rob the food bank?

Yeah, but do you think she'll like it?
What if she doesn't like it?

a Cracker Jack ring

140
00:06:44,402 --> 00:06:46,069
Hmm, let me guess:

141
00:06:46,138 --> 00:06:49,507
a romantic hot air
balloon ride perhaps.

142
00:06:49,574 --> 00:06:52,042
Oh, no, you just did that.

143
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,310
Was it scary up there

144
00:06:53,378 --> 00:06:56,713
with those itsy-bitsy
hairless hamster henchmen?

145
00:06:56,781 --> 00:06:59,517
I would have tussled
with them myself.

146
00:06:59,584 --> 00:07:01,118
Really?
Don't believe me?

147
00:07:01,186 --> 00:07:04,588
Listen, Sherlock, just 'cause
every ike in town relies

148
00:07:04,656 --> 00:07:06,690
on you to protect
them doesn't mean

149
00:07:06,758 --> 00:07:09,193
that I couldn't kick your butt.
Any time.

150
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:11,195
(laughs)

151
00:07:11,263 --> 00:07:12,329

you love my raisins, tough guy.

00:07:21,306 --> 00:07:22,906

156
00:07:22,974 --> 00:07:25,242
are you sweeping
me off my feet?

157
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,310
I'm working on it.

158
00:07:26,378 --> 00:07:29,079
(Sunshine laughs)

159
00:07:29,147 --> 00:07:31,515
SUNSHINE:
Dex.

160
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,849
All right, your
table's ready.

161
00:07:32,917 --> 00:07:35,586
We's got caviar,
filets mignons,

162
00:07:35,654 --> 00:07:39,856
and an outstanding array
of fruits and vegetables.

163
00:07:39,924 --> 00:07:42,258
Stay away
from the Brussels sprouts.

164
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:44,894
And-- forget about it...
for dessert, we got--

165
00:07:44,896 --> 00:07:48,965
Mmm, ice cream, my favorite.

166
00:07:49,033 --> 00:07:50,100
You want a lick?

167
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:52,369
Yes-- n-n-no, no.

168
00:07:52,437 --> 00:07:56,173
Oh, Dex,
this is so great.

169
00:07:56,241 --> 00:07:58,475
(playing loudly)
Sunshine, you mean the world...

170
00:07:58,543 --> 00:07:59,476
What?!

171
00:07:59,544 --> 00:08:01,478
You mean the
world to me!

172
00:08:01,546 --> 00:08:05,046
Maximillius!
- Hey, I likes you, too.

173
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,084
Oh, youse means her.

174
00:08:07,151 --> 00:08:10,254
I just want
to take care of you, baby.

175
00:08:10,322 --> 00:08:15,226
I do feel so safe in your arms
and I'm so proud of you, Dex,

176
00:08:15,293 --> 00:08:18,495
but I worry when you're
on a dangerous case.

177
00:08:18,563 --> 00:08:19,963
I'll be fine.

178
00:08:20,031 --> 00:08:23,500
Have to be to make sure
nothing bad ever happens to you.

179
00:08:23,568 --> 00:08:26,169
Always, Dex?

180
00:08:26,238 --> 00:08:28,138
Forever, kitten.

181
00:08:28,206 --> 00:08:29,640
Here goes.

182
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,941
Sunshine,
would you...?

183
00:08:32,009 --> 00:08:33,944
Takes cover, dollface, boss!

184
00:08:36,414 --> 00:08:37,948
(screaming)

185
00:08:38,983 --> 00:08:41,017
He's going to crash again!

186
00:08:44,789 --> 00:08:48,992
It looks like Danny's
drawing a picture.

187
00:08:50,094 --> 00:08:52,329
Of us!

188
00:08:52,397 --> 00:08:54,164
That's so

189
00:08:54,232 --> 00:08:56,099
cute!

190
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:58,869
But what's he trying
to draw on your hand?

191
00:08:58,936 --> 00:09:00,804
What I've been trying
to ask you

192
00:09:00,872 --> 00:09:02,939
all night!
Oh, no! He's not gonna try to...

193
00:09:03,007 --> 00:09:06,176
Just got to loop-de-loop
to make the engagement ring.

194
00:09:06,244 --> 00:09:10,213
For frying out loud, you've
never made the loop-de-loop!

195
00:09:10,282 --> 00:09:12,750
DAN:
No problem 'cause I'm gonna

196
00:09:12,817 --> 00:09:14,652
dare the day and...
Fly away!

197
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:17,321
Come on, Danny!
You can do it this time!

198
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:18,889
Sunshine, will you...?

199
00:09:18,956 --> 00:09:21,024
Dare the day and...

200
00:09:21,092 --> 00:09:23,560
(yelling)

201
00:09:23,628 --> 00:09:25,996
Not today. I better

202
00:09:26,063 --> 00:09:28,365
go check on Danny
just to make sure he's okay.

203
00:09:28,433 --> 00:09:31,134
I'm sure he's fine.
Dan always crashes.

204
00:09:31,202 --> 00:09:33,270
Like, yesterday, for example,
and the day before,

205
00:09:33,338 --> 00:09:36,840
and...  When in doubt, just do the
right thing, and it'll always

206
00:09:36,908 --> 00:09:39,142
turn out.
But I was trying to ask you...

207
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:41,211
Don't worry. It'll
just be a minute.

208
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,513
Save my ice cream.

209
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,048
I'll be right
back, okay?

210
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,257
I don't understand it.

211
00:09:54,326 --> 00:09:56,592
Sunshine went to check on you
right after the crash.

212
00:09:56,667 --> 00:09:58,228
No, I told you, dawg.
I didn't crash.

213
00:09:58,296 --> 00:10:00,831
I just...
- That was hours ago.  Where is she?

214
00:10:00,898 --> 00:10:02,265
Come on, man.
You know Sunshine.

215
00:10:02,334 --> 00:10:03,667
Sweetest ike in
the Marketropolis.

216
00:10:03,735 --> 00:10:05,001
She probably

217
00:10:05,069 --> 00:10:06,870
ran into a friend
who needed her help.

218
00:10:06,938 --> 00:10:08,639
Why didn't I just do it?

219
00:10:08,707 --> 00:10:10,874
Come on, it's getting late.
I mean, early.

220
00:10:10,942 --> 00:10:13,043
You know our rules.
We got to be out

221
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,645
of sight
before the market opens!

222
00:10:14,713 --> 00:10:16,513
We can't let the people see us.

223
00:10:16,581 --> 00:10:19,516
But I never got to ask her
to walk down the aisle with me.

224
00:10:19,584 --> 00:10:20,784
Chill, dawg!

225
00:10:20,852 --> 00:10:22,686
You can pop the question
tomorrow night.

226
00:10:22,754 --> 00:10:25,021
Don't worry. It ain't
like it's the last time

227
00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:27,524
you're ever gonna
see Sunshine again.

228
00:10:27,592 --> 00:10:29,159
(sighs)

229
00:10:29,227 --> 00:10:31,662
Sunshine, baby.

230
00:10:37,335 --> 00:10:39,570
(truck engine chugging)

231
00:10:39,637 --> 00:10:41,438
(engine chuffing)

232
00:10:41,506 --> 00:10:43,640
(low growling)

233
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,709
May I help you?

234
00:10:45,777 --> 00:10:48,812
You must be Leonard,
the manager.

235
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,749
I'm your new Brand X
representative.

236
00:10:51,816 --> 00:10:53,917
I wasn't expecting
any new products.

237
00:10:53,985 --> 00:10:55,886
Corporate picked your store

238
00:10:55,953 --> 00:10:58,154
to test the new
Brand X detergent

239
00:10:58,222 --> 00:11:00,290
with elixir!

240
00:11:00,358 --> 00:11:03,427
Brand X, huh?

241
00:11:03,495 --> 00:11:04,561
Never heard of it.

242
00:11:04,629 --> 00:11:06,397
Give us one week!

243
00:11:06,464 --> 00:11:08,965
Your cu... cu-cu... cu-cu...

244
00:11:09,033 --> 00:11:12,369
customers won't know
how they lived

245
00:11:12,437 --> 00:11:13,937
without Brand X.

246
00:11:14,005 --> 00:11:17,808
Well, everything is so nice
the way it is.

247
00:11:17,876 --> 00:11:19,777
We don't have space.

248
00:11:19,844 --> 00:11:22,212
Oh. (laughs)

249
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,248
I'll make space.

250
00:11:25,316 --> 00:11:27,083
(laughs)

251
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,621
Wait until you get a...

252
00:11:30,688 --> 00:11:31,955
(sniffs)

253
00:11:32,023 --> 00:11:34,758
...whiff of our Brand X elixir!

254
00:11:34,826 --> 00:11:38,862
It's practically addictive.

255
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,964
(groaning)

256
00:11:41,032 --> 00:11:45,368
That was a perfectly
good bag of chips.

257
00:11:45,437 --> 00:11:48,806
Survival of the
fittest, Leonard!

258
00:11:48,873 --> 00:11:51,174
Never opened.

259
00:11:51,242 --> 00:11:53,544
Never enjoyed.

260
00:11:53,611 --> 00:11:55,345
KRISPY:
No one wastes me chips

261
00:11:55,413 --> 00:11:57,013
and gets away with it.

262
00:11:57,081 --> 00:12:00,684
Brand X will pay!

263
00:12:00,752 --> 00:12:02,920
Argh!

264
00:12:11,796 --> 00:12:13,864
SUNSHINE:
<i>Dex!</i>

265
00:12:13,932 --> 00:12:15,365
Sunshine!

266
00:12:15,433 --> 00:12:17,468
Help me, Dex!

267
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,869
Please find me!
Please, Dex!

268
00:12:18,937 --> 00:12:21,304
I'll find you, Sunshine!
Don't leave me!

269
00:12:21,372 --> 00:12:22,639
Sunshine!
Dex!

270
00:12:22,707 --> 00:12:25,041
Sunshine!
Dex!

271
00:12:25,109 --> 00:12:26,577
Dex.
Where are you?

272
00:12:26,644 --> 00:12:28,011
Save me, Dex!

273
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,913
I'll find you, Sunshine!

274
00:12:29,981 --> 00:12:32,415
I love you, Dex!
I hope you find me.

275
00:12:32,484 --> 00:12:34,084
(yells)
(Dan sings)

276
00:12:34,151 --> 00:12:35,418
Come on, Dex!
Up and at 'em!

277
00:12:35,487 --> 00:12:37,320
Wake up, buddy!  Wake up!
- (clears throat)

278
00:12:37,355 --> 00:12:38,722
Hey, pal.

279
00:12:39,376 --> 00:12:41,525
You were having the nightmare
again, weren't you?

280
00:12:41,593 --> 00:12:43,794
Buddy, look,
I miss her, too.

281
00:12:43,862 --> 00:12:45,829
But, dude, it's
been six months.

282
00:12:45,897 --> 00:12:47,965
Sunshine's gone, bro.

283
00:12:48,032 --> 00:12:50,501
We got to accept it.

284
00:12:50,568 --> 00:12:51,802
(sighs)

285
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:55,205
I can't.
I failed her.

286
00:12:55,272 --> 00:12:57,173
Yo, it wasn't your fault!

287
00:12:57,241 --> 00:12:59,943
You-you kept this place
running smooth as a smoothie

288
00:13:00,011 --> 00:13:02,345
and all of us safe!
Just look at all these articles

289
00:13:02,413 --> 00:13:05,048
talking about all the millions
of cases you solved.

290
00:13:05,116 --> 00:13:07,450
Oh, yeah?
What about these?

291
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,653
"Raisin Riddle a Mystery!"

292
00:13:09,721 --> 00:13:11,889
"Leads Dry as Prunes."

293
00:13:11,956 --> 00:13:14,825
"Sunshine Goodness Gone
Without a Trace!"

294
00:13:14,893 --> 00:13:16,860
"Dex Dogtective
Hangs Up His Hat."

295
00:13:16,928 --> 00:13:19,530
The only case

296
00:13:19,597 --> 00:13:22,966
that ever really mattered,
and I couldn't solve it.

297
00:13:23,034 --> 00:13:25,402
Now, she's gone.
(sighs)

298
00:13:25,469 --> 00:13:26,904
Sunshine.

299
00:13:26,971 --> 00:13:30,007
My only Sunshine.

300
00:13:30,074 --> 00:13:32,743
Ok, so your detective days
are over, kaput.

301
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:35,512
But now, brother,
you've got a club to run!

302
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,214
And you can bet the CopaBanana's
gonna be buzzing tonight!

303
00:13:38,282 --> 00:13:40,183
Everybody's gonna be talking

304
00:13:40,251 --> 00:13:42,118
about how Krispy's bag
got crunched!

305
00:13:42,186 --> 00:13:43,620
Anyway, you want a lift?

306
00:13:43,688 --> 00:13:45,022
I got my wings right outside.

307
00:13:45,089 --> 00:13:46,356
Fly with you?!

308
00:13:46,424 --> 00:13:49,026
I'm sad, but I'm not crazy.

309
00:13:49,093 --> 00:13:51,562
Okay, you cool?

310
00:13:51,629 --> 00:13:52,863
See you tonight.

311
00:13:52,931 --> 00:13:54,898
Yeah, thanks, pal.

312
00:13:54,966 --> 00:13:58,669

00:14:02,607 --> 00:14:06,176

Why, of course I can provide you

354
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:37,467
with a backstage pass
to the CopaBanana,

355
00:15:37,535 --> 00:15:40,270
but my flightless
feathery friend,

356
00:15:40,337 --> 00:15:42,706
you don't appear
to have the correct coupons

357
00:15:42,774 --> 00:15:44,207
for such a pricy purchase.

00:15:44,275 --> 00:15:46,677
Excuse me, Cheasel

00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:24,567
on a new relationship.

541
00:23:24,635 --> 00:23:27,137
(sniffing)

542
00:23:27,204 --> 00:23:28,638
So, what happened to Dan?

543
00:23:28,705 --> 00:23:30,540
You already eat through
to his hollow center?

544
00:23:30,608 --> 00:23:32,074
He said the sugars and salts

545
00:23:32,143 --> 00:23:34,144
were gonna finish
what they started.

546
00:23:34,211 --> 00:23:36,930
The aisles aren't safe tonight
for a helpless lady...

547
00:23:37,448 --> 00:23:39,182
...like me.

548
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:43,586
Sorry, I'm not buying
this damsel-in-distress routine.

549
00:23:43,654 --> 00:23:45,421
You've been
through the wash plenty.

550
00:23:45,489 --> 00:23:47,323
I can see it in your eyes.

551
00:23:47,391 --> 00:23:48,591
You're right, Dex.

552
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:49,992
I'm not new.

553
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,227
Last year, I was...

554
00:23:51,295 --> 00:23:54,164
recalled.

555
00:23:54,231 --> 00:23:55,965
But I'm changed now.

556
00:23:56,033 --> 00:23:58,301
New ingredients,

557
00:23:58,369 --> 00:24:02,238
repackaged with a fresh scent,

558
00:24:02,306 --> 00:24:04,274
I want to forget my past

559
00:24:04,341 --> 00:24:07,143
just like you do.

560
00:24:08,745 --> 00:24:10,780
I can't forget.

561
00:24:10,847 --> 00:24:13,049
Oh, but you're wrong, Dex.

562
00:24:13,116 --> 00:24:14,450
(sniffing)

563
00:24:14,518 --> 00:24:17,820
I can wash away
your memories.

564
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:21,591
(screaming)

565
00:24:24,094 --> 00:24:27,063
Wait!

566
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:29,365
I haven't shown you
my secret ingredient.

567
00:24:29,433 --> 00:24:33,203
The secret's inside.

568
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:35,037
Oh, why did I agree to run

569
00:24:35,105 --> 00:24:37,807
the United Supermarket
Defense Association?

570
00:24:37,874 --> 00:24:40,743
Things were so much smoother
when Dex was in charge.

571
00:24:40,811 --> 00:24:43,213
Oh, Dex, Dex, thank
goodness you're here.

572
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,547
The salts and sugars.

573
00:24:44,615 --> 00:24:46,482
Oh, it must mean all-out war.

574
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:48,017
How many ikes went down?

575
00:24:48,085 --> 00:24:50,119
Everybody we threw out
of the friggin' Banana.

576
00:24:50,187 --> 00:24:53,590
Dan and Lady X
is the only ones missing.

577
00:24:53,657 --> 00:24:56,559
And the lady's got an alibi.

578
00:24:56,627 --> 00:24:59,061
Dex and I were just talking.

579
00:24:59,129 --> 00:25:01,130
I warned him
there might be trouble.

580
00:25:01,198 --> 00:25:04,100
We all knows when a
product loses its icon,

581
00:25:04,167 --> 00:25:05,635
it spoils, it goes bad.

582
00:25:05,703 --> 00:25:07,470
So, whats can we do here?

583
00:25:07,538 --> 00:25:08,638
Nothing.

584
00:25:08,706 --> 00:25:10,607
We're the soul of our products.

585
00:25:10,674 --> 00:25:14,009
Without us,
they're gone real fast.

586
00:25:14,077 --> 00:25:15,111
Oh, just...

587
00:25:15,178 --> 00:25:17,913
These ikes didn't expire
in a rumble.

588
00:25:17,981 --> 00:25:19,749
Somebody just wants it
to look that way.

589
00:25:19,816 --> 00:25:22,652
Are you saying
what I thinks youse is saying?

590
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,820
Rigamoldis has set in.

591
00:25:24,888 --> 00:25:27,290
Looks like all these poor ikes
were rubbed out.

592
00:25:27,358 --> 00:25:29,859
Oh, but why, how, who?

593
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:33,095
Dan. He said he was
gonna get back at the salts.
- Oh, goodness gracious.

594
00:25:33,163 --> 00:25:35,164
Dan would never do
anything like this.

595
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:37,767
We have to find him
before the rest of the salts do.

596
00:25:37,834 --> 00:25:39,469
Then you better
start styling, Harry.

597
00:25:39,536 --> 00:25:41,738
Right. What? Me? I can't.

598
00:25:41,805 --> 00:25:44,840
Oh, you have to help me, Dex,
before I go bald.

599
00:25:46,176 --> 00:25:47,943
Not that bald isn't beautiful.

600
00:25:48,011 --> 00:25:50,813
I don't get involved anymore.

601
00:25:50,881 --> 00:25:52,682
After losi''
Sunshine, boss,

602
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:55,585
I thought youse would
never smile again.

603
00:25:55,653 --> 00:25:58,220
But, Dan, he was
there for youse.

604
00:25:58,289 --> 00:25:59,389
M-my split ends.

605
00:25:59,456 --> 00:26:02,024
What to do?

606
00:26:05,496 --> 00:26:07,029
Oh, no.

607
00:26:07,097 --> 00:26:08,931
Nothing harder

608
00:26:08,999 --> 00:26:11,434
than seeing good food go bad.

609
00:26:11,502 --> 00:26:12,835
(laughs sinisterly)

610
00:26:12,903 --> 00:26:15,438
Looks like we arrived

611
00:26:15,506 --> 00:26:17,640
just in time.

612
00:26:19,576 --> 00:26:21,877
DEX:
<i>Brand X replacements</i>

613
00:26:21,945 --> 00:26:25,080
<i>for every ike lost last night.</i>

614
00:26:25,148 --> 00:26:28,785
<i>Now, how'd that</i>
<i>Mr. Clipboard guy know?</i>

615
00:26:28,852 --> 00:26:30,186
Something's wrong.

616
00:26:30,253 --> 00:26:33,856
Danny's in trouble.
I just know it.

617
00:26:33,924 --> 00:26:35,825
I let you down, Sunshine.

618
00:26:35,892 --> 00:26:39,195
I just can't throw
in the paper towel on Dan.

619
00:26:48,972 --> 00:26:50,373
He was your best friend, too.

620
00:26:56,313 --> 00:26:58,013
(gavel banging)
<i>I call this session</i>

621
00:26:58,081 --> 00:27:00,750
<i>of the United Supermarket</i>
<i>Defense Association</i>

622
00:27:00,818 --> 00:27:02,885
to order!

623
00:27:02,953 --> 00:27:04,887
(crowd clamoring)
The USDA must come to order!

624
00:27:04,955 --> 00:27:07,022
Why is everyone screaming?!

625
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:09,659
This only concerns
the sugars and the salts!

626
00:27:09,727 --> 00:27:11,060
Not anymore.

627
00:27:11,127 --> 00:27:13,262
General X, our esteemed
potato chip icon,

628
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:14,797
has just discovered
a diabolical plot

629
00:27:14,865 --> 00:27:16,666
against cleaning product ikes.

630
00:27:16,734 --> 00:27:19,935
Security around here
is down the Drano.

631
00:27:20,003 --> 00:27:23,072
And who is behind this vicious plan?
Who?!

632
00:27:23,139 --> 00:27:25,406
Oh, boy.
- A specialty ike.

633
00:27:25,542 --> 00:27:26,976
Kung Tofu!

634
00:27:27,043 --> 00:27:30,713
But I, Kung Tofu, am innocent!

635
00:27:30,781 --> 00:27:32,448
Everything's out of control!

636
00:27:32,516 --> 00:27:33,683
What are we going to do?

637
00:27:33,751 --> 00:27:34,950
Well,
(shrieks)

638
00:27:35,018 --> 00:27:37,353
Brand X is 30 strong now.

639
00:27:37,421 --> 00:27:39,522
This is our new home.

640
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:41,056
We want to help.

641
00:27:41,124 --> 00:27:43,626
Why not let my ikes maintain
order in the aisles?

642
00:27:43,694 --> 00:27:45,127
Why you?

643
00:27:45,195 --> 00:27:48,197
Dex Dogtective always mopped up
our troubles, <i>capisce?</i>

644
00:27:48,265 --> 00:27:50,065
Let's get him to come back!

645
00:27:50,133 --> 00:27:52,568
He quit,
but I will never give up

646
00:27:52,636 --> 00:27:57,339
because I care what happens
to each and every ike of you.

647
00:27:57,408 --> 00:28:00,443
(crowd murmuring)
But it's so dangerous.

648
00:28:00,511 --> 00:28:03,212
Don't cry for me, Charlie Tuna.

649
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:07,483
Trust me, Brand X will make
everything better.

650
00:28:07,551 --> 00:28:10,119
You have my promise.

651
00:28:10,186 --> 00:28:12,422
We will take care of you.

652
00:28:12,489 --> 00:28:15,491
But what about Dex?

653
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:18,728
Oh, we'll take care of him, too.

654
00:28:23,734 --> 00:28:27,002
(whimpering)

655
00:28:29,139 --> 00:28:32,241
The lady wants
the dogtective.

656
00:28:32,309 --> 00:28:36,412
Perhaps he's been
very, very bad.

657
00:28:37,548 --> 00:28:38,981
No problem.

658
00:28:39,049 --> 00:28:41,116
If you weren't so
desperately deficient

659
00:28:41,184 --> 00:28:44,153
with your coupon dispersals.

660
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:47,557
Or I could just kill you.

661
00:28:47,624 --> 00:28:50,593
That would be
lots of fun.

662
00:28:50,661 --> 00:28:53,696
More fun than a spanking.

663
00:28:53,764 --> 00:28:56,666
The dogtective will be dropped
off at the cleaners,

664
00:28:56,733 --> 00:28:57,767
posthaste.

665
00:28:57,835 --> 00:28:59,936
Speaking of clean,

666
00:29:00,003 --> 00:29:02,605
might I interest you

667
00:29:02,673 --> 00:29:03,706
in a toothbrush?

668
00:29:03,774 --> 00:29:06,241
(groans)

669
00:29:06,309 --> 00:29:09,078
I fear this will not
end happily...

670
00:29:09,145 --> 00:29:10,646
for me.

671
00:29:10,714 --> 00:29:12,047
(descending whistling)

672
00:29:12,115 --> 00:29:13,950
(tires screeching,
metallic crashing)

673
00:29:17,921 --> 00:29:21,023
(footsteps)

674
00:29:21,091 --> 00:29:22,925
CHEASEL:
Everybody seems to be searching

675
00:29:22,993 --> 00:29:24,927
for the flying squirrel.

676
00:29:24,995 --> 00:29:29,198
Mayhaps a reward for the
reckless rodent would be in the offing.

677
00:29:29,265 --> 00:29:32,466
If you've got something
up that slimy sleeve, spill the beans.

678
00:29:32,603 --> 00:29:35,736
Perhaps I do,
and perhaps I don't.

679
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:38,608
I seem to be suffering
from a touch

680
00:29:38,675 --> 00:29:41,677
of train-induced amnesia.

681
00:29:41,745 --> 00:29:43,078
Trix are for kids, Cheasel.

682
00:29:43,146 --> 00:29:44,947
Last night, I saw
the chocolate furball

683
00:29:45,015 --> 00:29:47,383
heading towards
the detergent aisle.

684
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:50,653
You know, home of
the lovely Lady X.

685
00:29:50,721 --> 00:29:51,821
When?

686
00:29:51,889 --> 00:29:55,290
Right after the screaming
started.

687
00:29:55,358 --> 00:29:58,594
Most suspicious.

688
00:29:58,662 --> 00:30:00,262
No way.
I know Dan.

689
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:01,864
He'd never leave
the scene of a crime.

690
00:30:01,932 --> 00:30:04,366
Not even for a hot dish
like Lady X.

691
00:30:04,434 --> 00:30:05,768
But this dish

692
00:30:05,836 --> 00:30:08,303
is extra spicy.

693
00:30:09,706 --> 00:30:10,873
It just doesn't add up.

694
00:30:10,941 --> 00:30:12,174
Wait, wait.

695
00:30:12,242 --> 00:30:14,877
May I suggest a calculator?

696
00:30:14,945 --> 00:30:16,812
Lucky for you,
I just happened to have procured

697
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,714
a boatload of fine...

698
00:30:18,782 --> 00:30:19,916
(clicking, whirring)

699
00:30:19,983 --> 00:30:22,518
(descending whistling)

700
00:30:26,256 --> 00:30:27,690
Pain,

701
00:30:27,758 --> 00:30:30,292
she's like an old friend.

702
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,028
(loud bang)

703
00:30:32,095 --> 00:30:33,429
(gulps)
Ah...

704
00:30:33,496 --> 00:30:36,032
Note to self...

705
00:30:36,099 --> 00:30:39,902
(muffled):
need new friend.

706
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:54,416
I still got it.

707
00:30:55,285 --> 00:30:57,687
(grunts)

708
00:30:57,754 --> 00:31:01,657
And I thought the raisins
were humiliating.

709
00:31:04,661 --> 00:31:06,729
(sniffing)

710
00:31:06,797 --> 00:31:08,297
LADY X:
Dex,

711
00:31:08,364 --> 00:31:10,232
sorry I'm not dressed.

712
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,702
I wasn't expecting company.

713
00:31:12,769 --> 00:31:17,907
I'd say things are going
exactly how you expected.

714
00:31:21,411 --> 00:31:24,513
(tango playing)

715
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:29,051
How about joining me
in a warm rinse?

716
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:31,520
I'm not that dirty.

717
00:31:33,423 --> 00:31:37,059
Oh, but being filthy
can be loads of fun.

718
00:31:37,127 --> 00:31:39,161
Don't you think so, Dex?

719
00:31:49,405 --> 00:31:52,708
There are some stains
you can never wash out.

720
00:31:52,776 --> 00:31:54,343
Let's try.

721
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:57,179
I want to scrub
your bubbles, Dex.

722
00:32:03,887 --> 00:32:06,956
I want to know how you rubbed
out all those ikes last night.

723
00:32:07,024 --> 00:32:08,290
Me?

724
00:32:08,358 --> 00:32:10,225
But I was with you, remember?

725
00:32:10,293 --> 00:32:12,427
Yeah. Trying to get
me on the case

726
00:32:12,495 --> 00:32:15,164
before there
even was one.

727
00:32:17,433 --> 00:32:19,434
BIRD: Poop on her head.
Aim for the hair.

728
00:32:19,502 --> 00:32:20,970
Naughty dog.

729
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:23,605
I've really been
on your mind, haven't I?

730
00:32:25,142 --> 00:32:28,010
(vase clanks,
electrical crackling)

731
00:32:31,281 --> 00:32:34,550
You've orchestrated this dance
from the start.

732
00:32:34,617 --> 00:32:35,785
I think you hijacked Dan

733
00:32:35,852 --> 00:32:38,020
and you've got him squirreled
away somewhere.

734
00:32:38,088 --> 00:32:39,922
My friend better be alive

735
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:43,959
or you're gonna check out
of this store the hard way.

736
00:32:44,027 --> 00:32:46,996
Your crash dummy's fine...
for now.

737
00:32:47,064 --> 00:32:49,165
But he won't be
unless you back Brand X.

738
00:32:49,232 --> 00:32:51,600
So that's your game.

739
00:32:52,836 --> 00:32:55,304
We could run
this store, Dex.

740
00:32:55,371 --> 00:32:56,939
An aisle all
to ourselves,

741
00:32:57,007 --> 00:33:00,042
packed tight, no
markdowns for us.

742
00:33:01,078 --> 00:33:03,445
I could be your Sunshine.

743
00:33:03,513 --> 00:33:05,715
There will never be
another Sunshine.

744
00:33:05,782 --> 00:33:08,084
Now I'm taking you in.

745
00:33:08,151 --> 00:33:12,054
Not before I solve
your case for you.

746
00:33:15,892 --> 00:33:17,426
Down, boy.

747
00:33:17,493 --> 00:33:19,161
(grunts)

748
00:33:20,997 --> 00:33:22,198
What a shame.

749
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,836
We could've been like
macaroni and cheese,

750
00:33:26,903 --> 00:33:28,470
peanut butter and jelly,

751
00:33:28,538 --> 00:33:30,706
Scotch and tape.

752
00:33:30,774 --> 00:33:33,275
DAN:
Dex, wake up!

753
00:33:33,343 --> 00:33:34,877
Come on, Dex, wake up!

754
00:33:34,945 --> 00:33:36,078
Dan?

755
00:33:36,146 --> 00:33:37,446
Dex, my man!

756
00:33:37,513 --> 00:33:39,815
I knew you'd sniff me out.
You okay, pal?

757
00:33:39,883 --> 00:33:41,416
Is your chocolate chipped?

758
00:33:41,484 --> 00:33:42,985
It was brutal.
She has these...

759
00:33:43,053 --> 00:33:46,055
these giant flying
mother X-o-bytes

760
00:33:46,123 --> 00:33:48,456
that slaughtered
every ike in sight.

761
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:50,492
But they didn't rub me out
because Lady X

762
00:33:50,571 --> 00:33:52,568
digs my fine flavor
and oh-so-sweet bod.

763
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:56,300
Or... maybe she used you
as bait to get to me?

764
00:33:56,366 --> 00:33:59,068
Oh, like you're the only ike
who could rescue me,

765
00:33:59,136 --> 00:34:01,003
figure out her game,
and shut her down.

766
00:34:01,071 --> 00:34:02,204
Uh...

767
00:34:02,272 --> 00:34:04,840
Oh, yeah, you are.

768
00:34:04,908 --> 00:34:08,210
Not even the great
Dex Dogtective can save you now.

769
00:34:08,278 --> 00:34:10,545
(maniacal laughter)

770
00:34:10,613 --> 00:34:11,781
(gasps)

771
00:34:11,848 --> 00:34:13,048
Dex,

772
00:34:13,116 --> 00:34:16,786
is it just me or
is it hot in here?

773
00:34:16,853 --> 00:34:20,055
After they've enjoyed
the extra-hot dry cycle,

774
00:34:20,123 --> 00:34:22,523
dump their bodies
in the toothpaste aisle.

775
00:34:22,537 --> 00:34:25,995
They frame toothpaste now?

776
00:34:26,062 --> 00:34:31,400
Everyone knows
toothpastes hate sugars.

777
00:34:31,467 --> 00:34:33,702
We're done soft-soaping.

778
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:34,770
Frame everybody!

779
00:34:34,838 --> 00:34:37,039
From spray starch
to sliced salami,

780
00:34:37,107 --> 00:34:38,540
from calories to carbs!

781
00:34:38,608 --> 00:34:42,344
Then Brand X will step in
and replace them all.

782
00:34:42,412 --> 00:34:44,379
It'll be a cakewalk.

783
00:34:44,447 --> 00:34:46,615
We're taking over,
so get out there

784
00:34:46,683 --> 00:34:48,784
and show 'em who's running
this store!   (grunts)

785
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:57,359
But, I, Kung Tofu, am innocent!

786
00:34:57,427 --> 00:34:59,695
What's that got
to do with it?

787
00:34:59,762 --> 00:35:01,030
I don't get it.

788
00:35:01,097 --> 00:35:03,332
I don't understand.

789
00:35:03,399 --> 00:35:05,734
I mean, we simply don't care.

790
00:35:08,972 --> 00:35:10,105
I am hot.

791
00:35:10,173 --> 00:35:11,307
Hot, hot, hot.

792
00:35:11,374 --> 00:35:13,008
Gonna fry. Gonna crisp.
Stay calm.

793
00:35:13,076 --> 00:35:14,643
We just gotta find
a way to get out.

794
00:35:14,657 --> 00:35:16,478
It's not natural.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

795
00:35:16,517 --> 00:35:18,847
If we just breathe and focus,
the answer will come.

796
00:35:18,942 --> 00:35:20,850
(grunts)
What?!

797
00:35:20,917 --> 00:35:23,252
I'm melting and you're getting
all martial art Zen?

798
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,087
You can put a... Sock!

799
00:35:25,155 --> 00:35:26,655
Socks! That's it!

800
00:35:26,723 --> 00:35:29,225
Socks always escape
from the dryer.

801
00:35:29,292 --> 00:35:30,792
Follow that sock!

802
00:35:30,861 --> 00:35:31,994
(Dan yells)

803
00:35:32,062 --> 00:35:33,195
(grunting)
Ow!

804
00:35:33,263 --> 00:35:34,997
(grunts)

805
00:35:35,065 --> 00:35:36,665
Ouch.

806
00:35:36,733 --> 00:35:39,335
Okay, pal,
you're safe now.

807
00:35:39,402 --> 00:35:40,936
Yo, yo, yo, wait,
whoa, time out.

808
00:35:41,004 --> 00:35:42,171
Where you going?

809
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:44,805
Look, Dan,
I just came to find you,

810
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:46,075
but that's it.  I don't...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,

811
00:35:46,142 --> 00:35:48,143
don't want to get involved
no more-- got it, check--

812
00:35:48,184 --> 00:35:50,419
but you might want to take
a look at this first.

813
00:36:09,299 --> 00:36:11,066
What the fudge?

814
00:36:11,134 --> 00:36:12,467
They're building

815
00:36:12,535 --> 00:36:15,271
an entire army
of robotic X-o-bytes!

816
00:36:15,338 --> 00:36:16,705
What's that oily liquid?

817
00:36:16,773 --> 00:36:17,973
Yo, I seen that.

818
00:36:18,041 --> 00:36:20,708
It's the same stuff
they shot at the Krispy

819
00:36:20,808 --> 00:36:22,476
and the other ikes when
they rubbed them out.

820
00:36:22,494 --> 00:36:25,133
They must be planning to finish
what they started last night.

821
00:36:25,135 --> 00:36:27,984
Brand X is gonna take over
the entire store!

822
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:29,852
Come on! Let's get 'em!
I'm ready to roll!

823
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:31,023
You with me?
Let's hit this!

824
00:36:31,087 --> 00:36:33,055
I ain't afraid.
Well, I am.

825
00:36:33,123 --> 00:36:34,323
You are?!

826
00:36:34,391 --> 00:36:35,991
R-Really? Why?

827
00:36:36,059 --> 00:36:37,492
You don't understand.

828
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,695
I don't know if I can cut
the mustard anymore.

829
00:36:39,696 --> 00:36:42,398
Yo, Dex, you gotta believe
in yourself.

830
00:36:42,465 --> 00:36:45,301
If Sunshine were
here, she would.

831
00:36:45,368 --> 00:36:47,169
You know,

832
00:36:47,237 --> 00:36:48,470
I do have an idea.

833
00:36:48,538 --> 00:36:50,406
Ah, now that's
more like it.

834
00:36:50,473 --> 00:36:52,707
Dex Dogtective is
back in the house.

835
00:36:52,775 --> 00:36:56,378
But it's really, really,
really dangerous.

836
00:36:56,446 --> 00:36:57,879
Wh-Wh... Wh-Wh...

837
00:36:57,948 --> 00:37:01,023
Hold up. How come you said
"really" three times?

838
00:37:01,023 --> 00:37:03,151
I never heard you say that.
I've heard "really dangerous"

839
00:37:03,216 --> 00:37:04,733
and "really, really,"
but this is three times.

840
00:37:04,733 --> 00:37:07,520
Come on, pal.  Let's snap, crackle
and pop out of here.

841
00:37:08,539 --> 00:37:10,459
(over speakers):
Attention all icons.

842
00:37:10,526 --> 00:37:12,894
Curfew is now in effect.

843
00:37:12,963 --> 00:37:18,500
Only Brand X officials
are permitted in the aisles.

844
00:37:18,568 --> 00:37:23,339
All violators will be punished.

845
00:37:23,406 --> 00:37:25,841
I do so hope
there are violators.

846
00:37:25,908 --> 00:37:28,610
I love a good violation.

847
00:37:28,678 --> 00:37:30,712
I love anything to do
with violation.

848
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,014
(laughing)

849
00:37:32,082 --> 00:37:34,383
(Dan grunting)

850
00:37:34,451 --> 00:37:37,219
Watch it now.
What is going on?

851
00:37:37,287 --> 00:37:39,455
We need you to analyze this.

852
00:37:39,522 --> 00:37:41,323
I borrowed it
from Lady X.

853
00:37:41,391 --> 00:37:42,858
I think
it's the secret ingredient

854
00:37:42,925 --> 00:37:44,059
in the Brand X Elixir.

855
00:37:44,127 --> 00:37:45,260
Brand X!

856
00:37:45,328 --> 00:37:46,628
Oh, Brand X!

857
00:37:46,696 --> 00:37:50,065
Oh, why me? Why?! Why Brand X?

858
00:37:50,133 --> 00:37:51,733
Come on, come on.
Why not, uh, let's see...

859
00:37:51,801 --> 00:37:53,768
Dr. Pepper, Dr. Scholl's,

860
00:37:53,836 --> 00:37:55,637
Dr. Feelgood!

861
00:37:55,705 --> 00:37:58,339
Anybody but me!
- Doc, Doc, Doc, snap out of it.

862
00:37:58,399 --> 00:38:00,675
You're the only one
with a nose for the job.

863
00:38:00,743 --> 00:38:02,211
(sneezes)

864
00:38:02,278 --> 00:38:03,578
Ew!

865
00:38:03,646 --> 00:38:06,748
Oh, this is just great!

866
00:38:06,816 --> 00:38:10,419
Okay, I'll give it a whiff.

867
00:38:10,487 --> 00:38:12,154
It can't be done.

868
00:38:12,222 --> 00:38:13,755
Oh, oh, why me?

869
00:38:15,425 --> 00:38:17,559
Wh-What's going on?

870
00:38:17,627 --> 00:38:22,131
We have reports that you're
plotting against sugars.

871
00:38:22,198 --> 00:38:23,632
Me?!

872
00:38:23,699 --> 00:38:25,700
I don't even
have fluoride!

873
00:38:25,768 --> 00:38:27,836
I'm just a whitener!

874
00:38:27,904 --> 00:38:31,673
Well, you know, I myself,
appreciate a good darkener.

875
00:38:31,741 --> 00:38:33,942
(laughing)

876
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:35,810
(whirring)

877
00:38:37,313 --> 00:38:40,582
NOSE (stammering):
<i>Oh, no, no, that's not right.</i>

878
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:42,584
That's odd.
That's definitely odd.

879
00:38:42,652 --> 00:38:44,853
My olfactor meter can't,
uh, can't fully identify

880
00:38:44,921 --> 00:38:46,188
the main ingredient.

881
00:38:46,256 --> 00:38:48,790
Oh, no, this I can tell you.

882
00:38:48,858 --> 00:38:51,260
The Brand X Elixir
is toxic to humans.

883
00:38:51,327 --> 00:38:52,594
Toxic?!

884
00:38:52,662 --> 00:38:54,163
Oh, and highly addictive.

885
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,364
Oh, addictive!

886
00:38:55,432 --> 00:38:57,632
(snaps fingers)
Addictive?

887
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:58,900
Okay, so that explains
why customers

888
00:38:58,968 --> 00:39:01,136
are buying up Brand X
products like crazy.

889
00:39:01,204 --> 00:39:02,604
How can we regular icons compete

890
00:39:02,672 --> 00:39:05,474
against... a-against
this irresistible elixir?

891
00:39:05,542 --> 00:39:07,676
We can't.

892
00:39:07,743 --> 00:39:09,711
Won't be long
and the whole store will be X.

893
00:39:09,779 --> 00:39:11,246
And the rest of us
discontinued.

894
00:39:11,314 --> 00:39:13,882
Oh, but there's so many noses
left to blow!

895
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,451
- Oh, man.
- I'm too young to be discontinued.

896
00:39:15,518 --> 00:39:16,785
I never even got a chance

897
00:39:16,852 --> 00:39:18,787
to play Lick the Icing
with Sweet Cakes.

898
00:39:18,854 --> 00:39:20,322
If we could just get
this info

899
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:21,823
to our market's
corporate headquarters,

900
00:39:21,891 --> 00:39:23,658
they'd have
to recall Brand X.

901
00:39:23,726 --> 00:39:25,194
How could you
possibly reach them?

902
00:39:25,261 --> 00:39:26,395
You couldn't. You...
E-mail.

903
00:39:26,463 --> 00:39:27,896
From Mr. Leonard's computer.

904
00:39:27,964 --> 00:39:29,731
But it's in
the expiration station,

905
00:39:29,799 --> 00:39:31,400
at the other end of the store.

906
00:39:31,468 --> 00:39:34,043
No, you'd never make it there
before the supermarket opens.

907
00:39:34,046 --> 00:39:36,007
You couldn't! You could try,
but you can't reach 'em!

908
00:39:36,072 --> 00:39:38,474
Do you understand
what I'm saying? Impossible!

909
00:39:38,541 --> 00:39:40,242
Then we cross
during the day.

910
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:41,443
Daytime?!

911
00:39:41,511 --> 00:39:42,944
No one has ever done that.

912
00:39:43,012 --> 00:39:44,045
Are you crazy?!

913
00:39:44,114 --> 00:39:45,714
What about all those humans
out there?

914
00:39:45,781 --> 00:39:47,549
The ones with the big feet.

915
00:39:47,617 --> 00:39:48,817
They're never supposed
to squash...

916
00:39:48,884 --> 00:39:51,120
I mean, see us
during the daytime.

917
00:39:51,187 --> 00:39:52,921
We'll be killed!

918
00:39:52,989 --> 00:39:56,843
But not that I can't handle that,
because I can.  'Cause I'm a natural ninja.

919
00:39:56,846 --> 00:39:59,352
We won't survive another night
against Brand X.

920
00:39:59,356 --> 00:40:00,866
It's our only shot.

921
00:40:03,766 --> 00:40:07,436
(screaming):
It's daytime...!

922
00:40:07,504 --> 00:40:09,638
<i>Oh, daytime! Oh, this is bad!</i>

923
00:40:09,705 --> 00:40:12,141
We must've lost hundreds
of ikes last night.

924
00:40:12,208 --> 00:40:13,442
Come on, pal.

925
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:15,677
Let's get going
before we lose any more.

926
00:40:15,745 --> 00:40:18,313
Oh, how the Jell-O
are we supposed to cross

927
00:40:18,381 --> 00:40:20,115
over ten aisles
of that?

928
00:40:20,183 --> 00:40:23,619
If the next thing you hear is,
"Clean up on aisle one,"

929
00:40:23,686 --> 00:40:25,420
you know we blew it.

930
00:40:25,488 --> 00:40:27,689
The next thing
you're going to hear

931
00:40:27,757 --> 00:40:32,561
to be the sound of me
eating you for the lunch.

932
00:40:33,177 --> 00:40:34,395
(mocking)  "The next thing
you're gonna hear

933
00:40:34,429 --> 00:40:36,231
is the sound of me
eating you for lunch."

934
00:40:36,299 --> 00:40:39,301
(laughs)  Look, you overstocked,
overstuffed lunch lizard,

935
00:40:39,369 --> 00:40:40,802
my friend Dex,

936
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:43,497
he'll make you stutter
with your butter.

937
00:40:43,499 --> 00:40:46,076
You won't survive his chives.

938
00:40:46,169 --> 00:40:48,119
DEX:
Are you crazy?  She's huge!

939
00:40:48,136 --> 00:40:50,247
Let's strawberry
jam out of here.

940
00:40:50,313 --> 00:40:52,714
(screams)

941
00:40:55,985 --> 00:40:58,920
(baby jabbering)

942
00:40:58,988 --> 00:41:02,424
No, Larry,
I am not buying that for you.

943
00:41:02,492 --> 00:41:04,593
(Dan whimpers)

944
00:41:04,661 --> 00:41:05,927
(screams)

945
00:41:05,995 --> 00:41:07,996
(grunts)

946
00:41:08,064 --> 00:41:09,298
Miss me?

947
00:41:09,365 --> 00:41:10,499
(laughs)

948
00:41:10,567 --> 00:41:11,766
Wait, wait, stop.
(stammers)

949
00:41:11,834 --> 00:41:14,603
We could, you know,
maybe try to date a bit.

950
00:41:14,671 --> 00:41:17,206
A... a movie?
A lunch?

951
00:41:17,273 --> 00:41:19,074
I kill you!

952
00:41:20,577 --> 00:41:22,477
Dex! Batter up, fool!

953
00:41:22,545 --> 00:41:24,112
(Dan laughs)

954
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,947
Where you go, my chipmunk?
- DAN: I love you!

955
00:41:26,015 --> 00:41:27,316
Dare the day!

956
00:41:27,383 --> 00:41:29,518
Mayday! Mayday!

957
00:41:29,586 --> 00:41:32,053
(Dan whimpers)

958
00:41:35,558 --> 00:41:37,593
DEX:
Polar!

959
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,328
You need to warn the other ikes.

960
00:41:39,395 --> 00:41:42,264
Brand X is behind the rubout.
(Dan screams)

961
00:41:42,332 --> 00:41:45,367
Bring as many ikes as you
can to the Banana tonight!

962
00:41:45,435 --> 00:41:47,035
And, thanks, Polar!

963
00:41:47,103 --> 00:41:49,371
That's what friends are for.

964
00:41:49,439 --> 00:41:50,539
DAN:
Wait. Wait, okay.

965
00:41:50,607 --> 00:41:53,073
MAN (over P.A.):
The store is now closed.

966
00:41:53,122 --> 00:41:54,642
We ain't gonna make it.
We ain't gonna make it.

967
00:41:54,686 --> 00:41:56,044
Trust me. I mean, I'm no
math major or anything,

968
00:41:56,112 --> 00:41:58,447
but we're going to hit the door.
- We'll be fine.

969
00:41:58,514 --> 00:42:01,650
No way! We're going to hit!
- We'll make it!

970
00:42:07,724 --> 00:42:10,592
I'm here.
My arms, my arms.

971
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,561
(laughing)
Oh, see? See?

972
00:42:12,629 --> 00:42:15,459
I told you we'd make it.
You didn't want to listen to me, right?

973
00:42:15,461 --> 00:42:16,867
We the bug bomb, bro!

974
00:42:16,932 --> 00:42:18,300
We...

975
00:42:18,368 --> 00:42:20,935
What?

976
00:42:21,003 --> 00:42:25,674
Yo, I never should've
tried to chip-slap Krispy.

977
00:42:25,742 --> 00:42:27,342
You can't blame
yourself, Dan.

978
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:28,777
It's the...
X-o-byte!

979
00:42:28,844 --> 00:42:31,112
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

980
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,281
What, are you crazy?

981
00:42:32,348 --> 00:42:34,383
You hit someone up here!

982
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:36,217
You think
it's duck season?

983
00:42:36,286 --> 00:42:37,419
Do I look like a mallard?

984
00:42:37,487 --> 00:42:39,321
Hold on, hold the line.

985
00:42:39,389 --> 00:42:41,490
(sniffing)

986
00:42:41,557 --> 00:42:46,261
Is that the enticing scent
of rich, creamy chocolate?

987
00:42:46,329 --> 00:42:48,196
Are you chocolate? Are
you made of chocolate?

988
00:42:48,264 --> 00:42:49,564
Really?

989
00:42:49,632 --> 00:42:51,132
That is so sweet.

990
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,234
Hi. Whoa!

991
00:42:53,303 --> 00:42:54,603
(thud)

992
00:42:54,671 --> 00:42:56,471
Vlad Chocool,
chocolate vampire.

993
00:42:56,539 --> 00:42:57,872
Used to have cards.

994
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:58,940
(laughs)

995
00:42:59,008 --> 00:43:00,909
Do you work out?
I use the ThighMaster.

996
00:43:00,976 --> 00:43:03,111
You're looking pretty good
for biting it.

997
00:43:03,179 --> 00:43:06,281
Excuse me, but they poisoned me
like the other ikes, okay?

998
00:43:06,349 --> 00:43:07,649
It's not my fault...

999
00:43:07,717 --> 00:43:09,418
Again with this.
What can I tell you?

1000
00:43:09,485 --> 00:43:11,320
I am the undead.

1001
00:43:11,387 --> 00:43:13,322
All right? The undead.

1002
00:43:13,389 --> 00:43:14,723
No, you're not dead,

1003
00:43:14,791 --> 00:43:16,658
but you're not exactly living,
either.

1004
00:43:16,726 --> 00:43:18,159
Sort of like being
in summer school.

1005
00:43:18,227 --> 00:43:19,494
(chuckles)

1006
00:43:19,562 --> 00:43:21,330
Oh, come on, that's funny.
Now, that's funny.

1007
00:43:21,397 --> 00:43:24,232
Let's not lose our senses
of humor.

1008
00:43:25,018 --> 00:43:27,216
(over speakers):
Mandatory security rally, tonight.

1009
00:43:27,686 --> 00:43:32,380
All icons must attend or face
the penalty of elimination!

1010
00:43:33,976 --> 00:43:35,677
FEMALE COMPUTERIZED VOICE:
How can I help?

1011
00:43:35,745 --> 00:43:37,078
Upload?

1012
00:43:37,146 --> 00:43:38,313
Download?

1013
00:43:38,381 --> 00:43:39,881
Scan?

1014
00:43:39,949 --> 00:43:43,518
Blue, we're gonna get corporate
to recall Brand X.

1015
00:43:43,586 --> 00:43:46,054
Can you bring
up a form?

1016
00:43:46,121 --> 00:43:49,807
Wait, don't tell me...
(inhales sharply)  bittersweet.

1017
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:53,019
Do you go out much, by the way?
'Cause I like to dance a little myself.

1018
00:43:53,022 --> 00:43:54,397
I dance a bit.
(stammers)

1019
00:43:54,448 --> 00:43:58,767
This instant glue
will seal their tomb.

1020
00:44:02,572 --> 00:44:06,241
Lovely word, "tomb."

1021
00:44:06,308 --> 00:44:08,744
(laughing maniacally)

1022
00:44:10,446 --> 00:44:11,747
(glue gurgling)

1023
00:44:11,814 --> 00:44:14,082
(sniffs)
Loony Glue.

1024
00:44:14,149 --> 00:44:16,117
They're locking us in.

1025
00:44:16,185 --> 00:44:17,586
What? In here?

1026
00:44:17,653 --> 00:44:18,787
W-With him?

1027
00:44:18,855 --> 00:44:20,655
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, back off!

1028
00:44:20,723 --> 00:44:22,724
I'll work with Blue,
you fly around

1029
00:44:22,792 --> 00:44:24,789
and check for loose vent grates.

1030
00:44:26,295 --> 00:44:28,838
DAN:  Have you flipped
your flapjacks?

1031
00:44:28,841 --> 00:44:29,967
CHOCOOL:  Anyone have glasses
they don't need?

1032
00:44:30,004 --> 00:44:31,765
DAN:  Would you fly straight?!
- (both grunt)

1033
00:44:31,834 --> 00:44:32,967
Ow!
Ow!

1034
00:44:33,035 --> 00:44:34,969
Ow!
Oh, golly, that hurt.

1035
00:44:35,037 --> 00:44:37,071
Uh-huh, yeah, good.
(sighs)

1036
00:44:37,139 --> 00:44:38,440
Good plan.
(bones cracking)

1037
00:44:38,508 --> 00:44:41,009
Maybe we'll just dent
our way out of here.

1038
00:44:41,076 --> 00:44:42,010
Ow!

1039
00:44:42,077 --> 00:44:45,044
Maybe my eyes aren't that good,
but if you would just let me lead.

1040
00:44:45,114 --> 00:44:47,448
Well, the phrase isn't
"blind as an eagle," is it?

1041
00:44:47,474 --> 00:44:48,517
No, it's "blind as a bat."

1042
00:44:48,584 --> 00:44:49,718
What do you think I am?

1043
00:44:49,786 --> 00:44:51,052
And with you on my back yet.

1044
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,454
Not that I mind that.

1045
00:44:53,723 --> 00:44:55,457
Scanning forms.

1046
00:44:55,525 --> 00:44:59,127
Only two recalls on file.

1047
00:44:59,194 --> 00:45:01,463
"Priscilla Pusley's
genetically gigantic prunes."

1048
00:45:01,531 --> 00:45:04,665
DAN:   What kinda fool
needs a bigger prune?

1049
00:45:04,764 --> 00:45:05,834
CHOCOOL:  We coming up to something?

1050
00:45:05,902 --> 00:45:07,035
(both grunting)

1051
00:45:07,102 --> 00:45:08,169
Nobody.

1052
00:45:08,237 --> 00:45:10,338
Priscilla had the worst sales
in store history.

1053
00:45:10,406 --> 00:45:13,742
Okay, I guess I'll be
the bad guy once again

1054
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:15,877
and say
what everyone's thinking.

1055
00:45:15,945 --> 00:45:17,512
She's also hideous.

1056
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:20,816
No, I mean, come on, she's
very unattractive because

1057
00:45:20,883 --> 00:45:21,883
she-she's a prune.

1058
00:45:21,951 --> 00:45:23,017
What do we expect
from her?

1059
00:45:23,085 --> 00:45:24,985
Why are we shy
about these things?

1060
00:45:25,047 --> 00:45:26,354
Be what you are,
that's what I say.

1061
00:45:26,422 --> 00:45:27,456
In her case it's...

1062
00:45:27,523 --> 00:45:28,557
horrible.

1063
00:45:28,624 --> 00:45:31,755
BLUE: And here is
the other recall.

1064
00:45:31,894 --> 00:45:34,028
S-Sunshine recalled?

1065
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:38,163
Who ordered it?
-No name.  Address only.

1066
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:40,769
Same location as
Priscilla Pusley's recall.

1067
00:45:40,837 --> 00:45:42,203
That's impossible.

1068
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:44,940
Sunshine and Priscilla had
different manufacturers.

1069
00:45:45,007 --> 00:45:46,675
Blue, run a search
on that address

1070
00:45:46,742 --> 00:45:50,111
against all
the manufacturers on file.

1071
00:45:55,184 --> 00:45:58,687
Brand X ordered
both the recalls.

1072
00:45:58,754 --> 00:46:01,055
Dex, I just
don't get it.

1073
00:46:01,123 --> 00:46:05,727
Brand X took my Sunshine away.

1074
00:46:05,795 --> 00:46:07,796
Easy, easy, bro.

1075
00:46:07,864 --> 00:46:09,330
I know how you feel.

1076
00:46:09,398 --> 00:46:12,400
No, no one can,
not even you.

1077
00:46:12,468 --> 00:46:15,203
Okay, but, look,
you got to stay focused

1078
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:19,040
or Brand X is gonna take
everything else you love, too.

1079
00:46:19,108 --> 00:46:21,142
Not while I'm still breathing.

1080
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:22,711
Blue, we have
to send a form

1081
00:46:22,778 --> 00:46:25,547
to recall all
of Brand X's products.

1082
00:46:26,716 --> 00:46:30,284
Pull the plug on these traitors.

1083
00:46:31,687 --> 00:46:33,822
B-Bye, ikes.

1084
00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:36,090
(laughs)

1085
00:46:36,158 --> 00:46:38,393
BLUE:
Sending now.

1086
00:46:39,461 --> 00:46:42,230
What happened?

1087
00:46:42,297 --> 00:46:43,932
Do you all see
it get darker, too?

1088
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,834
Oh, good, for a second
I thought I was having a...

1089
00:46:45,902 --> 00:46:49,335
Whoa, mood lighting, though.
You devil dog, look at you.

1090
00:46:49,438 --> 00:46:51,105
Brand X must have killed
the power.

1091
00:46:51,173 --> 00:46:53,107
But, but the e-mail
went through, right?

1092
00:46:53,175 --> 00:46:56,077
Maybe, but now we can't count

1093
00:46:56,145 --> 00:46:58,212
on headquarters
coming to save us.

1094
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,548
But you said
we ain't gonna survive the night

1095
00:46:59,615 --> 00:47:01,382
unless headquarters
gets rid of Brand X.

1096
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:04,653
I don't understand...
I don't get it.

1097
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:05,921
So, what do
we do now?

1098
00:47:05,988 --> 00:47:07,221
Fight.

1099
00:47:07,289 --> 00:47:08,790
Come on, let's get up
to that vent

1100
00:47:08,858 --> 00:47:10,525
and over
to the CopaBanana.

1101
00:47:10,593 --> 00:47:13,028
The oven timer
is ticking.

1102
00:47:19,669 --> 00:47:23,805
There are only two kinds
of product icons.

1103
00:47:23,873 --> 00:47:28,643
Desirable like me...

1104
00:47:29,745 --> 00:47:32,080
...and undesirable.

1105
00:47:32,147 --> 00:47:35,617
We must send all the
undesirables where they belong--

1106
00:47:35,685 --> 00:47:36,851
the Expiration Station.

1107
00:47:36,919 --> 00:47:38,286
(crowd gasps)

1108
00:47:38,353 --> 00:47:40,622
Better hope Polar brings
a banana boatload of ikes

1109
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:41,623
to the Copa tonight.

1110
00:47:41,691 --> 00:47:44,292
Look around.

1111
00:47:44,359 --> 00:47:47,693
Do you see an ike
with an inferior product?

1112
00:47:49,364 --> 00:47:52,002
Turn in the undesirables.

1113
00:47:52,356 --> 00:47:55,773
Join Brand X
for a better way of life.

1114
00:47:56,672 --> 00:47:58,607
Ah.

1115
00:47:58,674 --> 00:48:02,477

1118
00:48:08,651 --> 00:48:10,752
Kiwi Koala did it.
No, no, I didn't do any...

1119
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:12,220
Jeepers!

1120
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:13,554
There must be
some mistake.

1121
00:48:13,623 --> 00:48:15,624
Hey, hey, wait, where
are you taking me?

1122
00:48:15,691 --> 00:48:18,192
From this day forward
you must prove

1123
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:21,029
you are desirable.

1124
00:48:21,097 --> 00:48:25,066
Soon we will become

00:55:59,188 --> 00:56:01,322
You be attacking now!

1245
00:56:01,390 --> 00:56:02,523
Cream them!

1246
00:56:48,003 --> 00:56:50,571
(slurps)

1247
00:56:56,945 --> 00:56:59,580
(cheering)

1248
00:57:02,751 --> 00:57:04,885
Fools!
I'll destroy them all!

1249
00:57:04,953 --> 00:57:06,220
(laughs)

1250
00:57:06,288 --> 00:57:08,422
(groans)

1251
00:57:08,490 --> 00:57:12,193
LADY X:
All units, go!

1252
00:57:13,395 --> 00:57:16,897
Armies, attack!

1253
00:58:11,453 --> 00:58:13,487
(grunting)

1254
00:58:13,555 --> 00:58:16,123
(groaning)

1255
00:58:50,925 --> 00:58:53,561
(mechanical whirring)

1256
00:58:59,568 --> 00:59:01,769
(groans)

1257
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:21,989
Hey.

1258
00:59:22,056 --> 00:59:23,223
Whip them!

1259
00:59:23,292 --> 00:59:25,225
Whip them bad!

1260
00:59:45,447 --> 00:59:47,782
(grunting)

1261
00:59:56,692 --> 00:59:59,026
Run while you can,
Dex Dogtective!

1262
00:59:59,093 --> 01:00:02,262
For soon, I'll have you sitting
up and begging for mercy.

1263
01:00:02,331 --> 01:00:04,632
X-o-bytes, fly!

1264
01:00:14,242 --> 01:00:16,977
We'll see who
rolls over, baby.

1265
01:00:17,045 --> 01:00:19,246
Okay, everyone ready?

1266
01:00:19,314 --> 01:00:21,248
(chewing)

1267
01:00:23,318 --> 01:00:25,386
Then let's gum up

1268
01:00:25,454 --> 01:00:28,188
her works!

1269
01:00:28,256 --> 01:00:31,058
They're nothing
but overgrown mosquitoes...

1270
01:00:31,125 --> 01:00:32,960
with gigantic deadly stingers!

1271
01:00:33,027 --> 01:00:34,695
And there's a ton of 'em!

1272
01:00:34,763 --> 01:00:38,399
And they wanna kill me!

1273
01:00:50,579 --> 01:00:53,614
(explosions)

1274
01:00:53,682 --> 01:00:57,251
(hums quietly)

1275
01:01:00,455 --> 01:01:02,590
You are getting sleepy.

1276
01:01:02,657 --> 01:01:04,759
I am getting...
(thud)

1277
01:01:07,696 --> 01:01:12,065
Mm-ma-mana-mac-chocolate...

1278
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:21,074
(explosions)

1279
01:01:31,586 --> 01:01:33,220
Dare the day!

1280
01:01:33,288 --> 01:01:34,588
(laughs)

1281
01:01:34,656 --> 01:01:35,956
(screams)

1282
01:01:36,024 --> 01:01:37,758
Run away! Run away!

1283
01:01:40,762 --> 01:01:43,731
Holy guacamole, run!

1284
01:01:43,799 --> 01:01:45,900
Squash them all!

1285
01:01:45,967 --> 01:01:48,302
Pudding and strudel
is what I think about.

1286
01:01:48,369 --> 01:01:49,503
That and myself.

1287
01:01:49,571 --> 01:01:52,205
LADY X:
Fry their eggs!

1288
01:02:04,719 --> 01:02:08,021
(explosions)

1289
01:02:11,827 --> 01:02:13,193
(whimpers)

1290
01:02:16,030 --> 01:02:20,334
(explosions)
Head for the Banana!

1291
01:02:20,401 --> 01:02:22,570
I'm exquisite!

1292
01:02:22,637 --> 01:02:24,705
Annihilate them!

1293
01:02:24,773 --> 01:02:26,774
Go!

1294
01:02:26,842 --> 01:02:31,078
(explosions)

1295
01:02:31,145 --> 01:02:33,781
I'm getting hot in here.

1296
01:02:33,849 --> 01:02:36,517
Maximillius, phase two, go!

1297
01:02:36,585 --> 01:02:39,152
Maybe I shouldn't oughta
eaten that last donut.

1298
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:42,122
Food goes right
to my butt.

1299
01:02:42,190 --> 01:02:43,624
It's okay, Maximillius!

1300
01:02:43,692 --> 01:02:45,793
Being able to do fun things,
like eating donuts,

1301
01:02:45,861 --> 01:02:47,995
is what we are fighting for!

1302
01:02:48,062 --> 01:02:50,865
But, you might wanna keep it
under, like, 40 at a time.

1303
01:02:50,932 --> 01:02:52,533
But whose are we gonna find

1304
01:02:52,601 --> 01:02:55,636
to slithers in filthy
slime through the sewers,

1305
01:02:55,704 --> 01:02:57,671
go into enemy territory

1306
01:02:57,739 --> 01:02:59,172
and cut the power lines

1307
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:01,709
to starts the lightning storm?

1308
01:03:01,776 --> 01:03:04,077
Ah, slither and slime?

1309
01:03:04,145 --> 01:03:07,781
It would appear you're in need
of a professional.

1310
01:03:07,849 --> 01:03:10,518
How do we know
you're not with Brand X?

1311
01:03:10,585 --> 01:03:12,019
According to the lady,

1312
01:03:12,086 --> 01:03:14,522
I'm the poster boy
for undesirable icons.

1313
01:03:14,589 --> 01:03:16,256
You know, boss,

1314
01:03:16,324 --> 01:03:18,358
if you don't mind
the suggestion,

1315
01:03:18,426 --> 01:03:20,928
we could fights fire
with fire here.

1316
01:03:20,996 --> 01:03:23,797
Welcome to the war, Weasel.

1317
01:03:23,865 --> 01:03:26,734
'Tis a far, far better thing
I do

1318
01:03:26,801 --> 01:03:28,936
than I have ever done before.

1319
01:03:29,004 --> 01:03:30,370
Well, you got to admit,

1320
01:03:30,438 --> 01:03:32,472
that's not saying much.
Whoa!

1321
01:03:32,541 --> 01:03:35,910

You lied to me!

1339
01:04:42,410 --> 01:04:45,445
Lied to you?

1340
01:04:45,513 --> 01:04:47,447
That's not true.

1341
01:04:47,515 --> 01:04:50,517
I did no more
than you let me do.

1342
01:04:50,585 --> 01:04:51,819
You handed me this store

1343
01:04:51,886 --> 01:04:54,088
on a party platter.

1344
01:04:54,155 --> 01:04:56,724
Frog's legs for dinner?

1345
01:04:56,791 --> 01:04:59,493
He knows their plan,

1346
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:01,394
but refuses to talk.

1347
01:05:01,462 --> 01:05:02,997
No, that's
gonna hurt!

1348
01:05:03,064 --> 01:05:04,164
I'll take that.

1349
01:05:04,232 --> 01:05:06,600
Then he won't talk to anyone,

1350
01:05:06,668 --> 01:05:08,135
ever again!

1351
01:05:08,202 --> 01:05:10,436
Knife coming!
- Enough!

1352
01:05:10,571 --> 01:05:11,972
I don't like her.
She's very mean!

1353
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:13,440
Careful, Harry,

1354
01:05:13,508 --> 01:05:15,909
if you value what little
hair you have left.

1355
01:05:15,977 --> 01:05:17,745
What's the point...

1356
01:05:17,812 --> 01:05:20,247
of luxurious locks...

1357
01:05:20,314 --> 01:05:23,550
if you can't look yourself
in the mirror?  Dear!

1358
01:05:26,788 --> 01:05:29,621
Oh, my goodness!
- Let him go!

1359
01:05:30,454 --> 01:05:32,192
He'll be exterminated

1360
01:05:32,260 --> 01:05:34,695
like the rest of them!

1361
01:05:55,253 --> 01:05:57,515
Polar!
I thought I told you

1362
01:05:57,518 --> 01:06:00,403
to go to the Banana!
- See, Dex, I can help.

1363
01:06:02,569 --> 01:06:04,204
No!

1364
01:06:07,696 --> 01:06:12,532
Another pathetic ike
bites the dust.

1365
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:15,703
No one puts Polar
in the freezer.

1366
01:06:15,770 --> 01:06:19,339
I'm marking you down,
shrimp toast.

1367
01:06:19,407 --> 01:06:20,741
It wasn't my fault!

1368
01:06:20,809 --> 01:06:23,077
I was just following orders.

1369
01:06:23,144 --> 01:06:24,845
I don't even like her.

1370
01:06:24,913 --> 01:06:25,946
Lady X promised she would

1371
01:06:26,014 --> 01:06:28,381
make me tall and thin.

1372
01:06:28,449 --> 01:06:31,484
DEX:
Then you finally got your wish.

1373
01:06:35,289 --> 01:06:38,759
I'm gonna pop
your corn, lady.

1374
01:06:38,827 --> 01:06:40,627
Roll over, Dogtective.

1375
01:06:40,695 --> 01:06:42,429
You're mine.

1376
01:06:53,942 --> 01:06:55,209
(groans)

1377
01:06:55,276 --> 01:06:59,546
Long live la resistance! La...

1378
01:07:00,915 --> 01:07:04,785
Adios, my brave
cheese puff ike.

1379
01:07:17,232 --> 01:07:20,033
(whimpers)

1380
01:07:20,101 --> 01:07:21,601
(sighs)

1381
01:07:21,669 --> 01:07:23,203
Hang in there, Polar.

1382
01:07:23,271 --> 01:07:25,538
If you're ever

1383
01:07:25,606 --> 01:07:28,408
in that big freezer
in the sky,

1384
01:07:28,476 --> 01:07:31,779
you got a friend, Dex.

1385
01:07:31,846 --> 01:07:33,847
Oh.

1386
01:07:33,915 --> 01:07:35,215
Use the whole box.

1387
01:07:35,283 --> 01:07:37,117
Polar would have
liked it that way.

1388
01:07:37,185 --> 01:07:38,952
DOCTOR:
Dex, Dex!

1389
01:07:39,020 --> 01:07:41,321
I ran tests on the poison

1390
01:07:41,389 --> 01:07:43,957
liquid the X-o-bytes
are stinging our ike...

1391
01:07:44,025 --> 01:07:46,359
(whimpers)  ...ikes with--
- Doc, Doc, Doc, so, what is it?

1392
01:07:46,781 --> 01:07:48,324
It's a deservative.

1393
01:07:48,327 --> 01:07:49,429
Okay, imagine
the chemical

1394
01:07:49,497 --> 01:07:51,364
opposite of a preservative,
huh, yeah?

1395
01:07:51,432 --> 01:07:55,202
One dose causes the victim to
spoil in his own unique way.

1396
01:07:55,270 --> 01:07:58,172
A cookie crumbles;
ice cream gets freezer burn.

1397
01:07:58,239 --> 01:08:00,473
Oh, chips chip,
crackers crack,

1398
01:08:00,541 --> 01:08:02,776
aluminum is foiled!
Don't you see?

1399
01:08:02,844 --> 01:08:04,577
Snot happens!

1400
01:08:04,645 --> 01:08:07,114
This is a big booger
we're bouncing into even!

1401
01:08:07,182 --> 01:08:08,748
I get the picture.

1402
01:08:08,817 --> 01:08:11,285
We need an antidote, fast!

1403
01:08:11,352 --> 01:08:13,287
(cries)
Ham it, Dex!

1404
01:08:13,354 --> 01:08:16,743
I'm a nose doctor,
not a miracle worker!  - Go!

1405
01:08:16,747 --> 01:08:17,828
What is with this guy?
He's always asking me

1406
01:08:17,831 --> 01:08:19,963
to do the impossible things. I
can't do the impossible things!

1407
01:08:20,028 --> 01:08:23,454
If I could do them, they
wouldn't be possibly impossible!

1408
01:08:23,457 --> 01:08:24,988
(panting)

1409
01:08:25,255 --> 01:08:28,066
Ow!  (glass breaking)
I'm fine! Nobody saw that! Ah!

1410
01:08:28,752 --> 01:08:31,404
All the lightning rods are
in place, I guarantee it.

1411
01:08:32,376 --> 01:08:33,907
Well, pretty guaranteed.

1412
01:08:33,975 --> 01:08:35,475
I mean, it's almost guaranteed.

1413
01:08:35,543 --> 01:08:37,744
I can't guarantee it.

1414
01:08:37,812 --> 01:08:39,479
Well, because...
my eyes aren't that good!

1415
01:08:39,547 --> 01:08:41,014
I don't see that well!

1416
01:08:41,082 --> 01:08:43,450
But my heart's in
the right place, if I had one.

1417
01:08:43,517 --> 01:08:46,786
Now, phase two is up
to Cheasel the Weasel.

1418
01:08:46,855 --> 01:08:47,888
That idiot?

1419
01:08:47,956 --> 01:08:51,258
I mean, fantastic.
I'll go check again.

1420
01:08:51,326 --> 01:08:52,792
Easy, Dan, easy.

1421
01:08:52,861 --> 01:08:54,895
(explosions)
Man,

1422
01:08:54,963 --> 01:08:56,663
phase two ain't gonna work.

1423
01:08:56,731 --> 01:08:59,266
Not with all those
X-o-bytes swarming. There's...

1424
01:08:59,334 --> 01:09:01,301
There's just too many of 'em.

1425
01:09:01,369 --> 01:09:03,670
They're refueling their poison

1426
01:09:03,738 --> 01:09:05,672
inside the
Brand X building.

1427
01:09:05,740 --> 01:09:08,275
Can you fly me over
Lady X's aisle?

1428
01:09:08,343 --> 01:09:10,310
Oh, yeah, sure. No prob.

1429
01:09:10,378 --> 01:09:12,312
Except I don't have
a death wish!

1430
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:14,147
If I can cut off
their poison supply,

1431
01:09:14,215 --> 01:09:15,949
maybe we can turn
this thing around!

1432
01:09:16,017 --> 01:09:17,484
(explosion)

1433
01:09:17,551 --> 01:09:19,353
Dex, suppose you make it in?

1434
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:21,355
There's no way you'll get out.

1435
01:09:21,422 --> 01:09:23,891
It's suicide!

1436
01:09:29,964 --> 01:09:32,199
(explosion)

1437
01:09:32,267 --> 01:09:34,700
Like Sunshine always
used to say,

1438
01:09:34,713 --> 01:09:37,436
"When in doubt, just do the right thing
and you can't go wrong."

1439
01:09:37,464 --> 01:09:39,739
Yeah, man, but
I don't want to lose you, too.

1440
01:09:39,807 --> 01:09:41,942
Hey, pal, you're the one
who convinced me

1441
01:09:42,010 --> 01:09:43,277
to get back in the game.

1442
01:09:43,344 --> 01:09:44,744
You never stopped believing
in me,

1443
01:09:44,812 --> 01:09:46,746
even when I stopped
believing in myself.

1444
01:09:46,814 --> 01:09:48,515
That's 'cause you're the best.

1445
01:09:48,582 --> 01:09:51,018
But if you go in there,
you ain't coming out.

1446
01:09:51,085 --> 01:09:52,252
Don't do it, Dex!

1447
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:53,653
You should be here with us.

1448
01:09:53,721 --> 01:09:56,390
I should have been
with you the whole time.

1449
01:09:56,457 --> 01:09:59,859
But after Sunshine,
I just gave up.

1450
01:09:59,928 --> 01:10:01,228
I let you all down.

1451
01:10:01,296 --> 01:10:04,331
(explosion)

1452
01:10:04,399 --> 01:10:05,832
I know now that
my problems

1453
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:08,335
are just a hill of
coffee beans compared

1454
01:10:08,403 --> 01:10:10,837
to our store, our world,

1455
01:10:10,905 --> 01:10:12,505
our family.

1456
01:10:12,573 --> 01:10:13,941
If I don't make it back,

1457
01:10:14,008 --> 01:10:16,209
I'm counting on you
to take my place, pal.

1458
01:10:16,277 --> 01:10:18,711
Me? No, I can't.

1459
01:10:18,779 --> 01:10:21,548
You <i>can</i> do it, Dan.
I believe in you.

1460
01:10:21,615 --> 01:10:23,516
This place won't be
the same without you.

1461
01:10:23,584 --> 01:10:25,752
<i>I</i> won't be.

1462
01:10:25,820 --> 01:10:28,322
The secret's inside, old buddy.

1463
01:10:28,389 --> 01:10:30,590
You'll be just fine. So,

1464
01:10:30,658 --> 01:10:34,394
am I flying, or am I walking?
- All right.

1465
01:10:34,533 --> 01:10:36,298
Let's win this sucker!

1466
01:10:48,943 --> 01:10:50,177
(clanking)

1467
01:10:50,244 --> 01:10:52,980
Oh!
(thudding and clinking)

1468
01:10:53,047 --> 01:10:54,281
(cat yowling)

1469
01:10:54,349 --> 01:10:56,783
(clanking)

1470
01:10:58,286 --> 01:10:59,919
(whirring)

1471
01:10:59,988 --> 01:11:04,691
(wind whipping)

1472
01:11:04,758 --> 01:11:07,627
(sniffing)

1473
01:11:14,302 --> 01:11:16,769
(saw buzzing)

1474
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,041
(tires screeching)

1475
01:11:21,109 --> 01:11:23,310
(wood creaking)

1476
01:11:23,378 --> 01:11:25,412
(creaking continues)

1477
01:11:28,849 --> 01:11:30,450
Agony.

1478
01:11:30,518 --> 01:11:33,120
She's like my loyal beloved.

1479
01:11:33,187 --> 01:11:36,156
You got loyal

1480
01:11:36,224 --> 01:11:38,125
beloved!

1481
01:11:38,192 --> 01:11:42,729
I want you... loyal beloved!

1482
01:11:42,796 --> 01:11:44,831
(growling)

1483
01:11:44,899 --> 01:11:45,999
(grunts)

1484
01:11:46,067 --> 01:11:48,101
Allow me to introduce you.

1485
01:11:48,169 --> 01:11:50,070
(grunts)

1486
01:11:50,138 --> 01:11:52,272
(creaking and thudding)

1487
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:54,041
(electrical hissing)

1488
01:11:54,108 --> 01:11:55,942
(thunderous explosions)

1489
01:11:56,010 --> 01:12:01,048
Note to self:
Cheasel T. Weasel rocks.

1490
01:12:01,115 --> 01:12:03,083
(engine whining, explosions)

1491
01:12:03,151 --> 01:12:05,585
DAN:
Okay, okay.

1492
01:12:05,653 --> 01:12:08,121
Hey, Dex, don't worry, bro.

1493
01:12:08,189 --> 01:12:09,622
I'm gonna get you closer.

1494
01:12:09,690 --> 01:12:11,591
Once more into the
bleach, my friend.

1495
01:12:11,659 --> 01:12:13,660
Once more.
(whimpers)

1496
01:12:13,727 --> 01:12:15,762
Uh, Dex?

1497
01:12:15,829 --> 01:12:17,830
Dex!

1498
01:12:17,898 --> 01:12:20,200
(explosions)
Dare the day, Dex.

1499
01:12:20,268 --> 01:12:24,538
Dare the day.
(engine revving)

1500
01:12:24,605 --> 01:12:27,307
(metallic clank,
low rolling thunder)

1501
01:12:27,375 --> 01:12:30,477
Uh, Dex's plan is working!

1502
01:12:30,545 --> 01:12:32,645
Duh, but I still
do not know how.

1503
01:12:32,713 --> 01:12:34,481
MOOSE:
Like a meatball, this guy!

1504
01:12:34,549 --> 01:12:37,284
Cheasel's starting
an electrical lightning storm.

1505
01:12:37,351 --> 01:12:41,688
We put lightning rods on all
our buildings to keep 'em safe.

1506
01:12:41,755 --> 01:12:44,691
Brand X don't have lightning
rods, so they gets destroyed.

1507
01:12:44,758 --> 01:12:47,394
A true spark of genius.

1508
01:12:47,462 --> 01:12:50,063
The boss is a regular
Benjamin Franklin!

1509
01:12:50,131 --> 01:12:54,501
Yeah. Uh, duh,
who's Benjamin Franklin?

1510
01:12:54,569 --> 01:12:56,970
Benjamin Franklin with
the key and the kite,

1511
01:12:57,037 --> 01:12:59,539
the lightning, the...
Uh, what aisle is he in?

1512
01:12:59,607 --> 01:13:01,174
Ah, forget about it.

1513
01:13:01,242 --> 01:13:04,578
(distant explosions)

1514
01:13:06,614 --> 01:13:09,082
(whirring, liquid gurgling)

1515
01:13:10,518 --> 01:13:13,386
(metallic clinking,
wind whipping)

1516
01:13:13,454 --> 01:13:15,355
(wind whipping)

1517
01:13:15,423 --> 01:13:20,127
(clang, explosions,
glass breaking)

1518
01:13:20,194 --> 01:13:21,428
I'm coming for you, Lady.

1519
01:13:21,496 --> 01:13:23,930
(crackling, thudding)

1520
01:13:23,998 --> 01:13:25,532
(thunder rumbling)

1521
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:27,167
Sunshine!

1522
01:13:27,235 --> 01:13:28,268
Dex!

1523
01:13:28,336 --> 01:13:29,603
Hold it right there,

1524
01:13:29,670 --> 01:13:32,172
or Blondie gets it.

1525
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:33,507
SUNSHINE:
Watch out!

1526
01:13:33,574 --> 01:13:36,042
On your knees, Dog.

1527
01:13:41,915 --> 01:13:45,084
(hissing, thunder rumbling)

1528
01:13:45,153 --> 01:13:48,355
I always knew you
were damaged goods.

1529
01:13:48,422 --> 01:13:52,025
I'm not the one
who's gonna be poppy-whipped,

1530
01:13:52,092 --> 01:13:54,794
you cold-farted itch.

1531
01:13:54,862 --> 01:13:57,497
Exterminate them both.

1532
01:13:58,533 --> 01:14:00,099
Her first.

1533
01:14:00,168 --> 01:14:04,103
Make him watch
his Sunshine fade away.

1534
01:14:04,172 --> 01:14:07,440
With <i>great</i> pleasure.

1535
01:14:07,508 --> 01:14:09,976
(loud thunderclap,
glass breaking)

1536
01:14:11,745 --> 01:14:14,514
Okay, then,
I'll just leave you to it.

1537
01:14:16,150 --> 01:14:19,052
(thunderclap)

1538
01:14:19,119 --> 01:14:21,054
Ow! (groaning)

1539
01:14:21,121 --> 01:14:22,589
I thought
that only worked in movies.

1540
01:14:22,657 --> 01:14:25,858
(wind whipping)

1541
01:14:25,926 --> 01:14:27,494
Raisins, Dex!

1542
01:14:29,763 --> 01:14:32,599
(wind whipping,
ricocheting)

1543
01:14:32,667 --> 01:14:35,235
(whistling)

1544
01:14:35,303 --> 01:14:37,036
(grunts)

1545
01:14:37,104 --> 01:14:39,206
Well, this isn't
very much fun, is it?

1546
01:14:39,273 --> 01:14:40,407
(groans)

1547
01:14:40,474 --> 01:14:41,941
I think I've just wet myself.

1548
01:14:42,009 --> 01:14:43,410
(gasps)

1549
01:14:43,477 --> 01:14:45,078
It feels rather nice.

1550
01:14:45,145 --> 01:14:46,213
Oh!
(thud)

1551
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:49,782
(hissing, thunder rumbling,
explosion)

1552
01:14:54,855 --> 01:14:56,189
Oh, Dex.

1553
01:14:56,257 --> 01:14:58,358
I knew you'd find me.

1554
01:14:58,426 --> 01:15:00,527
I'm sorry. I thought you were...

1555
01:15:00,595 --> 01:15:03,463
I'm here.
We're together.

1556
01:15:03,531 --> 01:15:05,565
My world is whole
again, kitten.

1557
01:15:05,633 --> 01:15:08,735
I never stopped
believing in you, Dex.

1558
01:15:08,802 --> 01:15:11,137
And I always kept you
close to my heart.

1559
01:15:11,205 --> 01:15:14,807
My big, tough guy.

1560
01:15:14,875 --> 01:15:16,476
What have they done to you?

1561
01:15:16,544 --> 01:15:20,046
Brand X took my essence.

1562
01:15:20,114 --> 01:15:21,615
Of course!

1563
01:15:21,682 --> 01:15:22,982
The perfumed smell.

1564
01:15:23,050 --> 01:15:25,218
That's why it
was familiar.

1565
01:15:25,286 --> 01:15:30,189
The secret ingredient
in their elixir.

1566
01:15:30,258 --> 01:15:33,760
The evil X turned your
sweetness, your goodness

1567
01:15:33,827 --> 01:15:35,094
into something vile.

1568
01:15:35,162 --> 01:15:38,064
(loud rumbling thunder,
wooden creaking)

1569
01:15:45,172 --> 01:15:47,974
The whole thing
could go any minute.

1570
01:15:48,041 --> 01:15:51,478
As long as I'm with you,
nothing else matters.

1571
01:15:51,545 --> 01:15:53,079
(plane engine buzzing)

1572
01:15:54,448 --> 01:15:57,116
(hissing, explosion)

1573
01:15:57,184 --> 01:16:00,219
Only one way he can make it in time!
- Not the--

1574
01:16:00,288 --> 01:16:01,821
Yes, kitten, the loop-de-loop.

1575
01:16:01,889 --> 01:16:03,490
He's never pulled it off.

1576
01:16:03,557 --> 01:16:05,158
Come on, Dan.
You the man.

1577
01:16:05,225 --> 01:16:07,761
(engine revving)
You got to be... for them!

1578
01:16:07,828 --> 01:16:09,729
You can do it, pal!
Just believe it!

1579
01:16:09,797 --> 01:16:11,864
Believe in yourself!
Come on!

1580
01:16:11,932 --> 01:16:13,833
That's it, Dan!
The loop-de-loop!

1581
01:16:13,901 --> 01:16:16,703
He'll get it this time;
I know he will.

1582
01:16:20,541 --> 01:16:22,575
Oh,

1583
01:16:22,643 --> 01:16:24,911
dare the day!

1584
01:16:31,552 --> 01:16:33,620
Whoo!

1585
01:16:33,688 --> 01:16:36,389
ALL:
Dare the day and fly away.

1586
01:16:36,457 --> 01:16:37,657
Yes,

1587
01:16:37,725 --> 01:16:40,593
the sun is shining again,
baby!

1588
01:16:40,661 --> 01:16:41,928
Whoo! Look at you.

1589
01:16:41,995 --> 01:16:43,430
Bring me anything?
Give me a hug.

1590
01:16:43,497 --> 01:16:45,998
It's so good to see you.

1591
01:16:46,066 --> 01:16:48,000
SUNSHINE:
I just knew you'd do it, Danny.

1592
01:16:48,068 --> 01:16:50,169
DEX:
Me too, pal, me too.

1593
01:16:50,237 --> 01:16:52,772
SUNSHINE:
Dex, something's wrong.

1594
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:54,374
What's happening?

1595
01:16:54,442 --> 01:16:57,844
I understand that somebody

1596
01:16:57,911 --> 01:17:01,514
ordered a recall.

1597
01:17:01,582 --> 01:17:03,182
Dan, go find Lady X.

1598
01:17:03,250 --> 01:17:05,752
I've got a bone to pick
with this guy.

1599
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:08,054
No, Dex, you can't.

1600
01:17:08,121 --> 01:17:09,356
Not a human.

1601
01:17:09,423 --> 01:17:10,757
You'll be crushed.

1602
01:17:10,825 --> 01:17:13,224
I'll be fine.
I have to be,

1603
01:17:13,260 --> 01:17:15,662
to make sure nothing bad
ever happens to you.

1604
01:17:20,267 --> 01:17:22,736
Maximillius, Lola,
let's bring him down.

1605
01:17:22,803 --> 01:17:23,936
You got it, boss.

1606
01:17:24,004 --> 01:17:27,106
<i>Mi comprendo</i> big time,
<i>jefe.</i>

1607
01:17:32,847 --> 01:17:33,946
Hey, whack job.

1608
01:17:34,014 --> 01:17:36,315
It's checkout time.

1609
01:17:36,384 --> 01:17:38,184
You pompous pip-squeak.

1610
01:17:38,252 --> 01:17:40,453
I'll stomp you into oblivion.

1611
01:17:41,989 --> 01:17:43,857
I was hoping you'd say that.

1612
01:17:43,924 --> 01:17:45,258
I'll crush

1613
01:17:45,325 --> 01:17:47,427
your little friends

1614
01:17:47,495 --> 01:17:49,362
into icon stew.

1615
01:18:05,446 --> 01:18:07,346
(mechanical hissing)

1616
01:18:12,553 --> 01:18:14,654
A robot?

1617
01:18:14,722 --> 01:18:17,356
Extraordinary, aren't I?

1618
01:18:17,425 --> 01:18:20,059
How the Ho-Ho's
can this be happening?

1619
01:18:20,127 --> 01:18:22,429
Don't you recognize me,
Dogtective?

1620
01:18:22,496 --> 01:18:24,096
Sunshine's old neighbor?

1621
01:18:24,164 --> 01:18:25,331
Priscilla?

1622
01:18:25,399 --> 01:18:28,701
From Priscilla Pusley's
Genetically Giant Prunes?

1623
01:18:28,769 --> 01:18:30,603
But you were recalled.

1624
01:18:30,671 --> 01:18:32,104
And butt-ugly.

1625
01:18:32,172 --> 01:18:35,207
Quick trip to Brazil
for a little plastic surgery,

1626
01:18:35,275 --> 01:18:37,276
and I'm back for my revenge.

1627
01:18:37,344 --> 01:18:39,879
So, you built yourself
a human robot

1628
01:18:39,947 --> 01:18:41,448
and recalled Sunshine.

1629
01:18:41,515 --> 01:18:45,552
Then you stole her essence
to make your elixir for Brand X?

1630
01:18:45,619 --> 01:18:47,886
Why?
All anyone ever wanted

1631
01:18:47,888 --> 01:18:49,823
was that sweet
Sunshine Goodness.

1632
01:18:49,890 --> 01:18:51,724
Two months I sat on the shelf

1633
01:18:51,792 --> 01:18:53,392
next to little Miss Perfect.

1634
01:18:53,461 --> 01:18:57,296
No one bought my beautifully,
genetically giant prunes.

1635
01:18:57,364 --> 01:19:00,299
But how did you get in
and out of the store?

1636
01:19:00,367 --> 01:19:01,568
You're an ike.

1637
01:19:01,635 --> 01:19:03,035
Humans.

1638
01:19:03,103 --> 01:19:05,638
When you look like this,
you can get them to do anything.

1639
01:19:05,706 --> 01:19:07,640
Size only counts for men.

1640
01:19:07,708 --> 01:19:09,408
(stammering)

1641
01:19:09,477 --> 01:19:10,810
Clever plan, Pus,

1642
01:19:10,878 --> 01:19:14,481
but Brand X is being recalled.

1643
01:19:14,548 --> 01:19:15,815
You'll never get me.

1644
01:19:15,883 --> 01:19:18,050
I still have my elixir;
I'll be back.

1645
01:19:18,118 --> 01:19:21,153
But enough about me.
Let's kill you.

1646
01:19:24,057 --> 01:19:26,091
DAREDEVIL DAN:
Yo, dog, put your guard up.

1647
01:19:26,259 --> 01:19:28,027
Sugar smack upside
her prune head!

1648
01:19:28,095 --> 01:19:29,529
Put your arms--
- MAXIMILLIUS:  Forget about it.

1649
01:19:29,597 --> 01:19:31,297
Boss'll never, ever hit a dame.

1650
01:19:31,365 --> 01:19:34,033
Tell me something.
Uh, are those melons real?

1651
01:19:37,137 --> 01:19:39,506
MAXIMILLIUS:
He should Pudding Pop her one.

1652
01:19:39,573 --> 01:19:40,940
That ain't his MO.

1653
01:19:41,008 --> 01:19:41,875
Forget about it.

1654
01:19:41,942 --> 01:19:43,543
He won't hit her.

1655
01:19:43,611 --> 01:19:45,211
Not now, not never.

1656
01:19:45,278 --> 01:19:46,813
But I will.

1657
01:19:48,749 --> 01:19:50,550
The bimbo's mine.

1658
01:19:50,618 --> 01:19:52,652
Get ready, Lady,
'cause I'm gonna kick you

1659
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:54,120
where the sun don't shine.

1660
01:19:56,256 --> 01:19:58,124
Bring it on;
let's go.

1661
01:20:01,061 --> 01:20:03,830
You're not so tough now.

1662
01:20:12,105 --> 01:20:13,706
DAREDEVIL DAN:
Oh, look at you!

1663
01:20:13,774 --> 01:20:14,974
Sunshine chip-slapped her

1664
01:20:15,042 --> 01:20:16,175
back to ugly.

1665
01:20:16,243 --> 01:20:17,410
SUNSHINE:
Gross.

1666
01:20:18,913 --> 01:20:21,781
It doesn't have
to end like this.

1667
01:20:21,849 --> 01:20:24,784
All I ever really wanted
was you.

1668
01:20:24,852 --> 01:20:28,120
Well, you, and world domination.

1669
01:20:28,188 --> 01:20:31,591
Frankly, my dear,
I don't give a Spam.

1670
01:20:31,659 --> 01:20:34,594
Oh, the indignity of it all!

1671
01:20:34,662 --> 01:20:36,829
Dan, wrap her up and take her

1672
01:20:36,897 --> 01:20:39,065
to the Expiration Station
for recall

1673
01:20:39,132 --> 01:20:41,233
with the rest
of Brand X.

1674
01:20:41,301 --> 01:20:43,302
I heard there was a resistance.

1675
01:20:43,370 --> 01:20:46,739
(giggles)
Call me fashionably late.

1676
01:20:46,807 --> 01:20:49,375
You may be mostly fluff, Harry,

1677
01:20:49,443 --> 01:20:52,278
but the rest of you is pretty strong stuff.
- Oh, I'm off

1678
01:20:52,345 --> 01:20:54,447
for a quick calm down
and shot of toodly-pip.

1679
01:20:54,514 --> 01:20:56,215
Nice work, everybody.

1680
01:20:56,283 --> 01:20:59,118
Dex, Dex, Dex, I found
an antidote to the deservative.

1681
01:20:59,186 --> 01:21:00,853
It should bring all the ikes

1682
01:21:00,921 --> 01:21:02,254
back to life.

1683
01:21:02,322 --> 01:21:06,755
Oh, joy!
Let's give it a whiff, huh?

1684
01:21:06,994 --> 01:21:10,563
I knew you'd save me, friend.

1685
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:14,601
Oh, my.

1686
01:21:14,668 --> 01:21:16,769
But it's still chilly.

1687
01:21:16,837 --> 01:21:19,639
Oh, Dex,
I'm so proud of you.

1688
01:21:19,707 --> 01:21:21,240
You saved us all.

1689
01:21:21,308 --> 01:21:24,877
We saved each other
because the secret is inside.

1690
01:21:24,945 --> 01:21:26,512
Inside all of us!

1691
01:21:26,580 --> 01:21:28,081
All right, see?

1692
01:21:28,148 --> 01:21:30,083

turned out perfect.
