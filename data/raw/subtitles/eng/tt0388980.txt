1
00:00:24,229 --> 00:00:29,229
This is a true story...

2
00:00:33,057 --> 00:00:38,557
ISLE OF JERSEY - ENGLAND - 1879

3
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,736
Who are you?

4
00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:53,738
What are you doing?

5
00:01:53,821 --> 00:01:56,741
There's a golf links
going in here.

6
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:58,826
What's golf?

7
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:02,330
Golf is a game
played by gentlemen.

8
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:04,415
Not for the likes of you.

9
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:07,335
Now, run along, boy.

10
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,314
Here it is, sir.

11
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:08,826
Come on! Let's go!

12
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:54,622
That's it.
Sit up straight, Sarah.

13
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:58,209
Lightly on the reins. There.

14
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,011
This is how we do it, Francis.

15
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,306
We work hard, and we bring
home the money.

16
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,440
Work hard.
Bring home the money.

17
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:56,017
Guillermo!
- Yes, sir!

18
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,435
Come on!

19
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:48,236
Francis, what in the world
are you doin'?

20
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,031
It's after midnight!

21
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,410
You're keepin' your
brother up. Go to bed.

22
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:01,040
Raymond, go to sleep.
No talkin'.

23
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:03,418
No noises. I mean it.

24
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:11,426
What have you got there,
Francis? Hmm?

25
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,721
Francis.

26
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:19,434
Can I see him, Father? Please?

27
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,936
What's he talking about?
See who?

28
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:24,022
Harry Vardon.

29
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,905
Any gentleman
who plays this game

30
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,115
is not a friend to you.

31
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,742
I know.

32
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,619
But he's the greatest ever.

33
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,331
Arthur, I don't see the harm in...
- Not another word.

34
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,418
The boy goes to school today.

35
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,503
That's the end of it.

36
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:56,304
Mrs. Darcy, mind the little one!

37
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,515
He'll try to climb those stairs.

38
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,935
Francis, leave your books.

39
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:05,313
I've got shoppin' to do.
You come with me now.

40
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,440
Father said
I had to go to school.

41
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:09,108
You can miss school for one day.

42
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:12,111
Besides, I need help
with me packages. Come along.

43
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,844
What could be
causing such a fuss?

44
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:40,515
Go on. I'll find ya.

45
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:10,712
Oooh!

46
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,931
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

47
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,017
I'll now presume
upon your goodwill

48
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,227
and request the services
of a volunteer.

49
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,230
Anyone?

50
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,405
Oh!

51
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,908
Hello. What's your name?

52
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,744
Francis.
- Hello, Mr. Francis.

53
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:47,832
Now, do you know
what this is?

54
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,418
A brassie.

55
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,004
So it is.
Have a bash.

56
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,520
Go on.

57
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:15,109
That's all right, Francis.
Even in our darkest hour,

58
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:18,112
we must always remember,
you never despair.

59
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,615
Have you held
a live bird in your hands?

60
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:23,826
Not too hard to hurt her.

61
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,829
Just firm enough to stop it
from flying away.

62
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,917
Try it again.

63
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:42,637
Oooh!

64
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,805
Did you see that?

65
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,918
Hail the conquering hero!

66
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,336
Mr. Darwin.

67
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:20,008
Is this what I think it is?
- I'm not sure, Harry.

68
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,427
I received a summons
from Lord Northcliffe,

69
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,013
just as you did.
- Keep the change, mate.

70
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,640
He's waiting inside.
- Today's the day.

71
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:30,810
But, Harry, no professional
has ever been asked

72
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,104
to join a gentlemen's
golf club as a member.

73
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,106
First time for everything, Bernard.

74
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,941
Yes.
- Look at this place.

75
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:38,943
Why else would they
want you here?

76
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:41,529
He doesn't confide in me.
I only work for him.

77
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:47,118
Ten years ago,
I was clippin' hedges.

78
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:51,706
Mmm.

79
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:57,045
Marvelous.

80
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:00,632
Brilliantly done, Harry.

81
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,510
Thank you, sir.

82
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:07,222
I'd be honored if you
gentlemen would consider

83
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:10,433
adding it to your trophy case.
- A glittering addition.

84
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:13,520
We'd be pleased to keep it for you.
Wouldn't we, Neville?

85
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:15,230
Handsome.

86
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:19,025
But you might not get it back
without a tussle.

87
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,819
Don't plan on handing it back
myself without a fight.

88
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,113
Harry,
I'll come to the point.

89
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:26,324
We've had an opening at our club.

90
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:30,119
Lord Bullock chairs
the membership committee.

91
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,539
What does
your father do?

92
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,541
Uh, he's a gardener on Jersey, sir.

93
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:36,543
I'm told you're Church of Rome.

94
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:39,420
Mother's French?
- Yes, sir.

95
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:43,132
I believe we can work around it.

96
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,720
It's decided, then.
You're just the man for us.

97
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,523
Well, I don't know
what to say, sir.

98
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:00,525
Well, say yes.

99
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,944
We want you to work for us.
Decent wage.

100
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,612
You can run your own shop.

101
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,740
Lessons, of course.
Charge what you like for those.

102
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,743
You're the only man
who can set me right.

103
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:13,121
You'll have your work cut out.

104
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:15,123
I think it's drinks all around.

105
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:17,917
I'm told you'll work for us...

106
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,919
Golf is a game
played by gentlemen.

107
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,422
Not for the likes of you.
Played by gentlemen.

108
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:24,924
Run your own shop. Decent wage.

109
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:26,342
Run along, boy.

110
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:51,326
Francis. It's after midnight.

111
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:53,036
Just one more, Mother.

112
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,233
Mr. Hastings!

113
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:26,236
Ah, Master Francis.
- Sir.

114
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:28,738
We now lack but one essential

115
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,324
to complete the swift
appointment of our round:

116
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:34,244
Your clubs.
- My clubs, sir?

117
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:38,122
Caddies aren't allowed on the course.
If Mr. Campbell sees me out there...

118
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:42,126
You let me worry about Campbell.
Go. Get those clubs.

119
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,337
You go, boy.
Get those clubs.

120
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:45,922
Hup, hup, hup, hup!

121
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:05,817
Well struck, lad.
- Thank you, sir.

122
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:02,332
What did you shoot?

123
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,334
Uh, an 81, sir.

124
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,419
What did you take on 15?

125
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:07,921
A nine, sir.

126
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:09,923
So you shot an 81
first time around

127
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:12,926
on the toughest golf course
in New England?

128
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:16,012
With a nine?
- Well, I... I think I...

129
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:19,724
I saw you standing there, knowing
caddies aren't supposed to play...

130
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:21,643
Go on.

131
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:25,021
I... I think I got
a little nervous, sir.

132
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,607
We needed to see how
you handled yourself.

133
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:29,609
Handled myself?

134
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:33,238
National Amateur Championship's
here next month.

135
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:38,826
Are you saying that I can...

136
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,828
What do I have to do?

137
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:43,915
You have to play in the qualifier.
- That's the easy part.

138
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:46,543
You have to be approved
by the executive committee.

139
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,420
You're a caddie here?

140
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:51,631
Yes, sir.
For ten years.

141
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:54,634
I recently resigned to preserve
my status as an amateur.

142
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:57,303
What, no plans
to turn professional?

143
00:18:57,428 --> 00:19:00,223
Uh, no, sir. I plan
to have a career in business.

144
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,725
Oh, business?
- Yes.

145
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,435
What sort of business?

146
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:06,521
Howard, we need...

147
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,231
Sorry. Carry on.

148
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,942
What's your home club?
I don't see it here.

149
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:12,944
They have to sponsor you.

150
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:15,405
My home club?

151
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:20,535
I'm between clubs at the moment.
- Look, see here.

152
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:22,537
you may have qualified
as a player,

153
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,707
but this just isn't the sort
of thing that caddies do.

154
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:28,209
You're a caddie?

155
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:29,711
Yes, sir, I was.

156
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:33,214
Caddies don't play in the Amateur.
It's not for your kind.

157
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:35,008
Members only.

158
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:38,011
We need to discuss the opening
on the greens committee.

159
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:39,929
I'm sorry.
But there must be a way

160
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:42,515
for somebody who's not
a member to compete.

161
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,434
Not this year.

162
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:53,026
As if he could afford
the $50 entrance fee.

163
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:57,238
Excuse me. Sir...

164
00:19:57,322 --> 00:20:00,825
...if I were to pay the $50,
would I need to belong to a club?

165
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,035
Technically, no.

166
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:09,834
You would still need a club member
in good standing to sponsor you, and...

167
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:12,921
And... that would be me.

168
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,925
Fifty dollars to play golf.

169
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:19,344
I'll pay back every penny
from my earnings.

170
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:22,639
Is this how I failed you?
Is that all you've learned from me?

171
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,641
No, sir.
But it's just a game.

172
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:26,809
A game?

173
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:30,939
A game doesn't give a man what he
needs to make a life, feed his family.

174
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:32,941
If I win,
great things could happen.

175
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:35,026
Nothing will happen.

176
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:38,404
They'll use you
for their own amusement.

177
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:41,533
I can do this. This is
something I'm good at.

178
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,536
What if you do?

179
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:46,621
What will you get for your $50?

180
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,544
I had dreams too, Francis.

181
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:55,004
No matter what you do,

182
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:57,340
they'll never let you
cross that street.

183
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:01,719
All I want is a chance.

184
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:09,644
OK.

185
00:21:11,521 --> 00:21:13,231
OK, we make a bargain.

186
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:17,318
You promise me if you lose,
no more golf.

187
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:18,903
You give up this fool's game.

188
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:21,739
You finish your schooling,
you learn a trade,

189
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:25,243
and you bring home
an honest wage.

190
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,538
If I don't qualify?

191
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:31,207
Yes, I promise.

192
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:04,032
It's the English edition.
It's not even in print here yet.

193
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:06,910
Harry Vardon.

194
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:10,830
Thank you.

195
00:22:10,914 --> 00:22:13,124
Read it, study it.

196
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:16,544
You'll need a 78 to qualify.

197
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:18,213
Stiffer competition.

198
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:20,715
These are the best
amateurs in the country.

199
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:23,718
Do you think I'm ready?

200
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:26,638
I don't know, and neither
will you until you're in it.

201
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:29,641
There's golf, and there's
championship golf.

202
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:37,815
Keep it for me.
I'm going to the party.

203
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:42,320
They said all the players
are invited.

204
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,533
What's it like in there?

205
00:22:46,616 --> 00:22:49,327
I couldn't tell you.
I'm not allowed inside.

206
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:39,711
Do me a favor, would you?

207
00:23:39,836 --> 00:23:41,421
Hi.

208
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:46,009
Hi. This boy I used to see
before I left for college is after me.

209
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:49,012
Pretend you asked me to dance.
- There you are, you peach.

210
00:23:49,137 --> 00:23:51,306
You know, you can't
avoid me all evening.

211
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:54,934
I... I said a dance, Phillip.

212
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:56,519
Not this one.

213
00:23:56,644 --> 00:23:59,230
I promised this one to...
- Francis Ouimet.

214
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:02,317
Do I know your family?
- I don't know.

215
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:04,319
Phillip Wainwright?
- Wainwright?

216
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:06,321
Oh, yes. Wainwrights,
good people.

217
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:07,614
Wainwrights.

218
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:15,205
Well, the evening's young.
She'll catch up with you.

219
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:23,004
You're a real sport for helping.

220
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:24,422
It's no trouble.

221
00:24:29,344 --> 00:24:30,929
I had the craziest day.

222
00:24:31,012 --> 00:24:35,225
I take a train from Philadelphia,
my bags end up in Baltimore.

223
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:38,019
My tux is in the bags
in Baltimore.

224
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:41,731
I'm wearing the houseman's suit.

225
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:46,819
I think you look just fine.

226
00:24:46,945 --> 00:24:48,821
You too.

227
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:52,909
Is he gone?

228
00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:56,204
No, he's still watching.

229
00:24:56,204 --> 00:24:57,914
Shall we dance?

230
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:15,807
You said you were
going to college?

231
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:18,017
Smith. First semester.

232
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:19,435
Oh.

233
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:21,938
Where are you going?

234
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:23,940
To college?

235
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,817
Oh, uh, um,

236
00:25:25,942 --> 00:25:29,112
I'm taking the year off
to consider my options.

237
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:32,407
I think that's so wise.

238
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:34,242
Perhaps you'll go to Europe.

239
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:37,537
Perhaps I will.
'Cause I have family in France.

240
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:42,625
I'm sorry. What did you
say your name was again?

241
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:45,211
Francis. Ouimet.

242
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:49,924
Oh, look!
There's my brother!

243
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:58,016
Freddie, you must know Francis.
- Freddie.

244
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:01,436
Caddie Boy.

245
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:03,521
Freddie, you're such a kidder.

246
00:26:05,523 --> 00:26:08,234
Dad, Mother, this is Francis Ouimet.

247
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:09,944
How do you do?

248
00:26:10,028 --> 00:26:11,905
That's a beautiful dress.

249
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:14,032
Francis is playing
in the tournament.

250
00:26:14,115 --> 00:26:15,909
Yes, yes, I know.

251
00:26:17,035 --> 00:26:20,622
Well, you boys chat.
Mother and I will be right back.

252
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:30,840
Swell girl, your daughter.

253
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:35,011
Young man, you may
have been invited,

254
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,514
but don't get the idea
that you belong here.

255
00:26:56,908 --> 00:26:59,118
There are only
two types of player:

256
00:26:59,244 --> 00:27:02,330
Those who keep their nerves
in control and win championships,

257
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:04,123
and those who do not.

258
00:28:38,009 --> 00:28:40,011
Five or less,
and you make the cut.

259
00:28:40,136 --> 00:28:43,515
Eighteen? I can make
five here in my sleep.

260
00:28:52,524 --> 00:28:54,943
That's the one.

261
00:29:57,213 --> 00:29:58,840
Congratulations.

262
00:29:58,923 --> 00:30:00,508
That's too bad, Caddie Boy.

263
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:02,719
You could caddie for me
in the tournament.

264
00:30:02,844 --> 00:30:05,305
You're available, right?

265
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:08,141
Congratulations, son.
Well played.

266
00:31:47,031 --> 00:31:48,616
Empire, Harry.

267
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:52,620
The sun never sets on us,
all that rubbish.

268
00:31:52,704 --> 00:31:56,916
Consider the glory that was Greece
of Alexander the Great.

269
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:59,544
Now you can't even
find it on a map.

270
00:32:00,712 --> 00:32:03,631
Greece
introduced sport to the world,

271
00:32:03,631 --> 00:32:06,509
pure expression
of their superiority.

272
00:32:06,634 --> 00:32:08,928
We've trodden that same road.

273
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:12,432
Football, cricket, rugby, golf.

274
00:32:12,515 --> 00:32:16,019
All the major championships
remain in British hands.

275
00:32:16,144 --> 00:32:17,437
Save one.

276
00:32:18,938 --> 00:32:21,232
What are you proposing?

277
00:32:21,316 --> 00:32:23,943
The U.S. Open.

278
00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:27,113
You won it before.

279
00:32:27,238 --> 00:32:29,616
I want you to mount
a new campaign

280
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:31,534
to do to the Americans

281
00:32:31,618 --> 00:32:34,537
what Alexander
did to the Persians.

282
00:32:35,538 --> 00:32:37,415
Lay waste to 'em.

283
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:41,336
My papers get exclusive coverage.

284
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:44,839
Bernard here comes along
to chronicle your conquest.

285
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:46,508
It's our game, man.

286
00:32:46,633 --> 00:32:50,428
Win their Open and
bring back that trophy.

287
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:54,224
You pocket
your winnings, of course.

288
00:32:54,307 --> 00:32:55,725
Hmm.

289
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:59,229
Wouldn't pay for the crossing, sir.
- All expenses paid.

290
00:32:59,312 --> 00:33:02,607
As part of an exhibition tour,
all sponsors arranged.

291
00:33:02,732 --> 00:33:04,442
Does that cover it?

292
00:33:08,029 --> 00:33:09,822
Yep. That'd do it.

293
00:33:09,906 --> 00:33:11,407
And I hear there's talk

294
00:33:11,533 --> 00:33:14,035
of an honorary
membership at the club.

295
00:33:14,118 --> 00:33:15,828
This would clinch it.

296
00:33:15,912 --> 00:33:19,123
And I daresay His Majesty
might want to show his gratitude

297
00:33:19,207 --> 00:33:21,209
to England's greatest sportsman.

298
00:33:21,334 --> 00:33:24,003
Harry Vardon,
Order of the British Empire.

299
00:33:24,128 --> 00:33:26,840
Has a nice ring to it.

300
00:33:30,844 --> 00:33:33,930
I'll need a partner.
Somebody to share the workload with.

301
00:33:34,013 --> 00:33:35,932
My thoughts exactly.

302
00:33:36,015 --> 00:33:38,935
Wilfred here is your man.
Top amateur in the British Isles.

303
00:33:39,018 --> 00:33:40,603
Delighted, old chap.

304
00:33:40,728 --> 00:33:42,730
Jolly good wheeze, what?

305
00:33:42,814 --> 00:33:45,942
Giving the Yanks
a thorough thrashing.

306
00:33:49,737 --> 00:33:52,740
I had someone else in mind.

307
00:33:56,244 --> 00:33:57,537
Ted Ray?

308
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,038
Christ, he's a Visigoth.

309
00:33:59,122 --> 00:34:00,540
No, he's a Jerseyman.

310
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:03,126
'Scuse me.

311
00:34:15,805 --> 00:34:17,515
All bets off!

312
00:34:27,025 --> 00:34:28,943
Come on!
- Come on!

313
00:34:38,828 --> 00:34:40,705
Ha ha ha ha ha!

314
00:34:42,707 --> 00:34:44,626
Ted!
- Harry!

315
00:34:44,709 --> 00:34:47,837
Hey! Look at you!

316
00:34:47,921 --> 00:34:51,424
What's this, another night out
with your ruling class masters?

317
00:34:51,424 --> 00:34:54,135
Ted Ray, Lord Northcliffe.

318
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:57,805
Lord Northcliffe?
The honor is entirely mine.

319
00:34:58,223 --> 00:35:00,934
Mmm!

320
00:35:02,018 --> 00:35:04,103
What brings you down
this way, Harry?

321
00:35:33,132 --> 00:35:35,927
Can you believe they moved
the Open back three months

322
00:35:35,927 --> 00:35:37,804
just so one guy can play in it?

323
00:35:37,929 --> 00:35:39,722
Well, he's Harry Vardon,

324
00:35:39,806 --> 00:35:41,641
The Stylist, The Greyhound.

325
00:35:41,724 --> 00:35:43,726
I don't care if he's
the man in the moon.

326
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:46,020
They wouldn't do that
for an American.

327
00:35:46,104 --> 00:35:48,106
Ask Francis.
He used to play.

328
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,235
You did?
- No, not really.

329
00:35:52,944 --> 00:35:54,737
Ah, he's being modest.

330
00:35:54,821 --> 00:35:56,906
He used to be good
before he gave it up

331
00:35:57,031 --> 00:35:59,826
for the glamour of retail.
Isn't that right, Francis?

332
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,413
Francis!

333
00:36:04,622 --> 00:36:05,915
Francis!

334
00:38:16,629 --> 00:38:20,842
Oh, well.
It was glorious.

335
00:38:20,925 --> 00:38:23,428
Wasn't it glorious?
- Yes, it was.

336
00:38:23,428 --> 00:38:25,930
Have you ever heard
such a voice?

337
00:38:28,516 --> 00:38:32,228
It was like the... the music
was coming through her

338
00:38:32,312 --> 00:38:34,522
from someplace else.

339
00:38:35,607 --> 00:38:38,318
That's the feeling
I've always wanted...

340
00:38:41,905 --> 00:38:45,033
Francis, for what? Hmm?

341
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:02,342
There he is.
Francis! Come here.

342
00:39:02,425 --> 00:39:03,635
Meet Robert Watson,

343
00:39:03,718 --> 00:39:06,513
president of the
United States Golf Association.

344
00:39:08,306 --> 00:39:10,141
Francis, pleasure.

345
00:39:10,225 --> 00:39:12,018
Well, the pleasure's mine, sir.

346
00:39:12,143 --> 00:39:14,604
Uh, let me have a salesman
show you our equipment.

347
00:39:14,729 --> 00:39:17,941
It's the best selection in Boston.
- He's not here to buy clubs.

348
00:39:18,024 --> 00:39:21,027
I hear you live in Brookline,
not far from the country club.

349
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,403
Right across the street.

350
00:39:22,529 --> 00:39:26,032
We're holding our Open Championship
there in two weeks.

351
00:39:26,032 --> 00:39:29,035
Your name came up.
- My name, sir?

352
00:39:29,118 --> 00:39:31,538
I'm looking to add
a local amateur to the field.

353
00:39:31,621 --> 00:39:34,207
Harry Vardon's playing.
And Ted Ray.

354
00:39:38,545 --> 00:39:43,925
Mr. Watson, thank you,
but I can't accept.

355
00:39:43,925 --> 00:39:46,427
Why not?
- I'm awfully busy here.

356
00:39:46,511 --> 00:39:50,014
And, uh, I don't
play golf anymore.

357
00:39:51,307 --> 00:39:54,143
How old are you, Francis?
- I'm 20, sir.

358
00:39:55,228 --> 00:39:58,106
Awfully young to be giving up
on your dreams, aren't you?

359
00:39:58,106 --> 00:40:00,525
I just have different ones now,
that's all.

360
00:40:02,527 --> 00:40:04,028
I'm sorry, Mr. Hastings.

361
00:40:04,112 --> 00:40:06,614
There's no need
to explain, Francis.

362
00:40:07,907 --> 00:40:09,325
All the best.

363
00:41:10,512 --> 00:41:12,430
That swing looks familiar.

364
00:41:12,514 --> 00:41:13,806
Hey!

365
00:41:13,932 --> 00:41:15,433
What are you doing here?

366
00:41:15,517 --> 00:41:18,019
Father's taking me out
for our annual round.

367
00:41:18,645 --> 00:41:20,730
My brother said that
you were working here.

368
00:41:20,813 --> 00:41:24,025
Your brother. I've seen him
in here a couple times.

369
00:41:25,109 --> 00:41:27,529
I was hoping you could
sell me some equipment.

370
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:30,323
I'm not actually the salesman.

371
00:41:31,324 --> 00:41:33,326
Still considering your options?

372
00:41:33,409 --> 00:41:34,911
Yeah.

373
00:41:39,541 --> 00:41:41,835
I'll go get you a salesman.

374
00:42:05,942 --> 00:42:07,527
All right.

375
00:42:14,742 --> 00:42:16,244
Harry Vardon.

376
00:42:16,327 --> 00:42:19,122
The Stylist.
Practice round.

377
00:42:25,837 --> 00:42:29,716
We're expecting a big turnout, so it's
important we have marshals here...

378
00:42:29,841 --> 00:42:31,217
Mr. Watson.
Francis Ouimet.

379
00:42:31,342 --> 00:42:33,845
Can I speak to you, sir?
- What is it?

380
00:42:33,928 --> 00:42:36,639
If that offer is still good,
I'd love to take you up on it.

381
00:42:36,723 --> 00:42:38,308
We have to think about that.

382
00:42:38,433 --> 00:42:41,436
I'm not asking for favors...
- Can you give us a moment?

383
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:43,104
What about Grove Street?

384
00:42:56,409 --> 00:42:58,536
Meet me here, sunup.

385
00:42:59,621 --> 00:43:01,331
You've got some work to do.

386
00:43:58,805 --> 00:44:01,307
Billy, where do we stand?

387
00:44:01,432 --> 00:44:03,142
Cut line's 76.

388
00:44:03,226 --> 00:44:05,228
Six holes to
make up four shots.

389
00:44:37,635 --> 00:44:39,804
What is it?
What's wrong?

390
00:44:39,929 --> 00:44:42,807
You just made six straight birdies.
- I did?

391
00:44:42,932 --> 00:44:45,935
Congratulations, lad.
You're in the Open.

392
00:44:54,819 --> 00:44:55,904
Gentlemen?

393
00:44:57,405 --> 00:45:00,408
I want to welcome you all,
professionals and amateurs alike,

394
00:45:00,533 --> 00:45:03,620
to the 18th United States
Open Championship.

395
00:45:09,417 --> 00:45:12,337
Four rounds of golf to be played
over the next two days

396
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:14,923
to identify the best
player in the world.

397
00:45:15,006 --> 00:45:17,008
Let's give a special welcome

398
00:45:17,133 --> 00:45:20,512
to the British Amateur Champion,
Mr. Wilfred Reid...

399
00:45:22,514 --> 00:45:24,933
...and our famous
professional visitors,

400
00:45:24,933 --> 00:45:26,809
Harry Vardon and Ted Ray.

401
00:45:31,022 --> 00:45:34,817
I'll yield the floor
to our defending champion,

402
00:45:34,943 --> 00:45:38,029
a professional from Philadelphia,
John McDermott.

403
00:45:48,206 --> 00:45:50,625
If you read the papers,
there's a lot of talk

404
00:45:50,708 --> 00:45:54,921
about the great English champions
sailing over here to play in our Open.

405
00:45:55,004 --> 00:45:57,131
As the only born American
to win this cup,

406
00:45:57,215 --> 00:45:59,634
I'd like to say
to you boys, welcome.

407
00:45:59,634 --> 00:46:02,011
We're happy to have you.
- Hear, hear.

408
00:46:02,136 --> 00:46:04,013
We know Harry Vardon
was winning Opens

409
00:46:04,138 --> 00:46:06,432
back when most of us
were learning our ABC's.

410
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:11,104
He's a genius in
the history of our game.

411
00:46:12,939 --> 00:46:16,109
Mr. Vardon, I know you won
this baby once before.

412
00:46:16,234 --> 00:46:18,736
I see your name here.

413
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:20,822
It's a long time ago,
by the look of it.

414
00:46:24,325 --> 00:46:27,704
Well, we hope you boys
have a nice time here in Boston.

415
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:30,707
Personally, I don't think you will.

416
00:46:30,832 --> 00:46:33,710
I don't care if you whupped us
the last six weeks.

417
00:46:33,835 --> 00:46:37,505
I'm tired of people saying all you
have to do to win is show up!

418
00:46:37,505 --> 00:46:40,508
This time you're not
taking our damn cup back!

419
00:46:46,306 --> 00:46:48,016
Might just have
to kill that one.

420
00:46:48,141 --> 00:46:50,143
Good luck, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

421
00:46:51,227 --> 00:46:52,729
Billy.

422
00:46:52,812 --> 00:46:54,939
See you first thing
tomorrow morning?

423
00:46:55,023 --> 00:46:57,025
I can't.
- Well, why not?

424
00:46:57,108 --> 00:47:00,236
This English fella offered me
20 bucks, 50 if he wins.

425
00:47:02,739 --> 00:47:05,742
Well, I can't give you
anything like that.

426
00:47:05,825 --> 00:47:08,828
I'm sorry, Francis.
I've got two kids at home.

427
00:47:15,919 --> 00:47:17,712
Mr. Campbell?
I just lost my caddie.

428
00:47:17,837 --> 00:47:19,339
Do you know somebody?

429
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:22,634
Sorry, all the lads are taken.
- What am I supposed to do?

430
00:47:22,717 --> 00:47:25,011
Hitch up your knickers.
You think Vardon and Ray

431
00:47:25,136 --> 00:47:27,430
will take pity because you
carry your own bag?

432
00:47:27,514 --> 00:47:30,308
This is the Open.
Every man for himself.

433
00:47:33,311 --> 00:47:34,729
What am I doing here?

434
00:47:38,107 --> 00:47:39,609
Hey, Francis!

435
00:47:39,734 --> 00:47:41,444
Jack! What are you doin' here?

436
00:47:41,528 --> 00:47:44,614
Me and Eddie hooked school
to come watch the practice round.

437
00:47:44,614 --> 00:47:46,908
Are you still caddying
out at Franklin Park?

438
00:47:47,033 --> 00:47:48,826
That's right.
- Any chance you can

439
00:47:48,826 --> 00:47:50,537
carry for me tomorrow?

440
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:52,330
In the Open?
- Yeah.

441
00:47:54,415 --> 00:47:56,543
Well, what happened to your guy?

442
00:47:56,543 --> 00:47:58,545
He got a better offer.

443
00:47:58,628 --> 00:48:00,630
Then that guy's
a big, fat jerk! What?

444
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,508
Jack, if you're gonna do this,

445
00:48:03,633 --> 00:48:06,344
you gotta be here
tomorrow at 7:30 sharp.

446
00:48:06,427 --> 00:48:07,512
Do it!

447
00:48:07,637 --> 00:48:09,722
Can Eddie come too?

448
00:48:09,806 --> 00:48:11,724
Jack, I can't change the rules.

449
00:48:11,808 --> 00:48:14,018
You're only allowed
one man on the bag.

450
00:48:20,024 --> 00:48:22,735
Maybe he could walk
with us and keep score.

451
00:48:22,819 --> 00:48:24,612
We'll figure it out.

452
00:48:24,737 --> 00:48:27,532
Is that OK with you?
- Sure.

453
00:48:27,615 --> 00:48:29,534
Francis, you got yourself a deal.

454
00:48:29,534 --> 00:48:31,411
That's great, Jack.
That's great.

455
00:48:31,411 --> 00:48:32,704
I'll see ya, Eddie.

456
00:48:37,208 --> 00:48:38,835
I'll get it, Henry!

457
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:43,631
And what do you want?

458
00:48:43,715 --> 00:48:46,134
I was hopin' to speak
to Sarah. Is she here?

459
00:48:46,217 --> 00:48:48,428
She left for college.

460
00:48:48,511 --> 00:48:51,306
When, today?
- Yeah.

461
00:48:53,641 --> 00:48:55,226
Give her a message for me.

462
00:48:58,104 --> 00:48:59,314
Who was that, Freddie?

463
00:48:59,439 --> 00:49:02,317
Ah, it was... it was no one.
It was a peddler.

464
00:49:02,442 --> 00:49:04,944
Did you hear about the caddie
playing in the Open?

465
00:49:05,028 --> 00:49:08,239
It should never have happened.
Reflects badly on all concerned.

466
00:49:08,323 --> 00:49:10,241
I say, if he wants
to go out and play

467
00:49:10,325 --> 00:49:12,911
and make a fool of himself again,
so much the better.

468
00:49:13,036 --> 00:49:16,039
Who are you talking about?
- It's a club matter.

469
00:49:16,039 --> 00:49:17,624
Caddie Boy.

470
00:49:17,707 --> 00:49:19,125
Ouimet.

471
00:49:19,209 --> 00:49:23,004
Insists he's an amateur.
What is the world coming to?

472
00:49:23,004 --> 00:49:26,424
More bisque, sir?
- Thank you, Henry.

473
00:49:26,508 --> 00:49:29,844
And what kind of pie does
Audrey have for us tonight?

474
00:49:29,844 --> 00:49:33,223
Huckleberry, sir.
- Ah. Splendid.

475
00:49:43,107 --> 00:49:45,527
Did you think you could
keep it from me?

476
00:49:47,111 --> 00:49:48,238
I didn't try to.

477
00:49:48,321 --> 00:49:51,741
Your name is in the newspaper,
sneaking around behind my back.

478
00:49:51,741 --> 00:49:53,326
No, no, no, Father...

479
00:49:53,409 --> 00:49:55,537
You're going to stop this now.

480
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:59,332
A man knows his place
and makes his peace with it.

481
00:49:59,415 --> 00:50:01,918
I can't talk about this.
- Then you listen.

482
00:50:03,044 --> 00:50:04,337
This is for your own good.

483
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:06,214
I am trying to protect you.

484
00:50:06,214 --> 00:50:07,841
Protect me from what?

485
00:50:07,924 --> 00:50:11,928
Francis, those men don't have
to earn a place in this world.

486
00:50:12,011 --> 00:50:13,513
It's given to them.

487
00:50:13,638 --> 00:50:16,516
We're not those kind of people.

488
00:50:16,641 --> 00:50:19,811
Now, you go tell them
that you can't do this.

489
00:50:19,811 --> 00:50:21,229
It's a mistake.

490
00:50:24,816 --> 00:50:26,442
I won't do that.

491
00:50:30,238 --> 00:50:32,240
You gave me your word.

492
00:50:33,825 --> 00:50:36,536
You gave me your word.

493
00:50:36,619 --> 00:50:38,538
I can't quit now. I'm sorry.

494
00:50:41,916 --> 00:50:44,919
Then so help me,
when this is over,

495
00:50:45,044 --> 00:50:48,214
you find somewhere else to live.

496
00:51:01,936 --> 00:51:03,313
Fine.

497
00:51:25,335 --> 00:51:27,712
Make sure these people
get the etiquette guide.

498
00:51:27,837 --> 00:51:30,423
Most of them have never been
on a golf course before.

499
00:51:30,507 --> 00:51:32,133
God help us.

500
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:34,719
Mr. Ouimet!

501
00:51:35,803 --> 00:51:36,804
Mr. Ouimet!

502
00:51:40,808 --> 00:51:42,644
Eddie!

503
00:51:42,727 --> 00:51:44,729
Where's Jack?
I tee off in ten minutes.

504
00:51:44,812 --> 00:51:46,940
Truant officer caught him.
He's in school.

505
00:51:47,023 --> 00:51:50,109
Why aren't you with him?
- Come on! This is the U.S. Open.

506
00:51:50,235 --> 00:51:51,819
Thanks for coming to tell me.

507
00:51:51,945 --> 00:51:54,739
Mr. Ouimet,
I can caddie for you.

508
00:51:54,822 --> 00:51:57,617
Eddie, my bag
is as big as you are.

509
00:51:57,617 --> 00:51:59,035
But I can do it!

510
00:51:59,118 --> 00:52:01,830
I carry for lots of fellas
at Franklin Park. Ask 'em.

511
00:52:01,913 --> 00:52:04,123
I came to make good
on what Jack promised.

512
00:52:04,207 --> 00:52:07,836
I hooked school, took three
streetcars and I am big enough!

513
00:52:07,836 --> 00:52:10,338
I'm in 5th grade,
and I want to caddie for you!

514
00:52:10,421 --> 00:52:12,215
Calm down for a second.

515
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:15,718
How about this? I'll carry my bag,
and you walk next to me.

516
00:52:15,718 --> 00:52:17,512
No, Mr. Ouimet!
- Call me Francis.

517
00:52:17,637 --> 00:52:19,514
I can do it, Mr. Ouimet.
- Francis.

518
00:52:19,639 --> 00:52:21,724
I know your game.
I've seen you play.

519
00:52:21,808 --> 00:52:24,227
I can carry that bag!
- All right. All right.

520
00:52:24,310 --> 00:52:28,606
You can caddie for me. OK? But you're
gonna have to call me Francis.

521
00:52:28,731 --> 00:52:31,317
OK, Francis.
- All right.

522
00:52:35,822 --> 00:52:37,907
You got a problem?

523
00:52:38,032 --> 00:52:40,326
This is
the 9:45 tee time.

524
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:42,829
The professional from
Cattawaukee Golf Club,

525
00:52:42,912 --> 00:52:44,414
Albert Murray.

526
00:52:49,836 --> 00:52:51,629
From Brookline, Massachusetts,

527
00:52:51,713 --> 00:52:54,215
amateur Mr. Francis Ouimet.

528
00:53:48,144 --> 00:53:49,938
Whatever you decide, Francis,

529
00:53:50,021 --> 00:53:52,232
keep your head down
and I'll watch the ball.

530
00:53:52,315 --> 00:53:54,025
We're gonna par this hole.

531
00:54:15,922 --> 00:54:18,508
That's the stuff.
One shot at a time.

532
00:54:34,232 --> 00:54:36,734
One putt, we'll get that par.

533
00:54:36,734 --> 00:54:38,528
Nice and steady now.

534
00:54:38,611 --> 00:54:40,613
Make it roll,
it'll seek the hole.

535
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,842
Easy peazy, lemon squeezy.

536
00:55:54,229 --> 00:55:56,231
He's not supposed to miss those.

537
00:55:56,231 --> 00:55:57,607
Third one this morning.

538
00:55:57,732 --> 00:56:00,443
What the devil's wrong with him?

539
00:56:01,444 --> 00:56:02,820
I'm sure I don't know, sir.

540
00:56:49,742 --> 00:56:52,620
It's in the bleedin' trees,
you great bunch o' ninnies.

541
00:56:53,413 --> 00:56:56,040
Ted! Rotten luck, old boy!

542
00:56:56,124 --> 00:56:59,836
Just one of those days, what?
- Still a lot of golf to play yet!

543
00:57:01,504 --> 00:57:03,339
Toffee-nosed git.

544
00:57:13,016 --> 00:57:15,643
There are only
two types of player:

545
00:57:15,727 --> 00:57:18,938
Those who keep their nerves in
control and win championships,

546
00:57:19,022 --> 00:57:20,440
and those who do not.

547
00:57:43,713 --> 00:57:47,842
Hey, Francis,
who's that big, fat guy?

548
00:57:49,427 --> 00:57:52,514
Oh, my gosh.
It's President Taft.

549
00:57:52,514 --> 00:57:55,225
Get out!
President Taft?

550
00:57:55,308 --> 00:57:57,810
The United States
President Taft?

551
00:57:57,936 --> 00:58:01,022
You ever seen a president before?
- First time.

552
00:58:01,105 --> 00:58:03,441
Hey! How you doin' there,
Mr. President?

553
00:58:07,028 --> 00:58:10,615
Francis! Did you just
birdie your last hole?

554
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:12,408
I guess I did, Frank.

555
00:58:12,534 --> 00:58:15,036
Holy smokes, Francis,
you're tied with Vardon.

556
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:17,413
You're in second place.
- I am?

557
00:58:17,539 --> 00:58:21,334
President Taft is talking
about you. President Taft.

558
00:58:21,334 --> 00:58:22,710
Isn't it incredible?

559
00:58:22,836 --> 00:58:24,838
OK, we're working here, buddy.

560
00:58:24,921 --> 00:58:26,339
Don't listen to him.

561
00:58:26,422 --> 00:58:29,133
We play our game, let those
guys worry about theirs.

562
00:58:32,011 --> 00:58:33,429
I'm tied...

563
00:58:42,522 --> 00:58:46,609
You're tied
with Vardon. You're in second place.

564
00:58:56,744 --> 00:58:58,413
Oh, God.

565
00:59:35,617 --> 00:59:37,619
Thanks for nothin'.

566
01:00:03,728 --> 01:00:05,813
We gotta settle down now, Francis.

567
01:00:05,813 --> 01:00:07,941
Oh, yeah?
How are we gonna do that?

568
01:00:09,442 --> 01:00:11,444
You're just gonna
have to play better.

569
01:00:13,404 --> 01:00:14,906
Keep your head down.

570
01:00:37,804 --> 01:00:38,805
Whew.

571
01:00:56,614 --> 01:00:58,116
All right, gimme the mashie.

572
01:00:58,241 --> 01:00:59,909
You're not gonna
reach with that.

573
01:01:00,034 --> 01:01:01,327
If he can, I can.

574
01:01:27,812 --> 01:01:30,315
In round two,
Harry Vardon's pulled even

575
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:32,942
with the defending champion,
John McDermott,

576
01:01:33,026 --> 01:01:37,614
but Mr. Wilfred Reid
is matching him shot for shot.

577
01:01:37,739 --> 01:01:39,741
After a poor showing
this morning,

578
01:01:39,824 --> 01:01:42,744
Ted Ray's stalking the grounds
like a mad brute.

579
01:01:42,827 --> 01:01:45,413
He... Mad brute.

580
01:01:46,206 --> 01:01:49,417
He may yet have something
to say about this championship.

581
01:01:59,511 --> 01:02:01,137
Quiet.

582
01:02:14,317 --> 01:02:15,610
Go, go, go, go!

583
01:02:15,735 --> 01:02:16,736
Get in there.

584
01:02:22,742 --> 01:02:24,035
Blimey.

585
01:02:24,118 --> 01:02:26,830
They're easily entertained.

586
01:02:26,913 --> 01:02:28,623
I'm counting on you, old boy,

587
01:02:28,706 --> 01:02:31,209
if Vardon and that great ape
of his can't deliver.

588
01:02:31,334 --> 01:02:33,336
Quite. All for England.

589
01:02:33,419 --> 01:02:36,130
Save that patriotic gibberish
for the newspapers.

590
01:02:36,214 --> 01:02:39,008
The prime minister has promised me
a seat in his cabinet

591
01:02:39,133 --> 01:02:40,510
if I bring back this trophy.

592
01:02:40,635 --> 01:02:43,638
And rest assured, Wilfred,
you will be remembered.

593
01:02:45,223 --> 01:02:46,933
Ah. Bravo, Harry.

594
01:02:47,016 --> 01:02:48,726
You're tied with me for the lead.

595
01:02:48,810 --> 01:02:52,730
Very well played, sir.
- All for King and country, what?

596
01:02:52,814 --> 01:02:56,109
Wilfred played splendidly,
more than can be said for your man Ray.

597
01:02:56,234 --> 01:02:57,527
Wild as a Hottentot.
