- You served him coffee in a diner a couple of times.

- His arms are scarred.
- Yeah, that's him.

912

He always ate pecan pie with his coffee.
I remember that.

- No.

918

I had the strangest feeling
about him.

- What's wrong with him?

924
01:07:08,959 --> 01:07:10,859
He's going to kill himself.

925

Why?

926
01:07:12,796 --> 01:07:16,323

That's my guess anyway.

I could do to help.
