those two astronauts to the Moon

00:31:22,202 --> 00:31:23,575
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">I'm coming.</font></font>

304
00:31:26,743 --> 00:31:28,971
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">Looks very good!</font></font>

305
00:31:30,528 --> 00:31:33,221
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">And now we just...</font></font>

306
00:31:44,389 --> 00:31:46,054
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">Why don't you take me with you?</font></font>

307
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,427
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">-Don't worry, darling.</font></font>

308
00:31:48,507 --> 00:31:51,013
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">After I've completed my mission,
I'll come and get you.</font></font>

309
00:31:51,646 --> 00:31:54,596
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">That's not what I mean.
I study the Earth!</font></font>

310
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:58,478
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">I know everything about it.
You need me.</font></font>

311
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:03,022
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">You sweet little thing, where do you
get all those crazy ideas?</font></font>

312
00:32:04,604 --> 00:32:06,796
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">From... from books, mostly.</font></font>

313
00:32:07,348 --> 00:32:09,096
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">Sometimes from films.</font></font>

314
00:32:21,966 --> 00:32:24,013
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">I shall return as a hero.</font></font>

315
00:32:44,601 --> 00:32:47,601
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">Heil Hitler!
- Heil Kortzfleisch!</font></font>

316
00:32:47,681 --> 00:32:51,116
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">Won't you ever learn?
- But of course, my Führer.</font></font>

317
00:32:52,459 --> 00:32:55,096
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">We have one more ace up our sleeve.</font></font>

318
00:32:59,715 --> 00:33:01,138
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">Show him what we have.</font></font>

319
00:33:09,883 --> 00:33:13,851
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">Voilá, gentlemen!
Doctor.</font></font>

320
00:33:15,029 --> 00:33:17,645
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">Watch closely, gentlemen.</font></font>

321
00:33:20,787 --> 00:33:21,688
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">Heil!</font></font>

322
00:33:32,715 --> 00:33:34,532
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">Stand up, you fool.</font></font>

323
00:33:39,015 --> 00:33:40,208
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">Sieg Heil!</font></font>

324
00:33:51,457 --> 00:33:54,898
With the prisoner now being one of us,
we will go down to Earth.

325
00:33:54,978 --> 00:33:58,003
He will help us to find
more telephone computers.

326
00:33:58,083 --> 00:34:02,403
We return, and get the
Götterdämmerung flying.

327
00:34:02,856 --> 00:34:09,690
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">Oberführer Adler, I hope you've
discussed my return to the Earth.</font></font>

328
00:34:10,592 --> 00:34:16,668
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">- This is the order, yes.
- The Reich trusts you.</font></font>

329
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:23,454
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">Thank you, Doctor.
Take care of your daughter for me.</font></font>

330
00:34:47,174 --> 00:34:49,491
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">See you in Valhalla.</font></font>

331
00:35:44,619 --> 00:35:48,378
- You smell that?
- No. We don’t have time to waste.

332
00:35:49,739 --> 00:35:51,520
Take me to that president of yours.

333
00:35:52,264 --> 00:35:54,565
What? The President?

334
00:35:55,814 --> 00:35:58,922
Come on man, I thought you want me to
take you to the Mac store or something.

335
00:36:01,771 --> 00:36:07,832
You said that you would know the President
of these United States of the Americas.

336
00:36:07,912 --> 00:36:10,065
Right, of course.

337
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,712
That President.

338
00:36:20,464 --> 00:36:23,183
May I meet this President too?

339
00:36:23,938 --> 00:36:26,393
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">Renate! What are you doing here?</font></font>

340
00:36:27,184 --> 00:36:31,061
Hey! Miss Richter! Welcome to my planet.

341
00:36:31,418 --> 00:36:35,386
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">This is not the place for the mother of
the children of the future Führer.</font></font>

342
00:36:35,466 --> 00:36:37,699
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">And definitely
not the place for a woman.</font></font>

343
00:36:43,528 --> 00:36:45,846
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">My place is by my man.</font></font>

344
00:36:51,353 --> 00:36:54,176
- Get the hell outta my property.
- You better get outta here.

345
00:36:57,658 --> 00:36:58,837
Run for it!

346
00:37:24,628 --> 00:37:26,113
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">Stop the vehicle.</font></font>

347
00:37:38,021 --> 00:37:41,265
Change of plans.
We walk.

348
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:47,962
Sounds good, man.

349
00:38:08,918 --> 00:38:11,430
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">Ah! A small bus.</font></font>

350
00:38:13,528 --> 00:38:16,312
Whoa-whoa-whoa...
Now hold on here, Boss man

351
00:38:16,392 --> 00:38:19,751
That may not be the sharpest move.
Look, look, I'll tell you what.

352
00:38:19,987 --> 00:38:24,735
Let me go talk to those guys, all right?
They know me, you know, I'm one of them

353
00:38:24,947 --> 00:38:25,879
Are you with me?

354
00:38:27,871 --> 00:38:31,098
Yeah, now - now you're talking.
Alright...

355
00:38:31,781 --> 00:38:32,762
Now...

356
00:38:38,897 --> 00:38:42,504
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">Doesn't he know?
- No. He'll be thrilled.</font></font>

357
00:38:42,584 --> 00:38:46,217
Now seriously, how I am
glad to see you all, man.

358
00:38:46,466 --> 00:38:52,251
Looks like small Africa part in this [...] Oh,
people, you all know me, huh? I love you too!

359
00:38:53,315 --> 00:38:54,476
-Washington!

360
00:38:57,892 --> 00:39:02,029
That ain't one of yours, is it? Because I... Um,
look, man, you ain't got to bring this shit out.

361
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:06,364
Hey, this all good. Look, I'm a peace-loving
brother, man... fuck it, man! Go! Go!

362
00:39:13,681 --> 00:39:17,834
- Are you alright?
- Do I fucking look alright to you, miss crazy fucking Nazi?

363
00:39:17,954 --> 00:39:21,294
Ah... I mean..
What the hell just happened?

364
00:39:21,414 --> 00:39:24,853
You know... Okay, I may be not one
of the right fellas, but I mean - Geez!

365
00:39:24,933 --> 00:39:30,516
A-and then they started calling me white! I mean,
why in the fuck would they be calling me white?

366
00:39:36,551 --> 00:39:40,827
On, no mother-f WAY!!

367
00:39:48,378 --> 00:39:50,514
What did you sick sons-of-bitches do to me?

368
00:39:50,594 --> 00:39:54,266
- I should've told you - What? That
I look like a fucking polar bear?

369
00:39:55,517 --> 00:39:59,222
You know what: you two really, REALLY know,
how to fuck up a guy's Christmas!

370
00:39:59,302 --> 00:40:02,808
Quiet, YOU FOOL! What is wrong with you!

371
00:40:03,314 --> 00:40:06,214
We made you Aryan, you are one of us now

372
00:40:06,294 --> 00:40:08,932
- You should be thanking us
- Thanking you?

373
00:40:09,185 --> 00:40:12,948
What I should have done is let those
brothers come here with a size 15s

374
00:40:13,028 --> 00:40:16,906
put those foot so far up your ass that you
can taste the toe nail for 2 fucking weeks

375
00:40:16,986 --> 00:40:18,308
Klaus!!

376
00:40:24,293 --> 00:40:25,566
Bring me to your leader

377
00:40:25,804 --> 00:40:27,885
James... Washington.

378
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:34,570
Yeah... yeah. You got it!

379
00:40:45,347 --> 00:40:47,622
I am telling you once again..

380
00:40:48,273 --> 00:40:50,628
One moment we receive confirmation

381
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:53,532
that the ship has landed
successfully on the Moon

382
00:40:53,827 --> 00:40:56,374
Then next, all communication stopped

383
00:40:56,757 --> 00:41:00,475
- The signal simply vanished
- Or you're hiding something from us?

384
00:41:00,701 --> 00:41:03,908
Yeah, we are hiding something on
the dark side of the Moon

385
00:41:06,073 --> 00:41:11,605
I still find it very difficult to believe
that entire purpose of the mission

386
00:41:11,685 --> 00:41:15,838
was to promote your President's re-election

387
00:41:15,918 --> 00:41:18,604
Well believe what you like, we had
mere senators

388
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:23,126
spend hundreds of millions on campaigns
to get elected to dog-shit-posts.

389
00:41:23,503 --> 00:41:29,200
But Mr Secretary, the expenses involved this time
only make sense if there was a military purpose.

390
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,332
Okay, lets get this clear

391
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:36,372
The United States has no
military activity on the Moon

392
00:41:36,589 --> 00:41:38,947
What about natural resources activity?

393
00:41:39,177 --> 00:41:42,155
We know how the US sometimes
mixes them two up

394
00:41:43,123 --> 00:41:46,343
- Is there any chance that you are
looking for Helium 3 up there?

395
00:41:46,541 --> 00:41:50,278
Helium... 3...? You just
made that up didn't you?

396
00:41:52,085 --> 00:41:53,447
That's so silly

397
00:42:13,445 --> 00:42:16,442
I assume these are just preliminary ideas?

398
00:42:16,678 --> 00:42:20,559
Sir... we have a very small delivery window

399
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:22,048
- Sir?
- Yes, sir.

400
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:26,497
Ma'am, and... this is all.

401
00:42:36,492 --> 00:42:41,331
Anyone who is not head of the
department... should leave

402
00:42:50,315 --> 00:42:52,158
You IDIOTS!

403
00:42:52,708 --> 00:42:57,302
You morons!
That's an insult to morons

404
00:42:58,228 --> 00:43:01,124
What is this SHIT?!

405
00:43:01,976 --> 00:43:08,777
I have a meeting with the President
of the United FUCKING States of America.

406
00:43:08,857 --> 00:43:10,631
Tomorrow fucking morning

407
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,116
Not the President of fucking Zambia!

408
00:43:14,196 --> 00:43:17,221
Not the President of
the fucking Janitor's Union!

409
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:23,710
But the President of the fucking country <i>in which
we happen to all live above the third world!</i>

410
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:26,207
You peaces of hilacious SHIT!!

411
00:43:31,485 --> 00:43:33,030
What am I suppose to tell her?

412
00:43:36,297 --> 00:43:40,472
That my employees...
are not intelligent enough

413
00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:44,086
to be fucking morons?

414
00:43:45,917 --> 00:43:47,221
That's beautiful.

415
00:43:54,644 --> 00:43:57,978
I am stepping out to buy a knife.

416
00:43:58,386 --> 00:44:02,576
And when I step back in,
I expect to hear something...

417
00:44:03,274 --> 00:44:05,441
that is going to get me more happy

418
00:44:05,521 --> 00:44:07,404
that a G-spot orgasm.

419
00:44:09,602 --> 00:44:13,027
Or I will stab you all to death.

420
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,437
With my new knife.

421
00:44:19,802 --> 00:44:21,939
I'm not kidding.

422
00:44:33,022 --> 00:44:35,783
Hey, what the fuck?
Excuse me.

423
00:44:36,171 --> 00:44:39,199
Get your fuckin' hands off me,
you mother...

424
00:44:40,694 --> 00:44:43,510
- Is she your boss?
- Yeah, she's the big cheese.

425
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:46,257
- And she knows the president?
- Oh yeah, yeah. They real tight.

426
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:53,199
<i>You motherfucker!...fuck you...</i>
Oh, come on.

427
00:44:54,799 --> 00:44:59,159
<i>You fuckin' animal.
Do you know who I am?</i> Huh? Do you?

428
00:44:59,381 --> 00:45:02,751
You just kidnapped the wrong woman.
The wrong fucking woman.

429
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,199
Oh yeah. I hope your having a good time.
I'm gonna kick your fuckin' ass!

430
00:45:19,899 --> 00:45:21,699
Excellent.

431
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:24,552
My turn.

432
00:45:24,885 --> 00:45:28,607
I am Commander Klaus Adler of the 4th
Reich. We are based on the moon.

433
00:45:29,245 --> 00:45:32,899
I'm told you know the president of
these United States of the Americas.

434
00:45:32,979 --> 00:45:35,557
You will take us to that
President, because...

435
00:45:35,821 --> 00:45:39,049
- I have a very special present for him.
- Him?

436
00:45:39,659 --> 00:45:42,499
Well he'll loved that.
He just loves presents.

437
00:45:42,579 --> 00:45:44,542
As soon as my mission is accomplished.

438
00:45:44,622 --> 00:45:47,999
The Nazi invading forces will be
called in under my directions

439
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:51,375
and we will end the good times
for the bad people.

440
00:45:51,455 --> 00:45:53,345
And just how do you propose to do that?

441
00:45:54,621 --> 00:45:57,493
- We'll simply eliminate them.
- What?

442
00:45:59,211 --> 00:46:03,013
- Sorry, that is not what we are told.
- Renate, I don't think that you...

443
00:46:09,445 --> 00:46:11,804
Yeah. Why not?

444
00:46:12,039 --> 00:46:16,782
Why don't you tell you this fräulein why we're
here. Just like you keep telling your pupils.

445
00:46:17,628 --> 00:46:19,570
I would love to do that.

446
00:46:20,397 --> 00:46:21,445
You see...

447
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:25,288
the National Socialist Party is
the people's party, nothing more.

448
00:46:26,015 --> 00:46:31,397
We wish to return to Earth with
our message of peace and unity,

449
00:46:31,597 --> 00:46:33,279
love through virtue

450
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,497
and kindness, for example.

451
00:46:37,897 --> 00:46:41,549
We are healthy,
in mind and body.

452
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:46,097
Our spirits are brave and true.

453
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:51,526
And we achieve because we are strong,
and disciplined in our cause.

454
00:46:52,906 --> 00:46:55,320
There's simply no belief
that can match ours.

455
00:46:55,997 --> 00:47:01,487
Because peace and unity is the gift
we bring to all mankind.

456
00:47:03,497 --> 00:47:07,533
- What you and all earthlings need to know...
- Yeah, yeah. I get it, Hedwig.

457
00:47:10,805 --> 00:47:12,289
This is good.

458
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:15,792
This is gonna work.

459
00:47:17,397 --> 00:47:19,864
You, I need.

460
00:47:21,408 --> 00:47:23,497
And you...

461
00:47:24,197 --> 00:47:26,197
I want.

462
00:47:26,497 --> 00:47:30,297
Alright, let's go meet the President.

463
00:47:51,897 --> 00:47:53,725
Madam President...

464
00:47:54,797 --> 00:47:57,597
Here is the miracle
you asked for.

465
00:48:17,297 --> 00:48:21,180
- Who is this man?
- He will lead the campaign troops.

466
00:48:30,497 --> 00:48:33,513
Renate, please...

467
00:48:38,552 --> 00:48:40,597
This is very simple.

468
00:48:41,197 --> 00:48:42,897
The world is sick...

469
00:48:43,772 --> 00:48:46,297
but we are the doctors.

470
00:48:46,734 --> 00:48:51,097
The world is anemic,
and we are the vitamin.

471
00:48:51,177 --> 00:48:54,797
The world is weary,
but we are the strength.

472
00:48:55,162 --> 00:48:58,997
We are here
to make the world healthy once again.

473
00:48:59,197 --> 00:49:01,070
With hard work...

474
00:49:01,538 --> 00:49:06,060
with honesty, with clarity,
with decency.

475
00:49:07,297 --> 00:49:14,997
We are the product of loving
mothers and brave fathers.

476
00:49:15,765 --> 00:49:21,197
We are the embodiment
of love and bravery.

477
00:49:21,497 --> 00:49:27,092
We are the gift of both
God and science.

478
00:49:27,497 --> 00:49:31,097
We are the answer to the question.

479
00:49:31,573 --> 00:49:36,397
We are the promise
delivered to all mankind.

480
00:49:37,197 --> 00:49:41,397
For that we raise our hand,
to one nation.

481
00:49:41,702 --> 00:49:43,897
We step to the beat of one drum

482
00:49:44,097 --> 00:49:48,297
of this world.

483
00:49:48,506 --> 00:49:52,165
We are the people with the
children on our shoulders.

484
00:49:52,245 --> 00:49:57,397
In the same way as our fathers
carried us and their fathers before them.

485
00:49:57,797 --> 00:50:01,797
We are the one people,
united and strong.

486
00:50:01,997 --> 00:50:07,597
We are the one people with certainty.
Moral certainty.

487
00:50:07,677 --> 00:50:12,060
We are invincible
and we have no fear.

488
00:50:13,588 --> 00:50:19,123
Because the truth makes us ONES!!

00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:43,113
Look, I've been there.
I'm telling you.

523
00:54:43,193 --> 00:54:48,144
They got this whole moon base, they got this whole like
space thing goin' on, and they comin' to take over.

00:54:48,224 --> 00:54:51,848
Oh, you never listen to this right?

00:54:51,928 --> 00:54:57,171
They coming to get us all. Why ain't

526
00:54:59,885 --> 00:55:00,994
Renate.

527
00:55:01,744 --> 00:55:04,157
Washington.
James Washington.

528
00:55:04,237 --> 00:55:07,371
I'm so glad to see you alive.

529
00:55:07,451 --> 00:55:10,999
Look, I got one. This the bitch that
made me white as a fuckin' snowflake.

530
00:55:11,079 --> 00:55:13,002
Come on people, HELP ME!! Uh!

531
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:25,429
Help me!

532
00:55:26,358 --> 00:55:29,189
I saved your life!

533
00:55:32,397 --> 00:55:37,297
So, you are a formerly dead, black model...

534
00:55:37,553 --> 00:55:40,883
who's now suddenly
a living white hobo...

535
00:55:41,497 --> 00:55:45,297
after spending a weekend
on the Moon. Is that correct?

536
00:55:45,597 --> 00:55:48,597
- Yes, that's correct.
- Huh. So I was listening.

537
00:55:49,527 --> 00:55:55,497
And ah you, are Neil Armstrong after the
sex change operation. Is this correct?

538
00:55:55,831 --> 00:55:59,133
No, that is not correct.
You were not listening at all.

539
00:55:59,697 --> 00:56:02,197
My name is Richter.
Renate Richter.

540
00:56:02,277 --> 00:56:07,397
And I tried to save this man life and I
think he's stupid, childish and ungrateful.

541
00:56:07,666 --> 00:56:12,427
Okay. Ask Miss Moon-Nazi here, was I,
or was I not, on the Dark side of the Moon.

542
00:56:14,955 --> 00:56:22,955
Okay. So his question for you is: was he, or
was he not, on the Dark side of the Moon?

543
00:56:25,585 --> 00:56:29,088
Yes, Mr. Washington, James Washington
was on the Dark side of the Moon.

544
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:31,497
There. What did I tell you?

545
00:56:31,597 --> 00:56:36,297
I am black, but now I'm white. I went to the
Dark side of the Moon, but I'm now back.

546
00:56:36,377 --> 00:56:38,997
And the Nazis are coming to kill us all.

547
00:56:39,353 --> 00:56:43,598
And you guys are going to be so sorry
that you didn't listened to me!

548
00:56:46,897 --> 00:56:52,204
Mr. Washington James.
Why are you so upset and so angry?

549
00:56:52,284 --> 00:56:55,404
- Get lost.
- But I do not understand.

550
00:56:55,484 --> 00:56:57,597
I mean, we made you white.

551
00:56:58,089 --> 00:57:01,644
We taught you the National Socialist
message about peace and unity.

552
00:57:01,724 --> 00:57:04,897
You people have robbed me of everything.

553
00:57:05,569 --> 00:57:07,897
My-my race, my identity, my career.

554
00:57:08,325 --> 00:57:11,585
And I'm beginning to think my flippin'
mind too. I mean just everything.

555
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:14,697
Do you know this?

556
00:57:16,068 --> 00:57:16,914
Yes.

558
00:57:21,492 --> 00:57:24,997
Come on in. I will explain it to you.
Then you will understand.

559
00:57:27,745 --> 00:57:31,197
You are one strange broad.
I will give you that.

560
00:57:32,002 --> 00:57:33,875
Oh you know you're buyin' popcorn, right?

561
00:57:40,321 --> 00:57:42,497
Man, that was bullshit.

562
00:57:50,249 --> 00:57:51,797
It was...

563
00:57:52,889 --> 00:57:57,509
- It was so long.
- Yeah. They coulda edited it down a bit.

564
00:57:59,065 --> 00:58:00,997
He was mocking the Führer.

565
00:58:01,439 --> 00:58:04,547
I'm getting a sense there's a lot
about Nazis you don't know.

566
00:58:05,497 --> 00:58:07,121
- But I am a Nazi.

567
00:58:07,201 --> 00:58:09,597
- Oh yeah, yeah, I know,
I mean - but you're not like...

568
00:58:09,797 --> 00:58:14,468
Well, I mean, you know... like them.
A bunch of stupid bullies.

569
00:58:15,753 --> 00:58:18,897
No, I'm sure, they're good boys.

570
00:58:19,097 --> 00:58:21,117
And loyal to the Reich,
and their mothers.

571
00:58:21,847 --> 00:58:24,397
Look, they are wearing the symbol of love.

572
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,586
- The swastika?
- Yeah.

573
00:58:27,297 --> 00:58:29,297
Never heard it called that before.

574
00:58:29,497 --> 00:58:32,697
No, no.
No, no no no no. You just...

575
00:58:39,397 --> 00:58:43,397
What we got here, blond hair,
blue eyes, nice rack.

576
00:58:43,497 --> 00:58:45,886
Even Hitler would get a hard-on.

577
00:58:47,197 --> 00:58:52,017
- Look, I got this. Look, guys, we don't want any trouble.
- Why don't you get lost hobo.

578
00:58:52,097 --> 00:58:54,297
- Look, I got the funniest story to
tell you. Your not gonna believe this..

579
00:58:54,597 --> 00:58:56,297
- Stop that, that is enough.

580
00:59:02,871 --> 00:59:03,918
<i>Oh God!</i>

581
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,404
Boom!

582
00:59:17,458 --> 00:59:18,857
Damn, Renate.

583
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:23,152
Is that what you teach
in Eartology classes?

584
00:59:28,205 --> 00:59:30,424
Earthologie...

585
00:59:32,006 --> 00:59:34,373
I'm not Earthologist.

586
00:59:37,772 --> 00:59:39,894
I don't know anything about Earth.

587
00:59:41,068 --> 00:59:43,582
I have to talk to Klaus.

588
00:59:46,451 --> 00:59:48,900
(mumbles something)

589
00:59:49,612 --> 00:59:52,336
Yeah... That's what I thought.

590
00:59:52,793 --> 00:59:54,250
Hey Renate, wait up!

591
00:59:54,574 --> 00:59:56,599
What she needs is a good war.

592
00:59:57,441 --> 01:00:00,097
A war always make the president popular.

593
01:00:00,903 --> 01:00:04,797
Well, I might be able
to help her out there.

594
01:00:06,905 --> 01:00:08,397
How do you mean?

595
01:00:09,147 --> 01:00:12,518
One word from me, and the
invasion from the Moon begins.

596
01:00:17,528 --> 01:00:20,597
- You never break character do you?
- No.

597
01:00:22,199 --> 01:00:23,897
I can never be broken.

598
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:27,797
- You smell so good.
- The time has come.

599
01:00:30,419 --> 01:00:32,517
I show you my plans.

600
01:00:32,924 --> 01:00:35,172
Come back here.

601
01:00:43,497 --> 01:00:47,306
Look, look.
I've mapped out some things.

602
01:00:47,386 --> 01:00:50,602
Oh big fella.
All work and no play?

603
01:00:57,028 --> 01:01:00,617
Now listen, do you think
if I asphyxiate the President...

604
01:01:00,697 --> 01:01:02,831
will the troops stand in line with us?

605
01:01:06,122 --> 01:01:08,897
That's when I will order the moon invasion.

606
01:01:08,977 --> 01:01:11,997
It will be choirless bloodshed.

607
01:01:13,511 --> 01:01:16,797
After I eliminate the
moon Führer, of course.

608
01:01:27,497 --> 01:01:30,997
Klaus... Adler...

611
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:52,197
Um... so, Klaus, is the clown joining us?

612
01:01:53,661 --> 01:01:55,367
What, did you all buy tickets?

613
01:01:59,386 --> 01:02:02,549
Okay, so, do you want to
introduce me to your friends.

614
01:02:03,597 --> 01:02:07,197
Get your hooks off me
you crystal noob piece-of-shit.

615
01:02:08,275 --> 01:02:10,697
I can make this worth your while.
Just please, let me go.

616
01:02:11,258 --> 01:02:14,987
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">- Do it, Moon Corporal.</font></font>
- Don't shoot!

617
01:02:25,690 --> 01:02:31,683
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">And you want to eliminate
the Moon Führer.</font></font>

618
01:02:36,174 --> 01:02:40,173
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">Do you know
the penalty for treason?</font></font>

619
01:03:09,466 --> 01:03:12,776
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">The fleet is ready, my Führer.
- Excellent.</font></font>

620
01:03:13,758 --> 01:03:16,215
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">Tell them to wait for my return.</font></font>

621
01:03:16,676 --> 01:03:22,340
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">We shall then begin
the Meteorblitzkrieg.</font></font>

622
01:03:22,608 --> 01:03:30,500
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">We'll wipe all these sub-humans
off the Earth map.</font></font>

623
01:03:31,902 --> 01:03:33,386
KLAUS!!

624
01:03:42,797 --> 01:03:46,697
I need to tell you that I have
nothing to do with you or your plans.

625
01:03:47,377 --> 01:03:49,397
You Nazi piece-of-shit.

626
01:03:53,466 --> 01:03:55,303
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">Oh well.
A blessing in disguise.</font></font>

627
01:03:55,383 --> 01:03:59,048
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">Now I can kill all the enemies of
the Reich in one stroke.</font></font>

628
01:04:02,174 --> 01:04:05,298
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">Farewell, puppet Führer.</font></font>

629
01:04:42,043 --> 01:04:44,652
He fell for the old
'one last blow job' offer.

630
01:04:47,097 --> 01:04:49,497
God, Nazis are stupid.

631
01:04:50,466 --> 01:04:52,897
I commend you on your marksmanship.

632
01:04:57,997 --> 01:05:02,897
Shame. She was such a nice girl.
Just have to kill her later.

633
01:05:04,397 --> 01:05:06,042
So, it was real?

634
01:05:06,754 --> 01:05:10,971
- All this time.
- Never doubt a Nazi, <i>schöne Frau</i>.

635
01:05:19,097 --> 01:05:21,897
Farwell, fashionista.

636
01:05:23,097 --> 01:05:25,797
I have a planet to conquer!

637
01:05:52,396 --> 01:05:54,172
I'll just...

638
01:05:55,762 --> 01:05:57,344
grab this.

639
01:05:58,041 --> 01:05:59,997
Bye.

640
01:06:01,494 --> 01:06:03,797
Good luck with the rest of your life.

641
01:06:05,497 --> 01:06:08,108
Un... be... fuckin... lievable.

642
01:06:12,633 --> 01:06:15,298
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">They develop like ordinary women.
But look.</font></font>

643
01:06:15,383 --> 01:06:20,798
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">No hair here, nor here.
Like little girls.</font></font>

644
01:06:20,883 --> 01:06:25,090
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">And when they do have hair,
it looks like...</font></font>

645
01:06:26,174 --> 01:06:29,965
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">The moustache of our great Führer.</font></font>

646
01:06:31,508 --> 01:06:34,132
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">The pictures kind of turn me on.</font></font>

647
01:06:46,758 --> 01:06:50,382
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">Herr Adler. Where's the Führer?</font></font>

648
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:55,798
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">The Führer is dead.
Long live the new Führer.</font></font>

649
01:06:56,189 --> 01:06:58,757
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">That's me, in case you're wondering.</font></font>

650
01:07:05,341 --> 01:07:08,423
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">Sieg Heil! This way.</font></font>

651
01:07:40,633 --> 01:07:45,108
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">From now on, of course,
it's "Heil Adler".</font></font>

652
01:07:57,341 --> 01:08:01,673
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">Time... is the sin.</font></font>

653
01:08:03,383 --> 01:08:06,173
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">I'll see you in Valhalla.</font></font>

654
01:08:49,841 --> 01:08:53,465
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">At 5.45 we'll start firing back.</font></font>

655
01:08:53,549 --> 01:08:57,923
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500"><i>Every bomb will be retaliated.</i></font></font>

656
01:08:58,008 --> 01:09:01,548
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500"><i>The Meteorblitzkrieg shall begin!</i></font></font>

657
01:09:43,299 --> 01:09:45,490
<i>Moments ago, New York
has come under attack.</i>

658
01:09:45,570 --> 01:09:50,990
Witnesses claim to have seen hundreds of UFO's
appearing suddenly over the city and opening fire.

659
01:09:51,797 --> 01:09:55,610
Billy get that. Get that.
Are you getting that?

660
01:09:55,690 --> 01:09:58,246
Kelly, the craft is at
least 60 feet across.

661
01:09:58,326 --> 01:10:02,754
I'm seeing what appears to be weapons
of some-kind dangling down from the bottom.

662
01:10:02,834 --> 01:10:07,576
Oh my God. It's opening fire, it's opening
fire. I'm getting the hell out of here.

663
01:10:07,656 --> 01:10:11,321
<i>There is little information.
But here's what we know at this time.</i>

664
01:10:11,401 --> 01:10:15,224
- Ok, you see, the thing is, that Klaus...
- I know it was your doing.

665
01:10:17,106 --> 01:10:20,607
- It's wonderful.
- It's wonderful?

666
01:10:20,857 --> 01:10:23,687
It's brilliant.
I'm a wartime president now.

667
01:10:23,767 --> 01:10:27,337
All presidents who start a war in their
first term, always get re-elected.

668
01:10:27,734 --> 01:10:30,134
I thought I was
gonna have to bomb Australia or something.

669
01:10:30,606 --> 01:10:34,144
But no, you bring me real...

670
01:10:35,127 --> 01:10:38,235
- Who are these guys anyway?
- Nazis.

671
01:10:39,303 --> 01:10:43,245
- From the Moon.
- Real live Nazis?

672
01:10:43,325 --> 01:10:46,145
Holy shit, this just keeps
getting better and better.

673
01:10:46,547 --> 01:10:48,739
You're a miracle worker, babe.

674
01:10:49,516 --> 01:10:55,137
Ah, they're the only guys we ever actually
managed to beat in a fair fight.

675
01:10:56,088 --> 01:10:58,809
I'm just like Franklin D. Roosevelt,
only you know I'm not a spastic.

676
01:10:59,598 --> 01:11:01,401
I knew you'd be excited.

677
01:11:01,984 --> 01:11:08,292
So, if you’re our Roosevelt, then who's your
um... General Patton, or, you know, MacArthur?

678
01:11:09,167 --> 01:11:12,407
- Mr. Secretary of Defense. Do you have
any thoughts on this?
- Send her.

679
01:11:15,778 --> 01:11:18,192
- Me?
- Hey, you're the miracle worker.

680
01:11:18,663 --> 01:11:20,675
Apparently you dodge bullets too.

681
01:11:21,604 --> 01:11:23,659
- I wouldn't know..
- What to wear? Huh!

682
01:11:23,739 --> 01:11:25,779
You'll think of something. You always do.

683
01:11:25,987 --> 01:11:28,193
- Madam President...
- Huh?

684
01:11:28,273 --> 01:11:30,172
Ready to face the music?

685
01:11:59,030 --> 01:12:02,730
It's SPACE NAZIIIS!

686
01:12:20,930 --> 01:12:23,372
Take us upstate.
We need to go back to the Moon.

687
01:12:23,452 --> 01:12:26,949
Whoa, whoa... We? No, no, no. See, 'we'
rhymes with 'me', and I ain't goin'.

688
01:12:27,029 --> 01:12:29,433
You don't get it. They have
the <i>Götterdämmerung</i> on the Moon.

689
01:12:29,513 --> 01:12:32,870
I could give a good damn what they have.
I'm not going back to that place. No way!

690
01:12:32,950 --> 01:12:34,783
You want to look like that
for the rest of your life?

691
01:12:34,863 --> 01:12:36,837
Oh great. Now this is my fault.

692
01:12:39,401 --> 01:12:43,494
- <i>Let me in.</i>
- I'm no hero, James.

693
01:12:44,437 --> 01:12:45,894
I need you.

694
01:13:52,830 --> 01:13:55,130
Do you know how
to drive this thing?

695
01:13:56,422 --> 01:14:00,196
Well, can't be any different
than playing 'Wing Commander'.

696
01:14:00,557 --> 01:14:02,388
Lets try...

697
01:14:29,530 --> 01:14:33,550
I swear we do not have nothing on the Moon!

698
01:14:33,630 --> 01:14:35,430
- Japan?
- It is not ours.

699
01:14:35,510 --> 01:14:37,230
- China?
- It is not us.

700
01:14:37,430 --> 01:14:39,330
It's bloody well not ours.

701
01:14:39,410 --> 01:14:43,130
- I confess
- Yes, North Korea? Confess to what?

702
01:14:43,330 --> 01:14:45,539
The spaceships are ours.

703
01:14:46,630 --> 01:14:51,430
Our beloved leader designed
and build them himself.

704
01:14:58,184 --> 01:15:02,530
- What is so funny?
- All right, North Korea. Sit down.

705
01:15:16,345 --> 01:15:20,630
- So it was you India, I knew that.
- No, no, no. That is a sign of peace.

706
01:15:20,710 --> 01:15:22,144
This is the sign of peace.

707
01:15:22,224 --> 01:15:24,080
Just cut it out, you morons.

708
01:15:24,330 --> 01:15:29,530
These thugs are Nazis.
And I mean the real... McCoy.

709
01:15:29,930 --> 01:15:32,255
They've been hidin' out on the moon
just waiting to pounce.

710
01:15:33,605 --> 01:15:36,730
Now my question is,
what do ya'll plan to do about it?

711
01:15:36,930 --> 01:15:40,130
Cuz we just happen to have a little
something up our own sleeve,

712
01:15:40,330 --> 01:15:43,430
and I'm sure,
they'll be thankful for it.

713
01:15:43,630 --> 01:15:49,630
May I present to you with the Mars
exploration ship, the USS George W. Bush.

714
01:15:54,106 --> 01:15:57,330
Good work, take it to Officer Tyler please.

715
01:16:00,730 --> 01:16:04,130
Trajectory, what's our status
on the orbit window?

716
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:06,830
Commander on deck.

717
01:16:17,930 --> 01:16:21,930
The hostile fleet have launched a full scale
aerial attack against the United States.

718
01:16:22,230 --> 01:16:26,693
These Zeppelins appear to be carriers and they
are operating fully within the thermosphere.

719
01:16:26,982 --> 01:16:32,330
Each of them carry approximately 200
enemy vessels and are extremely...

720
01:16:32,936 --> 01:16:36,430
Hell hath no fury, Herr Adler.

721
01:16:36,730 --> 01:16:40,107
Alright kiddies.
Let's get this show on the road.

722
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:53,430
Vivian, you look great.
How is it going up there?

723
01:16:53,530 --> 01:16:55,630
Madam President,
I couldn't be better.

724
01:16:55,730 --> 01:16:58,430
I am packing dozens of mega tons
of nuclear warheads

725
01:16:58,510 --> 01:17:01,907
which I am going to carefully
place up Klaus's kraut ass.

726
01:17:01,987 --> 01:17:05,625
- Just as soon I get him in my sights.
- Carry on. Kick butt.

727
01:17:05,850 --> 01:17:08,278
Let 'em see what that baby can do.

728
01:17:18,993 --> 01:17:20,496
That's right.

729
01:17:20,576 --> 01:17:24,335
While you were arguing about climate
change, human rights and Whales' dicks,

730
01:17:24,851 --> 01:17:26,916
this is what we were doing.

731
01:17:27,142 --> 01:17:29,996
May I present to you
the tomorrow's exploration ship,

732
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:33,141
the USS George W. Bush.

733
01:17:33,526 --> 01:17:35,833
Mars exploration?

734
01:17:36,789 --> 01:17:38,874
But you have armed it.

735
01:17:39,201 --> 01:17:44,253
We have the right to bear arms,
and Mars is a red planet.

736
01:18:09,712 --> 01:18:14,235
Working at optimum capacity.
Ammo consumption within tolerance.

737
01:18:28,631 --> 01:18:33,140
<i>We're coming under extremely heavy fire.
Were gonna need reinforcements right now.</i>

738
01:18:35,969 --> 01:18:37,550
What the hell is the meaning of this?

739
01:18:37,786 --> 01:18:41,582
<i>G'day mates. This is Australian ship,
Dundee 01. Ready to kick ass.</i>

740
01:18:41,838 --> 01:18:43,536
<i>Spitfire reporting in.</i>

741
01:18:43,616 --> 01:18:46,436
<i>Hang in there W.
Canada joining your battle.</i>

742
01:18:46,516 --> 01:18:51,697
<i>This is a direct violation of this nations' space
treaty that you all signed, every single one of you.</i>

743
01:18:51,777 --> 01:18:53,681
<i>MIR join in za battle.</i>

744
01:18:58,677 --> 01:19:00,673
That is suppose to be destroyed.

745
01:19:00,938 --> 01:19:05,457
This is an outrage. You're all
liars, just like my ex ex-husband.

746
01:19:06,356 --> 01:19:10,338
- Calm down lady, calm down.
- Don't you lady me, Pinko.

747
01:19:10,574 --> 01:19:12,877
Okay, who didn't arm
their spaceships?

748
01:19:13,697 --> 01:19:17,693
Oh great, great.
That's just great.

749
01:19:17,773 --> 01:19:20,360
- You all gave me your word.
- But you broke yours.

750
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:22,440
We always break ours,
that's just what we do.

751
01:19:23,161 --> 01:19:25,950
Okay fine.
Fine, fine, fine, fine.

752
01:19:26,030 --> 01:19:29,569
Let just beat the shit out of these pricks
and ah, talk about the details later.

753
01:19:54,126 --> 01:19:58,750
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">Heroes of the First Fleet, continue
your attack to the last man -</font></font>

754

760
01:21:00,658 --> 01:21:02,184
This is beautiful.

761
01:21:13,195 --> 01:21:16,856
- Where the hell are we goin'?
- To the <i>Götterdämmerung</i>.

762
01:21:17,508 --> 01:21:19,131
I think Klaus will be there.

763
01:21:29,553 --> 01:21:32,076
What did you think of that, Herr Adler?

764
01:21:32,575 --> 01:21:34,687
Alright, what about this Moon business?

765
01:21:34,767 --> 01:21:38,056
What do you say we head on over
and slap them around a bit.

766
01:21:39,429 --> 01:21:42,411
Klaus baby, I coming to get ya'.

767

771
01:22:09,836 --> 01:22:16,162
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">- Well? - The Earth fleet will be within 
firing range in 20 minutes, my Führer.</font></font>

772
01:22:20,042 --> 01:22:23,968
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">- Are your troops ready?
- We're waiting for Dr. Richter.</font></font>

773
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:38,980
- What the hell is this place?
- This is the <i>Götterdämmerung</i>.

774
01:22:39,060 --> 01:22:40,589
'It will liberate the Earth!'

775
01:22:41,835 --> 01:22:43,223
Actually.

776
01:22:44,242 --> 01:22:47,336
It's the biggest war machine
ever created by man.

777
01:22:52,593 --> 01:22:55,223
This is the bridge. That's where I'm going.

778
01:22:56,207 --> 01:22:57,927
I need to find your father, so...

779
01:22:58,357 --> 01:23:01,356
- where you think he at?
- I think you will find him over there.

780
01:23:02,103 --> 01:23:05,516
Try to sneak in,
and please paralyze the engines,

781
01:23:06,193 --> 01:23:12,114
- or otherwise the Earth is destroyed.
- Note to self, paralyze engines. Got it.

782
01:23:12,194 --> 01:23:14,337
- Ok.
- Oh. No-no-no-no.

783
01:23:14,417 --> 01:23:15,976
- What?
- You be careful.

784
01:23:16,503 --> 01:23:18,156
- I mean, you know, ah...
- What?

785
01:23:18,787 --> 01:23:22,119
- Because, well, you like me.
- Right...

786
01:23:22,199 --> 01:23:24,813
Oh, come on, a little.

787
01:23:30,038 --> 01:23:31,856
You like me.

788
01:23:49,984 --> 01:23:53,050
We have a visual on the
Nazi fortress, Commander.

789
01:23:55,475 --> 01:23:58,356
Obvious and overstated
as usual, Klaus.

790
01:24:17,212 --> 01:24:18,456
COME ON!!!

791
01:24:18,536 --> 01:24:23,176
Automated targeting reports hit percentage above
100, so we're consistently achieving double kills.

792
01:24:23,256 --> 01:24:24,646
BOOM, BITCHES!!

793
01:24:33,627 --> 01:24:36,048
Alright everyone,
let's get those nukes in action.

794
01:24:36,128 --> 01:24:39,808
<i>- I'm declaring this fortress a free-fire-zone.</i>
- But Commander, there are woman and children done there.

795
01:24:39,888 --> 01:24:43,846
The United States of America
does not negotiate with terrorists.

796
01:24:49,742 --> 01:24:52,469
- Prime warheads on secondary armament.
- Roger that.

797
01:24:52,549 --> 01:24:56,512
- Prepare all available ordinance for ground bombardment.
- Fire the fucking nukes!

798
01:24:59,157 --> 01:25:00,752
Nukes away.

799
01:25:37,744 --> 01:25:39,423
Job well done.

807
01:26:08,859 --> 01:26:12,257
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">I would say three months,
give or take a little.</font></font>

808
01:26:12,618 --> 01:26:14,671
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">I give you three minutes.</font></font>

Hey quack!

811
01:26:23,249 --> 01:26:24,303
Remember me?

812
01:26:26,423 --> 01:26:29,128
The moon spook you
turned into a snowflake.

813
01:26:33,130 --> 01:26:34,211
<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">Start the Helium-3 engines.</font></font>

814

815

816
01:26:46,824 --> 01:26:48,264

818
01:27:36,220 --> 01:27:40,156
He sure must have the smallest
dick in the Universe.

819

<font size="14"><font color="#FFA500">Load the cannons.</font></font>

820

821
01:27:54,061 --> 01:27:55,856
to fuck back.

822
01:28:10,221 --> 01:28:16,131
Everyone, take positions around this fat
phallus and wait for my command to open fire.

823
01:28:23,790 --> 01:28:26,495

- Helium.

Did you say Helium-3?

869
01:36:34,155 --> 01:36:38,555
Yes, there like 15 to 20 giant towers
that appear to be full of the stuff.

870

- That's ours.
- It is? Why?

871

there, but ultimately it's just like World War II...

We did.

into our hearts, or we will burn...</i>

893

burning in eternal damnation.</i>

894
01:40:11,227 --> 01:40:12,955
Renate!

895
01:40:15,829 --> 01:40:17,555
Washington.

896
01:40:30,705 --> 01:40:33,555
You are alive.

897
01:40:34,006 --> 01:40:37,225
It's okay.
It's okay.

898
01:40:45,769 --> 01:40:48,555
And you are the way
you're meant to be.

899
01:41:01,096 --> 01:41:04,155
Are you aware that you
are kissing a black man?

900
01:41:11,855 --> 01:41:15,030
I guess you have a lot
of work cut out for you.
