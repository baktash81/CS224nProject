00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:53,611
Hey. Can I have
some more coffee, please?

4
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,619
Where you going?

5
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:01,650
Excuse me.

6
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,757
Bitch.

7
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,797
Hello?

8
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,613
Hello?

9
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,984
Anyone here?

10
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:52,306
Lady. Lady.

11
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:56,345
Hello?

12
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:09,484
What the fuck?

13
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:38,383
Dean. Dean.

14
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:43,387
I told you, if you keep falling asleep,
they're gonna kick you cut cf here.

15
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,724
Urn, sorry. Won’t happen again, okay?

16
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:49,291
Okay.

17
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,932
Nancy.
-Hey, Kris. You can sit wherever you want.

18
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:32,167
-Actually, I’m just here to meet Dean.
-Oh, he’s right over there.

19
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,073
Thanks.

20
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,378
Hey.

21
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,819
Wow, you look like you haven't--

22
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:44,512
Like I haven't slept in three days?

23
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:51,455
Dean, what's going on?

24
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:53,222
Sc, what are we doing after this?

25
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:56,560
Let me see if we can go
to Ashley’s or whatever.

26
00:05:58,091 --> 00:05:59,832
Then I don't know.

27
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,602
Look cut, here comes your girlfriend.

28
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:05,003
-Oh, hey.
-Hi. Can I get you guys anything else?

29
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:08,678
Uh.... Um....

30
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:14,445
No, I think we’re good. We’ll just get the check.

31
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,784
Is that the only thing you wanna ask her, Quentin?

32
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:26,687
Asshole.

33
00:06:31,658 --> 00:06:33,331
Hey.

34
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:36,002
Why is Kris with Dean?

35
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,509
Okay.

36
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,212
Come on.

37
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:48,514
That's fucked up.

38
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,654
What was that all about?

39
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:56,123
Um, Jesse's just--
He's pissed because Kris broke up with him.

40
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:59,162
-I didn't even know they were together.
-Yeah.

41
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:02,891
I guess I can keep the change?

42
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:05,659
Yeah. Look...

43
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:08,370
...I'm sorry about the mess.

44
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,940
-These guys are just--
-I'm used to it.

45
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,509
Sc you ever get tired
cf working here every weekend?

46
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:16,170
Do you ever get tired
cf coming here every weekend?

47
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:20,443
Quentin. You coming or no?

48
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:27,587
Sorry. Look, this should
take care cf the rest cf it.

49
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:31,021
-Sec-1 you around.
-Sec-1 you.

50
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:38,064
Listen, maybe you should
talk to somebody.

51
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:40,533
I did.

52
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:45,443
And he thinks all my problems
come from my past.

53
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,836
We began going through my childhood...

54
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:50,641
...and that's when they started.

55
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:54,112
When what started?

56
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,077
These nightmares.

57
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,319
Nightmares.

58
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:02,257
Sc, what, you can't sleep?

59
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:05,192
I can sleep.

60
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:07,758
I just don't want to.

61
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:10,334
Okay, Dean, listen to me.

62
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,994
They're just dreams.
Okay? They're not real.

63
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,941
These dreams...

64
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:18,269
...they're real.

65
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,173
They're nut.

66
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,906
They're re-- I'm sorry, Kris.

67
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,140
—No, it’s
—Kris,

68
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:27,581
No, no. It’s fine.
I’m gonna go clean myself off.

69
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:28,981
It’s okay. It’s okay.

70
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:01,117
You're not real.

71
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:03,049
You're not real. You're not real!

72
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:05,289
I am now.

73
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,718
Dean, what are you doing?

74
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,952
You're not real.
-Dean, stop it. Dean.

75
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:13,589
Dean, stop it!

76
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:16,623
Dean!

77
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:20,136
Dean!

78
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:33,941
Tragedy can shake us at our core...

79
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:37,145
...and it can also unite us
in our shared grief.

80
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,915
Today we are gathered and united...

81
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:45,588
...for the tragic loss of a young m I with so much life ahead of him.

82
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,154
Let us pray.

83
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:53,494
Lord, you who can
turn the shadow cf death...

84
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,641
...into the light cf a new day...

85
00:09:56,796 --> 00:10:01,006
...as we gather to commend Dean
into your hands...

86
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:06,116
...help us to wait upon thee
with penitent hearts...

87
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:11,187
...and remind us cf he who died
that we might live.

88
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,902
--and the power and the glory
- forever and ever. Amen.

89
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,472
Amen.
-Come on, sweetie. It’s over.

90
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:37,640
Yeah.

91
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:50,760
Let's go say hi.

92
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:54,126
-Gwen. Hi, h

93
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:58,694
-It’s been a long time.
-Yeah, yeah.

94
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:02,135
-- Especially under these circumstances.
- Yeah, not a....

95
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:05,105
You know, Nance,
if you need someone to talk to....

96
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:07,376
I’m okay.
Thank you.

97
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:09,673
We're setting up a crisis center
at the school.

98
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:13,215
-- You know where my office is, right, Nancy?
- Yeah.

99
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:15,717
We're gonna head cut. Take care.
-Good to see you.

100
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,855
Bye-bye, Quentin.

101
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,142
You knew Dean that far back?

102
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:42,280
Jesus, that is me.
But I don't know how I'm in that picture.

103
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:45,208
I didn't meet Dean until high school.

104
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,512
Come on.

105
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:55,188
-Dean said something right before he died.
-Oh, please don't.

106
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:58,359
He said, "You're not real."

107
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:01,556
He kept repeating it over and over again.

108
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,497
Do you have any idea what that means?

109
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:10,163
No. I don't.

110
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:15,001
Think about it. What would it mean? Dean was on a load of medication when--

111
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:16,203
Jesse.

112
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,982
When it happened, it was like
somebody was making him do it...

113
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:22,983
...but there was nobody there.

114
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,487
Jesse, you have to believe me.

115
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:32,790
Kris, it was late and you were scared.
Your mind was just playing tricks on you...

116
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:34,989
-...that's all.
-I believe you.

117
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:39,893
You do?

118
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,473
I've seen....

119
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,403
-I saw--
-You didn't see anything.

120
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,473
You weren't right there. Kris was.

121
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,677
She’s already fucked up, I so leave her alone.

122
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:02,025
You have no idea what I’ve seen.I

123
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,530
Let’s go home.

124
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:29,808
-Hi.
-Hi.

125
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:35,610
Hey, Mom, where are all the photos of me
from when I was younger?

126
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,119
-They're not here.
-Oh, well, who knows?

127
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:41,121
They’re probably packed away
over the garage. Why?

128
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:45,060
Because today at the funeral I, um....

129
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:49,934
I saw a photo cf Dean and I
when we were, like, 5.

130
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:54,333
But, you know, it's funny, I don't remember
knowing Dean before high school.

131
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:56,838
Who can remember being 5 years old?

132
00:14:56,996 --> 00:15:00,341
Hey, why don't you pack those up?
Dinner's almost ready.

133
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:14,788
Good night, honey.

134
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:47,677
Remember me?

135
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,376
Kris? You okay?

136
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:10,824
What is that?

137
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:12,593
Uh, nothing.

138
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,332
Just, like, a sketch.

139
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:17,333
Are you okay?

140
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:21,368
-Yeah, I’m okay.
-Yeah?

141
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:23,377
Are you okay?

142
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,641
Yeah, you know.

143
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:32,748
You know, like, if you ever need somebody,
if you ever wanna talk to somebody, I--

144
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:36,288
I'm sure you have like a thousand
other people you could talk to...

145
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,793
...but if you wanna talk to somebody....

146
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:40,520
Thanks.

147
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:45,131
Quentin. You're gonna be late to class.
Come on, buddy, let's go.

148
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,532
-My dad.
-I know.

149
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:55,368
Now, class, it was Pericles
who told the Athenian people...

150
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:58,071
...they should all gather
into the gates cf the city...

151
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:01,309
while his naval fleet picked off the Spartans by sea.

152
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,954
Now, it was to be a slow
but sure victory.

153
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:08,456
The Spartans would never make it over the walls of the acropolis, Pericles said.

154
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:12,994
• But what he didn’t take into account is that the plague would eventually strike.

155
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:16,099
Open your bucks to page 84.

156
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,392
To further complicate matters...

157
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:22,698
...the Spartans were armed
with a variety cf weapons...

158
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:24,808
...some cf them even improvised.

159
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:28,741
And they would not hesitate to slaughter
every Athenian they saw...

160
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:30,676
...even
children.

161
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:35,410
Especially the children cf soldiers.
This is where the....

162
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:36,985
Wake up.

163
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:39,987
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

164
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:46,624
You really shouldn't fall asleep in class.

165
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:59,371
Hi, Kris.
-Who are you?

166
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:02,638
You look just as beautiful...

167
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,311
...as ever.

168
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:12,846
You have nothing to worry about.

169
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,784
This won't hurt...

170
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:17,453
. . . 0 Fl e. . .

171
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,027
...little...

172
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:21,221
...bit.

173
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,292
Are you okay, Miss Fowles?

174
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:29,070
What happened?

175
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:31,675
I'm sorry.

176
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:41,278
What?

177
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:56,627
Kris!

178
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,897
Rufus.

179
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:34,533
Rufus, what are you doing?

180
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:38,542
Huh? What are you doing cut here?

181
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,936
Come on.

182
00:21:42,168 --> 00:21:43,203
Rufus.

183
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:47,142
Come on.

184
00:22:09,862 --> 00:22:10,897
Hey.

185
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:14,272
I have to fly to London
on a red eye tonight.

186
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:16,037
Okay.

187
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:20,975
You gonna be okay?

188
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,350
Yeah, I'm fine.

189
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:26,313
I'm gonna be all right. Have a safe flight.

190
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:28,755
I just worry about you.

191
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:31,861
-Try and get some sleep.
-Okay.

192
00:22:32,418 --> 00:22:34,762
I'll call you when I land.

193
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:37,865
I love you.

194
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,696
Love you.

195
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:48,197
Jesus, Jesse.

196
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,906
-What the hell are you doing here?
-Are you gonna let me in?

197
00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:56,171
Yeah, come in.

198
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:03,685
All right, I know I've been an asshole...

199
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:06,948
...and I've been jealous
and I've been fucked up.

200
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:10,025
But Dean was my friend too.

201
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:12,389
Will you please tell me
what's been going on?

202
00:24:15,588 --> 00:24:17,932
I'm having these dreams.

203
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,600
And I'm scared.

204
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:25,403
I think Dean was having them too.

205
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:33,713
Kris, listen, we've all--

206
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:35,977
I know what you're gonna say.

207
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:41,654
But now every time I dream...

208
00:24:42,715 --> 00:24:45,218
...I always see this man.

209
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:48,594
And he's....

210
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:52,930
He's burned...

211
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:57,567
...and melted.
And he's always trying to...

212
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:00,506
-...attack me with these knives--
-Knives on his fingers.

213
00:25:03,569 --> 00:25:05,207
What?

214
00:25:06,405 --> 00:25:07,850
Oh, my God.

215
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:11,615
We're having the same dream.

216
00:25:11,777 --> 00:25:13,848
-Kris, it's not possible.
-It is possible.

217
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:15,651
-It's just a dream, all right?
-It's not a dream.

218
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:17,961
Shh. Shh.

219
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:20,792
Shh. Shh.

220
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:22,489
Oh, God.

221
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:24,357
I’m so afraid.

222
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:28,801
All I wanna do is go to sleep,
but if I do he's gonna kill me like Dean.

223
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:33,776
Maybe we should just
stop talking about it, all right?

224
00:25:33,933 --> 00:25:38,439
We keep talking about it, we'll keep thinking
about it, then we'll keep dreaming about it.

225
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:41,479
Look at me.

226
00:25:45,444 --> 00:25:47,390
You'll stay with me?

227
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:50,056
Of course I'll stay with you.

228
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:13,947
Rufus!

229
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,075
Rufus, get in here!

230
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:18,919
Rufus!

231
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:21,251
Ugh. Shit.

232
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:25,725
Rufus.

233
00:26:28,654 --> 00:26:30,497
Rufus?

234
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,800
Rufus, come here, buy!

235
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:38,737
Come here.

236
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:48,377
Ru--

237
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:56,383
Ru-- Rufus.

238
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:02,195
Oh, my--

239
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:06,268
I was just petting him.

240
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,506
Jess! Help!

241
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:13,108
No! No!

242
00:27:13,265 --> 00:27:15,745
Help me, please! Help me!

243
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,803
One, two

244
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:46,442
Freddy's coming for you

245
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:49,738
-Come on. Come on.
-Three, four, better lock your door

246
00:27:49,902 --> 00:27:51,176
We have to hide.

247
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:54,442
-- Five, six, grab your crucifix
- Five...

248
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,648
-Seven, eight, gonna stay up late
-...four...

249
00:27:57,809 --> 00:27:59,652
...three...

250
00:27:59,812 --> 00:28:01,951
...two...

251
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:03,850
...one.

252
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:07,263
-Ready or not
-Oh, my God.

253
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:12,127
...
here I come.

254
00:28:29,608 --> 00:28:31,212
-Jesse?
Fm.

255
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,083
Jess?

256
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,805
Found you.

257
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:30,436
Kris! All right-- Hey! Hey! Kris, stop!

258
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:33,075
Kris! Stop! Kris!

259
00:29:40,312 --> 00:29:41,950
Oh, my God.

260
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:43,559
Wake up!

261
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:45,225
Kris!

262
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:47,594
Kris!

263
00:30:00,766 --> 00:30:02,803
Oh, shit.

264
00:30:04,837 --> 00:30:06,475
Kris?

265
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:11,148
Oh, God.

266
00:30:12,678 --> 00:30:14,385
Kris?

267
00:30:20,052 --> 00:30:22,225
Oh, shit.

268
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:27,794
Fuck.

269
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:40,443
Okay, okay.;0]

270
00:30:40,606 --> 00:30:42,882
Okay, okay, okay.

271
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:45,749
Hey! Hey, you! I'm calling the cups!

272
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:51,626
GWEN!
Honey?

273
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:56,794
Nancy.

274
00:30:57,956 --> 00:31:00,334
-Nancy
-Yeah?

275
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,567
It’s the middle of the night. You need to go to sleep, hon.

276
00:31:03,729 --> 00:31:04,764
Okay, I will.

277
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:07,103
-Now.
-Okay.

278
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:18,482
Shh! Shh. Shh.

279
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:21,624
-Nancy, it’s me. It’s m
-Jesse. What the--?

280
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,618
-Hey, hey.
-What are you doing here?

281
00:31:23,782 --> 00:31:26,956
-Stop. Just listen to me, okay?
-What happened to you?

282
00:31:27,586 --> 00:31:31,591
-Whose blood is that? Is it your blood?
-Listen, okay? Please.

283
00:31:31,757 --> 00:31:33,828
-I was with Kris and--
-What'd you do to her?

284
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:38,372
I didn't do anything, I'm trying to tell you. Listen to me, something's going on, okay?

285
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:42,137
-Tell me what happened to Kris, Jesse.
-Someone killed her in her sleep.

286
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:46,779
What?

287
00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:49,949
-What are you talking about?
-Don’t pretend you don’t know...

288
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:52,486
...because you do.
You said it at the funeral.

289
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:55,557
He’s the one who’s trying to kill us in our dreams..

290
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:59,255
-All I keep hearing is the sung.
-What sung?

291
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,922
One, two

292
00:32:03,822 --> 00:32:06,200
Freddy's coming for you

293
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:08,496
Freddy.

294
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:13,265
-That’s his name and he’s in all of our heads.
-No, that’s impossible. No.

295
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:16,176
Nancy.

296
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:19,076
Shit. We gotta stop this.

297
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:21,683
-How?
-I don't know.

298
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,842
Just don't fall asleep.

299
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:26,216
If you die in your dreams,
you die for real.

300
00:32:26,378 --> 00:32:29,154
Nancy? Who's in there?

301
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:34,487
Oh, shit.

302
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:44,537
Police. Don't move!

303
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:48,536
Get down! Get down!

304
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,043
-- I didn't do anything.
- Down!

305
00:32:50,202 --> 00:32:52,239
Listen to me, I didn't do anything. Please.

306
00:32:52,404 --> 00:32:54,008
-- Get down!
- Aah!

307
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,978
I loved her, man! I couldn’t kill her!

308
00:32:58,143 --> 00:32:59,622
What's going on down there?

309
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:01,121
I didn't do anything! Stop!

310
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,314
Shut up.

311
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:05,695
-Get up.
-I didn't kill her! You know!

312
00:33:05,851 --> 00:33:08,764
-- Shut the fuck up.
That's a roger, two-two.

313
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,794
Get up.

314
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,931
-Call it in, code four.
-Get him out of here.

315
00:33:18,697 --> 00:33:21,507
Copy that, we've got a homicide.

316
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,147
Code four. Homicide suspect in custody.

317
00:33:25,637 --> 00:33:28,641
Nancy! You know! You know who did it!

318
00:33:33,445 --> 00:33:35,015
Coming in.

319
00:33:36,815 --> 00:33:38,522
Open three.

320
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:41,058
Clear.

321
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:42,596
Clear four.

322
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:44,995
-- Let him cut.
- All right.

323
00:33:46,091 --> 00:33:48,571
Hold five open.

324
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:53,434
Open four.

325
00:34:30,936 --> 00:34:33,246
Hello?
-Hi, it's Nancy.

326
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:34,645
Hey.

327
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:38,083
You said to call you if I needed to talk.

328
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:42,017
-Yeah.
-Kris is dead.

329
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:48,597
Stay awake.

330
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:52,064
-Stay awake.
-Quiz-et.

331
00:34:58,063 --> 00:35:00,839
Shut the fuck up.

332
00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:20,060
That'll be $24.97.

333
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:17,453
Five, four, three, two....

334
00:36:27,586 --> 00:36:30,157
Five, six, seven....

335
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:01,693
Nightmares?

336
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:05,824
Yeah.

337
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:09,903
Freddy?

338
00:37:12,464 --> 00:37:13,636
Open four.

339
00:37:16,935 --> 00:37:18,380
Get up.

340
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:20,948
Folks posted your bail.

341
00:37:54,139 --> 00:37:56,244
Jesse, help me.

342
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,350
Help me, please.

343
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:06,752
Kris?

344
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:15,454
-Oh, God.
-No.

345
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:17,959
Just me.

346
00:39:20,892 --> 00:39:23,099
What do you want from me?

347
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:25,137
Hmm. I don't know, Jesse.

348
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:27,506
You think you can turn back time?

349
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:30,141
-Answer me!
-No.

350
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:32,577
Do you think you can
bring the dead back to life?

351
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:34,444
-No. No!
-No?

352
00:39:35,173 --> 00:39:37,175
I didn’t fucking think so.

353
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:39,880
No! No! No!

354
00:39:40,445 --> 00:39:45,861
Why are you screaming?
I haven't even cut you yet.

355
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:27,494
I didn't do it! I'm innocent

356
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:30,367
Get me cut cf here!

357
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:33,336
Let me the fuck cut cf here!

358
00:40:36,334 --> 00:40:40,180
Did you know
that after the heart stops beating...

359
00:40:40,338 --> 00:40:43,342
the brain keeps functioning for well over seven minutes?

360
00:40:45,076 --> 00:40:49,047
We gut six more minutes to play.

361
00:40:56,721 --> 00:41:00,760
-You okay?
-Yeah. I’m just really exhausted.

362
00:41:04,529 --> 00:41:05,564
Here.

363
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,777
-What's that?
-Zoneral.

364
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:16,518
It's basically speed for kids with ADD.
I've been on it since I was, like, 15.

365
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:18,654
No. No. No, thanks.

366
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:22,280
Nancy, look, you’re running on fumes. Here, okay? Are you sure? It’s--

367
00:41:22,447 --> 00:41:24,825
Yeah, I'm fine for now.

368
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:33,727
I didn't take you for the religious type.

369
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:37,163
Yeah, well, you gotta believe
in something, you know?

370
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:43,002
What’s this one doing here?

371
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,613
It's The Pied Piper of Hamelin.

372
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:49,274
I saw it in one of my dreams. It’s about
a guy who’s betrayed by a town...

373
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,216
...and he gets his revenge
by taking all their children.

374
00:41:52,644 --> 00:41:54,749
I keep dreaming about children too.

375
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:57,449
And then there's also a school.

376
00:41:58,283 --> 00:42:00,524
Well, it’s gotta mean something.

377
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:04,724
Yeah, but, I mean, what? We didn’t go to
school together until, like, 6th grade.

378
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:08,494
-Look, we're running cut cf time.
-What do you mean?

379
00:42:10,595 --> 00:42:14,008
Nightmares are triggered by the belief
that the dreamer has no control...

380
00:42:14,165 --> 00:42:15,667
...and this can cause insomnia.

381
00:42:16,434 --> 00:42:18,277
But then it says at the 70-hour mark...

382
00:42:18,436 --> 00:42:20,882
...the insomniac will begin
to experience micronaps.

383
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:25,314
"His brain will shut down its functions
for seconds in an attempt to recharge."

384
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:29,049
This basically means that you're dreaming,
but you don't know it.

385
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:31,887
Like, even if you're awake.

386
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:36,157
And then it says that after that,
your brain will shut down, inducing a coma.

387
00:42:37,322 --> 00:42:38,630
Which is permanent sleep.

388
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:53,075
Nancy?

389
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:57,579
Nancy?

390
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:02,715
Nancy.

391
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:24,773
Yeah?

392
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:28,209
Hey.

393
00:43:29,507 --> 00:43:31,043
Hey.

394
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:33,614
Where have you been?

395
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:35,917
I was at the bookstore.

396
00:43:36,814 --> 00:43:39,021
Okay, well,
I didn't know where you were.

397
00:43:39,517 --> 00:43:43,192
And I just feel like, with everything
that's been happening with your friends--

398
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:44,924
Hey, Mum?

399
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:47,831
Do I have some sort cf connection
with Kris...

400
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:50,131
...and Dean and Jesse?

401
00:43:50,295 --> 00:43:52,036
Or Quentin?

402
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:56,338
Like, maybe we went to school together
when we were little or something like that?

403
00:43:57,902 --> 00:43:59,575
Not that I can recall.

404
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:02,578
Did we ever know a guy named Freddy?

405
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:06,881
I don't think so.

406
00:44:12,617 --> 00:44:14,290
Okay.

407
00:44:22,627 --> 00:44:24,368
Good night.

408
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:27,405
Good night.

409
00:44:45,717 --> 00:44:47,924
Hey, it's Gwen.

410
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,530
Nancy's starting to remember.

411
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:55,606
Honey, you okay?

412
00:45:55,770 --> 00:45:57,750
Yeah, I'm fine, Mum.

413
00:45:57,905 --> 00:46:01,478
-All right. I'm going to bed.
-Okay.

414
00:47:23,224 --> 00:47:25,727
Little Nancy.

415
00:47:27,061 --> 00:47:29,302
All grown up.

416
00:47:29,463 --> 00:47:31,409
You're just a nightmare.

417
00:47:31,565 --> 00:47:33,476
That's right.

418
00:47:33,634 --> 00:47:36,843
No one can prove I was ever here.

419
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:38,947
Who are you?

420
00:47:41,542 --> 00:47:44,523
You don't remember?

421
00:47:45,813 --> 00:47:47,258
You must.

422
00:47:49,483 --> 00:47:51,724
You’re my number one.

423
00:47:53,888 --> 00:47:56,061
You're my...

424
00:47:56,957 --> 00:48:00,404
...little Nancy.

425
00:48:03,364 --> 00:48:05,207
I set an alarm.

426
00:48:05,366 --> 00:48:07,403
Yes, you did.

427
00:48:07,568 --> 00:48:09,479
In your dream.

428
00:48:12,573 --> 00:48:14,382
You smell different.

429
00:48:22,717 --> 00:48:23,855
Quentin?

430
00:48:24,018 --> 00:48:26,055
Nancy, he gut to him. Jesse's dead.

431
00:48:26,454 --> 00:48:28,559
He died in his sleep.

432
00:48:28,856 --> 00:48:30,563
I saw him.

433
00:48:30,725 --> 00:48:34,434
-l fell asleep. I saw Freddy.
-All right, I’m coming over.

434
00:48:35,263 --> 00:48:37,004
Okay.

435
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:50,086
Shit.

436
00:48:59,153 --> 00:49:00,427
So Bad ham’s a preschool.

437
00:49:00,588 --> 00:49:03,467
It’s on the other end of to It was closed years ago.

438
00:49:03,624 --> 00:49:06,002
Can't find any pictures.

439
00:49:06,594 --> 00:49:08,471
Wait, come here.

440
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:13,072
I drew this after my dream.

441
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:21,278
I don't know. I've never seen it before.

442
00:49:22,643 --> 00:49:26,056
How is the guy in our dreams
connected to the school?

443
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:28,056
I don't know.

444
00:49:30,785 --> 00:49:32,856
But I know my mom's hiding something.

445
00:49:40,494 --> 00:49:41,632
There's nothing here.

446
00:49:48,702 --> 00:49:50,340
Help me.

447
00:49:57,578 --> 00:49:59,285
What is that?

448
00:50:15,596 --> 00:50:17,542
We're all here.

449
00:50:18,499 --> 00:50:19,705
Kris, Jesse, Dean.

450
00:50:21,001 --> 00:50:23,413
It's me, it's you, it's--

451
00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:31,251
What are you doing?

452
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:32,919
What are you doing?

453
00:50:33,881 --> 00:50:36,191
Nancy, what is going on?

454
00:50:36,584 --> 00:50:39,394
-Give me the picture.
-I don't understand.

455
00:50:39,553 --> 00:50:44,400
You said that....
You said that we didn’t know each other.

456
00:50:44,725 --> 00:50:47,399
But we're all in this picture.
We went to school together.

457
00:50:47,561 --> 00:50:49,598
Give me the picture.

458
00:50:50,264 --> 00:50:52,073
-It’s okay.
-Why would you lie to me?

459
00:50:52,233 --> 00:50:55,703
-I didn't lie.
-It's right here. Why would you lie to me?

460
00:50:55,870 --> 00:50:58,407
-Stop lying. You're lying to me.
-I'm not lying to you.

461
00:50:58,572 --> 00:51:01,212
-Stop lying to me!
-I am not lying to you!

462
00:51:01,375 --> 00:51:04,584
I didn't want you to have to go
through your life with this memory!

463
00:51:04,745 --> 00:51:08,318
I didn’t want you to remember.
I wanted you to forget!

464
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:10,155
Remember what?

465
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:17,260
What happened at that preschool?

466
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:20,870
Smile, everybody.

467
00:51:21,028 --> 00:51:22,905
You guys look great.

468
00:51:23,064 --> 00:51:28,104
There was a man at the preschool.

469
00:51:28,269 --> 00:51:30,476
His name was Fred Krueger.

470
00:51:31,305 --> 00:51:32,750
One, two

471
00:51:32,906 --> 00:51:34,852
Freddy's coming for you

472
00:51:35,242 --> 00:51:38,348
Three, four
Better lock your door

473
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,321
He was a gardener.

474
00:51:41,615 --> 00:51:44,425
He lived in the basement
of the preschool...

475
00:51:44,585 --> 00:51:47,759
...and you kids were his life.

476
00:51:51,559 --> 00:51:53,197
Four...

477
00:51:53,561 --> 00:51:55,302
...three...

478
00:51:55,463 --> 00:51:56,771
...two...

479
00:51:57,264 --> 00:51:58,538
...one.

480
00:51:58,699 --> 00:52:00,372
We didn't wanna believe it at first.

481
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:02,639
• FREDDY Ready or not...

482
00:52:03,103 --> 00:52:05,014
You all were so innocent.

483
00:52:05,172 --> 00:52:07,277
...
here I come.

484
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:09,718
And you, Nancy...

485
00:52:10,444 --> 00:52:13,118
What are you drawing? That is so good.

486
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,759
...you were his favorite of all.

487
00:52:14,915 --> 00:52:17,156
You know what?
I got some other drawings.

488
00:52:17,317 --> 00:52:20,696
And they're, like, really bad drawings.
Maybe you can help me fix them?

489
00:52:20,855 --> 00:52:22,857
And then we started to notice things.

490
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:32,843
Yeah. Uh, he has been acting
a little strange lately.

491
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,971
He takes us to the secret cave.

492
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,181
It’s okay. It’s all rig ht.

493
00:52:41,742 --> 00:52:43,915
So, what did you do? Did you call the police?

494
00:52:44,078 --> 00:52:48,049
He left town before we ever
were able to confront him.

495
00:52:48,382 --> 00:52:51,261
He's gone. He can't hurt you anymore.

496
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:53,728
Sc these dreams that you're having...

497
00:52:55,055 --> 00:52:58,127
...they're repressed memories...

498
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:01,937
...from a terrible, terrible time.

499
00:53:03,431 --> 00:53:04,910
I hope that you’re rig ht.

500
00:53:08,269 --> 00:53:10,579
We have to find the other kids
in the picture.

501
00:53:10,938 --> 00:53:13,748
-What are you talking about? No.
-It doesn’t make any sense.

502
00:53:13,907 --> 00:53:16,945
-There's gotta be more to it. It's not--
-This makes total sense.

503
00:53:17,111 --> 00:53:19,182
You heard your mum.
These are just memories.

504
00:53:19,346 --> 00:53:21,622
-What if she’s wrong?
-We’re experiencing them...

505
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:24,854
-...living them, but they're just memories.
-How do you know that?

506
00:53:25,018 --> 00:53:27,259
Memories don't kill you.

507
00:53:34,028 --> 00:53:38,238
-Whoa, whoa, whoa! Quentin, get in the car.
-It's my dad. I gotta go.

508
00:53:38,532 --> 00:53:41,206
-We have to do something.
-Look, stop.

509
00:53:41,368 --> 00:53:42,972
This is crazy. Listen to yourself.

510
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:46,849
I'm sorry.

511
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:06,699
I want you to do 400 warm-up.
Then do a 200-back-breast drill swim.

512
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:09,966
Quentin, I need you to focus.
I need you to wake up, get into this.

513
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:12,041
Let's go. All right, guys.

514
00:54:12,199 --> 00:54:14,770
Step up. Let's go. On the blocks.

515
00:54:18,205 --> 00:54:20,344
Take your mark.

516
00:55:11,125 --> 00:55:13,127
Make sure you're working
your underwaters...

517
00:55:13,293 --> 00:55:15,204
...hit the turns, in and out really quick.

518
00:55:15,362 --> 00:55:17,342
Powerful dolphins off the wall.

519
00:55:17,498 --> 00:55:21,969
All right, guys, we’re gonna do eight 300s, descend one to four, hold five to eight.

520
00:55:22,136 --> 00:55:25,583
All right, hop cut.
On the blocks, guys. Let's go.

521
00:55:29,309 --> 00:55:30,652
Let's step up.

522
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:34,819
Take your mark.

523
00:55:40,588 --> 00:55:42,363
Come on, pick it up. Let's go. Come on.

524
00:55:42,523 --> 00:55:45,868
Come on. Come on, let's go. Attaboy.

525
00:55:49,363 --> 00:55:51,604
Come on, now. Come on.
Come on, let's go.

526
00:55:52,833 --> 00:55:54,779
Come on.

527
00:55:55,402 --> 00:55:57,211
Come on!

528
00:56:34,341 --> 00:56:36,014
Wait!

529
00:56:41,949 --> 00:56:43,053
Hey!

530
00:57:05,572 --> 00:57:07,017
Okay.

531
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:10,587
- Krueger!
- - Come on cut, you bastard!

532
00:57:20,621 --> 00:57:23,329
Goddamn it. You open this door, Krueger!

533
00:57:23,490 --> 00:57:24,594
What do you think I did?

534
00:57:24,758 --> 00:57:28,171
-I didn't do anything!
-Get your ass cut. Open the fucking door!

535
00:57:28,328 --> 00:57:30,001
-- I didn't do it!
- Norm, make sure...

536
00:57:30,163 --> 00:57:33,167
-...- he can't get cut the back!
- Okay.

537
00:57:37,204 --> 00:57:38,649
Stop!

538
00:57:38,805 --> 00:57:41,843
Stop. Okay.

539
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:49,220
Okay. Okay.

540
00:57:57,824 --> 00:58:00,805
What are you doing? No, no, no.
This isn’t the right way.

541
00:58:00,961 --> 00:58:03,237
-We gotta call the police.
-What is the right way?

542
00:58:03,397 --> 00:58:06,435
Our kids get on a stand,
tell a room cf people what happened?

543
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,739
-No, we've gut to call the police.
-He's right.

544
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:11,314
-- This is not the way to do this.
- This ends tonight.

545
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:24,486
Okay. Okay.

546
00:58:30,424 --> 00:58:31,596
This is for my son!

547
00:58:40,467 --> 00:58:41,502
Come cut, Krueger!

548
00:59:11,865 --> 00:59:13,003
No!

549
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:19,912
Are you okay?

550
00:59:22,776 --> 00:59:24,255
Go get the nurse.

551
00:59:24,411 --> 00:59:27,255
Breathe, breathe.
Come on. Come on, breathe.

552
00:59:27,414 --> 00:59:29,655
-- Relax and breathe. Come on. Come on.
- I’m okay.

553
00:59:49,369 --> 00:59:52,043
I had another nightmare last night.

554
00:59:52,573 --> 00:59:57,613
That burned man with the striped sweater,
he keeps trying to kill me.

555
00:59:57,778 --> 01:00:01,021
I ran a different way this time.
I ended up in front of a preschool.

556
01:00:01,181 --> 01:00:05,254
I woke up before I had a chance to explore,
but it has to mean something.

557
01:00:07,154 --> 01:00:09,930
He chased me
into the preschool this time.

558
01:00:10,090 --> 01:00:12,331
I got away,
made it down to the basement.

559
01:00:12,492 --> 01:00:15,371
But it feels like that's
where he wants me to go. Like...

560
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:17,509
...he needs me to find something.

561
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:22,376
I'm starting to dream
with my eyes open.

562
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:24,880
I can't tell what's real anymore.

563
01:00:25,672 --> 01:00:27,777
I haven't slept in three days.

564
01:00:28,642 --> 01:00:31,851
If I sleep, I dream.

565
01:00:32,012 --> 01:00:34,652
If I dream, I'm dead.

566
01:00:35,649 --> 01:00:39,256
Is there anybody else out there
that this is happening to?

567
01:00:39,419 --> 01:00:43,026
Can somebody help me?

568
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:44,225
Please?

569
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:08,088
They're all dead.

570
01:01:08,248 --> 01:01:09,989
I know what happened to Freddy.

571
01:01:13,653 --> 01:01:14,723
You killed Krueger.

572
01:01:16,256 --> 01:01:18,395
-Where'd you hear that name?
-You chased him...

573
01:01:18,558 --> 01:01:21,129
...cornered him and burned him
to death. You hunted him!

574
01:01:21,294 --> 01:01:23,570
We did not hunt him.
We were protecting you.

575
01:01:23,730 --> 01:01:26,233
-From what?
-From him. From what he did to you.

576
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:30,176
-From what you kids told us he did to you.
-We were 5. We would've said anything!

577
01:01:31,171 --> 01:01:33,617
-Why didn’t you go to the police?
-You were so young.

578
01:01:33,774 --> 01:01:36,414
No. God!
And the things we said he did....

579
01:01:36,576 --> 01:01:39,682
The cave. Did you ever find it?

580
01:01:39,846 --> 01:01:41,450
No.

581
01:01:43,583 --> 01:01:46,120
How do you know he was guilty?

582
01:01:46,753 --> 01:01:49,393
-Oh, my God.
-You killed an innocent man.

583
01:01:49,556 --> 01:01:50,626
Mm-mm.

584
01:01:50,791 --> 01:01:54,364
There's not a day that goes by that
I don't think about that night, Quentin.

585
01:01:54,527 --> 01:01:56,529
Good, you deserve at least that.

586
01:01:56,696 --> 01:02:01,236
Quentin. When you grow up
and you have kids...

587
01:02:01,401 --> 01:02:04,746
...I hope you never know the feeling
cf utterly failing to protect them.

588
01:02:04,905 --> 01:02:07,044
-Don’t tow -Son-- Don’t t

589
01:02:17,284 --> 01:02:18,661
You listen to me.

590
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:23,297
As far as everyone around here
is concerned, Fred Krueger never existed.

591
01:02:27,294 --> 01:02:28,739
Quentin.

592
01:02:29,730 --> 01:02:31,641
Quentin, wait. Wait.

593
01:02:31,798 --> 01:02:34,039
-What?
-Slow down.

594
01:02:34,568 --> 01:02:35,808
-Stop.
-We gut him killed.

595
01:02:37,004 --> 01:02:38,608
Our stories, our lies.

596
01:02:38,772 --> 01:02:40,911
-What if we can make him stop?
-What if we can?

597
01:02:41,074 --> 01:02:44,214
The preschool. Marcus said that
Freddy wanted him to find something.

598
01:02:44,377 --> 01:02:45,947
Fine.

599
01:02:47,914 --> 01:02:49,791
Nancy.

600
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:03,830
Don't you wanna hang cut, Nancy?

601
01:03:16,243 --> 01:03:18,086
What are you doing?

602
01:03:19,679 --> 01:03:22,751
I just saw Kris in a body bag.

603
01:03:24,818 --> 01:03:26,889
All right, you’ve been up for too long.

604
01:03:27,053 --> 01:03:29,033
You're having micronaps. We gotta go.

605
01:03:29,189 --> 01:03:31,396
Let's go find the preschool.

606
01:03:37,998 --> 01:03:39,341
What are we doing here?

607
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:41,711
I need more pills.

608
01:04:02,021 --> 01:04:04,592
Come on. Come on.

609
01:04:19,205 --> 01:04:24,587
Hi. Um, I'm gonna need a, um,
refill on that, please.

610
01:04:25,979 --> 01:04:28,016
On this, you're cut cf refills.

611
01:04:29,816 --> 01:04:32,387
I'm gonna have to
call the doctor on this.

612
01:04:32,552 --> 01:04:36,125
Look, I don't have time
to call a doctor. Look--

613
01:04:37,056 --> 01:04:39,093
Oh, my God.

614
01:04:57,377 --> 01:05:00,586
Look, I've been on this stuff
since I was 15.

615
01:05:00,747 --> 01:05:01,851
Okay? It's totally fine.

616
01:05:02,015 --> 01:05:04,962
You just go back, you fill it up and--
Even just a couple.

617
01:05:05,118 --> 01:05:07,394
-All I need is a couple.
-No. No, I’m sorry.

618
01:05:26,306 --> 01:05:28,752
When I want you

619
01:05:29,543 --> 01:05:32,422
In my arms
When I want you

620
01:05:32,579 --> 01:05:35,617
Quentin. Quentin.

621
01:05:37,083 --> 01:05:39,222
-Just fill it up.
-No.

622
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:44,697
Dream, dream, dream

623
01:05:44,858 --> 01:05:45,928
Quentin.

624
01:05:46,092 --> 01:05:50,268
When I feel blue
In the night

625
01:05:50,430 --> 01:05:55,140
And I need you
To hold me tight

626
01:05:55,301 --> 01:06:02,014
Whenever I want you
All I have to do is dream

627
01:06:37,043 --> 01:06:38,420
No. No.

628
01:06:48,021 --> 01:06:49,557
Wake up!

629
01:06:49,722 --> 01:06:51,668
You're bleeding.

630
01:06:55,562 --> 01:06:57,838
Oh, my God. What happened?

631
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:01,875
Hang on.

632
01:07:02,602 --> 01:07:04,707
His sweater.

633
01:07:04,871 --> 01:07:06,077
-o
-He’s here.

634
01:07:07,474 --> 01:07:09,886
Man, you're hurt really bad.

635
01:07:11,911 --> 01:07:14,915
Let's go to the hospital. Come on.

636
01:07:19,552 --> 01:07:22,089
Dr. Blake Mason to ICU, please.

637
01:07:30,997 --> 01:07:32,567
Baby.

638
01:07:33,366 --> 01:07:35,972
Oh, honey, honey, honey,
what happened?

639
01:07:36,369 --> 01:07:37,973
Who did this to you?

640
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:39,878
Look at it, Mum. You know who did it.

641
01:07:42,942 --> 01:07:44,114
You know who did it.

642
01:07:44,277 --> 01:07:46,086
Oh, honey.

643
01:07:49,983 --> 01:07:52,623
Dr. Zeger. Dr. William Zeger to CCU.

644
01:07:52,786 --> 01:07:56,427
Dr. Zeger. Dr. Zeger to CCU.

645
01:08:03,663 --> 01:08:05,472
Okay,
how we doing?

646
01:08:05,632 --> 01:08:07,339
It’s gonna be okay.

647
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:10,970
I'm gonna give you
a little something for the pain.

648
01:08:11,137 --> 01:08:14,084
-It’ll put you right out.
-It’s okay.

649
01:08:14,474 --> 01:08:17,182
• No, Mom, I don’t want it. I don’t want it. I don’t want it.

650
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:19,050
-It’s okay, it’s okay.
-No, Mom, no.

651
01:08:19,212 --> 01:08:22,591
-I don't want it. Don't let her do it.
-This might sting a bit.

652
01:08:22,749 --> 01:08:24,319
-- No! No!
- No, no.

653
01:08:24,484 --> 01:08:25,986
-Okay. Okay.
-No!

654
01:08:26,152 --> 01:08:28,928
-Where’s Quentin?
-Can I have a word with you in the hall?

655
01:08:29,455 --> 01:08:32,834
Don't leave. Don't leave, Mum. Mum.

656
01:08:32,992 --> 01:08:34,801
Where's Quentin? I need Quentin.

657
01:08:37,597 --> 01:08:40,407
Your daughter needs to be sedated,
but I can't do anything...

658
01:08:40,567 --> 01:08:44,014
-...without your authorization.
-I just want her to be cut cf pain.

659
01:08:44,170 --> 01:08:45,672
Good. Sign this.

660
01:08:53,813 --> 01:08:55,622
She'll be fine.

661
01:09:08,294 --> 01:09:09,967
Great.

662
01:09:28,314 --> 01:09:29,486
Thank you.

663
01:09:29,649 --> 01:09:31,322
-You okay?
-Yeah.

664
01:09:31,484 --> 01:09:33,555
-Yeah?
-What is that?

665
01:09:33,953 --> 01:09:37,162
-Adrenaline. Keep us awake.
-Where'd you get it?

666
01:09:37,323 --> 01:09:39,200
I stole it off one of the nurse’s carts!

667
01:09:40,326 --> 01:09:42,966
You can’t take that.
You have no idea what it’s gonna do.

668
01:09:43,129 --> 01:09:47,669
You know what? That is kind of the least of my concerns right now. You want some?

669
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,536
No.

670
01:09:54,374 --> 01:09:55,580
Whoa.

671
01:09:56,976 --> 01:09:58,080
Are you okay?

672
01:10:01,581 --> 01:10:03,754
Yeah. I'm good.

673
01:10:04,217 --> 01:10:05,628
Let's go.

674
01:10:08,588 --> 01:10:11,501
- How much further?
- - We're almost there.

675
01:10:11,724 --> 01:10:14,295
Hey, will you talk to me?
I'm falling asleep.

676
01:10:15,662 --> 01:10:17,403
Yeah. What do you wanna talk about?;0]

677
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:21,441
I don't know.

678
01:10:21,835 --> 01:10:23,109
What's your favorite color?

679
01:10:25,739 --> 01:10:27,446
Blue.

680
01:10:35,115 --> 01:10:38,460
Look, if you really wanna talk,
how come over the last couple years...

681
01:10:38,618 --> 01:10:41,861
...every time I've invited you cut,
you've just never shown up?

682
01:10:43,022 --> 01:10:46,265
I don't know if you've noticed,
but I don't exactly fit in.

683
01:10:51,297 --> 01:10:54,005
Okay, look,
if we survive the next 24 hours...

684
01:10:54,167 --> 01:10:56,841
...then I'll take you cut on a real date.

685
01:11:00,606 --> 01:11:02,677
Well, what if I say no?

686
01:11:03,877 --> 01:11:05,982
Well, why don't you sleep on it?

687
01:11:20,793 --> 01:11:23,330
You okay?
-I'm fine.

688
01:11:24,430 --> 01:11:26,034
Come on.

689
01:11:29,202 --> 01:11:31,204
I saw him. He was right there.

690
01:11:32,872 --> 01:11:34,783
We gotta go. Come on.

691
01:11:49,322 --> 01:11:51,097
This is it.

692
01:11:52,358 --> 01:11:54,497
This is the school.

693
01:12:27,994 --> 01:12:29,166
-- No!
- Heh-heh-heh.

694
01:12:29,329 --> 01:12:30,535
Are you okay?

695
01:12:33,933 --> 01:12:35,537
I don't know what's real anymore.

696
01:12:35,935 --> 01:12:37,573
Come on.

697
01:12:38,571 --> 01:12:40,346
Follow me.

698
01:13:09,802 --> 01:13:12,043
Hey, give me your lighter.

699
01:13:19,746 --> 01:13:22,317
All right, well, now that we're here,
now what?

700
01:13:23,015 --> 01:13:25,427
Because I don't remember any cf this.

701
01:13:30,390 --> 01:13:31,425
This must be his room.

702
01:13:33,426 --> 01:13:36,236
Okay, he brought us here for a reason.

703
01:13:37,664 --> 01:13:40,645
This is definitely his room.

704
01:13:56,249 --> 01:13:57,592
Quentin.

705
01:14:10,263 --> 01:14:13,767
-What?
-There's something back there.

706
01:14:54,707 --> 01:14:56,243
I've been here before.

707
01:14:56,709 --> 01:15:00,486
If you can keep a secret,
I'll take you to a special place.

708
01:16:07,413 --> 01:16:08,448
What are those?

709
01:16:11,717 --> 01:16:13,754
What are those pictures cf?

710
01:16:14,987 --> 01:16:16,489
They're all cf you.

711
01:16:18,958 --> 01:16:20,904
-Let me see.
-No.

712
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:33,612
No.

713
01:16:36,576 --> 01:16:38,487
Oh, God.

714
01:16:39,278 --> 01:16:41,053
No.

715
01:16:44,584 --> 01:16:45,722
We were wrong.

716
01:16:46,686 --> 01:16:49,792
He's not after us because we lied.

717
01:16:52,325 --> 01:16:55,272
He's after us because we told the truth.

718
01:16:56,329 --> 01:16:59,776
He brought us here so we would
remember what he did to us

719
01:17:01,133 --> 01:17:02,840
God. Fuck!

720
01:17:06,572 --> 01:17:08,245
Fuck.

721
01:17:10,910 --> 01:17:14,016
What dues he want from us?
He's never gonna stop.

722
01:17:23,522 --> 01:17:25,195
I know what we need to do.

723
01:17:26,025 --> 01:17:27,732
Come on.

724
01:17:33,599 --> 01:17:35,010
There's gotta be another way.

725
01:17:35,168 --> 01:17:37,808
If we just sit here and do nothing,
we're gonna die.

726
01:17:39,071 --> 01:17:42,917
-l should do this.
-I’m the one who pulled his sweater out.

727
01:17:43,576 --> 01:17:46,284
What if I’m the only one who can bring him out?

728
01:17:49,315 --> 01:17:52,762
Nancy, I can't let you go to sleep.
You're not gonna wake up.

729
01:17:52,919 --> 01:17:55,263
I know you won't let that happen.

730
01:17:58,891 --> 01:18:00,700
Wake me up if you see me struggle.

731
01:18:16,275 --> 01:18:19,119
Gotta believe in something, rig ht?

732
01:18:29,155 --> 01:18:30,998
I'm gonna be here when you get up.

733
01:18:31,857 --> 01:18:33,700
We're gonna make it.

734
01:20:16,562 --> 01:20:17,870
Aw, shit.

735
01:20:42,254 --> 01:20:44,928
You can't save her.

736
01:20:49,095 --> 01:20:50,904
Tag.

737
01:20:51,997 --> 01:20:53,670
You're it.

738
01:20:57,403 --> 01:20:59,212
Krueger!

739
01:21:00,272 --> 01:21:02,718
Your girlfriend's here. I'll be right back.

740
01:21:07,813 --> 01:21:09,793
One, two

741
01:21:09,949 --> 01:21:13,692
Guess who's coming for you

742
01:21:18,424 --> 01:21:20,131
Little Nancy.

743
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:23,364
Now that you caught me,
what game do you wanna play next?

744
01:21:23,529 --> 01:21:26,476
-Fuck you.
-Ooh. Sounds like fun.

745
01:21:27,633 --> 01:21:28,907
It's a little fast for me.

746
01:21:31,670 --> 01:21:33,047
How about we hang first?

747
01:21:36,075 --> 01:21:39,022
No. It's not real.

748
01:21:42,214 --> 01:21:43,716
It's real.

749
01:21:45,551 --> 01:21:47,155
I'm real.

750
01:22:48,814 --> 01:22:49,849
Boo.

751
01:23:12,271 --> 01:23:14,717
Now, how's this for a wet dream?

752
01:24:00,652 --> 01:24:02,689
Quentin, wake me up.

753
01:24:05,624 --> 01:24:06,967
This dress...

754
01:24:08,594 --> 01:24:11,200
was always one of my favorites.

755
01:24:12,231 --> 01:24:15,303
Do you remember it, Nancy?

756
01:24:16,368 --> 01:24:18,541
Of course you do.

757
01:24:19,304 --> 01:24:23,150
You remember everything now,
don't you?

758
01:24:25,411 --> 01:24:28,119
Your memories are what fuels me.

759
01:24:29,615 --> 01:24:31,959
No. Please don't.

760
01:24:33,285 --> 01:24:36,425
Your mouth says no...

761
01:24:36,789 --> 01:24:39,929
...but your body says yes.

762
01:24:40,993 --> 01:24:42,097
Mmm.

763
01:24:42,428 --> 01:24:43,964
Don't turn away.

764
01:24:44,129 --> 01:24:45,335
Look at me!

765
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:50,505
Look what you did to me.

766
01:24:55,908 --> 01:24:59,321
Now it's time to play.

767
01:25:09,822 --> 01:25:11,699
Are you having fun?

768
01:25:19,365 --> 01:25:21,003
Naughty girl.

769
01:25:27,005 --> 01:25:28,382
You can't hurt me.

770
01:25:29,008 --> 01:25:31,215
You're in my world.

771
01:25:34,446 --> 01:25:36,016
And you can't ever leave.

772
01:25:47,059 --> 01:25:48,265
Ohh....

773
01:25:49,428 --> 01:25:51,965
That's music to my ears.

774
01:25:52,130 --> 01:25:54,804
I wanna wake up!

775
01:25:54,967 --> 01:25:56,571
You can't wake up.

776
01:25:56,735 --> 01:26:01,809
I had to keep you awake long enough
so when you finally slept...

777
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:05,847
...you'd never wake up again.

778
01:26:07,946 --> 01:26:09,926
Nancy, wake up.

779
01:26:10,082 --> 01:26:11,686
Wake up, Nancy, wake up!

780
01:26:11,850 --> 01:26:14,490
We’re gonna be in here a long time.

781
01:26:15,821 --> 01:26:18,358
-Nancy, please!
-Did you really think your boyfriend...

782
01:26:18,524 --> 01:26:21,334
-...could wake you up?
-Please, don't do this!

783
01:26:21,493 --> 01:26:23,268
Please!

784
01:26:23,429 --> 01:26:25,670
I'm your boyfriend now.

785
01:26:27,266 --> 01:26:30,179
Nancy, come back! Please, wake up!

786
01:26:30,336 --> 01:26:31,872
You promised!

787
01:26:43,749 --> 01:26:45,422
Sweet dreams.

788
01:26:59,164 --> 01:27:00,404
Quentin, get him.

789
01:27:14,379 --> 01:27:17,656
Die! Fucking bastard!

790
01:27:22,988 --> 01:27:24,399
Nice try, Nancy.

791
01:27:24,556 --> 01:27:26,229
Now let me take a stab.

792
01:27:39,004 --> 01:27:42,918
Now, why don't you just fucking die?

793
01:27:50,315 --> 01:27:52,295
It hurts, doesn't it?

794
01:27:52,451 --> 01:27:54,522
That's because you're
in my world now, bitch.

795
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:29,724
Wait.

796
01:29:06,325 --> 01:29:09,898
- Give me some slack.
- - Yeah, aim it up a little higher.

797
01:29:11,530 --> 01:29:12,873
No sign of a body anywhere.

798
01:29:38,323 --> 01:29:40,360
Hey, Quentin.

799
01:29:43,462 --> 01:29:45,738
Nightmare’s over.

800
01:30:10,622 --> 01:30:13,159
I want you to go
straight up to bed, okay?

801
01:30:13,325 --> 01:30:14,861
Yeah.

802
01:30:18,764 --> 01:30:20,471
Hey, Mum?

803
01:30:21,366 --> 01:30:25,473
I know you were just trying
to protect me. Thank you.

804
01:30:27,739 --> 01:30:28,979
I'm just glad you're safe.
