1
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,951
<i>All my life, I've lived
and worked in the big city,</i>

2
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:23,452
<i>which, now that I think of it,
is kind of a problem,</i>

3
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:26,751
<i>since I always feel
uncomfortable around crowds.</i>

4
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:29,621
<i>I mean it. I have this fear
of enclosed spaces.</i>

5
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:32,503
<i>I-I-I... Everything makes me
feel trapped all the time.</i>

6
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:36,252
<i>I always tell myself there's gotta be
something better out there.</i>

7
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,633
<i>But maybe I...
Maybe I think too much.</i>

8
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:43,552
<i>I think everything must go back to the
fact that I had a very anxious childhood.</i>

9
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,809
You know, my mother
never had time for me.

10
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:50,984
When you're the middle child
in a family of five million,

11
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:53,026
you don't get any attention.

12
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,274
I mean, how is it possible?

13
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:58,866
I've always had these abandonment issues
which plague me.

14
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,535
My father was basically a drone,
like I've said.

15
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:04,615
And, you know, the guy flew away
when I was just a larva.

16
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:10,913
And my job, don't get me started on,
because it really annoys me.

17
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:14,374
I-I was not cut out to be a worker,
I'll tell you right now.

18
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:17,006
I-I-I feel physically inadequate.

19
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:20,384
My whole life,
I've never been able to lift

20
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,466
more than 10 times my own body weight.

21
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:27,103
And, when you get down to it,
handling dirt is, you know...

22
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:29,556
is not my idea of a rewarding career.

23
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:33,856
It's this whole gung ho,
superorganism thing

24
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:36,688
that... that, you know, I can't get.

25
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:38,239
I try, but I don't get it.

26
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,066
I mean, you know, I'm... What is it?

27
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,152
I'm supposed to do everything
for the colony.

28
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,988
And-And what about my needs?
What about me?

29
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:48,412
I've gotta believe there's someplace
out there that's better than this.

30
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,669
Otherwise, I would just curl up
in a larval position and weep.

31
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,832
The whole system makes me feel...

32
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,339
insignificant.

33
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:00,844
Excellent.

34
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,298
- You've made a real breakthrough.
- I have?

35
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:06,176
Yes, Z. You are insignificant.

36
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,476
I-I am?

37
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,278
Ground floor!

38
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:50,146
Uh, worker.

39
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:53,983
Soldier.

40
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:56,643
Ooh.

41
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,236
- Uh-oh.
- Worker.

42
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,161
Let's try it again.

43
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:14,081
Firm grip. Swing hard.
Back straight. Concentrate.

44
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:15,588
Follow through.

45
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,614
Okay. I gotta keep a positive attitude.

46
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,569
A good attitude, even though
I'm utterly insignificant.

47
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,865
I'm-I'm insignificant, um,
but with attitude.

48
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:56,540
Ooh, sorry, Z.
I didn't see ya.

49
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,996
Great, Azteca.

50
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,797
It's working already.
I'm so meaningless, I'm invisible.

51
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,961
Now, you're getting it.

52
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:08,966
After all, it's not about you.

53
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,926
It's about us! The team!

54
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,974
It's about... this.

55
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,353
Uh, a giant hole in the ground?

56
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:22,312
- Okay, people. Are we feeling good?
- Yeah!

57
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,980
- Yeah.
- Great!

58
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:29,573
Now, R-1734 through Z-7829,
you guys are on wrecking ball.

59
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,700
- You got it!
- Swell.

60
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,885
- You got it!
- All right. Swing time.

61
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:35,957
Let's get physical!
I love this job! Let's go!

62
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,752
Now, remember, Azteca, "Be the ball."

63
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,751
That's the main thing.
Now, remember that.

64
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,174
You know, gotta be one with the ball.

65
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,842
Would you cut it out already?

66
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:48,505
Jeez. I love my work. And you, well...

67
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,423
You think too much.

68
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:55,011
Come on, Z.
Help us build a bigger, better colony.

69
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,688
And, for cryin' out loud,
try to be happy about it.

70
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,065
Sure, you know. I mean, why-why...

71
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:03,019
How could I possibly be unhappy
being a piece of construction equipment?

72
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:05,856
- Okay, workers, remember...
- Here it comes.

73
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:08,358
...be the ball!

74
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,236
Let the energy flow through you!

75
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:17,788
Grin and bear it. This is...
This is for the colony.

76
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,004
Ow. This is...

77
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,127
This is just a lawsuit waiting to happen.

78
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:27,381
Hang on. Here we go. Higher! Faster!

79
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,508
Did I happen to mention that
heights make me nauseous?

80
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:31,464
No.

81
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:32,558
This is a ball!

82
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:36,302
Hey!

83
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:47,355
- Oh, Z.
- Yes. Yes. I understand.

84
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:48,565
I dropped the ball.

85
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,445
Workers. They're weak.

86
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:58,037
They lack discipline.
They lack commitment.

87
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:01,794
General, I know there's been
a glitch or two.

88
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:05,464
But everybody is working
full tilt as it is, and...

89
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,544
You can't help it, it's your nature.

90
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,928
But in spite of your limitations,

91
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:14,758
you are going to finish this tunnel
on schedule.

92
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,642
Come hell or high water.

93
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,435
From now on, anyone who falls behind

94
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,888
is going to have to explain themselves
to Colonel Cutter.

95
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:25,477
And let me assure you, the Colonel is not
as understanding as I am.

96
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:26,779
Dismissed.

97
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:33,026
Four more days, Cutter. Four more days.

98
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:37,197
And we can bid final farewell
to their kind of incompetence.

99
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,290
Yes, sir.

100
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:39,661
A fresh start.

101
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:43,460
- Imagine it!
- A strong colony, sir.

102
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,959
A colony we can be proud of.

103
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:47,460
Yes, but we're not there yet.

104
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:53,300
Cutter, we just got word that
a termite army has mobilized against us.

105
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,390
Against us?

106
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:58,935
We'll have to send troops deep into
hostile territory to attack their colony.

107
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,638
Attack a termite colony, sir?
That's suicide.

108
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,315
Exactly. Do you have the list I asked for?

109
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:06,938
Yes, General.

110
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:11,189
These are the units loyal to the queen.

111
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:13,951
Hm.

112
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,781
Then they're the ones we'll be sending.

113
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:18,746
It's a shame.
There are some fine officers here.

114
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,414
Don't we need the queen's approval
to declare war?

115
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,994
Our very next stop, Cutter.

116
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:30,504
General, we've been at peace
with that colony for years.

117
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,760
- Why would they attack us?
- They want our land.

118
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:36,384
They're desperate
for more foraging territory.

119
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:39,137
Perhaps they think
we've grown soft or weak.

120
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,012
Why don't we dispatch an ambassador,
negotiate a new treaty?

121
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,269
Certainly, we don't need to send soldiers.

122
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,600
Believe me.

123
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:50,528
Every ant in this colony
is so precious to me.

124
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:56,116
That's why we must strike now,
while we have the element of surprise.

125
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:59,453
If the termite shock troops
enter our colony, well...

126
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:03,499
Yes, General,
I know what they can do to us.

127
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:06,793
Very well.

128
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,496
You've made a wise decision.

129
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:12,091
In fact, you've insured
the future of this colony.

130
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:15,929
Hello, General.

131
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:21,138
Princess Bala. What a nice surprise.

132
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,093
You look lovelier each time I see you.

133
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,730
Thanks.

134
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,899
I hope you're not just here on business.

135
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,977
Oh, of course...
Of course not.

136
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:36,612
Because, um, it might be nice
if we had a conversation

137
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,609
once before we get married.

138
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,069
You're absolutely right.

139
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:43,031
Cutter, schedule some private time
for me and Princess Bala.

140
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:47,535
Uh, in fact, sir, there is time right now
for a personal moment.

141
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:49,916
We're a few seconds ahead of schedule.

142
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,089
Excellent. Princess.

143
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:56,840
Well, a few seconds isn't much, but

144
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,342
I guess if it's quality time...

145
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,263
So, how was your day?

146
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:06,224
- Anything interesting happen?
- We declared war.

147
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:08,272
Declared war?

148
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:11,768
Boy, talk about a rough day.

149
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:15,980
Sir, I hate to interrupt,
but time stands still for no ant.

150
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,282
Princess.

151
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:27,875
Mom, could you remind me,
why am I marrying this guy?

152
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,795
Bala, do we have to argue
about this again?

153
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:35,041
We don't seem to have
anything in common. The guy's a stiff.

154
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,424
Yes, darling. I know the General
may be a little gruff,

155
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:41,347
and somewhat overbearing at times,

156
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:44,425
but I know that he cares about you.

157
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,181
He's just not particularly good
at showing it.

158
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:51,891
But you should have seen how persistently
he asked for your hand in marriage.

159
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,226
But why me?

160
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,811
Because you're the one
who has to continue my work.

161
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,772
It's your place, dear.

162
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:02,777
- What if I don't like my place?
- Everyone has their place, Bala:

163
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,871
you, the soldiers, the workers.

164
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,033
Now, it's not all that bad
being princess, is it?

165
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,873
Would you prefer to be
carting around dirt all day?

166
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:14,000
Oh, Mother, don't be so dramatic.

167
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:19,668
At least, they seem to have some fun
every now and then.

168
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,468
- Two aphid beers.
- Why'd I have to be born a worker?

169
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:31,809
You soldiers get all the glory,
plus you get to go out in the world.

170
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,187
You meet interesting insects,
you get to kill them.

171
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:35,397
Yeah.

172
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,944
But you get to spend all day with those...

173
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,652
beautiful worker girls.

174
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:44,694
Weaver, they're career girls.
They're obsessed with digging.

175
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,407
I really don't think I'm ever gonna meet
the right girl for me.

176
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,288
Who said a girl for you?
I was talking about a girl for me.

177
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,086
Don't you want your aphid beer?

178
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,026
Call me crazy, but...

179
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,088
I have a thing about drinking
from the anus of another creature. Okay?

180
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:01,385
Suit yourself.

181
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,257
Ah! Me, I'm cuttin' loose.

182
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,391
We got royal inspection comin' up.

183
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:11,266
Inspection, meaning you're gonna
stand around like an idiot

184
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:13,393
while a bunch of blue bloods smirk at you.

185
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,544
I don't know how you put up with it,
Weaver.

186
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,436
Z, I've known you for a long time. Right?

187
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,896
Definitely. You were born
two seconds after me.

188
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,949
Yeah. And ever since we were little,
I've been listenin' to you complain.

189
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:26,027
What are you bitching about?

190
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,908
In case you haven't noticed,
we ants are running the show.

191
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,489
We're the lords of the Earth.

192
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,246
Hey. Don't talk to me about earth, okay?

193
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,419
'Cause I just spent all day
hauling it around.

194
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:39,799
There's just gotta be a better place.

195
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:43,636
There is. I've been there.

196
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:46,631
I'm sor... I'm sorry.
Were you talking to me?

197
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,636
There is a better place.

198
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,597
Insectopia.

199
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:55,853
Oh, really. Lunatic at 3:00.

200
00:12:56,192 --> 00:13:00,106
You can't understand until you go there
and see it for yourself.

201
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,021
You can be your own ant there.

202
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,608
The streets are paved with food.

203
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,027
Nobody tellin' you what to do.

204
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:11,114
No wars. No colony.

205
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,369
- I shoulda never left.
- Oh, yeah. Fascinating.

206
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:20,126
We were on a long-range recon.
I got cut off from my unit.

207
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:23,876
Nothing like a little post-traumatic
stress disorder to make your day complete.

208
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,804
- Then I saw it! Insectopia!
- Hey!

209
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,805
You head towards the monolith.

210
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:32,180
Ten clicks past the great canyons
to the land of red and white!

211
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:35,229
Hey, gramps.
You've had enough for one night.

212
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,435
Come on. Before you get in trouble.

213
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,062
Head for the monolith! Listen to me!

214
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,153
The monolith!

215
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,313
That guy's got a screw loose.

216
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,990
- Cross the lake!
- Insectopia.

217
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,151
Wouldn't it be great if it were that easy?

218
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:53,455
- Yeah. Dream on, Z.
- Cross the lake!

219
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,699
Look for the land of red and white!

220
00:13:57,003 --> 00:14:01,998
Wow! This is so... gritty.

221
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:05,506
Ten minutes and we're out of here.
Right? This place is off-limits.

222
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:08,258
Just blame it on me.
Say it was all my idea.

223
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:09,884
It is all your idea.

224
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:13,263
Besides, no one's gonna recognize us.

225
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,269
Come on, girls. What do you say?

226
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,181
Let's take a walk on the wild side.

227
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:23,311
<i>Okay, everybody.
6:15. Time to dance.</i>

228
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,193
- Time to cut a rug, Z.
- Oh, no. That's okay.

229
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:30,367
I'm gonna leave the rug
just the way it is, Weaver.

230
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:43,918
Step back, ladies.

231
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:47,426
I'm gonna ask one of these workers
to dance with me.

232
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:48,804
Oh.

233
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,223
What a bunch of losers.

234
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:56,973
Mindless zombies capitulating
to an oppressive system.

235
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:58,975
Hi. Wanna dance?

236
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:01,148
Absolutely.

237
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:03,527
Follow me.

238
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:08,071
So, how come I haven't seen you
around here before?

239
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,156
Oh, I don't get out much.

240
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,826
I, uh, I work over at the palace.

241
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:16,246
Oh, the palace, huh?
I bet those royals really live it up.

242
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,662
Course they're all a little,
you know, from inbreeding.

243
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:20,752
What?

244
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:25,424
Yowch!

245
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:28,918
Ya-ya-yowch!

246
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:31,138
Yowch.

247
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:38,181
- Yowch.
- What on earth are you doing?

248
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:42,265
Well, actually, to tell you the truth,
I'm sort of making it up.

249
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:43,942
Really?

250
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,109
Why does everybody have to dance
the same way?

251
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:49,359
You know, that's completely boring.
It's... It's monotonous.

252
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,486
It's no fun.

253
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,598
Hey. Watch your step, worker.

254
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:26,399
You watch yours, buddy,
or you'll be in big trouble.

255
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:29,604
Th-Th-That's okay.
I'll... I'm gonna let him off this time.

256
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,903
What? Are you crazy?
This guy's built like a pebble.

257
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,733
Aren't you even gonna defend yourself?

258
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,489
Hey, buddy. Get back in place.

259
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:41,786
- Me? Uh... Uh...
- What if he doesn't want to?

260
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:45,877
Yeah.
What if I don't like my place?

261
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,296
- What's he talkin' about?
- We got us a troublemaker.

262
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,418
Buckle up, Spanky.

263
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:53,219
This one goes out
to all the lazy workers.

264
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,048
You ought to watch that
aggressive behavior, buddy.

265
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,259
He's just a worker.

266
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,657
- Take it outside!
- Come on!

267
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:23,703
Princess Bala! Princess Bala!
The guards are coming.

268
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,790
- Let's get outta here.
- Wait! Wait!

269
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,549
Princess? You're a princess?

270
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,752
Uh, I gotta go.

271
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:37,758
- When can I see you again?
- Let me think.

272
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:40,225
Never.

273
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,263
- Bye.
- No. Wait!

274
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:51,227
<i>♪ What a day it has been ♪</i>

275
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,063

279
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,618
<i>♪ Why, it's almost like being in love ♪</i>

280
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:20,307
Yowch.

281
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:40,192
- Can I get you another one, pal?
- No, thanks.

282
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:44,075
- I think I'm gonna go.
- Yeah. I don't blame you.

283
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:47,749
It's always slow in here the night
before one of those royal reviews.

284
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,873
I guess the soldiers need their shut-eye
before they meet the queen.

285
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,171
- I don't blame ya.
- That's it!

286
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,757
You know, I was once...

287
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,510
See ya.

288
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,134
Psst. Weaver.

289
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,393
I figured it out! Weaver. Weaver!

290
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:11,564
What? What?

291
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,451
I got a great idea.

292
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:17,813
You gotta switch places with me. Let me go
to the inspection instead of you.

293
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:21,818
- What time is it?
- Weaver. The royal family will be there.

294
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,826
This is the only way I can see her.

295
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:27,121
- See who?
- Princess Bala.

296
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:28,574
Are you nuts?

297
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,334
You want me to switch places with you?

298
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:34,249
Do you know how much trouble
you can get into

299
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,753
for even talkin' about
impersonatin' a soldier?

300
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:38,800
You can get in trouble just for listenin'

301
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,424
to someone talkin' about
impersonatin' a soldier.

302
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,047
You have to help me.

303
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:48,055
If I can't see her again,
my life is just not worth living.

304
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,521
Pl-Pl-Please, Weaver. Please.

305
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:55,108
Switch jobs with me just for a day.

306
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,696
Th-Think of all the things
that I've done for you.

307
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:00,443
Mm-hmm. I can't think of any.

308
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:04,610
Okay. So, think of all the things
that I'm gonna do for you.

309
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:08,788
Would I meet some worker girls?

310
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:12,333
Are you kidding?
They always go after the new guy.

311
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,082
It's like a sport for them!

312
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,955
And-And believe me,
they will definitely go for

313
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,881
an adorable little insect like you.

314
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:19,968
Mm-hmm.

315
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:23,636
Weaver, I... I have to see her again.

316
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:28,054
Z, what kind of chance
do you have with a princess?

317
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:31,519
I mean, she probably
won't even remember you.

318
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:35,557
I... I know it sounds nuts.

319
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,401
But I have to try.

320
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,813
Oh, boy.

321
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:45,238
Princess, fancy meeting you here.

322
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,161
What do you say we lose this crowd?

323
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:53,458
Oh, me? You know, I... I wear many hats.

324
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:56,036
I guess you'd have to call me
a Renaissance ant.

325
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:57,663
Eyes right!

326
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:05,595
- Beautiful! Just beautiful!
- Mm.

327
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:09,425
The precision. The order.

328
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:13,519
Princess Bala! Princess Bala!
Hey. It's me.

329
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,347
Remember Z from the bar?

330
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:18,855
Princess Bala! Princess Bala! Princess...

331
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,152
Bala, you must encourage the troops.

332
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:22,822
Wave.

333
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:27,781
Oh. She sees me!
Excuse me, guys. I-I... I'm sorry.

334
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,112
I just got a better offer.
Could you excu...

335
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:31,742
Company halt!

336
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:36,914
Princess!

337
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,793
- Princess Bala!
- Quiet there! Get back in rank.

338
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:45,924
- You new, kid?
- Oh, yes, but I'm gettin' out soon.

339
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:48,050
I-I got a trial membership.

340
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,633
Trial membership.
That's a good one!

341
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:54,345
- Name's Barbatus.
- Z.

342
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,430
- Right face!
- Psst!

343
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:09,156
Sacrifice. To some, it is just a word.

344
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,070
To others, it is a code!

345
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,872
Jeez. I'm bad at word games.

346
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:18,077
A soldier knows that the life
of an individual ant doesn't matter.

347
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,374
What matters is the colony.

348
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:24,507
He's willing to live for the colony,
to fight for the colony,

349
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,092
to die for the colony.

350
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:29,717
- This guy's crazy.
- I hear ya.

351
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:34,268
At 0800 hours, we received word
that the termite enemy has mobilized.

352
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:38,146
We have no choice but to launch
a preemptive strike.

353
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,686
You are the queen's finest.

354
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,109
I know you will all do your duty.

355
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,688
I am proud to send you into battle.

356
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,365
Into... I'm sor... I'm sorry, into battle?

357
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:53,286
- Dismissed.
- Left face. Forward march.

358
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,782
You know, I think there's been
a terrible mistake.

359
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:59,869
You know, the truth is I just...
I just came for the speech.

360
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:02,545
Don't worry, kid. I'll watch out for ya.

361
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,680
Sound off!

362
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:11,759
- One!
- Two!

363
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:12,965
Sound off!

364
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,139
- Three!
- Huh?

365
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,137
Sound off!

366
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,308
- Five!
- Six!

367
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,431
- Seven!
- Eight!

368
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:18,521
- Nine!
- Ten!

369
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:19,767
- Eleven!
- Twelve!

370
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:20,938
- Thirteen!
- Fourteen!

371
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:26,437
<i>♪ We ants go marching one by one
Hurrah, hurrah! ♪</i>

372
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:30,319
<i>♪ We slaughter termites just for fun
Hurrah, hurrah! ♪</i>

373
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,571
So, these termites, they're-they're...

374
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:36,325
These guys are not going to put up much of
a fight? We're talkin' pushovers, right?

375
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:39,328
Not really, kid.
They're five times our size.

376
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,498
And they shoot acid from their foreheads.

377
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,249
Hey! Keep it movin', shorty!

378
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:48,209
<i>♪ We ants go marching two by two
Hurrah, hurrah! ♪</i>

379
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:52,672
<i>♪ We'll all be dead before we're through
Hurrah, hurrah ♪</i>

380
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:56,179
Say, what exactly does our platoon do?

381
00:23:56,268 --> 00:24:00,512
I mean, will we be serving beverages
or processing paperwork?

382
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:04,190
Our platoon has the best assignment
of all! We're the first into battle.

383
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:08,236
<i>♪ We ants go marching three by three
Hurrah, hurrah! ♪</i>

384
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:10,609
<i>♪ Hurrah, hurrah! ♪</i>

385
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:15,027
<i>♪ We're off to face our destiny
Hurrah, hurrah! ♪</i>

386
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,033
Hey. Wait a minute. Let's not get...
We're being too hasty here.

387
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:21,241
These... These guys sound like bruisers.

388
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:23,247
Just how were you figuring
on beating them?

389
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:25,249
Superior numbers, kid!

390
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:28,214
Overwhelm their defenses
and kill their queen!

391
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:32,211
Hey, fellas. You're being
a little extreme, I feel.

392
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:35,217
Why don't we try and influence
their political process

393
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,048
with campaign contributions?

394
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:40,726
I like you, kid!
You got a sense of humor.

395
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:44,727
- Forward!
- Come on. Let's kick some termite butt!

396
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:46,809
Over the top!

397
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:53,482
Yeeow!

398
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:00,739
Yee-haw!

399
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:20,801
- Where is everyone?
- Something's not right.

400
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,391
Don't be scared, kid.

401
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,319
They're here!

402
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:36,571
Attack!

403
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:00,892
Come on.

404
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:19,739
Barbatus, you saved my life.

405
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,740
Ah, don't get all sappy about it.

406
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:32,372
Hey, guys. Look out behind you!

407
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:42,390
Hey. Hey, guys?

408
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:45,267
Can somebody help me here?
Can anybody... Hey.

409
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:00,451
Yeah.

410
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:05,121
Okay, mama.

411
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:06,916
Yeah!

412
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:11,411
Oh, yeah. Big guy comin' through.

413
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:15,464
Love it.

414
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:24,174
Hey. Hey. Hey. Take it easy, muscles.

415
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,469
You're makin' the rest of us look bad.

416
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:30,480
What happened to Z?

417
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:34,647
He's takin' a personal day,
so I'm fillin' in.

418
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:37,567
You fill in any more, and you'll explode.

419
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,361
Eh, you got a problem?

420
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:47,322
No, um...

421
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:48,976
Nobody told me digging was so much fun.

422
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:52,290
You know, you pick the dirt up.
You move it.

423
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:56,714
You pick it up again.
You move it again. Lots of reps.

424
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,042
You exercise the arms and the thorax.

425
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:01,344
Yes, I... I see what you mean.

426
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:04,173
- Mm. Yeah. That is fascinating.
- Sorry, sir.

427
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,682
I was just havin' a little chat
with my friend, sir.

428
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:10,519
You know, I just had a little chat
with General Mandible.

429
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:15,100
Anybody who doesn't meet his quota
is going to be downsized.

430
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:16,560
Come on. Cut him a break.

431
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:19,197
He's new.

432
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,740
Hey.

433
00:28:21,158 --> 00:28:24,447
What do you say we help
your attitude a little bit

434
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:28,155
by taking away your rations
for the day?

435
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:30,458
Thanks for your time.

436
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,373
I don't know what came over me.

437
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:35,749
Talking back like that.

438
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:38,049
I must be losin' it.

439
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,545
Sorry I got you in trouble.

440
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:44,300
But, listen, you can...
share my rations. Whoa.

441
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,389
If you want.

442
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:49,517
Are you askin' me out to dinner?

443
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:53,096
Oh, no. I... Well...

444
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,475
If you don't have anything else planned.

445
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,901
I'll check my calendar.

446
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,780
You know...

447
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,153
I'm kinda glad Z's takin' a breather.

448
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:37,566
Kid!

449
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,726
Kid, over here.

450
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:43,446
Barbatus.

451
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:47,609
Be honest, kid. Am I hurt bad?

452
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:52,326
N-No. N-Not at all. You're...
Actually, you're lookin' terrific.

453
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:55,750
You got, you know,
swell color in your cheeks.

454
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:59,454
No. I can see it in your eyes.

455
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:01,790
I'm a goner.

456
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:04,593
Help me up, Z.

457
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:10,965
Oh! I can't feel my legs.

458
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:15,770
You gotta hang in there, buddy.
I know you're gonna make it.

459
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:18,690
Just take... take deep breaths.

460
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:21,643
Because I'm gonna try and find your body.

461
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:25,697
It's bound to be out there somewhere...

462
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:35,824
Barbatus, hang on.

463
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:41,747
- Barbatus...
- Don't make my mistake, kid.

464
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,166
Don't follow orders your whole life.

465
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:48,423
Think for yourself.

466
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:55,351
Barbatus.

467
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:11,323
<i>We're on schedule.</i>

468
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:14,204
Work is completed on "A" section, sir.

469
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,371
We're clearing a path
through "D" section now.

470
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:19,792
We need to push harder, Cutter.
I want double shifts around-the-clock.

471
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,791
- We can't afford to let up. Is that clear?
- Crystal, sir.

472
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,214
Good. What about section...

473
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,507
Excuse me, sir.

474
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:28,463
This had better be important.

475
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,385
Well, it's about the termite battle, sir.

476
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:35,722
The enemy was destroyed, but I'm afraid
it was a disaster for our troops, as well.

477
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:38,974
Well, that's terrible. Terrible!

478
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:42,812
There is a bit of good news, sir.
One soldier did make it back.

479
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,642
- No kidding?
- What did you say?

480
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,477
Word is spreading through the colony, sir.

481
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,984
The queen requested a meeting
with the war hero.

482
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:52,567
Damn! Good.
Damn good.

483
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:53,902
Uh, I'll handle this.

484
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,325
Congratulations, soldier.

485
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:04,913
Well, you're a little short
for a war hero, aren't you?

486
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:06,456
A war hero?

487
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:11,173
Sir. I don't actually think
that I'm a hero.

488
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,129
Good. I don't like heroes.

489
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:15,423
But, sir. You don't understand.

490
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,520
I... I didn't do anything.

491
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:29,650
I mean, it was all horrible.
It was just a massacre.

492
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:32,026
A massacre upon a massacre.

493
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:34,609
That's good, soldier. Now, wave.

494
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:44,085
There was nothing you could do, Weaver.

495
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:46,625
You didn't know they were going to war.

496
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:48,873
I just feel horrible.

497
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:53,011
Poor Z. I should have never let him go.

498
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:56,221
Wait a minute. That's no soldier.

499
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:57,640
That's Z!

500
00:32:58,018 --> 00:32:59,018
Z?

501
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:02,144
The little guy made it!

502
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,350
Let's go, soldier.

503
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:20,621
As I was saying, son,
you are an ant after my own heart.

504
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:23,958
An ant that looks Death
in the face and laughs.

505
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:26,918
Well, actually, the truth is,

506
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,418
I generally just make
belittling comments

507
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:31,465
and snicker behind Death's back.

508
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:34,506
General Mandible!

509
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:39,264
Keep your comments to yourself.

510
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:40,808
Let me do the talking.

511
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,853
May I present Her Majesty, the Queen.

512
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:54,238
Charmed. Charmed.

513
00:33:54,324 --> 00:33:56,281
And the Royal Princess Bala.

514
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,069
Welcome home, soldier.

515
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:04,453
We cannot begin to express our gratitude
for your heroic efforts.

516
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:07,536
The private has asked me to convey
his most humble appreciation.

517
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:10,713
Please. Please. It was nothing really.

518
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:13,462
Just your average run-of-the-mill valor

519
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:16,135
and extraordinary courageousness,
you know.

520
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:19,464
In the heat of battle,
there's very little time to think.

521
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:22,972
One must attack! Attack! Attack!

522
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,474
Well, indeed.

523
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:29,148
As you can see, Your Highness,
the battlefield is fresh in his mind.

524
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:31,100
So, begging your pardon,

525
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:34,153
but this is the perfect time
to debrief the private.

526
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:37,653
Oh, please, General.
Not on our first date.

527
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:40,071
Not on our first date.

528
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:42,495
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?

529
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:45,824
Well, maybe. And then again, maybe not.

530
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,749
And then... then again.

531
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:49,584
Yowch.

532
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:52,288
That's it! You're the guy from the bar.

533
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:55,170
- Don't! Shh!
- "Bar"? What bar?

534
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:58,503
I danced with this guy
at the bar the other night.

535
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,679
He was just a worker then.

536
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:04,221
- What were you doing at a bar?
- Precisely what I want to know.

537
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:06,348
No. This isn't about me.

538
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:09,101
I mean, look at this worker.
Look what he's done.

539
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:12,604
I think you're thinkin' of someone else.
After all, I am a solider.

540
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,652
Exactly. You were a worker.

541
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,855
But now, you're a war hero.

542
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:23,028
- He's a worker?
- A worker danced with my fiancée?

543
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:26,747
F-Fiancée? W-W-Wait a minute.

544
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,576
This is not how it looks.
I can explain this.

545
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:32,286
Hey. She was the one
making all the moves.

546
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,380
Arrest him.

547
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:36,716
Hey! Hey, wait a minute.
Take it easy. Can't we discuss this?

548
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,418
What are you doing? Let go of my daughter.

549
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:41,678
He's taking her hostage!

550
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:45,384
No. No. I'm not. I mean, yes, I am.

551
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:48,143
One more step and, uh,
the princess gets it.

552
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:50,937
Let go of me!

553
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:52,024
Ow!

554
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:54,482
Don't make me hurt her. Ow!

555
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:11,659
Uh.

556
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:14,370
What are you doing, you creep?

557
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:16,881
Are you out of your puny little mind?

558
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:20,084
There they are! Down there!
Let's go. Move. Move. Move.

559
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,840
Oh, good.

560
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:25,882
Here they come to rescue me and kill you.

561
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:26,761
Kill?

562
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,934
- Hey, you guys!
- Stop it. Stop it.

563
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,478
- What are you tryin' to do?
- Get off me, you little twerp!

564
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:32,667
- What do you want to do?
- Ow!

565
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:34,291
- Throw away everything we've got?
- Hey!

566
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,272
What're you waiting for?

567
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:39,729
Hello? Guys!

568
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:48,492
- Huh?
- What is it?

569
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,210
It's beautiful.

570
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:57,379
Ridgeway, get out of there!

571
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:24,694
- Oof!
- Uh!

572
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:41,837
- Oh. Don't worry. I'm okay.
- You?

573
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,418
You? You're okay?

574
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,462
Hey. Who cares about you?

575
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:48,764
- I almost died here.
- Will you please calm down?

576
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,433
You're not going to let
a little near-death experience

577
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,680
ruin your mood, are you?

578
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:56,936
Hey. This is not a mood, okay?
You're not listening to me.

579
00:37:58,735 --> 00:37:59,942
Where am I?

580
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:04,818
Look, what's-your-name.

581
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:08,868
Just climb up that tree
and find out where I am.

582
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:11,616
Look, the-the trick is not to panic.

583
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:14,449
You know, h-h-he who panics is lost.

584
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:17,285
What am I saying? We are lost.

585
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:26,753
Ow!

586
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,382
I've been kidnapped by the village idiot.

587
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:33,225
Who's the bigger idiot,

588
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:36,019
the idiot or the idiot
who gets kidnapped by the idiot?

589
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:38,392
What'd you do,
talk those termites to death?

590
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:42,147
I can't believe you tried to
pass yourself off as a soldier.

591
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:44,570
Why are you stalking me?

592
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:48,399
Don't you realize I'm out of your league?

593
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:50,359
You're the one
who was cruising the worker bar

594
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:51,614
looking for a little action.

595
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:54,071
And you just happened to find it...

596
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:58,076
the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker.

597
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:01,670
Please. I was slumming it.

598
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:03,081
Don't you get it?

599
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:07,673
I chose you because you were
the most pathetic little bug in the joint.

600
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:11,927
I was gonna let you become part
of my most erotic fantasies,

601
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:14,429
but now you can just forget that.

602
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:18,433
Write it off, you know. I guess
what you prefer is old Blood and Guts.

603
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:22,767
This guy's idea of a romantic night out
is two seats at a public execution.

604
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:26,195
Boy. You really chose the right husband.

605
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:28,193
For your information,

606
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:30,991
the General and I are deeply,

607
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:34,912
deeply in... engaged.

608
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:38,116
You come right back down here
this instant!

609
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,915
We are marching straight back
to the colony so that I...

610
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,217
The monolith!

611
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:50,715
...stupid little bug you are!

612
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:53,297
Absolutely. Wonderful.
That's an appealing offer.

613
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:58,511
But, considering the options, you go back.
Okay? 'Cause I'm going on to Insectopia.

614
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:02,390
Oh. Come on. "Insectopia"?

615
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:04,358
You're crazier than I thought.

616
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:08,904
Yeah? Well, I happen to have
it on a very reliable source.

617
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:13,697
Or... Or should I say,
a drunk, raving source?

618
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:17,871
But the point is,
I'm convinced the place definitely exists.

619
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:22,077
Stop! I order you to stop, worker!

620
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:25,584
Hey. I got a name. Okay? It's Z.

621
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,253
And out here, you can't order me around.

622
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:31,590
All right. Fine. No problem.

623
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:50,522
Worker! Worker!
Where are you?

624
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:55,072
Z? Z? Wait for me.

625
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:59,785
No more excuses, General.
I want my daughter back.

626
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:03,625
Frankly, I'm beginning to doubt
your ability to handle this.

627
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,379
Believe me, Your Highness,
we will spare no effort to bring her back.

628
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:12,092
Princess Bala is essential
to all our plans for the future.

629
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:17,719
So he kills himself a hundred termites,
gets a few medals,

630
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:21,098
then bada-bing, bada-bip,
bags himself the princess.

631
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:23,600
He looks him dead in the eye
and says, "Bite me."

632
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,852
He said that to General Mandible?

633
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:28,559
Buddy. Hey, hey, buddy.

634
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:31,233
You heard about the war hero named Z?

635
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:33,363
Runs off with the princess, right?

636
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:38,114
When they sent the guards after him,
he just looks at 'em and boom!

637
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:42,414
- They burst into flames.
- Z? You talkin' about Z?

638
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,457
Hey, I know the guy.
He's a friend of mine.

639
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:45,910
I think your information...

640
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:50,169
- You know Z?
- Yeah. He's a worker. He used to dig here.

641
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:54,673
A worker? That's impossible.
A worker can't do anything, except work.

642
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,879
Yeah. It's not like we got a choice.

643
00:41:56,973 --> 00:42:00,432
We do have a choice.
Uh, I mean, look at Z.

644
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,760
He decided he wanted something,
and he went for it.

645
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:03,935
He's not alone.

646
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:07,106
I used to be a soldier,
and I switched places with him.

647
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:10,605
Wait a second. You're tellin' me
I don't have to be here?

648
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:11,856
We've got a choice?

649
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:15,453
The authorities don't want you
to know about it,

650
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,344
but we don't have to work
on the tunnel anymore.

651
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,530
It's the workers who control
the means of production.

652
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,782
If Z don't dig, I don't dig.

653
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:23,990
People, what is this?
An encounter group?

654
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:27,243
- Let's get back to work.
- Why?

655
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:31,626
...on the tunnel anymore!
This guy, Z, he's leadin' the revolution!

656
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:34,178
I'll... get back to you.

657
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:45,810
Think about it, Z. Two ants.

658
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:51,392
Who ever heard of two ants?
Two million ants, maybe. But two?

659
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:57,231
Look, I'm hungry, I'm thirsty,

660
00:42:57,617 --> 00:43:00,360
and this whole desert thing?

661
00:43:01,454 --> 00:43:02,865
It just doesn't work for me.

662
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:06,449
- Yada, yada, yada, yada.
- I think it's about time you take me back.

663
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:08,579
Take yourself back. Sheesh.

664
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:12,914
Excuse me. You kidnapped me, remember?

665
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:16,463
That means you have
certain responsibilities.

666
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:19,511
You can't just abandon me
here in the wilderness.

667
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,884
Yeah, well, it's better than
being back at the colony.

668
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:25,434
- You're not serious, are you?
- Maybe you were living the high life,

669
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,386
but personally, this beats digging.

670
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:30,658
If you'd ever done a day's labor,
you'd know what I was talking about.

671
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:35,694
"Labor"? What do you know about labor?

672
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:38,363
How would you feel
if you were expected to give birth

673
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,941
every ten seconds
for the rest of your life?

674
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:42,619
Gee.

675
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:44,407
Water!

676
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,498
Ahh. All you think about is yourself.

677
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:54,376
Yeah? Well, nobody else
ever thought about me.

678
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:57,173
So as far as I'm concerned,
I don't need anybody else.

679
00:43:57,593 --> 00:44:01,928
Help! Help me, Bala!

680
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:08,552
Help! B-B-B-B-Bala!

681
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,558
Hold on. I'll get you out. Hold on.

682
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:13,808
Help, Ba...

683
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:37,084
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

684
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:41,340
Now, maybe we can put
this fantasy behind us

685
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:43,675
and head back to the colo...

686
00:44:44,724 --> 00:44:47,683
Oh, Z! What are you doing?

687
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:51,679
- We've gotta cross the lake.
- Am I missing something here?

688
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:53,976
Didn't we just get out of the water?

689
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,818
Bala, look, what have you got to lose?

690
00:44:58,905 --> 00:45:00,487
I mean, think about it.

691
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:04,487
Do you really want to be
Mrs. Raving Lunatic?

692
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:09,363
There's a better place.

693
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:12,537
Z, please.

694
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:15,999
Just... gimme one chance.

695
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:18,205
If we don't find Insectopia soon,

696
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:21,212
I promise I'll take you back
to the colony.

697
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,646
I hope you know what you're doing.

698
00:45:39,237 --> 00:45:40,318
Yeah, me, too.

699
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:52,490
We want Z! We want Z!

700
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,290
People, come on.

701
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:57,370
I know some ants
who aren't gonna make their quota.

702
00:45:57,672 --> 00:46:00,005
Buzz off, pawn of the oppressor.

703
00:46:00,091 --> 00:46:05,678
We want Z! We want Z!

704
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:10,341
Sorry, sir. I came as soon as I heard.
I was debriefing the trackers.

705
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:13,927
- And? What's the report?
- Well, this Z, sir.

706
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:16,013
He's one slippery character.

707
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:19,441
They lost Bala's trail
at the edge of the lake.

708
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:20,608
The lake?

709
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:24,484
<i>♪ All we are saying ♪</i>

710
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:28,112
<i>♪ Is give Z a chance ♪</i>

711
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,281
What's that soldier doing there?

712
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:34,706
It appears he's holding hands, sir,
with a worker.

713
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:37,802
I don't like the way
things are going, Cutter.

714
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,328
I'm counting on you for results.

715
00:46:41,424 --> 00:46:43,711
- Now, can I depend on you or not?
- Yes, sir.

716
00:46:43,968 --> 00:46:45,800
All right, then. Let's wrap this up.

717
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:51,924
We want Z! We want Z!

718
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:54,385
I've heard a lot about this Z.

719
00:46:56,397 --> 00:47:00,516
I even had the pleasure
of meeting him once.

720
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:03,560
But where is he now?

721
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:05,987
Can anyone point him out?

722
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:10,985
I mean, if this Z cares so much about us,

723
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:13,737
then why isn't he here?

724
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:16,831
I'll tell you why.

725
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:20,411
Because Z doesn't give a damn about us.

726
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:26,508
That's why he kidnapped our princess.
That's why he ran away.

727
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:31,714
Z is no hero. We are the heroes.

728
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:36,017
We are the ones ensuring
the future of our great colony.

729
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:40,347
And when we've completed
this magnificent structure,

730
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:42,687
we will reap the benefits:

731
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:46,107
more food and less work for everyone.

732
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:50,316
And as further reward
for your heroic efforts,

733
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:53,406
and every one of you will get the day off!

734
00:47:54,997 --> 00:48:00,584
So you can be the guests of honor
at the MegaTunnel dedication ceremonies!

735
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:09,084
Mandible! Mandible!

736
00:48:09,178 --> 00:48:12,842
Mandible! Mandible!

737
00:48:12,932 --> 00:48:15,675
Mandible! Mandible!

738
00:48:15,768 --> 00:48:17,805
Mandible! Mandible!

739
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:19,477
Now bring me that soldier.

740
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:04,432
Oh, my God! Z! Come here!

741
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:20,952
It's Insectopia!

742
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:27,792
You were right. It really is here.

743
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:43,724
- Huh?
- All right. All right!

744
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,521
- You're a genius.
- Let's eat.

745
00:49:50,613 --> 00:49:52,149
Huh.

746
00:49:58,621 --> 00:50:00,829
Well? What's the problem?

747
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:04,579
There's some kind of force field.

748
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:11,590
Uh, excuse me. Excuse me.
How do you get in?

749
00:50:14,595 --> 00:50:17,838
Yes, well, I'm afraid
this is a private function.

750
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:22,597
- Who are your friends, dear?
- Crawling insects, poopsie.

751
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:25,474
Oh! The poor dears.

752
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:29,767
Uh, good morning.

753
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:32,106
- Huh?
- Darling, really?

754
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:35,860
Greeting every insect
that emerges out of the grass?

755
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:40,240
Pardon me. I guess you don't recognize me.

756
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:47,160
I've been traveling and I'm all schlumpy.

757
00:50:47,795 --> 00:50:49,377
I'm Princess Bala.

758
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:54,375
Oh! It's even worse. They're Eurotrash.

759
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:58,299
Darling, they're poor.
They're dirty. They're smelly.

760
00:50:59,098 --> 00:51:00,680
We have to help them.

761
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:05,139
Just wait right here.
We'll fetch you a little something.

762
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:08,722
Oh, please, Muffy. Not another crusade.

763
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:13,102
Chippie, we have a social obligation
to the less fortunate.

764
00:51:14,363 --> 00:51:18,232
I know you laugh at my hobbies,
but this is important to me!

765
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:21,485
Mm. You have such a big heart.

766
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:24,780
That's why you're
my little cuddly-widdles.

767
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:29,743
Oh, my big, strong pheromone factory.

768
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:33,038
- Mm!
- Oh!

769
00:51:33,424 --> 00:51:36,758
Oh, brother.
Suddenly I've lost my appetite.

770
00:51:37,386 --> 00:51:38,843
- You know...
- Oh!

771
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:41,012
I guess I had imagined Insectopia...

772
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,307
I don't know, a little differently.

773
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,015
Oh, Muffy!

774
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:55,568
- No! Oh, no!
- Oh, no.

775
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:58,737
Look out!

776
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,656
Z, help me!

777
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:07,081
Z!

778
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:09,908
Don't let me... Don't let me go, Z.

779
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:17,123
Get me out of here!

780
00:52:22,014 --> 00:52:23,014
Bala!

781
00:52:30,773 --> 00:52:32,389
Whoa, this is not good.

782
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:40,730
Whoa!

783
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,985
Whoa-oa-oa!

784
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,772
Whoa-oa-oa!

785
00:53:27,371 --> 00:53:28,371
Hi.

786
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:37,586
- Z?
- Yes?

787
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:42,884
It looks like this is it, just when...
I was starting to like you.

788
00:53:52,855 --> 00:53:55,142
Who the hell is that?

789
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:09,746
That's enough.

790
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:13,581
I ain't tellin' you nothin'.

791
00:54:14,168 --> 00:54:19,038
Soldier, the princess is vital
to the future of this colony.

792
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:22,666
She must be returned
to take her proper place as queen.

793
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,843
We already have a queen.

794
00:54:25,304 --> 00:54:28,297
As for your friend Z,
why should I hurt him?

795
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:31,049
He's not important.

796
00:54:32,728 --> 00:54:33,764
Now, soldier,

797
00:54:34,438 --> 00:54:37,602
we all know that one individual ant
doesn't matter.

798
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:39,942
Not you...

799
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:42,443
not Cutter...

800
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:45,438
Not even her.

801
00:54:45,908 --> 00:54:48,116
Azteca!

802
00:54:48,202 --> 00:54:50,615
Don't tell that tight-ass anything,
Weaver! Ahh!

803
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:52,946
Where is Z?

804
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:54,789
I don't know where he is!

805
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,538
Hm. That's too bad.

806
00:55:05,636 --> 00:55:06,636
Wait!

807
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:08,795
Insectopia!

808
00:55:09,181 --> 00:55:12,674
Uh! I know it sounds crazy,
but that's where he'd be going.

809
00:55:12,768 --> 00:55:18,059
Soldier, you think this is a game?
Insectopia does not exist.

810
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:21,562
As a matter of fact... it does.

811
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:22,855
Sir?

812
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:24,481
I'll brief you on the coordinates.

813
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:26,729
You're gonna bring the princess back.

814
00:55:27,783 --> 00:55:30,150
And as for Z... kill him.

815
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:34,199
But you said he didn't matter.

816
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:37,953
It's for the good of the colony.
You made the right decision.

817
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:45,591
Gentlemen, now you can see
how dangerous individualism can be.

818
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:49,260
It makes us... vulnerable.

819
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:52,056
Let's go.

820
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:58,474
Take him back to the MegaTunnel.
Put him on the front line.

821
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,190
Dismissed.

822
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:14,661
Jeez, what was I thinking?
I almost got you killed.

823
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:18,702
Z, you know, you really
shouldn't be so hard on...

824
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:22,786
That's it.
I'm taking you back to the colony.

825
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,917
- Uh! Ow! Oh.
- Uh!

826
00:56:26,133 --> 00:56:30,218
- Insectopia? I must've been crazy.
- Z?

827
00:56:30,554 --> 00:56:32,637
But you know what?
I can admit it when I'm wrong.

828
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:34,305
- Z.
- And this time, I gotta tell ya,

829
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:37,225
I was absolutely, 100%...

830
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:40,053
correct!

831
00:56:41,315 --> 00:56:46,856
Have... Have you ever seen
anything more beautiful in your life?

832
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:51,652
- It's... Insect...
- Shh! Don't jinx it. Come on!

Mm.

00:59:01,705 --> 00:59:05,574
- This stuff tastes like crap.
- Really? Let me try some.

853
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:10,708
Hey, it is crap. Not bad.

854
00:59:12,007 --> 00:59:16,217
- Somebody needs to feed that fire.
- Dude, I did it last time.

855
00:59:16,303 --> 00:59:19,137
I'm not gonna get it. It's not my job.

856
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:21,381
Well, what about the new guy?

857
00:59:21,475 --> 00:59:23,387
He hasn't contributed yet.

858
00:59:24,144 --> 00:59:27,808
And... you know,
he just died in my arms like that.

859
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:34,270
I... You know, I don't think he ever once
in his life made his own choice.

860
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:37,605
I never knew it was like that.

861
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:40,525
I mean, up in the palace...

862
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:45,246
Well, I guess we just let the General
make all the decisions.

863
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:49,037
Let me ask you something.

864
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:51,998
What made you come to the bar that night?

865
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:55,668
I guess I was looking for
a little trouble.

866
00:59:55,759 --> 00:59:58,342
Well, trouble's my middle name.

867
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:01,587
Actually, my middle name is Marion, but...

868
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:05,345
- I don't want you to spread that around.
- You're pretty strange.

869
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:07,176
You do know that, don't you?

870
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:10,854
Well, "strange" is not exactly
the word I would use.

871
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:13,934
- You know, I...
- I like it. You're not like anyone else.

872
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:18,897
Actually, now that you mention it,
there is a certain strangeness to me.

873
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:21,903
I mean, it's a, you know,
kind of a bizarre quality.

874
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:23,985
Some have said "freak."

875
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:26,662
But it's, uh, you know, complimentary.

876
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:34,204
Hey, new guy! We need more wood!

877
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,838
I'll be right back.
Just hold that thought.

878
01:00:39,928 --> 01:00:41,885
Whatever it is you were thinking.

879
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:46,139
Hey, you ever wonder why
they call you guys "pests"?

880
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:50,978
What if, like,
we're just these tiny little things,

881
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:56,276
and we're just, like, part of this whole
other huge universe that's, like,

882
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:58,944
so big we don't even know it exists?

883
01:00:59,406 --> 01:01:02,774
Man, that is so deep.

884
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:04,032
Perfect!

885
01:01:04,119 --> 01:01:08,079
Nothing like a little manual labor
on the most romantic night of my life.

886
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:15,045
Hi.

887
01:01:15,297 --> 01:01:18,165
I was in the neighborhood,
and I thought I'd drop in.

888
01:01:19,593 --> 01:01:23,303
This is, uh... very bohemian.

889
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:27,257
Aloha, dude. Welcome to Insec...

890
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:28,350
...topia.

891
01:01:28,727 --> 01:01:30,844
Sorry for interrupting.

892
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:37,104
You see, our princess
has, uh, gone missing,

893
01:01:37,194 --> 01:01:39,356
and we're just sick about it.

894
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:44,866
She's about yea tall,
fairly easy on the eyes.

895
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:48,740
- Anybody seen her?
- There she is. That's her. Yeah.

896
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:53,704
Don't worry, Princess,
you'll be back home soon.

897
01:01:54,294 --> 01:01:57,162
Listen, Cutter, I'm... I'm not going back.

898
01:01:57,672 --> 01:02:00,836
The thing is,
Princess, I got orders.

899
01:02:01,218 --> 01:02:02,218
Orders?

900
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:05,128
Can't you just once think for yourself?

901
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:09,136
Well, that was very impressive.

902
01:02:09,601 --> 01:02:10,842
Where's Z?

903
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,894
- Z? He's, uh...
- Dead!

904
01:02:15,315 --> 01:02:16,476
Z's dead.

905
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:18,941
You don't need to worry about him.

906
01:02:19,027 --> 01:02:23,613
Z's dead. Well, he was an ant with ideas.

907
01:02:24,282 --> 01:02:25,489
Too bad for him.

908
01:02:26,368 --> 01:02:28,826
Princess, your colony needs you.

909
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:31,074
Cutter!

910
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:34,202
- Stop right now! Let go of me!
- Bala!

911
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:35,658
Stop, you... Hey!

912
01:02:36,795 --> 01:02:37,795
Oh, no.

913
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:40,291
What am I gonna do?

914
01:02:41,091 --> 01:02:44,129
All right, look, look.
Let's be rational about this.

915
01:02:44,552 --> 01:02:47,465
You know, Bala and I,
you know, she's a princess,

916
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:50,889
and I'm a soil-relocation engineer.

917
01:02:50,976 --> 01:02:52,592
So wha... You're no... Whew!

918
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:54,435
On the other hand, uh...

919
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:57,263
I've gotta go back for her.

920
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:59,857
I'll... I'll give you a lift!

921
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:03,686
S-S-S... Whoa! Oh!

922
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,942
It's the least I can do.

923
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:12,203
Besides,
it's what my waddly-kittles would want.

924
01:03:14,666 --> 01:03:17,955
Uh, look,
how about a cup of joe first?

925
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:21,333
- Well, old boy, saddle up.
- I saw a puddle of coffee over there.

926
01:03:21,423 --> 01:03:23,961
It... It... Whoa!

927
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:31,471
Look out!

928
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,142
Wait for my signal.

929
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:37,060
Ah, Princess!

930
01:03:37,147 --> 01:03:39,981
- You're just in time.
- Take your hands off me.

931
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:43,734
General, what exactly is going on here?

932
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:47,530
- I demand an explanation.
- I'll explain everything afterwards.

933
01:03:48,116 --> 01:03:49,956
- Is the southeast entrance secure?
- Yes, sir.

934
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:51,946
Not afterwards.

935
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:53,329
Now.

936
01:03:56,624 --> 01:03:58,206
I don't like the way you think,

937
01:03:58,293 --> 01:04:00,785
and I don't like the way
you run this colony.

938
01:04:01,046 --> 01:04:03,959
And I don't like you. The wedding is off.

939
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:06,499
Things are going to change around here.

940
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:08,334
You're right, Princess.

941
01:04:09,137 --> 01:04:10,548
Things are going to change.

942
01:04:10,972 --> 01:04:12,759
Why don't we make her more comfortable?

943
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:14,761
She'll be here for a while.

944
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:18,177
What do you think you're doing?

945
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:20,771
My mother will have your head!

946
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:22,849
I doubt that.

947
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:26,102
Ah, you've got a fighter's spirit, Bala.

948
01:04:26,196 --> 01:04:28,984
And that's just what we need
to start our new colony.

949
01:04:29,449 --> 01:04:32,192
We will rinse away all
the filth from our gutters.

950
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:35,869
We'll start anew,
with you by my side as my queen.

951
01:04:36,748 --> 01:04:38,034
You're crazy.

952
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:42,626
I believe history will see
things differently.

953
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:46,296
All right, gentlemen.
Time to take your positions.

954
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:50,043
Someday... Someday you'll thank me.

955
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:01,603
Pull up! Pull up! Ah!

956
01:05:02,482 --> 01:05:04,565
There it is!

957
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:11,443
Well, then, go get the woman you love, Z.

958
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:14,779
So long, Chip. And thanks.

959
01:05:20,375 --> 01:05:21,375
You there!

960
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:22,739
Where do you think you're goin'?

961
01:05:22,794 --> 01:05:25,707
Me? Oh, no, I was just... You know, I...

962
01:05:25,797 --> 01:05:27,413
You're not supposed to be out here.

963
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:31,000
All workers are to report
to the tunnel-opening ceremonies.

964
01:05:31,094 --> 01:05:34,303
Oh! Yes, yes, of course!
The-The tunnel-opening ceremonies.

965
01:05:34,389 --> 01:05:37,678
I... Well, I should get going, then.
I...

966
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:38,883
You know, the...

967
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:40,850
Hey!

968
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:44,101
I'm going to the...
the tunnel opening ceremonies.

969
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:46,182
- I'd better get goin'.
- Get moving.

970
01:05:46,693 --> 01:05:49,185
I'm going to the...
the tunnel-opening ceremonies.

971
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:54,197
Excuse me, please.
Tunnel-opening ceremonies.

972
01:05:54,284 --> 01:05:56,992
- Hey, worker!
- Opening the tunnel. They need me.

973
01:05:57,078 --> 01:05:59,320
- I'm the key man.
- Where do you think you're going?

974
01:05:59,414 --> 01:06:01,076
Tunnel-opening ceremonies.

975
01:06:05,295 --> 01:06:08,208
Hey, come on! Let me outta here!

976
01:06:08,298 --> 01:06:09,298
Hey!

977
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:19,723
Gosh, this day just keeps getting
better and better.

978
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:22,847
Big trouble!

979
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:27,894
Are you listening to me out there?
I'm a princess,

980
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:29,100
damn it!

981
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:35,739
Wow, your manners haven't improved much.

982
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:36,611
Z!

983
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:38,651
Whoa! Whoa!

984
01:06:38,745 --> 01:06:42,785
- Oh!
- It's you. You came back for me.

985
01:06:42,874 --> 01:06:47,665
Well, yeah, I came back for you.
You know, I have strong feelings for you.

986
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:51,122
Let's face it, you're... you're...
you're beautiful. I...

987
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:55,960
A little combative at times,
but I think we can work on that.

988
01:06:56,054 --> 01:06:57,511
You talk too much.

989
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:04,598
Gee, I think I'm about to become
the strong, silent type.

990
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:10,066
Come on. The city's deserted.
We'd better get outta here.

991
01:07:10,151 --> 01:07:13,360
Z... we can't go.

992
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:17,110
Mandible's insane.
He keeps talking about

993
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:21,194
washing away the filth
and changing history and...

994
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:23,746
and I think he's going to try
to kill my mother.

995
01:07:24,332 --> 01:07:27,245
Not just your mother, everyone.

996
01:07:27,585 --> 01:07:29,542
- What's going on?
- Look.

997
01:07:30,213 --> 01:07:31,670
Here we are, safe in the city.

998
01:07:32,423 --> 01:07:34,583
But they're gonna seal
everybody off in the MegaTunnel.

999
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:37,296
And... here's the lake.

1000
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,215
You're right.

1001
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:41,425
We can't leave now.

1002
01:07:42,809 --> 01:07:44,391
Come on. We gotta get down there.

1003
01:07:45,395 --> 01:07:48,513
Today is the realization of a dream.

1004
01:07:49,274 --> 01:07:50,981
A dream of a proud colony.

1005
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:55,774
A pure colony. A colony reborn.

1006
01:08:00,243 --> 01:08:03,361
Moments from now this tunnel will open.

1007
01:08:03,871 --> 01:08:08,332
The past will be washed away,
and a new day will dawn.

1008
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:12,415
A stirring speech, General.

1009
01:08:13,256 --> 01:08:15,589
I only wish my daughter
were here to appreciate it.

1010
01:08:15,675 --> 01:08:18,634
Your Majesty, I know how concerned
you are about Bala.

1011
01:08:19,137 --> 01:08:22,426
But my scouts are on her trail
and it's only a matter of time before...

1012
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:25,553
General, I don't want to discuss it.
Just find her.

1013
01:08:26,311 --> 01:08:27,427
I will, Your Highness.

1014
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:29,980
Goodbye.

1015
01:08:46,623 --> 01:08:47,989
Seal up the doors.

1016
01:08:49,042 --> 01:08:50,283
Cutter, did you hear me?

1017
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:52,910
Sir, I've been thinking.

1018
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:55,458
Do we need to go through with this?

1019
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:58,131
Look at what these workers have done.

1020
01:08:58,217 --> 01:09:02,131
They got the right stuff.
Isn't there any other way?

1021
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:03,883
Cutter, you're a fine officer.

1022
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:06,716
You have discipline, courage, ability.

1023
01:09:07,477 --> 01:09:11,096
But you seem to have a certain weakness
for the lower orders I find disturbing.

1024
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:15,895
- Now, are you with me?
- Sir, uh... I apologize.

1025
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:19,228
- All right, then. Seal it up.
- Yes, sir.

1026
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:34,626
As I look out
on this magnificent tunnel,

1027
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:37,246
I am filled with pride.

1028
01:09:38,132 --> 01:09:40,749
- Jump!
- In these difficult times,

1029
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:44,587
it is a great solace to know
that you, our workers...

1030
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:46,859
Mom! Wait!

1031
01:09:47,058 --> 01:09:48,845
Every worker in the colony is here.

1032
01:09:49,894 --> 01:09:51,574
Hey, wait a minute.
That guy owes me money.

1033
01:09:51,646 --> 01:09:54,229
This tremendous accomplishment
is a testimony to the strength...

1034
01:09:54,315 --> 01:09:57,103
- People! Put your backs into it!
- Go warn your mother.

1035
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:59,685
I gotta get to those diggers
before they break through!

1036
01:09:59,779 --> 01:10:00,986
There's not enough time!

1037
01:10:01,072 --> 01:10:03,815
Hey, leave the pessimism to me, okay?

1038
01:10:04,701 --> 01:10:08,365
Ow! Ooh! Yeeow!

1039
01:10:08,454 --> 01:10:11,037
Excuse me! Sorry about that. Excuse me.

1040
01:10:11,124 --> 01:10:14,367
In a few moments when our expert diggers
break through to the surface...

1041
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:16,998
- Mom! Mom, stop.
- ...the sun will pour into this...

1042
01:10:17,547 --> 01:10:19,960
Bala! Where've you been?
Are you all right?

1043
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:22,883
- I'm fine.
- What happened?

1044
01:10:23,261 --> 01:10:25,378
Mother, we're in terrible danger.

1045
01:10:36,983 --> 01:10:39,100
Put your backs into it, people.

1046
01:10:39,694 --> 01:10:42,437
Wait! Hold... Hey, stop digging!

1047
01:10:42,530 --> 01:10:45,273
- Z? Is that you?
- Weaver, stop!

1048
01:10:45,366 --> 01:10:47,653
Z! You're back!

1049
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:49,485
- Oh, Z! Oh.
- Weaver!

1050
01:10:49,579 --> 01:10:52,242
Z! What's the matter?

1051
01:10:53,124 --> 01:10:56,242
Ho-Hold up, everyone! Stop! Stop digging!

1052
01:10:56,335 --> 01:10:58,998
- On whose authority?
- On your own authority.

1053
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:01,296
If you break through that wall,
we're all gonna...

1054
01:11:01,382 --> 01:11:03,795
Drown! This tunnel is going to flood.

1055
01:11:03,885 --> 01:11:06,127
So we've got to get everyone out of here.

1056
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:11,974
Look, I got orders,
and those orders say "dig."

1057
01:11:12,059 --> 01:11:14,847
What if someone ordered you
to jump off a bridge? Ju-Ju-Ju...

1058
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:20,183
Brother, I'm asking the wrong guy here.
Look, think for yourselves!

1059
01:11:20,985 --> 01:11:23,147
Gimme that! I've had enough out of you.

1060
01:11:23,905 --> 01:11:24,905
Get back to work!

1061
01:11:25,823 --> 01:11:26,903
What's that noise?

1062
01:11:28,576 --> 01:11:29,576
Uh-oh.

1063
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,702
- Let's get outta here!
- Run!

1064
01:11:34,874 --> 01:11:37,287
Run! Run! Keep going!

1065
01:11:37,919 --> 01:11:41,754
Everyone, listen to me.
We've all been deceived.

1066
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:45,875
We need to calmly head toward the exits.

1067
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:49,507
- Run for your lives! It's gonna flood!
- No. Don't panic.

1068
01:11:49,597 --> 01:11:52,886
- Don't panic!
- Every ant for himself!

1069
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:04,480
- All the exits are blocked!
- We're trapped!

1070
01:12:29,303 --> 01:12:31,670
- What are we going to do?
- There's nothing we can do!

1071
01:12:38,688 --> 01:12:41,351
Yes, there is. Weaver, give me a leg up!

1072
01:12:42,441 --> 01:12:44,728
Everyone, listen to me!

1073
01:12:44,819 --> 01:12:47,402
- Who the heck are you?
- He's Z!

1074
01:12:50,992 --> 01:12:55,111
Listen, we gotta help each other
get outta here before we all drown!

1075
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:56,035
How?

1076
01:12:56,122 --> 01:12:58,409
- By making a ladder.
- A ladder!

1077
01:12:58,499 --> 01:13:01,492
Hey, if we built this, we can do anything.

1078
01:13:01,836 --> 01:13:05,500
- Okay, let's move it!
- I'm on it. All of you, gather round.

1079
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:06,876
You, start climbing.

1080
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:11,464
- Grab my arm.
- All right. Here I go.

1081
01:13:11,554 --> 01:13:13,295
- Go, go, go!
- All right!

1082
01:13:15,683 --> 01:13:17,390
Excuse me, Your Majesty.

1083
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:22,187
Z, I've gotta help my mom.

1084
01:13:22,815 --> 01:13:23,646
Don't worry.

1085
01:13:23,733 --> 01:13:25,895
I know almost exactly what I'm doing.

1086
01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:29,945
I'll see you at the top.

1087
01:13:34,368 --> 01:13:39,955
Gentlemen, there comes a time
in the evolution of a perfect colony

1088
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:43,538
when the strong are meant
to rise above the weak.

1089
01:13:44,921 --> 01:13:47,163
Now is that time.

1090
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:52,585
<i>Below us right now,
the weak elements of the colony</i>

1091
01:13:52,678 --> 01:13:54,044
<i>are being washed away.</i>

1092
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:59,675
Oh, my God, we're not gonna make it!

1093
01:13:59,769 --> 01:14:02,682
- We need more ants.
- You two better get up there.

1094
01:14:02,772 --> 01:14:05,105
Weaver, you can't hold it alone.

1095
01:14:05,191 --> 01:14:06,807
Get going!

1096
01:14:07,818 --> 01:14:08,934
Hang in there, buddy.

1097
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:26,543
- Got it!
- Hurry up! Go, go, go, go!

1098
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:34,384
Our princess is secured,
and our glorious future is at hand.

1099
01:14:35,012 --> 01:14:36,628
We can all stand proud.

1100
01:14:37,098 --> 01:14:39,715
It is time for a new beginning.

1101
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:53,483
What the hell is that?

1102
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:55,982
I think that's the weak elements, sir.

1103
01:14:56,075 --> 01:14:59,614
- Gimme a hand!
- Z! You?

1104
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:04,824
Let go! Don't you understand?
It's for the good of the colony.

1105
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:08,126
What are you saying? We are the colony!

1106
01:15:12,258 --> 01:15:13,258
Cutter!

1107
01:15:13,968 --> 01:15:14,754
What are you doing?

1108
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:17,928
Something I should've done
a long time ago.

1109
01:15:18,389 --> 01:15:21,427
This is for the good of the colony, sir.

1110
01:15:23,436 --> 01:15:25,598
You useless, ungrateful maggot!

1111
01:15:25,688 --> 01:15:28,556
- I am the colony!
- Look out!

1112
01:15:28,649 --> 01:15:32,518
Oof! Ah!

1113
01:15:39,827 --> 01:15:40,827
Z!

1114
01:15:42,288 --> 01:15:45,622
Men, let's move it!
Get these ants up here.

1115
01:15:49,628 --> 01:15:52,086
- Keep it moving.
- Thank goodness we made it.

1116
01:15:57,970 --> 01:15:58,970
Wait here.

1117
01:16:08,355 --> 01:16:10,438
- Uh! Okay.
- Thank you. Ooh!

1118
01:16:10,733 --> 01:16:11,733
Weaver!

1119
01:16:13,277 --> 01:16:14,393
Where's Z?

1120
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,120
Oh, no.

1121
01:16:25,081 --> 01:16:27,073
Back up, everybody, back up!

1122
01:16:27,166 --> 01:16:30,910
- Give him some air. Back up!
- Z, oh, Z.

1123
01:16:35,549 --> 01:16:36,915
Please wake up.

1124
01:16:39,386 --> 01:16:40,547
Oh, no!

1125
01:16:45,893 --> 01:16:48,761
Huh!

1126
01:16:56,028 --> 01:16:57,109
Yowch!

1127
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:02,028
You know, Weaver,
you still owe me that dinner.

1128
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:04,452
Baby love.

1129
01:17:05,788 --> 01:17:08,781
- We made it, Z!
- You da ant!

1130
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:11,620
- Eh!
- You did it.

1131
01:17:12,086 --> 01:17:13,086
We did it.

1132
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:16,754
- Fellas, fellas, please.
- Oh! Oh!

1133
01:17:16,841 --> 01:17:19,254
This is very embarrassing for me, I...

1134
01:17:19,343 --> 01:17:23,132
On the other hand,
I probably could get used to this.

1135
01:17:26,392 --> 01:17:28,884
<i>There you have it.
Your average "boy meets girl,</i>

1136
01:17:28,978 --> 01:17:33,063
<i>boy likes girl, boy changes
underlying social order" story.</i>

1137
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:35,561
<i>So, what else can I tell you?</i>

1138
01:17:36,068 --> 01:17:38,776
<i>We rebuilt the colony.
It's even better than before,</i>

1139
01:17:38,863 --> 01:17:42,322
<i>you know, 'cause now it has
a very large indoor swimming pool.</i>

1140
01:17:42,825 --> 01:17:45,989
<i>Bala and I, incidentally,
are thinking of starting a family,</i>

1141
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:50,618
<i>you know, just a few kids,
maybe a million or two to begin with.</i>

1142
01:17:50,958 --> 01:17:55,248
<i>And I'm workin' with a new therapist,
you know, terrific, absolutely terrific.</i>

1143
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:58,546
<i>He's been putting me in touch
with my inner maggot,</i>

1144
01:17:58,632 --> 01:18:00,089
<i>which is helping me a great deal.</i>

1145
01:18:00,176 --> 01:18:03,590
<i>And, you know, I finally feel like
I've found my place.</i>

1146
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:06,012
<i>And you know what?
It's right back where I started.</i>

1147
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:09,929
