1
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,176
Hello?

2
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:16,720
Is someone there?

3
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,493
Who's there?

4
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:47,662
<i>You've reached David and Laura.</i>

5
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:50,373
Hello.
It's Laura.

6
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:52,750
You didn't change the message.

7
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,502
It's been over a month.

8
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:56,629
I know, I know. I just
haven't had the time.

9
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,840
I can't even find
the instructions.

10
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:00,591
<i>Keeping busy over there?</i>

11
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:01,884
Yes.

12
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:04,303
Just gardening, painting,

13
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,306
trying to get all the pieces
done for the show, you know?

14
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,725
Good. Good, good.
Maybe you should,

15
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,769
I don't know, hit up
eharmony while you're at it.

16
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,855
Vicki, come on.

17
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:15,940
It's either that or you
move back to the city.

18
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:18,401
I can't be the only one
getting action around here.

19
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:20,069
No, what I need is a big sale.

20
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,071
<i>Yes.
That, my dear,</i>

21
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:24,407
<i>is what alimony is for.</i>

22
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:32,915
Oscar,

23
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,459
do you have the remote?

24
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,753
<i>Male reporter: The San
Francisco police department</i>

25
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,423
<i>has not confirmed
that palardis's death</i>

26
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:44,093
<i>was in fact a suicide.
The police are puzzled</i>

27
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,804
<i>- regarding the circumstances surrounding this case.
- Vicki: Hello?</i>

28
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:48,931
<i>- I'm gonna have to call you back.
- Palardis was perhaps</i>

29
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:50,892
<i>best known
as foreman of the jury</i>

30
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:53,728
<i>on the infamous
midnight murderer case.</i>

31
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:57,440
<i>Six months ago, he self-published
a book about the trial</i>

32
00:05:57,441 --> 00:06:00,110
<i>and was reportedly working
on a follow-up.</i>

33
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:35,853
<i>Man: Do you want to
tell me what the hell</i>

34
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,438
<i>we're doing up here, Mike?</i>

35
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,940
I'm investigating.

36
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:40,984
And you're in my light.

37
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:44,111
Now I know that must have hurt.

38
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,948
Don't you have some pressing business
to take care of back at the station?

39
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:48,824
Well, actually, Mike,
we both have

40
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,536
a lot of pressing business to
take care of back at the station,

41
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:54,497
which is why I'm wondering why you're
wasting your time on a suicide.

42
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:57,542
People don't just throw themselves
off buildings without a reason.

43
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:59,794
Well, I hate
to tell you this, Mike,

44
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:02,004
but sometimes bad stuff
just happens.

45
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:04,465
Shall I have the m.E. Put that
on the death certificate?

46
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:06,509
He can quote me on it.

47
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,971
Why don't you go grab a latte or something?
I'll be down in a few.

48
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:12,723
Who are you kidding with that?
You know you want a cigarette.

49
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:14,559
I haven't had a cigarette
in over a month.

50
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,602
Congratulations.

51
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,521
Listen, Mike, I know
you knew the guy,

52
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:20,607
but please don't be too long.

53
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:18,748
There's no note.

54
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:20,750
I thought you'd like to know.

55
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:22,794
Thanks.

56
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:49,070
- All right, Frank.
- Huh?

57
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:51,656
I brought you some magazines.

58
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:55,159
You expect me to be entertained

59
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,703
with these
two-year-old magazines

60
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,123
and "the people's court"?

61
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:06,170
Oh, hi.

62
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:08,631
Thank goodness you came.

63
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:10,633
Hi, Frank.
I brought you a muffin.

64
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:14,846
Oh, by the way, I got your
invite about the opening.

65
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:16,848
Yeah, yeah.
I was gonna tell you

66
00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:18,975
it's okay if you
don't want to go.

67
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:21,978
It's just a small, little gallery.
It's nothing, really.

68
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:24,314
I'll bet you
David is very proud.

69
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:27,567
Oh, I--
I forgot.

70
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:28,985
It's okay.

71
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:31,779
Hey, you didn't bring
the checkers.

72
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,823
No, I didn't today.

73
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:37,618
Um, I did bring you
this, though.

74
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:39,579
I thought you might
want to know.

75
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,040
What's this?

76
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:47,920
I-- I can't believe it.

77
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,922
The poor bastard.

78
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,217
Suicide?

79
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:58,848
<i>Have you talked to him lately?</i>

80
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:02,226
Well, he did call me
about a year ago

81
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:04,270
to ask how I was

82
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:07,106
and sent me the book.
Did he call you?

83
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,651
No, not since the trial.

84
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:15,823
And, the funeral
is tomorrow, so...

85
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,366
Are you going?

86
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:20,787
Come on, it's been five years.

87
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:27,084
Do you think the others
will be there?

88
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:29,670
I don't know.
Maybe.

89
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:33,299
Seems like
only yesterday--

90
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,842
our brush with history.

91
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:37,637
You know, some things
history should forget.

92
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:39,847
You should try reading that.

93
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:42,726
I prefer to keep
the past where it is.

94
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:47,271
Listen, when you get to be
as old as I am,

95
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:50,900
the past is all you've got.

96
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:53,653
I've got to get going.

97
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:56,323
So soon?
You just came.

98
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:00,409
I have a lot of painting
to catch up on.

99
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,119
Do you have to go?

100
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,830
I do, but I promise you

101
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:06,332
I will bring checkers
next time.

102
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:09,002
Listen, you take care, huh?

103
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:12,088
Well, you too.

104
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:14,298
And you be nice to her.

105
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:17,052
Hey, bill.

106
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:33,109
No, it won't take very much time.

107
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,111
I just need someone to
take a look at the door.

108
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:37,738
Maybe it needs a new doorknob.

109
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:39,907
Um, yeah.

110
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:43,077
And then can somebody also check
the wiring in the kitchen?

111
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:45,079
The TV literally
turned itself on today.

112
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,081
Thanks.

113
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:49,126
Oscar?

114
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:52,421
Okay, thanks.
Bye.

115
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:05,058
Oscar!

116
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:12,733
Oscar.

117
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:16,820
Oscar.

118
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:22,868
<i>Oscar.</i>

119
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:33,378
Oscar.

120
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,009
Come here, boy.

121
00:12:43,347 --> 00:12:47,808
Oscar, what are you doing?

122
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:54,148
Do that again,
and it's dry dog food.

123
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:56,234
Aww.

124
00:12:56,235 --> 00:12:58,320
Why did you scare me like that?

125
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,168
<i>Man:
They are not dead</i>

126
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:17,088
<i>who leave us
this great inheritance</i>

127
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:19,465
for remembering joy.

128
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:22,426
They still live in our hearts,

129
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:25,054
<i>in the happiness we knew</i>

130
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:27,182
<i>and the dreams we shared.</i>

131
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:31,352
They still breathe

132
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:33,312
<i>in the lingering fragrance</i>

133
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:36,190
<i>windblown from their
favorite flower.</i>

134
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:38,526
<i>They still smile</i>

135
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:40,528
in the moonlight's silver.

136
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:43,865
And they laugh.
They still speak

137
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:47,326
in the echoes of the words
we've heard them say

138
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:50,204
<i>again and again.</i>

139
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:52,582
<i>They still move</i>

140
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:55,960
<i>in the rhythm of waving grasses</i>

141
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:58,171
<i>and the dance</i>

142
00:13:58,172 --> 00:14:01,382
<i>of billowing branches.</i>

143
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:05,428
They are not apart from us.

144
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:08,055
<i>They are a part of us,</i>

145
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:11,226
<i>for love is eternal.</i>

146
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:24,906
Miss price.

147
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:27,200
Detective Michael lyons,
homicide.

148
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:29,202
Got a second to talk
about Nathan?

149
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:32,955
Homicide? I thought the papers
said that he killed himself.

150
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:34,957
Papers say a lot of things.

151
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,126
He had a chart on the wall
of his apartment--

152
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:39,128
all the jurors
from the midnight trial.

153
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:41,130
He did write a book.

154
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:43,633
So you're saying you hadn't had
any communication with him?

155
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:45,635
Not in five years.

156
00:14:45,636 --> 00:14:47,470
Why did you come
to his funeral?

157
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:49,472
Detective, what are you
trying to ask me?

158
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:52,391
I was just wondering--
of the 12 names,

159
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:55,645
why yours was
the only one circled.

160
00:14:55,646 --> 00:14:58,148
I just want to go home.

161
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:02,611
When you feel up to it...

162
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:05,400
Good morning, Frank.

163
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:09,071
Time to rise and shine.

164
00:17:20,332 --> 00:17:23,251
Oh, Frank, how many
times have I told you?

165
00:17:23,252 --> 00:17:26,588
Close this window. You're
gonna catch a cold.

166
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:29,633
Frank.

167
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:38,432
We were on a jury together
five years ago.

168
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:41,310
Frank and I stayed
in touch on and off.

169
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:45,106
When he had a stroke, I--

170
00:17:45,107 --> 00:17:47,149
I really-- you know,
I tried to visit him

171
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,485
as often as I could.

172
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:52,197
I have his things here.

173
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:58,495
He had no next of kin.

174
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:10,548
Would you like
to feed my birds?

175
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:12,550
No, thank you.

176
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:14,552
He's dead.

177
00:18:14,553 --> 00:18:17,138
They were late with the
medicines this morning.

178
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:19,516
They're never late
with the medicines.

179
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:25,646
His visitor will not be happy.

180
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:28,149
I asked them to keep
their voices down.

181
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,484
I was trying to sleep.

182
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:32,528
It was so late.

183
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:34,238
What visitor?

184
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:36,240
It's a big one.

185
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:39,369
Aww, he's very hungry.
Aren't you, fella?

186
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,248
So many evils.

187
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:47,293
What was that?

188
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:50,171
I asked them to keep
their voices down.

189
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:52,841
I was trying to sleep.

190
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:57,471
Would you like
to feed my birds?

191
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:04,560
Just as I thought--

192
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:07,271
you're the only visitor listed.

193
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:10,650
So it isn't possible for
anyone else to have gotten in,

194
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:13,236
not after hours?

195
00:19:13,237 --> 00:19:15,530
We lock the doors
at 9:00 sharp

196
00:19:15,531 --> 00:19:17,698
for the safety of our
residents, of course.

197
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:20,285
Anyone who doesn't have
a key card...

198
00:19:25,374 --> 00:19:28,417
Woman:
Let me go.

199
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:30,879
Man: Cool it, would you?
Knock it off.

200
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:50,940
Bam! I had Parker
slip me the results

201
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:53,276
of your friend's
autopsy--

202
00:19:53,277 --> 00:19:55,444
blunt force trauma,

203
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:57,947
sustained on impact.

204
00:19:57,948 --> 00:20:00,783
No contusions or
defensive wounds found.

205
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:02,910
Yeah, what about the computer?

206
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:05,329
The hard drive was ionized.

207
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,331
Heads crashed.

208
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:09,542
What could have caused that?

209
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:12,336
Judging from the burn marks
on the internal suppressor,

210
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:16,257
I'd say a power surge.

211
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:17,758
A power surge?

212
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:20,303
Look, Mike, I know
he was your buddy,

213
00:20:20,304 --> 00:20:22,763
but you've seen the kid's file.

214
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:24,765
I searched that place
from top to bottom.

215
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:26,976
Parole violations, duis...

216
00:20:26,977 --> 00:20:29,937
And I couldn't even find a
goddamn bottle of cough syrup.

217
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:32,481
...court-ordered rehab.

218
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:35,818
It was just a matter of time.

219
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:38,654
You need to take
a step back, bro.

220
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:40,781
You're getting a little
too close to this thing.

221
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:42,700
A phone call for you,
Mike, on three.

222
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:44,577
Take a message.

223
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:46,913
It's Laura price.

224
00:20:46,914 --> 00:20:48,999
Thanks.

225
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:53,378
This is detective lyons.

226
00:20:54,463 --> 00:20:56,964
No, I hadn't heard.

227
00:20:56,965 --> 00:21:00,384
Okay, I'm on my way.

228
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:01,969
What's up?

229
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,971
That was the woman
from the midnight jury,

230
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:06,725
- the one I spoke to after the funeral.
- And?

231
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:11,021
Another juror was found dead.

232
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,531
I told miss price

233
00:21:21,532 --> 00:21:23,366
<i>we lock the doors
at 9:00 sharp.</i>

234
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:26,370
After that, no one
comes in or out.

235
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:30,289
<i>Laura: That's Frank's
room in the back.</i>

236
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,751
Would you mind
fast-forwarding?

237
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:46,806
What was that?

238
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:50,560
It's an old system.
That happens all the time.

239
00:21:50,561 --> 00:21:52,728
Can I get a copy of this?

240
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:55,607
Yeah, sure.

241
00:22:19,923 --> 00:22:22,008
<i>Man: O lord, we commit
the body of this child</i>

242
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:24,970
<i>to your safekeeping
in eternal flame.</i>

243
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:20,566
Hey.

244
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:23,027
Are you hungry?

245
00:23:23,028 --> 00:23:25,697
I'm hungry too.
Come on, let's go.

246
00:23:39,545 --> 00:23:41,546
Oscar?

247
00:25:09,176 --> 00:25:11,762
Hold on.

248
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:19,018
Sorry, there's no vacancies.

249
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:21,771
No, I'm not here
to rent an apartment.

250
00:25:21,772 --> 00:25:24,899
I'm here to see
a friend's place.

251
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,944
Okay, well, the call box is...

252
00:25:27,945 --> 00:25:30,697
Right over there.

253
00:25:32,032 --> 00:25:34,659
I'm here to see
the palardis apartment.

254
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,869
Okay, I'm gonna tell you
the same thing

255
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,871
that I told everyone else:

256
00:25:38,872 --> 00:25:41,791
<i>I'm not letting anyone
into his apartment, okay?</i>

257
00:25:41,792 --> 00:25:45,586
Look, I'm not a reporter, okay?

258
00:25:45,587 --> 00:25:48,215
Uh, hold on.

259
00:25:56,765 --> 00:25:59,977
Please, just five minutes.

260
00:28:06,854 --> 00:28:09,272
<i>Palardis: The execution
of Evan Lucas</i>

261
00:28:09,273 --> 00:28:12,066
<i>took place at 12:01 A.M.,
December 30th.</i>

262
00:28:14,903 --> 00:28:16,904
<i>...and begin
my second book</i>

263
00:28:16,905 --> 00:28:18,948
<i>covering the investigation

264
00:28:22,411 --> 00:28:25,037
<i>I saw it
again this afternoon.</i>

265
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:28,250
<i>I-it seems to be stalking
me wherever I go.</i>

266
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:18,174
I want to know what you
heard in Frank's room.

267
00:29:18,175 --> 00:29:21,010
Well, have you brought
any bread for my birds?

268
00:29:21,011 --> 00:29:23,346
No, this isn't about the birds.
We need to talk about Frank.

269
00:29:23,347 --> 00:29:25,973
I-- I don't know
any Frank.

270
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:28,100
Yes, Frank-- he lived
next door to you.

271
00:29:28,101 --> 00:29:30,436
- He passed away two nights ago.
- Please, I don't--

272
00:29:30,437 --> 00:29:33,356
no, please.
You said you heard talking.

273
00:29:33,357 --> 00:29:35,775
My birds would never
hurt anyone.

274
00:29:35,776 --> 00:29:38,277
"So many evils" -- what does it mean?
I need to know.

275
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:41,949
Oh, I-- I d--
evils.

276
00:29:43,534 --> 00:29:46,202
Excuse me.
A word, please.

277
00:29:46,203 --> 00:29:49,288
A word.

278
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:52,917
Our residents are nearing
the end of their lives.

279
00:29:52,918 --> 00:29:55,086
They are tired
and they are confused.

280
00:29:55,087 --> 00:29:57,255
She was not confused.

281
00:29:57,256 --> 00:29:59,340
I am sure that miss McCarthy

282
00:29:59,341 --> 00:30:01,342
thought that she
heard something.

283
00:30:01,343 --> 00:30:03,427
- She did hear something.
- However,

284
00:30:03,428 --> 00:30:07,223
I will not allow you to continue
to upset the residents.

285
00:30:07,224 --> 00:30:09,058
Fine.

286
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:11,060
Just let me talk to her
one more time.

287
00:30:11,061 --> 00:30:14,146
I am sorry, miss price, that
is not going to happen.

288
00:30:14,147 --> 00:30:17,316
<i>I need you to go.</i>

289
00:30:17,317 --> 00:30:19,111
Now.

290
00:30:20,571 --> 00:30:22,823
I'm sorry.

291
00:31:01,904 --> 00:31:05,239
Sonia Martinez? Hi.
It's Laura price.

292
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,326
We were on the jury together.

293
00:31:08,327 --> 00:31:11,871
Yeah, I saw you at the
funeral the other day.

294
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:14,290
I was hoping maybe
we could get together.

295
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:16,627
I want to talk to you
about a few things.

296
00:31:20,088 --> 00:31:22,089
Yeah.

297
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,091
Absolutely.

298
00:31:24,092 --> 00:31:26,136
Yeah, I can drive down too.

299
00:31:27,387 --> 00:31:29,973
Okay, thanks.
Bye.

300
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:11,931
<i>Sonia: Laura.</i>

301
00:32:11,932 --> 00:32:14,517
- Hi, Sonia.
- This is Eli.

302
00:32:14,518 --> 00:32:16,936
Hi, Eli.
My name is Laura.

303
00:32:16,937 --> 00:32:18,980
- Hi.
- Hi.

304
00:32:18,981 --> 00:32:20,982
Nice to meet you.

305
00:32:20,983 --> 00:32:23,609
- How have you been?
- Good. Good.

306
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:26,195
- Can I get my face painted?
- Eli.

307
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:28,614
- Please.
- Okay.

308
00:32:28,615 --> 00:32:31,201
But mommy's gonna stay here and
talk with her friend, okay?

309
00:32:35,247 --> 00:32:37,332
Sonia...

310
00:32:40,252 --> 00:32:42,545
Frank's dead too.

311
00:32:42,546 --> 00:32:44,505
What? When?

312
00:32:44,506 --> 00:32:46,132
Two days ago.

313
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:48,634
Mommy, I want to be a zombie.

314
00:32:48,635 --> 00:32:51,721
No, honey, nothing scary.

315
00:32:51,722 --> 00:32:54,015
<i>Fine.</i>

316
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:58,019
They're saying that
it's natural causes.

317
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,397
But you don't believe them.

318
00:33:02,191 --> 00:33:04,567
I spoke to the woman that lived
in the room next to Frank's

319
00:33:04,568 --> 00:33:06,736
and she said
that she heard voices

320
00:33:06,737 --> 00:33:09,238
coming from his room
the night he died.

321
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:12,116
But I checked, and there was
no one on the visitor log

322
00:33:12,117 --> 00:33:14,577
and there was nothing
on the security cameras.

323
00:33:14,578 --> 00:33:17,206
Did she say what she heard?

324
00:33:18,749 --> 00:33:20,750
Yeah.

325
00:33:20,751 --> 00:33:22,752
The bizarre thing is

326
00:33:22,753 --> 00:33:26,422
that I got these texts
the night that he died.

327
00:33:26,423 --> 00:33:28,090
"So many evils."

328
00:33:28,091 --> 00:33:29,759
Yes. Did you
get them too?

329
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,428
What could they mean?
Who--?

330
00:33:32,429 --> 00:33:35,431
Do you think it's possible that
a spirit could contact you

331
00:33:35,432 --> 00:33:37,433
from beyond the grave?

332
00:33:37,434 --> 00:33:39,435
Oh.

333
00:33:39,436 --> 00:33:42,772
I don't know.
Maybe. Why?

334
00:33:42,773 --> 00:33:44,774
Well, a couple of weeks ago,

335
00:33:44,775 --> 00:33:48,069
I started to get this
sensation when I was alone,

336
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:50,321
like someone was watching me.

337
00:33:50,322 --> 00:33:53,241
And my parish priest said
that there's no such thing

338
00:33:53,242 --> 00:33:55,243
and I was just making
it up in my head.

339
00:33:55,244 --> 00:33:57,245
But the strangest part is,

340
00:33:57,246 --> 00:34:00,122
"so many evils"
is the last thing

341
00:34:00,123 --> 00:34:02,291
that Evan Lucas said
before he died.

342
00:34:02,292 --> 00:34:04,669
What if he's come back?

343
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:08,089
What if he wants revenge
for what we did?

344
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:09,757
<i>He could come back
for any one of us next.</i>

345
00:34:09,758 --> 00:34:12,718
He--
what is it?

346
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,263
You see something, don't you?

347
00:34:15,264 --> 00:34:18,224
Eli!
Eli, come here.

348
00:34:18,225 --> 00:34:21,144
- I'm not done.
- Now.

349
00:34:24,314 --> 00:34:28,401
- Be careful.
- Just go.

350
00:34:28,402 --> 00:34:31,655
Sweetie, we have to go. We
can't do any face-painting.

351
00:34:57,514 --> 00:34:59,141
What?

352
00:35:02,644 --> 00:35:04,396
Dunbar?

353
00:35:16,492 --> 00:35:18,868
<i>Directory assistance.

00:35:18,869 --> 00:35:21,496

00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:27,627
<i>I'm sorry, but that number
has been disconnected.</i>

357
00:35:27,628 --> 00:35:30,338
Is there a forwarding
number or address?

358
00:35:30,339 --> 00:35:32,840
<i>No, ma'am, I'm sorry.</i>

359
00:35:32,841 --> 00:35:35,385
Okay, thank you.

360
00:36:53,463 --> 00:36:55,798
<i>Hi. You've reached Sonia.
Please leave a message.</i>

361
00:36:57,634 --> 00:36:59,635
Sonia, it's Laura. Do me
a favor, call me back

362
00:36:59,636 --> 00:37:01,971
as soon as you can, okay?
It's really important.

363
00:37:01,972 --> 00:37:03,973
I'm gonna try
your other number.

364
00:37:08,562 --> 00:37:11,772
<i>- Man: Hello.
- Hi. Is Sonia there?</i>

365
00:37:11,773 --> 00:37:15,776
<i>- Who is this?
- This is Laura price. It's really important.</i>

366
00:37:15,777 --> 00:37:18,529
<i>Oh, Laura, I'm sorry.</i>

367
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:20,531
<i>Sonia passed away last night.</i>

368
00:37:20,532 --> 00:37:22,533
What?

369
00:37:22,534 --> 00:37:24,535
<i>We're having some people
over to the house</i>

370
00:37:24,536 --> 00:37:26,914
<i>if you'd like
to pay your respects.</i>

371
00:37:29,249 --> 00:37:31,667
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, okay.

372
00:37:31,668 --> 00:37:34,630
Um, what's the address?

373
00:38:03,951 --> 00:38:06,537
Hi. Welcome.
Thanks for coming.

374
00:38:08,539 --> 00:38:10,832
<i>Woman: I can't believe
she killed herself</i>

375
00:38:10,833 --> 00:38:12,875
<i>in her own house.</i>

376
00:38:12,876 --> 00:38:15,294
<i>Man: What's going to happen to her son?
The family...</i>

377
00:38:15,295 --> 00:38:18,048
<i>Man #2: This is gonna
be an interesting...</i>

378
00:39:56,647 --> 00:39:58,732
She's with them now.

379
00:40:02,986 --> 00:40:04,738
You're next.

380
00:41:19,062 --> 00:41:21,063
Laura: Look.

381
00:41:21,064 --> 00:41:24,066
Two, three, four--
they're dying in order,

382
00:41:24,067 --> 00:41:26,736
every three days.

383
00:41:26,737 --> 00:41:29,155
This is 3,000 Miles away.

384
00:41:29,156 --> 00:41:31,157
I know, but I'm
juror number five,

385
00:41:31,158 --> 00:41:33,868
so let's just pretend it
might not be a coincidence.

386
00:41:33,869 --> 00:41:37,080
What do you mean, it might
not be a coincidence?

387
00:41:38,832 --> 00:41:41,834
'Cause Sonia said that she felt
like she was being watched.

388
00:41:41,835 --> 00:41:44,170
And the woman from
the nursing home said

389
00:41:44,171 --> 00:41:46,756
that she heard somebody talking
to Frank the night he died.

390
00:41:46,757 --> 00:41:49,717
We watched the security
tape together.

391
00:41:49,718 --> 00:41:52,595
- Yeah, I know.
- And we didn't see anything.

392
00:41:52,596 --> 00:41:55,598
Well, nothing physical.

393
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:58,976
Look, what if--

394
00:41:58,977 --> 00:42:00,937
what if he's back?

395
00:42:00,938 --> 00:42:02,980
Who?

396
00:42:02,981 --> 00:42:05,984
The midnight murderer--
what if he's back?

397
00:42:08,028 --> 00:42:10,029
Laura,

398
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:12,281
Evan Lucas is dead.

399
00:42:12,282 --> 00:42:14,283
<i>20 people saw him executed.</i>

400
00:42:14,284 --> 00:42:16,829
I know.
Trust me, I know.

401
00:42:18,872 --> 00:42:22,124
What if--
what if somehow--

402
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:25,294
somehow his spirit is
trying to kill the people

403
00:42:25,295 --> 00:42:27,589
that are responsible
for his execution?

404
00:42:29,883 --> 00:42:32,301
I promise you,
I'm on top of this.

405
00:42:32,302 --> 00:42:34,804
Nothing's gonna
happen to you, okay?

406
00:42:34,805 --> 00:42:38,767
I'll have marin pd put somebody
in front of your house 24/7.

407
00:42:40,185 --> 00:42:41,978
Right.

408
00:42:41,979 --> 00:42:43,814
Can I get you an escort home?

409
00:42:45,816 --> 00:42:47,817
Um, no.

410
00:42:47,818 --> 00:42:50,319
Thank you.

411
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,865
Um, I'll just wait
for your call.

412
00:42:55,117 --> 00:42:57,161
Thanks.

413
00:43:07,588 --> 00:43:09,589
We're closing in 15 minutes.

414
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:11,591
Do you have any books
on the supernatural--

415
00:43:11,592 --> 00:43:13,593
spirits, entities,
anything like that?

416
00:43:13,594 --> 00:43:15,637
Downstairs, a-14.

417
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:17,346
Thanks.

418
00:43:17,347 --> 00:43:19,600
15 minutes.

419
00:43:44,166 --> 00:43:48,837
Professor mylene wolfe,
San Francisco college.

420
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,070
I think they're closing.

421
00:44:38,262 --> 00:44:41,848
A car accident, heart attack,
two confirmed suicides,

422
00:44:41,849 --> 00:44:45,226
and you think someone
actually killed these people?

423
00:44:45,227 --> 00:44:47,186
You were the detective
in the midnight case.

424
00:44:47,187 --> 00:44:51,274
If you're asking me if I believe
in ghosts, the answer is no.

425
00:44:51,275 --> 00:44:53,442
What about copycats? It's
a five-year anniversary.

426
00:44:53,443 --> 00:44:55,862
What if someone's trying to
make a name for themselves?

427
00:44:55,863 --> 00:44:57,321
Mike.

428
00:44:57,322 --> 00:44:59,365
Four jurors, John.

429
00:44:59,366 --> 00:45:01,743
Maybe we should take
a closer look.

430
00:45:08,375 --> 00:45:11,836
Our subject--
a 45-year-old woman

431
00:45:11,837 --> 00:45:13,838
from lake Charles,
Louisiana--

432
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:16,758
had noticed a strange
glare in photographs

433
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,927
<i>that she had taken inside the
home, as you can see here.</i>

434
00:45:19,928 --> 00:45:23,347
<i>That strange shape
kept appearing in photo</i>

435
00:45:23,348 --> 00:45:28,019
after photo after photo,

436
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:30,313
but only in photographs
that she had taken

437
00:45:30,314 --> 00:45:32,398
inside of her home.

438
00:45:32,399 --> 00:45:34,901
After she
e-mailed me these,

439
00:45:34,902 --> 00:45:38,279
I decided to apply levels
of spectral imaging

440
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:41,991
to see if I could discern
anything from the images.

441
00:45:41,992 --> 00:45:44,076
<i>In each photo, the phenomenon</i>

442
00:45:44,077 --> 00:45:46,829
<i>was indicating a particular
point in the house.</i>

443
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:49,040
<i>Turns out that
the subject's husband</i>

444
00:45:49,041 --> 00:45:51,167
<i>had died two months prior.</i>

445
00:45:51,168 --> 00:45:55,296
And when she took a closer
look, she found this.

446
00:45:55,297 --> 00:45:59,968
Unable to properly communicate
his farewell to her in person,

447
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:03,513
<i>he'd written her a message and
left it here for her to find.</i>

448
00:46:03,514 --> 00:46:06,975
<i>- Lights, please.</i>

449
00:46:07,017 --> 00:46:08,977
I want all of you

450
00:46:09,019 --> 00:46:11,479
to think of ghosts as remnants,

451
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:14,983
shadows left behind
by the recently departed.

452
00:46:15,025 --> 00:46:17,986
<i>And if you open your mind
just a little,</i>

453
00:46:18,028 --> 00:46:21,156
you'll find that they
have something to say.

454
00:46:22,533 --> 00:46:24,951
Oh, and don't forget
to read chapter six

455
00:46:24,952 --> 00:46:27,412
<i>for next time, please.
Thank you.</i>

456
00:46:32,835 --> 00:46:35,962
- Professor wolfe.
- Yes?

457
00:46:35,963 --> 00:46:38,173
- Hi. I'm Laura price.
- Hi.

458
00:46:38,215 --> 00:46:40,842
I was hoping you'd give me
a few moments of your time.

459
00:46:40,843 --> 00:46:44,428
So the other juror in the case
experienced this phenomenon as well?

460
00:46:44,429 --> 00:46:48,016
Yeah, she was convinced that
it was the killer's spirit,

461
00:46:48,058 --> 00:46:50,561
that he's angry
for what we did.

462
00:46:52,563 --> 00:46:55,231
People want to believe
in the supernatural.

463
00:46:55,232 --> 00:46:57,233
They buy my books.

464
00:46:57,234 --> 00:46:59,819
They take my class.
I've made a good living.

465
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:02,321
<i>But I want to be completely
honest with you.</i>

466
00:47:02,322 --> 00:47:05,408
99% of the hauntings
that I've investigated

467
00:47:05,409 --> 00:47:08,036
can be explained
scientifically.

468
00:47:08,078 --> 00:47:10,413
How?

469
00:47:10,414 --> 00:47:13,040
Well, there was
a laboratory in Oxford.

470
00:47:13,041 --> 00:47:15,960
Supposedly, it was haunted.

471
00:47:15,961 --> 00:47:18,087
But they found out
that their equipment

472
00:47:18,088 --> 00:47:20,423
was emitting
an ultra-low frequency

473
00:47:20,424 --> 00:47:23,301
capable of resonating
in the human eye.

474
00:47:23,302 --> 00:47:27,222
The apparition was nothing
but an optical illusion

475
00:47:27,264 --> 00:47:30,267
caused by infrasonic
vibrations.

476
00:47:31,393 --> 00:47:33,978
Okay, what about the 1%?

477
00:47:33,979 --> 00:47:37,023
What about the 1%
that can't be explained?

478
00:47:37,024 --> 00:47:40,109
Please, there's got to be
something I can do.

479
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:43,112
Entities
are trapped here

480
00:47:43,113 --> 00:47:45,114
because they want something.

481
00:47:45,115 --> 00:47:47,950
They need something
before they can move on.

482
00:47:47,951 --> 00:47:50,161
Maybe if you find out
what that is,

483
00:47:50,162 --> 00:47:52,038
you'll be able to release it.

484
00:47:52,039 --> 00:47:55,500
Well, what if
my entity--

485
00:47:55,501 --> 00:47:57,586
what if he wants to hurt me?

486
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:15,979
What did you find?

487
00:48:39,336 --> 00:48:41,213
Hmm.

488
00:48:51,014 --> 00:48:53,266
<i>Woman: St. John's hospital.
May I help you?</i>

489
00:48:53,267 --> 00:48:55,561
Um...

490
00:49:17,166 --> 00:49:20,710
I need a doctor over here!
Get him into 140.

491
00:49:20,711 --> 00:49:24,046
Excuse me, does Melissa
Miller still work here?

492
00:49:24,047 --> 00:49:27,049
No, you're gonna have to wait.
We're a few hands short.

493
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:30,345
Get some haldol over there!

494
00:49:30,387 --> 00:49:34,016
Just have a seat over here.
I'll see what I can do.

495
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:39,604
- Miss Miller?
- Ma'am, we're a little busy.

496
00:49:39,605 --> 00:49:41,690
It's about Evan.

497
00:49:45,235 --> 00:49:48,070
Thanks for sitting down
with me.

498
00:49:48,071 --> 00:49:51,407
I remember you from the trial.

499
00:49:51,408 --> 00:49:53,534
You sat in the front row,

500
00:49:53,535 --> 00:49:57,206
second from the left,
always taking notes.

501
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:59,500
You were pregnant.

502
00:50:01,502 --> 00:50:04,170
I heard about Nathan palardis.

503
00:50:04,171 --> 00:50:06,507
I couldn't believe it.

504
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:10,510
He was the foreman in the jury

505
00:50:10,511 --> 00:50:13,179
that convicted your boyfriend.

506
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:16,015
You can't tell me that there
wasn't a little part of you

507
00:50:16,016 --> 00:50:18,601
that was pleased.

508
00:50:18,602 --> 00:50:21,480
I never blamed any of you.

509
00:50:25,025 --> 00:50:26,777
Melissa...

510
00:50:29,196 --> 00:50:33,032
There's got to be
over 20 calls on here

511
00:50:33,033 --> 00:50:37,286
between you and Nathan
right before he died.

512
00:50:37,287 --> 00:50:39,622
What's this about?

513
00:50:39,623 --> 00:50:41,624
He reached out to me.

514
00:50:41,625 --> 00:50:45,044
Why?

515
00:50:45,045 --> 00:50:48,256
He wanted to know about Evan,

516
00:50:48,257 --> 00:50:52,593
about our relationship,
how we met,

517
00:50:52,594 --> 00:50:55,264
the sorts of things
we used to do together.

518
00:50:57,099 --> 00:51:00,601
Melissa, I know this might
be really difficult,

519
00:51:00,602 --> 00:51:02,812
but it would be really
helpful if you could tell me

520
00:51:02,813 --> 00:51:05,482
everything you told
Nathan, okay?

521
00:51:07,276 --> 00:51:10,361
I told him we met at the store

522
00:51:10,362 --> 00:51:13,197
<i>where he worked.</i>

523
00:51:13,198 --> 00:51:16,075
I was trying to paint

524
00:51:16,076 --> 00:51:18,077
one of my sister's bedrooms.

525
00:51:18,078 --> 00:51:20,079
She had a baby on the way.

526
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,081
<i>And I remember she wanted</i>

527
00:51:22,082 --> 00:51:24,293
<i>this very particular
shade of blue.</i>

528
00:51:27,796 --> 00:51:31,841
I was there, you know,

529
00:51:31,842 --> 00:51:34,510
when they put the needle
in his arm.

530
00:51:34,511 --> 00:51:37,597
I watched the chemicals
pumping through the iv,

531
00:51:37,598 --> 00:51:41,225
knowing it was gonna kill him.

532
00:51:41,226 --> 00:51:44,313
In those final moments,
he looked up at me

533
00:51:44,354 --> 00:51:47,441
<i>through the glass...</i>

534
00:51:49,443 --> 00:51:52,446
And he blew me a kiss.

535
00:51:55,699 --> 00:51:59,285
I miss him.
I miss him so much.

536
00:51:59,286 --> 00:52:02,580
Melissa, do you remember

537
00:52:02,581 --> 00:52:04,583
his last words?

538
00:52:07,586 --> 00:52:10,172
He said,

539
00:52:10,214 --> 00:52:14,258
"if there is a God,

540
00:52:14,259 --> 00:52:17,513
whence proceed
so many evils?"

541
00:52:23,519 --> 00:52:27,313
"If there is a God, whence
proceed so many evils?

542
00:52:27,314 --> 00:52:30,734
If there is no God,
whence cometh any good?"

543
00:52:33,237 --> 00:52:34,863
Boethius?

544
00:52:48,293 --> 00:52:50,294
<i>"A Roman philosopher,</i>

545
00:52:50,295 --> 00:52:52,548
<i>was wrongfully imprisoned
and sentenced to death."</i>

546
00:52:55,926 --> 00:52:58,178
Wrongfully imprisoned.

547
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:55,730
Hey, there's a lady
here to see you--

548
00:55:55,731 --> 00:55:58,566
<i>uh, Lynn? Lacey?</i>

549
00:55:58,567 --> 00:56:00,568
Laura.

550
00:56:00,569 --> 00:56:02,738
Yeah, that's it.

551
00:56:09,036 --> 00:56:12,414
Are you coming back or do you want
me to close out your session?

552
00:56:19,463 --> 00:56:21,381
Huh.

553
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:32,100
Hey.

554
00:56:32,142 --> 00:56:36,103
There's years' worth
of research in here.

555
00:56:36,104 --> 00:56:38,481
I want to retrace
Nathan's steps.

556
00:56:38,482 --> 00:56:41,901
I want to interview anyone and everyone
who ever testified in this trial.

557
00:56:41,902 --> 00:56:43,903
I can't just reopen this case.

558
00:56:43,904 --> 00:56:46,782
Why? What if Nathan
was onto something?

559
00:56:46,824 --> 00:56:49,784
What if something didn't add up? I
think that's why he circled my name--

560
00:56:49,785 --> 00:56:52,745
because I was the only one who
questioned anything during that trial.

561
00:56:52,746 --> 00:56:54,998
But ultimately
you chose "guilty."

562
00:56:57,042 --> 00:56:59,586
Yeah, I know.

563
00:57:03,006 --> 00:57:06,969
What if--
what if we were wrong?

564
00:57:08,846 --> 00:57:11,598
What if we convicted
the wrong man?

565
00:57:14,685 --> 00:57:16,478
Are you okay?

566
00:57:24,153 --> 00:57:26,904
Do you really think clearing
Evan's name will save your life?

567
00:57:26,905 --> 00:57:30,825
I know that it sounds crazy,

568
00:57:30,826 --> 00:57:33,662
but, yeah, I do.

569
00:57:35,831 --> 00:57:37,875
Let's go.

570
00:57:39,501 --> 00:57:42,171
Everybody loved him.
He was always very helpful.

571
00:57:42,212 --> 00:57:44,714
He was probably one
of my best employees.

572
00:57:44,715 --> 00:57:46,716
How long did Evan work for you?

573
00:57:46,717 --> 00:57:49,510
About three years, I'd say.

574
00:57:49,511 --> 00:57:51,512
He started off as a clerk

575
00:57:51,513 --> 00:57:53,723
and then he worked his way
on up to assistant manager.

576
00:57:53,724 --> 00:57:56,684
Mr. Harris, have you seen those spinner
blades that came in this morning?

577
00:57:56,685 --> 00:57:58,144
I sure have.
Did you check aisle 3?

578
00:57:58,145 --> 00:57:59,604
- Thanks.
- Okay.

579
00:57:59,605 --> 00:58:02,106
The shipment of
the murder weapon

580
00:58:02,107 --> 00:58:04,108
was traced back to this store.

581
00:58:04,109 --> 00:58:06,569
Yeah, it was a three-inch
healey fisherman.

582
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:08,988
We still carry those.
I'll show you.

583
00:58:08,989 --> 00:58:11,867
We go through about
a case of those a month--

584
00:58:11,909 --> 00:58:15,495
collectors, fishermen. Heck, we
even got a guy over in sausalito--

585
00:58:15,496 --> 00:58:18,040
this guy-- he can carve your
initials right there in the tooth.

586
00:58:18,081 --> 00:58:20,501
- Can you believe that?
- Wow.

587
00:58:25,631 --> 00:58:27,673
Did Evan have access
to that key?

588
00:58:27,674 --> 00:58:30,886
All my employees do.

589
00:58:32,262 --> 00:58:34,932
Healey three-inch
fisherman-- there it is.

590
00:58:35,974 --> 00:58:38,559
This case is spotless.

591
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:41,230
- Well, thank you.
- How often, would you say, you clean it?

592
00:58:41,271 --> 00:58:43,147
We clean this at least
once a week,

593
00:58:43,148 --> 00:58:45,608
pour the product out,
wipe it down,

594
00:58:45,609 --> 00:58:49,738
and most importantly, make sure
the blades are nice and shiny.

595
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:51,614
Whose job would that be?

596
00:58:51,615 --> 00:58:53,157
That would be my assistant.

597
00:58:53,158 --> 00:58:55,744
So it would have been
Evan's job?

598
00:58:55,786 --> 00:58:59,121
- At that time, yes, ma'am.
- So if Evan cleaned the case...

599
00:58:59,122 --> 00:59:01,249
He would have gotten his
fingerprints on the knife.

600
00:59:02,793 --> 00:59:04,753
You were fishing
off Duxbury reef

601
00:59:04,795 --> 00:59:07,046
the day the midnight murderer
dumped his last victim?

602
00:59:07,047 --> 00:59:09,090
Yeah, he took her over
to the edge of the dock,

603
00:59:09,091 --> 00:59:11,050
dumped her body in the ocean.

604
00:59:11,051 --> 00:59:13,719
Says you were interviewed by the
police for over five hours.

605
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:17,766
Yeah, that one detective,
the black guy-- Calloway?

606
00:59:17,808 --> 00:59:20,143
- Callendar.
- Yeah, he was very thorough.

607
00:59:20,144 --> 00:59:22,895
Anyways, like he said
on the stand,

608
00:59:22,896 --> 00:59:25,648
they found that poor girl's
body wrapped in plastic

609
00:59:25,649 --> 00:59:27,650
exactly where I said it was.

610
00:59:27,651 --> 00:59:30,027
Is this what you were fishing
the day you saw the killer?

611
00:59:30,028 --> 00:59:31,779
Yeah.

612
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:35,117
Caught a couple monsters
too-- 25-30 pounds.

613
00:59:35,159 --> 00:59:37,201
The trick is, you put a sinker
on the end of your line--

614
00:59:37,202 --> 00:59:39,203
it gets right down in there.

615
00:59:39,204 --> 00:59:41,123
How far offshore
would you say you were?

616
00:59:41,165 --> 00:59:43,666
I don't know, about 100 feet.

617
00:59:43,667 --> 00:59:45,668
Yeah, that's weird.

618
00:59:45,669 --> 00:59:47,211
Why?

619
00:59:47,212 --> 00:59:49,798
I used to fish with my dad
when I was a little girl,

620
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:52,134
and that, my friend, is COD.

621
00:59:52,176 --> 00:59:53,718
Yeah.

622
00:59:53,719 --> 00:59:55,720
And?

623
00:59:55,721 --> 00:59:58,055
And the schools concentrate
out on the shelf,

624
00:59:58,056 --> 01:00:01,767
and that's no less than 700
feet away, wouldn't you say?

625
01:00:01,768 --> 01:00:04,271
Is that true?

626
01:00:06,732 --> 01:00:08,733
Look, I know what I saw.

627
01:00:08,734 --> 01:00:10,819
The guy was well-built,
kind of tall.

628
01:00:10,861 --> 01:00:12,987
Did you actually see his face?

629
01:00:12,988 --> 01:00:15,364
Ask callendar.
I ID'd the photo.

630
01:00:15,365 --> 01:00:18,035
What color eyes did he have?

631
01:00:19,244 --> 01:00:21,829
Did you see what color
his eyes were?

632
01:00:21,830 --> 01:00:24,207
Look, lady, I could never
have seen that,

633
01:00:24,208 --> 01:00:26,001
not even from 100 feet away.

634
01:00:26,043 --> 01:00:28,836
Really? Because I remember
you on the stand

635
01:00:28,837 --> 01:00:31,173
saying they were hazel.

636
01:00:32,841 --> 01:00:35,177
Mark gannon--

637
01:00:35,219 --> 01:00:37,720
there's a name I haven't
heard in a while.

638
01:00:37,721 --> 01:00:40,349
Hey, why don't you guys
come back in the cage?

639
01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:44,060
Yeah, he was transferred
after his testimony

640
01:00:44,061 --> 01:00:47,356
at the midnight trial.
Lucky him--

641
01:00:47,397 --> 01:00:49,899
pleasant valley down in Fresno.

642
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:52,736
Yeah, here we go.

643
01:00:55,948 --> 01:00:58,741
Uh, arrested for
breaking and entering,

644
01:00:58,742 --> 01:01:01,869
assault and battery,
attempted murder.

645
01:01:01,870 --> 01:01:04,039
This guy gets a transfer.

646
01:01:04,081 --> 01:01:06,207
Says here he testified

647
01:01:06,208 --> 01:01:08,209
for the prosecution
in four criminal trials

648
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:10,211
in addition to
the midnight case.

649
01:01:10,212 --> 01:01:12,880
Why, he's a real advocate
for justice, isn't he?

650
01:01:12,881 --> 01:01:16,718
Eh, these guys are locked up in
cement boxes 23 hours a day.

651
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:19,804
<i>They start talking.
Everyone does.</i>

652
01:01:19,805 --> 01:01:22,391
Mark saw an opportunity.

653
01:01:22,432 --> 01:01:26,061
Would you have his
visitor log by chance?

654
01:01:26,103 --> 01:01:28,981
Yeah, I should.

655
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:36,946
You think someone told mark what to
say in exchange for the transfer?

656
01:01:36,947 --> 01:01:39,031
Yeah, I do, just like I think

657
01:01:39,032 --> 01:01:41,951
somebody told the fisherman
what color Evan's eyes were.

658
01:01:41,952 --> 01:01:45,413
Well, you know, this is
what frustrates me.

659
01:01:45,414 --> 01:01:47,373
<i>- What's that?
- The log--</i>

660
01:01:47,374 --> 01:01:49,251
it's missing.

661
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:57,925
So what do we have?

662
01:01:57,926 --> 01:02:01,763
Looks like a forensic
investigator testified

663
01:02:01,805 --> 01:02:04,974
that Evan's prints were present
on both the blade and the handle.

664
01:02:04,975 --> 01:02:07,727
Well, that could have
happened at the store.

665
01:02:07,728 --> 01:02:09,729
Yeah, but according
to Nathan's notes,

666
01:02:09,730 --> 01:02:12,816
there were also several partial
prints that were never matched.

667
01:02:14,485 --> 01:02:16,903
That wasn't in
the forensic testimony.

668
01:02:16,904 --> 01:02:19,864
Including one
on one of the bags

669
01:02:19,865 --> 01:02:22,200
pulled out of the landfill.

670
01:02:22,201 --> 01:02:25,745
And one more thing-- Evan's
girlfriend told Nathan

671
01:02:25,746 --> 01:02:27,956
the police served a search
warrant at their apartment,

672
01:02:27,998 --> 01:02:30,291
took several items with them,
except there's no reference

673
01:02:30,292 --> 01:02:32,293
to anything
in the evidence log.

674
01:02:32,294 --> 01:02:34,463
They just disappeared.

675
01:02:35,422 --> 01:02:38,216
Wow.

676
01:02:38,217 --> 01:02:40,469
They covered it up.

677
01:02:40,511 --> 01:02:43,430
Yeah.

678
01:02:44,973 --> 01:02:48,893
Can you imagine
being convicted,

679
01:02:48,894 --> 01:02:52,022
being executed for
something you didn't do?

680
01:02:57,528 --> 01:03:00,363
Evan's put to death.

681
01:03:00,364 --> 01:03:02,365
The prosecutor
Charles Richardson

682
01:03:02,366 --> 01:03:04,493
is serving his
second term as d.A.

683
01:03:04,535 --> 01:03:06,995
If it were me,
I'd want revenge.

684
01:03:11,416 --> 01:03:14,211
Tomorrow's day three.

685
01:03:16,171 --> 01:03:18,130
What are we gonna do?

686
01:03:18,131 --> 01:03:20,467
We're gonna finish this.

687
01:03:30,394 --> 01:03:32,979
So what do you think?

688
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:35,273
I worked for over a year
on that case,

689
01:03:35,274 --> 01:03:37,275
interviewed hundreds
of witnesses,

690
01:03:37,276 --> 01:03:38,985
dozens of suspects.

691
01:03:38,986 --> 01:03:41,070
You want to tell me
what was so urgent,

692
01:03:41,071 --> 01:03:43,949
you had to wake me up
in the middle of the night?

693
01:03:46,243 --> 01:03:49,037
Look, I'm obviously
not a detective.

694
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:50,831
No.

695
01:03:52,416 --> 01:03:55,210
You have a witness who clearly
lied about what he saw,

696
01:03:55,252 --> 01:03:57,420
partial prints
on the murder weapon

697
01:03:57,421 --> 01:03:59,881
that weren't even
accurately examined,

698
01:03:59,882 --> 01:04:03,218
and evidence that just
kind of disappeared.

699
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:06,220
Hmm, and a jailhouse confession

700
01:04:06,221 --> 01:04:09,057
in which Lucas told
his cellmate everything--

701
01:04:09,099 --> 01:04:13,144
how he chose his victims,
where he hid the bodies.

702
01:04:13,145 --> 01:04:16,105
You don't think mark gannon could
have read that in "the examiner"?

703
01:04:16,106 --> 01:04:19,192
Including the details we
didn't release to the public?

704
01:04:19,193 --> 01:04:23,905
You know, I don't mean
any disrespect, detective.

705
01:04:23,906 --> 01:04:27,159
Did you actually interview
Mr. gannon yourself?

706
01:04:29,077 --> 01:04:32,622
Tell me she's not serious.
Of course I did.

707
01:04:32,623 --> 01:04:36,126
Was that before or after
somebody told him what to say?

708
01:04:37,252 --> 01:04:39,545
Are you listening to this?

709
01:04:39,546 --> 01:04:43,090
Come on, John, you gotta admit there
are a couple of holes in the case.

710
01:04:43,091 --> 01:04:45,468
A couple?
Come on.

711
01:04:45,469 --> 01:04:48,888
Midnight murderer had
the whole city on edge.

712
01:04:48,889 --> 01:04:50,890
Every time you turned on the TV

713
01:04:50,891 --> 01:04:53,101
or opened a newspaper,

714
01:04:53,143 --> 01:04:55,436
we were pulling another
body out of the bay.

715
01:04:55,437 --> 01:04:59,106
You know, people were
afraid to go outside.

716
01:04:59,107 --> 01:05:01,108
They stopped going to work.

717
01:05:01,109 --> 01:05:04,403
Kids stopped going to school.

718
01:05:04,404 --> 01:05:06,531
Was there pressure
from the d.A.

719
01:05:06,532 --> 01:05:08,908
To wrap it up?
Absolutely.

720
01:05:08,909 --> 01:05:11,577
Did I cut a few corners?
Possibly.

721
01:05:11,578 --> 01:05:13,996
But before you come down on me,

722
01:05:13,997 --> 01:05:17,416
waking me up in my own home,

723
01:05:17,417 --> 01:05:19,919
you need to remember one thing.

724
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:22,588
And what's that?

725
01:05:22,589 --> 01:05:26,217
The moment we took Evan Lucas,

726
01:05:26,218 --> 01:05:28,219
put him into custody,

727
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:30,389
the murders stopped.

728
01:05:34,601 --> 01:05:36,311
<i>Man: No.</i>

729
01:05:36,353 --> 01:05:38,313
No. Well,
you just tell them

730
01:05:38,355 --> 01:05:41,149
I'm not gonna budge,
not for that.

731
01:05:41,150 --> 01:05:44,443
No. No, they're gonna have
to work a little bit harder.

732
01:05:44,444 --> 01:05:46,445
<i>Sorry, that's the way it is.</i>

733
01:05:46,446 --> 01:05:48,447
- Charles.
- I'll call you back.

734
01:05:48,448 --> 01:05:50,449
- Hey, John, good to see you.
- You too, buddy.

735
01:05:50,450 --> 01:05:52,494
We missed you at the
fund-raiser last month.

736
01:05:52,536 --> 01:05:55,497
Yeah, well, listen, I need to
talk to you about Evan Lucas.

737
01:05:55,539 --> 01:05:57,707
Hey, I'm a busy man. You know what?
Why don't you call Amy,

738
01:05:57,708 --> 01:05:59,625
set up a lunch? We'll go to Danko.
You like that.

739
01:05:59,626 --> 01:06:01,627
No, no, I mean now.

740
01:06:01,628 --> 01:06:04,005
- Now?
- Now. Now.

741
01:06:04,006 --> 01:06:07,176
All right, well, if you don't
mind talking in my other office.

742
01:06:07,217 --> 01:06:09,261
After you.

743
01:06:16,685 --> 01:06:19,020
All right, so what's
troubling you, John?

744
01:06:19,021 --> 01:06:22,190
Don't tell me that juror
suicide has you spooked.

745
01:06:22,191 --> 01:06:24,233
Hmm, you heard about it.

746
01:06:24,234 --> 01:06:27,069
<i>Half the people in my office
are talking about it.</i>

747
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:29,071
<i>They think there's a curse,</i>

748
01:06:29,072 --> 01:06:31,073
<i>if you believe in
that kind of thing.</i>

749
01:06:31,074 --> 01:06:33,493
I don't.
You?

750
01:06:33,494 --> 01:06:36,329
<i>I believe
in two things, John:</i>

751
01:06:36,330 --> 01:06:38,748
<i>Justice and the death penalty.</i>

752
01:06:38,749 --> 01:06:41,209
<i>Everything else is just smoke</i>

753
01:06:41,210 --> 01:06:44,128
<i>- and mirrors.</i>

754
01:06:44,129 --> 01:06:47,298
So what's this really about?

755
01:06:47,299 --> 01:06:50,218
Mark gannon.

756
01:06:50,219 --> 01:06:54,056
Yeah, he's doing life in
Fresno last time I heard.

757
01:06:54,097 --> 01:06:56,225
Eh, minimum security.

758
01:06:56,266 --> 01:06:58,060
The guy's 5'4".

759
01:06:58,101 --> 01:07:01,020
He's got arthritis
worse than my grandmother.

760
01:07:01,021 --> 01:07:03,314
I still think he had
the right friends.

761
01:07:03,315 --> 01:07:06,651
These are hardened
criminals, John.

762
01:07:06,652 --> 01:07:09,612
We're not gonna win them over
with "please" and "thank you."

763
01:07:09,613 --> 01:07:11,614
You're right.

764
01:07:11,615 --> 01:07:14,742
Hey, did you know
his visitor's log

765
01:07:14,743 --> 01:07:17,079
in the jailhouse archives
was missing?

766
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:19,748
Half the city's understaffed.

767
01:07:19,790 --> 01:07:22,708
Clerical's a mess. I don't
even know how I do my job.

768
01:07:22,709 --> 01:07:25,087
Yeah, so I checked
the front logs.

769
01:07:26,588 --> 01:07:28,589
You want to guess
who visited him

770
01:07:28,590 --> 01:07:32,761
right before he gave up
Evan's confession?

771
01:07:32,803 --> 01:07:35,097
Five years later,

772
01:07:35,139 --> 01:07:37,099
and you want to have
this conversation now?

773
01:07:37,141 --> 01:07:39,142
- Did you coach him, Charles?
- You were with me.

774
01:07:39,143 --> 01:07:41,185
You know the evidence
better than I do.

775
01:07:41,186 --> 01:07:43,187
It wasn't enough,

776
01:07:43,188 --> 01:07:45,565
not until the cellmate
came forward--

777
01:07:45,566 --> 01:07:48,151
came forward and told
everybody Evan confessed.

778
01:07:48,152 --> 01:07:51,113
We convicted a guilty man.

779
01:07:51,155 --> 01:07:53,072
You swore to me.

780
01:07:53,073 --> 01:07:55,074
You assured me
that you had testimony

781
01:07:55,075 --> 01:07:57,535
proving his guilt.

782
01:07:57,536 --> 01:07:59,537
That was a lie.

783
01:07:59,538 --> 01:08:02,291
I suppose your conscience
would prefer more people die.

784
01:08:02,332 --> 01:08:04,626
Like Evan Lucas?

785
01:08:07,421 --> 01:08:10,381
What are you gonna do,
John, huh?

786
01:08:10,382 --> 01:08:12,758
Destroy your reputation,

787
01:08:12,759 --> 01:08:15,720
jeopardize everything you've spent
your whole career building?

788
01:08:15,721 --> 01:08:18,849
I'm just gonna deny everything.

789
01:08:20,851 --> 01:08:24,104
Because that's what politicians
do best now, isn't it?

790
01:08:27,608 --> 01:08:29,817
<i>Male reporter: City

791
01:08:29,818 --> 01:08:31,819

792
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:33,821

800
01:08:56,303 --> 01:08:58,304
hello.

801
01:08:58,305 --> 01:09:01,182
Hey, vick.

802
01:09:01,183 --> 01:09:03,519
Yeah, I changed it.

803
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:06,854
What's up?

804
01:09:06,855 --> 01:09:10,192
Oh, I can't.
I have plans tonight.

805
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:13,694
Michael's here.

806
01:09:13,695 --> 01:09:16,364
Yeah.

807
01:09:16,365 --> 01:09:18,616
Well, tomorrow, okay?

808
01:09:18,617 --> 01:09:21,203
Tomorrow.
Bye.

809
01:09:23,747 --> 01:09:25,748
That was my
girlfriend Vicki--

810
01:09:25,749 --> 01:09:28,167
<i>the one that works
at the art gallery.</i>

811
01:09:28,168 --> 01:09:31,170
She may be doing the background
check on you right now.

812
01:09:31,171 --> 01:09:33,422
I'm just letting you know.

813
01:09:33,423 --> 01:09:35,675
Well, unfortunately

814
01:09:35,676 --> 01:09:37,760
one of the side effects
of being a cop is

815
01:09:37,761 --> 01:09:40,680
you tend to lead a pretty
boring personal life.

816
01:09:40,681 --> 01:09:42,682
Well, after the week I've had,

817
01:09:42,683 --> 01:09:45,185
I can handle boring.

818
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:53,402
I'll show you how this works.

819
01:09:54,361 --> 01:09:56,321
Here.

820
01:09:59,783 --> 01:10:01,784
Really? Let me see
if I can do it.

821
01:10:01,785 --> 01:10:03,786
I'm not sure.
Um...

822
01:10:03,787 --> 01:10:06,748
Yeah, okay.
Thank you.

823
01:10:25,976 --> 01:10:27,977
What time is it?

824
01:10:27,978 --> 01:10:29,979
What?

825
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:32,441
What time is it?

826
01:10:33,358 --> 01:10:36,445
Um, 2:00.

827
01:10:36,487 --> 01:10:38,821
Why?

828
01:10:38,822 --> 01:10:41,574
Day three.

829
01:10:41,575 --> 01:10:43,618
You were right.

830
01:10:43,619 --> 01:10:45,996
<i>- Clearing his name saved your life.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

831
01:10:50,417 --> 01:10:53,462
Maybe now he's at peace.

832
01:10:53,504 --> 01:10:55,547
And you?

833
01:10:58,550 --> 01:11:00,636
Getting there.

834
01:11:18,403 --> 01:11:21,614
Hey, it's me.
Call me back asap.

835
01:11:21,615 --> 01:11:23,992
I think I found something.

836
01:11:25,911 --> 01:11:28,496
He told us where
you hid the bodies.

837
01:11:28,497 --> 01:11:30,498
I don't know what
you're talking about.

838
01:11:30,499 --> 01:11:32,501
Look, this--
is that your knife?

839
01:11:32,543 --> 01:11:35,378
Hey, we've got a witness

840
01:11:35,379 --> 01:11:37,380
saying he saw you take
the Hamilton girl

841
01:11:37,381 --> 01:11:40,424
off Duxbury reef,
toss her body in the water.

842
01:11:40,425 --> 01:11:43,469
No, man.
No way.

843
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:47,849
You know, the next time
your girl is gonna see you,

844
01:11:47,850 --> 01:11:51,603
they're gonna be sticking
a needle in your arm.

845
01:11:52,938 --> 01:11:55,731
Fine. You don't
want to play?

846
01:11:55,732 --> 01:11:59,861
Fine. We'll do it
your way.

847

<i>I can't help you, homie.</i>

848
01:12:17,421 --> 01:12:19,506

He's not picking up.

867

Okay.

- Where are all the files?
- They're gone.

875
01:16:39,725 --> 01:16:41,726
He wasn't supposed
to take those.

<i>Son of a bitch.</i>

881
01:17:35,864 --> 01:17:38,783
Officer, do me a favor.

882
01:17:38,784 --> 01:17:41,202
I need you to call down to Santa
Cruz, see if they found any prints.

883
01:17:41,203 --> 01:17:43,246
- Also see if the knife matches.
- Detective?

884
01:17:43,247 --> 01:17:45,332
- Just do it.
- I'm on it.

885
01:17:51,672 --> 01:17:53,673
Pick up.

886
01:17:53,674 --> 01:17:55,217
Pick up. Pick up.

887
01:17:55,259 --> 01:17:57,844
<i>Hi. This is Laura.
Please leave me a message.</i>

888
01:17:57,845 --> 01:18:00,263
Hey, it's me.
You're still in danger.

889
01:18:00,264 --> 01:18:03,266
You have to get out of the house.
Please call me.

890
01:18:05,269 --> 01:18:07,728
<i>- Lyons.
- The knife used in the Martinez suicide</i>

891
01:18:07,729 --> 01:18:09,856
<i>was the same
as the midnight case.</i>

892
01:18:09,857 --> 01:18:12,191
<i>- What about prints in the tub?
- Got a match in our files.</i>

893
01:18:12,192 --> 01:18:15,028
<i>- Which one?
- Evan's boss George Harris.</i>

894
01:20:31,540 --> 01:20:33,917
Hello, Laura.

895
01:20:56,899 --> 01:21:00,526
<i>I knew Nathan was close
to finding the truth, Laura.</i>

896
01:21:00,527 --> 01:21:03,613
<i>But it would have been
too risky to just kill him.</i>

897
01:21:03,614 --> 01:21:06,324
So I decided
to come out of retirement--

898
01:21:06,325 --> 01:21:11,204
<i>the midnight murderer
back from the grave,</i>

899
01:21:11,205 --> 01:21:13,873
killing off the jury in order.

900
01:21:13,874 --> 01:21:18,044
<i>And you, Laura--
you're number five.</i>

901
01:21:18,045 --> 01:21:20,130
Are you in there, Laura?

902
01:22:12,141 --> 01:22:14,184
Laura?

903
01:22:18,147 --> 01:22:20,232
Are you in there, Laura?

904
01:22:21,233 --> 01:22:23,318
Open the door.

905
01:22:33,245 --> 01:22:35,414
<i>Where are you hiding, Laura?</i>

906
01:22:56,518 --> 01:22:59,062
Where could you be?

907
01:23:09,698 --> 01:23:12,201
Laura, Laura, you naughty girl.

908
01:23:18,499 --> 01:23:20,584
Laura!

909
01:23:21,585 --> 01:23:23,670
Where are you?

910
01:24:02,459 --> 01:24:06,255
Laura. Laura.

911
01:24:25,691 --> 01:24:29,153
<i>Michael:
Put the knife down!</i>

912
01:24:46,670 --> 01:24:48,797
Are you okay?

913
01:25:22,247 --> 01:25:24,625
How are you holding up?

914
01:25:25,876 --> 01:25:27,836
Better.

915
01:25:29,505 --> 01:25:32,840
This whole time he was
trying to keep us safe.

916
01:25:35,385 --> 01:25:38,388
George.
I heard.

917
01:25:39,515 --> 01:25:42,141
Evan wanted me to tell you

918
01:25:42,142 --> 01:25:44,686
thank you.

919
01:25:47,523 --> 01:25:50,859
I'm just sorry we couldn't
have helped him earlier.

920
01:25:52,528 --> 01:25:54,570
There's something else.

921
01:25:54,571 --> 01:25:55,864
What?

922
01:25:57,866 --> 01:26:00,409
He said

923
01:26:00,410 --> 01:26:03,288
your son is there with him...

924
01:26:05,165 --> 01:26:08,167
And that he is looking forward
to being with his mommy

925
01:26:08,168 --> 01:26:10,629
when the time comes.

926
01:26:12,881 --> 01:26:15,425
Until then, he'll keep
an eye on him for you.

927
01:26:18,679 --> 01:26:21,305
Well,

928
01:26:21,306 --> 01:26:24,392
you tell him to tell Jacob

929
01:26:24,393 --> 01:26:27,395
that there's not a minute
that goes by in my day

930
01:26:27,396 --> 01:26:30,565
that I don't think about him.

931
01:26:30,566 --> 01:26:33,694
Tell him that his mommy
loves him very much.

932
01:26:36,488 --> 01:26:38,949
I will.
