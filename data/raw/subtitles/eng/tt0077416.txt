1
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,606
How ya doin'?

2
00:04:06,606 --> 00:04:11,174
Hey, watch out, Axel. We'll be
calling him old fireballs after tonight.

3
00:04:11,174 --> 00:04:13,398
- Fuckin' A.
- Not bad.

4
00:04:15,304 --> 00:04:17,171
Hey, Stevie,
now that you're going to the army,

5
00:04:17,171 --> 00:04:19,077
how about givin'
my 20 bucks back?

6
00:04:27,576 --> 00:04:29,761
- So long, Mike.
- Take care, Mike.

7
00:04:29,761 --> 00:04:31,667
I'll see ya, fellas.

8
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:34,407
- Freddy!
- Hi, Mike. Be good.

9
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:37,465
- You hear about the happy Roman?
- Yeah.

10
00:04:37,465 --> 00:04:40,047
- He was "glad he ate her."
- Come on. Let's go, let's go.

11
00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:42,152
- Where's Stan? Hey, Stan!
- I don't know.

12
00:04:42,152 --> 00:04:44,058
- I'll see you later.
- Take care.

13
00:04:44,058 --> 00:04:46,044
Nick! Write us.

14
00:04:46,044 --> 00:04:47,950
- Take care of yourself, okay?
- Bye-bye.

15
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:50,214
- So long.
- Take it easy, Mike.

16
00:04:50,214 --> 00:04:53,391
- Don't get your ass shot off, Okay? Good luck.
- Okay, I won't.

17
00:04:53,391 --> 00:04:57,641
Hey! Say, Mike, take care of yourself.
Good luck to you.

18
00:04:57,641 --> 00:04:59,865
- Kill a few for me too.
- I will. Stay out of trouble.

19
00:04:59,865 --> 00:05:01,771
Hey, little killer.

20
00:05:01,771 --> 00:05:04,115
Stevie! Hey!

21
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,404
Hey, Axel, there's Stan.
Stanley!

22
00:05:08,404 --> 00:05:11,263
- Stanley, you asshole.
- Hey, Stan!

23
00:05:11,263 --> 00:05:14,600
Stan, it's no use!

24
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,982
Come on, Stosh.
You're beautiful now.

25
00:05:16,982 --> 00:05:19,008
You're still
an ugly bastard, Stan!

26
00:05:19,008 --> 00:05:20,875
Good luck to you
in the army, man.

27
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,781
Get Stanley, Axel.

28
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:24,608
Come on. Come on.

29
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,547
Get the hell outta here.

30
00:05:27,547 --> 00:05:31,360
Come on, Stan. Let's go.

31
00:05:32,789 --> 00:05:36,523
Very mature. Very mature,
well-adapted individual, Stosh.

32
00:05:36,523 --> 00:05:38,906
- Take it easy.
- Whoa.

33
00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:42,401
Hey! Look at that! Whoa!
What the hell is that?

34
00:05:42,401 --> 00:05:44,307
Where? Oh, yeah.

35
00:05:45,657 --> 00:05:49,271
Holy shit. You know what that is?
Those are sun dogs.

36
00:05:49,271 --> 00:05:50,304
What does it mean?

37
00:05:50,304 --> 00:05:54,117
A blessing on the hunter sent by
the great wolf to his children.

38
00:05:54,117 --> 00:05:57,651
- What the fuck are you talkin' about?
- It's an old lndian thing.

39
00:05:57,651 --> 00:06:00,114
You're full of shit.

40
00:06:00,114 --> 00:06:03,251
Stanley, would I shit you
about something like that?

41
00:06:03,251 --> 00:06:05,158
You know, Mike,

42
00:06:05,158 --> 00:06:07,938
there's times when nobody but a doctor
can understand you.

43
00:06:07,938 --> 00:06:09,844
That's an omen,
you know that?

44
00:06:09,844 --> 00:06:13,180
We can have one great
fucking hunting trip tonight.

45
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,199
Mike, I don't know
where you come up with all this.

46
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,423
Hey, wait a minute.

47
00:06:18,423 --> 00:06:21,560
What? Are you thinking of
going deer huntin' tonight?

48
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,698
Not tonight.
I'm gettin' married tonight.

49
00:06:24,698 --> 00:06:26,683
-You fuckin' guys would go deer huntin'.
-Hey, hey.

50
00:06:26,683 --> 00:06:29,265
First we get you legal.
Tuck you into bed with Angela.

51
00:06:29,265 --> 00:06:31,171
Hey, baby.

52
00:06:31,171 --> 00:06:33,078
You guys are fuckin' nuts.
You know that?

53
00:06:33,078 --> 00:06:34,984
- Boy, you're all crazy.
- Life is over.

54
00:06:34,984 --> 00:06:37,844
Yeah, right.
You're gettin' married. We're crazy.

55
00:06:37,844 --> 00:06:40,584
It's all right.
Hey, it's all right.

56
00:06:40,584 --> 00:06:44,039
We'll be right with you, all of us, won't we?
Right? Am I right?

57
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:46,382
- Right.
- Fuckin' A, man.

58
00:06:46,382 --> 00:06:48,686
Come on. Come on, you guys.

59
00:06:48,686 --> 00:06:51,347
- I'm buying the first round this morning.
- Hey, Steven!

60
00:06:51,347 --> 00:06:54,604
Any help you might need tonight,
just feel free to call on me.

61
00:06:54,604 --> 00:06:57,940
Hey, Stanley, sometimes
your sense of humor ain't funny.

62
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,323
- Come on, Steven.
- Willing fingers.

63
00:07:00,323 --> 00:07:02,189
Extra lips.

64
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:04,096
Fuckin' A, man.

65
00:07:04,096 --> 00:07:07,154
- Hey, you're a regular poet, Axel.
- I couldn't agree with you more.

66
00:07:07,154 --> 00:07:09,060
- Get in the car.
- Come on. Come on.

67
00:07:14,104 --> 00:07:15,931
I do.

68
00:07:17,917 --> 00:07:19,744
I do.

69
00:07:22,206 --> 00:07:24,033
I do.

70
00:07:34,756 --> 00:07:37,536
Oh, my God.

71
00:07:48,577 --> 00:07:51,159
I still do not
believe this.

72
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:54,296
My own boy
with a strange girl.

73
00:07:54,296 --> 00:07:58,665
And not so thin, if you understand
my meaning. Not such a thin girl.

74
00:07:58,665 --> 00:08:02,875
The next thing you know,
he goes to Vietnam.

75
00:08:05,337 --> 00:08:08,197
I do not understand, Father.

76
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:13,519
I understand
nothing anymore. Nothing!

77
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:21,541
Why?

78
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:26,108
Can you explain?
Can anyone explain?

79
00:08:52,082 --> 00:08:54,585
- Pass him on the inside.
- Oh-oh, you'd never do it.

80
00:08:54,585 --> 00:08:56,173
Shut up.

81
00:08:56,173 --> 00:08:58,556
- It's your Caddy against my truck.
- Is today your lucky day?

82
00:08:58,556 --> 00:09:00,462
You can't make it.

83
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:19,049
Hey, hey, Axel,
you owe him a window.

84
00:09:19,049 --> 00:09:21,909
Mike! Mike!
Hey, mighty Mike!

85
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:23,895
- Oh, Axel.
- Here's your truck back.

86
00:09:23,895 --> 00:09:25,801
Oh, hell, I hope
he didn't break an axle.

87
00:09:25,801 --> 00:09:28,184
I wouldn't want
to take advantage of you.

88
00:09:28,184 --> 00:09:30,487
It's a million-to-one shot
against a sure thing.

89
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:32,394
- There's no such thing as a sure thing.
- Yeah.

90
00:09:32,394 --> 00:09:34,260
Did you see that?

91
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:38,073
- Hey, Boom!
- Hey, how ya doin'?

92
00:09:38,748 --> 00:09:40,655
Don't take anybody's money!

93
00:09:40,655 --> 00:09:44,467
- Don't take my money. Take his money.
- Set 'em up.

94
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:48,280
- Kessler and a Rolling Rock.
- Kessler and a Rolling Rock.

95
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,941
Give him a short one.

96
00:09:50,941 --> 00:09:53,125
And give my friends down here
my warm regards.

97
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,508
- John!
- Aaah!

98
00:09:59,718 --> 00:10:04,365
Hey, I got a hundred bucks says the Eagles
never cross the 50 in the next half.

99
00:10:04,365 --> 00:10:06,748
And the Steelers win
by what? Twenty.

100
00:10:06,748 --> 00:10:10,561
I got an extra 20 says
the Eagles' quarterback wears a dress!

101
00:10:12,824 --> 00:10:15,684
Take your money off the bar.
Drinks are on the house!

102
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,871
- Oh, did I get all wet?
- No. I don't know.

103
00:10:49,522 --> 00:10:51,785
Come on, Amy!

104
00:10:55,678 --> 00:10:57,504
Come on!

105
00:10:59,689 --> 00:11:03,422
Uh, Joe, maybe we could use
some more flags.

106
00:11:06,838 --> 00:11:08,744
- Is that all right?
- Uh--

107
00:11:08,744 --> 00:11:11,127
- Up a bit, I would say, wouldn't you say so?
- Up!

108
00:11:11,127 --> 00:11:14,463
No, no, no, down.

109
00:11:14,463 --> 00:11:17,203
Oh, what a beautiful cake. Here.

110
00:11:20,738 --> 00:11:22,565
You've earned a drink.

111
00:11:25,504 --> 00:11:27,966
You have a beautiful cake.

112
00:11:27,966 --> 00:11:29,873
Hey!

113
00:11:29,873 --> 00:11:31,978
I haven't forgotten about you.

114
00:11:31,978 --> 00:11:33,884
I have one for you too.

115
00:11:58,905 --> 00:12:02,162
Go to... fuckin' hell.

116
00:12:04,147 --> 00:12:07,960
I'll give every car
in the town a flat tire.

117
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,939
- Every goddamn one.
- Oh, Daddy.

118
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:12,726
I'll do it!

119
00:12:14,553 --> 00:12:18,366
Yeah, I fuckin' mean
what I say, girl.

120
00:12:18,366 --> 00:12:20,232
Shh. Yes. Come on.

121
00:12:20,232 --> 00:12:23,886
- All around... like a sea.
- Oh, my God.

122
00:12:23,886 --> 00:12:26,547
Ocean of flat tires.

123
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:29,565
- Fuckin'... bitch.
- No!

124
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:32,544
All bitches.

125
00:12:34,927 --> 00:12:36,833
- I hate 'em.
- Daddy.

126
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:40,249
- Daddy! Daddy, no, it's me!
- Fuckin' bitches!

127
00:12:40,249 --> 00:12:44,062
Give 'em all flat tires.

128
00:13:13,848 --> 00:13:17,462
"You're just too good
to be true"

129
00:13:17,462 --> 00:13:21,871
That's great.
Now I'm gonna smoke your ass.

130
00:13:21,871 --> 00:13:24,730
"Like heaven to touch"

131
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:27,868
"I wanna hold you so much"

132
00:13:27,868 --> 00:13:32,713
"At long last
love has arrived"

133
00:13:32,713 --> 00:13:35,096
"And I thank God I'm alive"

134
00:13:35,096 --> 00:13:38,234
- "You're just too good to be true"
- It's my shot, right?

135
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,895
- "Can't take my eyes"
- Come on, John.

136
00:13:40,895 --> 00:13:42,801
- "Off of you"
- Wipe off the tables.

137
00:13:42,801 --> 00:13:46,614
This is it.
This is really it.

138
00:13:46,733 --> 00:13:49,751
I mean,

139
00:13:49,751 --> 00:13:51,658
here I go.

140
00:13:58,052 --> 00:14:01,666
There's no sense
in gettin' too relaxed, buddy.

141
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:04,247
- "Let me know that it's real"
- Come on.

142
00:14:04,247 --> 00:14:07,584
"You're just too good
to be true"

143
00:14:07,584 --> 00:14:10,523
"Can't take my eyes
off of you"

144
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:15,487
"Ba-da, da-da
Da-da, ba-ba-ba"

145
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:19,101
"Ba-da, ba-da
Ba-ba, da-da-da"

146
00:14:19,101 --> 00:14:22,715
"Ba-da, da-da
Da-da, ba-ba-ba"

147
00:14:22,715 --> 00:14:26,528
"Ba-da, ba-da, da"

148
00:14:26,607 --> 00:14:29,546
"I love you, baby"

149
00:14:29,546 --> 00:14:31,373
"And if it's quite
all right"

150
00:14:31,373 --> 00:14:34,987
"I need you, baby
to warm the lonely night"

151
00:14:34,987 --> 00:14:37,370
"I love you, baby"

152
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:41,183
"Trust in me when I say"

153
00:14:41,262 --> 00:14:44,122
"Oh, pretty baby"

154
00:14:44,122 --> 00:14:47,379
"Don't bring me down, I pray
Oh, pretty baby"

155
00:14:47,379 --> 00:14:49,285
"Now that I've found you
Stay"

156
00:14:49,285 --> 00:14:54,885
"And let me love you, baby
Let me love you"

157
00:14:54,885 --> 00:14:57,546
- You faggot.
- "You're just too good"

158
00:14:57,546 --> 00:15:00,405
- "To be true"
- Bums!

159
00:15:00,405 --> 00:15:03,186
"Can't take my eyes
off of you"

160
00:15:03,186 --> 00:15:05,092
"You--"

161
00:15:05,092 --> 00:15:07,078
Hey!

162
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:10,493
- "I wanna hold you so much"
- Jesus.

163
00:15:17,086 --> 00:15:18,992
Jesus Christ!

164
00:15:18,992 --> 00:15:21,177
To do this to your own mother...

165
00:15:21,177 --> 00:15:25,744
who prays for you all her life.

166
00:15:25,744 --> 00:15:28,127
Is your heart so cruel,
so unfeeling?

167
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:31,542
You marry this girl.
You leave her with me.

168
00:15:31,542 --> 00:15:34,203
And you go with these bums
to the Vietnam!

169
00:15:34,203 --> 00:15:36,308
- Ow. Ow.
- Bullshit.

170
00:15:36,308 --> 00:15:38,413
"And if it's quite all right"

171
00:15:38,413 --> 00:15:41,471
One flight!
It's one flight upstairs!

172
00:15:41,471 --> 00:15:45,244
When I come home-- One flight.

173
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:47,071
I love Angela.

174
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:50,606
And she loves me.

175
00:15:53,823 --> 00:15:56,404
Wear a scarf today!

176
00:15:56,404 --> 00:15:59,741
You don't wear a scarf
with a tuxedo.

177
00:15:59,741 --> 00:16:03,553
I'm not gonna wear
a scarf with a tuxedo.

178
00:16:52,483 --> 00:16:55,343
- You tryin' to look like a prince?
- What do you mean "trying"?

179
00:16:56,971 --> 00:16:58,877
You should've done that
a long time ago.

180
00:16:58,877 --> 00:17:01,618
- That way, it would've set.
- I know.

181
00:17:01,618 --> 00:17:04,755
- Then why didn't you do it?
- 'Cause I forgot.

182
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:11,348
Oh, man.

183
00:17:11,348 --> 00:17:14,088
Steven's gettin' married
in a couple of hours.

184
00:17:14,088 --> 00:17:17,266
We're talkin' about huntin'
the last time before the army.

185
00:17:17,266 --> 00:17:21,714
The whole thing, it's crazy.

186
00:17:21,714 --> 00:17:24,216
I'll tell ya one thing.

187
00:17:24,216 --> 00:17:26,877
If I found out my life
had to end up in the mountains,

188
00:17:26,877 --> 00:17:28,783
I'd be all right.

189
00:17:28,783 --> 00:17:31,523
But it has to be
in your mind.

190
00:17:31,523 --> 00:17:33,430
What?

191
00:17:34,383 --> 00:17:36,289
One shot?

192
00:17:37,997 --> 00:17:40,380
Two is pussy.

193
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,564
I don't think about one shot
that much anymore, Mike.

194
00:17:42,564 --> 00:17:45,146
You have to think about one shot.
One shot is what it's all about.

195
00:17:45,146 --> 00:17:47,052
A deer has to be taken
with one shot.

196
00:17:47,052 --> 00:17:49,912
I try to tell people that.
They don't listen.

197
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,941
- You really think about Vietnam?
- Yeah.

198
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,151
I don't know. I guess.

199
00:18:01,151 --> 00:18:04,567
I'm thinkin' about the deer.
Going to Nam.

200
00:18:04,567 --> 00:18:07,903
I like the trees, you know?

201
00:18:07,903 --> 00:18:11,716
I like the way the trees are in the mountains,
all the different--

202
00:18:14,853 --> 00:18:16,760
The way the trees are.

203
00:18:19,063 --> 00:18:21,247
I sound like
some asshole, right?

204
00:18:22,876 --> 00:18:26,291
I'll tell you, Nick, you're the only guy
I go huntin' with, you know?

205
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:29,349
I like a guy with quick moves and speed.
I ain't gonna hunt with no assholes.

206
00:18:29,349 --> 00:18:31,534
- Well, who's an asshole?
- Who's an asshole?

207
00:18:31,534 --> 00:18:33,599
Who do you think's
an asshole?

208
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:36,459
They're all a bunch of assholes.

209
00:18:36,459 --> 00:18:40,271
I mean, I love 'em. They're great guys,
but without you, I'd hunt alone.

210
00:18:40,549 --> 00:18:44,005
- Seriously, that's what I'd do.
- Well, you're a fuckin' nut.

211
00:18:44,005 --> 00:18:47,817
You know that, Mike.
You're a maniac, control freak.

212
00:18:47,897 --> 00:18:49,724
I just don't like
no surprises.

213
00:18:53,139 --> 00:18:56,197
- Damn thing won't open.
- Well, give it a kick.

214
00:18:56,197 --> 00:18:58,262
Hey, man, hey, hey,
not like that. Not--

215
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,844
Here, here, here.

216
00:19:00,844 --> 00:19:02,949
- See that?
- Fuckin' A.

217
00:19:05,133 --> 00:19:07,715
Unreal.

218
00:19:07,715 --> 00:19:12,084
Axel, now I know why you're not
still kicking for the Steelers.

219
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:15,221
You know, I love Mike's car.

220
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:17,247
Yeah, some cars, they just sit.

221
00:19:17,247 --> 00:19:20,742
You never know with a car like this
where the hell it's gonna take you.

222
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:24,197
Yeah.
It makes me feel safe.

223
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,797
Oh, what is he doing?

224
00:19:29,797 --> 00:19:33,609
Axel's humping
Mike's Coupe de Ville.

225
00:19:35,913 --> 00:19:39,606
- Axel, get out of there.
- Let's get the carnations.

226
00:19:39,606 --> 00:19:42,744
Get up. Get up.
What are you doing?

227
00:19:42,744 --> 00:19:46,160
Come on. Sit up.
Oh, God, you're impossible.

228
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,496
- Here, put this on, you have to have that on.
- Crummy tuxedo.

229
00:19:49,496 --> 00:19:52,355
Tuxedo's been stuck a million times.

230
00:19:52,355 --> 00:19:55,612
- Where'd you get this thing?
It's not funny.

231
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:58,829
- I'm beautiful, right? I'm beautiful.
- No, you're not.

232
00:19:58,829 --> 00:20:00,656
- All set.
- Thanks, Amy.

233
00:20:08,361 --> 00:20:11,141
You can't even
sit up, Axel. Oh!

234
00:20:11,141 --> 00:20:14,636
- Axel, come on. Sit up.
- Beautiful.

235
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,738
Linda, what's the matter?
I was gonna pick you up.

236
00:20:22,738 --> 00:20:24,723
Hi.

237
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:27,027
- What's the matter?
- He hit me.

238
00:20:29,013 --> 00:20:33,699
Hey, come here, come here.
I wanna ask you something.

239
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,606
Hey, wait a minute,
goddamn it.

240
00:20:35,606 --> 00:20:37,988
You don't walk away from me.
What is that on your face?

241
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:42,159
Nicky, you and Michael,
you're goin' away in a couple of days.

242
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,296
I was just wonderin'
if I could use this place to stay.

243
00:20:45,296 --> 00:20:49,109
- Oh, sure.
- I'd wanna pay you both.

244
00:20:49,109 --> 00:20:51,889
- And I was thinking--
- What are you talkin' about?

245
00:20:56,178 --> 00:20:58,561
I would wanna
pay you, Nick.

246
00:20:58,561 --> 00:21:02,731
Hey, Kochatka,
it's me you're talking to.

247
00:21:02,731 --> 00:21:07,219
You know, how long
have you known me for?

248
00:21:07,219 --> 00:21:09,324
What?

249
00:21:09,324 --> 00:21:11,230
I don't know.

250
00:23:01,084 --> 00:23:04,063
Have you, Steven,
a free will and a firm intention...

251
00:23:04,063 --> 00:23:06,128
to take unto yourself
as wife this woman, Angela,

252
00:23:06,128 --> 00:23:07,875
whom you see before you?

253
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:08,987
I do.

254
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:14,230
- You have not promised yourself to any other bride?
- I have not.

255
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:16,732
Have you, Angela,
a free will and a firm intention...

256
00:23:16,732 --> 00:23:19,393
to take unto yourself
as husband this man, Steven,

257
00:23:19,393 --> 00:23:21,180
whom you see before you?

258
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,530
I have.

259
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:26,701
- You have not promised yourself to any other man?
- I have not.

260
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,698
Blessed is the kingdom
of the Father and of the Son...

261
00:23:32,698 --> 00:23:34,604
and of the Holy Spirit,

262
00:23:34,604 --> 00:23:39,370
now and ever
and unto ages of ages.

263
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:45,009
"Amen"

264
00:25:21,757 --> 00:25:26,682
"Entreat, entreat
the Lord"

265
00:25:26,682 --> 00:25:30,971
"Entreat, entreat the Lord"

266
00:25:30,971 --> 00:25:35,459
"And He will have mercy"

267
00:25:35,459 --> 00:25:41,813
"On our souls"

268
00:29:29,424 --> 00:29:32,283
Hey, hey, hey!

269
00:29:51,426 --> 00:29:53,332
Oh, hey,
what's going on?

270
00:29:53,332 --> 00:29:56,073
For a buck,
you get a shooter, a cigar...

271
00:29:56,073 --> 00:29:59,409
and a dance
with the beautiful bride.

272
00:29:59,409 --> 00:30:01,236
Fuckin' A.

273
00:30:02,268 --> 00:30:04,056
And you're on your way.

274
00:30:13,707 --> 00:30:16,924
Do it. Come on. Do it.

275
00:30:43,215 --> 00:30:45,876
Whoo!

276
00:31:14,074 --> 00:31:15,862
May I have your attention,
please, ladies and gentlemen?

277
00:31:15,862 --> 00:31:19,595
Quiet, please, please.

278
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:27,697
That's really wonderful. Thank you.
May I have your attention, please?

279
00:31:27,697 --> 00:31:29,683
I have a very,
very important announcement.

Whoever owns a white Chevy lmpala,

282

339
00:34:11,564 --> 00:34:15,370
"Trust in me when I say"

340
00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:18,106
"Oh, pretty baby"

341
00:34:18,106 --> 00:34:21,833
"Don't bring me down, I pray
Oh, pretty baby"

342
00:34:21,833 --> 00:34:23,735
"Now that I've found you
Stay"

343
00:34:23,735 --> 00:34:26,590
"And let me love you, baby"

344
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:30,277
"Let me love you"

345
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:34,003
"You're just too good
to be true"

346
00:34:34,003 --> 00:34:37,413
"Can't take my eyes
off of you"

347
00:34:37,413 --> 00:34:40,743
"You feel like heaven
to touch"

348
00:34:40,743 --> 00:34:44,549
"I want to hold you so much"

349
00:34:44,746 --> 00:34:48,076
"At long last
love has arrived"

350
00:34:48,076 --> 00:34:51,288
I'm not the greatest dancer
in the world.

351
00:34:52,359 --> 00:34:54,221
- You're okay.
- I am not.

352
00:34:54,221 --> 00:34:57,671
No, you're very fancy.

353
00:34:59,256 --> 00:35:02,111
You want a beer
or something like that?

354
00:35:02,111 --> 00:35:05,361
- You want a beer or something?
- Okay. Sure.

355
00:35:05,361 --> 00:35:08,137
- What kind of beer would you like?
- What? I don't know.

356
00:35:08,137 --> 00:35:11,427
- What kind of beer would you like?
- I don't care. Any kind.

357
00:35:11,427 --> 00:35:13,806
- I'll get you a Rolling Rock.
- Okay.

358
00:35:13,806 --> 00:35:17,057
- That's a good beer, it's the best around.
- Huh? Yeah, okay.

359
00:35:17,057 --> 00:35:19,316
- Rolling Rock?
- Yeah.

360
00:35:19,316 --> 00:35:21,220
Be right back.

361
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:24,668
"Oh, pretty baby
Don't bring me down, I pray"

362
00:35:24,668 --> 00:35:28,078
"I need you, baby
to warm the lonely night"

363
00:35:28,078 --> 00:35:31,883
"I love you, baby
Trust in me when I say"

364
00:35:33,985 --> 00:35:35,887
You wanna come?
I'll get you--

365
00:35:35,887 --> 00:35:38,623
"Oh, pretty baby
Don't bring me down, I pray"

366
00:35:38,623 --> 00:35:41,953
"Oh, pretty baby
Now that I've found you, stay"

367
00:35:41,953 --> 00:35:45,561
"And let me love you, baby"

368
00:35:45,561 --> 00:35:47,463
"Let me love you"

369
00:35:47,463 --> 00:35:49,367
Hey, Jerry.

370
00:35:49,367 --> 00:35:51,943
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

371
00:35:51,943 --> 00:35:54,798
Jerry, give us two
Rolling Rocks...

372
00:35:54,798 --> 00:35:57,533
and give me a Kessler
on the side.

373
00:35:57,533 --> 00:35:59,912
It's okay.
It's a wedding, you know.

374
00:35:59,912 --> 00:36:03,718
You're supposed to let go
and have fun and all that.

375
00:36:05,145 --> 00:36:07,048
You really like Nick a lot, huh?

376
00:36:07,048 --> 00:36:08,951
Anybody else for a shooter?

377
00:36:09,903 --> 00:36:11,805
Yeah.

378
00:36:33,181 --> 00:36:36,314
Axel!

379
00:36:36,314 --> 00:36:39,049
Put me down!
What are you doing?

380
00:36:39,049 --> 00:36:41,349
Axel! Help!

381
00:36:52,449 --> 00:36:56,255
Axel, no!
Axel, put me down!

382
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:58,356
- What are you doing? Oh, Axel.
- I'm gonna kiss you.

383
00:36:58,356 --> 00:37:02,637
Stop! Stop!
I'm gonna stab you.

384
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,817
- You wanna fuck or fight?
- Axel!

385
00:37:09,297 --> 00:37:13,579
I think I might like to dance
with the lady, if you don't mind.

386
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,618
Have you known him long?

387
00:37:34,114 --> 00:37:36,851
This is the most fun
I've had in months.

388
00:37:47,118 --> 00:37:50,647
Do you know what that son of a bitch
is doing?

389
00:37:53,778 --> 00:37:56,157
He's got his hand
on her ass!

390
00:37:56,157 --> 00:37:59,963
It's only--
It's only--

391
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,649
- It's only a wedding.
- What do you mean, "It's only a wedding"?

392
00:38:03,649 --> 00:38:06,979
The guy-- Look, he did it again!
He just did it!

393
00:38:06,979 --> 00:38:11,182
- Come on. I gotta go get my gun out of my coat.
- Go get your gun. Go get it.

394
00:38:34,532 --> 00:38:36,554
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

395
00:38:36,554 --> 00:38:39,290
Time out. Time out!

396
00:38:56,694 --> 00:38:58,676
You hurt me, you--

397
00:38:58,676 --> 00:39:00,975
You punched me right there.
It hurts.

398
00:39:05,058 --> 00:39:06,882
Is that better?

399
00:39:25,991 --> 00:39:27,893
I'm gonna kick
on his fuckin' ass.

400
00:39:29,479 --> 00:39:31,858
- Hey, Stan is crazy.
- Why? What happened?

401
00:39:31,858 --> 00:39:33,761
- That Stan is crazy.
- What happened?

402
00:39:33,761 --> 00:39:35,663
It's a Green Beret!

403
00:39:35,663 --> 00:39:39,469
- Hey! Whoo!
- No kidding.

404
00:39:39,469 --> 00:39:41,927
Jerry!
Jerry, give the man a drink.

405
00:39:41,927 --> 00:39:45,535
- Hey!
- Give him a drink!

406
00:39:45,535 --> 00:39:48,033
- Sir! Sir!
- Sir!

407
00:39:48,033 --> 00:39:49,539
Na zdorovije.

408
00:39:49,539 --> 00:39:51,640
- Na zdorovije.
- Na zdorovije.

409
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:59,133
Don't cause any kind
of problem, huh?

410
00:39:59,133 --> 00:40:02,740
Nah, I wanna talk to the man. I wanna talk to the man.
We're goin' over there.

411
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,763
Sir, Mike Vronsky.

412
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:12,374
- Nick. This is the groom, Steve.
- I'm the best man.

413
00:40:14,158 --> 00:40:16,061
We're goin' airborne, sir.
What's it like?

414
00:40:16,061 --> 00:40:17,964
- I hope they send us where the bullets are flyin'.
- That's right.

415
00:40:17,964 --> 00:40:21,294
- Fighting's the worst, huh?
- That's right.

416
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:23,118
Fuck it.

417
00:40:24,149 --> 00:40:26,526
- Fuck it? What did he say?
- Fuck it.

418
00:40:26,526 --> 00:40:29,381
Fuck it.
That's what I thought.

419
00:40:29,381 --> 00:40:32,593
W-- Well, what's it like
over there?

420
00:40:32,593 --> 00:40:35,844
Can you tell us anything?

421
00:40:35,844 --> 00:40:37,627
Fuck it.

422
00:40:38,777 --> 00:40:41,631
Okay, fuck it.

423
00:40:41,631 --> 00:40:43,535
Fuck him.

424
00:40:48,291 --> 00:40:50,274
Fuck it. Hey!

425
00:40:50,274 --> 00:40:52,652
Michael, hey.

426
00:40:52,652 --> 00:40:54,952
- Hey.
- Fuck who?

427
00:40:56,656 --> 00:40:58,560
Fuck who?

428
00:40:59,987 --> 00:41:01,969
- Who the hell is he?
- Who the fuck knows?

429
00:41:01,969 --> 00:41:04,070
He looks like a fuckin' hillbilly.

430
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:06,925
Give him another drink, Jerry.
Just the same.

431
00:41:06,925 --> 00:41:09,581
Hey! Fuck it!

432
00:41:09,581 --> 00:41:11,682
Fuck you.

433
00:41:13,743 --> 00:41:16,122
Hey! Hey!

434
00:41:27,341 --> 00:41:29,838
Hey! Hey!

435
00:41:39,433 --> 00:41:41,812
Steven.

436
00:41:41,812 --> 00:41:43,595
Hey! Hey!

437
00:41:47,877 --> 00:41:50,177
Hey! Hey!

438
00:41:58,739 --> 00:42:00,523
Oh!

439
00:42:07,936 --> 00:42:11,069
Hey! Hey!

440
00:42:19,711 --> 00:42:21,733
Hey! Hey!

441
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:39,969
I got it!

442
00:42:46,075 --> 00:42:47,858
Will you marry me?

443
00:42:49,682 --> 00:42:51,585
Yeah.

444
00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:54,440
You would?

445
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,302
Mm-hmm.

446
00:42:56,302 --> 00:43:00,108
What I mean is
if we get back from--

447
00:43:00,108 --> 00:43:02,487
I mean, when we get back.

448
00:43:02,487 --> 00:43:04,390
I don't know
what the hell I mean.

449
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:07,918
I think what goes through your mind
comes out your mouth.

450
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,821
Angela and Steven,

451
00:43:12,873 --> 00:43:14,777
if you don't spill a drop,

452
00:43:14,777 --> 00:43:17,631
it's good luck
for the rest of your life.

453
00:45:30,948 --> 00:45:34,298
- Hey!
- Hey, hey!

454
00:45:34,298 --> 00:45:37,647
Whoo!

455
00:45:37,647 --> 00:45:40,159
Don't worry what Stan says.
Just forget that.

456
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:42,712
- He's got a big fucking mouth.
- Right.

457
00:45:42,712 --> 00:45:44,625
- Huh?
- That's enough.

458
00:45:44,625 --> 00:45:46,539
- Hey!
- Come here.

459
00:45:46,539 --> 00:45:49,331
I never really did it
with Angela, Nicky.

460
00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:54,873
Great. That's great.

461
00:45:56,668 --> 00:45:59,060
That's my last one true secret.

462
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:01,731
It's nothing. It's nothing.
Just forget about it.

463
00:46:01,731 --> 00:46:04,523
Angela, Angela!

464
00:46:07,315 --> 00:46:09,188
Oh, Angela.

465
00:46:09,188 --> 00:46:11,104
What am I gonna do
when she has the baby?

466
00:46:11,104 --> 00:46:13,017
- That's Angela's part, right?
- That's right.

467
00:46:13,017 --> 00:46:14,930
- Just hang loose.
- Hang loose?

468
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:16,965
Be happy.

469
00:46:16,965 --> 00:46:19,716
Go on. Get out of here.
We don't wanna see you anymore.

470
00:46:19,716 --> 00:46:21,551
Look at this maniac.

471
00:46:22,986 --> 00:46:25,737
I'll see you Monday
on the train.

472
00:46:25,737 --> 00:46:29,206
- Hey.
- Drive carefully.

473
00:46:29,206 --> 00:46:33,394
- You didn't know that about Angela, huh? Right?
- Oh, that's bullshit.

474
00:46:33,394 --> 00:46:35,706
- Oh, it's bullshit, right? Yeah?
- It's bullshit. Bullshit.

475
00:46:35,706 --> 00:46:37,620
- I happen to know it's true.
- That's bullshit.

476
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:39,534
-I happen to know it's true. All right?
-You're full of bullshit.

477
00:46:39,534 --> 00:46:42,564
- Do you wanna bet? Put your money where your mouth is.
- Yeah. Bullshit.

478
00:46:42,564 --> 00:46:44,599
- Go fuck yourself, Stan.
- Huh? Go fuck yourself.

479
00:46:44,599 --> 00:46:48,387
- Fuck you.
- Ah, grow up.

480
00:46:48,387 --> 00:46:52,135
Hey! Hey! All right!

481
00:47:03,819 --> 00:47:07,129
Michael, Michael, what are you doing?

482
00:47:07,129 --> 00:47:10,957
- Mike! Hey, Mike!
- Michael!

483
00:47:11,155 --> 00:47:14,984
Michael, what the hell are you doing?

484
00:47:15,263 --> 00:47:18,334
- Michael!
- Hey!

485
00:47:18,334 --> 00:47:21,484
Michael, what the hell
are you doing? Michael!

486
00:47:21,484 --> 00:47:24,833
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Fuck it!

487
00:47:24,833 --> 00:47:29,419
Michael, come back here!
What the hell is he doing?

488
00:47:29,419 --> 00:47:31,533
Michael, what the hell are you doing?

489
00:47:31,533 --> 00:47:33,446
- Hey, Mike!
- Michael, come back here!

490
00:47:33,446 --> 00:47:35,361
Come here, Michael!

491
00:47:35,361 --> 00:47:37,754
You know we love you!
Get back here!

492
00:47:37,754 --> 00:47:42,339
Hey, Mike!
I gotta talk to you!

493
00:47:50,752 --> 00:47:52,826
Mike!

494
00:47:59,525 --> 00:48:01,360
Hey!

495
00:48:25,046 --> 00:48:26,960
Shit!

496
00:48:29,273 --> 00:48:31,746
I must be out of
my fuckin' mind.

497
00:48:31,746 --> 00:48:34,616
I must be out of my mind.

498
00:48:38,724 --> 00:48:41,514
I don't know.
Everything's going so fast.

499
00:48:41,514 --> 00:48:44,386
Man, oh, man.

500
00:48:44,386 --> 00:48:46,300
Hey, Nick.

501
00:48:48,213 --> 00:48:50,486
Think we'll ever come back?

502
00:48:50,486 --> 00:48:52,401
- From Nam?
- Yeah.

503
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:57,943
You know something?

504
00:48:57,943 --> 00:49:03,008
The whole thing,
it's right here.

505
00:49:03,008 --> 00:49:04,921
I love this fuckin' place.

506
00:49:04,921 --> 00:49:06,956
- You're crazy, man.
- I know that sounds crazy.

507
00:49:06,956 --> 00:49:10,783
If anything happens, Mike,
don't leave me over there.

508
00:49:10,943 --> 00:49:13,614
You got-- You gotta--
Just don't leave me.

509
00:49:13,614 --> 00:49:17,443
- You gotta promise me that, Mike.
- Hey.

510
00:49:17,443 --> 00:49:19,835
No, man, you got--
you gotta--

511
00:49:19,835 --> 00:49:23,104
You gotta promise definitely.

512
00:49:23,104 --> 00:49:25,218
- Hey, Nicky.
- Huh?

513
00:49:25,218 --> 00:49:28,728
- You got it, pal.
- Promise?

514
00:50:08,683 --> 00:50:11,555
"Shout Geronimo, Geronimo"

515
00:50:11,555 --> 00:50:14,624
"It's a silk and check your canopy
and take a look around"

516
00:50:14,624 --> 00:50:17,695
"The air is filled with troopers
set for battle on the ground"

517
00:50:17,695 --> 00:50:20,845
"'Til we join the stick of angels
Kill the lengthy Amazon"

518
00:50:20,845 --> 00:50:24,275
- "Shout Geronimo, Geronimo"
- It's the Screaming Eagles Airborne song.

519
00:50:24,275 --> 00:50:27,266
"It's a gory road to glory, But we're ready
Here we go"

520
00:50:27,266 --> 00:50:29,059
- "Shout Geronimo"
- Screaming assholes.

521
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:32,130
- "Geronimo, look out below"
- Fuckin' A.

522
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:35,360
- "Look out below"
- "Let me be free"

523
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:38,710
-"Let me be free"
-I don't remember the rest of the words.

524
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:40,624
"So let me be free"

525
00:50:40,624 --> 00:50:45,130
- "You'll always be happy with me"
- Chickenshit, get scared.

526
00:50:59,566 --> 00:51:01,479
Oh, boy.

527
00:51:01,479 --> 00:51:03,273
Fuckin' cold.

528
00:51:05,666 --> 00:51:08,059
Thirty-six beers.

529
00:51:08,059 --> 00:51:11,248
- Whoo! What?
- Come on.

530
00:51:11,248 --> 00:51:13,321
All right,
I'll go on, already.

531
00:51:13,321 --> 00:51:15,156
Wait, wait.

532
00:51:19,144 --> 00:51:23,929
You ever piss and take a drink of beer
at the same time?

533
00:51:27,398 --> 00:51:29,312
Whoa.

534
00:51:31,585 --> 00:51:34,256
Ah, I just barely
got a chance to shake it off.

535
00:51:34,256 --> 00:51:36,091
Wait! Come on!
Oh, fuck!

536
00:51:39,521 --> 00:51:41,355
Bastards!

537
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:44,585
Sons of bitches!

538
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:21,510
- You guys goin' my way?
- Come on.

539
00:52:27,332 --> 00:52:29,166
Fuck!

540
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:36,145
That's not funny!

541
00:52:52,853 --> 00:52:54,766
No fuckin' around now.

542
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:59,552
Come on. Stick around.
Don't fuck around.

543
00:53:00,987 --> 00:53:02,901
All right?
No fuckin' around.

544
00:53:29,937 --> 00:53:32,808
- Lemme out! Lemme out!
- Out, out. Get out.

545
00:53:37,233 --> 00:53:39,149
This is not it.
Definitely.

546
00:53:39,149 --> 00:53:41,062
- They changed it.
- No kidding.

547
00:53:41,062 --> 00:53:42,936
Somehow they changed it.

548
00:53:42,936 --> 00:53:47,363
- Like this happens every goddamn year.
- You're full of shit, Stanley.

549
00:53:47,363 --> 00:53:50,034
- Who did you say was full of shit?
- You're full of shit.

550
00:53:50,034 --> 00:53:53,584
- You're always full of shit.
- I'm starvin'.

551
00:53:53,584 --> 00:53:56,335
Eat that.

552
00:53:56,335 --> 00:53:58,647
Nick, how come
I never see you eatin'?

553
00:53:58,647 --> 00:54:01,199
I like to starve myself.
Keeps the fear up.

554
00:54:01,199 --> 00:54:05,028
- It ain't natural. Come on, John.
- Hey! That's mine.

555
00:54:05,028 --> 00:54:07,699
- You really want it that bad?
- You're goddamn right.

556
00:54:07,699 --> 00:54:12,006
- Hey, give me a Twinkie, Mike.
- What are you guys, a bunch of cripples?

557
00:54:19,104 --> 00:54:21,975
- That's mustard!
- What?

558
00:54:21,975 --> 00:54:25,684
He put mustard
on his Twink--

559
00:54:25,684 --> 00:54:28,076
You're talkin' like
a goddamn traffic cop.

560
00:54:28,076 --> 00:54:31,147
- Oh, fuck--
- Come on. Give me a beer, Mike.

561
00:54:31,147 --> 00:54:34,296
- Come on. Come on.
- I can't believe you guys.

562
00:54:34,296 --> 00:54:36,769
- What the hell am I doing with you?
- This is not it.

563
00:54:36,769 --> 00:54:39,440
They changed it.
Somehow they changed it.

564
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:43,268
- You couldn't find your own ass with two hands.
- Fuckin' A.

565
00:54:43,468 --> 00:54:47,974
Hey, you know, we forgot
to toast Steven and Angela.

566
00:54:47,974 --> 00:54:50,088
Steven and Angela!

567
00:54:50,088 --> 00:54:54,393
Na zdorovije!

568
00:54:56,387 --> 00:55:00,216
What?

569
00:55:00,296 --> 00:55:03,645
Don't make me laugh
when I have things in my mouth.

570
00:55:03,645 --> 00:55:06,117
I can't take you guys anyplace.
What the hell you doin'?

571
00:55:06,117 --> 00:55:08,430
Get your hands
off the fuckin' bread.

572
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:10,822
You can dress 'em up,
but you can't take 'em anywhere.

573
00:55:10,822 --> 00:55:12,737
Oh, come on.
Come on!

574
00:55:12,737 --> 00:55:15,408
What the fuck you doin'?
That was mine, you assholes.

575
00:55:20,393 --> 00:55:23,144
Fuckin' assholes.
I can't fuckin'--

576
00:55:23,144 --> 00:55:26,493
- Fuckin' A!
- What the fuck?

577
00:55:26,493 --> 00:55:29,285
You know, Axel, you got
a terrific vocabulary.

578
00:55:29,285 --> 00:55:31,199
- Fuckin' A.
- Hey, watch the gear.

579
00:55:31,199 --> 00:55:34,629
Watch the rifle.
Axel, gimme my bag.

580
00:55:37,221 --> 00:55:39,015
It's gettin' cold, huh?

581
00:55:40,371 --> 00:55:43,242
Hey, Mike, you got
any extra thermal socks?

582
00:55:49,543 --> 00:55:52,692
Hey, Mike, you got
any extra thermal socks?

583
00:55:53,848 --> 00:55:55,643
Never mind. I got 'em.

584
00:55:56,999 --> 00:55:58,913
Where the hell's my boots?

585
00:56:01,784 --> 00:56:04,176
Anybody see my boots?

586
00:56:04,176 --> 00:56:07,406
Somebody took my boots.
I bought 'em special.

587
00:56:09,121 --> 00:56:12,950
All right. All right, you guys.
Whoever took my boots, I want 'em back.

588
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:16,498
I got a boot for you, Stan,
right up your ass.

589
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:18,332
Hey, Mike.

590
00:56:20,525 --> 00:56:23,397
Hey, Mike, lemme borrow
your spares, huh?

591
00:56:23,397 --> 00:56:26,268
- Your extra pair?
- No, Stan.

592
00:56:26,268 --> 00:56:28,182
No?

593
00:56:29,975 --> 00:56:33,525
- What do you mean, "No"?
- Just what I said. No. No means no.

594
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:38,590
Some fuckin' friend.
You're some fuckin' friend, you know that?

595
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:41,540
Every time you come here,
you got your head up your ass.

596
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:44,889
Maybe he likes the view from up there.

597
00:56:48,718 --> 00:56:51,789
Every time he comes up,
he's got no knife, no jacket.

598
00:56:51,789 --> 00:56:54,062
He's got no pants, no boots.

599
00:56:54,062 --> 00:56:57,411
All he's got is that stupid gun
he carries like John Wayne.

600
00:56:57,411 --> 00:56:59,324
That ain't gonna help ya.

601
00:56:59,324 --> 00:57:01,997
Oh, what the hell, Mike.
Give him the boots.

602
00:57:01,997 --> 00:57:05,824
No, I ain't givin' him no boots.
No more. That's it.

603
00:57:05,824 --> 00:57:09,653
You're a fuckin' bastard,
you know that? Huh?

604
00:57:09,733 --> 00:57:11,646
Stanley, see this?
This is this.

605
00:57:11,646 --> 00:57:14,717
This ain't somethin' else.
This is this.

606
00:57:14,717 --> 00:57:17,508
From now on, you're on your own.

607
00:57:21,017 --> 00:57:22,932
I fixed you up a million times.

608
00:57:22,932 --> 00:57:25,802
I fixed him up a million times.

609
00:57:25,802 --> 00:57:28,116
I don't know how many times
I must've fixed him up with girls.

610
00:57:28,116 --> 00:57:30,706
And nothin' ever happened. Zero.

611
00:57:30,706 --> 00:57:33,858
You know your trouble, Mike?
Nobody ever knows what you're talkin' about.

612
00:57:33,858 --> 00:57:37,685
"This is this." What the hell's
that supposed to mean? "This is this."

613
00:57:37,685 --> 00:57:40,557
Is that faggot-soundin' bullshit,
or is that faggot-soundin'--

614
00:57:40,557 --> 00:57:43,507
Shut up, Stan, will ya?
Hey, man, you're outta line.

615
00:57:43,507 --> 00:57:46,737
Watch out with that gun, Stan.
Watch out with the gun.

616
00:57:46,737 --> 00:57:50,485
Do you know what I think? There's
times I swear I think you're a faggot.

617
00:57:50,485 --> 00:57:52,400
Hey, come on, you guys.

618
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,470
Last week he could've had that new
redheaded waitress at the Bowladrome.

619
00:57:55,470 --> 00:57:57,663
He could've had it,
but look what he did.

620
00:57:57,663 --> 00:58:00,055
Nothin', that's what.

621
00:58:00,046 --> 00:58:03,065
Shut up, Stan.
Just shut up!

622
00:58:03,065 --> 00:58:07,354
Just shut up. Take-- Take Michael's
goddamn boots and shut up.

623
00:58:07,354 --> 00:58:10,213
Otherwise, I'm goin' home.
I'm goin' home right now.

624
00:58:10,213 --> 00:58:14,304
Get off my stuff.
What the hell're you doin'?

625
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:18,593
Hey, Stosh.

626
00:58:18,593 --> 00:58:20,420
I said, "No."

627
00:58:25,067 --> 00:58:27,728
What? Are you gonna
shoot me? Huh?

628
00:58:28,681 --> 00:58:30,786
Here.

629
00:58:48,976 --> 00:58:50,882
What's the matter with you?

630
00:58:50,882 --> 00:58:53,464
Stan.

631
01:01:57,705 --> 01:02:00,564
Watch it, Mike! Pow! Whack!

632
01:01:54,807 --> 01:01:58,222
Hey! Hey, Angela!

633
01:02:01,002 --> 01:02:04,696
Bums! Go home!
Go home!

634
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:18,993
"Drop-kick me, Jesus"

635
01:02:18,993 --> 01:02:21,257
"Through the goalposts of life"

636
01:02:21,257 --> 01:02:24,990
"End over end
Neither left nor to right"

637
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:28,803
"Straight through the heart
of the righteous uprights"

638
01:02:29,002 --> 01:02:38,414
"Drop-kick me, Jesus,
through the goalposts of life"

639
01:02:38,414 --> 01:02:42,227
"End over end
Neither left nor to right"

640
01:02:42,505 --> 01:02:46,318
"Straight through the heart
of the righteous uprights"

641
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:48,701
"Drop-kick me, Jesus"

642
01:02:48,701 --> 01:02:51,441
"Through the goalposts of life"

643
01:02:51,441 --> 01:02:53,347
"Drop-kick me, Jesus"

644
01:02:53,347 --> 01:02:55,373
"Through the goalposts of life"

645
01:02:55,373 --> 01:03:01,171
"End over end, end over end
Neither left nor to right"

646
01:03:01,171 --> 01:03:05,540
"Straight through the heart
of the righteous uprights"

647
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:07,566
"Drop-kick me, Jesus"

648
01:03:07,566 --> 01:03:11,259
"Through the goalposts of life"

649
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:49,219
Un-fuckin'-believable.

650
01:07:34,375 --> 01:07:36,560
Oh, Christ.
I don't believe it.

651
01:07:37,592 --> 01:07:39,499
- Mike?
- Mike!

652
01:07:39,499 --> 01:07:42,080
Jesus Christ!
Hey!

653
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:44,344
lncoming!

654
01:09:29,695 --> 01:09:32,634
Steven, take it easy.
Stevie!

655
01:09:32,634 --> 01:09:35,375
Stevie, calm down!

656
01:09:43,397 --> 01:09:45,304
Think of something else.

657
01:09:45,304 --> 01:09:47,210
Tell yourself to think
of something else.

658
01:09:52,333 --> 01:09:55,113
We don't belong here.

659
01:10:11,556 --> 01:10:13,939
Stevie, take it easy.

660
01:10:13,939 --> 01:10:17,116
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

661
01:10:17,116 --> 01:10:20,611
I'm all right.
- It's gonna be okay.

662
01:10:37,093 --> 01:10:38,999
I'm okay.

663
01:10:38,999 --> 01:10:42,693
Okay, just take it easy.

664
01:10:42,693 --> 01:10:46,506
It's okay. It's okay.

665
01:10:46,506 --> 01:10:48,332
Take it easy.
Stevie, take it easy.

666
01:10:52,026 --> 01:10:53,932
Mike?

667
01:11:00,525 --> 01:11:04,139
Come on. Come on. Come on.

668
01:11:04,139 --> 01:11:07,078
I'm okay.

669
01:11:32,337 --> 01:11:36,508
Easy. Okay. Okay.

670
01:11:36,508 --> 01:11:38,970
All right, press hard.
Press hard. Press hard.

671
01:11:38,970 --> 01:11:41,075
I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.

672
01:11:41,075 --> 01:11:44,331
Go ahead. That's it.
That's it.

673
01:11:44,331 --> 01:11:46,714
Mike.

674
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:51,361
Shake it off.

675
01:11:51,361 --> 01:11:53,665
Shake it off. Shake it out.

676
01:11:53,665 --> 01:11:55,650
Think of something else.

677
01:11:55,650 --> 01:11:59,066
Think of home.
Think of home.

678
01:12:40,807 --> 01:12:44,104
- Come on.
- They're gonna have to kill my ass, Mike.

679
01:12:46,129 --> 01:12:48,035
Stevie, you gotta do it.

680
01:12:48,035 --> 01:12:50,577
You don't do it,
they're gonna throw you in the pit.

681
01:12:50,577 --> 01:12:52,484
They throw you in the pit,
you're gonna die.

682
01:12:52,484 --> 01:12:55,661
Go ahead. You gotta do it.
You can do it.

683
01:12:55,661 --> 01:12:58,203
You can do it, Stevie.
You can do it.

684
01:13:03,564 --> 01:13:05,431
Look in my eyes.

685
01:13:05,431 --> 01:13:07,337
Stevie?
Stevie, look at me!

686
01:13:07,337 --> 01:13:09,919
- Mike?
- Do it!

687
01:13:09,919 --> 01:13:13,175
Go ahead.
Show 'em you got balls.

688
01:13:13,175 --> 01:13:15,082
Aw, fuck you.

689
01:13:15,082 --> 01:13:18,894
Go ahead. Shoot me! Go ahead!

690
01:13:20,761 --> 01:13:23,144
Come on.

691
01:13:27,274 --> 01:13:29,181
Go ahead.
Go ahead, Stevie!

692
01:13:29,181 --> 01:13:31,723
Go ahead! Show 'em you got balls!

693
01:13:31,723 --> 01:13:33,828
Go ahead!

694
01:13:46,497 --> 01:13:48,880
Hey, kid. Kid.

695
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:51,938
Look at me, Stevie. You did it.

696
01:13:55,353 --> 01:13:57,260
Stevie.

697
01:13:57,260 --> 01:14:00,119
You showed these bastards.
Showed 'em.

698
01:14:11,835 --> 01:14:14,973
Don't worry, kid.

699
01:14:14,973 --> 01:14:16,760
You did it.

700
01:14:32,567 --> 01:14:37,055
- Michael! Michael!
- Stevie!

701
01:14:43,926 --> 01:14:49,049
Michael!

702
01:14:54,212 --> 01:14:56,674
Stevie!
Stevie, don't worry!

703
01:14:56,674 --> 01:14:59,415
Mike!

704
01:14:59,415 --> 01:15:01,321
Mike! Oh!

705
01:15:01,321 --> 01:15:03,148
Oh, God.

706
01:15:03,148 --> 01:15:05,809
Michael, there's rats in here.

707
01:15:24,873 --> 01:15:26,858
Nicky--

708
01:15:33,411 --> 01:15:38,177
Motherfucker!

709
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:41,315
Nicky, listen.

710
01:15:45,247 --> 01:15:47,788
It's up to us now.
It's me and you.

711
01:15:47,788 --> 01:15:50,171
What about Steven?

712
01:15:50,171 --> 01:15:52,673
Forget him.

713
01:15:52,673 --> 01:15:55,811
- Forget him?
- He ain't gonna make it.

714
01:15:55,811 --> 01:15:58,273
Who do you think
you are? God?

715
01:16:00,378 --> 01:16:02,285
Look at him.
He's in a daze.

716
01:16:02,285 --> 01:16:04,668
He ain't comin' out.
He's in a dream.

717
01:16:04,668 --> 01:16:06,574
Mike, what are you saying?

718
01:16:06,574 --> 01:16:08,480
I'm saying forget him.

719
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,387
Get it through your head,

720
01:16:10,387 --> 01:16:12,650
or you and me are both gone too.

721
01:16:19,879 --> 01:16:21,785
We gotta play with more bullets.

722
01:16:21,785 --> 01:16:23,612
- What?
- More bullets.

723
01:16:25,796 --> 01:16:29,609
I gotta get more bullets
in the gun.

724
01:16:29,688 --> 01:16:32,071
- What?
- We gotta play with more bullets.

725
01:16:32,071 --> 01:16:34,176
- More bullets in the gun?
- More bullets in the gun.

726
01:16:34,176 --> 01:16:37,036
How many more bullets?

727
01:16:37,036 --> 01:16:39,220
Three.

728
01:16:46,448 --> 01:16:48,951
That means we gotta play each other.

729
01:16:48,951 --> 01:16:51,333
- More bullets against each oth--
- We gotta do it.

730
01:16:51,333 --> 01:16:54,670
- What? Are you crazy?
- Nicky, it's the only way.

731
01:16:57,013 --> 01:16:59,991
I'll pick the moment.
The game goes until I move.

732
01:16:59,991 --> 01:17:02,454
When I start shootin',
go for the nearest guard,

733
01:17:02,454 --> 01:17:04,638
get his gun,
zap the fucker.

734
01:17:04,638 --> 01:17:07,617
- I'm not ready for this.
- You gotta listen to me.

735
01:17:07,617 --> 01:17:09,682
You wanna stay
down here and die?

736
01:17:11,032 --> 01:17:14,091
Go on.
It's up to you.

737
01:17:14,091 --> 01:17:15,997
- Now it's up to you.
- No!

738
01:17:15,997 --> 01:17:17,903
- No!
- Hey, him against me!

739
01:17:17,903 --> 01:17:20,088
Side by side!

740
01:17:20,088 --> 01:17:25,012
- Side by side!
- Get away! Get away!

741
01:17:25,012 --> 01:17:26,839
Me and him!
Me against him!

742
01:17:27,872 --> 01:17:32,280
Michael!

743
01:18:06,714 --> 01:18:10,248
Come on! These fuckers--

744
01:18:10,248 --> 01:18:12,353
These fuckers--
Go ahead, Nicky. Go ahead, Nicky.

745
01:18:12,353 --> 01:18:15,213
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be all right.

746
01:18:15,213 --> 01:18:17,397
Go ahead. Go ahead, Nicky.

747
01:18:33,204 --> 01:18:35,587
I do three bullets.
Three.

748
01:18:35,587 --> 01:18:37,573
Three. We do three, huh?

749
01:18:37,573 --> 01:18:39,479
One, two, three.
Three.

750
01:18:49,408 --> 01:18:51,394
Three. Three.

751
01:18:56,914 --> 01:18:59,496
Three. Three.

752
01:19:02,435 --> 01:19:05,970
Don't worry. Five minutes,
we're gonna be outta here.

753
01:19:05,970 --> 01:19:07,757
We're gonna be outta here.

754
01:19:09,663 --> 01:19:11,490
Yeah.

755
01:19:17,408 --> 01:19:19,274
Now we got ourselves a game.

756
01:19:19,274 --> 01:19:21,181
You and me.
You and me.

757
01:19:21,181 --> 01:19:23,008
Now we got ourselves a game.

758
01:19:42,349 --> 01:19:44,533
Okay. Okay.

759
01:19:44,533 --> 01:19:46,440
You wanna see it?
All right.

760
01:19:50,054 --> 01:19:51,841
There.

761
01:20:00,698 --> 01:20:03,279
No more. No. No more.

762
01:20:08,204 --> 01:20:10,110
I'm gonna will us out of here.

763
01:20:10,110 --> 01:20:12,017
You got an empty chamber in that gun.

764
01:20:12,017 --> 01:20:13,923
Put an empty chamber
in that gun!

765
01:20:13,923 --> 01:20:16,783
Go ahead.

766
01:20:22,025 --> 01:20:24,011
Goddamn it!

767
01:20:24,011 --> 01:20:25,917
It's gonna be all right, Nicky.

768
01:20:25,917 --> 01:20:27,824
Go ahead, shoot!
Shoot, Nicky!

769
01:20:27,824 --> 01:20:30,206
Goddamn you,

770
01:20:30,206 --> 01:20:33,463
You motherf--

771
01:20:33,463 --> 01:20:35,449
No, no, no, no, Nicky!

772
01:20:35,449 --> 01:20:37,911
Oh! You cock--

773
01:20:37,911 --> 01:20:40,771
Oh! Oh, you're gonna die,
you motherfucker!

774
01:20:40,771 --> 01:20:42,598
You're gonna die!

775
01:20:44,504 --> 01:20:46,410
Go ahead.
Go ahead, Nicky.

776
01:20:46,410 --> 01:20:49,548
Just do it. Do it.
Do it! Do it!

777
01:20:49,548 --> 01:20:51,454
Go ahead!

778
01:20:56,697 --> 01:20:58,484
You made it.
You made it.

779
01:21:03,528 --> 01:21:05,434
It's all right, Nicky.

780
01:21:05,434 --> 01:21:09,247
All right,
we're gonna show 'em.

781
01:21:09,922 --> 01:21:12,504
That's good, Nicky.

782
01:21:16,197 --> 01:21:20,010
All right. All right.

783
01:22:00,469 --> 01:22:02,852
Come on, Nicky.
Come on.

784
01:22:02,852 --> 01:22:04,758
Come on! Nicky--

785
01:22:04,758 --> 01:22:07,260
Come on.

786
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:10,199
Nicky, come on.
Damn it!

787
01:22:10,199 --> 01:22:12,106
Come on!

788
01:22:15,322 --> 01:22:17,229
Shit.

789
01:22:20,684 --> 01:22:23,146
Get me up.

790
01:22:24,973 --> 01:22:26,880
Steve!

791
01:22:29,898 --> 01:22:31,804
Get up. Get up.

792
01:22:31,804 --> 01:22:33,631
Get up!

793
01:22:37,246 --> 01:22:39,430
Michael. Michael.

794
01:22:40,939 --> 01:22:42,766
Michael!

795
01:22:46,460 --> 01:22:48,366
Stevie, come on.
Come on, Stevie.

796
01:22:48,366 --> 01:22:50,272
We're gonna go for a swim.
Come on.

797
01:22:50,272 --> 01:22:52,457
Stevie.

798
01:22:52,457 --> 01:22:54,284
Come on. Come on.

799
01:22:57,223 --> 01:23:01,035
We don't belong
here in the jungle, Michael.

800
01:23:02,266 --> 01:23:04,967
Get on. Go on.
Just get on, see?

801
01:23:04,967 --> 01:23:09,812
- Just get on.
- There's rats in these waters.

802
01:23:09,812 --> 01:23:12,275
- These w--
- Hold on.

803
01:23:12,275 --> 01:23:14,181
Hold on right there.

804
01:23:14,181 --> 01:23:16,008
Hold on.

805
01:23:27,656 --> 01:23:29,761
- Michael.
- Okay, buddy.

806
01:23:35,837 --> 01:23:37,664
Mike.

807
01:23:43,185 --> 01:23:45,727
Nicky!

808
01:24:06,498 --> 01:24:09,834
Mike!

809
01:24:09,834 --> 01:24:11,740
I wanna go home, Mike.

810
01:25:11,830 --> 01:25:13,736
What is that sound?

811
01:25:15,166 --> 01:25:17,549
What's that sound, Michael?

812
01:25:29,623 --> 01:25:33,435
- Hey! Hey! Hey!
- Hey!

813
01:26:38,172 --> 01:26:40,078
Go ahead! Go ahead!

814
01:26:41,031 --> 01:26:43,256
Mike! Mike!

815
01:26:43,256 --> 01:26:46,115
Hold on, Michael! Don't let go!

816
01:26:47,505 --> 01:26:49,531
Mike!

817
01:26:54,177 --> 01:26:56,957
No! Mike!

818
01:27:33,059 --> 01:27:35,998
Stevie!

819
01:27:57,047 --> 01:27:59,430
I hit some rocks, Michael.

820
01:27:59,430 --> 01:28:01,337
I hit some rocks.

821
01:28:01,337 --> 01:28:03,243
- Are you all right?
- Michael.

822
01:28:03,243 --> 01:28:05,507
- Okay.
- My legs--

823
01:28:07,492 --> 01:28:09,319
Come on. Come on.

824
01:28:10,670 --> 01:28:14,443
Stevie, come on.

825
01:28:19,685 --> 01:28:21,592
M-Mike,

826
01:28:21,592 --> 01:28:23,617
I hit some rocks.

827
01:28:24,570 --> 01:28:26,477
Okay.

828
01:28:26,477 --> 01:28:28,383
All right.

829
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:33,506
That's it.

830
01:28:33,506 --> 01:28:35,810
- That's it.
- My arm.

831
01:28:37,716 --> 01:28:40,933
I can't feel my legs.

832
01:28:41,966 --> 01:28:44,269
All right. Come on.

833
01:28:52,848 --> 01:28:55,231
Push yourself up.

834
01:29:06,947 --> 01:29:11,316
Shh!

835
01:29:11,316 --> 01:29:15,128
Okay. Okay, kid. Okay.

836
01:29:15,208 --> 01:29:19,020
Shh! Shh!

837
01:31:33,180 --> 01:31:35,007
Hi.

838
01:31:39,495 --> 01:31:41,282
Hi.

839
01:32:44,231 --> 01:32:46,137
Ah.

840
01:32:54,015 --> 01:32:56,994
Are you Nikanor Chevotarevich?

841
01:32:59,099 --> 01:33:01,442
Can you understand me, Nikanor?

842
01:33:04,619 --> 01:33:06,605
Excuse me?

843
01:33:06,605 --> 01:33:08,790
- Are you Chevotarevich? Are you sure?
- Yes.

844
01:33:08,790 --> 01:33:12,602
Uh-huh. Chevotarevich.
Is that a Russian name?

845
01:33:15,740 --> 01:33:18,599
No. It's American.

846
01:33:18,599 --> 01:33:20,704
All right.
Let me see your name tag.

847
01:33:22,889 --> 01:33:26,701
- This yours?
- It's his.

848
01:33:26,701 --> 01:33:32,301
- What are your parents' names?
- Lou and, uh--

849
01:33:32,301 --> 01:33:35,558
My mother's name is, uh--

850
01:33:35,558 --> 01:33:39,847
- Tsk. Eva.
- Uh-huh.

851
01:33:39,847 --> 01:33:42,707
And what are your parents'
dates of birth?

852
01:33:49,657 --> 01:33:54,304
What the--

853
01:34:25,838 --> 01:34:29,651
We're gonna have
to get him outta here.

854
01:34:57,578 --> 01:34:59,405
Sure, sure.

855
01:35:01,113 --> 01:35:03,496
Excuse me.

856
01:35:05,283 --> 01:35:09,572
Some more noise, uh-huh.

857
01:35:09,572 --> 01:35:12,074
Hello?

858
01:35:13,027 --> 01:35:17,118
Uh, I'm calling
the United States.

859
01:35:18,627 --> 01:35:21,487
Clairton, Pennsylvania.

860
01:35:23,671 --> 01:35:28,437
C-L-A...

861
01:35:28,437 --> 01:35:31,217
I-R-T-O-N.

862
01:35:31,217 --> 01:35:34,712
Pennsylvania. Right.

863
01:35:34,712 --> 01:35:38,167
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

864
01:35:41,861 --> 01:35:44,244
Never mind.

865
01:35:44,244 --> 01:35:47,103
Nothing, nothing.
No. Never mind. Nothing.

866
01:35:56,436 --> 01:36:00,249
Hey, back off, Jack!
Back off.

867
01:36:00,527 --> 01:36:04,340
Well, just do that.

868
01:36:46,121 --> 01:36:48,027
Mike?

869
01:36:48,027 --> 01:36:49,933
Hello. How are you?

870
01:36:49,933 --> 01:36:51,840
- Hey.
- Mike?

871
01:36:54,501 --> 01:36:58,313
Mike? Hey, Mike.

872
01:36:58,433 --> 01:37:01,451
Sorry. I thought
you were someone else.

873
01:37:15,749 --> 01:37:19,561
-"Too much for the man"
-"Too much for the man"

874
01:37:19,561 --> 01:37:21,666
"He couldn't make it"

875
01:37:21,666 --> 01:37:25,479
"So he's leavin'
the life he's"

876
01:37:25,558 --> 01:37:28,021
"He's come to know"

877
01:37:28,021 --> 01:37:29,927
"Ooh, ooh"

878
01:37:29,927 --> 01:37:34,892
-"He said he's goin'"
-"He said he's going back to find"

879
01:37:34,892 --> 01:37:36,798
"Going back to find"

880
01:37:36,798 --> 01:37:40,055
"Ooh, ooh, ooh
What's left of his world"

881
01:37:42,040 --> 01:37:45,456
"The world he left behind"

882
01:37:45,456 --> 01:37:50,142
"Not so long ago"

883
01:37:50,142 --> 01:37:53,002
- How are you?
- Okay.

884
01:37:53,002 --> 01:37:55,067
"He's leavin'"

885
01:37:55,067 --> 01:38:00,707
-"On that midnight train to Georgia"
- I show you. Come.

886
01:38:00,707 --> 01:38:04,519
-"Yeah"
- Not like the girls home in U.S.A.

887
01:38:04,519 --> 01:38:06,505
- I make you crazy.
-"Goin' back to find"

888
01:38:06,505 --> 01:38:09,841
-"To a simpler place and time"
- I make you crazy.

889
01:38:09,841 --> 01:38:12,423
-"Oh, yes, he is"
-"Guess who's gonna be right by his side"

890
01:38:12,423 --> 01:38:16,037
- No, I don't wanna.
- Come.

891
01:38:16,037 --> 01:38:20,326
"Leavin' on that
midnight train to Georgia"

892
01:38:20,326 --> 01:38:23,345
"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah"

893
01:38:23,345 --> 01:38:26,323
"I'd rather live in his world"

894
01:38:26,323 --> 01:38:29,540
"Than live without him in mine"

895
01:38:32,797 --> 01:38:36,014
"Mmm, L.A."

896
01:38:36,014 --> 01:38:37,920
Come on inside.

897
01:38:46,975 --> 01:38:51,146
Okay, what you like
call me now, hmm?

898
01:38:51,146 --> 01:38:54,601
What you like call me?

899
01:38:54,601 --> 01:38:57,182
- Linda.
- Linda. Just like home.

900
01:38:57,182 --> 01:39:00,201
No, no.
Thank you.

901
01:39:00,201 --> 01:39:03,338
Come back here.
Come back here.

902
01:39:03,338 --> 01:39:07,826
- Call-- Call-- Call me Linda.
- Hey, look.

903
01:39:07,826 --> 01:39:10,964
Elephants.

904
01:39:10,964 --> 01:39:13,347
I gotta get an elephant.

905
01:39:13,347 --> 01:39:15,809
No!

906
01:39:15,809 --> 01:39:18,192
I can't stay here in a room
with a kid cryin'.

907
01:39:18,192 --> 01:39:20,297
- Come on.
- No. No!

908
01:39:20,297 --> 01:39:24,110
Why don't you pay me first?
Fuck you!

909
01:39:26,215 --> 01:39:30,980
Oh. Oh.

910
01:40:58,661 --> 01:41:01,778
People inside
doing it for money?

911
01:41:01,778 --> 01:41:05,565
Sometime a great deal of money.

912
01:41:05,565 --> 01:41:08,208
I cannot play
this kind of game myself.

913
01:41:08,208 --> 01:41:11,522
But I'm always--
How do you say?

914
01:41:11,522 --> 01:41:16,058
Looking out for those things
quite different, quite rare.

915
01:41:17,675 --> 01:41:20,436
Champagne, perhaps?

916
01:41:20,436 --> 01:41:22,330
No.

917
01:41:22,330 --> 01:41:25,920
Tsk, tsk. Don't say no.

918
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:29,707
When a man say no to champagne,
he say no to life.

919
01:41:33,849 --> 01:41:36,294
You saw this before?

920
01:41:38,385 --> 01:41:40,672
Up north.

921
01:41:40,672 --> 01:41:42,921
Oh, yes. Of course.

922
01:41:42,921 --> 01:41:47,655
- Gotta go.
- But you must come in.

923
01:41:47,655 --> 01:41:50,101
I insist.

924
01:41:52,862 --> 01:41:57,201
Of what is there to be afraid of
after this war? War is a joke.

925
01:41:57,201 --> 01:41:59,765
- A silly thing.
- I'm going home, ace!

926
01:41:59,765 --> 01:42:02,605
Naturellement
I pay my players...

927
01:42:02,605 --> 01:42:05,642
cash, American.

928
01:42:05,642 --> 01:42:10,376
However, should you prefer German marks
or perhaps Swiss franc,

929
01:42:10,376 --> 01:42:12,349
that, of course,
can be arranged.

930
01:42:12,349 --> 01:42:15,189
- I can arrange everything.
- You got the wrong guy, ace.

931
01:42:15,189 --> 01:42:17,556
- But you must come in.
- Don't do that.

932
01:42:17,556 --> 01:42:20,002
But I insist.

933
01:43:33,966 --> 01:43:35,583
Nick!

934
01:43:56,293 --> 01:43:57,319
Hey, Nick!

935
01:44:20,592 --> 01:44:23,432
Hey! Nick! Nick!

936
01:44:22,655 --> 01:44:26,916
- Listen, if you are very brave and lucky,
- Hey, Nick!

937
01:44:26,916 --> 01:44:29,755
I can make you
very, very rich.

938
01:45:03,443 --> 01:45:06,718
Wow. Would you
look at that?

939
01:45:08,611 --> 01:45:11,372
- Just keep goin'. Just keep goin'.
- You said Logan Street.

940
01:45:11,372 --> 01:45:13,937
- I just want to keep goin'.
- The trailer. It's right there.

941
01:45:13,937 --> 01:45:17,053
Just wait 'til Michael
gets here, huh?

942
01:45:17,053 --> 01:45:20,248
This is it!
This is Michael!

943
01:45:20,248 --> 01:45:22,339
- Oh!
- All right.

944
01:45:22,339 --> 01:45:26,126
Everybody, stay where you are!
I'll go get him.

945
01:45:26,204 --> 01:45:28,375
Three cheers
for the red, white and blue.

946
01:45:28,375 --> 01:45:32,161
Hip, hip, hurray!
Hip, hip, hurray!

947
01:45:32,359 --> 01:45:36,066
Hip, hip, hurray!

948
01:45:45,432 --> 01:45:48,193
- That cab ain't stoppin'.
- What's goin' on?

949
01:45:51,783 --> 01:45:56,437
I can't wait for him
to see all this stuff.

950
01:45:56,437 --> 01:46:00,027
- What happened?
- Hey, Stosh, what happened? I thought it was him.

951
01:46:00,027 --> 01:46:05,589
So his plane could be late.
Take it easy, will ya, Axel? You're drivin' everyone nuts.

952
01:46:08,035 --> 01:46:10,126
You okay?

953
01:46:17,147 --> 01:46:20,145
I know Nick will be back soon.

954
01:46:20,145 --> 01:46:24,326
I know Nick.
He'll be comin' back too.

955
01:46:24,326 --> 01:46:27,521
- Right, Axel?
- Fuckin' A.

956
01:46:27,521 --> 01:46:31,901
- Go straight on down to the highway.
- It's your bread, man.

957
01:50:04,234 --> 01:50:06,324
It's open!

958
01:50:19,066 --> 01:50:22,852
Forget something--
Michael?

959
01:50:24,273 --> 01:50:28,928
Oh, Michael! Oh!

960
01:50:28,928 --> 01:50:32,714
Oh, Michael!
Oh, Michael!

961
01:50:32,990 --> 01:50:35,160
Tsk! Oh, my God.

962
01:50:35,160 --> 01:50:38,671
Oh, gee.

963
01:50:38,671 --> 01:50:41,787
Gee, you look beautiful.

964
01:50:41,787 --> 01:50:45,377
Oh, uh, let me
take your coat.

965
01:50:45,377 --> 01:50:48,888
Oh! Everybody was here.
You missed them all.

966
01:50:48,888 --> 01:50:54,371
Oh. They're gonna be so mad
when they find out they missed you.

967
01:50:57,960 --> 01:50:59,735
Welcome home.

968
01:51:05,140 --> 01:51:07,506
You know, I was hopin'--

969
01:51:07,506 --> 01:51:12,596
I was hopin' somehow, Michael,
maybe you had... Nick with you.

970
01:51:12,596 --> 01:51:16,856
No. No.

971
01:51:26,509 --> 01:51:28,876
You hear anything on Nick?

972
01:51:30,966 --> 01:51:32,939
No.

973
01:51:34,753 --> 01:51:36,923
Nothing.
He's A.W.O.L.

974
01:51:36,923 --> 01:51:38,816
That's all we know.

975
01:51:38,816 --> 01:51:41,183
Tsk.

976
01:51:41,183 --> 01:51:42,800
He'll be back.

977
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:46,943
He never wrote to me.
He never called me.

978
01:51:46,943 --> 01:51:48,836
Maybe you were out.

979
01:51:50,927 --> 01:51:52,741
Yeah. Maybe.

980
01:51:57,909 --> 01:51:59,999
So how are you anyway?

981
01:51:59,999 --> 01:52:02,761
I'm fine. Okay.
How are you?

982
01:52:02,761 --> 01:52:06,075
Uh, me? I'm okay.

983
01:52:06,075 --> 01:52:08,046
I'm fine.
I go along, you know.

984
01:52:08,046 --> 01:52:12,662
Still workin' at the market there.
There's a million things to do.

985
01:52:12,662 --> 01:52:15,897
Y-You sure
you're all right, huh?

986
01:52:15,897 --> 01:52:19,210
- Yeah, I'm all right.
- What about your wounds?

987
01:52:19,210 --> 01:52:23,826
It was nothin'.
Just the usual complications, that's all.

988
01:52:23,826 --> 01:52:27,612
- We heard.
- No, that's not true, a lot of guys go through it.

989
01:52:27,731 --> 01:52:31,518
Hmm. Tsk.

990
01:52:31,794 --> 01:52:34,989
I made Nick that sweater.

991
01:52:40,669 --> 01:52:43,904
I couldn't remember
the exact size, but--

992
01:52:43,904 --> 01:52:46,823
I think he's about
the same size as you, huh?

993
01:52:49,585 --> 01:52:54,279
No. Too big. Whoops.

994
01:52:54,279 --> 01:52:57,395
Well, I could fix that, though.
I mean--

995
01:52:57,395 --> 01:53:00,077
One thing about wool,
it's really a cinch...

996
01:53:02,996 --> 01:53:04,890
to fix.

997
01:53:06,890 --> 01:53:09,138
Oh, Christ.

998
01:53:11,900 --> 01:53:15,687
It's okay.

999
01:53:19,356 --> 01:53:21,249
It's okay.

1000
01:53:21,249 --> 01:53:25,785
- How's your job?
- Great. Fine. Yeah.

1001
01:53:25,785 --> 01:53:28,941
Once or twice
we almost had to close.

1002
01:53:28,941 --> 01:53:30,716
I gotta go to work now.

1003
01:53:32,413 --> 01:53:34,504
- Gotta go now?
- Yeah.

1004
01:53:34,504 --> 01:53:39,040
Uh, would you mind
if I walked you to work?

1005
01:53:40,460 --> 01:53:45,272
Mikie, you're so... weird.

1006
01:53:45,272 --> 01:53:48,310
You're always such a gentleman.

1007
01:53:48,310 --> 01:53:50,479
Tsk. Well--

1008
01:53:55,134 --> 01:53:57,107
- It's cold out there.
- Yeah.

1009
01:53:57,107 --> 01:53:59,947
I'm not used to it.

1010
01:53:59,947 --> 01:54:03,339
Oh, I'm so glad you're alive.

1011
01:54:03,339 --> 01:54:06,179
I'm so happy.

1012
01:54:07,521 --> 01:54:09,888
I really don't know
what I feel.

1013
01:54:37,501 --> 01:54:39,946
- Hey, Jack.
- Hello. How are you?

1014
01:54:59,828 --> 01:55:03,142
Linda, uh,
I just want to say...

1015
01:55:03,142 --> 01:55:05,587
how sorry I am about Nick.

1016
01:55:05,587 --> 01:55:09,847
And how-- I know how much
you loved him and...

1017
01:55:09,847 --> 01:55:13,438
I know that it'll
never be the same.

1018
01:55:13,438 --> 01:55:16,632
I just wanted
to tell you that.

1019
01:55:16,632 --> 01:55:20,419
Maybe-- I don't know--
Maybe you don't want to talk about it.

1020
01:55:34,621 --> 01:55:38,881
How's it goin', hot lips?

1021
01:55:38,881 --> 01:55:43,022
Yeah, a new kid.
A real tough guy.

1022
01:55:44,167 --> 01:55:46,455
It's okay.

1023
01:55:47,480 --> 01:55:50,321
Mike.

1024
01:55:50,321 --> 01:55:53,831
Why don't you come in with me?
Just say hello.

1025
01:55:53,831 --> 01:55:57,302
Oh, Mike, please.
They want to see you. I know.

1026
01:55:57,302 --> 01:55:59,393
Just for a second, okay?
Okay.

1027
01:55:59,393 --> 01:56:03,180
Hey, look who's here.
It's Michael. Hey, everybody.

1028
01:56:04,877 --> 01:56:08,663
- Oh, Michael, I read about you in the paper.
- Helen!

1029
01:56:08,742 --> 01:56:11,582
- Let me--
- Oh, Michael. Oh, dear.

1030

01:56:14,147 --> 01:56:16,158

01:56:16,158 --> 01:56:20,301
- You look good, Mike. Welcome back.
- We're glad he's home.

1033
01:56:20,301 --> 01:56:23,811
- Wait a minute. Look at his medals.
- Congratulations.

1034
01:56:23,811 --> 01:56:27,124

- Oh, Michael.

1035
01:56:27,124 --> 01:56:31,661
- Helen! Come on.
- Janie, leave me alone.

1036
01:56:31,661 --> 01:56:34,659
We really won over there,
huh, Mike? We won.

1037
01:56:34,659 --> 01:56:39,511

01:57:29,716 --> 01:57:32,004
Hey, Axel. Hey, Stosh. Axhead.

01:57:32,004 --> 01:57:34,765

01:57:42,300 --> 01:57:44,509
We had everything all set there.
Beer, food.

1052
01:57:44,509 --> 01:57:49,045
- Fuckin' A.

1053
01:57:49,045 --> 01:57:51,688

- Hey--

1054
01:57:52,714 --> 01:57:55,633
- You got a mustache.
- Yeah.

1055
01:57:55,633 --> 01:57:57,644
Looks pretty good.

1056
01:57:57,644 --> 01:58:00,958
- It looks cute.
- Yeah, it looks--

1057
01:58:00,958 --> 01:58:04,153
Come on.
We're goin' to John's.

1058
01:58:04,153 --> 01:58:07,586
So how you guys been?

1059
01:58:07,586 --> 01:58:09,913
Hangin' in there.
You know.

1060
01:58:09,913 --> 01:58:12,004
How's it feel to be shot?

1061
01:58:12,004 --> 01:58:15,041
- It don't.
- Oh.

1062
01:58:15,041 --> 01:58:17,604
It don't hurt.
If that's what you wanna know.

1063
01:58:17,604 --> 01:58:20,327
How youse been?
Been okay?

1064
01:58:20,327 --> 01:58:22,970
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1065
01:58:22,970 --> 01:58:26,480
Same old thing, you know.
Nothing's changed.

1066
01:58:26,480 --> 01:58:30,071
I'm gettin' more ass than a toilet seat,
and Axel's gettin' fatter than ever.

1067
01:58:31,571 --> 01:58:36,975
Hey! Hey, Stan,
why don't you show him that gun?

1068
01:58:36,975 --> 01:58:39,420
Shh! Take it easy.

1069
01:58:39,420 --> 01:58:41,589
That little pussy thing you carry
around back there. Look at that.

1070
01:58:41,589 --> 01:58:43,878
- Watch it.
- What's that for?

1071
01:58:43,878 --> 01:58:46,245
- Same thing the other one was for.
- And what was that for?

1072
01:58:46,245 --> 01:58:48,414
- He's a worrier.
- Ah, forget it.

1073
01:58:48,414 --> 01:58:50,505
- Let's go have a drink.
- Yeah, let's get a drink.

1074
01:58:50,505 --> 01:58:52,398
"So long time forgotten"

1075
01:58:52,398 --> 01:58:56,935
-"Seems a good spell that I loved you"
- Look what I found.

1076
01:58:56,935 --> 01:58:58,907
Hey, Mikie!

1077
01:58:58,907 --> 01:59:02,418
Let this man through!
Let him through!

1078
01:59:04,864 --> 01:59:07,782
Hey, John!
Good to see ya!

1079
01:59:07,782 --> 01:59:11,569
Boy, oh, boy!

1080
01:59:11,688 --> 01:59:13,660
Come on.
Come on in the back.

1081
01:59:13,660 --> 01:59:19,814
In the back.
Come on!

1082
01:59:22,734 --> 01:59:24,824
What the hell's
goin' on here?

1083
01:59:24,824 --> 01:59:27,940
- Goddamn.
- Stosh, get the glasses on the sink.

1084
01:59:27,940 --> 01:59:31,648
- The dirty ones?
- Yeah, use the dirty ones.

1085
01:59:31,648 --> 01:59:34,962
Holy shit! What did you do?

1086
01:59:34,962 --> 01:59:37,290
Win the war
all by yourself?

1087
01:59:37,290 --> 01:59:39,183
- Look at this stuff.
- No help from you.

1088
01:59:39,183 --> 01:59:40,919
- Huh?
- Here we go!

1089
01:59:40,919 --> 01:59:45,455
Misha. Na zdorovije.
To you, Mike.

1090
01:59:45,455 --> 01:59:47,348
Na zdorovije to everybody.

1091
01:59:47,348 --> 01:59:50,071
- Fuckin' A.
- Na zdorovije!

1092
01:59:50,071 --> 01:59:52,161
- Na zdorovije!
- Hey! Hey!

1093
01:59:52,161 --> 01:59:55,081
Wait, wait!
To Nick and Steve!

1094
01:59:55,081 --> 01:59:58,038
- To Nick and Steve.
- Nick and Steve.

1095
02:00:10,281 --> 02:00:12,727
You look great.

1096
02:00:16,632 --> 02:00:18,684
How's Angela?

1097
02:00:23,614 --> 02:00:27,874
- Not so good, Mike, worse since she talked to him.
- Talked to who?

1098
02:00:27,874 --> 02:00:29,492
Steven.

1099
02:00:29,492 --> 02:00:32,806
She talked to Steve?
I didn't know he was back.

1100
02:00:32,806 --> 02:00:35,803
- You didn't know he's back?
- Oh, Jesus.

1101
02:00:35,803 --> 02:00:39,038
No, I didn't know.
Is he back?

1102
02:00:39,038 --> 02:00:42,234
- You-- You-- You didn't--
- Where is he? Where is he?

1103
02:00:42,234 --> 02:00:43,772
- Come on, John.
- Come on.

1104
02:00:43,772 --> 02:00:45,073
Where is he?

1105
02:00:45,073 --> 02:00:47,164
- I don't know.
- Just answer me. Where is he?

1106
02:00:47,164 --> 02:00:50,359
- Just tell me where he is?
- I don't know where he is, Mike.

1107
02:00:50,281 --> 02:00:54,015
- Angela wouldn't tell us. Mike.
- What do you mean?

1108
02:00:54,015 --> 02:00:56,000
She wouldn't talk to anybody!

1109
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,185
- Is that true?
- Yeah.

1110
02:01:19,175 --> 02:01:21,082
Boom!

1111
02:01:32,877 --> 02:01:34,863
Angela.

1112
02:01:36,769 --> 02:01:40,582
I heard Steven was alive.
Where is he?

1113
02:01:45,149 --> 02:01:47,135
Where's Steven?

1114
02:01:49,359 --> 02:01:53,172
Where is he?
Just tell me where it is.

1115
02:01:55,992 --> 02:01:58,017
Angela, where is Steve?

1116
02:01:58,017 --> 02:02:02,465
- Uh, uh--
- Just tell me where he is.

1117
02:02:04,292 --> 02:02:09,733
Where is he?

1118
02:02:09,733 --> 02:02:13,069
Please.

1119
02:02:13,069 --> 02:02:16,207
You gotta tell me.
Now where is he?

1120
02:02:16,207 --> 02:02:19,344
Do you know?
Where is he?

1121
02:02:48,655 --> 02:02:50,680
Take care.

1122
02:03:37,694 --> 02:03:40,554
Michael?

1123
02:03:40,554 --> 02:03:42,539
Right here.

1124
02:03:42,539 --> 02:03:45,002
- Whatcha doin'?
- Nothin'.

1125
02:03:45,002 --> 02:03:47,305
Just got my gear,
and I was gonna go.

1126
02:03:47,305 --> 02:03:49,212
- What?
- I was gonna go.

1127
02:03:49,212 --> 02:03:52,151
Don't go.
I have, uh, all this food.

1128
02:03:52,151 --> 02:03:54,534
I'll make you
a nice sit-down dinner.

1129
02:03:54,534 --> 02:03:57,870
- I-l can't.
- Mikie.

1130
02:04:03,192 --> 02:04:05,217
Why don't we go to bed?

1131
02:04:09,109 --> 02:04:12,922
C-Can't we just comfort
each other?

1132
02:04:13,001 --> 02:04:16,814
No, I can't. Not here.
I gotta get outta here.

1133
02:04:17,013 --> 02:04:19,475
Sorry.
I just gotta get out.

1134
02:04:19,475 --> 02:04:21,659
I'll be--
Look, I don't know.

1135
02:04:21,659 --> 02:04:25,750
I feel a lot of distance,
and I feel far away. I'll see ya later.

1136
02:04:59,389 --> 02:05:03,202
It feels kind of weird...

1137
02:05:03,202 --> 02:05:05,386
comin' to a motel.

1138
02:05:05,386 --> 02:05:07,293
You know what I mean, Michael?

1139
02:05:07,293 --> 02:05:11,105
Mike?

1140
02:06:03,474 --> 02:06:06,056
Go ahead.

1141
02:06:06,056 --> 02:06:09,868
I got to put my can down
for this one.

1142
02:06:09,868 --> 02:06:13,681
Ha! Ha!

1143
02:06:19,956 --> 02:06:25,675
"Here we are
staring at each other"

1144
02:06:28,257 --> 02:06:33,856
"With that crazy look
in our eyes"

1145
02:06:33,856 --> 02:06:36,438
Michael, it's on the house.

1146
02:06:36,438 --> 02:06:38,900
-"It happens every time"
- No, thanks.

1147
02:06:38,900 --> 02:06:42,713
"We get together"

1148
02:06:44,540 --> 02:06:50,140
"Did we ever really
say good-bye"

1149
02:06:50,140 --> 02:06:53,476
How ya feelin'?
You okay?

1150
02:06:53,476 --> 02:06:56,614
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1151
02:06:56,614 --> 02:07:01,022
"Then our eyes keep looking
at each other"

1152
02:07:01,022 --> 02:07:04,795
All right!

1153
02:07:04,994 --> 02:07:07,376
Yea, Linda!

1154
02:07:07,376 --> 02:07:11,189
- What do you think of her, Mike?
- I don't know.

1155
02:07:11,388 --> 02:07:15,200
- No, come on. On the level.
- I don't know, Stosh.

1156
02:07:15,280 --> 02:07:19,490
Is she--
Is she beautiful?

1157
02:07:19,490 --> 02:07:22,230
Is she beautiful? ls she?

1158
02:07:25,368 --> 02:07:27,274
- The truth?
- Yeah!

1159
02:07:27,274 --> 02:07:28,704
No.

1160
02:07:28,704 --> 02:07:31,087
No?

1161
02:07:31,087 --> 02:07:34,899
- No.
- Well, do you think she's intelligent?

1162
02:07:35,019 --> 02:07:39,864
- No.
- Neither do I.

1163
02:07:45,464 --> 02:07:48,125
I don't think
she's intelligent either.

1164
02:07:48,125 --> 02:07:53,010
- What the hell you see in her?
- I don't know, that's what I came to ask you.

1165
02:07:53,010 --> 02:07:56,346
- Maybe she's good in bed.
- Why don't you ask her?

1166
02:08:00,437 --> 02:08:03,455
Whoa!

1167
02:08:03,455 --> 02:08:06,712
"Oh, it's somethin'"

1168
02:08:06,712 --> 02:08:10,246
"How they read
between the lines"

1169
02:08:13,185 --> 02:08:17,951
"Tattletale eyes
tell what's on our minds"

1170
02:08:21,009 --> 02:08:23,750
Now where the fuck
is my fuckin' ball?

1171
02:08:23,750 --> 02:08:25,735
Goddamn pinsetter!

1172
02:08:25,735 --> 02:08:28,794
-"Tattletale eyes"
- Where's he goin'?

1173
02:08:28,794 --> 02:08:31,177
Axel! Axel!

1174
02:08:36,141 --> 02:08:37,928
Michael!

1175
02:08:41,860 --> 02:08:44,799
What the hell happened?

1176
02:08:44,799 --> 02:08:48,890
- The pinsetter came down.
- Stan, get the jack out of my trunk.

1177
02:08:52,226 --> 02:08:55,363
Shit. Nothin' works
around this damn place anymore.

1178
02:08:55,363 --> 02:08:57,746
We're gettin' you clear here.

1179
02:08:57,746 --> 02:09:00,209
Watch your elbow here.
All right, you got it.

1180
02:09:00,209 --> 02:09:02,115
All right, belly burn.

1181
02:09:02,115 --> 02:09:04,776
You all right, man?

1182
02:09:04,776 --> 02:09:08,589
- Hey!
- Fuckin' A!

1183
02:09:09,264 --> 02:09:11,845
What do you guys
want to do now, huh?

1184
02:09:11,845 --> 02:09:14,705
- We're goin' huntin', right?
- Who asked you?

1185
02:09:14,705 --> 02:09:17,366
- Who the hell asked you?
- I was askin' Mike.

1186
02:09:17,366 --> 02:09:20,225
- He's goin'.
- Yeah, Mike's goin'.

1187
02:09:20,225 --> 02:09:24,038
- But no women.
- Just like old times, hey, am I right?

1188
02:09:24,038 --> 02:09:27,851
- Just like old times?
- Fuckin' A!

1189
02:10:55,241 --> 02:10:57,307
Are you kiddin' me, Axel?

1190
02:10:57,307 --> 02:11:02,271
Forty times
we could've had it!

1191
02:11:02,271 --> 02:11:04,456
If I'd have been
where you are.

1192
02:11:13,709 --> 02:11:17,879
Go get 'im, Axel!

1193
02:11:19,508 --> 02:11:21,335
Fuck you guys.

1194
02:11:44,358 --> 02:11:48,846
- Oh, how sweet it is.

In case?

1204
02:13:49,790 --> 02:13:51,696
In case you stumble

1205
02:13:51,696 --> 02:13:54,079
sucking on
a forest ranger's cock?

1206
02:13:55,310 --> 02:13:57,693
You say that one more time.

1207
02:13:57,693 --> 02:14:01,228
Say it!
Go on. Say it!

1208
02:14:01,228 --> 02:14:04,167

02:14:11,236 --> 02:14:13,619
- Take it easy, Mike.

1213
02:14:13,619 --> 02:14:16,359
What? You think it was loaded?
Gimme that.

1214
02:14:21,205 --> 02:14:23,508
Don't.

1215
02:14:29,307 --> 02:14:33,040
You wanna play games?
All right, I'll play your fuckin' games.

1216
02:14:37,012 --> 02:14:38,918
- Hey!

1217
02:14:38,918 --> 02:14:42,055
Huh? Huh?

1218
02:14:42,055 --> 02:14:45,868
- Hey!

1219
02:16:04,148 --> 02:16:06,134
Hi, Michael!

1220
02:16:06,134 --> 02:16:08,159
- Linda's in back.

1221
02:16:08,159 --> 02:16:11,019
- Yeah. Hey, how was the hunting?
- It was fine. Thanks.

1222
02:16:21,861 --> 02:16:23,966
Linda, what's the matter?

1223
02:16:27,103 --> 02:16:29,010
I don't know.

1224
02:16:31,472 --> 02:16:34,054
What's the matter?

1225
02:16:34,054 --> 02:16:35,960
Noth--
I don't know.

1226
02:16:40,607 --> 02:16:42,513
Well, it's gotta be somethin'.

1227
02:16:46,524 --> 02:16:48,431
I got the car outside.

1228
02:16:48,431 --> 02:16:50,615
Yeah. Well, that's okay.

1229
02:16:51,846 --> 02:16:53,753
You sure?

1230
02:16:53,753 --> 02:16:56,136
No, it's okay.
Just leave me alone, okay?

1231
02:16:58,161 --> 02:16:59,948
Really.

1232
02:17:14,325 --> 02:17:17,185
Have a nice night.

1233
02:17:17,185 --> 02:17:19,846
Good night!
See you tomorrow.

1234
02:17:24,890 --> 02:17:26,995
Come with me.
We'll get you home.

1235
02:17:29,576 --> 02:17:31,681
No. I think
I'll go with him.

1236
02:17:31,681 --> 02:17:33,468
- Okay? Thanks.
- Well, okay.

1237
02:17:42,404 --> 02:17:45,939
You okay?

1238
02:17:48,242 --> 02:17:50,983
Did you ever think life
would turn out like this?

1239
02:17:53,842 --> 02:17:55,669
No.

1240
02:20:21,996 --> 02:20:23,823
"I" 27.

1241
02:20:27,159 --> 02:20:29,741
- "N" 40.
- Bingo!

1242
02:20:29,741 --> 02:20:33,434
We have a bingo.
Johnny-come-lately.

1243
02:20:33,434 --> 02:20:35,738
Where are you, Johnny?

1244
02:20:35,738 --> 02:20:37,644
There you are.

1245
02:20:37,644 --> 02:20:40,027
- "B" 15. "I" 16.
- Right.

1246
02:20:40,027 --> 02:20:41,933
- Right.
- "N" 33.

1247
02:20:41,933 --> 02:20:43,840
- Right.
- "G" 60.

1248
02:20:43,840 --> 02:20:46,501
We-- Yeah.
That's a winner.

1249
02:20:46,501 --> 02:20:48,764
Get outta my road there,
lvan Stivan.

1250
02:20:48,764 --> 02:20:51,068
I can't see myself smokin'.

1251
02:20:51,068 --> 02:20:53,530
And the next number: "I" 16.

1252
02:20:53,530 --> 02:20:57,065
Wish it was I.
Nice sweet 16.

1253
02:20:57,065 --> 02:20:58,971
"I" 18.

1254
02:20:58,971 --> 02:21:00,878
Then you become a man.

1255
02:21:00,878 --> 02:21:03,340
Let's go, men. "G" 60.

1256
02:21:03,340 --> 02:21:05,643
And those that can't
help themselves,

1257
02:21:05,643 --> 02:21:08,384
please, buddy,
help them too.

1258
02:21:08,384 --> 02:21:10,290
Oh, will you dance with me?

1259
02:21:10,290 --> 02:21:13,070
"G" 47.

1260
02:21:13,070 --> 02:21:16,883
But I'm still satisfied
with what I've got,

1261
02:21:16,962 --> 02:21:18,948
that wonderful life I've lived.

1262
02:21:18,948 --> 02:21:20,974
Think it over, buddy boys,

1263
02:21:20,974 --> 02:21:23,714
and I'll give you "O" 61.

1264
02:21:27,924 --> 02:21:30,386
Hi. How ya doin'?

1265
02:21:30,386 --> 02:21:32,213

Steven, there's a call for you.

1267
02:21:37,535 --> 02:21:39,322
Maybe it's from Angela.

1268
02:22:06,289 --> 02:22:09,347

1269

1282
02:22:50,652 --> 02:22:52,558
Huh?

1283
02:22:52,558 --> 02:22:54,862
It's like a resort.

1284
02:22:54,862 --> 02:22:59,230
You know? I mean,

1285

1314
02:25:10,451 --> 02:25:13,310
- You didn't get a deer?
- Didn't get anything.

1315
02:25:13,310 --> 02:25:15,415
- Huh?
- No. Uh, no.

1316
02:25:15,415 --> 02:25:18,632

Slipped away.

1317
02:25:18,632 --> 02:25:20,539
Oh! Oh.

1318
02:25:20,539 --> 02:25:22,723
Angela didn't send you?

1319
02:25:22,723 --> 02:25:25,781
- She didn't send you here?
- Angela? No.

1320
02:25:25,781 --> 02:25:29,594

Yeah. Yeah.

1325
02:25:38,808 --> 02:25:42,263
Angela, she keeps

It's not socks

02:25:47,664 --> 02:25:51,477
I don't understand.

1329
02:25:51,477 --> 02:25:53,781
That place is gonna fall
any day now.

1330
02:25:57,871 --> 02:25:59,658
It's Nicky, Steve.

1331
02:26:00,731 --> 02:26:03,590
Nick's alive?

1332
02:26:03,590 --> 02:26:05,378

How do you know?

1335

Hey.

02:26:12,804 --> 02:26:15,862
That place is gonna get caught

02:26:15,862 --> 02:26:19,477
Where's a guy like Nick

1338
02:26:19,477 --> 02:26:22,058
I don't know. Cards, maybe.

02:26:22,058 --> 02:26:24,798
Listen, Steven,
I'm gonna take you home.

1340
02:26:24,798 --> 02:26:27,777
- Aw, shit, Mike. You promised me.

1341
02:26:27,777 --> 02:26:30,319

1342
02:26:30,319 --> 02:26:32,225

I'm sorry. You do

02:27:15,046 --> 02:27:17,032
Coke machine, if anybody wants one.

02:27:17,032 --> 02:27:20,844
Sergeant, we're running late.

02:30:34,339 --> 02:30:36,245
Do you remember me?

1357
02:30:36,245 --> 02:30:39,105
Je comprends pas I'anglais.
Desole. Je dois partir.

1358
02:30:39,105 --> 02:30:42,044
Do you remember Nick?
Remember Nick?

1359
02:30:43,950 --> 02:30:46,135
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

02:30:46,135 --> 02:30:48,041
Really I don't know.

- Hold on a minute, ace.

1363
02:30:54,356 --> 02:30:56,262
Nothing to see anymore here.

1364
02:30:56,262 --> 02:30:58,129
- See that?
- What you want?

1365
02:30:58,129 --> 02:31:00,512
I want a game.

1366
02:31:00,512 --> 02:31:02,339
That's for you.

1367
02:31:04,324 --> 02:31:06,231
It's too dangerous now.

1368
02:31:06,231 --> 02:31:10,043
These time are too dangerous
for this kind of game.

1369
02:31:11,116 --> 02:31:13,578
What do you think?
You think I'm afraid of you?

1370
02:31:15,842 --> 02:31:18,225
I want to play the American.

1371
02:31:18,225 --> 02:31:20,925
I'll match him.
Highest stakes.

1372
02:31:25,572 --> 02:31:28,630
Je crois que je suis aussi
fou que toi.

1373
02:31:28,630 --> 02:31:30,537
Okay.

1374
02:31:31,966 --> 02:31:34,349
How do I know
you know where he is?

1375
02:31:34,349 --> 02:31:37,487
Because I know, that's all.

1376
02:31:37,487 --> 02:31:40,029
But I have to take you
by the river.

1377
02:31:52,698 --> 02:31:55,836
Only because I feel comfortable
with a white suit.

1378
02:32:52,788 --> 02:32:55,290
On arrive.
Here we are.

1379
02:32:55,290 --> 02:32:57,633
You like change your mind?
Still time.

1380
02:32:57,633 --> 02:33:00,413
Qu'est-ce qu'on est
a foutre dans cette galere.

1381
02:33:11,732 --> 02:33:14,234
Allez. Venons en vitesse.

1382
02:33:16,021 --> 02:33:17,928
Oh! Tu viens, oui!

1383
02:33:17,928 --> 02:33:20,112
Qu'est-ce que tu attends?
Come on!

1384
02:33:31,749 --> 02:33:34,489
Wait here.

1385
02:33:55,737 --> 02:33:57,643
He say we have to pay
for go inside.

1386
02:33:57,643 --> 02:33:59,470
- How much?
- One thousand dollar.

1387
02:34:00,503 --> 02:34:02,767
Tell him I'm coming up.

1388
02:34:34,023 --> 02:34:36,604
He say, "Yes,
the famous American is inside."

1389
02:34:36,604 --> 02:34:39,424
You have to give him $500 more
for this information.

1390
02:34:39,424 --> 02:34:41,251
Foireux.

1391
02:34:46,573 --> 02:34:49,234
Il me fait chier de voir
des cons comme ca.

1392
02:34:49,234 --> 02:34:52,491
Les conneries continuent.
Bon, qu'est-ce que je fous ici?

1393
02:34:52,491 --> 02:34:55,430
C'est pas possible.

1394
02:34:55,430 --> 02:34:57,455
Allez! Allez!

1395
02:36:17,125 --> 02:36:19,031
- Where's Nick?
- I don't know.

1396
02:36:19,031 --> 02:36:20,938
What do you mean, you don't--
Where is he?

1397
02:36:20,938 --> 02:36:22,764
I have to go ask the boss.

1398
02:36:33,130 --> 02:36:35,791
Hey! Nick.

1399
02:36:35,791 --> 02:36:38,373
You all right?
Nick, it's me.

1400
02:36:38,373 --> 02:36:40,478
Nick.

1401
02:36:40,478 --> 02:36:42,384
Hey, hey.

1402
02:36:42,384 --> 02:36:44,290
What are you doing?

1403
02:36:44,290 --> 02:36:46,197
What are you--
What are you doing?

1404
02:36:46,197 --> 02:36:48,460
Nick, what are you doing?
Nicolas.

1405
02:36:48,460 --> 02:36:51,121
What's the matter?
Get over there. Get over there.

1406
02:36:51,121 --> 02:36:53,028
Come on.

1407
02:36:53,028 --> 02:36:56,165
You know it's me?
It's Mike.

1408
02:36:56,165 --> 02:36:58,866
- Tell me it's Mike. Tell me it's Mike.
- It's Mike.

1409
02:36:58,866 --> 02:37:00,772
- Tell me it's Mike.
- It's Mike.

1410
02:37:00,772 --> 02:37:03,592
- Mike. Mike who? Mike who?
- Hey.

1411
02:37:03,592 --> 02:37:05,896
- Mike who?
- Mike who? I don't know.

1412
02:37:11,496 --> 02:37:15,149
Nicolas, I came 12,000 miles
back here to get you.

1413
02:37:15,149 --> 02:37:17,215
Don't do that to me.
I'll fuckin'--

1414
02:37:17,215 --> 02:37:19,240
Don't do it.
Don't do it.

1415
02:37:19,240 --> 02:37:21,146
Don't do it.
What's the matter with you?

1416
02:37:21,146 --> 02:37:25,714
Don't you recognize me?
Huh?

1417
02:37:28,176 --> 02:37:31,512
Nicky, I love you. You're my friend.
What are you doing?

1418
02:37:42,672 --> 02:37:45,810
Don't you fucking do this to me,
you fucking--

1419
02:37:48,550 --> 02:37:50,536
Did you hear what I said?

1420
02:37:50,536 --> 02:37:53,038
Get me in the fuckin' game.

1421
02:37:58,757 --> 02:38:01,895
Salut.
J'ai un ami americain la.

1422
02:38:01,895 --> 02:38:04,556
Il voudrait rencontrer ton joueur.

1423
02:38:04,556 --> 02:38:07,892
Il est tres courageux.
Il a deja joue dans le temps. D'accord?

1424
02:38:10,831 --> 02:38:12,737
How much?

1425
02:38:12,737 --> 02:38:14,921
How much?
Here's how much.

1426
02:38:21,395 --> 02:38:23,301
Here, you count it.

1427
02:38:23,301 --> 02:38:25,128
Compte, ca suffit?

1428
02:38:33,111 --> 02:38:35,415
Why not?
Why not?

1429
02:38:35,415 --> 02:38:37,480
Attends. Avec ca en plus, ca va?

1430
02:38:37,480 --> 02:38:39,386
I don't want this money.

1431
02:38:39,386 --> 02:38:41,293
You don't want the money?
Here. Take it.

1432
02:38:41,293 --> 02:38:43,199
Take that too.
Tell him. Go ahead.

1433
02:38:43,199 --> 02:38:45,224
Et avec ca, ca suffit?

1434
02:39:35,049 --> 02:39:38,584
We don't have much time.
We don't have much time, Nick.

1435
02:40:04,002 --> 02:40:05,829
Don't do it.

1436
02:40:18,856 --> 02:40:20,683
What are you--

1437
02:40:42,963 --> 02:40:48,007
Is this what you want?

1438
02:40:57,419 --> 02:40:59,802
I love you, Nick.

1439
02:41:12,392 --> 02:41:14,179
Don't do it.

1440
02:41:32,568 --> 02:41:35,507
Come on, Nicky.
Come home.

1441
02:41:35,507 --> 02:41:37,612
Just come home. Home.

1442
02:41:40,392 --> 02:41:42,457
Talk to me.

1443
02:41:42,457 --> 02:41:46,270
Nicolas, talk to me.

1444
02:41:49,407 --> 02:41:51,909
Nicky. Nicky.

1445
02:41:51,909 --> 02:41:55,523
Wait a minute, Nick.
What did you do to your arms?

1446
02:41:55,523 --> 02:41:59,336
Nicky, do you remember
all the different ways of the trees?

1447
02:41:59,336 --> 02:42:02,275
Do you remember? Huh?

1448
02:42:02,275 --> 02:42:04,936
- The mountains? You remember all that?
- Yeah.

1449
02:42:04,936 --> 02:42:08,352
- One shot.
- One shot. One shot.

1450
02:42:10,933 --> 02:42:12,959
- Hey.
- Yeah.

1451
02:42:17,208 --> 02:42:20,068
Nicky! Nick! Nick!

1452
02:42:20,068 --> 02:42:23,801
Oh! Nicky! Nick!

1453
02:42:23,801 --> 02:42:27,336
Nicky! Nick!

1454
02:42:27,336 --> 02:42:29,242
Nicky! Nicky!

1455
02:42:29,242 --> 02:42:32,380
Don't! Nick! No!

1456
02:42:32,380 --> 02:42:35,994
No! No!
Nicky, you can't!

1457
02:42:46,280 --> 02:42:48,186
This seems to be
the last chapter...

1458
02:42:48,186 --> 02:42:50,927
in the history of American involvement
in Vietnam.

1459
02:42:50,927 --> 02:42:53,508
It's also been the largest
single movement of people...

1460
02:42:53,508 --> 02:42:56,169
in the history
of America itself.

1461
02:42:56,169 --> 02:42:58,473
Hillary Brown, ABC News,

1462
02:42:58,473 --> 02:43:01,213
aboard the attack aircraft carrier
USS Hancock,

1463
02:43:01,213 --> 02:43:03,993
in the South China Sea.

1464
02:44:18,460 --> 02:44:23,027
"May his soul dwell"

1465
02:44:23,027 --> 02:44:25,212
"Among the"

1466
02:44:25,212 --> 02:44:34,267
"Righteous"

1467
02:44:34,267 --> 02:44:37,206
Mommy!

1468
02:45:24,486 --> 02:45:26,392
I'll get these tables.

1469
02:45:34,018 --> 02:45:35,924
Axel, bring those two tables over here.

1470
02:45:35,924 --> 02:45:38,188
I-I'll get it.

1471
02:45:38,188 --> 02:45:41,802
Everybody make yourself at home.
The coffee's already made.

1472
02:46:34,725 --> 02:46:37,544
- Cups. I'll get the cups.
- I'll help you with that.

1473
02:46:37,544 --> 02:46:39,927
I'll help you too, John.

1474
02:46:58,117 --> 02:47:01,572
Oh, hey, there's too many cups.

1475
02:47:01,572 --> 02:47:03,479
How does everybody
want their eggs?

1476
02:47:03,479 --> 02:47:06,020
How about just scrambled, John?

1477
02:47:07,172 --> 02:47:08,999
Toast! Toast.

1478
02:47:38,270 --> 02:47:40,652
Careful, Linda.
It's hot.

1479
02:47:42,638 --> 02:47:45,577
Hey, Axel, how about some beer ?

1480
02:47:49,827 --> 02:47:52,249
Here, uh--
I'll get started on the eggs.

1481
02:47:52,329 --> 02:47:54,196
- Yeah, I'll help you with the eggs.
- No, Linda, Linda.

1482
02:47:54,235 --> 02:47:58,048
Sit down. Sit down.
Pour the coffee.

1483
02:48:29,026 --> 02:48:31,568
It's been such a gray day.

1484
02:49:10,807 --> 02:49:12,872
* Stand beside her *

1485
02:49:12,912 --> 02:49:16,328
* And guide her *

1486
02:49:34,358 --> 02:49:37,139
* God Bless America *

1487
02:49:44,128 --> 02:49:49,172
* God bless America *

1488
02:49:49,252 --> 02:49:53,462
* Land that I love *

1489
02:49:53,541 --> 02:49:56,281
* Stand beside her *

1490
02:49:56,440 --> 02:49:58,347
* And guide her *

1491
02:49:58,466 --> 02:50:00,293
* Through the night *

1492
02:50:00,372 --> 02:50:04,264
* With the light from above *

1493
02:50:04,344 --> 02:50:07,005
* From the mountains *

1494
02:50:07,084 --> 02:50:09,824
* To the prairies *

1495
02:50:09,904 --> 02:50:12,565
* To the oceans *

1496
02:50:12,605 --> 02:50:15,544
* White with foam *

1497
02:50:15,623 --> 02:50:19,833
* God bless America *

1498
02:50:19,912 --> 02:50:26,148
* My home sweet home *

1499
02:50:26,267 --> 02:50:30,715
* God bless America *

1500
02:50:30,794 --> 02:50:37,030
* My home sweet home **

1501
02:50:45,886 --> 02:50:49,540
- Here's to Nick.
- To Nick.

1502
02:50:49,699 --> 02:50:51,764
To Nick.
