1
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:47,414
[woman] All right,
so just watch his ears, okay?

2
00:00:48,414 --> 00:00:51,519
So... who's he paying
attention to right now?

3
00:00:53,519 --> 00:00:55,421
He's listening to me.
See his ear?

4
00:00:55,421 --> 00:00:59,759
Oh, a little sass!
You see that?

5
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:02,428
He's trying to get out.

6
00:01:02,428 --> 00:01:07,333
All right, when he does that,
I'm just gonna make him
work a little bit harder. Okay?

7
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:10,202
So, I'm keeping him moving.
He disobeyed a little bit.

8
00:01:10,202 --> 00:01:14,507
Keeping him moving.
I'm teaching him that when
he disobeys, he gets work,

9
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:17,677
and when he obeys,
he gets rest.

10
00:01:18,677 --> 00:01:22,648
So, when he obeys
and he's trotting well
and he's listening...

11
00:01:22,648 --> 00:01:24,151
Good, Cody.

12
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:27,253
Turning my back to him,
giving him a break.

13
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,787
And if he's learned
his lesson...

14
00:01:28,787 --> 00:01:30,858
Let's see. Is he gonna come?

15
00:01:32,858 --> 00:01:35,929
-Good boy, Cody.
-So cool.

16
00:01:36,929 --> 00:01:38,831
Good job, sis.

17
00:01:39,831 --> 00:01:42,801
What you wanna do
is you wanna make
your loop big.

18
00:01:42,801 --> 00:01:44,602
And then you wanna hold it
where the ropes go.

19
00:01:44,602 --> 00:01:46,602
You wanna grab it
with this hand.

20
00:01:44,602 --> 00:01:46,906
You gotta be the boss, right?

21
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:48,807
Because the horse always
has to have a leader.

22
00:01:48,807 --> 00:01:50,209
And if you're not
gonna be the leader,

23
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:51,709
then he's gonna be
the leader, okay?

24
00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:53,709
[grunting]

25
00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:53,512
[laughing]

26
00:01:53,512 --> 00:01:55,414
I'm not a steer.
Hold on. Now hold up.

27
00:01:55,414 --> 00:01:59,785
Pull back hard.
Pull back towards your belly.
Come on, yeah, pull it.

28
00:01:59,785 --> 00:02:03,721
There you go. Perfect.
High five.

29
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:05,721
Thank you.

30
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:05,758
Thank you, guys.

31
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:08,294
I'll see you Wednesday, okay?
So good to see you.

32
00:02:09,294 --> 00:02:10,798
[woman] Lee.

33
00:02:12,798 --> 00:02:15,366
I just wanted
to thank you so much.

34
00:02:15,366 --> 00:02:16,702
Bella loves her lessons.

35
00:02:16,702 --> 00:02:19,672
Thank you. You're really
doing amazing, Bella.

36
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:22,841
I can't believe you only
have six months left
of high school.

37
00:02:22,841 --> 00:02:25,212
-Yeah.
-Do you know what you want
 to do when you graduate?

38
00:02:27,212 --> 00:02:28,714
No, not yet.

39
00:02:28,714 --> 00:02:30,650
[horse whinnies]

40
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,486
If I hear one more person
ask me what I wanna do
when I graduate...

41
00:02:35,486 --> 00:02:39,491
It's like I'm being
slowly tortured every day
by the mothers of my students.

42
00:02:39,491 --> 00:02:40,793
You'll figure it out.

43
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:42,761
What if I don't?

44
00:02:42,761 --> 00:02:44,964
You're lucky.
You already know
what you want to do.

45
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:47,432
Why don't you just
go to college
like everyone else?

46
00:02:47,432 --> 00:02:48,734
You didn't.

47
00:02:48,734 --> 00:02:50,970
I know. I'm not like
everyone else.

48
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,375
I wanted to be here,
not in a classroom.

49
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:57,910
You get way better grades
than I ever got.

50
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,611
You can probably go
to any school you want.

51
00:02:59,611 --> 00:03:01,747
Yeah, but I don't want
to waste all that time
and money

52
00:03:01,747 --> 00:03:03,716
if I don't know
what I want to do.

53
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:05,883
Well, there's nothing wrong
with staying here,

54
00:03:05,883 --> 00:03:08,621
training horses
and giving lessons.
The kids love you.

55
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:10,889
Yeah, and I love it.

56
00:03:11,889 --> 00:03:15,328
[sighs] I just want to do
something big. You know?

57
00:03:16,328 --> 00:03:19,497
Something epic
that'll really push me,

58
00:03:19,497 --> 00:03:23,436
that's unique and...

59
00:03:24,436 --> 00:03:25,473
significant.

60
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:29,407
So you want to be
a person of distinction?

61
00:03:29,407 --> 00:03:32,277
[scoffs] Gross.
Now you sound like Dad.

62
00:03:32,277 --> 00:03:34,812
I used to get so sick
of hearing that growing up.

63
00:03:34,812 --> 00:03:37,782
Well, he doesn't really
say it anymore.

64
00:03:37,782 --> 00:03:39,453
Yeah, I guess
it has been a while.

65
00:03:41,453 --> 00:03:44,323
I just wish I could figure out
what I'm supposed to do.

66
00:03:44,323 --> 00:03:45,557
Hey.

67
00:03:46,557 --> 00:03:47,894
Dreams take time.

68
00:03:48,894 --> 00:03:51,698
Sometimes you find your path
when you least expect it.

69
00:03:52,698 --> 00:03:54,533
That's easy for you to say.

70
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:56,533
[horse blusters]

71
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:56,970
What's that?

72
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,572
Okay. Chief says he's tired
of listening to your problems

73
00:04:00,572 --> 00:04:01,907
and he wants to go run.

74
00:04:01,907 --> 00:04:03,574
Isn't that right,
Chief? Okay!

75
00:04:03,574 --> 00:04:05,678
What's that? What?

76
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:07,479
Oh, okay, I'll make sure
I tell him.

77
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:09,782
Cody's concerned that
you're not gonna be able
to handle

78
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:11,417
losing to
your baby sister again.

79
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,950
[laughs] Again?
That's never gonna happen.

80
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,950
Okay, all right.

81
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,354
Come on. Let's go, Chief.

82
00:04:15,354 --> 00:04:17,088
[laughing] All right.
I'm already winning.

83
00:04:17,088 --> 00:04:20,817
I don't remember
any time you've ever
beaten me. Come on.

84
00:04:45,817 --> 00:04:48,120
[both chuckling]

85
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,689
[panting]

86
00:04:50,689 --> 00:04:52,557
Did you let me win?

87
00:04:52,557 --> 00:04:54,394
No. I would never
do that.

88
00:04:56,394 --> 00:04:57,130
Let's go again.

89
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,130
Well, that was
the warm-up.

90
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,764
Okay.

91
00:04:59,764 --> 00:05:01,399
Oh, you want to actually
race for real?

92
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:03,399
Yeah. [laughing]

93
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:03,740
It's two out of three anyway.

94
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,507
[video game beeps]

95
00:05:09,507 --> 00:05:11,410
Dude, come play.
I can't kill all these
undead things on my own.

96
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,410
In a minute.

97
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,011
[Lee] Hey, Jordan.

98
00:05:13,011 --> 00:05:15,747
Hey, Lee.
Done shoveling you-know-what?

99
00:05:15,747 --> 00:05:17,916
Can I say that
to a Southern belle?

100
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:21,553
I am not a Southern belle.
And there's a lot more
to keeping horses than that.

101
00:05:21,553 --> 00:05:23,788
Casey, how can this guy
be your best friend
for so long

102
00:05:23,788 --> 00:05:25,490
and still be so clueless
about horses?

103
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,625
Oh, he hates horses.
He's scared of 'em.

104
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:32,163
[scoffs] I'm not scared.
They're just all stinky
and scratchy.

105
00:05:32,163 --> 00:05:34,166
How would you know?
You've barely been
around them.

106
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,166
I just know.

107
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:37,168
What, are you
a horse-ist?

108
00:05:37,168 --> 00:05:38,137
A what?

109
00:05:39,137 --> 00:05:40,773
I don't know.
It's my word

110
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:42,774
for someone bigoted
against horses.

111
00:05:42,774 --> 00:05:45,043
[chuckles] Good try.
It's not a word.

112
00:05:45,043 --> 00:05:46,944
Don't mess
with the etymologist.

113
00:05:46,944 --> 00:05:49,781
Oh, okay, well,
impressive vocab, college boy.

114
00:05:49,781 --> 00:05:52,781
But you should probably
just stick to football.

115
00:05:49,781 --> 00:05:52,117
Happy to.

116
00:05:52,117 --> 00:05:54,153
And that whole little
wingback thingy you do.

117
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:56,755
I'm a tailback,
and your brother was a fullback.

118
00:05:56,755 --> 00:05:58,490
Neither of them
start with "wing."

119
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,490
I don't know why
she can't remember that.

120
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,026
Okay, whatever. I...

121
00:06:01,026 --> 00:06:02,627
He just got
a scholarship offer

122
00:06:02,627 --> 00:06:04,764
to play at the best school
in California.

123
00:06:05,764 --> 00:06:07,966
Wait, really?

124
00:06:07,966 --> 00:06:10,067
Jordan, but...

125
00:06:10,067 --> 00:06:12,904
Wait, how does that work?
You're already in college.

126
00:06:12,904 --> 00:06:14,505
D2 transfer.

127
00:06:14,505 --> 00:06:16,108
You're gonna have
to explain that
to a horse girl.

128
00:06:16,108 --> 00:06:19,646
I'm transferring
from a small school
to a big school.

129
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:21,947
That's huge.

130
00:06:22,947 --> 00:06:24,916
You've got the next
two years of your life
figured out.

131
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:28,555
Any beyond that, too.
They got a pretty great
business school.

132
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:30,690
I'm so happy for you.

133
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:33,896
Thanks, Lee.

134
00:06:37,896 --> 00:06:39,601
[sighs]

135
00:06:42,601 --> 00:06:44,168
[Casey] Jubilee!

136
00:06:44,168 --> 00:06:45,637
What?

137
00:06:45,637 --> 00:06:46,175
Jubilee!

138
00:06:51,175 --> 00:06:53,175
Get in here.

139
00:06:51,175 --> 00:06:53,579
I forgot that was
her real name.

140
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,579
Are you ready
to play yet?

141
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,480
What?

142
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,218
I figured it out. We're gonna
ride our horses cross-country.

143
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:00,985
What are you talking about?

144
00:07:00,985 --> 00:07:02,588
You remember those riders

145
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,923
that stayed on our property
when we were kids?

146
00:07:04,923 --> 00:07:07,923
Not really.

147
00:07:04,923 --> 00:07:07,726
That's what they were doing.
It took me a while,

148
00:07:07,726 --> 00:07:10,928
but I found a whole bunch
of routes on the web.

149
00:07:10,928 --> 00:07:12,764
It's gonna take us
about three months.

150
00:07:12,764 --> 00:07:15,733
But as soon as you graduate,
we're gonna jump
on Cody and Chief

151
00:07:15,733 --> 00:07:16,903
and we're gonna ride west...

152
00:07:17,903 --> 00:07:20,242
until I can throw
my lucky horseshoe
into the Pacific.

153
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:25,011
Come on, Lee. It'll be epic.

154
00:07:26,011 --> 00:07:28,146
Y'all have lost it.
I mean, what are you gonna do?

155
00:07:28,146 --> 00:07:30,182
Get on your horse
and ride down the freeway?

156
00:07:30,182 --> 00:07:33,519
No, there's a system of trails,

157
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,821
back roads, and farms
that people have
already trekked.

158
00:07:35,821 --> 00:07:38,821
That's incredible.

159
00:07:35,821 --> 00:07:38,257
[Jordan]
That can't be safe.

160
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:40,259
That's the whole point.
That's the adventure.

161
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,160
-We could run out of water.
-[Lee] Or food.

162
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,663
-[Casey] We could get lost.
-[Lee] Our horses could
 go lame or get sick.

163
00:07:44,663 --> 00:07:47,833
Some days we could ride
for 30 miles and not see
another soul.

164
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,002
I mean,
think about the challenge.

165
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:51,538
This would be the hardest thing
we've ever done.

166
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:55,208
And you'll get time to get away
and think about your future.

167
00:07:56,208 --> 00:08:00,178
Yeah. I love it.
But what will Dad think?

168
00:08:01,178 --> 00:08:03,214
Who cares.
What do you think?

169
00:08:03,214 --> 00:08:05,086
This is about
something big, Lee.

170
00:08:08,086 --> 00:08:09,154
Let's do it.

171
00:08:10,154 --> 00:08:12,154
Let me show you something.

172
00:08:10,154 --> 00:08:12,057
Okay, all right.

173
00:08:12,057 --> 00:08:14,261
I don't get you horse people.
Logan!

174
00:08:16,261 --> 00:08:19,232
Your brother's stuck
in horse land.
Help me kill these ghouls.

175
00:08:20,232 --> 00:08:22,232
They're zombies.

176
00:08:20,232 --> 00:08:22,668
Whatever, just help me win.

177
00:08:23,668 --> 00:08:26,305
All right, see ya, Dad!
Gotta head down
to the group home for a bit.

178
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:29,274
Hey, whoa, was that
that Big Brother thing
you're talking about?

179
00:08:29,274 --> 00:08:30,175
Yeah.

180
00:08:30,175 --> 00:08:31,812
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

181
00:08:34,812 --> 00:08:35,416
I'm proud of you.

182
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:40,217
And, um, just so you know,
your name's written
all over that one over there.

183
00:08:40,217 --> 00:08:42,955
Oh, wow. When do you think
that'll be done?

184
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:45,955
I don't know.
Whenever I finish this one.

185
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:45,657
Thanks, Dad.

186
00:08:45,657 --> 00:08:47,993
Well, no hurry.
I like my old truck.

187
00:08:47,993 --> 00:08:50,993
See ya, Dad.

188
00:08:47,993 --> 00:08:50,836
Yep. Have fun, son.

189
00:08:57,836 --> 00:09:00,009
[music playing on radio]

190
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:05,009
Wha...

191
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:05,979
[tires squeal]

192
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:08,980

194
00:09:56,761 --> 00:09:58,043
[sighs, sniffles]

195
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:13,070
Okay. Come on, buddy.
Let's go.

196
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,760
[cell phone beeps]

197
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,397
[bell rings]

198
00:11:39,397 --> 00:11:42,067
Mint chocolate.
Your favorite.

199
00:11:43,067 --> 00:11:44,870
Thank you, Brooklyn.

200
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,270
See? I know my girl.

201
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,840
You are the best.

202
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,876
You didn't answer
my texts last night.
You all right?

203
00:11:51,876 --> 00:11:55,280
Yeah. I just got
a lot of work to do
on the farm right now.

204
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,280
Sorry. It's keeping me busy.

205
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,884
Hmm.

206
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,884
Yo, Lee.
What's up, Brooklyn?

207
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,153
What's going on, ladies?

208
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:04,255
Hey, so, our band's got
a gig this week at the barn.
Y'all should come.

209
00:12:04,255 --> 00:12:07,091
We're debuting.
We're called Black Eye Culture.
It's gonna be awesome.

210
00:12:07,091 --> 00:12:08,293
Everybody's gonna
be there.

211
00:12:08,293 --> 00:12:09,293
Oh, thanks for the heads up.

212
00:12:08,293 --> 00:12:09,561
Yeah.

213
00:12:09,561 --> 00:12:11,962
And I know that
you don't get out much,

214
00:12:11,962 --> 00:12:13,498
so you should come.

215
00:12:13,498 --> 00:12:16,902
Yeah, I've got a lot
going on right now.
But we'll see.

216
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,937
It'll take your mind
off things.
So I'll text you.

217
00:12:19,937 --> 00:12:21,937
Okay.

218
00:12:19,937 --> 00:12:21,576
Yeah.

219
00:12:24,576 --> 00:12:28,179
He can't handle that you
turned him down last summer.
He's totally still into you.

220
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:31,182
[laughs] No. He flirts like that
with everyone, Brook.

221
00:12:31,182 --> 00:12:33,432
Girl, you cannot be
that clueless.

222
00:12:47,432 --> 00:12:50,335
What are you eating, Logan?

223
00:12:50,335 --> 00:12:52,471
What? That's all there is.

224
00:12:53,471 --> 00:12:56,541
Uh, why don't you just ask Dad
to get more food?

225
00:12:56,541 --> 00:13:00,048
How? I never see him.
He's either at work
or in the garage.

226
00:13:04,048 --> 00:13:05,549
Hey, Dad.

227
00:13:05,549 --> 00:13:06,751
Hey.

228
00:13:07,751 --> 00:13:11,222
Uh, I really need you
to make Logan's lunch
for tomorrow morning.

229
00:13:11,222 --> 00:13:13,357
He's been eating junk
all day.

230
00:13:13,357 --> 00:13:16,230
You know where the wallet is.
Give him some money.

231
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:22,000
No. Dad, I mean I need you
to go get him some food
from the store.

232
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,238
There's barely any left.

233
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:27,341
Fine.

234
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:32,477
Dad, he's still just a kid.

235
00:13:33,477 --> 00:13:35,515
You need to make him a meal
every once in a while.

236
00:13:38,515 --> 00:13:42,386
I have a test tomorrow.
And I have twice the amount
of work to do at the barn.

237
00:13:42,386 --> 00:13:43,655
I can't do it all.

238
00:13:44,655 --> 00:13:48,128
You know what?
Then why don't you
just sell Chief.

239
00:13:50,128 --> 00:13:51,965
What?

240
00:13:53,965 --> 00:13:56,101
Lee, I don't know anything
about this horse stuff.

241
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:59,004
But what I do know
is he'd be a lot less work
if you got rid of him.

242
00:14:00,004 --> 00:14:03,541
[scoffs] You know what?
Why don't you let me
handle the horses

243
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,376
and you work on being
an actual father

244
00:14:05,376 --> 00:14:07,280
and taking care of
your son who needs you.

245
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,167
[door slams]

246
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:30,485
[clicks tongue]

247
00:15:20,485 --> 00:15:22,226
Come on, buddy.

248
00:15:29,226 --> 00:15:30,097
Good boy.

249
00:15:33,097 --> 00:15:36,634
Don't worry. I'm not gonna
let them sell you.

250
00:15:37,634 --> 00:15:38,437
Okay?

251
00:15:40,437 --> 00:15:41,386
[kisses]

252
00:15:55,386 --> 00:15:56,255
[Lee] What are you doing here?

253
00:15:57,255 --> 00:15:58,357
You all right?

254
00:15:59,357 --> 00:16:02,726
Yeah, I'm fine.
Just working out
some of the horses.

255
00:16:02,726 --> 00:16:04,062
What's up?

256
00:16:04,062 --> 00:16:07,802
Just wanted to come by
and see how you
and everyone else was doing.

257
00:16:10,802 --> 00:16:12,669
You guys were kind of like
a family to me

258
00:16:12,669 --> 00:16:15,807
when I didn't have
much family to go home to.

259
00:16:15,807 --> 00:16:18,077
Just wanted to come check in,
see if I can help out
with something.

260
00:16:20,077 --> 00:16:21,645
Don't you have
football stuff to do?

261
00:16:21,645 --> 00:16:24,615
Not now.
Just conditioning.

262
00:16:24,615 --> 00:16:26,583
I can do some of that
here, you know.

263
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:29,553
Throw around some of
those hay cubes,

264
00:16:29,553 --> 00:16:31,456
or whatever you call them.

265
00:16:31,456 --> 00:16:35,360
Uh, I guess
I could use the help.

266
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,464
Uh, maybe just a little,
you know, filling in
for what Casey used to do.

267
00:16:39,464 --> 00:16:41,832
Yeah, 100%.

268
00:16:41,832 --> 00:16:44,436
Maybe you could
come by Saturday,
if you wanted?

269
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:46,304
Yeah. I'm up early
working out anyway.

270
00:16:47,304 --> 00:16:48,240
5:30 a.m.?

271
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,308
Wow. Uh...

272
00:16:51,308 --> 00:16:53,546
I guess I could go to sleep
a little earlier.

273
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:56,714
It would only be
three mornings a week

274
00:16:56,714 --> 00:16:58,716
and maybe Saturday,
if you have the time.

275
00:16:58,716 --> 00:17:00,122
Yeah, consider it done.

276
00:17:04,122 --> 00:17:05,224
Thank you, Jordan.

277
00:17:07,224 --> 00:17:08,194
So much.

278
00:17:10,194 --> 00:17:13,730
Maybe you could use
this time to yourself...

279
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:16,134
just to process everything,
you know?

280
00:17:17,134 --> 00:17:19,369
I know I needed that
when my mom left us.

281
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:21,369
I'm fine, Jordan.

282
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:21,705
All right.

283
00:17:21,705 --> 00:17:25,477
[chuckles] All right.
[sighs]

284
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:26,345
Now, remember,
I'm a city kid.

285
00:17:27,345 --> 00:17:29,547
Don't get your expectations
up too high.

286
00:17:29,547 --> 00:17:31,217
I don't know the first thing
about a barn.

287
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,818
And you know I hate horses.
But I can shovel.

288
00:17:34,818 --> 00:17:37,189
Well, if that's what you like,
I've got plenty of that to do.

289
00:17:38,189 --> 00:17:41,189
Or maybe something cleaner.

290
00:17:38,189 --> 00:17:41,125
[laughs]

291
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,528
I like the idea
of staying clean.

292
00:17:43,528 --> 00:17:45,498
No such thing
when you're with horses.

293
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:48,498
I'll see you Saturday?

294
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:48,866
Yeah.

295
00:17:48,866 --> 00:17:51,436
Bright and way too early.

296
00:17:52,436 --> 00:17:54,669
All right, sounds good.

297
00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:26,896
[sighs]

298
00:18:52,896 --> 00:18:55,532
Dad! Dad!

299
00:18:55,532 --> 00:18:56,002
Yeah! Yeah!

300
00:18:58,002 --> 00:19:00,939
Come on. Breakfast.
I'm making your favorite.
Get up. Let's go.

301
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:03,939
What?

302
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:03,987
Come on. Breakfast.

303
00:19:15,987 --> 00:19:17,325
I'm gonna do
a cross-country ride.

304
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,593
[Logan] Can I go?

305
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:22,828
No.

306
00:19:24,828 --> 00:19:27,699
Jordan said he'd help
just with the chores,

307
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:30,401
so I will have time
to train the horses.

308
00:19:30,401 --> 00:19:33,401
He'll get sick
of that fast.

309
00:19:30,401 --> 00:19:33,438
He hates horses.

310
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:35,707
Well, either way,
I'll still figure it out.

311
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:39,010
So it's just like the time
you built that tree house
in the backyard, right?

312
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:41,010
What are you talking about?

313
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:41,012
You go out in the backyard

314
00:19:42,012 --> 00:19:44,648
to try and build a tree house,
and who ended up fixing it?

315
00:19:44,648 --> 00:19:45,017
Casey.

316
00:19:46,017 --> 00:19:47,519
I was 12.

317
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:50,755
It's not like that.
This is gonna be different, Dad.

318
00:19:50,755 --> 00:19:51,663
Whatever.

319
00:19:59,663 --> 00:20:01,800
I'm doing this, Dad.

320
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,573
[horse whinnies]

321
00:20:42,573 --> 00:20:44,609
Logan, it's time for bed.

322
00:20:45,609 --> 00:20:46,612
Logan?

323
00:20:47,612 --> 00:20:48,746
Good night.

324
00:20:48,746 --> 00:20:50,647
Hey, this is
the first night

325
00:20:50,647 --> 00:20:53,519
I haven't had
to pry you away
from the video games.

326
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:55,355
What, are you sick?

327
00:20:57,355 --> 00:20:59,398
I'm just tired of being
by myself all the time.

328
00:21:08,398 --> 00:21:10,671
I want somebody
to hang out with.

329
00:21:13,671 --> 00:21:15,839
What's gonna happen
when you go?

330
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:18,910
It's just gonna be
for a couple of months.

331
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,112
Dad will be better
by then.

332
00:21:21,112 --> 00:21:22,823
Are you sure?

333
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:33,559
I miss how Mom
used to put me to bed.

334
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:38,468
Remember how she'd tuck in
the covers real tight?

335
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,614
Come on. Let's go.

336
00:21:56,614 --> 00:21:57,450
[laughs]

337
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:00,419
Hey.

338
00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:02,756
Don't worry, okay?

339
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:08,595
I'm here for you.
No matter what.

340
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:11,773
Good night, Logan.

341
00:22:22,773 --> 00:22:24,154
[horse whinnies]

342
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:37,791
Whoa!

343
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:44,194
[Lee] Yeah, I specialize
in physical therapy
using horseback riding.

344
00:22:44,194 --> 00:22:45,029
[woman] I didn't realize
you could.

345
00:22:46,029 --> 00:22:48,532
It really works well
with kids that love
to ride.

346
00:22:48,532 --> 00:22:49,666
This is great.

347
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:51,669
So, I'll teach you
some exercises

348
00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:53,069
that you can do with her.

349
00:22:53,069 --> 00:22:55,940
First make sure her
knee brace is on tight.

350
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:59,743
Okay. Open it up
and pull it snug.

351
00:22:59,743 --> 00:23:01,211
Cool, so you wanna go
for a spin?

352
00:23:01,211 --> 00:23:04,782
All right. I'm gonna
take these reigns from you.

353
00:23:05,782 --> 00:23:07,718
We're just gonna
come on in here.

354
00:23:07,718 --> 00:23:09,894
[chatter continues indistinctly]

355
00:23:16,894 --> 00:23:18,895
Hey, Dad!

356
00:23:18,895 --> 00:23:20,833
Wanna play
some basketball?

357
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,108
Maybe later.

358
00:23:32,108 --> 00:23:34,108
Mr. Grove.

359
00:23:32,108 --> 00:23:34,145
Hey.

360
00:23:35,145 --> 00:23:38,215
Hey, uh, why don't I
take this up to the house,

361
00:23:38,215 --> 00:23:41,818
and you maybe play some
basketball with Logan?

362
00:23:41,818 --> 00:23:43,753
It would mean
a lot to him.

363
00:23:43,753 --> 00:23:45,589
Yeah, yeah, sure.

364
00:23:45,589 --> 00:23:47,124
I bet you're really good
at basketball.

365
00:23:47,124 --> 00:23:48,259
[scoffs]
What makes you say that?

366
00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:53,597
Uh, just because
you grew up around it,
and, uh, I just--

367
00:23:53,597 --> 00:23:55,166
Because I'm black?

368
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:58,569
Well, that,
and you're an athlete.

369
00:23:59,569 --> 00:24:02,240
Well, maybe you should
be careful with
your assumptions.

370
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,609
You might hurt some people.

371
00:24:05,609 --> 00:24:07,011
Yeah, yeah.

372
00:24:08,011 --> 00:24:10,550
Sorry.
Won't happen again.

373
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,152
I'm actually pretty bad
at basketball.

374
00:24:15,152 --> 00:24:17,152
[laughs] Okay.

375
00:24:15,152 --> 00:24:17,788
So he'll probably beat me.

376
00:24:17,788 --> 00:24:19,257
Okay, cool. Thanks.

377
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:22,692
If it gets too bad,
I'll be running
in the house.

378
00:24:22,692 --> 00:24:24,765
[laughs]

379
00:24:27,765 --> 00:24:29,739
Hey, check up,
little man.

380
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:36,739
Whoa!

381
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:36,173
Ooh!

382
00:24:36,173 --> 00:24:37,240
Oh!

383
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,210
Okay, all right,
pressure's on.

384
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:40,913
Money!

385
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:43,314
[grunting]

386
00:24:43,314 --> 00:24:46,284
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
Let's go, baby.

387
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:48,284
Yeah, winner takes all.

388
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:48,654
Next point wins.

389
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:50,788
Oh, take that!

390
00:24:50,788 --> 00:24:52,990
[grunting]

391
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,593
Oh, no!

392
00:24:55,593 --> 00:24:57,193
What you got?
Pressure's on, bro!

393
00:24:57,193 --> 00:24:59,193
Five, four...

394
00:24:57,193 --> 00:24:59,130
You sure about this?

395
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,665
...three, two, one!

396
00:25:01,665 --> 00:25:02,732
Whoo! Ha ha!

397
00:25:02,732 --> 00:25:05,670
Ah! Ah! He makes it!

398
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,670
Whoo! Whoo!

399
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,939
Yeah!

400
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:09,973
Oh, that was awesome!

401
00:25:09,973 --> 00:25:11,041
Yeah!

402
00:25:11,041 --> 00:25:12,209
[sighs]

403
00:25:12,209 --> 00:25:13,877
You're getting good, man.

404
00:25:13,877 --> 00:25:14,877
Thanks.

405
00:25:13,877 --> 00:25:14,982
Yeah.

406
00:25:18,982 --> 00:25:21,818
Hey, have you ever,
uh, seen your sister

407
00:25:21,818 --> 00:25:25,990
like, really sad about
your brother's death?

408
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:29,661
Like... Like,
let out a big, ugly cry.

409
00:25:30,661 --> 00:25:35,835
I don't know. Maybe a little.
I mean, at the funeral.

410
00:25:37,835 --> 00:25:39,703
We just don't hang out
that much.

411
00:25:39,703 --> 00:25:40,306
Ah.

412
00:25:42,306 --> 00:25:44,609
You know,
being sad's okay.

413
00:25:45,609 --> 00:25:47,846
It's how you get
through it.

414
00:25:48,846 --> 00:25:51,249
I had to learn the hard way
after my mom...

415
00:25:52,249 --> 00:25:54,720
left us for some rich guy.

416
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,327
Took years for me
to finally let it all out.

417
00:26:03,327 --> 00:26:05,866
Then I finally wasn't
so mad anymore.

418
00:26:09,866 --> 00:26:13,941
I cried a lot...
about Casey.

419
00:26:16,941 --> 00:26:18,676
That's good.

420
00:26:19,676 --> 00:26:21,679
Your family can learn
from you, little man.

421
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:22,680
[chuckles]

422
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,280
All right,
I got one more in me.

423
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,280
All right. I start.

424
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,652
Yeah.

425
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:28,818
Let's do this.

426
00:26:28,818 --> 00:26:30,089
[panting]

427
00:26:33,089 --> 00:26:34,660
Hello, pretty lady.

428
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,297
Oh, I didn't forget
about you, girl.

429
00:26:40,297 --> 00:26:41,700
[Lee] A granola bar?

430
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,169
Really?
You're spoiling them,
you know.

431
00:26:45,169 --> 00:26:47,304
Just trying to butter
these old ladies up.

432
00:26:47,304 --> 00:26:49,907
-You know I'm a flirt.
-They're boys, you know.

433
00:26:50,907 --> 00:26:52,042
Right.

434
00:26:52,042 --> 00:26:54,178
[scoffs]
I thought you hated horses.

435
00:26:54,178 --> 00:26:56,180
I'm trying to give 'em
a chance.

436
00:26:56,180 --> 00:27:00,886
I don't want to be a horse-ist
since we're all gonna be
in the same work space.

437
00:27:02,886 --> 00:27:05,056
Okay, well,
just no junk food, please.

438
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:06,057
I'm trying to get 'em
trained up.

439
00:27:07,057 --> 00:27:08,894
Sure thing, boss.

440
00:27:10,894 --> 00:27:12,463
Whoa. What's he doing?

441
00:27:13,463 --> 00:27:15,800
That's Chief.
He was Casey's.

442
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,736
I think he likes you.

443
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:20,137
Yeah, I'm still getting used
to these things.

444
00:27:21,137 --> 00:27:22,338
[laughs]
You are scared of them.

445
00:27:22,338 --> 00:27:24,909
Okay, maybe a little bit.

446
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:28,346
But, uh, I'm all done,
so I was gonna take off.

447
00:27:29,346 --> 00:27:32,284
Thanks. You know,
for spending time
with Logan.

448
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:35,352
I haven't seen him smile
like that in days.

449
00:27:35,352 --> 00:27:36,355
Pleasure's all mine.

450
00:27:39,355 --> 00:27:41,827
So, what's all that stuff
on the table?

451
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,328
I'm gonna do
the cross-country ride.

452
00:27:45,328 --> 00:27:47,865
Just after graduation,
like Case and I planned.

453
00:27:47,865 --> 00:27:49,865
Really?

454
00:27:47,865 --> 00:27:49,967
Yeah.

455
00:27:49,967 --> 00:27:52,502
So, how does this work?
You're just gonna get on a horse
and ride off into the sunset?

456
00:27:52,502 --> 00:27:56,106
Well, I mean do you just
put on your wingback helmet
and jump on the field?

457
00:27:56,106 --> 00:27:59,977
[laughs] No. It's tailback.

458
00:27:59,977 --> 00:28:02,846
Well, it's like prepping
for an ultramarathon,

459
00:28:02,846 --> 00:28:06,083
so I'll have to train
three horses: Cody, Chief,
and a packhorse.

460
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:08,221
You have to get them
all ready just in case
one of them gets hurt.

461
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:14,125
Are you really gonna do
all of this by yourself?

462
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:16,093
Well, I mean,
I'll have the horses.

463
00:28:16,093 --> 00:28:19,195
And I'll meet up
with some riders
on the trail, I'm sure.

464
00:28:19,195 --> 00:28:22,365
Oh, that sounds really safe.
Toothless mountain men
coming out of the woods

465
00:28:22,365 --> 00:28:23,834
with guns and stuff.

466
00:28:23,834 --> 00:28:24,039
Oh, shut up.

467
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:31,510
This is my dream.

468
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:35,148
I'm all about dreams.
Talk to me.

469
00:28:38,148 --> 00:28:40,153
I want to prove
I can do something big.

470
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:46,291
To my dad, to Case,
and to myself.

471
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:52,565
I just need to get out
of here for a while
and think about my life.

472
00:28:54,565 --> 00:28:56,970
Figure out my place
in the world.

473
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:01,306
You gotta do it.

474
00:29:02,306 --> 00:29:05,310
Me and Case always talked
about, you know,
dreams aren't easy.

475
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,282
But they're worth
fighting for.

476
00:29:12,282 --> 00:29:13,051
I believe in you, Lee.

477
00:29:15,051 --> 00:29:16,069
I really do.

478
00:29:33,069 --> 00:29:35,239
I'm so sorry.
I don't know what that was.

479
00:29:35,239 --> 00:29:37,340
[chuckles] Uh,
don't worry about it.

480
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,442
I should...
I should probably just go.

481
00:29:39,442 --> 00:29:41,045
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

482
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:42,279
See you Monday?

483
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:43,582
Yeah. Monday.

484
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:46,584
Bright and way too early.

485
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:47,336
Yeah.

486
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:08,038
Pop, when's
that salt coming?

487
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:11,474
It's on the way. [sighs]

488
00:30:11,474 --> 00:30:14,178
When you gonna get me
one of them smart TVs

489
00:30:14,178 --> 00:30:15,247
so I can see
all your touchdowns?

490
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:19,516
[scoffs] Maybe if you'd
stop gambling so much,
you can afford one yourself.

491
00:30:19,516 --> 00:30:21,484
What'd you say, son?

492
00:30:21,484 --> 00:30:24,188
Pop, you know I'm saving
my money for school.

493
00:30:24,188 --> 00:30:25,388
You need to tell
those recruiters

494
00:30:25,388 --> 00:30:28,224
to get you some cash
under the table.

495
00:30:28,224 --> 00:30:29,327
Or a Corvette.

496
00:30:30,327 --> 00:30:32,663
Yeah, you said that
a dozen times.

497
00:30:32,663 --> 00:30:35,132
It's a scholarship, Pop.
They're not gonna pay me.

498
00:30:35,132 --> 00:30:37,902
Look, I'm just trying
to help you get ahead.

499
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:40,637
Don't be too proud
to take some advice
from your old man

500
00:30:40,637 --> 00:30:43,108
who's been there and done that.
You understand, son?

501
00:30:45,108 --> 00:30:46,012
Yes, sir.

502
00:30:49,012 --> 00:30:50,448
[groans]

503
00:30:51,448 --> 00:30:53,584
Pop, when are you gonna
get the faucet fixed?

504
00:30:53,584 --> 00:30:57,422
Can't afford it.
They cut back my hours
at the factory.

505
00:30:58,422 --> 00:31:00,990
But you can afford
Internet poker?

506
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:04,095
Last time
they cut back my hours,
this hustle kept us afloat.

507
00:31:05,095 --> 00:31:07,964
Yeah, well, maybe you
could try, uh, blackjack.

508
00:31:07,964 --> 00:31:10,964
[scoffs, laughs]

509
00:31:07,964 --> 00:31:10,433
Statistically,
the odds are higher.

510
00:31:10,433 --> 00:31:13,171
Statistically.
Blackjack don't take no skill.

511
00:31:14,171 --> 00:31:17,375
Yeah, well,
you been losing more
than you've been winning.

512
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:21,211
You got a great job
with a decent wage.

513
00:31:22,211 --> 00:31:25,211
You need to stop.

514
00:31:22,211 --> 00:31:25,452
You need to stay out
of my business.

515
00:31:28,452 --> 00:31:30,124
[knocks]

516
00:31:34,124 --> 00:31:36,059
Kim. Come on in.

517
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:38,628
Good to see you as usual.
How's school?

518
00:31:38,628 --> 00:31:40,263
It's good, sir. Thanks.

519
00:31:40,263 --> 00:31:42,601
Jordan, Kim stopped by.

520
00:31:44,601 --> 00:31:45,736
Hey.

521
00:31:45,736 --> 00:31:47,570
I, uh...

522
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:49,306
brought you some salt.

523
00:31:49,306 --> 00:31:51,508
Yeah. Sorry to bother you
about that.

524
00:31:51,508 --> 00:31:53,076
It's no problem.

525
00:31:53,076 --> 00:31:56,713
It's not hard to walk 100 feet
down the sidewalk.

526
00:31:56,713 --> 00:31:58,083
Hmm.

527
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,286
What were you doing up
so early the other day?

528
00:32:02,286 --> 00:32:04,387
Been working
at the Grove's farm.

529
00:32:04,387 --> 00:32:06,522
[father] Yeah, that family's
been through it.

530
00:32:06,522 --> 00:32:09,759
Wife gets cancer.
Casey gets--

531
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:10,063
Dad.

532
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:14,298
All Jeff Grove's
radio station money
can't fix that.

533
00:32:14,298 --> 00:32:17,501
Just goes to show:
Tragedy shows
no favorites.

534
00:32:18,501 --> 00:32:20,506
His sister is in my grade.

535
00:32:22,506 --> 00:32:23,675
Were you helping her?

536
00:32:25,675 --> 00:32:27,644
Yeah. A little bit.

537
00:32:27,644 --> 00:32:28,114
Oh.

538
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,651
Well, that's sweet of you.

539
00:32:34,651 --> 00:32:38,190
Uh... thanks for the salt.

540
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:42,161
Anytime. [chuckles]

541
00:32:44,161 --> 00:32:45,161
Bye.

542
00:32:44,161 --> 00:32:45,151
Bye.

543
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:10,154
Gotta get you in shape.
Pay attention to me.

544
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,288
Ah. Get your butt in.

545
00:33:12,288 --> 00:33:13,393
[clicks tongue]

546
00:33:16,393 --> 00:33:17,230
Get up.

547
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:21,567
Good boy.

548
00:33:57,567 --> 00:33:59,477
Good boy.

549
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:08,346
Day one, right?

550
00:34:09,346 --> 00:34:10,550
Yeah.

551
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:16,353
Hey, sorry I'm late.

552
00:34:17,353 --> 00:34:18,588
Don't worry about it.

553
00:34:18,588 --> 00:34:20,724
Uh, so, what do you
want me to do?

554
00:34:20,724 --> 00:34:23,860
Maybe you could get some hay
and get them ready to feed.

555
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,860
Okay, sure.

556
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,896
Okay, thanks.

557
00:34:25,896 --> 00:34:27,896
Yeah.

558
00:34:25,896 --> 00:34:27,565
Okay.

559
00:34:28,565 --> 00:34:31,371
[sighs]
About the other day?

560
00:34:34,371 --> 00:34:35,572
What about it?

561
00:34:36,572 --> 00:34:39,342
[laughs] Uh, the kiss?

562
00:34:39,342 --> 00:34:40,679
Oh, yeah. Uh-huh.

563
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,250
I don't know,
I just wanted to bring it up

564
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,284
so it didn't create
anything weird between us.

565
00:34:48,284 --> 00:34:51,355
Yeah, I could see
how that would, uh,
be kinda weird.

566
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:55,393
I mean, I'm fine. But I just...
Yeah, that would be good.

567
00:34:56,393 --> 00:34:57,529
Uh...

568
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:00,331
I don't even know
what that was.

569
00:35:01,331 --> 00:35:03,166
I don't know.
I mean, I know
you miss your brother.

570
00:35:03,166 --> 00:35:04,668
And maybe
I represent something.

571
00:35:04,668 --> 00:35:07,570
Or maybe you want to be
close to someone you know

572
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:09,409
when you're sad, or...

573
00:35:12,409 --> 00:35:14,878
maybe it was for me.

574
00:35:15,878 --> 00:35:19,351
I'm pretty sure
it was just for you.

575
00:35:22,351 --> 00:35:25,322
Okay, that's good. Uh...

576
00:35:26,322 --> 00:35:29,295
It's all kind of
unexpected, I guess.
[laughs]

577
00:35:32,295 --> 00:35:35,264
All right, well, uh,
what do we do now?

578
00:35:35,264 --> 00:35:37,800
Should I just grab
the hay or...

579
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,804
Yeah, and I guess I will
just wait for a chivalrous
young man like yourself

580
00:35:41,804 --> 00:35:44,875
to one day ask me out
on a date.

581
00:35:44,875 --> 00:35:47,945
Well, I'm not really sure
this chivalrous man
has the means

582
00:35:47,945 --> 00:35:50,813
to impress a fair lady
like yourself.

583
00:35:50,813 --> 00:35:52,949
I think he underestimates her.

584
00:35:52,949 --> 00:35:55,652
She is but a fair country girl
with simple taste.

585
00:35:56,652 --> 00:35:58,690
Well, if that's
the case...

586
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,858
I shall no longer delay,
my fair maiden.

587
00:36:01,858 --> 00:36:05,695
Would you mind
joining me for dinner
in a fortnight's time?

588
00:36:05,695 --> 00:36:08,695
Two weeks from now?

589
00:36:05,695 --> 00:36:08,898
No I just like
the word "fortnight."

590
00:36:08,898 --> 00:36:09,900
Okay.

591
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,869
What about this weekend?

592
00:36:13,869 --> 00:36:15,706
I would be delighted.

593
00:36:16,706 --> 00:36:20,309
Jordan Bishop.
What is going on?

594
00:36:20,309 --> 00:36:22,311
When did this happen,
and why did I not know
about this?

595
00:36:22,311 --> 00:36:24,347
Okay, it literally came
out of nowhere.

596
00:36:24,347 --> 00:36:27,018
And he's just so smart
and solid and sweet...

597
00:36:28,018 --> 00:36:29,686
And in college!

598
00:36:29,686 --> 00:36:31,355
Yeah. Isn't that weird?

599
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:32,023
He works the front desk
at my gym.

600
00:36:33,023 --> 00:36:34,291
Yeah, weekends.

601
00:36:34,291 --> 00:36:35,992
And he's...

602
00:36:35,992 --> 00:36:37,992
African-American?

603
00:36:35,992 --> 00:36:37,860
Yes.

604
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:40,630
Oh, really?
I had no idea.

605
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:44,670
This is blowing my mind.
I gotta sit down.

606
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:49,972
Morgan isn't going
to be happy.

607
00:36:49,972 --> 00:36:52,478
[Lee] Please.
Morgan couldn't care less.

608
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:58,047
Are you sure you're ready
for the racial drama?
I had a friend--

609
00:36:58,047 --> 00:37:01,050
It'll be fine.
It's not like we're
in the 1960s.

610
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:02,918
We've had
a black president.

611
00:37:02,918 --> 00:37:05,054
Everyone is all progressive
and everything now.

612
00:37:05,054 --> 00:37:06,625
Okay, whatever.

613
00:37:08,625 --> 00:37:11,529
So, when is he
taking you out?

614
00:37:12,529 --> 00:37:13,409
Friday night.

615
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,376
Wow.

616
00:37:27,376 --> 00:37:28,813
[laughs]

617
00:37:29,813 --> 00:37:31,847
Well, you look
very dapper yourself.

618
00:37:31,847 --> 00:37:33,351
[chuckles] Thank you.

619
00:37:34,351 --> 00:37:36,521
Join me for an evening stroll,
my lady?

620
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:39,956
Are you gonna tell me
why I wasn't allowed
in the barn all afternoon?

621
00:37:39,956 --> 00:37:42,434
Ah, patience,
my fair maiden.

622
00:37:51,434 --> 00:37:53,603
We got the only reservation
in town.

623
00:37:54,603 --> 00:37:55,007
[chuckles]

624
00:37:57,007 --> 00:38:00,077
[laughs] You might want
to wait until
you taste the food.

625
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:01,077
[laughs]

626
00:38:01,077 --> 00:38:02,012
So, he plays football
and cooks.

627
00:38:03,012 --> 00:38:07,717
[laughs] Well, I guess
you pick up a few things

628
00:38:07,717 --> 00:38:09,456
when you grow up
without a mom.

629
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,458
My dad never saw you do
any of this?

630
00:38:15,458 --> 00:38:16,427
Nope.

631
00:38:17,427 --> 00:38:19,429
Why doesn't he ever
come down here?

632
00:38:20,429 --> 00:38:22,465
He bought this whole place
for my mom.

633
00:38:22,465 --> 00:38:24,067
I think the horses
remind him of her,

634
00:38:24,067 --> 00:38:27,972
so he hasn't come
down to the barn
since she died.

635
00:38:29,972 --> 00:38:32,809
Well, it could be worse,
given what he's been through.

636
00:38:33,809 --> 00:38:35,809
He's a good man.

637
00:38:33,809 --> 00:38:35,878
Yeah.

638
00:38:35,878 --> 00:38:38,117
You just don't see it
too much these days.

639
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:43,489
I remember all his speeches
about being a man
of distinction.

640
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:48,125
They were kinda cheesy,
but it worked.

641
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:50,827
It got me thinking. You know?
It made a difference.

642
00:38:50,827 --> 00:38:54,463
Really? Well,
then you need to tell me:

643
00:38:54,463 --> 00:38:56,934
What are your plans to be
a man of distinction?

644
00:38:57,934 --> 00:39:00,570
Well, I start at a new college
in six months.

645
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:03,840
I'll be there for two years,
finish my undergrad in business.

646
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,510
Then, Lord willing,
I'll go to the pros.

647
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:11,148
But the average career
only lasts 3.3 years,
statistically speaking.

648
00:39:12,148 --> 00:39:14,483
Wow, you must love
statistics.

649
00:39:14,483 --> 00:39:16,585
[chuckles]
Numbers are everything.

650
00:39:16,585 --> 00:39:19,088
After my 3.3 years,
I'll save that money

651
00:39:19,088 --> 00:39:21,657
and go back and get my MBA.
Avoid debt.

652
00:39:21,657 --> 00:39:24,960
Probably get an executive job,
work my way up
the corporate ladder

653
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,898
to some executive suite.
[laughs]

654
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:29,932
Very impressive.

655
00:39:29,932 --> 00:39:31,204
So, where did
all that come from?

656
00:39:34,204 --> 00:39:36,041
All my pop ever wanted to do
was gamble.

657
00:39:38,041 --> 00:39:39,110
I don't want to be like that.

658
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:43,815
Gonna be the first person
in my family to earn a degree.

659
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:46,949
Only 56% of students finish.

660
00:39:46,949 --> 00:39:48,952
Statistically speaking?

661
00:39:48,952 --> 00:39:50,219
Exactly. [laughs]

662
00:39:50,219 --> 00:39:54,630
Well, a toast.
To big dreams.

663
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:05,635
As a dreamer,
somebody who's always
looking to the future,

664
00:40:05,635 --> 00:40:08,237
it's kind of hard
to ignore the fact
that you're leaving in May

665
00:40:08,237 --> 00:40:10,106
and I'm leaving
in August, right?

666
00:40:11,106 --> 00:40:12,510
It's only our first date.

667
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:16,146
True. [laughs]

668
00:40:17,146 --> 00:40:19,949
Uh, are you hungry
for dessert?

669
00:40:19,949 --> 00:40:21,952
Always.

670
00:40:21,952 --> 00:40:23,519
Well, we're gonna have
to go to the store

671
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:25,755
because I might have given
all the ice cream

672
00:40:25,755 --> 00:40:26,190
to Cody and Chief.

673
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:30,867
-You didn't.
-[laughs]

674
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:39,003
Hey, I'll be right in.
I just gotta respond
to Brook.

675
00:40:40,003 --> 00:40:41,938
Something with
mint chocolate?

676
00:40:41,938 --> 00:40:43,034
Of course.

677
00:41:11,034 --> 00:41:13,637
-[door opens]
-[bell dings]

678
00:41:14,637 --> 00:41:15,072
[door closes]

679
00:41:17,072 --> 00:41:18,309
Hey, did you get it?

680
00:41:20,309 --> 00:41:21,311
What's up?

681
00:41:21,311 --> 00:41:23,916
The store owner
is following me.

682
00:41:26,916 --> 00:41:28,052
No, he's just checking
inventory.

683
00:41:29,052 --> 00:41:31,954
Stay here. Watch this.

684
00:41:31,954 --> 00:41:33,871
Okay.

685
00:41:47,871 --> 00:41:49,873
Oh, my gosh.
You're totally right.

686
00:41:50,873 --> 00:41:52,275
What's his problem?

687
00:41:52,275 --> 00:41:53,943
It happens all the time.

688
00:41:53,943 --> 00:41:56,347
Look, don't worry about it.
Don't let it ruin our date.

689
00:41:57,347 --> 00:41:59,050
No. We have
to do something.

690
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:02,818
Come on.

691
00:42:02,818 --> 00:42:04,688
Okay. If you want to.

692
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:05,190
Let's go.

693
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:11,094
Hey, sir,
were you following me
because I'm a male?

694
00:42:11,094 --> 00:42:13,094
Uh, I'm not--

695
00:42:11,094 --> 00:42:13,096
Let me give you a tip.

696
00:42:13,096 --> 00:42:14,597
So, I attend
the local college

697
00:42:14,597 --> 00:42:16,266
where I'm taking
Sociology 210.

698
00:42:16,266 --> 00:42:18,668
And there I'm learning
that women are more likely

699
00:42:18,668 --> 00:42:20,302
to engage in retail theft
than men.

700
00:42:20,302 --> 00:42:21,371
Statistically speaking.

701
00:42:22,371 --> 00:42:25,742
I didn't mention any stats,
but it's at 4% and rising.

702
00:42:25,742 --> 00:42:27,210
Really? That much.

703
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:29,244
Yeah. Read it in
a scientific journal.

704
00:42:29,244 --> 00:42:30,614
Wow, that's fascinating.

705
00:42:31,614 --> 00:42:36,119
I thought so myself.
So you should probably
follow her next time.

706
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:37,755
Probably so.

707
00:42:38,755 --> 00:42:42,226
Now, I would love
to purchase these items.

708
00:42:43,226 --> 00:42:45,226
You can take them.
I don't--

709
00:42:43,226 --> 00:42:45,894
No. I want to pay.

710
00:42:45,894 --> 00:42:48,099
Like everybody else.
I don't need any
special treatment.

711
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:52,170
Okay. All right.
I'll ring them up for you
behind the counter.

00:52:00,349 --> 00:52:03,351
[scoffs] So now I'm your driver
and your cook?

866
00:52:03,351 --> 00:52:05,922
Yeah. You're the best.

867
00:52:05,922 --> 00:52:07,856
Uh-huh. All right,
you're just saying that

868
00:52:07,856 --> 00:52:10,306
because you want me to do
your science fair project
for you.

869
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:25,875
[Jordan] I can't believe
I finally did that.

870
00:52:25,875 --> 00:52:26,710
[laughs]

871
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:31,746
Dad. What are you
doing out here?

872
00:52:31,746 --> 00:52:33,782
[Jordan]
What's up, Mr. Grove?

873
00:52:33,782 --> 00:52:35,590
[sighs deeply]

874
00:52:41,590 --> 00:52:43,858
-Oh.
-Dad.

875
00:52:43,858 --> 00:52:45,927
That's amazing.

876
00:52:45,927 --> 00:52:47,663
[Jordan] That thing
looks brand new.

877
00:52:47,663 --> 00:52:50,501
Well, then why don't
you two take her out
for a spin tonight?

878
00:52:52,501 --> 00:52:53,702
No. That's okay.

879
00:52:53,702 --> 00:52:55,271
Why not? Cars are
meant to be driven.

880
00:52:56,271 --> 00:52:59,775
Go. Go ahead.
You were gonna go
to co-op for me anyway.

881
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:01,010
You... You're not gonna
come with me?

882
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:05,313
No. I've got
so much training to do
and I'm so behind.

883
00:53:05,313 --> 00:53:07,617
But you should go
and have fun.

884
00:53:08,617 --> 00:53:09,753
You sure, Mr. Grove?

885
00:53:11,753 --> 00:53:13,324
This car was supposed
to be for Casey.

886
00:53:16,324 --> 00:53:18,369
I'm sure he'd want you
to drive it first.

887
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:29,605
Hey. Just go drive
the doggone thing.

888
00:54:02,605 --> 00:54:04,739
Hey, do you want
a granola bar?

889
00:54:04,739 --> 00:54:08,612
Right? I know I'm a sucker.
I know. Don't tell Jordan.

890
00:54:09,612 --> 00:54:10,327
[softly] Don't tell him.

891
00:54:24,327 --> 00:54:25,606
[bell tinkles]

892
00:54:38,606 --> 00:54:39,809
Hey.

893
00:54:40,809 --> 00:54:41,844
You work here?

894
00:54:42,844 --> 00:54:44,447
For about the last two months.

895
00:54:45,447 --> 00:54:46,748
Can I help you?

896
00:54:46,748 --> 00:54:48,918
Nah, I'm just looking.

897
00:54:48,918 --> 00:54:52,588
Are you sure?
You been looking at those.

898
00:54:53,588 --> 00:54:54,856
They're pretty cool.

899
00:54:54,856 --> 00:54:57,661
Especially for someone
who likes horses.

900
00:54:58,661 --> 00:55:01,998
[scoffs]
Yeah, I can see that.

901
00:55:03,998 --> 00:55:05,168
I...

902
00:55:06,168 --> 00:55:08,003
I wonder if someone like that
would really understand

903
00:55:09,003 --> 00:55:12,911
what you've been through
as a black man.

904
00:55:15,911 --> 00:55:17,813
Should I ask someone else
to help me or...

905
00:55:18,813 --> 00:55:24,059
No, I just like
to educate my customers
on their purchases.

906
00:55:30,059 --> 00:55:33,074
-Can I take a look
 at that one?
-Yeah.

907
00:55:46,074 --> 00:55:47,577
Morgan.

908
00:55:48,577 --> 00:55:51,112
Well, I guess you give a brother
a scholarship to a D1 school

909
00:55:51,112 --> 00:55:53,581
and they just give him
anything he wants now, huh?

910
00:55:53,581 --> 00:55:56,885
Classic Benz. It's nice.

911
00:55:56,885 --> 00:55:59,954
-Yeah, let's not lean
 on the car.
-Sure, man. You know what?

912
00:55:59,954 --> 00:56:01,923
Let me get the smudge off
for you real quick.

913
00:56:01,923 --> 00:56:03,659
Hey, man. I'm serious.
Back away from the car.

914
00:56:03,659 --> 00:56:06,429
What? You're not gonna offer
your boys a ride?

915
00:56:07,429 --> 00:56:09,965
In this really, really...
What do they call it
in your neighborhood?

916
00:56:09,965 --> 00:56:11,534
Swag, right?

917
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:14,471
We'd love to see how
a swag car this good drives.

918
00:56:15,471 --> 00:56:16,572
Not now. I'm late.

919
00:56:16,572 --> 00:56:18,844
What you rushing off for?
Got a date with Lee tonight?

920
00:56:21,844 --> 00:56:23,144
You know, what does
she see in you?

921
00:56:23,144 --> 00:56:24,713
Morgan, I'm serious. Move.

922
00:56:25,713 --> 00:56:28,083
You want to know why
you got the better
scholarship?

923
00:56:29,083 --> 00:56:31,820
Affirmative action.
Yeah, that's right.

924
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:33,655
I had similar numbers
to you this year.

925
00:56:33,655 --> 00:56:36,826
That's the only reason
why you're ever
gonna get anything.

926
00:56:36,826 --> 00:56:40,599
That's funny.
I would've thought it was
because you were no good.

927
00:56:44,599 --> 00:56:46,869
[grunting]

928
00:56:47,869 --> 00:56:49,505
-[thuds]
-[cracks]

929
00:56:49,505 --> 00:56:50,608
[groans]

930
00:56:53,608 --> 00:56:55,244
Dude, dude,
we gotta go!

931
00:56:55,244 --> 00:56:56,818
Dude! Dude!

932
00:57:03,818 --> 00:57:05,527
[cell phone ringing]

933
00:57:12,527 --> 00:57:15,273
Dad? What? I'm right
in the middle of something.

934
00:57:25,273 --> 00:57:28,277
My son was just
looking at that car
when that thug attacked him.

935
00:57:28,277 --> 00:57:30,612
Dad, it's just
a fractured wrist.
It's really nothing.

936
00:57:30,612 --> 00:57:32,983
[father]
It could've been
your throwing arm.

937
00:57:33,983 --> 00:57:36,518
Hi. What room
is Jordan Bishop in?

938
00:57:36,518 --> 00:57:38,518
[nurse] 240.

939
00:57:36,518 --> 00:57:38,853
240. Thank you.

940
00:57:38,853 --> 00:57:40,931
[machine beeping]

941
00:57:48,931 --> 00:57:51,534
[sniffles, sighs]

942
00:57:51,534 --> 00:57:52,909
I'm here, Jordan.

943
00:57:59,909 --> 00:58:01,777
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

944
00:58:02,777 --> 00:58:04,847
Let's just give her
a little time alone, okay?

945
00:58:04,847 --> 00:58:06,782
[Logan] Is he gonna be
all right?

946
00:58:06,782 --> 00:58:09,327
I don't know.
Let's go see if we can
get some answers. Come on.

947
00:58:19,327 --> 00:58:21,331
[groans]

948
00:58:23,331 --> 00:58:24,266
Nurse?

949
00:58:25,266 --> 00:58:27,266
Nurse! He's waking up.

950
00:58:25,266 --> 00:58:27,702
[groans]

951
00:58:27,702 --> 00:58:29,639
Are you okay?

952
00:58:30,639 --> 00:58:32,041
What happened?

953
00:58:32,041 --> 00:58:33,108
Let's see.

954
00:58:33,108 --> 00:58:34,043
Oh, my head.

955
00:58:35,043 --> 00:58:38,813
Hey. Yeah, I just wanna
let you know he, uh...

956
00:58:38,813 --> 00:58:40,849
he has a concussion.

957
00:58:40,849 --> 00:58:43,152
But, um, something's
going on with his knee.
I'm not exactly sure what.

958
00:58:43,152 --> 00:58:45,253
Excuse me, Mr. Grove?

959
00:58:45,253 --> 00:58:47,724
Hey, Thomas, let me
call you right back.

960
00:58:48,724 --> 00:58:50,893
Hi, Officer.

961
00:58:50,893 --> 00:58:52,760
Mr. Wallace,
the other boy's father,

962
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:55,132
said you may be wanting to file
a grand theft auto charge?

963
00:58:57,132 --> 00:58:58,467
What are you talking about?

964
00:58:59,467 --> 00:59:01,904
Well, your Mercedes
was at the scene,
and the suspect--

965
00:59:01,904 --> 00:59:03,239
Are you talking about...

966
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:05,240
Are you talking
about Jordan Bishop?

967
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:09,110
Yes, Mr. Bishop
was driving it.

968
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:10,646
Mr. Bishop
was driving the car

969
00:59:10,646 --> 00:59:13,384
because I gave Mr. Bishop
the keys.

970
00:59:15,384 --> 00:59:16,018
Officer, do you have
anything else?

971
00:59:17,018 --> 00:59:18,353
If not, I'd like to call
the boy's father.

972
00:59:18,353 --> 00:59:20,989
No, Mr. Grove.
I was just following up

973
00:59:20,989 --> 00:59:22,824
for Mr. Wallace's information.
That's all.

974
00:59:22,824 --> 00:59:24,094
Thank you.
Have a good day.

975
00:59:25,094 --> 00:59:26,965
[sighs] Good night.

976
00:59:30,965 --> 00:59:32,670
Hey, Thomas.
Sorry about that.

977
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:35,710
[sighs]

978
00:59:41,710 --> 00:59:43,847
[clears throat]
How is he?

979
00:59:44,847 --> 00:59:47,750
He's good.
The doctors just finished
checking him over.

980
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:49,186
So he's sleeping.

981
00:59:51,186 --> 00:59:53,186
Is his dad coming?

982
00:59:51,186 --> 00:59:53,023
He's working
the double shift.

983
00:59:54,023 --> 00:59:56,393
He's gonna come
in the morning.
We should stay with him.

984
00:59:57,393 --> 00:59:59,161
Where's, uh...
Where's Logan?

985
00:59:59,161 --> 00:59:59,456
Uh, he crashed
in Jordan's room.

986
01:00:01,295 --> 01:00:03,295
I'm gonna go grab a snack.

987
01:00:01,295 --> 01:00:03,737
Okay.

988
01:00:08,737 --> 01:00:12,940
So, um, how are you?

989
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:15,786
Hmm. I've been better.

990
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:28,757
You know, I, uh,
kinda connected the dots.

991
01:00:28,757 --> 01:00:29,994
What do you mean?

992
01:00:31,994 --> 01:00:33,329
Between you and Jordan.

993
01:00:34,329 --> 01:00:36,201
You're obviously
more than friends.

994
01:00:39,201 --> 01:00:41,072
Why would you keep that
a secret from me?

995
01:00:43,072 --> 01:00:44,340
I was gonna tell you.

996
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:47,414
But it's not like
you're ever around.

997
01:00:52,414 --> 01:00:54,884
Besides, I knew
you'd be angry.

998
01:00:55,884 --> 01:00:57,351
[scoffs]

999
01:00:57,351 --> 01:00:59,358
So that's what
you think of me?

1000
01:01:03,358 --> 01:01:05,340
Everybody else seems to have
a problem with it.

1001
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:20,344
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

1002
01:01:22,344 --> 01:01:24,246
I was worried you'd be upset...

1003
01:01:25,246 --> 01:01:29,492
because he was
Casey's best friend.

1004
01:01:36,492 --> 01:01:38,994
Well, one good thing
about your big brother:

1005
01:01:38,994 --> 01:01:43,208
He... He always was
a good judge of character.

1006
01:01:53,208 --> 01:01:57,045
Hey, it's late.
Just go get Logan,

1007
01:01:57,045 --> 01:01:59,414
and maybe Brooklyn
will give you
a ride home. All right?

1008
01:01:59,414 --> 01:02:00,416
Maybe she'll even
stay the night.

1009
01:02:01,416 --> 01:02:03,521
I'll stay here.
He's gonna be fine.

1010
01:02:06,521 --> 01:02:07,922
Okay.

1011
01:02:07,922 --> 01:02:09,123
Get outta here. Go.

1012
01:02:09,123 --> 01:02:10,233
Thanks, Dad.

1013
01:02:19,233 --> 01:02:20,139
Mr. Bishop?

1014
01:02:25,139 --> 01:02:26,275
Here's what we have.

1015
01:02:27,275 --> 01:02:31,346
The MRI shows that you have
a tear in your ACL.

1016
01:02:31,346 --> 01:02:33,114
Now, I don't think
you'll have to have surgery,

1017
01:02:33,114 --> 01:02:38,152
but you're gonna have to undergo
some intensive physical therapy
once the swelling goes down.

1018
01:02:38,152 --> 01:02:41,923
It'll recover in a few months
if you take care of it.

1019
01:02:41,923 --> 01:02:42,025
Okay, good.

1020
01:02:43,025 --> 01:02:47,197
But what I'm most concerned
about is your concussion.

1021
01:02:48,197 --> 01:02:52,067
The CT scan shows
some internal bleeding
and some signs of scar tissue

1022
01:02:52,067 --> 01:02:55,204
which may have been
from a previous concussion.

1023
01:02:55,204 --> 01:02:56,172
Probably from
playing football.

1024
01:02:57,172 --> 01:02:58,076
You don't want to have
more than three.

1025
01:03:01,076 --> 01:03:02,478
So, I can play ball?

1026
01:03:03,478 --> 01:03:05,347
Uh, it's tough to say.

1027
01:03:06,347 --> 01:03:09,518
Worst case,
with a few more bad hits,

1028
01:03:09,518 --> 01:03:11,920
and you could wind up with CTE,

1029
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:16,291
which could lead
to mental breakdowns,

1030
01:03:16,291 --> 01:03:19,463
erratic behavior,
premature dementia.

1031
01:03:22,463 --> 01:03:27,237
The only way I have
of paying for college
is that football scholarship.

1032
01:03:29,237 --> 01:03:31,074
So, what am I
supposed to do, Doc?

1033
01:03:33,074 --> 01:03:36,646
I'm, um... I'm sorry.
I can't answer that.

1034
01:03:37,646 --> 01:03:39,420
Only you can make
that decision.

1035
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:46,030
[sighs]

1036
01:03:55,030 --> 01:03:59,905
Folks come back from torn ACLs.
Happens all the time.

1037
01:04:02,905 --> 01:04:06,041
My knee is gonna heal.
It's my head
I'm worried about.

1038
01:04:06,041 --> 01:04:08,911
Oh, them doctors don't know
what they're talking about.

1039
01:04:08,911 --> 01:04:11,146
You're a Bishop.
You're built like a brick.

1040
01:04:11,146 --> 01:04:14,516
With some hard work,
you can get back on that field.

1041
01:04:14,516 --> 01:04:17,686
Pop, I love football.
But this isn't about that.

1042
01:04:18,686 --> 01:04:21,557
It's about everything else
I want to accomplish in life.

1043
01:04:23,557 --> 01:04:27,932
-One more blow--
-You can't afford college
 without that scholarship.

1044
01:04:30,932 --> 01:04:32,068
Look, son...

1045
01:04:33,068 --> 01:04:34,304
you're really good.

1046
01:04:35,304 --> 01:04:37,340
You got a chance
to play on Sunday.

1047
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:39,443
And get paid.

1048
01:04:41,443 --> 01:04:43,045
Is it worth me risking
my brain?

1049
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:44,947
No risk, no reward.

1050
01:04:45,947 --> 01:04:49,585
Look, you either man up
and show 'em you still got
what it takes, or...

1051
01:04:51,585 --> 01:04:55,590
well, I can probably
get you some work down
at the factory.

1052
01:04:55,590 --> 01:04:57,458
No, I don't want to work
at the factory.

1053
01:04:57,458 --> 01:04:59,161
You think you're too good
to work at the factory.

1054
01:04:59,161 --> 01:05:01,262
You think you're better
than your old man?

1055
01:05:01,262 --> 01:05:02,601
No, no, no.

1056
01:05:06,601 --> 01:05:08,369
I just got other dreams.

1057
01:05:08,369 --> 01:05:10,137
Yeah, you're a sharp kid.

1058
01:05:10,137 --> 01:05:12,641
In ten years or so,
you could work your way
up to supervisor,

1059
01:05:12,641 --> 01:05:14,077
make a pretty good wage.

1060
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:16,081
Mm-hmm.

1061
01:05:19,081 --> 01:05:21,717
No, I'm gonna
get some loans.
Pay for it myself.

1062
01:05:21,717 --> 01:05:24,119
Nah, nah.
See, that's exactly what
the government wants.

1063
01:05:24,119 --> 01:05:25,619
Get you 150 grand in debt.

1064
01:05:25,619 --> 01:05:28,090
Take you 25 years
of working for the man
to pay it off.

1065
01:05:29,090 --> 01:05:31,460
It's all over TV.
College ain't worth
that kind of debt.

1066
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:33,463
Well, I started it.
I gotta finish it.

1067
01:05:35,463 --> 01:05:40,501
Then you best get back out
on that field and pretend
like nothing happened.

1068
01:05:40,501 --> 01:05:43,197
I would have had the money
if you hadn't gambled
it all away.

1069
01:06:09,197 --> 01:06:10,768

1070

1075
01:07:12,693 --> 01:07:15,364
Hey, babe. How are you?

1076
01:07:17,364 --> 01:07:19,768
I'm glad you're here.
You don't have to stay long.

1077
01:07:19,768 --> 01:07:21,436
I know you got horses
to train.

1078
01:07:22,436 --> 01:07:23,605
There's nowhere
I'd rather be.

1079
01:07:23,605 --> 01:07:26,605
That's my girl.

1080
01:07:23,605 --> 01:07:26,775
[laughs]

1081
01:07:26,775 --> 01:07:29,577
I may have to take
some time off my job
at the farm.

1082
01:07:29,577 --> 01:07:31,545
[chuckles] I will talk
to management

1083
01:07:31,545 --> 01:07:33,481
and see if I can get it
approved, okay?

1084
01:07:33,481 --> 01:07:34,717
[both laugh]

1085
01:07:35,717 --> 01:07:37,621
Oh, hey,
how's your concussion?

1086
01:07:39,621 --> 01:07:42,157
Doctor says it's fine.
Nothing to worry about.

1087
01:07:43,157 --> 01:07:45,260
Good. That could've been
the end of football for you.

1088
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:49,498
I'm just ready to get back
and start rehabbing.

1089
01:07:50,498 --> 01:07:52,835
I think I can get back
by the fall.

1090
01:07:53,835 --> 01:07:55,871
I don't have all the money
I need for PT,

1091
01:07:55,871 --> 01:07:59,675
but maybe I can watch
some videos online or something.

1092
01:08:00,675 --> 01:08:02,711
We'll figure it out.

1093
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:06,215
Can I hire that girl with
the bad knee on the horse?

1094
01:08:07,215 --> 01:08:10,351
Um, I think she's
a little busy with
sixth grade homework.

1095
01:08:10,351 --> 01:08:12,654
But I think
I could do it.

1096
01:08:12,654 --> 01:08:14,889
I mean, I remember
everything that we did.

1097
01:08:14,889 --> 01:08:18,292
No, no. You've done enough.
Your plate's full.

1098
01:08:18,292 --> 01:08:20,729
No. This is your dream.

1099
01:08:21,729 --> 01:08:23,797
Football's
the start of it.

1100
01:08:23,797 --> 01:08:25,399
Look, I can push my trip
back to the fall.

1101
01:08:25,399 --> 01:08:27,399
I'm way behind
in my training as it is.

1102
01:08:25,399 --> 01:08:27,801
No, no.

1103
01:08:27,801 --> 01:08:29,474
No, you're not doing that.

1104
01:08:32,474 --> 01:08:35,645
Your broken dreams
are worth putting
back together.

1105
01:08:37,645 --> 01:08:40,748
Yeah. They are.

1106
01:08:40,748 --> 01:08:43,618
Besides, I gotta get you
back to playing wingman.

1107
01:08:43,618 --> 01:08:45,554
[laughs]

1108
01:08:45,554 --> 01:08:48,554
It's wingback,
you wing nut.

1109
01:08:45,554 --> 01:08:48,493
Okay.

1110
01:08:51,493 --> 01:08:52,493
[chuckles]

1111
01:08:51,493 --> 01:08:52,864
[sighs]

1112
01:08:56,864 --> 01:08:59,501
You know, my dad's
gonna be home soon.

1113
01:08:59,501 --> 01:09:02,671
Um, you might want
to take off.

1114
01:09:03,671 --> 01:09:07,609
I just... I just
don't feel like dealing
with all that today.

1115
01:09:07,609 --> 01:09:08,412
Yeah. I get it.

1116
01:09:11,412 --> 01:09:13,515
But, hey, at least
you're gonna finally
ride a horse.

1117
01:09:14,515 --> 01:09:18,752
I don't know what's worse,
a stinky horse or a bad knee
for the rest of my life.

1118
01:09:18,752 --> 01:09:21,389
[chuckles] Okay,
you are definitely
a horse-ist.

1119
01:09:21,389 --> 01:09:22,457
[laughs]

1120
01:09:22,457 --> 01:09:23,824

You. [laughs]

1124
01:09:30,465 --> 01:09:31,765
I don't know about this.

1125
01:09:31,765 --> 01:09:33,435
Come on.
What's the matter?

1126
01:09:33,435 --> 01:09:34,970
Me falling off.

1127
01:09:35,970 --> 01:09:37,970
Come on. I thought you said
you weren't scared.

1128
01:09:35,970 --> 01:09:37,340
Well, I lied.

1129
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:40,609
All right. Come on.
Just get ready.

1130
01:09:40,609 --> 01:09:41,710
On three, okay?

1131
01:09:41,710 --> 01:09:44,710
All right.

1132

01:09:47,015 --> 01:09:49,018
What are you doing?
Looking for your seat belt?
[laughs]

1135
01:09:50,018 --> 01:09:52,487
Oh, okay.
You got jokes, huh?

1136
01:09:52,487 --> 01:09:54,622
What, are three people
gonna see that on there?

1137
01:09:54,622 --> 01:09:55,560
It's 12.

1138
01:09:58,560 --> 01:09:59,028
[shutter clicks]

1139
01:10:00,028 --> 01:10:03,797
All right.
Don't be afraid, Jordan.
I got you. Come on.

1140
01:10:03,797 --> 01:10:05,797
Whoa.

1141
01:10:03,797 --> 01:10:05,742
Just hold on.

1142
01:10:13,742 --> 01:10:15,042
I don't know about this.

1143
01:10:15,042 --> 01:10:16,578
[Lee] Come on.
It's easy.

1144
01:10:17,578 --> 01:10:19,280
Okay, so, when you ride,

1145
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:21,815
every muscle in your legs
are gonna be worked.

1146
01:10:21,815 --> 01:10:23,019
It's gonna
slowly break through
the scar tissue

1147
01:10:24,019 --> 01:10:25,756
that's limiting
your mobility.

1148
01:10:27,756 --> 01:10:28,024
You sure old Chief
is ready for this?

1149
01:10:29,024 --> 01:10:31,761
Oh, trust me.
He's loving it. I promise.

1150
01:10:32,761 --> 01:10:34,929
All right. Let's go.

1151
01:10:34,929 --> 01:10:37,832
Uh... [chuckles] Okay.

1152
01:10:37,832 --> 01:10:39,735
-Come on.
-Come on.

1153
01:10:41,735 --> 01:10:43,070
I'm a regular
old cowboy now.

1154
01:10:43,070 --> 01:10:45,907
See? Much more fun
than PT.

1155
01:10:45,907 --> 01:10:47,009
Plus, the view
is better.

1156
01:10:48,009 --> 01:10:49,811
The view is outstanding.

1157
01:10:50,811 --> 01:10:52,811
There we go!

01:10:50,811 --> 01:10:52,479

Oh, so, you got you
a white girlfriend now.

1203
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:22,030
I have a girlfriend.
Her name is Lee.

1204
01:13:23,030 --> 01:13:24,865
And I don't care about
the color of her skin.

1205
01:13:24,865 --> 01:13:28,703
Well, I guarantee
she cares about
the color of your skin.

1206
01:13:28,703 --> 01:13:31,739
Trust me. I've been
around this town too long.

1207
01:13:32,739 --> 01:13:34,009
People are talking, Jordan,
about who did this

1208
01:13:35,009 --> 01:13:37,514
and who did what between you
and them white boys.

1209
01:13:39,514 --> 01:13:41,514
Well, Lee's different.

1210
01:13:39,514 --> 01:13:41,916
She's no different.

1211
01:13:41,916 --> 01:13:45,752
You think you're special?
You think she's gonna want
a future with you

1212
01:13:45,752 --> 01:13:48,257
if can't play football,
if you can't afford school?

1213
01:13:50,257 --> 01:13:52,094
You haven't even
told her, have you?

1214
01:13:53,094 --> 01:13:54,929
I didn't think so.

1215
01:13:54,929 --> 01:13:57,899
The second you don't have
some flashy future,
she's gonna drop you.

1216
01:13:57,899 --> 01:14:01,502
You'll see.
She's got money, son.
Ain't nothing wrong with that.

1217
01:14:01,502 --> 01:14:05,773
But she ain't gonna
wanna be with nobody
can't pay for her horses.

1218
01:14:05,773 --> 01:14:08,773
That's just the way it is.

1219
01:14:05,773 --> 01:14:08,510
You don't even know her.

1220
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:10,578
Because you're ashamed
to bring her around
your old man,

1221
01:14:10,578 --> 01:14:12,212
because you figure
if she knows your roots,

1222
01:14:12,212 --> 01:14:14,149
she might not stick around.

1223
01:14:15,149 --> 01:14:18,686
-I'll bring her by, then.
-All right, you do that.

1224
01:14:19,686 --> 01:14:23,686
I'm sure she's a...
she's a nice young lady.

1225
01:14:19,686 --> 01:14:23,157
Yes, she is.

1226
01:14:23,157 --> 01:14:25,029
But she's gonna
break your heart.

1227
01:14:28,029 --> 01:14:29,269
She's not Mom.

1228
01:14:34,269 --> 01:14:36,871
I'm just trying
to look out for you, son.

1229
01:14:36,871 --> 01:14:39,908
You're from
separate worlds.

1230
01:14:39,908 --> 01:14:41,966
Ain't no future
for the two of you.

1231
01:15:05,966 --> 01:15:09,703
Looks like Jordan's all better.
Time to get back to work.

1232
01:15:09,703 --> 01:15:11,268
[cell phone beeps]

1233
01:15:40,268 --> 01:15:42,337
[Lee] See, whenever
you're steering him,

1234
01:15:42,337 --> 01:15:44,204
if you want him
to go this way,

1235
01:15:44,204 --> 01:15:46,341
you want to pull back
towards your hip.

1236
01:15:46,341 --> 01:15:49,243
Just like that.
You never cross over his neck.

1237
01:15:49,243 --> 01:15:51,078
So, bring him around
this way.

1238
01:15:51,078 --> 01:15:52,880
Good. Now loosen up.

1239
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:54,028
[indistinct chatter]

1240
01:16:07,028 --> 01:16:12,220
[male teacher] Historians have
traditionally divided the war
into three phases.

1241
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:34,689
-Hey. You need any help?
-Hey.

1242
01:16:35,689 --> 01:16:37,925
Yeah. Uh, maybe
you could grab a brush.

1243
01:16:37,925 --> 01:16:40,925
I need to get ready
for school pretty soon.

1244
01:16:37,925 --> 01:16:40,332
Yeah.

1245
01:16:44,332 --> 01:16:48,872
[Jordan] Oh, yeah.
You like that, huh, boy?

1246
01:16:50,872 --> 01:16:52,041
You look tired.

1247
01:16:53,041 --> 01:16:55,010
Just what every woman
loves to hear.

1248
01:16:56,010 --> 01:16:58,078
[chuckles]
I just worry about you.

1249
01:16:58,078 --> 01:16:59,783
You know,
you've been pushing hard.

1250
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:04,989
That's what you have to do
to accomplish your dreams.

1251
01:17:08,989 --> 01:17:10,094
How you doing, Chief?

1252
01:17:13,094 --> 01:17:14,434
You miss your buddy,
don't you?

1253
01:17:19,434 --> 01:17:24,738
Hey, Lee, have you ever
really grieved Casey's death?

1254
01:17:24,738 --> 01:17:25,474
Yeah. Of course.

1255
01:17:26,474 --> 01:17:29,476
It just seems like
ever since it all happened,

1256
01:17:29,476 --> 01:17:31,476
you've just been
running ragged, you know?

1257
01:17:29,476 --> 01:17:31,912
I'm fine, Jordan.

1258
01:17:31,912 --> 01:17:34,850
I don't know why you always
keep bringing it up.

1259
01:17:35,850 --> 01:17:38,056
Okay. Never mind.

1260
01:17:43,056 --> 01:17:44,760
Prom's coming up, right?

1261
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:46,461
Guess so.

1262
01:17:46,461 --> 01:17:48,261
Do I, like, have to go to that?

1263
01:17:48,261 --> 01:17:51,432
Or am I too old?
Will they let me in?

1264
01:17:52,432 --> 01:17:55,802
I've never really cared
too much about prom, so...

1265
01:17:55,802 --> 01:17:57,240
Okay, good.

1266
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:02,844
I know it doesn't compare...

1267
01:18:02,844 --> 01:18:05,149
but I was thinking
I could invite you over
for dinner with my father.

1268
01:18:09,149 --> 01:18:11,149
Really?

1269
01:18:09,149 --> 01:18:11,386
Yeah. I think I'm ready.

1270
01:18:12,386 --> 01:18:14,523
I don't know
what'll happen, but...

1271
01:18:15,523 --> 01:18:18,395
I just want him to realize
that we're different.

1272
01:18:21,395 --> 01:18:22,430
I'm sure I'll love him.

1273
01:18:23,430 --> 01:18:26,403
And I can make him
love me.

1274
01:18:29,403 --> 01:18:31,140
Come on, come on.
Keep up, keep up!

1275
01:18:33,140 --> 01:18:35,480
Uh-uh. Careful.

1276
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:41,984
Good boy.

1277
01:18:42,984 --> 01:18:45,421
Easy. Good boy.

1278
01:18:47,421 --> 01:18:49,297
One more time. Come on.

1279
01:18:57,297 --> 01:18:58,533
[sighs]

1280
01:18:59,533 --> 01:19:01,805
[Jeff] Looks like you've been
training those horses hard.

1281
01:19:03,805 --> 01:19:04,876
Yep.

1282
01:19:08,876 --> 01:19:10,378
You still planning
on doing that trip?

1283
01:19:11,378 --> 01:19:13,914
Probably have to delay
a month or so,

1284
01:19:13,914 --> 01:19:16,454
but, yeah, I am.

1285
01:19:21,454 --> 01:19:23,257
You still gonna
ride it alone?

1286
01:19:24,257 --> 01:19:25,363
Sure am.

1287
01:19:30,363 --> 01:19:33,167
You know, you, um...
you actually proved me wrong.

1288
01:19:34,167 --> 01:19:35,869
I thought
you'd lose interest.

1289
01:19:35,869 --> 01:19:37,005
Like you did
when you were a kid
with the tree house.

1290
01:19:38,005 --> 01:19:41,945
But...
you impressed me.

1291
01:19:44,945 --> 01:19:46,948
Thanks, Dad.

1292
01:19:47,948 --> 01:19:50,618
Listen, you know,
I know I haven't been
the best father lately.

1293
01:19:50,618 --> 01:19:52,953
And you can take this
for whatever it's worth.

1294
01:19:52,953 --> 01:19:54,288
But, um...

1295
01:19:55,288 --> 01:19:57,261
I just don't want you
riding cross-country.

1296
01:20:00,261 --> 01:20:04,931
Now, listen.
You're gonna be out there
all by yourself.

1297
01:20:04,931 --> 01:20:08,502
Going across the country,
okay? It's not safe.

1298
01:20:09,502 --> 01:20:12,212
I don't know
if I can handle losing
someone else in my family.

1299
01:20:19,212 --> 01:20:20,997
Can you do that for me?

1300
01:20:35,997 --> 01:20:37,340
[doorbell rings]

1301
01:20:46,340 --> 01:20:47,608
Hey.

1302
01:20:47,608 --> 01:20:50,278
Wow, you look great.
Are you ready for this?

1303
01:20:50,278 --> 01:20:51,283
Yeah. Let's go.

1304
01:20:56,283 --> 01:20:58,253
[both sigh]

1305
01:21:00,253 --> 01:21:01,253
Hey!

1306
01:21:00,253 --> 01:21:01,555
Hey, Pop.

1307
01:21:01,555 --> 01:21:04,555
This is Jubilee.

1308
01:21:01,555 --> 01:21:04,391
[laughing] Hi, Mr. Bishop.

1309
01:21:04,391 --> 01:21:07,328
Wow. You sure have grown up
since the last time
I last saw you,

1310
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:10,297
sitting in the bleachers,
watching your brother
play football.

1311
01:21:10,297 --> 01:21:12,297
Yeah.

1312
01:21:10,297 --> 01:21:12,600
He was a heck of a player.

1313
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:14,635
You guys chat.
I'm gonna check on the food.

1314
01:21:14,635 --> 01:21:17,203
Yeah, I spent a lot of time
sitting in those bleachers.

1315
01:21:17,203 --> 01:21:18,039
Yes, you did. [chuckles]

1316
01:21:19,039 --> 01:21:22,176
Jubilee. Jubilee.
You know, my father
sang gospel

1317
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:23,176
in a jubilee quartet.

1318
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:23,610
Really?

1319
01:21:23,610 --> 01:21:25,712
Mm-hmm. You ever heard of that?
That kind of thing?

1320
01:21:25,712 --> 01:21:27,515
No, I don't think so.
Sorry.

1321
01:21:27,515 --> 01:21:29,182
Ah, no reason you would.

1322
01:21:29,182 --> 01:21:31,319
-[chuckles]
-[knocks]

1323
01:21:31,319 --> 01:21:32,520
Would you get that for me?

1324
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:34,520
Yeah.

1325
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:34,121
Thanks.

1326
01:21:34,121 --> 01:21:35,359
Yeah.

1327
01:21:39,359 --> 01:21:40,729
Kim?

1328
01:21:41,729 --> 01:21:43,096
Yeah, hi.

1329
01:21:43,096 --> 01:21:44,096
[Thomas] Hey.

1330
01:21:43,096 --> 01:21:44,198
Hey.

1331
01:21:45,198 --> 01:21:46,198
[door closes]

1332
01:21:45,198 --> 01:21:46,201
What's up, Kim?

1333
01:21:47,201 --> 01:21:50,237
Uh, your dad said
you needed hot sauce
for your dinner.

1334
01:21:50,237 --> 01:21:52,172
Yeah, we're out
of hot sauce.

1335
01:21:52,172 --> 01:21:53,275
Dad, I made
chicken Alfredo.

1336
01:21:55,275 --> 01:21:56,476
Everything goes
with hot sauce.

1337
01:21:56,476 --> 01:21:58,114
Mm-hmm.
You like hot sauce?

1338
01:22:01,114 --> 01:22:02,750
-Sure.
-See? See?

1339
01:22:02,750 --> 01:22:04,417
How about you stay
for dinner?

1340
01:22:04,417 --> 01:22:07,755
You know what, I only made
enough for us three, so...

1341
01:22:07,755 --> 01:22:09,757
[chuckles]

1342
01:22:10,757 --> 01:22:12,760
Maybe next time.

1343
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:14,229
Thanks.

1344
01:22:15,229 --> 01:22:17,365
[scoffs]
Nice necklace.

1345
01:22:18,365 --> 01:22:19,533
[door opens]

1346
01:22:19,533 --> 01:22:21,034
Why don't we all sit down.

1347
01:22:21,034 --> 01:22:21,034
[door closes]

1348
01:22:21,935 --> 01:22:23,570
And there are so many
who have so little.

1349
01:22:23,570 --> 01:22:26,041
Thank you
for this food. Amen.

1350
01:22:27,041 --> 01:22:27,842
Amen.

1351
01:22:28,842 --> 01:22:31,380
So, Jubilee, what do you want
to do after you graduate?

1352
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:34,582
You know,
I don't really know.

1353
01:22:34,582 --> 01:22:36,417
She's going on
a cross-country horse trip.

1354
01:22:37,417 --> 01:22:38,685
Doesn't that take
a lot of money?

1355
01:22:38,685 --> 01:22:40,520
Not once you have
the horse.

1356
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:42,256
It'd be a lot of money
for this family.

1357
01:22:42,256 --> 01:22:44,693
Not if you do something
called saving.

1358
01:22:45,693 --> 01:22:50,463
Must be nice being able
to take all that time
off work.

1359
01:22:50,463 --> 01:22:51,798
Do you have something
against riding?

1360
01:22:51,798 --> 01:22:57,506
No, no. I'm just admiring
your privileged life.

1361
01:22:58,506 --> 01:23:00,240
You should be grateful.
[chuckles]

1362
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:02,542
Well, I'm not going
anymore.

1363
01:23:02,542 --> 01:23:04,413
What do you mean?

1364
01:23:06,413 --> 01:23:08,518
It was too much for my dad.

1365
01:23:10,518 --> 01:23:13,421
Everything I want
gets taken from me.

1366
01:23:13,421 --> 01:23:14,822
[Thomas] Mmm.

1367
01:23:14,822 --> 01:23:18,725
Yeah. Welcome to
our reality, young lady.

1368
01:23:18,725 --> 01:23:20,327
Well, that's what
happened to me.

1369
01:23:20,327 --> 01:23:22,162
That's what happened
to Jordan.

1370
01:23:22,162 --> 01:23:26,734
That's just ordinary life
outside of your ivory castle.

1371

1372
01:23:28,770 --> 01:23:30,305
So you think you're
the only one with problems?

You think that

makes a decent income

1374
01:23:33,239 --> 01:23:34,841
that my dreams aren't valid?

I thought you said
that wasn't a big deal.

I didn't want you
to worry about it.
You got enough going on.

take me home?

I know you're not fine.

But you can lie to me
about your concussion?

1401
01:26:09,630 --> 01:26:11,731
Why didn't you stand up
for me last night?

1402
01:26:11,731 --> 01:26:15,502
I'm sorry. I didn't know
that was gonna happen.

about our dreams.

That's why we have
to fight for them.

just going through
a whole lot at the time,

so he should be able to do
anything you need him to do.

Forgettin' something?

1551
01:41:16,469 --> 01:41:17,509
Thanks, Logan.

1552
01:41:22,509 --> 01:41:24,444
Dad, you sure
you're okay with this?

1553
01:41:25,444 --> 01:41:27,913
Yeah. I couldn't be
more proud.

1554
01:41:27,913 --> 01:41:29,748
But we haven't
even started yet.

1555
01:41:29,748 --> 01:41:32,286
Ah, sweetheart,
I'm not talking
about the ride.

1556
01:41:33,286 --> 01:41:35,390
I'm talking about
everything you've done
for this family.

1557
01:41:37,390 --> 01:41:38,757
Stop. Stop.

1558
01:41:38,757 --> 01:41:41,757
Don't get mushy
on me, all right?

1559
01:41:38,757 --> 01:41:41,161
Okay.

1560
01:41:41,161 --> 01:41:42,628
You two need
to get on out of here.

1561
01:41:42,628 --> 01:41:44,796
The trailer's already
packed, and I'll...

1562
01:41:44,796 --> 01:41:47,699
catch up with you at your
first checkpoint tonight.

1563
01:41:47,699 --> 01:41:50,336
Okay. Thanks for
running support, Dad.

1564
01:41:50,336 --> 01:41:53,506
Yeah, I think
it was time for me
to take a vacation.

1565
01:41:53,506 --> 01:41:56,876
This way, Logan and I,
we can have a little
road trip, right, son?

1566
01:41:56,876 --> 01:41:58,279
Yeah.

1567
01:41:59,279 --> 01:42:00,813
Seriously, guys.

1568
01:42:00,813 --> 01:42:02,748
It means the world to me.

1569
01:42:02,748 --> 01:42:05,220
Well, we want to be part
of your dream.

1570
01:42:08,220 --> 01:42:10,457
-Take care of my girl.
-Yes, sir, Mr. Grove.

1571
01:42:12,457 --> 01:42:14,493
-I love you, Dad.
-I love you too.

1572
01:42:14,493 --> 01:42:15,895
Have a blast!

1573
01:42:15,895 --> 01:42:19,666
Okay. I love you, Logan.
And I'll see you tonight, man.

1574
01:42:19,666 --> 01:42:21,666
See you.

1575
01:42:19,666 --> 01:42:21,970
Here you go.

1576
01:42:23,970 --> 01:42:26,939

Ready, Jordan?

Are you ready, Ghost?
