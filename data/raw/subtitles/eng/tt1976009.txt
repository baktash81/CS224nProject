conversion, you see?

00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,887
He just finds
ordinary people very...

540
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,451
...ordinary.

541
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,370
Victor, how did you...
Who are you?

542
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:21,043
You're the fallen angel.

543
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,649
Plummeted from any other great
heights lately? (LAUGHING)

544
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,487
Maybe you should try this one.
It's only, oh...

545
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,563
...all of 30 feet.
You've had worse.

546
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,404
I'm afraid the only
thing plummeting here

547
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,369
is my opinion of you,
Mr. Frankenschteen.

All right, Victor.

but suffice it to say...

555
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,243
...Igor and I stand
upon the cusp of...

556
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,325
...creating life
out of death.

Victor. Please.

559
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:01,281
I find your promise more
than a little unsettling.

560
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,601
Ooh.

561
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,684
Superstitious, are we?
No.

562
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,401
Are you not afraid
to challenge the natural order?

563
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,842
Igor, speak up.
What do you think?

564
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,602
Once, I would have agreed
with you, Lorelei,

565
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,761
but think about it.

566
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,251
Twenty years ago,
electric lights

567
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,925
would have been
thought of as magic.

568
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,924
Your injuries in the circus
would have been fatal.

569
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,208
Every day science
and technology

570
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,930
changes the way
we live our lives.

571
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,246
Look at me.

572
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,851
Well said, that man.

573
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,120
Life and death
are different.

574
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,201
"Life and death!"

575
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,523
I dream of a world where
hope replaces fear.

576
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,523
A world where
a murdered man

577
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,204
can stand in court
to face his murderer.

578
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,806
Where a crippled soldier,
shrapnel in his spine...

579
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,610
...can be killed, healed,

580
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,524
then brought back to
life to walk again.

581
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,041
Don't you see? The
possibilities are...

582
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,565
...endless! Life is beautiful!

583
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,486
But unfortunately
it is finite.

584
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,891
Now, tell me what that says.

585
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,801

586
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,041
Thank you very much.

587
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,971
I cannot argue with that.

588
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,482
There it is,
in black and white.

applied science...

590
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,322

not apply such chemistry

because this experiment,

which you imagine
took place...

894
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,205

905
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:14,123
I'll be back
with a warrant.

906
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:35,525
That thing in the
school, Igor...

907
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:40,051
...I looked into its eyes
and there was nothing there.

908
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,768
There is a difference
between using your machines...

909
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,360
...to restore a life
wrongly lost and...

910
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:52,484
...to create something that
was never supposed to exist.

911
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,209
Victor must understand that.

912
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:56,481
Look...

913
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:00,000
...I never thought
I'd leave the circus.

914
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:03,364
I thought I'd be in there
till I died. And Victor...

915
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:06,371
...has given me all this.

916
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:10,006
And all he asked is
that I believe in him.

917
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:12,004
I understand that, Igor.

918
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,050
What I'm saying is...

919
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,404
...don't let yourself be
bullied by anyone ever again.

920
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,843
Victor says he's
your friend.

921
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,842
But if you believe
Victor is on a wrong path,

922
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,843
then you must make a stand.

923
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:34,410
I have to go.

924
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:47,206

me as a scientist...

925
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:49,927
If you truly respect
me as your friend...

926
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,722
...you must listen
to my concerns.

928
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,286

929
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,602

00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,083
Is Victor here?
Yes, sir.

933
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,571
Very well.

Where have you been?

935
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,924
Not wise to be out on the town
when there's a manhunt on.

poorly researched theories

945

Victor, silence.

948
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:52,602

a telegram...

949
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:54,285
...informing me
that you are to go

950

directors at the college.

Yes. What?

Gordon was fast
and strong, sure,

977
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:53,721
but he couldn't
sustain any of that.

978
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:54,921
And towards the end,

979
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:56,724
he was having some
real trouble breathing.

980
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:58,251
Breathing?

981
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:01,809

Yes, of course.

take the charge.

more energy.

...from the atmosphere.

997
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:38,527
It's possible that we can
build a larger version

998
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:39,806

a static burst...

of lightning.

No, it's the same problem.

1001

We can't just make the body
accept that charge.

1002
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:50,490
We are incapable of simply
making larger organs.

two sets of lungs?

brilliant, don't you?

Inspector Turpin, stop...

1250
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:19,730
TURPIN: My guess is that
he's fled the country by now,

1251
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:22,007
more than likely
alongside Finnegan...

1252
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:23,321
...who, a little digging
shows, has an estate,

1253
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:25,641
Castle Erskine in Scotland.

1254
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:26,721
We'll find them there.

1255
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,331
Stop it, Roderick,
damn it!

1256
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:29,851
No, listen to me!

1257
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:32,042
We can catch them now.

1258
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,365
We can...

1259
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,161
...and we will.

1260
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:42,285
What do you mean?

1261
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:45,604
You're being removed
from the case... sir.

be taking your place.

1264
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:53,684
You are on a medical

1265
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:57,807
You had no warrant,
Roderick.

1266
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:01,121
Do you have any idea
the lengths I have been to...

1267
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:03,885
...in order to protect you
from criminal charges?

1268
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:05,721
It was a necessary action.

1269
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:06,961
Really?

1270
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:10,210
In pursuit of what?

1271
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:13,962
High society hunchbacks?

1272

1274
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:21,160
one of the richest
families in England?

1275
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:24,051
Yes, a conspiracy
to create life in...

1276
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:29,407
...a direct, defiant
action against God.

1277
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:33,326
You were the best detective
Scotland Yard had,

1278
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:34,811
but now it's time
for you to rest.

1279
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,809
You must heal.
And when you return,

1280
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:39,571
you will see things
how they really are.

1284
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:37,482
It was a very cold
winter that year.

1285
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:40,366
We lived in the country then.
It was a happy time.

1286
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:42,689
We crept out of
my bedroom window

1287
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:43,807
because we wanted to
play in the snow...

1288
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:45,120
...and so we did.

1289
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:47,645
Until we were...

1290
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:50,483

1293
01:18:57,480 --> 01:18:59,005

1294
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,923

...I was alive.

1296
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:10,926
I looked into my hand
and I was holding this.

1297
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:14,409
It serves to remind me.

1298
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:18,330

1299

1300
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:26,162
...if at all
He does exist...

1301
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:31,204
...sent us into this
world imperfect.

1302
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:35,045
We're weak.

We're fragile.

1304
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:40,689
And we're destined to die.

1305

that is not good enough.
