1
00:01:39,713 --> 00:01:42,432
Three of a kind, let's do this.
That's it? Three guys?

2
00:01:42,593 --> 00:01:45,790
Two guys on the roof. Every guy gets
a share. Five shares is plenty.

3
00:01:45,953 --> 00:01:48,308
Six shares. Don't forget
the guy who planned the job.

4
00:01:48,473 --> 00:01:50,668
He thinks he can sit it out
and still take a slice.

5
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:53,825
-I know why they call him the Joker.
So, why do they call him the Joker?

6
00:01:53,993 --> 00:01:55,745
I heard he wears makeup.
Makeup?

7
00:01:55,913 --> 00:01:57,790
Yeah, to scare people.
You know, war paint.

8
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:12,905
All right, everybody,
hands up, heads down!

9
00:02:13,273 --> 00:02:15,946
I said, hands up, heads down!

10
00:02:16,113 --> 00:02:18,946
Let's go, pal,
I'm making a withdrawal here.

11
00:02:19,193 --> 00:02:20,592
-I said, hands up!
-No!

12
00:02:20,953 --> 00:02:23,103
Here comes the silent alarm.

13
00:02:23,273 --> 00:02:24,547
And there it goes.

14
00:02:24,713 --> 00:02:25,862
Heads down!

15
00:02:26,033 --> 00:02:28,263
All right, tootsie,
you're taking a dive with me.

16
00:02:28,433 --> 00:02:30,993
-Down! I said, stay down there!
Don't hurt me!

17
00:02:31,233 --> 00:02:34,111
It's funny, it didn't dial out to 911.
It was trying to reach a private number.

18
00:02:34,273 --> 00:02:36,104
Is it a problem?
No, I'm done here.

19
00:02:45,113 --> 00:02:47,388
Sit down! Down!

20
00:02:47,873 --> 00:02:49,943
Down! I said, stay down there!

21
00:02:54,033 --> 00:02:56,752
Obviously we don't want you
doing anything with your hands...

22
00:02:56,913 --> 00:02:59,711
...other than holding on for dear life.

23
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:09,064
On the ground! Stay on the ground!

24
00:03:09,233 --> 00:03:12,748
Nobody make a move!
Nobody! Stay down!

25
00:03:28,513 --> 00:03:29,502
Yeah!

26
00:03:32,233 --> 00:03:34,224
You have any idea
who you're stealing from?

27
00:03:34,393 --> 00:03:37,942
-You and your friends are dead.
He's out, right?

28
00:03:40,913 --> 00:03:42,107
What--?

29
00:03:49,633 --> 00:03:51,305
Where did you learn to count?

30
00:03:53,993 --> 00:03:55,949
They wired this thing up
with like 5000 volts.

31
00:03:56,113 --> 00:03:57,307
What kind of bank does that?

32
00:03:57,473 --> 00:04:00,385
A Mob bank.
I guess the Joker's as crazy as they say.

33
00:04:00,553 --> 00:04:01,542
Where's the alarm guy?

34
00:04:01,713 --> 00:04:04,102
Boss told me when the guy
was done, I should take him out.

35
00:04:04,273 --> 00:04:05,547
One less share, right?

36
00:04:06,433 --> 00:04:08,583
Funny, he told me something similar.

37
00:04:08,753 --> 00:04:10,152
He what? No! No!

38
00:04:21,393 --> 00:04:22,712
That's a lot of money.

39
00:04:22,873 --> 00:04:26,422
If this Joker guy was so smart,
he'd have us bring a bigger car.

40
00:04:27,793 --> 00:04:31,547
I'm betting the Joker told you to kill me
soon as we loaded the cash.

41
00:04:32,433 --> 00:04:36,062
No, no, no, no, I kill the bus driver.

42
00:04:36,753 --> 00:04:37,822
Bus driver?

43
00:04:39,953 --> 00:04:41,386
What bus driver?

44
00:04:45,313 --> 00:04:47,144
School's out. Time to go.

45
00:04:47,313 --> 00:04:49,463
Cat's not getting up, is he?

46
00:04:50,193 --> 00:04:51,785
That's a lot of money.

47
00:04:55,153 --> 00:04:57,383
What happened to the rest of the guys?

48
00:05:03,873 --> 00:05:06,148
You think you're smart, huh?

49
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,391
The guy that hired youse...

50
00:05:08,913 --> 00:05:11,381
...he'll just do the same to you.

51
00:05:11,673 --> 00:05:14,506
Oh, criminals in this town
used to believe in things.

52
00:05:14,673 --> 00:05:15,901
Honor...

53
00:05:16,073 --> 00:05:17,711
...respect.

54
00:05:17,873 --> 00:05:20,103
Look at you.
What do you believe in, huh?

55
00:05:20,273 --> 00:05:21,501
What do you believe in?

56
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:26,543
I believe whatever doesn't kill you
simply makes you...

57
00:05:28,073 --> 00:05:29,552
...stranger.

58
00:06:09,793 --> 00:06:12,591
Mr. Mayor, you were elected
in a campaign to clean up the city.

59
00:06:12,753 --> 00:06:14,823
-When are you gonna start?
Well, Mike, I believe I already have.

60
00:06:14,993 --> 00:06:16,028
Like the so-called Batman.

61
00:06:16,193 --> 00:06:18,661
We're hearing he's doing some good,
the criminals are running scared. But I say...

62
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:22,382
-No, man. I don't like it tonight.
-What are you, superstitious?

63
00:06:22,553 --> 00:06:25,511
You got more chance of winning
the Power bowl than running into him.

64
00:06:25,673 --> 00:06:28,904
That simply is not true.
I'm told that our men in the
Major Crimes Unit are close to an arrest.

65
00:06:29,073 --> 00:06:31,906
Hey, Wuertz, mayor says
you're closing in on the Batman.

66
00:06:32,073 --> 00:06:34,109
The investigation is ongoing.

67
00:06:34,273 --> 00:06:36,582
The process of cleaning up
the streets is a long one.

68
00:06:36,753 --> 00:06:38,664
I pledged in my campaign, uh, to have....

69
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:45,028
Ever intending to see your wife again,
Lieutenant?

70
00:06:45,193 --> 00:06:47,753
I thought you had to
go look after your mother, Detective.

71
00:06:47,913 --> 00:06:49,790
Checked her back into the hospital.

72
00:06:50,233 --> 00:06:51,791
I'm sorry.

73
00:06:52,273 --> 00:06:55,424
-So he hasn't shown up?
-He often doesn't.

74
00:06:55,793 --> 00:06:57,431
I like reminding everybody
that he's out there.

75
00:06:57,593 --> 00:06:58,821
Why wouldn't he come?

76
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:00,905
Hopefully...

77
00:07:01,393 --> 00:07:02,872
...because he's busy.

78
00:07:18,913 --> 00:07:21,711
That's why we bring dogs.

79
00:07:21,873 --> 00:07:24,103
-My little princes.
Please.

80
00:07:24,273 --> 00:07:27,709
Please, they're crawling in my mouth.
Please, I beg you, get them off.

81
00:07:27,873 --> 00:07:30,512
Look what your drugs
do to my customers.

82
00:07:30,673 --> 00:07:32,231
Buyer beware!

83
00:07:32,393 --> 00:07:35,465
I told you my compound
would take you places.

84
00:07:35,633 --> 00:07:38,272
I never said they'd be places
you wanted to go.

85
00:07:38,433 --> 00:07:40,867
My business, repeat customers.

86
00:07:41,033 --> 00:07:42,671
You don't like
what I have to offer...

87
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,505
...you can buy from someone else.

88
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:47,312
Assuming Batman left anyone
to buy from.

89
00:07:50,513 --> 00:07:54,347
My dogs are hungry.

90
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:00,108
Pity there's only one of you.

91
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:09,345
What--?
That's not him.

92
00:08:13,553 --> 00:08:15,225
Loose the dogs!

93
00:08:27,433 --> 00:08:28,912
That's more like it.

94
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:55,065
Don't let me find you out here again.

95
00:09:55,233 --> 00:09:57,952
-We're trying to help you.
I don't need help.

96
00:09:58,113 --> 00:09:59,387
Not my diagnosis.

97
00:09:59,553 --> 00:10:02,989
What gives you the right? What's
the difference between you and me?

98
00:10:03,153 --> 00:10:05,906
I'm not wearing hockey pads.

99
00:10:09,273 --> 00:10:11,150
Everybody back now!

100
00:10:13,233 --> 00:10:16,270
He can't resist showing us his face.

101
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,423
What's he hiding under that makeup?

102
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:32,393
Uh, can we get a minute,
people, please?

103
00:10:34,913 --> 00:10:36,983
Him again. Who are the others?

104
00:10:37,153 --> 00:10:38,666
Another bunch of small timers.

105
00:10:39,993 --> 00:10:41,631
Some of the marked bills I gave you.

106
00:10:41,793 --> 00:10:43,988
My detectives have been
making drug buys with them for weeks.

107
00:10:44,153 --> 00:10:46,621
This bank was another drop for the Mob.
That makes five.

108
00:10:46,793 --> 00:10:49,261
-We found the bulk of their dirty cash.
-Time to move in.

109
00:10:49,433 --> 00:10:53,062
We'd have to hit all banks
simultaneously. SWAT teams, backup.

110
00:10:53,393 --> 00:10:54,985
What about this Joker guy?

111
00:10:55,153 --> 00:10:57,986
One man or the entire Mob? He can wait.

112
00:10:58,153 --> 00:11:00,383
When the new DA hears about this,
he'll want in.

113
00:11:00,553 --> 00:11:02,987
-Do you trust him?
-Be hard to keep him out.

114
00:11:03,153 --> 00:11:06,463
I hear he's as stubborn as you are.

115
00:11:48,233 --> 00:11:51,066
Be nice when Wayne Manor's rebuilt.

116
00:11:51,233 --> 00:11:53,827
You can swap
not sleeping in a penthouse...

117
00:11:53,993 --> 00:11:55,472
...for not sleeping in a mansion.

118
00:11:55,633 --> 00:11:59,228
Whenever you stitch yourself up,
you do make a bloody mess.

119
00:11:59,393 --> 00:12:02,271
Yeah. It makes me learn
from my mistakes.

120
00:12:02,433 --> 00:12:05,709
You ought to be pretty knowledgeable
by now, then.

121
00:12:07,353 --> 00:12:08,342
My armor.

122
00:12:08,513 --> 00:12:11,949
I'm carrying too much weight.
I need to be-- I need to be faster.

123
00:12:12,113 --> 00:12:14,673
I'm sure Mr. Fox can oblige.

124
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:17,222
-Did you get mauled by a tiger?
-It was a dog.

125
00:12:17,393 --> 00:12:19,827
-Huh?
-It was a big dog.

126
00:12:19,993 --> 00:12:23,702
There were more copycats last night,
Alfred, with guns.

127
00:12:23,873 --> 00:12:25,704
Why don't you hire them and
take the weekend off?

128
00:12:25,873 --> 00:12:28,592
That wasn't exactly
what I had in mind...

129
00:12:28,753 --> 00:12:30,425
...when I said I wanted
to inspire people.

130
00:12:30,593 --> 00:12:32,424
I know.

131
00:12:32,593 --> 00:12:34,026
But things have improved.

132
00:12:34,233 --> 00:12:36,588
Look at the new district attorney.

133
00:12:37,233 --> 00:12:39,144
I am, closely.

134
00:12:39,313 --> 00:12:41,144
Need to know if he can be trusted.

135
00:12:41,313 --> 00:12:45,192
Are you interested in his character
or his social circle?

136
00:12:48,873 --> 00:12:51,148
Who Rachel spends her time with
is her business.

137
00:12:52,873 --> 00:12:55,023
I trust you don't have me followed
on my day off.

138
00:12:55,193 --> 00:12:57,184
If you ever took one, I might.

139
00:12:58,953 --> 00:13:00,750
Know your limits, Master Wayne.

140
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:03,905
Batman has no limits.

141
00:13:04,073 --> 00:13:06,985
-Well, you do, sir.
-Well, can't afford to know them.

142
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,542
And what's gonna happen
on the day that you find out?

143
00:13:09,713 --> 00:13:12,307
We all know how much you like to say
"I told you so."

144
00:13:12,473 --> 00:13:15,670
On that day, Master Wayne,
even I won't want to.

145
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,232
Probably.

146
00:13:23,793 --> 00:13:25,385
Sorry I'm late, folks.

147
00:13:29,153 --> 00:13:31,269
-Where were you?
-Worried you'd have to step up?

148
00:13:31,433 --> 00:13:34,311
-Harvey, I know these briefs backwards.
-Well, then...

149
00:13:34,473 --> 00:13:36,384
...fair's fair.

150
00:13:36,553 --> 00:13:38,509
Heads, I'll take it. Tails, he's all yours.

151
00:13:38,673 --> 00:13:40,664
Yeah? You wanna
flip a coin to see who leads?

152
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:44,109
It's my father's lucky coin. As I recall,
it got me my first date with you.

153
00:13:44,273 --> 00:13:47,310
I wouldn't leave something like that
up to chance.

154
00:13:47,633 --> 00:13:50,591
I don't. I make my own luck.

155
00:13:52,033 --> 00:13:55,912
All rise.
The Honorable Judge Freel presiding.

156
00:13:56,073 --> 00:13:58,633
I thought the DA just played golf
with the mayor or things like that.

157
00:13:58,793 --> 00:14:02,342
Tee-off's 1:30. More than enough time
to put you away for life, Sally.

158
00:14:02,513 --> 00:14:03,992
With Carmine Falcone in Arkham...

159
00:14:04,153 --> 00:14:07,031
...someone must have stepped up
to run the so-called family.

160
00:14:07,873 --> 00:14:10,023
Is that man in this courtroom today?

161
00:14:11,513 --> 00:14:14,983
-Could you identify him for us, please?
-You win, counselor.

162
00:14:17,233 --> 00:14:18,666
It was me.

163
00:14:20,313 --> 00:14:23,942
I have a sworn statement from you
that this man...

164
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:27,662
...Salvatore Maroni, is the new head
of the Falcone crime family.

165
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:31,792
Maroni? He's a fall guy.
I'm the brains of the organization.

166
00:14:33,113 --> 00:14:34,592
Order.
-Permission to treat...

167
00:14:34,753 --> 00:14:35,947
-...the witness as hostile?
-Granted.

168
00:14:36,113 --> 00:14:37,102
-Hostile? I'll show you hostile!

169
00:14:43,073 --> 00:14:45,712
Carbon fiber, .28 caliber,
made in China.

170
00:14:45,873 --> 00:14:47,352
If you wanna kill a
public servant, Mr. Maroni...

171
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:49,629
...I recommend you buy American.

172
00:14:50,513 --> 00:14:53,027
Get him out of here.
-But, Your Honor, I'm not done.

173
00:14:56,593 --> 00:14:59,744
We'll never be able to link the gun to Maroni,
so we won't be able to charge him.

174
00:14:59,913 --> 00:15:02,586
But the fact that they're trying to kill you,
means we're getting to them.

175
00:15:02,753 --> 00:15:05,745
I'm glad you're so pleased, Rachel.
I'm fine, by the way.

176
00:15:05,913 --> 00:15:07,551
Come on, Harvey. You're Gotham's DA.

177
00:15:07,713 --> 00:15:10,432
You're not getting shot at,
you're not doing your job right.

178
00:15:10,593 --> 00:15:11,742
But, you know...

179
00:15:11,913 --> 00:15:15,110
...if you said you were rattled,
we could take the rest of the day off.

180
00:15:15,273 --> 00:15:18,071
Can't. I dragged the head of
the Major Crimes Unit down here.

181
00:15:18,233 --> 00:15:22,784
Oh, Jim Gordon? He's a friend, actually.
Try to be nice.

182
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:34,146
I hear you got a hell of a right cross.

183
00:15:37,313 --> 00:15:39,349
It's a shame Sal's going to walk.

184
00:15:39,513 --> 00:15:43,392
Yeah, well, good thing about the Mob
is they keep giving you second chances.

185
00:15:48,353 --> 00:15:50,583
Lightly irradiated bills.

186
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,228
Fancy stuff for a city cop. Have help?

187
00:15:53,673 --> 00:15:55,311
We liaise with various agencies--

188
00:15:55,473 --> 00:15:57,145
Save it, Gordon. I wanna meet him.

189
00:15:57,313 --> 00:16:00,749
Official policy is to arrest the vigilante
known as Batman on sight.

190
00:16:00,913 --> 00:16:02,983
Mm-hm. What about that floodlight
on the top of MCU?

191
00:16:03,153 --> 00:16:05,462
If you got problems
with malfunctioning equipment...

192
00:16:05,633 --> 00:16:08,705
...I suggest you take them up
with Maintenance, counselor.

193
00:16:08,993 --> 00:16:11,427
I've put every money launderer
in Gotham behind bars...

194
00:16:11,593 --> 00:16:13,868
...but the Mob
is still getting its money out.

195
00:16:14,033 --> 00:16:17,343
I think you and your friend
have found the last game in town.

196
00:16:17,513 --> 00:16:20,107
You're trying to hit them
where it hurts, their wallets.

197
00:16:20,273 --> 00:16:21,388
It's bold.

198
00:16:22,393 --> 00:16:23,382
You gonna count me in?

199
00:16:23,913 --> 00:16:27,144
In this town, the fewer people know
something, the safer the operation.

200
00:16:27,313 --> 00:16:29,463
Gordon, I don't like that you got
your own special unit...

201
00:16:29,633 --> 00:16:32,431
...and i don't like that it's full of cops
I investigated at Internal Affairs.

202
00:16:32,593 --> 00:16:35,312
If I didn't work with cops you'd investigated
while you were making your name at IA...

203
00:16:35,473 --> 00:16:36,667
...I'd be working alone.

204
00:16:37,393 --> 00:16:39,224
I don't get political points
for being an idealist.

205
00:16:39,393 --> 00:16:41,702
I have to do the best I can with what I have.

206
00:16:45,153 --> 00:16:48,748
You want me to back warrants
for search and seizure on five banks...

207
00:16:48,913 --> 00:16:50,665
...without telling me what we're after.

208
00:16:51,713 --> 00:16:54,181
I can give you the names of the banks.

209
00:16:54,353 --> 00:16:56,184
Well, that's a start.

210
00:16:56,553 --> 00:16:58,783
I'll get you your warrants,
but I want your trust.

211
00:16:58,953 --> 00:17:00,545
Oh, you don't have
to sell me, Dent.

212
00:17:00,713 --> 00:17:02,624
We all know you're Gotham's
white knight.

213
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:07,143
Yeah, well, I heard they have
a different name for me down at MCU.

214
00:17:07,713 --> 00:17:08,941
I wouldn't know about that.

215
00:17:10,073 --> 00:17:13,702
In China, Lau Security Investments
stands for dynamic new growth.

216
00:17:13,873 --> 00:17:17,991
A joint Chinese venture with
Wayne Enterprises will be a powerhouse.

217
00:17:18,153 --> 00:17:19,984
Well, Mr. Lau...

218
00:17:20,353 --> 00:17:22,992
...I speak for the rest of the board...

219
00:17:23,553 --> 00:17:26,351
...and Mr. Wayne,
in expressing our own excitement.

220
00:17:31,033 --> 00:17:34,503
Sir, I know that Mr. Wayne is curious
about how his trust fund gets replenished...

221
00:17:34,673 --> 00:17:37,062
...but, frankly, this is embarrassing.

222
00:17:37,233 --> 00:17:39,701
You worry about the diligence,
Mr. Reese.

223
00:17:39,873 --> 00:17:42,068
I'll worry about Bruce Wayne.

224
00:17:42,233 --> 00:17:43,712
It's done.

225
00:17:43,873 --> 00:17:45,545
The numbers are solid.

226
00:17:45,713 --> 00:17:47,192
Do them again.

227
00:17:47,353 --> 00:17:50,311
Wouldn't want the trust fund to run out,
now, would we?

228
00:17:52,913 --> 00:17:54,471
Another long night?

229
00:17:54,633 --> 00:17:57,466
This joint venture was your idea,
and the consultants love it.

230
00:17:58,113 --> 00:17:59,307
But I'm not convinced.

231
00:17:59,473 --> 00:18:02,988
Lau's company has grown by
8 percent annually like clockwork.

232
00:18:03,153 --> 00:18:05,462
His revenue stream
must be off the books...

233
00:18:05,633 --> 00:18:06,986
...maybe even illegal.

234
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:08,745
Okay. Cancel the deal.

235
00:18:10,033 --> 00:18:11,148
You already knew.

236
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:14,267
Just needed a closer look at their books.

237
00:18:14,433 --> 00:18:16,389
Anything else you can trouble me for?

238
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,312
I need a new suit.

239
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:20,862
Yeah. Three buttons
is a little '90s, Mr. Wayne.

240
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:24,025
I'm not talking fashion, Mr. Fox,
so much as function.

241
00:18:25,033 --> 00:18:26,671
You wanna be able to turn your head.

242
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,824
Sure make backing out
of the driveway easier.

243
00:18:29,273 --> 00:18:30,752
I'll see what I can do.

244
00:18:35,313 --> 00:18:37,190
Took me three weeks
to get a reservation here.

245
00:18:37,353 --> 00:18:39,389
And I had to tell them
I work for the government.

246
00:18:39,553 --> 00:18:40,747
-Really?
-The city Health inspector's...

247
00:18:40,913 --> 00:18:42,107
...not afraid to pull strings.

248
00:18:42,273 --> 00:18:44,389
Rachel. Fancy that.

249
00:18:44,553 --> 00:18:46,942
Yeah, Bruce. Fancy that.

250
00:18:47,273 --> 00:18:49,343
Rachel, Natascha. Natascha, Rachel.

251
00:18:49,513 --> 00:18:54,667
-Natascha. Are you the prima--?
-Prima ballerina for the Moscow Ballet.

252
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:58,030
-Wow. Harvey's taking me next week.
-Really? So you're into ballet?

253
00:18:58,353 --> 00:19:00,423
Bruce. This is Harvey Dent.

254
00:19:00,753 --> 00:19:04,348
The famous Bruce Wayne.
Rachel's told me everything about you.

255
00:19:04,513 --> 00:19:05,662
I certainly hope not.

256
00:19:05,993 --> 00:19:09,190
-So, let's put a couple of tables together.
-I'm not sure that they'll let us.

257
00:19:09,353 --> 00:19:12,265
Oh, they should. I own the place.

258
00:19:12,713 --> 00:19:15,546
How could you want to raise children
in a city like this?

259
00:19:15,713 --> 00:19:17,590
Well, I was raised here.
I turned out okay.

260
00:19:17,753 --> 00:19:19,266
Is Wayne Manor in the city limits?

261
00:19:19,433 --> 00:19:20,866
Is--? Heh-heh.

262
00:19:21,033 --> 00:19:22,512
The Palisades? Sure.

263
00:19:22,673 --> 00:19:25,028
You know, as our new DA,
you might wanna figure out...

264
00:19:25,193 --> 00:19:26,945
...where your jurisdiction ends.

265
00:19:27,113 --> 00:19:30,901
I'm talking about the kind of city
that idolizes a masked vigilante.

266
00:19:31,073 --> 00:19:34,304
Gotham City is proud of an ordinary
citizen standing up for what's right.

267
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:36,623
Gotham needs heroes like you,
elected officials...

268
00:19:36,793 --> 00:19:38,670
...not a man who thinks
he's above the law.

269
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:39,948
Exactly. Who appointed the Batman?

270
00:19:40,113 --> 00:19:43,788
We did. All of us who stood by
and let scum take control of our city.

271
00:19:43,953 --> 00:19:45,625
But this is a democracy, Harvey.

272
00:19:45,793 --> 00:19:47,465
When their enemies were at the gates...

273
00:19:47,633 --> 00:19:51,182
...the Romans would suspend democracy
and appoint one man to protect the city.

274
00:19:51,353 --> 00:19:53,821
It wasn't considered an honor,
it was considered a public service.

275
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:55,585
Harvey, the last man
that they appointed...

276
00:19:55,753 --> 00:19:57,948
...to protect the republic
was named Caesar...

277
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:01,389
-...and he never gave up his power.
-Okay, fine.

278
00:20:01,553 --> 00:20:02,827
You either die a hero...

279
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:05,905
...or you live long enough
to see yourself become the villain.

280
00:20:06,073 --> 00:20:09,429
Look, Whoever the Batman is, he doesn't
wanna do this for the rest of his life.

281
00:20:09,593 --> 00:20:12,710
How could he? Batman is looking for
someone to take up his mantle.

282
00:20:12,873 --> 00:20:15,068
Someone like you, Mr. Dent?

283
00:20:15,513 --> 00:20:17,868
Maybe. If I'm up to it.

284
00:20:18,033 --> 00:20:23,061
What if Harvey Dent
is the Caped Crusader? Hm?

285
00:20:25,233 --> 00:20:28,270
If I were sneaking out every night,
someone would've noticed by now.

286
00:20:30,553 --> 00:20:34,512
Well, I'm sold, Dent,
and I'm gonna throw you a fundraiser.

287
00:20:34,673 --> 00:20:37,392
That's nice of you Bruce, but I'm not
up for re-election for three years.

288
00:20:37,553 --> 00:20:39,384
No, you don't understand.

289
00:20:39,553 --> 00:20:42,226
One fundraiser with my pals...

290
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,869
...you'll never need another cent.

291
00:20:58,993 --> 00:21:01,029
What the hell is this?

292
00:21:02,313 --> 00:21:05,305
As you're all aware,
one of our deposits was stolen.

293
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:08,704
A relatively small amount, 68 million.

294
00:21:08,873 --> 00:21:11,307
Who's stupid enough to steal from us?

295
00:21:11,633 --> 00:21:15,023
Two-bit wackjob,
wears a cheap purple suit and makeup.

296
00:21:15,193 --> 00:21:17,070
He's not the problem. He's a nobody.

297
00:21:17,233 --> 00:21:20,464
The problem is our money
being tracked by the cops.

298
00:21:20,633 --> 00:21:23,022
Thanks to Mr. Maroni's
well-placed sources...

299
00:21:23,193 --> 00:21:26,822
...we know that police have indeed
identified our banks using marked bills...

300
00:21:26,993 --> 00:21:29,382
...and are planning to
seize your funds today.

301
00:21:29,553 --> 00:21:33,387
And since the enthusiastic new DA has
put all my competitors out of business...

302
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:37,349
-...I'm your only option.
So, what are you proposing?

303
00:21:37,513 --> 00:21:41,028
Moving all deposits to
one secure location, not a bank.

304
00:21:41,193 --> 00:21:43,070
-Where, then?
-No one can know but me.

305
00:21:43,793 --> 00:21:46,432
If the police were to gain leverage
over one of you...

306
00:21:46,593 --> 00:21:48,311
...everyone's money would be at stake.

307
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,509
What stop them getting to you?

308
00:21:50,673 --> 00:21:53,631
I go to Hong Kong,
far from Dent's jurisdiction...

309
00:21:53,993 --> 00:21:56,746
...and the Chinese will not extradite
one of their own.

310
00:21:56,913 --> 00:21:58,471
How soon can you move the money?

311
00:21:58,753 --> 00:21:59,788
I already have.

312
00:22:02,073 --> 00:22:04,587
For obvious reasons, I couldn't wait
for your permission.

313
00:22:05,193 --> 00:22:08,708
Rest assured, your money is safe.

314
00:22:15,593 --> 00:22:20,383
Oh, hee-hee, aha.
Ha, ooh, hee, ha, ha-ha.

315
00:22:20,553 --> 00:22:22,703
And I thought my jokes were bad.

316
00:22:22,873 --> 00:22:25,831
Give me one reason why I shouldn't
have my boy here pull your head off.

317
00:22:25,993 --> 00:22:27,221
How about a magic trick?

318
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:32,663
I'm gonna make this pencil disappear.

319
00:22:34,873 --> 00:22:35,942
Ta-da!

320
00:22:36,113 --> 00:22:37,546
It's--

321
00:22:37,713 --> 00:22:39,908
It's gone.

322
00:22:40,273 --> 00:22:42,503
Oh, and by the way,
the suit, it wasn't cheap.

323
00:22:42,673 --> 00:22:45,392
-You ought to know, you bought it.
Sit.

324
00:22:46,433 --> 00:22:49,345
I want to hear proposition.

325
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:54,342
Let's wind the clocks back a year.

326
00:22:54,673 --> 00:23:00,111
These cops and lawyers
wouldn't dare cross any of you.

327
00:23:01,233 --> 00:23:03,269
I mean, what happened?

328
00:23:03,433 --> 00:23:07,062
Did your balls drop off? Hm?

329
00:23:07,233 --> 00:23:09,189
You see, a guy like me....

330
00:23:09,633 --> 00:23:12,272
-A freak.
Damn right.

331
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:15,425
A guy like me-- Look, listen.

332
00:23:15,953 --> 00:23:20,071
I know why you choose
to have your little, ahem...

333
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:22,827
...group-therapy sessions
in broad daylight.

334
00:23:23,313 --> 00:23:25,986
I know why you're afraid
to go out at night.

335
00:23:28,113 --> 00:23:29,705
The Batman.

336
00:23:29,873 --> 00:23:34,901
See, Batman has shown Gotham
your true colors, unfortunately.

337
00:23:35,073 --> 00:23:38,429
Dent, he's just the beginning.

338
00:23:38,993 --> 00:23:43,544
And as for the television's
so-called plan...

339
00:23:43,993 --> 00:23:45,790
...Batman has no jurisdiction.

340
00:23:45,953 --> 00:23:48,421
He'll find him and make him squeal.

341
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:51,471
I know the squealers when I see them...

342
00:23:51,633 --> 00:23:53,225
...and....

343
00:23:53,953 --> 00:23:55,386
What do you propose?

344
00:23:55,553 --> 00:23:57,862
It's simple. We, uh, kill the Batman.

345
00:23:59,153 --> 00:24:01,986
If it's so simple, why haven't
you done it already?

346
00:24:02,153 --> 00:24:04,747
If you're good at something,
never do it for free.

347
00:24:05,393 --> 00:24:06,621
How much you want?

348
00:24:07,313 --> 00:24:09,224
Uh, half.

349
00:24:11,353 --> 00:24:13,992
You're crazy.
-No, I'm not.

350
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:16,189
No, I'm not.

351
00:24:17,713 --> 00:24:20,989
If we don't deal with this now...

352
00:24:21,153 --> 00:24:22,711
...soon...

353
00:24:22,913 --> 00:24:27,623
...little Gambol here won't be able
to get a nickel for his grandma.

354
00:24:28,273 --> 00:24:29,672
Enough from the clown!

355
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:32,666
Ah, ta-ta-ta. Let's not blow...

356
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:35,267
Shit!
-...this out of proportion.

357
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:37,822
You think you can steal from us
and just walk away?

358
00:24:37,993 --> 00:24:39,472
-Yeah.
I'm putting the word out.

359
00:24:39,633 --> 00:24:41,828
Five hundred grand for this clown dead.

360
00:24:41,993 --> 00:24:44,905
A million alive, so I can teach him
some manners first.

361
00:24:46,153 --> 00:24:48,621
All right. So, listen,
why don't you give me a call...

362
00:24:48,793 --> 00:24:52,388
...when you wanna start taking things
a little more seriously?

363
00:24:52,553 --> 00:24:54,350
Here's my card.

364
00:24:58,233 --> 00:25:00,189
Mm-mm.

365
00:25:13,633 --> 00:25:15,908
You're a hard man to reach.

366
00:25:18,793 --> 00:25:20,988
Lau's halfway to Hong Kong.

367
00:25:22,233 --> 00:25:24,952
If you'd have asked, I could have taken his passport.
I told you to keep me in the loop.

368
00:25:25,113 --> 00:25:27,673
All that was left in the vaults
were marked bills.

369
00:25:27,833 --> 00:25:30,984
They knew we were coming.
As soon as your office got involved--

370
00:25:31,153 --> 00:25:32,142
My office?

371
00:25:32,313 --> 00:25:35,828
You're sitting down there with scum like
Wuertz and Ramirez and you're talking--

372
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:38,985
Oh, yeah Gordon. I almost had your rookie
cold on a racketeering beat.

373
00:25:39,153 --> 00:25:43,510
Don't try and cloud the fact that clearly
Maroni's got people in your office, Dent.

374
00:25:46,193 --> 00:25:48,070
We need Lau back...

375
00:25:48,233 --> 00:25:52,021
...but the Chinese won't extradite
a national under any circumstances.

376
00:25:52,353 --> 00:25:54,947
If I get him to you,
can you get him to talk?

377
00:25:55,113 --> 00:25:56,262
I'll get him to sing.

378
00:25:56,433 --> 00:25:59,072
We're going after the Mob's life savings.

379
00:25:59,233 --> 00:26:00,427
Things will get ugly.

380
00:26:00,593 --> 00:26:02,788
I knew the risk when I took this job,
Lieutenant.

381
00:26:02,953 --> 00:26:04,432
How will you get him back, any--?

382
00:26:06,913 --> 00:26:08,266
He does that.

383
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:11,789
Our Chinese friends left town
before I could tell them the deal was off.

384
00:26:11,953 --> 00:26:15,309
Well, I'm sure that you've always
wanted to go to Hong Kong.

385
00:26:15,473 --> 00:26:17,543
What's wrong with a phone call?

386
00:26:17,713 --> 00:26:21,183
I think Mr. Lau deserves
a more personal touch.

387
00:26:22,353 --> 00:26:24,105
Now, for high-altitude jumps...

388
00:26:24,273 --> 00:26:26,946
...you're going to need oxygen
and stabilizers.

389
00:26:27,113 --> 00:26:30,583
Well, I must say,
compared to your usual requests...

390
00:26:30,753 --> 00:26:33,221
...jumping out of an airplane
is pretty straightforward.

391
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:35,869
What about getting back into the plane?

392
00:26:36,033 --> 00:26:39,708
-I'd recommend a good travel agent.
-Without it landing.

393
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:43,472
Now, that's more like it, Mr. Wayne.

394
00:26:43,993 --> 00:26:46,507
The CIA had a program
back in the '60s...

395
00:26:46,673 --> 00:26:49,870
...for getting their people out
of hot spots called Sky Hook.

396
00:26:50,033 --> 00:26:52,593
-We could look into that.
-Yeah.

397
00:26:52,753 --> 00:26:54,345
Okay. Now....

398
00:26:55,793 --> 00:26:58,387
Hardened Kevlar plates
over titanium-dipped...

399
00:26:58,553 --> 00:27:00,589
...tri-weave fibers for flexibility.

400
00:27:00,753 --> 00:27:03,472
You'll be lighter, faster, more agile.

401
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,903
Perhaps you should
read the instructions first?

402
00:27:09,073 --> 00:27:10,984
-Yeah.
-Now, there is a tradeoff.

403
00:27:11,153 --> 00:27:14,509
Separation of the plates makes you
more vulnerable to knives and gunfire.

404
00:27:14,673 --> 00:27:17,506
We wouldn't wanna make things
too easy, now, would we?

405
00:27:17,673 --> 00:27:19,629
How will it hold up against dogs?

406
00:27:19,793 --> 00:27:21,829
We talking rottweilers or Chihuahuas?

407
00:27:22,993 --> 00:27:25,382
Should do fine against cats.

408
00:27:25,553 --> 00:27:27,589
I found one in Arizona.

409
00:27:27,753 --> 00:27:30,551
A very nice man said he could have it
up and running in a week...

410
00:27:30,713 --> 00:27:31,748
...and he'd take the cash.

411
00:27:31,913 --> 00:27:34,632
-What about the flight crew?
-South Korean smugglers.

412
00:27:34,793 --> 00:27:36,909
They run flights into Pyongyang,
below radar the whole way.

413
00:27:37,073 --> 00:27:39,712
-Did you think of an alibi?
-Oh, yes.

414
00:27:57,713 --> 00:28:00,227
I believe this is your plane, sir.

415
00:28:04,273 --> 00:28:07,629
You look tired, Alfred.
You'll be all right without me?

416
00:28:09,233 --> 00:28:12,589
If you can tell me the Russian for
"apply your own bloody suntan lotion."

417
00:28:23,273 --> 00:28:26,948
Yo, Gambol, somebody here for you.
They say they've just killed the Joker.

418
00:28:27,113 --> 00:28:28,865
They brought the body.

419
00:28:44,593 --> 00:28:46,982
So, dead, that's 500.

420
00:28:48,873 --> 00:28:50,591
How about alive? Hm?

421
00:28:53,673 --> 00:28:56,710
You wanna know how I got these scars?

422
00:28:58,553 --> 00:29:01,431
My father was...

423
00:29:01,593 --> 00:29:02,992
...a drinker...

424
00:29:03,153 --> 00:29:04,347
...and a fiend.

425
00:29:05,153 --> 00:29:09,146
And one night,
he goes off crazier than usual.

426
00:29:09,553 --> 00:29:12,226
Mommy gets the kitchen knife
to defend herself.

427
00:29:12,393 --> 00:29:13,872
He doesn't like that...

428
00:29:14,033 --> 00:29:17,343
...not one bit.

429
00:29:17,513 --> 00:29:19,947
So, me watching...

430
00:29:20,113 --> 00:29:24,504
...he takes the knife to her,
laughing while he does it.

431
00:29:24,673 --> 00:29:27,631
He turns to me and he says:

432
00:29:27,793 --> 00:29:31,308
"Why so serious?"

433
00:29:31,553 --> 00:29:33,066
He comes at me with the knife.

434
00:29:33,713 --> 00:29:35,544
"Why so serious?"

435
00:29:37,713 --> 00:29:40,466
He sticks the blade in my mouth.

436
00:29:40,793 --> 00:29:44,547
"Let's put a smile on that face."

437
00:29:45,713 --> 00:29:47,829
And....

438
00:29:50,113 --> 00:29:51,592
Why so serious?

439
00:29:56,433 --> 00:29:57,866
Now...

440
00:29:58,033 --> 00:30:00,183
...our operation is small...

441
00:30:00,353 --> 00:30:03,151
...but there is a lot of potential...

442
00:30:03,313 --> 00:30:05,747
...for aggressive expansion.

443
00:30:05,913 --> 00:30:08,985
So which of you fine gentlemen
would like to join our team?

444
00:30:09,153 --> 00:30:13,385
Oh. There's only one spot open
right now, so we're gonna have...

445
00:30:14,033 --> 00:30:16,103
...tryouts.

446
00:30:20,513 --> 00:30:22,424
Make it fast.

447
00:30:31,473 --> 00:30:32,826
Welcome to Hong Kong, Mr. Fox.

448
00:30:32,993 --> 00:30:35,587
Mr. Lau regrets he is unable
to greet you in person today.

449
00:30:35,753 --> 00:30:37,584
I understand.

450
00:30:46,993 --> 00:30:50,429
For security purposes, I'm gonna have to
ask you to check in your mobile.

451
00:30:50,593 --> 00:30:52,106
Of course.

452
00:30:54,753 --> 00:30:58,302
I must apologize for leaving Gotham
in the middle of our negotiations.

453
00:30:58,473 --> 00:31:01,863
This misunderstanding
with the Gotham police force...

454
00:31:02,033 --> 00:31:04,467
-...I couldn't let such a thing threaten my company.
-Of course.

455
00:31:04,633 --> 00:31:07,670
A businessman of your stature
will understand and...

456
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:11,621
...with you here now, we can continue.

457
00:31:11,793 --> 00:31:15,388
Well, I do appreciate you bringing me
out here in such style, Mr. Lau, but I re--

458
00:31:16,873 --> 00:31:18,625
We do not allow cell phones in here.

459
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:21,387
I'm sorry. Forgot I had it.

460
00:31:21,553 --> 00:31:25,990
No, I really came to tell you that
our business deal has to be put on hold.

461
00:31:26,513 --> 00:31:29,471
You see, we can't afford
to be seen to do business with...

462
00:31:30,553 --> 00:31:32,430
...whatever it is you're accused of being.

463
00:31:32,593 --> 00:31:35,061
I'm sure a businessman of your stature
will understand.

464
00:31:35,233 --> 00:31:38,987
I think, Mr. Fox, a simple phone call
might have sufficed.

465
00:31:39,153 --> 00:31:42,384
Mr. Wayne didn't want you to think that
he was deliberately wasting your time.

466
00:31:42,553 --> 00:31:44,111
Just accidentally wasting it.

467
00:31:45,073 --> 00:31:49,066
That's very good, Mr. Lau.
"Accidentally." Very good.

468
00:31:49,833 --> 00:31:51,107
Hey, sir.

469
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,504
There's a better view
from the peak tram.

470
00:32:10,673 --> 00:32:12,425
How's the view from LSI Holdings?

471
00:32:12,713 --> 00:32:14,192
Restricted.

472
00:32:14,353 --> 00:32:16,264
Lau is holed up in there good and tight.

473
00:32:16,433 --> 00:32:18,264
-What's this?
-I had R&D work it up.

474
00:32:18,433 --> 00:32:20,025
Sends out a high-frequency pulse...

475
00:32:20,193 --> 00:32:22,912
...records the response time
for mapping an environment.

476
00:32:23,393 --> 00:32:25,861
Sonar. Just like a....

477
00:32:26,033 --> 00:32:28,103
Submarine, Mr. Wayne.
Like a submarine.

478
00:32:28,593 --> 00:32:30,345
-And the other device?
-It's in place.

479
00:32:31,233 --> 00:32:32,222
Mr. Wayne?

480
00:32:33,393 --> 00:32:34,621
Good luck.

481
00:36:15,193 --> 00:36:18,230
Look, give us the money
and we'll talk about making a deal.

482
00:36:18,393 --> 00:36:21,544
The money is the only reason
I'm still alive.

483
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:25,672
Oh, you mean, when they find out that
you've helped us, they're gonna kill you?

484
00:36:25,833 --> 00:36:27,471
-Are you threatening my client?
-No.

485
00:36:27,633 --> 00:36:31,672
I'm just assuming your client's
cooperation with this investigation.

486
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:34,825
As will everyone.

487
00:36:36,113 --> 00:36:39,310
No? Okay.

488
00:36:39,753 --> 00:36:42,631
Enjoy your time in County, Mr. Lau.

489
00:36:42,793 --> 00:36:44,226
Wait!

490
00:36:44,433 --> 00:36:46,344
I won't give you the money...

491
00:36:46,513 --> 00:36:49,391
...but I will give you my clients,
all of them.

492
00:36:49,673 --> 00:36:51,789
You were a glorified accountant.

493
00:36:51,953 --> 00:36:55,628
What could you possibly have
on all of them that we could charge?

494
00:36:55,793 --> 00:36:59,468
I'm good with calculation.
I handled all their investments.

495
00:36:59,633 --> 00:37:01,146
One big part.

496
00:37:02,473 --> 00:37:03,747
Got it.

497
00:37:04,153 --> 00:37:05,905
One minute.

498
00:37:06,673 --> 00:37:09,267
RICO. If they pooled their money...

499
00:37:09,433 --> 00:37:11,151
...we can charge them all
as one criminal conspiracy.

500
00:37:11,313 --> 00:37:12,428
Charge them with what?

501
00:37:12,593 --> 00:37:15,346
In a RICO case, if you can charge one
of the conspirators with a felony--

502
00:37:15,513 --> 00:37:17,981
You can charge all of them with it.
That's great.

503
00:37:19,313 --> 00:37:21,144
Mr. Lau.

504
00:37:22,113 --> 00:37:25,947
What kind of details do you have
about this communal fund?

505
00:37:26,113 --> 00:37:27,671
-Ledgers--?
-Immunity, protection...

506
00:37:27,833 --> 00:37:31,143
-...a chartered plane back to Hong Kong.
-After you testify in open court.

507
00:37:31,313 --> 00:37:33,543
And I'm just curious,
with all your clients locked up...

508
00:37:33,873 --> 00:37:35,989
...what's gonna happen
with all that money?

509
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:39,145
Like I said, I'm good with calculation.

510
00:37:39,313 --> 00:37:43,784
He can't go to County.
I'll keep him here in the holding cells.

511
00:37:43,953 --> 00:37:46,387
What is this, Gordon, your fortress?

512
00:37:46,673 --> 00:37:49,233
Well, you trust them over at County?

513
00:37:49,393 --> 00:37:51,145
I don't trust them here.

514
00:37:52,833 --> 00:37:54,266
Lau stays.

515
00:37:54,713 --> 00:37:57,181
Well, I don't know about
Mr. Lau's travel arrangements...

516
00:37:57,353 --> 00:37:59,071
...but I'm sure glad he's back.

517
00:37:59,233 --> 00:38:01,588
Put word out. We hire the clown.

518
00:38:04,273 --> 00:38:07,948
He was right.
We have to fix real problem.

519
00:38:08,433 --> 00:38:09,502
Batman.

520
00:38:13,873 --> 00:38:16,627
-I'm not aware of any participation by
the Batman in these investigations....

521
00:38:16,873 --> 00:38:17,627
Our boy looks good on the tube.

522
00:38:18,113 --> 00:38:20,752
You sure you wanna embarrass me
in front of my friends, Lieutenant?

523
00:38:20,913 --> 00:38:24,428
Oh, don't worry. They're coming too.

524
00:38:30,993 --> 00:38:32,745
Have a nice trip. See you next fall.

525
00:38:32,913 --> 00:38:34,665
Seven hundred twelve
counts of extortion.

526
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:37,142
Eight hundred and forty-nine
counts of racketeering.

527
00:38:37,313 --> 00:38:39,747
Two hundred and forty-six
counts of fraud.

528
00:38:39,913 --> 00:38:42,632
Eighty-seven counts
of conspiracy murder.

529
00:38:43,513 --> 00:38:46,505
Five hundred and twenty-seven
counts of obstruction of justice.

530
00:38:46,913 --> 00:38:48,232
How do the defendants plead?

531
00:38:55,113 --> 00:38:56,102
Order in the court.

532
00:38:56,273 --> 00:38:58,662
Five hundred and forty-nine
criminals at once.

533
00:38:58,833 --> 00:39:01,222
How did you convince Surrillo
to hear this farce?

534
00:39:01,393 --> 00:39:05,352
She shares my enthusiasm for justice.
After all, she is a judge.

535
00:39:05,513 --> 00:39:08,425
Well, even if you blow enough smoke
to get convictions out of Surrillo...

536
00:39:08,593 --> 00:39:11,061
...you're gonna set a new record at appeals
for the quickest kick in the ass.

537
00:39:11,233 --> 00:39:13,622
It won't matter.
The head guys make bail, sure.

538
00:39:13,793 --> 00:39:16,102
But the mid-level guys, they can't.

539
00:39:16,273 --> 00:39:18,025
They can't afford to be off the streets
long enough for trial and appeal.

540
00:39:18,193 --> 00:39:20,229
They'll cut deals that
include some jail time.

541
00:39:20,393 --> 00:39:23,271
Think of all you could do
with 18 months of clean streets.

542
00:39:24,753 --> 00:39:27,745
Mr. Mayor, you can't--
-No, get out. Both of you.

543
00:39:31,753 --> 00:39:33,232
Sit down.

544
00:39:37,993 --> 00:39:40,871
The public likes you. That's the
only reason that this might fly.

545
00:39:41,033 --> 00:39:42,307
But that means it's on you.

546
00:39:42,473 --> 00:39:45,385
They're all gonna come after you now,
and not just the Mob.

547
00:39:45,553 --> 00:39:49,228
Politicians, journalists, cops.

548
00:39:49,393 --> 00:39:51,782
Anyone whose wallet's
about to get lighter.

549
00:39:51,953 --> 00:39:54,513
Are you up to it? You'd better be.

550
00:39:54,673 --> 00:39:56,709
Because they get anything on you...

551
00:39:56,873 --> 00:40:01,469
...and those criminals are back on the
streets, followed swiftly by you and me.

552
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:02,861
Jesus!

553
00:40:23,153 --> 00:40:25,508
I think your fundraiser
will be a great success, sir.

554
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:28,233
And why do you think I wanna
hold a party for Harvey Dent?

555
00:40:28,393 --> 00:40:31,351
I assumed it was your usual reason
for socializing beyond myself...

556
00:40:31,513 --> 00:40:33,469
...and the scum of Gotham's underbelly:

557
00:40:33,633 --> 00:40:35,351
To try to impress Miss Dawes.

558
00:40:35,513 --> 00:40:39,426
Very droll, but very wrong.
Actually, it's Dent.

559
00:40:39,593 --> 00:40:42,346
Police released video
footage found concealed on the body.

560
00:40:42,513 --> 00:40:45,027
Sensitive viewers, be aware.
The image is disturbing.

561
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:47,309
Tell them your name.

562
00:40:47,473 --> 00:40:49,065
Brian Douglas.

563
00:40:50,593 --> 00:40:52,823
And are you the real Batman?

564
00:40:52,993 --> 00:40:53,982
No.
No?

565
00:40:54,153 --> 00:40:56,030
-No.
-No?

566
00:40:56,193 --> 00:40:57,831
Then why do you dress up like him?

567
00:40:59,313 --> 00:41:00,302
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

568
00:41:00,473 --> 00:41:04,386
Because he's a symbol that we
don't have to be afraid of scum like you.

569
00:41:04,553 --> 00:41:07,750
Yeah. You do, Brian. You really do.

570
00:41:07,913 --> 00:41:11,383
Huh? Yeah. Oh, shh, shh, shh.

571
00:41:11,553 --> 00:41:15,831
So you think Batman's
made Gotham a better place? Hm?

572
00:41:16,033 --> 00:41:17,512
Look at me.

573
00:41:17,673 --> 00:41:19,868
Look at me!

574
00:41:23,473 --> 00:41:26,829
You see, this is how crazy
Batman's made Gotham.

575
00:41:26,993 --> 00:41:29,188
You want order in Gotham...

576
00:41:29,513 --> 00:41:33,745
...Batman must take off his mask
and turn himself in.

577
00:41:33,913 --> 00:41:37,542
Oh, and every day he doesn't,
people will die.

578
00:41:37,873 --> 00:41:39,909
Starting tonight.

579
00:41:40,313 --> 00:41:42,429
I'm a man of my word.

580
00:41:58,993 --> 00:42:01,712
Harvey Dent,
scourge of the underworld...

581
00:42:01,873 --> 00:42:04,831
...scared stiff by the trust-fund brigade.

582
00:42:04,993 --> 00:42:06,187
-I'll be back.
-Rachel.

583
00:42:06,353 --> 00:42:09,072
A little liquid courage, Mr. Dent?

584
00:42:09,233 --> 00:42:11,542
-Thank you. Alfred, right?
-That's right, sir.

585
00:42:11,713 --> 00:42:14,864
Rachel talks about you all the time.
You've known her her whole life.

586
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:16,227
Not yet, sir.

587
00:42:18,433 --> 00:42:20,583
Any psychotic ex-boyfriends
I should be aware of?

588
00:42:20,753 --> 00:42:22,903
Oh, you have no idea.

589
00:42:41,073 --> 00:42:42,426
I'm sorry that I'm late.

590
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:44,868
I'm glad to see
that you all got started without me.

591
00:42:45,033 --> 00:42:48,582
Now, where is Harvey? Where--?

592
00:42:48,753 --> 00:42:51,062
Harvey Dent, the man of the hour.

593
00:42:51,233 --> 00:42:52,507
Where's Rachel Dawes?

594
00:42:52,673 --> 00:42:54,948
She is my oldest friend. Come here.

595
00:42:55,113 --> 00:42:57,502
You know, when Rachel first told me
that she was dating Harvey Dent...

596
00:42:57,673 --> 00:42:58,822
...I had one thing to say:

597
00:42:59,033 --> 00:43:01,342
The guy from those God-awful
campaign commercials?

598
00:43:01,513 --> 00:43:05,188
"I believe in Harvey Dent."
Yeah, nice slogan, Harvey.

599
00:43:05,353 --> 00:43:07,264
But it caught Rachel's attention.

600
00:43:07,433 --> 00:43:10,311
And then I started to pay attention
to Harvey...

601
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:13,864
...and all that he's been doing
as our new DA.

602
00:43:14,033 --> 00:43:15,751
And you know what?

603
00:43:17,713 --> 00:43:19,146
I believe in Harvey Dent.

604
00:43:19,313 --> 00:43:22,749
I believe that on his watch,
Gotham can feel...

605
00:43:22,913 --> 00:43:26,428
...a little safer, a little more optimistic.

606
00:43:27,793 --> 00:43:31,945
Look at this face. This is the face
of Gotham's bright future.

607
00:43:32,113 --> 00:43:34,183
To Harvey Dent. Let's hear it for him.

608
00:43:34,553 --> 00:43:36,032
Harvey.

609
00:43:45,153 --> 00:43:46,552
Harvey may not know you
well enough...

610
00:43:46,713 --> 00:43:48,590
...to understand when you're
making fun of him...

611
00:43:48,753 --> 00:43:50,664
-...but I do.
-No, I meant every word.

612
00:43:51,953 --> 00:43:54,751
You know that day
that you once told me about...

613
00:43:54,913 --> 00:43:56,904
...when Gotham would no longer
need Batman?

614
00:43:57,073 --> 00:43:58,904
-It's coming.
-Bruce.

615
00:43:59,713 --> 00:44:05,071
-You can't ask me to wait for that.
-It's happening now. Harvey is that hero.

616
00:44:05,233 --> 00:44:09,511
He locked up half of the city's criminals,
and he did it without wearing a mask.

617
00:44:09,673 --> 00:44:11,789
Gotham needs a hero with a face.

618
00:44:12,593 --> 00:44:14,788
You can throw a party, Wayne,
I'll give you that.

619
00:44:16,113 --> 00:44:17,944
Thanks again.

620
00:44:18,713 --> 00:44:20,351
You mind if I borrow Rachel?

621
00:44:23,673 --> 00:44:25,948
Lieutenant, that joker card
pinned to the body?

622
00:44:26,113 --> 00:44:27,785
Forensics found three sets of DNA.

623
00:44:27,953 --> 00:44:29,306
-Any matches?
-All three.

624
00:44:29,473 --> 00:44:32,829
The DNA belongs to Judge Surrillo,
Harvey Dent and Commissioner Loeb.

625
00:44:32,993 --> 00:44:34,904
The Joker's telling us
who he's targeting.

626
00:44:35,073 --> 00:44:37,826
Get a unit over to Surrillo's house.
Tell Wuertz to find Dent.

627
00:44:37,993 --> 00:44:39,949
Get them both into protective custody.
Where's the Commissioner?

628
00:44:40,113 --> 00:44:41,546
-City hall.
-Seal the building.

629
00:44:41,713 --> 00:44:43,624
-No one in or out till I get there.
-Got it.

630
00:44:55,433 --> 00:44:57,708
Gordon. What are you up to?

631
00:44:57,873 --> 00:45:00,990
We're secure. I want a floor-by-floor
search of the entire building.

632
00:45:01,153 --> 00:45:03,621
Sorry Sir, We believe the Joker's
made a threat against your life.

633
00:45:03,793 --> 00:45:05,146
These are dangerous people, Judge.

634
00:45:05,313 --> 00:45:06,985
Yea, but you're not giving me
an awful lot of information.

635
00:45:07,153 --> 00:45:09,030
Even we don't know
where you're going.

636
00:45:09,193 --> 00:45:12,390
Take the envelope, get in, open it.
It'll tell you where you're headed.

637
00:45:16,073 --> 00:45:17,904
You can not leave me alone
with these people.

638
00:45:18,073 --> 00:45:20,985
The whole Mob's after you
and you're worried about these guys?

639
00:45:21,153 --> 00:45:23,030
Yeah, compared to this,
the Mob doesn't scare me.

640
00:45:23,193 --> 00:45:26,629
Gordon, you're unlikely to discover this
for yourself, so...

641
00:45:26,793 --> 00:45:30,706
...take my word, the police Commissioner
earns a lot of threats.

642
00:45:30,873 --> 00:45:36,186
I found the appropriate response
to these situations a long time ago.

643
00:45:36,393 --> 00:45:38,543
Them gunning for you
makes you see things clearly.

644
00:45:38,713 --> 00:45:39,987
Yeah, I bet.

645
00:45:40,153 --> 00:45:44,271
Yeah. It makes you think about things
you couldn't stand losing...

646
00:45:44,433 --> 00:45:46,344
...about who you wanna spend the
rest of your life with.

647
00:45:46,513 --> 00:45:49,391
-That's a pretty big commitment.
-Well, not if the Mob has their way.

648
00:45:54,393 --> 00:45:56,987
You get to explain to my wife...

649
00:45:57,873 --> 00:45:59,386
...why I'm late for dinner, Lieutenant.

650
00:45:59,553 --> 00:46:02,590
Sir, the joker card
had traces of your DNA on it.

651
00:46:04,113 --> 00:46:06,627
-Don't do that.
-All right.

652
00:46:07,153 --> 00:46:09,951
-Let's be serious, then.
-Okay.

653
00:46:10,273 --> 00:46:11,262
What's your answer?

654
00:46:17,193 --> 00:46:18,626
I don't have an answer.

655
00:46:20,713 --> 00:46:21,702
How'd they get my DNA?

656
00:46:21,873 --> 00:46:23,943
Somebody with access
to your office or your house...

657
00:46:24,113 --> 00:46:26,627
...must have lifted a tissue
or a glass-- Wait! Wait! Wait!

658
00:46:26,793 --> 00:46:29,591
-Well, I guess no answer is a no.
-Harvey.

659
00:46:29,753 --> 00:46:31,789
-It's someone else, isn't it?
-Harvey.

660
00:46:31,953 --> 00:46:34,990
Just tell me it's not Wayne.
The guy's a complete f--

661
00:46:35,473 --> 00:46:36,872
What are you doing?

662
00:46:47,593 --> 00:46:48,582
Oh, shit.

663
00:46:54,513 --> 00:46:56,185
Get a medic!

664
00:46:59,473 --> 00:47:00,542
They've come for him.

665
00:47:01,993 --> 00:47:03,108
We made it.

666
00:47:05,593 --> 00:47:06,582
Stay hidden.

667
00:47:08,753 --> 00:47:11,950
Good evening, Ladies and Gentlemen.

668
00:47:14,753 --> 00:47:18,507
We are tonight's entertainment.

669
00:47:19,313 --> 00:47:21,543
I only have one question:

670
00:47:21,753 --> 00:47:25,143
Where is Harvey Dent?

671
00:47:34,233 --> 00:47:36,224
You know where Harvey is?
You know who he is?

672
00:47:36,393 --> 00:47:37,621
Hands up, pretty boy.

673
00:47:44,473 --> 00:47:47,146
Do you know where I can find Harvey?
I need to talk to him about something.

674
00:47:47,313 --> 00:47:50,032
Just something little, huh? No.

675
00:47:52,233 --> 00:47:54,872
What's going on out there? Wayne!

676
00:47:56,273 --> 00:47:57,592
Oh, thank God, you've
got a panic room.

677
00:47:57,753 --> 00:47:58,868
Hey, wait--

678
00:47:59,433 --> 00:48:01,151
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

679
00:48:01,433 --> 00:48:03,344
You know, I'll settle for his loved ones.

680
00:48:03,513 --> 00:48:06,869
We're not intimidated by thugs.

681
00:48:07,793 --> 00:48:09,431
You know...

682
00:48:10,993 --> 00:48:13,871
...you remind me of my father.

683
00:48:14,313 --> 00:48:16,065
I hated my father.

684
00:48:16,233 --> 00:48:18,189
Okay, stop.

685
00:48:21,873 --> 00:48:24,592
Well, hello, beautiful.

686
00:48:26,673 --> 00:48:30,348
You must be Harvey's squeeze. Hm?

687
00:48:30,713 --> 00:48:33,102
And you are beautiful.

688
00:48:39,753 --> 00:48:43,462
You look nervous. Is it the scars?

689
00:48:44,353 --> 00:48:46,469
You wanna know how I got them?

690
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:50,067
Come here. Hey.

691
00:48:50,433 --> 00:48:52,071
Look at me.

692
00:48:52,513 --> 00:48:57,064
So I had a wife.
She was beautiful, like you...

693
00:48:57,313 --> 00:49:01,352
...who tells me I worry too much...

694
00:49:01,513 --> 00:49:04,311
...who tells me I ought to smile more...

695
00:49:04,473 --> 00:49:09,752
...who gambles and gets in deep
with the sharks. Hey.

696
00:49:10,153 --> 00:49:12,462
One day they carve her face.

697
00:49:12,953 --> 00:49:17,026
And we have no money for surgeries.
She can't take it.

698
00:49:17,393 --> 00:49:20,749
I just wanna see her smile again. Hm?

699
00:49:21,073 --> 00:49:23,871
I just want her to know
that I don't care about the scars.

700
00:49:24,393 --> 00:49:25,872
So...

701
00:49:26,433 --> 00:49:29,948
...I stick a razor in my mouth
and do this...

702
00:49:30,393 --> 00:49:31,712
...to myself.

703
00:49:31,993 --> 00:49:36,862
And you know what?
She can't stand the sight of me.

704
00:49:37,033 --> 00:49:38,512
She leaves.

705
00:49:39,193 --> 00:49:41,502
Now I see the funny side.

706
00:49:42,353 --> 00:49:43,866
Now I'm always smiling.

707
00:49:47,153 --> 00:49:50,350
Got a little fight in you. I like that.

708
00:49:50,513 --> 00:49:51,787
Then you're gonna love me.

709
00:50:18,793 --> 00:50:19,942
Drop the gun.

710
00:50:20,113 --> 00:50:22,627
Oh, sure. You just take off
your little mask...

711
00:50:22,793 --> 00:50:24,909
...and show us all who
you really are. Hm?

712
00:50:30,313 --> 00:50:31,462
Let her go.

713
00:50:32,233 --> 00:50:33,586
Very poor choice of words.

714
00:50:55,473 --> 00:50:57,270
Are you all right?

715
00:50:59,433 --> 00:51:01,708
Let's not do that again.

716
00:51:01,993 --> 00:51:04,382
-Is Harvey okay?
-He's safe.

717
00:51:05,873 --> 00:51:07,147
Thank you.

718
00:51:07,473 --> 00:51:08,462
Jim, it's over.

719
00:51:08,633 --> 00:51:11,101
As long as they don't get to Lau,
we've cut off their funds.

720
00:51:11,273 --> 00:51:12,706
The prosecution's over.

721
00:51:12,873 --> 00:51:14,465
Nobody's standing up
in front of a judge...

722
00:51:14,633 --> 00:51:17,511
...while judges and police Commissioners
are getting blown away.

723
00:51:17,673 --> 00:51:19,391
-What about Dent?
-He's got any sense...

724
00:51:19,553 --> 00:51:20,588
...Dent's halfway to Mex--

725
00:51:20,753 --> 00:51:22,266
So where do you keep your trash?

726
00:51:23,553 --> 00:51:27,341
You're due in court. I need you alive
long enough to get you on the record.

727
00:51:27,513 --> 00:51:30,425
You can't protect me.
You can't even protect yourselves.

728
00:51:30,593 --> 00:51:33,790
You refuse to cooperate, you're not
coming back here, you go to County.

729
00:51:33,953 --> 00:51:36,308
How long do you calculate
you'll last in there?

730
00:51:37,673 --> 00:51:39,106
Targeting me won't get their money back.

731
00:51:39,273 --> 00:51:41,025
I knew the Mob wouldn't go
down without a fight...

732
00:51:41,193 --> 00:51:43,184
...but this is different.
They crossed a line.

733
00:51:43,353 --> 00:51:44,547
You crossed the line first, Sir.

734
00:51:44,713 --> 00:51:47,989
You squeezed them, you hammered them
to the point of desperation.

735
00:51:48,153 --> 00:51:52,943
And in their desperation, they turned to
a man they didn't fully understand.

736
00:51:53,433 --> 00:51:55,867
Criminals aren't complicated, Alfred.

737
00:51:56,033 --> 00:51:58,149
We just need to figure out
what he's after.

738
00:51:58,313 --> 00:51:59,666
With respect, Master Wayne...

739
00:51:59,833 --> 00:52:02,666
...perhaps this is a man
you don't fully understand either.

740
00:52:03,433 --> 00:52:06,027
A long time ago, I was in Burma...

741
00:52:06,193 --> 00:52:09,469
...and my friends and I were working
for the local government.

742
00:52:09,633 --> 00:52:12,101
They were trying to buy
the loyalty of tribal leaders...

743
00:52:12,273 --> 00:52:14,992
...by bribing them with
precious stones...

744
00:52:15,153 --> 00:52:19,544
...but their caravans were being raided
in a forest north of Rangoon by a bandit.

745
00:52:19,713 --> 00:52:22,864
So we went looking for the stones.

746
00:52:23,233 --> 00:52:28,148
But in six months, we never
met anyone who traded with him.

747
00:52:28,753 --> 00:52:32,587
One day, I saw a child
playing with a ruby...

748
00:52:32,753 --> 00:52:35,665
...the size of a tangerine.

749
00:52:35,913 --> 00:52:39,144
The bandit had been
throwing them away.

750
00:52:39,793 --> 00:52:42,387
-So why steal them?
-Well, because he thought it was good sport.

751
00:52:42,553 --> 00:52:47,308
Because some men aren't looking
for anything logical, like money.

752
00:52:47,473 --> 00:52:51,546
They can't be bought, bullied,
reasoned or negotiated with.

753
00:52:51,953 --> 00:52:55,628
Some men just wanna
watch the world burn.

754
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:16,348
Your name, sir?

755
00:53:16,513 --> 00:53:19,550
Eighth and Orchard.
You'll find Harvey Dent there.

756
00:53:31,913 --> 00:53:33,312
Check the names.

757
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:41,271
"Richard Dent."

758
00:53:43,393 --> 00:53:44,428
"Patrick Harvey."

759
00:53:44,713 --> 00:53:45,702
Harvey Dent.

760
00:53:45,873 --> 00:53:48,751
I need 10 minutes with the scene
before your men contaminate it.

761
00:53:48,953 --> 00:53:51,069
Us contaminate it?
It's because of you these guys are dead--

762
00:53:51,233 --> 00:53:52,712
Hey, Detective!

763
00:53:54,833 --> 00:53:56,789
Give us a minute, guys.

764
00:53:57,953 --> 00:53:59,466
That's brick underneath.

765
00:53:59,793 --> 00:54:01,385
Gonna take ballistics
off a shattered bullet?

766
00:54:01,553 --> 00:54:03,111
No.

767
00:54:04,513 --> 00:54:06,344
Fingerprints.

768
00:54:14,553 --> 00:54:16,384
Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast.

769
00:54:18,113 --> 00:54:22,629
Because we found his next target.
He's put it in tomorrow's paper.

770
00:54:39,233 --> 00:54:41,428
I'm not sure
you made it loud enough, Sir.

771
00:54:53,993 --> 00:54:56,029
What can I do for you, Mr. Reese?

772
00:54:56,193 --> 00:54:59,822
You wanted me to do the diligence
on the LSI Holdings deal again.

773
00:55:00,473 --> 00:55:02,668
Well, I found some irregularities.

774
00:55:03,073 --> 00:55:05,064
Their CEO is in police custody.

775
00:55:05,233 --> 00:55:08,031
No, not with their numbers, with yours.

776
00:55:08,233 --> 00:55:11,191
Applied Sciences. Whole division
of Wayne Enterprises...

777
00:55:11,353 --> 00:55:12,945
...just disappeared overnight.

778
00:55:13,113 --> 00:55:17,186
I went down to the archives
and I started pulling some old files.

779
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:20,070
Don't tell me you didn't
recognize your baby out there...

780
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:23,703
...pancaking cop cars
on the evening news.

781
00:55:23,993 --> 00:55:27,065
Now you got the entire R&D
Department burning through cash...

782
00:55:27,233 --> 00:55:30,430
...claiming it's related to
cell phones for the Army?

783
00:55:30,593 --> 00:55:33,551
What are you building for him now,
a rocket ship?

784
00:55:35,353 --> 00:55:37,025
I want...

785
00:55:37,193 --> 00:55:40,947
...10 million dollars a year
for the rest of my life.

786
00:55:43,353 --> 00:55:45,389
Let me get this straight.

787
00:55:46,553 --> 00:55:48,908
You think that your client...

788
00:55:49,073 --> 00:55:52,031
One of the wealthiest,
most powerful men in the world...

789
00:55:52,193 --> 00:55:53,706
...is secretly a vigilante...

790
00:55:53,873 --> 00:55:58,344
...who spends his nights beating
criminals to a pulp with his bare hands...

791
00:55:58,513 --> 00:56:01,550
...and your plan
is to blackmail this person?

792
00:56:08,713 --> 00:56:09,941
Good luck.

793
00:56:12,713 --> 00:56:14,066
Well--

794
00:56:15,433 --> 00:56:16,832
Keep that.

795
00:56:23,233 --> 00:56:25,588
This is your original scan.

796
00:56:26,953 --> 00:56:29,148
Here it is re-engineered.

797
00:56:37,033 --> 00:56:40,423
And there's the thumbprint he left
when he pushed the round in the clip.

798
00:56:42,353 --> 00:56:43,468
I'll get you a copy.

799
00:56:43,673 --> 00:56:47,302
Mr. Wayne, did you reassign R&D?

800
00:56:47,473 --> 00:56:49,862
Yeah. Government
telecommunications project.

801
00:56:50,033 --> 00:56:51,989
I wasn't aware
we had any government contracts.

802
00:56:52,233 --> 00:56:55,111
Lucius, I'm playing this one
pretty close to the chest.

803
00:56:56,193 --> 00:56:57,831
Fair enough.

804
00:57:00,633 --> 00:57:02,032
With no word from the Batman...

805
00:57:02,193 --> 00:57:03,626
...even as they mourn
Commissioner Loeb...

806
00:57:03,793 --> 00:57:07,024
...these cops have to be wondering if
the Joker will make good on his threat...

807
00:57:07,193 --> 00:57:10,265
...in the obituary column of
The Gotham Times to kill the mayor.

808
00:57:11,993 --> 00:57:15,508
I've checked all the databases.
There are four possibles.

809
00:57:15,673 --> 00:57:17,709
Cross-reference the addresses.

810
00:57:17,873 --> 00:57:21,707
Look for Parkside,
overlooking the parade.

811
00:57:22,873 --> 00:57:23,942
I got one.

812
00:57:24,113 --> 00:57:27,947
Melvin White,
1502 Randolph Apartments.

813
00:57:28,313 --> 00:57:32,226
Aggravated assault,
moved to Arkham twice.

814
00:58:09,713 --> 00:58:11,226
What do you got on the roof?

815
00:58:11,393 --> 00:58:14,783
We're tight, but frankly,
there's a lot of windows up here.

816
00:58:22,993 --> 00:58:26,872
Commissioner Loeb dedicated his life
to law enforcement...

817
00:58:27,033 --> 00:58:29,228
...and to the protection
of his community.

818
00:58:29,393 --> 00:58:31,111
I remember when I first took office...

819
00:58:31,273 --> 00:58:33,707
...and I asked if he wanted
to stay on as Commissioner.

820
00:58:33,873 --> 00:58:38,901
And he said he would, provided
I kept my politics out of his office.

821
00:58:42,513 --> 00:58:45,550
Clearly he was not a man who minced
words, nor should he have been.

822
00:58:46,673 --> 00:58:50,029
A number of policies that he enacted
as Commissioner were unpopular.

823
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:53,310
Policies that flooded my office
with angry calls and letters....

824
00:58:57,513 --> 00:58:59,105
-Who's that?
-What happened?

825
00:59:00,113 --> 00:59:01,910
They took our guns.

826
00:59:02,073 --> 00:59:03,791
And our uniforms.

827
00:59:10,113 --> 00:59:12,752
And as we recognize
the sacrifice of this man...

828
00:59:12,913 --> 00:59:16,701
...we must remember that vigilance
is the price of safety.

829
00:59:16,873 --> 00:59:19,262
Stand by. Honor guard.

830
00:59:19,433 --> 00:59:22,903
Attention. Port arms.

831
00:59:24,073 --> 00:59:28,271
Ready! Aim! Fire!

832
00:59:29,033 --> 00:59:30,512
Ready! Aim!

833
00:59:33,993 --> 00:59:36,268
Ready! Aim!

834
00:59:44,353 --> 00:59:45,706
Stay down! Don't move!

835
00:59:47,473 --> 00:59:49,065
Mr. Mayor. Get him out of here.

836
00:59:57,913 --> 01:00:00,063
-I'll see you later.
-Why are you going back?

837
01:00:12,193 --> 01:00:13,182
Get out of here.

838
01:00:17,073 --> 01:00:18,745
Tell me what you know about the Joker.

839
01:00:48,513 --> 01:00:49,787
No.

840
01:00:50,193 --> 01:00:51,467
I'm sorry, Barbara.

841
01:00:52,353 --> 01:00:55,470
Jimmy, go play with your sister.
Go ahead, honey.

842
01:00:55,633 --> 01:00:57,783
If there's anything
we can do, anything you need...

843
01:00:57,953 --> 01:00:59,625
...we're here for you.

844
01:01:01,153 --> 01:01:02,984
Shh.

845
01:01:03,153 --> 01:01:04,347
Are you out there?

846
01:01:05,633 --> 01:01:09,945
Are you? You brought this
craziness on us. You did!

847
01:01:10,113 --> 01:01:12,388
You brought this on us!

848
01:01:13,393 --> 01:01:17,784
Switch it off, he ain't coming.
He doesn't wanna talk to us.

849
01:01:18,193 --> 01:01:21,071
God help whoever
he does wanna talk to.

850
01:01:22,673 --> 01:01:25,471
Can't we go someplace quieter?
We can't hear each other talk.

851
01:01:25,633 --> 01:01:28,352
What makes you think
I wanna hear you talk?

852
01:01:28,513 --> 01:01:29,502
What?

853
01:01:57,713 --> 01:01:59,271
-Yeah?
Second.

854
01:01:59,433 --> 01:02:00,422
Okay.

855
01:02:00,593 --> 01:02:02,663
-Harvey, where are you?
Where are you?

856
01:02:02,833 --> 01:02:04,869
I'm where you should be,
at Major Crimes.

857
01:02:05,033 --> 01:02:06,512
-I'm trying to deal with all of this mess.
-Rachel.

858
01:02:06,673 --> 01:02:07,609
-Can I get the fingerprint analysis?

859
01:02:07,625 --> 01:02:10,109
-Rachel. Rachel, listen to me. You're not safe there.

860
01:02:10,273 --> 01:02:11,991
-Oh, this is Gordon's unit.
-Gordon's gone, Rachel.

861
01:02:12,153 --> 01:02:15,589
He vouched for these men.
-And he's gone.

862
01:02:20,033 --> 01:02:22,024
The Joker's named you next.

863
01:02:22,193 --> 01:02:25,071
God, is there someone, is there anyone
in this town we can trust?

864
01:02:25,233 --> 01:02:26,871
Bruce.

865
01:02:27,153 --> 01:02:28,268
We can trust Bruce Wayne.

866
01:02:28,433 --> 01:02:29,946
No. Rachel, c'mon, I know
you're his friend, but--

867
01:02:30,113 --> 01:02:31,865
Harvey, trust me.

868
01:02:32,033 --> 01:02:34,672
Bruce's penthouse is now
the safest place in the city.

869
01:02:34,833 --> 01:02:36,107
Then you go straight there.

870
01:02:36,273 --> 01:02:38,309
You don't tell anybody where you
are going and I'll find you there.

871
01:02:38,473 --> 01:02:40,111
I love you.

872
01:02:53,553 --> 01:02:54,747
I want the Joker.

873
01:02:55,913 --> 01:02:57,505
From one professional to another...

874
01:02:57,673 --> 01:03:00,107
...if you're trying to scare somebody,
pick a better spot.

875
01:03:00,273 --> 01:03:02,741
From this height,
the fall wouldn't kill me.

876
01:03:02,913 --> 01:03:04,426
-I'm counting on it.
-Huh!

877
01:03:11,513 --> 01:03:14,505
-Where is he?
-I don't know where he is. He found us.

878
01:03:14,673 --> 01:03:15,901
He must have friends.

879
01:03:16,233 --> 01:03:18,428
Friends? Have you met this guy?

880
01:03:18,593 --> 01:03:20,106
Someone knows where he is.

881
01:03:20,273 --> 01:03:22,662
Nobody's gonna tell you nothing.

882
01:03:22,833 --> 01:03:24,107
They're wise to your act.

883
01:03:24,273 --> 01:03:28,107
You got rules.
The Joker, he's got no rules.

884
01:03:28,273 --> 01:03:32,949
Nobody's gonna cross him for you.
If you want this guy, you got one way.

885
01:03:33,113 --> 01:03:34,831
But you already know what that is.

886
01:03:34,993 --> 01:03:37,666
Just take off that mask,
let him come find you.

887
01:03:39,233 --> 01:03:43,146
Or you can let a couple more people
get killed while you make up your mind.

888
01:03:44,753 --> 01:03:46,664
You wanna play games?

889
01:03:52,713 --> 01:03:53,702
How's that feel?

890
01:03:53,873 --> 01:03:56,387
-You wouldn't.
-I wouldn't!

891
01:03:57,833 --> 01:03:59,391
-You don't think I will?
-Mm-mm.

892
01:03:59,553 --> 01:04:01,509
-You don't think I will?
-Mm-mm.

893
01:04:02,833 --> 01:04:05,905
No. No, I wouldn't.

894
01:04:07,073 --> 01:04:09,507
That's why I'm not
gonna leave it up to me.

895
01:04:10,473 --> 01:04:13,351
Heads, you get to keep your head.

896
01:04:13,753 --> 01:04:15,311
Tails...

897
01:04:16,233 --> 01:04:17,222
...not so lucky.

898
01:04:17,593 --> 01:04:20,983
So you wanna tell me about the Joker?

899
01:04:29,993 --> 01:04:33,542
-Let's go again.
-I don't know anything! I don't!

900
01:04:33,713 --> 01:04:35,988
You're not playing the odds, friend.

901
01:04:37,073 --> 01:04:38,984
Let's do it again.

902
01:04:41,713 --> 01:04:43,465
You'd leave a man's life to chance?

903
01:04:44,193 --> 01:04:47,629
-Not exactly.
-His name's Schiff, Thomas.

904
01:04:47,793 --> 01:04:50,671
He's a paranoid schizophrenic,
former patient at Arkham.

905
01:04:50,833 --> 01:04:55,270
The kind of mind the Joker attracts.
What do you expect to learn from him?

906
01:04:58,473 --> 01:05:01,146
The Joker killed Gordon.
He's gonna kill Rachel.

907
01:05:01,313 --> 01:05:03,986
You're the symbol of hope
I could never be.

908
01:05:04,153 --> 01:05:05,905
Your stand against organized crime...

909
01:05:06,073 --> 01:05:09,145
...is the first legitimate ray of light
in Gotham in decades.

910
01:05:09,313 --> 01:05:12,783
If anyone saw this,
everything would be undone.

911
01:05:12,953 --> 01:05:15,148
All the criminals you pulled off the
streets would be released...

912
01:05:15,313 --> 01:05:18,271
...and Jim Gordon
will have died for nothing.

913
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:21,023
You're gonna hold a press
conference tomorrow morning.

914
01:05:21,193 --> 01:05:23,468
-Why?
-No one else will die because of me.

915
01:05:23,633 --> 01:05:25,863
Gotham's in your hands now.

916
01:05:26,033 --> 01:05:27,671
You can't.

917
01:05:27,833 --> 01:05:29,152
You can't give in.

918
01:05:29,433 --> 01:05:31,867
You can't give in!

919
01:05:46,593 --> 01:05:47,787
Harvey called.

920
01:05:47,953 --> 01:05:50,865
He said Batman's gonna turn himself in.

921
01:05:51,033 --> 01:05:52,102
I have no choice.

922
01:05:52,273 --> 01:05:55,231
You honestly think that's gonna
keep the Joker from killing people?

923
01:05:55,393 --> 01:05:58,703
Maybe not. But I have enough
blood on my hands.

924
01:05:59,153 --> 01:06:03,783
And I've seen now, what I would
have to become to stop men like him.

925
01:06:04,313 --> 01:06:07,623
You once told me that
if the day came when I was finished...

926
01:06:07,793 --> 01:06:09,784
...that we'd be together.

927
01:06:10,473 --> 01:06:13,510
Bruce, don't make me
your one hope for a normal life.

928
01:06:14,993 --> 01:06:16,267
Did you mean it?

929
01:06:17,713 --> 01:06:19,465
Yes.

930
01:06:36,033 --> 01:06:37,751
Bruce.

931
01:06:38,673 --> 01:06:42,427
If you turn yourself in,
they're not gonna let us be together.

932
01:06:52,633 --> 01:06:55,466
Logs as well?
Everything.

933
01:06:55,633 --> 01:06:58,864
Anything that could lead back
to Lucius or Rachel.

934
01:07:03,993 --> 01:07:07,144
People are dying, Alfred.
What would you have me do?

935
01:07:07,313 --> 01:07:10,908
Endure, Master Wayne. Take it.

936
01:07:11,073 --> 01:07:14,622
They'll hate you for it,
but that's the point of Batman.

937
01:07:14,793 --> 01:07:20,106
He can be the outcast. He can make
the choice that no one else can make.

938
01:07:20,273 --> 01:07:21,547
The right choice.

939
01:07:22,033 --> 01:07:24,945
No, today I found out
what Batman can't do.

940
01:07:25,113 --> 01:07:26,307
He can't endure this.

941
01:07:26,593 --> 01:07:29,346
Today you get to say "I told you so."

942
01:07:29,913 --> 01:07:32,950
Today, I don't want to.

943
01:07:38,553 --> 01:07:39,952
But I did bloody tell you.

944
01:07:42,873 --> 01:07:45,751
I suppose they're gonna
lock me up as well...

945
01:07:46,513 --> 01:07:47,707
...as your accomplice.

946
01:07:47,873 --> 01:07:52,424
Accomplice? I'm gonna tell them
the whole thing was your idea.

947
01:07:56,513 --> 01:07:58,513
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming.

948
01:07:58,513 --> 01:07:59,903
I've called this press conference for two reasons.

949
01:08:00,073 --> 01:08:02,029
Firstly, to assure the citizens
of Gotham...

950
01:08:02,193 --> 01:08:05,708
...that everything that can be done
over the Joker killings is being done.

951
01:08:07,033 --> 01:08:09,991
Secondly, because the Batman
has offered to turn himself in.

952
01:08:10,153 --> 01:08:11,791
But first, let's consider the situation.

953
01:08:12,153 --> 01:08:14,667
Should we give in
to this terrorist's demands?

954
01:08:14,833 --> 01:08:16,232
Do we really think he's gonna--?

955
01:08:16,393 --> 01:08:19,624
You'd rather protect an outlaw vigilante
than the lives of citizens?

956
01:08:19,793 --> 01:08:22,068
The Batman is an outlaw.

957
01:08:22,913 --> 01:08:24,744
But, that's not why we
demand he turn himself in...

958
01:08:24,913 --> 01:08:26,505
...we're doing it because we're scared.

959
01:08:26,673 --> 01:08:29,346
We've been happy to let the Batman
clean up our streets for us until now.

960
01:08:29,513 --> 01:08:32,346
Things are worse than ever!
Amen.

961
01:08:33,633 --> 01:08:35,464
Yes, they are.

962
01:08:37,873 --> 01:08:40,751
But the night is darkest
just before the dawn.

963
01:08:43,113 --> 01:08:45,104
And I promise you...

964
01:08:45,873 --> 01:08:47,226
...the dawn is coming.

965
01:08:47,393 --> 01:08:51,750
One day, the Batman will have to answer
for the laws he's broken. But to us...

966
01:08:51,913 --> 01:08:53,585
...not to this madman.

967
01:08:53,753 --> 01:08:55,983
-No more dead cops!
Yeah!

968
01:08:59,153 --> 01:09:00,666
He should turn himself in!

969
01:09:00,833 --> 01:09:03,427
Give us the Batman! Come on!
Where is he?

970
01:09:06,193 --> 01:09:08,263
So be it. Take the Batman into custody.

971
01:09:08,713 --> 01:09:10,590
What?
Is he here?

972
01:09:11,273 --> 01:09:12,262
I am the Batman.

973
01:09:12,593 --> 01:09:15,471
What?
Come on.

974
01:09:23,513 --> 01:09:25,344
Alfred.

975
01:09:26,633 --> 01:09:28,351
Why is he letting Harvey do this?

976
01:09:28,513 --> 01:09:31,391
-He went down to the press conference.
-I know. He just stood by.

977
01:09:31,553 --> 01:09:33,544
Perhaps both Bruce and Mr. Dent...

978
01:09:33,713 --> 01:09:36,591
...believe that Batman stands for
something more important...

979
01:09:36,753 --> 01:09:38,983
...than the whims of a terrorist,
Miss Dawes...

980
01:09:39,153 --> 01:09:41,064
...even if everyone hates him for it.

981
01:09:41,233 --> 01:09:43,269
That's the sacrifice he's making.

982
01:09:43,433 --> 01:09:46,903
He's not being a hero.
He's being something more.

983
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:48,991
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

984
01:09:49,153 --> 01:09:52,111
Letting Harvey take the fall for this
is not heroic at all.

985
01:09:54,673 --> 01:09:56,231
You know him better than anyone.

986
01:09:56,633 --> 01:09:57,622
I do.

987
01:10:00,873 --> 01:10:03,785
Will you give this to him for me?
When the time is right?

988
01:10:05,193 --> 01:10:06,342
How will I know?

989
01:10:06,513 --> 01:10:07,946
It's not sealed.

990
01:10:09,313 --> 01:10:10,792
Goodbye, Alfred.

991
01:10:14,793 --> 01:10:16,465
Bye, Rachel.

992
01:10:24,033 --> 01:10:25,785
Sorry, I didn't have time to talk
this through with you.

993
01:10:25,953 --> 01:10:27,147
What are you doing?

994
01:10:27,313 --> 01:10:29,304
They're transferring me
to Central Holding.

995
01:10:29,593 --> 01:10:33,108
This is the Joker's chance, and when he
attacks, the Batman will take him down.

996
01:10:33,173 --> 01:10:34,752
Listen to me. This is too dangerous.

997
01:10:34,913 --> 01:10:36,462
We get this guy to County,
he's their problem.

998
01:10:36,462 --> 01:10:38,462
Streets will be
cleared along your route...

999
01:10:38,633 --> 01:10:42,182
...so let's go.
Convoy stops for no reason.

1000
01:10:42,353 --> 01:10:43,752
I hope you got some moves, pal.

1001
01:10:43,913 --> 01:10:46,711
He's using you as bait. He doesn't
even know if he can get the Joker.

1002
01:10:46,873 --> 01:10:47,908
He's failed so far.

1003
01:10:48,233 --> 01:10:49,712
How do you know
what he's thinking?

1004
01:10:49,873 --> 01:10:52,103
I just... I do. Anyway, Harvey,
this isn't just about you.

1005
01:10:52,273 --> 01:10:54,025
What about all of the people
who are depending on you...

1006
01:10:54,193 --> 01:10:57,071
...to clean the city up
and do it honorably and--?

1007
01:11:02,513 --> 01:11:05,027
Harvey. Tell everyone the truth.

1008
01:11:05,393 --> 01:11:07,190
Heads, I go through with it.

1009
01:11:07,393 --> 01:11:11,224
This is your life. You can't leave
something like that to chance.

1010
01:11:11,893 --> 01:11:12,368
I'm not.

1011
01:11:15,833 --> 01:11:18,142
You make your own luck.

1012
01:11:39,073 --> 01:11:40,984
Hey, you wait like everybody else, pal.

1013
01:11:48,313 --> 01:11:50,543
What the hell is that?

1014
01:11:50,713 --> 01:11:52,829
Obstruction ahead, obstruction ahead!

1015
01:11:52,993 --> 01:11:56,065
Damn it! All units divert down
onto Lower Fifth. I repeat, exit down.

1016
01:11:56,473 --> 01:11:57,542
Exit down!

1017
01:11:57,713 --> 01:11:59,943
Lower Fifth? We'll be like turkeys
on Thanksgiving down there.

1018
01:12:31,313 --> 01:12:33,543
Jesus. Come on, get us out of here.
Let's go.

1019
01:12:35,633 --> 01:12:37,908
Listen, we need backup.
We've got company.

1020
01:12:38,073 --> 01:12:39,552
We got trouble, guys.

1021
01:12:42,353 --> 01:12:43,388
Lock and load!

1022
01:12:54,153 --> 01:12:55,472
What the hell was that?

1023
01:13:16,433 --> 01:13:18,993
-These things are built for that, right?
-He's gonna need something...

1024
01:13:19,153 --> 01:13:20,871
...a lot bigger to get through this.

1025
01:13:21,873 --> 01:13:23,272
What is that?

1026
01:13:24,553 --> 01:13:25,827
What is that, a bazooka?

1027
01:13:34,113 --> 01:13:35,751
I didn't sign up for this!

1028
01:13:51,433 --> 01:13:52,707
Look out.

1029
01:13:53,473 --> 01:13:54,588
Look out!

1030
01:14:02,553 --> 01:14:03,542
Hmm.

1031
01:14:15,953 --> 01:14:17,022
Come on, let's go!

1032
01:15:01,713 --> 01:15:03,829
Harvey, Harvey, Harvey Dent.

1033
01:15:03,993 --> 01:15:06,712
Oh, excuse me. I wanna drive.

1034
01:15:11,433 --> 01:15:14,869
Scanning all systems.
Scanning all systems.

1035
01:15:22,033 --> 01:15:24,069
We gotta get topside.
We need air support, now!

1036
01:15:29,353 --> 01:15:31,150
I like this job. I like it.

1037
01:15:33,313 --> 01:15:35,827
Damage catastrophic.
Eject sequence initiated.

1038
01:15:49,233 --> 01:15:50,666
Goodbye.

1039
01:15:59,393 --> 01:16:02,465
We're on point, ready to give them
some of their own medicine.

1040
01:16:08,593 --> 01:16:10,948
That's what I'm talking about. Air cav.

1041
01:16:23,953 --> 01:16:25,591
Okay, rack them up.

1042
01:16:25,753 --> 01:16:28,028
Rack them up, rack them up,
rack them up.

1043
01:16:52,713 --> 01:16:53,828
That's not good.

1044
01:16:57,193 --> 01:16:58,342
Okay, that's not good!

1045
01:17:39,713 --> 01:17:41,704
Now, there's a Batman.

1046
01:17:45,833 --> 01:17:46,982
Ooh, you wanna play. Come on.

1047
01:17:49,793 --> 01:17:50,862
Come on.

1048
01:17:59,633 --> 01:18:00,827
He missed!

1049
01:18:14,193 --> 01:18:16,502
You can't stop here.
We're like sitting ducks!

1050
01:18:32,833 --> 01:18:33,868
Come on, come on.

1051
01:18:36,873 --> 01:18:40,104
Come on. Come on. I want you to do it,
I want you to do it. Come on!

1052
01:18:42,553 --> 01:18:43,952
Come on.

1053
01:18:44,593 --> 01:18:47,790
Come on, come on. I want you to do it,
I want you to do it. Come on, hit me.

1054
01:18:47,953 --> 01:18:49,511
Come on, hit me. Come on, hit me!

1055
01:18:51,553 --> 01:18:52,542
Hit me!

1056
01:19:16,513 --> 01:19:19,630
Come on. Aah!

1057
01:19:19,793 --> 01:19:21,943
Could you please just give me a minute?

1058
01:19:23,953 --> 01:19:25,705
We got you, you son of a bitch.

1059
01:19:28,873 --> 01:19:32,627
Gor-- You do like to play things
pretty close to the chest.

1060
01:19:33,073 --> 01:19:34,711
We got him, Harvey.

1061
01:19:34,873 --> 01:19:38,183
Mr. Dent! How does it feel
to be the biggest hero in Gotham?

1062
01:19:38,353 --> 01:19:41,504
No, I'm no hero.
Gotham's finest, they're the heroes.

1063
01:19:41,673 --> 01:19:42,947
But you and your office...

1064
01:19:43,113 --> 01:19:44,705
...have been working
with the Batman all along.

1065
01:19:44,873 --> 01:19:46,591
No, but I trusted him
to do the right thing.

1066
01:19:46,753 --> 01:19:48,744
Which was?
-Saving my ass.

1067
01:19:48,913 --> 01:19:51,711
All right, people, that's enough.
Let him be. Let him be.

1068
01:19:51,873 --> 01:19:53,704
Thank you, Detective.

1069
01:19:53,913 --> 01:19:55,949
I've got a date
with a pretty upset girlfriend.

1070
01:19:56,113 --> 01:19:58,388
-I figured, counselor.
Mr. Dent, sir...

1071
01:19:58,553 --> 01:20:02,512
-...how about one for the front page, sir?
Mr. Dent.

1072
01:20:13,393 --> 01:20:16,430
Stand away! All of you!

1073
01:20:16,593 --> 01:20:19,949
I don't want anything for his Mob lawyer
to use, you understand?

1074
01:20:22,113 --> 01:20:23,910
Back from the dead.

1075
01:20:24,553 --> 01:20:26,032
I, uh...

1076
01:20:26,193 --> 01:20:28,024
...couldn't risk my family's safety.

1077
01:20:29,273 --> 01:20:31,025
What do we got?

1078
01:20:32,633 --> 01:20:36,421
Nothing. No matches on prints,
DNA, dental.

1079
01:20:36,593 --> 01:20:39,232
Clothing is custom, no labels.

1080
01:20:39,433 --> 01:20:41,469
Nothing in his pockets
but knives and lint.

1081
01:20:41,633 --> 01:20:43,464
No name.

1082
01:20:43,793 --> 01:20:45,670
-No other alias.
Go home, Gordon.

1083
01:20:45,833 --> 01:20:48,791
The clown'll keep till morning.
Go get some rest.

1084
01:20:48,953 --> 01:20:50,705
You're gonna need it.

1085
01:20:50,953 --> 01:20:53,421
Tomorrow you take the big job.

1086
01:20:54,073 --> 01:20:57,110
You don't have any say in the matter.
Commissioner Gordon.

1087
01:21:12,313 --> 01:21:14,349
I'm sorry, I couldn't risk your safety.

1088
01:21:20,593 --> 01:21:21,946
Look at these ugly bastards.

1089
01:21:22,113 --> 01:21:23,910
-I don't feel good.
You're a cop killer.

1090
01:21:24,073 --> 01:21:26,303
You're lucky to be feeling anything
below the neck.

1091
01:21:26,473 --> 01:21:27,986
-Please!
-Step away from the bars!

1092
01:21:28,153 --> 01:21:30,223
My insides hurt.

1093
01:21:43,833 --> 01:21:45,551
Did Batman save you, Daddy?

1094
01:21:47,633 --> 01:21:49,828
Actually, this time...

1095
01:21:49,993 --> 01:21:52,063
...I saved him.

1096
01:22:02,953 --> 01:22:04,511
Has he said anything yet?

1097
01:22:11,793 --> 01:22:15,832
Evening, Commissioner.

1098
01:22:23,153 --> 01:22:25,269
Harvey Dent never made it home.

1099
01:22:25,433 --> 01:22:27,469
-Of course not.
-What have you done with him?

1100
01:22:28,353 --> 01:22:30,025
Me?

1101
01:22:31,593 --> 01:22:33,629
I was right here.

1102
01:22:34,993 --> 01:22:36,745
Who did you leave him with?

1103
01:22:36,913 --> 01:22:39,632
Hm? Your people?

1104
01:22:40,713 --> 01:22:43,910
Assuming, of course,
that they are still your people...

1105
01:22:44,073 --> 01:22:46,667
...and not Maroni's.

1106
01:22:48,793 --> 01:22:51,068
Does it depress you, Commissioner...

1107
01:22:51,473 --> 01:22:56,228
...to know just how alone you really are?

1108
01:22:58,153 --> 01:23:02,829
Does it make you feel responsible
for Harvey Dent's current predicament?

1109
01:23:02,993 --> 01:23:05,553
-Where is he?
-What's the time?

1110
01:23:06,033 --> 01:23:07,466
What difference does that make?

1111
01:23:07,713 --> 01:23:12,946
Well, depending on the time,
he may be in one spot or several.

1112
01:23:19,073 --> 01:23:21,906
-If we're gonna play games...
-Mm-hm?

1113
01:23:24,953 --> 01:23:26,830
...I'm gonna need a cup of coffee.

1114
01:23:26,993 --> 01:23:30,906
Ah, the "good cop, bad cop" routine?

1115
01:23:31,553 --> 01:23:32,542
Not exactly.

1116
01:23:42,633 --> 01:23:46,512
Never start with the head. The victim
gets all fuzzy. He can't feel the next--

1117
01:23:49,553 --> 01:23:50,622
See?

1118
01:23:50,793 --> 01:23:53,023
You wanted me. Here I am.

1119
01:23:54,033 --> 01:23:56,069
I wanted to see what you'd do.

1120
01:23:56,593 --> 01:23:59,061
And you didn't disappoint.

1121
01:23:59,233 --> 01:24:01,952
You let five people die.

1122
01:24:02,873 --> 01:24:06,388
Then you let Dent take your place.

1123
01:24:06,553 --> 01:24:09,067
-Even to a guy like me, that's cold.
-Where's Dent?

1124
01:24:09,233 --> 01:24:13,829
Those Mob fools want you gone so they
can get back to the way things were.

1125
01:24:14,313 --> 01:24:18,864
But I know the truth. There's no
going back. You've changed things.

1126
01:24:19,033 --> 01:24:21,342
-Forever.
-Then why do you wanna kill me?

1127
01:24:24,193 --> 01:24:25,546
I don't wanna kill you.

1128
01:24:26,033 --> 01:24:30,390
What would I do without you? Go back
to ripping off Mob dealers? No, no.

1129
01:24:30,553 --> 01:24:32,828
No. No, you....

1130
01:24:32,993 --> 01:24:35,302
You complete me.

1131
01:24:35,473 --> 01:24:39,625
-You're garbage who kills for money.
-Don't talk like one of them. You're not.

1132
01:24:39,793 --> 01:24:42,102
Even if you'd like to be.

1133
01:24:43,313 --> 01:24:45,065
To them, you're just a freak...

1134
01:24:45,953 --> 01:24:47,227
...like me.

1135
01:24:47,393 --> 01:24:49,588
They need you right now...

1136
01:24:50,153 --> 01:24:52,109
...but when they don't...

1137
01:24:52,633 --> 01:24:55,545
...they'll cast you out like a leper.

1138
01:24:55,713 --> 01:24:59,467
You see, their morals, their code...

1139
01:24:59,713 --> 01:25:01,783
...it's a bad joke.

1140
01:25:02,033 --> 01:25:05,230
Dropped at the first sign of trouble.

1141
01:25:05,873 --> 01:25:09,707
They're only as good as the world
allows them to be. I'll show you.

1142
01:25:09,873 --> 01:25:12,910
When the chips are down, these--

1143
01:25:13,073 --> 01:25:15,223
These civilized people...

1144
01:25:15,393 --> 01:25:17,384
...they'll eat each other.

1145
01:25:18,073 --> 01:25:20,348
See, I'm not a monster.

1146
01:25:21,673 --> 01:25:22,901
I'm just ahead of the curve.

1147
01:25:25,073 --> 01:25:26,108
Where's Dent?

1148
01:25:26,273 --> 01:25:29,071
You have all these rules,
and you think they'll save you.

1149
01:25:32,033 --> 01:25:34,342
-He's in control.
-I have one rule.

1150
01:25:34,513 --> 01:25:37,471
Oh. Then that's the rule you'll have
to break to know the truth.

1151
01:25:37,633 --> 01:25:38,748
Which is?

1152
01:25:38,913 --> 01:25:41,222
The only sensible way to live
in this world is without rules.

1153
01:25:41,393 --> 01:25:43,953
And tonight you're gonna break
your one rule.

1154
01:25:44,113 --> 01:25:45,102
I'm considering it.

1155
01:25:45,273 --> 01:25:47,787
No, there's only minutes left, you're
gonna have to play my little game...

1156
01:25:47,953 --> 01:25:50,421
...if you wanna save one of them.

1157
01:25:50,913 --> 01:25:51,902
"Them"?

1158
01:25:52,073 --> 01:25:55,952
You know, for a while there,
I thought you really were Dent.

1159
01:25:56,113 --> 01:25:58,627
The way you threw yourself after her.

1160
01:26:04,673 --> 01:26:05,708
Look at you go.

1161
01:26:11,113 --> 01:26:14,549
Does Harvey know
about you and his little bunny?

1162
01:26:15,433 --> 01:26:16,752
Where are they?!

1163
01:26:16,913 --> 01:26:18,824
Killing is making a choice.

1164
01:26:18,993 --> 01:26:21,951
-Where are they?!
-Choose between one life or the other.

1165
01:26:22,673 --> 01:26:26,746
Your friend the district attorney,
or his blushing bride-to-be.

1166
01:26:31,713 --> 01:26:35,626
You have nothing,
nothing to threaten me with.

1167
01:26:36,033 --> 01:26:39,389
Nothing to do with all your strength.

1168
01:26:39,593 --> 01:26:42,869
Don't worry, I'm gonna tell you
where they are, both of them.

1169
01:26:43,033 --> 01:26:45,945
And that's the point.
You'll have to choose.

1170
01:26:46,673 --> 01:26:49,392
He's at 250 52nd Street...

1171
01:26:49,553 --> 01:26:52,750
...and she's on Avenue X at Cicero.

1172
01:26:54,753 --> 01:26:56,425
-Which one you going after?
-Rachel.

1173
01:26:57,793 --> 01:26:59,146
We're getting Dent!

1174
01:27:01,313 --> 01:27:04,032
250 52nd Street!

1175
01:27:06,833 --> 01:27:08,585
Hello?

1176
01:27:09,513 --> 01:27:11,788
Can anybody hear me?

1177
01:27:14,113 --> 01:27:16,627
Hello!

1178
01:27:20,473 --> 01:27:22,623
-Rachel?
-Harvey.

1179
01:27:22,793 --> 01:27:24,909
Oh, Harvey, thank God. Are you okay?

1180
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:26,586
I'm all right. I'm in a--

1181
01:27:26,753 --> 01:27:30,189
I'm in a warehouse.
They got me wired to these oil drums.

1182
01:27:31,193 --> 01:27:32,342
I am too.

1183
01:27:32,873 --> 01:27:34,511
Harvey.

1184
01:27:41,473 --> 01:27:43,828
I want my phone call.

1185
01:27:43,993 --> 01:27:46,666
I want it. I want it.
I want my phone call.

1186
01:27:47,313 --> 01:27:49,065
That's nice.

1187
01:27:50,513 --> 01:27:55,143
How many of your friends have I killed?

1188
01:27:58,753 --> 01:27:59,788
I'm a 20-year man...

1189
01:27:59,953 --> 01:28:03,263
...and I know the difference between
punks who need a little lesson in manners...

1190
01:28:03,433 --> 01:28:06,186
...and the freaks like you
who would just enjoy it.

1191
01:28:07,033 --> 01:28:09,388
And you killed six of my friends.

1192
01:28:09,553 --> 01:28:10,542
Six?

1193
01:28:10,713 --> 01:28:13,068
Please. My insides hurt.

1194
01:28:13,233 --> 01:28:14,905
I don't really care. Back away.

1195
01:28:15,073 --> 01:28:18,110
The boss said he'd make the voices
go away.

1196
01:28:18,273 --> 01:28:21,663
He said he'd go inside
and replace them with bright lights...

1197
01:28:21,833 --> 01:28:22,902
...like Christmas.

1198
01:28:23,073 --> 01:28:25,507
You're out of your mind, pal. Back off.

1199
01:28:25,673 --> 01:28:28,392
Get a medic to the holding tank.
Come on. Get the door open.

1200
01:28:28,593 --> 01:28:29,708
You guys, back off!

1201
01:28:29,873 --> 01:28:31,943
Listen, we don't have a lot of time.

1202
01:28:32,113 --> 01:28:35,947
They told me that only one of us
was gonna make it...

1203
01:28:36,113 --> 01:28:39,310
...and that they were gonna
let our friends choose.

1204
01:28:41,913 --> 01:28:43,949
Okay, Rachel.

1205
01:28:44,513 --> 01:28:47,505
It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be all right.
They're coming for you.

1206
01:28:47,673 --> 01:28:51,791
Listen to me. I'll help you. Just talk me
through what's going on with you.

1207
01:28:51,953 --> 01:28:53,784
Can you find something,
anything, sharp?

1208
01:28:53,953 --> 01:28:55,306
I'm trying.

1209
01:28:55,473 --> 01:28:57,543
-What's--?
-Shit.

1210
01:28:57,713 --> 01:28:59,146
Harvey?

1211
01:29:02,753 --> 01:29:04,345
Harvey, what's happening?

1212
01:29:13,313 --> 01:29:16,988
All available units,
converge at 250 52nd Street.

1213
01:29:17,313 --> 01:29:21,226
Do you wanna know why I use a knife?

1214
01:29:23,433 --> 01:29:24,707
Guns are too quick.

1215
01:29:24,873 --> 01:29:28,104
You can't savor all the...

1216
01:29:28,273 --> 01:29:31,470
...little emotions.

1217
01:29:33,313 --> 01:29:37,989
You see, in their last moments...

1218
01:29:38,153 --> 01:29:40,348
...people show you who they really are.

1219
01:29:41,393 --> 01:29:46,831
So in a way, I knew your friends
better than you ever did.

1220
01:29:50,433 --> 01:29:53,709
Would you like to know
which of them were cowards?

1221
01:29:59,953 --> 01:30:01,545
What's that?
Jeez.

1222
01:30:01,753 --> 01:30:03,709
He's got some kind of a...

1223
01:30:03,873 --> 01:30:06,945
-...contusion.
-I know you're gonna enjoy this.

1224
01:30:08,273 --> 01:30:11,868
I'm gonna have to try and enjoy it
even more.

1225
01:30:16,873 --> 01:30:18,101
Whoa, whoa!

1226
01:30:19,113 --> 01:30:20,102
Just put it down.

1227
01:30:20,273 --> 01:30:22,946
Take it easy. Take it easy.
Drop the weapon now!

1228
01:30:23,113 --> 01:30:26,901
-It's my own damn fault, just shoot him!
-Let him go now! Drop it!

1229
01:30:27,193 --> 01:30:30,071
-What? Sorry?
-What do you want?

1230
01:30:31,073 --> 01:30:32,904
I just want my phone call.

1231
01:30:35,793 --> 01:30:38,353
What--? What--? What's happening?

1232
01:30:38,513 --> 01:30:41,232
Just talk to me, just for one second.

1233
01:30:43,473 --> 01:30:46,033
-All right?
-Right.

1234
01:30:47,873 --> 01:30:49,226
Ow.

1235
01:30:50,113 --> 01:30:51,626
-Ow.
-Shh, shh, shh.

1236
01:30:57,353 --> 01:30:59,309
Is that a phone?

1237
01:31:08,593 --> 01:31:09,867
Mount the curb!

1238
01:31:17,553 --> 01:31:21,387
Harvey, just in case,
I wanna tell you something, okay?

1239
01:31:21,553 --> 01:31:23,271
Don't think like that, Rachel.
They're coming for you.

1240
01:31:23,433 --> 01:31:25,628
I know they are,
but I don't want them to.

1241
01:31:29,873 --> 01:31:33,786
I don't wanna live without you,
and I do have an answer for you.

1242
01:31:34,193 --> 01:31:35,865
My answer is yes.

1243
01:31:38,513 --> 01:31:41,152
No! No! No!

1244
01:31:41,313 --> 01:31:43,827
Not me! Why you coming for me?

1245
01:31:43,993 --> 01:31:44,982
No!

1246
01:31:46,593 --> 01:31:48,106
Rachel! Rachel!

1247
01:31:48,313 --> 01:31:50,543
-Harvey.
-No! No! Rachel!

1248
01:31:50,713 --> 01:31:51,702
Okay.

1249
01:31:51,873 --> 01:31:52,908
Rachel!

1250
01:31:53,313 --> 01:31:54,792
No! No!

1251
01:31:54,953 --> 01:31:58,912
Harvey, it's okay.
It's all right. Listen.

1252
01:31:59,073 --> 01:32:00,347
Some--

1253
01:32:05,993 --> 01:32:07,142
No, Commissioner!

1254
01:32:07,313 --> 01:32:09,873
Rachel! No!

1255
01:32:23,633 --> 01:32:24,702
Hello there.

1256
01:32:30,353 --> 01:32:33,709
Back at the MCU, the Joker's gone.

1257
01:32:34,593 --> 01:32:36,231
With Lau?

1258
01:32:38,913 --> 01:32:41,381
The Joker planned to be caught.

1259
01:32:41,713 --> 01:32:43,783
He wanted me to lock him up
in the MCU.

1260
01:33:02,633 --> 01:33:04,589
Dear Bruce:

1261
01:33:06,273 --> 01:33:08,707
I need to be honest and clear.

1262
01:33:10,673 --> 01:33:13,107
I'm going to marry Harvey Dent.

1263
01:33:13,273 --> 01:33:17,027
I love him, and I wanna spend
the rest of my life with him.

1264
01:33:17,553 --> 01:33:21,785
When I told you that if Gotham no longer
needed Batman, we could be together...

1265
01:33:21,953 --> 01:33:24,069
...I meant it.

1266
01:33:24,313 --> 01:33:28,864
But now I'm sure the day won't come
when you no longer need Batman.

1267
01:33:29,873 --> 01:33:31,704
I hope it does.

1268
01:33:31,873 --> 01:33:34,512
And if it does, I will be there...

1269
01:33:35,033 --> 01:33:36,386
...but as your friend.

1270
01:33:37,073 --> 01:33:39,223
I'm sorry, Harvey.

1271
01:33:39,393 --> 01:33:41,668
I'm sorry to let you down.

1272
01:33:41,833 --> 01:33:46,623
If you lose your faith in me,
please keep your faith in people.

1273
01:33:47,193 --> 01:33:51,425
Love, now and always, Rachel.

1274
01:33:59,073 --> 01:34:01,303
Prepared a little breakfast.

1275
01:34:05,273 --> 01:34:07,104
-Very well, then.
-Alfred.

1276
01:34:07,273 --> 01:34:08,388
Yes, Master Wayne?

1277
01:34:09,713 --> 01:34:11,863
Did I bring this on her?

1278
01:34:12,873 --> 01:34:14,989
I was meant to inspire good...

1279
01:34:15,153 --> 01:34:17,428
...not madness, not death.

1280
01:34:17,593 --> 01:34:22,030
You have inspired good. But you spat
in the faces of Gotham's criminals.

1281
01:34:22,193 --> 01:34:24,184
Didn't you think
there might be some casualties?

1282
01:34:24,353 --> 01:34:26,662
Things are always going to get worse
before they got better.

1283
01:34:26,993 --> 01:34:28,392
But Rachel, Alfred.

1284
01:34:28,553 --> 01:34:32,182
Rachel believed in what you stood for...

1285
01:34:32,353 --> 01:34:34,184
...what we stand for.

1286
01:34:34,353 --> 01:34:35,752
Gotham needs you.

1287
01:34:36,273 --> 01:34:39,106
No, Gotham needs its true hero...

1288
01:34:39,593 --> 01:34:43,552
...and I let that murdering psychopath
blow him half to hell.

1289
01:34:43,713 --> 01:34:45,943
Which is why, for now...

1290
01:34:46,713 --> 01:34:48,544
...they're gonna have to
make do with you.

1291
01:34:50,673 --> 01:34:52,425
She was going to wait for me, Alfred.

1292
01:34:54,353 --> 01:34:56,309
Dent doesn't know.

1293
01:34:56,473 --> 01:34:57,701
He can never know.

1294
01:35:00,033 --> 01:35:01,591
What's that?

1295
01:35:01,753 --> 01:35:04,586
-It can wait.
-That bandit...

1296
01:35:05,033 --> 01:35:07,069
...in the forest in Burma.

1297
01:35:07,233 --> 01:35:09,189
-Did you catch him?
-Yes.

1298
01:35:09,353 --> 01:35:10,627
How?

1299
01:35:11,993 --> 01:35:13,551
We burned the forest down.

1300
01:35:51,193 --> 01:35:53,707
He's credible source, an M&A lawyer
from a prestigious consultancy, and

1301
01:35:53,873 --> 01:35:57,104
He says he's waited as long as he can
for the Batman to do the right thing.

1302
01:35:57,273 --> 01:35:59,264
And now he's taking matters
into his own hands.

1303
01:35:59,433 --> 01:36:02,266
We'll be live at 5 with
the true identity of the Batman.

1304
01:36:18,033 --> 01:36:19,591
I'm sorry about Rachel.

1305
01:36:22,193 --> 01:36:26,823
The doctor says you're in agonizing pain,
but that you won't accept medication.

1306
01:36:27,833 --> 01:36:29,710
That you're refusing to...

1307
01:36:29,873 --> 01:36:31,545
...accept skin grafts.

1308
01:36:31,873 --> 01:36:34,023
Remember that name...

1309
01:36:34,593 --> 01:36:36,823
...you all had for me...

1310
01:36:37,273 --> 01:36:39,992
...when I was at Internal Affairs?

1311
01:36:42,353 --> 01:36:43,581
What was it, Gordon?

1312
01:36:44,233 --> 01:36:45,552
Harvey, I....

1313
01:36:45,713 --> 01:36:47,146
Say it.

1314
01:36:48,513 --> 01:36:50,344
Say it!

1315
01:36:57,713 --> 01:37:00,671
Two-Face. Harvey Two-Face.

1316
01:37:02,193 --> 01:37:06,311
Why should I hide who I am?

1317
01:37:07,473 --> 01:37:08,747
I know you tried to warn me.

1318
01:37:09,593 --> 01:37:10,742
I'm sorry.

1319
01:37:11,353 --> 01:37:13,867
Wuertz picked you up.
Was he working for them?

1320
01:37:16,073 --> 01:37:18,348
Do you know who picked up Rachel?

1321
01:37:19,153 --> 01:37:22,031
Harvey, I need to know
which of my men I can trust.

1322
01:37:22,393 --> 01:37:24,429
Why would you listen to me now?

1323
01:37:25,513 --> 01:37:27,105
I'm sorry, Harvey.

1324
01:37:29,553 --> 01:37:31,271
No.

1325
01:37:31,713 --> 01:37:33,749
No, you're not.

1326
01:37:34,753 --> 01:37:35,947
Not yet.

1327
01:37:40,993 --> 01:37:43,587
This craziness, it's too much.

1328
01:37:43,793 --> 01:37:46,910
You should've thought about that
before you let the clown out of the box.

1329
01:37:47,073 --> 01:37:48,745
You want him?

1330
01:37:51,113 --> 01:37:53,343
I can tell you
where he'll be this afternoon.

1331
01:38:01,073 --> 01:38:03,268
Not so crazy as you look.

1332
01:38:03,433 --> 01:38:07,028
I told you, I'm a man of my word.

1333
01:38:10,113 --> 01:38:11,307
Where is the Italian?

1334
01:38:11,473 --> 01:38:14,465
All tactical units will converge
on the location in 20 minutes.

1335
01:38:14,633 --> 01:38:17,943
I want auxiliary units to cover
all possible getaway routes.

1336
01:38:18,513 --> 01:38:19,628
Please.

1337
01:38:19,793 --> 01:38:22,990
Joker-man, what you do
with all your money?

1338
01:38:23,633 --> 01:38:26,193
You see, I'm a guy of simple taste.

1339
01:38:26,353 --> 01:38:27,945
I enjoy...

1340
01:38:28,113 --> 01:38:29,432
...dynamite...

1341
01:38:29,593 --> 01:38:31,072
...and gunpowder...

1342
01:38:31,513 --> 01:38:33,822
...and gasoline.

1343
01:38:35,233 --> 01:38:37,383
-What the--?
-Ah, ah, ah.

1344
01:38:39,153 --> 01:38:41,872
And you know the thing
that they have in common?

1345
01:38:42,353 --> 01:38:43,581
They're cheap.

1346
01:38:43,753 --> 01:38:46,313
I wanna know how much they are paying
you to say who Batman really is?

1347
01:38:46,473 --> 01:38:50,261
This is our chance. I want Lau alive.
The Joker, either way.

1348
01:38:50,433 --> 01:38:51,786
Hey, Jim. Get a load of this.

1349
01:38:51,953 --> 01:38:53,227
Let's take the next caller.

1350
01:38:53,393 --> 01:38:55,463
Harvey Dent didn't wanna
give in to this maniac.

1351
01:38:55,633 --> 01:38:56,861
You think you know better than him?

1352
01:38:57,033 --> 01:39:00,264
I think that if we could talk to Dent
today, he may feel differently.

1353
01:39:00,433 --> 01:39:04,346
And we wish him a speedy recovery.
Because God knows, we need him now.

1354
01:39:04,513 --> 01:39:06,629
You said you were a man of your word.

1355
01:39:06,913 --> 01:39:08,869
Oh, I am.

1356
01:39:10,513 --> 01:39:13,073
I'm only burning my half.

1357
01:39:14,353 --> 01:39:16,389
All you care about is money.

1358
01:39:16,553 --> 01:39:19,863
This town deserves
a better class of criminal...

1359
01:39:20,033 --> 01:39:22,183
...and I'm gonna give it to them.

1360
01:39:22,953 --> 01:39:25,342
Tell your men they work for me now.

1361
01:39:25,513 --> 01:39:27,788
This is my city.

1362
01:39:28,433 --> 01:39:30,867
They won't work for a freak.

1363
01:39:31,033 --> 01:39:32,671
"Freak."

1364
01:39:32,833 --> 01:39:35,188
Why don't we
cut you up into little pieces...

1365
01:39:35,353 --> 01:39:36,752
...and feed you to your pooches? Hm?

1366
01:39:36,913 --> 01:39:39,666
And then we'll see how loyal
a hungry dog really is.

1367
01:39:41,593 --> 01:39:43,823
It's not about money...

1368
01:39:43,993 --> 01:39:47,065
...it's about sending a message.

1369
01:39:47,833 --> 01:39:50,188
Everything burns.

1370
01:39:52,593 --> 01:39:54,663
-Who is this?
I had a vision...

1371
01:39:54,833 --> 01:39:57,472
...of a world without Batman.

1372
01:39:57,633 --> 01:39:59,783
The Mob ground out a little profit...

1373
01:39:59,953 --> 01:40:03,707
...and the police tried to shut them down
one block at a time.

1374
01:40:03,873 --> 01:40:07,024
And it was so boring.

1375
01:40:07,193 --> 01:40:09,070
I've had a change of heart.

1376
01:40:09,233 --> 01:40:11,747
I don't want Mr. Reese
spoiling everything...

1377
01:40:11,913 --> 01:40:16,429
...but why should I have all the fun?
Let's give someone else a chance.

1378
01:40:16,593 --> 01:40:21,223
If Coleman Reese
isn't dead in 60 minutes...

1379
01:40:21,393 --> 01:40:23,384
...then I blow up a hospital.

1380
01:40:23,553 --> 01:40:25,066
I want you to call in every officer.

1381
01:40:25,233 --> 01:40:28,430
Tell them to head to their nearest
hospital and start evac and search.

1382
01:40:28,593 --> 01:40:30,629
Call the transit authority,
school board, prisons.

1383
01:40:30,793 --> 01:40:32,351
Get every available bus down to a hospital.

1384
01:40:32,513 --> 01:40:36,904
The priority is Gotham General. Wheel
everybody out of that place right now.

1385
01:40:37,073 --> 01:40:38,665
You, you and you, you come with me.

1386
01:40:38,833 --> 01:40:40,630
-Where are we going, sir?
-To get Reese.

1387
01:40:40,953 --> 01:40:43,911
I need you plugged in, checking
Gordon's men and their families.

1388
01:40:44,073 --> 01:40:46,189
-Looking for?
-Hospital admissions.

1389
01:40:46,353 --> 01:40:47,945
Will you be wanting the Batpod, Sir?

1390
01:40:48,113 --> 01:40:49,990
In the middle of the day, Alfred?
Not very subtle.

1391
01:40:50,153 --> 01:40:51,381
The Lamborghini, then.

1392
01:40:52,273 --> 01:40:53,342
Much more subtle.

1393
01:41:06,633 --> 01:41:09,022
Excuse me. Let me through.
Excuse me. Okay.

1394
01:41:09,193 --> 01:41:12,549
Sir, could you help, please?

1395
01:41:12,713 --> 01:41:14,351
I'm gonna find a bus for him.

1396
01:41:16,233 --> 01:41:18,030
Sir? Commissioner, do you really think...

1397
01:41:18,193 --> 01:41:20,263
...an ordinary citizen
would try to kill this man?

1398
01:41:24,593 --> 01:41:26,823
Sir. Commissioner.

1399
01:41:28,833 --> 01:41:30,949
Get the cars around the back!

1400
01:41:33,233 --> 01:41:34,507
Go. Keep rolling, Sam.

1401
01:41:40,233 --> 01:41:42,110
I see O'Brien and Richards.

1402
01:41:42,673 --> 01:41:46,029
No immediate family member
admitted to a Gotham hospital.

1403
01:41:47,273 --> 01:41:50,663
They're trying to kill me.
-Well, maybe Batman can save you.

1404
01:42:03,273 --> 01:42:05,787
Davis, they got space. Bring him out.

1405
01:42:07,393 --> 01:42:09,111
Davis.

1406
01:42:14,033 --> 01:42:16,263
I saw Burns and Zachary.

1407
01:42:16,433 --> 01:42:17,582
Nothing on them.

1408
01:42:17,753 --> 01:42:19,152
And a patrolman I don't know.

1409
01:42:20,313 --> 01:42:22,144
Okay, so, what now?

1410
01:42:22,993 --> 01:42:25,143
What do we do now?
Where are we going?

1411
01:42:27,793 --> 01:42:29,385
Send the information to Gordon.

1412
01:42:36,953 --> 01:42:38,432
Get out of here.

1413
01:42:40,393 --> 01:42:42,111
Davis.

1414
01:42:45,153 --> 01:42:47,462
Ma'am, we're gonna have to
move him now.

1415
01:42:58,673 --> 01:43:00,903
It's Berg, isn't it?
-Commissioner.

1416
01:43:01,993 --> 01:43:03,392
You okay, son?

1417
01:43:20,673 --> 01:43:22,186
Hi.

1418
01:43:26,833 --> 01:43:28,266
You know...

1419
01:43:29,073 --> 01:43:32,031
...I don't want there to be
any hard feelings between us, Harvey.

1420
01:43:32,193 --> 01:43:35,185
-When you and--
-Rachel!

1421
01:43:35,353 --> 01:43:37,548
--Rachel were being abducted...

1422
01:43:37,713 --> 01:43:40,591
...I was sitting in Gordon's cage.

1423
01:43:40,913 --> 01:43:42,744
I didn't rig those charges.

1424
01:43:42,953 --> 01:43:45,308
Your men, your plan.

1425
01:43:45,513 --> 01:43:47,868
Do I really look like a guy with a plan?

1426
01:43:48,273 --> 01:43:50,946
You know what I am?
I'm a dog chasing cars.

1427
01:43:51,553 --> 01:43:53,908
I wouldn't know what to do with one
if I caught it.

1428
01:43:54,073 --> 01:43:57,065
You know? I just do things.

1429
01:43:57,433 --> 01:44:00,982
The Mob has plans. The cops have plans.

1430
01:44:01,153 --> 01:44:03,269
Gordon's got plans.

1431
01:44:03,433 --> 01:44:06,266
You know, they're schemers.

1432
01:44:06,433 --> 01:44:10,028
Schemers trying to control
their little worlds.

1433
01:44:10,193 --> 01:44:11,626
I'm not a schemer.

1434
01:44:11,793 --> 01:44:13,351
I try to show the schemers...

1435
01:44:13,513 --> 01:44:18,587
...how pathetic their attempts
to control things really are.

1436
01:44:19,513 --> 01:44:22,425
So when I say-- Ah. Come here.

1437
01:44:22,913 --> 01:44:26,303
When I say that you and your girlfriend
was nothing personal...

1438
01:44:27,793 --> 01:44:29,909
...you know that I'm telling the truth.

1439
01:44:32,313 --> 01:44:34,986
-I'm gonna need your weapon.
-What?

1440
01:44:38,593 --> 01:44:40,345
Why? Because my wife's in the hospital?

1441
01:44:41,033 --> 01:44:42,512
Yeah, that would be why.

1442
01:44:43,393 --> 01:44:46,465
It's the schemers
that put you where you are.

1443
01:44:46,633 --> 01:44:50,262
You were a schemer, you had plans...

1444
01:44:50,433 --> 01:44:52,503
...and look where that got you.

1445
01:45:02,833 --> 01:45:05,108
The Police, of course,
are taking every possible precaution...

1446
01:45:05,273 --> 01:45:07,309
...and urging everyone not to
take matters into their hands.

1447
01:45:07,473 --> 01:45:09,907
I just did what I do best.

1448
01:45:10,073 --> 01:45:13,543
I took your little plan,
I turned it on itself.

1449
01:45:13,713 --> 01:45:18,833
Look what I did to this city with a few
drums of gas and a couple of bullets.

1450
01:45:18,993 --> 01:45:22,144
Hm? You know...
You know what I noticed?

1451
01:45:22,313 --> 01:45:25,703
Nobody panics when
things go "according to plan."

1452
01:45:25,873 --> 01:45:27,465
Even if the plan is horrifying.

1453
01:45:28,073 --> 01:45:32,908
If tomorrow I tell the press that, like,
a gangbanger will get shot...

1454
01:45:33,073 --> 01:45:36,383
...or a truckload of soldiers
will be blowing up...

1455
01:45:36,673 --> 01:45:37,708
...nobody panics.

1456
01:45:38,393 --> 01:45:41,351
Because it's all part of the plan.

1457
01:45:41,513 --> 01:45:46,223
But when I say that
one little old mayor will die...

1458
01:45:46,473 --> 01:45:48,782
...well, then, everyone loses their minds.

1459
01:45:52,073 --> 01:45:54,871
Introduce a little anarchy...

1460
01:45:55,993 --> 01:45:58,143
...upset the established order...

1461
01:45:58,313 --> 01:46:02,670
...and everything becomes chaos.

1462
01:46:04,433 --> 01:46:07,072
I'm an agent of chaos.

1463
01:46:07,433 --> 01:46:09,663
Oh, and you know the thing
about chaos?

1464
01:46:11,633 --> 01:46:13,191
It's fair.

1465
01:46:22,033 --> 01:46:25,070
-You live.
-Mm-hm.

1466
01:46:25,553 --> 01:46:27,111
You die.

1467
01:46:27,313 --> 01:46:29,224
Mmm. Now we're talking.

1468
01:46:38,193 --> 01:46:39,626
Mr. Reese.

1469
01:46:57,073 --> 01:46:59,143
That's Mr. Wayne, isn't it?

1470
01:46:59,313 --> 01:47:02,191
-That was a very brave thing you did.
-Trying to catch the light?

1471
01:47:02,513 --> 01:47:05,232
-You weren't protecting the van?
-Why? Who's in it?

1472
01:47:10,473 --> 01:47:12,464
Don't you think
I should go to the hospital?

1473
01:47:12,633 --> 01:47:15,022
You don't watch a whole lot of news,
do you, Mr. Wayne?

1474
01:48:18,473 --> 01:48:20,225
Southeast.

1475
01:48:20,393 --> 01:48:22,509
It's Gotham General.

1476
01:48:23,233 --> 01:48:24,825
-Did you clear the building?
Yeah.

1477
01:48:27,713 --> 01:48:29,351
We must know
how many were inside.

1478
01:48:29,513 --> 01:48:30,832
You have patient lists, roll call.

1479
01:48:30,993 --> 01:48:33,223
Right now we're showing
50 people missing. One bus.

1480
01:48:33,393 --> 01:48:36,430
All these others buses were heading off to
other hospitals. My guess is we missed one.

1481
01:48:36,593 --> 01:48:38,629
Yeah? Well, what's your guess
about where Harvey Dent is?

1482
01:48:38,793 --> 01:48:43,071
Keep looking. And keep it to yourself.
Anybody asks, we got him out.

1483
01:48:45,553 --> 01:48:47,862
Get me the mayor's office on the line.

1484
01:48:48,993 --> 01:48:50,665
We're gonna need the National Guard.

1485
01:48:50,833 --> 01:48:52,391
--people are still missing...

1486
01:48:52,553 --> 01:48:53,702
...including GCN's own Mike Engel.

1487
01:48:53,873 --> 01:48:56,990
I'm now being told that we're cutting to
a video GCN has just received.

1488
01:48:57,153 --> 01:48:58,984
I'm Mike Engel for Gotham Tonight.

1489
01:48:59,473 --> 01:49:02,670
What does it take to make you
people wanna join in?

1490
01:49:02,833 --> 01:49:05,301
You failed to kill the lawyer.
I've gotta get you off the bench...

1491
01:49:05,473 --> 01:49:07,145
-...and into the game.
Bench. Game.

1492
01:49:09,233 --> 01:49:11,269
Come nightfall, this city is mine.
Mine.

1493
01:49:11,433 --> 01:49:14,072
-And anyone left here plays by my rules.
-Rules.

1494
01:49:14,353 --> 01:49:17,550
Mr. Fox? Security is showing
a break-in at the R&D Department.

1495
01:49:17,713 --> 01:49:19,749
If you don't wanna be in the game...

1496
01:49:19,913 --> 01:49:21,232
-...get out now.
-Get out now.

1497
01:49:23,313 --> 01:49:26,146
But the bridge-and-tunnel crowd
are sure in for a surprise.

1498
01:49:26,513 --> 01:49:28,151
Ha-ha, ha-ha.

1499
01:50:00,433 --> 01:50:02,261
Gotham P.D. has shut down...
-Sweet Jesus.

1500
01:50:02,299 --> 01:50:04,188
-...the bridges and tunnels across the area.

1501
01:50:04,453 --> 01:50:07,629
Shouldn't you be out there,
you know, doing something?

1502
01:50:07,793 --> 01:50:09,670
It's my day off.

1503
01:50:10,273 --> 01:50:11,786
I gotta take a leak.

1504
01:50:11,953 --> 01:50:14,183
Keep an eye out for me, will you?

1505
01:50:19,553 --> 01:50:21,430
Now what?
You need someone to shake it for you?

1506
01:50:21,593 --> 01:50:23,106
Hello.

1507
01:50:23,793 --> 01:50:25,226
Dent.

1508
01:50:25,393 --> 01:50:27,509
Jesus. I thought you was dead.

1509
01:50:27,673 --> 01:50:29,265
Half.

1510
01:50:35,073 --> 01:50:36,586
Who picked up Rachel, Wuertz?

1511
01:50:36,753 --> 01:50:38,664
-It must've been Maroni's men.
-Shut up!

1512
01:50:40,353 --> 01:50:42,389
Are you telling me
that you're gonna protect...

1513
01:50:42,553 --> 01:50:44,225
...the other traitor in Gordon's unit?

1514
01:50:44,393 --> 01:50:45,792
I don't know, he never told me.

1515
01:50:45,953 --> 01:50:49,423
Listen, Dent, I swear to God, I didn't
know what they were gonna do to you.

1516
01:50:50,913 --> 01:50:52,028
That's funny...

1517
01:50:53,713 --> 01:50:56,352
...because I don't know
what's gonna happen to you either.

1518
01:51:00,313 --> 01:51:02,144
Beautiful, isn't it?

1519
01:51:02,513 --> 01:51:04,105
Beautiful.

1520
01:51:04,633 --> 01:51:05,702
Unethical.

1521
01:51:06,833 --> 01:51:08,312
Dangerous.

1522
01:51:08,513 --> 01:51:11,869
You've turned every cell phone
in Gotham into a microphone.

1523
01:51:12,033 --> 01:51:14,342
And a high-frequency generator-receiver.

1524
01:51:14,513 --> 01:51:19,382
You took my sonar concept
and applied it to every phone in the city.

1525
01:51:19,553 --> 01:51:23,944
With half the city feeding you sonar,
you can image all of Gotham.

1526
01:51:25,793 --> 01:51:27,112
This is wrong.

1527
01:51:27,273 --> 01:51:29,229
I've gotta find this man, Lucius.

1528
01:51:31,153 --> 01:51:32,381
At what cost?

1529
01:51:32,553 --> 01:51:35,226
The database is null-key encrypted.

1530
01:51:35,393 --> 01:51:37,509
It can only be accessed by one person.

1531
01:51:38,793 --> 01:51:40,863
This is too much power for one person.

1532
01:51:41,033 --> 01:51:43,103
That's why I gave it to you.

1533
01:51:43,553 --> 01:51:44,702
Only you can use it.

1534
01:51:44,873 --> 01:51:48,502
Spying on 30 million people
isn't part of my job description.

1535
01:51:50,633 --> 01:51:54,182
This is an audio sample. If he talks
within range of any phone in the city...

1536
01:51:54,353 --> 01:51:56,469
...you can triangulate his position.

1537
01:51:56,913 --> 01:51:59,302
I'll help you this one time.

1538
01:51:59,753 --> 01:52:01,471
But consider this my resignation.

1539
01:52:01,633 --> 01:52:06,024
As long as this machine is
at Wayne Enterprises, I won't be.

1540
01:52:06,753 --> 01:52:08,584
When you're finished...

1541
01:52:09,233 --> 01:52:10,302
...type in your name.

1542
01:52:18,553 --> 01:52:21,511
Well, my officers are going over
every inch of the tunnels and bridges...

1543
01:52:21,673 --> 01:52:24,745
...but with the Joker's threat,
they're not an option.

1544
01:52:24,913 --> 01:52:27,632
-And land routes east?
-Backed up for hours.

1545
01:52:27,793 --> 01:52:31,263
Which leaves the ferries
with 30,000 ready to board.

1546
01:52:31,433 --> 01:52:34,345
Plus, I wanna use the ferries so I can
get some of those prisoners off the island.

1547
01:52:34,673 --> 01:52:37,346
The men you and dent put away?
Those aren't people I'm worried about.

1548
01:52:37,513 --> 01:52:39,549
You should be.
Whatever the Joker's planning...

1549
01:52:39,713 --> 01:52:42,025
...it's a good bet Harvey's prisoners might be involved.

1550
01:52:42,113 --> 01:52:44,025
I wanna get them out of here.

1551
01:52:45,433 --> 01:52:46,582
So where is Harvey?

1552
01:52:47,153 --> 01:52:50,190
-We haven't found him.
-Oh, Jesus.

1553
01:52:53,873 --> 01:52:55,864
How long can you keep this quiet?

1554
01:53:09,393 --> 01:53:11,953
Don't stop for lights, cops, nothing.

1555
01:53:12,753 --> 01:53:14,823
Going to join your wife?

1556
01:53:18,193 --> 01:53:20,582
-You love her?
-Yes.

1557
01:53:21,433 --> 01:53:24,266
You ever imagine what it would be like
to listen to her die?

1558
01:53:24,433 --> 01:53:25,866
Look, take it up with the Joker.

1559
01:53:26,033 --> 01:53:29,150
He killed your woman. He made you...

1560
01:53:29,313 --> 01:53:30,302
...like this.

1561
01:53:30,673 --> 01:53:33,551
The Joker's just a mad dog.

1562
01:53:33,713 --> 01:53:36,227
I want whoever let him off the leash.

1563
01:53:36,913 --> 01:53:40,110
I took care of Wuertz, but who is
your other man inside Gordon's unit?

1564
01:53:40,273 --> 01:53:42,787
Who picked up Rachel?
Must have been someone she trusted.

1565
01:53:43,953 --> 01:53:45,989
Look, if I tell you...

1566
01:53:46,153 --> 01:53:47,142
...will you let me go?

1567
01:53:47,873 --> 01:53:49,147
Can't hurt your chances.

1568
01:53:51,793 --> 01:53:53,385
It was Ramirez.

1569
01:53:58,593 --> 01:54:01,710
-But you said--
-I said it couldn't hurt your chances.

1570
01:54:05,153 --> 01:54:07,189
You're a lucky man.

1571
01:54:10,513 --> 01:54:12,185
-But he's not.
-Who?

1572
01:54:14,993 --> 01:54:16,346
Your driver.

1573
01:54:29,033 --> 01:54:30,022
Stand back.

1574
01:54:30,193 --> 01:54:32,423
Hey Man, that ain't right.
We should be on that boat.

1575
01:54:32,593 --> 01:54:35,061
You wanna ride across
with them? Be my guest.

1576
01:54:57,353 --> 01:54:58,991
Sir, they've stopped their engines.

1577
01:54:59,153 --> 01:55:00,142
Right, get on the radio.

1578
01:55:00,313 --> 01:55:03,783
Tell them we'll come back and pick
them up once we dump the scumbags.

1579
01:55:03,953 --> 01:55:06,228
Liberty, this is Spirit. Come in.

1580
01:55:08,193 --> 01:55:09,342
What the heck was that?

1581
01:55:11,193 --> 01:55:12,592
What the--?

1582
01:55:13,113 --> 01:55:16,264
Liberty, come in, please.
This is Spirit. Come in.

1583
01:55:17,833 --> 01:55:19,630
Liberty, we have the same thing.
We've lost both engines.

1584
01:55:19,793 --> 01:55:21,226
-Liberty, come in.
Fox.

1585
01:55:21,393 --> 01:55:23,782
There's something going on
on the ferries.

1586
01:55:24,513 --> 01:55:26,708
Get down to the engine room now.

1587
01:55:27,313 --> 01:55:29,429
Hey, buddy, what's happening?

1588
01:55:37,673 --> 01:55:40,983
Captain, we got a hundred barrels
down there rigged to blow. And this.

1589
01:55:53,553 --> 01:55:54,588
Oh, my God.

1590
01:55:54,753 --> 01:55:56,505
Looks like some kind of detonator.

1591
01:55:56,673 --> 01:55:59,426
Why would they give us
the detonator to our own bomb?

1592
01:56:02,233 --> 01:56:03,552
Tonight, you're all gonna be...

1593
01:56:03,713 --> 01:56:05,385
...a part of a social experiment.

1594
01:56:09,073 --> 01:56:12,748
Through the magic of diesel fuel
and ammonium nitrate...

1595
01:56:12,913 --> 01:56:16,826
...I'm ready right now
to blow you all sky-high.

1596
01:56:16,993 --> 01:56:18,984
Liberty, come in, over.

1597
01:56:20,393 --> 01:56:21,382
It's dead.

1598
01:56:21,713 --> 01:56:26,025
If anyone attempts
to get off their boat, you all die.

1599
01:56:26,353 --> 01:56:27,581
I'm zeroing in.

1600
01:56:27,753 --> 01:56:32,110
Each of you has a remote
to blow up the other boat.

1601
01:56:32,273 --> 01:56:34,628
His voice is on the ferry...

1602
01:56:34,793 --> 01:56:36,749
...but it's not the source.

1603
01:56:38,913 --> 01:56:39,982
West.

1604
01:56:46,953 --> 01:56:49,148
-Gordon.
I have the Joker's location.

1605
01:56:49,313 --> 01:56:50,348
Prewitt Building.

1606
01:56:50,513 --> 01:56:52,868
Assemble on the building opposite.

1607
01:56:54,193 --> 01:56:56,866
At midnight, I blow you all up.

1608
01:56:57,033 --> 01:57:01,982
If, however, one of you presses
the button, I'll let that boat live.

1609
01:57:02,153 --> 01:57:04,189
So who's it gonna be?

1610
01:57:04,353 --> 01:57:06,787
Harvey Dent's most-wanted
scumbag collection...

1611
01:57:06,953 --> 01:57:10,150
...or the sweet and innocent civilians?

1612
01:57:10,313 --> 01:57:12,747
You choose.

1613
01:57:12,913 --> 01:57:14,744
Oh, and you might wanna
decide quickly...

1614
01:57:14,913 --> 01:57:19,065
...because the people on the other boat
may not be quite so noble.

1615
01:57:26,153 --> 01:57:27,142
Stay back.

1616
01:57:27,313 --> 01:57:30,942
Well, now, who are you to decide?
We ought to talk this over, at least.

1617
01:57:31,313 --> 01:57:34,749
We don't all have to die.
Those men had their chance.

1618
01:57:35,353 --> 01:57:38,982
-We are not going to talk about this.
-Why aren't we talking about it?

1619
01:57:39,153 --> 01:57:41,621
They're talking over the same exact
thing on the other boat.

1620
01:57:41,793 --> 01:57:43,988
-Let's put it to a vote.
Yes!

1621
01:57:49,073 --> 01:57:51,541
-Hello?
Barbara, it's Anna Ramirez.

1622
01:57:51,713 --> 01:57:54,625
Jim needs you to pack up
and put the kids in the car right away.

1623
01:57:54,793 --> 01:57:56,431
But the units outside....

1624
01:57:56,593 --> 01:57:58,106
Those cops can't be trusted.

1625
01:57:58,273 --> 01:58:01,106
Jim needs you away from them
as soon as possible.

1626
01:58:01,273 --> 01:58:04,106
I'll call them off for 10 minutes,
and you'll have to move fast.

1627
01:58:04,273 --> 01:58:07,948
-But where am I supposed to take them?
-250 52nd Street.

1628
01:58:08,113 --> 01:58:09,910
Leave as soon as
the patrol car pulls out.

1629
01:58:10,073 --> 01:58:11,392
Okay.

1630
01:58:11,753 --> 01:58:13,471
She believe you?

1631
01:58:13,673 --> 01:58:15,629
It's because she trusts you...

1632
01:58:15,953 --> 01:58:16,988
...just like Rachel did.

1633
01:58:17,153 --> 01:58:19,144
-I didn't know--
-Didn't know what they were gonna do?

1634
01:58:19,313 --> 01:58:21,952
You're the second cop to say that to me.

1635
01:58:22,193 --> 01:58:24,229
What exactly did you think
they were gonna do?

1636
01:58:24,393 --> 01:58:26,543
They got me early on.
My mother's hospital bills....

1637
01:58:26,713 --> 01:58:29,625
-Don't!
-I'm sorry.

1638
01:58:30,153 --> 01:58:32,508
You live to fight another day, officer.

1639
01:58:36,153 --> 01:58:37,905
We found the missing hospital bus.

1640
01:58:38,073 --> 01:58:39,711
And we have a hostage situation.

1641
01:58:41,713 --> 01:58:43,624
It's a shooting gallery.

1642
01:58:43,993 --> 01:58:46,188
Why would he choose a spot
with such big windows?

1643
01:58:46,353 --> 01:58:48,105
We have clear shots on five clowns.

1644
01:58:48,273 --> 01:58:50,912
Snipers take them out,
smash the windows, a team rappels in.

1645
01:58:51,313 --> 01:58:52,746
Team moves in by the stairwells.

1646
01:58:52,913 --> 01:58:54,949
Two, three casualties max.

1647
01:58:55,113 --> 01:58:56,910
-Let's do it.
It's not that simple.

1648
01:58:57,073 --> 01:58:58,403
-With the Joker, it never is.

1649
01:58:58,473 --> 01:59:00,010
-What's simple is that
every second we don't take in,

1650
01:59:00,019 --> 01:59:02,610
those people on the ferries get closer
to blowing each other up--

1651
01:59:02,673 --> 01:59:05,107
-That won't happen.
-Then he'll blow both of them up!

1652
01:59:05,273 --> 01:59:08,868
-We don't have time for paper ballots.
-I want everybody to put their votes...

1653
01:59:09,033 --> 01:59:10,944
...on this piece of paper.

1654
01:59:11,953 --> 01:59:14,990
If anyone's got pens, pass it along.

1655
01:59:14,993 --> 01:59:18,625
Thank you. Anybody else? Coming
through. Anybody else? Thank you.

1656
01:59:18,793 --> 01:59:21,546
We need to get these votes in quickly.

1657
01:59:21,713 --> 01:59:23,192
Come on.

1658
01:59:25,113 --> 01:59:27,149
What are you waiting for?
Just push the button!

1659
01:59:27,313 --> 01:59:29,190
We're running out of time!

1660
01:59:30,433 --> 01:59:32,185
I need five minutes alone.

1661
01:59:32,353 --> 01:59:34,105
No! There's no time!

1662
01:59:34,273 --> 01:59:35,626
We have clear shots!

1663
01:59:35,793 --> 01:59:38,591
Dent is in there with them.
We have to save Dent!

1664
01:59:38,753 --> 01:59:40,630
I have to save Dent.

1665
01:59:40,793 --> 01:59:41,862
Get ready.

1666
01:59:44,593 --> 01:59:47,153
Two minutes, then we breach.

1667
01:59:52,513 --> 01:59:53,946
Fox, I need picture.

1668
01:59:56,873 --> 01:59:59,228
-Hello?
Jim, we're in trouble.

1669
02:00:00,433 --> 02:00:02,628
Okay, you got POV on alpha...

1670
02:00:03,633 --> 02:00:05,510
...omni on beta.

1671
02:00:06,913 --> 02:00:10,144
Looks like clowns and hostages
on two floors.

1672
02:00:10,313 --> 02:00:12,622
There's a SWAT team on the stairwell.

1673
02:00:15,793 --> 02:00:18,307
Another SWAT team on the roof.

1674
02:00:19,793 --> 02:00:20,942
Line's clear.

1675
02:00:22,633 --> 02:00:25,227
-Barbara, calm down.
-He has the kids!

1676
02:00:25,393 --> 02:00:28,510
Hello, Jim.
-Harvey?

1677
02:00:29,273 --> 02:00:32,345
-Where's my family?
-Where my family died.

1678
02:00:35,313 --> 02:00:36,905
Blue team, acquire the target.

1679
02:00:38,513 --> 02:00:40,981
Entry team, set your charge.

1680
02:00:56,273 --> 02:00:58,025
Fox, the SWATs are
targeting the wrong people.

1681
02:00:58,193 --> 02:00:59,626
The clowns are the hostages.

1682
02:01:00,313 --> 02:01:02,031
Red team, go! Red team, go!

1683
02:01:05,633 --> 02:01:06,986
Entry team, blow and go!

1684
02:01:10,913 --> 02:01:12,266
Don't move.

1685
02:01:13,393 --> 02:01:14,712
Take the shot.

1686
02:01:20,113 --> 02:01:21,705
Those SWATs are coming in hot.

1687
02:01:21,873 --> 02:01:23,625
Clowns, put down your guns.

1688
02:01:24,113 --> 02:01:26,627
Drop your weapons!
On the ground, now!

1689
02:01:26,833 --> 02:01:29,870
Doctors, get down!
Clear the line of fire. Drop your weap--

1690
02:01:53,473 --> 02:01:54,588
Freeze!

1691
02:01:54,753 --> 02:01:57,028
Stand down or you will be--

1692
02:02:00,433 --> 02:02:01,832
Look up.

1693
02:02:02,393 --> 02:02:04,861
See those bad guys on the floor above?

1694
02:02:05,033 --> 02:02:07,911
They're waiting to ambush
the SWAT team coming up the elevator.

1695
02:02:08,353 --> 02:02:09,342
Sixty seconds.

1696
02:02:17,313 --> 02:02:21,704
The tally is 140 against, 396 for.

1697
02:02:29,513 --> 02:02:31,947
So go ahead. Do it.

1698
02:02:32,113 --> 02:02:34,024
We're still here.

1699
02:02:35,153 --> 02:02:37,986
And that means they haven't
killed us yet either.

1700
02:02:39,393 --> 02:02:41,065
Go, go, go!

1701
02:02:41,233 --> 02:02:42,951
Blue team, cover!

1702
02:02:45,793 --> 02:02:46,782
Uh-oh.

1703
02:02:48,233 --> 02:02:49,825
Trouble on the floor above.

1704
02:02:58,793 --> 02:03:00,112
Get down on the ground now!

1705
02:03:08,193 --> 02:03:10,502
Freeze! Stop or we will shoot.

1706
02:03:10,673 --> 02:03:12,584
We will shoot you. Drop the officer.

1707
02:03:12,753 --> 02:03:14,232
Release the officer right now.

1708
02:03:14,393 --> 02:03:16,270
Let him go now!
On your knees!

1709
02:03:16,833 --> 02:03:18,824
We got him. He's out of the game.

1710
02:03:18,993 --> 02:03:21,382
Keep your hands in the air!
Step away from the edge!

1711
02:03:29,113 --> 02:03:30,671
Halt!

1712
02:03:43,433 --> 02:03:44,752
Stay down!
Don't move!

1713
02:03:44,913 --> 02:03:49,031
Be advised. Clowns are hostages,
doctors are targets.

1714
02:03:55,073 --> 02:03:57,143
Ah, you made it. I'm so thrilled.

1715
02:03:57,313 --> 02:04:00,350
-Where's the detonator?
-Go get him.

1716
02:04:13,193 --> 02:04:16,151
Put down your weapon!
Don't move!

1717
02:04:46,273 --> 02:04:48,070
You don't wanna die...

1718
02:04:48,233 --> 02:04:51,145
...but you don't know how to take a life.

1719
02:04:51,313 --> 02:04:52,905
Give it to me.

1720
02:04:53,193 --> 02:04:57,345
These men will kill you
and take it anyway.

1721
02:05:00,633 --> 02:05:03,022
No one wants to get their hands dirty.

1722
02:05:03,193 --> 02:05:06,026
Fine. I'll do it.

1723
02:05:07,633 --> 02:05:10,227
Those men on that boat?
They made their choices.

1724
02:05:10,393 --> 02:05:12,588
They chose to murder and steal.

1725
02:05:12,753 --> 02:05:15,825
It doesn't make any sense
for us to have to die too.

1726
02:05:24,913 --> 02:05:27,268
All the old familiar places.

1727
02:05:33,313 --> 02:05:34,348
Stand by.

1728
02:05:44,273 --> 02:05:47,709
Red team, floor secure.
Hostages are safe.

1729
02:05:47,913 --> 02:05:49,904
Give it to me.

1730
02:05:51,273 --> 02:05:54,868
You can tell them I took it by force.

1731
02:05:55,353 --> 02:06:00,063
Give it to me, and I'll do what
you should've did 10 minutes ago.

1732
02:06:21,233 --> 02:06:24,430
We really should stop this fighting,
otherwise we'll miss the fireworks.

1733
02:06:24,593 --> 02:06:26,345
There won't be any fireworks.

1734
02:06:26,753 --> 02:06:29,825
And here we go.

1735
02:07:07,553 --> 02:07:09,384
What were you trying to prove?

1736
02:07:09,553 --> 02:07:12,386
That deep down,
everyone's as ugly as you?

1737
02:07:13,473 --> 02:07:14,462
You're alone.

1738
02:07:20,793 --> 02:07:26,072
Can't rely on anyone these days. You
gotta do everything yourself. Don't we?

1739
02:07:26,273 --> 02:07:28,992
That's okay. I came prepared.

1740
02:07:29,193 --> 02:07:33,471
It's a funny world we live in. Speaking of
which, you know how I got these scars?

1741
02:07:33,633 --> 02:07:36,352
No, but I know how you got these.

1742
02:07:53,433 --> 02:07:56,072
Oh, you.

1743
02:07:56,233 --> 02:07:59,145
You just couldn't let me go, could you?

1744
02:08:00,233 --> 02:08:03,987
This is what happens
when an unstoppable force...

1745
02:08:04,153 --> 02:08:08,431
...meets an immovable object.

1746
02:08:08,993 --> 02:08:14,192
You truly are incorruptible, aren't you?

1747
02:08:14,353 --> 02:08:16,947
Huh? You won't kill me...

1748
02:08:17,113 --> 02:08:23,109
...out of some misplaced sense
of self-righteousness.

1749
02:08:23,273 --> 02:08:26,345
And I won't kill you...

1750
02:08:26,513 --> 02:08:30,142
...because you're just too much fun.

1751
02:08:31,153 --> 02:08:35,146
I think you and I are destined
to do this forever.

1752
02:08:35,313 --> 02:08:37,224
You'll be in a padded cell forever.

1753
02:08:37,393 --> 02:08:39,145
Maybe we could share one.

1754
02:08:39,313 --> 02:08:40,712
You know,
they'll be doubling up...

1755
02:08:40,873 --> 02:08:43,307
...the rate this city's inhabitants
are losing their minds.

1756
02:08:43,473 --> 02:08:46,465
This city just showed you...

1757
02:08:46,633 --> 02:08:50,512
...that it's full of people
ready to believe in good.

1758
02:08:50,673 --> 02:08:53,710
Until their spirit breaks completely.

1759
02:08:54,553 --> 02:08:59,183
Until they get a good look
at the real Harvey Dent...

1760
02:08:59,353 --> 02:09:02,026
...and all the heroic things he's done.

1761
02:09:03,633 --> 02:09:08,468
You didn't think I'd risk losing the battle
for Gotham's soul...

1762
02:09:08,633 --> 02:09:11,431
...in a fistfight with you?

1763
02:09:11,953 --> 02:09:13,432
No.

1764
02:09:13,593 --> 02:09:16,869
You need an ace in the hole.

1765
02:09:17,033 --> 02:09:18,591
Mine's Harvey.

1766
02:09:18,953 --> 02:09:20,591
What did you do?

1767
02:09:20,753 --> 02:09:23,631
I took Gotham's white knight...

1768
02:09:23,793 --> 02:09:27,263
...and I brought him down to our level.

1769
02:09:27,673 --> 02:09:30,506
It wasn't hard.
See, madness, as you know...

1770
02:09:30,673 --> 02:09:33,585
...is like gravity.

1771
02:09:33,753 --> 02:09:35,983
All it takes is a little push.

1772
02:09:52,233 --> 02:09:53,905
Dent!

1773
02:10:14,033 --> 02:10:18,185
This is where they brought her,
Gordon, after your men handed her over.

1774
02:10:18,913 --> 02:10:20,426
This is where she died.

1775
02:10:20,593 --> 02:10:22,823
I know, I was here...

1776
02:10:23,833 --> 02:10:26,472
-...trying to save her.
-But you didn't.

1777
02:10:26,753 --> 02:10:28,425
-I couldn't.
-Yes, you could've.

1778
02:10:28,593 --> 02:10:30,026
If you'd listened to me.

1779
02:10:30,193 --> 02:10:32,707
If you stood up against corruption...

1780
02:10:32,873 --> 02:10:34,989
...instead of doing your deal
with the devil.

1781
02:10:35,153 --> 02:10:36,711
I was trying to fight the Mob!

1782
02:10:37,193 --> 02:10:41,823
You wouldn't dare try to justify yourself
if you knew what I'd lost.

1783
02:10:43,073 --> 02:10:46,065
Have you ever had to talk to the
person you loved most...

1784
02:10:46,233 --> 02:10:49,942
...tell them it's gonna be all right,
when you know it's not?

1785
02:10:51,553 --> 02:10:55,262
Well, you're about to know
what that feels like, Gordon.

1786
02:10:55,993 --> 02:10:59,702
Then you can look me in the eye
and tell me you're sorry.

1787
02:11:01,393 --> 02:11:04,829
-You're not going to hurt my family.
-No.

1788
02:11:04,993 --> 02:11:07,587
Just the person you love most.

1789
02:11:15,273 --> 02:11:18,185
So is it your wife?

1790
02:11:19,233 --> 02:11:20,825
Put the gun down, Harvey.

1791
02:11:21,193 --> 02:11:22,785
Harvey, put down the gun.

1792
02:11:22,953 --> 02:11:26,343
Please. Please, Harvey. Please.

1793
02:11:27,673 --> 02:11:28,901
Oh, goddamn it.

1794
02:11:29,073 --> 02:11:31,143
Will you stop pointing that gun
at my family?

1795
02:11:31,633 --> 02:11:33,225
No!
-We have a winner.

1796
02:11:33,393 --> 02:11:34,826
No, Jim, stop him!

1797
02:11:35,313 --> 02:11:37,065
Harvey.
Don't let him--

1798
02:11:37,233 --> 02:11:38,302
Harvey!

1799
02:11:39,633 --> 02:11:41,430
I'm sorry!

1800
02:11:43,153 --> 02:11:44,188
For everything.

1801
02:11:46,673 --> 02:11:48,789
Please don't hurt my son.

1802
02:11:58,513 --> 02:12:00,026
You brought your cops?

1803
02:12:00,193 --> 02:12:02,946
All they know is there's a situation.

1804
02:12:03,113 --> 02:12:05,991
They don't know who or what.
They're just creating a perimeter.

1805
02:12:06,153 --> 02:12:08,713
You think I wanna escape from this?

1806
02:12:08,873 --> 02:12:11,512
There is no escape from this.

1807
02:12:11,673 --> 02:12:13,709
You don't wanna hurt the boy, Harvey.

1808
02:12:15,913 --> 02:12:18,985
It's not about what I want,
it's about what's fair!

1809
02:12:19,713 --> 02:12:23,752
You thought we could be decent men
in an indecent time.

1810
02:12:26,433 --> 02:12:27,468
But you were wrong.

1811
02:12:28,153 --> 02:12:31,782
The world is cruel. And the only morality
in a cruel world...

1812
02:12:32,513 --> 02:12:34,344
...is chance.

1813
02:12:34,513 --> 02:12:36,151
Unbiased.

1814
02:12:36,353 --> 02:12:37,547
Unprejudiced.

1815
02:12:38,873 --> 02:12:39,942
Fair.

1816
02:12:40,113 --> 02:12:42,263
His son's got the same chance she had.

1817
02:12:42,993 --> 02:12:44,221
Fifty-fifty.

1818
02:12:44,393 --> 02:12:47,703
What happened to Rachel wasn't
chance. We decided to act.

1819
02:12:48,033 --> 02:12:49,307
We three.

1820
02:12:49,473 --> 02:12:52,749
Then why was it me who was
the only one who lost everything?

1821
02:12:55,153 --> 02:12:57,667
-It wasn't.
-The Joker chose me.

1822
02:12:57,833 --> 02:13:00,028
Because you were the best of us.

1823
02:13:00,193 --> 02:13:04,983
He wanted to prove that
even someone as good as you...

1824
02:13:05,153 --> 02:13:06,825
...could fall.

1825
02:13:07,153 --> 02:13:08,381
And he was right.

1826
02:13:08,553 --> 02:13:10,703
You're the one pointing the gun, Harvey.

1827
02:13:10,873 --> 02:13:13,785
So point it at the people responsible.

1828
02:13:14,713 --> 02:13:16,465
Fair enough.

1829
02:13:19,673 --> 02:13:21,470
You first.

1830
02:13:33,473 --> 02:13:35,065
My turn.

1831
02:13:41,713 --> 02:13:43,624
Harvey, you're right.

1832
02:13:44,633 --> 02:13:47,147
Rachel's death was my fault.

1833
02:13:50,113 --> 02:13:52,468
Please don't punish the boy.

1834
02:13:53,513 --> 02:13:56,585
-Please, punish me.
-I'm about to.

1835
02:13:58,473 --> 02:14:00,350
Tell your boy
he's gonna be all right, Gordon.

1836
02:14:00,793 --> 02:14:02,351
Lie...

1837
02:14:02,833 --> 02:14:03,902
...like I lied.

1838
02:14:07,513 --> 02:14:09,026
It's going to be all right, son.

1839
02:14:15,873 --> 02:14:16,467
No!

1840
02:14:45,873 --> 02:14:48,592
Dad? Daddy, is he okay?

1841
02:15:04,433 --> 02:15:06,503
-Thank you.
-You don't have to thank me.

1842
02:15:07,113 --> 02:15:08,831
Yes, I do.

1843
02:15:12,913 --> 02:15:14,187
The Joker won.

1844
02:15:16,513 --> 02:15:19,266
Harvey's prosecution,
everything he fought for...

1845
02:15:19,793 --> 02:15:21,465
...undone.

1846
02:15:21,953 --> 02:15:26,663
Whatever chance you gave us at fixing
our city dies with Harvey's reputation.

1847
02:15:26,833 --> 02:15:27,948
We bet it all on him.

1848
02:15:29,233 --> 02:15:31,986
The Joker took the best of us
and tore him down.

1849
02:15:32,553 --> 02:15:33,906
People will lose hope.

1850
02:15:34,073 --> 02:15:35,745
They won't.

1851
02:15:38,153 --> 02:15:39,950
They must never know what he did.

1852
02:15:40,113 --> 02:15:41,865
Five dead.

1853
02:15:42,153 --> 02:15:43,381
Two of them cops.

1854
02:15:43,553 --> 02:15:45,908
-You can't sweep that--
-No.

1855
02:15:50,513 --> 02:15:53,232
But the Joker cannot win.

1856
02:15:58,273 --> 02:16:01,345
Gotham needs its true hero.

1857
02:16:07,473 --> 02:16:10,385
-No.
-You either die a hero...

1858
02:16:10,553 --> 02:16:14,831
...or you live long enough
to see yourself become the villain.

1859
02:16:14,993 --> 02:16:16,745
I can do those things...

1860
02:16:17,153 --> 02:16:20,065
...because I'm not a hero, not like Dent.

1861
02:16:22,953 --> 02:16:25,706
I killed those people.
That's what I can be.

1862
02:16:25,873 --> 02:16:27,704
No, no, you can't. You're not.

1863
02:16:27,873 --> 02:16:30,341
I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be.

1864
02:16:31,953 --> 02:16:33,022
Call it in.

1865
02:16:36,193 --> 02:16:37,865
A hero.

1866
02:16:38,033 --> 02:16:41,150
Not the hero we deserved,
but the hero we needed.

1867
02:16:41,713 --> 02:16:44,147
Nothing less than a knight...

1868
02:16:44,673 --> 02:16:46,311
...shining.

1869
02:16:46,913 --> 02:16:48,471
They'll hunt you.

1870
02:16:48,633 --> 02:16:50,351
You'll hunt me.

1871
02:16:50,833 --> 02:16:52,710
You'll condemn me.

1872
02:16:53,393 --> 02:16:55,588
Set the dogs on me.

1873
02:16:59,193 --> 02:17:01,388
Because that's what needs to happen.

1874
02:17:02,513 --> 02:17:04,344
Because sometimes...

1875
02:17:04,513 --> 02:17:06,583
...the truth isn't good enough.

1876
02:17:07,433 --> 02:17:09,628
Sometimes people deserve more.

1877
02:17:12,953 --> 02:17:16,707
Sometimes people deserve
to have their faith rewarded.

1878
02:17:34,353 --> 02:17:35,945
Batman.

1879
02:17:37,793 --> 02:17:39,465
Batman!

1880
02:17:40,233 --> 02:17:42,110
Why's he running, Dad?

1881
02:17:43,113 --> 02:17:44,387
Because we have to chase him.

1882
02:17:44,553 --> 02:17:47,306
Okay, we're going in! Go, go! Move!

1883
02:17:53,153 --> 02:17:54,666
He didn't do anything wrong.

1884
02:17:57,313 --> 02:18:02,671
Because he's the hero Gotham deserves,
but not the one it needs right now.

1885
02:18:04,033 --> 02:18:05,022
So we'll hunt him...

1886
02:18:08,033 --> 02:18:10,024
...because he can take it.

1887
02:18:12,433 --> 02:18:14,822
Because he's not our hero.

1888
02:18:22,073 --> 02:18:23,222
He's a silent guardian...

1889
02:18:24,353 --> 02:18:26,150
...a watchful protector.

1890
02:18:28,553 --> 02:18:29,781
A Dark Knight.

1891
02:25:43,753 --> 02:25:56,744
