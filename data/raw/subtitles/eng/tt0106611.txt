was an Olympic bobsledder...

166
00:10:54,184 --> 00:10:57,585
who tried to get your father
to switch sports.

167
00:10:57,654 --> 00:11:02,318
He had some theory about using
track sprinters to push the bobsled.

168
00:11:02,392 --> 00:11:05,657
Some ridiculous thing like that.
Can you imagine,

169
00:11:05,729 --> 00:11:08,596
a Jamaican bobsledder?

170
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:14,031
- And you sure this man,
he lives on the island?
- Oh, yes.

171
00:11:14,104 --> 00:11:16,902
- Mr. Coolidge, thanks a lot.
- Good, Derice.

172
00:11:16,974 --> 00:11:20,535
- Oh. Could I borrow this picture?
- Bring it back.

173
00:11:20,611 --> 00:11:22,943
Yes. Thanks a lot,
Mr. Coolidge.

174
00:11:23,013 --> 00:11:25,709
- Oh. Just one more thing.
- Hmm?

175
00:11:25,783 --> 00:11:28,946
What's a bobsled?

176
00:11:30,487 --> 00:11:32,751
That's a bobsled!

177
00:11:32,823 --> 00:11:36,691
Oh! So a bobsled is
a pushcart with no wheels.

178
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:40,355
- That's what it looks like here.
- Let me see that.

179
00:11:44,201 --> 00:11:47,534
All right. "The key elements
for a successful sled team...

180
00:11:47,604 --> 00:11:52,098
are a steady driver and three strong
runners to push off down the ice."

181
00:11:52,176 --> 00:11:55,441
Ice! Ice!

182
00:11:55,512 --> 00:12:00,973
Well... it's kind of
a winter sport, you know.

183
00:12:01,051 --> 00:12:05,215
- You mean winter as in ice?
- Maybe.

184
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:09,282
You mean winter as in igloos
and Eskimos and penguins and ice?

185
00:12:09,359 --> 00:12:12,760
- Possibly.
- See ya.

186
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,628
- Where you goin'?
- I'm gonna take a hot bath.

187
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:17,826
I'm gettin' cold just thinkin'
about all this ice.

188
00:12:17,901 --> 00:12:20,461
No, man! You're gonna be
part of my bobsled team.

189
00:12:20,537 --> 00:12:22,471
What you need me for?

190
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:25,372
Who... is the best
pushcart driver...

191
00:12:25,442 --> 00:12:28,206
- In all of Jamaica?
- You're lookin' at him!

192
00:12:28,278 --> 00:12:31,213
- Then you're gonna do it?
- No!

193
00:12:31,281 --> 00:12:33,442
Hey, man, you could be famous.

194
00:12:33,517 --> 00:12:37,112
You could have your picture
on a Wheaties box.

195
00:12:37,187 --> 00:12:40,987
But you said no, and that's all right
because I don't need ya.

196
00:12:41,058 --> 00:12:44,687
Everybody is gonna want to be
on my bobsled team.

197
00:12:44,761 --> 00:12:48,060
Look, star, let me tell you
a little somethin', all right?

198
00:12:48,131 --> 00:12:51,589
When you need something from me, you
don't have to hand me a bunch of lines.

199
00:12:51,668 --> 00:12:54,102
All you have to do is
look at me in the eye and say,

200
00:12:54,171 --> 00:12:56,230
"Sanka, you are my best friend.

201
00:12:56,306 --> 00:12:59,434
We've been through a whole heap together
and I really, really need you."

202
00:13:01,778 --> 00:13:03,643
Sanka, you're right.

203
00:13:03,714 --> 00:13:07,172
And you are my best friend. And we've
been through a whole lot together.

204
00:13:07,251 --> 00:13:11,051
- Heap. Heap.
- Sorry, man. A whole heap together.

205
00:13:11,121 --> 00:13:13,351
And I really, really need you.

206
00:13:13,423 --> 00:13:16,722
- And I really, really need you.
- Forget it!

207
00:13:16,793 --> 00:13:18,988
- But you just said if I said that, man...
- All right, all right,

208
00:13:19,062 --> 00:13:20,996
all right.

209
00:13:21,064 --> 00:13:22,998
All right, man.

210
00:13:23,066 --> 00:13:25,330
[Sanka] So, let's talk
about this "billsled" team.

211
00:13:25,402 --> 00:13:28,269
- [Derice] No. Bobsled team.
- Whoever.

212
00:13:28,338 --> 00:13:32,035
[Sanka] Now about the Wheaties box.
I'm gonna be on it by myself, right?

213
00:13:32,109 --> 00:13:34,373
No, man, you're gonna be
on it with me.

214
00:13:34,444 --> 00:13:36,776
[Man On Radio] And down the stretch
they come! Tumbleweed is holding on...

215
00:13:36,847 --> 00:13:39,213
- As Captain Video is still
running on the outside.
- Yes, Tumbleweed, yes!

216
00:13:39,283 --> 00:13:41,751
...is dropping back
as Tumbleweed holds the rail.
- Come on! That's it!

217
00:13:41,818 --> 00:13:44,048
Good Tumbleweed!
Good Tumbleweed!

218
00:13:44,121 --> 00:13:47,579
- Tumbleweed is slowing!
- No, Tumbleweed, no! Bad Tumbleweed!

219
00:13:47,658 --> 00:13:51,116
- What are you doin'?
- Tumbleweed can't hold it as he
gets pinned against the rail.

220
00:13:51,194 --> 00:13:54,789
Don't do that!
Let him out!

221
00:13:54,865 --> 00:13:56,890
- Tumbleweed is running gamely,
but Captain Video...
- Don't! I need this one!

222
00:13:56,967 --> 00:13:58,901
- Is just a little bit too strong.
- Please! Come on!

223
00:13:58,969 --> 00:14:01,096
- Here they come! Yes!
- No!

224
00:14:01,171 --> 00:14:03,435
Tumbleweed can't hold it
as Captain Video takes charge.

225
00:14:03,507 --> 00:14:06,874
- And it's Brewster finishing
in second. Susan's Pride...
- What?

226
00:14:06,944 --> 00:14:09,310
finishes third and Tumbleweed
is nowhere in sight.

227
00:14:09,379 --> 00:14:13,611
But my, oh, my, the odds-on
favorite showed his true colors
with that late stretch run.

228
00:14:13,684 --> 00:14:16,517
- Uh-huh.
- Tumbleweed held on momentarily,
but realistically,

229
00:14:16,586 --> 00:14:19,248
only a fool would put
their money on Tumbleweed.

230
00:14:19,323 --> 00:14:23,123
- That horse had no chance whatsoev...
- Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh!

231
00:14:23,193 --> 00:14:25,923
Uh-huh! Uh-huh!

232
00:14:25,996 --> 00:14:28,590
That guy won two gold medals?

233
00:14:31,101 --> 00:14:34,696
I think so.

234
00:14:34,771 --> 00:14:38,707
[Sighs]

235
00:14:38,775 --> 00:14:42,802
That's Tumbleweed gone.
Okay, next race.

236
00:14:46,249 --> 00:14:49,582
Excuse, me.
Are you Mr. Irving Blitzer?

237
00:14:49,653 --> 00:14:51,814
Well, that depends
on who's asking.

238
00:14:51,888 --> 00:14:55,688
My name is Derice Bannock.
This is my teammate, Sanka Coffie.

239
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:57,920
Greetings, sled god.

240
00:14:57,995 --> 00:15:00,122
We were just wondering
if you'd be interested...

241
00:15:00,197 --> 00:15:04,327
in coaching the first
Jamaican bobsled team.

242
00:15:04,401 --> 00:15:07,666
Derice, remember the radio?
Radio?

243
00:15:07,738 --> 00:15:10,764
Stick. Shooting
with the stick. Let's go!

244
00:15:10,841 --> 00:15:13,207
Let's go, Derice!

245
00:15:25,989 --> 00:15:28,321
Come on, coach.

246
00:15:28,392 --> 00:15:31,657
Just help me get started.

247
00:15:31,728 --> 00:15:33,696
[Derice Groans]

248
00:15:42,339 --> 00:15:44,330
- Oh!
- Greetings, sled god.

249
00:15:44,408 --> 00:15:48,504
- Sorry to bother you, but you're
the only one who can help us.
- Get out! Get out!

250
00:15:48,578 --> 00:15:52,514
[Sighs, Groans]

251
00:15:52,582 --> 00:15:54,516
[Toilet Flushing]

252
00:15:56,853 --> 00:16:00,118
- Go away.
- Okay.

253
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:02,454
Nice to meet you!

254
00:16:02,526 --> 00:16:05,859
- Maybe today is a bad day.
- Yeah.

255
00:16:05,929 --> 00:16:10,832
I'll come back tomorrow.
And the next day. And the next day.

256
00:16:10,901 --> 00:16:14,337
- No! Look, whatever your name is...
- Derice.

257
00:16:14,404 --> 00:16:17,896
All right, Derice. Let me lay out
some difficulties for you.

258
00:16:17,974 --> 00:16:22,570
Snow. You don't have any.
It's 900 degrees out there.

259
00:16:22,646 --> 00:16:26,446
Time. You don't have any.
The Olympics are in three months.

260
00:16:26,516 --> 00:16:30,077
And me. You don't have me.

261
00:16:30,153 --> 00:16:33,554
As far as I'm concerned, the sport
of bobsledding no longer exists.

262
00:16:33,623 --> 00:16:36,148
I don't want to do it,
I don't want to coach it,

263
00:16:36,226 --> 00:16:39,491
and most of all,
and I mean most of all,

264
00:16:39,563 --> 00:16:43,829
I don't want to be within
2,000 miles of anyone who does.

265
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,834
Now, did you follow all that?

266
00:16:45,902 --> 00:16:48,462
Then how come you still have
that poster on the wall?

267
00:16:51,074 --> 00:16:54,407
Is that what's bothering you?

268
00:16:57,114 --> 00:17:01,517
There. Is that better?
Are you happy?

269
00:17:08,825 --> 00:17:12,852
Like I said...
my name is Derice Bannock.

270
00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:15,921
I'm Ben Bannock's son.

271
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:23,027
I haven't seen this picture
in 20 years.

272
00:17:23,106 --> 00:17:27,133
Huh. Would you look at me then?

273
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:30,145
Whoo. Would you look at me now.

274
00:17:30,213 --> 00:17:34,115
Please, Mr. Blitzer,
just give me a chance.

275
00:17:34,184 --> 00:17:37,449
If I don't have what it takes,
we'll forget the whole thing.

276
00:17:37,521 --> 00:17:40,046
Believe me, kid,
you do not have what it takes.

277
00:17:40,123 --> 00:17:42,921
- But you thought my father did.
- Your father was one of...

278
00:17:42,993 --> 00:17:46,326
the toughest competitors I ever saw.

279
00:17:46,396 --> 00:17:49,661
He ran the 100 meters in ten-flat.

280
00:17:49,733 --> 00:17:52,793
Well, I run it in nine-nine.

281
00:17:54,871 --> 00:17:58,932
Come on. Coach me.

282
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:04,276
Sorry.
You're a couple decades late.

283
00:18:04,347 --> 00:18:07,475
Oh, I see. It might be easy
for you to walk away from me,

284
00:18:07,551 --> 00:18:10,452
Mr. Blitzer, but you can't
walk away from this:

285
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,647
Twenty years ago
you came down here to see...

286
00:18:12,722 --> 00:18:15,816
if you could make a Jamaican sprinter
into a bobsledder,

287
00:18:15,892 --> 00:18:18,292
and you never got that chance.

288
00:18:18,361 --> 00:18:22,457
Look at me, Mr. Blitzer.
I'm your chance.

289
00:18:22,532 --> 00:18:24,625
Take it.

290
00:18:29,105 --> 00:18:31,039
[Exhaling]

291
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:34,268
- [Crowd Chattering]
- " [Reggae]

292
00:18:35,745 --> 00:18:38,145
All right.
Everyone quiet down.

293
00:18:38,215 --> 00:18:42,117
Nice group here.
Now, for two of you lucky people,

294
00:18:42,185 --> 00:18:45,882
our trip to the Olympics
starts right now.

295
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:51,590
And I want to introduce you...
to Mr. Irving Blitzer...

296
00:18:51,661 --> 00:18:55,119
who's going to be
our expert bobsled coach.

297
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,168
Sanka. Hit it, man.

298
00:18:59,236 --> 00:19:03,730
You're on the air, sled god.

299
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:07,072
Gentlemen, a bobsled
is a simple thing.

300
00:19:07,143 --> 00:19:09,077
[Man]
Yeah, so's a toilet!

301
00:19:09,145 --> 00:19:11,705
[Crowd Laughing]

302
00:19:11,781 --> 00:19:15,774
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Basically, what you're looking to do...

303
00:19:15,852 --> 00:19:21,222
is get your sorry rear ends from the top
of an icy chute to the bottom.

304
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:24,783
You're ziggin', you're zaggin'.

305
00:19:24,861 --> 00:19:28,888
It's the biggest, coldest
roller coaster you've ever been on.

306
00:19:30,634 --> 00:19:32,659
Ice.

307
00:19:34,437 --> 00:19:37,099
Oooh. Ooh.
[Chuckles]

308
00:19:37,173 --> 00:19:41,542
[Irv]
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

309
00:19:41,611 --> 00:19:44,512
I almost forgot, uh...

310
00:19:44,581 --> 00:19:47,744
One minor drawback
to this delightful winter sport...

311
00:19:47,817 --> 00:19:50,411
is the high-speed crash.

312
00:19:50,487 --> 00:19:52,751
That hurt. Ah.

313
00:19:52,822 --> 00:19:57,282
Always remember, your bones
will not break in a bobsled.

314
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,385
No, no. They shatter.

315
00:20:01,998 --> 00:20:04,466
Eee!

316
00:20:06,503 --> 00:20:10,337
So... who wants in?

317
00:20:24,788 --> 00:20:28,053
Look. Baldy's here.

318
00:20:28,124 --> 00:20:30,149
Glad you could make it, man.

319
00:20:30,226 --> 00:20:35,095
- Don't touch me!
- No problem.

320
00:20:35,165 --> 00:20:38,328
- So what's your name?
- Yul Brenner.

321
00:20:41,504 --> 00:20:44,996
Well, it's good to have you
as a teammate, Brenner.

322
00:20:45,075 --> 00:20:47,908
Let's get one thing straight,
Bannock.

323
00:20:47,977 --> 00:20:52,641
We may be on the same team,
but I am no one's teammate.

324
00:20:52,716 --> 00:20:55,310
- Long as you come here to bobsled...
- Hey, listen, man,

325
00:20:55,385 --> 00:20:57,615
the only reason why I come here...

326
00:20:57,687 --> 00:21:01,282
is to get off
of this stinkin' island.

327
00:21:01,358 --> 00:21:06,421
If I have to take one of those bobsleds
to do it, then all right.

328
00:21:06,496 --> 00:21:09,431
- No problem.
- [Irv] Ah, yes.

329
00:21:09,499 --> 00:21:13,196
Yes, I have a problem. There's
no such thing as a three-man sled.

330
00:21:13,269 --> 00:21:16,363
You're one Jamaican short.

331
00:21:16,439 --> 00:21:19,533
Hey.

332
00:21:19,609 --> 00:21:22,840
The meeting start yet?
Uh-oh.

333
00:21:22,912 --> 00:21:26,211
You! I'll kill you.

334
00:21:26,282 --> 00:21:28,409
- [Derice] Wait! Hold on!
- College boy, I'll kill you!

335
00:21:28,485 --> 00:21:31,113
[Sanka] Hey, think, man, think!
Easy! Whoa! Down, boy!

336
00:21:31,187 --> 00:21:34,020
[Men Shouting, Chair Clattering]

337
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:37,526
Kill him
and we don't have a team.

338
00:21:37,594 --> 00:21:39,960
I'm not ridin'
in the same sled as that.

339
00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:42,998
He tripped me too, you know.
But in case you haven't noticed,

340
00:21:43,066 --> 00:21:45,466
there's no one else here.

341
00:21:45,535 --> 00:21:48,436
- You're crowdin' me, slinky head.
- [Chuckling]

342
00:21:48,505 --> 00:21:50,439
Slinky head.
That's a good one.

343
00:21:50,507 --> 00:21:52,975
- What are you laughing about?
- Nothing.

344
00:21:53,042 --> 00:21:57,445
If it wasn't for you, rich boy,
I'd be in the Olympics right now.

345
00:21:57,514 --> 00:22:00,108
I don't know what you all are arguing
about 'cause Derice was gonna...

346
00:22:00,183 --> 00:22:03,619
- Beat both of your butts anyway.
- What are you talkin' about?

347
00:22:03,686 --> 00:22:06,655
- How 'bout I beat your butt right now?
- How 'bout I draw a line...

348
00:22:06,723 --> 00:22:09,089
down the middle of your head
so it looks like a butt?

349
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:11,093
[Chuckling]

350
00:22:15,498 --> 00:22:17,796
Forget it, man, I'm gone.

351
00:22:17,867 --> 00:22:20,563
[Derice]
Fine. Stay here on the island.

352
00:22:20,637 --> 00:22:23,800
We're going to Canada.

353
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:31,576
All right. I'll do it.

354
00:22:31,648 --> 00:22:35,448
But you better tell
this mama's boy...

355
00:22:35,518 --> 00:22:37,884
to stay the hell away from me.

356
00:22:37,954 --> 00:22:40,354
You understand?

357
00:22:40,423 --> 00:22:43,790
No problem.

358
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:48,092
Hey, Irv.
Say hello to the first...

359
00:22:48,164 --> 00:22:50,860
Jamaican bobsled team.

360
00:22:57,607 --> 00:23:00,303
Oh, goody.

361
00:23:00,376 --> 00:23:04,745
Gentlemen,
this... is a bobsled.

362
00:23:04,814 --> 00:23:07,442
Sort of.

363
00:23:07,517 --> 00:23:10,918
- All right, here's what
we're gonna do. Yul...
- Don't touch me.

364
00:23:10,987 --> 00:23:14,923
Of course. Sorry. You're
gonna be the second middleman.

365
00:23:14,991 --> 00:23:19,087
You're strong, you're fast
and you're gonna love that seat.

366
00:23:19,162 --> 00:23:21,221
Junior,
you're the first middleman.

367
00:23:21,297 --> 00:23:25,063
You're quick, you're sharp.
Hop in. Sanka.

368
00:23:25,134 --> 00:23:28,103
- I know. I'm the driver, right?
- No, you're the brakeman.

369
00:23:28,171 --> 00:23:32,540
- No, no, I'm the driver.
- No, you're not. You're the brakeman.

370
00:23:32,609 --> 00:23:35,942
- I'm the driver.
- You're not. You're the brakeman.

371
00:23:36,012 --> 00:23:37,980
You don't understand.
I am Sanka Coffie.

372
00:23:38,047 --> 00:23:40,641
I'm the best pushcart driver
in all of Jamaica.

373
00:23:40,717 --> 00:23:44,278
I must drive.
Do you dig where I'm coming from?

374
00:23:44,354 --> 00:23:46,288
- Yeah, I dig where you're coming from.
- Good.

375
00:23:46,356 --> 00:23:49,450
Now dig where I'm coming from.
I'm coming from two gold medals.

376
00:23:49,526 --> 00:23:53,018
I'm coming from nine world records
in both the two and four-man events.

377
00:23:53,096 --> 00:23:55,792
I'm coming from ten years
of intense competition...

378
00:23:55,865 --> 00:23:58,265
with the best athletes
in the world.

379
00:23:58,334 --> 00:24:00,564
That's a hell of a place
to be comin' from.

380
00:24:00,637 --> 00:24:04,198
You see, Sanka, the driver
has to work harder than anyone.

381
00:24:04,274 --> 00:24:06,834
He's the first to show up
and the last to leave.

382
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:09,140
When his teammates
are all out drinkin' beer,

383
00:24:09,212 --> 00:24:12,010
he's up in his room
studying pictures of turns.

384
00:24:12,081 --> 00:24:16,711
You see, a driver must remain
focused 100% at all times.

385
00:24:16,786 --> 00:24:20,847
Not only is he responsible for knowing
every inch of every course he races,

386
00:24:20,924 --> 00:24:24,451
he's also responsible for the lives
of the other three people in his sled.

387
00:24:26,095 --> 00:24:28,563
Now, do you want
that responsibility?

388
00:24:28,631 --> 00:24:30,724
I say we make Derice
the driver.

389
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,236
So do l, Sanka. So do I.

390
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:37,831
[Sighs]

391
00:24:39,008 --> 00:24:41,499
Oh. The back is nice.

392
00:24:41,578 --> 00:24:45,173
[Junior]
All right, Father, listen here.

393
00:24:45,248 --> 00:24:50,083
Ya see, I've made up my mind.
I am going to be a bobsledder.

394
00:24:50,153 --> 00:24:53,350
That's right. A bobsledder.

395
00:24:53,423 --> 00:24:56,586
- [Dog Barks, Whines]
- Oh, really?

396
00:24:56,659 --> 00:24:59,890
Well, I'm sorry
you feel that way.

397
00:24:59,963 --> 00:25:05,401
Fine. Cut off my allowance,
because you see, Father,

398
00:25:05,468 --> 00:25:09,871
a man has got to do
what a man has got to do.

399
00:25:12,609 --> 00:25:15,703
[Car Horn Honking]

400
00:25:20,283 --> 00:25:24,276
- Just who I want to see.
- M-M-Me?

401
00:25:24,354 --> 00:25:28,222
- You know where I just came from?
- W-Where?

402
00:25:28,291 --> 00:25:33,456
I got you a job.
With Webster, Webster and Cohen,

403
00:25:33,529 --> 00:25:35,895
the biggest brokerage house in Miami.

404
00:25:35,965 --> 00:25:38,559
Oh, right.
Webster, Webster and Cohen.

405
00:25:38,635 --> 00:25:42,628
[Chuckling] That's right.
And you start end of the month.

406
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:48,071
- Yes, but I thought that I would...
- Look.

407
00:25:48,144 --> 00:25:52,103
We went along with
this track nonsense long enough.

408
00:25:52,181 --> 00:25:56,311
And we agreed that it's time
to get on with your real future.

409
00:25:56,386 --> 00:25:58,684
Right?

410
00:25:58,755 --> 00:26:01,656
- I know...
- Right?

411
00:26:01,724 --> 00:26:04,420
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

412
00:26:04,494 --> 00:26:07,520
[Chuckles]

413
00:26:07,597 --> 00:26:11,328
I'm gonna tell your mother.
[Chuckling]

414
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:25,738
- I guess we sure told him.
- [Whining]

415
00:26:25,882 --> 00:26:30,012
Winning a bobsled race is about
one thing: the push start.

416
00:26:30,086 --> 00:26:34,785
Now I know you dainty little
track stars think you're fast.

417
00:26:34,857 --> 00:26:40,090
Well, heh, let's see how fast you are
when you push a 600-pound sled.

418
00:26:40,163 --> 00:26:44,600
Now a respectable start time
is 5.7 seconds.

419
00:26:44,667 --> 00:26:47,693
If you speed demons can't
whip off an even six-flat,

420
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:50,568
then you have a better chance of
becoming a barbershop quartet.

421
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,733
[Groaning]

422
00:26:52,809 --> 00:26:55,004
Derice, come on! Hey!

423
00:26:55,078 --> 00:26:59,981
- Junior, get in. Never mind.
- Ow!

424
00:27:00,049 --> 00:27:02,210
- [Laughing]
- Come on, fellas,
move it back. Let's go!

425
00:27:02,285 --> 00:27:07,052
' Here on this mountain top
oh-oh '

426

- 14.3. No good.
- ' I've got some wild, wild life '

427
00:27:09,792 --> 00:27:12,955
- 13.5. 11.7.
- ' I've got some bills to pay, oh-oh '

428
00:27:13,029 --> 00:27:15,759
This is what it's all about.
This is where you win or lose the race.

429
00:27:15,832 --> 00:27:18,460
Right here in the push start.
This is where you're gonna practice,

430
00:27:18,534 --> 00:27:21,002
right here, right here in a Volkswagen,
you're gonna practice.

431
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:23,664
- [Yelling]
- No! Junior, quit falling down.

432
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:27,198
Come on, hustle!
Catch up to them. There you go.

433
00:27:27,276 --> 00:27:30,211
Whoa. No! Do it again.

434
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:34,648
[Sanka] Whoa, whoa. Stop, Derice!
Stop! Wait for me! Wait!

435
00:27:34,717 --> 00:27:37,550
I'm in! Stop!
Slow down!

436
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,713
[Yelling, Crashing]

437
00:27:39,789 --> 00:27:42,849
Great. Very good.
Try it again.

438
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:48,121
If I've said it once,
I've said it 46 times:

439
00:27:48,197 --> 00:27:51,758
Cold weather endurance is vital
to building a successful sled team.

440
00:27:55,171 --> 00:27:57,639
Cold enough?
[Chuckling]

441
00:27:59,542 --> 00:28:04,138
One, two, three!

442
00:28:04,213 --> 00:28:07,580
[All]
Aaaah!

- [Sanka] Go! Go! Go!

444
00:28:19,095 --> 00:28:21,962
- ' Here on this mountain top '
- [Sanka] Whoa! Slow down!

445
00:28:22,031 --> 00:28:24,522
- ' Oh-oh "
- [Derice] Sanka, hit the brakes, man!

446
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,125
- I can't! It's stuck!
- [Derice] Hold on!

447
00:28:27,203 --> 00:28:29,068
Look out!

448
00:28:29,138 --> 00:28:33,575

- Sanka, you dead?
- [Groaning]

452
00:28:48,658 --> 00:28:52,287
Yeah, man.

453
00:28:52,361 --> 00:28:56,593
[Man] What have you done to the
police unit? I should arrest you.

454
00:28:56,666 --> 00:29:00,067
- [Man #2] Who owns this thing?
- We do, sir.

455
00:29:00,136 --> 00:29:04,004
- And who are you?
- The Jamaican bobsled team, sir.

5.9! 5.9! You did it!
You did it! 5.9!

459
00:29:15,418 --> 00:29:19,377
We did it! We did it! 5.9!
Get outta the way! Get outta the way!

460
00:29:19,455 --> 00:29:21,480
5.9, guys! What?

461
00:29:21,557 --> 00:29:24,526
- Who are you?
- I'm their coach. You guys okay?

00:29:24,594 --> 00:29:27,392
- Yeah, man.
- [Irv] How's the sled?

463
00:29:27,463 --> 00:29:29,397
Sled's okay?
Well, it's in the wrong place.

464
00:29:29,465 --> 00:29:32,366
Get it back to the top of the hill!
Let's move it right now, you slackers!

465
00:29:32,435 --> 00:29:36,428
- Move it! Let's hustle!
Come on, you guys, move it!
- [Team Groaning]

466
00:29:36,505 --> 00:29:37,938
[Thunder Rumbling]

467
00:29:38,007 --> 00:29:41,272
[Irv] I'm not asking
for a winter sports program.

468
00:29:41,344 --> 00:29:45,872
All I need is a lousy 20 grand so I
can get us to the Olympics. That's all.

469
00:29:45,948 --> 00:29:48,849
[Coolidge] How in God's name
are you going to get to the Olympics?

470
00:29:48,918 --> 00:29:51,443
These boys have never even
seen a sled race before.

471
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,354
Mr. Coolidge, I have been looking
at sledders since I was 12 years old.

472
00:29:55,424 --> 00:29:59,451
If I say these kids
can make it to the Olympics,
they can make it to the Olympics.

473
00:29:59,528 --> 00:30:03,020
Okay. Well, I'll
tell you what we'll do.

474
00:30:03,099 --> 00:30:05,397
Practice down here
with the boys a bit more,

475
00:30:05,468 --> 00:30:08,198
and when you're a little further along,
I'll come along and see you...

476
00:30:08,271 --> 00:30:12,708
- No! No, no!
- Now just a minute, Mr. Blitzer!

477
00:30:12,775 --> 00:30:15,266
This country enjoys
a fine athletic tradition.

478
00:30:15,344 --> 00:30:17,676
And if you think I'm gonna give you
the little money we have...

479
00:30:17,747 --> 00:30:21,274
so that you can parade us around
in front of the world like a freak show,

480
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:23,648
you've got another thing coming.

481
00:30:23,719 --> 00:30:26,517
It's bad enough how you
embarrassed your own country.

482
00:30:26,589 --> 00:30:29,080
I'm certainly not gonna
allow you to embarrass ours.

483
00:30:31,594 --> 00:30:34,893
No go, kid.

484
00:30:34,964 --> 00:30:37,296
That's okay, coach.
We'll get the money.

485
00:30:37,366 --> 00:30:40,028
Do the words "give up"

00:46:30,418 --> 00:46:33,182
For your first run,
I'm just gonna nudge you off.

647
00:46:33,255 --> 00:46:36,315
Okay, everybody in. Let's go,
let's go. Come on, come on.

648
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:40,421
- [Yul] Don't touch me.
- Hey, baldy, get off my foot.

649
00:46:40,495 --> 00:46:42,429
- Don't touch me!
- Here we go. Come on.

650
00:46:42,497 --> 00:46:47,264
Hey, Blitzer. Why don't you put
some training wheels on that sled?

651
00:46:47,335 --> 00:46:51,203
- [Crowd Laughing]
- That's funny. Ha-ha. Very funny.

652
00:46:51,273 --> 00:46:55,903
- You want to kiss my egg?
- I'm not kissin' no egg.

653
00:46:55,977 --> 00:46:58,411
- Suit yourself.
- [Irv] Listen up, fellas.

654
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,540
- I don't want you to worry
about lookin' good out there.
- Ah, Blitzy.

655
00:47:01,616 --> 00:47:05,552
You're going to tuck them in too?

656
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:08,555
Hey. Seemin' to you
like nobody likes us?

657
00:47:08,623 --> 00:47:12,889
We're different. People
always afraid of what's different.

658
00:47:12,961 --> 00:47:15,293
Hey, Jamaica!

659
00:47:15,363 --> 00:47:18,491
Watch out for number 12 turn.
It's scary, ja?

660
00:47:18,566 --> 00:47:19,999
Oooh!

661
00:47:20,068 --> 00:47:22,229
What's his problem?

662
00:47:22,304 --> 00:47:25,432
He's Josef Grool. He's one
of the best drivers in the world.

663
00:47:25,507 --> 00:47:28,374
Yeah, he's one of the biggest
assholes in the world too.

664
00:47:28,443 --> 00:47:32,504
Don't listen to him; you listen to me.
Derice, right here. You got it?

665
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:36,710
Remember, keep your hands soft
and your mind clear.

666
00:47:36,785 --> 00:47:40,778
- High in, low out. What is it?
- High in, low out.

667
00:47:40,855 --> 00:47:43,881
All right, put your helmets on,
everybody. Let's go.

668
00:47:43,959 --> 00:47:45,984
Here we go, come on.
Helmets on.

669
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:50,464
- Hey, coach?
- Yeah.

670
00:47:50,532 --> 00:47:52,727
I cannot get my helmet on.

671
00:47:52,801 --> 00:47:55,599
- Thanks, coach.
- That's what I'm here for.

672
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:59,265
- Oh, coach? L-I gotta go. You know.
- Yeah?

673
00:47:59,341 --> 00:48:00,933
- Hold it!
- Hold it?

674
00:48:01,009 --> 00:48:04,035
- Hold it! Yeah, hold it!
- Hold it?

675
00:48:04,112 --> 00:48:07,741
B-But, coach, l, I can't hold it.
We're not bobsledding yet.

676
00:48:07,816 --> 00:48:11,912
- Oh, yes, we are.
- Coach! Coach!

677
00:48:16,358 --> 00:48:18,986
Coach! Coach!

678
00:48:22,697 --> 00:48:25,359
[P.A.]
On the track.

679
00:48:28,903 --> 00:48:32,737
[Sanka]
Coach! Aaaaah!

680
00:48:35,543 --> 00:48:38,410
[Sanka]
Aaaaah!

681
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,472
Slow down! Oh!
Slow down! Slow down!

682
00:48:41,549 --> 00:48:45,781
Oh, my God! Oh! Oh, Derice!
Oh, Derice! I hate you!

683
00:48:45,854 --> 00:48:50,621
I hate you!
I hate you! Ohhhh!

684
00:48:50,692 --> 00:48:54,321
[Sanka Yelling]

685
00:48:54,396 --> 00:48:58,992
[Crashing]

686
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:05,467
[Derice]
Sanka, you dead?

687
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:08,202
Yeah, man.

688
00:49:08,276 --> 00:49:12,337
Well, you can pee now.

689
00:49:12,414 --> 00:49:14,609
Oh, too late.

690
00:49:17,185 --> 00:49:19,176
This is embarrassing.

691
00:49:22,924 --> 00:49:24,357
[Coughing]

692
00:49:24,426 --> 00:49:27,827
[Yul] Man, shut down
that hot plate, fool.

693
00:49:27,896 --> 00:49:30,194
Those bananas are stinkin'
like a dead dog.

694
00:49:30,265 --> 00:49:34,395
Back off, back off, you eight ball!
This is my mama's secret recipe.

695
00:49:34,469 --> 00:49:38,701
And I hope you don't mind keepin' quiet
while I catch up on my reading.

696
00:49:38,773 --> 00:49:41,901
What are you talkin' about, readin'?
This is a children's book.

697
00:49:41,976 --> 00:49:44,467
- Oh, is that so?
- Yes, that's so.

698
00:49:44,546 --> 00:49:47,982
If that's a children's book, that mean's
it's too advanced for the likes of you.

699
00:49:48,049 --> 00:49:52,884
What are you trying to say? That I'm
not smarter than a little child?

700
00:49:52,954 --> 00:49:56,412
No. What I am saying to you is that you
are the kind of club-totin'...

701
00:49:56,491 --> 00:49:59,051
raw meat-eatin',
me-Tarzan-you-Janein',

702
00:49:59,127 --> 00:50:01,925
big, bald bubblehead
that can only count to ten...

703
00:50:01,996 --> 00:50:04,021
if he's barefoot
or wearing sandals.

704
00:50:04,099 --> 00:50:06,363
Say whatever it is
that you want.

705
00:50:06,434 --> 00:50:10,564
Because you're just like
every other fool on the island.

706
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:17,007
You're going nowhere, Sanka,
and you're thrilled to death about it.

707
00:50:18,346 --> 00:50:21,406
But you see me?
You see me?

708
00:50:21,483 --> 00:50:25,852
I'm different
'cause I know exactly...

709
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,047
where I'm going.

710
00:50:28,123 --> 00:50:30,489
And after l, Yul Brenner,

711
00:50:30,558 --> 00:50:33,823
win the Olympics
and become famous,

712
00:50:33,895 --> 00:50:36,989
I'm gonna leave the island...

713
00:50:37,065 --> 00:50:41,434
and live right down there.

714
00:50:41,503 --> 00:50:44,939
[Laughing]

715
00:50:45,006 --> 00:50:46,940
What are you laughing about?

716
00:50:47,008 --> 00:50:50,068
- What are you laughing about?
- That's Buckingham Palace.

717
00:50:50,145 --> 00:50:55,606
You plan on livin' there,
you're gonna have to marry the Queen.

718
00:50:55,683 --> 00:50:58,811
Yul, that's where
the Queen of England lives.

719
00:51:03,758 --> 00:51:07,922
[Sanka] Face it, Yul Brenner.
You can start callin' yourself Madonna,

720
00:51:07,996 --> 00:51:12,797
but you're still gonna
end up in an outhouse shanty
like every other dockworking nobody.

721
00:51:12,867 --> 00:51:16,394
- Says who?
- Says me, rich boy.
What you know about it?

722
00:51:16,471 --> 00:51:19,497
Well, I know my father
started off in a one-room hut.

723
00:51:19,574 --> 00:51:22,065
Now, he lives in one of
the biggest homes in Kingston.

724
00:51:22,143 --> 00:51:25,772
- Well, he ain't your father.
- He doesn't have to be.

725
00:51:25,847 --> 00:51:30,341
All he has to do is know what he wants
and work hard for it.

726
00:51:30,418 --> 00:51:33,785
And if he wants it bad enough,
he'll get it.

727
00:51:33,855 --> 00:51:37,814
Look, believe me, Sanka,

728
00:51:37,892 --> 00:51:41,658
the more Yul Brenners we got
makin' it in this world,

729
00:51:41,729 --> 00:51:43,959
the better off this world would be.

730
00:51:44,032 --> 00:51:47,991
Especially for Jamaicans.

731
00:52:02,817 --> 00:52:06,878
Go ahead, Yul Brenner.
You go get your palace.

732
00:52:18,066 --> 00:52:20,466
[Yelling]

733
00:52:20,535 --> 00:52:22,526
Move, move!

734
00:52:22,604 --> 00:52:24,538
[P.A.]
On the track.

735
00:52:30,044 --> 00:52:32,740
What do you have in there,
a baby?

736
00:52:36,417 --> 00:52:39,352
- I can't believe you're still cold, man.
- Cold?

737
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:42,753
I'm freezin' my royal,
Rastafarian nay-nays off!

738
00:52:42,824 --> 00:52:45,190
All right, we're up.
Let's go, guys. This is it.

739
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:47,194
Gimme that thing.

740
00:52:47,262 --> 00:52:50,231
Okay. Now this is
our first real push start...

741
00:52:50,298 --> 00:52:52,596
but don't worry about it, okay?

742
00:52:52,667 --> 00:52:55,192
l-lt's no different
than what we practiced.
We've done it a hundred times.

743
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:58,569
Derice, right here.
Okay, get your helmets on.

744
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,574
- Coach.
- Okay, okay.

745
00:53:00,642 --> 00:53:03,076
- Thanks, coach.
- All right.
Let's go, Derice. It's yours.

746
00:53:03,144 --> 00:53:06,238
- Ridiculous. What's he doing?
- [Irv] Ready!

747
00:53:06,314 --> 00:53:11,581
One, two, three.

748
00:53:11,653 --> 00:53:13,746
- [Yelling]
- Go, go, go, go!

749
00:53:13,821 --> 00:53:16,619
- [Derice] Hold on! Wait!
- Now!

750
00:53:16,691 --> 00:53:18,625
- Now! Now!
- Whoa! Look out!

751
00:53:18,693 --> 00:53:20,627
- Now.
- [Sanka Yelling]

752
00:53:43,151 --> 00:53:46,746
[Speaking German]

753
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:55,090
Those guys are pretty good,
aren't they?

754
00:53:55,163 --> 00:53:58,291
Good? They're the best.

755
00:53:58,366 --> 00:54:02,530
- So you guys been having
a little trouble out there, huh?
- Ah, we'll be fine.

756
00:54:02,603 --> 00:54:07,040
I sure hope so. It'd be a real shame
to waste all that talent.

757
00:54:07,108 --> 00:54:10,475
I'm not worried.
And we have a good coach.

758
00:54:10,545 --> 00:54:12,479
[Laughs]

759
00:54:12,547 --> 00:54:15,778
Kid, I hate to say it,
but you gotta wake up.

760
00:54:15,850 --> 00:54:18,045
Coach Blitzer's
what's killin' ya.

761
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:21,486
He's been useless
since the day he was busted.

762
00:54:21,556 --> 00:54:25,117
- What you mean, "busted"?
- The '72 Games.

763
00:54:25,193 --> 00:54:27,753
The guy hid weights in the front
of the sled to make it go faster.

764
00:54:30,298 --> 00:54:33,961
So what?
It's no big deal.

765
00:54:34,035 --> 00:54:38,199
Having your gold medals taken away
for cheating is a big deal.

766
00:54:39,907 --> 00:54:42,808
Derice, let's go.
We've got a meeting.

767
00:54:54,589 --> 00:54:58,525
Givin' my kid
a few pointers, Larry?

768
00:54:58,593 --> 00:55:01,790
Your kid's gonna need
all the help he can get.

769
00:55:06,567 --> 00:55:08,501
Coach.

770
00:55:10,638 --> 00:55:13,163
[Knocking]

771
00:55:14,776 --> 00:55:17,438
Maid service, sir.
Would you like your bed turned down?

772
00:55:17,512 --> 00:55:20,345
Mint? Perhaps I could
dust your head.

773
00:55:20,415 --> 00:55:24,715
Whatever's wrong with you...
is no little thing.

774
00:55:26,387 --> 00:55:30,346
Hurry up, man. I have a dead grandmother
that moves faster than you.

775
00:55:30,425 --> 00:55:33,519
- Wait, wait.
- [Knocking]

776
00:55:33,594 --> 00:55:37,030
What that fool want now?

777
00:55:37,098 --> 00:55:40,090
- What?
- Sorry.

778
00:55:47,241 --> 00:55:49,573
- What do you have there, man?
- A telegram.

779
00:55:49,644 --> 00:55:52,579
I know it's a telegram.
What's it say?

780
00:55:56,484 --> 00:55:58,952
From my father.

781
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:03,719
He says I have to
come home right now.

782
00:56:03,791 --> 00:56:05,725
[Sighs]

783
00:56:12,533 --> 00:56:15,127
' Workin' '

784
00:56:15,203 --> 00:56:19,071
' Workin' from payday
to payday '

785
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:23,600
' Every time payday comes
you know I'm down to my last '

786
00:56:25,246 --> 00:56:28,113
' Well, I'm dreamin' '

787
00:56:28,182 --> 00:56:31,413
' Dreamin' of you all day '

788
00:56:31,486 --> 00:56:37,152
' When the working's done we're
gonna love that night away '

789
00:56:38,726 --> 00:56:42,389
' 'Cause we're goin' nowhere
and we're gettin' there fast '

790
00:56:42,463 --> 00:56:44,761
' When we finally make it
we can both look back '

791
00:56:44,832 --> 00:56:47,232
' On these hard times '

792
00:56:47,301 --> 00:56:49,599
' Just for a laugh '

793
00:56:49,670 --> 00:56:51,934
- Hi.
- Howdy, partner.

794
00:56:52,006 --> 00:56:55,237
' 'Cause when you got love you
don't need too much money '

795
00:56:55,309 --> 00:56:58,107
' I'm in love with you
and don't you know, honey '

796
00:56:58,246 --> 00:57:01,511
' We're goin' nowhere '

797
00:57:01,582 --> 00:57:05,916
- ' And we're gettin' there fast '
- You've worked too hard and too long.

798
00:57:05,987 --> 00:57:09,047
And let me tell you
somethin' else, Junior Bevil.

799
00:57:09,123 --> 00:57:13,617
If it wasn't for you,
we wouldn't be here right now.

800
00:57:13,694 --> 00:57:16,356
Wait.
But you don't understand.

801
00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:18,557
He is really mad.

802
00:57:18,633 --> 00:57:21,101
I mean, you don't know him
like I do, you know.

803
00:57:21,168 --> 00:57:24,365
[Sighs] I think I better
just do what he wants...

804
00:57:24,438 --> 00:57:26,372
and go back home.

805
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:31,036
And forget about your teammates?
Blood fire!

806
00:57:31,112 --> 00:57:34,980
The man, you act like he's

Tallulah.

970
01:08:57,998 --> 01:09:01,798
Sounds like a two-dollar hooker.
How you come up with that?

971

Hey, you idiot,
that's my mother's name.

- It's a pretty name.
- Tallulah. I like that.

So, what's it gonna be, star?

974
01:09:11,044 --> 01:09:13,945
What are the people gonna be screamin'
when Jamaica takes the hill?

975
01:09:14,014 --> 01:09:18,246
I say we call it
"Cool runnings."

- I like it.

- It's very strong.
- Nice. Very nice.

978
01:09:22,723 --> 01:09:25,590
Uh, what exactly does it mean?

979
01:09:25,659 --> 01:09:29,060
"Cool runnings" means
"Peace be the journey."

980
01:09:29,129 --> 01:09:31,063
[Together]
Peace be the journey.

981
01:09:31,131 --> 01:09:34,464

Excuse me, Irv.
I've nothing to say to you.

991
01:10:12,673 --> 01:10:16,837
Yes, you do. I want to know
why you disqualified my guys.

992
01:10:16,910 --> 01:10:21,006
As you were told, your team must
compete in an international race
to qualify for the Olympics.

993
01:10:21,081 --> 01:10:25,484
But in an Olympic year, the qualifiers
count as an international race.

994
01:10:25,552 --> 01:10:28,385
That may have been true
in past Olympic years,

995
01:10:28,455 --> 01:10:31,913
but this year the Alliance
decided to change its policy.

996
01:10:31,992 --> 01:10:34,961
Oh, please.
Change its policy?

997
01:10:35,028 --> 01:10:39,158
The Alliance has the right to do
whatever they feel is in the best
interest of the sport.

998
01:10:39,232 --> 01:10:43,566
We must also be concerned about
the potential for embarrassment.

999
01:10:43,637 --> 01:10:45,571
Oh, forgive me.

1000
01:10:45,639 --> 01:10:49,507
I didn't realize that four black guys
in a bobsled could make you blush.

1001

I think we've heard enough.

1002
01:10:52,279 --> 01:10:55,510
Come on, Kurt. What you're doin'
is wrong and you know it.

1003
01:10:55,582 --> 01:10:59,712
Now, if this is about you and me,
then let's get it straight right now.

1004
01:10:59,786 --> 01:11:04,723
All right, 16 years ago,
I made the biggest mistake of my life.

1005
01:11:04,791 --> 01:11:08,557
I cheated. I was stupid.

1006
01:11:08,628 --> 01:11:11,995
I embarrassed myself,
my family,

1007

and my coach.

1008

If it's revenge you want,
take it.

1009
01:11:20,941 --> 01:11:23,933
Go ahead.
Disqualify me, banish me.

1010
01:11:24,010 --> 01:11:26,103
Do whatever you want,
but do it to me.

1011
01:11:26,179 --> 01:11:29,979
It was me who let you down, Kurt.
It wasn't my guys.

1012
01:11:30,050 --> 01:11:32,382
They've done everything
you've asked of them.

1013
01:11:32,452 --> 01:11:35,944
And they did it with all of you
laughing in their face.

1014
01:11:36,022 --> 01:11:40,482
Hell, it doesn't matter
if they come in first or 50th.

1015
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:43,927
Those guys have earned the right
to represent their country.

1016
01:11:43,997 --> 01:11:47,592
They've earned the right
to march into that stadium...

1017
01:11:47,667 --> 01:11:49,601
and wave their nation's flag.

1018
01:11:49,669 --> 01:11:54,197
That's the single greatest honor
an athlete could ever have.

1019
01:11:56,143 --> 01:11:59,510
That's what the Olympics
are about.

1020
01:12:00,781 --> 01:12:04,444
Sixteen years ago,
I forgot that.

1021

- Oh, it's the Alliance. God.

1028

What did they say?

1029
01:12:49,429 --> 01:12:51,693

Their flag bearer is
the sled captain Derice Bannock.

1039
01:13:24,998 --> 01:13:27,933
Derice's father, Ben Bannock,
was a gold medalist in the 200 meters...

at the Summer Olympic Games
over 20 years ago.

in two generations of this family.

That's quite a story.

01:19:44,811 --> 01:19:48,440
All right, guys, we're up. Come on. Hey,
knock it off. Knock it off, will ya?

1129
01:19:48,514 --> 01:19:51,711
Okay, let's go. Come on.
Get in your start positions.

1130
01:19:51,784 --> 01:19:55,914
We don't have to win the gold in the
first day. It's just like any other run.

something? Thank you.

[Al] The Jamaican team attempts
its first ever Winter Olympic event.

1140
01:20:22,482 --> 01:20:25,713
[Chuckling] And look at this.
They've got to get into that sled.

1141
01:20:25,785 --> 01:20:29,721
I've never seen anything
like this. I know it's not funny,
but how embarrassing.

1142
01:20:29,789 --> 01:20:32,622
Thank goodness. For a minute,
I didn't think they'd ever
get all four of them in.

1143
01:20:32,692 --> 01:20:35,320
And that could have been
a disaster.

[Cheering, Shouting]

1145
01:20:37,397 --> 01:20:40,195
[John Morgan] Well, most importantly
here, when you do get in the sled,

1146
01:20:40,266 --> 01:20:43,133
you have to get in with catlike
movements; you need to get relaxed.

1147
01:20:43,202 --> 01:20:47,161
Look at the high line in Omega!
He bounces off the wall,
ricochets like a pinball.

1148
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:50,767
The driver here, Derice Bannock, looks
like the sled's really drivin' him.

1149
01:20:50,843 --> 01:20:54,904
- That fool better watch his mouth.
- He better watch more than that.

1150
01:20:54,981 --> 01:20:58,781
This is the time when this team
may be thinking, "This may not
have been such a great idea."

1151
01:20:58,851 --> 01:21:00,944
Their heads are bouncing around.
This is amazing.

1152
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:03,784
Like rag dolls as they
come through the finish...

1153
01:21:03,856 --> 01:21:06,188
at a time of 58.04,

1154
01:21:06,259 --> 01:21:08,853
which will be good enough
for last place.

for the taking and you choked.

You were ready and you choked.

1158
01:21:23,876 --> 01:21:27,812
Well, maybe we should
go over the turns again?

1159
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:32,374
You know the turns. You know everything
there is to know about this sport.

1160
01:21:32,452 --> 01:21:34,386
I'll tell you something.

1161
01:21:34,454 --> 01:21:37,912
You had all better figure out
how to stay loose out there.

That's something
I can't help you with.

about the damn Swiss?

1167
01:22:05,418 --> 01:22:09,582
I mean, it was all that "eins,
zwei, drei" nonsense that got us
all nervous in the first place.

1168
01:22:09,655 --> 01:22:12,954
Hey, man, look here. I'm just tryin'
to get us off on the right foot.

1169
01:22:13,026 --> 01:22:16,792
Well, the right foot for us is not
the Swiss foot. I mean, come on, Derice.

1170
01:22:16,863 --> 01:22:20,355
We can't be copyin' nobody else's style.
We have our own style.

It's no stupid pushcart derby.

Let me tell ya somethin', Rasta.

1174
01:22:33,646 --> 01:22:36,638
I didn't come up here to forget
who I am and where I come from.

And neither did I.
I'm just tryin' to be the best I can be.

I can be is Jamaican.

Jeffries asked to see your ding-a-ling.

than the Swiss. That's a real
big difference from yesterday.

1205
01:24:17,083 --> 01:24:21,247
[Al] This is an absolute shock
in the making. Yesterday, they
were falling down at the start.

- Yes!
- Now they slide into place.

if you don't want to.

I'd made winning my whole life.

life, you have to keep on winning.

is a wonderful thing.

to win an Olympic medal.

an extreme case of Jamaican fever.
