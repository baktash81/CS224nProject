00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,729
Hi.

2
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:13,489
-How'd it go?
-Lousy.

3
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:17,367
Got a '63 Thunderbird
I would've sold in a day a year ago.

4
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:20,162
Now they just wanna look at the pictures.

5
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:22,998
You smell nice.

6
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:28,921
How was your day?

7
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,672
It was great.

8
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,967
We had a big breakthrough
in the Bulgari case.

9
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,178
Really?

10
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,972
We found a boot print.

11
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,517
A really good one.

12
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:45,062
The left heel was worn way down.

13
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,943
That's a good lead.

14
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,569
I know.

15
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,822
We found a hair.

16
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,448
A hair, wow.

17
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,242
It's at the lab.

18
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:02,538
So hopefully by noon tomorrow
we'll find out his DNA...

19
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:06,166
...what kind of conditioner he uses,
if he streaks his hair...

20
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:09,878
...if he has dandruff, everything.
Isn't that amazing?

21
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:12,047
That is amazing.

22
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:16,218
You know, having those
extra men really paid off.

23
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,512
Oh, you're just being modest.

24
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,223
Are you coming to bed, baby?

25
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:24,726
I'm just gonna have a shower.
Don't let me keep you up.

26
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,478
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

27
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:12,065
-And you are Mr...?
-Diaz. Miguel Diaz.

28
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:16,111
-And you're here to open a...?
-A SEP retirement account.

29
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:19,990
Terrific. Oh, it says here
you're already retired.

30
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,576
-I am.
-What was your occupation?

31
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,621
I was a high school basketball coach.

32
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:28,290
You must have done
very well for yourself.

33
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,042
-What's your name?
-Greg.

34
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:34,630
Greg. Let me ask you something.
Do you have safe-deposit boxes here?

35
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:36,798
Yes, they're housed in our vauIt.

36
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:39,760
-ln your vauIt?
-It's over 100 years old.

37
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:43,472
Of course, we've made some
state-of-the-art upgrades since then.

38
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,142
You know, I was once in a vauIt
while it was being robbed.

39
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:50,854
That must have been quite an experience.

40
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:59,821
Yeah.

41
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:13,961
That's too oxblood.

42
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,841
What do y'all do?

43
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,844
My husband and l?

44
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:27,599
Well, he's retired. Just retired.

45
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,227
It's great. It's....

46
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:34,481
And I did work at an art gallery.

47
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:39,194
And, you know, I love art'
obviously, and paint and....

48
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:42,489
That's too brown. I'm sorry.
Do you mind if l--?

49
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:45,200
-Hey, it's your paint.
-Okay. Thank you.

50
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,257
May I show you something specific?

51
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:03,552
Well, I was looking
for something for my wife.

52
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,387
What is it, a special occasion?

53
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:08,181
It's our second third anniversary.

54
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:11,643
Excuse me. Hello, Mrs. Diaz,
we were just talking about you.

55
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,855
-How'd it go at the bank?
-It was easy.

56
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,440
I mean great.

57
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,233
No, you mean easy.

58
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,818
What?

59
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,612
You're doing recon work
on our anniversary?

60
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,115
-Tess.
-Let me ask you this:

61
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:28,285
-Where are you now?
-Casing a jewelry store.

62
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:32,664
That's an interesting way to ease back
into society, which was your idea.

63
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,875
-Should I stop painting now?
-Listen.

64
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:39,046
Let's talk about something important.
I can't find a restaurant for tonight.

65
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,632
-Well, we'll stay in.
-Really?

66
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,553
-Great. I'll cook.
-No, I'll cook. You talk.

67
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,513
You want me to talk?

68
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:52,476
Words and everything? That's what
they make flowers for, you know.

69
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,982
-Oh, no, Danny.
-What is it?

70
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,110
Tess...

71
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:03,737
...what's wrong?

72
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,908
There's water in the basement
and the pilot light is out.

73
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,618
Hang up!

74
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,302
Hello, Tess.

75
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:41,691
Where is he, Tess?

76
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,237
Where is...

77
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,823
...Mr. Diaz?

78
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,667
I want it back, Tess.

79
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,710
I want it all back.

80
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:05,215
-You got it all from the insurance company.
-I want my money back.

81
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:08,677
The money that your husband
and his 10 friends stole from me.

82
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:12,639
With interest. A hundred and sixty
million dollars over three years.

83
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:14,850
That's a lot of vig.

84
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:16,685
And I want it all back.

85
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:29,030
He's got two weeks.

86
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:35,245
You'll never find them.

87
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,831
They're way too smart for you.

88
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,709
Right.

89
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,421
You know, as it turns out...

90
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:48,967
...I'm not the only person in the world
looking for Ocean's 11.

91
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,074
All right.

92
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:18,163
I'm the groom, and I'm not supposed
to say anything, but-- Make a speech.

93
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:22,792
But I don't care what the rules are,
because I really wanna thank my family.

94
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,379
My mom and dad'
my Uncle Gary and Aunt Grace.

95
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,507
Uncle Ted, Aunt Celeste...

96
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:32,594
...and their children, Denise and Jessica.

97
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:36,848
Bishop Tom and his wife, Helen,
my neighbor John...

98
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,226
...and his new girlfriend, Tanya.

99
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:42,979
And all the guys at Lean Machine lnc.,
Bobo, Mullethead...

100
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:44,898
...Big Sam.

101
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,986
And everyone else
who's just been great...

102
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:53,323
...in welcoming Sara
into the family. Thank you.

103
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:04,209
Excuse me, everybody. I'd just like to--

104
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,294
-Get up.
-Get up.

105
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,755
-Get up.
-Get up. Get up.

106
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,423
-Walk.
-Walk.

107
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:16,596
I'd like to say a few words
about commitment...

108
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,807
...about honor...

109
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,726
...about responsibility...

110
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:26,022
...about a very special someone
and admitting to her....

111
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,984
Get up. Pull the chair out.

112
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:36,032
Admitting to her in front of everybody...

113
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,493
...that her wedding...

114
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:43,331
...and that very special
honeymoon trip to Epcot Center...

115
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,501
...will have to be postponed.

116
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:53,508
The photographer. Jesus, he's just a friend.
You met him at The Mint, remember?

117
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:56,970
Well, of course I am.

118
00:09:57,138 --> 00:10:01,141
You don't expect me to embarrass myself
by flying commercial?

119
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,854
On a budget? On a budget?

120
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:10,150
Who was the only person who couldn't
get in on the Chinese cell-phone market?

121
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:13,570
You, with all your connections.
What was that?

122
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:20,535
He seemed really nice. And you know
it's hard for guys to be friends with me.

123
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:24,205
And you do this every time
that I meet someone new.

124
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:28,960
And you know what?
It's getting really boring.

125
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:49,397
You think it's a accident
no one know about Fred "Bud" Kelly?

126
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,068
Ain't no accident.
There's one explanation...

127
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:55,654
...and you ladies
know exactly what it is.

128
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,447
I'm gonna tell you what it is.

129
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:01,743
Conspiracy, collusion, complicity.
That's all it is.

130
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:05,914
Let me break it down like a fraction for you
about my man Fred "Bud" Kelly.

131
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,875
Fred "Bud" Kelly made skates
out of whiskey bottles...

132
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:13,880
...at his uncle's farm in the early 1900s.
That was over there in Nova Scotia.

133
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:18,301
I'm gonna tell you something else. You
never seen his name on the Stanley Cup.

134
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:22,263
You know why that is?
Because that son of a bitch Jim Crow...

135
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:25,809
...took his name off the history books.
You kind of--

136
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:29,813
Seems like every time I see you,
you're playing the race card, Frank.

137
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,773
Now, why is that?

138
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,984
You can let go of my feet now.

139
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:44,452
-This don't bother you?
-Of course it ******* bothers me, mate.

140
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:48,081
-What the **** do you want me to do?
-Well, it's ****** up.

141
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,041
You can't hear none of the lyrics.

142
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:53,628
You can't get with the beat
with all them ******* bleeps in it.

143
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:57,924
You want a ******* single on the *******
radio, it's What you have to ******* do.

144
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,468
Well, it's ******, isn't it?
Totally ******!

145
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:03,096
******* right, it's ******* ******.

146
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,725
What the **** is that?

147
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:10,061
Somebody must be in 2.

148
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,650
Oh, ****!

149
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:23,658
And you haven't contacted
my father about any of this?

150
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:28,288
Because, really, I don't think there's
any reason to involve him or my mom.

151
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:36,337
It's all on you, Linus.

152
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,674
Okay. Good.

153
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,887
-Good. Because I have a whole network--
-Get out of my car.

154
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,680
Thank you.

155
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,560
-Mr. Bloom?
-Yes.

156
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:53,438
There appears to be
a slight problem with your card.

157
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,235
Oh, well, yes. Here.

158
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:00,987
I'm afraid not, sir.

159
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,614
Why?

160
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,325
Your business manager
said you would understand.

161
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,535
Todd said I would understand?

162
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:10,580
No, Mr. Benedict.

163
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:15,251
Mr. Benedict. Mr....

164
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,253
Oh, yes.

165
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,422
An old friend, a practical joker.

166
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,884
Tell Mr. Benedict
he's won this round, yes.

167
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,637
Terry Benedict.

168
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:28,848
Old Terry.

169
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:31,518
She's looking at me
from across the room.

170
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:34,270
And she's crazy about me, I can tell...

171
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:38,817
...because she's been staring
at me all night. So suddenly...

172
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:42,070
...I just go up to her, and I grab her.

173
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,781
And I've got her really close to me...

174
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,408
...and her eyes are all fiery.

175
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:50,036
And my eyes are fiery.

176
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,914
And it's like-- It's electric.

177
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:56,793
And I say to her, "Mom....

178
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:00,588
Mother...."

179
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:04,092
What?

180
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,348
Thanks for letting me finish.

181
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,852
What can I say?

182
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,937
You're a funny guy.

183
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:22,110
Oh, yeah. My friend Rusty.
I'm worried about him.

184
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,362
He owns this hotel in Los Angeles...

185
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,448
...losing a lot of money'
and he's got no life.

186
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:31,411
He's a nice, bright kid'
but he's beating his brains out.

187
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:36,207
Do you think I could send something
through you, like, a message to him?

188
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,668
I read your palm, not his.

189
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:41,796
Somebody who could do that could do
very well. Anything on my heaIth?

190
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,549
-My hips are bothering me.
-Please.

191
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,597
This? You couldn't see this?

192
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:57,103
-I tried knocking, he won't open.
-I'll handle it. I know him.

193
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,647
Jesus Christ, are you people retarded?

194
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:02,984
-It says, "Do not disturb"!
-It's me.

195
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,701
Hey.

196
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,662
Come on in.

197
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,166
Jeez, Topher, you didn't
have to go all Frankie Muniz on me.

198
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:21,628
I'm sorry.
Rust, look, I know this is your joint.

199
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,212
I just....

200
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,174
There's this girl.

201
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,218
I love her, man.

202
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:32,430
I love her, but she is driving me crazy!

203
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,682
I can't sleep. I can't work.

204
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:38,144
I quit the show. I totally phoned in
that Dennis Quaid movie.

205
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,939
-I mean, it's like....
-Hello?

206
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:44,859
God, it's almost like this
Kabbalah crap doesn't even work!

207
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,862
Rusty, call for you.

208
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,242
Dude, don't leave.

209
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,829
-Yeah?
-I have a message for Robert Charles Ryan...

210
00:15:56,997 --> 00:16:00,541
...soon to be ex-owner
of the Standard Hotel.

211
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:05,171
-You got him.
-Last time we spoke, you hung up on me.

212
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:08,091
You used some nasty words.
I got sensitive ears.

213
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:10,760
I admit I was a little
emotional that evening.

214
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,054
Think about that night a lot'
don't you?

215
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:16,432
I thought I'd be dead before
I heard the sound that killed me.

216
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,269
I've been asked to show restraint.
Otherwise, you would've gone out...

217
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:25,400
...to your favorite car of all the 17 you own,
and as soon as you turned on the ignition....

218
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,115
You got two weeks.

219
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:45,420
Now, you told me that your wife said
that he called it Ocean's 11.

220
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:48,464
Now, who decided that?
I'm a private contractor.

221
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:51,259
It was a collaboration.
That moniker is insuIting.

222
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,344
It was one job we did together.

223
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:57,515
I don't know where this proprietary stance
comes from. It seems possessive.

224
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,476
One could make the argument
that because it was Danny's idea--

225
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:03,688
Hang on a minute.
We all had our own areas of expertise.

226
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,524
I mean, without us,
it don't leave your head, mate.

227
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,609
It just hurts, you know, because...

228
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,946
...it seemed we all agreed
to call it "the Benedict job."

229
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,532
That's what we called it
when we were doing it.

230
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,868
lf you wanted to call it
something else--

231
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,245
When you have a problem,
who do you go to?

232
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,456
-Rusty.
-Rusty.

233
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,458
Thanks.
Let's get back on the topic.

234
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,753
Based on what we stole, plus interest...

235
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:31,215
-...how much does everybody owe?
-$1 7.34 million.

236
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:35,303
Assuming Benedict gives us
prime plus one, which I doubt.

237
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,472
Figure 19 to be safe.

238
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:41,476
Okay, 19 each. Anybody got that?

239
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,397
What, you think the stock market's
some great mystery...

240
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:50,693
...beyond the realm of human
understanding? Didn't you see the signs?

241
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:55,031
I saw the signs.

242
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,824
How much is everybody short?

243
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:58,242
How much you short?

244
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,370
Fourteen. Fourteen.

245
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:04,332
-All but 5 million?
-Yeah. You gonna start with me?

246
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,835
You don't know what it's like
to create something from scratch.

247
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:10,630
-Well, with interest, I'm short 7.
-Eight.

248
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,883
I spent about a million'
mostly on talent development.

249
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:17,345
That makes it 7 for me.
Boy, the interest just kills you.

250
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,680
-I'm light 9.
-What's the interest?

251
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:22,558
-About 6.
-Then I owe 6.

252
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:24,185
-How?
-What?

253
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,687
I've been staying at my parents'.

254
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,941
I owe 25.

255
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,695
Hotels, man.

256
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:36,864
Saul?

257
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:41,077
I haven't spent it all, but I will.

258
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,621
I'm out, fellas.

259
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:48,459
As ranking old-timer,
I gotta say, I just can't do it.

260
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:53,506
At my age, I think I earned
the right to be selfish.

261
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:58,386
I wanna thank you all for the wonderful
opportunity. You're all aces in my book.

262
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:03,432
But I want the last check
I write to bounce.

263
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,812
Saul, you having a laugh?

264
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,605
Saul.

265
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:17,405
-I can handle Saul's share.
-You don't have to.

266
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:20,074
Who would I talk to if you Were all dead?

267
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:23,828
That's a good point.
All right, I owe 10. Amazing?

268
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,501
Yeah, but it's a nice place.

269
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,839
-So that comes to...?
-Ninety-seven, give or take.

270
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,425
He didn't find us on his own.

271
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,011
-Someone helped him.
-Another thief.

272
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,763
Nobody we know would
violate rule number one.

273
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:46,142
What we do know is we need a job.
We need a high-paying job.

274
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,769
We're too hot to work
anywhere in this country.

275
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:52,440
-So we go abroad. How about we go--?
-We're on the 5:00.

276
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,109
Good. Where are We going?

277
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,653
-Amsterdam.
-Amsterdam it is.

278
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:00,865
-Clock's running. Let's go.
-Never been to Amsterdam.

279
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,492
I hear German girls are really hot.

280
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,411
Rusty.

281
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,955
-Amsterdam?
-Yeah.

282
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,791
Don't tell Danny.

283
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:20,468
Hey, Rusty. Rusty.

284
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,095
Sorry, sorry. Hey.

285
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:25,139
What are you doing?
What's wrong with you?

286
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,599
-Nothing.
-What?

287
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,643
-Can I--? Can I--?
-What?

288
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,604
-Just for a second, can I talk to you?
-What's wrong?

289
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,564
I just-- I don't know.

290
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:37,360
This might not be the perfect time
or whatever to talk about it.

291
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,654
-Okay.
-I've been thinking.

292
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,493
I've been doing my homework.

293
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,371
And I'd really like...

294
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:51,499
...to play a more central role
this time around.

295
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,542
-Right.
-I feel like I've--

296
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,670
-Right.
-I'm ready for that, and l--

297
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,046
Way overdue.

298
00:20:57,214 --> 00:21:01,259
I was wondering if I could come to
the meeting and help you guys negotiate.

299
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:06,430
Okay. It's just a sit-down with Matsui.

300
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:10,101
He's got his own language, this guy.

301
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:14,105
I watched you and Danny really closely
last time around. I learned a ton.

302
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:18,067
Linus, in my professional opinion,
you're not ready.

303
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:22,655
-Okay. Yeah, I mean--
-But-- But-- But...

304
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:25,825
...if you're convinced you are ready...

305
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,911
...I can speak with Danny.
We can make this happen.

306
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,622
But you gotta be sure.

307
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:37,878
-Not sure?
-No, I am.

308
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:40,881
-You're sure?
-But if I had a question, I could--

309
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,883
-You would call me?
-Right. Okay.

310
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:44,635
Any time.

311
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,304
-Okay.
-Okay.

312
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,472
-All right.
-Okay. Awesome. Thank you.

313
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,974
Yeah.

314
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:55,730
I almost wasn't gonna
come over and say anything.

315
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:58,274
Then I'd still be sleeping.

316
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,901
-Thanks, buddy.
-Yeah.

317
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:33,309
-Who's there?
-Li-- It's--

318
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,186
-What?
-It's Linus.

319
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,730
ls Rusty here? Rusty...?

320
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,358
-Do you know where Rusty is?
-No.

321
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,568
So have you met Matsui?

322
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:45,321
Seriously, what do you think of me...

323
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:48,240
...you know, in terms
of just leadership potential?

324
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,907
The fact that we're unemployable
shouldn't enter your mind.

325
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:14,869
Otherwise, you're wasting time.

326
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,371
Don't mention Benedict
unless he does first.

327
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,457
And if he does, tell him everything.

328
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:23,169
Right. Stay on point. And don't
forget the other thing I told you.

329
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:24,628
-What?
-About listening.

330
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:27,631
Relax. Remember, if we don't
get this job, We're dead.

331
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,009
Rusty, I tried calling you
all yesterday.

332
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:34,054
So finally, she slams her vodka tonic
down on the tray and says:

333
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:38,893
"Hey, maybe that's why
I've been feeling so warm recently."

334
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:54,992
Yeah.

335
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:59,788
-So to business?
-To business.

336
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:03,083
A doctor who specializes in skin diseases...

337
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:06,545
...will dream he has fallen asleep
in front of the television.

338
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:09,507
Later, he will wake up
in front of the television...

339
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:12,009
...but not remember his dream.

340
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,555
Would you agree?

341
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:30,778
lf all the animals along the equator
were capable of flattery...

342
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:34,323
...then Thanksgiving and Halloween...

343
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:37,409
...would fall on the same date.

344
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:40,788
Yeah. Hey.

345
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,670
When I was 4 years old...

346
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:52,174
...I watched my mother
kill a spider with a tea cozy.

347
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,888
Years later, I realized it was not a spider.

348
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:00,391
It was my Uncle Harold.

349
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:23,080
Oh, let the sun beat down upon my face

350
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,708
Stars to fill my dreams

351
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:30,504
I am a traveler in both time and space

352
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:33,382
To be where I have been

353
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,525
Is he all right? Are we all right?

354
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:54,653
-"Kashmir"?
-ls that your idea of making a contribution?

355
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:58,157
-We hadn't even started yet.
-We Were this close to losing that.

356
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:02,536
Okay, I don't even understand what
happened in there. What did I say?

357
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:05,205
-You called his niece a whore.
-A cheap one.

358
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:07,791
-She's 7.
-Confined to bed with a case of--

359
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,336
-No, don't tell him about it.
-I'm sorry.

360
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:14,006
Okay. So, what does this mean?

361
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:16,008
It means you stay here.

362
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:24,558
The mark's name is van der Woude.
A semi-known, weaIthy recluse.

363
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:27,728
He claims to sell antiques,
but hasn't actually sold one.

364
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:31,231
His store is his privately owned home,
which no one eVer enters.

365
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:34,193
But don't let Van der Woude's
eccentricity fool you.

366
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:37,571
The house is extremely well-protected.

367
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:58,050
-What are we after?
-It's a document.

368
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:00,344
It's a very old, very valuable document.

369
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,805
-Yeah, what is it?
-A stock certificate.

370
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:06,558
The first one ever issued
from the first corporation on the planet.

371
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:08,686
Dutch East lndia Trading Company.

372
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,188
-The only one of its kind.
-What's the take?

373
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,023
2.5 million euro.

374
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:15,192
Wait. Each?

375
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,028
-No.
-Who negotiated this?

376
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:21,907
-That's a lot of money to a lot of people.
-Are you out of your mind?

377
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:25,911
lf we do one job a Week at that rate,
we won't pay Benedict off until....

378
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,706
-September 2005.
-Jesus Christ, Danny.

379
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:31,125
I hear you, but it's what's available.

380
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:32,876
After we pull this job off...

381
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:36,630
...Matsui's gonna throw us another.
It's gonna pay 10 times this one.

382
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,591
-Which will buy an extension from Benedict.
-You hope.

383
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:44,138
I hope. Now, the good news is that
Matsui gave us the system's master code.

384
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:46,724
-So, what are We waiting for?
-Van der Woude.

385
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,892
-That's the bad news.
-He never leaves.

386
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,812
-He's agoraphobic.
-He's never been out of his house?

387
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,482
-Not in 10 years since he moved in.
-Does he believe in fresh air?

388
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,193
-He opens his window.
-What does that mean?

389
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:00,654
-Best time of arrival.
-Means he opens his window.

390
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:03,907
Every night at 1:30 he takes an Ambien'
puts on Beethoven's Third.

391
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:07,995
By the fourth movement, he's out
like a light. So we go in at 3 a.m.

392
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:11,248
Okay, can we tap into the system
from the phone lines?

393
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:16,211
It's a closed-loop system with two servers
locked in titanium cases next to his bed.

394
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:18,589
-So hacking in is out.
-Look at this.

395
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,592
Telephone-repair truck'
basket up to the second floor.

396
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,970
Telescoping rod through the window'
tap out the freak's code.

397
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:28,849
-Dumb idea. One lane, one-way streets.
-Dumb idea.

398
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:31,685
All right? Any stoppage will bring cops.

399
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:34,855
The outside is covered
by five surveillance cameras.

400
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,483
Monitored 24 hours a day
by a security company.

401
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,319
He's got five exterior cameras?

402
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:42,279
-This guy is a freak.
-Super freak.

403
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,031
What about through the roof?

404
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:47,910
-Two more cameras, pressure sensors--
-A laser net over the trap door--

405
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:49,536
-Smoke the freak out.
-Yeah.

406
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:51,955
-Smoke the freak out.
-Hey!

407
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,999
-What?
-Do we have to use that term?

408
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:56,710
-What term?
-"Freak."

409
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:02,466
The National lnstitute of Mental HeaIth
estimates 5.6 percent of aduIts...

410
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,177
-...develop "agraphoriaphobia."
-Agoraphobia.

411
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:08,388
Whatever. I'm just saying,
I mean, do we...?

412
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:11,767
We don't need to be an
organization that labels people.

413
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:14,061
Oh, now we're an organization?

414
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,063
You'd call Emily Dickinson a freak?

415
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:19,733
-Are you hosting a telethon?
-Who's Emily Dickinson?

416
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:24,696
Am I the only one who feels funny
about stealing from a...?

417
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:26,907
You know, a handicapped guy?

418
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:29,785
-Well, I don't care.
-Hell, yeah.

419
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:32,329
I feel funny about other things.

420
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:33,997
Cool.

421
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:35,624
But....

422
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,251
-Yeah?
-But....

423
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:38,627
-Right.
-What?

424
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:41,755
-Ahab with a piggyback. Livingston?
-I can get anything.

425
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,465
-It's done.
-Ahab with What?

426
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:45,801
-Boys.
-You're making that up. That's--

427
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:49,555
That whole "Ahab with a piggyback,"
that's not real?

428
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,974
-Let me in.
-How do you think it feels...

429
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:55,394
-...when someone bangs on the door?
-I gotta go to the toilet.

430
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:58,146
Otherwise, I'm gonna shit on your feet.
Come on.

431
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,183
Show me them specs.

432
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:44,234
I've been doing this since
I'm 12 years old. You're micromanaging.

433
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:48,405
You gotta find people you can delegate to.
Otherwise, you'll never have a life.

434
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:52,159
I don't want a life. I want the hotel
to run like a hotel should.

435
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:53,827
Reuben.

436
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,454
Yeah.

437
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:57,915
Great.

438
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:01,001
-Okay. Good.
-Maybe.

439
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:03,670
Fantastic.

440
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:09,968
Remember in Miller's Crossing
where Turturro begs for his life?

441
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:13,347
Sure. "Look into your heart."

442
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:15,390
I cry every time.

443
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,100
What?

444
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,353
We have no line of sight.

445
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:24,441
Our only possibility, the window.
We're three inches too high.

446
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,735
There's no clear shot, even with Basher.

447
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:30,822
ln the physical universe we occupy'
it cannot be done.

448
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,367
What about the guy
from the Bulgari job?

449
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:35,869
-Nagel. Spoke with him.
-Anything?

450
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:38,747
Lot of ideas, none of them any good.

451
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:41,249
He's pushing this new
holographic technology.

452
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:45,671
Really interesting stuff, though.
He can reproduce anything 3-D.

453
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:48,215
How about 97 million?

454
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,468
We're forcing it.

455
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,929
Yeah, we're forcing it.

456
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:57,265
-You know what we haven't thought of?
-What?

457
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:59,101
We turn ourselves in.

458
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:02,020
-What could Benedict do to us then?
-There you go.

459
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:05,357
Call the cops,
tell them We did the Bellagio job.

460
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:08,485
They put us aWay for 20 years.
That'd teach him.

461
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:10,654
I think Tess would stick around.

462
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,906
You look great in jumpsuits.

463
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,158
Hey...

464
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:17,577
-...how's the hotel business?
-Sucks.

465
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:20,706
-How's East Haven?
-Sucks.

466
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,001
I don't know.

467
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:28,755
Can't turn my brain off, you know.
It's me.

468
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:33,176
We go into some place,
and all I can do is see the angles.

469
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:37,764
It's what I do. It's what
I've always done. I love it.

470
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:40,058
I don't know.

471
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,686
Some sort of weird irony, you know?

472
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:45,439
Tess watching me scratch and itch.

473
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:48,942
Hey, listen. You know'
the world's gone nuts and you're....

474
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,948
-What'd you wanna do?
-It's not attached to the adjacent buildings.

475
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:57,868
-The whole house?
-We're just raising it slightly.

476
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,954
Schumann did it in '64 in Venice
and '73 in lstanbul.

477
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:03,623
-He only had a crew of six.
-We can't tiIt a house.

478
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:07,294
-Did it with the Leaning Tower of Pizza.
-Exactly, thank you.

479
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:10,839
-It took 300 men over two years to do it.
-There's 30 pylons.

480
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:13,633
We cut them, insert the jacks
and crank away.

481
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:16,970
It's really our best plan,
considering it's our only plan.

482
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:21,475
-Crank for how long?
-Like I said, it's our only plan.

483
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,176
What?

484
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,765
Oh, oh, okay, hold on.

485
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,650
Try that.

486
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,705
Number five. I'm a go.

487
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:33,106
Master thieves who practice the long con
live separate lives as civilians.

488
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:35,609
They have legitimate jobs and families...

489
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:38,904
...which make them
extremely difficuIt to catch.

490
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:43,533
The greatest thief of all time was,
without question...

491
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:49,414
...Gaspar LeMarc, who either died
in Portugal in 1988...

492
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:55,503
...or in Hong Kong in 1996,
or he's still alive.

493
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:58,798
We may never know for certain,
because LeMarc...

494
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:01,968
...was never captured or photographed...

495
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:06,014
...despite being active for over 50 years.

496
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:09,976
Though he left behind a slew
of imitators...

497
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:14,981
...only one is worth mentioning
in the same breath as LeMarc:

498
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:19,027
The thief we know only
as the Night Fox.

499
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:23,657
So named for the small onyx figurines
he leaves behind to taunt us...

500
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:28,578
...the Night Fox must be considered
our number-one priority.

501
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:33,959
His string of high-profile crimes are
an embarrassment to our branch...

502
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:36,670
...to our entire profession.

503
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:42,717
We need more than traditional resources
to pursue thieves like the Night Fox.

504
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:49,182
We need to train ourselves to think the
way they think, to see what they see.

505
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:52,185
And we should not allow ourselves
to be distracted--

506
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:55,522
I'm sorry. Someone just robbed
the van der Woude house.

507
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,232
What?

508
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:13,832
Hi, lsabel. Well, we could really use
your help on this one.

509
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,918
I hope the scene hasn't
been contaminated.

510
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:33,059
When can I speak to Mr. van der Woude?

511
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:36,396
Probably tomorrow. He's heavily sedated.

512
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:40,233
We can't figure out how they disabled
the alarm. Shorted it out somehow?

513
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:44,571
No, that would have triggered the system
and damaged the circuits.

514
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:48,575
Well, then.
Then I don't know how they got in.

515
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:57,334
They had the code. Someone other than
the owner must have known it.

516
00:38:57,501 --> 00:39:01,004
lmpossible. Van der Woude programmed
the last nine steps of the system.

517
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:04,007
He set it and never left the house again.

518
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:08,219
Closed loop. Redundant servers.
Titanium encasement.

519
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:09,846
It's not bad, actually.

520
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:45,298
Yeah. Thanks.

521
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:02,482
Do we know each other?

522
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:07,904
-I think I saw you yesterday.
-Oh, yeah?

523
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:10,615
Yeah, you were being chased
by the police.

524
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:14,661
Chasing me? No. I don't think so.

525
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:17,831
I'm quite sure it was you.

526
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:20,125
Doesn't say much for the police.

527
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:27,132
No, I love Rome. I love it.

528
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:31,010
But there's an opening at work
the level above me, and it's--

529
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:34,514
I was thinking I was gonna try out for it.
It's in Amsterdam.

530
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:39,102
My mother has family there, so it'd be--
It'd be good.

531
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:47,986
-He lifted the whole house?
-The whole house.

532
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:50,155
-The entire house?
-The entire house.

533
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:52,490
It's called a Schumann Special...

534
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:56,786
...named affer this guy, a brilliant guy,
Max Schumann.

535
00:40:57,204 --> 00:41:01,833
Then he did it in lstanbul in 1973.

536
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:04,169
What is it?

537
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:09,174
It's where the crossbow boIt hit.

538
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,221
The crossbow boIt?

539
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:19,893
They fired from that rooftop
through this open window.

540
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:23,229
With a crossbow boIt from that roof
through that window?

541
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:27,192
-That's a very difficuIt shot.
-No, it is an impossible shot...

542
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,402
...until they raised the building.

543
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,863
Check the pylons. They'll be elevated.

544
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:35,450
-You know the name Max Schumann?
-No.

545
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,911
-Well, they do.
-Who?

546
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:39,704
The Americans.

547
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:19,577
Wait a minute.

548
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:30,088
Exactly why would they bring the drill
if they Weren't planning to use it?

549
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:34,384
-What?
-Oh, God.

550
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:51,067
-What?
-I don't know.

551
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:09,377
Congratulations. You are the second person
to crack the van der Woude safe tonight.

552
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:13,006
ln arriving second, Mr. Ocean,
you have joined a long line...

553
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:19,345
...of people who've worked hard and risked
a great deal only to get somewhere second.

554
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:24,976
You don't know these people by name,
of course, because they enter oblivion.

555
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:26,936
You know this word, "oblivion"?

556
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:31,232
It means to be totally forgotten
by everyone forever.

557
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:35,403
And it's where you would be now
if it weren't for the Bellagio heist.

558
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:37,572
How does this guy know who we are?

559
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:42,160
ln a way, I'm responsible for you
coming to Amsterdam in the first place.

560
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:45,371
I hired Matsui, and Matsui hired you.

561
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,790
That's the guy who dimed us
to Benedict.

562
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:51,252
-All of them, including Ocean.
-Yes.

563
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:56,633
I find that hard to believe.
And you are?

564
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,801
You can call me the Night Fox.

565
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:02,388
The Night Fox. Okay, Mr. Night Fox.

566
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:05,642
-What will this information cost me?
-Don't worry. Nothing.

567
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:09,729
Nothing? Who do you think you're
dealing with? Nothing costs nothing.

568
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:12,565
And this information is definitely
worth something.

569
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:16,569
Let's just say our interests
are temporarily aligned.

570
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:18,488
How so?

571
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:22,241
Well, the information is free,
but it comes with certain conditions.

572
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:25,578
-Such as?
-Restraint on your part.

573
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:29,582
Restraint? That's asking a lot.
What else?

574
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,251
Two weeks to buy themselves
out of trouble.

575
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:34,045
Two weeks?

576
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:37,924
I can live with that, even if they can't.

577
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:42,428
Just out of curiosity,
what will you make them pay?

578
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:47,600
For letting them live?
Everything they stole, plus interest.

579
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:50,103
A lot of interest.

580
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:53,314
But didn't your insurance
coVer what was stolen?

581
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:55,108
Of course.

582
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:57,944
So you're asking them to double
your money?

583
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:00,113
Well, do you really think that's fair?

584
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:04,701
Fair? I certainly hope not.
So, what about the information?

585
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:08,079
Okay. It's on your desk.

586
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:15,086
He was here.
Around 3:30 this morning. I can tell.

587
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:17,255
-Who?
-The Night Fox.

588
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:23,094
Go down to the Dampkring
and pick up a guy called Matsui.

589
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:25,304
Real name, lan Nicolas McNally.

590
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:30,143
The Night Fox was here at the same time
as the Americans? Why?

591
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:33,312
That's what we're gonna find out.

592
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:39,777
What is he doing?

593
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:42,989
Get him out of there.

594
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:46,534
God.

595
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,346
Hello, Frank.

596
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:50,890
I can't understand what We did
to this guy.

597
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:54,727
-Why does he have it out for us like this?
-How did he get that code?

598
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:58,231
Doesn't matter. He broke rule
number one. He's on the list.

599
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:00,024
Great time for a turf war.

600
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:04,737
I spoke with Frank's associate in Dublin.
She's trying to get us a name on this guy.

601
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:07,657
Our train leaves tomorrow at 1:38, okay?

602
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,909
-Where is Frank?
-I don't know.

603
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:15,414
It's gonna get out. Then we'll be dead,
and no one will wanna work with us.

604
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:18,084
Housekeeping.

605
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:31,848
Turndown service for Mr. Ryan.

606
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:42,900
Hi.

607
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:50,116
Nice room.

608
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:52,869
You have it all to yourself?

609
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:57,456
You here to take me in?

610
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,920
Why would I do that?
It's not as if you stole something.

611
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:07,466
It's nice to see you again, Robert.

612
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:09,385
You too.

613
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:14,599
Of course, you've been seeing
plenty of me, haven't you?

614
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:19,103
I like this one.

615
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:22,273
I call it "thief à la mode."

616
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:32,074
Schumann Special, huh?

617
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:36,162
I guess that's what I get
for opening my mouth.

618
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:39,206
So, what about the Night Fox?

619
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:41,626
Did he leave you a message?

620
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:45,171
What about the figurine?
You still have it?

621
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:52,094
I suppose it's a compliment in a way.

622
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:57,600
I guess he's threatened by you,
though I can't imagine why.

623
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:02,313
You have no idea what you're up against.

624
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:05,066
The French police
think he's better than LeMarc.

625
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:07,318
Well, he is French.

626
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:10,029
Let me give you some advice.

627
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:15,201
Find out how you offended him.
Apologize. Beg for mercy.

628
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,997
Got to go.

629
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:25,920
Any message for Frank?
He's been hanging around the station.

630
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:27,880
On what charge?

631
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:33,260
Well, we found a print of a size 14
Hi-Tec Magnum boot at the crime scene.

632
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:35,221
And?

633
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:37,723
Bought with a fraudulent credit card.

634
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:43,854
From that point on, well, there's only one,
maybe two great nail salons in Amsterdam.

635
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:03,791
-And you lied to us.
-Yeah, and to me.

636
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:07,628
Well, Frank knew.

637
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:10,923
-Frank knew you were in touch?
-I wasn't in touch.

638
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:13,134
I was more like keeping tabs.

639
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:16,262
-She's a cop!
-Detective, actually.

640
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:19,098
-Where'd she learn all that Schumann crap?
-Dad.

641
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:20,808
-What, he was a cop?
-Thief.

642
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:23,102
-Oh, God. Was he good?
-Oh, yeah.

643
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:27,189
Great. Pissed-off ex-girlfriend
whose thief father...

644
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:29,483
...taught her every trick in the book.

645
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:31,527
Well, she just made Danny and Yen.

646
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:35,656
ln the next 48 hours, your pictures
will be in every police station.

647
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:38,617
-Nobody looks at them.
-Nobody but cops.

648
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:41,495
-Detectives.
-You'd think she'd have sympathy for us...

649
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:45,458
-...if her old man was a thief.
-ls that sympathy or empathy?

650
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:49,587
No, her old man got popped a day
before her 9th birthday. Died in jail.

651
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:53,340
So I wouldn't count on much sympathy.
Or empathy.

652
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:56,010
She's gonna have the hotel
under surveillance.

653
00:50:56,595 --> 00:51:00,890
Great. We'll just eat room service, watch
movies and wait for Benedict to kill us.

654
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:02,808
-Who's on the $100 bill?
-Adams.

655
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:05,102
-John TravoIta.
-He said every problem...

656
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:07,104
...is an opportunity in disguise.

657
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:09,607
He couldn't say that
with a.45 in his mouth.

658
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:11,984
No, you're missing the silver lining here.

659
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:16,030
Now, she gave us a name, didn't she?
The Night Fox.

660
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:20,576
One phone call, We're gonna find out
everything there is to know about this guy.

661
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:53,085
The name is M. Diaz.
D-l-A-Z.

662
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,422
It's a black duffel bag.

663
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:00,926
The team's in Rotterdam.
The bag's in Brussels.

664
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:05,598
He's the modern man:
disconnected, frightened...

665
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:08,434
...paranoid, but with good reason.

666
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:12,104
It's too sad to be funny.
Unusable.

667
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:15,107
-I think I can get 20 minutes out of it.
-Great.

668
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:18,819
I got it. The team's in Barcelona.
The bag's in Madrid.

669
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:22,907
This is a moral issue
we're dealing with here.

670
00:53:23,074 --> 00:53:26,827
And we don't have a grease man anymore,
because he's in a bag somewhere.

671
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:28,495
We got a bag man.

672
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:31,123
Such an ape. An animal with no feelings.

673
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:33,209
-I have feelings.
-No, you don't.

674
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:37,254
I feel bad for the guy. He's in a piece
of luggage, but he's got water.

675
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:40,132
-What did you want them to do?
-Get off the bus.

676
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,635
And pick up the bag
with our friend in it.

677
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:45,804
How many pro soccer teams
are fielding 50-year-old men?

678
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:47,973
Rusty's not 50 years old.

679
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:52,311
Yeah, dude, we know Rusty's not 50.

680
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:56,148
You think I'm 50 years old?
Let me ask you something.

681
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:58,234
No, wait, let me ask you something.

682
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:00,569
How old do you think I am?

683
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:02,529
Forty-eight.

684
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:06,575
You think I'm 48 years old?

685
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:09,787
Fifty-two?

686
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:18,170
-Maybe he should've asked me.
-Nobody should ever ask you anything.

687
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:22,341
That guy doesn't have a hard enough
life right now? You gotta--

688
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:25,511
You're gonna defend him?
They put Yen in a handbag.

689
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:30,432
-Can I ask you something? Ever notice--?
-lf you're gonna ask a question...

690
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,269
...give me time to respond,
unless it's rhetorical...

691
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:35,729
...in which case the answer
is obvious: yes.

692
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:37,314
-Okay, can I ask--?
-Yes.

693
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:41,527
-You ever notice that Tess looks exactly--?
-Don't ever ask that. Seriously.

694
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:45,030
-Not to anyone. Especially not to her.
-Wait. Why not?

695
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:47,032
Look.

696
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,702
It's not in my nature to be mysterious...

697
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:53,622
...but I can't talk about it,
and I can't talk about why.

698
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:03,299
-Can I ask you--? Do I look 50 to you?
-Yeah.

699
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:09,346
-Really?
-Well, I mean, only from the neck up.

700
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:08,072
Saul? What's the matter?

701
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:12,076
Nothing.

702
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:16,705
You wanna go out? It's nice.

703
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:19,291
No.

704
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:22,419
You wanna watch something?
The game's on.

705
00:56:22,587 --> 00:56:24,838
No.

706
00:56:25,006 --> 00:56:29,134
-You hungry? I'll heat something up.
-No.

707
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:35,057
Saul, ever since you got back,
you've been acting strange.

708
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:38,477
What did Danny want?

709
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:40,646
Nothing.

710
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:43,899
Nothing? How could he want nothing?

711
00:56:57,455 --> 00:57:00,999
All right, the Night Fox has a name.
François Toulour.

712
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:03,335
Baron François Toulour.

713
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:06,797
Father was a French industrialist,
mother was Italian nobility.

714
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:09,675
He never met her,
but he inherited her title.

715
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:13,720
The bad news is he's rich, he's bored
and he's talented.

716
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:17,433
The really bad news is he was trained
by LeMarc.

717
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:21,145
-This is not good.
-With the LeMarc? Gaspar LeMarc?

718
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:23,021
That's the one.

719
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:25,274
-Well, we're doomed.
-We're not doomed.

720
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:27,526
-He's one guy, and he's French.
-Yeah.

721
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:30,195
Before we get too impressed
by his background...

722
00:57:30,363 --> 00:57:33,282
-...let's hear what he's done.
-He started in the '90s.

723
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:37,202
Bank of Geneva, the Danish Treasury,
the Bank of Italy, AMC Amro...

724
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:40,414
...the Brussels Diamond Exchange,
Antwerp Diamond Exchange.

725
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:44,042
-Wait, wait. All those in the 1990s?
-I'm only up to '96.

726
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:46,837
-Seriously?
-ln '97, he went through an art phase.

727
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:51,049
He hit the Tate in London, the Louvre
in Paris, twice, and the Prado.

728
00:57:51,217 --> 00:57:54,678
Wait. No, no, hang on. The Prado Museum
in '97? That was Moretti.

729
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:58,265
-Everybody knows that--
-He is Moretti. It's one of his aliases.

730
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:02,227
Okay, I'll skip to my favorite.

731
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:08,567
ln 2002, he stole the king of Morocco's
200-foot yacht. Vanished into thin air.

732
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:12,237
Crew surfaced days later in a life raft.
Couldn't remember a thing.

733
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:16,200
-How do you hide a 200-foot yacht?
-lf the king knows, he's not telling.

734
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:20,412
He got it back a month later. He now plays
tennis with Toulour every weekend.

735
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:23,874
-We're in some serious trouble here.
-Copy that.

736
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:26,502
-So, what do we do?
-We respond.

737
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:30,923
-Respond? How?
-ln kind.

738
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:55,781
Mr. Ocean.

739
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:59,451
You broke rule number one'
and that has consequences.

740
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:02,287
Oh, you must be talking about
the paintings.

741
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:06,917
Don't worry. You'll be dead in five days,
and I'll get my paintings back.

742
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:10,796
-Unless you have an accident first.
-I don't think so, Daniel.

743
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:14,299
Perhaps I should explain to you
why I'm tormenting you.

744
00:59:14,467 --> 00:59:16,635
I'd like that.

745
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:19,680
Last month I was in Portugal
to see my mentor.

746
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:21,473
-LeMarc.
-lndeed.

747
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:27,437
A very loud and annoying American
businessman was there the same day.

748
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:31,024
He worked for a big insurance company.

749
00:59:31,192 --> 00:59:34,778
He's the one who suggested Benedict
to you as a potential mark.

750
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:37,239
-You know the man?
-What about him?

751
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:40,576
He said it was the most
beautiful job he'd ever seen.

752
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:44,162
He went on and on about this job,
and then he said...

753
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:47,207
...it showed you were the greatest
thief in the world.

754
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:51,378
But the worst part is that LeMarc
never corrected him.

755
00:59:55,592 --> 01:00:00,178
I told LeMarc that you can't be
better than me.

756
01:00:00,346 --> 01:00:04,433
And he answered that it was impossible
to know for sure.

757
01:00:04,642 --> 01:00:10,522
So I thought about that for, like,
three weeks in a row, day and night.

758
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:15,861
And then suddenly, I realized that
he was actually right.

759
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:19,531
It is impossible to compare one theft
to the other.

760
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:26,330
So I guess the only way to know
who's the best of us for sure...

761
01:00:26,497 --> 01:00:29,791
...is to go after the same object.
Do the same job.

762
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:33,128
Don't you think that would be fun?

763
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:38,759
You're being awfully cavalier with a lot of
people's lives so you can play out a game.

764
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:42,387
You're gonna regret it.

765
01:00:43,097 --> 01:00:45,849
Come on, Mr. Ocean.

766
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:50,228
How are you gonna possibly get
$97 million by next Wednesday?

767
01:00:50,396 --> 01:00:55,359
Especially if every safe you crack
between now and then is already empty?

768
01:00:55,526 --> 01:00:57,819
Whereas if you accept my challenge
and win...

769
01:00:57,987 --> 01:01:00,614
...I promise I'll pay your debt
to Benedict...

770
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:04,576
...and LeMarc will hold my money
in escrow as a guarantee.

771
01:01:11,709 --> 01:01:13,752
What are we stealing?

772
01:01:15,713 --> 01:01:17,923
The famous Fabergé Coronation Egg.

773
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:21,343
-Was that your idea or LeMarc's?
-I think he would agree...

774
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:24,763
...that it's the most appropriate thing
for us to compete over.

775
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:26,765
Where is it located?

776
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:30,185
The egg leff Paris this morning
on its way to Rome.

777
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:34,898
It travels with heavy security and usually
with one or more replicas.

778
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:39,319
Sometimes they even show the replicas
without anybody knowing.

779
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:42,364
When the egg goes on display
Monday morning...

780
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:46,618
...you'll have 48 hours to steal it
before your deadline's up.

781
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:49,996
When the deadline passes
and you don't have the egg...

782
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:53,375
...LeMarc will know who's the best.

783
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:12,644
-Rusty's phone.
-Who is this?

784
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:15,063
Nicole. Who's this?

785
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:18,066
Nagel. Where's Rusty?

786
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:22,028
He said if you called,
to say he was at Gunther's.

787
01:02:22,196 --> 01:02:25,323
Gunther's? What's that about?
Did he say something?

788
01:02:25,491 --> 01:02:26,992
Do you have a message?

789
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:30,912
Yes, I do. Tell him this thing is gonna
cost him double what I told him.

790
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:34,750
And tell him I had to go three times
as thin on the layers.

791
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:39,880
And tell him if he wants it tomorrow,
it should cost him more than double.

792
01:02:40,965 --> 01:02:43,300
And tell him this thing is beautiful.

793
01:02:43,551 --> 01:02:46,470
Would fool the bloody Romanovs
themselves.

794
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:51,683
And tell him I'm being a nice guy.
And tell him he dresses like a gigolo.

795
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:53,685
ls that it?

796
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:58,732
Yeah. No. Tell him having
a sexy female assistant...

797
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:02,527
...is such a terrible cliché.

798
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:15,707
Can I get a coffee or something?

799
01:03:16,542 --> 01:03:19,920
Thanks. Just a cappuccino or espresso.

800
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:24,216
Well....

801
01:03:33,434 --> 01:03:36,520
You call me on Saturday
and ask me to come into my office...

802
01:03:36,687 --> 01:03:38,730
...and sign a 1077...

803
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:41,942
...and you can't even tell me
what they are affer?

804
01:03:42,109 --> 01:03:45,362
-I can come to your house.
-I'm leaving for Naples in two hours.

805
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:48,907
-We'll talk about this on Wednesday.
-It'll be gone by Wednesday.

806
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:52,994
-What? What? What will be gone?
-Something worth signing a 1077 for.

807
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:56,915
Ryan and his friends
did the Bellagio casino heist in 2001.

808
01:03:57,083 --> 01:04:00,085
-I am telling you, this is serious--
-lf that's true...

809
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:03,713
-...then we should call the American FBl--
-No, no, no.

810
01:04:03,881 --> 01:04:06,675
-Maurizio, listen to me.
-Agent Lahiri...

811
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:10,262
...a 1077 is not a small thing.

812
01:04:10,429 --> 01:04:15,433
Unless you can tell me what they are affer,
there is no point in discussing it.

813
01:05:00,813 --> 01:05:02,022
Hey--

814
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:08,862
Because LeMarc stole it in 1980
when 23 others failed.

815
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:13,533
Because the Night Fox is trying to prove
he's better than Ryan and his friends.

816
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:19,331
This is ridiculous.
You say the egg will be stolen.

817
01:05:19,498 --> 01:05:23,752
Then you say LeMarc already stole it
24 years ago.

818
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:27,172
-Which one is it?
-Both.

819
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:29,174
What?

820
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:32,385
LeMarc's wife made him
put the egg back.

821
01:05:36,849 --> 01:05:41,353
When I signed a 1077 for you
on the Bulgari case...

822
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:47,692
...you requisitioned 30 of my men
for three months and made zero arrests.

823
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:53,323
I won't do it again.

824
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:58,370
First, we cannot go at night.

825
01:05:58,537 --> 01:06:01,331
The laser grid in the Great Hall's
impossible to beat.

826
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:04,167
-Nothing's impossible.
-This is impossible.

827
01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:07,379
It's in constant motion, programmed
to improvise randomly...

828
01:06:07,546 --> 01:06:09,714
...meaning we can't
plan our way through.

829
01:06:09,882 --> 01:06:11,132
All right.

830
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:12,634
So it's a daytime play.

831
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:17,889
We're still short three on the inside
since lsabel made you and Yen and Danny.

832
01:06:18,057 --> 01:06:20,350
We could try a Smuggler's Paradise.

833
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:23,395
-It hasn't worked since the '50s.
-'54, actually.

834
01:06:23,562 --> 01:06:25,105
What's option two?

835
01:06:25,272 --> 01:06:28,316
Baby Jane, Squeaky Wheel,
followed by a Number-Two Son.

836
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:32,320
It's complicated, but it's got a high
success rate. The only problem is--

837
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:36,074
We can't do it without a grease man
on the inside, without Yen.

838
01:06:37,785 --> 01:06:41,287
We'll have to risk it.
We'll put him in disguise.

839
01:06:42,873 --> 01:06:45,500
10:10, I leave the café,
proceed west. 10:11 ?

840
01:06:47,795 --> 01:06:50,380
-I enter the second-floor bathroom.
-10:13?

841
01:06:50,548 --> 01:06:52,716
Approach the Spanish Steps
from the south.

842
01:06:52,883 --> 01:06:55,051
Basher and I enter by the main entrance.

843
01:06:55,219 --> 01:06:58,013
-10:15?
-I help Yen into the ventilation duct.

844
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:00,557
-10:18?
-I move Reuben to the Egg Room.

845
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:03,601
-I pause in the Great Hall while--
-I go to the Egg Room.

846
01:07:03,769 --> 01:07:05,770
-10:21 ?
-Yen enters the mainframe room.

847
01:07:05,938 --> 01:07:09,399
He cuts power to grid 14-A.
He radios me. I signal Linus.

848
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:11,359
-I then go to the Egg Room.
-I 0:22?

849
01:07:11,527 --> 01:07:13,778
I drop my keys and move Reuben
to his mark.

850
01:07:13,946 --> 01:07:16,906
-I blind camera one.
-I blind camera two.

851
01:07:17,074 --> 01:07:19,117
-I blind camera three.
-Camera four.

852
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:20,618
-I make the switch.
-Right.

853
01:07:20,786 --> 01:07:24,289
-10:24?
-I pull to the corner of the main entrance.

854
01:07:24,457 --> 01:07:27,125
I meet Danny at the Steps.
We head north. 10:25?

855
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:28,668
Turk and I make the drop.

856
01:07:28,836 --> 01:07:31,004
All right. Really good stuff, guys.

857
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:35,175
Really good work. All right,
we'll pick it up here in an hour.

858
01:07:35,342 --> 01:07:37,302
It's a slam-dunk.

859
01:07:37,845 --> 01:07:40,388
-Great.
-10:45, we all get arrested.

860
01:07:40,556 --> 01:07:41,973
You bet.

861
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:44,517
-How was Toulour?
-He was predictable.

862
01:07:44,685 --> 01:07:46,895
You hear from Nagel?

863
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:48,480
He'll be here.

864
01:07:48,647 --> 01:07:51,024
That's a lot to presume
from a guy like Nagel.

865
01:07:51,192 --> 01:07:52,817
Follow it up.

866
01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:01,326
This is lsabel.

867
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:05,080
It's Johan. I just set a 6:00 meeting
for you with an Andre Ciment...

868
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:09,959
...who says he had four paintings stolen
from his house in Lake Como.

869
01:08:10,127 --> 01:08:12,128
-And when was this?
-Sometime Friday.

870
01:08:12,296 --> 01:08:14,839
He's missing two Monets,
a Turner and a Degas.

871
01:08:15,007 --> 01:08:17,342
-Which Degas was it?
-Blue Dancers.

872
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:22,180
Supposedly, there's surveillance video,
but I haven't been able to confirm that yet.

873
01:08:22,348 --> 01:08:24,724
It is all about error correction.

874
01:08:25,893 --> 01:08:29,687
Three thousand separate'
translucent, digital slivers...

875
01:08:29,855 --> 01:08:32,982
...instead of the 1000
I thought it would be.

876
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:35,485
Thank God it doesn't have to move.

877
01:08:38,364 --> 01:08:42,659
Re-creating the lighting was a pain.
It's a mixture of tungsten and real light.

878
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:45,870
But I think the color rendition
is pretty damn accurate.

879
01:08:46,038 --> 01:08:50,083
Batteries are in the base.
Two minutes maximum.

880
01:08:50,251 --> 01:08:51,876
You're good.

881
01:08:52,044 --> 01:08:55,046
-It's good, Roman. You're a genius.
-I think I am.

882
01:08:56,215 --> 01:08:59,008
You'd have never got past that grid.

883
01:08:59,176 --> 01:09:01,052
That's why you're paying me double.

884
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:03,346
-What? No, no, no.
-You got my message.

885
01:09:03,514 --> 01:09:07,016
-Who's that sexy phone voice? Early Bond.
-What message?

886
01:09:07,184 --> 01:09:10,186
The message I left with
Sexy Phone Voice Nicole.

887
01:09:10,354 --> 01:09:11,980
On your mobile.

888
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:15,275
Got something going
with Gunther? Am I in?

889
01:09:15,442 --> 01:09:19,696
-Okay, when did you leave the message?
-Two days ago.

890
01:09:19,905 --> 01:09:21,990
She had your phone.

891
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:25,410
-She has your--?
-Yeah.

892
01:09:27,955 --> 01:09:29,831
-That means that she's--?
-Yeah.

893
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,876
-Well, you better--
-Yeah.

894
01:09:34,879 --> 01:09:36,379
-That's great.
-I mean....

895
01:09:36,547 --> 01:09:40,884
So--? So who's got my money?

896
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:47,056
Who has got my bloody money?

897
01:10:07,661 --> 01:10:09,329
Jesus.

898
01:10:21,133 --> 01:10:23,384
Sorry to hear about your mom.

899
01:10:24,345 --> 01:10:26,471
She was an amazing....

900
01:10:27,431 --> 01:10:28,973
Well, I thought so, at least.

901
01:10:29,308 --> 01:10:32,810
She hated you.
I should've picked up on that.

902
01:10:32,978 --> 01:10:35,396
-She hated all thieves.
-No wonder you fought.

903
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:36,814
Excuse me?

904
01:10:36,982 --> 01:10:39,317
-May I have my phone back?
-No.

905
01:10:41,862 --> 01:10:44,906
-That's a nice pull, by the way.
-Thanks.

906
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:48,785
Did you get that tingling sensation
down your spine when you did it?

907
01:10:48,953 --> 01:10:51,204
Or is that none of my business?

908
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:56,167
You considered a career change?

909
01:10:56,335 --> 01:10:57,835
Have you?

910
01:11:00,839 --> 01:11:02,173
I tried hotels.

911
01:11:02,341 --> 01:11:03,758
I'm better at this.

912
01:11:08,555 --> 01:11:10,431
Went by the café for some tiramisu.

913
01:11:10,599 --> 01:11:12,767
-It wasn't the same.
-Who's the Night Fox?

914
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:16,688
-They did something to the eggs.
-Why accept his challenge?

915
01:11:17,773 --> 01:11:19,357
Because he'll lose.

916
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:21,067
And how can you beat him?

917
01:11:21,235 --> 01:11:22,610
We can't.

918
01:11:24,029 --> 01:11:25,863
You're not making any sense.

919
01:11:26,031 --> 01:11:27,573
Okay.

920
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:36,207
The Bulgari job you pulled with Frank
when we were together...

921
01:11:37,626 --> 01:11:38,876
...I knew it was you.

922
01:11:42,339 --> 01:11:44,382
Why didn't you say something?

923
01:11:47,636 --> 01:11:49,429
Why didn't you...

924
01:11:49,930 --> 01:11:51,431
...Robert?

925
01:11:52,766 --> 01:11:54,726
I didn't want it to end.

926
01:11:58,063 --> 01:11:59,439
You assumed it would.

927
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:02,191
Was I wrong?

928
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,237
You shouldn't be here.

929
01:12:09,408 --> 01:12:10,992
I have a meeting.

930
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:14,412
Someone stole a whole bunch
of paintings in Lake Como.

931
01:12:15,831 --> 01:12:18,791
lnteresting. Any leads?

932
01:12:18,959 --> 01:12:20,335
The next time I see you...

933
01:12:21,253 --> 01:12:23,087
...I'm arresting you.

934
01:12:23,255 --> 01:12:27,508
And Ocean and anybody else I recognize.

935
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:30,136
Fair enough.

936
01:13:27,361 --> 01:13:29,695
-Ready?
-Right.

937
01:13:47,005 --> 01:13:48,548
Yes, of course I do.

938
01:13:48,715 --> 01:13:50,967
My Blue Dancers, my Degas.

939
01:13:51,135 --> 01:13:53,928
They took it, unfortunately'
and I really would like--

940
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:55,972
Do you have any enemies?

941
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:59,225
Anybody out there who would
feel Wronged by you?

942
01:14:03,063 --> 01:14:05,273
No. I can't see anyone.

943
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:08,025
But why? You think--
You think maybe the thief...

944
01:14:08,193 --> 01:14:10,236
...is trying to harm me personally now?

945
01:14:10,404 --> 01:14:13,197
Well, I assumed he was after
the paintings themselves.

946
01:14:13,365 --> 01:14:14,615
I think it's enough.

947
01:14:14,783 --> 01:14:15,992
Ready?

948
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:25,918
Good?

949
01:14:28,172 --> 01:14:30,715
I have something you might be
interested in.

950
01:14:30,883 --> 01:14:36,220
It's a DVD with all the hidden
surveillance cameras I have to my place.

951
01:14:36,388 --> 01:14:39,140
It's plenty. I haven't checked it out yet.

952
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:42,602
Maybe the thieves have been
careless enough to be photographed.

953
01:14:42,769 --> 01:14:45,897
I doubt it, this level of thief,
but I'll take a look.

954
01:14:46,064 --> 01:14:47,315
Yeah. You never know.

955
01:14:47,566 --> 01:14:49,400
Okay. Well, merci.

956
01:14:51,195 --> 01:14:53,905
Thank you, Mademoiselle Lahiri'
for everything.

957
01:14:54,072 --> 01:14:56,574
Thank you. Goodbye. Goodbye.

958
01:14:57,743 --> 01:14:59,410
Mademoiselle Lahiri.

959
01:14:59,703 --> 01:15:03,331
Did you get the faxed copy
of the 1077? Good.

960
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:08,252
Here's what I need:
A dozen-- Twelve uniformed officers.

961
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:12,340
Metal detectors, extra cameras.

962
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:16,260
So I'll e-mail you the photographs.
Do you happen to have a pen?

963
01:15:16,428 --> 01:15:19,096
I'll just give you the names. Okay.

964
01:15:19,264 --> 01:15:23,809
Livingston Dell, male, Caucasian,
5'6", 150 pounds.

965
01:15:23,977 --> 01:15:28,606
Virgil Malloy, male, Caucasian,
5'1 0", 160 pounds.

966
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:31,400
Robert Ryan, male, Caucasian....

967
01:15:38,283 --> 01:15:40,660
-Hello?
-Buon giorno, Mr. Eisenhower.

968
01:15:40,827 --> 01:15:42,995
This is your 5 a.m. wake-up call.

969
01:15:43,163 --> 01:15:45,456
-Really?
-Yes, I'm afraid.

970
01:15:45,624 --> 01:15:47,625
Have a nice day, sir.

971
01:15:58,053 --> 01:16:00,763
-Hey.
-What are you doing?

972
01:16:00,931 --> 01:16:06,060
-What--? Sleeping. Why are you dressed?
-It's 5:30, day of. We gotta go. Let's go.

973
01:16:06,895 --> 01:16:08,938
It's 11:30.

974
01:16:10,816 --> 01:16:12,733
The night before.

975
01:16:16,196 --> 01:16:17,488
But....

976
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:25,496
Oh, he's mean.
He's just mean-spirited.

977
01:16:25,664 --> 01:16:27,707
-How many espressos did you have?
-Five.

978
01:16:27,874 --> 01:16:29,542
Yeah, come on.

979
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:41,429
I don't know if she's just confused...

980
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:44,432
...or she's really turned the corner
and hates me now.

981
01:16:45,976 --> 01:16:48,269
You think I handled this wrong?

982
01:16:48,854 --> 01:16:51,272
I was too forceful.
I was too American.

983
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,190
She's different.

984
01:16:54,484 --> 01:16:57,320
Maybe you're right'
maybe she has moved on.

985
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:02,950
You know, I talked to a doctor
about getting that tattoo removed.

986
01:17:07,581 --> 01:17:11,626
But given its location,
he advised against it.

987
01:17:16,673 --> 01:17:19,634
That guy doing Potsie is unbelievable.

988
01:20:23,944 --> 01:20:25,236
I mean, what's this guy's problem?

989
01:20:25,737 --> 01:20:30,115
He's stitched us up twice in two weeks,
all over his ego.

990
01:20:30,283 --> 01:20:33,577
It's the first decent evening we've
had together in I don't know how long.

991
01:20:33,745 --> 01:20:36,497
All right, all right,
let's just stay on point here.

992
01:20:36,665 --> 01:20:38,415
Let's go over the list again.

993
01:20:38,583 --> 01:20:40,960
Who died and made you Danny?

994
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:46,549
No one.

995
01:20:46,716 --> 01:20:49,176
I'm sorry. My emotions
are all over the place.

996
01:20:49,344 --> 01:20:51,846
I was forceful, trying
to show good leadership--

997
01:20:52,013 --> 01:20:54,181
-For fuck's sake. Let's go.
-You're a good leader.

998
01:20:54,349 --> 01:20:55,724
Thanks.

999
01:20:56,101 --> 01:20:58,561
All right, well,
let's go over the list again.

1000
01:20:58,728 --> 01:21:00,312
-Swinging Priest?
-Not enough people.

1001
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:01,939
-Crazy Larry?
-Not enough people.

1002
01:21:02,107 --> 01:21:03,941
-Soft Shoulder?
-Not enough people.

1003
01:21:04,109 --> 01:21:06,610
-Baker's Dozen?
-No woman and not enough people.

1004
01:21:06,778 --> 01:21:08,153
Hell in a Handbasket?

1005
01:21:08,321 --> 01:21:12,741
We can't train a cat that quickly.
And not enough people.

1006
01:21:14,911 --> 01:21:17,538
-What about Tess?
-What about her?

1007
01:21:17,706 --> 01:21:19,957
Well, you know how she
kind of looks like--

1008
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:22,001
-So what?
-Yeah, what's your point?

1009
01:21:22,168 --> 01:21:24,128
So we do a Lookie-loo.

1010
01:21:24,921 --> 01:21:28,757
-It's a Lookie-loo with a Bundle of Joy.
-A Lookie-loo with Tess...

1011
01:21:28,925 --> 01:21:30,259
...and a Bundle of Joy?

1012
01:21:30,427 --> 01:21:33,178
You've gone right out of your tree,
my son. He's mad.

1013
01:21:33,346 --> 01:21:36,765
It's crazy. It's Italian-television crazy,
and we're still one short.

1014
01:21:36,933 --> 01:21:42,062
No, think about it. She can get near the egg
during daylight with half the system down.

1015
01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:44,148
I mean, that's a trifecta.

1016
01:21:48,653 --> 01:21:51,614
He might be right. Make the calls.

1017
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:57,995
Linus CaldWell, you are not
following the procedures...

1018
01:21:58,163 --> 01:22:00,915
...Danny talked about
if Terry Benedict shows up.

1019
01:22:01,082 --> 01:22:02,875
Something is wrong. What is wrong?

1020
01:22:03,043 --> 01:22:04,668
Danny's fine. He's with Rusty.

1021
01:22:04,836 --> 01:22:08,005
During this part of the plan,
they can't communicate with us.

1022
01:22:08,173 --> 01:22:09,632
Promise he isn't hurt.

1023
01:22:09,799 --> 01:22:12,051
I promise he isn't hurt.

1024
01:22:13,011 --> 01:22:14,678
You're gonna miss the deadline.

1025
01:22:14,846 --> 01:22:18,557
Danny would be thrilled if you met him
in Rome when the job's finished.

1026
01:22:18,725 --> 01:22:20,184
He misses you like crazy.

1027
01:22:20,352 --> 01:22:23,312
Plus, you studied art,
so I know how much you love Rome.

1028
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:25,731
There's no downside here.

1029
01:22:27,192 --> 01:22:29,818
Wow, they're bringing you
along fast, aren't they?

1030
01:22:29,986 --> 01:22:32,029
Yes. Danny would be more thrilled...

1031
01:22:32,197 --> 01:22:36,450
...if you were on the 7 p.m. out of JFK,
which means you have to leave right now.

1032
01:23:05,605 --> 01:23:08,482
I thought I'd requested a midsize.

1033
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:11,902
-Danny here?
-He wanted to be.

1034
01:23:18,034 --> 01:23:22,287
Did you have a nice flight? We weren't
sure if you were a window or aisle person.

1035
01:23:22,455 --> 01:23:25,833
-How long's Danny been in jail?
-Just a couple of days, really.

1036
01:23:26,001 --> 01:23:30,671
Which, you know, on the bright side,
he's completely safe from Benedict.

1037
01:23:30,839 --> 01:23:33,549
He told me everything was fine.
He lied right to me.

1038
01:23:33,717 --> 01:23:37,469
What I think he meant by "fine"
is We're running low on time and money...

1039
01:23:37,637 --> 01:23:40,723
...and we're deeper in debt
than when we started.

1040
01:23:40,890 --> 01:23:43,517
I assume that you have a plan
to get him out.

1041
01:23:43,685 --> 01:23:47,104
-Actually, she sounds like her.
-No, she needs a Southern accent.

1042
01:23:47,272 --> 01:23:50,816
-Can you do a Southern--?
-What the hell is going on with you guys?

1043
01:23:50,984 --> 01:23:54,611
Not quite. The accent is crucial.
It's the first thing people notice.

1044
01:23:54,779 --> 01:23:57,740
-This ridiculous car, what is it doing?
-Okay, I'm sorry.

1045
01:23:57,907 --> 01:24:03,579
All right, I'm just gonna level with you.
Due to certain personnel losses...

1046
01:24:03,747 --> 01:24:05,998
...that We have sustained...

1047
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:09,251
...we're-- Various readjustments
had to be made.

1048
01:24:09,419 --> 01:24:12,212
You're gonna have to play a small role
in this thing.

1049
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:14,256
Okay? So can you put these on?

1050
01:24:15,383 --> 01:24:18,510
I'd like you to put this hat on.

1051
01:24:18,678 --> 01:24:22,181
You're gonna put on that,
and you're gonna stuff it with that.

1052
01:24:22,348 --> 01:24:27,019
And we'll turn around,
just give you a little moment.

1053
01:24:27,187 --> 01:24:29,021
Small role.

1054
01:24:29,189 --> 01:24:31,231
Who am I supposed to be?

1055
01:24:32,442 --> 01:24:33,734
Well....

1056
01:24:36,112 --> 01:24:37,488
Oh, really?

1057
01:24:37,655 --> 01:24:39,990
Well, absolutely.

1058
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:45,287
I can have-- We can make
the suite available.

1059
01:24:45,455 --> 01:24:47,247
No, no, no trouble at all.

1060
01:24:47,415 --> 01:24:51,877
I mean, We would love-- We are honored
that she would think of us again.

1061
01:24:52,045 --> 01:24:53,670
Okay.

1062
01:24:53,838 --> 01:24:55,255
Okay. Thank you.

1063
01:24:55,423 --> 01:24:57,299
Bye.

1064
01:25:07,102 --> 01:25:09,645
How is this going to get Danny out?

1065
01:25:09,813 --> 01:25:13,023
-We needed someone famous.
-Why didn't you get someone famous?

1066
01:25:13,191 --> 01:25:15,859
Just think Four Weddings and a Funeral.

1067
01:25:16,027 --> 01:25:18,195
She wasn't in
Four Weddings and a Funeral.

1068
01:25:18,363 --> 01:25:21,365
"I." "I wasn't in
Four Weddings and a Funeral."

1069
01:25:21,533 --> 01:25:23,534
Just protect your fake baby.

1070
01:25:25,703 --> 01:25:26,954
I'm hyperventilating.

1071
01:25:27,122 --> 01:25:30,374
-Welcome back, Signora Roberts.
-Thank you. She's very tired.

1072
01:25:32,001 --> 01:25:33,585
-Take it. Take it.
-Okay.

1073
01:25:35,421 --> 01:25:38,173
Oh, let's hide. Let's hide.

1074
01:25:39,759 --> 01:25:41,343
Julia?

1075
01:25:41,511 --> 01:25:43,887
My name is Teresa.

1076
01:25:49,227 --> 01:25:52,020
I thought I saw a friend of mine,
someone that I know.

1077
01:25:52,188 --> 01:25:55,899
No, absolutely not. You can't turn off
the pressure sensors. No.

1078
01:25:57,235 --> 01:25:58,569
Well, she can't touch it.

1079
01:25:58,736 --> 01:26:01,947
She's a movie star.
She's not the pope, for chrissake.

1080
01:26:02,448 --> 01:26:04,908
You're from Smyrna, Georgia.
You were born in 1967.

1081
01:26:05,076 --> 01:26:08,162
-You like croquet and knitting.
-Your middle name is Fiona.

1082
01:26:08,329 --> 01:26:10,164
You've got 10 dogs, seven horses.

1083
01:26:10,331 --> 01:26:13,917
-Your favorite color is peach.
-She doesn't have more horses than dogs.

1084
01:26:14,085 --> 01:26:16,795
-I can't do this. I can't.
-Tess, we're out of time.

1085
01:26:16,963 --> 01:26:18,213
-"Julia," please.
-Julia.

1086
01:26:18,381 --> 01:26:22,009
No, we understand you're feeling
insecure. That is totally natural.

1087
01:26:22,177 --> 01:26:26,763
-You're playing an actress. They're insecure.
-No, I'm not insecure. I'm freaking out.

1088
01:26:26,931 --> 01:26:28,515
-Yes. That's right.
-Brilliant!

1089
01:26:28,683 --> 01:26:29,933
You're playing a role.

1090
01:26:30,101 --> 01:26:33,437
No, you're playing a role.
I'm apparently playing a real person.

1091
01:26:33,605 --> 01:26:37,691
-Yeah, so?
-It's just wrong.

1092
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:43,780
You mean, like, morally?

1093
01:26:43,948 --> 01:26:46,325
No. Well, yes.

1094
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:50,370
Probably-- It's not the point.
The point is you want me to speak...

1095
01:26:50,538 --> 01:26:53,332
...for someone who's out there somewhere.
It's too personal.

1096
01:26:53,499 --> 01:26:56,043
More personal than your husband
doing 25-to-life?

1097
01:26:56,211 --> 01:26:59,671
He won't do 25-to-life. Benedict will
have him killed immediately.

1098
01:26:59,839 --> 01:27:01,798
-Don't.
-I'm sorry, that was stupid.

1099
01:27:01,966 --> 01:27:06,011
We're gonna be in and out in 10 minutes.
We have to. That's our time frame.

1100
01:27:06,179 --> 01:27:09,973
You don't even have to talk. Give them
a big smile, wave at the cameras.

1101
01:27:10,141 --> 01:27:13,143
-That's all she ever does.
-But if you do say something...

1102
01:27:13,311 --> 01:27:17,147
...don't forget your accent.
Drop your G's, and longer vowels.

1103
01:27:17,315 --> 01:27:18,815
Room service.

1104
01:27:18,983 --> 01:27:21,652
It's gonna be fine.
You've gotta remember something.

1105
01:27:21,819 --> 01:27:24,863
You are an image to these people.
You're like an object.

1106
01:27:25,031 --> 01:27:29,201
Nobody actually knows you.
The last thing this is gonna be is personal.

1107
01:27:34,123 --> 01:27:36,333
-Aren't you overdue?
-Why are you in Rome?

1108
01:27:36,501 --> 01:27:39,461
-I'm here on vacation.
-I love you.

1109
01:27:39,796 --> 01:27:42,631
You are not supposed to fly
eight months pregnant.

1110
01:27:42,799 --> 01:27:44,007
-I know.
-ls Danny here?

1111
01:27:44,175 --> 01:27:45,801
-Of course.
-Danny.

1112
01:27:45,969 --> 01:27:48,053
-No, no, I mean, he has--
-He's working?

1113
01:27:48,221 --> 01:27:50,931
-Yes. Yes and no. He's working.
-ln Rome?

1114
01:27:51,099 --> 01:27:53,517
-Bruce. Glen Snackwell, publicity.
-Hey, Glen.

1115
01:27:53,685 --> 01:27:54,977
-I'm a big fan.
-Thanks.

1116
01:27:55,144 --> 01:27:56,728
Great. You fired Marcy?

1117
01:27:56,896 --> 01:28:00,482
You fired Marcy. Two weeks ago,
you told me I should go with Marcy.

1118
01:28:00,650 --> 01:28:03,527
-I'm sorry.
-Tell him what happened with Marcy, Glen.

1119
01:28:03,695 --> 01:28:06,029
-There's a story?
-Always a story with Marcy.

1120
01:28:06,197 --> 01:28:08,657
-Marcy-- Marcy....
-You look fantastic.

1121
01:28:08,825 --> 01:28:10,993
-Such a surprise.
-You should sit down.

1122
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:14,288
I'm with the studio.
Marcy's still very much in the picture.

1123
01:28:14,789 --> 01:28:16,832
I just wanted to get you for a second.

1124
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:20,210
We're looking to come off
this baby thing strong.

1125
01:28:20,378 --> 01:28:24,548
You know, that little statue on the mantle
starts smirking at you after a while.

1126
01:28:24,716 --> 01:28:26,341
You know what I'm saying?

1127
01:28:27,385 --> 01:28:30,512
-Not really, Glen, no.
-Sorry. Yeah.

1128
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:32,472
Hey, Jules, that reminds me.

1129
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:36,059
I've been meaning to call you
since the girls and I were in Taos.

1130
01:28:36,227 --> 01:28:40,564
-It's so good to see you.
-Come here. These are a mess.

1131
01:28:40,732 --> 01:28:44,026
Anyway, Tallulah left her
SpongeBob blanket in the red casita.

1132
01:28:44,193 --> 01:28:46,111
-Okay.
-So, what I wanna do-- Here.

1133
01:28:46,279 --> 01:28:47,738
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1134
01:28:48,031 --> 01:28:50,240
-Thanks, Bruce.
-ls call Marcus...

1135
01:28:50,408 --> 01:28:55,078
...and have him get ahold of Louise
so we can make arrangements to get it.

1136
01:28:55,246 --> 01:28:57,122
He's home now, right?

1137
01:28:58,416 --> 01:29:00,584
-Marcus--
-I need to talk to Marcus.

1138
01:29:00,752 --> 01:29:04,546
-That's so funny. What a coincidence.
-Go ahead. Talk to him.

1139
01:29:04,714 --> 01:29:06,798
Over by the window, with the reception.

1140
01:29:06,966 --> 01:29:09,801
-Hello?
-Hello, Marcus?

1141
01:29:10,261 --> 01:29:13,096
No, it's Julia. Who's this?

1142
01:29:13,264 --> 01:29:15,807
It's Julia. I'm with Bruce Willis.

1143
01:29:15,975 --> 01:29:17,642
You're with Bruce right now?

1144
01:29:17,810 --> 01:29:20,562
Can I speak with him?
Oh, yes, Tallulah's SpongeBob.

1145
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:23,774
-I'm sorry, can I talk to him for a sec?
-Did it drop out?

1146
01:29:24,108 --> 01:29:27,444
-Yes, it fell out.
-That's been happening all week.

1147
01:29:27,612 --> 01:29:30,906
-Put that phone away right now.
-What?

1148
01:29:31,074 --> 01:29:32,699
Hang it up and put it away.

1149
01:29:33,117 --> 01:29:35,619
Do you have any idea how vulnerable...

1150
01:29:35,787 --> 01:29:41,041
...a fetus, brain is to the electromagnetic
field created by your cell phone?

1151
01:29:41,209 --> 01:29:44,211
You might as well point a gun
at her stomach.

1152
01:29:44,379 --> 01:29:47,130
-I'm Bruce Willis.
-Simon Leopold.

1153
01:29:47,298 --> 01:29:49,841
-I am Julia's physician.
-He's a doctor.

1154
01:29:50,009 --> 01:29:52,260
What happened to Dr. Webber?

1155
01:29:53,721 --> 01:29:56,598
-You know, Doc...? He was sick.
-Dr. Webber is on vacation.

1156
01:29:56,766 --> 01:29:58,892
-Well, he's sick.
-He's sick on vacation.

1157
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:02,479
-Sick on vacation.
-Don't you hate that? Sick on vacation.

1158
01:30:02,647 --> 01:30:06,358
Sorry to have jumped on you, Mr. Willis.
You do very good actings.

1159
01:30:06,526 --> 01:30:07,776
Thank you.

1160
01:30:07,944 --> 01:30:09,319
-Snackbar.
-Snackwell.

1161
01:30:09,487 --> 01:30:14,658
It doesn't matter. lf we are to get there
at 4:00 and do that....

1162
01:30:14,826 --> 01:30:16,868
-I say 50-50.
-Closer than that.

1163
01:30:17,036 --> 01:30:21,498
-2-1 they don't make it to the museum.
-5-1 they don't make it to the Egg Room.

1164
01:30:22,333 --> 01:30:23,542
What?

1165
01:30:26,129 --> 01:30:28,797
-She's still my wife.
-She's a novice. You said so.

1166
01:30:28,965 --> 01:30:31,383
-Led by an apprentice.
-Being tracked by a pro.

1167
01:30:31,676 --> 01:30:33,301
You want her to win.

1168
01:30:33,469 --> 01:30:35,095
-Which her?
-You know which her.

1169
01:30:35,263 --> 01:30:37,264
-The one that started all this.
-Right.

1170
01:30:37,432 --> 01:30:40,267
-Good. For a minute--
-Why would I say that? It's not her fauIt.

1171
01:30:40,435 --> 01:30:41,852
-It wasn't.
-Okay, then.

1172
01:30:42,019 --> 01:30:43,270
-Good.
-Good.

1173
01:30:43,438 --> 01:30:46,398
-I'm confused.
-Yeah, who are you talking about?

1174
01:30:46,566 --> 01:30:48,358
-lsabel.
-Tess.

1175
01:30:49,944 --> 01:30:53,071
-I loved it, but I figured it out.
-Not a lot of people did.

1176
01:30:53,239 --> 01:30:55,490
-That's amazing.
-The second she doesn't...

1177
01:30:55,658 --> 01:30:57,868
...talk to you in the restaurant, I knew--

1178
01:30:58,035 --> 01:30:59,286
You figured that out.

1179
01:30:59,454 --> 01:31:02,497
-Yeah, I mean, the movie still works for me.
-Great.

1180
01:31:02,999 --> 01:31:06,376
Can We just--? Does she really
need to be rushing this quickly?

1181
01:31:06,794 --> 01:31:09,129
-She's practically jogging.
-ln Thailand...

1182
01:31:09,297 --> 01:31:13,508
...mothers routinely give birth in
rice paddies and then go right back to work.

1183
01:31:13,676 --> 01:31:16,136
-Amazing women over there.
-Rice paddy?

1184
01:31:16,304 --> 01:31:19,723
She will not have it in a rice paddy.
She'll be at her own paddy.

1185
01:31:19,891 --> 01:31:23,101
And she will be very comfortable
because she will be strong...

1186
01:31:23,269 --> 01:31:25,896
...from this walk and this exercise.

1187
01:32:02,683 --> 01:32:04,476
Was she worth it?

1188
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:07,229
Was Tess?

1189
01:32:10,566 --> 01:32:14,694
The moment that she doesn't talk to you
in the restaurant, I knew.

1190
01:32:14,987 --> 01:32:16,821
-Your friends didn't tell you?
-No.

1191
01:32:16,989 --> 01:32:19,282
-That's when you figured it out, huh?
-Yeah.

1192
01:32:19,450 --> 01:32:23,370
-But the movie was still enjoyable for me.
-Okay. Thanks.

1193
01:32:24,872 --> 01:32:29,459
lf everybody's so freaking smart, how come
the movie did $675 million worldwide...

1194
01:32:31,629 --> 01:32:33,338
...theatrical?

1195
01:32:33,506 --> 01:32:34,881
Julia. Doctor.

1196
01:32:35,049 --> 01:32:38,426
Doctor, you might wanna
call the rice paddy now.

1197
01:32:40,179 --> 01:32:44,975
Seal off the museum. Nobody in or out.

1198
01:32:45,977 --> 01:32:48,770
-Bring-- Bring it, bring it.
-Quickly, quickly.

1199
01:32:48,938 --> 01:32:51,731
-Sit her down. Sit her down.
-Everybody just relax.

1200
01:32:52,149 --> 01:32:55,735
-Can you hear me? Talk to me.
-She is fine. She is fine.

1201
01:32:55,903 --> 01:32:59,322
She's good? Okay, that's it.
We're done here. No more pictures.

1202
01:32:59,490 --> 01:33:01,783
-Thank you, Bruce Willis.
-Just don't worry.

1203
01:33:01,951 --> 01:33:05,996
-Thank you, museum. We are code four.
-Walk slowly, like you're doing.

1204
01:33:06,163 --> 01:33:09,624
We'll get you into the car
as fast as we can.

1205
01:33:13,879 --> 01:33:16,047
Okay, we're not stopping. Don't stop.

1206
01:33:16,215 --> 01:33:17,882
-Hello.
-We're on our way out.

1207
01:33:18,050 --> 01:33:22,095
Isabel Lahiri, I'm with the museum.
It is so great to meet you.

1208
01:33:22,263 --> 01:33:24,931
-We're very late.
-I'm sorry, this won't take long.

1209
01:33:25,099 --> 01:33:29,519
I don't wanna be an annoying fan'
but my boyfriend is such a huge fan.

1210
01:33:29,687 --> 01:33:32,897
I can't let you leave unless you sign
something for him. Do you mind?

1211
01:33:33,065 --> 01:33:35,942
-That's very unorthodox.
-Sorry, it won't take long.

1212
01:33:36,110 --> 01:33:38,320
-What's his name?
-His name's Robert.

1213
01:33:38,487 --> 01:33:40,905
Aren't you a lefty?
I thought you were a lefty.

1214
01:33:41,073 --> 01:33:43,199
She is a lefty.

1215
01:33:43,367 --> 01:33:45,535
Often pregnant women
become ambidextrous.

1216
01:33:45,703 --> 01:33:48,038
You are a big fan.

1217
01:33:48,205 --> 01:33:50,915
She doesn't necessarily
have to sign lefty.

1218
01:33:51,334 --> 01:33:53,877
Oh, thanks so much. This is great.

1219
01:33:54,045 --> 01:33:55,545
Okay. We're on the move.

1220
01:33:55,713 --> 01:33:58,006
Thank you. You take care, now.

1221
01:33:58,174 --> 01:34:00,925
And one more thing.
I just got off the phone...

1222
01:34:01,093 --> 01:34:06,348
...with someone called Marcy who put you
on a plane from Taos, New Mexico to L.A...

1223
01:34:06,515 --> 01:34:12,270
...where you have a 1:00 meeting
about a film, Clowns Can't Sleep.

1224
01:34:12,438 --> 01:34:16,650
Anyway, she just wanted me to let you
know everyone's running a little late...

1225
01:34:16,817 --> 01:34:20,612
...and was wondering if you could
make it at 1:30 instead.

1226
01:34:20,780 --> 01:34:22,822
I knew it.

1227
01:34:22,990 --> 01:34:24,991
Shame on you.

1228
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:27,869
I don't think we've met. Bruce.

1229
01:34:28,037 --> 01:34:30,372
Isabel Lahiri. Nice to meet you.

1230
01:34:30,706 --> 01:34:32,332
Do you really have a boyfriend?

1231
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:36,586
Or were you just--? Was that just
part of the whole thing with them?

1232
01:35:14,125 --> 01:35:16,668
So how'd it go?

1233
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:51,077
You Lahiri?

1234
01:35:52,079 --> 01:35:54,497
I'm Section Chief Molly Starr.

1235
01:35:54,665 --> 01:35:58,752
I spoke to a very nice man at Europol
this morning, Commissioner Greisman.

1236
01:35:58,919 --> 01:36:01,713
He wants you on the next flight
to Amsterdam.

1237
01:36:01,881 --> 01:36:05,008
There seems to be some irregularity
with your paperwork.

1238
01:36:39,460 --> 01:36:41,211
That one.

1239
01:36:41,378 --> 01:36:43,546
Let's start with that one.

1240
01:36:45,049 --> 01:36:48,009
lmagine yourself in a room...

1241
01:36:48,177 --> 01:36:53,223
...that's too short for you to stand up in
and not wide enough for you to lie down in.

1242
01:36:53,390 --> 01:36:56,559
A room with no light, no heat...

1243
01:36:56,727 --> 01:37:00,522
...and stone walls scratched by the teeth
and nails of desperate men...

1244
01:37:00,689 --> 01:37:03,358
...men driven crazy by isolation.

1245
01:37:04,485 --> 01:37:07,195
You will have rats for company...

1246
01:37:07,363 --> 01:37:11,658
...and a small window that looks out
on the world that has passed you by.

1247
01:37:12,201 --> 01:37:17,205
Your parents will grow old and die,
just like your dreams.

1248
01:37:17,540 --> 01:37:21,125
Your friends will forget your name,
tell your stories as their own...

1249
01:37:21,293 --> 01:37:25,129
...because what good is a story when
the person who owns it has vanished?

1250
01:37:25,297 --> 01:37:27,841
-What do you want?
-Testify against the others...

1251
01:37:28,008 --> 01:37:29,968
...in the Benedict case.

1252
01:37:30,135 --> 01:37:32,053
The Italian charges will be dropped.

1253
01:37:32,221 --> 01:37:35,765
You and the others will be extradited
to the U.S. this afternoon.

1254
01:37:36,559 --> 01:37:39,936
Plead, and you walk with parole.

1255
01:37:41,856 --> 01:37:43,439
I can't.

1256
01:37:51,824 --> 01:37:55,326
Think about it, Linus.

1257
01:37:56,537 --> 01:37:59,873
For a moment there,
I was already forgetting your name.

1258
01:38:03,043 --> 01:38:04,419
Wait.

1259
01:38:08,966 --> 01:38:11,259
Just hang on a sec.

1260
01:39:22,539 --> 01:39:24,207
Linus.

1261
01:39:25,626 --> 01:39:28,044
Right. Thanks.

1262
01:39:28,921 --> 01:39:30,922
You okay?

1263
01:39:31,715 --> 01:39:34,717
-Well, I blew the meet with Matsui.
-Matsui?

1264
01:39:35,052 --> 01:39:38,388
Let me guess. He pulled
a Lost in Translation on you.

1265
01:39:41,308 --> 01:39:43,851
That's his idea of fun for first-timers.

1266
01:39:44,019 --> 01:39:48,231
-I mean-- How do I not see these things?
-Don't get down on yourself.

1267
01:39:48,399 --> 01:39:50,108
-Obvious.
-We talked about this.

1268
01:39:50,275 --> 01:39:55,113
I hope Danny and Rusty appreciate the job
you did in a tight jam. I am proud of you.

1269
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:57,490
-Thanks.
-We both are.

1270
01:39:58,659 --> 01:40:01,244
-You--? You told Dad?
-I had to, sweetheart.

1271
01:40:01,412 --> 01:40:03,496
-You told Dad?
-We Were on vacation.

1272
01:40:03,789 --> 01:40:05,415
I'm sorry.

1273
01:40:05,582 --> 01:40:09,335
Great. Thanks. You're gonna be
dining out on this one for months.

1274
01:40:09,503 --> 01:40:12,839
"Hey, remember the time your mom
had to come to Rome...."

1275
01:40:13,507 --> 01:40:14,882
I'm sorry.

1276
01:40:15,050 --> 01:40:17,218
Every time with him. It's like....

1277
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:20,972
It's like a....
It's like a....

1278
01:40:21,849 --> 01:40:25,226
That was for keeping me in the dark.
And that-- That...

1279
01:40:25,394 --> 01:40:27,603
...is for making me a master thief.

1280
01:40:27,771 --> 01:40:29,897
-And that...
-Okay.

1281
01:40:30,065 --> 01:40:33,401
...is for ruining our
second third anniversary.

1282
01:40:33,569 --> 01:40:37,530
Okay. Okay? Come here.

1283
01:40:44,288 --> 01:40:46,706
I'm sorry I kept you in the dark.

1284
01:40:49,460 --> 01:40:51,627
I'm sorry that I made you a thief.

1285
01:40:51,795 --> 01:40:54,547
-Master.
-Master thief.

1286
01:41:01,346 --> 01:41:07,894
And I'm very sorry that I ruined
our second third anniversary.

1287
01:41:08,812 --> 01:41:12,231
-Okay?
-Okay.

1288
01:41:13,567 --> 01:41:15,735
You forgive me?

1289
01:41:15,903 --> 01:41:18,738
-A little.
-All right.

1290
01:41:18,906 --> 01:41:20,907
What was Bruce Willis like? Was he--?

1291
01:41:29,166 --> 01:41:33,086
Follow it. That's Ryan's car.
Follow that one.

1292
01:41:57,653 --> 01:41:59,946
Hey, wait, wait!

1293
01:42:00,531 --> 01:42:02,949
What the hell is going on?

1294
01:42:03,700 --> 01:42:06,285
Your father's alive, lzzy.

1295
01:42:08,330 --> 01:42:09,539
Your mom lied to you...

1296
01:42:09,706 --> 01:42:13,292
-...to keep you from him. He's alive.
-What are you talking about?

1297
01:42:13,460 --> 01:42:17,463
When they divorced, she told him if he
contacted you, she'd go to the cops...

1298
01:42:17,631 --> 01:42:19,757
...with everything to put him in jail.

1299
01:42:19,925 --> 01:42:21,884
How do you know that?

1300
01:42:22,052 --> 01:42:25,304
And why should I believe you?
I don't believe you, okay?

1301
01:42:35,315 --> 01:42:37,233
You know where he is?

1302
01:42:37,401 --> 01:42:39,485
I know somebody who does.

1303
01:42:46,785 --> 01:42:50,329
There's nothing back there
but a forged 1077.

1304
01:44:31,556 --> 01:44:34,183
-No. Really? No.
-No.

1305
01:44:34,351 --> 01:44:36,018
That'd be horrible.

1306
01:44:36,186 --> 01:44:38,521
It's hard, you know, for dinners.

1307
01:44:38,689 --> 01:44:42,400
Well, you must have very good contacts.

1308
01:44:42,567 --> 01:44:46,112
I hear it usually takes days
to buy your way out.

1309
01:44:47,072 --> 01:44:51,075
-Tess, this is François Toulour.
-Madame Ocean, at last.

1310
01:44:51,243 --> 01:44:52,618
-Hello.
-He's French.

1311
01:44:52,786 --> 01:44:55,288
Shouldn't you be somewhere else
by now, like...

1312
01:44:55,580 --> 01:44:58,457
...Outer Mongolia, maybe?

1313
01:44:58,625 --> 01:45:02,545
Well, before We get to that,
we just wanted to ask you one question.

1314
01:45:02,713 --> 01:45:04,338
-What is that?
-How'd you do it?

1315
01:45:04,506 --> 01:45:07,967
Oh, so that's why you came.
You wanna know.

1316
01:45:08,635 --> 01:45:11,220
Well, I guess that's normal.

1317
01:45:12,431 --> 01:45:14,890
But I got another deal for you.

1318
01:45:15,058 --> 01:45:19,145
You both recognize that I'm the best,
and I'll tell you my secret.

1319
01:45:20,147 --> 01:45:22,815
-Yeah.
-That....

1320
01:45:24,735 --> 01:45:28,487
Make it if you get him to tell us...

1321
01:45:28,655 --> 01:45:31,157
-...and tell him that he is the best.
-Oh, okay.

1322
01:45:31,325 --> 01:45:36,495
-I won't tell him because you're the best.
-All right. Thank you.

1323
01:45:37,247 --> 01:45:38,956
All right.

1324
01:45:39,124 --> 01:45:43,836
We'll tell you you're the best
after you tell us how you did it.

1325
01:45:49,634 --> 01:45:53,012
How can I refuse
a dying man's last request?

1326
01:45:55,891 --> 01:46:01,228
The egg arrived in Rome at 6:45 p.m.
the Saturday before it went on display.

1327
01:46:01,396 --> 01:46:04,690
-It was at the museum by 8 p.m.
-Wait a minute, hold on.

1328
01:46:04,858 --> 01:46:07,777
You stole it that evening?
With the museum locked down?

1329
01:46:07,944 --> 01:46:11,155
How'd you get in the building?
How'd you get past the sensors?

1330
01:46:11,365 --> 01:46:13,115
Why didn't my recon team see you?

1331
01:46:13,283 --> 01:46:16,660
-Don't touch my thing.
-I didn't touch your thing. Like it works.

1332
01:46:16,828 --> 01:46:20,373
You got greasy hands, you put them
on the lens. Now I can't see.

1333
01:46:20,540 --> 01:46:23,626
-You can't see anything.
-I see you. You look like a retard.

1334
01:46:23,794 --> 01:46:25,086
You look like a retard.

1335
01:46:25,253 --> 01:46:29,673
I'll pay you a million dollars if you don't
speak for a month. One month.

1336
01:46:29,841 --> 01:46:35,012
-I wanna eat your whole head.
-Go ahead. A million dollars. No joke.

1337
01:46:35,514 --> 01:46:38,682
Right. With no equipment, no rope.

1338
01:46:38,850 --> 01:46:42,478
Of course. Come on, don't tell me
you don't know how to do that.

1339
01:46:42,646 --> 01:46:45,898
How did you get by the laser field
in the Great Hall?

1340
01:46:48,318 --> 01:46:52,613
The laser fields. Well....

1341
01:48:39,763 --> 01:48:43,599
Okay. Toulour, you're the best.

1342
01:48:43,767 --> 01:48:46,560
Well, thank you, Danny.

1343
01:48:46,728 --> 01:48:51,482
Good. Now, if you can just
get us our money...

1344
01:48:51,650 --> 01:48:53,359
...we'll be going.

1345
01:48:55,028 --> 01:48:56,737
The money?

1346
01:48:57,447 --> 01:48:58,822
What money?

1347
01:48:58,990 --> 01:49:01,784
The money that you agreed
to pay Benedict if we won.

1348
01:49:01,952 --> 01:49:06,080
-We're under a deadline.
-No, no, no, you don't understand.

1349
01:49:06,248 --> 01:49:08,332
You didn't win.

1350
01:49:08,500 --> 01:49:11,252
You lost. And not only did you lose...

1351
01:49:11,419 --> 01:49:14,588
...your entire crew got pinched.
I gotta tell you something.

1352
01:49:14,881 --> 01:49:18,592
You don't look anything like her.
Eventually, the nose, but the ears--

1353
01:49:18,760 --> 01:49:21,136
I mean, the way you walk
and you dress....

1354
01:49:41,324 --> 01:49:45,160
That means that you spoke to LeMarc.

1355
01:49:47,122 --> 01:49:48,706
You spoke to LeMarc?

1356
01:49:57,591 --> 01:50:02,636
Since I'm dead, I think my involvement
in this should stay among the three of us.

1357
01:50:02,804 --> 01:50:04,054
-Of course.
-Absolutely.

1358
01:50:04,222 --> 01:50:09,935
It's ironic that the solution to all of
our problems will be provided by Toulour.

1359
01:50:10,103 --> 01:50:14,857
I'm sure I provoked him by agreeing with my
American friend that you might be better.

1360
01:50:15,025 --> 01:50:18,110
I apologize sincerely for the trouble
I've caused you.

1361
01:50:18,278 --> 01:50:20,487
-There's no need.
-Especially now.

1362
01:50:20,780 --> 01:50:25,451
Remember, from the time you see Toulour
at his villa and the challenge begins...

1363
01:50:25,619 --> 01:50:30,789
...you must assume he will have you
under surveillance everywhere you go.

1364
01:50:31,291 --> 01:50:34,877
You'll have to put on
a very elaborate show.

1365
01:50:35,170 --> 01:50:38,213
The egg, the real egg...

1366
01:50:38,381 --> 01:50:41,925
...will be carried in a backpack
on a train leaving Gare du Nord...

1367
01:50:42,093 --> 01:50:45,054
-...at 9:30 a.m.
-Thank you.

1368
01:50:45,221 --> 01:50:47,181
You saved our lives, Gaspar.

1369
01:50:47,349 --> 01:50:51,101
Yeah. And I'm still getting
the better of you.

1370
01:53:03,109 --> 01:53:05,319
And I stole a replica?

1371
01:53:06,321 --> 01:53:10,616
Your paintings are in a high-security
warehouse in Milan.

1372
01:53:10,784 --> 01:53:15,537
It's 1 Via Andreotti, unit 222.

1373
01:53:15,705 --> 01:53:21,752
-Security code is 2-3-1-1-6--
-6-4-6. Thank you.

1374
01:53:23,671 --> 01:53:28,217
Listen, all games aside, that was--
That was very good.

1375
01:53:28,384 --> 01:53:30,803
That was good. How'd you do that?

1376
01:53:35,809 --> 01:53:39,978
Well, I told you one story tonight.
I think that'll be enough. So now...

1377
01:53:40,146 --> 01:53:44,983
...if you, both of you, could please....
Now.

1378
01:54:19,394 --> 01:54:23,355
-Whose house is this?
-It belongs to a thief I know in Paris.

1379
01:54:23,815 --> 01:54:25,983
He knows my father?

1380
01:54:26,150 --> 01:54:28,569
Probably better than anyone.

1381
01:54:29,904 --> 01:54:31,238
Who is he?

1382
01:54:31,406 --> 01:54:35,117
-He helped with the whole Night Fox thing.
-What's his name?

1383
01:54:35,285 --> 01:54:38,745
His real name? I don't know, actually.

1384
01:54:41,666 --> 01:54:44,001
I've only known him as LeMarc.

1385
01:54:44,168 --> 01:54:45,836
LeMarc?

1386
01:54:57,891 --> 01:54:59,808
Oh, my God.

1387
01:55:16,367 --> 01:55:18,619
Where the hell have you been?

1388
01:55:19,662 --> 01:55:21,663
Waiting.

1389
01:55:22,248 --> 01:55:24,291
For what?

1390
01:55:24,626 --> 01:55:26,209
For this.

1391
01:55:36,387 --> 01:55:38,764
Oh, my God.

1392
01:56:14,342 --> 01:56:16,385
So we done?

1393
01:56:16,552 --> 01:56:18,303
lssue closed?

1394
01:56:18,888 --> 01:56:22,891
-ls it actually good?
-It's good. Trust me.

1395
01:56:23,059 --> 01:56:26,728
I don't trust you, and I don't trust Ocean.
lf it's good, we're done.

1396
01:56:26,896 --> 01:56:29,982
These grudges, they're awful.
Nobody wins.

1397
01:56:30,149 --> 01:56:32,484
Danny's had enough of this meshugaas.

1398
01:56:32,652 --> 01:56:35,237
And the competition'
it's worse than our business.

1399
01:56:35,405 --> 01:56:38,156
Always some new young punk
trying to prove himself.

1400
01:56:39,951 --> 01:56:44,746
Guys like Ocean, they keep coming back.
They don't like to lose.

1401
01:56:44,914 --> 01:56:48,834
-Too much ego, too much pride.
-Maybe for some guys, but not Danny.

1402
01:56:49,002 --> 01:56:52,462
Trust me on that.
Danny don't feel like he lost in all this.

1403
01:56:52,630 --> 01:56:55,507
It's hard to believe'
but that's how he feels.

1404
01:56:55,675 --> 01:56:59,720
Well, if he tries anything-- lf anybody
tries anything, I'll be waiting.

1405
01:56:59,887 --> 01:57:02,055
Terry, I can't predict the future.

1406
01:57:02,223 --> 01:57:05,809
I pay professionals to do that,
and even they get it wrong sometimes.

1407
01:57:05,977 --> 01:57:09,104
I can't say that nobody'll ever
try to rob from you again.

1408
01:57:09,272 --> 01:57:14,026
But I can say this: lf, God forbid'
anything does happen to you...

1409
01:57:14,193 --> 01:57:16,278
...we will not be involved.

1410
01:57:16,446 --> 01:57:20,198
You better not be, Reuben.
You better not be.

1411
01:57:34,213 --> 01:57:35,213
Hey.

1412
01:57:37,341 --> 01:57:39,718
Good to see you guys.

1413
01:57:44,640 --> 01:57:48,226
You don't remember? You put me
through hell, and you don't remember?

1414
01:57:49,437 --> 01:57:51,521
-Hey.
-Hey.

1415
01:57:53,775 --> 01:57:56,068
-You're more beautiful than ever.
-Hey!

1416
01:57:57,570 --> 01:57:59,029
-Five-oh-five?
-Four-oh-five.

1417
01:57:59,197 --> 01:58:01,239
-Who's winning?
-I'm little.

1418
01:58:01,407 --> 01:58:02,991
-And you're big.
-You're big?

1419
01:58:03,159 --> 01:58:04,576
Oh, my God.

1420
01:58:05,203 --> 01:58:06,953
-Hello.
-Oh, my God.

1421
01:58:08,873 --> 01:58:10,707
You're all under arrest.

1422
01:58:10,875 --> 01:58:13,001
You're thieves. You're crooks.

1423
01:58:15,046 --> 01:58:17,547
lsabel, Livingston Dell.

1424
01:58:18,216 --> 01:58:19,758
Thank you.

1425
01:58:21,677 --> 01:58:22,761
lsabel, Tess.

1426
01:58:22,929 --> 01:58:25,722
The aduIt table. That's the kids, table.

1427
01:58:26,265 --> 01:58:28,683
-Let me clear that for you.
-I'm in.

1428
01:58:29,435 --> 01:58:30,852
Can I get another beer?

1429
01:58:31,020 --> 01:58:34,106
-I feel I know you.
-Wait, wait. We didn't-- We didn't bet.

1430
01:58:34,649 --> 01:58:35,816
You want five?

1431
01:58:38,986 --> 01:58:40,445
-Five.
-So nasty.

1432
01:58:40,655 --> 01:58:42,197
Okay.

1433
01:58:46,244 --> 01:58:47,494
ls that a joke?

1434
01:58:51,249 --> 01:58:52,833
Yes.

1435
01:58:53,292 --> 01:58:56,419
-Jesus Christ.
-She's drunk!
