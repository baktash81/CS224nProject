1
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:08,985
Nice view.

2
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:00,453
Perfect timing.

3
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,883
Wait a minute. He's not alone.

4
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,927
That's heartbreaking news.

5
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,013
Pull the plug. A kid's in the car.

6
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,015
The drug lord's in the car.

7
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:21,975
Kid took a bad ride, that's all.

8
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,435
Abort the action.

9
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:24,602
You're the rigger.

10
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,855
I'm the trigger. I decide.

11
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:31,484
You just sit back and watch the show.
Okay, sport?

12
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:35,280
Activate the fail-safe, you psycho!

13
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,033
Here's a tip, Ray.
There is no fail-safe.

14
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:41,494
Come on! Come on!

15
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,352
He'll never make it.

16
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:14,879
You're an arrogant man, Raymond.

17
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:18,633
I taught you everything you know,
and you dare to turn on me.

18
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:20,135
Gonna kill me too, colonel?

19
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:24,806
You're a specialist, captain.
You deserve better.

20
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:39,029
Don't forget to write.

21
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,554
You like watching her die?

22
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,431
Taking them down?

23
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,769
Now I'm taking you down.
You're finished in the Agency.

24
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,687
You go in the light...

25
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,482
...you're as dead as those people...

26
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,817
...in the river.

27
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,695
We both are!

28
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,223
Have you decided to take the job?

29
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,309
I saw your ad today.

30
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,728
- I know it's late...
- It's never too late.

31
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:20,857
After all, you're giving me a new life.

32
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:21,941
Really? When?

33
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,527
When you kill those three bastards.

34
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:26,946
I'm flattered.

35
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,574
You better get somebody else.

36
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,826
I like your voice.

37
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:34,537
You don't need an explosive contractor.

38
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,956
Yes, I do.

39
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,709
- You're my only hope.
- Go to court, use the law.

40
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:42,921
The law's been bought.

41
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,130
Use a bullet.

42
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,674
Bullets...

43
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,217
...are imprecise.

44
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:51,846
I heard you control your explosions...
that you shape your charges.

45
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:54,140
What I shape is my business.

46
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:55,934
All I'm saying...

47
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,561
...word is you are the best.

48
00:07:58,770 --> 00:07:59,729
Whose word?

49
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,272
If we could just meet...

50
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,984
I don't meet or work in Miami
and I don't do jobs like this.

51
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,737
Why do you keep calling me back?

52
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:09,698
Why?

53
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,450
I like your voice.

54
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:00,707
Is it my cologne?

55
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,869
They're killers.
You'd be doing the world a favor.

56
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:23,707
I don't owe the world any favors.
Why did you wait so long?

57
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:25,792
I thought...

58
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:28,962
I thought maybe it would pass.

59
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,214
Every day is worse.

60
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:33,425
Remembering what happened.

61
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,886
That's what I do instead of being alive.

62
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:40,265
My father hid me in the closet.

63
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,393
I could still see.

64
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,730
My mother suffered.

65
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,734
They tortured her
to get my father to talk.

66
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,485
We're going to have to kill her.

67
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:56,698
He walked by something
he shouldn't have seen.

68
00:10:57,115 --> 00:11:00,744
They covered his face
with the pillow from my bed.

69
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:01,911
Waste them.

70
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,289
It was too small.

71
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,709
So they shot him.

72
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:09,169
I never thought...

73
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,880
...blood would be so sticky.

74
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:16,551
Sometimes I think
I can never wash it off.

75
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:30,065
The only thing I understand
anymore is revenge.

76
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:33,193
I'm going in, and I'm going
to do it myself.

77
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,487
You'll only get one of them.

78
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,740
That's why I need you.

79
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:43,536
I don't do this kind of job anymore.

80
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:01,096
I know you've been watching me,
trying to decide if...

81
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:05,141
...l'm on the level,
if you're going to take the job.

82
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,602
I can't wait anymore, I'm going in.

83
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:10,105
- They'll make you.
- I have an alias.

84
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:11,981
Adrian Hastings.

85
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,818
Wish me luck.

86
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:49,519
Seòor León.

87
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:56,151
How's it coming in?

88
00:12:56,359 --> 00:13:00,030
Oh, boy. You don't give up.

89
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:04,242
It's packed in Monopoly boxes.

90
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:08,038
That's great, Papa.

91
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:12,751
You get it in.
I'll put it on the street.

92
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:18,340
Come here.

93
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:20,675
- How are you?
- Nice party.

94
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:24,554
You went all out. It's fantastic.

95
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:29,559
- So let's talk numbers.
- Forget business tonight.

96
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:33,772
Go grab yourself a nice mulatta.

97
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:37,359
I want my money.

98
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:41,571
An advance. Small token
of my family's goodwill.

99
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,573
Token?

100
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:46,284
Token.

101
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,997
Listen to me, boy.

102
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:52,582
You know what the Dark Ages are?

103
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,502
The Dark Ages are what I brought
the León family out of.

104
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,379
I computerized your operation.

105
00:13:57,587 --> 00:14:02,717
I streamlined your security.
I dragged you into the 20th century.

106
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:05,095
So don't fuck with me.

107
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:06,554
What is this?

108
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:10,141
A tip? I don't work for tips.
She works for tips.

109
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,602
I want my money. I want it now.

110
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:15,730
Go get it.

111
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:19,818
It's always a pleasure working with you.

112
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:08,950
Champagne, please.

113
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:15,392
Is there something you want?

114
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:18,478
What I want, I take.

115
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,397
Champagne?

116
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:24,192
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

117
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:29,239
Welcome to our bank.

118
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:32,242
I've never seen you before.

119
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,745
I lived here when I was little.

120
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:38,248
A lot's happened since you've been gone.

121
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:39,749
Like what?

122
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,502
Like me.

123
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:45,255
Insecurity is a terrible thing.

124
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:48,049
It would be.

125
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:50,301
I'd like to dance.

126
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,679
What's wrong with keeping
the conversation going?

127
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:57,267
Later. Right now,
I'm taking what I want.

128
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:01,563
You look beautiful tonight!

129
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:43,188
I'll have my driver to pick you up
tomorrow and I'll show you my Miami.

130
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:07,504
Right on time.

131
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:19,182
Should I do it, Timer?

132
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:44,416
- Kind of young to be riding the bus.
- Stop it!

133
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:48,420
What? I'm not good enough for you?

134
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:49,546
I wanna play.

135
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:51,881
Come on, baby...

136
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:56,553
- Stop! Leave me alone!
- Come on now, what's up, huh?

137
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:08,690
Here, you can take my seat.

138
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:11,484
Thank you!

139
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:19,451
That seat's taken.

140
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,244
Fuck you.

141
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:22,912
Excuse me?

142
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:25,707
Fuck you.

143
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:34,090
Hold these, please.

144
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:48,521
What's going on?!

145
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:08,416
I hate knives.

146
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:16,925
Fuck you!
You son of a bitch!

147
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:36,194
I believe there's a vacancy.

148
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:17,819
- What do you drink?
- Martini.

149
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:19,571
Martini on the rocks.

150
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:23,241
Gold tequila, straight up.

151
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:27,120
No one knows Miami like I do.

152
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:30,498
You like spending the day with me?

153
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:33,001
Yeah.

154
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:35,712
Do you?

155
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,713
Kiss me.

156
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:39,716
I hardly know you.

157
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:47,557
Wait till you try to spend the night.

158
00:21:57,108 --> 00:21:59,819
Thanks.

159
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:19,923
Stay here. I must handle something.

160
00:22:20,131 --> 00:22:23,051
Got a light?

161
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:32,394
Is that the piece of shit?

162
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:44,531
Where were you?

163
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:47,325
Home.

164
00:22:49,703 --> 00:22:52,414
Thanks.

165
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,526
What happened to you?

166
00:23:21,735 --> 00:23:25,155
I didn't like the show.

167
00:23:25,155 --> 00:23:26,906
You don't...

168
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:30,493
...walk away from me...

169
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:32,704
...ever.

170
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:34,831
You understand?

171
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,876
Sorry.

172
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:39,502
Get in the car.

173
00:23:39,711 --> 00:23:42,213
Sure.

174
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:05,737
Every time...

175
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:09,407
...he touches me I...

176
00:24:09,741 --> 00:24:10,658
I mean...

177
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:13,203
...he's the man who shot my father!

178
00:24:13,411 --> 00:24:15,997
And he's...

179
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:20,210
...kissing me and...

180
00:24:20,418 --> 00:24:23,421
Oh, God!

181
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:25,256
You don't have to do it.

182
00:24:25,465 --> 00:24:30,387
It's the only way I can get
close enough to kill him!

183
00:24:33,848 --> 00:24:36,643
You see, I have this dream:

184
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:39,771
I'm right there when it happens.

185
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:43,858
He looks at me like I'm a stranger.

186
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:47,529
And I say my name.

187
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:52,534
And it's the last thing he ever hears.

188
00:24:52,867 --> 00:24:54,244
They don't suspect you?

189
00:24:54,452 --> 00:24:58,331
I'm trusted, for the moment.

190
00:24:59,874 --> 00:25:01,668
He's always with you.
How do you live?

191
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:04,379
Alone.

192
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:06,589
That's not what I mean.

193
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:09,175
How do you live...

194
00:25:09,384 --> 00:25:10,593
...with yourself?

195
00:25:10,802 --> 00:25:13,263
How do you?

196
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:32,050
Hey, you!

197
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:36,680
I'm talking to you.

198
00:26:38,056 --> 00:26:39,933
You think you know me?

199
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:43,687
I asked you a question.
Do you think you know me?

200
00:26:43,895 --> 00:26:46,898
'Cause the way you're looking at me,
we must be old friends.

201
00:26:47,107 --> 00:26:48,858
Where did we meet?

202
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:51,361
Nowhere.

203
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:53,905
Nowhere.

204
00:26:54,114 --> 00:26:57,158
You like the bitch?

205
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:05,750
Maybe you like me.

206
00:27:07,252 --> 00:27:10,463
I don't like you.

207
00:27:10,588 --> 00:27:12,924
Then don't stare so hard.

208
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:16,177
Somebody could...

209
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,390
...put something in your eye.

210
00:27:30,442 --> 00:27:33,862
Fucking pervert.

211
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:44,497
Let's move it.

212
00:28:00,138 --> 00:28:02,849
Good night.

213
00:28:06,394 --> 00:28:07,771
Adrian.

214
00:28:07,979 --> 00:28:10,857
Your purse.

215
00:29:25,223 --> 00:29:28,018
Are you listening?

216
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:30,520
The first rule:

217
00:29:30,729 --> 00:29:33,565
Don't go near them again.

218
00:29:33,773 --> 00:29:35,525
Second rule:

219
00:29:35,734 --> 00:29:37,610
Don't contact me.

220
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:38,987
I'll contact you.

221
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:41,197
Maybe I can help you.

222
00:29:41,406 --> 00:29:43,283
Let me see...

223
00:29:43,491 --> 00:29:47,203
They're my problem now and I'm theirs.

224
00:29:49,748 --> 00:29:53,251
Are you close enough to walk over?

225
00:30:00,592 --> 00:30:03,261
Rule three:

226
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,889
If this is a setup...

227
00:30:06,097 --> 00:30:07,223
...I...

228
00:30:07,432 --> 00:30:10,143
...will kill you.

229
00:30:47,138 --> 00:30:49,057
Now what?

230
00:30:49,265 --> 00:30:52,060
That cop was a regular.
Juanita's moving in on me.

231
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:55,021
Get out of here!
I don't solve domestic problems!

232
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:57,941
Asshole!

233
00:31:19,546 --> 00:31:20,630
Don't go anywhere.

234
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:22,632
I'll be right back.

235
00:31:22,841 --> 00:31:25,844
Lucky me.

236
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:59,919
Hey, Charlie!

237
00:32:10,889 --> 00:32:13,808
J & B.

238
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,811
The word is, Manny...

239
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,480
...you're skimming.

240
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:23,109
Somebody's lying.
I never took a dollar.

241
00:32:23,276 --> 00:32:25,612
I hope it ain't you.

242
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:30,283
Because if you're trying
to screw Joe León...

243
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,828
You know me, what, ten years?

244
00:32:34,037 --> 00:32:35,372
I'm clean.

245
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,706
Good.

246
00:32:36,915 --> 00:32:38,750
Very good.

247
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:42,962
Then you have nothing to worry about.

248
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:46,841
Let me see the books.

249
00:33:15,995 --> 00:33:18,081
That is it.

250
00:33:18,289 --> 00:33:22,794
- How about a drink?
- Sure.

251
00:33:24,963 --> 00:33:27,507
September's missing.

252
00:33:27,716 --> 00:33:30,719
See you, Manny.

253
00:33:42,063 --> 00:33:45,066
What do you feel like doing?

254
00:33:55,493 --> 00:33:56,870
What?

255
00:33:57,078 --> 00:33:58,663
I'm working.

256
00:33:58,872 --> 00:34:02,083
You have two hours!

257
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:21,353
Get another job, kid.

258
00:34:32,697 --> 00:34:36,326
They got two bodies in there.
Something that used to be Charlie...

259
00:34:36,534 --> 00:34:39,162
...and a hit on your brothel manager.
That was a bright move.

260
00:34:39,371 --> 00:34:42,207
Something you ordered?
Didn't bother to tell me?

261
00:34:42,415 --> 00:34:43,667
He was a thief.

262
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:46,378
- Tell me about the bomb.
- Very clean.

263
00:34:46,586 --> 00:34:48,838
There was no damage
left or right of the blast.

264
00:34:49,047 --> 00:34:53,426
The arming device was impacted
inside the C-4, so it was vaporized.

265
00:34:53,635 --> 00:34:56,846
Brilliant plan, totally professional.
Must be a specialist.

266
00:34:57,055 --> 00:34:59,391
- This guy is good.
- Yeah, okay.

267
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:04,521
He could put a bomb in your crab shell
and you wouldn't even know it.

268
00:35:04,646 --> 00:35:05,689
I'll kill him!

269
00:35:05,897 --> 00:35:10,610
You can't kill anyone
until we know who he is, can you?

270
00:35:10,819 --> 00:35:11,986
I'll find him.

271
00:35:12,195 --> 00:35:15,824
The important thing to find out
is who he works for.

272
00:35:16,032 --> 00:35:17,575
Maybe he's with the CIA.

273
00:35:17,784 --> 00:35:20,203
Maybe he works for the Mafia.

274
00:35:20,412 --> 00:35:22,664
But we have to find out who.

275
00:35:22,872 --> 00:35:25,333
Overview.

276
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:28,503
What does eliminating Charlie mean
in the overall picture?

277
00:35:28,712 --> 00:35:30,338
- Nothing.
- Less than nothing.

278
00:35:30,547 --> 00:35:32,215
So this target wasn't territorial.

279
00:35:32,424 --> 00:35:34,592
It was personal.

280
00:35:34,801 --> 00:35:36,845
How the fuck do you know so much?

281
00:35:37,053 --> 00:35:40,557
He's guessing. Let me take
a few boys, I'll find this bastard.

282
00:35:40,765 --> 00:35:45,603
Wait a minute. Give me a second.
I have to make a decision.

283
00:35:45,729 --> 00:35:49,524
Little time to think here, huh?

284
00:35:53,778 --> 00:35:56,573
You take over, okay?

285
00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:01,786
I said, Trent will handle it, okay?
I don't hear you saying, "Okay".

286
00:36:01,995 --> 00:36:03,038
- What did you say?
- Okay.

287
00:36:03,246 --> 00:36:06,583
That's nice. Thank you.

288
00:36:08,668 --> 00:36:11,338
Fuck you.

289
00:36:12,797 --> 00:36:15,592
I'll need resources on this one, Joe.

290
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,470
Also, the place was crawling with cops.

291
00:36:18,678 --> 00:36:20,930
I can't be tripping over civil servants
every move I make.

292
00:36:21,139 --> 00:36:22,599
I need total control.

293
00:36:22,807 --> 00:36:25,268
Yeah, okay, I will...

294
00:36:25,477 --> 00:36:28,897
I will take care of that.

295
00:36:31,649 --> 00:36:34,361
Personally.

296
00:37:56,568 --> 00:37:59,029
Hello, Timer.

297
00:37:59,237 --> 00:38:02,323
Having a good day?

298
00:38:06,578 --> 00:38:10,790
Here you go.
Knock yourself out.

299
00:38:43,948 --> 00:38:46,493
I saw it on the news.

300
00:38:46,701 --> 00:38:48,536
You got the first one.

301
00:38:48,745 --> 00:38:50,830
Thank you.

302
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:52,123
Thank you.

303
00:38:52,332 --> 00:38:56,086
Well, I'm just doin' my job.
You gotta stay away from the other two.

304
00:38:56,294 --> 00:38:57,087
I could help you.

305
00:38:57,295 --> 00:38:58,505
I could...

306
00:38:58,713 --> 00:38:59,756
...set them up for you.

307
00:38:59,964 --> 00:39:03,176
No, you stay clear.

308
00:39:03,301 --> 00:39:06,429
The future is about
to become very dark.

309
00:39:06,638 --> 00:39:09,015
You're still following me.

310
00:39:09,224 --> 00:39:11,726
Aren't you?

311
00:39:12,435 --> 00:39:13,937
It's gotten so I can feel you.

312
00:39:14,145 --> 00:39:16,648
It's all part of the work.

313
00:39:16,856 --> 00:39:18,149
Do you think about me?

314
00:39:18,358 --> 00:39:20,485
I think about you.

315
00:39:20,694 --> 00:39:23,613
My own personal ghost.

316
00:39:23,822 --> 00:39:25,949
Or angel maybe.

317
00:39:26,157 --> 00:39:29,077
- We could meet.
- You're a beautiful woman.

318
00:39:29,285 --> 00:39:30,537
But, I don't meet.

319
00:39:30,745 --> 00:39:35,250
- When this is over, I should leave.
- When are you gonna do it?

320
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:36,543
Soon.

321
00:39:36,751 --> 00:39:39,462
Very soon.

322
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:46,803
Trent, you know the Chief of Police.

323
00:39:47,012 --> 00:39:50,473
Trent is going to work with us
on this problem.

324
00:39:50,682 --> 00:39:53,977
He was a former employee of the...

325
00:39:54,185 --> 00:39:55,562
...CIA.

326
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:59,941
He is an explosive expert,
and I think he can be a big help.

327
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,109
I don't know.

328
00:40:01,317 --> 00:40:05,947
This has become very public.
I'm sure you want a low profile.

329
00:40:06,156 --> 00:40:07,991
Yeah, please.

330
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:11,870
It would be hard for Ned
to go unnoticed.

331
00:40:12,078 --> 00:40:17,292
I think there's more involved here
than keeping a low profile.

332
00:40:18,501 --> 00:40:22,881
I'd say that I'm the one you can trust,
which is the main word here... trust.

333
00:40:23,089 --> 00:40:24,591
To take him out clean.

334
00:40:24,799 --> 00:40:26,634
Our bomb boys are the best.

335
00:40:26,843 --> 00:40:29,721
I hope that's true.
They better be fucking magicians...

336
00:40:29,929 --> 00:40:31,973
...because this man's impressive.

337
00:40:32,182 --> 00:40:34,017
What are you, a fucking fan?

338
00:40:34,225 --> 00:40:37,020
Come on! Stop that,
this is serious, right?

339
00:40:37,228 --> 00:40:39,314
Don't you two start!

340
00:40:39,522 --> 00:40:43,026
We're here to find a way to protect
the business. Don't forget that.

341
00:40:43,234 --> 00:40:46,529
Is that understood?

342
00:40:47,906 --> 00:40:49,532
I must tell you...

343
00:40:49,741 --> 00:40:51,743
...that this one is not negotiable.

344
00:40:51,951 --> 00:40:55,830
I'll do what I can.
Put him on as a fed.

345
00:41:03,213 --> 00:41:05,590
Chief, always a pleasure.

346
00:41:05,799 --> 00:41:09,260
Good to see you again.

347
00:41:11,554 --> 00:41:15,350
Okay, Danny, help me up.

348
00:41:15,767 --> 00:41:19,562
Oh, boy. I hate that deep couch.

349
00:41:20,105 --> 00:41:24,317
Now, listen.
Danny, you'll do me a favor.

350
00:41:24,526 --> 00:41:27,779
Do your best to make
this thing look official.

351
00:41:27,987 --> 00:41:31,032
No, please. You do that,
and I promise you...

352
00:41:31,241 --> 00:41:34,619
...I will not forget you.

353
00:41:40,458 --> 00:41:43,712
A man's got to eat.

354
00:41:48,967 --> 00:41:51,970
Idiota.

355
00:42:04,399 --> 00:42:07,986
Where's the bomb squad?

356
00:42:17,495 --> 00:42:20,957
Come on, boys and girls,
what are we doing? Look alive.

357
00:42:21,166 --> 00:42:22,834
What you got?

358
00:42:23,043 --> 00:42:27,714
We're doing a complete background
check on everybody at the party.

359
00:42:27,922 --> 00:42:30,800
Give me the next one.

360
00:42:40,268 --> 00:42:46,441
Listen, I'll handle the biographies.
You trace the C-4. Okay, Ace?

361
00:42:47,567 --> 00:42:50,653
Chief says you're on this. Fine.

362
00:42:50,862 --> 00:42:53,823
But I don't take orders
from any ex-anything.

363
00:42:54,032 --> 00:42:56,576
Okay, Ace?

364
00:42:56,576 --> 00:42:59,829
I must tell you. I'm sorry,
I thought your chief said...

365
00:43:00,038 --> 00:43:02,916
...the fullest cooperation
would be forthcoming.

366
00:43:03,124 --> 00:43:04,834
I must tell you something.

367
00:43:05,043 --> 00:43:07,671
This doesn't feel like full cooperation.

368
00:43:07,879 --> 00:43:10,215
Look at this shit. What is this?
This is, uh...

369
00:43:10,423 --> 00:43:12,092
Shouldn't this be in the lock-up?

370
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:13,468
I mean, I don't know.
Maybe I'm wrong.

371
00:43:13,677 --> 00:43:16,471
You guys are the experts.
Maybe you don't need me.

372
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,933
I mean, like what is this?
This is...

373
00:43:20,975 --> 00:43:22,018
This is Semtex.

374
00:43:22,227 --> 00:43:24,354
Am I right? Plastique, correct?

375
00:43:24,562 --> 00:43:25,355
Plastic explosive.

376
00:43:25,563 --> 00:43:27,357
Am I right? You're the expert.

377
00:43:27,565 --> 00:43:30,902
This could blow up this whole area,
and if this area goes...

378
00:43:31,111 --> 00:43:33,363
...the whole building could go up.

379
00:43:33,571 --> 00:43:35,699
Am I right? I don't know.

380
00:43:35,907 --> 00:43:39,494
Maybe if I put this in here...

381
00:43:40,036 --> 00:43:41,705
What else do we have here?

382
00:43:41,913 --> 00:43:46,376
This is a plunger detonator, right?
And that's a little mini-receiver.

383
00:43:46,584 --> 00:43:50,130
This looks like American circuitry
to me. Call me a patriot...

384
00:43:50,338 --> 00:43:54,050
...but American craftsmanship
is the greatest.

385
00:43:54,259 --> 00:43:55,385
Watch.

386
00:43:55,593 --> 00:43:57,345
Here we go.

387
00:43:57,554 --> 00:44:00,140
Let's see.

388
00:44:00,432 --> 00:44:02,726
Perfect fit, first time...

389
00:44:02,934 --> 00:44:04,894
...every time. Screw it on.

390
00:44:05,103 --> 00:44:07,063
One little twist.

391
00:44:07,272 --> 00:44:08,231
And, voilá.

392
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,942
A perfect receiver bomb.

393
00:44:11,151 --> 00:44:12,485
Which of course is...

394
00:44:12,694 --> 00:44:16,406
...absolutely worthless without a...

395
00:44:16,406 --> 00:44:19,367
...transmitter.

396
00:44:26,041 --> 00:44:27,375
Twenty seconds, and...

397
00:44:27,584 --> 00:44:29,961
...we're hot.

398
00:44:31,087 --> 00:44:33,923
Deactivate it, you sanctimonious prick!

399
00:44:34,132 --> 00:44:37,093
Cut that shit!

400
00:44:37,677 --> 00:44:39,012
Okay, you made your point!

401
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:41,139
Have I?

402
00:44:41,348 --> 00:44:43,266
- That's enough!
- What do you mean?

403
00:44:43,475 --> 00:44:45,435
You think I give a shit
if this whole fuckin' block goes up?!

404
00:44:45,643 --> 00:44:46,394
I don't!

405
00:44:46,603 --> 00:44:48,313
You've had enough.
Is that what you're saying?

406
00:44:48,521 --> 00:44:51,941
Yes, enough is enough!

407
00:44:52,192 --> 00:44:53,818
- I can't do it.
- Twelve.

408
00:44:54,027 --> 00:44:56,363
What the hell, are you crazy?

409
00:44:56,571 --> 00:45:00,116
I'm the craziest person
you'll ever meet in your life.

410
00:45:00,325 --> 00:45:01,409
Six.

411
00:45:01,618 --> 00:45:03,286
Five.

412
00:45:03,495 --> 00:45:04,954
Four.

413
00:45:05,163 --> 00:45:08,166
- Three.
- Please!

414
00:45:16,341 --> 00:45:17,884
Now, here's a tip...

415
00:45:18,093 --> 00:45:20,595
...you take care of the shit work.

416
00:45:20,804 --> 00:45:24,391
And leave the fox at the party to me.
Okay?

417
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:27,769
We on the same page?

418
00:45:29,521 --> 00:45:32,107
Ace?

419
00:46:10,562 --> 00:46:12,647
Do you like it? Those go upstairs.

420
00:46:12,856 --> 00:46:15,984
I like where I live.

421
00:46:16,192 --> 00:46:18,486
I like you where I live.

422
00:46:18,695 --> 00:46:20,655
Thanks.

423
00:46:20,864 --> 00:46:24,159
Close the doors. Leave.

424
00:46:37,255 --> 00:46:38,965
Better than what you're used to?

425
00:46:39,174 --> 00:46:45,138
Next time you order a hit you might
consider taking out your decorator.

426
00:46:48,767 --> 00:46:51,227
You like to live dangerously?

427
00:46:51,436 --> 00:46:53,688
A little danger never killed anyone.

428
00:46:53,897 --> 00:46:56,483
Right, baby?

429
00:46:56,691 --> 00:46:59,819
Sometimes.

430
00:47:12,457 --> 00:47:14,125
You know...

431
00:47:14,334 --> 00:47:17,587
...when I look at you...

432
00:47:17,629 --> 00:47:21,841
...I see something I like very much.

433
00:47:21,925 --> 00:47:23,259
Know what it is?

434
00:47:23,468 --> 00:47:27,263
I'm breathless with anticipation.

435
00:47:27,305 --> 00:47:30,350
I see me.

436
00:47:41,653 --> 00:47:44,406
Let's get this over with.

437
00:48:05,343 --> 00:48:07,679
Wait a minute.

438
00:48:07,887 --> 00:48:10,223
You're the mob's accountant, Bill.

439
00:48:10,432 --> 00:48:12,350
Is that all you've got for me?

440
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:16,104
No. I have something else for you.

441
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:23,194
See you later.

442
00:48:23,403 --> 00:48:27,991
Don't touch that!
It could be a bomb!

443
00:48:29,534 --> 00:48:32,287
Very funny.

444
00:49:42,732 --> 00:49:45,944
Son of a bitch!

445
00:50:01,835 --> 00:50:04,170
Kid!

446
00:50:05,463 --> 00:50:08,758
Look at the way you parked
my fucking car.

447
00:50:08,925 --> 00:50:12,887
Sir, I didn't park your car.

448
00:50:13,805 --> 00:50:15,348
Sorry.

449
00:50:15,557 --> 00:50:18,476
I'll get it for you.

450
00:50:54,596 --> 00:50:57,557
Here's your tip.

451
00:52:33,153 --> 00:52:36,281
Some ride that must have been.

452
00:52:36,489 --> 00:52:38,700
Is this the decoy?

453
00:52:38,908 --> 00:52:42,328
Who the fuck was this
supposed to fool?

454
00:52:43,246 --> 00:52:46,124
Any witnesses?

455
00:52:46,458 --> 00:52:49,127
The kid?

456
00:52:52,255 --> 00:52:54,591
Nice one, Ray.

457
00:52:54,799 --> 00:52:57,594
Clever boy.

458
00:53:05,185 --> 00:53:07,729
"Bye-bye."

459
00:53:07,937 --> 00:53:11,733
At least he hasn't lost
his sense of humor.

460
00:53:15,862 --> 00:53:18,073
Who gave you permission to smile?

461
00:53:18,281 --> 00:53:21,159
Shut up.

462
00:53:43,848 --> 00:53:46,059
Quite a step up for you, isn't it?

463
00:53:46,267 --> 00:53:49,437
Depends on how you look at it.

464
00:53:49,646 --> 00:53:52,315
- Tomas is on his way...
- Shut up!

465
00:53:52,524 --> 00:53:54,734
Who are you?

466
00:53:54,943 --> 00:53:57,320
I said, "Who are you?"

467
00:53:57,529 --> 00:53:58,530
Who are you?

468
00:53:58,738 --> 00:53:59,989
I'll tell you who you are.

469
00:54:00,198 --> 00:54:01,825
You are nobody.

470
00:54:02,033 --> 00:54:03,618
I created Adrian Hastings.

471
00:54:03,827 --> 00:54:05,328
I got you inside.

472
00:54:05,537 --> 00:54:09,791
You work for me.
Don't you ever fucking forget it.

473
00:54:10,834 --> 00:54:12,669
You should have him
out in the open by now.

474
00:54:12,877 --> 00:54:15,630
You get your three corpses,
I get Ray Quick.

475
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:18,383
That was the deal. What happened?

476
00:54:18,591 --> 00:54:21,344
I can't keep him on the line
long enough to get a trace.

477
00:54:21,553 --> 00:54:23,722
He doesn't want to take a meeting.

478
00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:26,599
What should I do?
Wish him out of hiding?

479
00:54:26,808 --> 00:54:28,643
You're in over your head.

480
00:54:28,852 --> 00:54:31,980
Maybe you've outlived your usefulness.
Is that possible?

481
00:54:32,188 --> 00:54:34,024
You need me.

482
00:54:34,232 --> 00:54:38,111
I studied him, I drew him out.

483
00:54:38,236 --> 00:54:42,407
With my voice, with my ads.
He trusts me.

484
00:54:42,615 --> 00:54:44,451
Why do I need you?

485
00:54:44,659 --> 00:54:47,912
Why don't I just grab him
before he brings Tomas down?

486
00:54:48,121 --> 00:54:49,873
Why do you even need...

487
00:54:50,081 --> 00:54:51,750
...to live at all?

488
00:54:51,958 --> 00:54:56,755
Maybe he's not interested in
a big-mouth, hotshot asshole like you.

489
00:54:58,965 --> 00:55:03,053
You know what I love about you?

490
00:55:03,303 --> 00:55:04,929
It's not just this...

491
00:55:05,138 --> 00:55:07,807
...poetry.

492
00:55:08,892 --> 00:55:11,061
It's your heart.

493
00:55:11,269 --> 00:55:14,606
It's the heart you bring to your work.

494
00:55:14,814 --> 00:55:19,069
But if you don't set up a meeting with
him before he drops the third target...

495
00:55:19,277 --> 00:55:21,738
...you'll pray for a lifetime
of Tomas's attentions...

496
00:55:21,946 --> 00:55:24,616
...his delicate touch.

497
00:55:24,824 --> 00:55:27,035
- I promise.
- Don't touch me.

498
00:55:27,243 --> 00:55:29,746
I'm sorry.

499
00:55:32,415 --> 00:55:35,627
I've always wondered...

500
00:55:35,835 --> 00:55:38,713
...what was it like...

501
00:55:39,005 --> 00:55:41,132
...after you watched your parents die.

502
00:55:41,341 --> 00:55:44,386
Did you go over to the bed?

503
00:55:44,427 --> 00:55:47,722
Did little May hug them?

504
00:55:47,931 --> 00:55:51,518
Did you try to shake them awake?

505
00:55:51,976 --> 00:55:53,436
How much blood?

506
00:55:53,645 --> 00:55:56,773
I'm just curious, was there...

507
00:55:57,023 --> 00:55:58,900
...a lot of blood?

508
00:55:59,109 --> 00:56:01,903
Don't push me.

509
00:56:19,004 --> 00:56:20,255
What're you doing here?

510
00:56:20,463 --> 00:56:22,465
Take it easy, hotshot.

511
00:56:22,674 --> 00:56:24,467
I'm checking on you.

512
00:56:24,676 --> 00:56:28,138
I don't need you goddamn
baby-sitting for me.

513
00:56:28,346 --> 00:56:31,474
Why don't you look for who's hitting us?

514
00:56:31,683 --> 00:56:32,809
What's the first move?

515
00:56:33,018 --> 00:56:34,561
Door-to-door search?

516
00:56:34,769 --> 00:56:37,188
I'm sick of you.

517
00:56:37,397 --> 00:56:39,774
My father thinks he needs you.

518
00:56:39,983 --> 00:56:41,985
When he finds out he doesn't...

519
00:56:42,193 --> 00:56:44,779
...you're mine.

520
00:56:46,406 --> 00:56:47,282
I feel threatened.

521
00:56:47,490 --> 00:56:50,577
You are threatened.

522
00:58:17,914 --> 00:58:20,625
Five hundred.

523
00:58:30,135 --> 00:58:32,512
Okay, I'm out of here.

524
00:59:37,202 --> 00:59:39,829
Just a second.

525
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:44,626
May Munro.

526
00:59:55,053 --> 00:59:55,720
Get in!

527
00:59:55,929 --> 00:59:57,138
Get up!

528
00:59:57,347 --> 01:00:01,685
Go in there! Get him!
Get the fuck in there!

529
01:00:04,062 --> 01:00:06,856
Keep them back.

530
01:00:08,566 --> 01:00:11,486
Get them out!

531
01:00:13,279 --> 01:00:15,782
Fuck!

532
01:00:17,617 --> 01:00:19,703
Good one, Ray.

533
01:00:19,911 --> 01:00:23,039
Really good.

534
01:01:08,001 --> 01:01:11,463
Joe, I am so sorry.

535
01:01:19,679 --> 01:01:22,807
You're sorry?

536
01:01:24,309 --> 01:01:27,187
My son...

537
01:01:28,063 --> 01:01:31,566
...is in a closed casket...

538
01:01:32,317 --> 01:01:34,110
...and...

539
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:37,906
...you are sorry.

540
01:01:39,074 --> 01:01:41,242
I hold you responsible.

541
01:01:41,451 --> 01:01:42,952
He wouldn't lay low.

542
01:01:43,161 --> 01:01:46,206
What'd you say?

543
01:01:47,665 --> 01:01:49,959
I said, "He wouldn't lay low".

544
01:01:50,168 --> 01:01:54,005
Are you trying to tell me
that was his fault now?

545
01:01:54,214 --> 01:01:55,048
That's how it was.

546
01:01:55,256 --> 01:01:58,968
The way it was! You were supposed
to protect his back!

547
01:01:59,177 --> 01:02:01,054
His life was in your hands!

548
01:02:01,262 --> 01:02:03,014
You know what you do?!

549
01:02:03,223 --> 01:02:06,476
You cut my heart out, you know.

550
01:02:06,685 --> 01:02:10,230
And now you look, my...

551
01:02:11,815 --> 01:02:14,359
...my son...

552
01:02:14,567 --> 01:02:17,487
...is lying in a box.

553
01:02:17,696 --> 01:02:18,613
You know...

554
01:02:18,822 --> 01:02:20,990
...you were the one...

555
01:02:21,199 --> 01:02:22,492
...who let it happen.

556
01:02:22,701 --> 01:02:24,536
You're not thinking straight.

557
01:02:24,744 --> 01:02:26,913
Jesus Christ, don't you try to tell me.

558
01:02:27,122 --> 01:02:28,957
I swear to God, don't say another word.

559
01:02:29,165 --> 01:02:31,209
Not another word or I'll kill you here.

560
01:02:31,418 --> 01:02:34,295
You understand?

561
01:02:43,847 --> 01:02:46,016
Now...

562
01:02:48,810 --> 01:02:51,813
...you go out...

563
01:02:52,063 --> 01:02:56,192
...you go out and you find
this explosive expert...

564
01:02:56,401 --> 01:02:58,194
...and you...

565
01:02:58,403 --> 01:03:01,156
...bring him to me alive...

566
01:03:01,364 --> 01:03:04,993
...before I bury Tomas.

567
01:04:25,323 --> 01:04:27,492
"Adrian Hastings of Miami,
Dade County."

568
01:04:27,701 --> 01:04:33,623
"Services 3:00 p.m., Friday
at San Juan De Boneo."

569
01:04:36,459 --> 01:04:39,921
Her body's in cold storage
at County General.

570
01:04:42,674 --> 01:04:43,717
How does this sound?

571
01:04:43,925 --> 01:04:47,470
"Lonely, needy, deeply hurt.
Will be discreet."

572
01:04:47,679 --> 01:04:51,224
Story of my life.

573
01:04:52,183 --> 01:04:54,728
Get this on every major
bulletin board service.

574
01:04:54,936 --> 01:04:58,398
Put the response number through
long-distance and be ready to trace.

575
01:04:58,606 --> 01:05:00,984
Okay?

576
01:05:32,891 --> 01:05:36,686
Guys like this, they won't advertise.
You must draw them out.

577
01:05:36,895 --> 01:05:39,856
Do your best.

578
01:05:40,732 --> 01:05:44,527
Hi, baby! Are you wearing
any underwear?

579
01:05:44,736 --> 01:05:46,237
Get rid of him.

580
01:05:46,446 --> 01:05:48,782
Your experience doesn't match my needs.

581
01:05:48,990 --> 01:05:52,535
- Get rid of him.
- I am.

582
01:05:52,744 --> 01:05:54,537
Thirty calls and nothing.

583
01:05:54,746 --> 01:05:56,373
I don't know if this makes sense.

584
01:05:56,581 --> 01:05:59,376
I'll decide if it makes
any sense or not, okay?

585
01:05:59,584 --> 01:06:01,086
Go on, take it. Take it!

586
01:06:01,294 --> 01:06:04,089
Line five and...

587
01:06:04,297 --> 01:06:04,839
Go.

588
01:06:05,048 --> 01:06:06,383
Hello?

589
01:06:06,591 --> 01:06:10,303
Calling about the ad, right?

590
01:06:10,929 --> 01:06:13,473
Yeah.

591
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:15,558
Right.

592
01:06:15,767 --> 01:06:18,728
I thought you were someone else.

593
01:06:18,728 --> 01:06:21,231
The ad was similar to others.

594
01:06:21,439 --> 01:06:24,401
Give me a number.
I can't talk on this phone.

595
01:06:24,609 --> 01:06:25,735
Forget it.

596
01:06:25,944 --> 01:06:28,196
You have a message from May.

597
01:06:28,405 --> 01:06:30,407
I've got a message...

598
01:06:30,615 --> 01:06:33,243
...from May.

599
01:06:33,451 --> 01:06:35,578
- Who is this?
- She's okay.

600
01:06:35,787 --> 01:06:37,747
She wants to meet you.

601
01:06:37,956 --> 01:06:41,126
No, I don't think so.

602
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:45,463
Put Trent on the line.

603
01:06:45,672 --> 01:06:47,090
What did you say?

604
01:06:47,298 --> 01:06:51,511
Trent. He's standing next to you.
I want to talk to him.

605
01:06:51,970 --> 01:06:54,764
Put him on the line!

606
01:06:56,391 --> 01:06:59,394
Ned, can you hear me?

607
01:06:59,561 --> 01:07:01,771
Talk to me. Talk to me, Ned.

608
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:06,776
Your playmates know what kind of man
you are? Why the Agency fired you?

609
01:07:06,985 --> 01:07:10,113
That killing people
was like jerking off for you?

610
01:07:10,321 --> 01:07:13,575
Watching those bloody bodies
going though the air gets you off.

611
01:07:13,783 --> 01:07:18,163
Talk to me. When you crawl
into your hole at night alone...

612
01:07:18,371 --> 01:07:22,876
...and you are alone, aren't you?
Tell me what burns you the most.

613
01:07:23,084 --> 01:07:25,754
Losing your job as a CIA attack dog...

614
01:07:25,962 --> 01:07:29,466
...or knowing that I turned you in
and I'm still alive?

615
01:07:29,674 --> 01:07:31,468
Talk to me!

616
01:07:31,676 --> 01:07:33,803
You'll sell your service
to the highest bidder!

617
01:07:34,012 --> 01:07:35,305
You stinking nugget!

618
01:07:35,513 --> 01:07:39,392
Fuck you, Ray! Fuck you!
You killed!

619
01:07:39,601 --> 01:07:40,894
Your bombs!

620
01:07:41,102 --> 01:07:44,814
How many? 10, 50, 100,
before you lost count?

621
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:49,194
It was your bombs on the bridge
in Bogota! Your bomb in the cabana!

622
01:07:49,402 --> 01:07:52,489
But you're getting sloppy.
You broke your code.

623
01:07:52,697 --> 01:07:54,491
You killed an innocent bystander.

624
01:07:54,699 --> 01:07:57,327
It is eating you up inside, isn't it?

625
01:07:57,535 --> 01:08:00,663
You were always too sensitive.
But guess what?

626
01:08:00,872 --> 01:08:03,667
I'm coming to take all the pain away.

627
01:08:03,875 --> 01:08:08,171
I'll fucking cut it right out of you,
and close your heart in my hand.

628
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:11,383
I'm right behind you! I know you!

629
01:08:11,424 --> 01:08:15,595
You've got no mercy.
You got no fucking loyalty.

630
01:08:15,804 --> 01:08:17,305
And you got no code.

631
01:08:17,514 --> 01:08:21,893
- Listen to me, you son of a bitch!
- Time's up, 58 seconds.

632
01:08:25,397 --> 01:08:26,356
God damn it!

633
01:08:26,564 --> 01:08:27,482
Son of a bitch!

634
01:08:27,691 --> 01:08:30,235
I'll fucking kill you!
I'll vaporize your ass!

635
01:08:30,443 --> 01:08:33,446
What're you looking at?

636
01:08:35,490 --> 01:08:38,326
Turn around!

637
01:08:44,124 --> 01:08:45,583
Nobody...

638
01:08:45,792 --> 01:08:49,004
...says a word.

639
01:08:49,754 --> 01:08:52,298
Tell me that you got a trace.

640
01:08:52,507 --> 01:08:53,925
Just tell me.

641
01:08:54,134 --> 01:08:56,594
He jumped off before we locked him.

642
01:08:56,803 --> 01:09:00,890
- We got a partial trace.
- Shut up.

643
01:09:25,623 --> 01:09:28,668
She gave of herself...

644
01:09:28,877 --> 01:09:30,545
...for 40 years.

645
01:09:30,754 --> 01:09:33,423
She dedicated her life...

646
01:09:33,631 --> 01:09:35,050
...generously...

647
01:09:35,258 --> 01:09:37,510
...courageously...

648
01:09:37,719 --> 01:09:42,223
...to all of us, Cuban orphans
everywhere.

649
01:09:42,891 --> 01:09:45,393
She has shown us a road.

650
01:09:45,602 --> 01:09:49,272
For the wages sin pays is death.

651
01:09:49,481 --> 01:09:51,775
But the gift God gives...

652
01:09:51,983 --> 01:09:53,777
...is everlasting life...

653
01:09:53,985 --> 01:09:57,697
...by Christ, Jesus Our Lord.

654
01:11:00,093 --> 01:11:03,096
How did I look?

655
01:11:39,799 --> 01:11:41,843
Why did you do this?

656
01:11:42,052 --> 01:11:45,430
I wanted to meet you.

657
01:11:46,598 --> 01:11:49,684
I wanted to know if you were
everything I ever thought.

658
01:11:49,893 --> 01:11:53,104
Nobody ever is.

659
01:12:17,295 --> 01:12:20,173
Hold it.

660
01:12:21,174 --> 01:12:22,550
Open the casket.

661
01:12:22,759 --> 01:12:23,760
Who are you?

662
01:12:23,968 --> 01:12:27,889
I said, open the fucking casket!

663
01:12:36,648 --> 01:12:37,774
Bitch!

664
01:12:37,982 --> 01:12:40,568
Fuck!

665
01:13:12,392 --> 01:13:14,477
We shouldn't be here.

666
01:13:14,686 --> 01:13:16,813
Not if we want to stay alive.

667
01:13:17,022 --> 01:13:18,815
Is it worth it?

668
01:13:19,024 --> 01:13:21,818
I think so.

669
01:13:25,030 --> 01:13:28,199
I hope so.

670
01:13:48,845 --> 01:13:52,265
Let me see this beautiful face.

671
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:10,779
Why'd you let me think I killed you?

672
01:16:10,987 --> 01:16:13,907
I thought it was the only way
I could get Tomas's men off my back.

673
01:16:14,115 --> 01:16:15,825
Give me some details.

674
01:16:16,034 --> 01:16:20,455
Poor lady O.D.'d in the emergency room.

675
01:16:20,955 --> 01:16:22,707
I dropped my wallet in her purse...

676
01:16:22,916 --> 01:16:25,960
...and here I am.

677
01:16:27,045 --> 01:16:29,381
Pretty good, especially...

678
01:16:29,589 --> 01:16:32,967
...if you're really an amateur.

679
01:16:34,386 --> 01:16:37,055
You could've been killed.

680
01:16:37,263 --> 01:16:39,683
I had to be there when he died.

681
01:16:39,891 --> 01:16:42,644
I needed to see it.

682
01:16:44,688 --> 01:16:47,649
Anyway...

683
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:52,195
I knew you'd choose
the safest way for everybody.

684
01:16:52,404 --> 01:16:55,824
I studied your style.

685
01:16:56,408 --> 01:17:00,120
I knew you always focused
your detonation.

686
01:17:02,455 --> 01:17:04,499
So I knew...

687
01:17:04,708 --> 01:17:09,754
...as long as I was facing Tomas,
right in front of him, like this...

688
01:17:10,714 --> 01:17:14,551
Even closer, like this...

689
01:17:17,721 --> 01:17:20,849
...I know I feel safe.

690
01:17:29,691 --> 01:17:30,734
Excuse me.

691
01:17:30,942 --> 01:17:33,361
Police is looking for these two.

692
01:17:33,570 --> 01:17:37,073
If you see them,
call the number on the back.

693
01:17:37,282 --> 01:17:38,742
Wait.

694
01:17:38,950 --> 01:17:41,953
I have seen them.

695
01:18:26,331 --> 01:18:28,458
Back from the dead.

696
01:18:28,667 --> 01:18:29,876
Jesus.

697
01:18:30,085 --> 01:18:31,544
Thank God.

698
01:18:31,753 --> 01:18:34,130
I was just going to call you.

699
01:18:34,339 --> 01:18:37,801
About the funeral thing,
I'm sorry, there's just...

700
01:18:38,009 --> 01:18:40,136
It was the only way to draw him out.

701
01:18:40,345 --> 01:18:41,805
It worked. I don't have to tell you.

702
01:18:42,013 --> 01:18:45,600
I used the attachment thing,
and I got him.

703
01:18:45,809 --> 01:18:47,602
Couldn't stay away from me.

704
01:18:47,811 --> 01:18:48,812
So?

705
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:51,564
I just want to get one thing straight.

706
01:18:51,773 --> 01:18:56,069
You did all this to deliver him to me?

707
01:18:56,653 --> 01:18:59,823
We had a deal.
I hold up my end of the deal.

708
01:19:00,031 --> 01:19:01,991
You are classic, May.

709
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:03,451
Where is he?

710
01:19:03,660 --> 01:19:04,577
- Here!
- Where?

711
01:19:04,786 --> 01:19:06,496
- In the hotel.
- I know. Where?

712
01:19:06,705 --> 01:19:10,125
I got a key. I think it...

713
01:19:13,044 --> 01:19:15,046
This key?

714
01:19:15,255 --> 01:19:17,173
I mean, I do have a key.

715
01:19:17,382 --> 01:19:21,219
- He's on a high floor, it's 10 or 11.
- Take her to the car.

716
01:19:21,428 --> 01:19:23,513
- Go on.
- I left my purse, I have to...

717
01:19:23,722 --> 01:19:26,599
- Shut up. Take her to the car.
- I have a couple of things to do.

718
01:19:26,808 --> 01:19:30,603
Stop yanking me around!

719
01:19:37,068 --> 01:19:40,155
He made me so nervous.
It'll take me one second.

720
01:19:40,363 --> 01:19:43,533
Where can I go?

721
01:19:48,538 --> 01:19:50,915
Harry, listen...

722
01:19:51,124 --> 01:19:54,336
Harry, she'll call you back.

723
01:19:55,128 --> 01:19:57,839
Give me my phone!

724
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:03,303
Room 1205.

725
01:20:15,148 --> 01:20:16,900
León's men are on their way up.

726
01:20:17,108 --> 01:20:18,651
You set me up.

727
01:20:18,860 --> 01:20:21,780
- Why?
- I did not.

728
01:20:40,799 --> 01:20:42,133
Hit it. Let's get out.

729
01:20:42,342 --> 01:20:45,929
There's a fire. Let's go. Rush.

730
01:20:47,138 --> 01:20:52,185
Where you going? Use the stairs.
This one's full. Get out of here!

731
01:21:31,474 --> 01:21:34,310
We're sorry. Your call
cannot be completed as dialed.

732
01:21:34,519 --> 01:21:39,190
Please check the number and
dial again or call the operator.

733
01:21:45,530 --> 01:21:50,285
If you have to make a call,
please hang up and try again...

734
01:22:21,399 --> 01:22:22,400
Don't move!

735
01:22:22,609 --> 01:22:25,945
Don't touch anything!

736
01:22:35,622 --> 01:22:38,083
Give me your hand!

737
01:22:59,020 --> 01:23:01,898
Holy shit!

738
01:23:09,572 --> 01:23:12,325
Go! Go!

739
01:23:20,834 --> 01:23:24,421
Hey, what's with the lights here?

740
01:23:56,870 --> 01:24:00,790
Come on, asshole! Come on!

741
01:24:33,907 --> 01:24:38,370
There has been an accident,
but there is no danger.

742
01:25:05,980 --> 01:25:07,857
That's her.

743
01:25:08,066 --> 01:25:09,275
Her who?

744
01:25:09,484 --> 01:25:11,528
That's the bitch who was banging Tomas.

745
01:25:11,736 --> 01:25:16,157
Her ID was faked.
Ray Quick is working for her.

746
01:25:18,952 --> 01:25:19,869
Alice...

747
01:25:20,078 --> 01:25:22,831
...and Stan Munro.

748
01:25:23,039 --> 01:25:25,542
What are you talking about?

749
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:30,547
I was the kid your little boy
missed in the closet.

750
01:25:34,509 --> 01:25:35,885
That was a long time ago.

751
01:25:36,094 --> 01:25:38,638
Not to me.

752
01:25:38,847 --> 01:25:40,724
Now I understand.

753
01:25:40,932 --> 01:25:43,268
Now I understand. You...

754
01:25:43,476 --> 01:25:45,562
You think...

755
01:25:45,770 --> 01:25:50,650
...that my son Tomas gave the orders
for the killings. Well, you are wrong.

756
01:25:50,859 --> 01:25:55,822
If anybody in this house has power
to give orders, it's me.

757
01:25:56,031 --> 01:25:58,241
Understand? I give the orders.

758
01:25:58,450 --> 01:26:00,660
I give the orders of who is killed...

759
01:26:00,869 --> 01:26:05,457
...and who is not killed.
Is that understood?

760
01:26:05,749 --> 01:26:07,459
I need her...

761
01:26:07,667 --> 01:26:08,793
...to get to Ray.

762
01:26:09,002 --> 01:26:11,296
I must make one phone call,
then she's yours.

763
01:26:11,504 --> 01:26:12,797
But I need her now.

764
01:26:13,006 --> 01:26:15,425
You sure?

765
01:26:15,633 --> 01:26:18,428
Joe, please.

766
01:26:22,265 --> 01:26:25,393
Take the bitch.

767
01:26:42,702 --> 01:26:45,413
Show time.

768
01:26:47,499 --> 01:26:49,417
It's me.

769
01:26:49,626 --> 01:26:52,712
I'm sorry. I didn't know
they were coming. Believe me.

770
01:26:52,921 --> 01:26:55,298
I'll tell you what I believe.

771
01:26:55,507 --> 01:26:58,510
I believe you're very good on the phone.

772
01:26:59,636 --> 01:27:01,930
I need to see you.

773
01:27:02,138 --> 01:27:04,307
And get set up again?

774
01:27:04,516 --> 01:27:06,810
No, I'll pass.

775
01:27:07,018 --> 01:27:08,478
I'm through taking risks.

776
01:27:08,687 --> 01:27:10,021
So that's it?

777
01:27:10,230 --> 01:27:11,940
We just walk away?

778
01:27:12,148 --> 01:27:13,316
Forever?

779
01:27:13,525 --> 01:27:16,653
It's safer for everybody.

780
01:27:18,613 --> 01:27:22,325
Come on, I don't know what
this relationship is about...

781
01:27:22,534 --> 01:27:24,869
...but there's one thing I know.
It's not based on safety.

782
01:27:25,078 --> 01:27:27,539
You're too much of an unknown.

783
01:27:27,747 --> 01:27:29,624
Adrian Hastings, May Munro.

784
01:27:29,833 --> 01:27:33,336
Who the hell are you?

785
01:27:34,087 --> 01:27:36,423
Remember the Fontainebleau?

786
01:27:36,631 --> 01:27:39,217
I remember.

787
01:27:40,051 --> 01:27:43,430
Remember touching me?

788
01:27:43,972 --> 01:27:47,017
Do you remember my voice?

789
01:27:47,225 --> 01:27:50,562
Not over the phone...

790
01:27:50,979 --> 01:27:54,441
...but carried on breath.

791
01:27:54,566 --> 01:27:57,027
On you.

792
01:27:57,235 --> 01:28:00,155
Near you.

793
01:28:01,197 --> 01:28:03,366
Close enough to feel.

794
01:28:03,575 --> 01:28:06,661
Why are you saying this to me?

795
01:28:06,661 --> 01:28:10,081
Because I have to.

796
01:28:10,665 --> 01:28:13,001
Come on, Ray.

797
01:28:13,209 --> 01:28:15,879
You gotta see me.

798
01:28:16,087 --> 01:28:18,465
Please.

799
01:28:18,673 --> 01:28:21,343
Please, baby.

800
01:28:30,018 --> 01:28:33,605
Double-M Seafood, right now.

801
01:28:33,813 --> 01:28:35,398
All right.

802
01:28:35,607 --> 01:28:36,941
And Ray...

803
01:28:37,150 --> 01:28:38,860
I'm here.

804
01:28:39,069 --> 01:28:41,905
Do you remember the note
our relationship ended on?

805
01:28:42,113 --> 01:28:44,949
The last thing I said to you?

806
01:28:45,158 --> 01:28:47,577
I remember everything.

807
01:28:47,786 --> 01:28:50,413
I meant every word.

808
01:29:12,769 --> 01:29:14,646
You're goin' in alone.

809
01:29:14,854 --> 01:29:16,606
And if this is a trap...

810
01:29:16,815 --> 01:29:19,776
...I promise you, you're gonna die.

811
01:29:19,984 --> 01:29:21,569
But if he's in there...

812
01:29:21,778 --> 01:29:26,116
...make him feel safe and secure.
And I'll be listening...

813
01:29:26,324 --> 01:29:28,243
...on this microphone.

814
01:29:28,451 --> 01:29:30,829
The second I hear his voice...

815
01:29:31,037 --> 01:29:31,705
...we move in.

816
01:29:31,913 --> 01:29:33,081
Understand?

817
01:29:33,289 --> 01:29:36,668
Now get out of the fucking car.

818
01:29:52,684 --> 01:29:54,019
When this is all over...

819
01:29:54,227 --> 01:29:56,980
...I can see us spending time together.

820
01:29:57,188 --> 01:29:59,774
You know, you wash...

821
01:29:59,983 --> 01:30:02,819
...the stink of Tomas and Ray off you...

822
01:30:03,028 --> 01:30:06,781
...you might clean up pretty good.

823
01:30:14,372 --> 01:30:16,666
Go ahead.

824
01:30:17,208 --> 01:30:19,502
And then you can go in
and get him yourself.

825
01:30:19,711 --> 01:30:22,797
I don't give a shit!

826
01:30:23,882 --> 01:30:26,593
Go on!

827
01:30:27,385 --> 01:30:30,263
Move!

828
01:30:37,312 --> 01:30:39,147
If she blinks...

829
01:30:39,356 --> 01:30:42,275
...kill her.

830
01:31:05,924 --> 01:31:08,051
Bad plan, Ned.

831
01:31:08,259 --> 01:31:11,763
That's it, we've got him. Move in.

832
01:31:16,309 --> 01:31:18,645
Damn it!

833
01:31:30,115 --> 01:31:32,701
Damn it!

834
01:31:33,993 --> 01:31:36,246
Go, you chicken shits!

835
01:31:36,454 --> 01:31:39,082
You think he'll top that?
Get in there!

836
01:31:39,290 --> 01:31:42,043
Watch the river and the side streets!

837
01:31:42,252 --> 01:31:43,378
Fucking crabs!

838
01:31:43,586 --> 01:31:46,214
Nice one.

839
01:31:49,884 --> 01:31:52,721
Watch the river!

840
01:32:16,161 --> 01:32:19,247
You want to set me up again?

841
01:32:19,456 --> 01:32:21,041
What's that?

842
01:32:21,249 --> 01:32:23,960
Break it down.

843
01:32:25,503 --> 01:32:28,423
Air brakes.

844
01:32:28,590 --> 01:32:31,634
Complex sound, slightly muffled.

845
01:32:31,843 --> 01:32:33,053
People talking...

846
01:32:33,261 --> 01:32:35,638
...clamping down steps.

847
01:32:35,847 --> 01:32:37,807
A clapping shut.

848
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:40,852
Voices... mechanical sounds.

849
01:32:41,061 --> 01:32:44,564
- A hiss!
- People getting off a bus!

850
01:32:44,856 --> 01:32:47,150
You must have an overview.
It's people getting off a bus.

851
01:32:47,359 --> 01:32:48,735
Are they on both tapes?

852
01:32:48,943 --> 01:32:54,324
I knew it! We gotta have bus routes.
What do we have?

853
01:32:54,366 --> 01:32:57,202
He uses pay phones,
but he gets there by bus.

854
01:32:57,410 --> 01:32:59,996
Oh, Ray, always so precise.

855
01:33:00,205 --> 01:33:03,208
Let's say, he gets on a bus
wherever he lives, and he...

856
01:33:03,416 --> 01:33:06,336
...goes in both directions.
Good counter-surveillance technique.

857
01:33:06,544 --> 01:33:11,758
He takes the bus 20, 25 minutes
in each direction. So we have...

858
01:33:12,133 --> 01:33:14,094
Four, four and four.

859
01:33:14,302 --> 01:33:16,221
Here we go, triangulation.

860
01:33:16,429 --> 01:33:20,975
Three routes, that's it.
We want checks in five-minute intervals.

861
01:33:21,184 --> 01:33:23,186
How about the restaurants?

862
01:33:23,395 --> 01:33:25,980
He must eat sometime.

863
01:33:26,189 --> 01:33:29,317
Try to remember. He'd have got off
the bus alone, maybe bought cigarettes.

864
01:33:29,526 --> 01:33:30,694
Look at that face!

865
01:33:30,902 --> 01:33:33,697
We have a lot of regular customers,
but he ain't one.

866
01:33:33,905 --> 01:33:35,865
Look at that face again!
Come on. Come on!

867
01:33:36,074 --> 01:33:38,368
Nothing.

868
01:33:38,576 --> 01:33:41,037
Hey, Henry!

869
01:33:41,913 --> 01:33:45,500
I forgot to tell you, we deliver.

870
01:34:04,019 --> 01:34:07,188
Now there's a vision.

871
01:34:11,067 --> 01:34:13,403
Good morning, stranger.

872
01:34:13,611 --> 01:34:15,238
I've got to go.

873
01:34:15,447 --> 01:34:19,909
Where? I think we already wore out
our welcome at the Hilton.

874
01:34:25,623 --> 01:34:28,960
I want to stay with you.

875
01:34:29,502 --> 01:34:33,923
But it's not over for me.
Joe León ordered the hit.

876
01:34:34,132 --> 01:34:37,093
Let me get this right.

877
01:34:37,761 --> 01:34:40,430
You think killing Joe
will make everything okay?

878
01:34:40,638 --> 01:34:43,683
Something has to.

879
01:34:45,310 --> 01:34:50,065
You did the job. I'm not asking
for your help. I'll do it. I owe him.

880
01:34:50,273 --> 01:34:51,858
No.

881
01:34:52,067 --> 01:34:54,861
You owe her.

882
01:34:56,654 --> 01:35:00,533
Her. A whole life. Come here.

883
01:35:00,658 --> 01:35:03,536
Come here.

884
01:35:10,669 --> 01:35:14,589
Put all this behind you now,
or the past will eat you alive.

885
01:35:14,798 --> 01:35:18,218
I know what I'm talking about.

886
01:35:21,137 --> 01:35:23,348
I have to go.

887
01:35:23,556 --> 01:35:26,518
Wish me luck.

888
01:35:36,194 --> 01:35:39,823
Come here. You're not going.

889
01:36:23,074 --> 01:36:26,286
Detonation sequence primed.
Enter code.

890
01:36:26,494 --> 01:36:29,080
Top of the world, Mom.

891
01:36:29,414 --> 01:36:30,957
Controlled!

892
01:36:31,166 --> 01:36:35,754
One... two... three...

893
01:36:42,385 --> 01:36:43,970
I'm afraid to ask.

894
01:36:44,179 --> 01:36:47,223
Explosions will occur
if the inner perimeter is breached.

895
01:36:47,432 --> 01:36:51,353
Each one of these lights is a pressure
mine. If one goes, they all go.

896
01:36:51,561 --> 01:36:53,480
- Where are they?
- Everywhere.

897
01:36:53,688 --> 01:36:58,151
Don't worry, they're not armed yet.
When these lights turn red... worry.

898
01:37:07,118 --> 01:37:08,703
This is good. Nice sneak attack!

899
01:37:08,912 --> 01:37:13,124
Do not approach the warehouse.
Perimeter is on.

900
01:37:13,249 --> 01:37:17,253
Please, cut the bullshit.

901
01:37:22,258 --> 01:37:26,012
That's a good one. I taught him that.

902
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:29,557
Nice sense of irony,
blowing up the bomb disposal unit.

903
01:37:29,766 --> 01:37:32,185
Nice work, Ray.

904
01:37:32,394 --> 01:37:33,436
WARNING!

905
01:37:33,645 --> 01:37:36,356
Gunfire will automatically
detonate B-20's...

906
01:37:36,564 --> 01:37:41,027
...sufficient to destroy
two square miles.

907
01:37:43,947 --> 01:37:46,700
Give me that.

908
01:37:47,242 --> 01:37:48,952
Listen up! Anybody shoots...

909
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:53,039
...anybody shoots, I shoot them!

910
01:37:53,289 --> 01:37:55,375
This whole place is wired and
I'm taking him alive.

911
01:37:55,583 --> 01:37:58,044
You got that?

912
01:38:08,388 --> 01:38:09,597
That's new.

913
01:38:09,806 --> 01:38:13,059
How's that feel, Ace?

914
01:38:15,729 --> 01:38:19,149
Fuck this amateur hour.

915
01:38:28,366 --> 01:38:31,119
You're crazy.

916
01:38:36,291 --> 01:38:40,337
All the highly trained professionals
of the world...

917
01:38:41,838 --> 01:38:44,424
...all the hardware...

918
01:38:44,632 --> 01:38:47,802
...all the technology,
and what have you got?

919
01:38:48,011 --> 01:38:50,180
Nothing.

920
01:38:50,388 --> 01:38:53,516
You gotta do everything yourself.

921
01:38:53,725 --> 01:38:56,478
And why?

922
01:38:56,728 --> 01:39:00,732
You can't get good help these days.

923
01:39:25,548 --> 01:39:28,927
A surprise for you, Ray.

924
01:39:31,012 --> 01:39:33,181
Warning! Perimeter breach.

925
01:39:33,390 --> 01:39:36,810
It's set. Let's go.

926
01:39:41,981 --> 01:39:43,274
Don't move!

927
01:39:43,483 --> 01:39:46,069
- I'll lead you through the mines.
- Evacuate!

928
01:39:46,277 --> 01:39:48,863
Ray...?

929
01:39:50,073 --> 01:39:53,326
I'm sorry. Should I have knocked?

930
01:39:57,706 --> 01:40:00,792
You lose, I win.

931
01:40:02,460 --> 01:40:05,380
She's hot, Ray.
Semtex, sprayed with nitro.

932
01:40:05,588 --> 01:40:10,176
Cigarette case.
Honest Injun, take a look.

933
01:40:10,427 --> 01:40:13,513
Just a peek, no touch.

934
01:40:18,977 --> 01:40:23,732
You might ask yourself:
"Why is today my time to die?"

935
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:30,447
Take it out. Slowly.

936
01:40:30,655 --> 01:40:33,408
Slowly.

937
01:40:33,992 --> 01:40:36,453
Open it.

938
01:40:38,121 --> 01:40:40,749
Everyone deserves to die.

939
01:40:40,957 --> 01:40:42,292
Ask God.

940
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:46,004
He kills across the board.

941
01:40:46,963 --> 01:40:50,091
So why shouldn't I?

942
01:40:50,342 --> 01:40:52,802
Bye.

943
01:40:52,886 --> 01:40:54,804
Here's a tip I learned from you.

944
01:40:55,013 --> 01:40:56,806
It's a focused detonation.
Only she blows.

945
01:40:57,015 --> 01:41:00,310
- It's pretty nifty, huh?
- Don't move it. It's a mercury switch.

946
01:41:00,518 --> 01:41:02,645
Any change in angle, it goes.

947
01:41:02,854 --> 01:41:04,147
Got it.

948
01:41:04,356 --> 01:41:07,317
Anyway, Ray, she's dead already.
What I need...

949
01:41:07,525 --> 01:41:10,153
...what I need is to take you alive
because my boss...

950
01:41:10,362 --> 01:41:12,697
...wants to look in your eyes
when you die.

951
01:41:12,906 --> 01:41:14,949
Sick fuck.

952
01:41:15,158 --> 01:41:16,576
I'm touched, really.

953
01:41:16,785 --> 01:41:19,788
What happened to us, Ray?

954
01:41:19,913 --> 01:41:22,457
We were...

955
01:41:22,665 --> 01:41:25,835
...we were good together.

956
01:41:26,044 --> 01:41:30,048
You were the rigger
and I was the trigger.

957
01:41:31,007 --> 01:41:33,468
You shouldn't have taken me down.

958
01:41:33,677 --> 01:41:37,514
Because, look at us now, you fuck!

959
01:41:38,807 --> 01:41:42,977
I see you're still into
the old memories, Ray.

960
01:41:43,603 --> 01:41:46,481
Those memories always do you in, right?

961
01:41:46,690 --> 01:41:49,484
It's that trying-to-save-the-innocent.

962
01:41:49,693 --> 01:41:52,529
You know your problem, Ray?

963
01:41:52,737 --> 01:41:54,197
You're too sentimental.

964
01:41:54,406 --> 01:41:57,867
There's nothing wrong
with being sentimental.

965
01:41:58,076 --> 01:42:02,080
Sometimes it can save your ass.

966
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,293
Here's a tip: no fail-safe.

967
01:42:07,502 --> 01:42:09,671
Pressure pads.

968
01:42:16,428 --> 01:42:20,181
30 seconds to total destruction.

969
01:42:21,433 --> 01:42:24,227
Slide it to me.

970
01:42:26,938 --> 01:42:29,441
25 seconds.

971
01:42:30,025 --> 01:42:31,735
It's all right.

972
01:42:31,943 --> 01:42:33,028
Just do it, May.

973
01:42:33,236 --> 01:42:35,947
Slide your hands out.

974
01:42:36,156 --> 01:42:39,492
20 seconds.

975
01:42:42,537 --> 01:42:44,998
Get out of here.
Straight down the right side.

976
01:42:45,206 --> 01:42:48,335
Not without you.

977
01:42:49,127 --> 01:42:52,047
I'm right behind you.

978
01:42:55,508 --> 01:42:57,969
10 seconds.

979
01:43:03,683 --> 01:43:05,268
5 seconds.

980
01:43:05,477 --> 01:43:07,979
Come on! Come on!

981
01:43:08,188 --> 01:43:11,107
3 seconds.

982
01:44:31,771 --> 01:44:34,482
Thank you.

983
01:44:43,158 --> 01:44:47,037
You are a kind God.

984
01:44:47,746 --> 01:44:50,290
Thank you.

985
01:45:14,814 --> 01:45:17,400
You bastarda!

986
01:45:29,079 --> 01:45:30,080
How do you feel?

987
01:45:30,288 --> 01:45:32,832
Better.
