1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,648
(Morse code beeping)

2
00:00:03,648 --> 00:00:04,790
- [Man On Radio] Hey, Triggy boy.

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:06,989
I think we're going to
have some help up here.

4
00:00:06,989 --> 00:00:08,946
There's three more balloons coming.

5
00:00:08,946 --> 00:00:10,280
- [Triggy On Radio] Yeah,
I just talked to 'em

6
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,924
on the other channel.

7
00:00:11,924 --> 00:00:14,459
Hope we have better luck than me and Ed.

8
00:00:14,459 --> 00:00:16,464
- [Man On Radio] We haven't
spotted anything down there.

9
00:00:16,464 --> 00:00:17,934
Did you feel that wind gust?

10
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:19,056
- [Triggy On Radio] Feel it?

11
00:00:19,056 --> 00:00:21,223
I got twisted 110 degrees!

12
00:00:22,267 --> 00:00:23,100
- [Man On Radio] Hey, will you guys

13
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,697
stop your complaining?

14
00:00:24,697 --> 00:00:26,405
This wind's small potatoes
compared with what

15
00:00:26,405 --> 00:00:29,600
got under Doc and those guys
trying to cross the ocean.

16
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,600
Their last radio contact sounded
like they'd hit a tornado.

17
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:35,849
- [Triggy On Radio] When'd you ever hear

18
00:00:35,849 --> 00:00:38,278
of a tornado at sea?

19
00:00:38,278 --> 00:00:40,463
- [Man On Radio] Well,
that's what Doc called it.

20
00:00:40,463 --> 00:00:43,969
Sounded like his balloon
was being torn apart.

21
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:48,239
Whatever the number, it got
him real good and surrounded.

22
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,962
- [Triggy On Radio] Surrounded?

23
00:00:49,962 --> 00:00:50,795
- [Man On Radio] The water, man.

24
00:00:50,795 --> 00:00:51,939
The ocean.

25
00:00:51,939 --> 00:00:53,938
Any way you shake it,
those poor guys wound up

26
00:00:53,938 --> 00:00:57,398
either on it, in it, or under it.

27
00:00:57,398 --> 00:01:00,148
(dramatic music)

28
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,739
(tense music)

29
00:03:30,652 --> 00:03:32,975
- Look at this land.

30
00:03:32,975 --> 00:03:35,744
I said, look at this land!

31
00:03:35,744 --> 00:03:37,656
This is solid land.

32
00:03:37,656 --> 00:03:39,694
The same old variety land that sustains

33
00:03:39,694 --> 00:03:41,568
even the weakest mortal.

34
00:03:41,568 --> 00:03:44,379
But it is not the promised land.

35
00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:45,315
No.

36
00:03:45,315 --> 00:03:47,641
Get on your knees, you sinner.

37
00:03:47,641 --> 00:03:51,182
And pray that you've been
saved from a watery grave.

38
00:03:51,182 --> 00:03:53,385
Don't forget the devil is demoralizing,

39
00:03:53,385 --> 00:03:55,468
debased, and dehydrating.

40
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,253
And you.

41
00:04:06,293 --> 00:04:08,376
You are a sinner.

42
00:04:08,376 --> 00:04:10,126
That is what you are.

43
00:04:13,177 --> 00:04:14,010
Hey!

44
00:04:18,636 --> 00:04:19,469
- Oh, man.

45
00:04:19,469 --> 00:04:22,091
Watch where you're falling.

46
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:22,924
Doc!

47
00:04:25,836 --> 00:04:26,669
Doc.

48
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:27,505
- Huh?

49
00:04:27,505 --> 00:04:28,338
- I'm hurt.

50
00:04:28,338 --> 00:04:29,171
- Where?

51
00:04:32,636 --> 00:04:33,980
It's all right.

52
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:37,040
If it wasn't, I wouldn't be able to...

53
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,628
I told you to grab my medical bag.

54
00:04:38,628 --> 00:04:40,985
- Well, I had it, Doc,
but it slipped away.

55
00:04:40,985 --> 00:04:42,410
I had Melvin by the tail.

56
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,399
- I guess we all panicked a little.

57
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:45,659
All right, don't use it for a while,

58
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:47,909
but try to keep it working.

59
00:04:48,758 --> 00:04:49,675
- Hey, Doc.

60
00:04:51,206 --> 00:04:52,996
You know, if we could find some dry wood,

61
00:04:52,996 --> 00:04:54,463
we could light a fire.

62
00:04:54,463 --> 00:04:57,563
Or maybe we could build a raft.

63
00:04:57,563 --> 00:05:01,896
But how are we gonna make
it over these bluffs, huh?

64
00:05:43,328 --> 00:05:46,328
(suspenseful music)

65
00:06:25,792 --> 00:06:28,375
(Melvin barks)

66
00:08:03,595 --> 00:08:05,757
Well, we've got plenty
of wood for a raft here.

67
00:08:05,757 --> 00:08:06,590
- Yeah.

68
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,923
Dead trees are buoyant, too.

69
00:08:17,977 --> 00:08:19,983
- This reminds me of
Quail Gardens in Philly.

70
00:08:19,983 --> 00:08:21,492
(grunting)
(tone pulsing)

71
00:08:21,492 --> 00:08:22,592
- What's the matter?

72
00:08:22,592 --> 00:08:23,425
- My arm!

73
00:08:24,398 --> 00:08:25,231
- Help him.

74
00:08:25,231 --> 00:08:26,354
- 30 pound weight or something.

75
00:08:26,354 --> 00:08:27,187
- Pull him up.

76
00:08:27,187 --> 00:08:28,020
- Come on, Doc.

77
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:28,853
Get me out of this.

78
00:08:28,853 --> 00:08:30,186
- I'm trying to.

79
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,203
Okay?

80
00:08:39,749 --> 00:08:40,889
- Holy cow.

81
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:42,285
Look at this.

82
00:08:42,285 --> 00:08:45,285
(suspenseful music)

83
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:55,409
- Hey!

84
00:08:58,322 --> 00:08:59,155
Melvin.

85
00:09:00,365 --> 00:09:02,448
(laughs)

86
00:09:30,426 --> 00:09:32,299
- We crashed in a balloon, you know?

87
00:09:32,299 --> 00:09:33,360
Over the ocean.

88
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,415
You know, a balloon?

89
00:09:34,415 --> 00:09:36,301
- Well, we were blown
off course, actually.

90
00:09:36,301 --> 00:09:39,520
And we were miles out there and...

91
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,603
Where are we?

92
00:09:45,097 --> 00:09:46,851
- You are pretty.

93
00:09:46,851 --> 00:09:48,277
- Oh. (laughs)

94
00:09:48,277 --> 00:09:51,985
Well, my name is Curtis
and this is Paul Hadley.

95
00:09:51,985 --> 00:09:55,404
And this is Mark and that's Dino.

96
00:09:55,404 --> 00:09:58,990
Paul Hadley, we call him Doc
because he's, you know, uh.

97
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:01,240
(coughing)

98
00:10:02,406 --> 00:10:03,656
- Come with us.

99
00:10:06,922 --> 00:10:08,140
- What about your friend there?

100
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,390
- Come with us.

101
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:20,215
(suspenseful music)

102
00:10:51,572 --> 00:10:52,905
- [Mark] Mm-hmm.

103
00:10:59,562 --> 00:11:00,395
- Melvin!

104
00:11:05,527 --> 00:11:06,360
Melvin!

105
00:11:23,332 --> 00:11:25,370
- Dino, let's go eat.

106
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:26,203
- Look.

107
00:11:27,164 --> 00:11:30,581
That's the weirdest thing I've ever seen.

108
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:36,421
- Yeah.

109
00:11:36,421 --> 00:11:37,254
Come on.

110
00:11:37,254 --> 00:11:39,337
They're ready to feed us.

111
00:12:17,965 --> 00:12:18,798
Mm.

112
00:12:20,859 --> 00:12:21,692
Mm-hmm.

113
00:12:28,675 --> 00:12:31,675
(rhythmic drumming)

114
00:14:35,236 --> 00:14:37,678
- Oh, punishment's over, huh?

115
00:14:37,678 --> 00:14:38,615
- Not punishment.

116
00:14:38,615 --> 00:14:39,756
Initiation.

117
00:14:39,756 --> 00:14:41,565
- Initiation.

118
00:14:41,565 --> 00:14:44,288
I was initiated one time
at the Greyhound Lodge

119
00:14:44,288 --> 00:14:46,718
during one of the worst
tornadoes that Kansas City.

120
00:14:46,718 --> 00:14:51,334
(grunting)
(tone pulsing)

121
00:14:51,334 --> 00:14:52,916
- Not again.

122
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:53,749
Get him up.

123
00:14:53,749 --> 00:14:54,767
- It's my whole side.

124
00:14:54,767 --> 00:14:55,600
- All right.

125
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,433
Relax, relax.

126
00:14:56,433 --> 00:14:57,302
Try to work the hand.

127
00:14:57,302 --> 00:14:58,878
Work it, work it, work it.

128
00:14:58,878 --> 00:15:01,450
- It's never acted this way.

129
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:02,475
- It's okay?

130
00:15:02,475 --> 00:15:03,308
- Yeah.

131
00:15:03,308 --> 00:15:04,141
- All right?

132
00:15:04,141 --> 00:15:04,974
Come on, walk.

133
00:15:04,974 --> 00:15:06,658
- Okay, let's go.

134
00:15:06,658 --> 00:15:07,491
Come on.

135
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:13,810
(suspenseful music)

136
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:37,683
- Hey.

137
00:15:39,249 --> 00:15:40,126
What is this here?

138
00:15:40,126 --> 00:15:42,043
- We're falling behind.

139
00:16:25,377 --> 00:16:27,700
(girl screaming)

140
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,450
(dramatic music)

141
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:06,274
(electricity zaps)

142
00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:18,282
- I'll fix that clown.

143
00:17:18,282 --> 00:17:19,365
- Let him go.

144
00:17:21,639 --> 00:17:24,124
- Hey, what happened?

145
00:17:24,124 --> 00:17:26,610
- Just another attempt by
Zyrid to take one of us off.

146
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:27,443
- Zyrid?

147
00:17:28,898 --> 00:17:32,418
- He tries this often, but
he's programed to weaken.

148
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:33,751
- But who is he?

149
00:17:35,575 --> 00:17:37,408
- Part of a ship's crew.

150
00:17:37,408 --> 00:17:40,424
Normal until they experimented on him.

151
00:17:40,424 --> 00:17:42,386
- Until they experimented.

152
00:17:42,386 --> 00:17:44,636
(laughing)

153
00:17:50,122 --> 00:17:53,627
- You kiddos got a little problem, huh?

154
00:17:53,627 --> 00:17:55,830
- I've warned you before.

155
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:58,555
You're going to be very
sorry if you don't stop this.

156
00:17:58,555 --> 00:17:59,388
- Hey, hey, now.

157
00:17:59,388 --> 00:18:01,569
You just take it easy.

158
00:18:01,569 --> 00:18:03,441
We ain't responsible
for every little thing

159
00:18:03,441 --> 00:18:04,988
that happens to ya, huh?

160
00:18:04,988 --> 00:18:05,928
- Oh, no.

161
00:18:05,928 --> 00:18:08,087
- You should be thankful
for the mirrors we brought.

162
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:08,920
- Yeah.

163
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,087
- I'll be thankful and you be careful.

164
00:18:14,805 --> 00:18:17,055
(laughing)

165
00:18:56,055 --> 00:18:57,646
- I suggest we get on our horses

166
00:18:57,646 --> 00:19:00,009
and get out of here right now.

167
00:19:00,009 --> 00:19:03,294
- Well, there's no question
they're deep into witchcraft,

168
00:19:03,294 --> 00:19:05,679
so that might throw your
travel plans into reverse.

169
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:06,512
- Hey, they like us.

170
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:07,345
They're not gonna.

171
00:19:07,345 --> 00:19:08,178
- Hey, look.

172
00:19:08,178 --> 00:19:09,011
I don't want to press it.

173
00:19:09,011 --> 00:19:10,051
- They didn't seem to care in the least

174
00:19:10,051 --> 00:19:11,438
about that phenomenon with your arm.

175
00:19:11,438 --> 00:19:13,067
- Oh, I got that figured.

176
00:19:13,067 --> 00:19:15,432
It's when you mix a
particular place, not here,

177
00:19:15,432 --> 00:19:18,042
but on the outside, that's
when the power hits you.

178
00:19:18,042 --> 00:19:18,875
- The power?

179
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,156
- Yeah, it's sort of built in.

180
00:19:20,156 --> 00:19:21,867
It's like telepathy.

181
00:19:21,867 --> 00:19:22,700
- Telepathy?

182
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,533
- No, no, no, no.

183
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:24,963
It is like telepathy.

184
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:25,852
- What are you talking about?

185
00:19:25,852 --> 00:19:26,685
- Come on, come on.

186
00:19:26,685 --> 00:19:28,268
I'm gonna show you.

187
00:19:30,422 --> 00:19:31,521
How's it going?

188
00:19:31,521 --> 00:19:33,357
- Oh, pretty good, Curt.

189
00:19:33,357 --> 00:19:36,257
- Did Dino ever tell you
about his football days?

190
00:19:36,257 --> 00:19:37,721
- Football?

191
00:19:37,721 --> 00:19:41,036
- [Curtis] Like the time
he scored three touchdowns.

192
00:19:41,036 --> 00:19:42,582
- Against Miami.

193
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:43,492
(grunting)

194
00:19:43,492 --> 00:19:44,433
- Here, let me help you.

195
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,266
Come here.

196
00:19:45,266 --> 00:19:46,099
Stand up.

197
00:19:46,099 --> 00:19:46,932
- Well?

198
00:19:46,932 --> 00:19:49,396
(Melvin barking)

199
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,229
So watch what you say.

200
00:19:53,608 --> 00:19:55,691
- If I can't ask about...

201
00:19:56,745 --> 00:19:58,576
What can I ask about?

202
00:19:58,576 --> 00:20:00,406
(laughing)

203
00:20:00,406 --> 00:20:02,073
- Anything you want.

204
00:20:04,317 --> 00:20:06,560
We got no secrets here.

205
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,353
We got no secrets here, have we?

206
00:20:08,353 --> 00:20:13,353
- I think you'll find just the
opposite if you come with us.

207
00:20:13,523 --> 00:20:14,356
- Come where?

208
00:20:14,356 --> 00:20:15,726
- Not far.

209
00:20:15,726 --> 00:20:18,559
Where the valleys rise to the sun.

210
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,011
- Okay.

211
00:20:22,011 --> 00:20:24,261
(laughing)

212
00:20:31,966 --> 00:20:34,966
(suspenseful music)

213
00:21:29,258 --> 00:21:30,767
- You'll not be going there.

214
00:21:30,767 --> 00:21:31,600
Not yet.

215
00:21:58,287 --> 00:22:00,537
(laughing)

216
00:22:01,803 --> 00:22:02,902
- I'll make some arrangements.

217
00:22:02,902 --> 00:22:05,101
Get you an invitation up to the house.

218
00:22:05,101 --> 00:22:06,162
- Invitation?

219
00:22:06,162 --> 00:22:08,320
- It may take a while, may not.

220
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,570
(laughing)

221
00:22:37,185 --> 00:22:38,976
- Do they think we're
crazy enough to eat this?

222
00:22:38,976 --> 00:22:41,624
- It's probably all right.

223
00:22:41,624 --> 00:22:43,041
- The other tray.

224
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,327
- [Doc] Hello.

225
00:23:36,577 --> 00:23:37,923
- Who are you?

226
00:23:37,923 --> 00:23:39,185
- I'd like to ask the same thing.

227
00:23:39,185 --> 00:23:42,102
We're about as startled as you are.

228
00:23:43,337 --> 00:23:45,208
- How did you get here?

229
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:46,268
- We were ballooning.

230
00:23:46,268 --> 00:23:47,703
We were trying to break
a long distance record.

231
00:23:47,703 --> 00:23:48,536
We came here.

232
00:23:48,536 --> 00:23:49,369
- No!

233
00:23:49,369 --> 00:23:50,310
Don't say where.

234
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,288
Shh.

235
00:23:51,288 --> 00:23:52,428
You never say where.

236
00:23:52,428 --> 00:23:53,690
- [Curtis] Yeah, we know about that.

237
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:56,773
It took us a while, but we found out.

238
00:23:59,019 --> 00:24:00,686
- My name is Jayson.

239
00:24:02,321 --> 00:24:04,154
I'm Clay Jayson.

240
00:24:04,154 --> 00:24:05,821
Would you like some?

241
00:24:09,787 --> 00:24:10,954
I come from...

242
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:15,270
It doesn't matter where I come from.

243
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:18,402
- How long have you been here?

244
00:24:18,402 --> 00:24:19,295
- How long?

245
00:24:19,295 --> 00:24:20,150
- Yeah.

246
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,733
- Have I been here?

247
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:24,403
How long?

248
00:24:25,603 --> 00:24:26,686
Uh, how long?

249
00:24:28,985 --> 00:24:29,818
Um.

250
00:24:37,779 --> 00:24:38,612
Uh, 17.

251
00:24:41,305 --> 00:24:43,138
This is the 17th year.

252
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,220
- 17th year?

253
00:24:49,906 --> 00:24:52,573
- I was a captain on a schooner.

254
00:24:56,232 --> 00:24:57,732
There was a storm.

255
00:24:58,631 --> 00:25:01,605
The biggest storm I ever saw.

256
00:25:01,605 --> 00:25:05,438
With huge waves and flung
everybody overboard.

257
00:25:10,463 --> 00:25:11,463
And I clung.

258
00:25:13,145 --> 00:25:14,645
I clung to a reef.

259
00:25:18,238 --> 00:25:19,655
They're all gone.

260
00:25:21,012 --> 00:25:23,762
All the others, they're all gone.

261
00:25:26,219 --> 00:25:29,386
- You've been alone here for 17 years?

262
00:25:30,432 --> 00:25:32,551
(wood clatters)

263
00:25:32,551 --> 00:25:34,134
- They're all gone.

264
00:25:39,235 --> 00:25:41,402
And in the deafening roar,

265
00:25:48,396 --> 00:25:51,063
in monstrous surf, I saw Lenore.

266
00:25:54,043 --> 00:25:55,293
My wife Lenore.

267
00:25:58,159 --> 00:25:59,592
Mr. Poe.

268
00:25:59,592 --> 00:26:02,509
Mr. Edgar Allen Poe had me in mind.

269
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,255
Do you believe that?

270
00:26:05,255 --> 00:26:06,195
- [Doc] Why are you in this cell?

271
00:26:06,195 --> 00:26:07,778
What have you done?

272
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,946
- What have I done?

273
00:26:11,946 --> 00:26:13,113
What did I do?

274
00:26:16,147 --> 00:26:17,157
Here, I'll show you.

275
00:26:17,157 --> 00:26:17,990
Look.

276
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:18,909
No!

277
00:26:18,909 --> 00:26:19,966
No!

278
00:26:19,966 --> 00:26:21,383
It's too hideous.

279
00:26:23,352 --> 00:26:28,119
I have given red corpuscles
enough to fill a frigate.

280
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:30,452
And they, they keep me alive

281
00:26:31,782 --> 00:26:35,406
so the supply will never drop off.

282
00:26:35,406 --> 00:26:37,277
Do you understand?

283
00:26:37,277 --> 00:26:38,950
- You're a...

284
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,581
You're a donor?

285
00:26:40,581 --> 00:26:41,476
- That's a good one.

286
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:42,309
Donor, yes.

287
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,287
It's something like that.

288
00:26:44,287 --> 00:26:45,794
- I don't know who we're gonna run into,

289
00:26:45,794 --> 00:26:46,650
or how many they're gonna be,

290
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:49,094
but I don't want to end up in a cell.

291
00:26:49,094 --> 00:26:52,193
Do you know where I can find a
gun or where I can steal one?

292
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:54,776
(door opening)

293
00:26:56,431 --> 00:26:58,931
(tense music)

294
00:27:07,779 --> 00:27:10,446
- While many demon ghosts go by,

295
00:27:12,016 --> 00:27:14,599
I pray my dead Lenore shall lie

296
00:27:15,914 --> 00:27:18,081
forever with unopened eye.

297
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:28,465
- This man must be
sedated from time to time.

298
00:27:28,465 --> 00:27:30,131
He's dangerous.

299
00:27:30,131 --> 00:27:32,739
- He didn't seem that way to me.

300
00:27:32,739 --> 00:27:35,831
- When you've been around
here as long as I have,

301
00:27:35,831 --> 00:27:38,802
you can start giving out opinions.

302
00:27:38,802 --> 00:27:41,454
Don't concern yourself with him.

303
00:27:41,454 --> 00:27:45,537
Our request for your
invitation has been granted.

304
00:27:52,575 --> 00:27:54,246
- My best brandy.

305
00:27:54,246 --> 00:27:55,549
The oldest in stock.

306
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:57,549
I'm Sheila Frankenstein.

307
00:28:01,368 --> 00:28:02,268
- How do you do?

308
00:28:02,268 --> 00:28:03,613
- Actually, it's von Helsing.

309
00:28:03,613 --> 00:28:06,196
I don't prefer my married name.

310
00:28:17,169 --> 00:28:19,329
- I'm Dr. Hadley.

311
00:28:19,329 --> 00:28:22,329
This is Curt Ryan, and Dino, Markie.

312
00:28:24,432 --> 00:28:25,856
- Keep this away from Jocko.

313
00:28:25,856 --> 00:28:27,241
He wouldn't appreciate it.

314
00:28:27,241 --> 00:28:28,992
- Jocko won't seek the brandy.

315
00:28:28,992 --> 00:28:30,954
Not when there's rum around.

316
00:28:30,954 --> 00:28:32,759
- [Doc] That's quite a
famous name you have.

317
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:35,592
- Oh, it has my deepest reverence.

318
00:28:36,879 --> 00:28:41,361
- Is there any relationship
between you and, um?

319
00:28:41,361 --> 00:28:42,194
- Oh, yes.

320
00:28:45,233 --> 00:28:48,983
Dr. Frankenstein, my
great-great grandfather.

321
00:28:51,761 --> 00:28:55,019
He originated everything on the island.

322
00:28:55,019 --> 00:28:58,769
Including that power
which paralyzes the arm.

323
00:29:01,659 --> 00:29:05,571
Frankenstein set many forces in action.

324
00:29:05,571 --> 00:29:08,654
And in doing so, created his own law.

325
00:29:10,053 --> 00:29:13,318
He still enforces it by
channeling through my husband.

326
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:14,568
- Your husband?

327
00:29:26,302 --> 00:29:31,277
- Please, understand that
everything is open here.

328
00:29:31,277 --> 00:29:34,209
There's nothing I wish
in any way to be hidden.

329
00:29:34,209 --> 00:29:37,221
So I'll be boldly specific.

330
00:29:37,221 --> 00:29:39,337
My husband was an integral part

331
00:29:39,337 --> 00:29:42,598
of the Frankenstein experiments.

332
00:29:42,598 --> 00:29:46,140
In the early days, the two
of them traveled far beyond

333
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:49,153
man's understanding of life and death.

334
00:29:49,153 --> 00:29:51,997
So very far that an unbreakable bond

335
00:29:51,997 --> 00:29:53,997
was formed between them.

336
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:59,246
It endures today with one
dead and the other alive.

337
00:29:59,246 --> 00:30:01,300
Through their communication,

338
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,765
Dr. Frankenstein still
controls this island.

339
00:30:04,765 --> 00:30:07,932
- He's pretty happy about you fellows.

340
00:30:10,179 --> 00:30:12,179
- Even though he's dead?

341
00:30:13,723 --> 00:30:15,719
- Being dead's no problem.

342
00:30:15,719 --> 00:30:17,634
It's just the opposite.

343
00:30:17,634 --> 00:30:22,551
What do you think was pulling
you here, your own free will?

344
00:30:23,463 --> 00:30:26,721
- Hey, remember my mentioning to you

345
00:30:26,721 --> 00:30:28,673
when the balloon was twisting?

346
00:30:28,673 --> 00:30:32,340
The wind was bringing
on a different effect.

347
00:30:33,554 --> 00:30:36,934
It seemed like we were
caught in some kind of power.

348
00:30:36,934 --> 00:30:39,184
(laughing)

349
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,393
- It's true.

350
00:30:41,393 --> 00:30:43,172
Your arrival is an omen.

351
00:30:43,172 --> 00:30:44,422
- Yes, an omen.

352
00:30:45,908 --> 00:30:50,575
- The girls like you and that
demands your helping them.

353
00:30:52,242 --> 00:30:55,374
- You want us to help the girls?

354
00:30:55,374 --> 00:30:58,629
- Perhaps some of you can
serve to impregnate them

355
00:30:58,629 --> 00:31:01,197
in order to ensure future generations.

356
00:31:01,197 --> 00:31:03,447
(laughing)

357
00:31:04,418 --> 00:31:09,418
- We have accommodations,
facilities, a social life.

358
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:13,347
And you fellas have
stepped right inside of it.

359
00:31:14,683 --> 00:31:16,027
- Yes, well.

360
00:31:16,027 --> 00:31:18,470
I think we better get back on the track

361
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:20,389
of finding some kind of transportation.

362
00:31:20,389 --> 00:31:21,651
I don't mean to seem ungrateful,

363
00:31:21,651 --> 00:31:25,568
but we'd better get on
with what we have to do.

364
00:31:26,864 --> 00:31:30,406
- I'm afraid that any
such action is entirely

365
00:31:30,406 --> 00:31:32,656
in the hands of my husband.

366
00:31:34,113 --> 00:31:35,863
- [Mark] Where is he?

367
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:42,455
- You'll see him.

368
00:31:43,321 --> 00:31:45,478
Our guests will need a good night's sleep.

369
00:31:45,478 --> 00:31:47,189
Unlock the rooms by the lab.

370
00:31:47,189 --> 00:31:48,606
- Yes, of course.

371
00:31:53,785 --> 00:31:56,285
(tense music)

372
00:32:03,105 --> 00:32:03,938
- Aside.

373
00:32:04,859 --> 00:32:05,692
Aside.

374
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,220
Your presence doesn't bother this one.

375
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,992
He's balanced quite well.

376
00:32:14,992 --> 00:32:17,563
They're all programmed
to be perfect guards,

377
00:32:17,563 --> 00:32:19,813
but some are unpredictable.

378
00:32:23,143 --> 00:32:24,410
- What's happened to them?

379
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:27,708
- They've gone through
some elaborate changes.

380
00:32:27,708 --> 00:32:29,701
- Caused by what?

381
00:32:29,701 --> 00:32:32,344
- The quest of science.

382
00:32:32,344 --> 00:32:36,047
- If they're unpredictable,
couldn't that lead to violence?

383
00:32:36,047 --> 00:32:38,534
- Sometimes beyond tolerance.

384
00:32:38,534 --> 00:32:41,117
In such cases, a gun is useless

385
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:44,686
because they have no bloodstream.

386
00:32:44,686 --> 00:32:48,192
They have to be literally cut
in half with a machine gun.

387
00:32:48,192 --> 00:32:51,692
They do fine, except for the eyes.

388
00:32:51,692 --> 00:32:53,731
They've been using a local narcotic

389
00:32:53,731 --> 00:32:56,376
which causes optic problems.

390
00:32:56,376 --> 00:32:59,959
They've become severely
sensitive to light.

391
00:33:24,957 --> 00:33:26,585
- [Doc] This is marvelous.

392
00:33:26,585 --> 00:33:27,480
- Try it.

393
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,813
You'll be in for a surprise.

394
00:33:31,832 --> 00:33:34,763
- I can't believe the
reading on this meter.

395
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:36,108
Our best researchers haven't dreamt

396
00:33:36,108 --> 00:33:37,739
of anything even close to this.

397
00:33:37,739 --> 00:33:38,637
How'd you work it out?

398
00:33:38,637 --> 00:33:40,185
- Well, I didn't.

399
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:42,589
This island was originally chosen,

400
00:33:42,589 --> 00:33:45,848
not simply because of its barrier bluffs,

401
00:33:45,848 --> 00:33:48,331
but because it was once a landing site

402
00:33:48,331 --> 00:33:52,487
for men and women of a
superior civilization.

403
00:33:52,487 --> 00:33:55,320
(machine beeping)

404
00:34:00,507 --> 00:34:02,090
- Nice little item.

405
00:34:06,457 --> 00:34:07,290
A brain?

406
00:34:11,586 --> 00:34:15,416
- Are you saying that aliens
landed here some time ago?

407
00:34:15,416 --> 00:34:16,249
- Yeah, aliens.

408
00:34:16,249 --> 00:34:17,835
That explains it about the girls.

409
00:34:17,835 --> 00:34:20,073
- The girls are direct descendants.

410
00:34:20,073 --> 00:34:23,899
Although their blood is mixed
with that of our own people.

411
00:34:23,899 --> 00:34:28,566
- [Curtis] And some are more
on one side than the other.

412
00:34:31,395 --> 00:34:35,478
- My husband has been bed
ridden for a long time.

413
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:40,559
This is my husband Dr. von Helsing.

414
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:43,059
The assistant to Frankenstein.

415
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:12,482
(machine beeping)

416
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:16,713
(tone pulsing)

417
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:27,456
(electricity zapping)

418
00:35:36,472 --> 00:35:38,857
- I have the power.

419
00:35:38,857 --> 00:35:41,960
The power of the Golden Thread.

420
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,627
Let the devils move.

421
00:35:44,588 --> 00:35:47,588
(rhythmic drumming)

422
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,617
- O disciple of the 12 Lions.

423
00:36:50,617 --> 00:36:53,265
Ye shall have the power.

424
00:36:53,265 --> 00:36:56,076
The power shall be yours.

425
00:36:56,076 --> 00:36:56,909
The power.

426
00:36:57,783 --> 00:36:58,616
The power.

427
00:36:59,573 --> 00:37:00,406
The power.

428
00:37:01,729 --> 00:37:02,562
The power.

429
00:37:16,269 --> 00:37:18,852
(tone pulsing)

430
00:37:44,946 --> 00:37:46,196
- Look at that.

431
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:48,014
Holy cow.

432
00:37:49,864 --> 00:37:52,473
They're the most beautiful
vegetables I've ever seen.

433
00:37:52,473 --> 00:37:55,202
- Well, part of it's in the original soil.

434
00:37:55,202 --> 00:37:58,216
But mostly it's due to
the nutrient compounds.

435
00:37:58,216 --> 00:38:00,742
(laughing)

436
00:38:00,742 --> 00:38:01,575
- Wow.

437
00:38:07,744 --> 00:38:11,000
- Growth is so rapid, we
have to filter the sun.

438
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,833
- Really?

439
00:38:11,833 --> 00:38:12,913
- Wow.

440
00:38:12,913 --> 00:38:13,830
- Oh, well.

441
00:38:15,111 --> 00:38:17,397
I'll let you show yourselves around now.

442
00:38:17,397 --> 00:38:18,980
I'm due at the lab.

443
00:38:20,129 --> 00:38:22,940
I'll be integrating
some unusual blood types

444
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:25,557
if you care to observe.

445
00:38:25,557 --> 00:38:26,390
- Oh, yes.

446
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:27,270
I'd like to very much.

447
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:31,427
I think, perhaps, later
on if it's all right.

448
00:38:31,427 --> 00:38:33,910
- Well, if you like
sports, they're over there.

449
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:35,622
- Oh, sports?

450
00:38:35,622 --> 00:38:37,943
(laughing)

451
00:38:37,943 --> 00:38:38,943
- Up, sport!

452
00:38:39,935 --> 00:38:41,102
Come on, mate!

453
00:38:42,051 --> 00:38:43,634
We go to the sport.

454
00:38:49,009 --> 00:38:51,259
(growling)

455
00:39:00,452 --> 00:39:02,702
(laughing)

456
00:39:12,215 --> 00:39:13,882
Hold it, mates.

457
00:39:13,882 --> 00:39:14,899
Hold it.

458
00:39:14,899 --> 00:39:17,149
(laughing)

459
00:39:18,284 --> 00:39:19,284
Hey, listen.

460
00:39:23,532 --> 00:39:25,782
(laughing)

461
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:51,030
Gotta do it real slow and
steady to keep 'em embalmed.

462
00:39:53,894 --> 00:39:56,144
(laughing)

463
00:39:59,738 --> 00:40:01,446
- Hey, Jocko.

464
00:40:01,446 --> 00:40:03,366
How'd you lose the eye?

465
00:40:03,366 --> 00:40:04,593
- How'd I lose me eye?

466
00:40:04,593 --> 00:40:05,426
- Yeah.

467
00:40:05,426 --> 00:40:06,259
How'd you lose your eye?

468
00:40:06,259 --> 00:40:08,034
- How did I lose me eye?

469
00:40:08,034 --> 00:40:11,201
This is all they left of it, neighbor.

470
00:40:12,922 --> 00:40:14,922
Get out of me way, mate.

471
00:40:31,572 --> 00:40:34,322
(dramatic music)

472
00:40:44,715 --> 00:40:46,965
(growling)

473
00:41:23,762 --> 00:41:26,012
(grunting)

474
00:41:29,093 --> 00:41:31,676
(Jocko laughs)

475
00:42:05,863 --> 00:42:07,251
- [Mark] Hey, Jayson.

476
00:42:07,251 --> 00:42:10,251
- Oh, Guy Devere, hast thou no tear?

477
00:42:11,856 --> 00:42:13,773
Weep now when evermore.

478
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,147
See on yon drear and rigid beer.

479
00:42:20,384 --> 00:42:21,801
Lo lies, my love.

480
00:42:24,405 --> 00:42:25,238
Lenore.

481
00:42:26,773 --> 00:42:28,400
- Jayson?

482
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,400
How do you feel, Jayson?

483
00:42:32,028 --> 00:42:32,861
- Oh, yes.

484
00:42:34,549 --> 00:42:36,265
Let the burial rights be read.

485
00:42:36,265 --> 00:42:38,182
A funeral song be sung.

486
00:42:39,114 --> 00:42:40,447
A dirge for her,

487
00:42:42,701 --> 00:42:44,034
the doubly dead.

488
00:42:48,077 --> 00:42:51,077
In that she died so young, so young.

489
00:42:55,051 --> 00:42:56,190
- [Mark] Hey, Jayson.

490
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:57,255
Jayson.

491
00:42:57,255 --> 00:42:58,232
- So young.

492
00:42:58,232 --> 00:42:59,863
- [Mark] Hey, Jayson.

493
00:42:59,863 --> 00:43:01,578
Don't you remember us?

494
00:43:01,578 --> 00:43:03,000
We wanna help you.

495
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,178
- Jayson, do you feel numbness anywhere?

496
00:43:06,178 --> 00:43:09,027
- In that she died so young.

497
00:43:09,027 --> 00:43:11,183
- Look, I think the best bet

498
00:43:11,183 --> 00:43:13,690
is to find out what the drug is.

499
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:15,815
If she'll tell me that,

500
00:43:15,815 --> 00:43:18,951
I might be able to find
what I need in the lab.

501
00:43:18,951 --> 00:43:19,784
- Yeah.

502
00:43:20,781 --> 00:43:23,698
We better start building that raft.

503
00:43:33,892 --> 00:43:34,725
- Hey, Melvin.

504
00:43:34,725 --> 00:43:36,418
Been behaving yourself?

505
00:43:36,418 --> 00:43:37,886
He been giving you much trouble?

506
00:43:37,886 --> 00:43:38,969
- Not at all.

507
00:43:41,054 --> 00:43:43,909
- I really appreciate you.

508
00:43:43,909 --> 00:43:45,863
I mean, you've really been a big help.

509
00:43:45,863 --> 00:43:46,946
- I love him.

510
00:43:47,876 --> 00:43:48,709
- Well.

511
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:50,587
- [Mark] Dino, we're gonna
check out the cave openings,

512
00:43:50,587 --> 00:43:52,993
you check out the beach, okay?

513
00:43:52,993 --> 00:43:55,027
- Can you put Melvin inside for a while?

514
00:43:55,027 --> 00:43:56,213
- Sure.

515
00:43:56,213 --> 00:43:57,603
- You can come down to the ocean with me.

516
00:43:57,603 --> 00:44:00,186
Help me collect some driftwood.

517
00:44:01,258 --> 00:44:04,091
(machine beeping)

518
00:44:07,909 --> 00:44:08,909
- It's good.

519
00:44:09,745 --> 00:44:10,578
Good.

520
00:44:10,578 --> 00:44:12,328
Exceptionally strong.

521
00:44:13,246 --> 00:44:17,329
- I don't dare hope that
it will remain that way.

522
00:44:20,208 --> 00:44:24,111
- Dr. Frankenstein is considering
a new plan I've worked up.

523
00:44:24,111 --> 00:44:26,150
We're most optimistic about it.

524
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:27,708
- You know, when I hear
you casually mention

525
00:44:27,708 --> 00:44:30,517
communicating with Dr. Frankenstein,

526
00:44:30,517 --> 00:44:33,580
communicating with a dead man,

527
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:35,899
I don't know quite how to take it.

528
00:44:35,899 --> 00:44:38,790
- It's not quite so
bizarre as you might think.

529
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:39,623
It's fact.

530
00:44:40,664 --> 00:44:43,801
But my husband's the one who communicates.

531
00:44:43,801 --> 00:44:46,122
I can get through only rarely.

532
00:44:46,122 --> 00:44:49,500
I could in this case
because this particular plan

533
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:52,105
has great bearing on our future.

534
00:44:52,105 --> 00:44:54,383
It promises that my husband

535
00:44:54,383 --> 00:44:57,383
will be out of this bed permanently.

536
00:44:58,781 --> 00:45:03,781
- When you learn of the incredible
capabilities of the mind,

537
00:45:05,224 --> 00:45:09,224
you will realize how many
things fall within it.

538
00:45:11,265 --> 00:45:14,809
Like the power that's
used to control the one

539
00:45:14,809 --> 00:45:17,642
who attacks those girls out there.

540
00:45:18,885 --> 00:45:22,302
They can only produce inferior offspring,

541
00:45:23,772 --> 00:45:26,522
so a power source has been set up

542
00:45:27,828 --> 00:45:29,995
which in time weakens him.

543
00:45:32,729 --> 00:45:36,146
And the others you have seen, the guards,

544
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:42,550
they have no bloodstream
because they need none.

545
00:45:44,447 --> 00:45:46,780
They live on psychic energy.

546
00:45:51,208 --> 00:45:55,041
Dr. Frankenstein and I
learned of these things

547
00:45:56,753 --> 00:45:58,586
early in our research.

548
00:46:01,815 --> 00:46:06,092
- You keep referring to
work with Dr. Frankenstein.

549
00:46:06,092 --> 00:46:10,675
But in the framework of time,
how can that possibly be?

550
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:12,883
- Good god, man.

551
00:46:15,974 --> 00:46:17,641
Didn't she tell you?

552
00:46:19,312 --> 00:46:21,395
I'm almost 200 years old.

553
00:46:27,431 --> 00:46:29,186
- We know we stopped
your work and everything,

554
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:31,468
and like, we really do appreciate it.

555
00:46:31,468 --> 00:46:32,301
- All right, girls.

556
00:46:32,301 --> 00:46:33,344
Now here's what we want you to do.

557
00:46:33,344 --> 00:46:35,266
I want you to go down to the
woods and find some logs.

558
00:46:35,266 --> 00:46:36,367
Some straight logs.

559
00:46:36,367 --> 00:46:38,364
You get 'em and you bring 'em back here.

560
00:46:38,364 --> 00:46:40,604
Now, I want to examine them
before we go down to the beach.

561
00:46:40,604 --> 00:46:44,027
Oh, and I want a few of you
to start weaving some rope.

562
00:46:44,027 --> 00:46:46,433
Use the kind that supports
the roof of that hut.

563
00:46:46,433 --> 00:46:47,651
That should be good
enough, don't you think?

564
00:46:47,651 --> 00:46:48,833
- Yeah.

565
00:46:48,833 --> 00:46:51,118
See, none of us have
ever made a raft before.

566
00:46:51,118 --> 00:46:52,138
- Oh, come on, Curt.

567
00:46:52,138 --> 00:46:53,400
I wouldn't worry about that.

568
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,274
This raft is gonna be seaworthy,

569
00:46:55,274 --> 00:46:58,107
and good and strong like any ship.

570
00:47:07,481 --> 00:47:09,981
(tense music)

571
00:47:15,890 --> 00:47:19,121
- [Doc] There, hold that point.

572
00:47:19,121 --> 00:47:22,522
Part of it's holding, but
the oscillator is slow.

573
00:47:22,522 --> 00:47:25,617
(machine beeping)

574
00:47:25,617 --> 00:47:28,034
- It's steady at 1,800 volts.

575
00:47:32,536 --> 00:47:35,119
It should peak at about 40,000.

576
00:47:39,721 --> 00:47:41,309
- Those carriers are
pretty close together.

577
00:47:41,309 --> 00:47:43,567
They could be acting as a transformer.

578
00:47:43,567 --> 00:47:44,507
- Yes, of corse.

579
00:47:44,507 --> 00:47:46,113
Of course, it could be.

580
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:48,439
(coughing)

581
00:47:48,439 --> 00:47:50,756
- [Doc] What is it?

582
00:47:50,756 --> 00:47:52,173
- Just the usual.

583
00:47:53,847 --> 00:47:58,680
I'm afraid continual life has
its continual ups and downs.

584
00:47:59,755 --> 00:48:02,922
- His pulse has weakened considerably.

585
00:48:05,576 --> 00:48:07,131
- He'll have to go back into trance

586
00:48:07,131 --> 00:48:08,753
for at least three hours.

587
00:48:08,753 --> 00:48:11,180
- Couldn't that be dangerous
with the voltage unsteady?

588
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:14,238
- Only the peak is fluctuating.

589
00:48:14,238 --> 00:48:16,905
Indeed, I need them quite badly.

590
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:21,079
- There's something else in all this.

591
00:48:21,079 --> 00:48:23,568
Something much more important

592
00:48:23,568 --> 00:48:26,337
than anything you've seen so far.

593
00:48:26,337 --> 00:48:30,504
Dr. Frankenstein sends
power from the other realm.

594
00:48:32,612 --> 00:48:33,445
- Power?

595
00:48:35,215 --> 00:48:38,481
- One that can accomplish great things.

596
00:48:38,481 --> 00:48:41,419
Dr. Frankenstein, before he died,

597
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:43,822
perfected a very startling theory

598
00:48:43,822 --> 00:48:48,138
which utilizes an
intermediary, a human brain,

599
00:48:48,138 --> 00:48:51,883
which is a connecting
link for transmission.

600
00:48:51,883 --> 00:48:55,300
- The brain is kept alive by low voltage?

601
00:48:56,814 --> 00:48:59,699
- It stays on an expanded threshold.

602
00:48:59,699 --> 00:49:01,898
A super-nourished state.

603
00:49:01,898 --> 00:49:05,805
- How can any of us forget
the great contribution he made

604
00:49:05,805 --> 00:49:07,888
by creating a human life?

605
00:49:09,389 --> 00:49:11,631
Even though it was a monster.

606
00:49:11,631 --> 00:49:12,866
- Yes.

607
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:16,528
Whatever happened to that creation?

608
00:49:16,528 --> 00:49:18,364
- In the years...

609
00:49:18,364 --> 00:49:23,364
Throughout the years the mind
of the monster never developed

610
00:49:25,001 --> 00:49:28,559
though his strength never ceased.

611
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:32,874
The strength paralleled
his great urge to destroy.

612
00:49:32,874 --> 00:49:37,026
We had to chain him to
the reef, underwater,

613
00:49:37,026 --> 00:49:38,614
beneath the grotto.

614
00:49:38,614 --> 00:49:41,614
(suspenseful music)

615
00:50:02,814 --> 00:50:06,192
- Hey, you know what I'd like to do?

616
00:50:06,192 --> 00:50:09,261
Grab all the air I can
and dive under the rock.

617
00:50:09,261 --> 00:50:10,279
- To where?

618
00:50:10,279 --> 00:50:11,582
- The ocean.

619
00:50:11,582 --> 00:50:12,415
The water's salty.

620
00:50:12,415 --> 00:50:15,006
That's where it's from.

621
00:50:15,006 --> 00:50:17,249
Boy, I wish I had some scuba gear.

622
00:50:17,249 --> 00:50:20,755
- When we pass this spot,
we keep right on going.

623
00:50:20,755 --> 00:50:21,588
- Yeah?

624
00:50:21,588 --> 00:50:22,505
Why's that?

625
00:50:24,176 --> 00:50:25,343
- I can't say.

626
00:50:26,496 --> 00:50:27,637
It's...

627
00:50:27,637 --> 00:50:29,184
I can't say.

628
00:50:29,184 --> 00:50:31,832
- (laughs) You know, that's
what I like about you.

629
00:50:31,832 --> 00:50:34,082
You never keep any secrets.

630
00:50:36,675 --> 00:50:37,508
Hey.

631
00:50:38,837 --> 00:50:41,670
That looks like a form down there.

632
00:50:42,785 --> 00:50:43,618
A human.

633
00:50:45,637 --> 00:50:48,220
Wow, there goes my imagination.

634
00:51:00,036 --> 00:51:03,053
- O disciple of the Golden Thread.

635
00:51:03,053 --> 00:51:05,534
The power ye seek shall be given.

636
00:51:05,534 --> 00:51:07,615
It shall be given.

637
00:51:07,615 --> 00:51:08,958
The power.

638
00:51:08,958 --> 00:51:10,506
The power.

639
00:51:10,506 --> 00:51:11,339
The power.

640
00:51:12,177 --> 00:51:13,010
The power.

641
00:51:15,877 --> 00:51:18,377
(tense music)

642
00:51:23,291 --> 00:51:25,874
(tone pulsing)

643
00:51:40,521 --> 00:51:43,688
(electricity zapping)

644
00:51:59,957 --> 00:52:02,774
O Celeste of the heavens.

645
00:52:02,774 --> 00:52:04,857
O horse within the light.

646
00:52:05,818 --> 00:52:10,512
I call for decrees in the
tradition we perpetuated.

647
00:52:10,512 --> 00:52:13,179
(tone warbling)

648
00:52:34,883 --> 00:52:37,568
- Looks like he can't move a muscle.

649
00:52:37,568 --> 00:52:38,951
- [Mark] Hey, Jayson.

650
00:52:38,951 --> 00:52:41,033
Jayson, listen to me.

651
00:52:41,033 --> 00:52:42,174
Come on, Jayson.

652
00:52:42,174 --> 00:52:44,208
Open your eyes.

653
00:52:44,208 --> 00:52:47,510
We want to help you, but
you've got to help us.

654
00:52:47,510 --> 00:52:48,843
Come on, Jayson.

655
00:52:52,927 --> 00:52:54,677
He was better before.

656
00:53:37,683 --> 00:53:40,350
(tones pulsing)

657
00:53:47,544 --> 00:53:49,334
- It's not necessary to eavesdrop.

658
00:53:49,334 --> 00:53:51,454
- Oh, you surprised us.

659
00:53:51,454 --> 00:53:52,961
- I would expect I had.

660
00:53:52,961 --> 00:53:54,437
That'll do.

661
00:53:54,437 --> 00:53:55,578
- We're just looking for Doc.

662
00:53:55,578 --> 00:53:56,839
We thought maybe.

663
00:53:56,839 --> 00:53:57,839
- Follow me.

664
00:54:08,567 --> 00:54:11,734
(electricity zapping)

665
00:54:22,683 --> 00:54:25,516
(machine beeping)

666
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:30,768
- Is he all right?

667
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:31,851
- Yeah, fine.

668
00:54:37,695 --> 00:54:39,815
- The raft's almost finished.

669
00:54:39,815 --> 00:54:40,648
- [Doc] Hmm?

670
00:54:40,648 --> 00:54:41,908
- The raft.

671
00:54:41,908 --> 00:54:45,812
By tonight it'll be
loaded and ready to go.

672
00:54:45,812 --> 00:54:47,145
- Wait a minute.

673
00:54:56,692 --> 00:54:59,175
- You know, Jayson feels bad.

674
00:54:59,175 --> 00:55:00,008
Looks bad.

675
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:03,330
Did you find anything to help him with?

676
00:55:03,330 --> 00:55:04,554
- To what?

677
00:55:04,554 --> 00:55:06,387
- Jayson, to help him.

678
00:55:08,336 --> 00:55:10,336
(gasps)

679
00:55:11,267 --> 00:55:13,022
- If this were dropped,

680
00:55:13,022 --> 00:55:15,912
we'd lose much more
than you could imagine.

681
00:55:15,912 --> 00:55:17,245
- Oh, I'm sorry.

682
00:55:18,272 --> 00:55:20,511
- Must your friends be here
at this particular time?

683
00:55:20,511 --> 00:55:22,223
I think they're taking advantage.

684
00:55:22,223 --> 00:55:23,056
- Yes.

685
00:55:23,056 --> 00:55:24,307
Yes, you're right.

686
00:55:24,307 --> 00:55:25,286
Now, look, Mark.

687
00:55:25,286 --> 00:55:26,836
It would be better if you wait outside.

688
00:55:26,836 --> 00:55:29,365
What I mean is, wait until tomorrow.

689
00:55:29,365 --> 00:55:32,378
We're in the middle here of
something very important.

690
00:55:32,378 --> 00:55:33,838
- Other things are important, too.

691
00:55:33,838 --> 00:55:35,443
- Look, I'm talking about life.

692
00:55:35,443 --> 00:55:36,663
Do you here me?

693
00:55:36,663 --> 00:55:37,496
Life.

694
00:55:38,456 --> 00:55:40,008
We may be on the verge of discovering

695
00:55:40,008 --> 00:55:42,901
the very factor that animates it.

696
00:55:42,901 --> 00:55:46,322
Have you any idea what that means?

697
00:55:46,322 --> 00:55:48,118
No, you wouldn't.

698
00:55:48,118 --> 00:55:50,234
You'd never understand.

699
00:55:50,234 --> 00:55:52,802
- Oh, I wouldn't, huh?

700
00:55:52,802 --> 00:55:55,653
- Mark, come back tomorrow.

701
00:55:55,653 --> 00:55:56,486
Please.

702
00:55:59,732 --> 00:56:00,565
- Sure.

703
00:56:17,938 --> 00:56:19,771
- Bring her over here.

704
00:56:35,659 --> 00:56:38,347
- She's the daughter of a strong woman

705
00:56:38,347 --> 00:56:41,851
with a parallel link to pure alien.

706
00:56:41,851 --> 00:56:42,684
- With her blood available,

707
00:56:42,684 --> 00:56:44,742
I don't know why you didn't
do this a long time ago.

708
00:56:44,742 --> 00:56:48,099
- Well, transfusing animal
blood with that of a human

709
00:56:48,099 --> 00:56:49,682
never seemed promising.

710
00:56:49,682 --> 00:56:52,332
In light of my husband's changes,

711
00:56:52,332 --> 00:56:54,787
the possibility was
never really considered.

712
00:56:54,787 --> 00:56:56,537
- Go get the animals.

713
00:57:02,489 --> 00:57:03,474
- [Mark] Hello.

714
00:57:03,474 --> 00:57:04,653
- Let's take a rest.

715
00:57:04,653 --> 00:57:05,509
Spread out.

716
00:57:05,509 --> 00:57:06,448
- What's the matter, something wrong?

717
00:57:06,448 --> 00:57:08,238
- Leone is missing.

718
00:57:08,238 --> 00:57:09,071
- Oh.

719
00:57:10,759 --> 00:57:13,448
- We found the tracks and one
set go deep into the ground.

720
00:57:13,448 --> 00:57:14,805
- Oh.

721
00:57:14,805 --> 00:57:15,888
- I'm sorry, Myra.

722
00:57:15,888 --> 00:57:16,781
- Let's just follow the tracks.

723
00:57:16,781 --> 00:57:17,972
- Why, sure.
- It's no use.

724
00:57:17,972 --> 00:57:18,848
- Wait a minute, we can help.

725
00:57:18,848 --> 00:57:19,681
The three of us can.

726
00:57:19,681 --> 00:57:20,725
- There's nothing that can be done.

727
00:57:20,725 --> 00:57:21,864
Not now.

728
00:57:21,864 --> 00:57:23,742
Two sets of tracks means he won't weaken

729
00:57:23,742 --> 00:57:25,658
the way he does when he's alone.

730
00:57:25,658 --> 00:57:28,378
That happens when they want
one of us for an experiment.

731
00:57:28,378 --> 00:57:29,211
- Oh.

732
00:57:31,108 --> 00:57:32,493
Hey, wait a minute.

733
00:57:32,493 --> 00:57:33,554
I'll tell you what we'll do.

734
00:57:33,554 --> 00:57:35,063
Tonight, when it gets dark,

735
00:57:35,063 --> 00:57:38,896
we'll go back there
together, all of us, okay?

736
00:57:47,326 --> 00:57:49,239
(crying)

737
00:57:49,239 --> 00:57:51,319
- This kind of thing happen very often?

738
00:57:51,319 --> 00:57:52,319
- Sometimes.

739
00:57:54,136 --> 00:57:56,661
- Well, you've gotta set
up some kind of protection.

740
00:57:56,661 --> 00:58:01,494
You know, like deep pits in
the ground covered with grass.

741
00:58:03,307 --> 00:58:04,590
- Yes, but.

742
00:58:04,590 --> 00:58:07,171
(subdued music)

743
00:58:07,171 --> 00:58:08,004
- Come on.

744
00:58:08,004 --> 00:58:09,494
Maybe we'll be able to bring her back.

745
00:58:09,494 --> 00:58:10,411
- We won't.

746
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:22,432
- There.

747
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:26,349
Now you've been adopted into the tribe.

748
00:58:26,349 --> 00:58:28,504
- [Girl] He was a long time ago.

749
00:58:28,504 --> 00:58:29,337
Adopted.

750
00:58:30,457 --> 00:58:32,290
I'm going to miss him.

751
00:58:33,299 --> 00:58:35,132
- He's gonna miss you.

752
00:58:35,992 --> 00:58:38,492
He's gonna miss you very much.

753
00:58:50,254 --> 00:58:52,504
(laughing)

754
00:59:00,501 --> 00:59:02,278
- Did you touch...

755
00:59:02,278 --> 00:59:03,664
Touch the bottle?

756
00:59:03,664 --> 00:59:07,031
- I hardly have time, but, well.

757
00:59:07,031 --> 00:59:08,736
(yells)

758
00:59:08,736 --> 00:59:10,246
- Mate, mate.

759
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:11,079
Now, mate.

760
00:59:13,293 --> 00:59:14,756
- Wasn't a bad drink.

761
00:59:14,756 --> 00:59:19,434
By the way, don't lag behind
on that embalming powder.

762
00:59:19,434 --> 00:59:21,466
Twice an hour, she said.

763
00:59:21,466 --> 00:59:23,705
Until the autopsy.

764
00:59:23,705 --> 00:59:25,382
- Embalming powder.

765
00:59:25,382 --> 00:59:26,215
- Yeah.

766
00:59:29,085 --> 00:59:29,918
- Yes.

767
00:59:29,918 --> 00:59:31,669
- All right.

768
00:59:31,669 --> 00:59:32,836
- I can, mate.

769
00:59:46,437 --> 00:59:48,687
(laughing)

770
00:59:50,909 --> 00:59:52,992
Make room for the bottle.

771
00:59:54,086 --> 00:59:56,336
(laughing)

772
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:02,021
- I don't know how many
more of these they want,

773
01:00:02,021 --> 01:00:05,065
but I'm not gonna chase any
more like I did this one.

774
01:00:05,065 --> 01:00:06,065
- Oh, laddy.

775
01:00:08,699 --> 01:00:11,508
You're just sorry
because this is a bummer.

776
01:00:11,508 --> 01:00:14,809
You wanted him for Sunday dinner.

777
01:00:14,809 --> 01:00:17,059
(laughing)

778
01:00:26,883 --> 01:00:29,540
(machine beeping)

779
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:31,957
- Wish we could've saved her.

780
01:00:39,168 --> 01:00:40,722
- How's the pulse?

781
01:00:40,722 --> 01:00:41,555
- Strong.

782
01:00:45,327 --> 01:00:46,670
- Let's increase the voltage.

783
01:00:46,670 --> 01:00:47,524
- No, no, no.

784
01:00:47,524 --> 01:00:49,607
I think it's high enough.

785
01:00:59,010 --> 01:01:01,088
- What do you think?

786
01:01:01,088 --> 01:01:02,068
- Uh, no.

787
01:01:02,068 --> 01:01:02,901
No more.

788
01:01:04,597 --> 01:01:06,832
- No more animals will be needed.

789
01:01:06,832 --> 01:01:09,479
I'll let you know if there's a change.

790
01:01:09,479 --> 01:01:11,646
Take this girl's body out.

791
01:01:23,485 --> 01:01:25,604
- His eyes are fluttering.

792
01:01:25,604 --> 01:01:28,021
Break out the secondary coil.

793
01:01:35,201 --> 01:01:37,784
(tone pulsing)

794
01:01:48,235 --> 01:01:49,170
Good.

795
01:01:49,170 --> 01:01:50,308
All right.

796
01:01:50,308 --> 01:01:53,641
Ease the primary back between 18 and 20.

797
01:02:09,859 --> 01:02:10,692
Slowly.

798
01:02:10,692 --> 01:02:11,692
Very slowly.

799
01:02:15,725 --> 01:02:16,744
Good, good.

800
01:02:16,744 --> 01:02:17,744
Is it at 18?

801
01:02:19,063 --> 01:02:19,896
- 22.

802
01:02:21,301 --> 01:02:22,134
21.

803
01:02:23,261 --> 01:02:24,094
20.

804
01:02:25,136 --> 01:02:25,969
19.

805
01:02:27,662 --> 01:02:28,886
- Okay, full power.

806
01:02:28,886 --> 01:02:29,719
All of it.

807
01:02:30,897 --> 01:02:33,397
(tense music)

808
01:03:21,685 --> 01:03:22,852
That's enough!

809
01:03:33,165 --> 01:03:33,998
Easy now.

810
01:03:33,998 --> 01:03:34,831
Relax.

811
01:03:35,933 --> 01:03:37,350
- Try some water.

812
01:03:44,242 --> 01:03:45,222
(sighs)

813
01:03:45,222 --> 01:03:46,055
- There.

814
01:03:46,055 --> 01:03:47,054
How do you feel?

815
01:03:47,054 --> 01:03:47,887
- Strong.

816
01:03:48,967 --> 01:03:50,026
Very much so.

817
01:03:50,026 --> 01:03:51,078
- [Doc] Good.

818
01:03:51,078 --> 01:03:53,155
- We've done it.

819
01:03:53,155 --> 01:03:55,355
I think we've really done it.

820
01:03:55,355 --> 01:03:56,576
- Done what?

821
01:03:56,576 --> 01:03:58,937
- Found a blood supply that'll hold.

822
01:03:58,937 --> 01:04:02,803
If it sustains the way I think
it will, it'll be permanent.

823
01:04:02,803 --> 01:04:06,489
Why, you've never balanced
as quickly as this.

824
01:04:06,489 --> 01:04:09,903
- What may I ask did you transfuse?

825
01:04:09,903 --> 01:04:12,722
- We funneled fresh
hematitis by one quarter pint

826
01:04:12,722 --> 01:04:16,555
for every full one received
from one of your alien girls.

827
01:04:16,555 --> 01:04:18,427
- Animal blood?

828
01:04:18,427 --> 01:04:20,706
Are you saying that you
gave me animal blood?

829
01:04:20,706 --> 01:04:22,336
- With a slow entry rate,

830
01:04:22,336 --> 01:04:26,175
the body itself homogenizes the two types.

831
01:04:26,175 --> 01:04:27,924
- Whose idea was this?

832
01:04:27,924 --> 01:04:28,818
- Well, mine.

833
01:04:28,818 --> 01:04:29,651
I thought that.

834
01:04:29,651 --> 01:04:31,383
- You thought?

835
01:04:31,383 --> 01:04:34,159
If you'd really thought you
would have looked in my journals

836
01:04:34,159 --> 01:04:36,475
and found out that we
had tried this concept

837
01:04:36,475 --> 01:04:38,835
before you were born.

838
01:04:38,835 --> 01:04:40,180
It almost ended me.

839
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:41,793
- [Doc] We'll drain it immediately.

840
01:04:41,793 --> 01:04:43,376
- I'll need type A.

841
01:04:44,443 --> 01:04:46,943
That means the captain Jayson.

842
01:04:48,513 --> 01:04:51,818
You'll have to start
the transfusion slowly.

843
01:04:51,818 --> 01:04:53,369
Don't rush.

844
01:04:53,369 --> 01:04:56,952
But gradually pick up
time as you progress.

845
01:05:04,313 --> 01:05:06,138
- The 12 rang.

846
01:05:06,138 --> 01:05:08,293
The Golden Thread.

847
01:05:08,293 --> 01:05:10,617
Ye shall have its power.

848
01:05:10,617 --> 01:05:12,122
Its power.

849
01:05:12,122 --> 01:05:13,610
Its power.

850
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:14,443
Its power.

851
01:05:15,447 --> 01:05:20,447
♪ I know where the four winds blow ♪

852
01:05:22,161 --> 01:05:27,161
♪ And the good always goes ♪

853
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:36,570
♪ But when the ship sinks ♪

854
01:05:36,570 --> 01:05:39,590
♪ There's no place to go ♪

855
01:05:39,590 --> 01:05:41,673
(laughs)

856
01:05:44,555 --> 01:05:45,388
What?

857
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:28,480
- O disciples, the power awaits you.

858
01:06:30,450 --> 01:06:32,733
Ye will have all that ye wish.

859
01:06:32,733 --> 01:06:34,652
All that ye wish.

860
01:06:34,652 --> 01:06:37,235
I give the power of the thread.

861
01:06:50,299 --> 01:06:52,799
(tense music)

862
01:08:08,675 --> 01:08:11,008
(screaming)

863
01:08:40,479 --> 01:08:41,578
- Get down.

864
01:08:41,578 --> 01:08:43,696
- I couldn't see in the lab,
but I heard them talking.

865
01:08:43,696 --> 01:08:45,365
They've got Jayson there, all right.

866
01:08:45,365 --> 01:08:47,360
They're taking his blood.

867
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:48,193
- Down.

868
01:08:54,654 --> 01:08:57,135
That's the fourth one I've seen tonight.

869
01:08:57,135 --> 01:08:59,377
- Don't they cut down on the night shift?

870
01:08:59,377 --> 01:09:02,837
- Cut down is right and
I'm gonna do the cutting.

871
01:09:02,837 --> 01:09:04,020
- Come again?

872
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:05,443
- Machine guns.

873
01:09:05,443 --> 01:09:06,585
Remember what she said?

874
01:09:06,585 --> 01:09:08,867
The only to handle these
guys is with machine guns.

875
01:09:08,867 --> 01:09:09,700
- Yeah.

876
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:11,235
Cut 'em right down the middle.

877
01:09:11,235 --> 01:09:12,818
Got a couple on ya?

878
01:09:14,738 --> 01:09:16,041
- She wouldn't have mentioned it

879
01:09:16,041 --> 01:09:18,360
if there wasn't at least one
of them around here somewhere.

880
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:21,860
Now my guess is there's one in that house.

881
01:09:23,364 --> 01:09:24,626
Do you know what a machine gun looks like?

882
01:09:24,626 --> 01:09:26,496
- Um, I think so.

883
01:09:26,496 --> 01:09:27,765
- Oh.

884
01:09:27,765 --> 01:09:29,046
They're about this long, you know.

885
01:09:29,046 --> 01:09:30,060
They shoot bullets.

886
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:30,893
- Come on.

887
01:09:39,387 --> 01:09:42,387
(suspenseful music)

888
01:10:41,772 --> 01:10:43,281
- Here.

889
01:10:43,281 --> 01:10:44,789
It's a machine gun, all right.

890
01:10:44,789 --> 01:10:46,785
Looks like out of Civil War.

891
01:10:46,785 --> 01:10:47,762
- Good.

892
01:10:47,762 --> 01:10:49,312
Just so it works.

893
01:10:49,312 --> 01:10:50,145
- Yeah.

894
01:11:04,949 --> 01:11:08,332
(dramatic music)

895
01:11:08,332 --> 01:11:10,939
(screams)

896
01:11:10,939 --> 01:11:11,772
- Dino!

897
01:11:14,648 --> 01:11:16,815
(screams)

898
01:11:22,956 --> 01:11:24,873
- I'll need more blood.

899
01:11:26,215 --> 01:11:27,173
- Easy.

900
01:11:27,173 --> 01:11:28,332
- I can.

901
01:11:28,332 --> 01:11:29,356
- Slowly now.

902
01:11:29,356 --> 01:11:30,439
Take it easy.

903
01:11:35,352 --> 01:11:36,710
- What are you doing?

904
01:11:36,710 --> 01:11:38,381
I didn't call for anyone else.

905
01:11:38,381 --> 01:11:39,548
Take her away.

906
01:11:40,983 --> 01:11:41,816
No, wait.

907
01:11:43,629 --> 01:11:47,414
She'll do for the second transfusion.

908
01:11:47,414 --> 01:11:48,414
- [Girl] No!

909
01:11:55,844 --> 01:11:56,677
No.

910
01:12:07,592 --> 01:12:09,262
- [Jayson] You are.

911
01:12:09,262 --> 01:12:10,845
You are, I know it.

912
01:12:12,726 --> 01:12:14,071
Oh, my god.

913
01:12:14,071 --> 01:12:14,904
My god.

914
01:12:16,597 --> 01:12:17,430
- What?

915
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:20,828
- Oh, God.

916
01:12:20,828 --> 01:12:21,661
Oh, God.

917
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:30,041
You're the perfect image of my wife.

918
01:12:30,041 --> 01:12:32,291
Of my dear, my poor Lenore.

919
01:12:35,266 --> 01:12:38,016
You're the absolute image of her.

920
01:12:39,787 --> 01:12:42,037
She was killed 17 years ago

921
01:12:44,192 --> 01:12:46,681
when the ship hit the reef

922
01:12:46,681 --> 01:12:49,608
and you were cushioned in my arms.

923
01:12:49,608 --> 01:12:51,157
- Me?

924
01:12:51,157 --> 01:12:54,621
- Cushioned in my arms
when you were three.

925
01:12:54,621 --> 01:12:55,538
Only three.

926
01:12:57,393 --> 01:12:58,785
Don't you remember?

927
01:12:58,785 --> 01:13:00,254
- Me?

928
01:13:00,254 --> 01:13:01,638
- Who sang to you?

929
01:13:01,638 --> 01:13:03,636
I sang to you.

930
01:13:03,636 --> 01:13:06,486
Who told you the story of the seas,

931
01:13:06,486 --> 01:13:09,542
of the continents of the
world, the story of Noah?

932
01:13:09,542 --> 01:13:10,969
Don't you remember?

933
01:13:10,969 --> 01:13:12,049
Think, child.

934
01:13:12,049 --> 01:13:12,882
Don't you?

935
01:13:12,882 --> 01:13:13,715
- Yes.

936
01:13:13,715 --> 01:13:14,548
- [Jayson] No, ma'am.

937
01:13:14,548 --> 01:13:15,381
Please, don't do that.

938
01:13:15,381 --> 01:13:16,214
- [Girl] No!

939
01:13:16,214 --> 01:13:17,047
- [Jayson] No, don't do it!

940
01:13:17,047 --> 01:13:17,880
Take some of mine.

941
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:19,025
More of mine.

942
01:13:19,025 --> 01:13:20,657
Take mine!

943
01:13:20,657 --> 01:13:21,762
Mine!

944
01:13:21,762 --> 01:13:24,845
(machine gun firing)

945
01:14:00,471 --> 01:14:01,735
- Get him by the wall.

946
01:14:01,735 --> 01:14:02,735
To the side.

947
01:14:12,727 --> 01:14:13,560
Hurry up.

948
01:14:17,657 --> 01:14:18,797
All right, everybody.

949
01:14:18,797 --> 01:14:20,951
Let's get ourselves relaxed and friendly

950
01:14:20,951 --> 01:14:23,068
and we'll have no problems.

951
01:14:23,068 --> 01:14:25,591
Doc, they're gonna crash
that door any minute.

952
01:14:25,591 --> 01:14:27,587
Get over here with us.

953
01:14:27,587 --> 01:14:29,261
- I think you've lost your mind.

954
01:14:29,261 --> 01:14:33,187
Better stop this nonsense
before you ruin everything.

955
01:14:33,187 --> 01:14:35,670
- Oh, I've lost my mind, huh?

956
01:14:35,670 --> 01:14:36,606
You know, Doc.

957
01:14:36,606 --> 01:14:38,481
I always knew you were a comic.

958
01:14:38,481 --> 01:14:40,814
Dino, check out the old man.

959
01:14:42,402 --> 01:14:43,235
- Dino.

960
01:14:55,081 --> 01:14:55,976
- Please.

961
01:14:55,976 --> 01:14:58,976
If he doesn't have blood, he'll die.

962
01:15:00,985 --> 01:15:02,818
- Well, whose blood would you like?

963
01:15:02,818 --> 01:15:04,050
Would you like Dino's?

964
01:15:04,050 --> 01:15:05,300
How about mine?

965
01:15:06,790 --> 01:15:08,671
- This man worked with Dr. Frankenstein.

966
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:10,501
He's the link that can...

967
01:15:10,501 --> 01:15:13,674
Look, we'll take just one
pint from each of them.

968
01:15:13,674 --> 01:15:15,344
He's a great man.

969
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:17,751
Save him for science.

970
01:15:17,751 --> 01:15:19,543
- You may not know it, Doc,

971
01:15:19,543 --> 01:15:22,314
but that's exactly what
I'm trying to do for you.

972
01:15:22,314 --> 01:15:23,494
- That door's gonna go!

973
01:15:23,494 --> 01:15:25,691
(banging on door)

974
01:15:25,691 --> 01:15:28,704
- What chance do you
really think you have?

975
01:15:28,704 --> 01:15:30,781
- Against them?

976
01:15:30,781 --> 01:15:31,770
I've cut five of 'em to pieces

977
01:15:31,770 --> 01:15:34,415
and I'm just waiting for the rest.

978
01:15:34,415 --> 01:15:37,922
For what it's worth, we
bolted your outside door.

979
01:15:37,922 --> 01:15:40,203
Those guys are too dumb
to come in the window.

980
01:15:40,203 --> 01:15:41,036
- Look, Mark.

981
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:43,379
You're doing what I expect you
to, and I know you mean well,

982
01:15:43,379 --> 01:15:46,353
but this is something
out of your experience.

983
01:15:46,353 --> 01:15:49,504
If you had any idea about
the science we're after,

984
01:15:49,504 --> 01:15:51,379
what they're really doing,

985
01:15:51,379 --> 01:15:52,886
you'd see the mistake in your thinking.

986
01:15:52,886 --> 01:15:53,719
- Be careful!

987
01:15:53,719 --> 01:15:54,886
Don't bump it!

988
01:15:55,901 --> 01:15:59,818
- Mark, its value is more
than you can imagine.

989
01:16:03,802 --> 01:16:05,717
- Look, what do you think?

990
01:16:05,717 --> 01:16:08,967
Maybe it's the brain we should destroy.

991
01:16:10,281 --> 01:16:13,448
(electricity zapping)

992
01:17:03,211 --> 01:17:05,085
- I hear thee.

993
01:17:05,085 --> 01:17:06,835
One so close, I hear.

994
01:17:08,210 --> 01:17:10,793
Though as I hear, be reassured.

995
01:17:11,752 --> 01:17:14,002
My response is forthcoming.

996
01:17:19,075 --> 01:17:21,719
O Celeste of the heavens.

997
01:17:21,719 --> 01:17:23,802
O horse within the light.

998
01:17:24,816 --> 01:17:29,816
I call for a decree in the
tradition we perpetuated.

999
01:17:29,872 --> 01:17:34,205
Grant upon this night, the
created one becomes full.

1000
01:17:35,089 --> 01:17:36,422
That he be free.

1001
01:17:37,964 --> 01:17:39,797
Grant that he be free.

1002
01:17:41,381 --> 01:17:45,214
And behest the name of
Frankenstein to endure.

1003
01:17:47,492 --> 01:17:49,992
(tense music)

1004
01:18:00,318 --> 01:18:05,235
Upon the name of the Golden
Thread, ye shall have strength.

1005
01:18:09,323 --> 01:18:10,156
Strength.

1006
01:18:11,237 --> 01:18:15,065
Strength upon the name
of the Golden Thread.

1007
01:18:15,065 --> 01:18:17,348
Ye shall have strength.

1008
01:18:17,348 --> 01:18:19,265
Ye shall have strength.

1009
01:18:22,421 --> 01:18:25,088
(ominous music)

1010
01:18:30,941 --> 01:18:33,691
(dramatic music)

1011
01:18:41,185 --> 01:18:42,730
- Mark, I want you to listen to me.

1012
01:18:42,730 --> 01:18:44,686
We've been friends a long time.

1013
01:18:44,686 --> 01:18:47,413
Now, you owe something to that friendship.

1014
01:18:47,413 --> 01:18:48,552
- No, Doc.

1015
01:18:48,552 --> 01:18:49,731
If you were yourself,

1016
01:18:49,731 --> 01:18:52,257
you wouldn't be asking me
to do anything different.

1017
01:18:52,257 --> 01:18:54,413
They've been feeding you
dope ever since you got here.

1018
01:18:54,413 --> 01:18:56,854
- You're psyched out, Doc,
and you don't know it.

1019
01:18:56,854 --> 01:18:59,379
- Please, I'm begging you.

1020
01:18:59,379 --> 01:19:01,100
Don't do this.

1021
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:03,055
- Madam, I'm doing nothing.

1022
01:19:03,055 --> 01:19:06,805
And I might add, so are
you and your husband.

1023
01:19:08,957 --> 01:19:11,157
- I'll release your friend.

1024
01:19:11,157 --> 01:19:13,907
(dramatic music)

1025
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:17,600
(growling)

1026
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:33,127
(electricity zapping)

1027
01:20:08,192 --> 01:20:10,442
(laughing)

1028
01:20:15,336 --> 01:20:17,025
(tense music)

1029
01:20:17,025 --> 01:20:19,942
(thunder crashing)

1030
01:20:58,656 --> 01:21:01,489
(Melvin whimpers)

1031
01:21:54,823 --> 01:21:57,073
(laughing)

1032
01:21:58,974 --> 01:22:01,807
(thunder crashes)

1033
01:22:17,914 --> 01:22:19,993
- He's all right now.

1034
01:22:19,993 --> 01:22:22,157
How do you feel, Doc?

1035
01:22:22,157 --> 01:22:23,735
- Like I've been asleep.

1036
01:22:23,735 --> 01:22:24,954
(laughs)

1037
01:22:24,954 --> 01:22:26,465
- We've lost far too much time.

1038
01:22:26,465 --> 01:22:28,137
Get the girl ready for the transfusion.

1039
01:22:28,137 --> 01:22:31,351
- Whoa, I didn't promise
anything about that.

1040
01:22:31,351 --> 01:22:32,544
- You certainly implied it.

1041
01:22:32,544 --> 01:22:35,155
You indicated that if my husband
would cooperate, you'd see.

1042
01:22:35,155 --> 01:22:35,988
- Wait a minute.

1043
01:22:35,988 --> 01:22:36,821
Wait, wait.

1044
01:22:36,821 --> 01:22:38,417
I'm the correct blood type.

1045
01:22:38,417 --> 01:22:39,436
I'll donate two pints.

1046
01:22:39,436 --> 01:22:41,102
(door clatters)

1047
01:22:41,102 --> 01:22:43,852
(dramatic music)

1048
01:22:46,327 --> 01:22:47,494
- It's jammed!

1049
01:23:12,648 --> 01:23:14,898
(grunting)

1050
01:23:34,293 --> 01:23:36,460
(gasping)

1051
01:24:33,334 --> 01:24:36,084
(Melvin barking)

1052
01:24:48,380 --> 01:24:50,630
(growling)

1053
01:25:11,345 --> 01:25:14,095
(glass shatters)

1054
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:38,180
(tone pulses)

1055
01:26:19,138 --> 01:26:22,055
(shelf clattering)

1056
01:26:36,132 --> 01:26:39,465
- The brain, it's going to be destroyed.

1057
01:26:41,307 --> 01:26:42,474
- Don't worry.

1058
01:26:43,994 --> 01:26:46,279
If the brain is damaged,

1059
01:26:46,279 --> 01:26:50,023
another one will activate in seconds.

1060
01:26:50,023 --> 01:26:52,916
The power will start again.

1061
01:26:52,916 --> 01:26:56,999
A backup brain was hidden
years ago just in case.

1062
01:27:27,654 --> 01:27:29,157
- Now's your chance to go.

1063
01:27:29,157 --> 01:27:29,990
- Go?

1064
01:27:29,990 --> 01:27:31,802
- Take the raft and go.

1065
01:27:31,802 --> 01:27:33,798
Now you have a chance,
but only for a minute.

1066
01:27:33,798 --> 01:27:34,734
- What are you talking about?

1067
01:27:34,734 --> 01:27:37,012
- I overheard them discussing it.

1068
01:27:37,012 --> 01:27:39,215
When the brain was
damaged, the power stopped.

1069
01:27:39,215 --> 01:27:41,746
But there's another
brain hidden somewhere.

1070
01:27:41,746 --> 01:27:44,724
It'll activate any minute and
they'll all be strong again.

1071
01:27:44,724 --> 01:27:45,557
- She's right.

1072
01:27:45,557 --> 01:27:47,640
We could bring back help.

1073
01:28:01,136 --> 01:28:01,969
- [Dino] Come on.

1074
01:28:01,969 --> 01:28:03,210
We're getting out.

1075
01:28:03,210 --> 01:28:04,043
- He can't move.

1076
01:28:04,043 --> 01:28:05,079
It's impossible.

1077
01:28:05,079 --> 01:28:07,282
He's barely alive.

1078
01:28:07,282 --> 01:28:08,115
- [Dino] Then you come.

1079
01:28:08,115 --> 01:28:08,948
- I can't.

1080
01:28:10,117 --> 01:28:11,367
He's my father.

1081
01:28:12,414 --> 01:28:13,515
- [Doc] Dino, come on.

1082
01:28:13,515 --> 01:28:14,657
We've gotta go.

1083
01:28:14,657 --> 01:28:15,824
Dino, come on.

1084
01:28:16,695 --> 01:28:17,754
- [Dino] We'll come back for ya.

1085
01:28:17,754 --> 01:28:19,671
We'll come back for ya.

1086
01:28:32,851 --> 01:28:35,679
- The thing just got
more and more fantastic

1087
01:28:35,679 --> 01:28:38,406
as the situations were developing.

1088
01:28:38,406 --> 01:28:41,480
You see, at first, I thought
we were in the hands of people

1089
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:44,660
that would understand
and give us some help.

1090
01:28:44,660 --> 01:28:47,347
- It's hard to believe with all
that sophisticated equipment

1091
01:28:47,347 --> 01:28:50,319
that they wouldn't try
some kind of radio contact.

1092
01:28:50,319 --> 01:28:52,355
- It became obvious that
everything about them

1093
01:28:52,355 --> 01:28:54,231
was out of step.

1094
01:28:54,231 --> 01:28:57,328
And you must realize that
we had no alternative

1095
01:28:57,328 --> 01:29:01,030
except to keep our heads and
look for every opportunity.

1096
01:29:01,030 --> 01:29:03,559
- And you didn't pull that
one off very well neither.

1097
01:29:03,559 --> 01:29:04,392
- I know, but.

1098
01:29:04,392 --> 01:29:05,921
- Colonel, what I'd like to know is

1099
01:29:05,921 --> 01:29:08,283
who has jurisdiction
over something like this?

1100
01:29:08,283 --> 01:29:09,260
- Nobody.

1101
01:29:09,260 --> 01:29:11,618
It's a friendly island.

1102
01:29:11,618 --> 01:29:13,939
- [Mark] Oh, that's wonderful.

1103
01:29:13,939 --> 01:29:16,425
- Now, when you say that a
man is being held prisoner

1104
01:29:16,425 --> 01:29:18,382
and he might be an American.

1105
01:29:18,382 --> 01:29:20,416
Now, if you're mistaken in that,

1106
01:29:20,416 --> 01:29:22,588
that could bring about
some kind of embarrassment.

1107
01:29:22,588 --> 01:29:24,256
- Oh, there's no mistake.

1108
01:29:24,256 --> 01:29:26,909
I only wish there was.

1109
01:29:26,909 --> 01:29:28,948
- Tell you very frankly.

1110
01:29:28,948 --> 01:29:32,736
If I didn't know I was hearing
this from the horse's mouth,

1111
01:29:32,736 --> 01:29:37,153
I'd check my communications
for a big hole somewhere.

1112
01:29:38,436 --> 01:29:40,920
- You're just gonna have
to see it for yourself.

1113
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:41,900
- See for myself?

1114
01:29:41,900 --> 01:29:42,914
- [Doc] Mm-hmm.

1115
01:29:42,914 --> 01:29:44,350
- Colonel, I'm very sorry,

1116
01:29:44,350 --> 01:29:47,446
but I realize that this
sounds like it's a, uh.

1117
01:29:47,446 --> 01:29:49,154
- Paperback, huh?

1118
01:29:49,154 --> 01:29:49,987
- Well.

1119
01:29:53,917 --> 01:29:56,584
- I cannot brush off the reality

1120
01:29:57,706 --> 01:30:00,206
of that raft that you were on.

1121
01:30:01,042 --> 01:30:03,042
Those logs are tangible.

1122
01:30:04,262 --> 01:30:07,599
Obviously, rooted to the ground.

1123
01:30:07,599 --> 01:30:09,841
- And the ground is there,
just like I told you.

1124
01:30:09,841 --> 01:30:11,348
And if it hadn't been for those logs,

1125
01:30:11,348 --> 01:30:13,305
we wouldn't have gotten any place.

1126
01:30:13,305 --> 01:30:17,665
And believe me, that's
something I'm very thankful for.

1127
01:30:17,665 --> 01:30:20,248
- So much has happened, really,

1128
01:30:21,288 --> 01:30:24,060
that the mind can't catalog it.

1129
01:30:24,060 --> 01:30:26,710
But the one thing on top
is we gotta get back there

1130
01:30:26,710 --> 01:30:29,806
and without losing any more time.

1131
01:30:29,806 --> 01:30:33,223
- Get an okay from Manila this afternoon.

1132
01:30:40,024 --> 01:30:42,774
(dramatic music)

1133
01:31:28,934 --> 01:31:29,851
- What the?

1134
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:38,662
- I don't know why, but
the girls' huts are gone.

1135
01:31:38,662 --> 01:31:40,871
They were right there.

1136
01:31:40,871 --> 01:31:41,704
- Come on.

1137
01:31:45,799 --> 01:31:46,632
- Melvin?

1138
01:32:03,795 --> 01:32:04,628
Melvin!

1139
01:32:25,179 --> 01:32:26,929
- I don't believe it.

1140
01:32:29,377 --> 01:32:32,127
(dramatic music)

1141
01:32:34,104 --> 01:32:34,937
- Well?

1142
01:32:38,586 --> 01:32:40,381
- The house, the laboratory.

1143
01:32:40,381 --> 01:32:42,964
They've completely disappeared.

1144
01:32:44,537 --> 01:32:45,704
- Disappeared?

1145
01:32:46,937 --> 01:32:47,854
- Holy cow.

1146
01:32:52,679 --> 01:32:54,430
- So that's your story.

1147
01:32:54,430 --> 01:32:57,482
The house was there, but
it's not there any more.

1148
01:32:57,482 --> 01:32:58,315
- Right.

1149
01:32:59,889 --> 01:33:01,557
- Well, we might as well wrap this up

1150
01:33:01,557 --> 01:33:02,451
as quickly as possible.

1151
01:33:02,451 --> 01:33:04,162
- Wait a minute.

1152
01:33:04,162 --> 01:33:05,303
You're not gonna leave us.

1153
01:33:05,303 --> 01:33:06,646
Just walk away from it?

1154
01:33:06,646 --> 01:33:08,070
- Just walk away.

1155
01:33:08,070 --> 01:33:12,307
It's clear you hallucinated
the whole thing.

1156
01:33:12,307 --> 01:33:13,557
- Hallucinated?

1157
01:33:31,190 --> 01:33:33,857
(subdued music)

1158
01:33:44,519 --> 01:33:45,769
- Hallucinated.

1159
01:33:46,718 --> 01:33:48,106
- All four of us.

1160
01:33:48,106 --> 01:33:49,532
- That's ridiculous.

1161
01:33:49,532 --> 01:33:51,613
How can all four of us
hallucinate the same thing?

1162
01:33:51,613 --> 01:33:53,484
- Aw, it's nuts.

1163
01:33:53,484 --> 01:33:55,519
Now, answer me, Doc.

1164
01:33:55,519 --> 01:33:59,103
How can four grown men,
four different minds,

1165
01:33:59,103 --> 01:34:02,727
go through all of this and
it just had to go up and.

1166
01:34:02,727 --> 01:34:04,071
(Melvin barks)

1167
01:34:04,071 --> 01:34:04,904
- Hey!

1168
01:34:11,083 --> 01:34:12,345
Melvin.

1169
01:34:12,345 --> 01:34:13,178
Ah.

1170
01:34:16,333 --> 01:34:18,416
Hey, where are you going?

1171
01:34:48,345 --> 01:34:49,178
- Oh.

1172
01:35:17,719 --> 01:35:20,469
(sweeping music)
