1
00:00:46,756 --> 00:00:49,805
There is a place.

2
00:00:49,968 --> 00:00:53,268
A place that knows no sadness.

3
00:00:53,888 --> 00:00:58,234
Where even feeling blue is a happy thing.

4
00:00:58,935 --> 00:01:04,863
A place inhabited by little blue beings
three apples high.

5
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:11,748
It lies deep in an enchanted forest,
hidden away beyond a medieval village.

6
00:01:11,823 --> 00:01:14,918
Most people believe this place is made up,

7
00:01:14,993 --> 00:01:19,590
only to be found in books
or in children's imaginations.

8
00:01:19,664 --> 00:01:22,634
Well, we beg to differ.

9
00:01:23,668 --> 00:01:26,342
Yeah! Come on, Farmer!

10
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,593
I'm going in!

11
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:36,181
All right, Greedy, I'm gonna race you!

12
00:01:36,347 --> 00:01:37,815
Yes!

13
00:01:39,142 --> 00:01:45,866
Whoa, golly! Farm boys love to fly!

14
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,448
Oh, yeah! So excited!

15
00:01:57,035 --> 00:02:00,630
Now you see us, now you don't!

16
00:02:00,705 --> 00:02:04,050
Three, two, one. Yeah!

17
00:02:18,723 --> 00:02:22,728
Yeah! I love smurf berries! Hey, hey!
The blue ones are mine!

18
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:37,242
Oh, no! I'm late for rehearsal! I am so late!

19
00:02:37,367 --> 00:02:42,419
In Smurf village, each and every Smurf
plays their own special pad.

20
00:02:42,914 --> 00:02:45,008
- Whoa, Nellie!
- Sorry, Handy!

21
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:48,178
No problem, Clumsy. You keep me employed!

22
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:50,630
Which gives the Smurfs a sense of harmony.

23
00:02:50,755 --> 00:02:53,008
- Hey, Baker! Nice pies!
- No worries, Clumsy.

24
00:02:53,091 --> 00:02:55,560
- And tranquility.
- Great sign, guys!

25
00:02:55,635 --> 00:02:58,138
- Whether it's Handy Smurf the builder
- I can't stay. Rehearsal time!

26
00:02:58,262 --> 00:03:00,640
- Baker Smurf.
- Hey, Narrator Smurf!

27
00:03:00,765 --> 00:03:04,645
Hello, Clumsy! Just rehearsing the intro
for the Blue Moon Festival!

28
00:03:04,936 --> 00:03:07,234
- Pizza!
- Pardon me! Pardon me! Hey, Chef Smurf!

29
00:03:07,313 --> 00:03:09,987
Clumsy! Help!

30
00:03:11,317 --> 00:03:15,413
I just invented frozen pizzas! Genius!

31
00:03:16,406 --> 00:03:17,703
Smurf on the loose!

32
00:03:17,782 --> 00:03:19,079
- Hey, Clumsy.
- Hey, guys!

33
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:20,785
- Hi, Jokey!
- Hi, Clumsy.

34
00:03:22,078 --> 00:03:23,625
Who's clumsy now, huh?

35
00:03:23,746 --> 00:03:26,625
Hey, what do you get when you cross
a Smurf with a cow?

36
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:30,550
Blue cheese! I got you a present.

37
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:32,972
No, thanks, Jokey. I'm late for rehearsal!

38
00:03:33,089 --> 00:03:34,966
But, wait! I...

39
00:03:39,095 --> 00:03:40,642
Hey, Grouchy. Hey, Gutsy.

40
00:03:40,763 --> 00:03:42,640
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow your roll, sailor.

41
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:45,314
Hey, wait, wait. Isn't that the rehearsal
for the Blue Moon Festival?

42
00:03:45,435 --> 00:03:47,858
What can I say, Clumsy?
You're not on the list.

43
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:49,652
Grouchy, it's right there.

44
00:03:49,814 --> 00:03:53,318
Right. Under "Do not let in Clumsy."

45
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:55,828
Clearly you two
lack the verbal skills required

46
00:03:55,945 --> 00:03:57,993
- to explain this predicament succinctly.
- Hey!

47
00:03:58,114 --> 00:03:59,661
- Here we go.
- You see, Clumsy,

48
00:03:59,782 --> 00:04:03,457
the other Smurfs don't want to dance
with you for fear of what are politely called

49
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:05,459
"fractures."

50
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:09,213
How could anybody think that?

51
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:11,677
That's gonna leave a big blue bruise.

52
00:04:13,671 --> 00:04:18,177
Wonderful! Beautiful! Marvelous.

53
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,012
Watch it, there!

54
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:26,852
Cut! Cut! Cut! It's a dance, not dominoes.

55
00:04:27,685 --> 00:04:31,030
- A worry line!
- All right, don't get your petals in a twist.

56
00:04:31,147 --> 00:04:34,993
As happy and as perfect
as life in Smurf village is,

57
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:40,073
even sunshine and butterflies
must have their dark clouds.

58
00:04:40,198 --> 00:04:44,624
And for all Smurfs,
that dark cloud has one name.

59
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:47,876
Gargamel, the evil wizard.

60
00:04:48,414 --> 00:04:52,169
La la la la la la
Sing a happy song

61
00:04:52,418 --> 00:04:56,514
La la la la la la
This is so wrong

62
00:04:56,756 --> 00:04:58,554
"I'm Papa Smurf.

63
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:01,302
"I'm the head of a small group of blue people

64
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:05,765
"and live in the forest
with 99 sons and one daughter.

65
00:05:06,432 --> 00:05:10,062
"Nothing weird about that, no, no.
Totally normal."

66
00:05:10,186 --> 00:05:13,781
"Oh, and I'm Smurfette.
And I think I'm so pretty.

67
00:05:13,898 --> 00:05:16,651
"And I betrayed Gargamel,
and I don't even care.

68
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:19,533
"And everything is just
sunshine and rainbows."

69
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:26,418
But all of that is about to change.

70
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:37,138
I said, "All of that is about to change."
Azrael, that's your cue!

71
00:05:37,255 --> 00:05:39,349
That's your cue to
pounce on the miserable beasts

72
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:42,427
in some kind of a rage-induced feline frenzy.

73
00:05:42,552 --> 00:05:44,020
Yes, good. Yeah. More rage.

74
00:05:44,095 --> 00:05:46,939
Hey, but don't go crazy.
These are the only puppets I have.

75
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:51,519
I am not obsessed with Smurfs, thank you.

76
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:54,355
I simply can't stop thinking about
the miserable beasts

77
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:56,782
every single minute of every single day.

78
00:05:57,483 --> 00:05:58,985
'Cause I need them!

79
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:03,206
It is only by capturing the little wretches
and extracting their happy blue essence

80
00:06:03,281 --> 00:06:06,911
that my magic will finally become...

81
00:06:08,119 --> 00:06:09,291
Not infallible.

82
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:13,124
Invincible! Yes. Thank you.

83
00:06:13,249 --> 00:06:17,971
I shall become the most powerful wizard
in all of the world.

84
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:30,104
Yeah, but you're milking it. Don't milk it.

85
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:31,399
"O great one?"

86
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:34,649
Yes, lying, deceptive,
horrible little Smurfette?

87
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:39,318
"After all your years of Smurf-less searching,
how ever do you expect to find us?"

88
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,119
I'm very glad you asked, my dear.

89
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:44,788
For, you see, I have a magical map

90
00:06:44,864 --> 00:06:47,492
that shows me exactly where
the smurf root grows!

91
00:06:47,617 --> 00:06:52,339
I shall now use my formidable powers
to magically transport us here!

92
00:06:53,873 --> 00:06:56,342
Come, my little fish-breathed friend!

93
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:58,135
Alakazoop!

94
00:07:01,172 --> 00:07:02,549
Great.

95
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:06,678
Ye gods, Azrael. You're a boy?

96
00:07:08,054 --> 00:07:10,648
We really need that Smurf essence.

97
00:07:10,723 --> 00:07:12,066
Alakazamp!

98
00:07:16,145 --> 00:07:17,738
Now tie it off right there!

99
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:21,405
That blue moon time of year again.

100
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:23,907
Time to smurf some magic.

101
00:07:24,028 --> 00:07:27,658
Summon a vision
and see what our future holds.

102
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,960
I must get the visioning potion just right.

103
00:07:31,035 --> 00:07:34,039
The magic is always strongest
during the blue moon.

104
00:07:35,331 --> 00:07:39,177
So far, so good.
Lots of smiles and smurf berries.

105
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:42,596
Clumsy's sitting still. That's always good.

106
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:46,217
A dragon wand.

107
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:49,596
I got it! I got it!

108
00:07:50,346 --> 00:07:51,723
Clumsy.

109
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:57,612
- Help! Save us!
- Papa!

110
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,776
Papa!

111
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:06,491
Clumsy, what have you done?

112
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:09,574
- Hey, Papa.
- Clumsy?

113
00:08:10,032 --> 00:08:11,249
Are you okay?

114
00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:14,333
Yes. Fine.

115
00:08:14,412 --> 00:08:16,915
Why aren't you rehearsing for
the Blue Moon celebration?

116
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:19,963
You know.
A couple guys got smacked in the face,

117
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:22,337
so I thought I'd make
some smurf root mud packs

118
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:25,640
to take down everyone's swelling.

119
00:08:26,716 --> 00:08:29,640
Papa, you're smurf out of smurf root.
I'll go pick some.

120
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:33,431
No! Those fields are too close
to Gargamel's castle.

121
00:08:33,556 --> 00:08:34,933
I'll get the smurf root.

122
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:38,186
You stay in the village and out of trouble.
Do you understand?

123
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:41,944
Okay. If you say so.

124
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:47,954
A vision's never been wrong.
I can't let this happen to my Smurfs.

125
00:08:50,448 --> 00:08:52,997
"Just stay in the village, Clumsy."

126
00:08:53,117 --> 00:08:57,497
Look at all this smurf root.
They are gonna be so proud of me.

127
00:08:58,414 --> 00:09:00,633
Let's see, just a few more...

128
00:09:04,295 --> 00:09:06,013
- Boo.
- Gargamel!

129
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,643
Help!

130
00:09:11,135 --> 00:09:13,479
Good kitty. Good kitty. Look! Look!

131
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:14,980
A ball of yarn!

132
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:17,099
A nice, juicy bird!

133
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:22,654
So, that's it!

134
00:09:24,607 --> 00:09:25,984
It's invisible.

135
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:29,161
Those sneaky... Wait, wait, wait, wait.

136
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:32,331
We don't know if it's safe.

137
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:39,163
Azrael?

138
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:43,175
Are you dead?

139
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:47,388
So, what did you see in your vision, Papa?

140
00:09:47,505 --> 00:09:51,260
Nothing apocalyptic, really.

141
00:09:51,342 --> 00:09:53,015
Everything's going to be just fine.

142
00:09:53,344 --> 00:09:56,769
Perfect. Another year we don't have to
worry about that mean, old...

143
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:59,691
- Gargamel!
- I know who she meant, Clumsy.

144
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,024
No, no! Gargamel!

145
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:06,232
I Gargamel!, kinda, sorta
accidentally led him to the village.

146
00:10:07,358 --> 00:10:09,235
Gargamel!

147
00:10:10,361 --> 00:10:12,113
Smurf for your lives!

148
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:14,198
Everybody skedaddle!

149
00:10:16,909 --> 00:10:18,661
- Into the forest, Smurfs!
- Come on, Clumsy!

150
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:20,997
Sound the alarm, Crazy.

151
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,048
This is really bad!

152
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:24,508
Smurfs, that way!

153
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:27,545
Hey, cat! Azrael, over here! Come on!

154
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:31,716
There you go, you nasty cat.

155
00:10:32,258 --> 00:10:34,010
- This way!
- This is no joke!

156
00:10:34,093 --> 00:10:35,766
- Look out!
- Papa!

157
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,738
Let go! Cursed nature!

158
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,743
Here comes papa, Papa!

159
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:07,294
Papa, your primitive little defenses,
they're useless against me, sir!

160
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:09,678
I laugh at them.

161
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,603
How's that for primitive, Gargamel?

162
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:23,563
Maybe this will all blow over.

163
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:26,111
I can fix this. I just gotta think.

164
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,362
Yes!

165
00:11:27,605 --> 00:11:29,027
Follow me, everyone!

166
00:11:31,442 --> 00:11:33,285
Save yourselves!

167
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:36,155
Clumsy! You're going the wrong way!

168
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,749
- He's headed for the Forbidden Falls!
- With the blue moon coming?

169
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:41,498
- Quickly, Smurfs! Stop him!
- Unbelievable!

170
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:44,213
The one time we want him to trip
and he's running perfectly!

171
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:46,131
- Clumsy!
- Oh, this is a predicament.

172
00:11:46,207 --> 00:11:49,006
"Agony ahead"!
Anybody reading these signs?

173
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:51,428
- This is a predicament!
- This guy's killing me!

174
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:53,426
Looks like we're down to 99 Smurfs!

175
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,052
This is not good at all.

176
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:01,643
Clumsy!

177
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:04,559
Help!

178
00:12:04,642 --> 00:12:06,064
Well, we tried. Let's go.

179
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:09,113
Hold on, lad!
We'll form a Smurf bridge to get you.

180
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:10,690
Not the Smurf bridge!

181
00:12:11,357 --> 00:12:13,234
- There we go.
- Yeah, pardon me.

182
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:15,991
This is not a Smurf bridge,
it's clearly a chain...

183
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,993
- Smurf it, Brainy!
- Smurf it, Brainy!

184
00:12:18,364 --> 00:12:20,458
- The blue moon!
- Oh, dear.

185
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:23,206
- What's happening, Papa?
- What the blinking flip is that?

186
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:24,544
Oh, no!

187
00:12:24,662 --> 00:12:27,085
- The vision!
- Come on, guys!

188
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:29,258
- Pull him up!
- Hurry!

189
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:34,050
- Don't let go!
- Help!

190
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:35,513
Help!

191
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:37,470
Look out for the hole!

192
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:40,348
No, it's more of a vortex. Of a portal.

193
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,225
Smurf up! It's a hole.

194
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:46,600
Hold on!

195
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:49,148
Oh, no!

196
00:12:49,228 --> 00:12:52,858
Looks like you got
the short end of the stick, eh, Papa?

197
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:56,069
Now you belong to me!

198
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,912
Not this time, Gargamel!

199
00:13:19,717 --> 00:13:20,843
What's wrong with you?

200
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:24,976
That was great! Let's have another go.

201
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:27,854
Are you smurf ed? We almost died in there!

202
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:29,230
We're not even wet.

203
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:32,154
What part of the enchanted forest is this?

204
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:34,152
My calculations indicate...

205
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:36,279
That's slimy.

206
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,574
I don't think we're in Smurf village any more.

207
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:40,996
Oh, my.

208
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:46,832
- Smurfs? You may Want to take a look at this.
- What is it?

209
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:50,965
Why are we listening to him?
He just got us sucked through a giant hole.

210
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:52,424
It's not a hole, it's a vortex.

211
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:55,594
And can't we just go around the rock?

212
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:03,473
Oh, my smurf.

213
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:05,395
Where the smurf are we?

214
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:09,521
Up the smurfing creek without a paddle,
that's where.

215
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,523
Well, at least they're not coming after us.

216
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:14,029
Oh, yeah. Really?

217
00:14:15,147 --> 00:14:16,945
- Oh, dear.
- Azrael!

218
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:18,321
- Run!
- Not again!

219
00:14:18,776 --> 00:14:22,451
Azrael? Are you dead?

220
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:31,706
Must have Smurfs!

221
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,341
- We'll circle back when it's safe!
- Run!

222
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:40,135
- Guys, come on!
- Go!

223
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:42,091
- Coming through!
- I'm getting hungry!

224
00:14:42,174 --> 00:14:44,677
Hey, how are you? Yeah, nice to see you.
Enjoy the party.

225
00:14:45,177 --> 00:14:46,474
Hey, can we get
the photographer over there?

226
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:49,648
There's big arrivals happening.
Thanks. Welcome.

227
00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:53,694
Hey, ladies, looking good.
A couple quick, quick tips.

228
00:14:53,811 --> 00:14:55,734
If you could not stand
directly in front of the display,

229
00:14:55,813 --> 00:14:59,158
but over to the sides,
it'd be a bit more visible. Hey, look, product.

230
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:00,359
Also, don't forget to smile.

231
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:03,655
Remember, you're working for
a cosmetics company. That's it.

232
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,831
- Smile, relax, everyone will have a good time.
- Let's go!

233
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:08,580
- Thanks. Thank you so much.
- Hurry!

234
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:10,161
Hello, Henri.

235
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:11,996
On top of everything
with the campaign, Patrick?

236
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,171
Well, as much as I can be.

237
00:15:13,372 --> 00:15:15,750
We certainly did our homework.
We tested the results.

238
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,380
Patrick!

239
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:22,840
- She's pointing at me.
- That can't be good.

240
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:27,227
Odile, it looks fantastic for
Thursday's launch.

241
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:29,263
It's gonna be quite the gala.

242
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:34,068
There he is.
My new vice president of marketing.

243
00:15:34,393 --> 00:15:36,771
- So, wait, you fired Ralph?
- His campaign was rubbish.

244
00:15:36,854 --> 00:15:40,199
He gave me what I asked for, not what I want.

245
00:15:40,566 --> 00:15:42,443
Can you give me what I want?

246
00:15:42,526 --> 00:15:44,028
Is that what you're asking for?

247
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:47,365
How would I know what I'm asking for
when I don't even know what I want?

248
00:15:47,448 --> 00:15:50,497
Well said, Odile. Well said.
That's why you need me.

249
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:54,251
Exacto! I need you to create
a new campaign for Jouvenel.

250
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:58,092
All digital, of course,
so it can be ready on time for the launch.

251
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:00,878
Odile, that's two days.

252
00:16:01,462 --> 00:16:04,591
Sí mi corazón, and it mustn't be delayed.
Is that going to be a problem?

253
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:07,343
No. No, I mean for a whole new campaign,
it's kind of tight.

254
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:09,303
But... No, two days is perfect.

255
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:11,104
God only needed six days
for the whole world, right?

256
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:14,608
Fail me, and maybe you can
go and work for him.

257
00:16:20,272 --> 00:16:22,650
Where are we, Azrael?

258
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:28,489
What manner of freakish realm is this?

259
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:33,957
Okay, one more box of research.
Hey, would you get a cab for me, please?

260
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:35,795
Yes, yes, of course.

261
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:37,790
This day just keeps getting better and better.

262
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:40,839
So we're just gonna jump in the portal,
get back to our village

263
00:16:40,918 --> 00:16:42,261
and everybody's happy, right?

264
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:44,555
Yeah, guys. Let's stay smurftimistic.

265
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,883
You know what?
I choose to be pessismurfstic.

266
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:48,217
We're all gonna die.

267
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,679
Papa Smurf, how do we get home
with the portal closed?

268
00:16:51,762 --> 00:16:54,390
I'm sure when the blue moon rises tonight,

269
00:16:54,473 --> 00:16:56,271
the portal will open again.

270
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,273
Now, let's take shelter till dark.

271
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:00,108
All right, let's get smurfing.

272
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:02,281
Okay, but I'm not happy.

273
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:04,320
- Azrael!
- Run, Smurfs!

274
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:05,693
- Take that!
- Guys, come on!

275
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:08,279
- Quick, to the tree!
- Let's go!

276
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:13,284
- Smurfette!
- My hair! Get back, cat!

277
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:17,458
Way to go, Smurfette!

278
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:21,295
- Oh, no!
- Take one for the team, Clumsy!

279
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,797
- Help!
- Clumsy, look out!

280
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,303
Smurf!

281
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,508
- Clumsy!
- Oh, no!

282
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:30,634
Hey.

283
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:33,353
- Clumsy!
- What a numptie.

284
00:17:33,637 --> 00:17:36,015
- Quickly, to the mechanical wagon.
- Up the tree, Smurfs.

285
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:37,982
Why don't we just go around the tree?

286
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:40,978
There you are. By all means,

287
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:44,739
relax here in the fresh air and the sunshine
while my missing Smurfs could be anywhere.

288
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:47,527
What? Where?

289
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:49,153
Come on! Try and stay with me, Smurfs.

290
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:51,534
- I'm getting too old for this.
- Slow down!

291
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:53,081
Be careful, Brainy.

292
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,124
Hey. Hey!

293
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,168
Seventh Street, from First and A, please.

294
00:17:57,661 --> 00:17:58,958
- Come on, Smurfs!
- I don't like these heights.

295
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:01,335
- Don't look down.
- Come back here, wretched Smurfs!

296
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:02,758
- Hurry!
- We're way up here!

297
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:05,586
A jump from this height
will Knock the blue out of us!

298
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:07,091
- My hip.
- Papa!

299
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,387
- Gargamel!
- Oh, dear.

300
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:09,848
- Stop that carriage!
- Let's go! Let's go!

301
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:12,017
- Wait, wait. I forgot my phone.
- Come back! Stop there!

302
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:14,561
Stop that carriage!

303
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:16,012
Never mind. Here it is.

304
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:18,190
Knock yourself out, Gargamel!

305
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:20,442
You've had that coming for about 30 years!

306
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:21,769
Smurfs!

307
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:32,696
Oh, wow.

308
00:18:37,868 --> 00:18:40,371
Castles and palaces everywhere!

309
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:43,461
- And green goblins!
- And red trolls.

310
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:46,718
And look at the giant princess!

311
00:18:48,587 --> 00:18:51,636
This village is amazing, Papa.

312
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:54,468
Yes, and likely very dangerous.

313
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:56,895
Until we rescue Clumsy and get back home,

314
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:00,816
I need you all to stay close
and do exactly as I say.

315
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:02,939
- Smurf's honor.
- If you say so.

316
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,152
You can count on us, Papa.

317
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:06,571
They can see us! Camouflage.

318
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,232
Blend in.

319
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:24,835
Well, I guess this is our stop. Let's go.

320
00:19:24,915 --> 00:19:27,464
We get to climb another tree.

321
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:30,011
Watch out, watch out.
Hang on, everybody. Hang on!

322
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:31,680
- Brainy.
- That's it.

323
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:35,801
- Thanks a lot. Have a good night.
- I hope Clumsy can breathe in that box.

324
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:38,558
How are we supposed to
find Clumsy in there?

325
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:40,890
- I could attempt to smurf the probability...
- Brainy!

326
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:43,521
- We'll look through every window.
- I don't do windows.

327
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,568
- Now, let's get smurfing.
- You heard him. Come on.

328
00:19:45,644 --> 00:19:48,113
- Every window?
- Piece of cake.

329
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:50,907
- Grace?
- Hello?

330
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:53,485
Guess what? Guess what, guess what?

331
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:57,410
Okay. They invented a zero-calorie pizza.

332
00:19:57,489 --> 00:20:00,163
- No, but that's a good idea.
- Yes. They found...

333
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,002
Baby kicked.

334
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:06,540
- Hi.
- Hi.

335
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:07,916
Please say hello.

336
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:18,722
- Please.
- Hello, little Sea-Monkey.

337
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:21,855
This is the sound of my voice.

338
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:25,939
Hello, son or daughter. Hello.

339
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:28,695
Hello.

340
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:31,986
That is not the sound of your voice.
That is the voice of a robot.

341
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,613
Our child is gonna be attached to the toaster.

342
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:36,821
Or the new VP of marketing.

343
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:40,954
No. No! Oh, my goodness! Oh, my gosh!

344
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:42,124
- It's...
- It's provisional.

345
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:45,246
If I wow Cruella de Odile,
then I'll keep the job.

346
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:48,502
If not, then my head'll be on a pike
next to the last guy.

347
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:51,009
Well, wow you will! You wowed me.

348
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:52,631
But I have two days.

349
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:54,838
- Yikes.
- I know.

350
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:57,015
What if I don't get them done in time?

351
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,058
Oh, HO, you can't come to the ultrasound.

352
00:21:01,553 --> 00:21:02,975
Unless...

353
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:05,933
Wait, the backup ads we have
did fine in focus groups.

354
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:08,860
I could retool those.
I'd have to work around the clock.

355
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:15,526
Azrael, we've come so far,

356
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:19,785
yet ever am I haunted by
the same familiar riddle.

357
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,910
How to find the Smurfs?

358
00:21:24,618 --> 00:21:26,416
If only I...

359
00:21:26,828 --> 00:21:30,549
I'm sorry, is my thinking
interrupting your vile hacking?

360
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:34,970
If only I had something of theirs.
A drop of spittle. A fingernail.

361
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:40,389
Some hair, even.
Then I could make some Smurf magic.

362
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:45,597
Very nice. Are you done now?

363
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:47,064
I don't want to look at it.

364
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:50,439
What? What?

365
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:57,360
Is that... No. No, it can't be.

366
00:21:57,651 --> 00:21:59,244
It is.

367
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:03,657
The tawny locks of Smurfette.

368
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:12,125
Sweet follicular ambrosia!
Silky strands of joy.

369
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:16,094
Mixed with a fair amount of cat vomit.

370
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:21,596
Yes. Yes, I am a genius!

371
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:26,639
With my skills, even this small trifle
of smurfiness

372
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:30,233
will yield me just enough power
to catch them all!

373
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:37,571
I must find a laboratory with which to tease
the magic from these precious little strands.

374
00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:47,201
Yes. It's a bit small,
but this should do nicely!

375
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,458
It's even got its own cauldron.

376
00:22:53,915 --> 00:22:55,508
What died in here?

377
00:22:56,877 --> 00:22:59,175
Open. Open. Open. Open. Open!

378
00:23:03,717 --> 00:23:08,223
Somebody's been working a dark
and terrible magic in there.

379
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:17,902
What is that?

380
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:37,463
On, baby.

381
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:41,923
Daddy is home.

382
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:45,763
Come on.

383
00:23:45,842 --> 00:23:49,392
Papa, I'm familiar with 613 shades of blue,

384
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:51,348
- and that moon is not one of them.
- Papa?

385
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:56,153
Stay calm, everyone.
If the portal opened once, it can open again.

386
00:23:56,227 --> 00:24:00,107
How are we gonna open a magical portal
when we can't even find Clumsy?

387
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,783
Hey, I think I see something up there.

388
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:31,225
Oh, no.

389
00:24:42,857 --> 00:24:45,110
Clumsy? Is that you?

390
00:24:45,694 --> 00:24:46,786
Hello.

391
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:50,449
Help! Help!

392
00:24:56,287 --> 00:24:57,914
Oh, smurf.

393
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:09,301
Hey.

394
00:25:09,634 --> 00:25:11,557
"Berry Boom."

395
00:25:37,245 --> 00:25:38,462
Patrick!

396
00:25:56,014 --> 00:25:58,016
Elway. Elway.

397
00:25:58,099 --> 00:26:00,693
I'm sure this is the box.
When I get my hands on him...

398
00:26:00,769 --> 00:26:02,066
- Someone's coming!
- Smurfs!

399
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:03,237
What is it?

400
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:07,324
No, no!

401
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:11,079
No, no, no, no. Come on, come on, come on.
Please, please.

402
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:12,781
Elway.

403
00:26:13,281 --> 00:26:16,535
Elway. Did you do that?

404
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:18,836
- Come on, put a little smurf into it.
- Hang on, Clumsy.

405
00:26:18,912 --> 00:26:20,710
- I got this side.
- All together now.

406
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:22,416
- Crikey.
- Oh, dear.

407
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:25,964
- Now what, lads?
- What happened to Clumsy?

408
00:26:26,044 --> 00:26:27,717
- I bet they ate him. Let's go home.
- Hide.

409
00:26:27,796 --> 00:26:30,424
GO! Pull the lid!

410
00:26:36,054 --> 00:26:37,271
Gross.

411
00:26:42,185 --> 00:26:43,402
This is so...

412
00:26:59,869 --> 00:27:02,463
- That's Clumsy!
- Charge, Smurfs! Charge!

413
00:27:02,831 --> 00:27:04,754
- Out of the way, big guy.
- Clumsy, we're coming!

414
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:05,925
Excuse me. Pardon me.

415
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,094
- This is for Clumsy!
- Wait for me!

416
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:10,213
- Oh, God!
- Please don't hurt me!

417
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,803
- Please, I just want to go home!
- Are you...

418
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:17,394
Did you just talk?

419
00:27:17,637 --> 00:27:21,232
I'm not saying till you put down
the giant spiky thing.

420
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:22,775
- Clumsy!
- Clumsy, where are you?

421
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:24,444
- Make yourself known!
- Smurf us a sign!

422
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:26,362
- Come out, Clumsy!
- Smurf out, smurf out, wherever you are.

423
00:27:26,437 --> 00:27:28,280
- Are you there?
- Come to my voice, laddie!

424
00:27:28,356 --> 00:27:29,778
- Where are you?
- Can you hear us?

425
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:32,327
- Get out of here!
- Look out!

426
00:27:32,694 --> 00:27:35,413
- Too much aggression!
- Go back to the sewers!

427
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:36,785
Kiss my smurf!

428
00:27:36,865 --> 00:27:40,165
You all find clumsy! The giant is mine!

429
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:42,454
- Over here!
- Get him!

430
00:27:42,537 --> 00:27:44,881
Have you had enough? Tap out?

431
00:27:45,832 --> 00:27:49,382
Okay, so you're like... You're blue, and...

432
00:27:51,171 --> 00:27:52,844
- Oh, gosh, are you okay?
- Quickly!

433
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:54,174
- This way! This way!
- Follow me, Smurfs!

434
00:27:54,257 --> 00:27:56,259
- Clumsy! Where are you?
- Look out!

435
00:27:56,384 --> 00:27:57,636
Other way! Other way!

436
00:27:57,719 --> 00:27:59,187
- Run, Smurfs!
- Come on!

437
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:00,892
Run!

438
00:28:01,598 --> 00:28:02,975
Elway!

439
00:28:03,057 --> 00:28:05,401
- Smurf for your lives!
- Clumsy, where the smurf are you?

440
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:07,946
- Stinky breath.
- Spread out!

441
00:28:08,229 --> 00:28:10,823
Grace! Run!

442
00:28:10,982 --> 00:28:15,203
Stop bleating like a sheep
and let me hog-tie you, you wriggly numptie.

443
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:17,451
Grace, we're being attacked!

444
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,124
Do not be fooled by their cuteness!

445
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:22,578
It's okay, it's okay.

446
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:26,794
They're friendly.

447
00:28:27,332 --> 00:28:29,209
You're lucky your lassie stepped in.

448
00:28:29,292 --> 00:28:32,387
I was about to make haggis
with your innards.

449
00:28:41,012 --> 00:28:44,061
This is it. This is it, Azrael!

450
00:28:44,224 --> 00:28:48,274
Smurfette's hair goes in here,
flows through the Smurf essence extractor,

451
00:28:48,353 --> 00:28:50,776
and finally, I have my Smurfilator!

452
00:28:51,773 --> 00:28:55,277
It's the pièce de résistance. The crème de la...

453
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:59,155
Would you care for a mint when you're done?

454
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:01,992
Yes, yes, yes!

455
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,918
With this precious elixir,

456
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:10,842
my sorcerous spell shall be powerful
beyond all measurable measurement.

457
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:19,677
This one tiny drop will give me
the power to capture them all.

458
00:29:30,144 --> 00:29:31,487
This is great!

459
00:29:31,688 --> 00:29:35,443
La la la la la la
Smurf the whole day long

460
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:39,783
Next time you're feeling blue
Just let a smile begin

461
00:29:39,862 --> 00:29:44,208
Happy things will come to you
So Smurf yourself a grin

462
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:46,878
It's so obvious
that what you're doing is wrong.

463
00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:48,421
Oh, really? After you.

464
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:49,918
How crazy is this?

465
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:53,218
There are little blue people
singing in our kitchen!

466
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:59,682
So you're sticking with your
"this is actually happening" theory?

467
00:29:59,757 --> 00:30:01,384
Sorry.

468
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:06,390
Okay. It says here Smurfs are
mythical creatures from Belgium,

469
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:08,566
- also known as Schtroumpfs...
- Yeah.

470
00:30:08,975 --> 00:30:10,477
Documented by Peyo.

471
00:30:10,768 --> 00:30:14,898
Also says that they bring good luck.
Like leprechauns to the Irish.

472
00:30:14,981 --> 00:30:17,404
It says they're mythical, Grace.

473
00:30:18,067 --> 00:30:19,489
- I'm so sorry, Master Winslow.
- That was great.

474
00:30:19,569 --> 00:30:21,071
Well, they look pretty real to me.

475
00:30:21,195 --> 00:30:22,572
Come on.

476
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:28,752
- Excuse me.
- Okay, to review.

477
00:30:28,828 --> 00:30:33,334
You guys come from a magic forest
where you live in oversized mushrooms.

478
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:35,506
- Yes.
- You're being chased by an evil wizard.

479
00:30:35,585 --> 00:30:37,007
- Yeah.
- And you're trapped in New York

480
00:30:37,086 --> 00:30:38,713
- until there's a blue moon...
- Very good.

481
00:30:38,796 --> 00:30:41,675
And you like to use the
extremely imprecise term "smurf"

482
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:43,931
- for just about everything.
- Smurfxactly.

483
00:30:46,262 --> 00:30:49,015
And you're all
named after your personalities?

484
00:30:49,182 --> 00:30:52,652
Do you get your names when you're born,
or after you've exhibited certain traits?

485
00:30:52,727 --> 00:30:53,899
- Yeah.
- Yep.

486
00:30:53,978 --> 00:30:55,230
Yeah, whatever.

487
00:30:55,313 --> 00:30:58,487
Master Winslow, there must be
something about the blue moon

488
00:30:58,566 --> 00:31:00,193
on your magic window machine.

489
00:31:00,401 --> 00:31:03,075
Just what is this magic searching device?

490
00:31:03,363 --> 00:31:04,910
Right now, I'm using Google.

491
00:31:06,908 --> 00:31:08,876
- Google.
- Google.

492
00:31:11,329 --> 00:31:16,301
Okay. "Blue moon.
A full moon that occurs twice in one month.

493
00:31:16,376 --> 00:31:18,049
"A figurative construct..."

494
00:31:18,461 --> 00:31:20,054
- Much like yourselves.
- Hey!

495
00:31:20,129 --> 00:31:22,928
"But the moon itself
doesn't appear to be blue."

496
00:31:23,091 --> 00:31:24,343
- What?
- Not blue?

497
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:26,143
- Perfect!
- Now we'll never get home!

498
00:31:26,219 --> 00:31:30,269
No cause for alarm, my little Smurfs.
If we're to open the portal home,

499
00:31:30,348 --> 00:31:32,191
I'll just have to smurf us a potion

500
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:33,643
to invoke the blue moon.

501
00:31:33,726 --> 00:31:35,069
You hear that, honey?

502
00:31:35,144 --> 00:31:37,567
They're only staying till
an actual blue moon rises.

503
00:31:37,855 --> 00:31:41,200
Which could happen if the little blue
Santa man makes a magic potion,

504
00:31:41,275 --> 00:31:43,994
which, at this point,
seems completely plausible.

505
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,743
- Want a bite?
- No, thank you.

506
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:49,543
Of course, the stars will
need to be perfectly aligned.

507
00:31:49,617 --> 00:31:54,088
And when that might be is hard to determine
without the proper instrument.

508
00:31:54,622 --> 00:31:57,000
Master Winslow,
might I borrow your stargazer?

509
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:58,175
My what-whatzer?

510
00:31:59,085 --> 00:32:01,087
He doesn't have a Stargazer. Do you?

511
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:04,014
- This is all my fault.
- We're all gonna die.

512
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:06,843
- We're all gonna die!
- Smurf out of it, scaredy-brains!

513
00:32:06,926 --> 00:32:08,394
- One Panicky Smurf is enough!
- Hey!

514
00:32:08,803 --> 00:32:12,558
Besides, Papa had a vision,
and everything turns out smurf y.

515
00:32:12,807 --> 00:32:14,059
Right, Papa?

516
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:20,399
Yes, yes. It all turns out just fine.

517
00:32:24,652 --> 00:32:28,828
We must find this Smurf thief.
Stop your complaining.

518
00:32:28,906 --> 00:32:30,908
If I were a Smurf, where would I go?

519
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,420
You there, you there. Fancy pants.
Have you seen any little blue men?

520
00:32:34,495 --> 00:32:37,044
- Absolutely. What price are we talking about?
- You're selling them?

521
00:32:37,123 --> 00:32:39,217
- Have you looked in the drawer, sweetie?
- Wait, what drawer?

522
00:32:39,292 --> 00:32:41,795
- In the kitchen, Lilly.
- Who is this Lilly?

523
00:32:41,878 --> 00:32:44,301
Are you kidding?
She's the hottest girl in my department.

524
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,599
Please, please. Please, young woodsman.

525
00:32:46,674 --> 00:32:51,100
What does the temperature of this Lilly
have to do with the finding of Smurfs?

526
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:53,773
- Take your meds, man.
- What?

527
00:32:55,099 --> 00:32:57,773
Is everyone in this realm completely insane?

528
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:02,778
Thank the gods, a local wizard. Excellent.

529
00:33:03,107 --> 00:33:05,030
Pardon me, wise sir?

530
00:33:05,109 --> 00:33:07,362
By any chance, have you seen
any little blue men?

531
00:33:08,988 --> 00:33:10,661
They're everywhere!

532
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:13,834
I knew it. I knew it!
I told you we were close, Azrael.

533
00:33:14,368 --> 00:33:15,494
I know.

534
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:20,550
Now, just take one, everybody.
We have to make sure our smurf berries last.

535
00:33:20,625 --> 00:33:22,969
Great. We're gonna be here how long?

536
00:33:23,044 --> 00:33:25,547
Not long. First, we have to get a Stargazer.

537
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:28,891
Next, find a book of spells
and then smurf a portal

538
00:33:28,966 --> 00:33:32,391
and we're home.
Very simple, my little Smurfs.

539
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:34,097
Bye, Elway.

540
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,478
Someone looks smurfalish!

541
00:33:36,557 --> 00:33:38,730
- Why you wearing a leash?
- It's a tie.

542
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:41,062
- Does it keep your neck warm?
- No.

543
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:44,865
Clearly, it functions as an aid in his craft,
like a blacksmith's apron.

544
00:33:44,941 --> 00:33:47,160
I wear it because it's what
everyone wears at work.

545
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,362
What are you, you pasty giant?

546
00:33:49,445 --> 00:33:53,621
I try to get people to buy things
by analyzing market trend predictions.

547
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:57,454
Predictions! He's a fortune teller.

548
00:33:57,537 --> 00:34:00,086
Look, I would love to explain
but I am super late. I gotta go.

549
00:34:00,164 --> 00:34:02,258
- I really don't have time for this.
- What?

550
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:04,047
You had one outfit on,

551
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:07,130
and now you're wearing something
completely different.

552
00:34:07,213 --> 00:34:08,510
- Yeah. It...
- Now, Smurfette,

553
00:34:08,589 --> 00:34:10,717
she probably got the other one dirty.

554
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,643
- Let's not embarrass her.
- Sorry.

555
00:34:12,718 --> 00:34:15,096
Thanks for letting us stay in your mushroom,
Miss Grace.

556
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:19,104
- It's really nice.
- Well, thank you. I'm glad you like it.

557
00:34:19,183 --> 00:34:23,905
I like our little mushroom, too. But you know,
somebody wants a bigger mushroom.

558
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:26,824
But, then you'd be further apart.

559
00:34:26,983 --> 00:34:30,112
You said it, sister. Okay, I've gotta go.
I've got an appointment.

560
00:34:30,194 --> 00:34:31,867
I've got a baby on the way, so...

561
00:34:31,946 --> 00:34:35,291
Wait, wait. We can't just
leave them here alone, without an adult.

562
00:34:36,367 --> 00:34:38,620
I'm 546 years old.

563
00:34:38,703 --> 00:34:40,250
Of course you are.

564
00:34:40,329 --> 00:34:41,876
- They'll be fine. They'll be fine.
- All right.

565
00:34:41,956 --> 00:34:44,129
- Love you.
- Okay.

566
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,093
- Bye. Bye.
- Bye, Grace! Goodbye.

567
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:48,512
By the way, I wouldn't go anywhere
if I were you.

568
00:34:48,796 --> 00:34:49,922
Why not?

569
00:34:50,923 --> 00:34:54,473
Our world doesn't do well
with visitors from other places.

570
00:34:54,552 --> 00:34:56,270
I mean, look what happened to E.T.

571
00:34:57,263 --> 00:34:59,766
It's a movie. A moving picture.

572
00:35:00,141 --> 00:35:02,269
Book. Just stay, okay?

573
00:35:03,185 --> 00:35:06,530
Great. He's gone
and we still don't have a Stargazer.

574
00:35:06,606 --> 00:35:10,782
Wait a smurf. If he's a fortune teller,
he reads stars all the time.

575
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:14,160
Ergo, it's at his place of business.

576
00:35:14,447 --> 00:35:15,994
Excellent work, Brainy.

577
00:35:16,073 --> 00:35:18,041
What are we waiting for? Let's ride.

578
00:35:18,117 --> 00:35:19,960
- Yeah, come on, guys.
- Hey, stop it.

579
00:35:20,036 --> 00:35:22,789
- Come on, Smurfs!
- Let's go get that Stargazer.

580
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:26,293
- Surprise, surprise.
- Oh, no.

581
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:30,050
Clumsy, I think it might be best

582
00:35:30,129 --> 00:35:32,223
if you stay here. You know?

583
00:35:32,506 --> 00:35:34,804
Smurf an eye on the mushroom.

584
00:35:39,055 --> 00:35:41,604
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

585
00:35:42,141 --> 00:35:44,235
- This way, Smurfs!
- Let's follow Mr. Winslow.

586
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:46,904
Well, I can smurf an eye on the mushroom.

587
00:35:46,979 --> 00:35:48,697
Smurf away!

588
00:35:48,773 --> 00:35:50,946
- Let's smurf this joint.
- Is he down there?

589
00:35:51,025 --> 00:35:52,242
- Taxi!
- Can you see him?

590
00:35:52,318 --> 00:35:54,741
Look, he's getting into
the mechanical wagon.

591
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,322
- Oh, no.
- Clearly that distance is too great...

592
00:35:56,405 --> 00:35:59,079
- Off you go!
- No! Gutsy!

593
00:35:59,158 --> 00:36:01,081
Come on, Smurfs! Smurfabunga!

594
00:36:01,202 --> 00:36:02,954
Goodbye, blue world.

595
00:36:03,037 --> 00:36:04,755
Use your hat, you ninny!

596
00:36:04,997 --> 00:36:07,921
Couldn't we just have taken the stairs?

597
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:10,423
- There we go.
- Not funny, Gutsy.

598
00:36:11,462 --> 00:36:13,510
- It was a little funny.
- Smurfs.

599
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,638
We're stopping. Hold on tight.

600
00:36:16,717 --> 00:36:18,060
Not to me, Grouchy.

601
00:36:18,135 --> 00:36:20,638
Oh, did I do that? Sorry.

602
00:36:20,721 --> 00:36:22,815
- Keep the change.
- Thanks, man.

603
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:25,522
Master Winslow, we really need your help.

604
00:36:25,601 --> 00:36:26,727
- Hey.
- Right here.

605
00:36:26,811 --> 00:36:27,983
What are you doing here?

606
00:36:28,062 --> 00:36:31,862
What part of "we need a Stargazer"
don't you understand, you numptie?

607
00:36:32,066 --> 00:36:35,616
- You can't be out in public.
- Who are you talking to?

608
00:36:35,778 --> 00:36:39,123
If we could just have a quick look around
in your predicting parlor...

609
00:36:39,198 --> 00:36:41,292
- We really wanna go home.
- Come on, man, I gotta go.

610
00:36:41,367 --> 00:36:43,495
- Fine. Just come here, come here.
- Please, please.

611
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:45,212
All of you. Trust me.

612
00:36:45,538 --> 00:36:47,006
Careful. Hey, watch the smurf berries.

613
00:36:47,081 --> 00:36:49,504
I'm not going... Hey!

614
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:51,711
- Be quiet.
- It's dark in here.

615
00:36:51,794 --> 00:36:53,137
All right, who smurfed?

616
00:36:54,213 --> 00:36:56,011
Hey! Get your hand out of my kilt.

617
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:58,934
- That's not my hand.
- Hey, ticklish.

618
00:37:01,637 --> 00:37:03,981
- Morning. Morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Winslow.

619
00:37:04,056 --> 00:37:06,058
- Congratulations on your promotion.
- Thank you.

620
00:37:06,142 --> 00:37:08,236
I hope you guys like desk drawers,
because that's where...

621
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,529
- You're late.
- Odile!

622
00:37:11,313 --> 00:37:12,439
You were in my office.

623
00:37:12,773 --> 00:37:15,526
It's my building,
and we have much work to do.

624
00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:18,783
The launch for Jouvenel is tomorrow night.
Is your concept ready?

625
00:37:18,863 --> 00:37:21,707
Close. I had a crazy morning.

626
00:37:22,116 --> 00:37:23,914
What are you doing?

627
00:37:24,034 --> 00:37:28,289
Nothing. I'm excited.
I'm excited about all the concept ideas.

628
00:37:28,372 --> 00:37:33,173
And hungry. Sorry. Hungry for its success.

629
00:37:33,669 --> 00:37:34,795
Nervous energy.

630
00:37:34,879 --> 00:37:36,927
Nervous energy's what's going on up in here.

631
00:37:37,006 --> 00:37:38,223
- I like it.
- Yep.

632
00:37:38,424 --> 00:37:42,224
- The fear of failure is a fabulous motivator.
- True that.

633
00:37:43,012 --> 00:37:44,559
Hey! Stop it.

634
00:37:44,638 --> 00:37:47,391
- Henri.
- Make it work.

635
00:37:47,683 --> 00:37:49,401
You have no idea.

636
00:37:49,727 --> 00:37:51,821
- What is this?
- Why did I get the armpit?

637
00:37:51,896 --> 00:37:55,446
- Stop pushing me.
- Go easy on the cologne tomorrow.

638
00:37:55,524 --> 00:37:57,401
Are you crazy?

639
00:37:57,485 --> 00:37:59,362
- You're gonna get me fired.
- My hair!

640
00:37:59,445 --> 00:38:02,699
I couldn't even breathe in there.
It smelled like the business end of a sheep.

641
00:38:02,782 --> 00:38:04,125
- I don't see a Stargazer.
- How you doing?

642
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:08,125
I'm sorry, Master Winslow,
but we badly need to borrow your Stargazer.

643
00:38:08,204 --> 00:38:11,925
I don't have a Stargazer, okay?

644
00:38:11,999 --> 00:38:16,550
It's not something people of this century
just have, especially here.

645
00:38:16,629 --> 00:38:20,600
- Not happy.
- Now if you'll excuse me, I have to work.

646
00:38:21,175 --> 00:38:24,179
Well, perhaps we could sing
to help things along.

647
00:38:24,261 --> 00:38:27,561
And then we'll get the stargazer.
Come along, Smurfs.

648
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,985
La la la la la la
Sing a happy song

649
00:38:31,685 --> 00:38:33,608
La la la la la la
Smurf the whole day long

650
00:38:34,605 --> 00:38:35,697
Stop.

651
00:38:35,773 --> 00:38:37,116
La la la la la la

652
00:38:37,233 --> 00:38:38,325
Stop!

653
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,323
Sing a happy song

654
00:38:40,402 --> 00:38:43,497
Come on. None of you find that song
just the tiniest bit annoying?

655
00:38:43,572 --> 00:38:45,040
I find it annoying.

656
00:38:45,658 --> 00:38:47,956
Well, what do you sing at work?

657
00:38:48,035 --> 00:38:50,333
- I don't sing at work.
- What?

658
00:38:50,412 --> 00:38:52,414
- And you have to wear a leash.
- Harsh.

659
00:38:52,498 --> 00:38:54,751
I know. How about if we hum?

660
00:38:57,503 --> 00:38:58,595
Please stop humming.

661
00:39:05,302 --> 00:39:06,804
I need to hone my message here.

662
00:39:06,971 --> 00:39:08,143
I've got a message.

663
00:39:08,222 --> 00:39:12,068
"Always chew with your mouth closed."
Papa taught us that.

664
00:39:12,142 --> 00:39:14,019
That's good. You should use that.

665
00:39:14,103 --> 00:39:16,071
Or, "Dance and be happy."

666
00:39:16,146 --> 00:39:18,114
How about, "Grab life by the grapes"?

667
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:21,285
- "Turn that frown upside down."
- "Always bet on blue."

668
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:24,739
- "Have a smurf y day."
- "I kissed a Smurf and I liked it"?

669
00:39:25,614 --> 00:39:28,242
It's an embarrassment of riches.

670
00:39:28,325 --> 00:39:29,702
They're giving you gold here.

671
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,753
- Thank you.
- Master Winslow,

672
00:39:31,829 --> 00:39:35,333
you'll know it's the right message
if it comes from the heart.

673
00:39:35,416 --> 00:39:36,713
- Right, Smurfs?
- Yeah.

674
00:39:36,792 --> 00:39:38,044
- You said it.
- Absolutely.

675
00:39:38,127 --> 00:39:40,346
- Of course.
- Welcome to my world.

676
00:39:45,134 --> 00:39:48,104
I love emerging dramatically
through the smoke.

677
00:39:49,972 --> 00:39:55,900
It makes... It makes me feel
so deliciously mysterious.

678
00:39:57,104 --> 00:40:00,324
Also, it gives the skin a wonderful glow.

679
00:40:00,524 --> 00:40:01,650
What?

680
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:03,076
Where? Where?

681
00:40:04,653 --> 00:40:06,451
What?

682
00:40:08,824 --> 00:40:12,203
Curses! So close.

683
00:40:12,661 --> 00:40:14,334
What?

684
00:40:16,832 --> 00:40:19,426
Theirs is upside-down.

685
00:40:19,627 --> 00:40:22,881
Idiots. They painted it wrong. Come, Azrael.

686
00:40:23,964 --> 00:40:25,056
- Hi.
- Hello.

687
00:40:25,132 --> 00:40:26,179
What are you doing?

688
00:40:26,258 --> 00:40:28,602
Just greening things up a bit.

689
00:40:28,677 --> 00:40:32,398
That's so sweet. That's very sweet but,

690
00:40:32,473 --> 00:40:35,022
you know, I'm not so sure
this stuffs gonna grow out here.

691
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:38,730
We'll see. Smurfs have a very blue thumb.

692
00:40:39,313 --> 00:40:40,860
So where is everybody else?

693
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,567
They went to get a Stargazer

694
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:44,948
so Papa can smurf a blue moon
to get us home.

695
00:40:45,027 --> 00:40:46,279
And they went without you?

696
00:40:46,362 --> 00:40:49,286
Yeah. I mean, who knows why?

697
00:40:51,951 --> 00:40:53,453
- Hey!
- Sorry!

698
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:55,166
Why don't we come inside?

699
00:40:55,245 --> 00:40:58,089
- Smurfs, where are you?
- Make sure to demonstrate that

700
00:40:58,165 --> 00:41:00,213
this new anti-aging cream can make

701
00:41:00,668 --> 00:41:05,890
any woman look beautiful, young, vibrant.
It's almost magical.

702
00:41:05,965 --> 00:41:08,093
Astonishing, really.

703
00:41:11,553 --> 00:41:13,521
I see no transformation.

704
00:41:13,597 --> 00:41:15,975
- Your potion has no power.
- Excuse me?

705
00:41:16,058 --> 00:41:18,902
Well, she's still an eye-offending dogfish,
if you ask me.

706
00:41:18,978 --> 00:41:22,403
- Sir!
- This is my mother who you're speaking of.

707
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:25,068
I'm so sorry. I didn't realize.

708
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:26,777
How sad for you in 30 years.

709
00:41:27,403 --> 00:41:29,997
Henri, escort this lunatic out.

710
00:41:30,072 --> 00:41:31,324
- "Lunatic"?
- Security!

711
00:41:31,407 --> 00:41:34,035
I am the great and powerful Gargamel!

712
00:41:34,118 --> 00:41:38,089
"Lunatic." Could a lunatic do this?

713
00:41:38,247 --> 00:41:40,796
Alakazootiful!

714
00:41:55,472 --> 00:41:56,849
How did you do that?

715
00:41:57,016 --> 00:41:59,144
Yes, and seriously, me next.

716
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:03,822
So sorry, but lunatics and great wizards
never reveal their secrets.

717
00:42:05,482 --> 00:42:08,656
Come, Azrael! Now, where are my Smurfs?

718
00:42:08,777 --> 00:42:10,404
No, no, no, no, no. Don't go.

719
00:42:11,321 --> 00:42:13,198
- I need to know what you just did.
- Not telling.

720
00:42:13,323 --> 00:42:16,497
Please, señor Can you do that again?

721
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:20,339
You may attempt to persuade me.

722
00:42:22,082 --> 00:42:24,050
What is it that you desire?

723
00:42:24,835 --> 00:42:26,462
Riches?

724
00:42:27,755 --> 00:42:28,802
Fame?

725
00:42:30,132 --> 00:42:31,179
Fortune?

726
00:42:32,509 --> 00:42:33,886
With my help,

727
00:42:34,511 --> 00:42:40,609
the whole world
will know the name that is Garbagesmell.

728
00:42:42,644 --> 00:42:43,691
Gargamel.

729
00:42:44,354 --> 00:42:51,158
Yes. With my help, the whole world
will know the genius that is Gargamel.

730
00:42:53,739 --> 00:42:54,865
L.m

731
00:42:56,658 --> 00:43:01,459
I'm sorry. Did you just say "genius"?

732
00:43:02,623 --> 00:43:06,048
So, even though
I'm what you might call accident-prone,

733
00:43:06,168 --> 00:43:09,297
on the bright side, I did
land us all here in your little mushroom,

734
00:43:09,505 --> 00:43:10,973
and we got to meet you and Patrick.

735
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:14,515
You're so sweet. And I know how you feel.
I'm so clumsy, too.

736
00:43:15,135 --> 00:43:16,603
Well, I used to be.

737
00:43:16,887 --> 00:43:18,139
- Really?
- Yeah.

738
00:43:18,597 --> 00:43:21,350
So how long did it take you to...

739
00:43:23,268 --> 00:43:24,565
Gosh.

740
00:43:24,645 --> 00:43:26,818
Un-fumble your feet?

741
00:43:27,898 --> 00:43:32,654
Well, about as long as it takes to realize
that nobody's just one thing.

742
00:43:33,821 --> 00:43:35,368
You can be anything you wanna be.

743
00:43:37,407 --> 00:43:39,876
- "Hero Smurf."
- Yeah.

744
00:43:41,453 --> 00:43:42,545
Probably not.

745
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:46,884
- Hey, Brainy, help me figure this out.
- Let me show you.

746
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,593
First, you put your...

747
00:43:49,711 --> 00:43:50,963
Works every time.

748
00:43:51,046 --> 00:43:53,515
La la la la la la
Sing a happy song

749
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:57,060
This is a fascinating wind machine
you have here.

750
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:05,227
- Hi, Patrick.
- Grace, help. Help!

751
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:08,063
They are everywhere
and they won't stop singing.

752
00:44:08,188 --> 00:44:11,783
I cannot get a thing done.
Please come and get these guys.

753
00:44:14,987 --> 00:44:16,705
Señor Gargamel, I'll be frank.

754
00:44:16,947 --> 00:44:23,045
Clinique, Lancôme, MAC. They will kill
to get what you have in that ring.

755
00:44:23,245 --> 00:44:24,747
Not if we Kill them first.

756
00:44:25,205 --> 00:44:29,460
Let's see, we're going to need some knights,
preferably in shining armor,

757
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,588
some bowmen, poison arrows.

758
00:44:33,255 --> 00:44:34,632
I like the way you think.

759
00:44:34,715 --> 00:44:36,513
And some spikes to mount their heads on.

760
00:44:36,758 --> 00:44:38,180
Well, it is all about the presentation.

761
00:44:38,385 --> 00:44:42,231
And, of course, all of our testing
would be animal cruelty-free?

762
00:44:42,472 --> 00:44:45,225
What, they pay extra for the animal cruelty?
Is that it?

763
00:44:45,475 --> 00:44:46,647
Get out of here.

764
00:44:50,355 --> 00:44:52,449
You have a wicked sense of humor.

765
00:44:52,524 --> 00:44:54,526
- We like that, don't we?
- Hey, out of here!

766
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:55,827
Henri?

767
00:44:56,445 --> 00:44:57,662
I said, get out of here.

768
00:44:57,821 --> 00:45:02,076
Señor Gargamel,
now you must assure me, darling,

769
00:45:02,326 --> 00:45:06,081
that you can recreate whatever it was
that you did to my mother,

770
00:45:06,413 --> 00:45:08,336
but on a massive scale.

771
00:45:08,832 --> 00:45:12,336
Do that, and the world will worship you.

772
00:45:12,794 --> 00:45:14,922
- Did you hear that, Azrael?
- Yeah.

773
00:45:15,297 --> 00:45:22,397
"Worship." Oh, it rolls off the tongue
like flesh from a... Not pilgrim...

774
00:45:24,097 --> 00:45:25,519
Heretic. Yes, thank you.

775
00:45:26,934 --> 00:45:29,733
Thank the gods, a chamber pot.

776
00:45:30,103 --> 00:45:34,153
This swill that you call Dom Pérignon
has gone straight to my nether regions.

777
00:45:44,743 --> 00:45:48,168
Here, toss this out the window, yeah?
Today, please.

778
00:45:49,581 --> 00:45:51,959
Now, to the matter at hand.

779
00:45:52,793 --> 00:45:54,466
So do we have a deal, señor?

780
00:45:56,088 --> 00:45:58,386
Not quite, my sweet maiden.

781
00:45:58,465 --> 00:46:04,188
You see, first I must have my Smurfs.

782
00:46:07,266 --> 00:46:10,816
You guys just have to understand that
Patrick's under a lot of pressure right now.

783
00:46:10,894 --> 00:46:12,988
So if you could just lay low for a little bit...

784
00:46:13,063 --> 00:46:16,658
You have my word of honor, Miss Grace.
My Smurfs will not move from this bag.

785
00:46:16,733 --> 00:46:18,406
- Okay, good.
- Stargazer!

786
00:46:18,568 --> 00:46:20,787
- What?
- Stargazer! Let's go!

787
00:46:20,862 --> 00:46:22,079
- Everybody out! Come on!
- No, no, no!

788
00:46:22,155 --> 00:46:23,247
- Guys, let's go!
- No, no, no, no, no!

789
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:25,367
- Full Smurf ahead.
- No, wait, wait!

790
00:46:25,701 --> 00:46:26,793
Hit the deck!

791
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:29,913
Hey, I'm walking here! I'm walking!

792
00:46:29,997 --> 00:46:31,749
- Save me!
- Hey, look out, Brainy.

793
00:46:31,832 --> 00:46:33,425
Can't everyone just slow down

794
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,592
- and enjoy life?
- Get off me. Get off!

795
00:46:34,668 --> 00:46:35,715
Wait for it.

796
00:46:36,086 --> 00:46:37,463
I gotta get me one of those.

797
00:46:37,754 --> 00:46:38,846
Oh, my gosh!

798
00:46:38,922 --> 00:46:40,640
- Hey, lady! Hey!
- Wait, wait. Hold on!

799
00:46:40,716 --> 00:46:44,596
When we get inside, spread out
and find that Stargazer.

800
00:46:44,678 --> 00:46:45,850
Come on, Smurfs!

801
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,288
- Hey.
- Patrick, the Smurfs have gone AWOL.

802
00:47:10,412 --> 00:47:11,538
Grace, are you running?

803
00:47:11,621 --> 00:47:13,123
No, no, I'm totally fine,
but they need your help!

804
00:47:13,206 --> 00:47:15,049
Patrick, I'm afraid they're gonna
get themselves killed!

805
00:47:15,125 --> 00:47:17,253
Sweetie, they're fine.
They can send us a tiny thank-you note

806
00:47:17,336 --> 00:47:19,464
when they get back to shroom town.
Right after they invent paper.

807
00:47:19,588 --> 00:47:20,760
Patrick, they need you.

808
00:47:21,006 --> 00:47:22,474
- Honey...
- Patrick, I need you.

809
00:47:22,924 --> 00:47:23,971
Oh, my gosh, please hurry!

810
00:47:24,259 --> 00:47:25,511
All right. Where are you?

811
00:47:26,136 --> 00:47:31,017
The man is a lunatic. It's not going to work.
I don't know, he needs Smoops.

812
00:47:31,099 --> 00:47:32,191
- "Smurfs."
- Smarps.

813
00:47:32,267 --> 00:47:35,146
No, no, "Smurfs." "Smurfs" with an...

814
00:47:35,312 --> 00:47:36,438
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

815
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:37,864
You call that groveling, you fool?

816
00:47:39,107 --> 00:47:41,360
Every village has an idiot. What?

817
00:47:42,486 --> 00:47:46,411
You're right. That's him!
Stop! Stop! Smurf thief!

818
00:47:46,615 --> 00:47:48,117
Smurf thief!

819
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:49,793
Come on, guys, the dolls are here!

820
00:47:49,868 --> 00:47:53,623
Stargazer, Stargazer, Stargazer.
Stargazer, Stargazer, Stargazer, Stargazer...

821
00:47:55,499 --> 00:47:58,503
So that's where all the unicorns went.

822
00:47:58,627 --> 00:48:01,471
I'm not afraid to go off on my own,
I thought you might like the company.

823
00:48:01,546 --> 00:48:03,014
Fine. Then hang on.

824
00:48:05,634 --> 00:48:09,229
A Smurf cannon! The only way to fly.

825
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:11,772
Perfect.

826
00:48:13,725 --> 00:48:17,446
Time to catch some air! Smurfabunga!

827
00:48:18,438 --> 00:48:20,031
That'll put some air up your skirt!

828
00:48:23,235 --> 00:48:25,078
Gotta be a Stargazer up here somewhere.

829
00:48:25,278 --> 00:48:26,495
Predator!

830
00:48:29,533 --> 00:48:30,955
Smurf droppings.

831
00:48:33,161 --> 00:48:36,381
These are disgustingly tasty.

832
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:39,835
Hello.

833
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:42,717
Oh, creepy.

834
00:48:42,796 --> 00:48:45,800
I hope they weren't looking
for a stargazer, too.

835
00:48:45,882 --> 00:48:47,509
Stargazers, stargazers...

836
00:48:47,634 --> 00:48:48,851
Dresses!

837
00:48:48,927 --> 00:48:52,352
You mean I can have
more than one kind of dress?

838
00:48:52,431 --> 00:48:53,478
What?

839
00:48:53,557 --> 00:48:55,605
Papa, I'm telling you,
we're never gonna find those...

840
00:48:55,684 --> 00:48:57,778
- Stargazers.
- They're dangerously high.

841
00:48:57,853 --> 00:49:00,322
You're right.
We're gonna need something tall.

842
00:49:07,487 --> 00:49:10,366
- Don't you think someone will notice us?
- Just act natural.

843
00:49:10,449 --> 00:49:12,042
- I'm a bear.
- Brainy!

844
00:49:13,869 --> 00:49:15,712
I'm coming. I'm coming, I'm coming, guys.

845
00:49:15,871 --> 00:49:17,714
Hold still, stairs!

846
00:49:18,165 --> 00:49:19,667
Look at the stair-climbing toy!

847
00:49:19,749 --> 00:49:20,921
- Hey.
- What is that?

848
00:49:21,042 --> 00:49:22,134
- Let me see it.
- Careful.

849
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:24,178
- I want one, too, Mommy!
- Let me see.

850
00:49:24,754 --> 00:49:26,756
I'm just tired of the whole dating game.

851
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:30,140
Just say who you are
and be who you say, right?

852
00:49:31,011 --> 00:49:32,729
I can't seem to get it to scan.

853
00:49:32,804 --> 00:49:35,057
My son wants one of those
blue animatronic things.

854
00:49:35,849 --> 00:49:37,317
Can you help me out here?
Do they come in pink?

855
00:49:37,392 --> 00:49:38,860
- My daughter wants pink.
- I'm sorry.

856
00:49:38,935 --> 00:49:40,232
What aisle did you find this on?

857
00:49:40,312 --> 00:49:41,404
- I'll take the floor model.
- I was here first.

858
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:44,450
- There's a line.
- Can I interest you in a Coldy Holdy Ice Bat?

859
00:49:44,566 --> 00:49:45,783
What? Ice Bat?

860
00:49:46,151 --> 00:49:47,448
It comes in pink.

861
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:53,538
Smurf thief! Stop!

862
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:05,175
Do I use my grouchiness as a wall
because I'm afraid to be vulnerable?

863
00:50:05,337 --> 00:50:06,634
You bet.

864
00:50:06,755 --> 00:50:08,382
Smurf!

865
00:50:08,465 --> 00:50:09,808
But I've got feelings.

866
00:50:09,883 --> 00:50:13,262
No. No, I can't be out already!
What was I thinking?

867
00:50:13,386 --> 00:50:16,981
Wasting my only drop of Smurf essence
on that old hag?

868
00:50:24,314 --> 00:50:26,487
It's a big problem, sir.
We don't seem to have it in stock.

869
00:50:26,566 --> 00:50:29,945
Hey! Keep your smurfs to yourselves!

870
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:33,619
- Don't you people have any boundaries?
- Grab it!

871
00:50:33,698 --> 00:50:35,245
I'm not a toy!

872
00:50:35,325 --> 00:50:36,497
- Where is she?
- Where'd she go?

873
00:50:36,576 --> 00:50:37,623
- There she is!
- There she is!

874
00:50:37,702 --> 00:50:39,079
Hey, this dress is mine!

875
00:50:39,412 --> 00:50:41,790
- Smurfette!
- Wait, I'm shopping.

876
00:50:41,915 --> 00:50:44,338
- Let's shop later.
- Go! Come on!

877
00:50:45,544 --> 00:50:47,262
- Patrick! Patrick, help!
- Clumsy, come here!

878
00:50:47,546 --> 00:50:50,550
A giant's after me! She's huge!

879
00:50:51,091 --> 00:50:52,638
Hey, that's mine!

880
00:50:52,759 --> 00:50:54,887
Sorry, little girl, this one's not for...

881
00:50:55,095 --> 00:50:56,893
- Mommy!
- Really?

882
00:50:57,389 --> 00:51:03,021
Don't ever forget that one magical moment
our two worlds met.

883
00:51:03,103 --> 00:51:05,197
And I wasn't grouchy, I wasn't.

884
00:51:07,232 --> 00:51:11,578
Can you just say one thing, please?
I'm dying here.

885
00:51:11,653 --> 00:51:12,996
Hey!

886
00:51:13,321 --> 00:51:14,823
That's one!

887
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:18,334
Technically, when loading cargo
onto the head of a bear,

888
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:20,629
- one should distribute the weight...
- Brainy, just pull.

889
00:51:20,704 --> 00:51:23,799
Ahoy, mateys! What are ya waiting for?
We're drawin' a crowd.

890
00:51:24,541 --> 00:51:26,669
- Show-off.
- Oh, dear. They think we're toys.

891
00:51:26,751 --> 00:51:29,880
Hold onto your knickers, boys,
it's about to get grisly.

892
00:51:29,963 --> 00:51:33,342
- Don't let me fall!
- Just hang onto that stargazer, you two!

893
00:51:33,425 --> 00:51:34,677
- Hey! Come on, Smurfs!
- They're getting away!

894
00:51:34,759 --> 00:51:36,056
Let's go, go, go!

895
00:51:36,136 --> 00:51:38,264
I'll have you at ramming speed in no time.

896
00:51:38,346 --> 00:51:40,519
- Hold on!
- I think we lost them.

897
00:51:41,391 --> 00:51:42,859
- Again with the head.
- Oh, dear.

898
00:51:42,934 --> 00:51:45,938
- Out of the way or I'll caber toss ya!
- Where did you learn how to drive?

899
00:51:46,021 --> 00:51:48,490
- You think you can do better?
- Yes, I do believe I can do better.

900
00:51:51,151 --> 00:51:52,903
Two more!

901
00:51:53,403 --> 00:51:55,952
- Brainy! Gutsy!
- Papa!

902
00:51:58,199 --> 00:51:59,542
Grace, that's Gargamel!

903
00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:06,300
- Oh, you again! Get your paws off me!
- No, no, no, no.

904
00:52:07,334 --> 00:52:08,711
Bad kitty!

905
00:52:09,169 --> 00:52:10,466
Oh, I hate that Cat!

906
00:52:17,344 --> 00:52:18,687
Gargamel.

907
00:52:18,887 --> 00:52:20,389
Smurfette.

908
00:52:20,472 --> 00:52:22,850
More lovely than ever.

909
00:52:23,058 --> 00:52:26,403
Oh, Gargamel,
I guess you've outsmarted us again.

910
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,988
Or not!

911
00:52:30,732 --> 00:52:34,737
Azrael. Azrael, what are you doing?
Get out of my suckamajig!

912
00:52:35,654 --> 00:52:37,201
- Get out!
- Let me help you with that.

913
00:52:38,073 --> 00:52:41,919
Oh, thank you, kind... You! You...

914
00:52:46,956 --> 00:52:48,003
Yahoo!

915
00:52:50,543 --> 00:52:51,715
- Patrick.
- Hey.

916
00:52:53,505 --> 00:52:54,927
- Impressive.
- Thanks.

917
00:52:55,006 --> 00:52:56,633
- I'll get the Stargazer.
- I'll get the Smurfs.

918
00:53:03,973 --> 00:53:07,944
That's him! He took it right off my back!
Leaf-blower thief!

919
00:53:08,019 --> 00:53:09,771
Please stand up, sir.
You're going downtown.

920
00:53:09,979 --> 00:53:13,233
- Do not resist. Do not resist!
- Unhand me. Unhand me, you heathens!

921
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:17,454
Or suffer the wrath
of the great and powerful...

922
00:53:23,868 --> 00:53:26,041
Let me... Let me see here...

923
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:51,029
How can you be the only girl in the village?

924
00:53:51,104 --> 00:53:54,734
Well, see, I wasn't brought
by a stork like the others.

925
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:59,530
I was created by Gargamel
to trap the other Smurfs.

926
00:53:59,779 --> 00:54:02,623
Wow. And then what happened?

927
00:54:02,907 --> 00:54:04,204
Papa saved me.

928
00:54:04,284 --> 00:54:09,211
He cast a special spell and then helped me
become the Smurf I was meant to be.

929
00:54:09,914 --> 00:54:11,541
No. Play it safe.

930
00:54:16,004 --> 00:54:22,558
"Odile, pending your approval,
it's ready to go to the billboard agency."

931
00:54:24,929 --> 00:54:28,308
Well, here goes nothing.

932
00:54:30,351 --> 00:54:33,571
- Papa should be done by now.
- Yeah. Enough with the suspense.

933
00:54:33,646 --> 00:54:35,694
- I wanna go home.
- Me, too.

934
00:54:35,815 --> 00:54:39,615
Now that that wily wizard's got our scent,
it's a whole new wager.

935
00:54:39,694 --> 00:54:42,573
Without that blue moon,
our giblets are gravy.

936
00:54:45,492 --> 00:54:46,960
Well, it's off.

937
00:54:47,035 --> 00:54:50,380
Time to either celebrate
or file for unemployment.

938
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:53,541
Hey, what's wrong?

939
00:54:53,833 --> 00:54:55,426
- I'm sure we'll be fine.
- Oh. It's okay.

940
00:54:55,502 --> 00:54:58,051
- That one's hypersmurfilating.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

941
00:54:58,171 --> 00:55:00,094
- It's all this waitin' that's killin' us.
- Yeah.

942
00:55:00,882 --> 00:55:02,805
I know the feeling.

943
00:55:04,344 --> 00:55:06,096
Better yet...

944
00:55:06,346 --> 00:55:08,064
I know the cure.

945
00:55:10,975 --> 00:55:13,353
You just match the colors with the buttons.

946
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:23,408
You try.

947
00:55:23,488 --> 00:55:25,832
Hey! Go, Grouchy!

948
00:55:26,157 --> 00:55:27,830
- You're good!
- Nice one!

949
00:55:28,535 --> 00:55:31,709
Hey, look at me, guys! I'm shredding!

950
00:55:31,788 --> 00:55:32,960
Walk this way...

951
00:55:33,039 --> 00:55:34,165
You sing.

952
00:55:34,249 --> 00:55:37,298
Talk this way
Just give me a kiss

953
00:55:39,337 --> 00:55:40,805
It's a rock face.

954
00:55:41,506 --> 00:55:43,224
- It's Gene Simmons. He's a...
- Huh?

955
00:55:43,299 --> 00:55:44,346
Never mind.

956
00:55:44,425 --> 00:55:45,768
- Like this
- Like this

957
00:55:49,556 --> 00:55:51,809
Smurfette sweetie is a classy kind of sassy

958
00:55:51,891 --> 00:55:53,734
Little skirts climbing way up her knee

959
00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:55,983
Not another single girl
in the whole smurf in' world

960
00:55:56,062 --> 00:55:58,156
And I can't believe
she's lookin' at me

961
00:55:58,231 --> 00:55:59,323
- it's a complete
- Surrender

962
00:55:59,399 --> 00:56:00,616
- To the power of her
- Gender

963
00:56:00,692 --> 00:56:02,569
So I close my eyes and make a wish

964
00:56:02,652 --> 00:56:03,744
- I just want to
- Savor

965
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:04,912
- All her smurf berry
- Flavor

966
00:56:04,988 --> 00:56:07,286
So I smurf ed her just a little kiss
Like this

967
00:56:12,787 --> 00:56:15,290
- Check out Clumsy.
- Whoa, Clumsy.

968
00:56:15,373 --> 00:56:17,250
- You found your niche.
- Yeah!

969
00:56:17,333 --> 00:56:19,677
Clumsy, holdin' it down. Look at him go!

970
00:56:20,378 --> 00:56:21,721
- Come on, Gutsy!
- Here we go!

971
00:56:21,796 --> 00:56:24,675
Yay, Gutsy! Get down with your bad smurf!

972
00:56:24,757 --> 00:56:26,225
- Go, Gutsy!
- That's right.

973
00:56:27,802 --> 00:56:30,225
- Careful.
- Get your smurf on!

974
00:56:30,305 --> 00:56:31,807
- Gutsy!
- Nice!

975
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:33,563
- Yeah!
- Thank you.

976
00:56:33,766 --> 00:56:35,313
That was rare.

977
00:56:55,038 --> 00:56:58,133
Hey, guys. How do you like my new dress?

978
00:56:59,292 --> 00:57:01,420
Whoa! Is there a draught in here?

979
00:57:01,502 --> 00:57:04,847
Oh, okay, that's not what I had in mind.

980
00:57:06,716 --> 00:57:08,263
Are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

981
00:57:08,468 --> 00:57:09,936
Sorry, boys.

982
00:57:11,304 --> 00:57:13,602
Yeah, that cools the giblets.

983
00:57:13,681 --> 00:57:17,231
Nothin' like a cool breeze
through my Enchanted Forest.

984
00:57:23,608 --> 00:57:25,076
- It's approved.
- What?

985
00:57:25,151 --> 00:57:27,153
- She approved it. She approved the ad!
- She loved it?

986
00:57:27,236 --> 00:57:31,082
Well, she said "approved,"
so coming from her, that's love.

987
00:57:31,324 --> 00:57:32,701
Oh, my goodness!

988
00:57:32,784 --> 00:57:34,252
- Patrick, yeah!
- You owned it!

989
00:57:34,452 --> 00:57:36,750
Oh, my goodness! Yay, Patrick!

990
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:38,923
Yeah.

991
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:41,713
No jumping, no jumping, no jumping.
No jumping, no jumping. Okay.

992
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,463
- Should I send it? I'm not going to.
- Yes! Do it!

993
00:57:44,545 --> 00:57:45,717
- Do it this minute.
- I will do it. All right.

994
00:57:45,797 --> 00:57:47,515
Do it, do it.

995
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:48,716
Go, go, go!

996
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:51,428
Tomorrow this'll be on every billboard
in New York City.

997
00:57:51,552 --> 00:57:53,020
It's a go, laddie boy!

998
00:57:53,554 --> 00:57:56,558
- Well done, Master Winslow.
- Oh! Hey, guys, Papa's back.

999
00:57:56,641 --> 00:57:58,314
- Papa, are your calculations done?
- Yeah!

1000
00:57:58,601 --> 00:58:00,103
I'm nearly out of smurf berries.

1001
00:58:00,186 --> 00:58:03,531
It's proving more difficult than I'd hoped.

1002
00:58:03,773 --> 00:58:05,571
But we are going home, right?

1003
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:08,699
Of course. Just not tonight.

1004
00:58:09,904 --> 00:58:11,372
Now, off to bed.

1005
00:58:15,702 --> 00:58:19,206
I was hoping I'd be sleeping
in my mushroom tonight.

1006
00:58:19,414 --> 00:58:21,212
I miss the other Smurfs.

1007
00:58:21,916 --> 00:58:23,338
Me, too.

1008
00:58:23,418 --> 00:58:25,921
I've never spent the night away
from home before.

1009
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:30,516
Well, there was last night.
But who could sleep?

1010
00:58:32,427 --> 00:58:34,600
Hush. Hush now, Smurfs.

1011
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:38,604
Everything's going to be just fine.

1012
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:40,227
Papa?

1013
00:58:40,309 --> 00:58:44,780
Do you really believe we're ever gonna
get home to the other Smurfs?

1014
00:58:45,314 --> 00:58:46,736
Don't worry.

1015
00:58:46,816 --> 00:58:49,695
We'll be reunited with the others
soon enough.

1016
00:58:54,282 --> 00:58:57,456
If only the stars would align.

1017
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:09,840
You know who I miss?
Chef Smurf. Hefty Smurf.

1018
00:59:09,964 --> 00:59:13,059
- Hey, Jokey Smurf.
- G reedy. Narrator.

1019
00:59:13,468 --> 00:59:16,142
- Painter. Baker.
- Harmony.

1020
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:20,691
Oh, I miss Complimentary Smurf.
He always has such nice things to say.

1021
00:59:20,808 --> 00:59:23,937
I'll tell you who I don't miss,
Passive-Aggressive Smurf.

1022
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:25,192
- Aye.
- Yeah.

1023
00:59:25,313 --> 00:59:28,817
He's always so nice,
but when he leaves you feel bad.

1024
00:59:29,859 --> 00:59:33,204
Ah, another wretched Smurf less night.

1025
00:59:33,863 --> 00:59:36,491
Oh, hello, little moth.

1026
00:59:36,574 --> 00:59:42,422
Perhaps with your help
I'll find a way to get them back.

1027
00:59:43,164 --> 00:59:46,714
Oh, you and I are kindred spirits, little one.

1028
00:59:47,251 --> 00:59:49,299
Both of us meant to soar.

1029
00:59:49,378 --> 00:59:54,384
Go now, and bring back an army
of mighty eagles to free me.

1030
00:59:54,926 --> 00:59:58,521
Fly, tiny eagle.
Fly and bring back your brethren.

1031
00:59:58,679 --> 01:00:00,852
Fly! Fly!

1032
01:00:01,182 --> 01:00:02,559
Fly!

1033
01:00:07,188 --> 01:00:10,362
Okay. Let's see here.

1034
01:00:10,441 --> 01:00:11,567
Hey.

1035
01:00:12,193 --> 01:00:13,945
I'm guessing you have
a long night ahead of you.

1036
01:00:15,196 --> 01:00:18,450
- You guys drink coffee?
- Is a Smurf's butt blue?

1037
01:00:20,576 --> 01:00:26,299
So tell me, that weird guy
in the ratty bathrobe at the toy store?

1038
01:00:26,374 --> 01:00:29,127
- Gargamel?
- He's not really a wizard, is he?

1039
01:00:29,252 --> 01:00:33,302
Not the smartest of sorcerers,
but dangerous just the same.

1040
01:00:34,048 --> 01:00:35,220
Thank you.

1041
01:00:36,425 --> 01:00:40,100
Back home, I could hold him at bay
with a spell or two.

1042
01:00:40,304 --> 01:00:42,898
But here, without my books and potions...

1043
01:00:42,974 --> 01:00:47,730
Well, today we got lucky.
But next time, who knows?

1044
01:00:48,062 --> 01:00:49,234
Well, what are you gonna do?

1045
01:00:49,438 --> 01:00:53,568
I'll do anything and everything I can do
to get my Smurfs home.

1046
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:57,618
I won't ever give up. They're my family.

1047
01:00:58,114 --> 01:01:00,583
And you never give up on family.

1048
01:01:04,245 --> 01:01:07,249
Doesn't it freak you out sometimes

1049
01:01:07,999 --> 01:01:11,173
having all those little guys
depending on you?

1050
01:01:12,587 --> 01:01:14,931
I mean, what if you screw up?

1051
01:01:15,923 --> 01:01:17,846
How'd you know when you were ready?

1052
01:01:18,259 --> 01:01:20,512
Here. Come sit on Papa's lap.

1053
01:01:22,763 --> 01:01:24,891
Yeah, right. Scratch that.

1054
01:01:24,974 --> 01:01:27,648
- Probably not the best idea.
- Yeah, yeah.

1055
01:01:27,768 --> 01:01:29,190
Let me ask you something.

1056
01:01:29,812 --> 01:01:32,941
Why did you come for us today
when your Grace called?

1057
01:01:33,441 --> 01:01:36,445
She needed me. I could hear it in her voice.

1058
01:01:38,613 --> 01:01:40,911
Well, that's what being a papa is.

1059
01:01:40,990 --> 01:01:43,459
When it comes time, you just do.

1060
01:01:44,952 --> 01:01:48,206
And knowing what to do
doesn't come from up here.

1061
01:01:51,709 --> 01:01:55,339
It comes from here, where it matters most.

1062
01:01:56,547 --> 01:01:58,140
My spleen?

1063
01:01:58,216 --> 01:02:00,514
No, your heart.

1064
01:02:00,635 --> 01:02:04,981
I'm trying to have a moment here,
you whippersnapper.

1065
01:02:09,018 --> 01:02:12,818
- You're a good papa, Papa.
- And you'll be a good one, too.

1066
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:32,963
Come on, what you doing, man?
Get that weight off there.

1067
01:02:33,042 --> 01:02:35,340
Come on, baby, stop playing.

1068
01:02:36,712 --> 01:02:39,841
Come on, you silly moth.
Where are my eagles?

1069
01:02:40,841 --> 01:02:43,014
You know what happens to people
who sit on my bench?

1070
01:02:43,678 --> 01:02:45,021
Be gone with you, behemoth,

1071
01:02:45,554 --> 01:02:49,900
for I have instructed a moth
to summon forth a gaggle of noble eagles

1072
01:02:50,017 --> 01:02:51,735
to free me from this confine.

1073
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:54,022
- Get up, Grandpa!
- Hey.

1074
01:02:55,064 --> 01:02:56,987
You see? You see?

1075
01:02:57,066 --> 01:03:00,536
The dungeon isn't built that can hold
the likes of Gargamel.

1076
01:03:00,695 --> 01:03:06,043
Behold my glorious army of... Flies?

1077
01:03:06,117 --> 01:03:08,791
- Flies? I Said "to fly." "Fly."
- What is this?

1078
01:03:08,869 --> 01:03:12,544
Not "flies," you light-loving moron.

1079
01:03:13,541 --> 01:03:15,714
All right, up, up, up, bother it all.

1080
01:03:15,876 --> 01:03:19,301
Up! Up, you inglorious devils!

1081
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:21,599
So long, scallywags!

1082
01:03:24,302 --> 01:03:27,852
Well, don't do it again.
Go around it, go around!

1083
01:03:27,930 --> 01:03:31,275
- Oh, that's nasty.
- Go around it. Stupid flies.

1084
01:03:31,475 --> 01:03:32,727
Wait, take me with you!

1085
01:03:32,810 --> 01:03:34,904
Wait! Wait!

1086
01:03:38,816 --> 01:03:41,410
To my castle for more essence!

1087
01:03:52,496 --> 01:03:53,998
Here they come, here they come.

1088
01:03:57,460 --> 01:04:00,259
- Pretty smurf y, if I do say so myself.
- Yeah.

1089
01:04:00,338 --> 01:04:03,342
Come on, Elway, right over here.
Good boy. Thank you very much.

1090
01:04:03,424 --> 01:04:05,301
- Oh, my goodness.
- Here we go.

1091
01:04:06,093 --> 01:04:08,437
- There we are.
- Clumsy.

1092
01:04:08,512 --> 01:04:12,016
- Blue thumbs.
- This is unbelievable.

1093
01:04:12,099 --> 01:04:13,521
I think there's too much pink.

1094
01:04:13,601 --> 01:04:17,026
Just because your name is Grouchy
doesn't mean you always have to be grouchy.

1095
01:04:17,104 --> 01:04:18,447
Yeah, it does.

1096
01:04:18,522 --> 01:04:19,899
- Smurfette.
- Hi.

1097
01:04:19,982 --> 01:04:23,407
- High five. High four.
- High four.

1098
01:04:23,486 --> 01:04:29,038
Great news! The stars have revealed
a perfect time to smurf the blue moon.

1099
01:04:30,659 --> 01:04:32,912
- We're going home! Yay!
- I knew you'd do it, Papa!

1100
01:04:32,995 --> 01:04:34,747
- All right!
- Smurftastic!

1101
01:04:34,830 --> 01:04:36,423
I never doubted it for a second.

1102
01:04:36,499 --> 01:04:40,549
It has to be done tonight,
between first star and high moon.

1103
01:04:40,711 --> 01:04:42,588
That's our only chance.

1104
01:04:42,671 --> 01:04:45,675
But we'll need a magic spell
that works in this realm

1105
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:47,768
to open the portal home.

1106
01:04:47,843 --> 01:04:51,017
- Master Winslow, a question, please.
- Yeah, shoot.

1107
01:04:51,138 --> 01:04:53,391
Is there a place that sells spells?

1108
01:04:53,474 --> 01:04:54,726
No.

1109
01:04:54,850 --> 01:04:58,320
- Is there a place that proffers potions?
- Yeah, no.

1110
01:04:58,687 --> 01:05:00,655
How about old books?

1111
01:05:00,981 --> 01:05:03,450
Wait, there's an antique book shop
right near where I work.

1112
01:05:03,526 --> 01:05:05,403
- Yes. Dr. Wong's. Yeah.
- Dr. Wong's something.

1113
01:05:05,486 --> 01:05:09,161
- Perfect. That'll do.
- Oh, hear that, boys? We're almost home.

1114
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:11,163
- Yeah!
- I love being almost home.

1115
01:05:11,242 --> 01:05:13,244
Hey! Smurf hug!

1116
01:05:14,829 --> 01:05:16,672
Oh, I love you guys!

1117
01:05:16,831 --> 01:05:18,299
Bring it in, big fella.

1118
01:05:18,374 --> 01:05:19,967
- I wouldn't...
- Come on, we know you want to.

1119
01:05:20,042 --> 01:05:21,214
- Yes.
- Yeah, come on, Patrick.

1120
01:05:21,335 --> 01:05:22,712
- If I can do it, you can do it.
- Go on, big fella.

1121
01:05:22,837 --> 01:05:24,305
- Here he comes!
- Smurf hug!

1122
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:26,508
- We're goin' home!
- Hey there.

1123
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:34,932
Hey, get up here.

1124
01:05:40,229 --> 01:05:42,823
- That's it, laddie. Nice one.
- What's that?

1125
01:05:42,898 --> 01:05:45,071
Yeah. All of ya. All of ya!

1126
01:05:45,401 --> 01:05:48,245
Oh, look!
We don't have to make a blue moon.

1127
01:05:48,362 --> 01:05:50,035
We've already got one.

1128
01:05:50,281 --> 01:05:51,658
- Really?
- What?

1129
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:54,744
- Look, guys, right over there.
- No, it isn't.

1130
01:05:54,869 --> 01:05:57,463
It is. Smurfette's right.
Look at the blue moon.

1131
01:05:59,915 --> 01:06:02,213
That's the wrong ad.

1132
01:06:12,761 --> 01:06:13,933
What happened to my office?

1133
01:06:14,138 --> 01:06:17,267
We fixed it for the baby. Another smurf hug!

1134
01:06:17,391 --> 01:06:21,066
No. No, no, no. This isn't happening.
This isn't happening.

1135
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:24,982
Someone sent this
to the ad agency last night.

1136
01:06:25,065 --> 01:06:26,692
- Who messed with my computer?
- I dunno.

1137
01:06:26,775 --> 01:06:29,574
- None of my Smurfs would...
- Wasn't me.

1138
01:06:32,948 --> 01:06:37,829
I Gargamel!, sorta, tripped.

1139
01:06:37,912 --> 01:06:40,415
Yeah, well, you Gargamel!, sorta,
just got me fired.

1140
01:06:40,748 --> 01:06:42,500
You sent the wrong file.

1141
01:06:42,583 --> 01:06:45,132
- Patrick, it was just an accident.
- What am I supposed to do, Grace?

1142
01:06:45,252 --> 01:06:47,755
You said that they would bring good luck.
This is anything but good.

1143
01:06:47,838 --> 01:06:50,307
I never should've let this happen.
I should've said no.

1144
01:06:50,424 --> 01:06:54,349
I never wanted a house
full of little people running around!

1145
01:06:58,140 --> 01:06:59,938
Blue. Little blue...

1146
01:07:00,142 --> 01:07:01,314
Okay...

1147
01:07:02,478 --> 01:07:03,604
Patrick.

1148
01:07:05,814 --> 01:07:06,986
What are you doing?

1149
01:07:07,107 --> 01:07:08,825
Going to try to save my job.

1150
01:07:08,943 --> 01:07:11,787
We never intended to be a burden,
Master Winslow.

1151
01:07:11,862 --> 01:07:13,739
I'm smurfilly sorry about what I...

1152
01:07:13,822 --> 01:07:17,872
Stop saying "smurf" for everything.
What does that even mean? Smurf!

1153
01:07:18,285 --> 01:07:19,628
Smurfitty-smurf-smurf-smurf!

1154
01:07:19,703 --> 01:07:23,128
There's no call
for that kind of language, laddie.

1155
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:24,291
See?

1156
01:07:24,833 --> 01:07:26,210
Okay, Patrick, wait.

1157
01:07:27,545 --> 01:07:29,297
- Hey, hey!
- Will you...

1158
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:31,132
- Wait, Patrick.
- Maybe I can try to fix it.

1159
01:07:31,215 --> 01:07:32,558
Just stop and listen to me
for a second, please.

1160
01:07:32,633 --> 01:07:35,557
- What?
- Look, I'm really sorry about your job, okay?

1161
01:07:35,636 --> 01:07:37,684
And I hope that you can straighten that out.

1162
01:07:37,805 --> 01:07:40,183
But you are so not seeing
the big picture here.

1163
01:07:40,975 --> 01:07:44,479
I mean, look around.
Look what's happening right now.

1164
01:07:44,687 --> 01:07:45,859
Of all the people on the planet,

1165
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:48,358
those magical little creatures came to us.

1166
01:07:48,482 --> 01:07:50,155
They chose us.

1167
01:07:50,859 --> 01:07:54,409
Don't you see
how absolutely amazing that is?

1168
01:07:54,697 --> 01:07:56,950
This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing, Patrick.

1169
01:07:57,032 --> 01:07:59,034
This is our blue moon.

1170
01:08:00,578 --> 01:08:03,832
And if you don't stop
for just a second to see that,

1171
01:08:04,081 --> 01:08:05,503
you're gonna miss it.

1172
01:08:13,841 --> 01:08:15,514
Hey, hey. Taxi!

1173
01:08:16,427 --> 01:08:19,431
Come on! Come on! Blast. Blast you!

1174
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:22,854
There's got to be some essence
in here somewhere!

1175
01:08:23,517 --> 01:08:24,860
NOT DOW.

1176
01:08:25,102 --> 01:08:26,570
What? What?

1177
01:08:31,734 --> 01:08:35,409
Very, very well done, my little friend.

1178
01:08:36,572 --> 01:08:39,542
And to think, I almost ate you that time.

1179
01:08:41,035 --> 01:08:45,632
Come, Azrael. We must find this Patrick,
the rouge merchant.

1180
01:08:45,873 --> 01:08:49,218
He will lead us to our
elusive little blue quarry.

1181
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:53,260
Don't you just have a switch or something
to shut them off?

1182
01:08:53,380 --> 01:08:55,178
Tomorrow? Are you kidding me?

1183
01:08:55,257 --> 01:08:58,887
Ron, Ron. If I don't get those ads down now,
I don't have a job tomorrow.

1184
01:09:31,919 --> 01:09:33,466
Smurf me.

1185
01:10:21,885 --> 01:10:23,558
Which way to the bookstore, Brainy?

1186
01:10:23,637 --> 01:10:24,729
According to the searching device,

1187
01:10:24,805 --> 01:10:27,024
we take the F machine
two dots past the red circle to Chinaland.

1188
01:10:27,141 --> 01:10:29,394
- Look out, Brainy.
- "Chinatown," birdbrain.

1189
01:10:29,476 --> 01:10:30,693
- Smurftito, smurftato.
- Here it is.

1190
01:10:30,811 --> 01:10:31,858
- Come on, everybody.
- Let's go, let's go.

1191
01:10:31,979 --> 01:10:33,731
- Mind the gap.
- Wait? Are we sure about this?

1192
01:10:33,814 --> 01:10:35,066
- What?
- Jump!

1193
01:10:35,149 --> 01:10:36,992
- Oh, my.
- Not happy.

1194
01:10:38,902 --> 01:10:41,371
Come on, Brainy_
Let's poke around this great steel carriage.

1195
01:10:41,488 --> 01:10:43,707
- Is it safe?
- Of course it is.

1196
01:10:47,077 --> 01:10:48,670
That was great.

1197
01:10:49,705 --> 01:10:52,424
I hope we find this place soon.
I can't see out of this...

1198
01:10:54,376 --> 01:10:55,593
For smurf's sake.

1199
01:10:55,669 --> 01:10:57,888
I thought that's why we left Clumsy behind.

1200
01:10:58,005 --> 01:10:59,257
Oh, it smells like butter in here.

1201
01:10:59,339 --> 01:11:01,262
Where do you suppose
this magic bookstore could be?

1202
01:11:01,341 --> 01:11:03,014
- Wait a minute.
- There it is.

1203
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:04,512
- It's closed.
- Figures.

1204
01:11:04,762 --> 01:11:07,060
We have to find a way in. Come on.

1205
01:11:13,687 --> 01:11:15,439
I'm gettin' too old for this.

1206
01:11:16,523 --> 01:11:17,775
- Brainy.
- Gutsy.

1207
01:11:17,858 --> 01:11:19,075
All right, everybody.

1208
01:11:19,193 --> 01:11:20,285
- Hey.
- Wow.

1209
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:21,452
This place looks creepy to me.

1210
01:11:21,528 --> 01:11:23,371
It's not creepy, it's different. And I like it.

1211
01:11:23,447 --> 01:11:25,745
Let's just get the book
and get outta here.

1212
01:11:25,866 --> 01:11:29,291
You're right. This book of spells
is our ticket home.

1213
01:11:31,205 --> 01:11:36,462
I am but a simple wizard with a simple desire,
limitless power and world adulation.

1214
01:11:36,627 --> 01:11:39,722
Now why does it have to be so hard?

1215
01:11:45,469 --> 01:11:49,064
Pardon me. Please, wise sir.
Wise sir. Please, please.

1216
01:11:49,223 --> 01:11:51,726
Wherever did you hear
that ear-damning squall?

1217
01:11:51,892 --> 01:11:53,018
It's your little blue men.

1218
01:11:53,101 --> 01:11:55,399
I saw them going into the bookstore
around the corner.

1219
01:11:57,940 --> 01:12:00,284
You know, that song is really annoying.

1220
01:12:01,109 --> 01:12:03,578
Cautiously excited.

1221
01:12:05,155 --> 01:12:08,079
That's not it. That's not it.
Hey! Oh, no, that's not it.

1222
01:12:08,158 --> 01:12:10,832
Look at all these amazing books.
It's gotta be in here somewhere.

1223
01:12:10,953 --> 01:12:13,422
No, this isn't it.
You see anything, Smurfette?

1224
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:16,959
Nothin' up here, guys. Look out below!

1225
01:12:17,417 --> 01:12:20,762
- I've got somethin', lads.
- Great job, Gutsy.

1226
01:12:20,838 --> 01:12:22,761
Oh. Nearly there.

1227
01:12:23,924 --> 01:12:28,600
- Well done.
- Just a minute. That's it. There we go.

1228
01:12:28,762 --> 01:12:30,014
Ah, yes.

1229
01:12:30,097 --> 01:12:32,441
"L'Histoire des Schtroumpfs. 

1230
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:34,772
Peyo.

1231
01:12:37,271 --> 01:12:39,444
- That's us.
- Yes, this is the one.

1232
01:12:41,108 --> 01:12:43,281
- Look at that.
- Wow.

1233
01:12:43,443 --> 01:12:45,116
Well, I'll be smurf ed.

1234
01:12:45,612 --> 01:12:48,206
The secret runes are hidden in the drawing.

1235
01:12:48,282 --> 01:12:49,875
You see all that in there?

1236
01:12:49,992 --> 01:12:52,666
Look here, at the patterns on this page.

1237
01:12:58,542 --> 01:13:00,544
Openous-lockicuss.

1238
01:13:07,634 --> 01:13:09,011
What?

1239
01:13:14,683 --> 01:13:19,359
You're right, Azrael.
This does have "me" written all over it.

1240
01:13:27,154 --> 01:13:30,158
Oh, that's just plain naughty.

1241
01:13:30,490 --> 01:13:35,667
All that remains now is to return
to the waterfall and invoke this spell, tonight.

1242
01:13:35,746 --> 01:13:38,374
- And we can go home?
- And we can go home.

1243
01:13:38,498 --> 01:13:40,592
- Oh, you're going home, all right.
- No.

1244
01:13:40,709 --> 01:13:44,680
To a little place I like to call
BellVeedaRay Castle,

1245
01:13:45,005 --> 01:13:48,760
where your essence shall finally be mine.

1246
01:13:49,384 --> 01:13:51,182
- The dragon wand.
- No!

1247
01:13:51,261 --> 01:13:52,387
It's...

1248
01:13:52,512 --> 01:13:54,264
Oh, please, please, allow me.

1249
01:13:55,766 --> 01:13:58,110
- It's Gargamel!
- Run, Smurfs!

1250
01:13:58,685 --> 01:14:00,062
- Come on, Smurfs!
- Go, go, go!

1251
01:14:00,187 --> 01:14:01,279
Wait for me!

1252
01:14:01,355 --> 01:14:03,449
- To the door!
- Smurfentine! Smurfentine!

1253
01:14:03,523 --> 01:14:05,491
- Hurry!
- Yes, yes, do resist, little Smurfs.

1254
01:14:05,567 --> 01:14:06,739
After all,

1255
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:09,704
what is the hunt without the thrill!

1256
01:14:13,909 --> 01:14:15,081
No!

1257
01:14:23,877 --> 01:14:25,220
- We gotta go! Move!
- Run!

1258
01:14:25,295 --> 01:14:26,922
- Get goin', Smurfs!
- Faster, faster.

1259
01:14:27,047 --> 01:14:28,094
Let's get outta here.

1260
01:14:28,215 --> 01:14:31,936
Brainy, take the spell, brew the potion
and smurf the moon tonight.

1261
01:14:32,344 --> 01:14:33,516
It has to be tonight.

1262
01:14:33,595 --> 01:14:35,142
Me? Smurf the moon?

1263
01:14:35,222 --> 01:14:37,395
- No, no, I'm not ready.
- You have to be.

1264
01:14:38,684 --> 01:14:41,153
- Go. And no matter what happens...
- Papa?

1265
01:14:41,228 --> 01:14:42,821
- ...Do not come back for me.
- What?

1266
01:14:42,896 --> 01:14:44,193
- Papa, no!
- No!

1267
01:14:44,272 --> 01:14:46,570
- Papa!
- What are you waiting for, Gargamel?

1268
01:14:46,692 --> 01:14:49,070
Come to papa, Papa!

1269
01:14:50,278 --> 01:14:52,576
- Just go!
- Papa!

1270
01:14:52,698 --> 01:14:54,041
- Papa!
- No!

1271
01:14:54,116 --> 01:14:55,584
Keep movin', lass.

1272
01:14:55,742 --> 01:14:58,461
- Do as Papa said.
- Papa!

1273
01:14:59,037 --> 01:15:02,211
Is that all that you've got, Gargamel?

1274
01:15:14,386 --> 01:15:16,059
What's gonna happen to Papa?

1275
01:15:16,138 --> 01:15:20,143
Papa told us to smurf the moon,
and that's exactly what we're gonna do.

1276
01:15:20,559 --> 01:15:22,232
Come on. We don't have much time.

1277
01:15:22,436 --> 01:15:23,733
"Come on"? Come on, where?

1278
01:15:23,812 --> 01:15:26,110
How are we gonna get back to Clumsy?

1279
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,778
We ride. Come on!

1280
01:15:31,820 --> 01:15:34,448
- Be still, bird.
- I don't think they're friendly.

1281
01:15:34,573 --> 01:15:36,621
- Well, neither am I.
- But they carry disease.

1282
01:15:37,409 --> 01:15:39,832
And Smurfs. Let's ride.

1283
01:15:39,953 --> 01:15:41,626
- Whoa, bird, whoa!
- Come on!

1284
01:15:41,747 --> 01:15:43,749
But I'm not sure I can do this.

1285
01:15:44,958 --> 01:15:47,336
You can do it, Brainy. Hold on!

1286
01:15:47,961 --> 01:15:51,261
According to my calculations,
this is dangerous!

1287
01:15:53,633 --> 01:15:55,260
It's getting dark.

1288
01:15:55,343 --> 01:15:58,267
Yeah. Yeah, I think
we'd better go look for them.

1289
01:15:58,346 --> 01:15:59,643
Yeah.

1290
01:16:03,185 --> 01:16:04,653
Hi.

1291
01:16:08,857 --> 01:16:12,828
- Where are the others?
- We think they're still at the bookstore.

1292
01:16:13,487 --> 01:16:16,161
Listen, Grace, I'm...

1293
01:16:21,495 --> 01:16:22,667
Hey, Odile.

1294
01:16:22,829 --> 01:16:25,173
Patrick...

1295
01:16:27,167 --> 01:16:29,465
Listen, listen. Before you fire me,

1296
01:16:29,544 --> 01:16:33,014
I know that the ads that ran
weren't the ads I sent.

1297
01:16:34,341 --> 01:16:37,561
But they're the ads I should have sent.

1298
01:16:38,386 --> 01:16:40,559
The ads I almost did send.

1299
01:16:40,972 --> 01:16:43,350
But I didn't 'cause...

1300
01:16:44,893 --> 01:16:46,315
I second-guessed myself.

1301
01:16:47,062 --> 01:16:52,489
I gave you what I thought you wanted,
instead of what I thought was right.

1302
01:16:54,736 --> 01:16:57,159
But this is right.

1303
01:16:57,531 --> 01:17:00,284
It means something to me and...
I don't know,

1304
01:17:00,367 --> 01:17:02,586
I think it's gonna mean
something to others, too.

1305
01:17:04,371 --> 01:17:09,593
It's not just a moon, Odile, it's a blue moon.

1306
01:17:10,418 --> 01:17:12,591
"Once in a blue moon."

1307
01:17:13,588 --> 01:17:18,219
That means that there are
only a few moments in your life

1308
01:17:18,385 --> 01:17:25,234
when something truly memorable,
truly magical, happens to you.

1309
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:32,283
And, if you hesitate, if you're afraid,

1310
01:17:33,733 --> 01:17:35,360
you might just miss it.

1311
01:17:36,778 --> 01:17:39,076
That's what that image means.

1312
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:44,245
Don't let those blue moon moments
pass you by.

1313
01:17:47,455 --> 01:17:50,755
I will call you back to tell you if you're fired.

1314
01:17:56,590 --> 01:17:58,763
I so smurf in' love you.

1315
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:04,348
Left-left, right! Right-right, bird!

1316
01:18:04,431 --> 01:18:06,934
- Brace for impact!
- The window's open, ya ninny.

1317
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:10,233
We're outta control!

1318
01:18:10,604 --> 01:18:12,948
Whoa, bird! Watch out for the...

1319
01:18:13,899 --> 01:18:15,742
- That'll do, pigeon.
- Thank you, bird.

1320
01:18:15,817 --> 01:18:17,660
Look! We got the incantation.

1321
01:18:17,777 --> 01:18:19,825
- Where's Papa?
- Gargamel's got him.

1322
01:18:19,946 --> 01:18:21,994
- What?
- Oh, no.

1323
01:18:22,157 --> 01:18:25,661
He took him to some place
called BellVeedaRay Castle.

1324
01:18:25,785 --> 01:18:28,629
- He's gonna...
- Don't say it.

1325
01:18:28,997 --> 01:18:30,965
BellVeedaRay. What is BellVeedaRay?

1326
01:18:31,082 --> 01:18:34,052
Belve... He's taken him
to Belvedere Castle in Central Park.

1327
01:18:34,127 --> 01:18:36,004
To extract his essence.

1328
01:18:36,129 --> 01:18:38,052
- What? Well, we have to go get him.
- Yeah.

1329
01:18:38,131 --> 01:18:40,350
No! Gargamel's more powerful than ever.

1330
01:18:40,467 --> 01:18:43,471
Papa said no matter what happens
we're not to go back for him.

1331
01:18:43,637 --> 01:18:45,014
He's trying to protect us.

1332
01:18:45,138 --> 01:18:48,642
- No! We can't leave Papa behind.
- It was a Smurf promise.

1333
01:18:48,767 --> 01:18:50,110
No, no, no. We can't.

1334
01:18:50,185 --> 01:18:53,155
We promised Papa
we'd do exactly what he said.

1335
01:18:53,271 --> 01:18:55,114
- That's right.
- I didn't.

1336
01:18:56,983 --> 01:18:58,826
I never promised him anything.

1337
01:18:59,110 --> 01:19:02,990
Neither did I. And there is no way
I'm leaving here without Papa.

1338
01:19:05,033 --> 01:19:07,627
Patrick, wait. I'm coming with you.

1339
01:19:11,122 --> 01:19:12,499
I'm in.

1340
01:19:16,169 --> 01:19:18,012
Aye. Me, too.

1341
01:19:20,173 --> 01:19:24,303
No Smurf left behind! Not Papa, and not you.

1342
01:19:25,178 --> 01:19:28,182
- All for one and one for Smurf!
- All for one and one for Smurf!

1343
01:19:33,561 --> 01:19:36,485
I 'll squeeze a few
And tweeze a few

1344
01:19:36,564 --> 01:19:39,033
And steal their essence blue

1345
01:19:42,237 --> 01:19:46,037
Very impressive, my dear, sweet little Papa!

1346
01:19:49,869 --> 01:19:51,667
Oh, look at this.

1347
01:19:52,205 --> 01:19:59,259
Just a tiny little bit of your little tiny beard
yields me all of this essence.

1348
01:20:00,088 --> 01:20:05,936
Just imagine what I'll be able to harvest
from your entire family of Smurfs.

1349
01:20:06,428 --> 01:20:08,180
Alakazookas!

1350
01:20:11,182 --> 01:20:15,403
Behold my glorious Smurf magic machine!

1351
01:20:19,232 --> 01:20:23,078
No. No! The cages! No! No!

1352
01:20:24,112 --> 01:20:27,742
I'll steam the essence from their sweat.
I'll tug it from their tears!

1353
01:20:27,949 --> 01:20:30,043
I'll snip it from their hair.

1354
01:20:31,244 --> 01:20:33,372
You're a fool, Gargamel.

1355
01:20:33,455 --> 01:20:36,459
My Smurfs are well on their way home
by now.

1356
01:21:01,775 --> 01:21:04,403
Oh, yeah. Let's light this candle.

1357
01:21:10,617 --> 01:21:12,335
Good luck, Gutsy!

1358
01:21:13,078 --> 01:21:16,628
- Into the breach!
- I'll see you there!

1359
01:21:27,133 --> 01:21:30,979
- We all remember the plan, right?
- Let's get our smurf on.

1360
01:21:31,471 --> 01:21:32,688
Brainy, what's happening?

1361
01:21:32,972 --> 01:21:36,818
I've added the ingredients.
It's more powerful than anticipated.

1362
01:21:36,935 --> 01:21:38,357
I don't think I can do it.

1363
01:21:38,478 --> 01:21:42,153
Okay, Brainy, you can do this.
Just say the incantation.

1364
01:21:59,124 --> 01:22:00,501
I'll be smurf ed!

1365
01:22:01,793 --> 01:22:05,639
I did it. I did it, Papa! I did it!

1366
01:22:09,134 --> 01:22:11,637
- I don't believe it!
- Wow.

1367
01:22:12,011 --> 01:22:14,685
- It's the Anjelou moon.
- How did she do that?

1368
01:22:15,306 --> 01:22:17,479
- It's beautiful.
- Oh, Odile.

1369
01:22:17,976 --> 01:22:20,570
- Oh, wow.
- That's wonderful.

1370
01:22:28,862 --> 01:22:31,160
Now, I don't want you to worry, Papa.

1371
01:22:31,239 --> 01:22:34,743
That which doesn't kill you
only makes me stronger.

1372
01:22:36,744 --> 01:22:38,337
- Yo!
- Huh?

1373
01:22:38,580 --> 01:22:41,049
Gargamel! Come out and play!

1374
01:22:41,207 --> 01:22:44,882
Oh, I think our tiny little guests
have finally arrived.

1375
01:22:45,211 --> 01:22:46,463
- No!
- Ah, well.

1376
01:22:46,546 --> 01:22:49,049
Enjoy the ride, Papa!

1377
01:22:50,717 --> 01:22:52,685
And remember, keep your hands and feet

1378
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:55,809
- inside the cart at all times.
- No. No! No!

1379
01:22:55,889 --> 01:22:57,766
Smurfs, run!

1380
01:22:59,559 --> 01:23:01,232
Smurfs.

1381
01:23:06,858 --> 01:23:10,613
You have our Papa. Prepare to get smurfed!

1382
01:23:10,737 --> 01:23:12,410
Yeah, what he said.

1383
01:23:12,530 --> 01:23:14,032
Adorable.

1384
01:23:14,115 --> 01:23:17,745
Two little smurfs come to save
their beloved Papa.

1385
01:23:18,077 --> 01:23:19,579
Hey, Gargamel.

1386
01:23:20,246 --> 01:23:23,045
Make that three little smurfs.

1387
01:23:27,128 --> 01:23:30,052
And I went home and got a few friends.

1388
01:23:51,110 --> 01:23:52,657
MY, my, my!

1389
01:23:53,488 --> 01:23:55,115
I think the whole village must be here.

1390
01:23:56,616 --> 01:24:01,247
Whatever will I do with all this essence?

1391
01:24:01,788 --> 01:24:03,165
On me, boys.

1392
01:24:04,749 --> 01:24:05,796
Fire!

1393
01:24:05,917 --> 01:24:08,261
Let's get this hoedown started!

1394
01:24:08,836 --> 01:24:11,885
There comes a time
when every Smurf must stand up...

1395
01:24:11,965 --> 01:24:13,091
Watch it, you little hoodlums!

1396
01:24:13,174 --> 01:24:16,553
For what is good and cute and blue
in the world.

1397
01:24:16,636 --> 01:24:20,391
And on this brisk New York night,
that time is now.

1398
01:24:20,473 --> 01:24:22,146
Hey! Seriously?

1399
01:24:22,267 --> 01:24:24,645
Sorry, it's kind of what I do.

1400
01:24:27,647 --> 01:24:29,149
Eat yolk, Gargamel!

1401
01:24:32,110 --> 01:24:33,657
Patrick, can you do it?

1402
01:24:33,778 --> 01:24:34,825
Go, go, go!

1403
01:24:35,196 --> 01:24:36,493
Hurry, they can't hold out for long.

1404
01:24:38,700 --> 01:24:43,376
You know, one bad apple
can ruin your whole day.

1405
01:24:45,957 --> 01:24:47,709
Full smurf ahead!

1406
01:24:48,001 --> 01:24:49,378
Come on!

1407
01:24:51,629 --> 01:24:54,553
Hey, Gargamel,
here's a little souvenir from the Big Apple.

1408
01:24:58,177 --> 01:25:00,555
- Out of the frying pan...
- And into the...

1409
01:25:00,805 --> 01:25:01,806
- Fire.
- Fire.

1410
01:25:01,889 --> 01:25:03,732
I'm too beautiful to die!

1411
01:25:14,027 --> 01:25:15,028
Oh, Papa.

1412
01:25:15,278 --> 01:25:17,121
No. No, Smurfette.

1413
01:25:17,196 --> 01:25:19,119
What did he do to you?

1414
01:25:19,198 --> 01:25:20,324
You shouldn't have come back for me.

1415
01:25:20,408 --> 01:25:22,410
Papa, I'm getting you out of here right now.

1416
01:25:26,956 --> 01:25:28,003
Smurfette!

1417
01:25:28,082 --> 01:25:30,050
Hang on, Papa, I'll be back.

1418
01:25:33,588 --> 01:25:34,885
Charge!

1419
01:25:34,964 --> 01:25:36,011
Get him!

1420
01:25:36,090 --> 01:25:37,182
Grab the wand!

1421
01:25:37,258 --> 01:25:38,475
- Goin' in!
- Go!

1422
01:25:41,804 --> 01:25:42,851
Bombs away!

1423
01:25:42,930 --> 01:25:45,399
- I'm going for a strike!
- Alakazam!

1424
01:25:46,934 --> 01:25:48,607
- Crikey.
- Look out, Gutsy!

1425
01:25:49,937 --> 01:25:51,314
Oh, ya blinkin' flip!

1426
01:25:54,651 --> 01:25:55,823
Hang on, Papa.

1427
01:25:59,447 --> 01:26:00,494
Onions!

1428
01:26:02,950 --> 01:26:04,122
Get back, cat.

1429
01:26:10,750 --> 01:26:12,002
Here, kitty, kitty...

1430
01:26:14,921 --> 01:26:16,093
Smurfette!

1431
01:26:18,841 --> 01:26:20,093
Looking for me?

1432
01:26:20,593 --> 01:26:22,140
Play time is over!

1433
01:26:22,637 --> 01:26:26,312
Behold the awesome power of me!

1434
01:26:56,045 --> 01:26:57,137
Smurfette?

1435
01:26:57,296 --> 01:26:58,843
Had enough, huh?

1436
01:26:59,173 --> 01:27:00,299
You're mine, kitty.

1437
01:27:04,137 --> 01:27:06,139
I'm done smurfing around.

1438
01:27:15,815 --> 01:27:18,034
You smurf ed with the wrong girl.

1439
01:27:22,238 --> 01:27:23,740
- I got you, Greedy.
- Oh, my cupcake!

1440
01:27:27,702 --> 01:27:29,170
What's happening, Papa?

1441
01:27:29,495 --> 01:27:30,496
No!

1442
01:27:31,664 --> 01:27:34,338
Gargamel!

1443
01:27:35,376 --> 01:27:38,175
Not so fast, goody blue-shoes.

1444
01:27:38,671 --> 01:27:40,173
Oh, Papa!

1445
01:27:41,674 --> 01:27:45,224
Now, it's time to break their little blue wills.

1446
01:27:45,678 --> 01:27:48,522
- No.
- Are you watching closely, Smurfs?

1447
01:27:48,848 --> 01:27:51,567
- Papa!
- Your beloved little Papa

1448
01:27:51,684 --> 01:27:55,029
is about to meet his little blue end.

1449
01:27:55,104 --> 01:27:56,151
No!

1450
01:27:56,230 --> 01:27:57,698
Upsy-daisy!

1451
01:27:57,857 --> 01:27:59,530
Oh, no. Papa!

1452
01:27:59,609 --> 01:28:00,701
Papa!

1453
01:28:04,697 --> 01:28:07,792
No! No!

1454
01:28:07,867 --> 01:28:08,959
You again!

1455
01:28:09,035 --> 01:28:10,207
Goodbye!

1456
01:28:11,287 --> 01:28:12,379
I'm really...

1457
01:28:12,872 --> 01:28:15,876
This ends here, this ends now!

1458
01:28:15,958 --> 01:28:17,756
Really going to enjoy this.

1459
01:28:18,044 --> 01:28:19,216
Gotcha!

1460
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:21,305
Freedom!

1461
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:22,927
Son of a smurf!

1462
01:28:23,132 --> 01:28:24,475
Come back here!

1463
01:28:24,550 --> 01:28:26,723
Go, Gutsy! Yeah!

1464
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:30,473
Come back here right now with my wand!

1465
01:28:31,891 --> 01:28:33,939
Oh, no. Crikey.

1466
01:28:37,772 --> 01:28:39,900
I... I got it.

1467
01:28:40,233 --> 01:28:42,327
- Oh, dear.
- Clumsy.

1468
01:28:42,401 --> 01:28:45,826
- So this is how it ends.
- Our goose is cooked.

1469
01:28:48,491 --> 01:28:50,960
- This is not gonna be good.
- We're doomed.

1470
01:28:51,619 --> 01:28:53,417
I got it! I got it!

1471
01:28:54,747 --> 01:28:57,466
The vision's never been wrong.

1472
01:29:10,263 --> 01:29:11,606
I got it!

1473
01:29:13,474 --> 01:29:16,273
My wand! Give me back my wand!

1474
01:29:31,325 --> 01:29:32,622
How dare you!

1475
01:29:34,662 --> 01:29:38,633
How dare you defy the great and powerful...

1476
01:29:43,629 --> 01:29:44,721
Oh, my God.

1477
01:29:44,797 --> 01:29:46,470
Smurfs!

1478
01:29:51,137 --> 01:29:52,730
Are you dead?

1479
01:29:57,310 --> 01:29:59,563
- Nice one, Clumsy!
- Are you kidding me?

1480
01:29:59,645 --> 01:30:01,238
- Get up here, you!
- Yeah!

1481
01:30:01,981 --> 01:30:04,530
Bravo! Danke schön, Clumsy!

1482
01:30:05,234 --> 01:30:06,827
- Patrick.
- Hey.

1483
01:30:07,194 --> 01:30:10,664
Clumsy! Clumsy! Clumsy! Clumsy!

1484
01:30:13,492 --> 01:30:15,745
Clumsy, you're a hero.

1485
01:30:15,828 --> 01:30:17,045
I'm a hero?

1486
01:30:17,204 --> 01:30:18,376
Yeah. Yeah.

1487
01:30:18,831 --> 01:30:23,678
I'm a hero! I'm so sorry, guys.
Definitely killed the moment.

1488
01:30:24,378 --> 01:30:27,848
- Clumsy, you little mook, you.
- It's Papa.

1489
01:30:29,050 --> 01:30:31,348
I owe you an apology, Clumsy.

1490
01:30:31,719 --> 01:30:35,019
I believed more in a vision than I did in you.

1491
01:30:36,349 --> 01:30:38,192
I'm so proud of you, Clumsy.

1492
01:30:38,517 --> 01:30:40,019
Thanks, Papa.

1493
01:30:40,853 --> 01:30:43,356
I promised myself I wouldn't cry.

1494
01:30:43,606 --> 01:30:45,950
And now to get rid of this!

1495
01:30:51,447 --> 01:30:54,917
To the portal, everyone!
There's no time to spare.

1496
01:30:55,534 --> 01:30:57,707
- Smurf y'all later!
- Bye.

1497
01:31:00,039 --> 01:31:01,666
I'm not one for long goodbyes,

1498
01:31:01,749 --> 01:31:05,253
but I did smurf together a few words
I'd like to say.

1499
01:31:05,378 --> 01:31:06,470
- Bye.
- Take care.

1500
01:31:06,545 --> 01:31:09,765
I hated this. So much less than I expected.

1501
01:31:10,091 --> 01:31:13,766
- Bye, Grouchy.
- Don't get me wrong, I still hated it. Just less.

1502
01:31:13,886 --> 01:31:19,063
I'll not soon forget this place.
Especially not with these! Tallyho!

1503
01:31:19,642 --> 01:31:22,441
I shall be back, Broadway. Tootles!

1504
01:31:22,561 --> 01:31:24,404
- Hey, girlfriend.
- Wow.

1505
01:31:25,064 --> 01:31:27,317
I've never had a girlfriend before.

1506
01:31:29,485 --> 01:31:32,830
- I'll never forget you.
- Smurfette.

1507
01:31:34,073 --> 01:31:35,074
High four.

1508
01:31:37,118 --> 01:31:38,916
High four, Grace.

1509
01:31:40,246 --> 01:31:42,123
- Hey, Smurfette.
- And you.

1510
01:31:42,248 --> 01:31:44,296
- Hi.
- You, the little hero, come here.

1511
01:31:44,917 --> 01:31:46,919
Hero? Stop.

1512
01:31:47,586 --> 01:31:49,964
Well, actually, you mind saying
it one more time?

1513
01:31:50,089 --> 01:31:51,636
It's kinda got a nice ring to it.

1514
01:31:57,304 --> 01:32:00,433
- Bye, Grace.
- Well, Master Winslow, thank you.

1515
01:32:01,100 --> 01:32:03,102
- You saved me.
- So long!

1516
01:32:03,644 --> 01:32:05,271
You saved my whole family.

1517
01:32:05,479 --> 01:32:08,608
Actually I think it was the other way around.

1518
01:32:09,108 --> 01:32:13,113
Well, I should get going.
I've got a Smurf village to rebuild.

1519
01:32:13,446 --> 01:32:15,665
Your village has given me some ideas.

1520
01:32:16,949 --> 01:32:18,292
Come here.

1521
01:32:27,334 --> 01:32:28,881
Goodbye, Papa.

1522
01:32:29,628 --> 01:32:31,972
Goodbye, Papa.

1523
01:32:38,888 --> 01:32:40,481
Let's go home.

1524
01:32:43,642 --> 01:32:47,738
And so, the Smurfs left
the strange city of New York,

1525
01:32:48,314 --> 01:32:52,615
and I think they left it a little sweeter,
a little wiser,

1526
01:32:52,693 --> 01:32:54,912
a little smurfier.

1527
01:32:54,987 --> 01:32:57,661
And as that portal began to close
for the last time...

1528
01:32:57,740 --> 01:32:59,913
Hey! Seriously, stop!

1529
01:33:00,910 --> 01:33:02,833
Bye, New York!

1530
01:33:12,671 --> 01:33:14,844
It's Odile. Hey, Odile.

1531
01:33:14,924 --> 01:33:17,347
Patrick, I just called to say thank you.

1532
01:33:18,552 --> 01:33:20,850
Finally someone has given me what I want.

1533
01:33:28,687 --> 01:33:29,859
I think I'm not fired.

1534
01:33:31,273 --> 01:33:32,365
Wow!

1535
01:33:36,362 --> 01:33:39,957
Wow. So that's a new job, new baby,

1536
01:33:41,534 --> 01:33:43,628
some unique new friends...

1537
01:33:48,415 --> 01:33:50,588
- You know if you really want a bigger place.
- Bigger?

1538
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:53,964
Are you crazy? Then we'll be further apart.

1539
01:33:59,552 --> 01:34:00,599
Oh, Grace...

1540
01:34:03,889 --> 01:34:05,232
I smurf you.

1541
01:36:04,343 --> 01:36:06,562
Smurfs. Smurfs!

1542
01:36:11,183 --> 01:36:14,232
I wish I could quit you. Get out of here.

1543
01:36:17,940 --> 01:36:19,692
What are you looking at?
