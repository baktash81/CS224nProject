1
00:00:50,132 --> 00:00:54,262
<i>...what has turned into
a classic Formula 1 season.</i>

2
00:00:55,892 --> 00:00:57,860
<i>With the weather conditions
so uncertain,</i>

3
00:00:57,972 --> 00:00:59,178
<i>the drivers prepare for...</i>

4
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:03,814
<i>...the track is still dangerously wet,</i>

5
00:01:03,852 --> 00:01:05,263
<i>but following a drivers' meeting,</i>

6
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:08,415
<i>- a decision has finally been taken.
- Three minutes to go.</i>

7
00:01:09,092 --> 00:01:11,174
<i>Everybody off the grid now.</i>

8
00:01:25,172 --> 00:01:29,257
<i>Twenty-five drivers
start every season in Formula 1,</i>

9
00:01:29,332 --> 00:01:32,415
<i>and each year two of us die.</i>

10
00:01:33,172 --> 00:01:35,539
<i>What kind of person
does a job like this?</i>

11
00:01:36,692 --> 00:01:38,694
<i>Not normal men, for sure.</i>

12
00:01:38,772 --> 00:01:43,016
<i>Rebels, lunatics, dreamers.</i>

13
00:01:43,692 --> 00:01:46,093
<i>People who are desperate to make a mark</i>

14
00:01:46,212 --> 00:01:48,453
<i>and are prepared to die trying.</i>

15
00:01:50,532 --> 00:01:51,897
<i>My name is Niki Lauda,</i>

16
00:01:52,252 --> 00:01:55,381
<i>and racing people
know me for two things.</i>

17
00:01:55,452 --> 00:01:59,218
<i>The first is my rivalry with him.</i>

18
00:02:03,372 --> 00:02:06,296
<i>Photographers,
please clear the grid.</i>

19
00:02:06,812 --> 00:02:08,780
What about Hunt? Has he changed?

20
00:02:09,052 --> 00:02:10,497
No, he's going on wets.

21
00:02:10,572 --> 00:02:13,735
<i>I don't know
why it became such a big thing.</i>

22
00:02:13,772 --> 00:02:17,140
<i>We were just drivers
busting each other's balls.</i>

23
00:02:18,132 --> 00:02:20,578
<i>To me this is perfectly normal,</i>

24
00:02:20,652 --> 00:02:22,814
<i>but other people saw it differently,</i>

25
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:25,816
<i>that whatever it was between us
went deeper.</i>

26
00:02:42,092 --> 00:02:44,094
<i>The other thing I'm remembered for</i>

27
00:02:44,172 --> 00:02:47,938
<i>is what happened on 1st August, 1976,</i>

28
00:02:48,012 --> 00:02:49,537
<i>when I was chasing him</i>

29
00:02:49,612 --> 00:02:51,694
<i>like an asshole.</i>

30
00:03:22,212 --> 00:03:23,657
Trauma trolley, please.

31
00:03:23,732 --> 00:03:26,133
Hello, I think the racetrack
telephoned ahead that I was coming.

32
00:03:26,212 --> 00:03:27,657
Hunt. James Hunt.

33
00:03:32,732 --> 00:03:35,815
What's the matter? No one ever seen
a spot of blood before?

34
00:03:36,172 --> 00:03:38,823
- Are you all right?
- Absolutely fine.

35
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,861
We all thought
you'd been in an accident.

36
00:03:43,972 --> 00:03:45,019
I have.

37
00:03:45,172 --> 00:03:48,335
If you call a friendly disagreement
with another driver an accident.

38
00:03:54,492 --> 00:03:56,256
What did you disagree about?

39
00:03:56,332 --> 00:03:57,902
It's none of your business.

40
00:03:58,012 --> 00:04:00,014
Sorry.

41
00:04:01,012 --> 00:04:02,377
His wife.

42
00:04:04,412 --> 00:04:06,938
That's going to need a couple
of stitches. It's a nasty cut.

43
00:04:07,012 --> 00:04:10,095
It was a nasty blow.
Done with a bloody crowbar.

44
00:04:11,012 --> 00:04:13,777
- Why? What did you do?
- Nothing.

45
00:04:14,372 --> 00:04:16,613
Only what she asked me to do.

46
00:04:18,852 --> 00:04:20,377
Which was...

47
00:04:21,012 --> 00:04:23,538
I'd be happy to show you, if you like.

48
00:04:26,732 --> 00:04:29,019
Oh! Sorry.

49
00:04:29,132 --> 00:04:32,932
<i>I have a theory
why women like racing drivers.</i>

50
00:04:33,292 --> 00:04:35,613
<i>It's not because
they respect what we do,</i>

51
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,502
<i>driving round and round in circles.</i>

52
00:04:38,572 --> 00:04:41,143
<i>Mostly they think that's pathetic,
and they're probably right.</i>

53
00:04:42,372 --> 00:04:44,454
<i>It's our closeness to death.</i>

54
00:04:45,292 --> 00:04:48,978
<i>You see, the closer you are to death,
the more alive you feel.</i>

55
00:04:49,052 --> 00:04:52,056
<i>The more alive you are.
And they can see that in you.</i>

56
00:04:52,132 --> 00:04:54,055
<i>They feel that in you.</i>

57
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:57,453
<i>My name is James Hunt.</i>

58
00:04:57,572 --> 00:04:59,574
<i>My father is a stockbroker,</i>

59
00:04:59,612 --> 00:05:03,219
<i>my sister is a barrister
and my brother is an accountant.</i>

60
00:05:04,292 --> 00:05:05,737
<i>And I...</i>

61
00:05:06,252 --> 00:05:07,902
<i>Well, I do this.</i>

62
00:05:09,412 --> 00:05:10,937
<i>It's a wonderful way to live.</i>

63
00:05:11,092 --> 00:05:13,140
<i>It's the only way to drive.</i>

64
00:05:14,092 --> 00:05:16,493
<i>As if each day is your last.</i>

65
00:05:25,772 --> 00:05:28,252
I've never been to a Grand Prix before.

66
00:05:28,332 --> 00:05:30,175
Oh, you still haven't.

67
00:05:30,252 --> 00:05:32,778
- This is Formula 3.
- What's that?

68
00:05:33,612 --> 00:05:35,853
It's a lower division,

69
00:05:35,932 --> 00:05:38,458
where idiots like me mess about

70
00:05:38,852 --> 00:05:41,537
in the hope of being talent-spotted
to race in Formula 1.

71
00:05:41,612 --> 00:05:43,614
- You look disappointed.
- No.

72
00:05:44,092 --> 00:05:47,301
Ah. You only slept with me
because you thought I was famous.

73
00:05:47,372 --> 00:05:48,942
That's not true.

74
00:05:49,612 --> 00:05:51,614
Don't worry. I will be one day.

75
00:05:51,692 --> 00:05:53,296
Morning, everyone.

76
00:05:53,332 --> 00:05:54,936
- This is Nursie.
- Gemma.

77
00:05:55,612 --> 00:05:58,456
Nursie, this is Bubbles Horsley,
team manager.

78
00:05:58,532 --> 00:05:59,613
How do you do?

79
00:06:00,012 --> 00:06:01,776
- Bubbles?
- Yeah.

80
00:06:01,812 --> 00:06:04,816
- Doc Postlethwaite, our designer.
- How do you do?

81
00:06:04,892 --> 00:06:08,817
And Alexander, Lord Hesketh,
the team's owner.

82
00:06:09,852 --> 00:06:11,342
How do you do?

83
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:13,662
Fine, thanks.

84
00:06:13,692 --> 00:06:15,581
<i>Well done, Superstar.</i>

85
00:06:15,652 --> 00:06:18,178
- That's the car?
- Yep, that's her.

86
00:06:18,292 --> 00:06:20,021
Lotus 59.

87
00:06:20,132 --> 00:06:22,863
1,000cc Cosworth MAE engine.

88
00:06:22,972 --> 00:06:25,816
She's no beauty,
but goes like the clappers.

89
00:06:32,372 --> 00:06:34,420
Nothing to be worried about.
Does it before every race.

90
00:06:34,492 --> 00:06:36,574
Good sign, actually. Means he's stoked.

91
00:06:36,652 --> 00:06:40,862
<i>AH Formula 3 cars
to the assembly area now, please.</i>

92
00:06:52,572 --> 00:06:55,781
<i>...drivers please bring them
to the scrutineering bay now.</i>

93
00:06:56,172 --> 00:06:57,742
All right, Superstar?

94
00:06:57,852 --> 00:06:59,536
Never better, patron.

95
00:06:59,572 --> 00:07:02,052
- Have a gargle with this.
- Thank you.

96
00:07:03,532 --> 00:07:04,943
Quick toke of this.

97
00:07:05,852 --> 00:07:08,742
<i>At Crystal Palace today,
James Hunt's on pole,</i>

98
00:07:09,572 --> 00:07:12,860
<i>with Austrian newcomer
Niki Lauda alongside him</i>

99
00:07:12,892 --> 00:07:15,543
<i>and Dave Walker completing Row 1.</i>

100
00:07:15,612 --> 00:07:18,092
<i>Row 2 is Mike Beuttler and Dave Morgan,</i>

101
00:07:18,212 --> 00:07:21,102
<i>- with Tony Trimmer and Gerry Birrell.
- Who's that?</i>

102
00:07:21,452 --> 00:07:22,977
<i>He's new.</i>

103
00:07:23,452 --> 00:07:26,296
- Some German.
- Austrian.

104
00:07:26,372 --> 00:07:29,455
He's been here since 5:00 am,
walking the track.

105
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,899
You might actually
have to concentrate today, James.

106
00:07:31,972 --> 00:07:33,576
You'll need these.

107
00:07:34,252 --> 00:07:36,823
<i>-  Okay, start her up.</i>

108
00:07:36,892 --> 00:07:39,372
Ah! What music!

109
00:07:39,412 --> 00:07:40,902
They could never have imagined it,

110
00:07:40,972 --> 00:07:43,259
those pioneers
who invented the automobile,

111
00:07:43,372 --> 00:07:47,582
that it would possess us like this,
in our imaginations, in our dreams.

112
00:07:48,332 --> 00:07:50,619
Nursie, men love women,

113
00:07:50,732 --> 00:07:52,496
but even more than that,

114
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:55,894
men love cars.

115
00:08:03,012 --> 00:08:06,175
- Come on, James!
- James! Come on, James!

116
00:08:07,172 --> 00:08:08,583
Go, James!

117
00:08:16,252 --> 00:08:17,413
<i>Hunt's still in the lead,</i>

118
00:08:17,492 --> 00:08:19,654
<i>but Niki Lauda is right on his tail.</i>

119
00:08:28,452 --> 00:08:31,296
<i>Hunt and Lauda are
proving to be in a class of their own.</i>

120
00:08:31,332 --> 00:08:32,936
<i>They're leaving the pack far behind.</i>

121
00:08:33,332 --> 00:08:34,936
<i>Herr Red Devil's on his tail.</i>

122
00:08:41,052 --> 00:08:43,054
<i>Lauda takes a look down the inside...</i>

123
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:46,456
<i>...and he's sold him a dummy!</i>

124
00:08:49,972 --> 00:08:51,974
<i>Lauda is through! He's in the lead!</i>

125
00:08:52,812 --> 00:08:55,213
<i>Hunt will be determined
to make up for that mistake.</i>

126
00:09:01,972 --> 00:09:03,542
<i>Hunt's in Lauda's slipstream.</i>

127
00:09:03,652 --> 00:09:05,620
<i>Lauda's not leaving any gap.</i>

128
00:09:10,732 --> 00:09:14,737
<i>The Lotus goes for the inside.
It's an aggressive move from Hunt.</i>

129
00:09:18,812 --> 00:09:20,735
<i>Oh! There's contact!</i>

130
00:09:27,492 --> 00:09:30,735
<i>The leaders have spun out!
Lauda's facing the wrong way!</i>

131
00:09:31,332 --> 00:09:33,699
<i>The back marker's gone through.</i>

132
00:09:34,052 --> 00:09:35,656
<i>You can see why Hunt's fellow drivers</i>

133
00:09:35,732 --> 00:09:37,573
<i>- call him "Hunt the Shunt".</i>

134
00:09:41,012 --> 00:09:42,013
Asshole!

135
00:09:42,092 --> 00:09:43,856
- Go on, James!
- The Kraut's out of it.

136
00:09:44,172 --> 00:09:46,095
<i>Lauda is clearly furious.</i>

137
00:09:46,172 --> 00:09:49,619
<i>There's every reason
to expect sharp words in the pits.</i>

138
00:09:49,692 --> 00:09:51,581
<i>It's gonna be victory for Hunt.</i>

139
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:55,014
<i>It's gonna be an ignominious defeat
for Niki Lauda.</i>

140
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:03,623
<i>So James Hunt scores his
third major Formula 3 win of the season</i>

141
00:10:03,692 --> 00:10:04,932
<i>here at Crystal Palace,</i>

142
00:10:05,052 --> 00:10:07,783
<i>after a desperate battle
with Niki Lauda.</i>

143
00:10:07,852 --> 00:10:09,581
<i>Lauda was unable to restart</i>

144
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:12,423
<i>after Hunt's aggressive move
caused them both to spin out</i>

145
00:10:12,532 --> 00:10:13,693
<i>in the last lap of the race.</i>

146
00:10:15,132 --> 00:10:16,812
Hard luck.
Better luck next time.

147
00:10:17,372 --> 00:10:18,897
Hey, asshole.

148
00:10:19,972 --> 00:10:22,134
That was my line. I had that corner.

149
00:10:22,212 --> 00:10:25,455
Do you mean the one that you spun out of
and finished facing the other way?

150
00:10:25,572 --> 00:10:27,893
I think that corner had you.

151
00:10:27,972 --> 00:10:30,498
That move was total suicide.
What if I hadn't braked?

152
00:10:30,572 --> 00:10:33,416
- We'd have crashed.
- But we didn't, did we?

153
00:10:33,452 --> 00:10:35,420
Thanks to your impeccable
survival instincts.

154
00:10:37,572 --> 00:10:39,415
Fuck you. What's your name?

155
00:10:41,052 --> 00:10:45,421
James Simon Wallis Hunt.
Remember it, my little Jerry friend.

156
00:10:45,772 --> 00:10:47,422
<i>Jawohl. Remember ze name.</i>

157
00:10:47,452 --> 00:10:50,262
And it's very simple. Hunt.
It rhymes with...

158
00:10:50,292 --> 00:10:51,418
...cunt.

159
00:10:51,492 --> 00:10:53,972
A word that happens
to describe you perfectly!

160
00:10:54,572 --> 00:10:56,017
Who was that?

161
00:10:56,092 --> 00:10:58,254
I've no idea.
He looks like a rat, doesn't he?

162
00:11:00,572 --> 00:11:02,017
<i>In my home town, Vienna,</i>

163
00:11:02,452 --> 00:11:05,774
<i>my family is famous
for one thing - business.</i>

164
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,619
<i>My grandfather was a businessman,</i>

165
00:11:09,092 --> 00:11:10,537
<i>my father, too.</i>

166
00:11:11,332 --> 00:11:14,461
<i>So when they heard I wanted
to race cars for a living,</i>

167
00:11:14,532 --> 00:11:16,341
<i>they had a few things to say.</i>

168
00:11:41,452 --> 00:11:42,817
<i>Gut.</i>

169
00:12:03,492 --> 00:12:05,494
<i>So if my family
wasn't going to help me,</i>

170
00:12:05,652 --> 00:12:09,338
<i>I decided to risk everything
and take out a loan myself.</i>

171
00:12:09,412 --> 00:12:12,382
<i>I found a Formula 1 team
with an okay car</i>

172
00:12:12,492 --> 00:12:14,540
<i>and an owner who had run out of money</i>

173
00:12:14,652 --> 00:12:16,814
<i>and was willing to accept my terms.</i>

174
00:12:17,212 --> 00:12:18,896
<i>And so,
ladies and gentlemen,</i>

175
00:12:19,012 --> 00:12:20,776
I'm delighted to say

176
00:12:20,852 --> 00:12:24,379
that the winner of the Guild of Motoring
Writers Award Driver of the Year...

177
00:12:25,572 --> 00:12:26,573
is James Hunt.

178
00:12:30,492 --> 00:12:31,937
Superb news!

179
00:12:32,692 --> 00:12:34,854
- Well done, James.
- Superstar!

180
00:12:35,012 --> 00:12:36,457
Fantastic!

181
00:12:38,012 --> 00:12:40,219
- Well done. Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.

182
00:12:40,372 --> 00:12:41,453
Yes!

183
00:12:41,532 --> 00:12:42,863
Erm...

184
00:12:42,892 --> 00:12:45,702
You know, my parents
always wanted me to be a doctor...

185
00:12:45,852 --> 00:12:47,900
...or a stockbroker or something.

186
00:12:48,012 --> 00:12:49,696
They gave me the first-class education,

187
00:12:49,772 --> 00:12:51,854
but, well, that all went terribly wrong

188
00:12:51,932 --> 00:12:53,972
and I ended up with you lot.

189
00:12:56,772 --> 00:12:58,292
Thank you. I need it more than you do.

190
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:04,098
I mean, I have a hot head,
an inability to tolerate discipline.

191
00:13:04,212 --> 00:13:05,577
- Yes!
- Very true.

192
00:13:06,292 --> 00:13:08,135
I fall out with people left and right.

193
00:13:08,772 --> 00:13:11,821
The only creatures I've ever really
loved or have treated honourably

194
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:13,894
are budgerigars.

195
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:19,217
So in any normal area of life I'd be...
or I am, a total liability.

196
00:13:19,572 --> 00:13:21,892
The only thing I've got going for me
is I'm quick in a car.

197
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:24,012
So, thank you for this
and for acknowledging that.

198
00:13:24,052 --> 00:13:25,497
I'm going to give it to my father

199
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:27,336
and tell him to put it
on the mantelpiece

200
00:13:27,412 --> 00:13:29,733
and imagine it's a first-class degree
in medicine.

201
00:13:45,092 --> 00:13:46,935
Well done, Superstar.

202
00:13:46,972 --> 00:13:49,578
Another season like that
and I'll move you up to the big time.

203
00:13:49,692 --> 00:13:51,262
Come on, you don't think I'm ready now?

204
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:54,700
You are. I'm not.
I've got to find you a car first.

205
00:13:54,852 --> 00:13:57,173
Well, go on, then. Chop-chop.

206
00:13:57,252 --> 00:13:59,539
Don't wait too long. You don't want him
to do what Lauda just did.

207
00:13:59,612 --> 00:14:02,616
- Why? What did he do?
- Got himself a drive with BRM.

208
00:14:02,652 --> 00:14:04,859
Well, how the hell did he do that?
He's a nobody.

209
00:14:04,932 --> 00:14:06,377
He's never won a bloody thing.

210
00:14:06,452 --> 00:14:08,375
Apparently, took out a loan
and bought his way in

211
00:14:08,452 --> 00:14:10,102
with two million Austrian schillings.

212
00:14:10,172 --> 00:14:11,617
Jesus.

213
00:14:31,132 --> 00:14:34,181
Niki Lauda.
Here for pre-season testing. BRM?

214
00:14:35,692 --> 00:14:38,502
Sign the release form.
I'll let them know you're here.

215
00:14:50,252 --> 00:14:51,777
- Mr Stanley.
- Good morning.

216
00:14:51,812 --> 00:14:54,736
- Good morning.
- Good morning. Clay!

217
00:14:54,812 --> 00:14:57,497
Let me introduce you
to our number-one driver,

218
00:14:57,572 --> 00:14:59,574
Clay Regazzoni.

219
00:15:00,972 --> 00:15:02,701
- How are you?
- Good.

220
00:15:03,452 --> 00:15:06,456
- Pleasure.
- And these are your mechanics.

221
00:15:07,012 --> 00:15:11,461
They're reporting exclusively to you,
as per contract.

222
00:15:11,532 --> 00:15:13,296
Pleasure. Do you wanna see the car?

223
00:15:13,372 --> 00:15:14,817
Sure.

224
00:15:16,852 --> 00:15:18,263
Hello.

225
00:15:23,292 --> 00:15:25,738
There she is. P160.

226
00:15:26,612 --> 00:15:29,138
- Same as Regazzoni's?
- Identical in every detail.

227
00:15:30,092 --> 00:15:31,582
How much does she weigh?

228
00:15:31,732 --> 00:15:34,338
- 600 kilos.
- But that's crazy.

229
00:15:34,532 --> 00:15:37,138
- Why so heavy?
- It's a V12 engine.

230
00:15:37,212 --> 00:15:40,341
That lump weighs 190K on its own.

231
00:15:40,412 --> 00:15:42,335
Okay.

232
00:15:42,412 --> 00:15:44,699
What horsepower are you getting? 490?

233
00:15:44,772 --> 00:15:47,173
- No, no, 450.
- Well, it's not enough.

234
00:15:47,252 --> 00:15:48,663
It needs to be 500,

235
00:15:48,732 --> 00:15:50,416
and the engine
needs to be 20 kilo lighter.

236
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:51,732
We already tried.

237
00:15:51,812 --> 00:15:52,973
- Tried what?
- Everything.

238
00:15:53,172 --> 00:15:54,692
We replaced the entire exhaust system.

239
00:15:54,732 --> 00:15:58,020
- Barely made a difference.
- Are you using magnesium parts?

240
00:16:11,052 --> 00:16:12,497
Now the engine block.

241
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:15,303
Any mounting or fixing plates,
strip it out also.

242
00:16:15,612 --> 00:16:18,695
When you've done that,
we have to look at the aerodynamics,

243
00:16:18,772 --> 00:16:20,536
front and rear wing.

244
00:16:37,972 --> 00:16:40,054
Okay, thank you. Good night.

245
00:17:00,012 --> 00:17:01,457
What was Regazzoni's time?

246
00:17:03,332 --> 00:17:04,743
1253.

247
00:17:05,092 --> 00:17:07,936
Okay, now put him in my car,
and he'll go round two seconds faster.

248
00:17:08,012 --> 00:17:11,061
- Well, that's impossible.
-  No chance.

249
00:17:14,092 --> 00:17:16,379
We've been working on it all night.

250
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,500
Put Regazzoni in the car.
See what happens.

251
00:17:18,572 --> 00:17:20,415
I don't understand.
Why am I supposed to do this?

252
00:17:20,492 --> 00:17:22,852
I don't know, Clay.
He just wants you to take it for a spin.

253
00:17:25,692 --> 00:17:27,217
Gloves, please.

254
00:17:27,292 --> 00:17:28,737
'fanculo.

255
00:18:11,932 --> 00:18:14,981
- I would say we push it a bit...
- All right.

256
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,054
What did you do to the car?

257
00:18:17,132 --> 00:18:20,659
That's information I will share with you
under certain conditions only.

258
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:22,337
Go on.

259
00:18:23,412 --> 00:18:25,096
A guaranteed place in the team,

260
00:18:25,452 --> 00:18:27,972
and a paid contract on equal terms
with Regazzoni for two years.

261
00:18:29,212 --> 00:18:30,816
Are you crazy?

262
00:18:30,932 --> 00:18:34,459
Clay's a senior figure in Formula 1.
You're just a rookie.

263
00:18:34,812 --> 00:18:37,372
Well, the only reason we took you on
is because you're paying us.

264
00:18:37,652 --> 00:18:40,895
Well, as of now, if you want me to stay,
we rip up the contract.

265
00:18:40,972 --> 00:18:43,703
- I don't pay you a cent.
- That's outrageous!

266
00:18:44,212 --> 00:18:46,294
Was he quicker in my car?

267
00:18:47,012 --> 00:18:49,014
He was, wasn't he?

268
00:18:49,732 --> 00:18:51,973
Did he go two seconds faster?

269
00:18:55,612 --> 00:18:57,057
2.3.

270
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:01,900
So, have a think,

271
00:19:02,532 --> 00:19:04,773
work out your priorities
and get back to me.

272
00:19:19,772 --> 00:19:21,183
Hey, Niki.

273
00:19:23,572 --> 00:19:26,462
I know what you're going to say,
that it's none of my business.

274
00:19:26,572 --> 00:19:27,573
What?

275
00:19:28,972 --> 00:19:32,294
If it's the track manager
you're taking on your date tonight...

276
00:19:33,332 --> 00:19:34,902
It's none of your business.

277
00:19:34,972 --> 00:19:38,738
Okay, but if you want my advice,
I'd let this one go.

278
00:19:40,092 --> 00:19:43,733
I'm not questioning your taste.
She is a great girl, but...

279
00:19:45,372 --> 00:19:49,263
Agnes's last boyfriend
was a British Formula 2 driver

280
00:19:49,332 --> 00:19:51,653
who has a reputation for two things.

281
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,417
For being a little crazy on the track,

282
00:19:54,572 --> 00:19:58,736
and for going all night and all day
and all night again in bed.

283
00:19:58,852 --> 00:20:02,299
He's a good driver,
but an immortal fuck, apparently.

284
00:20:02,372 --> 00:20:05,342
I don't know about you, but
that's not an act I'd like to follow.

285
00:20:08,652 --> 00:20:10,734
But if that doesn't bother you...

286
00:20:12,652 --> 00:20:15,622
What's his name, the driver?

287
00:20:15,852 --> 00:20:17,377
Hunt. James Hunt.

288
00:20:21,492 --> 00:20:24,939
You see, you share information
and I share information.

289
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:28,499
That's what teammates are for.

290
00:20:38,732 --> 00:20:40,222
<i>Where the hell are we going?</i>

291
00:20:40,292 --> 00:20:42,579
<i>I promise
it'll be worth it.</i>

292
00:20:42,652 --> 00:20:44,097
<i>Just keep them closed.</i>

293
00:20:44,532 --> 00:20:45,977
Wait for it.

294
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:48,621
Wait for it.

295
00:20:51,972 --> 00:20:54,418
There. What do you say?

296
00:20:54,532 --> 00:20:56,102
She's Formula 1.

297
00:20:56,532 --> 00:20:58,216
Yes, she is, Superstar.

298
00:20:58,652 --> 00:21:01,462
Your brother and I got together
with the bean counters.

299
00:21:01,532 --> 00:21:02,943
And since the economics of F1

300
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:06,573
are not so significantly different
to the economics of Formula 2,

301
00:21:06,652 --> 00:21:09,053
well, we thought if we were
going to be losing money,

302
00:21:09,172 --> 00:21:12,221
we might as well be doing it on
the big roulette table in Formula 1.

303
00:21:12,292 --> 00:21:15,614
You fat, little, inbred beauty.
Come here.

304
00:21:19,932 --> 00:21:23,254
Actually, credit where it's due,
we got the idea from Niki.

305
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,455
<i>- Who?
-  Lauda.</i>

306
00:21:25,532 --> 00:21:28,297
Bought his way in, rather than
mess about in the lower divisions.

307
00:21:28,372 --> 00:21:29,942
I thought, "Bloody hell, he's right."

308
00:21:30,172 --> 00:21:33,574
No sponsorship, Superstar.
I hope you approve.

309
00:21:33,652 --> 00:21:37,657
No vulgar logos
for cigarettes or condoms.

310
00:21:38,212 --> 00:21:40,260
Just plain white with the flags. Ooh!

311
00:21:40,692 --> 00:21:43,662
And racing overalls which read,

312
00:21:44,852 --> 00:21:47,378
"Sex. Breakfast of champions."

313
00:21:50,132 --> 00:21:51,941
So, when do we start?

314
00:21:52,892 --> 00:21:55,099
- Soon as you're ready.
- Ready?

315
00:21:55,412 --> 00:21:57,983
I've been waiting for this
my whole life.

316
00:22:06,972 --> 00:22:08,940
- Hi, welcome to Watkins Glen.
- Hello!

317
00:22:09,012 --> 00:22:10,776
<i>When the season started,
people wondered</i>

318
00:22:11,092 --> 00:22:13,902
<i>whether Lord Hesketh and his team
of upper-class enthusiasts</i>

319
00:22:14,252 --> 00:22:18,655
<i>were bringing glamour
to the racing community, or just comedy.</i>

320
00:22:18,732 --> 00:22:20,814
Certainly, it was the first time
anyone had seen

321
00:22:20,892 --> 00:22:24,453
a butler serving oysters and caviar
in the pits.

322
00:22:24,532 --> 00:22:27,297
But they have made quite an impact.

323
00:22:27,372 --> 00:22:30,535
Sixth in France, fourth in Britain
and third in Holland.

324
00:22:30,612 --> 00:22:34,219
<i>AH drivers on the track,
caution flags are out.</i>

325
00:22:34,292 --> 00:22:36,374
<i>A severe crash at the Esses.</i>

326
00:22:36,692 --> 00:22:38,501
<i>Red flag.
There is a car off the track.</i>

327
00:22:38,572 --> 00:22:40,256
And reports are reaching me

328
00:22:40,332 --> 00:22:42,539
that there has been
a serious accident in qualifying.

329
00:22:42,892 --> 00:22:45,418
Er, the identity of the driver we don't
currently have at the moment,

330
00:22:45,492 --> 00:22:47,699
but, as you can tell
from all the activity

331
00:22:47,812 --> 00:22:49,416
going on behind me towards the track,

332
00:22:49,492 --> 00:22:51,893
it is clearly a grave incident indeed.

333
00:22:51,972 --> 00:22:53,383
We will, of course,
have more information for you

334
00:22:53,452 --> 00:22:54,499
as and when we get it,

335
00:22:54,612 --> 00:22:58,617
but it is the sight and sound
of Formula 1 nobody likes to see.

336
00:23:02,612 --> 00:23:04,376
- Get your hands off me.
- Hey, come on.

337
00:23:14,532 --> 00:23:15,897
<i>Drivers of top stature</i>

338
00:23:15,972 --> 00:23:17,701
<i>we've lost just in the past four seasons</i>

339
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:22,619

342
00:23:28,332 --> 00:23:30,653
<i>Formula 1 has claimed another driver.</i>

343
00:23:31,252 --> 00:23:33,539
<i>The Tyrrell team
have withdrawn from the race.</i>

344
00:23:33,652 --> 00:23:36,303
<i>Their places on the grid
will be left empty.</i>

345
00:23:36,372 --> 00:23:38,818
- Terrible.
- They should cancel the race.

346
00:23:39,052 --> 00:23:40,577
Why?

347
00:23:40,892 --> 00:23:43,338
He made a mistake,
went into the corner too fast.

348
00:23:43,452 --> 00:23:44,863
It's his fault.

349
00:23:44,932 --> 00:23:46,821
- Is that right?
- It's obvious.

350
00:23:47,212 --> 00:23:48,941
Look at the tyre marks.

351
00:23:49,332 --> 00:23:52,575
So says the nobody
who had to pay for his own drive.

352
00:23:52,652 --> 00:23:54,332
How's that working out for you,
by the way?

353
00:23:54,532 --> 00:23:57,342
Fine. How is it at the back?

354
00:23:58,252 --> 00:24:00,334
Not planning on being there for long.

355
00:24:01,212 --> 00:24:02,623
<i>Ten minutes to the warm-up lap.</i>

356
00:24:02,812 --> 00:24:04,257
<i>Ten minutes.</i>

357
00:24:07,652 --> 00:24:09,017
Arsehole.

358
00:24:10,412 --> 00:24:13,700
<i>Heading into
the Grand Hotel hairpin, second gear.</i>

359
00:24:13,772 --> 00:24:14,773
Turn in hard,

360
00:24:14,852 --> 00:24:17,503
looking for late apex,
gentle with the bar.

361
00:24:19,252 --> 00:24:22,381
Heading into Portier, second gear,
clip the apex,

362
00:24:22,492 --> 00:24:26,053
light brake, stay in second,
looking for a good exit.

363
00:24:26,412 --> 00:24:28,460
Heading through the tunnel,
gradual right,

364
00:24:28,532 --> 00:24:31,502
up through third, fourth, fifth...

365
00:24:31,572 --> 00:24:33,574
ls Alexander round?

366
00:24:34,092 --> 00:24:36,698
Er, yes, he was.

367
00:24:36,772 --> 00:24:38,376
He went back to the house
to take a call.

368
00:24:38,452 --> 00:24:40,216
He'll be back shortly.

369
00:24:40,292 --> 00:24:42,454
He only wanted to show me
his pride and joy.

370
00:24:43,412 --> 00:24:46,143
Rhymes with "boy", if you ask me.

371
00:24:46,212 --> 00:24:48,021
And "toy".

372
00:24:48,092 --> 00:24:52,302
God, it's so flimsy
for something that costs so much.

373
00:24:52,372 --> 00:24:56,377
There's no comfort,
no protection, nothing.

374
00:24:56,452 --> 00:24:59,103
No, it's just a little coffin, really.

375
00:24:59,172 --> 00:25:02,221
Surrounded by high-octane fuel in here.

376
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:05,216
Being driven round 170 miles per hour.

377
00:25:05,292 --> 00:25:08,455
To all intents and purposes,
this thing's a bomb on wheels.

378
00:25:09,612 --> 00:25:11,535
You're James, aren't you?

379
00:25:12,772 --> 00:25:14,262
Yes.

380
00:25:15,212 --> 00:25:16,941
You fit the description.

381
00:25:17,332 --> 00:25:18,743
Is that right?

382
00:25:19,972 --> 00:25:21,940
Suzy. Friend of Alex's.

383
00:25:22,052 --> 00:25:25,181
Yeah, yeah. I know exactly.

384
00:25:26,852 --> 00:25:28,342
What was the description?

385
00:25:28,412 --> 00:25:29,973
Mostly positive,
in terms of appearance.

386
00:25:30,012 --> 00:25:32,219
Negative only in terms of character.

387
00:25:32,732 --> 00:25:34,655
I've been told to avoid you.

388
00:25:35,052 --> 00:25:36,463
BY Whom?

389
00:25:36,892 --> 00:25:39,736
Alexander. He says you're a bad boy.

390
00:25:39,812 --> 00:25:42,099
Alexander doesn't know
what he's talking about.

391
00:25:42,172 --> 00:25:44,539
I was. I'm not any more.

392
00:25:44,612 --> 00:25:48,139
The new me is very professional.
Early to bed, early to rise.

393
00:25:48,212 --> 00:25:49,782
- All very dull.
- Hmm.

394
00:25:49,852 --> 00:25:51,217
But according to the team,

395
00:25:51,292 --> 00:25:53,973
"The best way to
keep beating the goose-stepper."

396
00:25:54,772 --> 00:25:56,297
Is that what you were doing
when I came in?

397
00:25:56,372 --> 00:25:59,342
Yes, visualisation techniques,
memorising the circuit,

398
00:25:59,412 --> 00:26:02,097
in this case Monaco, which is up next.

399
00:26:06,892 --> 00:26:10,055
Personally, I've always been a great
believer in getting there on the day,

400
00:26:10,132 --> 00:26:12,612
putting my foot down
and playing chicken with everyone else.

401
00:26:14,932 --> 00:26:16,377
But they don't want me
doing that any more.

402
00:26:16,452 --> 00:26:20,537
They want my body like a temple
and my mind like a monk.

403
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:24,341
And what about your soul, your heart?

404
00:26:24,412 --> 00:26:26,574
Well, they've got ideas about that, too.

405
00:26:26,652 --> 00:26:29,178
They want me to stop messing around,
settle down,

406
00:26:29,252 --> 00:26:31,493
get married
with the next nice girl I meet.

407
00:26:31,572 --> 00:26:32,983
They think it would be good for me.

408
00:26:33,452 --> 00:26:35,454
Hmm. What do you think?

409
00:26:35,812 --> 00:26:39,134
It sounds fucking awful.

410
00:26:40,252 --> 00:26:42,619
But since they're right
about most things,

411
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:45,543
- they're probably right about that, too.
- Hmm.

412
00:26:45,612 --> 00:26:48,013
You don't fancy getting married, do you?

413
00:27:13,412 --> 00:27:14,937
Suzy.

414
00:27:15,652 --> 00:27:17,063
Bravo!

415
00:27:17,412 --> 00:27:19,335
Hey, hey, hey!

416
00:27:22,892 --> 00:27:24,815
- What's going on with him?
- Nothing. Nothing.

417
00:27:25,172 --> 00:27:26,583
Didn't want to ruin your day.

418
00:27:27,172 --> 00:27:29,573
It's... It's the Kraut.

419
00:27:29,852 --> 00:27:31,422
What about him?

420
00:27:32,292 --> 00:27:34,135
He's just been signed by Ferrari.

421
00:27:34,212 --> 00:27:37,933
You're kidding me?
Jesus. How did that happen?

422
00:27:38,212 --> 00:27:39,702
Did he buy his way in there, too?

423
00:27:39,812 --> 00:27:45,376
Well, the old man took Regazzoni back
and he insisted on it, apparently.

424
00:27:45,452 --> 00:27:47,420
He says that Niki's a genius
setting up the cars.

425
00:28:06,732 --> 00:28:08,496
It's terrible. Drives like a pig.

426
00:28:09,332 --> 00:28:11,699
- Oh, you can't say that.
- Why not?

427
00:28:12,052 --> 00:28:14,100
- It's a Ferrari!
- It's a shitbox.

428
00:28:14,572 --> 00:28:17,940
It understeers like crazy and
the weight distribution is a disaster.

429
00:28:18,012 --> 00:28:21,061
It's amazing, all these facilities
and you make a piece of crap like this.

430
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:23,817
Uh!

431
00:28:52,532 --> 00:28:55,695
"Ferrari family."
"Our good friend Clay Regazzoni."

432
00:28:55,772 --> 00:28:59,254
You are family and friend
to the commendatore as long as you win.

433
00:28:59,332 --> 00:29:00,743
The minute you don't, ciao, ciao.

434
00:29:01,052 --> 00:29:05,182
I totally understand. It's business.
I would do the same.

435
00:29:05,292 --> 00:29:08,216
But it isn't
just business, is it? What we do.

436
00:29:08,292 --> 00:29:10,374
It's passion, love.

437
00:29:10,452 --> 00:29:13,217
Which is why we are prepared
to risk our lives for it.

438
00:29:13,292 --> 00:29:14,339
Not me.

439
00:29:14,412 --> 00:29:17,133
If I had more talent and could earn
better money with something else,

440
00:29:17,292 --> 00:29:18,896
I would.

441
00:29:18,972 --> 00:29:22,579
How do you know you will
make money here? You haven't yet.

442
00:29:22,652 --> 00:29:24,973
Not yet, but I will.

443
00:29:25,652 --> 00:29:27,541
If you can, I can.

444
00:29:31,412 --> 00:29:33,255
You know, are you ever not an asshole?

445
00:29:34,612 --> 00:29:36,580
- Why am I an asshole?
- Well...

446
00:29:36,652 --> 00:29:38,177
You know, by now
I'm both quicker than you

447
00:29:38,252 --> 00:29:40,095
and better at setting up the car.

448
00:29:40,172 --> 00:29:41,973
You can't deal with it,
so you're the asshole.

449
00:29:42,012 --> 00:29:43,173
Screw you.

450
00:29:51,092 --> 00:29:54,301
I brought you along today because
you seem like a lonely kind of guy.

451
00:29:54,372 --> 00:29:56,261
I thought if I introduced you
to some nice people,

452
00:29:56,332 --> 00:29:58,141
that could rub off on you.

453
00:29:58,212 --> 00:30:00,863
Forget it. Make your own friends.

454
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:03,617
Come on, Clay. I'm sorry.

455
00:30:39,132 --> 00:30:40,577
Are you leaving?

456
00:30:41,692 --> 00:30:43,103
Yes.

457
00:30:43,572 --> 00:30:45,252
Can you give me a lift
to the nearest town,

458
00:30:45,332 --> 00:30:46,777
anywhere with a train station?

459
00:30:48,572 --> 00:30:51,655
Sure. Trento's half an hour's drive.

460
00:30:52,292 --> 00:30:53,339
Get in.

461
00:31:04,692 --> 00:31:08,139
J1 Been another blue day
without you, girl

462
00:31:09,252 --> 00:31:12,779
J1 Been another sad summer song

463
00:31:14,532 --> 00:31:18,537
J1 I been thinking about you, girl,
all night long

464
00:31:20,492 --> 00:31:21,573
What are you doing?

465
00:31:21,972 --> 00:31:23,573
You hear that noise when you accelerate?

466
00:31:23,972 --> 00:31:26,259
- No.
- Your fan belt is loose.

467
00:31:26,372 --> 00:31:28,056
My What?

468
00:31:28,132 --> 00:31:30,533
And when you brake,
your foot goes all the way down,

469
00:31:30,612 --> 00:31:32,132
which means there's air in the system.

470
00:31:32,372 --> 00:31:34,943
- Anything else?
- No.

471
00:31:35,932 --> 00:31:38,697
Apart from
the rear brakes are worn out,

472
00:31:39,012 --> 00:31:40,423
the front right tyre's a bit soft,

473
00:31:40,492 --> 00:31:42,221
which explains
why you're weaving so much.

474
00:31:42,292 --> 00:31:44,772
Hmm. How can you tell?

475
00:31:45,132 --> 00:31:47,100
- My ass.
- Sorry?

476
00:31:47,252 --> 00:31:49,141
God gave me an okay mind,

477
00:31:49,212 --> 00:31:51,943
but a really good ass,
which can feel everything in a car.

478
00:31:52,252 --> 00:31:54,493
You don't know what
you're talking about. This car is fine.

479
00:31:54,572 --> 00:31:57,303
- I just had a service a week ago.
- Not a good one.

480
00:31:57,372 --> 00:32:00,023
Yes, a very good one, very expensive.

481
00:32:00,572 --> 00:32:02,654
This car is as good as new. Relax.

482
00:32:09,972 --> 00:32:11,497
Not in a hurry, are you?

483
00:32:11,572 --> 00:32:13,256
No. As long as I'm back

484
00:32:13,332 --> 00:32:14,663
in Maranello Monday morning.

485
00:32:17,092 --> 00:32:18,332
Ja.

486
00:32:18,412 --> 00:32:20,574
- Marlene.
- Niki.

487
00:33:27,292 --> 00:33:29,863
<i>Mi scusi... Tu sei Niki Lauda?</i>

488
00:33:30,972 --> 00:33:32,940
Yes.

489
00:33:41,852 --> 00:33:43,263
- Actually, we do, yeah.
- Okay.

490
00:33:43,332 --> 00:33:44,538
It's my honour, Niki, please.

491
00:33:44,612 --> 00:33:46,853
- Thank you.
- My car is your car.

492
00:33:46,972 --> 00:33:50,693
On one condition, though.
It's a piece of shit. It's dog shit.

493
00:33:50,772 --> 00:33:53,855
But if you drive it,
you make my life, Niki, eh?

494
00:34:06,692 --> 00:34:08,820
- Niki Lauda!
- Niki Lauda, Niki Lauda!

495
00:34:10,732 --> 00:34:13,053
Will someone please tell me
what's going on?

496
00:34:13,132 --> 00:34:14,577
Who are you? Should I know you?

497
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:16,142
What, you don't know?

498
00:34:16,732 --> 00:34:20,657
He's Niki Lauda, Formula 1 driver,
and he just signed with Ferrari.

499
00:34:20,732 --> 00:34:22,222
- Him?
- Yes.

500
00:34:22,332 --> 00:34:24,539
- Impossible.
- Why?

501
00:34:24,652 --> 00:34:29,180
Well, you know, Formula 1 drivers,
they have long hair, are sexy,

502
00:34:29,212 --> 00:34:30,657
their shirts are open to here.

503
00:34:30,732 --> 00:34:32,416
- Thank you.
- Yes.

504
00:34:32,492 --> 00:34:35,894
Anyway, look at the way he's driving,
like an old man.

505
00:34:40,172 --> 00:34:41,652
There's no need to drive fast.

506
00:34:41,932 --> 00:34:43,934
It just increases
the percentage of risk.

507
00:34:44,892 --> 00:34:46,493
We're not in a hurry.
I'm not being paid.

508
00:34:47,092 --> 00:34:49,857
Right now,
with zero incentive or reward,

509
00:34:49,932 --> 00:34:51,696
why would I drive fast?

510
00:34:53,532 --> 00:34:55,534
Because I'm asking you to.

511
00:35:01,052 --> 00:35:02,383
Ja.

512
00:35:59,412 --> 00:36:01,052
<i>This is an incredible battle</i>

513
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:03,493
<i>between Niki Lauda in the red Ferrari</i>

514
00:36:03,572 --> 00:36:06,098
<i>and James Hunt in the white Hesketh.</i>

515
00:36:07,212 --> 00:36:08,702
...the challenge of Niki Lauda...

516
00:36:08,772 --> 00:36:10,262
<i>Lauda attacking Hunt.</i>

517
00:36:10,292 --> 00:36:12,101
<i>Lauda gets through on the inside.</i>

518
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:13,737
<i>Goes wide at the exit.</i>

519
00:36:13,932 --> 00:36:15,422
<i>Hunt is past again.</i>

520
00:36:15,452 --> 00:36:18,535
<i>Once more
Lauda tries to sneak up the inside.</i>

521
00:36:18,612 --> 00:36:22,617
<i>They're absolutely side by side,
wheel to wheel.</i>

522
00:36:22,692 --> 00:36:26,742
<i>So evenly matched. Fantastic battle
between these two great drivers.</i>

523
00:36:26,772 --> 00:36:29,139
<i>Hunt is now ahead once more.</i>

524
00:36:30,612 --> 00:36:35,254
<i>But Lauda's coming back again now.
Lauda once more sneaks up the inside.</i>

525
00:36:35,292 --> 00:36:37,772
<i>And again he runs wide.
Again the Hesketh...</i>

526
00:36:37,932 --> 00:36:41,095
- Suzy, we're ready, come on.
- Just... Just one second.

527
00:36:41,972 --> 00:36:44,623
- Can we go, yeah?
- Okay, yeah.

528
00:36:45,372 --> 00:36:48,137
<i>We're in the closing laps
of this race here at Watkins Glen.</i>

529
00:36:48,212 --> 00:36:49,213
<i>They come down the hill.</i>

530
00:36:50,932 --> 00:36:52,582
<i>And Hunt's got a problem!</i>

531
00:36:52,652 --> 00:36:55,098
<i>Hunt pulls across to the left.</i>

532
00:36:55,132 --> 00:36:57,976
Lauda goes ahead on his own.

533
00:36:59,652 --> 00:37:02,132
<i>A sad end to a wonderful battle.</i>

534
00:37:02,252 --> 00:37:04,823
<i>Hunt pushing off the marshal.</i>

535
00:37:13,252 --> 00:37:17,337
<i>The chequered ﬂag
is waiting for Lauda and for Ferrari.</i>

536
00:37:18,772 --> 00:37:21,457
<i>The title going to Niki Lauda,</i>

537
00:37:21,492 --> 00:37:22,937
<i>who wins the race,</i>

538
00:37:23,012 --> 00:37:25,492
<i>who wins the World Championship.</i>

539
00:38:07,332 --> 00:38:10,302
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

540
00:38:11,052 --> 00:38:12,497
Marlene.

541
00:38:14,092 --> 00:38:17,892
With a car like that, the rest of us
never really stood a chance, did we?

542
00:38:17,932 --> 00:38:20,902
Maybe the fact the car is so good
has something to do with me.

543
00:38:21,012 --> 00:38:23,902
Come on, Niki. You're in a Ferrari.
I'm in a Hesketh.

544
00:38:24,012 --> 00:38:25,901
Equal terms,
the way it was in Formula 3,

545
00:38:25,972 --> 00:38:28,418
- I'd beat you and you know it.
- Never.

546
00:38:28,532 --> 00:38:31,422
You might win one race, maybe two,
because you're aggressive.

547
00:38:31,652 --> 00:38:34,735
But in the long run, over the course
of a season, no chance.

548
00:38:34,852 --> 00:38:35,899
Right. Why's that?

549
00:38:36,172 --> 00:38:38,903
Because to be a champion,
it takes more than just being quick.

550
00:38:39,052 --> 00:38:40,736
- It's the whole picture.
- Oh.

551
00:38:40,812 --> 00:38:42,812
You're just a charger and a party guy.

552
00:38:42,852 --> 00:38:44,092
That's why everybody likes you.

553
00:38:44,692 --> 00:38:46,694
Try saying that
and tell me you're not jealous.

554
00:38:48,052 --> 00:38:50,737
Why would I be jealous? Think about it.

555
00:38:51,092 --> 00:38:53,174
All that affection, all those smiles

556
00:38:53,252 --> 00:38:55,061
- is a sign of disrespect.
- Oh.

557
00:38:55,092 --> 00:38:57,538
They don't fear you.
Whereas compare that to me.

558
00:38:57,612 --> 00:39:00,263
Yes, compared to you, whom no one likes.

559
00:39:00,372 --> 00:39:01,942
- Right.
- Not even his own teammates.

560
00:39:02,012 --> 00:39:04,777
Right. Because I'm a serious guy.

561
00:39:04,892 --> 00:39:07,293
I go to bed early,
I look after myself, look after my car.

562
00:39:07,412 --> 00:39:10,461
- Yes, you're very well-behaved.
- Go to work, kick ass.

563
00:39:10,572 --> 00:39:13,303
And then, after the race,
I go home instead of going to bars

564
00:39:13,412 --> 00:39:16,541
and talk all this bullshit
with all these assholes.

565
00:39:16,612 --> 00:39:18,455
Arseholes?

566
00:39:18,532 --> 00:39:20,978
You should go home more often, too.

567
00:39:24,292 --> 00:39:26,294
I heard you got married.

568
00:39:27,292 --> 00:39:28,896
Yes, I did.

569
00:39:30,452 --> 00:39:33,058
So where is she, this mysterious wife?

570
00:39:34,252 --> 00:39:36,254
- In New York, working.
- Oh.

571
00:39:37,652 --> 00:39:39,620
You know,
I've never seen you with her once.

572
00:39:39,652 --> 00:39:40,892
No?

573
00:39:43,252 --> 00:39:46,142
Well, maybe that's because
you're always at home,

574
00:39:46,212 --> 00:39:50,137
on your own, looking after yourself,
being a good little boy.

575
00:39:54,332 --> 00:39:55,663
Take a drink on me, James.

576
00:39:57,572 --> 00:40:00,178
Thank you, Niki. I might just have two.

577
00:40:11,532 --> 00:40:13,022
Right, Bubbles,

578
00:40:13,052 --> 00:40:16,181
whatever it takes to beat
that prick next year, just say it.

579
00:40:16,292 --> 00:40:17,703
Your word is my command.

580
00:40:17,812 --> 00:40:21,294
There are no lengths
to which I will not go. I mean it.

581
00:40:23,852 --> 00:40:25,695
What the hell's going on?

582
00:40:27,852 --> 00:40:30,458
Where is everybody? What's the matter?

583
00:40:36,052 --> 00:40:38,532
Do you know what the date is today?

584
00:40:38,612 --> 00:40:41,058
Yes, it's November, the 14th. Why?

585
00:40:41,492 --> 00:40:45,736
Do you have any idea
of the significance of that date?

586
00:40:47,052 --> 00:40:50,215
I don't know.
Time to start killing pheasants?

587
00:40:52,532 --> 00:40:55,297
Actually, it's the deadline
for securing sponsorship

588
00:40:55,372 --> 00:40:57,295
for the forthcoming Formula 1 season.

589
00:40:57,532 --> 00:40:58,977
Yes?

590
00:40:59,172 --> 00:41:02,142
Which elapsed at midnight last night,
and we didn't attract any.

591
00:41:02,532 --> 00:41:06,093
Well, so?
We aren't looking for sponsorship.

592
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:08,459
Like you said, condoms and cigarettes,
vulgar, right?

593
00:41:10,412 --> 00:41:11,618
Right.

594
00:41:13,172 --> 00:41:15,539
Except we are, or were.

595
00:41:18,332 --> 00:41:20,778
I've made something of a miscalculation.

596
00:41:21,732 --> 00:41:25,214
The economics, Formula 1,
realities thereof.

597
00:41:26,612 --> 00:41:29,775
It turns out,
not like the lower divisions at all.

598
00:41:32,292 --> 00:41:34,021
What are you saying?

599
00:41:35,932 --> 00:41:38,412
I'm saying it's over, Superstar.

600
00:41:39,252 --> 00:41:42,779
The banks have stepped in,
started laying everyone off.

601
00:41:44,572 --> 00:41:46,973
Probably have to sell this place.

602
00:41:47,572 --> 00:41:49,574
Oh, Christ.

603
00:42:30,212 --> 00:42:33,978
I need a drive, Pete.
I need you to find me a drive.

604
00:42:34,412 --> 00:42:35,937
I mean, what about Lotus?

605
00:42:37,052 --> 00:42:38,497
You don't wanna know.

606
00:42:38,732 --> 00:42:41,463
<i>- Actually, I do.
- Okay. Uh...</i>

607
00:42:43,812 --> 00:42:45,814
They felt your reputation preceded you.

608
00:42:46,132 --> 00:42:47,816
And what does that mean?

609
00:42:49,452 --> 00:42:52,501
It's my other line.
Look, I'll get back to you.

610
00:42:54,412 --> 00:42:55,493
Peter Hunt.

611
00:42:55,852 --> 00:42:57,422
Fuck.

612
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:09,697
Don't worry. Something will turn up.

613
00:43:18,492 --> 00:43:20,540
Doubt that will help in the meantime.

614
00:43:23,492 --> 00:43:26,143
Why don't we go away at the weekend?

615
00:43:26,212 --> 00:43:29,341
Skiing. Before I go back to New York.

616
00:43:32,972 --> 00:43:36,374
Talk to me, James.
Don't make a stranger of me.

617
00:43:36,492 --> 00:43:40,497
You know, Suzy,
only a stranger would invite me skiing

618
00:43:40,532 --> 00:43:42,978
when they know
I haven't got a fucking drive.

619
00:43:49,372 --> 00:43:51,136
I can't watch this.

620
00:43:51,892 --> 00:43:54,213
What were you hoping for anyway?

621
00:43:54,692 --> 00:43:56,979
A well-adjusted knight
in shining armour?

622
00:43:57,052 --> 00:43:58,975
No danger of that.

623
00:43:59,052 --> 00:44:01,339
- Let me give you some advice.
- I'm all ears.

624
00:44:01,412 --> 00:44:04,177
Don't go to men who are willing
to kill themselves driving in circles

625
00:44:04,252 --> 00:44:06,903
- looking for normality.
- I never expected normality.

626
00:44:07,012 --> 00:44:09,094
God knows I walked into this
with my eyes open.

627
00:44:09,172 --> 00:44:10,662
I just hoped I'd married someone

628
00:44:10,732 --> 00:44:13,815
who was half as impressive
on the inside as he is on the outside.

629
00:44:13,932 --> 00:44:15,696
At least there's something
behind the facade.

630
00:44:15,732 --> 00:44:17,939
- Oh, James.
- Fuck off to New York, dear.

631
00:44:19,092 --> 00:44:21,413
There must be a moisturiser
or an eye shadow somewhere

632
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,256
that needs your vapid mush to flog it.

633
00:44:59,972 --> 00:45:01,417
<i>- Hello?
- Hi, James.</i>

634
00:45:01,452 --> 00:45:04,774
It's Peter. Something's up at McLaren.

635
00:45:05,372 --> 00:45:07,374
<i>- What have you heard?
- Nothing. Why?</i>

636
00:45:07,452 --> 00:45:09,978
I heard Emerson's off.
He's dumped them in it.

637
00:45:10,652 --> 00:45:12,734
Jesus. Get me in there, Pete.

638
00:45:12,812 --> 00:45:15,213
Say anything, just get me in that room.

639
00:45:20,132 --> 00:45:21,896
I'll come straight to the point.

640
00:45:21,972 --> 00:45:25,419
- Our esteemed lead driver...
- Fitti-fucking-paldi.

641
00:45:25,492 --> 00:45:27,733
...has ditched us for another team
at the last minute.

642
00:45:27,812 --> 00:45:30,133
- Coper-fucking-sucar.
- And we need a replacement.

643
00:45:30,172 --> 00:45:31,662
ASA-fucking-P.

644
00:45:32,652 --> 00:45:36,498
Fortunately, a few hands
have already gone up, good people.

645
00:45:37,332 --> 00:45:40,017
- Jacky Ickx.
- I'm quicker than Jacky.

646
00:45:40,452 --> 00:45:44,343
- But he's consistent, dependable.
- A grown-up.

647
00:45:44,412 --> 00:45:47,859
Right, and will he go for that gap
when no one else will?

648
00:45:47,972 --> 00:45:49,940
Will he put his life on the line
the day that it really matters?

649
00:45:50,252 --> 00:45:51,697
The sponsors like him.

650
00:45:52,172 --> 00:45:54,373
What do you want,
a driver or a brush salesman?

651
00:45:54,412 --> 00:45:56,332
- We wanna be successful.
- Yes, so do I.

652
00:45:56,612 --> 00:45:59,536
But that means beating Niki Lauda,
not being a show pony for sponsors.

653
00:45:59,612 --> 00:46:01,137
I heard about this thing with Niki.

654
00:46:01,172 --> 00:46:02,378
Everyone has.

655
00:46:03,652 --> 00:46:06,019
- You really think you can beat him?
- I'd beat him in a McLaren.

656
00:46:06,092 --> 00:46:09,380
It's the only car out there
as quick as the Ferrari.

657
00:46:09,692 --> 00:46:11,694
Which is why I'm here, begging.

658
00:46:12,172 --> 00:46:13,617
Look, I'll do whatever you ask.

659
00:46:13,692 --> 00:46:15,535
I'll put on a tie,
I'll smile for sponsors,

660
00:46:15,652 --> 00:46:17,541
say the right things.

661
00:46:17,852 --> 00:46:20,173
I can beat this guy, trust me.

662
00:46:21,012 --> 00:46:22,901
Just give me the drive.

663
00:46:23,612 --> 00:46:25,501
<i>Yeah.
Yeah, he can be a loose cannon.</i>

664
00:46:25,692 --> 00:46:27,296
And, yeah, he will drive you all mad,

665
00:46:27,372 --> 00:46:30,899
but in terms of raw talent
and right stuff,

666
00:46:31,012 --> 00:46:32,901
there is no better driver in the world.

667
00:46:33,292 --> 00:46:35,454
<i>He's the real thing, Teddy.</i>

668
00:46:35,572 --> 00:46:38,052
<i>- He's what we all came into this for.
- Mmm.</i>

669
00:46:38,172 --> 00:46:40,174
Nine days out of ten
you'll be pulling your hair out,

670
00:46:40,212 --> 00:46:43,375
but on that tenth day,
James will be unbeatable.

671
00:46:43,412 --> 00:46:45,414
And that is the day you will wish
you had him in your car.

672
00:46:45,692 --> 00:46:48,536
<i>You will never win the championship
with Jacky Ickx.</i>

673
00:46:48,892 --> 00:46:51,259
You just might with James.

674
00:47:13,412 --> 00:47:15,779
Welcome to Sao Paulo, Brazil,
and the Interlagos circuit

675
00:47:15,892 --> 00:47:19,533
for the first race
in the 1976 Formula 1 season,

676
00:47:19,772 --> 00:47:22,935
where the main news is that James Hunt
has qualified fastest,

677
00:47:23,012 --> 00:47:25,094
beating Niki Lauda's Ferrari
to pole position

678
00:47:25,212 --> 00:47:27,943
by just two hundredths of a second.

679
00:47:28,932 --> 00:47:30,536
New car.

680
00:47:31,372 --> 00:47:33,022
- I noticed.
- Pole position.

681
00:47:34,052 --> 00:47:35,383
I noticed that, too.

682
00:47:35,452 --> 00:47:37,898
Level playing field now,
my ratty little friend.

683
00:47:37,932 --> 00:47:41,539
Yeah. Let's see where we are
after lap one.

684
00:47:41,612 --> 00:47:44,422
Let's see where we are
in five races' time.

685
00:47:45,252 --> 00:47:47,380
Hunt has the pit lane pole position,

686
00:47:47,452 --> 00:47:50,262
which should give him the best chance
of outdragging Lauda's Ferrari.

687
00:47:51,292 --> 00:47:52,896
If ever there was a doubt about

688
00:47:52,972 --> 00:47:56,260
whether Lauda had
a serious challenger to this season,

689
00:47:56,292 --> 00:47:59,933
Hunt and his McLaren
have certainly given us the answer.

690
00:48:15,612 --> 00:48:17,137
<i>Here in South Africa,</i>

691
00:48:17,172 --> 00:48:19,174
<i>James Hunt is determined to make amends</i>

692
00:48:19,292 --> 00:48:22,296
<i>after that disastrous retirement
in Brazil.</i>

693
00:48:23,292 --> 00:48:26,774
<i>But it's Lauda who takes the ﬂag
here at Kyalami.</i>

694
00:48:26,852 --> 00:48:28,502
<i>James Hunt comes home second</i>

695
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:31,018
<i>to confirm his championship
challenge at last</i>

696
00:48:31,092 --> 00:48:32,821
<i>and score his first points</i>

697
00:48:32,852 --> 00:48:34,422
<i>of the season.</i>

698
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:38,858
That wind you can feel
is me breathing down your neck.

699
00:48:38,972 --> 00:48:40,974
Next time I'll have you.

700
00:48:41,932 --> 00:48:43,343
We'll see in Spain.

701
00:49:03,852 --> 00:49:07,652
<i>James Hunt finally takes
his first victory of the season</i>

702
00:49:07,692 --> 00:49:10,218
<i>here in Spain, after a brilliant drive.</i>

703
00:49:10,332 --> 00:49:12,539
It was only a matter of time.

704
00:49:19,732 --> 00:49:22,702
Luca, don't you think it's time
to tell them?

705
00:49:29,412 --> 00:49:31,733
- It's too wide.
- Disqualified.

706
00:49:32,132 --> 00:49:34,499
- What?
- You're disqualified.

707
00:49:34,572 --> 00:49:36,256
How can we be disqualified?

708
00:49:36,372 --> 00:49:38,181
- 1.5 centimetres.
- It's the same car.

709
00:49:38,252 --> 00:49:40,414
<i>Giustissimo.</i>

710
00:49:44,572 --> 00:49:45,733
You fucking...

711
00:49:45,852 --> 00:49:48,696
<i>...McLaren M23
has proved very controversial here.</i>

712
00:49:50,732 --> 00:49:52,575
Just make it narrower. I don't care how.

713
00:49:52,692 --> 00:49:54,740
New rear suspension.
New wishbones.

714
00:49:54,772 --> 00:49:57,582
I wanna make sure
this thing is legal, no doubts.

715
00:49:57,692 --> 00:50:00,093
Well, then we'd better move the
oil coolers back to the old position.

716
00:50:00,172 --> 00:50:02,379
With the oil coolers back, the
wing brackets need to be changed, too.

717
00:50:02,412 --> 00:50:03,538
Fuck.

718
00:50:03,612 --> 00:50:05,740
What the fuck
d'you think we're doing?

719
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:17,892
<i>And with Hunt disqualified
from his Spain win,</i>

720
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:20,538
<i>his championship year is not going well.</i>

721
00:50:20,612 --> 00:50:23,138
<i>And now it's all gone wrong
here at Monaco!</i>

722
00:50:23,252 --> 00:50:25,380
<i>His engine is smoking.</i>

723
00:50:27,572 --> 00:50:30,143
Smoke pouring
from the engine of that McLaren!

724
00:50:30,252 --> 00:50:31,697
And James Hunt is out!

725
00:50:31,772 --> 00:50:34,252
- Can you tell us what happened?
- Sure. It's magic.

726
00:50:34,292 --> 00:50:36,454
We've taken a great car,
a great piece of engineering,

727
00:50:36,532 --> 00:50:39,741
and overnight turned it into
a big, huge, stinking turd.

728
00:50:51,652 --> 00:50:53,063
Shit!

729
00:50:56,492 --> 00:50:58,779
What the hell have you done?
The car's evil.

730
00:50:58,812 --> 00:51:00,496
It's fucking undriveable!

731
00:51:00,572 --> 00:51:02,461
James, look, if there's a problem
with the car we'll find it...

732
00:51:02,492 --> 00:51:04,494
The car is a piece of shit.
You should be appealing this.

733
00:51:04,572 --> 00:51:06,620
- We are appealing it.
- We will sort it out.

734
00:51:06,732 --> 00:51:08,780
- They're killing us out there.
- Go and get your dick wet.

735
00:51:08,812 --> 00:51:10,621
- You're a wanker.
- Fuck you.

736
00:51:10,652 --> 00:51:12,461
<i>- You're a fucking wanker.
- I will, arsehole.</i>

737
00:51:13,732 --> 00:51:15,336
But this was a good race for you,
no, Niki?

738
00:51:15,412 --> 00:51:16,493
It's good for everyone

739
00:51:16,612 --> 00:51:18,501
that the quickest car
happens to be a legal car.

740
00:51:18,612 --> 00:51:21,343
James, you're 50 points
behind Lauda in the championship.

741
00:51:21,452 --> 00:51:24,899
You've had another retirement today.
What's going wrong?

742
00:51:25,012 --> 00:51:26,980
Oh, it's dirty politics
and dirty tricks,

743
00:51:27,012 --> 00:51:28,423
that's what's going wrong.

744
00:51:28,652 --> 00:51:31,019
<i>So, as we approach
the halfway point</i>

745
00:51:31,092 --> 00:51:32,856
<i>in this year's Formula 1 season,</i>

746
00:51:33,372 --> 00:51:36,615
<i>Ferrari and Niki Lauda
seem clearly on top,</i>

747
00:51:36,692 --> 00:51:39,741
<i>and James Hunt and McLaren
are struggling.</i>

748
00:51:39,852 --> 00:51:43,299
So, five races in,
how's it going so far?

749
00:51:43,692 --> 00:51:46,935
It's fine. Just got a little problem
with an Austrian rat

750
00:51:47,052 --> 00:51:48,622
and his team of Italian cheats

751
00:51:48,692 --> 00:51:51,172
- who have destroyed my car.
- What are you talking about?

752
00:51:51,212 --> 00:51:53,374
I'm talking about the race in Spain
that I won.

753
00:51:53,492 --> 00:51:56,701
- Yeah, in a car which is not legal.
- Five-eighths of an inch too wide.

754
00:51:56,812 --> 00:51:59,053
You know that doesn't have
the slightest effect on speed.

755
00:51:59,172 --> 00:52:01,539
But you complained and your team
of lawyers leaned on the authorities.

756
00:52:01,692 --> 00:52:04,821
Now we've had to rebuild the car,
and it's become a monster.

757
00:52:04,892 --> 00:52:07,862
- At least it's a legal monster.
- You've had to resort to cheating.

758
00:52:08,172 --> 00:52:11,733
You're driving an illegal car
and call me the cheat? It's pathetic.

759
00:52:11,852 --> 00:52:15,061
- Rules are rules.
- Yes, and rats are rats.

760
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:16,213
Thank you. Thank you.

761
00:52:19,532 --> 00:52:22,217
Do you really think it upsets me, James,

762
00:52:22,252 --> 00:52:25,222
calling me a rat
because I look like one?

763
00:52:25,252 --> 00:52:26,981
I don't mind it.

764
00:52:27,092 --> 00:52:28,901
Rats are ugly, sure,
and nobody likes them,

765
00:52:28,972 --> 00:52:32,693
but they're very intelligent and
they have a strong survival instinct.

766
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:34,416
<i>- Wonderful.
- Marlene, komm.</i>

767
00:52:36,092 --> 00:52:37,537
No wonder she left him.

768
00:52:55,412 --> 00:52:56,902
Anyone seen Suzy?

769
00:52:58,572 --> 00:53:01,018
She's supposed to be here today.

770
00:53:01,092 --> 00:53:04,255
We, er... didn't wanna tell you
before the race.

771
00:53:05,212 --> 00:53:06,782
Tell me what?

772
00:53:12,132 --> 00:53:13,577
Jesus.

773
00:53:38,292 --> 00:53:39,817
Is that from him?

774
00:53:40,412 --> 00:53:41,823
Yeah.

775
00:53:48,332 --> 00:53:50,494
So when did all this start?

776
00:53:51,732 --> 00:53:54,019
That weekend I went skiing.

777
00:53:56,812 --> 00:53:59,099
Why have you come here, James?

778
00:53:59,652 --> 00:54:01,097
I've come to get you back.

779
00:54:02,292 --> 00:54:04,181
You don't want me back.

780
00:54:04,292 --> 00:54:05,942
You never wanted to be married
in the first place.

781
00:54:06,012 --> 00:54:08,333
- Yes, I did.
- Oh, come on, James.

782
00:54:08,932 --> 00:54:11,412
You did it because
you hoped it might change you,

783
00:54:11,492 --> 00:54:13,176
settle you down, help with the racing.

784
00:54:13,532 --> 00:54:14,943
No, I didn't.

785
00:54:15,132 --> 00:54:17,294
And who knows?
If it had been just the drinking

786
00:54:17,332 --> 00:54:21,132
or the dope or the infidelity
or the moods,

787
00:54:21,172 --> 00:54:22,333
it might even have worked.

788
00:54:23,132 --> 00:54:24,941
- But when it's all of them...
- Yes, I know, I'm terrible.

789
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:26,855
No, you're not terrible.

790
00:54:27,852 --> 00:54:31,015
You're just who you are
at this point in your life.

791
00:54:33,332 --> 00:54:35,016
God help anyone who wants more.

792
00:54:37,652 --> 00:54:40,895
And Richard Burton,
will he able to give you more?

793
00:54:42,372 --> 00:54:44,818
You know, he has quite
the bad boy reputation himself.

794
00:54:45,892 --> 00:54:48,543
What's important is how it feels to me,

795
00:54:48,692 --> 00:54:50,979
and it feels like he adores me.

796
00:54:57,492 --> 00:54:58,903
- James!
- New York Times!

797
00:54:58,972 --> 00:55:00,417
Are you and Suzy getting back together?

798
00:55:00,492 --> 00:55:03,416
<i>- James, how do you feel...
- It's all very amicable.</i>

799
00:55:03,492 --> 00:55:06,018
My wife has found herself
a new backer...

800
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:08,578
I mean, lover, which makes her happy.

801
00:55:08,652 --> 00:55:11,223
And Mr Burton has found
a way of feeling young again,

802
00:55:11,252 --> 00:55:12,697
which makes him happy.

803
00:55:12,732 --> 00:55:15,053
Let's hope his pockets are deep.
They'll need to be.

804
00:55:15,092 --> 00:55:18,335
And I've found a way to be single
and have an ex-wife

805
00:55:18,412 --> 00:55:20,096
without it costing me a penny,

806
00:55:20,172 --> 00:55:22,334
which has got to go down
as the biggest win of my career.

807
00:55:22,412 --> 00:55:25,143
I have a flight to catch.

808
00:56:52,932 --> 00:56:55,503
<i>We haven't seen
this sort of intensity</i>

809
00:56:55,532 --> 00:56:57,182
<i>from James Hunt all season long.</i>

810
00:56:57,212 --> 00:57:00,182
Reports have been coming out
of the McLaren camp all week

811
00:57:00,212 --> 00:57:03,694
that their car is now fully legal
and faster than ever.

812
00:57:13,452 --> 00:57:15,580
Never mind the bloody wets.
We're still quick.

813
00:57:19,692 --> 00:57:23,094
Hunt has really closed the gap on Lauda
as they head into Druids.

814
00:57:25,252 --> 00:57:28,062
<i>Niki Lauda is under real pressure
from James Hunt</i>

815
00:57:28,092 --> 00:57:30,743
<i>as they go up the hill
into Druids Corner.</i>

816
00:57:36,572 --> 00:57:38,415
And Hunt is in front of Lauda!

817
00:57:45,932 --> 00:57:47,297
<i>So James Hunt gets the plaudits</i>

818
00:57:47,412 --> 00:57:49,221
<i>of the crowd, the first Briton to win</i>

819
00:57:49,292 --> 00:57:50,942
<i>a British Grand Prix at Brands Hatch</i>

820
00:57:51,052 --> 00:57:52,941
<i>since Jim Clark in 1964.</i>

821
00:57:56,612 --> 00:57:58,580
James, at the moment
you've got a terrific edge

822
00:57:58,612 --> 00:58:01,582
over the rest of the field.
How have you achieved this advantage?

823
00:58:01,972 --> 00:58:03,576
Big balls.

824
00:58:03,652 --> 00:58:05,142
Would you...

825
00:58:05,292 --> 00:58:08,262
<i>Following an inquiry
into the disqualification</i>

826
00:58:08,332 --> 00:58:10,733
<i>of driver James Hunt
from the Spanish Grand Prix,</i>

827
00:58:10,852 --> 00:58:12,263
<i>it has been decided</i>

828
00:58:12,332 --> 00:58:14,255
<i>- to overturn this disqualification...
- Yes!</i>

829
00:58:14,332 --> 00:58:17,779
<i>...and to restore his victory
and reinstate his points.</i>

830
00:58:23,972 --> 00:58:25,417
James! James!

831
00:58:25,492 --> 00:58:27,301
James, a few weeks ago
you were out of the running

832
00:58:27,452 --> 00:58:29,261
for the season completely,
and now you're right back in it.

833
00:58:29,332 --> 00:58:32,256
- What's changed?
- Well, it's a combination of factors -

834
00:58:32,332 --> 00:58:34,460
not all of which I'm prepared
to discuss here -

835
00:58:34,492 --> 00:58:38,816
but justice being done
re the disqualification in Spain helps,

836
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:41,378
and having my car
back at its best again.

837
00:58:58,332 --> 00:58:59,982
<i>James! James!</i>

838
01:01:29,492 --> 01:01:31,699
Welcome to the legendary Nurburgring.

839
01:01:32,452 --> 01:01:34,295
This is a 14.2-mile track,

840
01:01:34,772 --> 01:01:38,140
complete with 185 corners and bends.

841
01:02:37,092 --> 01:02:38,935
<i>Welcome to the Nurburgring,</i>

842
01:02:39,012 --> 01:02:41,618
<i>the most dangerous circuit
on the season calendar.</i>

843
01:02:41,932 --> 01:02:44,742
In Formula 1 it is known
as the Graveyard.

844
01:02:44,852 --> 01:02:46,581
The weather conditions
are far from ideal,

845
01:02:46,692 --> 01:02:48,262
and latest reports indicate

846
01:02:48,372 --> 01:02:50,022
there is no relief in sight.

847
01:02:54,852 --> 01:02:59,858
Gentlemen. Well, gentlemen,
please be quiet.

848
01:02:59,932 --> 01:03:02,094
Thank you. Niki Lauda.

849
01:03:02,292 --> 01:03:03,817
Thank you.

850
01:03:04,692 --> 01:03:07,935
I called this meeting because,
as all you drivers know,

851
01:03:08,052 --> 01:03:10,214
the Nurburgring is the most stupid,
barbaric, outdated

852
01:03:10,252 --> 01:03:11,742
and dangerous track in the world.

853
01:03:11,772 --> 01:03:14,059
You've all seen the rain
that has been falling today.

854
01:03:14,092 --> 01:03:17,733
Now, those of you with experience know
the ring needs perfect conditions

855
01:03:17,812 --> 01:03:20,463
to be even remotely acceptable
in terms of risk.

856
01:03:20,572 --> 01:03:22,939
And today, with the rain,
it's anything but perfect,

857
01:03:23,052 --> 01:03:26,135
so I called this meeting to
take a vote to cancel the race.

858
01:03:26,212 --> 01:03:28,294
Cancel the race?

859
01:03:28,412 --> 01:03:30,414
There would be no change
to the situation

860
01:03:30,452 --> 01:03:31,897
as far as points is concerned.

861
01:03:31,932 --> 01:03:34,583
- The race would simply be cancelled.
- This is bullshit.

862
01:03:34,652 --> 01:03:36,893
If the race is cancelled,
none of us get our race fees.

863
01:03:36,972 --> 01:03:41,341
That's true, you leave without your fee,
but you might leave with your life.

864
01:03:41,412 --> 01:03:45,656
It also means that you would
effectively win the championship.

865
01:03:46,092 --> 01:03:48,618
So, I can see why
this suits you just fine.

866
01:03:49,012 --> 01:03:51,583
Why? There would be
no points for me either.

867
01:03:51,932 --> 01:03:54,253
No, but there would be one race less

868
01:03:54,292 --> 01:03:56,659
where I, or anyone else here,
could catch you.

869
01:03:56,732 --> 01:03:59,019
James is right. This is just tactics.

870
01:03:59,092 --> 01:04:01,777
Maybe he's just frightened.

871
01:04:03,292 --> 01:04:04,817
Which asshole said this?

872
01:04:10,612 --> 01:04:13,661
Yes, of course I'm frightened,
and so are you.

873
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:19,538
I accept, every time I get in my car,
there is 20 per cent chance I could die,

874
01:04:19,612 --> 01:04:21,182
and I can live with it,

875
01:04:21,292 --> 01:04:23,294
but not one per cent more.

876
01:04:23,332 --> 01:04:25,653
And today, with the rain,
the risk is more.

877
01:04:25,772 --> 01:04:28,503
I suppose that all depends
on how good you are in the rain.

878
01:04:28,972 --> 01:04:30,815
I have the track record here.

879
01:04:30,852 --> 01:04:33,742
I am the only person in history
to do the ring in under seven minutes.

880
01:04:33,812 --> 01:04:36,497
So, actually, it's to my advantage
to race here today.

881
01:04:38,132 --> 01:04:40,533
Because I'm quicker than all of you.

882
01:04:41,572 --> 01:04:44,860
- Come on.
- Fine. Then let's race.

883
01:04:46,492 --> 01:04:48,859
<i>- Come on, Niki, let's race.
- Gentlemen, please.</i>

884
01:04:48,972 --> 01:04:50,656
Why are we here, Niki? Come on.

885
01:04:56,892 --> 01:04:59,543
Well, all those in favour
of cancelling the race.

886
01:05:09,732 --> 01:05:11,496
All those in favour of racing.

887
01:05:17,892 --> 01:05:19,337
Gentlemen, the race is on.

888
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:28,333
- Ridiculous.
-  What a waste of time.

889
01:05:29,732 --> 01:05:32,576
You know, Niki, every now and then
it helps if people like you.

890
01:05:48,932 --> 01:05:51,060
In places
the track is still dangerously wet,

891
01:05:51,092 --> 01:05:52,537
but following a drivers' meeting,

892
01:05:52,612 --> 01:05:54,137
a decision has finally been taken.

893
01:05:55,452 --> 01:05:57,136
The race is going ahead.

894
01:06:01,372 --> 01:06:02,578
Niki!

895
01:06:02,612 --> 01:06:04,376
<i>One minute to go.</i>

896
01:06:13,892 --> 01:06:17,055
Jochen's going on slicks.
You wanna change?

897
01:06:17,092 --> 01:06:19,572
<i>- Is Niki gonna change?
- No.</i>

898
01:06:19,652 --> 01:06:21,734
Then we stay on wets, too.

899
01:06:29,572 --> 01:06:31,336
- Niki, okay?
- I'm good.

900
01:06:33,812 --> 01:06:36,292
All right, fire her up.

901
01:06:49,652 --> 01:06:52,258
<i>This season's fight for
the Formula 1 World Championship</i>

902
01:06:52,292 --> 01:06:55,933
<i>has so far been the story of two men.</i>

903
01:06:55,972 --> 01:06:59,613
<i>Thus far, it's been going
pretty much the way of Niki Lauda.</i>

904
01:06:59,652 --> 01:07:02,337
<i>But James Hunt
has qualified fastest here.</i>

905
01:07:02,452 --> 01:07:05,456
<i>He is on pole position
for the German Grand Prix,</i>

906
01:07:05,532 --> 01:07:08,615
<i>with Niki Lauda alongside
in the blood-red Ferrari.</i>

907
01:07:10,052 --> 01:07:11,463
<i>It's a long race.</i>

908
01:07:11,532 --> 01:07:14,183
If the track starts to dry out,

909
01:07:14,292 --> 01:07:17,136
the wet-weather tyres
will no longer be as quick.

910
01:07:38,572 --> 01:07:40,574
Niki Lauda
and James Hunt, side by side

911
01:07:40,652 --> 01:07:43,815
on the front row of the grid,
go away absolutely as one.

912
01:07:58,012 --> 01:08:00,219
<i>Lauda very aggressive on Hunt there,</i>

913
01:08:00,332 --> 01:08:02,334
<i>forcing the McLaren onto the grass.</i>

914
01:08:06,692 --> 01:08:08,103
<i>Lauda has the lead at the moment.</i>

915
01:08:08,172 --> 01:08:10,539
Lauda leads into the first corner.

916
01:08:10,732 --> 01:08:12,700
<i>Hunt is in second place.</i>

917
01:08:17,372 --> 01:08:19,943
<i>Mass storming past Hunt!</i>

918
01:08:20,012 --> 01:08:22,697
<i>He made the right choice
to go with the dry-weather tyres.</i>

919
01:08:24,212 --> 01:08:26,021
<i>Mass passing Lauda now!</i>

920
01:08:26,132 --> 01:08:30,057
<i>Jochen Mass, in the number 12 McLaren,
takes the lead!</i>

921
01:08:30,212 --> 01:08:31,896
Jochen Mass the clear leader,

922
01:08:32,052 --> 01:08:34,100
with everybody else making the decision

923
01:08:34,212 --> 01:08:36,294
to change tyres
after just one lap of this race.

924
01:08:36,372 --> 01:08:38,579
He's coming in! Come on, let's go!

925
01:08:46,732 --> 01:08:50,782
See? I told you to go on slicks.
You should have taken my advice.

926
01:08:50,892 --> 01:08:52,656
Fuck off. Where's Niki?

927
01:08:52,732 --> 01:08:55,417
Behind you.
He made the same mistake.

928
01:09:08,172 --> 01:09:09,901
Come on!

929
01:09:12,452 --> 01:09:14,261
Come on! What's going on?

930
01:09:15,772 --> 01:09:19,094
The tyre-changing frenzy has caused
a huge reshuffling of the pack,

931
01:09:19,132 --> 01:09:22,102
- with Jochen Mass in the lead now.
- You're clear. Go!

932
01:09:22,652 --> 01:09:23,778
Quick!

933
01:09:25,252 --> 01:09:27,016
Lauda urging his mechanics to hurry.

934
01:09:27,092 --> 01:09:28,253
Quicker, quicker, quicker!

935
01:09:30,012 --> 01:09:32,094
It's a disaster! Come on!

936
01:09:43,652 --> 01:09:45,222
What's going on, you assholes?

937
01:10:08,972 --> 01:10:11,134
This race has gone wrong for him so far.

938
01:10:11,212 --> 01:10:14,659
<i>His championship rival, James Hunt,
is a long way up the road.</i>

939
01:10:25,532 --> 01:10:26,977
<i>Lauda passing car after car.</i>

940
01:10:27,012 --> 01:10:30,494
<i>He's just going past
Mario Andretti's Lotus there.</i>

941
01:11:17,212 --> 01:11:19,214
Niki!

942
01:11:24,212 --> 01:11:26,294
Get me out! Help me!

943
01:11:26,892 --> 01:11:29,452
<i>We have an accident
on the course. Red flags are out.</i>

944
01:11:29,732 --> 01:11:33,532
<i>Several cars are involved. Looks like
it might be one of the Ferraris.</i>

945
01:11:40,732 --> 01:11:43,099
<i>- Come this way.
- Come on, come on!</i>

946
01:11:55,332 --> 01:11:56,743
<i>Keep trying.</i>

947
01:12:04,412 --> 01:12:06,052
<i>- Come this way.
- Okay.</i>

948
01:13:44,332 --> 01:13:47,779
<i>The ﬂood, which swept
down Big Thompson Canyon in Colorado,</i>

949
01:13:47,852 --> 01:13:49,536
<i>was the worst since records began.</i>

950
01:13:49,572 --> 01:13:52,098
<i>In Formula 1 today,
victory celebrations were muted</i>

951
01:13:52,172 --> 01:13:55,938
<i>after a horrific accident involving
world champion Niki Lauda.</i>

952
01:13:56,012 --> 01:13:57,935
<i>Due to safety concerns before the race,</i>

953
01:13:58,012 --> 01:14:00,379
<i>the Austrian had said
he would not take part,</i>

954
01:14:00,412 --> 01:14:01,902
<i>but in the end he did.</i>

955
01:14:03,292 --> 01:14:05,579
<i>He was making up for lost time
when he went off the track,</i>

956
01:14:05,692 --> 01:14:08,059
<i>puncturing the Ferrari's fuel tank.</i>

957
01:14:08,452 --> 01:14:10,739
<i>Brett Lunger was unable to
avoid the flaming wreck,</i>

958
01:14:10,892 --> 01:14:13,816
<i>but was unhurt and joined with
the other drivers to rescue Lauda,</i>

959
01:14:13,892 --> 01:14:16,782
<i>who was taken to Mannheim Hospital
with severe burns,</i>

960
01:14:16,892 --> 01:14:20,533
<i>the incident reminding us again
of the dangers of Formula 1.</i>

961
01:14:20,652 --> 01:14:22,654
<i>Niki Lauda was trapped
for almost a minute</i>

962
01:14:22,732 --> 01:14:25,383
<i>in a searing inferno
of 800-plus degrees.</i>

963
01:14:34,212 --> 01:14:36,419
- Do we have any change this morning?
- No...

964
01:14:36,492 --> 01:14:38,415
Frau Lauda. Frau Lauda?

965
01:19:12,172 --> 01:19:14,061
- Morning, chaps.
- Hey, here's the man.

966
01:19:14,252 --> 01:19:15,902
Looking good.

967
01:19:19,132 --> 01:19:21,942
- What's going on?
- Jesus. It's Niki.

968
01:19:22,012 --> 01:19:24,060
- What about him?
- He's here.

969
01:19:24,372 --> 01:19:25,897
- What?
- He's racing.

970
01:19:41,252 --> 01:19:42,902
Niki.

971
01:19:49,532 --> 01:19:51,057
It's that bad, huh?

972
01:19:52,372 --> 01:19:53,783
No.

973
01:19:54,652 --> 01:19:57,576
In hospital I asked them straight,
no bullshit,

974
01:19:57,652 --> 01:19:59,495
how bad my appearance would be.

975
01:20:00,732 --> 01:20:03,099
They said with time it would be fine.

976
01:20:03,972 --> 01:20:05,576
But it won't.

977
01:20:06,492 --> 01:20:09,336
I can tell, seeing your reaction.

978
01:20:10,292 --> 01:20:13,296
I will spend the rest of my life
with a face that frightens people.

979
01:20:17,412 --> 01:20:21,178
You know, Niki, I tried to write you
a letter at the time, to apologise.

980
01:20:22,812 --> 01:20:25,292
The drivers' meeting in Germany,
before the race.

981
01:20:25,412 --> 01:20:27,938
- I swayed the room.
- Yes, you did.

982
01:20:28,132 --> 01:20:30,339
That race should never have gone ahead.

983
01:20:31,092 --> 01:20:32,696
No, it shouldn't.

984
01:20:33,132 --> 01:20:36,773
So, in many ways, I feel responsible
for what happened, and...

985
01:20:36,852 --> 01:20:38,422
You were.

986
01:20:40,092 --> 01:20:41,821
But, trust me...

987
01:20:42,972 --> 01:20:47,022
watching you win those races
while I was fighting for my life...

988
01:20:49,332 --> 01:20:52,541
...you were equally responsible
for getting me back in the car.

989
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:22,977
- How are you feeling, Niki?
- Fine.

990
01:21:23,372 --> 01:21:26,979
Niki, can you confirm to us exactly
which procedures you've had

991
01:21:27,012 --> 01:21:29,014
and the expectations for your recovery?

992
01:21:29,572 --> 01:21:31,017
Sure.

993
01:21:31,172 --> 01:21:32,981
I had a skin graft operation,

994
01:21:33,012 --> 01:21:35,333
where they put half my right thigh
in my face.

995
01:21:37,532 --> 01:21:42,333
Now, it doesn't look too good,
but one unexpected advantage is

996
01:21:42,372 --> 01:21:44,659
it's impossible to perspire
through a skin graft,

997
01:21:44,732 --> 01:21:48,100
so sweat will never run into my eyes
again, which is good for a driver.

998
01:21:50,372 --> 01:21:52,022
When they heard about your condition,

999
01:21:52,052 --> 01:21:55,499
Ferrari immediately hired
a replacement driver, Carlos Reutemann.

1000
01:21:56,172 --> 01:22:00,177
Yeah, before even reaching the hospital.

1001
01:22:00,212 --> 01:22:02,260
Is Reutemann driving today, too?

1002
01:22:02,692 --> 01:22:05,696
Yes, and keen to make an impression.

1003
01:22:05,892 --> 01:22:09,863
So, let's see where Mr Reutemann
finishes and where I finish today.

1004
01:22:11,412 --> 01:22:14,097
James Hunt and McLaren have
caught up a lot while you were away.

1005
01:22:14,732 --> 01:22:16,222
Yes.

1006
01:22:16,852 --> 01:22:19,776
So is there a question now,
or are you just trying to piss me off?

1007
01:22:23,132 --> 01:22:24,861
You still think you can win?

1008
01:22:25,292 --> 01:22:27,056
Yes, of course.

1009
01:22:27,092 --> 01:22:29,094
I have the better car.

1010
01:22:29,212 --> 01:22:31,692
And possibly I'm the better driver.

1011
01:22:31,892 --> 01:22:34,293
But he's a clever guy,
and he's used his time well

1012
01:22:34,372 --> 01:22:38,422
while I was lying half-dead in hospital
to win some points.

1013
01:22:40,372 --> 01:22:43,057
And what did your wife say
when she saw your face?

1014
01:22:49,252 --> 01:22:52,734
She said, "Sweetie,
you don't need a face to drive.

1015
01:22:52,812 --> 01:22:54,940
"You just need a right foot."

1016
01:22:55,252 --> 01:22:57,619
I'm being serious.

1017
01:22:57,812 --> 01:23:02,295
Do you really think your marriage can
survive with the way you look now?

1018
01:23:04,932 --> 01:23:06,980
And I'm being serious, too.

1019
01:23:07,972 --> 01:23:10,942
Fuck you. Press conference over.

1020
01:23:16,132 --> 01:23:17,941
- That was hairy.
- Well, you got noticed, Clive.

1021
01:23:17,972 --> 01:23:19,258
I'll tell you that.

1022
01:23:19,332 --> 01:23:20,936
I thought it went well,
to be honest.

1023
01:23:21,012 --> 01:23:22,776
They don't like it
when it's not going their way.

1024
01:23:22,812 --> 01:23:24,496
- Clive.
- That's the game.

1025
01:23:24,612 --> 01:23:26,853
- See you.
- See you later.

1026
01:23:26,932 --> 01:23:28,821
- James, are you all right?
- Good, yeah.

1027
01:23:28,932 --> 01:23:30,616
Listen, I think
I've got something for you

1028
01:23:30,692 --> 01:23:32,456
on that last question, about Niki.

1029
01:23:32,492 --> 01:23:35,098
- You heard about that?
- I did.

1030
01:23:36,332 --> 01:23:38,061
James.

1031
01:23:44,292 --> 01:23:46,863
Please, James...

1032
01:23:47,852 --> 01:23:50,776
Now go home to your wife
and ask her how you look.

1033
01:23:53,212 --> 01:23:54,623
Prick.

1034
01:24:11,492 --> 01:24:16,373
So Niki Lauda, just 42 days after
his near-fatal accident at Nurburgring,

1035
01:24:16,492 --> 01:24:17,982
will race here today at Monza

1036
01:24:18,052 --> 01:24:21,818
against all medical advice
and no doubt in incredible pain.

1037
01:24:54,532 --> 01:24:56,182
<i>...Niki Lauda!</i>

1038
01:25:04,892 --> 01:25:07,293
<i>Photographers,
please clear the grid.</i>

1039
01:25:07,532 --> 01:25:09,694
Niki, it's time.

1040
01:25:11,212 --> 01:25:12,702
Okay?

1041
01:25:19,372 --> 01:25:20,783
<i>Please clear the grid.</i>

1042
01:25:23,412 --> 01:25:25,540
<i>One minute to go.</i>

1043
01:26:11,332 --> 01:26:14,176
<i>The returning Niki Lauda
seems overwhelmed.</i>

1044
01:26:14,252 --> 01:26:16,698
<i>He's being overtaken by car after car.</i>

1045
01:26:26,492 --> 01:26:29,621
<i>Lauda's off line.
He runs wide onto the grass.</i>

1046
01:26:34,452 --> 01:26:36,136
<i>He wrestles it back onto the track,</i>

1047
01:26:36,332 --> 01:26:39,142
<i>but that was a bad moment for Niki.</i>

1048
01:26:43,012 --> 01:26:45,219
<i>Niki Lauda's the reigning
world champion,</i>

1049
01:26:45,292 --> 01:26:48,501
<i>but maybe in his current state
he's a danger out there,</i>

1050
01:26:48,652 --> 01:26:51,462
<i>to himself and to the rest of the field.</i>

1051
01:26:53,452 --> 01:26:57,343
<i>And Stuck has collided
with Mario Andretti's Lotus!</i>

1052
01:26:57,492 --> 01:27:00,655
<i>Niki's boxed in. He's got nowhere to go.</i>

1053
01:27:15,092 --> 01:27:18,653
<i>Niki Lauda is actually
making a move. He's on Brambilla's tail.</i>

1054
01:27:21,932 --> 01:27:24,583
<i>He pulls out of the slipstream
to overtake.</i>

1055
01:27:25,332 --> 01:27:27,653
<i>Lauda's starting to find the form</i>

1056
01:27:27,772 --> 01:27:29,740
<i>that, early in this race,
we believed he'd lost.</i>

1057
01:27:36,172 --> 01:27:40,257
Lauda's now lapping faster than
Reutemann and closing the gap ahead.

1058
01:27:44,172 --> 01:27:46,743
<i>Lauda closing on Carlos Reutemann,</i>

1059
01:27:46,852 --> 01:27:50,015
<i>the man called in to be his replacement
in the Ferrari team.</i>

1060
01:27:59,052 --> 01:28:00,861
<i>And there's James Hunt's McLaren,</i>

1061
01:28:00,972 --> 01:28:03,418
<i>smoking stationary
by the side of the road.</i>

1062
01:28:07,052 --> 01:28:10,135
<i>This is bad news for Hunt's
championship hopes.</i>

1063
01:28:14,532 --> 01:28:15,943
<i>It's Ronnie Peterson</i>

1064
01:28:16,052 --> 01:28:18,419
<i>who comes home the winner here at Monza.</i>

1065
01:28:18,612 --> 01:28:21,502
<i>But all eyes are on the man
who finishes a brilliant fourth,</i>

1066
01:28:22,452 --> 01:28:24,580
<i>- Niki Lauda!</i>

1067
01:29:05,452 --> 01:29:07,773
<i>What a race, what a man,
what a season.</i>

1068
01:29:07,852 --> 01:29:10,014
With a fourth-place finish
and three priceless points,

1069
01:29:10,092 --> 01:29:12,094
it means that Niki Lauda
is a major step closer

1070
01:29:12,132 --> 01:29:14,339
to retaining the World Championship.

1071
01:30:13,492 --> 01:30:17,019
<i>So, the long, gruelling
and incredibly dramatic season</i>

1072
01:30:17,052 --> 01:30:19,419
<i>comes down to this final race in Japan</i>

1073
01:30:19,492 --> 01:30:22,018
<i>in the shadow of Mount Fuji.</i>

1074
01:30:22,092 --> 01:30:23,537
<i>Niki Lauda goes into</i>

1075
01:30:23,572 --> 01:30:25,017
<i>this deciding race at Fuji</i>

1076
01:30:25,092 --> 01:30:27,254
<i>just three points ahead of James Hunt.</i>

1077
01:30:27,332 --> 01:30:31,621
<i>Hunt knowing he must beat the Austrian
fair and square to take the title.</i>

1078
01:30:33,172 --> 01:30:36,699
James, do you think
you can cope with the pressure?

1079
01:30:36,732 --> 01:30:40,259
Well, I've never really understood
what that means. I love my job.

1080
01:30:40,372 --> 01:30:42,420
I love competing. I love racing.

1081
01:30:42,612 --> 01:30:44,455
<i>Maybe you should ask Niki.</i>

1082
01:30:44,532 --> 01:30:46,853
He's the World Champion.
He's got everything to lose.

1083
01:30:46,892 --> 01:30:49,213
<i>Mr Lauda,
are you feeling pressure?</i>

1084
01:30:49,292 --> 01:30:51,738
Do I look like I'm feeling pressure?

1085
01:30:53,812 --> 01:30:57,942
I am World Champion, and on the verge
to become World Champion again.

1086
01:30:58,052 --> 01:31:00,054
Hunt now has the opportunity to win,

1087
01:31:00,132 --> 01:31:02,214
but it's not so easy
to become a champion.

1088
01:31:02,292 --> 01:31:05,421
You have to really believe it
to make it possible.

1089
01:31:05,572 --> 01:31:07,620
James, is there anything
you'd like to add?

1090
01:31:07,732 --> 01:31:11,657
If Niki is being tricky and getting
a kicky out of playing mind games...

1091
01:31:11,732 --> 01:31:14,099
...then fine, I'm flattered.

1092
01:31:14,212 --> 01:31:17,773
But the fact is, momentum is with me.
I've never felt better.

1093
01:31:17,892 --> 01:31:20,463
And I fully expect the next
press conference we will have

1094
01:31:20,572 --> 01:31:22,734
will be with me as World Champion.

1095
01:31:24,572 --> 01:31:27,018
How will you cope
with the weather, bad conditions?

1096
01:31:27,092 --> 01:31:30,574
Intermittent heavy rain
has been forecast here at Fuji today,

1097
01:31:30,652 --> 01:31:34,134
along with strong winds
and occasional fog

1098
01:31:34,252 --> 01:31:36,141
rolling in from the mountain.

1099
01:31:37,932 --> 01:31:40,583
<i>And so, with today's
Japanese Grand Prix to come,</i>

1100
01:31:40,652 --> 01:31:42,416
<i>Lauda's lead a mere three points.</i>

1101
01:31:42,492 --> 01:31:44,176
<i>What a way to finish the season.</i>

1102
01:31:44,772 --> 01:31:46,262
<i>Hunt or Lauda?</i>

1103
01:31:46,332 --> 01:31:49,336
<i>Well, the final chapter will unfold when
we bring you extended coverage...</i>

1104
01:31:49,452 --> 01:31:52,501
They've got to cancel the race.
It's lethal out there.

1105
01:31:52,572 --> 01:31:54,700
The race is going ahead.

1106
01:31:54,772 --> 01:31:56,615
Television rights have been sold
all around the world.

1107
01:31:56,692 --> 01:31:59,343
The showdown between you and Niki
is all anyone wants to see.

1108
01:31:59,412 --> 01:32:02,814
With heavy rain
continuing to fall here at Fuji,

1109
01:32:02,892 --> 01:32:04,974
a decision has finally been made.

1110
01:32:05,092 --> 01:32:09,017
The 1976 Japanese Grand Prix
will go ahead.

1111
01:32:09,092 --> 01:32:11,777
<i>AH drivers
to your cars, please.</i>

1112
01:32:36,412 --> 01:32:37,823
<i>Five minutes to go.</i>

1113
01:33:21,012 --> 01:33:22,457
- All right?
- All right.

1114
01:33:22,532 --> 01:33:24,853
- Hold still.
- What the hell are you doing?

1115
01:33:24,932 --> 01:33:26,661
To let the condensation out.

1116
01:33:26,732 --> 01:33:29,463
- It'll also let the water in.
- Not if you're leading.

1117
01:33:29,532 --> 01:33:31,899
Trust me,
this race is all about the start.

1118
01:33:33,812 --> 01:33:36,383
- Need a hand here?
- Yeah, hold it, Teddy.

1119
01:33:50,852 --> 01:33:52,502
Okay, start the bastard.

1120
01:33:55,492 --> 01:33:57,142
Good luck, kid.

1121
01:33:58,532 --> 01:33:59,943
Good luck, James.

1122
01:34:39,492 --> 01:34:41,494
<i>Thirty seconds to go.</i>

1123
01:35:00,932 --> 01:35:03,094
<i>Electric tension here at Fuji.</i>

1124
01:35:03,172 --> 01:35:08,212
<i>80,000 bedraggled race fans and
the racing grudge match of the decade.</i>

1125
01:35:08,292 --> 01:35:10,420
<i>And there's Mario Andretti
in pole position,</i>

1126
01:35:10,492 --> 01:35:12,494
<i>James Hunt alongside him.</i>

1127
01:35:14,652 --> 01:35:16,575
<i>On Row 2 of the grid,</i>

1128
01:35:16,652 --> 01:35:18,541
<i>there is Niki Lauda,</i>

1129
01:35:18,612 --> 01:35:21,058
<i>and on Row 3 of the grid,
Jody Scheckter from South Africa</i>

1130
01:35:21,132 --> 01:35:22,577
<i>in the six-wheel Tyrrell.</i>

1131
01:35:22,652 --> 01:35:24,734
<i>Behind him,
the rest of the 25-car field.</i>

1132
01:35:42,572 --> 01:35:46,577
There's the flag, and finally
the Japanese Grand Prix is underway!

1133
01:35:58,812 --> 01:36:01,975
<i>In these conditions,
it must be almost impossible to drive</i>

1134
01:36:02,052 --> 01:36:04,054
<i>a 450-horsepower car.</i>

1135
01:36:31,212 --> 01:36:34,216
<i>And it's Andretti who has the lead,
but Hunt is attacking.</i>

1136
01:36:34,292 --> 01:36:37,262
<i>Hunt's going round
the outside of Andretti.</i>

1137
01:36:37,332 --> 01:36:38,902
<i>Niki Lauda following him through.</i>

1138
01:36:38,972 --> 01:36:41,737
<i>Hunt leads into the first right-hander.</i>

1139
01:37:24,812 --> 01:37:26,572
<i>Hunt comes through
to complete his first lap,</i>

1140
01:37:26,612 --> 01:37:28,023
<i>leading the field.</i>

1141
01:37:28,092 --> 01:37:30,220
<i>At least he has clear vision
in front of him.</i>

1142
01:37:30,332 --> 01:37:32,494
<i>Niki Lauda, behind him,
eating his spray.</i>

1143
01:37:51,972 --> 01:37:53,383
<i>Lauda is slowing.</i>

1144
01:37:53,452 --> 01:37:56,342
<i>Niki Lauda is bringing
the Ferrari number one into the pit.</i>

1145
01:37:58,092 --> 01:38:01,301
<i>Some sort of problem, we can't
imagine what, so early in the race.</i>

1146
01:38:07,612 --> 01:38:11,059
What's wrong with the car?
What's wrong with the car?

1147
01:38:12,212 --> 01:38:13,941
Niki, what's wrong with the car?

1148
01:38:14,292 --> 01:38:16,374
Nothing. Car's perfect.

1149
01:38:20,772 --> 01:38:23,139
- What are you doing?
- I'm stopping.

1150
01:38:23,212 --> 01:38:25,374
<i>His mechanics
are asking what the problem is.</i>

1151
01:38:25,452 --> 01:38:27,773
<i>But wait!
Niki Lauda's getting out of the car!</i>

1152
01:38:27,892 --> 01:38:29,496
This is sensational!

1153
01:38:29,572 --> 01:38:32,496
The reigning World Champion,
Niki Lauda, is out of this race.

1154
01:38:33,412 --> 01:38:35,096
It's too dangerous.

1155
01:38:35,172 --> 01:38:38,381
Niki, you want me to say there was
a problem with the car, for the media?

1156
01:38:39,692 --> 01:38:41,182
No.

1157
01:38:41,572 --> 01:38:42,983
Tell them the truth.

1158
01:38:43,852 --> 01:38:45,422
<i>Now, what is happening?</i>

1159
01:38:45,532 --> 01:38:49,457
<i>They're talking to the team manager.
Lauda explaining something.</i>

1160
01:39:05,012 --> 01:39:08,300
<i>With Lauda out, James Hunt
knows he has to finish this race</i>

1161
01:39:08,372 --> 01:39:12,138
<i>in third place or higher
to be World Champion.</i>

1162
01:39:12,212 --> 01:39:14,897
<i>But the job's not done yet
for James Hunt.</i>

1163
01:39:14,972 --> 01:39:19,580
<i>In these dreadful conditions,
he still has to go the distance.</i>

1164
01:39:20,692 --> 01:39:22,535
<i>Fifteen laps to go here at Fuji.</i>

1165
01:39:22,652 --> 01:39:24,734
<i>James Hunt or Niki Lauda?</i>

1166
01:39:24,812 --> 01:39:27,895
<i>This extraordinary season
is not over yet.</i>

1167
01:39:27,972 --> 01:39:31,419
<i>In this treacherous final round,
can James Hunt hang on?</i>

1168
01:39:31,932 --> 01:39:33,775
<i>And the scoreboard tells a story.</i>

1169
01:39:33,852 --> 01:39:36,662
<i>Lap 58. Hunt in the lead.</i>

1170
01:39:38,652 --> 01:39:40,495
Oh, God, his tyres, they're blistering.

1171
01:39:42,132 --> 01:39:43,896
<i>Brambilla very close behind now,</i>

1172
01:39:43,972 --> 01:39:45,940
<i>closing on him all the time now.</i>

1173
01:39:46,052 --> 01:39:49,215
<i>And he's trying to drive
inside James Hunt.</i>

1174
01:39:49,292 --> 01:39:51,818
<i>Hunt cuts across the orange March nose.</i>

1175
01:39:51,932 --> 01:39:54,219
<i>Hunt's not having that at all.
And he's spinning.</i>

1176
01:39:54,292 --> 01:39:57,455
<i>He missed Hunt there, but almost
took James Hunt out of the race</i>

1177
01:39:57,532 --> 01:39:59,899
<i>and out of the world championship.</i>

1178
01:39:59,972 --> 01:40:02,703
<i>Now we find Mario Andretti
closing on James Hunt.</i>

1179
01:40:07,252 --> 01:40:09,220
<i>Mario Andretti's going past Hunt!</i>

1180
01:40:09,692 --> 01:40:12,696
<i>Hunt is slowing. James Hunt
seems to have a problem.</i>

1181
01:40:18,532 --> 01:40:20,296
<i>Despite these wet conditions,</i>

1182
01:40:20,372 --> 01:40:22,101
<i>these wet-weather tyres
do wear extremely fast.</i>

1183
01:40:22,212 --> 01:40:24,340
Hunt's tyres, they've gone.

1184
01:40:24,572 --> 01:40:28,258
<i>Hunt nursing his car
back to the pit stop.</i>

1185
01:40:30,252 --> 01:40:32,300
<i>That back marker's going past Hunt.</i>

1186
01:40:44,732 --> 01:40:47,417
<i>Look at that left front tyre...
Right front tyre, sorry.</i>

1187
01:40:47,492 --> 01:40:50,655
<i>No tread on it at all.
And the other one is flat.</i>

1188
01:40:50,812 --> 01:40:52,940
Let's go! Let's go!

1189
01:40:57,492 --> 01:40:59,893
Okay? When did you break
your gear lever?

1190
01:40:59,972 --> 01:41:01,576
Nine or ten laps ago.

1191
01:41:01,652 --> 01:41:04,098
- Alastair, we need to lift it.
- Come on!

1192
01:41:04,212 --> 01:41:05,896
<i>- At the front.
-  Let's go.</i>

1193
01:41:05,972 --> 01:41:09,181
<i>Regazzoni's Ferrari
and Jacques Lafitte in the Ligier</i>

1194
01:41:09,252 --> 01:41:10,902
have gone ahead.

1195
01:41:11,012 --> 01:41:12,616
Come on, hurry!

1196
01:41:12,692 --> 01:41:15,741
You did it.
You're going to be World Champion!

1197
01:41:15,812 --> 01:41:17,257
Not yet.

1198
01:41:17,332 --> 01:41:21,098
<i>A few laps ago, James Hunt
was looking like champion elect.</i>

1199
01:41:21,172 --> 01:41:23,539
<i>Now it looks as though
it's all gone wrong for him.</i>

1200
01:41:24,972 --> 01:41:26,383
- James.
- Come on!

1201
01:41:26,452 --> 01:41:27,897
- Listen.
- What?

1202
01:41:27,972 --> 01:41:30,213
Just go easy out there.

1203
01:41:30,292 --> 01:41:34,263
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying look after yourself.

1204
01:41:34,332 --> 01:41:36,221
We want you back in one piece.

1205
01:41:36,292 --> 01:41:39,660
You're too far back. There's
too many drivers in front of you.

1206
01:41:39,732 --> 01:41:43,737
- There's always next year.
- So that's it? It's over?

1207
01:41:44,132 --> 01:41:45,622
Clear!

1208
01:41:45,692 --> 01:41:47,217
<i>James.</i>

1209
01:41:48,892 --> 01:41:50,815
- Clear!
- Fuck it!

1210
01:41:54,732 --> 01:41:57,975
James Hunt rejoins the race
in sixth position.

1211
01:41:58,052 --> 01:42:01,943
<i>There are four laps left to go.
Surely no way back for the Brit now.</i>

1212
01:42:21,812 --> 01:42:23,052
Concentrate, Superstar.

1213
01:42:23,252 --> 01:42:24,936
<i>Just brings it back under control.</i>

1214
01:42:25,052 --> 01:42:26,258
<i>Sliding the McLaren</i>

1215
01:42:26,332 --> 01:42:27,572
<i>on the very edge there.</i>

1216
01:42:29,492 --> 01:42:30,778
<i>Hunt's M23</i>

1217
01:42:30,892 --> 01:42:32,532
<i>twitching this way and that
under braking.</i>

1218
01:42:32,572 --> 01:42:33,972
And he almost loses it right there.

1219
01:42:34,092 --> 01:42:36,813
<i>Hunt on the tail
of Jacques Lafitte in the blue Ligier.</i>

1220
01:42:44,772 --> 01:42:46,183
Oh, don't do it, James.

1221
01:42:49,612 --> 01:42:51,182
<i>He's inches away
from the pit wall.</i>

1222
01:42:51,252 --> 01:42:53,061
<i>He's inches away from the Ligier.</i>

1223
01:43:02,092 --> 01:43:04,493
<i>James Hunt has made up another place,</i>

1224
01:43:04,572 --> 01:43:05,573
<i>but it's not enough,</i>

1225
01:43:05,652 --> 01:43:06,892
<i>and this race is running out.</i>

1226
01:43:15,932 --> 01:43:17,934
<i>And Watson has spun.
Watson has spun.</i>

1227
01:43:22,572 --> 01:43:25,337
<i>Hunt manages to weave his way
between that back marker</i>

1228
01:43:25,412 --> 01:43:27,414
<i>and the stationary Penske.</i>

1229
01:43:27,492 --> 01:43:29,494
He's catching Regazzoni

1230
01:43:29,572 --> 01:43:31,222
but, in these conditions,
it's one thing to catch up,

1231
01:43:31,292 --> 01:43:33,499
it's quite another to overtake.

1232
01:43:36,892 --> 01:43:41,022
<i>He's alongside Clay Regazzoni.
This could be the world championship.</i>

1233
01:43:49,452 --> 01:43:50,977
<i>He's got him!</i>

1234
01:44:06,252 --> 01:44:08,334
<i>Hunt crosses the line.</i>

1235
01:44:08,412 --> 01:44:12,019
<i>Now, he needed to finish third to score
enough points to be World Champion,</i>

1236
01:44:12,092 --> 01:44:16,620
<i>and in the confusion here, we're being
told that he may have finished fifth.</i>

1237
01:44:16,692 --> 01:44:18,820
He finished fifth?

1238
01:44:18,892 --> 01:44:21,702
<i>Our lap charts
show Hunt in third place.</i>

1239
01:44:21,772 --> 01:44:23,695
<i>Well, if the scoreboard's right,</i>

1240
01:44:23,772 --> 01:44:26,298
<i>it means he's just missed out
on the championship.</i>

1241
01:44:26,372 --> 01:44:30,013
<i>Crushing defeat for Hunt
after such a heroic drive.</i>

1242
01:44:33,972 --> 01:44:36,498
I can see the race stewards conferring,

1243
01:44:36,572 --> 01:44:38,222
examining the official lap charts.

1244
01:44:38,292 --> 01:44:40,693
<i>We're just going to have to wait
for their verdict here.</i>

1245
01:44:58,332 --> 01:44:59,902
Let's get you out of there, buddy.

1246
01:44:59,972 --> 01:45:02,054
I'm sorry, Teddy. I'm sorry.
I thought I could make up the ground.

1247
01:45:02,132 --> 01:45:04,214
Sorry? What are you talking about?
You did it.

1248
01:45:04,292 --> 01:45:07,057
- Did what?
- Jesus. You crazy bastard.

1249
01:45:07,132 --> 01:45:10,341
You came third. You got the points.
You're champion of the world!

1250
01:45:10,852 --> 01:45:14,095
<i>James Hunt
is now officially confirmed</i>

1251
01:45:14,212 --> 01:45:16,260
<i>as finishing third here in Japan,</i>

1252
01:45:16,892 --> 01:45:20,533
<i>and that means
he is champion of the world.</i>

1253
01:45:22,012 --> 01:45:27,303
<i>Our new World Champion,
James Hunt, by just one single point.</i>

1254
01:45:32,492 --> 01:45:33,982
<i>Did we really win?</i>

1255
01:45:38,052 --> 01:45:40,293
World bloody Champion!

1256
01:45:49,092 --> 01:45:50,981
Tell us, James,
what are you going to do now?

1257
01:45:51,052 --> 01:45:53,214
I shall be getting drunk.

1258
01:45:53,732 --> 01:45:56,463
It's wonderful,
an absolute dream...

1259
01:46:43,452 --> 01:46:45,454
<i>And our special guest,</i>

1260
01:46:45,532 --> 01:46:47,375
<i>Formula 1 champion James Hunt.</i>

1261
01:47:10,772 --> 01:47:12,854
Wait. Come on.

1262
01:47:16,012 --> 01:47:17,502
<i>There's no better motor oil</i>

1263
01:47:17,572 --> 01:47:19,176
<i>than Havoline.</i>

1264
01:47:29,692 --> 01:47:31,615
Yes, me, too.
Where are we going?

1265
01:47:31,692 --> 01:47:33,182
Anywhere I want to go.

1266
01:47:33,252 --> 01:47:35,533
And I don't have to hijack it, either.

1267
01:47:35,572 --> 01:47:37,222
As long as I pay for it.

1268
01:47:37,292 --> 01:47:39,613
I'm starving.
Let's get some food.

1269
01:47:50,732 --> 01:47:52,461
- Where are we going?
- You lot go ahead.

1270
01:47:52,532 --> 01:47:54,500
I won't be a minute.

1271
01:48:00,412 --> 01:48:02,016
Good to see you.

1272
01:48:06,092 --> 01:48:08,493
I heard you were spending
more and more time in one of these.

1273
01:48:08,892 --> 01:48:10,860
- Do you fly?
- No.

1274
01:48:11,252 --> 01:48:12,742
I don't think they'd insure me.

1275
01:48:12,892 --> 01:48:14,735
You should try.
It's good for discipline.

1276
01:48:14,932 --> 01:48:17,412
You have to stay within the rules,
stick to regulations,

1277
01:48:17,532 --> 01:48:20,103
suppress the ego.
It helps with the racing.

1278
01:48:20,212 --> 01:48:23,182
And there I was thinking
you were about to wax lyrical

1279
01:48:23,252 --> 01:48:24,856
about the romance of flight.

1280
01:48:25,212 --> 01:48:26,782
No, that's all bullshit.

1281
01:48:27,932 --> 01:48:29,377
So, what brings you here?

1282
01:48:30,532 --> 01:48:33,012
A friend's wedding.
At least I think it was a wedding.

1283
01:48:33,092 --> 01:48:35,936
Might have been a birthday or something.
It's all a bit of a blur.

1284
01:48:36,012 --> 01:48:37,298
How about you? Have you been at Fiorano?

1285
01:48:37,332 --> 01:48:38,493
Pre-season testing.

1286
01:48:38,612 --> 01:48:40,535
- You're relentless.
- Thank you.

1287
01:48:40,612 --> 01:48:42,774
I'm not sure that was meant
as a compliment.

1288
01:48:42,852 --> 01:48:45,139
When do you start testing? Next week?

1289
01:48:45,172 --> 01:48:47,140
No. What, are you nuts?

1290
01:48:47,212 --> 01:48:48,941
I didn't just win
the biggest thing of my life

1291
01:48:49,012 --> 01:48:50,457
so I could get right back to work.

1292
01:48:51,772 --> 01:48:54,457
Why? You have to.

1293
01:48:54,772 --> 01:48:58,140
To prove to all the people who will
always say you just won it because...

1294
01:48:58,212 --> 01:49:01,614
Because of what?
Because of your accident?

1295
01:49:03,132 --> 01:49:05,180
Niki, is that other people,
or is that you?

1296
01:49:05,812 --> 01:49:08,895
I won, okay? On the all-important day,
when it came down to it,

1297
01:49:08,972 --> 01:49:11,816
we raced on equal terms,
equally good cars.

1298
01:49:11,892 --> 01:49:14,054
And I put my life on the line,
and I saw it through.

1299
01:49:14,132 --> 01:49:16,180
- And you call that winning?
- Yes.

1300
01:49:16,292 --> 01:49:18,374
The risks were totally unacceptable.

1301
01:49:18,892 --> 01:49:21,372
You were prepared to die.
To me, that's losing.

1302
01:49:21,492 --> 01:49:23,062
Yes, I was. I admit it.

1303
01:49:23,132 --> 01:49:25,976
I was prepared to die
to beat you that day.

1304
01:49:26,012 --> 01:49:28,982
And that's the effect you have on me.
You'd pushed me that far.

1305
01:49:29,092 --> 01:49:30,503
And it felt great.

1306
01:49:31,412 --> 01:49:33,733
I mean, hell,
isn't that what we're in this for?

1307
01:49:33,812 --> 01:49:37,180
To stare death in the face
and to cheat it?

1308
01:49:37,532 --> 01:49:41,332
Come on, there's nobility in that.
It's... It's like being knights.

1309
01:49:42,332 --> 01:49:44,096
You English, you're such assholes.

1310
01:49:45,052 --> 01:49:46,497
You know my position.

1311
01:49:46,772 --> 01:49:48,183
Twenty per cent risk.

1312
01:49:48,252 --> 01:49:52,018
No, no, no, Niki, don't bring the
percentages into this. Don't be a pro.

1313
01:49:52,052 --> 01:49:54,703
The minute you do that,
you kill what's good about this.

1314
01:49:55,012 --> 01:49:56,776
You kill the sport.

1315
01:49:59,892 --> 01:50:01,542
James!

1316
01:50:01,852 --> 01:50:03,695
- James!
- Come on!

1317
01:50:06,692 --> 01:50:08,057
I've got to go.

1318
01:50:09,572 --> 01:50:11,540
Careful in this thing.

1319
01:50:12,572 --> 01:50:14,062
James.

1320
01:50:19,292 --> 01:50:23,058
You know, in hospital, the toughest part
of my treatment was the vacuum.

1321
01:50:23,372 --> 01:50:26,296
Pumping the shit out of my lungs.
It was hell.

1322
01:50:27,372 --> 01:50:29,295
And while doing it,
I was watching television.

1323
01:50:29,892 --> 01:50:32,657
- You winning all my points.
- Your points?

1324
01:50:32,732 --> 01:50:34,939
"That bastard Hunt," I would say.
"I hate that guy."

1325
01:50:35,492 --> 01:50:37,574
And then one day
the doctor came and said,

1326
01:50:37,652 --> 01:50:39,939
"Mr Lauda,
may I offer a piece of advice?

1327
01:50:40,052 --> 01:50:43,738
"Stop thinking of it as a curse to
have been given an enemy in life.

1328
01:50:43,812 --> 01:50:45,974
"It can be a blessing, too.

1329
01:50:46,052 --> 01:50:48,817
"A wise man gets more from his enemies
than a fool from his friends."

1330
01:50:49,452 --> 01:50:51,739
And you know what? He was right.

1331
01:50:54,332 --> 01:50:58,098
Look at us. We were both
a pair of kids when we met.

1332
01:50:58,132 --> 01:50:59,941
Hot-headed jerks in Formula 3.

1333
01:50:59,972 --> 01:51:01,815
Disowned by our families.

1334
01:51:01,932 --> 01:51:03,297
Headed nowhere.

1335
01:51:04,412 --> 01:51:06,699
And now we're both
champions of the world.

1336
01:51:06,772 --> 01:51:08,183
It was not bad, huh?

1337
01:51:09,252 --> 01:51:11,175
No, it's not bad.

1338
01:51:11,252 --> 01:51:14,813
So, don't let me down now.
I need you busting my balls.

1339
01:51:15,252 --> 01:51:18,017
- Get back to work.
- I will, Niki, I will.

1340
01:51:18,772 --> 01:51:20,820
But I intend to enjoy myself first.

1341
01:51:21,172 --> 01:51:23,493
Some of life needs to be for pleasure.

1342
01:51:23,612 --> 01:51:26,934
What's the point of having
a million cups and medals and planes

1343
01:51:27,012 --> 01:51:29,174
if you don't have any fun?

1344
01:51:29,972 --> 01:51:31,701
How is that winning?

1345
01:51:32,772 --> 01:51:35,503
- James!
- We're gonna leave without you!

1346
01:51:36,012 --> 01:51:37,457
James!

1347
01:51:41,292 --> 01:51:42,703
I'll see you on race day, champ.

1348
01:51:44,452 --> 01:51:46,614
You will... champ.

1349
01:51:49,132 --> 01:51:50,896
You look good, Niki.

1350
01:51:51,452 --> 01:51:54,342
The only guy to have his face burnt off
and it be an improvement.

1351
01:52:01,172 --> 01:52:03,220
<i>Of course,
he didn't listen to me.</i>

1352
01:52:03,292 --> 01:52:04,737
<i>For James,</i>

1353
01:52:04,812 --> 01:52:06,974
<i>one world title was enough.</i>

1354
01:52:07,012 --> 01:52:08,502
<i>He had proved</i>

1355
01:52:08,532 --> 01:52:11,820
<i>what he needed to prove, to himself</i>

1356
01:52:11,892 --> 01:52:14,179
<i>and anyone who doubted him.</i>

1357
01:52:15,012 --> 01:52:16,901
<i>And two years later he retired.</i>

1358
01:52:17,172 --> 01:52:20,813
<i>When I saw him next in London
seven years later,</i>

1359
01:52:20,932 --> 01:52:23,060
<i>me as champion again,</i>

1360
01:52:23,172 --> 01:52:25,061
<i>him as broadcaster,</i>

1361
01:52:25,132 --> 01:52:29,535
<i>he was barefoot
on a bicycle with a flat tyre.</i>

1362
01:52:29,652 --> 01:52:32,496
<i>Still living each day like his last.</i>

1363
01:52:34,252 --> 01:52:35,742
<i>When I heard he'd died,</i>

1364
01:52:35,852 --> 01:52:38,219
<i>aged 45, of a heart attack,</i>

1365
01:52:38,332 --> 01:52:39,857
<i>I wasn't surprised.</i>

1366
01:52:40,852 --> 01:52:42,741
<i>I was just sad.</i>

1367
01:52:44,092 --> 01:52:45,935
<i>People always think of us as rivals,</i>

1368
01:52:46,012 --> 01:52:49,619
<i>but he was among the very few I liked,</i>

1369
01:52:50,932 --> 01:52:53,902
<i>and even fewer that I respected.</i>

1370
01:52:57,052 --> 01:52:59,783
<i>He remains the only person I envied.</i>
