so early walking
did I see your son.

but he was ware of me,

the cover of the wood.

he there been seen.

Thou's hear our counsel.

184
00:13:43,233 --> 00:13:45,110
Thou knowest my daughter's
of a pretty age.

185
00:13:45,235 --> 00:13:47,112
I can tell her age
unto an hour.

186
00:13:47,238 --> 00:13:48,531
She's not fourteen.

187
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,533
I'll lay fourteen
of my teeth.

188
00:13:50,617 --> 00:13:52,536
And yet to
my teen be it spoke,

189
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,539
I have but four,
she's not fourteen.

190
00:13:54,622 --> 00:13:56,207
How long is it
to Lammastide?

191
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,043
A fortnight and odd days.

192
00:13:58,127 --> 00:14:00,421
Even or odd, of all
the days of the year,

193
00:14:00,547 --> 00:14:02,424
come Lammas Eve at night
shall she be fourteen.

194
00:14:02,507 --> 00:14:03,925
Susan and she--

195
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,428
God rest all Christian
souls were of an age.

196
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,932
Well, Susan is with God.
She was too good for me.

197
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:10,809
But, as I said,
on Lammas Eve

198
00:14:10,935 --> 00:14:13,021
at night
shall she be fourteen.

199
00:14:13,021 --> 00:14:15,232
That shall she, marry!
I remember it well.

200
00:14:15,316 --> 00:14:18,945
My lord and you
were then at Mantua!

201
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:21,532
Nay, I do bear a brain.

202
00:14:21,532 --> 00:14:24,035
For then she could,
she could stand high lone.

203
00:14:24,035 --> 00:14:27,038
Nay, by the road she could have
run and waddled all about,

204
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:30,042
for even the day before
she broke her brow;

205
00:14:30,043 --> 00:14:33,922
and then my husband-- God rest his soul,
'a were a merry man--

206
00:14:34,048 --> 00:14:35,424
took up the child.

207
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:39,054
"Yea," quoth he,
"dost thou fall upon thy face?

208
00:14:39,054 --> 00:14:41,932
"Thou wilt fall backward
when thou hast more wit;

209
00:14:42,058 --> 00:14:43,017
wilt thou not, Jule?"

210
00:14:43,018 --> 00:14:45,020
Nurse!

211
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,521
And by my holiday,

212
00:14:46,522 --> 00:14:49,025
the pretty wretch left
crying and said, "Ay."

213
00:14:49,025 --> 00:14:50,360
<i>[laughing]</i>

214
00:14:53,156 --> 00:14:56,034
Enough of this,
I pray thee hold thy peace.

215
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,663
Yes, madam.

216
00:14:58,746 --> 00:15:02,333

Thou was the prettiest babe
that 'er I nurs'd.

220
00:15:09,927 --> 00:15:11,929
And I might live to see
thee married once,

221
00:15:12,055 --> 00:15:13,932
I have my wish.

222
00:15:13,932 --> 00:15:20,440
Marry, that "marry" is the very theme
I came to talk of.

223
00:15:20,566 --> 00:15:21,734
Tell me,
daughter Juliet,

224
00:15:21,859 --> 00:15:24,946
how stands your disposition
to be married?

225
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,043
It is an honor
that I dream not of.

226
00:15:35,043 --> 00:15:37,546
An honor, were I not
thy only nurse,

227
00:15:37,546 --> 00:15:40,466
I would say thou hadst sucked
wisdom from my teat.

228
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:43,053
Well, think
of marriage now.

229
00:15:43,053 --> 00:15:46,056
Younger than you, here in Verona,
ladies of esteem,

230
00:15:46,057 --> 00:15:47,558
are made
already mothers.

231
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:50,062
By my count
I was your mother

232
00:15:50,062 --> 00:15:53,065
much upon these years
that you are now a maid.

233
00:15:53,066 --> 00:15:54,567
Oh, yes, I remember.

234
00:15:54,568 --> 00:15:57,363
Thus then, in brief...

235
00:15:57,447 --> 00:16:00,367
the valiant Paris
seeks you for his love.

236
00:16:00,367 --> 00:16:05,456
A man, young lady!
Lady, such as all the world--

237
00:16:05,582 --> 00:16:07,459
Why he's a man of wax.

238
00:16:07,543 --> 00:16:09,462
Verona's summer hath
not such a flower.

239
00:16:09,545 --> 00:16:11,464
Nay, he's
a flower in faith.

240
00:16:11,548 --> 00:16:12,966
Shh.

241
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:17,972
What say you?
Can you love the gentleman?

242
00:16:19,558 --> 00:16:21,351
Madam! Madam!

243
00:16:21,352 --> 00:16:23,479

We follow.

246
00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:32,074
Speak briefly,

247
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:37,581
I'll look to like,
if looking liking move.

248
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:41,085
But no more deep
will I endart mine eye,

249
00:16:41,086 --> 00:16:44,089
than your consent gives
strength to make it fly.

250
00:16:47,594 --> 00:16:50,556
Juliet, the county stays.

251
00:16:50,556 --> 00:16:52,057
Madam, I come.

252
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:58,566

What, shall this speech
be spoke for our excuse?

261

Or shall we on
without apology?

Let them measure us
by what they will.

264
00:17:46,378 --> 00:17:48,589
We'll measure them

Why, may one ask?

270
00:18:01,397 --> 00:18:05,485
I dreamt a dream tonight.

271
00:18:05,486 --> 00:18:07,279
Ho, and so did I.

272
00:18:07,405 --> 00:18:10,909
Well, what was yours?

Oh, then I see Queen Mab
hath been with you.

00:18:22,716 --> 00:18:25,302
Queen Mab?

277
00:18:25,386 --> 00:18:30,893
She is...She is
the fairies' midwife.

no bigger than
an agate stone

281
00:18:36,526 --> 00:18:38,486
on the forefinger
of an alderman,

282
00:18:38,612 --> 00:18:41,824
drawn with a team
of little atomies

283
00:18:41,907 --> 00:18:45,119
athwart men's noses
as they lie asleep.

284
00:18:45,203 --> 00:18:50,125
Her wagon spokes are made
of long spinner's legs;

285
00:18:50,126 --> 00:18:53,630
and the cover,
of the wings of grasshoppers;

286
00:18:53,631 --> 00:18:58,095
the traces
of the smallest spider's web;

287
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:04,019
and the collars, mmm,
of the moonshine's watery beams;

288
00:19:04,103 --> 00:19:06,522
her whip, crack!

289
00:19:06,606 --> 00:19:10,611
Is a cricket's bone;
the lash of film;

290
00:19:10,736 --> 00:19:13,030
and in this state

291
00:19:13,031 --> 00:19:15,701
she gallops night by night
through lovers' brains,

292
00:19:15,826 --> 00:19:19,205
and then they dream of love,

293
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:23,710
o'er ladies' lips,
who straight on kisses dream,

294
00:19:23,836 --> 00:19:29,217
which oft the angry Mab
with blisters plagues,

295
00:19:29,302 --> 00:19:32,222
because their breaths
with, er,

296
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:33,723
sweetmeats tainted are.

297
00:19:33,807 --> 00:19:37,228
Snd sometime comes she
with a tithe-pig's tail,

298
00:19:37,312 --> 00:19:40,232
tickling the parson's nose
as he lies asleep,

299
00:19:40,316 --> 00:19:45,447
and dreams he
of another benefice.

300
00:19:45,447 --> 00:19:49,243
<i>[all]</i> Amen.

Sometimes she driveth
o'er a soldier's neck,

303
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,126
and then dreams he

304
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:58,631
of cutting foreign throats,
of breaches,

305
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:01,843
ambuscadoes, spanish blades,
drums in his ear,

306
00:20:01,843 --> 00:20:03,344
at which he starts and wakes;

307
00:20:03,345 --> 00:20:06,849
and being thus frighted
tries a prayer or two...

308
00:20:11,814 --> 00:20:14,317
and sleeps again.

309
00:20:14,318 --> 00:20:16,320
This is that very Mab

310
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,323
that plaits the manes
of horses in the night,

311
00:20:19,324 --> 00:20:23,329
and bakes the elf-locks
in foul sluttish hairs,

312
00:20:23,329 --> 00:20:26,958
which once untangled
much misfortune bodes.

313
00:20:27,042 --> 00:20:31,339
This is the hag,
when maids lie on their backs,

314
00:20:31,423 --> 00:20:34,844
that presses them
and learns them first to bear

315
00:20:34,927 --> 00:20:39,349
making them women
of good carriage.

316
00:20:39,433 --> 00:20:41,143
This is she...

317
00:20:41,227 --> 00:20:44,356
This is she that...

318
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:48,153

Thou talk'st of nothing.

322
00:21:07,344 --> 00:21:09,054
True.

323
00:21:09,054 --> 00:21:13,351
True, I talk of dreams;

324
00:21:13,352 --> 00:21:17,357
which are the children
of an idle brain...

325
00:21:18,859 --> 00:21:23,364
Begot of nothing
but vain fantasy;

326
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:27,870
which is as thin
of substance as the air,

327
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,873
and more inconstant
than the wind

328
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:34,379
who woos even now
the frozen bosom of the north,

329
00:21:34,462 --> 00:21:38,341
and being angered
puffs away from thence,

330
00:21:38,467 --> 00:21:41,345

to the dew-dropping south.

331

00:41:38,089 --> 00:41:41,510
having some business,
do entreat her eyes

543
00:41:41,593 --> 00:41:45,514
to twinkle in their spheres
till they return.

544
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:48,602
See how she leans her cheek
upon her hand.

545
00:41:48,728 --> 00:41:52,107
Oh, that I were
a glove upon that hand,

546
00:41:52,232 --> 00:41:54,735
that I might touch
that cheek.

547
00:41:56,613 --> 00:41:58,323
Ay me!

548
00:41:58,407 --> 00:42:00,409
She speaks.

549
00:42:05,833 --> 00:42:09,212
Oh, speak again,
bright angel.

550
00:42:09,212 --> 00:42:14,009
O Romeo, Romeo,

551
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:17,514
wherefore art thou, Romeo?

552
00:42:17,514 --> 00:42:22,603
Deny thy father,
and refuse thy name.

553
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:26,609
Or if thou wilt not,
be but sworn my love,

554
00:42:26,735 --> 00:42:29,029
and I'll no longer
be a Capulet.

555
00:42:29,029 --> 00:42:30,530
Shall I hear more,

556
00:42:30,531 --> 00:42:32,533
or shall I speak at this?

557
00:42:32,617 --> 00:42:34,536
'Tis but thy name
that is my enemy.

558
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:38,333
Thou art thyself,
though not a Montague.

559
00:42:40,919 --> 00:42:42,629
What is Montague?

560
00:42:44,132 --> 00:42:49,639
It is nor hand nor foot,
nor arm nor face

561
00:42:49,722 --> 00:42:53,518
nor any other part
belonging to a man.

562
00:42:53,644 --> 00:42:56,731
O be some other name.

563
00:42:58,651 --> 00:43:00,737
What's in a name?

564
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:03,239
That which we call a rose

565
00:43:03,323 --> 00:43:06,326
by any other name
would smell as sweet;

566
00:43:06,327 --> 00:43:09,956
so Romeo would,
were he not Romeo called,

567
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,543
retain that dear perfection

568
00:43:12,543 --> 00:43:15,546
which he owes
without that title.

569
00:43:15,631 --> 00:43:19,052
Romeo, doff thy name,

570
00:43:19,052 --> 00:43:22,055
and for that name
which is no part of thee,

571
00:43:22,056 --> 00:43:24,142
take all myself.

572
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:29,231
I'll take thee
at thy word.

573
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:31,233
Call me but love,
and I'll be new baptized;

574
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:34,529
henceforth I never
will be Romeo.

575
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:38,034
What man art thou,
that thus bescreened in night

576
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,745
so stumblest
on my counsel?

577
00:43:39,828 --> 00:43:43,666
By a name I know not how to
tell thee who I am.

578
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:45,543
My name, dear saint,
is hateful to myself,

579
00:43:45,627 --> 00:43:46,962
because it is
an enemy to thee.

580
00:43:47,046 --> 00:43:49,841
Had I it written,
I would tear the word.

581
00:43:52,636 --> 00:43:55,055
My ears have not yet drunk

582
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:58,060
a hundred words
of that tongue's utterance,

583
00:43:58,144 --> 00:44:00,063
yet I know the sound.

584
00:44:00,146 --> 00:44:03,149
Art thou not Romeo,
and a Montague?

585
00:44:03,233 --> 00:44:05,652
Neither, fair maid,
if either thee dislike.

586
00:44:05,737 --> 00:44:08,448
How cam'st thou hither,
tell me and wherefore?

587
00:44:08,574 --> 00:44:10,952
The orchard walls are
high and hard to climb,

588
00:44:11,035 --> 00:44:13,371
and the place death,
considering who thou art,

589
00:44:13,455 --> 00:44:15,958
if any of my kinsmen
find thee here.

590
00:44:16,041 --> 00:44:17,542
With love's light wings

591
00:44:17,543 --> 00:44:19,545
did I o'er perch
these walls,

592
00:44:19,546 --> 00:44:22,049
for stony limits
cannot hold love out,

593
00:44:22,049 --> 00:44:25,052
and what love can do,
that dares love attempt.

594
00:44:25,053 --> 00:44:26,846
Therefore thy kinsmen
are no stop to me.

595
00:44:26,847 --> 00:44:27,973
Sshhh!

596
00:44:30,059 --> 00:44:33,062
If they do see thee,
they will murder thee.

597
00:44:33,147 --> 00:44:37,569
I have night's cloak to
hide me from their eyes.

598
00:44:37,569 --> 00:44:40,572
And but thou love me...

599
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:44,369
Let them find me here

600
00:44:44,453 --> 00:44:47,373
my life were better
ended by their hate,

601
00:44:47,457 --> 00:44:50,752
than death prorogued,
wanting of thy love.

602
00:44:53,673 --> 00:44:55,550
Dost thou love me?

603
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:58,762
I know thou wilt say ay,
and I will take thy word;

604
00:44:58,888 --> 00:45:00,264
yet if thou swearest,

605
00:45:00,348 --> 00:45:01,683
thou mayst prove false;

606
00:45:01,767 --> 00:45:06,189
at lovers' perjuries
they say jove laughs.

607
00:45:06,273 --> 00:45:08,484
O gentle Romeo,

608
00:45:08,567 --> 00:45:13,656
if thou dost love,
pronounce it faithfully.

609
00:45:13,782 --> 00:45:16,493
Or if thou thinkest
I am too quickly won,

610
00:45:16,577 --> 00:45:20,081
I'll frown and be perverse,
and say thee nay,

611
00:45:20,165 --> 00:45:23,460
so thou wilt woo
but else not for the world.

612
00:45:23,586 --> 00:45:28,675
In truth, fair Montague,
I am too fond...

613
00:45:31,764 --> 00:45:34,183
And therefore thou mayst think
my haviour light.

614
00:45:34,267 --> 00:45:35,393
No.

615
00:45:35,477 --> 00:45:38,188
But trust me, gentleman,
I'll prove more true

616
00:45:38,272 --> 00:45:40,274
than those that have
more cunning to be strange.

617
00:45:43,278 --> 00:45:45,697
I should have been
more strange,

618
00:45:45,782 --> 00:45:47,200
I must confess,

619
00:45:47,283 --> 00:45:50,203
but that thou overheard'st,
ere I was ware,

620
00:45:50,287 --> 00:45:52,665
my true love's passion;

621
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:56,670
therefore pardon me,

622
00:45:56,796 --> 00:45:59,674
and not impute this yielding
to light love,

623
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,595
which the dark night
hath so discovered.

624
00:46:02,678 --> 00:46:06,182
Lady, by yonder
blessed moon, I swear.

625
00:46:06,308 --> 00:46:08,185
Oh, swear not by the moon,

626
00:46:08,185 --> 00:46:09,686
th'inconstant moon,

627
00:46:09,771 --> 00:46:14,193
that monthly changes
in her circled orb,

628
00:46:14,276 --> 00:46:18,281
lest that thy love prove
likewise variable.

629
00:46:18,407 --> 00:46:20,785
What shall I swear by?

630
00:46:20,785 --> 00:46:22,787
Do not swear at all.

631
00:46:22,787 --> 00:46:27,209
Or if thou wilt...

632
00:46:27,293 --> 00:46:29,212
Swear by thy gracious self,

633
00:46:29,296 --> 00:46:32,216
which is the god
of my idolatry,

634
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:34,678
and I'll believe thee.

635
00:46:34,803 --> 00:46:39,809
If my heart's dear love,
I swear...

636
00:46:39,893 --> 00:46:41,686
Oh, Juliet!

637
00:46:57,791 --> 00:47:01,212
Sweet, good night.

638
00:47:01,295 --> 00:47:04,716
This bud of love
by summer's ripening breath

639
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,721
may prove a beauteous flower
when next we meet.

640
00:47:15,313 --> 00:47:19,902
Good night, good night.

641
00:47:19,902 --> 00:47:23,406
As sweet repose and rest
come to thy heart

642
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:26,410
as that
within my breast.

643
00:47:32,293 --> 00:47:34,796
O, wilt thou leave me
so unsatisfied?

644
00:47:36,298 --> 00:47:39,593
What satisfaction
canst thou have tonight?

645
00:47:39,719 --> 00:47:43,515
Th' exchange of thy love's
faithful vow for mine.

646
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:45,226
Ahh.

647
00:47:54,822 --> 00:47:58,701
I gave thee mine before
thou didst request it.

648
00:47:58,827 --> 00:48:01,538
And yet I would it were
to give again.

649
00:48:04,209 --> 00:48:06,211
Wouldst thou
withdraw it?

650
00:48:06,337 --> 00:48:08,506
For what purpose, love?

651
00:48:08,631 --> 00:48:13,512
But to be frank
and give it thee again.

652
00:48:17,142 --> 00:48:23,233
And yet I wish
but for the thing I have,

653
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:26,237
my bounty is
as boundless as the sea,

654
00:48:26,321 --> 00:48:27,739
my love as deep.

655
00:48:27,823 --> 00:48:30,743
The more I give to thee,
the more I have,

656
00:48:30,827 --> 00:48:32,746
for both are infinite.

657
00:48:32,829 --> 00:48:34,247
Juliet!

658
00:48:34,331 --> 00:48:35,749
Anon, good nurse!

659
00:48:35,833 --> 00:48:39,212
Sweet Montague, be true.

660
00:48:39,337 --> 00:48:41,715
Madam!

661
00:48:41,841 --> 00:48:44,719
Stay but a little,
I will come again.

662
00:48:44,845 --> 00:48:47,223
Madam! Lady Juliet!

663
00:48:55,316 --> 00:48:57,944
O blessed, blessed night!

664
00:48:59,655 --> 00:49:02,533
Oh! I am afeard,
being in night,

665
00:49:02,659 --> 00:49:04,745
all this is but a dream,

666
00:49:04,745 --> 00:49:07,248
too flattering-sweet
to be substantial.

667
00:49:07,248 --> 00:49:11,253
Three words, dear Romeo,
and good night indeed.

668
00:49:11,337 --> 00:49:14,257
If that thy bent of love
be honorable,

669
00:49:14,341 --> 00:49:16,760
thy purpose marriage,
send me word tomorrow,

670
00:49:16,844 --> 00:49:19,263
by one that I'll procure
to come to thee.

671
00:49:19,347 --> 00:49:22,225
Where and what time
thou wilt perform the rite,

672
00:49:22,351 --> 00:49:24,729
and all my fortunes
at thy foot I'll lay

673
00:49:24,854 --> 00:49:27,440
and follow thee, my lord,
throughout the world.

674
00:49:27,566 --> 00:49:28,734
Madam!

675
00:49:28,859 --> 00:49:31,862
I come, anon.

676
00:49:31,947 --> 00:49:35,242
But if thou meanest not well,
I do beseech thee--

677
00:49:35,368 --> 00:49:36,452
Lady Juliet!

678
00:49:36,452 --> 00:49:37,745
By and by I come!

679
00:49:37,829 --> 00:49:40,958
To cease thy suit
and leave me to my grief.

680
00:49:41,042 --> 00:49:42,460
Tomorrow will I send.

681
00:49:42,544 --> 00:49:45,172
So thrive my soul.

682
00:49:45,255 --> 00:49:47,841
A thousand times
good night!

683
00:49:51,639 --> 00:49:53,266
Romeo!

684
00:49:53,349 --> 00:49:56,060
At what o'clock tomorrow
shall I send to thee?

685
00:49:56,144 --> 00:49:57,270
At the hour of nine.

686
00:49:57,354 --> 00:49:59,273
I will not fail.

687
00:49:59,357 --> 00:50:01,568
'Tis twenty years
till then.

688
00:50:02,945 --> 00:50:03,862
Romeo!

689
00:50:12,373 --> 00:50:14,751
I have forgot
why I did call thee back.

690
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:18,256
Let me stand here
till thou remember it.

691
00:50:18,381 --> 00:50:21,843
I shall forget, to have
thee still stand there,

692
00:50:21,844 --> 00:50:23,053
remembering how
I love thy company.

693
00:50:23,179 --> 00:50:24,555
And I'll still stay,

694
00:50:24,681 --> 00:50:26,558
to have thee
still forget,

695
00:50:26,683 --> 00:50:29,561
forgetting
any other home but this.

696
00:50:29,646 --> 00:50:31,857
Ahh.

697
00:50:48,753 --> 00:50:51,172
<i>[rooster crowing]</i>

698
00:50:56,764 --> 00:50:59,684
Good night, good night!

699
00:50:59,768 --> 00:51:03,272
Parting is
such sweet sorrow

700
00:51:03,355 --> 00:51:06,484
that I shall say good night
till it be morrow.

701
00:51:47,704 --> 00:51:49,372
Woo!

702
00:52:15,490 --> 00:52:16,783
Woo!

703
00:53:07,223 --> 00:53:10,018
Friar Laurence!

704
00:53:10,101 --> 00:53:12,812
What early tongue
so sweet saluteth me?

705
00:53:12,897 --> 00:53:14,816
Good morrow, father!

706
00:53:14,899 --> 00:53:16,818
Ha ha ha!

707
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:19,321
Hey!

708
00:53:22,409 --> 00:53:25,120
Young son, it argues
a distempered head

709
00:53:25,204 --> 00:53:28,625
so soon to bid
good morrow to thy bed.

710
00:53:28,709 --> 00:53:30,711
Therefore thy earliness
doth me assure

711
00:53:30,836 --> 00:53:32,713
thou art uproused with
some distemperature.

712
00:53:32,839 --> 00:53:36,218
Or if not so,
then here I put it right

713
00:53:36,302 --> 00:53:38,721
our Romeo hath not
been in bed tonight.

714
00:53:38,805 --> 00:53:41,934
The last is true.
The sweeter rest was mine.

715
00:53:42,017 --> 00:53:44,228
God pardon sin!
Wast thou with Rosaline?

716
00:53:44,312 --> 00:53:46,731
With Rosaline,
my ghostly father, no.

717
00:53:46,815 --> 00:53:49,735
I have forgot that name
and that name's woe.

718
00:53:49,819 --> 00:53:51,237
That's my good son.

719
00:53:51,321 --> 00:53:53,240
Well, where hast
thou been then?

720
00:53:53,323 --> 00:53:55,742
I'll tell thee ere
thou ask it me again.

721
00:53:55,827 --> 00:53:58,205
I have been feasting
with mine enemy,

722
00:53:58,330 --> 00:54:00,624
where on a sudden
one hath wounded me.

723
00:54:00,708 --> 00:54:03,711
Be plain, good son,
and homely in thy drift.

724
00:54:03,712 --> 00:54:05,839
Riddling confession finds
but riddling shrift.

725
00:54:05,923 --> 00:54:09,719
Then plainly know
my heart's dear love is set,

726
00:54:09,719 --> 00:54:12,222
on the fair daughter
of rich Capulet.

727
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:15,727
As mine on hers,
so hers is set on mine,

728
00:54:15,727 --> 00:54:18,230
and all combined,
save what thou must combine

729
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:20,232
by holy marriage.

730
00:54:20,233 --> 00:54:22,235
When and where,
and how we met,

731
00:54:22,236 --> 00:54:24,739
we woo'd, and made
exchange of vow,

732
00:54:24,739 --> 00:54:26,115
I'll tell thee as we pass.

733
00:54:26,116 --> 00:54:27,743
But this I pray,

734
00:54:27,743 --> 00:54:30,037
that thou consent
to marry us today.

735
00:54:30,121 --> 00:54:32,248
Hmmm?

736
00:54:32,332 --> 00:54:34,418
Holy Saint Francis!

737
00:54:34,543 --> 00:54:36,754
Is Rosaline,
that thou didst love so dear,

738
00:54:36,838 --> 00:54:38,256
so soon forsaken?

739
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:40,217
Thou doest not mock me, Father!

740
00:54:40,342 --> 00:54:43,220
Young men's love then lies
not truly in their hearts,

741
00:54:43,346 --> 00:54:44,722
but in their eyes.

742
00:54:44,848 --> 00:54:46,224
Hear me, Father.

743
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:48,227
Jesu Maria!
What a deal of brine

744
00:54:48,352 --> 00:54:50,730
hath washed thy sallow cheeks
for Rosaline!

745
00:54:50,856 --> 00:54:52,232
And art thou changed?

746
00:54:52,357 --> 00:54:53,733
Pronounce this
sentence then.

747
00:54:53,859 --> 00:54:56,737
Women may fall when
there's no strength in men.

748
00:54:56,863 --> 00:54:59,241
Thou chidst me oft
for loving Rosaline.

749
00:54:59,325 --> 00:55:01,244
Doting, not for loving,
pupil mine.

750
00:55:01,327 --> 00:55:04,456
Yes, for loving and,
and badest me bury love.

751
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:07,460
Not in a grave
to lay one in,

752
00:55:07,544 --> 00:55:09,045
another out to have.

753
00:55:24,232 --> 00:55:26,735
Come, young waverer,

754
00:55:26,735 --> 00:55:29,238
come, go with me.

755
00:55:29,238 --> 00:55:33,243
In one respect
I'll thy assistant be.

756
00:55:33,243 --> 00:55:34,744
O Father!

757
00:55:36,164 --> 00:55:38,750
For this alliance
may so happy prove

758
00:55:38,875 --> 00:55:41,253
to turn your households'
rancor to pure love.

759
00:55:41,337 --> 00:55:42,755
O, let us hence!

760
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,758
I stand on sudden haste.

761
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:46,259
Shh! Wisely and slow,

762
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:49,263
they stumble
that run fast.

763
00:55:49,347 --> 00:55:50,765
Ha ha ha!

764
00:55:50,849 --> 00:55:52,267
Shh!

765
00:55:56,356 --> 00:55:58,775
Where the devil
should this Romeo be?

766
00:55:58,859 --> 00:56:00,277
Hmm?

767
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:03,657
Came he not home tonight?

768
00:56:03,782 --> 00:56:06,160
Hmm?

769
00:56:06,244 --> 00:56:07,662
Huh?

770
00:56:07,746 --> 00:56:09,665
Came he not home tonight?

771
00:56:09,748 --> 00:56:10,665
Who?

772
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:11,876
Romeo.

773
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:15,673
O no, not to his father's.
I spoke with his man.

774
00:56:15,756 --> 00:56:18,259
Hey, Tybalt, the kinsman
to old Capulet,

775
00:56:18,259 --> 00:56:21,262
hath sent a letter
to his father's house.

776
00:56:22,765 --> 00:56:24,767
A challenge, on my life.

777
00:56:24,768 --> 00:56:26,269
Romeo will answer it.

778
00:56:26,270 --> 00:56:29,273
Any man that can write
may answer a letter.

779
00:56:29,273 --> 00:56:32,276
Nay, he will answer
the letter's master,

780
00:56:32,277 --> 00:56:34,279
how he dares,
being dared.

781
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:36,783
Alas, poor Romeo,
he is already dead;

782
00:56:36,783 --> 00:56:39,286
stabbed with
a white wench's black eye;

783
00:56:39,286 --> 00:56:42,289
run through the ear
with a love song;

784
00:56:42,290 --> 00:56:45,293
the very pin
of his heart cleft

785
00:56:45,377 --> 00:56:48,255
with the blind
bow-boy's buttshaft.

786
00:56:50,592 --> 00:56:53,262
And is he a man
to encounter Tybalt?

787
00:56:53,263 --> 00:56:56,183
Why, what is Tybalt!

788
00:56:56,183 --> 00:56:59,979
More than Prince of Cats,
I can tell you.

789
00:57:05,487 --> 00:57:07,072
Ah, good morrow
to you both.

790
00:57:10,284 --> 00:57:12,161
<i>[sniff]</i>

791
00:57:12,287 --> 00:57:14,665
That we should be
thus afflicted

792
00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:17,168
with these
strange flies,

793
00:57:17,293 --> 00:57:19,295
these fashionmongers,

794
00:57:19,296 --> 00:57:22,800
these pardonnez moi's.

795
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,301
Ah, Signor Romeo,

796
00:57:24,302 --> 00:57:25,803
Bonjour.

797
00:57:25,804 --> 00:57:27,305
Bonjour.

798
00:57:27,306 --> 00:57:29,767
There's a French salutation
to your French slop.

799
00:57:29,768 --> 00:57:31,269
Huh?

800
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:33,773
You gave us the counterfeit
fairly last night.

801
00:57:33,773 --> 00:57:35,775
What counterfeit
did I give you?

802
00:57:35,775 --> 00:57:37,777
The slip, sir, the slip,

803
00:57:37,778 --> 00:57:39,196
can you not conceive?

804
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,573
Pardon, good Mercutio.

805
00:57:40,698 --> 00:57:41,991
My business was great--

806
00:57:42,075 --> 00:57:43,284
Oh! Ha ha ha!

807
00:57:43,285 --> 00:57:45,287
In such a case as mine

808
00:57:45,288 --> 00:57:46,789
a man may strain courtesy.

809
00:57:46,790 --> 00:57:48,291
Come between us,
good Benvolio;

810
00:57:48,291 --> 00:57:49,792
my wit faints.

811
00:57:49,877 --> 00:57:51,796
Thy wit is
very bitter sweeting

812
00:57:51,879 --> 00:57:53,297
it is most sharp sauce.

813
00:57:53,381 --> 00:57:55,300
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

814
00:57:55,384 --> 00:57:56,802
Ha ha ha!

815
00:57:56,886 --> 00:57:58,805
Why, is not this
better now

816
00:57:58,888 --> 00:58:01,015
than groaning for love?

817
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:03,686
Now art thou sociable,

818
00:58:03,811 --> 00:58:05,688
now art thou Romeo;

819
00:58:05,814 --> 00:58:08,192
now art thou
what thou art,

820
00:58:08,317 --> 00:58:11,195
by art as well as
by nature.

821
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:13,698
For this driveling love
is like a great natural

822
00:58:13,782 --> 00:58:15,200
that runs malling
up and down

823
00:58:15,284 --> 00:58:17,203
to hide his bauble
in a hole.

824
00:58:17,287 --> 00:58:18,705
Stop there,
stop there.

825
00:58:18,789 --> 00:58:21,709
Thou desirest me to stop
in my tale against the hair?

826
00:58:21,793 --> 00:58:23,712
Thou wouldst else
have made thy tale large.

827
00:58:23,795 --> 00:58:25,296
No, no, no,
thou art deceived;

828
00:58:25,297 --> 00:58:28,801
For I was come to
the whole depth of my tale,

829
00:58:28,802 --> 00:58:30,888
and meant to occupy
the argument no longer.

830
00:58:36,311 --> 00:58:37,687
Here's goodly gear.

831
00:58:37,813 --> 00:58:39,189
<i>[laughter]</i>

832
00:58:39,315 --> 00:58:42,026
Here's a fine barge.

833
00:58:42,110 --> 00:58:43,194
A sail.

Anon.

841
00:59:01,719 --> 00:59:03,805
My fan, Peter.

842
00:59:03,930 --> 00:59:05,431
Good, Peter,
to hide her face,

843
00:59:05,432 --> 00:59:07,601
for her fan's
the fairer of the two.

844

Is it good den,

Well, 'tis no less

Ha ha ha! Oh!

Out upon you,

00:59:29,922 --> 00:59:33,718
One, gentlewoman, that God
hath made himself to mar.

01:01:32,162 --> 01:01:34,039
than he will stand to
in a month.

901
01:01:34,164 --> 01:01:35,373
I'll take him down,

902
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:37,377
an 'a were lustier
than he is,

903
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:38,669
and twenty such jacks;

904
01:01:38,754 --> 01:01:42,175
and if I cannot,
I'll find those that shall.

905
01:01:42,258 --> 01:01:44,260
Ha ha ha!

906
01:01:45,345 --> 01:01:49,266
Ha ha ha!

907
01:01:49,267 --> 01:01:53,772
And thou must
stand by too

908
01:01:53,773 --> 01:01:56,151
and suffer every knave

909
01:01:56,276 --> 01:01:58,946
to use me
at his pleasure.

910
01:01:59,071 --> 01:02:02,658
Ooh...

911
01:02:02,784 --> 01:02:05,662
Punk rampant!

912
01:02:05,788 --> 01:02:08,666
Pray you, sir,
a word.

913
01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:10,085
Ooh!

914
01:02:15,259 --> 01:02:17,178
Beef wit.

915
01:02:17,261 --> 01:02:21,182
<i>[organ playing]</i>

916
01:02:38,288 --> 01:02:40,791
<i>[choir singing]</i>

917
01:02:59,774 --> 01:03:03,695
My young lady bid me
inquire you out.

918
01:03:03,779 --> 01:03:06,198
What she did
bid me say,

919
01:03:06,283 --> 01:03:08,202
I will keep to myself;,

920
01:03:08,285 --> 01:03:10,704
but first
let me tell ye,

921
01:03:10,788 --> 01:03:14,167
if ye should lead her
in a fool's paradise--

922
01:03:14,293 --> 01:03:15,669
Nurse.

923
01:03:15,795 --> 01:03:17,171
Shh! As they say,

924
01:03:17,297 --> 01:03:19,675
it were a very gross
kind of behavior;,

925
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,176
for the gentlewoman
is young;

926
01:03:21,302 --> 01:03:23,680
and therefore if you
should deal double with her,

927
01:03:23,805 --> 01:03:27,184
it were an ill thing to be
offered to any gentlewoman,

928
01:03:27,310 --> 01:03:28,686
and very
weak dealing.

929
01:03:28,811 --> 01:03:32,190
Nurse, commend me
to thy lady and mistress,

930
01:03:32,274 --> 01:03:34,276
I protest unto thee.

931
01:03:34,402 --> 01:03:35,778
Bid her devise,

932
01:03:35,904 --> 01:03:39,283
some means to come to
shrift this afternoon,

933
01:03:39,283 --> 01:03:43,288
and there she shall
at Friar Laurence's cell

934
01:03:43,288 --> 01:03:47,501
be shrived and married.

935
01:03:47,502 --> 01:03:49,796
Oh!

936
01:03:49,797 --> 01:03:51,298
Oh!

937
01:03:52,801 --> 01:03:54,302
Here's for thy pains.

938
01:03:54,386 --> 01:03:57,306
No, no truly, sir,
not a penny.

939
01:03:57,306 --> 01:03:59,308
Go to,
I say you shall.

940
01:03:59,309 --> 01:04:00,393
No.

941
01:04:00,519 --> 01:04:02,187
Well...

942
01:04:05,817 --> 01:04:08,820
Sir, my mistress
is the sweetest lady.

943
01:04:08,905 --> 01:04:11,700
Lord, Lord, when she were
a little prating thing.

944
01:04:11,825 --> 01:04:13,201
Good-bye. Oh!

945
01:04:13,285 --> 01:04:15,204
O there is
a noble man in town,

946
01:04:15,288 --> 01:04:17,207
One Paris, that would fain
lay knife aboard.

947
01:04:17,290 --> 01:04:21,211
I anger her sometimes and say
that Paris is the properer man.

948
01:04:21,295 --> 01:04:23,714
Nurse, commend me
to thy lady.

949
01:04:23,799 --> 01:04:25,217
A thousand times.

950
01:04:25,301 --> 01:04:28,096
Ooh! Ooh!

951
01:04:52,836 --> 01:04:54,296
<i>[sighs]</i>

952
01:04:54,296 --> 01:04:58,301
The clock struck nine
when I did send the nurse,

953
01:04:58,301 --> 01:05:02,222
in half an hour
she promised to return...

954
01:05:02,306 --> 01:05:04,725
perchance
she cannot meet him;

955
01:05:04,810 --> 01:05:06,729
ahh, that's not so,

956
01:05:06,812 --> 01:05:08,731
oh, she's lame,

957
01:05:08,815 --> 01:05:11,234
love's heralds
should be thoughts!

958
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:15,239
Had she affections
and warm youthful blood,

959
01:05:15,323 --> 01:05:17,742
she would be
as swift in motion

960
01:05:17,826 --> 01:05:19,244
as a ball.

961
01:05:19,328 --> 01:05:23,207
But old folks,
many feign as they were dead,

962
01:05:23,333 --> 01:05:27,212
unwieldy, slow, heavy...

963
01:05:27,338 --> 01:05:29,924
And pale as lead.

964
01:05:33,847 --> 01:05:35,223
O God, she comes.

965
01:05:35,349 --> 01:05:36,725
O honey nurse,
what news?

966
01:05:36,725 --> 01:05:39,728
O Lord, why look'st
thou sad?

967
01:05:39,813 --> 01:05:41,231
Oh!

968
01:05:41,315 --> 01:05:42,733
Though news be sad,

969
01:05:42,817 --> 01:05:44,235
yet tell
them merrily.

970
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:45,737
<i>[groaning]</i>

971
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:47,238
Send the man away.

972
01:05:47,322 --> 01:05:50,325
Peter, stay at the gate.

973
01:05:50,326 --> 01:05:52,829
Go on.

974
01:05:52,829 --> 01:05:54,831
Hast thou met
with him?

975
01:05:54,832 --> 01:05:56,333
Oh, I am aweary.

976
01:05:56,334 --> 01:05:57,835
Give me leave awhile.

977
01:05:57,836 --> 01:05:59,838
Fie, how my bones ache!

978
01:05:59,838 --> 01:06:02,216
Ooh!

Sweet, sweet...

01:06:07,223 --> 01:06:09,142
Sweet nurse.

982
01:06:09,226 --> 01:06:11,645
Tell me, what says my love?

983
01:06:11,729 --> 01:06:13,648
Ha ha ha!

984
01:06:13,731 --> 01:06:17,652
Your love says like
an honest gentleman,

985
01:06:17,736 --> 01:06:22,658
and courteous,
and kind,

986
01:06:22,743 --> 01:06:25,663
and handsome,
and, I warrant him,

987
01:06:25,747 --> 01:06:27,624
a virtuous--

988
01:06:27,749 --> 01:06:29,125
Where is your mother?

989
01:06:29,251 --> 01:06:30,627
Where is my mother?

990
01:06:30,753 --> 01:06:32,129
Why, she is within.

991
01:06:32,255 --> 01:06:33,631
Where should she be?

992
01:06:33,757 --> 01:06:35,133
How oddly thou repliest!

993
01:06:35,259 --> 01:06:37,637
"Your love says like
an honest gentleman,

994
01:06:37,762 --> 01:06:38,638
where is your mother?"

995
01:06:38,763 --> 01:06:41,266
Oh, God's lady,
are you so hot?

996
01:06:41,267 --> 01:06:42,768
Marry, come up I trow.

997
01:06:42,769 --> 01:06:45,230
Is this the poultice
for my aching bones?

998
01:06:45,230 --> 01:06:46,731
Henceforward do
your messages yourself.

999
01:06:46,732 --> 01:06:48,233
Here's such a coil!

1000
01:06:48,234 --> 01:06:51,070
Come! What says Romeo?

1001
01:06:54,242 --> 01:06:57,746
Have you got leave
to go to shrift today?

1002
01:06:57,746 --> 01:06:59,247
I have.

1003
01:06:59,248 --> 01:07:00,749
<i>[chuckling]</i>

1004
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:04,254
Then, hie you hence
to Friar Laurence's cell,

1005
01:07:04,254 --> 01:07:08,759
there stays a husband
to make you a wife.

1006
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:11,346
Ha ha ha!

1007
01:07:11,472 --> 01:07:15,769
Now comes the wanton blood
up in your cheeks.

1008
01:07:15,853 --> 01:07:18,856
They'll be in scarlet
straight at any news.

1009
01:07:20,442 --> 01:07:22,277
Hie you to church!

1010
01:07:22,361 --> 01:07:24,447
I'll to dinner.

1011
01:07:24,447 --> 01:07:27,242
Honest nurse, farewell!

1012
01:07:27,367 --> 01:07:29,661
Ha ha ha!

1013
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:40,258
So smile the heavens
upon this holy act,

1014
01:07:40,384 --> 01:07:43,262
that after-hours with sorrow
chide us not.

1015
01:07:43,346 --> 01:07:46,266
Amen, amen.

1016
01:07:46,350 --> 01:07:47,768
Come what sorrow can,

1017
01:07:47,852 --> 01:07:50,271
it cannot countervail
the exchange of joy

1018
01:07:50,355 --> 01:07:53,275
that one short minute
gives me in her sight.

1019
01:07:53,359 --> 01:07:55,278
These violent delights
have violent ends,

1020
01:07:55,362 --> 01:07:56,780
and in
their triumph die,

1021
01:07:56,864 --> 01:07:58,282
like fire and powder,

1022
01:07:58,365 --> 01:08:00,284
which as
they kiss consume.

1023
01:08:00,285 --> 01:08:02,287
The sweetest honey
is loathsome

1024
01:08:02,287 --> 01:08:03,788
in its own...

1025
01:08:03,789 --> 01:08:05,290
Deliciousness.

1026
01:08:05,291 --> 01:08:06,792
Deliciousness.

1027
01:08:06,793 --> 01:08:08,753
And in the taste
confounds the...

1028
01:08:08,754 --> 01:08:10,089
Appetite.

1029
01:08:10,172 --> 01:08:11,381
Appetite.

1030
01:08:11,466 --> 01:08:15,262
Therefore
love moderately...

1031
01:08:15,262 --> 01:08:17,765
Long love doth so.

1032
01:08:17,891 --> 01:08:20,686
Ah, here comes
the lady.

1033
01:08:20,769 --> 01:08:23,898
O, so light a foot will ne'er
wear out the everlasting flint.

1034
01:08:23,982 --> 01:08:25,775
Juliet!

1035
01:08:30,365 --> 01:08:32,784
Good even to
my ghostly confessor.

1036
01:08:32,868 --> 01:08:36,289
Romeo shall thank thee,
daughter, for us both.

1037
01:08:36,373 --> 01:08:37,791
Ah, Juliet,

1038
01:08:37,874 --> 01:08:41,003
if the measure of thy joy
be heaped like mine,

1039
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:43,798
that thy skill be
more to blazon it,

1040
01:08:43,882 --> 01:08:45,300
then sweeten
with thy breath

1041
01:08:45,384 --> 01:08:46,802
this neighbor air.

1042
01:08:46,886 --> 01:08:49,764
They are but beggars
that can count their worth.

1043
01:08:49,890 --> 01:08:53,269
But my true love is
grown to such excess,

1044
01:08:53,269 --> 01:08:55,772
I cannot sum up
sum of half my wealth.

1045
01:08:55,898 --> 01:08:57,274
Tsk tsk tsk!

1046
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:59,986
Come, come with me...

1047
01:09:00,070 --> 01:09:01,905
We will make short work.

1048
01:09:01,989 --> 01:09:03,407
For, by your leaves,

1049
01:09:03,491 --> 01:09:05,410
you shall not
stay alone

1050
01:09:05,493 --> 01:09:08,788
till holy church
incorporate two in one.
