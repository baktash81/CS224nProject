1
00:01:22,651 --> 00:01:23,861
Ash, where are we?

2
00:01:23,861 --> 00:01:26,238
We've just crossed the Tenessee
border.

3
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:35,124
- Which will put us...
- Yeah?

4
00:01:41,047 --> 00:01:42,966
Which will put us...

5
00:01:50,975 --> 00:01:52,268
Here.

6
00:02:00,986 --> 00:02:03,072
What the hell was that?!
Were you trying to kill us?!

7
00:02:03,072 --> 00:02:07,369
Hey, don't blame me! Just steering wheel!
Damn thing jerked right out of my hand!

8
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:10,956
I don't understand. I had to
sing it for tune up yesterday
and they said they go for everything!

9
00:02:10,956 --> 00:02:13,459
Well, you'd better take it back,
cause' the damn thing does not work!

10
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:16,838
The only thing which does work,
it is this lousy horn!

11
00:02:19,842 --> 00:02:22,177
Go to hell!
I am not hooting at you.

12
00:02:25,681 --> 00:02:26,975
Jesus Christ!

13
00:02:27,684 --> 00:02:30,061
Hey Scotty,
what's this place like, anyway?

14
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:33,648
Well, the guy that rented it said that it
is an old place.

15
00:02:33,648 --> 00:02:36,652
Little rundown, but it is
right up in the mountains.

16
00:02:37,361 --> 00:02:39,363
The best part is, we get it so cheap.

17
00:02:39,363 --> 00:02:41,157
And why we're getting it so cheap?

18
00:02:42,492 --> 00:02:44,870
Well, I don't know,
it might be in a real bad shape.

19
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,497
You mean nobody've seen this place yet?

20
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:50,168
- Not yet.
- It might not be that bad.

21
00:02:50,626 --> 00:02:53,046
- No.
- Actually it might be kinda nice.

22
00:02:53,629 --> 00:02:56,759
- Yeah.
- It's probably a real peat.

23
00:02:57,968 --> 00:02:59,845
I think this is where we get off.

24
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:09,481
- This is the bridge we gonna cross?!
- Jesus Christ! All thing fall apart.

25
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:15,363
Don't let your eyes fool you,
girls. This thing is solid as a rock.

26
00:05:29,807 --> 00:05:32,101
This suppouse to be one of
these aren't here.

27
00:07:58,892 --> 00:08:00,394
Come with us!

28
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:26,742
Will you stop it!

29
00:09:27,535 --> 00:09:32,039
I would like very much to make a toast here
for all this evening.

30
00:09:35,836 --> 00:09:38,422
As a great friend of mine once said...

31
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,342
He said...

32
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:48,391
Ok, ok, ok...

33
00:09:54,022 --> 00:09:55,607
Which means?

34
00:09:55,607 --> 00:09:57,402
Pour it down.

35
00:10:20,136 --> 00:10:21,262
What is this?

36
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,557
Whatever it is, it's still down there.

37
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:28,604
I do't like cellars.
Let's just close it up.

38
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,523
It's probably just some animal.

39
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,610
An animal?!
An animal?!

40
00:10:36,821 --> 00:10:39,240
That is the stupidest thing I've ever
heard of! Jesus Christ!

41
00:10:40,909 --> 00:10:43,037
But there is something down there.

42
00:10:46,248 --> 00:10:48,250
Maybe this's just some animal.

43
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:51,630
Yeah, you're probably right.
Probably some animal.

44
00:10:52,214 --> 00:10:54,341
Here, Sharon,
won't you go down check make sure?

45
00:10:54,341 --> 00:10:56,427
Scotty, I'm not going down there.

46
00:10:57,053 --> 00:10:59,639
Ok, ok, you cowards. I'll go.

47
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:00,640
Be careful.

48
00:11:06,939 --> 00:11:07,940
Back in a minute.

49
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,717
Hey, Scotty you find anything?

50
00:11:35,638 --> 00:11:36,347
Scotty!?

51
00:11:41,353 --> 00:11:42,563
Scotty!?

52
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,070
Scott!

53
00:11:53,116 --> 00:11:55,118
He's just kidding around.

54
00:11:57,037 --> 00:11:59,540
Isn't he?

55
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:05,046
Give me a flashlight.

56
00:12:05,547 --> 00:12:07,048
That's the only on we brought up!

57
00:12:07,048 --> 00:12:08,425
And get the lantern.

58
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,432
Scotty!?

59
00:14:49,066 --> 00:14:50,734
Come here, I wanna show you something.

60
00:14:53,737 --> 00:14:55,072
Look at all this stuff.

61
00:15:06,168 --> 00:15:07,461
I bet this still shoots.

62
00:15:07,461 --> 00:15:09,088
Probably, it is.

63
00:15:21,352 --> 00:15:22,562
Oh, God!

64
00:15:23,062 --> 00:15:24,147
Look at this.

65
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,751
Look at this...

66
00:15:53,096 --> 00:15:55,765
This skull looks like
your old girlfriend.

67
00:15:59,604 --> 00:16:03,149
Come on, let's take this stuff upstairs.
I'll grab the recorder...

68
00:16:03,149 --> 00:16:05,360
and you get everything else.

69
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:21,670
This guy was a real turk, you know,
everybody hated him.

70
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:23,255
Like you.

71
00:16:23,881 --> 00:16:26,092
Yes, just like me.
I am gonna grade your face.

72
00:16:26,176 --> 00:16:30,388
He has also invented this western stuff...

73
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,477
Listen to this.

74
00:16:35,478 --> 00:16:37,480
This is the tape I found downstairs.

75
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:46,073
It is been a number of years since I began
exhumating the ruins of Candar
with a group of my colegues.

76
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:51,955
Now my wife and I have retreated to a small
cabin, in the solitude of these mountains.

77
00:16:52,664 --> 00:16:55,583
Here I continued my research
undisturbed by

78
00:16:55,876 --> 00:17:00,464
the distractions of modern civilization
and far from the grows of academy.

79
00:17:01,674 --> 00:17:06,304
I believe I have made a significant
find in the Candarian ruins.

80
00:17:06,888 --> 00:17:11,811
Of army of ancient Sumerian
burial practises and funerary incantations.

81
00:17:12,478 --> 00:17:15,398
It is entitled "Naturam Demontum"

82
00:17:15,398 --> 00:17:18,402
Roughtly translated
"Book of the Dead".

83
00:17:18,402 --> 00:17:20,904
The book is bound in human flesh

84
00:17:20,904 --> 00:17:22,990
and ink in human blood.

85
00:17:25,325 --> 00:17:28,746
It deals with demons, demon
resurrection, and those forces which

86
00:17:28,788 --> 00:17:33,168
wrong the forest and
dark powers of man's domain.

87
00:17:33,878 --> 00:17:37,173
The first few pages warn that these
enduring creatures may lie

88
00:17:37,173 --> 00:17:41,469
dormant, but they're never truly dead.
They may be recalled to active life

89
00:17:41,469 --> 00:17:46,474
throught the incantations
presented in this book.

90
00:17:46,683 --> 00:17:48,603
It is true recitation of these passages

91
00:17:48,603 --> 00:17:52,190
when the demons are given licence
to posses the living.

92
00:17:54,484 --> 00:17:56,695
Hey, what did you do that for?
It was just getting good.

93
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,489
I just don't want to hear
that anymore, that's all.

94
00:18:02,326 --> 00:18:05,705
Scott, come on.

95
00:18:05,705 --> 00:18:09,876
Hey come on I just wann hear the rest of it.
No big deal.

96
00:18:30,483 --> 00:18:31,818
Shut it off!

97
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:37,199
Shut it off!

98
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,995
Shut it off!

99
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:42,622
Oh my God!

100
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:50,589
Sharon, where are you going?

101
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:51,590
I can't believe this!

102
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:55,386
Scott, you know not to you play that!
Come on, you knew it was upsetting!

103
00:18:55,386 --> 00:18:58,098
You just don't know when you've
taken something too far!

104
00:18:58,098 --> 00:19:01,393
Hey, don't give me that! You were playing that too!
You could have shut it off!

105
00:19:01,685 --> 00:19:02,978
A big deal! She is nutts!

106
00:19:03,479 --> 00:19:07,400
It's just a joke, come on!

107
00:19:08,901 --> 00:19:11,905
She acts like she's 3 years old or something.

108
00:19:26,422 --> 00:19:30,301
Listen, why don't we stay up
for a while undisturbant?.

109
00:19:30,342 --> 00:19:34,598
All right! I will check up on
Sharon to make sure she's ok.

110
00:20:41,131 --> 00:20:43,509
Stealing from the blind, huh?

111
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:48,515
Here.

112
00:21:00,486 --> 00:21:02,321
Ash, how sweat of you!

113
00:21:05,701 --> 00:21:07,119
- Would you put that...
- Oh, sure.

114
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,834
I was going to give it to you
before we come up here here, but...

115
00:21:13,418 --> 00:21:18,507
The things got hacketed and this is
really the first chance we can be alone.

116
00:21:22,344 --> 00:21:23,637
Take a look!

117
00:21:27,142 --> 00:21:34,150
Oh? Ash! Beautiful! I really love it!
I'll never tak it off.

118
00:22:32,131 --> 00:22:33,717
Join us!

119
00:23:09,924 --> 00:23:11,927
Is anybody out there?

120
00:24:14,164 --> 00:24:15,832
I know someone's out there!

121
00:24:21,965 --> 00:24:26,011
I heard you.
I heard you in the cellar.

122
00:28:31,998 --> 00:28:32,958
Ashley!

123
00:28:39,965 --> 00:28:41,175
Help!

124
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,081
Help!

125
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:35,862
What happened to you?
What's the matter with you?

126
00:29:35,904 --> 00:29:37,697
Did something in the woods did this to you?

127
00:29:37,781 --> 00:29:43,579
Not! It was woods themselves!
They're alive!

128
00:29:43,579 --> 00:29:46,374
Ash, what if I take her in the bedroom,
so she can lay down.

129
00:29:46,374 --> 00:29:49,711
No, I don't wanna lay down!
I wanna get out of here!

130
00:29:49,711 --> 00:29:53,090
I wanna leave this place right now.
Right now, Ashley.

131
00:29:53,215 --> 00:29:54,216
Wait a minute!

132
00:29:54,216 --> 00:29:56,261
I am not leaving in any place.

133
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:57,262
- Sharon.
- Sharon.

134
00:29:57,553 --> 00:29:59,847
Sharon, there is nothing here.
Trees do not attack people.

135
00:29:59,847 --> 00:30:02,767
Ashley, will you drive me in the town, or not?

136
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:07,856
Right now?! Look, sure, sure! I'll take in the town,
but just listen to what you're saying.

137
00:30:08,065 --> 00:30:12,279
I don't care, how it sounds!
I wanna get out of this place, right now!

138
00:30:13,863 --> 00:30:16,366
Ok, you can stay somewhere in town, then.

139
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:29,991
I know it's not gonna start.
It's not gonna let us leave.

140
00:32:24,511 --> 00:32:26,306
Why're you stopping?

141
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:29,517
Wait here a minute.

142
00:32:40,237 --> 00:32:41,781
Do you see something?

143
00:32:45,368 --> 00:32:46,870
Where're you going?

144
00:32:50,875 --> 00:32:51,792
Ashley!

145
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:05,600
Ashley!

146
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:13,093
It's not gonna let us go!
It's not gonna let us go, I told you!

147
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:17,514
It's not gonna let us go!

148
00:34:32,323 --> 00:34:36,536
I know now that my wife have become
the host to the Candarian demon.

149
00:34:36,536 --> 00:34:40,040
I fear that the only way to
stop those possessed by

150
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:44,128
the spirits of the book is subjectively
bodily dismemberment.

151
00:34:44,754 --> 00:34:49,301
I believe not to avoid this horror,
but for myself I have seen the dark shadows

152
00:34:49,301 --> 00:34:58,311
moving in the woods, and I have no doubt
that whatever I have ressurected throught
this book is sure to come calling... for me

153
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,730
Ok. Let me think.

154
00:35:01,939 --> 00:35:03,025
Is it seven?

155
00:35:03,025 --> 00:35:04,318
What suit?

156
00:35:04,526 --> 00:35:07,237
Diamonds... No, no, no wait!
Hearts.

157
00:35:07,237 --> 00:35:12,035
- Oh my God! Seven of hearts! You're right!
- Ash, I guessed the card right.

158
00:35:12,535 --> 00:35:14,454
Yeah, trully amazing...

159
00:35:14,537 --> 00:35:19,251
I do not know. I do not know.
But I think it's some sort of

160
00:35:19,251 --> 00:35:20,544
- an extrasensor something, like ESP.
- OK. Try this one!

161
00:35:20,836 --> 00:35:21,921
I don't believe it!

162
00:35:21,963 --> 00:35:23,839
Queen of spades.

163
00:35:24,131 --> 00:35:27,344
Queen of spades.

164
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:32,099
Four of hearts.

165
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:35,228
Eight of spades.
Two of spade.

166
00:35:35,436 --> 00:35:39,941
Eight of spade.
Two of spade.

167
00:35:42,528 --> 00:35:46,323
Why have you disturbed our sleep

168
00:35:46,448 --> 00:35:54,124
waking us from our ancient slumber?
You will die! Like the others before you.

169
00:35:54,624 --> 00:35:57,962
One by one we will thank you!

170
00:36:10,977 --> 00:36:12,437
What happened to her?

171
00:36:23,032 --> 00:36:27,454
Did you see her eyes! Ash, I'm scared,
what's wrong with her?

172
00:37:18,845 --> 00:37:20,347
Sharon, stop it!

173
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:22,360
Ash, I believe we ought to get out of here!

174
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,573
Yeah. These are the few more
hours before the morning.

175
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:29,493
I don't think I can wait that long!

176
00:39:30,077 --> 00:39:32,664
You have to, we all have to!

177
00:39:33,081 --> 00:39:38,586
And than in the morning we'll get in the car,
and take the bridge, and...

178
00:39:42,133 --> 00:39:45,136
Why she keep making those
horrible noises?

179
00:39:45,136 --> 00:39:46,345
I don't know.

180
00:39:48,265 --> 00:39:49,641
Look at her eyes!

181
00:39:54,479 --> 00:39:59,068
For God's sake what happend to her eyes?

182
00:40:13,668 --> 00:40:15,295
Everything's gonna be all right!

183
00:40:34,859 --> 00:40:37,779
Scott, I think there is
something out there.

184
00:40:46,789 --> 00:40:50,168
Go to bed and get some sleep, ok?

185
00:42:40,168 --> 00:42:41,002
Shelly?

186
00:43:52,499 --> 00:43:59,007
Thank you, I do not know what we'd have done
if we had to remain on those hot embers...

187
00:43:59,007 --> 00:44:05,181
burning my pretty flesh.
You have pretty skin.

188
00:44:23,201 --> 00:44:25,996

189
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:41,097

191
00:47:13,853 --> 00:47:15,020
Hit her!

192
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:17,399

193
00:48:10,918 --> 00:48:11,919

194
00:48:14,213 --> 00:48:15,214
Yeah?

195
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:20,220

196
00:48:23,932 --> 00:48:25,643
We gonna bury her.

197
00:48:27,228 --> 00:48:29,146
Shelly?

198
00:48:29,355 --> 00:48:31,524
- She's a friend of us!
- Ash, she's dead.

199
00:48:34,528 --> 00:48:35,946
Shelly is dead.

200
00:48:39,533 --> 00:48:41,202
We've to burry her now.

201
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:42,354
Linda is still sleaping.

202
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:44,732
- I thought...
- I'm getting out of here!

203
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,736
Scott, we can't take Linda
anywhere with a leg like that.

204
00:49:47,944 --> 00:49:50,864
We don't even know if there is another way
back besides the bridge.

205
00:49:51,239 --> 00:49:55,244
Maybe there's a hicking tram...
or an old road or a some way around the clif.

206
00:49:56,245 --> 00:49:59,540
I mean there's gotta be another
way besides the bridge.

207
00:49:59,957 --> 00:50:04,421
Listen to me. Linda cannot walk
with the leg like that.
She can't even stand up.

208
00:50:05,631 --> 00:50:08,717
Well then, we'll leave her here.
untill we can send somebody back.

209
00:50:08,717 --> 00:50:11,930
- What are you, crazy?
- Look, I'm getting out!

210
00:50:13,139 --> 00:50:17,520
I don't care what happens to her.
She's your girlfriend, you take care of her.

211
00:50:18,145 --> 00:50:20,940
I'm getting the hell out of here, right now!

212
00:50:40,671 --> 00:50:44,258
Soon, all you'll be like me.

213
00:50:44,258 --> 00:50:47,137
And than I will lock you up in the cellar!

214
00:51:42,741 --> 00:51:45,243
- Oh my God!
- Help me!

215
00:51:57,382 --> 00:52:02,555
Scotty, you're gonna be ok,
You're gonna be just fine. You'll see.

216
00:52:14,735 --> 00:52:17,447
Ash, it's not gonna let us leave.

217
00:52:17,948 --> 00:52:21,159
Sharon was right.

218
00:52:22,661 --> 00:52:23,870
We all're gonna die here.

219
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:25,456
No, we're not gonna die.

220
00:52:25,456 --> 00:52:27,875
Well, I'm gonna die.
All of us.

221
00:52:29,043 --> 00:52:33,257
No, we're not gonna die. We're not gonna die.
We'll get out of here!

222
00:52:34,049 --> 00:52:36,260
Now listen to me Scotty.

223
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:38,679
Is there a way around the bridge?

224
00:52:39,764 --> 00:52:43,977
Scotty, listen to me, please!
For God's sake!

225
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:52,945
Ash, I don't wanna die!
You're not gonna leave me, are you, Ash?

226
00:52:54,155 --> 00:52:59,369
I don't wanna die.
You're not gonna leave me, are you, Ash?

227
00:53:02,957 --> 00:53:05,668
Scotty, come on, listen to me!
For God sake!

228
00:53:05,668 --> 00:53:07,962
Is there a way around the bridge?

229
00:53:08,463 --> 00:53:14,470
There is a road... but the
trees, Ash...

230
00:53:15,471 --> 00:53:17,474
They know.

231
00:53:18,683 --> 00:53:21,269
Don't you see, Ash?
They're alive.

232
00:53:33,950 --> 00:53:35,035
Shut up!

233
00:53:40,875 --> 00:53:42,168
Shut up!

234
00:53:57,894 --> 00:53:59,062
Kill her!
Kill her!

235
00:53:59,979 --> 00:54:04,777
Kill her if you can!

236
00:54:11,493 --> 00:54:13,286
God, forgive me.

237
00:54:39,399 --> 00:54:42,403
Oh, Ash, help me, please!

238
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:51,705
Ash, help me, please!

239
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:55,460
Oh, Ash. Please don't let them
take me away again.

240
00:54:56,169 --> 00:54:59,755
- Please!
- No... I won't. I promise.

241
00:55:00,882 --> 00:55:03,969

242
00:55:04,178 --> 00:55:05,888

Won't you like to be going home?
