1
00:00:09,583 --> 00:00:11,665
She told me once,

2
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:15,374
"When we read a story,
we inhabit it."

3
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:20,665
"The covers of the books
are like a roof and four walls."

4
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:22,999
"A house".

5
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:29,207
She, more than anything else in the world,
loved the moment when you finish the book,

6
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:34,374
and the story keeps playing
like the most vivid dream in your head.

7
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:37,874
And after that,
she loved taking long walks

8
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:40,999
to clear her mind
of all the emotions and feelings

9
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,665
the book had started within her.

10
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:21,457
That very morning,

11
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:25,624
after hazy years of reading
and walking,

12
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:28,082
and mourning the death of her husband,

13
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:33,124
Florence Green woke up knowing
exactly what she wanted to do.

14
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:37,707
She was going to open a bookshop in the
little village where she'd ended up living.

15
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:42,124
I am convinced that this bookshop
will be everything you say, Mrs. Green,

16
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:45,999
but, of course, for now I can give you
no definite commitment on behalf of the bank.

17
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:48,457
The decision does not depend upon me.

18
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:51,999
And I have your honest assurance
that you have ample experience in the trade.

19
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:54,874
I learned the trade very thoroughly
when I was a girl.

20
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:57,874
and I don't believe it's changed
greatly since then.

21
00:01:58,041 --> 00:02:00,415
And more importantly I know...

22
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:03,082
I love reading.

23
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:07,249
Well, it would do little harm
to let you know one or two things.

24
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:09,832
Consider them words of advice
if you prefer.

25
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:13,207
She had a great heart,

26
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:15,207
and enormous patience.

27
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:18,624
But not even these two virtues
were strong enough

28
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:22,415
to bear the grandiloquent
and patronizing tones

29
00:02:22,483 --> 00:02:25,082
of Mr. Keble,
the Hardborough banker,

30
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,915
whom everyone called
Mr Potatohead behind his back.

31
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:46,457
I should tell you
there are those who believe

32
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,499
there are other possible uses
for the old house.

33
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:52,374
Of course, there is always
a possibility of a resale.

34
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:55,707
But I have no intention of reselling, Mr Keble.
Not in the slightest.

35
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:59,040
What else do people think
the Old House could be used for?

36
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:01,415
Why have they done nothing about it
in the past seven years?

37
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:03,040
There were birds nesting in it,

38
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:06,415
half the tiles were off the roof,
and it stank of rats.

39
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:09,332
Wouldn't it be better to fill the place
with books for people to look at?

40
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,374
I read before going to sleep,

41
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:15,082
and I usually drift off
to the land of Nod by about the third page.

42
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:19,374
So you see! Don't you realize
how useful books can be?

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,324
The weather in this part of the world
was totally unpredictable.

44
00:03:53,591 --> 00:03:58,332
Sometimes all four seasons
could be present in a single morning.

45
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,249
That sunny day,
she left the bank

46
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:11,957
feeling angry, proud, impatient,
and terribly alive.

47
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,999
She was going to pursue her dream,

48
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:19,449
and nobody, not even Mr. Potatohead,
was going to stop her.

49
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:26,290
Hello, Mrs. Green!
Are you busy?

50
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,624
Hello, Mr. Raven.
Not at the moment. Why?

51
00:04:30,775 --> 00:04:33,124
Can I throw the rope to you?

52
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,665
Yes, of course!

53
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,832
Watch out!

54
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,290
Very slippery.
That's how Ethan broke his leg yesterday.

55
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:45,832
But I'm well aware that you are a woman
who don't frighten easily.

56
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,457
How do you know that?

57
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,374
Rumour has it that you're about
to open a bookshop here.

58
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,040
WHy do you feel it's something daring?

59
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:02,207
The only person here who reads
is Mr. Brundish.

60
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:06,207
I don't think he's going to
be leaving home to be your customer.

61
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:09,915
I think I saw him yesterday on the hill.
Well, caught a glimpse of him anyway.

62
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:13,040
I imagine you had
a long conversation!

63
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:15,374
Yes, never stopped talking!

64
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,332
Yeah, right.

65
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:21,082
Good luck, Mrs. Green!

66
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,749
Do you not read, Mr. Raven?

67
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:26,707
I don't.

68
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,915
Books leave me exhausted.

69
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,749
Real life is enough for me.

70
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:51,707
Mr. Brundish lived alone
in the oldest house in Hardborough.

71
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,124
He didn't particularly
like his own company,

72
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,749
but, after long years of battle,

73
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:02,582
he had reached a lasting truce
with himself.

74
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:08,582
He adored books with the same passion
with which he detested his fellow men.

75
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,582
He often cherished the fantasy that the
volumes he devoured from morning till night

76
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,290
hadn't been written by human beings,

77
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:20,374
but had appeared through
spontaneous generation.

78
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:24,832
There was nothing that bothered him more
than the protraits of writers

79
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,165
often included in certain editions.

80
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:17,832
It's not red.

81
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:21,707
It is a very deep maroon

82
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,874
or rust.

83
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:27,790
Anyway, how is the old house?
How are you coping?

84
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:31,290
Sam Wilkins was in and fixed
the bath, and tarred the roof,

85
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:34,624
and repaired the system as best he could
anyway.

86
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:38,832
That place is like an old fossil.

87
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,249
Even the straw is 500 years old.

88
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:43,165
OK, arms up.

89
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:45,874
There.

90
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:49,124
You are still going to move
in there, aren't you?

91
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,124
I spent my first night there
last night.

92
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:53,332
What! So soon?

93
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,624
I told everyone to watch out.

94
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:59,499
Nobody actually thought you were going to
move into the Old House.

95
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:03,540
Yes, I know they didn't, but it was fine,
a bit creepy in the night,

96
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:07,124
but that's because
I'm not used to it yet, I suppose.

97
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:12,290
I should think a wooden and old house
like that creaks everywhere.

98
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,582
I'm afraid red isn't really for me.

99
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,499
I mean it doesn't really look
good on me from behind, but...

100
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:27,082
Perhaps if I stand against the wall
next time I'm there...

101
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,165
- Too red, don't you think?
- It's not...

102
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:33,332
It's not red.

103
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,540
It is a very deep maroon.

104
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:37,915
Yes.

105
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,582
You'll get used to it in time.

106
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,999
Need a bit of jewellery
to make it stand out.

107
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:45,374
Yes.

108
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,707
- You sure?
- Well, of course I'm sure.

109
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:51,624
It's not every day the General
and Mrs Gamart invite you to a party, is it?

110
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,707
Stop agonizing!

111
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,332
You look...

112
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,165
lovely.

113
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,832
Anyway, when you get there,
you won't have to worry how you look.

114
00:09:01,932 --> 00:09:03,332
No one will mind you.

115
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,040
They'll probably know
all the guests anyhow.

116
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:14,374
I'm Florence Green.

117
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:17,665
I am the one opening
the little bookshop.

118
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,624
That's it, of course!

119
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:23,249
Thought of it right away!

120
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:28,415
Of course. Violet was very interested
in that matter.

121
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:34,040
She wanted one of those
conversations of hers...

122
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,790
with you about the bookshop.

123
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,540
She's rather caught up right now.

124
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:50,832
But I believe she wishes
to talk to you later.

125
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,040
So...

126
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,957
What sort of stuff are you going
to have in your shop?

127
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,332
Well...

128
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,124
Basically books.

129
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,832
They don't publish many
books of poetry these days, do they?

130
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,332
I don't see too many about.

131
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,624
I shall have some poetry, of course,

132
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:19,499
but it doesn't sell quite so well
as other things like novels and essays.

133
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:24,790
It will take me some time to find out
what kind of stock I'll bring in.

134
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:28,999
For the moment I've mainly ordered classics.
Thackeray, Dickens, Keats...

135
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,165
"It is easy to be dead."

136
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:37,124
"Say only this."

137
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,707
"They are dead".

138
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,290
Do you know who wrote that?

139
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:44,832
No.

140
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,040
I'm so sorry, I don't.

141
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,832
I know who you are.

142
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,499
Must be Mrs. Green.

143
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:12,916
Yes.

144
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:16,582
I know who you are, of course, Mr. North.

145
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:22,624
Though I've never had an invitation to the Stead before,
I expect you come here often?

146
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:26,415
Yes, I do get invited frequently.

147
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,957
Oh, thank you. Very kind.

148
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,540
Not very.

149
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:47,415
You live on your own, don't you?
You've just moved into the Old House.

150
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:49,790
All by yourself?

151
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:53,332
War widow.

152
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:57,874
I know.

153
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,499
Have you never thought
of marrying again?

154
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:06,207
No.

155
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:09,082
The problem is I was
very happily married.

156
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,250
How odd.

157
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:14,522
I was always under the impression that it's
precisely when a woman is widowed

158
00:13:14,722 --> 00:13:16,843
that she starts to get happy.

159
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:27,290
Are you sure you've received
the proper advice to run a business?

160
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:37,999
I've never met you before now, Mr. North,
but I assumed, because of your work,

161
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:42,022
you'd be someone who'd appreciate
having a bookshop in Hardborough.

162
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:48,540
I'm sure you know
writers at the BBC,

163
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,499
and thinkers and and so forth.

164
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:57,205
I trust they come down here
from time to time to see you and get some fresh air.

165
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:00,374
If they did come...

166
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,874
I wouldn't know what to do with them.

167
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:06,957
Writers will go anywhere
where there is a free drink.

168
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,499
I'm not so sure about thinkers.

169
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:17,124
I think Kattie, my so-called girlfriend,
would look after them.

170
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:21,582
Anyway, you must both come to my shop.
I shall rely on you.

171
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,665
On no account.

172
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,499
Why are you wearing red?

173
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:36,915
Red's the colour that only looks good
on housemaids on their day off.

174
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:40,124
It's not red, it's a deep maroon.

175
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,832
My dear lady.

176
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:56,249
Florence, isn't it?

177
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:57,416
Yes.

178
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,749
I've been wanting to speak to you
since you arrived,

179
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:03,457
but my guests have nothing better to do
than steer me away from my priorities.

180
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,624
Thank you so much for coming.

181
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:07,999
- Thanks for inviting me.
- It's a pleasure.

182
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:11,707
- It's such a lovely party.
- Everyone is talking about your new ventures.

183
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:13,915
You have such a great nose for business.

184
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,457
Bruno!

185
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:18,624
Have you been introduced to my husband?

186
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,540
Come and tell Mrs. ...

187
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:23,915
Green.

188
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,665
How delighted we are to see her.

189
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:30,957
And to think we've all been praying
for a good bookshop in our little town.

190
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,125
Haven't we, Bruno?

191
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:34,999
Of course, my dear.
There's no harm in praying.

192
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:39,540
Things would probably go much better
if we all prayed more.

193
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:44,790
Just one thing, Ms. Green,
and a very small one at that,

194
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:48,540
You haven't actually moved
into the Old House, have you?

195
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,165
Yes, I have been there over a week.

196
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,124
But there's no water.

197
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:58,982
Sam Wilkins connected the pipes for me.

198
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:02,124
Don't forget, Violet, you've been
in London a good deal lately,

199
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,915
and you haven't been able
to control everything.

200
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,457
Why shouldn't I have moved in?

201
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,957
I believe I can spare you
many disappointments

202
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:12,165
and maybe even a bit of money.

203
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,551
In fact, I hope to help you.

204
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:20,207
There are much more appropriate locations
in Hardborough.

205
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:22,332
Especially for a bookshop.

206
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:26,915
I'm afraid we are all so used to
seeing the Old House empty,

207
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:31,040
that we've procrastinated
year after year.

208
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:35,124
You've practically showed us all
by being in such a hurry, Mrs. Green.

209
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,786
But the fact is...

210
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,576
Many of us are not at all convinced

211
00:16:39,776 --> 00:16:44,158
by the sudden transformation of the Old House
into a shop.

212
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:48,374
Many of us believe
it should be a kind of...

213
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,207
local art centre.

214
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:54,915
Fine, Violet,
you could pray for that also.

215
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:59,207
Chamber music in summer,
lectures in winter...

216
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:02,082
There is simply no other old house

217
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,957
that has that...

218
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,540
ambience.

219
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:12,540
I've been negotiating the sale
for over six months, so...

220
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:17,582
You see, it's hard for me to believe
there's anyone left in Hardborough

221
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,999
who doesn't know about it.

222
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:21,707
In fact, I'm sure
they all know.

223
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,957
We have one great advantage.

224
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:27,249
It would be a shame to just...

225
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,290
throw it away.

226
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:33,040
Now we have exactly the right person

227
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:36,707
to take charge of the matter,
I mean to take charge of the centre.

228
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,832
You do understand, don't you?

229
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,874
Why don't you think it over
for a bit?

230
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,040
Sonia!

231
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,290
How wonderful!

232
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:51,915
Her feet and head ached,

233
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:55,415
and she regretted having taken
the seamstress' advice

234
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,999
as to the colour of her dress.

235
00:17:58,166 --> 00:17:59,624
That was all.

236
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:02,790
Not for one moment did she
think about the consequences

237
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:06,599
that her modest act of inhabiting
the Old House would bring upon her.

238
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,290
You look radiant.

239
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:17,582
Isn't that that Lord Gosfield?

240
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:21,457
What a guest list this evening, Violet!

241
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:27,790
Lord Gosfield.

242
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:31,540
How difficult it has been
to try and reach you this evening..

243
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,832
I hope Bruno has told you

244
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,957
about our new Hardborough centre
for music and the arts.

245
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,749
We were just talking about it.

246
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:49,999
Mrs. Green!

247
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,332
Hi.

248
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,332
- Good Morning.
- Glad I caught you.

249
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,124
- How are you?
- Very well thanks. Very well.

250
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,374
I wanted to ask you about my shop.

251
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:02,665
I wanted to speak to you about my shop.

252
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:04,957
- It's up for auction.
- Yes.

253
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:08,874
Not until April,
it could be later still.

254
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,124
Well, the fact is...

255
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:17,457
I'd much prefer to reach
a private agreement before.

256
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,540
As you've expressed a certain interest
in the property,

257
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:25,749
and since you're not going
to remain in the Old House...

258
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:30,624
I trust that you appreciate
that I am too busy

259
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:33,332
to pay attention
to the rumours that I hear.

260
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:40,082
Well, it stands to reason you'll be making
an offer on the premises.

261
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:45,790
There's been a misunderstanding,
Mr. Deben, but...

262
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:49,624
Yes, but it doesn't matter in the slightest.
And I...

263
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:52,290
I should like
to be able to help you.

264
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,457
Mrs. Gamart was...

265
00:19:56,133 --> 00:20:00,207
kind enough to tell me
about her idea for an art centre.

266
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:04,749
From which I am sure everyone of us
living here in Hardborough would benefit.

267
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:09,749
And I believe she is the one
who is searching about for premises.

268
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:13,249
And what could be better
than your fish shop?

269
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:19,040
Yes, I see.

270
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,707
You've been extremely kind.

271
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,832
- Thank you for your help.
- You're welcome, Mr. Deben.

272
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:29,332
- Good Morning.
- Yes. Thank you, Mrs. Green.

273
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:33,165
Florence had managed to
live life thus far

274
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:36,915
by pretending that human beings
were not divided

275
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:40,915
into exterminators and exterminated,

276
00:20:41,216 --> 00:20:44,332
with the former
at any moment predominating.

277
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,874
I didn't know
if you'd be down in London or...

278
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:04,582
London? No, I'm here.
Well, I think I am.

279
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:11,499
Nescafé?

280
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,707
I've never tried it.

281
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,415
I have heard of it, but I...

282
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,999
I'm told it's not made
with boiling water.

283
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:20,166
Yes.

284
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:34,457
- This is all much too small for you.
- I know.

285
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:40,457
You know, I'm glad
that you've dropped in.

286
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:44,907
No one else compels me
to face the truth.

287
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:49,424
Well, that's fortunate
because I've come to ask you a question.

288
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:52,957
When Mrs. Gamart was talking at her party

289
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,790
about the ideal person
to run an art centre,

290
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:58,707
it was you, of course,
that she had in mind, wasn't it?

291
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:00,665
It wasn't me.

292
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:02,249
Sorry, Violet's party?

293
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:12,499
Did she expect me just to move out of my house
and probably, for that matter, out of the town altogether,

294
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:16,499
assuming that you would come
to the Old House to...

295
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:19,165
manage everything?

296
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:24,974
If she'd been referring to me, I doubt very much
she would have used the word "manage".

297
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:34,332
Do you fancy Nescafé or...

298
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:38,041
not?

299
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:40,165
No. Neither, thank you.

300
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:41,749
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

301
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:44,832
- Do you mind if I...?
- No, no, please.

302
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:48,082
I should probably get going.

303
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,874
Are you...Really?

304
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:53,040
Yes. Thank you anyway.

305
00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:55,790
Well...it's lovely to see you.

306
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:06,290
Well, from what I've heard,
and practically by chance,

307
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:09,665
you've started to think twice
about the whole bookshop operation.

308
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:12,249
Well, then you've heard wrong,
Mr. Thornton.

309
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:17,040
I am here to demand that all unresolved matters
be resolved as quickly as possible

310
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:19,990
so that I might set up the bookshop
without further delay.

311
00:23:20,058 --> 00:23:22,874
- But I was told that you...
- What?

312
00:23:22,941 --> 00:23:26,499
That I'd be leaving the Old House,
which, by the way, is my only home?

313
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:29,874
There are many other vacant properties
in Hardborough.

314
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:33,582
As it happens, I have a list of some
of the more out-of-the-way ones.

315
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:37,540
I expect no further delays, Mr. Thornton.
Please have all pending papers sent to me.

316
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:40,499
And, once again,
I am ever so grateful for your help!

317
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:47,457
Is there something
I can help you with, boys?

318
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:49,457
We are sea scouts, ma'am.

319
00:24:49,625 --> 00:24:52,374
Yes, I see. And just what is it
that you're doing here?

320
00:24:52,541 --> 00:24:56,540
Mr. Raven told us to stop around.
What would you like us to do?

321
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:03,207
I want all the book shelves put up in there.
Do you think you can manage that?

322
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:05,540
How many hand drills
can you get us, ma'am?

323
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:09,624
You've all been waiting here
in the pouring rain.

324
00:25:11,541 --> 00:25:13,415
If I can find my keys...

325
00:25:13,833 --> 00:25:15,499
Okay, hurry up.

326
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:38,624
When Ms. Green opened the first
box of books she had ordered,

327
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:41,874
all the problems and obstacles
of those past few days

328
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:44,040
simply vanished.

329
00:25:44,458 --> 00:25:49,332
With each edition, the faces
and the words of Mrs. Gamart,

330
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,957
the banker,

331
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:52,582
her lawyer,

332
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,499
and Milo North,

333
00:25:54,666 --> 00:25:56,540
all faded away.

334
00:25:58,583 --> 00:26:02,165
And, for a moment,
she felt that her late husband,

335
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:04,707
whom she had loved so dearly,

336
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:07,082
was with her once again.

337
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:19,207
And that was her happiest moment
in the bookshop.

338
00:26:56,416 --> 00:27:00,124
A very lonely job, yours.

339
00:27:01,708 --> 00:27:04,332
Sorry about the waders.

340
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:06,999
I don't feel in the least bit lonely.

341
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:15,124
That shelf over there
is a fifth of an inch crooked.

342
00:27:15,666 --> 00:27:18,374
And that plastering.
It looks hideous.

343
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:22,040
You can let them know
the next time you see them.

344
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:25,624
No, no, it all looks wonderful, Mr. Raven.

345
00:27:25,791 --> 00:27:28,707
I couldn't be happier with the work
the boys have done. Honestly.

346
00:27:29,416 --> 00:27:32,165
Is that you, Wally?
Are your ears burning?

347
00:27:32,875 --> 00:27:35,582
- What are you doing here, boy?
- I have a message for Mrs. Green.

348
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:38,582
- From whom?
- From Mr. Brundish, Mr. Raven.

349
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:39,957
What?!

350
00:27:40,583 --> 00:27:43,207
He just came out of Holt House
and handed you a note?

351
00:27:43,375 --> 00:27:47,457
No, he leaned out of the window and told me
to go and get this to Mrs. Green.

352
00:27:49,375 --> 00:27:51,415
I don't see
how this can be for me.

353
00:27:51,791 --> 00:27:55,332
I've never spoken to Mr. Brundish - ever.
I can't believe he even knows my name.

354
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,374
And whenever I run into him on the headland,

355
00:27:57,541 --> 00:28:00,540
he always goes off like a shot
as if he'd just seen a ghost.

356
00:28:00,708 --> 00:28:02,415
I'm certain he knows
who you are.

357
00:28:02,583 --> 00:28:05,957
He finds out about everything that happens
in town. I don't know how he does it.

358
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:08,582
Don't you worry
about the envelopes' black edges.

359
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:13,040
He ordered those those envelopes back in 1919
when they were all returning from the First War and...

360
00:28:13,833 --> 00:28:15,999
and Mrs. Brundish died...

361
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,290
during their honeymoon.

362
00:28:18,458 --> 00:28:20,957
Oh yes. How did she die?

363
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,665
She was drowned...

364
00:28:24,625 --> 00:28:26,540
crossing the marshes.

365
00:28:27,208 --> 00:28:31,165
She'd gone to pick some blackberries
to bake a pie for Mr. Brundish.

366
00:28:42,458 --> 00:28:43,665
"Dear Madam".

367
00:28:43,833 --> 00:28:45,749
I would like to wish you well.

368
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:50,374
Back in my great-grandfather's day,
there was a bookseller in the high street,

369
00:28:50,541 --> 00:28:53,082
who, if my memory serves me correctly,

370
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:56,249
knocked up one of his customers
with a desk pad

371
00:28:56,416 --> 00:28:58,374
when he became annoying.

372
00:28:59,291 --> 00:29:00,790
There'd been some delay

373
00:29:00,958 --> 00:29:04,957
in the arrival of the latest
installment of a new novel - I believe...

374
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:08,624
I believe it was <i>Dombey and Son</i>.

375
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:12,290
As of that day,
no one has plucked up courage enough

376
00:29:12,458 --> 00:29:15,749
to sell books
in this forsaken corner of the world.

377
00:29:16,875 --> 00:29:18,874
This is a great honour you do us.

378
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:24,249
I should undoubtedly visit your shop one day
if I ever went out.

379
00:29:25,041 --> 00:29:28,790
But nowadays I rather make a point
of never doing this.

380
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:34,665
In spite of everything,
should you deem some literary novelty worthy

381
00:29:34,833 --> 00:29:37,374
please, don't hesitate to send it to me.

382
00:29:38,333 --> 00:29:42,499
In the case of biographies,
it's better, I find,

383
00:29:42,666 --> 00:29:45,790
if they're about good people,
- whereas novels

384
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:49,124
are much more interesting
if they're about nasty people.

385
00:29:49,291 --> 00:29:52,540
Please have the same boy
who delivered this letter bring them to me

386
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:56,124
with a note, obviously,
indicating their price.

387
00:29:56,625 --> 00:29:57,874
Yours...

388
00:29:59,125 --> 00:30:00,832
Respectfully..."

389
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,415
"Edmund Brundish."

390
00:30:04,333 --> 00:30:05,874
My first customer.

391
00:30:11,875 --> 00:30:14,415
Come around later and
I'll give you a package for Mr. Brundish.

392
00:30:14,583 --> 00:30:16,124
Thank you, Mrs. Green.

393
00:30:23,375 --> 00:30:27,540
You'll probably need a bright young helper
in the afternoon, in case it gets busy.

394
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:31,415
I was thinking of
one of the Gipping girls.

395
00:30:31,583 --> 00:30:33,707
Mrs. Gipping is more or less
up to date on the matter,

396
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:37,665
and I thought about asking her
which of her daughters might suit you the best.

397
00:30:37,833 --> 00:30:41,957
I think the youngest, Christine,
is the cleverest,

398
00:30:42,125 --> 00:30:46,290
but she probably wouldn't give her out to you
for that precise reason.

399
00:31:14,375 --> 00:31:17,207
- Good afternoon, Mr. Thornton. Welcome!
- Thank you.

400
00:31:56,666 --> 00:31:58,749
Fahrenheit 451.

401
00:32:00,083 --> 00:32:02,124
What kind of book is this?

402
00:32:13,416 --> 00:32:15,624
You're Christine Gipping, aren't you?

403
00:32:16,625 --> 00:32:19,290
I would have thought
your older sister would...

404
00:32:19,458 --> 00:32:22,207
My elder sister
spends all her time with Charlie Cuts.

405
00:32:22,375 --> 00:32:24,332
In fact, on my way over here,

406
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:28,290
I saw their bikes hidden under fallen leaves
over by the crossroads.

407
00:32:28,458 --> 00:32:30,790
You won't have any trouble like that
with me, though.

408
00:32:30,958 --> 00:32:32,790
Those things aren't happening to me yet.

409
00:32:32,958 --> 00:32:34,749
And I find boys to be repulsive.

410
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:40,999
And what about your other sister?

411
00:32:41,166 --> 00:32:43,874
She spends all her time at home
minding Margaret and Peter.

412
00:32:44,041 --> 00:32:45,874
They're the little ones.

413
00:32:47,208 --> 00:32:50,374
You musn't think I don't want
to consider you for the job,

414
00:32:50,541 --> 00:32:53,124
it's just that you don't
really look old enough.

415
00:32:54,166 --> 00:32:55,166
Or strong enough.

416
00:32:55,958 --> 00:32:58,124
That's hard to say after a first glance.

417
00:32:58,291 --> 00:33:00,582
You look old,
but you don't look strong.

418
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:03,082
It's all the same anyway,
we're all available.

419
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:07,499
But my older sister will be absent from work
half the time,

420
00:33:07,666 --> 00:33:09,249
and the middle one won't show up.

421
00:33:09,416 --> 00:33:11,249
Just a warning.

422
00:33:11,416 --> 00:33:15,599
And I should also let you know I don't like reading.
I like geography and maths.

423
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:26,040
I'll come round this afternoon
and discuss things with your mother.

424
00:33:26,208 --> 00:33:28,657
And don't worry, I won't force you to read.

425
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:29,999
As you wish.

426
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:32,707
All she'll say is that I can
work every day after school

427
00:33:32,875 --> 00:33:34,249
and all day Saturday.

428
00:33:34,416 --> 00:33:37,332
And you can't pay me less
than 12 shillings and six pence a week.

429
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:41,124
And to tell me to shut up
if I speak too much

430
00:33:41,291 --> 00:33:42,707
What about your homework?

431
00:33:42,875 --> 00:33:46,249
I can do that when I get home,
after tea.

432
00:33:49,541 --> 00:33:51,165
I like your cardigan.

433
00:33:52,625 --> 00:33:55,624
Did you knit it yourself?
It looks like it would've been very difficult.

434
00:33:55,791 --> 00:33:57,499
It was in the magazine <i>Women's Issue</i>

435
00:33:57,666 --> 00:34:00,457
But the instructions
were for short sleeves.

436
00:34:00,958 --> 00:34:03,040
You have no children, Mrs. Green?

437
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:04,332
No.

438
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,624
Should I have?

439
00:34:07,791 --> 00:34:08,957
I don't know.

440
00:34:09,125 --> 00:34:12,707
People always say life's passed by women
who have no children.

441
00:34:14,458 --> 00:34:16,457
There aren't enough cards on display.

442
00:34:16,625 --> 00:34:18,290
Shall I put some more out?

443
00:34:23,333 --> 00:34:28,665
They really should be ordered
into romance and nature or something.

444
00:34:33,833 --> 00:34:36,499
- Is this what you call romance?
- Oh my God!

445
00:34:36,666 --> 00:34:38,374
What are these?

446
00:34:38,916 --> 00:34:40,165
I hadn't even seen them before.

447
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:43,665
Those sales reps really don't know
what they're sending you.

448
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:45,165
We've got to throw them away.

449
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:50,632
I'm sure there's a few people in this village
who wouldn't mind getting these in their letterbox.

450
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:51,915
You're right.

451
00:34:52,083 --> 00:34:55,957
Stop looking at them!
You'll be corrupted.

452
00:34:56,625 --> 00:34:59,374
- Where is the bin?
- Don't throw them in the bin!

453
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,499
Come on, have a cup of tea.

454
00:35:08,833 --> 00:35:11,082
Why is Christine so late?

455
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:13,124
She's been working for this lady.

456
00:35:14,208 --> 00:35:15,208
Why?

457
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:18,790
Because he has a shop full of books
for people to read.

458
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:20,291
Why?

459
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,500
I don't know.

460
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:33,124
Good afternoon, Mrs. Gipping.

461
00:35:33,291 --> 00:35:34,832
Come in, Mrs. Green.

462
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,457
Let's have a talk.

463
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:40,124
I'm not sure if Christine has already
spoken to you about the 12 shillings.

464
00:35:40,291 --> 00:35:42,582
Yes, yes, she did.

465
00:35:54,166 --> 00:35:58,040
Dear Madam, spare yourself the trouble
of sending more books of poetry

466
00:35:58,208 --> 00:36:00,415
or spuriously complicated novels.

467
00:36:00,583 --> 00:36:05,540
Please, at your earliest convenience,
send more books by Ray Bradbury.

468
00:36:05,791 --> 00:36:08,665
Yours Respectfully,
Edmund Brundish.

469
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:26,249
Very soon Mrs. Green's business
began to thrive.

470
00:36:26,416 --> 00:36:30,207
Her days were fully occupied
from morning to night.

471
00:36:30,375 --> 00:36:34,165
For a short time she forgot about everything
concerning Mrs. Gamart

472
00:36:34,333 --> 00:36:38,624
and her plans to turn the Old House
into an art centre.

473
00:36:56,125 --> 00:36:57,832
- Good morning, Mrs. Green.
- Hello, Wally.

474
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,457
Thanks you for doing me this favour.
Here you are.

475
00:37:03,416 --> 00:37:06,082
Would you like to come
on an outing, Christine?

476
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:08,999
I can't. We've got new stock
arriving tomorrow.

477
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:10,790
Okay then.

478
00:37:10,958 --> 00:37:11,958
Goodbye.

479
00:37:20,041 --> 00:37:22,582
Wouldn't you like
to go on an outing?

480
00:37:24,083 --> 00:37:26,665
No. I like Wally, but...

481
00:37:27,791 --> 00:37:30,374
Yes, I know, you did tell me
you find boys repulsive.

482
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,249
But believe me...

483
00:37:34,958 --> 00:37:36,457
You'll get over it.

484
00:37:37,458 --> 00:37:39,332
Yes, I suppose.

485
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,040
It's just... I prefer to be here,

486
00:37:42,666 --> 00:37:44,499
in the bookshop with you.

487
00:37:44,666 --> 00:37:46,749
It's fun working here.

488
00:37:46,958 --> 00:37:49,165
Even if I don't like reading.

489
00:38:24,958 --> 00:38:27,374
Mrs. Green, they're dirtying the cards.

490
00:38:29,208 --> 00:38:32,582
Just let them browse. It's part of
the tradition of a bookshop.

491
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:36,040
Yes, but they leave everything in such a mess
and don't buy anything.

492
00:38:36,625 --> 00:38:37,707
Miss?

493
00:38:47,875 --> 00:38:49,290
Florence.

494
00:38:50,041 --> 00:38:52,207
Mr. North. What a surprise!

495
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:59,124
It seems Violet
isn't going to get her own way.

496
00:38:59,958 --> 00:39:02,707
- Has she stopped by you yet?
- We haven't been open very long.

497
00:39:02,875 --> 00:39:05,415
She will.
She'll appear eventually.

498
00:39:05,583 --> 00:39:08,457
She has far too much self-respect not to.

499
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:13,707
I'm sure she is simply
dying of curiosity.

500
00:39:13,875 --> 00:39:16,790
- She'll be quite welcome.
- Are you making any money yet?

501
00:39:16,958 --> 00:39:19,707
- Not yet.
- You really need something like this.

502
00:39:21,208 --> 00:39:22,832
This is volume one.

503
00:39:23,541 --> 00:39:25,374
Is there a volume two?

504
00:39:25,958 --> 00:39:30,499
Yes, but I have lent it to someone,
or left it somewhere.

505
00:39:30,666 --> 00:39:33,540
You should keep them together
as a set.

506
00:39:40,583 --> 00:39:41,832
<i>Lolita</i>

507
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:44,165
Have you read it? Is it any good?

508
00:39:44,333 --> 00:39:45,749
It will make you rich, Florence.

509
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:47,915
Yes, but is it good?
I only stock good novels.

510
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:49,332
They don't move fast, you know.

511
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,040
According to Graham Greene
it is a masterpiece.

512
00:39:52,208 --> 00:39:54,957
Although there are those
who think otherwise.

513
00:39:56,041 --> 00:39:58,457
Thank you for suggesting it.

514
00:39:58,625 --> 00:40:02,082
I sometimes feel the need of good advice.
You're very kind.

515
00:40:03,541 --> 00:40:05,790
You're always making that mistake.

516
00:40:09,791 --> 00:40:11,165
Until next time.

517
00:40:25,625 --> 00:40:28,707
We have the blue one at home.
It has Westminster Abbey on it,

518
00:40:29,375 --> 00:40:31,624
but it goes all the way around the tin.

519
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:35,249
I'll put the heat on.

520
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:38,749
Mum says those paraffin heaters
aren't very safe.

521
00:40:39,833 --> 00:40:44,207
They're not dangerous, as long as you
remember to clean them out properly.

522
00:40:45,333 --> 00:40:48,499
And you don't pour the liquid in
from both sides at once.

523
00:40:49,291 --> 00:40:52,374
You must never do that - ever!
Do you hear me?

524
00:40:54,666 --> 00:40:57,832
I like this old tray.
You can leave it to me in your will.

525
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,040
What?!

526
00:40:59,208 --> 00:41:02,624
I don't think I'm ready
to start thinking about my will just yet.

527
00:41:04,625 --> 00:41:06,582
But when I do,
I'll try to remember that.

528
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:08,499
You will?
Are you sure?

529
00:41:10,583 --> 00:41:11,832
Is the tray from Japan?

530
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,374
No, it's...

531
00:41:13,958 --> 00:41:15,665
Chinese lacquer.

532
00:41:16,958 --> 00:41:19,457
My grandfather brought it back
from Nanking.

533
00:41:20,666 --> 00:41:22,707
He was a great traveller.

534
00:41:23,375 --> 00:41:27,082
I don't think they even make lacquer
like this in China anymore.

535
00:41:28,666 --> 00:41:29,874
Thank you.

536
00:41:43,583 --> 00:41:47,540
I was wondering if you'd like me
to help you with your schoolwork or something.

537
00:41:48,333 --> 00:41:51,290
- We could read things together maybe...
- There's nothing to read.

538
00:41:51,458 --> 00:41:54,165
They give you some pictures and say
which one's the odd one out.

539
00:41:54,333 --> 00:41:56,499
Or they give you some numbers like...

540
00:41:57,541 --> 00:42:02,790
8, 5, 11, 9, 22, and 16,

541
00:42:02,958 --> 00:42:04,790
and you have to say
which one comes next.

542
00:42:08,625 --> 00:42:10,874
I wouldn't begin to know
which one came next.

543
00:42:13,916 --> 00:42:15,290
You're not cold, are you?

544
00:42:15,458 --> 00:42:16,665
No.

545
00:42:17,875 --> 00:42:19,540
That Milo is a ferret.

546
00:42:19,708 --> 00:42:22,582
He smiles just like a ferret.
I wish he'd just go to hell.

547
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,874
Stop it, Christine!

548
00:42:25,041 --> 00:42:28,332
You're too nice.
He's a nasty piece of work.

549
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,357
When I'm older, I'm going to try
to be like him.

550
00:42:30,557 --> 00:42:32,465
It's much more practical.

551
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:40,332
I know you don't like reading,

552
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:44,499
but there's a book I'm afraid
you must read.

553
00:42:45,183 --> 00:42:46,114
What's it about?

554
00:42:46,741 --> 00:42:52,131
It's about good pirates
and evil children.

555
00:42:52,791 --> 00:42:56,290
Promise me that you'll just at least
just open it one day.

556
00:42:56,458 --> 00:42:59,457
Well, if you'll let me have
the Chinese tray in your will.

557
00:42:59,625 --> 00:43:01,165
I can try.

558
00:43:02,875 --> 00:43:04,165
Deal.

559
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,915
Dear Mr. Brundish.

560
00:44:06,208 --> 00:44:10,999
Enclosed you will find a copy of a novel
that has just been published. <i>Lolita</i>.

561
00:44:11,541 --> 00:44:14,582
I must confess
my bewilderment with it.

562
00:44:14,958 --> 00:44:18,999
I'd like to know your sincere opinion of it,
and ask for a bit of advice.

563
00:44:20,208 --> 00:44:23,665
Do you think it's a suitable book
to be sold in my bookshop?

564
00:44:24,375 --> 00:44:27,249
Yours sincerely,
Florence Green.

565
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:31,540
PS. If you don't like the book,
there's no need to pay for it.

566
00:45:33,458 --> 00:45:35,874
Hello, Mrs. Gipping. Is everything alright?

567
00:45:40,833 --> 00:45:43,540
I thought you should know
as soon as possible.

568
00:45:44,083 --> 00:45:45,415
Mr. Brundish has asked me

569
00:45:45,583 --> 00:45:48,249
to deliver my fruitcake on Sunday.

570
00:45:48,791 --> 00:45:51,040
And he's also asked me to ask you

571
00:45:51,208 --> 00:45:54,249
if you'd like to stop by the Holt House
for tea that same afternoon.

572
00:45:56,916 --> 00:45:58,165
This Sunday?

573
00:45:58,333 --> 00:45:59,194
Why yes.

574
00:46:00,648 --> 00:46:03,582
Yes, yes, allright...

575
00:46:04,208 --> 00:46:06,790
Yes, I'll send him a note.
Thank you for the message, Mrs. Gipping.

576
00:46:06,958 --> 00:46:09,665
I've never delivered a cake
to Mr. Brundish before.

577
00:46:11,666 --> 00:46:14,499
I hope this doesn't
become a habit.

578
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,999
Mrs. Green, is it true you're having tea
at Holt House this Sunday?

579
00:46:24,166 --> 00:46:26,290
Yes, Mrs. Keble, it is true.

580
00:46:26,708 --> 00:46:28,873
Is there something I should know
before I go there?

581
00:46:28,973 --> 00:46:30,299
Mrs. Green.

582
00:46:30,499 --> 00:46:32,457
Mrs. Deben.
How is Mr. Deben?

583
00:46:32,625 --> 00:46:35,040
Still having trouble finding a buyer
for the fish shop, I gather.

584
00:46:35,208 --> 00:46:36,040
Poor thing.

585
00:46:36,208 --> 00:46:40,290
I bet the General and Mrs. Gamart
are seething about the matter.

586
00:46:40,458 --> 00:46:42,832
They've never been invited
to Holt House, you know.

587
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,707
Yes, I've heard.

588
00:46:44,875 --> 00:46:47,249
So, Holt House for tea, eh?!

589
00:46:47,558 --> 00:46:50,249
He so jealously guards his privacy

590
00:46:50,416 --> 00:46:53,415
after the tragic death
of his beloved wife.

591
00:46:58,333 --> 00:47:00,957
I sent him some books and...

592
00:47:02,416 --> 00:47:04,624
asked for advice about the bookshop.

593
00:47:04,791 --> 00:47:06,832
Don't you know!

594
00:47:09,708 --> 00:47:12,332
Well, I should get back there,
I suppose.

595
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:15,874
- It's tipping down there.
- Cats and dogs!

596
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:18,707
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

597
00:47:18,958 --> 00:47:21,665
Advice for the bookshop!

598
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:23,457
Hello?

599
00:48:25,083 --> 00:48:26,499
Mr. Brundish?

600
00:48:52,916 --> 00:48:54,915
Come into the dining room.

601
00:50:03,416 --> 00:50:05,499
You asked me a question.

602
00:50:06,458 --> 00:50:07,874
Yes, I did it.

603
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,499
About a new novel.

604
00:50:11,083 --> 00:50:14,790
You were thoughtful enough
to ask me a serious question,

605
00:50:14,958 --> 00:50:17,707
thinking I would be impartial.

606
00:50:18,708 --> 00:50:22,540
You undoubtedly thought
I was quite alone in the world.

607
00:50:23,291 --> 00:50:25,540
Never. I did not for one second...

608
00:50:25,708 --> 00:50:29,249
I imagine you have been told
all kinds of things about me.

609
00:50:29,416 --> 00:50:30,582
All bad.

610
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:31,957
No.

611
00:50:32,333 --> 00:50:33,540
Really.

612
00:50:33,708 --> 00:50:37,582
I am a widower, I'm sure you've been told.
I imagine you've also been told

613
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:41,665
that my wife died whilst gathering blackberries
to make me a pie,

614
00:50:41,833 --> 00:50:45,999
which is the latetst version
going around town.

615
00:50:46,166 --> 00:50:47,374
Well...

616
00:50:47,625 --> 00:50:50,707
none that have been circulating
are true.

617
00:50:53,125 --> 00:50:55,040
- She didn't drown?
- No.

618
00:50:58,208 --> 00:51:01,290
In the sixth month
of our marriage,

619
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:04,374
we both -
having been the best of friends -

620
00:51:05,166 --> 00:51:09,957
decided that a friendly separation
would be for the best.

621
00:51:10,625 --> 00:51:12,207
She lives in London.

622
00:51:12,375 --> 00:51:16,082
I haven't seen her for 45 years,
but according to my information

623
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:18,424
she's still in very good health.

624
00:51:19,666 --> 00:51:21,290
Although, apparently...

625
00:51:21,875 --> 00:51:25,165
she's put on quite a lot of weight.

626
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:28,957
She always loved sweets.

627
00:51:29,125 --> 00:51:34,415
Although I can never remember
her baking a cake in her life.

628
00:51:36,916 --> 00:51:39,915
I suppose for people of Hardborough
it's more picturesque

629
00:51:40,083 --> 00:51:44,707
to imagine Holt House
inhabited by a mourning widower.

630
00:51:44,875 --> 00:51:49,290
As you already know,
Literature has done a lot of damage.

631
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:53,415
Those damned Brontë sisters,
for example,

632
00:51:53,583 --> 00:51:56,415
by whom you have not included
a single copy

633
00:51:56,583 --> 00:52:00,665
in those packages to me,
for which I am ever so grateful.

634
00:52:00,833 --> 00:52:03,590
I imagined
you would have read them already.

635
00:52:05,416 --> 00:52:09,457
One of the Gipping girls, the third one,

636
00:52:10,125 --> 00:52:12,332
lends you a hand in your shop,
I believe.

637
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:15,082
And that is all the assistance
you have at your disposal?

638
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:18,124
I have a bookkeeper
who comes in from time to time,

639
00:52:18,666 --> 00:52:20,249
and then there's my solicitor.

640
00:52:20,416 --> 00:52:23,415
Tom Thornton.
You won't get very far with that one.

641
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:27,832
I can't say I'm very fond
of Mr. Thornton.

642
00:52:31,166 --> 00:52:33,082
You know, Mr. Brundish,

643
00:52:33,958 --> 00:52:39,165
there is a certain responsibility
about trying to run a bookshop.

644
00:52:41,166 --> 00:52:42,832
I magine there is.

645
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:46,665
Especially if not everyone approves of it.

646
00:52:46,833 --> 00:52:49,790
There are certain people

647
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:53,165
who are rather put up
by your bookshop.

648
00:52:53,333 --> 00:52:57,499
Mrs. Green, I refer to Violet Gamart,

649
00:52:58,291 --> 00:53:00,332
who had other plans
for the Old House,

650
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:04,332
and who now, it seems,
has taken further offenses only.

651
00:53:05,791 --> 00:53:07,165
I'm sure that she...

652
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:09,457
means well.

653
00:53:10,791 --> 00:53:13,999
Means well? Violet Gamart?!

654
00:53:15,416 --> 00:53:16,915
That harpy?

655
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:19,957
What she wants isn't...

656
00:53:20,625 --> 00:53:22,499
<i>arts</i> centre.

657
00:53:23,416 --> 00:53:27,665
Now, I ask you, what the hell does
this damn village need with an arts centre?

658
00:53:27,833 --> 00:53:30,124
And how could art have a center?

659
00:53:30,291 --> 00:53:34,582
But she's got it into her head that it does,
and that's the reason she wants to get rid of you.

660
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:36,082
And she won't stop...

661
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,124
until she does.

662
00:53:40,666 --> 00:53:42,332
She can't do that.

663
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,457
It's my bookshop. It's my home.

664
00:53:47,666 --> 00:53:50,790
People like Violet Gamart

665
00:53:51,625 --> 00:53:54,332
have made me what I am, Mrs. Green.

666
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,749
Thanks to her connections and acquaintances,

667
00:53:57,916 --> 00:54:02,332
Mrs. Gamart is a very powerful woman.
Does that not concern you?

668
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:10,332
No.

669
00:54:15,291 --> 00:54:18,049
May I get back
to the reason for my visit?

670
00:54:20,625 --> 00:54:24,749
I'm thinking of making
a first order of <i>Lolita</i>

671
00:54:25,916 --> 00:54:29,599
of 250 copies,
which would be a considerable risk.

672
00:54:30,416 --> 00:54:34,499
Of course, I'm not consulting you in a
business sense. That would be quite wrong.

673
00:54:34,666 --> 00:54:37,915
All I want to know,
before I put in the order,

674
00:54:38,083 --> 00:54:40,499
is whether you think it's a good book

675
00:54:41,125 --> 00:54:46,165
and whether you that it is right
that I should sell it in Hardborough.

676
00:54:48,416 --> 00:54:52,624
I do not attach as much importance
as you do, I dare say,

677
00:54:53,083 --> 00:54:55,499
to the notions of right and wrong.

678
00:54:56,333 --> 00:54:59,332
I have read <i>Lolita</i>,
as you asked me to.

679
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,457
It is a good book,

680
00:55:01,625 --> 00:55:04,832
and therefore I think you should try
and sell it to the people of Hardborough.

681
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,832
They won't understand it,
but that's all for the best.

682
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,249
Understanding makes the mind lazy.

683
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:37,499
Thank you.

684
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:49,249
Thank you, Mr. Brundish.

685
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:55,415
Well, I have given you my opinion.

686
00:55:56,916 --> 00:55:59,915
Let me tell you
what it is I admire

687
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,499
about human beings.

688
00:56:03,083 --> 00:56:05,124
What I value most

689
00:56:05,833 --> 00:56:09,332
it is the one virtue they share
with gods and animals,

690
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:14,749
and which I will therefore no longer
refer to as a virtue.

691
00:56:14,916 --> 00:56:16,332
I mean...

692
00:56:17,833 --> 00:56:19,165
courage.

693
00:56:21,083 --> 00:56:22,790
And you, Mrs. Green...

694
00:56:24,325 --> 00:56:28,499
possess that quality in abundance.

695
00:56:33,083 --> 00:56:34,332
I would like...

696
00:56:36,166 --> 00:56:37,999
I would like to help.

697
00:56:42,958 --> 00:56:44,582
You make me believe,...

698
00:56:45,833 --> 00:56:48,165
once more, in things...

699
00:56:51,416 --> 00:56:54,499
Things I thought forgotten.

700
00:57:19,083 --> 00:57:22,790
Thank you for the tea, Mr. Brundish.
Everything was delicious.

701
00:57:22,958 --> 00:57:24,665
Well, please...

702
00:57:25,416 --> 00:57:27,832
come again when you wish.

703
00:57:28,333 --> 00:57:31,832
And good luck with <i>Lolita</i>.

704
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:34,957
Yes, thank you..

705
00:57:35,416 --> 00:57:38,582
I musn't let myself worry.
"Where there is life, there is hope."

706
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:41,749
God! What a horrifying thought.

707
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:48,500
Yes!

708
00:57:52,666 --> 00:57:53,915
Thank you...

709
00:57:54,833 --> 00:57:56,957
for your advice, Mr. Brundish.

710
00:57:57,333 --> 00:57:58,624
My pleasure.

711
00:58:01,166 --> 00:58:04,582
Do you think <i>Dandelion Wine
</i>will be coming soon?

712
00:58:05,666 --> 00:58:07,582
I must say I can't thank you enough

713
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:10,457
for introducing me to Ray Bradbury.

714
00:58:10,625 --> 00:58:12,665
We'll have Wally bring it round.

715
00:58:16,083 --> 00:58:18,999
Or, maybe, I'll bring it ...

716
00:58:20,833 --> 00:58:22,165
to you.

717
00:58:25,666 --> 00:58:26,915
Well...

718
00:58:27,833 --> 00:58:29,790
I would like that very much.

719
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,832
We've never had so many
of the same one before.

720
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:18,999
Such a long one!

721
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,999
This book is already famous, Christine.
Everybody's heard of it.

722
00:59:24,583 --> 00:59:29,082
Though I don't suppose they ever expected
they'd be able to buy it here in Hardborough.

723
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:33,749
What they won't expect
is to find 250 copies!

724
00:59:39,333 --> 00:59:41,332
You've really lost your head
over this one.

725
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:43,165
THE NOVEL
THAT IS SHOCKING THE WORLD

726
00:59:43,333 --> 00:59:46,165
"September 4, 1959."

727
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:48,582
"Dear Mrs. Green,"

728
00:59:49,625 --> 00:59:53,790
I have in my possession
a letter from John Drury & Co.,

729
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,332
legal representative
of Mrs. Violet Gamart of The Stead,

730
01:00:00,666 --> 01:00:04,582
to the effect
that the current state of your window display

731
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:08,624
is attracting rather undesirable attention

732
01:00:08,791 --> 01:00:11,999
from both potential and actual customers.

733
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:15,415
Their client likewise assures

734
01:00:15,583 --> 01:00:18,665
that she feels personally affronted

735
01:00:18,833 --> 01:00:22,665
by the fact that she,
in her position as justice of the peace

736
01:00:22,833 --> 01:00:26,415
and chairman of numerous committees
(list enclosed herewith),

737
01:00:26,583 --> 01:00:29,999
must carry out her shopping expeditiously.

738
01:00:32,458 --> 01:00:34,124
Dear Mr. Thornton,

739
01:00:34,416 --> 01:00:39,332
You have been my solicitor now for several years,
which allows me to infer that 'acting for me'

740
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:42,915
means 'acting energetically on my behalf'.

741
01:00:43,083 --> 01:00:46,290
Have you even seen the window display
for yourself?

742
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,332
"Dear Mrs. Green,

743
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:52,082
In response to your missive
September 5,

744
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:56,415
I have attempted on two occasions
to approach your shop window,

745
01:00:57,166 --> 01:00:58,665
but found it impossible."

746
01:01:00,166 --> 01:01:01,665
- Understood?
- Yes, Mrs. Green.

747
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:04,124
"Dear Mr. Thornton.

748
01:01:04,791 --> 01:01:07,290
What exactly is your advice then?

749
01:01:07,750 --> 01:01:10,457
Yours truly, Florence Green."

750
01:01:11,166 --> 01:01:13,790
"I think we should eliminate
the agglomerations,

751
01:01:13,958 --> 01:01:19,499
stop your customers from assembling
in the narrowest part of the high street,

752
01:01:19,666 --> 01:01:21,665
before any formal complaint is made.

753
01:01:21,833 --> 01:01:25,531
And I also think
we should put an end

754
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:30,999
to the sale of this banal and sensationalistic
novel by V. Nabokov,

755
01:01:31,166 --> 01:01:33,999
that has given rise to so many complaints."

756
01:01:39,916 --> 01:01:41,249
"Dear Mr. Thornton,

757
01:01:41,416 --> 01:01:44,665
A good book is the precious distillation
of a master spirit

758
01:01:44,833 --> 01:01:48,499
embalmed and preserved for the purpose
of achieving a life beyond life,

759
01:01:48,666 --> 01:01:52,832
which is why it is, undoubtedly,
a necessary commodity.

760
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,332
Yours sincerely, Florence Green. "

761
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
"Dear Madam,

762
01:01:58,166 --> 01:02:01,957
With regard to your request
for an express prohibition

763
01:02:02,125 --> 01:02:05,290
concerning Mrs. Florence Green...

764
01:02:07,666 --> 01:02:09,457
we regret to inform you

765
01:02:09,625 --> 01:02:14,790
We regret to inform you that,
after having been duly advised,

766
01:02:14,958 --> 01:02:18,124
it would be best
to drop this matter,

767
01:02:18,291 --> 01:02:23,290
as the reported crowd seem
to have been curbed by the local police.

768
01:02:24,583 --> 01:02:28,165
My deepest, deepest apologies,
Mrs. Gamart. "

769
01:02:50,416 --> 01:02:51,832
Why won't you come to London?

770
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,977
I can't think of anything worse
than living in London.

771
01:02:54,177 --> 01:02:55,777
You know how I feel about people.

772
01:02:56,166 --> 01:02:57,915
Look at this, look at this,
this is absolutely stunning!

773
01:02:58,083 --> 01:03:00,415
I'm not staying here!

774
01:03:00,666 --> 01:03:02,832
What do you mean you're not staying?
Where are you going?

775
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,806
Oh for goodness sake! You have to
just keep storming off...

776
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:20,082
I've told you...

777
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:22,457
I'm sick of people like Violet!

778
01:03:22,625 --> 01:03:24,624
- What?
- I can't take it anymore, Milo!

779
01:03:24,791 --> 01:03:27,624
Wait. Just be careful,
otherwise you're going to slip!

780
01:03:27,791 --> 01:03:29,082
Hold on. Wait!

781
01:03:31,083 --> 01:03:33,582
What on earth are you doing
sitting there, Florence?

782
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:38,124
I do not know why I go for walks,
it looks like a pensioner.

783
01:03:38,291 --> 01:03:40,999
- And I should get to work.
- Is there room on that step for me?

784
01:03:41,166 --> 01:03:43,332
- Yes.
- I'm Kattie, Mrs. Green.

785
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:45,832
Milo has told me so much about you.

786
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,790
Kattie wouldn't believe there were
any nice spots in Hardborough,

787
01:03:49,958 --> 01:03:53,165
so I brought her out here
to see for herself.

788
01:03:53,833 --> 01:03:56,624
And what is is
that you do at the BBC, Kattie?

789
01:03:56,791 --> 01:04:00,624
I work for the RPD.
Recorded Programmes Department.

790
01:04:00,791 --> 01:04:04,249
Monitoring expenses...
It's not exactly exciting.

791
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:07,665
We've just been for lunch
with Violet Gamart.

792
01:04:07,958 --> 01:04:11,124
Gave her a chance
to not disapprove of us.

793
01:04:11,291 --> 01:04:13,624
Mrs. Gamart is very kind.

794
01:04:14,666 --> 01:04:16,624
Well, not really.

795
01:04:16,958 --> 01:04:18,832
I don't like kind people.

796
01:04:19,291 --> 01:04:20,665
Except for Florence.

797
01:04:22,833 --> 01:04:24,249
Don't flatter me.

798
01:04:31,125 --> 01:04:33,999
I get the feeling
you work less and less every day.

799
01:04:35,125 --> 01:04:36,999
Don't forget the BBC
is a corporation,

800
01:04:37,166 --> 01:04:39,332
and your salary is paid for
with public funding.

801
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:43,624
Kattie deals with that.
She's in charge of my expenses sheet.

802
01:04:49,125 --> 01:04:50,557
Are not you cold, my darling?

803
01:04:50,757 --> 01:04:53,972
Perhaps this time we ought to
quibble off back to our humble abode,

804
01:04:54,833 --> 01:04:58,165
and leave Florence alone,
lost in her thoughts.

805
01:04:59,625 --> 01:05:01,665
I think I'll stay here a little longer.

806
01:05:01,833 --> 01:05:05,457
- As long as I'm not bothering you.
- No, not at all.

807
01:05:24,416 --> 01:05:26,290
Milo told me you're a widow.

808
01:05:26,458 --> 01:05:28,332
Yes, yes, I am.

809
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:30,332
'A widow.'

810
01:05:31,583 --> 01:05:35,832
Such a strange, dark word,
don't you think?

811
01:05:37,666 --> 01:05:39,165
My husband died...

812
01:05:39,958 --> 01:05:41,499
16 years ago.

813
01:05:44,250 --> 01:05:45,999
How did you meet?

814
01:05:46,166 --> 01:05:49,624
We met in a bookshop actually.
In London.

815
01:05:53,666 --> 01:05:56,332
We were in love from the first moment.

816
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:58,499
We had to organize the...

817
01:05:58,666 --> 01:06:02,832
organize and classify
the poetry section together at Muller's.

818
01:06:09,166 --> 01:06:11,499
He used to read aloud to me
every night.

819
01:06:12,166 --> 01:06:15,332
Pepys, and George Eliot, and Thackeray...

820
01:06:16,916 --> 01:06:19,915
"Never give a lady a restive horse".

821
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,665
We loved that one!

822
01:06:27,833 --> 01:06:29,457
We were very happy...

823
01:06:30,291 --> 01:06:33,582
busy doing a million things
and nothing.

824
01:06:34,458 --> 01:06:36,499
And then the war came.

825
01:06:36,666 --> 01:06:39,832
But I still have his letters,
all his letters, and I...

826
01:06:40,331 --> 01:06:41,832
I can still...

827
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:47,290
hear his voice in my head
when I read them.

828
01:06:51,125 --> 01:06:54,165
Milo didn't do you justice
when he described you to me.

829
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:56,909
Oh dear, spare me from Milo's appraisal.

830
01:06:57,045 --> 01:06:58,826
I don't think I want to know
what he thinks of me.

831
01:06:59,077 --> 01:07:01,381
I still don't know
what he thinks of me.

832
01:07:04,166 --> 01:07:06,332
Or if he feels something for me.

833
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:10,332
Or, for that matter,
if he feels anything at all.

834
01:07:13,291 --> 01:07:15,499
I guess that's part
of his thing...

835
01:07:16,666 --> 01:07:18,999
keeping you guessing all the time.

836
01:07:21,166 --> 01:07:22,832
You know what they say,

837
01:07:23,333 --> 01:07:27,749
"With that kind of man you never know
whether he's hiding a rich inner world or...

838
01:07:29,083 --> 01:07:31,165
absolutely nothing".

839
01:07:36,291 --> 01:07:38,290
He'll never read aloud to me.

840
01:07:50,458 --> 01:07:51,999
Aunt Vi!

841
01:08:00,125 --> 01:08:04,457
So, your bill is already having
its third reading. Excellent!

842
01:08:04,625 --> 01:08:07,768
And I have you to thank
for all your inspiration, Aunt Vi.

843
01:08:07,968 --> 01:08:09,219
Whatever do you mean?

844
01:08:09,419 --> 01:08:12,290
The idea came to me during your party
last spring.

845
01:08:12,458 --> 01:08:15,165
Your wonderful campaign
in favour of an arts centre

846
01:08:15,333 --> 01:08:17,582
could become a reality
with a bill like this.

847
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:20,832
And other communities
could benefit as well from...

848
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,249
philanthropists such as yourself.

849
01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:26,832
Well, I've only done
what I felt was right.

850
01:08:29,291 --> 01:08:31,582
The Access to Places of Public Value Bill

851
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:35,290
will make sure the town councils
can acquire their historic properties

852
01:08:35,458 --> 01:08:38,124
by compulsory purchase
for public use.

853
01:08:38,291 --> 01:08:39,832
Isn't it wonderful?

854
01:08:40,166 --> 01:08:44,832
I'm sure your father is smiling down on us
from heaven with great pride at this very moment.

855
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,790
And I'm just so glad we arranged
to meet today of all days.

856
01:08:47,958 --> 01:08:50,582
Precisely when the bill
has been approved.

857
01:08:51,416 --> 01:08:52,999
Do you fancy fish for lunch?

858
01:08:53,666 --> 01:08:55,249
I know a wonderful place
around the corner.

859
01:08:55,416 --> 01:08:58,415
I'm afraid living in Hardborough
puts you off eating fish anywhere else.

860
01:08:58,583 --> 01:09:00,249
It's so fresh down there.

861
01:09:00,416 --> 01:09:01,499
So true.

862
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,915
A spot of tea then?

863
01:09:04,083 --> 01:09:05,124
Perfect!

864
01:09:05,291 --> 01:09:07,665
Then I shall continue
with what I was doing.

865
01:09:07,833 --> 01:09:10,832
I have a sick friend
who needs my attention.

866
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,999
You're such a wonderful,
generous woman, Aunt Vi.

867
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:24,665
Carry on with your work.
Heads down.

868
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,665
Eyes down.
On with your work!

869
01:09:34,333 --> 01:09:36,499
No need to get up, children.

870
01:09:37,125 --> 01:09:38,249
I'm the inspector.

871
01:09:38,416 --> 01:09:39,665
No, you're not!

872
01:09:40,791 --> 01:09:44,249
I'm sorry,
I don't think I know you.

873
01:09:44,416 --> 01:09:45,499
Mrs. Traill?

874
01:09:45,916 --> 01:09:47,415
My name is Sheppard.

875
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:52,165
If you'd be so kind, you may examine my
certificate from the Ministry of Education Authority.

876
01:09:52,333 --> 01:09:55,457
It authorizes me,
under the Shops Act of 1950,

877
01:09:55,625 --> 01:09:57,582
to visit any school

878
01:09:57,750 --> 01:10:00,580
where I have cause to believe
that there are children studying

879
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:03,165
who also engage in some sort of work.

880
01:10:03,333 --> 01:10:07,165
Work?! I can assure you
they'd all love to have a job.

881
01:10:07,333 --> 01:10:10,165
Outside of family businesses
and newspaper deliveries,

882
01:10:10,333 --> 01:10:12,737
you tell me what else
awaits them out there?

883
01:10:12,937 --> 01:10:14,137
And by the way...

884
01:10:14,416 --> 01:10:17,624
I don't remember you
ever visiting here before.

885
01:10:17,691 --> 01:10:18,999
Well, due to staff shortages,

886
01:10:19,166 --> 01:10:22,915
our visits are not quite as frequent
as we would like them to be.

887
01:10:23,083 --> 01:10:25,582
So, who suggested
you come this time?

888
01:10:33,416 --> 01:10:37,290
There is only one
who has a steady job after school.

889
01:10:39,458 --> 01:10:42,290
Christine Gipping
who works regularly.

890
01:10:42,791 --> 01:10:44,082
Where?

891
01:10:46,166 --> 01:10:48,249
The Old House Bookshop.

892
01:10:49,666 --> 01:10:51,749
Stand up, Christine.

893
01:10:55,583 --> 01:10:56,999
If you'll excuse me.

894
01:10:57,666 --> 01:11:00,957
- This is the girl.
- Miss, would you mind coming with me!

895
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,582
- Good day.
- Good day.

896
01:11:32,833 --> 01:11:35,832
I don't want you to think
I hold anything against you.

897
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,499
The law is the law.
That's something I came to say.

898
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:45,957
Experience is important.

899
01:11:46,125 --> 01:11:49,499
The job also says they want her to have experience,
but where can we get it?

900
01:11:50,166 --> 01:11:52,999
But we always tell Christine
that if she needs references,

901
01:11:53,166 --> 01:11:54,665
she only has to come to you.

902
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:58,457
Yes, of course.
All she has to do is ask.

903
01:11:59,416 --> 01:12:02,499
Christine is a wonderful girl,
Mrs. Gipping, and...

904
01:12:03,666 --> 01:12:06,332
I'm very, very fond of her.

905
01:12:08,416 --> 01:12:12,665
But now she'll have an opportunity
to concentrate on her studies.

906
01:12:13,583 --> 01:12:15,999
But she doesn't want
to give up earning money.

907
01:12:16,166 --> 01:12:20,415
No, of course not, but I suppose
after what happened at the school...

908
01:12:20,583 --> 01:12:22,249
Well, we've been looking round a bit.

909
01:12:22,416 --> 01:12:26,165
And we hope they'll be hiring her
to work Saturdays at that new bookshop.

910
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:32,957
New bookshop?

911
01:12:33,125 --> 01:12:36,332
Yes, they will open very soon.
You know. In Deben's.

912
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:38,832
The fish shop.

913
01:12:49,916 --> 01:12:51,665
I had no idea.

914
01:12:51,833 --> 01:12:55,082
You really must keep an eye
on the competition, Mrs. Green.

915
01:12:57,083 --> 01:12:59,124
You will give Christine those references,
won't you?

916
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:04,457
She had no way of knowing this,

917
01:13:04,625 --> 01:13:08,749
but the new bookshop
was not an enterprise like her own,

918
01:13:09,333 --> 01:13:13,665
but an investment
by the simple-minded Lord Gosfield

919
01:13:14,166 --> 01:13:18,165
on the advice of the General
and Mrs. Gamart.

920
01:13:30,458 --> 01:13:33,999
- Thank you for coming, Mrs. Green.
- No need to thank me, Mr. Keble.

921
01:13:35,916 --> 01:13:38,665
Do you realize how very little
working capital you have at the moment?

922
01:13:38,833 --> 01:13:41,957
Yes. It's rather difficult
not to notice.

923
01:13:42,125 --> 01:13:45,615
I daresay things have taken quite a dip
in your business of late, haven't they?

924
01:13:46,666 --> 01:13:50,665
I thought you might like to know
there's a possible buyer for your shop.

925
01:13:53,958 --> 01:13:55,457
Thank you very much.

926
01:14:01,833 --> 01:14:03,082
Mr. Keble...

927
01:14:03,833 --> 01:14:06,332
The shop is not for sale.

928
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,499
Message received.

929
01:14:09,291 --> 01:14:10,624
Thank you for coming.

930
01:14:10,791 --> 01:14:13,499
It has been an incalculable help.

931
01:14:29,958 --> 01:14:31,165
Well...

932
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,499
I really shall miss you.

933
01:14:37,666 --> 01:14:39,499
I don't want to go, you know.

934
01:14:40,125 --> 01:14:42,165
I don't want to work
in that other bookshop.

935
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,165
My mother, she simply doesn't understand...

936
01:14:45,333 --> 01:14:48,624
No, please.
You musn't worry about that.

937
01:14:49,125 --> 01:14:50,749
How can I not worry?

938
01:14:50,916 --> 01:14:53,124
You can't manage this place by yourself.

939
01:14:53,458 --> 01:14:55,999
And no one in this village
will help you.

940
01:14:58,833 --> 01:15:02,582
I shall manage, I absolutely...
I shall manage.

941
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:10,249
I do hope you'll come by.
From time to time. In the evenings...

942
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:12,465
I won't have the time.

943
01:15:15,125 --> 01:15:16,457
Yes. No.

944
01:15:17,583 --> 01:15:20,082
No, of course you'll be busy.

945
01:15:23,166 --> 01:15:25,749
I've got something for you.

946
01:15:31,791 --> 01:15:34,915
Now you won't have to wait
until my funeral.

947
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,624
You're so kind, Mrs. Green.

948
01:15:43,666 --> 01:15:45,499
You're so bloody kind!

949
01:16:14,833 --> 01:16:18,165
Good afternoon, Florence.
Mrs. Green.

950
01:16:18,333 --> 01:16:19,624
Mr. Brundish.

951
01:16:21,333 --> 01:16:23,999
How are things coming along
down there?

952
01:16:30,916 --> 01:16:33,124
I think you know
as well as I do, don't you?

953
01:16:34,333 --> 01:16:36,957
I do know some of it.

954
01:16:39,083 --> 01:16:40,832
What do you intend to do?

955
01:16:41,333 --> 01:16:42,499
Do?

956
01:16:46,291 --> 01:16:47,999
The only thing I can do.

957
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:50,665
Yes.

958
01:16:58,958 --> 01:17:00,082
No!

959
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,332
Carry on.

960
01:17:05,083 --> 01:17:06,665
That's what I was going to do.

961
01:17:10,458 --> 01:17:11,665
Florence...

962
01:17:12,958 --> 01:17:16,415
I would very much like
to have met you at another time in my life.

963
01:17:17,166 --> 01:17:19,290
In another life altogether.

964
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:25,249
But I'm going to do what...

965
01:17:25,791 --> 01:17:28,332
small thing is in my power
to help you.

966
01:17:36,250 --> 01:17:38,332
Mr. Brundish, it's ...

967
01:17:40,333 --> 01:17:42,832
It's very warming to hear, and...

968
01:17:43,666 --> 01:17:46,582
I so appreciate it.

969
01:17:48,291 --> 01:17:49,499
You musn't...

970
01:17:50,083 --> 01:17:51,499
There is nothing you...

971
01:17:52,083 --> 01:17:55,832
I will have a word with her.
I will talk to that woman.

972
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,082
She might just listen, she might...

973
01:17:59,958 --> 01:18:02,665
put an end to this loathesome harrassment.

974
01:18:06,458 --> 01:18:07,915
You'd really do that?

975
01:18:08,583 --> 01:18:09,749
Really?

976
01:18:11,166 --> 01:18:13,790
Come out of your seclusion for me?

977
01:18:14,625 --> 01:18:16,249
Indeed I will.

978
01:18:18,625 --> 01:18:22,415
I don't know that it should be of much use,
but I'm willing.

979
01:18:23,833 --> 01:18:26,465
I could just put
a bullet through her, but...

980
01:18:33,166 --> 01:18:35,632
I'm not sure
that would be to your liking.

981
01:18:40,666 --> 01:18:43,290
I don't know
how to ever thank you, that's...

982
01:18:44,333 --> 01:18:46,165
That's the most...

983
01:18:49,791 --> 01:18:54,624
noble gesture
anyone has ever made for me.

984
01:20:12,916 --> 01:20:15,290
You work too hard, Florence.

985
01:20:15,458 --> 01:20:17,332
I try to concentrate.

986
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:20,965
Please put those down. They've only
just come in. I haven't checked them yet.

987
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:26,665
Surely you have to succeed
if you give everything you have.

988
01:20:26,833 --> 01:20:28,499
I can't see why.

989
01:20:29,083 --> 01:20:31,832
Everyone gives everything they have
eventually.

990
01:20:32,458 --> 01:20:35,624
We all die.
Dying is hardly a success.

991
01:20:35,791 --> 01:20:38,082
Too young to bother about dying.

992
01:20:39,666 --> 01:20:42,249
I believe Kattie might snuff it..

993
01:20:42,833 --> 01:20:46,165
- She wastes so much energy.
- How is Kattie?

994
01:20:48,791 --> 01:20:50,165
No idea.

995
01:20:52,333 --> 01:20:54,624
As a matter of fact,
she's left me.

996
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,415
She's... well, she's gone to live
with someone else.

997
01:20:58,750 --> 01:20:59,999
In Wantage.

998
01:21:00,916 --> 01:21:02,082
She's... you know...

999
01:21:02,916 --> 01:21:05,082
He works in the World Service.

1000
01:21:10,750 --> 01:21:12,665
I'm opening my heart to you.

1001
01:21:16,250 --> 01:21:18,457
We're having a special moment,
aren't we?

1002
01:21:22,958 --> 01:21:25,915
I expect you have told everyone
in Hardborough who'll listen to you.

1003
01:21:26,083 --> 01:21:28,457
Yes, but it affects you particularly

1004
01:21:28,625 --> 01:21:31,624
because I'll have so much more
free time as of now.

1005
01:21:31,791 --> 01:21:35,999
I'll be able to work here,
part-time, as your assistant.

1006
01:21:36,791 --> 01:21:38,790
I guess you must miss
that little girl.

1007
01:21:45,333 --> 01:21:47,457
Christine learned a great deal
when she was here,

1008
01:21:47,625 --> 01:21:50,082
and he was extremely nice
with the customers.

1009
01:21:50,250 --> 01:21:51,999
Not as nice as I can be.

1010
01:21:54,291 --> 01:21:55,582
So...

1011
01:21:56,458 --> 01:21:58,457
How much can you pay me?

1012
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,582
I gave Christine 12 shillings
and 6 pence a week.

1013
01:22:08,750 --> 01:22:10,999
I won't be able to offer any more
than that at the moment.

1014
01:22:11,625 --> 01:22:14,165
If you are interested in the job,
you may come by in the afternoons

1015
01:22:14,333 --> 01:22:15,910
for a few weeks and try it out.

1016
01:22:16,110 --> 01:22:17,510
Trial period!

1017
01:22:17,750 --> 01:22:21,415
But please remember I didn't offer
you the job. You asked yourself.

1018
01:22:21,583 --> 01:22:25,082
Has anyone ever told you
you have a marvellous pair of ankles?

1019
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:26,749
Oh, do shut up!

1020
01:22:27,958 --> 01:22:29,249
Go home!

1021
01:22:45,458 --> 01:22:47,665
OPEN

1022
01:22:49,125 --> 01:22:51,124
CLOSED

1023
01:22:51,291 --> 01:22:55,624
"Shower down thy love, o burning bright"

1024
01:22:56,625 --> 01:23:01,249
For one night or the other night
will come the gardener in white

1025
01:23:02,666 --> 01:23:06,249
and gathered flowers are dead."

1026
01:23:06,416 --> 01:23:07,790
Christine!

1027
01:23:08,458 --> 01:23:10,124
You'd better watch out, Mr. North.

1028
01:23:14,666 --> 01:23:18,665
What unpleasant expressions
they teach you in that school!

1029
01:23:19,291 --> 01:23:20,957
I didn't come her to see people of...

1030
01:23:21,625 --> 01:23:22,999
your sort.

1031
01:23:27,083 --> 01:23:28,499
Why...?

1032
01:23:30,083 --> 01:23:32,082
Why are you not helping Ms. Green anymore?

1033
01:23:33,250 --> 01:23:34,832
She misses you.

1034
01:23:35,750 --> 01:23:39,165
She's got you, hasn't she?
You're always in and out.

1035
01:23:43,750 --> 01:23:45,957
They say they won't
let her keep the bookshop.

1036
01:23:46,125 --> 01:23:50,665
- They say? Who say? You say?
- You know very well who.

1037
01:23:50,833 --> 01:23:55,332
- They have other plans for the Old House.
- Why do you even care, you little shrimp?

1038
01:23:56,166 --> 01:23:57,999
They say she can't keep it.

1039
01:23:58,833 --> 01:24:01,999
She'll go after her.
She'll take her to court.

1040
01:24:02,166 --> 01:24:04,249
She'll just swear to tell the truth.

1041
01:24:04,416 --> 01:24:07,124
The whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

1042
01:24:08,166 --> 01:24:10,832
Well, we must hope
that it doesn't come to that.

1043
01:24:12,458 --> 01:24:15,290
I never had the time to sit around
when I was her assistant.

1044
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,665
No wonder!
You're a child...

1045
01:24:19,958 --> 01:24:21,332
or a woman.

1046
01:24:22,458 --> 01:24:25,290
Neither of them have any idea
of how to relax.

1047
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,582
You'd just better watch out!

1048
01:24:27,750 --> 01:24:30,715
I've come to get this.
It belongs to my mum.

1049
01:25:24,958 --> 01:25:26,165
Thank you.

1050
01:25:34,166 --> 01:25:35,499
Give me a moment.

1051
01:26:02,125 --> 01:26:04,957
What a pleasant surprise,
Mr. Brundish.

1052
01:26:06,166 --> 01:26:08,124
Please, have a seat.

1053
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,165
Thank you.

1054
01:26:16,666 --> 01:26:18,332
I have come to ask you something.

1055
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:20,624
I don't know if
if this is the proper way to do so,

1056
01:26:20,791 --> 01:26:22,399
but I can't think of a better one.

1057
01:26:22,466 --> 01:26:26,532
If you are not in the mood for questions,
you should say so now.

1058
01:26:27,833 --> 01:26:29,665
Would you like some tea?

1059
01:26:32,291 --> 01:26:34,124
I don't want your tea.

1060
01:26:34,750 --> 01:26:37,382
I want you to leave Florence Green alone.

1061
01:26:38,791 --> 01:26:41,999
- Did she ask you to come and see me?
- Certainly not.

1062
01:26:43,166 --> 01:26:46,957
She is simply a woman
who wants to keep a bookshop.

1063
01:26:47,833 --> 01:26:52,415
If Ms. Green has reason to complain,
I suppose we should turn to a solicitor.

1064
01:26:52,583 --> 01:26:55,882
Though I believe she's rather given
to changing her legal advice.

1065
01:26:55,950 --> 01:26:58,884
The bookstore is drafty,
impossible to mortgage a second time,

1066
01:26:59,084 --> 01:27:00,184
and from what I've heard: damp!

1067
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:02,999
Leave her alone.
The woman has done nothing to you.

1068
01:27:03,700 --> 01:27:08,249
Has is not occured to you,
as someone who must be extremely concerned

1069
01:27:08,416 --> 01:27:10,957
about the welfare
and future of this place,

1070
01:27:11,125 --> 01:27:14,999
that a building of such historical interest
could be put to a better use.

1071
01:27:15,166 --> 01:27:18,124
Old age is not the same thing
as historical interest.

1072
01:27:18,291 --> 01:27:21,249
Otherwise you and I would be
far more interesting than we are.

1073
01:27:21,416 --> 01:27:25,165
I repeat, I want you to leave my friend
Florence Green alone!

1074
01:27:25,333 --> 01:27:26,832
Alone!

1075
01:27:32,958 --> 01:27:38,249
Well, it appears your friend has failed
to take the law into consideration.

1076
01:27:38,958 --> 01:27:42,124
Something which I've observed
on several occasions.

1077
01:27:42,291 --> 01:27:44,910
If that is the case,
I can have nothing to say in the matter.

1078
01:27:45,110 --> 01:27:46,737
The law will have
to take its course.

1079
01:27:46,937 --> 01:27:49,665
Are you referring to a law
that didn't exist a year ago

1080
01:27:49,833 --> 01:27:52,332
and that parliament approved
behind our backs?

1081
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,249
I'm talking about an order
for compulsory purchase,

1082
01:27:55,416 --> 01:27:57,665
or an eviction,
which is the proper term.

1083
01:27:57,833 --> 01:28:00,915
Did you put your precious nephew
up to drafting that bill?

1084
01:28:01,083 --> 01:28:04,665
I won't deny my nephew's bill
may affect the bookshop,

1085
01:28:04,833 --> 01:28:08,415
as it is essential the premises
must have remained empty for five years.

1086
01:28:08,583 --> 01:28:12,082
That would undoubtedly apply
to the Old House.

1087
01:28:12,250 --> 01:28:17,499
But there are so many regulations
to be considered, Mr. Brundish.

1088
01:28:17,666 --> 01:28:21,457
Ordinary mortals like myself
and of course like you

1089
01:28:21,833 --> 01:28:23,480
would hardly know where to begin.

1090
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:25,092
I am in politics,

1091
01:28:25,292 --> 01:28:28,665
and, subsequently,
I'm fairly familiar with bureaucracy,

1092
01:28:28,833 --> 01:28:30,999
but this goes way beyond me.

1093
01:28:31,166 --> 01:28:35,499
We wouldn't even know
how to find the right person to write to.

1094
01:28:35,666 --> 01:28:38,832
Madam, I know perfectly well
who to write to.

1095
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,749
Over the past years,
if I'd not made it my business to know,

1096
01:28:41,916 --> 01:28:44,165
I would have lost
several hundred acres of marshes,

1097
01:28:44,333 --> 01:28:46,832
and farming land, and two pumping mills.

1098
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:50,665
That's why I'm certain
that if nothing has been done so far,

1099
01:28:50,833 --> 01:28:53,790
we can still form
a common front against them.

1100
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:58,472
We can certainly think of ways
of making the move easier

1101
01:28:58,650 --> 01:29:00,499
if it is actually made.

1102
01:29:00,666 --> 01:29:03,457
There are still plenty
of other places to let

1103
01:29:03,625 --> 01:29:05,999
in larger towns than Hardborough.

1104
01:29:06,166 --> 01:29:07,832
That's not what I'm talking about!

1105
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,965
You should be talking about
what I'm talking about.

1106
01:29:24,916 --> 01:29:26,957
I wish I could do something more.

1107
01:29:30,500 --> 01:29:33,490
I assume then
that you intend to do nothing.

1108
01:29:41,958 --> 01:29:44,790
You mustn't speak to me
that way, Mr. Brundish.

1109
01:29:48,750 --> 01:29:51,124
You don't realize
what you are saying.

1110
01:29:51,916 --> 01:29:54,415
You seem to think
I'm an outrageous person.

1111
01:29:54,833 --> 01:29:56,082
Is that it?

1112
01:29:59,458 --> 01:30:02,290
I can't answer that question
"yes" or "no".

1113
01:30:02,458 --> 01:30:06,082
I suspect that by "outrageous"
you mean "unexpectedly offensive",

1114
01:30:06,250 --> 01:30:09,499
and the truth is
you have been fairly offensive, but also...

1115
01:30:11,666 --> 01:30:14,415
repulsive, Mrs. Gamart.

1116
01:30:15,125 --> 01:30:18,415
That is, you have behaved
exactly as I expected.

1117
01:34:02,666 --> 01:34:04,582
Good afternoon, General.

1118
01:34:05,791 --> 01:34:07,499
You wouldn't like a book,
would you?

1119
01:34:09,833 --> 01:34:11,415
Not exactly.

1120
01:34:13,083 --> 01:34:14,999
I just came to say:

1121
01:34:17,250 --> 01:34:19,132
"A good man has left us."

1122
01:34:25,625 --> 01:34:29,915
I believe you knew Edmund Brundish
quite well, did you not?

1123
01:34:31,583 --> 01:34:32,915
I feel as though I did.

1124
01:34:33,083 --> 01:34:35,699
I never crossed words
with him at all.

1125
01:34:36,833 --> 01:34:38,832
He was in the First Mess, of course...

1126
01:34:40,416 --> 01:34:42,082
but not in the Suffolks.

1127
01:34:45,250 --> 01:34:47,624
He signed up for the Air Force,
I believe.

1128
01:34:49,833 --> 01:34:51,457
He wanted to fly.

1129
01:34:52,750 --> 01:34:53,957
How odd.

1130
01:34:57,750 --> 01:35:01,582
It was also odd that he came
to see us that very morning.

1131
01:35:02,416 --> 01:35:06,165
I wanted to speak to your wife,
I imagine.

1132
01:35:06,833 --> 01:35:08,332
Yes, you're quite right.

1133
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:10,749
Violet told me all about it.

1134
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:17,749
He made a great effort to go see her...

1135
01:35:18,833 --> 01:35:21,957
to congratulate her on her idea.

1136
01:35:25,291 --> 01:35:28,499
I'm referring to the Arts Centre.

1137
01:35:34,666 --> 01:35:38,290
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance
to speak to him.

1138
01:35:41,125 --> 01:35:44,832
I must say I would
never have imagined him

1139
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,832
being interested in art.

1140
01:35:50,250 --> 01:35:51,665
But well...

1141
01:35:54,666 --> 01:35:56,790
A good man has left us.

1142
01:36:02,083 --> 01:36:04,332
Anyone could suffer an attack like that

1143
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:07,124
if you think about it.

1144
01:36:14,125 --> 01:36:16,949
You musn't be late
to your lunch party, General.

1145
01:36:20,250 --> 01:36:22,665
Leave my house
and don't ever come back.

1146
01:36:25,250 --> 01:36:26,457
And please...

1147
01:36:27,250 --> 01:36:30,749
don't you or your wife
ever again malign

1148
01:36:30,916 --> 01:36:33,332
a man who had more dignity...

1149
01:36:34,791 --> 01:36:36,415
sensitivity...

1150
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:42,165
and compassion than either of you
will have in your time.

1151
01:36:47,750 --> 01:36:49,832
Don't ever say his name again.

1152
01:36:54,166 --> 01:36:55,832
And forget mine.

1153
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,290
But she...

1154
01:37:04,583 --> 01:37:05,583
Violet...

1155
01:37:05,666 --> 01:37:06,957
LEAVE!

1156
01:37:17,625 --> 01:37:22,332
So it seems I have been evicted
by the city of Flintmarket.

1157
01:37:22,750 --> 01:37:25,915
As we mentioned
during our last phone conversation,

1158
01:37:26,083 --> 01:37:29,915
it seems there's a new parliament bill
which allows Flintmarket Council

1159
01:37:30,083 --> 01:37:32,999
to take over ownership of the Old House.

1160
01:37:33,166 --> 01:37:34,290
Yes.

1161
01:37:34,666 --> 01:37:37,165
And I should like to know,
if I may,

1162
01:37:37,333 --> 01:37:42,582
where the Council obtained the funds
necessary to throw me out?

1163
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,832
They apparently found a benefactor.

1164
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:51,082
What concerns me is if the Old House
is considered to be habitable or not.

1165
01:37:51,250 --> 01:37:54,499
If it turns out that it is unfit
for human habitation,

1166
01:37:54,666 --> 01:37:59,499
or indeed subsidence is threatened,
then it will be impossible to demand compensation.

1167
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:02,290
You won't see a penny.

1168
01:38:02,458 --> 01:38:06,165
I'm inhabiting it
and I'm still human.

1169
01:38:08,833 --> 01:38:10,499
It's not even as damp
as all that.

1170
01:38:10,666 --> 01:38:13,790
In the summer
it's really quite dry and in mid-winter...

1171
01:38:13,958 --> 01:38:16,332
Here is an inspection of the cellars,

1172
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:21,082
according to which the property
is standing in half an inch of water.

1173
01:38:23,916 --> 01:38:26,332
Sorry, what inspection?

1174
01:38:28,916 --> 01:38:31,499
I wasn't informed of any inspection,
I don't think.

1175
01:38:31,666 --> 01:38:35,790
Apparently, on several occasions,
when you were absent from the property,

1176
01:38:35,958 --> 01:38:40,032
an expert in masonry and plastering,
a Mr. John Gipping,

1177
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:41,882
was sent by the Council

1178
01:38:41,950 --> 01:38:45,749
to inspect the condition
of the walls and the cellars.

1179
01:38:45,916 --> 01:38:48,965
John Gipping? Christine's father?

1180
01:38:49,666 --> 01:38:52,582
We assume he entered peaceably.

1181
01:38:52,750 --> 01:38:55,249
I don't remember letting him in myself.

1182
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,957
Your assistant, Mr. Milo North...

1183
01:38:59,666 --> 01:39:01,915
Everyone assumed
he acted as your servant

1184
01:39:02,083 --> 01:39:04,249
and was following your instructions.

1185
01:39:05,833 --> 01:39:08,864
Have you any comments?

1186
01:39:23,416 --> 01:39:25,499
What leaves us
in a difficult position

1187
01:39:25,666 --> 01:39:29,165
is the fact that Mr. North
has also signed a statement,

1188
01:39:29,333 --> 01:39:34,499
according to which the level of dampness
in the property has affected his health,

1189
01:39:35,125 --> 01:39:40,249
making him unable to accept
any type of ordinary employment.

1190
01:40:16,958 --> 01:40:18,415
Why?

1191
01:40:20,833 --> 01:40:22,499
There is no why.

1192
01:40:24,083 --> 01:40:27,290
They asked me persistently,
so you know...

1193
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,999
I simply thought I'd better do it.

1194
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:36,832
If you're looking for a new assistant,
I believe Christine is available.

1195
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:40,124
She's no longer working
at the new bookshop.

1196
01:40:42,958 --> 01:40:45,790
She tried to sell <i>Lolita</i>
to the vicar.

1197
01:40:48,333 --> 01:40:49,582
Florence!

1198
01:44:03,666 --> 01:44:05,665
Mrs. Green! Mrs. Green!

1199
01:44:05,833 --> 01:44:07,665
- Christine.
- Mrs. Green.

1200
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:11,000
Mrs. Green.

1201
01:44:11,166 --> 01:44:12,415
Goodbye.

1202
01:44:16,916 --> 01:44:18,332
For years to come,

1203
01:44:18,791 --> 01:44:23,699
I will remember how she tried to smile
looking at the book I had in my hands.

1204
01:44:28,916 --> 01:44:30,999
Then, she realized

1205
01:44:31,166 --> 01:44:33,165
what I had done.

1206
01:44:56,916 --> 01:44:59,082
She had fulfilled the dream,

1207
01:45:00,083 --> 01:45:02,457
and they'd snatched it
away from her.

1208
01:45:03,750 --> 01:45:06,332
But what she possessed deep down

1209
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:09,665
was something no one could ever
take away from her.

1210
01:45:10,666 --> 01:45:11,957
Her courage.

1211
01:45:18,666 --> 01:45:22,249
And it was that courage
and her passion for books

1212
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,082
that she bequeathed to me,

1213
01:45:25,833 --> 01:45:28,749
along with the Chinese lacquered tray.

1214
01:45:43,291 --> 01:45:45,249
How right she was when she said

1215
01:45:45,416 --> 01:45:48,332
that no one ever feels alone

1216
01:45:49,166 --> 01:45:50,790
in a bookshop.

1217
01:45:50,990 --> 01:45:54,890
