for instance, tHat I sHould bring
Claudia ScHiffer as my date to tHe funeral,

196
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,469
I was confident sHe expected me to ignore.

197

But otHers sHe was pretty damn clear about.

198
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,957
WHen sHe first mentioned
wHat's about to Happen,

199
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,514
I said, "Over my dead body."

200
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,597
And sHe said, "No, Daniel, over mine."

201
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,677
And as usual, my darling girl...

202

THose young popsters come CHristmas

369
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,555
Find a venue, over-order on tHe drinks,

370
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,479
and advise tHe girls to avoid Kevin

371
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,832
- Wives and family and stuff?
- YeaH. I mean, not cHildren.

372
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:05,350
But tHeir wives and girlfriends, et cetera.

373
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:10,918
OH, CHrist, you Haven't got some Horrible
six-foot, tigHt-T-sHirt-wearing boyfriend?

374
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,556
No. I'll just be Hanging around tHe mistletoe,
Hoping to be kissed.

375
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,479
Really?

376
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,511

377
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,189
He now spends all tHe time in His room.
I mean, He'll be up tHere now.

378
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,789
- THat's not unusual. My Horrid son...

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:42,197
Bernard. Stays in His room all tHe time.
THank goodness.

380
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,959
YeaH, but Karen, tHis is all tHe time.

381
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:50,353
I'm afraid tHat tHere's sometHing
really wrong, you know?

382
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,391
I mean, clearly it's about His mum

383
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:57,389
but CHrist, He migHt be injecting Heroin
into His eyeballs for all I know.

384
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,158
(Karen) At tHe age of 1 1?

385
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,273
(Daniel) Well, maybe not His eyeballs, tHen.
Maybe just His veins.

386
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:07,518
THe problem is His mum
always used to talk to Him, you know, and...

387
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:14,280
I don't know, tHis wHole stepfatHer tHing
seems suddenly to someHow matter

388
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,515
Iike it never did before.

389
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:21,190
Listen, it was always going to be
a totally sHit time.

390
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,708
Just be patient.

391
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,035
And maybe cHeck tHe room for needles.

392
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,870
And tHen wHen He sometimes does
come out, it's obvious He's been crying.

393
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:43,070
It's just sucH a ridiculous waste.

394
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,237
And now if it's going to ruin
Sam's life as well...

395
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,233
I just don't know.

396
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,874
Get a grip.

397
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,036
People Hate sissies.

398
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,231
No one's ever gonna sHag you
if you cry all tHe time.

399
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,113
YeaH. Absolutely.

400
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,151
Helpful.

401
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:14,229
So, wHat's tHe problem, Samuel?

402
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:20,670
Is it just Mum or is it sometHing else, HuH?

403
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,070
Maybe scHool?

404
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,077
Are you being bullied?

405
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,236
Or is it sometHing worse?

406
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,190
Can you give me any clues at all?

407
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,797
- You really want to know?
- I really want to know.

408
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,308
Even tHougH you won't be able to Help?

409
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,874
Even if tHat's tHe case, yeaH.

410
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,155
OK. Well...

Sorry?

414
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,831
I know I sHould be tHinking

416
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,953
- Aren't you a bit young to be in love?
- No.

417
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,912
AH, well. OK, well...

418
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:16,114
I'm a little relieved.

419
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,230
- WHy?
- Because l...

420
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,350
tHougHt it'd be sometHing worse.

421
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,312
Worse tHan tHe total agony of being in love?

422
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,920
Er...

423
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,554
No, you're rigHt.

424
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,670
Total agony.

425
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,316
- NigHt, SaraH.
- NigHt, Karl.

426
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,591

427
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,791
YeaH, absolutely.

428
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,990
Free as a bird. Fire away.

429
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,270
Alone again.

430
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,118
Naturally.

431
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,230

Natalie.

435
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,039
Erm, I'm starting to feel...

436
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,755
uncomfortable about us
working so closely every day

437
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:25,191
and me knowing so little about you,
it seems elitist and wrong.

438
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,992
Well, tHere's not mucH to know.

439
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,430
Well, erm, wHere do you live, for instance?

440
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,596

- AH, my sister lives in WandswortH.
- OH.

442
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,548
So wHicH exactly is tHe dodgy end?

443
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:44,070
At tHe end of tHe HigH street,
Harris Street, near tHe queen's Head.

444
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,873
- OH, yeaH, yeaH, tHat is dodgy.
- Hm.

445
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:51,038
Erm, and you live
witH your Husband? Boyfriend?

446
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,118
- THree illegitimate but cHarming cHildren?

447
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:59,631
I've just split up witH my boyfriend, so

448
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:03,832
- AH. Sorry.
- No, it's fine.

449
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,235
I'm well sHot of Him.

450
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,999
- He said I was getting fat.
- I beg your pardon?

451
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:12,828
He said no one'd fancy a girl
witH tHigHs tHe size of tree trunks.

452
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,394
Not a nice guy, actually, in tHe end.

453
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,671
No.

454
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,516
You know, erm...

455
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,317
being Prime Minister,
I could just Have Him murdered.

456
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,749
THank you, sir. I'll tHink about it.

457
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,588
Do. THe SAS are absolutely cHarming.

458
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,474
RutHless, trained killers
are just a pHone call away.

459
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,911
OH, God.

460
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,715

00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,554
YeaH, course you did, you saucy minx.

462
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,910
So, let's go. We can definitely crack tHis.

463
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,110
Remember, I was a kid once, too.

464
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:09,392
So, come on, it's someone at scHool. RigHt?

00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,312
And wHat does sHe, He, feel about you?

467
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:17,193
SHE doesn't even know my name.

468
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,959
And even if sHe did, sHe'd despise me.

469
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,275
SHe's tHe coolest girl in scHool.

470
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,279
And everyone worsHips Her
because sHe's Heaven.

471
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,754
Good. Good.

472
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,030
Well,

00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,674

00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,029
Hi tHere and welcome back.

476
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:47,232
So, tHree weeks till CHristmas, looks like
tHe real competition is gonna be Blue.

477
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:51,637
I saw tHem on tHe sHow last week.
THey weren't very nice about my record.

478
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,989
No. Little scamps.

479
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:57,350
But very, very talented musicians.

480
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:01,518
YeaH. I understand you've got a prize
for our competition winners.

OH, great.

484
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:12,229
It's brilliant. It even writes on glass,

485
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:16,876
so if you've got a framed picture,
like, for instance, tHis one of Blue,

486
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,911
you can just write on it.

To be Honest, I didn't really...

510

00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,629
Just never been able to tie a girl down.

571
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,240
Not sure tHat politics and dating go togetHer.

572
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,158
Really? I've never found tHat.

573

YeaH, you're still sickeningly Handsome,

YeaH, sHe's terrific. At Her job.

581
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:16,476
No, absolutely not. We cannot
and will not consult on tHat eitHer.

582
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,351
THat is unexpected.

583
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,789
Well, it sHouldn't be.

584
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,912
THe last administration
made it perfectly clear.

585
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,713
We're being consistent witH tHeir policies.

586
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,513
WitH all respect, tHey were bad policies.

587

THanks, Alex. I don't tHink
we're making progress Here.

Sorry if our line was firm but tHere's
no point in tiptoeing around today,

591
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,273
tHen just disappointing you for four years.

592
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,153
I Have plans and I plan to see tHem tHrougH.

593
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,158
Absolutely.
THere is one final tHing to look at.

594
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,317
It's very close to my Heart.
Just give me a second.

595
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,874
I'll give you anytHing you ask for.

596
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,912

I don't wanna give.

601
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,790
Er, Natalie,

602
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:48,595
I Hope to see mucH more of you
as our countries work toward a better future.

603
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,029
THank you, sir.

00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,517
Er, yes, Peter.

605

Mr President, Has it been a good visit?

606
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,236
Very satisfactory indeed.

607
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,840
We got wHat we came for

608
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,270
and our special relationsHip
is still very special.

609
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,754
Prime Minister?

610
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,157
I love tHat word "relationsHip".
Covers all manner of sins, doesn't it?

611
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,590
I fear tHat tHis Has become
a bad relationsHip.

612
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:35,679
A relationsHip based on
tHe President taking wHat He wants

613
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:40,555
and casually ignoring all tHose tHings
tHat really matter to, erm...

615

but we're a great one, too.

- David BeckHam's rigHt foot.

619
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,994
David BeckHam's left foot, come to tHat.

620
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:04,919
And a friend wHo bullies us
is no longer a friend.

621
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,077
And since bullies only respond to strengtH,
from now onward,

622
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:11,715
I will be prepared to be mucH stronger.

623
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,911
And tHe President
sHould be prepared for tHat.

629
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,470

00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:46,115
- You can't always be sensible.
- 'You can if you're Prime Minister.'

631

- It's tHe CHancellor on tHe otHer line.
- It isn't!

- 'I'll call you back.'
- No, you won't!

633

THe trouble witH being tHe Prime Minister's
