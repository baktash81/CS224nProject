00:00:31,441 --> 00:00:34,600
<i>Let us tell an old story anew,</i>

2
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:38,469
<i>and we will see how
well you know it.</i>

3
00:00:38,761 --> 00:00:40,240
<i>Once upon a time,</i>

4
00:00:40,241 --> 00:00:43,640
<i>there were two kingdoms that
were the worst of neighbors.</i>

5
00:00:43,641 --> 00:00:46,640
<i>So vast was the discord between them</i>

6
00:00:46,641 --> 00:00:49,360
<i>that it was said only a great hero</i>

7
00:00:49,361 --> 00:00:52,720
<i>or a terrible villain might
bring them together.</i>

8
00:00:52,721 --> 00:00:56,080
<i>In one kingdom lived
folk like you and me,</i>

9
00:00:56,081 --> 00:00:59,983
<i>with a vain and greedy
king to rule over them.</i>

10
00:01:00,201 --> 00:01:02,160
<i>They were forever discontent,</i>

11
00:01:02,161 --> 00:01:05,790
<i>and envious of the wealth
and beauty of their neighbors.</i>

12
00:01:06,241 --> 00:01:08,880
<i>For in the other kingdom, the Moors,</i>

13
00:01:08,881 --> 00:01:13,511
<i>lived every manner of strange
and wonderful creature.</i>

14
00:01:13,801 --> 00:01:16,360
<i>And they needed neither
king nor queen,</i>

15
00:01:16,361 --> 00:01:18,511
<i>but trusted in one another.</i>

16
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:24,320
<i>In a great tree on a
great cliff in the Moors</i>

17
00:01:24,321 --> 00:01:26,800
<i>lived one such spirit.</i>

18
00:01:26,801 --> 00:01:30,271
<i>You might take her for a girl,</i>

19
00:01:30,281 --> 00:01:33,864
<i>but she was not just any girl.</i>

20
00:01:34,001 --> 00:01:36,868
<i>She was a fairy.</i>

21
00:02:04,201 --> 00:02:06,226
There you go.

22
00:02:06,721 --> 00:02:08,600
<i>And her name</i>

23
00:02:08,601 --> 00:02:10,466
<i>was Maleficent.</i>

24
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:22,040
Good morning, Mr. Chanterelle!

25
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,191
I love your cap!

26
00:02:29,241 --> 00:02:31,664
No. No, don't do it!

27
00:02:36,561 --> 00:02:38,062
You missed me!

28
00:02:39,241 --> 00:02:41,709
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

29
00:02:48,921 --> 00:02:50,991
Lovely work, girls!

30
00:03:07,681 --> 00:03:08,880
What's all the fuss about?

31
00:03:08,881 --> 00:03:09,960
The border guards have discov...

32
00:03:09,961 --> 00:03:11,280
Why do you get to tell her?
I want to tell her!

33
00:03:11,281 --> 00:03:12,320
I want to!

34
00:03:12,321 --> 00:03:15,320
There are rules, Flittle. I tell
this time, you tell next time.

35
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:16,720
No, you told last time,

36
00:03:16,721 --> 00:03:18,950
so I should tell this time,
and Thistlewit next time.

37
00:03:19,201 --> 00:03:20,520
Tell me what?

38
00:03:20,521 --> 00:03:21,960
Fine!

39
00:03:21,961 --> 00:03:23,462
Thank you.

40
00:03:23,681 --> 00:03:24,960
Maleficent, the border guard...

41
00:03:24,961 --> 00:03:28,829
The border guards have found a
human thief at the pool of jewels.

42
00:03:30,481 --> 00:03:32,312
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:36,561 --> 00:03:39,348
She's always in a hurry,
with her big wings.

44
00:03:39,361 --> 00:03:43,024
Humans, here. I hope
there's not another war.

45
00:03:54,641 --> 00:03:56,480
I'm not afraid.

46
00:03:56,481 --> 00:04:00,349
Besides, I have never
seen a human up close.

47
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:02,502
Come out!

48
00:04:02,521 --> 00:04:05,440
No. They mean to kill me.

49
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:08,421
And besides, they're
hideous to look at.

50
00:04:09,401 --> 00:04:11,471
That's extremely rude.

51
00:04:11,721 --> 00:04:15,509
Don't listen to him, Balthazar.
You're classically handsome.

52
00:04:17,681 --> 00:04:19,520
It's not right to steal,

53
00:04:19,521 --> 00:04:21,680
but we don't kill people for it.

54
00:04:21,681 --> 00:04:23,200
Come out.

55
00:04:23,201 --> 00:04:25,112
Come out this instant!

56
00:04:37,321 --> 00:04:39,107
Are you fully grown?

57
00:04:39,521 --> 00:04:41,022
No.

58
00:04:41,641 --> 00:04:44,303
I believe he's just a boy.

59
00:04:44,361 --> 00:04:46,465
And you're just a girl.

60
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,240
I think.

61
00:04:48,241 --> 00:04:49,742
Who are you?

62
00:04:49,881 --> 00:04:51,746
I'm called Stefan.

63
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,542
Who are you?

64
00:04:53,681 --> 00:04:55,262
I'm Maleficent.

65
00:04:58,481 --> 00:05:00,312
Yes, right.

66
00:05:01,241 --> 00:05:02,902
You have to give it back.

67
00:05:03,321 --> 00:05:04,947
Give what back?

68
00:05:25,561 --> 00:05:29,320
If I knew you would throw it
away, I would have kept it.

69
00:05:29,321 --> 00:05:31,080
I didn't throw it away.

70
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:34,585
I delivered it home,
as I'm going to do for you.

71
00:05:38,441 --> 00:05:41,080
Someday, you know, I'll live there.

72
00:05:41,081 --> 00:05:43,390
In the castle.

73
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:48,466
Where do you live now?

74
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:51,142
In a barn.

75
00:05:51,361 --> 00:05:53,625
So your parents are farmers, then?

76
00:05:54,281 --> 00:05:56,783
My parents are dead.

77
00:05:58,641 --> 00:06:00,267
Mine, too.

78
00:06:04,321 --> 00:06:06,080
We'll see each other again.

79
00:06:06,081 --> 00:06:08,600
You really shouldn't come
back here, you know.

80
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:10,671
It's not safe.

81
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:14,880
And if I made that choice,

82
00:06:14,881 --> 00:06:17,270
if I came back, would you be here?

83
00:06:18,761 --> 00:06:20,308
Perhaps.

84
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:26,105
- What's wrong?
- Your ring.

85
00:06:26,481 --> 00:06:28,360
Iron burns fairies.

86
00:06:28,361 --> 00:06:29,908
I'm sorry.

87
00:06:36,801 --> 00:06:38,985
I like your wings.

88
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:44,320
<i>Maleficent thought of how
Stefan cast away his ring,</i>

89
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,800
<i>he who had so little in the world,</i>

90
00:06:46,801 --> 00:06:49,269
<i>so that their hands
might touch again,</i>

91
00:06:49,721 --> 00:06:52,840
<i>and her heart was moved.</i>

92
00:06:52,841 --> 00:06:56,000
<i>Thus did the young thief who
had hoped to steal a jewel...</i>

93
00:06:56,001 --> 00:06:57,080
Maleficent!

94
00:06:57,081 --> 00:06:59,960
<i>steal something far more precious.</i>

95
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,031
Maleficent?

96
00:07:04,361 --> 00:07:06,067
Maleficent!

97
00:07:10,361 --> 00:07:12,000
After all these weeks,

98
00:07:12,001 --> 00:07:13,991
look who came back.

99
00:07:15,481 --> 00:07:17,983
I thought it worth the risk.

100
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:20,908
So, what do you do for fun?

101
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:34,626
<i>Stefan and Maleficent became
the most unlikely of friends.</i>

102
00:07:34,681 --> 00:07:38,720
<i>And for a time it seemed
as if, in them at least,</i>

103
00:07:38,721 --> 00:07:43,306
<i>the old hatred between men and
fairies had been forgotten.</i>

104
00:07:43,761 --> 00:07:48,391
<i>As it will, friendship slowly
turned into something else.</i>

105
00:07:54,921 --> 00:07:57,400
<i>And on her 16th birthday,</i>

106
00:07:57,401 --> 00:08:00,268
<i>Stefan gave Maleficent a gift.</i>

107
00:08:02,121 --> 00:08:05,227
<i>He told her it was true love's kiss.</i>

108
00:08:07,881 --> 00:08:10,349
<i>But it was not to be.</i>

109
00:08:11,921 --> 00:08:16,800
<i>As the years passed, Stefan's ambition
pulled him away from Maleficent,</i>

110
00:08:16,801 --> 00:08:21,101
<i>and towards the temptations
of the human kingdom.</i>

111
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:24,280
<i>While Maleficent,
the strongest of the fairies,</i>

112
00:08:24,281 --> 00:08:27,751
<i>rose to become the
protector of the Moors.</i>

113
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,160
<i>Maleficent often wandered alone</i>

114
00:09:17,161 --> 00:09:20,640
<i>and sometimes wondered
where Stefan might be,</i>

115
00:09:20,641 --> 00:09:24,543
<i>for she had never understood
the greed and envy of men.</i>

116
00:09:25,281 --> 00:09:27,749
<i>But she was to learn.</i>

117
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:32,160
<i>For the human king had heard
of a growing power in the Moors,</i>

118
00:09:32,161 --> 00:09:35,585
<i>and he sought to strike it down.</i>

119
00:09:56,121 --> 00:09:58,464
Guard, halt!

120
00:09:59,001 --> 00:10:01,151
Guard, halt!

121
00:10:11,761 --> 00:10:13,706
There they are,

122
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:18,200
the mysterious Moors where
no one dares to venture

123
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:22,023
for fear of the magical
creatures that lurk within.

124
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,623
Well, I say crush them!

125
00:10:44,121 --> 00:10:46,749
Go no further!

126
00:10:48,001 --> 00:10:49,640
A king

127
00:10:49,641 --> 00:10:53,782
does not take orders
from a winged elf.

128
00:10:56,241 --> 00:10:59,824
You are no king to me.

129
00:11:05,961 --> 00:11:08,748
- Bring me her head.
- Battalion!

130
00:11:12,721 --> 00:11:14,302
Advance!

131
00:11:19,601 --> 00:11:21,944
Arise and stand with me!

132
00:11:27,281 --> 00:11:29,271
Hold the line!

133
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:44,547
- It's the dark creatures!
- It's the dark creatures!

134
00:12:05,361 --> 00:12:08,148
Charge!

135
00:13:05,121 --> 00:13:06,702
You!

136
00:13:10,201 --> 00:13:11,907
To the king!

137
00:13:18,761 --> 00:13:20,440
You will not have the Moors!

138
00:13:20,441 --> 00:13:22,864
Not now, nor ever!

139
00:13:22,881 --> 00:13:24,382
You...

140
00:14:02,561 --> 00:14:05,507
When I ascended to the throne,

141
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:09,747
I promised the people

142
00:14:09,801 --> 00:14:12,986
one day we would take

143
00:14:13,441 --> 00:14:16,421
the Moors and its treasures.

144
00:14:17,121 --> 00:14:19,111
Each of you

145
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:24,782
swore allegiance to
me and to that cause.

146
00:14:30,801 --> 00:14:32,382
Your Majesty.

147
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:38,269
Defeated in battle.

148
00:14:38,361 --> 00:14:41,990
Is this to be my legacy?

149
00:14:42,121 --> 00:14:46,148
I see you waiting for me to die.

150
00:14:46,441 --> 00:14:50,070
It won't be long. But what then?

151
00:14:50,121 --> 00:14:52,510
I will choose a successor

152
00:14:52,721 --> 00:14:56,350
to take the throne and
care for my daughter.

153
00:14:57,401 --> 00:14:59,107
Who among you

154
00:14:59,521 --> 00:15:01,830
is worthy?

155
00:15:02,281 --> 00:15:05,400
Kill the winged creature.

156
00:15:05,401 --> 00:15:07,560
Avenge me,

157
00:15:07,561 --> 00:15:11,827
and upon my death you
will take the crown.

158
00:15:38,801 --> 00:15:41,030
Maleficent.

159
00:15:41,601 --> 00:15:44,069
Maleficent!

160
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:54,711
So, how is life with the humans?

161
00:15:57,161 --> 00:16:00,680
Maleficent, I've come to warn you.

162
00:16:00,681 --> 00:16:02,706
They mean to kill you.

163
00:16:03,481 --> 00:16:06,268
King Henry will stop at nothing.

164
00:16:08,321 --> 00:16:12,064
Please, you have to trust me.

165
00:16:15,401 --> 00:16:17,760
<i>They spoke of many things,</i>

166
00:16:17,761 --> 00:16:20,025
<i>and the years faded away.</i>

167
00:16:20,881 --> 00:16:25,830
<i>And she forgave Stefan
his folly and his ambition,</i>

168
00:16:25,921 --> 00:16:29,664
<i>and all was as it had been long ago.</i>

169
00:16:32,081 --> 00:16:33,867
You thirsty?

170
00:17:08,321 --> 00:17:10,152
Maleficent?

171
00:19:25,561 --> 00:19:27,062
What is this?

172
00:19:29,681 --> 00:19:32,422
I have avenged you, sire.

173
00:19:33,761 --> 00:19:36,263
She is vanquished?

174
00:19:38,681 --> 00:19:41,149
You have done well, my son.

175
00:19:41,241 --> 00:19:43,948
You have done what
others feared to do.

176
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:47,103
You will be rewarded.

177
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:53,831
I shall do my best to
be a worthy successor,

178
00:19:54,161 --> 00:19:56,106
Your Majesty.

179
00:22:07,401 --> 00:22:09,551
I've got you!

180
00:22:13,481 --> 00:22:16,029
- You wicked bird!
- Into a man.

181
00:22:17,201 --> 00:22:19,032
It's a...

182
00:22:29,561 --> 00:22:31,347
It's a demon!

183
00:22:44,601 --> 00:22:47,240
What have you done
to my beautiful self?

184
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:49,709
Would you rather I let
them beat you to death?

185
00:22:51,081 --> 00:22:52,480
I'm not certain.

186
00:22:52,481 --> 00:22:54,585
Stop complaining.

187
00:22:54,641 --> 00:22:56,791
I saved your life.

188
00:22:59,361 --> 00:23:01,226
Forgive me.

189
00:23:01,641 --> 00:23:03,267
What do I call you?

190
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:05,271
Diaval.

191
00:23:05,441 --> 00:23:09,104
And in return for saving my
life, I am your servant.

192
00:23:09,601 --> 00:23:11,671
Whatever you need.

193
00:23:12,601 --> 00:23:14,227
Wings.

194
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:17,830
I need you to be my wings.

195
00:23:36,801 --> 00:23:40,160
I present to you the
first of his line,

196
00:23:40,161 --> 00:23:44,063
His Royal Highness King Stefan.

197
00:24:06,521 --> 00:24:11,265
He did this to me so
he would be king.

198
00:24:30,961 --> 00:24:33,111
Now what, Mistress?

199
00:25:11,001 --> 00:25:13,265
Her wings!

200
00:26:00,321 --> 00:26:01,982
It's a girl!

201
00:26:02,161 --> 00:26:04,425
It's a girl! It's a girl!

202
00:26:27,321 --> 00:26:28,868
Well?

203
00:26:29,401 --> 00:26:31,360
Well, I saw nothing.

204
00:26:31,361 --> 00:26:34,102
But there's been a...

205
00:26:34,281 --> 00:26:35,782
What?

206
00:26:37,761 --> 00:26:39,422
Child.

207
00:26:40,841 --> 00:26:44,185
King Stefan and the
Queen have had a child.

208
00:26:48,521 --> 00:26:51,183
There will be a christening.

209
00:26:51,481 --> 00:26:53,710
They say it's to be a
grand celebration.

210
00:26:55,121 --> 00:27:00,183
A grand celebration for a baby.

211
00:27:01,001 --> 00:27:04,027
How wonderful.

212
00:27:19,561 --> 00:27:22,880
<i>All manner of folk came
to the christening,</i>

213
00:27:22,881 --> 00:27:27,240
<i>even a trio of fairies who sought
to foster peace and goodwill.</i>

214
00:27:27,241 --> 00:27:29,280
Look, there's the baby!

215
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:30,600
I love babies!

216
00:27:30,601 --> 00:27:34,230
Can you just concentrate, please?
I'm not telling you again.

217
00:27:41,281 --> 00:27:44,080
Greetings, Your Majesty.

218
00:27:44,081 --> 00:27:46,880
I am Knotgrass of the
Moorland Fair Folk.

219
00:27:46,881 --> 00:27:48,840
I'm Flittle, Your Kingship.

220
00:27:48,841 --> 00:27:51,867
And I'm Thistlewit,
Your Royalnesses.

221
00:27:52,881 --> 00:27:54,951
They bring gifts for our daughter.

222
00:27:55,721 --> 00:28:00,829
These are not just any old gifts,
for, you see, we're magic!

223
00:28:00,881 --> 00:28:02,871
And very good with children.

224
00:28:06,281 --> 00:28:08,431
Very well.

225
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:15,360
Sweet Aurora, I wish for you

226
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:18,546
the gift of beauty.

227
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:27,120
My wish is that you
will never be blue,

228
00:28:27,121 --> 00:28:31,307
only happy, all the
days of your life.

229
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:38,585
Sweet baby,

230
00:28:38,881 --> 00:28:42,066
my wish for you is that you find...

231
00:29:03,001 --> 00:29:05,822
- Maleficent!
- Maleficent!

232
00:29:16,801 --> 00:29:19,110
Well, well.

233
00:29:23,241 --> 00:29:27,541
What a glittering
assemblage, King Stefan.

234
00:29:31,361 --> 00:29:37,345
Royalty, nobility,
the gentry, and...

235
00:29:39,241 --> 00:29:40,947
How quaint.

236
00:29:42,801 --> 00:29:45,224
Even the rabble.

237
00:29:51,881 --> 00:29:54,065
I must say

238
00:29:54,081 --> 00:29:59,382
I really felt quite distressed
at not receiving an invitation.

239
00:29:59,561 --> 00:30:01,631
You're not welcome here.

240
00:30:10,561 --> 00:30:12,187
Oh, dear.

241
00:30:12,321 --> 00:30:14,880
What an awkward situation.

242
00:30:14,881 --> 00:30:16,906
You're not offended?

243
00:30:17,921 --> 00:30:20,662
Why, no.

244
00:30:22,561 --> 00:30:26,560
And to show I bear no ill will,

245
00:30:26,561 --> 00:30:31,120
I, too, shall bestow
a gift on the child.

246
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:33,111
No! We don't want your gift!

247
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:38,160
Stay away from the princess!

248
00:30:38,161 --> 00:30:40,663
Yes, stay away!

249
00:30:57,441 --> 00:30:59,480
Listen well, all of you.

250
00:30:59,481 --> 00:31:02,461
<i>Listen well, all of you.</i>

251
00:31:02,481 --> 00:31:08,784
The princess shall indeed
grow in grace and beauty,

252
00:31:08,881 --> 00:31:12,510
beloved by all who meet her.

253
00:31:12,641 --> 00:31:14,552
That's a lovely gift.

254
00:31:18,241 --> 00:31:19,981
Don't do this.

255
00:31:35,241 --> 00:31:36,867
But

256
00:31:38,481 --> 00:31:43,782
before the sun sets
on her 16th birthday,

257
00:31:44,001 --> 00:31:47,960
she will prick her finger on the
spindle of a spinning wheel

258
00:31:47,961 --> 00:31:50,907
and fall into a sleep like death,

259
00:31:51,281 --> 00:31:55,991
a sleep from which she
will never awaken.

260
00:31:56,561 --> 00:31:59,587
Maleficent, please don't
do this, I'm begging you.

261
00:32:01,361 --> 00:32:03,784
I like you begging.

262
00:32:05,361 --> 00:32:07,511
Do it again.

263
00:32:25,281 --> 00:32:26,987
I beg you.

264
00:32:28,801 --> 00:32:30,666
All right.

265
00:32:34,521 --> 00:32:39,788
The princess can be woken
from her death sleep,

266
00:32:40,561 --> 00:32:43,189
but only by

267
00:32:43,721 --> 00:32:46,383
true love's kiss.

268
00:32:48,361 --> 00:32:51,387
This curse will last
till the end of time!

269
00:32:51,401 --> 00:32:54,552
No power on Earth can change it.

270
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:11,640
<i>King Stefan ordered his men</i>

271
00:33:11,641 --> 00:33:14,760
<i>to seize every spinning
wheel in the kingdom.</i>

272
00:33:14,761 --> 00:33:19,400
<i>The wheels were broken and burned,
that they might never be used,</i>

273
00:33:19,401 --> 00:33:23,872
<i>and thrown into the deepest
dungeon in the castle.</i>

274
00:33:24,401 --> 00:33:27,560
<i>Secretly, he entrusted
the safety of the child</i>

275
00:33:27,561 --> 00:33:29,920
<i>to the magic of the pixies,</i>

276
00:33:29,921 --> 00:33:35,791
<i>who would take her to a remote
hideaway for 16 years and a day.</i>

277
00:33:39,481 --> 00:33:43,702
<i>Stefan shut himself behind
the walls of his castle</i>

278
00:33:43,761 --> 00:33:49,870
<i>while his soldiers rode far and
wide to hunt Maleficent down.</i>

279
00:33:50,481 --> 00:33:53,280
<i>But she made walls of her own,</i>

280
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:56,800
<i>that the Moors might never
again suffer the touch</i>

281
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:59,303
<i>of any human.</i>

282
00:34:00,721 --> 00:34:06,466
<i>And she reveled in the sorrow
that her curse had brought.</i>

283
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:12,720
<i>The fairies began their charge</i>

284
00:34:12,721 --> 00:34:17,192
<i>to raise Aurora in a snug
little cottage in the woods.</i>

285
00:34:17,241 --> 00:34:20,472
No! Is this it?

286
00:34:20,601 --> 00:34:22,640
Looks dreadful.

287
00:34:22,641 --> 00:34:24,666
Come on.

288
00:34:25,601 --> 00:34:27,080
We need a smaller...

289
00:34:27,081 --> 00:34:28,280
Baby.

290
00:34:28,281 --> 00:34:30,080
Or bigger bodies.

291
00:34:30,081 --> 00:34:33,720
No, what we need is
a proper disguise.

292
00:34:33,721 --> 00:34:35,160
What do you mean?

293
00:34:35,161 --> 00:34:37,360
Well, we have to blend in, don't we?

294
00:34:37,361 --> 00:34:39,625
We have to be big enough
to look after this baby.

295
00:34:39,921 --> 00:34:43,470
So, gather around, ladies.

296
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:47,503
Get ready. One, two, three, grow!

297
00:34:51,241 --> 00:34:53,982
That's worked quite well.
That's very nice.

298
00:34:54,841 --> 00:34:56,680
Now, there will be
no questions asked.

299
00:34:56,681 --> 00:34:57,880
We are no longer fairies.

300
00:34:57,881 --> 00:35:00,520
We are three peasant women raising
our orphan child in the woods.

301
00:35:00,521 --> 00:35:03,560
- Yes.
- So, no more flying.

302
00:35:03,561 --> 00:35:07,560
- No flying?
- No, no, and no magic.

303
00:35:07,561 --> 00:35:09,000
- No magic?
- Yes, you heard.

304
00:35:09,001 --> 00:35:10,200
It's in the middle of nowhere.

305
00:35:10,201 --> 00:35:13,181
At least no one will find us here.

306
00:35:19,521 --> 00:35:23,200
There you are. Why are
you always hiding?

307
00:35:23,201 --> 00:35:25,703
Come on. There you go.

308
00:35:43,881 --> 00:35:47,863
It's so ugly, you could
almost feel sorry for it.

309
00:35:57,201 --> 00:35:59,988
I hate you. Beasty.

310
00:36:06,201 --> 00:36:09,272
<i>The fairies were perhaps
unequal to their task.</i>

311
00:36:10,721 --> 00:36:12,200
Why is she crying?

312
00:36:12,201 --> 00:36:14,066
I think she might be hungry.

313
00:36:14,921 --> 00:36:16,752
Then feed her!

314
00:36:26,361 --> 00:36:29,640
There you are.

315
00:36:29,641 --> 00:36:31,381
There you go.

316
00:36:37,321 --> 00:36:40,506
It's going to starve with
those three looking after it.

317
00:36:53,121 --> 00:36:55,271
It tickles.

318
00:37:23,081 --> 00:37:25,280
- What?
- You're cheating.

319
00:37:25,281 --> 00:37:26,840
I saw that!

320
00:37:26,841 --> 00:37:29,120
- We're starting again.
- Suit yourself.

321
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:32,431
Greedy, bloated goat!

322
00:37:34,401 --> 00:37:36,471
"Bloated goat."

323
00:37:39,921 --> 00:37:41,661
Stop doing that.

324
00:37:42,081 --> 00:37:44,106
I'm not doing anything.

325
00:37:45,801 --> 00:37:47,400
Well, someone is.

326
00:37:47,401 --> 00:37:48,520
It's not me.

327
00:37:48,521 --> 00:37:52,548
You two are having a go at me,
and I will not tolerate...

328
00:37:53,761 --> 00:37:55,467
Stop it!

329
00:38:06,161 --> 00:38:07,662
Why...

330
00:38:12,401 --> 00:38:14,710
No!

331
00:38:14,761 --> 00:38:16,501
This is all your fault!

332
00:38:27,401 --> 00:38:29,551
Come on. That's funny.

333
00:38:31,441 --> 00:38:34,720
<i>As the days went on,
Stefan darkened,</i>

334
00:38:34,721 --> 00:38:38,240
<i>further consumed by
paranoia and vengeance.</i>

335
00:38:38,241 --> 00:38:41,080
- Burn it all down!
- Yes, sir!

336
00:38:41,081 --> 00:38:42,946
Flame!

337
00:38:45,241 --> 00:38:46,742
Release!

338
00:39:20,481 --> 00:39:22,392
Run!

339
00:39:35,121 --> 00:39:36,622
You failed me.

340
00:39:37,961 --> 00:39:42,625
The wall cannot be burned.
It is indestructible.

341
00:39:47,281 --> 00:39:50,022
Nothing is indestructible!

342
00:39:50,481 --> 00:39:55,305
Not the wall! Not Maleficent!
Not even her curse!

343
00:40:13,201 --> 00:40:15,783
Bring me the iron workers.

344
00:40:39,841 --> 00:40:41,422
You!

345
00:40:52,601 --> 00:40:54,227
Look.

346
00:40:54,321 --> 00:40:58,143
The little beast is about
to fall off the cliff.

347
00:41:23,641 --> 00:41:25,222
What?

348
00:41:43,401 --> 00:41:45,710
Hello.

349
00:41:57,161 --> 00:41:58,708
Go away.

350
00:41:59,001 --> 00:42:00,627
Go.

351
00:42:00,841 --> 00:42:02,342
Go away.

352
00:42:04,281 --> 00:42:06,783
I don't like children.

353
00:42:08,961 --> 00:42:11,145
Up, up.

354
00:42:28,801 --> 00:42:31,383
Go along. Go, go, go.

355
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,560
<i>As Maleficent had said,</i>

356
00:42:45,561 --> 00:42:49,827
<i>Aurora did grow in grace and beauty.</i>

357
00:42:52,561 --> 00:42:54,472
Pretty bird.

358
00:42:55,481 --> 00:42:59,781
<i>Far away from the lofty palace
that she remembered not.</i>

359
00:43:02,641 --> 00:43:07,351
<i>And as the seasons changed
and the flowers grew,</i>

360
00:43:07,561 --> 00:43:09,586
<i>so did she.</i>

361
00:43:23,161 --> 00:43:24,662
Hello.

362
00:43:25,161 --> 00:43:26,662
That's it.

363
00:43:32,041 --> 00:43:33,440
There you go.

364
00:43:33,441 --> 00:43:36,592
<i>She wondered at the world about her,</i>

365
00:43:40,401 --> 00:43:45,190
<i>and at what lay beyond the
fearsome wall of thorns.</i>

366
00:43:54,921 --> 00:43:57,423
Curious little beasty.

367
00:43:57,761 --> 00:44:01,583
<i>But she was not the only one
who wished to get through.</i>

368
00:44:04,641 --> 00:44:06,142
Look.

369
00:44:07,681 --> 00:44:12,550
- Is that her? Is that Maleficent?
- I don't know.

370
00:44:15,721 --> 00:44:17,666
Bring them to me.

371
00:44:21,521 --> 00:44:23,910
No, it's just a silly peasant girl.

372
00:44:47,961 --> 00:44:49,701
Steady.

373
00:45:16,521 --> 00:45:19,023
- It's her!
- It's her!

374
00:46:23,841 --> 00:46:25,200
How could you do that to me?

375
00:46:25,201 --> 00:46:27,320
You said anything I need.

376
00:46:27,321 --> 00:46:28,822
Yeah, but not a dog.

377
00:46:29,001 --> 00:46:31,026
It was a wolf, not a dog.

378
00:46:31,201 --> 00:46:32,827
It's the same thing.

379
00:46:32,921 --> 00:46:36,520
They're dirty, vicious,
and they hunt birds.

380
00:46:36,521 --> 00:46:39,840
Fine. Next time I'll turn
you into a mealy worm.

381
00:46:39,841 --> 00:46:43,902
Well, I'll be a mealy worm, gladly.
Anything but a filthy, stinking...

382
00:46:53,201 --> 00:46:55,271
I wonder.

383
00:48:36,641 --> 00:48:38,427
I know you're there.

384
00:48:38,481 --> 00:48:40,392
Don't be afraid.

385
00:48:43,561 --> 00:48:45,347
I am not afraid.

386
00:48:46,001 --> 00:48:48,185
Then come out.

387
00:48:48,681 --> 00:48:50,990
Then you'll be afraid.

388
00:48:51,281 --> 00:48:53,021
No, I won't.

389
00:49:09,601 --> 00:49:11,307
I know who you are.

390
00:49:12,521 --> 00:49:14,068
Do you?

391
00:49:15,921 --> 00:49:18,389
You're my Fairy Godmother.

392
00:49:20,721 --> 00:49:22,080
What?

393
00:49:22,081 --> 00:49:24,200
Fairy Godmother.

394
00:49:24,201 --> 00:49:27,068
You've been watching
over me my whole life.

395
00:49:27,201 --> 00:49:29,703
I've always known you were close by.

396
00:49:30,721 --> 00:49:31,920
How?

397
00:49:31,921 --> 00:49:36,400
Your shadow. It's been following
me ever since I was small.

398
00:49:36,401 --> 00:49:39,586
Wherever I went, your
shadow was always with me.

399
00:49:42,361 --> 00:49:44,067
I remember you.

400
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:46,426
Pretty bird.

401
00:49:47,681 --> 00:49:49,421
This is Diaval.

402
00:49:54,161 --> 00:49:55,662
Hello, Aurora.

403
00:49:57,561 --> 00:50:00,462
I have known you since
you were a little one.

404
00:50:07,041 --> 00:50:10,000
It's everything I
imagined it would be.

405
00:50:10,001 --> 00:50:13,584
It's just so beautiful!
I've always wanted to come...

406
00:51:00,961 --> 00:51:03,463
Good night, beasty.

407
00:51:15,601 --> 00:51:17,591
You mock me.

408
00:51:18,081 --> 00:51:20,902
I know what you're doing.

409
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:24,360
I know exactly what you're doing.

410
00:51:24,361 --> 00:51:25,840
Sire?

411
00:51:25,841 --> 00:51:28,628
Your presence has been
requested by the Queen.

412
00:51:28,801 --> 00:51:30,348
Leave me.

413
00:51:30,441 --> 00:51:32,625
Sire, she is not well.

414
00:51:32,641 --> 00:51:36,543
The nurses are fearful that she
won't make it through the night.

415
00:51:39,681 --> 00:51:43,549
Can you not see we're
having a conversation?

416
00:51:51,641 --> 00:51:54,680
When the curse fails,
Maleficent will come for me.

417
00:51:54,681 --> 00:51:58,742
And on that day, I will be ready.

418
00:52:12,841 --> 00:52:15,230
They're so beautiful.

419
00:53:30,121 --> 00:53:32,749
I revoke the curse.

420
00:53:33,641 --> 00:53:36,303
Let it be no more.

421
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:40,070
I revoke the curse.

422
00:53:40,321 --> 00:53:43,142
Let it be no more.

423
00:53:44,681 --> 00:53:46,880
I revoke my curse!

424
00:53:46,881 --> 00:53:50,066
Let it be no more!

425
00:53:50,321 --> 00:53:52,550
I revoke my curse!

426
00:53:52,921 --> 00:53:56,425
Let it be no more!

427
00:53:58,161 --> 00:54:01,426
Let it be no more!

428
00:54:08,881 --> 00:54:12,988
<i>This curse will last
till the end of time.</i>

429
00:54:13,561 --> 00:54:16,667
<i>No power on Earth can change it.</i>

430
00:54:38,081 --> 00:54:41,061
Do all the Fair People have wings?

431
00:54:43,081 --> 00:54:45,080
Most do.

432
00:54:45,081 --> 00:54:47,424
Then why don't you?

433
00:54:47,921 --> 00:54:50,503
All the other fairies fly.

434
00:54:52,121 --> 00:54:55,040
I had wings once.
They were stolen from me.

435
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:57,305
That's all I wish to say about it.

436
00:54:57,681 --> 00:54:59,785
What color were they?

437
00:55:00,201 --> 00:55:01,907
Were they big?

438
00:55:04,881 --> 00:55:08,544
So big they dragged
behind me when I walked.

439
00:55:09,601 --> 00:55:11,840
And they were strong.

440
00:55:11,841 --> 00:55:15,345
They could carry me above the
clouds and into the headwinds.

441
00:55:16,001 --> 00:55:20,711
And they never faltered,
not even once.

442
00:55:20,921 --> 00:55:22,661
I could trust them.

443
00:55:48,961 --> 00:55:52,431
She's coming. She's coming.

444
00:55:56,961 --> 00:55:58,508
Where are your workers?

445
00:55:59,801 --> 00:56:01,720
In their beds, Majesty.

446
00:56:01,721 --> 00:56:04,440
Get them back to work without delay.

447
00:56:04,441 --> 00:56:06,000
They're exhausted, sire.

448
00:56:06,001 --> 00:56:09,311
But I'll have them back
to work at first light.

449
00:56:10,721 --> 00:56:12,960
I need them back to work now.

450
00:56:12,961 --> 00:56:15,111
It's the wee hours.

451
00:56:17,961 --> 00:56:19,587
Aye.

452
00:56:20,721 --> 00:56:22,302
Aye.

453
00:56:23,121 --> 00:56:25,032
It is the wee hours.

454
00:56:27,041 --> 00:56:29,080
So wake them up.

455
00:56:29,081 --> 00:56:31,151
Sire?

456
00:56:31,801 --> 00:56:35,040
So wake them up, and get
them back to work now!

457
00:56:35,041 --> 00:56:38,590
We're running out of time! Go, now!

458
00:57:07,801 --> 00:57:09,382
Aurora?

459
00:57:10,161 --> 00:57:11,992
Come here.

460
00:57:21,081 --> 00:57:22,787
Sit.

461
00:57:27,001 --> 00:57:29,026
There's something
I need to tell you.

462
00:57:29,041 --> 00:57:30,986
What is it?

463
00:57:32,521 --> 00:57:35,706
There is an evil in this world,

464
00:57:36,441 --> 00:57:39,023
and I cannot keep you from it.

465
00:57:39,801 --> 00:57:42,520
I'm almost 16, Godmother.

466
00:57:42,521 --> 00:57:44,591
I can take care of myself.

467
00:57:44,641 --> 00:57:46,666
I understand.

468
00:57:48,881 --> 00:57:51,588
- But that's not what I have to tell you.
- I have a plan.

469
00:57:52,281 --> 00:57:53,680
When I'm older,

470
00:57:53,681 --> 00:57:56,752
I'm going to live here
in the Moors with you.

471
00:57:56,801 --> 00:57:59,429
Then we can look after each other.

472
00:58:04,801 --> 00:58:07,960
You don't have to wait
until you're older.

473
00:58:07,961 --> 00:58:09,667
You could live here now.

474
00:58:10,721 --> 00:58:12,905
Then I will.

475
00:58:13,201 --> 00:58:16,760
I'll sleep in a tree and
eat berries and black nuts

476
00:58:16,761 --> 00:58:19,912
and all the Fair People
will be my friends.

477
00:58:21,761 --> 00:58:24,263
I'll be happy here for
the rest of my life.

478
00:58:24,921 --> 00:58:27,788
I'm going to tell my
aunties tomorrow.

479
00:58:30,081 --> 00:58:32,185
Until tomorrow.

480
00:58:32,601 --> 00:58:34,307
I'm so excited!

481
00:58:50,961 --> 00:58:53,600
Aunties, I'm almost 16.

482
00:58:53,601 --> 00:58:55,760
I need a life of my own.

483
00:58:55,761 --> 00:58:59,390
No. I love you very much,

484
00:58:59,761 --> 00:59:01,751
but it's time to say goodbye.

485
00:59:01,801 --> 00:59:03,680
You've been very good to me,

486
00:59:03,681 --> 00:59:07,025
except the time you
accidentally fed me spiders.

487
00:59:11,681 --> 00:59:13,182
Hello.

488
00:59:15,361 --> 00:59:17,400
I'm sorry to bother you,

489
00:59:17,401 --> 00:59:19,040
but I'm on my way to
King Stefan's castle

490
00:59:19,041 --> 00:59:22,320
and I've become hopelessly lost.

491
00:59:22,321 --> 00:59:23,902
Can you help me?

492
00:59:24,481 --> 00:59:27,427
I'm sorry. That was my fault.
I rushed in too...

493
00:59:33,601 --> 00:59:35,546
Forgive me.

494
00:59:38,161 --> 00:59:40,345
It's that way.

495
00:59:44,001 --> 00:59:45,991
The castle.

496
00:59:51,441 --> 00:59:53,181
What's your name?

497
00:59:53,201 --> 00:59:54,941
It's Philip.

498
00:59:56,361 --> 00:59:58,067
Hello, Philip.

499
00:59:59,001 --> 01:00:00,832
What's yours?

500
01:00:01,561 --> 01:00:03,392
Aurora.

501
01:00:04,481 --> 01:00:06,745
Hello, Aurora.

502
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:13,160
Well, it was nice meeting you.

503
01:00:13,161 --> 01:00:17,347
And once again, my apologies
for being such a clumsy fool.

504
01:00:18,841 --> 01:00:20,200
You're forgiven.

505
01:00:20,201 --> 01:00:22,305
That's good.

506
01:00:24,801 --> 01:00:26,712
I'd best be off, then.

507
01:00:27,881 --> 01:00:29,746
Good bye.

508
01:00:40,761 --> 01:00:43,263
Will you be back this way?

509
01:00:44,521 --> 01:00:46,386
Nothing could stop me.

510
01:00:47,881 --> 01:00:49,746
Then I'll see you soon.

511
01:00:50,081 --> 01:00:51,912
Very soon.

512
01:00:52,401 --> 01:00:56,144
- Goodbye, Philip.
- Goodbye, for now.

513
01:01:05,521 --> 01:01:07,864
Stop doing that.

514
01:01:12,881 --> 01:01:14,746
Well?

515
01:01:14,841 --> 01:01:16,752
That boy's the answer.

516
01:01:18,201 --> 01:01:20,480
- No, Diaval.
- Yes!

517
01:01:20,481 --> 01:01:23,000
True love's kiss, remember?
It can break the spell.

518
01:01:23,001 --> 01:01:25,400
True love's kiss?

519
01:01:25,401 --> 01:01:27,665
Have you not worked it out yet?

520
01:01:28,721 --> 01:01:32,430
I cursed her that way because
there is no such thing.

521
01:01:33,441 --> 01:01:35,909
Well, that might be how you feel,

522
01:01:36,441 --> 01:01:38,102
but what about Aurora?

523
01:01:39,841 --> 01:01:42,264
That boy could be her only chance.

524
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:45,261
It's her fate, anyway.

525
01:01:46,961 --> 01:01:48,520
Go ahead.

526
01:01:48,521 --> 01:01:50,800
Turn me into whatever you want.

527
01:01:50,801 --> 01:01:52,280
A bird, a worm.

528
01:01:52,281 --> 01:01:54,670
I don't care anymore.

529
01:02:00,841 --> 01:02:03,503
I'm so happy we're leaving tomorrow.

530
01:02:04,321 --> 01:02:06,360
We are not leaving tomorrow.

531
01:02:06,361 --> 01:02:08,800
Tomorrow is Aurora's 16th birthday.

532
01:02:08,801 --> 01:02:12,800
And Stefan told us to take her
back the day after her birthday.

533
01:02:12,801 --> 01:02:16,120
No. He said on her birthday.

534
01:02:16,121 --> 01:02:18,480
No. The day after her birthday.

535
01:02:18,481 --> 01:02:20,471
- On.
- After.

536
01:02:21,081 --> 01:02:22,787
- On.
- After.

537
01:02:22,921 --> 01:02:25,264
- On, on, on!
- After, after, after!

538
01:02:26,321 --> 01:02:28,505
Stop it!

539
01:02:32,961 --> 01:02:34,508
What?

540
01:02:36,161 --> 01:02:38,026
How could you?

541
01:02:41,601 --> 01:02:43,920
I need to talk to you
about something.

542
01:02:43,921 --> 01:02:46,662
Yes, sweetie, what is it?

543
01:02:52,521 --> 01:02:54,830
I'm sorry to have to tell you this,

544
01:02:55,121 --> 01:02:57,464
but I'll be 16 tomorrow.

545
01:02:58,001 --> 01:02:59,627
Yes.

546
01:03:07,921 --> 01:03:09,468
I'm leaving home.

547
01:03:13,801 --> 01:03:15,400
See here, young lady.

548
01:03:15,401 --> 01:03:19,280
I did not spend 16 years
in this miserable hovel

549
01:03:19,281 --> 01:03:21,021
with these two imbeciles...

550
01:03:21,481 --> 01:03:23,880
So that you could ruin
it on the last day.

551
01:03:23,881 --> 01:03:26,827
We are taking you back
to your father with...

552
01:03:27,241 --> 01:03:29,072
My father?

553
01:03:30,401 --> 01:03:32,903
You told me my parents were dead.

554
01:03:35,241 --> 01:03:38,711
I think you better
come and sit down.

555
01:03:51,561 --> 01:03:53,984
Fairy Godmother!

556
01:03:54,881 --> 01:03:56,712
I'm here.

557
01:03:57,761 --> 01:04:00,946
When were you going to
tell me that I'm cursed?

558
01:04:05,521 --> 01:04:07,261
Is it true?

559
01:04:09,801 --> 01:04:11,507
It is.

560
01:04:13,321 --> 01:04:16,520
My aunts said it was an evil fairy.

561
01:04:16,521 --> 01:04:19,786
I... I can't remember her name.

562
01:04:20,081 --> 01:04:22,026
They said

563
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:24,080
it was...

564
01:04:24,081 --> 01:04:26,106
Maleficent.

565
01:04:37,081 --> 01:04:39,151
Is that you?

566
01:04:42,721 --> 01:04:45,189
Are you Maleficent?

567
01:04:48,041 --> 01:04:49,781
No!

568
01:04:49,881 --> 01:04:51,826
Don't touch me.

569
01:04:52,041 --> 01:04:54,225
You're the evil that's in the world.

570
01:04:55,041 --> 01:04:56,952
It's you!

571
01:05:05,481 --> 01:05:07,142
Find the boy!

572
01:05:24,321 --> 01:05:27,520
I need every available man
on the east wing now.

573
01:05:27,521 --> 01:05:30,760
There should be no guards at the
gate. I want her to walk right in.

574
01:05:30,761 --> 01:05:32,786
Sorry to disturb, Your Majesty.

575
01:05:34,721 --> 01:05:37,064
We found this urchin at the gate.

576
01:05:37,201 --> 01:05:39,749
She claims to be the princess.

577
01:05:45,121 --> 01:05:46,520
Father.

578
01:05:46,521 --> 01:05:48,910
It's me, Aurora!

579
01:05:59,321 --> 01:06:02,142
You look just like your mother.

580
01:06:04,321 --> 01:06:06,520
They brought you
back a day too soon.

581
01:06:06,521 --> 01:06:08,720
I told those three idiots!

582
01:06:08,721 --> 01:06:11,040
Lock her up in her room.

583
01:06:11,041 --> 01:06:12,667
Go.

584
01:06:12,881 --> 01:06:15,987
Prepare the men.
Maleficent's coming.

585
01:06:16,401 --> 01:06:19,711
It's so good to be small again!

586
01:06:19,841 --> 01:06:21,560
Look at my feet!

587
01:06:21,561 --> 01:06:24,120
I love my tiny little feet!

588
01:06:24,121 --> 01:06:27,240
Pay attention!
We have to find Aurora,

589
01:06:27,241 --> 01:06:30,221
or the king will have our heads!

590
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:01,422
<i>Aurora.</i>

591
01:07:11,761 --> 01:07:13,672
Wait!

592
01:07:15,361 --> 01:07:17,306
Princess?

593
01:07:24,641 --> 01:07:26,506
I'm looking for a girl.

594
01:07:26,601 --> 01:07:28,751
Of course you are.

595
01:07:32,801 --> 01:07:34,985
I need a horse.

596
01:07:51,321 --> 01:07:56,145
<i>into a sleep like death.</i>

597
01:08:00,681 --> 01:08:02,990
<i>Aurora.</i>

598
01:08:06,201 --> 01:08:07,702
Come on, Diaval!

599
01:08:19,921 --> 01:08:21,991
<i>Aurora.</i>

600
01:08:55,681 --> 01:08:57,865
Faster, Diaval, faster!

601
01:09:00,041 --> 01:09:05,547
<i>She will prick her finger on the
spindle of a spinning wheel</i>

602
01:09:05,681 --> 01:09:08,149
<i>and fall into a sleep like death.</i>

603
01:09:09,961 --> 01:09:12,589
<i>No power on Earth...</i>

604
01:09:13,761 --> 01:09:16,992
<i>A sleep like death.</i>

605
01:09:35,041 --> 01:09:36,781
It's done.

606
01:10:06,681 --> 01:10:10,310
They pulled the guards.
He's waiting for you in there.

607
01:10:10,641 --> 01:10:13,826
If we go inside those walls,
we'll never come out alive.

608
01:10:15,881 --> 01:10:19,624
Then don't come.
It's not your fight.

609
01:10:23,601 --> 01:10:25,830
Thank you very much.

610
01:10:25,841 --> 01:10:30,391
"I need you, Diaval. I can't
do this without you, Diaval."

611
01:10:31,081 --> 01:10:33,106
I can hear you.

612
01:10:40,881 --> 01:10:42,542
Look at her.

613
01:10:43,641 --> 01:10:46,223
Look at what you've done.

614
01:10:47,761 --> 01:10:49,865
She's only sleeping.

615
01:10:52,841 --> 01:10:56,106
She's only sleeping, you say?

616
01:10:59,841 --> 01:11:02,025
She's only sleeping.

617
01:11:02,721 --> 01:11:06,111
She's only sleeping forever!

618
01:11:06,761 --> 01:11:10,231
- What about the kiss?
- Yes! True love's kiss!

619
01:11:12,881 --> 01:11:16,320
True love does not exist.

620
01:11:16,321 --> 01:11:19,222
But it's her only
chance, Your Majesty.

621
01:11:32,521 --> 01:11:34,352
Mistress.

622
01:12:38,601 --> 01:12:40,520
What are we going to do?

623
01:12:40,521 --> 01:12:43,080
We can't give up, can we?
Come on, girls.

624
01:12:43,081 --> 01:12:45,160
But we don't even
know where to start.

625
01:12:45,161 --> 01:12:48,187
True love doesn't just
fall from trees, you know.

626
01:12:59,801 --> 01:13:02,120
Pardon me.

627
01:13:02,121 --> 01:13:04,680
I'm embarrassed to say I
don't know where I am.

628
01:13:04,681 --> 01:13:07,343
In King Stefan's castle.

629
01:13:10,321 --> 01:13:12,311
This is where I'm meant to be.

630
01:13:12,721 --> 01:13:14,640
Odd that I can't
recall how I got here.

631
01:13:14,641 --> 01:13:15,960
Why have you come?

632
01:13:15,961 --> 01:13:17,640
My father sent me to see the King.

633
01:13:17,641 --> 01:13:18,960
Who is your father?

634
01:13:18,961 --> 01:13:20,701
King John of Ulstead.

635
01:13:20,881 --> 01:13:23,145
A prince!

636
01:13:33,801 --> 01:13:35,666
Aurora.

637
01:13:36,281 --> 01:13:38,670
He knows her.

638
01:13:39,841 --> 01:13:41,680
Why is she sleeping?

639
01:13:41,681 --> 01:13:44,000
She's trapped in an enchantment.

640
01:13:44,001 --> 01:13:46,663
Isn't she beautiful?

641
01:13:47,361 --> 01:13:50,387
The most beautiful
girl I've ever seen.

642
01:13:51,161 --> 01:13:53,504
Do you want to kiss her?

643
01:13:54,921 --> 01:13:56,400
Very much.

644
01:13:56,401 --> 01:13:58,232
Go on, then.

645
01:13:59,001 --> 01:14:01,200
I wouldn't feel right about it.

646
01:14:01,201 --> 01:14:03,040
I barely know her.
We've only met once.

647
01:14:03,041 --> 01:14:05,360
Haven't you ever heard
of love at first sight?

648
01:14:05,361 --> 01:14:07,360
Kiss her!

649
01:14:07,361 --> 01:14:08,862
Go on.

650
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:14,021
An enchantment, you say?

651
01:14:15,121 --> 01:14:17,271
Kiss her!

652
01:15:09,161 --> 01:15:10,920
You didn't do it properly!

653
01:15:10,921 --> 01:15:13,520
It's supposed to be
true love's kiss!

654
01:15:13,521 --> 01:15:15,120
I was certain he was the one.

655
01:15:15,121 --> 01:15:18,192
- What are you doing?
- We have to keep looking.

656
01:15:24,841 --> 01:15:26,627
I told you.

657
01:15:50,961 --> 01:15:53,862
I will not ask your forgiveness

658
01:15:54,441 --> 01:15:58,468
because what I have done
to you is unforgivable.

659
01:16:00,401 --> 01:16:02,551
I was so lost

660
01:16:03,121 --> 01:16:05,942
in hatred and revenge.

661
01:16:08,481 --> 01:16:10,983
Sweet Aurora,

662
01:16:12,481 --> 01:16:15,587
you stole what was left of my heart.

663
01:16:16,241 --> 01:16:18,948
And now I have lost you forever.

664
01:16:30,161 --> 01:16:36,031
I swear, no harm will come
to you as long as I live.

665
01:16:36,921 --> 01:16:42,302
And not a day shall pass
that I don't miss your smile.

666
01:17:10,721 --> 01:17:13,383
Hello, Godmother.

667
01:17:18,321 --> 01:17:20,710
Hello, beasty.

668
01:17:33,001 --> 01:17:35,071
No truer love.

669
01:17:48,241 --> 01:17:50,231
She's here, sire.

670
01:18:04,081 --> 01:18:06,424
Are we going back to the Moors now?

671
01:18:08,281 --> 01:18:10,510
If that is what you wish.

672
01:18:37,081 --> 01:18:38,628
We've got her!

673
01:18:43,361 --> 01:18:45,750
- Stop!
- Get back!

674
01:19:03,481 --> 01:19:05,267
No!

675
01:19:12,561 --> 01:19:14,506
Into a dragon.

676
01:19:40,281 --> 01:19:42,021
To the other side.

677
01:19:50,881 --> 01:19:52,985
Run, Aurora!

678
01:20:05,601 --> 01:20:08,880
Get back! Hold it steady!

679
01:20:08,881 --> 01:20:11,065
Pull to the left! Pull!

680
01:20:13,961 --> 01:20:15,872
Hold the line!

681
01:20:19,681 --> 01:20:22,627
Look out. Hold your line.

682
01:21:30,441 --> 01:21:33,706
- Close in.
- Bring it down!

683
01:22:00,681 --> 01:22:02,387
Enough!

684
01:22:08,041 --> 01:22:10,145
How does it feel?

685
01:22:11,081 --> 01:22:14,107
To be a fairy creature without wings

686
01:22:16,641 --> 01:22:19,792
in a world where you don't belong?

687
01:23:08,401 --> 01:23:10,027
Kill her!

688
01:23:10,161 --> 01:23:11,787
Kill her!

689
01:23:16,281 --> 01:23:18,271
Shoot!

690
01:23:46,041 --> 01:23:47,520
Shoot her!

691
01:23:47,521 --> 01:23:49,102
Take aim!

692
01:24:51,441 --> 01:24:53,102
It's over.

693
01:26:12,521 --> 01:26:15,520
<i>Maleficent brought down
her wall of thorns</i>

694
01:26:15,521 --> 01:26:18,308
<i>and took off her crown.</i>

695
01:26:19,081 --> 01:26:22,840
<i>And she invited Aurora to see
how the Moors had been once,</i>

696
01:26:22,841 --> 01:26:26,520
<i>long ago, when Maleficent
was but a child</i>

697
01:26:26,521 --> 01:26:29,262
<i>and her heart was bright.</i>

698
01:26:29,401 --> 01:26:32,632
<i>For now, it was again.</i>

699
01:26:35,361 --> 01:26:38,148
<i>But that was not all.</i>

700
01:26:48,841 --> 01:26:51,912
There she is. Hurry up.
They're waiting.

701
01:26:51,961 --> 01:26:53,747
Wait for me!

702
01:26:54,121 --> 01:26:56,783
We present this crown
to our little Aurora,

703
01:26:56,801 --> 01:27:00,305
for whom we have sacrificed
the best years of our...

704
01:27:00,401 --> 01:27:02,266
Never mind.

705
01:27:06,921 --> 01:27:10,504
Our kingdoms have been unified.

706
01:27:11,841 --> 01:27:14,264
You have your queen.

707
01:27:16,001 --> 01:27:20,586
<i>So you see, the story is
not quite as you were told,</i>

708
01:27:20,641 --> 01:27:22,320
<i>and I should know,</i>

709
01:27:22,321 --> 01:27:27,349
<i>for I was the one they
called Sleeping Beauty.</i>

710
01:28:00,201 --> 01:28:05,360
<i>In the end, my kingdom was
united not by a hero or a villain,</i>

711
01:28:05,361 --> 01:28:07,360
<i>as legend had predicted,</i>

712
01:28:07,361 --> 01:28:11,866
<i>but by one who was
both hero and villain.</i>

713
01:28:12,401 --> 01:28:16,462
<i>And her name was Maleficent.</i>
