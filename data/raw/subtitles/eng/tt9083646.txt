2
00:01:13,151 --> 00:01:14,294
Don't pick up, don't pick up.

3
00:01:18,606 --> 00:01:21,374
Why does it have to be so hard?

4
00:01:27,215 --> 00:01:29,415
Hello baby sister.

5
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,384
How old do we have to be

6
00:01:31,419 --> 00:01:34,120
before you're gonna
stop calling me that?

7
00:01:34,155 --> 00:01:37,023
We'll be wrinkled and
toothless and then, maybe.

8
00:01:37,058 --> 00:01:38,058
Okay.

9
00:01:38,126 --> 00:01:39,136
Can I take this?

10
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,160
Yeah thanks.

11
00:01:41,563 --> 00:01:44,764
I saw your face on the side
of a bus again the other day.

12
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,233
Even after four bestsellers
it never gets old.

13
00:01:48,169 --> 00:01:49,769
How was your drive?

14
00:01:49,804 --> 00:01:51,904
It's been a while
since you made it.

15
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,539
Beautiful as always.

16
00:01:53,575 --> 00:01:55,007
Lights from all the farm houses.

17
00:01:57,111 --> 00:01:59,478
I wish you'd tell me why
you stayed away for so long.

18
00:01:59,514 --> 00:02:00,791
We really missed
you at Christmastime

19
00:02:00,815 --> 00:02:02,226
at home all these years.

20
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,694
You know how it is.

21
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:05,785
Work gets in the way.

22
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,220
Anyway, I was
practically just here.

23
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:11,824
24 hours from moms
funeral doesn't count.

24
00:02:11,926 --> 00:02:14,026
It was just too
hard, that's all.

25
00:02:33,314 --> 00:02:35,514
I want you to enjoy
your time at Oliver's Well.

26
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,216
Hey, no working
over the holiday.

27
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:38,818
I promise.

28
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,198
But I do have to head home
the day after Christmas.

29
00:02:41,222 --> 00:02:42,021
No!

30
00:02:42,056 --> 00:02:43,467
I thought you had more time?

31
00:02:43,491 --> 00:02:45,891
Well that was
before the promotion.

32
00:02:45,927 --> 00:02:47,960
You are looking
at Emma Reynolds,

33
00:02:47,996 --> 00:02:50,574
Huntley and Morrison's
newest Junior Partner.

34
00:02:50,598 --> 00:02:52,064
Congratulations.

35
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:52,977
That's wonderful.

36
00:02:53,001 --> 00:02:54,834
Oh dad would be so...

37
00:02:56,738 --> 00:02:58,004
They would both be so proud.

38
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:04,455
Whatever the reasons, I'm glad
you came home this Christmas.

39
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:07,391
Andie, if I'd had any idea

40
00:03:07,415 --> 00:03:10,282
last year that both mom
and dad would be gone...

41
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:11,584
I know, I know.

42
00:03:11,619 --> 00:03:14,020
Hey, no regrets alright?

43
00:03:15,957 --> 00:03:18,535
They only spoil our present.

44
00:03:18,559 --> 00:03:20,826
Thereby multiplying
themselves 10 fold.

45
00:03:21,796 --> 00:03:23,696
That's pretty good,
you should write that.

46
00:03:23,731 --> 00:03:24,664
I did.

47
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:26,777
In my last book,
Mindful Passion.

48
00:03:26,801 --> 00:03:29,035
Mindfulness For
The Busy Creative.

49
00:03:30,638 --> 00:03:33,873
Mrs. Jacobs still
has her old popup store.

50
00:03:33,908 --> 00:03:34,573
Yup.

51
00:03:34,676 --> 00:03:36,208
Every year.

52
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,470
Keeping the old traditions
that she started with Bobby.

53
00:03:39,547 --> 00:03:40,813
Why don't you go take a look?

54
00:03:40,848 --> 00:03:42,126
I'll get us some
hot chocolate okay?

55
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,228
- That sounds delicious.
- Meet back here in 10?

56
00:03:44,252 --> 00:03:45,017
Okay.

57
00:03:45,053 --> 00:03:46,163
Alright.

58
00:03:55,229 --> 00:03:56,529
Emma Reynolds.

59
00:03:57,699 --> 00:03:58,442
Hello!

60
00:03:58,466 --> 00:03:59,598
Good morning.

61
00:04:02,036 --> 00:04:04,437
You might wanna
consider one of our

62
00:04:04,472 --> 00:04:05,771
blue ribbon wreaths.

63
00:04:05,873 --> 00:04:07,373
They're a town favorite.

64
00:04:07,408 --> 00:04:10,443
They were first made by one
of our most beloved residents.

65
00:04:10,478 --> 00:04:12,356
Caroline Reynolds.

66
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,124
I think it was the
first item we sold

67
00:04:14,148 --> 00:04:15,314
in this shop actually.

68
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,861
Yeah, blue's not
really a Christmas color.

69
00:04:17,885 --> 00:04:19,151
Not a Christmas color?

70
00:04:19,187 --> 00:04:20,119
No.

71
00:04:20,154 --> 00:04:22,354
Not like red, or green, or gold.

72
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,457
They are beautiful, unique.

73
00:04:24,492 --> 00:04:25,791
Yes, but not traditional.

74
00:04:25,893 --> 00:04:28,527
They've been a tradition
in my family for 40 years.

75
00:04:30,364 --> 00:04:31,764
Am I bothering you?

76
00:04:31,799 --> 00:04:32,710
Have we met?

77
00:04:32,734 --> 00:04:33,811
Did I steal your parking spot?

78
00:04:33,835 --> 00:04:35,201
I think you'd remember me.

79
00:04:35,303 --> 00:04:38,604
Mrs. Jacobs,
I will take this one.

80
00:04:38,706 --> 00:04:40,172
Wonderful dear.

81
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,586
It's so nice to see you.

82
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:43,776
You too.

83
00:04:43,878 --> 00:04:45,544
When your brother
told me you were finally

84
00:04:45,646 --> 00:04:47,279
coming home I about
danced in cheer.

85
00:04:48,549 --> 00:04:51,617
That house deserves a
big proper Christmas.

86
00:04:51,652 --> 00:04:53,285
Well, it'll be
our last one there,

87
00:04:53,321 --> 00:04:55,020
so we're gonna make it count.

88
00:04:55,056 --> 00:04:58,324
Well you make sure
to savor every moment.

89
00:04:58,426 --> 00:04:59,236
I will.

90
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,327
I miss her so much you know.

91
00:05:02,797 --> 00:05:03,596
How much do I owe you?

92
00:05:03,631 --> 00:05:04,575
Nothing.

93
00:05:04,599 --> 00:05:05,542
It's an early Christmas present.

94
00:05:05,566 --> 00:05:07,032
Thank you.

95
00:05:07,135 --> 00:05:07,945
Merry Christmas.

96
00:05:07,969 --> 00:05:10,369
Merry Christmas sweetheart.

97
00:05:11,739 --> 00:05:13,339
Bye.

98
00:05:29,123 --> 00:05:31,857
What are all these
cars doing here?

99
00:05:31,893 --> 00:05:33,203
Did you know we were
having people over?

100
00:05:33,227 --> 00:05:34,227
No.

101
00:05:51,112 --> 00:05:51,877
Andie.

102
00:05:51,912 --> 00:05:53,378
Daniel.

103
00:05:53,414 --> 00:05:54,680
Emma.

104
00:05:54,715 --> 00:05:55,992
Why are you sneaking
through the kitchen?

105
00:05:56,016 --> 00:05:57,060
You didn't tell me
there was gonna

106
00:05:57,084 --> 00:05:58,528
be a party here tonight.

107
00:05:58,552 --> 00:05:59,685
I must have.

108
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,619
I'm sure I did.

109
00:06:00,654 --> 00:06:01,787
I'm sure you didn't.

110
00:06:02,756 --> 00:06:03,522
Rumi!

111
00:06:03,557 --> 00:06:04,668
Hi mom!

112
00:06:04,692 --> 00:06:05,972
Oh I missed you so much.

113
00:06:06,193 --> 00:06:07,270
Rumi!

114
00:06:07,294 --> 00:06:08,527
Hi.

115
00:06:08,562 --> 00:06:09,806
Oh you look so beautiful.

116
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,141
Oh thank you.

117
00:06:11,165 --> 00:06:12,909
Your uncle was just
trying to convince us

118
00:06:12,933 --> 00:06:15,512
he told us about this
little shindig here.

119
00:06:15,536 --> 00:06:17,002
Well I mean, grandma and grandpa

120
00:06:17,104 --> 00:06:18,804
did have it every
year at the same time.

121
00:06:18,873 --> 00:06:20,183
So it's not exactly new.

122
00:06:20,207 --> 00:06:22,141
It doesn't matter.

123
00:06:22,176 --> 00:06:24,443
The point is we are
all here together.

124
00:06:27,281 --> 00:06:28,425
Hey where's Ian?

125
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:30,861
Oh he's coming for
Christmas Eve isn't he?

126
00:06:30,885 --> 00:06:33,118
You're looking a little relaxed.

127
00:06:33,154 --> 00:06:34,453
Relaxed?

128
00:06:34,555 --> 00:06:36,199
Come on, throw on a
Christmas sweater or something.

129
00:06:36,223 --> 00:06:37,968
All dad's clients are here.

130
00:06:37,992 --> 00:06:40,893
Last Reynolds Christmas
party in Honeysuckle house.

131
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:43,462
He wanted us to
make it a good one.

132
00:07:02,216 --> 00:07:03,193
There we go Emmy!

133
00:07:03,217 --> 00:07:04,816
It's been waiting
for you all year!

134
00:07:04,852 --> 00:07:06,919
I wish I could make
Christmas forever.

135
00:07:08,522 --> 00:07:10,155
Us too sweetie.

136
00:07:10,191 --> 00:07:13,559
Well at least we know it
will come no matter what.

137
00:07:50,731 --> 00:07:51,675
Auntie Emma!

138
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:52,531
Hi Sophie!

139
00:07:52,633 --> 00:07:54,466
Welcome back Emma.

140
00:07:54,568 --> 00:07:55,701
Thank you Emory!

141
00:07:55,736 --> 00:07:57,013
Marco, is that even you?

142
00:07:57,037 --> 00:07:59,905
You are so tall I
barely recognized you.

143
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:00,717
Sophie, what did we do?

144
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:02,174
Color coordinate here?

145
00:08:05,913 --> 00:08:07,346
Here we go.

146
00:08:07,381 --> 00:08:08,381
Come on.

147
00:08:09,316 --> 00:08:11,394
Everyone,
can I have your attention.

148
00:08:11,418 --> 00:08:13,485
Boring speech,
we'll need fortification.

149
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,020
On behalf of my and my sisters,

150
00:08:15,122 --> 00:08:17,067
I want to thank you all
for coming.

151
00:08:17,091 --> 00:08:18,657
We really are touched
that you joined us

152
00:08:18,692 --> 00:08:21,927
in celebrating what was mom
and dads favorite time of year.

153
00:08:23,697 --> 00:08:25,597
Mom and dad married
on Christmas day.

154
00:08:25,633 --> 00:08:27,899
They passed out candy
canes as party favors

155
00:08:27,935 --> 00:08:30,135
and served a full
Christmas dinner.

156
00:08:31,171 --> 00:08:32,171
It was a town event.

157
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,140
It was love at first sight.

158
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:40,178
But they turned a
world wind romance

159
00:08:41,148 --> 00:08:45,183
into a 53 year marriage.

160
00:08:45,219 --> 00:08:46,952
Our parents instilled us,

161
00:08:46,987 --> 00:08:47,987
my sisters and me,

162
00:08:49,256 --> 00:08:53,258
a love of family,
of celebration.

163
00:08:53,294 --> 00:08:57,629
Andie, Emma, they
were so proud of you.

164
00:08:58,966 --> 00:09:02,646
And so, I ask you
all to raise a glass

165
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,670
for a toast.

166
00:09:05,406 --> 00:09:06,872
Yes.

167
00:09:08,309 --> 00:09:10,086
To mom and dad.

168
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,350
To mom and dad.

169
00:09:11,378 --> 00:09:12,844
To Cliff and Carol.

170
00:09:38,572 --> 00:09:40,605
Goodness, I hope Emma

171
00:09:40,641 --> 00:09:43,386
doesn't find her secret
present this year.

172
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:44,676
But she's so smart,

173
00:09:44,712 --> 00:09:46,345
she'll probably
look under my desk.

174
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:50,482
Emma!

175
00:09:50,517 --> 00:09:52,317
You are ever so clever.

176
00:10:00,694 --> 00:10:02,761
Would you like
some chocolate mommy?

177
00:10:14,308 --> 00:10:16,241
Apologies for the intrusion.

178
00:10:16,343 --> 00:10:17,153
That's all right.

179
00:10:17,177 --> 00:10:18,643
How are you Mrs. Bernadette?

180
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:20,857
I'm sorry to hear
you're selling the house.

181
00:10:20,881 --> 00:10:23,115
Oh, well, we are too

182
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,050
but it's not really
fair to ask Daniel

183
00:10:25,085 --> 00:10:26,918
to keep looking after
it all by himself.

184
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,487
Andie's got her house and I'm...

185
00:10:28,522 --> 00:10:30,122
A New Yorker.

186
00:10:30,157 --> 00:10:33,024
Daniel's catering my
Christmas Ball Fundraiser

187
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,926
for the Historical Society.

188
00:10:34,962 --> 00:10:35,627
Did he tell you?

189
00:10:35,729 --> 00:10:36,706
Yes he did.

190
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:37,996
It's a great choice.

191
00:10:38,031 --> 00:10:40,165
He inherited my moms
talent for cooking

192
00:10:40,267 --> 00:10:42,067
and dads business sense.

193
00:10:42,102 --> 00:10:43,422
He won't tell me
what you're doing

194
00:10:43,504 --> 00:10:45,971
with Carol's Victorian desk.

195
00:10:46,073 --> 00:10:48,206
Well that's because
we haven't decided yet.

196
00:10:48,242 --> 00:10:50,675
It should go to the
Historical Society.

197
00:10:50,778 --> 00:10:53,512
We can offer you
a healthy tax receipt.

198
00:10:53,547 --> 00:10:54,713
Thank you for that.

199
00:10:54,815 --> 00:10:56,259
I will discuss it
with Andie and Dan.

200
00:10:56,283 --> 00:10:59,351
Excuse me, my goddaughter
owes me a bear of a hug!

201
00:10:59,386 --> 00:11:00,386
Joe!

202
00:11:00,454 --> 00:11:01,787
Hello sweet pea.

203
00:11:02,923 --> 00:11:03,867
Can I have a word with you?

204
00:11:03,891 --> 00:11:04,667
Yes!

205
00:11:04,691 --> 00:11:05,457
Okay.

206
00:11:05,492 --> 00:11:06,492
Excuse us.

207
00:11:07,928 --> 00:11:09,728
Cliff left the firm
in good shape.

208
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:10,996
Yeah?

209
00:11:11,031 --> 00:11:12,308
We didn't lose a single client.

210
00:11:12,332 --> 00:11:13,243
That must keep you on your toes.

211
00:11:13,267 --> 00:11:15,011
Keep me at my desk more like.

212
00:11:15,035 --> 00:11:16,312
Thinking of hiring someone soon.

213
00:11:16,336 --> 00:11:17,969
Now we do everything
now you know.

214
00:11:18,005 --> 00:11:20,338
From parking tickets
to land titles.

215
00:11:20,374 --> 00:11:23,408
Dad knew every
single name didn't he?

216
00:11:23,444 --> 00:11:24,721
Gosh, I can't
remember the last time

217
00:11:24,745 --> 00:11:26,812
my clients were actual people.

218
00:11:27,948 --> 00:11:30,393
So tell me about life
as a Junior Partner.

219
00:11:30,417 --> 00:11:31,516
News travels fast.

220
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:33,919
Andie mentioned it.

221
00:11:33,954 --> 00:11:36,388
I guess that means you're
happy at Huntley and Morrison?

222
00:11:36,423 --> 00:11:39,602
I never expected to
make partner so quickly.

223
00:11:39,626 --> 00:11:41,359
It's an incredible opportunity.

224
00:11:42,563 --> 00:11:44,329
I'm throwing my
usual New Year's party.

225
00:11:44,431 --> 00:11:45,431
You'll be there right?

226
00:11:45,532 --> 00:11:47,566
I leave the day after Christmas.

227
00:11:47,668 --> 00:11:48,967
That'll be it huh?

228
00:11:49,002 --> 00:11:50,635
I'll come back
and visit Oliver's Well

229
00:11:50,737 --> 00:11:52,237
from time to time.

230
00:11:52,272 --> 00:11:53,338
If you say so.

231
00:11:54,808 --> 00:11:57,209
Now I think some gingerbread
with my name on it.

232
00:12:02,282 --> 00:12:04,015
Look what I just found.

233
00:12:05,152 --> 00:12:06,152
Moms old cookie tins.

234
00:12:07,654 --> 00:12:09,866
Man she stashed stuff
everywhere.

235
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:13,091
She always knew exactly
where to find stuff.

236
00:12:13,126 --> 00:12:15,694
How lucky are we to have
had mom and dad as examples?

237
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,374
You know Daniel,
you're gonna need to talk

238
00:12:18,398 --> 00:12:20,665
to Ian about what's
taking him so long

239
00:12:20,701 --> 00:12:23,579
to put a ring on our
awesome sisters finger.

240
00:12:23,603 --> 00:12:25,070
He's way too busy right now

241
00:12:25,105 --> 00:12:27,105
getting ready for Mary
Bernadette's Christmas Ball.

242
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,240
Which by the way,
congratulations on that gig.

243
00:12:29,276 --> 00:12:30,208
Thanks.

244
00:12:30,243 --> 00:12:31,176
It's big.

245
00:12:31,211 --> 00:12:32,977
Could really open doors for us.

246
00:12:34,281 --> 00:12:36,047
Rumi's been a
lifesaver by the way.

247
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,849
Serving and helping Anne Marie.

248
00:12:39,286 --> 00:12:41,753
She decide whether
she's switching majors?

249
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,987
Switching majors?

250
00:12:43,023 --> 00:12:45,156
She was thinking about
dropping the fine arts

251
00:12:45,258 --> 00:12:46,424
and doing something else.

252
00:12:47,394 --> 00:12:48,660
But Rumi loves her program.

253
00:12:48,695 --> 00:12:50,440
When'd she last tell you that?

254
00:12:50,464 --> 00:12:51,464
Oh boy.

255
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,799
I don't pry Daniel.

256
00:12:54,835 --> 00:12:56,768
Sure, you know her best.

257
00:12:56,803 --> 00:12:58,203
Hey, you guys.

258
00:12:58,238 --> 00:12:59,137
At her birthday dinner though,

259
00:12:59,172 --> 00:13:00,638
she said she needed to change.

260
00:13:00,674 --> 00:13:01,884
Well I would of
liked to be there.

261
00:13:01,908 --> 00:13:02,574
You know I was just...

262
00:13:02,609 --> 00:13:03,842
I broke up with Ian.

263
00:13:05,345 --> 00:13:06,911
What?

264
00:13:06,947 --> 00:13:09,025
Was that one of your jokes
to break the tension or?

265
00:13:09,049 --> 00:13:09,992
No.

266
00:13:10,016 --> 00:13:11,282
I mean yes.

267
00:13:12,452 --> 00:13:13,696
No.

268
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,020
So he's not coming
for Christmas.

269
00:13:17,758 --> 00:13:19,991
You've been together forever.

270
00:13:20,026 --> 00:13:21,292
Mom and dad loved Ian.

271
00:13:21,328 --> 00:13:23,628
So did I, but it
just wasn't working.

272
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,230
So sorry sweetie.

273
00:13:26,633 --> 00:13:31,469
There's no better time to
start over than Christmas.

274
00:13:32,439 --> 00:13:33,439
True.

275
00:13:34,374 --> 00:13:36,018
We all know mom and
dad would not want us

276
00:13:36,042 --> 00:13:38,276
to be sad during Christmas.

277
00:13:38,311 --> 00:13:39,311
Agreed.

278
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,814
So, I'm determined we stay true

279
00:13:42,849 --> 00:13:45,850
to our Reynold's
family traditions.

280
00:13:45,886 --> 00:13:47,986
The Snowman Festival is a first,

281
00:13:48,021 --> 00:13:50,233
and the town tree lighting,

282
00:13:50,257 --> 00:13:53,324
then we will be decorating
our tree on the weekend.

283
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,539
And Mary Bernadette's Christmas
Ball is on Christmas Eve.

284
00:13:56,563 --> 00:13:57,874
And somewhere in there
we eat and sleep right?

285
00:13:57,898 --> 00:14:00,465
We will all participate.

286
00:14:00,567 --> 00:14:01,733
I need you two to handle

287
00:14:01,768 --> 00:14:04,936
getting the house and
the contents appraised.

288
00:14:04,971 --> 00:14:07,438
Anne Marie and I have
prep to do for the ball.

289
00:14:07,507 --> 00:14:08,540
It has to go perfectly.

290
00:14:08,642 --> 00:14:09,974
Daniel we got this.

291
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,010
Just leave it to us.

292
00:14:12,245 --> 00:14:13,711
We have to make
this last Christmas

293
00:14:13,814 --> 00:14:15,013
on Honeysuckle Lane

294
00:14:16,116 --> 00:14:17,116
perfect.

295
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:23,499
How was I supposed
to know the old

296
00:14:23,523 --> 00:14:25,490
Antique Emporium had shut down?

297
00:14:25,525 --> 00:14:26,958
What?

298
00:14:26,993 --> 00:14:29,260
You don't go antiquing every
other weekend like mom did?

299
00:14:29,329 --> 00:14:30,495
I missed that gene.

300
00:14:31,832 --> 00:14:34,265
Anyway, if there's anyone
who will know an alternative,

301
00:14:34,367 --> 00:14:35,367
it's Maureen.

302
00:14:36,303 --> 00:14:38,247
She bought this
place two years ago.

303
00:14:38,271 --> 00:14:40,371
It's amazing how much
everything changes

304
00:14:40,407 --> 00:14:42,640
and yet everything
stays exactly the same.

305
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,076
Hey, merry almost Christmas.

306
00:14:45,178 --> 00:14:46,644
Hi.

307
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,591
Hey Emma, you probably don't
remember me, Maureen Cutter.

308
00:14:48,615 --> 00:14:50,193
My family left halfway
through high school.

309
00:14:50,217 --> 00:14:52,295
Oh yes, of course I
remember you Maureen.

310
00:14:52,319 --> 00:14:54,786
Your dad came in every
Saturday to read his paper

311
00:14:54,888 --> 00:14:57,466
and he always left a tip
with a note on the receipt.

312
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:59,123
The sweetest.

313
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:01,726
This is where he brought
mom on their first date

314
00:15:01,828 --> 00:15:02,828
when it wasn't Crumpets.

315
00:15:02,863 --> 00:15:04,562
No way!
I had no idea.

316
00:15:04,598 --> 00:15:06,397
Do you happen to know someone

317
00:15:06,433 --> 00:15:09,745
who could help us appraise
our parents estate?

318
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:11,836
I can think of someone alright.

319
00:15:11,872 --> 00:15:14,439
The best man for the job
is Morgan Shelby.

320
00:15:14,474 --> 00:15:16,274
He's a former history professor.

321
00:15:16,376 --> 00:15:17,520
Harvard.

322
00:15:17,544 --> 00:15:19,043
Now he owns
Memory Lane Antiques.

323
00:15:20,146 --> 00:15:23,025
- Sounds good.
- Thanks.

324
00:15:23,049 --> 00:15:24,682
Well, do you want me
to go scope that out

325
00:15:24,784 --> 00:15:25,928
and see if it's something?

326
00:15:25,952 --> 00:15:27,085
Okay.

327
00:15:55,982 --> 00:15:57,115
Hello again.

328
00:15:58,418 --> 00:16:00,051
It's you.

329
00:16:00,086 --> 00:16:02,465
I don't think we've been
properly introduced.

330
00:16:02,489 --> 00:16:03,489
Morgan Shelby.

331
00:16:06,493 --> 00:16:09,572
I think I must be
in the wrong place.

332
00:16:09,596 --> 00:16:11,529
Oh no, we're the only
antique shop in town.

333
00:16:12,499 --> 00:16:15,566
You're Cliff and
Carol's daughter.

334
00:16:15,602 --> 00:16:16,846
Emma the New Yorker.

335
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,937
My secret identity
has been unmasked.

336
00:16:18,972 --> 00:16:21,205
- Mrs. Jacobs.
- I can't reveal my sources.

337
00:16:21,241 --> 00:16:25,743
Well, I'm looking to have
my parents estate appraised.

338
00:16:25,779 --> 00:16:27,011
Art and antiques.

339
00:16:27,047 --> 00:16:28,813
I can do a walkthrough for you.

340
00:16:28,848 --> 00:16:31,560
Let you know if
anything's worth more than

341
00:16:31,584 --> 00:16:32,828
sentimental value.

342
00:16:32,852 --> 00:16:35,920
Not that sentimental items
aren't worth anything.

343
00:16:35,956 --> 00:16:36,956
Just,

344
00:16:38,058 --> 00:16:40,425
I find most peoples
expectations are too high.

345
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,538
Are we talking
about antiques still

346
00:16:42,562 --> 00:16:44,062
or just life in general?

347
00:16:45,832 --> 00:16:47,899
Thank you for your
time Mr. Shelby.

348
00:16:47,934 --> 00:16:50,034
I'll go over it with
my brother and sister.

349
00:16:53,573 --> 00:16:57,108
Going through a
loved ones estate

350
00:16:57,143 --> 00:16:59,010
can be difficult

351
00:16:59,746 --> 00:17:00,746
at any time.

352
00:17:01,348 --> 00:17:02,348
At Christmas,

353
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:07,263
must be very very hard.

354
00:17:07,287 --> 00:17:10,221
And I'm sorry.

355
00:17:10,256 --> 00:17:11,656
When are you free?

356
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,362
The taste is very good.
Maybe even exceptional.

357
00:17:17,464 --> 00:17:19,408
Except in wreaths obviously.

358
00:17:19,432 --> 00:17:20,643
Oh I'll forgive
her that as long as I

359
00:17:20,667 --> 00:17:22,478
don't see any Rudolph
the Red Nose Reindeers

360
00:17:22,502 --> 00:17:24,235
or angels in hot pink.

361
00:17:25,105 --> 00:17:28,139
Well I only wear hot
pink Christmas day.

362
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:34,812
This guy used to have a partner.

363
00:17:34,914 --> 00:17:36,514
What happened?

364
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:39,584
I broke it last time
I was home for Christmas

365
00:17:39,619 --> 00:17:41,252
and I haven't found
a replacement.

366
00:17:44,357 --> 00:17:45,590
A lot of Christmases here.

367
00:17:46,893 --> 00:17:47,893
A lot of memories.

368
00:17:49,796 --> 00:17:51,629
Well thankfully
those don't go away.

369
00:17:53,366 --> 00:17:55,444
You know, I usually
advise people to

370
00:17:55,468 --> 00:17:56,801
choose something special.

371
00:17:58,004 --> 00:18:01,072
And make it represent
everything they have to let go of.

372
00:18:01,107 --> 00:18:03,374
Thank you, that's really
good advice professor.

373
00:18:04,677 --> 00:18:07,078
Please don't call me professor.
Dr. Shelby's fine.

374
00:18:09,049 --> 00:18:10,314
When I was a little kid,

375
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,961
my mom used to hide
all these little gifts

376
00:18:11,985 --> 00:18:13,885
around the house in December.

377
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,560
Like a scavenger advent hunt.

378
00:18:15,622 --> 00:18:17,433
Exactly.

379
00:18:17,457 --> 00:18:20,191
Her favorite place to
hide things is in her desk.

380
00:18:21,461 --> 00:18:24,228
Or under it.

381
00:18:25,365 --> 00:18:26,365
This is special.

382
00:18:29,135 --> 00:18:31,469
But only of sentimental
value I'm sure.

383
00:18:31,504 --> 00:18:32,504
No.

384
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,840
I admit it, I stand corrected.

385
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,175
This...

386
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:40,211
Did your mother ever show
you the hidden compartments?

387
00:18:40,246 --> 00:18:42,480
What hidden compartments?

388
00:18:48,655 --> 00:18:49,655
I had no idea!

389
00:18:52,892 --> 00:18:55,226
They're letters
written to my mom.

390
00:19:05,105 --> 00:19:09,373
"Dearest Caroline, I miss you
more than you can imagine.

391
00:19:09,476 --> 00:19:13,211
"But my heart is buoyed with
thoughts of our engagement."

392
00:19:14,347 --> 00:19:16,447
Your father was
quite the wordsmith.

393
00:19:17,717 --> 00:19:19,650
This is from before
my parents met.

394
00:19:20,653 --> 00:19:21,653
Signed RJ.

395
00:19:23,923 --> 00:19:26,268
These aren't from my father.

396
00:19:26,292 --> 00:19:28,359
My mother was engaged
to someone else.

397
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:36,468
Well the earliest
is from January 1964.

398
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,181
And the last one?

399
00:19:38,205 --> 00:19:39,816
June 1965.

400
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,242
- When was it your parents met?
- June 1965.

401
00:19:44,878 --> 00:19:46,111
Well that's not strange.

402
00:19:46,146 --> 00:19:47,986
I mean most people have
multiple relationships.

403
00:19:48,048 --> 00:19:50,649
I know, but we always
thought my father

404
00:19:50,684 --> 00:19:52,784
was my mothers first love.

405
00:19:52,886 --> 00:19:55,854
Their story's kind of
famous in Oliver's Well.

406
00:19:55,956 --> 00:19:58,457
They married in this very
house on Christmas day,

407
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,670
six months after they met.

408
00:20:00,694 --> 00:20:03,595
My mother was on a bus
on her way to Richmond.

409
00:20:03,631 --> 00:20:06,198
My father sat in the
seat across from her.

410
00:20:07,034 --> 00:20:10,035
She looked up, caught his eye,

411
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:12,671
and they noticed each other
staring at each other.

412
00:20:14,908 --> 00:20:15,908
Then he knew.

413
00:20:17,011 --> 00:20:18,011
Yeah.

414
00:20:20,714 --> 00:20:22,547
Apparently my mother
knew even though

415
00:20:22,616 --> 00:20:24,716
she was engaged to
someone else at the time.

416
00:20:24,752 --> 00:20:27,686
And I'm assuming you have
no idea who this RJ is?

417
00:20:27,721 --> 00:20:28,721
Not a clue.

418
00:20:30,424 --> 00:20:31,189
Okay.

419
00:20:31,225 --> 00:20:33,458
Hello hello!
Anybody home?

420
00:20:33,494 --> 00:20:35,939
That's my brother. He cannot
know anything about this.

421
00:20:35,963 --> 00:20:38,008
- Why?
- Because it would crush him.

422
00:20:38,032 --> 00:20:40,110
He puts my parents
marriage on a pedestal.

423
00:20:40,134 --> 00:20:42,100
So you're gonna keep
it a secret from him

424
00:20:42,202 --> 00:20:43,380
even though you're
angry at your mother

425
00:20:43,404 --> 00:20:44,604
for keeping a secret from you?

426
00:20:44,638 --> 00:20:46,071
Please don't judge me.

427
00:20:46,106 --> 00:20:49,608
If my brother found out it would
ruin his perfect Christmas.

428
00:20:49,643 --> 00:20:50,909
I will tell him about RJ,

429
00:20:50,944 --> 00:20:52,744
I just wanna find
out who he is first.

430
00:20:54,348 --> 00:20:55,625
If that's what you want
he won't hear it from me.

431
00:20:55,649 --> 00:20:56,649
Thank you.

432
00:20:57,918 --> 00:20:59,496
- Hello.
- Hi.

433
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,452
Hey.

434
00:21:00,487 --> 00:21:02,399
Morgan Shelby, antiques.

435
00:21:02,423 --> 00:21:05,057
If I may, absolute beautiful
home you have here.

436
00:21:07,094 --> 00:21:10,228
Emma, you feel free to call me
if you decide you need my help.

437
00:21:10,331 --> 00:21:12,275
I will show myself out.

438
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:15,067
Oh don't be silly,
I'll walk you out.

439
00:21:27,981 --> 00:21:28,981
RJ Dublin.

440
00:21:31,018 --> 00:21:33,418
You were a writer born in
Oliver's Well, Virginia.

441
00:21:33,454 --> 00:21:34,454
That narrows it down.

442
00:21:43,497 --> 00:21:45,564
Hello?
Hello?

443
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:46,599
Anybody in?

444
00:21:47,234 --> 00:21:48,234
Hey Joe!

445
00:21:54,475 --> 00:21:55,941
Hi Joe.

446
00:21:59,613 --> 00:22:02,080
Daniel mentioned you were all
going to the Snowman Festival.

447
00:22:02,116 --> 00:22:03,482
I thought I'd come
give you a lift.

448
00:22:03,517 --> 00:22:05,417
He thought I was
gonna forget, didn't he?

449
00:22:05,452 --> 00:22:07,397
I can neither confirm nor deny.

450
00:22:08,689 --> 00:22:11,656
I actually have a
question to ask you.

451
00:22:11,725 --> 00:22:14,993
- Well that makes two of us.
- Really?

452
00:22:16,296 --> 00:22:17,296
Now I'm intrigued.

453
00:22:18,732 --> 00:22:20,031
Emma,

454
00:22:20,134 --> 00:22:21,134
the truth is,

455
00:22:22,069 --> 00:22:24,669
I've decided it's time to let
someone else take over the firm.

456
00:22:26,306 --> 00:22:29,674
Well, I can't say that's
entirely unexpected.

457
00:22:31,311 --> 00:22:33,423
I know dad wouldn't of
wanted you to wreck your

458
00:22:33,447 --> 00:22:34,858
health keeping it afloat.

459
00:22:34,882 --> 00:22:39,050
And, I think he would have
wanted me to pass the torch.

460
00:22:40,554 --> 00:22:41,554
To you.

461
00:22:42,289 --> 00:22:44,734
- Joe...
- You know the town, the people.

462
00:22:44,758 --> 00:22:47,125
It's important Emma,
they can trust you.

463
00:22:47,161 --> 00:22:50,729
Your parents were so much a part
of the fabric of Oliver's Well.

464
00:22:50,764 --> 00:22:52,030
I have a job.

465
00:22:52,065 --> 00:22:54,766
I was just given the
opportunity of a lifetime.

466
00:22:55,936 --> 00:22:57,046
Well you say it's
an opportunity,

467
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,782
but is it the one
that makes you happy?

468
00:22:58,806 --> 00:23:02,207
I'm not unhappy.
I'm nervous.

469
00:23:02,242 --> 00:23:04,276
It's a whole lot of change.

470
00:23:04,311 --> 00:23:06,678
But I left Oliver's Well
for a reason.

471
00:23:06,713 --> 00:23:09,147
I made my decision
a long time ago.

472
00:23:09,183 --> 00:23:10,782
I can't just uproot my life.

473
00:23:12,019 --> 00:23:13,518
Life goes with you Emma.

474
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,071
You're so much like your mother.

475
00:23:22,095 --> 00:23:23,673
So sure of yourself.

476
00:23:23,697 --> 00:23:25,497
Really? I thought I
was more like my dad.

477
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:27,265
No, you're her.

478
00:23:27,301 --> 00:23:29,034
More than you know.

479
00:23:29,069 --> 00:23:30,769
Now what were you going to ask?

480
00:23:33,841 --> 00:23:36,908
I was just gonna ask,

481
00:23:36,944 --> 00:23:39,544
do you have any recommendations
for a good real estate agent?

482
00:23:59,933 --> 00:24:01,233
Darling have you seen these?

483
00:24:02,803 --> 00:24:04,569
The ones you make
are just as pretty.

484
00:24:05,939 --> 00:24:07,839
You could probably
earn just as much

485
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:09,441
starting a jewelry
business as you do

486
00:24:09,476 --> 00:24:10,720
working for Uncle Daniel.

487
00:24:10,744 --> 00:24:12,655
Why are you so worried
about me making money?

488
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:15,247
I'm barely 20-years-old,
can't I just enjoy college?

489
00:24:15,282 --> 00:24:17,048
You're enjoying
your classes then?

490
00:24:18,018 --> 00:24:19,317
Yeah, they're all good.

491
00:24:19,353 --> 00:24:21,119
You can talk to me you know.

492
00:24:21,221 --> 00:24:24,356
About anything, anything at all.

493
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:25,902
It's been a slow few weeks mom.

494
00:24:25,926 --> 00:24:27,659
Not really much to
write home about.

495
00:24:29,663 --> 00:24:30,829
I should go.

496
00:24:30,898 --> 00:24:32,831
I have to meet the choir
for rehearsal.

497
00:24:39,473 --> 00:24:40,783
We have two teams.

498
00:24:40,807 --> 00:24:42,774
Myself and the kids and...

499
00:24:42,876 --> 00:24:44,009
Emma and Ian.

500
00:24:44,044 --> 00:24:45,210
No, no, no...

501
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:47,423
Oh lovely, I haven't
met your gentleman Emma.

502
00:24:47,447 --> 00:24:49,414
No, I'm actually
not participating.

503
00:24:49,483 --> 00:24:51,182
But you're on the list.

504
00:24:51,285 --> 00:24:52,784
Daniel, you signed us up?

505
00:24:52,886 --> 00:24:54,553
Yeah, it was too late to cancel.

506
00:24:56,924 --> 00:25:00,169
Hold on one minute if you will.

507
00:25:00,193 --> 00:25:01,193
I'll be right back.

508
00:25:04,898 --> 00:25:06,031
Excuse me sir.

509
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,166
What's this?

510
00:25:08,235 --> 00:25:11,636
Well Emma's snowman making partner
is absent so you'll have to do.

511
00:25:11,672 --> 00:25:12,804
No.

512
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:14,551
I'm more of an observer,
not so much a doer.

513
00:25:14,575 --> 00:25:17,776
I tend to avoid things that
involve snow and people.

514
00:25:17,811 --> 00:25:19,711
Well, too bad Mr. Shelby.

515
00:25:19,746 --> 00:25:23,182
Today is the day that
you are going to live a little.

516
00:25:24,151 --> 00:25:25,750
Here's your partner Emma.

517
00:25:26,887 --> 00:25:28,520
Oh no, no, no, no.

518
00:25:28,622 --> 00:25:29,988
If I'm gonna have a partner,

519
00:25:30,057 --> 00:25:32,991
it can't be somebody with zero
snowman making ability.

520
00:25:33,026 --> 00:25:34,926
I didn't say I have zero
snowman making ability.

521
00:25:34,962 --> 00:25:37,040
You didn't have to.
I could tell that about you.

522
00:25:37,064 --> 00:25:38,174
It's something of a
gift I have actually.

523
00:25:38,198 --> 00:25:39,309
Ms. Reynolds,
we're going to make

524
00:25:39,333 --> 00:25:40,899
the greatest
snowman of all time.

525
00:25:40,934 --> 00:25:43,335
I certainly hope so
'cause I'm in it to win it.

526
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:44,480
Absolutely.

527
00:25:44,504 --> 00:25:45,604
We don't do things by half.

528
00:25:45,639 --> 00:25:47,105
However, small thing.

529
00:25:48,075 --> 00:25:49,341
No gloves.

530
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:51,510
Game face on.
My brother got me into this

531
00:25:51,612 --> 00:25:53,724
and now I'm gonna make him pay.

532
00:25:53,748 --> 00:25:55,325
You're really scary.

533
00:25:55,349 --> 00:25:57,594
I mean cute, but scary.

534
00:25:57,618 --> 00:25:59,885
Alright, snowman makers, ready!

535
00:26:01,489 --> 00:26:05,202
Go!

536
00:26:20,374 --> 00:26:21,907
There's only one stick.

537
00:26:22,009 --> 00:26:23,009
It's okay.

538
00:26:31,419 --> 00:26:34,186
Well this is a
very nice snowman.

539
00:26:40,294 --> 00:26:41,627
One more minute!

540
00:26:43,531 --> 00:26:44,830
So hang on.

541
00:26:44,899 --> 00:26:47,377
You've actually never done
any of these town events?

542
00:26:47,401 --> 00:26:48,512
Nope.

543
00:26:48,536 --> 00:26:50,803
Snowman Festival, tree lighting?

544
00:26:50,838 --> 00:26:51,581
No way.

545
00:26:51,605 --> 00:26:52,871
Christmas Ball?

546
00:26:52,907 --> 00:26:53,706
Tell me you've been
to the Christmas Ball.

547
00:26:53,741 --> 00:26:54,673
You're coming right?

548
00:26:54,709 --> 00:26:55,841
No.

549
00:26:55,943 --> 00:26:57,710
I prefer to observe
at a distance.

550
00:26:57,745 --> 00:26:59,678
You mean hide in the background.

551
00:27:01,148 --> 00:27:02,581
Okay everybody!

552
00:27:02,616 --> 00:27:03,415
Times up!

553
00:27:03,451 --> 00:27:05,517
Stop making your snowman!

554
00:27:08,622 --> 00:27:10,556
I think we might
actually win this thing.

555
00:27:10,658 --> 00:27:12,102
I thought you said you had no

556
00:27:12,126 --> 00:27:13,258
snowman making abilities?

557
00:27:13,294 --> 00:27:15,060
I think we've unleashed
a hidden talent.

558
00:27:15,096 --> 00:27:16,807
Why do you sound sad?

559
00:27:16,831 --> 00:27:18,397
A cowboy here.

560
00:27:18,432 --> 00:27:20,699
Look how hard Sophie and
Marco worked on theirs.

561
00:27:20,735 --> 00:27:22,001
Sophie and Marco?

562
00:27:22,036 --> 00:27:23,736
I worked for 20 minutes
on Ernest's chin.

563
00:27:23,771 --> 00:27:25,104
It's a masterpiece!

564
00:27:30,578 --> 00:27:32,511
And how about you?
Look at this.

565
00:27:32,546 --> 00:27:35,247
A little baby snowman
with a top hat.

566
00:27:37,985 --> 00:27:38,985
Whoops.

567
00:27:40,087 --> 00:27:41,087
Dear.

568
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:44,957
He seems to have met with
something of an accident.

569
00:27:46,894 --> 00:27:48,961
No head means disqualification.

570
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:50,963
It was very clumsy of me.

571
00:27:51,065 --> 00:27:52,197
Probably the gloves.

572
00:27:53,634 --> 00:27:54,767
Well I'm so sorry.

573
00:27:57,872 --> 00:27:59,649
Thank you.

574
00:27:59,673 --> 00:28:02,408
Now can I take these off and
buy you some hot chocolate?

575
00:28:02,443 --> 00:28:03,186
Yeah.

576
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:04,210
Okay.

577
00:28:09,517 --> 00:28:12,095
Every year the kids make
these wooden ornaments

578
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:14,197
and write a wish on the back

579
00:28:14,221 --> 00:28:15,821
before they hang
them on the tree.

580
00:28:15,856 --> 00:28:17,289
What'd you wish for as a kid?

581
00:28:19,393 --> 00:28:20,325
I don't remember.

582
00:28:20,361 --> 00:28:21,938
Probably puppies.

583
00:28:21,962 --> 00:28:23,462
Plural.

584
00:28:23,564 --> 00:28:25,230
It all seemed so easy then.

585
00:28:26,534 --> 00:28:28,078
Now I don't even know
what I'd write.

586
00:28:28,102 --> 00:28:29,868
So no Christmas wish
for this year?

587
00:28:32,506 --> 00:28:33,506
Clarity.

588
00:28:34,408 --> 00:28:35,728
I don't think
that comes in a box.

589
00:28:37,144 --> 00:28:39,411
My Christmas Ball is the
most important fundraiser.

590
00:28:45,219 --> 00:28:46,652
So speaking of chickening out,

591
00:28:46,687 --> 00:28:49,288
what were you saying about
hiding in the background again?

592
00:28:49,323 --> 00:28:50,556
It's Mary Bernadette.

593
00:28:51,692 --> 00:28:52,969
Did you forget to get
her a Christmas card?

594
00:28:52,993 --> 00:28:54,960
No, she keeps asking me about

595
00:28:55,062 --> 00:28:57,174
my moms Victorian desk,
she really wants it.

596
00:28:57,198 --> 00:28:59,631
I just don't feel like
talking to her right now.

597
00:29:02,536 --> 00:29:04,436
That's why I live in New York.

598
00:29:04,472 --> 00:29:06,538
Small towns you're always
running into people.

599
00:29:10,444 --> 00:29:11,444
I should probably go.

600
00:29:13,047 --> 00:29:14,324
What about that hot chocolate?

601
00:29:14,348 --> 00:29:18,995
No, I have to meet someone about
one of their market finds. I forgot.

602
00:29:19,019 --> 00:29:20,319
So how about coffee tomorrow?

603
00:29:20,354 --> 00:29:22,387
I can come by the house,
maybe take some pictures?

604
00:29:22,423 --> 00:29:23,188
Okay, yeah.

605
00:29:23,224 --> 00:29:24,356
Okay, alright.

606
00:29:44,879 --> 00:29:46,323
Excuse me.

607
00:29:46,347 --> 00:29:47,112
Hello.

608
00:29:47,148 --> 00:29:48,425
There you are.

609
00:29:48,449 --> 00:29:49,449
Thank you.

610
00:29:50,684 --> 00:29:52,317
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

611
00:29:52,353 --> 00:29:55,387
So, Morgan Shelby.

612
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:57,968
He's cute.

613
00:29:57,992 --> 00:29:59,224
Well, he might be cute,

614
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,560
but he's terrible
at building snowman.

615
00:30:08,602 --> 00:30:09,935
Still calling.

616
00:30:10,037 --> 00:30:12,371
Even worse, I keep finding
myself wanting to answer.

617
00:30:14,141 --> 00:30:15,585
You might need to.

618
00:30:15,609 --> 00:30:16,609
For closure.

619
00:30:32,893 --> 00:30:33,893
Did you know?

620
00:30:35,629 --> 00:30:36,929
I didn't know she had the song.

621
00:30:48,742 --> 00:30:51,944
I so wish mom and dad
were here to see this.

622
00:31:01,455 --> 00:31:02,788
Psst.

623
00:31:02,823 --> 00:31:03,922
Wake up!

624
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:06,692
Oh my goodness!

625
00:31:06,727 --> 00:31:08,460
I've been invaded by tiny elves!

626
00:31:10,364 --> 00:31:11,364
Good morning.

627
00:31:12,666 --> 00:31:14,077
We're gonna put up the Christmas

628
00:31:14,101 --> 00:31:15,045
tree Auntie Emma!

629
00:31:15,069 --> 00:31:16,235
That's right we are.

630
00:31:16,337 --> 00:31:17,636
Three days until Christmas!

631
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:24,109
Race ya!

632
00:31:26,413 --> 00:31:28,814
Three days until Christmas.

633
00:31:37,358 --> 00:31:38,358
You're already here.

634
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,637
I thought I'd
get an early start.

635
00:31:40,661 --> 00:31:41,661
Your sister let me in.

636
00:31:43,197 --> 00:31:44,474
You already have that coffee?

637
00:31:44,498 --> 00:31:45,609
Emma.

638
00:31:45,633 --> 00:31:48,511
Anne Marie made eggnog muffins.

639
00:31:48,535 --> 00:31:49,535
I'm in heaven.

640
00:31:50,304 --> 00:31:51,915
I can't find it anywhere.

641
00:31:51,939 --> 00:31:53,105
Find what?

642
00:31:53,207 --> 00:31:54,172
The key to the
attic storage room.

643
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:55,340
I can't get the tree down...

644
00:31:55,376 --> 00:31:57,075
The key that dad
kept by the back door.

645
00:31:57,111 --> 00:31:58,210
It's not there.

646
00:31:58,245 --> 00:32:00,045
I've looked all over for it.

647
00:32:00,147 --> 00:32:01,547
I don't know what
he's done with it.

648
00:32:02,616 --> 00:32:03,382
What he did with it.

649
00:32:03,417 --> 00:32:04,527
It's fine.

650
00:32:04,551 --> 00:32:06,785
Emma and I can
knock down the door.

651
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:07,953
Yeah.

652
00:32:07,988 --> 00:32:09,354
I can take a look at it.

653
00:32:10,824 --> 00:32:12,991
I happen to pick more
locks than I can count.

654
00:32:13,093 --> 00:32:14,571
My clients are always
losing their keys

655
00:32:14,595 --> 00:32:17,329
to their antique cabinets,
desks, carriage trunks.

656
00:32:18,565 --> 00:32:19,565
I break 'em open.

657
00:32:23,937 --> 00:32:27,450
This is the good part about
being in a small town.

658
00:32:27,474 --> 00:32:29,875
There's always someone around

659
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:30,910
to lend a helping hand.

660
00:32:32,746 --> 00:32:33,746
Touche.

661
00:32:34,915 --> 00:32:36,193
Thank you.

662
00:32:36,317 --> 00:32:37,583
You're welcome.

663
00:32:44,091 --> 00:32:48,093
This is gonna be quite
something when it gets put up.

664
00:32:50,865 --> 00:32:52,164
What if I fall?

665
00:32:52,233 --> 00:32:54,193
Oh I wouldn't let
my Christmas angel fall.

666
00:32:56,971 --> 00:32:58,770
I can reach now.

667
00:32:59,874 --> 00:33:01,206
Oh here we are.

668
00:33:04,245 --> 00:33:05,245
You got it.

669
00:33:08,649 --> 00:33:10,382
Yes, it is.

670
00:33:12,353 --> 00:33:14,253
So who do you spend
Christmas with?

671
00:33:15,256 --> 00:33:16,555
Oh it's just me and my mom.

672
00:33:17,892 --> 00:33:18,892
Yeah.

673
00:33:18,959 --> 00:33:20,103
Before we moved to Oliver's Well

674
00:33:20,127 --> 00:33:23,640
Christmas dinner
was pretty quiet.

675
00:33:23,664 --> 00:33:26,543
Now we have a table
of family and friends.

676
00:33:26,567 --> 00:33:28,000
That sounds lovely.

677
00:33:28,035 --> 00:33:29,134
It is.

678
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:31,803
Mom makes the turkey
and mashed potatoes.

679
00:33:31,872 --> 00:33:33,005
Friends bring the trimmings

680
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,607
and I make the mince
pies and plum pudding.

681
00:33:35,643 --> 00:33:36,643
You do?

682
00:33:38,045 --> 00:33:41,413
Now, are we talking from scratch
or store bought canned tin?

683
00:33:41,448 --> 00:33:42,414
Bite your tongue.

684
00:33:42,449 --> 00:33:44,194
From scratch,
my father taught me.

685
00:33:44,218 --> 00:33:45,218
Really?

686
00:33:46,287 --> 00:33:48,064
Well you are just full
of surprises aren't you?

687
00:33:48,088 --> 00:33:49,354
Yes I am.

688
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:51,590
Would you lend
me a hand with these?

689
00:33:51,625 --> 00:33:52,625
Sure?

690
00:33:56,197 --> 00:33:57,763
You love this don't ya?

691
00:33:57,798 --> 00:33:59,831
Being here, celebrating
with your family.

692
00:33:59,867 --> 00:34:00,867
Yeah, I really do.

693
00:34:01,969 --> 00:34:04,403
I mean I wish my
parents were here but

694
00:34:05,706 --> 00:34:07,839
I feel like they still are.

695
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:11,821
If you don't mind me asking,

696
00:34:11,845 --> 00:34:13,912
why'd you stay away for so long?

697
00:34:13,948 --> 00:34:15,525
I mean you said you
hadn't been back

698
00:34:15,549 --> 00:34:17,627
for Christmas since law school.

699
00:34:17,651 --> 00:34:18,517
Yeah.

700
00:34:18,586 --> 00:34:20,697
It was just life I guess.

701
00:34:20,721 --> 00:34:23,488
How come you moved
to Oliver's Well?

702
00:34:26,527 --> 00:34:29,906
My grandparents lived
here for 30 years.

703
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:32,731
Yeah, my dad moved us
around a lot as kids,

704
00:34:32,833 --> 00:34:35,745
but we always came
here for Christmas.

705
00:34:35,769 --> 00:34:37,703
It was the one
constant in my life.

706
00:34:39,306 --> 00:34:40,973
When I was younger, I...

707
00:34:42,376 --> 00:34:43,175
What?

708
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:44,454
When I was younger,

709
00:34:44,478 --> 00:34:47,057
I actually thought I was
visiting Santa's village.

710
00:34:47,081 --> 00:34:49,014
I thought the same thing!

711
00:34:49,049 --> 00:34:49,948
Yeah?

712
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:51,250
Yeah, because it was so...

713
00:34:51,285 --> 00:34:52,251
Magical.

714
00:34:52,286 --> 00:34:53,352
Yeah.

715
00:34:54,855 --> 00:34:57,067
So jump a bunch
of years forward,

716
00:34:57,091 --> 00:34:58,335
I decide to take a
break from academia

717
00:34:58,359 --> 00:34:59,658
and start my own business.

718
00:34:59,693 --> 00:35:01,960
I thought, why not have
the magic every day?

719
00:35:05,232 --> 00:35:07,132
Funny thing is, I think for me,

720
00:35:07,167 --> 00:35:08,934
my mom and dad were the magic.

721
00:35:59,019 --> 00:36:00,930
Ooh, what's this from?

722
00:36:00,954 --> 00:36:02,054
The camera!

723
00:36:04,191 --> 00:36:06,102
I'd forgotten about this.

724
00:36:06,126 --> 00:36:07,259
What is it?

725
00:36:07,294 --> 00:36:08,827
Every year at
Christmas my family takes

726
00:36:08,862 --> 00:36:11,096
a picture in front of the tree.

727
00:36:11,131 --> 00:36:13,043
Look, this is from
when my mom and dad

728
00:36:13,067 --> 00:36:14,399
first got married.

729
00:36:16,837 --> 00:36:18,704
Auntie Emma has been
here to decorate the tree

730
00:36:18,739 --> 00:36:19,739
for forever.

731
00:36:20,808 --> 00:36:24,109
I was always thinking
about you Sophie.

732
00:36:40,861 --> 00:36:42,994
This is it.

733
00:36:43,097 --> 00:36:44,097
The last one.

734
00:36:45,899 --> 00:36:46,899
Daniel.

735
00:36:50,371 --> 00:36:52,237
This year will be no different.

736
00:36:52,306 --> 00:36:53,306
Come on family.

737
00:36:53,974 --> 00:36:54,639
You want me to?

738
00:36:54,742 --> 00:36:55,607
Yes please.

739
00:36:55,709 --> 00:37:00,545
Alright.

740
00:37:01,081 --> 00:37:02,081
Alright.

741
00:37:02,583 --> 00:37:04,516
Three, two, one!

742
00:37:04,618 --> 00:37:06,062
Merry Christmas!

743
00:37:13,494 --> 00:37:14,304
Let's see.

744
00:37:14,328 --> 00:37:15,927
Let's see how it turns out.

745
00:37:15,963 --> 00:37:17,129
It's developing.

746
00:37:17,197 --> 00:37:18,675
It's gonna take a little while.

747
00:37:22,102 --> 00:37:23,502
That is the third
time in an hour.

748
00:37:23,537 --> 00:37:25,470
Maybe you should
just hit accept.

749
00:37:27,775 --> 00:37:28,775
Go ahead.

750
00:37:31,311 --> 00:37:32,311
Maybe you're right.

751
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,580
Excuse me.

752
00:37:37,117 --> 00:37:38,117
Gotta be patient.

753
00:37:39,219 --> 00:37:41,653
I think it's gonna
be a good one.

754
00:37:43,924 --> 00:37:45,034
Hey.

755
00:37:45,058 --> 00:37:47,926
Hey, you haven't been answering.

756
00:37:47,961 --> 00:37:49,694
Yeah I know, I'm sorry.

757
00:37:50,831 --> 00:37:53,265
But I needed you to
put in this much effort

758
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,900
when we actually were together.

759
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:57,447
Well now
you're just gonna give up

760
00:37:57,471 --> 00:37:58,904
when it gets hard?

761
00:37:58,939 --> 00:38:01,807
Or run away to Oliver's Well
like you ran away to New York?

762
00:38:05,279 --> 00:38:08,647
Sorry, but I can't give
up on you that easy.

763
00:38:08,682 --> 00:38:09,948
Not Emma Reynolds.

764
00:38:11,118 --> 00:38:12,984
Phone calls are easy.

765
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,020
That's not enough.

766
00:38:15,556 --> 00:38:17,856
And I'm not running
away, not this time.

767
00:38:23,363 --> 00:38:24,629
Sorry about that.

768
00:38:24,665 --> 00:38:25,597
Everything okay?

769
00:38:25,632 --> 00:38:27,065
Yeah, recent breakup.

770
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,000
We're still sorting
through some stuff.

771
00:38:29,937 --> 00:38:30,937
It's Morgan isn't it?

772
00:38:30,971 --> 00:38:31,971
Yes sir!

773
00:38:33,407 --> 00:38:35,118
I come bearing news.

774
00:38:35,142 --> 00:38:35,841
Saint Joe.

775
00:38:35,943 --> 00:38:37,108
Thank you.

776
00:38:37,144 --> 00:38:39,322
It's tough to get a cup
of coffee around here.

777
00:38:39,346 --> 00:38:40,779
Yeah.

778
00:38:40,814 --> 00:38:42,892
It seems you may not need a
real estate agent after all.

779
00:38:42,916 --> 00:38:44,216
Oh yeah?

780
00:38:44,318 --> 00:38:45,662
Is someone interested in
buying the house privately?

781
00:38:45,686 --> 00:38:46,985
Young couple.

782
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,032
Edith and Mason's son and
his wife from Pennsylvania,

783
00:38:49,056 --> 00:38:50,522
they've got a baby on the way

784
00:38:50,557 --> 00:38:52,724
and they decided
to move out here.

785
00:38:52,759 --> 00:38:54,693
They'd like to come take
a look at Honeysuckle.

786
00:38:54,728 --> 00:38:55,794
When?

787
00:38:55,829 --> 00:38:56,639
Day after tomorrow.

788
00:38:56,663 --> 00:38:57,440
You're kidding?

789
00:38:57,464 --> 00:38:58,763
Before Christmas?

790
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,144
They're staying with
family for only a week.

791
00:39:01,168 --> 00:39:02,467
The baby is due in February.

792
00:39:02,503 --> 00:39:03,735
They want to move fast.

793
00:39:06,173 --> 00:39:07,417
I thought you'd
be happy with the timeline

794
00:39:07,441 --> 00:39:08,406
given your schedule.

795
00:39:08,442 --> 00:39:09,886
Yeah.

796
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:11,843
I was expecting to have
a little bit more time

797
00:39:11,879 --> 00:39:13,311
to figure out what to keep.

798
00:39:14,748 --> 00:39:16,548
It's all hitting
home now I suppose.

799
00:39:17,985 --> 00:39:18,985
Sorry.

800
00:39:19,586 --> 00:39:20,586
It's gotta be tough.

801
00:39:21,588 --> 00:39:23,788
It's the natural
order of things.

802
00:39:25,259 --> 00:39:27,726
I'm just surprised
it's moving so fast.

803
00:39:27,828 --> 00:39:28,972
Half the time I
came through the door

804
00:39:28,996 --> 00:39:31,696
your mother was
sitting at that desk.

805
00:39:31,732 --> 00:39:33,832
Reading, writing letters.

806
00:39:37,337 --> 00:39:38,803
Joe, since you're here,

807
00:39:38,839 --> 00:39:40,472
do you happen to remember

808
00:39:40,574 --> 00:39:43,520
an old friend of moms by
the name of RJ Dublin?

809
00:39:43,544 --> 00:39:45,110
Morgan found a whole
bunch of letters

810
00:39:45,145 --> 00:39:46,244
from him in the desk.

811
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,380
Yeah, he was a writer
from Oliver's Well.

812
00:39:49,683 --> 00:39:51,583
No, don't recall anyone
by that name.

813
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:53,963
If he lived there,
Georgina at the library

814
00:39:53,987 --> 00:39:54,987
might now who he is.

815
00:39:55,789 --> 00:39:56,599
RJ Dublin?

816
00:39:56,623 --> 00:39:57,956
Yes of course I know him.

817
00:39:58,058 --> 00:40:02,227
RJ Dublin was a pseudonym
used by Gaston Waddleburg.

818
00:40:02,262 --> 00:40:04,029
A bit of a celebrity really.

819
00:40:04,064 --> 00:40:05,964
Because of the scandal.

820
00:40:06,934 --> 00:40:08,133
What scandals that?

821
00:40:08,235 --> 00:40:10,502
Town paper went
wild with the story.

822
00:40:10,537 --> 00:40:13,738
His mother took her children
in the dead of night

823
00:40:13,774 --> 00:40:16,007
and ran away to Ireland.

824
00:40:16,043 --> 00:40:18,410
Which was quite a feat in 1915.

825
00:40:18,445 --> 00:40:20,189
Wait, 1915?

826
00:40:20,213 --> 00:40:21,213
Yes dear.

827
00:40:22,349 --> 00:40:25,850
That would make him way too old
if he was born before 1915.

828
00:40:25,886 --> 00:40:30,533
So, guess
we have hit a dead end.

829
00:40:30,557 --> 00:40:32,524
That was definitely
not the right RJ.

830
00:40:33,427 --> 00:40:34,593
What do you mean?

831
00:40:34,628 --> 00:40:37,529
I mean, we're gonna have to look
somewhere else for answers.

832
00:40:37,564 --> 00:40:40,432
Initials are definitely
not gonna be enough.

833
00:40:44,805 --> 00:40:46,404
Seriously, am I crazy?

834
00:40:47,207 --> 00:40:48,207
Why do I care so much

835
00:40:48,308 --> 00:40:51,910
about letters from
some random man?

836
00:40:51,945 --> 00:40:54,045
So he was some ex-fiance.

837
00:40:54,147 --> 00:40:55,981
So what right?

838
00:40:56,083 --> 00:40:57,226
I think this is
about finding out

839
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:58,817
who your mother was.

840
00:40:58,852 --> 00:41:00,452
Or who I thought she was.

841
00:41:01,321 --> 00:41:03,199
You don't keep letters like this

842
00:41:03,223 --> 00:41:04,990
unless they really
meant something to you.

843
00:41:05,025 --> 00:41:06,636
And you certainly don't
keep them a secret.

844
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:09,027
I don't think she even
told my dad about this.

845
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:12,797
I think your mother wanted
you to find those letters.

846
00:41:15,469 --> 00:41:16,668
What makes you think that?

847
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:18,236
I mean you said she used to hide

848
00:41:18,271 --> 00:41:19,871
presents for you in
the desk drawers.

849
00:41:19,906 --> 00:41:21,306
The Christmas scavenger hunt.

850
00:41:21,341 --> 00:41:23,575
I think maybe

851
00:41:24,878 --> 00:41:27,946
this was one final
gift just for you.

852
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:33,119
I don't know.

853
00:41:34,688 --> 00:41:36,554
It doesn't feel very
much like a gift.

854
00:41:36,657 --> 00:41:37,789
It feels like a burden.

855
00:41:38,925 --> 00:41:40,859
We don't know how
the story ends yet.

856
00:41:45,098 --> 00:41:46,098
You know,

857
00:41:47,367 --> 00:41:49,167
when I first moved
to Oliver's Well,

858
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:51,236
I was seeing someone

859
00:41:51,371 --> 00:41:54,606
and I realized pretty
quickly she wasn't the one.

860
00:41:54,641 --> 00:41:55,641
She knew it too.

861
00:41:57,711 --> 00:41:59,010
But letting go

862
00:42:01,081 --> 00:42:02,847
was so hard.

863
00:42:04,951 --> 00:42:06,751
I think I've kept to myself

864
00:42:08,855 --> 00:42:09,855
because...

865
00:42:10,791 --> 00:42:11,791
Because it's scary.

866
00:42:12,726 --> 00:42:13,726
Caring about someone.

867
00:42:17,531 --> 00:42:18,531
Yeah.

868
00:42:19,666 --> 00:42:22,133
I think I was waiting
for someone to remind me

869
00:42:22,235 --> 00:42:23,401
that it was worth it.

870
00:42:26,807 --> 00:42:27,939
Oh no!

871
00:42:31,011 --> 00:42:32,011
Oh no.

872
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:33,056
They're okay.

873
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:33,845
I think they're okay.

874
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:34,579
You do?

875
00:42:34,681 --> 00:42:35,681
Yes.

876
00:42:39,086 --> 00:42:40,086
See, no damage.

877
00:42:47,194 --> 00:42:48,194
Wait.

878
00:42:49,463 --> 00:42:52,630
I don't think I ever saw
this postscript before.

879
00:42:52,666 --> 00:42:56,201
"PS, the only photograph I
have where I do not look dour."

880
00:42:58,305 --> 00:42:59,437
There's a photograph.

881
00:42:59,473 --> 00:43:01,172
He gave her a photo!

882
00:43:01,208 --> 00:43:02,974
That's more than initials!

883
00:43:03,009 --> 00:43:04,009
Yeah.

884
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:16,556
Aunt Em.

885
00:43:16,791 --> 00:43:17,791
Hey!

886
00:43:18,726 --> 00:43:19,992
What are you guys up to?

887
00:43:20,028 --> 00:43:22,740
We are looking for
grandma's angels.

888
00:43:22,764 --> 00:43:25,009
It's not Christmas without
those beautiful gold angels.

889
00:43:25,033 --> 00:43:26,033
What are you doing?

890
00:43:27,001 --> 00:43:29,101
Just looking through
some of moms old things.

891
00:43:33,074 --> 00:43:34,707
I swear, that woman
kept everything.

892
00:43:37,145 --> 00:43:38,744
Ooh!

893
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:39,780
Check this out.

894
00:43:40,982 --> 00:43:42,782
I love that she kept that.

895
00:43:42,817 --> 00:43:43,749
What is it?

896
00:43:43,785 --> 00:43:45,051
Wait til you see.

897
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:51,557
Is that grandma's wedding dress?

898
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,393
My god, she was so tiny.

899
00:43:54,429 --> 00:43:55,561
I know.

900
00:43:59,133 --> 00:44:02,001
You know, grandma
was studying fine arts.

901
00:44:02,036 --> 00:44:04,303
Just like you when
she met grandpa.

902
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,318
Actually not
staying in fine arts.

903
00:44:08,342 --> 00:44:10,109
I'm switching to pre-med.

904
00:44:13,381 --> 00:44:15,092
When did you decide that?

905
00:44:15,116 --> 00:44:17,061
Well I've been taking the
science courses as electives

906
00:44:17,085 --> 00:44:18,684
and acing all of them, so...

907
00:44:22,757 --> 00:44:24,690
That's fantastic Rumi.

908
00:44:24,792 --> 00:44:26,392
Congratulations.

909
00:44:26,427 --> 00:44:27,126
I'm sorry.

910
00:44:27,228 --> 00:44:28,672
I'm so proud.

911
00:44:28,696 --> 00:44:31,330
I'm just surprised.

912
00:44:31,432 --> 00:44:32,732
Apparently not a good surprise.

913
00:44:33,835 --> 00:44:35,000
Rumi, hold on.

914
00:44:35,036 --> 00:44:36,936
So much for being able
to tell you anything.

915
00:44:41,809 --> 00:44:42,809
Andie.

916
00:44:44,178 --> 00:44:45,189
Going to medical
school isn't exactly

917
00:44:45,213 --> 00:44:47,012
the worst form of rebellion.

918
00:44:47,115 --> 00:44:48,881
Of course not, it's just...

919
00:44:51,652 --> 00:44:53,419
She didn't tell me.

920
00:44:55,389 --> 00:44:56,689
She didn't discuss it with me.

921
00:45:00,561 --> 00:45:03,329
And now she might be
going to med school.

922
00:45:03,431 --> 00:45:06,365
She's gonna be
across the country.

923
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,300
Yeah.

924
00:45:08,336 --> 00:45:10,035
You're gonna be alright.

925
00:45:10,071 --> 00:45:10,881
You both are.

926
00:45:10,905 --> 00:45:12,483
It's just,

927
00:45:12,507 --> 00:45:15,541
New York was only
a few hours away

928
00:45:15,576 --> 00:45:18,010
and you lost touch
with mom and dad.

929
00:45:20,748 --> 00:45:22,214
You were so close
before you left.

930
00:45:23,818 --> 00:45:25,262
Rumi doesn't have to move away

931
00:45:25,286 --> 00:45:26,597
to know how much
she loves it here

932
00:45:26,621 --> 00:45:27,820
if she already does.

933
00:45:29,791 --> 00:45:30,923
What do you mean?

934
00:45:30,958 --> 00:45:32,391
I've been thinking
about it lately.

935
00:45:34,495 --> 00:45:36,729
I really wish I hadn't
stayed away so long.

936
00:45:38,399 --> 00:45:39,532
I missed out on a lot.

937
00:45:40,835 --> 00:45:41,835
I know that.

938
00:45:46,474 --> 00:45:48,218
I should probably go downstairs.

939
00:45:48,242 --> 00:45:50,142
I think Morgan's
maybe here by now.

940
00:45:51,145 --> 00:45:51,977
Yeah, I'm just...

941
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:53,112
You go.

942
00:45:53,247 --> 00:45:54,625
I'm gonna stay up here
and spend some more

943
00:45:54,649 --> 00:45:56,182
time with moms things.

944
00:46:00,021 --> 00:46:01,821
- Bye.
- Bye.

945
00:46:06,327 --> 00:46:08,093
Why are you here Mr. Morgan?

946
00:46:08,129 --> 00:46:10,841
Well, I'm helping Aunt
Emma with her house.

947
00:46:10,865 --> 00:46:12,431
Why?

948
00:46:12,466 --> 00:46:16,001
Because I have a special
knowledge of old things.

949
00:46:16,037 --> 00:46:17,203
Why?

950
00:46:17,305 --> 00:46:19,271
Because I think it's
important to learn

951
00:46:19,307 --> 00:46:20,673
and remember from the past.

952
00:46:20,708 --> 00:46:22,148
Like for example,
what you're making?

953
00:46:22,176 --> 00:46:25,077
I'm making a star to
put on top of the tree.

954
00:46:25,112 --> 00:46:28,013
Do you guys know what they
used to decorate trees with?

955
00:46:28,115 --> 00:46:29,982
Did they put paper snowflakes?

956
00:46:30,051 --> 00:46:31,051
No.

957
00:46:31,886 --> 00:46:32,818
Popcorn!

958
00:46:32,854 --> 00:46:33,964
Close, close, warmer.

959
00:46:33,988 --> 00:46:35,588
You know what it was?

960
00:46:35,623 --> 00:46:36,623
Food.

961
00:46:37,558 --> 00:46:38,302
What!

962
00:46:38,326 --> 00:46:39,603
Yes!

963
00:46:39,627 --> 00:46:42,394
They used to put candy canes,
gingerbread shapes,

964
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:44,363
like apples painted with gold.

965
00:46:44,465 --> 00:46:45,431
Yum.

966
00:46:45,466 --> 00:46:46,243
Delicious right?

967
00:46:46,267 --> 00:46:47,845
Hey kids.

968
00:46:47,869 --> 00:46:50,436
What exactly have you roped

969
00:46:50,471 --> 00:46:52,071
Mr. Shelby into?

970
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,919
I found out that the
Reynold's Christmases

971
00:46:55,943 --> 00:46:57,042
are very hands on.

972
00:47:01,282 --> 00:47:03,549
Look, what I found.

973
00:47:03,584 --> 00:47:05,818
This was in the attic.

974
00:47:06,621 --> 00:47:08,287
In my moms hope chest.

975
00:47:09,857 --> 00:47:11,768
This is RJ.

976
00:47:11,792 --> 00:47:12,591
Yeah.

977
00:47:12,627 --> 00:47:13,559
Do you recognize it.

978
00:47:13,594 --> 00:47:15,339
Unfortunately no.

979
00:47:15,363 --> 00:47:17,296
I haven't shown 'em
to anybody else yet.

980
00:47:19,567 --> 00:47:20,699
Anyway.

981
00:47:20,735 --> 00:47:21,735
Oh yeah, yeah.

982
00:47:27,275 --> 00:47:29,208
I broke the other one of these.

983
00:47:31,345 --> 00:47:32,645
We had a fight.

984
00:47:33,915 --> 00:47:35,214
My mom and me.

985
00:47:35,249 --> 00:47:36,715
It was before I moved
to New York.

986
00:47:36,817 --> 00:47:38,117
Right after law school.

987
00:47:40,721 --> 00:47:42,721
That's the reason
why I never came back

988
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:44,323
for Christmas after that.

989
00:47:44,425 --> 00:47:47,504
My dad offered me the
opportunity to work with him

990
00:47:47,528 --> 00:47:48,528
at the Reynolds firm.

991
00:47:50,431 --> 00:47:51,431
But I said no.

992
00:47:52,366 --> 00:47:53,866
I wanted to move to New York.

993
00:47:56,203 --> 00:47:59,271
My mother made me feel like
I was breaking my fathers heart.

994
00:48:01,742 --> 00:48:05,778
I said some horrible,
awful things to her.

995
00:48:09,183 --> 00:48:11,617
Our relationship was never
the same after that.

996
00:48:14,021 --> 00:48:16,088
She just wanted you
to come home.

997
00:48:16,123 --> 00:48:17,256
I know that now.

998
00:48:18,592 --> 00:48:20,826
And I know she regretted it
just as much as I did.

999
00:48:21,996 --> 00:48:25,864
Neither one of us ever
apologized to the other.

1000
00:48:25,967 --> 00:48:27,800
We were just too stubborn.

1001
00:48:27,902 --> 00:48:31,804
It was easier I guess
to just stay away.

1002
00:48:34,075 --> 00:48:36,208
I wasted so much time.

1003
00:48:37,778 --> 00:48:38,778
And now she's gone.

1004
00:48:40,848 --> 00:48:41,848
Parents and children,

1005
00:48:43,784 --> 00:48:45,028
they fight.

1006
00:48:45,052 --> 00:48:46,052
It happens.

1007
00:48:48,022 --> 00:48:50,923
It's funny, I've never told
anybody about that fight.

1008
00:48:51,025 --> 00:48:52,025
That's okay.

1009
00:48:52,827 --> 00:48:54,393
Another secret
that's safe with me.

1010
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:56,730
Thanks.

1011
00:49:00,301 --> 00:49:01,233
Ian, hi.

1012
00:49:01,268 --> 00:49:02,534
Hey, how are you?

1013
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:03,469
I'm good.

1014
00:49:03,504 --> 00:49:04,970
I didn't know you were coming.

1015
00:49:05,072 --> 00:49:06,839
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

1016
00:49:06,874 --> 00:49:08,540
- Hey!
- Uncle Ian!

1017
00:49:08,642 --> 00:49:10,809
Oh merry Christmas!

1018
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:11,710
Ian, your Ian?

1019
00:49:11,746 --> 00:49:12,544
Yeah.

1020
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:13,679
No, I mean no.

1021
00:49:13,714 --> 00:49:15,414
I mean yes,
but he's not my Ian anymore.

1022
00:49:15,449 --> 00:49:17,060
Don't open them okay?

1023
00:49:17,084 --> 00:49:18,851
- Hey!
- Hey!

1024
00:49:20,121 --> 00:49:21,453
It's a Christmas miracle.

1025
00:49:25,159 --> 00:49:26,526
He's driven all this way.

1026
00:49:26,561 --> 00:49:27,226
We broke up.

1027
00:49:27,262 --> 00:49:28,461
I didn't invite him.

1028
00:49:28,496 --> 00:49:29,807
Don't look at me,
I didn't either.

1029
00:49:29,831 --> 00:49:31,709
Well I told him I didn't...

1030
00:49:31,733 --> 00:49:32,733
Oh no.

1031
00:49:32,834 --> 00:49:33,966
What?

1032
00:49:34,035 --> 00:49:36,736
I told him I didn't want
more phone calls.

1033
00:49:36,771 --> 00:49:38,048
Well this certainly
isn't a phone call.

1034
00:49:38,072 --> 00:49:39,072
No it's not.

1035
00:49:45,346 --> 00:49:47,613
Ian Tillman, cardiologist.

1036
00:49:47,715 --> 00:49:50,016
Morgan Shelby, antiques.

1037
00:49:51,452 --> 00:49:53,286
So how do you know
the family Morgan?

1038
00:49:53,388 --> 00:49:54,832
I'm helping Emma.

1039
00:49:54,856 --> 00:49:56,155
You know, with the house.

1040
00:49:58,092 --> 00:49:59,169
What are you talking about?

1041
00:49:59,193 --> 00:50:00,004
No, of course
it doesn't have anything

1042
00:50:00,028 --> 00:50:01,694
to do with Morgan Shelby.

1043
00:50:01,763 --> 00:50:03,229
I only just met him.

1044
00:50:03,264 --> 00:50:05,731
Morgan loves Oliver's Well.

1045
00:50:05,833 --> 00:50:07,466
He's not gonna chase you
to New York.

1046
00:50:08,736 --> 00:50:11,148
Clearly Ian's not giving up
so easily.

1047
00:50:11,172 --> 00:50:12,805
Doesn't that say something?

1048
00:50:15,843 --> 00:50:17,310
A lot of money in antiques?

1049
00:50:18,313 --> 00:50:19,412
Not in it for the paycheck.

1050
00:50:19,447 --> 00:50:20,880
Right, right.

1051
00:50:22,784 --> 00:50:24,417
Emma tells me you two broke up.

1052
00:50:24,452 --> 00:50:26,852
We're just going through
a little rough patch.

1053
00:50:26,888 --> 00:50:28,299
But I think
that her Christmas present

1054
00:50:28,323 --> 00:50:30,067
might change things.

1055
00:50:30,091 --> 00:50:31,057
For the better.

1056
00:50:31,092 --> 00:50:33,192
Ian, were we expecting you?

1057
00:50:33,294 --> 00:50:36,429
I was hoping it would be
a Christmas surprise.

1058
00:50:36,531 --> 00:50:37,997
So many of those this year.

1059
00:50:41,769 --> 00:50:43,035
I'll give you guys some space.

1060
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:44,937
It was nice to meet you.

1061
00:50:44,973 --> 00:50:47,217
Emma, why don't I show
Ian where the guestroom is.

1062
00:50:47,241 --> 00:50:48,407
Good idea, thank you.

1063
00:50:48,476 --> 00:50:49,476
Okay.

1064
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:50,510
Alright.

1065
00:50:51,779 --> 00:50:52,912
Hey Morgan.

1066
00:50:54,315 --> 00:50:56,427
Wait, you don't have to go.

1067
00:50:56,451 --> 00:50:59,151
Well, you might have
some catching up to do.

1068
00:50:59,187 --> 00:51:01,087
No, I didn't invite him here.

1069
00:51:01,122 --> 00:51:02,788
He came after me.

1070
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:06,270
I know but he's not giving up.

1071
00:51:06,294 --> 00:51:07,927
And I can't fault him.

1072
00:51:08,863 --> 00:51:09,528
Get inside.

1073
00:51:09,564 --> 00:51:10,564
Before you freeze.

1074
00:51:14,836 --> 00:51:15,836
Okay.

1075
00:51:24,545 --> 00:51:26,379
It's good to see you Em.

1076
00:51:27,348 --> 00:51:28,348
You look good.

1077
00:51:29,751 --> 00:51:30,916
Chilled.

1078
00:51:31,019 --> 00:51:32,685
Ian, what are you doing here?

1079
00:51:35,890 --> 00:51:38,591
Look, if you want
me to go, I'll split.

1080
00:51:38,626 --> 00:51:39,759
But I had to try.

1081
00:51:43,831 --> 00:51:45,398
Now come on Em.

1082
00:51:45,433 --> 00:51:46,832
It's practically Christmas Eve.

1083
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:51,382
I mean okay, fine Ian.

1084
00:51:51,406 --> 00:51:53,339
You can stay for one night.

1085
00:51:53,374 --> 00:51:54,618
Good.

1086
00:51:54,642 --> 00:51:55,642
Thank you.

1087
00:51:59,981 --> 00:52:01,414
This is a great house.

1088
00:52:03,217 --> 00:52:04,617
I always forget how great it is.

1089
00:52:18,733 --> 00:52:21,767
So my ex-boyfriend is downstairs

1090
00:52:21,803 --> 00:52:24,837
basically saying he is
here to win me back.

1091
00:52:26,808 --> 00:52:28,074
It's quite romantic.

1092
00:52:30,011 --> 00:52:31,422
But it doesn't make
a lick of difference

1093
00:52:31,446 --> 00:52:32,745
if you don't love him.

1094
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:33,780
I do love him.

1095
00:52:34,882 --> 00:52:35,648
I did.

1096
00:52:35,683 --> 00:52:36,683
I don't know.

1097
00:52:37,618 --> 00:52:40,653
I just wanted a sign,
I wanted some clarity.

1098
00:52:40,688 --> 00:52:42,922
Now I feel more confused.

1099
00:52:42,957 --> 00:52:44,735
Well I would just
like to point out there

1100
00:52:44,759 --> 00:52:47,793
are zero men after me right now.

1101
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:49,895
Zero.

1102
00:53:00,408 --> 00:53:01,574
Who is this handsome fellow?

1103
00:53:05,313 --> 00:53:07,991
Mom was gonna leave
Oliver's Well?

1104
00:53:08,015 --> 00:53:08,981
Did you read this?

1105
00:53:09,016 --> 00:53:10,016
Yeah.

1106
00:53:10,084 --> 00:53:11,617
Move to Chicago.

1107
00:53:11,719 --> 00:53:13,352
I had no idea she'd
ever even consider

1108
00:53:13,387 --> 00:53:14,387
something like that.

1109
00:53:16,724 --> 00:53:18,502
We're not gonna share
this with Daniel are we?

1110
00:53:18,526 --> 00:53:19,970
No.

1111
00:53:19,994 --> 00:53:21,093
Not at Christmastime.

1112
00:53:25,032 --> 00:53:26,799
Anyway, I've hit a dead end now.

1113
00:53:26,901 --> 00:53:27,901
Photo or not.

1114
00:53:29,504 --> 00:53:31,570
Why wouldn't she
tell us about him?

1115
00:53:31,606 --> 00:53:33,906
Well, Morgan thinks
maybe she left the

1116
00:53:34,008 --> 00:53:36,475
letters in her desk on
purpose for me to find.

1117
00:53:37,912 --> 00:53:39,022
Like...

1118
00:53:39,046 --> 00:53:40,446
Like your Christmas
scavenger hunts.

1119
00:53:45,019 --> 00:53:48,387
Mom always tried to help us
avoid mistakes she made.

1120
00:53:48,422 --> 00:53:51,190
Maybe RJ was a mistake.

1121
00:53:54,562 --> 00:53:55,995
Wait, does that mean you think I

1122
00:53:56,030 --> 00:53:57,608
should go back to Ian?

1123
00:53:57,632 --> 00:53:59,532
It means you should
stop worrying about

1124
00:53:59,567 --> 00:54:00,733
what other people think.

1125
00:54:02,503 --> 00:54:03,636
Trust yourself.

1126
00:54:04,872 --> 00:54:07,506
If it's a mistake,
you learn from it.

1127
00:54:10,912 --> 00:54:13,612
Maybe you should trust Rumi too.

1128
00:54:18,352 --> 00:54:20,286
Being a mother
is ridiculously hard.

1129
00:54:26,427 --> 00:54:27,860
I wish mom were here.

1130
00:54:29,497 --> 00:54:30,497
Me too.

1131
00:54:32,834 --> 00:54:34,200
With all my heart.

1132
00:54:35,603 --> 00:54:36,435
Alright.

1133
00:54:36,470 --> 00:54:37,770
Who is hungry?

1134
00:54:37,872 --> 00:54:38,872
Me!

1135
00:54:40,808 --> 00:54:42,886
Those look good, right Sophie?

1136
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:44,655
Here ya go buddy.

1137
00:54:44,679 --> 00:54:45,845
The Christmas tree!

1138
00:54:45,947 --> 00:54:47,146
Me next, me next, me next!

1139
00:54:47,248 --> 00:54:48,681
Here.

1140
00:54:48,716 --> 00:54:49,993
I told them I'm usually
king of the kitchen,

1141
00:54:50,017 --> 00:54:52,117
but he insisted.

1142
00:54:52,153 --> 00:54:53,586
Oh you need a
break sometimes man.

1143
00:54:53,688 --> 00:54:56,755
Plus, these are a
bit of a specialty.

1144
00:54:56,791 --> 00:54:59,758
Thank you.

1145
00:54:59,827 --> 00:55:01,827
Oh no thanks.

1146
00:55:01,863 --> 00:55:04,708
Alright family,
eat 'em while they're hot.

1147
00:55:04,732 --> 00:55:05,831
These taste funny.

1148
00:55:06,834 --> 00:55:08,400
Like play-doh.

1149
00:55:08,436 --> 00:55:10,102
Kids, don't be rude.

1150
00:55:10,171 --> 00:55:11,303
They're gluten-free.

1151
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:14,273
I think they're delicious.

1152
00:55:14,308 --> 00:55:16,876
Well, they're your
Auntie Emma's favorite.

1153
00:55:16,978 --> 00:55:18,110
Actually no.

1154
00:55:21,082 --> 00:55:22,960
I never wanted to
hurt your feelings

1155
00:55:22,984 --> 00:55:26,085
but I prefer pancakes
made the old fashion way.

1156
00:55:28,956 --> 00:55:29,956
Good to know.

1157
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:34,159
So what time is that
couple coming over

1158
00:55:34,262 --> 00:55:35,405
to see the house?

1159
00:55:35,429 --> 00:55:36,707
Around 11.

1160
00:55:36,731 --> 00:55:39,498
Anne Marie and I have to be at
the Bernadette house at noon.

1161
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:42,868
And we need Andie
to watch the kids.

1162
00:55:44,338 --> 00:55:46,438
Well, Emma and I
can show them around.

1163
00:55:46,474 --> 00:55:47,217
No problem.

1164
00:55:47,241 --> 00:55:48,173
Right?

1165
00:55:48,209 --> 00:55:49,541
Yeah, yeah.

1166
00:55:49,610 --> 00:55:50,610
Absolutely.

1167
00:55:52,246 --> 00:55:54,647
You'll notice the
excellent detailing here.

1168
00:55:56,117 --> 00:55:58,918
There's lots of room in this
house for a family to grow.

1169
00:56:00,187 --> 00:56:00,964
The dining room.

1170
00:56:00,988 --> 00:56:02,288
Yes, the dining room.

1171
00:56:33,788 --> 00:56:34,788
You alright?

1172
00:56:36,424 --> 00:56:39,158
A little hard watching
a family in the house.

1173
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:40,592
Yeah.

1174
00:56:40,695 --> 00:56:42,061
It is, unexpectedly so.

1175
00:56:42,163 --> 00:56:44,608
Well it is a beautiful house.

1176
00:56:44,632 --> 00:56:45,876
And if I was living
in the country

1177
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:47,644
I couldn't imagine a
better place to call home.

1178
00:56:47,668 --> 00:56:50,903
It's funny, lately
I've been wondering

1179
00:56:50,938 --> 00:56:52,538
what if I did live
in the country?

1180
00:56:54,675 --> 00:56:57,242
No, Oliver's Well was
suffocating for you remember?

1181
00:56:57,345 --> 00:56:59,345
Yeah, it was.

1182
00:57:01,082 --> 00:57:03,215
I don't know, dreams change.

1183
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:04,494
I've been realizing maybe I need

1184
00:57:04,518 --> 00:57:06,585
to be flexible enough
to change with them.

1185
00:57:07,588 --> 00:57:08,588
Emma.

1186
00:57:11,125 --> 00:57:12,125
It was my fault.

1187
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:14,693
Us breaking up.

1188
00:57:16,163 --> 00:57:18,041
I got scared.

1189
00:57:18,065 --> 00:57:18,864
Scared?

1190
00:57:18,899 --> 00:57:19,899
Of what?

1191
00:57:20,668 --> 00:57:21,668
Of commitment.

1192
00:57:22,570 --> 00:57:23,570
Of tradition.

1193
00:57:24,739 --> 00:57:25,838
Of settling down.

1194
00:57:27,241 --> 00:57:28,574
I'm not scared anymore though.

1195
00:57:30,077 --> 00:57:32,177
Now I was gonna wait 'til
tomorrow to do this but

1196
00:57:33,881 --> 00:57:35,993
I've waited long enough already.

1197
00:57:36,017 --> 00:57:37,282
Ian.

1198
00:57:37,318 --> 00:57:39,752
Emma Reynolds,
will you marry me?

1199
00:57:41,856 --> 00:57:43,767
You said you always needed
commitment and romance,

1200
00:57:43,791 --> 00:57:45,024
and you're right.

1201
00:57:45,059 --> 00:57:46,025
I can do that.

1202
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:47,192
Ian this is...

1203
00:57:47,294 --> 00:57:48,605
You don't have to answer now.

1204
00:57:48,629 --> 00:57:49,629
Think about it.

1205
00:57:50,698 --> 00:57:53,332
It's a shock, I
know, I'm not stupid.

1206
00:57:54,735 --> 00:57:57,669
But love isn't always as easy
as your folks made it seem.

1207
00:57:58,506 --> 00:58:00,739
Plus, this is always

1208
00:58:00,775 --> 00:58:02,975
kind of how you
imagined it isn't it?

1209
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:05,411
Christmastime, mistletoe.

1210
00:58:07,348 --> 00:58:08,814
I mean yes, it is.

1211
00:58:13,821 --> 00:58:14,821
Ian!

1212
00:58:15,623 --> 00:58:16,922
What are you...

1213
00:58:18,859 --> 00:58:21,126
- What do you mean?
- I didn't say yes.

1214
00:58:22,530 --> 00:58:23,395
It's stuck!

1215
00:58:23,497 --> 00:58:24,463
The ring is stuck.

1216
00:58:24,498 --> 00:58:25,764
It won't come off.

1217
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:27,244
Emma?

1218
00:58:27,268 --> 00:58:28,268
Emma?

1219
00:58:28,369 --> 00:58:29,168
Ian?

1220
00:58:29,203 --> 00:58:30,203
Yeah?

1221
00:58:31,172 --> 00:58:32,771
It's practically a blizzard
out there.

1222
00:58:32,873 --> 00:58:33,873
Daniel just called.

1223
00:58:33,908 --> 00:58:34,973
He's nearly incoherent.

1224
00:58:35,009 --> 00:58:37,476
Something happened
with the servers.

1225
00:58:37,578 --> 00:58:38,722
We need to get there.

1226
00:58:38,746 --> 00:58:40,712
- Okay.
- Okay.

1227
00:58:49,123 --> 00:58:51,090
I haven't been here in so long

1228
00:58:51,192 --> 00:58:53,025
I don't even remember
where the kitchen is.

1229
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:55,094
Ian, would you take our coats?

1230
00:58:55,129 --> 00:58:55,928
Yes.

1231
00:58:55,963 --> 00:58:57,096
Find some place to put them.

1232
00:58:57,198 --> 00:58:57,896
Yeah, whatever you need.

1233
00:58:57,998 --> 00:58:59,431
Thank you.

1234
00:58:59,467 --> 00:59:00,467
Welcome.

1235
00:59:02,803 --> 00:59:03,803
Thanks.

1236
00:59:05,272 --> 00:59:07,239
Something happened
during that house tour.

1237
00:59:07,341 --> 00:59:08,840
Thank goodness you're here.

1238
00:59:08,876 --> 00:59:10,253
Uncle Daniel is losing
his mind about the waiters.

1239
00:59:10,277 --> 00:59:12,088
- What about the waiters?
- Just, we just need to go.

1240
00:59:12,112 --> 00:59:14,179
They're stuck, in Charlotte.

1241
00:59:14,214 --> 00:59:15,747
All my catering
staff are snowed in.

1242
00:59:15,783 --> 00:59:17,048
Take a breath Daniel.

1243
00:59:17,084 --> 00:59:18,495
Take a breath?

1244
00:59:18,519 --> 00:59:20,952
This is the historical societies
biggest event of the year.

1245
00:59:20,988 --> 00:59:22,232
It needs to be flawless.

1246
00:59:22,256 --> 00:59:24,489
Since when is
anything ever flawless?

1247
00:59:24,525 --> 00:59:26,069
And Anne Marie and the
kids are at her parents.

1248
00:59:26,093 --> 00:59:27,125
They're snowed in too.

1249
00:59:28,395 --> 00:59:29,227
If we ruin this...

1250
00:59:29,329 --> 00:59:31,263
It won't be ruined Daniel.

1251
00:59:31,298 --> 00:59:32,464
What are you doing?

1252
00:59:32,566 --> 00:59:34,511
Andie and I both
waitressed in high school.

1253
00:59:34,535 --> 00:59:37,969
Rumi, you just need to give
me a little refresher course.

1254
00:59:38,038 --> 00:59:38,904
Don't spill.

1255
00:59:38,939 --> 00:59:40,205
And don't eat all the food.

1256
00:59:40,307 --> 00:59:41,173
Okay.

1257
00:59:41,208 --> 00:59:42,118
No, Mary Bernadette will know.

1258
00:59:42,142 --> 00:59:43,742
So pretend it was planned.

1259
00:59:43,777 --> 00:59:45,822
People are gonna love seeing
the Reynolds sister serving.

1260
00:59:45,846 --> 00:59:47,446
Come on Daniel.

1261
00:59:47,481 --> 00:59:50,360
Isn't this exactly what our
parents would have done?

1262
00:59:50,384 --> 00:59:52,150
When things don't
go exactly as planned,

1263
00:59:52,186 --> 00:59:53,485
that's when the magic happens.

1264
00:59:56,990 --> 00:59:58,089
Emma,

1265
00:59:58,125 --> 00:59:59,291
what is that on your finger?

1266
00:59:59,393 --> 01:00:00,370
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1267
01:00:00,394 --> 01:00:01,159
No, no, no.

1268
01:00:01,195 --> 01:00:03,128
That's, this is stuck.

1269
01:00:03,163 --> 01:00:04,296
This is not.

1270
01:00:14,942 --> 01:00:16,274
Fresh from the oven.

1271
01:00:18,345 --> 01:00:20,612
Hey, so what happened?

1272
01:00:20,647 --> 01:00:22,380
He proposed but
I didn't say yes.

1273
01:00:22,416 --> 01:00:24,182
Does Ian know that?

1274
01:00:24,284 --> 01:00:25,595
Yes, he said I
could think about it

1275
01:00:25,619 --> 01:00:27,385
but then the ring got stuck

1276
01:00:27,421 --> 01:00:28,832
and then you came in.

1277
01:00:28,856 --> 01:00:31,256
Sweetie, if you have
to think about it,

1278
01:00:31,291 --> 01:00:32,924
isn't that an answer?

1279
01:00:34,862 --> 01:00:36,261
Excuse me.

1280
01:01:40,127 --> 01:01:41,860
You came.

1281
01:01:41,895 --> 01:01:43,528
You look beautiful.

1282
01:01:45,799 --> 01:01:46,799
Thank you.

1283
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:52,704
You do realize this is
a Christmas party right?

1284
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:57,409
Dancing, people, socializing.

1285
01:01:57,444 --> 01:01:59,044
Not really your thing right?

1286
01:01:59,846 --> 01:02:02,614
Somebody once told me I need
to stop hiding in the background

1287
01:02:02,716 --> 01:02:04,683
and get out of my comfort zone.

1288
01:02:07,588 --> 01:02:09,220
Morgan.

1289
01:02:09,256 --> 01:02:10,722
I found him.

1290
01:02:10,791 --> 01:02:12,268
I found RJ.

1291
01:02:12,292 --> 01:02:13,425
You're kidding?

1292
01:02:14,561 --> 01:02:15,527
Where? Here?

1293
01:02:15,562 --> 01:02:16,306
Yeah.

1294
01:02:16,330 --> 01:02:17,095
Where?

1295
01:02:17,130 --> 01:02:18,130
The photo of him.

1296
01:02:20,067 --> 01:02:21,833
Saint Nicks Christmas Shop.

1297
01:02:22,803 --> 01:02:25,048
Bobby and Rachel Jacobs.

1298
01:02:25,072 --> 01:02:26,638
Bobby, Robert.

1299
01:02:27,808 --> 01:02:28,907
Robert Jacobs.

1300
01:02:28,976 --> 01:02:33,478
That is one of my
favorite photos of us.

1301
01:02:33,513 --> 01:02:35,847
It was the first Christmas
we opened the shop.

1302
01:02:36,984 --> 01:02:39,484
RJ, RJ was your husband.

1303
01:02:39,586 --> 01:02:42,887
RJ, I haven't
heard that in years.

1304
01:02:42,956 --> 01:02:44,233
You know, he started
going by Bobby

1305
01:02:44,257 --> 01:02:45,757
after we were married.

1306
01:02:45,792 --> 01:02:50,239
Rachel and RJ, just
sounded too cute for him.

1307
01:02:50,263 --> 01:02:53,009
So how did you two meet?

1308
01:02:53,033 --> 01:02:55,166
Your mother introduced us.

1309
01:02:55,268 --> 01:02:57,046
It's one of the reasons
why we kept making

1310
01:02:57,070 --> 01:02:59,004
those blue ribbon wreaths.

1311
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:00,583
She started it all.

1312
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:04,643
Mrs. Jacobs, Emma and
I found some letters.

1313
01:03:04,678 --> 01:03:08,858
Love letters from an old
fiance we never knew about.

1314
01:03:08,882 --> 01:03:11,928
Well, it is the true beginning

1315
01:03:11,952 --> 01:03:15,854
that always gets left out
of their famous love story.

1316
01:03:15,956 --> 01:03:19,357
But, it doesn't seem like
now's the time to tell it.

1317
01:03:19,393 --> 01:03:21,960
Would you like to come
over to the house later?

1318
01:03:21,995 --> 01:03:24,207
I have to leave right
after Christmas.

1319
01:03:24,231 --> 01:03:25,864
I would love that.

1320
01:03:25,966 --> 01:03:29,668
I have seen 32 Honeysuckle
Lane in a long while.

1321
01:03:29,703 --> 01:03:31,648
But now I think I'm
gonna go track down

1322
01:03:31,672 --> 01:03:33,238
one of those delicious quiche.

1323
01:03:33,273 --> 01:03:33,905
Okay.

1324
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:34,717
I'll see you later.

1325
01:03:34,741 --> 01:03:35,741
Yes.

1326
01:03:36,977 --> 01:03:37,942
Well that's not where I thought

1327
01:03:37,978 --> 01:03:39,055
the evening was going.

1328
01:03:39,079 --> 01:03:40,879
I've made a pretty big decision.

1329
01:03:40,914 --> 01:03:42,291
About?

1330
01:03:42,315 --> 01:03:43,782
Morgan!

1331
01:03:43,817 --> 01:03:44,716
Hi.

1332
01:03:44,751 --> 01:03:46,317
- I thought I lost ya.
- Never.

1333
01:03:46,353 --> 01:03:47,285
Emma, do you know Maureen?

1334
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:48,753
Of course.
Emma you look gorgeous.

1335
01:03:48,789 --> 01:03:50,221
Oh, well.

1336
01:03:50,257 --> 01:03:52,323
The apron wasn't really
part of the outfit,

1337
01:03:52,359 --> 01:03:54,570
but we Reynolds never do
anything according to plan.

1338
01:03:54,594 --> 01:03:55,927
Is that?

1339
01:03:56,029 --> 01:03:58,797
Oh my gosh, that
ring is stunning.

1340
01:03:58,832 --> 01:04:00,098
Congratulations.

1341
01:04:03,637 --> 01:04:05,236
So, who's the lucky man?

1342
01:04:06,239 --> 01:04:07,016
Well it just happened.

1343
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:08,317
I haven't actually...

1344
01:04:08,341 --> 01:04:09,752
A Christmas proposal
is almost as romantic

1345
01:04:09,776 --> 01:04:11,220
as a Christmas wedding.

1346
01:04:11,244 --> 01:04:12,577
Congratulations Emma.

1347
01:04:12,679 --> 01:04:14,479
I'm very happy for you and Ian.

1348
01:04:15,982 --> 01:04:18,683
I should probably get back
out to Andie and Daniel.

1349
01:04:18,719 --> 01:04:20,652
They probably
think I've run off.

1350
01:04:20,754 --> 01:04:22,087
Enjoy your evening you two.

1351
01:04:46,179 --> 01:04:47,179
Christmas miracle.

1352
01:04:52,152 --> 01:04:53,152
Hey are you

1353
01:04:56,056 --> 01:04:57,155
hiding back here?

1354
01:04:59,593 --> 01:05:00,593
Yeah.

1355
01:05:02,796 --> 01:05:03,796
Ian we need to talk.

1356
01:05:04,931 --> 01:05:06,731
You made your decision.

1357
01:05:06,833 --> 01:05:08,600
I'm sorry, I can't marry you.

1358
01:05:10,103 --> 01:05:11,536
You deserve to be with somebody

1359
01:05:11,571 --> 01:05:17,375
who is completely, crazy,
madly in love with you.

1360
01:05:18,645 --> 01:05:20,089
Who doesn't have to think twice

1361
01:05:20,113 --> 01:05:21,880
about whether they
want to marry you.

1362
01:05:23,350 --> 01:05:24,482
And I deserve...

1363
01:05:24,518 --> 01:05:26,251
Someone who actually knows you.

1364
01:05:29,055 --> 01:05:30,055
Yeah.

1365
01:05:33,226 --> 01:05:34,659
I just want you to be happy.

1366
01:05:35,929 --> 01:05:38,863
Hey, will you
stay for Christmas?

1367
01:05:38,899 --> 01:05:41,766
If not for me, for Daniel.

1368
01:05:42,869 --> 01:05:48,373
That's nice Em but
I think it's best if I leave.

1369
01:05:56,316 --> 01:05:57,448
I don't regret one second.

1370
01:05:58,919 --> 01:05:59,919
Not one.

1371
01:06:01,655 --> 01:06:02,787
Me neither.

1372
01:06:20,774 --> 01:06:22,207
You alright Em?

1373
01:06:24,978 --> 01:06:26,377
Alright and better.

1374
01:06:28,348 --> 01:06:30,448
Guess who I found a photograph

1375
01:06:30,483 --> 01:06:32,250
of on Mary's wall?

1376
01:06:37,023 --> 01:06:38,023
What's going on?

1377
01:06:39,826 --> 01:06:41,426
They met in college.

1378
01:06:41,461 --> 01:06:44,295
Your mother planned
to leave home for good,

1379
01:06:44,331 --> 01:06:47,432
join Bobby, RJ she called him

1380
01:06:47,534 --> 01:06:50,435
in Chicago after graduation.

1381
01:06:50,470 --> 01:06:52,570
I can't even imagine
mom living anywhere else.

1382
01:06:52,606 --> 01:06:54,172
No.

1383
01:06:54,207 --> 01:06:56,307
Once upon a time she
wanted to be a city girl.

1384
01:06:57,410 --> 01:07:00,044
Then that summer changed
everything though.

1385
01:07:00,146 --> 01:07:03,226
Bobby arrived in Oliver's
Well to find Carol

1386
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:05,717
in love with the town

1387
01:07:05,785 --> 01:07:07,619
and with another man.

1388
01:07:07,654 --> 01:07:09,921
So she left him,

1389
01:07:09,990 --> 01:07:12,268
broke off the engagement
to be with dad?

1390
01:07:12,292 --> 01:07:15,727
She told Bobby right
away, there were no lies.

1391
01:07:15,829 --> 01:07:16,694
No secrets.

1392
01:07:16,796 --> 01:07:18,741
And Bobby stayed?

1393
01:07:18,765 --> 01:07:19,765
Why?

1394
01:07:20,667 --> 01:07:22,767
The magic of Oliver's Well.

1395
01:07:23,770 --> 01:07:26,182
He felt at home here.

1396
01:07:26,206 --> 01:07:27,338
He must've been so angry.

1397
01:07:28,341 --> 01:07:29,908
Hurt.

1398
01:07:29,943 --> 01:07:31,709
At first, certainly.

1399
01:07:32,979 --> 01:07:34,279
But darling,

1400
01:07:34,381 --> 01:07:38,349
it takes guts to leave
someone who is wrong for you.

1401
01:07:38,451 --> 01:07:40,084
To admit you made a mistake.

1402
01:07:41,721 --> 01:07:45,256
And in this tale it was
the absolute best decision.

1403
01:07:46,726 --> 01:07:51,062
Mom allowed not just one
but two love stories to begin.

1404
01:07:51,097 --> 01:07:54,666
She gave me the best
gift I could ever ask for.

1405
01:07:57,037 --> 01:07:58,037
I owe her so much.

1406
01:07:59,539 --> 01:08:01,873
Oh we loved both of them

1407
01:08:01,908 --> 01:08:03,408
more than words can say.

1408
01:08:08,081 --> 01:08:09,647
I gotta tuck the kids into bed.

1409
01:08:11,184 --> 01:08:12,784
Merry Christmas Mrs. Jacobs.

1410
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:15,453
Merry Christmas Daniel.

1411
01:08:23,630 --> 01:08:24,696
Emma.

1412
01:08:27,267 --> 01:08:28,267
Emma.

1413
01:08:30,403 --> 01:08:31,502
Emma wake up.

1414
01:08:33,473 --> 01:08:34,739
It's Christmas.

1415
01:08:37,510 --> 01:08:39,444
Merry Christmas sweetie.

1416
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:48,152
Daniel's up.

1417
01:08:48,188 --> 01:08:49,188
Okay.

1418
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:54,926
We thought we heard something.

1419
01:08:57,397 --> 01:08:59,030
Taking after dad?

1420
01:08:59,099 --> 01:09:01,877
Doing a little last
minute present wrapping?

1421
01:09:01,901 --> 01:09:02,901
Couldn't sleep.

1422
01:09:04,437 --> 01:09:07,238
That was not the Christmas
Eve that I had planned.

1423
01:09:09,609 --> 01:09:11,554
It was a success.

1424
01:09:11,578 --> 01:09:13,990
You and Anne Marie
were a triumph.

1425
01:09:14,014 --> 01:09:15,925
Yet, in the middle of it,

1426
01:09:15,949 --> 01:09:19,183
my sister managed to get
engaged and unengaged.

1427
01:09:20,653 --> 01:09:22,620
Then I find out our parents
fairytale love story

1428
01:09:22,722 --> 01:09:24,355
has a serious twist.

1429
01:09:25,325 --> 01:09:26,824
A secret they kept from me.

1430
01:09:28,595 --> 01:09:29,595
Us.

1431
01:09:31,631 --> 01:09:35,666
I don't think it was
intentional deception.

1432
01:09:36,970 --> 01:09:38,403
Memories get foggy.

1433
01:09:38,438 --> 01:09:39,504
What else don't we know?

1434
01:09:42,008 --> 01:09:43,107
I have so many questions.

1435
01:09:44,210 --> 01:09:45,877
Questions I was too busy to ask.

1436
01:09:48,615 --> 01:09:50,748
There's so much
more I want to say.

1437
01:09:50,850 --> 01:09:51,850
I know.

1438
01:09:53,153 --> 01:09:54,153
Me too.

1439
01:09:56,990 --> 01:09:59,891
I hate that we
can't talk to them.

1440
01:10:02,662 --> 01:10:04,429
I can't believe we lost them.

1441
01:10:06,566 --> 01:10:08,477
We haven't really
lost them you know.

1442
01:10:08,501 --> 01:10:09,967
They are everywhere.

1443
01:10:11,204 --> 01:10:14,338
They are in every
corner of this house.

1444
01:10:14,441 --> 01:10:16,574
They're in the lives
of so many people.

1445
01:10:19,179 --> 01:10:20,179
In us.

1446
01:10:23,349 --> 01:10:24,349
Hey.

1447
01:10:25,618 --> 01:10:28,831
You don't have to hold this
family together you know.

1448
01:10:28,855 --> 01:10:29,954
Not all by yourself.

1449
01:10:32,092 --> 01:10:35,293
We are all here for each other.

1450
01:10:38,765 --> 01:10:40,631
I was just trying
to make her proud.

1451
01:10:42,435 --> 01:10:44,368
Keep Christmas the way
they would of wanted.

1452
01:10:46,473 --> 01:10:48,906
I thought it might keep
it from hurting so much.

1453
01:10:49,876 --> 01:10:52,110
Well you did it.

1454
01:10:52,145 --> 01:10:53,556
You did it.

1455
01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:56,047
This is exactly the Christmas
they would have wanted.

1456
01:10:57,817 --> 01:10:59,550
Full of surprises.

1457
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:04,567
Speaking of surprises,

1458
01:11:04,591 --> 01:11:06,557
I have one more for you both.

1459
01:11:09,095 --> 01:11:10,895
I've decided to buy this house.

1460
01:11:15,235 --> 01:11:16,100
What?

1461
01:11:16,169 --> 01:11:17,169
Yeah.

1462
01:11:17,704 --> 01:11:19,770
I'm moving back here.

1463
01:11:19,806 --> 01:11:21,873
And I'm gonna take
over the firm from Joe.

1464
01:11:22,709 --> 01:11:24,142
Daniel, this is a good thing.

1465
01:11:25,411 --> 01:11:26,244
I didn't know.

1466
01:11:26,279 --> 01:11:27,378
I didn't even think you...

1467
01:11:32,552 --> 01:11:35,086
Emma the Davis' made an
offer yesterday morning

1468
01:11:36,723 --> 01:11:38,156
after they saw the house.

1469
01:11:40,793 --> 01:11:42,560
And I accepted on our behalf.

1470
01:11:52,272 --> 01:11:54,005
Okay.

1471
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:55,506
Hey it's fine, it's no big deal.

1472
01:11:56,943 --> 01:11:58,903
That just means it wasn't
meant to be, that's all.

1473
01:12:20,233 --> 01:12:21,233
Oh no.

1474
01:12:22,769 --> 01:12:24,468
Before breakfast even.

1475
01:12:24,571 --> 01:12:27,004
Hey, I make my own rules.

1476
01:12:30,877 --> 01:12:32,154
Merry Christmas.

1477
01:12:32,178 --> 01:12:34,612
Merry Christmas baby sister.

1478
01:12:35,915 --> 01:12:37,181
I am gonna head back.

1479
01:12:38,952 --> 01:12:40,585
Oliver's Well
will still be here.

1480
01:12:42,322 --> 01:12:43,654
Morgan Shelby might not be.

1481
01:12:45,091 --> 01:12:46,891
Morgan thinks of me as a friend.

1482
01:12:48,494 --> 01:12:50,094
He also thinks you're engaged.

1483
01:12:53,333 --> 01:12:54,310
You guys better get in there.

1484
01:12:54,334 --> 01:12:55,611
The kids are gonna
mutiny if we don't

1485
01:12:55,635 --> 01:12:56,434
start opening presents.

1486
01:12:56,469 --> 01:12:58,502
Hey you two, talk.

1487
01:13:13,052 --> 01:13:14,052
So,

1488
01:13:15,688 --> 01:13:17,922
I'm sorry I didn't tell
you about med school.

1489
01:13:20,693 --> 01:13:22,771
And I'm sorry I made
you feel like I was

1490
01:13:22,795 --> 01:13:24,595
too busy to listen.

1491
01:13:26,332 --> 01:13:29,567
You have everything it takes
to be an excellent doctor.

1492
01:13:30,870 --> 01:13:31,870
You mean that?

1493
01:13:32,972 --> 01:13:33,972
I do.

1494
01:13:37,610 --> 01:13:40,111
I just feel like
I'm disappointing you.

1495
01:13:40,213 --> 01:13:41,213
Rumi,

1496
01:13:42,782 --> 01:13:45,060
do you have any
idea how proud I am

1497
01:13:45,084 --> 01:13:47,518
that even I wasn't
even able to sway you?

1498
01:13:49,455 --> 01:13:51,033
If there's one thing I
learned from my mother

1499
01:13:51,057 --> 01:13:53,469
it's that you have
to let your children

1500
01:13:53,493 --> 01:13:54,959
follow their dreams.

1501
01:13:56,229 --> 01:13:58,329
And trust that they'll
come home to you.

1502
01:14:01,567 --> 01:14:02,678
Grandma had a hard
time with that

1503
01:14:02,702 --> 01:14:04,602
and now, I am too.

1504
01:14:13,246 --> 01:14:15,291
Promise me one thing okay.

1505
01:14:15,315 --> 01:14:16,892
That you will tell
me when you're making

1506
01:14:16,916 --> 01:14:18,683
these big life decisions?

1507
01:14:19,652 --> 01:14:22,420
So I can just pretend
you still need me.

1508
01:14:24,490 --> 01:14:26,435
I don't have to pretend mom.

1509
01:14:26,459 --> 01:14:27,459
I do need you.

1510
01:14:28,261 --> 01:14:29,327
At least...

1511
01:14:36,302 --> 01:14:37,446
A present here for you Emma.

1512
01:14:39,072 --> 01:14:40,072
Wait there's no tag.

1513
01:14:42,442 --> 01:14:43,442
Not from me.

1514
01:14:44,577 --> 01:14:45,577
Or us.

1515
01:14:46,679 --> 01:14:47,956
Don't look at me.

1516
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:48,980
Okay.

1517
01:15:02,862 --> 01:15:05,129
It's just like the one mom had.

1518
01:15:06,032 --> 01:15:07,198
I broke the other one

1519
01:15:09,168 --> 01:15:10,901
years ago by accident.

1520
01:15:12,538 --> 01:15:13,938
When I had that fight with mom.

1521
01:15:27,420 --> 01:15:31,122
"Dear Emma, Merry Christmas."

1522
01:15:32,258 --> 01:15:33,190
This gentleman journeyed

1523
01:15:33,226 --> 01:15:34,825
to my shop two years ago.

1524
01:15:36,129 --> 01:15:38,362
Kept him hidden because I
couldn't bear to sell him.

1525
01:15:39,532 --> 01:15:41,265
I think he'd be better
off with you though.

1526
01:15:42,468 --> 01:15:43,901
I hope he'll bring you joy,

1527
01:15:45,004 --> 01:15:46,248
because I certainly
have found joy

1528
01:15:46,272 --> 01:15:47,905
in your company this Christmas.

1529
01:15:48,741 --> 01:15:49,874
It's from Morgan.

1530
01:15:53,746 --> 01:15:54,746
Emma.

1531
01:15:55,715 --> 01:15:56,715
What was the moral

1532
01:15:57,617 --> 01:15:58,949
of our parents love story?

1533
01:16:02,922 --> 01:16:03,922
To be brave.

1534
01:16:11,097 --> 01:16:12,097
I have to go.

1535
01:16:12,999 --> 01:16:13,999
Go where?

1536
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:15,500
I left things all wrong
with Morgan.

1537
01:16:16,569 --> 01:16:18,502
But I have a turkey cooking.

1538
01:16:18,604 --> 01:16:20,883
But I'm leaving tomorrow.

1539
01:16:20,907 --> 01:16:22,506
It's Christmas Daniel.

1540
01:16:22,542 --> 01:16:24,642
You know anything is
possible at Christmas.

1541
01:16:38,224 --> 01:16:40,691
Emma hi, Merry Christmas.

1542
01:16:40,793 --> 01:16:42,727
Hey, Merry Christmas Maureen.

1543
01:16:44,063 --> 01:16:45,307
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

1544
01:16:45,331 --> 01:16:46,597
May I have a quick word...

1545
01:16:46,633 --> 01:16:48,366
I've got it Maureen.

1546
01:16:50,170 --> 01:16:50,835
Hey.

1547
01:16:50,870 --> 01:16:51,769
Hi.

1548
01:16:51,804 --> 01:16:54,049
I take it you got my gift?

1549
01:16:54,073 --> 01:16:55,473
I did.

1550
01:16:55,508 --> 01:16:58,242
I can't believe
you had him here.

1551
01:16:58,278 --> 01:16:59,278
Thank you so much.

1552
01:17:00,580 --> 01:17:02,780
Did you drive all the way
out just to say thank you?

1553
01:17:02,815 --> 01:17:04,226
You didn't have to do that.

1554
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:05,961
Well I'm leaving first thing
tomorrow morning

1555
01:17:05,985 --> 01:17:07,518
so it's now or never.

1556
01:17:10,590 --> 01:17:12,023
I heard the house sold.

1557
01:17:12,058 --> 01:17:13,435
Maureen knows the
couple who bought it

1558
01:17:13,459 --> 01:17:15,726
so I guess it all
worked out in the end.

1559
01:17:16,729 --> 01:17:18,029
I'm glad.

1560
01:17:18,131 --> 01:17:19,297
I want you to know,

1561
01:17:20,466 --> 01:17:21,677
this Christmas would
have been a lot harder

1562
01:17:21,701 --> 01:17:22,833
for me without you.

1563
01:17:25,438 --> 01:17:28,005
That's what friends are for.

1564
01:17:29,642 --> 01:17:31,275
I don't wanna leave

1565
01:17:31,377 --> 01:17:33,311
without giving you your gift.

1566
01:17:34,314 --> 01:17:35,613
Give it a chance.

1567
01:17:35,648 --> 01:17:37,014
Maybe it'll grow on you.

1568
01:17:38,151 --> 01:17:39,151
Thank you.

1569
01:17:40,753 --> 01:17:41,953
Anyway.

1570
01:17:42,055 --> 01:17:43,020
Emma.

1571
01:17:43,056 --> 01:17:44,056
Yeah.

1572
01:17:45,325 --> 01:17:47,391
Don't stay away so long.

1573
01:17:47,427 --> 01:17:48,427
Next time.

1574
01:17:48,895 --> 01:17:49,827
Okay.

1575
01:17:49,862 --> 01:17:50,862
I won't.

1576
01:17:51,898 --> 01:17:54,165
If you and Maureen end up
coming to New York,

1577
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:57,134
look me up.

1578
01:17:57,237 --> 01:17:58,237
Bye.

1579
01:18:07,981 --> 01:18:09,580
Really? You should
of told her there was

1580
01:18:09,682 --> 01:18:11,148
nothing going on between us.

1581
01:18:11,184 --> 01:18:12,561
I didn't realize
that's what she meant.

1582
01:18:12,585 --> 01:18:14,230
But what's the point?

1583
01:18:14,254 --> 01:18:15,998
She's engaged and she's...

1584
01:18:16,022 --> 01:18:17,755
She wasn't wearing
the ring today.

1585
01:18:17,790 --> 01:18:18,934
You think a woman
like Emma Reynolds

1586
01:18:18,958 --> 01:18:20,002
comes around every Christmas?

1587
01:18:20,026 --> 01:18:21,726
No.

1588
01:18:21,794 --> 01:18:23,072
I think it's been years
since she's been here

1589
01:18:23,096 --> 01:18:24,862
and it's gonna be
even more years before

1590
01:18:24,897 --> 01:18:27,298
she comes back to Oliver's Well.

1591
01:18:27,333 --> 01:18:29,433
She didn't come over
here just to say thank you.

1592
01:18:30,870 --> 01:18:32,147
Now's the part when
you run after her

1593
01:18:32,171 --> 01:18:33,971
and you tell her
that you love her.

1594
01:18:34,007 --> 01:18:35,007
Because you do.

1595
01:18:36,376 --> 01:18:39,610
I know because you've
never bought one before.

1596
01:19:42,542 --> 01:19:43,908
What are you doing here?

1597
01:19:45,078 --> 01:19:47,178
I think I owe you
a hot chocolate.

1598
01:19:52,652 --> 01:19:53,652
Emma.

1599
01:19:53,686 --> 01:19:54,686
Yeah.

1600
01:19:56,089 --> 01:19:57,089
I need to know.

1601
01:19:59,158 --> 01:20:00,758
What happened with Ian?

1602
01:20:01,761 --> 01:20:03,327
Ian left.

1603
01:20:03,363 --> 01:20:04,462
He went home for Christmas.

1604
01:20:06,599 --> 01:20:07,599
Without you?

1605
01:20:09,769 --> 01:20:10,769
I told him no.

1606
01:20:11,904 --> 01:20:13,537
I couldn't marry him.

1607
01:20:13,573 --> 01:20:17,942
I realized that my mother
was really brave about

1608
01:20:20,113 --> 01:20:23,080
speaking the truth
about how she felt

1609
01:20:25,785 --> 01:20:26,984
and what was in her heart.

1610
01:20:28,421 --> 01:20:32,256
And I decided I have
to be the same way.

1611
01:20:33,726 --> 01:20:36,327
So I told him no, we weren't
right for each other.

1612
01:20:37,897 --> 01:20:38,897
But the ring.

1613
01:20:41,134 --> 01:20:42,166
The ring was stuck.

1614
01:20:43,770 --> 01:20:45,180
I couldn't get it off.

1615
01:20:48,141 --> 01:20:49,440
That's terrible.

1616
01:20:49,542 --> 01:20:51,175
I know, you're telling me.

1617
01:20:54,414 --> 01:20:57,481
But you should be home
with Maureen right now.

1618
01:20:58,951 --> 01:21:00,084
Maureen's my cousin.

1619
01:21:02,054 --> 01:21:03,687
You're kidding.

1620
01:21:03,756 --> 01:21:04,733
No.

1621
01:21:04,757 --> 01:21:06,824
I should tell you
when I was buying

1622
01:21:06,859 --> 01:21:08,137
tickets for the ball.

1623
01:21:08,161 --> 01:21:09,794
I was planning on
asking you when we

1624
01:21:09,829 --> 01:21:11,028
were decorating the tree.

1625
01:21:11,063 --> 01:21:12,363
But then when Ian came,

1626
01:21:12,398 --> 01:21:13,697
I just thought...

1627
01:21:18,237 --> 01:21:20,604
Getting to spend part of
your Christmas with you

1628
01:21:21,774 --> 01:21:24,942
has taught me that I've
been playing it safe.

1629
01:21:25,778 --> 01:21:26,710
Sticking to what I know

1630
01:21:26,746 --> 01:21:29,513
instead of being open to...

1631
01:21:31,451 --> 01:21:32,451
To taking chances.

1632
01:21:33,886 --> 01:21:35,619
I've learned that
I don't care if I

1633
01:21:35,655 --> 01:21:36,932
have to drive six
hours to see you.

1634
01:21:36,956 --> 01:21:38,422
I don't care what I have to do

1635
01:21:38,524 --> 01:21:41,425
as long as I get to see
you at the end of it.

1636
01:21:42,462 --> 01:21:43,672
And I've learned that
I never should of

1637
01:21:43,696 --> 01:21:44,862
let you off my front step

1638
01:21:44,897 --> 01:21:46,141
and I'm not gonna
let you go now.

1639
01:21:46,165 --> 01:21:47,165
Emma.

1640
01:21:49,402 --> 01:21:50,402
I am

1641
01:21:52,138 --> 01:21:53,549
gratefully, happily,

1642
01:21:53,573 --> 01:21:55,039
and deeply in love with you.

1643
01:21:56,042 --> 01:21:58,075
I'm in love with you too.

1644
01:22:30,910 --> 01:22:32,187
Merry Christmas!

1645
01:22:32,211 --> 01:22:33,211
Hey Joe!

1646
01:22:35,815 --> 01:22:38,215
Hey, I come bearing
tidings of great joy.

1647
01:22:38,251 --> 01:22:39,483
What is this?

1648
01:22:39,519 --> 01:22:41,585
A little present
from your brother.

1649
01:22:43,055 --> 01:22:46,090
This is paperwork for the sale

1650
01:22:46,125 --> 01:22:47,591
of Honeysuckle house.

1651
01:22:47,693 --> 01:22:49,326
But Daniel...

1652
01:22:49,362 --> 01:22:52,229
I called the Davis',
told them everything,

1653
01:22:52,265 --> 01:22:56,267
and they released us
from the contract.

1654
01:22:56,302 --> 01:22:59,003
They totally understood
the change of heart.

1655
01:22:59,038 --> 01:23:00,649
The house is yours Emma.

1656
01:23:00,673 --> 01:23:02,918
Provided your siblings agree.

1657
01:23:02,942 --> 01:23:04,742
Of course, it's wonderful.

1658
01:23:05,511 --> 01:23:06,511
What?

1659
01:23:06,612 --> 01:23:07,612
Oh Joe!

1660
01:23:09,849 --> 01:23:11,448
Well in that case,

1661
01:23:11,484 --> 01:23:14,718
is the offer to take over
for you still on the table?

1662
01:23:14,754 --> 01:23:17,288
I thought you'd never ask.

1663
01:23:17,323 --> 01:23:18,734
I'll write up your
resignation letter

1664
01:23:18,758 --> 01:23:20,391
to Huntley and Morrison myself.

1665
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:22,493
Welcome home Emma.

1666
01:23:25,698 --> 01:23:30,534
Everybody, here's to
another wonderful Christmas

1667
01:23:31,170 --> 01:23:33,148
on Honeysuckle Lane.

1668
01:23:33,172 --> 01:23:34,172
May there be many more.

1669
01:23:35,741 --> 01:23:37,675
This one's gonna be
pretty hard to top.

1670
01:23:38,945 --> 01:23:40,722
I'll try my best.

1671
01:23:43,182 --> 01:23:43,981
I hope you're hungry.

1672
01:23:44,016 --> 01:23:46,250
Oh yeah, of course.

1673
01:23:51,251 --> 01:23:55,250
