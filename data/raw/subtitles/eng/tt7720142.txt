1
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,680
Papa!

2
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,200
My kiss.

3
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,280
I told you to go straight from school,
not all the way home.

4
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,440
The roads are dangerous.

5
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,280
-But I...
-Forget your dress, yes.

6
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,320
Come.

7
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,680
Mom's wedding ring.

8
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,480
The only other woman who's ever
accompanied me was your mother.

9
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,840
You're old enough.

10
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,160
I thought you should
wear something of hers.

11
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,840
Your uncle is downstairs.

12
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,400
Wear your dress.

13
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,960
Oh, my God.

14
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,440
No!

15
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,120
Run!

16
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,880
Jonna!

17
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,160
Jonn

18
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,600
Jo

19
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,960
Go! Go! Find my brother!

20
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,680
Jonna!

21
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,800
This is Luka Lesek.

22
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,960
He runs the largest human trafficking
operation in all of Eastern Europe.

23
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,720
It's women and children mostly.

24
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,640
Used for forced labor,
prostitution, and so on.

25
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,480
And he runs the local police,
of course, with kickbacks.

26
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,160
And did I tell you,

27
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,440
just around the corner
from where you are now,

28
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,160
the most marvelous bar...

29
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,360
I don't know what it's like now,
but in the '90s,

30
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,760
the most beautiful women
in all of Eastern Europe.

31
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,160
You love the sound of your own voice,
don't you, old man?

32
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,880
Morgan, dear boy, I'm just trying to help.

33
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,480
You know,
there's more to life than just...

34
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,080
You know, I'd love to take the travel tips
from an aging Lothario like yourself,

35
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,720
but now really is not the time.

36
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,480
All right, well, I'll leave you to it.

37
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,600
And do me a favor.

38
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,240
Try not to reduce the splendid city
of Ljubljana to rubble.

39
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,200
I can't make any promises.

40
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,240
Travel safe.

41
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,760
"Nor dread nor hope attend a dying animal

42
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,120
"A man awaits his end

43
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,160
"Dreading and hoping all."

44
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,680
Fuck!

45
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,920
Where are you, bastard?

46
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,040
Fuck.

47
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,080
Come on.

48
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,800
God!

49
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,480
I'm glad I got you, Morgan.
Tell me all about it.

50
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,240
Well, to say it didn't go well
would be a slight understatement.

51
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,920
I'm sorry to hear that. Care to explain?

52
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,160
Digging a bullet out of my body, but...

53
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,800
Somebody shot me as I targeted Lesek.

54
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,240
You know, a little flesh wound
here and there,

55
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,040
that's pretty much
part of the job description.

56
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,000
It felt calculated. Professional.

57
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,680
I think there was a third party involved.

58
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,160
Another shooter?

59
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,920
Well, thank God you're alive.
What about Lesek?

60
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,200
The guy who shot me shot him.

61
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,120
Clearly not too selective.

62
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,440
Right. Well, I'll dig around,
and see what I can find out.

63
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,800
Another thing.

64
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,720
There's a new job, came in after you left.

65
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,320
I think it's about time that we let
some young guns take over, buddy.

66
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,440
People who don't mind getting shot.

67
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,480
No, no, no, no.

68
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,520
Morgan, this isn't something
we just pass up.

69
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,840
This is big.

70
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,360
So travel safe.

71
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,360
We'll talk about it
when you get back, all right?

72
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,120
My day just got better.

73
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,160
Are you hurt?

74
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,160
Oh, no.

75
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,360
Just tired. Really long day.

76
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,040
I can hear it. Video, please.

77
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,360
The signal's not that great, babe.

78
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,640
I don't think I'm gonna get picture up.

79
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,880
Come on. I miss seeing you.

80
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,680
I don't sleep well when you're not here,
and you know that.

81
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,440
I think you tie that robe too tight.

82
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,560
Do I?

83
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,000
So maybe I should loosen it?

84
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,040
That does feel better.

85
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,720
Sorry. Connection's bad.

86
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,800
That's just cruel.

87
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,400
Look, I got to... I gotta go.

88
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,200
You got a plane to catch?

89
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,000
Good. Love you.

90
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,040
I miss you.

91
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,440
Oh, God.

92
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,600
The attack culminated
in the demise of Luca Lesek,

93
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,040
leader of the Ljubljana crime ring.

94
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,960
A rival syndicate? Perhaps.
A personal feud? It's possible.

95
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,600
But if you look at the autopsy reports,
it will indicate otherwise.

96
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,080
Clearly this was done by a trained hand.

97
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,080
If we look at the wounds here,
they're way too precise

98
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,720
for what we expect
from a typical gang war.

99
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,600
The bullet's entry
and its pinpoint accuracy

100
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,560
would suggest an assassination.

101
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,440
Personal belief, a contract killer
with a military background.

102
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,040
Our best option at the moment
is to work with the local authorities.

103
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,160
So, ladies and gentlemen,
let's get to work.

104
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,360
We got a lot to do.

105
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,960
Thank you.

106
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,040
What's been happening in the world today?

107
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,520
What are you up to?
To no good?

108
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,880
Graffiti. Okay.

109
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,120
Well, you gotta practice more, buddy.

110
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,720
How about you?

111
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,560
Come on. I know you're a good person.

112
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,520
Buy him some water or something.

113
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,320
There we go.

114
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,800
There are still
some good people in this world.

115
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,960
There she is.

116
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,000
I missed you.

117
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,120
It's so good to see you.

118
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,880
Got you something.

119
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,840
This one looks like it's had a rough life.

120
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,480
Like you wouldn't believe.

121
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,760
One of these days you're gonna let me
get you something nice.

122
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,440
I prefer this.

123
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,120
-Let's go home.
-I'll get you more of them.

124
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,280
You're a sight for sore eyes.

125
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,560
It's so good to have you back.

126
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,960
-Hi.
-Hi.

127
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,720
-What's this?
-It's nothing.

128
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,360
It's just a scratch.
You know how clumsy I am.

129
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,840
What the fuck, Morgan?

130
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,240
What's this?

131
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,960
I didn't want to tell you,
but I know how much you hate motorcycles.

132
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,680
One of the guys had one.

133
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,080
Next thing I know,
I'm upside down in a ditch.

134
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,360
I'm sorry. But it's nothing.

135
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,680
-It's fine.
-It's not fine.

136
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,280
Every time you go away,
bruises, cuts, scratches...

137
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,560
Now this?

138
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,800
-I'm here now, aren't I?
-And what about tomorrow?

139
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,280
Tomorrow I'm gonna be here, too.

140
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,160
And the next day and the next day
and the day after that.

141
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,880
You can't get rid of me that easy.

142
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,880
Promise.

143
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,200
If you can keep me down,
sure, I'll promise.

144
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,560
-I will.
-Yeah?

145
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,200
Shit!

146
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,160
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

147
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,160
Just double broken ribs, but okay.

148
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,200
The instructions were very clear.

149
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,240
Yeah, and I told you I'm out.

150
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:13,120
Morgan, it was a close thing.
I understand.

151
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,080
And you faced your own mortality. Yes.

152
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,120
But look, it was an off day.
We all have off days.

153
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,240
Gyoza? They're very good.

154
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,280
I don't think you're listening to me.
I'm out.

155
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,520
I'm out, too.

156
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,320
Of soy sauce.

157
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,080
Waiter!

158
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,120
-You're insufferable.
-Morgan, sit down. Come on.

159
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,440
Don't be so dramatic. Come on.

160
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,120
It's not that simple.

161
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,040
The client specifically requested you.

162
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,920
Why?

163
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,600
Because of your boyish good looks,
your devilish charm. Who knows?

164
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,200
Or maybe they're just fans of your work.
It doesn't matter.

165
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,200
The thing is, it's not one job.

166
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,960
It's six. Six separate contracts.

167
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,080
And each one pays a million dollars.

168
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,360
Now, that money would set you up for life.

169
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,640
-What kind of life would that be?
-Whatever you want it to be.

170
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,000
It's $6 million.

171
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,160
I don't know if you're familiar
with that sort of concept,

172
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:18,520
but that can buy you
an awful lot of bottles of Pinot Noir.

173
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,880
We're doing good work.

174
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,600
-Good?
-Necessary work.

175
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,080
These are evil men.

176
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,200
Now, I know they're supposed to pay
for their sins in the next life.

177
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,680
But why wait for that?

178
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,920
I don't know. This last job...

179
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,600
I know, but you survived.

180
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,000
-And you know why?
-'Cause that's what you trained me to do.

181
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,120
This is what you're meant to do.

182
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,200
Now, these six contracts...

183
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,080
Remember when
we first started working together?

184
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,800
I was just a kid.

185
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,600
I had no plan, no connections, no clue.

186
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,520
Now I've had my time. Okay.

187
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,960
There comes a point when
you need to understand when to quit.

188
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,840
When you're still able to wake up
in the morning and enjoy a sunrise.

189
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,680
I fucking love my sunrises, Caldwell.
I really do.

190
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,080
So if you want that money bad enough,

191
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,160
you're gonna have to squeeze
those triggers yourself.

192
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,720
What's this about, Morgan?

193
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,160
There's three reasons
why people like us stop.

194
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,640
The first one is we find God.

195
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,040
Now, in your case,
I think that's extremely unlikely.

196
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:26,760
The second one is,
and I do hope it's not this, a woman.

197
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,400
Now, that's never a good enough reason.

198
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,360
Trust me, I know.

199
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,880
-And the third one...
-We're dead.

200
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,160
Yes, we die.

201
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,400
But not you, Morgan.

202
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,040
No, not you.

203
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,680
Now...

204
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,160
Gyoza?

205
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,400
Come on. They're really very good.

206
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,440
I fucking hate you sometimes.
You know that?

207
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,840
Oh, my God. The amount of things
they put in mayonnaise.

208
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,760
Hey, grab that pasta. It's my favorite.

209
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,560
This is my corner right here.

210
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,040
My favorite cereal.

211
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,000
It's got a secret decoder ring inside.

212
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,280
There is no prize. Come on.

213
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,600
Well, they wouldn't put it
on the front of the box.

214
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,320
I mean, that defeats the object
of it being a secret.

215
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,960
Besides, I'm gonna use it
to figure things out.

216
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,880
Like why you deserve me?

217
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,680
Well, I know the answer to that already.
That's easy.

218
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,120
I don't.

219
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,920
-For the kids.
-Too much sugar.

220
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,920
-Maybe something else.
-Keep them for myself then.

221
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,040
It's fate.

222
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,440
-Our first pet.
-It's a plant.

223
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,720
Well, yeah, but you still gotta
feed it and things, right?

224
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,800
-Water it.
-Take it out.

225
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,920
-Like for walks and things?
-Sure. Why not?

226
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,720
Your responsibility.

227
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,360
Think it will be us one day?

228
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,520
I bet they're out here every single night.

229
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,040
Watch.

230
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,200
He's gonna take his jacket off
and put it around her shoulders.

231
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,440
And then she's gonna grab his hand again.

232
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,800
Wow. Four years, and I still don't know
how you do that.

233
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,880
You just have to predict.
All the threads are there.

234
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,560
You just piece them together
and figure it out, I guess.

235
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,280
What do you think about that couple?

236
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,880
I think he looks more interested
in the girl with the white boots than her.

237
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,040
Yeah. And she knows it.

238
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,840
But she won't say she's upset.

239
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,160
Well, her body language will give it away.

240
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,640
She's either gonna look away
or fold her arms.

241
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,120
So you always know what I'm gonna do next?

242
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,800
No.

243
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,240
You should come home with me.

244
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,480
My parents are tired
of only hearing stories about you.

245
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:36,040
Handsome, smart, kind photojournalist.

246
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,440
They think I made you up.

247
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,680
It does sound like you did make me up.

248
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,920
What do you think
about this guy on our left?

249
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,840
He's wondering why
you're avoiding the subject.

250
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,120
Okay, I'll come home with you.

251
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,080
Aren't you full of surprises these days?

252
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,640
And you know what?
You're not the only one.

253
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,920
-So you have some surprises, too.
-Maybe.

254
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,200
And before you ask,
it's not about my art program.

255
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,080
Somebody help me!

256
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,760
What are you doing?

257
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,160
You're photographing him?

258
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,720
It's all right. It's over.
You're safe. Okay?

259
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,400
We need to call the police.

260
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,960
-We can't just...
-We gotta go, Sophie.

261
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,480
You just killed a man.

262
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,480
Left his body in the park.

263
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,320
We need to call the police.

264
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,080
It was self-defense. I'll tell them you...

265
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,200
Don't touch me.

266
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,800
The things you did to him.

267
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,600
How were you able to?
You searched his body for what?

268
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,640
For an ID.

269
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,560
For foreign currency. Some sort of lead.

270
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,520
You know, I need to find out who he was.

271
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,840
Was he after you?

272
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,320
So this wasn't any kind of robbery or...

273
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,120
Morgan, answer me.

274
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,760
I don't have the answers.

275
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,360
All I know is that
you are not safe with me.

276
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,880
I just need time.

277
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,400
Give me time.

278
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,520
Show me the contracts.

279
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,160
I want to see
the goddamn contracts, Caldwell.

280
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,400
Show me the fucking files
or you're going to be the job!

281
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:59,080
This is the second time this week
that there's been a targeted hit on me.

282
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,280
I want to know why.

283
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,880
The timing of those contracts
isn't a fucking coincidence!

284
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,880
Well, I'll do some digging around.
See what I can find out.

285
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,600
Who are they?

286
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,520
-Oh, Christ. Don't you ever knock?
-Who are they?

287
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,480
You know, there are certain civilities
when you enter a chap's place, you know?

288
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,760
The man who tried to kill me.

289
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,680
Well, composition's nice.

290
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,040
Subject matter's a touch macabre.

291
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,440
Find out who he is and who sent him.

292
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,560
I can tell you who he is.

293
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,480
His name's Alec Drakos.

294
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,080
Greek national, special ops,
couple of tours of Afghanistan,

295
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,920
became a mercenary,
ultimately a gun for hire.

296
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,000
And I bet he's the chap
that shot you in Slovenia.

297
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,680
Look at this. Better days.

298
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,120
Now, on the plus side,

299
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,240
a million dollars
will be wired to your account.

300
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,880
Plus my usual fee.

301
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,760
And I will take care
of the finger business.

302
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,200
Mr. Rossi, who has a liberal view
when it comes to bribery.

303
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:25,160
Caldwell, what the fuck
are you talking about?

304
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,960
Right. I forgot to tell you.

305
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,640
Each kill must be confirmed
by the receipt of a finger

306
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,440
to a postal box in Paris.

307
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,280
So, listen to me.

308
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,040
You are in now.

309
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,200
I have accepted the job.

310
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,360
I didn't accept anything.

311
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,720
Drakos was one of your contracts.

312
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,400
Good result. Only five to go.

313
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,040
Humor me. Who are the others?

314
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,800
Who are the others?

315
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,800
You know, the worst of the worst.

316
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,880
Backgrounds in espionage
in the military, and crime, of course.

317
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,000
What's the thread?

318
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,800
-What do they have in common?
-Which is?

319
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,360
Their occupation.

320
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,480
They are assassins, Morgan, like you.

321
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,480
Just let me get this right.

322
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,440
I've been hired to assassinate assassins.

323
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,040
And they've been hired to kill me.

324
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,160
And each other.

325
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,080
Fact is, Morgan, they were coming for you,

326
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,240
whether you accepted or not.

327
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,760
But, on the plus side,
same odds, even playing field.

328
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,880
-This isn't a fucking game!
-Yes, it is.

329
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,120
To the person who set this up,
this is a game.

330
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,680
And if you want to live, you have to play.

331
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,520
Here.

332
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:47,360
Morgan, you've got this.

333
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,280
Anselm Ryder.

334
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,280
No! No!

335
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,960
A ruthless psychopath.

336
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,680
Signature move,
collect a finger from the victim.

337
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,160
A souvenir of sorts.

338
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,440
Pablo Martinez.

339
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,920
Mr. Martinez is a poisoner.

340
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,440
Yuko.

341
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,880
Yuko is deadly with blades,

342
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,400
and in close combat.

343
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,840
The charming Demir
is an opportunistic sociopath.

344
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,040
He's locked up in a maximum security
prison in Bosnia.

345
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,120
Finding him is simple,
but access will be tricky.

346
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,720
Falk.

347
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,720
Now, Falk is a legend and problematic.

348
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,120
No positive IDs, no photos, no patterns.

349
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,520
Just a trail of bodies and cover ups

350
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,360
that are only possible
if Falk's working...

351
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,240
...from within the intelligence community.

352
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,920
Now, each kill must be confirmed
by the receipt of a finger

353
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,840
to a postal box in Paris.

354
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,800
-Demir.
-Who are you?

355
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,880
What do you want?

356
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,160
Good news.

357
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,760
You're being released today.

358
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,600
Pierre, I have a gift for you.

359
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,440
Thanks, Inspector Leon.

360
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,800
Welcome, Inspector Leon.

361
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,320
Taking precautions, I see.

362
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,840
Aren't you?

363
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,320
Maat. The Egyptian goddess...

364
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,400
Of justice.

365
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,280
My reminder to stay focused.

366
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,160
A penthouse in an empty building in Paris.

367
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,920
-How did you manage...
-I bought the building.

368
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,240
Drink?

369
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,720
And when we say drink, we mean vodka.

370
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,560
I'm on duty.

371
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,920
Don't trust a man
who won't drink with you.

372
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,720
That's what my uncle Mariusz says.

373
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,560
But consider the source.

374
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,760
One assassin's been killed.

375
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,520
Alec Drakos.

376
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,560
The responding officer's bodycam.

377
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,400
How did you get this?

378
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,840
I hacked the video server
of the Rome police.

379
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,960
Who killed him?

380
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,760
We don't know.

381
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,720
-What about the others?
-Still searching.

382
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,840
These are very skilled people.

383
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:32,200
Aliases, no digital traces.
They avoid all patterns.

384
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,480
I handed you detailed files
on all of them, didn't I?

385
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,600
So stop telling me things I know,

386
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,000
and start telling me things I don't.

387
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,560
Six million dollars.

388
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,080
Your boss said that would lure them out.

389
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,640
-Now where are they?
-Her plan takes time.

390
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,000
And you're not the only one
who needs to protect his back.

391
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,840
-One mistake...
-Then don't make any.

392
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,040
Wake up.

393
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,960
Where am I?

394
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,520
You received a package.

395
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,440
Box number 115. What do you know about it?

396
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,000
Who the fuck are you?

397
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,000
We're gonna play a very short game.

398
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,360
You don't answer my questions,
or you tell me some lies,

399
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,000
I'll blow your damn brains out.

400
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,320
Who are you and who do you work for?

401
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,560
-Answer me!
-My name is Leon.

402
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,120
Inspector, French police.

403
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,520
A finger arrives along with
the name of the person it was attached to.

404
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,600
We publish a fake obituary in Le Monde

405
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,160
just to confirm receipt.

406
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,800
Within a few days,

407
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:26,840
we receive a file detailing every single
assassination this person committed,

408
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,080
and then
we open investigations into them.

409
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,000
How were you first contacted?

410
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,680
Email, anonymous, untraceable.

411
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,720
We simply followed the directions

412
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:41,520
and posted the first fake obituary

413
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,160
just to say yes.

414
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,120
-Under what name?
-Maat.

415
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,960
Maat? What is that?

416
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:02,520
Maat. We found it was
an Egyptian goddess of truth and justice.

417
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:06,960
She set the order of the universe right
after the chaos of its creation.

418
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,920
-And?
-And she weighs the hearts of the dead

419
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,560
just to see if they're too heavy with evil
to reach paradise.

420
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,480
What significance is that to you?

421
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,040
I believe the message in the name
is perhaps for you,

422
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,960
no?

423
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,680
Morgan Gaines.

424
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:13,400
We're alive, but not quite living.

425
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,560
Dead,

426
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,800
but not yet in the grave.

427
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,920
Stuck in this half-life, until it ends.

428
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,040
When is that?

429
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:30,320
Do you really think
the last surviving assassin will just be

430
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,240
free to enjoy his newfound riches?

431
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:38,680
No, he'll be hunted down, too.

432
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,120
Unless...

433
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,840
Unless we help each other
find the person who's holding our strings.

434
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,120
The puppet master
we're all dancing to now, and,

435
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,040
and,

436
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,800
kill him.

437
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:00,320
Performance wasn't bad.
How long did you practice that for?

438
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,960
He speaks.

439
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,560
Mr. Gaines.

440
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,720
It's in our mutual interest
to communicate.

441
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,600
Collaborate.

442
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,600
We should share what we know.

443
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,520
Why don't you share first?

444
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,880
I'm happy to.

445
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,040
Just give me an address
and a time you'll be there,

446
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,360
and I'll tell you in person.

447
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,000
We can share electronically.

448
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,400
Okey-dokey, sweetie.

449
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,840
But you're taking all the fun out of it.

450
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,960
He bled out like a pig.

451
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,240
Sure smelled like one, too.

452
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,440
So how about you send me
a photo of yourself now?

453
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,120
No.

454
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,560
But I'm sure
you smell better than poor Demir.

455
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,680
Not gonna let you bleed out.

456
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,280
I wanna see you try.

457
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,600
We'll see out of the both of us
who bleeds out first.

458
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:09,400
"Great man and his pride
confronting murderous men."

459
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,200
A great man.

460
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,000
As military snipers,

461
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,400
we were taught when we lock onto a target,

462
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,240
to whisper to ourselves,

463
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,440
steady our breathing,

464
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,240
release all consequence,

465
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,560
and then squeeze the trigger.

466
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,600
I used to recite this poem Death
by William Butler Yeats.

467
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,240
Catchy title.

468
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,760
I think we're being told something here.

469
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,360
The money was most likely
put up by a client

470
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,120
who had hired all of us in the past.

471
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,520
We're from different countries.

472
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,080
Our hits spread all over the world.

473
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,120
Exactly.

474
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,200
We took out our marks
using different methods.

475
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,520
I mean, nothing would point to one person
doing all of these hits.

476
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,320
Now he wants to silence us.

477
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:02,240
Maybe. But why not just hire
one of us to kill us all?

478
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,720
Why now?

479
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,600
Why go after assassins that aren't active?

480
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,360
Demir.

481
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,000
He'd been in prison
for the last four years.

482
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,240
I think they're trying to make a point.

483
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,000
We're meant to feel
the consequences of what we've done.

484
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,120
What it's like to be targeted.

485
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,840
Here's my number.

486
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,520
It's a secure line.

487
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,800
We make a great team.

488
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,960
In fact, here's a little
parting gift for you.

489
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,720
It's Pablo Martinez's location.

490
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,480
Bye, Morgan.

491
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,960
I can tell you who he is.

492
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,400
His name's Alec Drakos.

493
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,520
Special ops, couple tours of Afghanistan,
Greek national.

494
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,560
They are assassins, Morgan, like you.

495
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,080
Christ! Not again.

496
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,880
What would be so terribly wrong
with ringing the buzzer?

497
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,240
When I was targeting Lesek in Slovenia,

498
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,840
you knew those six contracts
were already running, didn't you?

499
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,760
My computer was hacked. Was that you?

500
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,640
Your phone records show that you called

501
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,920
Alec Drakos in Slovenia
after you spoke to me.

502
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,080
Again in Turino.

503
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,680
You lied about his profile.

504
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,720
He was ex-Royal Marines, like me.

505
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,840
Sniper recon division, just like me.

506
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:56,600
No friends, no family,
grew up in foster care.

507
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,280
Like me.

508
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,760
You lied about everything.

509
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,200
I think you've got this terribly wrong.

510
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,360
You were his handler, too.

511
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,240
You fed him his intel.

512
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,760
You told him he could
pick up the Lesek contract

513
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,320
if he got rid of me first, didn't you?

514
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:18,720
Morgan, this only works
if we completely...

515
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,920
You told him my location.

516
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,160
You sent him to fucking kill me!

517
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,000
Bullet came this close to my head!

518
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,960
This close to Sophie's head.

519
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,480
Bring back memories?

520
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:37,920
"Better days," as you put it?

521
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,680
Morgan, calm down.

522
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,200
Okay, Drakos worked for me as well.

523
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:52,440
But it was the game
that set you up against each other.

524
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:53,840
There was no other way.

525
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,720
And choosing between you,
it's like choosing between your children.

526
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,920
But you did choose.

527
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:01,840
And you chose him.

528
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:04,480
No, listen to me. Listen to me.

529
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,360
Of course I set this up between you.
I had to. There was no choice.

530
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:11,280
But I did so
in the full and certain knowledge

531
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,640
that you would win.

532
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,600
You were never going to lose to Drakos.

533
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,720
You're the best, Morgan.
You're the gold standard.

534
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,080
Bullshit.

535
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,520
Was it always about the money for you?

536
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,720
Did any of my kills actually deserve it?

537
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,720
All of them. Each one.

538
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,760
Once you see the lies,
you see the liar, too.

539
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,720
The number to my burner phone
that only you knew

540
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,520
was compromised by Falk.

541
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,680
-I gave her nothing.
-Her?

542
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,920
So you're saying
you actually know this woman.

543
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,680
Your arrogance made you careless,
you traitor.

544
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,240
She knows who you are.

545
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,640
She broke into your records just as I did.

546
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,080
Up until now,

547
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:02,040
it's just been the means
to get close to me.

548
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,640
But once she runs out of her patience,
she's gonna come looking for you,

549
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,520
and have much more of a hands-on approach.

550
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:15,040
You're gonna wish
I put a fucking bullet in your head.

551
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:17,960
Morgan, I'm sorry.

552
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,680
Listen, you can do this.

553
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,480
We can do this.
We've been through so much together.

554
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,520
You were like a father to me.

555
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:35,920
I taught you everything I know.

556
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,440
There's nothing fucking left.

557
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,960
Welcome to the game.

558
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,640
Mr. Gaines.

559
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:26,960
Tell me about your end,
$6 million for the contracts.

560
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:38,280
Their money is in an offshore account
that traces to Kyiv, Ukraine.

561
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:42,600
Now, if look at all our hits tied to Kyiv,
you will find a common theme.

562
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,560
They are all linked to gas pipelines.

563
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,960
Which is a billion-dollar industry.

564
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,200
Mariusz Ilych.

565
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:55,960
His company has been awarded every major
construction project for the past decade,

566
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,360
because we got rid
of anyone standing in his way.

567
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,640
Including his own brother, Yakov.

568
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,880
Now he considers us loose ends.

569
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:07,720
Maybe his niece Jonna
discovered what her uncle did.

570
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:13,240
Now, if she traced her uncle's payments
to all of us...

571
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,600
But didn't know which assassin
killed her daddy,

572
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,400
she could have set us up
against each other.

573
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,480
Pablo Martinez, a bit of an anomaly.

574
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:15,880
Never uses a gun, prefers poison.

575
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,320
"Nor dread nor hope attend
a dying animal..."

576
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,880
No kills for 10 years.
Disappeared after that.

577
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,240
Been off the grid ever since.

578
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:30,720
"A man awaits his end

579
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,080
"Dreading and hoping all..."

580
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:36,680
He's a lone wolf. No wife.

581
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:39,080
-"Many times he died..."
-No kids.

582
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:40,760
"Many times he rose again..."

583
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:44,960
Oh, my God! Yes!

584
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:46,280
Give me a kiss.

585
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:49,400
Okay. Now you can come with me. But, I...

586
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:52,280
Fuck.

587
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:09,040
Drop the ax.

588
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,400
Drop the fucking ax! Turn around.

589
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:13,720
Slowly.

590
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:16,960
Easy.

591
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,560
That girl in there. Is that your daughter?

592
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:24,640
-Where's the mother?
-Breast cancer. Two years ago.

593
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:27,120
Just the two of you here, alone?

594
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,320
Take anything.

595
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,600
Do whatever you want to me.

596
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:35,520
But my daughter, she's only four. Please.

597
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:37,960
Were you offered contracts recently?

598
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,760
Answer the fucking question.

599
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,160
I don't know what it is. I don't know.

600
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:47,960
Tell me what date it is today.

601
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:52,000
Today? May... 5th.

602
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,520
You kill people for a living.

603
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:57,240
I know exactly who you are.
So you don't fucking lie to me.

604
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,480
Otherwise May 5th is gonna
go down in your daughter's memory

605
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:01,720
as the last day she saw her daddy alive.

606
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,600
I killed one person.

607
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,600
Eight years ago.

608
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:10,360
And the nightmares only left me
after my daughter was born.

609
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:13,120
What about that job? Tell me about it.

610
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,720
Daddy, you said 10 minutes for ice cream.

611
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,080
Yes, honey. Daddy's coming.

612
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:22,760
Please.

613
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:38,920
-Wanna color?
-I'm fine.

614
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,160
Maybe next picture. I do a lot.

615
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,240
You do.

616
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,520
Whichever cup you want.

617
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:53,480
Tell me about the last job of yours.
Where was it?

618
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,280
In Prague.

619
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,400
I botched it.

620
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:05,280
Slipped thallium sulfate in his coffee.

621
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:10,040
But the dosage was too weak.

622
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,280
Hospital for 18 days.

623
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,200
His hair fell out.

624
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,040
He lost almost 100 pounds,

625
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,000
and he got a hole in his throat
to help him breathe.

626
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:27,600
I went to the hospital.

627
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,320
Sat in the chapel.

628
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:32,160
I'm not sure
if I was praying for him or myself.

629
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,800
After that, I disappeared.

630
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:37,800
I was done.

631
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,040
Daddy, why are you sad?

632
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,120
No, honey.

633
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,600
Dad is just telling a sad story.

634
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:50,200
Okay?

635
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:53,000
You just give me as many details
as you remember.

636
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:57,440
Somebody's pit us against each other.
I want to find out why and who.

637
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:01,000
He must know
you'll come for him in the end.

638
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,280
Yeah, you can bet on that.

639
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:11,920
Do you mind?

640
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,360
Blue's my favorite color,
but it's okay if you use it.

641
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,040
Thank you.

642
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:20,360
It's my favorite color, too.

643
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:22,880
Honey, do you want more milk?

644
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,520
-Can I have more milk, please?
-Yes.

645
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,800
You need to stay away from the windows.

646
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,480
You might not
have received those contracts,

647
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,520
but there's still
a million-dollar bounty on your head.

648
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:46,880
Do you have a gun?

649
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:48,720
I've got a home phone.

650
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:52,040
Less than 10 people have the number.

651
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,600
And they all live within 20 miles.

652
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,360
I don't use my real name.

653
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,320
I've gone as far from my past as I can.

654
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:12,440
Well, your past has caught up with you.

655
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:14,720
They're coming.

656
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:20,680
Yuko.

657
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:26,960
Yuko is a martial arts master
most feared for her blade work,

658
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:31,040
and she has
perhaps some lingering daddy issues.

659
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:44,040
Now, if her mark is a woman,
she makes a clean strike to her heart.

660
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:47,360
But, if it's a man,
she prefers to cut him open.

661
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,200
Evisceration.

662
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:05,200
Her only weakness,
she dresses very light, no armor.

663
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:08,960
So, if you can manage it,

664
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,480
a single bullet to the chest
ought to put her to rest.

665
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:11,760
Are you okay?

666
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,280
What took you so long?

667
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:49,120
Thank you.

668
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:54,840
It's for your own good.

669
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:01,280
Daddy, Daddy, what's happening?

670
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:02,680
Come here. Come here. Come here.

671
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:06,680
One bullet, my ass.

672
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:14,240
Don't worry.

673
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:23,680
Oh, shit.

674
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:27,640
Death has come to call.

675
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:29,880
I'm afraid so.

676
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:33,880
It's been a long time
since I heard your voice, Falk.

677
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:36,760
-Or should I call you Vicky?
-Don't call me that.

678
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:48,120
Will my death be painful?

679
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,760
It's a warm feeling, like a soft blanket.

680
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:55,040
Just let it pass over and you'll sleep.

681
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:56,520
How very kind.

682
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:58,800
How long do I have?

683
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,480
About an hour.

684
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:03,840
The fact that I'm not already dead

685
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:07,320
leads me to believe
that you need something else from me.

686
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:08,360
What is it?

687
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:14,280
Morgan Gaines. I want his file and mine.

688
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:17,080
You already have his file.
You hacked my computer.

689
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:19,760
Well, I have the official file.

690
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:23,800
I want the personal.
The one that you keep.

691
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,800
-Vicky...
-Don't call me that.

692
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:30,600
You seem to forget I'm dying.
Why should I give you anything?

693
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,080
Because of this.

694
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:35,560
The antidote.

695
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:37,920
I don't believe that for a second.

696
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:41,120
Believe it or not, I don't care.

697
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:43,200
But if you want to live...

698
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,480
All right, well, let me think about this.

699
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:53,840
Meantime, I think
I'll fix myself a drink and...

700
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:57,600
Perhaps you'd like to join me.
We could have a good chat.

701
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,120
Please sit.

702
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:14,120
Sit down.

703
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:19,360
You'll take that seat. Sit right here.

704
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:21,520
As you wish.

705
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:34,320
You can't blame me for trying.

706
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:38,000
I don't blame you.
I don't blame you for anything.

707
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:40,760
The past is the past.

708
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:48,400
Now, give me what I need.

709
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,640
So, here it is. Your file, encrypted.

710
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:37,160
Who else has seen this?

711
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:38,960
No one.

712
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,040
Not even Morgan?

713
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:41,840
No.

714
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:46,240
As far as he's concerned,
you're an enigma and a mystery.

715
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:51,400
Gone.

716
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:52,440
Now...

717
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:55,560
Morgan, please.

718
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,120
This girl, this woman...

719
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:26,800
She is bright. She is kind.

720
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:30,800
And she knows nothing,
and she's nothing to you.

721
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:35,520
So I should let her live?

722
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:42,240
A little bit sentimental for you.

723
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:43,840
I'm dying, Falk.

724
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:48,120
Dying can bring out
the sentimental in a man.

725
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:55,520
Morgan's my protégé just as you were.

726
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:59,840
And whatever you think,
I'm not gonna betray him.

727
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:05,320
You betrayed him before.

728
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,480
Not this time.

729
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:09,240
So, if you don't mind,

730
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:13,120
you might just let an old man
rest his tired eyes,

731
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,520
and enjoy what's left of the evening.

732
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,760
Have it your way, old man.

733
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,120
Look what you did.

734
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:55,200
You...

735
01:03:56,640 --> 01:04:01,360
just lost the privilege
of a peaceful death.

736
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:26,920
Pick up, Caldwell.

737
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,000
Can I speak to Signor Chivasso, please?

738
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:46,640
Who's this?

739
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:05,400
Morgan Gaines.

740
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:08,600
Mom killed at age four. Dad gave you up.

741
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:11,640
Foster care kind of unpleasant.

742
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:13,680
I don't need my fucking history.
I've lived through it.

743
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:17,960
Royal Marine sniper
taken under the wing of Ian Caldwell,

744
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:21,880
who offered you the chance
to kill evil men for your government.

745
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:25,280
Except it wasn't always
for your government,

746
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:27,280
and the men weren't always evil.

747
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:33,840
You're a monster, Falk.

748
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:36,240
Or should I call you Agent Vos?

749
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:40,640
Well, Caldwell, that snake.

750
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:42,800
Did you know that he lied to you?

751
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:46,280
That he changed marks' background,
exaggerated their crimes,

752
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:48,440
omitted that they had children,
people that loved them.

753
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:50,560
Just like I assumed you loved your mom.

754
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:51,600
Time's running out.

755
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:54,480
After I kill Ryder, you're next.

756
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:59,080
Do you think that Caldwell
was trying to ease your conscience?

757
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:01,440
You think you're a good man,
don't you, Morgan?

758
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,120
You're just a slave to your emotions.

759
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:06,120
That's where we're different.

760
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:08,280
'Cause I'm free.

761
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:10,720
You want to get
to who's behind this or not?

762
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:13,840
My condolences, by the way, for Caldwell.

763
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,320
We all hope for a death without suffering.

764
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:17,800
In his case,

765
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:20,800
it simply was impossible.

766
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:22,560
Such a shame though.

767
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:25,560
I want to believe
that there's at least one person honest.

768
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,880
Well, at least you still have Sophie.

769
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:32,560
She's real cute.

770
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:34,200
Ryder will take care of her.

771
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:39,320
You got good taste.

772
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:02,960
Hey, you, I can't talk right now.

773
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:04,800
Sophie, you need to do exactly what I say.

774
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:07,080
Can I call you back? I was just...

775
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:09,520
There's someone coming for you.
You need to get to a safe house.

776
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:11,240
Get rid of your phone.
That can be tracked.

777
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:15,160
The address is 105 Via Roma,
apartment 42D.

778
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,320
What do you mean someone's coming for...

779
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:22,040
Sophie!

780
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:24,760
Fuck!

781
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:31,040
There's an active shooter
at Arcabaleno School.

782
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:33,280
-You need to hurry.
-Okay, we're on our way.

783
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,760
Sophie! Sophie!

784
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:37,680
Are you hurt?

785
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:40,080
Tell me what the fuck is going on.

786
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:47,680
Okay. You deserve the truth.

787
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:53,040
When I was younger, I joined the military.

788
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:57,520
I thought it was a just cause,
I thought I was doing my part for society.

789
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:01,240
Well, it turns out there's
a lot of red tape behind saving lives.

790
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:07,000
I need to show you something.

791
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,240
After I left the Royal Marines,

792
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:30,160
I met a man named Caldwell.

793
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:33,760
He became like a mentor to me.

794
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,160
Introduced me to this world.

795
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,680
He acted like a mediator between clients.

796
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:43,600
These clients wanted people dead.

797
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:48,000
Bad people.

798
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:52,560
Murderers, rapists, corrupt officials.

799
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:55,000
Over the years, I became numb.

800
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:57,800
It all became meaningless.

801
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:00,040
Until you came into my life.

802
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:02,520
You changed everything.

803
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:06,720
You showed me a life

804
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:11,280
that I thought I didn't deserve.

805
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:13,960
Now I need to fight to protect you.

806
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:16,280
Because I love you, Sophie.

807
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:19,360
I'm pregnant.

808
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:30,880
I leave tomorrow.

809
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:34,440
Go to my mother for a few weeks in Lisbon.

810
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:39,280
Then I'll be back to my job, to my life.

811
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:42,800
So whatever this is, you make it stop.

812
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:52,480
You leave tonight.

813
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:53,600
So?

814
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:54,640
There are two this time.

815
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:56,480
Two from the same person?

816
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:59,120
Nope there is a man's finger...

817
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:00,680
...and a woman's finger.

818
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:12,000
What did you get yourself into, old boy?

819
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:15,000
Why is that you chose the hard way out?

820
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:26,360
Jesus Christ.

821
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:28,840
Certainly wasn't loved as a kid.

822
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:10,040
Everything clear, yeah?

823
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:14,400
We know who we're dealing with.
Shoot to kill.

824
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:16,920
Let's go!

825
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,960
We just got confirmation
from the satellite footage.

826
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:23,080
Ryder and Morgan are here.

827
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:26,880
Don't worry, Jonna.
The nightmare stops today.

828
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:28,360
-We're gonna get him.
-Okay.

829
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:29,800
I will take you to the airport.

830
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:05,440
Laced with strychnine.

831
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:10,360
Very fatal and extremely fucking painful.

832
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:11,640
Why don't you take a seat?

833
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:23,040
It's quite the collection you have here.

834
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:25,640
Somewhat of a signature
for you now, isn't it?

835
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:30,880
I bet if I dig deep enough,
I'm gonna find Yakov Ilych's finger.

836
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:32,520
I don't know that person.

837
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:34,600
Don't fucking lie to me.

838
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:38,720
Good thing about strychnine is
it doesn't fuck with your brain.

839
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:40,800
So you're gonna know

840
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:44,240
when every single muscle in your body
contracts simultaneously.

841
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:48,160
The pain only intensifying
with the slightest of stimulation.

842
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:50,200
That's where I come in.

843
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:52,520
Now give my fucking answers

844
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:54,320
and I'll put you
out of your fucking misery!

845
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:55,760
Because she got to you, too?

846
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:59,480
Tell you it was in your common interest

847
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:01,960
to collaborate?

848
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:10,320
A little souvenir.

849
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,200
Go, go, go, go, go!

850
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:48,040
-Cover me!
-Let's go!

851
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:51,240
-Cover me! Cover me! Cover me!
-Quickly!

852
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,680
-Go, go, go, go, go!
-Go!

853
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:04,640
He's here!

854
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:13,120
-Captain!
-Go, go, go, go!

855
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:25,720
Cover me!

856
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:27,600
Captain!

857
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:32,720
-Go, go, go, go!
-Go, go, go!

858
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:38,280
He's here!

859
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:48,480
Go, go, go, go!

860
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:36,200
Get out of the car!

861
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:17,480
Go, go!

862
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:14,280
It's over!
Come out of the car with your hands up!

863
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:39,960
Move! Move! Move! Move!

864
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:44,960
Where is he?

865
01:22:58,160 --> 01:22:59,160
Find his body.

866
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:04,240
-Get me divers.
-Copy.

867
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,520
Yes, the current from the river
should bring the body back to the south.

868
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:34,760
Find me yet? Or you need a hint?

869
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:38,080
I'll call you back later.

870
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:40,480
The rules of that
little lying game we played,

871
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:41,560
you remember them, right?

872
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:44,160
Is kidnapping me again
absolutely necessary?

873
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:46,000
Just send me an email or call me.

874
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:50,320
The woman you're protecting,
you don't even know who the fuck she is.

875
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:53,440
Agent Vos and Falk are the same person.

876
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:55,120
She's using you to kill people.

877
01:23:57,160 --> 01:23:58,120
All right, let's go.

878
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:01,000
I have a plan to stop her,
but we need to move now.

879
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:04,680
You're going to help me
whether you like it or not.

880
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:07,520
Come on, Leon, I know you're a good man.

881
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:08,560
Where would she be?

882
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:12,520
Knowing her, waiting for your body.

883
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,040
Inspector Leon.

884
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:28,960
Sorry to call you late. We found his body.

885
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:30,080
Show me his face.

886
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:33,920
Sorry to interrupt, Falk, Agent Vos,
whatever your name is.

887
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:36,160
Falk, Agent Vos, whatever your name is.

888
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:38,520
Why don't you explain to Leon
who you really are?

889
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:43,720
What a disappointment you are.

890
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:22,720
Officer down. I need backup.
Request some backup now!

891
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:19,760
The brigade was alerted to the incident
at around 12:30 a.m.

892
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:23,880
It's not clear whether the incident
was an accident or deliberate.

893
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:28,800
Construction mogul Mariusz Ilych
wins parliament bid.

894
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:31,600
The mogul's late brother, Yakov Ilych,

895
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:35,800
founded the gas production empire
before his untimely death.

896
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:37,800
Yakov's daughter, Jonna Ilych,

897
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:40,400
supports her uncle, Mariusz,
in his campaign.

898
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:43,160
There will be a formal celebration
tomorrow in Prague.

899
01:27:56,240 --> 01:27:58,800
Thank you, Maxim.
You are done for today, you can go.

900
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:08,600
You forgot something?

901
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:09,640
Don't move.

902
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:13,240
Nice to meet you, Jonna.
Or should I call you Maat?

903
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:19,320
Maat? I don't know this person.

904
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:20,760
Of course you do.

905
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:23,040
You set up this game for vengeance.

906
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:25,920
But in fact, it was your uncle
who killed your father.

907
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:29,880
No. He paid someone like you to do that.

908
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:32,760
Just like you paid a group of us
to kill each other.

909
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:36,000
Six million dollars buys a lot of bodies.

910
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:37,040
I don't.

911
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:41,880
That money was to stop my uncle,
and to arrest all of you.

912
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:43,320
Arrest us?

913
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:45,720
How?

914
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:48,440
My uncle kept me close to control me.

915
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:51,080
Made me part of the machine helping him.

916
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:56,160
A mass murderer
seized power over an entire country.

917
01:28:57,320 --> 01:28:59,200
He liked to parade me out.

918
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:02,320
The poor orphan he saved.

919
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:04,000
But if I questioned him,

920
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:06,120
he would have
taken out a contract on me, too.

921
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:07,920
That's how he solved problems.

922
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:10,600
I was helping them to end this.

923
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:14,160
-Helping who?
-Agents.

924
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:15,840
Which agents?

925
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:19,840
Jonna Ilych? Agent Vos.

926
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:22,120
I'm taking over the investigation.

927
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:26,160
Inspector Leon, you report directly to me.

928
01:29:30,680 --> 01:29:33,560
So is everything on here?

929
01:29:33,640 --> 01:29:36,920
Yes. As much as I could gather
on my uncle's circle of assassins.

930
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,360
Targets, money transfers.

931
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:41,360
He kept encrypted records of everything.

932
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:45,360
What about him? Falk?

933
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:48,600
Do you have anything else on him?
His real name or...

934
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:51,760
No, he covers his tracks really well.
We have nothing on him.

935
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:53,320
Have you shown this to anyone else?

936
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:55,160
No.

937
01:29:55,240 --> 01:29:57,240
I am really sorry about your father.

938
01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:00,880
If we had enough money as bait,

939
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:04,960
we could offer a contract
to each of the assassins,

940
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:09,760
and then create some imaginary bait
for them to kill.

941
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:15,120
Lure them out of the shadows
and capture them.

942
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:17,760
How much money would you need?

943
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:23,120
The lead investigator,
do you know who she was?

944
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:24,640
Agent Vos.

945
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:27,240
Not the name she gave you, who she was.

946
01:30:27,640 --> 01:30:29,480
You handed those files over to Falk.

947
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:31,720
That's the woman that killed your father.

948
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:36,000
No.

949
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:39,000
No!

950
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:47,200
Once you did that,
she couldn't risk being exposed.

951
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:48,880
So she had to get rid of the evidence.

952
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:52,640
That meant your uncle,
the assassins he hired, and you.

953
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:53,960
So she created a deadly game

954
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:56,400
that she could manipulate
from behind the agency.

955
01:30:56,760 --> 01:31:00,080
Even used Leon,
fed him the exact lies to tell us.

956
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:01,120
But that's not...

957
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:03,080
My father's finger was cut off.

958
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:06,040
Falk mirrors methods of other assassins.

959
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:11,640
She was mimicking Ryder
to throw off the investigators.

960
01:31:13,160 --> 01:31:16,120
Everything she's done
has led to either trying to kill me,

961
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:18,240
or for me to stand here and kill you.

962
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:21,840
What about the money? Where is it?

963
01:31:22,720 --> 01:31:23,680
Gone.

964
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:28,520
The agency has no record of it,
or any meeting we ever had.

965
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:30,640
So the money never went to anyone.

966
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:33,080
Falk kept the money.

967
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:37,200
I got word from the agency
only an hour ago.

968
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:39,440
They told me Agent Vos is dead now.

969
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:43,600
She was on a mission in Italy,
and apparently had a heart attack.

970
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:14,360
Sophie.

971
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:16,320
It's just me. It's okay.

972
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,600
-Is it over?
-I hope so.

973
01:33:21,080 --> 01:33:22,440
I don't like that answer.

974
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:25,840
Oh, God, what did they do to you?

975
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:28,440
It's okay. It's okay.

976
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:30,000
I'll heal.

977
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:33,160
Listen, I can't stay for long.

978
01:33:33,240 --> 01:33:34,240
Where are you going?

979
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:36,440
I have to go back to the apartment.
I have to get some clothes.

980
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:39,000
I need you to do me a favor.
You keep the door closed.

981
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:41,360
If you're thinking about disappearing,
I don't want that.

982
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:43,480
We stay together.

983
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:47,520
You promised me.

984
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:57,840
-It's a girl?
-Our daughter.

985
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:21,480
Stupid kid.

986
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:44,240
Morgan, you know your biggest mistake?

987
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,120
You want to live.

988
01:34:48,120 --> 01:34:49,920
Not just survive,

989
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:51,640
but live.

990
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:55,320
Love. Care.

991
01:34:57,160 --> 01:35:01,160
It makes you vulnerable.
It makes you weak.

992
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:03,360
If you got a shot, you'd better take it.

993
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:05,120
No.

994
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:07,720
You're gonna suffer first.

995
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:09,640
Just like me.

996
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:13,640
How did you put it?

997
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:16,600
"Feel the consequences
of what you've done."

998
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:18,160
We have unfinished business.

999
01:35:18,240 --> 01:35:21,880
One last contract unfulfilled.

1000
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:23,760
You're going to kill yourself.

1001
01:35:24,120 --> 01:35:25,520
This conversation's over.

1002
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:29,360
You and me know better than anyone
that every life has a price.

1003
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:32,560
And I know yours.

1004
01:35:37,680 --> 01:35:39,040
You better run fast.

1005
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:41,080
You don't want to miss this show.

1006
01:35:57,720 --> 01:36:00,680
Leon, Falk is still alive. She has Sophie.

1007
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:02,080
I need you now.

1008
01:36:02,160 --> 01:36:04,160
I'm sending you an address. Be there.

1009
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:11,880
Sophie!

1010
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:23,280
Sophie!

1011
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:27,480
I'd be still if I were you.

1012
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:31,200
If you move your leg from that wire,
you're gonna blow up.

1013
01:36:32,640 --> 01:36:38,040
I guess we've got
a little bit less than five minutes left.

1014
01:36:44,160 --> 01:36:45,120
Give me your gun.

1015
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:48,600
Come on, give me your gun.

1016
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:50,480
Fuck!

1017
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:56,000
Good boy.

1018
01:36:57,720 --> 01:37:02,200
So, we got one last game to play.

1019
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:04,600
The game's done. It's over. You've won.

1020
01:37:04,680 --> 01:37:06,360
Let her go. There's nothing more.

1021
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:09,240
So here's the spin.

1022
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:12,160
That's a countdown to disarm.

1023
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:14,800
So in about four minutes you'll be safe,

1024
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:18,520
but Sophie would have drowned.

1025
01:37:18,920 --> 01:37:20,480
So you got a decision to make.

1026
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,920
Either you watch
the mother of your unborn child die

1027
01:37:24,360 --> 01:37:26,440
or you let the bomb go off,

1028
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:28,880
and you all die together,
which is romantic.

1029
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:33,080
Whatever choice you make I win, you lose.

1030
01:37:33,640 --> 01:37:34,840
The game is mine.

1031
01:37:36,160 --> 01:37:39,840
So do you know if it's a boy or a girl?

1032
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:41,840
Have you thought about a name?

1033
01:37:42,520 --> 01:37:45,000
'Cause I think Falk is pretty cute.

1034
01:37:50,360 --> 01:37:51,320
Hey.

1035
01:37:52,680 --> 01:37:53,880
Come on, get up now.

1036
01:37:54,920 --> 01:37:57,440
Get up. Turn around. Show me your face.

1037
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:19,840
Have fun. Ciao.

1038
01:38:21,120 --> 01:38:22,080
Sophie!

1039
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,120
Just stay calm.

1040
01:38:29,200 --> 01:38:30,440
Stay calm, baby.

1041
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:49,080
Leon.

1042
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:52,080
Help us. Please!

1043
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:18,160
Hurry up, Leon!

1044
01:39:50,360 --> 01:39:51,360
Sophie, stay with me.

1045
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:54,520
Stay there just a couple seconds.

1046
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:01,800
Okay.

1047
01:40:02,720 --> 01:40:03,880
Baby, stay with me.

1048
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:07,680
Don't die! Breathe!

1049
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:11,360
Wake up.

1050
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:20,280
Don't die on me, baby. Sophie, wake up!

1051
01:40:30,920 --> 01:40:33,720
Baby. Okay. Baby. It's okay.

1052
01:40:34,640 --> 01:40:36,440
Baby. Oh, my God.

1053
01:40:36,640 --> 01:40:38,880
-Fucking bastard.
-No, no, no. Sophie, it's me!

1054
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:40,680
-You told me it was safe!
-Sophie, it's me! Okay.

1055
01:40:40,760 --> 01:40:43,440
-You told me we were safe.
-It's okay. We're safe now. Okay.

1056
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:45,000
We're safe now. Okay.

1057
01:40:45,080 --> 01:40:47,520
Just breathe. Just breathe. Okay.

1058
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:50,320
I thought I lost you, baby.

1059
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:52,840
