2
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:38,595
Jared.

3
00:00:38,597 --> 00:00:40,599
Why are you upset, honey?

4
00:00:40,601 --> 00:00:42,133
I want my jersey.

5
00:00:42,135 --> 00:00:45,071
- Well, it's because it's dirty.
- I want it.

6
00:00:49,243 --> 00:00:52,578
You know, today is
your first day of school.

7
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:55,748
What?

8
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,084
You like to play
something in particular?

9
00:00:58,086 --> 00:01:01,521
- Uh, soccer!
- You like to play soccer. And?

10
00:01:01,523 --> 00:01:03,524
And basketball!

11
00:01:03,526 --> 00:01:05,760
What's your favorite color?

12
00:01:05,762 --> 00:01:07,762
Uh...

13
00:01:07,764 --> 00:01:09,764
Uh, blue and yellow.

14
00:01:09,766 --> 00:01:11,499
- Blue...
- And yellow.

15
00:01:11,501 --> 00:01:13,868
- and... yellow.
- Yellow.

16
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,605
What would you like to be
when you grow up?

17
00:01:16,607 --> 00:01:18,607
Motorcycle driver!

18
00:01:24,616 --> 00:01:26,683
Bye! Hi!

19
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:36,360
Jared?

20
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:39,299
You should come down
for breakfast.

21
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:51,345
<i>I wish none of this
had ever happened.</i>

22
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:56,819
<i>But sometimes
I thank God that it did.</i>

23
00:03:07,098 --> 00:03:09,098
<i>Just repeat after me.</i>

24
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,633
<i>Let your light shine.</i>

25
00:03:10,635 --> 00:03:12,168
Let your light shine.

26
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,939
Now, let me see a show of hands
of those of you

27
00:03:14,941 --> 00:03:16,841
in this room who are imperfect.

28
00:03:16,843 --> 00:03:19,276
Everybody.

29
00:03:19,278 --> 00:03:21,980
That's right.
And a show of hands

30
00:03:21,982 --> 00:03:24,916
for everybody in this room
who is perfect.

31
00:03:24,918 --> 00:03:27,954
- Nobody.
- Amen.

32
00:03:27,956 --> 00:03:29,522
I am blessed

33
00:03:29,524 --> 00:03:33,426
with a beautiful
and deeply soulful wife,

34
00:03:33,428 --> 00:03:37,465
and with a fine...
upstanding...

35
00:03:38,667 --> 00:03:40,668
...and honest son.

36
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,971
I'm a lucky man,

37
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:46,175
and I'm grateful
for those blessings.

38
00:03:57,288 --> 00:04:00,857
Please don't do that.
You know that makes me nervous.

39
00:04:00,859 --> 00:04:02,525
What if a truck comes along

40
00:04:02,527 --> 00:04:04,729
- and hits your arm?
- It's never gonna happen.

41
00:04:04,731 --> 00:04:06,797
It's happened before.

42
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,167
It has. It has.

43
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:42,370
Morning.
Welcome to Love in Action.

44
00:04:42,372 --> 00:04:44,272
Hi.

45
00:04:44,274 --> 00:04:48,711
- Name?
- Uh, Nancy Eamons.

46
00:04:48,713 --> 00:04:50,846
Oh, um... the boy, I mean.

47
00:04:50,848 --> 00:04:53,050
- Unless you're the one checking in.
- Oh.

48
00:04:53,052 --> 00:04:55,252
- Jared Eamons.
- Jared Eamons.

49
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:57,189
Jared. Got you right here.

50
00:05:03,362 --> 00:05:05,596
Great.

51
00:05:05,598 --> 00:05:07,532
Do you want to say
your good-byes?

52
00:05:07,534 --> 00:05:09,601
- Can I see the place?
- I'm afraid you won't be allowed

53
00:05:09,603 --> 00:05:11,603
- beyond the reception area, Mrs. Eamons.
- Oh.

54
00:05:11,605 --> 00:05:15,376
- But you can pick him up at 5:00 p.m.
- Okay.

55
00:05:17,045 --> 00:05:19,548
- It's okay, Mom.
- Mm.

56
00:05:22,818 --> 00:05:24,617
Well, call me anytime.

57
00:05:24,619 --> 00:05:27,054
I'll be at the hotel
on my cell phone.

58
00:05:27,056 --> 00:05:28,957
Uh, we will be holding
his cell phone.

59
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,893
If there are any emergencies,
we will contact you,

60
00:05:31,895 --> 00:05:34,263
but otherwise, 5:00 p.m.

61
00:05:36,934 --> 00:05:38,736
Mm.

62
00:05:40,472 --> 00:05:42,774
You'll do great.

63
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:46,644
Love you.

64
00:05:48,413 --> 00:05:50,582
<i>Newbie. Eamons.</i>

65
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:54,420
Empty your pockets.

66
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,597
Do you have
any numbers or photos

67
00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:06,967
we should be concerned about?

68
00:06:06,969 --> 00:06:10,336
We'll check it daily
and call any number at random,

69
00:06:10,338 --> 00:06:12,672
so you best be straight
with us on that.

70
00:06:12,674 --> 00:06:14,674
There's nothing. And, yeah,
call whatever numbers,

71
00:06:14,676 --> 00:06:15,779
if you need to.

72
00:06:17,781 --> 00:06:19,279
"Sobriety...

"Attire...

<i>What's that?</i>

79
00:06:34,032 --> 00:06:36,833
Oh, it-it's, um, I...

80
00:06:36,835 --> 00:06:39,537
I write, I write stories.
Uh, I'm studying it at college.

81
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:42,206
No journaling.
We're gonna have to read that.

82
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:43,474
<i>"Confidentiality...</i>

00:06:43,476 --> 00:06:45,910

<i>- Your handbook.

- Good luck.
- Thank you.

Michael for Aaron.

94
00:07:40,274 --> 00:07:42,607
How many clients
are we expecting today?

95
00:07:42,609 --> 00:07:44,475
Copy, Michael. Hold, please.

96
00:07:44,477 --> 00:07:47,112
Uh, just one second, Jared.

97
00:07:47,114 --> 00:07:49,315
We should have 11 today.

98
00:07:49,317 --> 00:07:51,216
Well, we have
more in the lobby.

99
00:07:51,218 --> 00:07:53,386
It's okay. We should
have another five minutes.

100
00:07:53,388 --> 00:07:54,420
- All right.
- Copy.

101
00:07:54,422 --> 00:07:56,056
Jared, if you just want to go

102
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:58,259
find yourself a seat and, uh,
make yourself comfortable.

103
00:07:58,261 --> 00:08:00,261
We'll get started soon.

104
00:08:05,802 --> 00:08:07,804
- Hi.
- Hi.

105
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,282
- Morning.
- Hi.

106
00:08:18,284 --> 00:08:20,284
<i>"...sinful, salacious,</i>

107
00:08:20,286 --> 00:08:22,085
<i>"and extraneous materials.</i>

108
00:08:22,087 --> 00:08:24,654
"All reading material
and films and television

109
00:08:24,656 --> 00:08:27,090

110
00:08:29,262 --> 00:08:32,530
<i>I am using sexual sin</i>

111
00:08:32,532 --> 00:08:34,333
and homosexuality

112
00:08:34,335 --> 00:08:37,502
to fill a God-shaped void
in my life.

113
00:08:37,504 --> 00:08:39,672
I am using sexual sin

114
00:08:39,674 --> 00:08:43,877
and homosexuality to fill
a God-shaped void in my life.

115
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:48,315
But I am not broken,
and God loves me.

116
00:08:48,317 --> 00:08:49,883
But I am not broken,

117
00:08:49,885 --> 00:08:52,820
- and God loves me.
- Good. That is very true.

118
00:08:52,822 --> 00:08:56,626
Now, somebody tell me
what this is.

119
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,328
Dollar.

120
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,630
A dollar.
Now, no matter how much

121
00:09:02,632 --> 00:09:04,866
you crumple up a dollar bill...

122
00:09:04,868 --> 00:09:07,471
you can never take away
its value.

123
00:09:08,505 --> 00:09:11,641
Now, even if you were
to rip it...

124
00:09:11,643 --> 00:09:14,310
which would represent
our being severed from Christ...

125
00:09:14,312 --> 00:09:16,714
well, guess what?

126
00:09:16,716 --> 00:09:19,483
You can always
tape it back together.

127
00:09:19,485 --> 00:09:21,819
Jesus puts us back together.

128
00:09:21,821 --> 00:09:24,488
And even though
there is a scar,

129
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,824
our value does not change.

130
00:09:26,826 --> 00:09:29,761
- You are somebody.
- Sorry.

131
00:09:29,763 --> 00:09:32,331
You are worth something.
That's okay, Jon. Sit down.

132
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:33,666
And that is a fact.

133
00:09:33,668 --> 00:09:35,768
Don't spend it
all at once, Phillip.

134
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,737
Now, this may be the toughest

135
00:09:37,739 --> 00:09:41,575
but most rewarding 12 days that
many of you will ever face.

136
00:09:41,577 --> 00:09:43,577
But we have just one task:

137
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:47,948
to bring ourselves back to God.

138
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,750
To invite him back in.

139
00:09:49,752 --> 00:09:51,753
To understand how
he truly meant to create us

140
00:09:51,755 --> 00:09:54,223
before all those pieces
got torn away.

141
00:09:54,225 --> 00:09:57,126
Now, look, I know
the road here wasn't easy

142
00:09:57,128 --> 00:09:58,861
for many of you.

143
00:09:58,863 --> 00:10:01,630
But I promise a smoother ride
now that you're here,

144
00:10:01,632 --> 00:10:08,038
because we are about to go
on an amazing journey together.

145
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,908
So who's ready?

146
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:14,778
That was a question.
Who's ready? Say "amen."

147
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,547
- Amen.
- Amen.

148
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:19,217
If you know you're worth
a dollar, say "amen."

149
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:21,420
Amen.

150
00:10:21,422 --> 00:10:23,423
Welcome to the Refuge program!

151
00:10:23,425 --> 00:10:26,224
Come on!

152
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:28,228
<i>That's right, great souls!</i>

153
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,962
<i>Great!</i>

154
00:10:38,908 --> 00:10:40,909
<i>Now, I'm gonna tell you
something that's</i>

155
00:10:40,911 --> 00:10:44,079
<i>gonna make you immediately
feel a little better.</i>

156
00:10:44,081 --> 00:10:47,015
People tell you you can be
born gay; that's not true.

157
00:10:47,017 --> 00:10:50,419
You cannot be born
a homosexual; this is a lie.

158
00:10:50,421 --> 00:10:53,356
Now, I'm a counselor
and a pastor,

159
00:10:53,358 --> 00:10:55,492
but was I born that way?

160
00:10:55,494 --> 00:10:57,360
No.

161
00:10:57,362 --> 00:11:01,098
It's behavioral. It's a choice.

162
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:05,103
Cameron, you-you, uh,
play football?

163
00:11:05,105 --> 00:11:06,604
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

164
00:11:06,606 --> 00:11:08,306
Were you born that way?

165
00:11:08,308 --> 00:11:09,941
- No.
- No.

166
00:11:09,943 --> 00:11:13,278
Now, you chose to be
a football player, right?

167
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,779
It's behavior.

168
00:11:14,781 --> 00:11:16,815
Now, if you... if Cameron
stops playing football,

169
00:11:16,817 --> 00:11:18,518
he no longer is
a football player.

170
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,788
We got to learn for ourselves
where behavior comes from,

171
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,289
so we can cut it out,

172
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:26,626
and then we can no longer
be labeled that way.

173
00:11:26,628 --> 00:11:29,396
Now, who could tell us
what a genogram is?

174
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:30,798
Phillip.

175
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,167
Well, a genogram's
like a family tree,

176
00:11:33,169 --> 00:11:36,538
only one that shows patterns
of family behavior as well.

177
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,306
Sort of like
an illustrated one.

178
00:11:38,308 --> 00:11:42,644
Yes. Now, we are going to draw
our family tree,

179
00:11:42,646 --> 00:11:45,214
and we're gonna list
next to these people

180
00:11:45,216 --> 00:11:47,216
their behavioral sin.

181
00:11:47,218 --> 00:11:50,019
So, they made us...

182
00:11:50,021 --> 00:11:52,656
and they labeled us,
so we're gonna label them.

183
00:11:52,658 --> 00:11:55,694
Michael, can you read
the behavioral sins?

184
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:00,697
We use the letters "SSA" or "H"

185
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:05,371
to label same sex attraction
or homosexuality.

186
00:12:05,373 --> 00:12:07,506
"D" for drugs.

187
00:12:07,508 --> 00:12:10,276
A dollar sign for gambling.

188
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:12,778
"A," alcoholism.

189
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:15,382
"P," promiscuity.

190
00:12:15,384 --> 00:12:18,084
"M," mental illness.

191
00:12:18,086 --> 00:12:21,255
Capital "A" lowercase "B"
for abortion.

192
00:12:21,257 --> 00:12:24,292
Capital "P" lowercase "O"
for pornography.

193
00:12:24,294 --> 00:12:27,728
And "C" or "G,"
criminal or gang affiliation.

194
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:30,265
Forgetting "DV,"
domestic violence.

195
00:12:30,267 --> 00:12:33,969
Capital "D" lowercase
"V," domestic violence.

196
00:12:33,971 --> 00:12:36,238
Okay, guys,
let's dive right in.

197
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,443
Let's grab some cards
and some markers.

198
00:12:39,445 --> 00:12:42,246
I want you to write 'em down...

199
00:12:42,248 --> 00:12:44,881
and put the letters
next to their name.

200
00:12:44,883 --> 00:12:46,916
I know they're family,

201
00:12:46,918 --> 00:12:50,387
but I can guarantee that one
or some of these people

202
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:53,727
are the reason that
you're at Love in Action.

203
00:12:55,162 --> 00:12:58,897
So, Jared, you must be
the preacher's son.

204
00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:01,833
You know or you don't know.

205
00:13:01,835 --> 00:13:04,571
What's the question mark for?

206
00:13:04,573 --> 00:13:07,309
Uncle Chris is an alcoholic.

207
00:13:09,645 --> 00:13:11,278
Hmm.

208
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:15,015
Well, this must be pretty tough
on your family, hmm?

209
00:13:15,017 --> 00:13:18,753
"Give ear,
O my people, to my law.

210
00:13:18,755 --> 00:13:21,322
"Incline your ears
to the words of my mouth.

211
00:13:21,324 --> 00:13:24,158
"I will open my mouth
in a parable.

212
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,497
I will utter dark sayings
which we have heard."

213
00:13:27,499 --> 00:13:30,799
- No.
- Sounds good, Dad.

214
00:13:30,801 --> 00:13:32,669
Are you ready?
We got to get going.

215
00:13:32,671 --> 00:13:34,938
Why are we going
to Dallas tomorrow?

216
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,941
Architect's updated the, uh,
remodel plans for the ministry,

217
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:39,944
and we're gonna take a tour

218
00:13:39,946 --> 00:13:42,949
of two similar churches
right there.

219
00:13:44,217 --> 00:13:46,784
Do you think
I could stay at Chloe's

220
00:13:46,786 --> 00:13:48,955
when you go, instead?

221
00:13:52,026 --> 00:13:53,459
It's okay,
I can stay at Wayne's.

222
00:13:53,461 --> 00:13:55,561
- Or-or I'll just...
- I am okay with that.

223
00:13:55,563 --> 00:13:58,331
In fact, I think
it is a great idea.

224
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,199
You're both mature kids

225
00:14:00,201 --> 00:14:02,302
who know how
to conduct themselves,

226
00:14:02,304 --> 00:14:05,039
and who, by now,
know how the world works.

227
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:10,712
You know, son,
small steps toward manhood.

228
00:14:10,714 --> 00:14:12,547
That's the way to learn.

229
00:14:12,549 --> 00:14:14,649
That way you don't
get all panicky

230
00:14:14,651 --> 00:14:17,920
when it suddenly arrives.

231
00:14:17,922 --> 00:14:19,989
You do know
what I'm saying, Romeo?

232
00:14:19,991 --> 00:14:21,991
- Yes, sir.
- Okay. Let's go. We're late.

233
00:14:21,993 --> 00:14:23,694
<i>Dear Heavenly Father,</i>

234
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,662
<i>we thank you
for this beautiful day.</i>

235
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:28,065
<i>And, Lord, we pray
that you look over our shoulder</i>

236
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,568
<i>as we march out onto the floor,</i>

237
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,003
<i>and that we show our customers
the love and kindness</i>

238
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:34,905
<i>that you show us.</i>

239
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:36,873
<i>In Jesus Christ's name,
and for his sake...</i>

240
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,710
Morning! Let your light shine!

241
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:40,045
- Amen.
- Amen.

242
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:41,580
- All right!
- Have a great day.

243
00:14:50,191 --> 00:14:52,460
"Rebels" on three!
On three! One, two, three!

244
00:14:52,462 --> 00:14:54,027
Rebels!

245
00:14:57,367 --> 00:14:59,367
You did so good.

246
00:15:00,803 --> 00:15:02,269
Right, buddy? Assists,

247
00:15:02,271 --> 00:15:04,873
one of the most underrated
components of the game.

248
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:05,874
- Congratulations.
- I saw you

249
00:15:05,876 --> 00:15:07,376
setting up all the points.

250
00:15:07,378 --> 00:15:09,444
- Oh! That's victory sweat.
- Dad, I... - Yeah.

251
00:15:09,446 --> 00:15:11,113
I-I played, like, five minutes.

252
00:15:11,115 --> 00:15:13,081
- I think you did more than that. How about you?
- Hey!

253
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,284
- Another underrated component of the game.
- Thank you.

254
00:15:15,286 --> 00:15:17,153
- How are you?
- Congratulations, beautiful girl.

255
00:15:17,155 --> 00:15:18,921
I was worried about you.
I thought they were

256
00:15:18,923 --> 00:15:20,457
- gonna drop you. Oh.
- Oh, no, don't worry.

257
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:22,559
- Are you kids gonna go celebrate?
- Yeah, some of us,

258
00:15:22,561 --> 00:15:24,061
- I think we're gonna go to the lake.
- Yeah.

259
00:15:24,063 --> 00:15:27,599
All right. The lake.

260
00:15:27,601 --> 00:15:29,234
All right.

261
00:15:29,236 --> 00:15:31,403
Dealership's gonna put me
in an Expedition,

262
00:15:31,405 --> 00:15:33,405
so it's yours.

263
00:15:33,407 --> 00:15:35,273
Wow. Dad.

264
00:15:35,275 --> 00:15:36,742
All right. All right.
It was gonna be

265
00:15:36,744 --> 00:15:39,078
for your birthday, but, you
know, tonight's a good night,

266
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,414
- so congratulations.
- Thank you so much.

267
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:42,948
- Thank you.
- Go and have fun.

268
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,950
I want to see if your mama
wants to go to the lake.

269
00:16:22,128 --> 00:16:23,662
They're still up.

270
00:16:41,551 --> 00:16:43,052
What?

271
00:16:48,057 --> 00:16:50,758
I-If it's not hard,
I can make it hard.

272
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,029
Don't you think
we should wait until,

273
00:16:54,031 --> 00:16:56,432
- you know...
- Until...

274
00:16:56,434 --> 00:17:00,503
- You know?
- Until what? We get married?

275
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:06,744
That's what my parents
think we should do.

276
00:17:06,746 --> 00:17:09,849
To keep us together
through college.

277
00:17:15,723 --> 00:17:17,424
Hey.

278
00:17:19,861 --> 00:17:22,227
Is something wrong?

279
00:17:22,229 --> 00:17:24,365
No.

280
00:17:26,701 --> 00:17:29,202
Jared.

281
00:17:29,204 --> 00:17:32,038
Ready to pack it up?
We're about done for the day.

282
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,708
Looks nice.

283
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:37,311
5:00, everyone.
It's home time.

284
00:17:37,313 --> 00:17:40,551
- Bye.
- 5:00. Let's go.

285
00:17:43,387 --> 00:17:45,588
All right, everybody,

286
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,489
pack it up.

287
00:17:47,491 --> 00:17:50,091
Name tag.

288
00:17:50,093 --> 00:17:53,265
- Thanks.
- 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.

289
00:18:00,239 --> 00:18:02,006
Uh...

290
00:18:02,008 --> 00:18:04,910
hey, y-you tore out the pages.

291
00:18:04,912 --> 00:18:07,178
- Mm.
- They're just stories.

292
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,747
Mr. Sykes will decide that.

293
00:18:08,749 --> 00:18:11,584
...to Michael.

294
00:18:11,586 --> 00:18:15,524
- Go for Michael.
- Are you still in the office?

295
00:18:35,813 --> 00:18:37,613
Are you, are you a soldier?

296
00:18:37,615 --> 00:18:39,616
Were you in the military,
or some...?

297
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,318
- I saw you salute earlier. I thought...
- No.

298
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,788
I'm trying zero contact
whatsoever.

299
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:49,059
- Mm.
- 23 days now.

300
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:53,033
So... I salute instead.

301
00:18:54,568 --> 00:18:58,135
This group seems good.

302
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,471
Have you been here before?

303
00:18:59,473 --> 00:19:02,674
Yeah, it's my second time
in the Refuge program.

304
00:19:02,676 --> 00:19:04,644
I started a couple days late
last time,

305
00:19:04,646 --> 00:19:06,980
and actually I'm waiting
for a place to open

306
00:19:06,982 --> 00:19:08,982
in one of the houses.

307
00:19:08,984 --> 00:19:11,550
- What houses?
- The-the houses. The...

308
00:19:11,552 --> 00:19:13,820
They have a few houses
behind the property

309
00:19:13,822 --> 00:19:15,489
for the long stayers.

310
00:19:15,491 --> 00:19:18,325
Meanwhile,
I'm stuck at the Baybrook

311
00:19:18,327 --> 00:19:21,364
with my dad,
which is interesting.

312
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:27,002
Are you in one of
the local hotels, too?

313
00:19:27,004 --> 00:19:28,673
Yeah.

314
00:19:30,508 --> 00:19:33,511
So, like, how-how long
will you stay for?

315
00:19:35,113 --> 00:19:37,113
It's not really up to me.

316
00:19:37,115 --> 00:19:39,517
Mr. Sykes decides.

317
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:43,286
- No one explained that to you?
- No, no.

318
00:19:43,288 --> 00:19:45,923
This is just
an assessment program,

319
00:19:45,925 --> 00:19:49,694
until they know
what to do with you.

320
00:19:49,696 --> 00:19:51,863
Hey. Listen.

321
00:19:51,865 --> 00:19:53,866
Just lean into it, man.

322
00:19:53,868 --> 00:19:55,467
Yeah.

323
00:19:55,469 --> 00:19:58,938
Do the work,
and trust me, man...

324
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,473
you're gonna love it here.

325
00:20:01,475 --> 00:20:04,310
<i>Aren't you gonna tell me
about your day?</i>

326
00:20:04,312 --> 00:20:07,781
We're not meant to talk
about it outside of group.

327
00:20:07,783 --> 00:20:09,116
I don't need gossip.

328
00:20:09,118 --> 00:20:12,953
I just...
I just mean generally.

329
00:20:12,955 --> 00:20:14,957
I'm gonna lean into it.

330
00:20:14,959 --> 00:20:17,059
And there are some good people.

331
00:20:17,061 --> 00:20:19,729
And, yeah, I like it.

332
00:20:19,731 --> 00:20:21,664
I'm excited to be here.

333
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:24,102
That's good.

334
00:20:30,142 --> 00:20:32,609
Do we have people in the family

335
00:20:32,611 --> 00:20:35,814
who had issues
with any of this stuff?

336
00:20:46,861 --> 00:20:48,861
Pornography?

337
00:20:48,863 --> 00:20:51,433
Mom.

338
00:20:55,937 --> 00:20:57,804
Drugs?

339
00:20:57,806 --> 00:20:59,006
Gang affiliat...

340
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:01,274
Gang affiliations?
What is this?

341
00:21:01,276 --> 00:21:03,145
I need to know for homework.

342
00:21:03,147 --> 00:21:06,148
Why do they need to know
about the family?

343
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:08,819
Our family is so normal.

344
00:21:35,816 --> 00:21:39,084
Big day tomorrow, hmm?

345
00:21:39,086 --> 00:21:41,556
You get some good sleep, now.

346
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,663
Oh, um, I filled out
your homework for you.

347
00:21:51,835 --> 00:21:55,503
I was only in a gang
for a year or so, until I...

348
00:21:55,505 --> 00:22:00,242
went down for drugs,
got sent to prison.

349
00:22:00,244 --> 00:22:01,709
Ha-ha.

350
00:22:07,685 --> 00:22:10,619
I put your Uncle Vincent
down there.

351
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:13,555
You've never met him, 'cause
he, uh, moved to Louisiana

352
00:22:13,557 --> 00:22:17,962
when you were little, so...
we just never see him.

353
00:22:17,964 --> 00:22:20,600
We always figured that he...

354
00:22:26,707 --> 00:22:31,043
He was very feminine-like,
you might say.

355
00:22:31,045 --> 00:22:33,478
All right.

356
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,317
Oh. I'm tired.

357
00:22:37,552 --> 00:22:39,722
- Night-night.
- Good night.

358
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:50,665
<i>What is... a real man?</i>

359
00:22:50,667 --> 00:22:54,236
<i>And what does
a real man look like?</i>

360
00:22:54,238 --> 00:22:56,406
<i>Does anybody know?</i>

361
00:22:57,942 --> 00:22:59,909
Guys, uncross your legs.

362
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:01,510
Posture. Come on.

363
00:23:01,512 --> 00:23:04,447
Now, perhaps being close

364
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:08,919
to the flames of hell
and finding your way back

365
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:11,088
shows a great strength.

366
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:15,160
And if that were so, then...
if this isn't a real man,

367
00:23:15,162 --> 00:23:17,162
then I don't know what is.

368
00:23:17,164 --> 00:23:18,462
This is Brandon Ellis, guys.

369
00:23:18,464 --> 00:23:20,332
- I want you to say hello.
- Thanks, Sykes.

370
00:23:20,334 --> 00:23:22,267
Make him welcome.
Over to you, Brandon.

371
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:23,604
Thank you.

372
00:23:24,538 --> 00:23:27,440
God bless. God bless.

373
00:23:27,442 --> 00:23:28,942
A real man, to me,

374
00:23:28,944 --> 00:23:31,678
is a man of God,
first and foremost.

375
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,681
And I'm a man of God, no doubt.

376
00:23:34,683 --> 00:23:37,952
I guess that counts me in.

377
00:23:37,954 --> 00:23:40,121
But I wasn't once.

378
00:23:40,123 --> 00:23:43,524
If I was ever listed
on my own son's genograms,

379
00:23:43,526 --> 00:23:45,961
there'd be so many of these
letters next to my name,

380
00:23:45,963 --> 00:23:48,331
it would look
like qualifications

381
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:50,633
for some fancy university.

382
00:23:50,635 --> 00:23:53,002
Drugs, violence, gang crime,

383
00:23:53,004 --> 00:23:55,205
prison time,
but I actually believe

384
00:23:55,207 --> 00:23:57,007
I'm qualified to be here.

385
00:23:57,009 --> 00:24:00,210
Not because I've ever had the
types of thoughts and feelings

386
00:24:00,212 --> 00:24:01,912
that y'all are wrestling with

387
00:24:01,914 --> 00:24:03,547
or that your other
guidance counselors

388
00:24:03,549 --> 00:24:05,515
have overcome righteously.

389
00:24:05,517 --> 00:24:07,752
But I've had all sorts
of my own trials

390
00:24:07,754 --> 00:24:10,321
that took me so far away
from the Lord

391
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:12,424
that it is a true miracle

392
00:24:12,426 --> 00:24:14,996
that I'm standing here
before you today.

393
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:18,231
But I am.

394
00:24:18,233 --> 00:24:20,335
I am.

395
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,342
<i>Standing, leaning, sitting.</i>

396
00:24:28,344 --> 00:24:30,044
<i>All the same idea.</i>

397
00:24:30,046 --> 00:24:33,514
Triangles are
the strongest shape.

398
00:24:33,516 --> 00:24:36,451
Hand or hands on hips. Go!

399
00:24:36,453 --> 00:24:38,889
Save yourself.

400
00:24:40,724 --> 00:24:43,525
Fingers forward, not back.

401
00:24:43,527 --> 00:24:45,228
Just the way it is.

402
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:49,065
Think of the shapes
you're making and ask yourself:

403
00:24:49,067 --> 00:24:51,602
Is this a manly shape
I'm making,

404
00:24:51,604 --> 00:24:55,373
or is it a girly
or feminine shape?

405
00:24:55,375 --> 00:24:56,907
Sarah, come on up here.

406
00:24:56,909 --> 00:25:00,111
Come on,
you delicate flower, you.

407
00:25:00,113 --> 00:25:01,545
Okay.

408
00:25:01,547 --> 00:25:05,384
I want you to arrange
these guys into a line

409
00:25:05,386 --> 00:25:08,089
in terms of masculinity,
if you will.

410
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:11,589
Go on, you can do it.

411
00:25:11,591 --> 00:25:13,928
Follow your instincts.

412
00:25:16,298 --> 00:25:18,632
Myself and other addicts
and alcoholics

413
00:25:18,634 --> 00:25:20,734
put our faith in AA.

414
00:25:20,736 --> 00:25:23,237
- Get familiar with this phrase:
<i>- Knees up!</i>

415
00:25:23,239 --> 00:25:26,140
<i>- Fake it till you make it.</i>
- Knees up! Body up! Push!

416
00:25:26,142 --> 00:25:30,145
<i>And y'all folks and kids, being
what you're afflicted with,</i>

417
00:25:30,147 --> 00:25:31,747
better learn how to survive.

418
00:25:31,749 --> 00:25:33,916
<i>When you're in prison,</i>

419
00:25:33,918 --> 00:25:37,152
<i>you'd surprise yourself
what you could do to fit in.</i>

420
00:25:37,154 --> 00:25:38,320
Come on, Phillip.

421
00:25:38,322 --> 00:25:40,491
Eye on the ball.

422
00:25:40,493 --> 00:25:41,858
Come on! Okay, next!

423
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:44,295
<i>Fake it till you make it.</i>

424
00:25:44,297 --> 00:25:45,529
Become the man you are not.

425
00:25:45,531 --> 00:25:46,629
So you think Cameron here

426
00:25:46,631 --> 00:25:48,832
<i>is the big winner, huh?</i>

427
00:25:48,834 --> 00:25:51,369
You think being big and tall

428
00:25:51,371 --> 00:25:53,939
and overeating

429
00:25:53,941 --> 00:25:56,274
immediately puts a guy
at the front of the line.

430
00:25:56,276 --> 00:25:58,643
<i>But it's more than triangles
or postures</i>

431
00:25:58,645 --> 00:26:00,278
and genetics.

432
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,980
Firm handshake!

433
00:26:01,982 --> 00:26:04,485
Let's go! Do it!

434
00:26:04,487 --> 00:26:06,054
You got to pick up the bat.

435
00:26:07,055 --> 00:26:08,455
Hold the bat up!

436
00:26:08,457 --> 00:26:09,822
- Ow!
- Ooh! -

437
00:26:09,824 --> 00:26:12,126
Get back up on that horse!

438
00:26:12,128 --> 00:26:15,029
All right,
just get him out of there.

439
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:17,799
- Lee, you're gonna be okay.
- Come on.

440
00:26:17,801 --> 00:26:20,971
Jared, you're up next.

441
00:26:22,005 --> 00:26:23,707
That's good.

442
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,045
Military man.

443
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:31,814
God bless, son.

444
00:26:31,816 --> 00:26:35,818
Who you are on the inside
can be affected by the outside.

445
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:39,323
Outside in.
Fake it till you make it.

446
00:26:39,325 --> 00:26:40,491
Adapt to survive.

447
00:26:40,493 --> 00:26:43,327
Ah, see,
that's a batting stance.

448
00:26:43,329 --> 00:26:44,563
That's what I'm talking about.

449
00:26:44,565 --> 00:26:46,500
Boom!

450
00:26:57,846 --> 00:27:00,747
<i>Lesbian, gay, bisexual,</i>

451
00:27:00,749 --> 00:27:02,883
transsexual...
whatever that is...

452
00:27:02,885 --> 00:27:05,953
multisexual,
intellectual sexual.

453
00:27:05,955 --> 00:27:07,955
I mean, what else do you want?

454
00:27:07,957 --> 00:27:10,024
Unicorns? Squirrels?

455
00:27:10,026 --> 00:27:12,594
Cupcakes? I mean, rainbows?

456
00:27:12,596 --> 00:27:15,864
There's so much choice
in this group,

457
00:27:15,866 --> 00:27:18,034
but, hey, think about this.

458
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:23,539
What are the consequences
to those choices?

459
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:25,408
Have a look at this.

460
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,778
Rape, abuse, AIDS.

461
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:31,884
What sinful things
have y'all done?

462
00:27:36,223 --> 00:27:38,256
<i>Moral inventory.</i>

463
00:27:38,258 --> 00:27:43,730
<i>Catalog your sins
and ask God's forgiveness.</i>

464
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:48,570
Who is ready?

465
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,242
Sarah.

466
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,823
"I would look at other girls

467
00:28:07,825 --> 00:28:10,259
"in the changing rooms
before gym

468
00:28:10,261 --> 00:28:11,927
"and in the showers.

469
00:28:11,929 --> 00:28:15,164
"My biggest sin is one
that I am also thankful for,

470
00:28:15,166 --> 00:28:19,002
because it has led me
to Love in Action."

471
00:28:19,004 --> 00:28:21,674
Doing well, Sarah. Carry on.

472
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:27,279
"I had run away
from my uncle's house

473
00:28:27,281 --> 00:28:29,614
"and stayed
with some girls I knew

474
00:28:29,616 --> 00:28:31,950
"whose parents were away.

475
00:28:31,952 --> 00:28:33,952
"It was there
that I finally acted

476
00:28:33,954 --> 00:28:36,724
on my homosexual thoughts."

477
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,127
Come on, Sarah.

478
00:28:41,129 --> 00:28:43,796
"I let a girl touch my...

479
00:28:43,798 --> 00:28:45,532
"kiss m-my...

480
00:28:47,069 --> 00:28:50,003
...my vagina..."

481
00:28:50,005 --> 00:28:52,140
Nobody's judging. Come on.

482
00:28:52,142 --> 00:28:55,376
"...and put
her fingers inside me,

483
00:28:55,378 --> 00:28:58,179
"and I did the same.

484
00:28:58,181 --> 00:29:01,082
"I renounce these
sinful thoughts and actions,

485
00:29:01,084 --> 00:29:04,989
and ask God to forgive me
all these things."

486
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:07,990
Very good.

487
00:29:07,992 --> 00:29:09,892
We love you, Sarah.

488
00:29:09,894 --> 00:29:12,495
All right, repeat after me.
We love you, Sarah.

489
00:29:12,497 --> 00:29:14,665
We love you, Sarah.

490
00:29:14,667 --> 00:29:16,336
Very good.

491
00:29:35,557 --> 00:29:37,557
Do you want some water?

492
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:40,562
I'm fine, thanks.

493
00:29:40,564 --> 00:29:45,265
- Can I get you anything else?
- I'm... I'm fine, thank you.

494
00:29:45,267 --> 00:29:48,403
How dare you
humiliate a child like that?!

495
00:29:48,405 --> 00:29:51,039
Is that what you guys...
you like that?

496
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:52,541
Do you like doing that?!

497
00:29:52,543 --> 00:29:54,543
You like humiliating
and abusing children?!

498
00:29:54,545 --> 00:29:57,613
- It's not easy...
- What do you mean it's not easy?!

499
00:29:57,615 --> 00:29:59,548
- Lee's parents.
- His parents are here.

500
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:01,718
- Listen to yourself!
- With respect,

501
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,422
- we are not running a holiday camp here.
- We paid you $3,000.

502
00:30:05,424 --> 00:30:07,991
I should report you. You could
have given him a concussion!

503
00:30:07,993 --> 00:30:09,293
David, let's go.

504
00:30:09,295 --> 00:30:11,462
That change doesn't come easy.

505
00:30:11,464 --> 00:30:13,464
Unbelievable!

506
00:30:26,013 --> 00:30:28,416
<i>Y'all find the reason</i>

507
00:30:28,418 --> 00:30:30,751
y'all are here is funny?

508
00:30:30,753 --> 00:30:32,586
Look at y'all!

509
00:30:32,588 --> 00:30:34,588
People!

510
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,690
I'm trying to help you.

511
00:30:36,692 --> 00:30:38,427
So do not waste my time.

512
00:30:38,429 --> 00:30:41,663
Nobody is to discuss the
therapy outside these walls!

513
00:30:41,665 --> 00:30:43,532
Do I make myself clear?!

514
00:31:35,325 --> 00:31:37,826
Yo, I got your back. Whoa!

515
00:31:37,828 --> 00:31:39,329
- Oh, sorry, sorry.
- I got that.

516
00:31:39,331 --> 00:31:40,763
Thank you so much.

517
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:43,399
Which, uh, which room you in?

518
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,702
I'm in, uh, 317.

519
00:31:45,704 --> 00:31:47,403
Oh, I'm in 237.

520
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,839
You run?

521
00:31:48,841 --> 00:31:50,174
- Yeah.
- I figure.

522
00:31:50,176 --> 00:31:52,042
People who run
know about ASICS, right?

523
00:31:52,044 --> 00:31:53,678
Oh, yeah.

524
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,414
Here, this is me.

525
00:32:04,526 --> 00:32:07,760
First one in gets to choose.

526
00:32:10,866 --> 00:32:12,900
You got a girl?

527
00:32:12,902 --> 00:32:14,903
If so, you might want to think

528
00:32:14,905 --> 00:32:17,572
about applying for a room
without bunks.

529
00:32:17,574 --> 00:32:19,641
Just broke up.

530
00:32:19,643 --> 00:32:22,710
Oh. That's perfect timing.

531
00:32:22,712 --> 00:32:25,380
Before college.

532
00:32:25,382 --> 00:32:27,583
We're a good fit.

533
00:32:27,585 --> 00:32:29,385
Hate running with slowpokes.

534
00:32:29,387 --> 00:32:32,388
I'll tell you what,
I'll race you on the way back.

535
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:35,391
Last one back has to go
to the other one's church.

536
00:32:35,393 --> 00:32:37,560
Why? What kind of church is it?

537
00:32:37,562 --> 00:32:39,429
You game or not?

538
00:32:39,431 --> 00:32:41,999
- All right.
- All right, one,

539
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,968
- two, three, go!
- Two, three, go!

540
00:33:07,296 --> 00:33:10,798
- Ben. This is Jared.
- Hey, man, nice to meet you.

541
00:33:57,252 --> 00:34:00,087
Did you say your roommate's
not back till tomorrow?

542
00:34:00,089 --> 00:34:02,158
He's on some golf trip.

543
00:34:05,829 --> 00:34:07,598
Do you want to crash?

544
00:34:09,933 --> 00:34:12,168
Maybe.

545
00:34:31,024 --> 00:34:32,624
Night.

546
00:34:32,626 --> 00:34:34,628
Good night.

547
00:35:25,918 --> 00:35:28,255
Can't sleep, huh?

548
00:35:42,605 --> 00:35:45,541
Probably shouldn't run
so late at night.

549
00:36:03,962 --> 00:36:06,198
Are you okay?

550
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:09,735
Yeah.

551
00:36:11,737 --> 00:36:13,739
Yeah, just...

552
00:37:07,033 --> 00:37:09,033
It's okay.

553
00:37:26,622 --> 00:37:31,158
Hey. It's okay. It's okay.

554
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:34,262
- Wait, wait.
- Shh, shh, shh.

555
00:37:34,264 --> 00:37:36,831
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

556
00:37:36,833 --> 00:37:39,235
Shh.

557
00:37:39,237 --> 00:37:41,403
- Shh.
- Stop, stop, stop.

558
00:37:41,405 --> 00:37:43,973
Stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop!

559
00:37:55,655 --> 00:37:57,523
Ow!

560
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:04,796
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

561
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,267
Ow! Ow!

562
00:38:27,959 --> 00:38:29,693
Oh.

563
00:38:45,577 --> 00:38:48,914
What the hell is wrong with me?

564
00:38:50,918 --> 00:38:52,920
I'm so sorry.

565
00:38:57,490 --> 00:38:59,925
I'm gonna be
in so much trouble.

566
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:09,071
I need to confess.

567
00:39:14,444 --> 00:39:17,714
I need to confess.
Will you hear me?

568
00:39:20,183 --> 00:39:22,919
- Please.
- Uh-huh.

569
00:39:28,293 --> 00:39:31,529
Do you remember
the kid from church?

570
00:39:33,865 --> 00:39:36,402
The one in front of us.

571
00:39:39,773 --> 00:39:43,374
Something happened
with me and him.

572
00:39:43,376 --> 00:39:46,480
Something pretty bad.

573
00:39:51,752 --> 00:39:55,754
You wouldn't dare tell anyone,
would you?

574
00:39:55,756 --> 00:39:57,893
Please.

575
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:02,564
Keep it between us.

576
00:40:25,123 --> 00:40:28,928
Start with chapter six, please.

577
00:41:30,663 --> 00:41:33,398
What-what a surprise.

578
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,033
Oh!

579
00:41:53,456 --> 00:41:55,690
- Hello.
- Is this Mrs. Nancy Eamons?

580
00:41:55,692 --> 00:41:57,125
This is she.

581
00:41:57,127 --> 00:41:59,060
I'm a counselor
at Danton College.

582
00:41:59,062 --> 00:42:02,064
And I'm afraid I have
some disturbing news

583
00:42:02,066 --> 00:42:04,200
about your son's behavior
at school.

584
00:42:04,202 --> 00:42:05,368
What?

585
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:07,970
What about him?

586
00:42:07,972 --> 00:42:09,606
- Did he give you a name?
- I need you to answer

587
00:42:09,608 --> 00:42:10,941
- my question.
- If-if he gave you a name...

588
00:42:10,943 --> 00:42:11,975
- Please, Jared, just answer me.
- I'm just saying...

589
00:42:11,977 --> 00:42:13,376
Have you been doing
the things he says?

590
00:42:13,378 --> 00:42:15,379
- Why wouldn't he give you a name?
- Come on, son, enough.

591
00:42:15,381 --> 00:42:17,882
- Tell me the truth.
- I'm asking the questions, too.

592
00:42:17,884 --> 00:42:20,218
He didn't, um,
give me a name. I don't...

593
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:22,220
The guy's full of shit.
He's telling a bunch of lies.

594
00:42:22,222 --> 00:42:23,455
Now you will not talk
like that in this house

595
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:24,922
in front of your mother.
You just watch your mouth.

596
00:42:24,924 --> 00:42:26,925
Nancy, if-if you could
just give us a moment,

597
00:42:26,927 --> 00:42:28,894
- you know, just to...
- I'm-I'm leaving.

598
00:42:28,896 --> 00:42:30,829
- I'm-I'm...
- Sit down. You will not leave the room.

599
00:42:30,831 --> 00:42:32,298
You will sit down, boy.

600
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,067
- You will sit down.
- It's bullshit, Dad.

601
00:42:34,069 --> 00:42:37,571
- It's bullshit.
- I just asked you to watch your mouth!

602
00:42:37,573 --> 00:42:42,644
I think, um,
he said he was a counselor.

603
00:42:42,646 --> 00:42:44,745
And then...
and I asked for his name,

604
00:42:44,747 --> 00:42:46,080
- and then I asked for...
- Nancy.

605
00:42:46,082 --> 00:42:48,115
- You see?
- ...his number and he didn't...

606
00:42:48,117 --> 00:42:49,251
Nancy, please.

607
00:42:49,253 --> 00:42:51,254
Dad, I-I...

608
00:42:51,256 --> 00:42:53,422
He's made all of this up.

609
00:42:53,424 --> 00:42:56,492
Let's just sit here.
We're just gonna talk calmly.

610
00:42:56,494 --> 00:42:58,794
All right. All right.

611
00:42:58,796 --> 00:43:00,630
No, Dad.

612
00:43:00,632 --> 00:43:02,835
Jared.

613
00:43:05,304 --> 00:43:08,305
I just need you to tell me
the truth, that's all.

614
00:43:08,307 --> 00:43:12,976
What this man says of you...
Jared.

615
00:43:12,978 --> 00:43:16,150
Are you a homosexual?

616
00:43:20,454 --> 00:43:23,355
Jared. We are not finished!

617
00:43:23,357 --> 00:43:26,126
- I am, because you won't listen!
- Honey. Honey.

618
00:43:26,128 --> 00:43:28,328
What this man says,
is it true?

619
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:29,229
What this full-of-shit guy,

620
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:31,231
- who is not a counselor...
- Answer me!

621
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:35,236
...who raped a kid
at-at his own church,

622
00:43:35,238 --> 00:43:37,506
and God knows who else!

623
00:43:37,508 --> 00:43:40,142
- Dad, you're hurting me.
- Marshall.

624
00:43:40,144 --> 00:43:42,577
His name is Henry Wallace.
He's-he's not a counselor.

625
00:43:42,579 --> 00:43:44,346
- He's a student.
- All right.

626
00:43:44,348 --> 00:43:47,816
And-and... he told me
he did some bad things.

627
00:43:47,818 --> 00:43:51,321
I think he thinks
I'm gonna tell on him.

628
00:43:51,323 --> 00:43:53,524
Honey.

629
00:43:53,526 --> 00:43:55,695
Son.

630
00:44:07,674 --> 00:44:09,441
Fight!

631
00:44:18,687 --> 00:44:20,855
Go to war!

632
00:44:31,534 --> 00:44:33,937
Your mother's making dinner.

633
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:38,909
I'm okay, I'm not hungry.

634
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:46,149
I want you to write down
this man's name,

635
00:44:46,151 --> 00:44:49,821
his church,
phone number if you have it.

636
00:44:49,823 --> 00:44:51,823
Any information at all.

637
00:44:51,825 --> 00:44:53,792
I don't want you
to talk to him.

638
00:44:53,794 --> 00:44:55,126
I ain't gonna talk to him.

639
00:44:55,128 --> 00:44:57,128
If he's been doing
what you say,

640
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:59,767
then he needs to be reported.

641
00:45:02,737 --> 00:45:04,903
Okay.

642
00:45:04,905 --> 00:45:06,672
Now, you know what I did?

643
00:45:06,674 --> 00:45:09,142
I invited Chloe and her parents
for lunch tomorrow.

644
00:45:09,144 --> 00:45:12,145
And I was thinking it'd be fun
if you could join in.

645
00:45:12,147 --> 00:45:16,116
Missing one more day of class
ain't gonna end the world.

646
00:45:16,118 --> 00:45:18,520
You know, Jared...

647
00:45:18,522 --> 00:45:21,823
...far as I can tell,

648
00:45:21,825 --> 00:45:24,426
we've only got
one God-given right,

649
00:45:24,428 --> 00:45:28,364
and that is when a man
and a woman come together,

650
00:45:28,366 --> 00:45:32,168
they may create life.

651
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:35,171
You think how much God
must love mankind

652
00:45:35,173 --> 00:45:37,373
to give us that
awesome responsibility.

653
00:45:37,375 --> 00:45:39,376
Dad.

654
00:45:39,378 --> 00:45:42,449
It's really not true.

655
00:45:48,188 --> 00:45:52,191
You know what I think about
these type of games, too.

656
00:45:52,193 --> 00:45:55,828
Be respectful to your mother
when she calls.

657
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:58,499
You come down and eat.

658
00:46:32,103 --> 00:46:34,938
- Honey.
- All right.

659
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:36,874
You want me to stop
with the games?

660
00:46:36,876 --> 00:46:38,576
I'll stop with them.

661
00:46:38,578 --> 00:46:40,445
I broke up with Chloe.

662
00:46:40,447 --> 00:46:43,049
Because...

663
00:46:48,221 --> 00:46:53,194
We broke up because
I think it's true, about me.

664
00:46:55,029 --> 00:46:57,099
God help me.

665
00:46:58,867 --> 00:47:01,604
I think about men.

666
00:47:13,752 --> 00:47:16,488
I don't know why.

667
00:47:18,823 --> 00:47:21,493
I'm so sorry.

668
00:48:11,984 --> 00:48:13,718
God bless you, Pastor.

669
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,019
Thank you, guys, for coming.

670
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:24,127
I've had better days,
I can tell you that.

671
00:48:30,638 --> 00:48:33,472
Just a minute. Just a minute.

672
00:48:33,474 --> 00:48:36,009
- Mom?
- Hold on.

673
00:48:36,011 --> 00:48:38,045
All right.

674
00:48:41,383 --> 00:48:46,487
Wh... Why are Pastor Wilkes
and Jim Picard here?

675
00:48:46,489 --> 00:48:50,394
Pastor Wilkes has dealt with
this kind of thing before.

676
00:48:51,996 --> 00:48:57,733
Jim has a son, Eddie, who, um...
y-you were a little boy, but...

677
00:48:57,735 --> 00:48:59,702
Anyway.

678
00:48:59,704 --> 00:49:01,237
What'd they do to him?

679
00:49:01,239 --> 00:49:04,273
Oh, no. You silly thing.

680
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:06,275
They didn't do anything to him.

681
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:11,415
They did things for him,
all right?

682
00:49:11,417 --> 00:49:14,852
Just like they're gonna
do things for you.

683
00:49:14,854 --> 00:49:18,023
Your father's wondering...

684
00:49:18,025 --> 00:49:20,627
he's wondering how to help.

685
00:49:23,064 --> 00:49:24,930
Come here.

686
00:49:24,932 --> 00:49:27,467
It's all gonna be all right.

687
00:49:29,738 --> 00:49:32,372
We've got one question
for you, son.

688
00:49:32,374 --> 00:49:34,040
And then we're gonna
let you sleep.

689
00:49:34,042 --> 00:49:37,478
It's been a big day.

690
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:41,649
I have shared our conversations

691
00:49:41,651 --> 00:49:43,652
with these two
fine upstanding men,

692
00:49:43,654 --> 00:49:46,456
and I have asked them
for their guidance.

693
00:49:48,257 --> 00:49:50,126
I can tell you right now,

694
00:49:50,128 --> 00:49:51,794
we don't have all the answers.

695
00:49:51,796 --> 00:49:57,067
But I do know that you gonna
hold the key to the next step.

696
00:49:57,069 --> 00:50:01,338
Your mother and I,
we cannot see

697
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:04,241
a way that you can live
under this roof,

698
00:50:04,243 --> 00:50:07,579
attend service
and work at the dealership

699
00:50:07,581 --> 00:50:09,581
if you're gonna fundamentally

700
00:50:09,583 --> 00:50:12,917
go against the grain
of our beliefs.

701
00:50:12,919 --> 00:50:15,454
And against God himself.

702
00:50:15,456 --> 00:50:19,794
I'm gonna ask you
that question now, son.

703
00:50:23,297 --> 00:50:25,601
In your heart...

704
00:50:28,104 --> 00:50:30,840
...do you want to change?

705
00:50:50,897 --> 00:50:53,396
Yes.

706
00:50:53,398 --> 00:50:55,835
Yes, I want to change.

707
00:50:59,405 --> 00:51:01,640
Come a little closer, son.

708
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:04,543
Pastor Wilkes,

709
00:51:04,545 --> 00:51:08,747
could you ask Jesus
to shine his light

710
00:51:08,749 --> 00:51:12,484
on my boy at this time?

711
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:15,989
Heavenly Father, I ask
your blessing for this family.

712
00:51:15,991 --> 00:51:17,658
Give them strength.

713
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:23,330
Unleash your power
for one of your flock, Jared,

714
00:51:23,332 --> 00:51:25,433
who has lost his way.

715
00:51:25,435 --> 00:51:28,938
We pray, Lord,
that you make him pure

716
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:32,208
and that you return him
safely back to us

717
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:34,542
and see that the errors
of his way

718
00:51:34,544 --> 00:51:38,715
are nothing more than
a momentary straying.

719
00:51:38,717 --> 00:51:41,518
We pray that he see
the path of faith

720
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:45,755
<i>and that he strive to be honest</i>

721
00:51:45,757 --> 00:51:49,962
<i>and that he then find the joy
of a new life.</i>

722
00:51:49,964 --> 00:51:52,064
<i>In his name we pray.</i>

723
00:51:52,066 --> 00:51:53,764
<i>Amen.</i>

724
00:51:53,766 --> 00:51:55,468
Jared.

725
00:52:00,541 --> 00:52:02,809
How's college treating you?

726
00:52:02,811 --> 00:52:05,211
Ah, it's going good. Yeah.

727
00:52:05,213 --> 00:52:07,947
- It's good.
- Your father's asked me

728
00:52:07,949 --> 00:52:10,253
to take some of your blood.

729
00:52:13,056 --> 00:52:17,393
He wants me to... to check
for testosterone levels.

730
00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:23,465
I'm in a bit of
a bind here, Jared,

731
00:52:23,467 --> 00:52:25,768
and I-I said this
to your mother, too.

732
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:29,906
Now, I am a religious woman,
there's-there's no-no question,

733
00:52:29,908 --> 00:52:32,942
but I have also been
to medical school,

734
00:52:32,944 --> 00:52:37,447
and... well, you could say that
I hold science in one hand

735
00:52:37,449 --> 00:52:40,251
and God in the other,
and that is not always

736
00:52:40,253 --> 00:52:42,687
an easy balance.

737
00:52:42,689 --> 00:52:46,491
And I know that everybody would
like for me to say otherwise

738
00:52:46,493 --> 00:52:50,095
and send you down
to the pharmacy for a-a pill

739
00:52:50,097 --> 00:52:53,999
that would magically fix you,
but that's not gonna happen.

740
00:52:54,001 --> 00:52:56,269
But I'm gonna take your blood,
and I know,

741
00:52:56,271 --> 00:52:58,271
I know what it's gonna show me.

742
00:52:58,273 --> 00:53:00,606
That you are
a perfectly normal,

743
00:53:00,608 --> 00:53:03,010
very healthy teenage boy.

744
00:53:03,012 --> 00:53:06,347
Jared, it's-it's not my place

745
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:09,283
to tell you
that your parents are wrong,

746
00:53:09,285 --> 00:53:12,687
but let's say
that they are wrong.

747
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,690
I understand
your father signed you up

748
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:17,626
for a program next month.

749
00:53:17,628 --> 00:53:23,866
Whatever happens next,
it is still your choice.

750
00:53:23,868 --> 00:53:27,972
It may not feel that way,
but it is.

751
00:53:27,974 --> 00:53:29,974
You're 18.

752
00:53:29,976 --> 00:53:34,478
Do you have anything
that you'd...

753
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:38,016
you'd like to say to me?

754
00:53:38,018 --> 00:53:41,655
Any-any questions?

755
00:53:44,758 --> 00:53:46,660
No.

756
00:53:50,332 --> 00:53:52,432
Jared?

757
00:53:52,434 --> 00:53:54,370
Morning.

758
00:54:05,449 --> 00:54:11,186
So... I wanted to talk to you
about these.

759
00:54:11,188 --> 00:54:13,189
Uh, your writing?

760
00:54:13,191 --> 00:54:18,362
This, uh,
"Remy and Lucy met at midnight

761
00:54:18,364 --> 00:54:22,966
under the stars
on Willow Street."

762
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:26,704
What-what...
tell me about these.

763
00:54:26,706 --> 00:54:29,910
Well, it's-it's just,
it's-it's a story.

764
00:54:31,712 --> 00:54:35,080
It's a love story about
a boy and a girl, correct?

765
00:54:35,082 --> 00:54:36,715
- Yeah.
- But were you

766
00:54:36,717 --> 00:54:41,120
thinking about two boys
when you wrote this?

767
00:54:41,122 --> 00:54:42,655
No.

768
00:54:42,657 --> 00:54:44,557
I mean, be honest.

769
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:47,760
No. It's just a story.

770
00:54:47,762 --> 00:54:50,733
It's just an assignment
for college.

771
00:54:52,568 --> 00:54:54,903
Jared, I've seen your
reading list for college.

772
00:54:54,905 --> 00:54:56,838
I have it here, and listen,

773
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:59,441
<i>The Picture of Dorian Gray,
Lolita,</i>

774
00:54:59,443 --> 00:55:01,911
I-I mean, some of
th-these books, Jared,

775
00:55:01,913 --> 00:55:03,846
considering everything that's
going on for you right now,

776
00:55:03,848 --> 00:55:05,915
I don't know that college
is really the best thing

777
00:55:05,917 --> 00:55:08,087
for you to be pursuing at all.

778
00:55:09,088 --> 00:55:10,753
A year with us may be

779
00:55:10,755 --> 00:55:13,759
a much, much better use
of your time.

780
00:55:15,594 --> 00:55:19,430
Given everything that I see.

781
00:55:19,432 --> 00:55:22,436
And everything that's at stake.

782
00:55:24,003 --> 00:55:28,607
And I'm willing to say that
to your parents.

783
00:55:28,609 --> 00:55:30,943
Listen, I've had many
wonderful conversations

784
00:55:30,945 --> 00:55:32,611
with your parents...
lovely people.

785
00:55:32,613 --> 00:55:35,515
So, I know some of the story,

786
00:55:35,517 --> 00:55:39,186
and I know that there is
quite a discrepancy

787
00:55:39,188 --> 00:55:43,824
between what they were told
and what you said.

788
00:55:43,826 --> 00:55:46,727
And you got to understand that

789
00:55:46,729 --> 00:55:48,696
they don't know
what to believe,

790
00:55:48,698 --> 00:55:51,633
and that's very troubling
for them.

791
00:55:51,635 --> 00:55:54,836
But I think that you and I know

792
00:55:54,838 --> 00:55:57,907
that there is a whole lot more
to the story,

793
00:55:57,909 --> 00:56:02,548
and, you know, we're not here
on mere thoughts alone.

794
00:56:05,985 --> 00:56:09,153
Jared, the-the people who get
the most out of this place

795
00:56:09,155 --> 00:56:13,425
are the people that are just
really brave and-and honest

796
00:56:13,427 --> 00:56:17,096
and-and lay everything on
the table, ugly as it seems,

797
00:56:17,098 --> 00:56:20,234
and-and fess up
to what God already sees.

798
00:56:22,403 --> 00:56:25,405
And then I can
really truly assess

799
00:56:25,407 --> 00:56:27,943
what is the best future
for you.

800
00:56:30,946 --> 00:56:32,948
Okay, son?

801
00:56:35,418 --> 00:56:39,288
Yeah. Yeah.

802
00:56:40,624 --> 00:56:43,258
<i>Dear Heavenly Father,</i>

803
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:46,962
<i>today I ask your forgiveness
for my sins.</i>

804
00:56:46,964 --> 00:56:49,533
<i>For a year, we lived together
under the cover</i>

805
00:56:49,535 --> 00:56:50,869
<i>of being roommates.</i>

806
00:56:51,703 --> 00:56:54,103
But in reality, the whole time,

807
00:56:54,105 --> 00:56:56,940
I was committing
the sin of sodomy.

808
00:56:56,942 --> 00:56:58,875
And then my family
discovered the truth

809
00:56:58,877 --> 00:57:00,811
and brought me back
to my senses.

810
00:57:00,813 --> 00:57:04,149
They helped me realize
that I was fooling myself.

811
00:57:04,151 --> 00:57:07,719
That I was being fooled.

812
00:57:07,721 --> 00:57:09,955
That I was seduced
into a life of sin

813
00:57:09,957 --> 00:57:11,890
by all sorts of sinful people.

814
00:57:11,892 --> 00:57:14,060
And I knew in my heart

815
00:57:14,062 --> 00:57:16,597
that I had forsaken Jesus
for Satan.

816
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:18,231
But now...

817
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:23,503
...I am awake to my sins.

818
00:57:23,505 --> 00:57:25,473
I'm enlightened.

819
00:57:25,475 --> 00:57:27,575
I'm here with all of you.

820
00:57:27,577 --> 00:57:31,948
And I am disgusted at
the person that I once was.

821
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:37,786
I want to ask God
for his forgiveness,

822
00:57:37,788 --> 00:57:40,290
and I want to thank
all of you guys,

823
00:57:40,292 --> 00:57:41,857
especially you, Mr. Sykes,

824
00:57:41,859 --> 00:57:45,428
for helping me get back
on the path to righteousness.

825
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:47,497
We love you, Gary.

826
00:57:47,499 --> 00:57:50,434
We love you, Gary.

827
00:58:03,851 --> 00:58:07,220
Please don't do that, honey.
You know I don't...

828
00:58:07,222 --> 00:58:10,223
Mom, who did that happen to
and when? Seriously.

829
00:58:10,225 --> 00:58:11,790
Do you know?

830
00:58:11,792 --> 00:58:13,827
Do you actually know
who that happened to?

831
00:58:16,733 --> 00:58:20,968
It never happened.

832
00:58:23,039 --> 00:58:25,807
Parents want to
protect their kids.

833
00:58:25,809 --> 00:58:27,543
So they feed them lies.

834
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:29,145
I think that they're okay lies.

835
00:58:29,147 --> 00:58:33,549
What? Like not telling me
how long I might be here for?

836
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:37,054
You know, the whole thing
you and Dad are paying for here

837
00:58:37,056 --> 00:58:40,357
is all about how messed up
we are by our parents.

838
00:58:40,359 --> 00:58:41,391
They want to know about you.

839
00:58:41,393 --> 00:58:43,393
That's why you can't know
all about it,

840
00:58:43,395 --> 00:58:45,829
'cause then they wouldn't
get their money out of you.

841
00:58:45,831 --> 00:58:49,000
What have I ever
done to you? Hmm?

842
00:58:49,002 --> 00:58:53,038
Talk about me all you want.
My conscience is clean.

843
00:59:00,581 --> 00:59:03,784
Honey.

844
00:59:20,871 --> 00:59:24,272
I'm gonna go for a run.
Is that okay, Mom?

845
00:59:24,274 --> 00:59:26,044
Mm-hmm.

846
01:00:21,873 --> 01:00:23,375
Fuck you!

847
01:00:26,512 --> 01:00:28,512
Fuck you!

848
01:00:36,122 --> 01:00:37,989
Fuck you!

849
01:00:41,995 --> 01:00:43,962
Please, please
give me strength.

850
01:00:43,964 --> 01:00:46,332
I need your help.

851
01:00:46,334 --> 01:00:49,405
Amen.

852
01:01:04,822 --> 01:01:08,324
I'm reading it. No debate.

853
01:01:08,326 --> 01:01:10,827
I have a right to know
what they're teaching you.

854
01:01:10,829 --> 01:01:12,696
I don't see why anyone
would read it

855
01:01:12,698 --> 01:01:14,331
unless you absolutely had to.

856
01:01:14,333 --> 01:01:17,033
I need to know what's inside.

857
01:01:17,035 --> 01:01:20,270
There are tons of
spelling errors in it.

858
01:01:20,272 --> 01:01:23,574
I almost want to mark up
a copy for them.

859
01:01:23,576 --> 01:01:25,878
But that would take away
the only real enjoyment

860
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:27,613
you get from reading it,

861
01:01:27,615 --> 01:01:33,254
'cause I guess it's... actually
not much fun to be there.

862
01:01:36,123 --> 01:01:37,925
And I'm starting to wonder

863
01:01:37,927 --> 01:01:40,426
whether it's really
gonna change me.

864
01:02:01,052 --> 01:02:06,291
"We always come back
to Dog's true design."

865
01:02:11,897 --> 01:02:14,501
Almighty Dog.

866
01:02:46,537 --> 01:02:49,005
Welcome to God Versus Science.

867
01:02:53,210 --> 01:02:55,112
Thank you.

868
01:02:59,952 --> 01:03:01,619
Look up there...

869
01:03:01,621 --> 01:03:04,457
Welcome to this exhibit.

870
01:03:38,062 --> 01:03:40,663
<i>Where are you from, Xavier?</i>

871
01:03:40,665 --> 01:03:43,198
I was born in Vienna.

872
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:48,203
I ended up in Canada,
and now I'm here.

873
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:57,915
Do you believe in God?

874
01:03:57,917 --> 01:04:01,420
I do, yeah.

875
01:04:01,422 --> 01:04:03,755
Wow.

876
01:04:03,757 --> 01:04:08,195
I question it, but I still
believe in God, yeah.

877
01:04:15,137 --> 01:04:18,539
Who created the Earth?

878
01:04:18,541 --> 01:04:20,710
You like a little
small talk, huh?

879
01:04:22,812 --> 01:04:25,480
Do you believe in the Devil?

880
01:04:28,986 --> 01:04:31,755
Does he look like me?

881
01:04:32,924 --> 01:04:34,726
I don't know.

882
01:04:50,944 --> 01:04:53,511
Do you know Job from the Bible?

883
01:04:53,513 --> 01:04:56,414
Not personally.

884
01:04:56,416 --> 01:04:59,785
I hear he's not great company,
always complaining.

885
01:05:03,759 --> 01:05:05,759
I-I imagine I'm him sometimes.

886
01:05:05,761 --> 01:05:10,330
And that God and the Devil
are having a bet over me.

887
01:05:10,332 --> 01:05:12,800
That one day
God will let-let me in

888
01:05:12,802 --> 01:05:16,807
on the experiment
he was having to test me.

889
01:05:18,842 --> 01:05:21,544
I think we're our own God.

890
01:05:23,346 --> 01:05:26,549
I mean, I think he's in us.

891
01:05:26,551 --> 01:05:33,225
In all of us, not... you know,
somewhere hiding and watching.

892
01:05:44,871 --> 01:05:47,739
Stay with me.

893
01:05:47,741 --> 01:05:50,876
Nothing needs to happen.

894
01:05:50,878 --> 01:05:52,880
I swear.

895
01:05:55,650 --> 01:05:59,085
I'll prove to you
that God won't strike you down.

896
01:06:35,862 --> 01:06:38,197
You wronged me, Dad, and I...

897
01:06:38,199 --> 01:06:41,033
- and I hate the way that...
- Louder, Cameron.

898
01:06:41,035 --> 01:06:42,534
Can't hear you.

899
01:06:42,536 --> 01:06:46,038
Come on. I'll bring him closer.
There he is.

900
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:47,606
You wronged me, Dad,

901
01:06:47,608 --> 01:06:50,376
and I hate you for the way
that you, that you treated me

902
01:06:50,378 --> 01:06:52,246
since you found out
about my problems.

903
01:06:52,248 --> 01:06:55,415
No, about your sin. Say that.

904
01:06:55,417 --> 01:06:58,652
"About my sins." Go!

905
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:05,363
"About my sins."
Come on, Cameron.

906
01:07:07,497 --> 01:07:12,235
"My homosexual sins."
Come on, Cameron!

907
01:07:12,237 --> 01:07:14,503
- Cameron!
- I can go.

908
01:07:14,505 --> 01:07:16,573
- I don't, I don't mind...
- No, no, no, no.

909
01:07:16,575 --> 01:07:19,242
Jared, everybody gets a turn.
This is Cameron's turn.

910
01:07:19,244 --> 01:07:21,411
"About my sins!" Come on!

911
01:07:21,413 --> 01:07:23,613
Found out about my sins.

912
01:07:23,615 --> 01:07:27,685
I hate that you never listen
to me or acknowledge me.

913
01:07:27,687 --> 01:07:29,420
And when you do acknowledge me,

914
01:07:29,422 --> 01:07:31,522
it's to make fun of me
in front of my friends.

915
01:07:31,524 --> 01:07:33,759
"It's to make fun of me."

916
01:07:33,761 --> 01:07:35,928
To make fun of me
in front of my friends.

917
01:07:35,930 --> 01:07:38,665
And that, and that time
that you told me

918
01:07:38,667 --> 01:07:40,867
that you wished
I'd never been born?

919
01:07:40,869 --> 01:07:43,438
That really hurt me.

920
01:07:48,278 --> 01:07:51,046
Cameron...

921
01:07:51,048 --> 01:07:54,115
now, you say that you're angry,

922
01:07:54,117 --> 01:07:59,521
but, quite frankly,
I don't really see it.

923
01:07:59,523 --> 01:08:01,991
Well, what's going on
in there, Cameron?

924
01:08:01,993 --> 01:08:04,060
Huh?

925
01:08:04,062 --> 01:08:06,062
Do you want to change?

926
01:08:06,064 --> 01:08:09,065
Now, you're gonna wish
you hadn't have been born, son,

927
01:08:09,067 --> 01:08:14,671
because God will not love you
the way that you are right now.

928
01:08:14,673 --> 01:08:18,009
Unless you really
want to change.

929
01:08:18,011 --> 01:08:20,680
Well? Come on.

930
01:08:28,155 --> 01:08:30,022
Well, I guess not.

931
01:08:30,024 --> 01:08:31,657
I guess not. Okay.

932
01:08:31,659 --> 01:08:34,827
Let's take a break.

933
01:08:34,829 --> 01:08:38,332
And you are gonna stay here
until you're ready to go!

934
01:08:38,334 --> 01:08:42,203
Everybody but Cameron,
take a break.

935
01:08:45,608 --> 01:08:48,846
I don't care
if you sit there all day, son.

936
01:09:07,467 --> 01:09:09,467
<i>Is this all a game to you?</i>

937
01:09:09,469 --> 01:09:11,371
<i>What do you mean?</i>

938
01:09:12,373 --> 01:09:14,139
Listen, man.

939
01:09:14,141 --> 01:09:16,208
You got to think about
why you went there.

940
01:09:16,210 --> 01:09:19,711
You're trying to bail him out?
Seriously?

941
01:09:19,713 --> 01:09:21,546
And touching him like that?

942
01:09:21,548 --> 01:09:23,715
Do you think no one saw?

943
01:09:23,717 --> 01:09:26,653
You saw him.
He was very upset.

944
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:29,823
- I didn't mean anything by it.
- I should report you.

945
01:09:29,825 --> 01:09:32,893
True ownership, man. Okay?

946
01:09:32,895 --> 01:09:35,996
This is what moral inventory
is all about.

947
01:09:35,998 --> 01:09:39,600
And you got to quit
staring at me all the time.

948
01:09:39,602 --> 01:09:42,304
These are the urges
that we got to stamp out.

949
01:09:42,306 --> 01:09:45,941
Okay? You got to control this.

950
01:09:45,943 --> 01:09:48,912
- Do you even want this to work?
- Of course I do.

951
01:09:48,914 --> 01:09:50,847
We're all trying
to make this work.

952
01:09:50,849 --> 01:09:53,517
I'm having a tough time, too,
just like you are.

953
01:09:53,519 --> 01:09:55,519
Listen, I'm fine.

954
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:05,532
Doesn't seem like it.

955
01:10:27,656 --> 01:10:29,491
Hey, what are you
doing in here alone?

956
01:10:29,493 --> 01:10:32,628
You're meant to attend bathroom
breaks with a staff member.

957
01:10:37,969 --> 01:10:40,638
What?
Now you don't have to pee?

958
01:10:44,809 --> 01:10:47,012
Or are you gonna do
something solo?

959
01:10:48,647 --> 01:10:51,151
That's why
they make them rules.

960
01:10:53,652 --> 01:10:56,320
Not to be trusted.

961
01:10:56,322 --> 01:10:58,825
Not at this stage of the game.

962
01:11:02,163 --> 01:11:04,364
Hmm.

963
01:11:04,366 --> 01:11:07,500
Sounds like Morse code.

964
01:11:07,502 --> 01:11:10,270
Sending me a message...

965
01:11:10,272 --> 01:11:12,339
faggot?

966
01:11:58,659 --> 01:12:01,563
Starting to see it
for what it is?

967
01:12:07,403 --> 01:12:09,403
Are you okay?

968
01:12:09,405 --> 01:12:13,475
I'm fine. I'm fine.

969
01:12:13,477 --> 01:12:16,146
I'm gonna give you some advice.

970
01:12:19,316 --> 01:12:21,683
Play the part.

971
01:12:21,685 --> 01:12:24,754
Show 'em it's working.

972
01:12:24,756 --> 01:12:26,958
You're getting better.

973
01:12:29,528 --> 01:12:32,929
Fake it until you make it,
right?

974
01:12:32,931 --> 01:12:34,764
You don't want to end up

975
01:12:34,766 --> 01:12:38,670
in one of those houses
for any length of time.

976
01:12:38,672 --> 01:12:41,306
I've heard the stories,
and they're not good.

977
01:12:41,308 --> 01:12:44,676
And that's where
you're likely gonna end up.

978
01:12:44,678 --> 01:12:47,279
Sarah's already there.

979
01:12:47,281 --> 01:12:49,784
So, play the part, man.

980
01:12:51,620 --> 01:12:53,720
And then, once you're home,

981
01:12:53,722 --> 01:12:56,456
you got to figure out
what to do next.

982
01:12:56,458 --> 01:12:58,791
If it comes down to it,

983
01:12:58,793 --> 01:13:01,795
you may have to walk away
from everything.

984
01:13:01,797 --> 01:13:04,165
Everyone.

985
01:13:07,370 --> 01:13:09,971
Thank you for today, Michael.

986
01:13:09,973 --> 01:13:12,209
- See you tomorrow.
- Mm-hmm.

987
01:13:17,982 --> 01:13:20,517
You're gonna be
on the podium any day now,

988
01:13:20,519 --> 01:13:23,988
so you should have a plan.

989
01:13:23,990 --> 01:13:26,893
Unless you really think
you can change.

990
01:13:28,695 --> 01:13:30,861
Or even want to.

991
01:13:37,572 --> 01:13:39,772
<i>I don't want
to be here anymore.</i>

992
01:13:39,774 --> 01:13:41,940
It's a trial. It...

993
01:13:41,942 --> 01:13:44,110
- I don't feel good here.
- Nobody feels good

994
01:13:44,112 --> 01:13:46,346
- about you being there, Jared.
- I-I don't, I don't...

995
01:13:46,348 --> 01:13:48,382
I'm not sure
if I feel any different.

996
01:13:48,384 --> 01:13:52,386
Son, son, you're...
you're not even halfway through.

997
01:13:52,388 --> 01:13:54,855
Why didn't you tell me
how long I might stay for?

998
01:13:54,857 --> 01:13:56,758
None of us knows
the answer to that, Jared.

999
01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:57,891
It's kind of up to you.

1000
01:13:57,893 --> 01:13:59,761
You know, you just got to
give it a chance.

1001
01:13:59,763 --> 01:14:01,196
This is like
the book of Matthew.

1002
01:14:01,198 --> 01:14:02,931
The Devil's not gonna
ask you once;

1003
01:14:02,933 --> 01:14:04,767
he's gonna ask you
over and over again, son.

1004
01:14:04,769 --> 01:14:06,268
And you have just got to find

1005
01:14:06,270 --> 01:14:08,870
the strength and commitment
inside you.

1006
01:14:08,872 --> 01:14:12,709
You can get through this, okay?

1007
01:14:12,711 --> 01:14:14,478
Okay?

1008
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:17,481
- All right.
- It's late. Get some sleep.

1009
01:14:17,483 --> 01:14:20,052
- Good night.
- Good night.

1010
01:14:58,195 --> 01:15:01,931
Jared? You're gonna be late.

1011
01:15:32,801 --> 01:15:34,967
<i>I had thoughts of men.</i>

1012
01:15:34,969 --> 01:15:37,572
Boys at school.

1013
01:15:37,574 --> 01:15:39,809
At college, I...

1014
01:15:41,978 --> 01:15:43,978
My imagination.

1015
01:15:49,353 --> 01:15:51,554
Hey, what's going on?

1016
01:15:51,556 --> 01:15:53,558
I have no idea.

1017
01:15:57,596 --> 01:16:01,067
- Michael, what's going on?
- Just grab a tie.

1018
01:16:06,874 --> 01:16:09,206
Sadly, we are
gathered here today

1019
01:16:09,208 --> 01:16:13,345
to say farewell to our son,

1020
01:16:13,347 --> 01:16:15,113
- our friend and our brother...
- Okay.

1021
01:16:15,115 --> 01:16:17,115
...Cameron Van Heusen,

1022
01:16:17,117 --> 01:16:19,685
who, by his own making
last night,

1023
01:16:19,687 --> 01:16:22,056
fell prey to Satan's wishes.

1024
01:16:23,691 --> 01:16:28,228
Brother Van Heusen, is this
what you want for your son?

1025
01:16:28,230 --> 01:16:30,464
No.

1026
01:16:30,466 --> 01:16:33,868
Young man, is this you?

1027
01:16:33,870 --> 01:16:35,871
Brother Cameron,
is this what you want?

1028
01:16:35,873 --> 01:16:37,373
No.

1029
01:16:37,375 --> 01:16:41,042
Both of you, come on.

1030
01:16:41,044 --> 01:16:44,380
- Bring him down here.
- Let's go.

1031
01:16:44,382 --> 01:16:47,218
- Who's gonna strike this demon down?
- I will.

1032
01:16:50,455 --> 01:16:53,323
Out, you demon! Hit him!

1033
01:16:53,325 --> 01:16:54,959
Get out of him!

1034
01:16:54,961 --> 01:16:56,159
That's it.

1035
01:16:56,161 --> 01:16:58,930
- Out!
- Leave, demon! Leave!

1036
01:17:18,253 --> 01:17:20,421
Ow!

1037
01:18:47,353 --> 01:18:50,690
- Yeah. Wow.
- It wasn't so bad, actually.

1038
01:18:54,729 --> 01:18:56,597
Sarah, come on.

1039
01:19:31,336 --> 01:19:33,573
<i>Stay with me.</i>

1040
01:19:36,844 --> 01:19:40,247
<i>I'll prove to you
that God won't strike you down.</i>

1041
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:17,222
All right, take your seat.
Welcome back, son.

1042
01:21:18,725 --> 01:21:21,525
Now, I don't know
about y'all, but today,

1043
01:21:21,527 --> 01:21:23,294
whew, I feel invigorated.

1044
01:21:23,296 --> 01:21:26,899
And I feel hopeful
and a true sense

1045
01:21:26,901 --> 01:21:32,371
that anything is possible today
in this room.

1046
01:21:32,373 --> 01:21:36,043
Cameron, how do you feel, son?

1047
01:21:36,045 --> 01:21:38,248
I feel great, sir.

1048
01:21:39,548 --> 01:21:42,382
Do you feel the true presence
of God in your heart?

1049
01:21:42,384 --> 01:21:44,285
Yes, sir.

1050
01:21:44,287 --> 01:21:46,921
And that feels great,
doesn't it?

1051
01:21:46,923 --> 01:21:49,325
Yes, sir, it-it does.

1052
01:21:49,327 --> 01:21:51,229
For sure.

1053
01:21:54,565 --> 01:21:56,565
Happy for you, son.

1054
01:21:58,336 --> 01:22:01,138
Moral inventory.

1055
01:22:04,509 --> 01:22:07,747
Jared, you're up, son.

1056
01:22:10,750 --> 01:22:12,684
Come on.

1057
01:22:12,686 --> 01:22:14,954
Come on, son.

1058
01:22:14,956 --> 01:22:17,024
All right. Michael.

1059
01:22:28,437 --> 01:22:31,705
And when you're ready.

1060
01:22:34,210 --> 01:22:37,880
I had thoughts of men.

1061
01:22:37,882 --> 01:22:41,082
Boys at school.

1062
01:22:41,084 --> 01:22:44,386
On TV, on the street,
in my imagination.

1063
01:22:44,388 --> 01:22:46,389
At college,
I held the hand of a boy,

1064
01:22:46,391 --> 01:22:48,561
and I stayed through the night
in his bed.

1065
01:22:51,897 --> 01:22:53,764
For these thoughts
and this action,

1066
01:22:53,766 --> 01:22:55,432
for which I felt regretful,

1067
01:22:55,434 --> 01:22:58,168
- I'd like to ask for God's...
- Wait. Wait. Hold on.

1068
01:22:58,170 --> 01:23:00,739
Jared.

1069
01:23:00,741 --> 01:23:02,942
Come on.

1070
01:23:02,944 --> 01:23:06,077
What else?

1071
01:23:06,079 --> 01:23:08,313
I never...

1072
01:23:08,315 --> 01:23:10,749
I-I stayed through the night
with the boy from college,

1073
01:23:10,751 --> 01:23:12,319
but we never did anything more.

1074
01:23:12,321 --> 01:23:15,622
Listen, don't even try
lying to God, Jared.

1075
01:23:15,624 --> 01:23:17,657
He already sees.

1076
01:23:17,659 --> 01:23:21,261
So, come on. What else?

1077
01:23:21,263 --> 01:23:23,097
Well...

1078
01:23:23,099 --> 01:23:25,000
I lied on my genogram.

1079
01:23:25,002 --> 01:23:26,534
My uncle Chris
wasn't an alcoholic.

1080
01:23:26,536 --> 01:23:30,173
Why don't you tell us
about this Henry boy?

1081
01:23:31,775 --> 01:23:33,875
That your daddy told me about.

1082
01:23:33,877 --> 01:23:36,446
That's not... that's not fair.

1083
01:23:36,448 --> 01:23:39,782
- Why not?
- That's-that's not my sin.

1084
01:23:39,784 --> 01:23:42,285
Do you want to waste
these people's time?

1085
01:23:42,287 --> 01:23:43,453
I'm not.

1086
01:23:43,455 --> 01:23:45,823
No, these people
who got up here honestly

1087
01:23:45,825 --> 01:23:47,191
and were brave and...

1088
01:23:47,193 --> 01:23:48,292
Well, I could
make something up.

1089
01:23:48,294 --> 01:23:49,293
I could make something up.

1090
01:23:49,295 --> 01:23:50,461
- Is that, is that what you...
- Yeah.

1091
01:23:50,463 --> 01:23:52,697
I-Is that what
you want me to do?

1092
01:23:52,699 --> 01:23:55,033
Isn't-isn't that a-a sin, too?

1093
01:23:55,035 --> 01:23:57,068
I mean,
if-if thoughts are a sin,

1094
01:23:57,070 --> 01:23:58,570
I ask God's forgiveness
for that,

1095
01:23:58,572 --> 01:24:01,409
but I'm not,
I'm not making anything up.

1096
01:24:05,647 --> 01:24:08,149
Okay, then. Okay.

1097
01:24:09,985 --> 01:24:11,487
Lie chair.

1098
01:24:12,656 --> 01:24:16,526
I just want to make use
of some of this anger.

1099
01:24:18,828 --> 01:24:21,262
Uh, wait.
Guys, just... just sit.

1100
01:24:21,264 --> 01:24:23,666
Just stay where you are, okay?

1101
01:24:23,668 --> 01:24:25,434
Here he is, Jared.

1102
01:24:25,436 --> 01:24:27,670
Your father is sitting here,
and I want to,

1103
01:24:27,672 --> 01:24:31,273
I want you to tell him
how affected you are by him

1104
01:24:31,275 --> 01:24:33,910
and how angry you are.

1105
01:24:33,912 --> 01:24:35,445
Tell him how you hate him

1106
01:24:35,447 --> 01:24:37,347
for the things that's he's,
the way he...

1107
01:24:37,349 --> 01:24:39,517
- Sit down. Sit down.
- But I'm not angry.

1108
01:24:39,519 --> 01:24:41,786
- And-and he's done things that upset me, but...
- Yeah, I know.

1109
01:24:41,788 --> 01:24:43,187
But you are. You just...

1110
01:24:43,189 --> 01:24:44,722
- You're angry, but you don't...
- He's let me down,

1111
01:24:44,724 --> 01:24:47,426
but why-why...
why do I have to be angry?

1112
01:24:47,428 --> 01:24:49,394
Just sit.

1113
01:24:49,396 --> 01:24:51,363
- Sit down.
- I'm not a dog!

1114
01:24:51,365 --> 01:24:53,465
- I know.
- And I don't think anyone is responsible for me,

1115
01:24:53,467 --> 01:24:55,034
so I don't see
how it's gonna help

1116
01:24:55,036 --> 01:24:57,070
picking someone
to blame or hate.

1117
01:24:57,072 --> 01:24:58,438
If you don't hate
anyone, Jared,

1118
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:00,607
then where is all this anger
coming from?

1119
01:25:00,609 --> 01:25:02,042
Because you're
making me angry!

1120
01:25:02,044 --> 01:25:04,278
There you go!
I want you to use that!

1121
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:06,280
I'm not gonna pretend
I hate my father.

1122
01:25:06,282 --> 01:25:09,084
- I don't hate my father.
- Jared, you do.

1123
01:25:09,086 --> 01:25:11,653
You don't know me!
You're all crazy!

1124
01:25:11,655 --> 01:25:13,221
- Hey! I didn't...
- All of you!

1125
01:25:13,223 --> 01:25:15,057
Just... Jared.

1126
01:25:15,059 --> 01:25:18,094
You're in my chair!
There you go!

1127
01:25:18,096 --> 01:25:20,062
- Jared!
- I hate you!

1128
01:25:20,064 --> 01:25:23,767
- But how does that help?!
- Jared.

1129
01:25:33,579 --> 01:25:34,947
Jared!

1130
01:25:34,949 --> 01:25:38,150
Who's in the front office?

1131
01:25:41,922 --> 01:25:45,459
Jared? Son, let's talk. Son?

1132
01:25:47,696 --> 01:25:50,430
Hey. Michael.

1133
01:25:50,432 --> 01:25:52,799
Hey, hey! Give it to me!

1134
01:25:52,801 --> 01:25:54,601
Michael.

1135
01:25:54,603 --> 01:25:57,537
- I want my things and I want to go.
- Hey, Jared. Michael!

1136
01:25:57,539 --> 01:25:58,605
Hey!

1137
01:25:59,710 --> 01:26:03,178
Hey! Michael!
Get out of the room!

1138
01:26:03,180 --> 01:26:05,381
Come here, son.

1139
01:26:07,316 --> 01:26:10,051
Jared? Hey, hey. Hey, listen.

1140
01:26:10,053 --> 01:26:12,822
What you're having is
a natural response, okay?

1141
01:26:12,824 --> 01:26:14,659
Just-just breathe.

1142
01:26:22,903 --> 01:26:24,169
Jared?

1143
01:26:24,171 --> 01:26:26,204
Hey, I just need a minute!

1144
01:26:26,206 --> 01:26:27,472
Be strong.

1145
01:26:27,474 --> 01:26:29,643
- Just go away.
- Take a minute, okay?

1146
01:26:37,351 --> 01:26:40,352
Please pick up, Mom.

1147
01:26:40,354 --> 01:26:42,088
- Jared?
- Mom.

1148
01:26:42,090 --> 01:26:43,757
- Jared?
- Mom, I need you to...

1149
01:26:43,759 --> 01:26:46,392
- I need you to come get me, please.
- What's the matter?

1150
01:26:46,394 --> 01:26:48,729
- What's the matter? What?
- Please, I'm in trouble.

1151
01:26:48,731 --> 01:26:50,064
What's happened?

1152
01:26:50,066 --> 01:26:51,365
Best thing that we can do is

1153
01:26:51,367 --> 01:26:52,867
probably get these guys
back to a session...

1154
01:26:52,869 --> 01:26:56,771
- Hey, son.
- I called my mom and she's coming to get me.

1155
01:26:56,773 --> 01:26:58,740
Listen, you got to understand

1156
01:26:58,742 --> 01:27:00,742
what you're going through
right now is just a moment.

1157
01:27:00,744 --> 01:27:03,046
- A moment? A moment?
- Okay? And I-I feel exactly

1158
01:27:03,048 --> 01:27:04,848
what you're going through.
I think that you and I

1159
01:27:04,850 --> 01:27:06,683
should just get everybody gone,
we just talk.

1160
01:27:06,685 --> 01:27:08,251
I don't want to talk.
I want to go.

1161
01:27:08,253 --> 01:27:10,855
Well, Jared,
I don't want you to.

1162
01:27:10,857 --> 01:27:12,355
I want you to stay.

1163
01:27:12,357 --> 01:27:14,525
Well, I-I read the rules,

1164
01:27:14,527 --> 01:27:17,027
and none of them say
you can stop me from leaving.

1165
01:27:17,029 --> 01:27:18,896
I wouldn't... Can you just check
where Brandon is, please?

1166
01:27:18,898 --> 01:27:23,368
And if you or anyone puts their
hands on me, I have witnesses.

1167
01:27:23,370 --> 01:27:25,304
Nobody's gonna put
their hands on you.

1168
01:27:25,306 --> 01:27:28,373
Why-why would anybody do that?
Come and sit.

1169
01:27:28,375 --> 01:27:30,877
We're gonna wait
for your mom, okay?

1170
01:27:30,879 --> 01:27:33,646
Jesus, our savior,
please focus on Jared.

1171
01:27:33,648 --> 01:27:36,450
Let him see the strength
and courage that he needs.

1172
01:27:36,452 --> 01:27:38,452
I want you to fill him
right now with

1173
01:27:38,454 --> 01:27:39,786
all the wisdom
of everybody in this room

1174
01:27:39,788 --> 01:27:41,588
to show him
how much they love him

1175
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:43,224
and how much
they care about him...

1176
01:27:43,226 --> 01:27:45,226
- Be strong!
- ...and his journey into

1177
01:27:45,228 --> 01:27:46,828
the fire that
he's walking into

1178
01:27:46,830 --> 01:27:49,131
- and what he's willing to face.
- You are a man.

1179
01:27:49,133 --> 01:27:51,499
Let him open his eyes to see
the wisdom that you have...

1180
01:27:51,501 --> 01:27:52,902
- Jared!
- Mom!

1181
01:27:52,904 --> 01:27:54,303
Jared, honey,
what's happening?

1182
01:27:54,305 --> 01:27:55,571
- Mom! - What?
- Hey, hey! Sit back down!

1183
01:27:55,573 --> 01:27:56,739
Mom, they're not letting me go!

1184
01:27:56,741 --> 01:27:58,975
It's not that
we're not letting him go.

1185
01:27:58,977 --> 01:28:01,411
- Come on. Open this door.
- Just hold on, okay?

1186
01:28:01,413 --> 01:28:03,647
- Who are you?
- Mrs. Eamons, my name is Victor Sykes.

1187
01:28:03,649 --> 01:28:05,349
We spoke on the telephone.

1188
01:28:05,351 --> 01:28:06,650
I don't remember that.
Open the door.

1189
01:28:06,652 --> 01:28:08,352
- Well, I spoke with your husband a couple times.
- No.

1190
01:28:08,354 --> 01:28:09,586
Jared's just having
a moment here,

1191
01:28:09,588 --> 01:28:10,788
born out of
a role-playing exercise.

1192
01:28:10,790 --> 01:28:12,423
- Now be still. - It's fine.
- No, no!

1193
01:28:12,425 --> 01:28:14,192
That's not true.
Mom, tell him to open the door.

1194
01:28:14,194 --> 01:28:15,827
- You settle down.
- No. Enough. -

1195
01:28:15,829 --> 01:28:17,963
- Open the door now, Mr. Sykes.
- Shut up, okay?

1196
01:28:17,965 --> 01:28:20,933
- Listen, can we just all...
- I said open the door now!

1197
01:28:20,935 --> 01:28:22,969
I'm gonna call the police
if you don't open this door.

1198
01:28:22,971 --> 01:28:25,471
- There is no need for that. Listen, please.
- Jared!

1199
01:28:25,473 --> 01:28:27,941
Let him go!

1200
01:28:27,943 --> 01:28:31,446
- You all right, honey?
- Just let him go.

1201
01:28:34,785 --> 01:28:37,451
I just... I just think that...

1202
01:28:37,453 --> 01:28:40,155
Jared, come on.

1203
01:28:40,157 --> 01:28:43,625
I just... I think
it's more important for his...

1204
01:28:43,627 --> 01:28:45,961
development right now
that he...

1205
01:28:45,963 --> 01:28:47,630
- he would've stayed.
- Don't even listen to him.

1206
01:28:47,632 --> 01:28:49,799
Get in the car.
Get in the car.

1207
01:28:52,237 --> 01:28:53,904
You're gonna ruin that child.

1208
01:28:53,906 --> 01:28:56,974
What are your actual
qualifications, Mr. Sykes?

1209
01:28:56,976 --> 01:28:59,476
I never asked. Hmm?

1210
01:28:59,478 --> 01:29:02,347
Are you a doctor? Are you?
Psychologist?

1211
01:29:02,349 --> 01:29:04,718
I mean, a proper one? Are you?

1212
01:29:06,653 --> 01:29:09,654
No. I didn't think so.

1213
01:29:09,656 --> 01:29:11,826
Oh.

1214
01:29:12,927 --> 01:29:14,361
Shame on you!

1215
01:29:15,563 --> 01:29:17,563
Shame on me, too.

1216
01:29:17,565 --> 01:29:19,835
Shame on you!

1217
01:29:47,199 --> 01:29:48,966
Can I help you?

1218
01:29:48,968 --> 01:29:51,469
Uh, I'm not sure
if I'm staying or going.

1219
01:29:51,471 --> 01:29:53,939
All right.
Well, let me know.

1220
01:30:04,485 --> 01:30:07,253
I talked to your father.

1221
01:30:07,255 --> 01:30:10,391
He wants you to go back.

1222
01:30:16,399 --> 01:30:18,665
I told him
we'll see him at home.

1223
01:30:18,667 --> 01:30:22,405
I told him you're not
going back.

1224
01:30:25,109 --> 01:30:28,110
You know that night...

1225
01:30:28,112 --> 01:30:31,747
when Pastor Wilkes and Jim
came to the house?

1226
01:30:31,749 --> 01:30:36,019
Those men decided what to do
with you, and I just...

1227
01:30:36,021 --> 01:30:40,426
I fell into line,
like I usually do.

1228
01:30:41,993 --> 01:30:44,594
They say sometimes
you got to hurt a child

1229
01:30:44,596 --> 01:30:46,764
in order to help them,
and that may be so

1230
01:30:46,766 --> 01:30:48,699
with some things, but...

1231
01:30:48,701 --> 01:30:52,437
a mother knows
when something isn't right.

1232
01:30:52,439 --> 01:30:56,174
And I knew in my bones...

1233
01:30:56,176 --> 01:30:58,880
this wasn't hurting to help.

1234
01:31:00,682 --> 01:31:05,454
I was just letting you down,
and I kept my mouth shut.

1235
01:31:09,125 --> 01:31:12,626
And I will always regret that.

1236
01:31:14,965 --> 01:31:18,199
But I can do
a different thing now,

1237
01:31:18,201 --> 01:31:20,670
now that I have a chance.

1238
01:31:25,676 --> 01:31:29,146
I'll handle your father.

1239
01:31:29,148 --> 01:31:32,885
He can fall into line with me
for a change.

1240
01:31:38,091 --> 01:31:41,593
<i>Some folk,
they don't go to church</i>

1241
01:31:41,595 --> 01:31:44,063
for the right reasons.

1242
01:31:46,834 --> 01:31:51,006
Now, you know the type
of person I'm talking about.

1243
01:31:53,542 --> 01:31:55,744
They just turn up.

1244
01:31:59,882 --> 01:32:05,186
They don't use every day
of their Christian life...

1245
01:32:05,188 --> 01:32:07,021
to praise the Lord

1246
01:32:07,023 --> 01:32:10,792
and to help bring others
to his word.

1247
01:32:10,794 --> 01:32:13,963
It might be your neighbor,
it might be your friend,

1248
01:32:13,965 --> 01:32:16,698
it might be just a face
you only ever see at church.

1249
01:32:16,700 --> 01:32:19,936
They just turn up.

1250
01:32:19,938 --> 01:32:21,537
I will tell you something
that I know.

1251
01:32:21,539 --> 01:32:25,209
Just turning up to church
does not make you a Christian!

1252
01:32:25,211 --> 01:32:27,711
- Yes, sir.
- Amen.

1253
01:32:27,713 --> 01:32:30,582
Study the Bible.
Study his word.

1254
01:32:30,584 --> 01:32:36,555
I guarantee you,
every question you have...

1255
01:32:36,557 --> 01:32:41,560
you gonna find an answer
in this book.

1256
01:32:41,562 --> 01:32:43,164
- Yes.
- Amen.

1257
01:32:51,441 --> 01:32:53,241
Honey,

1258
01:32:53,243 --> 01:32:58,346
um, do you know a boy,
um, Cameron Van Heusen?

1259
01:32:58,348 --> 01:33:00,983
Yeah. Is he here?

1260
01:33:00,985 --> 01:33:04,286
No. No, no.
That-That's the police.

1261
01:33:04,288 --> 01:33:07,756
Apparently,
this-this boy Cameron

1262
01:33:07,758 --> 01:33:09,960
killed himself last night.

1263
01:33:18,937 --> 01:33:22,775
They want to ask you
some questions.

1264
01:34:32,620 --> 01:34:35,122
Thank you.

1265
01:34:55,279 --> 01:34:56,780
- Hey!
- Hi!

1266
01:34:56,782 --> 01:34:58,949
- How are you?
- Hi. How you doing?

1267
01:34:58,951 --> 01:35:01,218
Yeah. Nice to see you!

1268
01:35:01,220 --> 01:35:02,820
I'm good.

1269
01:35:04,824 --> 01:35:07,392
Yeah, I think
they're in the dishwasher.

1270
01:35:07,394 --> 01:35:09,394
Come on, Chris.

1271
01:35:09,396 --> 01:35:11,096
Join us.

1272
01:35:19,073 --> 01:35:20,906
- Oh!
- Did you call it?

1273
01:35:20,908 --> 01:35:22,141
- I didn't hear you...
- Yes!

1274
01:35:22,143 --> 01:35:23,744
I didn't hear you call it.

1275
01:36:29,720 --> 01:36:31,520
- Mom...
- I gave it to him.

1276
01:36:31,522 --> 01:36:35,492
He has it and he'll read it.
He knows he has to.

1277
01:36:35,494 --> 01:36:37,894
M-Mom, it's important
he reads it.

1278
01:36:37,896 --> 01:36:39,562
Can you just put him on?

1279
01:36:39,564 --> 01:36:42,265
Well... I'm calling you
from Little Rock.

1280
01:36:42,267 --> 01:36:45,435
- I'm with Aunt Mary, so you...
- Wait. Why?

1281
01:36:45,437 --> 01:36:48,038
You should just
call him at home.

1282
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:50,040
What happened?

1283
01:36:50,042 --> 01:36:52,376
Nothing. She just needed
some help with the shop,

1284
01:36:52,378 --> 01:36:55,680
so I came down here, and I'm
driving back tonight. I'm...

1285
01:36:55,682 --> 01:36:58,885
Nothing. Nothing is wrong.

1286
01:37:27,418 --> 01:37:29,986
<i>Seriously, nothing is wrong.</i>

1287
01:37:29,988 --> 01:37:33,322
<i>Why didn't you tell me
you were coming?</i>

1288
01:37:33,324 --> 01:37:34,892
Is he here?

1289
01:37:34,894 --> 01:37:37,662
He left. It is Sunday.

1290
01:37:37,664 --> 01:37:40,232
If it's urgent, you're
gonna have to go to church.

1291
01:37:41,634 --> 01:37:43,099
Why aren't you there?

1292
01:37:43,101 --> 01:37:45,338
Why aren't you at church?

1293
01:37:47,608 --> 01:37:49,441
I go, sometimes.

1294
01:37:49,443 --> 01:37:52,411
I-I support your dad,
and-and...

1295
01:37:52,413 --> 01:37:55,249
Mom, what's going on
with you two?

1296
01:37:57,184 --> 01:37:59,853
Jared, it's...

1297
01:37:59,855 --> 01:38:01,855
He knows.

1298
01:38:01,857 --> 01:38:04,927
I can't be around the...

1299
01:38:06,996 --> 01:38:09,163
I love God.

1300
01:38:09,165 --> 01:38:11,435
God loves me.

1301
01:38:13,437 --> 01:38:15,705
And I love my son.

1302
01:38:15,707 --> 01:38:17,607
That simple.

1303
01:38:17,609 --> 01:38:23,112
For your father,
it's a little more complicated.

1304
01:38:23,114 --> 01:38:26,016
I wish it wasn't, but it is.

1305
01:39:01,992 --> 01:39:03,825
Did you hear about
the article I've got

1306
01:39:03,827 --> 01:39:06,327
coming out in <i>The Times?</i>

1307
01:39:06,329 --> 01:39:09,097
Do you know what it's about?

1308
01:39:09,099 --> 01:39:12,101
I don't want to get
into a fight.

1309
01:39:12,103 --> 01:39:15,004
- Your mother told me, son.
- It's not a fight.

1310
01:39:15,006 --> 01:39:17,206
I'm just...
doing the right thing.

1311
01:39:17,208 --> 01:39:20,044
I'm letting you know.

1312
01:39:20,046 --> 01:39:22,781
I've written more,
and the publishers are

1313
01:39:22,783 --> 01:39:26,450
talking about me putting
together a whole book.

1314
01:39:26,452 --> 01:39:30,722
You don't need to read
any of it.

1315
01:39:30,724 --> 01:39:32,357
I just needed you to know

1316
01:39:32,359 --> 01:39:34,126
that-that it might
be out there.

1317
01:39:34,128 --> 01:39:37,396
Well... now I know.

1318
01:39:37,398 --> 01:39:40,433
But it might be good
for you to read.

1319
01:39:40,435 --> 01:39:45,304
Because you never really asked
what went on there.

1320
01:39:45,306 --> 01:39:48,576
You never really knew
the staff or...

1321
01:39:48,578 --> 01:39:51,211
- or...
- You're right. You're right.

1322
01:39:51,213 --> 01:39:54,382
When the situation came up,

1323
01:39:54,384 --> 01:39:58,220
I did what I've often done
in my life.

1324
01:39:58,222 --> 01:40:01,824
I sought the counsel
of wiser men,

1325
01:40:01,826 --> 01:40:04,293
and I followed their advice.

1326
01:40:04,295 --> 01:40:06,896
What would you do now?

1327
01:40:06,898 --> 01:40:08,898
Now that you're running things.

1328
01:40:08,900 --> 01:40:10,803
Enough.

1329
01:40:14,173 --> 01:40:16,576
Good night.

1330
01:40:45,608 --> 01:40:48,278
For me.

1331
01:41:38,367 --> 01:41:40,401
Is there something
you need help with?

1332
01:41:40,403 --> 01:41:42,771
'Cause, you know,
I got to make my flight.

1333
01:41:42,773 --> 01:41:45,340
Yeah, now, this was
gonna be for Christmas,

1334
01:41:45,342 --> 01:41:47,944
but, uh, well, you know,
your mother tells me

1335
01:41:47,946 --> 01:41:50,012
you like to drive upstate
sometimes to write.

1336
01:41:50,014 --> 01:41:52,684
Dad, I live in New York;
I don't need a car.

1337
01:41:53,685 --> 01:41:55,853
She also tells me...

1338
01:41:55,855 --> 01:41:59,290
you like to write by hand
before you use your computer.

1339
01:41:59,292 --> 01:42:01,393
Just like me.

1340
01:42:02,696 --> 01:42:04,229
This pen...

1341
01:42:04,231 --> 01:42:08,635
is made from a cedar tree
grown in Israel.

1342
01:42:10,071 --> 01:42:11,871
Guided me.

1343
01:42:11,873 --> 01:42:14,540
I've written every sermon
that I've ever delivered

1344
01:42:14,542 --> 01:42:17,645
in this new church
with this pen.

1345
01:42:21,083 --> 01:42:23,485
One writer to another.

1346
01:42:35,066 --> 01:42:37,635
I don't want
to pretend anymore.

1347
01:42:39,436 --> 01:42:41,436
We don't need
to spend time together.

1348
01:42:41,438 --> 01:42:43,273
We don't need to speak

1349
01:42:43,275 --> 01:42:46,343
unless we're gonna talk
to each other properly.

1350
01:42:46,345 --> 01:42:50,080
Like... you-you've done
some things

1351
01:42:50,082 --> 01:42:52,917
that have really hurt me.

1352
01:42:52,919 --> 01:42:55,586
Like-like you never,
you never asked

1353
01:42:55,588 --> 01:42:58,326
if there was more
to my story at college.

1354
01:43:00,128 --> 01:43:03,362
You never asked if I was okay.

1355
01:43:03,364 --> 01:43:06,868
You were too focused
on how it affected you.

1356
01:43:10,105 --> 01:43:15,175
There are so many things
that we've never spoken about.

1357
01:43:15,177 --> 01:43:18,212
And I don't know
if we ever will.

1358
01:43:18,214 --> 01:43:20,015
Yeah.

1359
01:43:25,957 --> 01:43:29,124
You know, all this
was gonna be yours.

1360
01:43:29,126 --> 01:43:32,460
I-I mean, it still will be,
but I meant to run and to...

1361
01:43:32,462 --> 01:43:34,833
make a living from.

1362
01:43:38,371 --> 01:43:40,971
I understand.

1363
01:43:40,973 --> 01:43:43,343
We all got our own paths.

1364
01:43:44,743 --> 01:43:49,547
The truth is
I want you to do well.

1365
01:43:49,549 --> 01:43:52,317
I want you to have
a great life.

1366
01:43:52,319 --> 01:43:53,988
I love you.

1367
01:43:55,689 --> 01:43:58,825
But I can't pretend, either.

1368
01:43:58,827 --> 01:44:01,428
There are things
I disagree with.

1369
01:44:01,430 --> 01:44:03,663
And I'll admit,
I'm gonna be honest,

1370
01:44:03,665 --> 01:44:06,333
I'm, you know...
I am being prideful

1371
01:44:06,335 --> 01:44:09,569
when I resent the fact that
I may never be a grandparent.

1372
01:44:09,571 --> 01:44:11,538
Now, that's just the truth.

1373
01:44:11,540 --> 01:44:14,878
It's hard for me to admit
that I have hurt you.

1374
01:44:16,680 --> 01:44:20,081
And that with my beliefs
and with all that's gone on,

1375
01:44:20,083 --> 01:44:24,454
I understand I-I may have
set myself up to lose you.

1376
01:44:24,456 --> 01:44:28,425
And I've had to ask myself,
and God,

1377
01:44:28,427 --> 01:44:30,628
if I'm ready for that.

1378
01:44:38,071 --> 01:44:42,474
I do not want to lose you.

1379
01:44:42,476 --> 01:44:44,542
Well, it doesn't feel like that.

1380
01:44:44,544 --> 01:44:46,545
I'm sick of avoiding you.

1381
01:44:46,547 --> 01:44:48,881
I'm sick of talking
about nothing.

1382
01:44:48,883 --> 01:44:51,418
I'm sick of it.

1383
01:44:51,420 --> 01:44:54,720
I'm gay, and I'm your son.

1384
01:44:54,722 --> 01:44:57,825
And neither of those things
are going to change.

1385
01:44:57,827 --> 01:45:00,061
Okay? So let's deal with that.

1386
01:45:00,063 --> 01:45:01,896
Or let's call it a day.

1387
01:45:01,898 --> 01:45:07,103
Both of us would be okay,
but that would be a shame.

1388
01:45:10,574 --> 01:45:15,078
I'm not changing.
There's no changing me.

1389
01:45:15,080 --> 01:45:17,180
God knows I tried.

1390
01:45:17,182 --> 01:45:21,619
So if you mean it...
if you really mean that...

1391
01:45:23,589 --> 01:45:28,292
...and you're not ready
to lose me...

1392
01:45:28,294 --> 01:45:29,793
then I'm sorry,

1393
01:45:29,795 --> 01:45:34,032
but you're gonna have to be
the one to change.

1394
01:45:34,034 --> 01:45:36,037
I understand.

1395
01:45:39,006 --> 01:45:41,008
I am gonna try.

1396
01:45:46,549 --> 01:45:48,784
I'll try.

1397
01:45:50,453 --> 01:45:52,654
I got to get going.

1398
01:46:18,151 --> 01:46:19,916
Dad...

1399
01:46:19,918 --> 01:46:23,188
I've invited Mom
to my place for Christmas.

1400
01:46:23,190 --> 01:46:25,423
Yeah.

1401
01:46:25,425 --> 01:46:28,495
You're welcome to come, too.
