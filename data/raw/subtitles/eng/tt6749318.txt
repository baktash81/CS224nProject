2
00:01:09,951 --> 00:01:11,684
Can I help you?

3
00:01:11,686 --> 00:01:13,586
I'm lookin', uh,

4
00:01:13,588 --> 00:01:15,988
for Ben Aronoff.

5
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,124
I'm afraid he's not in.

6
00:01:17,126 --> 00:01:18,594
Huh.

7
00:01:20,429 --> 00:01:22,129
I've been trying to
reach him for a week,

8
00:01:22,131 --> 00:01:24,029
but he hasn't
gotten back to me.

9
00:01:24,031 --> 00:01:27,102
I call, and I call, and I call.

10
00:01:29,103 --> 00:01:33,139
Now, look, my boss
is a very wealthy man

11
00:01:33,141 --> 00:01:36,175
who wants to buy a boat.

12
00:01:36,177 --> 00:01:37,710
And he wants to buy the boat

13
00:01:37,712 --> 00:01:39,579
before he goes
back to Michigan.

14
00:01:39,581 --> 00:01:42,082
Now, look, I'm just trying to
give this man some money.

15
00:01:42,084 --> 00:01:43,786
I'm Ben.

16
00:01:45,186 --> 00:01:47,053
Why don't you bring
your boss in?

17
00:01:47,055 --> 00:01:49,959
We'll show him some boats,
and he can see what he likes.

18
00:01:53,495 --> 00:01:54,931
My boss...

19
00:01:56,031 --> 00:01:58,564
took me from the gutter,

20
00:01:58,566 --> 00:02:01,100
gave me a job.

21
00:02:01,102 --> 00:02:05,772
Everything I have,
everything I am, I owe to him.

22
00:02:05,774 --> 00:02:09,042
I'd do anything for my boss.

23
00:02:09,044 --> 00:02:13,647
Anything... and everything.

24
00:02:13,649 --> 00:02:17,552
I'd never turn my back
on my boss.

25
00:02:20,222 --> 00:02:23,626
You tell your boss
that I'm done.

26
00:02:25,026 --> 00:02:28,661
I don't owe anybody anything.

27
00:02:28,663 --> 00:02:31,666
I'm paid in full and more so.

28
00:02:32,867 --> 00:02:34,002
You tell him that.

29
00:02:35,837 --> 00:02:39,138
OK. I'll tell him.

30
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,676
I'll tell him every word.

31
00:03:42,737 --> 00:03:44,004
Hey, Ben.

32
00:03:47,742 --> 00:03:49,910
<i>You couldn't build a
fuckin' outhouse right now</i>

33
00:03:49,912 --> 00:03:52,044
<i>without somebody
blowing up your goddamned car!</i>

34
00:03:52,046 --> 00:03:54,915
Irv, calm the fuck down
and just tell me what happened.

35
00:03:54,917 --> 00:03:56,917
<i>It's over! The war's over.
We lost, man.</i>

36
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:58,785
No. No, what did Lansky say?

37
00:03:58,787 --> 00:04:00,053
<i>You don't get it!</i>

38
00:04:00,055 --> 00:04:01,887
What did he say?

39
00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:03,322
<i>We're done!
We're out of business, Ben!</i>

40
00:04:03,324 --> 00:04:06,959
<i>We lost the union!
You still got your cash, right?</i>

41
00:04:06,961 --> 00:04:08,828
Son of a bitch.

42
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,064
- <i>What's that?</i>
- I got it.

43
00:04:11,066 --> 00:04:13,632
<i>You've always
been a lucky bastard.</i>

44
00:04:13,634 --> 00:04:15,302
<i>Now grab your family
and your money,</i>

45
00:04:15,304 --> 00:04:18,240
<i>and get the hell out
before things get any worse!</i>

46
00:04:20,242 --> 00:04:25,812
<i>I'm Ben Aronoff, contractor,
entrepreneur, husband, father,</i>

47
00:04:25,814 --> 00:04:27,747
<i>and out of business.</i>

48
00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:29,649
<i>Time to start over.</i>

49
00:04:54,009 --> 00:04:55,878
You gotta see this.

50
00:05:04,752 --> 00:05:08,387
We are done with
winters in New Jersey.

51
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:11,024
New start, babe.

52
00:05:11,026 --> 00:05:16,695
What about our house, Ben,
and the construction business?

53
00:05:16,697 --> 00:05:17,998
We outgrew it.

54
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,636
Coney Island, New Jersey...

55
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:26,038
It's a new beginning,
Mrs. Aronoff. We're in Florida.

56
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,742
New life.

57
00:05:29,043 --> 00:05:31,711
I'm not sure what was wrong
with our old life.

58
00:05:31,713 --> 00:05:35,818
You're swinging with
Tarzan now. Hang on.

59
00:05:42,923 --> 00:05:46,361
I'm going down to the front desk
to square some things away.

60
00:05:55,403 --> 00:05:58,038
Hey, hey, hey.
Come on. Keep it down.

61
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,240
You two over there,
Melissa in this bed.

62
00:06:01,242 --> 00:06:03,075
Settle down.

63
00:06:03,077 --> 00:06:04,411
I'm coming back
in two minutes,

64
00:06:04,413 --> 00:06:06,079
turning off the lights.

65
00:06:15,223 --> 00:06:16,723
- Hey.
- Bourbon neat.

66
00:06:16,725 --> 00:06:18,160
You got it.

67
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,774
Two Millers and a highball.

68
00:06:34,776 --> 00:06:36,209
You got it.

69
00:06:36,211 --> 00:06:37,976
Well, if I had known
that you were working,

70
00:06:37,978 --> 00:06:40,245
I'd have taken a table.

71
00:06:40,247 --> 00:06:43,216
It's never too late.

72
00:06:43,218 --> 00:06:45,084
The king of construction,

73
00:06:45,086 --> 00:06:47,286
- Big Ben.
- Jules!

74
00:06:47,288 --> 00:06:51,291
<i>Now this guy is Jules
Bergman, Meyer Lansky's main man.</i>

75
00:06:51,293 --> 00:06:53,325
<i>Very connected
and very dangerous.</i>

76
00:06:53,327 --> 00:06:55,995
- How are ya?
- Welcome to Miami.

77
00:06:55,997 --> 00:06:58,098
- Thank you.
- Find everything? Family good?

78
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,733
Yes. Yes. We're all
settled in upstairs...

79
00:07:00,735 --> 00:07:02,868
and I thank you
for the arrangements.

80
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,870
Of course.

81
00:07:04,872 --> 00:07:08,440
They tell me you built
100 houses in one suburb

82
00:07:08,442 --> 00:07:11,777
from dirt-to-sold
in under four months?

83
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:14,079
More than once.
Drove the banks crazy.

84
00:07:14,081 --> 00:07:16,252
Wow. Let's have a seat.

85
00:07:17,351 --> 00:07:19,154
Sure.

86
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,158
So you call me
when you're ready

87
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,060
and I'll get you in
front of the old man.

88
00:07:28,062 --> 00:07:29,962
Well, how is he?

89
00:07:29,964 --> 00:07:31,430
When Castro came
back to Havana

90
00:07:31,432 --> 00:07:34,099
and stole
Mr. Lansky's casino,

91
00:07:34,101 --> 00:07:36,069
who took care of me?

92
00:07:36,071 --> 00:07:37,771
Who got me off the island?

93
00:07:37,773 --> 00:07:41,007
If you cut open
Mr. Lansky's heart,

94
00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:44,176
he would bleed only loyalty.

95
00:07:44,178 --> 00:07:46,079
To you too, Ben.

96
00:07:46,081 --> 00:07:49,115
You know, I appreciate that.
I appreciate all of it, but I,

97
00:07:49,117 --> 00:07:51,284
I want to do something
on my own here, you know?

98
00:07:51,286 --> 00:07:54,320
A new town, new beginning.

99
00:07:54,322 --> 00:07:57,890
Like a second game
of a doubleheader.

100
00:07:57,892 --> 00:08:00,793
So what are your plans?

101
00:08:00,795 --> 00:08:02,197
Like usual, to win.

102
00:08:04,365 --> 00:08:06,034
OK.

103
00:08:07,201 --> 00:08:10,103
You call me when you're ready.

104
00:08:10,105 --> 00:08:14,039
- Good seeing ya.
- Good to see you.

105
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,777
Thanks.

106
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:25,418
So, you still want that table?

107
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,553
Why wouldn't I?

108
00:09:00,922 --> 00:09:02,258
Ben?

109
00:09:03,258 --> 00:09:04,456
Shelley?

110
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,158
Shelley Katz, real estate law.

111
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,926
<i>Yep, he was a
small-time lawyer,</i>

112
00:09:07,928 --> 00:09:09,462
<i>but I needed someone hungry.</i>

113
00:09:09,464 --> 00:09:14,334
- How are ya?
- I'm great. Here's my card.

114
00:09:14,336 --> 00:09:16,169
So do you, uh,

115
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:19,137
make the laws or do you
figure out ways to break 'em?

116
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:20,809
Scotch rocks.

117
00:09:22,043 --> 00:09:25,344
I make, I break.
I just don't do floors.

118
00:09:25,346 --> 00:09:27,079
And what about you,
Mr. Big Shot?

119
00:09:27,081 --> 00:09:28,882
No, I checked up on you.

120
00:09:28,884 --> 00:09:31,184
Giant shopping centers,
entire neighborhoods.

121
00:09:31,186 --> 00:09:33,453
What are you planning
for Miami? Pyramids?

122
00:09:33,455 --> 00:09:35,421
Just looking for opportunities.

123
00:09:35,423 --> 00:09:39,092
Well then, for the record,
beyond my hourly rate,

124
00:09:39,094 --> 00:09:40,993
I take 5% of any deal we close.

125
00:09:40,995 --> 00:09:44,263
I'm a lot more than purchase
agreements and deeds of trust.

126
00:09:44,265 --> 00:09:45,400
3%.

127
00:09:51,273 --> 00:09:52,942
OK.

128
00:09:55,076 --> 00:09:56,910
You're too damn easy.

129
00:09:56,912 --> 00:09:58,611
That's my new client discount.

130
00:09:58,613 --> 00:10:02,448
All right, tell me Counselor,
what do you know about that?

131
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,950
That, my friend...

132
00:10:04,952 --> 00:10:07,152
is what makes Miami <i>Miami.</i>

133
00:10:07,154 --> 00:10:09,055
It beats the hell
out of concrete and dirt.

134
00:10:09,057 --> 00:10:10,956
Mm-hmm.

135
00:10:39,988 --> 00:10:41,257
You're hired.

136
00:10:43,325 --> 00:10:44,460
For what?

137
00:10:49,197 --> 00:10:51,564
- How ya doing?
- Good, you?

138
00:10:51,566 --> 00:10:53,999
- Ben.
- Knocky House, Mr. Aronoff.

139
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:56,102
Knocky? Is that you real name?

140
00:10:56,104 --> 00:10:58,470
- It's what my friends call me.
- Oh, yeah?

141
00:10:58,472 --> 00:10:59,973
Yeah.

142
00:10:59,975 --> 00:11:01,373
So what do you got in there?

143
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:04,209
Twin 327 cubic inch Chevy V-8s.

144
00:11:04,211 --> 00:11:07,313
Oh, yeah?

145
00:11:07,315 --> 00:11:08,617
Wow.

146
00:11:10,317 --> 00:11:13,719
Yeah! Let's get out there!

147
00:11:13,721 --> 00:11:16,925
- Go ahead, open her up!
- Let's do it!

148
00:11:19,995 --> 00:11:21,529
Use that line!

149
00:11:25,265 --> 00:11:26,634
All right!

150
00:11:30,004 --> 00:11:31,439
Woo!

151
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:40,113
<i>And boom, just like that,
I was in love.</i>

152
00:11:40,115 --> 00:11:42,448
<i>The speed, the water, the rush.</i>

153
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:46,155
<i>I wanted it, I needed it,
I would have it.</i>

154
00:11:47,288 --> 00:11:48,957
Ready?

155
00:11:50,258 --> 00:11:53,095
Yeah! I never get
tired of this shit!

156
00:11:58,365 --> 00:12:00,199
What do you think, guys?

157
00:12:00,201 --> 00:12:03,136
And you, come here.

158
00:12:03,138 --> 00:12:06,339
How about this? Whose name
do you think should be there?

159
00:12:06,341 --> 00:12:09,244
- Who?
- Yours, silly!

160
00:12:13,181 --> 00:12:15,281
What do you think?

161
00:12:15,283 --> 00:12:20,055
- Yeah, it is kinda sexy.
- Yeah. It is.

162
00:12:25,659 --> 00:12:28,427
<i>Now this here
was my first race</i>

163
00:12:28,429 --> 00:12:30,430
<i>against a bunch
of rich fat cats</i>

164
00:12:30,432 --> 00:12:33,101
<i>and their toys, and I loved it.</i>

165
00:12:44,611 --> 00:12:47,680
That's the suckers
we gotta beat right there.

166
00:12:47,682 --> 00:12:51,084
Bet they never wrestled
a kid from Brooklyn College.

167
00:13:22,616 --> 00:13:23,715
Keep the throttle down!

168
00:13:23,717 --> 00:13:25,788
- Let's go for it!
- I'm on it!

169
00:13:35,864 --> 00:13:37,696
We're doing it!

170
00:13:37,698 --> 00:13:40,134
Yeah!

171
00:13:48,408 --> 00:13:50,511
- Yeah!
- Whoo-hoo!

172
00:13:53,313 --> 00:13:55,250
We're beating 'em!

173
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:02,825
- We got 'em!
- Ah, yeah!

174
00:14:08,562 --> 00:14:10,228
What was that?

175
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:12,831
Hold on, I'm gonna
check the back.

176
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:15,434
Keep her straight.

177
00:14:15,436 --> 00:14:18,738
Ah, no. God. She's toast.

178
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,741
OK, forget it.
Fine, you know what?

179
00:14:21,743 --> 00:14:23,575
It's fantastic.

180
00:14:23,577 --> 00:14:25,478
Forget the motor,
forget everything.

181
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,548
This is fantastic. I love it.

182
00:14:34,489 --> 00:14:37,793
Let's go celebrate,
have a glass of champagne!

183
00:14:44,865 --> 00:14:48,968
The 233. It's an exclusive
boat. It's an icon for,

184
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:51,337
for style and speed.

185
00:14:51,339 --> 00:14:55,210
It's the kind of sexy toy
that you can't live without.

186
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:59,712
Well, you close one door
and you open another.

187
00:14:59,714 --> 00:15:02,281
A new company
with a new vision.

188
00:15:02,283 --> 00:15:04,717
<i>We're building boats
that, well, they...</i>

189
00:15:04,719 --> 00:15:06,953
push the envelope
and break barriers.

190
00:15:06,955 --> 00:15:10,488
<i>Daring, defiant, of course,
they're irresistible.</i>

191
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:14,259
If you want to cross the
finish line first, by a Donzi.

192
00:15:14,261 --> 00:15:17,930
<i>It's a glorious day
here where a field of 51 racers stream</i>

193
00:15:17,932 --> 00:15:22,234
<i>full speed ahead from
the starting line in Miami.</i>

194
00:15:22,236 --> 00:15:23,703
<i>And there's Dick Bertram</i>

195
00:15:23,705 --> 00:15:25,537
<i>racing his way
to his usual position</i>

196
00:15:25,539 --> 00:15:27,772
<i>at the front of the pack.</i>

197
00:15:27,774 --> 00:15:29,474
Mr. Aronoff,

198
00:15:29,476 --> 00:15:32,011
tell us about that first
win from Miami to Nassau.

199
00:15:32,013 --> 00:15:33,878
Well if you really
want to win,

200
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,616
sometimes you have to take
a chance, let it all hang out.

201
00:15:36,618 --> 00:15:39,388
As the kids say,
it's gotta be your bag.

202
00:15:47,327 --> 00:15:49,762
<i>As the leaders
approach Nassau, it's Bertram,</i>

203
00:15:49,764 --> 00:15:52,668
<i>Webb, and Ben Aronoff.</i>

204
00:16:07,948 --> 00:16:11,617
<i>The racers make the turn to
clear the outside of the island</i>

205
00:16:11,619 --> 00:16:15,588
<i>and oh, my! That's Aronoff
placing a big bet,</i>

206
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:18,291
<i>risking it all on a shortcut
through the shore,</i>

207
00:16:18,293 --> 00:16:21,263
<i>threading the needle
through the jagged rocks!</i>

208
00:16:55,429 --> 00:16:56,728
<i>Aronoff in the 0-0-7.</i>

209
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,631
- Aronoff!
- Yes!

210
00:16:58,633 --> 00:17:00,969
<i>James Bond himself
has taken the lead!</i>

211
00:17:08,742 --> 00:17:12,280
<i>And no one's gonna
catch him now!</i>

212
00:18:44,605 --> 00:18:46,572
Thank you.

213
00:18:46,574 --> 00:18:47,976
No olives.

214
00:18:55,883 --> 00:18:58,616
Hey, dad!
Hey, dad!

215
00:18:58,618 --> 00:18:59,788
Catch!

216
00:19:00,855 --> 00:19:03,521
Nice spiral, Joe Namath!

217
00:19:03,523 --> 00:19:04,989
Wanna come play with us?

218
00:19:04,991 --> 00:19:07,061
Later. I gotta find your mom.

219
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:11,932
Yeah.

220
00:19:13,867 --> 00:19:15,734
Oh, wonderful of you
to show up.

221
00:19:15,736 --> 00:19:19,071
It got so late last night,
I just stayed at Knocky's.

222
00:19:19,073 --> 00:19:22,141
Yesterday's race,
I think I broke something.

223
00:19:22,143 --> 00:19:24,011
Yes, you did.

224
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,883
Excuse me.

225
00:19:46,733 --> 00:19:49,834
The woman has a tattoo
of Elvis on both thighs,

226
00:19:49,836 --> 00:19:52,770
and she's not convinced
that it looks like Elvis.

227
00:19:52,772 --> 00:19:56,074
So she goes out in the street,
she finds a drunk,

228
00:19:56,076 --> 00:19:58,811
and she lifts up her skirt,
and she says to the drunk

229
00:19:58,813 --> 00:20:00,613
"Do you recognize these guys?"

230
00:20:00,615 --> 00:20:04,517
And the drunk says, "I don't
know who the twins are,

231
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:07,085
but the guy in the middle
is definitely Willie Nelson."

232
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:13,726
I need a drink. A good joke
always makes me thirsty.

233
00:20:13,728 --> 00:20:16,664
Ben, somebody wants to see you.

234
00:20:25,539 --> 00:20:27,739
Mr. Lansky.

235
00:20:27,741 --> 00:20:30,910
<i>Meyer Lansky, the financial
wizard of organized crime.</i>

236
00:20:30,912 --> 00:20:33,711
<i>When he called, you answered.</i>

237
00:20:33,713 --> 00:20:34,979
Ben Aronoff of Sheepshead Bay.

238
00:20:34,981 --> 00:20:36,548
How are ya?

239
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:39,285
- All right. You look good.
- Oh, thanks.

240
00:20:39,287 --> 00:20:42,720
Real good.
I've been keeping up with you.

241
00:20:42,722 --> 00:20:44,289
- Oh?
- Yeah.

242
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:47,559
Our box houses in Jersey
must feel like ages ago

243
00:20:47,561 --> 00:20:50,796
and not nearly as sexy
as those boats of yours.

244
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:52,831
Build boats, build homes,
same thing.

245
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:54,866
- Not according to my nephew.
- Is that right?

246
00:20:54,868 --> 00:20:57,036
He's gaga for those
powerboats of yours.

247
00:20:57,038 --> 00:20:58,036
And those ads.

248
00:21:00,141 --> 00:21:02,240
Hey, Robbie!

249
00:21:02,242 --> 00:21:05,777
<i>That's Robbie Reemer, Meyer
Lansky's little asshole nephew.</i>

250
00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:07,779
Tell us why you
like Ben Aronoff.

251
00:21:07,781 --> 00:21:10,015
Because Ben Aronoff
has everything!

252
00:21:11,719 --> 00:21:13,522
See?

253
00:21:16,824 --> 00:21:19,290
Still remember Jacob,
your father.

254
00:21:19,292 --> 00:21:22,227
He'd be proud of you selling
to that hoity toity crowd.

255
00:21:22,229 --> 00:21:24,766
Making a stir, making a buck.

256
00:21:26,232 --> 00:21:27,536
But on your own?

257
00:21:29,737 --> 00:21:30,971
New beginnings?

258
00:21:32,038 --> 00:21:33,541
That's crap.

259
00:21:34,608 --> 00:21:37,109
Not wanting to be a bother?

260
00:21:37,111 --> 00:21:38,876
More crap.

261
00:21:38,878 --> 00:21:41,246
We're your family, Benny.

262
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,817
These are your people.

263
00:21:45,619 --> 00:21:49,290
Sometimes you just want
to do some things on your own.

264
00:21:52,993 --> 00:21:56,327
You do that when it
comes to banging <i>shiksas</i>

265
00:21:56,329 --> 00:21:58,162
and betting the ponies.

266
00:21:58,164 --> 00:22:00,234
You don't put that
bullshit in front of me.

267
00:22:04,005 --> 00:22:07,275
You ever seen a head all
swelled up? That's you.

268
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:11,043
Not good for a goddamn thing.

269
00:22:11,045 --> 00:22:13,715
Don't remember who you are,
or where you came from.

270
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:33,865
Hey. Are you kidding me?

271
00:22:33,867 --> 00:22:35,366
You know him?
You know Meyer Lansky?

272
00:22:35,368 --> 00:22:37,835
Oh, fuck Lansky!
I've worked too hard, Shelley

273
00:22:37,837 --> 00:22:39,738
for him to come in
the middle of our shit.

274
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:42,176
We've got too many
big things coming in.

275
00:23:57,183 --> 00:23:59,485
<i>Aronoff's
revolutionary Cigarette has taken</i>

276
00:23:59,487 --> 00:24:01,519
<i>offshore powerboat
racing by storm.</i>

277
00:24:01,521 --> 00:24:04,021
<i>At each stop on
the European circuit</i>

278
00:24:04,023 --> 00:24:05,824
<i>the Cigarette has burned
thru the record books</i>

279
00:24:05,826 --> 00:24:09,260
<i>shattering every mark
for time and speed.</i>

280
00:24:09,262 --> 00:24:12,197
<i>A fantastic 66 miles an hour,</i>

281
00:24:12,199 --> 00:24:15,267
<i>13 miles an hour faster than
the record set three years ago.</i>

282
00:24:15,269 --> 00:24:18,804
Boats are sex symbols, and
certainly the Cigarette boat

283
00:24:18,806 --> 00:24:22,277
is a sexy boat, but we
don't market it that way.

284
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:40,124
It's a man's boat, and
it's a dangerous machine.

285
00:24:40,126 --> 00:24:42,193
<i>And there's
Ben Aronoff speeding home</i>

286
00:24:42,195 --> 00:24:45,430
<i>heading towards his seventh
victory this season.</i>

287
00:24:45,432 --> 00:24:49,304
<i>One more, and he reclaims
the world championship.</i>

288
00:25:15,195 --> 00:25:19,832
My husband would like to
purchase two Cigarette boats.

289
00:25:19,834 --> 00:25:22,234
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

290
00:25:22,236 --> 00:25:25,437
Well for you,
I'll have to charge him double.

291
00:25:30,344 --> 00:25:35,046
You know, I would have to come
to America, pick them up.

292
00:25:35,048 --> 00:25:36,416
Could you?

293
00:25:40,487 --> 00:25:44,021
Does it ever get
cold in, uh, Florida?

294
00:25:44,023 --> 00:25:46,357
Very.

295
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:49,961
But I could always
use some warmth

296
00:25:49,963 --> 00:25:53,433
of the... Tuscan... sun.

297
00:25:55,869 --> 00:25:58,970
Hey, Ben.

298
00:25:58,972 --> 00:26:01,105
Shelley?

299
00:26:01,107 --> 00:26:02,407
I've been lookin'
all over for ya.

300
00:26:02,409 --> 00:26:05,309
- Who is this man?
- He's my lawyer.

301
00:26:05,311 --> 00:26:06,947
We gotta talk.

302
00:26:09,016 --> 00:26:12,220
I'll be back. Don't you go.

303
00:26:16,557 --> 00:26:20,424
Now I didn't volunteer,
OK, to run your office,

304
00:26:20,426 --> 00:26:24,296
your business and your family,
for Christ sake.

305
00:26:24,298 --> 00:26:26,364
I'm just a lawyer, remember?

306
00:26:26,366 --> 00:26:29,200
You flew 3,000 miles
to complain?

307
00:26:29,202 --> 00:26:31,569
What are you doing here, Ben?

308
00:26:31,571 --> 00:26:33,572
What are you running
away from? Lansky?

309
00:26:33,574 --> 00:26:35,539
I'm busting my ass
for our company.

310
00:26:35,541 --> 00:26:38,209
Oh, oh, OK. Yeah, right.
I can see that.

311
00:26:38,211 --> 00:26:40,511
Winning races
sells boats, Shelley.

312
00:26:40,513 --> 00:26:42,381
Do you throw in the sex with every sale
or do they gotta pay for that, too?

313
00:26:42,383 --> 00:26:44,181
You better watch
your fuckin' mouth.

314
00:26:44,183 --> 00:26:46,384
Oh, good. Great. Rip me
to shreds, Ben, because then

315
00:26:46,386 --> 00:26:50,557
there will be absolutely
nobody running your company.

316
00:26:52,326 --> 00:26:53,928
I'm sorry.

317
00:26:54,929 --> 00:26:56,297
Yeah.

318
00:26:58,598 --> 00:27:00,332
I'm gonna win the
world championship

319
00:27:00,334 --> 00:27:02,500
at the end of
this month, Shelley.

320
00:27:02,502 --> 00:27:05,038
That's big. It's very big.

321
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,942
Mazel tov.

322
00:27:11,144 --> 00:27:13,312
By the way,
your son just got into college.

323
00:27:13,314 --> 00:27:15,016
He's leaving in a week.

324
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:19,351
I just thought
you'd like to know.

325
00:27:19,353 --> 00:27:21,623
I'll see you back in Florida.

326
00:28:31,157 --> 00:28:34,459
<i>But while I was
winning championships</i>

327
00:28:34,461 --> 00:28:38,063
<i>I was losing something
far more important.</i>

328
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,478
Kathy.

329
00:28:57,084 --> 00:28:58,553
Andrew.

330
00:28:59,819 --> 00:29:03,087
He damaged his spine...
in the car accident.

331
00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:04,725
He's in surgery now.

332
00:29:06,226 --> 00:29:08,196
They say he may not make it.

333
00:29:11,664 --> 00:29:14,132
Don't worry.
We'll get this right.

334
00:29:14,134 --> 00:29:16,604
We will get this right.

335
00:29:48,434 --> 00:29:52,173
Andy, you gotta
fight through this.

336
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,243
You need to stick around.

337
00:29:57,644 --> 00:30:01,715
You're an Aronoff.
We fight back. We battle.

338
00:30:04,218 --> 00:30:05,851
OK, this is the deal.

339
00:30:05,853 --> 00:30:08,553
You're gonna get through this,
you're gonna get better,

340
00:30:08,555 --> 00:30:10,658
and you're gonna
walk the hell outta here.

341
00:30:12,358 --> 00:30:14,095
You hear me?

342
00:30:17,597 --> 00:30:20,465
I'm gonna be here
all night with you, OK?

343
00:30:20,467 --> 00:30:24,169
I'll be right here. I'm gonna
sleep right there on the couch.

344
00:30:24,171 --> 00:30:27,674
I'm not going anywhere.
OK? Dad's back.

345
00:30:32,278 --> 00:30:34,082
Dad's back.

346
00:30:37,151 --> 00:30:38,419
Baby boy.

347
00:31:07,181 --> 00:31:10,382
Your son had to
almost lose his life

348
00:31:10,384 --> 00:31:12,819
to get his father's attention.

349
00:31:15,888 --> 00:31:18,625
What do the rest
of us have to do?

350
00:31:22,828 --> 00:31:24,796
Come on.

351
00:31:24,798 --> 00:31:26,299
Come on.

352
00:31:49,957 --> 00:31:53,261
- You got a lot of friends, Ben.
- Do I?

353
00:32:01,934 --> 00:32:03,770
How is he? How's Andrew?

354
00:32:06,573 --> 00:32:09,442
They told me he'll
never walk again.

355
00:32:13,913 --> 00:32:16,183
Oh, God.

356
00:32:18,652 --> 00:32:21,385
I mean, he's here
though, right?

357
00:32:21,387 --> 00:32:24,722
He's a tough kid.
He'll battle back.

358
00:32:24,724 --> 00:32:28,328
Kathy and I are through. Done.

359
00:32:29,429 --> 00:32:31,265
A long time ago, Ben.

360
00:32:33,567 --> 00:32:36,770
So how are we doing?

361
00:32:40,007 --> 00:32:41,605
What do you mean?
Business-wise?

362
00:32:41,607 --> 00:32:43,708
- Yes.
- Oh.

363
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:45,509
No, I'm not talking
about that right now.

364
00:32:45,511 --> 00:32:46,844
Oh, yes you are, Shelley.

365
00:32:46,846 --> 00:32:48,646
Actually, no, I'm not.

366
00:32:48,648 --> 00:32:50,914
Just tell me how are we doing?
What are the numbers?

367
00:32:50,916 --> 00:32:52,319
Just tell me.

368
00:32:54,488 --> 00:32:56,421
Look, it's not like every
time you win a race

369
00:32:56,423 --> 00:32:59,356
they gave you a million bucks,
which is half of what it costs

370
00:32:59,358 --> 00:33:02,262
to run the racing team across
Europe for the summer.

371
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:08,533
To be honest, we can't sell
enough hulls a year

372
00:33:08,535 --> 00:33:10,834
to keep the company afloat,
not the way we're running it.

373
00:33:10,836 --> 00:33:12,807
We're in a deep hole, Ben.

374
00:33:20,446 --> 00:33:24,815
Well, I'll fix it.

375
00:33:24,817 --> 00:33:26,319
Like I always do.

376
00:33:47,507 --> 00:33:50,342
<i>I knew where I had to go</i>

377
00:33:50,344 --> 00:33:53,478
<i>and he was waiting for me.</i>

378
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,014
<i>I thought I got out,</i>

379
00:33:56,016 --> 00:33:57,951
<i>but you never get out.</i>

380
00:34:34,721 --> 00:34:36,456
Great to see you, Ben.

381
00:34:48,001 --> 00:34:51,372
<i>Someone else
was waiting for me, too.</i>

382
00:35:03,516 --> 00:35:06,617
Hell of a day out there, champ.

383
00:35:06,619 --> 00:35:09,052
But they're still
running the horses at noon.

384
00:35:09,054 --> 00:35:14,425
So what do you say
we burn a grand or two

385
00:35:14,427 --> 00:35:17,130
and remember what
real beer tastes like?

386
00:35:20,065 --> 00:35:22,599
Andy?

387
00:35:22,601 --> 00:35:26,704
I'm telling ya, feeling sorry
for yourself ain't gonna work.

388
00:35:26,706 --> 00:35:30,678
You gotta get out there, boy.
You gotta live again.

389
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:36,083
Come on, buddy. Let's go out.
Let's go out to the track.

390
00:35:39,585 --> 00:35:41,521
OK, that's it.

391
00:35:45,659 --> 00:35:47,528
I fuckin' hate you!

392
00:36:03,476 --> 00:36:05,112
Well, I love you.

393
00:36:22,695 --> 00:36:24,095
What do I see?

394
00:36:24,097 --> 00:36:26,264
I see a smile?

395
00:36:26,266 --> 00:36:29,032
You know you're
still fucking crazy?

396
00:36:29,034 --> 00:36:31,735
Yeah. I know that.

397
00:36:31,737 --> 00:36:33,139
Now let's go to the track.

398
00:36:34,574 --> 00:36:36,577
<i>And they're off!</i>

399
00:36:38,077 --> 00:36:39,577
Here we go! Here we go!

400
00:36:39,579 --> 00:36:43,146
Here we go!
Come on! Come on!

401
00:36:43,148 --> 00:36:48,253
Do it! Five! Come on!
Five! Come on!

402
00:36:48,255 --> 00:36:52,624
- You got this!
- Do it! Do it! Do it!

403
00:36:52,626 --> 00:36:54,525
Five! Come on!

404
00:36:54,527 --> 00:36:57,862
Yes! There it is! Look, look!
Look, look, look! We got it!

405
00:36:57,864 --> 00:36:59,264
Yes! Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah!

406
00:36:59,266 --> 00:37:01,666
Bring it home! Woo!

407
00:37:01,668 --> 00:37:03,804
- That's it, baby!
- We got it!

408
00:37:06,206 --> 00:37:08,742
Come on, five!

409
00:37:15,181 --> 00:37:17,849
Whoo-hoo!

410
00:37:17,851 --> 00:37:20,985
Two wins today, buddy. Not bad.

411
00:37:20,987 --> 00:37:23,054
You like it?

412
00:37:23,056 --> 00:37:25,188
Yeah, what's not to like?
It was fun.

413
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:29,626
You know, I got a line on a
big stable up North in Ocala.

414
00:37:29,628 --> 00:37:31,195
What do you say we buy it?

415
00:37:31,197 --> 00:37:33,331
We fill it with thoroughbreds,

416
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:36,668
and you run
the whole damn thing.

417
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:39,070
I don't know anything
about horses, dad.

418
00:37:39,072 --> 00:37:42,710
I didn't know anything about
boats or building houses.

419
00:37:44,811 --> 00:37:48,845
See this? See that?

420
00:37:48,847 --> 00:37:50,648
That was my whole year's salary

421
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:53,083
when I was a gym teacher
in Brooklyn.

422
00:37:53,085 --> 00:37:54,885
How do you think I did that?

423
00:37:54,887 --> 00:37:56,688
How do you think
I made that happen?

424
00:37:56,690 --> 00:38:00,594
I busted my ass, and
I beat the fuckin' odds.

425
00:38:01,695 --> 00:38:02,963
So can you.

426
00:38:05,364 --> 00:38:09,601
- You really think so?
- I know so.

427
00:38:09,603 --> 00:38:13,003
<i>I was never really there
for him, but I wanted to buy him</i>

428
00:38:13,005 --> 00:38:18,011
<i>some happiness, and he took
that money... and ran.</i>

429
00:38:23,382 --> 00:38:24,751
<i>Coño.</i>

430
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:33,594
Top-of-the-line model.

431
00:38:37,664 --> 00:38:40,668
- How much?
- Retail, 32K.

432
00:38:41,768 --> 00:38:44,605
- You'll take 35?
- 45.

433
00:38:52,746 --> 00:38:56,179
Fuck it.
We take together, pair.

434
00:38:56,181 --> 00:39:00,019
- Say, 80K.
- 100K.

435
00:39:10,929 --> 00:39:12,929
OK.

436
00:39:12,931 --> 00:39:14,331
Ah.

437
00:39:14,333 --> 00:39:16,099
Deal.

438
00:39:16,101 --> 00:39:18,168
What do you want
the title to be?

439
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:21,405
Pick a name.
A good one.

440
00:39:21,407 --> 00:39:24,675
Nobody wants to explain
where the cash came from.

441
00:39:24,677 --> 00:39:28,081
- Come with me.
- I like this guy.

442
00:39:39,893 --> 00:39:42,860
<i>And just like their
drug sniffing dogs,</i>

443
00:39:42,862 --> 00:39:44,862
<i>once the DEA got the scent,</i>

444
00:39:44,864 --> 00:39:46,333
<i>they were hard to shake.</i>

445
00:39:47,367 --> 00:39:49,032
Mr. Aronoff!

446
00:39:49,034 --> 00:39:51,204
Stuart Lopez, DEA.

447
00:39:53,172 --> 00:39:54,371
Nice boat!

448
00:39:54,373 --> 00:39:57,275
I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

449
00:39:57,277 --> 00:39:59,110
Office.

450
00:39:59,112 --> 00:40:00,914
I'll see you there.

451
00:40:04,451 --> 00:40:07,351
Look, no surprise to you,
Mr. Aronoff.

452
00:40:07,353 --> 00:40:10,487
Cigarette boats are a big hit
on the drug-running circuit.

453
00:40:10,489 --> 00:40:13,157
Lately, we busted a lot of
smugglers driving your boats.

454
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:14,791
My boats?

455
00:40:14,793 --> 00:40:16,427
I mean, boats manufactured
by your company.

456
00:40:16,429 --> 00:40:18,463
Ah, yes.

457
00:40:18,465 --> 00:40:20,363
The problem is the
sales names are fiction

458
00:40:20,365 --> 00:40:22,800
and the hull numbers
don't make any sense.

459
00:40:22,802 --> 00:40:24,101
We sell boats.

460
00:40:24,103 --> 00:40:25,470
They're registered,
re-registered,

461
00:40:25,472 --> 00:40:27,738
sold and resold.
And by the way,

462
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:31,909
the resale value
is through the fucking roof.

463
00:40:31,911 --> 00:40:34,778
Do you record the hull numbers
associated with each purchase?

464
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:38,215
Now you know, and I know,
that it's illegal

465
00:40:38,217 --> 00:40:40,751
not to record those numbers, so

466
00:40:40,753 --> 00:40:42,854
where are you going with this?

467
00:40:42,856 --> 00:40:44,789
Just doing our job,
Mr. Aronoff.

468
00:40:44,791 --> 00:40:47,258
You know, catching bad guys.

469
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:50,862
OK, so do you go
to Smith and Wesson

470
00:40:50,864 --> 00:40:53,463
every time you haul
someone in with a gun?

471
00:40:53,465 --> 00:40:55,465
Look, I make boats.
Fast boats.

472
00:40:55,467 --> 00:40:59,804
People want them. They come
in here, I take their ID,

473
00:40:59,806 --> 00:41:03,273
they pay me money and boom,
they are standing

474
00:41:03,275 --> 00:41:07,345
in the cockpit of a speedboat.
A very sexy speedboat.

475
00:41:07,347 --> 00:41:08,945
So what do you want me to do?

476
00:41:08,947 --> 00:41:10,514
To chase them down
and fingerprint them?

477
00:41:10,516 --> 00:41:13,351
We'd put you on our
payroll if you did.

478
00:41:15,487 --> 00:41:17,323
That's good.

479
00:41:34,873 --> 00:41:37,143
- Whoa, watch out.
- Out of the road!

480
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:46,550
Make sure you get
the name right.

481
00:41:46,552 --> 00:41:49,056
I'm Robbie fuckin' Reemer!

482
00:41:53,025 --> 00:41:55,325
<i>With the feds closing
in on him,</i>

483
00:41:55,327 --> 00:41:57,894
<i>Meyer Lansky fled to Israel,</i>

484
00:41:57,896 --> 00:42:00,831
<i>but Israel's welcome to
all Jews from anywhere</i>

485
00:42:00,833 --> 00:42:05,471
<i>did not include him, and
he was forced back to Miami.</i>

486
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:13,079
Hey, Ben. Come.

487
00:42:21,487 --> 00:42:25,021
Meyer, welcome back.
How are ya?

488
00:42:25,023 --> 00:42:26,324
Ben.

489
00:42:30,128 --> 00:42:33,331
They tell me that you made
all the payments back to me.

490
00:42:33,333 --> 00:42:36,333
Yes. Almost six months ago.

491
00:42:36,335 --> 00:42:38,068
We've just been
rolling them out.

492
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:41,606
You know, it's a...
Business booming and it's...

493
00:42:41,608 --> 00:42:45,876
It's like everyone and their
brother wants a speedboat.

494
00:42:45,878 --> 00:42:47,246
Here, let me get that.

495
00:42:51,516 --> 00:42:53,085
Yeah, it's good.

496
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:01,161
You self-satisfied
little prick.

497
00:43:06,565 --> 00:43:08,268
You took the money, Ben.

498
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:14,137
You took the fuckin' money!

499
00:43:14,139 --> 00:43:17,277
You didn't borrow it
from Household Finance!

500
00:43:19,045 --> 00:43:21,278
You don't think that I got
other things to worry about?

501
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,680
Besides Ben Aronoff and his
little fuckin' boat business?

502
00:43:23,682 --> 00:43:25,983
Meyer. Meyer, please.

503
00:43:25,985 --> 00:43:27,485
You know I'm grateful,

504
00:43:27,487 --> 00:43:29,619
and you also know
I went to great lengths to...

505
00:43:29,621 --> 00:43:31,390
Stop!

506
00:43:36,228 --> 00:43:38,965
We are growing our
operations on the seas.

507
00:43:40,065 --> 00:43:42,566
You're clean and that helps.

508
00:43:42,568 --> 00:43:45,101
Don't play dumb.

509
00:43:45,103 --> 00:43:46,670
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

510
00:43:46,672 --> 00:43:49,206
Now there is a big
difference between

511
00:43:49,208 --> 00:43:52,709
what we had agreed upon and
what you're implying here.

512
00:43:52,711 --> 00:43:55,315
You'll do your fuckin' part!

513
00:44:04,389 --> 00:44:07,425
- Hey, champ.
- Hey.

514
00:44:07,427 --> 00:44:08,929
I got a fucking name!

515
00:44:11,297 --> 00:44:13,530
You remember me, right?

516
00:44:13,532 --> 00:44:16,502
Because Ben Aronoff
has everything.

517
00:44:17,603 --> 00:44:19,737
Meyer's nephew.

518
00:44:19,739 --> 00:44:21,505
Meyer's nephew?

519
00:44:21,507 --> 00:44:24,075
You're not?

520
00:44:24,077 --> 00:44:26,209
I'm racing now!
You better watch out!

521
00:44:26,211 --> 00:44:28,479
Oh yeah?
We'll be lookin' for ya.

522
00:44:58,077 --> 00:44:59,479
Good to see ya.

523
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:03,115
I gotta see it.

524
00:45:12,791 --> 00:45:15,325
We're good?

525
00:45:15,327 --> 00:45:17,998
Yeah, we're good.
It's this way.

526
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:27,204
1.5 tons.

527
00:45:27,206 --> 00:45:29,039
Now that's what
I'm talking about.

528
00:45:29,041 --> 00:45:32,112
- Boys, get to work.
- Yes, sir.

529
00:45:40,052 --> 00:45:41,721
Woo!

530
00:45:43,088 --> 00:45:45,588
It tastes stronger
every day, man.

531
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:48,325
Hey boss! You want some?

532
00:45:48,327 --> 00:45:49,696
Yeah, pass it over here!

533
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:53,563
Some fuckin' good weed!

534
00:45:53,565 --> 00:45:55,365
<i>See if you see him.
He's coming at you. Late model C.</i>

535
00:45:55,367 --> 00:45:57,168
Yeah, we
got eyes on him right now.

536
00:45:57,170 --> 00:46:01,137
Here he comes. Here he comes.
Everybody set?

537
00:46:01,139 --> 00:46:02,740
- Yes, sir. All set.
- All set. All set.

538
00:46:02,742 --> 00:46:06,677
Go! Go! Go!

539
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:09,246
- Fuck!
- Oh, shit! Fuck!

540
00:46:09,248 --> 00:46:10,514
<i>This is the Coast Guard!</i>

541
00:46:10,516 --> 00:46:14,021
<i>Stop your boat!
Stop your boat!</i>

542
00:46:31,536 --> 00:46:33,336
Oh, man!

543
00:46:33,338 --> 00:46:35,171
You OK? You OK?

544
00:46:35,173 --> 00:46:36,807
Shit! Brad looks bad!

545
00:46:36,809 --> 00:46:38,445
Grab the wheel!

546
00:46:41,646 --> 00:46:43,349
You're gonna be OK!

547
00:46:47,586 --> 00:46:49,056
Move!

548
00:46:51,623 --> 00:46:54,760
<i>Pick him up!
Pick him up!</i>

549
00:47:10,175 --> 00:47:11,842
Need some repairs, champ.

550
00:47:11,844 --> 00:47:13,844
I got some holes in her,

551
00:47:13,846 --> 00:47:15,681
and I want you
to take care of it.

552
00:47:23,155 --> 00:47:25,688
No. We don't do
those kind of repairs.

553
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:27,657
I'm sure you do.

554
00:47:27,659 --> 00:47:31,228
As a matter of fact,
I know you do.

555
00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:32,896
And while you're at it, how
about you put some of them

556
00:47:32,898 --> 00:47:35,566
custom seat stitching you've
been doing on the new ones?

557
00:47:35,568 --> 00:47:39,336
I'd really like that.
And when you're done,

558
00:47:39,338 --> 00:47:41,472
you can run the bill
over to my uncle.

559
00:47:41,474 --> 00:47:43,474
Let me ask you something.

560
00:47:43,476 --> 00:47:45,778
Did your uncle teach
you how to swim?

561
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,927
Let's get a drink. Come on.

562
00:48:03,929 --> 00:48:05,563
This is so fun being
with you, Ben.

563
00:48:05,565 --> 00:48:08,532
- Manhattan, two cherries?
- Let's do champagne.

564
00:48:08,534 --> 00:48:10,302
Champagne!

565
00:48:11,836 --> 00:48:13,503
Are they getting younger, champ

566
00:48:13,505 --> 00:48:15,472
or are you just getting
more distinguished?

567
00:48:15,474 --> 00:48:17,941
Do you really want to start this
with your best-paying client?

568
00:48:17,943 --> 00:48:20,911
I'm not starting anything.

569
00:48:20,913 --> 00:48:23,414
- You are the famous boat racer?
- Yes.

570
00:48:23,416 --> 00:48:25,215
Yes.

571
00:48:25,217 --> 00:48:27,650
So shall I call you
"The Animal?"

572
00:48:27,652 --> 00:48:28,888
Yes.

573
00:48:32,391 --> 00:48:34,394
You can call me, "The Animal."

574
00:48:43,702 --> 00:48:46,403
- Your majesty.
- King Hussein of Jordan?

575
00:48:46,405 --> 00:48:48,875
Now you know this is the spot!

576
00:48:57,315 --> 00:49:01,420
<i>And oh, my God,
she walked in.</i>

577
00:49:16,869 --> 00:49:18,538
I've known him for years.

578
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:21,373
I'll be right back.

579
00:49:26,846 --> 00:49:28,347
How's my favorite king?

580
00:49:30,782 --> 00:49:33,516
You didn't realize?
I stopped speaking to you

581
00:49:33,518 --> 00:49:35,885
after you sold those
Donzis to the Israelis,

582
00:49:35,887 --> 00:49:37,887
and they turned them
into torpedo boats.

583
00:49:37,889 --> 00:49:40,691
Anything to beat
the damn Arabs.

584
00:49:40,693 --> 00:49:42,726
Still the same Ben.

585
00:49:42,728 --> 00:49:44,494
My friends.

586
00:49:44,496 --> 00:49:48,065
You can't say "Miami"
without saying Ben Aronoff.

587
00:49:48,067 --> 00:49:51,869
And this lovely creature
is Emily Gowen.

588
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:53,670
My pleasure.

589
00:49:53,672 --> 00:49:58,008
I lure her from New York to
come slum with us on the beach.

590
00:49:58,010 --> 00:50:00,447
I wouldn't call it that,
Your Highness.

591
00:50:02,347 --> 00:50:05,585
Emily, how are you?

592
00:51:48,753 --> 00:51:51,755
Last night at The Jockey Club,
this motherfucker came up to me

593
00:51:51,757 --> 00:51:53,891
and said, "Get down
to your warehouse right now."

594
00:51:53,893 --> 00:51:56,193
So I dump my date,
I speed down,

595
00:51:56,195 --> 00:51:58,961
I open up the fucking gates,
and bam!

596
00:51:58,963 --> 00:52:01,965
There are two boats pulling
up, filled with marijuana.

597
00:52:01,967 --> 00:52:06,603
They take that shit through my
warehouse, put 'em on trucks,

598
00:52:06,605 --> 00:52:07,737
and this is what we get.

599
00:52:07,739 --> 00:52:10,974
This is how you
go to jail, man.

600
00:52:10,976 --> 00:52:13,209
Ben, what are we doin' here?

601
00:52:13,211 --> 00:52:16,079
This is Lansky saying,
"Do your bit!"

602
00:52:16,081 --> 00:52:18,949
And on top of that, he wants
me to fly down to the Caymans

603
00:52:18,951 --> 00:52:22,753
and make deposits
on their money.

604
00:52:22,755 --> 00:52:24,854
That's not my biggest problem.

605
00:52:24,856 --> 00:52:26,623
You know anything
about Emily Gowen?

606
00:52:26,625 --> 00:52:28,492
- You gotta be kidding me, right?
- No.

607
00:52:28,494 --> 00:52:30,726
Besides the fact that she's
King Hussein's girlfriend?

608
00:52:30,728 --> 00:52:33,063
Shelley, he's got
two fuckin' wives.

609
00:52:33,065 --> 00:52:37,900
And bodyguards, and an
enormous bankroll, and an army.

610
00:52:37,902 --> 00:52:41,173
Please. Just get me
the number, will ya?

611
00:52:53,018 --> 00:52:56,186
Hey! Hey, Emily!

612
00:52:56,188 --> 00:52:58,992
There's a guy up there says
he wants to talk to you.

613
00:53:14,706 --> 00:53:16,606
I didn't know what to bring,

614
00:53:16,608 --> 00:53:19,108
but I saw that you drank this
the other night at the club.

615
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:22,147
You're nothing if not
persistent, Ben Aronoff.

616
00:53:23,916 --> 00:53:25,782
I got your calls.

617
00:53:25,784 --> 00:53:28,655
Examine a man's faults,
you'll find his virtues.

618
00:53:36,195 --> 00:53:39,795
I have some stuff to do.
You're welcome to come along.

619
00:53:39,797 --> 00:53:42,032
Thank you.

620
00:53:42,034 --> 00:53:45,735
So have you been
riding since you were a kid?

621
00:53:45,737 --> 00:53:47,670
That's all I lived for.

622
00:53:47,672 --> 00:53:50,209
Until my mother
threw me into modeling.

623
00:53:52,110 --> 00:53:54,043
Have you ever been on a horse?

624
00:53:55,847 --> 00:53:58,148
I have a tough enough time
staying on a boat.

625
00:53:58,150 --> 00:54:01,784
No horses, but I do
like horse races.

626
00:54:01,786 --> 00:54:04,755
- Yeah, me too.
- Yeah.

627
00:54:04,757 --> 00:54:07,590
There's nothing like it
when they're really running

628
00:54:07,592 --> 00:54:10,961
and turning for home. It is
the best 20 seconds on Earth.

629
00:54:10,963 --> 00:54:13,664
Yeah. The sound
of those hooves and

630
00:54:13,666 --> 00:54:19,336
the muscle and grit.
It's amazing. It's truth.

631
00:54:19,338 --> 00:54:21,170
Yeah.

632
00:54:21,172 --> 00:54:24,340
Marlboro, he's my favorite, so
I always make time to feed him.

633
00:54:24,342 --> 00:54:27,276
If he had his way,
he'd bust right outta here

634
00:54:27,278 --> 00:54:28,878
and just keep running, right?

635
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,081
I know how you feel, Marlboro.

636
00:54:31,083 --> 00:54:33,650
May I feed him? May I?

637
00:54:33,652 --> 00:54:35,288
Here, let me try.

638
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:38,988
There you go. Oops.

639
00:54:38,990 --> 00:54:41,224
Let me try again.
Here you go.

640
00:54:41,226 --> 00:54:44,764
Here. There you go. Wow.

641
00:54:48,067 --> 00:54:50,967
You're pretty comfortable
around a horse.

642
00:54:50,969 --> 00:54:52,938
You sure you
haven't been on one?

643
00:54:54,206 --> 00:54:58,545
- You're a natural.
- Nah. I wouldn't say that.

644
00:55:07,952 --> 00:55:10,653
It's gonna get worse.

645
00:55:10,655 --> 00:55:12,923
Hey, there's no shame
in sitting this one out.

646
00:55:12,925 --> 00:55:14,858
Half the field's
already dropped.

647
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:16,626
Really?

648
00:55:16,628 --> 00:55:20,063
You know, I knew a guy once,
looked a lot like you.

649
00:55:20,065 --> 00:55:23,266
He said, "I'll never get
tired of this shit!"

650
00:55:23,268 --> 00:55:24,971
- Come on.
- Yeah.

651
00:55:55,233 --> 00:55:56,268
Oh.

652
00:55:59,137 --> 00:56:03,141
I'm no sailor, but those
dark clouds can't be good.

653
00:56:04,809 --> 00:56:08,311
Do they have rain-outs
like they do in baseball?

654
00:56:08,313 --> 00:56:10,079
Let me explain, sweetheart.

655
00:56:10,081 --> 00:56:13,215
In the glorious sport of
offshore powerboat racing,

656
00:56:13,217 --> 00:56:16,019
you take the beating
of a lifetime for hours,

657
00:56:16,021 --> 00:56:19,222
there's no one there to cheer
you on, and if you get hurt,

658
00:56:19,224 --> 00:56:22,925
which Ben does every single
race, you can't quit.

659
00:56:22,927 --> 00:56:26,128
You gotta just keep going
until you see land.

660
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:28,164
That's good to know, Mr. Katz,

661
00:56:28,166 --> 00:56:30,367
that the chances of Ben standing
me up on this date are...

662
00:56:30,369 --> 00:56:36,238
Zero to none. OK? And would
ya please call me Shelley?

663
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,878
OK. Shelley.

664
00:56:51,289 --> 00:56:53,789
<i>I've got Ben Aronoff up front.</i>

665
00:56:53,791 --> 00:56:56,194
<i>Brassfield coming up in second.</i>

666
00:56:57,896 --> 00:56:59,429
<i>And there's Robbie Reemer</i>

667
00:56:59,431 --> 00:57:02,402
<i>fighting the waves
and keeping it close.</i>

668
00:57:05,070 --> 00:57:08,271
<i>And there's Brassfield!
He's making a run!</i>

669
00:57:08,273 --> 00:57:10,977
<i>Oh, he crashed!
Brassfield crashed!</i>

670
00:57:12,376 --> 00:57:16,014
Circle back! Circle back!
We're gonna need a rescue!

671
00:57:37,335 --> 00:57:38,837
This is suicide!

672
00:57:40,239 --> 00:57:42,972
Come on. Come on. Come on.

673
00:57:42,974 --> 00:57:46,411
Oh, come on! Get over there!

674
00:57:52,885 --> 00:57:55,421
We're turning the fuck around!

675
00:58:00,958 --> 00:58:03,395
- We're the last one left!
- Keep going!

676
00:58:08,065 --> 00:58:09,900
- We can still turn!
- No!

677
00:58:09,902 --> 00:58:14,570
Full throttle!
Full throttle!

678
00:58:14,572 --> 00:58:16,808
We can make it!

679
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:30,922
Yeah?

680
00:58:34,159 --> 00:58:36,525
Yeah, OK.

681
00:58:36,527 --> 00:58:38,864
Well, keep me posted.

682
00:58:49,608 --> 00:58:52,945
All boats accounted for,
except for Ben's.

683
00:58:55,514 --> 00:58:57,847
It's been over six hours.

684
00:58:57,849 --> 00:59:00,819
If he was gonna make it,
he'd be here by now.

685
00:59:03,956 --> 00:59:08,894
I hardly know him...
or knew him.

686
00:59:12,463 --> 00:59:16,501
But he gets to you, your Ben.

687
00:59:49,166 --> 00:59:52,137
He made it!
He made it!

688
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:57,039
He made it!
He made it!

689
01:00:49,728 --> 01:00:51,628
Hey Robbie!

690
01:00:51,630 --> 01:00:55,731
I just heard Ben Aronoff made
it to Nassau, won the race.

691
01:00:55,733 --> 01:00:58,069
Just thought you'd
want to know.

692
01:02:40,338 --> 01:02:43,572
<i>This is Channel
Three News at Six.</i>

693
01:02:43,574 --> 01:02:47,409
The new administration's War on
Drugs on full display tonight.

694
01:02:47,411 --> 01:02:50,780
DEA Special Agent Lopez
at the Miami Field Office.

695
01:02:50,782 --> 01:02:53,550
We're sending a message.
The hunt is on.

696
01:02:53,552 --> 01:02:55,351
No matter who, where or how,

697
01:02:55,353 --> 01:02:58,153
we'll cut off the flow of
illegal drugs into our country.

698
01:02:58,155 --> 01:03:00,557
This represents just
one night of action.

699
01:04:03,621 --> 01:04:05,521
Welcome to
World Choice Island Bank.

700
01:04:05,523 --> 01:04:06,757
Follow me.

701
01:04:10,628 --> 01:04:12,163
This way.

702
01:04:13,597 --> 01:04:15,400
We'll use the vault.

703
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:32,485
Divide it evenly
among these 10 accounts.

704
01:04:34,719 --> 01:04:37,420
No problem.
Pleasure to have your business.

705
01:04:37,422 --> 01:04:39,458
Looking forward
to have much more.

706
01:04:41,425 --> 01:04:43,328
Yes.

707
01:04:45,730 --> 01:04:49,666
You're supposed to eat
your food, not wear it.

708
01:04:49,668 --> 01:04:51,400
You work late,
and I don't want to wake you.

709
01:04:51,402 --> 01:04:54,771
- It's OK.
- Morning.

710
01:04:54,773 --> 01:04:57,507
Morning.
Bobo. Bo.

711
01:04:59,844 --> 01:05:01,547
I'll be home early.

712
01:05:07,385 --> 01:05:10,452
<i>Our goal is
to break the power of the mob</i>

713
01:05:10,454 --> 01:05:12,822
<i>in America and
nothing short of it.</i>

714
01:05:12,824 --> 01:05:15,825
<i>We mean to end their profits,
imprison their members</i>

715
01:05:15,827 --> 01:05:19,262
<i>and cripple
their organizations.</i>

716
01:05:21,398 --> 01:05:24,333
<i>If anyone doubts what federal,
state and local authorities</i>

717
01:05:24,335 --> 01:05:26,702
<i>working with the support
of the people can achieve,</i>

718
01:05:26,704 --> 01:05:31,307
<i>let them come to South Florida, and
see here what we've seen today.</i>

719
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:13,016
<i>Meyer Lansky
is the reputed crime boss</i>

720
01:06:13,018 --> 01:06:15,651
<i>who was once said to have
boasted, "We are bigger</i>

721
01:06:15,653 --> 01:06:18,920
<i>than U.S. steel," but today,
dead at the age of 81,</i>

722
01:06:18,922 --> 01:06:23,394
<i>Lansky was buried in a Miami
cemetery in a plain coffin.</i>

723
01:06:26,563 --> 01:06:28,331
I don't like it, Shelley.

724
01:06:28,333 --> 01:06:30,700
I still have mud on my shoes
from Lansky's funeral.

725
01:06:30,702 --> 01:06:34,003
That's 36 hours ago. Why?
Why this meeting?

726
01:06:34,005 --> 01:06:35,771
Hey, it's just a
courtesy, all right?

727
01:06:35,773 --> 01:06:38,474
We're gonna sit down with him.
We're in, we're out.

728
01:06:38,476 --> 01:06:41,543
- Hey. Hey, Al.
- Shelley!

729
01:06:41,545 --> 01:06:43,548
- Ben.
- Hey.

730
01:06:45,617 --> 01:06:46,986
OK.

731
01:06:52,891 --> 01:06:56,492
I want to keep this short.
Our company, Comanche

732
01:06:56,494 --> 01:07:00,530
is building a new plant
on Thunderboat Alley.

733
01:07:00,532 --> 01:07:03,733
Really?
Have you bought the land yet?

734
01:07:03,735 --> 01:07:05,635
That's why we're all here.

735
01:07:05,637 --> 01:07:08,470
Well good. So why don't you
just put a proposal together,

736
01:07:08,472 --> 01:07:13,642
present it to Shelley,
and I'll review it. Simple.

737
01:07:13,644 --> 01:07:15,411
Good. Let's go.

738
01:07:15,413 --> 01:07:17,016
Sit down, Ben.

739
01:07:18,650 --> 01:07:21,387
This is bullshit,
and you know it.

740
01:07:22,387 --> 01:07:24,519
Hey, hey, no,
Ben. Ben, Ben.

741
01:07:24,521 --> 01:07:25,987
- What?
- Let's come to peace.

742
01:07:25,989 --> 01:07:28,893
For you. That's it.
What? What is it?

743
01:07:31,496 --> 01:07:36,132
Here's the proposal. Only
it's not really a proposal.

744
01:07:36,134 --> 01:07:38,737
You're gonna give us the land.

745
01:07:40,672 --> 01:07:42,537
Al's gonna take care
of the deed,

746
01:07:42,539 --> 01:07:45,541
you and your lawyer pal here
are gonna sign it. And then,

747
01:07:45,543 --> 01:07:48,577
we're gonna build our own boat
factory right down the street.

748
01:07:48,579 --> 01:07:51,613
We'll be neighbors.
Now won't that be great?

749
01:07:51,615 --> 01:07:54,851
You're fucking crazy.
Come on! Jesus Christ!

750
01:07:54,853 --> 01:07:56,985
We're gonna throw a big
fuckin' block party, Ben!

751
01:07:56,987 --> 01:07:58,954
- Good!
- You're invited!

752
01:07:58,956 --> 01:08:01,124
Motherfuckers!

753
01:08:01,126 --> 01:08:03,626
It's just dirt, Ben. What do you care?
You're not using it anyway.

754
01:08:03,628 --> 01:08:04,927
You know how much money
they're making.

755
01:08:04,929 --> 01:08:06,528
Why do they have to rip me off?

756
01:08:06,530 --> 01:08:08,597
You're making
a lot of money too, buddy.

757
01:08:08,599 --> 01:08:11,133
And you're rich enough
to not give a damn.

758
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:13,068
Besides, that kid is sloppy.
All right?

759
01:08:13,070 --> 01:08:15,037
He's all over the place.

760
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:17,473
He'll be back in prison before you
know it, while you, my friend,

761
01:08:17,475 --> 01:08:19,976
have a new company to run.
USA Racing, baby.

762
01:08:19,978 --> 01:08:21,846
I'll call you tomorrow.

763
01:08:30,421 --> 01:08:31,821
Safe flight, buddy.

764
01:08:31,823 --> 01:08:33,856
I can't believe this, Shelley.
Last run.

765
01:08:33,858 --> 01:08:36,528
I'm with you.
Last run for me, too!

766
01:08:38,462 --> 01:08:40,365
Last time, Shelley!

767
01:09:10,094 --> 01:09:11,794
Ha-ha! Big Ben!

768
01:09:11,796 --> 01:09:13,161
Mister Vice President.

769
01:09:13,163 --> 01:09:14,930
Oh, go tell it to the Marines.

770
01:09:14,932 --> 01:09:16,699
I'm happy with just
plain old George.

771
01:09:16,701 --> 01:09:17,767
I'm happy with Ben.

772
01:09:19,103 --> 01:09:20,635
- How are ya?
- How are you?

773
01:09:20,637 --> 01:09:22,604
This is Nick Brady.
He's a long-time friend.

774
01:09:22,606 --> 01:09:25,007
He runs a big bank in
New York... Dillon Read.

775
01:09:25,009 --> 01:09:26,608
Oh, well.

776
01:09:26,610 --> 01:09:27,843
I've been hearing
loads about you, too,

777
01:09:27,845 --> 01:09:29,044
'cause George
is always bragging.

778
01:09:29,046 --> 01:09:30,513
Is that right?

779
01:09:30,515 --> 01:09:31,813
You need someone
to manage your millions.

780
01:09:31,815 --> 01:09:33,049
Nick runs a pretty good outfit.

781
01:09:33,051 --> 01:09:34,483
- I'll keep that in mind.
- Yeah.

782
01:09:34,485 --> 01:09:36,552
- Is that it?
- That's it.

783
01:09:36,554 --> 01:09:38,754
- Come.
- Holy smokes.

784
01:09:38,756 --> 01:09:40,555
Hey, what do you think
of the jacket?

785
01:09:40,557 --> 01:09:43,159
You look like a...
like a boat racer.

786
01:09:43,161 --> 01:09:45,794
- Barbara thinks I look silly.
- How is Barbara?

787
01:09:45,796 --> 01:09:47,530
She's doing great. Thank you.

788
01:09:47,532 --> 01:09:49,764
Well, it certainly passes
the eye test.

789
01:09:49,766 --> 01:09:51,200
Mm-hmm.

790
01:09:51,202 --> 01:09:52,501
What are you gonna
call this one?

791
01:09:52,503 --> 01:09:53,835
Blue Thunder.

792
01:09:53,837 --> 01:09:55,571
- Blue Thunder.
- Blue Thunder.

793
01:09:55,573 --> 01:09:57,507
- Let's take her for a ride.
- Yeah, let's do it.

794
01:10:34,912 --> 01:10:38,214
Santa Anita, big race
track on the West Coast.

795
01:10:38,216 --> 01:10:40,982
And that's Gypsy Red winning
the Breeders Cup last spring.

796
01:10:40,984 --> 01:10:43,553
I remember. My source.

797
01:10:43,555 --> 01:10:45,321
Trained here at Ocala Stables.

798
01:10:45,323 --> 01:10:47,889
- Over 500 horses now.
- It's beautiful.

799
01:10:47,891 --> 01:10:49,724
Lansky's place,
if we ever prove it.

800
01:10:49,726 --> 01:10:51,697
That's right.
We're getting there.

801
01:10:52,796 --> 01:10:54,664
The Tricycle Club
in California,

802
01:10:54,666 --> 01:10:55,964
legalized card gambling.

803
01:10:55,966 --> 01:10:57,732
Bought for 30 million
a year ago,

804
01:10:57,734 --> 01:11:00,035
and now worth five times that.

805
01:11:00,037 --> 01:11:01,903
What do they all
have in common?

806
01:11:01,905 --> 01:11:04,607
Bought with loans by the same
bank in Liechtenstein.

807
01:11:04,609 --> 01:11:06,008
Same forms, even.

808
01:11:06,010 --> 01:11:08,777
Liechtenstein.
Jesus, secrecy laws there.

809
01:11:08,779 --> 01:11:09,880
Hit the lights.

810
01:11:11,716 --> 01:11:14,317
This is the Isle of Man,
just off the coast of England.

811
01:11:14,319 --> 01:11:17,119
The money to Liechtenstein
comes from here.

812
01:11:17,121 --> 01:11:20,589
And this man is
singing like a canary.

813
01:11:20,591 --> 01:11:22,924
And has the bank records
to back it up.

814
01:11:22,926 --> 01:11:26,262
- Now where's the trail start?
- It starts here.

815
01:11:26,264 --> 01:11:29,365
Deposit in the Cayman Islands
to a whole host of companies.

816
01:11:29,367 --> 01:11:32,701
But it's dope cash rolling in
every day by the wheelbarrow.

817
01:11:32,703 --> 01:11:34,669
Half a billion dollars
last year alone.

818
01:11:34,671 --> 01:11:35,905
All cash.

819
01:11:35,907 --> 01:11:37,973
Here's how we think
it lays out.

820
01:11:37,975 --> 01:11:41,343
From our investigation,
a large network.

821
01:11:41,345 --> 01:11:45,046
Nice family.
Who's the guy on top?

822
01:11:45,048 --> 01:11:48,086
That right there,
that's Robbie Reemer.

823
01:11:51,288 --> 01:11:54,725
What is this? "Let's
snuff out the Cigarette."

824
01:11:56,994 --> 01:11:58,960
George Bush.

825
01:11:58,962 --> 01:12:02,231
We are pleased to place
an initial order

826
01:12:02,233 --> 01:12:04,834
for 100 Blue Thunder
catamarans.

827
01:12:04,836 --> 01:12:06,968
Forget the royals
and the celebs.

828
01:12:06,970 --> 01:12:08,870
We just got us some
government money!

829
01:12:08,872 --> 01:12:14,110
Sincerely, William Van Raab,
Commissioner U.S. Coast Guard.

830
01:12:14,112 --> 01:12:18,414
Ten million dollars!
Couldn't get any richer!

831
01:12:18,416 --> 01:12:20,849
Well break out
the fuckin' champagne!

832
01:12:20,851 --> 01:12:23,919
- Come on, buddy!
- We did it!

833
01:12:23,921 --> 01:12:25,321
- Yeah.
- U.S.A.-Rizzy, baby!

834
01:12:25,323 --> 01:12:26,688
I gotta call. I gotta...

835
01:12:35,198 --> 01:12:37,799
I can't believe it.

836
01:12:37,801 --> 01:12:40,835
A fleet of my catamarans

837
01:12:40,837 --> 01:12:42,705
protecting the coastal waters

838
01:12:42,707 --> 01:12:44,343
of these United States.

839
01:12:45,842 --> 01:12:47,876
What'cha doin', bo-boo?

840
01:12:47,878 --> 01:12:51,446
Oh, you don't have a chance.
This is the Coast Guard.

841
01:12:51,448 --> 01:12:53,351
We're driving the Blue Thunder.

842
01:12:54,819 --> 01:12:58,289
I am so proud of you,
Ben Aronoff.

843
01:13:02,894 --> 01:13:05,160
Not bad for the
son of an immigrant

844
01:13:05,162 --> 01:13:07,062
from Sheepshead Bay, huh?

845
01:13:07,064 --> 01:13:10,299
Hm, no. No, not bad at all.

846
01:13:10,301 --> 01:13:12,802
Now you,
you coulda done better.

847
01:13:12,804 --> 01:13:16,071
You could have had
that King of Jordan.

848
01:13:16,073 --> 01:13:17,942
You are my king.

849
01:13:19,010 --> 01:13:22,681
Shelley! Shelley!

850
01:13:25,983 --> 01:13:27,319
Shelley!

851
01:13:33,791 --> 01:13:34,993
Hey, Ben.

852
01:13:39,197 --> 01:13:41,867
I need your help on something.

853
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:45,137
Right there.

854
01:14:01,051 --> 01:14:03,785
I'm not gonna sign over
Blue Thunder to you.

855
01:14:03,787 --> 01:14:05,086
You arrogant piece of shit.

856
01:14:05,088 --> 01:14:06,224
Ah!

857
01:14:21,338 --> 01:14:24,305
Do you think you're
different than us? Huh?

858
01:14:24,307 --> 01:14:25,840
Something better?

859
01:14:25,842 --> 01:14:27,509
Something special?

860
01:14:27,511 --> 01:14:30,012
You're just another guppy
in the food chain.

861
01:14:30,014 --> 01:14:32,984
Sign! Sign now!

862
01:14:45,296 --> 01:14:48,934
You're property, Ben.
All you've ever been.

863
01:15:00,511 --> 01:15:01,847
Sign.

864
01:15:50,528 --> 01:15:52,494
Good morning!

865
01:15:52,496 --> 01:15:55,097
Headed to the office.

866
01:15:55,099 --> 01:15:56,531
You don't have to sleep
in the guest room

867
01:15:56,533 --> 01:15:58,170
when you get home
late at night.

868
01:15:59,537 --> 01:16:01,870
It makes me feel unwanted.

869
01:16:01,872 --> 01:16:05,376
I didn't want to wake you.
I love you.

870
01:16:15,453 --> 01:16:17,352
You know the Blue Thunder deal?

871
01:16:17,354 --> 01:16:20,589
All that hoopla about catching
bad guys with better boats?

872
01:16:20,591 --> 01:16:22,424
I just got off with customs,

873
01:16:22,426 --> 01:16:24,226
and they've been asked to make

874
01:16:24,228 --> 01:16:28,330
checks payable to a new
company: Super Chief South.

875
01:16:28,332 --> 01:16:30,101
Robbie Reemer
owns that company.

876
01:16:32,168 --> 01:16:34,202
So you're telling me the biggest
dope smuggler in the country

877
01:16:34,204 --> 01:16:36,371
is in charge of building the
boats intended to catch 'em?

878
01:16:38,609 --> 01:16:41,910
I thought the Blue Thunder
contract went out to Ben Aronoff.

879
01:16:41,912 --> 01:16:46,984
Yeah, it did.
An old friend.

880
01:17:09,974 --> 01:17:12,911
Please. Sit.

881
01:17:28,559 --> 01:17:30,625
No reason to coat this, Ben,

882
01:17:30,627 --> 01:17:33,661
but our Dade County guys tell
us the Feds are digging around,

883
01:17:33,663 --> 01:17:35,263
looking into everything.

884
01:17:35,265 --> 01:17:37,700
Dope running, money,
the whole operation.

885
01:17:37,702 --> 01:17:40,268
A Grand Jury's collecting evidence
faster than we can clock it.

886
01:17:40,270 --> 01:17:45,107
It's bad. And it's moving
right up our asses.

887
01:17:45,109 --> 01:17:50,079
So you're all
personally suspects?

888
01:17:50,081 --> 01:17:51,714
Some fuckin' banker in Europe

889
01:17:51,716 --> 01:17:56,151
is ratting us all the fuck out
for a fuckin' plea deal.

890
01:17:56,153 --> 01:17:58,390
So what do you want me to do?

891
01:18:00,658 --> 01:18:05,294
How about some
basic co-operation?

892
01:18:05,296 --> 01:18:08,696
- Really?
- Really.

893
01:18:08,698 --> 01:18:11,099
You know what? You better
bring your fuckin' goons here

894
01:18:11,101 --> 01:18:13,634
'cause I'll cut your
fuckin' heart out.

895
01:18:13,636 --> 01:18:16,638
Get this asshole outta here,
or this meeting ends!

896
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:20,709
I'm not kidding!
Get him out! Get out!

897
01:18:20,711 --> 01:18:24,248
Fuckin' handle this.
Handle this!

898
01:18:33,791 --> 01:18:38,027
Look, Ben...

899
01:18:38,029 --> 01:18:40,461
We need to put some assets
back under your name,

900
01:18:40,463 --> 01:18:43,065
back under the purview
of your companies.

901
01:18:43,067 --> 01:18:47,305
Remove it from the Feds'
reach... for a period.

902
01:18:49,573 --> 01:18:54,108
You guys are precious. You
really, really are precious.

903
01:18:54,110 --> 01:18:55,376
This is serious, Ben.

904
01:18:55,378 --> 01:18:56,680
Hm.

905
01:19:00,184 --> 01:19:03,117
Fuck it. Move the assets.

906
01:19:03,119 --> 01:19:06,187
But you put every single one
of them in my name

907
01:19:06,189 --> 01:19:08,057
not my company's name.

908
01:19:08,059 --> 01:19:10,491
And then, good luck
on getting them back.

909
01:19:10,493 --> 01:19:12,628
Nobody's winning here, Ben.

910
01:19:12,630 --> 01:19:15,363
We're just talking
about surviving.

911
01:19:15,365 --> 01:19:17,633
This is bigger than you,

912
01:19:17,635 --> 01:19:20,768
or Robbie, or fuckin' anyone.

913
01:19:20,770 --> 01:19:25,275
Well guess what?
It ain't my problem.

914
01:19:42,725 --> 01:19:45,195
What have you got us into?

915
01:19:47,597 --> 01:19:48,733
He has a gun.

916
01:19:50,367 --> 01:19:54,335
- Where's Willie?
- He's in his room.

917
01:19:54,337 --> 01:19:59,309
You go to him. You go to him.

918
01:20:06,716 --> 01:20:09,420
Nice place. Nice family.

919
01:20:10,453 --> 01:20:12,356
I hate to see you lose it all.

920
01:20:14,692 --> 01:20:16,592
Now it's my family?

921
01:20:16,594 --> 01:20:20,129
You're gonna get subpoenaed,

922
01:20:20,131 --> 01:20:23,132
and all kinds of people
are worried about it.

923
01:20:23,134 --> 01:20:25,804
Worried about
what you're gonna say.

924
01:20:27,404 --> 01:20:32,374
But I tell them, I'm sure
old Ben's gonna play ball.

925
01:20:32,376 --> 01:20:34,242
He's on the team.

926
01:20:34,244 --> 01:20:37,446
That is what
teammates do, right?

927
01:20:37,448 --> 01:20:38,679
Get out.

928
01:20:38,681 --> 01:20:41,351
- Get the fuck outta here.
- Good luck.

929
01:20:46,356 --> 01:20:49,461
- You've been warned, Ben.
- Get the fuck out.

930
01:20:53,163 --> 01:20:56,598
Tell me something.
You owe me something.

931
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:58,700
I have to get you out of here.

932
01:20:58,702 --> 01:21:01,402
I want you to get on the phone and
call your sister in New York,

933
01:21:01,404 --> 01:21:02,670
and tell her that
you're on the way.

934
01:21:02,672 --> 01:21:04,772
- Just do that.
- What is going on?

935
01:21:04,774 --> 01:21:08,210
I will tell you everything when
you get to New York. I promise.

936
01:21:08,212 --> 01:21:09,911
I am scared.

937
01:21:09,913 --> 01:21:13,882
I am scared for you.
I am scared for all of us.

938
01:21:13,884 --> 01:21:16,186
Don't be. Don't be.

939
01:21:18,555 --> 01:21:23,925
- I love you.
- God. I love you, too.

940
01:21:23,927 --> 01:21:25,529
OK.

941
01:21:37,408 --> 01:21:40,409
Now listen. Listen.
Listen to me.

942
01:21:40,411 --> 01:21:42,678
We're gonna be fine.
I'll call your sister

943
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:45,513
with the number where
you can reach me. OK?

944
01:21:45,515 --> 01:21:47,648
I'll call you when I get in.

945
01:21:47,650 --> 01:21:49,887
OK. OK.
Go, go. Go.

946
01:22:04,568 --> 01:22:07,338
Slow down.
Slow down. Take it easy.

947
01:22:20,384 --> 01:22:22,317
Don't alarm her.

948
01:22:22,319 --> 01:22:24,756
Plenty of time before
we get to the causeway.

949
01:23:14,805 --> 01:23:17,406
Stay with her.

950
01:23:17,408 --> 01:23:19,978
Go, go, go, go.
Don't let her go too far.

951
01:24:12,429 --> 01:24:13,861
- Emily.
- <i>Hey.</i>

952
01:24:13,863 --> 01:24:16,764
Oh, thank God. Hey, babe.

953
01:24:16,766 --> 01:24:18,834
<i>You're safe? No problems?</i>

954
01:24:18,836 --> 01:24:21,535
Yeah. Yeah,
William's already in bed,

955
01:24:21,537 --> 01:24:25,008
and Aunt Cynthia's
been incredible.

956
01:24:26,676 --> 01:24:28,977
Except, I think I forgot
what winter was like.

957
01:24:28,979 --> 01:24:33,548
Yeah, man. Oh, I used
to hate Jersey winters.

958
01:24:33,550 --> 01:24:36,518
Well, it's pretty here.
You should come.

959
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:37,986
<i>I can't, babe.</i>

960
01:24:37,988 --> 01:24:42,523
You know,
I can't put you guys at risk.

961
01:24:42,525 --> 01:24:44,461
So are you gonna tell me?

962
01:24:46,829 --> 01:24:48,763
OK, look.

963
01:24:48,765 --> 01:24:52,968
Over the years, I did business
with a lot of shady guys, OK?

964
01:24:52,970 --> 01:24:56,437
And I stepped on some toes.

965
01:24:56,439 --> 01:24:58,639
I don't know what that means.

966
01:24:58,641 --> 01:25:02,611
It means that I made promises to
people that I can no longer keep,

967
01:25:02,613 --> 01:25:06,180
<i>and it's come back to haunt me.</i>

968
01:25:06,182 --> 01:25:07,682
The guy in the living room?

969
01:25:07,684 --> 01:25:09,683
The guy in the
living room is just

970
01:25:09,685 --> 01:25:11,719
one of a whole line of people

971
01:25:11,721 --> 01:25:14,856
<i>going all the way back to
my days in New Jersey.</i>

972
01:25:14,858 --> 01:25:18,826
The mob?

973
01:25:18,828 --> 01:25:21,099
OK, babe, listen.

974
01:25:23,434 --> 01:25:26,468
There is a big court case.

975
01:25:26,470 --> 01:25:28,469
A lot of people
are gonna go down,

976
01:25:28,471 --> 01:25:33,442
<i>and the Feds are pushing hard
on everyone, including me.</i>

977
01:25:33,444 --> 01:25:35,009
So...

978
01:25:35,011 --> 01:25:39,880
So you and me, our lives,
it's just all been one big lie?

979
01:25:39,882 --> 01:25:41,616
Babe, don't say that.

980
01:25:41,618 --> 01:25:45,085
When I fuckin' saw you,
I dropped to my knees.

981
01:25:45,087 --> 01:25:47,688
You fuckin' stoned me.

982
01:25:47,690 --> 01:25:50,494
<i>You're the one
who cleared up my life.</i>

983
01:25:52,695 --> 01:25:53,794
Then run.

984
01:25:53,796 --> 01:25:55,897
I can't do that now, babe.

985
01:25:55,899 --> 01:25:57,699
<i>I'm a fighter too, Ben.</i>

986
01:25:57,701 --> 01:26:00,137
If you're in a fight,
I wanna be right at your side.

987
01:26:03,172 --> 01:26:05,106
Just hang in there.

988
01:26:05,108 --> 01:26:08,977
<i>Hang in there for me, baby.</i>

989
01:26:08,979 --> 01:26:10,148
I love you.

990
01:26:30,801 --> 01:26:32,203
Yeah?

991
01:26:33,703 --> 01:26:35,637
Hey.

992
01:26:35,639 --> 01:26:37,074
Uh-huh.

993
01:26:38,175 --> 01:26:40,241
Uh-huh.

994
01:26:40,243 --> 01:26:41,612
Where?

995
01:26:44,180 --> 01:26:46,049
What's the name?

996
01:26:58,194 --> 01:27:01,196
OK, Dutch. It's a straight
shot down to 75.

997
01:27:01,198 --> 01:27:04,266
It's a little bend in Orlando, but
we don't change highways, so...

998
01:27:04,268 --> 01:27:06,904
- OK.
- Yeah. Take it easy.

999
01:27:08,171 --> 01:27:13,775
- Hey. Come on.
- What? No tickets.

1000
01:27:13,777 --> 01:27:17,812
- No tickets.
- No tickets.

1001
01:27:17,814 --> 01:27:21,616
- No tickets!
- Yeah, no tickets.

1002
01:27:23,319 --> 01:27:26,224
- That means the cops are...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember.

1003
01:28:02,859 --> 01:28:07,128
- Morning.
- Morning. Agent...?

1004
01:28:07,130 --> 01:28:09,363
- Lopez.
- Ah.

1005
01:28:09,365 --> 01:28:13,000
- It's been a while, hasn't it?
- Yes.

1006
01:28:13,002 --> 01:28:15,769
A couple of gumbahs wound up
in the ER last night.

1007
01:28:15,771 --> 01:28:18,272
Smashed into by a Ford Bronco.

1008
01:28:18,274 --> 01:28:21,612
Thought you might know
something about it.

1009
01:28:23,846 --> 01:28:26,615
I, uh, I ran your plates.

1010
01:28:26,617 --> 01:28:30,151
Put the word out,
called around, and bingo.

1011
01:28:30,153 --> 01:28:32,887
It's kinda weird to find a
Mercedes in this parking lot.

1012
01:28:32,889 --> 01:28:35,223
Although, more likely
to find Robbie Reemer

1013
01:28:35,225 --> 01:28:36,991
with a couple of hookers.

1014
01:28:36,993 --> 01:28:41,196
- What do you want?
- I'm just curious.

1015
01:28:41,198 --> 01:28:43,732
You know, I really am, 'cause

1016
01:28:43,734 --> 01:28:45,066
your name keeps popping up

1017
01:28:45,068 --> 01:28:48,370
all over this big-ass
investigation.

1018
01:28:48,372 --> 01:28:50,104
You know,

1019
01:28:50,106 --> 01:28:52,040
a guy who was friends
with kings and queens, and

1020
01:28:52,042 --> 01:28:55,977
goddamn Vice-President,
sells his multi-million-dollar

1021
01:28:55,979 --> 01:28:58,946
government contract
to a mobbed up hustler?

1022
01:28:58,948 --> 01:29:02,652
- It's just business.
- Just business?

1023
01:29:04,688 --> 01:29:07,988
Look, you know, I read this
book once by a Jewish guy.

1024
01:29:07,990 --> 01:29:10,892
He said, "People who
have a <i>why</i> to live

1025
01:29:10,894 --> 01:29:13,294
can bear almost anything."

1026
01:29:13,296 --> 01:29:15,429
What's your <i>why</i>, Ben?

1027
01:29:15,431 --> 01:29:17,432
Let me tell you something.

1028
01:29:17,434 --> 01:29:21,902
Sometimes, it doesn't matter
who you are or what you have.

1029
01:29:21,904 --> 01:29:26,007
It's just too hard to say no.

1030
01:29:26,009 --> 01:29:28,742
Do you have a plan? 'Cause
you're in with a rough crowd.

1031
01:29:28,744 --> 01:29:33,080
You can help us,
and we can help you.

1032
01:29:33,082 --> 01:29:37,451
Water's calmed down, we just
gotta stay in the boat.

1033
01:29:37,453 --> 01:29:39,153
Hang on.

1034
01:29:39,155 --> 01:29:40,988
That's a risky bet.

1035
01:29:40,990 --> 01:29:43,324
I've been winning with it
my whole life.

1036
01:29:43,326 --> 01:29:47,898
Now if you're not going to
arrest me, you have a nice day.

1037
01:30:01,978 --> 01:30:05,179
Hey buddy, there he is.

1038
01:30:05,181 --> 01:30:08,883
Secret rendezvous on the beach.

1039
01:30:08,885 --> 01:30:10,287
Black.

1040
01:30:12,421 --> 01:30:14,888
I spoke to my buddy
at the D.A.'s office.

1041
01:30:14,890 --> 01:30:17,424
They won't confirm anything.

1042
01:30:17,426 --> 01:30:19,727
On the other hand, they would
have told me to take a hike

1043
01:30:19,729 --> 01:30:21,731
if the subpoena wasn't coming.

1044
01:30:22,998 --> 01:30:24,732
If it's typed, it's ripe.

1045
01:30:24,734 --> 01:30:26,901
You're getting served,
buddy-o, tomorrow.

1046
01:30:28,505 --> 01:30:33,107
- That's actually great news.
- Really? How's that?

1047
01:30:33,109 --> 01:30:35,210
Once you get served,
they'll keep you safe.

1048
01:30:35,212 --> 01:30:37,778
The Reemers, whoever,
they're not gonna touch you

1049
01:30:37,780 --> 01:30:39,313
once that happens.

1050
01:30:39,315 --> 01:30:42,483
They'll bring the feds
and the Miami-Date P.D.

1051
01:30:42,485 --> 01:30:44,952
Dirty as they are,
no one wants that.

1052
01:30:44,954 --> 01:30:47,988
25 years of your giving
me high-end advice,

1053
01:30:47,990 --> 01:30:52,893
and it all boils down to "Stick
around 'til you get served."

1054
01:30:52,895 --> 01:30:54,495
That's the ticket.

1055
01:30:54,497 --> 01:30:57,902
Here's something: now
you're involved in this, too.

1056
01:31:03,006 --> 01:31:06,241
All right, I'll tell you what.
Head back to your office,

1057
01:31:06,243 --> 01:31:08,343
grab your cash,
anything you want,

1058
01:31:08,345 --> 01:31:12,045
meet me at the Hollywood Marina,
we'll take my boat and just...

1059
01:31:12,047 --> 01:31:15,415
just disappear for the day.
All right? We'll wait it out.

1060
01:31:15,417 --> 01:31:20,457
Just two good ol' boys
gone fishing. Sounds good.

1061
01:31:38,274 --> 01:31:42,509
Millie, it's me. Anyone there
I should know about?

1062
01:31:42,511 --> 01:31:44,978
<i>Nothing moving
but the waves, Ben.</i>

1063
01:31:44,980 --> 01:31:46,282
Good.

1064
01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:53,080
Can I help you?

1065
01:32:53,082 --> 01:32:55,083
I'm lookin', uh,

1066
01:32:55,085 --> 01:32:57,518
for Ben Aronoff.

1067
01:32:57,520 --> 01:32:58,620
I'm afraid he's not in.

1068
01:32:58,622 --> 01:33:00,057
Huh.

1069
01:33:01,891 --> 01:33:03,590
I've been trying to
reach him for a week,

1070
01:33:03,592 --> 01:33:05,526
but he hasn't
gotten back to me.

1071
01:33:05,528 --> 01:33:08,998
I call, and I call, and I call.

1072
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:14,568
Now look, my boss is
a very wealthy man

1073
01:33:14,570 --> 01:33:17,906
who wants to buy a boat.

1074
01:33:17,908 --> 01:33:19,674
And he wants to buy the boat

1075
01:33:19,676 --> 01:33:21,442
before he goes back
to Michigan. Now, look,

1076
01:33:21,444 --> 01:33:24,111
I'm just trying to give
this man some money.

1077
01:33:24,113 --> 01:33:25,248
I'm Ben.

1078
01:33:26,649 --> 01:33:28,348
Why don't you bring
your boss in,

1079
01:33:28,350 --> 01:33:29,918
we'll show him some boats,

1080
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:31,552
and he can see what he likes.

1081
01:33:31,554 --> 01:33:34,289
My boss...

1082
01:33:34,291 --> 01:33:36,691
took me from the gutter.

1083
01:33:36,693 --> 01:33:39,326
Gave me a job.

1084
01:33:39,328 --> 01:33:44,065
Everything I have,
everything I am, I owe to him.

1085
01:33:44,067 --> 01:33:46,203
I'd do anything for my boss.

1086
01:33:47,337 --> 01:33:52,040
Anything... and everything.

1087
01:33:52,042 --> 01:33:55,379
I'd never turn my back
on my boss.

1088
01:33:58,213 --> 01:34:01,484
You tell your boss
that I'm done.

1089
01:34:03,052 --> 01:34:06,454
I don't owe anybody anything.

1090
01:34:06,456 --> 01:34:09,493
I'm paid in full and more so.

1091
01:34:10,961 --> 01:34:11,960
You tell him that.

1092
01:34:11,962 --> 01:34:14,094
I'll tell him.

1093
01:34:14,096 --> 01:34:16,332
I'll tell him every word.

1094
01:35:22,431 --> 01:35:23,567
Hey, Ben.

1095
01:36:31,501 --> 01:36:35,870
<i>I'm Ben Aronoff.
I was on top of the world.</i>

1096
01:36:35,872 --> 01:36:40,508
<i>I loved, I created, I won.</i>

1097
01:36:40,510 --> 01:36:42,742
<i>It was one hell of a race.</i>

1098
01:36:42,744 --> 01:36:46,280
<i>Internationally-known
race boat designer Don Aronow</i>

1099
01:36:46,282 --> 01:36:48,583
<i>was shot to death
this afternoon outside...</i>

1100

1101

1102
01:36:53,622 --> 01:36:55,455
<i>...the Godfather, that is him.
You could call him</i>

1103
01:36:55,457 --> 01:36:57,892
<i>the Henry Ford of Powerboats.
He is the man...</i>

1104
01:36:57,894 --> 01:36:59,660
<i>...starting up and developing</i>

1105
01:36:59,662 --> 01:37:01,728
