1
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:13,665
Shoot!

2
00:02:15,436 --> 00:02:16,602
No!

3
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:17,903
I didn't mean shoot.

4
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:19,771
I mean, like, shoot.

5
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:21,773
I gave him my gun.
Excuse me, miss.

6
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:24,743
Is this man bothering you?

7
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:26,612
Who are you?

8
00:02:26,614 --> 00:02:27,880
Super Nerd?

9
00:02:27,882 --> 00:02:30,349
Ed.

10
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:31,850
Ed Gruberman.

11
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:33,485
Gruber-Man?

12
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,754
What are you going to do?

13
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:36,655
Gruberize me?

14
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,158
Don't worry, Gruber-Man.

15
00:02:39,894 --> 00:02:42,161
I can take care of this.

16
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:50,369
What do we have here?

17
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,639
You can call me Red.

18
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:54,740
No kidding.

19
00:02:54,742 --> 00:02:56,341
Uh, the mugger's right.

20
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,610
We can definitely come up
with a better name for you.

21
00:02:58,612 --> 00:02:59,811
Quiet!

22
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:00,913
Don't you see

23
00:03:00,915 --> 00:03:02,848
that I'm working here?

24
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:16,962
Aah!

25
00:03:16,964 --> 00:03:20,732
One, two, three, four... Wow.

26
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:26,705
Hey! Who did this to you? Huh?

27
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:29,274
Speak up. Who are we suing?

28
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:32,411
Gruber-Man, superhero.

29
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:36,715
Bingo. Oh, bingo!

30
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,917
Another case
of superhero abuse.

31
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,385
Oh-ho!

32
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:41,753
You're going to be rich.

33
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:44,389
But I'm going to be richer.

34
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,857
Ha-ha!

35
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:47,292
So how you doing?
You feeling all right?

36
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:49,228
You're all right. Uh-huh.

37
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,697
I wonder how much that window's
going to cost, though.

38
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:54,366
Because you are going
to pay for that, jackass.

39
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:55,400
- Huh?
- Huh?

40
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,636
You've got some nerve.
Gee, thanks.

41
00:03:57,638 --> 00:03:59,271
You know, you're not
so bad yourself, Red.

42
00:03:59,273 --> 00:04:01,607
Or should I call you
My Lady in Red?

43
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:03,642
I told you
I could've handled it.

44
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:05,410
How dare you interfere
in my affairs!

45
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,879
I have half a mind
to burn you to a crisp.

46
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:10,749
On the other hand,

47
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,031
you are kind of cute.

48
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:21,860
Cops! I was never here.

49
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:24,429
Oh, I...

50
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:28,000
Gruberman.

51
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:30,902
Wow. You guys got here fast.

52
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:33,305
We saw it all on YouTube.

53
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,707
Our boys will take you down to the
Great Superheroes Hall of Justice

54
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:36,842
on charges of using
your superpowers

55
00:04:36,844 --> 00:04:38,443
to assault an innocent citizen.

56
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:39,695
"Innocent citizen"?

57
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:40,946
Whoa, I don't think so, guys.

58
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:42,447
Ask her...

59
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:43,815
Ask who?

60
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:45,550
Sh-She was right here. Yeah.

61
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:47,853
She had red beams
that shot out of her eyes.

62
00:04:47,855 --> 00:04:50,555
No, seriously! Red! Tell
it to the judge. Come on.

63
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:52,424
Red! Officer!

64
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:54,459
Red!

65
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,762
Ow! Ow!

66
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:58,497
Ow!

67
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:07,058
<i>So there I was,</i>

68
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,745
<i>about to knock a guy</i>
<i>into the outfield...</i>

69
00:07:09,746 --> 00:07:12,431
<i>my finest moment... only to be
hauled off to jail for it.</i>

70
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:14,599
<i>Later, I realized that this</i>

71
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,119
<i>was the pivotal moment</i>
<i>of my life.</i>

72
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,638
<i>But for you to understand, maybe I
should show you how I got here.</i>

73
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,441
<i>Up until then, I had spent my life
employed as a wannabe superhero...</i>

74
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:23,608
Oh!

75
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,127
<i>...posing for pictures</i>

76
00:07:25,128 --> 00:07:26,645
<i>and showing up</i>
<i>to movie premieres,</i>

77
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:30,115
<i>and, uh, delivering</i>
<i>singing telegrams.</i>

78
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:35,487
¶¶

79
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:38,590
¶ I'm your superhero
to save the day ¶

80
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:40,091
¶ Ta-da ¶

81
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:47,232
<i>As you've probably</i>
<i>noticed by now,</i>

82
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:49,935
<i>I'm not your typical superhero.</i>

83
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:51,703
<i>But for some reason...</i>

84
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:55,006
<i>call it destiny</i>
<i>or divine intervention...</i>

85
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:57,976
<i>I chose not to take off my
costume that fateful evening.</i>

86
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:05,584
Mr. Gruberman,
after reviewing your case,

87
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:11,523
I find you undoubtedly guilty

88
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:14,926
of viciously assaulting the
plaintiff with a two-by-four.

89
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:17,596
You have brought dishonor
to all superheroes.

90
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:22,767
May it please the court...

91
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:25,103
Your Honor, this case
makes me ashamed

92
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:26,671
to be an American.

93
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:29,241
I mean, what has
this country become

94
00:08:29,243 --> 00:08:32,677
when a good, hard-working
citizen like my client,

95
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,212
trying to make
an honest living,

96
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:36,114
only to be brutally attacked

97
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:39,050
in the middle of the night
by this supposed, uh,

98
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:42,120
cape-wearing... superhero?

99
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:44,089
Is it not bad enough
that we have to watch

100
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:46,157
sequel after sequel

101
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,993
of their horrible movies?

102
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:51,263
I mean, imagine my client
having to go to his three...

103
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:53,798
I mean five... I mean seven...

104
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,133
...seven children
and having to explain

105
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:57,168
his poor facial
disfigurement... Uh, Your...

106
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,004
...when he was an ugly man
to begin with.

107
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:00,739
He was mugging Red! Objection!

108
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:01,806
He was not, Your Honor.

109
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:03,141
That is a comic book
fantasy of his.

110
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:06,645
I mean, no one even
names themselves Red.

111
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:07,746
Sustained.

112
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:09,581
Sustained? Sustained!

113
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,082
All we have to go on
is this video

114
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:14,019
that doesn't show
this Red person at the scene.

115
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:21,593
Bailiff, knock it off!

116
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:22,727
God!

117
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:27,198
It's the plaintiff's word
against yours.

118
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,650
Mm-hmm.

119
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,101
Now, do you have anything
to say in your defense?

120
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:31,636
Anything at all?

121
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:34,739
Hi.

122
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:40,211
Yes, I do, Your Honor.

123
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:45,050
I had a very unusual childhood.

124
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:48,186
My parents were Mort
and Peggy Gruberman,

125
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:51,122
<i>tightrope artists</i>
<i>for a traveling circus.</i>

126
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:54,025
<i>I was actually born</i>
<i>during one of their shows.</i>

127
00:09:58,365 --> 00:10:01,099
<i>Mom and Dad tried to instill</i>
<i>two strong values:</i>

128
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,201
<i>One was to always</i>
<i>go to church...</i>

129
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:05,036
<i>...no matter where I was.</i>

130
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:06,488
<i>The other was to make sure</i>

131
00:10:06,489 --> 00:10:07,939
<i>that we never missed</i>
<i>an episode...</i>

132
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,609
<i>...of our hero,</i>
<i>the Dark Winged Vesper.</i>

133
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:12,694
<i>He was on orphaned hero</i>
<i>among heroes.</i>

134
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,778
<i>No superpowers, just a normal
human being... Help me!</i>

135
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:15,914
<i>...fighting for</i>
<i>the good of mankind.</i>

136
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,248
<i>Is there not a heroic gentleman</i>

137
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:21,252
<i>who's willing to save</i>
<i>a poor girl...</i>

138
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:23,088
<i>Like the Dark Winged Vesper,</i>

139
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:26,725
<i>I, too, lost my parents</i>
<i>in a mysterious accident.</i>

140
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:28,326
<i>They were performing</i>
<i>a routine stunt,</i>

141
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:31,096
<i>one they had done</i>
<i>hundreds of times before.</i>

142
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:33,198
<i>My mom did a somersault</i>
<i>in the air,</i>

143
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,166
<i>and my dad caught her while
holding on to the tightrope</i>

144
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:38,103
<i>with only his toes.</i>

145
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:41,172
<i>But this time...</i>

146
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:43,208
<i>...someone wearing</i>
<i>a dark spandex suit</i>

147
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,110
<i>swung in on a rope</i>
<i>from the top of the tent pole</i>

148
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:47,129
<i>and cut the tightrope.</i>

149
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,147
<i>They tumbled down, bounced up</i>
<i>high off the safety net</i>

150
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,217
<i>and ripped a hole through</i>
<i>the roof of the tent.</i>

151
00:10:54,221 --> 00:10:56,388
<i>Fortunately, they landed</i>
<i>safely in the street,</i>

152
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,957
<i>and actually</i>
<i>would have been fine,</i>

153
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,127
<i>except as they were brushing</i>
<i>themselves off,</i>

154
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:04,262
<i>a short yellow bus</i>
<i>accidentally backed over them.</i>

155
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:11,336
Oh! Aw, crap!

156
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,738
Oh!

157
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,407
Ugh!

158
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:20,445
They never found the man
in the dark spandex suit.

159
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:23,181
But from that day forward,

160
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,250
I made a vow

161
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:26,918
that I would be
like the Dark Winged Vesper

162
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,055
and avenge
my mom and dad's death.

163
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:34,159
You are a fan
of the Dark Winged Vesper?

164
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:36,127
Oh, yes!

165
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:37,996
And today on my way home,

166
00:11:37,998 --> 00:11:40,732
I saw a man aiming a gun
at an innocent woman,

167
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:42,400
and I said to myself,

168
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:45,003
"What would
the Dark Winged Vesper do?"

169
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:47,338
So I hit that man in the face
with a two-by-four.

170
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:52,310
Mr. Gruber-Man,

171
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:56,181
if you were not a superhero,
I would throw the book at you.

172
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:58,283
But...

173
00:11:58,285 --> 00:12:01,119
you are a superhero,
aren't you?

174
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:05,390
Me? Uh, uh, yes. Yes, I am.

175
00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:09,994
And what are your powers?

176
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:12,464
Well, you know, my powers
are in development,

177
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:14,466
and, um,

178
00:12:14,468 --> 00:12:15,834
you know...

179
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:18,870
Mm-hmm. Well, Gruber-Man,

180
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:21,773
in view of the tragic story
of your childhood

181
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:24,409
and your devotion
to the Dark Winged Vesper,

182
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:27,512
I'm going to
have to sentence you

183
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:31,783
to pay damages to the plaintiff

184
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:36,087
for the sum of one dollar.

185
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,924
Objection!

186
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,359
Hey, watch out, man.
You hit my hand.

187
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:43,528
Objection, Your Honor.
That's... That's absurd.

188
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,230
Okay, listen, listen.

189
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:47,332
I've had enough out of you.

190
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:49,200
Now sit down.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

191
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:51,236
What if I were to tell you

192
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:53,171
I could probably find
this Red character,

193
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:55,073
and her testimony
would send both you

194
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:57,308
and your idiot client
up the river

195
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,310
for a very long time?

196
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:00,812
That would be bad for me.

197
00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:02,914
But for him, I don't care.
Send him up the river.

198
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,349
But, Your Honor,
in all honesty,

199
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:06,417
may I have the payment,
if you wouldn't mind,

200
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:07,886
in cash?

201
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:09,888
Pay the man.

202
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,456
Oh, uh...

203
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,698
I...

204
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:19,831
Thank you.

205
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:22,967
And here's your cut.

206
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,036
Just ain't no justice,
is there?

207
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,440
Ta-ta.

208
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:34,379
So, um, I guess I'll be going.

209
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:38,049
You may be a disgrace
as a superhero,

210
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:40,819
but you're a superhero
nonetheless.

211
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:43,454
And this city needs all
the superheroes it can get.

212
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:46,324
So therefore, I'm going
to sentence you

213
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:49,828
to a halfway house
for superheroes in training.

214
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,896
You will be
a Super Caper member.

215
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:54,132
There you will be forced
to develop your powers

216
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:56,301
and be held accountable
for your actions.

217
00:13:56,303 --> 00:13:58,469
Should you violate
this court order,

218
00:13:58,471 --> 00:13:59,971
I will send you to jail

219
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:01,840
for the rest of your
natural-born life.

220
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:04,509
If you agree to these
terms, sign here.

221
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,125
Aah.

222
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,097
Bailiff!

223
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:28,199
Not again!

224
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,635
I don't want any more capes
in my courtroom.

225
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:33,204
You understand me?

226
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:36,040
Court's adjourned.

227
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,378
<i>So this is it...</i>

228
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,882
<i>the start of my new life</i>
<i>as a superhero.</i>

229
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,067
Think they'd give you
a newer cab,

230
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:06,137
at least one with a roof, huh?

231
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:08,139
Then we wouldn't have
air conditioning,

232
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:09,421
now would we?

233
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:14,245
That big house
is where I'm headed.

234
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,547
I'm, uh... I'm gonna
be a superhero.

235
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:19,017
Oh, big deal.

236
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:22,186
I used to be
a superhero myself.

237
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:25,957
A superhero? Really? Who?

238
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:30,061
I was Manbat.

239
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:32,430
Would you like an autograph?

240
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,599
Oh, heck, yeah. Sure.

241
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:39,537
No charge.

242
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,341
Oh, thanks.

243
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:05,663
Good luck.

244
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:12,236
<i>Wow, Manbat.</i>

245
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:24,515
<i>My breath was taken away</i>

246
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:27,285
<i>when I saw the outside</i>
<i>of my superhero hideaway.</i>

247
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:28,419
<i>Oh!</i>

248
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:30,388
<i>I could get used to this.</i>

249
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:33,524
<i>¶ Raindrops keep falling</i>
<i>on my head ¶</i>

250
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:36,494
<i>¶ Just like the guy</i>
<i>whose feet ¶</i>

251
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,764
<i>¶ Are too big for his bed ¶</i>

252
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:42,333
<i>¶ Nothing seems to fit ¶</i>

253
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:46,337
<i>¶ Those raindrops</i>
<i>are falling on my head ¶</i>

254
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,573
<i>¶ They keep falling ¶</i>

255
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:51,309
<i>¶ So I just did me ¶</i>

256
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:54,112
<i>¶ Some talking to the sun ¶</i>

257
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:05,523
Ed Gruberman,
new superhero for hire.

258
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:09,027
I may not look like much,
but I am sharp as a whip.

259
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:10,661
Where's your luggage?

260
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,698
Aw, crap!

261
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:17,335
Here.

262
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:22,754
Don't want you
getting my floor wet.

263
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:26,310
Thanks.

264
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:27,445
Oh, wow.

265
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:34,786
So, uh, you're...
Boogerman, is it?

266
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:37,188
No. Gruberman. Yeah.

267
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,523
That's good.

268
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:39,824
I didn't want to think

269
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:42,266
what kind of superpowers
Boogerman would have.

270
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:53,738
So you're Sarge, my mentor.

271
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:57,708
Me Gruberman, you Sarge.

272
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:02,413
You know, I can't help
but imagine all the superheroes

273
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,382
who have walked
down this hall, huh?

274
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:07,118
I mean, years and years
of training new recruits,

275
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,620
only to see them go out
and save the world.

276
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:12,824
I've only been here six months.

277
00:18:12,826 --> 00:18:14,592
Oh.

278
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,700
Are you coming or not?

279
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:24,701
Yes, right.
Show me the villains.

280
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:27,705
I am ready to kick some butt.

281
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:29,874
This ain't no superhero
movie, Gruberman.

282
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:31,676
You get out there in the field

283
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:33,477
and you screw up
with the real bad guys,

284
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,579
you can't holler "cut"

285
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:36,214
and shoot the scene over again.

286
00:18:36,216 --> 00:18:37,348
Now come on.

287
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,551
Let's go meet
the rest of your team.

288
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:43,705
<i>Sarge is right.</i>

289
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,590
<i>If this was a superhero movie,</i>

290
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:47,859
<i>my character would have</i>
<i>run off to the Grubercave</i>

291
00:18:47,861 --> 00:18:50,294
<i>with Red by my side.</i>

292
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:05,643
<i>¶¶</i>

293
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:21,592
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

294
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:22,793
Hey, space cadet.

295
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:24,662
Can we get on with this?

296
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,797
Oh, yeah.

297
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,599
This is the lounge
where most of the Super Capers

298
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:30,568
hang out at.

299
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:32,609
You can learn something
from those slackers.

300
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:37,775
Attention, everyone.

301
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:39,810
I want y'all to meet
our newest member,

302
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:41,179
Ed Gruberman.

303
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:44,649
I trust y'all will
make him feel welcome.

304
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:49,587
Welcome to Super Capers.

305
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:58,796
Excuse me, miss.

306
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:01,399
Can I have a glass
of ice water?

307
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:04,502
I suppose you think

308
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:07,271
because I'm a woman
behind a counter

309
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:09,473
that I'm supposed
to wait on you?

310
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:11,876
Well, maybe you've
heard this old joke,

311
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:14,245
but how many men does
it take to open a beer?

312
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:15,413
Hmm? None.

313
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:17,748
It should be open
when she brings it.

314
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:21,419
Very well, then, Your Highness.

315
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:33,798
Oh, it's cold.

316
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:38,302
That's Felicia Freeze.

317
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:40,705
Next time, I'll ask
for it without ice.

318
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:46,844
Your head is so big.

319
00:20:48,014 --> 00:20:49,513
You know, Mother always said,

320
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:50,915
"If you can't say
something nice,

321
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:53,584
don't say anything at all."

322
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:54,719
I'm sorry.

323
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:56,721
It's just... your head...

324
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:59,790
I know, I know!
It's big, it's big.

325
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:01,492
It's a great big head.

326
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:02,927
Thanks for noticing.

327
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:05,496
Maybe that's why
they call me Brainard.

328
00:21:05,498 --> 00:21:07,632
First name Herman.

329
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:11,502
You know, there are benefits

330
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:13,571
to an oversized head.

331
00:21:36,362 --> 00:21:37,895
What are your superpowers?

332
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,766
Oh, well...

333
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:44,935
Hello. My name is Q.

334
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:46,837
Hi. You must be Ed.

335
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:49,874
Your name is Herbert.
This isn't 007.

336
00:21:51,377 --> 00:21:53,911
You can call me Q.

337
00:21:53,913 --> 00:21:55,913
So, Ed, is it?

338
00:21:55,915 --> 00:21:59,450
This is my sidekick, Robo, Ed.

339
00:21:59,452 --> 00:22:01,786
What kind of superhero is this?

340
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:04,422
Look at your puny arms.

341
00:22:04,424 --> 00:22:08,025
What a girly-man you are, Ed.

342
00:22:08,027 --> 00:22:09,593
He sounds just like...

343
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:11,429
No. No, he doesn't.

344
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:14,432
I'll be back.

345
00:22:14,434 --> 00:22:16,967
Anyhoo, I'm the gadget man.

346
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:19,637
I'll be responsible
for anything you might need.

347
00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:21,605
I shall also be
designing your outfit.

348
00:22:21,607 --> 00:22:22,940
Oh, great! Can I help you?

349
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:25,643
No. That will not be necessary.

350
00:22:25,645 --> 00:22:27,712
Plenty of sources
of inspiration out there.

351
00:22:27,714 --> 00:22:28,994
Come on, Robo.

352
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:34,985
<i>Hasta la vista,</i> girly-man.

353
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:36,921
Oh!

354
00:22:36,923 --> 00:22:38,122
Ow.

355
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,859
Hey, my commercial's on.

356
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:43,928
<i>Will Powers, superhero here.</i>

357
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,930
<i>When I'm out there</i>
<i>fighting evildoers,</i>

358
00:22:45,932 --> 00:22:46,964
<i>sometimes it helps</i>
<i>to have a car</i>

359
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:47,965
<i>to throw at them.</i>

360
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:50,368
<i>Do I want just any car? No.</i>

361
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:53,003
<i>I need a car that is gonna</i>
<i>crush their spineless bodies</i>

362
00:22:53,005 --> 00:22:54,705
<i>and survive the impact.</i>

363
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:56,006
<i>So I turn to Jeffrow Motors.</i>

364
00:22:56,008 --> 00:22:58,042
<i>Hey, have a hot wife?</i>

365
00:22:58,044 --> 00:22:59,810
<i>Bring her in, get a new car.</i>

366
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:02,813
<i>It'll be a great trade.</i>

367
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:07,918
<i>Best bang for your buck.</i>

368
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,954
<i>Hubcaps are extra.</i>

369
00:23:15,862 --> 00:23:18,662
<i>So remember, if you're gonna</i>
<i>trade in that old car,</i>

370
00:23:18,664 --> 00:23:19,964
<i>think Jeffrow Motors.</i>

371
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:21,031
<i>If you're trading</i>
<i>that hottie wife,</i>

372
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:22,967
<i>think Will Powers.</i>

373
00:23:22,969 --> 00:23:25,436
<i>Just joking.</i>
<i>Not really, though.</i>

374
00:23:25,438 --> 00:23:28,038
<i>Will Powers... superhero</i>
<i>making super deals</i>

375
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,941
<i>for super people like you.</i>

376
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:34,011
Wasn't that great?

377
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:35,813
How about it, Puffer Boy?

378
00:23:35,815 --> 00:23:38,682
Uh, special effects
were awesome.

379
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:40,184
What special effects?

380
00:23:40,186 --> 00:23:41,886
I wanted to get a Ferrari,

381
00:23:41,888 --> 00:23:43,754
but Mother made me
get a Hyundai.

382
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:46,524
It was disgusting.

383
00:23:46,526 --> 00:23:48,959
Reawr.

384
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,630
What about you, Ed?
What did you think?

385
00:23:52,632 --> 00:23:54,799
Oh, I loved it.

386
00:23:55,735 --> 00:23:57,668
Um, Mr. Powers,

387
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:58,803
do you think
it would be possible

388
00:23:58,805 --> 00:24:00,966
for me to get an autograph?

389
00:24:01,841 --> 00:24:04,008
I don't get paid
enough for this.

390
00:24:05,745 --> 00:24:08,579
Yeah, no. We... We
can do that later.

391
00:24:11,017 --> 00:24:14,051
So, why do they
call you Puffer Boy?

392
00:24:15,688 --> 00:24:18,556
When I get scared,
I blow up like a pufferfish.

393
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:19,990
Really?

394
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:20,925
Yeah.

395
00:24:20,927 --> 00:24:22,593
That's interesting.

396
00:24:22,595 --> 00:24:25,796
You know, I saw this whole
documentary about pufferfish...

397
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,800
Oh, wow.

398
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:32,069
You weren't joking. Nice.

399
00:24:32,071 --> 00:24:34,205
So how do you change back?

400
00:24:34,207 --> 00:24:35,840
Well, that's the fun part.

401
00:24:35,842 --> 00:24:37,508
Pull my spike.

402
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:48,185
Quite the ladies' man,
aren't you?

403
00:24:56,496 --> 00:25:00,097
Will! Will! I did it.

404
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:02,166
I was able to develop my power.

405
00:25:04,537 --> 00:25:06,170
Look.

406
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:08,606
See? I can create fire.

407
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:11,775
That's amazing!

408
00:25:11,777 --> 00:25:14,945
We shall call you...

409
00:25:14,947 --> 00:25:17,781
Igniter Boy.

410
00:25:17,783 --> 00:25:20,050
Well, I don't know
about amazing.

411
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:22,820
It was like a match
or candlelight or...

412
00:25:22,822 --> 00:25:24,588
Can you make it go higher?

413
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,156
Ooh, and brighter.

414
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:28,592
I don't know. Let me try.

415
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,566
Careful, Igniter Boy.

416
00:25:39,805 --> 00:25:43,140
Okay, that was amazing.

417
00:25:43,142 --> 00:25:44,808
Can he do it again?

418
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,310
He's gone.

419
00:25:46,312 --> 00:25:49,079
Okay, if any other superheroes
have a one-time power,

420
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:51,015
please hold off
on showing it to us.

421
00:25:51,017 --> 00:25:53,851
Hey, listen up, gang.
We got a Code 6.

422
00:25:53,853 --> 00:25:55,853
Cretan's back.

423
00:25:55,855 --> 00:25:57,588
He took control
of two armored trucks

424
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,056
and he's camped
at the Main Street Bridge.

425
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:00,591
Come on, Puffer, let's go.

426
00:26:00,593 --> 00:26:02,726
Will, you take newbie with you,

427
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:04,194
and show him some excitement.

428
00:26:04,196 --> 00:26:05,880
I don't know, Sarge.

429
00:26:05,881 --> 00:26:07,565
It takes quite a bit
to excite this guy.

430
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:10,568
Just ask Igniter Boy.

431
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:13,003
What the hell
is he talking about?

432
00:26:13,005 --> 00:26:15,139
Gotta go! Code 6!

433
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:18,642
What the hell
is he talking about?

434
00:26:20,046 --> 00:26:22,079
Yes, Mother, I'm wearing
clean underwear.

435
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:25,149
So I bet Herbert built you
guys, like, a super jet

436
00:26:25,151 --> 00:26:28,018
or a missile-firing
supermobile, right?

437
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,353
Herbert's a great inventor,

438
00:26:29,355 --> 00:26:31,922
but you know he's a big
movie buff, don't you?

439
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:33,123
So?

440
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:34,758
Let's just say
he doesn't get points

441
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,127
for originality
in his inventions.

442
00:26:39,732 --> 00:26:42,266
Oh, you gotta be kidding me!

443
00:26:50,242 --> 00:26:52,142
Wow!

444
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:54,043
The inside looks like
one of those space movies.

445
00:26:54,046 --> 00:26:56,146
Yeah, this baby is decked out.

446
00:26:56,148 --> 00:26:58,315
Q even put a tracking device
on the key chain

447
00:26:58,317 --> 00:27:00,184
because I kept losing
the RV at the mall.

448
00:27:00,186 --> 00:27:02,753
Hey, what's that
blue flashing light do?

449
00:27:02,755 --> 00:27:05,055
That's what makes
time travel possible.

450
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:06,357
Really?

451
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:08,125
I don't know. Maybe.

452
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:09,193
What do you mean?

453
00:27:09,195 --> 00:27:11,295
Nobody knows if it works.

454
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:14,365
A decked-out RV won't
get up to 88 miles an hour.

455
00:27:14,367 --> 00:27:15,399
Then what's it for?

456
00:27:15,401 --> 00:27:18,235
To get us from
point A to point B.

457
00:27:18,237 --> 00:27:20,838
But it looks cool, huh?

458
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,807
Hey, Ed, since this
is your first gig,

459
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:25,409
you want to drive? Yeah!

460
00:27:25,411 --> 00:27:27,011
I bet you would.

461
00:27:27,013 --> 00:27:28,712
Too bad you'd only wreck it.

462
00:27:28,714 --> 00:27:29,880
Tell you what
I'm gonna do, though.

463
00:27:29,882 --> 00:27:32,750
I'm gonna punch in
the date and time

464
00:27:32,752 --> 00:27:34,284
as your first mission.

465
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:37,254
At least this contraption
will be good for something.

466
00:27:37,256 --> 00:27:40,090
Okay, Super Capers...

467
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:42,126
Let's move! Let's fly!

468
00:27:42,128 --> 00:27:43,827
We said...

469
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:46,130
Super Capers, let's roll.
Come on.

470
00:27:46,132 --> 00:27:47,898
Go. No, go. I thought you...

471
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,166
How about rock?

472
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:51,168
That's not bad. I like that.

473
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,270
Super Capers... Let's rock!

474
00:27:53,272 --> 00:27:54,338
Whoo!

475
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:08,686
Move 'em out!

476
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:48,292
<i>Sure, I'm just a human</i>
<i>and have no real abilities</i>

477
00:28:48,294 --> 00:28:50,227
<i>like my superhero friends...</i>

478
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:52,362
<i>so I duck down</i>
<i>behind a squad car.</i>

479
00:28:52,364 --> 00:28:55,365
<i>No sense in getting</i>
<i>in their way.</i>

480
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:57,234
What are you doing?

481
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:59,870
Oh, uh, I'm, uh...

482
00:28:59,872 --> 00:29:03,373
Just checking these cars
for gas leaks.

483
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:05,242
Oh, is that one
of your special powers?

484
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:07,778
Could be.

485
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,213
Jealous?

486
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:15,786
Will Powers?

487
00:29:15,788 --> 00:29:17,054
They came out of nowhere.

488
00:29:17,056 --> 00:29:18,322
Overturned one
of the armored trucks

489
00:29:18,324 --> 00:29:20,124
and started ransacking the gold.
They?

490
00:29:20,126 --> 00:29:22,993
His buddy's inside
the other armored truck.

491
00:29:22,995 --> 00:29:25,162
Okay, Officer,
I'll take it from here.

492
00:29:25,164 --> 00:29:27,364
I just want you to know
I'm a big fan.

493
00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:28,832
Is there any chance
I can get your autograph?

494
00:29:28,834 --> 00:29:31,902
Sure! Anything
for one of L.A.'s finest.

495
00:29:33,906 --> 00:29:35,005
Okay.

496
00:29:35,007 --> 00:29:37,141
Oh, well, how about
a picture, huh?

497
00:29:37,143 --> 00:29:38,208
Yeah.

498
00:29:39,478 --> 00:29:43,113
Will! The Cretan. Remember?

499
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:45,949
Right on it, doll face.

500
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:47,518
A little music
should set the mood.

501
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,320
<i>¶ We need Will Powers ¶</i>
Excuse me, guys.

502
00:29:50,322 --> 00:29:52,356
<i>¶ He's got the looks</i>
<i>and the charm ¶</i>

503
00:29:52,358 --> 00:29:54,258
<i>¶ And he's fit for the fight ¶</i>

504
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,927
<i>¶ He's got real powers ¶</i>

505
00:29:56,929 --> 00:30:00,030
The jig is up,
my mischievous foes.

506
00:30:05,204 --> 00:30:06,503
Who is that I hear?

507
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:08,071
Will Powers?

508
00:30:08,073 --> 00:30:10,174
They couldn't send
a real superhero,

509
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,975
so they had to send you.

510
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:14,344
If it isn't Captain Sludge.

511
00:30:14,346 --> 00:30:16,947
Or should I say
"Captain Fudge"?

512
00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:21,919
What? That's funny.

513
00:30:21,921 --> 00:30:23,086
Never mind.

514
00:30:23,088 --> 00:30:25,422
Your diabolical plan ends here.

515
00:30:25,424 --> 00:30:27,457
Gaah!

516
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:30,127
And who is gonna stop us? You?

517
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:32,296
<i>Wow. Watching Will in action</i>

518
00:30:32,298 --> 00:30:35,098
<i>makes me appreciate why</i>
<i>I wanna be a Super Caper.</i>

519
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,867
<i>This isn't as bad as I thought.</i>

520
00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:39,336
<i>He is gonna save the day.
We are heroes.</i>

521
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:42,606
I've noticed you've gained
a little weight there.

522
00:30:42,608 --> 00:30:45,309
And are those gray hairs I see

523
00:30:45,311 --> 00:30:48,412
coming through
those highlights?

524
00:30:52,284 --> 00:30:54,384
Will, what's wrong?
Are you... Aah!

525
00:30:54,386 --> 00:30:56,353
What just happened?

526
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:59,456
Sludge knows Will's weakness.

527
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:00,908
What about you?

528
00:31:00,909 --> 00:31:02,359
When are you gonna
use your powers?

529
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:04,494
I-I'm working on it.
I just need more time.

530
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:07,231
Well, while you wait
for puberty to kick in,

531
00:31:07,233 --> 00:31:08,498
we're moving on.

532
00:31:12,438 --> 00:31:15,405
Puffer Boy, what's the plan?

533
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:16,573
Me?

534
00:31:16,575 --> 00:31:19,176
Oh, boy.

535
00:31:19,178 --> 00:31:20,344
There, there.

536
00:31:20,346 --> 00:31:22,179
It's okay.

537
00:31:23,415 --> 00:31:25,382
Don't look at me.

538
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,350
Mother's phone call
triggered a migraine.

539
00:31:27,353 --> 00:31:29,319
Do you know how painful
a migraine is

540
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:31,421
with a head this size?

541
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,160
Will! Will, you gotta
snap out of it.

542
00:31:37,162 --> 00:31:39,329
Look away. I'm hideous.

543
00:31:39,331 --> 00:31:41,431
Will, you're fit,
you're strong,

544
00:31:41,433 --> 00:31:43,133
you're charismatic,

545
00:31:43,135 --> 00:31:45,402
and you're really good-looking.

546
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:47,037
Really?

547
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,906
Wait a minute.

548
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:50,374
Are you gay?

549
00:31:50,376 --> 00:31:51,508
No.

550
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,176
I'm totally straight.

551
00:31:53,178 --> 00:31:55,679
Which proves how really
good-looking you are.

552
00:31:55,681 --> 00:31:57,547
Sorry, Ed.

553
00:31:57,549 --> 00:31:59,283
It'll take months for me
to get my groove back.

554
00:31:59,285 --> 00:32:00,565
It's up to you, buddy.

555
00:32:05,457 --> 00:32:06,523
What are you doing?

556
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:08,625
I'm praying for help.

557
00:32:08,627 --> 00:32:10,427
Are you serious?

558
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:11,428
This whole time you've been

559
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,230
keeping this a secret from us?

560
00:32:13,232 --> 00:32:14,531
I'm sorry?

561
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:15,499
Whoa! Hey, guys!

562
00:32:15,501 --> 00:32:18,201
Hold up. Check this out.

563
00:32:18,203 --> 00:32:20,671
Attention, Captain Sludge.

564
00:32:20,673 --> 00:32:22,606
I have a news flash for you.

565
00:32:24,076 --> 00:32:27,477
Oh, pansy boy is back.
This ought to be good.

566
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:30,981
You better pray for forgiveness

567
00:32:30,983 --> 00:32:32,049
while you still can.

568
00:32:32,051 --> 00:32:33,450
What?

569
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:35,619
And why, pray tell?

570
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:38,422
Exactly.

571
00:32:38,424 --> 00:32:40,657
This is Ed Gruberman,

572
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:43,460
one of the greatest
superheroes of all time.

573
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,279
Well, um...

574
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,097
He has the right hand
of God on his side.

575
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:48,565
Oh, really?

576
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:50,000
Well...

577
00:32:52,171 --> 00:32:53,470
Go, Cretan.

578
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:55,973
It's you against God, baby!

579
00:33:05,584 --> 00:33:07,084
Uh, Will, I think
you might have

580
00:33:07,086 --> 00:33:08,366
misunderstood me.

581
00:33:10,589 --> 00:33:12,489
If you're gonna
use your powers,

582
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:13,557
you'd better do it now, Ed.

583
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:15,525
But, Will... Now!

584
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:21,721
<i>I was cornered.</i>

585
00:33:21,722 --> 00:33:23,111
<i>What would</i>
<i>the Dark Winged Vesper do?</i>

586
00:33:23,112 --> 00:33:24,501
<i>I... I had no idea,</i>
<i>so I just shouted</i>

587
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:26,503
<i>the first thing</i>
<i>that came into my head.</i>

588
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:28,538
Dear God, flatten thy enemy.

589
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,107
Smite him with your smiter.

590
00:33:31,777 --> 00:33:33,577
Oh, God!

591
00:33:33,579 --> 00:33:36,046
I'm walking through the shadow
of Death Valley with you

592
00:33:36,048 --> 00:33:37,581
and I pledge allegiance to you,

593
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:38,782
so beat this evil brute

594
00:33:38,784 --> 00:33:40,217
for the republic
for which you stand.

595
00:33:40,219 --> 00:33:41,739
So help me, I do! Shalom!

596
00:33:49,128 --> 00:33:50,527
You did it, buddy.

597
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:53,163
I did.

598
00:33:53,165 --> 00:33:55,298
I... I mean, I did!

599
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,466
<i>But how?</i>

600
00:33:56,468 --> 00:33:58,335
Oh, great!

601
00:33:58,337 --> 00:34:00,370
He really does have
the power of God.

602
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:09,112
Cretan! Up!

603
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:14,251
Horns down.

604
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:27,364
Let this be a warning.

605
00:34:27,366 --> 00:34:29,366
You don't mess with
the powers of Ed Gruberman.

606
00:34:29,368 --> 00:34:30,700
Yeah! I'll, uh...

607
00:34:30,702 --> 00:34:32,803
I'll ask the Lord
to lay the smackdown.

608
00:34:32,805 --> 00:34:35,338
Yeah, high-five! Whoohoo! Ow!

609
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,573
This isn't over!

610
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:39,776
We will be back, Mr. Gruberman!

611
00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:45,615
Nice work, Gruberman.

612
00:34:45,617 --> 00:34:48,552
Just remember,
I'll always be number one.

613
00:34:48,554 --> 00:34:50,454
Super Capers!

614
00:34:52,391 --> 00:34:53,457
Should we go after them?

615
00:34:53,459 --> 00:34:55,625
Oh, no, no.
It's only the first act.

616
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:57,194
We gotta keep
the viewer interested.

617
00:34:57,196 --> 00:34:58,562
Let 'em live
to fight another day.

618
00:34:58,564 --> 00:35:00,864
Hey, uh, you want
my autograph, don't ya?

619
00:35:00,866 --> 00:35:02,599
Huh. Who do you think you are?

620
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:03,700
Will Powers?

621
00:35:06,738 --> 00:35:11,174
I, uh... I guess
I underestimated you.

622
00:35:11,176 --> 00:35:13,610
The power of prayer.

623
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:15,745
Huh. Hmm.

624
00:35:18,851 --> 00:35:20,717
Well done, everyone.

625
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:22,719
Well done, Gruberman!
Your Honor.

626
00:35:22,721 --> 00:35:25,122
You were here? Of course.

627
00:35:25,124 --> 00:35:26,123
I always like keeping track

628
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:28,625
of the beneficiaries
of my mercy.

629
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:32,362
The Dark Winged Vesper
would be very proud of you!

630
00:35:35,501 --> 00:35:36,633
Keep up the good work.

631
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:38,802
We're late. Let's boogie!

632
00:35:41,206 --> 00:35:42,706
<i>Ciao.</i>

633
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:45,142
Driver, drive, drive!

634
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:46,610
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

635
00:35:46,612 --> 00:35:48,578
<i>The light post</i>
<i>accidentally gave way</i>

636
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,313
<i>at just the right moment</i>
<i>we needed it to,</i>

637
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:52,682
<i>and I look like</i>
<i>a great superhero.</i>

638
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:54,784
<i>Maybe you are</i>
<i>looking out for me.</i>

639
00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:56,286
<i>Thanks.</i>

640
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,654
Hey, Ed!

641
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:59,623
Sarge is on the phone!

642
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:02,159
He wants to personally
thank you

643
00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:04,861
for letting the bad guys go!

644
00:36:04,863 --> 00:36:06,796
He's also yelling
something about

645
00:36:06,798 --> 00:36:09,900
physically removing your legs
to kick your butt with!

646
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,604
<i>Dear Lord, if you do</i>
<i>give me special powers,</i>

647
00:36:14,606 --> 00:36:17,274
<i>incredible speed would be</i>
<i>really useful about now.</i>

648
00:36:25,584 --> 00:36:26,850
Help me! Help me!

649
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:28,718
Is there not a heroic gentleman

650
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,820
who's willing to save
a poor girl in danger?

651
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:33,690
Shut up, you dame, before
I pump you full of lead.

652
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,494
Excuse me, ma'am.
Is this thug bothering you?

653
00:36:37,496 --> 00:36:39,329
It's the Dark Winged Vesper,

654
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:40,730
my hero.

655
00:36:40,732 --> 00:36:42,799
The Dark Winged Vesper?

656
00:36:42,801 --> 00:36:44,801
Oh, no!

657
00:36:44,803 --> 00:36:47,304
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

658
00:36:47,306 --> 00:36:49,506
Bang! Aah!

659
00:36:51,343 --> 00:36:52,642
Aah!

660
00:36:58,684 --> 00:37:01,718
Dark Vesper,
how will I repay you?

661
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,386
Now, now, miss.

662
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:04,554
Although we may starve,

663
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,823
a superhero fights for justice.

664
00:37:06,825 --> 00:37:08,358
We do not need rewards

665
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:09,892
for performing
acts of kindness.

666
00:37:09,895 --> 00:37:11,328
Hmm.

667
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:12,762
No need to starve.

668
00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:15,298
Let me make you dinner
tonight at my place.

669
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,734
Goulash. Um.

670
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,336
20 bucks will do.

671
00:37:19,338 --> 00:37:21,705
<i>Ah, the Dark Winged Vesper.</i>

672
00:37:21,707 --> 00:37:24,474
<i>Here was a hero that had class.</i>

673
00:37:24,476 --> 00:37:26,743
<i>Like my idol, I think</i>
<i>I'm really starting</i>

674
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:28,812
<i>to prove myself</i>
<i>as a worthy superhero.</i>

675
00:37:28,814 --> 00:37:31,514
<i>Last week on the bridge,</i>
<i>I showed great potential.</i>

676
00:37:31,516 --> 00:37:34,784
<i>I'm no longer that kid that
would sit around in his tights.</i>

677
00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:36,786
<i>I've moved up to boxers.</i>

678
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:40,824
Hey.

679
00:37:40,826 --> 00:37:43,260
I really appreciate
your keeping me company

680
00:37:43,262 --> 00:37:44,828
while I help Mother do laundry.

681
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,029
Ah, don't mention it.

682
00:37:46,031 --> 00:37:47,664
I've been wearing
this suit for a week,

683
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:50,567
and I think it's beginning
to develop a super stench.

684
00:37:50,569 --> 00:37:52,869
Gertrude! Gertrude, look.

685
00:37:52,871 --> 00:37:55,505
Oh, there he is.
Oh, Gertrude, look.

686
00:37:55,507 --> 00:37:59,743
This is the superhero
I was telling you about.

687
00:37:59,745 --> 00:38:01,811
He talks to God

688
00:38:01,813 --> 00:38:04,648
and God answers his prayers.

689
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:06,549
Well, I wouldn't put it
exactly like that.

690
00:38:06,551 --> 00:38:09,619
Well, really, if he
really is in touch with God

691
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:12,055
and he's some sort
of superhero prophet,

692
00:38:12,057 --> 00:38:14,324
why is he half naked?

693
00:38:18,363 --> 00:38:19,596
Jesus loves me.

694
00:38:19,598 --> 00:38:20,797
That's got to count
for something, right?

695
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:23,500
Oh, Eddie, you are
far too modest.

696
00:38:23,502 --> 00:38:25,435
You saved everybody

697
00:38:25,437 --> 00:38:27,671
on that bridge and you know it.

698
00:38:27,673 --> 00:38:29,673
I was there, too, Mother.

699
00:38:29,675 --> 00:38:31,941
Herman, it is impolite
to interrupt.

700
00:38:31,943 --> 00:38:34,611
Why must everything
always revolve around you?

701
00:38:34,613 --> 00:38:35,679
But, Mother...

702
00:38:35,681 --> 00:38:37,047
Oh, please,
stop this jibber jabbering

703
00:38:37,049 --> 00:38:40,717
and go get my panties
out of the dryer.

704
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:42,385
Yes, Mother.

705
00:38:42,387 --> 00:38:43,953
Eddie, I was wondering,

706
00:38:43,955 --> 00:38:45,955
since you talk to God,

707
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:48,658
whether you could ask him
if I'm going to heaven.

708
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,793
Oh.

709
00:38:49,795 --> 00:38:51,094
Oh, oh! Me, too. Me, too.

710
00:38:51,096 --> 00:38:52,829
And what about my cat?

711
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,931
I cannot go to heaven
without my cat.

712
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:58,702
Now, and my arthritis
is bothering me.

713
00:38:58,704 --> 00:39:00,537
Could you heal me?

714
00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:01,638
Oh... Wait a minute. Wait.

715
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,807
If he's going to heal you...

716
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:05,975
I want you to look at my
canker sore, right there.

717
00:39:05,977 --> 00:39:07,544
Could you take a look at it?

718
00:39:07,546 --> 00:39:10,113
There. It's just right...
You can touch it.

719
00:39:10,115 --> 00:39:11,448
Oh, thanks.

720
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:13,116
But it's the size
of a dung beetle.

721
00:39:13,118 --> 00:39:14,517
It is enormous.

722
00:39:16,121 --> 00:39:17,571
It's my turn!

723
00:39:17,572 --> 00:39:19,022
Is that a Bingo Hall
I see across the street?

724
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:20,123
Bingo? Oh!

725
00:39:20,125 --> 00:39:21,958
Bingo? Let's go!
I'm going to win!

726
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,440
Not this time, you old bat.

727
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:39,876
Hey, where'd they go?

728
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:42,612
I... Yeah. Hmm.

729
00:39:43,949 --> 00:39:47,417
Mother, I told you
not to wander.

730
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:02,866
Hey, that's the judge.

731
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:07,804
What do you suppose
he was putting in the trunk?

732
00:40:07,806 --> 00:40:10,006
Let's go.

733
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:11,474
I don't know.

734
00:40:11,476 --> 00:40:14,411
Hey, why don't
we call him and ask him?

735
00:40:14,413 --> 00:40:16,679
Uh, we can't do that.

736
00:40:16,681 --> 00:40:17,914
<i>Deposit 25 cents, please.</i>

737
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:20,817
Yeah, I used all my quarters
at the Laundromat.

738
00:40:20,819 --> 00:40:23,920
Ooh! Let's follow him.

739
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:26,489
Uh, we can't do that, either.

740
00:40:26,491 --> 00:40:27,757
All right.

741
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:29,159
We'll go play Bingo
with your mother

742
00:40:29,161 --> 00:40:31,728
and she can tell me
why a grown man in his 50s

743
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:33,863
still sleeps in the same bed
as his mother.

744
00:40:33,865 --> 00:40:36,516
Hey.

745
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:39,168
You know, Herbert Q.
Did design a radar system

746
00:40:39,171 --> 00:40:44,574
so we could follow
without being noticed.

747
00:40:44,576 --> 00:40:46,042
And for the record,

748
00:40:46,044 --> 00:40:48,144
Mother and I
have separate beds.

749
00:40:48,146 --> 00:40:50,847
Yeah. Sounds like
years of therapy.

750
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:53,983
And they're at least
3 feet apart!

751
00:41:10,202 --> 00:41:12,101
You know, Your Honor,
there's this really ugly RV

752
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:15,104
that's been following us
for a while.

753
00:41:15,106 --> 00:41:16,639
Yes, yes, I know.

754
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:19,742
Let's just remain
inconspicuous.

755
00:41:19,744 --> 00:41:22,946
Those dysfunctional heroes
are falling right into my trap.

756
00:41:32,791 --> 00:41:34,691
Herman, don't you think
we're following

757
00:41:34,693 --> 00:41:35,758
a little too close?

758
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,993
I mean, we got 'em on radar.

759
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:40,230
Yeah, but it only has
a 20-foot range.

760
00:41:40,232 --> 00:41:41,798
20 feet?

761
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,166
Then what good is it?

762
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:46,169
It might get foggy.

763
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:48,805
Okay.

764
00:41:48,807 --> 00:41:51,107
Hey, uh...

765
00:41:51,109 --> 00:41:53,543
Hey, Brainard.

766
00:41:53,545 --> 00:41:56,112
You know Felicia and...

767
00:41:56,114 --> 00:41:58,147
Do you think a girl like her

768
00:41:58,149 --> 00:42:00,083
and a guy like me

769
00:42:00,085 --> 00:42:01,618
could ever...

770
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:03,520
Oh. Oh, yeah. Sure.

771
00:42:03,522 --> 00:42:06,089
If God floods the entire world

772
00:42:06,091 --> 00:42:08,958
and you two
are the sole survivors.

773
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,094
So you're saying
we got a chance, huh?

774
00:42:11,096 --> 00:42:13,079
Great!

775
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,120
You know, you could
be thinking of a plan.

776
00:42:22,107 --> 00:42:23,673
All right, look.

777
00:42:23,675 --> 00:42:25,174
We're never gonna catch up
to him in this thing.

778
00:42:25,176 --> 00:42:27,677
Hey, why don't you use
your mind thing

779
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:29,012
and pop open the trunk.

780
00:42:29,014 --> 00:42:31,915
No problem.

781
00:42:31,917 --> 00:42:34,918
¶¶

782
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,686
What are you doing?

783
00:42:36,688 --> 00:42:38,588
I'm making a sound effect.

784
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:40,323
No superhero can use his powers

785
00:42:40,325 --> 00:42:42,559
without a good sound effect
in the background.

786
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:45,061
Come on, help me out. Really?

787
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:46,763
I'm not doing it without...

788
00:42:46,765 --> 00:42:48,865
All right. Okay.

789
00:42:48,867 --> 00:42:51,935
¶¶

790
00:42:57,242 --> 00:42:58,641
Hey, you did it!

791
00:42:58,643 --> 00:42:59,909
Yeah.

792
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:01,578
It's amazing I did
with all that racket

793
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:03,146
you were making
in the background.

794
00:43:03,148 --> 00:43:05,114
Couldn't hear myself think.

795
00:43:08,853 --> 00:43:10,153
Oh, great.

796
00:43:10,155 --> 00:43:12,172
The trunk just popped open.

797
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:14,190
I know. I've been trying
to fix it for the longest time,

798
00:43:14,192 --> 00:43:16,593
but I'm having a lot
of trouble with the latch.

799
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:25,134
There's a body bag,
but I can't make it out.

800
00:43:25,136 --> 00:43:27,203
Can you unzip the zipper?

801
00:43:33,244 --> 00:43:34,928
I still can't make it out.

802
00:43:34,929 --> 00:43:36,849
Maybe if you lift
the body up a little bit.

803
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:43,886
Seems to be caught
on something.

804
00:43:43,888 --> 00:43:47,824
Hold on. Let me give
it one good tug.

805
00:43:51,062 --> 00:43:52,161
Uh-oh.

806
00:43:54,332 --> 00:43:56,265
Eww!

807
00:43:56,267 --> 00:43:57,934
See how stiff it was?

808
00:43:57,936 --> 00:44:00,416
Yeah. Rigor mortis
must have kicked in.

809
00:44:38,076 --> 00:44:39,242
Hey! What happened?

810
00:44:39,244 --> 00:44:41,077
I thought we had
a mannequin back here.

811
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:42,245
We did.

812
00:44:42,247 --> 00:44:43,146
You don'tsuppose
that he escaped

813
00:44:43,148 --> 00:44:45,314
and he's gonna turn us in?

814
00:44:45,316 --> 00:44:46,949
You know what?

815
00:44:46,951 --> 00:44:48,351
You're depriving
some village of its idiot.

816
00:44:48,353 --> 00:44:49,819
Okay? Now, come on.

817
00:44:49,821 --> 00:44:51,688
Get the stuff out of here.

818
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:53,856
Looks like they're
getting rid of the evidence.

819
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:55,892
I want to see
what's in that bag.

820
00:44:55,894 --> 00:45:00,697
You know, this vehicle
can camouflage itself.

821
00:45:00,699 --> 00:45:04,033
Let's just wait
until after they leave.

822
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:05,802
Are you kidding me?

823
00:45:05,804 --> 00:45:07,937
We have a cloaking device?

824
00:45:07,939 --> 00:45:12,175
Number One,
ready the cloaking device.

825
00:45:12,177 --> 00:45:13,342
Engage.

826
00:45:17,716 --> 00:45:20,049
1, 2, 3.

827
00:45:33,198 --> 00:45:35,131
Schmucks.

828
00:45:45,744 --> 00:45:47,210
Herman, when you said
the vehicle

829
00:45:47,212 --> 00:45:49,078
could camouflage itself,
this isn't exactly

830
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,080
what I had in mind.

831
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,081
You're right! I forgot
to paint our faces!

832
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:54,884
Eyes closed.

833
00:45:54,886 --> 00:45:56,919
Wait.

834
00:45:56,921 --> 00:45:58,154
Wait right here.

835
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:22,845
<i>There's something strange</i>
<i>about all this.</i>

836
00:46:22,847 --> 00:46:25,915
<i>Take some time to
figure out what to do.</i>

837
00:46:25,917 --> 00:46:27,416
Whoo! It's mine!

838
00:46:27,418 --> 00:46:29,252
I'm rich! It's all mine.

839
00:46:30,321 --> 00:46:32,955
Is everything all right?
What's in the bag?

840
00:46:32,957 --> 00:46:34,457
Mind your own business!

841
00:46:37,262 --> 00:46:38,261
Stuck.

842
00:46:38,263 --> 00:46:39,962
They're all mine.

843
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:42,131
I'm rich!

844
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:43,266
Huh?

845
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:46,435
So, do we got something
on the judge?

846
00:46:46,437 --> 00:46:48,371
Oh, yeah. You bet we do. What?

847
00:46:48,373 --> 00:46:50,373
Littering.

848
00:46:51,409 --> 00:46:52,408
Littering?

849
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:54,811
Hey, it's no joke.

850
00:46:54,813 --> 00:46:56,279
Littering!

851
00:46:56,281 --> 00:46:59,382
Wow! That scumbag!

852
00:46:59,384 --> 00:47:01,417
Yeah!

853
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:06,989
Well, lookie here.

854
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:09,458
Look who decided
to join the party.

855
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:11,360
I've been trying to get
in touch with you.

856
00:47:11,362 --> 00:47:12,461
Your suit's done.

857
00:47:12,463 --> 00:47:14,864
My suit? Really?

858
00:47:14,866 --> 00:47:16,599
Tell him, Edward.

859
00:47:16,601 --> 00:47:18,367
Oh. Oh, yeah.

860
00:47:18,369 --> 00:47:21,504
Um, I gotta tell you
about today.

861
00:47:21,506 --> 00:47:23,406
Well, we were
at the Laundromat...

862
00:47:23,408 --> 00:47:26,108
And Ed stripped down
to his boxers.

863
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:27,343
Oh, this should be good.

864
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:28,511
Brainard.

865
00:47:28,513 --> 00:47:31,080
What? You did.

866
00:47:31,082 --> 00:47:33,149
Anyway, we're following
this limo, right?

867
00:47:33,151 --> 00:47:35,351
And lo and behold... Look,
Ed, why don't you and Robo

868
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:36,953
go on down there and try
your suits on, okay?

869
00:47:36,955 --> 00:47:38,521
I gotta take this phone call.

870
00:47:38,523 --> 00:47:40,323
And when y'all get back up,
we'll talk about it, okay?

871
00:47:40,325 --> 00:47:41,958
Oh, yeah. No. Sure.

872
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,359
No harm done.

873
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:44,861
All right, listen, Herman.

874
00:47:44,863 --> 00:47:46,495
Not a peep until I get back.

875
00:47:46,497 --> 00:47:48,197
I want to see
the look on their faces.

876
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:49,599
Oh, yeah.

877
00:47:49,601 --> 00:47:52,501
The sanitation engineers
will be giddy.

878
00:47:52,503 --> 00:47:54,270
I'm calling Mom.

879
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,407
Let's take the
elevator, girly-man,

880
00:47:58,409 --> 00:47:59,689
look at your new suit.

881
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:07,350
Wow!

882
00:48:07,352 --> 00:48:09,051
Look at this place!

883
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:11,187
Well, the cat's out
of the bag, Herbert.

884
00:48:11,189 --> 00:48:13,389
We know where you
get your inspiration.

885
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:16,359
Herbert?

886
00:48:16,361 --> 00:48:18,194
Why don't you call his name

887
00:48:18,196 --> 00:48:20,930
like you got a pair, girly-man?

888
00:48:20,932 --> 00:48:22,999
Hmm? Q!

889
00:48:23,001 --> 00:48:24,367
Pretty good, huh?

890
00:48:24,369 --> 00:48:26,435
Oh. Sorry.
Didn't hear you come in.

891
00:48:26,437 --> 00:48:29,138
Here to see your outfit, are you?
Yeah.

892
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:32,008
Well, I think you'll love this.

893
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:33,442
Although I have to admit,

894
00:48:33,444 --> 00:48:35,178
I did have some problems.

895
00:48:35,179 --> 00:48:36,913
Hey, you got one
beautiful-looking blue eye.

896
00:48:36,915 --> 00:48:38,681
What say you and I go
split a can of 30-weight...

897
00:48:38,683 --> 00:48:40,116
Hey, you... With detergent?

898
00:48:40,118 --> 00:48:42,585
Felicia?

899
00:48:42,587 --> 00:48:47,089
I'm... I'm normally
not this forward, but...

900
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:49,425
you're different than the rest.

901
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:52,495
Maybe it's your faith
or that bumbling charm,

902
00:48:52,497 --> 00:48:56,432
but I respect a hero

903
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:59,302
who stands by
what he believes in.

904
00:48:59,304 --> 00:49:00,670
It shows a great deal
of innocence

905
00:49:00,672 --> 00:49:03,406
that cannot be
corrupted by evil.

906
00:49:03,408 --> 00:49:06,042
<i>Aw, crap. She's onto me.</i>

907
00:49:06,044 --> 00:49:08,344
And I... I wanted
to help Herbert

908
00:49:08,346 --> 00:49:11,480
put some of that pureness

909
00:49:11,482 --> 00:49:14,517
into your... costume.

910
00:49:18,056 --> 00:49:19,188
Herbert!

911
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:20,723
Oh. How'd that get there?

912
00:49:20,725 --> 00:49:21,991
Sorry.

913
00:49:26,497 --> 00:49:29,165
Q! Felicia!

914
00:49:31,502 --> 00:49:33,569
I don't know what to say.

915
00:49:33,571 --> 00:49:35,504
You should try it on.

916
00:49:35,506 --> 00:49:37,573
Felicia...

917
00:49:38,509 --> 00:49:40,176
Yes, Ed?

918
00:49:42,146 --> 00:49:45,414
Well... gotta go.

919
00:49:45,416 --> 00:49:46,716
This is the part of the story

920
00:49:46,718 --> 00:49:48,317
that usually turns to mush.

921
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:49,618
Well, I have many, many hours

922
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:51,554
of countless
inspirational films

923
00:49:51,556 --> 00:49:52,989
that we have to watch.

924
00:49:52,991 --> 00:49:54,490
Come on, Robo.

925
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:57,193
<i>Hasta la vista,</i> girly-man.

926
00:49:58,196 --> 00:49:59,195
Ooh!

927
00:49:59,197 --> 00:50:00,930
Ow.

928
00:50:00,931 --> 00:50:02,664
What kind of a name
is "Gruberman," anyway?

929
00:50:02,667 --> 00:50:03,766
I don't know.

930
00:50:03,768 --> 00:50:05,167
As you were saying?

931
00:50:05,169 --> 00:50:06,702
Felicia...

932
00:50:08,473 --> 00:50:11,107
I've been noticing you, too.

933
00:50:12,643 --> 00:50:15,011
Whenever you're around, I...

934
00:50:15,013 --> 00:50:16,479
I get this feeling of warmth.

935
00:50:16,481 --> 00:50:18,647
Really?

936
00:50:18,649 --> 00:50:21,183
Tell me more.

937
00:50:21,185 --> 00:50:24,020
I mean, I know
they say you have

938
00:50:24,022 --> 00:50:26,155
the power to freeze... Mm-hmm.

939
00:50:26,157 --> 00:50:29,692
...and that you're a cold
and heartless woman...

940
00:50:29,694 --> 00:50:33,429
And, oh, I saw the men behind
your back make fun of you.

941
00:50:33,431 --> 00:50:35,131
They call you Ice Queen.

942
00:50:35,133 --> 00:50:37,233
And we even have
this "Grrr" sign we do

943
00:50:37,235 --> 00:50:38,267
that is actually quite funny.

944
00:50:38,269 --> 00:50:39,568
Shh!

945
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:42,010
Maybe you just shouldn't talk.

946
00:50:43,207 --> 00:50:44,273
Mmm.

947
00:50:44,275 --> 00:50:46,175
Everyone's gonna be so jealous!

948
00:50:49,514 --> 00:50:51,647
So, Felicia, um,

949
00:50:51,649 --> 00:50:53,416
how about you don't
freeze my head anymore?

950
00:50:53,418 --> 00:50:55,985
I think it causes brain damage.

951
00:50:55,986 --> 00:50:58,553
That would require
a brain to damage.

952
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:04,393
Ta-da! What...
What do you think?

953
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:06,228
Wow.

954
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:08,431
You really do have
an inner glow about you.

955
00:51:08,433 --> 00:51:10,699
Well, let's go kick
some evil butt, huh?

956
00:51:10,701 --> 00:51:13,602
Oh. And by the way,
I heard what you said.

957
00:51:13,604 --> 00:51:15,371
What did I say?

958
00:51:15,373 --> 00:51:17,706
Yeah, I don't know.
But you said something.

959
00:51:17,708 --> 00:51:19,108
Maybe it's that brain damage.

960
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:20,709
You know, it clogs the ears.

961
00:51:20,711 --> 00:51:23,546
Reawr!

962
00:51:23,548 --> 00:51:25,281
Not funny, Ed.

963
00:51:25,283 --> 00:51:27,564
It's not funny at all.

964
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:39,161
Hey, look at the Super Gruber.

965
00:51:39,163 --> 00:51:42,231
Ooh! Where have you two been?

966
00:51:42,233 --> 00:51:45,301
New suit, huh?
Bet it's dry-clean only.

967
00:51:45,303 --> 00:51:48,437
Um, actually, it's 100%
anti-glare leather,

968
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:49,839
so I look good
even when I'm fighting.

969
00:51:49,841 --> 00:51:51,540
Wooah!

970
00:51:51,542 --> 00:51:53,676
Listen, just because
you got a fancy new suit

971
00:51:53,678 --> 00:51:55,444
doesn't mean that
you're number one.

972
00:51:55,446 --> 00:51:57,279
You know, people will
always look up to me.

973
00:51:57,281 --> 00:51:58,647
I am Will Powers.

974
00:51:58,649 --> 00:52:00,416
That is my picture on the wall.

975
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:03,252
Hey!

976
00:52:03,254 --> 00:52:06,455
<i>...10-month-long</i>
<i>investigation...</i>

977
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:08,390
Look, that's us on TV.

978
00:52:08,392 --> 00:52:10,309
<i>What we found may shock you.</i>

979
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:12,227
<i>It will almost certainly</i>
<i>make you think twice</i>

980
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:14,497
<i>before ordering</i>

981
00:52:14,499 --> 00:52:17,600

982
00:52:17,602 --> 00:52:18,634
<i>Last week's robbery</i>

983
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:20,236
<i>on the Main Street Bridge</i>

984
00:52:20,238 --> 00:52:22,838
<i>was interrupted by</i>
<i>the heroic Super Capers.</i>

985
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,808
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>cleaned up the scene,</i>

986
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:28,744
<i>there were still $20 million</i>
<i>worth of gold bars</i>

987
00:52:28,746 --> 00:52:30,579
<i>that were unaccounted for.</i>

988
00:52:30,581 --> 00:52:32,448
<i>Now, speculations have led</i>

989
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:34,183
<i>to Captains Sludge and Cretan</i>

990
00:52:34,185 --> 00:52:36,619
<i>taking off with them</i>
<i>during their escape.</i>

991
00:52:36,621 --> 00:52:39,555
<i>However, the suspects are</i>
<i>still nowhere to be found.</i>

992
00:52:39,557 --> 00:52:42,191
<i>When asked about the reason</i>
<i>for the villains' escape,</i>

993
00:52:42,193 --> 00:52:44,660
<i>this is what local</i>

994
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:45,794
<i>Hi, Mom!</i>

995
00:52:45,796 --> 00:52:47,229
<i>We're on air.</i>

996
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:49,482
<i>Oh. Sorry.</i>

997
00:52:49,483 --> 00:52:51,734
<i>Yeah, so me and the guys</i>
<i>were about to stop Cretan.</i>

998
00:52:51,736 --> 00:52:53,769
<i>Then this new superhero,</i>
<i>Ed Gruberman, said,</i>

999
00:52:53,771 --> 00:52:55,871
<i>"Nah. We have to keep</i>
<i>the viewer interested."</i>

1000
00:52:55,873 --> 00:52:57,473
<i>Or something like that.</i>

1001
00:52:57,475 --> 00:52:59,408
<i>Didn't really make</i>
<i>much sense to me.</i>

1002
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:01,410
<i>Then he asked me</i>
<i>if I wanted his autograph,</i>

1003
00:53:01,412 --> 00:53:03,573
<i>like he was a celebrity</i>
<i>of something.</i>

1004
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:07,917
<i>Okay. Well, there you have it.</i>

1005
00:53:07,919 --> 00:53:10,319
<i>And, Ed Gruberman,</i>
<i>if you're out there</i>

1006
00:53:10,321 --> 00:53:12,254
<i>and you're watching,</i>
<i>thanks for letting</i>

1007
00:53:12,256 --> 00:53:14,190
<i>the bad guys get away,</i>
<i>you moron.</i>

1008
00:53:14,192 --> 00:53:15,624
That can't be good.

1009
00:53:15,626 --> 00:53:17,960
Mr. Gruberman.

1010
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:22,831
I am Special Agent Smith.

1011
00:53:22,833 --> 00:53:27,336
This is my partner
and twin brother.

1012
00:53:27,338 --> 00:53:29,805
Special Agent Smith 2.

1013
00:53:30,841 --> 00:53:32,841
Yeah.

1014
00:53:32,843 --> 00:53:36,845
We just saw
the news special on TV,

1015
00:53:36,847 --> 00:53:39,215
and we are placing you
under arrest

1016
00:53:39,217 --> 00:53:41,684
for the theft
of the missing bouillon.

1017
00:53:41,686 --> 00:53:42,952
Yeah!

1018
00:53:42,954 --> 00:53:45,854
I told you to stop that.

1019
00:53:45,856 --> 00:53:47,856
Wow. You guys are fast.

1020
00:53:47,858 --> 00:53:50,226
Um, seriously, though,
I need to talk to you.

1021
00:53:50,228 --> 00:53:51,827
Hey, listen up!

1022
00:53:52,863 --> 00:53:54,797
I run this misfit operation.

1023
00:53:54,799 --> 00:53:57,566
You can't just come barge in
here, arresting who you want.

1024
00:53:57,568 --> 00:54:00,369
And besides, it'd be
a cold day in hell

1025
00:54:00,371 --> 00:54:01,770
before I believe Ed's a thief.

1026
00:54:01,772 --> 00:54:03,806
<i>That-a-boy, Sarge.</i>
<i>You tell 'em.</i>

1027
00:54:03,808 --> 00:54:04,940
Yeah. You know?

1028
00:54:04,942 --> 00:54:06,575
It's exactly
like the Sarge said...

1029
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:08,844
I've never stole
anything in my life.

1030
00:54:08,846 --> 00:54:11,747
Never stolen anything, hmm?

1031
00:54:12,717 --> 00:54:16,585
"Property of
Warner Bros. Studios"?

1032
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:18,954
Wait. No! Q!

1033
00:54:20,958 --> 00:54:22,691
Aw, crap.

1034
00:54:22,693 --> 00:54:25,661
We received
an anonymous tip today

1035
00:54:25,663 --> 00:54:28,864
regarding the whereabouts
of the missing bouillon.

1036
00:54:28,866 --> 00:54:29,798
Yeah.

1037
00:54:32,036 --> 00:54:34,903
We followed up on said call,

1038
00:54:34,905 --> 00:54:38,741
and we found this sign
by the side of the road,

1039
00:54:38,743 --> 00:54:41,877
right next to where the
missing bouillon was buried.

1040
00:54:41,879 --> 00:54:44,313
How could you be so stupid?

1041
00:54:44,315 --> 00:54:45,481
The devil made me do it.

1042
00:54:45,483 --> 00:54:47,934
Look, I was gonna give it back.

1043
00:54:47,935 --> 00:54:50,386
I mean, it's not like I can
go to a bank and cash it in.

1044
00:54:50,388 --> 00:54:52,855
So I don't suppose you have

1045
00:54:52,857 --> 00:54:55,391
any kind of
account number on you?

1046
00:54:55,393 --> 00:54:58,327
Actually, yes.
Yes, I do. Heh ha!

1047
00:54:59,864 --> 00:55:01,330
Ah.

1048
00:55:02,466 --> 00:55:04,833
Mm-hmm.

1049
00:55:04,835 --> 00:55:06,869
This is an offshore
account number

1050
00:55:06,871 --> 00:55:09,772
for the liquidation of gold.

1051
00:55:09,774 --> 00:55:13,942
Opened and signed...
huh... by you.

1052
00:55:20,851 --> 00:55:23,251
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1053
00:55:23,521 --> 00:55:25,921
This is your signature.

1054
00:55:25,923 --> 00:55:27,823
That...

1055
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:29,858
Well, that was my paycheck.

1056
00:55:30,895 --> 00:55:31,894
Aw, crap.

1057
00:55:31,896 --> 00:55:33,896
Well, you know, uh...

1058
00:55:33,898 --> 00:55:35,314
a little glue...

1059
00:55:35,315 --> 00:55:36,731
that's probably
gonna be just fine.

1060
00:55:36,734 --> 00:55:38,534
I'm sorry, Agents.

1061
00:55:38,536 --> 00:55:39,702
You need military clearance

1062
00:55:39,704 --> 00:55:41,503
to come in here
and arrest someone.

1063
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:43,639
Actually, we have it.

1064
00:55:43,641 --> 00:55:45,507
We also have
orders from the top

1065
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:47,609
to shut Super Capers down,

1066
00:55:47,611 --> 00:55:49,912
effective immediately,

1067
00:55:49,914 --> 00:55:52,481
pending further investigation.

1068
00:55:52,483 --> 00:55:54,583
So we are placing
you all under arrest

1069
00:55:54,585 --> 00:55:56,385
on the theory
of your involvement

1070
00:55:56,387 --> 00:55:58,821
in the missing bouillon.

1071
00:55:58,823 --> 00:56:00,723
Well, unfortunately,

1072
00:56:00,725 --> 00:56:02,791
I still can't
let you arrest Ed.

1073
00:56:02,793 --> 00:56:05,527
Yeah! You tell 'em, Sarge.

1074
00:56:05,529 --> 00:56:07,830
Because I'm gonna kill him!

1075
00:56:07,832 --> 00:56:09,765
Aaahh! Sarge!

1076
00:56:09,767 --> 00:56:11,467
Please, you gotta believe me!

1077
00:56:11,469 --> 00:56:12,868
Agent guards!

1078
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:14,336
Everybody in!

1079
00:56:14,337 --> 00:56:15,803
Two by twos. All right,
let's round them up.

1080
00:56:15,806 --> 00:56:17,005
Put them all in the van.

1081
00:56:17,007 --> 00:56:18,474
Yeah.

1082
00:56:19,744 --> 00:56:21,643
Your RV is also being impounded

1083
00:56:21,645 --> 00:56:23,712
for further investigation.

1084
00:56:23,714 --> 00:56:27,549
Hey, nobody fight back, man.

1085
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:28,717
Just do what they say.

1086
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:29,985
We'll get this all worked out.

1087
00:56:29,987 --> 00:56:31,887
Will. Will,
you gotta believe me.

1088
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:33,555
It's the judge.
He's framing me.

1089
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:36,392
Sure, he is. Here's an idea.

1090
00:56:36,394 --> 00:56:39,561
Why don't you just tell it
to the judge, klepto boy?

1091
00:56:39,563 --> 00:56:41,029
Oh, sorry.

1092
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:43,899
Lies!

1093
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:45,968
All lies!

1094
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:49,972
Sarge. Listen, Sarge.

1095
00:56:49,974 --> 00:56:53,675
Now I know why Cretan
and Sludge got let go.

1096
00:56:56,046 --> 00:56:57,880
Everybody, back to the van.

1097
00:56:57,882 --> 00:56:59,882
Felicia. Felicia, please...

1098
00:56:59,884 --> 00:57:01,650
Don't ever talk to me again.

1099
00:57:01,652 --> 00:57:02,918
I thought you were different.

1100
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:05,120
I'm gonna fix all this,
I promise!

1101
00:57:05,122 --> 00:57:07,122
Lies!

1102
00:57:07,124 --> 00:57:08,857
Lies!

1103
00:57:10,027 --> 00:57:12,060
Let me see your hands. Hands?

1104
00:57:12,062 --> 00:57:14,763
For the handcuffs.
You're going to prison.

1105
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:15,798
Oh, boy.

1106
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:16,965
Oh, great.

1107
00:57:16,967 --> 00:57:18,467
Agent Smith.

1108
00:57:18,469 --> 00:57:22,070
Just roll him out of here.

1109
00:57:27,478 --> 00:57:29,545
It'll be all right, Puffer Boy.

1110
00:57:29,547 --> 00:57:32,014
But I don't wanna be a chicken!

1111
00:57:32,016 --> 00:57:33,682
Ow! I say!

1112
00:57:33,684 --> 00:57:35,751
This is an outrage!

1113
00:57:35,753 --> 00:57:37,920
Nobody ever arrests
the sidekicks!

1114
00:57:37,922 --> 00:57:39,521
Get him, Robo!

1115
00:57:39,523 --> 00:57:41,957
Ooh! Are you scared to pick
on a man your own size?

1116
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:43,192
I'll show you how to pick...

1117
00:57:43,194 --> 00:57:45,194
Get him outta here right now!
Let's go!

1118
00:57:45,196 --> 00:57:48,096
Ed, I'm going
to crush you... later!

1119
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:51,099
I've got an itch.
Can you scratch me right...

1120
00:57:51,101 --> 00:57:53,135
At least the little guy
called me Ed.

1121
00:57:55,072 --> 00:57:57,806
Not you... Ed.

1122
00:57:57,808 --> 00:57:59,041
You're coming with us.

1123
00:57:59,043 --> 00:58:00,476
What?

1124
00:58:00,478 --> 00:58:02,044
Yeah.

1125
00:58:14,124 --> 00:58:16,992
Okay, they're all
accounted for.

1126
00:58:16,994 --> 00:58:19,027
We're bringing in Ed.

1127
00:58:20,197 --> 00:58:24,099
The rest of them will be...

1128
00:58:24,101 --> 00:58:27,903
taken care of, as you ordered.

1129
00:59:05,175 --> 00:59:07,009
Welcome to the judge's home.

1130
00:59:07,011 --> 00:59:08,577
Yeah.

1131
00:59:08,579 --> 00:59:10,112
This is what I've
been trying to say.

1132
00:59:10,114 --> 00:59:12,748
He's crooked.
I mean, look at this place.

1133
00:59:39,043 --> 00:59:40,909
Enjoy your stay.

1134
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:42,744
Yeah.

1135
00:59:42,746 --> 00:59:44,866
Would you stop that already?

1136
00:59:47,051 --> 00:59:49,851
You've been a naughty boy.

1137
00:59:49,853 --> 00:59:52,087
Red?

1138
00:59:52,089 --> 00:59:55,223
Red, where have you been?

1139
00:59:55,225 --> 00:59:56,826
Did you know I was
sentenced by the judge

1140
00:59:56,827 --> 00:59:58,160
to become a superhero?

1141
00:59:58,162 --> 01:00:00,629
And then it ends up
he's a villain

1142
01:00:00,631 --> 01:00:02,097
and those agents work for him.

1143
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:05,267
Plus, I'm not sure
they're really twins.

1144
01:00:05,269 --> 01:00:06,602
No.

1145
01:00:06,604 --> 01:00:08,070
Yeah.

1146
01:00:08,072 --> 01:00:09,371
Look at this place.

1147
01:00:09,373 --> 01:00:11,940
All bought with dirty money.

1148
01:00:13,143 --> 01:00:15,611
You read comic books.
You watch TV shows.

1149
01:00:15,613 --> 01:00:17,613
This place doesn't
look at all familiar?

1150
01:00:20,618 --> 01:00:22,117
You're right!

1151
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:24,219
I should've
noticed this sooner!

1152
01:00:24,221 --> 01:00:27,255
This belongs
to the Dark Winged Vesper!

1153
01:00:27,257 --> 01:00:30,359
In... In comic issue 51,
he... he fought

1154
01:00:30,361 --> 01:00:33,228
the creature from Area 51
right in this very room.

1155
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:37,132
This is his mansion! Wow!

1156
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:39,968
When the Dark Winged Vesper
finds out that the judge

1157
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:42,170
has taken over
his mansion, hoo!

1158
01:00:42,172 --> 01:00:44,973
He is going to be upset.

1159
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:47,242
No worries now.

1160
01:00:47,244 --> 01:00:50,746
You adorable idiot.

1161
01:00:52,282 --> 01:00:53,815
News flash.

1162
01:00:53,817 --> 01:00:56,985
Bernard Raymond III
is the Dark Winged Vesper.

1163
01:00:56,987 --> 01:01:00,122
Then who's the judge?

1164
01:01:00,124 --> 01:01:03,158
The judge is
the Dark Winged Vesper.

1165
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,260
Talk about
your identity crisis.

1166
01:01:05,262 --> 01:01:06,328
Which is it?

1167
01:01:07,231 --> 01:01:08,830
Shh. There's more.

1168
01:01:20,144 --> 01:01:21,910
I know that suit.

1169
01:01:24,314 --> 01:01:26,448
The person who
killed my parents

1170
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:29,785
was wearing
that black spandex suit.

1171
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:32,187
Why?

1172
01:01:32,189 --> 01:01:33,255
Because they were all out

1173
01:01:33,257 --> 01:01:35,957
of the pink suits that day.

1174
01:01:45,202 --> 01:01:47,903
You disappeared
for all these years.

1175
01:01:47,905 --> 01:01:50,225
I thought someone
had finally gotten you.

1176
01:01:51,175 --> 01:01:53,341
I looked up to you.

1177
01:01:53,343 --> 01:01:55,177
I wanted to be you.

1178
01:01:55,179 --> 01:01:58,113
And you said Ihad
the identity crisis.

1179
01:01:58,115 --> 01:02:00,782
Your boxers probably
got my name on them.

1180
01:02:00,784 --> 01:02:03,218
Ha! Wrong.

1181
01:02:04,722 --> 01:02:06,254
They say "Jesus Loves Me."

1182
01:02:06,256 --> 01:02:09,357
No, Ed. Look down.

1183
01:02:12,029 --> 01:02:13,028
Aw, crap.

1184
01:02:13,030 --> 01:02:14,496
Ooh.

1185
01:02:14,498 --> 01:02:15,864
Boxers.

1186
01:02:17,201 --> 01:02:19,201
Red.

1187
01:02:19,203 --> 01:02:20,836
Do you mind? Can we be alone?

1188
01:02:20,838 --> 01:02:22,918
Don't you have some
business to attend to?

1189
01:02:33,817 --> 01:02:36,218
I love it when she does that.

1190
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:38,887
Look, Ed. I really like you.

1191
01:02:38,889 --> 01:02:41,189
So do what he says,

1192
01:02:41,191 --> 01:02:44,159
and we can have a night
beyond your imagination.

1193
01:02:44,161 --> 01:02:46,061
Ohh!

1194
01:02:46,063 --> 01:02:48,263
Yeah.

1195
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:51,099
Don't listen to her.
She's obviously a villain.

1196
01:02:51,101 --> 01:02:52,768
And besides,
you're in love now...

1197
01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:54,936
with your lady in blue.

1198
01:02:54,938 --> 01:02:56,471
Do you always talk to yourself?

1199
01:02:57,374 --> 01:02:59,541
Crap. Meant to use
my inside voice.

1200
01:02:59,543 --> 01:03:02,410
Red! It's time.

1201
01:03:02,412 --> 01:03:04,246
Well, no matter.

1202
01:03:04,248 --> 01:03:06,381
Your lady in blue won't
be around long enough

1203
01:03:06,383 --> 01:03:08,083
for you to fall in love
with her, anyway.

1204
01:03:08,085 --> 01:03:09,351
What are you gonna do?

1205
01:03:09,353 --> 01:03:11,486
Why, kill all your
friends, of course.

1206
01:03:11,488 --> 01:03:12,854
What? Wait! Why?

1207
01:03:12,856 --> 01:03:14,422
<i>Ciao.</i>

1208
01:03:14,424 --> 01:03:16,057
You've gotta stop her.

1209
01:03:16,059 --> 01:03:17,959
Stop her?

1210
01:03:17,961 --> 01:03:20,395
Do you even know
why you're here?

1211
01:03:20,397 --> 01:03:22,397
Do you even know
how you got here?

1212
01:03:22,399 --> 01:03:25,400
Yeah. Your two goons
hauled me in here.

1213
01:03:25,402 --> 01:03:27,335
I don't think they're twins.

1214
01:03:28,806 --> 01:03:31,306
Do you know you're a
big part of my plan?

1215
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:32,974
Right from the start?

1216
01:03:32,976 --> 01:03:34,509
<i>I had Red set you up</i>

1217
01:03:34,511 --> 01:03:37,479
<i>so you'd end up</i>
<i>in my courtroom.</i>

1218
01:03:37,481 --> 01:03:40,182
<i>I got your signature from you
that day so I could open up</i>

1219
01:03:40,184 --> 01:03:42,417
<i>an offshore account</i>
<i>in your name.</i>

1220
01:03:42,419 --> 01:03:44,286
<i>I placed the account number</i>
<i>in your back pocket</i>

1221
01:03:44,288 --> 01:03:45,488
<i>that day we were on the bridge</i>

1222
01:03:45,489 --> 01:03:47,923
<i>when I patted you on the back.</i>

1223
01:03:47,925 --> 01:03:50,192
<i>Then you followed us</i>
<i>to where I left the evidence</i>

1224
01:03:50,194 --> 01:03:52,035
<i>that I wanted</i>
<i>the police to find.</i>

1225
01:03:53,363 --> 01:03:54,963
But you didn't go to the cops.

1226
01:03:54,965 --> 01:03:57,165
Not yet.

1227
01:03:57,167 --> 01:03:58,466
Consider it blackmail.

1228
01:03:59,536 --> 01:04:01,436
What do you want?

1229
01:04:01,438 --> 01:04:04,472
What every good story needs:

1230
01:04:04,474 --> 01:04:07,008
A villain who tries
to get the good guy

1231
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:10,045
to come over
to the dark side, Ed.

1232
01:04:11,348 --> 01:04:13,081
So...

1233
01:04:13,083 --> 01:04:15,217
you want me to help you
find a good guy.

1234
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:18,854
It's not gonna be easy.
It's tough out there.

1235
01:04:18,856 --> 01:04:20,922
Does it have to be a guy?

1236
01:04:20,924 --> 01:04:23,425
Because there's Mrs. Fincher.
She's, like, 80, but...

1237
01:04:23,427 --> 01:04:24,492
No! Ed!

1238
01:04:25,529 --> 01:04:27,896
You're the good guy.

1239
01:04:29,132 --> 01:04:30,799
Me?

1240
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:32,467
Well, then why are you
gonna kill my friends?

1241
01:04:32,469 --> 01:04:36,204
Man, what else is there
to do on a Tuesday night?

1242
01:04:36,206 --> 01:04:38,373
Some people just
have to be sacrificed.

1243
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:41,009
Now, on a lighter note,

1244
01:04:41,011 --> 01:04:43,411
can you deny
the excitement you felt

1245
01:04:43,413 --> 01:04:47,249
when you held all that gold
in your hands? Hmm?

1246
01:04:47,251 --> 01:04:48,884
Give me a chance, Ed.

1247
01:04:48,886 --> 01:04:50,952
I can teach you how
to acquire such wealth

1248
01:04:50,954 --> 01:04:53,655
and show you how to enjoy it.

1249
01:04:55,259 --> 01:04:56,391
You must realize

1250
01:04:56,393 --> 01:04:58,126
that the Dark Winged Vesper

1251
01:04:58,128 --> 01:05:02,163
someday will need a hero
to take his place.

1252
01:05:04,534 --> 01:05:07,535
You, Ed.

1253
01:05:07,537 --> 01:05:09,671
You could be that hero.

1254
01:05:11,541 --> 01:05:14,075
Hmm. Now, come.

1255
01:05:14,077 --> 01:05:15,977
Look out the window

1256
01:05:15,979 --> 01:05:19,547
and watch the end of your
Super Caper friends.

1257
01:05:19,549 --> 01:05:23,184
Don't chose
the same fate, my boy.

1258
01:05:24,388 --> 01:05:25,987
Come.

1259
01:05:33,563 --> 01:05:35,096
Something is not right.

1260
01:05:35,098 --> 01:05:37,132
I just have
this horrible feeling

1261
01:05:37,134 --> 01:05:38,400
that Ed is innocent.

1262
01:05:38,402 --> 01:05:41,102
Well, you know...
For the record,

1263
01:05:41,104 --> 01:05:44,572
I'd just like to say Ed's
costume might've been borrowed.

1264
01:05:44,574 --> 01:05:45,540
And not very attractive.

1265
01:05:45,542 --> 01:05:47,609
We did chase the judge

1266
01:05:47,611 --> 01:05:51,079
with an unexplained
body bag in his trunk.

1267
01:05:51,081 --> 01:05:53,281
I can't believe
what I'm hearing.

1268
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:56,618
Trust me, innocence is not
one of Ed's abilities.

1269
01:05:56,620 --> 01:05:58,553
I saw him eyeing
the joint from day one.

1270
01:05:58,555 --> 01:06:01,022
They'll realize that
they made a mistake.

1271
01:06:01,024 --> 01:06:02,357
They'll unlock these doors,

1272
01:06:02,359 --> 01:06:03,680
and everything
is gonna be fine.

1273
01:06:04,528 --> 01:06:06,461
See? What'd I tell ya?

1274
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:08,730
Huh? I'm surrounded by idiots.

1275
01:06:08,732 --> 01:06:11,533
Hello, boys. Remember me? Uh-oh.

1276
01:06:11,535 --> 01:06:13,468
It seems the judge has given me

1277
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:17,072
the opportunity to end
all of your pathetic lives!

1278
01:06:17,074 --> 01:06:18,373
We're toast. Oh, crap.

1279
01:06:18,375 --> 01:06:20,075
Maybe Ed is number one.

1280
01:06:20,077 --> 01:06:22,177
Out!

1281
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:33,488
All righty!

1282
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:35,657
Now is the part
where we finish you...

1283
01:06:35,659 --> 01:06:37,125
...once and for all.

1284
01:06:37,127 --> 01:06:38,293
You're wrong.

1285
01:06:38,295 --> 01:06:41,496
I can make this place
look like a blizzard.

1286
01:06:41,498 --> 01:06:43,231
Ooh! Aah!

1287
01:06:43,233 --> 01:06:44,632
Ohh!

1288
01:06:44,634 --> 01:06:46,634
Oh. No, I'm okay. I'm okay.

1289
01:06:46,636 --> 01:06:49,204
Just knocked the wind outta me.
Hmm.

1290
01:06:49,206 --> 01:06:52,173
Never was one for cold weather.

1291
01:06:52,175 --> 01:06:54,476
Probably why I like
living in Alaska.

1292
01:06:54,478 --> 01:06:56,644
Definitely doesn't have
super intelligence. No.

1293
01:06:56,646 --> 01:06:59,581
I'm talking about global
warming, you pea brain.

1294
01:06:59,583 --> 01:07:01,784
You think humans
really cause all of that?

1295
01:07:01,785 --> 01:07:03,018
Oh.

1296
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:04,619
Oh! Doesn't matter.

1297
01:07:04,621 --> 01:07:07,622
None of you are gonna be around
long enough to see it, anyway.

1298
01:07:07,624 --> 01:07:10,592
Well, except for me
because, uh,

1299
01:07:10,594 --> 01:07:13,128
you find me
irresistible, right?

1300
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:15,030
Especially you...

1301
01:07:15,032 --> 01:07:16,164
old-timer.

1302
01:07:17,501 --> 01:07:20,568
I am sick and tired
of people calling me

1303
01:07:20,570 --> 01:07:24,039
old and fat!

1304
01:07:24,041 --> 01:07:25,673
Aah! Uhh!

1305
01:07:27,544 --> 01:07:30,045
Kill them! Kill them all!

1306
01:07:35,786 --> 01:07:37,752
A little music to set the mood.

1307
01:07:37,754 --> 01:07:40,622
<i>¶ Will Powers, we
love you ¶</i> Get them!

1308
01:07:45,362 --> 01:07:47,562
I gotta go help Ed.

1309
01:07:47,564 --> 01:07:49,597
Go get him.

1310
01:07:59,409 --> 01:08:03,845
I am looking forward
to completing your training.

1311
01:08:03,847 --> 01:08:05,647
In time...

1312
01:08:05,649 --> 01:08:08,616
you will call me Master.

1313
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:12,253
You're wrong.

1314
01:08:12,255 --> 01:08:14,856
Soon, I'll be dead,
and you with me.

1315
01:08:14,858 --> 01:08:17,559
<i>Wait. Did I just say that?</i>

1316
01:08:17,561 --> 01:08:19,794
<i>Seems awfully familiar.</i>

1317
01:08:19,796 --> 01:08:23,698
Uh, perhaps you refer

1318
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:25,700
to the imminent attack

1319
01:08:25,702 --> 01:08:29,404
on your Super Caper friends.

1320
01:08:29,406 --> 01:08:31,606
I assure you...

1321
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:33,741
we are quite safe

1322
01:08:33,743 --> 01:08:36,144
from your friends here.

1323
01:08:36,146 --> 01:08:38,580
Your overconfidence
is your weakness.

1324
01:08:38,582 --> 01:08:41,583
And your faith
in your friends is yours!

1325
01:08:41,585 --> 01:08:45,620
It is pointless
to resist, my son.

1326
01:08:45,622 --> 01:08:48,156
I knew it! What?

1327
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:51,192
Well, this is exactly like the
scene from <i> Return of the Jedi.</i>

1328
01:08:51,194 --> 01:08:53,595
I mean, next you'll be
telling me you're my father.

1329
01:08:53,597 --> 01:08:55,797
Actually, that part was<i> Empire.</i>

1330
01:08:55,799 --> 01:08:58,366
But yes...

1331
01:08:58,368 --> 01:09:01,703
I am your father.

1332
01:09:01,705 --> 01:09:03,304
Search your feelings, Ed.

1333
01:09:03,306 --> 01:09:05,406
You know it to be true.

1334
01:09:05,408 --> 01:09:06,508
No.

1335
01:09:07,911 --> 01:09:09,244
No.

1336
01:09:10,614 --> 01:09:12,280
It can't be true.

1337
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:14,749
That's impossible!

1338
01:09:14,751 --> 01:09:16,351
Enough!

1339
01:09:16,353 --> 01:09:20,488
Seriously!
It's so overdone, Ed!

1340
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:22,257
A long time ago...

1341
01:09:22,259 --> 01:09:24,592
In a galaxy far, far away.

1342
01:09:24,594 --> 01:09:27,195
I used to have a woman
working for me,

1343
01:09:27,197 --> 01:09:29,731
named Peggy.

1344
01:09:29,733 --> 01:09:31,699
We were intimate.

1345
01:09:31,701 --> 01:09:33,568
She became pregnant.

1346
01:09:33,569 --> 01:09:35,436
It was too dangerous to keep
the both of you around,

1347
01:09:35,438 --> 01:09:37,539
so I sent her off
to join the circus.

1348
01:09:37,541 --> 01:09:40,608
She always loved the circus.

1349
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:43,811
That's where she met
your stepfather, Mort.

1350
01:09:43,813 --> 01:09:45,513
That's where you killed them.

1351
01:09:45,515 --> 01:09:47,649
In my defense,
I just wanted to scare them.

1352
01:09:47,651 --> 01:09:49,817
It was a short yellow bus
that killed them.

1353
01:09:49,819 --> 01:09:51,519
Why?

1354
01:09:51,521 --> 01:09:53,588
To give you motivation.

1355
01:09:53,590 --> 01:09:55,857
It is one thing to want
to be a superhero.

1356
01:09:55,859 --> 01:10:00,195
It is another thing to want
to go after it for vengeance.

1357
01:10:00,197 --> 01:10:03,798
It brings out
the true evil in people.

1358
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:07,569
Now look how far
you came because of me.

1359
01:10:07,571 --> 01:10:10,638
Rule the world with me
as father and son!

1360
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,540
I'll never join you!

1361
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:13,975
God, this is ridiculous!

1362
01:10:13,977 --> 01:10:17,412
There is no way
you came from my loins.

1363
01:10:17,414 --> 01:10:19,314
You've got too much
of your mother in you.

1364
01:10:20,417 --> 01:10:22,483
And there was this
funny rumor that you...

1365
01:10:22,485 --> 01:10:23,885
you could talk to God.

1366
01:10:23,887 --> 01:10:26,387
I mean, like you got some power

1367
01:10:26,389 --> 01:10:27,622
with the man upstairs.

1368
01:10:27,624 --> 01:10:28,856
Huh?

1369
01:10:28,858 --> 01:10:30,758
Maybe I do.

1370
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:32,794
That is it! Agents!

1371
01:10:34,864 --> 01:10:36,331
Kill him!

1372
01:10:41,438 --> 01:10:44,405
Oh, why does a villain
always have to have

1373
01:10:44,407 --> 01:10:45,707
idiots working for him?

1374
01:10:45,709 --> 01:10:47,709
Is it a criteria?

1375
01:10:47,711 --> 01:10:50,311
No wonder the good guys
always win.

1376
01:10:51,348 --> 01:10:52,914
I'll just do it myself.

1377
01:10:52,916 --> 01:10:55,416
What?

1378
01:10:58,888 --> 01:11:01,823
Oh, that's just disgusting!

1379
01:11:05,362 --> 01:11:06,995
Make a run for it.

1380
01:11:06,997 --> 01:11:08,496
Go help the others.

1381
01:11:08,498 --> 01:11:09,831
Thanks, Puffer Boy.

1382
01:11:09,833 --> 01:11:11,432
Oh! I'll take care of him.

1383
01:11:11,434 --> 01:11:14,369
Stick Boy, prepare
to meet your maker.

1384
01:11:14,371 --> 01:11:16,838
You don't scare me.

1385
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:18,473
I'm not afraid of you.

1386
01:11:31,354 --> 01:11:34,322
Get out of my way!
I can't! I'm stuck!

1387
01:11:34,324 --> 01:11:36,724
Jump over me! Please!

1388
01:11:36,726 --> 01:11:38,760
Stop! Please!

1389
01:11:38,762 --> 01:11:39,961
Aw, crap...

1390
01:11:49,906 --> 01:11:50,905
Go!

1391
01:11:50,907 --> 01:11:52,674
Move out! Move out!

1392
01:11:52,676 --> 01:11:53,708
Come on!

1393
01:11:53,710 --> 01:11:54,842
Help me! Get back here!

1394
01:11:54,844 --> 01:11:56,044
You know, you would be
much stronger

1395
01:11:56,046 --> 01:11:57,879
if you just buy
my exercise DVD.

1396
01:11:57,881 --> 01:11:59,747
Ka-ching.

1397
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:02,917
<i>¶ Will Powers, we love you ¶</i>

1398
01:12:07,390 --> 01:12:08,856
Hold on!

1399
01:12:08,858 --> 01:12:09,924
Ha!

1400
01:12:11,861 --> 01:12:14,095
Did you feel the burn?

1401
01:12:14,097 --> 01:12:16,898
And now, girly-man,
I'll crush you!

1402
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:20,802
Well, now, allow me
to demonstrate

1403
01:12:20,804 --> 01:12:22,904
my newest product. What?

1404
01:12:22,906 --> 01:12:25,540
I call it a light sword.

1405
01:12:25,542 --> 01:12:27,862
Every true Super Caper
should have one.

1406
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:33,848
Great horny toads,
it needs some adjusting.

1407
01:12:35,051 --> 01:12:37,685
Get this stupid...

1408
01:12:37,687 --> 01:12:39,954
Leave me alone.

1409
01:12:39,956 --> 01:12:41,823
I just want my...

1410
01:12:45,895 --> 01:12:47,128
Oh, come on, you...

1411
01:12:55,004 --> 01:12:58,005
Mother always said,
too much ha-ha?

1412
01:12:58,007 --> 01:13:00,074
Pretty soon, boo-hoo.

1413
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:05,413
Boo-hoo.

1414
01:13:05,415 --> 01:13:08,416
Just one a minute.
Almost got it.

1415
01:13:10,053 --> 01:13:12,854
Almost done.
Just you unhand me!

1416
01:13:14,724 --> 01:13:17,425
I'm coming to get you!

1417
01:13:17,427 --> 01:13:20,387
Ya! Get 'em, Robo! Yeah, buddy!

1418
01:13:21,865 --> 01:13:22,997
Will!

1419
01:13:22,999 --> 01:13:24,599
Will, what can I do to help?

1420
01:13:24,601 --> 01:13:26,000
I got my hands full here.

1421
01:13:26,002 --> 01:13:28,002
Why don't you, uh,
go seek a higher power?

1422
01:13:28,004 --> 01:13:29,771
Aah! Do whatever you do.

1423
01:13:36,079 --> 01:13:38,413
Ed. I was wrong about you.

1424
01:13:38,415 --> 01:13:39,914
You are different
than the others.

1425
01:13:39,916 --> 01:13:42,183
You do have what it takes
to be a Super Caper,

1426
01:13:42,185 --> 01:13:44,952
and I believe in you.

1427
01:13:49,592 --> 01:13:51,492
Nasty.

1428
01:13:52,962 --> 01:13:55,029
Oooh...

1429
01:13:55,031 --> 01:13:56,063
I-I'll get help.

1430
01:13:58,034 --> 01:13:59,600
Careful with the RV, Ed.

1431
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:06,574
Agents! Someone is
trying to get away!

1432
01:14:10,713 --> 01:14:12,113
Got you now, Sludge!

1433
01:14:12,115 --> 01:14:14,549
Get away from me, Fatty!

1434
01:14:14,551 --> 01:14:16,951
I'm not fat!

1435
01:14:37,006 --> 01:14:39,907
I told you this wasn't over.

1436
01:14:57,727 --> 01:14:59,126
Sludge!

1437
01:15:04,067 --> 01:15:07,702
I have you now!

1438
01:15:11,107 --> 01:15:13,641
Ha! Is that the best
you can do?

1439
01:15:22,785 --> 01:15:24,118
Oh, crap!

1440
01:15:26,990 --> 01:15:29,190
Ohhh!

1441
01:15:42,105 --> 01:15:44,805
Hey, Big Guy? I'm sorry
about the whole gold thing.

1442
01:15:44,807 --> 01:15:45,907
But if you're
looking out for me,

1443
01:15:45,909 --> 01:15:47,909
now would be
a good time to help.

1444
01:15:49,178 --> 01:15:51,812
Well, I guess I'll look
on the bright side.

1445
01:15:51,814 --> 01:15:54,115
We'll get to spend
an eternity together, huh?

1446
01:15:54,117 --> 01:15:56,250
We'll get to hang out,
watch movies,

1447
01:15:56,252 --> 01:15:58,886
tell some jokes,
play some Monopoly.

1448
01:15:58,888 --> 01:16:01,989
You'll be my new best friend!

1449
01:16:01,991 --> 01:16:03,190
Oh, no!

1450
01:16:11,167 --> 01:16:13,701
Oh, God, if there's any chance
I'm going to Heaven,

1451
01:16:13,703 --> 01:16:15,136
please give me a sign!

1452
01:16:16,973 --> 01:16:18,606
How ya doin'?

1453
01:16:37,327 --> 01:16:38,593
Wow...

1454
01:16:39,662 --> 01:16:41,796
You actually did it.

1455
01:16:43,232 --> 01:16:44,799
And this time machine
actually works.

1456
01:16:44,801 --> 01:16:46,300
I gotta tell Herbert!

1457
01:16:47,904 --> 01:16:49,604
Wait. Wait.

1458
01:16:49,606 --> 01:16:51,372
Where and when am I?

1459
01:16:51,374 --> 01:16:52,873
Oh, that's right.

1460
01:16:52,875 --> 01:16:54,375
Will set the clock to the date
of my first mission,

1461
01:16:54,377 --> 01:16:56,243
which means I still
have time to go back

1462
01:16:56,245 --> 01:16:58,613
and stop
the Dark Winged Vesper.

1463
01:16:58,615 --> 01:17:01,082
To the Main Street Bridge!

1464
01:17:01,084 --> 01:17:03,184
And warp speed ahead.

1465
01:17:03,186 --> 01:17:05,886
Oh, wait. That's me.

1466
01:17:22,271 --> 01:17:25,139
So your past self must never
see you future self,

1467
01:17:25,141 --> 01:17:28,175
or one of the two of you
will combust.

1468
01:17:28,177 --> 01:17:29,644
Thank you.

1469
01:17:30,713 --> 01:17:32,346
I'll remember that.

1470
01:17:37,286 --> 01:17:39,253
<i>A true superhero,</i>

1471
01:17:39,255 --> 01:17:41,322
<i>ready to take on the world.</i>

1472
01:17:43,192 --> 01:17:44,792
Aw, crap.

1473
01:18:00,143 --> 01:18:01,676
Pop the trunk.

1474
01:18:12,822 --> 01:18:15,189
Look at those
dysfunctional losers.

1475
01:18:16,225 --> 01:18:17,925
Ed's gonna thank me
for taking him away

1476
01:18:17,927 --> 01:18:19,393
from those rejects.

1477
01:18:19,395 --> 01:18:21,228
Sure I will, Dad.

1478
01:18:21,230 --> 01:18:23,064
Join the family business, son.

1479
01:18:23,066 --> 01:18:24,165
Become a superhero.

1480
01:18:24,167 --> 01:18:26,233
Have a few laughs.
Steal some gold.

1481
01:18:26,235 --> 01:18:29,136
I'm gonna have to kill you now.
It's nothing personal.

1482
01:18:29,138 --> 01:18:30,771
Just business.

1483
01:18:32,008 --> 01:18:33,474
What was that?

1484
01:18:33,476 --> 01:18:34,875
<i>I gotta tell the others</i>

1485
01:18:34,877 --> 01:18:36,637
<i>if I'm gonna make things right.</i>

1486
01:19:01,471 --> 01:19:04,371
Something's there.

1487
01:19:04,373 --> 01:19:06,307
Close the trunk.

1488
01:19:06,309 --> 01:19:07,742
Check it out.

1489
01:19:11,814 --> 01:19:13,097
Go!

1490
01:19:13,098 --> 01:19:14,381
<i>If I stay low,</i>
<i>I might be able toget</i>

1491
01:19:14,383 --> 01:19:15,783
<i>the Super Capers' attention</i>

1492
01:19:15,785 --> 01:19:17,545
<i>without the old Ed noticing me.</i>

1493
01:19:52,922 --> 01:19:54,321
So... So beat this evil brute!

1494
01:19:54,323 --> 01:19:55,790
For this republic
for which you stand.

1495
01:19:55,792 --> 01:19:57,312
So help me, I do. Shalom!

1496
01:19:59,295 --> 01:20:00,795
Ooh..

1497
01:20:00,797 --> 01:20:02,096
I can fix that.

1498
01:20:09,272 --> 01:20:11,272
Ed! You did it, buddy!

1499
01:20:11,274 --> 01:20:13,874
I did.

1500
01:20:13,876 --> 01:20:16,076
I-I mean, I did!

1501
01:20:16,078 --> 01:20:17,238
<i>But how?</i>

1502
01:20:21,384 --> 01:20:23,184
Okay, I think I'm screwed.

1503
01:20:28,991 --> 01:20:31,258
Oh, shoot! The keys!

1504
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:32,359
Okay.

1505
01:20:40,303 --> 01:20:42,036
<i>Well, that can't be good.</i>

1506
01:20:55,351 --> 01:20:57,284
This isn't over!

1507
01:20:57,286 --> 01:21:00,254
We will be back, Mr. Gruberman!

1508
01:21:04,293 --> 01:21:05,943
Nice work, Gruberman.

1509
01:21:05,944 --> 01:21:07,594
Just remember,
I'll always be number one.

1510
01:21:07,597 --> 01:21:08,863
Ed?

1511
01:21:13,536 --> 01:21:14,969
Will!

1512
01:21:14,971 --> 01:21:16,203
Will, stop that van!

1513
01:21:16,205 --> 01:21:19,073
Ed? Well, if you're Ed,
then who are you?

1514
01:21:19,075 --> 01:21:21,108
Will, now!

1515
01:21:21,110 --> 01:21:23,510
Your superpowers are amazing.

1516
01:21:34,490 --> 01:21:36,390
Good job, Will!

1517
01:21:36,392 --> 01:21:38,592
Uh, I mean team.

1518
01:21:42,498 --> 01:21:44,365
Who are you? I'm you.

1519
01:21:46,235 --> 01:21:49,470
Then who am I? You're me.

1520
01:21:49,472 --> 01:21:52,640
Well done, everyone!
Well done, Gruberman!

1521
01:21:53,609 --> 01:21:55,442
Grubermen...

1522
01:21:55,444 --> 01:21:58,045
No. No, no. This is impossible.

1523
01:21:58,047 --> 01:21:59,047
Felicia, stop him!

1524
01:21:59,048 --> 01:22:01,081
Freeze!

1525
01:22:01,083 --> 01:22:03,350
I'm from the future.

1526
01:22:03,352 --> 01:22:06,420
I got the time machine to work, and I
found out the judge is a criminal.

1527
01:22:06,422 --> 01:22:08,923
The RV worked? No way!

1528
01:22:08,925 --> 01:22:11,592
Don't let him fool you. He's been
an organized crime boss for years.

1529
01:22:11,594 --> 01:22:13,494
You'll find he has
in his possession

1530
01:22:13,495 --> 01:22:15,395
some of the gold bars
taken from the armored car.

1531
01:22:15,398 --> 01:22:18,599
He's lying!
I demand to be let go!

1532
01:22:20,002 --> 01:22:21,468
Forget it, Judge.

1533
01:22:21,470 --> 01:22:23,437
We caught you
with your pants down.

1534
01:22:23,439 --> 01:22:25,506
Herman, will you do the honors?

1535
01:22:25,508 --> 01:22:27,574
It would be my pleasure.

1536
01:22:27,576 --> 01:22:29,076
I'm sure it would be.

1537
01:22:34,183 --> 01:22:36,283
Herman, I was talking
about the limo trunk.

1538
01:22:36,285 --> 01:22:38,152
Sorry.

1539
01:22:42,425 --> 01:22:45,993
The Dark-Winged Vesper,
my hero, a criminal?

1540
01:22:45,995 --> 01:22:48,662
Yes. The judge...

1541
01:22:48,664 --> 01:22:51,532
is the Dark Winged Vesper.

1542
01:22:51,534 --> 01:22:55,135
We were framed.
The judge put us up to it.

1543
01:22:55,137 --> 01:22:57,071
Please let us go.

1544
01:22:57,073 --> 01:22:59,540
I think I may have
had an accident.

1545
01:23:00,676 --> 01:23:03,510
Oh! Well, now I bet
the name Captain Fudge

1546
01:23:03,512 --> 01:23:05,312
sounds pretty funny.

1547
01:23:05,314 --> 01:23:07,748
Son, how could you
do this to me

1548
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:10,184
after all that I've given you?

1549
01:23:10,186 --> 01:23:11,618
And, yes, he's also my father.

1550
01:23:13,456 --> 01:23:15,189
My father? Relax, Ed.

1551
01:23:15,191 --> 01:23:17,524
It's not like I told you
he murdered our parents yet.

1552
01:23:18,761 --> 01:23:20,427
Wha...?

1553
01:23:22,498 --> 01:23:24,799
Oops.

1554
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:27,101
Ed, you're just
kidding yourself here.

1555
01:23:27,103 --> 01:23:29,536
You and your dysfunctional
idiot friends

1556
01:23:29,538 --> 01:23:31,472
will never be as great
a superhero as me.

1557
01:23:31,474 --> 01:23:34,208
And you know that.
I'm sorry, Dad.

1558
01:23:34,210 --> 01:23:36,543
I may never be the great
hero you once were,

1559
01:23:36,545 --> 01:23:38,329
but at least I'm honest.

1560
01:23:38,330 --> 01:23:40,114
And as for my dysfunctional
superhero friends,

1561
01:23:40,116 --> 01:23:41,315
they're my family now.

1562
01:23:41,317 --> 01:23:43,117
Whoa. Who's dysfunctional?

1563
01:23:43,119 --> 01:23:46,720
Call me crazy, but I think
I'm falling for this future Ed.

1564
01:23:46,722 --> 01:23:49,156
Ah, I'm gonna be sick.

1565
01:23:49,158 --> 01:23:51,258
Uh, but...

1566
01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:53,761
we were here the whole time.

1567
01:23:53,763 --> 01:23:57,631
How did the judge
sneak away with the gold?

1568
01:23:57,633 --> 01:23:59,500
Yeah.

1569
01:23:59,502 --> 01:24:02,169
He had an accomplice.

1570
01:24:02,171 --> 01:24:04,638
Not only could she create fire,

1571
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:07,374
but she could vanish at will,
ladies and gentlemen.

1572
01:24:07,376 --> 01:24:10,577
My lady in red,
please take a bow!

1573
01:24:14,150 --> 01:24:16,817
How'd you figure out
that one, Gruberman?

1574
01:24:16,819 --> 01:24:18,786
Well, how else
would you explain

1575
01:24:18,787 --> 01:24:20,754
the disappearing in the alley,
the easy removal of the gold,

1576
01:24:20,756 --> 01:24:22,656
and the wacky
controls on the RV,

1577
01:24:22,658 --> 01:24:25,692
sending it crashing
off the side of the bridge?

1578
01:24:25,694 --> 01:24:27,661
I knew you'd wreck the RV.

1579
01:24:27,663 --> 01:24:30,631
Well, actually, it vanished
before it hit bottom.

1580
01:24:30,633 --> 01:24:32,299
And, hey,
we still got this one.

1581
01:24:32,301 --> 01:24:34,234
No matter.

1582
01:24:34,236 --> 01:24:37,156
This bridge will be ash rubble
by the time I'm done with it.

1583
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:40,174
What do you say, Ed?
You and me?

1584
01:24:41,143 --> 01:24:43,377
Run away together?
Live a life of crime?

1585
01:24:43,379 --> 01:24:45,112
He's mine!

1586
01:24:47,616 --> 01:24:49,650
Ed, the judge!

1587
01:24:55,791 --> 01:24:57,624
He must have jumped.

1588
01:24:57,626 --> 01:24:59,460
Do you think he made it?
No way.

1589
01:25:16,812 --> 01:25:18,612
I'm sorry, Ed.

1590
01:25:18,614 --> 01:25:20,514
That's okay. Hey!

1591
01:25:20,516 --> 01:25:21,715
Ed, the old you's waking up.

1592
01:25:21,717 --> 01:25:23,817
I-I'd better go talk to him.

1593
01:25:28,491 --> 01:25:31,225
Hey. You okay?

1594
01:25:31,227 --> 01:25:33,527
I thought it was a dream,
but it's true.

1595
01:25:33,529 --> 01:25:36,430
I'm afraid so.
There's two of us now.

1596
01:25:36,432 --> 01:25:39,466
What about
the Dark-Winged Vesper...

1597
01:25:39,468 --> 01:25:40,801
our father?

1598
01:25:41,737 --> 01:25:43,904
That's all over. He's, uh...

1599
01:25:43,906 --> 01:25:45,539
He's taken care of.

1600
01:25:45,541 --> 01:25:48,775
I have to say,
I like your suit.

1601
01:25:48,777 --> 01:25:50,477
Thanks.

1602
01:25:50,479 --> 01:25:51,712
You know, I always heard that

1603
01:25:51,714 --> 01:25:53,780
if the same person
saw his future self,

1604
01:25:53,782 --> 01:25:55,616
there'd be a paradox
in the universe,

1605
01:25:55,618 --> 01:25:58,185
and one of the two
would combust.

1606
01:25:58,187 --> 01:25:59,303
What a coincidence.

1607
01:25:59,304 --> 01:26:00,420
You know, I heard
the same thing.

1608
01:26:00,422 --> 01:26:01,688
Just goes to show you,
you can't believe

1609
01:26:01,690 --> 01:26:03,157
everything you hear
in the movies.

1610
01:26:03,159 --> 01:26:05,259
Here.

1611
01:26:07,630 --> 01:26:10,297
Well, let's give him a moment.

1612
01:26:11,867 --> 01:26:15,369
Uh, hey, guys! Wait up!
The old Ed's gone!

1613
01:26:15,371 --> 01:26:18,305
Throw him over the bridge?
Couldn't stand the competition?

1614
01:26:18,307 --> 01:26:20,474
No, actually, I think
God fixed everything.

1615
01:26:20,476 --> 01:26:22,676
Good. It was too confusing.

1616
01:26:22,678 --> 01:26:24,611
Hey, do you think next time,
I could just stay home

1617
01:26:24,613 --> 01:26:25,779
and watch this on the news?

1618
01:26:25,781 --> 01:26:26,780
It was just too stressful.

1619
01:26:26,782 --> 01:26:29,416
Get in the RV.

1620
01:26:29,418 --> 01:26:30,817
I'm surrounded by idiots.

1621
01:26:30,819 --> 01:26:32,653
So you're into me, huh?

1622
01:26:32,655 --> 01:26:35,489
I could definitely fall
for this future Ed.

1623
01:26:35,491 --> 01:26:37,575
Well, that's good,
'cause, you know,

1624
01:26:37,576 --> 01:26:39,660
I traveled forward in time
and I saw that we kissed.

1625
01:26:39,662 --> 01:26:41,395
No way. Yeah!

1626
01:26:41,397 --> 01:26:43,630
Would you deny the existence
for our future children?

1627
01:26:43,632 --> 01:26:46,266
Oh, ho ho. Children.
Yeah! We got two kids.

1628
01:26:46,268 --> 01:26:47,834
Really. What are their names?

1629
01:26:47,836 --> 01:26:50,470
Our kids? Yes!

1630
01:26:50,472 --> 01:26:53,907
Hansel and Gretel. Hansel
and Gretel Gruberman?

1631
01:26:53,909 --> 01:26:55,609
I don't think so. Oh, yeah!

1632
01:26:55,611 --> 01:26:59,546
We're a crime-fighting
dysfunctional superhero family.

1633
01:26:59,548 --> 01:27:01,381
It's great!

1634
01:27:01,383 --> 01:27:02,816
You're gonna love it.

1635
01:27:03,819 --> 01:27:04,885
Really.

1636
01:27:09,692 --> 01:27:11,625
So, Ed, ol' buddy, ol' pal.

1637
01:27:11,627 --> 01:27:13,860
How do we get this thing
past 88 miles per hour?

1638
01:27:13,862 --> 01:27:15,329
Oh, that's the easy part.

1639
01:27:15,330 --> 01:27:16,797
Just drive this RV
right off the bridge,

1640
01:27:16,799 --> 01:27:18,632
and it pegs out before
you even hit bottom.

1641
01:27:18,634 --> 01:27:21,268
- Here, you want me to drive?
- I'll show ya... No!

1642
01:27:21,270 --> 01:27:24,905
This is the part where
you just have to have faith.

1643
01:27:24,907 --> 01:27:26,807
Super Capers...

1644
01:27:26,809 --> 01:27:28,942
- Let's rock!
- And roll!

1645
01:27:28,944 --> 01:27:31,812
Not "rock and roll."
Let's rock. God.

1646
01:27:31,814 --> 01:27:33,647
It's just "rock."
There's no "roll.

1647
01:27:33,649 --> 01:27:35,349
Brainard... Just go.

1648
01:27:35,351 --> 01:27:36,783
All right.

1649
01:27:38,787 --> 01:27:42,823
<i>¶ Look at what's</i>

1650
01:27:42,825 --> 01:27:47,361
<i>¶ I can't believe it myself ¶</i>

1651
01:27:47,363 --> 01:27:51,265

1652
01:27:51,267 --> 01:27:54,901

1667
01:29:07,643 --> 01:29:11,545

1668
01:29:12,715 --> 01:29:16,817

1669
01:29:16,819 --> 01:29:21,355

1677
01:30:01,964 --> 01:30:05,932

1679
01:30:08,070 --> 01:30:11,638
<i>¶ Believe it or not,</i>

1680
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:15,909
<i>¶ I never thought</i>
<i>I could feel so free ¶</i>

1681
01:30:15,911 --> 01:30:20,013
<i>¶ Flying away</i>
<i>on a wing and a prayer ¶</i>

1682
01:30:20,015 --> 01:30:24,050
<i>¶ Who could it be? ¶</i>

1683
01:30:24,052 --> 01:30:28,088
<i>¶ Believe it or not,</i>
<i>it's just me ¶</i>

1684
01:31:39,561 --> 01:31:41,061
Bunch of schmucks!

1685
01:31:41,063 --> 01:31:42,195
Hey, what do you
think you're doing?

1686
01:31:42,197 --> 01:31:43,964
Movie's not over yet!

1687
01:31:43,966 --> 01:31:46,032
Get back here!
Sit down, and watch this!

1688
01:31:46,034 --> 01:31:49,069
And don't forget to pick up
your popcorn when you leave!

1689
01:32:19,167 --> 01:32:22,135
What did you find, boss?

1690
01:32:22,137 --> 01:32:25,205
Looks like a tracking device

1691
01:32:25,207 --> 01:32:28,008
on a key chain to an RV.

1692
01:32:28,010 --> 01:32:31,578
So... what does that mean?

1693
01:32:38,086 --> 01:32:42,255
It means there really is a god.

1694
01:32:45,561 --> 01:32:49,930
I love this!

1695
01:32:49,932 --> 01:32:51,212
Well, then.

1696
01:32:53,969 --> 01:32:59,139
Perhaps we will get the
chance to use our powers.

1697
01:33:03,145 --> 01:33:05,011
Yeah.

1698
