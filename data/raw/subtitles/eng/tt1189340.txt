1
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,450
All right, Earl.

2
00:02:47,013 --> 00:02:48,522
Next, come on, step right through.

3
00:02:53,815 --> 00:02:54,819
-Looking good, Mick!
-Hey Lou.

4
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,296
Mick! Mick, I just called you...

5
00:02:57,674 --> 00:02:59,181
Hey, I just called you at the office.

6
00:02:59,182 --> 00:03:00,163
I... I gotta talk to you.

7
00:03:00,164 --> 00:03:02,635
-Come on, stick with me.
-How long you gonna be in today?

8
00:03:02,927 --> 00:03:04,758
Depends on the judge, calls my client.

9
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:07,928
See, what does this say about me that
I let you treat me like this, huh?

10
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:11,047
I'm giving you a big cashing whoop in
the world... help me man.

11
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:12,533
-My daughter's about to go to surgery.
-I've heard it all before, Val.

12
00:03:12,534 --> 00:03:14,301
-You understand?
-Come on. Talk to me. What do you got?

13
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:15,049
Okay, I got something big for you.

14
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,382
This guy's gonna be the big money
to Inglewood.

15
00:03:17,455 --> 00:03:19,549
But the problem is, if he goes up
before the judges,

16
00:03:19,606 --> 00:03:21,809
-at noon, okay? You listening to me?
-I'm listening.

17
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,246
So, the client, his mother...
his mother who comes

18
00:03:24,247 --> 00:03:25,553
to the office at 8 a.m in
the morning...

19
00:03:25,563 --> 00:03:27,281
-and...
-Has he already got a lawyer?

20
00:03:27,802 --> 00:03:28,431
Just listen.

21
00:03:28,432 --> 00:03:31,240
Listen, it's not criminal.
It's just real estate, okay?

22
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:32,692
And I made them so crazy about you...

23
00:03:33,065 --> 00:03:35,438
that they now wanna put up their
Malibu beach house against a million.

24
00:03:35,888 --> 00:03:37,191
-The bail's a million?
-Yeah, yeah...

25
00:03:37,285 --> 00:03:39,790
-What did they book this guy for?
-Well, I'd say it's romantic.

26
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:41,565
The cops are saying
he beat up the girl really bad,

27
00:03:41,566 --> 00:03:42,850
they wanna sell assault with
a deadly weapon...

28
00:03:42,851 --> 00:03:44,981
-throw in it the GPI's...
-The D.A filed yet?

29
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:45,719
Is he dead?

30
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:48,309
See, I take care of my friends.
I even take care of you, bubba.

31
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:49,558
Inglewood by noon.

32
00:03:49,559 --> 00:03:51,392
You could do it, man.
Go through some red lights...

33
00:03:51,393 --> 00:03:53,319
-Break the speed limits.
-How did it comes down? Is this real?

34
00:03:53,703 --> 00:03:56,100
-Don't bullshit me, is this real?
-Of course it is, would I lie to you?

35
00:03:56,466 --> 00:03:57,458
You're gonna take care of me, right?

36
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,786
Make them forget the beach house
and go for my bond?

37
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:02,195
What's the name?

38
00:04:02,771 --> 00:04:04,388
Louis. Louis Roulet.

39
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,550
R O U L E T. Like the wheel.

40
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:09,572
Alright, spare the wheel,
but, you got it.

41
00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:15,460
Roberto.

42
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:21,347
You mind checking that list? See if
our man uh... Harold Casey is on it?

43
00:04:24,601 --> 00:04:27,100
Oh, don't go that low... I got a
case across town at noon.

44
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:27,960
I gotta get to.

45
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,325
You mind just bringing him down?
It'll only be a sec.

46
00:04:31,102 --> 00:04:32,430
-Reynaldo.
-Pardon me?

47
00:04:34,054 --> 00:04:36,404
My name's Reynaldo, not Roberto.

48
00:04:37,283 --> 00:04:38,999
Us bailiffs all look alike, right?

49
00:04:39,367 --> 00:04:41,555
-Your man white?
-Yeah, he's white.

50
00:04:41,635 --> 00:04:43,591
I got blacks down here right now.

51
00:04:43,677 --> 00:04:44,666
Alright, listen.

52
00:04:44,845 --> 00:04:45,834
Reynaldo.

53
00:04:45,888 --> 00:04:48,800
My bad on your name. I do a lot of
askin', I guess I was wrong.

54
00:04:48,973 --> 00:04:51,009
But I didn't forget you at Christmas
time, did I?

55
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,408
Remember that giant
nut with the prizes

56
00:04:53,409 --> 00:04:55,890
signed Happy holidays,
your friend, Nick?

57
00:04:56,104 --> 00:04:57,253
I went through those pretty fast.

58
00:04:58,272 --> 00:04:59,387
Alright, let's make it two this time.

59
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:01,191
Okay.

60
00:05:01,273 --> 00:05:02,590
I'll bring your buddy down,
but you'd better make it quick.

61
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,862
<i>Gracias</i>, Reynaldo.

62
00:05:04,609 --> 00:05:05,644
Harold Casey.

63
00:05:05,693 --> 00:05:06,682
Yeah, bring him down.

64
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:10,380
Harold!

65
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,832
You shouldn't be running from
your lawyer. That's bad form.

66
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,939
You know what I wanna talk about?

67
00:05:15,034 --> 00:05:16,796
In a minute,
Judge Powell's gonna call us down.

68
00:05:16,797 --> 00:05:18,893
He's gonna wanna know
if we're ready for trial.

69
00:05:19,161 --> 00:05:20,230
-We are?
-We are not.

70
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:21,315
And you know why not.

71
00:05:21,325 --> 00:05:23,085
Rule one, I get paid.

72
00:05:23,086 --> 00:05:23,893
Or I don't work.

73
00:05:23,894 --> 00:05:25,982
Alright! Don't worry,
I got your money.

74
00:05:25,984 --> 00:05:27,470
Exactly, you got it.

75
00:05:27,586 --> 00:05:30,347
-I don't.
-It's coming, I talked to my boys.

76
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,981
Listen, Harold, I look down the list
of people I trust.

77
00:05:33,574 --> 00:05:34,709
You're not on it.

78
00:05:34,798 --> 00:05:36,239
The law says you can't just quit.

79
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,618
The judge won't let you.

80
00:05:37,658 --> 00:05:38,623
I looked it up.

81
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:41,578
Pay close attention.

82
00:05:43,588 --> 00:05:45,499
Michael Haller for the defense,
your honour.

83
00:05:45,589 --> 00:05:46,783
If I may, I'd like to carry this over.

84
00:05:46,881 --> 00:05:48,792
You have a reason, Mr. Haller?

85
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:50,952
Having trouble locating a witness,
your honour.

86
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:53,042
An indispensable witness, a Mr. Green?

87
00:05:54,136 --> 00:05:55,967
How much time do you need?

88
00:05:56,139 --> 00:05:57,174
That's hard to say.

89
00:05:58,139 --> 00:05:59,208
Does the state object?

90
00:05:59,307 --> 00:06:00,296
No, your honour.

91
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,426
Alright, we'll hold this over.
Pending notification from counsel.

92
00:06:06,802 --> 00:06:08,179
That was some bullshit, man.

93
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:08,717
Oh yeah.

94
00:06:09,232 --> 00:06:11,055
I expect to hear from you, Harold.

95
00:06:21,031 --> 00:06:24,023
Inglewood, Earl.
Keep it on the suburb streets.

96
00:06:41,004 --> 00:06:42,039
Earl, headphones.

97
00:06:44,048 --> 00:06:45,037
This is Haller.

98
00:06:45,092 --> 00:06:46,651
And this is your office.

99
00:06:46,652 --> 00:06:49,257
Uh... actually, I'm in my office,
Ms. Lorna.

100
00:06:49,258 --> 00:06:51,100
I'm on my way to
courthouse in Inglewood.

101
00:06:51,303 --> 00:06:53,419
Listen, jot down and remind me to
give Reynaldo...

102
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:56,471
the bailiff over at San Fernando,
$200 for Christmas, alright?

103
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,632
Got it. Hey, did Val reach you about
his customer?

104
00:06:59,767 --> 00:07:01,758
Yeah, 'I got something big
for you, Mick!'

105
00:07:01,853 --> 00:07:03,809
Everytime. Any other calls?

106
00:07:03,937 --> 00:07:05,848
No, just some odds and ends.

107
00:07:05,981 --> 00:07:07,993
PDUI's, they just recruited some
house members.

108
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:10,061
Oh... Gloria Larson called from
county lock-up.

109
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,185
She got popped again?

110
00:07:11,235 --> 00:07:13,146
<i>The usual with the complications.</i>

111
00:07:13,236 --> 00:07:15,987
<i>Cocaine possession. Her first
appearance is right after lunch.</i>

112
00:07:15,988 --> 00:07:17,665
Tell her, I'll try.

113
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:24,144
So, I was thinking, boss,
you know, uh...

114
00:07:24,145 --> 00:07:26,279
when you get your licence back,
why not maybe uh...

115
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,308
you know, I could stay-on.

116
00:07:28,872 --> 00:07:30,814
Like permanent things on me,
you know?

117
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:33,347
I got my licence back
3 months ago, Earl.

118
00:07:43,518 --> 00:07:46,333
Hey, boss. Want me to do
something about that?

119
00:07:46,343 --> 00:07:47,281
'Cos I can.

120
00:07:47,906 --> 00:07:49,086
Uh... keep doing what you're doing.

121
00:08:01,145 --> 00:08:02,134
Boss?

122
00:08:03,966 --> 00:08:04,635
Alright.

123
00:08:04,645 --> 00:08:06,079
Pull over up there.

124
00:08:24,162 --> 00:08:24,984
Councilor.

125
00:08:24,986 --> 00:08:26,740
-Eddie.
-How's it hangin'?

126
00:08:27,211 --> 00:08:29,273
Oh, a little to the left, my man.
How about you?

127
00:08:30,011 --> 00:08:30,838
Not bad.

128
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:32,574
Your ride's a little messy.

129
00:08:32,628 --> 00:08:35,506
Yeah, maid didn't come 'til tuesday.

130
00:08:35,629 --> 00:08:37,540
What can I do for you, big man?

131
00:08:37,672 --> 00:08:40,740
Our boy, Harold called from the pens,
said you're stalling his case

132
00:08:40,741 --> 00:08:41,745
'til you see some more 'green'.

133
00:08:41,927 --> 00:08:43,804
I don't get paid, I don't work.

134
00:08:43,886 --> 00:08:45,080
We paid you, $5,000.

135
00:08:45,138 --> 00:08:47,049
That's long gone, Eddie.

136
00:08:47,139 --> 00:08:50,973
Look, I could tell you, the half of it
went to an aerial photo expert.

137
00:08:51,142 --> 00:08:53,309
He's gonna blow the
state's case by showing

138
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,181
that the DEA violated the airspace...

139
00:08:55,394 --> 00:08:57,350
over Harold's farm by flying too low.

140
00:08:57,562 --> 00:09:00,520
I can also tell you that I gotta fly
that guy in from New York city...

141
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:03,641
get him to testify, put him up in
a hotel, and all that kind of stuff.

142
00:09:03,818 --> 00:09:04,853
But you don't need to know that.

143
00:09:05,777 --> 00:09:07,893
All you need to know is that
we had a deal.

144
00:09:08,862 --> 00:09:10,853
It's time to refill the tank.

145
00:09:10,948 --> 00:09:12,984
What? Another 5 grand?

146
00:09:13,115 --> 00:09:16,027
Ten. He wants to fly business.

147
00:09:16,202 --> 00:09:17,271
He wants first class hotel.

148
00:09:17,368 --> 00:09:19,324
And we want Harold back on the farm.

149
00:09:19,413 --> 00:09:21,715
He's our best farmer,
if you know what I mean?

150
00:09:21,716 --> 00:09:22,291
I don't.

151
00:09:22,413 --> 00:09:23,482
And I don't want to.

152
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:25,026
Now, look.

153
00:09:25,577 --> 00:09:26,581
Either pay me.

154
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,324
Or go with the public defender.

155
00:09:29,154 --> 00:09:30,978
He won't know much about
air space, but...

156
00:09:40,178 --> 00:09:41,293
aren't you gonna count it?

157
00:09:41,386 --> 00:09:42,421
I just did.

158
00:09:44,304 --> 00:09:45,373
Keep that rubber on the road, Eddie.

159
00:09:47,434 --> 00:09:48,469
Let's roll, Earl.

160
00:09:52,687 --> 00:09:54,623
So, this expert flying
in from New York,

161
00:09:54,624 --> 00:09:55,856
you want me to pick him
up at the airport?

162
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,343
There's nobody coming in.

163
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:01,944
The best camera experts in the world
are right here in Hollywood.

164
00:10:04,361 --> 00:10:06,885
Nice, you know what?

165
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:09,785
You would've done alright
on the streets.

166
00:10:09,795 --> 00:10:13,059
Shit... what do you think I am,
Earl?

167
00:10:36,501 --> 00:10:37,306
Louis Roulet?

168
00:10:38,077 --> 00:10:39,066
Yes.

169
00:10:41,121 --> 00:10:42,190
I'm Michael Haller.

170
00:10:42,246 --> 00:10:45,137
Mr. Haller. I called you because
I need someone.

171
00:10:45,138 --> 00:10:46,682
This whole thing is a set-up.

172
00:10:46,816 --> 00:10:49,075
I made a mistake with that woman
and she was setting me up...

173
00:10:49,076 --> 00:10:50,537
Keep your voice down, hear me?

174
00:10:51,102 --> 00:10:54,139
Don't say anything about the case,
until I get you out on bail.

175
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,198
I understand your family lawyer's
in court?

176
00:10:58,318 --> 00:11:00,309
Yes, his name's Cecil Dobbs.

177
00:11:00,612 --> 00:11:03,410
-He's here somewhere.
-I'll find him.

178
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:04,639
Tell me about yourself.

179
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:07,609
-How old are you?
-32.

180
00:11:07,866 --> 00:11:09,857
Ties to the community?
Did you grow up here?

181
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,985
Yeah, Beverly Hills. Went to USC.

182
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,997
I worked for my mother's business.

183
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,149
What about your father?

184
00:11:16,248 --> 00:11:18,000
He died when I was 2.

185
00:11:19,606 --> 00:11:21,365
How much did you make last year, Louis?

186
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:23,414
My taxes said $600,000.

187
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:25,488
I want a lawyer too.

188
00:11:25,545 --> 00:11:27,501
My name's Corliss two S's.

189
00:11:27,863 --> 00:11:29,260
-You got a card on you?
-Listen, buddy, they have

190
00:11:29,261 --> 00:11:30,623
a lawyer for you out there.

191
00:11:31,306 --> 00:11:33,866
Right now, I need you to back away
and give us a little space.

192
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,005
Can you do that, pal?

193
00:11:39,138 --> 00:11:40,969
I'm backing, boss.

194
00:11:41,056 --> 00:11:42,171
-Here we go.
-Okay.

195
00:11:43,268 --> 00:11:44,257
There we go.

196
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:45,344
There we go.

197
00:11:46,352 --> 00:11:47,387
Now, listen, they've uh...

198
00:11:48,103 --> 00:11:49,897
put some heavy charges on you, Louis.

199
00:11:49,898 --> 00:11:51,962
The D.A's probably gonna ask
for no bail.

200
00:11:51,963 --> 00:11:54,644
-No bail?
-I said they're gonna ask for it.

201
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,168
When was the last time you
were arrested?

202
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,349
-Never.
-So, if I check your, your record....

203
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,709
You'd find parking tickets.

204
00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:03,718
Are you gonna get me out of here?

205
00:12:03,774 --> 00:12:05,651
I'm gonna try, Louis.

206
00:12:13,155 --> 00:12:16,147
Are you the prosecutor who used
to have the Roulet's case?

207
00:12:17,451 --> 00:12:18,440
Haller.

208
00:12:20,411 --> 00:12:21,400
Son of a bitch.

209
00:12:21,454 --> 00:12:22,489
Rules are rules.

210
00:12:22,538 --> 00:12:26,417
I wanted this one.
Okay, okay, I'll go quletly.

211
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,816
But after today's hearing,
if you don't object...

212
00:12:29,918 --> 00:12:30,953
Depends.

213
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,909
You going for no bail?

214
00:12:33,004 --> 00:12:35,882
That won't change with the prosecutor.

215
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:38,037
Not after what your guy did.

216
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:39,168
If he didn't?

217
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:40,286
Sure 'if'.

218
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:44,255
Bailey picked him in her home
with blood all over him.

219
00:12:44,428 --> 00:12:46,339
I love it when you get sarcastic.

220
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:49,516
Can I at least see the arrest report?

221
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,591
Fine! You get it from whomever
takes over.

222
00:12:52,684 --> 00:12:53,753
No favours on this one.

223
00:12:55,978 --> 00:12:57,855
How's Hayley today?

224
00:12:59,981 --> 00:13:01,016
She's good.

225
00:13:01,065 --> 00:13:02,054
Good.

226
00:13:03,192 --> 00:13:05,183
I'll pick her up the usual time
on saturday.

227
00:13:06,321 --> 00:13:08,198
Because of the seriousness of the
offence...

228
00:13:08,323 --> 00:13:10,393
the financial resources of
the accused...

229
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,201
the state requests no bail.

230
00:13:12,211 --> 00:13:14,008
Your honour, there's no way
the state can

231
00:13:14,009 --> 00:13:15,491
claim that my client is a flight risk.

232
00:13:15,702 --> 00:13:18,461
-He's not.
-With resources like this man has,

233
00:13:18,462 --> 00:13:19,661
flight is always a risk.

234
00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:21,362
-Are there any priors?
-No, your honour.

235
00:13:21,372 --> 00:13:23,525
Then, I'm gonna reduce
the risk of flight

236
00:13:23,526 --> 00:13:25,731
by ordering him to wear
a tracer anklet...

237
00:13:25,741 --> 00:13:28,079
and I'm gonna set bail at $1 million.

238
00:13:28,211 --> 00:13:31,283
-Judge, have you seen the photo?
-Ms. Mcpherson, bail is set.

239
00:13:31,463 --> 00:13:32,452
Thank you, judge.

240
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:38,423
Mick, feel compel to thank me
and speak good of me

241
00:13:38,424 --> 00:13:39,719
'cos this one's gonna be the
money, I'm telling you.

242
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,614
We'll see, we'll see.

243
00:13:40,615 --> 00:13:43,689
Alright! This is the lawyer
right there, Cecil Dobbs.

244
00:13:43,761 --> 00:13:44,844
Hey, Mick, don't forget our deal.

245
00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:47,177
Possibilty but...

246
00:13:47,434 --> 00:13:49,048
Oh... he's here now.
I'll talk to you later.

247
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,982
-Cecil Dobbs.
-Mr. Haller.

248
00:13:54,188 --> 00:13:57,077
Depressing to see the boy caught
up in that cattle call.

249
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:58,035
The boy?

250
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,852
I represented the family for a long time.

251
00:14:02,307 --> 00:14:05,135
Listen, my advice is, let Val fix you
up the bond.

252
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:06,981
And you, take the boy home.

253
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,118
Well, we were thinking of putting
up property.

254
00:14:09,384 --> 00:14:10,634
There's the Windsors beach house.

255
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,932
Mother's name is Windsor?

256
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,525
Her second husband's name.

257
00:14:13,775 --> 00:14:14,514
He's dead now.

258
00:14:14,638 --> 00:14:16,276
Assessing the house could take days.

259
00:14:16,432 --> 00:14:19,044
And trust me, you don't want the boy
in the clean cringing that long.

260
00:14:19,207 --> 00:14:22,244
So, tap Val.
Take Louis to your office...

261
00:14:22,376 --> 00:14:23,411
I'll meet you there at 4.

262
00:14:23,585 --> 00:14:25,759
Here, let me give you
my business card.

263
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:29,577
Oh boy.

264
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:31,826
Oh... media?

265
00:14:32,806 --> 00:14:34,043
Yeah, that'll be on us.

266
00:14:35,227 --> 00:14:37,836
Mrs. Windsor's sensitive about
the press.

267
00:14:38,605 --> 00:14:40,210
<i>I guess there's not much we can
do about that.</i>

268
00:14:42,036 --> 00:14:42,656
<i>We'll see.</i>

269
00:14:43,748 --> 00:14:44,447
<i>Say, Bob!</i>

270
00:14:44,822 --> 00:14:46,129
Come here. Come here.

271
00:14:47,085 --> 00:14:48,367
Saw you filming in there.
What's your name?

272
00:14:48,368 --> 00:14:50,678
Name's Rob Gillan.
They call me 'Sticks'.

273
00:14:50,778 --> 00:14:52,368
Sticks, you freelancing on this?

274
00:14:52,469 --> 00:14:55,242
Yeah, your client's got profile,
figure I'll sell it to local news.

275
00:14:55,252 --> 00:14:56,881
-How much?
-How much what?

276
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,856
How much they pay you for
what you shot in there?

277
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,303
Uh... that depends.

278
00:15:00,304 --> 00:15:02,558
-7... 750?
-Ehh!

279
00:15:03,042 --> 00:15:04,737
How about we take it off your hands...

280
00:15:04,866 --> 00:15:07,170
for 8? No?

281
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:08,981
Too short?

282
00:15:09,077 --> 00:15:10,507
Alright, let's make it a grand.

283
00:15:10,594 --> 00:15:12,236
-Deal?
-That's yours.

284
00:15:12,604 --> 00:15:16,238
-So, I can expense this, right?
-Of course.

285
00:15:16,422 --> 00:15:17,411
Absolutely.

286
00:15:17,464 --> 00:15:18,801
Thank you, Sticks.

287
00:15:19,165 --> 00:15:20,419
Thank you.

288
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,945
You know, Mr. Haller...
you weren't my choice.

289
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,024
I bet I wasn't.

290
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:27,568
Firms like yours must have
some heavy hitters on call.

291
00:15:27,805 --> 00:15:29,858
We do, but Louis insisted.

292
00:15:30,908 --> 00:15:32,900
Frankly, I've never heard of you.

293
00:15:32,993 --> 00:15:35,030
But uh... maybe I should have.

294
00:15:36,205 --> 00:15:37,846
Did you say I was Louis' choice?

295
00:15:37,847 --> 00:15:40,328
Yes, he read about a case you had.

296
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:46,689
I need a hundred grand upfront.
Working on $550 an hour...

297
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,124
another hundred if we go to trial.

298
00:15:48,134 --> 00:15:49,720
More if we goes pass a week.

299
00:15:49,811 --> 00:15:51,674
Appeals, we start over.

300
00:15:55,678 --> 00:15:57,103
I take it that's not a problem?

301
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,523
-No.
-See you at 4.

302
00:16:14,262 --> 00:16:15,280
Where are we headed now?

303
00:16:16,338 --> 00:16:17,888
We gotta go meet Sticks at Jim's.

304
00:16:18,705 --> 00:16:20,163
-The same spot?
-Hm-hm.

305
00:16:20,164 --> 00:16:20,875
Alright.

306
00:16:34,673 --> 00:16:35,664
There he is.

307
00:16:36,803 --> 00:16:37,795
There we go.

308
00:16:37,847 --> 00:16:40,056
Eight for me, two for you.

309
00:16:40,057 --> 00:16:41,425
-Thank you, Sticks.
-Anytime.

310
00:16:41,426 --> 00:16:43,438
-Hm-hm...
-Hey, hey, my tape!

311
00:17:14,197 --> 00:17:15,465
You don't look good, girl.

312
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:16,857
Thanks.

313
00:17:18,641 --> 00:17:19,715
Something new?

314
00:17:20,908 --> 00:17:22,240
Booked on possession of coke?

315
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:23,302
Plus the usual.

316
00:17:23,712 --> 00:17:25,705
I know, it's dumb, it's...

317
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:28,791
A guy paid me with it and I had
it on me when I went to the next.

318
00:17:28,969 --> 00:17:30,848
And the next was a cop?

319
00:17:31,057 --> 00:17:32,046
Yeah.

320
00:17:33,704 --> 00:17:35,181
Look, can't you get me into
one of those...

321
00:17:35,232 --> 00:17:37,447
Rehab places that get you straight?

322
00:17:37,448 --> 00:17:41,345
We did a pre-trial rehab last time.
The DA's never gonna go for it again.

323
00:17:41,491 --> 00:17:43,728
You may have to do some
jail time, Gloria.

324
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:44,529
Micky, I can't!

325
00:17:44,539 --> 00:17:48,702
Yes, you can. Yes... you can.

326
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,352
Hey... they have programs in jail too.

327
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:54,889
Now look, you've had a long run.

328
00:17:56,054 --> 00:17:58,013
Maybe after this you'll get on
with your life.

329
00:18:00,186 --> 00:18:01,177
Yeah.

330
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:03,272
Housewife of the year. That's me.

331
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:07,077
Maybe I can turn some
tricks for the PTA.

332
00:18:08,845 --> 00:18:12,036
-It's not funny.
-I'd like to see that.

333
00:18:12,749 --> 00:18:14,661
Alright, alright, give it to me.

334
00:18:15,158 --> 00:18:16,883
Alright, I uh...

335
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:19,463
I did a guy at the Traveller's Lodge
at Santa Monica.

336
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:21,597
A guy who paid you with
coke instead of money?

337
00:18:21,598 --> 00:18:23,977
Yeah, and he had a shovel
of coke in there, I saw.

338
00:18:25,585 --> 00:18:27,617
-Do you know him?
-No.

339
00:18:27,618 --> 00:18:29,728
He reached me from my website.
He was uh...

340
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,764
No... he's Mexican or something.

341
00:18:33,097 --> 00:18:34,134
Did you screen him?

342
00:18:34,224 --> 00:18:35,295
Oh, I screened them all.

343
00:18:35,393 --> 00:18:37,307
Okay, with what? His driver's licence?

344
00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:39,311
His passport. It was uh...

345
00:18:39,443 --> 00:18:41,482
his name uh...

346
00:18:43,617 --> 00:18:45,609
-His name's Hector.
-Hector what?

347
00:18:45,744 --> 00:18:47,269
-Um...
-What's his last name?

348
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:48,730
Think, Gloria, think.

349
00:18:48,876 --> 00:18:52,417
Hector Arande Moya's...
what'd you get if you run a trace.

350
00:18:52,427 --> 00:18:55,046
He's a fugitive from a grand jury
down in Florida.

351
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:57,093
The DA wants him for drug trafficking.

352
00:18:57,222 --> 00:19:00,136
And Leslie, they want him a lot.

353
00:19:00,267 --> 00:19:02,226
And your girl's looking to trade?

354
00:19:02,355 --> 00:19:04,313
She gives you his hotel
and room number.

355
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,394
-She'll also testify on the coke?
-No, location only.

356
00:19:07,572 --> 00:19:08,688
You guys take it from there.

357
00:19:08,741 --> 00:19:11,701
My best guess is that Hector
hasn't checked out yet.

358
00:19:13,789 --> 00:19:14,861
And in exchange?

359
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:18,796
You drop all charges,
all she does is a pre-child rehab.

360
00:19:19,132 --> 00:19:21,168
The facility at the
USC med would be nice.

361
00:19:22,345 --> 00:19:24,222
Or I can take it to the feds.

362
00:19:24,347 --> 00:19:26,385
They'll cut this deal in a minute.

363
00:19:31,693 --> 00:19:33,526
Alright, you fucking asshole.

364
00:19:34,865 --> 00:19:35,857
After you.

365
00:19:37,826 --> 00:19:38,654
You'd go head first?

366
00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:40,820
I'd give it a shot if I was
gonna do it.

367
00:19:40,997 --> 00:19:43,037
-Why?
-Star points.

368
00:19:43,128 --> 00:19:46,042
You're so vain,
nobody cares if you kill yourself.

369
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:48,666
It'll look cool.
What do you think the last thing

370
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:50,134
that'd go through your mind
would be?

371
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,382
Your asshole.

372
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,472
Mr. Haller.

373
00:19:55,525 --> 00:19:56,719
Louis, good morning.

374
00:19:57,775 --> 00:19:59,770
-Thank you.
-It's just a start.

375
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,702
This is Frank Levin.
Frank's my investigator.

376
00:20:02,871 --> 00:20:04,827
-Louis Roulet.
-Good to meet you.

377
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:06,034
We're in here.

378
00:20:07,808 --> 00:20:10,204
Got a... tracer anklet.

379
00:20:10,296 --> 00:20:11,450
A present from your friend,

380
00:20:11,451 --> 00:20:13,291
Mr. Valenzuela by order of the court.

381
00:20:13,427 --> 00:20:16,343
As if I'd go any place
before this thing's over.

382
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:17,550
Gentlemen, welcome.

383
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:19,479
-Mr. Dobbs.
-Mr. Haller.

384
00:20:19,562 --> 00:20:20,678
Good to see you. This is Frank Levin.

385
00:20:20,731 --> 00:20:24,612
Mr. Levin is my investigator.
His fees are in addition to mine.

386
00:20:24,778 --> 00:20:25,848
Of course.

387
00:20:25,946 --> 00:20:28,862
Gentlemen, this is Mary Windsor.
She's Louis' mother.

388
00:20:29,035 --> 00:20:30,991
-Mr. Haller.
-Mrs. Windsor.

389
00:20:31,081 --> 00:20:32,670
-Pleasure to meet you.
-How do you do?

390
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,278
I'm fine, thank you.
This is Frank Levin, my investigator.

391
00:20:35,378 --> 00:20:37,177
How do you do?

392
00:20:39,627 --> 00:20:42,425
The charges against
my son are ridiculous.

393
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:43,678
So is that woman.

394
00:20:43,727 --> 00:20:46,525
Here's a cheque for you, Mr. Haller.

395
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:49,808
This is going to have to come
from your son, Mrs. Windsor.

396
00:20:49,905 --> 00:20:52,333
You can give him the money,
he can write the cheque.

397
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,022
But it must come from him.

398
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,998
He's my client.

399
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:57,236
And I have to be clear from the start.

400
00:21:02,505 --> 00:21:05,340
I can't thank you enough
for being here.

401
00:21:05,469 --> 00:21:08,431
Sincerely, it's good to know
that you're gonna be there.

402
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:09,716
When we need you.

403
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,769
But not now? Is that it?

404
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:15,930
No, ma'am. The DA can make you
testify about what you hear.

405
00:21:16,069 --> 00:21:18,948
Attorney priviledge does
not cover you.

406
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:24,163
I'll see you at home.

407
00:21:29,591 --> 00:21:31,585
She's not used to being
told what to do.

408
00:21:31,677 --> 00:21:33,556
I can believe that.

409
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,593
So, how fast can I go to trial?

410
00:21:35,724 --> 00:21:36,794
I want this behind me.

411
00:21:37,772 --> 00:21:38,762
Are you sure?

412
00:21:38,815 --> 00:21:40,808
You can stretch it out
and enjoy your freedom.

413
00:21:40,901 --> 00:21:43,017
-Most clients choose to...
-Guilty... clients, you mean.

414
00:21:45,239 --> 00:21:48,156
Okay, then I insist on
going to trial right away.

415
00:21:48,289 --> 00:21:51,167
Or perhaps,
it never goes to trial at all?

416
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:53,330
My firm can bring uh...

417
00:21:53,547 --> 00:21:54,754
considerable influence to bear.

418
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,704
Oh, don't kid yourself, Cecil.

419
00:21:56,761 --> 00:22:00,520
There's no way the state's
dropping these charges.

420
00:22:00,811 --> 00:22:02,768
As a matter of fact,
they've already upped them

421
00:22:02,769 --> 00:22:04,884
to pro-negotiating position.

422
00:22:05,064 --> 00:22:06,945
There won't be any negotiating.

423
00:22:07,027 --> 00:22:09,018
No plea bargain, no nothing.

424
00:22:09,155 --> 00:22:12,148
I'm not going to jail
for something I didn't do.

425
00:22:12,285 --> 00:22:13,320
I'm innocent.

426
00:22:13,412 --> 00:22:16,451
And if there is a trial, I wanna
take the stand and tell the jury...

427
00:22:16,584 --> 00:22:17,575
that I'm innocent.

428
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,618
Now, if that's a problem,
we can part company right now.

429
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,711
Time to tell me what happened.

430
00:22:26,893 --> 00:22:28,885
I was having a drink at
the Association.

431
00:22:28,977 --> 00:22:30,937
The Association?
It's the bar on 6th street...

432
00:22:31,203 --> 00:22:33,135
The one with a lot of young women?

433
00:22:33,235 --> 00:22:36,069
Right. Good for pick-ups.

434
00:22:36,198 --> 00:22:39,192
What's the file say
about the girl, Frank?

435
00:22:39,453 --> 00:22:42,096
Uh... Regina Campo.

436
00:22:42,097 --> 00:22:43,901
Known as Reggie, 26 years old.

437
00:22:43,902 --> 00:22:46,293
Part time actress,
part time office temp.

438
00:22:46,303 --> 00:22:48,991
And hoping to retire after
suing my client.

439
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:50,912
Did you know her before
last night, Louis?

440
00:22:51,013 --> 00:22:53,005
No. I've seen her around, but...

441
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,061
<i>We never spoke. She was
always with another guy.</i>

442
00:22:57,062 --> 00:22:58,099
<i>Last night too.</i>

443
00:22:59,276 --> 00:23:01,269
<i>I got it that she wasn't too
into her date.</i>

444
00:23:04,454 --> 00:23:08,370
<i>She brushed by me on
her way to the bathroom.</i>

445
00:23:10,794 --> 00:23:13,835
<i>And she basically just laid her
address on me, on a napkin.</i>

446
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:15,846
<i>She said she could get rid
of him by 10.</i>

447
00:23:15,928 --> 00:23:17,921
Do you still have it?
What she wrote down?

448
00:23:18,058 --> 00:23:19,971
<i>No, I didn't keep the napkin.</i>

449
00:23:20,061 --> 00:23:23,099
Check that file. See if the
police report has any of this.

450
00:23:23,233 --> 00:23:26,326
Frank here has already
worked us a little miracle.

451
00:23:26,603 --> 00:23:30,399
He uh... happened to score us
a copy of the discovery file.

452
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:32,492
Everything the DA has.

453
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:33,999
They would have had
to turn it over eventually,

454
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,626
but it would've taken a while.

455
00:23:35,753 --> 00:23:37,709
No, they don't have the other guy.

456
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:38,912
They don't even have the bar.

457
00:23:38,966 --> 00:23:41,754
So, what? All they've got is
Louis shows up at her apartment...

458
00:23:41,854 --> 00:23:44,090
and she gets beaten?

459
00:23:44,179 --> 00:23:46,094
That is such bullshit.

460
00:23:46,228 --> 00:23:48,298
Just keep telling me your story.

461
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,349
Okay.

462
00:23:51,487 --> 00:23:53,319
<i>I got there early.</i>

463
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:57,412
<i>And uh, waited until he came out.</i>

464
00:24:07,095 --> 00:24:08,164
Did you see what he was driving?

465
00:24:08,608 --> 00:24:10,046
<i>A blue mustang.</i>

466
00:24:29,882 --> 00:24:31,875
Alright, so he comes out, you go in?

467
00:24:32,218 --> 00:24:34,051
<i>She saw it was me.</i>

468
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,208
<i>And opened the door.</i>

469
00:24:35,306 --> 00:24:39,143
<i>Uh... the hallway was tight.</i>

470
00:24:39,305 --> 00:24:41,270
<i>So I had to...
walk pass her, you know...</i>

471
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,643
<i>So, she closed the door.</i>

472
00:24:43,696 --> 00:24:46,656
<i>So my back was to her and um...</i>

473
00:24:46,784 --> 00:24:48,696
<i>that was it.</i>

474
00:24:48,827 --> 00:24:51,743
-What was it?
-She hit me with something.

475
00:24:53,003 --> 00:24:55,962
I got down...
and everything got black fast.

476
00:24:57,508 --> 00:24:59,046
Show me where she hit you.

477
00:24:59,344 --> 00:25:00,335
Right here.

478
00:25:03,475 --> 00:25:04,467
Still hurts.

479
00:25:05,564 --> 00:25:07,557
And that blow knocked you out?

480
00:25:12,784 --> 00:25:15,699
<i>Next I know, 2 faggots were
sitting on me. Holding me down.</i>

481
00:25:15,956 --> 00:25:19,510
Police report has it, homosexual
couple from across the hall.

482
00:25:19,781 --> 00:25:21,114
They're dressed like faggots.

483
00:25:22,215 --> 00:25:25,256
I stand corrected.
Faggot couple from across the hall.

484
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:27,342
Go on, Louis.

485
00:25:28,392 --> 00:25:31,511
I was still foggy when the cops came.

486
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:34,039
<i>My name's Officer Maxwell, I just
need to ask you a few questions.</i>

487
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,679
<i>-Can you tell me your name, please?
-Reggie Campo.</i>

488
00:25:36,739 --> 00:25:37,613
<i>Do you know this gentleman?</i>

489
00:25:37,614 --> 00:25:38,832
<i>-You met him before?
-No!</i>

490
00:25:38,994 --> 00:25:40,826
<i>And that's when I saw she'd set me up.</i>

491
00:25:40,912 --> 00:25:42,983
-Set it up, how?
-She put blood on my hand.

492
00:25:43,493 --> 00:25:44,563
My left hand.

493
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,493
<i>He said he was gonna rape me.</i>

494
00:25:46,526 --> 00:25:47,586
<i>And kill me.</i>

495
00:25:47,956 --> 00:25:51,540
<i>And then he said he was gonna
come back here and rape me again.</i>

496
00:25:51,541 --> 00:25:53,628
You said she left the door
open a crack.

497
00:25:53,629 --> 00:25:55,234
Did you happen to see her face?

498
00:25:55,603 --> 00:25:56,590
Not all of it.

499
00:25:57,729 --> 00:25:58,767
Mainly her eye.

500
00:25:59,735 --> 00:26:02,077
Wait, her left eye?

501
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:02,962
Yes.

502
00:26:03,901 --> 00:26:05,596
Alright, so she already
had the injuries

503
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:06,960
to the right side of her face...

504
00:26:07,995 --> 00:26:09,111
She opens the door...

505
00:26:09,207 --> 00:26:11,121
conceals that from him.

506
00:26:11,211 --> 00:26:14,206
And as he enters,
she... she clobbers him.

507
00:26:14,341 --> 00:26:17,381
So, our case is what?

508
00:26:17,554 --> 00:26:18,588
She beat herself up?

509
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,436
If she already had the injuries...

510
00:26:20,437 --> 00:26:23,240
she either did just that or
she had a boyfriend do it.

511
00:26:23,744 --> 00:26:27,596
She must have. I mean, she saw
Louis' Maserati... his watch.

512
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,639
It's known the family has money.

513
00:26:30,378 --> 00:26:33,665
I'll weight you should be filing in
civil court the moment this is over.

514
00:26:34,466 --> 00:26:35,535
Let's hear the police report.

515
00:26:35,633 --> 00:26:36,823
How's Reggie telling?

516
00:26:38,682 --> 00:26:40,594
Okay, according to the victim...

517
00:26:40,686 --> 00:26:43,379
she was at home alone when the suspect
presented himself at the door...

518
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,817
as someone she knew.

519
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,424
Upon letting him in,
she was immediately struck.

520
00:26:47,434 --> 00:26:49,115
Does it say, he knocked her down?

521
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:53,944
Yes, there was a
struggle that continued

522
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:56,071
from the hallway to the stairs.

523
00:27:04,335 --> 00:27:07,417
He held the victim by the neck...

524
00:27:07,727 --> 00:27:10,044
and forced her down.
Suspect maintained the position...

525
00:27:10,054 --> 00:27:11,337
behind her...

526
00:27:11,645 --> 00:27:15,009
holding a knife against
the left side of her throat.

527
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:16,873
That's not my knife.

528
00:27:17,174 --> 00:27:18,459
Are his prints all here, Frank?

529
00:27:19,294 --> 00:27:21,777
Well, stands to reason,
if she put blood on his hand...

530
00:27:21,877 --> 00:27:22,975
she put his prints on the knife.

531
00:27:23,057 --> 00:27:25,197
I just told you though,
that isn't my knife.

532
00:27:25,296 --> 00:27:26,231
Keep talking Frank.

533
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:28,504
As Ms. Campo ran for the stairs...

534
00:27:28,514 --> 00:27:31,078
they fought and she kept
the intruder backwards.

535
00:27:31,088 --> 00:27:34,130
Realising her attacker had her
cornered she fought free and...

536
00:27:34,131 --> 00:27:36,060
seized a nearby bottle of vodka.

537
00:27:37,295 --> 00:27:38,604
And that's when she clogged him.

538
00:27:38,808 --> 00:27:39,907
That's her story.

539
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:40,861
Those are all lies.

540
00:27:43,041 --> 00:27:44,721
Look, if everything
she's saying is a lie...

541
00:27:44,722 --> 00:27:46,554
Then, this is going to
be the easiest case, ever.

542
00:27:47,872 --> 00:27:49,480
But you swear, it's all lies?

543
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:51,574
All of it?

544
00:27:52,628 --> 00:27:54,619
Are you sure there's not anything...

545
00:27:55,272 --> 00:27:56,491
that you're not telling me?

546
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,100
Nothing.

547
00:28:01,225 --> 00:28:02,342
Why did he choose you, Mick?

548
00:28:02,436 --> 00:28:06,397
Rich kid, spoiled as shit...
never heard the word 'no'...

549
00:28:06,605 --> 00:28:10,363
Yeah, but the damn thing is,
the way he tells his story, Frank.

550
00:28:10,607 --> 00:28:12,601
Just quite enough to be true.

551
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:15,695
I don't know, Mick.
This kid feels wrong to me.

552
00:28:15,905 --> 00:28:18,785
But, I'll check out his story.
All of it. You know the rules.

553
00:28:19,115 --> 00:28:21,868
Start at the Association bar.

554
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:26,160
And then, this Regina Campo.
The way he said she came on to her...

555
00:28:26,328 --> 00:28:27,283
sounds like a pro.

556
00:28:27,327 --> 00:28:30,535
Yeah, write it down.
Also, Mr... uh... Mr. Mustang?

557
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,035
Alright, now I still don't get
how that works.

558
00:28:33,036 --> 00:28:35,668
What? He and Reggie got into some
rough train then he punched her?

559
00:28:35,669 --> 00:28:37,274
Unless he was in on it.

560
00:28:38,285 --> 00:28:40,528
Meaning... he hit her afterwards?

561
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:41,432
Bingo.

562
00:28:42,925 --> 00:28:45,671
Jesus, Mick, are you starting
to think Louis is innocent?

563
00:28:45,681 --> 00:28:46,974
He just might.

564
00:28:48,094 --> 00:28:50,884
Besides, you know, my father always
said about an innocent client.

565
00:28:51,351 --> 00:28:52,266
No, I've never heard this. Hi...

566
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:55,303
He said 'there's no client
as scary as an innocent man'.

567
00:28:55,434 --> 00:28:56,504
That's right.

568
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,141
'Cos if you screw up and
he goes to prison...

569
00:28:59,142 --> 00:29:00,521
you're never gonna be able
to live with yourself.

570
00:29:01,374 --> 00:29:03,690
So, there's only one verdict
you can put on the board, baby...

571
00:29:03,816 --> 00:29:05,212
and that's an NG.

572
00:29:06,817 --> 00:29:08,184
What do you say, Mags?

573
00:29:09,246 --> 00:29:12,473
Frank, if you let a man drive
home in this condition...

574
00:29:12,474 --> 00:29:14,132
I think that I can charge you both.

575
00:29:16,023 --> 00:29:17,857
I'll take him to his house.

576
00:29:18,108 --> 00:29:19,178
How are you gonna get home?

577
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,658
Earl could pick up the
car for me in the morning.

578
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:23,863
I came with friends. Whoo!

579
00:29:29,445 --> 00:29:30,958
-Later.
-Thank you, baby!

580
00:29:33,283 --> 00:29:34,445
No, no, I got this.

581
00:29:34,455 --> 00:29:35,998
I insist.

582
00:30:02,057 --> 00:30:02,828
What?

583
00:30:05,277 --> 00:30:07,270
Moonlight becomes you.

584
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,559
You're not doing me any good, Haller.

585
00:30:25,106 --> 00:30:27,163
Hey, Mick!

586
00:30:30,421 --> 00:30:32,412
Jesus, Frank. What couldn't wait?

587
00:30:32,546 --> 00:30:34,426
Wanna watch a movie?

588
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:36,667
We caught a break.

589
00:30:36,718 --> 00:30:40,679
The owner had a camera system
set up last month.

590
00:30:41,804 --> 00:30:44,843
I had the... security tape
transferred to a disk.

591
00:30:44,973 --> 00:30:46,887
So I could manipulate...

592
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,937
I know this place.

593
00:30:49,058 --> 00:30:51,097
Alright, there's our boy, Louis.

594
00:30:52,144 --> 00:30:53,295
And I would like you to meet...

595
00:30:53,397 --> 00:30:54,441
Ms. Reggie Campo.

596
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,831
And there's... Mr. Mustang.

597
00:30:57,206 --> 00:30:58,057
Are you sure?

598
00:30:58,058 --> 00:31:00,517
I wouldn't have popped a grand
for the tape if I wasn't sure.

599
00:31:00,694 --> 00:31:01,904
Now, watch.

600
00:31:02,109 --> 00:31:04,126
Reggie gets up,
goes to the ladies room...

601
00:31:04,388 --> 00:31:07,500
Mr. Mustang chats up the bartender.
So that's where he goes...

602
00:31:07,501 --> 00:31:09,272
and give Reggie her chance...

603
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:10,264
watch her.

604
00:31:10,544 --> 00:31:12,018
Wait, that's not how he said
it went down.

605
00:31:12,074 --> 00:31:15,038
He said she gave him
her address on a napkin.

606
00:31:15,205 --> 00:31:17,116
Okay, hold on, hoss... hold on...

607
00:31:17,207 --> 00:31:19,200
Let her go pee. Okay, here she comes.

608
00:31:19,414 --> 00:31:21,217
There's your napkin.

609
00:31:22,417 --> 00:31:23,452
Now, watch this.

610
00:31:24,544 --> 00:31:27,459
She and Mr. Mustang decided
it's time to split...

611
00:31:27,588 --> 00:31:29,582
Look, look... look at his hand.
Look at his watch.

612
00:31:29,882 --> 00:31:31,760
So he's left handed. That's no good.

613
00:31:31,843 --> 00:31:35,725
Facial blows are from the left.
This guy's right handed.

614
00:31:35,886 --> 00:31:37,081
Mick, you haven't been
drinking enough.

615
00:31:37,137 --> 00:31:39,094
You said you knew the Association?

616
00:31:39,221 --> 00:31:43,740
You would realise, this shot is
into the mirror behind the bar.

617
00:31:43,896 --> 00:31:47,203
'Cos that's where the owner set up the
camera so he could watch his register!

618
00:31:47,204 --> 00:31:48,163
Everything is backwards.

619
00:31:48,315 --> 00:31:51,015
And Mr. Mustang punches with his left.

620
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:53,466
Yeah... you proud of yourself, Frank?

621
00:31:53,468 --> 00:31:54,870
I really, really am.

622
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,146
But not just about this.

623
00:31:57,159 --> 00:31:58,228
That feeling I had about Reggie?

624
00:31:58,328 --> 00:32:01,165
That she was selling it?
I did a little bit of research...

625
00:32:01,289 --> 00:32:02,280
she's our girl.

626
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:03,448
You tell me the cops don't have this?

627
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:06,499
How can they? There's only
one and it's not a copy.

628
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:07,615
Then make a copy.

629
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:09,589
What? You're gonna give
it to the prosecutor?

630
00:32:09,671 --> 00:32:11,663
Yeah, a new guy named, Ted Minton.

631
00:32:11,754 --> 00:32:13,713
He's gonna hand over
the discovery file.

632
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:14,868
Oh, poor bunny.

633
00:32:14,965 --> 00:32:16,798
He's not gonna know what hit him.

634
00:32:17,007 --> 00:32:19,000
How long 'til you think
your man's back?

635
00:32:19,093 --> 00:32:21,007
I don't know.
Probably just a few more minutes.

636
00:32:22,098 --> 00:32:23,086
Mr. Haller.

637
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:25,096
-There he is.
-Sorry to keep you waiting.

638
00:32:25,347 --> 00:32:28,388
-The discovery file.
-I hope this will be worth your while.

639
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,471
Kinda light.

640
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,553
You have somewhere we can play this?

641
00:32:43,987 --> 00:32:45,021
What else do you have?

642
00:32:47,239 --> 00:32:49,233
What else do I have?

643
00:32:51,449 --> 00:32:53,442
Come on, Minton.
Let's cut the bullshit here.

644
00:32:53,577 --> 00:32:56,573
Alright? Not only your
so-called victim a prostitute...

645
00:32:56,707 --> 00:32:59,543
but I have her soliciting
my guy on video.

646
00:33:00,667 --> 00:33:01,783
You think the jury's gonna see this...

647
00:33:01,833 --> 00:33:04,793
and think he had to rape her at
knife point just to have sex with her?

648
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,951
No.

649
00:33:06,005 --> 00:33:07,918
Are you listening to what I'm saying?

650
00:33:08,965 --> 00:33:11,114
Yes and it doesn't change the
offer I'm prepared to make.

651
00:33:12,216 --> 00:33:13,206
Offer?

652
00:33:14,342 --> 00:33:15,413
You going forward?

653
00:33:16,304 --> 00:33:18,295
We will drop down to
assault with the deadly.

654
00:33:18,428 --> 00:33:19,465
Attempted sexual battery.

655
00:33:19,556 --> 00:33:22,595
Guidelines put that on...
7 years, maybe he'll do 4?

656
00:33:26,813 --> 00:33:28,724
What am I missing here?

657
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:42,868
Hey, Frank!

658
00:33:45,959 --> 00:33:46,950
What's up?

659
00:33:47,044 --> 00:33:49,580
Look here.
These files look identical to me.

660
00:33:49,581 --> 00:33:51,809
Alright, there's something we're
missing and we're not seeing it.

661
00:33:53,382 --> 00:33:57,379
Well, here's the discovery file I got
from my clerk in the DA's office.

662
00:33:57,595 --> 00:33:59,015
And this is the one I got from Minton.

663
00:34:00,552 --> 00:34:02,159
-Reggie Campo.
-Reggie.

664
00:34:02,809 --> 00:34:04,315
-Here's the door chain.
-Uhm-hmm.

665
00:34:04,681 --> 00:34:05,609
Come on. It's the same.

666
00:34:06,265 --> 00:34:07,493
Wow... wow... wow...

667
00:34:07,495 --> 00:34:09,374
Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.

668
00:34:10,391 --> 00:34:11,427
Son of a bitch.

669
00:34:11,518 --> 00:34:13,757
They switched up the files.
This is a different knife.

670
00:34:13,758 --> 00:34:14,529
Hm-hm...

671
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:17,160
I've been taking care of this
guy for 10 years.

672
00:34:17,161 --> 00:34:18,124
And he set me up.

673
00:34:19,102 --> 00:34:20,720
Well, he's off the Christmas list.

674
00:34:20,775 --> 00:34:21,811
He's on the shit list.

675
00:34:25,988 --> 00:34:27,274
-Good shot, Eddie!
-Thank you, Jack.

676
00:34:30,071 --> 00:34:31,803
Looks a little short to me.

677
00:34:43,255 --> 00:34:44,923
You guys finish up.
I'll see you later.

678
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,028
-They've closed down anyway.
-Alright.

679
00:34:48,484 --> 00:34:49,227
Louis.

680
00:34:49,411 --> 00:34:50,995
So, what happened? Did you see Minton?

681
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,931
Oh, I saw him.

682
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,126
We need to talk.

683
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:56,207
You lied to me, Louis.

684
00:34:58,302 --> 00:35:01,298
You didn't tell me you were
paying Reggie Campo for sex.

685
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:07,553
I don't go lookin' surprised. Could've
easily told me that in Cecil's office.

686
00:35:07,768 --> 00:35:09,760
I don't want my mother to find out.

687
00:35:09,854 --> 00:35:11,813
Cecil tells her everything.

688
00:35:11,939 --> 00:35:14,932
Oh, so you decided to keep
from me the one thing...

689
00:35:15,066 --> 00:35:16,977
that could've made this trial go away?

690
00:35:17,108 --> 00:35:19,104
-Huh?
-Is that what Minton said?

691
00:35:19,196 --> 00:35:21,267
-No more trial?
-I said 'could have'.

692
00:35:21,362 --> 00:35:23,526
If that had been the only
lie you told me.

693
00:35:23,536 --> 00:35:24,545
What do you mean?

694
00:35:25,449 --> 00:35:26,438
Recognise that?

695
00:35:26,574 --> 00:35:28,453
It's a picture of your knife.

696
00:35:28,536 --> 00:35:30,528
The one you had on you
when you went to Reggie's.

697
00:35:30,744 --> 00:35:32,578
The one the cops have.

698
00:35:32,747 --> 00:35:35,500
That's why Ted Minton didn't focus
to answer shit, why should he?

699
00:35:35,501 --> 00:35:37,556
When he's got a knife
with her blood and your initial?

700
00:35:37,557 --> 00:35:38,950
That wasn't the knife that was
in the file.

701
00:35:39,083 --> 00:35:40,996
That's right, it wasn't.

702
00:35:41,086 --> 00:35:43,921
The file Frank got is what
we call a 'loaded deck'.

703
00:35:44,086 --> 00:35:47,633
The cops use it to set us up. To make
us think they didn't have anything.

704
00:35:47,634 --> 00:35:49,947
When in fact, they've got enough
to put your golf playing ass

705
00:35:49,948 --> 00:35:52,259
away for 20 years, big boy.

706
00:35:53,203 --> 00:35:54,763
Why did you lie about the knife?

707
00:35:56,703 --> 00:35:58,591
Louis, why would you lie
about anything?

708
00:35:59,433 --> 00:36:02,850
Everything you tell me's confidential.
Attorney client priviledges.

709
00:36:02,851 --> 00:36:06,013
Alright, I didn't lie. I said the
knife in the picture wasn't mine.

710
00:36:06,146 --> 00:36:08,947
I said it twice and
nobody listened to me.

711
00:36:09,105 --> 00:36:11,094
What are you now? The goddamn lawyer?

712
00:36:11,314 --> 00:36:13,308
You said it wasn't yours...

713
00:36:13,399 --> 00:36:16,316
what you should've said was
'I had a knife, Mick'.

714
00:36:16,446 --> 00:36:17,480
'But this isn't it'.

715
00:36:17,571 --> 00:36:20,564
You brought a weapon to a
meeting with a prostitute.

716
00:36:20,698 --> 00:36:22,755
You tell me,
how the hell am I supposed

717
00:36:22,756 --> 00:36:24,695
to make that look like she set you up?

718
00:36:27,871 --> 00:36:31,021
I... did not do this.

719
00:36:32,207 --> 00:36:34,038
It's custom made.

720
00:36:34,334 --> 00:36:37,817
It's a razor tip.
It's got your initials engraved...

721
00:36:37,818 --> 00:36:39,327
on the handle.

722
00:36:39,381 --> 00:36:40,414
I always carry it.

723
00:36:41,546 --> 00:36:43,539
We show homes to people we don't know!

724
00:36:48,844 --> 00:36:49,880
There's one time...

725
00:36:50,928 --> 00:36:52,443
my mother was showing a place.

726
00:36:52,444 --> 00:36:56,012
It was in Bel Air, so she
thought it was okay to go alone.

727
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:00,103
-He was there.
-Who was there?

728
00:37:02,481 --> 00:37:04,313
The man who raped her.

729
00:37:05,481 --> 00:37:06,517
When she didn't come back...

730
00:37:06,606 --> 00:37:08,564
I went to the house and found her.

731
00:37:08,649 --> 00:37:11,645
That's when she stopped
showing property.

732
00:37:11,819 --> 00:37:14,654
And I started carrying a knife.

733
00:37:14,862 --> 00:37:15,851
Always.

734
00:37:17,989 --> 00:37:20,108
-Your mother will have to testify.
-No, no, I don't want that.

735
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,112
I don't give a damn what you want.

736
00:37:23,288 --> 00:37:26,247
You wanna stay out of this shit
house, you do exactly as I tell you...

737
00:37:26,373 --> 00:37:28,251
from now on, you got it?

738
00:38:00,648 --> 00:38:01,717
-Hey...
-Hey...

739
00:38:01,814 --> 00:38:04,728
Success. We had fun.

740
00:38:08,029 --> 00:38:09,984
-Got her?
-Oh yeah.

741
00:38:14,284 --> 00:38:16,275
At least you did one thing right, huh?

742
00:38:16,365 --> 00:38:17,357
We did a couple.

743
00:38:17,535 --> 00:38:18,526
Good night.

744
00:38:31,002 --> 00:38:33,840
Well, look who's come calling.

745
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:35,119
Detective Kurlen.

746
00:38:35,171 --> 00:38:37,167
Hey, you been to San Quentin, lately?

747
00:38:37,301 --> 00:38:39,099
See our boy, Martinez?

748
00:38:40,511 --> 00:38:42,341
I asked you something.

749
00:38:42,593 --> 00:38:45,474
How's Martinez doing up there? He made
the pucker-up and kiss me team?

750
00:38:45,681 --> 00:38:47,514
I haven't talked to him.

751
00:38:47,767 --> 00:38:50,684
Right, I guess once they
plead guilty and go down,

752
00:38:50,685 --> 00:38:51,764
you don't have much use for 'em, huh?

753
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:56,971
But uh...

754
00:38:57,022 --> 00:38:58,138
he's away forever, right?

755
00:38:59,149 --> 00:39:00,185
He got life, yeah.

756
00:39:00,275 --> 00:39:02,267
So, he'll be out in 15.

757
00:39:02,357 --> 00:39:06,196
Too bad, 'cos his victim,
Donna Renteria, she's dead forever.

758
00:39:09,657 --> 00:39:11,615
How does someone like
you sleep at night?

759
00:39:11,741 --> 00:39:13,735
With all the scum you represent?

760
00:39:27,377 --> 00:39:28,367
Hey, Kurlen.

761
00:39:29,335 --> 00:39:30,327
Come here a second.

762
00:39:34,427 --> 00:39:35,496
I had a client once.

763
00:39:35,593 --> 00:39:38,474
He uh... decapitated his ex wife.

764
00:39:38,846 --> 00:39:42,843
-Kept her head in the refrigerator.
-Nice, sweet.

765
00:39:43,058 --> 00:39:45,858
The DA got greedy.

766
00:39:45,975 --> 00:39:48,012
Tried to pile on 2 unsolved murders...

767
00:39:48,144 --> 00:39:51,140
Tricked up the evidence,
to make it look like my guy did it.

768
00:39:51,271 --> 00:39:53,150
But you got your boy off.

769
00:39:53,274 --> 00:39:55,187
And he's out walking around
now, right?

770
00:39:55,356 --> 00:39:57,475
-Well, fuck you, Haller.
-No, fuck the DA.

771
00:39:57,609 --> 00:40:00,364
And the cops who helped him.

772
00:40:00,568 --> 00:40:02,561
It's called the justice system,
Kurlen.

773
00:40:02,655 --> 00:40:03,804
It's not the way it's supposed
to work.

774
00:40:19,543 --> 00:40:21,532
Well, look who's here?

775
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:24,428
-Kids... Maggie.
-Hey...

776
00:40:24,628 --> 00:40:25,665
You want a beer?

777
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:27,593
A cold beer. Scotty!

778
00:40:27,755 --> 00:40:28,792
-Yeah, Mick.
-Oh, we could share this.

779
00:40:28,882 --> 00:40:29,873
No, I'm good.

780
00:40:29,926 --> 00:40:32,760
Alright, alright.
We swapped spits before.

781
00:40:37,262 --> 00:40:40,099
Tell me about your uh...
your buddy, Minton.

782
00:40:41,225 --> 00:40:42,295
Who says he's my buddy?

783
00:40:42,353 --> 00:40:45,232
Well, he was saying that
you were good.

784
00:40:45,395 --> 00:40:47,352
With that guy, Corliss, right?

785
00:40:47,562 --> 00:40:48,553
Yeah.

786
00:40:48,605 --> 00:40:49,596
How did you know?

787
00:40:49,693 --> 00:40:51,649
You'll take the guy's head off
first down.

788
00:40:51,733 --> 00:40:53,724
Hope so. So what uh...

789
00:40:53,859 --> 00:40:55,818
Ted talked to you about Corliss?

790
00:40:56,904 --> 00:40:58,191
No, no, I sent him to Ted.

791
00:40:58,192 --> 00:41:01,265
He thought I was on the case
because I'm his first appearance.

792
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:05,233
But I should not be
telling you any of this.

793
00:41:05,324 --> 00:41:06,361
No, I knew.

794
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:09,209
Look, I knew a guy like Minton
wouldn't have bothered

795
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:10,864
putting a jailhouse snitch
on the stand.

796
00:41:12,401 --> 00:41:13,600
I mean, that's what he is, right?

797
00:41:14,749 --> 00:41:17,584
Can we just have a friendly
beer and not talk about work?

798
00:41:19,836 --> 00:41:21,794
Let's grab a table up back
and grab something to eat.

799
00:41:24,965 --> 00:41:26,001
We can talk about our daughter?

800
00:41:27,176 --> 00:41:28,167
Okay.

801
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:29,209
Yeah.

802
00:41:39,809 --> 00:41:42,804
I bet she didn't know 3D
movies could be so much fun.

803
00:41:44,771 --> 00:41:45,842
I was watching her.

804
00:41:47,941 --> 00:41:49,898
-Filling the cup.
-Right.

805
00:41:49,984 --> 00:41:51,978
Yeah.

806
00:41:54,153 --> 00:41:57,275
Hey, you didn't know Minton had
Corliss 'til I blabbed, did you?

807
00:41:58,493 --> 00:42:00,402
I knew he was on at something.

808
00:42:02,454 --> 00:42:04,649
Screw it, I'm not gonna defend Minton.
He fights too dirty.

809
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,698
-Is this from Maggie McPherson?
-Hey. ...

810
00:42:08,875 --> 00:42:10,867
You know there are lines
I won't cross.

811
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,949
Don't you?

812
00:42:17,297 --> 00:42:19,128
Can you give me a lift?

813
00:43:28,014 --> 00:43:30,053
{whispering] She's gonna wake
up and she's gonna see us here.

814
00:43:30,144 --> 00:43:31,215
{whispering] It's not fair.

815
00:43:33,143 --> 00:43:34,213
How did she get in here?

816
00:43:34,437 --> 00:43:36,316
She comes in when she has nightmares.

817
00:43:37,439 --> 00:43:39,395
How often does she have nightmares?

818
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:44,601
Don't start.

819
00:43:44,653 --> 00:43:46,646
You don't know what it's like
to raise a child alone.

820
00:43:55,201 --> 00:43:57,239
I'll leave. Come back in an hour...

821
00:43:57,370 --> 00:43:59,251
we'll go together to
pick up your car...

822
00:43:59,332 --> 00:44:00,366
Then, I can take Hayley to school.

823
00:44:00,415 --> 00:44:03,330
Just like that? You're gonna
start taking her to school?

824
00:44:05,711 --> 00:44:07,704
Do you remember what we
talked about last night?

825
00:44:07,798 --> 00:44:09,990
Yes, I remember what we
talked about last night.

826
00:44:09,999 --> 00:44:11,308
But I thought you were
just trying to get

827
00:44:11,309 --> 00:44:13,628
my head into your case
or get me in bed.

828
00:44:14,968 --> 00:44:16,881
Can't live with you, can I?

829
00:44:16,969 --> 00:44:19,087
No, you can't. Not when
you're being a defense lawyer.

830
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:21,259
Not when I'm trying to keep
dirt bags off the streets.

831
00:44:21,348 --> 00:44:23,145
And you keep putting them there.

832
00:44:23,222 --> 00:44:25,341
-Heard it all before, Mag!
-Hm-hm.

833
00:44:55,749 --> 00:44:57,501
Donna Renteria.

834
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:52,788
Oh, man, they have my
picture everywhere, man.

835
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:54,873
They're gonna bring me in anyway,
so I'm liked fucked.

836
00:45:54,999 --> 00:45:58,475
But you told Kurlen you were in her
apartment, right? He didn't have that.

837
00:45:58,485 --> 00:45:59,901
-No, no...
-He didn't have it.

838
00:45:59,902 --> 00:46:01,201
He didn't even have any prints.

839
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:02,790
No, but that's just... it was true...

840
00:46:03,205 --> 00:46:05,013
I saw her LaZona Beso...

841
00:46:05,023 --> 00:46:07,861
and she said, if I paid her more
money than the other guy...

842
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:09,507
then we can go to her place.

843
00:46:09,594 --> 00:46:11,098
Nobody saw any other guy.

844
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:13,673
There was another guy!
It was uh... it was uh...

845
00:46:13,683 --> 00:46:15,413
a white guy. He was right by the bar.

846
00:46:15,788 --> 00:46:18,131
The coroner says her vagina
was brutalised.

847
00:46:18,755 --> 00:46:19,767
Are you my lawyer, man?

848
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:20,712
-I'm trying to be.

849
00:46:20,713 --> 00:46:22,892
Look, when I left,
that chick was fine.

850
00:46:22,899 --> 00:46:24,209
Look, I slept with her, okay.

851
00:46:24,604 --> 00:46:26,269
I did, but I didn't hurt her.
I promise.

852
00:46:26,399 --> 00:46:29,279
Three people saw you throw
a knife into the LA river, huh.

853
00:46:29,401 --> 00:46:31,473
-Huh? Help me.
-I had that knife in my car.

854
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:34,104
I knew they were gonna find it, man.
They were gonna pin it on me.

855
00:46:34,105 --> 00:46:34,627
I know!

856
00:46:34,628 --> 00:46:36,493
Look, if all you did was have
sex with her...

857
00:46:36,656 --> 00:46:38,694
then why didn't you
leave any prints, huh?

858
00:46:38,783 --> 00:46:40,424
I mean the place was wiped down clean.

859
00:46:40,425 --> 00:46:41,744
I didn't wipe it down, though!

860
00:46:41,869 --> 00:46:42,985
You left semen on the towel?

861
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:45,879
You remember that?
Did you forget the towel?

862
00:46:45,996 --> 00:46:47,191
No! I didn't forget anything man!

863
00:46:47,246 --> 00:46:50,161
I just used that towel,
I paid her and I left.

864
00:46:50,373 --> 00:46:52,207
That defense ain't gonna make.

865
00:46:52,213 --> 00:46:54,411
-Dude, don't say that!
-It won't make, man.

866
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:56,581
There's not a chance in
hell with that defense.

867
00:46:57,505 --> 00:46:59,464
-You know what they're asking for?
-What?

868
00:47:00,715 --> 00:47:01,831
They want the death penalty, man.

869
00:47:01,882 --> 00:47:04,763
They wanna take your ass down.
They wanna burn you, man.

870
00:47:05,887 --> 00:47:06,875
Listen.

871
00:47:07,054 --> 00:47:09,934
I can see to it that,
that never... happened.

872
00:47:10,054 --> 00:47:11,171
But not if you don't plead.

873
00:47:11,266 --> 00:47:13,555
Oh, you want me to say I did it?

874
00:47:14,313 --> 00:47:16,223
There's a deal to be made here.

875
00:47:16,354 --> 00:47:17,343
And I can do it.

876
00:47:18,354 --> 00:47:19,424
I can get you life.

877
00:47:20,438 --> 00:47:22,558
Now, life means you're paroled in 15.

878
00:47:23,732 --> 00:47:25,727
It keeps the needle
out of your arm, man.

879
00:47:26,694 --> 00:47:27,730
It's our only play, man.

880
00:47:29,821 --> 00:47:32,895
This parole... you know what it means?
That means I didn't do it!

881
00:47:33,032 --> 00:47:34,101
That's the best I can get
for you, man.

882
00:47:34,199 --> 00:47:36,999
I don't wanna go to jail for
something I didn't do, man.

883
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:39,707
You know what's that's
gonna do to my mom, bro?

884
00:47:42,006 --> 00:47:44,863
I ain't going to jail for
something I didn't do, bro!

885
00:47:47,669 --> 00:47:49,340
Come on, man.

886
00:47:54,799 --> 00:47:56,789
Please help me, bro. Please help me.

887
00:48:31,534 --> 00:48:34,368
<b>California State Prison San Quentin</b>

888
00:48:46,003 --> 00:48:48,074
I'm not gonna ask how you are,
'cos I know.

889
00:48:48,211 --> 00:48:51,048
No, bro.

890
00:48:51,173 --> 00:48:52,165
You don't know.

891
00:48:53,342 --> 00:48:56,336
But I need to ask you some
questions, Jesus.

892
00:48:56,468 --> 00:48:58,382
Oh, questions?

893
00:48:58,637 --> 00:48:59,627
Now?

894
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:04,671
You know what? You didn't ask
me a lot of questions back then.

895
00:49:04,848 --> 00:49:07,843
You never asked me,
'Did you kill her?'

896
00:49:07,976 --> 00:49:09,776
No.

897
00:49:09,895 --> 00:49:13,938
Please, I'm trying to make this right.

898
00:49:15,274 --> 00:49:17,469
I need you to tell me what
happened at the

899
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:20,069
LaZona Beso bar that night,
one more time.

900
00:49:21,444 --> 00:49:22,434
Please.

901
00:49:26,741 --> 00:49:28,573
She was workin'.

902
00:49:32,706 --> 00:49:33,430
<i>I liked her.</i>

903
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:36,216
<i>You know, out of the bat, I liked her.
I know she was the one, you know.</i>

904
00:49:37,165 --> 00:49:38,647
<i>You know, she caught my eye.</i>

905
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,001
<i>They were going around in
a little circle, you know.</i>

906
00:49:44,206 --> 00:49:45,786
<i>She was acting all cute and shit.</i>

907
00:49:49,675 --> 00:49:52,080
Listen, I don't know how this
works out, you know...

908
00:49:52,081 --> 00:49:52,589
I don't know...

909
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:53,738
No, it's fine. You wanna dance?

910
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,990
Yeah, I wanna dance.

911
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:57,319
I can give you a private dance.

912
00:49:57,792 --> 00:49:58,884
I picked her.

913
00:49:59,541 --> 00:50:01,135
I asked her to dance for me.

914
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:04,176
<i>And we started talking.</i>

915
00:50:04,227 --> 00:50:06,735
<i>You know, she said...
I could take her home.</i>

916
00:50:07,038 --> 00:50:08,437
So, how much for me to come over?

917
00:50:08,721 --> 00:50:11,826
Well, usually I charge a thousand.
But for you...

918
00:50:11,836 --> 00:50:13,983
$300, 'cos you're sexy.

919
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:16,193
<i>And she was good, man, yeah.</i>

920
00:50:16,338 --> 00:50:17,024
<i>So I did.</i>

921
00:50:18,037 --> 00:50:19,207
But I ain't kill her.

922
00:50:20,948 --> 00:50:23,498
You said there was another guy, right?

923
00:50:24,193 --> 00:50:24,646
Yeah.

924
00:50:25,378 --> 00:50:26,456
She was talking to him.

925
00:50:37,626 --> 00:50:38,735
And then she came back to me.

926
00:50:40,911 --> 00:50:41,409
Okay.

927
00:50:45,924 --> 00:50:47,509
I got some pictures, alright?
Some mug shots.

928
00:50:49,054 --> 00:50:50,968
Jesus, see if you can ID...

929
00:50:51,713 --> 00:50:53,212
that other guy at the club.

930
00:50:55,225 --> 00:50:56,708
Tell me if you recognise him.

931
00:50:57,307 --> 00:50:58,297
No.

932
00:51:00,476 --> 00:51:02,435
How about this guy, Jesus?

933
00:51:03,648 --> 00:51:04,683
Recognise him?

934
00:51:04,731 --> 00:51:05,722
Uh-uh.

935
00:51:05,775 --> 00:51:07,653
Okay, take your time.

936
00:51:10,902 --> 00:51:12,781
Yeah, yeah. This guy?

937
00:51:12,905 --> 00:51:13,976
Is this the other guy?

938
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:16,989
Is this guy in the club that night?

939
00:51:17,073 --> 00:51:18,064
Guard!

940
00:51:18,114 --> 00:51:20,107
-Jesus.
-You know who it was?

941
00:51:20,201 --> 00:51:22,158
-Is this the other guy?
-Why you play me, bro?

942
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:23,399
Why are you bothering me
with this anymore?

943
00:51:23,454 --> 00:51:25,491
-Jesus, is that the guy?
-What does it matter, man?

944
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:27,615
I'm right here.
Right where you wanted me, bro!

945
00:51:27,707 --> 00:51:29,584
Is this the guy? This is the guy?

946
00:51:29,664 --> 00:51:30,868
You know what? I don't trust you, dog!

947
00:51:30,869 --> 00:51:32,624
Jesus, I'm trying to make it right!

948
00:51:32,625 --> 00:51:34,745
-I never will!
-Interview's over.

949
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,032
Okay, that's my boy, that's my boy...

950
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:39,384
Get out of here, yeah!

951
00:51:41,435 --> 00:51:44,147
Hey! You okay?
Where've you been today?

952
00:51:44,261 --> 00:51:45,005
I've been trying to call you.

953
00:51:46,679 --> 00:51:47,675
I've been to San Quentin.

954
00:51:49,916 --> 00:51:51,743
To see Jesus Martinez.

955
00:51:55,019 --> 00:51:56,457
About what happened after...

956
00:51:57,045 --> 00:51:58,679
He left Donna Renteria's apartment.

957
00:51:58,812 --> 00:52:00,872
-After he killed her?
-He didn't kill her, Frank.

958
00:52:01,901 --> 00:52:02,935
He went there.

959
00:52:03,064 --> 00:52:04,101
He had sex.

960
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:06,028
Flushed the condom down the toilet.

961
00:52:06,151 --> 00:52:08,592
Wiped his his prick on a pink
towel and then he went home.

962
00:52:08,593 --> 00:52:09,651
But he didn't kill her.

963
00:52:10,129 --> 00:52:12,692
Come on, Mick, we've been
through this a hundred times.

964
00:52:13,934 --> 00:52:14,691
<i>The real killer...</i>

965
00:52:15,561 --> 00:52:16,398
<i>She let's him in.</i>

966
00:52:16,534 --> 00:52:19,605
<i>Maybe uh... he faked like
he was Martinez's friend</i>

967
00:52:19,606 --> 00:52:21,564
<i>and acted like he had an appointment.</i>

968
00:52:23,208 --> 00:52:24,215
<i>Like the guy in the bar?</i>

969
00:52:24,457 --> 00:52:27,904
<i>Right. He comes in. He punches her.
He tries to snuff her out.</i>

970
00:52:29,085 --> 00:52:30,884
<i>She's not gonna be lucky
like Reggie Campo.</i>

971
00:52:30,894 --> 00:52:32,637
<i>'Cos this time,
the bitch pulls a knife.</i>

972
00:52:33,148 --> 00:52:34,630
<i>He takes her and dings her
over the table.</i>

973
00:52:34,631 --> 00:52:36,085
<i>Puts on a condom and rapes her.</i>

974
00:52:36,296 --> 00:52:37,413
<i>And when he's done...</i>

975
00:52:37,899 --> 00:52:39,967
<i>She was stabbed... over and over...</i>

976
00:52:40,036 --> 00:52:44,394
<i>52 times while he worked something
out of his sick goddamn mind.</i>

977
00:52:45,502 --> 00:52:47,105
Do I have to tell you
what kind of knife it was?

978
00:52:48,141 --> 00:52:49,405
A short blade folding knife?

979
00:52:49,811 --> 00:52:51,361
Just like Roulet's.

980
00:52:52,103 --> 00:52:55,941
Okay, okay, let's take it a
little bit easier on that, okay?

981
00:52:56,107 --> 00:52:57,301
Why, Frank? Why didn't I listen?

982
00:52:57,355 --> 00:52:59,555
Now listen!
Listen, I got a baseball bat

983
00:52:59,556 --> 00:53:01,130
-if you really wanna beat yourself up.
-No...

984
00:53:01,132 --> 00:53:03,982
I don't wanna beat myself up. Son
of a bitch told me he didn't do it.

985
00:53:04,498 --> 00:53:06,087
Alright! There was the DNA.

986
00:53:06,395 --> 00:53:08,305
And there was the knife
that he ditched.

987
00:53:08,306 --> 00:53:10,221
But there was no way I was
gonna listen to him.

988
00:53:10,258 --> 00:53:12,746
There was no way I would
believe that he didn't do it.

989
00:53:12,867 --> 00:53:13,921
I couldn't believe him!

990
00:53:14,943 --> 00:53:16,591
I couldn't believe, that I actually...

991
00:53:16,954 --> 00:53:18,965
Could represent an innocent man.

992
00:53:20,287 --> 00:53:21,645
Just like my father warned me about.

993
00:53:21,655 --> 00:53:24,177
Mick, come on,
they all said they didn't do it.

994
00:53:24,251 --> 00:53:25,650
-You know that.
-So, what did I do?

995
00:53:26,216 --> 00:53:27,293
I get him to plead.

996
00:53:27,379 --> 00:53:29,337
I get his sister to beg him to plead.

997
00:53:29,465 --> 00:53:31,207
'Cos he got no case.

998
00:53:32,171 --> 00:53:33,311
So I gave him the best deal I can.

999
00:53:33,312 --> 00:53:35,090
You know, I feel pretty
goddamn good about it.

1000
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:37,046
'Cos hey, I got the son
of a bitch off death row.

1001
00:53:37,348 --> 00:53:39,392
I got him 15 years
instead of the needle.

1002
00:53:39,971 --> 00:53:40,963
Yeah.

1003
00:53:52,281 --> 00:53:53,588
I showed him Roulet's picture.

1004
00:53:55,219 --> 00:53:56,031
Okay.

1005
00:53:57,651 --> 00:54:00,124
Roulet is using Martinez
as the other guy in the bar.

1006
00:54:01,181 --> 00:54:02,796
Like Mr. Mustang in this case?

1007
00:54:04,348 --> 00:54:07,206
So, he's not just getting off
and killing women.

1008
00:54:07,505 --> 00:54:10,641
It's seeing somebody else do
the time. That's his MO.

1009
00:54:11,917 --> 00:54:12,976
What did Martinez say?

1010
00:54:14,187 --> 00:54:15,042
Enough.

1011
00:54:16,499 --> 00:54:18,410
Enough for me to know.
I gotta... I gotta find...

1012
00:54:18,499 --> 00:54:21,242
What you gotta do,
is find a way to put Roulet in

1013
00:54:21,243 --> 00:54:22,816
Renteria's apartment the night
she was murdered.

1014
00:54:22,817 --> 00:54:23,796
-That's what you gotta do.
-I have to find a way

1015
00:54:23,797 --> 00:54:24,738
to make it right, Frank.

1016
00:54:24,744 --> 00:54:25,743
I gotta make it right.

1017
00:54:25,796 --> 00:54:28,871
Well, you can't bring him to
the cops 'cos he's your client.

1018
00:54:30,135 --> 00:54:32,890
And you can't take him to the
DA 'cos you'll lose your licence.

1019
00:54:33,053 --> 00:54:36,735
Worse, any evidence we found
would be inadmissible...

1020
00:54:36,736 --> 00:54:38,315
attorney client priviledge.

1021
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:43,193
It'll ruin any case that we
could ever have against him.

1022
00:54:47,032 --> 00:54:48,907
That's why the
son of a bitch hired me.

1023
00:54:53,159 --> 00:54:55,150
He's got me in his trick bag.

1024
00:54:56,058 --> 00:54:57,245
You got one client in jail

1025
00:54:58,337 --> 00:54:59,734
for what your other client did.

1026
00:55:04,792 --> 00:55:06,671
What are you gonna do, Mick?

1027
00:55:42,763 --> 00:55:45,637
<i>-Hey, Mick, you okay, buddy?</i>
-Frank, Frank, listen to me. I got it.

1028
00:55:45,638 --> 00:55:47,501
<i>-What?</i>
-You know how Roulet said all

1029
00:55:47,502 --> 00:55:49,524
we'll find on him
is parking tickets, right?

1030
00:55:49,525 --> 00:55:51,403
<i>- Right.</i>
- Listen! I don't buy that anymore.

1031
00:55:51,485 --> 00:55:52,557
Now, there are others.

1032
00:55:52,655 --> 00:55:53,962
Other girls he did.

1033
00:55:53,972 --> 00:55:57,211
Renteria and Campo, I mean,
they look too much alike.

1034
00:55:57,221 --> 00:55:59,323
Like their sisters.
And the injury to the

1035
00:55:59,324 --> 00:56:01,202
right side of their face
is too similar, man.

1036
00:56:01,993 --> 00:56:03,323
This guy's got a type, Frank.

1037
00:56:04,090 --> 00:56:06,321
There are other cases out there.
And you could find them.

1038
00:56:06,355 --> 00:56:07,202
Alright, you gotta do this, I can't.

1039
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:10,173
-I'm his lawyer.
<i>-Okay, okay, I'm on it.</i>

1040
00:56:10,334 --> 00:56:11,450
Alright. I gotta take this.

1041
00:56:12,459 --> 00:56:15,374
-Maggie, hey.
<i>-Hey, did you get my voicemail?</i>

1042
00:56:15,502 --> 00:56:17,541
Uh, I've been up at San Quentin
to see an old client.

1043
00:56:17,713 --> 00:56:18,704
How's Hayley?

1044
00:56:18,756 --> 00:56:20,714
<i>She's good.
She's got soccer this weekend.</i>

1045
00:56:21,968 --> 00:56:23,767
Saturday, right?

1046
00:56:23,844 --> 00:56:25,881
<i>-Hm-hm.</i>
-I look forward to it.

1047
00:56:25,970 --> 00:56:27,927
<i>Great. Talk later.</i>

1048
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:05,575
If you're wondering how I got in...

1049
00:57:05,665 --> 00:57:08,625
I'm in real estate, so, if I
wanna get into a friend's house...

1050
00:57:08,794 --> 00:57:09,783
No, we're not friends.

1051
00:57:10,962 --> 00:57:12,795
You're my client.

1052
00:57:13,922 --> 00:57:14,993
I'm your lawyer.

1053
00:57:16,131 --> 00:57:17,121
My lawyer.

1054
00:57:18,135 --> 00:57:21,127
See, that's exactly what
I wanted to remind you of.

1055
00:57:21,261 --> 00:57:23,332
I'm about to go on trial.

1056
00:57:24,346 --> 00:57:25,338
And yet...

1057
00:57:25,389 --> 00:57:26,457
I can't reach you.

1058
00:57:27,641 --> 00:57:30,396
Now I found out where
you were all day.

1059
00:57:30,685 --> 00:57:32,518
Heard you tell Maggie.

1060
00:57:32,645 --> 00:57:35,718
-You shit.
-You went to see Jesus Martinez.

1061
00:57:35,855 --> 00:57:37,927
And I know what you talked about.

1062
00:57:40,151 --> 00:57:41,334
Donna Renteria.

1063
00:57:43,145 --> 00:57:44,007
You're right, Mick.

1064
00:57:46,826 --> 00:57:47,586
I killed her.

1065
00:57:50,189 --> 00:57:52,490
There. No reason I shouldn't tell
my own lawyer.

1066
00:57:52,491 --> 00:57:54,447
Since it's all confidential.

1067
00:57:55,267 --> 00:57:57,387
Attorney client priviledge.

1068
00:57:57,518 --> 00:57:59,432
Isn't that what you told me?

1069
00:58:02,598 --> 00:58:04,592
It's time for you to go, Louis.

1070
00:58:06,886 --> 00:58:07,875
Alright.

1071
00:58:18,171 --> 00:58:21,166
That's a cute picture
of your daughter, Hayley.

1072
00:58:21,419 --> 00:58:23,250
She's very pretty.

1073
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,753
She's got soccer
practice tomorrow, right?

1074
00:58:25,754 --> 00:58:26,499
Don't.

1075
00:58:28,704 --> 00:58:29,693
Don't what?

1076
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:33,818
You think you're the first client to
ever threaten me with my family? Huh?

1077
00:58:33,952 --> 00:58:35,830
All I said was she's pretty.

1078
00:58:38,115 --> 00:58:40,028
Are you scared, Louis?

1079
00:58:41,238 --> 00:58:43,231
Because where you are, right now...

1080
00:58:46,404 --> 00:58:48,315
you're in a very dangerous place.

1081
00:59:11,026 --> 00:59:12,944
<i>And so, in conclusion...</i>

1082
00:59:13,870 --> 00:59:14,874
<i>What this case is about...</i>

1083
00:59:15,872 --> 00:59:17,283
<i>What this case is all about...</i>

1084
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:19,396
<i>is a predator.</i>

1085
00:59:20,388 --> 00:59:21,458
On that night of March 6th...

1086
00:59:21,553 --> 00:59:24,555
Louis Roulet was out stalking
his prey.

1087
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:28,598
Now, you're going to hear from the
victim herself, about her lifestyle...

1088
00:59:28,725 --> 00:59:30,802
One that we would not condone.

1089
00:59:31,938 --> 00:59:32,931
But remember.

1090
00:59:33,981 --> 00:59:34,972
Anyone.

1091
00:59:35,105 --> 00:59:36,097
Anyone.

1092
00:59:36,151 --> 00:59:38,114
Can be a victim of a violent crime.

1093
00:59:39,111 --> 00:59:40,182
This case is clear.

1094
00:59:41,239 --> 00:59:42,309
It's straight forward.

1095
00:59:43,408 --> 00:59:46,370
A man attacked a woman in her home.

1096
00:59:46,488 --> 00:59:48,566
In order to rape and kill her.

1097
00:59:48,659 --> 00:59:51,501
And it is only by the grace of God.

1098
00:59:51,791 --> 00:59:53,670
That she's here to tell her story.

1099
00:59:53,830 --> 00:59:54,903
Ladies and gentlemen.

1100
00:59:54,958 --> 00:59:56,839
My name is Michael Haller.

1101
00:59:56,959 --> 00:59:58,919
And I'm representing Louis Roulet.

1102
01:00:01,128 --> 01:00:02,199
Now, Mr. Minton...

1103
01:00:04,218 --> 01:00:06,130
doesn't wanna use the
word prostitute...

1104
01:00:06,214 --> 01:00:09,179
For the woman who was
supposed to be Louis' victim.

1105
01:00:10,512 --> 01:00:12,347
He needn't worry.

1106
01:00:12,639 --> 01:00:15,638
Because this case isn't about
how she makes her money.

1107
01:00:17,684 --> 01:00:19,679
This case is about her actions.

1108
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:23,652
How she saw a young man with
signs of wealth...

1109
01:00:23,653 --> 01:00:25,943
as a ticket out of the life
she was in.

1110
01:00:26,067 --> 01:00:28,063
And chose to target him.

1111
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:32,276
Now, what she didn't count on,
was you.

1112
01:00:34,406 --> 01:00:35,938
How you put two and two together...

1113
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:37,795
and let your common sense tell you...

1114
01:00:39,223 --> 01:00:41,540
who the real predator is,
in this case.

1115
01:00:43,708 --> 01:00:45,120
Thank you for your time.

1116
01:00:46,551 --> 01:00:47,925
The court will adjourn until Monday.

1117
01:00:48,002 --> 01:00:49,916
And the state will
call its first witness.

1118
01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:52,132
Go, Hayley, go! Turn, turn, turn!

1119
01:00:54,339 --> 01:00:56,222
Left foot! Left foot!

1120
01:01:03,765 --> 01:01:04,756
Hey, Mick.

1121
01:01:08,810 --> 01:01:10,773
Hey, Maggie.

1122
01:01:10,856 --> 01:01:11,846
What are you doing here?

1123
01:01:11,896 --> 01:01:13,047
I'm going to take Hayley home.

1124
01:01:13,146 --> 01:01:15,061
You've got some place to be.

1125
01:01:17,152 --> 01:01:18,269
What are you talking about?
What happened?

1126
01:01:29,701 --> 01:01:30,650
Hey... sir, stop.

1127
01:01:30,651 --> 01:01:31,996
-Please.
-Ma'am, I'm family.

1128
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:33,486
-Sir!
-Family.

1129
01:01:42,173 --> 01:01:44,328
-This is a closed crime scene.
-Sorry, name's Mick Haller.

1130
01:01:44,425 --> 01:01:47,308
-And that's Sobel. Sobel!
-Yeah, yeah, yeah...

1131
01:01:47,428 --> 01:01:48,545
Listen, slow down a second.

1132
01:01:48,594 --> 01:01:49,558
-Slow down.
-What happened?

1133
01:01:49,559 --> 01:01:51,690
Somebody shot him.
In the chest and the head.

1134
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:53,420
And they... they shot the dog too.

1135
01:01:55,708 --> 01:01:56,908
His body is right in front
of the door.

1136
01:01:58,854 --> 01:02:00,848
Great, this is what we need.

1137
01:02:16,536 --> 01:02:19,614
So you've uh... been here before. You
can tell us if anything is unusual.

1138
01:02:20,829 --> 01:02:21,822
Anything weird?

1139
01:02:21,874 --> 01:02:23,871
Like, throughout this whole house...

1140
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,801
why is it that all I see
are pictures of this guy?

1141
01:02:31,255 --> 01:02:33,251
My partner's asking
if Frank Levin was gay?

1142
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:36,339
-Is that relevant?
-Yeah, it's all relevant.

1143
01:02:37,384 --> 01:02:38,422
He's an ex cop.

1144
01:02:38,469 --> 01:02:40,588
Cops against persons in Chicago.

1145
01:02:40,721 --> 01:02:43,561
Is that botch enough for you,
Lankford?

1146
01:02:44,768 --> 01:02:46,764
I don't see anything
that I can help you here.

1147
01:02:46,978 --> 01:02:48,733
Alright, hey, Haller.

1148
01:02:49,106 --> 01:02:51,174
I don't need to tell you
to stick around town,

1149
01:02:51,175 --> 01:02:52,479
where I can find you, do I?

1150
01:02:54,231 --> 01:02:55,269
Am I a suspect?

1151
01:02:55,901 --> 01:02:56,323
Yeah.

1152
01:02:59,405 --> 01:03:01,321
When do you retire, Lankford?

1153
01:03:03,408 --> 01:03:04,639
-When do I retire?
-Yeah.

1154
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:06,536
18 months, why?

1155
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:11,667
I make sure I show the next
one so I can kick your ass.

1156
01:03:55,577 --> 01:03:56,568
Val!

1157
01:04:00,789 --> 01:04:03,915
Hey, Mick! What the hell you banging
on the door like that for, man?

1158
01:04:04,083 --> 01:04:05,120
Are you nuts?

1159
01:04:05,167 --> 01:04:07,129
Dude, dude, you look terrible.

1160
01:04:07,254 --> 01:04:09,213
Frank Levin was murdered.

1161
01:04:09,338 --> 01:04:11,252
Oh man, I'm sorry.

1162
01:04:11,379 --> 01:04:13,376
-I'm sorry to hear that.
-Roulet did it.

1163
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:16,050
Roulet? I thought you and
Frank were defending...

1164
01:04:16,051 --> 01:04:17,025
Why would he take Frank out?

1165
01:04:17,035 --> 01:04:18,004
That makes no sense.

1166
01:04:18,678 --> 01:04:22,729
You know, Val. I figure you
know exactly how it went down.

1167
01:04:22,892 --> 01:04:24,798
How would I know about it?
What are you talking about?

1168
01:04:25,010 --> 01:04:26,044
'Cos you lied to me.

1169
01:04:26,860 --> 01:04:28,539
You didn't send me the Roulet case.

1170
01:04:28,805 --> 01:04:31,158
-He asked for me.
-Okay, okay, that's true, man.

1171
01:04:31,159 --> 01:04:31,583
That's true...

1172
01:04:31,584 --> 01:04:33,853
But you know what I said?
'Haller's your man, go for Haller'.

1173
01:04:34,102 --> 01:04:35,034
I did that for you.

1174
01:04:35,237 --> 01:04:36,766
You lied to me once.

1175
01:04:37,361 --> 01:04:39,043
So what? Do you think
I would lie about this?

1176
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:40,590
Give me a little respect,
give me a little credit.

1177
01:04:40,591 --> 01:04:42,059
I'm not gonna lie about
this kind of shit.

1178
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:44,554
The police checked the tracer
that you put on Roulet.

1179
01:04:44,555 --> 01:04:45,805
It says he was no way
near Frank's house.

1180
01:04:45,806 --> 01:04:47,621
-So maybe it wasn't him, Mick.
-No.

1181
01:04:47,622 --> 01:04:49,577
So maybe it wasn't him.
Nobody can beat the tracer, huh?

1182
01:04:49,587 --> 01:04:51,772
It was him. Roulet killed Frank.

1183
01:04:51,773 --> 01:04:52,794
-Val, it was Roulet.
-I don't like...

1184
01:04:52,795 --> 01:04:53,863
I don't like the way you're
following me...

1185
01:04:53,864 --> 01:04:55,009
I don't like the way you
corner me, man.

1186
01:04:55,010 --> 01:04:56,405
I don't like the way you're
talking to me, okay?

1187
01:04:56,425 --> 01:04:58,220
Roulet killed Frank, Val.

1188
01:04:58,221 --> 01:05:00,320
What do you think? You think I cut the
kid loose, so he could murder Frank?

1189
01:05:00,321 --> 01:05:02,076
Crazy Roulet killed Frank!

1190
01:05:02,077 --> 01:05:04,459
Mick, I'm sorry about Frank,
but I didn't do it, man.

1191
01:05:04,552 --> 01:05:07,355
You're the only one
that could've taken it off him.

1192
01:05:44,208 --> 01:05:49,091
Being married to you sucked.
But being your car service...

1193
01:05:54,509 --> 01:05:55,503
Maggie.

1194
01:05:55,554 --> 01:05:56,338
Yeah?

1195
01:05:56,339 --> 01:05:59,474
You know what I used to
be afraid of, Maggie?

1196
01:05:59,639 --> 01:06:00,792
Yeah... me.

1197
01:06:00,892 --> 01:06:03,695
That I wouldn't recognise
the innocents.

1198
01:06:05,270 --> 01:06:08,313
That they'll be right there in front
of me, but I just wouldn't see it.

1199
01:06:09,064 --> 01:06:10,053
Yeah.

1200
01:06:11,272 --> 01:06:13,156
You know, when I talked to Minton...

1201
01:06:14,278 --> 01:06:17,402
guilty or not guilty,
just as innocent, you know?

1202
01:06:18,572 --> 01:06:20,406
You know what I'm afraid of now?

1203
01:06:22,338 --> 01:06:23,104
Evil.

1204
01:06:25,553 --> 01:06:26,516
Pure evil.

1205
01:06:29,035 --> 01:06:30,124
Maggie...

1206
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:33,366
did I get Frank Levin killed?

1207
01:06:35,169 --> 01:06:36,322
Micky, no.

1208
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:42,986
Uh-huh! Go to sleep.

1209
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:10,531
<i>New message, yesterday, 11:07 am.</i>

1210
01:07:11,009 --> 01:07:12,561
<i>Mick, it's me,
I tried you on your cell...</i>

1211
01:07:12,902 --> 01:07:14,583
<i>Sorry to interrupt your date
with Hayley, but...</i>

1212
01:07:14,729 --> 01:07:16,601
<i>you asked me to do some
digging... on Roulet?</i>

1213
01:07:16,958 --> 01:07:20,240
<i>Well, I might have found
Martinez's ticket, Micky.</i>

1214
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:21,246
<i>His ticket out of Quentin.</i>

1215
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:23,553
<i>-Uh...
-Your dog...</i>

1216
01:07:23,661 --> 01:07:24,515
<i>Someone's at the door.</i>

1217
01:07:24,533 --> 01:07:26,382
<i>Look, you go and you have
a good time with Hayley.</i>

1218
01:07:26,390 --> 01:07:28,258
<i>And I'll fill you in when
I know it's for sure.</i>

1219
01:07:28,308 --> 01:07:28,817
<i>I gotta go.</i>

1220
01:07:38,261 --> 01:07:39,838
-Detective Sobel.
<i>-Sobel, Mick Haller here.</i>

1221
01:07:40,103 --> 01:07:41,468
Listen, I just checked my messages.

1222
01:07:41,608 --> 01:07:44,630
It turns out, Frank called
me just before he was killed.

1223
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:47,143
The message came in at 11:07.

1224
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:49,267
He said he found something.
Something that could help

1225
01:07:49,268 --> 01:07:50,629
an old client of ours
get out of prison.

1226
01:07:51,118 --> 01:07:52,086
<i>Okay, who's the client?</i>

1227
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:54,536
<i>Jesus Martinez. He's in San Quentin.</i>

1228
01:07:54,764 --> 01:07:55,912
Okay, did he say anything else?

1229
01:07:56,108 --> 01:07:57,281
<i>Yeah, he made a joke.</i>

1230
01:07:57,510 --> 01:07:58,832
<i>Uh... he said something about</i>

1231
01:07:58,833 --> 01:08:01,545
finding Martinez's ticket out
of the queue, alright.

1232
01:08:01,546 --> 01:08:02,887
And then someone came to the door.

1233
01:08:03,302 --> 01:08:04,203
That's when he hung up.

1234
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:06,023
Alright listen, 
whoever came to the door...

1235
01:08:06,213 --> 01:08:06,841
<i>that's your killer.</i>

1236
01:08:07,029 --> 01:08:08,419
Okay, you get me a copy of the tape.

1237
01:08:08,429 --> 01:08:09,619
<i>I'm gonna get it to you right away.</i>

1238
01:08:10,259 --> 01:08:12,221
How is it going with the case?
You getting somewhere?

1239
01:08:12,305 --> 01:08:14,299
<i>Yeah, uh... we did catch a break.</i>

1240
01:08:14,427 --> 01:08:16,424
We found a bullet casing in
the room from a .22.

1241
01:08:16,513 --> 01:08:19,558
That's good, Frank Levin owned a .22.
You'll find it registered to him.

1242
01:08:19,683 --> 01:08:21,242
<i>Yeah, we did. Yeah... but uh...</i>

1243
01:08:21,601 --> 01:08:22,874
<i>-It wasn't a Woodsman.</i>
-A what?

1244
01:08:23,429 --> 01:08:24,367
A Colt Woodsman.

1245
01:08:24,890 --> 01:08:26,233
It's an old antique job.

1246
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:27,895
<i>That's the gun that killed him.</i>

1247
01:09:21,167 --> 01:09:22,239
Morning, Mick.

1248
01:09:24,419 --> 01:09:26,415
It's too bad about Frank Levin.

1249
01:09:26,504 --> 01:09:27,679
Got any idea who did it?

1250
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:29,225
Yeah, I'm pretty certain I do.

1251
01:09:35,404 --> 01:09:36,131
Mr. Talbot.

1252
01:09:36,842 --> 01:09:38,850
You were with Ms. Campo on
the night of March 6th.

1253
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:42,978
Yupe. We went on a date
to the Association.

1254
01:09:43,908 --> 01:09:45,163
Then I took her back to her place.

1255
01:09:45,937 --> 01:09:46,751
For another date.

1256
01:09:46,761 --> 01:09:48,850
And, did you have sexual relations?

1257
01:09:49,170 --> 01:09:50,353
About four hundred bucks worth.

1258
01:09:51,327 --> 01:09:53,827
And she earned every single cent.

1259
01:09:53,836 --> 01:09:55,715
What time did you leave her apartment?

1260
01:09:55,835 --> 01:09:58,995
Oh, I don't know uh...
about 5 minutes before 10?

1261
01:09:59,128 --> 01:10:02,012
Did she say whether she
had another appointment?

1262
01:10:02,172 --> 01:10:05,057
Oh, no, no, she acted like
she was done for the night.

1263
01:10:05,175 --> 01:10:06,167
Objection, your honour.

1264
01:10:06,215 --> 01:10:08,352
I don't think Mr. Talbot's qualified
to interpret

1265
01:10:08,353 --> 01:10:09,420
Ms. Campo's thinking or plans.

1266
01:10:09,592 --> 01:10:11,347
I mean, she acted satisfied.

1267
01:10:11,467 --> 01:10:13,508
Sustained. Go on, Mr. Minton.

1268
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:15,636
When you left, Mr. Talbot,

1269
01:10:15,761 --> 01:10:17,599
what condition was she in?

1270
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:18,717
Was she hurt?

1271
01:10:18,764 --> 01:10:20,724
No, she was fine.

1272
01:10:22,496 --> 01:10:23,818
She did not look like this?

1273
01:10:24,061 --> 01:10:25,052
Man.

1274
01:10:26,224 --> 01:10:28,587
What kind of sick bastard
that did something like that?

1275
01:10:28,901 --> 01:10:30,397
Answer the question.

1276
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:32,783
No.

1277
01:10:33,863 --> 01:10:36,620
No, we made pleasurable
and consensual love.

1278
01:10:37,214 --> 01:10:38,958
I mean that's what life's
all about, right?

1279
01:10:40,548 --> 01:10:41,497
That I paid her.

1280
01:10:42,214 --> 01:10:43,802
Mr. Talbot, are you a right handed?

1281
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:45,568
Or left handed?

1282
01:10:46,669 --> 01:10:47,316
Left.

1283
01:10:47,828 --> 01:10:49,155
-Left?
-Yeah.

1284
01:10:49,465 --> 01:10:52,447
Isn't it true that before you left
Ms. Campo's apartment...

1285
01:10:52,631 --> 01:10:56,112
She asked you to repeatedly strike
her in the face with your left fist?

1286
01:10:56,339 --> 01:10:58,349
Your honour, Mr. Haller's
just muddying

1287
01:10:58,350 --> 01:11:00,158
the water with outrageous statements.

1288
01:11:00,365 --> 01:11:01,803
Part of the defense theory,
your honour.

1289
01:11:02,052 --> 01:11:03,231
The witness can answer.

1290
01:11:04,618 --> 01:11:05,725
I'm sorry.

1291
01:11:06,192 --> 01:11:07,280
Can you repeat the question?

1292
01:11:07,743 --> 01:11:09,940
This is by your hand, isn't it,
Mr. Talbot?

1293
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:12,652
Admit it, this whole thing
is a set-up.

1294
01:11:12,881 --> 01:11:14,274
By you and Ms. Campo.

1295
01:11:14,554 --> 01:11:16,549
Framing my client,
Louis Roulet, isn't it?

1296
01:11:16,737 --> 01:11:19,266
I never hit her. Or any other woman,
you understand?

1297
01:11:19,528 --> 01:11:21,618
Do you know a prostitute named
Shaquille Barton?

1298
01:11:23,377 --> 01:11:25,419
Working name is uh...
Shaquilla Shackles?

1299
01:11:26,684 --> 01:11:27,900
Yeah, yeah, I seen her once.

1300
01:11:28,144 --> 01:11:31,079
And if I brought her in here,
and she say 'Yes, Mr. Talbot,

1301
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:32,603
he... he did strike me'.

1302
01:11:33,219 --> 01:11:35,883
-With his left fist, in my face?
-She'd be lying.

1303
01:11:35,965 --> 01:11:37,882
I tried Shaquilla once.

1304
01:11:37,966 --> 01:11:39,925
I'm not into that rough stuff.

1305
01:11:40,008 --> 01:11:41,382
I'm a missionary man.

1306
01:11:44,049 --> 01:11:45,208
With a strong left.

1307
01:11:45,304 --> 01:11:46,827
Am I on trial here?

1308
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:48,801
Not yet.

1309
01:12:03,165 --> 01:12:05,158
Good afternoon, detectives.

1310
01:12:05,246 --> 01:12:06,238
What can I do for you?

1311
01:12:11,984 --> 01:12:13,194
This warrant is bullshit.

1312
01:12:13,808 --> 01:12:15,685
Well, it's good enough
to search your house.

1313
01:12:16,778 --> 01:12:19,643
It would've been smart if you'd
told me that you had a Woodsman?

1314
01:12:20,373 --> 01:12:22,070
There's one registered to you.

1315
01:12:24,307 --> 01:12:25,426
Let's go for a drive.

1316
01:12:38,013 --> 01:12:39,002
Alright.

1317
01:12:39,051 --> 01:12:40,931
Let's bag the box.

1318
01:12:41,009 --> 01:12:43,126
Can't do ballistics on a box, can you?

1319
01:12:43,785 --> 01:12:45,082
Modern technology.

1320
01:12:45,290 --> 01:12:48,330
So uh, why didn't you
report this stolen?

1321
01:12:48,496 --> 01:12:50,330
I don't know.

1322
01:12:50,412 --> 01:12:51,401
Maybe I should have.

1323
01:12:51,491 --> 01:12:52,560
You think?

1324
01:12:52,613 --> 01:12:55,449
Still and all, we're gonna have
a look around the place, huh?

1325
01:12:55,609 --> 01:12:57,568
Go crazy. You got the warrant.

1326
01:12:57,647 --> 01:12:59,638
Alright, start with the couch.

1327
01:12:59,933 --> 01:13:00,925
Sir?

1328
01:13:00,975 --> 01:13:02,729
Stand up.

1329
01:13:04,054 --> 01:13:05,965
Hey, you know,
we got a history on the piece.

1330
01:13:06,175 --> 01:13:08,933
Turns out,
it once belonged to Micky Cowen,

1331
01:13:09,089 --> 01:13:10,205
the gangster from the '40s?

1332
01:13:10,253 --> 01:13:13,211
I know. My father,
he uh... represented him.

1333
01:13:13,329 --> 01:13:15,368
Got him off for using it
for self defence, so...

1334
01:13:15,451 --> 01:13:17,330
Micky made him the present of it.

1335
01:13:17,531 --> 01:13:18,521
Nice present.

1336
01:13:18,572 --> 01:13:20,530
Pearl handle, collectors' piece.

1337
01:13:20,652 --> 01:13:21,642
How sweet.

1338
01:13:21,735 --> 01:13:24,177
You know, that uh...
that Micky Cowen shooting...

1339
01:13:24,547 --> 01:13:25,844
It's... it's pretty famous.

1340
01:13:26,891 --> 01:13:29,773
It turns out that the county,
still has the evidence on storage.

1341
01:13:29,887 --> 01:13:30,679
The bullet.

1342
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:33,849
You can match the casing from
a slug that's 50 years old?

1343
01:13:34,046 --> 01:13:36,084
It would be easier with
the gun, but...

1344
01:13:36,209 --> 01:13:37,200
Yeah.

1345
01:13:40,412 --> 01:13:42,290
How long will ballistics take?

1346
01:13:55,267 --> 01:13:56,077
Hey, Mick.

1347
01:13:56,187 --> 01:13:57,221
I got something for you.

1348
01:13:58,345 --> 01:14:00,338
You asked me to find
out that witness' name.

1349
01:14:00,465 --> 01:14:01,454
Is it Corliss?

1350
01:14:01,507 --> 01:14:03,387
Dwayne Geoffrey Corliss. Right.

1351
01:14:03,586 --> 01:14:05,628
He's just low life type.
Not much came up.

1352
01:14:05,728 --> 01:14:07,734
But, sometimes he goes by DJ.

1353
01:14:08,168 --> 01:14:10,649
With punctuation! And when
you read it that way...

1354
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:11,767
tell me.

1355
01:14:11,815 --> 01:14:13,811
Well, he's played the
courtroom snitch a lot.

1356
01:14:13,897 --> 01:14:15,547
Here and in Arizona.

1357
01:14:15,682 --> 01:14:17,010
Both times,
they got him early release.

1358
01:14:17,719 --> 01:14:19,123
Alright, this could be good.

1359
01:14:20,093 --> 01:14:22,086
All I gotta do is find him.

1360
01:14:22,171 --> 01:14:24,163
They put him on a pre-trial
rehab at USC.

1361
01:14:31,232 --> 01:14:32,143
I just got lucky.

1362
01:14:39,759 --> 01:14:40,749
There she is.

1363
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:41,876
How are you, sweety?

1364
01:14:42,877 --> 01:14:43,867
You alright?

1365
01:14:44,043 --> 01:14:45,032
Alright, listen.

1366
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:47,119
I'm actually not in here about you.

1367
01:14:48,075 --> 01:14:50,066
I need you to do something for me.

1368
01:14:50,321 --> 01:14:51,231
Keep moving!

1369
01:14:51,401 --> 01:14:53,199
Let's go, let's go!

1370
01:14:54,479 --> 01:14:56,470
Stay on the wall, all the way down!

1371
01:14:56,555 --> 01:14:58,355
That's the bucks, boys, let's go.

1372
01:15:02,713 --> 01:15:03,747
Stay on the line.

1373
01:15:04,789 --> 01:15:05,825
Corliss, right?

1374
01:15:08,948 --> 01:15:10,939
I only came to say what is required.

1375
01:15:12,190 --> 01:15:14,183
Rusky! Ready for the line!

1376
01:15:16,139 --> 01:15:17,129
You don't know me.

1377
01:15:18,343 --> 01:15:19,333
You talk to the DA...

1378
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:22,256
he can get a way
to get both of us out.

1379
01:15:23,498 --> 01:15:24,487
Step through!

1380
01:15:31,774 --> 01:15:34,689
So, Haller, you had an
interesting visitor last night.

1381
01:15:35,017 --> 01:15:36,894
Worry about yourself, Ted.

1382
01:15:37,094 --> 01:15:39,801
You're dying the death
of a thousand razors

1383
01:15:39,802 --> 01:15:41,426
up there and you don't even know it.

1384
01:15:52,562 --> 01:15:53,598
One last witness, your honour.

1385
01:15:53,685 --> 01:15:55,642
The prosecution calls Regina Campo.

1386
01:15:55,807 --> 01:15:58,688
It's true that I uh...
lied to the police.

1387
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:01,798
I knew the defendant
when he came to the door.

1388
01:16:01,877 --> 01:16:03,070
Ms. Campo...

1389
01:16:03,121 --> 01:16:04,922
why did you lie?

1390
01:16:06,078 --> 01:16:07,148
Because I'm scared.

1391
01:16:08,282 --> 01:16:10,272
I didn't think the
police would believe me...

1392
01:16:10,357 --> 01:16:12,057
and I wanted to make sure
they arrested him.

1393
01:16:12,438 --> 01:16:14,078
'Cos he's an animal.

1394
01:16:15,390 --> 01:16:17,542
-Do you regret your decision now?
-Yes.

1395
01:16:17,637 --> 01:16:20,437
If it helps him get free
and do this to somebody else.

1396
01:16:20,795 --> 01:16:23,339
Objection!
That's prejudiciary, your honour.

1397
01:16:23,468 --> 01:16:24,218
Sustained.

1398
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:27,193
I have no further
questions for Ms. Campo.

1399
01:16:27,865 --> 01:16:29,296
Your witness, Mr. Haller.

1400
01:16:30,085 --> 01:16:30,643
Ms. Campo.

1401
01:16:31,308 --> 01:16:33,077
Have you engaged to an attorney?

1402
01:16:33,917 --> 01:16:36,560
To sue... Louis Roulet for the events

1403
01:16:36,561 --> 01:16:38,428
that happened on the eve of March 6th?

1404
01:16:38,711 --> 01:16:39,823
No, I haven't.

1405
01:16:40,211 --> 01:16:41,371
Have you talked to an attorney?

1406
01:16:41,951 --> 01:16:43,281
I haven't hired anyone.

1407
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:44,840
No, have you talked to one?

1408
01:16:45,581 --> 01:16:46,808
About a possible lawsuit?

1409
01:16:47,237 --> 01:16:48,511
It was nothing more than talk.

1410
01:16:50,216 --> 01:16:52,436
Did you ask him if you
could sue him for damages?

1411
01:16:55,433 --> 01:16:57,469
I thought what you say
to lawyers is private?

1412
01:16:57,846 --> 01:16:59,606
If you wish, you can tell the jurors.

1413
01:17:03,748 --> 01:17:05,116
I think I'd like to keep it private.

1414
01:17:06,638 --> 01:17:07,321
Good!

1415
01:17:08,762 --> 01:17:11,343
Let's talk about the night
at the Association bar.

1416
01:17:12,023 --> 01:17:14,127
Have you ever seen Louis Roulet
before that night?

1417
01:17:15,042 --> 01:17:17,177
Yes, there and other places.

1418
01:17:17,260 --> 01:17:19,218
Ever noticed that he wore
a rolex watch?

1419
01:17:19,807 --> 01:17:20,668
No.

1420
01:17:20,669 --> 01:17:22,746
Or that he drove one of 2 vehicles?

1421
01:17:23,022 --> 01:17:24,830
A Maserati and a Range Rover?

1422
01:17:25,578 --> 01:17:26,739
I never saw him driving.

1423
01:17:27,415 --> 01:17:28,769
And what made you approach him?

1424
01:17:28,778 --> 01:17:31,891
I saw him leave with girls uh...
who do what I do.

1425
01:17:31,938 --> 01:17:32,976
With prostitutes?

1426
01:17:34,058 --> 01:17:37,455
Then go to a hotel or one of
their apartments, right?

1427
01:17:37,791 --> 01:17:38,690
I don't know where.

1428
01:17:39,090 --> 01:17:40,159
Well, how do you know they left?

1429
01:17:40,211 --> 01:17:42,124
Maybe they just went out for a smoke?

1430
01:17:42,207 --> 01:17:44,200
Because, I saw them getting
in his car...

1431
01:17:44,330 --> 01:17:45,365
-and drive away.
-No, wait a minute.

1432
01:17:45,410 --> 01:17:49,325
You just testified that you
had never seen Mr. Roulet drive.

1433
01:17:49,523 --> 01:17:52,600
Now you're saying that yes, you did
see Mr. Roulet get in his car

1434
01:17:52,768 --> 01:17:54,762
and leave with a
prostitute like yourself?

1435
01:17:55,678 --> 01:17:56,747
Which one is it?

1436
01:17:56,800 --> 01:18:00,685
I saw him get in his car, but I
didn't know what kind of car it was.

1437
01:18:00,878 --> 01:18:02,995
You know the difference between
a Maserati and a Range Rover?

1438
01:18:03,082 --> 01:18:05,996
One is small, one is big, I guess.

1439
01:18:06,199 --> 01:18:07,189
Okay.

1440
01:18:10,441 --> 01:18:12,239
The other women.

1441
01:18:13,475 --> 01:18:15,466
Had left with Louis.

1442
01:18:15,552 --> 01:18:16,623
When you saw them again...

1443
01:18:16,676 --> 01:18:20,086
did any of them ever have
injuries or any of them beaten?

1444
01:18:20,521 --> 01:18:21,632
I don't know, I didn't ask.

1445
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:24,712
But girls in your profession,
you do talk to each other...

1446
01:18:24,868 --> 01:18:26,745
about customers, right?

1447
01:18:27,073 --> 01:18:29,952
You warned each other...
if someone's a freak or something?

1448
01:18:30,063 --> 01:18:31,979
Yeah, usually.

1449
01:18:32,102 --> 01:18:34,152
And did any of them
ever warned you or have

1450
01:18:34,153 --> 01:18:36,062
one bad thing to say about
Louis Roulet?

1451
01:18:36,219 --> 01:18:37,208
No.

1452
01:18:38,299 --> 01:18:39,289
No one.

1453
01:18:39,339 --> 01:18:41,457
So you believed you'd be safe?

1454
01:18:41,582 --> 01:18:45,543
I thought he was a known quantity
and I needed the money, so...

1455
01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:48,701
So you thought, he could
solve your problems with money?

1456
01:18:48,816 --> 01:18:49,885
-No!
-No?

1457
01:18:49,940 --> 01:18:51,821
Isn't that why you're sitting here?

1458
01:18:51,936 --> 01:18:53,849
Because you zeroed in on him.

1459
01:18:53,935 --> 01:18:54,925
No!

1460
01:18:55,013 --> 01:18:57,927
I mean, yes, but it wasn't like that.

1461
01:18:59,211 --> 01:19:01,205
He attacked me. I swear.

1462
01:19:07,445 --> 01:19:10,407
And... alright,
let's pause that right there.

1463
01:19:12,602 --> 01:19:15,641
Just to confirm... this is you?

1464
01:19:15,803 --> 01:19:16,715
Right, Ms. Campo?

1465
01:19:16,842 --> 01:19:17,831
Yes.

1466
01:19:18,006 --> 01:19:19,840
What was on the napkin?

1467
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:22,918
My name and address.

1468
01:19:23,541 --> 01:19:24,906
And your price?

1469
01:19:26,092 --> 01:19:27,783
Yes, $400.

1470
01:19:28,775 --> 01:19:29,853
It's a hard line of work.

1471
01:19:30,404 --> 01:19:31,981
Yes, and dangerous.

1472
01:19:32,614 --> 01:19:34,525
In fact, haven't you told
your friends many times...

1473
01:19:35,014 --> 01:19:36,373
that you were looking for a way out?

1474
01:19:37,591 --> 01:19:39,585
I'm not proud of what I do.

1475
01:19:39,670 --> 01:19:40,737
I know.

1476
01:19:40,791 --> 01:19:41,981
And isn't it true...

1477
01:19:42,503 --> 01:19:44,628
and nothing will be
easier to understand...

1478
01:19:46,522 --> 01:19:49,467
that you saw Louis Roulet
and his money as that way out?

1479
01:19:49,470 --> 01:19:51,320
No! That's not what this is about!

1480
01:19:53,890 --> 01:19:55,101
Are you not listening to me?

1481
01:19:56,267 --> 01:19:57,695
No further questions, your honour.

1482
01:19:58,033 --> 01:19:58,787
Mr. Minton.

1483
01:19:59,585 --> 01:20:01,261
Do you have another witness for us?

1484
01:20:03,417 --> 01:20:04,530
Minton looks worried.

1485
01:20:06,860 --> 01:20:08,692
Not worried enough.

1486
01:20:11,018 --> 01:20:12,009
No.

1487
01:20:12,060 --> 01:20:13,939
The state rests, your honour.

1488
01:20:14,055 --> 01:20:17,049
Then the defense will call
its first witness after lunch.

1489
01:20:19,296 --> 01:20:22,095
Yes, I recognise this knife.

1490
01:20:22,246 --> 01:20:25,366
It's the one that my son has
carried with him for protection.

1491
01:20:25,491 --> 01:20:27,528
For the last 4 years, almost exactly.

1492
01:20:28,482 --> 01:20:29,571
Why would he need protection?

1493
01:20:30,882 --> 01:20:34,596
Realtors alone in the house
are sometimes robbed or...

1494
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:35,993
hurt...

1495
01:20:36,838 --> 01:20:37,875
and raped or murdered.

1496
01:20:39,043 --> 01:20:41,880
Has Louis ever been
the subject to such crime?

1497
01:20:42,204 --> 01:20:43,194
Oh no.

1498
01:20:44,201 --> 01:20:45,271
But he knew someone who was.

1499
01:20:45,324 --> 01:20:48,123
Raped and robbed by a man.

1500
01:20:49,272 --> 01:20:50,390
Louis found her.

1501
01:20:51,435 --> 01:20:52,313
It was terrible.

1502
01:20:53,472 --> 01:20:56,386
So, the first thing he did afterwards,
was getting himself a knife.

1503
01:20:56,673 --> 01:20:58,552
To carry it with him at all times.

1504
01:20:59,707 --> 01:21:00,664
Thank you, Ms. Windsor.

1505
01:21:00,832 --> 01:21:02,664
I have no further questions,
your honour.

1506
01:21:02,951 --> 01:21:03,990
Your witness, Mr. Minton.

1507
01:21:04,945 --> 01:21:05,936
Ms. Windsor.

1508
01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:09,034
You seemed pretty exact
about when it was your son

1509
01:21:09,035 --> 01:21:10,991
started carrying around this...

1510
01:21:12,183 --> 01:21:13,173
this weapon.

1511
01:21:13,222 --> 01:21:17,138
-A five inch folding knife.
-Yes, I am.

1512
01:21:17,464 --> 01:21:21,301
The incident took
place on June 9th, 2007.

1513
01:21:21,663 --> 01:21:23,496
Was it in the newspapers?

1514
01:21:26,695 --> 01:21:27,811
Do you somehow remember it because...

1515
01:21:27,899 --> 01:21:29,892
the police came to talk to Louis?

1516
01:21:30,852 --> 01:21:32,845
No, there was no police investigation.

1517
01:21:32,972 --> 01:21:35,089
Then, how do you
remember the exact date?

1518
01:21:35,174 --> 01:21:38,089
Were you given it before
your testimony here today?

1519
01:21:39,251 --> 01:21:40,288
I remember the date because...

1520
01:21:40,333 --> 01:21:43,166
I'll never forget the date
I was attacked.

1521
01:21:43,490 --> 01:21:45,482
And Louis won't forget it either.

1522
01:21:46,485 --> 01:21:48,477
He found me in the house tied up.

1523
01:21:48,730 --> 01:21:50,565
My clothes were ripped.

1524
01:21:53,928 --> 01:21:55,760
It was traumatic for him.

1525
01:22:02,116 --> 01:22:03,107
Mr. Minton?

1526
01:22:03,156 --> 01:22:05,151
Is there anything else
you wish to ask?

1527
01:22:09,409 --> 01:22:10,148
No, your honour.

1528
01:22:21,663 --> 01:22:23,629
I've been thinking about those
thousand razors?

1529
01:22:32,391 --> 01:22:33,265
We've had an offer.

1530
01:22:34,594 --> 01:22:36,225
You spend 6 months in the county jail.

1531
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:38,946
Like I told you from the beginning.

1532
01:22:39,115 --> 01:22:41,850
No deals, no bargaining, I'm innocent.

1533
01:22:41,851 --> 01:22:44,383
Save it. You make the call.
I don't give a shit.

1534
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:47,189
-You got my answer.
-Yes, I do.

1535
01:22:47,367 --> 01:22:48,488
I'll pass it along.

1536
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:49,569
You do that.

1537
01:22:49,870 --> 01:22:50,494
Oh, Louis.

1538
01:22:53,591 --> 01:22:54,581
Tomorrow...

1539
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:57,410
I'm putting you on the stand.

1540
01:22:59,380 --> 01:23:00,070
I'm ready.

1541
01:23:00,237 --> 01:23:01,011
Oh, you'd better be.

1542
01:23:13,014 --> 01:23:13,588
Hey, Earl.

1543
01:23:17,004 --> 01:23:19,197
There's something,
I need you to get for me.

1544
01:23:22,869 --> 01:23:25,783
Your honour, the defense
calls Louis Ross Roulet.

1545
01:23:27,042 --> 01:23:29,899
I knocked uh... she looked
through her side window...

1546
01:23:29,900 --> 01:23:30,911
and saw that it was me.

1547
01:23:31,069 --> 01:23:31,988
And opened the door.

1548
01:23:32,306 --> 01:23:35,698
Then, I walked pass her towards
the living room.

1549
01:23:36,317 --> 01:23:37,387
What happened next?

1550
01:23:37,488 --> 01:23:39,319
Something hit me from behind.

1551
01:23:39,534 --> 01:23:40,570
I blacked out.

1552
01:23:41,580 --> 01:23:43,205
I have no idea for how long.

1553
01:23:43,610 --> 01:23:45,723
-Is that all?
-When I woke up, uh...

1554
01:23:45,994 --> 01:23:47,549
Two guys were sitting on me.

1555
01:23:47,846 --> 01:23:49,152
Telling me not to move.

1556
01:23:50,740 --> 01:23:51,674
I couldn't anyway. I was...

1557
01:23:52,708 --> 01:23:53,340
I was scared.

1558
01:23:54,235 --> 01:23:55,522
But you had blood on your sweater.

1559
01:23:56,713 --> 01:23:57,720
And on your left hand.

1560
01:23:58,260 --> 01:24:00,189
Someone put it there because I didn't.

1561
01:24:00,457 --> 01:24:02,492
You didn't strike Ms.Campo
with your left fist?

1562
01:24:02,493 --> 01:24:03,070
No.

1563
01:24:03,108 --> 01:24:04,352
-Threatened to rape her?
-No...

1564
01:24:04,353 --> 01:24:06,218
-threatened to kill her?
-No! I am not that guy!

1565
01:24:06,858 --> 01:24:07,108
I...

1566
01:24:08,955 --> 01:24:10,769
Do you have any idea what it's like...

1567
01:24:10,770 --> 01:24:12,448
to be accused of something like this?

1568
01:24:13,006 --> 01:24:15,785
To sit there...
and listen to people tell lies?

1569
01:24:16,101 --> 01:24:19,635
About you? About you having done
something this sick and depraved?

1570
01:24:20,797 --> 01:24:21,917
Call you an animal?

1571
01:24:22,401 --> 01:24:24,384
Talk about your sex life,
humiliate you?

1572
01:24:25,790 --> 01:24:28,589
Listen, I understand the process.
I know I had to sit there...

1573
01:24:29,208 --> 01:24:30,257
and better be qulet.

1574
01:24:30,639 --> 01:24:31,630
And wait my chance.

1575
01:24:32,116 --> 01:24:35,190
But if guilty people have rights,
then what about innocent people?

1576
01:24:37,263 --> 01:24:39,015
I am innocent.

1577
01:24:41,675 --> 01:24:45,000
I'm innocent and
I want this behind me.

1578
01:24:46,857 --> 01:24:48,390
I have no further questions,
your honour.

1579
01:24:49,780 --> 01:24:50,508
According to you...

1580
01:24:51,314 --> 01:24:53,922
Ms. Campo... punched...

1581
01:24:54,702 --> 01:24:55,649
herself?

1582
01:24:56,105 --> 01:24:58,261
Or she had...
someone she had never met.

1583
01:24:58,685 --> 01:25:02,622
Violently and visciously beat
her as a part of a set up?

1584
01:25:02,670 --> 01:25:04,079
All I know is that I didn't.

1585
01:25:04,483 --> 01:25:06,622
And this knife that you always carry..

1586
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:10,066
How did she know she'd find it
on you as part of the set up?

1587
01:25:10,237 --> 01:25:11,475
Guess she couldn't. Could she?

1588
01:25:13,012 --> 01:25:14,007
I never take it out.

1589
01:25:14,283 --> 01:25:15,390
I never show it to anyone...

1590
01:25:15,470 --> 01:25:18,205
So, she must have just found
it in my pocket after...

1591
01:25:18,810 --> 01:25:20,631
she or whoever knocked me out.

1592
01:25:21,461 --> 01:25:22,076
Isn't that right?

1593
01:25:22,302 --> 01:25:24,669
I would prefer if I ask the questions.

1594
01:25:25,606 --> 01:25:26,364
Okay.

1595
01:25:27,628 --> 01:25:29,747
Mr. Roulet, I'd like you to take uh...

1596
01:25:31,154 --> 01:25:32,329
Take a look at this photo.

1597
01:25:33,304 --> 01:25:34,051
Tell me again.

1598
01:25:34,705 --> 01:25:37,916
Do you think,
Regina Campo would or could...

1599
01:25:38,409 --> 01:25:40,732
have done this to herself?

1600
01:25:41,611 --> 01:25:42,727
I don't know who did it.

1601
01:25:43,660 --> 01:25:44,489
But it wasn't me.

1602
01:25:45,047 --> 01:25:46,535
Nobody deserves that to happen.

1603
01:25:46,917 --> 01:25:49,797
What do you mean by 'deserves'?

1604
01:25:51,136 --> 01:25:54,049
Do you mean... crimes of violence...

1605
01:25:54,223 --> 01:25:57,586
only comes down to a woman
getting what she deserves?

1606
01:25:57,596 --> 01:26:00,161
I mean, no matter what she does...

1607
01:26:00,261 --> 01:26:01,520
or who she is.

1608
01:26:02,441 --> 01:26:04,131
No woman deserves that.

1609
01:26:06,444 --> 01:26:07,819
I have nothing further, your honour.

1610
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:11,525
Mr. Roulet, you're excused.

1611
01:26:12,464 --> 01:26:13,346
Thank you.

1612
01:26:15,192 --> 01:26:16,482
The defense rests, your honour.

1613
01:26:31,730 --> 01:26:33,054
Before deciding to rest this case,

1614
01:26:33,055 --> 01:26:34,659
the state would like to take
the night, your honour.

1615
01:26:35,501 --> 01:26:36,328
For what purpose?

1616
01:26:37,108 --> 01:26:38,565
To consider a rebuttal witness.

1617
01:26:40,536 --> 01:26:41,799
What witness is he talking about?

1618
01:26:42,529 --> 01:26:43,552
I have no idea.

1619
01:26:44,807 --> 01:26:46,725
The court will adjourn
'til 10 o'clock tomorrow.

1620
01:27:07,900 --> 01:27:09,436
-Morning, Bill.
-Morning.

1621
01:27:09,447 --> 01:27:11,312
I'm gonna go grab some coffee.
You want some?

1622
01:27:11,450 --> 01:27:12,956
No, man, I'm off caffeine.

1623
01:27:13,046 --> 01:27:15,184
Right, is that the custody list?

1624
01:27:15,420 --> 01:27:15,924
Yeah.

1625
01:27:15,934 --> 01:27:17,945
Let me see if any of my no
good clients are on there.

1626
01:27:17,955 --> 01:27:18,789
Sure.

1627
01:27:23,698 --> 01:27:24,696
<b>Corliss, Dwayne.</b>

1628
01:27:25,152 --> 01:27:28,730
Lorna, Minton's putting Corliss on.

1629
01:27:28,882 --> 01:27:30,431
-He's already in lock-up.
-But that is great!

1630
01:27:30,432 --> 01:27:33,174
Yeah, it's good. How did it
go with you? You served Kurlen?

1631
01:27:33,295 --> 01:27:34,363
-Yes, I did.
-Okay.

1632
01:27:34,505 --> 01:27:36,339
I'm going back to the court now.

1633
01:27:36,468 --> 01:27:37,460
Stand by.

1634
01:27:37,553 --> 01:27:38,542
Okay.

1635
01:27:41,570 --> 01:27:44,077
Hey, Haller, what is this bullshit?

1636
01:27:44,337 --> 01:27:45,735
I have nothing to do with this case.

1637
01:27:45,866 --> 01:27:47,936
Subpoena to appear as a witness.

1638
01:27:48,997 --> 01:27:50,066
You'll just have to wait and see.

1639
01:27:51,084 --> 01:27:52,200
It's a legal document, detective.

1640
01:28:09,909 --> 01:28:10,749
Hey.

1641
01:28:11,189 --> 01:28:12,154
Glad you made it.

1642
01:28:12,566 --> 01:28:15,666
-Is he looking romantic?
-Ever so especially.

1643
01:28:16,796 --> 01:28:17,555
See you later.

1644
01:28:24,143 --> 01:28:25,051
Mr. Minton.

1645
01:28:25,582 --> 01:28:26,983
Does the state have any rebuttal?

1646
01:28:29,803 --> 01:28:32,462
The state intends to call
Dwayne Geoffrey Corliss,

1647
01:28:32,803 --> 01:28:33,979
as a rebuttal witness, your honour.

1648
01:28:34,214 --> 01:28:35,602
Judge, who is this witness?

1649
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:38,333
And why wasn't I told about
him until now?

1650
01:28:38,993 --> 01:28:39,691
Bailiff?

1651
01:28:39,992 --> 01:28:40,736
Remove the jury.

1652
01:28:47,636 --> 01:28:48,834
A fair question.

1653
01:28:49,641 --> 01:28:50,631
Mr. Minton?

1654
01:28:50,685 --> 01:28:52,378
Dwayne Corliss is
a co-operating witness

1655
01:28:52,379 --> 01:28:54,556
who spoke with Mr. Roulet in custody,

1656
01:28:54,558 --> 01:28:55,441
following arrest.

1657
01:28:55,442 --> 01:28:56,890
That's a lie!
I didn't speak to anyone!

1658
01:28:56,990 --> 01:28:58,028
Qulet, Mr. Roulet!

1659
01:28:58,953 --> 01:29:00,095
Mr. Haller, control your client.

1660
01:29:00,122 --> 01:29:02,001
Let me take it from here.

1661
01:29:02,128 --> 01:29:04,120
Judge, I share my client's outrage.

1662
01:29:04,341 --> 01:29:07,256
How long has the state been
sitting on this testimony?

1663
01:29:07,435 --> 01:29:09,479
Mr. Corliss just came forward
yesterday, your honour.

1664
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:10,184
Yesterday?

1665
01:29:11,530 --> 01:29:12,361
This is incredible.

1666
01:29:13,010 --> 01:29:14,534
Do you want to go back
and talk to him?

1667
01:29:14,783 --> 01:29:16,329
Given the time, I'd allow it.

1668
01:29:16,502 --> 01:29:18,816
No, thank you, though, judge.

1669
01:29:18,824 --> 01:29:19,932
I think we all know what this is.

1670
01:29:20,244 --> 01:29:23,027
Mr. Minton's putting
a jailhouse snitch on the stand.

1671
01:29:23,103 --> 01:29:24,880
And everything he says will be a lie.

1672
01:29:24,900 --> 01:29:27,514
-That's groundless, your honour.
-I want my objection noted.

1673
01:29:28,549 --> 01:29:29,682
Then, I'm going to rule.

1674
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:31,513
He can testify.

1675
01:29:32,439 --> 01:29:33,474
Call the jury in.

1676
01:29:33,570 --> 01:29:35,641
May I ask one indulgence, your honour?

1677
01:29:35,784 --> 01:29:37,263
May I step into the hallway and...

1678
01:29:37,264 --> 01:29:38,870
make a call to an investigator for

1679
01:29:38,871 --> 01:29:40,464
whatever good it may do
at this late date?

1680
01:29:41,513 --> 01:29:42,667
Thank you, your honour.

1681
01:29:51,330 --> 01:29:52,366
<i>Yupe, I'm here.</i>

1682
01:29:53,379 --> 01:29:56,418
Come into the court house at
exactly 10:15 with the printouts.

1683
01:30:00,816 --> 01:30:01,807
Mr. Corliss.

1684
01:30:02,868 --> 01:30:04,780
Are you incarcerated at this time?

1685
01:30:04,915 --> 01:30:06,829
Um...

1686
01:30:07,046 --> 01:30:09,039
No, now, I'm just in the courtroom.

1687
01:30:12,394 --> 01:30:16,311
But you are currently being held in
a jail ward at USC hospital, correct?

1688
01:30:16,536 --> 01:30:19,371
Yeah, since I got arrested.

1689
01:30:19,501 --> 01:30:21,696
For burglary and drug possession?

1690
01:30:22,580 --> 01:30:23,598
That's right.

1691
01:30:24,768 --> 01:30:26,760
Now...

1692
01:30:27,903 --> 01:30:28,973
do you know the defendant?

1693
01:30:30,993 --> 01:30:31,985
Yeah.

1694
01:30:32,164 --> 01:30:33,234
I met him in lock-up.

1695
01:30:33,293 --> 01:30:35,207
We've had a stopover from jail.

1696
01:30:36,304 --> 01:30:38,731
Then we were together in the tank,
when we came for first appearances.

1697
01:30:39,090 --> 01:30:39,851
Did you talk at that time?

1698
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:41,430
Yeah.

1699
01:30:41,654 --> 01:30:43,644
Talk about how bad are the cigarettes.

1700
01:30:44,620 --> 01:30:45,656
Anything else?

1701
01:30:45,705 --> 01:30:47,822
Uh... you know... what are you in for?

1702
01:30:48,882 --> 01:30:49,873
Like that.

1703
01:30:50,008 --> 01:30:52,890
And... did he say what he was in for?

1704
01:30:53,147 --> 01:30:56,108
He said, for giving a bitch
exactly what she deserved.

1705
01:30:57,326 --> 01:30:59,123
Those were his words.

1706
01:30:59,205 --> 01:31:03,360
For giving a bitch
exactly what she deserved.

1707
01:31:04,596 --> 01:31:07,080
Now... have I or anyone
else promised you

1708
01:31:07,081 --> 01:31:08,884
anything in exchange for
your testimony today?

1709
01:31:09,108 --> 01:31:09,630
No.

1710
01:31:10,780 --> 01:31:11,849
Just the right thing to do.

1711
01:31:13,568 --> 01:31:14,321
Thank you, your honour.

1712
01:31:30,650 --> 01:31:33,750
How many times, have you
been arrested, Mr. Corliss?

1713
01:31:35,350 --> 01:31:36,884
About 7 times in L.A.

1714
01:31:37,763 --> 01:31:38,760
Couple more in Phoenix.

1715
01:31:38,761 --> 01:31:40,550
And New York,
if you wanna count those.

1716
01:31:40,572 --> 01:31:42,641
Yeah, so you know how the
system works, I would say.

1717
01:31:43,660 --> 01:31:44,694
I tried to survive.

1718
01:31:45,872 --> 01:31:47,864
Does that sometimes mean
ratting out fellow inmates?

1719
01:31:47,963 --> 01:31:49,795
Your honour, I object.

1720
01:31:49,926 --> 01:31:51,042
Take a seat, Mr. Minton.

1721
01:31:51,095 --> 01:31:53,051
I gave you leeway for
bringing this witness in.

1722
01:31:53,141 --> 01:31:54,175
Thank you, your honour.

1723
01:31:54,266 --> 01:31:55,304
But I'll rephrase.

1724
01:31:56,233 --> 01:31:58,305
What I'm asking you, is how
many times have you snitched...

1725
01:31:58,445 --> 01:32:00,277
on a fellow inmate?

1726
01:32:00,368 --> 01:32:02,439
-This makes me four.
-This makes your fourth time?

1727
01:32:02,579 --> 01:32:04,489
Four times you've testified?

1728
01:32:04,582 --> 01:32:07,543
For the prosecution?
Against a fellow inmate?

1729
01:32:08,679 --> 01:32:10,671
Makes you a popular man, Mr. Corliss.

1730
01:32:10,808 --> 01:32:11,923
Sounds like people just
come up to you...

1731
01:32:11,977 --> 01:32:13,933
and they tell you the
crimes they've committed...

1732
01:32:14,021 --> 01:32:15,898
so you can come in here and
testify against them.

1733
01:32:16,111 --> 01:32:18,147
People talk to me. I'm a friendly guy.

1734
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:19,309
You're a friendly guy?

1735
01:32:19,370 --> 01:32:22,203
And you're saying you and
my client were friends?

1736
01:32:22,333 --> 01:32:23,369
Louis Roulet?

1737
01:32:23,462 --> 01:32:25,453
So he just said to you...

1738
01:32:25,550 --> 01:32:27,505
what you just told us and
told the jury that...

1739
01:32:27,639 --> 01:32:30,597
that he gave a woman
what she deserved?

1740
01:32:30,769 --> 01:32:33,376
And then the two of you are
back to talking about cigarettes?

1741
01:32:33,923 --> 01:32:34,843
Not exactly.

1742
01:32:34,989 --> 01:32:36,822
It's like he was braggin'.

1743
01:32:37,998 --> 01:32:39,197
Told me he did it before.

1744
01:32:40,252 --> 01:32:42,082
He said the other time,
he killed the bitch.

1745
01:32:42,255 --> 01:32:44,088
Got away with it then.

1746
01:32:44,220 --> 01:32:45,209
Can get away with it now.

1747
01:32:49,387 --> 01:32:49,829
Mr. Haller?

1748
01:32:56,350 --> 01:32:57,624
I have no more questions, your honour.

1749
01:32:59,963 --> 01:33:01,479
Redirect, your honour.

1750
01:33:07,189 --> 01:33:09,147
-What the hell is this?
-You tell me.

1751
01:33:09,238 --> 01:33:10,744
What the hell did you say to
this guy, huh?

1752
01:33:11,036 --> 01:33:12,480
Nothing. This is a set-up.

1753
01:33:12,577 --> 01:33:14,710
-And you're doing this.
-How?

1754
01:33:15,625 --> 01:33:17,092
How am I doing this?

1755
01:33:17,670 --> 01:33:18,658
Huh?

1756
01:33:19,886 --> 01:33:21,841
You said he was bragging.

1757
01:33:21,972 --> 01:33:23,928
-How?
-Well...

1758
01:33:24,020 --> 01:33:25,055
Like he told me the details.

1759
01:33:25,146 --> 01:33:26,979
Of the other one.

1760
01:33:27,068 --> 01:33:28,104
That he killed.

1761
01:33:30,202 --> 01:33:32,192
She was a... dancer...

1762
01:33:32,290 --> 01:33:33,281
at some club.

1763
01:33:34,380 --> 01:33:35,529
And she had...

1764
01:33:35,590 --> 01:33:38,342
sexy snake tattoo
wrapped around her body.

1765
01:33:41,772 --> 01:33:43,603
Did he say anything else?

1766
01:33:43,943 --> 01:33:44,933
Hm... no.

1767
01:33:45,905 --> 01:33:46,894
No.

1768
01:33:47,992 --> 01:33:49,063
Snake girl stuff was it.

1769
01:33:52,297 --> 01:33:54,176
How does he know this, Louis?

1770
01:33:54,819 --> 01:33:55,934
You think I know?

1771
01:33:56,347 --> 01:33:58,342
No! If you didn't tell him that shit,
somebody did.

1772
01:34:00,115 --> 01:34:01,802
Better start thinking
about who that could be.

1773
01:34:02,558 --> 01:34:04,130
Then I have no further questions,
your honour.

1774
01:34:06,415 --> 01:34:07,872
Any re-crossed from the defense?

1775
01:34:13,908 --> 01:34:15,687
-A moment with my staff, your honour.
-Be quick.

1776
01:34:17,515 --> 01:34:18,582
-Hey!
-Is it all here?

1777
01:34:18,868 --> 01:34:20,383
-Yeah.
-Okay, good.

1778
01:34:21,086 --> 01:34:22,728
Listen, if you go on now,
leave the building.

1779
01:34:22,729 --> 01:34:24,656
I don't want anyone asking
you questions, you got it?

1780
01:34:24,657 --> 01:34:25,521
-Okay.
-Alright.

1781
01:34:27,626 --> 01:34:28,662
Dwayne.

1782
01:34:28,713 --> 01:34:29,783
Mind if I call you that?

1783
01:34:29,883 --> 01:34:30,873
Sure, man.

1784
01:34:30,927 --> 01:34:33,682
Wow on the assistant.

1785
01:34:34,893 --> 01:34:36,089
You're a funny guy, DJ.

1786
01:34:38,236 --> 01:34:39,224
DJ.

1787
01:34:40,159 --> 01:34:41,274
Isn't that what they call you uh...

1788
01:34:41,330 --> 01:34:43,319
for example, down in Phoenix?

1789
01:34:44,293 --> 01:34:45,282
Maybe.

1790
01:34:45,463 --> 01:34:48,155
And my assistant,
one whose numbers you want...

1791
01:34:48,650 --> 01:34:49,747
she was reading on a uh...

1792
01:34:50,725 --> 01:34:52,565
on the internet about a DJ Corliss.

1793
01:34:52,728 --> 01:34:57,183
Arrested in 1989 on drug charges,
hometown Imesa, Arizona?

1794
01:34:57,800 --> 01:34:59,071
Oh yeah, that'd be me.

1795
01:34:59,077 --> 01:35:00,638
Do you remember Fred Bentley, right?

1796
01:35:01,038 --> 01:35:03,028
Uh... your honour...

1797
01:35:03,126 --> 01:35:04,665
where's the defense going with this?

1798
01:35:05,259 --> 01:35:06,875
Make a connection soon, Mr. Haller.

1799
01:35:07,348 --> 01:35:08,915
But the witness will answer.

1800
01:35:10,024 --> 01:35:12,084
-I don't remember any Bentley.
-Sure you do.

1801
01:35:12,566 --> 01:35:14,698
You testified that
he confessed to you...

1802
01:35:14,780 --> 01:35:16,187
the crime that he was charged with.

1803
01:35:16,784 --> 01:35:18,566
Raping a 10 year old girl.

1804
01:35:19,834 --> 01:35:21,301
But he denied it in court.

1805
01:35:22,923 --> 01:35:23,993
Are they ringing any bells?

1806
01:35:24,050 --> 01:35:25,041
DJ?

1807
01:35:26,099 --> 01:35:28,839
1989, I was high a lot.
I don't much recall...

1808
01:35:28,840 --> 01:35:29,986
I would like you to read this for us.

1809
01:35:31,319 --> 01:35:35,072
Your honour, this is a news
report from the Arizona Star 1997.

1810
01:35:35,096 --> 01:35:37,453
8 years after Mr. Bentley
was convicted.

1811
01:35:37,666 --> 01:35:39,623
I ask that you admit it into evidence.

1812
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:41,831
Your honour.

1813
01:35:44,013 --> 01:35:45,003
A news report?

1814
01:35:45,061 --> 01:35:46,939
Let's see where it takes us.

1815
01:35:47,023 --> 01:35:50,061
-Let's take object later.
-Thank you, your honour.

1816
01:35:52,287 --> 01:35:54,163
If you could read this for us.

1817
01:35:54,250 --> 01:35:57,321
Mr. Corliss... I've highlighted
the part I'd like you to read.

1818
01:35:57,464 --> 01:35:59,129
-I'm not good at reading.
-That's okay.

1819
01:35:59,229 --> 01:36:00,616
You can take your time,
we'll make it through it.

1820
01:36:03,771 --> 01:36:07,052
A man, Frederick Bentley...

1821
01:36:08,946 --> 01:36:12,773
wrongly convicted of rape
was released saturday after...

1822
01:36:13,085 --> 01:36:16,124
conclusive DNA results
cleared him of the crime.

1823
01:36:16,300 --> 01:36:18,254
The case was bolstered at trial by

1824
01:36:18,344 --> 01:36:21,337
a testimony from an informant...

1825
01:36:21,519 --> 01:36:24,365
DJ Corliss in May 7th,
who would claimed

1826
01:36:24,366 --> 01:36:25,887
Bentley bragged to him about
the rape...

1827
01:36:26,015 --> 01:36:27,913
-while together in a holding cell...
-That's enough.

1828
01:36:28,702 --> 01:36:29,692
Thank you.

1829
01:36:29,746 --> 01:36:30,735
Mr. Corliss.

1830
01:36:31,837 --> 01:36:33,029
Were you charged with perjury...

1831
01:36:33,090 --> 01:36:34,887
in this incident, DJ?

1832
01:36:34,969 --> 01:36:36,004
No, I was not.

1833
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:39,486
Is that because the prosecution
was complicit to your confession?

1834
01:36:39,686 --> 01:36:40,343
Judge!

1835
01:36:40,700 --> 01:36:43,316
Were you promised the same
thing here, Mr. Corliss?

1836
01:36:43,445 --> 01:36:46,399
To say that Louis Roulet bragged
to you in the holding cell,

1837
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:47,917
isn't that what happen,
you lie then...

1838
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:48,885
-You lie now...
-Alright, Mr. Haller,

1839
01:36:48,886 --> 01:36:49,781
alright, Mr. Haller,

1840
01:36:49,782 --> 01:36:52,159
-that'll do! That'll do!
-Objection, your honour.

1841
01:36:52,785 --> 01:36:53,655
I'm sorry, your honour.

1842
01:36:54,163 --> 01:36:55,248
I have no more questions.

1843
01:36:56,862 --> 01:36:59,054
I'm excusing the jury
for an early lunch.

1844
01:36:59,744 --> 01:37:00,736
Bailiff, see them out.

1845
01:37:07,546 --> 01:37:08,534
Mr. Minton.

1846
01:37:09,509 --> 01:37:11,466
Do you know what you have done?

1847
01:37:11,723 --> 01:37:14,714
You put a documented liar
on the stand.

1848
01:37:14,851 --> 01:37:17,977
A man with a record of putting
innocent people in prison!

1849
01:37:17,978 --> 01:37:19,238
-Your honour...
-Shut the hell up,

1850
01:37:19,239 --> 01:37:20,101
when I'm talking to you.

1851
01:37:24,074 --> 01:37:25,292
I can think of nothing...

1852
01:37:26,045 --> 01:37:27,538
more prejudicial or corrupt...

1853
01:37:28,101 --> 01:37:29,347
than what I just saw out there.

1854
01:37:31,183 --> 01:37:33,117
Do you realise,
what you have done to my trial?

1855
01:37:51,479 --> 01:37:52,828
He's gonna talk to his boss.

1856
01:37:52,882 --> 01:37:54,541
To decide what they
wanna do when the judge

1857
01:37:54,542 --> 01:37:55,982
comes out for the directive verdict.

1858
01:37:56,880 --> 01:37:57,781
What's a directive verdict?

1859
01:37:58,807 --> 01:38:00,783
It's when the judge takes the
case from the jury's hands.

1860
01:38:01,457 --> 01:38:02,491
Clears acquittal.

1861
01:38:03,044 --> 01:38:03,700
Oh my God.

1862
01:38:06,210 --> 01:38:07,321
It's no more than a few minutes.

1863
01:38:16,249 --> 01:38:19,275
I wanna know, how Corliss
got that shit he's saying.

1864
01:38:20,349 --> 01:38:21,943
Maybe Frank Levin told him.

1865
01:38:23,408 --> 01:38:25,590
Maybe he found something,
he gave it to Corliss.

1866
01:38:25,591 --> 01:38:26,797
And that's why you killed him.

1867
01:38:45,908 --> 01:38:46,863
Court's back in session.

1868
01:38:51,403 --> 01:38:53,145
Your honour, I spoke with
the district attorney.

1869
01:38:53,773 --> 01:38:56,033
The state wishes to dismiss
all charges.

1870
01:38:56,419 --> 01:38:57,698
You have the motion in front of you.

1871
01:38:58,006 --> 01:39:00,170
This is a motion to
dismiss with prejudice.

1872
01:39:00,946 --> 01:39:01,835
Case closed.

1873
01:39:02,235 --> 01:39:03,224
Yes, your honour.

1874
01:39:03,284 --> 01:39:04,936
Mr. Roulet, you're free to go.

1875
01:39:05,899 --> 01:39:06,625
Court's adjourned.

1876
01:39:09,505 --> 01:39:10,556
Mr. Haller.

1877
01:39:11,103 --> 01:39:12,784
Thank you so much for my son.

1878
01:39:12,817 --> 01:39:15,014
-You're welcome.
-You were splendid.

1879
01:39:15,852 --> 01:39:16,842
Thank you.

1880
01:39:21,466 --> 01:39:22,660
I want the gun.

1881
01:39:23,602 --> 01:39:24,876
Of course you do.

1882
01:39:26,541 --> 01:39:27,502
I wanna talk.

1883
01:39:27,917 --> 01:39:31,623
Mr. Haller. I insist you
join us for dinner tonight.

1884
01:39:31,633 --> 01:39:33,780
-For a celebration.
-I don't think so.

1885
01:39:34,077 --> 01:39:35,065
Louis Roulet.

1886
01:39:35,163 --> 01:39:36,756
You're under arrest.

1887
01:39:37,088 --> 01:39:39,042
-What do you think you're doing?
-Be quiet!

1888
01:39:39,310 --> 01:39:41,383
-Hands behind your back.
-What's the charge?

1889
01:39:41,486 --> 01:39:44,450
He's under arrest for the
murder of Donna Renteria.

1890
01:39:44,630 --> 01:39:46,620
Everything that man said was a lie!

1891
01:39:46,724 --> 01:39:48,242
You have the right to remain silent.

1892
01:39:48,404 --> 01:39:50,785
You have the right to have an
attorney present during questioning.

1893
01:39:50,873 --> 01:39:53,163
And if you give up that right,
anything you say can

1894
01:39:53,164 --> 01:39:55,083
and will be used against you
in the court of law.

1895
01:39:55,101 --> 01:39:57,060
Do you understand your rights
as I've read them to you?

1896
01:39:57,665 --> 01:39:59,255
Hey! Look at me.

1897
01:39:59,289 --> 01:40:00,760
Do you understand your rights?

1898
01:40:00,879 --> 01:40:02,896
Detective, can I have a word with him?

1899
01:40:08,509 --> 01:40:09,347
Well... that's it, Louis.

1900
01:40:10,808 --> 01:40:12,055
I got you off.

1901
01:40:12,945 --> 01:40:14,938
Time to find yourself a new lawyer.

1902
01:40:17,094 --> 01:40:18,926
I've still got your gun.

1903
01:40:21,199 --> 01:40:23,191
And you're gonna have to
explain how you got it.

1904
01:40:28,655 --> 01:40:30,453
Thank you, detective.

1905
01:40:30,625 --> 01:40:31,615
Come on, Louis.

1906
01:40:39,127 --> 01:40:40,037
-Mary...
-Not a word.

1907
01:40:40,038 --> 01:40:41,453
You get my kid out of jail.

1908
01:40:43,101 --> 01:40:46,177
Haller... you are one
messed up son of a bitch.

1909
01:40:46,333 --> 01:40:48,291
First you get your client off.

1910
01:40:48,383 --> 01:40:49,453
For assault.

1911
01:40:49,557 --> 01:40:52,356
Only to burn him for murder.

1912
01:40:52,487 --> 01:40:55,561
You don't have enough to charge
him with the Renteria murder, do you?

1913
01:40:55,757 --> 01:40:58,672
Yeah, we got enough to screw with him.

1914
01:40:58,812 --> 01:41:01,704
There's no way the DA was
letting Roulet walk out of here...

1915
01:41:01,900 --> 01:41:03,158
not after what just happened.

1916
01:41:06,226 --> 01:41:07,343
I don't get you, Haller.

1917
01:41:08,407 --> 01:41:11,493
Whose side are you on anyway, huh?

1918
01:41:28,770 --> 01:41:29,704
Goddamn it.

1919
01:41:33,013 --> 01:41:34,002
Earl!

1920
01:41:37,160 --> 01:41:38,148
Dude...

1921
01:41:38,372 --> 01:41:41,635
Hey, I'm sorry boss. Look, I stepped
away for half a minute, alright?

1922
01:41:41,637 --> 01:41:42,688
Alright, alright, alright.

1923
01:41:43,108 --> 01:41:44,298
Take the ticket out of my pay,
alright?

1924
01:41:44,702 --> 01:41:45,666
You don't make enough.

1925
01:41:46,055 --> 01:41:47,908
-This one's on me. Let's roll.
-Alright.

1926
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:52,112
Alright, let's go to the house, Earl.

1927
01:41:54,654 --> 01:41:56,130
-Hey, boss.
-Hm-hm?

1928
01:41:56,338 --> 01:41:58,063
You know you had a favour
you asked me?

1929
01:42:02,364 --> 01:42:03,953
The guy I know,
he picked it up on the street.

1930
01:42:04,946 --> 01:42:06,284
Real clean.

1931
01:42:58,446 --> 01:43:00,273
Hey, boss. Be careful, alright?

1932
01:43:00,578 --> 01:43:01,508
Yes, sir!

1933
01:43:31,458 --> 01:43:33,221
<i>Mick, it's me.
I tried you on your cell...</i>

1934
01:43:33,222 --> 01:43:35,350
<i>Sorry to interrupt your date
with Hayley, but...</i>

1935
01:43:35,351 --> 01:43:36,688
<i>You asked me to dig on Roulet?</i>

1936
01:43:37,089 --> 01:43:38,690
<i>Remember? You said you didn't buy it,</i>

1937
01:43:38,691 --> 01:43:40,181
<i>that all he had was parking tickets?</i>

1938
01:43:40,450 --> 01:43:43,040
<i>Well, I might have found Martinez's...</i>

1939
01:43:43,513 --> 01:43:45,350
Maggie, I got it.

1940
01:43:45,487 --> 01:43:46,570
I think I know why
Frank Levin got killed.

1941
01:43:46,580 --> 01:43:46,925
<i>Yeah?</i>

1942
01:43:47,122 --> 01:43:49,572
Alright, call Lankford, have him
pull up Roulet's driving record.

1943
01:43:49,573 --> 01:43:50,940
Every ticket he ever got.

1944
01:43:51,107 --> 01:43:52,848
Now, that's what Frank did.
He said he found

1945
01:43:52,849 --> 01:43:55,754
Martinez's ticket out of the queue.
I just never knew what he meant.

1946
01:43:55,980 --> 01:43:57,695
<i>Okay, done, but I have to
tell you something.</i>

1947
01:43:57,780 --> 01:43:58,844
They let Roulet go.

1948
01:43:59,304 --> 01:44:01,380
Hm-hm... they didn't
have enough to hold him.

1949
01:44:01,390 --> 01:44:03,291
<i>You're right. I guess with him,
we got involved.</i>

1950
01:44:03,555 --> 01:44:04,489
Maggie, is Hayley with you?

1951
01:44:04,824 --> 01:44:06,074
She's at my sister's, why?

1952
01:44:06,403 --> 01:44:07,921
<i>Go to your sister's. Stay with Hayley.</i>

1953
01:44:08,072 --> 01:44:10,034
And wait for my call. You got it?

1954
01:44:10,127 --> 01:44:11,118
<i>Okay.</i>

1955
01:44:16,341 --> 01:44:17,415
Val, it's Mick Haller.

1956
01:44:17,522 --> 01:44:18,513
<i>Oh, hey Mick.</i>

1957
01:44:18,611 --> 01:44:20,514
I haven't heard from you since
you busted into my office...

1958
01:44:20,670 --> 01:44:22,671
and accused me of conspiracy
to commit murder, huh?

1959
01:44:22,811 --> 01:44:25,080
You know, if I have any self respect,
I'd hang up on you right now.

1960
01:44:25,100 --> 01:44:27,590
Wait, wait, Frank died, alright?
I was out of my head.

1961
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:29,329
<i>-I need you to do me a favour.</i>
-Oh, you need a favour, okay?

1962
01:44:29,339 --> 01:44:32,827
You know, you got more balls than a
Chinese Ping Pong tournament, okay?

1963
01:44:33,090 --> 01:44:33,707
-I'll give you that.
-Alright, listen...

1964
01:44:33,708 --> 01:44:35,735
You can kick my ass later, alright?

1965
01:44:35,886 --> 01:44:38,193
It's important.
Is Roulet still wearing the tracer?

1966
01:44:38,700 --> 01:44:39,617
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, he is.</i>

1967
01:44:39,651 --> 01:44:41,570
I gotta call him. He's coming in
the morning to get it off.

1968
01:44:42,280 --> 01:44:44,824
-Guess they kicked him, huh?
-Yeah, I need you to track him for me.

1969
01:44:44,944 --> 01:44:46,723
<i>Oh, I can't, I can't,</i> I can't!

1970
01:44:46,724 --> 01:44:48,322
I got little Betty
coming in a few minutes.

1971
01:44:48,323 --> 01:44:50,851
<i>Val, Val.. stop whatever you're doing.</i>
I need it, man.

1972
01:44:51,003 --> 01:44:51,973
I need you to do it now.

1973
01:44:52,169 --> 01:44:53,062
It's about my family.

1974
01:44:58,247 --> 01:44:58,738
Yeah?

1975
01:45:00,008 --> 01:45:02,804
It's me. He's headed out
north on San Fernando.

1976
01:45:03,507 --> 01:45:05,009
Mick, Mick, I think
he's headed for your house.

1977
01:45:05,010 --> 01:45:06,108
You want me to call the cops for you?

1978
01:45:06,529 --> 01:45:08,360
-Bullshit.
-I'm telling you,

1979
01:45:08,361 --> 01:45:09,397
he's just passed down the stadium.

1980
01:45:10,697 --> 01:45:13,288
<i>No, no, no.</i> He's not going
to my house, Val.

1981
01:45:13,875 --> 01:45:15,099
<i>Oh, hey, hey, hey...</i>

1982
01:45:15,141 --> 01:45:17,246
You're right, you're right. 
He's just shot passed your street.

1983
01:45:17,247 --> 01:45:18,155
He's not headed for your house.

1984
01:45:19,214 --> 01:45:20,335
I know where he's going.

1985
01:45:22,793 --> 01:45:23,482
Hello?

1986
01:45:24,013 --> 01:45:24,742
You're welcome.

1987
01:45:25,103 --> 01:45:26,365
No, it's alright,
don't worry about it.

1988
01:46:12,981 --> 01:46:14,169
Hello, Louis.

1989
01:46:15,334 --> 01:46:16,403
My family's here.

1990
01:46:17,780 --> 01:46:18,279
I know.

1991
01:46:19,020 --> 01:46:19,825
You bring your knife?

1992
01:46:21,138 --> 01:46:21,771
And my gun?

1993
01:46:23,812 --> 01:46:24,315
Maybe.

1994
01:46:25,683 --> 01:46:26,278
Good.

1995
01:46:30,045 --> 01:46:31,207
'Cos I brought this.

1996
01:46:33,329 --> 01:46:36,243
You got one chance
to turn around and leave.

1997
01:46:40,223 --> 01:46:40,784
And then what?

1998
01:46:43,702 --> 01:46:44,914
You gonna keep
coming back every night?

1999
01:46:46,906 --> 01:46:47,897
Everyday?

2000
01:46:49,764 --> 01:46:53,198
Or just try to get me sent up to
San Quentin, like Jesus Martinez?

2001
01:46:54,286 --> 01:46:55,272
No.

2002
01:46:56,392 --> 01:46:59,928
I'm not quitting until Martinez is
free and you're convicted of murder.

2003
01:47:00,776 --> 01:47:02,868
And when that needle
goes in your arm...

2004
01:47:06,046 --> 01:47:07,842
That will be me.

2005
01:47:10,217 --> 01:47:12,129
Well, why don't you
just shoot me right now?

2006
01:47:15,402 --> 01:47:16,472
I don't think I'll have to.

2007
01:47:19,108 --> 01:47:19,643
Hey!

2008
01:47:23,035 --> 01:47:23,840
That's my car!

2009
01:47:24,328 --> 01:47:25,032
What are you doing?

2010
01:47:25,582 --> 01:47:26,618
It's Louis's car, man!

2011
01:47:29,449 --> 01:47:30,035
Yeah!

2012
01:47:31,292 --> 01:47:32,809
Come on, now. Get him up. Get up!

2013
01:47:36,023 --> 01:47:37,484
Hospital, not the morgue.

2014
01:48:01,570 --> 01:48:02,564
Hey, Mags.

2015
01:48:02,631 --> 01:48:03,962
<i>You were right, Mick.</i>

2016
01:48:03,972 --> 01:48:06,990
Roulet got a ticket
outside of Renteria's apartment

2017
01:48:06,991 --> 01:48:08,515
on the night that she was murdered.

2018
01:48:09,105 --> 01:48:11,250
It's all gonna be on the
DA's desk in the morning.

2019
01:48:11,870 --> 01:48:12,636
<i>Where are you?</i>

2020
01:48:13,033 --> 01:48:13,801
Just about home.

2021
01:48:15,185 --> 01:48:16,342
So, what do you say, I come
pick up you and Hayley...

2022
01:48:16,416 --> 01:48:19,262
at your sister's place in an hour.
<i>We go out for a nice dinner, huh?</i>

2023
01:48:19,469 --> 01:48:21,387
Great. Yeah.

2024
01:48:21,498 --> 01:48:23,042
See you in an hour.

2025
01:48:44,507 --> 01:48:45,846
Breaking and entering, huh?

2026
01:48:48,009 --> 01:48:49,176
Just like your son.

2027
01:48:50,774 --> 01:48:52,462
You knew, Mr. Haller.

2028
01:48:52,568 --> 01:48:54,857
You need to get the hell
out of my house, Ms. Windsor.

2029
01:48:55,178 --> 01:48:56,734
You knew. You set him up.

2030
01:48:57,008 --> 01:48:58,376
The only person that was
set up here...

2031
01:48:59,387 --> 01:49:00,031
... was me.

2032
01:49:01,228 --> 01:49:02,264
And how did that turn out for you?

2033
01:49:02,510 --> 01:49:04,562
You have no idea who we are.

2034
01:49:04,572 --> 01:49:07,988
I know that your son, Louis is going
down for the murder of Donna Renteria.

2035
01:49:08,359 --> 01:49:10,342
I also know that
I'm gonna burn his ass

2036
01:49:10,343 --> 01:49:11,922
for killing my friend, Frank Levin.

2037
01:49:11,923 --> 01:49:13,307
-He didn't kill him.
-Yes, he did.

2038
01:49:13,673 --> 01:49:15,523
He beat the tracer, and he killed him.

2039
01:49:15,524 --> 01:49:17,205
Look, I'm not gonna talk
about it with you.

2040
01:49:17,844 --> 01:49:18,768
And for the last time...

2041
01:49:18,994 --> 01:49:20,346
Get the hell out of my house.

2042
01:49:20,562 --> 01:49:21,684
You're not listening to me.

2043
01:49:22,140 --> 01:49:23,536
No, you're not listening to me.

2044
01:49:24,350 --> 01:49:25,738
Ms. Windsor, get the hell
out of my house.

2045
01:49:27,589 --> 01:49:30,709
I told you,
my son didn't kill Frank Levin.

2046
01:49:32,407 --> 01:49:33,011
I did.

2047
01:49:58,230 --> 01:49:59,740
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

2048
01:50:28,585 --> 01:50:29,997
I thought I told you to
be careful, man?

2049
01:50:33,300 --> 01:50:37,922
-Eeiyah, stop!
-Nobody till somebody shoot you.

2050
01:50:43,096 --> 01:50:44,396
Hey boss! Feeling alright?

2051
01:50:45,950 --> 01:50:47,419
Yeah, Earl. Solid.

2052
01:50:48,596 --> 01:50:51,394
I heard down at the court house.
Martinez is out, is that right?

2053
01:50:52,628 --> 01:50:53,510
Yes, it is.

2054
01:50:54,865 --> 01:50:56,969
That Roulet, they going for the
death penalty on him?

2055
01:50:59,450 --> 01:51:00,802
Martinez is free.

2056
01:51:12,255 --> 01:51:14,712
-Boss, we got company.
-Yeah, see that.

2057
01:51:16,101 --> 01:51:18,802
Pullover up there on the left.
Stay alert!

2058
01:51:48,386 --> 01:51:51,926
-What you say, Eddie?
-Took more than a team, huh?

2059
01:51:52,270 --> 01:51:52,803
Yeah!

2060
01:51:54,004 --> 01:51:55,425
You really shoot your client's mother?

2061
01:51:55,878 --> 01:51:58,208
Damn right, I did. She shot me first.

2062
01:52:00,863 --> 01:52:04,145
Well, glad you're better because...

2063
01:52:05,105 --> 01:52:08,393
-My boy, Harold... a hard case.
-Don't tell me?

2064
01:52:09,080 --> 01:52:12,479
He got caught with 50 kilos in
his girlfriend mini's van.

2065
01:52:13,460 --> 01:52:15,377
Girlfriend is some cop's wife.

2066
01:52:15,447 --> 01:52:16,559
-Doesn't help?
-No.

2067
01:52:17,959 --> 01:52:20,894
You're the only help he's got,
Counsellor.

2068
01:52:22,571 --> 01:52:24,308
Alright. Call me with the details.

2069
01:52:24,809 --> 01:52:27,300
Gotta say, bro.
The way things went down,

2070
01:52:27,301 --> 01:52:29,075
I think we earn a little discount.

2071
01:52:29,727 --> 01:52:32,431
Say... half your fee.

2072
01:52:37,035 --> 01:52:37,939
Tell you what, Eddie.

2073
01:52:40,306 --> 01:52:41,900
How about I do this one for free?

2074
01:52:49,633 --> 01:52:51,276
Are you sure you feelin' alright?

2075
01:52:52,329 --> 01:52:56,310
Repeat customers, Earl.
Stick it to him next time.
