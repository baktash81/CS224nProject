Gotta still hit the
farmers' market.

- What time is it?
- 10:00-ish.

8
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,959
- It's 10:00?
- Mm-hm.

00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,199
I gotta pick up the kid.
Where's Tony?

10
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,359
Tony and I were out late last night.
But don't worry, he's gonna be here.

11
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,839
- You got this?
- Yes.

12
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,830
He's not gonna flake. Neither am I.

- Wake up.

Why you think I slept
here for, bro?

00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,839
Let's get going on the soup.
We're behind on the egg prep.

18
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,839
And get the mise on the steak.
You still shitfaced?

- No, I'm good. I'm good, Chef.
- Alright.

Buckle up, buddy. Sorry I'm late.

00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,079
I'm used to it.

Listen, pal, I don't think we
have time to catch a movie today.

27
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,679
Is it 'cause you're
getting reviewed?

28
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,359
- Yeah, how'd you know about that?
- Mom told me.

29
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,919
What'd she say?

30
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,999
She said you might
be a little worried.

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,919
- She said I was worried?
- Yeah.

32
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,359
Well, Mom doesn't know
me that well, OK?

33
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,719
- She's pretty spot-on about you.
- Oh, yeah?

34
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,559
You know what Mommy
thinks I should be doing?

35
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,159
- What?
- That I should get a food truck.

36
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,999
- I like food trucks.
- Yeah, I like food trucks.

37

Who doesn't like food trucks?

38
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,719
Can you picture me driving
a food truck? I'm a chef.

39
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,839
- I work in a restaurant.
- OK.

40
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,559
Listen, I gotta go to the farmers'
market, pick up some ingredients.

41
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,999
OK. Can I come?

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,839
I thought I'd drop you
off at the restaurant.

- Molly's there.
- No, I wanna go with you.

44

- You're not gonna ask me
for everything you see?
- No.

45
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,279
It's not about you eating,
it's about me buying groceries.

46
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,719
- I know.
- OK. Good.

47
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,319
- You got the purple and white?
- Just orange.

48
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,159
Just orange? Alright, give
me six bunches of those.

49
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,639
- Or eight of the small.
- Dad.

50

Hang on a second, buddy. And on the
radishes here, I use the tops, OK?

51
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,159
- I need consistent tops.
- Dad.

52

Six of these. Let's see what we got.

53

- Dad.
- What do you want, Percy?

54
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,239
- Can I please have kettle corn?
- Daddy's working, OK?

55
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,719
No, you're not gonna get kettle...

56
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,119
- Why don't you get a piece of fruit?
- I don't want fruit.

57
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,719
How can you even ask for kettle corn?
You know what it is?

58
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,239
- No.
- It's carbs covered with sugar, OK?

59
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,919
Look at this piece of fruit.

60
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,559
Huh? It's beautiful.

61
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,039
How could you even want kettle corn

62
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,879
with gorgeous fruit like
this in front of you?

a piece of fruit?

sending a big reviewer

who's also some huge food blogger.

66
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,399
- You know what a food blogger is?
- Yeah.

67
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,759
A guy who writes about
food on the internet.

68
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,399
I know what a food blogger is.

69
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,799
Well, this guy's a big one,
and a lot of these big guys,

70
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,279
they don't like me.

71
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,319
They got it in for me because I got
good write-ups when I started out.

72
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,239
- They're haters.
- Exactly.

73
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,239
We didn't have that word
when I was growing up.

74
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,719
There was no word for hater.

75
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,959
The most you would say is that
somebody was, like, jealous,

76
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,439
which didn't really capture it.

77
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,639
The sausage guy's here.
You ever try andouille sausage?

78
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,119
- No.
- It's spicy.

79
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,559
- You like spicy?
- No.

80
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,505
It's not so spicy. Come on.

81
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,759
That's from New Orleans.
You ever heard of New Orleans?

82
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,239
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

83
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,719
It's part of the United States.

84
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,359
It's part of the Louisiana
Purchase from Napoleon.

85
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,879
Yeah. Um, that was...

86
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,679
I mean, like, now. That
was a long time ago.

87
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,239
- 1803.
- Whatever.

88
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,319
Talking about the food,
the culture, you know?

89
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,679
Like this andouille sausage.

90
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,239
- Beignets. You ever hear of that?
- We can get it here.

91
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,719
Not the same.

92
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,119
When you have it here, it's
good because it reminds you of,

93
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,039
like, a whole world of memories
that you have of being there.

94
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,919
'Cause it's like... I'm telling you,
it's like a whole different world.

95
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,999
- We should go there sometime.
- Definitely.

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,919
- For real?
- Yeah.

97
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,599
I mean, not now.

98
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,079
- But, like...
- When?

99
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,867
I don't know. I got...
Everything's very full for me.

100
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,959
- I got this reviewer coming.
- After the review?

101
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,199
Yeah, after review. That'd be good.

102
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,839
I'm off school next month.

103
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,959
Next month? Yeah.
We could go next month.

104
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,439
- Awesome.
- Or whatever. Or, like, if you're...

105
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,919
If it doesn't... I'll ask Mom.

106
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,919
If it doesn't work out next
month, we'll go later.

107
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,071
- But we'll definitely check it out.
- I already did. She's cool with it.

108
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,599
- You asked her already?
- Mm-hm.

109

Where'd you get a phone? How
come you have a phone already?

110

get the sauce on there, OK?

112
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,479

I gotta watch this too?

ankles, 'cause here comes papi chulo.

people. How we doing?

115

broken down, bacon are fine.

116
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,719
The stock is simmering.
That means reducing.

117

Good. Guys, big night tonight.

I want people having fun
at all the tables around.

Call your pretty friends, bring 'em in.
Tell 'em the tickets are on me.

Let's get out there.

ruler out. Thank you.

00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,679
- Oh, Chef.
- I got the good shit.

124
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,679
- You see this, Martin?
- Look at that. That's a specimen.

131
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,159
I don't know. He was
on his way back here.

132
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,319
I got him espresso, bought
you five minutes of time.

133
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,919
You should meet him
out on the floor.

134
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,319
Stall him for five minutes. Let
me get the staff going. Please.

135
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,559
OK. Fine. Expect him
to come back here.

psychopath from coming back here?

138

- You gotta have a plan.
- You want me to pickle these?

139
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,879
Yeah, pickle these.
I want you to pickle...

Are you, uh... are you
planning on altering the menu?

00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,159
Yeah, I can't do this right
now. Please, just...

- You know a lot is on the line today.
- I know.

That's why the menu
has to be perfect.

147
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,599
- But I can help you plan it.
- I can't do this right now.

148

Give me five minutes with my staff,
I'll walk you through the menu.

I've done this before.
I can help guide you.

150

I don't need guidance
right now. I need space.

- Let me get back to work.
- You know who's coming tonight.

171
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,359
We're being reviewed by the most
important critic in the city.

172

- Yes. I'm aware.
- His online blog was sold to AOL...

173

you put guts on the menu?

Is that what you mean?

186
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,279
Yeah. When you put that artsy shit
on the menu, people don't like it.

187

your sweetbreads.

- Right.

You know why you get it?

193
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,639
- I appreciate it.
- Do you know why?

194
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,119
Because you deserve it.

195
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,159

But I know it.

- No.
- No!

You'd burn the place
to the fucking ground.

00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,079
Yeah, I just sent a private
message to somebody.

499
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,999
- To who?
- To that A-hole food critic.

500
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,239
You could only send private messages
to people who are following you.

501
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,279
I think you might have
posted that publicly.

502
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,879
No, he wrote something nasty
about me and then I hit reply

503
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,719
and it let me send
a message to him.

504
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,639
Dad, replies are public.
Everybody can read them.

505
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,279
And it looks like he re-tweeted it

506
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:39,279
to all his 123,845 followers.

507
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,430
And he wrote back.

508
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,910
What did he say?

509
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,439
- I don't think I should read it.
- Just...

510
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,319
Can you read it to me, please?

511
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,549
Read the reply.

They're goading me into
responding to this prick.

- Don't do it. Don't do it, man.
- Don't do that, Chef.

524
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,959
- Don't respond. Take the high road.
- I know.

But half the people
are saying he's right.

Yeah, but half the people
are saying he's wrong.

- That's right. Listen to him.

- Don't. What are you writing?

00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,999
Chef, don't... That's
not a good idea.

534
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,839

So get ready for a fight.

00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,639
I'm gonna go drop Percy
off and come back

544
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,439
and cook the menu we
should've cooked last time.

there's a lot of bad language.

00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,159
So? I hear bad
language all the time.

551
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,319
- Where?
- Online.

552
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,959
What kind of website could a 10-year-old
get on that has bad language?

553
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,239
- YouTube.
- YouTube has bad language?

554
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,839
Could I at least come
shopping with you?

555
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,319
- No.
- (SIGHS)

556
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,505
I got a lot to do and
a lot on my mind.

557
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,707
CARL: Look who's waiting
for us. Hi, Mommy.

558
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,679
Come here. I miss you.
Give me a kiss.

559
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,599
- Hi.
- Hi.

560
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,879
So my publicist said that
she can talk to you.

561
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,639
- Why don't you talk to her?
- About what?

562
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,599
- About Twitter?
- Everybody's reading what you wrote.

563
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,919
- I don't think you get it.
- Get what?

564
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,582
Let's call her. Go inside
with me and we'll call her.

565
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,559
Yes, please, tell her
to call me immediately.

566
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,079
I have Carl with me.
I'm at home. Thank you.

567
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,399
- Alright, I'm gonna go.
- No, no, she's gonna call right back.

568
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,439
- She was on the other line.
- You're making more of this than it is.

569
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,279
I just don't like to
see you like this.

570
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,279
Like what? I'm fine.
I have to get to work.

571
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,279
You're never going to be happy
cooking for someone else.

572
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,919
Is this about the food truck?
I don't wanna talk about it again.

573
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,919
Why not? You can cook your own
food. You can be your own boss.

574
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,159
I can book you for all the
parties that I'm doing.

575
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,159
I appreciate the offer, but
I don't need any charity

576
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,639
from you or your ex-husband.

577
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,919
- Why are you being so proud?
- Because I'm working.

578
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,399
And despite what you might think,

579
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,559
I have complete freedom to
cook whatever I want now.

580
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,039
I like my life.

581
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,039
And as far as your publicist goes,
when she calls back, you let her know

582
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,239
that I understand I shouldn't
tweet any pictures of my dick

583
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,039
and any career advice
should be kept to oneself.

584
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,479
OK? I'll see you later. Thank you.

585
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,119
- I got all this shit in the trunk.
- Want me to do this?

586
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,559
- Is it on?
- Yeah. We're doing it.

587
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,559
- We're doing it, guys.
- Come on. Let's get everything out.

588
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:51,439
I want the Cambros, the delis
out so we can start plating, OK?

589
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,439
Carl, can you tell me what's
going on for tonight?

590
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,439
No, no, no, how many
covers do we have tonight?

591
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,159
How many? We are overbooked.
But I just printed out all the menus.

592
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,239
Good. It's not the menu you
got printed. It's different.

593
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,079
- That's what I understand.
- We're doing a tasting menu.

594
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,879
- Carl, I have to put the wine...
- A tasting menu for Ramsey Michel.

595
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,879
- I know, but we...
- He's coming. He knows about it.

596
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,439
- Did you see the 'Eater' article?
- I did.

597
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,319
- I'm so excited for you.
- It's all over the internet.

598
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,319
- I love it when you're like this.
- Taste the food.

599
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,319
Bring in the waitstaff,
have 'em taste the food.

600
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,759
Make them understand
what we're going for.

601
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,079
- OK.
- OK?

602
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,079
We're not pushing specials today.
The whole menu is special.

603
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,559
- I'm excited.
- I'm excited. I'm finally happy.

604
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,039
I'm happy, OK?

605
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,039
- Am I allowed to be happy at work?
- (DOOR OPENS)

606
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,439
Carl. Carl. We're staying
with the same menu, right?

607
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,039
I have something really
good planned for tonight.

608
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,519
I'm gonna let you...
It's not sweetbreads.

609
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,679
- You're gonna be able to taste it.
- That may be true.

610
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,279
But we have the most reservations
on a work night since we opened.

611
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,119
- You realise that?
- I know. I was on Twitter.

612
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,959
- Yeah.
- I was promoting the restaurant.

613
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,999
- I was on Twitter.
- What? Yeah, that's another thing.

614
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,679
From now on, before you post
anything online, I OK it. Alright?

615
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,159
The whole reason
everybody's here tonight

616
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,759
is because I called out
Ramsey Michel online

617
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,159
and they're all coming to
watch me stick it in his ass.

618
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,999
Yeah, and you're gonna
twitter an apology

619
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,399
for calling the most respected
critic in Los Angeles an asshole.

620
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,599
- I'm not gonna fucking apologise.
- What do you mean, you're not...

621
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,079
- You see what he wrote about me?
- I don't give a fuck...

622
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,919
- He started it!
- ..what he wrote. I don't care.

623
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,839
You're a cook. You're a chef.

624
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,519
This is what you've been cooking
for years, and it works.

625
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,799
And either you cook the menu that
our customers have come to ex...

626
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,039
- You want me to cook the same food?
- The same exact...

627
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:15,279
The same food that he ripped apart?
The same guy who's coming tonight?

628
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,879
The restaurant isn't
filled with critics!

629
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,879
It's filled with people
that've been eating your food

630
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,159
for the last 10 years!

631
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,919
So now, suddenly, you're
gonna be an artist.

632
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,519
Well, be an artist
on your own time.

633
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,999
- Listen to me.
- No sweetbreads!

634
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,439
- Listen!
- No calves' brains.

635
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,919
I'm not cooking sweetbreads!
Listen to me.

636
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,039
The kitchen is my domain.
That was our deal.

637
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,879
I don't give a fuck
what the deal was!

638
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,439
The deal is now changed.
Either you stay or you go.

639
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,147
It's up to you. End of discussion.

640
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,239
- We got a full house of people... - Yeah.
- ..who are coming tonight... - Yeah.

641
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,559
- ..To eat my food.
- No, it's not your food, Carl.

642
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,559
It's not your food.

643
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,799
By definition, it's my food
because it's my restaurant.

644
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,119
I pay for the glasses.
I pay for the napkins.

645
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,759
I pay for the spoons.
I pay for Molly's salary.

646
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,239
I pay for your entire
staff's salary, OK?

647
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,519
So you either cook
my menu or Tony can.

648
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,519
Tony, you've been cooking
it half the time anyway.

649
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,704
Tell the truth. Right?

650
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,039
So you're threatening
to fire me now?

651
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,519
Am I threatening to fire you?

652
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,319
No, I'm telling you
what I'm prepared to do

653
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,999
if you don't cook my menu.

654
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,559
Subject closed.

655
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,279
Well, why don't you cook

action or something?

Is he there?

820
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,439
I'll tell him.

821
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,559
Ah, let me... let me talk to him.

822
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,550
Put him on.

823
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:17,839
Hey, Dad. I understand if
we can't go to New Orleans.

824
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,279
CARL: Oh, man, thank you
so much for saying that.

825
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,799
Just Daddy's so busy with work
right now. You're the best.

826
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,759
Maybe some other time.

827
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,343
Yes, we will, for sure. Thank you.

828
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,268
'Bye. (HANGS UP)

830
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,479
Oh, jefecito.

831
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:50,399
What's up, man? Look,
everybody. Jefe's here.

832
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,439
Come on, give me some drinks.
Something premium.

833
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,783
Ketel One for the man.

834
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,199
Oh, dude. Oh, you're everywhere.

835
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,679
- You saw it?
- Ohh!

836
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,599
- It's bad. How bad is it?
- You saw it? You saw it?

837
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,079
- I saw it. It's everywhere.
- It's terrible.

838
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,879
- Is it bad?
- You're never gonna work again.

839
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,679
- (LAUGHS)
- I am, though.

840
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,319
No, seriously, there are people...
there are people who are calling me.

841
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,719
- Dude. Oh, great. I'm glad to hear that.
- Yes. Yes.

842
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,719
I knew you would have
something bigger than this.

843
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,519
- You don't care about coming back here.
- Yeah.

844
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:19,119
So you came back to tell
me you got me a gig?

845
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,599
'Cause I'll leave Gauloises
like that, baby.

846
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,239
No. Trust me, the first phone call
as soon as something becomes real.

847
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,839
- Don't leave me behind again.
- I will not.

848
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,439
- Don't ever do that again.
- Don't hit me.

849
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,039
- This guy.
- Please don't hit me. I'm sorry.

850
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,959
I'm really sorry.
I was on the spot, bro.

851
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,759
I had been drinking that day. I...
I... I didn't know what to do.

852
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,759
- I'm a pussy, basically. I'm sorry.
- It's OK. It's over.

853
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,999
- I vouch for that.
- It's fine. What are you gonna do?

854
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,239
- It's a big opport...
- But then they put you on YouTube.

855
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,959
And I felt so responsible
for that shit.

856
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,319
- That shit was funny, by the way.
- What was funny about it?

857
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,039
- It's not funny for me.
- Just that everybody I know saw it.

858
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,919
- I know, I know.
- I kinda felt famous by knowing you.

859
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:54,279
Is it a little bit funny? Like... Like, is it...
they're laughing at me or with me?

860
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,319
A little bit of both.

861
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,999
They're laughing with you and
at you at the same time.

862
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,559
- It's so embarrassing.
- Oh, it is terrible. It is so bad.

863
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,159
But it's funny too
at the same time.

864
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,159
It makes you kind of
likeable in a weird way.

865
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,319
Yeah. That guy deserved it. Everybody
knows that guy deserved it.

866
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,239
- But, seriously, I'm sorry.
- It's alright.

867
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,839
You know, I'm gonna
land on my feet.

868
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,279
- Oh, you will.
- Yeah, good. I know.

869
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,239
- I'll get my next gig.
- I'll be there with you.

870
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,199
- Everything will be fine.
- I'm your sous-chef now and forever.

871
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,599
You're not my sous-chef anymore.
You are chef de cuisine.

872
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,519
- But I wouldn't even be there...
- It doesn't matter.

873
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,239
Riva's right about one thing.

874
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,879
You are ready to run your
own kitchen. So don't blow it.

875
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,359
It's a big opportunity for you.

876
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,799
- To Tony's big new opportunity.
- To Tony's big opportunity.

877
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,159
- To chef de cuisine.
- I don't like how it happened.

878
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,719
- But I'm happy it happened. OK?
- (CHUCKLES) Two words, man.

879
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:38,348
You guys. I love you fucking guys.

880
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:42,439
- I love you, Tony. I love you.
- Thanks, Chef.

881
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,999
- Look at that.
- Mmm.

882
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,839
I love both of you.

883
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,319
We love you, man.

884
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,959
Let's have a three-way right here.
Come on. Come on. (LAUGHS)

885
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,559
- Hang on, hang on.
- I love you, man.

886
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:54,159
- I'm glad you made up with him.
- Thanks. Did you take the garbage out?

887
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,479
(SIGHS) The truth of the
matter is nobody's calling me.

888
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,439
I got no job prospects whatsoever.

889
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,839
- What about those offers you got?
- No. It's all dried out.

890
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:04,239
- Why, from the online shit?
- It must be from the online thing.

891
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,119
- Come on.
- I'm like a fucking cat playing a piano.

892
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,639
I don't even know what that means.

893
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,319
I'm everywhere.

894
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,159
- OK? Like, I'm, like... I'm, like, a meme.
- (CHUCKLES)

895
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:15,679
Know what a meme is?
I'm a meme. I'm a fucking meme.

896
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,719
Carl, you need to take a break.

897
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:20,079
I've been on a break.
I've had too much of a break.

898
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:22,079
- No, you need a real break.
- I need to work.

899
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,319
- I need to get back into a kitchen.
- You don't. Carl...

900
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:27,079
I wish I never... I should've cooked
the shit he wanted me to cook.

901
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,839
You gonna go work for another
Riva in some other restaurant?

902
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:33,559
You've been miserable here as
long as I've known you, Carl.

903
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,999
- That's not true. We've had a blast.
- Yes, we've had a blast.

904
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,343
And now it's time for you to go.

905
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,839
You don't belong here anymore.
You know it. Come on.

906
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,639
What's th... Who's this girl?

907
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,869
- Carl.
- (CHUCKLES) What?

908
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,199
- Be real with me.
- I am.

909
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,199
You've been ignoring a lot
of things in your life

910
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,509
that need your
attention, like Percy.

911
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,919
I'm not dad material right
now, if you hadn't noticed.

912
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,119
I'm embarrassing.

913
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:04,359
He sees all this shit
on the computer.

914
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,679
- Well...
- His friends have...

915
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,479
Maybe it's important for you
to talk to him about it, then.

916
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,439
- I just...
- He needs you, Carl.

917
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,599
I'm... I don't know him, OK?
He's at a weird age.

918
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,421
Why don't you take this
time to get to know him?

919
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,189
I want you to be happy.

920
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,470
You're not happy.

921
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,110
You're never gonna be happy here.

922
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,710
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

923
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,599
I've never not known what I was
gonna do. I've always known.

924
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,199
There's always been
the next thing to do.

925
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:45,879
And now that it's all ended, and I'm,
like... I'm, like, fucking lost.

926
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:48,621
I think that's a
good place to start.

927
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,270
Come here.

928
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,549
- You're the best.
- Yeah.

929
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,719
- I'll hold down the fort. I promise.
- OK. You do that.

930
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:09,745
Thank you.

931
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,279
Hi, Flora. Percy here?

932
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,119
Percy aqui?

933
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,999
- He's inside.
- Can you tell him I'm here?

934
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,479
- Sure.
- Thanks.

935
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,159
- Hi.
- Why are you here?

936
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:27,399
I'm here to see...
here to see Percy.

937
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:28,879
- Oh.
- It's been a while.

938
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,919
I'm glad you're here, but why didn't
you call to say that you were coming?

939
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,479
- I don't know, because...
- He said he's sleeping.

940
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,879
- OK. I'm gonna go talk to him.
- No, no, wait one second.

941
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,119
She said he says he's sleeping,
but if he was sleeping,

942
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:40,959
she'd just say he's sleeping,
so he's not sleeping.

943
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,319
- Let me talk to him.
- Can you talk to me for one second first?

944
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,902
Please? Come.

945
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:51,625
Percy and I are going to
Miami to see my father.

946
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,199
So why don't you come with us?

947
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,639
- What?
- Yeah, come with us.

948
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,439
You want me to go... I can't
come with you to Miami.

949
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,239
I don't... I got all...

950
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,919
I don't have any money.

951
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,719
I need to wait for another job,
for all this shit to blow over

952
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:07,199
with the internet,
Twitter, all that shit.

953
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,359
Yeah, but I could lend you
some money before you...

954
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,599
I don't want your money.
I can't take charity from you.

955
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,079
You know that he's really upset

956
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:16,106
because he couldn't go with
you to New Orleans, right?

957
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:20,140
He's hurt. He misses you.

958
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:25,119
OK. What do you want me to do?

959
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:27,559
You know that the nannies
can't get on the plane.

960
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:30,399
So why don't you come with us

961
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,346
and you take care of
him while I work?

962
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:36,079
So you need me to come
with you to watch Percy?

963
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,159
- Yeah.
- So I'm the nanny?

964
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:41,311
Yes, his nanny, in Miami.

965
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:45,399
It might be good. That's where
it all happened for you.

966
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,879
That's where Percy was born,

967
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,319
that's where you got your
first job as a chef.

968
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:52,039
Maybe it will just, like,
clear your mind out.

969
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:54,319
You think Percy would
be OK with that?

970
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,079
Percy would love it.

('BANG BANG' BY JOE CUBA)

972
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,710
Hm?

00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,710
What do you say?

974
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,599
I have to run out for

so make sure when you go upstairs
that everything is pressed,

order him some food, make sure
he takes a nap, a bath...

- Wait, wait, wait, a nap?
- Get him ready for tonight.

No shit! That's excellent!

1139

Congratulations, man.
That's a big deal.

1140

Thank you, man. That means a
lot coming from you, seriously.

1141
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:42,319
Yeah, but enough about me.
So, what are you gonna do?

You're gonna laugh.

fucking taco truck?

With Marvin. Did you
sleep with Marvin?

He's my ex-husband.

divorced. Have you slept...

Who did you sleep
with last, him or me?

your business what I did...

- Yeah, yeah.

and shared a life with...

Why do we have to talk
about this right now?

meeting with the guy.

- It is. I wanna know why.

got something on me.

- Please, you know him.

- You know how he is. So who cares?

- I care!
- Why do you need to know?

- OK.

It doesn't bother me.
I just wanna know.

I was very lonely.

to the chef, not to the kitchen.

It's a video. Look.

- Who'd make a video six seconds?

1619
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:28,639
- A six-second video.
- Can you believe this generation?

Unbelievable, man.
Little attention. ADHD.

No. You edit 'em all together.

1637
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:04,559
