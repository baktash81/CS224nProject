1
00:01:52,034 --> 00:01:54,161
You better get married soon.

2
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,831
You're starting to look old.

3
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,544
My dad has been saying that to me
since I was 15...

4
00:02:02,669 --> 00:02:06,131
because nice Greek girls are supposed
to do three things in life.

5
00:02:06,215 --> 00:02:10,219
Marry Greek boys, make Greek babies,
and feed everyone...

6
00:02:10,594 --> 00:02:12,429
until the day we die.

7
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:07,442
When I was growing up,
I knew I was different.

8
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,821
The other girls were blond and delicate.

9
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,408
And I was a swarthy 6-year-old
with sideburns.

10
00:03:14,491 --> 00:03:17,077
I so badly wanted to be
like the popular girls...

11
00:03:17,244 --> 00:03:19,371
all sitting together, talking...

12
00:03:19,705 --> 00:03:22,291
eating their Wonder Bread sandwiches.

13
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,084
What's that?

14
00:03:24,585 --> 00:03:26,128
It's moussaka.

15
00:03:26,628 --> 00:03:28,130
Moose ka-ka?

16
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,885
And while the pretty girls
got to go to Brownies...

17
00:03:32,968 --> 00:03:35,053
I had to go to Greek school.

18
00:03:44,605 --> 00:03:47,441
At Greek school,
I learned valuable lessons like.

19
00:03:47,524 --> 00:03:51,570
"If Nick has one goat and Maria has nine,
how soon will they marry?"

20
00:03:55,741 --> 00:03:59,870
My mom was always cooking foods
filled with warmth and wisdom...

21
00:03:59,912 --> 00:04:03,290
and never forgetting that side dish
of steaming-hot guilt.

22
00:04:03,332 --> 00:04:06,293
Niko, don't play with the food.

23
00:04:06,502 --> 00:04:09,338
When I was your age, we didn't have food.

24
00:04:09,463 --> 00:04:10,881
-Ma?
-What?

25
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,842
Why do I have to go to Greek school?

26
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:18,597
When you get married, don't you want to be
able to write your mother-in-law a letter?

27
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,932
Niko, come on, eat!

28
00:04:21,141 --> 00:04:25,854
We lived in a normal, middle-class Chicago
neighborhood of tasteful, modest homes.

29
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:29,358
Our house, however,
was modeled after the Parthenon...

30
00:04:29,441 --> 00:04:33,654
complete with Corinthian columns,
and guarded by statues of the gods.

31
00:04:34,154 --> 00:04:37,658
In case the neighbors had
any doubts about our heritage...

32
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:41,328
they could just check out
our subtle tribute to the Greek flag.

33
00:04:41,787 --> 00:04:44,331
My dad believed in only two things...

34
00:04:44,331 --> 00:04:47,709
that Greeks should educate non-Greeks
about being Greek...

35
00:04:47,835 --> 00:04:52,714
and that any ailment, from psoriasis
to poison ivy, could be cured with Windex.

36
00:04:55,092 --> 00:04:59,388
Six years later, I was 12.
Athena, my older, perfect sister, was 15.

37
00:04:59,429 --> 00:05:01,640
And my brother, Nick, was 11.

38
00:05:01,682 --> 00:05:05,811
Every morning, my dad would lecture us
on the "history of our people...

39
00:05:05,853 --> 00:05:08,772
"the great civilization, the Greeks. "

40
00:05:09,398 --> 00:05:12,985
Now, name three things the Greeks did first.

41
00:05:14,695 --> 00:05:17,322
Astronomy, philosophy, and democracy.

42
00:05:17,614 --> 00:05:19,241
Bravo! Very good.

43
00:05:20,909 --> 00:05:22,661
Now, give me a word...

44
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,329
any word...

45
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:28,208
and I show you, how the root of that word...

46
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:29,334
is Greek.

47
00:05:29,418 --> 00:05:31,044
Sweet Lord, again.

48
00:05:32,087 --> 00:05:35,048
How about "arachnophobia"?

49
00:05:35,799 --> 00:05:39,678
"Arachna," that comes from
the Greek word for spider...

50
00:05:40,262 --> 00:05:43,557
and "phobia" is a phobia, it means "fear."

51
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,852
So, "fear of spiders." There you go.

52
00:05:47,895 --> 00:05:51,190
Okay, Mr. Portokalos,
how about the word "kimono"?

53
00:05:52,149 --> 00:05:53,859
-"Kimono."
-Good one.

54
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,778
Kimono, kimono.

55
00:05:58,071 --> 00:06:01,950
Of course, "kimono"
comes from the Greek word...

56
00:06:02,284 --> 00:06:05,370
"cheimonas," which means "winter."

57
00:06:05,829 --> 00:06:09,124
So, what do you wear in the wintertime...

58
00:06:09,249 --> 00:06:11,502
to stay warm? A robe.

59
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,130
You see, "robe," "kimono." There you go.

60
00:06:22,137 --> 00:06:24,848
-Bye-bye.
-Goodbye, Mr. Portokalos.

61
00:06:29,978 --> 00:06:30,938
Toula!

62
00:06:33,941 --> 00:06:35,901
You should be proud to be Greek.

63
00:06:40,989 --> 00:06:42,574
A couple more years went by...

64
00:06:42,658 --> 00:06:45,744
and my dad brought his mother
from Greece to live with us...

65
00:06:45,827 --> 00:06:48,121
because we weren't weird enough.

66
00:07:04,179 --> 00:07:05,681
-Where is she going?
-Mama, please!

67
00:07:05,764 --> 00:07:07,975
The Greeks and the Turks friends now.

68
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,018
We told my grandma the war was over...

69
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,688
but she still slept
with a knife under her pillow.

70
00:07:15,649 --> 00:07:17,234
Stop hitting me!

71
00:07:18,652 --> 00:07:21,947
Niko, be careful.
She has a very mean punch.

72
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:39,173
Nice Greek girls who don't find a husband
work in the family restaurant.

73
00:07:39,214 --> 00:07:42,759
So, here I am, day after day, year after year.

74
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:45,762
Thirty, and way past my expiration date.

75
00:07:46,013 --> 00:07:48,140
My God. It's freezing.

76
00:07:49,641 --> 00:07:54,021
Fotoula! You closed last night,
you're opening this morning?

77
00:07:54,271 --> 00:07:55,522
I have no life.

78
00:07:57,191 --> 00:07:59,610
Fotoula, you talk to me sometime.

79
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,362
Ma, you're gonna make me
swallow my tongue.

80
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,283
Toula! Is Nikki here?

81
00:08:08,202 --> 00:08:09,161
What's up?

82
00:08:09,244 --> 00:08:12,414
No, my Nikki. She was supposed
to come over to curl my hairs.

83
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:15,709
Nick, did you check the meat
before you signed for it?

84
00:08:15,834 --> 00:08:18,170
-Dad checked it.
-It better be fresh.

85
00:08:18,378 --> 00:08:22,090
My brother has two jobs,
to cook and to marry a Greek virgin.

86
00:08:22,174 --> 00:08:25,469
Voula, have something to eat
before you go to work.

87
00:08:26,303 --> 00:08:30,390
If nagging was an Olympic sport,
my Aunt Voula would have a gold medal.

88
00:08:30,474 --> 00:08:32,935
Taki, you couldn't wait for me?

89
00:08:34,061 --> 00:08:35,187
Sorry.

90
00:08:35,354 --> 00:08:37,689
Sorry, sorry. Don't "sorry" me.

91
00:08:39,107 --> 00:08:42,444
Look at this. Rash.
Somebody gave me the mati.

92
00:08:42,569 --> 00:08:45,280
-Put some Windex on it.
-Oh, Gus, please.

93
00:08:46,073 --> 00:08:48,200
Voula! This works.

94
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:51,870
Last night, my toe was as big as my face.

95
00:08:54,414 --> 00:08:56,542
Why you not wait for me?

96
00:08:57,584 --> 00:09:00,254
Gus. He wants to talk.

97
00:09:03,882 --> 00:09:06,385
Anyway, I tell her...

98
00:09:06,969 --> 00:09:11,390
-I will send her to Greece to find somebody.
-She's not too old.

99
00:09:17,813 --> 00:09:19,273
She's okay.

100
00:09:19,439 --> 00:09:20,774
In Greece...

101
00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:22,943
don't tell anyone how old she is.

102
00:09:23,318 --> 00:09:25,988
-She won't go.
-She won't go?

103
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,491
It's like she don't want to get married.

104
00:09:32,119 --> 00:09:34,121
Come on, boys. Go in there.

105
00:09:34,329 --> 00:09:38,000
My sister married young and became
a Greek baby-breeding machine.

106
00:09:42,171 --> 00:09:44,047
Hey, guys. Come on, get out.

107
00:09:44,131 --> 00:09:45,299
Just a quick coffee.

108
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:48,844
I have to drop the boys off at hockey
and then I got to get to the Jewel.

109
00:09:48,969 --> 00:09:51,430
-Bread?
-Pantyhose are on for 99 cents.

110
00:09:51,471 --> 00:09:55,267
Then the priest is coming to bless
the new house, so I have to make diples.

111
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:58,478
Can you believe it? I'm out of honey.
Put that back for me.

112
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,022
You dropped my tzatziki.

113
00:10:00,147 --> 00:10:01,523
-Angelo!
-Nikki, shut up.

114
00:10:01,648 --> 00:10:04,234
My cousins have two volumes,
loud and louder.

115
00:10:04,359 --> 00:10:06,320
...your big-ass girlfriend. Thanks, Toula.

116
00:10:06,403 --> 00:10:07,321
Hey, Toula.

117
00:10:07,362 --> 00:10:08,614
We're not that late.

118
00:10:09,281 --> 00:10:10,407
Hi, everybody.

119
00:10:11,992 --> 00:10:15,120
Nikki, how come you didn't come
to curl my hair this morning?

120
00:10:15,204 --> 00:10:17,498
Ma, I had to drop Dimo at work.

121
00:10:17,789 --> 00:10:21,460
Now I got to go open the travel agency,
because some jack-off...

122
00:10:21,502 --> 00:10:23,504
and his big-ass girlfriend are too busy.

123
00:10:23,629 --> 00:10:28,008
Tell her I open up the cleaners every day.
It's time she does something for a change.

124
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,801
You know who's there this morning?

125
00:10:29,885 --> 00:10:32,387
-You're always at the beauty parlor.
-My husband.

126
00:10:32,471 --> 00:10:35,307
-Your nails, hair, everything.
-Don't talk about my hair.

127
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:38,143
You're lazy.
You and your big-ass girlfriend do nothing.

128
00:10:38,185 --> 00:10:40,812
Did somebody sit on your hair?
It looks a little flat.

129
00:10:40,854 --> 00:10:42,814
Angelo, bite me.

130
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,775
Disgusting, be a lady.

131
00:10:45,234 --> 00:10:46,318
Ma.

132
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,153
Angelo.

133
00:10:48,737 --> 00:10:51,073
Ande. Come on, boys. Let's go.

134
00:10:51,823 --> 00:10:54,701
-Athena, when did you come?
-Hi, Ma. Bye, Ma.

135
00:10:54,743 --> 00:10:55,869
You're going?

136
00:10:55,911 --> 00:10:58,539
I'm going to the Jewel.
I'll get you some pantyhose.

137
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:01,458
No queen size. They make me look fat.

138
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,710
No more fun and games.

139
00:11:04,002 --> 00:11:05,587
I didn't do it!

140
00:11:07,172 --> 00:11:08,632
Who put the menus there?

141
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,304
Toula, what's this?

142
00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:17,641
Toula, what is this?

143
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,893
-I don't know.
-Mama.

144
00:11:22,563 --> 00:11:24,481
Now don't forget, I need the plates and--

145
00:11:24,565 --> 00:11:27,901
And the pizza for the buffet.
You told me at dinner. Go. My God.

146
00:11:29,778 --> 00:11:31,530
All right, we're gonna go.

147
00:11:32,531 --> 00:11:35,033
-I wanna drive.
-You're driving me crazy, let's go.

148
00:11:36,618 --> 00:11:38,453
Just watch. Don't run.

149
00:11:45,878 --> 00:11:49,298
-To me, she looks okay.
-Okay? What okay? Nokay.

150
00:11:49,339 --> 00:11:53,260
She's not okay. Look.
Athena is married with three children.

151
00:11:53,343 --> 00:11:55,971
And I'll get married, Pops, I promise.

152
00:11:58,348 --> 00:12:01,101
You have plenty of time, Niko.

153
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:05,564
And you'll always have Toula
to run the restaurant.

154
00:12:06,273 --> 00:12:09,151
It's true. Toula will never leave you.

155
00:12:58,492 --> 00:13:00,494
I wish I had a different life.

156
00:13:01,245 --> 00:13:03,997
I wish I was braver and prettier...

157
00:13:04,373 --> 00:13:05,999
or just happy.

158
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:10,921
But it's useless to dream,
because nothing ever changes.

159
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:31,024
-Hey, what's going on?
-Hi. How are you?

160
00:13:31,441 --> 00:13:33,360
-Good. You?
-Oh, good.

161
00:13:34,903 --> 00:13:37,489
-Cool place.
-Yeah, it's adorable.

162
00:13:39,408 --> 00:13:42,244
You missed a hell of a party the other night.

163
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,830
Look at that.

164
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:47,583
That could have been you
with that arm around her.

165
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,460
You set me up with her already.

166
00:13:52,838 --> 00:13:54,798
-Nancy?
-Hanson's picnic.

167
00:13:56,758 --> 00:13:59,553
No, that was Pamela. This is Nancy.

168
00:14:03,348 --> 00:14:05,058
They look the same.

169
00:14:07,352 --> 00:14:08,770
Well, maybe.

170
00:14:09,188 --> 00:14:10,814
So, you want me to set you up?

171
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,609
They're all the same, Mike.

172
00:14:26,038 --> 00:14:27,372
-Hi.
-Hi.

173
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,295
Sorry, my brain stopped.

174
00:14:33,629 --> 00:14:37,841
You ever have one of those days,
when it's going along and then stops?

175
00:14:38,133 --> 00:14:41,762
Here I am, standing here,
your own private Greek statue.

176
00:14:46,934 --> 00:14:49,853
-Could I get some more coffee, please?
-Sure.

177
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,023
Thank you.

178
00:15:03,784 --> 00:15:05,577
All right, let's go.

179
00:15:05,828 --> 00:15:08,413
-What do you mean? I just got here.
-I got a class.

180
00:15:08,539 --> 00:15:10,958
I love the spice on these potatoes.
What is that?

181
00:15:10,999 --> 00:15:12,793
Like I care. Come on.

182
00:15:12,918 --> 00:15:16,380
Giving a pop quiz,
and I can't wait to hear the groans.

183
00:15:17,673 --> 00:15:18,841
Man, you're tough.

184
00:15:18,924 --> 00:15:21,760
I'm giving a test on Hamlet,
but I give fair warning.

185
00:15:33,021 --> 00:15:34,147
Hi.

186
00:15:35,732 --> 00:15:37,150
Keep the change.

187
00:15:51,623 --> 00:15:54,084
You like this, Pops? For the new menu?

188
00:15:54,918 --> 00:15:58,213
-Where did you get that?
-I drew it, Dad.

189
00:16:20,777 --> 00:16:23,322
Dad, I've been going through
our inventory...

190
00:16:23,447 --> 00:16:27,409
and I've noticed that we've been doing
a lot of unnecessary ordering.

191
00:16:27,451 --> 00:16:30,871
I've been thinking that
maybe we should update our system.

192
00:16:31,288 --> 00:16:33,540
We could get a computer.

193
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:38,045
I don't know if you remember,
but I got all A's in Computers.

194
00:16:38,128 --> 00:16:41,173
But there's a lot of new stuff to learn now...

195
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:45,719
so, if you want, I could go to college
and take a few courses.

196
00:16:49,723 --> 00:16:50,849
Why?

197
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:55,229
Why you want to leave me?

198
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,980
I'm not leaving you.

199
00:16:57,022 --> 00:16:59,191
Don't you want me
to do something with my life?

200
00:16:59,233 --> 00:17:02,694
Yes! Get married! Make babies!

201
00:17:03,737 --> 00:17:05,614
You look so old!

202
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:26,218
Hey, Toula. Come on.

203
00:17:27,344 --> 00:17:29,179
I know what you want.

204
00:17:30,097 --> 00:17:33,100
You have, how you say, a spirit.

205
00:17:34,351 --> 00:17:37,521
You want to see things. You want to learn.

206
00:17:38,564 --> 00:17:40,691
I know, you're from my side.

207
00:17:43,068 --> 00:17:46,405
Come on. Don't you worry.
I'm gonna talk to him.

208
00:17:47,489 --> 00:17:50,200
Dad is so stubborn. What he says goes.

209
00:17:50,284 --> 00:17:52,161
"The man is the head of the house."

210
00:17:52,452 --> 00:17:54,663
Let me tell you something, Toula.

211
00:17:54,788 --> 00:17:58,750
The man is the head,
but the woman is the neck.

212
00:17:59,001 --> 00:18:02,504
And she can turn the head
any way she wants.

213
00:18:05,424 --> 00:18:07,009
My baby.

214
00:18:07,551 --> 00:18:09,970
Don't cry. Come on.

215
00:18:10,721 --> 00:18:13,932
And what is wrong with Toula
going to school downtown?

216
00:18:14,057 --> 00:18:15,767
They use drugs downtown.

217
00:18:15,851 --> 00:18:19,688
What are you saying? Are you saying
that Toula will get involved with drugs?

218
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:22,649
No, but somebody will say to her:

219
00:18:23,108 --> 00:18:26,778
"Take this bag down to the bus depot,"
and she'll do it.

220
00:18:27,154 --> 00:18:29,531
She's not stupid. She's smart.

221
00:18:30,032 --> 00:18:33,494
I know she's smart,
so what for she needs more school?

222
00:18:33,577 --> 00:18:35,829
She's smart enough for a girl.

223
00:18:36,788 --> 00:18:39,124
You think you're smarter than me?

224
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,919
No, I mean, you know--

225
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,879
What? What do you mean?

226
00:18:44,004 --> 00:18:47,591
I run the restaurant, I cook, I clean...

227
00:18:47,841 --> 00:18:51,011
I wash for you, and I raised three kids...

228
00:18:51,428 --> 00:18:53,639
and I teach Sunday school.

229
00:18:54,097 --> 00:18:58,143
You know, it's lucky for me
I have you to tie my shoes.

230
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,939
Maria....

231
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,769
-Is this seat taken?
-Sure.

232
00:20:27,274 --> 00:20:28,400
Hi.

233
00:21:04,561 --> 00:21:06,980
That's what I want to talk to you about.

234
00:21:10,651 --> 00:21:13,070
-Look at you. What are you talking about?
-What?

235
00:21:13,362 --> 00:21:15,572
I don't like my butt. Taki likes it.

236
00:21:16,615 --> 00:21:20,410
I won't pretend the travel industry
is something I've always wanted to do.

237
00:21:20,452 --> 00:21:24,331
I'm not gonna pretend that,
but I'm saying that it's different.

238
00:21:24,331 --> 00:21:26,500
You know I've been learning
about computers?

239
00:21:26,542 --> 00:21:28,502
There's this course, a seminar.

240
00:21:28,544 --> 00:21:30,671
It's all about computers and tourism.

241
00:21:30,671 --> 00:21:33,090
There are all the latest applications
and programs.

242
00:21:33,131 --> 00:21:36,844
I could apply it here, Thia.
And your business would double or triple.

243
00:21:36,969 --> 00:21:39,721
You could be with Thio more,
and you could take a vacation.

244
00:21:39,805 --> 00:21:42,349
I could book it for you.
But, Thia, would you hire me?

245
00:21:45,352 --> 00:21:46,645
Of course.

246
00:21:47,479 --> 00:21:48,814
My God!

247
00:21:57,614 --> 00:22:01,869
We must let Kosta think this was his idea,
that he came up with it.

248
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,954
-Ma, he'll figure it out.
-Don't worry.

249
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:06,832
-I know what to do.
-You don't know what to do, you talk.

250
00:22:06,957 --> 00:22:10,502
Do you want my help? Tell me what to say,
but don't tell me what to say.

251
00:22:10,544 --> 00:22:12,462
-Perfect.
-That's good.

252
00:22:16,884 --> 00:22:19,469
So, Voula. How is business?

253
00:22:20,971 --> 00:22:23,557
Woe to me. Business is bad.

254
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:28,520
What's the matter? What happened?
Do you need money?

255
00:22:29,354 --> 00:22:33,358
No, what she means is that,
with the two businesses, she suffers.

256
00:22:34,484 --> 00:22:39,239
She suffers. She has to be
at the travel agency alone, all day...

257
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:44,119
because everybody else needs to be
working at the big dry-cleaning store.

258
00:22:44,161 --> 00:22:47,748
That's right.
I make Taki go to the dry-cleaner store...

259
00:22:48,081 --> 00:22:51,251
and now I have no time with him.

260
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:55,297
So, send Angelo or Nikki...

261
00:22:55,464 --> 00:22:59,092
to the travel agency,
you be with Taki at the dry cleaner.

262
00:23:02,262 --> 00:23:05,182
-That would be good.
-That would be no good.

263
00:23:07,017 --> 00:23:08,519
Because...

264
00:23:08,769 --> 00:23:12,564
neither Angelo nor Nikki
know how to use the computer.

265
00:23:12,648 --> 00:23:14,233
That's why that no work.

266
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:17,861
Computer?

267
00:23:22,157 --> 00:23:23,909
I have your answer.

268
00:23:25,661 --> 00:23:28,789
Toula will go to the travel agency...

269
00:23:28,831 --> 00:23:31,500
and you send Nikki here to work for us.

270
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:36,129
I can't believe this.

271
00:23:36,213 --> 00:23:37,172
Wonderful.

272
00:23:39,091 --> 00:23:40,801
You see, a man....

273
00:23:41,593 --> 00:23:45,222
You're just so smart, I love you.

274
00:23:46,139 --> 00:23:46,849
Bravo!

275
00:23:46,849 --> 00:23:47,641
Bravo!

276
00:23:50,477 --> 00:23:52,938
Hello, Mrs. Christakis. Thanks for holding.

277
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:56,191
Okay, your request pulled up "confirmed,"
so it is now PNR'd.

278
00:23:56,441 --> 00:24:01,238
Hold again, please. Hi, British Airways.
I'm gonna need a hard tick on that one.

279
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:05,951
Reading, Alpha, Bravo, Foxtrot, Charlie.
Roger, copy that.

280
00:24:05,993 --> 00:24:09,037
Hi, Mrs. Christakis,
your tickets are now in the mail...

281
00:24:09,121 --> 00:24:12,040
under "Doreen Christakis."
Okay, thank you, bye-bye.

282
00:25:02,883 --> 00:25:04,718
Come on down!

283
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,970
You're the next contestant
on The Price is Right!

284
00:25:10,349 --> 00:25:11,600
I got it.

285
00:25:18,732 --> 00:25:20,400
Did you lose this?

286
00:25:24,321 --> 00:25:28,534
Oh, Mrs. White. You find my mama again.

287
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:33,831
You know, she come from Greece,
the country I come from, too.

288
00:25:33,914 --> 00:25:35,791
For God's sake, I know.

289
00:25:36,124 --> 00:25:38,877
Listen, keep your mother off my lawn...

290
00:25:38,961 --> 00:25:41,797
out of my basement and away from my roof.

291
00:25:42,381 --> 00:25:45,884
Mrs. White, come on.
Give me a word, any word...

292
00:25:46,301 --> 00:25:49,513
and I'll show you
that the root of that word...

293
00:25:51,682 --> 00:25:52,933
is Greek.

294
00:25:54,101 --> 00:25:57,271
Look, everybody. Look who's back again.

295
00:25:59,648 --> 00:26:02,651
Sit down, Yiayia. Very good.

296
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,154
Toula, there are two kinds of people...

297
00:26:06,363 --> 00:26:09,700
Greeks, and everybody else
who wish they were Greek.

298
00:26:09,908 --> 00:26:12,327
Okay. Yes, we know.

299
00:26:14,454 --> 00:26:16,331
What's the matter with her?

300
00:26:54,244 --> 00:26:56,914
Hi, Mount Olympus Travel Agency.
May I help you?

301
00:26:57,331 --> 00:26:59,458
Sure. That's what we do.

302
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,837
What are you doing? Wait!

303
00:27:03,921 --> 00:27:05,839
Absolutely. Right.

304
00:27:06,089 --> 00:27:07,382
Sorry, lady.

305
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:14,473
Sure.

306
00:27:14,598 --> 00:27:16,308
You can book it now.

307
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:19,520
I could reserve the seat for you.
Be with you in a second.

308
00:27:19,603 --> 00:27:23,690
That would be no problem.
Call me back when you're ready. Bye-bye.

309
00:27:27,402 --> 00:27:28,487
Hi.

310
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,240
Hi.

311
00:27:36,954 --> 00:27:39,373
Did you wanna see some brochures?

312
00:27:43,085 --> 00:27:44,211
Found them.

313
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,760
Look at this.

314
00:27:54,137 --> 00:27:57,975
And then, whoosh, you were gone.
I thought you'd fainted.

315
00:27:59,351 --> 00:28:00,477
Okay.

316
00:28:00,978 --> 00:28:01,979
Yeah.

317
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:06,608
I was swept off of my feet by
your very cool opening line of "hi."

318
00:28:12,698 --> 00:28:13,991
So, Toula?

319
00:28:15,868 --> 00:28:16,910
Ian.

320
00:28:17,744 --> 00:28:19,121
Ian Miller.

321
00:28:20,831 --> 00:28:22,875
Toula Porkipakos?

322
00:28:24,209 --> 00:28:25,544
Portokalos.

323
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,131
-Okay, Toula.
-All right, then.

324
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:38,390
Was that a biker fight or a nose job?

325
00:28:41,518 --> 00:28:42,519
Yeah.

326
00:28:43,437 --> 00:28:44,730
No, really.

327
00:28:45,147 --> 00:28:46,481
You don't wanna know.

328
00:28:47,524 --> 00:28:52,279
I don't know about that. If I'd survived
an old-lady ass-kicking, I'd brag about it.

329
00:28:56,325 --> 00:28:58,660
Hey, Jesus! Ouch!

330
00:29:00,454 --> 00:29:03,040
-You want to have dinner with me?
-Yeah.

331
00:29:07,294 --> 00:29:10,464
Actually, I wasn't in education first,
I was prelaw.

332
00:29:10,631 --> 00:29:14,301
My dad's a lawyer and
my grandfather is a lawyer and...

333
00:29:15,928 --> 00:29:19,223
it just wasn't for me,
so I picked a new major.

334
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:22,100
The parents weren't too pleased, you know?

335
00:29:22,184 --> 00:29:23,310
Yeah.

336
00:29:25,229 --> 00:29:26,730
I think it....

337
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,193
I think it takes
a pretty strong person to do that.

338
00:29:32,653 --> 00:29:35,113
Well, you know everything about me, then...

339
00:29:35,197 --> 00:29:37,783
I'm a pretty strong, vegetarian teacher...

340
00:29:38,492 --> 00:29:40,327
over at Lincoln Park.

341
00:29:41,662 --> 00:29:45,040
I don't know anything about you,
except you're Greek.

342
00:29:46,834 --> 00:29:47,793
Hey...

343
00:29:49,002 --> 00:29:51,380
would you like to go have Greek food?

344
00:29:52,047 --> 00:29:53,215
No, that's okay.

345
00:29:53,423 --> 00:29:57,970
No, listen. I know this really great place,
you probably know it, Zorba's something.

346
00:29:59,179 --> 00:30:02,099
Anyway, I'd like to take you there,
if you'd like to go.

347
00:30:03,058 --> 00:30:06,019
-I don't wanna go there.
-What do you mean? Why not?

348
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:12,734
That place...

349
00:30:13,694 --> 00:30:15,237
Dancing Zorba's.

350
00:30:15,362 --> 00:30:16,655
Dancing Zorba's.

351
00:30:17,865 --> 00:30:20,033
My family owns that restaurant.

352
00:30:23,245 --> 00:30:24,288
Really?

353
00:30:32,713 --> 00:30:34,131
I remember you.

354
00:30:37,301 --> 00:30:38,677
You're that waitress.

355
00:30:40,971 --> 00:30:43,891
Seating hostess, actually.

356
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,435
I remember you.

357
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:49,521
I was kind of going through a phase...

358
00:30:50,522 --> 00:30:53,233
up until now.

359
00:30:53,859 --> 00:30:54,860
And...

360
00:30:57,154 --> 00:30:58,739
I was Frump Girl.

361
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:02,201
I don't remember Frump Girl,
but I remember you.

362
00:31:06,038 --> 00:31:09,333
Okay, no Greek. Italian? Tomorrow night?

363
00:31:11,752 --> 00:31:12,878
Okay.

364
00:31:16,089 --> 00:31:17,382
Where are you going?

365
00:31:19,801 --> 00:31:21,553
I'm taking a pottery class.

366
00:31:22,971 --> 00:31:24,723
The Greeks invented pottery.

367
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,290
So, it was just me, all alone...

368
00:31:50,332 --> 00:31:53,877
up in the mountains in this cottage,
with my parents, all summer.

369
00:31:54,253 --> 00:31:56,713
Well, don't all your cousins go up, too?

370
00:31:58,423 --> 00:31:59,383
No!

371
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,970
I only have two cousins.
They live in Wisconsin.

372
00:32:03,971 --> 00:32:06,098
-You only have two cousins?
-Yeah.

373
00:32:07,057 --> 00:32:09,309
-How many do you have?
-More than two.

374
00:32:10,811 --> 00:32:12,020
Well, who else?

375
00:32:12,354 --> 00:32:15,983
Didn't you have brothers and sisters?
What are your parents like?

376
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:19,903
What?

377
00:32:21,321 --> 00:32:22,447
Well....

378
00:32:24,741 --> 00:32:27,411
Okay, Christmas.

379
00:32:27,494 --> 00:32:29,830
What do you do for Christmas
with your family?

380
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:32,040
My mom makes roast lamb.

381
00:32:33,667 --> 00:32:35,711
-With mint jelly?
-No.

382
00:32:38,922 --> 00:32:40,299
And?

383
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,135
And....

384
00:32:49,433 --> 00:32:51,351
-I'm Greek, right?
-Right.

385
00:32:51,435 --> 00:32:53,979
So what happens is my dad and my uncles...

386
00:32:54,021 --> 00:32:56,398
fight over who gets to eat the lamb brain.

387
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,818
And them my Aunt Voula forks the eyeball,
and chases me around...

388
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:02,529
trying to make me eat it,
because it'll make me smart.

389
00:33:02,571 --> 00:33:05,324
You have two cousins.
I have 27 first cousins.

390
00:33:05,407 --> 00:33:07,409
Just 27 first cousins, alone.

391
00:33:07,451 --> 00:33:10,204
And my whole family is big and loud...

392
00:33:10,329 --> 00:33:13,165
and everybody's always
in each other's lives and business.

393
00:33:13,248 --> 00:33:17,753
You never have a minute alone to just think,
because we're always together eating.

394
00:33:18,045 --> 00:33:20,380
The only other people we know are Greeks...

395
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:22,925
because Greeks marry Greeks,
to breed more Greeks...

396
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:24,968
to be loud, breeding, Greek eaters.

397
00:33:26,887 --> 00:33:28,972
-Wow.
-I'm serious.

398
00:33:29,097 --> 00:33:33,101
No one in my family has ever
gone out with a non-Greek before. No one.

399
00:33:35,687 --> 00:33:36,688
And you're....

400
00:33:39,107 --> 00:33:40,108
You're....

401
00:33:40,484 --> 00:33:43,320
God, you're just, you know, wonderful.

402
00:33:46,698 --> 00:33:49,243
But I just don't see
how this is going to work out.

403
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:51,662
So....

404
00:33:52,329 --> 00:33:55,040
Work out? What's to work out?

405
00:33:55,541 --> 00:33:57,251
We're not a different species.

406
00:33:58,043 --> 00:34:00,587
Yes, we come from different backgrounds...

407
00:34:00,921 --> 00:34:04,758
and, hey, here's some news
about my life, to this point.

408
00:34:05,008 --> 00:34:06,260
It's boring.

409
00:34:07,094 --> 00:34:08,470
Then I met you...

410
00:34:09,304 --> 00:34:12,391
and you're interesting,
and you're beautiful and fun.

411
00:34:13,433 --> 00:34:15,561
You've got a weird family. Who doesn't?

412
00:34:22,317 --> 00:34:24,403
I just want to spend some time with you.

413
00:34:27,281 --> 00:34:29,449
I just want to spend a little time with you.

414
00:34:32,578 --> 00:34:34,121
Did you say I'm beautiful?

415
00:35:06,028 --> 00:35:07,029
Yes.

416
00:35:22,294 --> 00:35:23,587
Which house is yours?

417
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:25,589
This is good, actually.

418
00:35:25,631 --> 00:35:26,840
-Can you stop?
-Sure.

419
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:29,134
Right here is good. Just stop.

420
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,011
Thanks.

421
00:35:50,989 --> 00:35:52,282
Good night.

422
00:36:25,941 --> 00:36:27,192
Good night.

423
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:45,711
-Okay, good night.
-What?

424
00:36:46,628 --> 00:36:48,130
No, don't go.

425
00:36:58,974 --> 00:37:00,100
Good night.

426
00:37:00,893 --> 00:37:01,852
Don't go.

427
00:37:30,631 --> 00:37:33,300
And I can make a man out of you

428
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,844
'Cause I'm a woman

429
00:37:36,303 --> 00:37:39,431
W-O-M-A-N

430
00:37:40,682 --> 00:37:43,185
Happy again today, Toula?

431
00:37:44,144 --> 00:37:45,103
Yeah.

432
00:37:45,354 --> 00:37:48,315
Now every time I see you,
you have a great big smile.

433
00:37:49,441 --> 00:37:51,318
-Hi, Ma.
-Hey, Niko.

434
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,820
-Where'd you go?
-Nowhere.

435
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:54,530
-What did you do?
-Nothing.

436
00:37:54,613 --> 00:37:56,198
-Who did you see?
-No one.

437
00:37:56,281 --> 00:37:59,243
Wait a minute, Niko,
I put them in your room.

438
00:37:59,409 --> 00:38:03,330
Toula, how was your class?

439
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,999
My pottery class?

440
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,461
-It's great.
-Good.

441
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:31,441
-You've got to get out of here.
-Just one more kiss, then I'll go.

442
00:38:32,317 --> 00:38:33,318
No.

443
00:38:39,408 --> 00:38:41,535
What is going on?

444
00:38:43,203 --> 00:38:46,039
Mr. Pottery Class, nice to meet you.

445
00:38:48,917 --> 00:38:50,752
Ian, this is my cousin, Nikki.

446
00:38:51,628 --> 00:38:53,380
Hello!

447
00:38:53,922 --> 00:38:56,675
It's nice to finally meet
a member of Toula's family.

448
00:38:56,758 --> 00:38:58,302
Yeah, well....

449
00:39:03,682 --> 00:39:07,019
I'm the least of your worries.
Listen, the family knows.

450
00:39:07,561 --> 00:39:10,564
Last night, Vicki Pavalopolis
saw you sucking the lips...

451
00:39:10,689 --> 00:39:12,691
off his head, in the Denny's parking lot.

452
00:39:12,774 --> 00:39:16,737
She told her ma, who told my ma,
who told your ma....

453
00:39:16,862 --> 00:39:18,989
Let me put it this way. You're busted.

454
00:39:19,031 --> 00:39:21,074
You sneak around, all over Chicago...

455
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,120
but you never come here to ask me,
can you date my daughter.

456
00:39:26,914 --> 00:39:29,750
I'm sorry, but to ask you
if I can date your daughter....

457
00:39:29,833 --> 00:39:31,460
Sir, she's 30 years old.

458
00:39:31,543 --> 00:39:33,921
I am the head of this house!

459
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:39,051
Okay, may I please date your daughter?

460
00:39:41,094 --> 00:39:42,262
No!

461
00:39:48,477 --> 00:39:50,771
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-See you tomorrow.

462
00:39:53,607 --> 00:39:54,525
Excuse me.

463
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:04,618
Didn't I say it's a mistake...

464
00:40:05,327 --> 00:40:06,954
to educate women?

465
00:40:07,788 --> 00:40:11,124
But nobody listened to me.

466
00:40:11,583 --> 00:40:15,504
Now we have a boyfriend in the house.

467
00:40:15,671 --> 00:40:18,507
Is he a nice Greek boy?

468
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:21,009
No, no Greek.

469
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:23,470
No Greek! A xeno!

470
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:26,890
A xeno with a big long hairs...

471
00:40:26,932 --> 00:40:29,768
-on top of his head!
-Kosta.

472
00:40:37,317 --> 00:40:38,944
I'm sorry I lied to you.

473
00:40:50,372 --> 00:40:51,790
Okay, Toula...

474
00:40:52,541 --> 00:40:55,043
maybe you are having a little romance.

475
00:40:58,672 --> 00:41:00,132
But end it now.

476
00:41:04,011 --> 00:41:05,179
I love him.

477
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,557
Toula, eat something...

478
00:41:09,474 --> 00:41:10,767
please.

479
00:41:21,778 --> 00:41:24,031
Your father has a friend for dinner.

480
00:42:05,072 --> 00:42:06,698
What's this? Where are we?

481
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:09,660
My apartment.

482
00:42:11,078 --> 00:42:12,621
You wanna go up?

483
00:42:52,244 --> 00:42:53,245
This is it.

484
00:43:55,641 --> 00:43:58,101
Don't worry, they're gonna love you.

485
00:44:03,774 --> 00:44:07,361
"Toula." Now that's not a name
you hear every day.

486
00:44:07,444 --> 00:44:10,197
Does it mean anything in your language?

487
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:14,201
Well, my Greek name, Fotoula,
means "Light of God."

488
00:44:17,037 --> 00:44:18,997
Who would like a coffee?

489
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:23,710
So, you're Greek then?

490
00:44:23,919 --> 00:44:26,004
What's your last name?

491
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:27,464
Portokalos.

492
00:44:28,215 --> 00:44:29,758
In Greek, it means "orange."

493
00:44:30,259 --> 00:44:34,930
Like an orange that you eat,
the one with the peel, not the color.

494
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:39,852
Yeah, it's really Greek.

495
00:44:41,019 --> 00:44:44,398
Rodney, didn't you once have
a Greek receptionist?

496
00:44:45,357 --> 00:44:48,110
No, Harriet, she was....

497
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:53,240
-Just a minute.
-No, she was Armenian.

498
00:44:53,907 --> 00:44:57,077
-Is Armenia close to Greece?
-Not exactly.

499
00:44:57,619 --> 00:44:58,912
-What was she?
-Who?

500
00:44:59,204 --> 00:45:01,039
My secretary, for heaven's sake.

501
00:45:01,582 --> 00:45:03,083
Everyone like cheesecake?

502
00:45:04,459 --> 00:45:08,380
-Guatemalan.
-That's right, dear. She was Guatemalan.

503
00:45:39,161 --> 00:45:40,287
I love you.

504
00:45:42,623 --> 00:45:44,041
I love you.

505
00:45:52,341 --> 00:45:53,800
I don't....

506
00:45:55,677 --> 00:45:57,471
I don't really know how to say this.

507
00:45:58,722 --> 00:45:59,765
What?

508
00:46:04,144 --> 00:46:05,437
Will you marry me?

509
00:46:07,981 --> 00:46:09,149
Yes!

510
00:46:15,197 --> 00:46:17,491
I guess, now you can have this.

511
00:46:21,495 --> 00:46:22,955
Come here.

512
00:47:03,245 --> 00:47:04,329
Enough.

513
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:12,921
What? Don't you walk away from me.
Sit down.

514
00:47:19,928 --> 00:47:20,888
Kosta...

515
00:47:22,014 --> 00:47:25,100
they love each other. It's done.

516
00:47:26,393 --> 00:47:27,394
How?

517
00:47:28,061 --> 00:47:31,648
How can she do this to me?

518
00:47:32,483 --> 00:47:35,402
She didn't do this to you or to me.

519
00:47:36,403 --> 00:47:39,114
They fell in love. It happens.

520
00:47:40,282 --> 00:47:42,910
Is he a good boy? I don't know.

521
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:47,623
Is he from a good family? I don't know.

522
00:47:48,957 --> 00:47:52,002
Is he respectful? I don't know...

523
00:47:52,878 --> 00:47:56,131
because nobody talks to me
about nothing no more.

524
00:47:56,590 --> 00:48:00,511
A respectful boy would come here
and ask for my permission.

525
00:48:01,595 --> 00:48:04,723
My daughter engaged to a xeno.

526
00:48:05,224 --> 00:48:09,561
I always think she's going to be married
in the Greek Orthodox Church.

527
00:48:10,354 --> 00:48:12,564
Why is she doing this to me?

528
00:48:19,071 --> 00:48:22,407
...and leave space.
Sometimes their space is so big...

529
00:48:22,491 --> 00:48:25,244
that the roof can't support itself,
so it collapses.

530
00:48:31,458 --> 00:48:32,417
Excuse me.

531
00:48:33,877 --> 00:48:35,504
Try not to be too loud.

532
00:48:41,552 --> 00:48:42,553
Hi.

533
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:45,848
-Hi.
-Hi.

534
00:48:47,474 --> 00:48:49,184
What's going on?

535
00:48:51,353 --> 00:48:53,188
-Are you okay?
-Can we go to Vegas?

536
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:54,231
What?

537
00:48:54,314 --> 00:48:57,651
Can we go to Niagara Falls or Fiji....
You want to go to Fiji?

538
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:58,861
Sure.

539
00:48:59,111 --> 00:49:01,155
Okay, let's go. Come on.

540
00:49:03,031 --> 00:49:04,032
Come here.

541
00:49:04,825 --> 00:49:05,951
What's the matter?

542
00:49:08,662 --> 00:49:12,499
I just feel like we can't get married,
not like this.

543
00:49:13,959 --> 00:49:14,960
It's like...

544
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:17,421
when I'm with you...

545
00:49:17,504 --> 00:49:19,673
I am so happy...

546
00:49:20,632 --> 00:49:23,051
but my family is so unhappy.

547
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:25,929
And our wedding should be
this joyous thing.

548
00:49:25,971 --> 00:49:28,891
But it won't be for them,
because it can't be in our church.

549
00:49:28,932 --> 00:49:32,853
So, let's just go somewhere.
Please, let's just go.

550
00:49:34,021 --> 00:49:36,690
Hey, I love you.

551
00:49:37,399 --> 00:49:38,650
Why?

552
00:49:39,443 --> 00:49:41,111
Why do you love me?

553
00:49:42,321 --> 00:49:44,698
Because I came alive when I met you.

554
00:49:46,533 --> 00:49:47,993
But my family....

555
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,039
You're a part of your family...

556
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:55,459
and I'll do anything...

557
00:49:56,877 --> 00:49:59,338
whatever it takes, to get them to accept me.

558
00:50:00,589 --> 00:50:03,258
Because you're my whole life now.

559
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,970
We're not going to skulk off
and get married...

560
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:09,389
as if we're ashamed of ourselves.

561
00:50:10,933 --> 00:50:11,934
Okay?

562
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:14,520
Okay.

563
00:50:17,189 --> 00:50:18,398
Did you say "skulk"?

564
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:21,610
-Shut up.
-Let's just skulk off somewhere....

565
00:50:25,364 --> 00:50:26,573
Come on, talk to him.

566
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:28,534
Toula loves him.

567
00:50:28,742 --> 00:50:30,619
Do it for Toula, come on.

568
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:34,540
Come on.
He wants to get married in the church.

569
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:36,375
-Go!
-All right.

570
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:50,222
So, you're going to be baptized tomorrow?

571
00:50:57,479 --> 00:50:58,939
It's your lucky day...

572
00:50:58,981 --> 00:51:02,401
to be baptized
in the Greek Orthodox Church.

573
00:51:04,194 --> 00:51:06,530
Nikki's going to be your godmother.

574
00:51:10,617 --> 00:51:11,535
You know...

575
00:51:12,452 --> 00:51:14,288
the word "baptism"...

576
00:51:15,330 --> 00:51:18,834
comes from the Greek word "baftisia. "

577
00:51:19,001 --> 00:51:20,794
That's where we dip the baby...

578
00:51:20,919 --> 00:51:24,131
in a beautiful, little silver basin.

579
00:52:00,167 --> 00:52:01,919
It's not so bad?

580
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:05,380
Are you kidding? Any minute now,
he's going to look at me and go:

581
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:07,674
"Right, you're so not worth this."

582
00:52:09,593 --> 00:52:10,802
Yes, you are.

583
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:31,031
You're all oily.

584
00:52:32,783 --> 00:52:34,117
I'm Greek, now.

585
00:52:35,994 --> 00:52:37,454
Thank you so much.

586
00:52:49,550 --> 00:52:52,845
So, for "Happy Easter,"
we say "Khristos Anesti."

587
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:55,389
Then the other person says back,
"Alithos Anesti."

588
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:59,560
So if you want to say "Happy Easter,"
you go, "Khristos Anesti." So try it.

589
00:53:02,062 --> 00:53:03,021
That's good.

590
00:53:07,442 --> 00:53:08,443
Hey, Dad.

591
00:53:13,657 --> 00:53:16,118
Mr. Portokalos, Khristos Anesti.

592
00:53:24,001 --> 00:53:25,502
-He likes you.
-Yes?

593
00:53:26,128 --> 00:53:28,130
I told you to watch the boys.

594
00:53:28,213 --> 00:53:30,799
They'll be fine with the video games.

595
00:53:30,841 --> 00:53:34,261
-You turn their brains to mush.
-I can't do anything right.

596
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:38,223
Ian, if you're going to be in this family,
I'll get you some earplugs...

597
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:41,894
because the Portokalos women,
if they're not nagging somebody, they die!

598
00:53:42,769 --> 00:53:46,690
-You're in trouble when I tell my sister.
-Tell me what?

599
00:53:50,194 --> 00:53:51,820
Where is he?

600
00:53:52,738 --> 00:53:54,948
Khristos Anesti.

601
00:53:56,950 --> 00:53:59,119
Alithos Anesti, Thia.

602
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:01,163
Toula, you're engaged!

603
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:04,124
We never think it would happen for you.
Never.

604
00:54:05,542 --> 00:54:08,629
-Taki, didn't we say that?
-We never think this day will come.

605
00:54:09,171 --> 00:54:11,798
-And it came!
-Is this him?

606
00:54:12,549 --> 00:54:14,384
Yes, sorry. Everyone, this is Ian.

607
00:54:14,510 --> 00:54:16,428
Ian!

608
00:54:53,799 --> 00:54:55,050
Hello, Ian.

609
00:55:14,194 --> 00:55:15,988
I want to see the rock.

610
00:55:20,701 --> 00:55:21,994
-Hey, Ian.
-Hey.

611
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:24,079
-You like that dance?
-Yeah.

612
00:55:24,121 --> 00:55:26,790
Okay, Jennie has something
she wants to ask you.

613
00:55:26,874 --> 00:55:28,333
-No, she doesn't.
-Go on.

614
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:29,710
Jennie, just ask me.

615
00:55:29,918 --> 00:55:31,420
Does he have any brothers?

616
00:55:31,879 --> 00:55:33,672
No, he's an only child.

617
00:55:33,797 --> 00:55:37,009
I've got to tell you,
I've never seen my sister so happy.

618
00:55:38,552 --> 00:55:41,680
If you hurt her, I'll kill you
and make it look like an accident.

619
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:46,393
Jesus, look at your face. It's just a joke.

620
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:47,769
Good one.

621
00:55:47,978 --> 00:55:50,814
No, the good one is, "I've got a gun."
Yeah, I've got a gun...

622
00:55:50,939 --> 00:55:52,774
and I swear, I'll jam it up your....

623
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:54,568
Ian, I got you again!

624
00:55:55,569 --> 00:55:58,280
-Here, eat some rice.
-I don't want any rice, I'm good.

625
00:55:58,447 --> 00:56:00,824
No, "I'm good."
I could snap you like a chicken!

626
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,368
Come on, lighten up.

627
00:56:03,619 --> 00:56:06,580
I'll lighten you when I take out your kidneys.

628
00:56:08,499 --> 00:56:09,958
One more time, Ian.

629
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:13,504
-Hey, Angelo.
-Hey, Ian, we're going to kill you!

630
00:56:41,323 --> 00:56:43,075
Ian, Aunt Voula.

631
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:45,118
Let me touch your hair.

632
00:56:49,832 --> 00:56:52,000
-Okay, Thia Voula?
-No.

633
00:56:52,084 --> 00:56:53,252
-Thia Voula?
-Yes?

634
00:56:55,462 --> 00:56:58,090
When you come to my house
and I cook for you?

635
00:56:58,173 --> 00:57:00,592
-Okay.
-Thia, that might be a problem.

636
00:57:00,717 --> 00:57:03,178
Problem? I'm the best cook
in the family. Tell him.

637
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:05,097
-I did, didn't l?
-Twice.

638
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:06,390
Okay, then.

639
00:57:07,891 --> 00:57:09,309
It's just....

640
00:57:10,144 --> 00:57:11,103
Yeah?

641
00:57:11,812 --> 00:57:13,730
Ian is a vegetarian.

642
00:57:14,231 --> 00:57:15,649
He doesn't eat meat.

643
00:57:17,401 --> 00:57:18,694
He don't eat no meat?

644
00:57:19,153 --> 00:57:20,612
No, he doesn't eat meat.

645
00:57:20,654 --> 00:57:22,990
What do you mean, "He don't eat no meat"?

646
00:57:26,743 --> 00:57:29,371
That's okay, I'll make lamb.

647
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:30,664
Come.

648
00:57:31,290 --> 00:57:33,000
Come and dance.

649
00:58:06,408 --> 00:58:07,367
Silence.

650
00:58:10,621 --> 00:58:11,872
It's delicious.

651
00:58:14,541 --> 00:58:18,170
We took a look at my calendar,
our calendar...

652
00:58:18,754 --> 00:58:21,757
to set a day for the big day...

653
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:25,010
sometime at the end of October,
mid-November?

654
00:58:25,052 --> 00:58:27,763
-Sometime in there, yeah.
-Wonderful.

655
00:58:27,888 --> 00:58:30,349
I'll call the Club and see what's open.

656
00:58:30,891 --> 00:58:32,017
The Club?

657
00:58:32,351 --> 00:58:35,229
The North Shore Country Club,
for the wedding, of course.

658
00:58:36,188 --> 00:58:38,690
We're going to get married
in Toula's church...

659
00:58:38,774 --> 00:58:41,568
because we're not very religious,
and her family is.

660
00:58:41,819 --> 00:58:44,321
Really is. Show them the brochure.

661
00:58:45,113 --> 00:58:46,615
Oh, that. Yeah.

662
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:53,622
My cousin Nikki made me this.

663
00:58:53,747 --> 00:58:56,542
She tends to save things.
This is from her prom.

664
00:58:57,084 --> 00:58:58,877
She makes lamps and....

665
00:58:59,127 --> 00:59:01,880
Tell them about, we got this great big hall....

666
00:59:02,130 --> 00:59:05,551
-What's it called, for the reception?
-Aphrodite's Palace.

667
00:59:05,592 --> 00:59:07,261
It's not really a palace.

668
00:59:09,471 --> 00:59:10,681
This is a brochure.

669
00:59:15,352 --> 00:59:18,272
That Parthenon backdrop is optional.

670
00:59:21,942 --> 00:59:25,237
Yes, smarty, if we invite Makopouloses...

671
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:28,448
we have to invite Adamopouloses!
They're cousins!

672
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:34,288
Dad, the thing is
that we just want to keep it small.

673
00:59:34,329 --> 00:59:37,791
It's like you'd rather go bankrupt
than insult anyone from the church.

674
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,084
Toula...

675
00:59:39,543 --> 00:59:43,922
I come to this country
with $8 in my pocket...

676
00:59:44,339 --> 00:59:46,675
to make all this for you.

677
00:59:47,342 --> 00:59:48,343
And...

678
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:53,348
who knows how long I'm going to be alive?

679
00:59:55,601 --> 00:59:57,060
Let me see the list.

680
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:02,107
Okay, come on. Time out!

681
01:00:02,691 --> 01:00:04,818
No more punching Thio Niko's nads, okay?

682
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:06,862
Foti, stop hitting Thio Niko.

683
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:09,573
Look at you, how big you are!

684
01:00:12,367 --> 01:00:14,703
Boys, come on, soccer practice. Let's go.

685
01:00:14,828 --> 01:00:17,873
-Did she spit on him?
-Now go on, go outside with your father.

686
01:00:17,998 --> 01:00:21,168
Yeah, for good luck. Keeps the devil away.

687
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:23,670
Bye. Wait for me.

688
01:00:25,130 --> 01:00:26,173
Dad.

689
01:00:29,343 --> 01:00:30,761
Where did you get that?

690
01:00:31,303 --> 01:00:33,722
I drew it, Dad, for the new menu.
Remember?

691
01:00:38,602 --> 01:00:39,770
Ma, I'm hungry.

692
01:00:40,187 --> 01:00:41,563
Okay, Niko.

693
01:00:42,022 --> 01:00:43,690
Ian, are you hungry?

694
01:00:43,941 --> 01:00:46,777
-No, I already ate.
-Okay, I'll make you something.

695
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:48,904
Okay.

696
01:00:49,530 --> 01:00:52,991
Now, Toula,
we have to have Tommy Kasimatis.

697
01:00:55,369 --> 01:00:57,162
Hey, let me help you with those.

698
01:00:57,287 --> 01:01:00,123
-What is wrong with Tommy Kasimatis?
-I don't know them.

699
01:01:00,249 --> 01:01:03,252
-Who cares? They're related to me.
-Why are you being so weird?

700
01:01:03,335 --> 01:01:06,505
-I'm not being weird.
-You're weird when you're pregnant.

701
01:01:12,928 --> 01:01:14,471
Ian, eat.

702
01:01:17,391 --> 01:01:19,434
How do you say "thank you" in Greek?

703
01:01:22,688 --> 01:01:24,523
That's it. You got it.

704
01:01:39,872 --> 01:01:41,081
-Hey, Toula!
-Yeah?

705
01:01:41,290 --> 01:01:44,168
Listen, I got the greatest connection
for your invitations.

706
01:01:44,459 --> 01:01:46,879
No, we're gonna order
our own invitations, okay?

707
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:49,631
I don't want something
your cash-only connection gets...

708
01:01:49,715 --> 01:01:51,133
that falls off of a truck.

709
01:01:51,258 --> 01:01:54,678
-Yeah, but they come through, right?
-For God's sake, let the man talk.

710
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:57,181
-Why are you always so stubborn?
-I'm not stubborn--

711
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:02,352
Girls, I ordered the invitations
two weeks ago.

712
01:02:03,604 --> 01:02:06,690
-I never saw a wedding invitation.
-I'll go get them.

713
01:02:14,781 --> 01:02:16,700
Wait till you see them.

714
01:02:29,087 --> 01:02:31,423
My parents' names are Rodney and Harriet.

715
01:02:33,634 --> 01:02:34,801
"Rodney and Harry"?

716
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:41,683
I didn't notice, so I bet they won't.

717
01:02:41,809 --> 01:02:43,602
Yia sas, everybody.

718
01:02:44,311 --> 01:02:46,980
Wait. I have got the biggest scoop.

719
01:02:47,981 --> 01:02:52,402
Look at the earrings I have found
that match the bridesmaids' dresses.

720
01:02:53,028 --> 01:02:56,073
I remembered.
We have a customer at the dry cleaner's...

721
01:02:56,198 --> 01:02:58,200
who is a custom jewelry designer.

722
01:02:58,242 --> 01:03:00,244
So, I showed her the fabric.

723
01:03:00,369 --> 01:03:03,664
Wait, what do these match?
Not that fabric you showed me last week.

724
01:03:03,789 --> 01:03:06,583
-You said you liked it.
-I said I'd think about it.

725
01:03:06,917 --> 01:03:08,669
That's just because...

726
01:03:10,921 --> 01:03:13,090
you couldn't visualize it.

727
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:18,428
-You're so beautiful!
-Don't worry, you don't have to do a thing.

728
01:03:18,512 --> 01:03:19,471
That's classy.

729
01:03:21,890 --> 01:03:24,184
I went by the college and picked this up.

730
01:03:27,062 --> 01:03:28,105
Look.

731
01:03:29,690 --> 01:03:33,861
I'm gonna start slowly, you know.
Do a couple of night courses.

732
01:03:36,029 --> 01:03:40,742
I just wanted to learn more about painting
and art and stuff, so....

733
01:03:41,743 --> 01:03:43,787
This is so great.

734
01:03:44,872 --> 01:03:46,415
Yeah, you started it.

735
01:03:46,748 --> 01:03:48,750
You wanted to do something else...

736
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:51,044
and you did it.

737
01:03:53,630 --> 01:03:54,590
Hey, Toula...

738
01:03:55,674 --> 01:03:58,010
don't let your past dictate who you are...

739
01:03:58,927 --> 01:04:01,889
but let it be part of who you will become.

740
01:04:03,390 --> 01:04:05,767
Nick, that is so beautiful.

741
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:07,352
Yeah.

742
01:04:07,769 --> 01:04:11,064
That Dear Abby,
she really knows what she's talking about.

743
01:04:26,830 --> 01:04:29,249
-Hello?
-Hi, Mom, it's me.

744
01:04:30,292 --> 01:04:32,711
All right, Ian is going to pick me up...

745
01:04:32,753 --> 01:04:37,090
and then we'll get his parents,
and then we're gonna be there in one hour.

746
01:04:37,174 --> 01:04:38,342
-Good.
-Okay.

747
01:04:38,467 --> 01:04:41,428
-Is everything okay? What are you doing?
-I peel the potatoes.

748
01:04:41,470 --> 01:04:44,264
Why are you peeling potatoes?
I peeled some this morning.

749
01:04:44,389 --> 01:04:45,891
I know, but we need more.

750
01:04:46,558 --> 01:04:48,143
How much are you cooking?

751
01:04:48,352 --> 01:04:49,770
It's a lot of people.

752
01:04:50,270 --> 01:04:52,689
-There's three of them.
-And us.

753
01:04:53,023 --> 01:04:55,734
-Then that makes seven.
-And the family.

754
01:04:57,778 --> 01:05:01,448
The family? You invited the whole family?

755
01:05:01,907 --> 01:05:03,158
Of course.

756
01:05:03,784 --> 01:05:07,788
Ma, I said, "Come for a quiet dinner,
and meet my parents."

757
01:05:08,288 --> 01:05:10,833
They might as well meet
the whole family, right?

758
01:05:11,124 --> 01:05:14,211
-Maria.
-I got to go, Taki's here. Bye.

759
01:05:17,297 --> 01:05:18,507
I'm coming.

760
01:05:21,927 --> 01:05:24,805
Look at this. Bravo!

761
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:28,142
Okay, hurry, put it on the spit.

762
01:06:06,430 --> 01:06:07,931
They are here!

763
01:06:11,018 --> 01:06:12,978
Excuse me.

764
01:06:15,522 --> 01:06:17,149
Welcome to my home.

765
01:06:19,568 --> 01:06:22,321
Over here is my brother, Ted...

766
01:06:22,571 --> 01:06:27,159
and his wife, Melissa, and their children,
Anita, Diane, and Nick.

767
01:06:27,451 --> 01:06:30,871
Over here, my brother, Tommy,
his wife, Angie...

768
01:06:30,871 --> 01:06:33,832
and their children, Anita, Diane, and Nick.

769
01:06:34,041 --> 01:06:37,461
And here, my brother, George,
that's his wife, Frieda...

770
01:06:37,628 --> 01:06:40,547
and their children, Anita, Diane, and Nick.

771
01:06:40,631 --> 01:06:44,259
Taki, Sophie, Carrie, Nick, Nick, Nick...

772
01:06:48,430 --> 01:06:49,640
Nikki...

773
01:06:50,724 --> 01:06:52,684
and I am Gus.

774
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:03,737
They are here? Where? Excuse me.

775
01:07:05,781 --> 01:07:06,949
Hello.

776
01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:12,371
I am Maria Portokalos...

777
01:07:12,830 --> 01:07:15,040
and welcome to our home.

778
01:07:22,548 --> 01:07:25,259
Thank you. What is it?

779
01:07:25,551 --> 01:07:26,510
It's a bundt.

780
01:07:27,177 --> 01:07:29,221
-A "bundt"?
-Bundt.

781
01:07:43,402 --> 01:07:46,238
It's a cake! I know!

782
01:07:48,448 --> 01:07:51,160
Thank you. Thank you very much.

783
01:07:54,580 --> 01:07:56,498
There's a hole in this cake.

784
01:07:58,667 --> 01:08:00,252
These are some of my cousins.

785
01:08:00,502 --> 01:08:03,172
Hey, Ian, good to see you, man.

786
01:08:03,255 --> 01:08:07,342
Listen, I really think you should say,
"Eho tria arhidia."

787
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:09,344
It means, "Everyone, come in the house."

788
01:08:09,469 --> 01:08:11,138
Everybody will really like it.

789
01:08:12,764 --> 01:08:15,058
That's good, you've got it.

790
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:17,352
-I'm not falling for that again.
-Why?

791
01:08:17,561 --> 01:08:18,937
Yeah, why?

792
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:23,233
Angelo, how do you say,
"Everyone, let's go in the house"?

793
01:08:27,321 --> 01:08:28,447
Everyone...

794
01:08:35,913 --> 01:08:37,414
You're in so much trouble!

795
01:08:38,582 --> 01:08:42,127
This is from Mykonos, beautiful island.

796
01:08:42,669 --> 01:08:44,922
See that? That's where we're from.

797
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:47,049
You like them? I make them.

798
01:08:49,551 --> 01:08:52,387
Go, sit down. Sit. Come.

799
01:08:52,471 --> 01:08:53,430
Go. Go now.

800
01:08:54,598 --> 01:08:56,058
-Sit down.
-Thank you.

801
01:08:59,144 --> 01:09:00,687
Now you are family.

802
01:09:01,772 --> 01:09:04,233
Okay. All my life...

803
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:08,654
I had a lump at the back of my neck.
Right here. Always a lump.

804
01:09:10,113 --> 01:09:12,991
Then I started menopause,
and the lump got bigger.

805
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:15,619
From the hormones, it started to grow.

806
01:09:16,370 --> 01:09:19,665
So, I go to the doctor, and he did the...

807
01:09:20,541 --> 01:09:21,834
the bios... The....

808
01:09:22,251 --> 01:09:23,752
The bubopsy.

809
01:09:25,170 --> 01:09:28,549
Inside the lump, he found teeth...

810
01:09:29,258 --> 01:09:30,717
and a spinal cord.

811
01:09:33,303 --> 01:09:35,514
Yes, inside the lump...

812
01:09:36,223 --> 01:09:37,432
was my twin.

813
01:09:41,019 --> 01:09:43,313
Spanakopita! You hungry?

814
01:09:53,782 --> 01:09:56,660
-I love it when you speak in Greek.
-Really?

815
01:09:56,827 --> 01:09:59,204
It's sexy. Having a good time?

816
01:10:00,497 --> 01:10:01,874
All right! Come on.

817
01:10:04,168 --> 01:10:06,253
Rodney, Harry, ouzo?

818
01:10:10,841 --> 01:10:11,842
Thank you.

819
01:10:17,890 --> 01:10:19,433
It's licorice.

820
01:10:19,808 --> 01:10:21,560
It's delicious.

821
01:10:32,571 --> 01:10:35,407
Another. You're Greeks now. Don't be shy.

822
01:10:53,509 --> 01:10:55,469
Don't worry, I'll be back.

823
01:11:05,270 --> 01:11:08,148
The meat is here, everybody.

824
01:11:08,857 --> 01:11:11,151
Meat. Very good. Very good.

825
01:11:12,653 --> 01:11:15,989
You like some meat?
Some Greek meat, very good.

826
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:26,500
Red meat, everybody.

827
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:29,211
-Thank you for food, Gus.
-Real fine.

828
01:11:29,545 --> 01:11:31,505
Coming through.

829
01:11:31,630 --> 01:11:32,631
Bravo, Maria.

830
01:11:36,218 --> 01:11:39,179
And now, the bundt cake.

831
01:11:39,471 --> 01:11:40,848
You fixed it.

832
01:11:41,098 --> 01:11:42,641
I tried. You tried.

833
01:11:43,350 --> 01:11:45,769
We all nice to them, you see it.

834
01:11:45,978 --> 01:11:49,022
And they look at us like we're from the zoo.

835
01:11:52,067 --> 01:11:53,861
This no work, Maria.

836
01:11:54,278 --> 01:11:56,530
They different people.

837
01:11:57,114 --> 01:12:00,993
So dry. That family is like a piece of toast.

838
01:12:01,410 --> 01:12:04,830
No honey, no jam, just dry.

839
01:12:05,789 --> 01:12:08,000
My daughter...

840
01:12:08,083 --> 01:12:10,419
gonna marry Ian Miller.

841
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:13,922
A xeno with a toast family.

842
01:12:15,340 --> 01:12:18,218
I never think this can happen to us.

843
01:12:18,677 --> 01:12:20,679
I try to put little marmalade....

844
01:12:21,221 --> 01:12:23,682
Oh, no, they don't like.

845
01:12:24,224 --> 01:12:27,769
They like themselves, all dry and cracking.

846
01:12:38,780 --> 01:12:40,324
And in Toula's church...

847
01:12:40,449 --> 01:12:42,451
the best man is actually
part of the ceremony.

848
01:12:42,534 --> 01:12:44,578
He's got to be Greek Orthodox, so...

849
01:12:44,912 --> 01:12:48,081
I can't ask you to be my best man,
although, technically, you are.

850
01:12:49,291 --> 01:12:51,877
You were gonna ask me
to be your best man?

851
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:52,920
Yeah.

852
01:12:53,670 --> 01:12:54,880
I am touched.

853
01:12:57,090 --> 01:12:59,510
I had no idea you had so few friends.

854
01:13:03,639 --> 01:13:08,185
That's okay. Just get me a little badge
that says "best man" or something like that.

855
01:13:10,938 --> 01:13:15,234
No offence, but this girl's family's
got you by the short ones.

856
01:13:16,151 --> 01:13:19,154
They say "jump,"
and you pull out the trampoline.

857
01:13:22,574 --> 01:13:23,617
Yeah.

858
01:13:24,117 --> 01:13:25,077
Okay.

859
01:13:25,577 --> 01:13:27,204
My life is shit.

860
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:31,124
Toula's got a lot of cousins. Fix you up.

861
01:13:32,292 --> 01:13:33,752
Yeah, that's gonna happen.

862
01:13:44,930 --> 01:13:46,014
What is wrong?

863
01:13:50,102 --> 01:13:51,061
All right.

864
01:13:52,521 --> 01:13:53,981
Is my marriage killing Dad?

865
01:13:55,274 --> 01:13:57,901
Toula, your father is your father.

866
01:13:58,902 --> 01:14:00,612
He just wants you to be happy.

867
01:14:01,363 --> 01:14:02,948
But I am happy.

868
01:14:11,123 --> 01:14:12,291
Listen to me.

869
01:14:12,708 --> 01:14:15,210
My village saw many wars...

870
01:14:16,837 --> 01:14:18,839
Turkish, German...

871
01:14:19,590 --> 01:14:21,508
they all made a mess.

872
01:14:24,470 --> 01:14:26,972
And my mother, she said:

873
01:14:27,389 --> 01:14:29,641
"We're lucky to be alive."

874
01:14:30,350 --> 01:14:33,770
And I thought, "We're not lucky to be alive.

875
01:14:34,688 --> 01:14:37,274
"We're not lucky, when they are telling us...

876
01:14:37,691 --> 01:14:40,444
"where we should live, what we should eat."

877
01:14:40,903 --> 01:14:43,030
Nobody has that right.

878
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:47,409
And then, I see you.

879
01:14:48,827 --> 01:14:51,330
And I see Athena and Niko.

880
01:14:52,873 --> 01:14:54,583
We came here for you.

881
01:14:55,501 --> 01:14:58,253
So you could live.

882
01:15:00,339 --> 01:15:04,301
I gave you life, so that you could live it.

883
01:16:46,820 --> 01:16:50,157
Ma, the band needs to be picked up
at the airport.

884
01:16:58,624 --> 01:16:59,791
Surprise!

885
01:17:04,463 --> 01:17:07,049
Wait, what is that?

886
01:17:07,424 --> 01:17:08,759
No.

887
01:17:10,761 --> 01:17:12,179
My God!

888
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:19,561
Where did everybody go?

889
01:17:25,943 --> 01:17:27,444
It is a mosquito bite.

890
01:17:27,528 --> 01:17:29,154
-It's a zit.
-I have cover-up.

891
01:17:32,241 --> 01:17:34,201
Hello, ladies, fresh baklava.

892
01:17:36,370 --> 01:17:39,039
-Get out of here.
-Give me the camera.

893
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:41,250
Give me the camera.

894
01:17:41,708 --> 01:17:43,335
Toula. Help me.

895
01:17:44,962 --> 01:17:46,171
No boys allowed!

896
01:17:46,255 --> 01:17:48,340
-Nice moustache, Nikki.
-Thank you.

897
01:17:48,340 --> 01:17:49,633
Niko, let's go.

898
01:17:49,758 --> 01:17:51,552
-Dad, is that my tux?
-No, this one.

899
01:17:51,635 --> 01:17:54,138
Nick, go to the airport and pick up the band.

900
01:17:54,221 --> 01:17:55,472
Okay.

901
01:17:55,514 --> 01:17:57,307
Hey, what's that thing?

902
01:17:57,850 --> 01:17:59,184
It's a mosquito bite.

903
01:17:59,893 --> 01:18:01,061
Put some Windex.

904
01:18:02,938 --> 01:18:04,398
I've got the cover-up.

905
01:18:04,690 --> 01:18:05,899
Bravo!

906
01:18:06,191 --> 01:18:07,651
You're all nuts.

907
01:18:08,068 --> 01:18:09,903
We've got another one.

908
01:18:10,028 --> 01:18:12,990
You are supposed to get changed
at my house. Get out.

909
01:18:14,950 --> 01:18:16,410
Let me pop it!

910
01:18:19,121 --> 01:18:20,247
There she is.

911
01:18:20,330 --> 01:18:22,040
Toula, I want to talk to you.

912
01:18:22,124 --> 01:18:23,000
Now?

913
01:18:23,250 --> 01:18:25,419
This is a very special night for you.

914
01:18:26,253 --> 01:18:27,504
You have your duties.

915
01:18:27,588 --> 01:18:30,632
One more, one big one, hold on.

916
01:18:32,217 --> 01:18:33,719
Listen, Toula.

917
01:18:34,094 --> 01:18:35,471
On my wedding night...

918
01:18:35,888 --> 01:18:37,598
my mother, she said to me:

919
01:18:38,390 --> 01:18:42,060
"Greek women,
we may be lambs in the kitchen...

920
01:18:42,769 --> 01:18:44,771
"but we are tigers in the bedroom."

921
01:18:45,689 --> 01:18:48,150
Please, let that be the end of your speech.

922
01:18:48,192 --> 01:18:52,070
What is going on here? Why isn't anyone
ready? The photographer's here.

923
01:19:03,165 --> 01:19:05,250
-You need sponging?
-I'm all right.

924
01:19:24,311 --> 01:19:28,440
More. More on the top. That's it.
More hairspray.

925
01:19:35,614 --> 01:19:36,949
Oh, Maria!

926
01:19:37,950 --> 01:19:39,910
So beautiful.

927
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:43,121
She's ready!

928
01:20:00,097 --> 01:20:01,682
I'm a snow beast.

929
01:20:02,641 --> 01:20:04,101
You not a snow beast.

930
01:21:04,828 --> 01:21:05,829
My God!

931
01:21:58,507 --> 01:22:01,009
How are we supposed to know
what's going on?

932
01:22:01,051 --> 01:22:02,719
It's all Greek to me.

933
01:22:03,220 --> 01:22:04,221
Rodney!

934
01:22:29,288 --> 01:22:30,664
This is it.

935
01:22:32,457 --> 01:22:33,458
What?

936
01:22:35,252 --> 01:22:36,920
We take our first steps...

937
01:22:37,171 --> 01:22:38,881
as husband and wife.

938
01:22:41,341 --> 01:22:42,593
Are you ready?

939
01:22:42,634 --> 01:22:43,760
I'm ready.

940
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:51,453
-Where are you? Are you in there?
-Yes!

941
01:23:52,871 --> 01:23:55,374
Don't dab. Wipe, wipe off.

942
01:23:56,750 --> 01:23:58,418
-Is that better?
-Yes.

943
01:24:00,671 --> 01:24:02,464
Who did your makeup? Your aunts?

944
01:24:04,091 --> 01:24:06,969
Drag queens could get a few tips
from those aunts.

945
01:24:07,511 --> 01:24:10,430
Oh, my God. Look at me. I'm just covered!

946
01:24:10,848 --> 01:24:13,392
-Like a big, frosted cupcake.
-I know, it's like...

947
01:24:15,060 --> 01:24:16,812
Come on, help me with the veil.

948
01:24:26,655 --> 01:24:28,407
-Hey.
-Yeah, you got it.

949
01:24:42,838 --> 01:24:44,339
Do we have to go in?

950
01:24:45,507 --> 01:24:47,092
Too late to elope now.

951
01:24:48,343 --> 01:24:49,720
Let's go in.

952
01:24:50,971 --> 01:24:52,097
Okay.

953
01:24:53,140 --> 01:24:54,183
Check this out.

954
01:24:55,517 --> 01:24:57,394
It's going down. Thank God.

955
01:24:57,769 --> 01:24:58,937
What?

956
01:24:58,979 --> 01:25:01,940
I woke up with this huge zit this morning.

957
01:25:03,150 --> 01:25:04,735
-Where?
-There.

958
01:25:04,818 --> 01:25:06,904
-I had a huge zit this morning.
-You did?

959
01:25:06,987 --> 01:25:08,280
-Yeah.
-Where is it?

960
01:25:08,322 --> 01:25:10,240
Well, it was right here. But it's gone.

961
01:25:10,282 --> 01:25:11,325
Why?

962
01:25:11,450 --> 01:25:12,993
I put some Windex on it.

963
01:25:50,113 --> 01:25:51,240
Hello.

964
01:25:55,369 --> 01:25:58,664
Welcome to the Portokalos family.

965
01:26:00,082 --> 01:26:02,292
And welcome...

966
01:26:02,334 --> 01:26:04,545
the Miller family.

967
01:26:05,921 --> 01:26:08,841
I was thinking, last night...

968
01:26:10,300 --> 01:26:12,094
the night before...

969
01:26:12,261 --> 01:26:16,014
my daughter was going to marry Ian Miller...

970
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:21,061
that the root of the word "miller"...

971
01:26:21,270 --> 01:26:22,354
is a Greek word.

972
01:26:22,729 --> 01:26:26,024
And "miller" come from...

973
01:26:26,108 --> 01:26:28,110
the Greek word milo...

974
01:26:28,402 --> 01:26:30,320
which is mean "apple. "

975
01:26:30,737 --> 01:26:31,655
There you go.

976
01:26:35,951 --> 01:26:37,995
As many of you know...

977
01:26:38,245 --> 01:26:40,247
our name Portokalos...

978
01:26:40,372 --> 01:26:43,208
is come from the Greek word portokali...

979
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:45,502
which means "orange. "

980
01:26:46,044 --> 01:26:47,588
So, okay...

981
01:26:47,921 --> 01:26:49,214
here tonight...

982
01:26:49,381 --> 01:26:52,885
we have apple and orange.

983
01:26:55,304 --> 01:26:57,639
We all different...

984
01:26:58,265 --> 01:27:01,810
but, in the end, we all fruit.

985
01:27:06,190 --> 01:27:07,691
Yes, we are all fruit.

986
01:27:12,613 --> 01:27:14,948
My wife and me, we have a gift.

987
01:27:15,991 --> 01:27:18,160
That's what we do. The parents give a gift.

988
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:25,584
Here.

989
01:27:32,674 --> 01:27:33,759
My God!

990
01:27:35,010 --> 01:27:36,470
They bought us a house.

991
01:28:11,505 --> 01:28:12,631
Thank you.

992
01:28:18,762 --> 01:28:19,805
I love you.

993
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:22,975
I love you, too.

994
01:28:26,228 --> 01:28:27,771
I don't believe it.

995
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:29,690
A house!

996
01:28:40,450 --> 01:28:42,369
Thia Voula, we're going to dance.

997
01:28:42,411 --> 01:28:44,955
-I know, dear. Let me get Taki.
-Okay.

998
01:28:45,122 --> 01:28:48,000
Athena, I'm going to be a painter.

999
01:28:48,208 --> 01:28:50,669
Good. You can start with our fence.

1000
01:28:53,213 --> 01:28:56,049
This is just a really nice wedding.

1001
01:28:56,133 --> 01:28:58,677
Good. We're going to dance now. Come on.

1002
01:28:58,719 --> 01:28:59,720
No.

1003
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:02,389
I'll need a little more ouzo before I do that.

1004
01:29:02,431 --> 01:29:04,183
What do you say?

1005
01:29:07,227 --> 01:29:08,562
Bottoms up.

1006
01:29:12,274 --> 01:29:14,067
-All right.
-Let's go, Harry.

1007
01:29:16,153 --> 01:29:17,529
Come on, Kosta.

1008
01:29:17,821 --> 01:29:19,781
All right.

1009
01:29:24,119 --> 01:29:25,704
Oh, Taki.

1010
01:29:26,747 --> 01:29:28,248
He looks Greek.

1011
01:29:53,065 --> 01:29:54,608
Yia sou, Ian.

1012
01:30:03,075 --> 01:30:05,994
Sometimes, I'm afraid that it didn't happen.

1013
01:30:06,119 --> 01:30:09,498
I'm scared I'll wake up
and still be buttering garlic bread...

1014
01:30:09,540 --> 01:30:11,750
waiting for my life to start.

1015
01:30:11,750 --> 01:30:13,710
But it did happen. It did!

1016
01:30:14,127 --> 01:30:15,671
And I figured out some stuff.

1017
01:30:15,921 --> 01:30:17,965
My family is big and loud...

1018
01:30:18,298 --> 01:30:19,633
but they're my family.

1019
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:21,552
We fight and we laugh.

1020
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:24,429
And yes, we roast lamb on a spit
in the front yard.

1021
01:30:24,972 --> 01:30:27,391
And wherever I go, whatever I do...

1022
01:30:27,975 --> 01:30:29,685
they will always be there.

1023
01:30:37,109 --> 01:30:40,487
So, Ian and I moved into the house
my parents bought us.

1024
01:30:40,821 --> 01:30:42,531
A minute later, I was pregnant.

1025
01:30:42,614 --> 01:30:45,951
And six years later, it was our
daughter's turn to go to Greek school.

1026
01:30:46,034 --> 01:30:48,203
Mom, I want to go to Brownies.

1027
01:30:48,328 --> 01:30:50,581
I know, but I promise you this.

1028
01:30:50,831 --> 01:30:53,292
You can marry anybody you want.

1029
01:30:53,750 --> 01:30:55,627
Thanks, baby.

1030
01:30:56,170 --> 01:30:57,463
Greek school, pame.

1031
01:30:59,173 --> 01:31:00,174
What's that mean?

1032
01:31:00,299 --> 01:31:01,300
"Let's go."

1033
01:31:01,341 --> 01:31:03,010
-Let's go.
-That's pretty good.

1034
01:31:03,093 --> 01:31:04,595
-Looking good, Gus.
-Hi, Dad.

1035
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:06,388
-Where you going?
-Greek school.

1036
01:31:07,097 --> 01:31:08,098
Baklava!
