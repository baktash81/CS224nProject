1
00:00:10,545 --> 00:00:12,618
The 4 musicians of Bremen

2
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:16,018
Inspired by Brothers Grimm's fairy tale

3
00:02:51,514 --> 00:02:55,978
Hey, get out of the way, you ominous jackdaw.

4
00:03:16,504 --> 00:03:19,605
It's doggy weather.

5
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:31,431
# Come on, girls and chicks, let's all dance.

6
00:03:31,797 --> 00:03:36,129
# The night is here, let's party.

7
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:41,227
# Who knows, fellows, what will happen tomorrow.

8
00:03:41,327 --> 00:03:43,544
# When the grumpy master opens the door

9
00:03:43,644 --> 00:03:47,445
# and shouts, "How many eggs are there?"

10
00:03:48,804 --> 00:03:53,804
# Come on, girls and chicks, let's all go dancing.

11
00:03:54,112 --> 00:03:58,522
# The night has come, let's celebrate.

12
00:03:58,622 --> 00:04:03,721
# Koki, Koki, Koki, you're the king of the barnyard.

13
00:04:04,071 --> 00:04:06,208
# Koki, Koki, Koki, let's dance.

14
00:04:06,308 --> 00:04:09,345
# Every night is a party in the barnyard.

15
00:04:09,445 --> 00:04:14,045
# Koki, Koki, Koki, you're the king of the pen.

16
00:04:14,232 --> 00:04:17,833
# Koki, Koki, Koki, Koki, Koki, Koki.

17
00:04:18,565 --> 00:04:23,397
# Do you know, fellows, what will happen tomorrow

18
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:25,544
# when the grumpy master opens the door...

19
00:04:25,644 --> 00:04:29,544
# and shouts "How many eggs are there?".

20
00:04:30,946 --> 00:04:35,746
# Koki, Koki, Koki, you're the king of the barnyard.

21
00:04:35,955 --> 00:04:40,056
# Koki, Koki, Koki, let's dance.

22
00:04:41,325 --> 00:04:45,644
# Koki, Koki, Koki, you're the king of the barnyard. #

23
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:49,354
Koki continues with his nocturnal amusements.

24
00:04:49,454 --> 00:04:52,854
I hope he never has to regret it.

25
00:06:17,214 --> 00:06:19,214
Woah!

26
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:26,933
The sheets are sticking to you again, eh, old man?

27
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,766
Is that you, Hans?

28
00:06:34,866 --> 00:06:37,308
Sure, old man. Who else would it be?

29
00:06:37,408 --> 00:06:39,279
I'm your alarm clock.

30
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:43,479
If it weren't for me, you'd be in bed all day long.

31
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,605
-You can't even keep your pants on anymore.
-Shut up.

32
00:06:48,705 --> 00:06:52,505
You're too old for farm work.

33
00:06:53,957 --> 00:06:57,057
Lock up your dirty cow!

34
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,757
Giddyup, you beast. The old man can't take a joke.

35
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:06,960
I'll teach you how to play jokes, you fool!

36
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,543
Get out of here, get out!

37
00:07:09,643 --> 00:07:12,897
It's that damn rooster's fault that I fall asleep every morning.

38
00:07:12,997 --> 00:07:14,301
He doesn't crow in the morning anymore

39
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:17,414
and that's why I'm late for farm chores.

40
00:07:17,514 --> 00:07:20,514
I don't want a queeny rooster on my farm.

41
00:07:21,226 --> 00:07:25,513
Koki overslept again and the master is angrier than ever.

42
00:07:25,858 --> 00:07:29,158
He's got the axe. I must warn Koki!

43
00:07:39,132 --> 00:07:40,817
Mommy is sounding the alarm!

44
00:07:40,917 --> 00:07:44,193
That rooster is not worth the grain he eats.

45
00:07:44,293 --> 00:07:48,493
Koki, Koki, wake up, please, hurry!

46
00:07:48,788 --> 00:07:49,834
What's the matter?

47
00:07:49,934 --> 00:07:53,734
Run away, Koki! Run away before it's too late!

48
00:07:54,717 --> 00:07:57,416
Where's that sleepy rooster?

49
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,620
You rascal, you won't get far!

50
00:08:11,997 --> 00:08:13,734
Where are you?

51
00:08:13,834 --> 00:08:14,902
The master's got it in for me.

52
00:08:15,002 --> 00:08:16,680
He wants to kill me.

53
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,468
He doesn't like my parties at all.

54
00:08:18,568 --> 00:08:22,065
He doesn't understand music.
-No, he doesn't understand music.

55
00:08:23,592 --> 00:08:26,105
-Watch out, he's coming!
-Run, boy!

56
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:28,805
We'll cover your retreat.

57
00:08:33,253 --> 00:08:37,223
What's this? Get out of here, damn you!

58
00:08:40,442 --> 00:08:43,502
Oh, my foot! Out of the way, out!

59
00:08:43,602 --> 00:08:45,602
Out of my way!

60
00:08:48,253 --> 00:08:51,152
What's the matter, little one? Is there an earthquake?

61
00:08:51,623 --> 00:08:55,823
Worse, the master is furious and he's chasing Koki with the axe to...

62
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:59,155
What? We have to help him. Come on, my dear.

63
00:08:59,255 --> 00:09:01,255
Yes, come on, dear.

64
00:09:01,537 --> 00:09:03,168
I've got you! Get out!

65
00:09:03,268 --> 00:09:05,468
Now you won't get away.

66
00:09:06,289 --> 00:09:07,630
I have to help Koki.

67
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,331
Leave me at once.

68
00:09:09,431 --> 00:09:11,431
What's going on here today?

69
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,884
A rebellion!

70
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:20,392
Jump on me, Koki. I'll get you off the farm.

71
00:09:20,492 --> 00:09:23,192
Hurry, boy, there's no time to lose.

72
00:09:23,644 --> 00:09:25,868
Damn animals!

73
00:09:25,968 --> 00:09:27,560
Cow, come back here!

74
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,374
You've all ganged up on me!

75
00:09:30,474 --> 00:09:33,917
Goodbye, friends! Thanks for your help!

76
00:09:34,017 --> 00:09:35,930
Goodbye, be careful!

77
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:38,129
Goodbye, Koki.

78
00:09:40,303 --> 00:09:44,297
And thanks to you, Mami. I'll never forget what you've done for me.

79
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:49,015
We're friends, aren't we? And friends are there to help each other, Koki.

80
00:09:49,115 --> 00:09:51,200
Now you're out of danger and we must part ways.

81
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,710
Go on your way, boy. You weren't born to live in a corral.

82
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:59,819
You're right, Mommy. What I like is music.

83
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:02,894
I know, and I wish you the best of luck.

84
00:10:02,994 --> 00:10:06,859
Will you ever go back to the farm to visit your old friends?

85
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,354
I will. Tell Bella and everyone.

86
00:10:09,454 --> 00:10:11,554
I'll be back someday.

87
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:15,314
Goodbye, son. We'll wait for you.

88
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:17,414
Farewell!

89
00:10:21,249 --> 00:10:23,142
I wish I knew where I was.

90
00:10:23,242 --> 00:10:25,634
I've walked a long way and I'm hungry.

91
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,501
I'll see if I can see anything from that branch.

92
00:10:32,157 --> 00:10:35,427
Nothing around here... What luck, a mill!

93
00:10:35,527 --> 00:10:38,527
I'll find plenty of grain there to satisfy my hunger.

94
00:10:56,134 --> 00:10:58,334
Are you sad, Silly?

95
00:10:59,361 --> 00:11:01,461
What's the matter with you?

96
00:11:01,777 --> 00:11:04,277
It's the load of flour, isn't it?

97
00:11:04,524 --> 00:11:07,782
I'd like to help you but my aunt won't let me.

98
00:11:07,882 --> 00:11:09,882
What could I do?

99
00:11:11,078 --> 00:11:13,078
Oh, how heavy this is!

100
00:11:14,095 --> 00:11:15,803
Out of my way, child.

101
00:11:15,903 --> 00:11:19,403
But Auntie, Silly won't be able to carry that much weight.

102
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:24,872
Pull! There's still another sack left. Every day this damned donkey is worth less and less.

103
00:11:24,972 --> 00:11:28,678
But come on! What's the matter with you, you good-for-nothing?

104
00:11:28,786 --> 00:11:31,186
Don't you dare to sneeze now!

105
00:11:31,835 --> 00:11:33,332
Don't you see what you've done, you stupid donkey?

106
00:11:33,432 --> 00:11:34,871
Poor Silly! Have you hurt yourself?

107
00:11:34,971 --> 00:11:38,723
Woman, you've already ground up the last sack. I'll help you carry it.

108
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,715
I'm coming.

109
00:11:40,815 --> 00:11:45,351
Please, Auntie, don't load Silly any more. He's small and weak.

110
00:11:45,451 --> 00:11:48,951
He's tired and he won't be able to carry three sacks again.

111
00:11:49,678 --> 00:11:52,677
Bah, I don't give a damn. Let him collapse.

112
00:11:52,777 --> 00:11:54,427
For what little he's good for and what a fool he is...

113
00:11:54,527 --> 00:11:57,831
I'll sell him at the cattle fair and buy a stronger donkey.

114
00:12:00,805 --> 00:12:05,059
I'd rather you left, my donkey. It's better for you.

115
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:07,896
Let's go with the last one.

116
00:12:07,996 --> 00:12:11,496
No, Aunt, please, don't load him any more.

117
00:12:13,465 --> 00:12:17,528
What's this? Where did this rooster come from?

118
00:12:17,628 --> 00:12:20,128
Help, help!

119
00:12:29,544 --> 00:12:31,544
My flour!

120
00:12:31,789 --> 00:12:35,479
And you're to blame for everything! Stupid!

121
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:37,550
But aunt, if he doesn't...

122
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:40,250
I'll beat you to a pulp!

123
00:12:41,749 --> 00:12:43,749
You again?

124
00:12:44,016 --> 00:12:46,332
Here, here!

125
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,833
Run, Silly, I don't want her to hit you!

126
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,959
Get out of here, get out!

127
00:12:53,197 --> 00:12:57,734
Run, Silly. Do it for me. Run away.

128
00:13:08,172 --> 00:13:11,272
I love you very much but run away, please, run away.

129
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,269
Goodbye, Silly. Take care of yourself.

130
00:13:26,469 --> 00:13:30,292
Forgive the pecks, boy, but you had to escape from that witch.

131
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:36,592
I just didn't want to be separated from my beloved master girl. I feel so sorry for her.

132
00:13:37,439 --> 00:13:39,179
There was no other solution, boy.

133
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,807
Well, don't get sentimental and let's get out of here.

134
00:13:41,907 --> 00:13:44,277
Yeah, okay.

135
00:13:44,377 --> 00:13:47,955
My name is Silly.
-Silly?

136
00:13:48,414 --> 00:13:51,514
Yeah, the name suits you, yeah.

137
00:13:51,704 --> 00:13:53,433
And what's your name?

138
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,634
Koki. My name is Koki.

139
00:14:24,233 --> 00:14:25,964
Very good, very good!

140
00:14:26,064 --> 00:14:28,287
What could that be? Do you see something, Koki?

141
00:14:28,387 --> 00:14:30,387
I'll see it now.

142
00:14:31,226 --> 00:14:33,826
It's a great show.

143
00:14:34,117 --> 00:14:36,717
Make way, Silly. We'll see it in the front row.

144
00:14:37,088 --> 00:14:38,848
But what are these animals doing here?

145
00:14:38,948 --> 00:14:42,049
Well, where do these critters come from?

146
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:48,689
# Dance, Lupo, dance, dance with passion.

147
00:14:49,543 --> 00:14:52,394
# You'll keep the rhythm to the sound of the clarinet.

148
00:14:52,494 --> 00:14:57,552
# Let the trumpet sound. He who has fun plays, do play already.

149
00:14:57,652 --> 00:14:59,423
# Dance, dance more.

150
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:02,323
# Play, play, play more.

151
00:15:03,036 --> 00:15:06,060
# You'll keep the rhythm dancing to my song.

152
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,584
# Be the dancer and sing with passion.

153
00:15:09,684 --> 00:15:13,068
# Play, play now. Dance, dance more.

154
00:15:13,168 --> 00:15:18,269
# Play, play, play more. Dance, Lupo, dance.

155
00:15:18,597 --> 00:15:21,697
# Dance my song.

156
00:15:21,843 --> 00:15:24,843
# Dance, Lupo, dance.

157
00:15:25,226 --> 00:15:28,404
# Dance with passion.

158
00:15:28,504 --> 00:15:31,704
# Dance, Lupo, dance.

159
00:15:31,881 --> 00:15:35,019
# Dance my song

160
00:15:35,119 --> 00:15:38,377
# Dance, Lupo, dance.

161
00:15:38,477 --> 00:15:42,077
# Dance with passion. #

162
00:15:42,276 --> 00:15:44,133
Thank you for your applause, friends.

163
00:15:44,233 --> 00:15:47,233
I knew you'd love my music,

164
00:15:47,524 --> 00:15:51,104
so I hope to see a lot of coins in my hat.

165
00:15:51,204 --> 00:15:55,874
Come on, Lupo, get to work, pass the hat... but very politely.

166
00:16:02,674 --> 00:16:05,574
Good, very good. Here you go, doggy.

167
00:16:07,504 --> 00:16:11,305
Are you a circus dog? Let's see, prove it to me.

168
00:16:11,445 --> 00:16:14,245
Very good! Here, you've earned it.

169
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:19,266
I want to ride the burrito. I want to ride!

170
00:16:19,366 --> 00:16:21,237
Hurry up, lazybones.

171
00:16:21,337 --> 00:16:23,967
Come on, I can't be waiting here all day.

172
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:28,767
Let's see how far the generosity of these yokels goes.

173
00:16:33,408 --> 00:16:34,940
What a pittance!

174
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,240
These cheapskates don't appreciate good music.

175
00:16:39,742 --> 00:16:41,742
What's this?

176
00:16:43,004 --> 00:16:45,004
A counterfeit coin!

177
00:16:45,195 --> 00:16:48,296
I'll never play in this miserable village again!

178
00:16:48,548 --> 00:16:49,711
What? It's not possible! Only six coins?

179
00:16:49,811 --> 00:16:53,437
I could have sworn they'd thrown more at you. Where are you hiding the missing coin?

180
00:16:53,537 --> 00:16:56,070
There are only six, and I counted seven.

181
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:58,514
Come on, give it to me or I'll beat you to a pulp.

182
00:16:58,614 --> 00:17:00,558
I know your tricks.

183
00:17:00,658 --> 00:17:04,041
Drop that coin at once, you ungrateful mutt.

184
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,175
What a hit he's given him!

185
00:17:08,289 --> 00:17:11,188
Well, well, and it's a gold coin!

186
00:17:13,093 --> 00:17:16,858
Wait for me here, you mangy dog. I'm going to freshen up my gullet.

187
00:17:22,902 --> 00:17:27,245
Hello. I'm Koki, and this is my friend, Silly.

188
00:17:27,345 --> 00:17:29,150
I saw you in the audience earlier.

189
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,624
By the way, you didn't throw me a dime.

190
00:17:32,724 --> 00:17:34,824
We're broke, kid.

191
00:17:35,109 --> 00:17:36,903
What's your name? Lupo, right?

192
00:17:37,003 --> 00:17:40,603
Yes, Lupo, the only friend that ungrateful musician has.

193
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:43,035
We've seen how he treated you.

194
00:17:43,135 --> 00:17:44,611
He's a dog "explorer".

195
00:17:44,711 --> 00:17:46,151
You mean an "exploiter".

196
00:17:46,251 --> 00:17:48,967
That's right, "explotioner" of dogs.

197
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:52,223
Everything we earn playing in the villages he spends on beer.

198
00:17:52,323 --> 00:17:56,323
While I'm hungry as a dog and getting skinnier every day.

199
00:17:57,631 --> 00:18:00,717
But you're the star of the show.

200
00:18:00,817 --> 00:18:06,204
If I could find someone to form an ensemble with I'd go to Bremen, where there's a contest going on.

201
00:18:06,304 --> 00:18:09,851
A musical contest where contestants compete?

202
00:18:09,951 --> 00:18:13,586
Yes, for amateur musicians. Isn't that great?

203
00:18:13,686 --> 00:18:17,355
Boy, don't go on, you've just found what you're looking for.

204
00:18:17,455 --> 00:18:22,755
Yeah, count us in for that contestant contest.

205
00:18:22,979 --> 00:18:26,127
Not to brag, but... I sing beautifully.

206
00:18:26,227 --> 00:18:29,328
I'd like to play the drums.

207
00:18:30,177 --> 00:18:34,926
Great! What are we waiting for, comrades? Let's go to Bremen.

208
00:18:39,646 --> 00:18:43,454
-Where's the mangy dog?
-My master! Let's run away!

209
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:48,514
Hey! Where are you going with those vermin? Stop!

210
00:18:48,614 --> 00:18:51,114
We'll hide here, comrades.

211
00:18:53,194 --> 00:18:56,186
You won't escape, you ungrateful mutt.

212
00:18:56,286 --> 00:18:58,257
I hope he didn't see us come in.

213
00:18:58,357 --> 00:19:01,557
Well, just in case, I'm locking the door.

214
00:19:06,689 --> 00:19:10,788
Aha! So you've been hiding here with these animals.

215
00:19:11,529 --> 00:19:14,330
Did you think you were going to make fun of me?

216
00:19:15,002 --> 00:19:20,302
I'm going to beat you to a pulp. And your friends too, for helping you.

217
00:19:20,713 --> 00:19:25,118
Don't run away, you vermin! I'll beat you to a pulp!

218
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:36,586
You won't get away with it. Where are you hiding, you cowardly vermins?

219
00:19:36,686 --> 00:19:41,727
Come out! Where are you? Come out of your hiding place.

220
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,800
Here you come, eh?

221
00:19:53,384 --> 00:19:54,907
I'll get you for this!

222
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,007
Quickly, Lupo, this way!

223
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:02,675
I know you're in there, you stubborn ass. You won't escape.

224
00:20:02,775 --> 00:20:06,476
You're going to take hits for all the three of you.

225
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:09,030
Come here, donkey.

226
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,516
Oh, it'll get me!

227
00:20:19,991 --> 00:20:20,976
Oh, how poorly I feel!

228
00:20:21,076 --> 00:20:24,003
But, what were those animals doing in my cellar?

229
00:20:24,103 --> 00:20:26,103
What a pain!

230
00:20:26,298 --> 00:20:29,246
Is that you? How dare you smash my barrels?

231
00:20:29,346 --> 00:20:31,754
No... I'm leaving now...

232
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:40,329
I'm sorry for the beating my master took, but he brought it on himself.

233
00:20:40,584 --> 00:20:42,889
Let's go before he comes after us again.

234
00:20:42,989 --> 00:20:45,689
Yes, let's go to Bremen, comrades.

235
00:20:59,921 --> 00:21:03,020
How much further to Bremen?

236
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:06,931
We've been walking all day.

237
00:21:07,072 --> 00:21:09,572
I can't go any further.

238
00:21:10,262 --> 00:21:13,847
Look, a house. And it looks like it's abandoned.

239
00:21:14,123 --> 00:21:16,179
We could spend the night in it.

240
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:18,379
That, and rest.

241
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:22,729
It looks like a mysterious house.

242
00:21:22,829 --> 00:21:25,280
One of those with a lot of mystery.

243
00:21:27,588 --> 00:21:30,088
It scares the hell out of me.

244
00:21:31,025 --> 00:21:34,439
Come on, don't be a chicken. We'll take a look.

245
00:21:34,539 --> 00:21:39,257
Hey, hey, no offense, I'm a rooster and I'm not afraid.

246
00:21:40,404 --> 00:21:45,604
I don't want to go in. I'm sure there are ghosts.

247
00:21:46,061 --> 00:21:48,061
Let's go in.

248
00:21:50,339 --> 00:21:53,039
Don't go, it's worse.

249
00:21:53,456 --> 00:21:56,856
You don't believe in that ghost nonsense, huh?

250
00:21:56,956 --> 00:21:59,156
Come on, let's go.

251
00:22:01,504 --> 00:22:04,204
Wait for me, don't leave me alone.

252
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:12,586
We'll look through the window to see if anyone's there.

253
00:22:17,444 --> 00:22:21,224
What a run I've had!

254
00:22:22,413 --> 00:22:25,512
Don't make any noise. There may be someone in the house.

255
00:22:25,692 --> 00:22:28,292
Could there be someone?

256
00:22:28,792 --> 00:22:31,192
Ghosts?

257
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,992
Now we'll see, Silly, and stop shaking.

258
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:39,474
Up.
-Get ready, guys, I'm coming.

259
00:22:40,714 --> 00:22:42,524
What do you see, Koki?

260
00:22:42,624 --> 00:22:45,424
It's all very dark. I'll open the window.

261
00:22:47,823 --> 00:22:51,753
-Do you see anything?
-Yes, a very big room.

262
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:03,420
Oh, you hit the ground, Lupo?

263
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,520
What do you think?

264
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:09,782
I didn't mean to. It's just that when I get scared, I sneeze.

265
00:23:09,882 --> 00:23:12,394
And when I sneeze, I get scared.

266
00:23:12,494 --> 00:23:14,565
Where's Koki?

267
00:23:14,665 --> 00:23:17,566
Come on, you can go in now.

268
00:23:17,798 --> 00:23:21,830
-Come on, Silly.
-Yes, if there's no other way...

269
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,130
Quiet, Silly.

270
00:23:45,004 --> 00:23:48,004
I'm very scared.

271
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,440
Don't be afraid. It's only a clock that tells the time.

272
00:23:52,117 --> 00:23:54,517
How many strange things there are here!

273
00:23:55,304 --> 00:23:58,662
Look, what's all these musical instruments doing here?

274
00:23:58,762 --> 00:24:01,259
Quiet, Koki, they can hear us.

275
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:03,318
We're in an abandoned house.

276
00:24:03,418 --> 00:24:05,679
I don't think there's anyone around here.

277
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:07,958
It certainly doesn't look like it.

278
00:24:08,058 --> 00:24:13,239
Then who's all that food in there for?

279
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:20,380
It looks as if the inhabitants of this house have left in a hurry.

280
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,502
Without clearing the table.

281
00:24:22,602 --> 00:24:25,701
Then no one's here. At least for the moment.

282
00:24:25,933 --> 00:24:28,133
Looks that way, guys.

283
00:24:28,574 --> 00:24:31,074
I don't trust it.

284
00:24:31,246 --> 00:24:36,150
What if the inhabitants of this house heard us enter and have hidden?

285
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:41,621
Nonsense! Besides, if they're hiding, they're afraid of us.

286
00:24:41,721 --> 00:24:45,721
They may have hidden to attack us by surprise.

287
00:24:47,195 --> 00:24:52,595
All right, all right, boys, we'll search the house and find out for sure.

288
00:24:53,478 --> 00:24:57,879
We'll go our separate ways. We'll meet here, next to the armor.

289
00:24:58,091 --> 00:25:01,091
All right. If anyone sees anything strange, let the others know.

290
00:25:05,014 --> 00:25:07,615
Oh, how lonely they've left me!

291
00:25:07,787 --> 00:25:12,965
I'm so scared. Koki. Koki, where are you?

292
00:25:13,065 --> 00:25:15,289
Gee, gee.

293
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:18,742
Koki, Koki! Did you see something?

294
00:25:20,337 --> 00:25:24,531
What's all that, shining so brightly?

295
00:25:24,631 --> 00:25:28,456
Well, well! What do you think of all this treasure?

296
00:25:28,556 --> 00:25:31,781
It looks like a necklace, and a very pretty one.

297
00:25:31,881 --> 00:25:36,260
There are many other things of great value. Look at that, Silly.

298
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,593
Gold coins, my goodness!

299
00:25:39,693 --> 00:25:42,119
Gold, jewels, and precious stones.

300
00:25:42,219 --> 00:25:44,719
It's like Ali Baba's cave in here.

301
00:25:48,585 --> 00:25:50,784
What a shock I've had with this thing!

302
00:25:55,581 --> 00:26:00,380
Judging by the junk, three people live here.

303
00:26:00,736 --> 00:26:02,736
What kind of people are they?

304
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:07,640
The clothes of the inhabitants of this mansion...

305
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,040
What are all these keys for?

306
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:14,417
What about these? They look like lock picks.

307
00:26:15,165 --> 00:26:17,765
And the old master says they're for opening doors.

308
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:22,380
A mask! Will they use it to disguise themselves?

309
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:25,798
And money, lots of money.

310
00:26:25,898 --> 00:26:28,296
Gee, there are thieves living here.

311
00:26:28,396 --> 00:26:30,186
This is all very mysterious.

312
00:26:30,286 --> 00:26:34,393
I'll meet with Koki and Silly. I'll tell them what I've found out.

313
00:26:34,493 --> 00:26:35,803
Guys! Where are you?

314
00:26:35,903 --> 00:26:37,393
Here, Lupo.

315
00:26:37,493 --> 00:26:42,193
Look what we found: a real treasure.

316
00:26:42,623 --> 00:26:46,493
Look, this chest is full of jewels and gold coins.

317
00:26:46,593 --> 00:26:49,484
No wonder; this is a den of thieves.

318
00:26:49,584 --> 00:26:53,025
Leave that there. I'll explain what I saw upstairs.

319
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:55,215
Tell me, tell me.

320
00:26:55,315 --> 00:27:00,696
Upstairs I saw lock picks, masks, and three disguises.

321
00:27:00,796 --> 00:27:04,796
Then you're right, Lupo, this is the lair of three thieves.

322
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:10,000
Let's get out of here before they find us and discover us.

323
00:27:13,462 --> 00:27:15,524
We've been spotted!

324
00:27:15,624 --> 00:27:18,524
Easy, Silly, it was just thunder.

325
00:27:19,046 --> 00:27:23,287
I thought it was the thieves returning to their lair.

326
00:27:23,387 --> 00:27:28,826
Maybe they'll be back tonight, and maybe they won't, but the table is set and I'm hungry.

327
00:27:28,926 --> 00:27:31,694
We'll get something to eat and then we'll see what we have to do.

328
00:27:31,794 --> 00:27:33,794
That's a good idea.

329
00:27:34,757 --> 00:27:36,956
This is delicious.

330
00:27:37,339 --> 00:27:39,740
Tell me about it, Koki.

331
00:27:40,762 --> 00:27:42,706
I propose a toast, guys.

332
00:27:42,806 --> 00:27:46,770
That's right, a toast, like the important people.

333
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:48,971
Let's toast to our friendship.

334
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:00,979
Look, the warrior's helmet is moving.

335
00:28:01,473 --> 00:28:04,573
The champagne's gone to your head and you're seeing visions, Silly.

336
00:28:04,673 --> 00:28:09,089
I tell you, the helmet is moving. It is bewitched. It's looking at me.

337
00:28:09,316 --> 00:28:12,515
You're nervous and it's making you see strange things.

338
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:15,595
See? It's just the helmet of a suit of armor.

339
00:28:15,695 --> 00:28:18,695
Look at it. Holy crap!

340
00:28:21,011 --> 00:28:23,135
-But it's a cat!
-Let's surround him. Don't let him get away.

341
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:25,835
He's been spying on us the whole time.

342
00:28:26,201 --> 00:28:28,501
Leave him to me.

343
00:28:29,888 --> 00:28:33,188
A cat! I got scared of a cat!

344
00:28:33,315 --> 00:28:35,615
Hold it right there, little fella.

345
00:28:36,813 --> 00:28:39,061
Hey, cat, where did you come from?

346
00:28:39,161 --> 00:28:40,540
Guess if you can.

347
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,840
You're not going to tell us you lived inside the warrior's helmet.

348
00:28:45,368 --> 00:28:47,286
What silly questions.

349
00:28:47,386 --> 00:28:50,105
I don't live in any helmet and I haven't come out of anywhere.

350
00:28:50,205 --> 00:28:52,323
I've always been here.

351
00:28:52,423 --> 00:28:55,443
How so? We didn't see you when we arrived.

352
00:28:55,543 --> 00:28:56,401
Let's see, explain yourself.

353
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:59,302
I don't explain myself to anyone,

354
00:28:59,601 --> 00:29:03,400
least of all to vagabonds like you.

355
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:07,210
He called us vagabonds... Us!

356
00:29:07,348 --> 00:29:11,047
Tell us who you are and what you're doing in this mysterious house.

357
00:29:13,417 --> 00:29:16,417
Speak. Speak!

358
00:29:17,657 --> 00:29:19,238
I can't if you squeeze my neck. Let go of me.

359
00:29:19,338 --> 00:29:21,438
All right. Speak.

360
00:29:21,889 --> 00:29:23,889
My neck! You almost choked me!

361
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:27,463
My name is Mocker, and I live here incognito.

362
00:29:27,914 --> 00:29:30,837
What does he mean "incognito"?

363
00:29:30,937 --> 00:29:33,149
That no one knows he lives here.

364
00:29:33,249 --> 00:29:37,150
I came here incognito because I don't like hunting mice for any master.

365
00:29:37,502 --> 00:29:40,902
Well, we know you live here.

366
00:29:41,124 --> 00:29:43,596
But no one else. You get it?

367
00:29:43,696 --> 00:29:47,339
In this manor house lost in the woods I feel free and happy.

368
00:29:47,439 --> 00:29:49,722
I was about to dinner when you arrived.

369
00:29:49,822 --> 00:29:52,314
Then I hid in the warrior's helmet.

370
00:29:52,414 --> 00:29:55,287
Too much dinner for one cat, don't you think?

371
00:29:55,387 --> 00:29:58,674
-Who lives here with you?
-I don't live with anyone.

372
00:29:58,774 --> 00:30:03,223
But some strange guys and a stupid dog come to this house every once in a while,

373
00:30:03,323 --> 00:30:05,647
loaded with stuff they leave here.

374
00:30:05,747 --> 00:30:08,892
-A dog?
-Yes. A stupid one.

375
00:30:08,992 --> 00:30:12,431
You know what? The food you guys ate was the leftovers from the dinners

376
00:30:12,531 --> 00:30:15,126
of those guys who come to the manor house.

377
00:30:15,226 --> 00:30:18,526
What if they come back now and surprise us?

378
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:21,647
I don't think so, they always come back at dawn.

379
00:30:21,747 --> 00:30:26,601
By the way, you still haven't told me who you are and what you came here to do.

380
00:30:26,701 --> 00:30:30,588
-I am Koki.
-And I'm Silly. Hello.

381
00:30:30,784 --> 00:30:33,742
My name is Lupo. Sorry about before, kid.

382
00:30:33,842 --> 00:30:37,077
And now high-five. Friends?

383
00:30:37,177 --> 00:30:40,243
You know what? This is the first time I ever shook hands with a mutt.

384
00:30:40,343 --> 00:30:42,521
That's funny.

385
00:30:42,621 --> 00:30:46,321
And me, it's the first time I ever shook hands with a stray cat.

386
00:30:47,588 --> 00:30:49,707
We're music nuts

387
00:30:49,807 --> 00:30:53,405
and we're going to Bremen to take part in a music competition.

388
00:30:53,505 --> 00:30:57,723
We've come a long way and decided to rest here before continuing our journey.

389
00:30:57,823 --> 00:31:00,323
So you like music, huh?

390
00:31:00,571 --> 00:31:02,871
Yuppie! And I love it too!

391
00:31:06,032 --> 00:31:08,831
I always play the saxophone whenever I have the chance.

392
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:23,270
# I've never had an owner or friends.

393
00:31:23,739 --> 00:31:29,649
# I feel so lonely that sometimes I say to myself...

394
00:31:29,749 --> 00:31:38,160
# that although I'm a cat, I have a heart that beats when you play the saxophone.

395
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:41,551
# I wanted to be free and they didn't let me.

396
00:31:41,651 --> 00:31:45,049
# I wanted to be good and they mistreated me.

397
00:31:45,149 --> 00:31:49,411
# Human beings are sometimes very cruel...

398
00:31:49,511 --> 00:31:53,644
# and hurts you even if you are faithful.

399
00:31:53,744 --> 00:31:56,916
# The best vaccine against melancholy...

400
00:31:57,016 --> 00:32:00,828
# is to fill your life with songs and love.

401
00:32:00,928 --> 00:32:04,341
# Sing with us this super melody

402
00:32:04,441 --> 00:32:07,748
# and you'll see how quickly the good mood comes to you.

403
00:32:07,848 --> 00:32:11,357
# We are going to win with a lot of rhythm and harmony.

404
00:32:11,457 --> 00:32:14,882
# Of all the bands we are going to be the best.

405
00:32:14,982 --> 00:32:18,336
# The best vaccine against melancholy...

406
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:22,372
# is to fill your life with songs and love.

407
00:32:22,472 --> 00:32:25,767
# The best vaccine against the melancholy

408
00:32:25,867 --> 00:32:29,373
# is to fill life with songs and love.

409
00:32:29,473 --> 00:32:33,087
# Sing with us this super melody

410
00:32:33,187 --> 00:32:36,387
# and you'll see how quickly the good mood comes to you. #

411
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:57,432
Stop!

412
00:32:58,171 --> 00:33:01,338
-Wake up, Attila!
-Stop it!

413
00:33:03,567 --> 00:33:07,233
Silence, useless ones. This is no time to play games.

414
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:10,421
This is a good place. We'll hide here. Let's move.

415
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:13,039
Our friend will soon pass this way.

416
00:33:13,139 --> 00:33:16,396
Look in what shape you left my bike, you little runt.

417
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:18,965
It's this dumb dog's fault, you mastodon.

418
00:33:19,065 --> 00:33:21,617
Shut up at once, you good-for-nothings.

419
00:33:21,717 --> 00:33:24,517
You're going to ruin my plan with your arguments.

420
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:32,838
Wow, guys! We make a fantastic ensemble, don't we, guys?

421
00:33:33,019 --> 00:33:37,769
Hey, Mocker, why don't you join us? You play amazingly!

422
00:33:37,869 --> 00:33:40,101
Yeah, that's a great idea.

423
00:33:40,201 --> 00:33:44,601
The four of us together will win the Bremen music contest.

424
00:33:44,952 --> 00:33:48,245
Yeah, we'll be the four Bremen musicians.

425
00:33:48,345 --> 00:33:51,510
All right. Let me show you something.

426
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:54,210
Come here. Look at this paper.

427
00:33:54,543 --> 00:33:56,596
It speaks of your contest.

428
00:33:56,696 --> 00:34:02,161
And this is the burgomaster of Bremen who will present the prize to the winners.

429
00:34:02,261 --> 00:34:04,962
He has a nice face.

430
00:34:05,095 --> 00:34:07,767
And that trumpet must be the prize.

431
00:34:07,867 --> 00:34:09,640
Well, it'll soon be ours, guys.

432
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:14,240
That's great! As soon as the sun rises we'll leave for Bremen, comrades.

433
00:34:15,112 --> 00:34:17,612
And now, everybody go to sleep.

434
00:34:18,707 --> 00:34:21,207
Yes, that's right, to sleep.

435
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,473
What a time to call me in the middle of the night, old man!

436
00:34:29,573 --> 00:34:31,497
I couldn't wait for dawn.

437
00:34:31,597 --> 00:34:34,497
I'm sick of animals running away from me.

438
00:34:35,111 --> 00:34:38,211
Yeah, that's why you want me to help you reinforce the fence.

439
00:34:38,386 --> 00:34:39,541
What a job!

440
00:34:39,641 --> 00:34:43,641
Don't complain, Hans, I'll sell you the cow in exchange.

441
00:34:44,355 --> 00:34:46,551
Yuppie!

442
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:51,402
Oh, look what you've done, you idiot! Oh, it hurts!

443
00:34:51,502 --> 00:34:54,802
I'm sorry, your offer took me by surprise, and...

444
00:34:56,388 --> 00:35:00,334
So finish the job. We'll close the deal tomorrow.

445
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,479
Hello. What's all that squawking about?

446
00:35:07,954 --> 00:35:10,655
You don't know what happened, Mommy.

447
00:35:11,731 --> 00:35:16,138
Of course, the master is reinforcing the fence so we don't escape.

448
00:35:16,238 --> 00:35:20,226
It's not just that, it's that the master is going to sell you, Mommy.

449
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:24,902
Mommy, without you and Koki the farm won't be like before.

450
00:35:25,002 --> 00:35:26,881
What could we do?

451
00:35:26,981 --> 00:35:28,938
I know, we can run away.

452
00:35:29,038 --> 00:35:33,347
-You and me run away?
-We'll find Koki and join him.

453
00:35:33,447 --> 00:35:36,705
Make up your mind, Mommy. Bella may well leave on her own.

454
00:35:36,805 --> 00:35:41,206
Yes, yes, you're right, Bella, we'll leave together.

455
00:35:42,529 --> 00:35:45,928
Goodbye, Ocarina, we'll remember you very much.

456
00:35:46,338 --> 00:35:48,338
Oh, what a pity!

457
00:35:55,796 --> 00:35:59,695
Bella, Mommy, wait for me, I'm going with you!

458
00:36:01,472 --> 00:36:05,573
I've been hitting the mallet so much, my throat's dried up.

459
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:09,090
Watch out, Mommy, someone's coming.

460
00:36:09,237 --> 00:36:11,237
I'll have a drink of water.

461
00:36:13,634 --> 00:36:16,034
Where did this crazy goose come from?

462
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:19,412
Strange things happen on this farm!

463
00:36:21,459 --> 00:36:23,659
I've decided to go with you.

464
00:36:24,067 --> 00:36:26,567
Let's take the opportunity to escape now.

465
00:36:32,895 --> 00:36:35,429
Here he comes, here he comes, he'll catch me!

466
00:36:38,322 --> 00:36:40,722
How tasty it was!

467
00:36:40,915 --> 00:36:42,915
Oh, what a blow!

468
00:36:48,308 --> 00:36:51,043
Oh, Bella, Mommy, wait for me!

469
00:36:51,143 --> 00:36:54,143
Wait for me, wait for me!

470
00:36:56,526 --> 00:36:59,502
By golly, I'm in the paper!

471
00:36:59,602 --> 00:37:03,802
When the burgomaster wife sees it, she'll be proud of me.

472
00:37:04,788 --> 00:37:08,388
Watch out, Otto, watch your driving, please!

473
00:37:09,233 --> 00:37:11,634
It's a beautiful trumpet.

474
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:15,996
All gold, with ruby keys. How it shines!

475
00:37:16,096 --> 00:37:19,896
It will be a very valuable prize for the winners of the contest.

476
00:37:22,831 --> 00:37:24,937
Look, Mr. Burgomaster.

477
00:37:25,037 --> 00:37:28,858
What? What's that tree doing interrupting the road?

478
00:37:28,958 --> 00:37:31,336
I don't know, sir, I didn't put it there.

479
00:37:31,436 --> 00:37:33,764
Put it out of the way immediately, by golly.

480
00:37:33,864 --> 00:37:37,723
Yes, sir. Right, sir. As you wish, sir.

481
00:37:38,031 --> 00:37:40,131
A cup of tea will calm me down.

482
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:45,350
How nice!

483
00:37:49,759 --> 00:37:54,377
But what are you doing running through the woods, Otto? Have you gone mad?

484
00:37:55,506 --> 00:37:57,226
What's this?

485
00:37:57,326 --> 00:38:01,326
-This is a robbery.
-That's it.

486
00:38:03,055 --> 00:38:06,396
What do you want? Who are you?

487
00:38:06,496 --> 00:38:09,797
Music lovers. Give me the trumpet, you fool old man.

488
00:38:10,148 --> 00:38:13,648
All right, boys, let's go, business is closed.

489
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:18,076
Wait! Put that log away, please!

490
00:38:18,176 --> 00:38:21,577
A log? Have you seen a log, boys?

491
00:38:22,368 --> 00:38:24,529
What, boss?

492
00:38:24,629 --> 00:38:26,461
What's a log, boss?

493
00:38:26,561 --> 00:38:29,960
I don't know, boys, that's the first I've heard of it.

494
00:38:30,383 --> 00:38:33,383
Well, let's get the hell out of here. Buzzing.

495
00:38:40,976 --> 00:38:42,976
Help!

496
00:38:47,708 --> 00:38:50,608
We've blown the burgomaster away.

497
00:38:50,859 --> 00:38:53,563
That was the easiest hit we've ever made.

498
00:38:53,663 --> 00:38:57,663
My collection of musical instruments grows larger every day.

499
00:38:58,356 --> 00:39:02,140
And why do you want so many musical instruments, Chef?

500
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,740
I was missing a trumpet, and this one is made of gold.

501
00:39:06,049 --> 00:39:10,549
Ah, yes, it's gold. How nice, we'll get a lot of money for it!

502
00:39:12,564 --> 00:39:15,881
Otto! Come back here, you coward!

503
00:39:15,981 --> 00:39:17,857
Help!

504
00:39:17,957 --> 00:39:20,758
I'll try to get this thing going.

505
00:39:22,654 --> 00:39:25,554
I can't find the brake.

506
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:30,213
Otto! Why won't you be here when I need you, you good-for-nothing!

507
00:39:30,313 --> 00:39:34,730
Otto, Otto, I'm going to get hit! Otto!

508
00:39:35,939 --> 00:39:37,899
We've been walking for a long time and we haven't come out of this wood.

509
00:39:37,999 --> 00:39:40,899
Aren't we just wandering around pointlessly?

510
00:39:42,937 --> 00:39:45,737
Someone is coming.

511
00:39:47,401 --> 00:39:49,119
I can see something chasing us.

512
00:39:49,219 --> 00:39:52,320
Hurry, let's hide behind that tree.

513
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:57,577
Stop, Otto! I'll finally find you. Stop, I'm the authority.

514
00:39:57,677 --> 00:40:00,977
Stop, you idiot! You won't escape!

515
00:40:05,189 --> 00:40:07,302
Have the thieves and the dog left already?

516
00:40:07,402 --> 00:40:11,202
Well, you'd better get down from that branch, Mr. Burgomaster.

517
00:40:11,405 --> 00:40:13,708
Don't fall off.

518
00:40:15,242 --> 00:40:18,495
Gee, I thought life in the forest was quieter!

519
00:40:18,595 --> 00:40:20,738
Let's get out of here as soon as possible.

520
00:40:20,838 --> 00:40:23,170
The important thing now is to find Koki.

521
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:25,344
Yes, but where?

522
00:40:25,444 --> 00:40:27,745
We have to keep looking.

523
00:40:59,919 --> 00:41:01,084
What's the matter?

524
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:04,684
A thunderstorm. I don't like thunder, it's bad luck.

525
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:09,901
Nonsense. There are always storms in spring.

526
00:41:10,001 --> 00:41:12,101
Watch out.

527
00:41:13,409 --> 00:41:15,928
It's raining. That's all.

528
00:41:16,028 --> 00:41:18,196
Well, I'm looking forward to the dawn,

529
00:41:18,296 --> 00:41:21,496
because when the night is over, it'll be daylight, and we'll able to see.

530
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:29,255
Well, if nothing happens I'd rather go on sleeping.

531
00:41:33,096 --> 00:41:35,635
Damn it, it's raining!

532
00:41:35,735 --> 00:41:41,563
Hurry up, rascals, we have to get to our headquarters quickly or we'll get like soup.

533
00:41:41,663 --> 00:41:43,534
Like three soups.

534
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:45,634
Giddap, gallop, Attila!

535
00:41:47,028 --> 00:41:50,028
We have visitors.

536
00:41:52,209 --> 00:41:55,925
People are coming and I don't like the look of them.

537
00:41:56,025 --> 00:41:58,124
What do the kids look like?

538
00:41:58,556 --> 00:42:01,156
Three strange guys and a dog.

539
00:42:04,009 --> 00:42:05,684
Wait, they're getting off their bikes.

540
00:42:05,784 --> 00:42:09,561
Three guys and a dog? Let me see.

541
00:42:09,661 --> 00:42:14,561
I suspected it, they're the strange dwellers of the house.

542
00:42:14,736 --> 00:42:16,971
This time they're back before dawn.

543
00:42:17,071 --> 00:42:19,572
We're going to have complications.

544
00:42:19,943 --> 00:42:22,743
Extra complication.

545
00:42:27,367 --> 00:42:31,567
Come over here. We'll study a plan to defend ourselves against these guys.

546
00:42:32,262 --> 00:42:37,822
Study? We'd better hide so they don't see us.

547
00:42:38,209 --> 00:42:43,361
Wait a minute, listen. I know how we can defend ourselves against these guys.

548
00:42:43,461 --> 00:42:47,407
They're thieves who believe in ghosts and stuff like that.

549
00:42:47,507 --> 00:42:50,264
And that music brings them luck.

550
00:42:50,364 --> 00:42:53,464
That's why they've stolen so many musical instruments.

551
00:42:53,732 --> 00:42:57,631
So I thought we'd give them a good musical scare.

552
00:42:57,917 --> 00:43:01,375
A musical scare? Let's see, explain.

553
00:43:01,475 --> 00:43:06,775
They'll give us a scare if they catch us here.

554
00:43:09,743 --> 00:43:14,343
Damn weather! I'll take a hot bath and have a drink to warm up.

555
00:43:15,752 --> 00:43:18,576
Chef, I say the bikes here are going to get wet.

556
00:43:18,676 --> 00:43:22,289
So what? I'm getting wet too, you beast,

557
00:43:22,389 --> 00:43:25,490
and I'm worth more than those damn bikes.

558
00:43:30,564 --> 00:43:34,556
Where the hell is the damn key?

559
00:43:34,656 --> 00:43:37,756
Wipe my shoes, Attila, they're full of mud.

560
00:43:41,533 --> 00:43:43,732
It's got to be here.

561
00:43:44,459 --> 00:43:48,086
No, it isn't. Let's see... Now... nothing.

562
00:43:48,186 --> 00:43:50,176
Your watch is slow, Chef.

563
00:43:50,276 --> 00:43:52,630
Where's that damn little key?

564
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:56,653
Damn it, I finally found it! It's right here.

565
00:43:56,753 --> 00:43:59,247
Freeze, Attila, you fleabag!

566
00:43:59,347 --> 00:44:01,747
Can't you see you're soaking me?

567
00:44:01,871 --> 00:44:05,030
The master doesn't want to get wet. It's just that once it rains, Squat.

568
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:08,531
Enough of this nonsense, rascals, come on, inside.

569
00:44:26,145 --> 00:44:28,074
What's that?

570
00:44:28,174 --> 00:44:32,974
It's the ghost of the cemetery that has these disorganized clothes.

571
00:44:34,773 --> 00:44:37,373
Retreat!

572
00:44:39,912 --> 00:44:43,212
What am I doing here? Help!

573
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:51,740
Our plan has worked.

574
00:44:55,738 --> 00:44:58,538
Heel, hurry up, dwarf.

575
00:44:59,856 --> 00:45:01,856
Wait for me, wait for me.

576
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:08,335
I hope those braggarts never set foot in my house again.

577
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:14,975
If they do, we'll just go back to dressing up as ghosts and that's it.

578
00:45:15,954 --> 00:45:17,954
Yeah, that's it.

579
00:45:18,134 --> 00:45:22,625
I don't think they'll be back. They've had enough excitement for tonight.

580
00:45:22,725 --> 00:45:25,425
Then we can go back to sleep.

581
00:45:26,395 --> 00:45:29,145
I'm sleepy.

582
00:45:29,245 --> 00:45:33,045
Sleep? I got a better idea, guys.

583
00:45:33,716 --> 00:45:37,568
A better idea than sleep? Bah! You're nuts, Koki.

584
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:38,941
What are you up to?

585
00:45:39,041 --> 00:45:44,020
It'll be dawn soon and we must be on our way to Bremen, right?

586
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:49,854
Then we'd better rehearse our show if we want to win the music contest.

587
00:45:49,954 --> 00:45:55,955
Fantastic idea, Koki, because if we rehearse we'll do better and win the prize.

588
00:45:59,169 --> 00:46:02,789
What a run, Chef!

589
00:46:02,889 --> 00:46:07,547
I can't take it anymore. I'm falling down.

590
00:46:07,647 --> 00:46:14,811
Gee, Chef, where's the trumpet you stole from the burgomaster? Have you lost it?

591
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:18,508
My trumpet! It's gone!

592
00:46:20,464 --> 00:46:23,380
-Com on, let's all look for it.
-Yes, Chef.

593
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,880
I want it to appear quickly.

594
00:46:26,318 --> 00:46:28,617
Well, I don't see it, Chef.

595
00:46:29,594 --> 00:46:32,594
It can't be far away, damn it.

596
00:46:33,253 --> 00:46:37,811
But where are you looking, you idiot? Do you think the trumpet has flown into the branches of the trees?

597
00:46:37,911 --> 00:46:43,411
You never know, Chef, where you least expect it, the hare jumps out.

598
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,600
Don't be an idiot, beast, look on the ground.

599
00:46:46,779 --> 00:46:51,779
It's useless, Chef, now I remember, the trumpet is not here.

600
00:46:52,148 --> 00:46:54,669
Do you know what that trumpet is worth?

601
00:46:54,769 --> 00:46:58,069
A lot of money, so no jokes.

602
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:01,499
But boss, I'm not kidding.

603
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:06,599
Now I remember, when we ran away from the ghost you didn't have the trumpet.

604
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,356
Let's go back to our lair.

605
00:47:11,456 --> 00:47:15,116
I must have dropped my trumpet there when I fought the ghost.

606
00:47:15,216 --> 00:47:17,090
I have to get it back.

607
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:18,961
Come on, hurry.

608
00:47:19,061 --> 00:47:25,092
But, Chef, how are we going to get into our lair with the ghost in it?

609
00:47:25,192 --> 00:47:28,894
Damn it! Are you going to be scared of a common ghost?

610
00:47:28,994 --> 00:47:31,946
Remember, we're tough guys.

611
00:47:32,046 --> 00:47:36,346
-Yes, Chef.
-Tough guys? What a job we do!

612
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:46,543
Go ahead, beast, and spy on that ghost.

613
00:47:46,643 --> 00:47:48,643
We will attack him by surprise.

614
00:47:49,185 --> 00:47:52,348
Why do I have to be the one to spy?

615
00:47:52,448 --> 00:47:55,048
Why don't we draw lots?

616
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:58,235
I've already drawn lots and it's your turn, you rascal.

617
00:47:58,335 --> 00:48:00,021
Go with Attila. Let's go.

618
00:48:00,121 --> 00:48:02,616
What's the matter with you? You scared?

619
00:48:02,716 --> 00:48:05,232
You're supposed to be a fierce mutt.

620
00:48:05,332 --> 00:48:07,631
Shame on you.

621
00:48:08,038 --> 00:48:12,518
I know how to give Attila courage, Chef. You'll see.

622
00:48:19,623 --> 00:48:23,140
You've done wrong entrusting them with such an important mission, Chef.

623
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:26,407
I think you should have gone to spy on the ghost yourself.

624
00:48:26,507 --> 00:48:28,314
That's what you're the boss for.

625
00:48:28,414 --> 00:48:30,491
I don't pay you to think, you idiot.

626
00:48:30,591 --> 00:48:33,939
I know I'm the boss, and that's why I know what I'm doing.

627
00:48:38,715 --> 00:48:42,616
Chef, you're going to be stunned.

628
00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:48,515
Spit out what you know, goddamn it.

629
00:48:48,615 --> 00:48:50,915
What did you idiots see?

630
00:48:51,614 --> 00:48:56,932
Well, we saw the...

631
00:48:57,032 --> 00:48:59,032
What? Huh?

632
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:04,890
# One, two, three, four, there's four of us,

633
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:07,509
# four guys, four, four,

634
00:49:07,609 --> 00:49:12,137
# and we present ourselves with this song, with this song.

635
00:49:12,237 --> 00:49:17,078
# Throughout the world we carry joy and good humor.

636
00:49:17,178 --> 00:49:19,838
# Life is fun, it's a song. #

637
00:49:19,938 --> 00:49:22,209
So those animals were the ghost?

638
00:49:22,309 --> 00:49:24,376
# -I am Koki the rooster.
# -I'm Lupo the dog.

639
00:49:24,476 --> 00:49:28,276
# -I'm Mocker the cat.
# -And I'm Silly, the donkey. #

640
00:49:31,747 --> 00:49:34,547
So they tricked us, the rascals.

641
00:49:36,766 --> 00:49:41,566
Do those intruders know what it means to invade Chef and his gang's lair?

642
00:49:43,192 --> 00:49:44,668
What was that?

643
00:49:44,768 --> 00:49:47,652
-The door.
-The thieves are back.

644
00:49:47,752 --> 00:49:49,627
Scary!

645
00:49:49,727 --> 00:49:52,214
Everybody freeze. Nobody move.

646
00:49:52,314 --> 00:49:55,180
-Surrender.
-That's it, that's it, surrender.

647
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,280
You, filthy dog, give me back my trumpet.

648
00:49:58,867 --> 00:50:00,867
What a scare!

649
00:50:01,644 --> 00:50:04,043
The trumpet, give it back to me at once.

650
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:19,079
I'll beat you to a pulp, you filthy cat. I hate cats.

651
00:50:30,205 --> 00:50:32,405
Give me that trumpet.

652
00:50:36,463 --> 00:50:39,992
My trumpet, give me back my trumpet! Oh, Squat!

653
00:50:40,092 --> 00:50:42,092
Here I come, Chef!

654
00:50:43,551 --> 00:50:45,372
You won't get away, you filthy cat.

655
00:50:45,472 --> 00:50:47,472
I've got it, Chef.

656
00:50:49,153 --> 00:50:51,153
Go after them, shorty.

657
00:50:52,961 --> 00:50:56,076
My trumpet! That damn dog's taking it!

658
00:50:56,176 --> 00:50:59,776
Get after that dog, quick, don't let him get away!

659
00:51:00,944 --> 00:51:02,944
Now you'll see.

660
00:51:04,896 --> 00:51:06,896
Take this, doggie.

661
00:51:09,736 --> 00:51:11,736
That's it!

662
00:51:12,289 --> 00:51:14,988
Squat, you're an idiot!

663
00:51:19,662 --> 00:51:22,806
It's a good thing we managed to escape.

664
00:51:22,906 --> 00:51:26,006
But first we taught them a good lesson.

665
00:51:26,569 --> 00:51:29,670
My house, I won't be able to go back to my house anymore.

666
00:51:29,863 --> 00:51:32,088
Forget about that gloomy house.

667
00:51:32,188 --> 00:51:35,453
Now we're going to Bremen to win a music contest.

668
00:51:35,553 --> 00:51:37,057
Lupo is right.

669
00:51:37,157 --> 00:51:41,852
If we had stayed in the robbers' den we wouldn't be able to go to Bremen.

670
00:51:41,952 --> 00:51:46,035
Of course, I don't think those thieves will be after us now that they've recovered their trumpet.

671
00:51:46,135 --> 00:51:48,635
And I haven't lost mine.

672
00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:51,236
This is not my trumpet!

673
00:51:51,336 --> 00:51:55,362
No, it's the trumpet those thieves took as loot to their lair.

674
00:51:55,462 --> 00:51:57,289
And now, what do we do?

675
00:51:57,389 --> 00:51:59,389
I'm going to test it.

676
00:52:01,506 --> 00:52:03,983
It's made of gold and rubies!

677
00:52:04,083 --> 00:52:06,083
It sounds great.

678
00:52:09,191 --> 00:52:10,818
Great, guys.

679
00:52:10,918 --> 00:52:13,918
Yeah, it's a win-win for Lupo.

680
00:52:17,395 --> 00:52:18,683
I'll tell you what we're going to do,

681
00:52:18,783 --> 00:52:23,169
we'll enter the contest, and then we'll find the owner of this trumpet and return it to him.

682
00:52:23,269 --> 00:52:26,117
Very good, Lupo, you always have great ideas.

683
00:52:26,217 --> 00:52:30,065
-And now, to Bremen.
-To Bremen!

684
00:52:39,477 --> 00:52:42,798
# We are the thieves Chef, Beast and Squat.

685
00:52:42,898 --> 00:52:46,491
# We steal from everyone in every corner.

686
00:52:46,591 --> 00:52:50,134
# There's no end to our prison.

687
00:52:50,234 --> 00:52:54,077
# No, no, no, Chef, Beast and Squat.

688
00:52:54,177 --> 00:52:57,250
# We are the best, we are champions

689
00:52:57,350 --> 00:53:01,044
# of the profession, Chef, Beast and Squat.

690
00:53:01,144 --> 00:53:04,432
# The masters of the forest, terror of travelers,

691
00:53:04,532 --> 00:53:08,466
# We've got a lair in a mansion.

692
00:53:08,566 --> 00:53:12,017
# And make strikes that pull back,

693
00:53:12,117 --> 00:53:15,613
# because we are, we are Chef, Beast and Squat.

694
00:53:15,713 --> 00:53:19,312
# Chef, Beast and Squat, Chef, Beast and Squat.

695
00:53:19,453 --> 00:53:23,053
# Chef, Beast and Squat, Chef, Beast and Squat.

696
00:53:42,772 --> 00:53:46,373
# We are the thieves Chef, Beast and Squat.

697
00:53:46,543 --> 00:53:50,003
# We steal from everyone in every nook and cranny.

698
00:53:50,103 --> 00:53:53,464
# There's no one who can stand our prison

699
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:57,335
# No, no, no, Chef, Beast and Squat.

700
00:53:57,435 --> 00:54:01,097
# We are the best, we are champions,

701
00:54:01,197 --> 00:54:04,497
# of the profession, Chef, Beast and Squa...  # Squat...

702
00:54:05,871 --> 00:54:11,065
Damn it! This is not the trumpet we swiped from the burgomaster.

703
00:54:12,089 --> 00:54:16,193
I just found out that that damned mutt took my trumpet.

704
00:54:16,293 --> 00:54:19,550
-It's not possible.
-It can't be, Chef.

705
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:22,114
I found it lying on the floor myself.

706
00:54:22,214 --> 00:54:26,019
That mutt gave it the switch when he ran off with his buddies

707
00:54:26,119 --> 00:54:30,020
and left us his filthy trumpet, taking the gold one with him.

708
00:54:30,535 --> 00:54:33,074
He fooled us like idiots.

709
00:54:33,174 --> 00:54:36,340
Come on, I have to get my trumpet back any way I can.

710
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,940
Those animals can't be far away.

711
00:54:39,175 --> 00:54:41,071
We're finally at the river, fellows.

712
00:54:41,171 --> 00:54:44,271
Soon we'll find a bridge and reach Bremen.

713
00:54:44,387 --> 00:54:47,088
I'm glad, I'm tired of walking.

714
00:54:47,294 --> 00:54:52,991
Let's go on. The robbers won't be able to catch us even if they found out we have the golden trumpet.

715
00:54:53,091 --> 00:54:54,961
And they'll be left with their noses in front of their heads

716
00:54:55,061 --> 00:54:57,361
and without the trumpet they stole.

717
00:55:03,239 --> 00:55:06,139
Come on, it seems that Attila has discovered tracks.

718
00:55:07,497 --> 00:55:09,825
They have recently passed this way.

719
00:55:09,925 --> 00:55:12,749
Come on, boys, we've got them.

720
00:55:12,849 --> 00:55:15,926
-Look, the shape the bridge is!
-We weren't counting on this.

721
00:55:16,026 --> 00:55:18,685
What do we do, if we can't do anything?

722
00:55:18,785 --> 00:55:21,264
We won't be able to participate in the music contest.

723
00:55:21,364 --> 00:55:25,164
Courage, boys, we'll wade the river and get to Bremen.

724
00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:28,851
Wade the river? I hate water.

725
00:55:28,951 --> 00:55:32,052
Cats are scared of water.

726
00:55:32,451 --> 00:55:35,951
I'll find a place where we can ford the river easily.

727
00:55:36,632 --> 00:55:39,262
Koki, don't go too far.

728
00:55:39,362 --> 00:55:41,662
It's foggy and you might get lost.

729
00:55:50,433 --> 00:55:53,132
I've wandered too far from my companions.

730
00:55:54,524 --> 00:55:57,724
-Koki.
-Koki!

731
00:55:57,915 --> 00:56:00,816
Where are you?

732
00:56:02,086 --> 00:56:04,048
Koki!

733
00:56:04,148 --> 00:56:09,448
Lupo, Silly, Mocker! Can you hear me?

734
00:56:11,109 --> 00:56:13,109
Koki!

735
00:56:13,712 --> 00:56:15,812
I'm coming, my friends!

736
00:56:16,004 --> 00:56:21,079
Wait for me! I thought I was lost, but it turns out...

737
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,280
Where have you been?

738
00:56:24,692 --> 00:56:26,793
But... But he's not here!

739
00:56:27,395 --> 00:56:30,600
-Yes, he just called us....
-We'll keep looking for him.

740
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:32,700
He's just not there.

741
00:56:35,192 --> 00:56:38,998
Damn, I can't see anything. Where could Beast be?

742
00:56:39,098 --> 00:56:42,698
Calm down, Chef, it's not easy to lose a pachyderm.

743
00:56:44,862 --> 00:56:47,116
You were asking for me, Chef?

744
00:56:47,216 --> 00:56:50,116
Well, here I am, and look what I've got.

745
00:56:51,130 --> 00:56:53,830
What's that?

746
00:56:54,124 --> 00:56:55,858
But it's the rooster!

747
00:56:55,958 --> 00:56:58,433
You should have caught the dog, you fool.

748
00:56:58,533 --> 00:57:01,768
Sure, the mutt is the one with the trumpet.

749
00:57:01,868 --> 00:57:04,368
What are you going to do with him, Beast?

750
00:57:04,493 --> 00:57:09,664
Roast him and eat him. I'll pluck it.

751
00:57:09,764 --> 00:57:13,305
What? You have to wring its neck first.

752
00:57:13,405 --> 00:57:17,966
Enough, there's no time to pluck or roast or eat rooster.

753
00:57:18,066 --> 00:57:20,121
Where's Attila?

754
00:57:20,221 --> 00:57:24,325
He went that way, Chef, following the tracks of the animals.

755
00:57:24,425 --> 00:57:28,425
Well, let's go. I said, stay close to him. Let's get going.

756
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:34,063
As soon as Chef gets his trumpet back, I'll sink my teeth into you.

757
00:57:36,731 --> 00:57:40,869
Where'd this critter come from? Help!

758
00:57:46,967 --> 00:57:48,967
Careful, Chef.

759
00:57:49,745 --> 00:57:53,045
I swear, Chef, it was a cow.

760
00:57:53,754 --> 00:57:58,291
Koki, are you all right? We finally found you!

761
00:57:58,391 --> 00:58:01,691
It's me, Bella. Don't you recognize me?

762
00:58:03,690 --> 00:58:07,598
Bella, Mommy, Ocarina! Where did you come from?

763
00:58:07,877 --> 00:58:11,877
We'll tell you later, now we must get away from here.

764
00:58:13,348 --> 00:58:17,351
I lost my friends here, and just as I was about to find them, I got caught by the giant.

765
00:58:17,451 --> 00:58:21,396
I'm sure Lupo, Silly and Mocker can't be far away.

766
00:58:21,496 --> 00:58:26,297
Silly, Lupo, Mocker!

767
00:58:26,458 --> 00:58:29,458
Folks, I'm here!

768
00:58:29,559 --> 00:58:31,859
It's Koki. Let's go, guys.

769
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:34,650
Koki!

770
00:58:34,852 --> 00:58:38,166
It's them! Hey, guys! What's up?!

771
00:58:38,266 --> 00:58:40,139
We finally found you!

772
00:58:40,239 --> 00:58:42,438
But where did you come from?

773
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:45,103
I was captured by thieves but someone helped me escape.

774
00:58:45,203 --> 00:58:49,158
-Who?
-They'll explain it to you.

775
00:58:49,258 --> 00:58:52,758
Come, girls! This is Lupo, Silly, and Mocker.

776
00:58:53,361 --> 00:58:57,258
-Girls?
-Girls? Girls!

777
00:58:57,358 --> 00:58:59,358
Gee, girls!

778
00:58:59,591 --> 00:59:03,309
My friends from the farm: Bella, Ocarina, and Mommy.

779
00:59:03,409 --> 00:59:06,293
Hi, guys. Koki has told us a lot about you.

780
00:59:06,393 --> 00:59:08,393
-Hi, guys.
-Hi.

781
00:59:10,508 --> 00:59:12,662
Welcome to the group, girls.

782
00:59:12,762 --> 00:59:15,348
Well, well... What's up, cuties?

783
00:59:15,448 --> 00:59:19,051
What are you doing in the woods? Did you run away from the farm, like Koki?

784
00:59:19,151 --> 00:59:22,426
Of course, you have the same adventurous spirit as I do.

785
00:59:22,526 --> 00:59:24,754
It's great that you came!

786
00:59:24,854 --> 00:59:27,431
We're going to have a great time, my pretties.

787
00:59:27,531 --> 00:59:29,736
Come on, let's go to Bremen.

788
00:59:29,836 --> 00:59:32,836
-Yes, all together.
-You have to win the contest.

789
00:59:33,213 --> 00:59:36,013
Look what's here, isn't it wonderful?

790
00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:38,505
This log will help us ford the river.

791
00:59:38,605 --> 00:59:40,743
I'll keep watch while you guys throw the log in the water.

792
00:59:40,843 --> 00:59:43,743
Come on, boys, move it, move it!

793
00:59:45,841 --> 00:59:49,141
I'm not letting those stupid animals get away from me this time.

794
00:59:49,948 --> 00:59:53,612
Come on, boys. They're almost ours.

795
00:59:53,712 --> 00:59:55,829
Come on, Silly, hurry up.

796
00:59:55,929 --> 00:59:59,030
It's just that it's moving so much.

797
00:59:59,458 --> 01:00:01,777
Hurry up, the thieves are coming!

798
01:00:01,877 --> 01:00:04,895
-Get them, boys!
-We've got them.

799
01:00:06,213 --> 01:00:08,714
Get them, Attila!

800
01:00:10,212 --> 01:00:12,412
Mocker!

801
01:00:13,561 --> 01:00:18,089
Damn it! They're getting away, do something, you idiots!

802
01:00:18,189 --> 01:00:20,407
Well, they're getting away, yes.

803
01:00:20,507 --> 01:00:22,906
But what are you doing, you useless fools?

804
01:00:27,846 --> 01:00:31,765
You idiots, useless! You're worthless.

805
01:00:31,865 --> 01:00:34,225
This dip will cool their spirits.

806
01:00:34,325 --> 01:00:36,925
Serves them right for wanting to hunt us.

807
01:00:37,075 --> 01:00:40,075
They won't bother us for the time being.

808
01:00:40,747 --> 01:00:43,546
Attention, friends, a whirlpool!

809
01:00:46,018 --> 01:00:48,718
We're being swept along by the current. We can't avoid it.

810
01:00:49,249 --> 01:00:51,419
I can't swim!

811
01:00:51,519 --> 01:00:53,619
Try to save yourselves as best you can.

812
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:58,520
We're going to sink.

813
01:00:59,551 --> 01:01:01,551
Don't leave me alone!

814
01:01:03,572 --> 01:01:06,572
Come on, Bella! We've got to catch him, Bella!

815
01:01:07,794 --> 01:01:09,794
I'm drowning!

816
01:01:10,105 --> 01:01:11,357
Air!

817
01:01:11,457 --> 01:01:13,857
The trumpet, it's sinking!

818
01:01:14,688 --> 01:01:16,788
I've got to pull it out!

819
01:01:22,045 --> 01:01:25,678
-Courage, Silly!
-Come on, Mommy!

820
01:01:27,759 --> 01:01:30,159
Keep going, Silly, you're getting there!

821
01:01:30,558 --> 01:01:32,558
Help!

822
01:01:33,706 --> 01:01:35,706
Lupo, help Mocker, he's drowning!

823
01:01:37,258 --> 01:01:39,258
Help me, help!

824
01:01:40,402 --> 01:01:42,902
He can't swim, I have to save him!

825
01:01:43,615 --> 01:01:47,429
-Help!
-Hold on, boy, hold on, I'm with you!

826
01:01:56,540 --> 01:02:00,139
Ocarina, you're saving too!

827
01:02:00,832 --> 01:02:03,532
Lupo and Mocker, did they drown?

828
01:02:06,143 --> 01:02:08,743
There they are!

829
01:02:09,649 --> 01:02:11,749
-Hurray!
-That's great!

830
01:02:13,565 --> 01:02:16,065
Now we can breathe easy.

831
01:02:17,711 --> 01:02:21,011
Hurry, we can still recover the trumpet.

832
01:02:21,536 --> 01:02:25,178
Hurry up, faster, Beast. We have to catch up with them.

833
01:02:25,278 --> 01:02:28,179
I just can't do it anymore.

834
01:02:29,355 --> 01:02:32,655
Well, you have to be able to do more than you can.

835
01:02:33,161 --> 01:02:35,763
You're the champion of fools.

836
01:02:38,239 --> 01:02:42,826
-Bad news, Chef.
-What's the matter now, shorty?

837
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:47,182
The boat's taking on water. Look, look. And it's sinking.

838
01:02:47,282 --> 01:02:49,283
What are you saying?

839
01:02:49,502 --> 01:02:51,502
That's what I'm saying, that we're sinking.

840
01:02:52,590 --> 01:02:55,277
Why didn't you tell me before, you idiot?

841
01:02:55,377 --> 01:02:57,324
You didn't ask.

842
01:02:57,424 --> 01:03:00,623
We're sinking! Do something, you fools!

843
01:03:01,332 --> 01:03:03,932
I'm doing what I can.

844
01:03:04,410 --> 01:03:08,910
This is no time for petting, you fleabag.

845
01:03:12,282 --> 01:03:14,682
We barely did it! Are you all right, Mocker?

846
01:03:15,342 --> 01:03:17,882
-What happened?
-You fell in the water, Mocker.

847
01:03:17,982 --> 01:03:21,880
But thanks to your seven cat lives and Lupo you're safe.

848
01:03:22,110 --> 01:03:25,110
It's lucky to have friends like you, Lupo.

849
01:03:28,101 --> 01:03:33,062
Well, everything turned out fine. I'm just sorry I lost the trumpet.

850
01:03:33,162 --> 01:03:34,562
The trumpet, huh?

851
01:03:34,662 --> 01:03:41,244
Surprise! You don't have to worry about the trumpet, Lupo.

852
01:03:41,344 --> 01:03:45,344
Here. I rescued it before it sank in the river.

853
01:03:45,745 --> 01:03:47,938
You're great, Ocarina!

854
01:03:48,038 --> 01:03:50,038
Let's see how it sounds.

855
01:03:50,550 --> 01:03:53,650
I guess it'll sound great, just like before.

856
01:03:57,693 --> 01:04:00,393
I've swallowed enough water for today.

857
01:04:00,756 --> 01:04:02,756
I'm sorry, kid.

858
01:04:04,835 --> 01:04:07,901
-Weren't we going to Bremen, boys?
-Go ahead, guys.

859
01:04:08,001 --> 01:04:10,001
Yes, let's go.

860
01:04:24,374 --> 01:04:27,975
Stop it, you fool, the water ran out half an hour ago.

861
01:04:29,179 --> 01:04:31,943
Come on, it's true. What a thing to happen!

862
01:04:32,043 --> 01:04:34,543
Every day you're more and more of an animal.

863
01:04:34,747 --> 01:04:39,452
Damn it, you're useless. We fell into the river because of you.

864
01:04:39,552 --> 01:04:42,156
But... the boat sank.

865
01:04:42,256 --> 01:04:46,256
You should have seen that it had a hole in it, you good-for-nothings.

866
01:04:46,861 --> 01:04:49,175
It doesn't matter, we can still recover the trumpet.

867
01:04:49,275 --> 01:04:51,210
-That's true.
-Yes, we can.

868
01:04:51,310 --> 01:04:54,810
Those animals aren't much ahead of us.

869
01:04:55,085 --> 01:04:57,986
By the way, where is Attila?

870
01:05:00,292 --> 01:05:05,327
Ah, there you are. Our clothes are dry. Let's go.

871
01:05:06,293 --> 01:05:09,093
What are you doing?

872
01:05:09,229 --> 01:05:12,628
Useless, I'm surrounded by useless people.

873
01:05:16,144 --> 01:05:18,211
See what's coming down the road, guys?

874
01:05:18,311 --> 01:05:21,758
Yes, Chef, it's a truck.

875
01:05:21,858 --> 01:05:23,964
Of course it's a truck, idiot.

876
01:05:24,064 --> 01:05:28,442
Well, it doesn't look like an idiot truck to me. It looks normal to me.

877
01:05:29,299 --> 01:05:32,999
Stop talking nonsense and listen carefully.

878
01:05:33,586 --> 01:05:36,086
Stop, stop!

879
01:05:36,984 --> 01:05:39,484
Stop.

880
01:05:40,281 --> 01:05:42,281
Come on, guys.

881
01:05:43,998 --> 01:05:45,778
Come on.

882
01:05:45,878 --> 01:05:49,187
What's the matter? Do you want me to take you somewhere?

883
01:05:49,287 --> 01:05:52,987
Yes, we're going to Bremen. Do you like the idea?

884
01:05:53,446 --> 01:05:56,095
To Bremen? But I'm not going there!

885
01:05:56,195 --> 01:05:59,814
-We are. Get out of here.
-What are you doing?

886
01:05:59,914 --> 01:06:02,563
Come on, guys, everybody up. We're getting out of here.

887
01:06:02,663 --> 01:06:05,533
Hey, you can't take my truck, you rascals.

888
01:06:05,633 --> 01:06:09,033
Shut your mouth, chatterbox, and get out of here.

889
01:06:09,793 --> 01:06:13,293
Attila, run, your land awaits you!

890
01:06:16,546 --> 01:06:21,646
You bandits, you thieves, give me back my truck! I'll call the police!

891
01:06:30,368 --> 01:06:32,550
Will it be long before we reach Bremen?

892
01:06:32,650 --> 01:06:36,750
I don't know if we'll make it in time, today is the day of the contest.

893
01:06:36,891 --> 01:06:38,991
There it is. Look.

894
01:06:39,204 --> 01:06:43,806
-We're almost there.
-At last!

895
01:06:44,218 --> 01:06:48,471
Yes, but... And the thieves, did they manage to ford the river?

896
01:06:48,571 --> 01:06:51,523
No way, their boat was sinking!

897
01:06:51,623 --> 01:06:55,456
And we're way ahead of them. Let's keep going, guys.

898
01:06:56,249 --> 01:07:00,048
Now we'll catch up with those critters before they reach Bremen.

899
01:07:01,262 --> 01:07:04,462
I think we're gonna have trouble, boys.

900
01:07:08,556 --> 01:07:14,656
But... Damn it, we're out of gas!

901
01:07:18,990 --> 01:07:21,893
Well, now we'll just have to push the truck, won't we?

902
01:07:21,993 --> 01:07:26,519
How funny is Beast, Chef, he said push!

903
01:07:26,619 --> 01:07:28,718
Enough talk. Everybody out.

904
01:07:30,042 --> 01:07:32,897
Geez, Chef, there's no need to get all worked up either.

905
01:07:32,997 --> 01:07:34,997
Let's get going.

906
01:07:42,912 --> 01:07:47,612
Damn, those animals must be coming to Bremen by now.

907
01:07:47,826 --> 01:07:51,051
Here are their tracks. I'm sure they've just passed.

908
01:07:51,151 --> 01:07:57,136
Bremen is too close and we don't want to be seen there.

909
01:07:57,236 --> 01:08:01,262
If the burgomaster recognizes us, he'll have the police all over us.

910
01:08:01,362 --> 01:08:04,162
I don't want to end up in jail.

911
01:08:04,937 --> 01:08:07,937
Neither do I.

912
01:08:08,718 --> 01:08:11,744
It would annoy the hell out of me.

913
01:08:11,844 --> 01:08:17,444
Calm down, boys, let the boss, that's me, do the talking for you.

914
01:08:18,121 --> 01:08:21,820
Open your ears, I've got a plan that can't fail.

915
01:09:06,997 --> 01:09:12,514
Oh, my goodness! Hurry up, dear, it's 12 o'clock and everyone's waiting impatiently.

916
01:09:12,614 --> 01:09:16,315
Hurry up, Otto, I've got to open the musical contest.

917
01:09:16,766 --> 01:09:21,441
Yes, yes, Mr. Burgomaster, it's just that this band is getting tangled up.

918
01:09:21,541 --> 01:09:26,301
Move over, move over, Otto. Let me do it.

919
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:30,289
You men are useless. That's it.

920
01:09:30,389 --> 01:09:34,389
I've always said you're the handsomest man in the world, my dear.

921
01:09:35,239 --> 01:09:39,239
"I've always said you're the handsomest man in the world, darling."

922
01:09:41,158 --> 01:09:43,930
-Otto!
-Madam?

923
01:09:44,030 --> 01:09:46,669
What are you doing standing there like a passerby?

924
01:09:46,769 --> 01:09:49,290
Run, man, bring the contest prize.

925
01:09:49,390 --> 01:09:51,390
Yes, madam burgomaster.

926
01:09:51,561 --> 01:09:56,383
Too bad they stole the golden trumpet for the winners of the music contest.

927
01:09:56,483 --> 01:10:00,483
Don't think twice, my dear, the new prize is also very nice.

928
01:10:02,705 --> 01:10:05,205
Well, here we are at last.

929
01:10:05,367 --> 01:10:09,611
-But we must hurry.
-Yes, it's been a while since 12 o'clock.

930
01:10:09,711 --> 01:10:13,311
Everyone must be in the square; there's no one in the street.

931
01:10:13,553 --> 01:10:16,853
They're performing, we can still make it in time.

932
01:10:31,645 --> 01:10:34,445
How boring, this music!

933
01:10:37,098 --> 01:10:40,182
Get out, off to the desert to bore the camels!

934
01:10:40,282 --> 01:10:43,082
Why don't you and your music go somewhere else?

935
01:10:48,625 --> 01:10:52,726
What's going on there? At last we're going to have some fun.

936
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:56,050
Are you going to do a circus act?

937
01:10:56,845 --> 01:10:59,345
But where did those come from?

938
01:11:00,049 --> 01:11:02,442
Did you escape from a farm?

939
01:11:02,542 --> 01:11:05,143
They're a hilarious bunch.

940
01:11:06,038 --> 01:11:09,838
It's the first time I've ever seen animals in a musical contest.

941
01:11:10,662 --> 01:11:15,377
Let them through. We've been bored enough listening to those bumbling musicians.

942
01:11:15,477 --> 01:11:19,178
We're just in time, otherwise there wouldn't be a contest.

943
01:11:19,563 --> 01:11:22,140
Besides, we've caused a sensation among the audience.

944
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:24,776
And we haven't even started our performance yet.

945
01:11:24,876 --> 01:11:27,142
Now they'll know what's music like, comrades.

946
01:11:27,242 --> 01:11:29,242
Well said, Lupo.

947
01:11:30,088 --> 01:11:32,787
It looks like they've already finished their performance.

948
01:11:32,944 --> 01:11:35,144
Get out of here!

949
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:43,700
What a mess did built up in a moment!

950
01:11:44,138 --> 01:11:46,143
They're finally gone!

951
01:11:46,243 --> 01:11:51,543
And now, if there's any musical ensemble that dares to compete...

952
01:11:51,820 --> 01:11:57,255
Yes. Here I see, but they're animals! That can't be true!

953
01:11:58,833 --> 01:12:02,882
Well, we've never had contestants like that before, but the rules don't forbid them.

954
01:12:02,982 --> 01:12:05,281
Come closer, it'll be fun.

955
01:12:05,381 --> 01:12:07,570
Coming through, coming through, I'm going to the manicure.

956
01:12:07,670 --> 01:12:08,779
What does she think he's doing?

957
01:12:08,879 --> 01:12:12,579
Please, gentlemen, let me pass, I'm a lady.

958
01:12:12,819 --> 01:12:15,140
Look who's coming.

959
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:17,918
Coming through, coming through, I'm late for the hairdresser.

960
01:12:18,018 --> 01:12:20,019
It's the thieves!

961
01:12:20,168 --> 01:12:23,150
Of course, they've disguised themselves so no one will recognize them.

962
01:12:23,250 --> 01:12:25,921
And they're coming to spoil our party, for sure.

963
01:12:26,021 --> 01:12:28,721
Come on, guys, there's no time to lose.

964
01:12:29,742 --> 01:12:31,832
Good luck, my friends!

965
01:12:31,932 --> 01:12:34,472
Look, look, Arturo, something's up!

966
01:12:34,572 --> 01:12:37,273
There they are. We'll snatch my trumpet from them.

967
01:12:37,373 --> 01:12:40,564
Fellas, we've got to catch them before they start playing.

968
01:12:40,664 --> 01:12:44,326
Leave them to me, Chef. I'll get them!

969
01:12:47,337 --> 01:12:49,337
What's going on?

970
01:12:54,113 --> 01:12:57,012
Come on, we have to help our friends.

971
01:12:58,028 --> 01:13:00,528
Come here, you stupid rooster.

972
01:13:01,947 --> 01:13:04,348
Get out of there, kitty.

973
01:13:05,043 --> 01:13:08,182
-Hurry, with them, Mommy.
-Give them a lesson.

974
01:13:09,809 --> 01:13:11,809
A bull!

975
01:13:15,645 --> 01:13:18,546
Great, now I'm having fun!

976
01:13:19,624 --> 01:13:21,624
Hey, bull!

977
01:13:35,191 --> 01:13:37,191
He's going to find out, that one.

978
01:13:40,977 --> 01:13:45,477
Oh, Arturo, I can't stand violence! I'm going to faint!

979
01:13:46,587 --> 01:13:49,287
My trumpet, my trumpet!

980
01:13:51,808 --> 01:13:54,109
Damn mutt!

981
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:59,899
What a funny show!

982
01:14:00,580 --> 01:14:03,080
Yes, they're great comedians.

983
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:07,941
I've got it, it's mine, just mine! Let's go, my friends!

984
01:14:08,417 --> 01:14:11,050
But... But they're the ones who stole my golden trumpet!

985
01:14:11,150 --> 01:14:14,650
And they show up here, right under my nose!

986
01:14:16,963 --> 01:14:22,069
Guards, stop those thieves in disguise, quickly!

987
01:14:22,169 --> 01:14:24,346
Aye, burgomaster.

988
01:14:24,446 --> 01:14:26,646
How amusing!

989
01:14:27,009 --> 01:14:29,153
Come on, don't let them escape!

990
01:14:29,253 --> 01:14:32,854
-I thought it was the other one.
-Come on, hurry up.

991
01:14:37,676 --> 01:14:39,676
Now we're really going to have fun.

992
01:14:41,411 --> 01:14:43,510
Stop, stop!

993
01:14:46,685 --> 01:14:50,785
The donkey's coming, help!

994
01:14:53,412 --> 01:14:55,592
Stop immediately!

995
01:14:55,692 --> 01:15:01,092
Yes, if you don't stop immediately... I can't take it anymore!

996
01:15:01,618 --> 01:15:03,122
Surrender!

997
01:15:03,222 --> 01:15:05,222
A truncheon.

998
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:09,700
Come on, Mommy, we'll cut them off around here.

999
01:15:17,838 --> 01:15:21,237
Is there anyone who has received a cheerleader's education?

1000
01:15:25,239 --> 01:15:28,567
You won't catch me. The trumpet is mine, mine alone.

1001
01:15:28,667 --> 01:15:34,067
I'll never give up.

1002
01:15:39,638 --> 01:15:41,937
This is the last straw!

1003
01:15:42,291 --> 01:15:44,391
Well, well.

1004
01:15:44,874 --> 01:15:46,334
I don't like it!

1005
01:15:46,434 --> 01:15:48,165
Great, we've got them all.

1006
01:15:48,265 --> 01:15:50,907
This year's contest is very lively, huh?

1007
01:15:51,007 --> 01:15:53,107
Yes.

1008
01:15:53,485 --> 01:15:56,785
You're going to spend a vacation in jail, you villains.

1009
01:15:56,997 --> 01:16:00,552
There are no bars to stop the great Chef. I'll escape.

1010
01:16:00,652 --> 01:16:04,548
-What about me and Squat, boss?
-Shut up, Beast.

1011
01:16:04,648 --> 01:16:08,448
I need a stick of gum and I can't get it out of my pocket.

1012
01:16:11,195 --> 01:16:16,557
This trumpet is a prize worthy of the city of Bremen for its best musicians.

1013
01:16:16,657 --> 01:16:20,601
I don't know how, but you guys rescued it from those thieves.

1014
01:16:20,701 --> 01:16:22,866
I will never forget it, my friends.

1015
01:16:22,966 --> 01:16:27,366
By the way, you're here to compete, aren't you?

1016
01:16:28,739 --> 01:16:32,940
Well... I guess you can go on stage now.

1017
01:16:33,114 --> 01:16:37,858
Well, let's see what you can do besides give me back my trumpet.

1018
01:16:37,958 --> 01:16:40,094
Look, they're going to play.

1019
01:16:40,194 --> 01:16:44,994
This is the first time we've had such fun and original contestants.

1020
01:16:45,209 --> 01:16:48,335
They're lovely little animals, aren't they?

1021
01:16:48,435 --> 01:16:53,522
Yes, my dear. You may begin. Go ahead with the music.

1022
01:17:09,278 --> 01:17:13,278
It's unbelievable, they play beautifully!

1023
01:17:27,634 --> 01:17:30,551
I'm having such a good time!

1024
01:17:31,058 --> 01:17:33,159
They're phenomenal!

1025
01:17:37,026 --> 01:17:39,426
Come on, darling, let's dance.

1026
01:17:40,044 --> 01:17:42,044
Let's dance, let's dance.

1027
01:17:44,531 --> 01:17:48,400
They seem to like it. Let's go to the end, boys.

1028
01:17:59,298 --> 01:18:01,916
Long live the four Bremen musicians!

1029
01:18:02,016 --> 01:18:05,964
Good, very good! That's the way to play, little ones!

1030
01:18:06,243 --> 01:18:09,906
-We'll be the "Bremen Musicians". How about that, Lupo?
-Fantastic, Mocker.

1031
01:18:10,596 --> 01:18:13,596
Today is the most exciting day of my life, Ocarina.

1032
01:18:13,925 --> 01:18:17,423
Well, I think we've won, boys.

1033
01:18:17,523 --> 01:18:20,622
Of course we've won. Look who's coming to give us the prize.

1034
01:18:21,794 --> 01:18:27,166
Well, well, you've earned it, my little friends.

1035

Congratulations, little ones.

1036
01:18:30,207 --> 01:18:35,806
It's been years since we've heard artists like you.

1037
01:18:36,627 --> 01:18:40,500
I, as burgomaster of the city of Bremen,

1038
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:43,901
have the honor of awarding you the first prize,

1039
01:18:44,001 --> 01:18:49,143
which is this beautiful golden trumpet that was stolen from me by those thieves

1040
01:18:49,243 --> 01:18:52,443
and thanks to you I have recovered.

1041
01:18:56,086 --> 01:18:58,086
Hooray, hooray, hooray!
