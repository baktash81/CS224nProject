1
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,677
<i>The Second World War</i>
<i>is coming to an end.</i>

2
00:01:16,844 --> 00:01:19,514
<i>Finland and the Soviet Union</i>

3
00:01:19,547 --> 00:01:22,382
<i>have signed</i>
<i>the Moscow Armistice</i>

4
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:26,186
<i>which decrees that Finland</i>
<i>must disarm the Nazis</i>

5
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:28,488
<i>and drive them out of Lapland.</i>

6
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:35,362
<i>The Nazis adopt</i>
<i>a scorched earth tactic</i>

7
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:38,766
<i>and destroy</i>
<i>all roads, bridges,</i>

8
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,235
<i>villages and towns</i>
<i>in their path.</i>

9
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:49,142
<i>Deep in the wilderness</i>
<i>of Lapland,</i>

10
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:54,314
<i>there is a man who has decided</i>
<i>to leave the war behind him.</i>

11
00:01:55,683 --> 00:01:56,784
<i>For good.</i>

12
00:02:57,512 --> 00:03:00,347
Yeah!

13
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:51,138
He's riding
to his death anyway.

14
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,178
Get off the horse!

15
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:46,220
Where do you think
you're going, old man?

16
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:49,289
There's nothing down there.
We made sure of that.

17
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,094
What do you got there?

18
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,645
This old fucker
is a gold miner.

19
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:20,555
You got gold in those bags?

20
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,196
Take a look at this!

21
00:15:32,634 --> 00:15:34,201
We're rich, boys!

22
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:40,340
You're dead!

23
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,322
Get down on your knees.

24
00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:57,124
These bags
are full of gold!

25
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:04,164
Get down on your knees,
grandpa!

26
00:16:06,467 --> 00:16:07,301
Huh?

27
00:16:10,471 --> 00:16:13,440
Shoot the fucker!

28
00:16:13,474 --> 00:16:15,543
Fuck him up!

29
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,585
Thanks for the gold!

30
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:28,021
We've got gold!

31
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:30,224
Thank you, old fuck...

32
00:23:29,176 --> 00:23:30,177
Wait.

33
00:24:31,238 --> 00:24:32,840
Now.

34
00:24:44,952 --> 00:24:46,253
Fire!

35
00:25:00,334 --> 00:25:01,702
Cease fire!

36
00:26:32,793 --> 00:26:33,794
Huh?

37
00:26:51,912 --> 00:26:52,980
You...

38
00:26:57,885 --> 00:26:58,986
and you.

39
00:27:00,154 --> 00:27:02,089
On the sides of the road, now!

40
00:27:34,455 --> 00:27:36,357
How many mines
did we bury here?

41
00:27:37,892 --> 00:27:38,993
All of them.

42
00:27:43,097 --> 00:27:45,666
Pick two of our female friends
and bring them to me.

43
00:27:47,368 --> 00:27:48,369
And some rope.

44
00:28:02,483 --> 00:28:03,817
You...

45
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:06,320
and you.

46
00:28:13,894 --> 00:28:14,895
Pick me.

47
00:29:22,597 --> 00:29:24,398
Thank you, General.

48
00:29:24,431 --> 00:29:26,233
I will pass on
the information.

49
00:29:27,134 --> 00:29:28,135
Over and out.

50
00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:35,109
The General,
he has given us orders.

51
00:29:35,142 --> 00:29:40,381
Turn back and head to Norway
from Finland immediately.

52
00:29:40,414 --> 00:29:43,050
Did you tell him he just
killed seven of our men?

53
00:29:43,083 --> 00:29:44,084
I did.

54
00:29:45,019 --> 00:29:46,020
And?

55
00:29:47,522 --> 00:29:49,023
He thinks we were lucky.

56
00:29:51,091 --> 00:29:52,293
Fucking lucky.

57
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:59,400
The dog tags belong
to a man named Aatami Korpi.

58
00:30:01,068 --> 00:30:05,439
He was a Finnish commando.
The most feared in his unit.

59
00:30:08,108 --> 00:30:11,045
The General said, and I quote,

60
00:30:12,112 --> 00:30:13,347
"He's one mean motherfucker

61
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,382
"that you do not
want to mess with."

62
00:30:19,286 --> 00:30:21,955
<i>He fought in the Winter War.</i>

63
00:30:21,989 --> 00:30:25,125
<i>Lost his home and his family</i>
<i>to the Russians.</i>

64
00:30:27,127 --> 00:30:30,230
<i>He became a ruthless,</i>
<i>vengeful soldier</i>

65
00:30:30,264 --> 00:30:31,965
<i>who took orders from no one.</i>

66
00:30:33,601 --> 00:30:38,005
<i>The Finns, they gave up trying</i>
<i>to discipline or control him.</i>

67
00:30:38,038 --> 00:30:39,406
<i>They just sent him out,</i>

68
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,110
<i>alone into the wilderness</i>
<i>to hunt Russian patrols.</i>

69
00:30:44,579 --> 00:30:46,947
He became a one-man
death squad.

70
00:30:53,153 --> 00:30:55,489
<i>The reports</i>
<i>are unconfirmed,</i>

71
00:30:55,523 --> 00:30:59,960
<i>but it looks like</i>
<i>he has over 300 Russian kills.</i>

72
00:31:01,495 --> 00:31:04,865
The Russians,
they gave him a name.

73
00:31:07,067 --> 00:31:08,536
They call him Koschei,

74
00:31:10,304 --> 00:31:11,472
"The Immortal."

75
00:31:13,608 --> 00:31:14,875
Immortal?

76
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:44,238
The road is clear, sir.

77
00:31:47,307 --> 00:31:49,376
We are going to follow
our orders, right?

78
00:31:52,112 --> 00:31:53,480
We are turning back?

79
00:31:56,183 --> 00:31:57,184
No.

80
00:31:59,253 --> 00:32:00,487
We are not turning back.

81
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:06,026
We are losing the war. We are.

82
00:32:07,428 --> 00:32:10,497
In a few months,
this all will be over for us.

83
00:32:12,734 --> 00:32:15,469
When we get back,
they will...

84
00:32:16,504 --> 00:32:17,672
hang us all.

85
00:32:23,678 --> 00:32:25,513
That gold is our way out.

86
00:34:44,151 --> 00:34:45,787
Eyes open!

87
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:49,824
Check the sides.

88
00:34:54,394 --> 00:34:55,630
Nothing here.

89
00:35:22,456 --> 00:35:24,291
Oh, wait,
I see movement.

90
00:35:25,225 --> 00:35:26,259
Don't fall behind!

91
00:35:53,921 --> 00:35:55,322
Hey, hey... Hey!

92
00:36:40,434 --> 00:36:41,769
Gasoline!

93
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:51,679
The dogs lost the scent!

94
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,387
What's happening?

95
00:37:01,856 --> 00:37:03,423
There's gasoline on the road.

96
00:37:04,926 --> 00:37:05,960
They are useless!

97
00:37:05,993 --> 00:37:08,428
Calm down, boy!

98
00:37:16,403 --> 00:37:17,404
Hey!

99
00:37:24,879 --> 00:37:25,947
Release the dog.

100
00:37:27,347 --> 00:37:28,583
Release the dog!

101
00:37:29,517 --> 00:37:30,752
Go on, boy!

102
00:37:39,827 --> 00:37:41,662
Finish him.

103
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:14,061
Immortal or not,
a man needs air.

104
00:38:57,437 --> 00:38:59,372
Now, get me the gold.

105
00:39:45,686 --> 00:39:48,455
Go after him! Now!

106
00:41:04,065 --> 00:41:06,167
One more meter
and I'll have you shot!

107
00:41:14,775 --> 00:41:16,777
Desertion is punishable
by death.

108
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,668
Fuck this.

109
00:42:43,264 --> 00:42:45,032
Hey!

110
00:42:45,866 --> 00:42:47,701
Come here.

111
00:42:51,739 --> 00:42:52,773
Find me a boat.

112
00:48:01,382 --> 00:48:02,650
Any last words?

113
00:48:08,723 --> 00:48:10,057
I didn't think so.

114
00:49:30,237 --> 00:49:31,371
For your troubles.

115
00:49:53,728 --> 00:49:55,062
Put the hat back on.

116
00:53:22,737 --> 00:53:24,806
This son of a bitch
is still alive.

117
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:29,811
Shoot the man

118
00:53:30,645 --> 00:53:31,879
and shoot the dog, too.

119
00:53:49,864 --> 00:53:50,932
And the dog!

120
00:53:55,603 --> 00:53:57,237
Shoot the fucking dog!

121
00:54:07,481 --> 00:54:08,482
Muller?

122
00:54:32,372 --> 00:54:33,440
Muller?

123
00:58:21,702 --> 00:58:22,837
The plane is ready.

124
00:58:23,637 --> 00:58:25,940
What about the rest
of our squad?

125
00:58:25,973 --> 00:58:28,242
They don't need us
to get to Norway.

126
00:58:28,275 --> 00:58:30,077
The boys have
a crateful of booze

127
00:58:30,111 --> 00:58:32,246
and a truckful of bitches.

128
00:58:32,279 --> 00:58:34,648
I'm sure they'll
figure something out.

129
00:58:35,216 --> 00:58:36,684
I would.

130
00:58:48,195 --> 00:58:50,765
The road is blocked.
Come and take a look at this.

131
00:58:53,667 --> 00:58:55,236
What's going on?

132
00:58:55,269 --> 00:58:57,038
There's something in the road.

133
00:59:35,009 --> 00:59:36,143
Is this the plane?

134
00:59:39,246 --> 00:59:40,815
No, idiot.

135
00:59:43,284 --> 00:59:44,718
This is something else.

136
01:00:13,447 --> 01:00:15,116
The pilot has been hanged.

137
01:00:24,091 --> 01:00:27,161
-That's my rope.
-What?

138
01:00:27,194 --> 01:00:29,663
That's the rope I used
to hang Korpi with.

139
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:41,942
Let's get the fuck
out of here.

140
01:00:44,111 --> 01:00:45,980
I recognize it, I swear.

141
01:00:47,281 --> 01:00:48,282
What's the order?

142
01:00:49,049 --> 01:00:51,385
Everybody move!

143
01:00:51,418 --> 01:00:53,888
- Start the engines.
- Come on, let's go.

144
01:01:03,197 --> 01:01:04,431
Let's go, go!

145
01:01:09,069 --> 01:01:10,337
Well?

146
01:01:14,175 --> 01:01:15,176
He's back.

147
01:01:18,746 --> 01:01:20,181
He's hanging from
a rope somewhere.

148
01:01:20,214 --> 01:01:21,282
He's dead.

149
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:28,455
-What's so fucking funny?
-Nothing.

150
01:01:28,489 --> 01:01:30,457
What the fuck
are you smiling for, then?

151
01:01:38,265 --> 01:01:42,203
Do you assholes really think
you have succeeded

152
01:01:42,236 --> 01:01:44,972
where hundreds of Russians
have died trying?

153
01:01:49,511 --> 01:01:50,978
We all know the story.

154
01:01:55,015 --> 01:01:57,885
You'll see what happens when
you take everything from him.

155
01:02:01,556 --> 01:02:02,856
He won't give up.

156
01:02:04,959 --> 01:02:06,260
He'll just keep coming back.

157
01:02:07,895 --> 01:02:09,763
Do you really believe
that he's immortal?

158
01:02:10,898 --> 01:02:11,999
No.

159
01:02:14,101 --> 01:02:15,769
He just refuses to die.

160
01:02:19,406 --> 01:02:22,276
We have a word for that
in Finland,

161
01:02:22,309 --> 01:02:23,978
but it's impossible
to translate.

162
01:02:25,179 --> 01:02:26,180
You see,

163
01:02:27,314 --> 01:02:29,450
this is not about
who's the strongest.

164
01:02:31,118 --> 01:02:32,853
This is about not giving up.

165
01:02:34,388 --> 01:02:35,489
And he won't.

166
01:02:37,925 --> 01:02:38,993
Ever.

167
01:02:44,865 --> 01:02:46,834
No matter what
you bitches are trying.

168
01:02:48,369 --> 01:02:49,937
You will make him stronger.

169
01:02:51,872 --> 01:02:53,007
So...

170
01:02:54,509 --> 01:02:56,210
what is so fucking funny,

171
01:02:57,579 --> 01:02:59,079
is that you...

172
01:03:01,915 --> 01:03:03,217
your boyfriend...

173
01:03:05,252 --> 01:03:08,523
and everything that is left
of your sorry-assed company...

174
01:03:10,558 --> 01:03:12,026
are already dead.

175
01:03:18,232 --> 01:03:20,034
What?

176
01:03:37,184 --> 01:03:38,285
Was that one of ours?

177
01:05:11,311 --> 01:05:12,346
Was that Jens?

178
01:05:40,742 --> 01:05:43,177
We almost ran
into the bitches.

179
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:45,312
Can somebody tell me
what the fuck is going on?

180
01:05:51,185 --> 01:05:52,986
Nothing. It's all good, sir.

181
01:06:43,571 --> 01:06:45,272
Sir.

182
01:06:45,305 --> 01:06:46,306
They're all dead.

183
01:06:49,209 --> 01:06:51,144
We are almost there.
Step on it!

184
01:07:13,467 --> 01:07:14,468
Wolf.

185
01:07:15,770 --> 01:07:17,539
Go out there and kill him.

186
01:07:26,179 --> 01:07:27,281
One,

187
01:07:27,749 --> 01:07:28,783
two,

188
01:07:29,449 --> 01:07:30,718
three!

189
01:08:22,604 --> 01:08:23,605
Keep going!

190
01:08:26,908 --> 01:08:28,108
Keep going.

191
01:08:49,262 --> 01:08:50,932
Please... Please...

192
01:09:09,349 --> 01:09:11,251
That's him, that's Koschei.

193
01:12:29,717 --> 01:12:30,785
Do you see him?

194
01:12:33,788 --> 01:12:36,090
Yep.
He's still down there.

195
01:13:07,088 --> 01:13:09,790
It's bad. It's bad, I need...

196
01:13:09,824 --> 01:13:12,026
If you're not dead,
you fly this fucking plane!

197
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:27,642
Did you hear that?

198
01:13:27,675 --> 01:13:29,710
It's nothing.
Just an old plane.

199
01:14:20,761 --> 01:14:22,697
We might have a problem.

200
01:17:04,425 --> 01:17:06,694
Die. Fucker!

201
01:17:06,727 --> 01:17:07,761
Why

202
01:17:07,795 --> 01:17:08,929
won't you

203
01:17:09,964 --> 01:17:10,965
die?

204
01:18:09,323 --> 01:18:10,958
Fuck you!
