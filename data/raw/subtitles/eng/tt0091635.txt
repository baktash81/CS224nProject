1
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,153
Hey, sweetheart, how about
I dry you off?

2
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,994
Hey, babe!

3
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,555
Okay, don't hit me.

4
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,396
This is a message from Sinclair.
He's coming to your party.

5
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,191
That's great. So, what do we have now?
A critic, two clients, three painters.

6
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,997
Should be three more clients
and Molly in the back room.

7
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,799
You should know how to do business.

8
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,115
Give me a break here.

9
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,994
I'm calling out for coffee.
Who wants what?

10
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,397
I want a chocolate croissant,
Sweet 'N Low and a coffee light.

11
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,994
Okay. You, Liz?

12
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,351
Hot tea with milk.

13
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,395
Hey, boss-man!

14
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,995
I'll have a hot water with lemon
and Sweet 'N Low.

15
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,839
Don't let them charge for it.

16
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,228
Slimming down, tubs?

17
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,354
I don't fast to lose weight.
I fast to save money.

18
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,996
No sales, we'll both be in the back.

19
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,072
- Did you get the dip?
- Yeah, wine cheddar.

20
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,192
What do we have now?

21
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,236
Olives, crackers, pâté, what else?

22
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,114
French ticklers, Spanish fly,
margarine.

23
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,395
- This guy's shy. You can't do that.
- All right, so all right.

24
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,556
- Bye.
- So, what's his name, Michael?

25
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,309
Sorry, love. Why?

26
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,797
Oh, my God.

27
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,872
Sinclair, he's a vegetarian.

28
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,558
String beans, romaine lettuce,
asparagus, carrots...

29
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,988
Hey, all right, okay.

30
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,954
More, free. Free, free, free.
No charge.

31
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,799
Okay, goodbye.

32
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,153
Hello.

33
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,635
- Imagine one caught in your throat.
- Can you imagine the songs they sing?

34
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,639
- Oh, such a romantic.
- Can I help you, ladies?

35
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,036
- Half a dozen birds.
- You clean me out.

36
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,356
What are you gonna do with them?

37
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,992
What do you think we're gonna do?

38
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,755
Eat them?

39
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,957
No, we plan to give them
a proper burial.

40
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,594
That's very funny. Seriously.
Very funny.

41
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,999
Maybe we'll raise them as pets
and then fly them from the rooftops.

42
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,232
- Would you wrap them up?
- Yes, ma'am.

43
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,599
- Wrap them up.
- Yes, ma'am.

44
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,956
- Wrap them up. Let's go.
- Okay.

45
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,556
Let's see. What else?

46
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,835
Fortune cookies. About eight, no, 12.

47
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,997
Just wrap them with the rest.

48
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,394
Cab!

49
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,956
Stop, I'm pregnant!

50
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,393
Cab!

51
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,758
Coming at 8, huh?

52
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,152
Yeah, 8.

53
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,798
<i>Listen, why don 't you get</i>
<i>comfortable and I'll get it?</i>

54
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,635
Okay, come on, schmuck,
take your shirt off.

55
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,595
Come on, I haven't got all night.

56
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,668
You won't talk me into giving
a dinner party again.

57
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,877
It shows you're opening up.

58
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,388
I'm fine.

59
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,957
Soon you'll be putting
an ad in the personals columns.

60
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,038
"Beaut..." No.
"Divorced White Female.

61
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,992
Beautiful statuesque blonde.

62
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,558
Witty, cultured, owns own vibrator."

63
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,192
Oh, Lizzy...

64
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,039
I know you don't have one.
Not <i>vous.</i>

65
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,950
You are the grossest,
most perverted...

66
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,476
...oversexed, disgusting...
- Oh, my God!

67
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,551
Oh, baby!

68
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,395
Oh, Michael, yes!

69
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,955
He's eating Volkswagens.

70
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,835
I said to his agent, "How am I
supposed to review a piece like that?"

71
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,158
- How about a Volkswagen-tasting party?
- More wine?

72
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,391
Michael?

73
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,114
Anyone can do this
with his or her nose.

74
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,593
No, wait, wait. She did it!

75
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,758
Have you guys heard of this artist?

76
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,798
He's new. This is serious.

77
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,759
Come on, please, everyone,
let her tell the story.

78
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,869
Elizabeth does not lie.

79
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,355
She's blushing.

80
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,115
There's nudity and violence
in this, mark my word.

81
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,993
- Tell it, tell it.
- Come on.

82
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,112
A guy, he's an artist.

83
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,313
- He's done a series of portraits.
- What kind of portrait?

84
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,916
No, rectal portraits.

85
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,036
I know him.

86
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,999
He pulls down his pants,
puts the brush up his bum...

87
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,557
...and then paints portraits in a sort
of jack-knifed position.

88
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,559
It's the most amazing thing.

89
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,553
That's sort of the way you
write your reviews, isn't it?

90
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,958
Charming. Charming. Very charming.

91
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,029
To swimming with bowlegged women.

92
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,994
- It's beautiful.
- It is a beautiful shawl.

93
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,839
It's an old French shawl.

94
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,756
- How much?
- Three hundred dollars.

95
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,151
Is it really that much?

96
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,435
It's rock bottom.
Three hundred dollars.

97
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,392
Three hundred's a good price.

98
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,194
Thank you.

99
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,959
What's that?

100
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,552
It has babies!

101
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,109
- How much is it?
- For you, 40 big ones.

102
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,112
How about 30?

103
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,152
Thirty-five.

104
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:55,996
How about 30?

105
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,031
Okay.

106
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,795
Every time I see you
you're buying chickens.

107
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,955
Thirty.

108
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,958
- Every time I see you you're...
- What?

109
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,994
- You're smiling at me.
- Smiling at you?

110
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,755
Thank you.

111
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,959
This place has a lot of history.

112
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,435
The chair you're sitting in right now,
a guy named Gino Gambini...

113
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,756
...got his brains blown out...

114
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,357
...while he was eating the same thing
you are, linguine con cozze.

115
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,474
There was another guy.

116
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,879
Back in... Well, this was earlier,
this was in 1963.

117
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,879
Did you ever hear of Vito Posillipo?

118
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,633
No, I don't think so.

119
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,638
Would you like some more?

120
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,595
Vito Posillipo was sitting right over
there where that baby is.

121
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,595
He was minding his own business.
He was having ziti al forno.

122
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,958
They came in...

123
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,995
- You don't want any?
- No. Then what did they do?

124
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,992
Vito Posillipo came in...

125
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,635
Let me finish this.

126
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,797
Halloween night, sitting in back...

127
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,315
...minding his own business,
they gunned him down.

128
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,153
My God!

129
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,078
This place is what they call
a family restaurant.

130
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,194
Listen...

131
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,995
Do you recognize this?

132
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,999
John.

133
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,916
It's for you.

134
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,715
Don't say I didn't warn you, okay?

135
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,388
Is this yours?

136
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,988
No, it's a friend's.

137
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,988
Thanks.

138
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,994
It's beautiful.

139
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,315
It's so beautiful.

140
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,594
It's nice.

141
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,758
Is this your duck?

142
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,873
You're taking a lot for granted.

143
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,994
Am I?

144
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,714
That or you're practicing
to be a maid.

145
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,959
Do you like music?

146
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,595
Some.

147
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,993
It's Billie Holiday.

148
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,593
What do you do?

149
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,992
I buy and I sell money.

150
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,796
Some people call it arbitrage.

151
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,555
What do you call it?

152
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,074
I call it a living.

153
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,314
So you sleep with a telephone
under your pillow?

154
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,994
No, I don't do that.
I used to do that.

155
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,275
I don't have to do that now.

156
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,875
But your business is risky,
isn't it?

157
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,755
Well, it's not any riskier
than you coming here.

158
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,436
Here, where there's
no neighbors around.

159
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,392
We hardly know each other.

160
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,071
I don't know you.

161
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,958
You really don't know me.

162
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,520
I mean, there's no taxicab waiting
on the curb.

163
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,957
There's no phone booth outside.

164
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,995
There's no one to hear you
if you called out.

165
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,959
Just...

166
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,999
...you and me.

167
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,033
I don't like this. I want to go.

168
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,994
I was just kidding.

169
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,955
Now!

170
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,034
Right, we'll put this down, here.

171
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,596
We should go black, black, red, red.
That's it.

172
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,718
From this end to that end.
Black, black, red, red, black, black.

173
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,353
I think the dog collar belongs here.

174
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,636
It's not. It's a chastity belt.

175
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,796
It is?

176
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,758
Elizabeth.

177
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,518
Someone sent you flowers.

178
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,033
All right, don't do anything.

179
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,511
Where did she go?

180
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,395
Thank you.

181
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,638
Come with me.

182
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,997
- Send her up?
- Take her up.

183
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,599
John.

184
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,395
Bye.

185
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,635
John, I hate you.

186
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,557
Stop it.

187
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,997
Shall we get a cup of coffee?

188
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,153
John, let me down from here.

189
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,914
- You pig!
- See you later.

190
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,949
Get me down!

191
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,997
- Why don't you just calm down?
- I mean it.

192
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,995
Why don't you just calm down?
Why don't you just...

193
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,994
What is the matter?

194
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,195
Leaving me up there like that.

195
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,876
Slow down.

196
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,958
I see someone coming.

197
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,756
- Take this sucker for five dollars.
- Maybe even 10.

198
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,475
Sir?

199
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,836
You like music?

200
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:40,399
Do I like music? Look at these guys.
Who wants to know?

201
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,873
My brother. He can fart the theme
from <i>Jaws.</i> He's really amazing.

202
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,959
Wait a minute. He can what?

203
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,437
He can fart the theme to <i>Jaws.</i>
It's five dollars.

204
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:54,753
Five dollars? For five dollars
I can go out and buy the record.

205
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,355
- Too much.
- Oh, what about a buck?

206
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,993
You can do this for a buck?

207
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,073
Go ahead, do it and then
I'll give you the buck.

208
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,635
Give him a dollar. Who can do it?

209
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,799
I can. But we need the money first.

210
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,594
I'll tell you what...

211
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,988
...you hold the money.

212
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,392
Go ahead, hurry up, do it.

213
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,030
Look at him, he looks like
he's going to take off.

214
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,915
- That's it.
- That's it?

215
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,188
That's it?

216
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,794
What about:

217
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,635
He only does the first couple of bars.

218
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,439
Oh, no, give me the money back.

219
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,835
Come on, let's go.

220
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,228
<i>This is Dr. Holden 's office.</i>

221
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,956
<i>Just wanted to remind you,</i>
<i>you have an appointment tomorrow.</i>

222
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,595
<i>Hi, it's Scott.</i>

223
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,955
<i>We're going to Fire Island this</i>
<i>weekend. Want to come?</i>

224
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:14,992
That's my dad and me.

225
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,994
<i>This is Tom Miller</i>
<i>of Miller's Antiques.</i>

226
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,236
<i>Hello, I waited until ten.</i>
<i>Did you forget?</i>

227
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,954
<i>I'll speak to you later.</i>

228
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,152
That's Bruce.

229
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,873
He's a songwriter.

230
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,718
We were also married for three years.

231
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,995
Aren't you going to ask how I feel
about him now?

232
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,556
<i>Shit, I hate these machines.</i>

233
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,473
<i>Lizzy, this is your mother.</i>
<i>Remember me?</i>

234
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,355
<i>- You hungry for turkey?</i>
- That's my mom.

235
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,958
Take off your dress.

236
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,588
What?

237
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,508
Will you take off your dress?

238
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,992
May I blindfold you?

239
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,519
What if I don't want you to?

240
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,156
Well, you can ask me to leave.

241
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,798
I don't want you to leave.

242
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,399
Don't move.

243
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,595
No, no, don't move.

244
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,594
I want to look at the outline
of your body.

245
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,558
Does this frighten you?

246
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,954
Yes.

247
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,151
Does it excite you?

248
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,439
Yes.

249
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,993
It does me too.

250
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,353
Is he supposed to be dead or asleep?

251
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,870
I think he's sleeping.
I like to think of him sleeping.

252
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,913
It's by Matthew Farnsworth.

253
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,595
And nobody's ever heard of him,
I know.

254
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:57,357
But we're about to have a show
of his work at the gallery. Very soon.

255
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,195
I think he's a lovely artist.

256
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,958
How about it? How do you feel?

257
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,599
It just doesn't...

258
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,195
I don't know how to say it.

259
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,193
It just doesn't...

260
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,271
Do you like it?

261
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,195
Great. I think he's dying to get out.

262
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,797
Thank you, very much.
Come back and see us.

263
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,594
Excuse me.

264
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,755
Okay, boys.

265
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,155
- You smell good.
- Thanks.

266
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,799
It's nice.

267
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:28,995
May I sit down?

268
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,072
Of course. Make yourself at home.

269
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,994
Some chair.

270
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,392
You have a lot of TVs.

271
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,988
My uncle died watching TV.

272
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,957
He was a fanatic about sports.

273
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,313
I mean, any sports.

274
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,355
He had three TVs and a radio.

275
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,795
He used to run from room to room
just so he wouldn't miss anything.

276
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,954
He died of a heart attack.
'76 Olympics.

277
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,990
I've come close to a heart attack
myself watching these things.

278
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,993
I used to live in hotels
before I lived here.

279
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,074
I do like to cook.

280
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,835
- You like to cook.
- Love to cook.

281
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,758
I bought this for you.

282
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,038
Why don't you just hand it to me?

283
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,833
I like to watch you move.

284
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,275
Okay.

285
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,588
Open it.

286
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,388
God.

287
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,473
It's beautiful.

288
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,989
I love it.

289
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,993
Do you know they used to hypnotize
people with the sound of ticking?

290
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,994
You know that?

291
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,194
Let me hear it.

292
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,355
I hear it.

293
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,797
Can I ask you a question?

294
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,594
Okay.

295
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,552
It is beautiful.

296
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,755
What?

297
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,788
Elizabeth...

298
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,949
...each day at 12:00...

299
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,952
...would you look at that watch
and think of me touching you?

300
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,155
Yes.

301
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,998
Would you do that for me?

302
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,355
Yes.

303
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,155
Liz?

304
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,879
Sinclair's on the phone.

305
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,755
Who?

306
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,192
I don't believe she said that.

307
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,074
God, what does he want?

308
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,554
I don't know.

309
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,316
I think it's about Farnsworth.

310
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,033
- Here.
- No kidding.

311
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,994
Hello?

312
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,555
Sure, I'll hold.

313
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,915
Such a jerk.

314
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,719
I think I've been hypnotized.

315
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,477
A diet doctor tried it on me once.
I gained 10 pounds.

316
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,396
I can't concentrate.

317
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,158
I sprayed Lysol under my arms
this morning.

318
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,953
You brush your teeth with
Ben Gay?

319
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,271
Shaving cream.

320
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,153
Oh, you're all right.

321
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,191
Listen...

322
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,030
...your ex called. He wants to have
dinner tonight. Don't forget.

323
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,756
No, I can't.

324
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,755
Why not? Lizzy, I think you should.
He seems so sad lately.

325
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,555
You go.

326
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,399
You go in my place.

327
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,718
I don't think I'm his type.

328
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,958
Can I borrow your body?

329
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:17,916
Hello.

330
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,388
Molly.

331
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,795
Molly.

332
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,075
- There's a man on the premises.
- Terrific.

333
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,953
Great. Go to it.

334
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,075
Are these yours?

335
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,394
Yes.

336
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,072
It's nice. Come here.

337
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,513
I don't believe this.

338
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,797
I'm starving. Are you hungry?

339
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,755
Come on.

340
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,635
Don't move.

341
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,474
Stay right there.

342
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,798
I want you to close your eyes...

343
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,196
...and I want you
to slide on the floor.

344
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,953
Just lie down on the floor.

345
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,955
Come on.

346
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,595
Go ahead.

347
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,788
Close your eyes.

348
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,155
Don't peek.

349
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,794
I didn't.

350
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,555
Promise to keep your eyes closed?

351
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,799
A big one.

352
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,595
Promise to keep your eyes closed,
please.

353
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,475
Stick out your tongue.

354
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,032
Further. Further.

355
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,393
Further. Right.

356
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,311
Yeah.

357
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,797
I'll put it right on the spot.

358
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,155
Yeah.

359
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,192
Oh, that's nice.

360
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,153
I should have said no.

361
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:21,988
No, no, no.

362
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,953
I should have said no.

363
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,953
I would have if I could have...

364
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:29,028
...but I couldn't. So I didn't.

365
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,794
Are you talking to me?

366
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:40,955
Listen, Lizzy...

367
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,396
...you remember when you...

368
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,394
...suggested that I keep your date
with your ex?

369
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:48,995
Well...

370
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,594
...I did.

371
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,957
And the thing is, I couldn't say no.

372
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,594
I...

373
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,075
...slept with him.

374
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,955
With Bruce? My Bruce?

375
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,039
I thought you should know.

376
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,795
Well, your mom will like him.

377
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:20,871
Mine did.

378
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:25,755
Okay.

379
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,788
I'm going to a party tomorrow night
with Molly.

380
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:49,995
Will you come?

381
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,475
Come on, John.

382
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:56,955
No.

383
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,275
Why not?

384
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,796
I want you to meet my fr...

385
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,756
Don't you want to meet my friends?

386
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:12,073
I don't want to meet anybody.
I really don't want to meet anybody.

387
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,392
I just want to be with you.

388
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:22,999
I'll start the dishes.

389
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:24,588
Let me tell you something.

390
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:26,915
You don't do dishes.

391
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,194
You don't ever have to do dishes.
I'll do the dishes.

392
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,757
And I'll buy the groceries.

393
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,393
And I'll cook the food.

394
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:41,995
And I'll feed you.

395
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,956
And I'll dress you in the morning.

396
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,396
And I'll undress you at night.

397
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,958
And I'll bathe you.

398
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,797
And I'll take care of you.

399
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,118
And you can see your friends in the
daytime. I just want the nighttime...

400
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:03,873
...from now on to be...

401
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:05,395
...ours.

402
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,594
Yes?

403
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,588
Okay, fine.

404
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:26,954
Okay, I'll meet you.

405
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,433
I have to meet a friend.

406
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,995
That's okay.
I've got work to do at home.

407
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,998
No, I don't want you to go.

408
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,275
Would you please stay?

409
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,388
Okay.

410
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:54,994
<i>Fetch, boy.</i>

411
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,437
<i>Now you can afford that bed</i>
<i>that lets you read, eat...</i>

412
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,190
<i>... chat on the phone, watch TV, sleep</i>
<i>and relax at the touch of a button.</i>

413
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,633
<i>Now you can afford soothing, gentle</i>
<i>massage. Your personal heat control.</i>

414
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,194
<i>Total adjustability.</i>

415
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,518
<i>At last, an adjustable bed</i>
<i>at flat bed prices.</i>

416
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,194
Hello.

417
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,594
Hello.

418
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,188
Hello.

419
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,156
<i>- Elizabeth?</i>
- Yes.

420
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:24,755
<i>- Hi.</i>
- Hi.

421
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:27,793
<i>Don 't talk. I have a question</i>
<i>I want to ask you.</i>

422
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:28,996
Okay.

423
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:33,757
<i>All the while that I was with</i>
<i>my friend, I was just wondering...</i>

424
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,392
<i>... what you were doing in there.</i>

425
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,796
<i>I was wondering if maybe</i>
<i>you were going through my clothes...</i>

426
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,555
<i>... looking in my drawers...</i>

427
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:46,155
<i>... looking at the things in my closet.</i>

428
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,875
<i>And I said,</i>
<i>"No, she's not that kind of girl.</i>

429
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:51,998
<i>She's a good girl. "</i>

430
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:54,797
<i>Good girls don 't snoop, do they?</i>

431
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,794
<i>So come on, you can tell me.</i>

432
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,799
<i>Tell me if you've been a nosy parker.</i>

433
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,676
<i>I mean, come on.</i>
<i>Really, I want to know.</i>

434
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:06,355
<i>I'm your pal, right? So tell me.</i>

435
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:10,153
<i>You can trust me.</i>
<i>It'll be our secret.</i>

436
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,194
<i>So tell me.</i>

437
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,599
<i>Tell me.</i>

438
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,593
Yes.

439
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,797
- Yes.
<i>- What's that?</i>

440
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:29,993
<i>- Yes, what?</i>
- Yes, I've been a nosy parker.

441
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:31,993
<i>Shame on you.</i>

442
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,156
I didn't think you'd be here.

443
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:37,875
Why'd you do that?

444
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,593
I'm sorry.

445
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,717
You've been a very bad girl.

446
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:50,358
I want you to face the wall and raise
your skirt, because I'm gonna spank you.

447
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,399
You are kidding?

448
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,553
I'm not kidding.

449
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:05,759
Oh, God.

450
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:19,588
Who the fuck do you think you are?

451
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:03,999
Coming.

452
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,957
Your breakfast is ready.

453
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,552
Will that be cash or charge?

454
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,394
Cash.

455
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:30,195
John?

456
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,755
Aren't you going to ask me
how I like this?

457
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,115
No.

458
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:56,197
Did you take as good a care
of the others as you do of me?

459
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:02,795
Did you?

460
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:18,595
Come on, John.

461
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,195
- Say, "That is gross."
- That is...

462
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:22,999
...unacceptable.

463
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:46,479
Just go.

464
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:13,916
Hurry!

465
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,798
Where are we going?

466
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,913
I'm gonna take care of you.
