1
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:54,626
It's her! I know it's her!
She wants to tell us something!

2
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,168
<i>- We must do something!
- Sit down!</i>

3
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,137
<i>- Please!
- Hey!</i>

4
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:15,677
In the name of His Imperial Majesty
and the city of Vienna...

5
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:19,156
<i>I hereby arrest Eduard Abramovicz...</i>

6
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:22,126
Also known as Eisenheim
the Illusionist...

7
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:25,392
<i>on charges of disturbing public order...</i>

8
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:28,957
<i>Charlatanism and threats
against the empire!</i>

9
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:32,232
Leave him alone!

10
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:39,804
They're arresting him!
They're arresting Eisenheim!

11
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:05,436
Chief Inspector Uhl.

12
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:19,843
- You're late.
- My apologies, Your Highness.

13
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,888
I was attending to
the loose ends of the case.

14
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:26,789
- Are there still loose ends?
- Very few.

15
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:28,850
Did he do it again?

16
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:33,492
How does he do it?

17
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:36,057
<i>I'm afraid I still don't know.</i>

18
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:39,738
Did you ask him?

19
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:42,240
He's not talking at this point.

20
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:45,800
Well, I'm sure
you have... methods...

21
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:48,540
<i>for that kind of thing.</i>

22
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:52,984
I want you to put an end to it.

23
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:55,145
Surely you have something on him.

24
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:58,656
<i>Something from his past?</i>

25
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,128
Yes. Yes, I think I do.

26
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:13,670
<i>In fact, we know all about his life.</i>

27
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:18,733
<i>We've spoken to almost everyone
who ever knew him.</i>

28
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,175
<i>As a boy, I'm told
he had a chance encounter...</i>

29
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:30,120
<i>with a traveling magician.</i>

30
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:36,858
<i>Boy.</i>

31
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,196
<i>One version
of the story was that the man himself...</i>

32
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,995
<i>then vanished...</i>

33
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:18,195
<i>along with the tree.</i>

34
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,330
<i>Who knows what actually happened?</i>

35
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:39,250
<i>People began to think he had
some kind of special power...</i>

36
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:42,988
<i>or at least that
he was a bit different.</i>

37
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:49,925
<i>And then he met her.</i>

38
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,777
<i>- Don't drop it.
- Careful, you're going to trip.</i>

39
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:06,876
<i>- Drop it, you muck snipe.
- Oh! Watch out for that hole, alley rat!</i>

40
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,944
- Drop it!
- Come on.

41
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:23,831
<i>Pick a card.</i>

42
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:28,067
<i>Put it back in the deck.</i>

43
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:36,304
Now, watch.

44
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:52,655
<i>Duchess von Teschen, you can't be
in a place like this. They're peasants.</i>

45
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,324
Remember who you are.

46
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:27,491
<i>She was brought back to the castle...</i>

47
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,592
<i>and they were forbidden
to see each other.</i>

48
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:33,537
<i>But soon, they were doing just that.</i>

49
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:36,973
<i>Over the next few years, they could
always find a way to be together.</i>

50
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:40,479
Quick, come on.

51
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:48,216
<i>In China there's a magician
that could make anything disappear-</i>

52
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,687
<i>a house, a wagon, anything.</i>

53
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:55,250
<i>We'll go visit him. They can't stop us
if we want to be together.</i>

54
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:57,694
They'll never find us.

55
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,891
Do you promise
you'll take me with you?

56
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:03,401
One day I will.

57
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:07,166
One day we'll run away together.

58
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:09,230
We'll disappear.

59
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,449
There's a secret way to open it.

60
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:04,788
I wanted a picture.

61
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:26,274
Sophie, are you there?

62
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:32,818
<i>- We must hurry! They're coming!
- Duchess von Teschen!</i>

63
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:38,023
<i>Duchess von Teschen!</i>

64
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:42,295
<i>- Duchess von Teschen!
- Duchess von Teschen!</i>

65
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:48,470
<i>Make us disappear.
Make us disappear.</i>

66
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,975
<i>Duchess von Teschen!</i>

67
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,649
Stop. Stop.

68
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:05,617
- Don't do this.
- Let go!

69
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:09,627
- Let me go. Let go!
- Your father's waiting for you.

70
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:13,028
<i>- Let go!
- No!</i>

71
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:15,499
- Eduard!
- Please, let go!

72
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,798
- No!
- Let me go!

73
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:21,772
Let her go, please!

74
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:24,537
<i>- Let go! Stop it!
- Sophie!</i>

75
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,544
Eduard!

76
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:28,512
<i>- Sophie!
- Eduard!</i>

77
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,141
Sophie.

78
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:33,310
<i>Stay away from her, or next time...</i>

79
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:36,218
<i>we'll arrest you and your family.</i>

80
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:49,166
<i>What happened next remains a mystery.</i>

81
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:52,102
<i>We do know that
he traveled the world...</i>

82
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:55,038
<i>that he began to perform
his magic in public...</i>

83
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,837
<i>that he changed his name
to Eisenheim.</i>

84
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:03,346
<i>And then almost 15 years later...</i>

85
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:05,406
<i>he appeared in Vienna.</i>

86
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:14,756
<i>Life and death...</i>

87
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:18,263
space and time...

88
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:21,390
fate and chance.

89
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:25,028
These are the forces
of the universe.

90
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:27,868
Tonight, ladies and gentleman...

91
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:33,674
I present to you a man who has
unlocked these mysteries.

92
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,805
From the furthest corners
of the world...

93
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:39,647
where the dark arts
still hold sway...

94
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:42,585
he returns to us to demonstrate...

95
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:46,785
how nature's laws may be bent.

96
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:50,886
I give you... Eisenheim.

97
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:03,271
Might I borrow a handkerchief
from someone?

98
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:08,102
You, madam.

99
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,996
Thank you.

100
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:28,090
Ah, be patient.

101
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,192
Now, if you please.

102
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:36,269
<i>I would like to continue
with an examination of time.</i>

103
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:40,802
From the moment we enter this life,
we are in the flow of it.

104
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,579
We measure it and we mark it,
but we cannot defy it.

105
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:49,087
We cannot even speed it up
or slow it down.

106
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,548
Or can we?

107
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:57,159
Have we not each
experienced the sensation...

108
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:00,892
that a beautiful moment
seemed to pass too quickly...

109
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:03,696
and wished that
we could make it linger?

110
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:09,575
Or felt time slow on a dull day...

111
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:13,269
<i>and wished that we could
speed things up a bit?</i>

112
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:22,442
I assure you, they're quite real.

113
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:24,675
Is it real? Let's see.

114
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,151
And you, madam,
where is your handkerchief?

115
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,213
Bravo!

116
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:03,277
Very good.

117
00:17:06,491 --> 00:17:08,425
<i>Give us something, please.</i>

118
00:17:08,493 --> 00:17:12,259
- Please, give us something. Please.
- What's all this?

119
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:14,594
We're poor.

120
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,567
- Do you think you're poor?
- Yes.

121
00:17:19,137 --> 00:17:21,367
I want to show you something.

122
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,374
You're not poor.

123
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:27,469
You have everything
that you need right here.

124
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,537
Thank you.

125
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,907
Thank you.

126
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,911
Thank you.

127
00:17:36,988 --> 00:17:38,979
And that's yours.

128
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:43,458
And this too.

129
00:17:47,899 --> 00:17:50,333
I've got the magic one!

130
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:04,807
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

131
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:06,874
- Coffee?
- No.

132
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:10,183
- Strudel? I have two.
- Nothing, thank you.

133
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:16,687
You look very pleased with yourself.
How are the receipts?

134
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,889
<i>- Not bad. A three-quarter house.
- Well done.</i>

135
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:21,364
But we're going to do better
than that. Listen to this.

136
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:25,199
Listen. "There is no argument
that his uncanny displays...

137
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:29,866
"separate him from the ranks
of garden-variety stage wizards.

138
00:18:29,941 --> 00:18:32,808
"Some of his effects
transcend mere illusion...

139
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:35,938
"and approach the realm of art.

140
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:39,142
He is very young
to be so masterful. "

141
00:18:39,217 --> 00:18:43,153
<i>Do you see?
We'll pack the house with this review.</i>

142
00:18:43,221 --> 00:18:45,655
We are going to make more money
than you ever dreamed of.

143
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:48,318
<i>But if it was mechanical.</i>

144
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:50,588
<i>Maybe he had it wrapped
in some kind of bark?</i>

145
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:52,721
Oh, I know, of course
I thought of that.

146
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,993
It's the butterflies
I'm trying to work out.

147
00:18:55,066 --> 00:18:57,557
Oh, for Pete's sake.
Invisible wire.

148
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,571
Too obvious. How many men
have you detailed for tonight?

149
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:03,233
We have eight men inside,
another eight out front.

150
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,674
<i>Perhaps you'll get another look
at your butterflies.</i>

151
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:07,234
Mmm.

152
00:19:11,516 --> 00:19:15,885
<i>- Come on in.
- Check the last 10 rows there.</i>

153
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,609
<i>You! Don't touch that!</i>

154
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,611
- Put that down!
- Ah, Herr Eisenheim.

155
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,909
Who are you and what do you
think you're doing?

156
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:46,439
I'm Chief Inspector Walter Uhl
and I'm inspecting your theater.

157
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,453
I've seen you perform.
Very impressive.

158
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:53,218
<i>- Very impressive.
- How can we help you, Inspector?</i>

159
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:55,851
You will be honored to know
the crown prince...

160
00:19:55,927 --> 00:19:57,918
plans to attend
your performance tonight.

161
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:00,089
<i>- The crown prince?
- Yes!</i>

162
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:02,599
<i>So, obviously we have
to inspect the theater.</i>

163
00:20:02,667 --> 00:20:04,862
I think that one's small
for an assassin, don't you?

164
00:20:04,936 --> 00:20:08,599
Yes, the orange tree.

165
00:20:08,673 --> 00:20:11,005
You know, I have seen things
like this before...

166
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:14,637
but never one like that.

167
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,647
- Extraordinary.
- Thank you.

168
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,684
I have been puzzling
over how it works...

169
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:23,278
especially how the butterflies fly.

170
00:20:24,689 --> 00:20:27,658
I assure you,
your secret is safe with me.

171
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:31,822
I'm an officer of the law after all,
and a bit of an amateur conjurer.

172
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,195
- Are you really?
- Yes.

173
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:38,396
Well, card tricks, coins,
uh, sleight of hand, yes.

174
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,960
Hmm.

175
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:44,202
But nothing fancy.
Perhaps you'll give me a tip.

176
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:48,402
Yes, all right.

177
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,108
I'll show you one I'm very fond of.
Are you a gambling man?

178
00:20:51,182 --> 00:20:54,777
- On occasion, yes.
- I will bet you the secret of the orange tree...

179
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:58,050
that I can guess which hand
you place this in every time.

180
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:00,785
Excellent.

181
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:04,556
Put it in your fist, raise your hand
against your forehead...

182
00:21:04,629 --> 00:21:07,621
<i>concentrate on it,
form a mental picture.</i>

183
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:09,633
<i>- Yes.
- Have you got it?</i>

184
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:12,363
<i>- Yes.
- Put your hands in front of you.</i>

185
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:18,306
It's in your left.

186
00:21:18,376 --> 00:21:20,310
- Well-
- A lucky guess, perhaps.

187
00:21:20,378 --> 00:21:22,573
You have a confederate
who signals you.

188
00:21:22,647 --> 00:21:25,639
- No. It's more primitive than that.
- Uh-huh.

189
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:29,915
When you raise your hand to your head,
the blood drains from it.

190
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:31,979
It will be paler every time.

191
00:21:36,027 --> 00:21:40,862
Oh. Oh, I like that very much.

192
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:43,366
Please take it with my compliments.

193
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:46,370
Why, thank you.
Eh, the blood drains.

194
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:50,033
Now, Inspector...

195
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:52,838
If you don't mind, I've got to prepare
for tonight's performance.

196
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:56,210
Ah.

197
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:08,124
<i>Please stand for His Imperial Highness...</i>

198
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:11,094
<i>Crown Prince Leopold.</i>

199
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:42,752
I thought we might end this evening
with a discussion of the soul.

200
00:22:42,827 --> 00:22:45,387
All of the greatest religions...

201
00:22:45,463 --> 00:22:49,661
speak of the soul's endurance
beyond the end of life.

202
00:22:49,734 --> 00:22:54,398
So, what then
does it mean... to die?

203
00:22:55,573 --> 00:22:58,303
<i>I need a volunteer
from the audience.</i>

204
00:22:58,376 --> 00:23:01,311
Someone not afraid of death.

205
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:05,675
Please, someone?

206
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,116
I assure you,
no tragedy will befall you.

207
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,142
It's an honor, Duchess von Teschen.

208
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:55,389
Do you know me?

209
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:58,299
No.

210
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:03,065
You're quite certain
that we've never met before?

211
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:04,870
Yes, of course.

212
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:22,523
Now please gaze
directly into my eyes.

213
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:24,653
Look nowhere else.

214
00:25:00,698 --> 00:25:02,689
Wave to yourself.

215
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:08,368
Turn in a circle.

216
00:25:14,879 --> 00:25:17,040
Now bow to yourself.

217
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:02,021
Away.

218
00:27:04,555 --> 00:27:08,821
They must have liked you. They've
waited for you nearly five minutes.

219
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:13,262
Your Highness, may I introduce
Eisenheim the Illusionist?

220
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:21,094
- Well done.
- Thank you for coming. I hope you enjoyed it.

221
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:23,970
Oh, we more than enjoyed it.

222
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:26,806
Stimulated great debate
amongst us, hasn't it?

223
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:29,278
Except of course for your assistant,
Duchess von Teschen.

224
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:32,111
You seemed to have struck her
quite speechless. A feat in itself.

225
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:35,949
- Did you hypnotize her?
- In a fashion.

226
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:39,080
<i>I'd like to learn that trick.</i>

227
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:44,459
<i>Rainier here thinks you have
supernatural powers.</i>

228
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:46,690
Do you claim supernatural powers?

229
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,433
I've never said anything
of that kind.

230
00:27:50,501 --> 00:27:53,402
- Then you won't mind a question or two.
- Now let's not ruin it.

231
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:56,804
<i>You needn't divulge
anything I can't guess.</i>

232
00:27:56,874 --> 00:27:58,569
As you wish.

233
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:00,736
Your assistants
are behind the mirror...

234
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:04,441
somewhere in robes obviously.

235
00:28:04,515 --> 00:28:08,042
Lights in the frame perhaps
to illuminate them, or angled mirrors?

236
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:11,088
That would be one way to do it.

237
00:28:11,155 --> 00:28:13,851
I think I understand it all
except the ghost.

238
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:15,984
That was very, very good.

239
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:18,961
Another viewing perhaps?

240
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:22,124
You must come to the Hofburg next time.
We'll make an evening of it.

241
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,828
That will be my pleasure.

242
00:28:24,902 --> 00:28:27,302
<i>So be it.</i>

243
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,738
Sophie?

244
00:28:36,814 --> 00:28:39,578
<i>And we'll gather
our best minds next time.</i>

245
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:41,618
You'll really have a challenge then.

246
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:44,553
Then I'll prepare something special.

247
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:46,681
Perhaps I'll make you disappear.

248
00:28:59,103 --> 00:29:01,970
My God.
When he volunteered her...

249
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:06,135
I heard the crashing sound
of money falling on me in piles.

250
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:09,202
Every lady of means in Vienna will
want to get up there with you now.

251
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,214
- Mmm.
- What a show-off.

252
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:13,944
His father would have died
if he had seen such a display.

253
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:17,545
- She didn't seem too happy about it either.
- She'd better get used to it.

254
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:21,023
- How's that?
- Word is she'll marry him soon.

255
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:24,619
- Really?
- Taking her chances if you ask me.

256
00:29:24,695 --> 00:29:27,357
- Why?
- He likes to give his lady friends...

257
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,900
a good thrashing now and again.

258
00:29:29,967 --> 00:29:32,026
People say he pushed one of them
off a balcony...

259
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:34,970
just to cover
the beating he'd given her.

260
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:05,501
For Herr Eisenheim.

261
00:30:47,175 --> 00:30:49,109
Hello, Sophie.

262
00:30:53,882 --> 00:30:58,114
<i>When I was on the stage,
you knew me right away.</i>

263
00:30:58,186 --> 00:31:00,882
It took me a moment...

264
00:31:00,956 --> 00:31:03,424
but, yes, I knew.

265
00:31:03,492 --> 00:31:05,926
You could have said something.

266
00:31:05,994 --> 00:31:08,087
I thought you'd figure
it out eventually.

267
00:31:08,163 --> 00:31:10,324
Yes, I would have.

268
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,890
I would have come another night,
volunteered...

269
00:31:12,968 --> 00:31:14,959
walked right on stage
and said, "Hello. "

270
00:31:15,037 --> 00:31:17,403
<i>And then you'd really
have had to move quickly.</i>

271
00:31:17,472 --> 00:31:19,736
I suspect you would have.

272
00:31:22,244 --> 00:31:24,235
I don't understand why.

273
00:31:28,417 --> 00:31:32,444
Perhaps for the same reasons you
find it prudent to meet in a carriage.

274
00:31:32,521 --> 00:31:35,922
It's just a game
I have to play with them.

275
00:31:37,659 --> 00:31:42,255
I'm followed everywhere. It's-
It's supposed to be for my protection.

276
00:31:44,433 --> 00:31:46,458
Yes.

277
00:31:46,535 --> 00:31:51,063
So, I hear congratulations
are in order.

278
00:31:51,139 --> 00:31:53,733
<i>What for?</i>

279
00:31:53,809 --> 00:31:56,141
They say you'll be the princess.

280
00:31:56,211 --> 00:31:59,544
- It's not decided at all.
- Ah.

281
00:32:00,882 --> 00:32:03,578
It makes a certain sense, I suppose.

282
00:32:03,652 --> 00:32:07,213
We've known each other for years,
and of course, our families.

283
00:32:07,289 --> 00:32:09,814
He's very intelligent.

284
00:32:09,891 --> 00:32:13,383
<i>A little too intelligent
for his own good.</i>

285
00:32:17,132 --> 00:32:20,124
You're lucky, you know...

286
00:32:20,202 --> 00:32:23,000
to have broken free as you did.

287
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,804
I often wish that I had-

288
00:32:30,946 --> 00:32:32,880
Wished what?

289
00:32:36,218 --> 00:32:38,812
Wished that I would see you again.

290
00:32:43,592 --> 00:32:45,651
And now you have.

291
00:32:47,796 --> 00:32:51,391
Yes, now I have.

292
00:32:58,407 --> 00:33:01,205
I look forward to seeing you
again at the Hofburg.

293
00:33:01,276 --> 00:33:03,608
Until then.

294
00:33:27,536 --> 00:33:29,561
Here's the report
on Duchess von Teschen.

295
00:33:29,638 --> 00:33:32,004
Mmm. Anything interesting?

296
00:33:32,074 --> 00:33:34,065
See for yourself.

297
00:33:41,183 --> 00:33:43,743
The magician?

298
00:33:43,819 --> 00:33:45,753
<i>They drove around for half an hour.</i>

299
00:33:45,821 --> 00:33:48,654
<i>Then he got out near the theater.</i>

300
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:54,727
<i>What do you want us to do?</i>

301
00:34:12,114 --> 00:34:15,106
Join us for a drink?

302
00:34:20,722 --> 00:34:23,020
Please.

303
00:34:33,368 --> 00:34:35,962
You like something to eat,
something to drink, hmm?

304
00:34:36,037 --> 00:34:38,301
- No, thank you.
- Herr Eisenheim...

305
00:34:38,373 --> 00:34:42,104
I'm going to ask you a question...

306
00:34:42,177 --> 00:34:44,168
that may not seem friendly...

307
00:34:44,246 --> 00:34:47,807
but I assure you, in fact, is.

308
00:34:49,718 --> 00:34:53,882
What is your relationship
with the Duchess von Teschen?

309
00:34:53,955 --> 00:34:56,685
You're right,
that doesn't seem friendly.

310
00:34:56,758 --> 00:34:59,226
Oh, but that is precisely my point.

311
00:34:59,294 --> 00:35:02,991
For, you see,
where others might judge...

312
00:35:03,064 --> 00:35:07,865
a discreet carriage ride
for what it seemed to be...

313
00:35:07,936 --> 00:35:11,531
I am willing to find out
what it actually was.

314
00:35:13,275 --> 00:35:16,005
All right. We were
childhood acquaintances.

315
00:35:16,077 --> 00:35:18,477
Acquaintances?

316
00:35:18,547 --> 00:35:20,845
Childhood friends.

317
00:35:20,916 --> 00:35:23,077
My father was a cabinetmaker.

318
00:35:23,151 --> 00:35:26,780
<i>He made the furniture
for her family's house.</i>

319
00:35:26,855 --> 00:35:30,188
I see, the cabinetmaker's son
friends with a-

320
00:35:30,258 --> 00:35:35,161
- Has there been a complaint?
- Oh, no, no. If there'd been a complaint...

321
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:38,722
well, we'd be having a very, uh,
different sort of conversation.

322
00:35:40,101 --> 00:35:44,731
Yes. He relies on you for
that sort of thing, does he?

323
00:35:44,806 --> 00:35:47,741
I'm a simple public servant,
Herr Eisenheim.

324
00:35:47,809 --> 00:35:49,868
That's not what I hear.

325
00:35:49,945 --> 00:35:53,608
I hear you'll be
the chief of police very soon.

326
00:35:53,682 --> 00:35:58,210
- Maybe mayor of Vienna? Party secretary?
- All subject to his whim.

327
00:35:58,286 --> 00:36:01,346
You better hope he doesn't dissolve
the parliament before you get there.

328
00:36:01,423 --> 00:36:05,883
Now the prince has some progressive ideas,
but he will make a fine emperor.

329
00:36:05,961 --> 00:36:09,727
Well, they say you're very close to him,
so I'm sure you'll do fine.

330
00:36:09,798 --> 00:36:15,600
Look. Yes, indeed, they say
that I'm very close to the prince.

331
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:20,801
But the simple truth of the matter is,
Herr Eisenheim, I'm the son of a butcher.

332
00:36:20,876 --> 00:36:24,937
He's the heir to the empire.
How close could we be to such as him?

333
00:36:25,013 --> 00:36:28,779
<i>Hmm? Do you see my point?</i>

334
00:36:33,154 --> 00:36:36,385
Don't fool yourself that
you can play in their game.

335
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:40,194
I've served on the edge of it...

336
00:36:40,262 --> 00:36:44,255
for... many, many years...

337
00:36:44,332 --> 00:36:46,425
and I can tell you with certainty...

338
00:36:46,501 --> 00:36:49,800
<i>there's no trick they haven't seen.</i>

339
00:36:53,441 --> 00:36:56,342
It's not worth it.

340
00:37:00,515 --> 00:37:03,177
<i>My guest tonight...</i>

341
00:37:03,251 --> 00:37:08,484
is not a showman at all,
but rather a wizard...

342
00:37:08,556 --> 00:37:12,083
<i>who has sold his soul
to the devil...</i>

343
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,596
<i>in return for unholy powers.</i>

344
00:37:15,664 --> 00:37:18,633
Or so at least some of our friends here
would have us believe.

345
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,134
<i>But fear not.</i>

346
00:37:21,202 --> 00:37:26,401
Everything can
and will be explained.

347
00:37:26,474 --> 00:37:31,002
<i>- All mysteries penetrated.
- Hear! Hear!</i>

348
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:34,139
<i>Well said! Well said!</i>

349
00:37:59,774 --> 00:38:02,504
<i>- Is that the emperor?
- Ah, yes, your father.</i>

350
00:38:02,577 --> 00:38:05,876
I didn't think he was invited.

351
00:38:07,549 --> 00:38:10,143
<i>Bravo.</i>

352
00:38:16,157 --> 00:38:19,558
A fair likeness of the old man.

353
00:38:19,627 --> 00:38:22,994
<i>Too modern a style for him, of course.</i>

354
00:38:23,064 --> 00:38:25,191
I'm afraid I'm not much
of a painter.

355
00:38:25,266 --> 00:38:28,531
It's true. There are no brushstrokes
in this painting.

356
00:38:28,603 --> 00:38:32,004
I can see that clearly.

357
00:38:32,073 --> 00:38:34,007
So to achieve the color...

358
00:38:34,075 --> 00:38:37,909
some sort of chemical must
be interacting, presumably.

359
00:38:37,979 --> 00:38:40,880
<i>Some sort of sprayer up your sleeve?</i>

360
00:38:40,949 --> 00:38:44,214
- May I?
- If you feel you must.

361
00:38:45,887 --> 00:38:49,584
- I do.
- Oh, let the man do his show.

362
00:38:49,657 --> 00:38:52,717
You want me to just sit there
when it's so obvious?

363
00:38:52,794 --> 00:38:55,126
I do.

364
00:38:55,196 --> 00:38:57,858
He tries to trick you.
I try to enlighten you.

365
00:38:57,932 --> 00:39:00,264
Which is the more noble pursuit?

366
00:39:00,335 --> 00:39:02,269
May we have the lights, please...

367
00:39:02,337 --> 00:39:04,635
so His Highness can better see?

368
00:39:04,706 --> 00:39:08,437
- See here, Leopold, let's have the show.
- Hear! Hear!

369
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:10,876
- Come on, Leopold.
- Get on with it.

370
00:39:10,945 --> 00:39:13,778
Very well. I propose a challenge.

371
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:18,783
<i>Why don't you astonish us...</i>

372
00:39:18,853 --> 00:39:21,185
if you can...

373
00:39:21,256 --> 00:39:25,659
without all the... gadgetry?

374
00:39:25,727 --> 00:39:28,287
As you wish.

375
00:39:30,165 --> 00:39:32,497
<i>Your sword is very beautiful.</i>

376
00:39:32,567 --> 00:39:34,296
Might I see it?

377
00:39:34,369 --> 00:39:36,360
Certainly.

378
00:39:39,007 --> 00:39:40,998
May I?

379
00:39:47,348 --> 00:39:49,976
Where does power flow from?

380
00:39:51,986 --> 00:39:55,683
Skill or destiny, or divine right?

381
00:39:57,859 --> 00:40:01,659
We all know the story
of a sword called Excalibur.

382
00:40:03,131 --> 00:40:06,862
Excalibur's blade
was fixed in stone...

383
00:40:10,472 --> 00:40:13,032
and there it stayed.

384
00:40:15,176 --> 00:40:19,772
Many worthy knights tried to
pull the sword from the stone.

385
00:40:19,848 --> 00:40:22,612
Only Arthur succeeded...

386
00:40:22,684 --> 00:40:24,652
proving his right to rule.

387
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:27,552
<i>Who can take this sword?</i>

388
00:40:27,622 --> 00:40:31,786
You, sir, can you take the sword?

389
00:40:52,814 --> 00:40:54,975
No surprise there.

390
00:40:55,049 --> 00:40:57,540
<i>Perhaps you, sir.</i>

391
00:40:59,487 --> 00:41:02,820
<i>Not so eager, cousin.</i>

392
00:41:05,727 --> 00:41:07,854
<i>Come on. You can do it.</i>

393
00:41:07,929 --> 00:41:11,421
<i>- Do it! Do it!
- Come on!</i>

394
00:41:18,673 --> 00:41:22,109
You shall live a long life.

395
00:41:22,177 --> 00:41:25,078
Thank you for your indulgence.

396
00:41:37,825 --> 00:41:40,589
Come now. If you can't pull it out,
you'll never be emperor.

397
00:41:40,662 --> 00:41:44,063
<i>Your father will live to be a hundred.</i>

398
00:41:55,977 --> 00:41:58,741
The sword to its rightful owner!

399
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:12,753
That's enough light entertainment
for this evening.

400
00:42:12,827 --> 00:42:16,991
For more serious discussion,
please join me for a drink.

401
00:42:29,911 --> 00:42:31,845
Shut him down.

402
00:42:31,913 --> 00:42:34,313
Well, he's very popular,
Your Highness.

403
00:42:34,382 --> 00:42:37,044
I'm sure you'll find a way.

404
00:42:43,424 --> 00:42:48,555
- What did you do to him?
- I gave him what he asked for.

405
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:51,098
What would possess you
to do something so foolish?

406
00:42:51,165 --> 00:42:56,068
<i>Duchess von Teschen,
you must come along, my dear.</i>

407
00:42:56,137 --> 00:42:59,197
We don't want to keep
the prince waiting.

408
00:42:59,274 --> 00:43:01,902
- Did you enjoy the show?
- It was wonderful, wasn't it?

409
00:43:01,976 --> 00:43:04,501
It was amusing.

410
00:43:41,616 --> 00:43:44,244
Who told you where to find me?

411
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:48,847
Your manager. I told him if he wants
to stay in Vienna, you need my help.

412
00:43:48,923 --> 00:43:51,483
Ah, so I'm to be driven
from the city, is that it?

413
00:43:51,559 --> 00:43:54,687
- Good. I shall relish it.
- Stop it!

414
00:43:56,431 --> 00:43:58,558
<i>I came here to try to help you.</i>

415
00:43:58,633 --> 00:44:02,330
Why? Why should you possibly
care what happens to me now?

416
00:44:02,403 --> 00:44:04,837
<i>You were my friend.
I am your friend.</i>

417
00:44:04,906 --> 00:44:09,843
We knew each other very briefly
a long time ago. You don't know me at all.

418
00:44:09,911 --> 00:44:14,814
Then why did you speak to me?
Why did you even bother talking-

419
00:45:30,725 --> 00:45:33,193
And you kept it all this time.

420
00:45:34,896 --> 00:45:38,559
I used to sit and stare
at your picture...

421
00:45:38,633 --> 00:45:41,124
trying to imagine where you were.

422
00:45:42,671 --> 00:45:47,506
At night I'd have dreams
I had gone with you...

423
00:45:47,576 --> 00:45:51,307
and then I'd wake up
and realize where I was.

424
00:45:58,787 --> 00:46:02,484
But in my dreams you
had shorter hair and no beard.

425
00:46:10,799 --> 00:46:14,257
Where did you go when you left?

426
00:46:16,671 --> 00:46:19,071
To my uncle's farm near Prague.

427
00:46:20,342 --> 00:46:22,333
How exotic.

428
00:46:25,647 --> 00:46:28,616
I went to Russia...

429
00:46:28,683 --> 00:46:30,617
then Asia Minor...

430
00:46:30,685 --> 00:46:33,279
and then the Orient for many years.

431
00:46:33,355 --> 00:46:35,687
So long.

432
00:46:35,757 --> 00:46:38,248
I always meant to return.

433
00:46:39,861 --> 00:46:44,798
I just- I kept thinking I'd find it
around the next corner.

434
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,891
What?

435
00:46:49,504 --> 00:46:51,438
A real mystery.

436
00:46:54,275 --> 00:46:56,402
I saw remarkable things...

437
00:46:56,478 --> 00:46:59,811
but the only mystery
I never solved was...

438
00:46:59,881 --> 00:47:02,941
why my heart couldn't let go of you.

439
00:47:24,039 --> 00:47:26,633
He wants me to go to Budapest...

440
00:47:26,708 --> 00:47:29,142
with him next week
to announce our engagement.

441
00:47:31,346 --> 00:47:35,112
He wants the Hungarians behind him.

442
00:47:35,183 --> 00:47:37,447
They're going to crown him king.

443
00:47:37,519 --> 00:47:40,283
I'm sure his father will have
something to say about that.

444
00:47:40,355 --> 00:47:42,585
He plans to overthrow his father.

445
00:47:43,858 --> 00:47:47,089
That could go very badly for him...

446
00:47:47,162 --> 00:47:49,096
and for you.

447
00:47:49,164 --> 00:47:51,132
<i>You shouldn't be involved.</i>

448
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:54,794
I am part of his plan.

449
00:47:54,869 --> 00:47:57,633
He only gets Hungary by
aligning himself with my family.

450
00:47:57,706 --> 00:48:01,938
- Leave him.
- It's not that easy.

451
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:05,776
Call it off and come away with me.

452
00:48:05,847 --> 00:48:11,479
<i>Or don't say anything
and we'll just go.</i>

453
00:48:11,553 --> 00:48:14,886
As long as we're alive...

454
00:48:14,956 --> 00:48:16,890
he'll hunt us.

455
00:48:16,958 --> 00:48:19,119
And when he finds us, he'll kill us.

456
00:48:32,574 --> 00:48:34,508
Look at me.

457
00:48:36,845 --> 00:48:40,144
<i>Do you truly want to leave with me?</i>

458
00:48:44,119 --> 00:48:47,680
Yes, I do.

459
00:49:23,958 --> 00:49:27,860
There you are. As I predicted,
they've shut us down.

460
00:49:27,929 --> 00:49:31,990
<i>Are you happy now, hmm?
You made your point.</i>

461
00:49:32,066 --> 00:49:34,830
<i>It doesn't matter that we were
sold out for the whole run!</i>

462
00:49:34,903 --> 00:49:38,964
No, look. You got it off your chest.

463
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,031
<i>- Do we have money?
- What?</i>

464
00:49:41,109 --> 00:49:44,010
- Do we have any money saved?
- Yes, we have some.

465
00:49:44,078 --> 00:49:46,410
But we could have had
much, much more.

466
00:49:46,481 --> 00:49:49,848
Mmm, it will have to do.

467
00:49:51,553 --> 00:49:53,714
And the second account, all of it.

468
00:49:53,788 --> 00:49:56,780
<i>Of course, Herr Eisenheim.</i>

469
00:50:00,962 --> 00:50:03,089
Thank you.

470
00:50:56,684 --> 00:50:59,585
And you have no doubt
it was Duchess von Teschen?

471
00:50:59,654 --> 00:51:03,055
I'd stake my life on it.

472
00:51:03,124 --> 00:51:05,490
What was in this suitcase?

473
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:07,551
I don't know.

474
00:51:17,805 --> 00:51:20,273
He's by the first car.

475
00:51:44,966 --> 00:51:47,730
<i>The map will show you where to meet.</i>

476
00:51:47,802 --> 00:51:52,000
<i>When it's done, you'll travel ahead
with her and I shall follow.</i>

477
00:51:52,073 --> 00:51:54,735
<i>And she understands
everything this entails?</i>

478
00:51:54,809 --> 00:51:59,337
<i>Completely. There's not a lot of time.</i>

479
00:52:29,911 --> 00:52:33,176
As you know, we sometimes follow...

480
00:52:33,247 --> 00:52:36,410
Duchess von Teschen
for her protection.

481
00:52:37,952 --> 00:52:40,785
Yesterday she was seen
in the company of another man.

482
00:52:40,855 --> 00:52:42,516
What man?

483
00:52:43,758 --> 00:52:46,249
Eisenheim the Illusionist.

484
00:52:46,327 --> 00:52:49,228
What were they doing?

485
00:52:49,297 --> 00:52:53,734
<i>- Well, they were meeting and, uh-
- Touching? Kissing?</i>

486
00:52:53,801 --> 00:52:55,462
Fornicating?

487
00:52:55,536 --> 00:52:59,063
Not that we observed, no.

488
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:02,473
However, I have reason to believe that
they may be planning something together.

489
00:53:03,978 --> 00:53:06,139
<i>It's possible they may be leaving.</i>

490
00:53:06,214 --> 00:53:08,876
I'm not certain of anything yet,
Your Highness.

491
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:11,111
Thank you, Inspector.

492
00:53:11,185 --> 00:53:14,382
<i>We can, of course, acquire more information-</i>

493
00:53:45,586 --> 00:53:48,555
He spent the afternoon
in Vienna with his father.

494
00:53:48,623 --> 00:53:51,091
He's expected shortly.

495
00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:25,488
What a surprise.

496
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:28,654
<i>I thought you didn't like it here.</i>

497
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,130
I suppose you think
you're very clever...

498
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:41,230
and very democratic
in your friendships.

499
00:54:41,309 --> 00:54:43,869
<i>- Aren't you?
- What are you talking about?</i>

500
00:54:43,945 --> 00:54:47,005
Your magician friend.

501
00:54:47,081 --> 00:54:49,379
I know you've been with him.

502
00:54:51,219 --> 00:54:55,019
It's true. We've been
friends since childhood.

503
00:54:55,089 --> 00:54:57,717
You sleep with all
your childhood friends?

504
00:54:57,792 --> 00:54:59,987
I will not be spoken to this way.

505
00:55:00,061 --> 00:55:03,553
- You'll be spoken to as I wish to speak to you!
- You're drunk.

506
00:55:03,631 --> 00:55:06,998
You're getting quite old,
aren't you?

507
00:55:07,068 --> 00:55:10,401
<i>You know, my mother was 16 years old
when she married my father.</i>

508
00:55:10,471 --> 00:55:14,202
And you? Can you even bear children?
Are you any use at all?

509
00:55:14,275 --> 00:55:17,711
- Are you trying to embarrass me?
- It has nothing to do with you.

510
00:55:17,778 --> 00:55:21,305
It has everything to do with me!

511
00:55:21,382 --> 00:55:24,681
You will not share my bed
if you've slept with him!

512
00:55:26,521 --> 00:55:29,115
You don't understand.

513
00:55:30,258 --> 00:55:32,624
I'm not going to share
your bed at all.

514
00:55:34,896 --> 00:55:38,764
I'm not going to Budapest with you.

515
00:55:38,833 --> 00:55:41,961
I don't want to be part
of what you're planning.

516
00:55:42,036 --> 00:55:44,231
And I will not marry you.

517
00:55:47,808 --> 00:55:51,403
<i>I assume you haven't been so stupid
as to tell him anything.</i>

518
00:55:51,479 --> 00:55:55,575
<i>'Cause if you disrupt my plans, I will have
no further use for you. Do you understand?</i>

519
00:56:02,657 --> 00:56:06,286
Now, you will travel
to Budapest tomorrow.

520
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:10,456
I recommend that you are here early,
packed and ready to go.

521
00:56:10,531 --> 00:56:13,227
<i>Do nothing more to embarrass me.</i>

522
00:56:14,468 --> 00:56:16,402
Good-bye.

523
00:56:19,707 --> 00:56:23,336
What do you mean, "Good-bye"?
Come back here.

524
00:56:27,848 --> 00:56:30,043
Come back here!

525
00:56:43,364 --> 00:56:47,027
<i>Don't disobey me again.
Whore!</i>

526
00:56:54,442 --> 00:56:56,637
<i>Out of my way.</i>

527
00:56:56,711 --> 00:57:00,442
<i>Please, don't.</i>

528
00:57:26,874 --> 00:57:30,207
No, leave that.
Leave all the lanterns.

529
00:58:36,476 --> 00:58:41,004
<i>Duchess von Teschen!</i>

530
00:58:41,081 --> 00:58:43,549
<i>Duchess von Teschen!</i>

531
00:58:52,525 --> 00:58:55,983
<i>Maybe look on that side!</i>

532
00:58:58,164 --> 00:59:00,997
<i>Over here!</i>

533
00:59:53,052 --> 00:59:56,351
Whoa. Whoa.

534
01:00:03,363 --> 01:00:05,593
I thought you saw her
get on the train with him.

535
01:00:05,665 --> 01:00:09,795
No, sir. We were waiting in Vienna
for them, but they left from Baden.

536
01:00:09,869 --> 01:00:12,201
<i>We assumed she was with him.</i>

537
01:00:12,272 --> 01:00:14,297
<i>Should I wire
the crown prince in Budapest?</i>

538
01:00:14,374 --> 01:00:16,842
<i>It's been done.</i>

539
01:00:16,910 --> 01:00:19,970
- Who are you?
- I'm the family's doctor.

540
01:00:20,046 --> 01:00:22,173
Are you the chief inspector?

541
01:00:22,248 --> 01:00:26,082
Yes, I am. You understand
this is a police matter now?

542
01:00:26,152 --> 01:00:29,747
- Of course I understand.
- Good, good.

543
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:33,088
<i>- You have determined the cause of death?
- She bled to death.</i>

544
01:00:33,159 --> 01:00:36,094
There's a wound on her throat...

545
01:00:36,162 --> 01:00:38,960
just above the left collarbone.

546
01:00:39,032 --> 01:00:41,432
Perhaps from a knife or a sword.

547
01:00:41,501 --> 01:00:43,765
May I take a look?

548
01:01:06,492 --> 01:01:08,960
Inspector, I-I will
not stand for it.

549
01:01:09,028 --> 01:01:11,656
The crown prince
will not stand for it.

550
01:01:11,731 --> 01:01:14,996
This is not some circus sideshow.

551
01:01:16,302 --> 01:01:19,032
My apologies, of course.

552
01:01:22,809 --> 01:01:25,903
Thank you, Doctor.

553
01:01:29,582 --> 01:01:33,245
Probably robbed.
Gypsies, maybe.

554
01:01:33,319 --> 01:01:35,810
Saw all those diamonds,
couldn't say no.

555
01:01:35,889 --> 01:01:40,451
Chief Inspector,
there's one thing you should know.

556
01:01:40,526 --> 01:01:43,825
<i>- Yes, what is that?
- In the folds of her dress...</i>

557
01:01:43,897 --> 01:01:47,628
I found this small gemstone.

558
01:02:04,550 --> 01:02:07,576
Seen last Thursday at 7:30 p. m.,
riding without an escort...

559
01:02:07,654 --> 01:02:09,588
toward the Imperial Hunting Lodge.

560
01:02:09,656 --> 01:02:13,251
Groomsman said
she arrived about 8:30.

561
01:02:13,326 --> 01:02:15,260
What was she doing riding alone?

562
01:02:18,731 --> 01:02:21,222
He did this.
You know he did.

563
01:02:21,301 --> 01:02:23,292
- I know who did what?
- The crown prince!

564
01:02:23,369 --> 01:02:25,599
He killed her. He's done it
before, and you know it.

565
01:02:25,672 --> 01:02:28,505
No, I don't know that. In fact,
I'm sure he didn't. He's in Budapest.

566
01:02:28,574 --> 01:02:32,032
- He killed her before he left!
- I'm afraid the facts don't support your theory.

567
01:02:34,647 --> 01:02:37,480
- She was leaving him.
- For who? You?

568
01:02:37,550 --> 01:02:39,848
- Yes!
- Don't be absurd, Herr Eisenheim.

569
01:02:39,919 --> 01:02:43,116
He killed her because
he couldn't let her go.

570
01:02:43,189 --> 01:02:46,181
- She knew his secret.
- What secret?

571
01:02:46,259 --> 01:02:48,227
- Ask your inspector. He knows-
- Stop this right now!

572
01:02:48,294 --> 01:02:52,560
Are you completely corrupt?

573
01:02:52,632 --> 01:02:56,728
No, not completely. No.

574
01:02:56,803 --> 01:03:01,831
Which is why I'll advise you not to accuse
anyone, especially His Imperial Highness.

575
01:03:01,908 --> 01:03:03,899
Or you will end up in jail yourself.

576
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,026
- Where's the guard who let her out of the gate?
- Gone with the crown prince.

577
01:03:30,103 --> 01:03:32,196
- Did any of the servants see her leave?
- All asleep.

578
01:03:32,271 --> 01:03:35,001
Ah-ha.
What about him?

579
01:03:35,074 --> 01:03:38,009
He, uh, he put her horse
in the first stall when she arrived.

580
01:03:38,077 --> 01:03:40,068
Ah.

581
01:03:43,649 --> 01:03:45,913
Was it this one?

582
01:03:55,261 --> 01:03:58,822
We don't have jurisdiction
on Imperial property.

583
01:03:58,898 --> 01:04:00,889
Thank you.
I know.

584
01:04:02,735 --> 01:04:05,260
So what are you doing?

585
01:04:07,306 --> 01:04:09,797
Investigating.

586
01:04:09,876 --> 01:04:12,242
Listening to that magician, are you?

587
01:04:15,314 --> 01:04:17,839
<i>For all we know, he did it.</i>

588
01:04:17,917 --> 01:04:20,249
No, I think not.

589
01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:22,719
<i>The crown prince is back.</i>

590
01:04:31,197 --> 01:04:33,563
<i>Chief Inspector.</i>

591
01:04:33,633 --> 01:04:37,569
<i>We should go. Now.</i>

592
01:04:41,441 --> 01:04:43,375
What have you found out?

593
01:04:43,443 --> 01:04:45,638
- She was last seen riding here, alone.
- Yes.

594
01:04:45,711 --> 01:04:49,203
And based on your information,
I then threw her out.

595
01:04:49,282 --> 01:04:53,013
- Did she commit suicide?
- No. It was surely murder.

596
01:04:53,086 --> 01:04:56,146
- Do you have a suspect?
- We will soon, Your Highness.

597
01:05:04,063 --> 01:05:08,124
<i>Later that week, we arrested
a man and charged him with murder...</i>

598
01:05:08,201 --> 01:05:12,297
<i>but I knew that
that wouldn't satisfy Eisenheim.</i>

599
01:05:17,477 --> 01:05:20,742
<i>I had my men continue to watch him.</i>

600
01:05:35,962 --> 01:05:39,796
<i>He finally emerged from his grief
and bought a rundown theater.</i>

601
01:05:39,866 --> 01:05:41,800
It's perfect.

602
01:05:48,141 --> 01:05:50,075
<i>He fired his manager...</i>

603
01:05:50,143 --> 01:05:53,943
<i>and began preparing
for a new kind of show.</i>

604
01:07:57,470 --> 01:07:59,461
<i>Who is he?</i>

605
01:08:01,307 --> 01:08:03,298
My name is Frankel.

606
01:08:05,611 --> 01:08:09,547
- Where did you come from?
- I come from Brunn.

607
01:08:09,615 --> 01:08:11,708
My father is a lens grinder there.

608
01:08:11,784 --> 01:08:14,719
How have you come
to be here tonight?

609
01:08:19,125 --> 01:08:22,288
<i>- I don't know.
- Are you alive?</i>

610
01:08:25,765 --> 01:08:28,029
<i>What can you tell us
about the other side?</i>

611
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:30,068
<i>- What's it like?
- Yes, tell us.</i>

612
01:08:30,136 --> 01:08:33,469
<i>You must know things. Secret things.</i>

613
01:08:33,539 --> 01:08:35,973
<i>Say something spiritual.</i>

614
01:08:57,296 --> 01:09:00,595
They don't seem
to think it's a trick.

615
01:09:00,666 --> 01:09:03,191
<i>Eisenheim! Come out and talk to us!</i>

616
01:09:08,941 --> 01:09:12,377
<i>Eisenheim's audience
had always been enthusiastic...</i>

617
01:09:12,445 --> 01:09:17,280
<i>but now he was attracting a more...
impassioned following.</i>

618
01:09:46,612 --> 01:09:48,546
<i>Madame. Please?</i>

619
01:09:57,390 --> 01:10:02,024
<i>With these spirits,
these manifestations...</i>

620
01:10:02,127 --> 01:10:05,028
Eisenheim has given us hard proof...

621
01:10:05,097 --> 01:10:07,565
of the soul's immortality.

622
01:10:07,633 --> 01:10:10,602
The spirit has been reaffirmed...

623
01:10:10,669 --> 01:10:13,934
<i>in the face of modern,
scientific materialism.</i>

624
01:10:14,006 --> 01:10:17,339
<i>The work of spiritualism
will rouse humanity...</i>

625
01:10:17,409 --> 01:10:19,934
to a new, moral earnestness.

626
01:10:20,012 --> 01:10:24,108
"It is a revolutionary movement,
and we will turn the empire...

627
01:10:24,183 --> 01:10:26,845
into a spiritual republic. "

628
01:10:26,919 --> 01:10:31,015
Do you think Eisenheim's behind all this?

629
01:10:37,229 --> 01:10:42,292
Why must I be bothered
with a magician?

630
01:10:42,367 --> 01:10:46,098
He is proving to be more
than a magician, Your Highness.

631
01:10:46,171 --> 01:10:49,766
He is a charlatan.
He's a faker.

632
01:10:49,842 --> 01:10:53,938
He pretends to have
supernatural powers-

633
01:10:55,447 --> 01:10:57,847
Put him on trial for fraud.

634
01:10:59,651 --> 01:11:01,949
- First, we have to show it is fraud.
- Then do it.

635
01:11:02,020 --> 01:11:04,318
Find out how the trick is done,
and then arrest him.

636
01:11:13,632 --> 01:11:16,123
This is just a rough demonstration,
Inspector.

637
01:11:16,201 --> 01:11:18,192
But you can see how it could work.

638
01:11:26,044 --> 01:11:29,138
Yes, I see.
Not bad, not bad.

639
01:11:33,152 --> 01:11:35,552
We need a spy in Eisenheim's troupe.

640
01:11:35,621 --> 01:11:38,215
- Those Orientals, they won't give us anything.
- Mm.

641
01:11:38,290 --> 01:11:41,316
- I already tried.
- Yeah. Then try something else.

642
01:13:00,272 --> 01:13:02,206
What has happened here?

643
01:13:02,274 --> 01:13:04,572
One of those ghosts from
the theater down the street.

644
01:13:04,643 --> 01:13:06,804
- Yes. Up there.
- Where?

645
01:13:06,879 --> 01:13:09,905
- There.
- Right there. And it's a boy.

646
01:13:09,982 --> 01:13:12,644
- Yes. Look, look.
- Sick!

647
01:13:15,854 --> 01:13:18,345
- Where is this thing?
- Right there.

648
01:13:18,423 --> 01:13:20,516
- Over there.
- Uh-huh. Did you see it?

649
01:13:20,592 --> 01:13:22,583
Mm!

650
01:13:25,230 --> 01:13:29,667
<i>God. An apparition. I saw it. I swear.</i>

651
01:13:29,735 --> 01:13:33,535
<i>- Yes!
- Right over there.</i>

652
01:14:24,623 --> 01:14:26,614
<i>Where are you taking him?</i>

653
01:14:32,431 --> 01:14:35,423
<i>I want to know how it's done.</i>

654
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:38,162
First the orange tree, now this.

655
01:14:38,236 --> 01:14:40,830
Do I have to share all my professional
secrets with the police?

656
01:14:40,906 --> 01:14:43,704
Well, in this case, yes,
or I'll be forced to arrest you.

657
01:14:43,775 --> 01:14:45,936
- On what charge?
- Oh, well, we'll start with fraud.

658
01:14:48,013 --> 01:14:50,038
- Excuse me, Chief Inspector-
- What?

659
01:14:50,115 --> 01:14:52,777
I think you should look
outside the window.

660
01:15:05,430 --> 01:15:08,593
- Who are they?
- They are here for him.

661
01:15:09,634 --> 01:15:11,966
<i>Oh!</i>

662
01:15:12,037 --> 01:15:15,200
My goodness, you have
a devoted following.

663
01:15:15,273 --> 01:15:18,868
- What is it they expect of you?
- I have no idea.

664
01:15:18,944 --> 01:15:21,344
What do your spies tell you?

665
01:15:21,413 --> 01:15:24,541
That you plan to subvert
the monarchy, perhaps.

666
01:15:24,616 --> 01:15:28,746
Why? Just because
the crown prince is a murderer?

667
01:15:30,255 --> 01:15:33,190
He's not a murderer.
We have the real murderer in prison.

668
01:15:33,258 --> 01:15:35,556
- He pleaded guilty.
- You've got the wrong man.

669
01:15:35,627 --> 01:15:38,960
- You don't know that.
- No, but you do.

670
01:15:40,399 --> 01:15:42,959
Hmm.

671
01:15:45,337 --> 01:15:48,204
Herr Eisenheim, you will
also go to prison...

672
01:15:48,273 --> 01:15:51,674
if you don't explain to me
what it is you are doing.

673
01:15:51,743 --> 01:15:55,577
<i>- Let him go!
- Or we will!</i>

674
01:15:55,647 --> 01:15:59,640
The sentence will be greater
if that mob attacks the building.

675
01:15:59,718 --> 01:16:02,619
<i>Eisenheim! Eisenheim! Eisenheim!</i>

676
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:06,282
<i>Well?</i>

677
01:16:08,226 --> 01:16:10,660
<i>What are you doing?
Stop!</i>

678
01:16:10,729 --> 01:16:12,924
<i>- Stop!
- Eisenheim!</i>

679
01:16:12,998 --> 01:16:15,296
<i>There he is!</i>

680
01:16:15,367 --> 01:16:17,597
<i>Listen to me, please!</i>

681
01:16:17,669 --> 01:16:21,332
<i>You must listen to me, please!</i>

682
01:16:23,708 --> 01:16:28,270
Thank you all for coming. I have been
speaking with the chief inspector.

683
01:16:28,346 --> 01:16:33,010
<i>And I think there's been
a serious misunderstanding.</i>

684
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:37,145
I want you all to know...

685
01:16:37,222 --> 01:16:41,283
that everything that you have seen
in my theater is an illusion.

686
01:16:41,359 --> 01:16:44,294
<i>It's a trick.</i>

687
01:16:44,362 --> 01:16:46,592
<i>It's not real.</i>

688
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:53,501
I can't bring loved ones
back from the grave.

689
01:16:53,572 --> 01:16:56,541
I can't receive messages
from the other side.

690
01:16:57,976 --> 01:17:00,809
I apologize if I've given
you any false hope.

691
01:17:00,879 --> 01:17:06,818
My intention has only been
to entertain, nothing more.

692
01:17:08,453 --> 01:17:12,719
<i>Now I appreciate your support.</i>

693
01:17:12,791 --> 01:17:15,021
<i>But you must go home.</i>

694
01:17:15,093 --> 01:17:18,028
Please, you must go.

695
01:17:30,075 --> 01:17:33,875
There, now. I've explained it,
so it can't be fraud.

696
01:17:35,981 --> 01:17:37,972
May I go?

697
01:17:59,471 --> 01:18:01,405
Has he tricked you?
Is that it?

698
01:18:03,074 --> 01:18:05,008
<i>No, Your Highness.</i>

699
01:18:05,076 --> 01:18:07,840
Then why are you failing me?

700
01:18:11,716 --> 01:18:14,014
I thought I could trust you.

701
01:18:15,687 --> 01:18:20,124
I thought you were a man I could bring
with me when I took the throne.

702
01:18:22,661 --> 01:18:25,824
- Am I wrong about you?
- No. You're not wrong, Your Highness, no.

703
01:18:25,897 --> 01:18:31,062
I need men who can complete
the tasks assigned to them!

704
01:18:38,710 --> 01:18:41,110
Instead, I'm surrounded by fools.

705
01:18:41,179 --> 01:18:45,081
<i>In the end, I must
do everything myself.</i>

706
01:18:45,150 --> 01:18:48,176
- I can see this case will be no different.
- Mm.

707
01:19:07,405 --> 01:19:11,842
- How do I look?
- Ordinary, Your Highness.

708
01:19:11,910 --> 01:19:13,844
Very ordinary.

709
01:19:18,016 --> 01:19:20,382
I think I'm going to enjoy this.

710
01:19:40,872 --> 01:19:45,605
- They don't recognize you.
- Good.

711
01:19:45,677 --> 01:19:49,738
And keep your distance. I don't want
to be seen with a policeman.

712
01:21:09,227 --> 01:21:12,128
<i>Who are you?</i>

713
01:21:12,197 --> 01:21:14,757
<i>Are you Duchess von Teschen?</i>

714
01:21:14,833 --> 01:21:16,767
Yes.

715
01:21:16,835 --> 01:21:18,894
<i>What's happened to you?</i>

716
01:21:18,970 --> 01:21:21,734
<i>She was murdered.
Were you murdered?</i>

717
01:21:24,576 --> 01:21:27,238
<i>By who?</i>

718
01:21:27,312 --> 01:21:29,246
<i>Did they arrest the right man?</i>

719
01:21:29,314 --> 01:21:32,442
<i>Tell us, please. Who murdered you?</i>

720
01:21:32,517 --> 01:21:35,452
<i>- Tell us.
- Someone. Here.</i>

721
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:38,250
<i>Tell us, and point him out.</i>

722
01:21:38,323 --> 01:21:40,314
<i>Was it the crown prince?</i>

723
01:21:40,392 --> 01:21:42,622
<i>He's killed a woman before!</i>

724
01:21:42,694 --> 01:21:44,855
<i>Hey! The crown prince isn't even here.</i>

725
01:21:44,929 --> 01:21:48,296
<i>The crown prince
killed her! Something must be done!</i>

726
01:22:15,126 --> 01:22:17,287
Chief Inspector, are you sure
you have the right man?

727
01:22:17,362 --> 01:22:20,263
- Quite sure. Excuse me.
- Did you investigate the crown prince?

728
01:22:20,331 --> 01:22:22,265
He cannot continue if this is true.

729
01:22:22,333 --> 01:22:24,267
- He must be brought to justice.
- It's not true.

730
01:22:24,335 --> 01:22:27,031
The magic trick is not evidence.
What is your name?

731
01:22:27,105 --> 01:22:30,666
- I don't see how that matters.
- I advise you to watch what you say, sir.

732
01:22:37,115 --> 01:22:40,312
That actress didn't even
look like Sophie.

733
01:22:40,385 --> 01:22:42,546
But the audience is
stupid and he knows it.

734
01:22:42,620 --> 01:22:46,818
He manipulates them.
He himself said nothing.

735
01:22:46,891 --> 01:22:48,825
His actress said nothing
inflammatory.

736
01:22:48,893 --> 01:22:51,157
He left it to the audience
to make their accusations.

737
01:22:51,229 --> 01:22:53,629
All plants paid for
by him, of course.

738
01:22:55,433 --> 01:22:57,560
I don't suppose you made
a note of those people?

739
01:22:57,635 --> 01:22:59,865
I'm afraid we didn't
have enough men tonight.

740
01:22:59,938 --> 01:23:02,998
<i>At the next performance,
I want them all arrested.</i>

741
01:23:03,074 --> 01:23:06,475
Every one of them.
Eisenheim, the whole troupe.

742
01:23:06,544 --> 01:23:09,775
I want to have an example
made of him...

743
01:23:09,848 --> 01:23:12,510
in front of all his followers.

744
01:23:15,987 --> 01:23:18,319
That was very foolish last night.

745
01:23:22,393 --> 01:23:24,953
You can't destroy him, you know.

746
01:23:25,029 --> 01:23:28,192
<i>- You can't bring down the monarchy.
- Oh, I know I can't.</i>

747
01:23:28,266 --> 01:23:30,530
Then don't raise her again.

748
01:23:30,602 --> 01:23:33,036
Don't provoke those questions.

749
01:23:37,709 --> 01:23:40,371
Eisenheim, I don't
want to arrest you.

750
01:23:43,248 --> 01:23:45,307
I'm a cynical man, God knows...

751
01:23:45,383 --> 01:23:48,375
but if your manifestations
are somehow real...

752
01:23:48,453 --> 01:23:51,479
then even I'm willing to admit,
you're a very special person.

753
01:23:51,556 --> 01:23:54,491
And if it's a trick,
then it's equally impressive.

754
01:23:54,559 --> 01:23:57,084
Either way, you have a gift.

755
01:23:57,161 --> 01:24:00,528
So don't make me put you in jail!

756
01:24:00,598 --> 01:24:02,828
Promise me you won't do it again.

757
01:24:02,901 --> 01:24:06,166
I promise you, you'll
enjoy this next show.

758
01:24:07,272 --> 01:24:10,173
What do you want?

759
01:24:10,241 --> 01:24:14,610
- Nothing.
- Then why bring her back?

760
01:24:16,581 --> 01:24:18,572
Just to be with her.

761
01:24:21,352 --> 01:24:23,286
To be with her.

762
01:24:33,097 --> 01:24:35,031
- Everything is ready?
- Yes, sir.

763
01:24:35,099 --> 01:24:38,296
- We're trying to assess how he might escape.
- He will not escape.

764
01:24:38,369 --> 01:24:40,929
- I want guards at every door and window!
- Sir.

765
01:24:48,613 --> 01:24:51,283
<i>I want to apologize to you
for my behavior of late.</i>

766
01:24:51,416 --> 01:24:54,317
But I want to make it up to you,
if you'll listen to a proposition.

767
01:24:54,386 --> 01:24:57,651
- Well, I don't know.
- I'll make it worth your while, Josef.

768
01:24:57,722 --> 01:25:01,021
You know, I'm very busy right now. I haven't
just been sitting around waiting for you.

769
01:25:01,092 --> 01:25:03,083
No. No, of course.

770
01:25:07,532 --> 01:25:11,059
I want you to assume control
of all my finances.

771
01:25:11,136 --> 01:25:13,570
And my assets.

772
01:25:13,638 --> 01:25:16,266
- Everything.
- Everything?

773
01:25:16,341 --> 01:25:19,504
Yes. Including this theater...

774
01:25:19,577 --> 01:25:21,511
and all the receipts from
tonight's performance...

775
01:25:21,579 --> 01:25:24,514
which I offer with
my sincere thanks.

776
01:25:28,019 --> 01:25:32,388
- What do you say?
- All right.

777
01:25:32,457 --> 01:25:35,483
- I'll do it.
- Good. Good.

778
01:25:36,661 --> 01:25:39,789
Would you like me
to introduce you tonight?

779
01:25:39,864 --> 01:25:42,697
No. Tonight, just enjoy the show.

780
01:26:05,156 --> 01:26:08,455
Excuse me, Chief Inspector.
I'm Josef Fischer, Eisenheim's manager.

781
01:26:08,526 --> 01:26:10,892
Yes, I remember.

782
01:26:10,962 --> 01:26:13,829
- What's going on? Why all the police?
- Precautions, Herr Fischer.

783
01:26:13,898 --> 01:26:16,594
- Precautions.
- Are you planning to arrest Eisenheim?

784
01:26:16,668 --> 01:26:19,603
Oh, that's entirely up to him.

785
01:26:58,309 --> 01:27:01,278
<i>There! There!</i>

786
01:27:03,415 --> 01:27:05,406
<i>It's Duchess von Teschen!</i>

787
01:27:17,829 --> 01:27:21,265
Why were you murdered?

788
01:27:21,332 --> 01:27:23,857
<i>- I was leaving him.
- Leaving who?</i>

789
01:27:23,935 --> 01:27:26,802
<i>- The crown prince?
- Of course it was.</i>

790
01:27:26,871 --> 01:27:29,669
<i>- We won't stand for it!
- I tried to get away.</i>

791
01:27:34,512 --> 01:27:36,537
I was wearing my locket when I died.

792
01:27:36,614 --> 01:27:39,742
<i>But now it's gone.
It's lost.</i>

793
01:27:39,818 --> 01:27:42,651
<i>- Tell us, please. Who murdered you?
- Was it the crown prince?</i>

794
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:45,188
We must do something!

795
01:27:45,256 --> 01:27:47,724
<i>- Come along.
- We must help her!</i>

796
01:27:53,264 --> 01:27:55,255
<i>To the front!</i>

797
01:27:56,601 --> 01:27:58,865
<i>Step out!</i>

798
01:28:02,006 --> 01:28:04,839
<i>In the name of
His Imperial Majesty...</i>

799
01:28:04,909 --> 01:28:10,176
and the City of Vienna,
I hereby arrest Eduard Abramovicz-

800
01:28:10,248 --> 01:28:13,149
also known as
Eisenheim the Illusionist-

801
01:28:13,218 --> 01:28:16,585
<i>on charges of
disturbing public order...</i>

802
01:28:16,654 --> 01:28:19,919
charlatanism and
threats against the empire!

803
01:28:19,991 --> 01:28:22,824
<i>- No!
- Get back, get back!</i>

804
01:28:26,498 --> 01:28:29,865
<i>Stop it! Stop it, all of you!</i>

805
01:29:25,690 --> 01:29:27,715
- He disappeared.
- Where is he?

806
01:29:31,195 --> 01:29:33,425
Find him!

807
01:29:43,508 --> 01:29:46,033
- Where is he?
- He was right there.

808
01:29:46,110 --> 01:29:48,305
- How was his trick done?
- No trick.

809
01:29:48,379 --> 01:29:50,847
- How is it done?
- I don't know. Nobody know.

810
01:29:58,623 --> 01:30:00,989
<i>Damn it!</i>

811
01:33:47,218 --> 01:33:50,915
<i>I had my driver take
the sword to police headquarters.</i>

812
01:33:53,524 --> 01:33:56,721
<i>My men will examine it and see
if it matches the gemstone...</i>

813
01:33:56,794 --> 01:33:59,763
<i>found on Duchess von Teschen's body-
I have no doubt that it will.</i>

814
01:34:03,935 --> 01:34:07,427
And after that, I came in here...

815
01:34:07,505 --> 01:34:10,702
and you asked me why I was late.

816
01:34:11,776 --> 01:34:13,744
You've stolen Imperial property.

817
01:34:13,811 --> 01:34:16,041
That seems trivial
compared with murder.

818
01:34:16,113 --> 01:34:18,513
Even if that were true, you have
no jurisdiction here.

819
01:34:18,583 --> 01:34:23,020
<i>That's right. You may do as you wish here,
without consequence.</i>

820
01:34:24,222 --> 01:34:27,953
Nobody can punish you.

821
01:34:28,025 --> 01:34:30,118
- Except one man.
- Who's that?

822
01:34:30,194 --> 01:34:33,061
The emperor.

823
01:34:33,130 --> 01:34:36,099
I don't suppose he'll leave his crown
to a murderer, do you?

824
01:34:39,237 --> 01:34:42,570
- He'll never believe you.
- Maybe not.

825
01:34:43,875 --> 01:34:46,673
Hmm.

826
01:34:46,744 --> 01:34:48,871
But, I wrote a letter
to his general staff...

827
01:34:48,946 --> 01:34:52,313
<i>telling them... everything.</i>

828
01:34:52,383 --> 01:34:55,648
<i>Including your plan
to overthrow the emperor.</i>

829
01:34:55,720 --> 01:34:58,917
I know they'll listen to that.

830
01:34:58,990 --> 01:35:01,584
<i>You'll not take the throne-
not with my help.</i>

831
01:35:01,659 --> 01:35:06,153
You no longer want to be chief of police?
Mayor of Vienna?

832
01:35:06,230 --> 01:35:09,859
<i>You don't want to be
a baron, an aristocrat?</i>

833
01:35:11,168 --> 01:35:13,932
I'm afraid that's out of
the question at this point.

834
01:35:19,377 --> 01:35:21,311
You fool.
He's tricking you.

835
01:35:21,379 --> 01:35:24,871
He's manipulating you. He had the sword
at a command performance.

836
01:35:24,949 --> 01:35:27,440
He could have pried the stones loose then
and planted them here.

837
01:35:27,518 --> 01:35:29,452
- He has planted everything.
- You're drunk.

838
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:34,184
It's all a trick.
It's an illusion.

839
01:35:35,660 --> 01:35:38,925
Perhaps there's truth
in this illusion.

840
01:35:52,009 --> 01:35:54,307
You need to wire your driver,
and have the sword returned.

841
01:35:54,378 --> 01:35:58,212
- Or what?
- I'll shoot you. Perhaps I'll shoot you anyway.

842
01:35:58,282 --> 01:36:01,774
And then you'll have killed
a police inspector and a duchess.

843
01:36:01,852 --> 01:36:03,786
Or perhaps you'll kill yourself.

844
01:36:03,854 --> 01:36:07,517
You, uh, committed suicide,
distraught at having failed your leader.

845
01:36:23,641 --> 01:36:29,136
<i>Ah. Some officers
of the general staff, I'd guess.</i>

846
01:36:29,213 --> 01:36:31,204
They must have received my letter.

847
01:36:40,491 --> 01:36:44,257
- What do you want?
- I don't want anything.

848
01:36:44,328 --> 01:36:49,061
Fine. Fine. You shall have nothing.

849
01:36:57,241 --> 01:37:01,143
- Gentlemen-
- The situation is so obvious.

850
01:37:01,212 --> 01:37:04,181
Everyone's completely incompetent.

851
01:37:04,248 --> 01:37:06,682
My father runs the empire
into the ground...

852
01:37:06,751 --> 01:37:08,810
and no one notices, no one
knows anything about it.

853
01:37:08,886 --> 01:37:11,218
I propose to clean up
the mess, and you betray me!

854
01:37:11,288 --> 01:37:13,916
You're all becoming irrelevant.
You will be replaced.

855
01:37:13,991 --> 01:37:18,325
The country will be run by mongrels!

856
01:37:18,396 --> 01:37:22,355
There's a thousand different voices screaming
to be heard, and nothing will be done!

857
01:37:22,433 --> 01:37:26,392
Nothing!
I've done everything I can.

858
01:37:26,470 --> 01:37:29,439
Too much!

859
01:37:31,642 --> 01:37:33,633
<i>Far too much.</i>

860
01:37:33,711 --> 01:37:36,942
<i>Your Highness!
Are you in there?</i>

861
01:37:37,014 --> 01:37:39,574
<i>Your Highness, open the door.</i>

862
01:37:39,650 --> 01:37:41,641
<i>Please. Open the door.</i>

863
01:37:41,719 --> 01:37:44,586
<i>By your father's authority...</i>

864
01:37:44,655 --> 01:37:47,647
<i>I insist you open the door!</i>

865
01:37:47,725 --> 01:37:49,852
<i>You must open the door!</i>

866
01:37:49,927 --> 01:37:52,589
You're all fools.

867
01:37:52,663 --> 01:37:55,962
<i>- Please, Your Highness!
- I can't stand it.</i>

868
01:37:56,033 --> 01:37:59,935
<i>I won't stand it.</i>

869
01:38:00,004 --> 01:38:02,495
<i>Break down the door. Break it down!</i>

870
01:38:07,378 --> 01:38:11,178
- What happened?
- The crown prince just shot himself.

871
01:38:57,128 --> 01:38:59,494
<i>Are you Chief Inspector Uhl?</i>

872
01:38:59,563 --> 01:39:01,963
I used to be.

873
01:39:26,557 --> 01:39:29,924
You!
Who gave you this?

874
01:39:32,163 --> 01:39:34,893
<i>- Who gave you this?
- Herr Eisenheim!</i>

875
01:39:35,966 --> 01:39:37,957
When?

876
01:39:59,823 --> 01:40:01,814
<i>Look out!</i>

877
01:41:05,489 --> 01:41:07,423
<i>All aboard!</i>

878
01:41:07,491 --> 01:41:10,016
Tickets and papers.

879
01:41:12,429 --> 01:41:15,523
<i>All aboard!</i>

880
01:41:43,794 --> 01:41:45,728
<i>When it's done...</i>

881
01:41:45,796 --> 01:41:48,162
you'll travel ahead
with her, and I will follow.

882
01:41:48,231 --> 01:41:51,632
<i>- And she understands everything this entails?
- Completely.</i>

883
01:41:51,702 --> 01:41:54,227
<i>Do you think that
Eisenheim's behind all this?</i>

884
01:41:57,774 --> 01:42:01,676
<i>So, what does it mean, to die?</i>

885
01:42:04,114 --> 01:42:08,073
<i>- What do you want?
- To be with her.</i>

886
01:42:08,151 --> 01:42:11,177
<i>To be with her.</i>

887
01:42:13,890 --> 01:42:18,884
<i>Chief Inspector,
there's one thing you should know.</i>

888
01:42:22,099 --> 01:42:24,829
<i>Your sword
is very beautiful. Might I see it?</i>

889
01:42:24,901 --> 01:42:27,267
<i>- You're drunk.
- You were drunk.</i>

890
01:42:41,752 --> 01:42:44,084
<i>He's a charlatan. He's a faker.</i>

891
01:42:44,154 --> 01:42:46,714
<i>He's planted everything.</i>

892
01:42:57,768 --> 01:43:00,362
<i>Everything
you have seen is an illusion.</i>

893
01:43:00,437 --> 01:43:02,769
<i>It's a trick.</i>
