1
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:45,423
<i>Yes, ma'am, how ya doin'?</i>

2
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,796
<i>Is this Rose Hill?</i>

3
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:50,427
<i>Good.
This is Ed Couch.</i>

4
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,937
<i>I'm Vesta Adcock's nephew.</i>

5
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,236
<i>I need to get up there
and see her,</i>

6
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:59,301
<i>but I'm gonna be late
'cause I'm lost out here.</i>

7
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,847
<i>We're off the Alabama interstate
but I don't know where.</i>

8
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:42,186
Did you hear that?
What?

9
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:44,314
The train.

10
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,257
No, I didn't hear
no train.

11
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:51,360
Oh, nothin',
I guess.

12
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:55,834
Where's "Whistle Stop" on
the map? I can't find it.

13
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:59,770
Why did you tell me to
turn right 10 miles back there?

14
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:04,834
God, you got a negative
sense of direction, hon.

15
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,778
I'm sorry.

16
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:12,045
Oh, Ed, your aunt's gonna be
so disappointed we're late.

17
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:16,111
I know she's been looking forward
to this visit all week long.

18
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:19,454
Bless her sweet,
little ol' heart.

19
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,463
Hey, how's my sweet Auntie V
this afternoon?

20
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:29,126
Remember us?

21
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:32,262
<i>Don't you look pretty!
We brought you something.</i>

22
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:35,501
<i>Let me look at
you.</i>

23
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:38,169
<i>Don't you know Evelyn loves you?</i>

24
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:43,079
Well, honey, I guess it'd be
better if you wait out here for me.

25
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:47,609
I'll get all this stuff.
Well, if you think it's best.

26
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:50,986
Yeah, I do this time.
Okay?

27
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:53,218
Have a nice day,
Aunt Vesta.

28
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,227
<i>Don't you pitch a fit like that!</i>

29
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:09,902
Did you know
they took my gallbladder out?

30
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:13,471
No, I didn't.

31
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:17,209
<i>Oh, yes. Still
in the hospital in a jar.</i>

32
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:22,084
I guess that's where
they keep 'em.

33
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,123
I guess.

34
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,420
When I was
in the hospital,

35
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:30,451
the nurse gave me one of them
Fleet enemas they're so fond of.

36
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,124
Mrs. Cleo Threadgoode,

37
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,498
82 year old widow,
imagine that.

38
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:39,697
Actually,
everybody calls me Ninny.

39
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:42,002
'Course I'm
just visitin' here.

40
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:47,342
Did you ever have
one of them Fleet enemas?

41
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:49,347
Um, well?

42
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:51,474
No.

43
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:54,782
You'd remember it.

44
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:58,517
Me and my friend, Mrs. Otis,
come from Whistle Stop.

45
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:00,786
You ever been
to Whistle Stop?

46
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,261
Why, yes. I just
passed by there today.

47
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:09,199
<i>She's lived down the street
from me for 30 years or more.</i>

48
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:11,259
After her son died,

49
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:14,932
her daughter-in-law had a fit for
her to come live at the nursing home.

50
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:18,306
They asked me to come
and be her roommate.

51
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:22,610
<i>Mrs. Otis don't know it, but I'm going
home just soon as she gets settled in good.</i>

52
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:28,352
Does the name "Idgie
Threadgoode" ring a bell?

53
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:31,948
Um, no, ma'am.
I don't think so.

54
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:34,822
You'd remember her.

55
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:38,796
You see, I was practically
adopted by the Threadgoode family.

56
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:41,197
I married her brother,
Cleo. Oh, uh-huh.

57
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:46,034
<i>Idgie and her friend, Ruth,
ran the Whistle Stop Cafe.</i>

58
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:48,039
<i>Oh.</i>

59
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:50,803
Idgie was a character,
all right.

60
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:54,210
<i>But how anybody
could've thought...</i>

61
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:58,307
<i>she murdered that man
is beyond me.</i>

62
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:00,352
I beg your pardon?

63
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,981
You sit and relax a while.
I'll tell you all about it.

64
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:06,684
Oh, now, let's see.

65
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:10,217
I 'member the day they pulled
that truck up out of the river.

66
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:14,255
<i>That same rainy, summer day...</i>

67
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:19,270
<i>Idgie Threadgoode was arrested for
the murder of the owner of that truck,</i>

68
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:22,307
<i>Frank Bennett.</i>

69
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,044
I guess,
to understand Idgie,

70
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:30,810
you'd have to start way back
with her brother, Buddy.

71
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:35,820
<i>Idgie was Buddy's pet
from the day she was born.</i>

72
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:41,990
<i>I 'member the day we was all
gettin'ready for Leona's weddin'.</i>

73
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:44,029
<i>The war had just ended,</i>

74
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:46,428
<i>the Great one,
you know.</i>

75
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:51,163
<i>And another one was about to
begin in the Threadgoode house.</i>

76
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:53,671
<i>Sipsey, honey, is that finished?</i>

77
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:58,176
<i>Buddy, get dressed, honey. Mama?</i>

78
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,212
Leona, what is it?

79
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:02,144
Idgie's upstairs
in her room...

80
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:04,183
and says she won't come out
as long as she lives.

81
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,377
She is gonna ruin my weddin'! Shh.

82
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:09,250
Leona, you're gonna be
the most beautiful bride.

83
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,587
Of course she is, Papa.

84
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:16,594
Your papa has spent every last
nickel he has just to make you happy.

85
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:20,462
Now, you try to act
a little grateful, young lady.

86
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:23,627
Imogene Louise Threadgoode!

87
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:26,228
This is your mama!

88
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:33,578
You come down here right now.
Do you hear me?

89
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:36,274
Buddy, fetch her. She'll listen
to you. Come on down, little bit.

90
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,909
<i>There's no firin'
squad waitin' for you.</i>

91
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:44,321
<i>Ohh! Come on,
honey. Let us see you.</i>

92
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,551
<i>You look so pretty.</i>

93
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:49,459
<i>I see London, I see... Hush!</i>

94
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,633
Julian, hush.

95
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,430
<i>Come ahead, sweetheart.</i>

96
00:08:57,503 --> 00:09:01,234
<i>You look awful nice in that.</i>

97
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:02,899
Mama!
You look fine.

98
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,466
<i>She looks like a monkey.</i>

99
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,342
<i>Julian, stop it
right this second!</i>

100
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:10,746
<i>Take it back!
Take it back! Idgie, hey!</i>

101
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:13,910
I told you she
was gonna ruin my weddin'!

102
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:16,352
<i>Idgie, get up.
Take it back!</i>

103
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:18,583
Take it back!

104
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:21,991
I'll get you for this.
No, Buddy.

105
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:28,858
<i>We have to be careful
when she's dressing up.</i>

106
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:30,869
<i>She's just a pain!</i>

107
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:34,464
<i>Leona, will you
stop shrieking!</i>

108
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,236
<i>This is your
weddin'day!</i>

109
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:51,087
<i>Looks like you got
yourself up a tree, little bit.</i>

110
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:54,183
I'm sick of
people makin' fun of me.

111
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,785
So you're gonna stay up here
all day long.

112
00:09:56,862 --> 00:10:00,059
Yep.
The hell with them.

113
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:04,068
Who wants to wear
that stupid ol' dress anyway?

114
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:07,503
<i>I ever tell you about
the oysters? Oysters?</i>

115
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:09,507
I tell you about the oysters? No.

116
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:14,239
<i>Think about the millions
of oysters lyin'around the ocean.</i>

117
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:16,645
Then one day...

118
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:19,514
God comes along and sees one
and he says,

119
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:22,486
"I think I'm gonna make
that one different."

120
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,750
You know what he does?

121
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:27,987
He puts a little
piece of sand in it.

122
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:32,292
Guess what it can do that
the others can't. What?

123
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:35,664
It can make
a beautiful pearl.

124
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,896
What if God
made a mistake?

125
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:43,067
Well, the way I figure it,
he never makes mistakes.

126
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,906
I mean, he made sure
we got together.

127
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,969
He made sure you got
the best looking,

128
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:50,242
most charmin' brother
in the world...

129
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,683
who's gonna beat you to the
chocolate cake. You will not.

130
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:56,119
Got you out of the tree,
didn't I?

131
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:59,123
Did not!

132
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:02,820
<i>Into this estate,
these two come now to be joined.</i>

133
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:04,988
<i>If any man present
can show cause...</i>

134
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:07,464
<i>why they may not lawfully
be joined together,</i>

135
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:12,664
let him speak now or
forever after hold his peace.

136
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:15,400
Please be seated.

137
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,972
If either of you
know any reason...

138
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:23,015
<i>why you may not justly be joined
together in holy matrimony,</i>

139
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:25,550
do you now confess it?

140
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,890
It is then your will
to proceed.

141
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:41,660
<i>Do you,
Charles Osgood Justice...</i>

142
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:50,839
<i>Thank you. I don't know what
we'd do without your generosity.</i>

143
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,879
Sipsey, especially you.
Look what you've done!

144
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:57,882
Thank you, Mrs.
Threadgoode. Gimme that, you rascal!

145
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,781
Ohh!
Jump on my back.

146
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:08,486
<i>I don't think there ever was
a sweeter boy than Buddy Threadgoode.</i>

147
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:13,055
You look beautiful, Lily.
Yes, Lily, you sure do.

148
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:16,568
<i>I had the biggest crush on him.</i>

149
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:18,967
<i>He was a terrible flirt!</i>

150
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:22,269
<i>But his heart belonged
to Ruth Jamison.</i>

151
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:25,504
<i>She was the daughter of
a friend of his mama's...</i>

152
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,376
<i>who was visitin'
that summer.</i>

153
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:31,905
Ruth Jamison, you're just
the one I've been lookin' for.

154
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:35,078
Are you thirsty? Let's
go visit someplace else.

155
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:40,921
<i>A little nest
that's nestled</i>

156
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:44,326
Think that's a big lake, you should've
seen the one next to our house.

157
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:46,523
We used to swim in it
and fish.

158
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,261
I sure do miss it.
Sure do.

159
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:52,065
What happened to it?
Did it dry up?

160
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:54,072
No, worse than that.

161
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,199
Last fall,
a flock of ducks,

162
00:12:56,275 --> 00:13:00,541
<i>40 or 50 of'em, landed right
smack in the middle of it.</i>

163
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,478
This fluke thing
happened.

164
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:05,016
The temperature dropped so fast
that the whole lake froze...

165
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:07,075
in three seconds,
just like that!

166
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,451
Those poor little ducks.
Did it kill them?

167
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:12,719
No, they flew off
and took the lake with 'em.

168
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:16,159
To this very day, that lake
is somewhere over in Georgia.

169
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:19,664
Buddy Threadgoode.

170
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,976
Come a little closer.
I wanna give you something.

171
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:36,480
<i>Come here.</i>

172
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,582
Whoop!

173
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:46,648
<i>You'll see
a smiling face</i>

174
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:50,126
<i>Come back here, hat.
Where do you think you're goin'?</i>

175
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:54,298
Whoa!

176
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:57,460
I got it. Hold on, Ruth.
Hold on, little bit.

177
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:04,604
It's all right.
I got it.

178
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:10,476
Come here, you damn hat. Got it!

179
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:13,484
<i>Oh, I meant to do that.</i>

180
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:18,284
I... got it!

181
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,222
<i>Ta-da!</i>

182
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,552
All right.
Damn!

183
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,598
Come on.

184
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:38,108
Come on. Get out.
Get out.

185
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,111
Buddy!

186
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:43,410
<i>- Buddy!
- Buddy Threadgoode!</i>

187
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,745
<i>Come on, Buddy!</i>

188
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,548
Get out.

189
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:52,149
Get out of there.

190
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:57,292
<i>Buddy!</i>

191
00:14:57,363 --> 00:15:00,491
<i>- Come on, Buddy!
- Buddy!</i>

192
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,160
Buddy!

193
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:08,298
No-o-o!

194
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:12,208
<i>Buddy!</i>

195
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:15,679
<i>Buddy, no!
No!</i>

196
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,512
<i>No! Buddy!
No-o-o!</i>

197
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,610
No! Buddy!
Let me go!

198
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:26,888
- No!
- Buddy!

199
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,588
<i>You got to go back
to the house.</i>

200
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:33,154
<i>Come on.
We're gonna go home.</i>

201
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:36,065
- Buddy!
- You have to be strong.

202
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:39,036
It'll be okay.
Buddy!

203
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:42,039
"The Lord is my Shepherd,

204
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,302
<i>I shall not want. "</i>

205
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:47,368
<i>Oh, it like
to have killed us all.</i>

206
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:50,108
<i>But nary a one took it
as hard as Idgie,</i>

207
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:58,679
<i>everyone thought she'd die
right along with him.</i>

208
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:19,607
<i>Night after night,
she stayed by the river.</i>

209
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:23,842
<i>Big George was the only soul
she'd let near her,</i>

210
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:27,443
<i>and he watched over her
night and day.</i>

211
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,317
<i>You know,
a heart can be broken,</i>

212
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:33,449
<i>but it still keeps a-beatin'
Just the same.</i>

213
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:36,153
Miss Idgie, you'll have
to keep this blanket on...

214
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:39,129
or you'll catch your death
of cold, you hear me now?

215
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:43,601
That's so sad.

216
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,602
Ah.

217
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,668
Would you like
one of these?

218
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:55,737
Oh, thank ya,
honey.

219
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:57,679
<i>Evelyn?</i>

220
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,911
Honey,
we gotta get goin'.

221
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:02,385
The Braves' game's
fixin' to start...

222
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:04,081
and you're gonna miss
your... thing.

223
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:07,887
Excuse me.
That's my husband, Ed.

224
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,019
Hi, ma'am.
How you doin'?

225
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:13,531
Um,

226
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,658
I can't believe
Buddy died.

227
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:18,328
Neither could I.

228
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:21,805
Oh, well, I enjoyed
talkin' to you, honey.

229
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,865
What's your name?

230
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:27,002
Evelyn...
Evelyn Couch.

231
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:31,846
I've got to go. You come
back and see me, you hear?

232
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:35,819
Okay.
Bye-bye.

233
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:38,285
<i>First of all, I want you...</i>

234
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:40,951
<i>to truly
dedicate yourselves...</i>

235
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:45,053
<i>to finding little ways to
putting that magic, that spark...</i>

236
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,325
back into your marriage.

237
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:51,335
When we think of
romance and marriage,

238
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:55,430
<i>what is the first thought that
comes into your mind? Divorce!</i>

239
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:59,204
Remember when counselors used to tell
you to wrap yourself in cellophane...

240
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:01,473
to put a little charge
into your marriage?

241
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:04,345
Do we really pay
for these lectures?

242
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,112
<i>You can see,
it is truly up to you...</i>

243
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:10,678
<i>to put romance back
into your relationship.</i>

244
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:20,197
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

245
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:23,462
<i>Da-na-na
da-na-na-na</i>

246
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:28,598
<i>As I walk this land
of broken dreams</i>

247
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:33,111
<i>I have visions
of many things</i>

248
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:36,272
<i>Happiness
Hi, honey.</i>

249
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:38,316
<i>Is just an illusion</i>

250
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:40,351
Evelyn,
have you gone insane?

251
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:42,353
<i>My God,
people can see you!</i>

252
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:44,480
<i>What if I had been
the paperboy?</i>

253
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:46,319
Get in there!

254
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:49,189
<i>What are you
thinking about?</i>

255
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:53,328
<i>Evelyn?</i>

256
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:55,696
Evelyn!
Oh.

257
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:59,726
You know, what we really need
instead of this baloney...

258
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:03,866
is an assertiveness training
class for Southern women.

259
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:07,503
But that's a contradiction
in terms, isn't it?

260
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:10,810
Especially you, sweetheart.
You're livin' in the Dark Ages.

261
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:17,884
<i>The roots of love
grow all around</i>

262
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:22,791
<i>But the leaves
they come tumblin'down</i>

263
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:27,889
<i>Every day, heartaches
grow a little stronger</i>

264
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:32,960
<i>I can't stand this pain
much longer</i>

265
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:36,666
Hi, honey. I need one of those. Hi!

266
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:39,506
Mmm, you smell good too.

267
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:41,603
I need one of these.

268
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,615
Oh, this looks good! Uh-huh.

269
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,617
Yes, indeedy.

270
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:51,748
<i>Always movin'
but goin'nowhere</i>

271
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:55,725
<i>Indistinct]</i>

272
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:58,763
Ed.

273
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:02,626
<i>Why don't you come in
and sit down at the table...</i>

274
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:06,637
and have dinner with me? I'm
sorry. The game's almost over.

275
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,538
I just want to see a little bit
of it. Why you so dressed up?

276
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:12,099
Honey, don't get in the way.
Scoot over a bit.

277
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:17,806
Ed?

278
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,875
If I'd answered the door
wearing only cellophane,

279
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:24,252
would you still be
watching the baseball game?

280
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:28,054
No, honey. I'd probably be
checking you into a looney bin.

281
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:54,614
<i>Hi, sugar.</i>

282
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:56,620
<i>How's my dumplin'?
Trick or treat!</i>

283
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:58,622
<i>You're not gonna throw
them hissy-fits, are you?</i>

284
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,921
<i>Happy Halloween!
Oh, no. No, no, no!</i>

285
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:04,087
<i>You're meaner than a damn snake.</i>

286
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:06,153
I'm glad
you're feeling better.

287
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:09,462
<i>Get back in bed. Good thing
your eyesight's failing.</i>

288
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:22,239
Hey!
Mmm. Oh.

289
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:25,715
Hey. I was hopin' you'd be here.

290
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:29,845
My roommate, Mrs. Otis,
said I could visit her family,

291
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:31,855
but I said,
"Thank you kindly,

292
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:34,551
but I think I might have
my own visitor."

293
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,617
And here you are.

294
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:38,959
Well, sit down.
Thank you.

295
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:42,558
And doughnuts to boot!
You can't beat that.

296
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:45,467
Well, help yourself, Mrs.
Threadgoode. Thank you.

297
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:47,228
How's your friend?

298
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,297
Mrs. Otis?
Uh-huh.

299
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:52,309
Well, not so good.
Oh.

300
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:55,107
Looks like I won't be
gettin' home for quite a while,

301
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:58,616
and I sure miss it.

302
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:01,949
Funny what you miss
when you're away from home.

303
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,420
I miss
the smell of coffee...

304
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:07,287
and bacon fryin'.

305
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:11,853
Oh, what I wouldn't give for a
plate of fried green tomatoes...

306
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,626
like we used to have
at the cafe.

307
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,100
Ooh!

308
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:23,699
I never told you about the cafe, did I?

309
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:25,709
No, ma'am.

310
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:30,373
Oh, well...
now let me back up a bit.

311
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:35,682
<i>You see, Idgie never
quite got over losing Buddy.</i>

312
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:41,083
<i>She hardly
ever come home.</i>

313
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:44,026
<i>Only Big George
knew how to find her.</i>

314
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:48,829
<i>She just didn't seem to care
about anythin'anymore.</i>

315
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,834
<i>Then, one summer day,</i>

316
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:53,871
<i>her mama sent for her.</i>

317
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:55,873
<i>Like they say,</i>

318
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:59,433
<i>God never shuts one door
without opening another.</i>

319
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:03,140
<i>That was also the day Idgie
met Frank Bennett, Mama!</i>

320
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,945
<i>The man whose murder
got her arrested.</i>

321
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:10,044
Well, hello there, miss.
And who might you be?

322
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:13,614
Towanda to you.
Who are you?

323
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:17,924
Oh, Frank Bennett's
the name, Miss Towanda.

324
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:21,989
I must say you are lookin'
mighty fine today.

325
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,058
You a politician...

326
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:27,333
or does lying
just run in your family?

327
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:31,335
<i>Mama!</i>

328
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,275
Well, there you are!

329
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:36,337
<i>Well, it's about time,
Idgie.</i>

330
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:42,052
If you don't look like
the wild man of Borneo.

331
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,715
Here you go. Well, thank you.

332
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:48,123
Guess who's here?
Who?

333
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:50,855
Ruth. She's stayin'
with us this summer...

334
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:54,330
and will be in charge of all the young
people's activities at the church.

335
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:59,166
Is that why you wanted to see me?
We have so many things planned.

336
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:01,364
<i>Ruth?</i>

337
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,932
<i>You remember my youngest
child? Of course I do.</i>

338
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:06,944
Hi, Idgie.

339
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:11,004
Hi.

340
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:17,783
Maybe this isn't
such a good idea.

341
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:20,416
Oh, it's got to work.

342
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:23,984
<i>Somebody's got to help her. I can't.</i>

343
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:28,359
Are you sure you want
to go to this river club, Miss Ruth?

344
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:30,367
These ain't no
churchgoing folks.

345
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:33,666
<i>I'll do just
fine, George, thank you.</i>

346
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:36,172
Oh, excuse me.

347
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:39,540
Is Idgie Threadgoode here
by any chance?

348
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:42,409
Come on in, honey.
She's right down here.

349
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:45,917
Here? Okay.
Uh-huh.

350
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,612
I'll see you,
Grady Kilgore,

351
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:50,746
and I'll
raise you twenty.

352
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:53,382
You ain't got nothin'!

353
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:56,757
<i>Maybe I do and maybe I don't.</i>

354
00:24:56,828 --> 00:25:01,060
Put your money where
your mouth is, Mr. Sheriff.

355
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:07,731
Well, look what
the cat drug in!

356
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:11,674
I came to talk to you.

357
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:14,109
You're gonna have to wait.
I'm busy.

358
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,773
Come on, Grady, this is your
big chance. You in or out?

359
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,282
<i>I'll make you
a rich man.</i>

360
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,343
<i>You just bluffin'again as usual.</i>

361
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:25,412
I'm afraid you're gonna have to excuse
Idgie. She's goin' home for dinner.

362
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,651
Say good-bye, Idgie.
Where you goin'?

363
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:32,095
Where the hell you goin' with
my money? We're goin' home!

364
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:36,099
<i>- Who are you to boss me around?
- The one holdin' your money!</i>

365
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:38,101
Give it back.

366
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:40,296
Now, get in the car.

367
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:45,404
All right,
I'll get in the car.

368
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:47,968
You win!

369
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:51,015
Come on.

370
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:52,640
Sucker!

371
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,742
<i>I'll leave when I want!</i>

372
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:58,619
I don't know how you can break
your mother's heart like you do.

373
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,851
I'm not doin' anything
to my mother.

374
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:03,486
Oh, no? Why do you think
I'm here for the summer?

375
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:06,929
Your mother was so worried, she thought I
might be able to talk some sense into you.

376
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:09,330
<i>But you're too busy
being selfish!</i>

377
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:12,370
What are you
talkin' about?

378
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:16,134
You're not the only one
who lost Buddy.

379
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:18,300
We all miss him...

380
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:21,243
but turning your back on
your family is not gonna help.

381
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:25,674
What's he got to do
with anything?

382
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:29,880
<i>Looks like you're the one with
the problem forgetting my brother.</i>

383
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,750
<i>Why, just ten miles away...</i>

384
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:38,728
<i>down by the river,</i>

385
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:41,027
<i>there lurks
a den of the devil...</i>

386
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:44,933
<i>where liquor
and gamblin'...</i>

387
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:47,836
<i>and sin abide!</i>

388
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:51,569
Snakes and serpents...

389
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:53,804
<i>Hey, Scroggins!</i>

390
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:57,837
You're finally preachin' about
somethin' you're kin to... snakes!

391
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:01,215
<i>As I said,</i>

392
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:06,417
snakes and serpents
take many disguises.

393
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:09,756
<i>Let's turn to page 53
in our hymnal.</i>

394
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:18,859
Yoo-hoo!

395
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:23,738
Big George thought
I might find you here.

396
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:31,446
If you give me a chance,
a chance to get to know you,

397
00:27:31,516 --> 00:27:35,247
maybe it'll be fun!

398
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,721
Fun?

399
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:42,055
Idgie, just spend
some time with me.

400
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:44,061
Please?

401
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:46,063
Suit yourself.

402
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:49,427
<i>You sure you
don't wanna back out?</i>

403
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:52,698
It's not too late.
I'm sure.

404
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:55,103
Here, hold this.

405
00:27:57,108 --> 00:27:59,804
Tell me now,
you like trains?

406
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:03,678
Yes.
Good.

407
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:07,650
We'll get along
just fine!

408
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:12,646
Boy, did we
luck out tonight.

409
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,757
Hop in.

410
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:20,354
Hop?

411
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:23,458
Oh. Give me
your hand.

412
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:26,003
Put your foot
up there.

413
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:37,440
Hold that.

414
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:41,147
Ooo-ooo!
Look at all this!

415
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:49,318
Don't you think we should get off
the train? It's startin' to move.

416
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:53,194
No. The fun
just started!

417
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:58,934
You all right?

418
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:03,235
Well, sometimes I get
a little dizzy lookin' down.

419
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:06,004
Don't look down.

420
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:22,656
What are you doin'?
Come on. Look.

421
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:25,628
<i>They're throwin'
away food!</i>

422
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:32,095
You talk about
"give unto others."

423
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:35,230
Yes, but this food
isn't yours to give.

424
00:29:35,306 --> 00:29:37,467
That's church talk.

425
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:40,534
I've seen those same people
over at church on Sunday...

426
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:43,240
over at the river club every
other night of the week,

427
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:47,182
doin' anything
but pray. Come on.

428
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:04,728
<i>More!
Give me some.</i>

429
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:33,428
Okay, time to get off.

430
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:36,033
We gotta jump.

431
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,694
Jump?

432
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:41,830
<i>Yeah, jump. The next stop's
five miles down the tracks.</i>

433
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:43,897
I don't wanna walk
that far back.

434
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:46,842
Are you crazy?

435
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:49,277
<i>You're not kiddin'.</i>

436
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:53,010
Well...

437
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:55,552
I give up. Jump.

438
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,885
I'll tell Mama I'm not
a good influence on you...

439
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:01,221
You'll never jump,
will you?

440
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:06,389
Don't say "never"
to me.

441
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:21,207
Towanda!

442
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:36,686
<i>You all right?
I'm fine.</i>

443
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:40,322
<i>I'm all right.</i>

444
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:42,525
Ow!

445
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,932
Does this hurt?

446
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:47,767
Guess so.

447
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:50,137
We better get you to
a doc... doctor. Shit!

448
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:52,301
Which way is it?

449
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:55,972
About two miles
down the tracks.

450
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:58,277
All right,
let's go.

451
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:03,576
You'll never be able
to carry me that far.

452
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:06,351
I know.
Never say never.

453
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:10,554
I'm not carryin' you.
You're walkin'.

454
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:21,234
<i>Thank you,
Julian. I owe you one.</i>

455
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:35,085
Uh. Ow.

456
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:38,714
Aren't you ready yet?

457
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,883
What?

458
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:46,021
This doesn't have anything
to do with trains, does it?

459
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:49,161
You like honey?

460
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:51,201
Yeah, I like honey.

461
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:53,260
Fresh honey?
Yeah.

462
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:56,865
Me too.
There it is.

463
00:32:56,941 --> 00:33:01,139
There what... is?

464
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:05,080
<i>You'll see soon enough.</i>

465
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:11,283
Now... stay here.

466
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:14,291
No matter what happens,
don't move.

467
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:17,624
What are you
gonna do?

468
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:54,723
Ah.

469
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:32,928
<i>Here you are, madam.
This is for you.</i>

470
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:37,373
Why did you do that?
You could have been killed.

471
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:40,934
I'm sorry.

472
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:43,708
Don't you want
the honey?

473
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:47,114
I got it
just for you.

474
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:49,653
It's all right.
I do it all the time.

475
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:53,486
I never get stung,
honest.

476
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:55,549
Don't be
mad at me, Ruth.

477
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:59,528
Idgie,
I'm not mad at you.

478
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:02,157
No foolin'?

479
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:11,669
Is it bad,
what I did?

480
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:14,074
No.

481
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:16,306
I thought I might
be crazy or somethin'.

482
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,178
No, no.

483
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:22,913
I've heard there were people
who could charm bees.

484
00:35:22,987 --> 00:35:26,616
I've just never seen
it done... before today.

485
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:32,895
You're just a bee charmer,
Idgie Threadgoode.

486
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:37,424
That's what you are,
a bee charmer.

487
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:40,232
Here, you want
to taste it?

488
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:49,107
<i>"Satan started to
laugh at Jobs devotion.</i>

489
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:54,413
<i>"He bet God that Job would
never have so much faith...</i>

490
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,578
"if he didn't have
so many blessings.

491
00:35:56,654 --> 00:36:00,522
"He went on and on so long and
so much that God finally agreed...

492
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:03,287
"to let Satan
put Job to a test.

493
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:06,489
<i>"Suddenly, from bein'
on top of the world,</i>

494
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:10,193
<i>Job was plunged down into
the deepest pits of misery. "</i>

495
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:14,966
Surprise!

496
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:19,175
Idgie Threadgoode!

497
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:21,177
Tonight we're gonna have
a real party.

498
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:23,475
Drink this... and then,
we're gonna play some poker.

499
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:27,416
I don't know how to play
poker and I never drink...

500
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:29,476
but thank you anyway.

501
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:34,548
<i>Oh,
my darlin' Oh, my darlin'</i>

502
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:37,116
<i>Here comes the windup.</i>

503
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,527
Burn that ball in here.
Burn 'em in here!

504
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:43,966
Right in the pocket. I
don't know how to bat.

505
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,833
And you don't drink,
either.

506
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:49,998
<i>It's gonna be a spitter.
Hold the bat and swing.</i>

507
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:51,803
Spitter?

508
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:55,073
<i>- She gonna spit at me?
- She's gonna spit on the ball.</i>

509
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:58,343
Swing that bat!
Take another crack at it.

510
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:00,577
I'm gonna take
another crack at it.

511
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:03,848
<i>Get 'em in here.</i>

512
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:14,160
Now run, Ruth.
Run!

513
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,223
Come on
around the bases!

514
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,291
Don't kiss everybody.
Run!

515
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:21,395
I have never had
so much fun...

516
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:23,804
in my whole life.

517
00:37:23,874 --> 00:37:27,173
I even got a home run.

518
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:30,214
A clean one
at that!

519
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:33,478
A straight beats
three of a kind.

520
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:42,821
You know,
poker isn't half bad.

521
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:45,054
What's your mother
gonna say...

522
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:48,496
when she sees us both...
drunk?

523
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:52,468
You gotta stop worrying about
what people think. I know.

524
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:54,527
You've always done
the right thing.

525
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:58,041
You took care of your daddy,
the preacher, when he took sick.

526
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:01,977
You take care of all the kids
over at the church school.

527
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:04,776
You're gonna
take care of your mama.

528
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:08,376
And I'm gonna marry
the man I'm supposed to.

529
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,716
You gettin' married?

530
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:15,054
As soon as
the summer's over.

531
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:22,293
Oh, am I
gonna miss you.

532
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:25,494
This is
the best birthday...

533
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:28,538
I ever had.

534
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:44,680
<i>Ruth invited
Idgie to the weddin',</i>

535
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:47,349
<i>but Idgie never did
write back.</i>

536
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:51,828
<i>No, but she did drive all night
to Valdosta, Georgia,</i>

537
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:53,830
<i>to watch from afar.</i>

538
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:56,867
Oh, here we go!

539
00:38:56,934 --> 00:39:00,426
<i>And she swore
she'd never see Ruth again.</i>

540
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:03,735
<i>No sir! Whew!</i>

541
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:08,074
Now, Mama Jamison,
you put that down.

542
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:10,739
Oh, my Lord!

543
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:19,381
<i>During these next few weeks,</i>

544
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:23,791
<i>we will be learning to reclaim
our own power as women!</i>

545
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,954
Hallelujah!

546
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:30,797
And tonight, we're gonna
begin to explore...

547
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:33,063
<i>our own femaleness...</i>

548
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:37,699
<i>by examining the source
of our strength...</i>

549
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:40,141
and our separateness.

550
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,179
Our vaginas.

551
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:46,946
<i>So if y'all will just
slip off your panties...</i>

552
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:50,544
and straddle your mirrors.

553
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:53,283
<i>Ms. Couch!</i>

554
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:56,793
Ms. Couch!

555
00:39:56,861 --> 00:40:01,230
Um, I need to be excused
for a minute.

556
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:05,359
Um, Missy, could you come
with me to the ladies' room?

557
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:09,167
- Do you find this threatening?
- Uh, well, um...

558
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:13,370
<i>do you have a problem with
your sexuality? No, ma'am.</i>

559
00:40:13,444 --> 00:40:16,470
But I do have a problem
with my girdle.

560
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:34,823
<i>Cherish is the word
I use to describe</i>

561
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:41,170
<i>Hi, baby. All the
feelings that I have...</i>

562
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:44,799
All right, fried chicken!
My favorite.

563
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:50,613
<i>I don't know how many times
I wish that I had told you</i>

564
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:52,808
Ed?

565
00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:55,943
<i>Ed?</i>

566
00:40:56,020 --> 00:41:00,514
Those classes I've been taking
aren't helpin' us one bit.

567
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:03,253
Let's go to Florida...

568
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:05,659
like when
we got married.

569
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:09,062
Kyle's gone,
busy with his own life.

570
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:11,124
It'd be
just the two of us.

571
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:14,137
Well, honey, it's just
the two of us here now.

572
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:16,901
Boy, you got a good scald
on that chicken!

573
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:19,966
I'm tellin' you, that's
really good. Thank you.

574
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:21,978
We could rent a boat...

575
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:25,709
and drift around
in the hot sun.

576
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:27,876
What do you
think about it?

577
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:30,944
I'm just gettin' used to it
being quiet around here.

578
00:41:31,021 --> 00:41:34,787
Honey, if those classes
aren't doin' you any good,

579
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:37,828
then don't go to 'em.

580
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:40,489
<i>Everyone needs a
miracle in their life.</i>

581
00:41:40,564 --> 00:41:44,694
Damn, game's
blacked out!

582
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:55,204
Yoo-hoo,
Mrs. Threadgoode?

583
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:58,680
Hey, Evelyn!

584
00:41:58,749 --> 00:42:00,944
Do you like it?

585
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:04,385
Oooh! Well,

586
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:07,390
<i>who did it for ya,
darlin'? Believe it or not,</i>

587
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:09,392
it was a student,
a little bitty thing,

588
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:13,055
no bigger than a midget
from the beauty college.

589
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:16,463
Sometimes they come out here
and do our hair for free...

590
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:19,332
just for the practice,
you know.

591
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:23,931
Is Ed with ya?
No, ma'am.

592
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:27,739
His aunt said she didn't want
visitors anymore, especially us.

593
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:32,043
It's a shame.
I know he feels bad,

594
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:35,108
but Lord if he'll
talk to me about it.

595
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:42,287
Oh, thank you.

596
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:45,328
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

597
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:49,698
Mrs. Threadgoode...

598
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:56,906
How about tellin' me
some more... about Idgie?

599
00:42:56,974 --> 00:42:59,340
Oh, well, now,
let me see.

600
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:04,712
Where were we? Ruth had just
gotten married to Frank Bennett?

601
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:07,114
Wasn't that the man Idgie
was arrested for murderin'?

602
00:43:07,184 --> 00:43:10,381
That's right.

603
00:43:10,454 --> 00:43:16,017
After Ruth left, Idgie
went back to her old ways,

604
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:20,621
<i>Hangin'out with Grady
and the boys at the river club.</i>

605
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:26,568
<i>But after a few years,
temptation got the better of her.</i>

606
00:43:29,473 --> 00:43:33,307
I don't wanna wake you, Miss Idgie,
but it's an all-day drive to Valdosta.

607
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:36,403
Your mama said if you're goin', she
wants you to take this pie to Miss Ruth.

608
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:41,417
How does she know where
I'm going? I told her.

609
00:43:41,485 --> 00:43:44,921
Don't you go stirrin' up
no trouble for Miss Ruth now.

610
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:47,287
Yes, ma'am.
Don't "yes, ma'am" me.

611
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:49,326
You can stay in my house
as long as you want,

612
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:52,089
but don't treat me
like you treat your mama.

613
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:54,562
Grandma!
Yes, ma'am.

614
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:23,693
Hi there.

615
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:27,663
Yes?
Uh, is Ruth at home?

616
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:29,858
Who's callin'?

617
00:44:29,933 --> 00:44:34,233
You just tell her it's the
bee charmer from Alabama.

618
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:37,273
Ruth,

619
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:41,141
there's some bee person
here to see you.

620
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:57,720
<i>Idgie.
Hi.</i>

621
00:44:57,795 --> 00:45:01,390
You got a real nice home,
real nice things and all.

622
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:03,456
Mm-hmm,
thank you.

623
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:07,994
Mama said to give you
this pie.

624
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:10,836
So...

625
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:17,904
Idgie Threadgoode,
how are ya?

626
00:45:17,981 --> 00:45:22,577
You look so...
so grown up.

627
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:27,215
All the guys
must be wild about you.

628
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:31,057
Tell me,
do you have a fella yet?

629
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:35,565
A... couple.

630
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:37,998
I haven't decided
on any.

631
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:40,002
Grady's the most
persistent, but...

632
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:42,971
Grady Kilgore? Don't say it so loud.

633
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,702
<i>Ruth, honey, who's down there?</i>

634
00:45:46,844 --> 00:45:48,812
Hey...
Well...

635
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:51,347
What happened to you?
Nothin'.

636
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:53,542
Nothin'!
Where'd you get the shiner?

637
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:55,551
<i>Well, l... Who's down there?</i>

638
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:58,782
You'd better leave now. Did he hit you?

639
00:45:58,856 --> 00:46:02,553
Did he beat you? Somebody's
got to talk to him. Idgie.

640
00:46:02,626 --> 00:46:04,753
You're not gonna do
anything. I'm gonna kill him.

641
00:46:04,828 --> 00:46:06,887
I'm gonna have a
conversation with him about...

642
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:09,728
You're not gonna do anything.
...pickin' on somebody his own size.

643
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,268
You're not gonna do
anything, understand?

644
00:46:12,336 --> 00:46:14,531
If you care about me,
if you really do,

645
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:18,507
you'll turn around and leave
this minute. You understand?

646
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:35,185
Well, what'd
she want?

647
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:40,525
Nothin'.

648
00:46:50,374 --> 00:46:54,936
Ruth's a grown woman, and
she knows what's best for her.

649
00:46:55,012 --> 00:46:58,504
Mmm, I'm not so sure
about that.

650
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:01,041
<i>Idgie?</i>

651
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:03,416
Grady.
Hi.

652
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:07,116
Idgie, will you dance with me? No.

653
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:09,819
Come on.
It's only a dance.

654
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:16,724
Miss Idgie Threadgoode...
Get your butt off the floor.

655
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,031
Will you dance
with me?

656
00:47:22,272 --> 00:47:27,005
I will not dance with you,
and I will not marry you.

657
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:30,240
Go marry Gladys Moats.
She just adores you.

658
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:34,273
But she did fall on her
head when she was a child.

659
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:38,784
You're just a goofy girl,
Idgie, a goofy girl.

660
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:40,847
Who're you callin'
a goof? Ow-ow-ow!

661
00:47:40,924 --> 00:47:44,087
Who you callin' a goof? Stop
that before I get mad and hurt ya.

662
00:47:44,161 --> 00:47:46,322
Oh, yeah.
You try it.

663
00:47:46,396 --> 00:47:49,923
Grady! There now, you give up?

664
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,968
No, I'll never
give up!

665
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:56,563
<i>Grady finally
got dizzy and give up.</i>

666
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:01,270
<i>Try as they might, none of them
fellas could tame Idgie.</i>

667
00:48:01,979 --> 00:48:04,174
<i>Now,
a little while later,</i>

668
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:08,014
<i>a letter
come from Ruth.</i>

669
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:15,285
Oh,
it's an obituary.

670
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:18,795
Oh, no, honey,
Ruth's mother died.

671
00:48:18,862 --> 00:48:20,796
Oh.

672
00:48:20,864 --> 00:48:22,957
And this
is from the Bible.

673
00:48:23,033 --> 00:48:25,593
<i>It's from
the book of Ruth.</i>

674
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:30,902
"And Ruth said,
whither thou goest, I will go;

675
00:48:30,974 --> 00:48:33,306
"where thou lodgest,
I will lodge;

676
00:48:33,377 --> 00:48:37,074
thy people
shall be my people."

677
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:59,028
All right, Julian,
you and Big George wait here.

678
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:14,243
Mama died.
I know.

679
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:20,755
And I'm pregnant.

680
00:49:38,075 --> 00:49:41,670
<i>Julian, I got another
box here when you're done!</i>

681
00:49:52,422 --> 00:49:54,447
<i>I never seen
anybody with so many hats.</i>

682
00:49:54,524 --> 00:49:56,685
<i>Why don't we put
three in one box?</i>

683
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:59,695
<i>I don't think we can fit
all these in the car.</i>

684
00:49:59,763 --> 00:50:02,857
<i>We're gonna need a separate
truck for all your stuff.</i>

685
00:50:02,933 --> 00:50:04,867
<i>What the hell is going on here?</i>

686
00:50:04,935 --> 00:50:06,869
Looks like your wife's
leavin' you, mister.

687
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:11,772
<i>Sure she is. Don't
you touch her! Let go.</i>

688
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:15,437
You bastard!

689
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:17,446
<i>Put her down!</i>

690
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:19,744
Bastard!
Whoooo!

691
00:50:19,816 --> 00:50:21,943
<i>Stop it!</i>

692
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:26,416
Don't you hurt her!

693
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:29,391
<i>Frank!</i>

694
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:36,063
I wouldn't do that
if I was you, mister.

695
00:50:38,635 --> 00:50:42,435
See, the thing is,
you might upset Big George.

696
00:50:42,506 --> 00:50:44,906
<i>And he's crazy.</i>

697
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:49,071
<i>There's no tellin'
what he might do.</i>

698
00:51:09,866 --> 00:51:13,233
Go on,
get outta here.

699
00:51:23,346 --> 00:51:25,974
Hey!

700
00:51:26,049 --> 00:51:29,348
<i>Come on!
Hey, hey! Come on now!</i>

701
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:32,411
Let's go. Come on.
You okay?

702
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:35,083
<i>Let's get Miss
Ruth and get outta here.</i>

703
00:51:35,158 --> 00:51:38,855
<i>Come on, Miss Ruth.
Come on.</i>

704
00:51:40,397 --> 00:51:44,356
If you ever touch her again,
I'll kill you.

705
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:53,271
<i>Well, I sure as
hell scared him, didn't I?</i>

706
00:51:53,343 --> 00:51:55,971
<i>Yeah, you sure scared him.</i>

707
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:59,015
<i>Towanda, the
amazing Amazon woman!</i>

708
00:51:59,082 --> 00:52:01,073
<i>Towanda?</i>

709
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:03,949
<i>Towanda! Towanda!</i>

710
00:52:06,857 --> 00:52:09,792
<i>Evelyn?
Evelyn!</i>

711
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:12,021
Oh!
I'm sorry.

712
00:52:12,095 --> 00:52:14,154
I was just lookin'
at the pictures, Missy.

713
00:52:14,231 --> 00:52:17,564
They have the greatest stories
in that magazine, don't they?

714
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:20,000
Will I see you
in group tonight?

715
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:22,595
We'll be talking about
masturbation.

716
00:52:22,672 --> 00:52:26,768
No, I don't think so. I think I've
had enough learnin' for the time bein'.

717
00:52:26,843 --> 00:52:30,609
Thank you.
Thank you.

718
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:33,410
Oh!
Excuse me.

719
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:36,475
Screw you!

720
00:52:43,226 --> 00:52:45,251
Excuse me,
young man.

721
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:49,128
There was no reason for you
to be so rude to me.

722
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:51,759
Get away from me, you fat
cow. What did you call me?

723
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:54,326
Beat it,
you old bitch.

724
00:52:54,404 --> 00:52:57,373
Why are you being
so mean to me?

725
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,603
What did I ever
do to you...

726
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:04,135
I don't understand!

727
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:15,549
Look at my Stove Top!

728
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:24,865
Boo!

729
00:53:24,935 --> 00:53:29,531
Oh, honey, what in the world
is the matter?

730
00:53:29,606 --> 00:53:32,336
I don't know.

731
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:37,477
Come on.

732
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:40,539
Come on.
I need some exercise.

733
00:53:48,592 --> 00:53:54,462
Now, you tell me what's
botherin' you, sugar.

734
00:53:54,531 --> 00:53:59,093
I just...
I just feel so useless.

735
00:53:59,169 --> 00:54:03,003
So...
So powerless.

736
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:08,010
Everybody goes through that.
But I can't stop eatin'.

737
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:13,015
Every day I try and try
and every day I go off.

738
00:54:16,052 --> 00:54:19,078
I hide candy bars
all over the house.

739
00:54:19,155 --> 00:54:22,124
A candy bar ain't
gonna hurt ya none.

740
00:54:22,192 --> 00:54:26,526
One, no.
But 10 or 11?

741
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:31,298
I can't even look
at my own vagina.

742
00:54:31,368 --> 00:54:34,826
I can't help ya
on that one.

743
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:39,307
I wish I had the courage to get
it over with and get really fat.

744
00:54:43,246 --> 00:54:47,683
Oh, Mrs. Threadgoode,
I just...

745
00:54:47,751 --> 00:54:52,245
I'm too young to be old
and I'm too old to be young.

746
00:54:54,157 --> 00:54:56,990
Maybe I'm just
goin' crazy.

747
00:54:58,595 --> 00:55:01,792
You get hot flashes?

748
00:55:01,865 --> 00:55:03,799
Sometimes.

749
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:07,894
You get the sweats and your
hearts starts a-poundin'?

750
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:10,303
- How did you know?
- Simple, honey.

751
00:55:10,373 --> 00:55:14,070
You're going through
the change.

752
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:18,638
I used to burst
into tears for no reason at all.

753
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:22,615
You need some hormones. Hmm?

754
00:55:22,686 --> 00:55:26,281
Maybe some Stresstabs
number 4 for good measure.

755
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:29,814
- Really? Is that all?
- Sure, honey.

756
00:55:29,893 --> 00:55:32,225
You get yourself
some hormones.

757
00:55:32,295 --> 00:55:35,787
Then you get outta
the house and get a job.

758
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:39,601
With your
pretty complexion...

759
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:43,435
I'll bet you'll be
great with cosmetics.

760
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:48,402
I know how
you feel.

761
00:55:48,478 --> 00:55:51,914
I was about your age
when I had my child.

762
00:55:51,981 --> 00:55:54,472
Then I went through
the change of life.

763
00:55:54,551 --> 00:55:59,181
I didn't know you had
a child. Yes, I did.

764
00:55:59,255 --> 00:56:02,224
Albert.

765
00:56:02,292 --> 00:56:06,888
When he was born, the doctor said
it would be best if I didn't see him.

766
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:11,059
He said his mind would never
develop past the age of five,

767
00:56:11,134 --> 00:56:14,103
and I should just put him
in an institution...

768
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:18,834
because the burden of raisin' a
child like that would be too great.

769
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:24,878
Well, I thought
about Ruth.

770
00:56:26,449 --> 00:56:28,781
She always said...

771
00:56:28,852 --> 00:56:32,288
there was a separate
God for children.

772
00:56:32,355 --> 00:56:37,258
So I smiled at him and
I asked for the baby.

773
00:56:37,327 --> 00:56:42,026
Oh, how could anybody think
that sweet, precious baby...

774
00:56:42,098 --> 00:56:44,328
could ever
be a burden?

775
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:48,701
Why, from the minute he was born,
Albert was the joy of my life,

776
00:56:48,772 --> 00:56:51,798
the Lord's
greatest gift.

777
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:56,437
I don't believe there was a purer
soul ever lived on this earth.

778
00:56:56,513 --> 00:56:59,482
I had him with me
till he was 30.

779
00:56:59,549 --> 00:57:03,815
Then he went to sleep
and didn't wake up.

780
00:57:05,221 --> 00:57:07,951
Sometimes I can't wait to get
to heaven to see him again.

781
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:13,528
<i>Whoo!</i>

782
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:16,861
Shit!
It's a boy!

783
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:22,765
I think a prayer of
thanksgivin' would be in order.

784
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:26,832
Goddamn it to hell, son-of-a-bitch,
she did it! Here's to Ruth!

785
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:31,176
<i>Idgie always did have a
way with words around the reverend.</i>

786
00:57:31,881 --> 00:57:35,373
<i>Well, Ruth had a baby.</i>

787
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:38,182
<i>She named him Buddy...
Buddy Junior.</i>

788
00:57:38,254 --> 00:57:43,385
<i>Papa went out and borrowed money so
Ruth and Idgie could start a cafe,</i>

789
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,690
<i>the Whistle Stop Cafe.</i>

790
00:57:50,433 --> 00:57:55,700
<i>When you come by my house
come down behind the jail</i>

791
00:57:55,772 --> 00:57:58,366
<i>I've got a sign
on my door</i>

792
00:57:58,441 --> 00:58:00,705
<i>Barbecue for sale</i>

793
00:58:00,777 --> 00:58:03,541
<i>I'm talkin'
about barbecue</i>

794
00:58:03,613 --> 00:58:08,550
<i>Only thing I crave</i>

795
00:58:08,618 --> 00:58:11,678
<i>And a good-doin' meat</i>

796
00:58:11,754 --> 00:58:17,021
<i>Will carry me
to my grave</i>

797
00:58:17,093 --> 00:58:21,860
<i>I'm sellin' it for cheap
'cause I got good stuff</i>

798
00:58:21,931 --> 00:58:24,195
<i>Miss Idgie,
can you get the door?</i>

799
00:58:24,267 --> 00:58:27,862
Yes.
Big George.

800
00:58:27,937 --> 00:58:31,236
<i>Miss Ruth, me and the
missus want to thank you...</i>

801
00:58:31,307 --> 00:58:33,468
for sendin' that soup
over last night.

802
00:58:33,543 --> 00:58:37,775
I'll pay you when I get
ahead. You don't owe me, Ocie.

803
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:40,509
Thank you. I'm just glad they're better.

804
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:44,246
How is this, by the way?
It's good, very good.

805
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:47,778
<i>I'm not happy
till I see clean plates.</i>

806
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:52,985
Can't go on,
Idgie.

807
00:58:53,062 --> 00:58:55,360
I'm talking to you
as a friend.

808
00:58:55,431 --> 00:58:59,891
There's people in this town, paying
customers too... There you go.

809
00:58:59,969 --> 00:59:03,598
But some people
don't like you...

810
00:59:03,673 --> 00:59:05,834
<i>sellin' to coloreds.</i>

811
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:07,877
Here you go.

812
00:59:07,944 --> 00:59:11,846
Tell you what. Next time
those "some people" come here,

813
00:59:11,915 --> 00:59:14,349
I'm gonna ask if they
don't want anybody to know...

814
00:59:14,417 --> 00:59:16,578
who they are
under those sheets...

815
00:59:16,653 --> 00:59:20,749
when they go marchin'
in those stupid parades,

816
00:59:20,823 --> 00:59:23,656
how come they don't have
sense to change their shoes?

817
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:27,059
Hold on there.
Y'all ain't foolin' anybody.

818
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:31,328
I'd recognize those size 14
clodhoppers you got anywhere.

819
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:34,529
- Just a minute, Idgie.
- More pie, Grady?

820
00:59:34,604 --> 00:59:37,095
No, thank you, Ruth.

821
00:59:37,173 --> 00:59:40,734
Idgie, I'll talk
to the boys.

822
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:42,971
You just keep them
on out back there, ya hear?

823
00:59:43,046 --> 00:59:47,813
<i>Bye, Ruth.
Bye, Grady.</i>

824
00:59:48,518 --> 00:59:49,951
You're gonna get yourself
in a heap of trouble.

825
00:59:50,019 --> 00:59:54,012
What, Grady?
He's harmless.

826
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:58,117
You shoulda seen that
big ox down by the river.

827
00:59:58,194 --> 01:00:02,221
Three solid days, drunk as
a dog, cryin' like a baby...

828
01:00:02,298 --> 01:00:05,062
'cause Joe, that ol' colored
man that raised him, died.

829
01:00:05,134 --> 01:00:07,068
<i>Remember that, Sipsey? Yes'm.</i>

830
01:00:07,136 --> 01:00:09,832
<i>He sure ain't jokin' now,
is he, son? No, ma'am.</i>

831
01:00:09,906 --> 01:00:12,272
He won't even sit in the same
room and have a meal today.

832
01:00:12,342 --> 01:00:17,279
Don't make no sense. Big ox like Grady
won't sit next to a colored child,

833
01:00:17,347 --> 01:00:20,783
but he eats eggs... Shoot
right out of a chicken's ass.

834
01:00:30,259 --> 01:00:34,218
<i>Now some like it hot
some like it cold</i>

835
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:39,758
<i>Some take it any way
any way it's sold</i>

836
01:00:39,836 --> 01:00:42,600
<i>I'm talkin' about
barbecue</i>

837
01:00:42,672 --> 01:00:45,641
<i>All these things
I pray</i>

838
01:00:45,708 --> 01:00:48,370
Come on, Smokey,
let's go for a walk.

839
01:00:57,353 --> 01:01:00,117
I'm sorry about
spillin' my food, ma'am.

840
01:01:00,189 --> 01:01:03,852
I'll just
head on.

841
01:01:12,568 --> 01:01:15,594
See that piece
of land over there?

842
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:18,470
See it?
That used to be a lake.

843
01:01:18,541 --> 01:01:20,532
Yeah.

844
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:22,544
This one November,

845
01:01:22,612 --> 01:01:24,546
all these ducks
come by...

846
01:01:24,614 --> 01:01:27,879
<i>and they landed
on that lake.</i>

847
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:32,046
Then the temperature dropped so
fast, the whole lake just froze.

848
01:01:32,121 --> 01:01:35,147
Then the ducks took off
and took the lake with 'em.

849
01:01:35,224 --> 01:01:38,022
Now that lake's somewhere
in Georgia, the way I hear it.

850
01:01:38,094 --> 01:01:40,756
<i>Go on now.</i>

851
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:56,845
God bless you,
ma'am.

852
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:12,486
<i>Cool down, down
down by the bank</i>

853
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:15,690
<i>Banks of Jordan</i>

854
01:02:15,765 --> 01:02:21,294
<i>Cool down by
the banks of Jordan</i>

855
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:25,773
<i>Cool down by
down by the bank</i>

856
01:02:25,842 --> 01:02:28,106
Here, try this.

857
01:02:31,881 --> 01:02:35,908
So what do you think? They're okay.

858
01:02:35,985 --> 01:02:39,682
The truth.
Well...

859
01:02:42,291 --> 01:02:45,055
They're terrible.

860
01:02:45,128 --> 01:02:50,065
Oh, well, don't be shy.
Tell me how you feel.

861
01:02:50,133 --> 01:02:52,658
I will.

862
01:03:05,348 --> 01:03:07,509
What'd you go
and do that for?

863
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:13,584
I just thought you needed
a little coolin' off.

864
01:03:13,656 --> 01:03:17,752
You're right.

865
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:34,508
Try these.

866
01:03:38,347 --> 01:03:41,009
I think we need
to make a little paste.

867
01:04:00,102 --> 01:04:02,832
What in the name of
Christmas are you two doing?

868
01:04:02,905 --> 01:04:04,839
She's tryin' to teach me how to cook.

869
01:04:04,907 --> 01:04:07,774
Look at those
fried green tomatoes.

870
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:16,215
You better stop this. I'm gonna have
to arrest you for disorderly conduct.

871
01:04:16,285 --> 01:04:18,753
<i>Arrest us then.
Let me handle this.</i>

872
01:04:18,821 --> 01:04:21,085
All right.
Grady.

873
01:04:22,892 --> 01:04:25,383
Ha-ha-ha!

874
01:04:25,461 --> 01:04:29,625
Arrest us.
Go ahead, arrest us.

875
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:34,068
Ruth, I have to say it. I believe
Idgie's been a bad influence on ya.

876
01:04:34,136 --> 01:04:37,264
I agree.

877
01:04:37,974 --> 01:04:40,408
<i>I, I, I</i>

878
01:04:40,476 --> 01:04:45,311
<i>I, I,
I don't wanna</i>

879
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:49,147
Hear you weep no more
when I'm gone

880
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:54,019
Don't wanna hear you weep
when I'm gone in my grave

881
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:56,991
In my grave

882
01:05:16,279 --> 01:05:19,373
<i>I'll be back in a minute.</i>

883
01:05:19,448 --> 01:05:21,507
<i>Y'all keep the show
going till then.</i>

884
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:23,609
<i>We ain't goin'
nowhere.</i>

885
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:27,882
...down again.
She's still poorly.

886
01:05:27,957 --> 01:05:30,949
<i>- Where's the baby?
- Who are you?</i>

887
01:05:33,329 --> 01:05:35,695
<i>What do you want?</i>

888
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:38,598
<i>Frank!</i>

889
01:05:40,303 --> 01:05:42,897
<i>Get outta here.</i>

890
01:05:42,972 --> 01:05:46,703
<i>Get on outta here! Go on, get
outta here and leave us alone.</i>

891
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:49,074
Come on now, Ruth.

892
01:05:49,145 --> 01:05:53,844
You wouldn't deny a father the
right to see his son, would ya?

893
01:05:53,916 --> 01:05:56,714
<i>You git, I say. Scat you!</i>

894
01:05:56,786 --> 01:06:00,654
Damn! Gimme that. Let it go!

895
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:12,527
Well, that's my boy,
isn't it?

896
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:19,934
<i>Everything all right, ma'am?</i>

897
01:06:21,711 --> 01:06:25,704
Our guest
is just leavin'.

898
01:06:25,781 --> 01:06:27,715
<i>Come on, Frank, let's go.</i>

899
01:06:31,187 --> 01:06:34,122
I'll be back.

900
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:37,956
In the end, you and
the baby gonna be back.

901
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:45,157
I ain't scared
of you! No, sir!

902
01:06:45,234 --> 01:06:48,635
<i>You should be.</i>

903
01:06:58,381 --> 01:07:00,747
<i>Mind your manners, boy!</i>

904
01:07:09,658 --> 01:07:12,024
Grady,

905
01:07:12,094 --> 01:07:15,325
what does Gladys think
of you stayin' out late...

906
01:07:15,398 --> 01:07:19,698
and losin' your money to me
in poker night after night?

907
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:23,369
She likes it
just fine.

908
01:07:27,943 --> 01:07:30,571
They got Big George. Idgie!

909
01:07:30,646 --> 01:07:33,137
- Let go of him!
- Let me handle this!

910
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:37,083
We seen how you treat your niggers
around here and we don't like it.

911
01:07:37,153 --> 01:07:41,419
I'm the law in these parts. I don't
care what you like or don't like.

912
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:43,458
Turn him loose.

913
01:07:43,526 --> 01:07:46,723
<i>Don't get riled up,
nigger lover.</i>

914
01:07:46,796 --> 01:07:51,256
You deaf or somethin'?
I said, let him go!

915
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:54,302
<i>Before you get yourselves in a
whole lot of trouble! Calm down.</i>

916
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:57,134
We wanted to have
a little get-together...

917
01:07:57,206 --> 01:08:00,175
<i>and make sure we see
eye to eye on some things.</i>

918
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:03,678
<i>You hear me now?</i>

919
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:05,771
Let's let him go, boys.

920
01:08:05,848 --> 01:08:07,543
<i>We've had enough fun
for one night.</i>

921
01:08:07,616 --> 01:08:09,550
<i>Turn him loose.
Come on.</i>

922
01:08:09,618 --> 01:08:11,586
No, you're gonna
get in trouble.

923
01:08:14,156 --> 01:08:16,681
Well, now,
that's more like it.

924
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:19,694
Seems I don't recognize
any of you boys.

925
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:21,992
Y'all ain't from Whistle Stop,
are you?

926
01:08:25,034 --> 01:08:27,093
This ought to do it.

927
01:08:27,169 --> 01:08:30,161
I want to thank you,
Miss Idgie.

928
01:08:30,239 --> 01:08:35,404
Forget it. You'd have
done the same for me.

929
01:08:35,478 --> 01:08:39,278
Try to get some sleep.

930
01:08:44,086 --> 01:08:47,180
Who the hell
were those assholes?

931
01:08:47,256 --> 01:08:52,523
They's just some old boys from Georgia
come over here to put a scare in you.

932
01:08:52,595 --> 01:08:55,029
Well, it worked.

933
01:08:55,097 --> 01:08:57,793
One of'em was here
the other day for something,

934
01:08:57,867 --> 01:09:00,392
seen you sellin' food
to coloreds.

935
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:04,530
They decided to come back,
shake you up a bit.

936
01:09:04,607 --> 01:09:08,043
I told 'em we don't need anybody
from Georgia comin' over here...

937
01:09:08,110 --> 01:09:10,635
tellin' us what
we can or cannot do.

938
01:09:10,713 --> 01:09:15,878
They won't be back. I
guaran-gol-damn-tee you that.

939
01:09:15,951 --> 01:09:19,011
One other thing,
little Miss Smarty-pants,

940
01:09:19,088 --> 01:09:23,354
I do not wear a size 14 shoe...

941
01:09:23,425 --> 01:09:26,986
and I don't
much care for parades,

942
01:09:27,062 --> 01:09:30,657
bedsheets or otherwise.

943
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:47,608
<i>Hey. What's the matter?</i>

944
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:51,084
It was Frank.
He saw the baby.

945
01:09:51,153 --> 01:09:54,247
<i>You sure it was him?
Yes, I'm sure.</i>

946
01:09:54,323 --> 01:09:57,224
So that's why those
Kluxers were here.

947
01:09:57,293 --> 01:10:00,626
Let me take him.

948
01:10:02,064 --> 01:10:06,262
Don't worry. I mean, if he's
dumb enough to come back here,

949
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:09,236
Grady and the Alabama boys
will take care of him.

950
01:10:09,305 --> 01:10:13,332
If they don't,
I'll think of somethin'.

951
01:10:13,409 --> 01:10:16,310
Don't take
any chances.

952
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:19,677
Promise me you won't do
anythin' crazy, no matter what.

953
01:10:19,748 --> 01:10:23,309
Me?
Not me.

954
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:28,754
I'm gonna
put him down.

955
01:10:28,824 --> 01:10:30,689
<i>Hey, little Buddy.</i>

956
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:34,124
<i>That was the last
anyone saw of Frank Bennett...</i>

957
01:10:34,196 --> 01:10:36,494
<i>until the night
of the town follies.</i>

958
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:40,968
<i>Ruth was away at one of the
Reverend Scroggins' many revivals.</i>

959
01:10:41,036 --> 01:10:43,971
One thing a woman
expects when she gets married...

960
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:45,973
is sympathy.

961
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:48,441
Haven't you got that
since you married me?

962
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:52,970
I sure have...
from the whole town.

963
01:11:24,013 --> 01:11:27,346
Hey there! You got to come quick.

964
01:11:27,416 --> 01:11:30,579
Well, the show
has hardly begun.

965
01:11:30,653 --> 01:11:33,383
You got to come quick now.
You hear me?

966
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:38,423
Run, get help! Run,
quick! Where's the baby?

967
01:11:38,494 --> 01:11:40,519
Never mind.

968
01:11:59,948 --> 01:12:05,477
Excuse me, sir. I don't believe
you should be goin' anywhere...

969
01:12:05,554 --> 01:12:08,114
with Ruth's baby.

970
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:54,836
Thank you.

971
01:12:54,903 --> 01:12:57,337
Hi there. What can I do for you boys?

972
01:12:57,406 --> 01:12:59,340
Idgie.
Grady.

973
01:12:59,408 --> 01:13:02,571
This here is Sheriff
Curtis Smoote. Hi there.

974
01:13:02,644 --> 01:13:05,704
He's over here from Georgia.
He's lookin' for a fella. Oh.

975
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:10,909
You recognize him?
No.

976
01:13:10,986 --> 01:13:15,753
That's my husband, but I
haven't seen him in months.

977
01:13:15,824 --> 01:13:19,055
I heard he got run over
by a Brinks armored truck.

978
01:13:19,128 --> 01:13:21,153
What's he done?

979
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:25,223
Nothin' that we know of. We're tryin'
to find out what's been did to him.

980
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:28,792
He told his hired man he was
comin' to see his wife and baby,

981
01:13:28,871 --> 01:13:32,864
but he ain't never
showed up back home.

982
01:13:32,941 --> 01:13:35,637
Hell, I told him
if he showed up in this town,

983
01:13:35,711 --> 01:13:37,838
we'd all have known.

984
01:13:37,913 --> 01:13:40,347
Looks a little sissified
to me.

985
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:44,409
From what I hear,
most you boys in Georgia...

986
01:13:44,486 --> 01:13:45,919
<i>are a little light
on your feet.</i>

987
01:13:45,988 --> 01:13:49,151
That's the way
I heard it.

988
01:13:49,224 --> 01:13:51,351
Could I interest you
in some pie?

989
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:55,329
No, ma'am, but that
barbecue sure smells good.

990
01:13:55,397 --> 01:13:58,833
Best damn barbecue
in the state of Alabama.

991
01:14:28,063 --> 01:14:30,691
Here you go.
That's your 4th one today.

992
01:14:30,766 --> 01:14:33,599
I swear you're about
to eat up all my barbecue.

993
01:14:33,669 --> 01:14:39,474
Sit down.

994
01:14:41,076 --> 01:14:43,271
You ain't foolin' me,
girlie girl.

995
01:14:43,345 --> 01:14:46,007
I know who you are.

996
01:14:46,081 --> 01:14:49,244
I heard from Bennett's hired hand
that you threatened to kill Frank.

997
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:52,515
<i>He ain't showed up
dead yet.</i>

998
01:14:52,588 --> 01:14:56,354
But if he does, you in a whole
mess of trouble. You understand?

999
01:14:56,425 --> 01:15:00,486
<i>What we talkin'about
is murder here.</i>

1000
01:15:00,562 --> 01:15:03,759
<i>Runnin'a foul of the law
and nobody gets away with that,</i>

1001
01:15:03,832 --> 01:15:07,632
not even a bunch
of Alabama smart alecks.

1002
01:15:07,703 --> 01:15:10,331
If I find so much
as a hair of his head,

1003
01:15:10,405 --> 01:15:13,067
I'll arrest you faster
than you can slap a tick,

1004
01:15:13,141 --> 01:15:18,704
<i>'cause I'm the law,
and you can't beat the law.</i>

1005
01:15:38,967 --> 01:15:42,334
Hey there.

1006
01:15:42,404 --> 01:15:44,998
Tell me what he said.

1007
01:15:45,073 --> 01:15:49,942
Smoote's? I told you.
He said...

1008
01:15:50,012 --> 01:15:53,311
that was the best damn
barbecue he ever had.

1009
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:56,112
That's all?
No.

1010
01:15:56,184 --> 01:16:02,589
What else? He said the
pie was pretty good too.

1011
01:16:07,529 --> 01:16:10,191
You sure you ain't
never seen this man, boy?

1012
01:16:10,265 --> 01:16:13,894
<i>Yes, sir, and I already
told ya, I ain't never seen him.</i>

1013
01:16:13,969 --> 01:16:16,460
You'd do anything for
Miss Idgie, wouldn't ya, boy?

1014
01:16:18,373 --> 01:16:20,307
Yes, sir.

1015
01:16:23,545 --> 01:16:27,140
Would ya kill for her?
Did ya kill for her?

1016
01:16:34,523 --> 01:16:36,650
No, sir.

1017
01:16:36,725 --> 01:16:41,560
Well, now, maybe one of these
days you'll tell the truth.

1018
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:46,295
Just remember, we hang
lyin' niggers in Georgia...

1019
01:16:46,368 --> 01:16:49,337
just as fast as
they do in Alabama.

1020
01:16:49,404 --> 01:16:53,170
Yes, sir, I remember.

1021
01:17:30,746 --> 01:17:35,183
Sorry.

1022
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:40,187
What are ya doin' in
here? No milk in the house.

1023
01:17:40,255 --> 01:17:42,348
Where were you?

1024
01:17:42,424 --> 01:17:45,359
Takin' care of business,
havin' a good time.

1025
01:17:48,096 --> 01:17:51,657
I've been thinkin'
maybe I should move on...

1026
01:17:51,733 --> 01:17:54,201
<i>because of Frank
and all.</i>

1027
01:17:54,269 --> 01:17:59,206
I just don't want
you to feel like...

1028
01:17:59,274 --> 01:18:02,209
you have
to look out for us.

1029
01:18:02,277 --> 01:18:04,711
<i>I just...</i>

1030
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:07,010
don't want to be selfish,
that's all.

1031
01:18:07,082 --> 01:18:09,414
Maybe if I wasn't here,
you'd settle down.

1032
01:18:09,484 --> 01:18:14,387
I'm as settled
as I ever hope to be.

1033
01:18:29,004 --> 01:18:33,703
Then... why can't you
tell me where you were?

1034
01:18:43,819 --> 01:18:47,311
I had a dream...
the other night.

1035
01:18:47,389 --> 01:18:52,691
I dreamt that
Buddy was gone.

1036
01:18:52,761 --> 01:18:57,221
I ran to his crib and there
he was, sleepin' like an angel.

1037
01:18:57,299 --> 01:18:59,927
You know,
I thanked God...

1038
01:19:00,001 --> 01:19:02,970
for lettin' me
still have Buddy.

1039
01:19:03,038 --> 01:19:05,598
And I remembered...

1040
01:19:05,674 --> 01:19:09,405
havin' the same reaction
after Frank would beat me,

1041
01:19:09,478 --> 01:19:13,175
thankin' the Lord for givin' me
the strength to take it.

1042
01:19:13,248 --> 01:19:15,409
And I remembered...

1043
01:19:15,484 --> 01:19:19,921
thankin' the Lord
for each day my mother lived,

1044
01:19:20,989 --> 01:19:24,288
even when she was
spittin' up blood...

1045
01:19:24,359 --> 01:19:28,227
and prayin' for me
to kill her.

1046
01:19:28,296 --> 01:19:32,392
<i>I looked in my mother's eyes
pleadin'for me to help her...</i>

1047
01:19:32,467 --> 01:19:36,961
and all I could do
was pray.

1048
01:19:40,742 --> 01:19:44,735
While you were gone,
as I was holdin' Buddy,

1049
01:19:44,813 --> 01:19:49,273
I thought if that bastard,
Frank Bennett...

1050
01:19:49,351 --> 01:19:54,050
ever tries
to take my child,

1051
01:19:54,122 --> 01:19:57,558
I won't pray.

1052
01:19:57,626 --> 01:20:00,220
I'll break his neck.

1053
01:20:03,565 --> 01:20:07,592
<i>Ruth, you don't have to worry
about Frank Bennett anymore.</i>

1054
01:20:07,669 --> 01:20:11,298
How can you say that?
It's his child too.

1055
01:20:11,373 --> 01:20:14,103
He won't give up
on his blood.

1056
01:20:14,176 --> 01:20:17,543
I'm only gonna
tell you this one time.

1057
01:20:19,447 --> 01:20:22,883
Frank Bennett won't
be bothering you no more.

1058
01:20:22,951 --> 01:20:25,715
<i>Understand?</i>

1059
01:20:27,756 --> 01:20:30,156
You killed him,

1060
01:20:30,225 --> 01:20:33,092
<i>didn't you?</i>

1061
01:20:33,161 --> 01:20:35,425
No!

1062
01:20:42,337 --> 01:20:44,271
You don't believe me.

1063
01:20:44,339 --> 01:20:48,901
Right now, I don't know
what to believe.

1064
01:20:51,379 --> 01:20:54,678
Believe me when I tell ya
I don't want ya to move out.

1065
01:21:06,761 --> 01:21:12,165
<i>If I can help</i>

1066
01:21:12,234 --> 01:21:17,570
<i>Somebody</i>

1067
01:21:17,639 --> 01:21:20,199
<i>As I go</i>

1068
01:21:20,275 --> 01:21:23,608
<i>Finally.</i>

1069
01:21:23,678 --> 01:21:27,409
<i>Thanks, I've been
out here all day.</i>

1070
01:21:27,482 --> 01:21:31,009
<i>If I can show</i>

1071
01:21:31,086 --> 01:21:37,389
<i>Somebody</i>

1072
01:21:37,459 --> 01:21:40,895
<i>That they're travelin'</i>

1073
01:21:40,962 --> 01:21:44,557
<i>Travelin'wrong</i>

1074
01:21:44,633 --> 01:21:48,967
<i>Then my livin'
Hey...</i>

1075
01:21:49,037 --> 01:21:54,498
<i>Shall not
shall not be in vain</i>

1076
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:56,976
Excuse me.
I was waiting for that space.

1077
01:21:57,045 --> 01:22:01,982
Yeah? Tough! Face it, lady,
we're younger and faster.

1078
01:22:22,537 --> 01:22:25,438
Towanda.

1079
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:31,970
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

1080
01:22:32,047 --> 01:22:36,950
Yeah!
Whooo!

1081
01:22:41,323 --> 01:22:43,791
Towanda!

1082
01:22:48,663 --> 01:22:51,461
Yes, ma'am.

1083
01:22:51,533 --> 01:22:54,229
<i>Whoooo!</i>

1084
01:22:57,238 --> 01:23:00,730
Help, someone! What are
you doing? Are you crazy?

1085
01:23:00,809 --> 01:23:05,746
Face it, girls. I'm older,
and I have more insurance.

1086
01:23:14,356 --> 01:23:17,985
I never get mad, Mrs.
Threadgoode. Never!

1087
01:23:18,059 --> 01:23:20,619
The way I was raised
it was bad manners.

1088
01:23:20,695 --> 01:23:23,858
Well, I got mad
and it felt terrific.

1089
01:23:23,932 --> 01:23:27,231
I felt like I could beat
the shit outta all those punks!

1090
01:23:27,302 --> 01:23:30,032
Excuse my language.
Just beat 'em to a pulp!

1091
01:23:30,105 --> 01:23:32,232
Beat 'em till
they begged for mercy.

1092
01:23:32,307 --> 01:23:34,332
Towanda, the avenger!

1093
01:23:34,409 --> 01:23:37,435
After I wipe out
all the punks of this world,

1094
01:23:37,512 --> 01:23:39,980
I'll take on the wife beaters,
like Frank Bennett,

1095
01:23:40,048 --> 01:23:43,609
and machine gun
their genitals.

1096
01:23:43,685 --> 01:23:45,949
Towanda
will go on the rampage.

1097
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:48,717
<i>I'll put tiny bombs
in Penthouse and Playboy...</i>

1098
01:23:48,790 --> 01:23:50,985
so they'll explode
when you open 'em.

1099
01:23:51,059 --> 01:23:55,519
I'll ban all fashion models
who weigh less than 130 pounds.

1100
01:23:57,332 --> 01:24:00,893
I'll give half the military
budget to people over 65...

1101
01:24:00,969 --> 01:24:03,699
and declare wrinkles
sexually desirable.

1102
01:24:03,772 --> 01:24:08,402
Towanda, righter of wrongs,
queen beyond compare!

1103
01:24:08,476 --> 01:24:11,775
How many of them
hormones you takin', honey?

1104
01:24:19,287 --> 01:24:23,348
<i>Oh, when you give more
than you get</i>

1105
01:24:23,425 --> 01:24:27,191
<i>You're in danger
Well, honey,</i>

1106
01:24:27,262 --> 01:24:29,753
what I can't
understand is...

1107
01:24:29,831 --> 01:24:33,426
how in the hell
you can hit someone...

1108
01:24:33,501 --> 01:24:35,731
six times
by accident.

1109
01:24:35,804 --> 01:24:38,830
Oh, Ed, don't make
such a big deal about it.

1110
01:24:38,907 --> 01:24:43,003
<i>Who knows what evil lurks
within the hearts of men</i>

1111
01:24:43,078 --> 01:24:45,171
<i>When you find
that you're losin'</i>

1112
01:24:45,246 --> 01:24:49,774
- What the hell is this?
- A low cholesterol meal.

1113
01:24:49,851 --> 01:24:51,785
Happy Valentine's.

1114
01:24:51,853 --> 01:24:54,981
<i>That's danger and
heartbreak dead ahead</i>

1115
01:24:55,056 --> 01:24:57,991
<i>My God!
Are you tryin'to kill me?</i>

1116
01:24:58,059 --> 01:25:01,324
If I was gonna kill ya,
I'd use my hands.

1117
01:25:01,396 --> 01:25:05,765
Stop in the
name of love

1118
01:25:05,834 --> 01:25:09,235
Before you
break my heart

1119
01:25:09,304 --> 01:25:15,936
Think it over

1120
01:25:18,246 --> 01:25:20,840
I'm worried about
my little friend Evelyn.

1121
01:25:20,915 --> 01:25:23,475
She said her husband...

1122
01:25:23,551 --> 01:25:25,849
will just be watching
his sports on TV...

1123
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:29,083
and she has an urge to hit him
in the head with a baseball bat.

1124
01:25:29,157 --> 01:25:32,024
Hell, that
seems normal to me.

1125
01:25:32,093 --> 01:25:34,084
<i>Hi, Janeen.
Mm-hmm.</i>

1126
01:25:34,162 --> 01:25:36,630
Mrs. Threadgoode, would
you like some crudites?

1127
01:25:36,698 --> 01:25:41,101
Thank you, but this raw stuff
don't sit good with me.

1128
01:25:41,169 --> 01:25:45,333
Mrs. Threadgoode, you
have to tell me something.

1129
01:25:45,406 --> 01:25:50,173
Did Idgie murder Frank Bennett
or not? Hold your horses, honey.

1130
01:25:50,245 --> 01:25:53,271
Where were we?

1131
01:25:53,348 --> 01:25:56,078
You didn't kill Ed,
did ya?

1132
01:25:56,151 --> 01:25:59,814
Not yet.
Oh, good.

1133
01:25:59,888 --> 01:26:04,552
Anyway, five years had passed
since Frank Bennett disappeared.

1134
01:26:04,626 --> 01:26:09,325
<i>And Smokey Lonesome been
missin'ever since that same terrible night.</i>

1135
01:26:09,397 --> 01:26:12,457
<i>I 'member the day
when he showed up again.</i>

1136
01:26:13,401 --> 01:26:15,369
My God, son,

1137
01:26:15,436 --> 01:26:17,597
you're the spittin'
image of Ruth.

1138
01:26:17,672 --> 01:26:21,005
Buddy Threadgoode, Jr.
Nice to meet you, sir.

1139
01:26:21,075 --> 01:26:23,441
Well, sir,
Smokey Lonesome.

1140
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:26,708
<i>Curtis Smoote was making one
of his visits to Whistle Stop, Alabama,</i>

1141
01:26:26,781 --> 01:26:29,579
<i>still huntin'and peckin'
for any scrap of evidence...</i>

1142
01:26:29,651 --> 01:26:32,677
<i>about Frank Bennett's
whereabouts.</i>

1143
01:26:32,754 --> 01:26:35,245
<i>Who wants to begin? Oh, I do.</i>

1144
01:26:35,323 --> 01:26:37,154
<i>I do, Miss Ruth.
Thank you.</i>

1145
01:26:37,225 --> 01:26:40,490
We'll begin
on page five.

1146
01:26:40,562 --> 01:26:43,827
<i>Life has a funny
way of working things out.</i>

1147
01:26:43,898 --> 01:26:45,729
Well, hey there!

1148
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:49,361
<i>Smokey!
Idgie?</i>

1149
01:26:49,437 --> 01:26:52,964
Smokey Lonesome!
If it isn't old home week.

1150
01:26:53,041 --> 01:26:56,636
How are you? Well, I'm
rattlin' but I'm rollin'.

1151
01:26:56,711 --> 01:27:00,272
What brings you to these
parts? Smell of good cookin'.

1152
01:27:00,348 --> 01:27:01,940
Hey, Smokey.

1153
01:27:02,016 --> 01:27:05,076
Sipsey. Let me fix you some lunch.

1154
01:27:05,153 --> 01:27:09,556
You know just about everybody
except Curtis Smoote.

1155
01:27:09,624 --> 01:27:13,116
<i>He's the officer from
over at Valdosta, Georgia.</i>

1156
01:27:13,194 --> 01:27:17,290
He's been lookin' for the same man for
almost 5 years. Very stubborn fella.

1157
01:27:17,365 --> 01:27:21,301
<i>He loves our barbecue.</i>

1158
01:27:21,369 --> 01:27:22,700
<i>Mommy! Mommy!</i>

1159
01:27:30,878 --> 01:27:32,812
<i>Buddy.</i>

1160
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:34,814
Everybody
outta the way.

1161
01:27:34,882 --> 01:27:38,648
Give him here.
Let him go. I've got him.

1162
01:27:40,622 --> 01:27:42,817
Come on. You're
gonna be all right.

1163
01:27:42,890 --> 01:27:45,222
Open the door!

1164
01:27:45,293 --> 01:27:49,354
<i>Put him in the
car. It's all right, honey.</i>

1165
01:28:10,585 --> 01:28:12,485
<i>I can understand...</i>

1166
01:28:12,553 --> 01:28:15,078
having a funeral
for an arm.

1167
01:28:15,156 --> 01:28:18,683
I just don't know why she
insists on callin' him "Stump."

1168
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:21,752
<i>She say everybody
else gonna be callin'him that...</i>

1169
01:28:21,829 --> 01:28:25,925
so we might just as well
be the first.

1170
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:30,164
Okay, ice cream
and cake for everybody.

1171
01:28:30,238 --> 01:28:32,035
Go on.

1172
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:40,304
My daddy always used to say there
was a separate God for children.

1173
01:28:44,185 --> 01:28:47,712
<i>The good Lord was
watchin' over stump that day.</i>

1174
01:28:47,789 --> 01:28:51,156
<i>But then it started to rain
that month.</i>

1175
01:28:51,225 --> 01:28:56,060
<i>It rained and rained, and it
flooded parts of Whistle Stop.</i>

1176
01:28:56,130 --> 01:29:01,261
<i>That's why Grady's deputies stumbled
onto Frank Bennett's pickup truck,</i>

1177
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:05,329
<i>and I just knew Idgie'd
never get out of this mess.</i>

1178
01:29:05,406 --> 01:29:09,172
Now, you in or out? Remember,
I didn't take any cards.

1179
01:29:09,243 --> 01:29:11,677
Look at me and
let me see your face.

1180
01:29:11,746 --> 01:29:13,976
Idgie, I have to talk
to you. You're bluffin'.

1181
01:29:14,048 --> 01:29:17,814
Why don't you sit in? I'll deal
you a new hand. Gladys won't mind.

1182
01:29:17,885 --> 01:29:19,978
In private, Idgie.

1183
01:29:20,054 --> 01:29:23,080
Excuse us, Ruth.

1184
01:29:23,157 --> 01:29:27,423
A-ha. I'm just tryin' to teach
you not to fall for any tricks.

1185
01:29:27,495 --> 01:29:30,123
You're doin'
a great job.

1186
01:29:38,940 --> 01:29:41,170
What's your hurry?

1187
01:29:41,242 --> 01:29:44,473
And what is
so important?

1188
01:29:44,545 --> 01:29:46,775
What's that?

1189
01:29:46,848 --> 01:29:50,181
<i>Somebody found Frank
Bennett's truck in the river.</i>

1190
01:29:50,251 --> 01:29:53,414
What's that got
to do with me?

1191
01:29:53,488 --> 01:29:57,447
Officially, you and Big George
are under arrest for murder.

1192
01:29:57,525 --> 01:30:00,426
You're in my custody
until tomorrow.

1193
01:30:00,495 --> 01:30:03,191
I'm supposed to take you to
Georgia first thing in the morning.

1194
01:30:05,266 --> 01:30:07,461
<i>Unless, of course...</i>

1195
01:30:07,535 --> 01:30:10,265
Well, some people have
been known to pack up...

1196
01:30:10,338 --> 01:30:14,741
and sneak out of town
in the middle of the night.

1197
01:30:16,477 --> 01:30:19,037
<i>What about Big George?</i>

1198
01:30:19,113 --> 01:30:21,843
Well, the way
I figure it,

1199
01:30:21,916 --> 01:30:25,147
they'd be satisfied
if they had him.

1200
01:30:25,219 --> 01:30:27,278
Idgie,
this is serious.

1201
01:30:27,355 --> 01:30:29,949
We're talkin'
murder of a white man.

1202
01:30:30,024 --> 01:30:32,254
Someone's
gonna have to pay.

1203
01:30:32,326 --> 01:30:35,159
Nobody wants
to hang a woman.

1204
01:30:36,697 --> 01:30:38,688
No deal.

1205
01:30:38,766 --> 01:30:41,360
Idgie, I know how you feel
about Big George.

1206
01:30:41,436 --> 01:30:43,563
Hell, we all do.

1207
01:30:43,638 --> 01:30:46,801
But these just
the facts of life.

1208
01:30:49,243 --> 01:30:51,507
I can't do that.

1209
01:30:51,579 --> 01:30:54,343
Take me to jail
if you have to.

1210
01:30:54,415 --> 01:30:56,906
Well, that's what
I thought you'd say...

1211
01:30:56,984 --> 01:30:59,384
'cause you're absolutely,
unconditionally,

1212
01:30:59,454 --> 01:31:03,948
<i>positively the most stubborn
person I've known in my life.</i>

1213
01:31:05,793 --> 01:31:10,492
<i>Idgie and Big George went
to the county jail in Valdosta...</i>

1214
01:31:10,565 --> 01:31:14,365
<i>to await trial for
the murder of Frank Bennett.</i>

1215
01:31:14,435 --> 01:31:16,562
<i>They didn't have
to wait too long.</i>

1216
01:31:16,637 --> 01:31:20,038
Did you know Frank Bennett? No, sir.

1217
01:31:20,107 --> 01:31:22,507
You mean, you
never met the man...

1218
01:31:22,577 --> 01:31:27,105
<i>whose wife, Ruth, is your
business partner? That's right.</i>

1219
01:31:27,181 --> 01:31:30,014
You never threatened to kill
Frank Bennett at his home...

1220
01:31:30,084 --> 01:31:33,781
in front of his hired man
in June of 1932?

1221
01:31:33,855 --> 01:31:38,883
<i>The same Frank Bennett you did not
know. Oh, that was me, all right.</i>

1222
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:42,191
<i>I thought you wanted to know if we'd
ever met... and the answer is no.</i>

1223
01:31:42,263 --> 01:31:44,823
<i>Um, I threatened
to kill him,</i>

1224
01:31:44,899 --> 01:31:49,063
<i>but we were never, what you
might say, properly introduced.</i>

1225
01:31:49,136 --> 01:31:53,129
Is it not true that in September
of 1932 you came to Valdosta...

1226
01:31:53,207 --> 01:31:57,041
<i>and took Frank Bennett's wife and
child back to Alabama with you?</i>

1227
01:31:57,111 --> 01:31:59,579
Um... just the wife.
The child came later.

1228
01:31:59,647 --> 01:32:03,105
How much later? The usual. Nine months.

1229
01:32:03,184 --> 01:32:06,051
<i>I suggest that you bribed...</i>

1230
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:11,422
this poor, weak woman with
promises of liquor and money,

1231
01:32:11,492 --> 01:32:15,223
and she lost control
of her senses momentarily.

1232
01:32:15,296 --> 01:32:18,288
When her husband came back
to get her and take her home,

1233
01:32:18,366 --> 01:32:22,996
you and your colored man
murdered him in cold blood.

1234
01:32:24,205 --> 01:32:25,797
No, sir.

1235
01:32:25,873 --> 01:32:31,140
Well, where were you on the
night of September 30, 1933?

1236
01:32:31,212 --> 01:32:33,510
I was at the town hall
doing a show.

1237
01:32:33,581 --> 01:32:36,675
And after that? I was
at my mother's house.

1238
01:32:36,751 --> 01:32:39,276
Oh, yeah?
Who was with you?

1239
01:32:39,353 --> 01:32:43,687
<i>Just Big George and myself. What about
your mother? Can she confirm that?</i>

1240
01:32:43,758 --> 01:32:46,022
No, sir.
She died a year ago.

1241
01:32:46,093 --> 01:32:48,584
I'm sorry to hear that.

1242
01:32:48,663 --> 01:32:52,360
But do you expect 12 intelligent
men to believe you,

1243
01:32:52,433 --> 01:32:55,061
although one witness is dead and
the other is a colored man,

1244
01:32:55,136 --> 01:32:58,537
known to be a worthless,
no-good, lying nigger?

1245
01:32:58,606 --> 01:33:00,870
You expect these men
to take your word for it...

1246
01:33:00,942 --> 01:33:03,604
<i>Just because
you say so?</i>

1247
01:33:03,678 --> 01:33:08,206
That's right, you gump-faced,
blown-up, baboon-assed bastard!

1248
01:33:08,282 --> 01:33:11,740
<i>One more outburst like that...</i>

1249
01:33:11,819 --> 01:33:15,311
and I'll hold you in contempt
of court. You understand?

1250
01:33:15,389 --> 01:33:18,187
Yes, sir.

1251
01:33:19,894 --> 01:33:23,455
Oh, Lord.
Next witness.

1252
01:33:26,033 --> 01:33:27,500
<i>Did you know
that you were pregnant...</i>

1253
01:33:27,568 --> 01:33:30,503
<i>at the time
you left Valdosta?</i>

1254
01:33:30,571 --> 01:33:32,505
<i>Yes.</i>

1255
01:33:32,573 --> 01:33:36,168
<i>And yet, you tell us
over and over...</i>

1256
01:33:36,243 --> 01:33:40,805
<i>that you went with this
woman... willingly?</i>

1257
01:33:40,881 --> 01:33:45,079
Yes. I wouldn't raise
my child with Frank Bennett.

1258
01:33:45,152 --> 01:33:47,245
<i>But why?</i>

1259
01:33:47,321 --> 01:33:51,519
<i>Did this woman promise you money? No.</i>

1260
01:33:51,592 --> 01:33:54,152
<i>A bigger home?</i>

1261
01:33:54,228 --> 01:33:57,322
No. No.

1262
01:33:57,398 --> 01:34:00,026
<i>Then tell us,
Mrs. Bennett,</i>

1263
01:34:00,101 --> 01:34:02,626
<i>why would a respectable
Christian woman...</i>

1264
01:34:02,703 --> 01:34:05,501
<i>go anywhere with this Idgie
Threadgoode... I object.</i>

1265
01:34:05,573 --> 01:34:07,700
<i>Whose reputation
is known far and wide...</i>

1266
01:34:07,775 --> 01:34:10,005
<i>as a notorious liar
and drunkard?</i>

1267
01:34:10,077 --> 01:34:12,375
<i>- Objection!
- Sustained!</i>

1268
01:34:15,783 --> 01:34:18,081
<i>Why did you leave...</i>

1269
01:34:18,152 --> 01:34:22,111
<i>with Idgie Threadgoode
that day?</i>

1270
01:34:23,524 --> 01:34:26,823
<i>Answer the
question, Mrs. Bennett.</i>

1271
01:34:27,695 --> 01:34:30,721
Because she...

1272
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:35,894
She's the best friend
I ever had,

1273
01:34:35,970 --> 01:34:38,063
and I love her.

1274
01:34:38,773 --> 01:34:41,674
<i>Thank you, Mrs.
Bennett. That will be all.</i>

1275
01:34:41,742 --> 01:34:44,575
<i>The defense
calls as its last witness...</i>

1276
01:34:44,645 --> 01:34:47,375
<i>the Rev.
Herbert Scroggins.</i>

1277
01:34:48,716 --> 01:34:51,708
Place your right hand
on the Bible, please.

1278
01:34:51,786 --> 01:34:54,983
I brought my own,
if you don't mind.

1279
01:34:55,056 --> 01:34:59,117
You swear to tell the whole
truth and nothing but the truth?

1280
01:34:59,193 --> 01:35:01,184
I do.

1281
01:35:03,230 --> 01:35:07,462
<i>You have
information about the whereabouts...</i>

1282
01:35:07,535 --> 01:35:11,130
<i>of Idgie Threadgoode and her
colored man, known as Big George,</i>

1283
01:35:11,205 --> 01:35:14,971
on the night
of September 30, 1933?

1284
01:35:15,042 --> 01:35:17,010
Yes, sir,
I do.

1285
01:35:17,078 --> 01:35:19,512
<i>It has been
suggested here...</i>

1286
01:35:19,580 --> 01:35:23,038
<i>that she and her colored man
were at her mother's house.</i>

1287
01:35:23,117 --> 01:35:27,349
<i>Can you confirm that?
No, sir. That is a lie.</i>

1288
01:35:27,421 --> 01:35:30,151
Oh, shit.

1289
01:35:30,224 --> 01:35:33,455
<i>It has been my
habit to write all the dates...</i>

1290
01:35:33,527 --> 01:35:36,462
<i>of the activities of
the church in my Bible.</i>

1291
01:35:36,530 --> 01:35:41,194
<i>I show that the night
of September 30, 1933...</i>

1292
01:35:41,268 --> 01:35:44,294
was the start of our
annual revival...

1293
01:35:44,371 --> 01:35:47,135
down at the
Baptist campground.

1294
01:35:47,208 --> 01:35:49,301
Sister Threadgoode
was there...

1295
01:35:49,376 --> 01:35:53,403
<i>along with her hired man,
George Pullman,</i>

1296
01:35:53,481 --> 01:35:57,611
who was in charge of the
barbecue as he has been...

1297
01:35:57,685 --> 01:36:00,347
<i>for the last ten years.
Objection.</i>

1298
01:36:00,421 --> 01:36:04,949
That doesn't mean anything. Murder could've
taken place any time the next couple of days.

1299
01:36:05,025 --> 01:36:10,053
<i>Have you ever been to one of
our revivals, sir? Well, no.</i>

1300
01:36:10,131 --> 01:36:12,190
Do you attend church
regularly, sir?

1301
01:36:12,266 --> 01:36:14,461
'Course I do.

1302
01:36:14,535 --> 01:36:19,063
<i>Good. Well, maybe if you
attended one of our revivals,</i>

1303
01:36:19,140 --> 01:36:21,506
<i>you'd know
they last three days...</i>

1304
01:36:21,575 --> 01:36:23,907
and three nights,
Your Honor.

1305
01:36:26,180 --> 01:36:29,149
<i>Approach the bench.</i>

1306
01:36:29,216 --> 01:36:33,915
Percy, it don't look like
you got a case at all.

1307
01:36:33,988 --> 01:36:36,548
In the first place,
there's no body.

1308
01:36:36,624 --> 01:36:39,889
Second, we got us a preacher
nobody's gonna dispute.

1309
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:44,158
But, Your Honor... I'm tellin' you.
What you got is a lot of nothing.

1310
01:36:44,231 --> 01:36:47,462
<i>I say Frank
Bennett got himself drunk,</i>

1311
01:36:47,535 --> 01:36:51,699
<i>drove into the river and
was long ago eaten up...</i>

1312
01:36:51,772 --> 01:36:54,935
and I don't give
a good goddamn!

1313
01:36:55,009 --> 01:36:58,467
What we got here is a
case of accidental death.

1314
01:36:58,546 --> 01:37:00,173
Case dismissed.

1315
01:37:00,247 --> 01:37:02,681
Whoo!

1316
01:37:09,623 --> 01:37:12,524
See you in church,
Sister?

1317
01:37:13,427 --> 01:37:15,657
Reverend.

1318
01:37:15,729 --> 01:37:20,029
I can't believe he
actually swore on a Bible.

1319
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:22,034
Well, not really.

1320
01:37:22,102 --> 01:37:24,093
If that judge
had looked closer,

1321
01:37:24,171 --> 01:37:27,231
<i>he'd have seen it was really
a copy of Moby Dick.</i>

1322
01:37:29,276 --> 01:37:33,679
But why did he do it? For the sheer
joy of seeing you in church again...

1323
01:37:33,747 --> 01:37:36,580
which I suggested to him
might be your penance.

1324
01:37:36,650 --> 01:37:39,278
You didn't promise him,
did you? Yes, ma'am, I did.

1325
01:37:39,353 --> 01:37:41,287
And I never
break my word.

1326
01:37:41,355 --> 01:37:45,724
If I live 1,000 years,
I will never forgive you.

1327
01:37:45,793 --> 01:37:49,957
I don't know what's worse,
church or jail.

1328
01:38:00,941 --> 01:38:04,069
There now.
Don't you look pretty?

1329
01:38:04,144 --> 01:38:06,271
Oh, yes, honey.

1330
01:38:06,347 --> 01:38:11,011
You'll have me lookin' like
Ginger Rogers before you're done.

1331
01:38:11,085 --> 01:38:15,317
Don't let Mr. Dunaway see me.
He's liable to go wild.

1332
01:38:16,824 --> 01:38:20,055
I'm glad to see
you're in a good mood.

1333
01:38:20,127 --> 01:38:23,255
You've slimmed down quite a bit
in the last few weeks.

1334
01:38:23,330 --> 01:38:27,630
I'm just so happy Big George
and Idgie got off.

1335
01:38:27,701 --> 01:38:30,693
I would have killed Frank
Bennett if I could've.

1336
01:38:30,771 --> 01:38:33,296
Did anybody really
think she did it?

1337
01:38:33,374 --> 01:38:36,002
Some said yes,
some said no.

1338
01:38:36,076 --> 01:38:39,204
'Course the only one who really
knew was Frank Bennett.

1339
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:44,684
And you know what they say.
Dead men tell no tales.

1340
01:38:45,352 --> 01:38:47,650
<i>Towanda-a-a!</i>

1341
01:39:10,945 --> 01:39:13,971
Evelyn, what in the hell
are you doing?

1342
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:16,949
I need some light
and air.

1343
01:39:17,017 --> 01:39:20,214
Why don't you take one of
your walks or your jog...

1344
01:39:20,287 --> 01:39:23,814
or whatever it is
you do?

1345
01:39:23,891 --> 01:39:26,792
There's no dinner
either!

1346
01:39:26,860 --> 01:39:31,297
Ed, you have any idea why I've
been goin' to all these classes?

1347
01:39:31,365 --> 01:39:34,892
<i>No. I've been trying
to save our marriage.</i>

1348
01:39:34,969 --> 01:39:36,994
What's the point
of my tryin'...

1349
01:39:37,071 --> 01:39:41,735
if you're gonna sit on
your butt drinking beer...

1350
01:39:41,809 --> 01:39:44,642
and watching baseball,
basketball, football...

1351
01:39:44,712 --> 01:39:47,840
bowling and hockey
and golf...

1352
01:39:47,915 --> 01:39:51,783
<i>and Challenge
of the Gladiators?</i>

1353
01:39:57,491 --> 01:40:02,019
<i>Mrs. Couch, I'm Sue,
Mrs. Otis'daughter-in-law.</i>

1354
01:40:02,096 --> 01:40:05,532
How are you? I've heard about
you from Mrs. Threadgoode.

1355
01:40:05,599 --> 01:40:09,296
She is so sweet. She's been
lookin' after my mother-in-law.

1356
01:40:09,370 --> 01:40:12,134
Now, how is Mrs. Otis doin', by the way?

1357
01:40:12,206 --> 01:40:16,666
Much better, thank you. It takes
time getting used to a strange place.

1358
01:40:16,744 --> 01:40:20,771
I'm glad to hear it. Mrs.
Threadgoode's been anxious to get home.

1359
01:40:20,848 --> 01:40:25,046
Mrs. Couch, Mrs. Threadgoode
doesn't have a house anymore.

1360
01:40:25,119 --> 01:40:28,577
They tore that down. What?

1361
01:40:28,655 --> 01:40:32,887
They had to. It was falling
apart, and it was condemned.

1362
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:35,895
Oh, no.

1363
01:40:35,963 --> 01:40:40,161
<i>Does she know that? No, well, we
didn't see any point in telling her.</i>

1364
01:40:40,234 --> 01:40:42,725
<i>It would just break her heart,
poor old thing.</i>

1365
01:40:42,803 --> 01:40:46,739
But I am so glad
I got a chance to meet you.

1366
01:40:46,807 --> 01:40:50,004
You take care of yourself now.
Bye-bye.

1367
01:41:59,980 --> 01:42:02,278
Oh, Evelyn, hey!

1368
01:42:02,349 --> 01:42:04,817
Hey.

1369
01:42:04,885 --> 01:42:07,251
Do you like
my roses?

1370
01:42:07,321 --> 01:42:10,654
Since I can't get home
to look at my own roses...

1371
01:42:10,724 --> 01:42:13,090
I made myself
a paper garden.

1372
01:42:13,160 --> 01:42:16,652
<i>Got everything but the
bugs. They're lovely.</i>

1373
01:42:16,730 --> 01:42:19,995
You been here long?
Happy birthday!

1374
01:42:20,067 --> 01:42:22,558
Oh! I shouldn't have woken you up.

1375
01:42:22,636 --> 01:42:26,902
'Course you should've. Don't you never let
me sleep through a visitor's day, honey.

1376
01:42:26,974 --> 01:42:31,707
I look forward to them all
week. So do I, Mrs. Threadgoode.

1377
01:42:31,778 --> 01:42:35,111
Oh! I can't
believe you remembered.

1378
01:42:35,182 --> 01:42:39,380
You made me
fried green tomatoes!

1379
01:42:41,822 --> 01:42:43,847
Mmm!
They're delicious.

1380
01:42:43,924 --> 01:42:47,257
It's your recipe. Are they
cold? No. They're just the way...

1381
01:42:47,327 --> 01:42:51,593
we used to have 'em at
the Whistle Stop Cafe. Mmm!

1382
01:42:51,665 --> 01:42:55,601
You couldn't be sweeter to me
if you was my own daughter.

1383
01:42:55,669 --> 01:42:57,830
Here's your napkin.

1384
01:42:57,905 --> 01:42:59,930
And wait-wait-wait.

1385
01:43:00,007 --> 01:43:02,567
Queen, queen.

1386
01:43:05,746 --> 01:43:09,876
You know,
I don't feel 83.

1387
01:43:09,950 --> 01:43:14,080
It sorta slipped up on me.

1388
01:43:16,190 --> 01:43:19,626
I never expected
to live this long.

1389
01:43:19,693 --> 01:43:25,290
'Course, the Lord takes us home
when he wants us.

1390
01:43:34,308 --> 01:43:37,937
Are you all right?

1391
01:43:38,011 --> 01:43:40,343
I was thinking
about Ruth.

1392
01:43:40,414 --> 01:43:43,212
After the trial
was over,

1393
01:43:43,283 --> 01:43:45,478
everything went back
to normal...

1394
01:43:45,552 --> 01:43:49,318
<i>till that fall
when Ruth lost her appetite.</i>

1395
01:43:49,389 --> 01:43:51,949
<i>By the time Doc Hadley
looked at her,</i>

1396
01:43:52,025 --> 01:43:56,223
<i>he said the cancer was so bad
she only had a couple of weeks.</i>

1397
01:43:56,296 --> 01:43:59,026
<i>Well, we moved her
to the Threadgoode house...</i>

1398
01:43:59,099 --> 01:44:03,934
<i>and put her downstairs
so she'd be more comfortable.</i>

1399
01:44:04,004 --> 01:44:08,498
<i>Sipsey moved in with her
and never left her side.</i>

1400
01:44:08,575 --> 01:44:10,702
<i>Hold on, baby. I'm right here.</i>

1401
01:44:10,777 --> 01:44:15,441
<i>Idgie just prayed for a miracle.</i>

1402
01:44:34,735 --> 01:44:38,193
Now, listen to me.

1403
01:44:38,272 --> 01:44:40,797
Make sure he graduates.

1404
01:44:40,874 --> 01:44:45,072
And don't... let him
come to the funeral.

1405
01:44:45,145 --> 01:44:47,807
I don't want him going
through that mess.

1406
01:44:47,881 --> 01:44:51,180
Would you quit talkin'
like that?

1407
01:44:51,251 --> 01:44:53,742
What funeral?

1408
01:44:53,820 --> 01:44:56,186
You're gonna be back on
your feet feelin' just fine...

1409
01:44:56,256 --> 01:44:58,918
<i>in just a few days.</i>

1410
01:44:58,992 --> 01:45:01,893
<i>Just you wait.</i>

1411
01:45:01,962 --> 01:45:05,090
Oh, what's the matter,
son?

1412
01:45:10,937 --> 01:45:14,600
Well,
let's go for a walk.

1413
01:45:15,309 --> 01:45:16,901
<i>Did you get into a fight?</i>

1414
01:45:16,977 --> 01:45:19,673
I got punched
in the nose.

1415
01:45:19,746 --> 01:45:23,238
I can't play
like everyone else.

1416
01:45:23,317 --> 01:45:26,844
Did I ever tell you the
story about... the oysters?

1417
01:45:26,920 --> 01:45:29,388
All the millions of'em
just lying around...

1418
01:45:29,456 --> 01:45:34,291
And God put sand in one of'em,
and it makes a pearl. Oh.

1419
01:45:36,063 --> 01:45:38,725
Did I ever tell you about
Eva's three-legged dog?

1420
01:45:38,799 --> 01:45:40,892
How it never felt sorry
for itself...

1421
01:45:40,967 --> 01:45:44,596
and how I ought to be smarter than a
dumb dog and not feel sorry for myself.

1422
01:45:46,406 --> 01:45:49,739
You listen to everything
I say, don't you?

1423
01:45:49,810 --> 01:45:52,779
You get real mad at me
when I don't.

1424
01:45:52,846 --> 01:45:54,541
Well,

1425
01:45:57,017 --> 01:46:00,009
you know about
your mama.

1426
01:46:00,087 --> 01:46:02,578
She's sick.

1427
01:46:02,656 --> 01:46:04,681
Mm-hmm.

1428
01:46:06,226 --> 01:46:09,662
See, now is the time
for courage.

1429
01:46:09,730 --> 01:46:13,427
<i>I guess you already know
that there are...</i>

1430
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:16,492
angels masqueradin' as people
walkin' around this planet,

1431
01:46:16,570 --> 01:46:19,733
and your mom's
the bravest one of those.

1432
01:46:24,010 --> 01:46:26,103
Come here.

1433
01:46:33,820 --> 01:46:36,220
Mama, I can hit!
You should see me.

1434
01:46:36,289 --> 01:46:39,087
Idgie, she hit me in
the back with a curveball.

1435
01:46:39,159 --> 01:46:41,320
I didn't duck,
and I hardly cried.

1436
01:46:41,395 --> 01:46:44,853
She hit you?

1437
01:46:44,931 --> 01:46:48,924
Well, she did that
to me once too,

1438
01:46:49,002 --> 01:46:51,766
but I think
I did cry.

1439
01:46:53,673 --> 01:46:57,632
<i>Mama, I'm sorry
if you're sad.</i>

1440
01:46:57,711 --> 01:47:00,009
Well,

1441
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:03,174
give me a big kiss then,
and I'll never be sad again.

1442
01:47:10,724 --> 01:47:13,625
And you best not be sad
neither.

1443
01:47:13,693 --> 01:47:16,924
You understand?

1444
01:47:16,997 --> 01:47:18,931
You promise?

1445
01:47:18,999 --> 01:47:21,024
Promise.

1446
01:47:21,101 --> 01:47:25,037
Attaboy.
You go and wash up.

1447
01:47:48,862 --> 01:47:50,887
Sweet baby.

1448
01:47:54,868 --> 01:47:58,133
You two
be alone now.

1449
01:47:58,839 --> 01:48:02,502
Hey, girl.

1450
01:48:05,011 --> 01:48:07,070
No.

1451
01:48:09,015 --> 01:48:12,075
That's nice.

1452
01:48:13,086 --> 01:48:16,783
Will you do one thing
for me?

1453
01:48:16,857 --> 01:48:20,452
Yeah, anything.
Be good to yourself.

1454
01:48:20,527 --> 01:48:23,462
Even...

1455
01:48:23,530 --> 01:48:26,055
settle down if
you can find someone...

1456
01:48:26,132 --> 01:48:28,862
who can beat you
in poker.

1457
01:48:36,576 --> 01:48:41,536
There's so many things
I want to say to you.

1458
01:48:41,615 --> 01:48:44,140
No.

1459
01:48:44,985 --> 01:48:47,647
I love your stories.

1460
01:48:47,721 --> 01:48:50,656
Tell me a story,
Idgie.

1461
01:48:53,527 --> 01:48:57,361
Oh, God.

1462
01:48:57,430 --> 01:49:00,524
<i>Go on,
you old bee charmer.</i>

1463
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:04,263
<i>Tell me
a good tall tale.</i>

1464
01:49:05,672 --> 01:49:09,369
Tell me the one
about the lake.

1465
01:49:10,677 --> 01:49:15,307
What lake? The one...
that used to be here.

1466
01:49:17,450 --> 01:49:19,384
Oh.

1467
01:49:21,454 --> 01:49:25,015
Well, that was
just a lie.

1468
01:49:25,091 --> 01:49:27,855
I know that, fool.

1469
01:49:27,928 --> 01:49:29,987
Tell me anyway.

1470
01:49:30,063 --> 01:49:33,464
Tell me the story.

1471
01:49:35,035 --> 01:49:38,471
Well...

1472
01:49:40,507 --> 01:49:42,975
one time...

1473
01:49:43,043 --> 01:49:45,841
there was this lake.

1474
01:49:50,283 --> 01:49:54,652
And, uh, it was
right outside of town.

1475
01:49:54,721 --> 01:50:00,159
We used to go fishin' and
swimmin' and canoein' in it.

1476
01:50:00,226 --> 01:50:03,457
And see,
one November...

1477
01:50:03,530 --> 01:50:05,828
this big flock
of ducks...

1478
01:50:05,899 --> 01:50:10,927
came in and landed
on that lake and, uh,

1479
01:50:11,004 --> 01:50:15,839
and then the temperature dropped so fast
that the lake just froze right there.

1480
01:50:15,909 --> 01:50:18,173
And the, uh,

1481
01:50:18,244 --> 01:50:22,010
the ducks, they...

1482
01:50:22,082 --> 01:50:26,246
flew off, you see,
and took that lake with 'em.

1483
01:50:26,319 --> 01:50:29,550
And, uh,

1484
01:50:29,623 --> 01:50:34,617
now they say that lake is
somewhere over in Georgia.

1485
01:50:34,694 --> 01:50:37,754
Can you imagine?

1486
01:51:35,455 --> 01:51:38,720
It's all right,
honey.

1487
01:51:38,792 --> 01:51:44,761
Let her go.

1488
01:51:44,831 --> 01:51:49,063
You know,
Miss Ruth was a lady.

1489
01:51:49,135 --> 01:51:52,400
And a lady
always knows...

1490
01:51:52,472 --> 01:51:55,464
when to leave.

1491
01:52:00,980 --> 01:52:05,076
<i>When I think on
our departed sister, Ruth Jamison,</i>

1492
01:52:05,151 --> 01:52:08,245
<i>I'm reminded of our
Lord's Sermon on the Mount...</i>

1493
01:52:08,321 --> 01:52:10,789
<i>and how his teachings...</i>

1494
01:52:10,857 --> 01:52:15,294
<i>It's funny how
strong Ruth affected everyone,</i>

1495
01:52:15,361 --> 01:52:18,762
<i>even Smokey Lonesome.</i>

1496
01:52:18,832 --> 01:52:21,494
<i>When he died
a few years back...</i>

1497
01:52:21,568 --> 01:52:24,264
<i>he had one possession
on him,</i>

1498
01:52:24,337 --> 01:52:26,931
<i>a picture of Ruth.</i>

1499
01:52:28,308 --> 01:52:32,404
<i>He was in love with her
from the first time he saw her.</i>

1500
01:52:32,479 --> 01:52:35,346
<i>We all were.</i>

1501
01:52:41,321 --> 01:52:43,789
I shouldn't
a-told you this.

1502
01:52:45,725 --> 01:52:49,684
I hate death.
It scares me so.

1503
01:52:49,763 --> 01:52:52,288
Death is nothin'
to be afraid of!

1504
01:52:52,365 --> 01:52:55,425
Look at me. I'm at
the jumpin'-off place,

1505
01:52:55,502 --> 01:52:58,733
<i>and I ain't afraid
one bit.</i>

1506
01:52:58,805 --> 01:53:02,502
Oh, Ninny,
you're so brave.

1507
01:53:04,077 --> 01:53:08,013
Ruth and Idgie were brave,
not me.

1508
01:53:08,081 --> 01:53:11,448
I wouldn't be afraid
of death if I was you.

1509
01:53:11,518 --> 01:53:16,455
I'd be more afraid of driving
in rush-hour traffic.

1510
01:53:18,725 --> 01:53:23,662
Oh-oh-oh

1511
01:53:23,730 --> 01:53:26,563
Just listen to that rain

1512
01:53:26,633 --> 01:53:29,101
A-rainin' in the north

1513
01:53:29,169 --> 01:53:30,761
A-rainin' in the south

1514
01:53:30,837 --> 01:53:34,136
A-rainin' in the east

1515
01:53:34,207 --> 01:53:36,368
A-rainin' in the west

1516
01:53:36,442 --> 01:53:38,842
Ooh-ooh

1517
01:53:38,912 --> 01:53:42,439
Tell me didn't it rain
children

1518
01:53:42,515 --> 01:53:44,449
<i>Rain all night long</i>

1519
01:53:44,517 --> 01:53:46,678
<i>Didn't it
you know it did</i>

1520
01:53:46,753 --> 01:53:51,019
<i>I said, o my good Lord
didn't it rain</i>

1521
01:53:51,090 --> 01:53:54,526
Hey, it rained 40 days and
40 nights without stoppin'

1522
01:53:54,594 --> 01:53:56,994
Noah got worried
and the rain kept a-droppin'

1523
01:53:57,063 --> 01:53:59,463
He sent out a raven
Sent out a dove

1524
01:53:59,532 --> 01:54:01,830
The water, good God
came down from above

1525
01:54:01,901 --> 01:54:04,165
<i>They tell me my God
went and sent the rain</i>

1526
01:54:04,237 --> 01:54:06,671
The women and the children
did begin to scream

1527
01:54:06,739 --> 01:54:08,798
They knocked on the windows
and they batted at the doors

1528
01:54:08,875 --> 01:54:11,776
While they... Hoo, hoo
Take on more

1529
01:54:11,845 --> 01:54:14,109
<i>Noah said
No, no, my friend</i>

1530
01:54:14,180 --> 01:54:16,307
<i>God said
I can't let you in</i>

1531
01:54:16,382 --> 01:54:19,010
Hoo, hoo

1532
01:54:19,085 --> 01:54:21,519
Listen to the rain

1533
01:54:21,588 --> 01:54:26,321
Uh-oh
Just listen to the rain

1534
01:54:26,392 --> 01:54:28,690
Listen to the rain

1535
01:54:28,761 --> 01:54:30,786
Just listen to the rain
Oh, oh

1536
01:54:30,864 --> 01:54:33,833
Listen, a-listen to the rain
Oh, oh, listen

1537
01:54:33,900 --> 01:54:36,266
Listen to the rain
Yeah, yeah, listen

1538
01:54:36,336 --> 01:54:38,770
Listen to the rain
Uh-oh, listen

1539
01:54:38,838 --> 01:54:41,329
<i>Listen to the rain
Yeah, yeah, listen</i>

1540
01:54:41,407 --> 01:54:45,867
<i>Last chance
Listen to the rain now</i>

1541
01:54:45,945 --> 01:54:48,539
<i>And then drip, drop
drip, drop</i>

1542
01:54:48,615 --> 01:54:52,745
Drip, drop drip,
drip, a-drop drip, drop

1543
01:54:53,419 --> 01:54:55,853
<i>Yeah, drip, drip, a-drop</i>

1544
01:54:55,922 --> 01:54:58,083
<i>Now, drip, drop</i>

1545
01:54:58,157 --> 01:55:01,957
<i>Drip, drip, a-drop</i>

1546
01:55:11,671 --> 01:55:14,663
Hi, honey.
Look what I got you.

1547
01:55:14,741 --> 01:55:16,766
Ah...

1548
01:55:16,843 --> 01:55:20,301
Ed, how sweet!

1549
01:55:20,380 --> 01:55:22,814
Lilies! My favorite. Yeah.

1550
01:55:22,882 --> 01:55:26,010
I know.
Sometimes I even amaze myself.

1551
01:55:26,085 --> 01:55:30,181
What's the occasion?
Oh, honey, I just...

1552
01:55:30,256 --> 01:55:33,225
feel sorry about
the past few months.

1553
01:55:33,293 --> 01:55:37,286
I don't know what you're really
up to and what's going on with you,

1554
01:55:37,363 --> 01:55:41,766
but I guess I could've been more helpful
with your job and everything, you know.

1555
01:55:43,002 --> 01:55:44,867
Well, why are you...

1556
01:55:44,938 --> 01:55:47,907
puttin' up this wall
where you just tore one down?

1557
01:55:47,974 --> 01:55:51,102
Well...
I changed my mind.

1558
01:55:51,177 --> 01:55:53,941
I don't mean to seem
dense or anything,

1559
01:55:54,013 --> 01:55:58,245
but what's changed?
The air and the light.

1560
01:56:00,620 --> 01:56:03,214
Ed...
Hmm?

1561
01:56:03,289 --> 01:56:05,757
You remember how
you used to tell me...

1562
01:56:05,825 --> 01:56:08,555
you always wanted
two women in your house?

1563
01:56:08,628 --> 01:56:10,926
Oh, God.

1564
01:56:10,997 --> 01:56:12,658
Yeah.

1565
01:56:12,732 --> 01:56:14,757
Well...

1566
01:56:14,834 --> 01:56:17,769
what if I was
the younger of the two?

1567
01:56:17,837 --> 01:56:21,364
I don't believe
I get your drift.

1568
01:56:21,441 --> 01:56:25,969
I want something more than I've
ever wanted anything before.

1569
01:56:26,045 --> 01:56:28,809
I want to bring
Mrs. Threadgoode...

1570
01:56:28,881 --> 01:56:31,076
to our home.

1571
01:56:31,150 --> 01:56:33,778
I want her
to live here with us.

1572
01:56:33,853 --> 01:56:36,344
I want to give her the love
she's given me.

1573
01:56:36,422 --> 01:56:40,586
You're kiddin' me,
aren't you? I'm absolutely serious.

1574
01:56:40,660 --> 01:56:45,495
That's why I'm puttin' the
wall to Kyle's room back up.

1575
01:56:45,565 --> 01:56:48,625
Well, honey, this isn't
something you're just go and do.

1576
01:56:48,701 --> 01:56:51,363
I mean,
she's an old woman.

1577
01:56:51,437 --> 01:56:54,668
What if she got sick?
Who's gonna take care of her?

1578
01:56:54,741 --> 01:56:56,436
I will!

1579
01:56:56,509 --> 01:56:58,500
I can't leave her
in that place.

1580
01:56:58,578 --> 01:57:02,480
She's not a stray cat.
Hell, she isn't even family.

1581
01:57:02,548 --> 01:57:05,608
She's family to me.
Now, Evelyn.

1582
01:57:06,452 --> 01:57:09,512
<i>Evelyn?</i>

1583
01:57:09,589 --> 01:57:11,454
<i>Honey?</i>

1584
01:57:11,524 --> 01:57:13,515
<i>Ah, look...</i>

1585
01:57:13,593 --> 01:57:17,825
have you mentioned this
harebrained idea to her?

1586
01:57:17,897 --> 01:57:20,957
Not yet.
Well, good!

1587
01:57:21,034 --> 01:57:23,502
Then we'll just pretend
it never happened.

1588
01:57:23,569 --> 01:57:26,595
I'm making my own money.
I'll pay for everything.

1589
01:57:26,672 --> 01:57:30,233
You don't have to do
a thing.

1590
01:57:30,309 --> 01:57:32,800
Evelyn...

1591
01:57:32,879 --> 01:57:35,347
it's never
gonna happen.

1592
01:57:35,415 --> 01:57:38,077
So just forget
about it.

1593
01:57:39,685 --> 01:57:42,449
Don't you ever
say "never" to me.

1594
01:57:51,397 --> 01:57:54,195
Someone helped put a mirror
up in front of my face,

1595
01:57:54,267 --> 01:57:56,861
and I didn't like
what I saw one bit.

1596
01:57:56,936 --> 01:58:00,770
You know what I did?
I changed.

1597
01:58:00,840 --> 01:58:04,742
And that someone...
was Mrs. Threadgoode.

1598
01:58:04,811 --> 01:58:09,305
She needs my love and care,
and I'm gonna give it to her.

1599
01:58:11,084 --> 01:58:14,713
If you'll excuse me,
I have to go to the gym.

1600
01:58:19,659 --> 01:58:22,685
And if you won't listen
to reason...

1601
01:58:22,762 --> 01:58:26,391
there's always Towanda.

1602
01:58:41,180 --> 01:58:44,149
Hey, Nin...

1603
01:58:46,819 --> 01:58:49,845
What are you doing?

1604
01:58:49,922 --> 01:58:52,652
Those are her things,
Mrs. Threadgoode's things!

1605
01:58:52,725 --> 01:58:55,819
What are you doing in here?
Where's Mrs. Threadgoode? Who?

1606
01:58:55,895 --> 01:58:58,728
Mrs. Threadgoode! The woman
who lives here. Are you deaf?

1607
01:58:58,798 --> 01:59:01,699
I'm sorry, miss.
All they told me...

1608
01:59:01,767 --> 01:59:05,965
was that the woman who lived
in here died this morning.

1609
01:59:07,840 --> 01:59:09,967
Oh, my God!

1610
01:59:10,042 --> 01:59:14,376
Wha... What
are you sayin'?

1611
01:59:14,447 --> 01:59:16,608
<i>She died early
this morning.</i>

1612
01:59:16,682 --> 01:59:21,016
<i>They were shorthanded so they asked
me to take all this stuff down.</i>

1613
01:59:21,087 --> 01:59:23,578
<i>That's all I know.</i>

1614
01:59:42,975 --> 01:59:44,909
Stop that!

1615
01:59:44,977 --> 01:59:47,343
What is the matter
with you people?

1616
01:59:47,413 --> 01:59:50,348
Can't you wait a goddamn day,
for Chrissake?

1617
01:59:50,416 --> 01:59:53,408
Do you have no respect?
These are her things!

1618
01:59:53,486 --> 01:59:57,650
I'm sorry, but they told me to get
this room ready for another patient.

1619
01:59:57,723 --> 02:00:00,920
She may be just
another patient to you,

1620
02:00:00,993 --> 02:00:05,089
but she was my friend,
and I loved her. I'm sorry.

1621
02:00:05,164 --> 02:00:07,098
I'm just
following orders.

1622
02:00:07,166 --> 02:00:10,101
What is going on? Why
didn't you call me?

1623
02:00:10,169 --> 02:00:13,502
You could've called me before
you sent that idiot... I'm sorry.

1624
02:00:13,573 --> 02:00:16,235
It never occurred to me that
you would take it this hard.

1625
02:00:16,309 --> 02:00:19,938
I didn't even get to tell
her good-bye. Oh, I know.

1626
02:00:20,012 --> 02:00:23,971
These things are difficult, but
she died peacefully in her sleep.

1627
02:00:24,050 --> 02:00:27,315
To tell you the truth, I thought
you'd be happy for Mrs. Threadgoode.

1628
02:00:27,386 --> 02:00:30,412
Happy? Why, yes! This
is what she wanted.

1629
02:00:30,489 --> 02:00:32,423
What?
To be dead?

1630
02:00:32,491 --> 02:00:35,016
No, to go home.
You just missed her.

1631
02:00:35,094 --> 02:00:37,528
She left in a yellow cab
about a half hour ago.

1632
02:00:37,597 --> 02:00:40,293
I don't understand.
What? A cab?

1633
02:00:40,366 --> 02:00:44,632
She said there wasn't no reason for
her to stay now that Mrs. Otis had died.

1634
02:00:44,704 --> 02:00:47,332
Mrs...

1635
02:00:47,406 --> 02:00:49,567
Otis is dead?

1636
02:00:49,642 --> 02:00:53,510
Oh, Mrs. Otis died.

1637
02:00:53,579 --> 02:00:55,570
Mrs. Otis died!

1638
02:00:55,648 --> 02:00:58,845
Mrs. Otis!
Oh, God!

1639
02:00:58,918 --> 02:01:02,945
Not that... I'm glad that
Mrs. Otis died, it's just...

1640
02:01:03,022 --> 02:01:05,650
Oh, God,
I've gotta stop her.

1641
02:01:45,097 --> 02:01:48,328
Hey, Evelyn,
somebody stole my house.

1642
02:01:48,401 --> 02:01:51,302
It was right here
when I left.

1643
02:01:51,370 --> 02:01:56,137
Unless... Oh, Evelyn, you
don't reckon I'm crazy, do you?

1644
02:01:56,208 --> 02:02:00,406
It was here when I left.
No, honey, you're not crazy.

1645
02:02:00,479 --> 02:02:03,243
This is the place.

1646
02:02:03,316 --> 02:02:07,343
Why would anyone want to
steal an old lady's home?

1647
02:02:07,420 --> 02:02:09,547
Wasn't worth nothin'.

1648
02:02:09,622 --> 02:02:13,023
Oh, honey,
nobody stole it.

1649
02:02:13,092 --> 02:02:16,960
They had to tear it down.
It was condemned.

1650
02:02:17,029 --> 02:02:19,156
I'm sorry.
I shoulda told you.

1651
02:02:19,231 --> 02:02:22,496
Well, somebody
shoulda told me.

1652
02:02:22,568 --> 02:02:27,403
I'm old. I'm not a child. I'm sorry.

1653
02:02:27,473 --> 02:02:30,806
My husband Cleo and I
lived in this house...

1654
02:02:30,876 --> 02:02:33,367
for more than 40 years.

1655
02:02:33,446 --> 02:02:36,847
Now, it's... it's gone.

1656
02:02:36,916 --> 02:02:40,477
83 years worth of livin'
and all that's left of me...

1657
02:02:40,553 --> 02:02:44,580
is what's in this box, a
bunch of old cards and pictures.

1658
02:02:44,657 --> 02:02:47,125
Come on.
I'll take you home.

1659
02:02:47,193 --> 02:02:49,320
This is my home!

1660
02:02:49,395 --> 02:02:51,386
And now it's gone.

1661
02:02:51,464 --> 02:02:53,989
And Mrs. Otis
is gone.

1662
02:02:54,066 --> 02:02:56,159
I...

1663
02:02:56,235 --> 02:02:58,829
I don't quite
know what to do.

1664
02:02:58,904 --> 02:03:02,738
This is the first time I can remember
when I don't have a soul to look after.

1665
02:03:02,808 --> 02:03:05,174
You can come
look after me and Ed.

1666
02:03:05,244 --> 02:03:07,542
Oh, you're sweet,

1667
02:03:07,613 --> 02:03:10,411
but I think you're doin'
just fine on your own.

1668
02:03:10,483 --> 02:03:14,783
Don't you know you'd be
like a gift for us?

1669
02:03:14,854 --> 02:03:18,017
You're the reason
I get up every morning...

1670
02:03:18,090 --> 02:03:21,423
and that Mary Kay's
havin' such a good year...

1671
02:03:21,494 --> 02:03:26,056
and I don't look like some
blob from a horror movie.

1672
02:03:26,132 --> 02:03:30,159
Well, with a little help
from Idgie and Ruth.

1673
02:03:31,737 --> 02:03:34,262
Come on. I've got
your room all ready.

1674
02:03:34,340 --> 02:03:36,740
What does Ed say
about all this?

1675
02:03:36,809 --> 02:03:40,643
He'll learn
to love it.

1676
02:03:44,116 --> 02:03:48,246
Did I ever tell you that Mrs.
Otis was Sipsey's baby sister?

1677
02:03:48,320 --> 02:03:50,982
No, ma'am.
Yes, she was.

1678
02:03:51,056 --> 02:03:54,924
Mrs. Otis was with Sipsey
and me the night Sipsey died.

1679
02:03:54,994 --> 02:04:00,159
Sipsey told me a story that night
I've never told a living soul, Evelyn.

1680
02:04:00,232 --> 02:04:03,360
<i>A story about
what really happened...</i>

1681
02:04:03,436 --> 02:04:06,769
<i>the night Frank Bennett
disappeared.</i>

1682
02:04:39,338 --> 02:04:42,865
Hey there! You got to come quick.

1683
02:04:42,942 --> 02:04:47,902
The show has hardly begun. You
got to come quick. You hear me?

1684
02:04:53,819 --> 02:04:56,413
Run, get help! Run,
quick! Where's the baby?

1685
02:04:56,489 --> 02:04:58,286
Never mind.

1686
02:05:17,009 --> 02:05:18,670
Excuse me, sir.

1687
02:05:18,744 --> 02:05:24,239
I don't believe you should be
goin' anywhere with Ruth's baby.

1688
02:05:35,895 --> 02:05:38,625
Like I said,
you ain't goin' nowhere.

1689
02:05:38,697 --> 02:05:41,257
Damn, you a thickheaded
son-of-a-bitch, ain't you?

1690
02:05:45,471 --> 02:05:47,439
<i>I told you...</i>

1691
02:05:47,506 --> 02:05:51,943
you ain't goin' nowheres
with Miss Ruth's baby.

1692
02:05:57,583 --> 02:05:59,778
Come on, angel.
Come on.

1693
02:05:59,852 --> 02:06:03,686
Come on, sweetheart.
It's all right.

1694
02:06:03,756 --> 02:06:06,247
Come on.
It's all right, baby.

1695
02:06:09,161 --> 02:06:11,891
<i>It was self-defense.</i>

1696
02:06:11,964 --> 02:06:16,799
I don't know why any white
jury would care why I did it.

1697
02:06:16,869 --> 02:06:19,667
Well, I saw it, and I can
testify. Excuse me here.

1698
02:06:19,738 --> 02:06:21,899
I don't mean
no offense here,

1699
02:06:21,974 --> 02:06:25,034
but I don't know who's less
likely to convince a jury,

1700
02:06:25,110 --> 02:06:27,374
my mama...
or Mr. Smokey.

1701
02:06:27,446 --> 02:06:30,244
No offense taken.

1702
02:06:30,316 --> 02:06:32,716
You're a good man,
Mr. Smokey.

1703
02:06:32,785 --> 02:06:36,812
You did good.
The sun's almost up.

1704
02:06:40,359 --> 02:06:43,726
George?
Mm-hmm?

1705
02:06:43,796 --> 02:06:46,560
I think...

1706
02:06:46,632 --> 02:06:50,159
it's hog-boiling time.

1707
02:06:50,235 --> 02:06:52,499
No, ma'am. It
ain't cold enough.

1708
02:06:52,571 --> 02:06:55,335
It's hog-boiling time.

1709
02:06:58,277 --> 02:07:00,211
<i>Big George?</i>

1710
02:07:00,279 --> 02:07:03,373
Uh-huh? When is that
barbecue gonna be ready?

1711
02:07:03,449 --> 02:07:05,781
It's gonna be ready
any time now.

1712
02:07:05,851 --> 02:07:10,754
Smells so damn good I just
can't wait to get me some.

1713
02:07:10,823 --> 02:07:15,123
Now, don't you forget to call
me when that's ready. All right.

1714
02:07:28,874 --> 02:07:31,138
Here you go.

1715
02:07:32,711 --> 02:07:36,340
Miss Idgie? Smokey left town. Yeah?

1716
02:07:36,415 --> 02:07:40,408
I thought it'd be best
under the circumstances.

1717
02:07:40,486 --> 02:07:44,445
He asked that
you tell Ruth good-bye.

1718
02:07:44,523 --> 02:07:46,991
Shame he had to go.

1719
02:07:53,966 --> 02:07:58,869
<i>Hold on! I'm comin'.</i>

1720
02:08:03,742 --> 02:08:06,506
What you want?
We want some barbecue.

1721
02:08:06,578 --> 02:08:10,275
Not today you don't.
Go on.

1722
02:08:23,328 --> 02:08:26,456
Why, this is about the
best barbecue I ever ate!

1723
02:08:27,966 --> 02:08:31,458
The secret's
in the sauce.

1724
02:08:40,245 --> 02:08:44,113
Sipsey?
My God!

1725
02:08:44,183 --> 02:08:48,517
That fryin' pan did more
than fry chicken that night.

1726
02:08:50,289 --> 02:08:54,749
Did Idgie really barbecue Frank
Bennett? Are you pullin' my leg?

1727
02:08:54,827 --> 02:08:58,524
Secret's in the sauce,
or so I've been told.

1728
02:09:02,034 --> 02:09:05,868
Now you know why
Idgie had to go on trial.

1729
02:09:05,938 --> 02:09:09,567
She knew the law would never
believe Sipsey. No!

1730
02:09:09,641 --> 02:09:12,132
Sipsey or Big George
or anyone else of color...

1731
02:09:12,211 --> 02:09:15,669
would've been hangin'
from the nearest tree.

1732
02:09:15,748 --> 02:09:18,012
To this day,
I'm still not sure...

1733
02:09:18,083 --> 02:09:20,643
whether Ruth
ever believed...

1734
02:09:20,719 --> 02:09:24,849
that Idgie didn't kill
Frank Bennett.

1735
02:09:24,923 --> 02:09:29,155
Truth's a funny thing
sometimes.

1736
02:09:29,228 --> 02:09:33,187
I feel better now.
Good.

1737
02:09:33,265 --> 02:09:36,564
I feel better 'cause
all these people'll live...

1738
02:09:36,635 --> 02:09:39,695
as long as
you remember 'em.

1739
02:09:39,772 --> 02:09:41,706
You reminded me...

1740
02:09:41,774 --> 02:09:45,175
about what the most
important thing in life is.

1741
02:09:45,244 --> 02:09:47,576
Do you know what I
think it is? No, ma'am.

1742
02:09:47,646 --> 02:09:50,911
Friends.
Best friends.

1743
02:09:50,983 --> 02:09:54,009
Oh, Ninny!

1744
02:09:55,187 --> 02:09:56,916
Look.

1745
02:10:02,194 --> 02:10:04,025
Oh!

1746
02:10:23,248 --> 02:10:25,182
Idgie?

1747
02:10:28,654 --> 02:10:32,522
<i>Idgie's alive?
Oh, yes!</i>

1748
02:10:32,591 --> 02:10:36,857
She's still out and about
charmin' bees and selling honey.

1749
02:10:36,929 --> 02:10:40,888
Sometimes I think
I catch a glimpse of her.

1750
02:10:46,805 --> 02:10:49,239
Maybe we'll
see her today.

1751
02:10:49,308 --> 02:10:51,936
Maybe.

1752
02:10:53,612 --> 02:10:56,308
Let's go.

1753
02:11:07,826 --> 02:11:12,126
<i>After Ruth died and
the railroad stopped runnin',</i>

1754
02:11:12,197 --> 02:11:16,190
<i>the cafe shut down, and everybody
Just scattered to the winds.</i>

1755
02:11:17,536 --> 02:11:20,903
<i>It was never more than just
a little knockabout place.</i>

1756
02:11:20,973 --> 02:11:23,771
<i>But now that
I look back on it,</i>

1757
02:11:23,842 --> 02:11:26,106
<i>when that cafe closed...</i>

1758
02:11:26,178 --> 02:11:30,274
<i>the heart of the town
Just stopped beating.</i>

1759
02:11:30,349 --> 02:11:33,182
<i>It's funny how
a little place like this...</i>

1760
02:11:33,252 --> 02:11:37,086
<i>brought so
many people together.</i>

1761
02:12:32,277 --> 02:12:35,178
<i>I'll remember you</i>

1762
02:12:37,816 --> 02:12:42,014
<i>When I've forgotten
all the rest</i>

1763
02:12:44,690 --> 02:12:48,490
<i>You to me
were true</i>

1764
02:12:50,762 --> 02:12:54,323
<i>You to me
were the best</i>

1765
02:12:55,634 --> 02:12:58,933
<i>When there is no more</i>

1766
02:12:59,004 --> 02:13:01,802
<i>You cut to the core</i>

1767
02:13:03,241 --> 02:13:08,269
<i>Quicker than anyone
that I knew</i>

1768
02:13:08,347 --> 02:13:12,477
<i>Now when the
roses fade</i>

1769
02:13:12,551 --> 02:13:16,487
<i>I'm in the shade
baby</i>

1770
02:13:16,555 --> 02:13:19,922
<i>I'll remember you</i>

1771
02:13:19,992 --> 02:13:23,985
<i>Now listen
didn't I</i>

1772
02:13:24,062 --> 02:13:28,089
<i>Didn't I love you</i>

1773
02:13:28,166 --> 02:13:34,537
<i>Didn't I
didn't I care</i>

1774
02:13:34,606 --> 02:13:40,567
<i>Didn't I sleep
and didn't I weep beside you</i>

1775
02:13:40,645 --> 02:13:45,981
<i>With the rain that
was blowing in your hair</i>

1776
02:13:46,051 --> 02:13:48,110
<i>Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh</i>

1777
02:13:49,221 --> 02:13:52,156
<i>I'll remember you</i>

1778
02:13:53,425 --> 02:13:55,655
<i>When the wind blows</i>

1779
02:13:55,727 --> 02:13:59,823
<i>On through
the piney wood</i>

1780
02:14:01,266 --> 02:14:07,671
<i>It was you who came
right through for me, baby</i>

1781
02:14:07,739 --> 02:14:11,368
<i>It was you
who understood</i>

1782
02:14:12,511 --> 02:14:15,742
<i>Though I'd never say</i>

1783
02:14:15,814 --> 02:14:20,683
<i>That I turned the way</i>

1784
02:14:20,752 --> 02:14:25,314
<i>That you
have led me to</i>

1785
02:14:25,390 --> 02:14:29,326
<i>Darling, in the end</i>

1786
02:14:29,394 --> 02:14:33,524
<i>My dear sweet friend</i>

1787
02:14:33,598 --> 02:14:36,897
<i>I'll remember you</i>

1788
02:14:36,968 --> 02:14:40,563
<i>Yes, I will now</i>

1789
02:14:40,639 --> 02:14:43,233
<i>I'll remember you</i>

1790
02:14:43,308 --> 02:14:45,606
<i>Yes, I will now</i>

1791
02:14:47,913 --> 02:14:51,314
<i>I'll remember, remember</i>

1792
02:14:51,383 --> 02:14:53,715
<i>I'll remember</i>

1793
02:14:53,785 --> 02:14:57,050
<i>I will remember you
Yes, I will</i>

1794
02:15:04,830 --> 02:15:08,664
<i>Time ain't gonna
change nothin', baby</i>

1795
02:15:08,733 --> 02:15:11,964
<i>We can be halfway across
the world from each other</i>

1796
02:15:12,037 --> 02:15:15,268
<i>Don't make no difference</i>

1797
02:15:15,340 --> 02:15:21,671
<i>I'll remember</i>

1798
02:15:21,746 --> 02:15:24,840
<i>Every hour, every second</i>

1799
02:15:24,916 --> 02:15:28,750
<i>Every moment
that we had</i>

1800
02:15:28,820 --> 02:15:31,914
<i>We do it, we do it</i>

1801
02:15:31,990 --> 02:15:35,084
<i>We do it
don't do it</i>

1802
02:15:35,160 --> 02:15:40,188
<i>Gonna do it, do it
do it, do it, do it</i>

1803
02:15:41,533 --> 02:15:44,730
<i>I'll remember,
I'll remember</i>

1804
02:15:44,803 --> 02:15:48,000
<i>Oh, I'll remember you</i>

1805
02:15:48,073 --> 02:15:53,204
<i>I'll remember you</i>

1806
02:15:57,616 --> 02:16:00,176
<i>I'll remember you</i>

1807
02:16:00,252 --> 02:16:02,516
<i>Yes, I will</i>
