1
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:40,165
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:42,167
We want to welcome
a very special guest

3
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,335
to our park today

4
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,253
the president's daughter.

5
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:47,297
Big smile. Big smile.

6
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:48,798
Hello, Alexandra.

7
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:49,966
Where's your father?

8
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:51,801
He'll be here.

9
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,346
I'll make sure of it.

10
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,723
Well, hey there,
little miss first lady,

11
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:59,559
I'm Dinky Winks, owner
of this fine establishment.

12
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:02,437
You ready to ride the ride
and shrill to the thrills,
spills, and chills?

13
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:03,772
Yes, I am.

14
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:05,815
Right this way!

15
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,779
Of course, that behind me...
the world-famous Whippersnapper.

16
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,782
- Guaranteed to make
grown men howl

17
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,742
- Like a cub woke
at weaning time.

18
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:18,036
Over on our left...

19
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:21,790
The NerveWracker...
oh-ho, painful.

20
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:23,917
Good fun.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,669
On your other left

22
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,963
is, well,
my personal favorite

23
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,256
the Vomiter.

24
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,508
Now, we tell people

25
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,677
not to ride it
on a full stomach,

26
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,261
but you know folks.

27
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,806
They just don't listen.

28
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,600
But...

29
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:42,769
why bother with any
of those?

30
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:45,563
You're here
for my latest and greatest.

31
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:48,358
For your personal amusement
and complete gratification,

32
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:51,111
I humbly offer...

33
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:53,113
the Juggler.

34
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,786
But is it fast?

35
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,621
Is it fast?

36
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,498
Well, let's see, shall we?

37
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:07,127
The riders are strapped
into the bubble.

38
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:13,008
The hydrobot lifts the bubble
high into the air.

39
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,302
And spins it round and round
as fast

40
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:20,056
as the United States government
will allow.

41
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:27,272
The bubble spins, turns,
flips, and bounces.

42
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:31,609
And then... it juggles you.

43
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,704
I want to go on!

44
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,206
I thought so.

45
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,792
Now, understand - the override
precautions are top-notch,

46
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,753
modified by yours truly.

47
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,504
I thought her father
was supposed to be here.

48
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,798
The president
has more pressing business

49
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,175
than to spend
an entire Sunday

50
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,052
in a theme park.

51
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,346
No one's that busy.

52
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,558
Have fun, kid.

53
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,603
- We'll take it a little slow,

54
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,772
just make it fun.

55
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,242
Can't you get her down?

56
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,119
Somebody's jammed
the override.

57
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:26,164
Why, that
little troublemaker.

58
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,085
Remain calm.
Remain calm.

59
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:33,213
We are the Secret Service.
Everything is under control.

60
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,964
- There's nothing
we can do, sir.
- What?

61
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,925
The weight of our agents
will prevent us from ascending

62
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,843
the shaky precipice
on which she now stands.

63
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,679
She'll fall.

64
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:43,765
Don't we have
any smaller agents?

65
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:48,478
Bring me agents SK1 and SK2.

66
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,731
- Coming through.
- Coming through.

67
00:03:58,113 --> 00:03:59,489
We're ready.

68
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,616
Use this - the latest gear.

69
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,284
We get to keep them
afterwards?

70
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,661
- N-No.

71
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:05,745
Yes.

72
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,330
Of course.

73
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,082
Let's rock.

74
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,337
You're sure
they can handle this?

75
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:19,009
If not,
there are two others who can.

76
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:22,595
Bring me agents SK3 and SK4
as backup.

77
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,308
We got company.

78
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:35,316
Gary and Gerti...
what are they doing here?

79
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,709
Excuse me there, sport.

80
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,378
Where did you get that?

81
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,339
Latest
in electro-riser technology,

82
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,924
with new composite materials
and A.I. brainology.

83
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,217
I can see

84
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,219
you don't know
what I'm talking about.

85
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,221
Gary, this is my rescue.

86
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,890
We'll take it from here.

87
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:10,477
"Latest gear," my butt.

88
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,021
No, no, no!

89
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:15,774
You'll just make it worse!

90
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:18,610
Now you done it.

91
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,362
Over here!

92
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,571
Get away from me!

93
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,532
Alexandra, take my hand!

94
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:25,784
Back off!

95
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,286
I want my father
to come up here and get me.

96
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,538
But he's the president
of the United States.

97
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:31,790
No, he's my father.

98
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,417
He was my father
before he ever became president,

99
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,544
and he should still
be my father now.

100
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,254
I want him up here!

101
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,923
Sir, we have a situation.

102
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:41,591
She's got the Transmooker.

103
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,968
This is now
a code-red situation.

104
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,178
Get her down now!

105
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,262
The point is,

106
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,807
you and your father
need to have a talk.

107
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,850
Up here may not be
the best place.

108
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:52,936
Come with me,
and I promise you,

109
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,397
- The two of you will have
that talk.

110
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,066
How can you promise that?

111
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,734
I'm Level 2.

112
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:02,779
I can order him
to talk to you.

113
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:08,910
Hi, Gerti.

114
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,620
Whatcha doing?

115
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:11,996
I'm trying to stop the ride.

116
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,624
- Without disengaging
the axis?
- Exactly.

117
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,626
Then stop what you're doing.

118
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:20,088
You see, the ride
is designed to work
like a giant magnet.

119
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,756
If you reverse
the polarization,

120
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,218
bye-bye,
president's daughter.

121
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,892
See you around.

122
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,188
- Okay.

123
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:38,481
Wait.

124
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:41,026
I took this from
my father's office this morning.

125
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,819
I'm sure he'll want it back.

126
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,030
Careful!

127
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,574
Look, Cortez, you take her down,
and I'll take this down.

128
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,075
That way, we both look good.

129
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:52,328
I'm not doing this
for looks, Gary.

130
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,211
Thank goodness
you're all right, Alexandra.

131
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,671
We were worried sick.

132
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,882
- Boys.

133
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:08,261
I think this
is what you're looking for.

134
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,931
She swiped it
from the president.

135
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:14,476
Oh, you're in big trouble
this time, missy.

136
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:16,853
Wait a minute.

137
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,855
I promised her
she could talk to her father.

138
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,857
Oh, she'll talk to him,
all right.

139
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,485
We'll make sure of that.

140
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:25,630
So, you want
the Ukata assignment, huh?

141
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:28,466
Your duties are assigned
to you by the agency

142
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,343
same as everyone,
same as me.

143
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:33,096
I know. It's just
that we've learned so much.

144
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,849
Juni and I are more
than capable of taking
bigger assignments.

145
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,392
But that's not
your decision to make.

146
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,060
The Spy Kids organization
is still new,

147
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:40,854
and if you're a Level 3
or even a Level 2,

148
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,565
you cannot
go on a mission alone.

149
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:46,234
You need more experience.

150
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:47,819
Come on.

151
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:50,155
Okay, Mom, if you're looking
for top-secret information,

152
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,656
just go straight
to the source.

153
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:54,242
Welcome to the Pentagon.

154
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:57,120
How did you do that?
You can't do that.

155
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,538
There is no hacking
in this household.

156
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,081
I know. Sorry.

157
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:03,168
Show me that again.

158
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:10,800
I know this hair thing
is one of my weakest points.

159
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:12,218
- Wait one minute.

160
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:15,096
You're gonna look cool.

161
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,641
In fact, you're looking cooler,
right? Like me.

162
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,477
Like Poppy.

163
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:24,689
And it's kind
of em-o-tion-al to me.

164
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,358
You know? Uh-oh.

165
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:27,901
A knot.

166
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,903
We are gonna...

167
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:31,863
You...

168
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,115
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
We got it.

169
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:35,867
That's my boy.

170
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,410
Last touch.

171
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:39,454
Hup, hup.

172
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,664
You want me
to tie it for you?

173
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:45,043
No, it's okay.
R.A.L.P.H. can do it.

174
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,214
Bow tie, R.A.L.P.H.,

175
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,466
and not too tight.

176
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:05,397
Thanks, R.A.L.P.H.

177
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:09,484
Interesting.

178
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,527
But...

179
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,948
he can never, ever
replace...

180
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,616
me.

181
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:17,826
Pow.

182
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:18,910
Not yet, but I think

183
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:22,288
that new upgrade
comes in next week.

184
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:28,378
Only joking.

185
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,171
Hey!

186
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,009
Kids. Kids. Kids. Kids.

187
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,177
Ki

188
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:38,555
Joking?

189
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,057
Thank you.

190
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,392
Yes, ma'am.

191
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:43,643
Okay. Remember, kids,

192
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:46,354
this is a very important night
for your father.

193
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:49,107
And if he's named director
of the O.S.S.,

194
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,568
be sure to stand up
and give him a big hug,

195
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,944
all right?

196
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:55,113
What if Dad doesn't win?

197
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:58,366
Well, then,
give him a bigger hug.

198
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,997
Oh, Yao Ling, Wa Ling,

199
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,999
this is Danielle
and Dione Daluc.

200
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,334
- Hello.
- Hi.

201
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:10,712
They created lnfolink, sort of
an online trading system

202
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:14,007
for swapping
international secrets.

203
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:17,510
Hi.

204
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,137
Oh, hey.

205
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,513
Hello.

206
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:21,431
Champagne?

207
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,599
Can't have any of that.

208
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,309
Sorry.

209
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:29,314
Something doesn't feel right.

210
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,066
No wonder...
your buddy's here

211
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,859
your buddy
with the weird laugh.

212
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:34,110
He does not have
a weird laugh.

213
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:37,489
We were just...
talking about you.

214
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,990
Really?

215
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,827
Wow.
You look great, Carmen.

216
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:45,246
- You want to dance?
- Sure.

217
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,707
I don't think that's
a good idea, Gary.

218
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,460
Family rules say you need to
ask my father's permission.

219
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,254
You know, you should have had
that suit tailored, Juni.

220
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,006
It's bunching up
around your gut,

221
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,841
and it makes your head
look way too big.

222
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,719
You have to excuse
my little brother.

223
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:03,014
He's still a little upset
about the... Juggler incident.

224
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:06,184
A good agent
controls his temper.

225
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,688
Just be glad
my dad isn't here.

226
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,981
He gets really psycho
about this sort of thing.

227
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:14,943
Hi, Dad.

228
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,028
Um, you remember Gary.
He's in our organization.

229
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:19,489
I was just asking your daughter
for a dance.

230
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:21,074
You know how to dance?

231
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,158
Fairly well, sir.

232
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,368
What kind of dances?

233
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,619
All types of dances.

234
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,037
- What about tango?
- Yes.

235
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:27,247
- Mambo?
- Fairly well.

236
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,456
- Rumba?
- Yes.

237
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,624
- Cha-cha-cha?
- Seven steps.

238
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:30,709
- Bossa nova?
- Mm-hmm.

239
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:33,336
- Merengue?
- Of course.

240
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,550
What about waltz?

241
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:41,594
Y-Yeah, I can waltz.

242
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,221
Show me.

243
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:47,600
Right.

244
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:56,735
Something like that.

245
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,612
All right.

246
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:01,948
You can go to dance.

247
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:08,788
Watch your older sister.

248
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:31,102
Alexandra?

249
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:32,103
Yes?

250
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:33,813
What are you doing in there?

251
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:35,607
Dancing.

252
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,526
Do you always carry
this many Secret Service around?

253
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,445
My dad's idea

254
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:43,907
he's gotten
a little... paranoid.

255
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:48,453
Well, would you dance...
with me?

256
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:49,788
No.

257
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:53,249
All right,
hold on a second, guys.

258
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,752
Level 2 - break it up!

259
00:13:57,796 --> 00:13:59,506
Why not?

260
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,593
I only dance...

261
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:05,095
ballet.

262
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:10,433
What
an incredible coincidence.

263
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,853
So do l.

264
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:45,010
Well, Juni, I must say,

265
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:47,929
you're a man
of many talents.

266
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:54,185
One tries.

267
00:14:56,896 --> 00:15:01,192
Uh, could you find your seats?
We're ready to start.

268
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,488
I must go.

269
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:12,704
- Ladies and gentlemen,

270
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:15,999
the president
of the United States.

271
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:21,171
Thank you.

272
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,799
I am proud of the O.S.S.

273
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:27,052
and their newly formed
Spy Kids division.

274
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,888
For their outstanding
accomplishments yesterday.

275
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:32,140
Gary and Gerti Giggles

276
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:33,683
not only saved
my daughter...

277
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:36,436
What is he talking about?
I saved her!

278
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:37,729
Juni...

279
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:41,274
But more importantly,
if not most importantly,

280
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:44,611
they safely retrieved
the Transmooker device

281
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:47,238
that my daughter accidentally
took from my office

282
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:49,407
earlier that day.

283
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,910
Now it is my great pleasure
to announce

284
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:55,038
the new director
of the O.S.S...

285
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:58,083
Gregor

286
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:04,047
... Donnagon Giggles.

287
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:14,641
Gary and Gerti Giggles

288
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:16,184
are the kind of agents
we need

289
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:18,770
to turn the O.S.S. around.

290
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:21,147
I am proud to award them

291
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:24,984
- These Level 1 badges,

292
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:29,280
- What?
- Which will enable them
to take on real missions,

293
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:32,158
something challenging,
like the Ukata assignment.

294
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:33,660
Yes!

295
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:37,038
- I wanted that assignment.
This is so unfair.

296
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:39,416
I am proud to claim them

297
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,794
as our organization's
top Spy Kid operatives!

298
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:44,170
Something's not right.

299
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:45,505
And I'm also proud

300
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:48,508
to claim them, of course,

301
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,552
as my children.

302
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:51,845
This is all wrong.

303
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:54,097
To our Spy Kids.

304
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,890
- To our Spy Kids.
- To our Spy Kids.
- To our Spy Kids.

305
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,976
To our Spy Kids.

306
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,073
This...

307
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,712
Secure the perimeter!

308
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:27,422
Sleepers.

309
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:31,259
They're after
the Transmooker device!

310
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:50,278
Take'em down.

311
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:00,747
- Pull!
- Pull!

312
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:54,884
Get off, squirt.

313
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:01,558
Give me that back!

314
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:26,184
- You all right, sir?
- Yeah.

315
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:30,146
Come here!

316
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,565
Juni, get off of him!

317
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:39,948
No, no. They took
the Transmooker device!

318
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:43,118
They took
the Transmooker device!

319
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:09,561
- The following
Spy Kid cadets

320
00:21:09,644 --> 00:21:12,272
please report to the psychic
abilities seminar

321
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:15,525
- Mike Cardenas
and Daniel Duluth.

322
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:20,447
- It's my turn, too.
- Are you sure?

323
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:23,366
All right, your last name is?

324
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:29,205
Hold on a second.

325
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:31,207
I had the Transmooker
in my hand,

326
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:32,375
but you know Juni

327
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:34,419
he wanted to claim it
for himself.

328
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:36,963
- Okay, that should do it.
Thank you, son.
- Right.

329
00:21:37,047 --> 00:21:40,842
If that Transmooker device
falls into the wrong hands...

330
00:21:40,884 --> 00:21:42,385
we're doomed.

331
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:44,721
Thank you, Mr. President.
That'll be all.

332
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:46,264
We're doomed!

333
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:48,475
Understood, sir.

334
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:11,581
Here.

335
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,431
"Floop's Fooglie"...

336
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:31,434
Starring Minion...

337
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:33,895
and Carmenita...

338
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:40,193
Thanks.

339
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:51,830
I was fired.

340
00:22:51,913 --> 00:22:53,206
I know.

341
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:55,792
I hacked
into the O.S.S. data files

342
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,877
and saw the news.

343
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,088
It was probably my fault,
I suppose.

344
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:02,340
I'm sorry.

345
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:04,634
Well, I guess that's that.

346
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:08,388
Let's go to the tree house.
I got an idea.

347
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:12,308
I guess
I could always set up

348
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:15,770
a small detective agency
out here or something.

349
00:23:15,854 --> 00:23:18,148
You're thinking
small again, Juni.

350
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:20,483
The old tree house

351
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:23,069
needs another helicopter pad.

352
00:23:23,153 --> 00:23:26,614
It needs a paint job,
is what it needs.

353
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:37,334
Your name?

354
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:40,628
Carmen Elizabeth Juanita
Echo Sky Brava Cortez.

355
00:23:40,712 --> 00:23:42,130
- Your name?

356
00:23:42,213 --> 00:23:45,300
Juni Rocket Racer
Rebelde Cortez.

357
00:23:53,725 --> 00:23:54,934
You know...

358
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:57,771
I'm kind of looking forward
to retirement,

359
00:23:57,854 --> 00:24:02,400
get back to all the projects
and dreams I left behind.

360
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:04,986
Oh, stop it, Juni.

361
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:10,617
Look, do you want
your job back or not?

362
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,994
That's right...
reinstated Level 2.

363
00:24:13,078 --> 00:24:16,039
So now we can get back
the missing Transmooker.

364
00:24:16,081 --> 00:24:17,374
How?

365
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:32,681
Looks like Gary and Gerti
are about to get briefed

366
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:34,182
on the Ukata assignment.

367
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:36,559
We should listen in.

368
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:40,397
Is R.A.L.P.H. still
at your office?

369
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,692
If they haven't
cleaned it out yet.

370
00:24:53,618 --> 00:24:56,246
R.A.L.P.H.,
get to the briefing room.

371
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:59,791
We need you to spy
on Gary and Gerti.

372
00:24:59,874 --> 00:25:02,544
Make sure no one sees you.

373
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:44,169
- There is
a Bermuda Triangle of sorts

374
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:45,545
off the coast
of Madagascar.

375
00:25:45,545 --> 00:25:47,380
As you may remember,
this is an area

376
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:50,633
where some of our O.S.S. cargo
ships have been disappearing.

377
00:25:50,717 --> 00:25:52,010
Good boy, R.A.L.P.H.

378
00:25:52,093 --> 00:25:53,636
The survivors
of these disappearances

379
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,348
tell delusional tales

380
00:25:56,431 --> 00:25:59,601
of a mysterious island
populated by strange creatures.

381
00:25:59,684 --> 00:26:03,229
Obviously, no land mass
is located anywhere near there,

382
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:06,524
- So these tales were
dismissed, and the agents fired.

383
00:26:06,608 --> 00:26:07,942
However...

384
00:26:08,026 --> 00:26:10,653
the magnet ship that captured
the Transmooker device

385
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:14,616
was last seen
in this same area.

386
00:26:14,699 --> 00:26:16,534
So, we need a small ship,

387
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:18,828
piloted by two small agents

388
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:20,789
to go in and take
a closer look.

389
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:23,792
If you find anything
out of the ordinary,

390
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:25,460
you return,

391
00:26:25,543 --> 00:26:27,337
you report it back here.

392
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,713
- We accept.
- We accept.

393
00:26:28,797 --> 00:26:30,006
You bet we accept.

394
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,843
Come home, R.A.L.P.H.
Good work.

395
00:26:34,135 --> 00:26:35,595
It's a great assignment,

396
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,473
but Gary and Gerti have it,
and I'm fired.

397
00:26:38,515 --> 00:26:40,850
And I'm reassigning you
to the O.S.S.

398
00:26:40,934 --> 00:26:43,478
- Don't tell me
you're hacking into
- Already done.

399
00:26:44,604 --> 00:26:45,563
Level 2 status

400
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:48,108
reinstated.

401
00:26:48,191 --> 00:26:49,734
Carmen, you can't do this.

402
00:26:49,818 --> 00:26:52,821
I already did it.
I'd take it one step further.

403
00:26:52,904 --> 00:26:55,115
We're assigning ourselves
to the Ukata assignment.

404
00:26:55,156 --> 00:26:58,368
I'm programming a new
destination for Gary and Gerti.

405
00:26:58,451 --> 00:27:01,538
Now, that,
I got to be a part of.

406
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:07,502
State your name, please.

407
00:27:07,585 --> 00:27:09,671
Gary Giggles.

408
00:27:09,754 --> 00:27:11,548
Access denied.

409
00:27:11,631 --> 00:27:14,175
It knows you're not him.

410
00:27:15,427 --> 00:27:17,095
Confirmed.

411
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:20,682
New destination?

412
00:27:20,765 --> 00:27:22,559
How about...

413
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,436
Gobi Desert?

414
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:25,562
Stop it, Juni.

415
00:27:25,562 --> 00:27:26,896
What?

416
00:27:26,938 --> 00:27:29,274
Don't want your boyfriend
to go so far away?

417
00:27:29,357 --> 00:27:30,358
He's not my boyfriend.

418
00:27:30,442 --> 00:27:31,943
Okay, then.

419
00:27:32,027 --> 00:27:33,445
Destination confirmed.

420
00:27:33,528 --> 00:27:35,155
There.
What did we just do again?

421
00:27:35,238 --> 00:27:37,073
We're gonna get
the Transmooker device back

422
00:27:37,157 --> 00:27:38,742
so we can clear your name.

423
00:27:38,825 --> 00:27:40,243
We just have to solve
the case

424
00:27:40,285 --> 00:27:42,245
before anybody finds out
what we're up to.

425
00:27:42,287 --> 00:27:44,748
Are you with me?

426
00:27:44,831 --> 00:27:46,166
Okay.

427
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:48,084
Then let's go.

428
00:27:55,467 --> 00:27:57,927
- Hello?

429
00:28:00,013 --> 00:28:03,099
Hello?

430
00:28:03,183 --> 00:28:04,893
- Hey, what are you doing
up there?

431
00:28:04,976 --> 00:28:06,770
Sorry, we thought
you were somebody else.

432
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:07,812
Who gave you a key?

433
00:28:07,896 --> 00:28:11,441
Did you forget
who built you this place?

434
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,986
Come down from there.

435
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:22,660
I brought you
all-new gadgets.

436
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:25,330
Check it out...
the very latest spy watch

437
00:28:25,372 --> 00:28:26,748
total communication center,

438
00:28:26,831 --> 00:28:28,291
right there on your wrist.

439
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:30,919
Cellphone, lnternet access,
satellite TV

440
00:28:31,002 --> 00:28:32,545
you name it.

441
00:28:32,587 --> 00:28:34,547
That baby will do
everything but tell
you what time it is.

442
00:28:34,631 --> 00:28:36,132
It doesn't tell time?

443
00:28:36,174 --> 00:28:38,635
No, there was so much
stuffed into it,

444
00:28:38,718 --> 00:28:40,428
there was no more room
for the clock.

445
00:28:40,512 --> 00:28:41,846
Cool.

446
00:28:41,888 --> 00:28:43,181
Are you sure these are new?

447
00:28:43,264 --> 00:28:45,100
We can't be running around
with outdated equipment.

448
00:28:45,183 --> 00:28:47,477
Close your eyes
and hold out your wrist.

449
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:49,145
I'm gonna give you

450
00:28:49,229 --> 00:28:52,482
the one gadget
you should always carry.

451
00:28:52,524 --> 00:28:54,526
A rubber band?

452
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:56,569
No, it's
a Machete elastic wonder.

453
00:28:56,653 --> 00:28:58,238
- It's a rubber band.

454
00:28:58,321 --> 00:29:01,074
Yeah, but it's also
the world's greatest gadget

455
00:29:01,157 --> 00:29:03,576
999 uses...

456
00:29:03,618 --> 00:29:04,994
and the important thing

457
00:29:05,078 --> 00:29:08,540
is you have to figure out
what those uses are... with this.

458
00:29:08,623 --> 00:29:09,749
He's right.

459
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:12,377
Use number one...
a stylish bracelet.

460
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:14,504
Use number two...

461
00:29:17,132 --> 00:29:20,427
I'm gonna make a fortune
with these.

462
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:29,978
Are you sure
this is going to work?

463
00:29:30,061 --> 00:29:31,312
Just be cool.

464
00:29:31,354 --> 00:29:34,858
As far as anybody knows,
you're back on the force.

465
00:29:34,941 --> 00:29:37,027
Hey, Uncle Felix.

466
00:29:37,986 --> 00:29:39,946
I'm not your uncle.

467
00:29:39,988 --> 00:29:41,781
I know. It's just easier
to call you that.

468
00:29:41,865 --> 00:29:43,867
Um, you don't mind, do you?

469
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,910
Of course not.

470
00:29:47,203 --> 00:29:48,913
Well, welcome back, Juni.

471
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:50,999
Says here
you were reinstated.

472
00:29:51,082 --> 00:29:53,043
Sure does, doesn't it?

473
00:29:53,084 --> 00:29:55,045
He was fired and rehired
all in the same day.

474
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:56,296
Okay.

475
00:29:56,338 --> 00:30:00,300
Let me bring up the keys
to the DragonSpy Five.

476
00:30:00,884 --> 00:30:02,635
Cake.

477
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:04,387
6 o'clock.

478
00:30:08,308 --> 00:30:10,977
Wow. You're looking good
with the new gear, Carmen.

479
00:30:11,061 --> 00:30:13,813
- Their latest stuff.
- Very cool...

480
00:30:13,897 --> 00:30:15,815
only we had that weeks ago.

481
00:30:15,857 --> 00:30:17,984
Here's what's really new.

482
00:30:18,068 --> 00:30:19,569
Nanotechnology

483
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:23,948
everything you're wearing
is right here on my wrist.

484
00:30:24,032 --> 00:30:27,118
It's superaccurate
and, so light.

485
00:30:27,494 --> 00:30:28,953
It even tells time.

486
00:30:29,037 --> 00:30:30,580
How did you get that?

487
00:30:30,663 --> 00:30:31,956
Well, it's all prototype,
Juni.

488
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,167
You can't be running
around with those
mass-produced gadgets.

489
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:35,585
Just means
everyone's got them.

490
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:37,671
I always go
with the prototype.

491
00:30:37,754 --> 00:30:39,714
- Sure,
they're a little... buggy,

492
00:30:39,756 --> 00:30:41,174
But I can deal.

493
00:30:41,216 --> 00:30:44,094
I-I accidentally
squashed him

494
00:30:44,177 --> 00:30:46,179
on my way
out of the O.S.S. building.

495
00:30:47,263 --> 00:30:48,598
Sorry about that.

496
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,059
He was outdated, anyway,

497
00:30:51,101 --> 00:30:54,270
so think of it
as a mercy killing.

498
00:30:56,606 --> 00:30:58,108
Gary and Gerti Giggles,

499
00:30:58,149 --> 00:31:00,902
- You have assignment
SElKJu9.

500
00:31:00,985 --> 00:31:02,654
Good luck.

501
00:31:03,571 --> 00:31:06,324
Don't hurt yourselves
with that outdated gear.

502
00:31:06,408 --> 00:31:10,578
Remember, an agent
is only as good as his gadgets.

503
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:12,539
What?

504
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,708
You have
the Ukata assignment?

505
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:16,960
Very nice.

506
00:31:17,043 --> 00:31:19,004
You'll love it.

507
00:31:22,716 --> 00:31:25,010
Thanks, Uncle Felix.

508
00:31:25,927 --> 00:31:28,847
I'm not your uncle.

509
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:37,355
Oh, nice sub.

510
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:41,026
Welcome
to the DragonSpy DLX...

511
00:31:41,109 --> 00:31:43,570
Seems like they get
more and more sophisticated

512
00:31:43,611 --> 00:31:44,946
each month.

513
00:31:44,988 --> 00:31:47,073
Everything is automated!

514
00:31:47,157 --> 00:31:49,701
- Now picking your nose.

515
00:31:52,287 --> 00:31:54,622
Ugh, little brothers.

516
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:04,632
Let's check our lunchboxes
for mission updates.

517
00:32:19,898 --> 00:32:21,733
Sorry, R.A.L.P.H.

518
00:32:21,816 --> 00:32:24,903
- You were the best spy
on the force.

519
00:32:24,986 --> 00:32:27,572
Juni, leave it alone.
He's dead.

520
00:32:27,614 --> 00:32:29,616
Thanks to your buddy Gary.

521
00:32:29,657 --> 00:32:30,992
It was an accident.

522
00:32:31,076 --> 00:32:33,912
You like him and believe him?

523
00:32:34,371 --> 00:32:37,290
I don't like him...
that much.

524
00:32:44,506 --> 00:32:47,133
Gary's a bad guy, Carmen.

525
00:32:47,175 --> 00:32:49,344
Maybe I know that.

526
00:32:49,344 --> 00:32:51,262
I think I can change him.

527
00:32:51,346 --> 00:32:54,057
I do not understand you.

528
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,059
And you never will.

529
00:32:56,142 --> 00:32:58,103
- French fry, sir?

530
00:32:58,186 --> 00:33:00,021
Uh! Ow!

531
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:01,773
Gimme that!

532
00:33:05,902 --> 00:33:10,073
- Strange - tales
of a mysterious island,

533
00:33:10,156 --> 00:33:12,867
disappearing ships,
mysterious creatures,

534
00:33:12,951 --> 00:33:15,161
and yet,
no information anywhere

535
00:33:15,245 --> 00:33:17,288
on the O.S.S. cargo
or the magnet ship.

536
00:33:17,372 --> 00:33:19,457
What's Donnagon doing there?

537
00:33:19,541 --> 00:33:21,626
He wasn't
O.S.S. director yet.

538
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,962
These are old O.S.S. secrets.

539
00:33:24,004 --> 00:33:28,174
And I know just the person
we can call for advice.

540
00:33:29,342 --> 00:33:30,844
Who?

541
00:33:30,969 --> 00:33:33,221
# Who? #

542
00:33:33,263 --> 00:33:35,223
# What? #

543
00:33:35,306 --> 00:33:37,475
# When? #

544
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:39,644
# Where? #

545
00:33:39,728 --> 00:33:41,229
- # Who? #
- # What? #
- # When? #

546
00:33:41,312 --> 00:33:42,647
- # Where? #
- # And why? #

547
00:33:42,731 --> 00:33:43,898
# I delight in #

548
00:33:43,982 --> 00:33:46,818
- # What... #
- # Do I intend to find? #
- # Find #

549
00:33:46,901 --> 00:33:48,236
# This time? #

550
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:49,279
- # Run around! #
- # Jumping down! #

551
00:33:49,362 --> 00:33:50,613
# Bounce and bound and... #

552
00:33:50,697 --> 00:33:51,906
# Find another way
to duck and hide #

553
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:52,949
# This isle of... #

554
00:33:52,991 --> 00:33:55,285
# Dreams #

555
00:34:00,623 --> 00:34:02,250
Hello?

556
00:34:02,334 --> 00:34:03,626
Yes.

557
00:34:03,668 --> 00:34:06,004
- One moment, please.

558
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:09,007
Cut!

559
00:34:13,928 --> 00:34:16,389
Who is it again?

560
00:34:17,891 --> 00:34:21,269
- Juni Cortez!

561
00:34:21,311 --> 00:34:23,063
- What can I do for you?

562
00:34:23,146 --> 00:34:25,315
I mean,
you've done so much for me.

563
00:34:25,398 --> 00:34:26,775
Your robot counterparts

564
00:34:26,858 --> 00:34:29,194
are the surprise
hit characters of my show!

565
00:34:29,277 --> 00:34:30,945
Say hello.

566
00:34:31,029 --> 00:34:33,490
- # Hello #
- # Hello #

567
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:37,035
Actually, Carmen wants
a word with Mr. Minion.

568
00:34:37,118 --> 00:34:39,496
Oh. He's right here.

569
00:34:46,002 --> 00:34:48,129
Minion is practicing
a 4-part harmony.

570
00:34:48,213 --> 00:34:51,007
- You have one minute.

571
00:34:55,303 --> 00:34:56,596
Bueno?

572
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,348
How you doing, Minion?

573
00:34:58,431 --> 00:35:01,142
Things are a little Floopy
around here for my taste,

574
00:35:01,184 --> 00:35:03,228
but it's a living.

575
00:35:03,311 --> 00:35:05,730
I need some information
on your favorite subject

576
00:35:05,814 --> 00:35:07,065
the O.S.S.

577
00:35:07,148 --> 00:35:08,400
I need to make a call.

578
00:35:08,441 --> 00:35:11,236
Okay, you ready?

579
00:35:11,277 --> 00:35:12,654
Ukata...

580
00:35:12,696 --> 00:35:14,739
Transmooker...

581
00:35:14,823 --> 00:35:16,658
- The president's
daughter is unavailable.

582
00:35:16,741 --> 00:35:17,701
Manage.

583
00:35:17,742 --> 00:35:18,993
Press "1" to record.

584
00:35:19,077 --> 00:35:20,453
- Mean anything to you?

585
00:35:20,495 --> 00:35:24,082
Smells like the work
of Donnagon Giggles.

586
00:35:24,958 --> 00:35:26,918
He had first contact
with the Transmooker technology.

587
00:35:27,002 --> 00:35:29,129
You think Donnagon's the one
behind all this?

588
00:35:29,212 --> 00:35:31,297
You're talking
to a man with four heads.

589
00:35:31,381 --> 00:35:32,924
Trust me...
the guy is dirt.

590
00:35:32,966 --> 00:35:34,509
What should we look for?

591
00:35:34,592 --> 00:35:36,803
First, find the island.

592
00:35:36,845 --> 00:35:39,264
Then find the Island Man.

593
00:35:39,347 --> 00:35:41,224
That would have been
Donnagon's contact.

594
00:35:41,307 --> 00:35:42,267
Okay.

595
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:43,560
Thanks, Minion.

596
00:35:43,643 --> 00:35:45,770
Be a good girl
and swat your brother for me.

597
00:35:45,854 --> 00:35:47,564
Oh, I will.

598
00:35:50,025 --> 00:35:51,651
Something's wrong!
Take the wheel!

599
00:35:51,735 --> 00:35:53,695
Got to go.
Good luck!

600
00:35:53,737 --> 00:35:56,239
Slow down! We're nearing
destination zone.

601
00:35:56,322 --> 00:35:58,908
The radius where all
the disappearances occurred
is right...

602
00:35:59,951 --> 00:36:01,286
Here!

603
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,750
We've been shut down!

604
00:36:06,791 --> 00:36:09,794
- Hold onto something!

605
00:36:20,722 --> 00:36:24,559
All power is off...
even the emergency power.

606
00:36:25,852 --> 00:36:27,979
My flashlight
doesn't even work.

607
00:36:28,063 --> 00:36:30,523
We're stuck, aren't we?

608
00:36:31,733 --> 00:36:34,152
Let's get out of here.

609
00:36:35,111 --> 00:36:37,489
Rebreathers.

610
00:36:37,572 --> 00:36:39,366
Rebreathers.

611
00:36:39,366 --> 00:36:41,201
You got to do it by hand.

612
00:36:41,242 --> 00:36:42,911
What next?

613
00:36:44,662 --> 00:36:47,290
- Nope. Hand, Carmen.

614
00:36:51,544 --> 00:36:53,254
Unbelievable.

615
00:36:53,296 --> 00:36:55,507
Low-tech!

616
00:37:02,138 --> 00:37:03,848
Here we go.

617
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:32,711
Should we travel light
or heavy?

618
00:37:32,711 --> 00:37:34,671
We may not be coming
back down here.

619
00:37:34,713 --> 00:37:37,090
Let's go heavy.

620
00:37:37,173 --> 00:37:39,217
Inflate-a-suits?

621
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,970
We don't have much choice.

622
00:37:45,473 --> 00:37:48,018
At least the masks work.

623
00:37:48,309 --> 00:37:51,813
I think it's because
they're valve-operated,
not electrical-based.

624
00:37:51,896 --> 00:37:53,314
It's so strange.

625
00:37:53,398 --> 00:37:55,275
Good luck.

626
00:37:55,358 --> 00:37:56,901
You too!

627
00:37:56,901 --> 00:37:58,737
Stay close!

628
00:38:19,883 --> 00:38:22,510
Ugh. great.

629
00:38:22,552 --> 00:38:23,970
I'm fat!

630
00:38:24,054 --> 00:38:25,680
Was it supposed to do this?

631
00:38:25,764 --> 00:38:28,058
It has an electrical
automatic shutoff

632
00:38:28,099 --> 00:38:29,559
which didn't work.

633
00:38:29,642 --> 00:38:32,854
Luckily, we ran out of air
before the suits exploded.

634
00:38:32,937 --> 00:38:35,774
Well, we can still laugh.

635
00:38:35,857 --> 00:38:37,609
At what?

636
00:38:37,692 --> 00:38:41,321
At whatever you can imagine
Gary and Gerti are doing

637
00:38:41,404 --> 00:38:43,448
right about now.

638
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:54,501
Gerti, where are we?

639
00:38:54,584 --> 00:38:56,044
Well...

640
00:38:56,044 --> 00:38:58,004
according
to my coordinates,

641
00:38:58,088 --> 00:38:59,798
- We are...

642
00:38:59,798 --> 00:39:01,591
I think that

643
00:39:09,683 --> 00:39:12,185
Camel poop!

644
00:39:13,353 --> 00:39:16,189
Someone's gonna pay!

645
00:39:16,272 --> 00:39:18,400
Cordezes...

646
00:39:23,613 --> 00:39:25,031
I like your new office.

647
00:39:25,115 --> 00:39:27,450
It's smaller... cozy.

648
00:39:27,534 --> 00:39:30,954
Especially... smaller.

649
00:39:33,873 --> 00:39:35,542
So many successful missions.

650
00:39:35,625 --> 00:39:37,252
Amazing, isn't it?

651
00:39:37,293 --> 00:39:38,878
Remember this one?

652
00:39:38,962 --> 00:39:41,089
Oh. Which mission is that?

653
00:39:41,172 --> 00:39:42,966
- Mexico.

654
00:39:43,049 --> 00:39:44,968
Of course.

655
00:39:47,137 --> 00:39:48,930
Actually,
that was the one mission

656
00:39:49,014 --> 00:39:50,682
we never accomplished.

657
00:39:50,765 --> 00:39:51,683
Ingrid...

658
00:39:51,766 --> 00:39:54,352
don't start
with your parents again.

659
00:39:54,394 --> 00:39:56,521
It's funny
you should mention them.

660
00:39:56,604 --> 00:39:59,983
No. When I mention your
parents, it is the exact
opposite of funny.

661
00:40:00,025 --> 00:40:02,610
- Doesn't it bother
you that we never got
their full blessing?

662
00:40:02,694 --> 00:40:05,280
- Frankly, you deserve another
chance to show them
- All right, all right.

663
00:40:05,363 --> 00:40:08,033
Invite them if you want,
but I won't be here.

664
00:40:08,074 --> 00:40:10,952
Tell them that I had a...
I had to go on another mission,

665
00:40:11,036 --> 00:40:13,747
that - that we're having
a little problem on the moon.

666
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:16,416
My father loves the moon.

667
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:25,508
You invited them already,
didn't you?

668
00:40:25,592 --> 00:40:27,135
Mm... define "invite."

669
00:40:27,218 --> 00:40:28,345
Donnagon: Cortezes.

670
00:40:28,428 --> 00:40:29,387
What?

671
00:40:29,471 --> 00:40:32,766
I have some bad news.
May I come in?

672
00:40:33,808 --> 00:40:34,809
- Certainly, sir.
- Yes, sir.

673
00:40:34,851 --> 00:40:36,394
- Great.

674
00:40:43,276 --> 00:40:45,111
Here he is.

675
00:40:52,535 --> 00:40:54,871
Two of
our Spy Kid operatives

676
00:40:54,954 --> 00:40:56,706
- Are lost
on the Ukata assignment.

677
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:58,083
Your children had
that assignment.

678
00:40:58,166 --> 00:40:59,626
I'm so sorry, Donnagon.
How can we help?

679
00:40:59,709 --> 00:41:01,961
Actually,
my children are safe

680
00:41:02,003 --> 00:41:05,090
somewhere in the Gobi Desert,
I believe.

681
00:41:05,173 --> 00:41:07,342
Uh, I'm sorry to say
that Carmen and Juni

682
00:41:07,425 --> 00:41:10,220
are somehow the ones
on the Ukata assignment

683
00:41:10,261 --> 00:41:11,846
a computing error
of some kind.

684
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:13,390
- Communications?
- None.

685
00:41:13,473 --> 00:41:15,266
Their DragonSpy ship
doesn't show up

686
00:41:15,308 --> 00:41:16,935
on radar or satellite.

687
00:41:17,018 --> 00:41:18,436
- Greg, lngrid,

688
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,189
you guys risked your lives
once before to save me.

689
00:41:21,272 --> 00:41:22,691
Let me go now

690
00:41:22,774 --> 00:41:26,319
and personally bring
your children back.

691
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:27,529
No. Thank you.

692
00:41:27,612 --> 00:41:28,988
Thank you, Donnagon,

693
00:41:29,072 --> 00:41:31,449
but, respectfully,
we have to do this ourselves.

694
00:41:31,533 --> 00:41:33,702
- If you could provide
tactical backup

695
00:41:33,743 --> 00:41:35,745
and surveillance support
of our efforts,

696
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:37,080
we'll leave immediately.

697
00:41:37,163 --> 00:41:38,873
Okay, yeah.

698
00:41:46,631 --> 00:41:48,967
Uh, lngrid...

699
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:52,637
I know this may be
a bad time, but, um...

700
00:41:53,013 --> 00:41:55,432
Your parents are here.

701
00:42:15,535 --> 00:42:17,704
- But you guys told me
you were coming next Tuesday.

702
00:42:17,787 --> 00:42:19,831
This is a very dangerous
assignment,

703
00:42:19,873 --> 00:42:21,416
and you have to wait here.

704
00:42:21,499 --> 00:42:22,667
Well, we want to help.

705
00:42:22,751 --> 00:42:25,420
- Don't worry.

706
00:42:25,503 --> 00:42:27,589
You taught me
everything I know.

707
00:42:27,672 --> 00:42:29,674
Yes...

708
00:42:29,758 --> 00:42:33,553
but not everything we know.

709
00:42:33,636 --> 00:42:35,638
Of course not, Dad.
See you in a few hours.

710
00:42:35,722 --> 00:42:37,766
- Thanks, honey.

711
00:42:49,694 --> 00:42:52,155
I still don't like him.

712
00:42:54,491 --> 00:42:54,616
Juni...

713
00:42:54,616 --> 00:42:56,659
Juni...

714
00:42:56,743 --> 00:42:59,162
was that there before?

715
00:43:02,123 --> 00:43:05,752
That wasn't there
a minute ago, was it?

716
00:43:05,794 --> 00:43:08,463
Are you kicking me?

717
00:43:08,546 --> 00:43:09,839
I'm way over here!

718
00:43:09,881 --> 00:43:13,968
I felt something
against my foot.

719
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:17,430
There's something under me!
Come look!

720
00:43:18,056 --> 00:43:19,849
I don't see anything, Juni.

721
00:43:19,933 --> 00:43:23,645
Let's just concentrate
on getting to shore.

722
00:43:24,896 --> 00:43:27,607
Okay, it's about 200 yards.

723
00:43:27,607 --> 00:43:31,319
- If we kick steadily
at one foot per kick,

724
00:43:31,319 --> 00:43:33,988
we'll reach it in, um...

725
00:43:34,072 --> 00:43:37,951
- 25 minutes?

726
00:43:37,992 --> 00:43:39,953
- I don't know.

727
00:43:39,994 --> 00:43:42,706
My calculator
doesn't work.

728
00:43:45,583 --> 00:43:47,085
Juni, what did you do?

729
00:43:47,168 --> 00:43:49,546
The air's coming
out of our suits!

730
00:43:49,629 --> 00:43:52,424
We're heading towards shore!

731
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:09,024
"Travel heavy"!

732
00:44:11,067 --> 00:44:12,777
Good idea!

733
00:44:12,861 --> 00:44:14,404
All right.

734
00:44:14,487 --> 00:44:16,823
Give it a rest.

735
00:44:18,241 --> 00:44:21,036
Okay, we're gonna set up
a campsite,

736
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:24,122
put up the tent,
build a little fire.

737
00:44:24,205 --> 00:44:26,666
And roast marshmallows?

738
00:44:33,298 --> 00:44:34,883
I can't believe this!

739
00:44:34,966 --> 00:44:36,468
What happened?

740
00:44:36,551 --> 00:44:38,428
- Nothing - that's just it.

741
00:44:38,511 --> 00:44:40,180
That was supposed to make
an instant campfire,

742
00:44:40,263 --> 00:44:41,765
and that was supposed to make
a shelter.

743
00:44:42,932 --> 00:44:45,143
None of our gadgets work.

744
00:44:45,185 --> 00:44:48,104
You mean we have to use
our heads?

745
00:44:48,188 --> 00:44:49,814
Yes.

746
00:44:57,864 --> 00:44:59,991
Big office...

747
00:45:01,951 --> 00:45:06,081
Director
of the O.S.S.'s office.

748
00:45:06,164 --> 00:45:08,500
Big.

749
00:45:27,936 --> 00:45:29,854
Did you find the source
of equal or greater power?

750
00:45:29,938 --> 00:45:31,815
It emanates from the north side
of the island.

751
00:45:31,898 --> 00:45:33,191
Have you located
the Island Man?

752
00:45:33,274 --> 00:45:35,068
He's somewhere underground.

753
00:45:35,151 --> 00:45:38,738
Yeah, well, start digging.
I'm on my way.

754
00:45:47,455 --> 00:45:49,499
Come on, Juni.

755
00:45:49,582 --> 00:45:51,167
Let's go check out the island.

756
00:45:51,251 --> 00:45:52,711
I just set up camp.

757
00:45:52,794 --> 00:45:54,087
See?

758
00:45:57,424 --> 00:45:58,925
Sure wish Gary was here.

759
00:45:59,009 --> 00:46:02,929
He'd want to find out
who was behind all this.

760
00:46:06,474 --> 00:46:09,436
Aw, man!

761
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:12,063
All right, let's go.

762
00:46:15,316 --> 00:46:17,360
Wow!

763
00:46:17,444 --> 00:46:20,030
This place is amazing!

764
00:46:20,071 --> 00:46:22,365
Check out that rock!

765
00:46:23,616 --> 00:46:25,952
Looks like a hot dog.

766
00:46:26,953 --> 00:46:31,166
Well, I've seen enough.
Let's go back to the beach.

767
00:46:31,332 --> 00:46:32,709
What?

768
00:46:32,792 --> 00:46:34,252
Listen.

769
00:46:34,252 --> 00:46:37,464
- I hear something humming.

770
00:46:41,468 --> 00:46:42,802
Somebody here has power.

771
00:46:42,886 --> 00:46:46,222
We need to find out who
and for what.

772
00:46:47,974 --> 00:46:49,934
- Destination - Ukata.

773
00:46:49,976 --> 00:46:54,314
Estimated time of arrival...
one minute and counting.

774
00:46:55,774 --> 00:46:58,193
How fast are we going?

775
00:46:58,485 --> 00:46:59,736
85 knots.

776
00:46:59,819 --> 00:47:02,280
Well... go faster.

777
00:47:02,364 --> 00:47:04,282
With pleasure.

778
00:47:06,534 --> 00:47:08,411
Faster.

779
00:47:11,164 --> 00:47:13,958
Faster.

780
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,669
Can't go faster.

781
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:16,836
Faster.

782
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,254
I broke the fast thingy.

783
00:47:19,339 --> 00:47:20,799
Faster!

784
00:47:30,058 --> 00:47:32,394
- All right...

785
00:47:32,477 --> 00:47:34,479
now what?

786
00:47:37,607 --> 00:47:40,777
This is terrific.

787
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:42,445
You know,
this is just great.

788
00:47:42,529 --> 00:47:44,447
You really did it
this time, Gerti.

789
00:47:44,489 --> 00:47:46,700
Are you kicking me?

790
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:50,286
- No. I'm way over here,
cheese ball.

791
00:48:17,981 --> 00:48:19,983
I'm gonna zap that sucker
to bits!

792
00:48:20,066 --> 00:48:22,444
- Come here!

793
00:48:27,157 --> 00:48:28,533
Wait!

794
00:48:30,452 --> 00:48:32,037
- Save it for the Cortezes.

795
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,246
Yeah...

796
00:48:33,329 --> 00:48:37,751
Excellent idea.

797
00:48:37,834 --> 00:48:37,876
I don't get it!
I saw it go through this wall.

798
00:48:37,876 --> 00:48:40,712
I don't get it!
I saw it go through this wall.

799
00:48:40,795 --> 00:48:42,756
What's your assessment, Juni?

800
00:48:42,839 --> 00:48:46,301
I'd think better
with food in my belly.

801
00:48:46,384 --> 00:48:48,553
I think we should go up there
and check it out.

802
00:48:48,636 --> 00:48:50,472
Up there...
to the top of the volcano?

803
00:48:50,513 --> 00:48:51,806
Yep.

804
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:54,517
Not even if my micrograpplers
were working.

805
00:48:54,601 --> 00:48:56,102
Gary would be brave enough
to do it.

806
00:48:56,186 --> 00:48:57,520
Nope.

807
00:48:57,604 --> 00:49:01,066
Nothing you can say
can change my mind.

808
00:49:03,985 --> 00:49:07,280
- What did you just say?
- I didn't.

809
00:49:09,366 --> 00:49:11,785
- Race you to the top!

810
00:49:29,219 --> 00:49:31,012
Ah. Volcano.

811
00:49:32,263 --> 00:49:35,183
Juni, stay back.

812
00:49:36,893 --> 00:49:39,813
It's not active.

813
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:43,733
Juni!

814
00:49:47,779 --> 00:49:49,656
What are you waiting for?

815
00:49:49,698 --> 00:49:51,199
Get me out of here!

816
00:49:51,282 --> 00:49:53,702
If my
auto retractor was working,

817
00:49:53,785 --> 00:49:55,453
I'd get us both
back up there!

818
00:49:55,537 --> 00:49:58,748
Uh. Okay.
I'm gonna grab your hand.

819
00:50:03,837 --> 00:50:05,171
Okay.

820
00:50:09,884 --> 00:50:11,720
My cellphone!

821
00:50:13,596 --> 00:50:15,390
Why'd you stop?

822
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:16,558
- Something wrong?

823
00:50:16,641 --> 00:50:17,976
Close your eyes.

824
00:50:18,059 --> 00:50:19,811
Why?

825
00:50:22,897 --> 00:50:23,982
Juni!

826
00:50:24,065 --> 00:50:25,150
What?

827
00:50:25,191 --> 00:50:27,027
I'm sorry!

828
00:50:42,584 --> 00:50:45,128
How long
have we been falling?

829
00:50:45,211 --> 00:50:46,755
I don't know.

830
00:50:46,796 --> 00:50:49,090
My watch doesn't tell time.

831
00:50:49,174 --> 00:50:50,884
Best guess?

832
00:50:50,967 --> 00:50:53,636
I'd say about three hours.

833
00:50:53,636 --> 00:50:55,889
Feels like four.

834
00:51:07,525 --> 00:51:10,528
How could you be eating
at a time like this?

835
00:51:10,612 --> 00:51:13,365
You know that tickling sensation
you get when you fall?

836
00:51:13,448 --> 00:51:14,532
Of course.

837
00:51:14,574 --> 00:51:18,620
That pretty much went away
after the first hour.

838
00:51:23,792 --> 00:51:26,002
What happened?

839
00:51:26,086 --> 00:51:28,922
I don't know!
We're floating!

840
00:51:31,383 --> 00:51:33,301
Who are you?

841
00:51:33,343 --> 00:51:35,595
- Do you see something?
- Over there, hiding.

842
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:36,888
What do you want?

843
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:38,556
I want to get down.

844
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:42,060
I'm Carmen Cortez,
special agent of the O.S.S.

845
00:51:42,143 --> 00:51:43,395
I'm Romero,

846
00:51:43,478 --> 00:51:47,607
sole inhabitant
of this island of Leeke Leeke...

847
00:51:49,192 --> 00:51:52,404
... sole human inhabitant,
that is.

848
00:51:52,487 --> 00:51:53,822
And you are?

849
00:51:53,905 --> 00:51:55,448
Tired and hungry.

850
00:51:55,532 --> 00:51:58,743
Nice to meet you,
Tired and Hungry.

851
00:51:59,744 --> 00:52:01,788
- Careful! You'll crush my island!

852
00:52:01,871 --> 00:52:03,331
Sorry.

853
00:52:03,415 --> 00:52:06,084
We just fell four hours.
We're a little clumsy right now.

854
00:52:06,167 --> 00:52:09,713
You weren't falling.
It was an illusion.

855
00:52:12,007 --> 00:52:13,800
Magic?

856
00:52:18,179 --> 00:52:19,848
Science.

857
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:26,855
Quickly,
we must get somewhere safe!

858
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,115
I'm a genetic specialist.

859
00:52:37,198 --> 00:52:40,368
I needed a controlled
environment for my experiments.

860
00:52:40,452 --> 00:52:42,704
The creatures
we've been hearing?

861
00:52:42,746 --> 00:52:44,998
My experiments...

862
00:52:45,081 --> 00:52:46,458
run amok.

863
00:52:46,541 --> 00:52:48,460
What happened?

864
00:52:52,213 --> 00:52:54,215
I thought I would make
a fortune from it.

865
00:52:54,257 --> 00:52:57,177
Kids everywhere would have
their own miniature zoos,

866
00:52:57,218 --> 00:53:00,013
- Right there
in their bedrooms.

867
00:53:00,096 --> 00:53:02,766
A miniature zoo?

868
00:53:02,849 --> 00:53:06,436
God's creatures...
on a manageable scale.

869
00:53:12,734 --> 00:53:14,861
Unbelievable.

870
00:53:14,903 --> 00:53:17,447
I called it
"Romero's Zoo"...

871
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:19,824
- Genetically miniaturized
animals.

872
00:53:19,908 --> 00:53:23,036
Lions, tigers, bears,
penguins...

873
00:53:25,622 --> 00:53:27,165
Monkeys.

874
00:53:28,583 --> 00:53:30,168
Monkeys in a barrel.

875
00:53:30,251 --> 00:53:31,795
Careful.

876
00:53:32,504 --> 00:53:34,047
Careful.

877
00:53:38,051 --> 00:53:39,719
One day,
I accidentally mixed up

878
00:53:39,803 --> 00:53:41,554
two or three
different test tubes

879
00:53:41,638 --> 00:53:45,183
and created
a new species... altogether.

880
00:53:53,692 --> 00:53:56,986
Romero's Zoo Too...

881
00:53:57,028 --> 00:54:00,949
an entirely new...
miniature zoo...

882
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:03,827
- Where each species
is unlike

883
00:54:03,868 --> 00:54:06,496
any creature
you've ever seen.

884
00:54:06,579 --> 00:54:08,248
Horse-fly?

885
00:54:10,542 --> 00:54:12,502
Uh... cat-fish.

886
00:54:13,753 --> 00:54:15,672
Spider-monkey?

887
00:54:17,424 --> 00:54:19,092
Bull-frog.

888
00:54:19,801 --> 00:54:20,760
Uh...

889
00:54:20,844 --> 00:54:21,970
slizzards.

890
00:54:22,053 --> 00:54:24,264
- Whoa.
- Stay away from those.

891
00:54:24,347 --> 00:54:26,641
- And so, I started to think,

892
00:54:26,725 --> 00:54:30,395
- "lf only I could make
them all a wee bit bigger,"

893
00:54:30,478 --> 00:54:33,898
You know, for kids
with meatier hands.

894
00:54:36,067 --> 00:54:38,361
That's where things went
very wrong.

895
00:54:38,445 --> 00:54:40,113
I applied a growth serum,

896
00:54:40,155 --> 00:54:43,241
and they took to it
all too well.

897
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:52,125
N-N-No!

898
00:54:52,208 --> 00:54:54,836
No!

899
00:54:54,919 --> 00:54:58,631
And I've been locked up
in here ever since.

900
00:54:59,382 --> 00:55:02,469
I'm afraid to go
out there again.

901
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:07,974
They've tried to gobble me up
on more than one occasion.

902
00:55:08,058 --> 00:55:11,186
Why do they despise me so?

903
00:55:11,269 --> 00:55:13,646
I created them.

904
00:55:16,483 --> 00:55:18,443
Do you think...

905
00:55:18,485 --> 00:55:20,737
God stays in Heaven

906
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:23,323
because he, too,
lives in fear

907
00:55:23,406 --> 00:55:25,241
of what he's created...

908
00:55:25,325 --> 00:55:27,327
here on Earth?

909
00:55:27,410 --> 00:55:30,663
Stop looking at me like that.

910
00:55:30,747 --> 00:55:32,082
I'm no loon.

911
00:55:32,123 --> 00:55:33,416
What I'm still trying
to figure out

912
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,293
is why this island
doesn't show up

913
00:55:35,377 --> 00:55:37,337
on even
our most advanced satellites.

914
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:40,590
I created a cloaking
device to shield my island
from curious eyes.

915
00:55:40,632 --> 00:55:43,510
Anything electronically
powered that comes
within a mile radius

916
00:55:43,593 --> 00:55:44,844
instantly shuts down.

917
00:55:44,886 --> 00:55:47,514
Any radar that passes
over me is displaced,

918
00:55:47,597 --> 00:55:50,642
creating the illusion
that my island doesn't exist.

919
00:55:50,725 --> 00:55:52,560
The Transmooker device.

920
00:55:52,644 --> 00:55:54,354
How did you know?

921
00:55:54,437 --> 00:55:56,398
Your cloaking device
is highly coveted.

922
00:55:56,481 --> 00:56:00,902
People everywhere are trying
to get their hands on it.

923
00:56:02,696 --> 00:56:06,741
Are you sure
we're the only humans here?

924
00:56:11,663 --> 00:56:13,039
There they are

925
00:56:13,123 --> 00:56:15,625
two children,
judging by their size.

926
00:56:15,709 --> 00:56:17,085
What is this?

927
00:56:17,168 --> 00:56:20,130
It's a miniature
of the island.

928
00:56:22,966 --> 00:56:25,552
The center point of
the volcano provides
a gravitational basis

929
00:56:25,635 --> 00:56:28,263
for which
my miniature creatures

930
00:56:28,346 --> 00:56:30,849
can line up exactly
to their larger
clone counterparts.

931
00:56:30,932 --> 00:56:33,893
- So, wherever your miniature
creatures are on this model,

932
00:56:33,935 --> 00:56:35,937
it's where the bigger ones
are outside?

933
00:56:35,979 --> 00:56:39,024
Correct. I can keep track
of their whereabouts this way.

934
00:56:39,107 --> 00:56:40,984
- See?

935
00:56:41,026 --> 00:56:43,653
The two intruder children are
being chased by a slizzard.

936
00:56:43,695 --> 00:56:44,988
- Gary and Gerti.
- Leave'em.

937
00:56:45,071 --> 00:56:46,781
We have to go help them!

938
00:56:46,823 --> 00:56:49,242
They shouldn't be
snooping around my
island to begin with!

939
00:56:49,325 --> 00:56:51,578
- I'm with you, dude.
- We have to help them.

940
00:56:51,661 --> 00:56:55,123
I'm not going out there!
I'll be eaten!

941
00:56:56,666 --> 00:57:00,337
What a bizarre man.

942
00:57:00,378 --> 00:57:02,547
- Help us!
- Help!

943
00:57:02,547 --> 00:57:03,882
Somebody!

944
00:57:03,965 --> 00:57:05,133
What are you guys doing
down there?

945
00:57:05,216 --> 00:57:06,426
That's real funny, clown.
Get us out!

946
00:57:06,509 --> 00:57:08,970
We tried to activate
our micrograpplers,

947
00:57:09,012 --> 00:57:10,472
but they didn't deploy!

948
00:57:10,555 --> 00:57:12,140
Nothing works here.

949
00:57:12,182 --> 00:57:14,976
Yeah, we know that now.
Thanks for the update,
carrot top.

950
00:57:15,018 --> 00:57:17,645
- Juni, come back.
They need our help.
- I'll help them.

951
00:57:17,729 --> 00:57:20,023
I want to get him
back over here

952
00:57:20,106 --> 00:57:22,817
so I can push him
back over myself.

953
00:57:22,859 --> 00:57:24,152
- Hurry up.
- Come on.

954
00:57:24,235 --> 00:57:25,820
Here, Gary.

955
00:57:25,862 --> 00:57:27,906
Gimme your hand.

956
00:57:28,907 --> 00:57:31,076
Thank you, Carmen.

957
00:57:34,913 --> 00:57:36,122
Here, Gerti...

958
00:57:36,206 --> 00:57:38,124
gimme your hand.

959
00:57:38,208 --> 00:57:39,959
Just wait
till my father gets here.

960
00:57:40,043 --> 00:57:42,712
Your father's coming?

961
00:57:46,424 --> 00:57:48,885
Where are you
taking me now, Carmen?

962
00:57:48,968 --> 00:57:50,512
Hold on.

963
00:57:55,058 --> 00:57:57,894
Why are you still hiding?
We're kids, not monsters.

964
00:57:57,977 --> 00:57:58,853
What's the difference?

965
00:57:58,937 --> 00:58:01,606
Relax.
They're O.S.S. agents, as well.

966
00:58:01,690 --> 00:58:03,650
- Level one.
- They're Donnagon's kids.

967
00:58:03,733 --> 00:58:05,235
Agent Donnagon?

968
00:58:05,318 --> 00:58:06,778
You work for the O.S.S.,
don't you?

969
00:58:06,861 --> 00:58:08,571
I work
for a man named Donnagon.

970
00:58:08,655 --> 00:58:09,698
Who is this guy?

971
00:58:09,781 --> 00:58:12,784
- Donnagon's not interested
in your creatures.
- Why not?

972
00:58:12,826 --> 00:58:14,536
The Transmooker device
that hides your island

973
00:58:14,619 --> 00:58:15,870
that's what Donnagon
really wants.

974
00:58:15,954 --> 00:58:18,039
That's not nearly
as interesting.

975
00:58:18,123 --> 00:58:19,958
Now that Donnagon's head
of the O.S.S.,

976
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,043
he has the power
to take it from you.

977
00:58:22,127 --> 00:58:23,753
What are you babbling
about now, Juni?

978
00:58:23,795 --> 00:58:25,213
The Transmooker you took

979
00:58:25,255 --> 00:58:27,215
from the president's
daughter, Gary.

980
00:58:27,257 --> 00:58:28,633
It was just a prototype.

981
00:58:28,675 --> 00:58:30,802
The real Transmooker device
is here on this island.

982
00:58:30,885 --> 00:58:32,262
It's even more powerful

983
00:58:32,345 --> 00:58:34,055
and can shut down
all technology on the planet.

984
00:58:34,139 --> 00:58:35,724
You said
your father's on his way.

985
00:58:35,807 --> 00:58:37,559
I think he's coming
to pick it up.

986
00:58:37,642 --> 00:58:39,102
You're all liars.

987
00:58:39,144 --> 00:58:41,688
Do you really think you're
gonna turn us on our own father?

988
00:58:41,771 --> 00:58:43,732
Did your dad tell you
the mission you went on

989
00:58:43,815 --> 00:58:46,067
was just a setup
for Carmen and me?

990
00:58:46,151 --> 00:58:47,569
- Why not?
- He has his reasons.

991
00:58:47,610 --> 00:58:50,071
That's what being a good spy
is all about

992
00:58:50,155 --> 00:58:51,990
trust no one.

993
00:58:52,032 --> 00:58:54,325
How to Be a Spy...
we've read it.

994
00:58:54,409 --> 00:58:55,910
Well, read it again.

995
00:58:55,994 --> 00:58:58,580
A good spy makes
no binding connections
with family or friends.

996
00:58:58,663 --> 00:59:00,623
Well, I don't believe
in that - do you?

997
00:59:00,707 --> 00:59:03,168
If you want to be a good spy,
you better believe it.

998
00:59:03,251 --> 00:59:06,296
My father's a great spy,
so let's grow up, shall we?

999
00:59:06,379 --> 00:59:07,964
Whatever my father's done,

1000
00:59:08,048 --> 00:59:09,799
it's what it takes to play
in the big world...

1001
00:59:09,883 --> 00:59:12,010
Iike it or not.

1002
00:59:12,093 --> 00:59:14,679
Come on, Gerti.
Let's go.

1003
00:59:14,721 --> 00:59:16,306
He's right.

1004
00:59:16,348 --> 00:59:19,142
Oh! Why can't you side with me
just once?

1005
00:59:19,184 --> 00:59:21,394
There are no sides...
you're right,
and he's right, too.

1006
00:59:21,478 --> 00:59:23,563
That's what
being a spy means.

1007
00:59:23,646 --> 00:59:24,981
Well, I don't like it.

1008
00:59:25,065 --> 00:59:26,483
- Then quit.
- I will.

1009
00:59:26,566 --> 00:59:28,360
Yeah, right.

1010
00:59:46,294 --> 00:59:48,004
- Donnagon was right...

1011
00:59:48,046 --> 00:59:51,007
- Their DragonSpy doesn't
show up anywhere on radar.

1012
00:59:51,091 --> 00:59:54,552
I am not interested
in finding the sub.

1013
00:59:56,471 --> 00:59:57,972
Remember that year

1014
00:59:58,056 --> 01:00:01,226
I insisted on doing the
children's dental work... myself?

1015
01:00:01,309 --> 01:00:03,144
How could I forget?

1016
01:00:03,228 --> 01:00:05,105
Well...

1017
01:00:05,188 --> 01:00:07,941
I installed
a nonelectrical tracking device

1018
01:00:08,024 --> 01:00:09,150
in their teeth

1019
01:00:09,234 --> 01:00:10,860
my own invention.

1020
01:00:10,944 --> 01:00:13,530
But I haven't been able
to test it,

1021
01:00:13,613 --> 01:00:15,448
until...

1022
01:00:15,490 --> 01:00:16,825
now.

1023
01:00:18,827 --> 01:00:20,537
- Honey, it works!
- Whoa...

1024
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:23,331
Hard to believe.

1025
01:00:23,415 --> 01:00:25,959
But according to this...

1026
01:00:26,334 --> 01:00:29,337
They're in
the middle of the ocean.

1027
01:00:29,421 --> 01:00:30,672
Above sea level.

1028
01:00:30,755 --> 01:00:34,259
But where they are on the map,
there's no land mass.

1029
01:00:34,342 --> 01:00:36,845
- How can that be?

1030
01:00:39,014 --> 01:00:40,598
Now what?

1031
01:00:42,142 --> 01:00:44,352
Something's got us.

1032
01:01:06,166 --> 01:01:08,209
- Aaah!
- What is it?

1033
01:01:08,293 --> 01:01:10,420
Your mother.

1034
01:01:10,462 --> 01:01:13,131
- Mom?
- We wanted to join you.

1035
01:01:13,214 --> 01:01:14,674
Are you nuts?

1036
01:01:14,716 --> 01:01:16,468
We needed a bigger boat.

1037
01:01:16,551 --> 01:01:18,345
And we brought real food

1038
01:01:18,428 --> 01:01:22,307
none of that freeze-dried stuff
you think's so chic.

1039
01:01:22,349 --> 01:01:24,225
- Son-in-law.
- Yeah?

1040
01:01:24,309 --> 01:01:25,852
Make yourself useful.

1041
01:01:25,935 --> 01:01:27,354
Why are you here?

1042
01:01:27,395 --> 01:01:31,232
We wanted to help
get our grandchildren back!

1043
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,778
We will get
our grandchildren back.

1044
01:01:34,819 --> 01:01:36,446
Gracias.
Oh, wait.

1045
01:01:36,529 --> 01:01:38,615
- You've got something
on your lip.
- What?

1046
01:01:38,698 --> 01:01:40,700
- Got it.

1047
01:01:40,784 --> 01:01:42,660
Uh, Mom...

1048
01:01:42,744 --> 01:01:46,456
Dad, I am a big girl now,
and I can take care
of myself, okay?

1049
01:01:46,498 --> 01:01:48,958
And Gregorio and l,
we can take care of
finding our children.

1050
01:01:49,042 --> 01:01:51,294
No, you don't seem
to understand.

1051
01:01:51,378 --> 01:01:55,298
This isn't you and Gregorio
simply saving the world again.

1052
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:59,010
This time, we all have much more
to lose if you fail

1053
01:01:59,094 --> 01:02:00,887
Carmen and Juni.

1054
01:02:00,970 --> 01:02:02,889
You cannot come with us.

1055
01:02:02,972 --> 01:02:04,599
It is too dangerous.

1056
01:02:04,683 --> 01:02:08,687
Oh, you mean,
we can't handle ourselves,

1057
01:02:18,488 --> 01:02:20,949
May I have
my moustache back...

1058
01:02:20,990 --> 01:02:22,701
please?

1059
01:02:23,952 --> 01:02:27,163
If Donnagon really is
on his way...

1060
01:02:28,206 --> 01:02:31,876
... we have to destroy
the Transmooker.

1061
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,461
Where is it?

1062
01:02:33,545 --> 01:02:36,923
The other side of the island.
Not easy to get to.

1063
01:02:37,007 --> 01:02:38,633
The journey alone

1064
01:02:38,717 --> 01:02:41,302
is more dangerous than
the Transmooker itself.

1065
01:02:41,386 --> 01:02:43,054
- I made sure of it.

1066
01:02:43,138 --> 01:02:44,723
Show us.

1067
01:02:44,806 --> 01:02:47,350
You're not going out there,
are you?

1068
01:02:47,434 --> 01:02:49,728
We don't have much choice,
do we?

1069
01:02:49,811 --> 01:02:51,271
With those monsters
running around?

1070
01:02:51,312 --> 01:02:53,064
I don't believe
they're monsters.

1071
01:02:53,106 --> 01:02:54,649
Maybe you shouldn't, either.

1072
01:02:54,691 --> 01:02:56,860
- Well, what should I believe?
- I don't know.

1073
01:02:56,943 --> 01:02:58,445
You're always in here hiding.

1074
01:02:58,528 --> 01:03:00,488
Maybe they
just wanna be with you.

1075
01:03:00,530 --> 01:03:01,740
Be with me?

1076
01:03:01,823 --> 01:03:03,783
They wanna be picking me
out of their teeth,

1077
01:03:03,867 --> 01:03:05,076
is what they wanna be.

1078
01:03:05,118 --> 01:03:07,245
You just gotta show them
who's boss.

1079
01:03:07,328 --> 01:03:09,497
You're not afraid?

1080
01:03:10,165 --> 01:03:13,126
First thing
you gotta do is...

1081
01:03:14,794 --> 01:03:17,255
... fall into this pit.

1082
01:03:20,050 --> 01:03:21,843
How does it work?

1083
01:03:21,926 --> 01:03:25,263
Supposedly,
they're run magnetically.

1084
01:03:26,348 --> 01:03:30,435
We should be able to ride over
a determined path.

1085
01:03:38,985 --> 01:03:42,072
We have to get the Transmooker
before they do.

1086
01:03:42,155 --> 01:03:43,740
Right.

1087
01:03:52,207 --> 01:03:53,875
Slizzards.

1088
01:03:53,875 --> 01:03:55,877
Oh, no.

1089
01:04:05,011 --> 01:04:06,846
This is cool.

1090
01:04:13,353 --> 01:04:14,270
Juni!

1091
01:04:14,354 --> 01:04:15,980
Juni!

1092
01:04:16,064 --> 01:04:18,525
- I think we should
get off now.

1093
01:04:18,608 --> 01:04:19,651
Why?

1094
01:04:19,693 --> 01:04:21,277
Trust me!

1095
01:04:23,655 --> 01:04:25,532
Jump now!

1096
01:04:34,374 --> 01:04:36,334
Gary and Gerti.

1097
01:04:36,334 --> 01:04:39,629
I told you
they were following us.

1098
01:04:46,386 --> 01:04:48,555
You have one new message.

1099
01:04:48,638 --> 01:04:49,889
Message one...

1100
01:04:49,973 --> 01:04:52,017
Hello, Alexandra,
it's me

1101
01:04:52,058 --> 01:04:53,560
agent Juni Cortez.

1102
01:04:53,643 --> 01:04:55,186
I'm on a mission...

1103
01:04:55,228 --> 01:04:57,022
I know I shouldn't be.

1104
01:04:57,063 --> 01:04:59,899
But I had an idea
for you and your father.

1105
01:04:59,983 --> 01:05:01,901
Simply tell him
you need to talk to him.

1106
01:05:01,985 --> 01:05:04,446
Tell him it's nothing urgent,

1107
01:05:04,529 --> 01:05:06,823
but someday
it might be urgent.

1108
01:05:06,906 --> 01:05:10,410
And you need to open the
communication lines right now.

1109
01:05:10,493 --> 01:05:12,871
So give me a call.
Love to hear from you.

1110
01:05:12,954 --> 01:05:14,372
And right now it's about

1111
01:05:14,456 --> 01:05:17,125
Silly me, I forgot my watch
doesn't tell time.

1112
01:05:17,208 --> 01:05:19,002
Heh.
And, uh

1113
01:05:19,586 --> 01:05:21,379
Something's wrong.
Take the wheel.

1114
01:05:21,421 --> 01:05:23,381
Gotta go. Good luck!

1115
01:05:23,381 --> 01:05:26,593
- Juni!
- Computer: End of message.

1116
01:05:30,972 --> 01:05:34,684
- Gregorio, the signal requires
that you go around it.
- He won't listen to you.

1117
01:05:34,768 --> 01:05:37,687
- He won't listen to you,
Mother.
- Choose another directi

1118
01:05:37,771 --> 01:05:41,232
- He wants to make sure
he loses the children again.

1119
01:05:41,316 --> 01:05:43,735
If you would only listen to us
and do what we're saying

1120
01:05:43,818 --> 01:05:45,528
you're tracking them
all wrong.

1121
01:05:45,612 --> 01:05:47,947
Ingrid, tell him
he's tracking them all wrong.

1122
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:49,866
Mom, Dad,
I have told you before,

1123
01:05:49,949 --> 01:05:52,452
and I will tell you again...
no backseat driving.

1124
01:05:52,535 --> 01:05:56,206
- Thank you.
- When Gregorio is at the wheel,
no one tells him what to do.

1125
01:05:57,957 --> 01:06:00,043
Turn here, honey.

1126
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:01,878
Sorry.

1127
01:06:01,961 --> 01:06:03,463
Okay.

1128
01:06:03,546 --> 01:06:07,509
- You're sure you're
reading that map correctly?

1129
01:06:07,509 --> 01:06:09,511
The coordinates correspond

1130
01:06:09,594 --> 01:06:12,639
to Carmen and Juni's
current position.

1131
01:06:12,722 --> 01:06:14,474
These are my children.

1132
01:06:14,516 --> 01:06:17,310
And I will find them my way!

1133
01:06:18,561 --> 01:06:19,729
Blah, blah, blah.

1134
01:06:19,813 --> 01:06:22,315
I never understand
a single word he's saying.

1135
01:06:22,357 --> 01:06:23,608
Never.

1136
01:06:23,692 --> 01:06:25,235
Not only were we set up,

1137
01:06:25,318 --> 01:06:27,654
but I bet Donnagon
knew all along

1138
01:06:27,737 --> 01:06:31,157
that you'd hack your way
into taking this assignment.

1139
01:06:31,241 --> 01:06:34,244
I was wondering
the same thing.

1140
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:37,330
Juni, open up.

1141
01:06:37,414 --> 01:06:38,998
What?

1142
01:06:39,082 --> 01:06:43,628
- Dad installed these trackers
in case we ever got lost.

1143
01:06:48,633 --> 01:06:51,886
Hurry. Take mine out.

1144
01:06:51,970 --> 01:06:54,639
And why are we doing this?

1145
01:06:58,935 --> 01:07:00,979
When we get lost,
who saves us?

1146
01:07:01,062 --> 01:07:02,856
Mom and Dad.

1147
01:07:02,897 --> 01:07:04,607
Now, if Mom and Dad
also disappear,

1148
01:07:04,691 --> 01:07:07,402
who's gonna stop Donnagon from
using the Transmooker device?

1149
01:07:07,485 --> 01:07:09,029
Donnagon wants us
all together

1150
01:07:09,112 --> 01:07:11,448
so he can destroy the island
and all of us with it.

1151
01:07:11,531 --> 01:07:14,367
Mom and Dad - even Romero.

1152
01:07:14,451 --> 01:07:17,328
We can't let Mom and Dad
find us...

1153
01:07:17,412 --> 01:07:19,581
or Donnagon wins.

1154
01:07:19,664 --> 01:07:22,542
- A big sacrifice.

1155
01:07:22,584 --> 01:07:24,878
Family is sacrifice.

1156
01:07:29,132 --> 01:07:30,508
What happened?

1157
01:07:30,592 --> 01:07:33,678
What did...
what did you just do?

1158
01:07:36,473 --> 01:07:38,433
We lost Carmen.

1159
01:07:39,851 --> 01:07:42,437
- A-And Juni?

1160
01:07:42,479 --> 01:07:44,814
Juni's still on-line.

1161
01:07:46,649 --> 01:07:48,777
I love you.

1162
01:07:52,947 --> 01:07:55,200
That can't be.

1163
01:07:57,077 --> 01:08:00,872
- Okay, okay.
What do we do?

1164
01:08:05,293 --> 01:08:07,128
I don't know.

1165
01:08:17,222 --> 01:08:18,556
Maybe this is like

1166
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:21,142
the mission of the spies
who didn't want to be found.

1167
01:08:22,394 --> 01:08:23,687
You know...

1168
01:08:23,728 --> 01:08:26,398
if they
don't want to be found,

1169
01:08:26,481 --> 01:08:29,776
maybe their position
is compromised.

1170
01:08:37,242 --> 01:08:42,414
Now, Gregorio, don't tell me
you didn't have a backup plan.

1171
01:08:43,581 --> 01:08:47,377
Ingrid, was Juni wearing
that charm necklace

1172
01:08:47,419 --> 01:08:50,296
I sent him for Christmas
last year?

1173
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:52,257
He never takes it off.

1174
01:08:52,298 --> 01:08:53,466
Then we got him.

1175
01:08:53,508 --> 01:08:58,054
I was worried about
Juni's well-being,

1176
01:08:58,138 --> 01:09:04,019
so I put a tracer
in his necklace.

1177
01:09:05,186 --> 01:09:06,771
There he is.

1178
01:09:06,855 --> 01:09:08,273
Thanks, Dad.

1179
01:09:08,356 --> 01:09:11,192
Are you sure you don't want me
to take over the wheel?

1180
01:09:11,234 --> 01:09:12,402
I - that's funny.

1181
01:09:12,485 --> 01:09:14,946
- It's funny.

1182
01:09:22,662 --> 01:09:24,497
Back to work.

1183
01:09:24,581 --> 01:09:26,416
Where are we?

1184
01:09:26,416 --> 01:09:27,584
Well...

1185
01:09:27,667 --> 01:09:31,504
not far from
the antechamber.

1186
01:09:31,546 --> 01:09:34,090
I think it's behind us.

1187
01:09:41,765 --> 01:09:42,807
Don't move.

1188
01:09:42,891 --> 01:09:45,185
Maybe it's friendly.

1189
01:09:46,770 --> 01:09:48,855
Maybe it's not.

1190
01:09:50,398 --> 01:09:52,609
Let's go!

1191
01:10:08,667 --> 01:10:10,335
It's an underwater cave.

1192
01:10:10,418 --> 01:10:12,754
We'll have to go
all the way around.

1193
01:10:12,796 --> 01:10:14,673
That'll take all day.

1194
01:10:14,756 --> 01:10:17,175
There must be a faster

1195
01:10:31,231 --> 01:10:33,233
Wow...

1196
01:10:33,274 --> 01:10:36,069
What is this place?

1197
01:10:39,072 --> 01:10:42,075
Do you think
that's real gold?

1198
01:10:42,158 --> 01:10:44,285
Gross!

1199
01:10:44,369 --> 01:10:46,913
This is so slimy.

1200
01:10:46,955 --> 01:10:48,915
I hate mold.

1201
01:10:48,998 --> 01:10:50,917
I can hear your thoughts.

1202
01:10:51,001 --> 01:10:52,502
What?

1203
01:10:52,585 --> 01:10:54,421
And you can hear mine!

1204
01:10:54,504 --> 01:10:56,089
Our mouths aren't moving,

1205
01:10:56,172 --> 01:10:58,591
but we can hear
what we're thinking.

1206
01:10:58,675 --> 01:11:00,593
Say something.

1207
01:11:02,554 --> 01:11:05,348
How strange.

1208
01:11:05,432 --> 01:11:08,268
We can only communicate
by thought.

1209
01:11:08,351 --> 01:11:09,894
- Magic.

1210
01:11:09,894 --> 01:11:11,438
Think something.

1211
01:11:11,479 --> 01:11:13,898
Um... your feet stink.

1212
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:17,694
I wonder.

1213
01:11:23,867 --> 01:11:27,620
Okay, this place
is really weird.

1214
01:11:27,662 --> 01:11:28,788
Let's go.

1215
01:11:28,872 --> 01:11:30,790
Good thinking.

1216
01:11:35,211 --> 01:11:38,715
Now, this is more like it.

1217
01:11:38,798 --> 01:11:42,177
Treasure.

1218
01:11:45,513 --> 01:11:47,515
Skeletons.

1219
01:11:47,599 --> 01:11:49,976
Dead skeletons.

1220
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:52,604
Is there any other kind?

1221
01:11:58,276 --> 01:12:03,573
This must've been where
the pirate prisoners
and treasure were kept.

1222
01:12:12,290 --> 01:12:15,418
This must've been
a pretty special necklace

1223
01:12:15,502 --> 01:12:17,754
for them to die
fighting over it.

1224
01:12:17,837 --> 01:12:20,090
One necklace
to rule them all

1225
01:12:20,131 --> 01:12:21,341
Put it back, Juni!

1226
01:12:21,383 --> 01:12:22,801
I didn't take it yet.

1227
01:12:22,884 --> 01:12:25,011
I can read your mind,
remember?

1228
01:12:25,095 --> 01:12:27,347
This land
is ancient and cursed.

1229
01:12:27,430 --> 01:12:29,891
If you take anything,
you'll doom us both.

1230
01:12:29,933 --> 01:12:31,851
Let's go!

1231
01:12:59,838 --> 01:13:02,590
Come on!
I think I found a way out.

1232
01:13:02,674 --> 01:13:04,050
Which way?

1233
01:13:04,092 --> 01:13:06,970
I don't know, you pick...
right or left?

1234
01:13:07,053 --> 01:13:09,264
Right.

1235
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:15,687
Wait a minute.

1236
01:13:15,770 --> 01:13:16,813
Oh, no!

1237
01:13:16,896 --> 01:13:19,399
We went in a circle.

1238
01:13:19,482 --> 01:13:20,442
What?

1239
01:13:20,525 --> 01:13:21,484
Come on.

1240
01:13:21,568 --> 01:13:23,778
Let's try it again.

1241
01:13:25,613 --> 01:13:28,700
Come on, Juni!
I know what we did wrong.

1242
01:13:28,742 --> 01:13:31,786
We've gotta go left.

1243
01:13:34,164 --> 01:13:36,249
Maybe I should
put this back.

1244
01:13:36,332 --> 01:13:37,292
Uh-oh.

1245
01:13:37,375 --> 01:13:40,211
Where are
the dead skeletons?

1246
01:13:48,303 --> 01:13:50,347
Carmen!

1247
01:13:59,147 --> 01:14:00,982
Juni!

1248
01:14:06,279 --> 01:14:08,239
Help me!

1249
01:14:17,207 --> 01:14:19,125
Hey, bonehead!

1250
01:14:21,336 --> 01:14:22,504
Wh

1251
01:14:26,966 --> 01:14:29,386
Oh, no.

1252
01:14:36,101 --> 01:14:37,686
Why is this happening?

1253
01:14:37,769 --> 01:14:39,604
I don't know!

1254
01:14:45,193 --> 01:14:46,194
Wait a minute!

1255
01:14:46,236 --> 01:14:48,446
You took something,
didn't you?

1256
01:14:48,488 --> 01:14:51,199
No!
Y-Y-You told me not to!

1257
01:14:51,783 --> 01:14:53,576
Why would l?

1258
01:14:55,954 --> 01:14:58,331
Juni!

1259
01:14:58,415 --> 01:14:59,874
Carmen!

1260
01:15:07,799 --> 01:15:09,134
Wait.

1261
01:15:14,305 --> 01:15:15,974
I'm sorry.

1262
01:15:24,941 --> 01:15:26,443
Carmen!

1263
01:15:26,526 --> 01:15:29,070
Carmen!

1264
01:15:36,369 --> 01:15:38,163
You too,

1265
01:15:38,204 --> 01:15:39,748
Yeah.

1266
01:15:40,999 --> 01:15:43,335
Where's your brother?

1267
01:15:43,376 --> 01:15:44,210
Did he get eaten?

1268
01:15:44,294 --> 01:15:48,298
No. He's out there
looking for Juni.

1269
01:15:48,381 --> 01:15:50,842
You know he squashed
Juni's bug on purpose.

1270
01:15:50,884 --> 01:15:52,927
Yeah, I know.

1271
01:15:53,011 --> 01:15:54,971
Now he wants to squash Juni.

1272
01:15:55,055 --> 01:15:58,725
Don't you think
we should get out of here?

1273
01:16:03,980 --> 01:16:08,526
Carmen!

1274
01:16:08,610 --> 01:16:10,236
I'm dreaming.

1275
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:12,947
I am totally dreaming.

1276
01:16:15,158 --> 01:16:17,869
And I'm hungry, too.

1277
01:16:31,174 --> 01:16:33,843
You like honey-roasted ham
and potatoes, don't you?

1278
01:16:33,927 --> 01:16:36,221
- That's what flavor this is.

1279
01:16:36,304 --> 01:16:38,473
Highly nutritious.

1280
01:16:38,473 --> 01:16:42,060
Packed with protein
and essential carbs.

1281
01:16:46,022 --> 01:16:49,234
Everything
a growing centaur needs.

1282
01:16:49,776 --> 01:16:51,736
You're welcome.

1283
01:16:59,911 --> 01:17:03,331
Well, well, well.
Your friend likes freeze-dried.

1284
01:17:03,373 --> 01:17:05,208
So does mine.

1285
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:18,596
All right, buddy.
Let's kick their butts.

1286
01:17:19,222 --> 01:17:21,266
- Heh heh heh.
We're waiting.

1287
01:17:21,349 --> 01:17:22,892
Come on.

1288
01:17:22,934 --> 01:17:26,896
- Can't let you bust up
my dad's machine, Juni.

1289
01:17:29,482 --> 01:17:31,901
So I guess I'll just have to
bust you up.

1290
01:17:31,943 --> 01:17:33,153
We can take'em.

1291
01:17:33,236 --> 01:17:35,155
Come on, buddy.
We can take'em.

1292
01:17:35,238 --> 01:17:39,284
I don't think
we can take'em!

1293
01:17:44,122 --> 01:17:46,583
Must try and help them.

1294
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,501
Must.

1295
01:17:48,585 --> 01:17:51,129
So, even if your dad is
behind all this,

1296
01:17:51,212 --> 01:17:53,965
you'd still side with him
over what's right?

1297
01:17:54,049 --> 01:17:56,801
Right? How do you ever know
what's right?

1298
01:17:56,885 --> 01:17:58,011
Trust me,

1299
01:17:58,053 --> 01:18:01,264
when the moment comes,
you'll know.

1300
01:18:05,518 --> 01:18:08,229
I think that moment's come.

1301
01:18:17,614 --> 01:18:19,366
Come on!

1302
01:18:19,449 --> 01:18:22,410
Show'em who's boss.

1303
01:18:22,494 --> 01:18:25,080
Show'em who's boss.

1304
01:18:25,163 --> 01:18:26,998
I'm the boss.

1305
01:18:31,795 --> 01:18:33,463
I'm the...

1306
01:18:48,144 --> 01:18:49,979
- Look out!

1307
01:18:52,857 --> 01:18:54,943
Forward, go, man.

1308
01:19:03,284 --> 01:19:05,662
Come on, spidey.
You can do it.

1309
01:19:05,704 --> 01:19:07,706
- Yeah!

1310
01:19:20,844 --> 01:19:23,388
Your creature's lame.

1311
01:19:23,471 --> 01:19:25,765
So are you, lame-o.

1312
01:19:25,849 --> 01:19:27,726
It's all over
for you, squirt.

1313
01:19:27,809 --> 01:19:32,022
Too bad your dork sister's
not here to cheer me on.

1314
01:19:34,065 --> 01:19:35,900
- Hey!

1315
01:19:41,114 --> 01:19:43,074
Ya-a-a-a-a-a-h!

1316
01:20:03,303 --> 01:20:05,263
I don't want to hurt you,
Carmen.

1317
01:20:05,347 --> 01:20:08,683
You're so full
of shiitake mushrooms.

1318
01:20:12,020 --> 01:20:14,314
Put it down, Carmen.

1319
01:20:15,857 --> 01:20:17,650
Put it down.

1320
01:20:24,491 --> 01:20:26,576
Okay.

1321
01:20:26,659 --> 01:20:29,454
All right.

1322
01:20:29,537 --> 01:20:31,581
Gerti,
a little assistance here.

1323
01:20:31,664 --> 01:20:34,000
Don't look at me, brother.
You're fighting a girl.

1324
01:20:34,084 --> 01:20:36,252
You're gonna lose.

1325
01:20:40,882 --> 01:20:42,926
I'm siding with you.

1326
01:20:43,009 --> 01:20:44,803
Thanks.

1327
01:20:44,886 --> 01:20:47,097
But just this once.

1328
01:20:52,268 --> 01:20:53,853
Cortezes.

1329
01:21:01,820 --> 01:21:04,406
You gonna help me or not?

1330
01:21:27,178 --> 01:21:29,556
Well, there it is.

1331
01:21:29,639 --> 01:21:31,850
How do you know?

1332
01:21:31,933 --> 01:21:35,478
'Cause it's big and weird
and in the middle of the room.

1333
01:21:35,562 --> 01:21:37,272
Good point.

1334
01:21:44,988 --> 01:21:46,031
Careful, Juni!

1335
01:21:46,114 --> 01:21:47,615
If you don't
shut it down right,

1336
01:21:47,699 --> 01:21:49,534
you can bring the entire world
to an end.

1337
01:21:49,617 --> 01:21:50,660
Thanks.

1338
01:21:50,702 --> 01:21:51,828
I'm serious.

1339
01:21:51,911 --> 01:21:54,831
Well, we have to
shut it down.

1340
01:21:55,373 --> 01:21:57,667
This turns that off.

1341
01:21:58,710 --> 01:22:01,254
And that turns this off.

1342
01:22:02,922 --> 01:22:07,469
He said there's something tricky
about the third switch.

1343
01:22:09,596 --> 01:22:11,264
Let's see.

1344
01:22:12,265 --> 01:22:14,893
Too late, Gary.
We got here first.

1345
01:22:14,976 --> 01:22:16,895
Just stand up against the wall
like a good boy

1346
01:22:16,978 --> 01:22:18,229
and leave us alone.

1347
01:22:18,271 --> 01:22:21,983
Nice try, but we brought
friends this time.

1348
01:22:22,359 --> 01:22:23,401
Romero.

1349
01:22:23,485 --> 01:22:25,445
What are you doing
outside of your cage?

1350
01:22:25,487 --> 01:22:27,447
I have no idea.

1351
01:22:29,741 --> 01:22:30,784
Donnagon.

1352
01:22:30,867 --> 01:22:32,243
Hello, agents.

1353
01:22:32,327 --> 01:22:34,662
Warming it up for me?

1354
01:22:35,121 --> 01:22:37,957
Are you ready to cooperate
this time, Romero?

1355
01:22:38,041 --> 01:22:39,459
- I...
- Good.

1356
01:22:39,542 --> 01:22:43,922
This should be pain...
and simple.

1357
01:22:46,424 --> 01:22:47,926
What did you do?

1358
01:22:48,009 --> 01:22:49,594
He started the Transmooker!

1359
01:22:49,636 --> 01:22:52,263
You said three switches.

1360
01:22:52,347 --> 01:22:55,350
The entire world
will shut down instantly.

1361
01:22:55,433 --> 01:22:56,851
Good going, cheese ball.

1362
01:22:56,893 --> 01:22:58,186
What do we do?

1363
01:22:58,269 --> 01:23:02,357
You must bind together
the three toggle switches.

1364
01:23:04,901 --> 01:23:06,486
It won't stay up!

1365
01:23:06,569 --> 01:23:08,697
- Machete elastic wonder!
- Machete elastic wonder!

1366
01:23:08,780 --> 01:23:10,740
Here - grab it!

1367
01:23:16,246 --> 01:23:18,707
Give it to me.
Give it!

1368
01:23:18,790 --> 01:23:20,041
Dad...

1369
01:23:20,125 --> 01:23:22,043
Give it to me.

1370
01:23:22,669 --> 01:23:24,713
Give it to me...

1371
01:23:26,256 --> 01:23:28,049
... or else.

1372
01:23:28,049 --> 01:23:30,510
Give it to him, Carmen.

1373
01:23:36,474 --> 01:23:37,517
Where'd it go?

1374
01:23:37,559 --> 01:23:38,935
Where'd it go?

1375
01:23:39,019 --> 01:23:40,437
I don't know.

1376
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:41,980
The spork took it.

1377
01:23:42,022 --> 01:23:44,649
Back to its... nest.

1378
01:23:45,859 --> 01:23:47,485
I know
where the nest is, Dad.

1379
01:23:48,737 --> 01:23:51,698
I also have Romero's
instruction book.

1380
01:23:51,781 --> 01:23:52,907
Hey.

1381
01:23:52,991 --> 01:23:54,659
Brat.

1382
01:23:54,743 --> 01:23:56,661
Come on!

1383
01:24:10,759 --> 01:24:13,595
It's just over that big hill.

1384
01:24:14,846 --> 01:24:17,766
Are you sure this is
the right way?

1385
01:24:17,807 --> 01:24:20,268
My watch has a GPS satellite,
you dope.

1386
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:21,728
Wait a minute.

1387
01:24:21,811 --> 01:24:23,229
How can this be?

1388
01:24:23,313 --> 01:24:25,023
When you took out
the Transmooker,

1389
01:24:25,106 --> 01:24:27,108
the island cloaking device
was shut down.

1390
01:24:27,192 --> 01:24:30,153
Then what are we doing
on foot?

1391
01:24:30,278 --> 01:24:32,405
Later, Romero.

1392
01:24:46,336 --> 01:24:47,295
There it is!

1393
01:24:47,379 --> 01:24:49,047
Get up there, Dad!
Come on!

1394
01:24:49,130 --> 01:24:50,548
Okay, Magna Men,

1395
01:24:50,590 --> 01:24:54,219
we're gonna need a human ladder
starting right... here.

1396
01:24:54,302 --> 01:24:55,887
- Carmen!

1397
01:25:04,229 --> 01:25:05,146
What?

1398
01:25:05,230 --> 01:25:08,692
An agent's only as good
as her gadgets.

1399
01:25:17,117 --> 01:25:20,036
They're heading
for the beach.

1400
01:25:29,838 --> 01:25:31,589
Help!

1401
01:25:46,396 --> 01:25:48,857
The kid was right.

1402
01:26:09,294 --> 01:26:11,296
- What are you doing?

1403
01:26:11,379 --> 01:26:13,089
Trying to remote-pilot
our submarine to the surface

1404
01:26:13,173 --> 01:26:14,549
so we can get out of here.

1405
01:26:14,591 --> 01:26:18,511
Get on your GPS
and see where Mom and Dad are.

1406
01:26:20,221 --> 01:26:21,598
This can't be right.

1407
01:26:21,681 --> 01:26:25,268
This shows that
they're right next to us.

1408
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:31,900
Oh, no!

1409
01:26:31,900 --> 01:26:34,027
That's no way
to greet your grandparents.

1410
01:26:34,110 --> 01:26:35,362
Come on.

1411
01:26:35,445 --> 01:26:36,696
Grandpa!

1412
01:26:36,780 --> 01:26:39,282
Ah, Juni.

1413
01:26:39,366 --> 01:26:41,701
Come here, come here.

1414
01:26:43,912 --> 01:26:47,707
Always take this with you
wherever you go,

1415
01:26:47,791 --> 01:26:49,751
and I'll always be there.

1416
01:26:49,834 --> 01:26:52,045
I promise, Grandpa.

1417
01:26:52,754 --> 01:26:54,589
Not you guys!

1418
01:26:55,048 --> 01:26:56,883
You don't want to be rescued.

1419
01:26:56,966 --> 01:26:58,760
You don't want to be saved.

1420
01:26:58,843 --> 01:27:00,345
That's all right.

1421
01:27:00,428 --> 01:27:02,681
We thought you might...
you might need us.

1422
01:27:02,764 --> 01:27:04,432
Go talk to your father.

1423
01:27:04,516 --> 01:27:06,309
- Dad!
- Hey, Mom.

1424
01:27:06,393 --> 01:27:08,395
- Come on, Dad. Look at me.
- Two spies
who didn't want to be found?

1425
01:27:08,478 --> 01:27:09,896
- Yes.
- Yes. I like your thinking.

1426
01:27:09,979 --> 01:27:12,148
But you know what? Those spies
didn't have me for a mom.

1427
01:27:12,232 --> 01:27:13,566
- Come on.
- Thank you.

1428
01:27:13,650 --> 01:27:14,943
Hey.

1429
01:27:16,486 --> 01:27:18,822
I'll always need you.

1430
01:27:20,740 --> 01:27:21,783
Come on.

1431
01:27:21,866 --> 01:27:23,368
Carmen Elizabeth Juanita...

1432
01:27:23,451 --> 01:27:25,203
Come here to your papa.

1433
01:27:25,286 --> 01:27:26,496
You okay, hon?

1434
01:27:26,538 --> 01:27:28,289
All right. Information.
Quick.

1435
01:27:28,373 --> 01:27:30,333
Okay, we have
the Transmooker device,

1436
01:27:30,417 --> 01:27:32,544
but we need to get off
this island right now.

1437
01:27:32,627 --> 01:27:36,339
What do you think
we're here for? Let's go.

1438
01:27:36,631 --> 01:27:38,425
We'll explain it on the way.

1439
01:27:38,508 --> 01:27:41,803
You won't believe
who's behind this.

1440
01:27:41,803 --> 01:27:44,681
It couldn't be
any more perfect.

1441
01:27:44,764 --> 01:27:47,350
This better not be
what I think it is.

1442
01:27:47,434 --> 01:27:50,145
It's all being taken care of,
all right?

1443
01:27:50,228 --> 01:27:52,105
Get the Transmooker device,
Felix.

1444
01:27:52,147 --> 01:27:54,274
Felix?

1445
01:27:54,357 --> 01:27:56,401
Sorry, Gregorio.

1446
01:28:05,785 --> 01:28:07,328
A little power goes
a long way, doesn't it?

1447
01:28:09,247 --> 01:28:11,416
Reprogram this one, Gerti.

1448
01:28:11,499 --> 01:28:14,502
I want to start by wiping
the Cortez family

1449
01:28:14,586 --> 01:28:16,171
from the face of the Earth.

1450
01:28:16,212 --> 01:28:17,630
Uncle Felix, how could you?

1451
01:28:17,672 --> 01:28:19,466
I'm not your uncle.

1452
01:28:19,549 --> 01:28:21,259
But we treated you
like family.

1453
01:28:21,343 --> 01:28:23,261
Donnagon said if I joined him

1454
01:28:23,303 --> 01:28:26,931
he - he wouldn't get rid of me
like he's gonna do to you guys.

1455
01:28:27,015 --> 01:28:28,516
You can't argue with that.

1456
01:28:28,558 --> 01:28:30,393
Do you still have power
in your watch?

1457
01:28:30,477 --> 01:28:32,395
- Yep.

1458
01:28:32,479 --> 01:28:34,397
Programming complete, Father.

1459
01:28:34,481 --> 01:28:35,565
Thank you, Gerti.

1460
01:28:35,648 --> 01:28:38,735
Try remote-piloting
the choppers.

1461
01:28:40,445 --> 01:28:44,240
Well, Cortezes,
any last words?

1462
01:28:44,324 --> 01:28:46,034
None that I can say
in front of my children.

1463
01:28:46,117 --> 01:28:48,828
Not to mention your mother.

1464
01:28:56,544 --> 01:29:00,173
Let's settle this
the old-fashioned way.

1465
01:29:02,008 --> 01:29:04,052
- Kick his butt!
- Yeah, kick his butt!

1466
01:29:04,844 --> 01:29:06,888
- Not like that.

1467
01:29:08,473 --> 01:29:10,058
Headbutt.

1468
01:29:18,274 --> 01:29:20,110
Sleeper hold.

1469
01:29:22,487 --> 01:29:24,072
Use his own weight
against him.

1470
01:29:24,155 --> 01:29:25,490
Yeah.

1471
01:29:30,245 --> 01:29:31,538
Ah, get up!

1472
01:29:31,621 --> 01:29:33,123
Do what I showed you
last night!

1473
01:29:34,207 --> 01:29:35,667
Suplex.

1474
01:29:40,964 --> 01:29:43,299
- Even I can fight better
than that.
- Mom!

1475
01:29:43,383 --> 01:29:46,136
Triple backflip!

1476
01:30:15,540 --> 01:30:17,542
Gerti?

1477
01:30:17,625 --> 01:30:18,752
What did you...

1478
01:30:18,835 --> 01:30:20,462
Why?

1479
01:30:20,545 --> 01:30:22,380
Oh, don't even
get me started.

1480
01:30:22,464 --> 01:30:23,923
Just wait till Mom finds out

1481
01:30:24,007 --> 01:30:26,259
you tried to take over
the world again.

1482
01:30:26,343 --> 01:30:28,178
No.
Please, please, please.

1483
01:30:28,261 --> 01:30:30,972
D-Don't tell your mother.

1484
01:30:31,056 --> 01:30:32,515
Please?

1485
01:31:00,877 --> 01:31:02,045
Uh, hello.

1486
01:31:02,128 --> 01:31:04,923
Hello, there, Mr. President.

1487
01:31:05,632 --> 01:31:08,134
By order of the president,

1488
01:31:08,218 --> 01:31:11,388
you've been
temporarily disavowed.

1489
01:31:17,727 --> 01:31:19,562
You're fired.

1490
01:31:21,439 --> 01:31:24,234
Looks like I lost this round,
but I'll be back.

1491
01:31:24,317 --> 01:31:25,944
Hopefully, you're on
the good side next time.

1492
01:31:26,027 --> 01:31:28,113
We'll see, but...

1493
01:31:29,197 --> 01:31:31,658
... you never know.

1494
01:31:31,741 --> 01:31:33,368
Don't worry.

1495
01:31:33,451 --> 01:31:36,037
He gets out of line,
I'll straighten him out.

1496
01:31:36,121 --> 01:31:38,039
You go, Gerti.

1497
01:31:42,919 --> 01:31:45,380
You tried to save us.

1498
01:31:45,463 --> 01:31:46,756
Why?

1499
01:31:53,513 --> 01:31:56,182
Because you are my family.

1500
01:31:57,017 --> 01:31:59,477
You know...

1501
01:31:59,561 --> 01:32:01,438
there isn't
a man on this Earth

1502
01:32:01,521 --> 01:32:04,441
we'd ever think would be
good enough for our daughter,

1503
01:32:04,482 --> 01:32:05,734
but, um...

1504
01:32:05,817 --> 01:32:08,445
You come pretty close.

1505
01:32:13,992 --> 01:32:15,702
By order of the president,

1506
01:32:15,785 --> 01:32:18,621
you are the new director
of the O.S.S.

1507
01:32:18,705 --> 01:32:21,458
Congratulations.

1508
01:32:21,541 --> 01:32:22,542
Do

1509
01:32:22,625 --> 01:32:24,419
are they

1510
01:32:29,841 --> 01:32:32,135
Level one.

1511
01:32:33,345 --> 01:32:34,804
No, thanks.

1512
01:32:34,888 --> 01:32:36,639
You don't want it?

1513
01:32:36,723 --> 01:32:38,183
I'm leaving the O.S.S.

1514
01:32:38,266 --> 01:32:41,478
I've seen what it takes
to be a top spy,

1515
01:32:41,519 --> 01:32:44,939
and I think I can be
better use to the world

1516
01:32:45,023 --> 01:32:48,902
by just being the best... me.

1517
01:32:48,985 --> 01:32:51,154
But what about
all the cool gadgets?

1518
01:32:51,237 --> 01:32:54,115
I got the best gadget
right here.

1519
01:32:54,157 --> 01:32:59,287
Use number one...
a stylish bracelet.

1520
01:32:59,371 --> 01:33:00,705
See ya around?

1521
01:33:00,789 --> 01:33:02,665
Yes.

1522
01:33:09,464 --> 01:33:10,965
Go ahead. Say it.

1523
01:33:11,049 --> 01:33:12,175
What?

1524
01:33:12,258 --> 01:33:15,387
I told you so.

1525
01:33:16,638 --> 01:33:18,056
Never.

1526
01:33:19,808 --> 01:33:21,142
Wait.

1527
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:24,312
Uh...

1528
01:33:26,564 --> 01:33:27,857
Thank you.

1529
01:33:27,941 --> 01:33:30,026
You got it, boss.

1530
01:34:22,579 --> 01:34:24,372
- Carmen!
- Carmen!
- Carmen!
- Carmen!

1531
01:34:24,456 --> 01:34:26,958
- Carmen!
- Carmen!
- Carmen!
- Carmen!

1532
01:34:27,042 --> 01:34:29,252
- Carmen!
- Carmen!
- Carmen!
- Carmen!

1533
01:34:29,336 --> 01:34:31,254
- Carmen!
- Carmen!
- Carmen!
- Carmen!

1534
01:34:31,338 --> 01:34:32,922
I am not going out there.

1535
01:34:32,964 --> 01:34:34,132
Oh, yes, you are.

1536
01:34:34,174 --> 01:34:35,717
You're a spy,
you're undercover,

1537
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:38,136
and you have to make them
think you're a pop star.

1538
01:34:38,219 --> 01:34:39,554
I can't sing.

1539
01:34:39,596 --> 01:34:40,972
Who can these days?

1540
01:34:41,014 --> 01:34:43,683
I can't tell you
how many artists have used

1541
01:34:43,767 --> 01:34:45,685
my Machete miracle microphone.

1542
01:34:45,769 --> 01:34:48,396
# I can't sing #

1543
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:50,774
This'll make you dance
like Britney Lopez.

1544
01:34:50,857 --> 01:34:52,400
Hey, what about me?

1545
01:34:52,484 --> 01:34:55,737
This'll make you play
like Angus Van Santana.

1546
01:34:55,820 --> 01:34:56,738
Cool.

1547
01:34:56,821 --> 01:34:59,532
Now get out there and rock!

1548
01:35:00,075 --> 01:35:02,118
# Who, what,
when, where, and why? #

1549
01:35:02,202 --> 01:35:04,037
# Do I delight in #

1550
01:35:04,079 --> 01:35:07,540
# What do I intend
to find this time? #

1551
01:35:07,624 --> 01:35:09,709
# Run around, jumping down,
bounce and bound and... #

1552
01:35:09,793 --> 01:35:11,586
# Find another way to duck
and hide #

1553
01:35:11,670 --> 01:35:13,463
# This isle of #

1554
01:35:13,546 --> 01:35:15,590
# Dreams #

1555
01:35:15,674 --> 01:35:16,675

Who?

1563
01:35:33,900 --> 01:35:35,235
What?

1564
01:35:35,944 --> 01:35:37,278
When?

1565
01:35:37,862 --> 01:35:39,531
# Dreams #

1566
01:35:39,572 --> 01:35:41,324
Where?

1567
01:35:42,992 --> 01:35:44,327
When?

1568
01:35:44,994 --> 01:35:46,579
And why?

1569
01:36:01,636 --> 01:36:04,264
# Who, what,
when, where, and why? #

1570
01:36:04,347 --> 01:36:05,598
# Do I delight in #

- Whoo!
- Whoo!
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

1585
01:37:32,352 --> 01:37:35,063
What, are you surprised
your gadgets work?

1586
01:37:35,105 --> 01:37:39,275
I just realized I never put
any batteries in this.

1587
01:37:49,035 --> 01:37:50,787
Action.

1588
01:37:55,542 --> 01:37:57,335
Back to one.

1589
01:37:59,587 --> 01:38:00,505
Ready.

1590
01:38:00,588 --> 01:38:02,382
Yeah, but...

1591
01:38:03,508 --> 01:38:05,135
Guys, we're looking at light
on her face.

1592
01:38:05,218 --> 01:38:06,553
Oops.

1593
01:38:08,513 --> 01:38:11,599
My precious.

1594
01:38:11,683 --> 01:38:13,476
We're nearing
the destination zone,

1595
01:38:13,518 --> 01:38:14,686
where all

1596
01:38:14,728 --> 01:38:16,312
No. And then
the next sentence is

1597
01:38:16,396 --> 01:38:18,106
"The location radius
where all the disappearances."

1598
01:38:18,189 --> 01:38:19,107
Okay.

1599
01:38:19,190 --> 01:38:20,942
We're nearing
destination zone.

1600
01:38:20,984 --> 01:38:24,696
The location radius
where all the disappear

1601
01:38:25,196 --> 01:38:26,614
Stop!

1602
01:38:26,656 --> 01:38:28,074
Okay.

1603
01:38:28,158 --> 01:38:29,993
We're nearing
destination zone,

1604
01:38:30,035 --> 01:38:32,120
where all the dis

1605
01:38:32,704 --> 01:38:33,913
Stop!

1606
01:38:33,955 --> 01:38:36,666
I know it.
I don't know it.

1607
01:38:36,791 --> 01:38:39,169
Juni, take wheel!

1608
01:38:39,252 --> 01:38:40,920
What is...

1609
01:38:42,756 --> 01:38:44,466
What is it?

1610
01:38:48,636 --> 01:38:50,722
Okay, what is it?

1611
01:39:03,777 --> 01:39:05,695
Okay.

1612
01:39:14,746 --> 01:39:16,706
Well, well, well, well, whoo!

1613
01:39:16,748 --> 01:39:18,833
Man, you're not an easy man
to find,

1614
01:39:18,917 --> 01:39:21,503
you and your island
of Leeke Leeke.

1615
01:39:21,586 --> 01:39:24,089
I'm Dinky. Winks, that is.

1616
01:39:24,172 --> 01:39:26,257
Heard you had a wild place here,
and, well, sir,

1617
01:39:26,341 --> 01:39:27,926
I was thinking
you might be interested

1618
01:39:27,967 --> 01:39:30,303
in a little,
business proposition.

1619
01:39:30,387 --> 01:39:31,888
You ready?

1620
01:39:31,971 --> 01:39:33,431
Theme park.

1621
01:39:33,473 --> 01:39:34,599
Think about it.

1622
01:39:34,641 --> 01:39:35,850
Families on safari,

1623
01:39:35,934 --> 01:39:39,604
crazy critters
running all over the place.

1624
01:39:39,854 --> 01:39:42,023
Hey, there, fella.

1625
01:39:46,778 --> 01:39:49,948
You can see it already,
can't you?

1626
01:39:50,240 --> 01:39:51,533
We'd be great together.

1627
01:39:51,616 --> 01:39:53,493
What do you say?
