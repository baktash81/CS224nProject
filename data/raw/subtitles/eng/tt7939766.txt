10

It's there when I sleep, when I wake up.</i>

<i>It's always there. Always.</i>

12

<i>I haven't been thinking about it for long.</i>

13
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:16,500

14

15
00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:21,083
<i>When did it start?</i>

16
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:23,291
<i>What if this thought
wasn't conceived by me,</i>

17
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,416

[inhales]

19
00:01:26,416 --> 00:01:28,708

20

<i>Maybe I've actually known all along.</i>

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,333

it was always going to end.</i>

<i>"Sometimes the thought
is closer to the truth,</i>

00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:47,750

29

than I've seen in years.</i>

<i>Maybe in my life.</i>

49

[chuckling] No, I don't think so.

80
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:47,833
<i>Maybe it's human nature to keep going
in the face of this knowledge.</i>

- pretty fast now.
- No, no, no, I'm... I'm fine.

- Oh.
- [Jake] So...

104
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:49,958
I'm sorry.

105
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:53,333
I'm just saying
that there might not be much of a spread,

106
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:56,041
that she might not be up to
a lot of cooking.

Um...

108
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,458
- She hasn't been well.
- What's going on with her?

109
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:04,916
Just saying, if you <i>want</i>

it would probably be fine...

in terms of appetite spoiling.

113

It might even be advisable.
[slight chuckle]

Getting old ain't for sissies,

[Jake] True, although...

135
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:23,625
one might just take issue
with her use of the word sissy...

136
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:26,500
- Yeah, of course. Yeah. Yes, sir.
- [Jake] ...as a pejorative.

137
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:28,583
It was a different time.

138
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,875
[young woman] <i>I guess it's curiosity.</i>

139
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:35,125
<i>Jake is certainly hard to figure.</i>

140
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,500
<i>Maybe it's like a window into his origins.</i>

141
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,333
<i>The child being father of the man and all.</i>

142
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:43,250
Are you a fan of Wordsworth, then?

143
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:46,083
- Wordsworth?
- [Jake] William Wordsworth, the poet?

144
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:48,333
Um...

145
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:51,250
Not... I'm not familiar, really.

146
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:52,333
Why do you ask?

147
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:55,541
Just thinking about him for some reason.

148
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,500
- [chuckles]
- He popped into my head.

149
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:58,750
[exhales]

150
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:04,375
His poem <i>Ode: Intimations of Immortality
from Recollections of Early Childhood.</i>

151
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,166
- Jesus, that's the title?
- [Jake chuckles]

152
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,708
- [chuckles] Sounds like an entire poem.
- Well…

153
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:17,916
- [young woman] <i>I'm thinking of...</i>
- Get your words' worth with Wordsworth.

Do you want to hear how it starts?

- It's just that the...
- I'm not a metaphorical-type gal.

157
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,666
It's just that that one speaks to me.

158
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,875
Uh, incidentally, Wordsworth wrote
a series of poems to a woman named Lucy.

159
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:38,333
Like me!

160
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:41,791

162
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,208
Oh, yikes.

163
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:49,000
Well, the comparison goes
only as far as your name.

164
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:49,916
Phew.

165
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:53,708
[Jake] And that you are ideal,

166
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:56,208
- of course.
- Yeah, yeah. [inhales sharply]

167

00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,708
Uh, it's just a friend.

173
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:15,541
I'm not gonna answer.

174
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,916
- You can, I don't mind. You should.
- Eh, it's OK

175
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,416
- It's all right.
- I don't mind.

176
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:23,458
[young woman chuckles]

177
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:25,791
[sighs]

178
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:29,833
That's odd. Did you see that swing set

179
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,208
- we just passed?
- What swing set?

180
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:33,208
It was weird.
It was this beautiful new swing set

181
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:34,916
in front of an abandoned house.

182
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,166
- No. I missed it.
- What?

183
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,375
I didn't see it.

184
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:39,791
Why would that be there?

185
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:41,958
I mean, clearly no one's lived
in that house for years.

186
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,875
Someone's moving in, and...

187
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:48,750
they brought the swing set first?
That's all I can think of.

188
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,000
- I...
- [young woman] That seems

189
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,875
like an unlikely sequence of events.

190
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:59,041
[exhales] You know, like,
to have something

191
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:02,625
to entertain the kids while the parents
are getting the house ready.

192
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,875
[exhales]

193
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:05,791
Odd.

194
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:07,416
They're saying, uh,

195
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,083
- there might be a fair amount of snow.
- Yeah?

196
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,666
They're predicting it.

197
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,208
Do you think we should maybe turn back?

198
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,291
I've got a fair amount of...

199
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,916
well, a lot, actually,
of work to do tomorrow.

200
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:22,916
I need to get home tonight so that I...

201
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,083
I think we'll be OK.
I've got tire chains in the trunk.

202
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,041
- What are you working on?
- Oh, I have a paper due Wednesday.

203
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,041
Which one is this?

204
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:36,333
Susceptibility to rabies infection

205
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:38,625
in the sensory dorsal
root ganglia neurons.

206
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,791
The trigeminal ganglia as well, right?

207
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,125
Yes, exactly.

208
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:44,750
[both chuckle]

209
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:46,208
Point for me.

210
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:51,666
Interested in and knowledgeable
about my girlfriend's work.

211
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,000
Point for Jake.

212
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,416
- How's the paper going?
- Oh...

213
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,125
[sighs] It's nowhere actually.

214
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:02,708
I really do need to get back tonight,
deal with it first thing.

215
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:03,750
I'll get you home!

216
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:05,541
Chains.

217
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:06,708
Chains.

218
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,625
[young woman] <i>Yeah, I do like Jake.</i>

219
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,250
<i>And he's educated.</i>

220
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:15,041
<i>Our fields are different,
but he's curious and keeps up.</i>

221
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,500
<i>That's a good thing.
It's in the pro column.</i>

222
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:20,083
<i>And he's cute in his awkward way.</i>

223
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,541
<i>- We're interesting together too.</i>
- [giggles]

224
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,208
[young woman]
<i>People look at us when we're together.</i>

225
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,833
<i>"Who's that couple?"
I don't get looked at alone.</i>

226
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:31,708
<i>And Jake doesn't either.
Jake tells me that he feels it.</i>

227
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:33,750
<i>Feels invisible.</i>

228
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,083
You want to listen to something?

229
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,458
[deep breath]

230
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,833
Sorry, uh, what?

231
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:50,666
Um...

232
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:56,833
I asked if you want to listen
to some music?

233
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,291
Oh, yeah, sure.

234
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:01,375
[turns on radio]

235
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:02,958
[tuning radio]

236
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:06,666
When you get out this far,
there's not much signal.

237
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,958
["Many A New Day" plays]

238
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:13,041
[laughing]

239
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,333
It's an odd song.

240
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:17,208
[laughs] To...

241
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:22,083
- Out here in... in the middle of nothing.
- It's from <i>Oklahoma!</i>

242
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:23,125
The musical.

243
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,916
I didn't know you were a fan
of musical theater.

244
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,583
Well, I'm not, really.

245
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:30,333
Anyway, I just know a few musicals.Uh...

246
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:34,291
<i>Oklahoma, Phantom,
Carousel, South Pacific,</i>

247
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:36,416
<i>Guys and Dolls, Flower Drum Song...</i>

248
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,458

<i>My Fair Lady.</i>

254
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,416
But I know <i>Oklahoma</i> best, I guess.

255
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,250
They do it every few years...

256
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:55,208
[inhales deeply]

257
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,000
For obvious reasons.

258
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,458
Wait, who does it every few years?

259
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:02,041
Sometimes I see kids

260
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:05,458
who were in past productions, you know,

261
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:09,416
um, at the supermarket,
working at stores in town.

262

Good for her.

273
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:48,208
She... she's protesting too much,
it turns out.

274
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:49,500
We've all been there.

275
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,208
[exhales]

276
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:52,666
Where?

277
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,166
Protesting too much
how OK everything is.

278
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,291
[inhales] That's why I like road trips.

279
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,916
It's good to remind yourself

280
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:05,375
the world's... larger
than the inside of your own head.

281
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:06,875
- You know?
- Mm-hmm.

282
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,000
[both] Perspective.

283
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,083
[Jake] Perspective.

284
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,291
[young woman] <i>It is beautiful out here.</i>

285
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,958

287
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:23,583
<i>Hmm...</i>

<i>I should remember, but I don't.</i>

289
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:28,750
<i>Nothing's coming to mind.</i>

290
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:31,500
<i>It's odd. I'm foggy
about so many things lately.</i>

291
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,458
Do you like this type of landscape?

292
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:34,375
Mmm.

293
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:35,666
Yeah, it's beautiful.

294
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,791
It's melancholy.

295
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,625
I do like that.

296
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:39,916
[Jake inhales deeply]

297
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,333
It's the poet in you.

[young woman chuckles]

299
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:44,291
Yeah.

300
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,000
I suppose so.

301
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:48,583
Maybe, I don't know.

302
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,708
You been working on anything?

303
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,875
Uh, I-I... [clears throat]

304
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,416
I just finished something.

305
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,500
Yeah. I don't... I don't know.

306
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:02,625
- [Jake] Can I hear it?
- You can read it.

307
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:06,625
I like to hear them in your voice,
and you're so good at reciting them.

308
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:08,166
Not really, but thanks.

309
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,375
It'll go with the poetic scenery.

310
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,208
[exhales] I don't know, Jake,
I just don't...

311

I don't really feel much like performing

312
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,583
- right now.
- Come on, it'll pass the time.

I don't want you to get bored.

It's called "Bonedog."

or just a wife-shaped loneliness
waiting for you.

323
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:46,833
Coming home is terribly lonely...

324
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:52,083
so that you think
of the oppressive barometric pressure

325
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:54,791
back where you have just come from
with fondness,

326
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:57,166
because everything's worse
once you're home.

327
00:15:57,625 --> 00:16:01,041
You think of the vermin
clinging to the grass stalks...

[inhales]

329
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,083
long hours on the road,

00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:07,375
roadside assistance and ice creams,

331
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:10,666
and the peculiar shapes of certain clouds

332
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:11,916
and silences

333
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,000
with longing,
because you did not want to return.

334
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,208
Coming home is...

335
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,083
just awful.

336
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:24,916
And the home-style silences and clouds

337
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,958
contribute to nothing
but the general malaise.

338
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:31,416
Clouds, such as they are,
are in fact suspect

339
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,875
and made from a different material
than those you left behind.

340
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:39,125
You yourself were cut
from a different cloudy cloth,

341
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,333
returned,

342
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,083
remaindered,

343
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:46,875
ill-met by moonlight,

344
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,333
unhappy to be back,

345
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,791
slack in all the wrong spots.

346
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,541
Seamy suit of clothes,

dishrag-ratty, worn.

00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:56,791
[wind whistling]

349
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,166
You return home,

350
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:01,458
moon-landed,

351
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:03,750
foreign.

352
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,125
The Earth's gravitational pull,

353
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,958
an effort now redoubled...

354
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:11,375
[inhales deeply]

355
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:13,875
Dragging your shoelaces loose...

356
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:14,791
[exhales]

357
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,125
And your shoulders,

358
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:20,958
etching deeper the stanza of worry
on your forehead.

359
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,875
You return home deepened,

360
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:27,083
a parched well linked to tomorrow

361
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,625
by a frail strand of...

362
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:32,333
anyway.

363
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,958
You sigh into the onslaught
of identical days,

364
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:45,041
one might as well, at a time.

365
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:48,791
Well...

366
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:50,958
anyway,

367
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:52,875
you're back.

368
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:58,166
The sun goes up and down
like a tired whore,

369
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:05,250
the weather immobile like a broken limb
while you just keep getting older.

370
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:10,416
Nothing moves, but the shifting tides
of salt in your body.

371
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,083
Your vision blears,

372
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,250
you carry your weather with you;

373
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,208
the big, blue whale;

374
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,166
a skeletal darkness.

375
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,250
You come back

376
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:26,791
with X-ray vision...

377
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,500
your eyes have become a hunger.

378
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:36,000
You come home with your mutant gifts

379
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:38,791
to a house of bone.

380
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,583
Everything you see now,

381
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
all of it...

382
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,375
bone."

383
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:53,541
Wow.

384
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,833
[young woman]
Well, wow is an all-purpose exclamation.

385
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:58,583
I just realized that. [chuckles]

386
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:01,833
It might be... It can...

387
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,333
It can mean you... you loved it,

388
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:08,208
or it can mean there are no words
to describe how...

389
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:09,833
[sniffs] ...how rubbish it is.

390
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,083
I love it.

391
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,500
I love it. It's amazing.

392
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:16,791
It's... it's like...

393
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:19,375
It's like you wrote it about me.

394
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,666
Oh, you know, I-I-I...

395
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:24,291
I guess that's what one hopes for
when writing a poem. [sniffs]

396
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:26,541
[Jake] What's that?

397
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:29,791
Some universality in the specific,
I don't know.

398
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:31,541
It's like you wrote it about me.

399
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:33,958
[sighs]

400
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:36,250
[young woman]
<i>I'm thinking of ending things.</i>

401
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,791
<i>Jake is really great.</i>

402
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,083
<i>He's really sweet.</i>

403
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:40,166
<i>He's sensitive,</i>

404
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,125
<i>and he listens to me, and he's smart.</i>

405
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,250
<i>But there's just something... </i>[sighs]

406
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,333
<i>Ineffable.</i>

407
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:48,291
<i>Profoundly, unutterably,</i>
<i>un</i>-<i>fixably wrong here.</i>

408
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,708
-Are you OK
-Yeah.

409
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:52,625
You just seem sort of far away is all.

410
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,500
I'm... just thinking.

411
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,666
- [sniffs]
- About what?

412
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,833
[inhales deeply]

413
00:19:57,916 --> 00:19:59,333
Uh...

414
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:01,625
I don't know, just... [exhales]

415
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,666
Vague in my head stuff.

416
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,208
Vague in your head stuff.

417
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,208
I guess I was thinking about time.

418
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,666
- Really?
- Yeah.

419
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:14,333
Like we're on a train
and it takes us where it takes us.

420
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:16,500
There's no veering off,
there's no side trips,

421
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,750
and like Mussolini's train,
it runs on time.

422
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:21,541
But that's not really true
about Mussolini and trains.

423
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:24,791
The improvements
in the railway system preceded him.

424
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,666
He just took the credit.

425
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,500
And even still,
they didn't always run on time.

426
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,666
I wasn't really talking
about Mussolini's train...

427
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,166
And anyway, you...
you can always jump off a train.

428
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,250
[young woman] In movies.

429
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:39,833
In real life, you'll probably die
jumping from a moving train. [chuckles]

430
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,125
That's... that's very true.

431
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:47,583
I suppose I watch too many movies.

432
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,750
Hmm. Everybody does.

433
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,375
Societal malady.

434
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,416
[Jake] Fill my brain with lies
to pass the time,

435
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,333
in the blink of an eye,

436
00:20:57,416 --> 00:21:01,458
and an eye blink
in excruciatingly slow motion.

437
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,666
[young woman] It's like the rabies virus,

438
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,625
attaching itself to our ganglia,

439
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:09,041
changing us into itself.

440
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:10,708
Viruses are monstrous.

441
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:12,375
Everything wants to live, Jake.

442
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,916
[inhales]

443
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:16,791
Viruses are just one more example
of everything.

444
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:17,875
But...

445
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:21,166
Even fake, crappy movie ideas
want to live.

446
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,958
Like, they grow in your brain,

447
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,333
replacing real ideas.

448
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:27,250
That's what makes them dangerous.

449
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,041
But, did you know...

450
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:32,375
there are insects that blow themselves up?

451
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,833
- Yes.
- Not everything wants to live.

452
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:35,666
There are certain ants, certain aphids.

453
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,125
For the good of their community.

454
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:38,875
There are suicide bombers.

455
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:39,791
[scoffs]

456
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,125
[pig] Come...

457
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:48,041
join me.

458
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:51,583
So not everything wants to live.

459
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:54,541
Right?

460
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:58,208
True. Well, they...

461
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:00,083
they want their communities to live.

462
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:02,416
Which is sort of like themselves,
writ large.

463
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:07,000
Anyway, we don't really know
if they want anything.

464
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:12,083
It's just most likely
how they're programmed.

465
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,000
Maybe we're all programmed, right?

466
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,958
[sighs]

467
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:23,291
[imitates explosion sound]

468
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:25,125
And now we're both dead.

469
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:26,458
[Jake] Ta-da!

470
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:29,333
[wind whistling]

471
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:42,416
[wind howling]

472
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,875
So, uh, I'm not... I'm not ready to go in.

473
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:58,541
I-I need to stretch my legs, long legs.

474
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:00,250
Long drive.

475
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:02,750
What? What, isn't that rude?

476
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:05,500
She clearly knows we're here.
We've been waving at each other for...

477
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:06,666
quite a long time.

478
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,416
They know I like to stretch my legs.
Come on, I'll show you around.

479
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,250
Jake, I don't know,
it's... it's... it's... it's cold

480
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:14,083
- and it's getting dark.
- Come on.

481
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:16,250
Come on, I'll give you the abridged tour.

482
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:19,625
[young woman groans]

483
00:23:31,416 --> 00:23:32,666
[Jake] Maybe, we'll...

484
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:34,666
come back in the spring,

485
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:38,583
and we can lie out here
and look up at the universe.

486
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:41,541
[window creaking open]

487
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:46,166
The sheep.

488
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,833
[lamb bleats]

489
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:52,333
[sheep bleats]

490
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:54,250
- Let's say hi.
- [sheep bleating]

491
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:56,375
- Hi, sheep.
- Hi, sheep.

492
00:23:57,583 --> 00:24:00,166
[young woman] <i>There is something</i>
<i>dreary and sad in here.</i>

493
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,416
<i>And it smells.</i>

494
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,666
<i>I wonder what it must be like
to be a sheep.</i>

495
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:07,666
<i>Spend one's entire life in this miserable,
smelly place doing nothing.</i>

496
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,791
<i>- Eating, shitting, sleeping...</i>
- [sheep bleats]

497
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:12,250
<i>- over and over.</i>
- [Jake] Well, there you have it.

498
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:13,166
[sheep bleats]

499
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,625
- The sheep.
- [lamb bleats]

500
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:16,833
- [young woman] What happened to the lambs?
- [Jake] What?

501
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:18,291
- [sheep bleats]
- What will happen...

502
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:21,208
I don't know what you're asking me.
They're already dead, so wh...

503
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:23,666
what else can happen to them?

504
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:27,500
- Well, I mean, will they be buried?
- Probably be burned

505
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:29,041
- come spring.
- [sheep bleats]

506
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:31,666
But they're frozen solid for now,
so they're fine.

507
00:24:32,416 --> 00:24:33,541
[wind howling]

508
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:34,583
No worries.

509
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:39,625
Come on, I'll show you the... the old pen
where we used to keep the pigs.

510
00:24:39,708 --> 00:24:42,041
- [sheep bleats]
- They had to put them down.

511
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:45,416
That's too bad.
- [Jake] Rotten situation, the pigs.

512
00:24:45,833 --> 00:24:49,041
Life isn't always pretty on a farm.
Something you should know.

513
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:52,708
[lamb bleating]

514
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:55,458
So what... what happened to them?

515
00:24:55,541 --> 00:24:56,958
- To the pigs?
- [lamb bleats]

516
00:24:58,458 --> 00:24:59,666
[lamb bleats]

517
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:03,333
Forget it. Uh, I don't think
you'd like the story.

518
00:25:03,416 --> 00:25:05,541
Can't do that. You have to tell me now.

519
00:25:05,625 --> 00:25:07,083
- Yeah?
- Yes! Jesus.

520
00:25:07,166 --> 00:25:08,375
[Jake] OK, well...

521
00:25:08,833 --> 00:25:09,708
um...

522
00:25:10,791 --> 00:25:12,916
- [lamb bleats]
- My dad hadn't been in

523
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,458
to check on the pigs for a few days.

524
00:25:14,541 --> 00:25:15,958
My parents were busy.

525
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,958
He'd just tossed their food into the pen.

526
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:20,958
But after a few days,

527
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:25,291
he noticed that they were all just lying
in this corner all the time,

528
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:26,916
so he went in to check on them.

529
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,958
They didn't look well.

530
00:25:28,041 --> 00:25:30,291
He decided he'd better try to move them.

531
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:31,833
And they're heavy.

532
00:25:33,375 --> 00:25:35,291
They're pigs, right?

533
00:25:35,708 --> 00:25:39,125
But yeah, he... he finally managed
to move one, and discovered...

534
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:44,791
its entire underside
was filled with maggots.

535
00:25:46,583 --> 00:25:48,375
Both pigs were being eaten alive.

536
00:25:48,458 --> 00:25:50,666
[wind howling]

537
00:25:53,666 --> 00:25:54,708
[deep breath]

538
00:25:54,791 --> 00:25:57,125
Life can be brutal on a farm.

539
00:26:00,666 --> 00:26:02,291
Should we go inside? It's getting cold.

540
00:26:04,583 --> 00:26:07,375
[young woman] <i>Everything has to die.</i>
<i>That's the truth.</i>

541
00:26:07,916 --> 00:26:10,750
<i>One likes to think
that there is always hope.</i>

542
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:12,750
<i>That you can live above death.</i>

543
00:26:13,166 --> 00:26:17,208
<i>And it's a uniquely human fantasy
that things will get better,</i>

544
00:26:17,291 --> 00:26:22,083
<i>born perhaps of the uniquely
human understanding that things will not.</i>

545
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:24,375
<i>There's no way to know for certain.</i>

546
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:26,541
<i>But I suspect humans are the only animals</i>

547
00:26:26,625 --> 00:26:28,708
<i>that know the inevitability
of their own deaths.</i>

548
00:26:28,791 --> 00:26:31,458
- [cart creaking]
<i>- Other animals live in the present.</i>

549
00:26:32,708 --> 00:26:33,958
<i>Humans cannot,</i>

550
00:26:34,291 --> 00:26:35,791
<i>so they invented hope.</i>

551
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,333
Hello?

552
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:46,333
Hello?

553
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:47,958
I'm here.

554
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:49,208
We're here.

555
00:26:58,083 --> 00:26:59,125
Hello?

556
00:27:00,625 --> 00:27:01,458
Hello?

557
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:04,416
It's Jake!

558
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,166
Hello?

559
00:27:15,583 --> 00:27:16,416
Hello?

560
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,375
- [dad] We'll be right down.
- [Jake] OK

561
00:27:21,916 --> 00:27:23,625
So...

562
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,958
Do you want slippers?

563
00:27:29,041 --> 00:27:30,750
- I...
- Floors are cold here.

564
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:33,083
- Old houses. Will you hold this, please?
- Yeah.

565
00:27:33,166 --> 00:27:34,458
Yeah, thanks, I think.

566
00:27:35,166 --> 00:27:36,000
[Jake] Um...

567
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,916
They'll be big on you.
They're my old ones, but they are warm.

568
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,041
- Ah! <i>Voilà.</i>
- [giggling]

569
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,125
- None for you?
- No.

570
00:27:49,208 --> 00:27:51,333
No, no. No, no, no, no, no, no,
you should have these.

571
00:27:51,416 --> 00:27:52,416
- These are yours.
- Oh, no.

572
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,625
What kind of gentleman
would that make me?

573
00:27:58,041 --> 00:28:00,750
My slippers are your slippers.

574
00:28:02,083 --> 00:28:03,750
- You sure?
- I am.

575
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:08,083
[Jake speaking Spanish]

576
00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:09,375
[young woman laughs]

577
00:28:09,458 --> 00:28:11,166
[Jake] Um, have a seat.

578
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,333
[floorboards creaking]

579
00:28:21,708 --> 00:28:22,833
They'll be right down.

580
00:28:32,416 --> 00:28:33,416
Music?

581
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,333
Sure.

582
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,541
[instrumental music playing]

583
00:28:47,875 --> 00:28:49,875
[instrumental music continues]

584
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:03,916
[shoe squeals]

585
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,500
[coughs]

586
00:29:08,583 --> 00:29:10,500
[instrumental music continues]

587
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,625
So, the... the bedrooms are upstairs.

588
00:29:33,208 --> 00:29:34,958
Not much else. Um...

589
00:29:35,458 --> 00:29:36,500
[inhales deeply]

590
00:29:36,583 --> 00:29:38,250
My mom's sewing room,

591
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,666
bedroom, linen closet.

592
00:29:41,958 --> 00:29:42,916
Um...

593
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,208
I can show you after we eat,

594
00:29:45,291 --> 00:29:46,458
- if you'd like.
- [chuckles]

595
00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:48,958
It's not fancy,

596
00:29:49,375 --> 00:29:50,541
as you can see.

597
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:52,583
It's nice. I like it.

598
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:54,041
- Yeah?
- [young woman] Yes.

599
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,000
Reminds me of the house I grew up in.

600
00:29:56,625 --> 00:29:57,750
[Jake inhales deeply]

601
00:29:57,833 --> 00:30:01,583
I suppose all farmhouses are alike.

602
00:30:03,666 --> 00:30:05,333
Like all happy families.

603
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:09,041
I'm not sure Tolstoy got that one right.

604
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:16,916
Happiness in a family
is as nuanced as unhappiness.

605
00:30:17,541 --> 00:30:19,333
Well, I think he was
talking about marriage...

606
00:30:19,416 --> 00:30:20,666
Ah, here they come!

607
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,625
I'll just get a fire going
in the meantime.

608
00:30:47,375 --> 00:30:48,500
[Jake lights match]

609
00:30:50,541 --> 00:30:52,583
[whispers] Your parents knew
we were coming, right?

610
00:30:52,666 --> 00:30:54,458
I mean, they invited us and all...

611
00:30:54,541 --> 00:30:58,791
Invitation sounds a little formal
for my family,

612
00:30:58,875 --> 00:31:00,458
but yeah, of course,
we communicated.

613
00:31:00,541 --> 00:31:01,791
[young woman] OK, cool.

614
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:02,958
[fire crackling]

615
00:31:03,958 --> 00:31:04,875
[young woman] Hmm.

616
00:31:05,791 --> 00:31:07,250
This fire feels good.

617
00:31:08,916 --> 00:31:09,916
Cozy.

618
00:31:11,166 --> 00:31:12,833
- What's in there?
- The basement.

619
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,375
[young woman] Oh.

620
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:15,666
I see.

621
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:20,041
We keep it closed off, mostly,
'cause old houses tend to be...

622
00:31:20,708 --> 00:31:21,541
drafty.

623
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:23,083
Right. [inhales]

624
00:31:25,541 --> 00:31:26,458
Anyway...

625
00:31:27,125 --> 00:31:28,541
the basement is unfinished.

626
00:31:29,416 --> 00:31:31,125
A hole in the ground, really.

627
00:31:31,208 --> 00:31:32,583
A hole in the ground?

628
00:31:33,166 --> 00:31:36,333
Just, water heater, washer and dryer,
stuff like that.

629
00:31:36,875 --> 00:31:39,000
We don't use it really for anything else.

630
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:43,000
- OK.
- So, it's a waste of space.

631
00:31:44,583 --> 00:31:46,083
I hate the basement, if you...

632
00:31:46,958 --> 00:31:47,958
really want to know.

633
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:49,833
You have intense feelings about it.

634
00:31:49,916 --> 00:31:51,208
[stammers] You...

635
00:31:51,291 --> 00:31:52,791
You know, when you're a kid,

636
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:55,708
uh, basements are scary.

637
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:58,666
Well, we didn't have one
growing up in an apartment,

638
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:02,208
but watching those scary movies,
you get the idea.

639
00:32:02,291 --> 00:32:03,125
[chuckles]

640
00:32:03,625 --> 00:32:05,791
[low voice]
Don't look down in the basement.

641
00:32:05,875 --> 00:32:07,125
[laughs]

642
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:08,958
Oh, whoa!

643
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:10,958
[both laughing]

644
00:32:11,708 --> 00:32:13,291
Exactly. [laughs]

645
00:32:13,375 --> 00:32:14,375
[young woman laughs]

646
00:32:15,458 --> 00:32:17,250
He's hiding in there. Shh.

647
00:32:19,166 --> 00:32:20,375
- Who?
- What?

648
00:32:21,875 --> 00:32:22,708
Um...

649
00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:24,916
What are those scratches on the door?

650
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,458
[Jake inhales]

651
00:32:26,541 --> 00:32:29,208
Dog. From the dog, mostly.

652
00:32:32,166 --> 00:32:33,125
I...

653
00:32:33,208 --> 00:32:34,125
I love dogs.

654
00:32:34,208 --> 00:32:35,041
[Jake chuckles]

655
00:32:35,666 --> 00:32:37,416
I didn't know your parents have a dog!

656
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,708
I usually can tell when there's a dog
in someone's house.

657
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,458
- Toys lying around, and...
- My folks are tidy.

658
00:32:42,541 --> 00:32:45,208
Well, where is it? What...
what kind? What's its name?

659
00:32:46,041 --> 00:32:48,125
So many questions. Uh, Jimmy.

660
00:32:49,208 --> 00:32:50,291
He's a border collie.

661
00:32:50,708 --> 00:32:52,625
- Probably outside, or...
- [gasps]

662
00:32:52,708 --> 00:32:55,416
Oh! Hi, Jimmy!

663
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,500
Hi!

664
00:32:56,583 --> 00:32:58,000
[Jimmy panting]

665
00:32:58,083 --> 00:32:59,958
Oh, he's all wet. [chuckles]

666
00:33:01,708 --> 00:33:03,250
[softly growling and whimpering]

667
00:33:03,333 --> 00:33:05,916
- That's...
- Ah! Here they come.

668
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,416
[laughing] Oh!

669
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,333
Oh!

670
00:33:08,833 --> 00:33:09,916
[smooches]

671
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,958
Aww!

672
00:33:11,041 --> 00:33:12,208
Was the drive OK?

673
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:13,250
Yeah, fine.

674
00:33:13,333 --> 00:33:14,166
[mother] Oh.

675
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:16,125
- So glad to meet you, Louisa.
- [young woman] Oh.

676
00:33:16,208 --> 00:33:18,958
[mother] Jake has told us
so much about you.

677
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:22,000
[young woman] Oh, he's told me so much
about both of you too. [chuckles]

678
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,083
Oh. And you came anyway?

679
00:33:24,166 --> 00:33:25,916
[laughing]

680
00:33:29,791 --> 00:33:30,625
Hi.

681
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:42,916
Well, let's eat. All the food
will be as cold as a witch's tit

682
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,333
in a brass brassiere.

683
00:33:44,416 --> 00:33:46,833
[laughing]

684
00:33:58,625 --> 00:34:01,333
- Oh, it smells great.
- [mother] I hope you're hungry.

685
00:34:01,416 --> 00:34:04,333
All homemade. Everything you see
on the table is from the farm.

686
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,291
[inhales]

687
00:34:10,541 --> 00:34:11,416
Looks lovely.

688
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,541
So... [exhales]

689
00:34:12,625 --> 00:34:14,333
Jake tells us you're a painter.

690
00:34:14,416 --> 00:34:16,458
Yes! Jake tells you correctly.

691
00:34:16,541 --> 00:34:18,250
I don't really know much about art,

692
00:34:18,333 --> 00:34:20,708
but I like pictures where you know
what you're looking at.

693
00:34:20,791 --> 00:34:23,375
What's it called? Uh, abstract.
I don't get that.

694
00:34:23,458 --> 00:34:27,500
I could do abstract. Smear some paint on,
what's it called?

695
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:31,041
Canvas. I think it's a con job
if you ask me.

696
00:34:31,458 --> 00:34:33,791
I like paintings
that look like photographs.

697
00:34:34,416 --> 00:34:37,708
I couldn't do that in a million years.
That is talent.

698
00:34:37,791 --> 00:34:43,708
Why... why not just take a photograph,
Dad, if you like photographs?

699
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:46,958
It's much quicker, and photographs look
exactly like photographs.

700
00:34:47,041 --> 00:34:50,250
I like photographs,
mostly sports photographs.

701
00:34:50,333 --> 00:34:52,250
[mother] What kind of paintings
do you make, Lucy?

702
00:34:54,041 --> 00:34:57,833
Uh, well, I-I'm not an abstract artist,
so that's in my favor.

703
00:34:57,916 --> 00:35:00,875
Good! You see, that's exactly my point.
You see? Good!

704
00:35:00,958 --> 00:35:02,750
I-I do mostly landscape.

705
00:35:03,541 --> 00:35:05,666
Like outside paintings?

706
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:08,000
Uh, yes! Mm-hmm. <i>Plein air.</i>

707
00:35:08,333 --> 00:35:10,583
Which is outdoor painting. [chuckles]

708
00:35:10,666 --> 00:35:14,500
I try to capture the feel
of light and atmosphere.

709
00:35:14,583 --> 00:35:15,541
That sounds lovely.

710
00:35:15,625 --> 00:35:17,416
- Jake used to paint too, of course.
- Mom!

711
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,750
- He worked really hard at it.
- Aww.

712
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,500
I didn't know that.

713
00:35:21,583 --> 00:35:23,083
- He was very good.
- [Jake] Mom.

714
00:35:23,166 --> 00:35:24,000
Aww.

715
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:31,625
I try to imbue my work with a sort of...

716
00:35:31,708 --> 00:35:32,708
interiority.

717
00:35:32,791 --> 00:35:34,583
Interiority. So you paint...

718
00:35:35,291 --> 00:35:37,000
- inside?
- [young woman] Well, inside my head.

719
00:35:37,083 --> 00:35:40,208
So a landscape would attempt to express
how I feel at that time.

720
00:35:40,291 --> 00:35:42,916
Lonely, joyous, worried, s-sad.

721
00:35:43,625 --> 00:35:45,083
That sounds very interesting.

722
00:35:45,916 --> 00:35:49,541
Like that painting of that girl,
sitting in a field, looking at a house.

723
00:35:49,625 --> 00:35:50,958
Christina's World. Wyeth.

724
00:35:51,041 --> 00:35:52,708
- Yes. Exactly.
- [laughing]

725
00:35:53,166 --> 00:35:54,375
But without people.

726
00:35:54,458 --> 00:35:55,375
Uh...

727
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:58,541
How can a picture of a field be sad

728
00:35:58,625 --> 00:36:01,708
without a sad person
looking sad in the field?

729
00:36:03,666 --> 00:36:05,333
That's an interesting problem.

730
00:36:05,416 --> 00:36:06,250
I...

731
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:07,708
Yeah, I-I-I-I...

732
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:09,416
I... I struggle with that.

733
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,333
[laughs]

734
00:36:10,416 --> 00:36:11,333
Uh...

735
00:36:11,416 --> 00:36:16,333
Well, I have some pictures of my work,
if you'd like to see them.

736
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:18,208
[wind whistling]

737
00:36:18,291 --> 00:36:20,333
Oh, yes!

738
00:36:20,416 --> 00:36:21,583
- Yeah?
- Yes?

739
00:36:21,666 --> 00:36:23,500
- [mother] Yes!
- [young woman] Yeah?

740
00:36:37,416 --> 00:36:38,250
Uh...

741
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:42,166
These here.

742
00:36:44,791 --> 00:36:45,666
[father] Mmm!

743
00:36:46,791 --> 00:36:47,833
Mmm.

744
00:36:47,916 --> 00:36:48,750
Mmm.

745
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:50,750
Ah.

746
00:36:53,958 --> 00:36:55,375
Mmm. Ah!

747
00:36:56,125 --> 00:36:57,916
Mmm. I mean, they're pretty,

748
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,750
but I don't see how it's supposed
to make me feel something

749
00:37:01,833 --> 00:37:04,583
if there's not a person in them
feeling something.

750
00:37:04,666 --> 00:37:07,750
If there's not a person in them
feeling sad or joyous

751
00:37:07,833 --> 00:37:09,708
or whatever other emotion you said.

752
00:37:10,958 --> 00:37:15,791
Well, m-maybe think of yourself
as the person looking out at the scene.

753
00:37:15,875 --> 00:37:17,458
I'd have to see me in them.

754
00:37:17,875 --> 00:37:20,083
Well, if you were there,
you wouldn't see yourself, right?

755
00:37:20,166 --> 00:37:22,541
Well, I would if I looked down.
I'm not a ghost.

756
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:24,125
- Yet.
- I can attest to that. [chuckles]

757
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:25,750
Especially in the bedroom.

758
00:37:25,833 --> 00:37:26,916
[giggling]

759
00:37:27,625 --> 00:37:30,500
[stammering] I mean, but if you were there

760
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:32,208
looking out at it without looking down,

761
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:34,333
you'd... you'd see the scene
and you'd feel something.

762
00:37:34,416 --> 00:37:37,000
Anything an environment makes you feel
is about you,

763
00:37:37,083 --> 00:37:38,666
not the environment, right?

764
00:37:39,208 --> 00:37:40,166
None of...

765
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:42,791
none of the feeling
is inherent to the place.

766
00:37:42,875 --> 00:37:44,750
[father] Uh, that's over my head, I guess.

767
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:48,083
They are pretty, though.
You're very talented. [chuckles]

768
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,333
- Thank you.
- I like the colors.

769
00:37:50,416 --> 00:37:51,500
Thanks.

770
00:37:51,958 --> 00:37:55,916
Psst, Jake, you didn't tell us
your girlfriend was so talented.

771
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,708
I did, actually.

772
00:37:57,791 --> 00:37:59,083
[laughing]

773
00:38:00,041 --> 00:38:02,125
Anyway, uh... [clears throat]

774
00:38:02,833 --> 00:38:04,083
I mean, sometimes I...

775
00:38:04,166 --> 00:38:05,250
I would've thought...

776
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:06,708
Mmm...

777
00:38:06,791 --> 00:38:07,625
Because...

778
00:38:08,083 --> 00:38:09,291
[wind whistling]

779
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:14,166
Uh, so...

780
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,458
[clears throat] Jake...

781
00:38:16,041 --> 00:38:19,166
tells me you're studying quantum psychics
at the university.

782
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:20,916
- Yes.
- Physics.

783
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,250
- Really?
- Yeah.

784
00:38:23,083 --> 00:38:25,083
That's unusual for a girl, isn't it?

785
00:38:25,666 --> 00:38:26,750
Yes, it is, actually.

786
00:38:26,833 --> 00:38:28,083
I'm just asking.

787
00:38:29,458 --> 00:38:32,666
[stammers] A little less so these days,
which I think is a good thing.

788
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:35,416
[mother] Well, after seventh grade,

789
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,708
I couldn't understand
what Jake was saying,

790
00:38:37,791 --> 00:38:41,708
so it's wonderful he has someone
he can share all his ideas with.

791
00:38:41,791 --> 00:38:47,166
Jake tells us there's been lots of famous
husband and wife physicists.

792
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:48,791
- Ooh! [laughs]
- Dad!

793
00:38:48,875 --> 00:38:49,833
[wind whistling]

794
00:38:49,916 --> 00:38:50,833
Yeah. [chuckles]

795
00:38:50,916 --> 00:38:53,208
[stammers] I guess there have been some.

796
00:38:53,583 --> 00:38:56,541
Uh, Pierre and Marie Curie
shared a Nobel Prize in physics.

797
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,375
Well, even I've heard of them.

798
00:38:58,458 --> 00:39:00,458
Well, I've heard of her anyway, radiation.

799
00:39:00,541 --> 00:39:02,333
- Uh, radioactivity.
- Radium.

800
00:39:02,416 --> 00:39:06,166
- Yes.
- I am so glad Jake has found someone.

801
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:07,458
[giggling]

802
00:39:07,541 --> 00:39:10,000
Won't you please tell us the story
of how you met?

803
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,750
Jake has refused.

804
00:39:11,833 --> 00:39:13,416
I love romantic meeting stories.

805
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,916
Like in<i> Forget Paris.</i>

806
00:39:15,416 --> 00:39:17,500
- Billy Crystal?
- I didn't like that movie.

807
00:39:17,583 --> 00:39:20,083
Billy Crystal is a nancy.

808
00:39:22,416 --> 00:39:23,333
Um...

809
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:26,125
[wind whistling]

810
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,750
So... [laughs]

811
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:29,791
Uh...

812
00:39:29,875 --> 00:39:33,583
I went with a friend
to a bar near campus, and...

813
00:39:34,291 --> 00:39:35,708
it turned out to be trivia night.

814
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:38,375
Oh, I love this so far!
Jake is crazy about trivia!

815
00:39:38,458 --> 00:39:40,541
We used to play
the Genius Edition of the...

816
00:39:40,625 --> 00:39:42,333
- We used to play the Genius Edition...
- Genus.

817
00:39:42,416 --> 00:39:44,208
- We used to play the Genius Edition...
- Genus!

818
00:39:44,291 --> 00:39:45,916
[mother] …of Trivial Pursuit. What?

819
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,208
It's Genus Edition.

820
00:39:47,291 --> 00:39:52,000
Oh, I always thought the word was genius.
I've been saying it wrong all these years.

821
00:39:52,083 --> 00:39:53,958
Goes to show, I'm no genus!

822
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:56,083
[both laughing]

823
00:39:57,291 --> 00:39:58,500
That's a good one.

824
00:39:58,583 --> 00:39:59,958
[Jake] No, no, no.

825
00:40:00,041 --> 00:40:00,958
[wind whistling]

826
00:40:01,041 --> 00:40:02,000
Genus is not...

827
00:40:02,083 --> 00:40:04,041
the same as genius.

828
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:05,958
A genus is a category.

829
00:40:06,041 --> 00:40:07,916
I always thought
it was the Genius Edition.

830
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,041
I told everyone he knew every answer
in the Genius Edition.

831
00:40:11,125 --> 00:40:13,250
I was very proud of that. [laughs]

832
00:40:13,916 --> 00:40:16,416
- Why didn't we get the Genius...
- [yells] There is no...

833
00:40:16,791 --> 00:40:18,666
[Jake breathing heavily]

834
00:40:19,541 --> 00:40:22,458
- Genius Edition.
- OK.

835
00:40:25,583 --> 00:40:27,333
[wind howling]

836
00:40:39,666 --> 00:40:41,375
[inhales] So, Jake was
with his trivia team,

837
00:40:41,458 --> 00:40:43,708
and my friend and I
found an empty table near him,

838
00:40:43,791 --> 00:40:45,166
and I was watching him.

839
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:48,541
- Because you thought he was cute!
- [young woman laughing] Yeah, I did.

840
00:40:48,625 --> 00:40:52,791
And he was very serious about the game,
which I found, I don't know, charming.

841
00:40:53,291 --> 00:40:55,416
And... Oh, his team was called...

842
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,333
- Brezhnev's Eyebrows.
- Brezhnev's Eyebrows, right.

843
00:40:58,416 --> 00:41:00,375
- [inhales]
- [young woman] I asked who Brezhnev was,

844
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,750
basically so I could say something to him.

845
00:41:02,833 --> 00:41:06,708
And he told me
that Brezhnev was a Soviet engineer.

846
00:41:06,791 --> 00:41:10,958
[stammering] And a general of the...

847
00:41:11,041 --> 00:41:14,083
- Uh, the section head of...
- Secretary of the Communist Party.

848
00:41:14,541 --> 00:41:15,875
During the age of starvation.

849
00:41:15,958 --> 00:41:17,458
- Stagnation.
- [young woman] Stagnation.

850
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:19,333
Anyway, those team names
drive me nuts usually.

851
00:41:19,416 --> 00:41:21,583
They all have the most teams show-offy.

852
00:41:21,666 --> 00:41:24,458
But I don't know, it didn't
bother me so much with Jake.

853
00:41:24,541 --> 00:41:26,708
I guess I didn't let it
because I thought he was cute.

854
00:41:26,791 --> 00:41:30,000
Aw, he is cute, isn't he? [laughs]

855
00:41:30,083 --> 00:41:33,541
So I-I-I was trying to get up the nerve
to talk to him, because...

856
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:35,833
even though he looked over at me
more than once,

857
00:41:35,916 --> 00:41:37,875
it was clear he wasn't gonna say anything.

858
00:41:37,958 --> 00:41:42,208
[stammers] I thought you said
you were talking about Brezhnev?

859
00:41:42,916 --> 00:41:44,541
[wind howling]

860
00:41:48,666 --> 00:41:49,625
Uh...

861
00:41:52,833 --> 00:41:55,000
Yes, that's true.

862
00:41:55,833 --> 00:41:57,958
But we didn't talk anymore after that,

863
00:41:58,041 --> 00:41:59,291
I guess is what I meant.

864
00:41:59,375 --> 00:42:00,833
Oh.

865
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:12,208
So I said something stupid, like,
"You guys seem to be doing well."

866
00:42:12,291 --> 00:42:13,958
[laughs]

867
00:42:14,041 --> 00:42:14,916
[giggles]

868
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:19,250
And I had to practically yell it,
it was so noisy.

869
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:22,750
And Jake... Jake raised his glass
and went, "Well, yeah,

870
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:24,458
well, we're helpfully fortified."

871
00:42:24,541 --> 00:42:26,666
And I laughed, which broke the ice,

872
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:29,125
and I think he was egged on
by my laughing,

873
00:42:29,208 --> 00:42:33,500
'cause he went on to tell me
that he was a cruc...

874
00:42:33,583 --> 00:42:34,958
- Verbalist.
- [young woman] Verbalist.

875
00:42:35,041 --> 00:42:36,583
And I didn't know what that meant.

876
00:42:36,666 --> 00:42:38,791
But I-I didn't want to admit that,
so I just said,

877
00:42:38,875 --> 00:42:39,708
- "Cool."
- Cool.

878
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:42,208
And he was showing off again,
and poorly,

879
00:42:42,291 --> 00:42:45,500
and I thought, "This guy is awkward.
He has no game at all."

880
00:42:45,583 --> 00:42:49,041
[inhales] And there was something
sort of appealing about that.

881
00:42:49,125 --> 00:42:50,666
[wind whistling]

882
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:51,916
But then he kept going.

883
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:57,708
And he told me that he wanted
his team name to be Ipseity,

884
00:42:58,166 --> 00:42:59,625
and I was like, "Ugh."

885
00:42:59,708 --> 00:43:01,125
You didn't like him anymore?

886
00:43:04,375 --> 00:43:05,250
No.

887
00:43:09,083 --> 00:43:10,041
I did.

888
00:43:10,625 --> 00:43:11,500
[mother chuckles]

889
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:13,958
I just wanted that stuff to stop.

890
00:43:14,041 --> 00:43:14,875
So I told him,

891
00:43:14,958 --> 00:43:17,833
"You know I don't know that word.
Why don't you just cut the crap?"

892
00:43:17,916 --> 00:43:19,750
[laughs]

893
00:43:19,833 --> 00:43:22,125
And he said something like,
"I'm an asshole."

894
00:43:22,208 --> 00:43:23,916
[laughs]

895
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,041
[laughing hysterically]

896
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:30,791
[laughs]

897
00:43:32,416 --> 00:43:34,333
"I'm not very good at talking to people,

898
00:43:34,416 --> 00:43:36,875
and ipseity is just another word
for selfhood."

899
00:43:36,958 --> 00:43:41,000
[inhales] Anyway, after that, he talked
like a normal person, and he was funny.

900
00:43:41,083 --> 00:43:43,791
And I could see he wanted to ask
for my number,

901
00:43:43,875 --> 00:43:45,000
but was shy.

902
00:43:45,625 --> 00:43:47,708
And I was getting up to go.

903
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:49,875
My girlfriend wanted to leave.

904
00:43:49,958 --> 00:43:50,958
And Jake...

905
00:43:51,041 --> 00:43:52,708
blurted out, could he have my number?

906
00:43:52,791 --> 00:43:54,166
- Oh!
- [young woman laughs]

907
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:56,708
There you go... Jake.

908
00:43:56,791 --> 00:43:58,291
- [young woman laughs]
- It's about time.

909
00:43:59,958 --> 00:44:01,458
And the rest was history.

910
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:02,958
That was like...

911
00:44:04,333 --> 00:44:05,666
six weeks ago?

912
00:44:06,125 --> 00:44:07,250
God, feels longer.

913
00:44:08,166 --> 00:44:09,791
[exhales]

914
00:44:10,458 --> 00:44:13,083
Feels like forever, in a way.
[slight chuckle]

915
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:14,583
I can't...

916
00:44:16,666 --> 00:44:18,750
I can't even remember how long ago it is.

917
00:44:19,166 --> 00:44:20,833
[wind howling]

918
00:44:20,916 --> 00:44:22,208

923
00:44:51,041 --> 00:44:51,875
<i>Really?</i>

924
00:44:52,583 --> 00:44:53,541
[man grunts softly]

925
00:44:54,375 --> 00:44:55,833
<i>That's Nimrod. </i>[exhales]

- Hey.</i>

928
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:04,333
<i>So are you folks ready to order,
or can I answer questions about the menu?</i>

929
00:45:04,416 --> 00:45:06,833
<i>- How is the Santa Fe burger?
- Very popular.</i>

930
00:45:07,125 --> 00:45:09,041
<i>OK, so, uh, which do you prefer,</i>

931
00:45:09,125 --> 00:45:12,250
<i>the Santa Fe burger or the Natchez burger?</i>

932
00:45:12,333 --> 00:45:14,791
<i>Hmm, that's a tough one.
They're both really, really good.</i>

933

936
00:45:22,875 --> 00:45:26,250
<i>about this amazing woman in front of you
is that she's not a waitress.</i>

937

- [Yvonne] <i>Can you please leave?</i>
- [man] <i>She is a waitress.</i>

938
00:45:28,583 --> 00:45:31,041
<i>But only to put herself through school
so that she can become</i>

939
00:45:31,125 --> 00:45:33,333
<i>- an animal rights lawyer.
- OK.</i>

940
00:45:33,416 --> 00:45:35,791
<i>No, not a crumb of meat or dairy
has crossed her lips</i>

941
00:45:35,875 --> 00:45:37,208
<i>since she was five years old.</i>

942
00:45:37,291 --> 00:45:40,958
<i>And she realized that a...
that a hamburger is just a ground-up cow.</i>

955
00:46:23,916 --> 00:46:24,791

<i>Idiot.</i>

957
00:46:41,583 --> 00:46:43,416
[young woman] Well, that was lovely.

958
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,958
- We gotta get on the road.
- [mother] Jake was always a good boy.

959
00:46:46,041 --> 00:46:48,958
He was even awarded a diligence pin
at school, you remember?

960
00:46:49,041 --> 00:46:51,041
- [young woman] Still working on that?
- [father] Nah.

961
00:46:51,125 --> 00:46:53,125
Diligence. At eight, can you believe that?

962
00:46:53,208 --> 00:46:56,541
It was quite a thing. His father and I
never got awarded any such pin at eight.

963
00:46:56,625 --> 00:46:58,166
- [father] At any age.
- True enough.

964
00:46:58,250 --> 00:46:59,250
At no age.

965
00:46:59,333 --> 00:47:02,500
I won a bunch of sports trophies,
but never a diligence trophy.

966
00:47:02,583 --> 00:47:04,875
I don't imagine I knew the word diligence
at eight!

967
00:47:04,958 --> 00:47:07,125
But Jake knew it. You knew.

968
00:47:07,208 --> 00:47:08,333
Jake knew.

969
00:47:08,666 --> 00:47:10,583
Jake knew. Remember how excited you were

970
00:47:10,666 --> 00:47:12,125
- about that diligence pin?
- [Jake] No.

971
00:47:12,208 --> 00:47:14,416
- [laughing] He wore it to school.
- I didn't.

972
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:17,000
He did, every day. You did!

973
00:47:17,083 --> 00:47:20,208
No, I was disappointed.
I wanted the acumen pin.

974
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:21,541
Diligence...

975
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,375
is an also ran.

976
00:47:23,458 --> 00:47:25,750
"You there, you worked very hard,
you're not very bright,

977
00:47:25,833 --> 00:47:27,458
but we're impressed
that you tried anyway."

978
00:47:27,541 --> 00:47:28,833
Oh, don't be sour.

979
00:47:28,916 --> 00:47:31,875
It was a lovely pin, sweetheart.

980
00:47:31,958 --> 00:47:33,416
Jakey.

981
00:47:34,875 --> 00:47:35,708
Dessert?

982
00:47:36,166 --> 00:47:38,875
I made Jake's favorite chocolate cake.

983
00:47:38,958 --> 00:47:40,541

984
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:43,625
Lovely.

[deep breath]

986
00:47:45,125 --> 00:47:47,291
Of course, I never turn down
anything chocolate.

987
00:47:47,375 --> 00:47:48,291
Lovely.

00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:59,916
I'll serve dessert in the sitting room.

991
00:48:00,958 --> 00:48:02,791
That's from <i>My Fair Lady.</i>

992
00:48:03,416 --> 00:48:06,500
- [mother] That was you! Yes!
- [father] She said he was a nancy.

[mother] You've been saying that one
for years!

- Oh, you cannot keep doing this!

995
00:48:12,208 --> 00:48:13,833
[young woman] You seem so quiet.

996
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:16,041
You OK?

997
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:21,083

They're very nice.

Very nice parents.

1000
00:48:26,166 --> 00:48:27,541
You chose well, my friend.

Of course.

1005

They love you a lot.

Mm-mm. [chuckles]

Even though it's well past yule. [laughs]

1034
00:49:56,208 --> 00:49:59,291
Reminds me of when Jake
used to suck his thumb.

1035
00:49:59,375 --> 00:50:01,583
Well past the age
when he should've stopped.

1036
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:05,208
He'd say, "Yule, yule, yule..." [laughing]

1037
00:50:05,291 --> 00:50:06,250
As he sucked it.

1038
00:50:06,333 --> 00:50:09,208
Yule log. Kinda looks like thumb!

I've been having problems with my ears.

1048
00:50:24,083 --> 00:50:27,625
Just in case anyone is wondering why
I keep pulling at my ears all night long.

1049
00:50:27,708 --> 00:50:29,041
More than a problem.

1050
00:50:29,125 --> 00:50:30,541
[grunts] Tinnitus.

1051
00:50:30,625 --> 00:50:32,375
It is what it is, as they say.

1052
00:50:32,458 --> 00:50:33,541
What is tinnitus?

1053
00:50:33,625 --> 00:50:35,416
Not very much fun is what.

1054
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,125
Not very much fun.

1055
00:50:37,583 --> 00:50:39,208
But shit happens, as they say.

1056
00:50:39,291 --> 00:50:40,166
[mother chuckles]

1057
00:50:42,125 --> 00:50:44,041
I hear a kind of buzzing in my ears.

1058
00:50:44,125 --> 00:50:46,041
Well, not so much a buzzing,
more of a hiss.

1059
00:50:46,125 --> 00:50:47,083
Well, more of a...

1060
00:50:47,625 --> 00:50:48,500
whisper.

1061
00:50:49,833 --> 00:50:51,041
Oh, always?

1062
00:50:51,458 --> 00:50:52,291
Yes!

1063
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:55,333
As if I'm constantly being whispered to.

1064
00:50:55,958 --> 00:50:57,666
[makes hissing sound]

1065
00:51:03,583 --> 00:51:06,291
Maybe it's sharing the secrets
of the universe with me.

1066
00:51:08,333 --> 00:51:09,541
But I can't tell.

1067
00:51:09,625 --> 00:51:10,916
[uneasy chuckling]

1068
00:51:12,625 --> 00:51:14,583
Maybe it's giving me stock market tips.

1069
00:51:14,666 --> 00:51:15,875
[laughs]

1070
00:51:15,958 --> 00:51:17,458
Oh, we'd be rich!

1071
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:18,916
[cell phone rings]

1072
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,125
Sorry, sorry.

1073
00:51:20,208 --> 00:51:22,666
I... I thought it had been turned off.

1074
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:24,250
- [cell phone ringing]
- Um...

1075
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:26,875
- See my glasses?
- Here you are.

1076
00:51:28,833 --> 00:51:30,375
[cell phone ringing]

1077
00:51:31,916 --> 00:51:33,583
It's just a friend.

1078
00:51:33,666 --> 00:51:35,833
- Her friend calls a lot.
- [mother] Well, you can take it.

1079
00:51:35,916 --> 00:51:37,583
You should take it.
We won't think it rude.

1080
00:51:37,666 --> 00:51:39,125
No, it's OK. It's not important.

1081
00:51:39,208 --> 00:51:41,583
You don't know. It might be.
It's a blizzard out there.

1082
00:51:41,666 --> 00:51:43,625
- She might be stranded.
- It's OK.

1083
00:51:43,708 --> 00:51:46,166
Is it a blizzard now?
We... We don't want to get stuck.

1084
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:48,166
- Stuck? Stuck?
- It's OK. I've got the chains.

1085
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:49,875
I've... I've got to work early tomorrow.

1086
00:51:49,958 --> 00:51:51,208
Oh, you put the chains on?

1087
00:51:51,291 --> 00:51:53,750
No, not yet, but they're in...
they're in the bed.

1088
00:51:53,833 --> 00:51:55,583
Chains should make it fine.

1089
00:51:55,666 --> 00:51:56,666
What? I'm sorry.

1090
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:58,583
- The chains.
- Oh, God.

1091
00:51:59,208 --> 00:52:02,083
- [whispering] The whispers, I call them.
- [father] The night is the worst.

1092
00:52:02,166 --> 00:52:03,500
- [mother] What is?
- [father] Night!

1093
00:52:03,583 --> 00:52:04,958
Oh, night is the worst.

1094
00:52:05,416 --> 00:52:06,666
I don't sleep much anymore.

1095
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:09,208
Oh, that sounds very difficult. I'm sorry.

1096
00:52:09,291 --> 00:52:11,041
- Sorry?
- I just said I'm sorry!

1097
00:52:11,125 --> 00:52:11,958
Oh. [laughs]

1098
00:52:12,041 --> 00:52:13,375
We're both saying sorry!

1099
00:52:13,458 --> 00:52:15,041
[laughing]

1100
00:52:16,208 --> 00:52:18,958
- You should take your call though.
- It could be an emergency.

1101
00:52:19,041 --> 00:52:19,875
It's fine.

1102
00:52:20,333 --> 00:52:21,208
I-I-I-I...

1103
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:25,000
- I know what she's calling about.
- You should at least listen to the message

1104
00:52:25,083 --> 00:52:25,916
OK!

1105
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:28,375
[groans]

1106
00:52:28,916 --> 00:52:30,041
Sure. [chuckles]

1107
00:52:36,458 --> 00:52:38,416
[man's voice] <i>There's only one question</i>
<i>to resolve.</i>

1108
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:40,708
<i>I'm scared. I feel a little crazy.</i>

1109
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:42,125
<i>I'm not lucid. How...</i>

1110
00:52:42,208 --> 00:52:43,583
<i>The assumptions are right.</i>

1111
00:52:43,666 --> 00:52:45,083
<i>I can feel my fear growing.</i>

1112
00:52:45,166 --> 00:52:47,958
<i>Now is the time for the answer,
just one question.</i>

1113
00:52:48,041 --> 00:52:49,416
<i>One question to answer.</i>

1114
00:52:50,416 --> 00:52:51,708
[wind whistling]

1115
00:52:52,458 --> 00:52:53,333
[sighs]

1116
00:52:53,416 --> 00:52:54,666
- She's fine.
- Eh?

1117
00:52:55,166 --> 00:52:56,958
Wh... what did she want?

1118
00:52:57,041 --> 00:52:59,208
Oh, she was just calling to say hi.

1119
00:52:59,291 --> 00:53:00,250
[mother] How nice.

1120
00:53:00,333 --> 00:53:01,666
Friends are important.

1121
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:05,958
Jake never really had a lot of them
growing up. Or even after.

1122
00:53:07,125 --> 00:53:08,583
Remember your 50th birthday?

1123
00:53:08,666 --> 00:53:10,625
- Twentieth.
- [mother] What did I say?

1124
00:53:10,708 --> 00:53:12,125
- Fiftieth.
- [Jake] Fiftieth.

1125
00:53:12,208 --> 00:53:13,666
Oh. [laughs]

1126
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:15,625
Goodness, where is my brain?

1127
00:53:15,708 --> 00:53:16,750
[laughing]

1128
00:53:16,833 --> 00:53:18,208
- [wind howling]
- [door shaking]

1129
00:53:18,291 --> 00:53:19,125
Anyway.

1130
00:53:20,916 --> 00:53:22,208
Friends can be helpful.

1131
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:24,791
Hmm. That's what I've always found.

1132
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:27,916
'Cause life can be difficult.

1133
00:53:29,083 --> 00:53:30,208
On a farm.

1134
00:53:30,291 --> 00:53:33,875
Doesn't get any easier
as it trudges along, I'll say that.

1135
00:53:35,041 --> 00:53:36,916
- What?
- [father] Doesn't get any easier.

1136
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,583
- [loudly] What doesn't?
- [yells] Life!

1137
00:53:38,666 --> 00:53:41,916
Oh, no, it doesn't.
It's basically a fast train to hell.

1138
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,166
For God's sake, Mom!

1139
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:46,208
All right, all right, yes.
I'm overstating it. I agree.

1140
00:53:47,375 --> 00:53:48,708
It's a fast train to heck!

1141
00:53:48,791 --> 00:53:50,875
[mother and father laughing hysterically]

1142
00:53:54,375 --> 00:53:56,500
[mother continues laughing]

1143
00:53:56,583 --> 00:53:58,208
[trailing off as in pain]

1144
00:54:05,458 --> 00:54:07,416
Your mother was always very funny.

1145
00:54:08,041 --> 00:54:09,333
[mother breathes shakily]

1146
00:54:09,416 --> 00:54:10,916
It's what I loved about her.

1147
00:54:12,291 --> 00:54:13,250
I think it's the...

1148
00:54:14,166 --> 00:54:16,250
the first thing that I fell in love with.

1149
00:54:18,958 --> 00:54:22,333
Kind of... faded as she got older.

1150
00:54:24,083 --> 00:54:25,833
Wears you down, I guess. [chuckles]

1151
00:54:26,958 --> 00:54:28,541
It's not so funny anymore.

1152
00:54:32,125 --> 00:54:33,416
I miss her terribly.

1153
00:54:34,791 --> 00:54:35,625
Yeah.

1154
00:54:36,125 --> 00:54:37,208
[wind whispering]

1155
00:54:47,166 --> 00:54:48,250
So, Lucia...

1156
00:54:49,041 --> 00:54:50,708
is studying gerontology.

1157
00:54:51,833 --> 00:54:53,333
Oh, really?

1158
00:54:53,416 --> 00:54:55,250
Oh, how fascinating.

1159
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:57,166
Oh, fascinating.

1160
00:54:58,875 --> 00:54:59,708
Yes.

1161
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:04,708
I've always been interested
in the problems associated with aging.

1162
00:55:05,375 --> 00:55:08,875
I think our society has an almost
repulsed relationship to the aged.

1163
00:55:08,958 --> 00:55:11,750
Which is eminently foolish,
seeing that it's an inevitable and natural

1164
00:55:11,833 --> 00:55:14,000
part of the life cycle
of all living things.

1165
00:55:15,875 --> 00:55:18,000
Not to mention it's terribly unkind.

1166
00:55:19,083 --> 00:55:19,916
Oh.

1167
00:55:21,125 --> 00:55:22,333
How interesting.

1168
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:24,083
And compassionate.

1169
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:26,875
Oh, we've gotta keep her, Jake.

1170
00:55:26,958 --> 00:55:29,083
Oh, how kind she is.

1171
00:55:29,166 --> 00:55:30,083
[laughs]

1172
00:55:30,166 --> 00:55:31,375
[wind howling]

1173
00:55:34,208 --> 00:55:35,208
Boy, it's, uh...

1174
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:38,916
It's looking pretty bad out there.

1175
00:55:39,791 --> 00:55:42,291
I don't know, Jake,
I-I think we should probably...

1176
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:44,583
[wind howling]

1177
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:54,083
Jake?

1178
00:55:57,833 --> 00:55:58,708
Jake?

1179
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:01,083
- Jake?
- [Jake] What?

1180
00:56:01,166 --> 00:56:02,833
[young woman]
I-I-I-I think we should go.

1181
00:56:02,916 --> 00:56:04,125
It's looking pretty bad.

1182
00:56:06,125 --> 00:56:07,333
[Jake] I have chains!

1183
00:56:07,416 --> 00:56:08,416
[rattling]

1184
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:10,875
[softly growling and whimpering]

1185
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:14,833
Where are you?

1186
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:16,958
- [Jake] Upstairs.
- I'm coming up.

1187
00:56:19,916 --> 00:56:21,041
Just letting you know.

1188
00:56:30,708 --> 00:56:32,500
[wind howling]

1189
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:51,125
Jake?

1190
00:56:57,875 --> 00:56:59,541
[wind howling intensifies]

1191
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:04,625
Jake?

1192
00:57:06,166 --> 00:57:07,041
Where are you?

1193
00:57:13,333 --> 00:57:14,166
Jake?

1194
00:57:15,291 --> 00:57:16,708
[door creaks open]

1195
00:58:14,416 --> 00:58:16,375
[young woman] <i>"Coming home is terrible.</i>

1200
00:58:30,041 --> 00:58:31,583
Sorry, you...

1201
00:58:31,666 --> 00:58:32,541
you scared me.

1202
00:58:32,625 --> 00:58:34,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:58:37,458 --> 00:58:38,291
This is...

1205
00:58:39,208 --> 00:58:41,666
Jake's childhood bedroom.

1206
00:58:43,666 --> 00:58:44,500
Yeah.

1207
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:46,250
Yeah, I-I...

1208
00:58:46,333 --> 00:58:47,916
I saw the sign on the door.

1209
00:58:49,083 --> 00:58:50,166
Oh, that.

1210
00:58:51,875 --> 00:58:53,416
How can I explain that?

1211
00:58:53,833 --> 00:58:56,041
My memory is going, um...

1212
00:58:56,125 --> 00:58:58,500
Early signs of, uh...

1213
00:58:59,916 --> 00:59:00,750
[sighs]

1214
00:59:01,666 --> 00:59:02,666
Uh...

1215
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:07,166
Alzheimer's?

1216
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:09,875
Dementia?

1217
00:59:11,583 --> 00:59:13,875
- Lewy bodies...
- Yeah, I think that's it.

1218
00:59:15,333 --> 00:59:16,625
We've taken to...

1219
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:19,250
labeling things

1220
00:59:19,666 --> 00:59:24,166
around the home,
you'll see labels all over the house.

1221
00:59:25,583 --> 00:59:26,833
I haven't noticed.

1222
00:59:30,083 --> 00:59:31,750
You will notice.

1223
00:59:32,416 --> 00:59:36,083
I'm sorry to hear that y-you're...

1224
00:59:36,166 --> 00:59:37,541
That's OK.

1225
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:39,833
Truth is...

1226
00:59:40,583 --> 00:59:43,000
I'm looking forward
to when it gets very bad

1227
00:59:43,083 --> 00:59:45,833
and I don't have to remember
that I can't remember!

1228
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:46,916
[laughs]

1229
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,375
[mother cackling]

1230
00:59:49,583 --> 00:59:50,416
[father chuckles]

1231
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:52,083
Seems that that'll be a...

1232
00:59:52,958 --> 00:59:55,291
better way to, um...

1233
00:59:55,958 --> 00:59:58,083
Oh, come on. [chuckles]

1234
01:00:01,125 --> 01:00:04,000
- Yeah.
- They say that every cloud has a...

1235
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:05,375
[inhales deeply]

1236
01:00:05,458 --> 01:00:06,291
[sighs]

1237
01:00:06,375 --> 01:00:09,916
- A silver...
- Silver! Ah, that's it, exactly. Silver.

1238
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:14,291
They say that every cloud has a silver,
and, uh...

1239
01:00:14,375 --> 01:00:16,000
Well, I believe that to be true.

1240
01:00:19,875 --> 01:00:20,708
Oh.

1241
01:00:21,125 --> 01:00:22,708
This is Jake's old room.

1242
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:27,541
You two can stay in here tonight
if you want.

1243
01:00:27,625 --> 01:00:31,500
His mother and I aren't old fashioned
about that kind of thing.

1244
01:00:31,583 --> 01:00:33,250
Fucking and whatnot.

1245
01:00:33,666 --> 01:00:35,791
Oh, I.. I... I have to get home tonight.

1246
01:00:35,875 --> 01:00:37,541
I have work in... in the morning.

1247
01:00:37,625 --> 01:00:38,875
I know this bed

1248
01:00:39,833 --> 01:00:42,166
looks a bit small for two, um...

1249
01:00:43,125 --> 01:00:43,958
Oh, come on.

1250
01:00:44,041 --> 01:00:46,083
Uh, uh, grown-ups.

1251
01:00:46,166 --> 01:00:49,833
It's a child's bed, after all.
Not even for twin children.

1252
01:00:50,208 --> 01:00:53,625
Just for one child. I'm sure
for a single night you could make do.

1253
01:00:54,041 --> 01:00:56,750
That's very generous of you, but I...
I-I do have to...

1254
01:00:56,833 --> 01:00:59,500
I imagine you won't be doing
any fucking in this bed.

1255
01:01:00,458 --> 01:01:03,250
Not really made for fucking.
It's a child's bed.

1256
01:01:03,333 --> 01:01:05,208
Just for one child, not two.

1257
01:01:05,291 --> 01:01:06,125
Right.

1258
01:01:06,208 --> 01:01:09,625
Sure I can find
one of my wife's old, um...

1259
01:01:11,208 --> 01:01:12,125
Oh.

1260
01:01:12,208 --> 01:01:13,041
[chuckles]

1261
01:01:14,125 --> 01:01:16,625
Things for you to wear for tonight.

1262
01:01:16,708 --> 01:01:18,750
Might have to dig through some trunks.

1263
01:01:19,666 --> 01:01:23,500
Sure I can find one of my wife's
old things for you to wear.

1264
01:01:24,458 --> 01:01:26,125
For tonight. Oh, look, there's...

1265
01:01:26,583 --> 01:01:29,666
Jake's old room.

1266
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:30,583
[chuckles]

1267
01:01:31,083 --> 01:01:31,916
[groans]

1268
01:01:37,208 --> 01:01:38,041
[gasps]

1269
01:01:41,208 --> 01:01:42,541
[fire crackling]

1270
01:01:47,333 --> 01:01:48,833
[mother groaning]

1271
01:01:52,958 --> 01:01:53,916
[young woman] Jake.

1272
01:01:56,750 --> 01:01:59,625
[weakly] Oh, it's the girlfriend.

1273
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:01,416
Open up.

1274
01:02:02,375 --> 01:02:04,291
Jake, the snow. I need to leave.

1275
01:02:04,375 --> 01:02:09,958
I've told him over and over
it's time for him to leave!

1276
01:02:10,041 --> 01:02:11,916
Mom, you need to eat!

1277
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,250
I'll be down in a minute.

1278
01:02:16,916 --> 01:02:17,750
Mom!

1279
01:02:19,125 --> 01:02:21,958
Jake's always been a good boy.

1280
01:02:22,041 --> 01:02:22,875
Mom.

1281
01:02:23,291 --> 01:02:24,583
[mother] Diligent.

1282
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:27,083
[groans]

1283
01:02:27,166 --> 01:02:29,000
He won a pin.

1284
01:02:29,416 --> 01:02:35,458
Maybe not as naturally talented
as some of the other students,

1285
01:02:35,541 --> 01:02:36,375
but...

1286
01:02:37,041 --> 01:02:40,375
he worked so hard.

1287
01:02:42,041 --> 01:02:44,958
And that's even more impressive.

1288
01:02:47,375 --> 01:02:48,666
Being a genus...

1289
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:50,041
Genius, Mom.

1290
01:02:50,125 --> 01:02:51,375
[mother, softly] Genius.

1291
01:02:53,166 --> 01:02:55,458
The luck of the draw, really.

1292
01:02:57,375 --> 01:03:00,875
The genetic lottery, as they say.

1293
01:03:02,666 --> 01:03:06,958
But to do as well as Jake did

1294
01:03:07,041 --> 01:03:12,458
with no special talent or abilities...

1295
01:03:12,833 --> 01:03:14,666
Oh. [breathing heavily]

1296
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:18,250
That's much more impressive.

1297
01:03:19,333 --> 01:03:20,625
Mm...

1298
01:03:20,708 --> 01:03:21,666
[young woman] Yes.

1299
01:03:22,208 --> 01:03:23,666
- Maybe you should...
- [yells] Soon!

1300
01:03:25,416 --> 01:03:26,250
OK.

1301
01:03:27,125 --> 01:03:30,333
We will leave soon.

1302
01:03:31,833 --> 01:03:33,416
Let me just finish up here.

1303
01:03:40,333 --> 01:03:41,583
[wind howling]

1304
01:03:41,666 --> 01:03:43,416
[grunting]

1305
01:03:46,458 --> 01:03:48,041
[grunting and groaning]

1306
01:03:52,083 --> 01:03:53,416
[wind howling intensifies]

1307
01:03:56,333 --> 01:03:57,208
[Jake] Mom?

1308
01:03:58,333 --> 01:04:01,166
[young woman] I'm impressed
with your attentiveness to your mom.

1309
01:04:01,583 --> 01:04:02,666
It's rare.

1310
01:04:03,375 --> 01:04:05,333
We tend to warehouse our elderly.

1311
01:04:08,416 --> 01:04:11,083
It's really special
how devoted a son you are.

1312
01:04:11,166 --> 01:04:14,000
I'm glad to hear you say that.
That makes me feel better.

1313
01:04:15,625 --> 01:04:17,083
Sometimes it...

1314
01:04:18,458 --> 01:04:22,166
feels like no one sees
the good things you do.

1315
01:04:22,250 --> 01:04:24,041
[wind howling]

1316
01:04:24,125 --> 01:04:25,541
Like you're just alone.

1317
01:04:31,625 --> 01:04:32,791
[whispers] I see it.

1318
01:04:40,083 --> 01:04:41,500
I'll wait downstairs.

1319
01:04:42,333 --> 01:04:43,500
Give you some privacy.

1320
01:04:48,875 --> 01:04:52,875
I don't want to live in a warehouse.

1321
01:04:53,416 --> 01:04:55,875
[young woman] <i>I should end this.</i>
<i>Just end it.</i>

1322
01:04:56,250 --> 01:04:57,791
<i>I just make a clean break.</i>

1323
01:04:58,166 --> 01:05:00,750
<i>No lingering,
no waiting for things to get better.</i>

1324
01:05:01,375 --> 01:05:02,833
<i>You can only wait so long.</i>

1325
01:05:03,333 --> 01:05:05,916
<i>I don't even know who I am
in this whole thing anymore,</i>

1326
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,875
<i>where I stop and Jake starts.</i>

1327
01:05:08,416 --> 01:05:12,666
<i>I'm a pinball. My emotional state
is bouncing all over the place.</i>

1328
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:15,750
<i>Jake needs to see me
as someone who sees him.</i>

1329
01:05:15,833 --> 01:05:18,750
<i>He needs to be seen,
and he needs to be seen with approval.</i>

1330
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:21,666
<i>Like that's my purpose
in all this, in life.</i>

1331
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:24,250
<i>To approve of Jake, to keep him going.</i>

1332
01:05:24,333 --> 01:05:27,333
<i>And he needs to see me as someone
whose approval of him is validated</i>

1333
01:05:27,416 --> 01:05:28,958
<i>because I'm approved of by others.</i>

1334
01:05:29,041 --> 01:05:31,000
<i>"Look at my girlfriend,
look at what I won.</i>

1335
01:05:31,083 --> 01:05:33,666
<i>She's smart, she's talented,
she's sensitive.</i>

1336
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:36,875
<i>She can do this, she knows about that,
she made this, she cares about that."</i>

1337
01:05:36,958 --> 01:05:39,666
Let me just take him to the bathroom,
then we'll go.

1338
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:41,000
[young woman] <i>I need to end it.</i>

1339
01:05:41,083 --> 01:05:42,041
Is that the girl?

1340
01:05:44,125 --> 01:05:46,833
- Yes, Dad, Louisa.
- Oh. [breathing heavily]

1341
01:05:46,916 --> 01:05:47,750
Good.

1342
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:49,750
I brought your mother's, uh...

1343
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:55,416
nightgown.

1344
01:05:56,333 --> 01:05:57,208
For her.

1345
01:05:59,208 --> 01:06:00,958
That's... [stammers]

1346
01:06:01,041 --> 01:06:02,625
Very kind. I...

1347
01:06:04,708 --> 01:06:06,166
I have to go home tonight.

1348
01:06:06,958 --> 01:06:07,791
Soon.

1349
01:06:07,875 --> 01:06:11,625
Oh, I-I... I don't understand.
What does she mean?

1350
01:06:11,708 --> 01:06:13,000
I don't know, Dad.

1351
01:06:13,083 --> 01:06:15,458
- I can't tell.
- [young woman] I have my shift tomorrow.

1352
01:06:16,916 --> 01:06:18,125
She's a waitress.

1353
01:06:18,208 --> 01:06:19,125
Oh

1354
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:20,333
[Jake chuckles]

1355
01:06:20,416 --> 01:06:22,833
We.. we met when she was serving me.

1356
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:25,833
It's a sweet story.

1357
01:06:27,791 --> 01:06:31,041
I asked her about the...

1358
01:06:31,666 --> 01:06:34,000
[Jake and young woman] Santa Fe burger.

1359
01:06:34,083 --> 01:06:35,833
[all chuckling]

1360
01:06:36,833 --> 01:06:38,250
I'm feeling confused.

1361
01:06:38,333 --> 01:06:40,083
Let's just get you to the bathroom.

1362
01:06:41,333 --> 01:06:42,958
We don't want another accident.

1363
01:06:43,458 --> 01:06:44,500
Remember last night?

1364
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:46,416
[mother] What's this old thing doing here?

1365
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:47,750
I'm not sure.

1366
01:06:47,833 --> 01:06:49,000
Oh, my goodness it's filthy.

1367
01:06:49,083 --> 01:06:51,500
It's got Jake's baby food on it.
What's it doing here?

1368
01:06:51,583 --> 01:06:52,750
[chuckles] I tell you,

1369
01:06:52,833 --> 01:06:55,708
I would misplace my own head
if it wasn't screwed onto my own head.

1370
01:06:55,791 --> 01:06:58,666
Would you be a sweetheart and toss it
in the washer? I just started a load.

1371
01:06:58,750 --> 01:07:01,166
My hands are full picking up
all these darn toys.

1372
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:04,375
Jake would leave his head on the floor
if it wasn't screwed onto his own head.

1373
01:07:04,458 --> 01:07:05,500
[young woman] Sure.

1374
01:07:05,583 --> 01:07:07,083
- Where is it?
- In the basement.

1375
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,541
I don't think Jake wants me down there.

1376
01:07:11,625 --> 01:07:13,166
Jake can be controlling.

1377
01:07:13,250 --> 01:07:15,333
You can't allow him to control you.

1378
01:07:15,708 --> 01:07:19,833
I think it's the other side of his type
of personality. This diligence thing.

1379
01:07:19,916 --> 01:07:21,500
He needs to control everything.

1380
01:07:21,583 --> 01:07:23,291
There's so many,

1381
01:07:23,375 --> 01:07:25,750
many things that make him nervous.

1382
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:29,291
He keeps closing off more and more
of the world. It's a problem.

1383
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:32,125
And the few people
he does have left in his life

1384
01:07:32,208 --> 01:07:33,708
need to follow all sorts of rules.

1385
01:07:33,791 --> 01:07:35,125
It really is a problem.

1386
01:07:35,208 --> 01:07:36,625
Yes, I'm probably to blame.

1387
01:07:37,875 --> 01:07:40,958
And all this guilt
causes me to feel obligated...

1388
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:44,666
[sighs] ...to bend over backwards
to accommodate his every little whim.

1389
01:07:44,750 --> 01:07:46,375
It's a vicious cycle.

1390
01:07:46,916 --> 01:07:48,791
So what exactly are you saying to me?

1391
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:53,958
[whispering] I'm saying,
take the darn nightgown to the basement.

1392
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,541
Live dangerously.

1393
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,333
[wind howling]

1394
01:08:23,166 --> 01:08:24,875
[inhales deeply, then grunts]

1395
01:08:29,958 --> 01:08:31,625
[Jake] You... you sent her down?

1396
01:08:32,791 --> 01:08:33,958
[mother] To the washer.

1397
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:36,250
[Jake] Mom! Really?

1398
01:08:37,125 --> 01:08:39,791
[muffled] You don't have to do laundry
for my mom.

1399
01:08:39,875 --> 01:08:41,166
You're a guest,

1400
01:08:41,958 --> 01:08:45,458
and we... we... we'll get you
a clean nightgown for tonight.

1401
01:08:45,541 --> 01:08:47,583
- I don't mind.
- [Jake] Well, we really need...

1402
01:08:47,666 --> 01:08:49,250
We really need to get on the road.

1403
01:08:50,833 --> 01:08:53,000
I could... I could use some help
with the chains.

1404
01:08:53,083 --> 01:08:54,250
Right, I'll be up.

1405
01:08:54,875 --> 01:08:55,916
[wind whistling]

1406
01:08:57,166 --> 01:08:58,458
[tense music plays]

1407
01:09:02,666 --> 01:09:03,750
[washer running]

1408
01:09:18,125 --> 01:09:18,958
[water splashing]

1409
01:09:32,083 --> 01:09:33,125
[water splashing]

1410
01:10:19,458 --> 01:10:23,291
[young woman] <i>It's tragic how few people</i>
<i>possess their souls before they die.</i>

1411
01:10:25,458 --> 01:10:28,750
<i>"Nothing is more rare in any man,"
says Emerson,</i>

1412
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:30,541
<i>"than an act of his own."</i>

1413
01:10:31,250 --> 01:10:32,583
<i>And it's quite true.</i>

1414
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,541
<i>Most people are other people.</i>

1415
01:10:35,375 --> 01:10:37,500
<i>Their thoughts are
someone else's opinions.</i>

1416
01:10:37,875 --> 01:10:40,666
<i>Their lives a mimicry,
their passions a quotation.</i>

1417
01:10:42,250 --> 01:10:43,708
<i>That's an Oscar Wilde quote.</i>

1418
01:10:44,125 --> 01:10:46,416
[cell phone ringing]

1419
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:50,541
[man's voice] <i>There's only one question</i>

1420
01:10:50,625 --> 01:10:54,000
<i>I'm scared. I feel a little crazy.
I'm not lucid.</i>

1421
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:57,041
<i>The assumptions are right.
I can feel my fear growing.</i>

1422
01:10:57,125 --> 01:10:58,833
<i>Now is the time for the answer.</i>

1423
01:10:58,916 --> 01:11:01,666
<i>Just one question,
one question to answer.</i>

1424
01:11:05,125 --> 01:11:06,833
- [closes door]
- [breathing heavily]

1425
01:11:08,583 --> 01:11:09,625
[wind whistling]

1426
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:15,916
Oh, my God.

1427
01:11:16,875 --> 01:11:17,875
Jake, is your mom...

1428
01:11:17,958 --> 01:11:19,708
[Jake shushing]

1429
01:11:25,083 --> 01:11:27,458
- She's...
- [shushing]

1430
01:11:29,166 --> 01:11:30,291
She's asleep.

1431
01:11:32,125 --> 01:11:33,250
[young woman] She's...

1432
01:11:34,291 --> 01:11:35,875
We should go.

1433
01:11:37,541 --> 01:11:39,041
It's getting treacherous.

1434
01:11:40,375 --> 01:11:42,083
Are you certain she's all right?

1435
01:11:42,166 --> 01:11:43,666
Out like a light.

1436
01:11:47,375 --> 01:11:48,708
It's a good time to go.

1437
01:11:50,541 --> 01:11:51,583
What about your dad?

1438
01:11:52,291 --> 01:11:53,125
He's...

1439
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:54,708
[inhales deeply]

1440
01:11:55,166 --> 01:11:56,958
He's puttering somewhere.

1441
01:11:59,458 --> 01:12:01,000
The disposal's out again.

1442
01:12:03,958 --> 01:12:05,291
It was great to meet you.

1443
01:12:08,208 --> 01:12:09,708
It was great to meet you too.

1444
01:12:13,708 --> 01:12:15,791
Thank you so much for your hospitality.

1445
01:12:15,875 --> 01:12:18,541
Oh, you're welcome here any time. Yes.

1446
01:12:24,625 --> 01:12:26,416
Jake's a good boy, yes?

1447
01:12:27,833 --> 01:12:28,916
- [young woman] Yes.
- Yeah?

1448
01:12:29,416 --> 01:12:31,208
A good man, I should say.

1449
01:12:32,333 --> 01:12:33,208
You agree?

1450
01:12:33,708 --> 01:12:34,666
Yes.

1451
01:12:39,375 --> 01:12:40,458
OK then, well...

1452
01:12:44,208 --> 01:12:45,458
[wind howling]

1453
01:12:53,583 --> 01:12:54,458
[sniffles]

1454
01:12:56,791 --> 01:12:58,833
[deep breath]

1455
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:00,583
- [wind howling]
- [chains rattling]

1456
01:13:08,208 --> 01:13:09,375
[young woman groans]

1457
01:13:15,458 --> 01:13:16,291
So?

1458
01:13:17,833 --> 01:13:19,291
Did you like them?

1459
01:13:20,208 --> 01:13:22,625
Uh, y-yes, they're very nice.

1460
01:13:22,708 --> 01:13:23,958
[wind whistling]

1461
01:13:24,041 --> 01:13:25,041
Really?

1462
01:13:25,125 --> 01:13:25,958
Yes.

1463
01:13:28,208 --> 01:13:31,500
They can be a little pushy,
but they're basically decent people.

1464
01:13:31,916 --> 01:13:33,250
That was eminently clear.

1465
01:13:35,791 --> 01:13:37,416
They both loved you, by the way.

1466
01:13:38,083 --> 01:13:39,333
That's good. I'm glad.

1467
01:13:41,541 --> 01:13:44,500
- [Jake] So smart, my mother said.
- [slight chuckle] Did she?

1468
01:13:45,041 --> 01:13:47,958
Well, not to you. That would've
made you uncomfortable.

1469
01:13:48,833 --> 01:13:51,333
But, um, when I was helping her
with the dishes.

1470
01:13:52,041 --> 01:13:55,166
[young woman] <i>I don't remember Jake</i>
<i>helping his mother with the dishes.</i>

1471
01:13:55,833 --> 01:13:58,833
<i>I feel uncertain about a lot
of what happened tonight. It felt like...</i>

1472
01:13:58,916 --> 01:14:01,291
When you and Dad were discussing...

1473
01:14:01,375 --> 01:14:02,250
[young woman] What?

1474
01:14:03,250 --> 01:14:05,208
When you and Dad were discussing...

1475
01:14:05,291 --> 01:14:07,416
[young woman] <i>It seemed</i>
<i>as if everything was slightly...</i>

1476
01:14:07,875 --> 01:14:10,333
- Tariffs.
- Right. Tariffs.

1477
01:14:10,875 --> 01:14:12,791
[Jake inhales deeply]

1478
01:14:13,166 --> 01:14:16,000
Yeah, I-I do remember now.
I'm a little fuzzy.

1479
01:14:16,083 --> 01:14:17,458
You did have a lot of wine.

1480
01:14:19,416 --> 01:14:21,541
He was thrilled to have someone
who knew the difference.

1481
01:14:21,625 --> 01:14:22,458
Did I?

1482
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:23,666
You did.

1483
01:14:24,666 --> 01:14:25,500
Uh...

1484
01:14:26,041 --> 01:14:28,958
I don't think you noticed,
because he kept topping you off.

1485
01:14:29,041 --> 01:14:30,958
- Did he?
- [Jake] Yes, yes, yes.

1486
01:14:31,041 --> 01:14:32,041
[young woman] Right.

1487
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,125
I didn't notice that.

1488
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:36,125
- [Jake] Yeah.
- [young woman] Tricky.

1489
01:14:36,208 --> 01:14:37,666
[Jake] Makes it hard to keep count.

1490
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,250
- It does.
- As I was saying...

1491
01:14:42,458 --> 01:14:44,916
All in all, I think everything...

1492
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,666
[inhales deeply] ...went well.

1493
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:48,666
I think it was a successful visit.

1494
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:49,875
Mm-hmm. Yes.

1495
01:14:51,166 --> 01:14:52,791
Everyone got to know each other.

1496
01:14:52,875 --> 01:14:55,166
That's true. They're very nice.

1497
01:14:55,250 --> 01:14:56,750
- You liked them?
- Yes.

1498
01:14:56,833 --> 01:14:59,125
[Jake] They liked you, too.
I think that...

1499
01:14:59,208 --> 01:15:00,916
I think that's a good sign.

1500
01:15:01,875 --> 01:15:02,708
S-Sign?

1501
01:15:02,791 --> 01:15:03,625
Sign.

1502
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:06,416
Sign is perhaps not the right word.

1503
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:08,500
- The thing.
- Oh.

1504
01:15:08,583 --> 01:15:09,833
[Jake] The good thing.

1505
01:15:09,916 --> 01:15:11,500
- Yeah.
- [Jake] Good thing.

1506
01:15:12,750 --> 01:15:15,125
It's good when people you like,
like each other.

1507
01:15:18,125 --> 01:15:19,958
[young woman]
<i>People like to think of themselves</i>

1508
01:15:20,041 --> 01:15:21,875
<i>as points moving through time.</i>

1509
01:15:22,791 --> 01:15:24,750
<i>But I think it's probably the opposite.</i>

1510
01:15:25,625 --> 01:15:26,958
<i>We're stationary,</i>

1511
01:15:27,333 --> 01:15:29,208
<i>and time passes through us,</i>

1512
01:15:29,916 --> 01:15:31,500
<i>blowing like cold wind,</i>

1513
01:15:32,583 --> 01:15:33,833
<i>stealing our heat,</i>

1514
01:15:33,916 --> 01:15:36,291
<i>- leaving us chapped and frozen.</i>
- What are you thinking?

1515
01:15:36,375 --> 01:15:38,875
[young woman] <i>I don't know, dead.</i>

1516
01:15:40,208 --> 01:15:42,458
<i>I feel like I was that wind tonight.</i>

1517
01:15:43,166 --> 01:15:45,000
<i>Blowing through Jake's parents.</i>

1518
01:15:45,666 --> 01:15:48,416
<i>Seeing them as they were,
seeing them as they will be.</i>

1519
01:15:48,833 --> 01:15:50,916
<i>- Seeing them after they're gone.</i>
- What are you...

1520
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,458
- [young woman] <i>When only I'm left.</i>
- What are you thinking?

1521
01:15:53,541 --> 01:15:54,750
[young woman] <i>Only the wind.</i>

1522
01:15:54,833 --> 01:15:55,958
Not much.

1523
01:15:59,333 --> 01:16:00,166
Really?

1524
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:02,625
I'm tired, Jake. The wine, I guess.

1525
01:16:02,708 --> 01:16:03,833
Yes, you did have a lot.

1526
01:16:03,916 --> 01:16:04,833
Yes.

1527
01:16:05,375 --> 01:16:07,208
It is a depressant, as you know.

1528
01:16:07,291 --> 01:16:08,125
Of course I know.

1529
01:16:08,208 --> 01:16:11,666
I think it's important for people
to keep that in mind

1530
01:16:11,750 --> 01:16:14,125
before they make decisions
under its influence.

1531
01:16:17,750 --> 01:16:18,625
[blows raspberry]

1532
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:22,625
[both laugh]

1533
01:16:24,541 --> 01:16:27,583
<i>- A Woman Under the Influence.</i>
- Amazing film.

1534
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:30,958
I'm not sure I agree.

1535
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:33,916
[young woman sniffs]

1536
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:38,291
I've been watching that film over and over
for my essay due Wednesday.

1537
01:16:42,166 --> 01:16:44,375
I felt, uh, a kinship

1538
01:16:45,208 --> 01:16:46,625
with Mabel, I guess.

1539
01:16:47,250 --> 01:16:51,541
She's such a powerful,
horribly wronged character.

1540
01:16:51,625 --> 01:16:52,458
Is she?

1541
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:55,875
I think...

1542
01:16:58,625 --> 01:16:59,458
[inhales]

1543
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,000
[exhales]

1544
01:17:02,666 --> 01:17:04,333
Mabel Longhetti is bombed out

1545
01:17:04,416 --> 01:17:06,750
because she's always trying
to please everyone,

1546
01:17:08,166 --> 01:17:12,500
so that she can be considered one more
victim-heroine for the women's liberation.

1547
01:17:12,833 --> 01:17:15,500
But only by women liberationists

1548
01:17:15,583 --> 01:17:18,208
who are willing to accept
textbook spin-offs as art.

1549
01:17:18,291 --> 01:17:20,416
The Junoesque Gena Rowlands,

1550
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:24,500
Mrs. Cassavetes, is a prodigious actress,
and she never lets go of the character.

1551
01:17:24,583 --> 01:17:27,458
I agree. I-I thought she was
great in the role.

1552
01:17:29,458 --> 01:17:32,916
- Seemed to me she... she encompassed...
- [young woman] Now at an indeterminate age

1553
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,250
when her beauty has deepened
beyond ingenue roles,

1554
01:17:35,333 --> 01:17:36,958
Rowlands can look old or young.

1555
01:17:37,041 --> 01:17:40,666
Shades of expression
transform Mabel Longhetti from...

1556
01:17:41,041 --> 01:17:43,625
[stammers]
a radiantly flirtatious beauty

1557
01:17:43,708 --> 01:17:45,958
into a sad, sagging neighborhood drunk.

1558
01:17:46,041 --> 01:17:49,250
Rowlands externalizes
schizophrenic dissolution.

1559
01:17:50,250 --> 01:17:52,625
Mabel fragments before your eyes.

1560
01:17:52,708 --> 01:17:55,500
A three-ring circus
might be taking place in her face.

1561
01:17:56,250 --> 01:17:59,500
Rowland's performance is enough
for half a dozen tours de force,

1562
01:17:59,583 --> 01:18:01,916
a whole row of Oscars. It's exhausting.

1563
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,125
Conceivably,
she is a great actress, but...

1564
01:18:04,208 --> 01:18:07,291
nothing she does is memorable,
because she does so much.

1565
01:18:13,458 --> 01:18:14,875
[inhales deeply]

1566
01:18:15,666 --> 01:18:16,500
[exhales]

1567
01:18:16,583 --> 01:18:19,875
It's the most transient
big performance I've ever seen.

1568
01:18:19,958 --> 01:18:23,250
I guess I'm unclear
what you mean by transient?

1569
01:18:26,666 --> 01:18:28,625
Mabel tries to slash her wrist,

1570
01:18:28,708 --> 01:18:30,375
Nick puts a band-aid on the cut.

1571
01:18:30,458 --> 01:18:32,625
The idiot symbolism is enough
to make you want to hoot,

1572
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:34,458
but this two-hour and 35-minute movie

1573
01:18:34,541 --> 01:18:36,791
leaves you too groggy
to do more than moan.

1574
01:18:36,875 --> 01:18:40,625
Details that are meant to establish
the pathological nature

1575
01:18:40,708 --> 01:18:42,708
of the characters surrounding Mabel...

1576
01:18:42,791 --> 01:18:47,791
[stammers] ...and so show her isolation
become instead limp, false moments.

1577
01:18:48,208 --> 01:18:50,208
It's unclear whether the characters
are unconscious

1578
01:18:50,291 --> 01:18:53,666
or whether it's Cassavetes
who's unconscious of what he's doing.

1579
01:18:54,041 --> 01:18:56,375
The children keep murmuring
that they love her.

1580
01:18:56,833 --> 01:18:59,208
There's no clue
as how to decipher that refrain.

1581
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:01,625
Are they coddling her?

1582
01:19:02,041 --> 01:19:05,541
Reversing roles and treating her
like a child in need of reassurance?

1583
01:19:05,625 --> 01:19:08,416
Or are they as unashamedly loving
as she is?

1584
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:10,416
And what are... what are we to make

1585
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:12,625
of Nick the Pulper's
constant assertations?

1586
01:19:12,708 --> 01:19:14,250
Is assertations even a word?

1587
01:19:14,333 --> 01:19:18,000
- I thought it was assertions.
- They're both words. Look it up.

1588
01:19:19,125 --> 01:19:22,208
What are we to make of Nick the Pulper's
constant assertations of love?

1589
01:19:22,291 --> 01:19:24,625
The... the movie is entirely tendentious.

1590
01:19:24,708 --> 01:19:27,291
It's all planned yet it isn't thought out.

1591
01:19:27,375 --> 01:19:28,500
[wind howling]

1592
01:19:33,250 --> 01:19:34,666
[Jake inhales deeply]

1593
01:19:34,750 --> 01:19:35,750
[exhales]

1594
01:19:36,541 --> 01:19:38,291
I do see what you're saying.

1595
01:19:41,666 --> 01:19:46,583
You are certainly the expert
on things cinematic.

1596
01:19:46,666 --> 01:19:47,500
Yeah.

1597
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:49,833
I am.

1598
01:19:53,541 --> 01:19:55,208
[Jake] I-I guess I was just...

1599
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:56,250
[inhales deeply]

1600
01:19:56,333 --> 01:19:57,208
Taken in...

1601
01:19:57,875 --> 01:20:02,916
by the... the sympathy
that Cassavetes showed for her.

1602
01:20:03,625 --> 01:20:07,583
I feel like maybe our society
lacks a certain kindness,

1603
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:14,625
a certain willingness
to take in the struggles of others...

1604
01:20:14,708 --> 01:20:19,708
[stammers] ...struggling with, uh,
issues caused by...

1605
01:20:19,791 --> 01:20:21,625
[young woman] An alienating society?

1606
01:20:22,750 --> 01:20:23,791
I don't know.

1607
01:20:24,666 --> 01:20:26,041
Uh, I guess.

1608
01:20:26,458 --> 01:20:28,083
Yeah. It seems hopeless.

1609
01:20:31,208 --> 01:20:32,125
What does?

1610
01:20:32,208 --> 01:20:33,041
[Jake sighs]

1611
01:20:34,875 --> 01:20:37,041
[Jake] All of it. Uh, everything.

1612
01:20:37,125 --> 01:20:38,583
Like feeling old,

1613
01:20:38,666 --> 01:20:42,541
like your body is going,
your hearing, your sight.

1614
01:20:43,833 --> 01:20:46,666
You can't see, and you're invisible.

1615
01:20:46,750 --> 01:20:48,000
[inhales deeply]

1616
01:20:48,083 --> 01:20:51,708
And you've made so many wrong turns.

1617
01:20:53,875 --> 01:20:54,833
The lie of it all.

1618
01:20:54,916 --> 01:20:57,375
- What is the lie of it all?
- [Jake] I don't know! That...

1619
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,166
it's going to get better,
that it's never too late,

1620
01:21:00,250 --> 01:21:01,458
that... [inhales]

1621
01:21:01,541 --> 01:21:02,958
God has a plan for you.

1622
01:21:03,041 --> 01:21:05,333
- That age is just a number.
- Shut up.

1623
01:21:05,416 --> 01:21:06,250
That...

1624
01:21:06,333 --> 01:21:07,291
[inhales deeply]

1625
01:21:07,375 --> 01:21:09,833
It's always darkest
before the dawn. That…

1626
01:21:11,041 --> 01:21:14,083
Every cloud has a fucking silver lining!

1627
01:21:14,625 --> 01:21:16,250
- [deep breath]
- [blows raspberry]

1628
01:21:17,125 --> 01:21:18,041
That there's...

1629
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:21,958
- That there's someone for everyone.
- [blows raspberry]

1630
01:21:22,291 --> 01:21:23,583
Platitudes all.

1631
01:21:24,291 --> 01:21:25,166
[blows raspberry]

1632
01:21:27,041 --> 01:21:30,041
Shut up, Mabel! Sit down, Mabel!

1633
01:21:31,250 --> 01:21:32,125
[blows raspberry]

1634
01:21:32,583 --> 01:21:33,458
[blows raspberry]

1635
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,291
And God never gives us
more than we can bear.

1636
01:21:40,958 --> 01:21:42,416
God's a good egg that way.

1637
01:21:45,333 --> 01:21:47,000
Hey, do you want something sweet?

1638
01:21:47,375 --> 01:21:48,291
What do you mean?

1639
01:21:48,375 --> 01:21:51,375
- Dessert.
- Didn't we have dessert at your mom's?

1640
01:21:51,458 --> 01:21:54,541
I feel like there was
this huge cake thing, or...

1641
01:21:54,625 --> 01:21:55,916
[chuckles]

1642
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:56,833
True.

1643
01:21:56,916 --> 01:21:59,166
I guess I'm a sugar junkie!

1644
01:21:59,250 --> 01:22:00,416
[laughs]

1645
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:01,333
I don't know.

1646
01:22:04,833 --> 01:22:07,250
[inhales deeply]
It might help me stay awake.

1647
01:22:07,333 --> 01:22:09,125
Then definitely!

1648
01:22:10,250 --> 01:22:13,041
We need Jake awake for a bit.
This is all so treacherous.

1649
01:22:13,458 --> 01:22:16,500
There's a Tulsey Town
just at the turn-off up ahead.

1650
01:22:16,833 --> 01:22:18,041
[young woman] A Tulsey Town?

1651
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:19,458
[laughs]

1652
01:22:19,541 --> 01:22:22,166
Open now? In this? It's freezing.

1653
01:22:22,625 --> 01:22:26,791
- It is perfect weather for a Brrr.
- [laughs]

1654
01:22:28,208 --> 01:22:29,333
Don't you think?

1655
01:22:29,416 --> 01:22:30,541
Yeah, I guess it is.

1656
01:22:33,333 --> 01:22:35,708
<i>♪ Gettin' Tulsey Town ♪</i>

1657
01:22:36,083 --> 01:22:40,750
[both] <i>♪ We're here to soft serve! ♪</i>

1658
01:22:40,833 --> 01:22:42,083
Tulsey Town.

1659
01:22:42,625 --> 01:22:43,666
Huh.

1660
01:22:45,125 --> 01:22:47,583
Jesus, I never thought of that before.

1661
01:22:50,041 --> 01:22:52,125
What do you suppose Tulsey Town is?

1662
01:22:52,208 --> 01:22:53,333
[Jake] Based on the clown...

1663
01:22:53,416 --> 01:22:54,583
[laughing]

1664
01:22:54,666 --> 01:22:56,541
I'd say it's a circus town.

1665
01:22:57,250 --> 01:22:59,000
Maybe like that place...

1666
01:23:00,208 --> 01:23:03,791
uh, where the sideshow folks go
during off season.

1667
01:23:03,875 --> 01:23:06,166
- Ruled by the clown lady?
- Ah.

1668
01:23:06,541 --> 01:23:08,500
Well, yes, she wears a crown.

1669
01:23:08,583 --> 01:23:09,500
She has a...

1670
01:23:10,041 --> 01:23:11,791
- clown crown?
- [laughs]

1671
01:23:11,875 --> 01:23:16,833
A benevolent and tolerant
ice cream clown queen.

1672
01:23:16,916 --> 01:23:19,208
- [young woman laughs]
- Made entirely of lactose.

1673
01:23:19,291 --> 01:23:21,458
She is lactose tolerant!

1674
01:23:21,541 --> 01:23:23,208
She's sweet but cold.

1675
01:23:23,291 --> 01:23:24,583
[young woman] Like your mum.

1676
01:23:24,666 --> 01:23:26,166
[laughs]

1677
01:23:29,958 --> 01:23:30,791
What do you mean?

1678
01:23:30,875 --> 01:23:33,125
Nothing. I don't know why I said that.
That just came out.

1679
01:23:33,208 --> 01:23:35,458
- Did you think of my mother as cold?
- [young woman] No.

1680
01:23:35,541 --> 01:23:38,208
Uh, she was lovely, she really was.

1681
01:23:38,291 --> 01:23:39,166
'Cause I don't...

1682
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:41,083
subscribe to that,

1683
01:23:41,166 --> 01:23:44,666
the mother is the cause
of all psychological problems crap.

1684
01:23:44,750 --> 01:23:48,125
That's misogynistic claptrap.
Freudian bullshit.

1685
01:23:48,208 --> 01:23:49,416
It is tempting...

1686
01:23:50,166 --> 01:23:52,708
to have someone to pin it on, though.
[chuckles]

1687
01:23:52,791 --> 01:23:53,750
Pin what on?

1688
01:23:55,208 --> 01:23:59,250
All of it. Why you feel a certain way,
why you are a certain way.

1689
01:24:01,166 --> 01:24:04,208
That's misogynistic claptrap.
Freudian bullshit.

1690
01:24:05,125 --> 01:24:08,125
A person, an adult, has to,
at one point or another,

1691
01:24:08,583 --> 01:24:11,333
take responsibility for who they are.

1692
01:24:13,625 --> 01:24:14,500
Don't you think?

1693
01:24:15,416 --> 01:24:16,250
- Yeah.
- Yes.

1694
01:24:16,333 --> 01:24:18,375
[young woman] Mother's are people
with their own pain,

1695
01:24:18,458 --> 01:24:20,666
their own history of neglect and abuse.

1696
01:24:21,625 --> 01:24:23,708
Yet, at one time or another,

1697
01:24:23,791 --> 01:24:27,458
during the 20th century, every fucking
childhood trait was blamed on them:

1698
01:24:27,541 --> 01:24:30,666
schizophrenia, autism,
narcissism, homosexuality.

1699
01:24:30,750 --> 01:24:34,750
Not that homosexuality is akin
to any of those other things.

1700
01:24:34,833 --> 01:24:36,958
- Uh, yeah. Of course not.
- Obviously.

1701
01:24:37,041 --> 01:24:39,791
Saying that a mother is to blame
for her child's homosexuality

1702
01:24:39,875 --> 01:24:42,916
is to imply that homosexuality
is somehow negative.

1703
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:47,916
I was just saying that when homosexuality
was considered a pathology

1704
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,583
in the DSM before 1973,

1705
01:24:51,250 --> 01:24:53,416
a coddling mother

1706
01:24:54,916 --> 01:24:57,166
- was often seen as the culprit.
- Right.

1707
01:24:58,708 --> 01:24:59,708
[Jake inhales deeply]

1708
01:24:59,791 --> 01:25:01,083
[exhales]

1709
01:25:01,166 --> 01:25:05,958
It's despicable how we label people
and categorize them and dismiss them.

1710
01:25:06,916 --> 01:25:09,208
-[sighs]
I look at the kids

1711
01:25:09,291 --> 01:25:11,625
I see at school every day.

1712
01:25:13,416 --> 01:25:15,791
I see the ones who are ostracized.
They're...

1713
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:18,166
different. They're out of step.

1714
01:25:18,250 --> 01:25:21,166
<i>And I see the lives they'll have
because of that.</i>

1715
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:26,625
<i>Sometimes I see them years later,
in town, at the supermarket.</i>

1716
01:25:32,291 --> 01:25:34,708
[stammering] I see,

1717
01:25:34,791 --> 01:25:38,208
I can tell that they still carry
that stuff around with them.

1718
01:25:39,333 --> 01:25:40,250
Like a...

1719
01:25:41,208 --> 01:25:42,916
black aura.

1720
01:25:44,583 --> 01:25:46,250
Like a millstone.

1721
01:25:48,625 --> 01:25:50,208
Like an oozing wound.

1722
01:25:52,875 --> 01:25:53,708
Jake.

1723
01:25:55,166 --> 01:25:57,000
- I'm thinking...
- Here! Ta-da!

1724
01:26:00,708 --> 01:26:02,791
[young woman] Oh. Man, that's brutal.

1725
01:26:04,083 --> 01:26:06,500
Brutal place, the land of Tulsey Town.

1726
01:26:09,916 --> 01:26:11,208
Climate change here too.

1727
01:26:11,708 --> 01:26:12,833
Have you read the novel <i>Ice?</i>

1728
01:26:12,916 --> 01:26:15,458
- [young woman] I don't think so.
- [Jake] By Anna Kavan?

1729
01:26:15,541 --> 01:26:16,416
I don't think so.

1730
01:26:17,166 --> 01:26:20,166
[Jake] 1967, it's a fable of sorts,
about...

1731
01:26:20,250 --> 01:26:22,250
Let's just get the ice cream and go,
it's freezing.

1732
01:26:22,333 --> 01:26:25,041
Wait a minute.
I just want to see who's on tonight first.

1733
01:26:25,125 --> 01:26:26,958
[young woman] You know the people
who work here?

1734
01:26:27,541 --> 01:26:28,458
Some of them.

1735
01:26:29,250 --> 01:26:32,458
Well, I stop sometimes
after visiting my parents.

1736
01:26:32,833 --> 01:26:35,916
I don't like some of the girls
that work here, so I just wanna make sure.

1737
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,875
- [young woman] What's wrong with them?
- I don't know. People...

1738
01:26:39,458 --> 01:26:40,708
can be cold to me.

1739
01:26:40,791 --> 01:26:43,208
- Uh, I'm gonna wait in the car.
- [Jake] No, no! Say hello.

1740
01:26:43,291 --> 01:26:45,750
They won't come if they know it's me.

1741
01:26:51,458 --> 01:26:52,416
[knocking]

1742
01:26:53,166 --> 01:26:55,375
- Hello, anybody here?
- [woman] In a minute!

1743
01:26:55,458 --> 01:26:57,666
- So, <i>Ice</i> takes place...
- [young woman sighs]

1744
01:26:57,750 --> 01:26:58,708
during, uh...

1745
01:26:59,125 --> 01:27:01,833
an environmental cataclysm,
causing the world to become

1746
01:27:01,916 --> 01:27:04,541
- a frozen wasteland.
- [knocking]

1747
01:27:04,625 --> 01:27:05,541
And the main...

1748
01:27:05,916 --> 01:27:06,791
[young woman groans]

1749
01:27:06,875 --> 01:27:07,916
[woman] Hi!

1750
01:27:09,375 --> 01:27:10,250
Hi.

1751
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,083
Can I help you, sir?

1752
01:27:22,625 --> 01:27:23,458
Uh...

1753
01:27:25,625 --> 01:27:27,625
So, yeah, uh, I'll have, uh...

1754
01:27:28,041 --> 01:27:29,083
Oreo Brr.

1755
01:27:29,166 --> 01:27:30,333
And he'll have...

1756
01:27:30,416 --> 01:27:31,500
[stammering]

1757
01:27:31,583 --> 01:27:32,458
Same.

1758
01:27:32,541 --> 01:27:33,916
Uh, two of those, please.

1759
01:27:35,708 --> 01:27:36,833
Two "sames."

1760
01:27:37,666 --> 01:27:38,625
[giggles]

1761
01:27:39,250 --> 01:27:40,625
[women giggling]

1762
01:27:42,125 --> 01:27:44,458
Uh, sorry, uh, we need to get back
on the road.

1763
01:27:44,541 --> 01:27:47,666
So can we get them as quick
as... as... as possible?

1764
01:27:48,875 --> 01:27:49,916
[women giggling]

1765
01:27:50,291 --> 01:27:52,041
Uh, sorry, hi.

1766
01:27:52,125 --> 01:27:55,000
Sorry about the smell, they're doing some
varnishing in the back.

1767
01:27:55,791 --> 01:27:56,625
Varnishing?

1768
01:27:57,833 --> 01:27:58,708
Shelves.

1769
01:27:59,416 --> 01:28:00,958
[young woman] Oh. No problem.

1770
01:28:03,708 --> 01:28:05,833
[young woman] <i>I know this girl.</i>
<i>I've seen her somewhere.</i>

1771
01:28:05,916 --> 01:28:07,916
<i>I've seen her before, her... her face.</i>

1772
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,625
<i>Her rash, I know her.
It's on the tip of my tongue.</i>

1773
01:28:10,708 --> 01:28:12,833
<i>Tip of my brain, as Jake says.</i>

1774
01:28:12,916 --> 01:28:14,666
<i>She's someone. She's from somewhere.</i>

1775
01:28:15,291 --> 01:28:16,375
<i>I'm certain of it.</i>

1776
01:28:16,458 --> 01:28:18,708
[shivering]

1777
01:28:18,791 --> 01:28:20,500
It's a fucking blizzard out there.

1778
01:28:21,458 --> 01:28:23,166
Surprised you were open
on a night like this.

1779
01:28:23,250 --> 01:28:25,791
It's a fucking blizzard out there,
fucking Brrr in here.

1780
01:28:26,125 --> 01:28:27,250
Yeah, I-I...

1781
01:28:27,333 --> 01:28:29,166
I was thinking the exact same thing.

1782
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:33,500
You're kind.

1783
01:28:33,583 --> 01:28:35,541
- [women giggle]
- You're not like them.

1784
01:28:36,291 --> 01:28:39,458
Vapid and mean and pretty.

1785
01:28:40,875 --> 01:28:41,708
Thanks a lot.

1786
01:28:42,833 --> 01:28:44,208
I didn't mean it like that.

1787
01:28:46,125 --> 01:28:47,333
I love the way you look.

1788
01:28:47,416 --> 01:28:50,166
You... you have a kindness,
and of course you're very attractive.

1789
01:28:50,250 --> 01:28:52,916
- I didn't mean it like that.
- It's OK. I understand.

1790
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:54,833
It's, uh...

1791
01:28:55,541 --> 01:28:56,750
It's just, there seem...

1792
01:28:57,250 --> 01:28:58,166
seems to be a...

1793
01:28:58,708 --> 01:29:02,041
certain hardness that comes
with a certain kind of pretty.

1794
01:29:02,125 --> 01:29:03,000
You don't have that.

1795
01:29:03,541 --> 01:29:06,625
Maybe they suffer too, the pretty ones.
I don't know, maybe...

1796
01:29:07,375 --> 01:29:09,666
maybe their prettiness
causes them suffering.

1797
01:29:10,791 --> 01:29:12,166
I'm not a psychiatrist.

1798
01:29:12,666 --> 01:29:16,458
[young woman] <i>What an odd thing to say.</i>
<i>Of course she's not a psychiatrist.</i>

1799
01:29:16,541 --> 01:29:18,083
<i>She can't be more than 15.</i>

1800
01:29:18,166 --> 01:29:20,333
Made them extra high,
since you're so nice.

1801
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:21,875
Thanks.

1802
01:29:22,375 --> 01:29:24,083
It'll be eight dollars, please?

1803
01:29:24,791 --> 01:29:25,791
Jake?

1804
01:29:29,625 --> 01:29:31,833
[Jake breathes deeply]

1805
01:29:36,291 --> 01:29:37,125
Keep the change.

1806
01:29:38,291 --> 01:29:40,291
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Thanks.

1807
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:41,208
I'm worried.

1808
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:44,333
Excuse me?

1809
01:29:44,750 --> 01:29:46,083
I shouldn't be saying this.

1810
01:29:46,166 --> 01:29:48,416
You OK? Do you need me to call for help?

1811
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:49,833
It's not varnish.

1812
01:29:51,750 --> 01:29:53,750
That's not why it smells.
You should know that.

1813
01:29:53,833 --> 01:29:54,666
What do you mean?

1814
01:29:55,208 --> 01:29:57,458
- You don't have to go.
- I don't have to go where?

1815
01:29:57,916 --> 01:30:00,333
Forward, in time. You...

1816
01:30:01,458 --> 01:30:02,541
you can stay here.

1817
01:30:05,083 --> 01:30:06,083
I'm very scared.

1818
01:30:06,166 --> 01:30:08,041
About what? What are you scared about?

1819
01:30:08,125 --> 01:30:10,000
- [woman] I'm scared for you.
- Thank you.

1820
01:30:11,208 --> 01:30:12,291
[women giggling]

1821
01:30:12,375 --> 01:30:14,708
Have a good night. Be careful.
The roads are treacherous.

1822
01:30:15,375 --> 01:30:16,583
[women giggling]

1823
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,875
- [car door opens]
- [young woman sighs]

1824
01:30:22,875 --> 01:30:23,958
[women giggling]

1825
01:30:24,041 --> 01:30:25,958
- [car door opens]
- [engine turns over]

1826
01:30:27,333 --> 01:30:28,208
[car door closes]

1827
01:30:30,125 --> 01:30:31,000
[car door closes]

1828
01:30:40,750 --> 01:30:42,458
You notice that girl's arms?

1829
01:30:42,541 --> 01:30:44,583
- Which girl?
- In the Tulsey Town.

1830
01:30:45,916 --> 01:30:48,416
[Jake] Which girl? There were... several.

1831
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:50,541
Several? There were three.

1832
01:30:50,625 --> 01:30:52,791
Several is anything more than two.

1833
01:30:52,875 --> 01:30:53,750
Really?

1834
01:30:53,833 --> 01:30:55,250
Mm-hmm. Look it up.

1835
01:30:55,333 --> 01:30:57,375
[young woman] Look it up?
Can you stop saying that?

1836
01:30:59,166 --> 01:31:02,125
Anyway, the one... the one with the rash
all over her arms.

1837
01:31:02,208 --> 01:31:03,416
I didn't notice.

1838
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:05,000
You're being willfully obtuse.

1839
01:31:06,958 --> 01:31:08,250
Not my intention.

1840
01:31:08,333 --> 01:31:09,958
[mockingly] "Not my intention."

1841
01:31:11,541 --> 01:31:12,375
Anyway.

1842
01:31:17,916 --> 01:31:19,666
[Jake] How's the Brrr?

1843
01:31:20,208 --> 01:31:21,833
- Too sweet?
- Yeah, it's sweet.

1844
01:31:21,916 --> 01:31:23,833
I always forget how sweet these are.

1845
01:31:23,916 --> 01:31:26,125
A little goes a long way.

1846
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:29,500
I don't think I can eat anymore of mine.

1847
01:31:29,958 --> 01:31:31,166
You barely touched it.

1848
01:31:32,333 --> 01:31:34,625
- It's very sweet.
- [clears throat]

1849
01:31:35,625 --> 01:31:36,458
Yeah.

1850
01:31:37,375 --> 01:31:38,291
It is a lot.

1851
01:31:39,958 --> 01:31:40,833
[inhales sharply]

1852
01:31:42,625 --> 01:31:45,250
- Cold?
- Yeah. The ice cream, I guess.

1853
01:31:48,666 --> 01:31:51,000
We're in the middle of a snow storm.

1854
01:31:51,083 --> 01:31:52,208
[inhales deeply]

1855
01:31:52,291 --> 01:31:55,833
Whose idea was it to go to Tulsey Town
in the middle of all this, anyway?

1856
01:31:55,916 --> 01:31:58,125
I am not saying a word.

1857
01:32:01,125 --> 01:32:01,958
[Jake laughs]

1858
01:32:02,041 --> 01:32:03,250
[young woman laughs]

1859
01:32:03,333 --> 01:32:04,500
[young woman] <i>How odd.</i>

1860
01:32:05,041 --> 01:32:08,166
<i>This is probably the last time
I'll ever be in a car with Jake.</i>

1861
01:32:08,750 --> 01:32:10,708
<i>Soon this'll all be a distant memory.</i>

1862
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:13,958
<i>We'll both be in different places,</i>

1863
01:32:14,041 --> 01:32:15,458
<i>remembering this moment.</i>

1864
01:32:16,333 --> 01:32:17,625
<i>This shared laugh.</i>

1865
01:32:18,125 --> 01:32:19,708
<i>And maybe there'll be regret.</i>

1866
01:32:19,791 --> 01:32:21,208
[young woman laughing]

1867
01:32:21,291 --> 01:32:23,666
[young woman inhales deeply]

1868
01:32:23,750 --> 01:32:26,166
<i>Maybe time will soften
the harder edges, and...</i>

1869
01:32:26,791 --> 01:32:29,958
<i>we'll both think that was sort of nice.</i>

1870
01:32:31,625 --> 01:32:34,708
<i>Why did it have to end?
And there's no way back at that point.</i>

1871
01:32:35,666 --> 01:32:37,833
<i>There's never a way back.</i>

1872
01:32:37,916 --> 01:32:41,125
- You got quiet all of a sudden.
- [young woman] Just watching the storm.

1873
01:32:42,291 --> 01:32:45,458
<i>If you can't even tell the other person
what you're thinking,</i>

1874
01:32:45,541 --> 01:32:48,000
<i>- that doesn't bode well.</i>
- [Jake] Looks like you're done with it.

1875
01:32:49,125 --> 01:32:49,958
What do you mean?

1876
01:32:54,041 --> 01:32:56,291
- Bit of a wasted stop.
- [young woman sniffs]

1877
01:32:56,375 --> 01:33:00,000
At least I can say I've been
to Tulsey Town in the middle of the night,

1878
01:33:00,083 --> 01:33:02,791
in the middle of nowhere,
in the middle of a snowstorm.

[Jake] A supposedly fun thing
you'll never do again.

1889
01:33:39,458 --> 01:33:41,416
- Yes.
- [Jake] Have you... have you read that?

1890
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:42,375
Read what?

1891
01:33:43,541 --> 01:33:45,916
It's a book of essays
by David Foster Wallace.

1892
01:33:46,250 --> 01:33:47,333
[inhales deeply]

1893
01:33:47,416 --> 01:33:48,875
Nope. I have not.

1894
01:33:48,958 --> 01:33:50,416
[exhales]

1895
01:33:50,791 --> 01:33:52,791
It's a book... a book of essays.

1896
01:33:52,875 --> 01:33:54,541
Ah. No, I haven't read it.

1897
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,583
We should... we should find some place
to dump these.

1898
01:34:00,666 --> 01:34:04,083
They're going to melt
and get the cup holders all sticky.

1899
01:34:04,166 --> 01:34:05,083
[young woman] Hmm.

1900
01:34:05,541 --> 01:34:06,375
OK.

1901
01:34:08,916 --> 01:34:09,750
Hmm.

1902
01:34:10,791 --> 01:34:13,500
[Jake] He's got this essay in it
about television.

1903
01:34:13,583 --> 01:34:14,416
[Jake clears throat]

1904
01:34:14,958 --> 01:34:16,708
Pretty people tend to appeal...

1905
01:34:21,083 --> 01:34:25,000
Pretty people tend to be
more pleasing to look at

1906
01:34:25,708 --> 01:34:27,041
than non-pretty people.

1907
01:34:27,125 --> 01:34:28,916
But when we're talking about television,

1908
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:32,625
the combination of sheer audience size
and quiet psychic intercourse

1909
01:34:32,708 --> 01:34:34,208
between images and oglers

1910
01:34:34,291 --> 01:34:37,750
starts a cycle that both enhances
pretty images' appeal

1911
01:34:37,833 --> 01:34:40,833
and erodes us viewers'
own sense of security

1912
01:34:40,916 --> 01:34:42,833
in the face of gazes.

1913
01:34:44,750 --> 01:34:47,333
That... that's from the essay.

1914
01:34:48,416 --> 01:34:49,250
That's...

1915
01:34:49,583 --> 01:34:50,625
that's interesting.

1916
01:34:51,291 --> 01:34:52,125
He killed himself.

1917
01:34:52,916 --> 01:34:55,000
Yeah. Yeah, I-I think I knew that.

1918
01:34:55,083 --> 01:34:56,708
[Jake] Yeah, everybody knows it.

1919
01:34:56,791 --> 01:35:00,250
Even people who know nothing else
about David Foster Wallace,

1920
01:35:00,333 --> 01:35:02,000
never read a word of his writing.

1921
01:35:02,916 --> 01:35:05,666
Suicide becomes the story.

1922
01:35:06,708 --> 01:35:07,833
The mythology.

1923
01:35:08,916 --> 01:35:12,000
The cautionary tale. It's obnoxious.

1924
01:35:13,458 --> 01:35:14,750
It's obnoxious.

1925
01:35:15,375 --> 01:35:18,583
I don't think we know how
to be human anymore.

1926
01:35:19,291 --> 01:35:20,125
Who doesn't?

1927
01:35:20,208 --> 01:35:23,333
[Jake] Our society, our culture, people.

1928
01:35:24,666 --> 01:35:27,333
Whatever all this is.

1929
01:35:28,291 --> 01:35:29,250
Any of us.

1930
01:35:32,041 --> 01:35:34,708
[young woman] Well, have you ever read
any Guy Debord?

1931
01:35:37,166 --> 01:35:39,875
<i>- The Society of the Spectacle?</i>
- Exactly. Yes.

1932
01:35:40,375 --> 01:35:41,750
Yes. Of course.

1933
01:35:42,625 --> 01:35:43,750
Debord says...

1934
01:35:44,958 --> 01:35:48,250
"The spectacle cannot be understood
as a mere visual deception

1935
01:35:48,666 --> 01:35:50,791
produced by mass media technologies.

1936
01:35:52,166 --> 01:35:54,250
It is a worldview
that has actually been materialized."

1937
01:35:54,333 --> 01:35:57,708
Watch the world through this glass,

1938
01:35:58,250 --> 01:35:59,875
pre-interpreted for us.

1939
01:35:59,958 --> 01:36:03,000
And it infects our brains. We become it.

1940
01:36:03,833 --> 01:36:05,125
[whispers] Like a virus.

1941
01:36:13,208 --> 01:36:17,666
Listen, these... these melting things
are... are driving me crazy.

1942
01:36:17,750 --> 01:36:20,583
They're going to get
everything all sticky.

1943
01:36:20,666 --> 01:36:23,208
Well, have you got a plastic bag
or something?

1944
01:36:23,291 --> 01:36:25,208
- No, no, nothing like that.
- A napkin maybe?

1945
01:36:25,291 --> 01:36:27,333
I want to find a place to dump them.

1946
01:36:27,875 --> 01:36:30,291
Well, there doesn't seem
to be anything around here.

1947
01:36:31,291 --> 01:36:35,208
There's a small road
up ahead of us that I know of.

1948
01:36:36,208 --> 01:36:38,750
- There'll... there'll be a garbage can.
- [sighs] I don't know.

1949
01:36:38,833 --> 01:36:40,833
May... maybe we should just head home.

1950
01:36:43,791 --> 01:36:44,666
To the farm?

1951
01:36:44,750 --> 01:36:46,500
No. To the city.

1952
01:36:47,208 --> 01:36:48,916
I'm worried
we're gonna get stuck out here.

1953
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,833
If we turn off the main road
and get stuck, no one's gonna find us.

1954
01:36:51,916 --> 01:36:53,125
It's not... [stammering]

1955
01:36:53,208 --> 01:36:56,041
I'm not going to feel right if I don't

1956
01:36:56,125 --> 01:36:58,416
get rid of these. It'll prey on my mind.

1957
01:36:58,500 --> 01:36:59,833
OK? Shit.

1958
01:37:00,333 --> 01:37:01,166
Shit.

1959
01:37:01,625 --> 01:37:04,541
- [banging]
- Hey, hey! It's not... it's... it's not...

1960
01:37:04,625 --> 01:37:05,458
it's...

1961
01:37:05,791 --> 01:37:07,125
it's not a big deal.

1962
01:37:07,625 --> 01:37:08,458
Really.

1963
01:37:10,166 --> 01:37:12,208
I know that, Ames.

1964
01:37:12,916 --> 01:37:14,583
- [young woman] <i>Ames?</i>
- I know that.

1965
01:37:15,458 --> 01:37:17,291
[young woman] <i>Is that short for Amy?</i>

1966
01:37:18,125 --> 01:37:19,375
<i>That doesn't sound right.</i>

1967
01:37:20,208 --> 01:37:21,791
<i>That doesn't seem like my name.</i>

1968
01:37:22,250 --> 01:37:23,375
<i>Or my nickname.</i>

1969
01:37:23,458 --> 01:37:25,000
[Jake] Let's go here, real quick.

1970
01:37:28,333 --> 01:37:29,958
And I'll get to show you my high school.

1971
01:37:30,833 --> 01:37:31,666
This...

1972
01:37:32,083 --> 01:37:33,333
this goes to a high school?

1973
01:37:33,416 --> 01:37:37,541
[Jake] My high school,
where I spent every tortured day. [sighs]

1974
01:37:37,625 --> 01:37:38,875
For so long.

1975
01:37:39,375 --> 01:37:42,416
For so goddamn... long.

1976
01:37:42,500 --> 01:37:45,458
Can we just turn around?
This doesn't feel right.

1977
01:37:46,083 --> 01:37:48,208
[Jake] I don't understand.
It's just a... a high school.

1978
01:37:48,291 --> 01:37:50,291
- [young woman] It feels wrong.
- I can't turn around.

1979
01:37:50,375 --> 01:37:51,541
The road is too narrow.

1980
01:37:52,083 --> 01:37:57,083
I'll just get to the school,
we'll dump the cups, and we'll leave.

1981
01:37:57,166 --> 01:37:58,625
-OK-No, I-I-I don't...

1982
01:37:58,708 --> 01:38:00,333
I don't know what this is.

1983
01:38:00,416 --> 01:38:03,916
It doesn't make any sense to me.
How do school buses get down here?

1984
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,791
It's a rural high school.

1985
01:38:05,875 --> 01:38:08,833
Yeah, I went... I grew up on a farm.
I went to a rural high school.

1986
01:38:08,916 --> 01:38:10,916
We... There was a... there was a...

1987
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:14,375
[stammering] ...a normal entrance
with a paved fucking road.

1988
01:38:14,458 --> 01:38:17,041
It's fine. Everything is tinged.

1989
01:38:17,958 --> 01:38:21,333
OK? That's the thing
you have to realize.

1990
01:38:21,416 --> 01:38:24,833
- It's tinged?
- Colored by mood, by emotion,

1991
01:38:24,916 --> 01:38:26,416
by past experience.

1992
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:29,750
There is no objective reality.

1993
01:38:30,333 --> 01:38:33,291
You know there's no color
in the universe, right?

1994
01:38:33,375 --> 01:38:36,041
Only in the brain.

1995
01:38:36,125 --> 01:38:39,375
Just electromagnetic frequencies,
the brain tinges them.

1996
01:38:39,458 --> 01:38:42,250
Yes, I am a physicist.
I know what color is.

1997
01:38:42,333 --> 01:38:44,000
Yes, yes. Yes, you are.

1998
01:38:45,250 --> 01:38:46,166
You do.

1999
01:38:46,250 --> 01:38:47,958
Color is the deeds of light.

2000
01:38:50,375 --> 01:38:52,125
It's the deeds and suffering.

2001
01:38:54,083 --> 01:38:55,125
That's beautiful.

2002
01:38:58,666 --> 01:39:00,958
It's not physicist talk,

2003
01:39:02,375 --> 01:39:04,958
but eminently poetic.

2004
01:39:05,291 --> 01:39:07,625
Yeah, well, I am a poet after all.

2005
01:39:07,708 --> 01:39:09,375
[Jake] You are. It's beautiful.

2006
01:39:09,458 --> 01:39:12,416
- This road seems excessively long.
- Seems.

2007
01:39:12,500 --> 01:39:13,916
That's the operative word.

2008
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,916
Time is another thing
that exists only in the brain.

2009
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:20,083
- And yet we get older.
- Older and older, older and older.

2010
01:39:20,791 --> 01:39:23,166
Or so it seems.

2011
01:39:23,625 --> 01:39:24,833
Sometimes I feel...

2012
01:39:25,666 --> 01:39:27,625
I'm much younger

2013
01:39:28,291 --> 01:39:31,166
than I actually am,
like still a kid inside,

2014
01:39:31,250 --> 01:39:33,291
until I pass a mirror.

2015
01:39:33,375 --> 01:39:35,625
- Is younger better?
- Yes. [exhales]

2016
01:39:36,208 --> 01:39:39,375
- I think so. It's admirable.
- [scoffs]

2017
01:39:40,250 --> 01:39:41,916
[young woman] Youth is admirable?

2018
01:39:44,041 --> 01:39:46,458
How can you admire a person for their age?

2019
01:39:46,833 --> 01:39:49,583
It's like admiring a certain point
in a stream.

2020
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:52,458
It's healthier,

2021
01:39:53,083 --> 01:39:54,208
it's brighter,

2022
01:39:55,250 --> 01:39:56,583
it's more fun.

2023
01:39:57,333 --> 01:39:59,166
More attractive, hopeful.

2024
01:40:00,125 --> 01:40:01,708
[young woman]
Like a Coca-Cola commercial.

2025
01:40:01,791 --> 01:40:03,875
Almost all groundbreaking work

2026
01:40:04,833 --> 01:40:07,791
in science and the arts
is done by young people.

2027
01:40:07,875 --> 01:40:10,125
Old people are the ash heap of youth.

2028
01:40:10,208 --> 01:40:12,375
Listen, Jake,
I-I'm thinking that we need to...

2029
01:40:12,458 --> 01:40:13,500
Ta-da!

2030
01:40:15,500 --> 01:40:18,083
[young woman] Wow.
I didn't expect anything so enormous.

2031
01:40:18,166 --> 01:40:20,500
[Jake] One hundred and thirty classrooms,

2032
01:40:20,583 --> 01:40:24,041
a gymnasium, two locker rooms,
boys, girls,

2033
01:40:24,125 --> 01:40:27,708
auditorium, ten bathrooms,
six administrative offices,

2034
01:40:28,375 --> 01:40:29,458
teachers' lounge,

2035
01:40:30,291 --> 01:40:31,333
counselor's center.

2036
01:40:31,416 --> 01:40:34,333
- [wind whistling]
- It's regional, so 11 towns feed into it.

2037
01:40:35,125 --> 01:40:36,750
Well, you certainly know your high school.

2038
01:40:36,833 --> 01:40:38,166
Like the back of my hand.

2039
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:42,166
[wind whistling]

2040
01:40:45,166 --> 01:40:47,375
- There's someone here.
- School maintenance?

2041
01:40:47,458 --> 01:40:48,958
Janitor? Something.

2042
01:40:49,458 --> 01:40:50,291
Ah.

2043
01:40:50,375 --> 01:40:51,416
What?

2044
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:52,333
There.

2045
01:40:52,666 --> 01:40:54,833
- Trash can. I knew it. Be right back.
- [car door opens]

2046
01:40:54,916 --> 01:40:56,000
[wind howling]

2047
01:41:03,291 --> 01:41:04,625
[windscreen wiper squeaks]

2048
01:41:11,666 --> 01:41:12,791
[young woman sighs]

2049
01:41:13,750 --> 01:41:14,958
[sighs]

2050
01:41:17,625 --> 01:41:18,625
[young woman sighs]

2051
01:41:19,458 --> 01:41:20,666
[wind howling]

2052
01:41:24,958 --> 01:41:26,125
Come on!

2053
01:41:26,833 --> 01:41:27,750
Good. Yes, yes!

2054
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:31,916
Where were you?

2055
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:35,750
That bin was filled with road salt
for the...

2056
01:41:36,500 --> 01:41:37,333
ice.

2057
01:41:37,750 --> 01:41:39,000
I remembered there's a...

2058
01:41:39,375 --> 01:41:42,083
a dumpster on the other side
near the loading docks.

2059
01:41:42,541 --> 01:41:44,250
- Mission accomplished.
- Let's go.

2060
01:41:44,333 --> 01:41:45,333
It's humid in here.

2061
01:41:48,708 --> 01:41:50,083
[Jake sighs]

2062
01:41:52,083 --> 01:41:53,083
Kind of peaceful.

2063
01:41:53,166 --> 01:41:55,375
More creepy than peaceful, I'd say.

2064
01:41:55,458 --> 01:41:56,958
- I don't agree.
- I want to go.

2065
01:41:57,041 --> 01:41:59,041
- What's the rush all of a sudden?
- All of the sudden?

2066
01:41:59,125 --> 01:42:03,083
I've been like a broken record all night,
telling you that I wanted to go home.

2067
01:42:03,166 --> 01:42:07,625
I've given you like 40 reasons
why I need to get back tonight.

2068
01:42:07,708 --> 01:42:08,583
[Jake grunts]

2069
01:42:14,708 --> 01:42:16,416
- I guess that's true.
- You guess?

2070
01:42:17,750 --> 01:42:19,083
[inhales deeply]

2071
01:42:19,166 --> 01:42:20,541
I just thought... [exhales]

2072
01:42:20,625 --> 01:42:21,500
You know.

2073
01:42:23,875 --> 01:42:26,208
It's peaceful and quiet here.

2074
01:42:29,750 --> 01:42:31,291
Baby, it's cold outside.

2075
01:42:32,208 --> 01:42:33,041
Really?

2076
01:42:35,541 --> 01:42:37,416
You're gonna quote a rape song at me?

2077
01:42:38,125 --> 01:42:39,083
[scoffs]

2078
01:42:39,166 --> 01:42:40,083
It's not a...

2079
01:42:40,625 --> 01:42:41,750
it's not a rape song.

2080
01:42:41,833 --> 01:42:44,375
She keeps saying she wants to leave.
He keeps ignoring her.

2081
01:42:44,458 --> 01:42:45,708
What would you call that?

2082
01:42:47,583 --> 01:42:50,875
She wants to stay. She's just afraid
of what people will think.

2083
01:42:50,958 --> 01:42:53,833
She asks him, "What have you put
in my damn drink?"

2084
01:42:54,208 --> 01:42:57,875
Jesus. The song was written in 1936.

2085
01:42:57,958 --> 01:43:00,166
[chuckling] It's not about roofies!

2086
01:43:00,250 --> 01:43:03,416
Roofies or not, he's trying to break down
her defenses with strong liquor.

2087
01:43:03,500 --> 01:43:05,750
And anyway, they had mickeys in the '30s.

2088
01:43:05,833 --> 01:43:07,291
It's a song about coercion.

2089
01:43:09,666 --> 01:43:11,750
I don't know why you're getting so angry.

2090
01:43:11,833 --> 01:43:12,875
I just want to go home.

2091
01:43:12,958 --> 01:43:15,625
- To the farmhouse?
- Not to the fucking farmhouse,

2092
01:43:15,708 --> 01:43:16,875
to my house!

2093
01:43:17,416 --> 01:43:18,916
Jake, my house!

2094
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:20,250
- OK.
- [keys jangle]

2095
01:43:20,333 --> 01:43:22,208
- [engine turns over]
- [young woman] Thank you.

2096
01:43:22,291 --> 01:43:24,916
And then... and then he says,
"what's the point in hurting my pride,"

2097
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,666
like it's her job to make this guy
feel sexually attractive.

2098
01:43:27,750 --> 01:43:29,666
Regardless of her own desires,
like that's...

2099
01:43:29,750 --> 01:43:31,291
like that's her responsibility.

2100
01:43:31,375 --> 01:43:32,416
I see that.

2101
01:43:34,541 --> 01:43:36,583
You have convinced me. I'm sorry.

2102
01:43:48,958 --> 01:43:50,000
I'm sorry.

2103
01:43:50,083 --> 01:43:51,375
[wind howling]

2104
01:43:53,125 --> 01:43:54,041
It's all right.

2105
01:44:02,500 --> 01:44:04,333
[smooching]

2106
01:44:04,416 --> 01:44:05,666
[young woman chuckles slightly]

2107
01:44:14,250 --> 01:44:15,416
- [voice loudly echoing]
- Jesus.

2108
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:16,708
What? What?

2109
01:44:17,875 --> 01:44:19,333
There was someone watching us.

2110
01:44:19,416 --> 01:44:21,541
- I didn't see anyone.
- [Jake] Well, he was watching us.

2111
01:44:21,625 --> 01:44:23,083
Like... like a goddamn pervert.

2112
01:44:23,166 --> 01:44:25,250
- Let's go.
- [Jake] Believe me, I'm very familiar

2113
01:44:25,333 --> 01:44:26,708
with that particular look.

2114
01:44:26,791 --> 01:44:29,458
Jake, I just...
What the hell does that mean?

2115
01:44:29,541 --> 01:44:31,166
I'm going to give him a piece of my mind.

2116
01:44:31,250 --> 01:44:33,166
- Jake, don't be ridiculous.
- It's not acceptable.

2117
01:44:33,250 --> 01:44:35,041
- [young woman] Jake, let's just go.
- No.

2118
01:44:35,125 --> 01:44:38,375
- [young woman] You don't...
- [stammers] I'll be right back. This...

2119
01:44:41,791 --> 01:44:42,625
- It...
- [honks horn]

2120
01:44:42,708 --> 01:44:44,875
- It's unacceptable!
- Let's go! Jake, let's just go!

2121
01:44:44,958 --> 01:44:47,625
- [Jake] I'll be right back.
- Don't! Jake! Don't, please!

2122
01:44:47,708 --> 01:44:48,666
[car door closes]

2123
01:44:50,166 --> 01:44:51,000
[yells] Jake!

2124
01:44:51,958 --> 01:44:53,000
[banging]

2125
01:44:53,083 --> 01:44:54,166
Crap!

2126
01:44:56,458 --> 01:44:57,708
[young woman sighs]

2127
01:44:57,791 --> 01:44:59,666
Oh, I shouldn't have come.
I shouldn't have come.

2128
01:45:02,375 --> 01:45:04,125
[yells] Aah, fuck!

2129
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:07,583
[wind howling]

2130
01:45:10,208 --> 01:45:12,791
It's hard to say no.
I was never taught that.

2131
01:45:13,958 --> 01:45:15,625
It's easier just to say yes.

2132
01:45:16,916 --> 01:45:18,708
Anyway, sometimes
you're just caught off guard.

2133
01:45:18,791 --> 01:45:20,958
And the request comes,
can I have your number?

2134
01:45:21,041 --> 01:45:22,916
And the easiest way out of it
is just to say yes,

2135
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,916
and then that yes turns into more yes,
and then it's yes, yes, yes.

2136
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:27,083
[wind whistling]

2137
01:45:30,583 --> 01:45:32,250
[laughing]

2138
01:45:37,083 --> 01:45:38,375
[wind whistling]

2139
01:45:39,625 --> 01:45:41,166
He's not a monster, he...

2140
01:45:44,166 --> 01:45:45,166
[car door opens]

2141
01:45:46,666 --> 01:45:47,500
Jake?

2142
01:45:50,416 --> 01:45:51,333
[car door closes]

2143
01:45:51,833 --> 01:45:52,875
[sighs]

2144
01:45:58,083 --> 01:45:59,250
He doesn't beat you.

2145
01:46:00,208 --> 01:46:01,041
Right?

2146
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:04,875
I'm certain the sex has been good.

2147
01:46:04,958 --> 01:46:06,333
At least some of the time.

2148
01:46:06,791 --> 01:46:07,625
Just...

2149
01:46:08,375 --> 01:46:09,375
[sighs]

2150
01:46:09,458 --> 01:46:11,750
How long does it take to get hypothermia?

2151
01:46:12,958 --> 01:46:13,791
Eh...

2152
01:46:15,291 --> 01:46:17,875
Maybe it's not a bad way to go
if I have to go.

2153
01:46:18,916 --> 01:46:20,125
[wind howling]

2154
01:46:25,291 --> 01:46:26,208
[slight grunt]

2155
01:46:30,041 --> 01:46:30,916
[shivering]

2156
01:46:34,083 --> 01:46:34,916
Jake?

2157
01:46:36,541 --> 01:46:37,375
Jake?

2158
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,166
[yells] Jake!

2159
01:46:42,375 --> 01:46:45,333
[yelling] Shit, shit, shit!

2160
01:46:46,875 --> 01:46:48,083
Oh, my God.

2161
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:51,291
Piece of shit! Shit!

2162
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:53,416
Shit, shit!

2163
01:46:54,500 --> 01:46:55,416
[panting]

2164
01:46:59,458 --> 01:47:00,333
Oh, God.

2165
01:47:04,416 --> 01:47:05,833
[shivering]

2166
01:47:06,458 --> 01:47:08,500
[shivering and breathing heavily]

2167
01:47:24,708 --> 01:47:26,416
[shivering]

2168
01:47:37,625 --> 01:47:39,375
[serene instrumental music playing]

2169
01:47:53,333 --> 01:47:54,375
[keys jangling]

2170
01:47:54,458 --> 01:47:55,791
[cart clattering]

2171
01:48:21,625 --> 01:48:22,458
Jake?

2172
01:48:26,750 --> 01:48:29,166
Jake, I wanna go. Please?

2173
01:48:31,541 --> 01:48:32,750
[tense music plays]

2174
01:48:44,375 --> 01:48:46,041
[keys jangling]

2175
01:48:54,291 --> 01:48:55,583
[grunting]

2176
01:48:56,625 --> 01:48:57,708
[humming]

2177
01:49:01,791 --> 01:49:02,791
[janitor] Ah.

2178
01:49:04,166 --> 01:49:05,416
[continues humming]

2179
01:49:07,166 --> 01:49:09,166
[janitor mutters indistinctly]

2180
01:49:19,833 --> 01:49:20,666
Oh...

2181
01:49:21,750 --> 01:49:22,583
Hello.

2182
01:49:22,666 --> 01:49:23,541
[breathing heavily]

2183
01:49:24,208 --> 01:49:25,083
Hello.

2184
01:49:26,208 --> 01:49:28,041
I'm sorry. M-My...

2185
01:49:28,125 --> 01:49:29,333
My boyfriend came in here.

2186
01:49:29,416 --> 01:49:32,000
I think he went to school here
a while back.

2187
01:49:32,083 --> 01:49:32,916
[shaky inhale]

2188
01:49:34,833 --> 01:49:36,791
Maybe you know him, I.. I... I don't...

2189
01:49:36,875 --> 01:49:39,208
I don't... I don't know
if you were here when...

2190
01:49:39,291 --> 01:49:40,666
when he was a student.

2191
01:49:40,750 --> 01:49:43,041
I mean, how would I know? Anyway, I...

2192
01:49:43,500 --> 01:49:45,750
You haven't seen anyone around here,
have you?

2193
01:49:47,083 --> 01:49:49,166
[janitor] <i>What does your boyfriend</i>
<i>look like?</i>

2194
01:49:53,916 --> 01:49:55,625
It's hard to describe people.

2195
01:50:00,041 --> 01:50:02,583
It was so long ago, I barely remember.

2196
01:50:03,791 --> 01:50:04,625
I mean...

2197
01:50:07,833 --> 01:50:09,125
We never even talked,

2198
01:50:09,666 --> 01:50:12,958
is the truth. I'm not even sure
I registered him. There's a lot of people.

2199
01:50:13,041 --> 01:50:14,708
I was there with my girlfriend...

2200
01:50:15,208 --> 01:50:16,791
We were celebrating our anniversary,

2201
01:50:16,875 --> 01:50:18,875
stopped in for a drink,
and then this guy

2202
01:50:19,208 --> 01:50:20,375
kept looking at me.

2203
01:50:20,875 --> 01:50:22,125
It's a nuisance.

2204
01:50:22,541 --> 01:50:25,000
The occupational hazard of...
of being a female.

2205
01:50:25,083 --> 01:50:27,416
You can't even go for a drink.
Always being looked at.

2206
01:50:27,500 --> 01:50:29,500
He was a creeper! You know?

2207
01:50:31,541 --> 01:50:34,750
[stammers] And I remember thinking,
I wish my boyfriend was here.

2208
01:50:35,416 --> 01:50:36,583
Which is...

2209
01:50:36,666 --> 01:50:37,625
That's sort of sad,

2210
01:50:37,708 --> 01:50:40,500
that being a woman,
the only way a guy leaves you alone

2211
01:50:40,583 --> 01:50:42,000
is if you're with another guy.

2212
01:50:42,083 --> 01:50:43,083
Like, if... like...

2213
01:50:43,166 --> 01:50:45,541
like you've been claimed.
Like you're property, even then.

2214
01:50:45,625 --> 01:50:46,708
Anyway, I can't...

2215
01:50:48,083 --> 01:50:50,125
I can't remember what he looks like.

2216
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:53,000
Why would I?

2217
01:50:54,958 --> 01:50:56,125
Nothing happened.

2218
01:50:58,208 --> 01:50:59,250
Maybe it was just...

2219
01:50:59,791 --> 01:51:00,625
[sniffs]

2220
01:51:00,958 --> 01:51:02,083
I think it was just...

2221
01:51:02,458 --> 01:51:07,041
Just one of thousands
of such non-interactions in my life.

2222
01:51:13,708 --> 01:51:15,416
[laughing]

2223
01:51:15,500 --> 01:51:18,958
It's like asking me to describe
a mosquito that bit me

2224
01:51:19,041 --> 01:51:21,000
on an evening 40 years ago.

2225
01:51:23,583 --> 01:51:24,500
[sighs]

2226
01:51:28,416 --> 01:51:31,625
Well, you haven't seen anyone
fitting that description, have you?

2227
01:51:31,708 --> 01:51:32,958
I haven't seen anyone.

2228
01:51:35,291 --> 01:51:36,250
[young woman] OK.

2229
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:37,833
I mean...

2230
01:51:38,500 --> 01:51:40,041
except you. I see you.

2231
01:51:50,375 --> 01:51:51,250
I'm... I'm...

2232
01:51:52,666 --> 01:51:54,291
I'm a little worried about him.

2233
01:51:55,833 --> 01:51:57,791
I'm sure there's no need.

2234
01:51:59,583 --> 01:52:01,208
He's safe if he's here.

2235
01:52:02,333 --> 01:52:03,541
It's safe in here.

2236
01:52:04,583 --> 01:52:05,750
It's quiet.

2237
01:52:12,541 --> 01:52:14,250
[young woman humming softly]

2238
01:52:17,708 --> 01:52:19,375
[inhales deeply]

2239
01:52:26,708 --> 01:52:28,791
Is it OK if I look around for him?

2240
01:52:33,791 --> 01:52:36,916
Maybe take your wet shoes off.
I've just cleaned the floors.

2241
01:52:44,541 --> 01:52:45,375
No...

2242
01:52:46,666 --> 01:52:47,708
They're yours.

2243
01:52:50,750 --> 01:52:51,583
[chuckles]

2244
01:52:57,250 --> 01:52:58,625
[footsteps departing]

2245
01:53:08,583 --> 01:53:09,416
Bye.

2246
01:53:10,625 --> 01:53:11,458
Yeah.

2247
01:53:12,333 --> 01:53:13,166
Bye.

2248
01:53:13,500 --> 01:53:16,208
[young woman chuckling]

2249
01:53:26,541 --> 01:53:28,000
[tense music plays]

2250
01:53:30,416 --> 01:53:31,250
Jake?

2251
01:53:33,791 --> 01:53:34,625
