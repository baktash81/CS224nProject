00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,695
Once upon a time,
a beautiful young girl

3
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:53,532
grew up hidden away
in a convent

4
00:01:53,566 --> 00:01:55,836
by the edge of the sea.

5
00:01:55,868 --> 00:01:56,903
Marie-Josephe!

6
00:01:58,863 --> 00:02:00,330
Marie-Josephe!

7
00:02:01,741 --> 00:02:04,709
Her very existence
was a secret,

8
00:02:04,744 --> 00:02:07,948
for she was
the king's daughter.

9
00:02:09,415 --> 00:02:10,750
Marie-Josephe!

10
00:02:10,784 --> 00:02:13,053
From a very
early age,

11
00:02:13,086 --> 00:02:15,454
she was drawn to the water.

12
00:02:15,487 --> 00:02:18,725
Much to the dismay of
the convent's strict nuns

13
00:02:18,758 --> 00:02:22,695
who did their best
to shelter her from the world.

14
00:02:22,729 --> 00:02:26,867
How often have you been
warned not to swim in the sea?

15
00:02:26,899 --> 00:02:28,534
Very often.

16
00:02:28,567 --> 00:02:31,003
And my previous punishments...

17
00:02:31,037 --> 00:02:33,740
revoking your riding privileges,

18
00:02:33,773 --> 00:02:38,111
burning your beloved cello,
none were enough to deter you?

19
00:02:38,144 --> 00:02:40,012
It is Satan's voice
which calls you

20
00:02:40,046 --> 00:02:41,181
to the unholy sea.

21
00:02:41,214 --> 00:02:42,581
No.

22
00:02:42,615 --> 00:02:44,851
Abbess, it is
a simple joy of nature.

23
00:02:44,885 --> 00:02:45,886
- Silence.
- It is.

24
00:02:45,918 --> 00:02:48,454
Silence, I said.

25
00:02:53,692 --> 00:02:56,863
Meanwhile,
at the palace of Versailles,

26
00:02:56,897 --> 00:03:00,466
Marie-Josephe's
father King Louis XIV,

27
00:03:00,499 --> 00:03:03,136
King of France,
had recently returned

28
00:03:03,169 --> 00:03:05,604
victorious
from an expensive war

29
00:03:05,638 --> 00:03:07,741
that had dragged on for years.

30
00:03:08,808 --> 00:03:11,510
Our troops have been fighting

31
00:03:11,543 --> 00:03:13,914
with exceptional
skill and courage.

32
00:03:16,681 --> 00:03:19,920
It has been
the greatest honor for me

33
00:03:19,952 --> 00:03:21,788
to stand beside each...

34
00:03:26,893 --> 00:03:29,095
France
still had enemies.

35
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:33,532
And that night, the man
also known as the Sun King,

36
00:03:33,565 --> 00:03:36,937
learned that even
he would not live forever.

37
00:03:49,248 --> 00:03:50,582
Now...

38
00:03:51,151 --> 00:03:52,152
Where was I?

39
00:03:56,255 --> 00:03:58,456
Few inches to the right...

40
00:03:59,292 --> 00:04:00,860
would have found your heart.

41
00:04:00,893 --> 00:04:02,995
If France loses you...

42
00:04:04,096 --> 00:04:05,799
it will be catastrophic.

43
00:04:05,832 --> 00:04:08,633
- Not to mention lonely for me.
- Hmm.

44
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:11,270
There is a possible solution.

45
00:04:11,304 --> 00:04:15,607
I've been investigating
certain properties

46
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,844
of an organ in a legendary
sea creature.

47
00:04:17,877 --> 00:04:18,979
A fish?

48
00:04:19,912 --> 00:04:21,247
That's your solution?

49
00:04:23,282 --> 00:04:26,585
If the question
is the king's mortality...

50
00:04:26,618 --> 00:04:28,754
this creature
could hold the key.

51
00:04:31,725 --> 00:04:33,692
And with that
the Sun King

52
00:04:33,727 --> 00:04:35,694
commissioned a risky expedition

53
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:39,265
to find the underwater
lost city of Atlantis

54
00:04:39,298 --> 00:04:42,102
and its fabled mermaids.

55
00:04:42,134 --> 00:04:46,006
Believing they held
the key of life everlasting.

56
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:52,611
For this dangerous mission,
a courageous captain

57
00:04:52,644 --> 00:04:56,048
was sent to search
the far reaches of the seas.

58
00:05:09,962 --> 00:05:11,063
I think I saw it.

59
00:05:11,931 --> 00:05:12,932
Due North.

60
00:05:14,134 --> 00:05:15,700
Are you sure?

61
00:05:15,735 --> 00:05:17,937
Only if you believe
in the unbelievable.

62
00:05:19,638 --> 00:05:21,706
Ready the barrels!

63
00:05:22,607 --> 00:05:24,176
Ready the barrels!

64
00:05:29,382 --> 00:05:30,983
Lower the nets.

65
00:05:32,718 --> 00:05:34,619
Drop them both now.

66
00:05:36,188 --> 00:05:39,557
- Fire!
- Fire!

67
00:05:46,032 --> 00:05:48,700
- Heave!
- Pull!

68
00:05:53,073 --> 00:05:54,639
Heave!

69
00:05:55,341 --> 00:05:56,375
Up!

70
00:06:08,854 --> 00:06:10,323
It's gonna kill us all!

71
00:06:10,356 --> 00:06:11,690
No!

72
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,729
We only need the female.

73
00:06:18,197 --> 00:06:19,932
Let the male go.

74
00:06:27,672 --> 00:06:30,142
So,
Captain Yves De La Croix

75
00:06:30,176 --> 00:06:34,046
sent word of the amazing
capture back to Versailles

76
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,149
on the wings
of the royal carrier pigeons.

77
00:06:49,996 --> 00:06:52,331
Fantastic news, Your Majesty.

78
00:06:52,365 --> 00:06:55,835
De la Croix's ship
sails for home...

79
00:06:55,868 --> 00:06:59,405
in possession
of the miraculous cargo.

80
00:06:59,438 --> 00:07:01,774
The coming eclipse
is perfect timing.

81
00:07:01,807 --> 00:07:03,843
The books are clear
about these matters

82
00:07:03,876 --> 00:07:06,178
and specify that the creature
must be sacrificed

83
00:07:06,212 --> 00:07:08,781
right as the moon passes
in front of the sun.

84
00:07:08,814 --> 00:07:11,417
In order to transfer
its gift of eternal life.

85
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:14,220
Perhaps we should
withhold our glee, Dr. Labarthe,

86
00:07:14,253 --> 00:07:17,390
until we have proof that
your books are not just fiction.

87
00:07:17,423 --> 00:07:19,159
Relax, Father.

88
00:07:19,191 --> 00:07:22,261
Surely, the doctor wouldn't
be risking his reputation

89
00:07:22,294 --> 00:07:24,930
on this outlandish claim

90
00:07:24,964 --> 00:07:27,199
unless he was feeling
very confident.

91
00:07:33,272 --> 00:07:35,941
Port Le Harve,
dead ahead, captain!

92
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,816
The King's
closest minister

93
00:07:43,849 --> 00:07:46,452
had serious doubts
about the doctor's plan

94
00:07:46,485 --> 00:07:47,853
for the mermaid.

95
00:07:47,887 --> 00:07:49,355
And as fate would have it

96
00:07:49,388 --> 00:07:51,090
he had just requested

97
00:07:51,123 --> 00:07:54,727
that the King's daughter
attend the world celebration

98
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,896
of the coming solar eclipse.

99
00:07:56,929 --> 00:08:00,866
Father, a response from
the Convent de St. Helene.

100
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,902
Give me the girl's files.

101
00:08:07,907 --> 00:08:10,910
It seems the Abbess can't
wait to grant us our request.

102
00:08:14,413 --> 00:08:16,148
And on the next day,

103
00:08:16,182 --> 00:08:18,084
Father La Chaise
went to retrieve

104
00:08:18,117 --> 00:08:20,086
the King's long lost daughter.

105
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:23,756
Thus, starting Marie-Josephe's
great adventure.

106
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,293
She has become
incurably defiant.

107
00:08:27,326 --> 00:08:28,828
Immune to all discipline.

108
00:08:28,861 --> 00:08:30,429
Your reports
over the years

109
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:33,099
have told of
a prodigious musical talent.

110
00:08:33,132 --> 00:08:35,835
A soul poised
in devotion to God.

111
00:08:35,868 --> 00:08:38,404
Throughout her childhood, yes.
But she's become...

112
00:08:38,437 --> 00:08:40,106
Dear Abbess...

113
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:42,508
I need to know
whether her talents

114
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:45,945
might be welcomed in court.

115
00:09:00,126 --> 00:09:02,228
You are leaving us,
Marie-Josephe.

116
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:08,567
Where am I going?

117
00:09:08,601 --> 00:09:11,103
To a lavish
and glimmering hell...

118
00:09:12,138 --> 00:09:15,174
where you will
no doubt thrive.

119
00:09:32,391 --> 00:09:33,993
Do you serve the King?

120
00:09:34,026 --> 00:09:36,896
No, I work for the King.

121
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:41,867
I serve God.

122
00:09:41,901 --> 00:09:44,203
Are you taking me
to meet the King or God?

123
00:09:56,948 --> 00:09:59,084
I always heard
the tales of Versailles.

124
00:10:00,952 --> 00:10:03,322
I never imagined
it would be quite so...

125
00:10:03,355 --> 00:10:05,191
Magnificent?

126
00:10:05,224 --> 00:10:06,825
The stuff of dreams.

127
00:10:20,605 --> 00:10:22,240
Magali, please.

128
00:10:30,082 --> 00:10:32,218
Marie-Josephe d'Alembert.

129
00:10:33,618 --> 00:10:35,054
This is Magali.

130
00:10:35,087 --> 00:10:36,088
Bonjour.

131
00:10:36,121 --> 00:10:38,023
Please show her to her room.

132
00:10:39,624 --> 00:10:41,460
No. We're not in the Chateau.

133
00:10:42,494 --> 00:10:43,995
This way, Mademoiselle.

134
00:10:47,967 --> 00:10:50,069
Sire, it is the hour.

135
00:10:56,609 --> 00:10:59,211
Boring!

136
00:10:59,245 --> 00:11:02,214
I can write better
music than that.

137
00:11:02,248 --> 00:11:05,650
Maybe you should compose
your own music, majesty.

138
00:11:05,684 --> 00:11:07,953
Maybe I should be my own priest.

139
00:11:07,987 --> 00:11:11,357
Find me a composer
who's fresh, exciting.

140
00:11:13,658 --> 00:11:16,962
- No hurry.
- No hurry... meaning?

141
00:11:16,996 --> 00:11:19,265
- Immediately.
- Ah.

142
00:11:23,068 --> 00:11:25,036
Shall we start our day?

143
00:11:31,243 --> 00:11:34,079
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

144
00:11:34,113 --> 00:11:38,017
I shared my bed last night
with Madame Scarron.

145
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,019
Devereaux.

146
00:11:40,051 --> 00:11:42,554
That was Madame Devereaux.

147
00:11:42,587 --> 00:11:46,425
I don't think so.
Devereaux is an intellectual.

148
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,059
She's also a brunette.

149
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,733
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

150
00:11:53,767 --> 00:11:57,236
I shared my bed last night
with Madame Devereaux.

151
00:11:58,203 --> 00:11:59,938
You shall be forgiven.

152
00:12:03,341 --> 00:12:05,110
To have earned private
quarters so quickly

153
00:12:05,144 --> 00:12:07,112
is a magnificent feat.

154
00:12:07,146 --> 00:12:08,447
I doubt I've earned anything.

155
00:12:10,081 --> 00:12:12,717
Humility will get you nowhere
at Court, Mademoiselle.

156
00:12:12,752 --> 00:12:15,487
Color and bravado
are the order of the day.

157
00:12:17,222 --> 00:12:19,958
Look at those girls.
I don't fit in here.

158
00:12:21,026 --> 00:12:23,028
It's my job to see
that you will.

159
00:12:42,448 --> 00:12:45,383
All ladies'
chambers face East...

160
00:12:45,417 --> 00:12:49,020
so that each awakens with a
ray of the King on her cheek.

161
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,224
It's the last piece
she wrote

162
00:12:52,257 --> 00:12:54,659
at the convent, Your Majesty.

163
00:12:54,693 --> 00:12:56,362
I am not the one to judge

164
00:12:56,394 --> 00:12:58,663
whether or not her
skills are good enough.

165
00:12:58,697 --> 00:13:01,233
She is not without talent.

166
00:13:01,266 --> 00:13:04,103
And remember,
she has no formal training.

167
00:13:04,135 --> 00:13:05,739
I'm speaking of talent.

168
00:13:05,771 --> 00:13:07,773
The stuff one is made of.

169
00:13:07,807 --> 00:13:09,508
I will meet her tomorrow.

170
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:13,345
And remember, no one
must know she's my daughter.

171
00:13:20,119 --> 00:13:22,521
So how long were
you at the convent?

172
00:13:22,554 --> 00:13:23,757
Since birth.

173
00:13:23,789 --> 00:13:25,290
I never knew my parents.

174
00:13:25,323 --> 00:13:27,192
Were you taken from them...

175
00:13:27,226 --> 00:13:28,660
like I was from mine?

176
00:13:28,693 --> 00:13:30,161
No.

177
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:32,430
I was left there.

178
00:13:33,164 --> 00:13:35,234
How poetic.

179
00:13:35,267 --> 00:13:37,771
Trauma at the start of life

180
00:13:37,803 --> 00:13:40,238
often inspires greatness.

181
00:13:41,573 --> 00:13:43,475
Sometimes I think
the trauma was greater

182
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:45,411
for the Abbess
than it was for me.

183
00:13:51,316 --> 00:13:53,084
Your Majesty's,
first honor this morning

184
00:13:53,118 --> 00:13:55,687
is bestowed on
Monsieur Jean-Michel Lintillac,

185
00:13:55,721 --> 00:14:00,191
son of the lace and export
baron, Pierre Lintillac.

186
00:14:02,528 --> 00:14:03,839
I feel a sense of
awe standing here

187
00:14:03,863 --> 00:14:05,297
in the light of the Sun King.

188
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:07,699
A light cast for all France.

189
00:14:07,733 --> 00:14:09,367
For all France!

190
00:14:09,401 --> 00:14:11,303
I come to show my gratitude.

191
00:14:11,336 --> 00:14:12,838
Our nation's gratitude

192
00:14:12,872 --> 00:14:14,706
for your recent
military triumph.

193
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,176
It is God's triumph.

194
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:21,112
And... our brave soldiers.

195
00:14:21,146 --> 00:14:22,882
In honor of your
upcoming birthday, Majesty,

196
00:14:22,915 --> 00:14:25,150
let me offer this gift.

197
00:14:25,184 --> 00:14:28,420
My father's dearest possession.

198
00:14:28,454 --> 00:14:30,488
Forged from rare
Chinese diamonds.

199
00:14:32,324 --> 00:14:34,727
How I dislike birthdays.

200
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,196
They remind me of mortality.

201
00:14:37,228 --> 00:14:38,406
It will also remind you
of your

202
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:41,232
soul's immortality,
Your Majesty.

203
00:14:41,266 --> 00:14:44,838
I am not worried about
my soul. Well, not just yet.

204
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:48,139
So, tell me, how
is your dear father?

205
00:14:48,173 --> 00:14:50,308
He's ready to pass
from this world to the next.

206
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,277
I see.

207
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,582
Perhaps there is more
to do with the boy.

208
00:14:58,884 --> 00:15:00,219
Meaning?

209
00:15:00,251 --> 00:15:02,387
This war has
depleted the treasury.

210
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,322
Well, why don't we just turn
the boy upside-down

211
00:15:04,356 --> 00:15:06,191
and see what falls
from his pockets?

212
00:15:06,225 --> 00:15:08,560
He stands to inherit a fortune.

213
00:15:08,593 --> 00:15:10,896
You're being secretive
and enigmatic.

214
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:13,632
Inappropriate behavior
for anyone but me.

215
00:15:14,934 --> 00:15:17,335
Do you believe in coincidence?

216
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,271
Or fate?

217
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:25,477
Why is everyone staring?

218
00:15:25,511 --> 00:15:27,780
Appearance
is everything.

219
00:15:27,813 --> 00:15:31,249
- Appearance?
- Yes, Mademoiselle.

220
00:15:31,282 --> 00:15:33,318
They'd rather gossip about you

221
00:15:33,351 --> 00:15:36,388
than reflect on the emptiness
of their own lives.

222
00:15:36,421 --> 00:15:37,890
Being kicked out of a convent

223
00:15:37,923 --> 00:15:40,158
is hardly the making
of a fairy tale.

224
00:15:40,692 --> 00:15:41,794
Perhaps.

225
00:15:41,827 --> 00:15:43,662
But the fact that the King

226
00:15:43,695 --> 00:15:47,432
had you brought here
makes you an object of intrigue.

227
00:15:47,465 --> 00:15:49,668
Second only
to some secret surprise

228
00:15:49,701 --> 00:15:52,538
he has planned
for the coming solar eclipse.

229
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:55,273
The King owns
the eclipse too, does he?

230
00:15:56,542 --> 00:15:58,544
I guess when one rules
over the moon and the sun

231
00:15:58,576 --> 00:16:01,379
he's entitled to schedule
their rendezvous.

232
00:16:12,323 --> 00:16:13,826
Do you have
a favorite fountain?

233
00:16:13,859 --> 00:16:16,394
Yes. The fountain of Flora.

234
00:16:16,428 --> 00:16:17,797
It's right over there.

235
00:16:29,674 --> 00:16:31,476
Isn't she beautiful?

236
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,755
Mademoiselle, be careful.

237
00:16:47,358 --> 00:16:48,493
Mademoiselle!

238
00:16:49,729 --> 00:16:50,796
The King!

239
00:17:06,578 --> 00:17:08,413
Allow me, mademoiselle.

240
00:17:12,484 --> 00:17:13,853
Are you okay?

241
00:17:16,521 --> 00:17:18,523
Marie-Josephe.

242
00:17:18,556 --> 00:17:21,794
Present yourself before
the King, if you please.

243
00:17:36,108 --> 00:17:38,443
Might we remove that shock
from your face

244
00:17:38,476 --> 00:17:40,445
and offer a smile?

245
00:17:52,557 --> 00:17:54,559
Do you have a genuine smile...

246
00:17:55,995 --> 00:17:57,629
hidden somewhere?

247
00:17:59,531 --> 00:18:01,399
No regrets, Mademoiselle.

248
00:18:01,432 --> 00:18:02,802
That statue is of a woman

249
00:18:02,835 --> 00:18:05,370
who has caused many
to lose their balance.

250
00:18:08,406 --> 00:18:09,541
Although...

251
00:18:10,776 --> 00:18:11,844
mostly men.

252
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:21,053
No need to bother, Mademoiselle.

253
00:18:21,086 --> 00:18:22,586
I have another one.

254
00:18:24,588 --> 00:18:27,559
Move into quarters
befitting my new composer.

255
00:18:41,639 --> 00:18:43,975
Have we died
and gone to Heaven?

256
00:18:44,009 --> 00:18:46,846
I think so.

257
00:18:46,878 --> 00:18:49,881
We are now in the chateau

258
00:18:49,915 --> 00:18:53,585
among the truly privileged.

259
00:18:53,617 --> 00:18:56,688
And I've been appointed
your lady-in-waiting.

260
00:18:58,858 --> 00:19:01,358
It's all so magnificent.

261
00:19:06,065 --> 00:19:08,499
If you could choose only one,

262
00:19:08,533 --> 00:19:09,901
which would it be?

263
00:19:12,137 --> 00:19:14,439
They're all so beautiful.

264
00:19:15,741 --> 00:19:16,741
But...

265
00:19:18,177 --> 00:19:19,945
I choose my cello.

266
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,513
My freedom.

267
00:19:57,615 --> 00:19:58,984
- Steady.
- Hold it.

268
00:20:13,098 --> 00:20:15,801
The King built all this

269
00:20:15,834 --> 00:20:19,038
to bring water to Versailles
from the ocean via the Seine.

270
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,538
Those are a system of valves

271
00:20:20,571 --> 00:20:22,942
that regulate
the various fountains.

272
00:20:22,974 --> 00:20:26,077
There is the path
to the underground river,

273
00:20:26,111 --> 00:20:28,814
brings all the water here.

274
00:20:28,847 --> 00:20:31,850
"After the male
was returned to the sea,

275
00:20:31,883 --> 00:20:35,720
the female fell into
a dark and lethargic trance."

276
00:20:35,754 --> 00:20:37,989
A seaman's drunken commentary.

277
00:20:40,025 --> 00:20:41,193
There were two of them?

278
00:20:41,226 --> 00:20:42,593
Yes, Majesty.

279
00:20:42,626 --> 00:20:45,496
But the male is useless
for our purpose.

280
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:48,133
Only the female possesses
the infinite light source.

281
00:20:48,167 --> 00:20:51,703
What you propose, doctor,
is sacrilegious.

282
00:20:51,736 --> 00:20:53,571
What I'm proposing
is revolutionary.

283
00:20:53,604 --> 00:20:55,774
Stop the bickering. Stop it.

284
00:20:58,844 --> 00:21:01,981
I want to see the creature
as soon as possible.

285
00:21:02,013 --> 00:21:03,480
Yes, Majesty.

286
00:21:10,021 --> 00:21:12,224
If this is real, we need it.

287
00:21:12,257 --> 00:21:14,960
Which means we need him.

288
00:21:14,994 --> 00:21:18,097
Why are you so anxious
to make him your enemy?

289
00:21:18,129 --> 00:21:19,798
Self-respect, perhaps?

290
00:21:19,832 --> 00:21:23,601
My immortality secures
the future of France.

291
00:21:23,634 --> 00:21:26,872
The only thing God
gives you as immortal

292
00:21:26,905 --> 00:21:32,111
is your soul and you only
have one of those to lose.

293
00:21:36,281 --> 00:21:38,250
There must be
something you will eat.

294
00:21:39,784 --> 00:21:41,253
Captain.

295
00:21:41,286 --> 00:21:43,587
Bring up the creature.

296
00:21:43,621 --> 00:21:45,858
That's easier said
than done, sire.

297
00:21:45,891 --> 00:21:47,625
She remains on
the bottom, weakened

298
00:21:47,658 --> 00:21:49,660
and traumatized
from her journey.

299
00:21:50,362 --> 00:21:52,765
You speak as if it were human.

300
00:21:52,797 --> 00:21:54,242
I cannot speak
to such things, Father.

301
00:21:54,266 --> 00:21:56,268
I only meant
she behaves like a human.

302
00:21:56,301 --> 00:21:58,203
She's rebellious, she won't eat.

303
00:21:58,236 --> 00:22:00,105
It's as if she's lost
the will to live.

304
00:22:01,072 --> 00:22:02,807
Interesting.

305
00:22:02,841 --> 00:22:05,110
You think it chooses to die?

306
00:22:05,144 --> 00:22:06,311
Nonsense.

307
00:22:06,344 --> 00:22:08,880
The creature's condition
is unacceptable.

308
00:22:08,914 --> 00:22:10,749
It must be brought
to health at once.

309
00:22:10,783 --> 00:22:12,284
Well, you're the doctor.

310
00:22:12,317 --> 00:22:13,786
I'm a sailor.

311
00:22:13,818 --> 00:22:15,586
Perhaps you should remember that

312
00:22:15,619 --> 00:22:17,060
before you speak
with such insolence.

313
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:20,658
Captain Yves,
you understand the creature

314
00:22:20,691 --> 00:22:23,194
is the centerpiece
of the celebration?

315
00:22:23,228 --> 00:22:24,863
- Yes, Sire.
- Good.

316
00:22:24,896 --> 00:22:27,299
Then see to its full
and robust recovery

317
00:22:27,332 --> 00:22:29,068
in time for the eclipse.

318
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,938
And in return you shall
receive a Royal pardon.

319
00:22:33,371 --> 00:22:34,339
Majesty.

320
00:22:34,372 --> 00:22:36,308
However,

321
00:22:36,341 --> 00:22:38,777
you fail me...

322
00:22:38,811 --> 00:22:41,980
then a dark cell
will seem like a paradise.

323
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,982
I promise.

324
00:22:52,191 --> 00:22:53,192
Urgh!

325
00:24:46,471 --> 00:24:48,139
What are you doing?

326
00:24:48,173 --> 00:24:49,974
- No one is allowed in here.
- What is that...

327
00:24:50,008 --> 00:24:51,910
I ask the questions, not you.

328
00:24:51,943 --> 00:24:54,212
- Now answer me.
- It called me here.

329
00:24:55,113 --> 00:24:56,514
Who called you?

330
00:24:56,548 --> 00:24:58,983
The creature, in the water.

331
00:24:59,017 --> 00:25:01,152
- She called you?
- Yes.

332
00:25:01,186 --> 00:25:03,121
With her music.

333
00:25:03,154 --> 00:25:04,789
Can't you hear it?

334
00:25:04,823 --> 00:25:06,791
I hear noise like a...

335
00:25:06,825 --> 00:25:09,094
dolphin or a whale,
but certainly not music.

336
00:25:15,967 --> 00:25:19,304
I want to use
her song in my music.

337
00:25:19,337 --> 00:25:23,241
So that the King, and the whole
world can hear in it what I do.

338
00:25:23,274 --> 00:25:24,943
I'm not sure

339
00:25:24,976 --> 00:25:27,245
which one of you
is the more peculiar.

340
00:25:54,905 --> 00:25:56,374
Please don't go.

341
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:08,353
She has green
eyes. Hair almost like us.

342
00:26:08,386 --> 00:26:11,022
And she called me
from my chamber.

343
00:26:11,055 --> 00:26:14,025
A beautiful hairy fish called
you from your chamber.

344
00:26:14,058 --> 00:26:16,561
No! No, not a fish.

345
00:26:16,594 --> 00:26:19,898
I think she is a mermaid
like in the books.

346
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:21,566
Her music inspired this.

347
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:24,302
Don't fret, monsieurs.

348
00:26:24,335 --> 00:26:27,405
A woman's soul
is as musical as a man's.

349
00:26:28,439 --> 00:26:29,874
With perhaps...

350
00:26:29,908 --> 00:26:32,576
touch more... vibrato.

351
00:26:44,355 --> 00:26:47,025
Sire, it is the hour.

352
00:26:53,964 --> 00:26:55,400
A touch of melancholy.

353
00:27:03,308 --> 00:27:05,944
Like nothing
I've ever heard before.

354
00:27:05,976 --> 00:27:08,913
It seems both of this
world and another.

355
00:27:08,947 --> 00:27:11,982
Invite our young
composer to the ball.

356
00:27:17,288 --> 00:27:20,024
Forgive me, father,
for I have sinned...

357
00:27:26,464 --> 00:27:27,464
Yes?

358
00:27:28,666 --> 00:27:31,035
I can't remember the exact

359
00:27:31,069 --> 00:27:33,338
details of what happened
last night.

360
00:27:36,241 --> 00:27:38,909
I understand. You're forgiven.

361
00:27:43,448 --> 00:27:45,550
I've become used
to pretend to put on make up

362
00:27:45,583 --> 00:27:47,252
for an imaginary grand ball.

363
00:27:47,284 --> 00:27:50,388
Mademoiselle, you spoil things.

364
00:27:50,421 --> 00:27:51,489
Don't speak.

365
00:27:52,725 --> 00:27:55,393
Now...

366
00:27:56,527 --> 00:27:58,229
prepare to dazzle.

367
00:28:04,737 --> 00:28:06,204
Magali!

368
00:28:06,237 --> 00:28:08,406
- What's wrong?
- Well.

369
00:28:08,439 --> 00:28:10,074
I look like a clown!

370
00:28:10,108 --> 00:28:13,511
Nonsense. That's how
all the ladies will be painted.

371
00:28:13,544 --> 00:28:16,114
Well then maybe
I'd rather look like a man.

372
00:28:16,147 --> 00:28:18,349
That's also
how the men will look.

373
00:28:54,485 --> 00:28:56,120
Majesty...

374
00:28:56,154 --> 00:28:58,056
may I present a somewhat

375
00:28:58,088 --> 00:29:00,491
different version
of Mademoiselle d'Alembert.

376
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,163
I like this unique
look of yours.

377
00:29:06,064 --> 00:29:07,398
Perhaps others will follow.

378
00:29:07,432 --> 00:29:09,033
Oh, I doubt it.

379
00:29:09,067 --> 00:29:11,402
You are something
they can never be.

380
00:29:11,436 --> 00:29:13,471
An individual.

381
00:29:13,504 --> 00:29:16,140
In all things, I suspect...

382
00:29:17,641 --> 00:29:19,778
including your music.

383
00:29:19,812 --> 00:29:21,746
I need your help.

384
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,348
Excuse me, Mademoiselle.

385
00:29:25,649 --> 00:29:30,054
I need a brilliant suite for
the Celebration of the Eclipse.

386
00:29:30,088 --> 00:29:33,191
Something regal,
something spiritual.

387
00:29:33,224 --> 00:29:35,760
Something befitting Apollo.

388
00:29:35,794 --> 00:29:37,628
And the Sun King.

389
00:29:37,661 --> 00:29:40,498
Ah, Monsieur Lintillac.

390
00:29:40,531 --> 00:29:43,802
Perhaps you can offer to dance
with this young mademoiselle.

391
00:29:43,836 --> 00:29:45,236
I would be honored.

392
00:29:45,269 --> 00:29:47,438
The two newest
members of the court,

393
00:29:47,472 --> 00:29:52,042
one a dashing son of
France's wealthiest merchant...

394
00:29:52,076 --> 00:29:53,378
And an orphan,

395
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:56,146
recently freed from
a convent defined by

396
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,648
humility and chastity.

397
00:29:57,681 --> 00:30:00,385
Then I must humbly ask whether
such a virtuous young lady

398
00:30:00,417 --> 00:30:02,220
would even know how to dance.

399
00:30:04,555 --> 00:30:06,590
I'm afraid, Majesty,

400
00:30:06,624 --> 00:30:07,836
I wouldn't know where to begin.

401
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,660
Well then, mademoiselle,

402
00:30:09,693 --> 00:30:11,595
allow me to take the lead.

403
00:30:12,563 --> 00:30:14,098
A minuet.

404
00:30:14,132 --> 00:30:15,432
Three-quarter time.

405
00:30:16,567 --> 00:30:17,567
And...

406
00:30:24,441 --> 00:30:26,043
down, up...

407
00:30:26,811 --> 00:30:28,379
up, down.

408
00:30:30,481 --> 00:30:31,784
Now kick.

409
00:30:31,816 --> 00:30:33,384
That's it, beautiful.

410
00:30:33,418 --> 00:30:36,587
Away... yes, to lead and spin.

411
00:30:37,621 --> 00:30:40,158
Beautiful. And kick.

412
00:30:42,126 --> 00:30:43,460
And kick.

413
00:30:48,166 --> 00:30:51,068
And up and turn...

414
00:30:51,602 --> 00:30:53,738
Good. And hold.

415
00:30:53,772 --> 00:30:56,174
That's it. Back.

416
00:30:56,206 --> 00:30:59,310
And down... down.

417
00:30:59,343 --> 00:31:00,343
Away...

418
00:31:01,712 --> 00:31:03,080
to lead.

419
00:31:04,481 --> 00:31:06,417
And ready.

420
00:31:06,451 --> 00:31:08,085
Up, turn...

421
00:31:13,524 --> 00:31:14,524
That's it.

422
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,838
I am so sorry.

423
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:27,705
You did fine, my dear.

424
00:31:29,373 --> 00:31:31,108
She's very beautiful.

425
00:31:32,276 --> 00:31:34,445
What she is, is an opportunity.

426
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:38,750
Just one I don't
fully understand yet.

427
00:31:40,584 --> 00:31:43,320
Everyone,
come and enjoy the fireworks.

428
00:32:01,806 --> 00:32:03,474
It was so amazing.

429
00:32:03,508 --> 00:32:06,377
The King is the most
graceful dancer.

430
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:08,813
You would have loved
the fireworks.

431
00:32:08,847 --> 00:32:10,614
It was so spectacular.

432
00:32:17,756 --> 00:32:21,191
Something about you scares her.

433
00:32:21,225 --> 00:32:24,161
Perhaps it's because
you're feeding her dead fish.

434
00:32:24,929 --> 00:32:26,296
She told you that?

435
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:28,432
Of course. Who else?

436
00:32:31,936 --> 00:32:33,470
Who else indeed?

437
00:32:34,939 --> 00:32:36,875
This place is so beautiful.

438
00:32:36,908 --> 00:32:38,709
I love the water.

439
00:32:39,944 --> 00:32:41,746
You don't seem to be
afraid of it.

440
00:32:43,447 --> 00:32:45,416
You don't seem to be
afraid of anything.

441
00:32:45,449 --> 00:32:47,384
Definitely not water.

442
00:32:47,418 --> 00:32:49,286
I grew up by the sea.

443
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:50,531
It was the only place I could go

444
00:32:50,555 --> 00:32:52,557
to escape the prison
of my convent.

445
00:32:52,589 --> 00:32:55,526
I feel the same way
about Versailles.

446
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,394
Out there, beyond that gate,

447
00:32:57,428 --> 00:32:59,564
is the sailor's favorite sight.

448
00:32:59,596 --> 00:33:02,567
The shore line disappearing
in the distance.

449
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:06,704
Not knowing what's coming next
other than grand adventure.

450
00:33:06,738 --> 00:33:08,205
Sounds wonderful.

451
00:33:11,009 --> 00:33:12,543
Have you ever been to sea?

452
00:33:12,575 --> 00:33:14,378
Only in my dreams.

453
00:33:14,411 --> 00:33:17,281
The Abbess considered
even swimming a crime.

454
00:33:17,314 --> 00:33:20,484
A crime? Against who?

455
00:33:20,517 --> 00:33:22,286
Against God.

456
00:33:24,756 --> 00:33:27,458
The life force
has been confirmed.

457
00:33:28,026 --> 00:33:29,828
As I predicted,

458
00:33:29,861 --> 00:33:31,562
it emanates from the heart.

459
00:33:34,032 --> 00:33:35,699
Once the water has been drained,

460
00:33:35,734 --> 00:33:38,669
the creature will be killed
and the organelle removed...

461
00:33:39,771 --> 00:33:42,506
placing the life force
into our hands.

462
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,481
It's a lovely dress.

463
00:33:50,514 --> 00:33:52,784
Interesting. With your eyes.

464
00:33:55,854 --> 00:33:58,022
Never seen anything like it.

465
00:33:58,056 --> 00:34:00,792
It's wonderful to be here
with someone again.

466
00:34:02,392 --> 00:34:04,661
A completely different
experience.

467
00:34:05,997 --> 00:34:09,700
I understand you have company
here from time to time.

468
00:34:10,935 --> 00:34:12,703
A rumor.

469
00:34:12,737 --> 00:34:17,474
Odd... in a court
so devoid of gossip.

470
00:34:17,508 --> 00:34:18,877
Doesn't make it false.

471
00:34:21,411 --> 00:34:25,516
The statue in the fountain
where you fell in.

472
00:34:25,549 --> 00:34:28,651
That was the last woman who
was here with me in the garden.

473
00:34:28,685 --> 00:34:31,355
- Who is she?
- I used to draw her.

474
00:34:32,056 --> 00:34:33,690
I'm not very good.

475
00:34:34,793 --> 00:34:37,594
Her name was
Louise de la Valliere.

476
00:34:38,763 --> 00:34:40,631
Do I remind you of her?

477
00:34:40,663 --> 00:34:42,665
No one reminds me of her...

478
00:34:43,868 --> 00:34:45,301
until you.

479
00:34:47,471 --> 00:34:51,075
I'm afraid
I've abused my authority.

480
00:34:51,109 --> 00:34:53,944
I questioned some of the nuns
at your convent.

481
00:34:53,978 --> 00:34:55,546
The ones you liked.

482
00:34:55,578 --> 00:34:57,782
Not that there's
such a thing as privacy.

483
00:34:57,816 --> 00:34:59,682
Oh, I shouldn't think so.

484
00:34:59,716 --> 00:35:01,618
They tell me
that you like to ride.

485
00:35:01,652 --> 00:35:04,655
And you are fascinated
by spiders, which is strange

486
00:35:04,687 --> 00:35:07,091
because they terrified
you as a young girl

487
00:35:07,125 --> 00:35:08,827
after one bit you on the leg.

488
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,995
You can't possibly know that.

489
00:35:11,029 --> 00:35:13,664
I'm a king, you know.

490
00:35:13,696 --> 00:35:17,600
And kings have a way of
knowing absolutely everything.

491
00:35:27,644 --> 00:35:31,582
You have made
a pledge of two million livre.

492
00:35:31,614 --> 00:35:34,719
It's a hefty sum, sir,
even for a duchy.

493
00:35:34,752 --> 00:35:37,755
No cost is too great
to honor my father's life.

494
00:35:37,789 --> 00:35:40,124
I see no reason
to place the duchy

495
00:35:40,158 --> 00:35:42,126
into the ground
with your father.

496
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,596
The title Duc de Lintillac...

497
00:35:45,628 --> 00:35:47,630
shall remain alive...

498
00:35:48,967 --> 00:35:50,400
as yours.

499
00:35:51,634 --> 00:35:55,505
I am touched beyond words,
Majesty.

500
00:36:07,918 --> 00:36:10,520
You didn't tell me
the fish men were so...

501
00:36:11,222 --> 00:36:12,857
so...

502
00:36:12,891 --> 00:36:15,391
- Handsome?
- Exactly.

503
00:36:18,695 --> 00:36:21,598
The creature seems to have
recovered, Your Majesty.

504
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:23,868
It will be in perfect health
for the ceremony.

505
00:36:32,943 --> 00:36:34,879
Good servants of France...

506
00:36:34,913 --> 00:36:39,516
in the memory of the export
baron, Pierre Lintillac,

507
00:36:39,549 --> 00:36:43,121
who has found safe passage
to the kingdom of heaven,

508
00:36:43,154 --> 00:36:49,059
I present to you his son,
the future Duc de Lintillac...

509
00:36:49,093 --> 00:36:52,462
whose title shall
be bestowed by me

510
00:36:52,496 --> 00:36:56,801
in my supreme celebration
of the solar eclipse.

511
00:36:57,936 --> 00:36:59,569
For all France!

512
00:36:59,602 --> 00:37:01,704
For all France!

513
00:37:03,741 --> 00:37:06,911
One barracuda is
gruesome enough,

514
00:37:06,945 --> 00:37:09,646
ten will curdle your toes.

515
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,550
We hit a pod of 300 big ones.

516
00:37:13,583 --> 00:37:17,188
Meaner than a slamboon of
drunken musketeers.

517
00:37:18,689 --> 00:37:20,925
They were ramming the hull...
Bang!

518
00:37:20,959 --> 00:37:22,961
Forcing us onto the rocks,

519
00:37:22,993 --> 00:37:26,629
and just as they were about
to tear through the planks...

520
00:37:26,663 --> 00:37:27,898
Oh, how frightening.

521
00:37:27,932 --> 00:37:29,642
Now you'll be telling us
you tore them apart

522
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:31,568
with your bare teeth.

523
00:37:31,601 --> 00:37:33,838
We turned sail and beat
them with the wind.

524
00:37:34,939 --> 00:37:36,740
The easy way out.

525
00:37:36,774 --> 00:37:38,843
Well, I think
it's the clever way out.

526
00:37:40,044 --> 00:37:41,545
A man who fails to kill his prey

527
00:37:41,578 --> 00:37:43,513
is either a weakling
or a coward.

528
00:37:43,547 --> 00:37:46,016
And a man who sees only
two choices is a fool.

529
00:37:47,584 --> 00:37:48,696
You are a worthless commoner.

530
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,587
And you merely behave like one.

531
00:37:51,755 --> 00:37:53,123
That's enough.

532
00:37:54,892 --> 00:37:55,893
Calm.

533
00:37:58,096 --> 00:37:59,596
Your Majesty.

534
00:37:59,629 --> 00:38:02,599
Forgive me, Majesty.
It was all my fault.

535
00:38:02,632 --> 00:38:05,035
Serve the sixth course. Play on.

536
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:27,250
Marie-Josephe!

537
00:39:34,391 --> 00:39:37,095
You should not be
swimming in there.

538
00:39:37,127 --> 00:39:39,330
Her tail is sharp enough
to cut through stone.

539
00:39:39,363 --> 00:39:41,131
Luckily, I'm not made of stone.

540
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,141
No, I suppose you're not.

541
00:40:02,252 --> 00:40:04,021
Why do you hate him so much?

542
00:40:05,189 --> 00:40:07,324
I used to sail lace
to China for his father.

543
00:40:07,358 --> 00:40:10,693
On our last voyage, the Chinese
refused to pay for half,

544
00:40:10,728 --> 00:40:12,229
so, our soon-to-be Duc

545
00:40:12,262 --> 00:40:15,133
accused me of stealing it
and had me arrested.

546
00:40:15,165 --> 00:40:16,666
Shame, isn't it,

547
00:40:16,699 --> 00:40:18,068
when lies obscure the truth.

548
00:40:18,102 --> 00:40:20,270
It seems to be the way things
work around here.

549
00:40:20,304 --> 00:40:22,140
Not with you.

550
00:40:22,172 --> 00:40:24,142
You say what you think.

551
00:40:24,174 --> 00:40:25,776
As do you.

552
00:40:25,809 --> 00:40:28,178
Yes. And it gets me in trouble.

553
00:40:47,197 --> 00:40:48,866
So, you can ride.

554
00:40:48,899 --> 00:40:50,901
Perhaps better than you.

555
00:41:28,472 --> 00:41:30,240
The arm is badly broken.

556
00:41:31,842 --> 00:41:33,219
I'm afraid we're going
to have to amputate.

557
00:41:33,243 --> 00:41:34,945
No.

558
00:41:34,978 --> 00:41:37,147
The bone will not heal
itself, mademoiselle.

559
00:41:37,181 --> 00:41:40,117
This is the prescribed
procedure.

560
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:42,352
Father, please,

561
00:41:42,386 --> 00:41:44,288
don't let him take my arm.

562
00:41:45,389 --> 00:41:47,925
God will protect me.

563
00:41:47,958 --> 00:41:49,827
Put her arm
back in a sling, doctor,

564
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,237
and review her condition
in the morning.

565
00:41:51,261 --> 00:41:53,130
You are out of your element
here, father.

566
00:41:53,163 --> 00:41:57,167
If we don't act, infection will
result in the loss of life.

567
00:41:57,201 --> 00:41:58,735
Act how?

568
00:42:00,404 --> 00:42:01,805
Majesty.

569
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:04,007
He wants to take my arm.

570
00:42:04,041 --> 00:42:06,477
Surely, we can review
this situation in the morning

571
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:08,112
before taking
such drastic action.

572
00:42:08,145 --> 00:42:10,147
- I'm not sure...
- Hold your silence.

573
00:42:19,256 --> 00:42:20,256
May I?

574
00:42:27,164 --> 00:42:31,502
Life is filled
with suffering, my child.

575
00:42:31,535 --> 00:42:34,238
And you have suffered
with such grace.

576
00:42:35,205 --> 00:42:36,340
Just rest.

577
00:42:38,908 --> 00:42:40,210
Take care then.

578
00:42:51,555 --> 00:42:53,190
God is with her.

579
00:42:54,091 --> 00:42:56,126
Even better than science.

580
00:43:39,236 --> 00:43:40,370
Monsieur Yves.

581
00:43:44,341 --> 00:43:45,409
She's not well.

582
00:43:47,444 --> 00:43:49,346
The mermaid.

583
00:43:49,379 --> 00:43:51,348
She wants to help.

584
00:43:51,381 --> 00:43:52,449
She told you?

585
00:43:53,283 --> 00:43:54,384
Who else?

586
00:43:55,618 --> 00:43:58,088
The fish also speaks to you?

587
00:43:58,121 --> 00:44:01,124
Well, a manner of
speaking... yes.

588
00:44:06,629 --> 00:44:09,066
If anything happens...

589
00:44:09,099 --> 00:44:11,000
I'll never forgive myself.

590
00:44:11,668 --> 00:44:13,470
Imagine how I would feel.

591
00:45:22,705 --> 00:45:25,475
Could she possibly
have healed so quickly?

592
00:45:27,076 --> 00:45:29,212
Apparently, she is
capable of anything.

593
00:45:31,114 --> 00:45:34,250
She produced a golden light,
Majesty.

594
00:45:34,284 --> 00:45:36,186
And I could breathe underwater.

595
00:45:36,219 --> 00:45:39,456
Incontrovertible proof, Majesty.

596
00:45:39,489 --> 00:45:41,291
Proof?

597
00:45:41,325 --> 00:45:43,293
I assume, mademoiselle,
you have heard

598
00:45:43,327 --> 00:45:46,229
of the extraordinary
powers of the creature?

599
00:45:46,262 --> 00:45:48,165
I grant that something
has occurred here

600
00:45:48,198 --> 00:45:51,034
but what is not yet clear.
You are speaking of fables.

601
00:45:51,068 --> 00:45:53,603
Everything's a fable
until proven true.

602
00:45:53,636 --> 00:45:56,073
And now the creature
has chosen you

603
00:45:56,105 --> 00:45:58,709
as the first to experience
her healing powers.

604
00:45:58,742 --> 00:46:01,244
Don't call her a creature.

605
00:46:01,277 --> 00:46:04,047
She has a soul,
just the same as you.

606
00:46:04,081 --> 00:46:06,282
Nonsense. She is a creature.

607
00:46:06,316 --> 00:46:09,419
And her purpose
is to serve the court.

608
00:46:09,453 --> 00:46:12,456
Is that why she's here? Are you
ill and in need of a cure?

609
00:46:12,489 --> 00:46:15,459
- I must be excused...
- Sit, father.

610
00:46:18,628 --> 00:46:21,098
No one's ill, child.

611
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:23,801
Your new friend is here
to herald a brand new day

612
00:46:23,835 --> 00:46:26,002
for old servants of France.

613
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:31,307
You are the most wonderful
and generous monarch.

614
00:46:39,783 --> 00:46:41,385
By using the mermaid's power

615
00:46:41,417 --> 00:46:45,088
to heal the common
people of France...

616
00:46:45,122 --> 00:46:47,557
you have earned your
place in eternity.

617
00:46:49,158 --> 00:46:53,230
Well
as long as it's earned.

618
00:46:53,263 --> 00:46:57,300
And once she has completed
this wonderful task...

619
00:46:57,333 --> 00:46:59,136
will you then set her free?

620
00:47:01,773 --> 00:47:05,375
Her life shall be
what God intends.

621
00:47:05,409 --> 00:47:08,244
The mermaid was brought here
for the king, not for France,

622
00:47:08,278 --> 00:47:10,814
just as I was
and just as you were.

623
00:47:10,848 --> 00:47:13,383
I have more faith in him
than you do.

624
00:47:13,417 --> 00:47:15,819
Perhaps. But you are too naive.

625
00:47:15,853 --> 00:47:17,521
And you are too cynical.

626
00:47:19,122 --> 00:47:21,457
With all due respect,
mademoiselle,

627
00:47:21,491 --> 00:47:23,168
what do you know of the world
that you've not seen

628
00:47:23,192 --> 00:47:25,194
from the window of a convent?

629
00:47:25,863 --> 00:47:28,165
Please do not assume that...

630
00:47:28,197 --> 00:47:30,133
because I haven't lived
as broadly as you

631
00:47:30,167 --> 00:47:32,436
that I have not lived as deeply.

632
00:47:32,468 --> 00:47:35,572
Besides, one day
I will see the world.

633
00:47:37,307 --> 00:47:38,675
I believe you will.

634
00:47:39,743 --> 00:47:41,311
I meant no offense.

635
00:47:54,357 --> 00:47:55,435
I thought you were
going to show me

636
00:47:55,459 --> 00:47:57,527
a different side of Versailles.

637
00:47:57,561 --> 00:47:59,362
I am. Look.

638
00:48:03,366 --> 00:48:04,844
What are people saying
about the mystery

639
00:48:04,868 --> 00:48:07,303
of the king's common girl?

640
00:48:07,337 --> 00:48:09,572
Well, common girl, maybe.

641
00:48:11,208 --> 00:48:13,309
Rumor has it,
she has ties to the king.

642
00:48:14,243 --> 00:48:16,213
What kind of ties?

643
00:48:16,245 --> 00:48:18,181
That's still a mystery.

644
00:48:22,652 --> 00:48:24,221
Hey!

645
00:48:24,253 --> 00:48:25,655
Mademoiselle.

646
00:48:35,665 --> 00:48:38,468
That's the fisherman's house,
where Benoit and I live.

647
00:48:38,502 --> 00:48:40,536
It's so sweet.

648
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:42,538
Sweet?

649
00:48:42,572 --> 00:48:45,776
Sweet is not a word used
for fishermen.

650
00:48:45,809 --> 00:48:48,812
Dashing, courageous, fearless.

651
00:48:48,846 --> 00:48:50,346
Not sweet.

652
00:48:54,684 --> 00:48:55,919
You have a lighthouse.

653
00:48:55,953 --> 00:48:58,722
Afraid so.
It's only a few more steps.

654
00:49:04,962 --> 00:49:06,764
The sky is so beautiful.

655
00:49:09,699 --> 00:49:12,669
Yes, but... but out there,
beyond the horizon

656
00:49:12,702 --> 00:49:15,505
where the river meets the sea,
that's where...

657
00:49:15,539 --> 00:49:18,708
Every sailor gets his last
look at France.

658
00:49:23,781 --> 00:49:27,383
I can see you now,
at the helm of your ship,

659
00:49:27,417 --> 00:49:29,585
sailing into the sunset.

660
00:49:31,421 --> 00:49:33,757
That's my dream.

661
00:49:33,791 --> 00:49:35,591
To sail away from all this.

662
00:49:38,762 --> 00:49:40,229
And what's your dream?

663
00:49:42,498 --> 00:49:45,435
I want the mermaid to return
to her home.

664
00:49:45,468 --> 00:49:46,970
She is certainly not of
this world.

665
00:49:47,004 --> 00:49:49,338
Nor am I.

666
00:49:49,372 --> 00:49:51,207
I want to go with her.

667
00:49:51,809 --> 00:49:53,309
To go with her?

668
00:49:55,611 --> 00:49:56,980
Not really, but

669
00:49:57,014 --> 00:49:58,949
I could swim in her light

670
00:49:58,982 --> 00:50:01,284
and I'd outrun the fastest ship.

671
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:06,489
One day, I will have you
on the bow of my ship.

672
00:50:07,725 --> 00:50:10,761
We'll race the mermaid
and see who's fastest.

673
00:50:21,603 --> 00:50:24,507
Come.
There's... there's more to see.

674
00:50:35,485 --> 00:50:37,887
- This is amazing. What is it?
- Hmm.

675
00:50:37,921 --> 00:50:40,323
It's called
the Temple of Love...

676
00:50:42,092 --> 00:50:44,527
built in honor of
a woman unnamed.

677
00:50:47,865 --> 00:50:48,898
The rumor is that...

678
00:51:01,879 --> 00:51:03,781
Thank you
for receiving me, Majesty.

679
00:51:03,814 --> 00:51:07,717
There is something I must ask
for humbly, respectfully...

680
00:51:07,751 --> 00:51:11,921
But first, permit me to ask
something of you.

681
00:51:11,955 --> 00:51:13,923
Something for France.

682
00:51:13,957 --> 00:51:16,559
Anything, Majesty.
Even my life.

683
00:51:16,592 --> 00:51:20,696
Oh! It's something
a little less drastic.

684
00:51:20,731 --> 00:51:24,534
I want you to accept the hand
of my daughter,

685
00:51:24,567 --> 00:51:27,403
Marie-Josephe in marriage.

686
00:51:29,973 --> 00:51:32,075
I'm overwhelmed.

687
00:51:32,109 --> 00:51:34,778
This would be an honor.

688
00:51:35,779 --> 00:51:36,880
Good.

689
00:51:37,613 --> 00:51:38,680
Well...

690
00:51:38,714 --> 00:51:41,084
since you obviously weren't
listening at the door

691
00:51:41,118 --> 00:51:42,920
you must be completely
in the dark.

692
00:51:42,952 --> 00:51:44,453
Utterly.

693
00:51:46,723 --> 00:51:50,560
- What do you think?
- Does she love Lintillac?

694
00:51:50,592 --> 00:51:53,529
Does it actually matter to you?

695
00:51:55,098 --> 00:51:57,400
Am I so...

696
00:51:57,433 --> 00:52:00,403
endlessly and infinitely
self-centered?

697
00:52:00,436 --> 00:52:02,105
It's worse.

698
00:52:02,139 --> 00:52:05,441
Your power is so complete,

699
00:52:05,474 --> 00:52:08,812
you're never allowed to care
about anyone.

700
00:52:10,513 --> 00:52:12,481
And it's rather terrible.

701
00:52:15,585 --> 00:52:18,487
- What are you doing here?
- She called me.

702
00:53:15,544 --> 00:53:17,046
I never knew I could feel
like this.

703
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:21,752
Oh, mademoiselle, stars in
your eyes become you.

704
00:53:21,785 --> 00:53:24,453
Father, something amazing
has happened.

705
00:53:24,487 --> 00:53:27,758
- I was just coming to tell you.
- Later, little one.

706
00:53:27,791 --> 00:53:29,826
The king has asked to see you.

707
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:33,897
You will step forward slowly...

708
00:53:34,964 --> 00:53:36,565
and quietly.

709
00:53:42,238 --> 00:53:45,707
Do you recall our conversation
in the garden?

710
00:53:45,742 --> 00:53:47,677
About the woman of the fountain?

711
00:53:47,709 --> 00:53:49,913
Yes, of course.
The only woman...

712
00:53:51,713 --> 00:53:53,784
You remind me so much of her.

713
00:53:54,751 --> 00:53:57,653
At times I think you are her.

714
00:53:59,088 --> 00:54:01,524
You are...

715
00:54:01,557 --> 00:54:03,794
the very spirit of your mother.

716
00:54:06,595 --> 00:54:07,595
My mother?

717
00:54:09,565 --> 00:54:12,601
She had a mind
and spirit all her own.

718
00:54:14,137 --> 00:54:16,440
She was an individual.

719
00:54:19,242 --> 00:54:21,677
She was not made
for court life...

720
00:54:23,246 --> 00:54:25,014
any more than you are.

721
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:34,057
She left for the convent before
I knew she was with child.

722
00:54:37,659 --> 00:54:40,495
She died, giving birth.

723
00:54:47,303 --> 00:54:50,073
- You're my father.
- Yes.

724
00:54:54,177 --> 00:54:56,880
Marie, I am a terrible man.

725
00:54:56,913 --> 00:55:00,017
A very selfish man.

726
00:55:00,049 --> 00:55:04,755
I've cared more for France
than about you or even her.

727
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:08,791
Why are you telling me this?

728
00:55:08,825 --> 00:55:12,561
Because there are sacrifices
you must make...

729
00:55:12,594 --> 00:55:14,063
for France.

730
00:55:14,931 --> 00:55:16,165
Sacrifices?

731
00:55:16,199 --> 00:55:19,036
Our country's treasury is empty.

732
00:55:19,068 --> 00:55:21,038
Enemies surround us.

733
00:55:21,070 --> 00:55:23,172
Lies, treachery.

734
00:55:23,206 --> 00:55:25,607
We need money, child.

735
00:55:25,641 --> 00:55:28,177
The young Duke Lintillac...

736
00:55:28,211 --> 00:55:30,914
his money...
when you marry him...

737
00:55:30,947 --> 00:55:32,248
No. No.

738
00:55:32,282 --> 00:55:34,751
I won't marry that man.
I won't.

739
00:55:34,785 --> 00:55:37,120
You don't have to agree, child.

740
00:55:40,256 --> 00:55:42,624
You have to obey.

741
00:55:49,999 --> 00:55:51,566
Of course.

742
00:55:52,969 --> 00:55:54,203
Majesty.

743
00:56:06,382 --> 00:56:08,151
For all France.

744
00:56:46,055 --> 00:56:50,360
I prayed every night
as a little girl

745
00:56:50,393 --> 00:56:53,229
for a mother and father...

746
00:56:53,262 --> 00:56:56,833
and now I wish my prayers
had never been answered.

747
00:56:58,167 --> 00:57:01,437
You must stop hoping
for a perfect world...

748
00:57:02,872 --> 00:57:05,241
when we live in this one.

749
00:58:21,951 --> 00:58:24,720
You understand things,
don't you?

750
00:58:31,794 --> 00:58:33,930
I have experienced something,

751
00:58:33,963 --> 00:58:37,200
that mermaid has touched
the very fabric of my being.

752
00:58:39,068 --> 00:58:41,370
Only God can grant us
immortality

753
00:58:41,404 --> 00:58:45,842
unless you believe that He's
bestowed that power on you.

754
00:58:45,875 --> 00:58:48,244
I believe He's bestowed on me

755
00:58:48,277 --> 00:58:49,779
the power to discover.

756
00:58:49,812 --> 00:58:51,814
I'm speaking of the soul.

757
00:58:51,848 --> 00:58:53,850
I love the king.

758
00:58:53,883 --> 00:58:56,819
By murdering an intelligent
being in his name,

759
00:58:56,853 --> 00:58:59,889
you are committing him
to eternal damnation!

760
00:59:03,025 --> 00:59:05,328
Go back to your monastery,
priest.

761
00:59:07,430 --> 00:59:09,999
Worry about your own soul...

762
00:59:10,032 --> 00:59:11,534
and stay out of my way.

763
01:00:00,216 --> 01:00:02,218
I am no more afraid
than you are.

764
01:00:45,461 --> 01:00:47,296
Heave!

765
01:00:57,406 --> 01:00:59,075
No!

766
01:01:15,726 --> 01:01:18,094
Everything is in order, Majesty.

767
01:01:18,127 --> 01:01:20,529
The creature is in peak
condition for the procedure.

768
01:01:20,563 --> 01:01:22,664
- Good. Talk me through.
- Yes.

769
01:01:22,698 --> 01:01:24,400
Majesty.

770
01:01:25,601 --> 01:01:28,404
I can no longer keep silent.

771
01:01:28,437 --> 01:01:30,339
How unlike you.

772
01:01:30,373 --> 01:01:32,508
Sit, father.

773
01:01:35,511 --> 01:01:36,678
I know your feelings.

774
01:01:36,712 --> 01:01:39,115
You are contemplating,

775
01:01:39,148 --> 01:01:41,350
the greatest mortal sin.

776
01:01:41,384 --> 01:01:44,253
This is not about sin,
it's about science.

777
01:01:44,287 --> 01:01:48,257
Science is not
absolute, Majesty.

778
01:01:48,291 --> 01:01:51,193
He who searches
the hearts of men

779
01:01:51,227 --> 01:01:53,695
will know the mind
of the spirit.

780
01:01:53,730 --> 01:01:56,032
Thank you for the nice line
of scripture,

781
01:01:56,064 --> 01:01:58,000
but unless you've talked to God,

782
01:01:58,034 --> 01:01:59,736
I don't believe you know
His will.

783
01:01:59,770 --> 01:02:02,038
Perhaps not, but I do know that

784
01:02:02,070 --> 01:02:04,540
immortality is the province
of God alone.

785
01:02:04,573 --> 01:02:08,511
Then who placed the mermaid
in the sea for us to capture?

786
01:02:08,544 --> 01:02:13,081
Who called upon me to carry out
His vision of a supreme France?

787
01:02:13,115 --> 01:02:16,618
Do not confuse divine right
and divine guidance.

788
01:02:16,652 --> 01:02:19,955
Then, let Him decide matters.

789
01:02:22,224 --> 01:02:26,028
Command me, Oh Heavenly Father.

790
01:02:27,129 --> 01:02:30,098
Strike me down here and now

791
01:02:30,132 --> 01:02:34,503
if I am about to commit
a mortal sin.

792
01:02:42,779 --> 01:02:44,246
Now, father,

793
01:02:44,279 --> 01:02:46,215
if my communion
with the creature

794
01:02:46,248 --> 01:02:49,185
gives me eternal life,

795
01:02:49,218 --> 01:02:51,087
it will be God's will.

796
01:03:15,478 --> 01:03:16,612
Carry on.

797
01:04:43,766 --> 01:04:45,334
Benoit.

798
01:04:49,371 --> 01:04:51,074
They are going to kill her.

799
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:54,309
I need to warn Marie-Josephe.

800
01:05:05,922 --> 01:05:09,492
Tomorrow a new age
will dawn for all but us.

801
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:19,869
You need to make a diversion.

802
01:05:19,902 --> 01:05:21,336
I do.

803
01:05:21,370 --> 01:05:22,471
I do?

804
01:05:23,605 --> 01:05:25,140
I do.

805
01:05:31,713 --> 01:05:33,516
Sir...

806
01:05:34,716 --> 01:05:36,919
Halt! Come back here.

807
01:05:57,706 --> 01:05:58,841
Doctor, I was hoping...

808
01:05:58,875 --> 01:06:00,910
Save your breath, De La Croix.

809
01:06:05,748 --> 01:06:07,616
You were in enough trouble,

810
01:06:07,649 --> 01:06:10,853
but sneaking around the
room of the King's daughter...

811
01:06:10,887 --> 01:06:12,755
Now, that's a capital offense.

812
01:06:14,991 --> 01:06:16,692
Lock him up for the night.

813
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:20,495
Come on. Keep going.

814
01:06:57,033 --> 01:06:58,801
There will be no music
this morning.

815
01:06:58,835 --> 01:07:00,502
Leave your instruments.

816
01:07:04,006 --> 01:07:05,874
It is the hour, sire.

817
01:07:14,516 --> 01:07:16,318
You cannot kill the mermaid.

818
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:18,353
I won't let you.

819
01:07:18,386 --> 01:07:20,022
You won't let me?

820
01:07:20,056 --> 01:07:22,024
Didn't the Abbess teach
you any manners?

821
01:07:22,058 --> 01:07:23,860
Here is my offer...

822
01:07:23,892 --> 01:07:25,393
You return her to the sea

823
01:07:25,427 --> 01:07:26,829
and I will consent
to this marriage.

824
01:07:26,863 --> 01:07:30,933
You can't haggle with your
King like some shopkeeper.

825
01:07:30,967 --> 01:07:33,301
I can scarcely believe
I was so blind

826
01:07:33,335 --> 01:07:34,771
as to not to see
this moment coming.

827
01:07:34,804 --> 01:07:38,540
You swim with her. You commune
with her. She is your pet.

828
01:07:38,573 --> 01:07:41,376
No!
She is all but human.

829
01:07:41,409 --> 01:07:44,013
She feels her life
just as we feel ours.

830
01:07:44,046 --> 01:07:45,748
Maybe so.

831
01:07:45,782 --> 01:07:49,618
But you are the one who has
proven the doctor right.

832
01:07:50,919 --> 01:07:53,622
You think I want this for
my own immortality?

833
01:07:53,654 --> 01:07:55,924
France needs a leader
who can protect her.

834
01:07:55,958 --> 01:07:58,627
This is ridiculous.
This is murder!

835
01:07:58,659 --> 01:08:00,897
- Silence!
- Silence to you, Father!

836
01:08:13,910 --> 01:08:15,845
Your wedding is today.

837
01:08:17,146 --> 01:08:18,679
Be ready.

838
01:08:23,418 --> 01:08:24,854
Musketeers.

839
01:08:37,532 --> 01:08:39,035
Who's getting married today?

840
01:08:39,068 --> 01:08:41,938
Mademoiselle d'Alembert is
to marry Monsieur Lintillac.

841
01:08:43,872 --> 01:08:45,908
Marie-Josephe...?

842
01:08:57,618 --> 01:09:00,455
Mademoiselle,
you must calm down

843
01:09:00,488 --> 01:09:02,356
and prepare for the wedding.

844
01:09:08,798 --> 01:09:11,133
Magali,
please go call Pere La Chaise

845
01:09:11,167 --> 01:09:12,969
to come hear my confession.

846
01:09:17,807 --> 01:09:21,143
You will do exactly
as you've been ordered.

847
01:09:21,177 --> 01:09:23,578
Or you shall forfeit your life.

848
01:09:25,181 --> 01:09:26,883
Drain the water.

849
01:09:39,128 --> 01:09:43,733
Killing the mermaid will damn
his soul rather than save it.

850
01:09:43,766 --> 01:09:46,002
You're the only one
who can stop him.

851
01:09:46,034 --> 01:09:47,737
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

852
01:09:47,770 --> 01:09:51,039
No, I'm sorry.
I... I've tried.

853
01:09:51,073 --> 01:09:52,909
The King has
ruled for so long,

854
01:09:52,941 --> 01:09:55,177
he believes he has
been given permission

855
01:09:55,210 --> 01:09:56,645
by the Almighty.

856
01:09:56,677 --> 01:09:58,147
Then free me
from this chamber

857
01:09:58,180 --> 01:10:00,750
so I may bid the mermaid
farewell.

858
01:10:00,783 --> 01:10:03,551
The King has
forbidden further contact.

859
01:10:03,584 --> 01:10:05,520
Which is why I'm asking you.

860
01:10:05,553 --> 01:10:07,924
No, I'm begging you, Father.

861
01:10:07,956 --> 01:10:09,690
Please help me.

862
01:10:11,059 --> 01:10:13,195
Forget what's proper,

863
01:10:13,228 --> 01:10:14,830
and do what's right.

864
01:10:22,703 --> 01:10:25,041
My reasons may be
different from yours...

865
01:10:27,676 --> 01:10:30,078
but the mermaid
must escape the King.

866
01:10:37,519 --> 01:10:41,924
No one will believe
you're going to a wedding...

867
01:10:41,958 --> 01:10:44,893
dressed like that.

868
01:10:52,768 --> 01:10:55,871
My dearest Magali...

869
01:10:57,739 --> 01:10:59,809
you have been a true friend.

870
01:11:01,177 --> 01:11:02,845
I will miss you greatly.

871
01:11:03,611 --> 01:11:05,547
I am frightened for you.

872
01:11:07,615 --> 01:11:10,685
Weren't you the one
who taught me

873
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:14,223
that a little trauma
can inspire greatness?

874
01:11:16,591 --> 01:11:18,060
I was just kidding.

875
01:11:30,973 --> 01:11:32,975
I'm taking the girl
to confession.

876
01:11:33,009 --> 01:11:35,878
I have orders to hold her
here until the wedding.

877
01:11:35,911 --> 01:11:38,080
And you dare...

878
01:11:38,114 --> 01:11:41,083
challenge... me?

879
01:12:38,974 --> 01:12:42,144
This is a kiss I always
thought I'd give to my father.

880
01:12:48,884 --> 01:12:51,686
God has graced you with wings.

881
01:12:53,422 --> 01:12:55,656
I only hope you know how to fly.

882
01:13:20,382 --> 01:13:22,683
- Secure the rope.
- Aye.

883
01:13:22,717 --> 01:13:24,120
Hoist the net.

884
01:13:28,390 --> 01:13:30,859
What?
We haven't got all day.

885
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:33,195
Benoit.

886
01:13:41,069 --> 01:13:42,838
You can't possibly
be doing this.

887
01:13:42,871 --> 01:13:44,373
We do what he says.

888
01:13:44,406 --> 01:13:45,874
Whether we end
up in the Bastille

889
01:13:45,907 --> 01:13:48,276
or married for money,
we do as we are told.

890
01:13:48,310 --> 01:13:50,278
I would never
let him sentence me.

891
01:13:50,312 --> 01:13:52,214
Why would you?

892
01:13:52,247 --> 01:13:54,216
I swam
with her last night.

893
01:13:54,249 --> 01:13:57,919
She conveyed to me
that you were her captor.

894
01:13:57,953 --> 01:14:00,922
Did you know you
took her from her child?

895
01:14:00,956 --> 01:14:03,258
- No.
- But you knew of her mate?

896
01:14:03,291 --> 01:14:04,860
Yes. And we set him free.

897
01:14:04,893 --> 01:14:06,428
Then you owe her
the right to return

898
01:14:06,461 --> 01:14:08,397
to whatever family she has left.

899
01:14:08,430 --> 01:14:10,265
And have my
men face the gallows?

900
01:14:10,298 --> 01:14:12,000
I'm not asking them.

901
01:14:13,068 --> 01:14:14,170
I'm asking you.

902
01:14:14,202 --> 01:14:17,239
What makes your desire
to sail the sea more important

903
01:14:17,272 --> 01:14:19,474
than her right to live there?

904
01:14:19,508 --> 01:14:21,410
The King justifies everything?

905
01:14:21,443 --> 01:14:23,011
You mean your father.

906
01:14:23,779 --> 01:14:25,181
I mean the King.

907
01:14:26,815 --> 01:14:29,051
Are you no better than him?

908
01:14:29,084 --> 01:14:30,952
You said,

909
01:14:30,986 --> 01:14:32,954
the King can't sentence me.

910
01:14:34,456 --> 01:14:35,891
Did you mean...

911
01:14:37,059 --> 01:14:40,462
I could never marry a man
I do not love.

912
01:14:46,301 --> 01:14:48,403
Everybody out. Take the men.

913
01:14:48,437 --> 01:14:49,738
Head for the ships and set sail

914
01:14:49,771 --> 01:14:52,140
at once for the cliff of
Le Havre.

915
01:14:52,174 --> 01:14:54,042
What about you two?

916
01:14:54,076 --> 01:14:56,178
Well, God willing,
we will see you there.

917
01:15:01,416 --> 01:15:02,818
Let's go, men.

918
01:15:02,851 --> 01:15:05,320
You heard the Captain.
Let's move.

919
01:15:07,823 --> 01:15:09,724
We are going to need
to cross the bridge.

920
01:15:10,859 --> 01:15:12,828
You'll ruin your dress.

921
01:15:16,264 --> 01:15:17,833
So I will.

922
01:15:19,868 --> 01:15:20,878
You will follow the directions
I gave...

923
01:15:20,902 --> 01:15:24,072
- Doctor?
- Yes?

924
01:15:24,106 --> 01:15:26,741
It's the girl. She's escaped.

925
01:15:37,886 --> 01:15:40,822
Her only chance is to go
through the underground river.

926
01:15:40,856 --> 01:15:42,958
At least it's swimming
to her freedom.

927
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:56,271
The water level is too low for
her to jump the retaining wall.

928
01:15:56,304 --> 01:15:59,141
Can't you drain the water
from the chateau into the pool?

929
01:15:59,174 --> 01:16:00,876
If we drain the canal
and the fountains

930
01:16:00,908 --> 01:16:02,544
all at once,
it might work but...

931
01:16:02,577 --> 01:16:04,012
But what?

932
01:16:04,045 --> 01:16:05,981
The pipes might not hold.

933
01:16:07,415 --> 01:16:08,850
But if they do?

934
01:16:08,884 --> 01:16:10,161
There's a tributary
before Le Havre

935
01:16:10,185 --> 01:16:12,387
which will give her safe
harbor to the sea.

936
01:16:12,420 --> 01:16:14,156
Can you communicate that to her?

937
01:16:15,524 --> 01:16:17,359
She understands everything.

938
01:16:37,979 --> 01:16:39,381
We should get moving.

939
01:16:48,089 --> 01:16:50,192
We need to reverse
the water pressure.

940
01:17:23,425 --> 01:17:25,259
Stop them!

941
01:17:25,293 --> 01:17:28,330
The creature!
It must not escape!

942
01:17:30,264 --> 01:17:31,233
No!

943
01:17:31,265 --> 01:17:33,068
We need it alive.

944
01:17:41,109 --> 01:17:42,877
Yves!

945
01:17:54,689 --> 01:17:56,391
You need to jump the wall.

946
01:18:05,433 --> 01:18:06,635
Labarthe!

947
01:18:21,383 --> 01:18:22,517
Yves!

948
01:18:24,152 --> 01:18:25,287
Yves.

949
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:41,068
You've interfered enough.

950
01:18:48,009 --> 01:18:49,377
Take Yves and go!

951
01:18:51,479 --> 01:18:52,580
Now!

952
01:19:49,237 --> 01:19:52,340
See you there. God willing.

953
01:20:09,557 --> 01:20:12,293
The caverns below the Grotto
of Thetis have collapsed.

954
01:20:12,326 --> 01:20:13,729
And what
of the girl?

955
01:20:13,763 --> 01:20:15,530
She was seen riding off

956
01:20:15,563 --> 01:20:16,664
the grounds, Your Majesty.

957
01:20:45,226 --> 01:20:46,561
This way to Le Havre.

958
01:20:46,594 --> 01:20:49,463
Order out the ships,
so there's no escape.

959
01:21:35,276 --> 01:21:37,612
Mama. A mermaid!

960
01:21:39,881 --> 01:21:42,683
Jean, you ought to have
seen a fish.

961
01:21:42,717 --> 01:21:44,619
Mermaids don't exist.
Come on.

962
01:22:50,986 --> 01:22:52,453
Marie-Josephe.

963
01:22:53,521 --> 01:22:54,522
Stop.

964
01:22:54,556 --> 01:22:56,691
Stay, stay, stay.

965
01:22:56,725 --> 01:22:58,259
I'll jump.

966
01:22:59,861 --> 01:23:01,997
You can't mean that.

967
01:23:02,030 --> 01:23:04,331
You're angry. I understand.

968
01:23:04,365 --> 01:23:05,934
- But life is so precious.
- No.

969
01:23:05,967 --> 01:23:07,769
You think you understand.

970
01:23:08,870 --> 01:23:10,404
You don't.

971
01:23:11,338 --> 01:23:12,707
Then tell me.

972
01:23:15,309 --> 01:23:16,878
The only opportunity

973
01:23:16,912 --> 01:23:19,480
I've ever wanted

974
01:23:19,513 --> 01:23:21,750
was to belong to someone.

975
01:23:23,617 --> 01:23:25,319
I came here...

976
01:23:26,353 --> 01:23:27,756
fell in love.

977
01:23:29,024 --> 01:23:30,826
I met a mermaid

978
01:23:30,858 --> 01:23:32,293
who has become

979
01:23:32,326 --> 01:23:34,295
the greatest friend.

980
01:23:36,464 --> 01:23:38,365
And I found you...

981
01:23:39,366 --> 01:23:40,769
Father.

982
01:23:45,073 --> 01:23:46,908
You don't care about me.

983
01:23:46,942 --> 01:23:48,409
Don't say that.

984
01:23:48,442 --> 01:23:51,012
You don't care about anyone,
but yourself.

985
01:23:54,682 --> 01:23:56,852
Give me the chance
to prove you wrong.

986
01:23:57,953 --> 01:24:00,287
How could that ever be?

987
01:24:21,408 --> 01:24:22,844
Musketeers...

988
01:24:23,812 --> 01:24:25,379
Mark your target.

989
01:24:33,653 --> 01:24:35,456
It's simple.

990
01:24:35,489 --> 01:24:38,492
You take the mermaid,
she gives you life.

991
01:24:39,828 --> 01:24:42,429
You let her live...

992
01:24:42,463 --> 01:24:43,799
she saves mine.

993
01:24:49,104 --> 01:24:50,872
What's your choice?

994
01:24:56,745 --> 01:24:58,311
Come get me.

995
01:24:59,579 --> 01:25:00,849
No!

996
01:25:30,678 --> 01:25:32,880
I have a clean shot, Majesty.

997
01:25:34,816 --> 01:25:36,417
We're running
out of time.

998
01:25:46,761 --> 01:25:47,929
Stand down.

999
01:26:35,877 --> 01:26:37,211
Are you alright?

1000
01:26:37,245 --> 01:26:39,412
Yes. Are you?

1001
01:26:40,214 --> 01:26:41,681
She saved me.

1002
01:26:42,216 --> 01:26:43,517
Us.

1003
01:26:55,562 --> 01:26:58,499
You've
always been a great King.

1004
01:26:58,532 --> 01:27:01,568
Now you've become a great man.

1005
01:27:02,970 --> 01:27:05,206
Signal the ships
to retreat.

1006
01:27:21,621 --> 01:27:23,224
You were right.

1007
01:27:23,257 --> 01:27:24,992
It's something terrible...

1008
01:27:27,594 --> 01:27:29,030
to care for someone.

1009
01:27:35,770 --> 01:27:38,471
Bless me, father,
for I have sinned...

1010
01:27:39,639 --> 01:27:41,209
In the name of the Father,

1011
01:27:41,242 --> 01:27:44,079
and of the son,
and of the Holy Spirit.

1012
01:27:47,082 --> 01:27:48,549
Amen.

1013
01:28:01,096 --> 01:28:02,864
You are forgiven.

1014
01:28:09,603 --> 01:28:12,741
Only love is immortal,
Your Majesty.

1015
01:28:14,708 --> 01:28:17,912
So,
Captain Yves and Marie-Josephe

1016
01:28:17,945 --> 01:28:21,648
started their life together
in search of Atlantis

1017
01:28:21,681 --> 01:28:26,287
and their dear friend,
the magical mermaid.

1018
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:28,990
We're close.
I can feel it.
