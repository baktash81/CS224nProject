1
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:14,879
Tickets.

2
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,426
Tickets, please.

3
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:28,226
Thank you. Tickets.

4
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,270
Is it far to Tucumcari?

5
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,897
We should pass there 
 in about three or four minutes.

6
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,315
Thanks.

7
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:37,736
Excuse me, but you've 
 made a mistake, Reverend.

8
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,280
I couldn't help hearing 
 you're going to Tucumcari.

9
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:43,533
I peddle goods around here, and I better 
 tell you you're on the wrong train.

10
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,623
I think the nearest stop 
 to Tucumcari is Amarillo.

11
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:53,960
By getting off at Sante Fe 
 and returning by way of Amarillo...

12
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:57,797
you should be able to get 
 right where you're going.

13
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:04,346
You see, the train 
 doesn't stop at Tucumcari.

14
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:17,025
This train'll stop at Tucumcari.

15
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,553
Take it easy, everybody!

16
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,931
Why'd you stop? 
 Something gone wrong?

17
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,141
Somebody pulled the emergency cord.

18
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:04,197
Hey, mister, you just can't pull 
 the emergency cord and jump off.

19
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,325
Why'd you stop that train? 
 If you want to get off, you...

20
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:11,871
Well, the railroad company'd be mighty 
 pleased to make any arrangements...

21
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:15,083
for any passenger if you want 
 to get off here, sir.

22
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,836
I did get off. Thanks.

23
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:23,633
All right, let's go! 
 Go ahead!

24
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:01,129
Guy passed by here in person 
 and added on those two zeros.

25
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:04,799
He was spittin' mad when he saw what 
 they was offerin'. He wasn't flattered.

26
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:08,053
He said, A measly thousand bucks 
 for me is much too little.

27
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,972
I'm worth a lot more than that.

28
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:14,059
He said that, and then he added 
 the zeros on the thousand.

29
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:19,439
There isn't anyone got the guts 
 to face that killer, eh?

30
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,907
At least...

31
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,785
it's been that way till now.

32
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,368
Where is he?

33
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,802
Where is he?

34
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,104
I have no idea 
 where he'd be today.

35
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:05,754
- Hold still. 
 - But Guy...

36
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:08,757
- Hold still, I said. 
 - You hurt me with those hands of yours.

37
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,593
- Then do as I tell ya. 
 - Stop it!

38
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,512
Now see, you've made me drop the soap.

39
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:18,516
- Wait, I'll get it for ya. 
 - You're killing me.

40
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,480
Oh, look. What's that?

41
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,400
Pardon me, ma'am.

42
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,950
I'll kill you for this.

43
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,340
There you are. 
 A thousand dollars.

44
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:08,019
What do you know about Cavanagh?

45
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:11,147
About a week ago 
 he was seen at White Rocks.

46
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,358
Thanks.

47
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,694
If it's of any interest to ya...

48
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:18,363
somebody else dropped in 
 to see me about him.

49
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:20,657
Who?

50
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,493
I'd never seen him before.

51
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,162
His name is Monco.

52
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:52,332
Light?

53
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,920
You know Baby Cavanagh?

54
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:02,759
Now tell me, 
 you know where I can find him?

55
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:12,769
There, at that table.

56
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,813
He's got his back to ya.

57
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,443
Thanks.

58
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,719
Two cards.

59
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:09,719
Didn't hear what the bet was.

60
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:14,432
Your life.

61
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:46,506
Alive or dead... 
 it's your choice.

62
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,928
Let Red go.

63
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:31,843
Two thousand dollars. 
 It's a lot of money.

64
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:34,137
Takes me three years to earn it.

65
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,475
Tell me, isn't a sheriff 
 supposed to be courageous, loyal...

66
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:40,477
and above all, honest?

67
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:43,688
Yeah, that he is.

68
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:58,536
I think you people 
 need a new sheriff.

69
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:01,428
Hughie.

70
00:21:37,547 --> 00:21:39,507
How are you, Nino?

71
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:41,509
Better when I see you.

72
00:21:54,689 --> 00:21:56,649
Go on. Go ahead.

73
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:20,090
Open it.

74
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:42,237
- What's up? Who is it? 
 - Rodriguez, senor.

75
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,938
You. Come along.

76
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:34,122
I'm letting you live, hero.

77
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:37,417
That's so you can tell everybody 
 you've seen what takes place here.

78
00:24:33,181 --> 00:24:35,100
For the lousy money.

79
00:24:43,316 --> 00:24:45,777
You took money 
 to put me behind bars.

80
00:24:48,822 --> 00:24:50,740
You should've killed me 
 when you could.

81
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:53,493
It would be better for you.

82
00:24:54,828 --> 00:24:56,830
And for them.

83
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:02,293
How old's the boy?

84
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,133
How old is the boy, I asked?

85
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,760
He's 18 months now.

86
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:15,056
Just the time that I was in jail.

87
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:20,061
You used the reward that you got...

88
00:25:20,103 --> 00:25:22,522
to start raising a family.

89
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,443
And that's why I feel 
 your family is partly mine.

90
00:25:29,112 --> 00:25:31,531
I'll take my part now.

91
00:25:31,614 --> 00:25:33,533
Outside.

92
00:25:37,037 --> 00:25:40,999
They're both innocent. Please let them 
 go! I was the one. You know that.

93
00:26:09,361 --> 00:26:12,864
I know. 
 I'm sure you hate me just enough.

94
00:26:36,137 --> 00:26:38,682
This time you'll have a chance 
 to shoot me, but not in the back.

95
00:26:42,477 --> 00:26:43,687
Let go.

96
00:26:50,151 --> 00:26:52,404
When you hear the music finish, begin.

97
00:26:54,072 --> 00:26:56,032
Or do you think you can?

98
00:26:59,536 --> 00:27:01,621
Let's start.

99
00:28:57,737 --> 00:28:59,698
Now.

100
00:29:38,445 --> 00:29:41,281
- Check those figures again. 
 - Yes, sir.

101
00:29:44,325 --> 00:29:46,619
Good day, sir. Good afternoon.

102
00:29:46,703 --> 00:29:49,330
Mortimer.

103
00:29:49,414 --> 00:29:52,459
- Douglas Mortimer. 
 - Mortimer. Virginia, isn't it?

104
00:29:52,542 --> 00:29:55,253
- Carolina. 
 - That's right, Carolina.

105
00:29:55,337 --> 00:29:57,589
Can I help in some way?

106
00:29:57,672 --> 00:30:01,634
- I'm looking for a first-class bank. 
 - Oh, but exactly.

107
00:30:01,718 --> 00:30:03,178
Yeah.

108
00:30:03,219 --> 00:30:06,598
The largest and most secure bank 
 in the territory.

109
00:30:06,681 --> 00:30:09,517
Well, Mr. Mortimer, 
 I want to assure you our bank here...

110
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:12,228
has everything... 
 all the safeguards you're looking for.

111
00:30:12,312 --> 00:30:15,565
I don't doubt that, but I have 
 a large sum to deposit.

112
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:17,776
Now, suppose I'm a bandit.

113
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:22,530
A bandit?

114
00:30:22,614 --> 00:30:25,617
A very dangerous bandit 
 with a gang of killers.

115
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:30,372
What would be the most 
 impossible bank for me to rob?

116
00:30:30,455 --> 00:30:34,084
In your case, the one bank 
 I would suggest is the Bank of El Paso.

117
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:36,336
Not even Indio would dare 
 to attack that one.

118
00:30:36,378 --> 00:30:38,963
It's not a bank. 
 It's a fortress there.

119
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:46,429
What time's the next train 
 for El Paso?

120
00:30:46,513 --> 00:30:48,932
11:30. I'll telegraph 
 to my colleague...

121
00:30:49,015 --> 00:30:51,309
in the Bank of El Paso 
 that you're going to arrive.

122
00:30:51,393 --> 00:30:53,436
Thanks.

123
00:31:18,503 --> 00:31:21,214
Hey, mister. Captain. 
 General. Welcome.

124
00:31:21,256 --> 00:31:24,634
Do you need a stable or a room? 
 Do you want to take a bath?

125
00:31:24,676 --> 00:31:27,470
My name is Fernando. 
 The stable is right here.

126
00:31:27,512 --> 00:31:29,305
And that is your hotel.

127
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:32,976
Why this hotel 
 and not some other?

128
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:35,687
You probably wouldn't like 
 that other place as much, senor.

129
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:39,024
You'd have to spend half the night 
 shootin' cockroaches.

130
00:31:39,107 --> 00:31:41,484
At this hotel, the rooms 
 will cost you so much less.

131
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:43,528
And there's a landlady 
 at this one, senor.

132
00:31:45,196 --> 00:31:47,490
- Married? 
 - Yes, but she doesn't care.

133
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:09,763
That's the bank. As soon as I get 
 some money, I'll put it in.

134
00:32:09,846 --> 00:32:12,140
Well, you're gonna have 
 to earn it first.

135
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:16,561
I have 50 cents here for you 
 if you'll let me know...

136
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:21,107
when anybody you've never seen before 
 here in El Paso comes to town.

137
00:32:21,191 --> 00:32:24,402
At the hotel, senor. 
 A stranger just came outta there.

138
00:32:31,534 --> 00:32:33,453
Where's he staying?

139
00:32:42,545 --> 00:32:44,464
The hotel.

140
00:32:48,176 --> 00:32:50,804
Let me know if you see 
 any more strangers.

141
00:32:50,887 --> 00:32:53,139
Sure, senor.

142
00:33:08,405 --> 00:33:11,658
- Help you, sir? 
 - I want the room right above.

143
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:15,078
I'm sorry, it's occupied. 
 It's too bad.

144
00:33:15,161 --> 00:33:17,997
The hotel's filled to capacity. 
 I'm sorry.

145
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:21,126
The room you want is our best. 
 It's always occupied.

146
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:22,335
By who?

147
00:33:23,378 --> 00:33:25,130
Check the register.

148
00:33:25,171 --> 00:33:26,798
Mary!

149
00:33:28,466 --> 00:33:30,719
It's Senor Martinez.

150
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:42,564
- It's free now. 
 - That room is taken!

151
00:33:43,898 --> 00:33:45,817
I'll see to it.

152
00:33:51,031 --> 00:33:54,284
He's nothing but a wild, 
 vicious animal!

153
00:33:54,367 --> 00:33:56,286
He's tall, isn't he?

154
00:34:00,373 --> 00:34:02,292
You're just dirty!

155
00:34:14,637 --> 00:34:17,349
Proprietor, quick! My bill!

156
00:34:17,432 --> 00:34:19,351
I want my bill!

157
00:34:21,603 --> 00:34:24,647
- Before he comes down, give me my bill. 
 - There's no need to check out.

158
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:27,942
Everything's gonna be all right. 
 I'll give you another room immediately.

159
00:34:27,984 --> 00:34:31,279
It's the best in the whole hotel. 
 We'll let him have the bridal suite.

160
00:34:31,363 --> 00:34:33,698
No, Mary, the bill. 
 I'd like to stay, only I can't.

161
00:34:33,782 --> 00:34:36,493
- Don't go, Mr. Martinez. 
 - I have an appointment elsewhere.

162
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:42,957
Yes, senor, what do you want?

163
00:34:48,922 --> 00:34:50,840
I don't wear 'em.

164
00:34:50,924 --> 00:34:53,051
I'm honored that you thought of me. 
 Thank you.

165
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:35,427
Watch this.

166
00:35:59,284 --> 00:36:01,202
Hello, my friends.

167
00:36:02,454 --> 00:36:04,289
Hello, Indio.

168
00:36:04,372 --> 00:36:07,334
You see, I didn't waste 
 a minute coming here.

169
00:36:07,334 --> 00:36:10,253
Indio calls and Groggy 
 comes running right away.

170
00:36:10,337 --> 00:36:11,838
And Sancho?

171
00:36:11,921 --> 00:36:15,759
If you're waiting for Sancho, I'll go 
 and come back in about four years.

172
00:36:15,842 --> 00:36:19,179
He's in prison for four years.

173
00:36:25,852 --> 00:36:29,397
Bad for him. 
 Not so bad for the rest of us.

174
00:36:29,481 --> 00:36:32,442
A man who gets caught 
 doesn't deserve respect, huh?

175
00:36:34,903 --> 00:36:37,113
What's it all about, huh?

176
00:36:37,155 --> 00:36:38,698
Now just listen.

177
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,704
A bank at El Paso.

178
00:36:46,581 --> 00:36:47,999
Let's see.

179
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:53,088
We'll say this is the inside 
 of the bank. Nino is the safe.

180
00:36:53,171 --> 00:36:56,174
Which weighs three tons 
 and can't be opened with dynamite.

181
00:36:57,801 --> 00:36:59,719
There's the part with two cashiers.

182
00:37:01,054 --> 00:37:03,682
This is the manager's desk.

183
00:37:03,723 --> 00:37:06,518
Right in back is a fancy cabinet 
 containing bottles...

184
00:37:06,601 --> 00:37:09,187
for offering drinks 
 to the rich depositors.

185
00:37:11,106 --> 00:37:15,193
There's the main door, and opposite 
 they built a double wall.

186
00:37:15,276 --> 00:37:17,237
What happens, Groggy?

187
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:21,324
Let's say you've already killed 
 the two cashiers and the manager.

188
00:37:21,408 --> 00:37:25,328
For the next few minutes, 
 you're the boss of the bank.

189
00:37:25,412 --> 00:37:27,330
Now what?

190
00:37:28,373 --> 00:37:30,625
The time's been wasted.

191
00:37:32,252 --> 00:37:35,964
Right, a waste of time. 
 Especially, Groggy, to blast open...

192
00:37:36,047 --> 00:37:39,759
that damn iron safe, we'd have 
 to be using so much dynamite...

193
00:37:39,843 --> 00:37:42,762
that the whole bank 
 would just disappear.

194
00:37:42,846 --> 00:37:45,849
And you'd all go up with it.

195
00:37:45,932 --> 00:37:50,645
Besides, the presence of a safe alone 
 doesn't always signify...

196
00:37:50,729 --> 00:37:52,564
that there is money inside.

197
00:37:54,232 --> 00:37:56,151
To help you understand what I mean...

198
00:37:58,486 --> 00:38:02,907
I would like to relate 
 a nice little parable.

199
00:38:05,577 --> 00:38:08,329
Once upon a time 
 there was a carpenter.

200
00:38:10,582 --> 00:38:12,792
You don't think a carpenter 
 can make money, eh?

201
00:38:13,877 --> 00:38:16,338
No? You're wrong.

202
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:22,177
This one did well because 
 he was a builder of safes.

203
00:38:23,386 --> 00:38:25,555
There was a banker once...

204
00:38:25,638 --> 00:38:28,266
who decided he must have 
 his iron safe disguised...

205
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:31,895
to look like a wood cabinet.

206
00:38:35,065 --> 00:38:36,983
To get it made...

207
00:38:37,067 --> 00:38:41,654
the banker goes to our carpenter 
 for the job, and one day...

208
00:38:42,781 --> 00:38:44,866
as destiny has it...

209
00:38:44,949 --> 00:38:47,535
the carpenter's in El Paso.

210
00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:50,789
He happens to walk into the bank there, 
 and what does he find?

211
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:52,999
The cabinet.

212
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:57,128
Since he'd worked on the cabinet, 
 he spotted it right away.

213
00:38:58,004 --> 00:39:00,799
From that day on, 
 he couldn't work anymore.

214
00:39:00,882 --> 00:39:03,927
Pity, because...

215
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:06,846
there was something he had to do.

216
00:39:06,888 --> 00:39:09,683
There was this crazy idea.

217
00:39:09,766 --> 00:39:11,685
And it stayed...

218
00:39:15,814 --> 00:39:18,566
to put his hands on the money inside.

219
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:20,568
Get in there and grab all the money.

220
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:26,199
Sure, you think that carpenter 
 was lucky the way things work out...

221
00:39:26,282 --> 00:39:28,660
that he was lucky 
 to go in just that bank.

222
00:39:28,743 --> 00:39:30,662
It wasn't true.

223
00:39:32,706 --> 00:39:34,916
His good fortune stopped that day.

224
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,377
Because later...

225
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,379
as a prisoner...

226
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:44,050
he ran into me.

227
00:39:49,014 --> 00:39:52,475
The carpenter told me the story, 
 and I tell you.

228
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:01,192
The money isn't in the safe. 
 It's right in this!

229
00:40:04,821 --> 00:40:07,365
Almost a million dollars in it.

230
00:40:10,201 --> 00:40:12,746
Your colleague in Tucumcari told me 
 that this bank...

231
00:40:12,829 --> 00:40:15,999
has the largest deposits 
 in the whole state.

232
00:40:16,082 --> 00:40:18,209
Yes, that's correct, 
 Mr. Mortimer.

233
00:40:18,293 --> 00:40:22,464
Here at the bank at El Paso we have half 
 a million dollars in reserve on hand.

234
00:40:25,467 --> 00:40:29,304
I see. You sure this bank 
 is secure enough to hold that much?

235
00:40:29,387 --> 00:40:32,223
From the moment your money's 
 on deposit here...

236
00:40:32,307 --> 00:40:34,225
you can sleep without any worries.

237
00:40:37,395 --> 00:40:39,773
Besides...

238
00:40:39,814 --> 00:40:42,567
when the bank is closed, 
 an armed guard always remains here...

239
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:45,236
and a patrol 
 is on guard outside.

240
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:49,324
Even the Bank of San Francisco 
 isn't that well protected.

241
00:40:49,407 --> 00:40:53,036
Exactly. The truth is...

242
00:40:54,329 --> 00:40:56,414
to try robbing us 
 would be so futile...

243
00:40:56,498 --> 00:40:59,876
that only a complete fool 
 would attempt it.

244
00:40:59,918 --> 00:41:02,045
Yeah.

245
00:41:02,128 --> 00:41:04,172
Or a complete madman.

246
00:41:14,891 --> 00:41:17,060
Get out of the way! 
 Get out of here!

247
00:42:03,023 --> 00:42:04,941
More news, amigo.

248
00:42:07,193 --> 00:42:09,946
Another stranger in town?

249
00:42:09,988 --> 00:42:12,657
Yes. And I know something else.

250
00:42:18,413 --> 00:42:21,958
There was another stranger 
 I didn't tell you about.

251
00:42:22,042 --> 00:42:25,003
Listen to me, 
 you sawed-off little runt!

252
00:42:25,045 --> 00:42:27,547
I want to know how many men 
 there are all together.

253
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:30,008
Well, there were two. 
 Now there's two more.

254
00:42:30,091 --> 00:42:32,469
Where?

255
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:34,888
In the saloon.

256
00:44:44,768 --> 00:44:46,102
Whiskey.

257
00:44:46,186 --> 00:44:49,356
Listen, mister, why do you choose 
 my place to commit suicide?

258
00:44:49,439 --> 00:44:52,859
I know that man. 
 It's a miracle you're alive.

259
00:44:52,942 --> 00:44:56,529
Why should a man walk around with 
 a pistol and let himself be insulted?

260
00:44:56,613 --> 00:44:58,573
It's mighty strange.

261
00:44:58,615 --> 00:45:00,575
If the hunchback didn't shoot you...

262
00:45:00,658 --> 00:45:04,120
he had a very important reason, 
 that's all.

263
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:07,832
I was thinking that myself.

264
00:46:07,851 --> 00:46:10,437
1, 2...

265
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:14,774
3, now 4, now 5...

266
00:46:22,991 --> 00:46:26,327
11, 12, 13...

267
00:46:26,411 --> 00:46:29,873
14, 15, 16...

268
00:46:29,956 --> 00:46:34,336
17, 18, 19...

269
00:46:34,419 --> 00:46:38,631
20, 21, 22...

270
00:46:38,715 --> 00:46:41,718
23, 24...

271
00:46:41,801 --> 00:46:44,637
25, 26...

272
00:46:44,679 --> 00:46:49,768
27, 28, 29...

273
00:46:49,851 --> 00:46:52,687
30, 31...

274
00:46:52,771 --> 00:46:56,107
32 and 33.

275
00:48:41,171 --> 00:48:43,131
All right, now.

276
00:48:44,674 --> 00:48:47,344
I don't know him!

277
00:48:47,427 --> 00:48:49,387
Come on, now, you know everybody.

278
00:48:49,429 --> 00:48:53,224
I don't know anybody anymore! 
 I'm dead! Understand?

279
00:48:53,308 --> 00:48:55,769
Well, there was a time 
 when I knew everybody.

280
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:58,646
That was a long time ago 
 when all this was prairie.

281
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:01,149
In these days everybody's in a hurry. 
 That's right...

282
00:49:01,232 --> 00:49:03,818
with your damned 
 good-for-nothing trains!

283
00:49:07,197 --> 00:49:08,656
Disgusting!

284
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:11,076
One day, someone from the railroad 
 comes here to see me.

285
00:49:11,159 --> 00:49:14,829
He says, Prophet, the railway's 
 gonna go right past your house.

286
00:49:14,913 --> 00:49:17,832
Is that so? I said.

287
00:49:17,916 --> 00:49:20,251
Yep, that right, he says.

288
00:49:20,335 --> 00:49:22,545
All those trains 
 gonna go right past here.

289
00:49:22,629 --> 00:49:24,964
The best thing for you, Prophet, 
 is sell your land to the company...

290
00:49:25,006 --> 00:49:26,758
or else we'll buy Baker's.

291
00:49:26,841 --> 00:49:29,594
He lives next to your place, 
 and I'll put the tracks here...

292
00:49:29,678 --> 00:49:31,805
and that'll make you go crazy.

293
00:49:31,846 --> 00:49:34,015
Will you sell out 
 to our company, Prophet?

294
00:49:34,099 --> 00:49:36,601
Oh, is that so? Says I.

295
00:49:38,436 --> 00:49:40,855
He was very anxious 
 for me to sell out.

296
00:49:40,897 --> 00:49:43,191
You know what I told him 
 about the railroad?

297
00:49:43,274 --> 00:49:46,111
You know what I told him 
 he could do with his railroad?

298
00:50:05,171 --> 00:50:07,882
You know what my decision 
 about selling was?

299
00:50:07,966 --> 00:50:09,884
Well, you said no.

300
00:50:09,926 --> 00:50:13,346
You're right about that. 
 No to him and his damn trains!

301
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:15,348
I wouldn't! No!

302
00:50:15,432 --> 00:50:18,351
Look, listen to me, old man.

303
00:50:18,435 --> 00:50:20,353
You're supposed to be a prophet.

304
00:50:20,437 --> 00:50:23,273
I didn't come here to listen to you 
 rattle on about trains.

305
00:50:23,356 --> 00:50:26,735
I want to find out about this man. 
 It's obvious you don't know anything.

306
00:50:26,776 --> 00:50:29,529
No need to be insulting. 
 If that's all you came here to do...

307
00:50:29,612 --> 00:50:32,574
you can clear out of my house fast 
 before I lose my temper.

308
00:50:32,657 --> 00:50:34,576
Understand?

309
00:50:38,371 --> 00:50:40,582
Hey! Where you goin'?

310
00:50:43,585 --> 00:50:46,379
I guess I better leave before 
 you go and lose your temper.

311
00:50:47,464 --> 00:50:49,799
What's the matter with you? 
 Why are you so dang stupid?

312
00:50:49,883 --> 00:50:51,801
Hurry up, 
 give me that pistol there.

313
00:50:51,885 --> 00:50:54,304
Yeah, right there behind ya.

314
00:50:54,346 --> 00:50:56,306
Hurry!

315
00:50:56,348 --> 00:50:59,768
Yes, that's the one. 
 Now, hand it over.

316
00:50:59,809 --> 00:51:03,521
That's it. Give me that gun. 
 The man you asked about.

317
00:51:03,605 --> 00:51:06,566
There's only one question: 
 How does he carry his gun?

318
00:51:06,649 --> 00:51:08,818
He wears it here, 
 across his belly?

319
00:51:08,902 --> 00:51:12,364
Well, why didn't you tell me that 
 in the first place, my boy.

320
00:51:12,447 --> 00:51:14,908
Of course I know the man 
 you're trying to find out about.

321
00:51:14,991 --> 00:51:16,910
Of course I know him.

322
00:51:16,993 --> 00:51:19,829
He's Colonel Douglas Mortimer.

323
00:51:19,871 --> 00:51:22,791
Mortimer... a brave man, a soldier.

324
00:51:23,625 --> 00:51:26,127
He was known as the best shot 
 in the Carolinas.

325
00:51:26,211 --> 00:51:27,837
A great soldier.

326
00:51:27,921 --> 00:51:31,800
Now he's reduced to being 
 a bounty killer, same as you.

327
00:51:31,883 --> 00:51:33,635
Because of trains!

328
00:51:33,718 --> 00:51:36,971
Because of the damn trains! 
 Damn 'em!

329
00:53:03,433 --> 00:53:07,354
Take it to the station. 
 The gentleman's leavin'.

330
00:53:11,983 --> 00:53:13,735
Hold it.

331
00:53:15,737 --> 00:53:17,197
Take it back.

332
00:53:20,492 --> 00:53:22,535
Take it to the station.

333
00:53:24,621 --> 00:53:27,540
- Go inside. 
 - The station!

334
00:54:36,568 --> 00:54:38,737
Just like the games we know.

335
00:55:34,417 --> 00:55:36,628
- He's picking it up. 
 - A trick, maybe.

336
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:26,821
How can somebody in my business 
 go around with a contraption like this?

337
00:57:27,906 --> 00:57:29,824
That contraption...

338
00:57:31,117 --> 00:57:33,328
almost sent you to your grave.

339
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:38,541
You're forgetting one thing, Colonel... 
 I was shooting at your hat.

340
00:57:38,625 --> 00:57:40,835
Well, I was only shooting at yours.

341
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,172
But I recall firing first.

342
00:57:46,174 --> 00:57:48,009
Boy...

343
00:57:48,093 --> 00:57:51,304
I've reached almost 50 years 
 of age with my system.

344
00:57:51,346 --> 00:57:53,682
Not many men last long 
 in these parts.

345
00:57:53,765 --> 00:57:56,017
How long do you expect to last?

346
00:57:57,769 --> 00:57:59,354
Much longer than that.

347
00:58:00,438 --> 00:58:04,234
When I get my hands on Indio 
 and that $10,000...

348
00:58:04,317 --> 00:58:07,696
I'm gonna buy myself a little place, 
 possibly retire.

349
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:12,242
Well, I don't believe we ought 
 to start another fight.

350
00:58:12,283 --> 00:58:14,369
But you forget one small detail.

351
00:58:14,452 --> 00:58:15,954
What's that?

352
00:58:16,037 --> 00:58:18,331
I wanna get my hands on Indio too.

353
00:58:18,373 --> 00:58:20,792
Sure, after me.

354
00:58:22,502 --> 00:58:24,754
Or before you.

355
00:58:24,796 --> 00:58:26,756
Or at the same time.

356
00:58:29,884 --> 00:58:31,553
Is that a proposition?

357
00:58:32,971 --> 00:58:34,514
An equal partnership.

358
00:58:35,598 --> 00:58:37,434
Why? Why should I?

359
00:58:37,517 --> 00:58:39,477
I can think of three reasons.

360
00:58:39,519 --> 00:58:41,688
First is there's 14 of them.

361
00:58:41,771 --> 00:58:43,690
Yeah, that's a lot.

362
00:58:43,732 --> 00:58:45,275
A lot for me.

363
00:58:45,358 --> 00:58:47,902
Yeah. No small number 
 even for two of us.

364
00:58:47,986 --> 00:58:49,571
Second reason?

365
00:58:50,864 --> 00:58:52,907
Second reason...

366
00:58:55,452 --> 00:58:58,079
The second reason is 
 you could make it 15 to one.

367
00:58:58,163 --> 00:59:00,623
Don't forget I wanna play 
 in this game too.

368
00:59:00,707 --> 00:59:05,086
As you're aware, when two hunters 
 go after the same prey...

369
00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:08,590
they usually end up shooting each other 
 in the back, and we don't want that.

370
00:59:12,969 --> 00:59:15,138
Then the colonel dies, hmm?

371
00:59:17,474 --> 00:59:19,351
All right, I'll be generous.

372
00:59:21,102 --> 00:59:23,688
You can have the reward 
 for Indio...

373
00:59:23,772 --> 00:59:25,982
and I'll take the reward 
 for the rest of the band.

374
00:59:29,319 --> 00:59:31,363
All wrong.

375
00:59:31,446 --> 00:59:35,950
Indio's worth $10,000 dollars, but 
 the rest adds up to much more than that.

376
00:59:35,992 --> 00:59:39,579
Blackie's worth four, 
 Wild's worth three, Nino two.

377
00:59:39,662 --> 00:59:41,331
Nino's one.

378
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,419
Well, Frisco's worth two.

379
00:59:46,503 --> 00:59:48,963
That's ten thousand.

380
00:59:49,047 --> 00:59:50,924
Yeah, but...

381
00:59:51,007 --> 00:59:54,219
there's a few more that'll 
 add up to more than that, I'm sure.

382
00:59:54,302 --> 00:59:57,514
- How do you know that? 
 - I have my information.

383
00:59:57,597 --> 00:59:59,516
When all's said and done...

384
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:02,686
I think I might just take you up 
 on your proposition.

385
01:00:05,897 --> 01:00:08,149
Let's drink to this partnership.

386
01:00:11,945 --> 01:00:15,198
To the partnership, 
 with no tricks, of course.

387
01:00:16,324 --> 01:00:17,992
No tricks.

388
01:00:22,038 --> 01:00:23,456
Now, then...

389
01:00:23,498 --> 01:00:27,919
you realize we're gonna have to figure 
 out some way to get them in the middle.

390
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:34,801
One from the outside, one from 
 the inside. There's no other way.

391
01:00:34,884 --> 01:00:38,346
One of us will have to 
 join Indio's band.

392
01:00:40,473 --> 01:00:43,018
Why are you looking at me 
 when you say one of us?

393
01:00:43,101 --> 01:00:44,769
Because they don't know you.

394
01:00:44,811 --> 01:00:47,689
Wild sees me and his hump 
 will catch on fire.

395
01:00:50,275 --> 01:00:51,860
Tell me...

396
01:00:51,943 --> 01:00:55,071
how do you propose that I 
 join up with Indio?

397
01:00:55,155 --> 01:00:58,116
Maybe bring him 
 a bunch of roses?

398
01:00:58,199 --> 01:01:02,662
You could do that, but I'd suggest 
 you take him Sancho Perez.

399
01:01:02,746 --> 01:01:04,998
Who's Sancho Perez?

400
01:01:05,081 --> 01:01:08,001
A friend of Indio's. 
 Right now he's cooling off.

401
01:01:08,084 --> 01:01:10,712
He's cooling off 
 in Alamogourdo jail.

402
01:01:10,754 --> 01:01:13,340
How do you know all this?

403
01:01:14,591 --> 01:01:16,843
I've got my information too.

404
01:01:18,928 --> 01:01:22,974
Naturally, you'll have to arrange 
 for his, uh, release.

405
01:01:25,685 --> 01:01:27,145
Naturally.

406
01:01:29,022 --> 01:01:30,982
Tell me...

407
01:01:31,066 --> 01:01:33,485
were you ever young?

408
01:01:37,113 --> 01:01:39,282
And just as reckless as you.

409
01:01:42,744 --> 01:01:45,663
Then one day something happened.

410
01:01:45,747 --> 01:01:47,499
Made life very precious to me.

411
01:01:47,582 --> 01:01:49,167
What's that?

412
01:01:55,131 --> 01:01:57,550
Or is the question indiscreet?

413
01:02:00,553 --> 01:02:02,639
The question isn't indiscreet.

414
01:02:04,015 --> 01:02:06,017
But the answer could be.

415
01:05:20,337 --> 01:05:24,466
They told me you were put away. You'd be 
 resting for four long years in prison.

416
01:05:27,177 --> 01:05:31,139
No, Indio, for four weeks. 
 No more than four weeks.

417
01:05:42,776 --> 01:05:44,611
Who is that with you?

418
01:05:44,652 --> 01:05:47,781
He got me out. 
 The man's a friend of mine.

419
01:05:55,330 --> 01:05:58,291
Why did he help you? 
 Did you ask him that?

420
01:05:59,959 --> 01:06:03,338
Yeah. Amigo, why did you 
 help me out?

421
01:06:05,298 --> 01:06:10,428
Well, there's such a big reward 
 being offered on all you gentlemen...

422
01:06:10,512 --> 01:06:13,682
that I thought I might just tag along 
 on your next robbery.

423
01:06:14,933 --> 01:06:16,851
I might just turn you 
 into the law.

424
01:06:59,728 --> 01:07:01,312
Amigo...

425
01:07:02,939 --> 01:07:06,151
that's the one answer 
 that would prove you're all right.

426
01:07:08,361 --> 01:07:11,823
And you arrived just in time too. 
 The job is already set.

427
01:07:12,907 --> 01:07:14,451
It's tomorrow.

428
01:07:15,577 --> 01:07:17,662
The place is...

429
01:07:17,746 --> 01:07:20,206
the bank in El Paso.

430
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:25,670
Not far from El Paso 
 there's a little town, Santa Cruz.

431
01:07:25,754 --> 01:07:29,215
Tomorrow, Blackie, Chico, 
 Paco...

432
01:07:29,299 --> 01:07:32,469
and you, amigo...

433
01:07:32,552 --> 01:07:35,138
will rob the bank in Santa Cruz.

434
01:07:35,221 --> 01:07:38,391
Shoot, kill, get every gun 
 in the area after you...

435
01:07:38,475 --> 01:07:40,393
especially those from El Paso.

436
01:07:40,477 --> 01:07:43,855
Any others around, 
 we'll take care of them.

437
01:07:45,690 --> 01:07:48,651
And then after the job, 
 we'll all meet again at Las Palmeras.

438
01:07:53,156 --> 01:07:55,408
Where are you going?

439
01:08:01,414 --> 01:08:04,209
Well, if there's gonna be 
 any shooting...

440
01:08:05,251 --> 01:08:07,212
I gotta get my rest.

441
01:08:24,354 --> 01:08:28,983
Hey, amigo, you know when you told 
 that story yesterday, I fell for it.

442
01:08:29,025 --> 01:08:31,403
Big joke, wasn't it, amigo?

443
01:08:40,704 --> 01:08:42,497
Who said I was jokin'?

444
01:08:44,791 --> 01:08:46,751
I don't get that. 
 If it's true...

445
01:08:46,835 --> 01:08:49,254
Too bad you have to die.

446
01:08:53,425 --> 01:08:54,926
What is it?

447
01:09:50,774 --> 01:09:53,693
By now they should be 
 at Santa Cruz.

448
01:10:36,027 --> 01:10:37,570
Listen, shorty...

449
01:10:41,157 --> 01:10:44,953
Indio and his band have just 
 robbed the bank here in town.

450
01:10:45,036 --> 01:10:48,456
Now why don't you just sit down 
 and send out the alarm to El Paso...

451
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:51,418
and the rest of the towns around here 
 and warn 'em, right?

452
01:10:51,459 --> 01:10:55,171
But, mister, I didn't hear any shots 
 at the bank, and I sure would have.

453
01:10:55,255 --> 01:10:57,173
You might hear one.

454
01:10:57,257 --> 01:10:58,883
The alarm.

455
01:11:42,385 --> 01:11:44,387
Easy now.

456
01:11:44,471 --> 01:11:47,182
They've robbed the bank 
 at Santa Cruz!

457
01:11:48,850 --> 01:11:50,518
Follow me!

458
01:13:28,783 --> 01:13:31,619
Groggy, the telegraph wires.

459
01:15:25,316 --> 01:15:27,485
- Good day, gentlemen. 
 - Good day, sir.

460
01:15:30,488 --> 01:15:32,824
- Sir. 
 - Good afternoon.

461
01:17:22,892 --> 01:17:24,602
The other side.

462
01:18:08,563 --> 01:18:10,482
Eleven...

463
01:18:10,523 --> 01:18:11,941
twelve...

464
01:18:14,944 --> 01:18:16,738
Fourteen...

465
01:20:58,108 --> 01:20:59,734
Let's go!

466
01:22:23,026 --> 01:22:26,321
What are you doin' here? 
 You're not runnin' away, are you?

467
01:22:26,363 --> 01:22:28,114
No, I'm not running away.

468
01:22:28,198 --> 01:22:31,868
I'm going after them and I'm going 
 alone. Our partnership is dissolved.

469
01:22:31,910 --> 01:22:33,745
Boy, let's wait 
 and talk it over.

470
01:22:33,828 --> 01:22:37,957
All we've done is talk. 
 I've been reasonable with no results.

471
01:22:38,041 --> 01:22:41,336
Now take it easy. We only knew 
 the Santa Cruz part of this plan.

472
01:22:41,378 --> 01:22:44,547
You were the one who had 
 their strategy all worked out.

473
01:22:44,589 --> 01:22:47,217
- Now I'm gonna meet Indio. 
 - I see. I better go along.

474
01:22:48,301 --> 01:22:50,220
I'm going alone... Me.

475
01:22:50,303 --> 01:22:53,723
I have an appointment with Indio 
 and I'm not gonna let anyone interfere.

476
01:22:53,765 --> 01:22:56,768
- You certain about that? 
 - That's right.

477
01:22:56,851 --> 01:22:59,312
In that case I'm sorry.

478
01:23:03,191 --> 01:23:07,904
That's not bad. Indio sent 
 four men to Santa Cruz.

479
01:23:07,946 --> 01:23:11,157
And one man returns... 
 a new man without a scratch.

480
01:23:11,241 --> 01:23:13,368
Mm-mm. Indio's no idiot.

481
01:23:13,451 --> 01:23:16,913
When you ride up to him and show him 
 that little nick, he might believe you.

482
01:23:17,997 --> 01:23:20,125
And don't forget, 
 that as of today...

483
01:23:20,166 --> 01:23:22,794
the whole gang's worth 
 $40,000 more.

484
01:23:22,877 --> 01:23:25,922
That's the reward offered by the bank 
 to get the money back.

485
01:23:26,006 --> 01:23:29,801
- Is the partnership operating again? 
 - Just how do you figure?

486
01:23:29,884 --> 01:23:34,764
Try to convince Indio to go north, 
 and then go along the Rio Bravo.

487
01:23:34,806 --> 01:23:38,018
It's a good spot for an ambush 
 and we can get him between two fires.

488
01:23:38,101 --> 01:23:41,896
You on the outside, 
 me on the inside, right?

489
01:23:43,273 --> 01:23:44,566
North?

490
01:23:48,820 --> 01:23:50,321
North.

491
01:24:09,507 --> 01:24:11,217
Hughie.

492
01:24:19,059 --> 01:24:23,521
Wait a minute. We need time to open it 
 and this isn't the right place.

493
01:24:53,093 --> 01:24:54,719
And the others?

494
01:24:54,803 --> 01:24:56,221
Dead?

495
01:24:57,430 --> 01:25:01,935
After Santa Cruz, we headed for El Paso 
 and they hit us from all sides.

496
01:25:03,436 --> 01:25:06,731
And you just saved your own skin, 
 isn't that right, you yellow...

497
01:25:26,292 --> 01:25:29,587
You did your part of it. 
 Let's go.

498
01:25:29,671 --> 01:25:31,297
Which way we headed?

499
01:25:32,382 --> 01:25:33,758
North.

500
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:37,012
North? Along Rio Bravo canyon?

501
01:25:37,053 --> 01:25:38,680
Why not?

502
01:25:40,056 --> 01:25:42,517
Seems like a good place 
 for an ambush to me.

503
01:25:44,644 --> 01:25:46,563
You know a better way to go?

504
01:25:46,646 --> 01:25:48,565
Yeah, south.

505
01:25:50,650 --> 01:25:52,277
Ride to the border?

506
01:25:52,318 --> 01:25:56,364
They'll never expect you to cross the 
 border now that the alarm's been sent.

507
01:26:02,829 --> 01:26:05,081
Think we'll head east.

508
01:26:05,165 --> 01:26:08,460
There's a place I know about, 
 Agua Caliente.

509
01:26:09,544 --> 01:26:12,547
Here we are. 
 That's Agua Caliente.

510
01:26:13,631 --> 01:26:16,468
Yes, I have many friends here.

511
01:26:16,509 --> 01:26:18,470
It looks just like a morgue.

512
01:26:19,637 --> 01:26:21,639
But look out.

513
01:26:21,723 --> 01:26:23,892
It could be one so easily.

514
01:26:25,101 --> 01:26:28,521
- They don't like strangers. 
 - No, they don't like anybody.

515
01:26:30,398 --> 01:26:34,361
Wild, you never saw 
 our friend here shoot, right?

516
01:26:38,448 --> 01:26:40,200
Did any of you?

517
01:26:43,203 --> 01:26:45,830
We don't know how you'd be 
 in emergencies.

518
01:26:46,956 --> 01:26:49,501
I was thinking, 
 this is the right place.

519
01:26:49,584 --> 01:26:51,836
I got a way 
 you can show the men.

520
01:26:54,255 --> 01:26:55,799
How's that?

521
01:26:57,258 --> 01:26:59,052
Go into town alone, amigo.

522
01:29:45,677 --> 01:29:46,803
Bravo.

523
01:30:37,437 --> 01:30:40,190
Do you mind tellin' me 
 how you got here?

524
01:30:40,231 --> 01:30:42,859
I just reasoned it out.

525
01:30:42,901 --> 01:30:45,070
I figured you'd tell Indio...

526
01:30:45,153 --> 01:30:48,656
to do just exactly the opposite 
 of what we agreed...

527
01:30:48,740 --> 01:30:51,576
and he's suspicious enough 
 to figure out somethin' else.

528
01:30:52,786 --> 01:30:56,414
Since El Paso was out of the question, 
 well, here I am.

529
01:30:58,708 --> 01:31:00,543
Rum... a double.

530
01:31:01,628 --> 01:31:03,588
Tequila for all of us.

531
01:31:20,313 --> 01:31:23,066
If it isn't the smoker.

532
01:31:34,202 --> 01:31:36,579
Remember me, amigo?

533
01:31:38,707 --> 01:31:41,876
Of course you do. El Paso.

534
01:31:44,963 --> 01:31:47,465
It's a small world.

535
01:31:47,507 --> 01:31:50,260
Yes, and very, very bad.

536
01:31:51,344 --> 01:31:54,472
Now, come on. 
 You light another match.

537
01:31:56,307 --> 01:32:00,562
I generally smoke just after I eat. 
 Come back in ten minutes.

538
01:32:00,645 --> 01:32:04,566
Ten minutes you'll be smoking 
 in hell. Get up!

539
01:32:04,607 --> 01:32:05,984
Stay calm.

540
01:32:08,278 --> 01:32:10,196
On your feet.

541
01:32:17,912 --> 01:32:19,622
Cucillo.

542
01:32:20,749 --> 01:32:22,250
Count to three.

543
01:32:32,177 --> 01:32:34,054
One...

544
01:32:35,889 --> 01:32:37,515
two...

545
01:32:39,184 --> 01:32:40,769
three!

546
01:32:44,522 --> 01:32:46,191
Stop it!

547
01:33:08,546 --> 01:33:10,215
Who are you?

548
01:33:11,758 --> 01:33:13,718
I'm the one who can open 
 the safe for you.

549
01:33:18,515 --> 01:33:19,933
What safe, senor?

550
01:33:20,016 --> 01:33:23,436
The one from El Paso. 
 You got there ahead of me.

551
01:33:23,478 --> 01:33:25,438
- However... 
 - However?

552
01:33:27,315 --> 01:33:31,069
Open that safe and you're gonna 
 destroy half the bank notes.

553
01:33:31,152 --> 01:33:33,697
I can open it 
 without blowing it up.

554
01:33:42,122 --> 01:33:43,581
What'll it cost?

555
01:33:43,665 --> 01:33:45,125
Five thousand.

556
01:33:48,795 --> 01:33:50,714
Two's all I'll pay you.

557
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:53,591
Five.

558
01:34:30,754 --> 01:34:32,672
Keep your hands off it!

559
01:34:32,714 --> 01:34:36,217
It's easy to steal. 
 The trouble is in keeping the loot.

560
01:34:36,301 --> 01:34:38,553
Take it out.

561
01:34:38,595 --> 01:34:40,889
Now every man in New Mexico 
 is after us.

562
01:34:40,972 --> 01:34:44,642
If they catch one of us with money 
 we'll all end up the same way.

563
01:34:44,726 --> 01:34:48,605
We're going to wait here for an 
 entire month if I think it's necessary.

564
01:34:48,688 --> 01:34:51,649
Then everybody will get his share.

565
01:34:51,733 --> 01:34:54,110
And you will wait a month 
 to get your money.

566
01:34:55,403 --> 01:34:57,072
Naturally.

567
01:34:57,113 --> 01:34:59,491
I'll be in the tavern.

568
01:34:59,574 --> 01:35:03,703
The air around here stinks anyway, 
 just like the food.

569
01:35:03,787 --> 01:35:05,747
But the month will go fast.

570
01:35:45,995 --> 01:35:47,414
Right here.

571
01:35:48,498 --> 01:35:50,083
Let's go.

572
01:38:14,436 --> 01:38:16,563
I was worried about you.

573
01:38:16,646 --> 01:38:20,525
All alone with, uh, 
 so many problems to solve.

574
01:38:37,125 --> 01:38:39,294
It's all right here.

575
01:38:44,632 --> 01:38:46,301
Go ahead.

576
01:39:54,619 --> 01:39:57,205
You shouldn't have shot 
 the apples off that tree.

577
01:40:09,175 --> 01:40:10,635
Put it on.

578
01:41:49,901 --> 01:41:52,904
What's he doing now, 
 this sheriff of El Paso?

579
01:41:52,987 --> 01:41:56,282
Right now? Lookin' for the cash 
 that was in the bank.

580
01:41:57,409 --> 01:41:59,202
Right.

581
01:41:59,285 --> 01:42:04,082
And suppose he finds the bodies 
 of these men just outside El Paso...

582
01:42:04,165 --> 01:42:06,418
with lots of money on them?

583
01:42:08,003 --> 01:42:09,963
What will the sheriff think?

584
01:42:10,046 --> 01:42:11,798
Well, he...

585
01:42:11,881 --> 01:42:13,633
That's right.

586
01:43:32,212 --> 01:43:33,713
Slim.

587
01:43:36,966 --> 01:43:38,551
What is it, Nino?

588
01:43:40,470 --> 01:43:42,180
A change of plans.

589
01:43:42,263 --> 01:43:44,516
Indio wants you to...

590
01:44:25,890 --> 01:44:27,851
It's not loaded.

591
01:44:51,583 --> 01:44:54,252
I think you should 
 get out fast now.

592
01:44:54,336 --> 01:44:57,589
Here's your guns without bullets.

593
01:44:57,630 --> 01:45:00,550
Listen. Don't you let Indio 
 find you both around.

594
01:45:49,265 --> 01:45:52,727
I know you don't like questions, 
 but why are you doing this?

595
01:45:55,772 --> 01:45:58,733
How long have you known 
 that Monco's a bounty killer?

596
01:46:00,652 --> 01:46:02,904
I found out tonight. Why?

597
01:46:06,116 --> 01:46:09,160
I knew he was one from 
 the first moment he arrived.

598
01:46:14,874 --> 01:46:17,794
The other one's also 
 a bounty killer.

599
01:46:19,421 --> 01:46:21,464
So I have an idea.

600
01:46:21,548 --> 01:46:23,717
They'll be useful to us.

601
01:46:25,051 --> 01:46:26,678
We'll try it.

602
01:46:27,762 --> 01:46:31,224
Those men are a lot better 
 than mine with a gun.

603
01:46:31,307 --> 01:46:35,603
So we'll let all of them 
 get mixed up in a gun battle.

604
01:46:35,645 --> 01:46:38,606
But that won't 
 really matter to me.

605
01:46:41,192 --> 01:46:42,736
Or you.

606
01:46:44,863 --> 01:46:47,866
Because we'll be far away, right?

607
01:46:53,371 --> 01:46:56,082
And we'll have all the money.

608
01:46:58,626 --> 01:47:00,462
Go on.

609
01:47:00,503 --> 01:47:02,756
Go on and wake Cucillo.

610
01:47:52,222 --> 01:47:53,515
Who did it?

611
01:47:53,598 --> 01:47:56,184
Why don't you look 
 at the knife?

612
01:48:04,442 --> 01:48:06,403
It's mine.

613
01:48:06,486 --> 01:48:09,447
Then it shouldn't be there, 
 should it?

614
01:48:19,040 --> 01:48:22,210
But I didn't kill him. 
 I didn't do it.

615
01:48:24,713 --> 01:48:27,424
It's difficult to prove that.

616
01:48:30,135 --> 01:48:31,636
I am innocent.

617
01:48:31,720 --> 01:48:34,264
One of your horses is outside.

618
01:48:35,306 --> 01:48:37,767
Let's see if you can get to it.

619
01:49:25,523 --> 01:49:27,025
He just killed Slim.

620
01:49:29,027 --> 01:49:33,239
And he... he helped those 
 two bounty killers get away.

621
01:49:37,035 --> 01:49:38,620
I want them back...

622
01:49:40,246 --> 01:49:41,915
right now.

623
01:49:54,844 --> 01:49:57,180
What are you doing here?

624
01:49:57,263 --> 01:49:59,724
Go and get them back!

625
01:50:03,978 --> 01:50:08,817
Those two bounty killers are sitting on 
 our backs and must be killed right away.

626
01:50:13,905 --> 01:50:15,824
We can't let 'em go free.

627
01:50:30,714 --> 01:50:32,298
It's done now.

628
01:50:34,300 --> 01:50:36,594
Prepare to get out of here.

629
01:51:19,512 --> 01:51:20,805
Here.

630
01:51:22,557 --> 01:51:24,267
Hold it.

631
01:51:28,855 --> 01:51:31,733
Not a bad idea.

632
01:51:31,816 --> 01:51:34,319
But I'm one thing 
 you forgot about.

633
01:51:34,402 --> 01:51:36,112
Open it up now.

634
01:51:57,884 --> 01:52:00,136
All right, come on now, 
 open it.

635
01:52:58,611 --> 01:53:00,822
Leave Indio to me.

636
01:53:03,700 --> 01:53:05,243
All right.

637
01:53:37,567 --> 01:53:39,694
Where in hell is it?

638
01:54:07,972 --> 01:54:11,476
I'll kill 'em, but I'll rip 
 out their guts first.

639
01:54:11,559 --> 01:54:13,478
I have a plan.

640
01:54:19,943 --> 01:54:21,945
What?

641
01:54:22,028 --> 01:54:24,155
Let's just wait.

642
01:54:24,239 --> 01:54:26,324
They'll be back here.

643
01:54:28,410 --> 01:54:31,663
And this way, 
 there'll be two of us.

644
01:54:31,746 --> 01:54:34,916
Can they come back here? 
 Your men could've killed them.

645
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:36,918
Who? They?

646
01:54:40,296 --> 01:54:43,883
Are you sure of that? 
 That they haven't?

647
01:54:47,554 --> 01:54:49,681
I thought something different.

648
01:54:49,764 --> 01:54:54,602
You made the boys ride on out to 
 make sure they're both killed, and fast.

649
01:54:54,686 --> 01:54:57,897
I'm not as dumb 
 as the rest of them.

650
01:54:59,065 --> 01:55:01,026
There was no help for it.

651
01:56:34,536 --> 01:56:36,079
Go on.

652
01:58:24,020 --> 01:58:25,480
That watch...

653
01:58:26,940 --> 01:58:29,734
It's been a long time 
 that I wanted to ask.

654
01:58:31,236 --> 01:58:33,988
I can see that it means 
 a lot to you.

655
01:58:34,072 --> 01:58:35,573
Why?

656
02:00:12,295 --> 02:00:13,880
Listen to me!

657
02:00:15,715 --> 02:00:17,884
This is Colonel Mortimer!

658
02:00:20,512 --> 02:00:22,097
Douglas Mortimer!

659
02:00:24,391 --> 02:00:26,810
Does the name 
 mean anything to you?

660
02:01:59,361 --> 02:02:02,614
When the chimes end, 
 pick up your gun.

661
02:02:02,697 --> 02:02:05,033
Try and shoot me, Colonel.

662
02:02:07,660 --> 02:02:09,704
Just try.

663
02:04:04,819 --> 02:04:07,197
Very careless of you, old man.

664
02:04:33,431 --> 02:04:35,058
Try this.

665
02:04:42,190 --> 02:04:44,109
Now we start.

666
02:06:34,803 --> 02:06:36,096
Bravo.

667
02:07:17,637 --> 02:07:20,265
There seems to be 
 a family resemblance.

668
02:07:26,646 --> 02:07:28,231
Here.

669
02:07:32,902 --> 02:07:35,905
Naturally, between 
 brother and sister.

670
02:07:35,989 --> 02:07:37,532
My gun.

671
02:07:42,620 --> 02:07:43,872
My boy...

672
02:07:44,956 --> 02:07:47,334
you've become rich.

673
02:07:47,417 --> 02:07:50,045
You mean we've become rich, 
 old man.

674
02:07:50,128 --> 02:07:53,214
No, it's all for you. 
 I think you deserve it.

675
02:07:54,299 --> 02:07:56,634
What about our partnership?

676
02:07:59,095 --> 02:08:00,722
Maybe next time.

677
02:08:43,431 --> 02:08:47,644
Ten thousand, twelve thousand...

678
02:08:47,727 --> 02:08:49,145
fifteen...

679
02:08:50,230 --> 02:08:51,856
sixteen...

680
02:08:51,940 --> 02:08:53,233
seventeen...

681
02:08:54,984 --> 02:08:57,195
twenty-two...

682
02:09:04,661 --> 02:09:06,663
Twenty-seven.

683
02:09:08,331 --> 02:09:09,833
Any trouble, boy?

684
02:09:12,377 --> 02:09:13,962
No, old man.

685
02:09:15,380 --> 02:09:18,425
Thought I was having trouble 
 with my adding.

686
02:09:16,506 --> 02:09:17,882
It's all right now.
