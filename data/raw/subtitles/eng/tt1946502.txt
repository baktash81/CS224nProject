00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:12,943
But lately
I'm starting to wonder

167
00:09:12,945 --> 00:09:16,213
with no evidence, no proof,

168
00:09:16,215 --> 00:09:18,982
what if it's not true?

169
00:09:18,984 --> 00:09:20,185
Hmm.

170
00:09:23,722 --> 00:09:24,790
[fortune cookie snaps]

171
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,493
"Find your own truth...

172
00:09:27,993 --> 00:09:30,994
6, 9, 25,

173
00:09:30,996 --> 00:09:34,900
18, 36, 41."

174
00:09:37,636 --> 00:09:39,536
Whoa. [mimics explosion]

175
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:43,006
This is why you're
the wisest doll in town.

176
00:09:43,008 --> 00:09:46,076
You're so right.
I have to believe in myself.

177
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:47,844
Uh... sure.

178
00:09:47,846 --> 00:09:50,647
So how do I do that?
Specifically?

179
00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:53,483
Uh, well,
a wiser doll than me would say

180
00:09:53,485 --> 00:09:55,519
you should stop listening
to what others tell you.

181
00:09:55,521 --> 00:09:58,555
But all I have
to offer you now is some...

182
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:00,357
Satisfaction Guaran-tea.

183
00:10:00,359 --> 00:10:04,227
Oh! You want to read
my tea leaves! Of course!

184
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:08,231
Um, you know,
reading tea leaves is not...

185
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,169
it's not really my thing.

186
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:14,905
But I can tell you that your
forehead looks nice and bright.

187
00:10:14,907 --> 00:10:16,606
And that's good luck.

188
00:10:16,608 --> 00:10:18,542
So take that good luck
and believe in yourself

189
00:10:18,544 --> 00:10:20,079
from the comfort
of your own home.

190
00:10:23,349 --> 00:10:24,583
What do you see?

191
00:10:25,084 --> 00:10:26,518
Uh...

192
00:10:27,186 --> 00:10:28,753
- You...
- "You"?

193
00:10:28,755 --> 00:10:30,389
Oh! You mean me.

194
00:10:30,856 --> 00:10:34,059
It's not what you see,
but what I see.

195
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,729
Hmm...

196
00:10:36,061 --> 00:10:38,931
I see leaves.

197
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:42,132
Leaves! I need to leave!

198
00:10:42,134 --> 00:10:44,868
All this time I've been
waiting for my kid to find me,

199
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,738
but I should find my kid!

200
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,139
Wait, what? That's not
what I was saying at all!

201
00:10:49,141 --> 00:10:53,076
Thank you so much, Lucky!
You're so wise. So wise!

202
00:10:53,078 --> 00:10:55,747
- Well, I'm just lucky...
- Come on!

203
00:10:55,749 --> 00:10:58,281
Moxy, I think you may have misinterpreted
the spirit of what I was trying to...

204
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:01,718
- [Moxy] Ugly Dog, let's go.
- Yeah! I know that look. Wait up!

205
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,220
[Lucky Bat]
Yes, let's wait up!

206
00:11:03,222 --> 00:11:05,489
Babo! Lucky Bat
has a great new idea.

207
00:11:05,491 --> 00:11:08,058
- No, no...
- We're gonna make our dreams come true!

208
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,993
I'm always geared up
for dreams.

209
00:11:09,995 --> 00:11:12,562
- [Lucky Bat] Or nightmares!
- [Moxy] Wage! Today's the day!

210
00:11:12,564 --> 00:11:14,064
But, Moxy!

211
00:11:14,066 --> 00:11:15,966
- Come on!
- [sighs] Here we go again.

212
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:18,101
[Lucky Bat] Can't we just
hit pause real quick?

213
00:11:18,103 --> 00:11:19,269
[sighs]

214
00:11:19,271 --> 00:11:20,971
Oh! Hello, Moxy.

215
00:11:20,973 --> 00:11:22,939
Looks like you're all
having a good time.

216
00:11:22,941 --> 00:11:25,942
Oh, loads of fun. Lucky Bat
made everything crystal clear.

217
00:11:25,944 --> 00:11:28,245
- Hey, Lucky! Attabat!
- [Lucky Bat squeals]

218
00:11:28,247 --> 00:11:30,249
[Moxy] We're gonna make
our dreams come true!

219
00:11:31,016 --> 00:11:34,351
Everything that comes
to Uglyville arrives here.

220
00:11:34,353 --> 00:11:36,754
So if we're going to find
the Big World,

221
00:11:36,756 --> 00:11:39,489
it's only logical
we start here.

222
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:44,762
Okay, the Big World
and children do not exist.

223
00:11:44,764 --> 00:11:48,833
I just wanna have a look inside
that flower. Who's with me?

224
00:11:48,835 --> 00:11:49,968
[Wage] Don't do it.

225
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:52,936
- I'm in!
- Me, too!

226
00:11:52,938 --> 00:11:54,339
- [Wage] Traitors.
- Eh?

227
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:00,110
Come on. Come on over here.

228
00:12:00,112 --> 00:12:01,813
Hit me.

229
00:12:01,815 --> 00:12:04,614
- Just a quick look.
- And then we'll turn back.

230
00:12:04,616 --> 00:12:06,952
Yes! You guys are the ugliest.

231
00:12:07,286 --> 00:12:09,889
Now the only question is:
how do we get up there?

232
00:12:10,289 --> 00:12:12,956
- [Babo laughs]
- [Wage, Lucky Bat yelp]

233
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,357
Hey!

234
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:15,862
Whoa!

235
00:12:19,298 --> 00:12:21,298
Eh, I got nothing.

236
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,033
Hmm. We need something

237
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:24,902
that could grip onto the edge
nice and tight.

238
00:12:24,904 --> 00:12:27,406
Even then, it would still need
to hold all our weight.

239
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,141
Huh?

240
00:12:29,675 --> 00:12:31,007
No, no. No.

241
00:12:31,009 --> 00:12:34,146
No!

242
00:12:36,415 --> 00:12:37,549
[grunts]

243
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:42,221
[groans]
Anytime now, guys. Let's go.

244
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:46,525
[gasps] Hmm.

245
00:12:48,594 --> 00:12:50,694
[all] Wow.

246
00:12:50,696 --> 00:12:53,731
[Wage]
Oh, good. A terrifying void.

247
00:12:53,733 --> 00:12:55,198
[Babo]
That's always a good sign.

248
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,266
[Ugly Dog]
This is what the inside

249
00:12:56,268 --> 00:12:57,567
of a flower looks like?

250
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:59,669
Yeah, dark and creepy.

251
00:12:59,671 --> 00:13:01,673
All right, that's it.
Let's go.

252
00:13:02,742 --> 00:13:04,942
[Babo] Anyone else going
to UglyDolls On Ice tonight?

253
00:13:04,944 --> 00:13:06,878
[Wage] Nah, I don't wanna miss

254
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,849
this week's episode of
<i>Uglyville's Got No Talent.</i>

255
00:13:12,384 --> 00:13:14,286
Moxy?

256
00:13:15,687 --> 00:13:18,088
Let's just call it a day, huh?

257
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:21,691
You guys,
this pipe goes somewhere.

258
00:13:21,693 --> 00:13:23,228
Say something to her.

259
00:13:24,196 --> 00:13:25,763
Um... [clears throat]

260
00:13:25,765 --> 00:13:30,235
Sometimes, the insides
of our dreams are hollow.

261
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:34,239
- Like this pipe, for example.
- [scoffs]

262
00:13:36,408 --> 00:13:37,777
Hollow, huh?

263
00:13:40,045 --> 00:13:41,979
I guess a girl can dream.

264
00:13:41,981 --> 00:13:44,483
We'll just go on back
like a bunch of go-on-backers.

265
00:13:44,817 --> 00:13:47,150
I just gotta see
what it's like!

266
00:13:47,152 --> 00:13:50,122
I think we probably should
have expected her to do that.

267
00:13:51,223 --> 00:13:53,123
- Here we go.
- [Wage] Moxy. Moxy!

268
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,926
Slow down. You're gonna slip.

269
00:13:54,928 --> 00:13:57,730
- It's dangerous!
- [panting]

270
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:02,934
[Moxy] Almost there! Come on!

271
00:14:02,936 --> 00:14:05,738
[continues panting]

272
00:14:07,673 --> 00:14:09,742
Come on, guys! Come on!

273
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:14,845
Um...

274
00:14:14,847 --> 00:14:15,982
I guess not.

275
00:14:16,615 --> 00:14:19,917
Guys. What if this is the way
to the Big World?

276
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:22,152
But Ox says there is
no Big World and he...

277
00:14:22,154 --> 00:14:26,656
He didn't know there was something
else out there. But we do.

278
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:30,928
This pipe? It's real,
and it has to lead somewhere.

279
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,429
Maybe it's the Big World.

280
00:14:32,431 --> 00:14:35,032
If anyone can figure it out,
it's us.

281
00:14:35,034 --> 00:14:39,369
Lucky, what could make you wiser than
solving the ultimate unsolved mystery?

282
00:14:39,371 --> 00:14:41,939
Hello! Mystery ahead!

283
00:14:41,941 --> 00:14:43,841
And, Ugly Dog,
you're my best friend.

284
00:14:43,843 --> 00:14:45,542
Well, that's just hurtful.

285
00:14:45,544 --> 00:14:48,445
Are you really going
to let me go in alone?

286
00:14:48,447 --> 00:14:49,981
You ain't goin' alone.

287
00:14:49,983 --> 00:14:51,147
[Wage] Classic guilt trip.

288
00:14:51,149 --> 00:14:52,515
And when someone needs help,

289
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:53,951
who y'all gonna call?

290
00:14:53,953 --> 00:14:56,152
Babo, that's who!

291
00:14:56,154 --> 00:14:58,722
I gotta say, she gets me.

292
00:14:58,724 --> 00:15:02,160
Hmm. I suppose a little
journey could be enlightening.

293
00:15:02,895 --> 00:15:04,127
This is ridiculous!

294
00:15:04,129 --> 00:15:05,362
Going into a creepy pipe

295
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:06,864
that spells certain doom?

296
00:15:06,866 --> 00:15:08,966
No. No, thank you!

297
00:15:08,968 --> 00:15:10,400
Wage.

298
00:15:10,402 --> 00:15:12,202
Go ahead.
Give me your big sell, Moxy.

299
00:15:12,204 --> 00:15:13,804
Tell me that I have to go.

300
00:15:13,806 --> 00:15:15,740
It's my duty as a doll
to be a friend.

301
00:15:15,742 --> 00:15:18,575
Tell me that deep down I want
to know what's over there, too.

302
00:15:18,577 --> 00:15:20,143
Come on. Give me the pitch!

303
00:15:20,145 --> 00:15:21,846
If you don't come,

304
00:15:21,848 --> 00:15:23,246
you're going to have
to climb down that cliff

305
00:15:23,248 --> 00:15:25,651
all by yourself.

306
00:15:26,886 --> 00:15:28,186
Good pitch.

307
00:15:28,587 --> 00:15:31,554
Let's just let the record show
that I am against this.

308
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:34,324
- [all cheer]
- Now, that's what I'm talking about, Wage.

309
00:15:34,326 --> 00:15:36,727
- [Babo straining]
- [Wage] Slow down, Blobby.

310
00:15:36,729 --> 00:15:38,865
- [Babo] It's Babo.
- [Wage] I know your name.

311
00:15:40,733 --> 00:15:42,699
[Moxy]
There are so many tunnels.

312
00:15:42,701 --> 00:15:44,501
[Ugly Dog] What
we really need is a light.

313
00:15:44,503 --> 00:15:46,202
[Babo] I have a flashlight!

314
00:15:46,204 --> 00:15:47,872
[Wage] So why have
we been walking in the dark

315
00:15:47,874 --> 00:15:49,506
for the last hour, then?

316
00:15:49,508 --> 00:15:51,174
[Babo]
I'm conserving the batteries

317
00:15:51,176 --> 00:15:53,144
until we really need it.

318
00:15:53,146 --> 00:15:55,079
[Wage] Good thinking. Let me
know when you come upon a time

319
00:15:55,081 --> 00:15:57,048
when you really need it.

320
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:58,417
[Babo] You got it!

321
00:15:59,685 --> 00:16:01,451
- [sniffing]
- You smell anything?

322
00:16:01,453 --> 00:16:02,686
It's hard to say.

323
00:16:02,688 --> 00:16:05,457
It'd be easier
if I had a nose.

324
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:07,925
[all scream]

325
00:16:07,927 --> 00:16:09,426
[Wage] Creepy falling babies!

326
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:11,428
Whoa! Creepy falling babies!

327
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,066
Oh, no! Oh, no.

328
00:16:13,398 --> 00:16:15,198
Huh? [gasp]

329
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,736
[Moxy laughs]

330
00:16:17,703 --> 00:16:21,573
- [laughing, cheering]
- Whoo! Yes!

331
00:16:23,308 --> 00:16:25,608
Hey, look at me go!

332
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,446
[laughs] Hello!

333
00:16:27,947 --> 00:16:29,379
I'm freakin' out.

334
00:16:29,381 --> 00:16:30,613
Breathe in deep.

335
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:33,951
- [inhales]
- Very calmly!

336
00:16:33,953 --> 00:16:36,122
[screams]

337
00:16:43,562 --> 00:16:46,262
And exhale.

338
00:16:46,264 --> 00:16:47,666

00:26:05,958 --> 00:26:07,157
Have you lost your mind?

504
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:08,625
We don't belong here.

505
00:26:08,627 --> 00:26:10,227
We've come this far.

506
00:26:10,229 --> 00:26:11,962
Um... come again?

507
00:26:11,964 --> 00:26:14,231
We're gonna train
and go to the Big World.

508
00:26:14,233 --> 00:26:16,700
We're just as lovable
as any of you.

509
00:26:16,702 --> 00:26:19,872
And we're gonna
prove you wrong.

510
00:26:27,012 --> 00:26:29,848
Before we decide to do this,
shouldn't we tell Ox?

511
00:26:32,718 --> 00:26:34,985
Ox? Who is Ox?

512
00:26:34,987 --> 00:26:37,823
Well, he's the founder and mayor
of our town, where we live.

513
00:26:38,657 --> 00:26:43,327
So there's
a whole town of Uglies?

514
00:26:43,329 --> 00:26:45,564
It's called Uglyville.

515
00:26:45,898 --> 00:26:48,165
I guess they're
into literal naming.

516
00:26:48,167 --> 00:26:50,033
None of this matters. Okay?

517
00:26:50,035 --> 00:26:54,071
Only Pretty Dolls can run
the Gauntlet. Rules are rules.

518
00:26:54,073 --> 00:26:55,274
What rules?

519
00:26:55,874 --> 00:26:58,175
- Uh...
- [robot] Did someone say "rules"?

520
00:26:58,177 --> 00:27:01,545
- It says right here in section 43...
- Oh! You know what? Stay here.

521
00:27:01,547 --> 00:27:03,213
- Seriously?
- [Lou] Yes.

522
00:27:03,215 --> 00:27:06,383
What kind of amazingly
benevolent leader would I be

523
00:27:06,385 --> 00:27:09,388
if I denied fellow dolls a
chance to fulfill their dreams?

524
00:27:09,855 --> 00:27:13,256
Mandy, show our special guests
their quarters.

525
00:27:13,258 --> 00:27:16,794
May I suggest
the Supply Suite.

526
00:27:16,796 --> 00:27:18,030
Sweet!

527
00:27:25,137 --> 00:27:29,441
I have a reputation to maintain,
so I let you skate by this time.

528
00:27:30,075 --> 00:27:31,910
Enjoy this moment.

529
00:27:32,478 --> 00:27:35,979
Because it doesn't
get better than this.

530
00:27:35,981 --> 00:27:38,550
[Babo] Ha!
That's the name of our song.

531
00:27:41,954 --> 00:27:44,254
Find out everything you can
about their town

532
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,956
and report back to me
tomorrow night.

533
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:49,128
- Night? Like a date?
- No.

534
00:27:49,428 --> 00:27:53,800
But there is one more thing
I need you to do.

535
00:27:57,102 --> 00:27:58,904
UglyDolls.

536
00:27:59,605 --> 00:28:02,141
<i>♪ I'll crush them all ♪</i>

537
00:28:02,674 --> 00:28:04,910
<i>♪ Destroy their dream ♪</i>

538
00:28:05,444 --> 00:28:10,582
<i>♪ To save my perfect empire
Nothing's too extreme ♪</i>

539
00:28:10,916 --> 00:28:12,983
<i>♪ And I know how to do it ♪</i>

540
00:28:12,985 --> 00:28:15,619
<i>♪ Without looking
Too uncouth ♪</i>

541
00:28:15,621 --> 00:28:18,989
<i>♪ A plan that's
So foul, gross ♪</i>

542
00:28:18,991 --> 00:28:21,960
<i>♪ Hideous, nasty ♪</i>

543
00:28:23,328 --> 00:28:26,698
<i>♪ They'll never see the ugly ♪</i>

544
00:28:27,834 --> 00:28:29,668
<i>♪ Truth ♪</i>

545
00:28:30,636 --> 00:28:33,703
[Moxy] We are definitely not
"Doll Type 12."

546
00:28:33,705 --> 00:28:36,673
- Everything is so different here.
- [Wage] I'd say.

547
00:28:36,675 --> 00:28:40,644
[Babo] So you guys
actually live in these boxes?

548
00:28:40,646 --> 00:28:43,013
Not that they're bad boxes.

549
00:28:43,015 --> 00:28:46,483
They're all neat and organized
and straight...

550
00:28:46,485 --> 00:28:49,655
and symmetrical
and clean and...

551
00:28:50,355 --> 00:28:51,490
Whew.

552
00:28:51,858 --> 00:28:53,457
I'm okay.

553
00:28:53,459 --> 00:28:54,826
[grunts]

554
00:28:54,828 --> 00:28:56,894
Silly tree. Oh, my goodness.

555
00:28:56,896 --> 00:28:59,364
Okay. This way, please.

556
00:29:02,568 --> 00:29:04,334
[Moxy] What is that?

557
00:29:04,336 --> 00:29:06,503
That would be the supply she...

558
00:29:06,505 --> 00:29:09,239
I mean suite.
Your home away from home.

559
00:29:09,241 --> 00:29:11,208
We are staying there?

560
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,578
[Moxy] I love it!

561
00:29:14,781 --> 00:29:18,048
- [Ugly Dog] Am I the only one seeing this?
- It's so industrial chic.

562
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:22,552
"Industrial chic"? It's a shed.
I mean, there's boxes and a mop.

563
00:29:22,554 --> 00:29:25,555
Dibs on the mop
and the bucket of dirty water.

564
00:29:25,557 --> 00:29:28,358
- Check out my spare tire.
- It matches my other tire.

565
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,594
- This place is perfect for us.
- Hey, hey, guys.

566
00:29:30,596 --> 00:29:32,028
I'm really glad
you like it and all.

567
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:34,199
But I didn't get your names.

568
00:29:34,934 --> 00:29:36,868
- Sorry. I'm Moxy.
- Babo.

569
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:38,502
- Lucky Bat.
- Wage.

570
00:29:38,504 --> 00:29:40,771
- Folks call me Ugly Dog.
- Because that's his name.

571
00:29:40,773 --> 00:29:44,174
- But those close to me call me Slick Dog.
- Which is not his name.

572
00:29:44,176 --> 00:29:46,443
Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.

573
00:29:46,445 --> 00:29:48,545
[exhales]

574
00:29:48,547 --> 00:29:51,548
So are you really here just
to train for the Big World?

575
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,717
- Yup.
- You bet!

576
00:29:53,719 --> 00:29:57,087
And we're all gonna end up with
our own special kid to love.

577
00:29:57,089 --> 00:30:00,925
You do know that Lou is gonna
make it super hard, right?

578
00:30:00,927 --> 00:30:03,393
Well, I say bring it on,
Louis.

579
00:30:03,395 --> 00:30:04,864
He means well, of course.

580
00:30:05,765 --> 00:30:08,733
- Though he can be a bit judgmental.
- Ya think?

581
00:30:08,735 --> 00:30:11,434
Still, without
his constructive criticism,

582
00:30:11,436 --> 00:30:13,738
none of us
would ever get anywhere.

583
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,238
So just stay on his good side.

584
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,908
[grunt] Ow!

585
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:19,609
Cool glasses.
I always wanted some specs.

586
00:30:19,611 --> 00:30:21,779
- Ooh, yeah! I feel smarter already!
- [Mandy] Excuse me!

587
00:30:21,781 --> 00:30:23,413
- No!
- Do I look wiser?

588
00:30:23,415 --> 00:30:26,251
- Oh, yeah!
- No! Please, just... Please!

589
00:30:26,485 --> 00:30:27,987
[all] Huh?

590
00:30:29,923 --> 00:30:31,323
We're sorry.

591
00:30:33,158 --> 00:30:34,794
Please don't say anything,
guys.

592
00:30:35,661 --> 00:30:37,229
Especially not to Lou.

593
00:30:37,596 --> 00:30:39,830
Lots of dolls
wear glasses in Uglyville.

594
00:30:39,832 --> 00:30:41,631
Even Five-Eyed Steve.

595
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:43,768
This is
the Institute of Perfection,

596
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:46,636
and Perfect Dolls
have perfect eyesight.

597
00:30:46,638 --> 00:30:48,574
- [grunt]
- [UglyDolls] Oh!

598
00:30:50,843 --> 00:30:53,412
Man, and I thought
I had issues.

599
00:30:53,846 --> 00:30:55,913
Do you feel
that electricity between us?

600
00:30:55,915 --> 00:30:57,815
Watch this.
She's gonna turn around.

601
00:30:57,817 --> 00:30:59,919
She's gonna turn around.

602
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:03,353
She's doing the old
"don't turn around" move.

603
00:31:03,355 --> 00:31:06,458
Well, she didn't need glasses
to see through you.

604
00:31:09,461 --> 00:31:10,662
Whoa!

605
00:31:15,802 --> 00:31:17,034
- Hey, Mandy!
- [screams]

606
00:31:17,036 --> 00:31:18,335
Sorry.

607
00:31:18,337 --> 00:31:19,806
I think your glasses
look special.

608
00:31:20,105 --> 00:31:21,707
They make you who you are.

609
00:31:22,541 --> 00:31:24,107
Yeah, but...

610
00:31:24,109 --> 00:31:25,477
No butts about it!

611
00:31:26,111 --> 00:31:27,344
[both giggle]

612
00:31:27,346 --> 00:31:28,781
[Moxy] See you tomorrow!

613
00:31:37,556 --> 00:31:39,456
[Kitty] Ugh.
Are you kidding me?

614
00:31:39,458 --> 00:31:41,058
[Lydia]
First that dark, greasy pipe,

615
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,692
and now we have
to go down there?

616
00:31:42,694 --> 00:31:44,494
Yeah, maybe someone
down there

617
00:31:44,496 --> 00:31:46,565
- can tell us where Uglyville is.
- [scoffs]

618
00:31:52,304 --> 00:31:54,306
[Tuesday]
Lowering, lowering, lowering.

619
00:31:54,673 --> 00:31:56,809
Creeping, creeping, creeping.

620
00:31:57,242 --> 00:31:58,675
Sneaking, sneaking...

621
00:31:58,677 --> 00:32:01,713
[Kitty] It's not sneaking
if you say it.

622
00:32:03,181 --> 00:32:04,316
Huh?

623
00:32:06,518 --> 00:32:07,653
Huh?

624
00:32:09,488 --> 00:32:10,857
Huh?

625
00:32:11,657 --> 00:32:12,825
[gasp]

626
00:32:13,726 --> 00:32:15,928
Evenin'. Lookin' ugly.

627
00:32:16,495 --> 00:32:18,898
- Check me. Am I ugly?
- Come on.

628
00:32:26,605 --> 00:32:30,076
[Tuesday] Rolling, rolling,
rolling, rolling, rolling.

629
00:32:30,709 --> 00:32:32,544
[Kitty] Gross!

630
00:32:35,247 --> 00:32:36,783
[faint cheering]

631
00:32:39,418 --> 00:32:42,887
Go, go, go! Come on, Willard.
I got a lot of buttons riding on you.

632
00:32:42,889 --> 00:32:44,789
Come on!
Do it for Five-Eyed Steve!

633
00:32:44,791 --> 00:32:47,925
This place is definitely ugly,
that's for sure.

634
00:32:47,927 --> 00:32:49,426
Hey, Tuesday, jot that down.

635
00:32:49,428 --> 00:32:51,428
Yas! Lou's gonna be like,

636
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:53,596
"You guys are
the awesome-est spies ever."

637
00:32:53,598 --> 00:32:56,133
And then he'll love me.

638
00:32:56,135 --> 00:32:59,904
And the winner is Wedgehead,
by a wedge.

639
00:32:59,906 --> 00:33:01,774
Thanks, Mayor Ox!

640
00:33:02,075 --> 00:33:03,774
[Tuesday]
Is that a bunny or something?

641
00:33:03,776 --> 00:33:06,643
Oh, I love bunnies.

642
00:33:06,645 --> 00:33:09,281
[sighs] No, that's Ox!

643
00:33:09,715 --> 00:33:12,118
And there he goes. Let's move!

644
00:33:14,453 --> 00:33:17,320
Get him into the bag, up the pipe,
and we're on our way back to Lou.

645
00:33:17,322 --> 00:33:20,557
- Easy-peasy. Any questions?
- Yes! As a matter of fact.

646
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:23,259
- Are those my earrings?
- Yes. Any more questions?

647
00:33:23,261 --> 00:33:25,628
How could you take them
without asking me?

648
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:27,566
It was super easy.

649
00:33:28,101 --> 00:33:31,938
Oh, no, no. Don't cry, Lydia.
It'll give you frown lines.

650
00:33:32,404 --> 00:33:34,404
Attagirl.
It's no big deal, right?

651
00:33:34,406 --> 00:33:36,943
I mean, it's not like
I borrowed your lip gloss.

652
00:33:37,977 --> 00:33:40,077
Wait, is that my lip gloss?

653
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:44,481
Whoa, is that the time? Getting late.
Let's do this. Synchronize!

654
00:33:44,483 --> 00:33:48,020
- That's my watch!
- It is, but it looks better on me.

655
00:33:48,286 --> 00:33:49,321
Come on.

656
00:33:50,123 --> 00:33:53,760
- [sighs] It does look good on her.
- I know, right?

657
00:33:55,327 --> 00:33:56,461
[gasps]

658
00:33:57,096 --> 00:33:58,296
Hmm...

659
00:34:03,301 --> 00:34:04,501
[yelps, grunts]

660
00:34:04,503 --> 00:34:06,669
Whoa! [grunts]

661
00:34:06,671 --> 00:34:08,806
Whoo!
Got the Ugly rabbit thing.

662
00:34:08,808 --> 00:34:10,273
Ow!

663
00:34:10,275 --> 00:34:12,209
[Ox] Oh, a little rabbit
in the sack, huh?

664
00:34:12,211 --> 00:34:13,345
[grunts]

665
00:34:14,147 --> 00:34:17,649
I'm a natural ear runner.
You'll never catch me...

666
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:20,683
[groans] Right in the buttons.

667
00:34:20,685 --> 00:34:23,122
- [grunts]
- [Lydia] Good thing for that random rake.

668
00:34:23,622 --> 00:34:25,655
Just like we planned it.

669
00:34:25,657 --> 00:34:27,994
Now tell us
where Uglyville is!

670
00:34:29,061 --> 00:34:30,795
[Lou]
Today you begin your training.

671
00:34:30,797 --> 00:34:32,362
And I know
that seems stressful,

672
00:34:32,364 --> 00:34:34,165
maybe a little scary.

673
00:34:34,167 --> 00:34:36,466
But remember: This is
your purpose as a doll.
