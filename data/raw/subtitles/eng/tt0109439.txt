1
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,361
Hi, Curly.

2
00:02:04,007 --> 00:02:05,497
Remember me?

3
00:02:05,975 --> 00:02:07,533
Mitch Robbins?

4
00:02:07,944 --> 00:02:10,174
I was on your last cattle drive.

5
00:02:10,446 --> 00:02:13,574
Remember? We birthed that calf together.

6
00:02:14,751 --> 00:02:16,013
How you been?

7
00:02:16,653 --> 00:02:20,145
I'm sorry.
That's a stupid thing to say, because...

8
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,291
Why get into that? Why depress you?

9
00:02:25,261 --> 00:02:26,694
Anyway...

10
00:02:27,764 --> 00:02:29,994
I think about you a lot.

11
00:02:30,633 --> 00:02:32,430
You changed my whole life.

12
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,227
You were right, cowboy.

13
00:02:36,306 --> 00:02:37,796
'"One thing.'"

14
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,236
'"Just one thing.'"

15
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,754
City folk.

16
00:03:01,998 --> 00:03:03,829
I buried him alive!

17
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:35,953
Hello?

18
00:05:07,991 --> 00:05:08,980
Yes!

19
00:06:09,385 --> 00:06:10,716
Hi, Mom.

20
00:06:11,854 --> 00:06:15,620
It's September 8, 1952.

21
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:19,954
We're driving back from Aunt Marsha's,
my water breaks...

22
00:06:20,029 --> 00:06:23,294
your father jumps the divider
of the Saw Mill River Parkway...

23
00:06:23,366 --> 00:06:25,857
and races me to Doctors' Hospital...

24
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:28,463
and at 5:16...

25
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:32,300
out you came.

26
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:35,871
Happy birthday, darling!

27
00:06:36,345 --> 00:06:39,337
I can't believe you're 40.

28
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,711
I'm overcome. Talk to your father.

29
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:47,979
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, boy. Happy birthday.

30
00:06:48,057 --> 00:06:49,456
Thanks. How are you?

31
00:06:49,525 --> 00:06:53,086
I got a cyst on my testicle.
Here's your mother.

32
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:55,153
Don't worry, he's fine.

33
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:58,494
So, how does it feel to be 40?

34
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,660
- Actually, Mom, I feel great.
- Why, what's wrong?

35
00:07:01,737 --> 00:07:04,831
Ma, he's fine. He's never been better.

36
00:07:06,109 --> 00:07:08,839
You're there, too? Hi, Barbara.

37
00:07:08,911 --> 00:07:11,038
Well, listen, you two, have a...

38
00:07:11,114 --> 00:07:14,277
Leo, Leo! The dog needs to go out.

39
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,682
Leo! He's impossible.

40
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,617
- I'm gonna have him neutered.
- She means the dog.

41
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,054
Stop that!

42
00:07:21,124 --> 00:07:23,615
I've got to go, he's peeing on the carpet!

43
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,251
She means Dad.

44
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,725
'Bye, Mom.

45
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:32,859
'Bye, angel birthday boy.

46
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:34,959
'Bye.

47
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,871
- Happy birthday, honey.
- Thanks.

48
00:07:40,977 --> 00:07:42,842
Oh, boy!

49
00:07:43,412 --> 00:07:46,074
- What a nightmare.
- They're your parents.

50
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,712
No, not them.
I had a nightmare that was...

51
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:53,150
I don't want to talk about it...

52
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:56,350
because today is my birthday.

53
00:07:56,425 --> 00:07:58,325
The big 4-0.

54
00:07:59,962 --> 00:08:02,396
And I feel good, I really feel great.

55
00:08:02,965 --> 00:08:05,229
I feel good, yes.

56
00:08:05,768 --> 00:08:10,705
Nurse, today is my birthday.
I'd like to look at the ocean, please.

57
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,998
Thank you.

58
00:08:13,176 --> 00:08:16,509
I'm 40. And you know what?
It's not so terrible.

59
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,912
There's no surprise party, right?
Please, no surprise party?

60
00:08:19,982 --> 00:08:23,748
Abe's wife threw a surprise party,
he walked in, they yelled, '"Surprise! '"...

61
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:26,788
and he said, '"Bigger surprise:
I'm having a heart attack! '"

62
00:08:26,856 --> 00:08:29,689
Abe Goodman weighed 400 pounds.

63
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,920
Who are you telling, I was a pallbearer.

64
00:08:32,195 --> 00:08:34,425
I had to help carry that camper
he was buried in.

65
00:08:34,497 --> 00:08:35,964
No surprise party.

66
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:39,166
Just dinner and the movies,
you, me, and the kids...

67
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:42,927
then both the kids
are going to sleep over at my sister's.

68
00:08:43,806 --> 00:08:48,470
And you and I will have
the whole house to ourselves.

69
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:51,008
All night long.

70
00:08:51,347 --> 00:08:53,110
That's my present to you.

71
00:08:59,989 --> 00:09:01,718
Can I open my present now?

72
00:09:02,925 --> 00:09:04,051
Tonight.

73
00:09:08,364 --> 00:09:11,458
But, look, the little man
wants to go to the parade.

74
00:09:12,335 --> 00:09:14,166
Save your strength.

75
00:09:14,403 --> 00:09:15,961
You'll need it.

76
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,535
I love it up here.

77
00:09:19,175 --> 00:09:21,405
I'm so glad we moved out of the city.

78
00:09:21,544 --> 00:09:23,876
- 'Morning!
- Good morning!

79
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,308
Work is good.

80
00:09:26,716 --> 00:09:28,581
I'm just not pushing time anymore.

81
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,846
I'm the boss now and I like it.

82
00:09:30,953 --> 00:09:32,545
- 'Morning!
- 'Morning!

83
00:09:35,224 --> 00:09:38,125
Want to turn back? Come on, let's go.

84
00:09:38,227 --> 00:09:42,664
How will you get into a bathing suit?
Look at you, you weigh 800 pounds.

85
00:09:43,065 --> 00:09:45,260
And don't tell me ThighMaster.

86
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:48,269
You're so out of shape.
I'm 40 and you're 1.

87
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:50,032
Look at you.

88
00:09:50,106 --> 00:09:52,597
You're like this
big tub of veal or something.

89
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:56,008
Stay in your lane. Why bump me, Norman?
I saved your life.

90
00:09:56,312 --> 00:09:58,906
If it wasn't for me, you'd be 100 wallets.

91
00:10:28,411 --> 00:10:29,810
Okay, we're back.

92
00:10:30,012 --> 00:10:33,641
I'm Dr. Jeffrey Sanborn.
Emotional pain is as real as physical pain.

93
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:37,015
Just 'cause you can't see a wound
on an X-ray doesn't mean it isn't there.

94
00:10:37,086 --> 00:10:39,020
Remember, I feel your pain.

95
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:42,918
If you want to talk to me about anything,
call 555-HELP.

96
00:10:43,292 --> 00:10:46,125
We're on the phone now
with Kenny from New Jersey.

97
00:10:46,662 --> 00:10:50,189
- Kenny? Thanks for waiting.
- That's all right.

98
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:54,166
Kenny, you said
you get extremely depressed at night.

99
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:57,467
That's when the clothes in my closet
come alive.

100
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:58,999
Excuse me?

101
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:01,301
Well, not really, it's...

102
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:04,102
Nighttime's when I'm alone
and my mind...

103
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,670
I understand.

104
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:08,649
I pretend there are friends
who come over...

105
00:11:08,718 --> 00:11:10,845
Are these men's or women's clothes?

106
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,083
No, I don't have women's clothes.
They're men's clothes.

107
00:11:14,156 --> 00:11:15,316
None at all?

108
00:11:15,658 --> 00:11:18,388
Hi. Don't forget.
The sales meeting's in 10 minutes.

109
00:11:18,461 --> 00:11:20,691
I want to talk to you about Phil.

110
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,755
Nobody said anything
when you gave your friend your old job...

111
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:26,199
though he had no experience
in radio or sales...

112
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:28,202
- I know.
...because you're the boss.

113
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:31,205
But you said
you'd let him go two months ago.

114
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:32,706
I know.

115
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:36,142
- He's costing the station money.
- It takes a while.

116
00:11:36,545 --> 00:11:39,446
He's in his office now. He's trying his best.

117
00:11:42,718 --> 00:11:45,881
He's been through a tough time.
He's being cleaned out in his divorce.

118
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,115
He's just down.

119
00:11:47,189 --> 00:11:50,716
Then why are you taking him
to the Las Vegas convention?

120
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:55,321
They'll charge you for excess baggage.
You can't keep putting this off.

121
00:11:55,398 --> 00:11:59,391
Lois, today is my birthday.
Do you know what your present to me is?

122
00:11:59,535 --> 00:12:01,696
Not to talk about this anymore?

123
00:12:01,771 --> 00:12:03,932
Thank you, it's just what I wanted.

124
00:12:09,712 --> 00:12:12,044
We're back with Kenny from New Jersey.

125
00:12:12,214 --> 00:12:16,480
The women you meet, do they say things
to make you feel they don't like you?

126
00:12:16,552 --> 00:12:19,715
It's not anything that they say, it's just...

127
00:12:20,055 --> 00:12:22,523
an overall feeling I get that they're...

128
00:12:24,427 --> 00:12:26,418
What do you get?

129
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:29,259
Are you there, Kenny?

130
00:12:30,599 --> 00:12:32,294
Are you all right?

131
00:12:32,368 --> 00:12:34,893
Are the clothes in your closet
coming to life?

132
00:12:38,774 --> 00:12:40,765
- What's happening?
- Wrong number.

133
00:12:41,243 --> 00:12:42,505
Speak to me.

134
00:12:42,778 --> 00:12:45,770
Kenny has to go.
He's cooking breakfast for his underwear.

135
00:12:46,048 --> 00:12:48,539
- Who is this?
- I'm a pair of his socks.

136
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,785
You're calling the station psychiatrist
instead of working?

137
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:59,057
Well, it's free.
Do you know what psychiatry costs?

138
00:12:59,328 --> 00:13:01,762
Anyway, this guy is helping me.

139
00:13:01,964 --> 00:13:03,556
Helping you?

140
00:13:03,632 --> 00:13:06,829
Last year this guy was doing
our traffic reports from a helicopter.

141
00:13:06,902 --> 00:13:09,803
If this doesn't work,
he's going to be the movie critic.

142
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,568
What's going on?
You were doing so much better.

143
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,308
I'm thinking of going back with Arlene.

144
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:18,778
Are you serious?

145
00:13:18,848 --> 00:13:21,373
I'm not sure she'd take me back,
but maybe...

146
00:13:21,584 --> 00:13:23,347
Think about what you're saying.

147
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:26,650
Going back to Arlene
is like breaking back into Alcatraz.

148
00:13:26,922 --> 00:13:28,617
You were miserable with Arlene.

149
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,955
Yeah, but I wasn't lonely.

150
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:38,066
Come home with me tonight.
It's my birthday, we're going out.

151
00:13:38,133 --> 00:13:40,567
- I forgot your birthday!
- Don't worry about it.

152
00:13:40,636 --> 00:13:43,230
Just come with me.
But you can't sleep over...

153
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:45,468
because Barbara and I...

154
00:13:46,108 --> 00:13:47,666
- You can't.
- That's okay.

155
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:50,837
Then this weekend we're going to Vegas.
That'll be fun.

156
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,416
Oh, boy, we got a big meeting,
so come on.

157
00:13:59,321 --> 00:14:03,655
Thank God I've got this job
to go to every day or I'd really go crazy.

158
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,629
- Good morning, everybody.
- Good morning.

159
00:14:09,698 --> 00:14:12,360
What's with the champagne?
What are we celebrating?

160
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,095
We're celebrating two things.

161
00:14:14,169 --> 00:14:17,070
First, today happens to be
my 40th birthday.

162
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:23,105
Secondly, and maybe more importantly,
in a minute George Leyton will call...

163
00:14:23,178 --> 00:14:26,409
to inform us officially that we are
the new New York affiliate...

164
00:14:26,482 --> 00:14:28,279
for the Jerry Jackson Show!

165
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,944
- That show's a gold mine!
- Sure is.

166
00:14:33,022 --> 00:14:35,422
Naturally, I had to clear
the 6:00 to 10:00 slots.

167
00:14:35,491 --> 00:14:38,722
We're talking scheduling changes,
marketing, promotion and sales.

168
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,056
This is great for our station!

169
00:14:42,331 --> 00:14:44,424
- Call for Mitch, line 1.
- Put it through.

170
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,229
This must be the call.

171
00:14:46,368 --> 00:14:49,633
Put it on the speaker,
I want to share this with everybody.

172
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,041
'Morning. You have good news for me?

173
00:14:54,109 --> 00:14:56,839
Tonight, I will pull down your pants...

174
00:14:56,912 --> 00:15:00,040
sink my hands into your cute little ass...

175
00:15:00,115 --> 00:15:02,174
and give you a tongue bath.

176
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:06,477
I'm going to start at your feet
and slowly work my way up...

177
00:15:07,056 --> 00:15:08,045
Hello?

178
00:15:14,063 --> 00:15:15,826
New Rochelle.

179
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:18,289
Phil, we're here.

180
00:15:19,034 --> 00:15:20,194
We're here.

181
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,071
- Look, come here!
- I'm up.

182
00:15:35,417 --> 00:15:36,406
What?

183
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:40,510
Nothing.

184
00:15:44,793 --> 00:15:46,852
Excuse me. Coming through.

185
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,031
Curly!

186
00:15:58,707 --> 00:15:59,969
I'm sorry...

187
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,378
Who was that?

188
00:16:06,682 --> 00:16:09,082
I thought it was somebody else.

189
00:16:10,586 --> 00:16:13,248
Come on, it's your birthday. Let's go.

190
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,396
- What if he was a narcoleptic?
- Who?

191
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,228
Curly.

192
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,139
Curly? The trail boss?

193
00:16:37,046 --> 00:16:41,005
They go into these trances
where it looks like they're dead, but...

194
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,745
- they're not.
- He was dead. We checked.

195
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:45,411
He was...

196
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,284
Why are you even thinking about this?

197
00:16:51,226 --> 00:16:53,456
I thought I just saw Curly on the train.

198
00:16:54,163 --> 00:16:56,154
That's who I was chasing after.

199
00:16:56,832 --> 00:16:58,265
Yeah, right.

200
00:16:58,701 --> 00:17:02,034
We buried him alive.
He was underground for a year...

201
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,038
got up, dusted himself off...

202
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,870
and got on the commuter train
to New Rochelle.

203
00:17:07,009 --> 00:17:08,670
That makes sense.

204
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,510
You're right.

205
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,571
I must just be tired, that's all.

206
00:17:25,861 --> 00:17:27,351
Honey, I'm home.

207
00:17:27,496 --> 00:17:29,396
Guess who's coming to dinner?

208
00:17:30,532 --> 00:17:32,796
So you knew he was coming?

209
00:17:32,868 --> 00:17:35,098
- Yeah, I invited him.
- How could you do that?

210
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,297
- What are you saying?
- I'll leave.

211
00:17:37,372 --> 00:17:39,237
You know I can't stand him.

212
00:17:39,441 --> 00:17:43,138
- Oh, my God.
- Honey, this is Phil, our friend.

213
00:17:44,113 --> 00:17:46,547
I'm not talking about Phil.

214
00:17:50,452 --> 00:17:52,215
You thought I meant Phil?

215
00:17:52,755 --> 00:17:53,744
No, Phil.

216
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:57,956
I love you.

217
00:17:58,193 --> 00:18:00,184
Then what are we talking about?

218
00:18:01,463 --> 00:18:03,556
- Then you don't know.
- No, I don't.

219
00:18:03,632 --> 00:18:05,122
Can I buy a vowel?

220
00:18:05,267 --> 00:18:08,293
- Your brother's here.
- Oh, no.

221
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:11,132
Glen? Crazy Glen?

222
00:18:11,373 --> 00:18:12,931
What do you mean, he's here?

223
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,067
What do I mean? He's here!

224
00:18:15,144 --> 00:18:18,272
He's in our den,
watching a Spanish soap opera.

225
00:18:18,981 --> 00:18:20,778
How is he? How did he seem?

226
00:18:21,383 --> 00:18:24,716
He came in and asked me
to make him a sandwich, no crust...

227
00:18:24,787 --> 00:18:27,551
then started making long distance calls.

228
00:18:27,623 --> 00:18:28,715
Oh, God.

229
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:31,954
First, he did three scenes
from Godfather II.

230
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,886
He still does that? I love that.

231
00:18:36,165 --> 00:18:39,498
I'm warning you.
If you mention The Godfather to him...

232
00:18:39,568 --> 00:18:42,366
I'll rip your arms out
and beat you to death with them.

233
00:18:42,437 --> 00:18:44,337
This started as a good birthday.

234
00:18:44,406 --> 00:18:48,672
- What's he been up to?
- Nothing. He's the vice president of Lazy.

235
00:18:48,744 --> 00:18:51,042
He goes from one family member
to another...

236
00:18:51,113 --> 00:18:53,240
stays there until they throw him out.

237
00:18:53,315 --> 00:18:54,942
He borrows money.

238
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,380
Borrows indicates an intent to repay.

239
00:18:57,452 --> 00:18:59,249
He gets jobs that aren't jobs.

240
00:18:59,321 --> 00:19:02,552
We only hear from him through
change of address cards. He's lost.

241
00:19:02,624 --> 00:19:06,993
He's a lost soul, he's a dented can...
He's behind me, isn't he?

242
00:19:09,531 --> 00:19:10,828
Buenos dias.

243
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,298
Hello, Glen.

244
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,562
- How was your sandwich?
- Delightful.

245
00:19:15,304 --> 00:19:17,135
I'm sorry about what I said.

246
00:19:17,372 --> 00:19:19,567
Water off a duck's back. Come here.

247
00:19:21,376 --> 00:19:24,470
Look at you, you're still
the world's smallest big brother.

248
00:19:24,546 --> 00:19:25,911
- Hey, Glen.
- Phil.

249
00:19:25,981 --> 00:19:28,347
Long time no see. How are you?

250
00:19:29,117 --> 00:19:31,881
I'm getting divorced, I'm living alone...

251
00:19:32,054 --> 00:19:34,045
struggling for a reason to live.

252
00:19:36,325 --> 00:19:38,486
Too much information for me.

253
00:19:39,361 --> 00:19:42,091
I cannot get over this place.
I mean, look at it.

254
00:19:42,898 --> 00:19:47,164
You got birds and trees, and you got
those fish and you got a cow...

255
00:19:48,203 --> 00:19:49,727
By the way...

256
00:19:49,805 --> 00:19:52,467
- there is something wrong with your cow.
- What?

257
00:19:53,408 --> 00:19:57,310
I thought I'd help out with the chores,
you know, so I figured...

258
00:19:57,646 --> 00:19:58,806
milk the cow.

259
00:19:58,881 --> 00:20:02,612
I reach under there
and I'm pulling and tugging.

260
00:20:02,751 --> 00:20:04,241
Nothing, not a drop.

261
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:08,187
The cow's name is Norman.
You were pulling on his dick.

262
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:12,488
I'm gonna go wash up.

263
00:20:15,163 --> 00:20:16,960
Let me ask you a question:

264
00:20:17,532 --> 00:20:19,659
Who had Frankie Pentangeli killed?

265
00:20:24,172 --> 00:20:26,299
The Rosato Brothers.

266
00:20:27,209 --> 00:20:28,733
Who gave the order?

267
00:20:29,945 --> 00:20:31,412
I love this.

268
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,638
There was this kid...

269
00:20:33,949 --> 00:20:35,348
I grew up with.

270
00:20:35,617 --> 00:20:38,415
He was younger than me, looked up to me.

271
00:20:39,087 --> 00:20:41,078
We did our first work together.

272
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:45,259
Worked our way up the streets. Things
were good. We made the most of it.

273
00:20:45,961 --> 00:20:47,292
I got to change.

274
00:20:47,362 --> 00:20:50,593
During prohibition,
we ran molasses into Canada.

275
00:20:50,766 --> 00:20:52,165
Made a fortune.

276
00:20:52,234 --> 00:20:55,499
Ran molasses to Canada.
You should run brains to your head.

277
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,065
I can't believe you two
are from the same gene pool.

278
00:21:01,143 --> 00:21:03,805
- He's from the shallow end.
- When's he leaving?

279
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:05,842
I'll talk to him tonight.

280
00:21:05,981 --> 00:21:07,676
Hi, Dad. Happy birthday.

281
00:21:07,816 --> 00:21:11,684
- Thanks, Holly. Did you see your uncle?
- He borrowed $10 from me.

282
00:21:11,753 --> 00:21:14,688
- Have you seen your brother?
- He's hiding from Uncle Glen.

283
00:21:14,756 --> 00:21:17,725
Find him and tell him
we're leaving in a few minutes.

284
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,086
Who's that?

285
00:21:19,328 --> 00:21:21,626
It's Curtis. I invited him to come with us.

286
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,756
- Curtis? The lab experiment?
- Dad!

287
00:21:25,767 --> 00:21:30,227
I know you like him, but it's my birthday
and I wanted this to be a family thing.

288
00:21:30,305 --> 00:21:33,103
- Mom!
- Answer the door.

289
00:21:38,981 --> 00:21:40,778
I don't trust this Curtis.

290
00:21:40,849 --> 00:21:43,682
He's got eight million earrings,
his nose is pierced...

291
00:21:43,752 --> 00:21:45,447
He's no boy, he's a fishing lure.

292
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:48,545
This is the business we've chosen...

293
00:21:49,591 --> 00:21:51,149
What do we do about him?

294
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:55,959
We were supposed to be alone tonight.
I was planning to make noise.

295
00:21:57,432 --> 00:22:00,765
I'll send him home with Phil. It's perfect!

296
00:22:01,303 --> 00:22:03,533
Tonight is our night.

297
00:22:04,639 --> 00:22:07,199
Tonight, I'm the Energizer Bunny.

298
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:11,736
Someone put a bullet through his eye.

299
00:22:18,387 --> 00:22:20,480
Are you relaxed now?

300
00:22:29,364 --> 00:22:30,763
It's time.

301
00:22:33,001 --> 00:22:35,902
- I'm going to change.
- Change?

302
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,001
Into what?

303
00:22:44,746 --> 00:22:46,680
Your husband's out of town?

304
00:22:46,848 --> 00:22:48,509
- What?
- Nothing.

305
00:22:49,484 --> 00:22:51,645
It's just something that helps me.

306
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,535
I'm Antonio, dance with me.

307
00:23:11,106 --> 00:23:12,869
Oh, baby.

308
00:23:19,614 --> 00:23:22,105
I look like a schmuck.

309
00:23:47,776 --> 00:23:49,266
What's this?

310
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,423
What did you have in your hat, Curly?

311
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:27,213
What the hell is this?

312
00:24:29,818 --> 00:24:32,309
'"$1,000,000 in gold.

313
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:35,049
'"I took it, you find it.'"

314
00:24:35,757 --> 00:24:37,190
- What the...
- Mitch!

315
00:24:39,794 --> 00:24:42,126
- I'm ready.
- Just a second.

316
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,213
Happy birthday.

317
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:02,238
Wow.

318
00:25:03,718 --> 00:25:05,743
If I scream too loud...

319
00:25:06,555 --> 00:25:07,783
tough.

320
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:34,874
I'm done.

321
00:25:37,485 --> 00:25:38,975
What happened?

322
00:25:39,487 --> 00:25:43,651
- I just...
- There was, I think, too much anticipation.

323
00:25:43,992 --> 00:25:46,358
You know, and you look so great.

324
00:25:46,761 --> 00:25:50,993
And the kissing was great,
really wonderful, topnotch kissing, and...

325
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:54,124
it's better this way.

326
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:57,399
For whom?

327
00:25:57,772 --> 00:26:00,707
You. I mean, for us, I mean...

328
00:26:01,776 --> 00:26:03,641
because now...

329
00:26:06,581 --> 00:26:11,075
that one's out of the way, and
in 10 minutes the new shift comes on...

330
00:26:11,453 --> 00:26:13,785
and I'll be in total control.

331
00:26:14,189 --> 00:26:17,590
So, go hide in any room in the house
and I'll go look for you.

332
00:26:18,727 --> 00:26:21,321
- What?
- Go. It'll be great.

333
00:26:23,865 --> 00:26:25,730
Any room in the house.

334
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,198
I guess I got you too excited.

335
00:26:29,437 --> 00:26:30,699
Go hide.

336
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:39,639
I'm hiding.

337
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,044
I don't believe this!

338
00:26:43,151 --> 00:26:44,778
- Mitch?
- Okay.

339
00:27:02,404 --> 00:27:04,031
I feel your pain.

340
00:27:04,105 --> 00:27:07,563
Tell me again. Last year
you buried someone you were fond of?

341
00:27:08,476 --> 00:27:12,207
Someone I was very fond of.
With whom I had a very good relationship.

342
00:27:12,514 --> 00:27:15,449
But now this dead individual
seems to be following me.

343
00:27:15,517 --> 00:27:18,111
- Excuse me?
- I am plotzing, I am seeing him...

344
00:27:18,186 --> 00:27:19,915
You listening to this nut?

345
00:27:21,489 --> 00:27:22,649
He's crazy.

346
00:27:22,757 --> 00:27:25,487
- Are you seeing him now?
- Gotta go.

347
00:27:26,261 --> 00:27:28,161
- 'Morning.
- Are you busy?

348
00:27:28,697 --> 00:27:31,666
Actually, could I talk to you for a second?

349
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,056
What?

350
00:27:33,134 --> 00:27:34,863
You know what, forget about it.

351
00:27:34,936 --> 00:27:37,632
I love to hear about
other people's problems.

352
00:27:37,706 --> 00:27:39,503
Makes me feel normal.

353
00:27:41,142 --> 00:27:44,236
I know that this will sound crazy, but...

354
00:27:44,312 --> 00:27:45,802
I saw him again.

355
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,007
- Who?
- Curly.

356
00:27:49,217 --> 00:27:50,445
Oh, God, Mitch.

357
00:27:50,518 --> 00:27:54,750
Last night in the rain, outside my window.
I ran out, but he was gone.

358
00:27:54,956 --> 00:27:57,186
I'm telling you, we buried him alive.

359
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:59,988
He is pissed, and he wants his hat back.

360
00:28:01,696 --> 00:28:04,290
- I'm taking you home.
- No, let me explain.

361
00:28:04,366 --> 00:28:06,857
Nobody returns from the dead
for their hat.

362
00:28:07,135 --> 00:28:09,831
- Lf this was in it?
- This was in Curly's hat?

363
00:28:09,904 --> 00:28:11,872
It was sewn in the hat band.

364
00:28:12,841 --> 00:28:14,172
Read this.

365
00:28:14,409 --> 00:28:17,105
'"West Pac, eat my dust.
I took it, you find it.

366
00:28:17,178 --> 00:28:20,807
'"$1,000,000. L. Washburn.'"
Who's L. Washburn?

367
00:28:20,882 --> 00:28:22,782
- No idea.
- What is this?

368
00:28:23,151 --> 00:28:24,914
I think it's a treasure map.

369
00:28:24,986 --> 00:28:27,181
- No kidding?
- I'm not imagining this, right?

370
00:28:27,255 --> 00:28:28,950
There's a piece missing.

371
00:28:29,023 --> 00:28:31,753
But it shows the trail
and the X where it's buried.

372
00:28:31,826 --> 00:28:35,922
$1,000,000! I got those Time-Life books
on the Old West...

373
00:28:35,997 --> 00:28:39,831
and I read there's money buried all over
that's never been found.

374
00:28:40,068 --> 00:28:42,901
I bet this map tells you where it's buried.

375
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,371
Tells you where what's buried?

376
00:28:47,075 --> 00:28:48,804
Phil's grandmother.

377
00:28:52,781 --> 00:28:55,011
What's up? We're really busy.

378
00:28:56,785 --> 00:28:59,948
I'm going to do
a little more research on this...

379
00:29:01,589 --> 00:29:02,954
Grandma.

380
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:07,351
Wow, this is a big office.

381
00:29:08,263 --> 00:29:09,924
It's not that big.

382
00:29:11,065 --> 00:29:13,465
'"Mitch Robbins, Station Manager.'"

383
00:29:14,269 --> 00:29:17,568
- What is it? I'm a little bit busy.
- Nothing.

384
00:29:17,639 --> 00:29:20,574
That's great you got Phil a job.
That's really nice.

385
00:29:20,642 --> 00:29:23,543
- What's it been, about five months now?
- Yeah.

386
00:29:25,713 --> 00:29:30,173
I called you about six months ago,
and asked if there were any openings...

387
00:29:30,618 --> 00:29:34,145
and you said there wasn't anything.
Then a month goes by...

388
00:29:34,589 --> 00:29:37,319
something opens up, and Phil gets it.

389
00:29:39,727 --> 00:29:42,218
My tough luck, I guess. Or bad timing.

390
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:46,999
I always try to take care of you.

391
00:29:47,735 --> 00:29:49,635
Take care of me?

392
00:29:50,004 --> 00:29:53,098
Mikey, you're my kid brother,
and you take care of me?

393
00:29:53,842 --> 00:29:56,470
You're my kid brother.
My name is not Mikey.

394
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:59,206
Send Fredo to do this,
send Fredo to do that.

395
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,474
- I'm smart.
- Stop.

396
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:02,607
I'm smart, I want respect!

397
00:30:02,684 --> 00:30:05,152
Would you stop with this Godfather stuff!

398
00:30:05,753 --> 00:30:08,347
You want to talk about this? Seriously?

399
00:30:10,625 --> 00:30:13,389
'Cause you have a job for a friend
and not for a brother.

400
00:30:13,795 --> 00:30:16,025
And don't tell me he's special, all right?

401
00:30:16,097 --> 00:30:18,861
I like Phil, but let's face it...

402
00:30:18,933 --> 00:30:21,834
he's a lamb chop short of a mixed grill.

403
00:30:22,103 --> 00:30:23,331
So when you say...

404
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:25,998
I'll tell you something, and I'll be honest.

405
00:30:26,474 --> 00:30:30,205
I didn't want you to work here
because I can't count on you.

406
00:30:33,548 --> 00:30:37,678
I have tried to help you in the past
and you embarrassed me, frankly.

407
00:30:37,952 --> 00:30:40,750
- When?
- When? The ad agency thing?

408
00:30:40,955 --> 00:30:44,789
Bob Richardson gave you that job
as a personal favor to me.

409
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,723
And you let him down.

410
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:51,554
Bob Richardson said terrible things
about you behind your back.

411
00:30:51,833 --> 00:30:53,733
I had a fight with him.

412
00:30:53,868 --> 00:30:58,066
I said I don't care who he is,
he can't talk about my brother like that.

413
00:30:58,139 --> 00:31:00,403
And I refused to work there anymore.

414
00:31:01,576 --> 00:31:03,544
He told me you never showed up.

415
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,083
Oh, that Bob Richardson.

416
00:31:09,417 --> 00:31:10,816
That guy. He...

417
00:31:18,726 --> 00:31:21,957
I'll just deal with the fact
that my brother thinks I'm an idiot.

418
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:25,557
Don't turn this into an opera.
I don't think you're an idiot.

419
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:29,291
No? Never once in your life
did you ever say you were proud of me.

420
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,400
For what?

421
00:31:32,173 --> 00:31:33,162
Thanks.

422
00:31:37,111 --> 00:31:38,100
Damn it!

423
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,871
Glen, wait a second. Come here.

424
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:45,215
- Glen, come here.
- Let go of me, you big bully.

425
00:31:45,286 --> 00:31:48,221
Come here! Listen to me. I'm sorry...

426
00:31:48,389 --> 00:31:49,856
but you set me up for that.

427
00:31:50,458 --> 00:31:52,323
You've a right to feel how you feel.

428
00:31:53,194 --> 00:31:55,424
Would you please listen to me?

429
00:31:56,397 --> 00:31:59,423
Friday, I'm going to Las Vegas.

430
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,229
There's a big convention.

431
00:32:01,302 --> 00:32:03,202
Why don't you come with me and Phil?

432
00:32:03,271 --> 00:32:05,899
I'll introduce you,
you'll meet people, make contacts.

433
00:32:05,974 --> 00:32:07,703
Maybe something'll come of it...

434
00:32:07,775 --> 00:32:10,403
if you're really looking for a serious job.

435
00:32:10,912 --> 00:32:13,904
- Okay?
- Hey, Mitch. Come on. I found some...

436
00:32:14,282 --> 00:32:15,510
Grandma.

437
00:32:16,117 --> 00:32:17,277
Can you loan me $10?

438
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:23,317
And then it just hit me.
West Pac: Western Pacific Railroad.

439
00:32:23,391 --> 00:32:26,758
I'll bet you that $1,000,000
is from a train robbery.

440
00:32:26,828 --> 00:32:29,296
$1,000,000!

441
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:32,731
A little louder, some of the crack dealers
didn't hear you. Thank you.

442
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,763
Get you a little decaf.

443
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:56,648
I got it!

444
00:33:00,028 --> 00:33:01,495
Look at this.

445
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:04,557
'"June 12, 1908.'"

446
00:33:04,766 --> 00:33:06,597
That's what it says on the map!

447
00:33:06,668 --> 00:33:09,796
What could Curly have to do with this?
In 1908 he wasn't born yet.

448
00:33:09,871 --> 00:33:13,363
Look at this.
The starting spot on the map, Spencer...

449
00:33:13,441 --> 00:33:16,968
it's only 65 miles from Las Vegas.

450
00:33:17,311 --> 00:33:18,972
This is fate!

451
00:33:19,113 --> 00:33:20,375
Up yours.

452
00:33:21,382 --> 00:33:23,646
'"$1,000,000 in gold bars lost.'"

453
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:27,653
That was then.
Gold is 10 times more valuable now.

454
00:33:27,722 --> 00:33:29,019
Twenty!

455
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,489
$20,000,000!

456
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:34,560
Sorry. What am I doing?
I'm getting crazy! This is ridiculous.

457
00:33:34,629 --> 00:33:37,598
It's not crazy.
It's all fitting into place. Look.

458
00:33:37,665 --> 00:33:40,156
I got the trial of the train robbers.

459
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:45,235
'"Leader of the gang, Lincoln Washburn... '"

460
00:33:46,007 --> 00:33:48,373
- L. Washburn!
- I don't believe this.

461
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:52,641
'"...challenged the authorities.
'I took it, you find it', he said.

462
00:33:53,247 --> 00:33:56,239
'"So far, none of the gold
has been recovered.'"

463
00:33:56,651 --> 00:33:59,176
None of the gold has been recovered.

464
00:34:01,756 --> 00:34:03,314
- Let's do it.
- Do what?

465
00:34:03,391 --> 00:34:05,552
- Go after the gold!
- Are you serious?

466
00:34:05,927 --> 00:34:11,388
From Las Vegas, let's go to Spencer,
follow the map and see where it leads us!

467
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:14,867
- You're getting a little excited.
- You're damn right.

468
00:34:15,236 --> 00:34:17,761
This could be the opportunity of a lifetime.

469
00:34:17,905 --> 00:34:19,133
Holy...

470
00:34:19,373 --> 00:34:22,069
You are out of control.
Stop and think a minute.

471
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:24,441
Why would Curly keep something
like this in his hat?

472
00:34:24,512 --> 00:34:27,640
He couldn't take a filing cabinet
on the cattle drive.

473
00:34:28,716 --> 00:34:33,176
I mean, why put the map into his hat?
Why didn't he go get the treasure?

474
00:34:33,254 --> 00:34:35,313
Maybe he never got around to it.

475
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:39,416
He never got around to it?
For $20,000,000 you'd budget your time.

476
00:34:41,696 --> 00:34:42,890
Mitch!

477
00:34:48,436 --> 00:34:53,499
When I saw this map, I got excited, too.
But we can't just go nuts. I mean, I'm 40!

478
00:34:53,941 --> 00:34:55,738
What does that mean?

479
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:57,300
I don't know!

480
00:35:01,949 --> 00:35:03,143
Come on!

481
00:35:03,217 --> 00:35:06,277
If you showed me
what any of this has to do with Curly...

482
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:09,585
then I would believe you.
Then I would say, '"It's real.'"

483
00:35:09,657 --> 00:35:11,818
But you can't. So it isn't.

484
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,929
Meet Lincoln Washburn.

485
00:35:27,008 --> 00:35:29,272
Hi, honey, I'm in Las Vegas.

486
00:35:30,144 --> 00:35:32,135
Yeah, at the convention.

487
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:36,244
We're just sitting out here
relaxing by the pool.

488
00:35:36,517 --> 00:35:39,486
Weather's hot, about 120...

489
00:35:39,587 --> 00:35:42,215
but dry, so you don't even notice it.

490
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:44,952
Honey, listen, here's the thing.

491
00:35:45,293 --> 00:35:49,252
They had some sort of an electrical thing
at the hotel.

492
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:54,732
I don't know. It was a thing.
The switchboard blew up.

493
00:35:55,803 --> 00:35:57,794
What the hell am I doing?

494
00:35:58,372 --> 00:36:01,102
No calls coming in, no calls going out.

495
00:36:01,609 --> 00:36:06,308
So you have to call me on the cellular,
'cause I'll have it with me every second.

496
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:10,706
All right. So don't call the hotel...

497
00:36:11,452 --> 00:36:13,283
call me.

498
00:36:15,022 --> 00:36:18,423
I've got to go, honey.
We're going to see Siegfried and Roy.

499
00:36:20,161 --> 00:36:22,254
I love you, too. 'Bye.

500
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,795
You lied to her.

501
00:36:27,869 --> 00:36:30,497
What was I going to do, tell her the truth?

502
00:36:30,571 --> 00:36:34,769
That I'm jeopardizing my career to rent
burros and go hunting for buried treasure?

503
00:36:34,842 --> 00:36:37,276
I'm sure she'd be real supportive.

504
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:41,807
You know,
this whole situation drips with irony.

505
00:36:42,183 --> 00:36:44,378
- Does it?
- Oh, drips.

506
00:36:44,585 --> 00:36:49,545
What if it was my idea instead of yours?
If I was bagging my job to hunt treasure?

507
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:52,855
You'd be saying,
'"Same old crazy, irresponsible Glen.'"

508
00:36:52,927 --> 00:36:56,590
But you do it and it's all right.
How do you explain that?

509
00:36:56,664 --> 00:36:57,926
Listen...

510
00:36:58,065 --> 00:37:01,728
we know it's a day and a half to the gold
and a day and a half back.

511
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:03,895
We'll be back Monday, tops.

512
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:06,769
Wait. Why are you
making me feel guilty about this?

513
00:37:06,841 --> 00:37:09,571
Shouldn't you be grateful
we included you?

514
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:12,044
If it's real, your share could be $7 million...

515
00:37:12,113 --> 00:37:13,740
Everything's set.

516
00:37:14,715 --> 00:37:17,741
Good. Where's my other friend?

517
00:37:17,919 --> 00:37:20,752
He's inside, settling up with my partner.

518
00:37:21,088 --> 00:37:24,785
That's a lot of stuff for
a couple days camping. Shovels, ropes...

519
00:37:24,892 --> 00:37:26,860
Well, actually...

520
00:37:26,928 --> 00:37:29,795
we're seismologists from Caltech.

521
00:37:30,097 --> 00:37:31,724
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

522
00:37:32,566 --> 00:37:35,433
Do you know anything
about geology or earthquakes?

523
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:36,492
No.

524
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:40,472
Well, the continental plates
are in a state of extreme...

525
00:37:40,641 --> 00:37:42,108
seismic tension...

526
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:45,668
throughout this entire
igneous, polygamous, Jurassic...

527
00:37:46,047 --> 00:37:47,605
Hasidic region.

528
00:37:48,049 --> 00:37:51,450
And when the plates
get in that state of tension...

529
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,953
what we have to do is dig down...

530
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:55,913
and relax them.

531
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:58,518
Golly.

532
00:37:58,759 --> 00:38:00,056
Well put.

533
00:38:00,127 --> 00:38:02,994
So there's this guy's picture
in an old newspaper...

534
00:38:03,064 --> 00:38:06,090
and he looks just like the guy
with the map in his hat.

535
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,135
It must have been
his father or his grandfather...

536
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:12,434
but that's what convinced us
the gold is really there.

537
00:38:12,506 --> 00:38:13,734
Phil.

538
00:38:14,809 --> 00:38:19,439
I don't really believe much
in this treasure-hunting business...

539
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:22,845
but I sure do wish you boys
a whole lot of luck.

540
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,350
- We didn't want to look stupid.
- That's all right.

541
00:38:28,422 --> 00:38:31,789
A lot of you city boys come up here
thinking you'll dig up some gold.

542
00:38:31,859 --> 00:38:34,157
Hell, it keeps us in business.

543
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:37,527
- Let's get started. Thank you very much.
- Oh, sure thing.

544
00:38:38,032 --> 00:38:40,660
- All right!
- Now, you boys be careful.

545
00:38:40,768 --> 00:38:45,728
Turn your boots upside down at night,
watch your step, watch where you squat.

546
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:49,102
Squat?

547
00:38:49,377 --> 00:38:54,041
A city boy came here about a year ago.
He was squatting to do his business...

548
00:38:54,115 --> 00:38:57,050
a rattlesnake got him right in the keister.

549
00:39:02,156 --> 00:39:04,716
See you in a couple of days, I hope.

550
00:39:05,226 --> 00:39:07,660
Did you tell him your entire life?

551
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:10,026
- Of course not, I just...
- Phil!

552
00:39:10,898 --> 00:39:13,992
I'd think twice before going back
to your wife.

553
00:39:14,068 --> 00:39:17,196
It'd be like sticking your balls
in a bear trap.

554
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:21,540
That would be a bad thing, right?

555
00:39:25,913 --> 00:39:27,904
I'm joking, it's a joke.

556
00:39:30,918 --> 00:39:34,479
We should go,
'cause, look, we're in a handicapped spot.

557
00:39:40,661 --> 00:39:43,221
Gays in the military. Your thoughts?

558
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:49,163
We'll be back
after these commercial breaks.

559
00:39:49,236 --> 00:39:51,067
'Bye. Let's go, boys.

560
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,277
Good luck.

561
00:40:01,348 --> 00:40:03,908
Hope you find lots and lots of gold.

562
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:24,096
Well?

563
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:26,469
It says, '"The band plays the way.'"

564
00:40:26,707 --> 00:40:29,073
What band? What's '"plays the way'"?

565
00:40:29,143 --> 00:40:31,907
I don't know. This is very hard to read.

566
00:40:35,316 --> 00:40:37,079
Which way is north?

567
00:40:37,651 --> 00:40:38,709
Up.

568
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,787
What do you mean, '"up'"?

569
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:43,119
North on the map is always up.

570
00:40:43,757 --> 00:40:45,816
So, I guess that means...

571
00:40:45,993 --> 00:40:47,620
we should go up.

572
00:40:48,129 --> 00:40:49,391
What are you saying?

573
00:40:49,463 --> 00:40:54,059
Every time you go up you're going north,
and every time you go down, south?

574
00:40:57,071 --> 00:41:00,438
Now you're starting to frighten me.
Hold up here.

575
00:41:01,642 --> 00:41:06,511
Maybe you should have bought a compass
instead of four pounds of tortilla chips.

576
00:41:08,749 --> 00:41:10,512
Let's see.

577
00:41:10,951 --> 00:41:13,283
I can't make out anything here.

578
00:41:13,487 --> 00:41:14,954
Look at this.

579
00:41:15,589 --> 00:41:17,386
It's all written so small.

580
00:41:17,458 --> 00:41:19,858
- I know. What is this?
- I don't know.

581
00:41:19,927 --> 00:41:22,828
- Give me the map.
- Let Magellan have a look.

582
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,365
Yes, some of us come prepared.

583
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,860
Can you hold this, please? Thank you.

584
00:41:28,936 --> 00:41:30,961
Move, you're in my light.

585
00:41:35,609 --> 00:41:36,974
All right.

586
00:41:37,044 --> 00:41:39,672
Now, the sun sets in the east, right?

587
00:41:40,047 --> 00:41:42,413
No, the sun sets in the west.

588
00:41:43,517 --> 00:41:46,714
That's if you're in the East.
But we are way out West now...

589
00:41:46,787 --> 00:41:51,554
- so we are past where the sun sets.
- You can't be past where the sun sets.

590
00:41:51,625 --> 00:41:55,356
And if you think you can,
then I am directly south of an idiot.

591
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:57,329
- Which is down.
- Right.

592
00:41:59,066 --> 00:42:03,230
Speaking of idiots,
it doesn't say, '"The band plays the way.'"

593
00:42:03,304 --> 00:42:05,329
It says, '"The hand points the way.'"

594
00:42:05,406 --> 00:42:07,499
That's a lot better, what does that mean?

595
00:42:11,145 --> 00:42:13,409
- The hand points the way.
- Yes.

596
00:42:21,989 --> 00:42:23,980
The hand points the way.

597
00:42:24,525 --> 00:42:26,288
Look, it's the hand!

598
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:29,193
The hand points the way. The map is real!

599
00:42:31,265 --> 00:42:33,256
Look at it! Here it is!

600
00:42:33,334 --> 00:42:34,995
It's real!

601
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,961
The hand points the way.

602
00:42:40,507 --> 00:42:41,872
All right!

603
00:42:44,511 --> 00:42:46,672
We're going to get the gold!

604
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:50,778
What are you doing?

605
00:42:50,851 --> 00:42:54,252
I'm doing Walter Huston's dance
from Treasure of the Sierra Madre.

606
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:58,155
Oh, yeah. He found the gold
and he did the dance. I loved it.

607
00:42:59,727 --> 00:43:01,752
Rich, boys. We'll be rich.

608
00:43:02,029 --> 00:43:03,121
It's real!

609
00:43:04,565 --> 00:43:06,396
The map is real!

610
00:43:07,101 --> 00:43:08,762
The map is on fire!

611
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,633
- It's on fire!
- Shit!

612
00:43:11,272 --> 00:43:13,672
Get it. Oh, no!

613
00:43:18,045 --> 00:43:19,342
I got it!

614
00:43:30,391 --> 00:43:31,688
Watch it!

615
00:43:50,644 --> 00:43:52,134
Chiropractor.

616
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:53,738
Twelve.

617
00:43:56,283 --> 00:43:57,773
Unbelievable.

618
00:43:58,552 --> 00:43:59,746
Also 12.

619
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:01,879
- How do you do that?
- Fourteen.

620
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:04,983
No, I'm really asking you,
how do you do that?

621
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:10,686
I don't know, I automatically see
how many letters there are in every word.

622
00:44:10,764 --> 00:44:12,891
My brother, the Rain Man.

623
00:44:14,335 --> 00:44:15,825
Wayne Newton.

624
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:16,961
Eleven.

625
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:19,164
Yeah, definitely 11.

626
00:44:21,542 --> 00:44:23,100
Let me ask you:

627
00:44:23,177 --> 00:44:27,170
If I'd actually died today,
would you still be playing this game?

628
00:44:27,881 --> 00:44:31,317
Mitch, it's over.
You're okay. Everybody's okay.

629
00:44:31,652 --> 00:44:33,916
I know, I'm sorry, I'm just...

630
00:44:34,455 --> 00:44:38,551
I'm just a little petrified of heights,
which is why I'm not tall.

631
00:44:38,826 --> 00:44:40,191
Listen, Phil.

632
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:44,560
I'm making you a copy of the map
in case something like this happens again.

633
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,062
So Phil gets a copy, but not me.

634
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:52,064
We don't need three copies.

635
00:44:53,674 --> 00:44:56,768
But why, automatically,
does Phil get the copy?

636
00:44:56,844 --> 00:44:58,835
Well, because...

637
00:45:01,815 --> 00:45:03,009
I see.

638
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:06,613
- What does that mean?
- It means I see.

639
00:45:08,822 --> 00:45:11,518
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to bed.

640
00:45:17,231 --> 00:45:18,664
Listen, Phil.

641
00:45:20,033 --> 00:45:22,866
Is it okay with you if Glen gets the copy?

642
00:45:23,737 --> 00:45:25,898
- Fine.
- Thank you.

643
00:45:27,174 --> 00:45:30,439
I've already given him $7 million,
why not a map?

644
00:45:30,611 --> 00:45:35,071
Okay, here we go. I told you,
I had already invited him to Las Vegas.

645
00:45:35,349 --> 00:45:36,907
What could I say to him?

646
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:39,680
'"Stand by that roulette table,
we'll be back in three days'"?

647
00:45:39,753 --> 00:45:40,742
It was awkward.

648
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:44,188
I know he's your brother
and I know he's a nice guy...

649
00:45:44,258 --> 00:45:48,126
but I've got this terrible feeling
he'll do something to screw this up.

650
00:45:48,195 --> 00:45:50,459
He already set fire to the map.

651
00:45:50,531 --> 00:45:53,728
I know. I'll watch him.
I'll be responsible for him.

652
00:45:53,801 --> 00:45:56,702
I don't want anything to mess this up.
It's too important.

653
00:45:56,770 --> 00:45:59,705
Don't worry. So far, so good.
We're having a great time.

654
00:45:59,773 --> 00:46:01,400
I almost got killed today.

655
00:46:40,147 --> 00:46:41,808
I made you a map.

656
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:44,212
You did?

657
00:46:44,518 --> 00:46:46,952
Yeah, I put it in your saddlebag.

658
00:46:47,287 --> 00:46:48,515
Thanks.

659
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:56,691
It means a lot to me
that you brought me along on this thing.

660
00:46:56,763 --> 00:46:59,789
- Look, come on.
- No, I mean it, you know.

661
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:02,234
It reminds me of...

662
00:47:02,836 --> 00:47:06,704
Remember when Mom would force you to
take me to the movies with your friends?

663
00:47:06,773 --> 00:47:08,240
She never forced me.

664
00:47:08,308 --> 00:47:12,210
She'd just say if I didn't,
she'd hang herself with the good towels.

665
00:47:16,383 --> 00:47:18,851
But you were really nice about it.

666
00:47:19,386 --> 00:47:23,152
I remember you gave me
my own personal box of Milk Duds...

667
00:47:23,223 --> 00:47:25,783
and you'd take me to the bathroom...

668
00:47:26,827 --> 00:47:28,954
during the best part of the movie.

669
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:31,998
And you let me sit next to you.

670
00:47:36,870 --> 00:47:38,861
Can I ask you something?

671
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:40,031
Sure.

672
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:41,665
What do you do?

673
00:47:42,175 --> 00:47:43,665
What do I do?

674
00:47:43,877 --> 00:47:46,812
Sometimes we don't hear from you
for months.

675
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:50,279
I do a lot of things.

676
00:47:50,584 --> 00:47:52,074
Sales, mostly.

677
00:47:53,687 --> 00:47:56,349
For a while I was an animal detective.

678
00:47:56,557 --> 00:48:01,460
What is that? A poodle calls and says,
'"My wife's fooling around with a bulldog'"?

679
00:48:02,996 --> 00:48:04,054
No.

680
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:08,401
Once, by accident, I found a dog
and called the owner.

681
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:11,130
He gave me $100.
So I made a business out of it.

682
00:48:11,204 --> 00:48:14,298
I'd find lost dogs and call the owners.
People paid big ransom.

683
00:48:14,374 --> 00:48:17,775
- Ransom! My God...
- '"Ransom'" is a bad choice of words.

684
00:48:18,111 --> 00:48:21,706
That's the word they used in court,
but I'm still fighting it.

685
00:48:21,782 --> 00:48:23,272
Good for you.

686
00:48:27,354 --> 00:48:29,185
There's Phil's horse.

687
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:31,680
Where's Phil?

688
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,996
- You all right?
- I'll just be a second.

689
00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:44,469
Yeah, right.

690
00:48:50,077 --> 00:48:53,171
He must be having trouble.
Relax, don't strain!

691
00:49:00,454 --> 00:49:01,853
Oh, my God.

692
00:49:04,458 --> 00:49:06,449
Too many tortilla chips.

693
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:08,426
I was bit by a rattler!

694
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:09,961
Mitch, help!

695
00:49:10,297 --> 00:49:11,559
A snake!

696
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:15,899
A rattler!

697
00:49:16,336 --> 00:49:19,635
He bit me on the ass.
God, I'm going to die!

698
00:49:21,241 --> 00:49:22,265
Hold on.

699
00:49:22,342 --> 00:49:25,175
Somebody, suck out the poison. Please!

700
00:49:26,013 --> 00:49:29,915
- He's your friend.
- Yeah, but you slept with his sister.

701
00:49:29,983 --> 00:49:31,883
I'm losing feeling.

702
00:49:32,119 --> 00:49:34,849
Can't we wait till the poison travels up?

703
00:49:34,921 --> 00:49:37,446
I understand. Glen, suck on his ass.

704
00:49:37,524 --> 00:49:38,650
What?

705
00:49:38,959 --> 00:49:40,483
I can't speak.

706
00:49:40,661 --> 00:49:42,322
My tongue's numb.

707
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:46,457
I've done you a million favors,
and one time I ask you to do something...

708
00:49:46,533 --> 00:49:50,731
And the one time is sucking poison
out of your friend's ass? Forget it!

709
00:49:50,804 --> 00:49:52,169
I'm blind.

710
00:49:52,873 --> 00:49:54,397
Where are you?

711
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:56,975
I'm here, Phil.

712
00:49:57,444 --> 00:50:01,710
Don't worry, Phil, I'm going to do it.
But I am not going to forget this, Glen.

713
00:50:04,785 --> 00:50:06,412
Mitch, please...

714
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:09,350
don't tell my kids I died taking a shit.

715
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:11,316
Okay.

716
00:50:15,529 --> 00:50:16,553
Hurry.

717
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:25,961
Would you suck, already?

718
00:50:31,845 --> 00:50:33,836
That is not a snakebite.

719
00:50:37,084 --> 00:50:38,915
You sat on a cactus.

720
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:45,687
You sat on a cactus.

721
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:52,827
I felt the sting, I saw that snake,
and I remembered what those guys said...

722
00:50:54,534 --> 00:50:56,661
I though I was really going to die.

723
00:50:56,737 --> 00:50:59,968
- It's over, you're okay.
- You were going to do it.

724
00:51:00,207 --> 00:51:02,607
You were going to suck on my ass.

725
00:51:03,009 --> 00:51:04,374
It's over.

726
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:07,344
- You're my friend, Mitch.
- Sure I am.

727
00:51:07,414 --> 00:51:09,473
You really care about me!

728
00:51:13,453 --> 00:51:15,080
It's okay, Phil.

729
00:51:17,758 --> 00:51:19,885
He gets a little emotional.

730
00:51:27,901 --> 00:51:29,869
We used to be that close.

731
00:51:29,936 --> 00:51:31,335
Oh, God.

732
00:51:58,565 --> 00:52:00,362
Let's get that gold!

733
00:52:00,967 --> 00:52:02,867
I want that gold!

734
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:09,433
'"This is the business we've chosen.'"

735
00:52:27,594 --> 00:52:30,893
Batting third, and playing center field...

736
00:52:31,164 --> 00:52:33,826
Number 7, Mickey Mantle.

737
00:52:36,937 --> 00:52:38,370
I can't see.

738
00:52:44,177 --> 00:52:46,441
How does the TV know what to record?

739
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:50,038
Because you've told the VCR,
and once you tell the VCR...

740
00:52:50,116 --> 00:52:52,812
- It tells it?
- Yeah, you don't tell the TV anything.

741
00:52:52,886 --> 00:52:54,945
The VCR does all the work.

742
00:52:56,356 --> 00:52:58,916
It's a great convention, honey. I love...

743
00:52:59,192 --> 00:53:00,386
Hello?

744
00:53:35,695 --> 00:53:38,596
Phil, is this beef jerky or turkey jerky?

745
00:53:38,765 --> 00:53:40,392
Does it really matter?

746
00:53:41,034 --> 00:53:43,002
How do they make it, anyway?

747
00:53:43,103 --> 00:53:45,628
Jerky? It's an interesting process.

748
00:53:45,705 --> 00:53:47,969
Take a really good piece of meat...

749
00:53:48,041 --> 00:53:51,772
then a New York City cab driver
sits on it for four months.

750
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:59,813
How will those two laughing idiots
we rented this stuff from feel...

751
00:53:59,886 --> 00:54:02,320
when we bring back all that gold?

752
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:08,094
The looks on those faces,
those tobacco-chewing, gun-rack-having...

753
00:54:08,461 --> 00:54:13,421
chicken-screwing, sister-marrying,
abandoned-toilet-seat-in-the-yard-having...

754
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,060
vitamin-deficiencied, ugly faces.

755
00:54:16,703 --> 00:54:19,001
They're behind me, aren't they?

756
00:54:21,074 --> 00:54:22,701
Howdy, boys.

757
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:31,246
What a coincidence.
We were just talking about you.

758
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:33,751
- What are you doing here?
- We followed you.

759
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:37,221
Isn't that nice, huh? Talk about service.

760
00:54:37,290 --> 00:54:40,691
Everything is great.
The equipment, the food...

761
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:44,856
That jerky, forget about it.
Better than Mom's, but she used onions...

762
00:54:44,931 --> 00:54:46,523
We want the map!

763
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:48,324
Map?

764
00:54:48,401 --> 00:54:51,302
The one old Stretch there told us about.

765
00:54:51,438 --> 00:54:52,962
Oh, the map.

766
00:54:55,809 --> 00:55:00,303
Like you said, we're like all those dumb
city boys who come looking for treasure.

767
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:02,739
Nope.

768
00:55:02,816 --> 00:55:07,310
This cowboy kept this map in his hat,
and that means it was something special.

769
00:55:08,021 --> 00:55:11,081
- And if his daddy did that holdup...
- We want that map!

770
00:55:11,157 --> 00:55:14,320
- Don't make us look for it.
- Fellas, come on now.

771
00:55:15,795 --> 00:55:18,730
I know what you're feeling,
I've been there.

772
00:55:19,632 --> 00:55:21,259
I'm still there.

773
00:55:21,501 --> 00:55:24,129
You feel like you have no control
over your life...

774
00:55:24,204 --> 00:55:26,172
that nothing makes sense...

775
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:28,173
It's in the saddle bag.

776
00:55:36,716 --> 00:55:40,447
Come on, you can't leave us like this.
We won't make any trouble.

777
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:45,014
We've got families, we've got kids.
Let us go and we'll forget the whole thing.

778
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:47,184
- Absolutely.
- Not me.

779
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:49,592
If I ever see either of you, I'll kill you!

780
00:55:49,662 --> 00:55:51,391
Will you shut up?

781
00:55:51,464 --> 00:55:52,726
Pig-boy!

782
00:55:59,372 --> 00:56:02,239
That's my wife. I really should take this.

783
00:56:02,308 --> 00:56:05,334
So if you'd just pull it out
and press '"Send'"?

784
00:56:12,252 --> 00:56:15,449
Looks like you won't be talking
to her after all.

785
00:56:16,990 --> 00:56:18,617
All right, look...

786
00:56:18,925 --> 00:56:20,722
you got two choices.

787
00:56:20,827 --> 00:56:24,593
We can leave you here, and animals
will smell your flesh burning in the sun...

788
00:56:24,664 --> 00:56:27,758
and will come down here
and chew you up pretty bad.

789
00:56:27,834 --> 00:56:28,892
Or?

790
00:56:29,202 --> 00:56:31,932
We can shoot you in the head right now.

791
00:56:33,073 --> 00:56:35,439
I think we shoot them right now.

792
00:56:35,842 --> 00:56:37,833
Got any last words?

793
00:57:12,645 --> 00:57:15,307
Curly, I knew it! You're alive!

794
00:57:19,085 --> 00:57:22,316
I swear, we thought you were dead.
We didn't know.

795
00:57:23,123 --> 00:57:24,647
Please, Curly.

796
00:57:27,227 --> 00:57:30,628
I'm sorry we buried you,
but you looked so dead.

797
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:34,022
Sorry, Curly.

798
00:57:34,167 --> 00:57:36,101
I'm not Curly.

799
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:39,067
I'm Duke.

800
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:41,466
Duke?

801
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,539
Curly was my brother.

802
00:57:44,611 --> 00:57:46,078
Your brother?

803
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:48,842
Brother?

804
00:57:50,517 --> 00:57:52,007
The other night...

805
00:57:52,085 --> 00:57:55,077
it was you on the train to New Rochelle,
wasn't it?

806
00:57:55,155 --> 00:57:56,247
Yeah.

807
00:57:56,322 --> 00:58:00,486
And I was outside your window that night.
You have a lovely home.

808
00:58:00,627 --> 00:58:04,119
Thank you, we did a lot of work.
Where you were used to be a tool shed.

809
00:58:04,197 --> 00:58:06,927
The other side was a total disaster.
The wood rot...

810
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,059
Where is my brother's map?

811
00:58:09,202 --> 00:58:11,602
The map. They got the map.

812
00:58:11,804 --> 00:58:13,465
You gave them...

813
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:16,600
- You gave them my brother's map?
- No, it's okay.

814
00:58:16,676 --> 00:58:19,236
- They don't have the real map.
- What?

815
00:58:19,412 --> 00:58:22,381
What do you mean?
It's the map you gave me.

816
00:58:22,448 --> 00:58:25,815
I didn't make you a real copy, I changed it.

817
00:58:25,985 --> 00:58:28,476
- Why?
- In case something like this happened.

818
00:58:28,555 --> 00:58:30,147
You didn't trust me.

819
00:58:30,223 --> 00:58:34,091
I drew you a copy that led to the highway!
I wanted you to be safe.

820
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:37,095
No! You thought I'd sneak off
and steal the gold.

821
00:58:37,163 --> 00:58:38,858
No, I didn't. L...

822
00:58:41,334 --> 00:58:43,768
Would you two pixies knock it off?

823
00:58:46,005 --> 00:58:48,530
Where's the damn map?

824
00:58:59,385 --> 00:59:01,785
What the hell are you staring at?

825
00:59:01,988 --> 00:59:04,786
Curly's twin, I can't get over it.

826
00:59:05,191 --> 00:59:06,920
Well, get over it...

827
00:59:06,993 --> 00:59:09,359
or I'll turn you into twins.

828
00:59:11,297 --> 00:59:12,662
Oh, I see.

829
00:59:16,502 --> 00:59:21,496
That piece was missing when we found it.
And I accidentally burned that hole.

830
00:59:25,578 --> 00:59:29,412
Can't tell you how often my daddy
put me and my brother on his knees...

831
00:59:29,515 --> 00:59:31,745
and told us about this treasure.

832
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:34,912
He said we'd all go out together
when the time was ripe...

833
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:38,515
- when they weren't watching him.
- Why did you wait so long?

834
00:59:38,591 --> 00:59:40,718
If Curly had the map, why didn't you...

835
00:59:40,793 --> 00:59:43,853
We didn't know there was a map
till a year ago.

836
00:59:46,032 --> 00:59:47,522
Our mom died.

837
00:59:48,601 --> 00:59:50,000
She was 95.

838
00:59:51,571 --> 00:59:53,505
Stabbed at a bar fight.

839
00:59:57,410 --> 00:59:59,901
She gave Curly the map on her deathbed.

840
00:59:59,979 --> 01:00:03,915
He wrote to me, told me to come home,
that we'd be rich.

841
01:00:03,983 --> 01:00:07,384
Till then,
he was going to keep it under his hat.

842
01:00:07,887 --> 01:00:09,445
Where were you?

843
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:12,119
You writing a book?

844
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:13,750
No.

845
01:00:15,561 --> 01:00:17,586
By the time I got back...

846
01:00:17,730 --> 01:00:20,164
Curly had died on a cattle drive.

847
01:00:22,302 --> 01:00:24,270
Dumb son-of-a-bitch.

848
01:00:25,972 --> 01:00:27,735
His pal, Cookie...

849
01:00:28,274 --> 01:00:32,108
told me that you had his hat,
so I came looking for you.

850
01:00:32,312 --> 01:00:33,779
Found you, didn't I?

851
01:00:33,846 --> 01:00:37,976
Why didn't you just knock and tell me?
Why did you scare the life out of me?

852
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:40,645
Because I didn't know
what kind of guy you were.

853
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,689
And I wasn't sure
you knew about the map.

854
01:00:43,756 --> 01:00:45,383
If you didn't...

855
01:00:45,491 --> 01:00:47,857
I sure wasn't going to tell you.

856
01:00:48,127 --> 01:00:52,120
Then you came out here,
I figured I'd let you do all the work...

857
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:54,495
and then just take it from you.

858
01:00:56,202 --> 01:00:58,670
You guys ought to head back to town.

859
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:00,968
Back, what do you mean, back?

860
01:01:01,808 --> 01:01:04,538
Your mommies will be worried about you.

861
01:01:06,446 --> 01:01:08,209
Thanks for the map.

862
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:12,081
Hey, wait a second, you can't...

863
01:01:12,652 --> 01:01:14,142
I can't what?

864
01:01:17,023 --> 01:01:18,285
Nothing.

865
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:39,373
That's it, I guess.

866
01:01:58,364 --> 01:01:59,888
What the hell do you want?

867
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:03,367
You may look like Curly,
but you're nothing like him.

868
01:02:06,239 --> 01:02:08,901
Curly was a good man, a decent man.

869
01:02:09,041 --> 01:02:10,565
He had dignity.

870
01:02:10,643 --> 01:02:14,306
He wouldn't like to see you
treating his friends like this.

871
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:16,644
- You were his friend?
- Yeah.

872
01:02:16,716 --> 01:02:19,014
As a matter of fact,
he changed my whole life.

873
01:02:19,085 --> 01:02:22,646
I was really confused,
and he told me that one thing...

874
01:02:23,356 --> 01:02:25,688
He told you about that one thing?

875
01:02:25,758 --> 01:02:28,989
Yeah. And if he was here
and saw what you were doing...

876
01:02:29,061 --> 01:02:31,529
he would kick the living shit out of you.

877
01:02:33,299 --> 01:02:36,029
So, Curly told you about the one thing.

878
01:02:38,671 --> 01:02:40,605
He must have liked you.

879
01:02:41,140 --> 01:02:42,368
He did.

880
01:02:49,115 --> 01:02:51,413
You and your friends want to ride along...

881
01:02:51,484 --> 01:02:52,951
As partners?

882
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:56,887
Hell, half of what's up there
is more than I'll ever need.

883
01:02:57,156 --> 01:02:58,282
Half?

884
01:02:58,658 --> 01:03:02,321
You mean, you get a half
and the three of us have to split a half?

885
01:03:04,630 --> 01:03:07,360
Which is fine. I'll go along with that.

886
01:03:08,935 --> 01:03:10,903
Just remember something.

887
01:03:10,970 --> 01:03:13,438
Don't mess with us, pal.
We're from New York.

888
01:03:18,709 --> 01:03:21,337
You ever talk to me like that again...

889
01:03:21,411 --> 01:03:23,572
and I'll turn your balls...

890
01:03:23,747 --> 01:03:26,477
into earrings. Understand?

891
01:03:27,584 --> 01:03:28,949
Go for it.

892
01:03:35,325 --> 01:03:38,488
We're close. Less than a day.

893
01:03:39,997 --> 01:03:43,489
Can you hear it?
That's the gold, it's singing to us:

894
01:03:43,667 --> 01:03:45,362
'"Come and get me.'"

895
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:51,701
Curly was wrong, there are two things.

896
01:03:52,476 --> 01:03:54,637
Whatever the hell this is...

897
01:03:55,279 --> 01:03:57,304
and gold.

898
01:04:00,384 --> 01:04:02,011
Let's go get it.

899
01:04:27,577 --> 01:04:32,241
Phil, you won't meet women sitting
at home reading those Time-Life books.

900
01:04:32,316 --> 01:04:33,908
You gotta get out, go places.

901
01:04:33,984 --> 01:04:36,851
If a woman wants someone like me,
she goes to the pound...

902
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:39,480
and gets herself a three-legged dog.

903
01:04:40,324 --> 01:04:42,724
If this isn't too personal a question...

904
01:04:42,793 --> 01:04:45,660
when's the last time
you were with a woman?

905
01:04:47,331 --> 01:04:48,628
Saturday.

906
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:50,790
Saturday will be a year.

907
01:04:52,469 --> 01:04:55,063
If I'd known
I would have gotten you a cake.

908
01:04:55,138 --> 01:04:56,537
Who was she?

909
01:04:56,606 --> 01:04:59,905
- This girl I met on the cattle drive.
- Bonnie.

910
01:04:59,976 --> 01:05:01,807
Right, Bonnie. She was cute.

911
01:05:01,978 --> 01:05:04,173
She was really sweet, too, but...

912
01:05:04,247 --> 01:05:08,445
I was two weeks out of my marriage.
I was just a huge sack of tears.

913
01:05:08,618 --> 01:05:10,916
Wonder if I still know how to do it?

914
01:05:10,987 --> 01:05:14,923
Come on, it's like riding a bicycle,
only you're naked.

915
01:05:14,991 --> 01:05:18,984
Speaking of which, did you ever
walk in on our parents doing it?

916
01:05:19,296 --> 01:05:20,354
No.

917
01:05:20,897 --> 01:05:22,660
- Why, did you?
- Yes.

918
01:05:26,737 --> 01:05:28,762
- Really?
- Worst thing I've ever seen.

919
01:05:28,839 --> 01:05:31,205
It's a horrible thing for a little kid to see.

920
01:05:31,274 --> 01:05:33,504
This was three weeks ago, in Florida.

921
01:05:34,378 --> 01:05:37,176
- Did you walk into the bedroom?
- It was in the kitchen.

922
01:05:38,715 --> 01:05:42,116
Apparently it was spontaneous,
because Pop still had his hat on...

923
01:05:42,185 --> 01:05:45,211
the one with fake grass and a golf ball.
It was horrible.

924
01:05:45,288 --> 01:05:48,052
Wax fruit flying every place, dog barking...

925
01:05:48,125 --> 01:05:50,923
my kids' pictures flapping up and down
on the refrigerator.

926
01:05:51,094 --> 01:05:53,722
- Okay, stop it.
- Pop was working hard.

927
01:05:55,031 --> 01:05:57,864
'"Enough of that, did you take the car in? '"

928
01:05:57,934 --> 01:05:59,959
I think that's beautiful.

929
01:06:00,270 --> 01:06:01,601
Not from my angle.

930
01:06:01,671 --> 01:06:05,129
Two people in love after all those years,
that's great.

931
01:06:05,208 --> 01:06:08,041
Great? An hour later we ate on that table.

932
01:06:26,763 --> 01:06:28,060
You okay?

933
01:06:29,866 --> 01:06:33,802
- First time on a horse in 50 years.
- What? But you're a cowboy.

934
01:06:35,238 --> 01:06:38,867
I was born around here,
but left when I was 15.

935
01:06:39,109 --> 01:06:40,770
Where did you go?

936
01:06:41,278 --> 01:06:42,802
World War II.

937
01:06:43,079 --> 01:06:45,741
Lied about my age and joined the Navy.

938
01:06:46,516 --> 01:06:49,280
First look at the big blue. After the war...

939
01:06:49,386 --> 01:06:53,254
Merchant Marine, charter boats,
anything to stay on the ocean.

940
01:06:55,325 --> 01:06:58,158
Been around the world 21 times.

941
01:06:59,062 --> 01:07:01,394
Curly loved the land.

942
01:07:01,498 --> 01:07:03,125
I loved the sea.

943
01:07:03,733 --> 01:07:06,065
So you're like surf and turf.

944
01:07:08,171 --> 01:07:10,298
- You thought that was funny?
- No.

945
01:07:10,707 --> 01:07:13,073
I'm just thinking what I'd like to do to you.

946
01:07:30,794 --> 01:07:31,818
Look at that.

947
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:35,857
Look at how great he looks.

948
01:07:36,366 --> 01:07:38,061
Majestic, you know?

949
01:07:38,134 --> 01:07:41,934
I had a dream about a horse like this.
I want to ride alongside him.

950
01:07:42,038 --> 01:07:43,027
Why?

951
01:07:43,106 --> 01:07:45,734
To see what it's like
riding alongside a wild animal.

952
01:07:45,809 --> 01:07:48,039
It's like going on vacation with Arlene.

953
01:07:51,181 --> 01:07:52,273
Come on.

954
01:09:01,718 --> 01:09:03,345
Where did he go?

955
01:09:22,472 --> 01:09:23,598
Shit!

956
01:09:29,212 --> 01:09:30,804
Where did he go?

957
01:09:32,716 --> 01:09:33,910
Quiet.

958
01:09:41,725 --> 01:09:43,955
- What is that?
- It's an earthquake.

959
01:09:45,528 --> 01:09:46,893
Go! Go!

960
01:09:47,097 --> 01:09:49,565
He's got friends, get out of here!

961
01:09:52,168 --> 01:09:53,465
Stampede!

962
01:09:57,641 --> 01:09:59,006
Holy shit!

963
01:10:08,618 --> 01:10:09,880
Go! Go!

964
01:10:12,088 --> 01:10:15,023
Let's head for the trees. Come on, go!

965
01:10:21,798 --> 01:10:23,425
Let's go, come on.

966
01:10:34,244 --> 01:10:35,711
Oh, no! Duke!

967
01:10:43,353 --> 01:10:46,186
- I lost the goddamn...
- Forget the map, come on!

968
01:10:46,423 --> 01:10:49,119
- Son-of-a-bitch!
- Let's get out of here!

969
01:10:56,766 --> 01:10:58,597
I'm going after Glen.

970
01:10:59,436 --> 01:11:00,562
Help!

971
01:11:03,139 --> 01:11:04,128
Mitch!

972
01:11:22,525 --> 01:11:23,514
Help!

973
01:11:25,562 --> 01:11:26,927
I'm coming!

974
01:11:29,299 --> 01:11:31,824
- Pull them up!
- Which ones?

975
01:11:31,901 --> 01:11:34,335
Get to the front and pull them up!

976
01:11:35,505 --> 01:11:36,733
I can't!

977
01:11:44,881 --> 01:11:46,007
Mitch!

978
01:11:50,253 --> 01:11:51,379
One...

979
01:11:51,454 --> 01:11:52,614
two...

980
01:12:01,765 --> 01:12:02,754
Mitch!

981
01:12:09,606 --> 01:12:11,335
What are you doing?

982
01:12:11,941 --> 01:12:14,068
I'm saving you, you schmuck.

983
01:12:21,284 --> 01:12:23,616
Glen, the wagon's coming apart!

984
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:26,445
- What?
- You'll have to jump.

985
01:12:46,209 --> 01:12:48,973
We're coming to the edge,
you've got to jump now!

986
01:12:49,045 --> 01:12:50,740
- I can't!
- Jump!

987
01:12:50,814 --> 01:12:53,146
- I can't!
- You pain in the ass...

988
01:12:53,416 --> 01:12:57,614
listen to me, for once.
Get your fat ass out here, and jump now!

989
01:12:57,987 --> 01:12:59,750
Come on, jump...

990
01:13:00,523 --> 01:13:01,717
now!

991
01:13:05,628 --> 01:13:08,893
- Mitch, do something!
- Hold on!

992
01:13:58,081 --> 01:14:00,481
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

993
01:14:02,785 --> 01:14:04,252
Are you okay?

994
01:14:04,921 --> 01:14:05,910
Yeah.

995
01:14:10,460 --> 01:14:12,189
You can let go now.

996
01:14:13,863 --> 01:14:14,955
Soon.

997
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:39,215
You saved my life!

998
01:14:40,089 --> 01:14:42,990
You are amazing!
And the way you did it...

999
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:48,394
This is a whole lot different
than just sucking on Phil's ass.

1000
01:14:50,667 --> 01:14:51,998
Excuse me?

1001
01:14:53,369 --> 01:14:54,996
Did I hear right?

1002
01:14:55,338 --> 01:14:58,899
- Yeah, Phil thought that a snake bit him...
- I don't care.

1003
01:15:01,344 --> 01:15:03,369
Now, whatever went on before...

1004
01:15:03,746 --> 01:15:05,407
stops now.

1005
01:15:08,618 --> 01:15:10,552
Is this real bad?

1006
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:12,512
It looks like...

1007
01:15:12,755 --> 01:15:15,451
you spent the night
with a Singapore hooker.

1008
01:15:15,525 --> 01:15:17,152
Great, that's it.

1009
01:15:20,263 --> 01:15:21,525
I'm dead.

1010
01:15:21,597 --> 01:15:24,794
- They're just scratches.
- No, you don't get it.

1011
01:15:25,134 --> 01:15:26,863
Barbara can't reach me.

1012
01:15:26,936 --> 01:15:29,200
By now, she's called the hotel in Vegas...

1013
01:15:29,272 --> 01:15:33,333
and realized that I've been lying to her.
Then I return with scratches on my back?

1014
01:15:33,409 --> 01:15:35,274
That's it, it is over. I'm divorced.

1015
01:15:35,345 --> 01:15:39,213
By this time next week,
I'll be having a candlelit dinner with Phil.

1016
01:15:39,282 --> 01:15:42,308
Well, pick a night, 'cause the map is gone.

1017
01:15:44,821 --> 01:15:48,257
Everything's been trampled:
The food, tents, sleeping bags...

1018
01:15:48,324 --> 01:15:49,791
What's left?

1019
01:15:49,892 --> 01:15:52,884
Three miner's helmets
and a tube of Chap Stick.

1020
01:15:52,962 --> 01:15:54,827
What's the difference?

1021
01:15:55,932 --> 01:15:58,765
The only thing that mattered
was that map.

1022
01:16:06,175 --> 01:16:08,609
- This is all my fault.
- Your fault?

1023
01:16:09,078 --> 01:16:10,545
I dropped it.

1024
01:16:10,613 --> 01:16:14,379
You wouldn't have,
if I hadn't frolicked with some stallion.

1025
01:16:17,253 --> 01:16:18,845
I'm sorry, Duke.

1026
01:16:19,188 --> 01:16:20,815
I'm really sorry.

1027
01:16:22,091 --> 01:16:26,755
If we don't get lost, will we make it
back to town before we starve to death?

1028
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:29,823
It's only a day and a half.
I can use every second...

1029
01:16:29,899 --> 01:16:32,299
to think of another lie to tell Barbara.

1030
01:16:33,336 --> 01:16:35,201
If you guys go home...

1031
01:16:35,505 --> 01:16:38,235
I'm not splitting the treasure with you.

1032
01:16:38,307 --> 01:16:42,937
- What? You're not coming back with us?
- No. The gold is that way.

1033
01:16:43,012 --> 01:16:47,244
Yes, but the grand-slam pancake breakfast
at the Mirage is that way.

1034
01:16:47,483 --> 01:16:49,383
Duke, we've got no map.

1035
01:16:49,986 --> 01:16:53,217
What will you do? Wander around
hoping to stumble onto the gold?

1036
01:16:53,289 --> 01:16:54,517
Something like that.

1037
01:16:54,590 --> 01:16:57,991
Please don't take this the wrong way,
but you're insane.

1038
01:16:58,561 --> 01:17:02,463
Insane is coming this far
and then just going back.

1039
01:17:06,536 --> 01:17:09,164
If you guys want to go home, go ahead.

1040
01:17:10,006 --> 01:17:11,633
But, that gold...

1041
01:17:15,278 --> 01:17:17,803
That's the only dream I've got left.

1042
01:17:23,553 --> 01:17:25,646
'"Over the buffalo's back...

1043
01:17:25,922 --> 01:17:28,152
'"and under the frozen people.'"

1044
01:17:28,491 --> 01:17:29,583
What?

1045
01:17:30,893 --> 01:17:33,726
'"Over the buffalo's back
and under the frozen people! '"

1046
01:17:33,796 --> 01:17:35,286
That's the rest of the map.

1047
01:17:36,999 --> 01:17:40,196
How do you know?
You never even saw the real map.

1048
01:17:40,269 --> 01:17:44,399
I saw it yesterday for a minute
when we were looking for the hand.

1049
01:17:45,641 --> 01:17:50,237
This isn't memorizing a movie,
or telling how many letters are in '"falafel'".

1050
01:17:50,313 --> 01:17:52,338
Seven. Now, I'm telling you...

1051
01:17:52,415 --> 01:17:54,849
that gold will be in our hands
by tomorrow night.

1052
01:17:54,917 --> 01:17:56,851
I can draw you the exact map.

1053
01:17:56,919 --> 01:18:00,218
I can get us there.
All you have to do is trust me.

1054
01:18:03,292 --> 01:18:04,782
Mitch, please...

1055
01:18:04,861 --> 01:18:06,829
for once in your life...

1056
01:18:07,530 --> 01:18:09,020
just trust me.

1057
01:18:23,846 --> 01:18:25,177
Trust you?

1058
01:18:28,751 --> 01:18:31,015
Are you sure it said, '"buffalo's back'"?

1059
01:18:31,087 --> 01:18:34,488
We haven't seen anything
that looks like a buffalo's back. Nothing.

1060
01:18:34,557 --> 01:18:35,751
You know something?

1061
01:18:35,825 --> 01:18:38,385
You have not stopped whining
since we started.

1062
01:18:38,461 --> 01:18:41,453
It's like going on vacation
with an ambulance.

1063
01:18:41,564 --> 01:18:44,260
Shut up! You shouldn't even be on this!

1064
01:18:45,067 --> 01:18:48,332
Yeah? If it wasn't for me,
we wouldn't even be here.

1065
01:18:48,437 --> 01:18:50,098
Freezing to death!

1066
01:18:51,574 --> 01:18:53,439
Hurry, it's going out!

1067
01:18:59,682 --> 01:19:01,445
That's the last one.

1068
01:19:08,658 --> 01:19:10,023
Good night.

1069
01:19:10,092 --> 01:19:13,584
Good night? How about good-bye?
We're going to die up here.

1070
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:15,324
The sun's up in...

1071
01:19:15,698 --> 01:19:17,063
five hours.

1072
01:19:17,733 --> 01:19:20,668
Tomorrow morning
we're all going to be rich.

1073
01:19:29,011 --> 01:19:30,672
Hey, look, guys...

1074
01:19:30,746 --> 01:19:32,941
we're really in trouble here.

1075
01:19:35,718 --> 01:19:37,743
In case we never find our way out...

1076
01:19:37,820 --> 01:19:39,481
and I die first...

1077
01:19:41,123 --> 01:19:42,317
eat me.

1078
01:19:44,627 --> 01:19:45,821
Eat you?

1079
01:19:46,929 --> 01:19:49,056
I mean, if you're starving to death.

1080
01:19:49,131 --> 01:19:52,567
Eat you? I don't even like
talking to you on the phone.

1081
01:19:52,635 --> 01:19:56,264
I'm willing to sacrifice myself
for the good of the group.

1082
01:19:56,572 --> 01:19:57,834
'"Eat me'"?

1083
01:19:58,174 --> 01:20:00,438
What a lovely image: '"Eat me.'"

1084
01:20:00,509 --> 01:20:02,943
Glen, I'm still hungry.
Is there any more Phil?

1085
01:20:03,012 --> 01:20:04,673
Pass the Phil.

1086
01:20:05,648 --> 01:20:07,343
He's even good cold!

1087
01:20:07,416 --> 01:20:09,976
Great party, thanks to Phil.

1088
01:20:11,554 --> 01:20:13,579
All right, so don't eat me.

1089
01:20:13,689 --> 01:20:17,455
Jesus Christ!
What a bunch of little pisspots.

1090
01:20:26,836 --> 01:20:30,294
Maybe if we huddled together,
we could share our body warmth.

1091
01:20:30,373 --> 01:20:33,809
I read in my Time-Life book
people can survive that way.

1092
01:20:33,909 --> 01:20:36,434
I mean, we're three 98.6s.

1093
01:20:36,979 --> 01:20:38,947
How much is that, Glen?

1094
01:20:39,015 --> 01:20:41,950
295.8. That's too hot.

1095
01:20:43,519 --> 01:20:45,487
So, what are you saying?

1096
01:20:45,788 --> 01:20:47,517
Well, I'm saying...

1097
01:20:48,124 --> 01:20:49,614
we should hug.

1098
01:20:50,393 --> 01:20:51,758
All night?

1099
01:20:53,529 --> 01:20:54,518
Yeah.

1100
01:20:57,400 --> 01:20:58,458
Okay.

1101
01:20:59,802 --> 01:21:01,292
Come on, Glen.

1102
01:21:13,282 --> 01:21:14,408
Easy.

1103
01:21:21,390 --> 01:21:23,756
Hold still. I'm trying to sleep.

1104
01:21:29,865 --> 01:21:31,355
You know what?

1105
01:21:32,201 --> 01:21:34,066
It is a little warmer.

1106
01:21:39,575 --> 01:21:40,906
Hey, guys?

1107
01:21:42,845 --> 01:21:44,437
What about Duke?

1108
01:21:45,214 --> 01:21:46,738
What about him?

1109
01:21:48,217 --> 01:21:50,117
Shouldn't we invite...

1110
01:21:50,820 --> 01:21:53,448
- invite him to...
- To what? To join us?

1111
01:21:53,756 --> 01:21:56,190
- What are you, crazy?
- Look at him.

1112
01:21:56,926 --> 01:21:58,393
He could die.

1113
01:21:59,762 --> 01:22:01,389
This isn't right.

1114
01:22:03,065 --> 01:22:04,430
Who's going to ask him?

1115
01:22:07,269 --> 01:22:10,466
- You've been getting along with him best.
- Don't make me do this.

1116
01:22:10,539 --> 01:22:11,733
Go.

1117
01:22:12,908 --> 01:22:14,398
Save my place.

1118
01:22:21,851 --> 01:22:22,943
Duke?

1119
01:22:23,719 --> 01:22:26,415
- Yeah.
- The guys and I were wondering...

1120
01:22:26,489 --> 01:22:29,481
if you'd like to come back
to our place and...

1121
01:22:29,859 --> 01:22:32,487
you know, maybe we could all...

1122
01:22:35,631 --> 01:22:36,655
All what?

1123
01:22:39,034 --> 01:22:40,023
Hug.

1124
01:22:41,437 --> 01:22:42,699
Holy God.

1125
01:22:42,872 --> 01:22:46,000
- I'm up here with a goddamn musical.
- No.

1126
01:22:47,743 --> 01:22:49,472
What I meant was...

1127
01:22:51,313 --> 01:22:52,803
body warmth.

1128
01:22:53,015 --> 01:22:55,711
And if we press against each other...

1129
01:22:58,621 --> 01:23:00,919
Come on, you could die up here.

1130
01:23:01,090 --> 01:23:02,250
Maybe.

1131
01:23:07,830 --> 01:23:09,092
Curly...

1132
01:23:09,765 --> 01:23:11,392
ever mention me?

1133
01:23:11,767 --> 01:23:14,861
Well, Curly wasn't really
what you'd call gabby.

1134
01:23:15,805 --> 01:23:19,536
He wasn't that chatterbox
that you remember from your youth.

1135
01:23:20,443 --> 01:23:23,970
- When was the last time you saw him?
- Oh, God, long ago.

1136
01:23:24,713 --> 01:23:26,806
But when you have a twin...

1137
01:23:26,882 --> 01:23:29,817
you see him every time
you look in the mirror.

1138
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:34,648
Sometimes you don't know
what you have, until...

1139
01:23:35,191 --> 01:23:37,489
Till you don't have it anymore.

1140
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:39,951
I liked having a brother.

1141
01:23:42,932 --> 01:23:44,297
Did Curly...

1142
01:23:44,867 --> 01:23:46,232
die happy?

1143
01:23:47,403 --> 01:23:48,893
Does anybody?

1144
01:23:51,607 --> 01:23:53,438
Well, I think he did.

1145
01:23:53,909 --> 01:23:58,778
One of the last things he said to me was,
'"There's nothing like bringing in a herd.'"

1146
01:23:58,848 --> 01:24:01,646
It must be how you feel
when you're at sea.

1147
01:24:02,284 --> 01:24:05,583
I lost my boat in a squall
about two years ago.

1148
01:24:05,654 --> 01:24:07,246
Half-squall.

1149
01:24:07,323 --> 01:24:10,884
I just wasn't a good enough sailor,
so I came ashore.

1150
01:24:12,695 --> 01:24:14,686
What have you been doing since?

1151
01:24:14,763 --> 01:24:16,788
A friend of mine's son...

1152
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:22,301
opened a seafood restaurant in San Diego,
The Happy Pirate.

1153
01:24:23,339 --> 01:24:25,773
- I work there.
- You're the manager?

1154
01:24:27,843 --> 01:24:29,743
I am the happy pirate.

1155
01:24:29,912 --> 01:24:32,312
Bird on my shoulder, pirate hat...

1156
01:24:32,381 --> 01:24:34,178
one hand's a hook.

1157
01:24:34,383 --> 01:24:37,443
'"How would you like
your burger cooked, matey? '"

1158
01:24:39,822 --> 01:24:43,849
Sometimes I can't stand it, I want
to spit in their goddamn clam chowder.

1159
01:24:43,926 --> 01:24:46,258
I've been a sailor for 50 years.

1160
01:24:46,328 --> 01:24:48,296
I don't know how to do anything else.

1161
01:24:48,364 --> 01:24:49,991
I'd just be lost.

1162
01:24:52,201 --> 01:24:53,600
Mitch, I...

1163
01:24:54,270 --> 01:24:56,363
I've got to find that gold.

1164
01:24:56,972 --> 01:24:58,599
I need that gold.

1165
01:25:39,315 --> 01:25:42,341
Guys, come on. Are you all right?

1166
01:25:42,818 --> 01:25:45,616
You all right? Come on, wake up.

1167
01:25:46,522 --> 01:25:48,956
Guys, we made it! We're alive.

1168
01:25:49,658 --> 01:25:51,421
Come on, we did it.

1169
01:25:51,493 --> 01:25:53,085
Come on, get up.

1170
01:25:53,596 --> 01:25:55,461
All right, now listen.

1171
01:25:55,764 --> 01:25:58,995
This is it. This is finished.
We're going back.

1172
01:25:59,501 --> 01:26:01,332
Listen, no arguments, Glen.

1173
01:26:01,403 --> 01:26:03,598
We'll never survive another night like this.

1174
01:26:03,672 --> 01:26:06,232
- You got no argument here. Let's just go.
- Right.

1175
01:26:06,308 --> 01:26:08,173
We'd better tell Duke.

1176
01:26:09,845 --> 01:26:11,244
Where is he?

1177
01:26:12,648 --> 01:26:15,549
You guys pack up, I'll go find him.
Come on.

1178
01:26:19,722 --> 01:26:20,848
Duke?

1179
01:26:41,710 --> 01:26:42,904
Oh, no.

1180
01:26:43,479 --> 01:26:44,912
Not him, too.

1181
01:26:45,447 --> 01:26:48,746
What is with this family?
Everybody dies sitting up?

1182
01:26:49,518 --> 01:26:51,884
You wouldn't hug us, you big dope!

1183
01:26:53,522 --> 01:26:56,685
You thought I was dead, didn't you?
What do you want?

1184
01:26:56,759 --> 01:26:58,056
Listen, Duke...

1185
01:26:58,260 --> 01:27:02,060
I know what this treasure means to you,
but we're going back.

1186
01:27:03,732 --> 01:27:05,723
You mean, back that way?

1187
01:27:07,236 --> 01:27:11,696
- Over the buffalo's back?
- What buffalo's back? There isn't any!

1188
01:27:11,774 --> 01:27:15,574
There's a buffalo's back down there.
Here, look through this.

1189
01:27:16,145 --> 01:27:17,703
Look down there.

1190
01:27:18,814 --> 01:27:22,079
We crossed it in the dark
and didn't even know it.

1191
01:27:22,851 --> 01:27:24,182
Glen was right.

1192
01:27:24,253 --> 01:27:26,517
He was also right about the frozen people.

1193
01:27:26,588 --> 01:27:29,056
- How do you know?
- Look down there.

1194
01:27:30,626 --> 01:27:32,389
I don't believe it.

1195
01:27:34,229 --> 01:27:35,924
That's gold, buddy.

1196
01:27:38,634 --> 01:27:40,966
Are you still going to go back?

1197
01:27:44,273 --> 01:27:46,173
Give me this. Go get everyone.

1198
01:27:46,241 --> 01:27:47,970
Look at them! Guys!

1199
01:27:51,513 --> 01:27:53,447
We're going to be rich!

1200
01:28:06,595 --> 01:28:09,758
'"Come and get me. Come and get me.'"

1201
01:28:21,276 --> 01:28:24,837
This could be it.
There's an entrance to a cave. Come on.

1202
01:28:28,984 --> 01:28:30,645
Come on, let's go.

1203
01:28:38,393 --> 01:28:40,122
I can't believe it.

1204
01:28:46,802 --> 01:28:49,532
- Where's the stuff?
- Get it. Put it down.

1205
01:28:57,946 --> 01:28:59,641
Where do we go now?

1206
01:28:59,715 --> 01:29:03,708
I'll bet that's what was
on the corner of the map that's missing.

1207
01:29:05,521 --> 01:29:07,819
What's the matter, Duke?
Do you see something?

1208
01:29:07,890 --> 01:29:09,050
Quiet.

1209
01:29:09,992 --> 01:29:12,222
My daddy was in this cave.

1210
01:29:13,529 --> 01:29:15,793
- How can you tell?
- I just can.

1211
01:29:16,398 --> 01:29:19,856
Sure, like we could always tell
when our dad had been in the bathroom.

1212
01:29:20,769 --> 01:29:22,532
There are a lot of passageways.

1213
01:29:23,539 --> 01:29:26,565
- Let's split up and each take one.
- Alone?

1214
01:29:28,710 --> 01:29:30,473
I'll take this one.

1215
01:29:35,250 --> 01:29:36,478
Hey, Mitch...

1216
01:29:36,752 --> 01:29:40,017
what if the cave is booby-trapped?

1217
01:29:40,889 --> 01:29:45,155
You go down the wrong passageway
and you get your head chopped off?

1218
01:29:45,561 --> 01:29:49,019
Or a huge boulder comes rolling at you,
and it crushes your head?

1219
01:29:49,097 --> 01:29:51,065
Would you shut up? Stop it!

1220
01:29:51,133 --> 01:29:54,034
Why did you have to say
something like that?

1221
01:29:55,537 --> 01:29:59,029
Look at this. There's three tunnels.
What do we do now?

1222
01:30:02,778 --> 01:30:05,508
Okay, Glen, take the one in the middle.

1223
01:30:05,981 --> 01:30:07,471
I'll take this one...

1224
01:30:07,549 --> 01:30:09,517
and you take that. Okay?

1225
01:31:16,718 --> 01:31:19,084
Will you guys shut up?

1226
01:31:33,001 --> 01:31:34,696
Don't do that now.

1227
01:31:40,208 --> 01:31:42,199
Come on!

1228
01:31:42,277 --> 01:31:43,608
Thank you.

1229
01:32:52,848 --> 01:32:54,247
- Find anything?
- No, you?

1230
01:32:54,316 --> 01:32:55,977
Yeah, I found you.

1231
01:33:00,055 --> 01:33:02,285
- Can you hear something?
- Yeah.

1232
01:33:02,591 --> 01:33:04,525
It sounds like a train.

1233
01:33:04,860 --> 01:33:06,122
A train?

1234
01:33:06,228 --> 01:33:08,560
Hey, look, there's some tracks.

1235
01:33:19,441 --> 01:33:21,966
- Is something coming?
- I don't know.

1236
01:33:23,311 --> 01:33:25,040
Here's how you tell.

1237
01:33:30,519 --> 01:33:32,316
What are you doing?

1238
01:33:32,387 --> 01:33:34,582
I'm listening for vibrations.

1239
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:40,819
Yeah, something's coming.

1240
01:33:44,566 --> 01:33:47,660
And it's definitely coming
from that direction.

1241
01:34:00,415 --> 01:34:01,382
That was Mitch.

1242
01:34:13,895 --> 01:34:15,362
Are you okay?

1243
01:34:16,731 --> 01:34:18,995
- I'm all right.
- Where are you?

1244
01:34:20,168 --> 01:34:22,534
- Follow the tracks.
- I got it.

1245
01:34:52,367 --> 01:34:53,527
Hello.

1246
01:35:14,856 --> 01:35:16,255
I found it.

1247
01:35:17,359 --> 01:35:18,758
I found it.

1248
01:35:20,829 --> 01:35:21,887
Guys!

1249
01:35:22,364 --> 01:35:23,991
I found the gold.

1250
01:35:28,837 --> 01:35:32,000
'"Man, what a gold rush. I found the gold.

1251
01:35:32,073 --> 01:35:34,667
'"It's mine, I tell you. It's all my gold.

1252
01:35:34,910 --> 01:35:38,937
'"We don't have to show him
no stinking badges. I found the gold! '"

1253
01:35:40,649 --> 01:35:42,014
Down here!

1254
01:35:44,052 --> 01:35:46,782
- Where is it?
- He found it?

1255
01:35:46,855 --> 01:35:48,345
Guys, I found the gold!

1256
01:35:48,423 --> 01:35:49,947
Let me see it!

1257
01:36:00,735 --> 01:36:02,703
Can I just say one thing?

1258
01:36:02,771 --> 01:36:04,102
We're rich!

1259
01:36:10,645 --> 01:36:12,613
We did it!

1260
01:36:13,181 --> 01:36:15,206
What the hell is going on?

1261
01:36:15,884 --> 01:36:18,478
Duke, we found it! We found the gold.

1262
01:36:19,654 --> 01:36:20,916
You did?

1263
01:36:21,756 --> 01:36:24,782
- Over here, Duke.
- Holy shit!

1264
01:36:28,363 --> 01:36:30,524
You found the gold? Holy...

1265
01:36:40,609 --> 01:36:44,602
Stand back, boys.
It is time for the Walter Huston dance.

1266
01:36:47,983 --> 01:36:51,680
- Hey, Duke, no more happy pirate.
- That's right, no more.

1267
01:36:53,555 --> 01:36:56,319
You believe this guy?
Last night he wouldn't even hug me!

1268
01:36:56,391 --> 01:36:58,188
See how the money makes a difference?

1269
01:37:05,934 --> 01:37:08,732
Let's go get the burros
and start loading this stuff up.

1270
01:37:08,803 --> 01:37:10,464
Stop right there.

1271
01:37:10,605 --> 01:37:13,506
Did you really think
we'd let you take the gold out of here?

1272
01:37:13,575 --> 01:37:16,339
- Thanks for doing all the work.
- I don't believe this.

1273
01:37:16,411 --> 01:37:19,380
- How the hell did you follow us, Pig-boy?
- Never mind that.

1274
01:37:19,447 --> 01:37:23,144
It's our gold now,
and I'm afraid we can't leave witnesses.

1275
01:37:37,265 --> 01:37:40,234
Get the gun! Quick!

1276
01:37:56,051 --> 01:37:57,211
Mitch!

1277
01:37:58,486 --> 01:37:59,578
Glen!

1278
01:38:17,138 --> 01:38:19,436
It's better this way, isn't it?

1279
01:38:19,708 --> 01:38:22,199
It's better it's me instead of you.

1280
01:38:22,577 --> 01:38:25,239
This way Barbara and the kids...

1281
01:38:28,650 --> 01:38:31,118
I'm sorry I wasn't a good brother.

1282
01:38:31,553 --> 01:38:33,077
No, I'm sorry.

1283
01:38:33,755 --> 01:38:38,351
Don't worry, we'll get some help.
Hold on, we'll get some help, you'll see.

1284
01:38:38,727 --> 01:38:40,627
Somebody get some help!

1285
01:38:41,262 --> 01:38:42,752
Get some help!

1286
01:38:43,698 --> 01:38:46,189
It's okay. You always helped me.

1287
01:38:47,836 --> 01:38:49,861
You took me to the movies.

1288
01:38:51,940 --> 01:38:53,339
It's funny...

1289
01:38:53,942 --> 01:38:55,739
it doesn't even hurt.

1290
01:38:57,846 --> 01:38:58,938
Glen?

1291
01:39:15,263 --> 01:39:19,996
You killed him! You son of a bitch!
You killed my best friend's brother!

1292
01:39:23,471 --> 01:39:27,168
These aren't real bullets. These are blanks.

1293
01:39:28,209 --> 01:39:29,335
What?

1294
01:39:33,114 --> 01:39:34,775
These are blanks.

1295
01:39:35,183 --> 01:39:36,309
Here.

1296
01:39:37,485 --> 01:39:40,147
- It's paint!
- What the hell is going on?

1297
01:39:41,222 --> 01:39:43,349
- That's funny!
- Yeah, real funny.

1298
01:39:44,426 --> 01:39:46,291
Hey, who's down there?

1299
01:39:48,797 --> 01:39:52,358
What in the name of John Wayne's ass
is going on in here?

1300
01:39:52,767 --> 01:39:55,531
Clay Stone? From the cattle drive?

1301
01:39:55,937 --> 01:39:58,633
I remember you two. What are you doing?

1302
01:40:02,010 --> 01:40:04,069
Great buckets of bullshit!

1303
01:40:05,313 --> 01:40:07,577
It's Curly, come back to life.

1304
01:40:08,183 --> 01:40:10,708
I'm not Curly, I'm his brother, Duke.

1305
01:40:10,852 --> 01:40:12,444
Who the hell are you?

1306
01:40:12,520 --> 01:40:15,512
I'm Clay Stone.
Hell, I've been looking for you for months.

1307
01:40:16,958 --> 01:40:19,654
- What did you do to my boys?
- Your boys?

1308
01:40:20,061 --> 01:40:23,588
- What happened? We heard shots.
- Is everybody all right?

1309
01:40:24,132 --> 01:40:26,123
Ira and Barry Shalowitz?

1310
01:40:26,768 --> 01:40:28,668
Mitch? Phil?

1311
01:40:30,438 --> 01:40:31,905
What are you doing here?

1312
01:40:31,973 --> 01:40:35,841
Oh, God, it's Curly!
He's come back from the dead.

1313
01:40:35,910 --> 01:40:37,400
He looks great.

1314
01:40:37,479 --> 01:40:39,572
It's Duke, Curly's brother.

1315
01:40:39,647 --> 01:40:41,979
Will somebody please...

1316
01:40:42,150 --> 01:40:44,175
tell me what the hell is going on here?

1317
01:40:44,252 --> 01:40:46,482
- Didn't Curly tell you?
- No!

1318
01:40:46,554 --> 01:40:48,078
Hell, it was his idea.

1319
01:40:48,156 --> 01:40:50,954
We take folks
on a real Western treasure hunt.

1320
01:40:51,025 --> 01:40:53,926
Follow right in the steps
of the old Washburn gang.

1321
01:40:53,995 --> 01:40:56,964
Yeah, we get these maps,
and we follow these clues...

1322
01:40:57,031 --> 01:40:58,760
It's been exciting.

1323
01:40:59,501 --> 01:41:00,661
It's been great.

1324
01:41:00,735 --> 01:41:03,033
Better than those cattle drives. Yes, sir-ee.

1325
01:41:04,439 --> 01:41:07,033
More fun. You don't have
to watch where you step.

1326
01:41:07,108 --> 01:41:10,236
Yeah, but we actually found it.

1327
01:41:10,311 --> 01:41:13,109
Yes, and it belongs to us.

1328
01:41:13,181 --> 01:41:14,341
What, that?

1329
01:41:14,415 --> 01:41:18,010
Everybody finds that.
Hell, that's just lead painted with gold.

1330
01:41:18,086 --> 01:41:20,714
Just to make it a little bit more fun.

1331
01:41:21,489 --> 01:41:23,480
Take a look for yourself.

1332
01:41:27,795 --> 01:41:29,922
Then, to give it extra goose...

1333
01:41:29,998 --> 01:41:32,330
the boys come in, pretend to rob them...

1334
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:34,595
and shoot them with paint pellets.

1335
01:41:34,669 --> 01:41:36,864
Scares the Evian out of them.

1336
01:41:40,341 --> 01:41:42,571
Then there's no real treasure?

1337
01:41:43,711 --> 01:41:47,203
Curly came up here a lot of times,
but he never found anything.

1338
01:41:47,282 --> 01:41:49,876
But he wrote to me,
said we were going to be rich.

1339
01:41:49,951 --> 01:41:53,216
I don't know about being rich,
but you make a damn good living.

1340
01:41:53,288 --> 01:41:55,222
He wanted to cut you in for a piece.

1341
01:41:55,290 --> 01:41:57,850
As far as I'm concerned,
you can have his share.

1342
01:42:01,329 --> 01:42:03,126
That's what he meant?

1343
01:42:04,198 --> 01:42:05,665
I believe so.

1344
01:42:09,871 --> 01:42:13,432
You boys came up here
thinking that this was real?

1345
01:42:20,214 --> 01:42:21,203
Yeah.

1346
01:42:25,553 --> 01:42:27,487
Unbelievable.

1347
01:42:37,065 --> 01:42:39,158
Un-by-God-believable!

1348
01:42:43,071 --> 01:42:44,732
- Ready?
- I'm wound.

1349
01:42:49,844 --> 01:42:51,106
I got it.

1350
01:42:53,414 --> 01:42:55,678
We're Barry and Ira Shalowitz.

1351
01:42:58,086 --> 01:43:00,213
We helped bury your brother.

1352
01:43:03,157 --> 01:43:05,887
Maybe someday I can do the same for you.

1353
01:43:11,232 --> 01:43:13,496
Well, it was nice meeting you.

1354
01:43:15,937 --> 01:43:18,667
You start a conversation with,
'"We buried your brother'"?

1355
01:43:18,740 --> 01:43:21,072
- I was flustered.
- It's impolite.

1356
01:43:21,142 --> 01:43:23,975
Come on, let's get a cold beverage and...

1357
01:43:24,045 --> 01:43:25,842
- Going somewhere?
- No.

1358
01:43:27,348 --> 01:43:31,648
I'll take Clay's sons down
and show them where we left our horses.

1359
01:43:31,719 --> 01:43:33,243
We'll help you.

1360
01:43:33,321 --> 01:43:36,154
I can do it.
You guys got to go to Las Vegas.

1361
01:43:36,224 --> 01:43:38,249
I don't got to go nowhere.

1362
01:43:42,063 --> 01:43:45,328
What are you going to do, Duke?
Work for Clay Stone?

1363
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:49,234
Come up here every week
and find a fake treasure? No, thanks.

1364
01:43:52,740 --> 01:43:54,537
So what will you do?

1365
01:43:55,410 --> 01:43:56,843
That gold...

1366
01:43:58,346 --> 01:44:00,610
That gold is up here somewhere.

1367
01:44:00,682 --> 01:44:03,207
- Duke...
- No, it's up here somewhere.

1368
01:44:09,223 --> 01:44:10,690
Thanks for...

1369
01:44:10,858 --> 01:44:12,917
being Curly's last friend.

1370
01:44:13,695 --> 01:44:15,424
It was my pleasure.

1371
01:44:16,297 --> 01:44:17,821
Okay, come on.

1372
01:44:18,166 --> 01:44:19,690
Come on, baby.

1373
01:44:23,337 --> 01:44:26,829
Did Curly ever tell you
what that one thing was?

1374
01:44:28,776 --> 01:44:32,303
He said that's what
you have to figure out for yourself.

1375
01:44:34,949 --> 01:44:36,007
God.

1376
01:44:36,551 --> 01:44:39,384
He was a real pain in the ass, wasn't he?

1377
01:44:56,871 --> 01:44:59,135
- About five minutes.
- Good.

1378
01:44:59,874 --> 01:45:02,035
Well, how stupid do we feel?

1379
01:45:02,810 --> 01:45:04,801
I don't feel that stupid.

1380
01:45:05,346 --> 01:45:08,509
- Then you're stupid.
- No, I'm confused.

1381
01:45:10,151 --> 01:45:13,086
- Why don't I feel worse?
- I don't know.

1382
01:45:14,489 --> 01:45:16,650
Think about it for a second.

1383
01:45:17,058 --> 01:45:19,151
How bad do you really feel?

1384
01:45:22,396 --> 01:45:25,490
I don't know.
You know, not as bad as I should.

1385
01:45:28,302 --> 01:45:30,497
I feel pretty good, actually.

1386
01:45:31,806 --> 01:45:33,239
Why is that?

1387
01:45:34,008 --> 01:45:36,374
Well, we had a great adventure...

1388
01:45:36,444 --> 01:45:39,504
we weren't killed,
which is always a feature I like.

1389
01:45:39,580 --> 01:45:43,107
- And we found a box full of lead.
- That's not how I look at it.

1390
01:45:43,184 --> 01:45:45,482
I mean, you guys saved my life.

1391
01:45:46,954 --> 01:45:49,752
I mean, you stepped in front of a bullet.

1392
01:45:50,858 --> 01:45:53,452
You jumped on a guy
who was ready to shoot me.

1393
01:45:53,528 --> 01:45:56,520
- They were blanks.
- But you didn't know that.

1394
01:45:56,597 --> 01:45:59,566
We didn't have any guided tour
or box lunches.

1395
01:45:59,634 --> 01:46:01,864
All we had was each other.

1396
01:46:03,237 --> 01:46:04,829
And we made it.

1397
01:46:05,373 --> 01:46:06,465
Me...

1398
01:46:06,774 --> 01:46:08,435
my best friend...

1399
01:46:10,311 --> 01:46:11,835
and my brother.

1400
01:46:14,215 --> 01:46:16,513
We found the Washburn treasure!

1401
01:46:17,919 --> 01:46:19,216
We did it.

1402
01:46:20,555 --> 01:46:22,284
We found that gold!

1403
01:46:24,125 --> 01:46:25,592
Philly-boy...

1404
01:46:26,093 --> 01:46:27,583
you did great.

1405
01:46:29,030 --> 01:46:30,190
Thanks.

1406
01:46:38,606 --> 01:46:40,574
I'm really proud of you.

1407
01:47:22,383 --> 01:47:24,317
God, look at this town!

1408
01:47:25,419 --> 01:47:27,649
Filled with desperate people.

1409
01:47:29,423 --> 01:47:31,789
Why do you think they come here?

1410
01:47:31,859 --> 01:47:36,387
Well, the buffets are lovely.
There's $3.95 all-you-can-eat.

1411
01:47:36,464 --> 01:47:39,160
They want to hit the jackpot, get rich.

1412
01:47:41,035 --> 01:47:43,799
Listen, I feel bad for you, I really do.

1413
01:47:43,871 --> 01:47:47,432
But could we talk about this later?
Maybe have a drink together?

1414
01:47:47,508 --> 01:47:50,636
My wife is coming in from the airport
right now.

1415
01:47:50,711 --> 01:47:52,303
I told her everything...

1416
01:47:52,380 --> 01:47:55,872
and I planned this fabulous evening
of being yelled at.

1417
01:47:56,050 --> 01:47:57,540
I understand.

1418
01:47:57,718 --> 01:48:00,050
I came back...

1419
01:48:01,222 --> 01:48:03,816
to tell you that I know what this is.

1420
01:48:07,561 --> 01:48:09,085
It's honesty...

1421
01:48:10,498 --> 01:48:11,988
integrity.

1422
01:48:13,501 --> 01:48:15,264
Great, that's great.

1423
01:48:15,336 --> 01:48:17,896
So, listen, thanks for scaring me...

1424
01:48:17,972 --> 01:48:19,462
and maybe...

1425
01:48:20,141 --> 01:48:21,403
Honesty.

1426
01:48:24,412 --> 01:48:25,640
Gotcha.

1427
01:48:30,584 --> 01:48:32,245
You know, Mitch...

1428
01:48:32,486 --> 01:48:34,477
right down to the end...

1429
01:48:36,457 --> 01:48:39,585
I was planning
to cheat you and your friends.

1430
01:48:44,098 --> 01:48:46,396
I was going to find the gold...

1431
01:48:46,467 --> 01:48:48,992
then I was going to say I didn't find it...

1432
01:48:49,070 --> 01:48:51,504
and after you guys had gone,
I was going...

1433
01:48:51,572 --> 01:48:55,008
I was going to have it all, all to myself.

1434
01:48:56,777 --> 01:48:57,971
Only...

1435
01:48:59,613 --> 01:49:01,240
I couldn't do it.

1436
01:49:01,315 --> 01:49:03,647
Of course not, because it isn't up there.

1437
01:49:03,718 --> 01:49:05,948
- Yes, it is.
- No, it isn't.

1438
01:49:06,220 --> 01:49:08,484
Curly was up there a million times.

1439
01:49:08,556 --> 01:49:09,989
My mother...

1440
01:49:10,057 --> 01:49:13,288
didn't want either of us
to find that treasure without the other.

1441
01:49:13,361 --> 01:49:16,694
She wanted her boys
to do something together.

1442
01:49:19,867 --> 01:49:22,358
So she gave Curly the map...

1443
01:49:25,906 --> 01:49:27,396
Wait a minute.

1444
01:49:32,079 --> 01:49:34,377
She sent me the missing corner.

1445
01:49:38,919 --> 01:49:40,079
There.

1446
01:49:40,154 --> 01:49:41,644
Look at that.

1447
01:49:49,530 --> 01:49:51,157
'"Hot on my trail.

1448
01:49:51,632 --> 01:49:53,463
'"Re-buried here, 1909.

1449
01:49:55,269 --> 01:49:56,759
'"L. Washburn.'"

1450
01:50:00,641 --> 01:50:02,734
Did you draw this yourself?

1451
01:50:02,810 --> 01:50:04,607
Is that what you did?

1452
01:50:05,413 --> 01:50:09,008
You prankster. You scamp.
You little ruffian.

1453
01:50:09,083 --> 01:50:12,780
Forget it. I'm not going back up there.
There's nothing there.

1454
01:50:12,853 --> 01:50:17,256
I'm through hunting for treasure.
What am I, one of the Little Rascals?

1455
01:50:21,362 --> 01:50:23,853
What do you think of that, Spanky?

1456
01:50:26,967 --> 01:50:28,298
This is...

1457
01:50:34,842 --> 01:50:36,776
It's got friends.

1458
01:50:42,917 --> 01:50:45,579
'"Come and get me. Come and get me.'"
