1
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,397
Three rows of pearls
roll down our cheeks

2
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,273
Rows of pearls
or strings of tears

3
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,794
Roll in our hearts
left to weep

4
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,312
Shoot up to the sun,
lighting up the sky

5
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,989
Your fair-haired angels
one day will know

6
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,799
That our queen

7
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,152
was you

8
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,029
What will they do
without their mom?

9
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,556
And what of us,
sitting here alone and dumb?

10
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,595
And what of them,
full of certainties

11
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,349
And what of you,
up there in the moon?

12
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,556
Why always the same souls?

13
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,791
Why take those
who do what's right?

14
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,196
Why take those

15
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,348
who bind us tight?

16
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,154
Three rows of tears

17
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,111
around your fair neck

18
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,755
Why always the same souls?

19
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,876
Why take those
who do what's right?

20
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,792
Why take those
who bind us tight?

21
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,358
Rows of pearls or...

22
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,351
strings of tears

23
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,511
ARMELE, I LOVE YOU

24
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,314
- Hearts are trumps.
- Two no trumps.

25
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,112
Armelle, let it rip.

26
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,669
Pass.

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,399
Check out that babe.

28
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,035
- Bow-legged.
- Yeah, you're right.

29
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,073
Wait, let me help.

30
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,193
It is heavy.

31
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,870
I need my crossword.

32
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,354
I'll get it for you.

33
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,636
I'd rather do it myself.

34
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,119
Armelle's a one-woman
senior center!

35
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,749
- Can I put it up now?
- Go ahead.

36
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,872
That's not nice. Stop it.

37
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,235
Funny.

38
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,955
Armelle, why'd you trump the club?

39
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,549
To let you finesse against the king.

40
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,950
Never mind.
I'm going to take a leak.

41
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,517
Ask the slut
if she has a crewneck.

42
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,988
Crewneck or V-neck?

43
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,191
Crew. V-necks are faggy.

44
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,119
Yeah, you're right.
That's what I have.

45
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,029
How is it?

46
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,314
I don't get their sizes,
or their accents.

47
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,357
In the States I have no problem.

48
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,279
Even the ten is too big.

49
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,629
- A little small?
- No, it's great.

50
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,432
You're right, I'll take it.

51
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,918
Hello, Gilbert Butcher's.

52
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,356
Yes, hold on. One second.

53
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,469
Of course.

54
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,638
What is it with you?

55
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,439
You're out of your mind.

56
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,634
Are you naked?

57
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,270
A bra? Which one?

58
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,033
Blue with white polka dots.

59
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,834
Laurence, I found
a camel one in size 8.

60
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,916
- Here.
- Great.

61
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,192
The chestnut is the last one.
They can have one sent over.

62
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,919
Only takes 15 minutes.

63
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,839
I don't want to wait.
We're going shoe-hunting.

64
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,113
Hey Mel, got something nice?

65
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,072
Laurence found two great ones.

66
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,998
- What?
- Sweaters.

67
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,271
Hang on, let me handle this.
I mean we're buying so much.

68
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,115
Freebie?

69
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,595
No sense of salesmanship.

70
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,474
Well, I do.

71
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,709
It's a nice view.

72
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,992
80 pounds for Aussie wine.
These limeys have some nerve.

73
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,316
- The key...
- I'm loaded.

74
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,239
What can we give them?
Chili con carne.

75
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,477
No, 8 is too late. 6:30's better!
Lend me a pen.

76
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,636
You don't do it right.

77
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,271
You have to wait
for the green light.

78
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,312
Quiet! People are sleeping.

79
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,516
Titi, scotch?

80
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,709
Sure.

81
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,794
Laurence...

82
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,633
Cherry Schweppes?

83
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,875
Yuk.

84
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,239
Little dessert?

85
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,028
Hysterical.

86
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,271
How can you stand him?

87
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,912
I'm not sleepy at all.
Wish we had a joint.

88
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,029
Could you lend me a nightgown?
I forgot mine.

89
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,470
And I hate sleeping in the nude.

90
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,079
I have pajamas.

91
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,835
Way too big for me.
OK, I'll make do.

92
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,913
There we go.

93
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,998
I wouldn't dare, with customs.

94
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,237
You shouldn't.
But no one cares about me.

95
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,476
No one cares about Arnaud.

96
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,360
If they nabbed Alban,
that would be sticky.

97
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,711
I can't picture your uptight brother
smoking a joint.

98
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,275
Watch it, he's the heir
to the throne.

99
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,871
Titi, did you take my Omega 3?

100
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,432
- What's that?
- Oh, great.

101
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,908
Good stuff.

102
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,229
Hey, Mellie!

103
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,513
Laurence was such a pain all day.

104
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,311
Deep down you like her.

105
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,829
Are you naked?

106
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,270
I lent Laurence my pajamas.

107
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,878
Turn over, my love.

108
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,840
- Wort have a son like that.
- That's for sure.

109
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,508
- Think of your mom.
- The hell with her.

110
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,393
Come on, be a dear.
Just this once.

111
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,676
That can't be.
My father died in '92.

112
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,555
What?

113
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,113
But how?

114
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,434
Actually, we switched rooms.

115
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,310
Have you tried his cell?
I can give you the number.

116
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,999
I'll take care of it.

117
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,919
You can count on me.

118
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,439
The fucking light!

119
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,040
André died
while we were eating out.

120
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,714
André... André?

121
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,438
Shit. How?

122
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,200
Helicopter accident.
After a ski trip.

123
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,834
His guide, too.
They're both dead.

124
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,357
Died instantly.
Only Alban got out unscathed.

125
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,319
I have to tell Arnaud.

126
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,909
What's his room number?
Is it 505?

127
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,348
No, we're 505.

128
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,077
Was our old room 506?

129
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,639
It's across the hall.

130
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,829
Would you go?

131
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,315
Why should I?

132
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,271
It's a woman's thing.
When Rex died, you told the kids.

133
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,669
Not the same thing.

134
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,716
It is, sort of.

135
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,871
He's not my old schoolmate.

136
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,670
Am I waking you?

137
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,031
Yes. What's the matter?

138
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,873
They called my room.

139
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,038
Reception has you in our room,
that's why.

140
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,549
Cut to the chase.

141
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,195
Your dad had a health issue
in a chopper.

142
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,196
What issue?

143
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,516
I don't know.

144
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,833
That's all they told me.
You're to go to the military airport.

145
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,229
Is it serious?

146
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,036
Yeah, I guess. A little.

147
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,676
I really don't have any details.
But Alban's fine.

148
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,997
I spoke to an English lady,
then someone else...

149
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,869
No baggage?

150
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,590
We left close friends behind.
They'll handle all that.

151
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,239
Hope it's not serious.

152
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,789
And that it's not permanent.

153
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,633
He's so athletic.

154
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,715
Well...

155
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,831
I hope your journey is as pleasant
as possible in the circumstances.

156
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,914
Thank you for coming out tonight.
This ruins a weekend.

157
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,797
No, really...

158
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,319
You're very kind.

159
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,072
Arnie, give me your passport.

160
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,113
That's not necessary.

161
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,914
Well then,

162
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,796
unfortunately, we will be seeing
each other on Saturday.

163
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,717
What's on for Saturday?

164
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,675
Well...

165
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,599
the interment.

166
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,752
Not easy being the eldest.

167
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,076
Taking over the family business...

168
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,708
He had so much left to teach me.

169
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,957
Didn't Daphne come?

170
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,955
If you're hungry, boys...
gentlemen,

171
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,833
there are some refreshments
in the pantry.

172
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,871
Sandwiches, crackers.

173
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,752
Thank you, Marie-Pierre.

174
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,952
She still has that wart.
I'd forgotten.

175
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,592
She wasn't so stiff
when she brought my snack.

176
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,037
Daphne couldn't make it?

177
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,397
I'm going to the pantry.

178
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,795
I haven't eaten since the accident.

179
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,149
I'd better have my bandage changed.

180
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,599
You see, Armelle,

181
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,800
even at 62, he was still my baby.

182
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,069
Of course.

183
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,514
He was so cute, so supple.

184
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,314
You could twist him all around.

185
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,597
Made his little poop
every day at the same time,

186
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,074
like clockwork.

187
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,633
How nice.

188
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,914
Mom, didn't Daphne come?

189
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,277
She left him last week.

190
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,556
No one knows it yet.

191
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,149
I thought she'd be back, but...

192
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,874
I hear she's found
someone new, in Spain.

193
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,672
She seemed perfect.

194
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,918
What can I tell you?
He never could keep them.

195
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,839
And the nose won't help matters.

196
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,911
Would it be possible, Arnaud,
to meet with you about 10 AM...

197
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,156
Monday in the little anteroom
behind the smoking room?

198
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,277
Oh, sure. No problem.

199
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,914
Is 10 too early for you, Arnaud?

200
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,678
No, not at all.

201
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,233
Praise the Lord.

202
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:22,672
While, in private, Queen Eugenia
grieves at the fallen king's side,

203
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,230
a few subjects of the crown,
stricken by last night's news,

204
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,478
have very discreetly come

205
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,917
to lend her their support
and express their love

206
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,351
for one who, over 35 years,
understood them so well.

207
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,150
King André died in an accident
last night at 8:10

208
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,511
after climbing one of the mountains
he loved so well.

209
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,990
Exiting the royal residence now

210
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,909
is Alban, very close to his father,
also at the accident

211
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,351
and miraculously saved
by the sandwiches on his lap.

212
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,915
This discreet, thoughtful prince

213
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,192
is prematurely called
to succeed his father.

214
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,630
Alban, our future king.

215
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,759
Here's his younger brother, Arnaud,
his wife, Armelle,

216
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,758
with her father,
Count van de Couque.

217
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,150
A family, a nation, a kingdom

218
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,158
stricken with the loss
of a beloved monarch.

219
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,757
At St Eloi Cathedral
funeral preparations are underway.

220
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,875
The Cathedral will welcome
leaders from the world over

221
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,356
come to pay their respects
to this private man,

222
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,676
this good and simple king.

223
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,150
Come to Grandpa. That's enough.

224
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,314
Come wash,
you dirty little girl.

225
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,078
Come to Grandpa.

226
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,957
Come take a 'ath
with Grandpa in the 'athtu'.

227
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,792
Or Grandpa will 'eat you.

228
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,315
See? I told you,

229
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,317
she can't say "b" anymore.

230
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,239
Her teacher sent me.
I thought it was silliness.

231
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,509
For starters, you'd better
keep Bérangére on weekends.

232
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,072
Even before treatment.

233
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,795
She can visit her grandparents,
but only for lunch.

234
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,510
Tell them she goes swimming
on Saturday evenings now.

235
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,913
I think it's better,
for now in any case.

236
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,075
Can they visit?

237
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,909
Excuse me.

238
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,999
Your prison visit!

239
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,435
Little Chris is here
with his inhaler.

240
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,990
Bérangére was 25 minutes late!

241
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:24,319
Dylan's dad brought you a ham.
Should I give it to Karima?

242
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,959
Christine, it's pork.

243
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,349
Oh, that's right.

244
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,429
Hi.

245
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,798
Oh, right, I get it.

246
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,679
Let's not waste time.

247
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,110
So that's how it's going to be?

248
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,072
Seven years of geopolitics,

249
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,511
summers in college
instead of reading comics.

250
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,233
What did I ever do?

251
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,319
Not my fault Daphne's sunbathing
on that idiot's yacht.

252
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,353
I loved her.
Why didn't she come back?

253
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,508
A future king!

254
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,792
Get a grip.
You can't be seen like this. Go hide.

255
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,673
I'm still asleep.
Signing papers at 10 AM!

256
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,711
No time to get my drawers on.

257
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,317
I don't deserve this!

258
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,276
Honey, sit down
and listen to René-Guy.

259
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,159
Dear Arnaud,

260
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,433
despite the sorrow
we all share today,

261
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:26,318
as you know, we must think
of your father's succession.

262
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,470
Your brother Alban has always had

263
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,276
some trouble retaining
his hypothetical fiancées.

264
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,998
We thought it best that you,
however unprepared you may be,

265
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,270
leap into the breach

266
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,552
and take the place
which had been meant for him.

267
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,872
- Me?
- Yes, you, Arnaud.

268
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,199
The Charter, dating from Calixte I,
is quite clear on this point.

269
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,115
"Let none claimeth by any right
the crown and scepter's might

270
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,798
"if no petticoat be in sight."
It's crystal-clear.

271
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,915
It happened once before, in 1458,
at the death of Eloi the Vigorous.

272
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,749
The younger Alibert
replaced the unbetrothed Ambroise.

273
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:13,873
Alas, in that case,
the kingdom was the worse for it,

274
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,753
but we are quite confident,
praise the Lord,

275
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,315
that won't be the case with you.

276
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,755
We're certain. I have no doubt.

277
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,070
Some remembrances of your father.

278
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,311
I couldn't even look.

279
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,914
One thing. I've heard a rumor...

280
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,031
that there's been a little...

281
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,795
marijuana going around your home.

282
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,956
You understand that, from now on...

283
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,709
Oh right, but it's not me.
That's Armelle.

284
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,069
I'll talk to her.

285
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,029
Fine.

286
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,833
So lovely,
these strokes and flourishes...

287
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,871
What are those glasses?

288
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,358
I'm 6-0 in the left eye.

289
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,398
I've had trouble reading.
I need glasses now.

290
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,069
Stinks of wine.

291
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,838
I drove a bum to the pool.

292
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,429
He slept in the car
while I was shopping.

293
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,757
You're driving bums
to the pool now!

294
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,838
Not enough with stutterers,
jail visits,

295
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,833
idiot immigrants,
and not locking your car?

296
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,077
Enough bull!
"Kind" doesn't rhyme with "cretin"!

297
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,755
We have to talk.

298
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,992
I had a totally big meeting
with Mom and René-Guy.

299
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,194
Much better, thanks.

300
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,031
Since I started calligraphy,
I've found a certain serenity.

301
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,471
It does me the world of good.

302
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,755
Do some every day?

303
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,955
Not every day.

304
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,879
Yesterday, I did a big P.
So relaxing.

305
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,432
Getting back to the point,
I'd like this to go quickly.

306
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,112
Your little dentist job has to go.

307
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,351
- Speech therapist.
- Right, sorry.

308
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,759
You'll have no time for that.
It must take concentration.

309
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,029
Yes, of course.

310
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,311
Arnaud has the right stuff.

311
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,557
I don't say that
because we get along so well.

312
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,309
What can I say?
It's this damned charter.

313
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,748
I was glad Arnaud reacted so well.
It can't be easy.

314
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,956
It can't be easy for Alban.

315
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,916
Yes, but what can you do?
With his extra testicle...

316
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,069
I've been honest.

317
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,993
I always warned his girlfriends
in advance.

318
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,394
Who knows why they run?

319
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,714
My "three strands" are yours.

320
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,997
I had them when the boys were born.
Still perfect.

321
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,432
Pearls come in handy.
Must wear them, or they die.

322
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,279
Here, try it on.

323
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,999
There's a safety catch.

324
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,234
Wait, let me help.

325
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,911
You might touch up your hair.

326
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,108
Just so it looks a little tidier.

327
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,471
You're fine in your way.
Maybe something neater.

328
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,997
That's nice. Very nice.

329
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,390
Of course, not with green, but...

330
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,389
Speaking of green,
I hope you've completely stopped...

331
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,912
You know... the dope smoking.

332
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,674
I'm known for my casual style,
but I don't like that much.

333
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,039
Oh, and I found this
in Health magazine.

334
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,468
A diet for having boys.

335
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,870
I copied it.
It's supposed to work.

336
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,680
I never had any problems.
Eat salty foods,

337
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,353
no dairy.

338
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,670
Or very little.
Read it later.

339
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,669
Rudy! Flopsy!

340
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,713
Sorry. They always do that
with strangers.

341
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,831
René-Guy, come in.

342
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,512
Well, Armelle.

343
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,839
We've filled your schedule
for the next 3 months.

344
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:11,795
Our apologies for minor changes
to be made, with your input,

345
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,359
on a daily basis.

346
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,990
We've canceled your patients.

347
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,996
From now on, you will have

348
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,589
much more amusing things to do.

349
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,075
Blow.

350
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,396
Harder, honey. Harder.

351
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,120
With the queen,
our future sovereigns

352
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,232
Arnaud and his wife, Armelle.

353
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,989
Arnaud, unemployed,
polo enthusiast, will succeed André,

354
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,237
replacing Alban,
sadly unwed when tragedy struck.

355
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,591
The coronation will take place
after the mourning period.

356
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,438
Alban's still not married.

357
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,034
Why?

358
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,959
I don't know.

359
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:37,998
It's my pleasure to introduce
His Royal Highness Prince Arnaud,

360
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,637
who will honor us by inaugurating
the Jean Bourdieu Library,

361
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,355
which his father would be proud
to see completed.

362
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,675
Your Highness.

363
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,440
To remember Jean Bourdieu

364
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,392
is to evoke a monument.

365
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:06,798
Who better than this great poet
could lend his name to this place

366
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,959
of culture, of discovery and reading?

367
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,914
For a book is a promise.

368
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,872
There are 300,000 promises

369
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,117
now awaiting the patronage

370
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,675
of, we hope, a large public.

371
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,110
In this time of new tech... nologies,

372
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:29,075
when our nation has jumped
on the internet bandwagon

373
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,395
while in motion,

374
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,831
what better than a book
to stop time

375
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,676
and travel through centuries?

376
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,988
However,

377
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,156
rather than long speeches,

378
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,159
allow me to immediately unveil
the plaque

379
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,716
and baptize
this new seat of learning,

380
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,355
this new jewel in our crown.

381
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,874
Majesty!

382
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,514
Over here.

383
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,989
- Very nice.
- Great.

384
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,111
- Like this?
- Very good.

385
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,708
That's good.

386
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,110
He wanted me off the grass.

387
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,393
Dad's not angry.
But those pictures are for his work.

388
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,755
Dad works?

389
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,871
Yes, he does now.

390
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,792
Let's go, girls! Your turn!

391
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,520
Could you smile just a little?

392
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,115
More laid back.

393
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,838
More natural.

394
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,999
Yeah, almost. Better.

395
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,839
Got a pastel color?
Maybe something fresher?

396
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,268
This isn't fresh?

397
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,999
Your husband's right.

398
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,079
Good thinking.

399
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,918
I'll go see in your closets.

400
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,149
I'd rather go.

401
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,278
I need you in the picture.

402
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,350
Don't move.

403
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,232
Weekend, my doggie.

404
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,158
Here, Weekend. Good boy.

405
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,310
Very nice.

406
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,392
I got the same shot in France
with the Sarkozy boy. Nice.

407
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,231
Move, you're blocking the steak.

408
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,833
Looks overcooked.

409
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,150
No, it's fine. Very homey.

410
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:55,589
But could Madam look like
you think it's good?

411
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,430
Like you can't wait to taste it.

412
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,233
What are you doing?

413
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,873
It's for my own pleasure.

414
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,640
No way, quit it right away.

415
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,434
No second camera.
I got the exclusive.

416
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,959
They're my friends.

417
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,748
Forget it.

418
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,751
I can erase them, it's digital.

419
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,030
Great. Do it.

420
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,559
I found a pen.

421
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,148
Take some notes.

422
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,112
You'll have to sign treaties.

423
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,999
Don't look at me.

424
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,998
Just work, like usual.

425
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,076
Armelle!

426
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,675
Get some supplies from the closet.

427
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,349
Coming.

428
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,437
Here, there are sporty ones too.

429
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,871
Armelle, office supplies!
Folders, files.

430
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,798
I'll put them back properly.

431
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,155
Sorry.

432
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,998
- Mistake from my "Big Blue" period.
- It's erasable.

433
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,117
We do incredible stuff now.

434
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,792
I erased the mustache
of the woman who won the lottery.

435
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,830
We can whiten the lady's teeth.
Simple as pie.

436
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,999
Really? Great.

437
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,000
Shake your bootie, we're late.

438
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,669
Not shooting?

439
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,390
No, there'll be thousands
of photographs tonight.

440
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,398
- I got what I need.
- Oh, OK.

441
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,033
Be good with Bricka.

442
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:33,153
After dinner, you can watch
Bugs Bricka... Bunny. Sorry.

443
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,475
That's OK.

444
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,073
Soup all over it!

445
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,674
Unbelievable.

446
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,188
- Not very deft, is she?
- Sure isn't.

447
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,590
You're great, Arnaud, really.

448
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,790
Very sweet, with the girls.

449
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,194
The steak in the kitchen,
very nice. Very homey.

450
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,638
You should be careful.
The detergent on the window sill.

451
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,195
Anyway...

452
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,078
I like the office.

453
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,111
Handsome, dignified.

454
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,032
No, not at all.
You're concentrating on work.

455
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,554
No, you're just fine.

456
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,796
Could I speak to Armelle?

457
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,638
I have two or three tips.

458
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,148
Armelle, it's Mom.

459
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,796
Hello. How are you?

460
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,509
Fine, thanks.
No, of course you're not.

461
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,950
You fixed your heating problem?

462
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,833
Yes, sure.

463
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:44,476
I don't remember. I'll get it.
It's on Arnaud's desk.

464
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,069
Here it is.

465
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,879
Page 38?

466
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,479
Right. Yes. Yes, of course.

467
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,999
More smile.

468
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,432
Oh, page 42.

469
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,275
Yes, right.

470
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,029
I saw that. The reporter...
The photographer was there.

471
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,079
More vases. You're right,
it's more lively.

472
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,036
Yes, he looks good in glasses.

473
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,558
No problem. You too.

474
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,835
Let me see.

475
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,478
Your Majesty,
have some more blood sausage.

476
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,994
A treat in the morning!

477
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,829
Your Highness.

478
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,915
Made entirely from local produce.

479
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,831
Very good.

480
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,514
You won't have some beer?

481
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,356
Thanks anyway,
but I only drink water.

482
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,830
But my wife could have some.

483
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,993
Tasted this one yet?

484
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,390
Finish your glass, Your Majesty.

485
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,039
Never mix.

486
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:04,956
Bottoms up.

487
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,232
Try this one.

488
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,396
More malt,

489
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,598
but less alcohol content
than the last one.

490
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,239
Delicious.

491
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,516
Arnaud! Arnaud! Arnaud!

492
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,711
Gentlemen... Well done.

493
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,551
On your mark, get set...

494
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,995
Jump!

495
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,395
Higher!

496
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,951
Lower! Right!

497
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,188
Practice for next year.

498
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,312
Just picture it. On her back

499
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,949
in the mud
with her bouquet and scarf.

500
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,799
Right, I forgot.
She was blindfolded.

501
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,592
What a disaster.

502
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,556
Ever hear of "Bite the Biscuit?"

503
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,758
It's famous! More up north,
but really, Armelle.

504
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,755
For her first time out,

505
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,839
nice going, Princess.

506
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,479
That isn't nice.

507
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,071
Ass up, like a mud wrestler!

508
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,392
Titi, ice cream?

509
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,511
Looks bad, but I'm hungry.

510
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,030
Not me. I have to drop
ten pounds for my coronation.

511
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,879
At the palace,
I'll have a gym installed.

512
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,678
Titi, roll us a joint?

513
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,315
- You packed?
- Can't find the bathing suits.

514
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,078
We leave at 9:30.

515
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,717
That idiot Henri- Louis
got me an 8:45 for UVs.

516
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,115
Yeah, right. That's too early.

517
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,071
There's a little girl crying.

518
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,514
"Omasoosee."

519
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:40,069
"Omasoosee." What a disaster.
No ear for the lingo.

520
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,677
He's very honored that you're here.
Very honored.

521
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,592
This aquarium was constructed
in 1955. Half a century.

522
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,473
Fish...

523
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:05,355
Even if you don't understand,
you could be a little nicer.

524
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,673
The guy in the green suit.
Not the stupid interpreter.

525
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,429
That just isn't done.

526
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,629
Fine, alright.

527
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,834
Look at me!

528
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,519
It's fun, nice.

529
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,597
I can't wear this to dinner.

530
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,954
You can't change, it's a gift.
Look at me.

531
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,230
You don't have the whole shebang.

532
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,110
You have to make an effort.

533
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,039
You don't seem to realize
what's at stake here.

534
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,470
I have diplomatic priorities.

535
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,874
A coronation coming.

536
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,629
So if I'm dragging
this dead weight along...

537
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,149
Kissing everyone hello

538
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,989
and giving your gifts
to chambermaids, won't cut it.

539
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,430
It'll come. I'm learning.

540
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,437
I don't like costumes.

541
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,073
Or fish.

542
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,519
Or flowers.

543
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,115
I'm not picking that up.

544
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,312
We asked you to come in

545
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,751
as we heard disturbing things
about your Sri Lanka trip.

546
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,117
As you can imagine,
we have contacts the world over.

547
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,312
Arnaud's call earlier
only confirmed what we read

548
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,879
over the wire.

549
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,997
Everything has gone quickly.

550
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:00,751
Perhaps I haven't taken time
to explain the very basics

551
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,038
of your new position.

552
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,956
Some people adapt naturally.
Some don't.

553
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,679
All gifts,

554
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,355
so generously given,

555
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,031
must be shown and proudly worn,

556
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,515
whatever your personal preferences.

557
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,520
You are the image
of our whole realm,

558
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:23,235
whether traveling abroad
or in your own car.

559
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,079
And lastly,

560
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,875
don't forget to use
the favorable days of your cycle

561
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,275
to get started on a future prince,

562
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,432
keenly awaited
by the whole kingdom.

563
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,596
If you warn me in advance,
I might even

564
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,673
clear part of your schedule
on those days.

565
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,318
That's all, Armelle.

566
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,714
I think that does it.

567
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,551
Both doors lead to the same place.
Take your pick.

568
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,115
And Armelle...

569
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,516
Smile. Don't forget to smile.

570
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,229
You might get a tulip named for you.

571
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,032
You'll see, it's nice.

572
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,390
A crate of bulbs for you.

573
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,470
Tulips don't smell, Armelle.

574
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,755
You did have Marc do your hair?

575
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,916
A tall blond with a red mustache?

576
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,680
That's him. Strange.

577
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,872
For this afternoon,
you should change tops.

578
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,230
Seems silly, but people get bored.

579
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,000
You can't imagine
how attentive they are.

580
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:45,556
How lucky we are
to be outdoors with the flowers.

581
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,355
Poor Arnaud
in a brick factory in Khubourg.

582
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,036
- Turn over.
- Who do you think I am?

583
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,072
Ask Gilbert to plant them.

584
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,873
Scratchy sheets!

585
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,116
Didn't my shot numb you?

586
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,389
Dumb shit.

587
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,309
Just need a jacket.

588
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,078
I'll get it for you.

589
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,756
The white one,
or the beige one with gold buttons?

590
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,871
Or maybe pants. It's chilly.

591
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,035
I'll get them.

592
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,232
Don't bother, Bricka.
I'll find something.

593
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,709
Don't forget your panties.
Last time I had to hide them.

594
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,433
I'm very happy today.
Let me tell you why.

595
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:15,428
For years I have led
a grass-roots struggle

596
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,916
for renewed support
of that simple act of giving blood.

597
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,510
That's why I asked Princess Armelle,

598
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,269
Her Royal Highness,

599
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,072
to come lend a hand.

600
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,157
It didn't take much persuasion

601
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,630
for her to set an example

602
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,912
by giving a drop of her royal blood.

603
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:37,196
I hasten to add,
if anyone was wondering,

604
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,594
it is free.

605
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,196
And you even get a little snack.

606
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,992
I tasted it, very good.

607
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,075
Thank you, Armelle.

608
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,599
Up it comes...

609
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,394
A little smile?

610
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,518
Well done, Armelle.

611
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,636
I'm not hungry.

612
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,990
You should eat. We took a lot.

613
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,430
Really, a pint is a lot.

614
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,552
In a half hour
we're having cake.

615
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,270
What cake?

616
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,597
We're expected
at the senior center for tea.

617
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,828
It's not in my schedule.

618
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,031
It was planned well in advance.

619
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,231
Anyway, they can't wait.

620
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,668
You'll see,

621
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,758
you'll brighten their day.

622
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,754
Her Royal Highness,
Princess Armelle!

623
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,309
I'll clear a path to that asshole.

624
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,348
I'm starving.

625
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,429
Mrs. Victor.

626
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,956
Mr. Cordier, former diplomat.

627
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:33,157
Our eldest, Jeannette.
Over there, Mr Secretary.

628
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,397
Some refreshments?

629
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,639
Come this way.

630
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,554
She won the prize!
The crown!

631
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,957
Long live the Queen!

632
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,229
Pictures!

633
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,879
A little smile.

634
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,672
There, very nice.

635
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,070
Perfect.

636
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,673
You can start eating.

637
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,471
Jeannette, how are you?

638
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:08,910
Fine.

639
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,792
You haven't had your drink.

640
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,393
I'm loaded.

641
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,875
We got it, let's go.

642
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,789
You have TV?

643
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,237
It's great now, terrific.

644
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,471
All those new programs.

645
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,314
This is a model establishment.
Lovely.

646
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,839
Sorting and recycling.

647
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,993
- Wonderful! Paper with...
- Glass with glass.

648
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,434
Paper with paper.

649
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,594
I hope you all sort
your personal trash.

650
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,552
Very important for ecology.

651
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:38,995
Shit!

652
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,953
I'm sorry, Mr. Secretary.

653
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,636
I don't know how they got in.
There's a receptionist.

654
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,792
I thought that was over.

655
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,070
They always miss me,
but they got her.

656
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:57,317
Attacking a woman like that.
Ugly, very ugly.

657
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:58,870
No, let me.

658
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,275
After all, I am a doctor.

659
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,875
She hit her head, I heard it.

660
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,275
Shit.

661
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,148
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

662
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,193
Help me turn her over.

663
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,878
Princess, princess.

664
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,629
Armelle?

665
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,992
- She moved!
- Indeed.

666
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,359
Are you sure?

667
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:38,791
I'm expected for dinner,
but to put your mind at ease,

668
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:43,991
we could pop by my friend
Stoffer's clinic for a quick X-ray.

669
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,193
Gum. Good thinking.

670
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,548
We usually keep some
in the car, right?

671
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,837
But today, we're out of ammo.

672
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,190
I'd love one.

673
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:09,955
No.

674
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,918
Pathetic!

675
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,397
With that cardboard crown.

676
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,909
Sure there's no copies
of this spectacle?

677
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,599
Absolutely, Eugenia.

678
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,917
I went personally
to this senior center,

679
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:33,715
the visit to which, by the by,
was not on her schedule.

680
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,035
They brought me a poor old buzzard

681
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,754
who, praise the Lord,
gave me the camera.

682
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,554
I did, of course, leave him
a small reward.

683
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,509
The papers would have a field day.

684
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,149
She is such a twit. It's a first.

685
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,716
In ten centuries,
no one ever touched the royal family.

686
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,232
Between you and me,
I think people don't much like her.

687
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,556
She's just not popular, not...

688
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,078
I think we'd better
whittle down her schedule.

689
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,998
For remaining obligations,

690
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,156
keep her on a tight leash.

691
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,794
Do you still sell this item?

692
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,913
Yes, of course.

693
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,951
We have for years.

694
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,720
It's a Swiss company,
a favored supplier.

695
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,070
I'd like the same ones.

696
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:24,393
We've just received
the new color line.

697
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:27,478
Turquoise, little ladybugs.
It's younger.

698
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,870
- A nice change.
- No, the same ones.

699
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,673
Prefer the classics?

700
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,630
So that was... size L?

701
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,916
- No, size M.
- Fine.

702
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:42,348
No, actually, size S is better.

703
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:46,235
I'll show you one.
But you'll see it's teeny-weeny.

704
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:50,710
Unless, of course,
the gentleman is very slender.

705
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:54,995
There.

706
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,435
Perfect.

707
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,715
Fine.

708
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,470
It's a good item, sells well.

709
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:04,635
A classic.

710
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,110
Good choice.

711
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:40,915
The 15th looks good.
I'll have a little time then.

712
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,716
Thank you. Nice meeting you.

713
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:45,955
Mind the wire.

714
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,752
I was interrupted.

715
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:51,232
For the video, we'll see.
Don't mention it.

716
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,595
Thanks, bye.

717
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,270
Coming to the match?

718
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,438
No, my trainer is coming.

719
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,194
- Really?
- Yeah.

720
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,149
Coming.

721
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:05,954
Relax the shoulders.

722
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,275
Like that, Bruno?

723
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:08,959
Don't arch.

724
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:11,509
Straighten up.

725
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,393
Very good, Princess.

726
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,715
Right.

727
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:15,949
And left.

728
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,559
Like that is better.

729
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:18,795
No, that's tense.

730
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:22,518
Let's look at the buttocks.
Lean over.

731
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:26,237
That's all very tense.

732
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,708
Straighten up.

733
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,639
See you tonight.

734
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,876
What is it with me?

735
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:39,471
I suddenly feel
all fuzzy and weird

736
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,269
I feel sort of like

737
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:48,554
A little bird whispered in my ear

738
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,390
What is it with me today,

739
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,273
I'm in love with my wife!

740
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,914
Like on our first date
I'm in love with my wife!

741
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,155
I want to kiss her

742
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,755
I need to caress her

743
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,515
And I'm going to take her

744
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,113
on a vacation

745
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,839
Like newlyweds

746
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:20,279
Maybe we got married too young

747
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:23,114
I needed to do what a man has to do

748
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,991
I've tired of all my conquests

749
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,715
I now know she's my one true love

750
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,229
The cat,

751
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,192
the dog, the cat.

752
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,673
No, the cat!

753
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:38,149
Now the abs.

754
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,516
On your back, legs up, ankles.

755
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,390
I push, you try to resist.

756
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,309
You think I can?

757
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,672
It's up to you.

758
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,151
I'm going to take your pulse.

759
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:03,830
Bruno!

760
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,077
Nice going, old chap!

761
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:07,554
Tomorrow about five?

762
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:11,031
Wednesday is Tiphaine's birthday.
15 kids and no Titi.

763
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,352
Laurence, this is important.

764
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,950
When can you? You tell me.

765
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,039
No, not on the phone.

766
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:19,993
Why so damn mysterious?

767
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:23,193
Laurence, I have
three thirsty horses here.

768
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:24,556
Thursday.

769
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:25,391
At your place.

770
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:26,550
No, not my place.

771
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:29,433
Thursday, at five,
under the chestnut tree.

772
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,951
What are you looking at?

773
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,753
I'm not looking.

774
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:38,870
Sure?

775
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,069
There.

776
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:02,034
I told Delvaux not to alter it
or I wouldn't back him.

777
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,119
The Donge redistricting
was a complete panic.

778
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:06,959
He was surprised I knew.

779
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:10,709
After the Vanbergue thing,
what a nerve! Bunch of cretins.

780
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,956
I tried not to rub it in.

781
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:15,230
That asshole is so sensitive.

782
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:17,839
You know,

783
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,315
we eat too much at those inaugurals.

784
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,033
I must've gained 10 pounds.

785
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,310
I can't get into my boxers.

786
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:26,594
So I see.

787
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,558
Your Chinese masseur.

788
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:35,999
Tell me, Bricka,

789
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,959
did you eat tripe?

790
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,957
- No, why?
- No reason.

791
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,795
You sure you want a second scotch?

792
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,672
Let me see your dress again.

793
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:47,790
Coming.

794
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:10,276
Keep an eye on her.
Let's avoid ridicule tonight.

795
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,799
Don't worry.

796
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,149
I'm checking.

797
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:19,073
I never knew cream tart
made hair grow.

798
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,713
I use it daily.

799
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:22,916
Don't make me laugh.

800
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:32,280
Not easy to loosen
the two Pokemons up.

801
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,960
After the '94 fiasco,
we owed them this.

802
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,033
Alban, still into classical music?

803
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:44,188
The medals go on the left.

804
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,751
Do you see what I see?

805
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:00,999
What do we do?

806
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,751
Figure it out, big boy.

807
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,433
Campai!

808
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,470
Very refreshing, actually.

809
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:40,432
Boy, was I tired last night.
I don't get it.

810
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,951
I'm awake now though.

811
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:47,876
Feel that?

812
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:50,230
Watch the hair, please.

813
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:51,675
Sorry.

814
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,349
That's alright.

815
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:00,351
We can't find our Kinder eggs.
We looked all over.

816
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:02,391
Bricka put them on the table.

817
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,316
I don't know where they are.

818
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:08,351
Keep looking. You'll find them.

819
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:14,030
Lay off.

820
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,549
Your mail.

821
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,830
Eaten any garlic cheese recently?

822
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,190
- No, why?
- No reason.

823
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:24,550
Dr. Lecoutre will show you the way.

824
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:27,194
Could you let go of my arm?

825
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,475
Here.

826
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,871
Visitors, Mr. Coutard.

827
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,959
René-Guy, half a bowl left.
Small spoonfuls.

828
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:52,957
He can hardly open his mouth.

829
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:57,549
Well, I think I'll get some coffee.

830
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:00,235
We have our whole lives
to drink coffee.

831
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,079
One last spoonful?

832
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:21,953
Oh, isn't he cute?

833
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,399
Hello there.

834
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:38,668
There!

835
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:51,917
Armelle, sign the visitors' book
when Prince Arnaud has finished.

836
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:54,670
There.

837
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,919
"With love man can do anything."

838
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:17,120
"Maye thiss space

839
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,675
helpe many finde health
who were sick."

840
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,759
I got your coat.

841
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,951
Lots of people waiting outside.

842
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:30,275
No, I think I'll...

843
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,516
Yeah, right. It's warm out.

844
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:50,077
No, let me speak to the editor.
This is important.

845
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:53,431
Hello, sir.
My name is Marie- Ange Doré.

846
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:54,834
I'm a shopkeeper.

847
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,076
In my neighborhood, I often saw

848
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:00,909
Prince Arnaud
with a woman who isn't his wife.

849
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:05,068
Yes. Since you seem interested,

850
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:08,078
the womans name
is Laurence De Beck.

851
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:11,511
L-a-u-r-e-n-c-e, as in Laurence.

852
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:13,353
New word: "D-e".

853
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,670
New word: "B..."
No, "B".

854
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:17,873
"E-c-k".

855
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:22,278
I don't know if it's helpful,
but you can check where she goes.

856
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,311
You'll see what you find.

857
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:28,719
Here is her address:
48 Route de Brouckante. Yes, 48.

858
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,433
A big, redbrick house.

859
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:33,757
To the right
of the plaster figurine shop.

860
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:35,759
Don't mention it.

861
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:39,669
If you like, I also have
her license plate.

862
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:42,839
It's not easy for me.

863
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,593
It's the only way.

864
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,712
For you as well.

865
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,750
No, please don't cry.

866
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,071
You'll make me cry too.

867
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:56,439
There, there.

868
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,631
It's over now, all over.

869
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,472
Laurence: Our Camilla!

870
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:20,150
So one day we can go back
to what was then,

871
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:22,828
so tomorrow
may be yesterday again.

872
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,917
So one day we can go back
to what was then,

873
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,031
so tomorrow
may be yesterday again.

874
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:35,349
Great!

875
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:37,429
Come out.

876
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:49,269
That last one...

877
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:50,748
By far the best.

878
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,188
Bravo!

879
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:53,555
Major goosebumps.

880
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:56,030
I was listening, it was perfect.

881
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:59,078
I could do another one.
Wasn't it a little neutral?

882
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,271
No, really.
We'll play it for you.

883
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,437
Sure, let's play it back.

884
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:06,596
After all you've been through,

885
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,394
it was really nice of you
to come at all.

886
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:10,794
Hats off to you, hon.

887
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:13,593
- Great.
- Want tea?

888
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,396
Princess, what was your reaction?

889
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,909
That duet to support brumopathy -

890
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:22,673
why didn't you cancel?

891
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:25,110
Do you feel betrayed by Laurence?

892
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,038
Did Arnaud confess?

893
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,636
Will you welcome
the Norwegian royals later today?

894
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,472
Can you save your marriage?

895
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:34,796
I'm focused
on protecting my babies.

896
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,313
I was leaving her.

897
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:52,398
Yeah, right.
You can see that in the photo.

898
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,955
I'd just told her it was over.

899
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:58,311
She was crying.
I hugged her to console her.

900
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:00,033
Tell your daughters that.

901
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:03,357
It is their dad in the woods
with their godmother,

902
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:06,393
dry leaves stuck on his ass.
Majestic!

903
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:10,349
Did Mom call to say
you were handsome, concentrating,

904
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:12,113
very professional?

905
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:15,519
With that,
a divorce would be a cinch.

906
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,950
No, don't. This is so silly.

907
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:21,715
"No crown, no scepter's might
with no petticoat in sight."

908
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,876
Tell me what you want me to do.

909
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,672
What do you want me to do?

910
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:28,348
For starters,
stop spitting in my ear.

911
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:31,279
I don't know,
ask Laurence to marry you.

912
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:34,632
Laurence De Beck, née Coignard,
bathmat manufacturer,

913
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:36,558
married, two kids.
No good.

914
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:40,714
Give me
one more chance, I beg you.

915
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,717
Get a grip. Look.

916
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,713
The two Neutrogenas
are smiling at you.

917
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:47,393
Arnaud sucks!

918
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,633
Poor Arnaud,

919
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,997
king of the forest.

920
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:00,190
You're in deep poo now!

921
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:02,235
I like you picking us up, Mom.

922
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:04,078
I like it, too.

923
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:07,836
Bricka always gives me
my snack right away.

924
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:09,712
We'll have a feast at home.

925
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,234
Alright, cool!

926
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,392
But that's not the way home.

927
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:15,352
Through the garden, it's nicer.

928
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:16,993
More splendid.

929
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:18,515
Your Highness.

930
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:22,078
Picking up
Princesses Constance and Louise?

931
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:24,999
I get my kids at school,
like any mom.

932
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,758
A mom and a woman

933
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,992
who forgave her husband
to protect her family.

934
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,152
You don't think,
you just act, you move on.

935
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:37,114
I have two daughters.
I think I've kept them safe.

936
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:39,550
With lots of love, that's all.

937
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:42,276
A mother, a woman, a citizen

938
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:45,472
more and more active
on the domestic front,

939
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:46,999
helping the poor.

940
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,435
I try to act, in my own little way.

941
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:52,837
I've decided to launch
"Poundcake for the Needy Day."

942
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,909
If each of us made one poundcake...

943
00:59:56,200 --> 01:00:01,274
- It's so easy:
4 eggs, flour, butter, sugar -

944
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,955
the world would be a better place.

945
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:06,355
Also... Well, now's not the time.

946
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:08,312
Please, Princess. Go ahead.

947
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:10,954
Since you're here...

948
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:15,473
We have a very beautiful palace,
but it's always closed.

949
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:18,148
So I've organized an open house

950
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:21,591
on November 15th
from 8 AM to 10 PM.

951
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:25,076
I wanted to give people back
some of what's theirs.

952
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:26,548
Thank you very much.

953
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:28,193
No, don't mention it.

954
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:56,078
Armelle, Armelle!

955
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:09,719
Your gym instructor

956
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,109
has just arrived.

957
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:13,311
Have him wait, be right there.

958
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:15,511
Bricka, did you eat spoiled salmon?

959
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:16,675
No, why?

960
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,189
No reason.

961
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,592
Come on, ten more.

962
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:27,151
You like keeping me waiting?
What am I, a salesman?

963
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:30,434
No, Bruno.
I had a couple of things to do.

964
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:34,437
So are we meeting at lkea
on Wednesday at 4?

965
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:36,509
I have my son that day.

966
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:37,988
I don't see him much.

967
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:40,239
Loosen those adductives.

968
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:41,356
Lift your thighs.

969
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:44,511
Like that. That's good.

970
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:45,994
There. Got a lighter?

971
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:48,675
I think so.

972
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:52,958
OK, come over here.

973
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:56,395
What is this?

974
01:01:56,640 --> 01:02:00,519
Hold it tight. I'll count to ten.
Walk and don't drop it.

975
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:02,832
Don't drop it.

976
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:08,309
Princess!

977
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:10,193
OK, let's put it back in.

978
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:14,398
Hold it tight.

979
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:20,276
Bruno, it's hard.

980
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:33,194
Look! A secret passage!

981
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:35,837
Captain Hook's treasure!

982
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:39,793
It's huge in here!

983
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:42,196
- What's this?
- I don't know.

984
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:47,390
Great!
The stroller in the begonias.

985
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:51,753
Where's Mr. Gibon? I told him
to stay in the garden, dammit!

986
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:56,470
Why did she organize
this damned stupid open-house?

987
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:58,432
Ridiculous masquerade!

988
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:00,716
She did catch us unawares.

989
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:02,035
From now on,

990
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:06,831
as long as I'm alive, the palace
will be forever closed to the public!

991
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:08,911
It is unpleasant, I agree.

992
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:11,156
Praise the Lord, we're safe here.

993
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:12,993
Look, it's open.

994
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:16,914
This is gorgeous.

995
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:20,753
This is private.

996
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,592
Isn't it open house today?

997
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,118
- The queen!
- Where?

998
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,111
Hello. Welcome.

999
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:32,993
So weird to see you here!

1000
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:34,468
Watch your ice cream.

1001
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:36,075
That's silk.

1002
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:37,958
It's delicate and old.

1003
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:40,031
Can we take a picture with you?

1004
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:41,395
My hair's untidy.

1005
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,631
You look fine like that.

1006
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:53,670
Don't stand there by yourself.
There's room for you.

1007
01:03:57,960 --> 01:03:59,188
Excuse me.

1008
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:09,276
Excuse me,
where is the mens room?

1009
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:14,351
Half a block down on the left,
there's a café with full amenities.

1010
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,751
That hag is busting our chops.

1011
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:49,156
It's ringing off the hook.

1012
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:52,557
There's not a single Armelle mug
left in stock.

1013
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:55,873
There are just
two chipped plates left.

1014
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:58,833
They say they might recycle
the Arnaud ones.

1015
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:02,191
Let's face it.
Since the Laurence affair...

1016
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:04,359
sales have slipped.

1017
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:07,393
I've been thinking
maybe it would be best

1018
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:10,717
to push the coronation back
just a little.

1019
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:14,433
What a sucker,
getting caught like that.

1020
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:17,838
We were, praise the Lord,

1021
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:20,110
always more discreet.

1022
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:22,552
And less watched.

1023
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:24,273
Let them have tee-shirts.

1024
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:27,199
We've done that,
but we're running low.

1025
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:31,188
We reprinted some jigsaw puzzles
last week. They're sold out.

1026
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:34,073
The watches and spoons
were due yesterday,

1027
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:37,113
but the ship
has been held up in Amsterdam.

1028
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:40,551
It's a customs problem.
Nothing I can do.

1029
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:43,395
Tell your wholesalers to watch it.

1030
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:47,115
The wipes and the margarine,
I think, is a bit much.

1031
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:51,476
Well, Eugenia,
it does butter the kingdom's bread.

1032
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:52,954
We don't need that.

1033
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:01,032
The queen was talking crap.

1034
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:04,915
She said the maid heard them
make the appointment.

1035
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,557
It's only ten after four.

1036
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:11,472
They played like shit last night.

1037
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,275
After two penalties, I went to bed.

1038
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:16,436
With all the money they make!

1039
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:18,592
Look! The princess's car.

1040
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:20,950
And the guy. Right on time.

1041
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,550
Too far. I need a longer lens.

1042
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:27,715
- The entrance would've been better.
- Yeah, right!

1043
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:30,310
In the open, with our big guns!

1044
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:03,953
- Owen.
- Yes?

1045
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:05,788
Back in a half hour.

1046
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,831
Don't hurry! This is cool!

1047
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:16,519
Colorful, inexpensive.
I want to buy it all!

1048
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:18,597
Quiet. We're not here for that...

1049
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:21,878
Where are you taking me?

1050
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:32,911
Yesterday afternoon,
the princess lent her support

1051
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:37,551
to the medical team
of "One Waffle, One Vaccine."

1052
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:42,191
The princess came despite
the heatwave in southern Bazombié.

1053
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:46,109
More proof of her generosity
and her commitment.

1054
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:51,198
Budget Minister Louis Neveld
today defended his new bill...

1055
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:23,799
What good is this?

1056
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:27,476
If I want to see her kiss a kid,
I'll buy a newspaper.

1057
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:29,398
Really, Your Highness...

1058
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:33,469
There were two of us.
I brought a friend, for back-up.

1059
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:35,711
Putting a lamp into her trunk.

1060
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:39,196
Sell it to This Old House.
It's not what I wanted.

1061
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,470
I couldn't just ask them...
Sorry to be vulgar...

1062
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:46,435
to start necking in the parking lot.

1063
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:49,237
It's not you, Queenie,

1064
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:52,159
but maybe the maid
gave you a bum tip.

1065
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:55,875
- It happens.
- I haven't got all day.

1066
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:57,758
Here's half of your fee.

1067
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:59,313
Which is quite enough.

1068
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:00,748
Thanks anyway.

1069
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:03,996
You're lucky it's Christmas soon.

1070
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:14,274
Everything Happens Before 60

1071
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,596
I'm going back to bed. Coming?

1072
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:22,028
I'm reading.

1073
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:24,351
Should I put my little man here?

1074
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:28,357
No, darling, it's not great.
What do you think?

1075
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:31,474
I'll make a better one,
with more red.

1076
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:34,234
Don't bother.
We have enough decorations.

1077
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:36,232
Real balls are prettier, right?

1078
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:38,556
Yes, they are, Constance dear.

1079
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:50,074
Mom, remember
when you were nice?

1080
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:52,591
Not now. Go brush your teeth.

1081
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:00,598
What a beautiful view.

1082
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:04,278
Although it's a lot colder
on the chairlift.

1083
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:06,994
Mind you, modern clothing
is so advanced.

1084
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:09,760
These gloves stop you
getting frostbite.

1085
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:14,272
I see why you don't like the J-bar,
with your little problem...

1086
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:16,072
with your particularity.

1087
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:23,995
With your extra testicle
the bar must get in the way.

1088
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:26,549
- Must hurt.
- What are you talking about?

1089
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:29,479
I didn't mean to offend.
We all have something.

1090
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:32,672
I have a beauty mark
behind my ear to live with.

1091
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:35,838
I knew a girl in school
with two anuses.

1092
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:37,632
Must've been complicated.

1093
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:41,879
I wonder what became of her.
Nice girl. Véronique Gonel...

1094
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:47,189
Sorry for harping on about it,
but I don't understand.

1095
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:50,358
Relax, you can't tell
by looking at you.

1096
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:54,713
It's not like you wear a sign.
You'll find a girl who loves you,

1097
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:56,831
who won't bother counting.

1098
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:58,598
Where did you hear this?

1099
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:01,513
I think your mother told me,
I can't remember.

1100
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:03,597
Yes, it was your mother.

1101
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:09,438
I guess she was protecting you
by telling your girlfriends.

1102
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:11,439
I don't believe it.

1103
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:14,837
Must be plenty of men
on the slopes with 3 nuts

1104
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:16,314
who have wives and kids.

1105
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:17,589
Here we are.

1106
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:49,677
Thank heaven for those Italians

1107
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:52,713
or I'd still be up there,
suffering in the snow.

1108
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:55,434
When I saw them,
I was so relieved.

1109
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:59,269
These Italians are very nice.
Always very elegant.

1110
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:01,716
I never liked cell phones,

1111
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:04,474
but it changed my mind.
Pass me a brioche.

1112
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:05,874
With blueberry jam?

1113
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:08,078
That's kind of you.

1114
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:11,955
Don't be sad, son.

1115
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:13,428
It isn't serious.

1116
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:15,870
I'll be in a cast 3 weeks.

1117
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:19,834
I'll use the time for calligraphy.
I have to catch up.

1118
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:21,792
Could I watch, Grandmother?

1119
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:23,234
If you're good.

1120
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,518
Hot water never works here.

1121
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:27,430
Amazing.

1122
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:30,274
Arnaud, in this light,
you look like René-Guy.

1123
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:31,994
It's incredible.

1124
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:34,191
Yes, you're right, Armelle.

1125
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:36,632
I noticed it when he was born.

1126
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:39,477
Don't be mad.

1127
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:41,510
He's handsome.

1128
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:44,513
I don't agree.
Where do you get these ideas?

1129
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:47,636
It's snowing.

1130
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:50,633
It has been
since three this afternoon.

1131
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:53,155
They changed the time
for midnight mass.

1132
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:55,032
I liked it at nine.

1133
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:56,508
Better for the kids.

1134
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:57,829
Much better.

1135
01:12:58,120 --> 01:12:59,314
Much better...

1136
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:21,752
One new message

1137
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:24,836
Merry Christmas! From Bruno

1138
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:01,792
Your little Jesus has room in my inn

1139
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:05,958
Look, it's Santa Claus.

1140
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:07,950
It's me!

1141
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:12,756
Honey, they'll be here
in 2 minutes. Go hide.

1142
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:16,475
By the way, your grandma's present
is in the fridge.

1143
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:18,193
Hurry up. They're...

1144
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:20,078
Alban, where are the gifts?

1145
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:22,828
No gifts this year.
And no Santa Claus.

1146
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:25,640
Alban, go hide.
The girls are coming.

1147
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:28,832
No, I won't hide.
It's all over.

1148
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,268
What did you say

1149
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:33,717
to keep me from reigning,
from marrying, being happy?

1150
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:35,953
Whatever do you mean?

1151
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:39,312
Drinking champagne
with nothing in your belly.

1152
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:42,318
At least have a slice of bread.

1153
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:44,272
So I'll be silent again!

1154
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:46,875
I'm not drunk.
I know what I'm saying.

1155
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:49,111
Now I know
why every girl left me.

1156
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,555
Make me out a freak. Great idea.

1157
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:54,792
Didn't you see the one time
you changed my diaper?

1158
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:56,712
Too busy with René-Guy,

1159
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:58,839
taking care of Arnie,

1160
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:00,069
the love child.

1161
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:02,311
I knew it. I figured it out!

1162
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:04,869
First Christmas without poor dad.

1163
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:07,150
You snuck around behind his back.

1164
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:09,351
Maybe you arranged the accident

1165
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:12,110
to kill us both, and crown Arnaud!

1166
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:14,788
How Christian! How nice!

1167
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:17,873
I had time to think it through
during mass.

1168
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:20,114
I spent my childhood

1169
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:24,751
in Switzerland, eating Swiss cheese,
while Arnie in his mommy's skirt

1170
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:27,349
never did homework,
his 3 brain cells

1171
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:29,113
wired on marijuana!

1172
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:31,197
While I slaved in universities,

1173
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:32,634
all for nothing!

1174
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:35,474
No, I don't have three testicles!

1175
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:37,910
No! And I'll prove it!

1176
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:40,635
Don't, my dear!
Grandma believes you.

1177
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:43,638
The king-to-be in the woods
while his wife

1178
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:45,029
works for charity.

1179
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:47,475
You ruined me. I had no chance.

1180
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:49,194
Lies,

1181
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:50,395
theatrics...

1182
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:51,396
Old cow!

1183
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:54,235
Selfish bitch,
you got what you wanted!

1184
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:55,589
That's our mother!

1185
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:57,159
Shut up, bastard.

1186
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:59,436
Only your glasses come from Dad!

1187
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:02,150
Calm down. Take my hanky.

1188
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:04,199
Give me the bottle.

1189
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:05,879
I'm loaded.

1190
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:12,151
That's not Santa, it's Alban.

1191
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:15,591
They're not worth
getting so upset about.

1192
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:17,472
It's not worth the pain.

1193
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:19,238
You're too sensitive

1194
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:21,590
and they're so heartless.

1195
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:24,678
You rest,
I'll bring you some turkey.

1196
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:29,073
If I were you,
I think I'd write a book.

1197
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:31,632
Sure, with all you know.

1198
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:33,717
- Think so?
- Of course.

1199
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:37,197
Calm down.
Take deep breaths.

1200
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:46,154
Your mother really does tell
tall tales.

1201
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:07,110
Watch him jump over the fence.

1202
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:09,796
OK, all this in the garbage.

1203
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:21,190
I see.

1204
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:23,356
- What do you see?
- No, nothing.

1205
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:29,916
Touch mom's phone - I'll tell.

1206
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,108
- Give me that.
- No.

1207
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:33,435
Give me that.

1208
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:37,753
Mom'll smack you.

1209
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,672
She won't - I'll smack her.

1210
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:43,035
- Girls, up to your rooms.
- Why?

1211
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:44,559
I have an errand to run.

1212
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:45,755
Alright.

1213
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:51,990
I recentered your energy.

1214
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:54,475
You might be tired tonight.

1215
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:58,275
Have some herb tea
and wear socks to bed.

1216
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:02,678
Not very sexy for Prince Arnaud,
but it's for the best.

1217
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:05,999
Your phone. Should I get it?

1218
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:08,077
Not mine. I left it home.

1219
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:10,236
Must be mine. Excuse me.

1220
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:13,676
A grain of rice is unstuck.

1221
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:15,435
Excuse me, yes.

1222
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:18,075
That's normal.

1223
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:19,992
Pancreatic meridian reaction.

1224
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:23,033
It shows
the point was adequately stimulated.

1225
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:25,515
Do you have enough cellular lotion?

1226
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,671
Do you have enough lotion?

1227
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:46,556
- Where were you?
- I need tea.

1228
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:49,232
Does 90% fat ring a bell?

1229
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:50,634
I don't get it.

1230
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:52,074
Well I do!

1231
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:55,193
Your cell phone.

1232
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:57,396
- You forgot it.
- You called?

1233
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:59,352
Bruno did. Five times.

1234
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:03,678
You were dynamite yesterday.
He wants to punish you good.

1235
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:05,399
Working out is great.

1236
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:08,956
Firm up your pussy while I gorge on your 40% crap!

1237
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:10,878
And Alban says thank you.

1238
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:13,355
He's got 50 pages written already.

1239
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:17,957
The title is "Dethroned"
or "Naked King." He's not sure which.

1240
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:21,878
This remind you of anything?

1241
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:23,195
It's for you.

1242
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:26,113
Wort change you back,
but it'll do me good.

1243
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:28,550
You're crazy! Crazy!

1244
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:30,398
You'll wake my girls.

1245
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:33,592
Poor little things
looking for their chocolates

1246
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:36,872
while their bitch of a mother
ate them on the sly

1247
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:39,878
and stashed the surprises
under the bed!

1248
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:42,275
- Sweet Armelle, my ass!
- Help!

1249
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:45,478
And the day winds up
with the Tulip Ball.

1250
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:50,310
Armelle has scarlet fever
and can't attend. Get well soon.

1251
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:51,111
Thanks.

1252
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:56,432
Hey, hon. Sleep well?

1253
01:19:57,080 --> 01:19:58,513
Here's some vanilla tea.

1254
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:01,513
Fatia made us pastries.
She's a mother to us.

1255
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:05,190
I won't have her on the balcony.
I won't say it again!

1256
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:07,470
It's my birthday - I decide!

1257
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:12,117
I said she had scarlet fever.
I couldn't give a royal fu...

1258
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:15,118
Sorry, Arnaud,
but after what you told me...

1259
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:16,514
We don't need her.

1260
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:31,594
Armelle, Armelle!

1261
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:01,836
She doesn't have scarlet fever.

1262
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:05,756
Well?

1263
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:07,475
Nothing.

1264
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:09,352
Not even a faint hope?

1265
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:11,871
René-Guy, you must've botched it!

1266
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:16,350
I even said that, for her,
we were redoing the gold leaf

1267
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:19,358
on the King Anselme carriage,
last used in 1740.

1268
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:22,438
I ran out of arguments.
She clammed up

1269
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:24,232
and gave me a look to kill.

1270
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:27,073
I gave up the ghost.

1271
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:29,834
Next thing you know,
we'll be a republic!

1272
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:31,874
It isn't that bad.

1273
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:36,432
It is! After the excerpts
from Alban's book, that'll be next!

1274
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:39,594
There's talk of slashing
half our budget!

1275
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:42,508
The Prime Minister
actually phoned me

1276
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:45,359
at 7:15 AM, just after my croissant!

1277
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:47,039
He even hinted

1278
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:49,748
that if she didn't come,
it would be...

1279
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:51,070
A revolt.

1280
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:54,232
No. A revolution!
A real big, bloody mess.

1281
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:57,669
Our last resort,
in these dire times,

1282
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:00,075
is for you to ask her yourself,

1283
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:02,470
personally, in person,

1284
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:03,750
Eugenia.

1285
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:06,669
Merde!

1286
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:12,075
I forgot, she's gone into exile
at the home of Maurane, the vocalist.

1287
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:30,351
Come in, Lionel. It's open.

1288
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:33,514
I said it's open!

1289
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:35,836
Push the garbage cans
out of the way.

1290
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:39,072
Relax, I'm coming.

1291
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,232
What a jerk!

1292
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:49,629
Hello, Your Majesty...

1293
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:51,429
Your Highness.

1294
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:52,516
Miss.

1295
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:54,358
Please come in.

1296
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:56,949
Want some java,
I mean some coffee?

1297
01:23:57,160 --> 01:23:59,116
No, thanks. I've had lunch.

1298
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:02,553
It's nice here.
Not easy to find, but...

1299
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:04,952
A group of us bought it.

1300
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:08,038
We have a nanny for all the kids.
It's cool!

1301
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:10,515
Fine. I know Armelle is here.

1302
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:12,473
She's upstairs working out.

1303
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:14,318
I'll tell her you're here.

1304
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:18,511
I have all the equipment.
I used it for two weeks.

1305
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:19,949
Look.

1306
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:23,553
Hello, Armelle.

1307
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:25,950
Don't stop on my account.

1308
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:31,598
Very becoming outfit.
Must be comfortable.

1309
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:33,028
Yes, very.

1310
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:41,239
I'll come straight to the point.
I regret the misunderstandings,

1311
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:44,238
these little passing quarrels

1312
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:48,399
which, while insignificant,
are sadly part of life.

1313
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:51,029
Let's let bygones be bygones.

1314
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:52,673
Arnaud is sorry

1315
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:54,148
for his tantrum.

1316
01:24:55,920 --> 01:25:00,436
As a favor to me,
come to his coronation next week.

1317
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:04,516
It was delayed once.
We can't put it off forever.

1318
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:08,114
I know the "Give Peace A Jump"
event is important to you.

1319
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:09,992
Very laudable.

1320
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:15,115
But perhaps this trip to England
could be put off until next year.

1321
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:18,708
Historically,
we don't adore the English.

1322
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:21,679
After all they filched
from us in Africa...

1323
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:23,916
You could come for an hour.

1324
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:25,758
Even a half hour.

1325
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:26,836
Fifteen minutes.

1326
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:43,469
The compass.

1327
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:44,999
The t-square.

1328
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:46,508
Sewing scissors.

1329
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:49,634
The cat.

1330
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:52,708
The dog.

1331
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:54,959
The dolphin.

1332
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:56,388
The dog again.

1333
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:58,633
The heliport.

1334
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:02,349
The paved heliport.
I said paved.

1335
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:06,278
Good. Starting to take.

1336
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:10,313
What can we eat?

1337
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:14,713
You, I know.

1338
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:20,679
That's good, baby.

1339
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:24,033
Our viewers should know

1340
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:27,550
you didn't want a list
of questions in advance.

1341
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:29,193
Only natural.

1342
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:31,197
But so rare nowadays.

1343
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:37,428
The queen is said to be harsh
with you and her grandchildren.

1344
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:41,633
People say so many things.
One must keep them in perspective.

1345
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:43,751
True, she's not drawn to children.

1346
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:47,390
But she's very keen on her garden,
loves her flowers.

1347
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:50,394
Much has been made
of her stinginess,

1348
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:55,355
the thing about the stale chocolate
she gave the help for Christmas.

1349
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:58,478
And I've heard
she has hygiene issues.

1350
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:00,193
All that is so petty.

1351
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:05,591
She doesn't need that kind
of publicity right now.

1352
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:07,916
Which is why I wanted some space,

1353
01:27:08,120 --> 01:27:12,477
as well as not feeling
very safe in my homeland...

1354
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:15,630
Alban implies as much
in the excerpts

1355
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:18,149
from his book published last week.

1356
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:21,030
So he wrote it. I didn't know.

1357
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:24,118
I advised against it.
I thought it a bad idea.

1358
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:27,153
I try to bring this family together.

1359
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:31,239
It's not always easy. After all,
they have different fathers.

1360
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:34,148
Psychologically, it's more complex.

1361
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:35,990
Of course.

1362
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:38,073
I can't believe it.

1363
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:40,188
May I pinch you?

1364
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:41,594
Yes, please do.

1365
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:46,436
As you're so close to the people,
we have a surprise.

1366
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:49,873
Elodie is 18.

1367
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:52,355
I found her freezing
in the hotel lobby.

1368
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:54,596
She wanted to bring you a gift.

1369
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:55,875
Really?

1370
01:27:56,280 --> 01:28:00,068
She spent her savings
just to show her love for you.

1371
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:11,835
I'm sorry.

1372
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:13,759
This is too wonderful.

1373
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:15,229
I can't get over it.

1374
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:16,589
Poor kid.

1375
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:18,068
Hello, Elodie.

1376
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:23,951
How does it feel to see
the princess in the flesh?

1377
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:27,553
It's too great.
I'm not used to this.

1378
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:30,478
That's a gift of life.

1379
01:28:32,160 --> 01:28:36,073
If you're free tomorrow, Elodie,
come backstage to the jump.

1380
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:40,115
Then the two of us can go
shopping together as friends.

1381
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:42,438
Oh yes, I'm free.

1382
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:44,428
Here, it's for you.

1383
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:48,155
It's nothing. Just so you think
of me when you look at it.

1384
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:49,998
Thank you, that's so sweet.

1385
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:51,713
Thank you, Elodie.

1386
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:53,473
See you later, dear.

1387
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:57,397
See you tomorrow. Promise?

1388
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:08,717
You see, it's people like these
I care about.

1389
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:11,957
More so than squabbles
over court and power.

1390
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:13,513
So many send their love.

1391
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:18,196
I get sacks full of mail,
adorable musical greeting cards.

1392
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:19,390
I wanted

1393
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:22,677
to thank people personally
here tonight. May I?

1394
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:23,995
Of course.

1395
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:25,918
Thank you so much.

1396
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:27,229
Bitch.

1397
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:31,671
Thanks to your growing popularity,

1398
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:34,036
the global committee selected you

1399
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:37,317
to participate in the second year
of a major event,

1400
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:40,432
"Give Peace A Jump,"
which many here see as

1401
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:42,352
a great leap for peace.

1402
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:46,474
And bungee jumping
with you in London

1403
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:49,319
will be no less than Pavarotti,

1404
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:50,875
Carole Bouquet...

1405
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:52,109
The Dalai Lama.

1406
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:53,435
Yes, the man.

1407
01:29:54,040 --> 01:29:56,110
And David Beckham, Brad Pitt...

1408
01:29:56,440 --> 01:30:01,230
You're the only royal to be chosen,
for all you represent.

1409
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:04,709
Have you had any special training?

1410
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:07,394
I just worked out,
some roller blading.

1411
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:09,790
Yeah, you worked out. Shut up.

1412
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:13,475
Didn't Denise's girl
do bungee jumping?

1413
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:14,909
The older one?

1414
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:16,917
- She's in Australia.
- So what?

1415
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:24,318
Armelle is so brave.

1416
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:25,953
She's very athletic.

1417
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:28,551
Pavarotti lost weight.

1418
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:30,398
He did the Atkins diet.

1419
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:35,392
Are you ready?
I wanted to wish you luck.

1420
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:39,997
Princess, it's me.

1421
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:42,516
It's Elodie. You promised!

1422
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:18,951
No baggage?

1423
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:21,594
No more at home.
I could only find this.

1424
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:28,993
Sorry to meet you here twice
in so short a time.

1425
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:33,791
Hope it's not serious.
Or permanent. She's so athletic.

1426
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:40,518
Thanks for coming out tonight.
This ruins a weekend.

1427
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:43,354
Well, it's the least I could do.

1428
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:48,635
Unfortunately, we will be seeing
each other Saturday.

1429
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,195
What do I have on Saturday?

1430
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:55,151
The queen never appreciated her.

1431
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:57,476
Even though Armelle
was defending her on TV

1432
01:31:57,680 --> 01:32:00,240
right before the big jump.

1433
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:03,390
She knew way too much.

1434
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:05,438
All that crap they feed us:

1435
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:08,234
She mistakenly took
Pavarotti's bungee

1436
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:10,510
and bounced one too many times.

1437
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:15,636
Their staff and everyone
rigged the bungee beforehand.

1438
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:16,869
I know it.

1439
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:20,638
God has called you

1440
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:22,108
back to the fold.

1441
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:24,349
Armelle...

1442
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:26,879
Through your grace,

1443
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:29,799
your goodness, and your kindness,

1444
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:34,193
you gave meaning
to the word "love."

1445
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:38,429
Armelle, in Celtic,

1446
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:42,830
means "princess of the bears."

1447
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:47,790
Havert we all been
a bear with her?

1448
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:52,397
Let us search inside ourselves,
each one of us,

1449
01:32:52,680 --> 01:32:56,719
deep in our hearts for the bear

1450
01:32:57,200 --> 01:33:00,112
which may at times be hurtful,

1451
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:01,992
even murderous.

1452
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:08,473
Struck down in mid-flight,

1453
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:13,478
as you gave of yourself,
as you jumped for peace...

1454
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:15,389
You,

1455
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:18,116
who thought always of others,

1456
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:21,392
who initiated that great day

1457
01:33:21,640 --> 01:33:23,073
of open house.

1458
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:29,229
The time has come
to return to Jesus.

1459
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:31,793
Jesus calls to you,

1460
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,353
"Come,

1461
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:36,115
"I need you.

1462
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:41,359
"Up here in Heaven too,
we need you."
