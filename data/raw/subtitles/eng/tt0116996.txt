1
00:00:27,104 --> 00:00:29,357
Howdy there, Mr. Lee.

2
00:00:29,523 --> 00:00:31,776
What's this? Filipino New Year's?

3
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,945
No. Why you say that?

4
00:00:34,028 --> 00:00:35,863
'Cause you're cooking a feast.

5
00:00:35,947 --> 00:00:38,449
I can smell it from the interstate.

6
00:00:38,783 --> 00:00:41,035
What is that? Barbecue?

7
00:00:41,244 --> 00:00:43,746
Yeah. But it not coming from here.

8
00:00:44,622 --> 00:00:46,249
What is that noise?

9
00:04:17,631 --> 00:04:20,217
What is your take on this, Jerry?

10
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:23,261
The people will love it, Mr. President.

11
00:04:23,595 --> 00:04:28,183
Our conflict is whether we ambush
the 6:00 news or hold out for prime time.

12
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,685
Screw the press.
This is a need-to-know situation.

13
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:34,773
We should make it top secret,
and should move in with Defcon Four.

14
00:04:34,981 --> 00:04:36,858
We can't sit on this.

15
00:04:38,526 --> 00:04:40,987
General Casey, do you have an opinion?

16
00:04:42,364 --> 00:04:43,615
Well, sir...

17
00:04:43,782 --> 00:04:45,283
...do we know they are hostile?

18
00:04:45,367 --> 00:04:47,285
What do you mean?

19
00:04:47,702 --> 00:04:50,288
They have the planet surrounded
by thousands of warships!

20
00:04:50,372 --> 00:04:52,290
Do we know they're warships?

21
00:04:55,794 --> 00:04:58,880
Professor, what do we know about them?

22
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,718
They're very advanced technologically.

23
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:06,055
Which suggests, rightfully so,
that they're peaceful.

24
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,018
An advanced civilization is,
by definition, not barbaric.

25
00:05:11,143 --> 00:05:12,645
Mr. President...

26
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,564
...this is a great day.

27
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,649
I and all my colleagues...

28
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,568
...are extremely excited.

29
00:05:19,026 --> 00:05:19,944
Good.

30
00:05:21,153 --> 00:05:23,531
Extraterrestrial life.

31
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,325
You're right, Jerry.

32
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:29,036
The people are going to love it.

33
00:05:29,161 --> 00:05:31,539
This is a momentous occasion.

34
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,249
Mr. President--

35
00:05:33,332 --> 00:05:35,167
We'll go all media on this.

36
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:37,086
I'll wear my Cerruti suit.

37
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,921
I'll need a good speech.

38
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:41,340
Statesman-like...

39
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,384
...historical and yet...

40
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,595
...warm, neighborly.

41
00:05:45,761 --> 00:05:49,557
Abraham Lincoln meets
Leave it to Beaver, kind of thing.

42
00:05:51,058 --> 00:05:52,685
Are they too old-fashioned?

43
00:05:52,768 --> 00:05:54,353
No, I don't think so.

44
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:58,065
This has got the colors but, no.
I don't think so.

45
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,568
Not vivid enough.

46
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,778
Nancy had this in the library.

47
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:02,696
Yes, indeed.

48
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,031
I don't think so.

49
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:07,492
I thought perhaps the watered silk.
This week it's on sale.

50
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,579
I hardly think I need worry about that.

51
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:13,373
My husband is the leader of the free world.

52
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,043
What do you think?

53
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:20,756
Why don't you leave the Roosevelt Room
the way the Roosevelts wanted it.

54
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:25,719
Because Eleanor Roosevelt was
too fond of chintz. That's why.

55
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,222
Mother, this isn't your house.

56
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,475
lf you're going to be a pest, I'll ignore you!

57
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:32,851
Mrs. Dale?

58
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,960
I saw you fight Sonny Liston in '69.

59
00:06:58,127 --> 00:06:59,212
Really?

60
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:01,548
You were a nun back then?

61
00:07:01,714 --> 00:07:04,884
We've always been fight fans,
haven't we sisters?

62
00:07:05,218 --> 00:07:07,470
Byron Williams, telephone.

63
00:07:07,637 --> 00:07:08,721
I must go.

64
00:07:08,888 --> 00:07:11,391
You ladies have a nice time.

65
00:07:17,021 --> 00:07:18,356
Oh, Louise.

66
00:07:18,898 --> 00:07:21,067
Sorry to call you at work, but...

67
00:07:21,568 --> 00:07:25,738
...the boys haven't been home
in two nights. I don't know what to do.

68
00:07:25,905 --> 00:07:27,991
You're doing the best you can.

69
00:07:28,241 --> 00:07:29,993
They're just at that age.

70
00:07:32,078 --> 00:07:35,540
The casino manager's giving me
the evil eye. I've gotta go.

71
00:07:35,665 --> 00:07:37,417
I'll call you later, okay?

72
00:07:38,251 --> 00:07:41,421
Are you still cool on me
coming to Washington?

73
00:07:41,588 --> 00:07:43,256
'Course I am.

74
00:07:43,756 --> 00:07:46,342
You take care, okay? Bye.

75
00:08:02,276 --> 00:08:04,111
Must you drink in front of me?

76
00:08:04,194 --> 00:08:06,280
You're an adult. Just cope.

77
00:08:06,447 --> 00:08:09,617
It doesn't help me
that all we ever do is sit in bars.

78
00:08:09,783 --> 00:08:11,619
This is work, baby, okay?

79
00:08:11,785 --> 00:08:15,456
I'm checking the decor,
the lighting, the traffic flow.

80
00:08:15,623 --> 00:08:18,626
lf I'd known you'd turn into a crook,
I wouldn't have married you.

81
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:20,628
I'm not a crook.

82
00:08:20,794 --> 00:08:22,963
I'm ambitious. There's a difference.

83
00:08:23,047 --> 00:08:25,799
lf you think you can make
a nickel in this town...

84
00:08:25,883 --> 00:08:29,637
...without knowing how to dally
around a few curves, well...

85
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:32,640
...you know nothing
of the gambling industry.

86
00:08:34,141 --> 00:08:38,229
The Galaxy's going to be
the best hotel in Vegas.

87
00:08:38,395 --> 00:08:40,064
The best!

88
00:08:40,272 --> 00:08:41,148
I promise.

89
00:08:41,232 --> 00:08:43,817
But don't you realize what you're doing?
You're destroying the Earth!

90
00:08:43,901 --> 00:08:46,820
All this greed! This money system!

91
00:08:46,987 --> 00:08:49,156
You're destroying everything!

92
00:08:49,907 --> 00:08:51,825
Okay, Barbara, okay.

93
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:54,245
Keep your voice down.

94
00:08:54,995 --> 00:08:56,997
I got friends here.

95
00:08:58,333 --> 00:08:59,292
Sugar!

96
00:08:59,668 --> 00:09:01,086
Hit me one more time.

97
00:09:01,169 --> 00:09:02,587
Stop flirting with the waitress.

98
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:04,005
God. Here.

99
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,342
Go over to the roulette...

100
00:09:08,927 --> 00:09:10,679
...play our anniversary...

101
00:09:10,762 --> 00:09:12,847
...and stay off of black.

102
00:09:16,017 --> 00:09:16,851
Thanks.

103
00:09:25,402 --> 00:09:28,071
Make it quick,
we go out live in ten minutes.

104
00:09:28,905 --> 00:09:31,283
What? The actual president?

105
00:09:31,491 --> 00:09:32,659
Cutting in?

106
00:09:36,913 --> 00:09:40,083
Budget negotiations may be dead
in the water after this week.

107
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:41,793
Hair looks good.

108
00:09:43,169 --> 00:09:44,254
I like the hair.

109
00:09:44,337 --> 00:09:46,506
...quote, ''factually-challenged. ''

110
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,092
Yeah, Stone. Speak.

111
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:50,760
Jason, hi, it's me.

112
00:09:51,928 --> 00:09:53,388
You wearing a bra?

113
00:09:53,847 --> 00:09:57,642
Listen, this is big. President Dale
is cutting into my show today.

114
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:02,148
That's absurd. Why would he stoop
to being on ''Today in Fashion''?

115
00:10:02,231 --> 00:10:03,691
He's interrupting everybody.

116
00:10:03,774 --> 00:10:07,194
I don't know, it's some sort of
an emergency announcement.

117
00:10:07,361 --> 00:10:10,072
This doesn't make sense.
He should talk to us.

118
00:10:11,115 --> 00:10:13,159
White House is coming out live.

119
00:10:14,118 --> 00:10:16,954
Good evening, my fellow Americans.

120
00:10:17,288 --> 00:10:20,958
I apologize for interrupting
your regular programs...

121
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:24,128
...but I have a very important
announcement to make.

122
00:10:24,629 --> 00:10:27,715
Many important things have happened
to me in my life:

123
00:10:28,216 --> 00:10:30,468
My graduation from Princeton...

124
00:10:30,968 --> 00:10:34,472
...the day that Marsha said
she would be my wife...

125
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:36,891
...the birth of our daughter Taffy.

126
00:10:37,058 --> 00:10:38,059
Thanks, Dad.

127
00:10:38,142 --> 00:10:42,813
And the news that I have heard today
ranks right up there.

128
00:10:43,064 --> 00:10:45,316
A powerful memory is in the making.

129
00:10:45,983 --> 00:10:47,735
Not just for me...

130
00:10:47,902 --> 00:10:49,737
...but for all mankind.

131
00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:51,030
Today...

132
00:10:51,072 --> 00:10:54,659
...an extraordinary discovery
was made by the Hubble telescope.

133
00:10:56,787 --> 00:10:59,706
The data from the Hubble was decoded...

134
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:05,170
...then analyzed by the most
powerful computers at MIT.

135
00:11:05,796 --> 00:11:08,048
The images are undeniable.

136
00:11:08,549 --> 00:11:11,718
We are entering the dawn of a new era.

137
00:11:12,886 --> 00:11:16,723
Frame enlargements provide
an astonishing sight.

138
00:11:16,974 --> 00:11:21,562
A fleet of vehicles,
which can best be described as...

139
00:11:21,812 --> 00:11:23,397
...flying saucers.

140
00:11:23,564 --> 00:11:26,733
Come on! Come on!
Papa needs a new pair of shoes!

141
00:11:29,736 --> 00:11:32,406
Hey, am I the only one
shooting craps here?

142
00:11:32,573 --> 00:11:36,285
We hope we will have the chance
to meet with them.

143
00:11:36,451 --> 00:11:39,204
This is the perfect summation
to the 20th Century....

144
00:11:39,288 --> 00:11:40,706
Martians.

145
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:43,208
This is great.

146
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:46,378
Please, come to Earth. Please.

147
00:11:47,045 --> 00:11:48,380
We need you.

148
00:11:52,551 --> 00:11:54,636
I got people coming in!

149
00:11:54,803 --> 00:11:57,639
Everybody wants to be part of this.

150
00:11:57,724 --> 00:12:00,560
Galaxy's going to be world class.

151
00:12:01,644 --> 00:12:02,979
And soon...

152
00:12:03,146 --> 00:12:06,149
...we will become one solar system.

153
00:12:06,649 --> 00:12:07,984
What the hell's he talking about?

154
00:12:08,067 --> 00:12:10,653
These flying saucers
have come from Mars...

155
00:12:12,405 --> 00:12:14,991
...and at their current course and speed...

156
00:12:15,325 --> 00:12:16,993
...will enter Earth's orbit in 16 hours.

157
00:12:17,076 --> 00:12:20,997
I've been thinking about Martians
when there weren't any.

158
00:12:21,414 --> 00:12:26,002
It is profoundly moving to know
there is intelligent life out there.

159
00:12:26,169 --> 00:12:27,670
Glad it's somewhere.

160
00:12:27,754 --> 00:12:31,591
Our world
will never feel quite the same again.

161
00:12:33,176 --> 00:12:34,427
Good night...

162
00:12:35,428 --> 00:12:37,305
...and God bless you all.

163
00:12:47,857 --> 00:12:49,192
This...

164
00:12:50,109 --> 00:12:51,694
...is intense.

165
00:12:54,364 --> 00:12:56,449
Shut up, Poppy. Shut up.

166
00:12:57,534 --> 00:12:58,869
Shut up!

167
00:12:59,536 --> 00:13:00,746
Jason Stone.

168
00:13:03,624 --> 00:13:04,875
It's for you.

169
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:09,213
Poppy, honey. No, sweetie.

170
00:13:10,881 --> 00:13:13,050
That's right. Good girl.

171
00:13:16,971 --> 00:13:18,597
I could be there at...

172
00:13:19,223 --> 00:13:21,225
...I don't know, 11:00.

173
00:13:36,657 --> 00:13:40,160
They want me to interview
the professor from the White House.

174
00:13:40,828 --> 00:13:41,870
Kessler?

175
00:13:43,497 --> 00:13:44,582
Donald Kessler?

176
00:13:44,665 --> 00:13:46,709
Yeah, I think that was his name.

177
00:13:47,543 --> 00:13:48,919
You know, the science guy.

178
00:13:49,003 --> 00:13:50,838
This is nuts, this is....

179
00:13:51,171 --> 00:13:53,090
We should have got that guy.

180
00:13:53,507 --> 00:13:55,676
Your people are too slow.

181
00:13:57,012 --> 00:13:58,263
Right, Poppy?

182
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,121
Finished!

183
00:14:23,204 --> 00:14:25,040
One minute, 57 seconds.

184
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:28,793
-Didn't I tell you under two minutes?
-You did!

185
00:14:28,877 --> 00:14:29,878
You did!

186
00:14:29,961 --> 00:14:31,046
Hot damn.

187
00:14:31,796 --> 00:14:33,173
Want a doughnut?

188
00:14:33,465 --> 00:14:34,549
How old are they?

189
00:14:34,633 --> 00:14:36,051
Fresh baked, Monday.

190
00:14:36,134 --> 00:14:38,803
Richie, that's six days ago!

191
00:14:39,304 --> 00:14:40,722
Give me a couple.

192
00:14:44,476 --> 00:14:46,895
This Martian thing is pretty awesome.

193
00:14:47,062 --> 00:14:50,815
Did one of you traitors see my Muffy?

194
00:14:50,982 --> 00:14:52,734
Your brother's volunteering.

195
00:14:52,817 --> 00:14:54,986
As soon as I get back to the base.

196
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,321
Volunteer for what?

197
00:14:56,405 --> 00:14:57,907
Martian detail.

198
00:14:58,991 --> 00:14:59,825
Cool.

199
00:14:59,909 --> 00:15:03,496
lf any Martians come around here,
I'll kick their butts!

200
00:15:15,925 --> 00:15:16,926
Jump!

201
00:15:26,477 --> 00:15:28,980
Folks,
we must make an unscheduled stop!

202
00:15:32,358 --> 00:15:33,526
It's Mama.

203
00:15:34,277 --> 00:15:37,530
Why are you here?
lf you ain't home, why ain't you in class?

204
00:15:37,613 --> 00:15:38,698
Class was cancelled.

205
00:15:38,781 --> 00:15:40,199
It was not!

206
00:15:40,366 --> 00:15:41,367
-Come here!
-Why?

207
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:43,244
I'm not going to hurt you.

208
00:15:43,703 --> 00:15:44,954
Let go of him.

209
00:15:46,539 --> 00:15:48,958
Okay. Now just come here.

210
00:15:49,292 --> 00:15:50,543
Come here.

211
00:15:51,794 --> 00:15:53,462
Think it's smart to cut school?

212
00:15:53,546 --> 00:15:55,464
-What are you doing?
-Do you?

213
00:15:56,466 --> 00:15:57,634
No, it's dumb.

214
00:15:57,718 --> 00:15:59,553
You'll flunk! Go to jail!

215
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,555
Get on the bus!

216
00:16:01,722 --> 00:16:02,806
Get on!

217
00:16:03,056 --> 00:16:05,559
I'll be tripping on you. Get back there.

218
00:16:05,726 --> 00:16:07,311
I don't want to hear anymore.

219
00:16:07,394 --> 00:16:08,478
I hate school.

220
00:16:08,562 --> 00:16:09,813
I heard that!

221
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:34,755
Hi, there.

222
00:16:34,838 --> 00:16:36,006
Want a date?

223
00:16:36,173 --> 00:16:37,591
How about it?

224
00:16:37,841 --> 00:16:39,176
A date?

225
00:16:41,511 --> 00:16:42,804
It sounds good.

226
00:16:45,015 --> 00:16:46,850
The stress at work is...

227
00:16:47,184 --> 00:16:48,769
...unbelievable.

228
00:16:54,233 --> 00:16:55,984
May I speak to you in private?

229
00:16:56,069 --> 00:16:58,863
No, I must watch the floor.
What do you want?

230
00:16:59,364 --> 00:17:02,992
-I'm supporting a family back east.
-I thought you were divorced.

231
00:17:03,076 --> 00:17:05,870
I am, but I still have to take care of them.

232
00:17:06,746 --> 00:17:09,874
Things have been a little lean around here.

233
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:12,001
I was wondering if I could get a raise?

234
00:17:12,085 --> 00:17:13,294
Out of the question.

235
00:17:13,378 --> 00:17:16,589
I'm an asset to this hotel.
They like me around here.

236
00:17:16,756 --> 00:17:18,424
You're a nice guy.

237
00:17:18,758 --> 00:17:22,595
But I can get Leon Spinks
or Buster Douglas for the same money.

238
00:17:23,054 --> 00:17:25,932
You better get moving.
You're on in five minutes.

239
00:17:35,108 --> 00:17:37,610
This show's going to get a great rating.

240
00:17:38,403 --> 00:17:39,696
It's all yours.

241
00:17:40,613 --> 00:17:45,577
ln certain circumstances the proposition
that two and two equals five...

242
00:17:45,743 --> 00:17:47,579
...is entirely legitimate.

243
00:17:49,289 --> 00:17:50,707
Call me Nathalie.

244
00:17:51,124 --> 00:17:53,918
And you, do please call me Donald.

245
00:17:55,296 --> 00:17:56,797
I admire your show.

246
00:17:59,258 --> 00:18:01,760
Really? You like my work?

247
00:18:02,136 --> 00:18:04,096
Yes. Very much.

248
00:18:04,263 --> 00:18:05,598
Why....

249
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,933
Thank you.

250
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,852
Coming out of commercial.

251
00:18:09,935 --> 00:18:11,645
In five...four...

252
00:18:11,812 --> 00:18:13,480
...three...two....

253
00:18:13,564 --> 00:18:16,984
Welcome back.
We're with Professor Donald Kessler.

254
00:18:18,944 --> 00:18:22,114
He's the chairman
of the American Academy...

255
00:18:22,281 --> 00:18:24,658
...of Astronautics.

256
00:18:25,826 --> 00:18:27,161
Professor...

257
00:18:27,453 --> 00:18:30,831
...isn't it weird that we sent
a space probe to Mars...

258
00:18:30,998 --> 00:18:33,083
...and we didn't even find anyone?

259
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:35,169
Well, not really...

260
00:18:35,336 --> 00:18:36,545
...Nathalie.

261
00:18:37,004 --> 00:18:39,340
We didn't get into the canals.

262
00:18:39,506 --> 00:18:41,550
The Martian canals are canyons.

263
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,969
Some are over 100 miles deep.

264
00:18:44,178 --> 00:18:49,016
The Martian civilization has clearly
developed under the planet's surface.

265
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:52,895
Their science and technology
must be absolutely mind-boggling.

266
00:18:53,687 --> 00:18:54,605
So...

267
00:18:54,688 --> 00:18:56,690
...what in your view, Donald...

268
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:58,443
...Kessler...

269
00:18:58,526 --> 00:19:02,822
...Chairman, are some of the things
the Martians can teach us, Professor?

270
00:19:05,325 --> 00:19:07,827
Quite a lot about Mars, Nathalie.

271
00:19:11,498 --> 00:19:12,791
She's flirting.

272
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:16,378
But seriously,
this is tremendously exciting.

273
00:19:16,586 --> 00:19:19,673
The knowledge, the new ideas:
it'll change everything.

274
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:22,008
And we must be open to it.

275
00:19:22,175 --> 00:19:24,761
Maybe they can tell us about our universe.

276
00:19:24,844 --> 00:19:26,179
How it started.

277
00:19:26,346 --> 00:19:27,847
Where it's going.

278
00:19:28,014 --> 00:19:30,267
Perhaps even its purpose.

279
00:19:31,017 --> 00:19:32,602
It's tremendously exciting.

280
00:19:32,686 --> 00:19:35,355
It's the most important event since...

281
00:19:35,689 --> 00:19:37,941
...Jesus walked in Galilee--

282
00:19:38,608 --> 00:19:39,776
Christ.

283
00:19:39,943 --> 00:19:41,611
What's wrong?

284
00:19:41,778 --> 00:19:43,029
Go to Camera Two!

285
00:19:43,113 --> 00:19:44,531
I can't. It's busted.

286
00:19:44,614 --> 00:19:46,449
Go to One! Go to Four!

287
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,457
He copped a feel.

288
00:19:57,044 --> 00:19:58,212
Now what?

289
00:20:11,642 --> 00:20:12,852
What's that?

290
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,645
So that's a Martian.

291
00:20:17,899 --> 00:20:19,317
That's a Martian?

292
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,572
Oh, my God!

293
00:20:24,739 --> 00:20:25,698
Yikes!

294
00:20:28,326 --> 00:20:30,703
I'm not having that thing in my house.

295
00:20:32,246 --> 00:20:33,581
Sweetie...

296
00:20:33,748 --> 00:20:36,584
...we may have to.
The people expect me to meet them.

297
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:39,253
They're not eating off the Van Buren china.

298
00:20:41,172 --> 00:20:42,673
Look at that brain.

299
00:20:43,257 --> 00:20:44,842
He must be real smart.

300
00:20:45,009 --> 00:20:47,011
It's gross!

301
00:20:47,762 --> 00:20:49,513
Don't forget, Nathalie...

302
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,266
...that we will look equally gross to him.

303
00:20:57,272 --> 00:20:59,441
He made the international sign
of the doughnut.

304
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:04,363
From the limited information available,
I've made three extrapolations. One:

305
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:07,366
Our Martian friend
is a carbon-based life form.

306
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:09,701
Two: He breathes nitrogen.

307
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:10,953
And three:

308
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:14,039
The large cerebrum here, indicates...

309
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:16,458
...telepathic potential.

310
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,377
You mean they can...

311
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,045
...read our thoughts?

312
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,131
Potentially, yes.

313
00:21:23,298 --> 00:21:25,467
What about their intentions?

314
00:21:25,634 --> 00:21:27,302
Are they friendly people?

315
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:32,224
Logic dictates that given
their high level of technical development...

316
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:34,476
...they're an advanced culture.

317
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,396
Therefore, peaceful and enlightened.

318
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,566
The human race, on the other hand...

319
00:21:40,983 --> 00:21:43,986
...is an aggressively dangerous species.

320
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:47,990
Now I suspect they have
more to fear from us...

321
00:21:48,156 --> 00:21:49,741
...than we from them.

322
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:51,577
Doctor.

323
00:21:51,994 --> 00:21:53,120
Thank you.

324
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:58,083
For many years,
I've been refining a translating computer.

325
00:21:59,002 --> 00:22:01,921
The results are not perfect, but this...

326
00:22:02,088 --> 00:22:04,424
...may answer some of your questions.

327
00:22:10,221 --> 00:22:11,806
Green skin...

328
00:22:12,557 --> 00:22:14,726
...800 centuries ago.

329
00:22:15,143 --> 00:22:16,728
Their bodily fluids...

330
00:22:16,895 --> 00:22:19,397
...include the birth of half-breeds.

331
00:22:19,814 --> 00:22:21,357
How many centuries did he say?

332
00:22:21,441 --> 00:22:22,442
Eight hundred, sir.

333
00:22:22,525 --> 00:22:24,819
Self-determination of the cosmos.

334
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:28,406
For dark is the suede that...

335
00:22:28,573 --> 00:22:29,741
...mows...

336
00:22:29,991 --> 00:22:32,076
...like a harvest.

337
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,621
What the hell does that mean?

338
00:22:49,677 --> 00:22:50,845
Hey, Mitch.

339
00:22:50,929 --> 00:22:52,222
Good morning.

340
00:22:52,347 --> 00:22:55,934
I'm sorry, you can't come this way.
There's a tour in progress.

341
00:23:04,944 --> 00:23:06,737
Hello, my name is Barbara.

342
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,489
Hello, Barbara.

343
00:23:09,156 --> 00:23:13,327
I am an alcoholic,
but I haven't had a drink in three months.

344
00:23:19,959 --> 00:23:23,295
I'm feeling so optimistic
because of the Martians.

345
00:23:23,963 --> 00:23:26,382
We're not alone in the universe.

346
00:23:26,715 --> 00:23:28,717
And it's so perfect...

347
00:23:28,884 --> 00:23:32,429
...that it's happening at the beginning
of the new millennium.

348
00:23:32,638 --> 00:23:34,557
Our planet was suffering...

349
00:23:34,723 --> 00:23:38,143
...with the ozone and the rain forest and...

350
00:23:39,728 --> 00:23:42,898
...so many people unhappy in their lives.

351
00:23:43,649 --> 00:23:44,817
And then...

352
00:23:45,484 --> 00:23:49,071
...the Martians heard
our global karmic cry for help.

353
00:23:49,655 --> 00:23:51,156
People say they're ugly...

354
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,993
...but I think they've come
to show us the way.

355
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:58,415
I think they've come to save us.

356
00:24:01,376 --> 00:24:02,502
Thank you.

357
00:24:15,181 --> 00:24:16,266
Bye-bye.

358
00:24:16,349 --> 00:24:19,269
You be careful. Don't get yourself killed.

359
00:24:19,436 --> 00:24:20,854
Ain't she cute?

360
00:24:21,021 --> 00:24:23,440
-We're real proud of you.
-Thanks, Dad.

361
00:24:24,774 --> 00:24:26,192
Let me take this.

362
00:24:27,694 --> 00:24:31,698
So long, retard. Don't touch
any of my stuff while I'm gone.

363
00:24:33,783 --> 00:24:35,201
Bye-bye, Grandma.

364
00:24:35,368 --> 00:24:36,620
Good-bye, Thomas.

365
00:24:36,703 --> 00:24:38,121
It's Billy-Glenn, Grandma.

366
00:24:38,204 --> 00:24:39,789
I know, Thomas.

367
00:24:41,708 --> 00:24:43,043
Bye-bye, honey.

368
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,046
I must go.

369
00:24:59,227 --> 00:25:00,770
Take care of my boy.

370
00:25:11,906 --> 00:25:13,074
He'll be all right.

371
00:25:13,157 --> 00:25:14,283
I hope so.

372
00:25:14,367 --> 00:25:15,993
Army trains them good.

373
00:25:21,415 --> 00:25:23,000
He's gone for a while.

374
00:25:23,834 --> 00:25:26,337
Why can't you be more like your brother?

375
00:25:26,504 --> 00:25:30,758
We got lucky with Billy-Glenn.
You can't expect the same luck twice.

376
00:25:31,342 --> 00:25:34,512
Richie, want to make yourself useful
for a change?

377
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:35,763
Sure, Dad.

378
00:25:35,846 --> 00:25:37,848
Take Grandma back to the home.

379
00:25:51,862 --> 00:25:55,324
I bet you never thought you'd live
to see the Martians come.

380
00:25:55,784 --> 00:25:57,703
It's pretty far out.

381
00:25:59,788 --> 00:26:03,458
But think of all the crazy things
you must have seen.

382
00:26:03,959 --> 00:26:07,462
I bet people were pretty scared
when they invented the train.

383
00:26:08,046 --> 00:26:10,799
Come on, kid, I'm not that old!

384
00:26:14,303 --> 00:26:15,554
Are you okay?

385
00:26:17,222 --> 00:26:18,807
I want to see Slim.

386
00:26:18,974 --> 00:26:20,309
I want to see...

387
00:26:20,475 --> 00:26:21,727
...Slim...

388
00:26:21,894 --> 00:26:23,228
...and Muffy...

389
00:26:23,645 --> 00:26:24,980
...and Richie.

390
00:26:27,983 --> 00:26:29,526
Grandma, I'm Richie.

391
00:26:31,069 --> 00:26:32,988
I know, Thomas.

392
00:26:33,322 --> 00:26:35,908
Richie was always the best one.

393
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:43,165
Right now the president
is talking to other world leaders.

394
00:26:43,248 --> 00:26:46,835
They're preparing a list of issues
of common interest to discuss.

395
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:51,340
There is a unilateral, concerted,
diplomatic effort being made.

396
00:26:53,842 --> 00:26:54,593
Jason.

397
00:26:54,677 --> 00:26:55,428
Thanks.

398
00:26:55,511 --> 00:26:59,349
lf the Martians land,
can the press do interviews?

399
00:27:00,183 --> 00:27:01,684
Well, that depends.

400
00:27:01,768 --> 00:27:03,937
We must establish contact...

401
00:27:04,103 --> 00:27:06,272
...work out communication problems...

402
00:27:06,356 --> 00:27:07,690
...establish parameters.

403
00:27:07,774 --> 00:27:10,193
Then I guess we just see what happens.

404
00:27:10,526 --> 00:27:12,111
Here's the president.

405
00:27:14,447 --> 00:27:15,782
Good morning.

406
00:27:15,949 --> 00:27:18,284
It's nice to see you all again.

407
00:27:18,451 --> 00:27:22,205
I just have a few minutes for questions,
so let's get started.

408
00:27:22,372 --> 00:27:23,623
Mr. President!

409
00:27:26,542 --> 00:27:29,712
Do the Martians have two sexes,
like we do?

410
00:27:47,647 --> 00:27:48,898
From Hollywood...

411
00:27:48,982 --> 00:27:52,485
...we bring you the ''Lawrence Welk Show''!

412
00:27:57,741 --> 00:28:02,079
Here he is, Mr. Music Maker himself,
Lawrence Welk.

413
00:28:11,338 --> 00:28:15,175
This pussycat
is the most beautiful pussycat...

414
00:28:15,342 --> 00:28:17,595
...in the whole world.

415
00:28:17,761 --> 00:28:19,430
That's my Muffy.

416
00:28:24,268 --> 00:28:27,104
Didn't you ever have
a pussycat of your own?

417
00:28:27,271 --> 00:28:28,522
Sure, Grandma.

418
00:28:28,772 --> 00:28:30,524
Music!

419
00:28:35,779 --> 00:28:37,031
There you go.

420
00:28:41,702 --> 00:28:43,454
You going to be okay?

421
00:28:44,371 --> 00:28:48,375
lf you need anything,
any doughnuts or anything, call me.

422
00:29:14,611 --> 00:29:15,946
How do?

423
00:29:17,197 --> 00:29:20,617
Looks like you ain't got no wheels.
Come on...

424
00:29:20,951 --> 00:29:22,369
...get in.

425
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,209
I'm going to do you a favor.

426
00:29:29,376 --> 00:29:30,460
I owe you one.

427
00:29:30,543 --> 00:29:34,631
I made a ton of money
on your last fight in '73.

428
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:36,424
The Quaker in Jamaica.

429
00:29:37,217 --> 00:29:38,802
I'm glad somebody did.

430
00:29:38,969 --> 00:29:41,054
Yeah, I know, I know.

431
00:29:41,221 --> 00:29:42,764
It's rough on jocks.

432
00:29:43,306 --> 00:29:45,141
You get to a certain age...

433
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,185
...opportunities dry up.

434
00:29:48,228 --> 00:29:49,980
So here's the deal.

435
00:29:50,146 --> 00:29:54,317
I got this chum, owes me a lot of money,
needs a wake-up call.

436
00:29:54,402 --> 00:29:56,654
What I'd like you to do is...

437
00:29:56,821 --> 00:29:59,740
...use that patented left hook on him.

438
00:30:00,658 --> 00:30:03,578
Just in the ring, Art. Just in the ring.

439
00:30:03,744 --> 00:30:06,247
Yeah, I'm hip, I'm hip, but...

440
00:30:06,831 --> 00:30:08,833
...I'll give you two grand.

441
00:30:09,917 --> 00:30:11,502
When you're done...

442
00:30:11,669 --> 00:30:15,756
...all you must do is mosey on
by the office and get the cash.

443
00:30:16,007 --> 00:30:18,092
Why do you want to come at me that way?

444
00:30:18,175 --> 00:30:20,511
I'm trying to get back with my wife.

445
00:30:20,678 --> 00:30:23,097
We had problems with this kind of shit.

446
00:30:23,931 --> 00:30:25,683
But I've changed, man.

447
00:30:25,933 --> 00:30:27,018
I found Allah...

448
00:30:27,101 --> 00:30:29,604
...I don't eat pork, I'm a better man.

449
00:30:30,688 --> 00:30:33,774
I faced that demon
and I don't want him coming again.

450
00:30:36,027 --> 00:30:38,029
You gave up pork!

451
00:30:45,244 --> 00:30:47,163
They're sending coordinates.

452
00:30:53,127 --> 00:30:54,211
Where are they landing?

453
00:30:54,296 --> 00:30:56,506
Pahrump. It's in the Nevada desert.

454
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:59,760
I can have my troops there at 0800 hours,
sir.

455
00:30:59,968 --> 00:31:03,639
We must not send these people
the wrong message.

456
00:31:03,805 --> 00:31:05,933
We need a welcome mat, not tanks!

457
00:31:06,099 --> 00:31:10,646
What are you talking about? You can't
have Martians running all over Nevada!

458
00:31:10,812 --> 00:31:12,064
You're right.

459
00:31:12,147 --> 00:31:15,025
-Thank you, sir.
-This situation needs to be supervised.

460
00:31:15,108 --> 00:31:16,610
Absolutely, sir.

461
00:31:16,777 --> 00:31:18,278
General Casey...

462
00:31:18,487 --> 00:31:20,155
...can you handle it?

463
00:31:20,822 --> 00:31:21,907
I'd be proud.

464
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:24,451
Good, but keep a lid on it.

465
00:31:24,618 --> 00:31:27,496
Key media, good cross-section of guests.

466
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:31,124
We don't want it to turn
into a zoo out there.

467
00:31:40,467 --> 00:31:43,053
They don't know what
they're talking about!

468
00:31:43,136 --> 00:31:45,347
Liberals, intellectuals...

469
00:31:45,514 --> 00:31:47,849
...peacemongers, idiots!

470
00:31:49,518 --> 00:31:51,853
Would you please keep it down?

471
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,689
People live here!

472
00:32:17,755 --> 00:32:19,007
General Casey.

473
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:23,720
Yes, I get to greet the Martian ambassador.

474
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,889
Isn't that great?

475
00:32:26,055 --> 00:32:28,933
Oh, it's a hell of an honor.

476
00:32:29,392 --> 00:32:33,938
Didn't I always tell you if I stayed
in place and never spoke up...

477
00:32:34,105 --> 00:32:36,566
...good things were bound to happen?

478
00:33:43,634 --> 00:33:47,179
I want the Martians to be treated
like foreign dignitaries.

479
00:33:47,346 --> 00:33:49,974
I want your men alert and majestic...

480
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:52,643
...with a snap in their step.

481
00:33:53,853 --> 00:33:56,523
This must look good.
The world is watching.

482
00:33:56,606 --> 00:33:57,691
Yes, sir.

483
00:34:02,862 --> 00:34:05,240
Are you positive this thing will work?

484
00:34:06,324 --> 00:34:08,034
Positively positive.

485
00:34:08,201 --> 00:34:09,786
We don't want any slip-ups.

486
00:34:09,869 --> 00:34:11,997
No, no, no, no. Not at all.

487
00:34:33,518 --> 00:34:36,313
Poppy. All these people.

488
00:34:37,147 --> 00:34:39,524
All of them here to see you.

489
00:34:42,319 --> 00:34:44,154
There's Jason, Poppy!

490
00:34:57,001 --> 00:34:58,502
Okay, let's go.

491
00:35:00,713 --> 00:35:04,091
The teeming masses have gathered
from who knows how many states...

492
00:35:04,175 --> 00:35:06,010
...waiting and watching.

493
00:35:06,218 --> 00:35:07,595
Why have they come?

494
00:35:07,678 --> 00:35:10,056
Curiosity? Or is it something more?

495
00:35:10,389 --> 00:35:13,100
Or simply to say, 'I was there'?

496
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:14,936
'I was there...

497
00:35:15,102 --> 00:35:16,687
'...when first man...

498
00:35:16,771 --> 00:35:18,272
'...met Martian.'

499
00:35:18,898 --> 00:35:19,815
Jason Stone...

500
00:35:19,899 --> 00:35:21,234
...GNN...

501
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,443
...Pahrump.

502
00:35:55,477 --> 00:35:56,645
Some room.

503
00:35:56,812 --> 00:35:58,605
Give them room.

504
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:52,701
It is an awesome sight.

505
00:36:52,868 --> 00:36:55,829
The giant spacecraft glinting...

506
00:36:55,997 --> 00:36:58,666
...in the Nevada sun like a...

507
00:36:59,334 --> 00:37:00,668
...giant...

508
00:37:01,169 --> 00:37:02,670
...hubcap.

509
00:37:04,339 --> 00:37:06,007
Something's happening.

510
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:13,056
The doorway...

511
00:37:13,223 --> 00:37:14,474
...is opening.

512
00:37:18,686 --> 00:37:20,563
A silver ramp...

513
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:22,232
...is coming out...

514
00:37:23,191 --> 00:37:25,026
...like a giant tongue.

515
00:37:49,092 --> 00:37:50,760
Gee whiz.

516
00:38:19,081 --> 00:38:20,416
Martians!

517
00:38:21,417 --> 00:38:23,127
Funny little critters.

518
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,168
Well?

519
00:39:04,127 --> 00:39:05,045
Wait.

520
00:39:08,798 --> 00:39:09,925
Greetings.

521
00:39:10,133 --> 00:39:12,636
I am the Martian ambassador.

522
00:39:15,138 --> 00:39:17,807
Everything is fixed now. You may speak.

523
00:39:17,974 --> 00:39:19,309
Greetings.

524
00:39:19,476 --> 00:39:21,061
I am General Casey...

525
00:39:21,144 --> 00:39:25,815
...Commanding Officer of the Armed
Forces of the United States of America.

526
00:39:26,191 --> 00:39:28,818
On behalf of the people of Earth:

527
00:39:28,985 --> 00:39:30,028
Welcome.

528
00:39:30,862 --> 00:39:32,280
He did that well.

529
00:40:02,562 --> 00:40:04,063
We come in peace.

530
00:40:04,897 --> 00:40:07,066
We come in peace. We come in peace.

531
00:40:11,988 --> 00:40:14,156
They came in peace.

532
00:40:17,326 --> 00:40:18,995
We come in peace.

533
00:40:48,357 --> 00:40:49,442
Open fire!

534
00:41:21,058 --> 00:41:22,226
What?

535
00:42:11,859 --> 00:42:14,362
Die, you alien shithead!

536
00:42:20,952 --> 00:42:22,161
I surrender!

537
00:42:29,794 --> 00:42:32,380
No, it ain't happening! It didn't happen!

538
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:31,398
Holy Mother of God!

539
00:43:32,066 --> 00:43:33,525
Did you see that?

540
00:43:33,692 --> 00:43:37,154
We should hit these assholes
with everything we've got, sir.

541
00:43:37,738 --> 00:43:39,281
Sir, Mr. President,
I know this seems terrible...

542
00:43:39,365 --> 00:43:41,325
...but let's not be too rash.

543
00:43:41,408 --> 00:43:42,952
We should nuke them!

544
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:46,205
We must establish
a line of communication first.

545
00:43:46,872 --> 00:43:48,582
Set up a town hall.

546
00:43:48,749 --> 00:43:50,793
We'll get the public's opinion.

547
00:43:52,754 --> 00:43:54,547
What do you think?

548
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:58,051
Kick the crap out of them.

549
00:43:59,552 --> 00:44:01,179
Ladies and gentlemen...

550
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:03,807
...it may be a cultural misunderstanding.

551
00:44:04,557 --> 00:44:06,560
Maybe to them, doves mean war.

552
00:44:08,478 --> 00:44:11,481
We all saw how they reacted to that dove.

553
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:13,316
It frightened them.

554
00:44:13,733 --> 00:44:15,902
He did say that...

555
00:44:17,904 --> 00:44:20,073
...''We come in peace.''

556
00:44:29,916 --> 00:44:32,002
The new computer's ready.

557
00:44:32,168 --> 00:44:34,170
Okay, let's do it.

558
00:44:34,337 --> 00:44:36,923
I know we're making the right decision.

559
00:44:39,926 --> 00:44:41,428
Ready to transmit.

560
00:44:43,513 --> 00:44:47,267
This is the president of the United States.

561
00:44:48,184 --> 00:44:50,020
I'm speaking in the hope...

562
00:44:50,186 --> 00:44:53,565
...that what happened earlier today
in the Nevada desert...

563
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:57,111
...was a cultural misunderstanding.

564
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:00,865
There can be no doubt
that we two peoples...

565
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:04,285
...have a great deal to offer one another.

566
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:06,454
You must be as excited as we...

567
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:09,832
...to find intelligent life in the solar system.

568
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,877
Let me make it clear.

569
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:14,712
You have nothing...

570
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,881
...to fear from us.

571
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:20,468
Our customs may be strange to you...

572
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:23,304
...but we mean no harm.

573
00:46:35,294 --> 00:46:37,879
When the investors fly in...

574
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:41,049
...I would like for them each to be...

575
00:46:42,384 --> 00:46:43,885
...met by a limo.

576
00:46:44,886 --> 00:46:47,306
Top of the line cars...

577
00:46:47,889 --> 00:46:50,225
...leather interiors...

578
00:46:50,809 --> 00:46:53,228
...Corinthian, if they got it.

579
00:46:54,063 --> 00:46:57,483
Are you still spinning your wheels
on that cockamamie hotel?

580
00:46:58,902 --> 00:47:00,153
Hello!

581
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:02,822
The Martians have attacked!

582
00:47:02,989 --> 00:47:07,076
This was no misunderstanding.
I was there. I saw it.

583
00:47:07,243 --> 00:47:09,662
Look, you're worried about yesterday.

584
00:47:09,996 --> 00:47:11,998
I'm worried about tomorrow.

585
00:47:12,165 --> 00:47:15,752
The Martians land on Earth,
they'll need a place to stay.

586
00:47:15,919 --> 00:47:17,629
Just like everyone else.

587
00:47:18,421 --> 00:47:19,923
My God.

588
00:47:21,257 --> 00:47:24,010
Maybe we should all be destroyed.

589
00:47:25,011 --> 00:47:28,181
The human race doesn't deserve to live.

590
00:47:35,188 --> 00:47:36,356
Ethel...

591
00:47:36,522 --> 00:47:38,274
...that reminds me.

592
00:47:38,441 --> 00:47:40,860
I'd like the limos to be stocked...

593
00:47:41,027 --> 00:47:44,113
...with every kind of alcohol
known to man.

594
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:47,033
And top it off with a bottle of Dom...

595
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,701
...on ice.

596
00:47:49,702 --> 00:47:52,956
What confounds me most of all
is the lack of genitalia.

597
00:47:53,123 --> 00:47:55,042
Down here is the aorta.

598
00:47:55,209 --> 00:47:57,711
Up here we have the sphinx.

599
00:47:58,045 --> 00:48:01,215
Notice the highly developed
nerve system here.

600
00:48:01,382 --> 00:48:04,885
This explains, of course,
the cerebral arteries.

601
00:48:05,052 --> 00:48:08,722
And if we notice down here,
behind the optic chiasm...

602
00:48:09,473 --> 00:48:11,558
...several glands....

603
00:48:15,312 --> 00:48:17,147
Very curious.

604
00:48:59,774 --> 00:49:04,362
''He who believes in me,
though he die, yet shall he live.

605
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:09,284
''And whoever lives and believes in me
shall never die.''

606
00:49:10,452 --> 00:49:13,788
Billy-Glenn Norris gave his life
defending our country.

607
00:49:13,955 --> 00:49:15,874
Why did it have to be him?

608
00:49:16,041 --> 00:49:20,045
He's a true American hero.
May God rest his soul.

609
00:49:21,713 --> 00:49:23,548
Ready! Aim.

610
00:49:25,133 --> 00:49:26,134
Fire!

611
00:49:27,552 --> 00:49:28,637
Aim!

612
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:30,055
Fire!

613
00:49:42,734 --> 00:49:43,944
Hello?

614
00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:47,489
Byron! Is everything all right?
You still coming tomorrow?

615
00:49:47,572 --> 00:49:51,076
Just try and stop me.
That plane arrives at 4:00 p.m.

616
00:49:51,284 --> 00:49:52,786
Are the kids there?

617
00:49:52,954 --> 00:49:54,288
Yeah, hold on.

618
00:49:57,458 --> 00:49:59,126
-Me first.
-No, me.

619
00:50:02,755 --> 00:50:03,547
Hey, Dad.

620
00:50:03,631 --> 00:50:05,633
Who's that? Neville?

621
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:07,301
How are you?

622
00:50:07,385 --> 00:50:09,303
We're going to the White House.

623
00:50:09,387 --> 00:50:10,972
The White House?

624
00:50:11,138 --> 00:50:12,390
Yeah, tomorrow.

625
00:50:12,556 --> 00:50:14,558
-Give it back!
-Leave me alone.

626
00:50:14,725 --> 00:50:16,978
It's a school thing, like a tour.

627
00:50:17,144 --> 00:50:20,064
So you're still going to school
once in a while?

628
00:50:21,566 --> 00:50:22,984
Give me your ma again.

629
00:50:23,067 --> 00:50:24,068
Hold on.

630
00:50:24,151 --> 00:50:24,986
Mom.

631
00:50:25,236 --> 00:50:27,989
-You always get to the phone first.
-So what?

632
00:50:28,656 --> 00:50:30,241
I'm first to the game.

633
00:50:32,326 --> 00:50:35,413
Why are you wasting this phone time?
I'll see you tomorrow.

634
00:50:35,496 --> 00:50:38,082
But there's something
I want to say to you.

635
00:50:38,249 --> 00:50:40,668
Just 'cause I feel like saying it.

636
00:50:40,918 --> 00:50:42,128
What's that?

637
00:50:42,837 --> 00:50:44,255
I love you.

638
00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:47,925
I love you too, Byron.

639
00:50:48,092 --> 00:50:51,178
Now stop wasting money!
I'll see you tomorrow!

640
00:51:08,697 --> 00:51:10,198
They're responding.

641
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:15,537
A message from the Martians.

642
00:51:17,956 --> 00:51:18,874
Really?

643
00:51:18,957 --> 00:51:21,043
They've issued a formal apology.

644
00:51:22,961 --> 00:51:25,047
This is great!

645
00:51:25,797 --> 00:51:27,716
I told you this would happen.

646
00:51:27,883 --> 00:51:32,054
The Martian ambassador feels terrible
and wants to speak to Congress.

647
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:33,805
That's good, isn't it?

648
00:51:33,972 --> 00:51:35,474
You bet.

649
00:51:36,058 --> 00:51:38,393
It's a victory for our administration.

650
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:54,555
Ladies and gentlemen.

651
00:52:54,722 --> 00:52:57,808
This is a proud day for all Americans.

652
00:52:58,392 --> 00:53:01,645
This is a hell of a photo-op, Jerry.

653
00:53:02,229 --> 00:53:04,398
Are you sure I shouldn't be there?

654
00:53:04,565 --> 00:53:08,319
The Secret Service don't want
the executive branch...

655
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:11,572
...and the legislative branch
in the same room.

656
00:53:12,656 --> 00:53:15,659
The Martian ambassador
is going to say a few words.

657
00:53:16,243 --> 00:53:18,412
Come on down, Mr. Ambassador!

658
00:54:26,481 --> 00:54:28,191
Mr. Ambassador, please!

659
00:54:33,989 --> 00:54:34,990
Please!

660
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:37,158
This doesn't make sense!

661
00:54:37,325 --> 00:54:39,327
It's not logical! It's not--

662
00:54:41,329 --> 00:54:43,081
Guess it wasn't the dove.

663
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:45,917
Fire!

664
00:54:51,757 --> 00:54:53,759
They blew up Congress!

665
00:55:15,865 --> 00:55:17,950
Why'd they do that?

666
00:55:18,159 --> 00:55:21,037
Maybe they don't like the human being.

667
00:55:39,013 --> 00:55:40,514
Hello, gentlemen.

668
00:55:40,681 --> 00:55:42,850
Nice of you to come on...

669
00:55:43,017 --> 00:55:44,852
...such short notice.

670
00:55:45,770 --> 00:55:47,271
General Decker...

671
00:55:47,438 --> 00:55:49,857
...it seems I owe you an apology.

672
00:55:50,107 --> 00:55:52,777
We all make mistakes, Mr. President.

673
00:55:52,945 --> 00:55:54,863
Not anymore.

674
00:55:55,197 --> 00:55:58,367
We're going to take charge of this thing!

675
00:55:58,617 --> 00:56:00,994
Excellent. I have prepared the order.

676
00:56:01,703 --> 00:56:02,871
What's this?

677
00:56:02,955 --> 00:56:06,291
Your executive order for full use
of our nuclear deterrent.

678
00:56:09,962 --> 00:56:12,547
Are you crazy? I'm not starting a war!

679
00:56:12,714 --> 00:56:16,802
We're already at war, sir! We have
to nuke them! We must nuke them now!

680
00:56:18,053 --> 00:56:21,473
General Decker, if you do not shut up...

681
00:56:21,890 --> 00:56:24,142
...I'll relieve you of your command.

682
00:56:24,309 --> 00:56:26,144
We must strike now, sir!

683
00:56:26,311 --> 00:56:28,313
Annihilate! Kill! Kill!

684
00:56:28,814 --> 00:56:29,815
Shut up!

685
00:56:29,982 --> 00:56:32,234
Shut up! Shut up!

686
00:56:57,927 --> 00:56:59,095
Now...

687
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:03,433
...I want the people to know...

688
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:06,853
...that they still have two out of three
branches of government...

689
00:57:06,936 --> 00:57:09,606
...working for them, and that ain't bad.

690
00:57:09,772 --> 00:57:14,694
I want the people to know
that the schools will still be open, okay?

691
00:57:15,278 --> 00:57:17,614
And I want the people to know...

692
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:20,867
...that the garbage will still be carried out.

693
00:57:21,034 --> 00:57:22,702
And I want a cop...

694
00:57:22,869 --> 00:57:24,287
...on every corner.

695
00:57:24,370 --> 00:57:26,205
Which, incidentally...

696
00:57:26,372 --> 00:57:28,708
...we would already have...

697
00:57:28,875 --> 00:57:31,878
...if they had listened to me
in the last election.

698
00:57:35,048 --> 00:57:36,382
Jerry...

699
00:57:36,549 --> 00:57:38,718
...how soon can we go on the air?

700
00:57:44,223 --> 00:57:46,726
My fellow Americans.

701
00:57:47,226 --> 00:57:49,395
It is with a heavy heart...

702
00:57:49,562 --> 00:57:51,981
...that I speak to you this afternoon.

703
00:57:52,149 --> 00:57:53,400
As you know...

704
00:57:53,484 --> 00:57:58,405
...earlier today the Martian ambassador
and his confederates...

705
00:57:58,656 --> 00:58:00,407
...attacked and killed...

706
00:58:00,574 --> 00:58:04,745
...many of your representatives
on Capitol Hill.

707
00:58:05,329 --> 00:58:10,000
I will be conferring
with other world leaders as time goes on.

708
00:58:10,751 --> 00:58:14,672
And rest assured that, working together...

709
00:58:15,089 --> 00:58:17,758
...we will soon come out...

710
00:58:18,676 --> 00:58:21,595
...at a very real outcome.

711
00:58:23,847 --> 00:58:25,266
Thank you.

712
00:58:54,296 --> 00:58:56,047
Nathalie, is that you?

713
00:58:56,798 --> 00:58:58,049
Yes.

714
00:58:58,216 --> 00:58:59,384
How're you?

715
00:59:01,428 --> 00:59:03,513
Not terribly good, I'm afraid.

716
00:59:05,390 --> 00:59:07,142
May I ask you a question?

717
00:59:09,978 --> 00:59:11,563
Of course you can.

718
00:59:12,731 --> 00:59:15,150
Were you flirting with me on the show?

719
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,568
Because...

720
00:59:16,818 --> 00:59:18,236
...if you were...

721
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:20,155
...I just want you to know...

722
00:59:20,238 --> 00:59:22,073
...that I liked it.

723
00:59:23,575 --> 00:59:24,826
You did?

724
00:59:24,993 --> 00:59:25,994
Really?

725
00:59:26,077 --> 00:59:29,497
Because, you know,
I've watched you on TV quite a bit and...

726
00:59:29,581 --> 00:59:30,957
...well, I've...

727
00:59:31,416 --> 00:59:34,419
...had something of
a schoolboycrush on you for...

728
00:59:34,586 --> 00:59:35,837
...oh, gosh...

729
00:59:36,004 --> 00:59:37,255
...ages.

730
01:00:18,381 --> 01:00:19,507
Hi, there.

731
01:00:19,715 --> 01:00:22,134
Are you interested in the White House?

732
01:00:27,306 --> 01:00:29,809
I work there. I'm the press secretary.

733
01:00:29,976 --> 01:00:31,143
Jerry Ross.

734
01:00:31,894 --> 01:00:33,688
Have you ever heard of me?

735
01:00:35,314 --> 01:00:37,942
You wouldn't believe
the pressure of my job.

736
01:00:39,652 --> 01:00:41,821
It's nice to see a new face.

737
01:00:49,579 --> 01:00:50,997
Are you doing anything?

738
01:00:51,081 --> 01:00:53,166
'Cause if you want, I...

739
01:00:53,333 --> 01:00:55,377
...could give you a personalized tour.

740
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:57,004
Would you like that?

741
01:00:59,381 --> 01:01:02,467
Hey, Mitch, it's me. Can you let me in?

742
01:01:06,305 --> 01:01:08,557
Hello, Mr. Ross. Sure.

743
01:01:08,724 --> 01:01:11,226
We're a little nervous here,
after what happened.

744
01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:12,394
Exactly.

745
01:01:21,737 --> 01:01:24,656
Many great men and women
have passed through here.

746
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:27,409
Now we're passing through here.

747
01:01:27,910 --> 01:01:29,995
Feels good, don't it?

748
01:01:33,332 --> 01:01:35,167
You're very graceful.

749
01:01:35,918 --> 01:01:37,169
I like that.

750
01:01:44,843 --> 01:01:46,011
Come here.

751
01:02:06,532 --> 01:02:08,618
We call this the Kennedy Room.

752
01:02:12,956 --> 01:02:14,624
Pretty nifty, huh?

753
01:02:47,907 --> 01:02:49,158
So...

754
01:02:49,325 --> 01:02:50,910
...how about a drink?

755
01:03:21,025 --> 01:03:22,943
Getting more comfortable.

756
01:03:25,279 --> 01:03:26,697
Outstanding.

757
01:03:41,211 --> 01:03:42,796
How's my lady doing?

758
01:03:53,141 --> 01:03:55,226
Oh, missy, you're hot.

759
01:03:55,977 --> 01:03:58,396
Could we get that gum out of your mouth?

760
01:04:04,986 --> 01:04:06,321
My finger!

761
01:04:11,493 --> 01:04:14,329
Hello! Hello, operator?
This is an emergency!

762
01:04:14,496 --> 01:04:15,580
Help!

763
01:05:41,417 --> 01:05:42,585
Don't shoot!

764
01:05:47,089 --> 01:05:48,674
Don't worry, darling.

765
01:05:57,517 --> 01:05:58,602
Get down!

766
01:06:08,946 --> 01:06:10,364
Thank you, Mitch.

767
01:06:10,530 --> 01:06:11,740
It's my job.

768
01:07:06,004 --> 01:07:06,921
What's happening?

769
01:07:07,005 --> 01:07:10,425
They appear to be
in a highly agitated state.

770
01:07:10,592 --> 01:07:13,011
And I, I don't know.

771
01:07:13,678 --> 01:07:15,263
I honestly don't know.

772
01:07:15,430 --> 01:07:18,433
I don't know what's going on anymore.
This is frustrating.

773
01:07:18,516 --> 01:07:20,226
I'm not feeling myself.

774
01:07:20,602 --> 01:07:22,687
lf only I could hold you in my arms!

775
01:07:22,770 --> 01:07:24,355
Oh, Donald!

776
01:07:24,522 --> 01:07:26,149
I'm scared!

777
01:08:00,309 --> 01:08:01,393
Excuse me.

778
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:04,396
You said you wanted to know
as soon as possible.

779
01:08:04,563 --> 01:08:05,648
What is it?

780
01:08:05,731 --> 01:08:06,982
It's NO2.

781
01:08:07,149 --> 01:08:08,901
Highly concentrated.

782
01:08:09,068 --> 01:08:10,402
Nitrogen.

783
01:08:10,903 --> 01:08:12,237
So...

784
01:08:12,488 --> 01:08:15,491
...that's how it could breathe
in our atmosphere.

785
01:08:16,325 --> 01:08:18,160
What's that noise?

786
01:08:50,151 --> 01:08:53,321
But, Theodore,
I simply do not feel that Lincoln....

787
01:08:53,738 --> 01:08:55,407
It's a full-scale invasion.

788
01:08:55,490 --> 01:08:57,242
We must get you to safety.

789
01:09:03,164 --> 01:09:04,416
Not this way?

790
01:09:04,499 --> 01:09:07,002
I'm sorry, there's a tour going through.

791
01:09:07,586 --> 01:09:11,590
The Blue Room is often considered
the most beautiful in the White House.

792
01:09:11,756 --> 01:09:14,926
It is often used by the president
to receive guests.

793
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:18,763
It is furnished to represent
the period of James Monroe.

794
01:09:18,847 --> 01:09:20,056
What's that?

795
01:09:20,473 --> 01:09:21,808
That...

796
01:09:21,975 --> 01:09:24,561
...is a portrait of James Monroe.

797
01:10:16,447 --> 01:10:17,949
We lost Taffy!

798
01:10:22,536 --> 01:10:26,123
Keep moving,
we must get you to the back stairs!

799
01:10:32,630 --> 01:10:34,548
The Nancy Reagan chandelier!

800
01:10:53,527 --> 01:10:56,530
What are you gawking at?
Get that president out of here!

801
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:04,913
I personally guarantee...

802
01:11:05,330 --> 01:11:08,792
...that you will get a complete return
on your investment...

803
01:11:08,917 --> 01:11:10,919
...within five months.

804
01:11:11,086 --> 01:11:13,005
Mr. Land, excuse me.

805
01:11:13,171 --> 01:11:16,425
Just a second, Sheik Rakula.

806
01:11:18,427 --> 01:11:19,177
Now...

807
01:11:19,261 --> 01:11:23,432
...even in a time of so-called
intergalactic emergency...

808
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:25,934
...the people...

809
01:11:26,101 --> 01:11:28,770
...still want to roll them bones!

810
01:11:30,272 --> 01:11:31,773
I believe--

811
01:11:32,274 --> 01:11:34,109
Just five more minutes.

812
01:11:35,027 --> 01:11:38,030
What I'd like for you to do is to...

813
01:11:38,196 --> 01:11:41,533
...view our new,
state-of-the-art show room.

814
01:11:42,868 --> 01:11:45,203
It is out-of-sight!

815
01:11:46,788 --> 01:11:47,915
Gentlemen.

816
01:11:51,961 --> 01:11:53,963
There is no way...

817
01:11:54,130 --> 01:11:55,965
...that we can lose.

818
01:12:41,177 --> 01:12:44,514
''It's not unusual to be loved by anyone

819
01:12:46,349 --> 01:12:49,936
''It's not unusual to have fun with anyone

820
01:12:51,438 --> 01:12:55,025
''But when I see you hanging
about with anyone

821
01:12:56,902 --> 01:12:59,571
''It's not unusual to see me cry

822
01:13:01,490 --> 01:13:03,492
''I want to die''

823
01:13:04,326 --> 01:13:06,161
I've called you all day.

824
01:13:06,328 --> 01:13:07,746
The flight's been canceled.

825
01:13:07,830 --> 01:13:10,332
Byron, there's Martians everywhere!

826
01:13:11,250 --> 01:13:12,209
Hello?

827
01:13:13,836 --> 01:13:15,254
I can't hear you!

828
01:13:20,884 --> 01:13:22,636
I must get to Washington.

829
01:13:27,725 --> 01:13:29,518
Do you know anyone who can fly a plane?

830
01:13:29,602 --> 01:13:30,769
Your husband, Art.

831
01:13:30,853 --> 01:13:31,937
He's dead.

832
01:13:32,104 --> 01:13:33,647
I told him this would happen.

833
01:13:33,731 --> 01:13:35,899
I loaded the plane with supplies.

834
01:13:36,191 --> 01:13:40,529
I want to go to the Tahoe caves.
It's remote, the Martians won't find it.

835
01:13:40,946 --> 01:13:41,947
Where's the plane?

836
01:13:42,031 --> 01:13:44,783
Private airfield. Other side of the freeway.

837
01:13:44,950 --> 01:13:46,702
Will it fly to Washington?

838
01:13:46,869 --> 01:13:48,704
I want to go to Tahoe.

839
01:13:48,871 --> 01:13:50,706
''You find it happens

840
01:13:50,874 --> 01:13:53,043
''All the time

841
01:13:53,627 --> 01:13:56,046
''Love will never do

842
01:13:56,713 --> 01:13:58,715
''What you want it to

843
01:13:59,633 --> 01:14:01,635
''Why can't this crazy love

844
01:14:02,052 --> 01:14:04,054
''Be mine''

845
01:14:12,979 --> 01:14:14,314
Jesus Christ!

846
01:14:23,365 --> 01:14:24,866
Girls, get out!

847
01:14:34,125 --> 01:14:36,544
There's a Martian right behind me!

848
01:14:36,711 --> 01:14:39,381
You're Tom Jones! ''It Ain't Unusual.''

849
01:14:40,548 --> 01:14:41,633
Autograph?

850
01:14:41,716 --> 01:14:43,843
Anybody got a pen?

851
01:15:01,988 --> 01:15:03,322
Great punch.

852
01:15:03,489 --> 01:15:04,907
You'll need that gun.

853
01:15:04,991 --> 01:15:06,742
-I'm Tom Jones.
-Byron Williams.

854
01:15:06,826 --> 01:15:09,078
I saw you fight in Cardiff, Wales.

855
01:15:10,413 --> 01:15:11,581
You okay?

856
01:15:11,998 --> 01:15:14,250
-I need a drink.
-You and me both.

857
01:15:14,417 --> 01:15:16,419
-We better go.
-Can you fly a plane?

858
01:15:16,502 --> 01:15:17,420
Sure. Got one?

859
01:15:17,503 --> 01:15:18,588
She has.

860
01:15:38,107 --> 01:15:40,860
Don't run, we are your friends.

861
01:16:11,892 --> 01:16:13,477
Martians blew up the shop!

862
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:14,478
You're kidding.

863
01:16:14,561 --> 01:16:15,646
Should I get Grandma?

864
01:16:15,729 --> 01:16:19,232
Forget her! She's halfway
to outer space already! Here!

865
01:16:19,399 --> 01:16:22,569
I'll tell you one thing.
They ain't getting the TV!

866
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:29,076
The president of France is on line two.

867
01:16:32,913 --> 01:16:36,166
Mr. President, the president of France
is on line two.

868
01:16:36,333 --> 01:16:38,168
He says it's important.

869
01:16:43,757 --> 01:16:45,926
Hello, Maurice.

870
01:16:48,595 --> 01:16:50,264
I have good news.

871
01:16:50,431 --> 01:16:51,933
The Martian ambassador is here.

872
01:16:52,016 --> 01:16:54,269
We've negotiated a settlement.

873
01:16:56,271 --> 01:16:58,606
Maurice get out of the room.

874
01:16:58,773 --> 01:17:00,275
Get out, now!

875
01:17:45,903 --> 01:17:47,155
Mr. President.

876
01:17:49,575 --> 01:17:51,327
Mr. President.

877
01:17:51,493 --> 01:17:54,079
I need you to sign this!

878
01:17:58,834 --> 01:18:00,336
What is it?

879
01:18:00,502 --> 01:18:02,922
My last will and testament?

880
01:18:03,088 --> 01:18:07,092
It is an order to deploy
our nuclear capability, sir.

881
01:19:18,915 --> 01:19:20,834
What the hell was that?

882
01:21:03,146 --> 01:21:04,064
Look!

883
01:21:11,488 --> 01:21:12,739
What was that?

884
01:21:14,783 --> 01:21:15,867
Where you going?

885
01:21:15,951 --> 01:21:17,035
To get Grandma.

886
01:21:17,119 --> 01:21:19,079
Stay and defend this trailer!

887
01:21:19,162 --> 01:21:21,290
That's what Billy-Glenn would do.

888
01:21:21,456 --> 01:21:23,041
You're disgracing a hero!

889
01:21:23,125 --> 01:21:25,627
I don't care. I'm gonna go get grandma.

890
01:21:26,295 --> 01:21:27,671
Come back here!

891
01:21:40,976 --> 01:21:42,728
What in the hell is that?

892
01:21:50,194 --> 01:21:51,529
Cut it out!

893
01:21:57,035 --> 01:21:58,411
Stop it!

894
01:22:07,337 --> 01:22:08,463
-This way!
-No, this way!

895
01:22:08,546 --> 01:22:11,007
It's a short cut! The airfield's--

896
01:22:11,174 --> 01:22:13,676
Bullshit! The airfield's over there!

897
01:22:19,515 --> 01:22:23,436
Being dressed like King Tut
doesn't make you our leader!

898
01:22:23,561 --> 01:22:25,063
Look, this is wrong!

899
01:22:25,229 --> 01:22:29,067
We're lost! He led us down a maze!
I'm going back to the hotel.

900
01:22:29,233 --> 01:22:30,568
-This way!
-Wait!

901
01:22:30,735 --> 01:22:32,570
Where are you going?

902
01:22:32,737 --> 01:22:33,488
Come on.

903
01:22:33,571 --> 01:22:35,073
But, I like him.

904
01:22:41,537 --> 01:22:45,875
Assholes! Why'd I listen to them?
I should have stayed in the hotel.

905
01:22:46,459 --> 01:22:47,877
Shit!

906
01:22:50,589 --> 01:22:52,091
I surrender, okay?

907
01:22:52,591 --> 01:22:54,885
You understand what that means?

908
01:22:56,095 --> 01:22:58,764
Look! You're intelligent beings.

909
01:22:59,390 --> 01:23:01,600
Let's cut a deal. I can help.

910
01:23:01,767 --> 01:23:03,227
I'm a lawyer!

911
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:06,981
You want to conquer the world,
you'll need lawyers, right?

912
01:23:08,607 --> 01:23:09,608
Here.

913
01:23:10,484 --> 01:23:12,111
You want my watch?

914
01:23:12,611 --> 01:23:15,281
Take it. Take it. It's a Rolex!

915
01:23:25,791 --> 01:23:27,251
Nice shot!

916
01:23:27,418 --> 01:23:28,836
Pity I was too late.

917
01:23:28,919 --> 01:23:30,796
Can I have the gun back?

918
01:23:31,005 --> 01:23:32,923
Give me the gun and come on!

919
01:24:47,707 --> 01:24:48,708
Grandma!

920
01:24:57,093 --> 01:24:58,386
Oh, my God!

921
01:25:12,525 --> 01:25:14,902
I think these guys are very sick.

922
01:25:15,736 --> 01:25:18,447
What's happening to them?
What's killing them?

923
01:25:19,907 --> 01:25:22,285
I think it must be my music.

924
01:25:30,084 --> 01:25:31,502
Quiet!

925
01:26:23,138 --> 01:26:25,724
You think you can do anything you want.

926
01:26:25,891 --> 01:26:27,309
You can't.

927
01:26:27,476 --> 01:26:28,310
Because...

928
01:26:28,393 --> 01:26:30,646
...we are human...

929
01:26:30,979 --> 01:26:31,980
...beings.

930
01:26:32,064 --> 01:26:35,651
And we have the United States Army...

931
01:26:36,652 --> 01:26:38,236
...that'll fight you...

932
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:42,407
...to the last man!
And we'll never surrender!

933
01:26:46,244 --> 01:26:47,829
Do you hear me?

934
01:26:47,997 --> 01:26:50,917
We'll fight you on the beaches.
We'll fight you in the streets.

935
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,503
We will never, never surrender!

936
01:26:53,670 --> 01:26:56,005
We will win!

937
01:26:56,172 --> 01:26:58,007
Democracy will survive!

938
01:26:58,258 --> 01:27:00,093
We will never, ever...

939
01:27:00,260 --> 01:27:01,844
...surrender!

940
01:27:02,011 --> 01:27:03,346
We will win!

941
01:27:03,513 --> 01:27:05,515
The eagle will be triumphant!

942
01:27:35,545 --> 01:27:37,046
Why...

943
01:27:37,297 --> 01:27:39,048
...are you doing this?

944
01:27:41,134 --> 01:27:42,302
Why?

945
01:27:43,469 --> 01:27:46,222
lsn't the universe big enough...

946
01:27:46,806 --> 01:27:48,474
...for both of us?

947
01:27:52,396 --> 01:27:54,481
What is wrong with you people?

948
01:27:57,401 --> 01:27:59,069
We could work together.

949
01:28:00,237 --> 01:28:02,323
Why be enemies?

950
01:28:03,324 --> 01:28:05,075
Because we're different?

951
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:07,828
Is that why?

952
01:28:11,999 --> 01:28:14,668
Think of the things that we could do.

953
01:28:16,086 --> 01:28:19,006
Think how strong we would be!

954
01:28:20,841 --> 01:28:22,343
Earth...

955
01:28:23,177 --> 01:28:25,095
...and Mars...

956
01:28:26,180 --> 01:28:27,431
...together.

957
01:28:30,059 --> 01:28:32,895
There is nothing
that we could not accomplish.

958
01:28:33,938 --> 01:28:35,689
Think about it!

959
01:28:37,942 --> 01:28:39,860
Think about it!

960
01:28:41,362 --> 01:28:43,030
Why destroy...

961
01:28:43,864 --> 01:28:46,033
...when you can create?

962
01:28:47,368 --> 01:28:49,370
We can have it all...

963
01:28:50,205 --> 01:28:52,624
...or we can smash it all!

964
01:28:56,127 --> 01:28:57,629
Why can't we...

965
01:28:57,879 --> 01:29:00,131
...work out our differences?

966
01:29:01,383 --> 01:29:03,301
Why can't we...

967
01:29:03,635 --> 01:29:05,804
...work things out?

968
01:29:08,306 --> 01:29:10,475
Little people...

969
01:29:12,811 --> 01:29:14,896
...why can't we all just...

970
01:29:16,147 --> 01:29:17,899
...get along?

971
01:29:44,759 --> 01:29:45,969
What's this?

972
01:30:24,216 --> 01:30:26,802
Don't run. We are your friends.

973
01:30:28,387 --> 01:30:30,973
Don't run. We are your friends.

974
01:30:44,445 --> 01:30:46,280
Next stop, radio station.

975
01:30:49,201 --> 01:30:50,702
There it is!

976
01:30:51,370 --> 01:30:52,955
Let's move it!

977
01:31:10,889 --> 01:31:12,224
There it is.

978
01:31:13,558 --> 01:31:15,644
Go start it. Go with him.

979
01:31:15,811 --> 01:31:17,396
Cindy, come with me.

980
01:31:34,663 --> 01:31:36,248
Are you sure you can fly this?

981
01:31:36,331 --> 01:31:38,000
I think so, yeah.

982
01:31:40,419 --> 01:31:41,837
Who put that on?

983
01:31:43,171 --> 01:31:45,924
-It's stuck!
-Cindy, over here.

984
01:31:52,432 --> 01:31:53,600
Shit!

985
01:31:54,517 --> 01:31:56,853
They haven't seen us yet. Come here.

986
01:31:58,938 --> 01:32:00,356
Get in the plane.

987
01:32:00,773 --> 01:32:02,609
I'll distract them.

988
01:32:02,775 --> 01:32:05,028
The first chance you get, go.

989
01:32:05,194 --> 01:32:07,363
-I'm not leaving you!
-Just do it!

990
01:32:07,447 --> 01:32:09,449
I'll draw them away! Go!

991
01:32:09,616 --> 01:32:10,700
No!

992
01:32:10,867 --> 01:32:12,285
I said go!

993
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:18,625
Oh, my God!

994
01:32:19,459 --> 01:32:20,793
What's he doing?

995
01:32:20,877 --> 01:32:21,794
He's flipped!

996
01:32:21,878 --> 01:32:23,796
He's going to throw them off
so we can escape.

997
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:25,381
We can't leave him!

998
01:32:28,551 --> 01:32:29,636
No weapon!

999
01:32:29,969 --> 01:32:32,138
No clown outfit!

1000
01:32:32,305 --> 01:32:33,556
Just me!

1001
01:32:34,140 --> 01:32:35,558
Byron Williams...

1002
01:32:36,225 --> 01:32:38,478
...heavyweight champion...

1003
01:32:39,062 --> 01:32:40,730
...of the world!

1004
01:33:51,428 --> 01:33:53,513
Something's happened.

1005
01:33:53,805 --> 01:33:55,890
Something's happened to Byron.

1006
01:34:12,282 --> 01:34:14,868
''When I'm calling you

1007
01:34:36,473 --> 01:34:40,018
''That means I offer my love to you''

1008
01:35:17,431 --> 01:35:18,849
Good-bye, my darling.

1009
01:35:18,933 --> 01:35:20,893
I wish things were different.

1010
01:35:21,686 --> 01:35:23,354
So do I.

1011
01:35:28,943 --> 01:35:30,278
Good-bye.

1012
01:35:30,695 --> 01:35:31,779
I love you.

1013
01:35:31,862 --> 01:35:33,781
I love you too, Nathalie.

1014
01:37:09,545 --> 01:37:11,130
Florence Norris...

1015
01:37:11,297 --> 01:37:14,467
...I present to you
the Congressional Medal of Honor...

1016
01:37:14,634 --> 01:37:16,886
...the nation's highest decoration.

1017
01:37:18,805 --> 01:37:22,392
Thank you,
but don't you dare let this happen again!

1018
01:37:23,893 --> 01:37:25,645
Richard Norris...

1019
01:37:25,812 --> 01:37:28,815
...on behalf of my parents,
who couldn't be here today...

1020
01:37:28,898 --> 01:37:31,401
...for saving the world from the Martians...

1021
01:37:31,484 --> 01:37:33,987
...I present to you the Medal of Honor.

1022
01:37:34,821 --> 01:37:36,906
Don't kiss me if you don't want.

1023
01:37:37,323 --> 01:37:38,825
I have to.

1024
01:37:41,995 --> 01:37:44,330
I prepared a speech. Is that okay?

1025
01:37:45,081 --> 01:37:47,166
Sure, that's very appropriate.

1026
01:37:52,006 --> 01:37:53,257
Hi, everybody.

1027
01:37:54,675 --> 01:37:55,926
I want to say--

1028
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:58,596
Can you speak up? We can't hear you.

1029
01:37:59,096 --> 01:38:02,433
I want to say that there's
a lot of people in the world...

1030
01:38:02,516 --> 01:38:05,436
...that have done a lot more
than I have, and...

1031
01:38:05,603 --> 01:38:07,771
...they should be here now...

1032
01:38:08,022 --> 01:38:09,523
...getting a medal.

1033
01:38:11,525 --> 01:38:13,694
And I want to thank my grandma...

1034
01:38:13,861 --> 01:38:16,030
...for always being good to me...

1035
01:38:16,196 --> 01:38:19,116
...and for helping save the world
and everything.

1036
01:38:20,284 --> 01:38:23,537
So, I guess, like, now we just have to...

1037
01:38:23,704 --> 01:38:27,708
...start over and start rebuilding
everything, like our houses.

1038
01:38:27,875 --> 01:38:32,796
But I was thinking, maybe instead
of houses we could live in tepees.

1039
01:38:33,130 --> 01:38:35,299
Because it's better in many ways.

1040
01:38:38,886 --> 01:38:41,555
That's all I have to say. Thanks.

1041
01:38:43,474 --> 01:38:44,725
Was that okay?

1042
01:38:44,808 --> 01:38:45,893
Yeah.

1043
01:38:46,728 --> 01:38:48,438
Do you got a girlfriend?

1044
01:38:48,647 --> 01:38:49,648
No.

1045
01:38:51,066 --> 01:38:54,152
Give me a break.
Go on in there and clean your room.

1046
01:38:54,319 --> 01:38:56,988
I can't do this all by myself. Look at you.

1047
01:40:16,110 --> 01:40:18,195
