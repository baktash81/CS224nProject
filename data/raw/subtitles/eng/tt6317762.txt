00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:41,693
[exhales] This is Alex
McAllister to Mission Control.

5
00:00:41,867 --> 00:00:43,826
It is 0900 hours on Mars,

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,090
and the temperature's
a balmy negative 40 degrees.

7
00:00:47,264 --> 00:00:49,223
Wind speed, mild 5 knots,

8
00:00:49,397 --> 00:00:53,488
and the radiation reading is
on track for an annual 200 mSv.

9
00:00:53,662 --> 00:00:55,925
Final numbers should be
coming in through shortly,

10
00:00:56,099 --> 00:00:59,407
but all in all, it is a good day
to be on Mars.

11
00:01:00,364 --> 00:01:01,539
Over and out.

12
00:01:01,713 --> 00:01:02,845

00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:08,459
[Alex]
This is Mars.

16
00:01:08,633 --> 00:01:11,723
This will be the first colony
on Mars.

17
00:01:11,897 --> 00:01:14,683
When we were young, my brother
and I would stare at the stars

18
00:01:14,857 --> 00:01:17,903
and dream of the day
we became astronauts.

19
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:20,210
And now that day is here.

20
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:23,953
I'm going to Mars to write
mankind's next chapter.

21
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,652
I will travel there in this.

22
00:01:28,958 --> 00:01:30,960
And then this will be my home.

23
00:01:31,134 --> 00:01:34,181
This is where
I'll work, explore,

24
00:01:34,355 --> 00:01:35,747
marry,

25
00:01:36,574 --> 00:01:37,967
pioneer,

26
00:01:38,576 --> 00:01:39,969
and die.

27
00:01:42,537 --> 00:01:44,278
Mars is where I'll die.

28
00:01:45,366 --> 00:01:46,628

[phone keys clacking]

38
00:03:18,894 --> 00:03:21,462
Honey, it's not gonna hurt you
if you look away for two minutes.

39
00:03:21,636 --> 00:03:23,725
It won't. People will.

40
00:03:23,899 --> 00:03:26,684
- Oh, come on. I don't get to see
you that often. -[Lizzie] Mom,

41
00:03:26,858 --> 00:03:29,687
- I've been busy.
- [Jeff] Oh, you're here already.

42
00:03:31,036 --> 00:03:32,603
- Hi, Lizzie.
- Hi, Dad.

43
00:03:32,777 --> 00:03:35,084
Ugh. Wash your hands first, Dad.

44
00:03:35,258 --> 00:03:36,477
Get any sleep?

45
00:03:38,696 --> 00:03:41,438
Walls are low. I'm gonna have
to start trucking in water soon.

46
00:03:41,612 --> 00:03:43,135
Or it's time to sell.

47
00:03:43,962 --> 00:03:46,226
What? You said yourself.
A drought is coming.

48
00:03:46,965 --> 00:03:48,552
-[Liz] You need to get out of here.
- Nope.

49
00:03:48,576 --> 00:03:50,534
I need someone to take over.

50
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,754
- Hey, can you flip that one?
- Mm-hmm.

51
00:03:52,928 --> 00:03:55,017
Clouds cleared. Hey.

52
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,715
Were you outside?

53
00:03:58,586 --> 00:03:59,891
Hey, thanks for coming.

54
00:04:01,153 --> 00:04:04,896
Uh, yeah, anything I can do to
fulfill your unreasonable demands.

55
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,333
It was a request.

56
00:04:06,507 --> 00:04:08,900
- Mom made it a demand.
- I did not.

57
00:04:09,074 --> 00:04:12,121
Well, I'm grateful you made the
impossible journey from the city.

58
00:04:12,295 --> 00:04:14,297
- Alexander.
- That's fine, Mom. I didn't hear him.

59
00:04:14,471 --> 00:04:16,995
- You need me to text it to you?
- Would that mean I can leave?

60
00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:20,738
- Elizabeth.
- Uh, Mom, stop coddling him.

61
00:04:20,912 --> 00:04:22,697
- [Jane] I don't coddle him.
- Can I start?

62
00:04:22,871 --> 00:04:24,655
Oh, yes.
Sorry, sorry. Elizabeth.

63
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:26,353
- Okay.
- Shh, shh. Come on, settle.

64
00:04:27,092 --> 00:04:28,877
Okay, here we go.

65
00:04:29,921 --> 00:04:30,921
[clears throat]

66
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,535
So, I asked you all here
for a reason.

67
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:36,319
- Mm-hmm.
- You need a lift?

68
00:04:36,841 --> 00:04:38,669
- Oh, Mom.
- Sorry.

69
00:04:38,843 --> 00:04:41,193
I will not be returning
to engineering.

70
00:04:43,021 --> 00:04:44,821
Oh, God, just don't tell me
it's a food truck.

71
00:04:45,197 --> 00:04:46,895
I got through to the next round.

72
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:50,333
- [gasps] Oh.
- Next round of what?

73
00:04:50,507 --> 00:04:52,074
The Mission Mars Space Program.

74
00:04:52,248 --> 00:04:54,119
Um, what the hell is that?

75
00:04:55,556 --> 00:04:57,471
I'm going to Mars.

76
00:04:58,776 --> 00:04:59,776
Mars?

77
00:05:01,605 --> 00:05:02,606
The planet?

78
00:05:03,564 --> 00:05:06,044
Yep, and it's a one-way journey,

79
00:05:06,218 --> 00:05:10,222
so I wanted to tell you all
as soon as I knew for sure.

80
00:05:10,397 --> 00:05:11,876
I'm sorry. Are we joking?

81
00:05:13,443 --> 00:05:16,011
No, I'm, I'm going to Mars.

82
00:05:16,794 --> 00:05:18,709
- Like with NASA?
- [chuckles] No.

83
00:05:18,883 --> 00:05:20,450
NASA's still, like,
20 years out.

84
00:05:20,624 --> 00:05:21,744
We're gonna be going in ten.

85
00:05:22,234 --> 00:05:23,932
I'm gonna start training soon,

86
00:05:24,106 --> 00:05:25,586
um, in isolation.

87
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,284
So, I wanted to make sure
that we all spend

88
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:30,765
some time together
before that happens.

89
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:32,482
- You really believe this?
- [Lisa] Knock, knock.

90
00:05:32,506 --> 00:05:34,551
- The film crew.
- The what?

91
00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:36,205
They wanna interview me
for the news.

92
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:38,096
They, they actually wanna
talk to you guys too.

93
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,252
- What... other people know about this?
-[Alex] Hi.

94
00:05:40,427 --> 00:05:42,342
- Uh, come in. Uh, I'm Alex.
- Mm.

95
00:05:42,516 --> 00:05:46,998
Lisa Kessler, NBC Local News 5.
Where can we set up?

96
00:05:47,172 --> 00:05:48,628
- Uh, just over there in the backyard.
- Um,

97
00:05:48,652 --> 00:05:50,350
- hi. Lisa Kessler.
- [Jane] Hello.

98
00:05:50,524 --> 00:05:52,874
- Hi.
- This is so cute. Okay, great.

99
00:05:53,048 --> 00:05:54,789
This is really charming.

100
00:05:54,963 --> 00:05:56,965
[whispers]
It's them? Oh. [chuckles]

101
00:05:57,139 --> 00:05:59,663
[Lisa]
Um, uh...

102
00:05:59,837 --> 00:06:01,598
Oh, I think I could get
an Instagram shot here.

103
00:06:01,622 --> 00:06:03,754
You let this happen. Dad?

104
00:06:03,928 --> 00:06:05,190
He's an adult, Liz.

105
00:06:05,843 --> 00:06:06,888
He's lost it.

106
00:06:08,324 --> 00:06:09,823
- [sighs]
- [Jane] Liz, after the accident,

107
00:06:09,847 --> 00:06:12,589
he spent months
just lying in his room,

108
00:06:12,763 --> 00:06:15,026
and now he gets up early.
[chuckles]

109
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,854
He goes outside.

110
00:06:17,028 --> 00:06:19,204
- So does it really matter why.
- Of course it matters.

111
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,772
Well, how do you know
this isn't real?

112
00:06:21,946 --> 00:06:24,122
This is a private company.
They have means.

113
00:06:24,296 --> 00:06:25,733
Means to get to Mars?

114
00:06:25,907 --> 00:06:27,735
Do you have any idea
what that would cost?

115
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:30,781
- What kind of technology they would need?
- Well, no, but he does.

116
00:06:30,955 --> 00:06:33,001
And he's excited,
and he's happy.

117
00:06:33,175 --> 00:06:35,220
- Dad.
- I'm gonna get back to work.

118
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:39,311
- You need to let Alex do this.
- Why?

119
00:06:39,486 --> 00:06:42,402
Because whatever gets him out of
bed in the morning, we will support.

120
00:06:43,446 --> 00:06:44,839
We will all support him.

121
00:06:45,013 --> 00:06:47,232
Mom, what will people
think of us?

122
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,498
Well, your father asked him
not to name the farm.

123
00:06:51,672 --> 00:06:53,432
Mom, I think
it's a little bit late for that.

124
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,066
Well, then why don't you
help him?

125
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,243
Hey, they want a photo of me
as a kid.

126
00:06:59,027 --> 00:07:00,768
I was supposed to be
on vacation.

127
00:07:01,595 --> 00:07:04,685
- You think one of these will work?
- No, not that.

128
00:07:04,859 --> 00:07:08,297
Look, you will refer
any interview requests to me.

129
00:07:08,471 --> 00:07:12,083
You will not say, you will not think
a word without my approval, okay?

130
00:07:12,257 --> 00:07:15,260
- I don't need a PR person.
- Alex, let her.

131
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,828
- All right, Alex.
- Hi, Liz. Bailey & Co PR.

132
00:07:18,002 --> 00:07:20,701
- Let's go over the questions.
- Oh, okay. Great.

133
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:24,313
[calm instrumental music]

134

[Alex panting]

135
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:38,501
- [man 1] Okay, three, five.
- [man 2] Get two.

136
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:40,075
- [man 3] Morning, Alex.
- Hey, guys.

137
00:07:40,155 --> 00:07:40,895
Nice day.

138
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:42,462
Freeze!

139
00:07:42,636 --> 00:07:44,986
Put your weapons down
and your hands up.

140
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:47,902
She said weapons down
and hands up!

141
00:07:48,076 --> 00:07:50,774
[indistinct chatter]

142
00:07:50,948 --> 00:07:54,082
- I'm a civilian.
- State your name.

143
00:07:54,256 --> 00:07:55,823
Alexander McAllister.

144
00:07:55,997 --> 00:07:59,087
- Your purpose?
- Supply pick up.

145
00:07:59,261 --> 00:08:00,697
- Denied.
- [gun pops]

146
00:08:00,871 --> 00:08:02,307
- Stop, Blake.
- What the...

147
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,222
[Blake]
Shh, shh, guys, be quiet.

148
00:08:06,181 --> 00:08:09,706
Are these marshmallows?
You're throwing marshmallows?

149
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,969
No, no, I'm...

150
00:08:12,143 --> 00:08:14,103
-[man] All right, let's see what you got now.
- Ah.

151
00:08:16,017 --> 00:08:18,106
There are mini marshmallows,
technically.

152
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,720
- Oh, my God. Okay, so that makes it totally normal then.
- No.

153
00:08:20,804 --> 00:08:22,284
It, um...
That's not what I'm saying.

154
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,895
Just that...

155
00:08:25,853 --> 00:08:27,942
- Um...
- [men chuckle]

156
00:08:28,116 --> 00:08:29,116
[sighs]

157
00:08:31,293 --> 00:08:32,337
Mini.

158
00:08:33,643 --> 00:08:37,342
- Oh, swinging a miss.
- [men chuckle]

159
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,519
Slow news day, guys?

160
00:08:40,171 --> 00:08:41,346
[gentle instrumental music]

161
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,000
You still have one...

162
00:08:44,349 --> 00:08:45,525
in your...

163
00:08:46,656 --> 00:08:48,484
Missed one. Ah.

164
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,225
Ah.

165
00:08:52,314 --> 00:08:53,576
- [clears throat]
- Thank you.

166
00:08:54,272 --> 00:08:56,971
You, you know
there's kids up there, right?

167
00:08:57,145 --> 00:08:58,538
- I'm...
- Really?

168
00:08:59,103 --> 00:09:02,585
'Cause all I see are
highly-trained military operatives.

169
00:09:06,415 --> 00:09:08,460
[chuckles] Smooth.

170
00:09:09,461 --> 00:09:10,724
Thanks, Blake.

171
00:09:10,898 --> 00:09:13,204
That's Commander Leehe
to you, son.

172
00:09:13,378 --> 00:09:14,378
[sighs]

173
00:09:15,032 --> 00:09:16,032
Okay.

174
00:09:18,862 --> 00:09:21,604
- What am I supposed to say? I don't...
-[men chuckling]

175
00:09:28,524 --> 00:09:30,613
What family
is dahlia pinnata from?

176
00:09:30,787 --> 00:09:32,441
- Asteraceae.
- Hm.

177
00:09:32,615 --> 00:09:34,051
Yeah.

178
00:09:34,225 --> 00:09:37,402
And what weeds
are in that same family? Alex?

179
00:09:38,012 --> 00:09:39,579
I'm not doing this, Dad.

180
00:09:39,753 --> 00:09:42,190
[melancholic instrumental music]

181
00:09:49,414 --> 00:09:50,546
[video call ringing]

182
00:09:56,117 --> 00:09:57,988
- [sighs]
- Hey, What's up, Cosmonaut?

183
00:09:58,162 --> 00:10:00,600
- Hey, man, did you get in?
- You know it.

184
00:10:00,774 --> 00:10:03,385
- We're on our way, bro.
- Oh, I wish it were tomorrow.

185
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:05,692
Ugh! We'd be the first in line.

186
00:10:05,866 --> 00:10:07,781
Oh, hey, did you see
the press conference?

187
00:10:07,955 --> 00:10:09,976
They say we'll even be able to
watch the Super Bowl up there.

188
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,002
I don't even watch
the Super Bowl now. [scoffs]

189
00:10:12,176 --> 00:10:15,179
Well, you will when we're
on Mars, brother. Trust me.

190
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:17,660
- Packs Nation.
- [chuckles]

191
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:20,054
Hey, any news
on training sites yet?

192
00:10:20,228 --> 00:10:22,230
Nah. I'm still betting
on Antarctica though.

193
00:10:22,404 --> 00:10:23,686
It's the closest
to the real thing.

194
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:24,710
[exhales]

195
00:10:24,754 --> 00:10:26,016
God, I can't wait.

196
00:10:26,887 --> 00:10:29,280
- All right. Over.
- See you, man.

197
00:10:31,892 --> 00:10:33,807
[calm music]

198
00:10:33,981 --> 00:10:35,069
[exhales]

199
00:10:37,898 --> 00:10:38,898
There you go.

200
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:41,858
There's three more.

201
00:10:42,554 --> 00:10:44,034
[sighs] Dimitri?

202
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:46,428
Can you help me with this?

203
00:10:47,081 --> 00:10:49,300
Finally, my time to shine.

204
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:54,044
Okay, so I need you
to hold this on here.

205
00:10:54,218 --> 00:10:57,134
- Yep.
- I'm gonna fix these.

206
00:10:58,353 --> 00:10:59,397
What does he do?

207
00:10:59,571 --> 00:11:01,878
Um, ideally, it will

208
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,576
germinate seeds
using Martian soil.

209
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:06,491
But Martian soil is useless now.

210
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,102
That's what
I'm trying to find out.

211
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,993
The winters in Russia
are the same.

212
00:11:10,017 --> 00:11:12,497
It is impossible to grow plants.

213
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,587
But somehow life finds a way.

214
00:11:15,762 --> 00:11:17,372
That is from Jurassic Park.

215
00:11:17,938 --> 00:11:20,070
It's an old Russian pro... No.

216
00:11:20,244 --> 00:11:21,768
Wait, it is from Jurassic Park.

217
00:11:21,942 --> 00:11:23,291
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

218
00:11:23,465 --> 00:11:25,119
[flips switch]

219
00:11:25,293 --> 00:11:28,513
[device whirring]

220
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,167
- [device hisses]
- [coughs]

221
00:11:30,341 --> 00:11:32,779
Oh, oh. Oh, boy.

222
00:11:32,953 --> 00:11:36,217
Does not work at all,
and it's burning my face.

223
00:11:36,391 --> 00:11:38,523
Good practice for space, no?
[coughs]

224
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,545
This is what it would be like
when you disintegrate

225
00:11:40,569 --> 00:11:42,266
because you accidentally
open a window.

226
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,790
[coughs]

227
00:11:43,964 --> 00:11:46,531
- Still need you, Dimitri.
- [coughs]

228
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,447
- I...
- All right.

229
00:11:51,754 --> 00:11:53,669
-[Steve on TV] Now to Space News.
- Oh.

230
00:11:53,843 --> 00:11:55,821
-[Steve] Boy, you don't hear that enough.
-[Lisa chuckles]

231
00:11:55,845 --> 00:11:57,823
Well, privately funded company
Mission Mars has announced

232
00:11:57,847 --> 00:12:01,198
its final candidates in a race
to colonize the planet.

233
00:12:01,372 --> 00:12:03,766
That's right, Steve.
The incredibly ambitious,

234
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,334
perhaps impossible goal
of the program

235
00:12:06,508 --> 00:12:09,641
is to get humans
on Mars by 2028...

236
00:12:10,686 --> 00:12:14,559
decades ahead of NASA,
SpaceX, and Virgin Galactic.

237
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:19,521
Mission Mars believes they can
by making it a one-way journey,

238
00:12:19,695 --> 00:12:23,568
thereby cutting in half the
supplies needed for a round trip.

239
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,484
- Hmm, you're saying there's no return?
- Yes.

240
00:12:26,658 --> 00:12:29,836
[Lisa] Colonists will bid
farewell to their friends,

241
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:32,795
family and lives here
to participate.

242
00:12:32,969 --> 00:12:34,884
- You'd hope you'd like your coworkers.
-[laughs]

243
00:12:35,058 --> 00:12:36,712
[Lisa]
Oh, fingers crossed.

244
00:12:38,235 --> 00:12:42,457
Who would volunteer to move
to a place so uninhabitable,

245
00:12:42,631 --> 00:12:46,374
its atmosphere and temperatures
would kill you in an instant?

246
00:12:46,548 --> 00:12:49,420
Alex McAllister,
who I spoke to earlier.

247
00:12:49,594 --> 00:12:52,815
Alex, do you really plan
to leave Earth forever?

248
00:12:52,989 --> 00:12:56,297
[Alex on TV] Without a second thought.
Lisa, I'm very excited.

249
00:12:56,471 --> 00:12:58,690
[Lisa] But can you even
grasp what you're giving up?

250
00:12:58,865 --> 00:13:02,172
You're relinquishing
your whole life to this program.

251
00:13:02,346 --> 00:13:05,828
Well, I think some people
may see it as giving up a life,

252
00:13:06,002 --> 00:13:09,179
whereas I see it
as choosing a new one.

253
00:13:09,353 --> 00:13:11,442
-[Lisa] Hm.
- Great. He seems like he's in a cult.

254
00:13:11,616 --> 00:13:12,617
No, he...

255
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,184
If you have kids up there,

256
00:13:14,924 --> 00:13:16,273
are they Martians?

257
00:13:17,274 --> 00:13:20,451
You know, I su...
I suppose they would be.

258
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,845
- [Lisa laughs]
- [Alex laughs, whistles]

259
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:25,326
-[Lisa] Whoo. It takes all kinds.
-[Alex] It does.

260
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,502
[indistinct chatter]

261
00:13:29,069 --> 00:13:30,505
Saw you on the news last night.

262
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:32,899
- Yeah, it's pretty good, right?
- [Blake] Attack!

263
00:13:33,073 --> 00:13:34,944
- [gun popping]
- [groans]

264
00:13:35,118 --> 00:13:37,642
- [sighs]
- Keep moving, citizen.

265
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,645
[men laughing]

266
00:13:42,734 --> 00:13:44,954
[calm instrumental music]

267
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:50,786
-[phone ringing] -[mutters indistinctly] .
..come team to mission control.

268
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:56,400
- Mr. McAllister? [gasps]
- Oh.

269
00:14:01,014 --> 00:14:02,972
So, this is how
you greet people?

270
00:14:04,669 --> 00:14:07,237
Only when I'm trying
to make a good impression.

271
00:14:07,803 --> 00:14:11,328
Okay, well, I'm Daisy, and I'm
going to be handling your insurance.

272
00:14:11,502 --> 00:14:13,722
Oh, okay. Where's Mike?

273
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:16,551
He asked me to sit down
with you. I hope that's okay.

274
00:14:16,725 --> 00:14:19,206
Ye... Yeah, yeah. A... Absolutely.

275
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,904
- Screw Mike. [chuckles]
- He's my uncle.

276
00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:26,604
- He never mentioned you.
- Must be deeply ashamed of me.

277
00:14:26,778 --> 00:14:28,215
[phone ringing
in the background]

278
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:30,870
What can I do for you,
Mr. McAllister?

279
00:14:31,479 --> 00:14:33,785
- Oh, Alex.
- Alex.

280
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,527
Uh, I need
a life insurance policy.

281
00:14:36,701 --> 00:14:38,486
Okay. What's the purpose?

282
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:41,793
- I'm going to Mars.
- [chuckles] Okay.

283
00:14:41,968 --> 00:14:45,667
So, we'll just need our
interplanetary template then.

284
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:47,234
Great.

285
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,018
[chuckles]

286
00:14:51,499 --> 00:14:53,370
- Mars?
- Yes.

287
00:14:54,328 --> 00:14:57,200
- How?
- The Mission Mars Space Program.

288
00:15:00,203 --> 00:15:03,163
Okay. Wow. All right.

289
00:15:04,555 --> 00:15:05,600
Mars.

290
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,210
Mars.

291
00:15:09,343 --> 00:15:11,519
I ironically don't have
a template for that,

292
00:15:11,693 --> 00:15:15,044
but we could just start
with our standard form.

293
00:15:16,828 --> 00:15:17,873
Um, okay.

294
00:15:24,532 --> 00:15:25,620
Why are you going?

295
00:15:26,838 --> 00:15:28,536
You know,
no one ever asks me that.

296
00:15:29,102 --> 00:15:30,102
I am.

297
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:33,933
Uh, because it's Mars.

298
00:15:35,717 --> 00:15:38,938
- And?
- Oh, and, and we know next to nothing about the universe,

299
00:15:39,112 --> 00:15:41,481
and we're not gonna figure it out
from here. We have to explore.

300
00:15:41,505 --> 00:15:43,855
You know, if we get to Mars,
maybe we'll find some answers.

301
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:45,683
[gentle music]

302
00:15:45,857 --> 00:15:46,684
[inhales]

303
00:15:46,858 --> 00:15:48,730
I know it sounds crazy...

304
00:15:49,905 --> 00:15:53,778
but walking on the moon also
seemed impossible until it happened.

305
00:15:54,823 --> 00:15:58,870
Everything that we know,
everything that makes us great

306
00:15:59,045 --> 00:16:02,396
was once an insane idea.

307
00:16:04,746 --> 00:16:06,922
It doesn't sound insane
when you say it like that.

308
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:12,275
And plus, we're not gonna be
able to live here much longer.

309
00:16:12,449 --> 00:16:13,992
Gonna have to start
looking at other options.

310
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:15,856
I mean, we've completely
destroyed this planet.

311
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:17,846
And back to grim reality.

312
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,895
Did you just move here?

313
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:26,942
It's a small town.

314
00:16:27,638 --> 00:16:28,770
Yeah, I did.

315
00:16:30,337 --> 00:16:32,513
- Why?
- [clicks tongue]

316
00:16:32,687 --> 00:16:36,386
Sometimes you wake up with this burning
desire to be an insurance salesman,

317
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,998
and you'll do anything
to make that dream a reality.

318
00:16:46,527 --> 00:16:47,745
I wanted to be a swimmer.

319
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,270
What happened?

320
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:54,578
[smacks lips]
A lot of other people did too.

321
00:16:55,449 --> 00:16:57,016
Hmm. I'm a terrible swimmer.

322
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,887
Then at least I'll beat you.

323
00:16:59,453 --> 00:17:00,453
[chuckles]

324
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,371
[door creaks]

325
00:17:07,287 --> 00:17:10,507
I, uh, I may have some follow-up
questions if that's okay.

326
00:17:10,681 --> 00:17:12,161
Um, y... yeah.

327
00:17:12,335 --> 00:17:13,858
Got any plans tonight?

328
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,252
I'm studying the composition
of Martian dirt.

329
00:17:16,861 --> 00:17:17,949
Me too.

330
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:22,606
- I'm just kidding. I'm just watching TV.
[chuckles] -[mutters]

331
00:17:26,001 --> 00:17:28,134
Well, h... have a swell night.

332
00:17:33,356 --> 00:17:34,986
- Hey, how did it go?
- [Blake] Here he comes.

333
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,011
- [gun popping]
- [Alex] Ah!

334
00:17:36,185 --> 00:17:37,273
[Daisy]
Is he for real?

335
00:17:37,447 --> 00:17:39,754
He's always been a little odd.

336
00:17:39,928 --> 00:17:42,757
Listen, we can't insure him
if this is nonsense,

337
00:17:42,931 --> 00:17:45,542
but his family's been a part of
the community for generations,

338
00:17:45,716 --> 00:17:48,545
and, frankly, they've had
a rough time recently.

339
00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:50,808
We owe it to them
to look into it.

340
00:17:50,982 --> 00:17:53,004
I know it's not part of your job
description, but do you think...

341
00:17:53,028 --> 00:17:54,943
- No, I'll do it.
- Yeah?

342
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:58,425
- Yeah.
- All right. Good night.

343
00:17:58,990 --> 00:17:59,990
Night.

344
00:18:00,122 --> 00:18:02,690
[gentle instrumental music]

345
00:18:15,877 --> 00:18:16,921
[sighs]

346
00:18:36,202 --> 00:18:38,595
[low tractor whirring]

347
00:18:41,294 --> 00:18:44,123
[bright instrumental music]

348
00:18:45,385 --> 00:18:48,127
[bird tweeting]

349
00:18:48,301 --> 00:18:50,564
[Dimitri] She's saying
when you say her name,

350
00:18:50,738 --> 00:18:53,871
she will run through
the flames to you.

351
00:18:54,045 --> 00:18:56,526
Peace will prevail.

352
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,528
There will be peace
because you said her name?

353
00:18:58,702 --> 00:19:00,095
And fire. [speaks in Russian]

354
00:19:00,269 --> 00:19:01,792
Peace and fire.

355
00:19:01,966 --> 00:19:04,186
[indistinct conversation]

356
00:19:05,013 --> 00:19:06,232
[whispers] It's the girl.

357
00:19:07,537 --> 00:19:10,149
- Wow, this is beautiful.
- [chuckles]

358
00:19:12,412 --> 00:19:13,500
- Hi.
- Hi.

359
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,415
- [chuckles]
- Hello.

360
00:19:18,113 --> 00:19:19,288
[Alex]
Hi.

361
00:19:22,857 --> 00:19:24,356
- Oh, I think I hear your father...
- Yes.

362
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,381
Mother, I...

363
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:32,301
- So you live in a flower farm?
- Yeah, flowers everywhere.

364
00:19:33,302 --> 00:19:36,131
- Any daisies?
- No, daisies are weeds.

365
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,176
Thank you.

366
00:19:38,655 --> 00:19:41,963
Well, uh, sorry to just show up.

367
00:19:42,137 --> 00:19:43,704
I just had
a couple more questions,

368
00:19:43,878 --> 00:19:45,029
and you didn't leave
a phone number.

369
00:19:45,053 --> 00:19:46,402
I don't have a phone.

370
00:19:48,012 --> 00:19:49,884
Part of preparing for isolation.

371
00:19:50,537 --> 00:19:53,061
[chuckles]
Right, of course. Isolation.

372
00:19:53,801 --> 00:19:55,716
Well, we can underwrite
a policy,

373
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:59,720
but since this is
such a unique situation,

374
00:19:59,894 --> 00:20:02,940
I just need a couple more details
so I can come up with a plan.

375
00:20:03,114 --> 00:20:06,466
Okay. I'm actually heading
somewhere right now.

376
00:20:07,423 --> 00:20:09,425
- [Alex] I'm late for something.
- Oh, okay.

377
00:20:09,991 --> 00:20:13,734
It's just a, a local
first aid course at the school.

378
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:17,259
- Dimitri usually helps me out with it.
- Can't tonight,

379
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:19,218
so busy. [chuckles]

380
00:20:19,392 --> 00:20:20,697
All of the plans.

381
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:24,919
Um, but you, you could come

382
00:20:25,963 --> 00:20:29,750
if you want. I mean, it would answer
some of your questions probably.

383
00:20:29,924 --> 00:20:31,360
You're learning first aid
for space.

384
00:20:31,534 --> 00:20:33,710
Yes, just locally at the moment,

385
00:20:33,884 --> 00:20:36,757
but they'll put us through a full
training course later down the line.

386
00:20:36,931 --> 00:20:37,931
Right.

387
00:20:38,585 --> 00:20:39,760
[gentle instrumental music]

388
00:20:39,934 --> 00:20:41,414
But I, I have to go right now.

389
00:20:41,979 --> 00:20:44,721
Oh, okay, okay. Yeah, yeah.

390
00:20:44,895 --> 00:20:46,636
- Yeah.
- Great, great.

391
00:20:47,768 --> 00:20:50,050
- Yeah. Oh.
- Yeah, yeah, sorry. I gotta take these to the front.

392
00:20:50,074 --> 00:20:51,554
- Yeah, take your time.
- [exhales]

393
00:20:52,338 --> 00:20:54,905
All right, CPR Warriors.
Picture this.

394
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:57,604
Your cousin has jumped
into the pool, can't swim,

395
00:20:57,778 --> 00:21:00,563
and is now drowning.
You must resuscitate her.

396
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,349
Begin.

397
00:21:04,001 --> 00:21:05,525
And for you, Alex,

398
00:21:05,699 --> 00:21:07,619
Daisy here has taken
her helmet off for too long.

399
00:21:07,657 --> 00:21:09,224
Oh, then she'd be dead
instantly.

400
00:21:09,398 --> 00:21:10,398
Why?

401
00:21:10,834 --> 00:21:12,532
Because
there's very little oxygen.

402
00:21:12,706 --> 00:21:14,708
Well, let's say there is oxygen.

403
00:21:14,882 --> 00:21:16,318
There isn't. She'd be dead.

404
00:21:16,492 --> 00:21:20,104
[sighs] Then, say,
she fell into a pool, too,

405
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,019
but the pool is on Mars.

406
00:21:22,193 --> 00:21:23,412
Resuscitate her.

407
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:28,678
All right, everyone,
remember, CPR.

408
00:21:28,852 --> 00:21:31,681
- Am I supposed to be drowning?
Okay. -[Alex] Um, yeah.

409
00:21:31,855 --> 00:21:33,988
[clears throat] I'm so sorry.
I did not realize

410
00:21:34,162 --> 00:21:36,295
- we were doing CPR tonight.
- [Renee] Good job, Scott.

411
00:21:36,469 --> 00:21:38,621
- You have to watch the angle of the neck.
- Sure, you didn't.

412
00:21:38,645 --> 00:21:40,124
- [exhales] Hm.
- [Renee] Alex.

413
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,389
She's dying. Save her now.

414
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:46,305
Hm, and, uh...

415
00:21:46,957 --> 00:21:50,047
- This... -[Renee] That's great.
Everyone pushing.

416
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:51,658
[Alex]
Uh...

417
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:53,462
[Renee]
All right, over the lungs.

418
00:21:53,486 --> 00:21:54,574
- [man] Thanks.
- [exhales]

419
00:21:57,577 --> 00:21:58,945
[Alex] Then I do the
thing with the mouth.

420
00:21:58,969 --> 00:22:00,493
That's great.
Uh, that makes sense.

421
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:02,277
Um, [clears throat] okay.

422
00:22:02,451 --> 00:22:04,801
And then this part. Okay.

423
00:22:05,628 --> 00:22:06,760
[coughs]

424
00:22:06,934 --> 00:22:07,717
- Oh.
- [Daisy] Oh,

425
00:22:07,891 --> 00:22:08,891
you're doing it wrong.

426
00:22:08,936 --> 00:22:10,241
How about I just show you?

427
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:11,456
- Yeah, yeah.
- [Alex] Okay.

428
00:22:12,548 --> 00:22:13,548
No, I...

429
00:22:14,071 --> 00:22:16,422
- I was a swimmer, remember?
- Right, yup.

430
00:22:17,597 --> 00:22:18,641
[sighs]

431
00:22:19,773 --> 00:22:20,774
[exhales]

432
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:23,385
- Okay.
- [Renee] You're all doing great.

433
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:25,735
Just another two minutes to go.

434
00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:27,389
- [exhales]
- Check the pulse.

435
00:22:28,216 --> 00:22:30,827
- Okay.
- [Renee] Bravo, Daisy.

436
00:22:31,001 --> 00:22:32,829
[Renee]
After surviving a near drowning,

437
00:22:33,003 --> 00:22:34,590
-she has pulled Alex from the water...
-[laughs]

438
00:22:34,614 --> 00:22:36,616
[Renee]
and now saved his life.

439
00:22:41,316 --> 00:22:43,100
[gasps] Is this an art room?

440
00:22:43,274 --> 00:22:46,060
Sorry. I thought we'd be tying
bandages or something.

441
00:22:46,234 --> 00:22:48,932
Yeah, you said that
already twice. Oh.

442
00:22:49,933 --> 00:22:52,501
There are some
real Picassos in here.

443
00:22:53,763 --> 00:22:55,417
This is my favorite subject.

444
00:22:55,896 --> 00:22:56,896
Nice.

445
00:22:58,551 --> 00:23:01,684
Really? I thought
you would be more quantitative.

446
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,991
Math and science?

447
00:23:05,035 --> 00:23:08,387
Yeah, don't get me wrong.
I was great at those.

448
00:23:09,953 --> 00:23:10,953
[Alex mumbles]
All right.

449
00:23:17,004 --> 00:23:18,179
Do you still swim?

450
00:23:18,353 --> 00:23:20,137
[clicks tongue] Never.

451
00:23:20,311 --> 00:23:21,748
But it was your life.

452
00:23:22,966 --> 00:23:24,838
Yep, and now it's not.

453
00:23:29,103 --> 00:23:30,539
[instrumental music]

454
00:23:30,713 --> 00:23:33,020
[inhales] Well, it always helps
to remember that

455
00:23:33,194 --> 00:23:35,041
we're just living on a rock,
hurtling through space,

456
00:23:35,065 --> 00:23:37,459
and our meaningless existence
can end at any moment.

457
00:23:37,633 --> 00:23:38,939
Doesn't it keep me
warm at night?

458
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,158
[chuckles] Sorry.

459
00:23:48,862 --> 00:23:51,168
I'm gonna give a talk
to the kids here next week.

460
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:54,258
About space? Can I come?

461
00:23:54,955 --> 00:23:55,955
Why?

462
00:23:55,999 --> 00:23:57,261
Maybe I wanna learn more

463
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,089
about my meaningless existence.

464
00:24:01,614 --> 00:24:02,658
Okay.

465
00:24:03,572 --> 00:24:06,314
Sure, yeah,
then you should come.

466
00:24:10,536 --> 00:24:12,581
She's just doing my insurance.

467
00:24:12,755 --> 00:24:14,888
A woman named Martha
does my insurance.

468
00:24:15,062 --> 00:24:17,107
- Have you heard me talk about her?
- No.

469
00:24:17,717 --> 00:24:20,023
Yeah, that's 'cause
Martha is a hoarder

470
00:24:20,197 --> 00:24:22,025
who dresses like
she died on the Titanic.

471
00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:24,463
- Hm.
- You gotta take these opportunities

472
00:24:24,637 --> 00:24:25,917
when they fall in your lap, bro.

473
00:24:26,552 --> 00:24:27,640
It's not like that.

474
00:24:27,814 --> 00:24:29,119
Make it like that.

475
00:24:30,338 --> 00:24:31,948
[chuckles]

476
00:24:32,122 --> 00:24:35,125
[bright instrumental music]

477
00:25:03,806 --> 00:25:05,591
No, no, no, no.
Do not let Colin do it.

478
00:25:05,765 --> 00:25:07,462
He'll try and poach
the entire...

479
00:25:08,898 --> 00:25:10,702
Okay, look, I'll type something
up tonight, and you're gonna say

480
00:25:10,726 --> 00:25:13,033
that you did it because I'm,
I'm not losing that account.

481
00:25:13,729 --> 00:25:14,904
Okay.

482
00:25:15,078 --> 00:25:16,427
[line disconnects]

483
00:25:18,168 --> 00:25:20,127
- [clears throat]
- What's Peter doing here?

484
00:25:20,301 --> 00:25:22,172
I asked him
to appraise the farm.

485
00:25:24,392 --> 00:25:27,308
- Get him off my property.
- When he's done.

486
00:25:27,482 --> 00:25:29,179
I told you I'm not selling.

487
00:25:29,832 --> 00:25:32,748
Yeah, I know, and I think
you should reconsider.

488
00:25:32,922 --> 00:25:35,751
Well, it's not your farm,
Elizabeth.

489
00:25:35,925 --> 00:25:37,231
You don't get to make the call.

490
00:25:37,405 --> 00:25:39,233
Dad, you can't keep
going like this.

491
00:25:39,407 --> 00:25:41,017
You're working yourself
to the bone.

492
00:25:41,627 --> 00:25:43,672
I'm fine. I have Dimitri.

493
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:45,674
Really? He's not enough.

494
00:25:45,848 --> 00:25:48,285
[sighs] Alex helps.

495
00:25:48,459 --> 00:25:51,201
Only when he's not off
pretending to board spaceships.

496
00:25:53,508 --> 00:25:55,597
Mom can't even finish a bouquet.

497
00:25:57,251 --> 00:25:59,383
How are profits
without, uh, flower design?

498
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,779
This isn't sustainable, Dad.
You should be retired.

499
00:26:04,388 --> 00:26:05,868
I'll retire
when I hand the farm over.

500
00:26:05,999 --> 00:26:07,391
Over to whom?

501
00:26:08,349 --> 00:26:09,785
Look, I know
you had a plan before,

502
00:26:09,959 --> 00:26:11,831
but you don't have
a successor anymore.

503
00:26:12,614 --> 00:26:14,181
You need a new plan.

504
00:26:14,964 --> 00:26:17,725
- Maybe seeing some figures will help.
- It's not about the money, Liz.

505
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:20,840
Well, you're not exactly handing
over the Byzantine Empire, okay?

506
00:26:21,014 --> 00:26:24,583
They're just flowers. They don't do
anything. They don't really matter.

507
00:26:28,064 --> 00:26:30,719
I'm afraid we're gonna have
to agree to disagree there.

508
00:26:32,939 --> 00:26:35,158
How can you
even stand to be here?

509
00:26:36,203 --> 00:26:37,465
He's everywhere.

510
00:26:40,033 --> 00:26:42,818
I'm not selling.
It will go to a developer.

511
00:26:42,992 --> 00:26:46,387
And if we continue down that
path, there will be no farms left.

512
00:26:46,953 --> 00:26:49,477
We'll have to import even more
from halfway around the globe.

513
00:26:50,304 --> 00:26:51,479
No, Liz, we,

514
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,047
we gotta hold on to our farms.

515
00:26:54,525 --> 00:26:56,049
This is our spot.

516
00:26:56,745 --> 00:26:59,313
It's our little corner
of the world...

517
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:02,011
and I'm not giving it up.

518
00:27:02,838 --> 00:27:04,274
Send Peter home.

519
00:27:05,188 --> 00:27:07,713
Don't you dare
show me the value.

520
00:27:09,976 --> 00:27:10,976
[sighs]

521
00:27:17,723 --> 00:27:18,723
[exhales]

522
00:27:19,725 --> 00:27:23,380
For 210 days,
I'm gonna travel there in this,

523
00:27:23,554 --> 00:27:27,384
and then, this will be my home.

524
00:27:27,558 --> 00:27:30,779
This is where
I'll work, explore,

525
00:27:31,345 --> 00:27:34,435
marry, pioneer...

526
00:27:35,784 --> 00:27:37,351
and die.

527
00:27:39,353 --> 00:27:40,659
Mars is where I'll die.

528
00:27:42,095 --> 00:27:44,488
And this is for children?

529
00:27:45,054 --> 00:27:46,054
Yeah.

530
00:27:46,447 --> 00:27:48,884
And you must end on dying.

531
00:27:49,058 --> 00:27:51,495
That is how it ends.

532
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,802
But you really want to bring
that up to first graders?

533
00:27:54,455 --> 00:27:57,414
- Second graders.
- Maybe you should talk more of space adventures.

534
00:27:58,067 --> 00:28:01,505
Like discovering aliens,
or, or, or racing rovers.

535
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,029
Oh, oh. Oh.

536
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:05,379
Playing basketball.

537
00:28:06,554 --> 00:28:07,773
That's Space Jam.

538
00:28:07,947 --> 00:28:08,947
Ah, yes.

539
00:28:10,514 --> 00:28:12,386
I do not think
they would realize this though.

540
00:28:12,952 --> 00:28:14,649
But that's not real, Dimitri.

541
00:28:14,823 --> 00:28:17,347
[sighs] Well, this is
not yet real either.

542
00:28:17,521 --> 00:28:18,871
But it will be.

543
00:28:19,523 --> 00:28:21,438
That's the difference.

544
00:28:21,612 --> 00:28:23,440
Let me see it again. [claps]

545
00:28:23,614 --> 00:28:24,703
[sighs]

546
00:28:25,181 --> 00:28:28,010
So, they're sending you to Mars,

547
00:28:28,489 --> 00:28:31,274
but they only care
about my medical opinion.

548
00:28:31,448 --> 00:28:33,624
I don't usually work for NASA.

549
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:35,452
Well, you were approved.

550
00:28:35,626 --> 00:28:39,369
How? I deal in flu shots
and diaper rash.

551
00:28:40,457 --> 00:28:42,914
You need the kind of doctor that
doesn't have these on their desk.

552
00:28:42,938 --> 00:28:45,985
Well, I, I mean, how do you know
that NASA doesn't have lollipops?

553
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:47,987
Some wild guess.

554
00:28:48,161 --> 00:28:50,859
Okay.
Just the standard physical.

555
00:28:51,033 --> 00:28:53,557
Great.
It will be easy, you know.

556
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,559
- You still disease free?
- Mm-hmm.

557
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,910
Open. Close.

558
00:28:58,084 --> 00:28:59,346
[thermometer beeps]

559
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,827
- Any alcohol or drug habits?
- Uh-uh.

560
00:29:02,001 --> 00:29:04,786
Hmm. You know, they didn't
even ask for a TB test.

561
00:29:06,309 --> 00:29:09,138
- They have one of those just to move countries.
-[thermometer beeps]

562
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,029
I'm sure they will at, at some
point down the line though.

563
00:29:12,446 --> 00:29:13,446
Hmm.

564
00:29:17,451 --> 00:29:20,454
- Oh, your joints are fit for space travel.
- Great.

565
00:29:20,628 --> 00:29:22,673
- Ten years might be a whole other story.
- Right.

566
00:29:22,848 --> 00:29:26,373
Oh, I'm, I'm... I'll be
all right. I'm keeping fit.

567
00:29:28,941 --> 00:29:31,465
- How's your mental health?
- It's fine.

568
00:29:32,379 --> 00:29:33,946
No, you don't get
to decide that.

569
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,774
Just how are you feeling?

570
00:29:36,426 --> 00:29:37,732
Fantastic.

571
00:29:38,211 --> 00:29:40,256
You willing to see
a psychologist to confirm that?

572
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,780
Nah.

573
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:46,219
So you're asking me to sign off
on your psych evaluation as well?

574
00:29:47,263 --> 00:29:49,439
- Yep.
- Hmm.

575
00:29:51,615 --> 00:29:53,735
-[children giggling] - It's
nice of you to support him.

576
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,229
I wanna make sure he doesn't
say anything unhinged.

577
00:29:56,751 --> 00:29:58,057
This is so irresponsible.

578
00:29:58,231 --> 00:29:59,710
- They're children.
- [bell rings]

579
00:29:59,885 --> 00:30:02,191
He's not telling them
unicorns exist, Lizzie.

580
00:30:02,365 --> 00:30:03,497
Hmm.

581
00:30:03,671 --> 00:30:05,586
Oh, just in time. There he is.

582
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,763
[chuckles] I'm so proud of you.
This is such a good thing

583
00:30:08,937 --> 00:30:10,678
that you're doing.
This is so good.

584
00:30:11,548 --> 00:30:12,985
Ah, you're on vacation.

585
00:30:13,724 --> 00:30:16,336
Uh, well, sometimes inferior
colleagues use that as an opportunity

586
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:19,556
to attempt coups
on your accounts.

587
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:21,080
Okay,
so when I'm with my clients,

588
00:30:21,254 --> 00:30:23,125
I tell them
to stick to the story.

589
00:30:23,299 --> 00:30:24,823
- Hm.
- And your story is space.

590
00:30:25,388 --> 00:30:29,001
Not you in space,
because that's a hypothetical,

591
00:30:29,175 --> 00:30:30,306
but space.

592
00:30:30,872 --> 00:30:32,656
But I'm going to space.

593
00:30:34,397 --> 00:30:36,898
Do you think we could just keep it
to what's real right now though?

594
00:30:36,922 --> 00:30:38,097
Are we paying you for this?

595
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,751
Could you, please,
just teach them facts?

596
00:30:40,926 --> 00:30:42,726
And when you have a shuttle
and a launch date,

597
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,843
you can come back
and tell them about the mission.

598
00:30:45,017 --> 00:30:46,192
Yeah, sure.

599
00:30:46,932 --> 00:30:49,717
- [Liz] What are you looking at?
- Well, someone might come

600
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:53,503
- Yeah, it is how hallways work.
- No, someone I invited.

601
00:30:53,677 --> 00:30:55,723
Okay. Focus.

602
00:30:58,595 --> 00:31:00,336
[Alex exhales]
All right.

603
00:31:01,381 --> 00:31:04,036
I, I heard you guys were
learning about the solar system.

604
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:05,752
[kid 1 whispers]
This is making me sleepy.

605
00:31:05,776 --> 00:31:07,256
[yawns]

606
00:31:08,997 --> 00:31:10,496
[kid 2 whispers]
Can I get out of this class?

607
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:14,046
Um, you guys
got a favorite planet?

608
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:17,484
- [kid 3] Stupid planets.
- [kid 4] This is so boring.

609
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,791
[mellow music]

610
00:31:20,966 --> 00:31:22,228
How about this? Everybody up.

611
00:31:22,402 --> 00:31:24,012
[sighs] All right. Wow.

612
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:26,536
We're just gonna
have you sit over there.

613
00:31:28,712 --> 00:31:29,888
Okay.

614
00:31:34,109 --> 00:31:38,331
Okay. Blake, if you could go
to the center of the room.

615
00:31:39,723 --> 00:31:42,988
You are going to be the sun.

616
00:31:43,684 --> 00:31:45,599
The center of our solar system.

617
00:31:45,773 --> 00:31:47,688
Everybody orbits around you.

618
00:31:48,297 --> 00:31:49,297
Hi.

619
00:31:50,299 --> 00:31:51,822
Could you stand near Blake?

620
00:31:52,954 --> 00:31:56,349
Now, you are
going to be Mercury.

621
00:31:56,523 --> 00:32:00,962
It only takes you
88 days to orbit Blake,

622
00:32:01,136 --> 00:32:03,747
so you're gonna be
moving kinda quickly

623
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,272
like this.

624
00:32:07,316 --> 00:32:09,362
- [kid 5] Only 88 days?
- Perfect.

625
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:12,147
- Who wants to be Venus?
- Me, me, me.

626
00:32:12,321 --> 00:32:14,367
You. Great. Up.

627
00:32:14,541 --> 00:32:17,718
Okay, so you are
second closest to the sun

628
00:32:17,892 --> 00:32:19,633
and the brightest planet, okay?

629
00:32:19,807 --> 00:32:23,376
You're gonna orbit like that.

630
00:32:24,638 --> 00:32:26,683
[all chuckling]

631
00:32:26,857 --> 00:32:30,905
- Now, who would like to be Earth?
- I do.

632
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:35,475
Every time you go
all the way around Blake,

633
00:32:35,997 --> 00:32:39,261
it has been an entire year.

634
00:32:39,914 --> 00:32:42,656
Louie, you're gonna
be the moon, okay?

635
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:46,007
You're going to orbit Earth.
Now, go.

636
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,748
Fantastic.

637
00:32:50,011 --> 00:32:51,665
[children chuckling]

638
00:32:52,622 --> 00:32:54,363
Mars, Mars, Mars. Mars.

639
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:58,150
Okay. Mars is where
we'll live in the future.

640
00:32:58,324 --> 00:33:00,630
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, let's go.

641
00:33:01,718 --> 00:33:04,373
- You guys getting dizzy yet?
- [all] No!

642
00:33:04,547 --> 00:33:07,028
If everyone else could just come
and surround our planets.

643
00:33:07,202 --> 00:33:09,596
You're gonna be the stars
in the Milky Way galaxy.

644
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:12,599
Now, there are billions
and billions of you.

645
00:33:12,773 --> 00:33:15,341
- So imagine...
- Elizabeth, take the star.

646
00:33:16,211 --> 00:33:18,518
And that's the solar system.

647
00:33:18,692 --> 00:33:21,695
[indistinct chatter]

648
00:33:22,957 --> 00:33:23,957
[mouths] Hi.

649
00:33:25,264 --> 00:33:26,264
[mouths] Hi.

650
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:33,489
Okay, well, there's 100 billion
stars in the Milky Way galaxy,

651
00:33:33,663 --> 00:33:36,188
and there's maybe 10 trillion
galaxies in the universe.

652
00:33:36,362 --> 00:33:39,800
If you multiply that by 100
billion, you get an extremely rough,

653
00:33:39,974 --> 00:33:42,411
probably low estimate for
the amount of stars that exist.

654
00:33:42,585 --> 00:33:43,630
Which is?

655
00:33:44,239 --> 00:33:46,241
It's a 1 with 24 zeros after it.

656
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,897
We make the mistake of thinking
that the universe is for us,

657
00:33:50,071 --> 00:33:51,203
but it's not. It's...

658
00:33:51,377 --> 00:33:53,074
- It's...
- Okay. New rule.

659
00:33:53,248 --> 00:33:56,425
Every time you mention how
meaningless our existence is,

660
00:33:56,599 --> 00:33:59,602
I'm gonna need another drink,
and you have to join me.

661
00:33:59,776 --> 00:34:02,214
- Right.
- Come on.

662
00:34:03,302 --> 00:34:04,607
Right. Uh...

663
00:34:04,781 --> 00:34:06,653
[upbeat music playing
over speakers]

664
00:34:08,437 --> 00:34:09,482
[chuckles]

665
00:34:10,831 --> 00:34:13,964
[Alex] It... uh, oh, gosh,
it's right... No, I have it.

666
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:16,054
- I had it. Um...
- Okay.

667
00:34:16,228 --> 00:34:18,012
[blowing air]

668
00:34:18,491 --> 00:34:20,493
- Dais.
- No.

669
00:34:21,407 --> 00:34:23,496
- Dee-Dee.
- Don't you dare.

670
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:25,150
- [laughs]
- What?

671
00:34:25,324 --> 00:34:27,413
Look, I know that
Daisy is a tricky one.

672
00:34:27,587 --> 00:34:29,719
I mean, my coaches
used to call me Zee.

673
00:34:29,893 --> 00:34:32,374
- Mm-hmm.
- As in Lazy Daisy.

674
00:34:32,853 --> 00:34:35,073
Especially when I couldn't
make my time.

675
00:34:36,204 --> 00:34:39,425
It hurt a little. [chuckles]

676
00:34:40,165 --> 00:34:41,731
You must miss it.

677
00:34:42,776 --> 00:34:44,125
- Swimming?
- [Alex] Yeah.

678
00:34:44,299 --> 00:34:47,346
Yeah, it was my purpose,

679
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:52,742
and, um, now, I just don't know
where I belong.

680
00:34:53,874 --> 00:34:56,703
I don't know what to do
with the hours in the day.

681
00:34:56,877 --> 00:35:00,620
I don't know what to do
on this planet.

682
00:35:01,229 --> 00:35:03,188
I don't know what to do
with my hands. [chuckles]

683
00:35:04,537 --> 00:35:07,105
- I don't know.
- Nobody's good at just one thing.

684
00:35:07,279 --> 00:35:09,281
- Yeah.
- You're really good at first aid.

685
00:35:10,195 --> 00:35:12,719
But you don't love it.

686
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,027
Oh, my gosh, it's the Martian.

687
00:35:17,202 --> 00:35:19,813
- What?
- Your nickname.

688
00:35:19,987 --> 00:35:21,162
Is it too on the nose?

689
00:35:21,336 --> 00:35:23,295
It feels obvious,
but it's so good.

690
00:35:23,469 --> 00:35:25,340
[laughs] Okay.

691
00:35:25,514 --> 00:35:28,082
Well, I...
It beats the current one.

692
00:35:28,256 --> 00:35:29,344
Which is?

693
00:35:29,518 --> 00:35:31,041
Alexander the Great.

694
00:35:31,738 --> 00:35:33,131
Really?

695
00:35:33,305 --> 00:35:36,351
Yeah, we were named
after historical figures.

696
00:35:37,352 --> 00:35:40,790
Elizabeth, Thomas, Alexander.

697
00:35:40,964 --> 00:35:43,097
So the conqueror,
the queen, and the inventor.

698
00:35:43,271 --> 00:35:44,271
[Alex]
Yep.

699
00:35:45,795 --> 00:35:48,624
That's, like, not too much
to live up to.

700
00:35:48,798 --> 00:35:50,626
Oh, no, not at all.
He had just conquered

701
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,802
half the known world
by the time he was 32.

702
00:35:52,976 --> 00:35:56,197
So, you've got time.
I mean, he didn't go to Mars.

703
00:35:56,371 --> 00:35:59,548
It was not like they could fathom
that there were even other planets.

704
00:35:59,722 --> 00:36:01,202
- You can't...
- All right. Bartender!

705
00:36:01,376 --> 00:36:02,464
- Bar...
- [lightning crashes]

706
00:36:02,638 --> 00:36:04,771
- Oh, wow.
- That's a storm.

707
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:08,383
- Um, you don't have to walk me home.
- Wow.

708
00:36:08,557 --> 00:36:11,212
No, I, I'm not afraid
of the rain.

709
00:36:11,386 --> 00:36:13,756
-[woman 1] I'll see you later. -[woman
2] Nah, just like that is fine.

710
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:16,696
At least you won't have to worry
about rain on Mars. Whoa.

711
00:36:17,436 --> 00:36:21,440
No, just solar flares that cause storms
that lasts for hundreds of years.

712
00:36:21,614 --> 00:36:22,974
Okay. When I said
I didn't need you

713
00:36:23,093 --> 00:36:25,052
to walk me home,
I meant literally.

714
00:36:25,705 --> 00:36:26,705
It's so close.

715
00:36:27,968 --> 00:36:29,491
This is a building site.

716
00:36:30,144 --> 00:36:33,060
It is rustic,
and Mike is fixing it up.

717
00:36:35,062 --> 00:36:37,630
Well, have a slow night.

718
00:36:39,849 --> 00:36:41,242
That is funny. [chuckles]

719
00:36:42,069 --> 00:36:43,766
Um, I...

720
00:36:46,769 --> 00:36:48,815
[thunder crashing]

721
00:36:48,989 --> 00:36:52,166
[romantic instrumental music]

722
00:37:04,352 --> 00:37:05,352
[bag crashes]

723
00:37:11,141 --> 00:37:12,708
- Bedroom.
- What?

724
00:37:13,187 --> 00:37:14,797
- Bedroom.
- Oh.

725
00:37:14,971 --> 00:37:16,146
[chuckles]

726
00:37:16,321 --> 00:37:18,627
- Oh, yeah.
- Wait. Come here.

727
00:37:21,717 --> 00:37:23,371
Through the door, you barbarian.

728
00:37:23,545 --> 00:37:25,112
[laughs]

729
00:37:35,644 --> 00:37:37,124
Um, I just... um...

730
00:37:38,473 --> 00:37:39,561
Is this okay?

731
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,303
- Yeah.
- Okay.

732
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:12,812
[calm instrumental music]

733
00:38:23,431 --> 00:38:25,738
[heavy breathing]

734
00:38:33,659 --> 00:38:36,052
[exhales]

735
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:38,619
[sighs]

736
00:38:41,362 --> 00:38:44,017
[Jeff] That was the first
rain we've had in a month.

737
00:38:44,191 --> 00:38:46,933
[Liz] Great. Uh, have you
looked into this Mars company?

738
00:38:47,455 --> 00:38:50,153
If you're gonna follow me
around, at least help.

739
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:53,809
Well, if you're gonna refuse to sell,
at least prepare for the drought.

740
00:38:53,983 --> 00:38:56,029
How am I supposed
to do that? [grunts]

741
00:38:56,203 --> 00:38:58,423
For one, switch
to drought-resistant varieties.

742
00:38:58,597 --> 00:39:00,773
Get a more efficient
irrigation system.

743
00:39:00,947 --> 00:39:02,577
And next year,
only irrigate half the land.

744
00:39:02,601 --> 00:39:04,254
Half the land, half the profits.

745
00:39:04,429 --> 00:39:07,040
Yeah, well, you're losing
half the crops regardless,

746
00:39:07,214 --> 00:39:09,216
if you don't have enough water,
which you won't.

747
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,305
[grunts] Oh.

748
00:39:11,479 --> 00:39:14,264
It's a bad time to invest
in drip irrigation then.

749
00:39:14,439 --> 00:39:17,833
[Liz] Actually, it's the perfect
time while we still have reserves.

750
00:39:19,139 --> 00:39:21,315
So you think this Mars thing
might be a scam?

751
00:39:21,489 --> 00:39:22,489
What do you think?

752
00:39:24,187 --> 00:39:25,493
I should show you something.

753
00:39:26,102 --> 00:39:27,102
Come on.

754
00:39:36,939 --> 00:39:39,028
- How long does he spend on this?
- Hours.

755
00:39:39,812 --> 00:39:41,117
You know what this is, right?

756
00:39:42,467 --> 00:39:46,035
It's a very sophisticated version
of the machine that they built

757
00:39:46,209 --> 00:39:49,038
for the science fair that year
we had a really bad dry season.

758
00:39:49,212 --> 00:39:50,475
Oh, man.

759
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,781
Dad, what are we gonna do?

760
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,740
He's given up on his career.

761
00:39:54,914 --> 00:39:57,743
He's building machines
for another planet.

762
00:39:57,917 --> 00:40:00,876
He's spending all of his money
on merchandise.

763
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:02,356
He's been to see Dr. Olsen.

764
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:03,966
What? For what?

765
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,664
His space physical.

766
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:08,362
Okay. Well, then she knows
that he's insane.

767
00:40:08,536 --> 00:40:10,582
We have to go see her.
Maybe she can help.

768
00:40:10,756 --> 00:40:13,106
- Ah.
- Look, I know it seems harmless now.

769
00:40:13,715 --> 00:40:15,282
But what if it progresses?

770
00:40:15,456 --> 00:40:17,980
What if we could have helped
and we didn't?

771
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:20,418
[sighs]

772
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:22,150
You can't tell your mother.

773
00:40:22,245 --> 00:40:24,422
Okay. I'll get the car.

774
00:40:26,902 --> 00:40:30,776
Doctor-patient confidentiality
means what it sounds like it means.

775
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:33,779
- This is different. It's Alex.
- A patient.

776
00:40:33,953 --> 00:40:35,233
You've told me about him before.

777
00:40:35,345 --> 00:40:36,956
Yes, when he was a child.

778
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:39,262
- Sue, I know it's breaking protocol.
- The law.

779
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,264
Well, we're concerned.

780
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,005
Doesn't mean
I'm gonna break the law.

781
00:40:43,179 --> 00:40:45,138
Well, I am not leaving.

782
00:40:46,095 --> 00:40:48,010
What if I break out
one of these?

783
00:40:49,011 --> 00:40:51,318
Are your immunizations
up to date?

784
00:40:53,189 --> 00:40:55,627
Oh. Sometimes at night,

785
00:40:55,801 --> 00:40:57,521
I still hear screams
from your measles shot.

786
00:40:57,629 --> 00:41:00,240
Okay. Give us the information,

787
00:41:00,414 --> 00:41:02,634
and you can give me
the tetanus booster.

788
00:41:03,722 --> 00:41:06,028
Your brother is not crazy.

789
00:41:06,638 --> 00:41:09,597
He probably has
a slight delusion, but...

790
00:41:09,771 --> 00:41:12,948
You yourself were once convinced
you were a wizard.

791
00:41:13,122 --> 00:41:14,515
I was ten.

792
00:41:14,689 --> 00:41:17,605
- This is dangerous.
- No, it is not.

793
00:41:17,779 --> 00:41:20,347
So far he's just,
he's just living out a fantasy.

794
00:41:20,521 --> 00:41:23,263
What matters is,
it has given him a purpose.

795
00:41:23,437 --> 00:41:25,265
Wouldn't a job
do the same thing?

796
00:41:25,439 --> 00:41:28,050
Do you know how many
Mensa members are unemployed?

797
00:41:28,834 --> 00:41:30,226
More than you think.

798
00:41:30,879 --> 00:41:35,536
What you have is an exceptionally
intelligent son, Jeff.

799
00:41:37,146 --> 00:41:39,801
Those types often have
the hardest time coping.

800
00:41:40,454 --> 00:41:42,238
Maybe this is just something
he has to do.

801
00:41:42,412 --> 00:41:44,763
Okay, well, what about the fact
that it's space?

802
00:41:45,459 --> 00:41:47,287
He and Tom were obsessed.

803
00:41:47,461 --> 00:41:49,332
I'm sure it plays a part,

804
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,596
but what would you
have me say to him?

805
00:41:53,032 --> 00:41:54,903
Right, would he even listen?

806
00:41:56,731 --> 00:41:59,952
We all have our distractions.
You have looked at that phone

807
00:42:00,126 --> 00:42:01,538
- ten times since you walked in.
- [notification chimes]

808
00:42:01,562 --> 00:42:03,825
[sighs, clears throat]

809
00:42:04,826 --> 00:42:06,959
Did you ever see the therapist
that I recommended?

810
00:42:07,133 --> 00:42:08,980
- [scoffs] I don't have time.
- [notification chimes]

811
00:42:09,004 --> 00:42:10,353
- [phone keys clacking]
- Mm.

812
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,052
Lead a horse to water. Okay.

813
00:42:15,402 --> 00:42:16,534
Sit still.

814
00:42:17,622 --> 00:42:18,710
[sighs]

815
00:42:18,884 --> 00:42:21,234
[Renee]
All right, CPR warriors.

816
00:42:21,408 --> 00:42:23,628
- [Daisy] Hi.
- Oh, um...

817
00:42:24,193 --> 00:42:25,953
- [Renee] We're about to begin.
- [Alex] ...hi.

818
00:42:27,849 --> 00:42:29,547
- I, I just...
- [Renee] Wonderful.

819
00:42:29,721 --> 00:42:33,072
I should apologize, uh, I...
About sneaking out.

820
00:42:33,246 --> 00:42:35,596
Oh, the woman that
you hung out with a few times

821
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:37,467
doesn't want to talk about it,

822
00:42:37,642 --> 00:42:40,645
but the insurance agent
who works for you does.

823
00:42:40,819 --> 00:42:42,037
Okay.

824
00:42:42,211 --> 00:42:43,909
- Things happened.
- [Alex] I remember.

825
00:42:44,779 --> 00:42:48,000
- It didn't mean anything.
- No, we, we were drunk.

826
00:42:48,696 --> 00:42:49,696
[chuckles] Yeah.

827
00:42:51,394 --> 00:42:53,353
[Renee]
Take your places, lifesavers.

828
00:42:57,009 --> 00:42:59,185
- [clears throat]
- [Renee] Let's go, people.

829
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:01,491
- Heimlich maneuver.
- Sorry. So, what are we doing?

830
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:04,277
- The Heimlich maneuver.
- No, I mean, you and me.

831
00:43:06,061 --> 00:43:07,454
I figured we could be friends.

832
00:43:08,237 --> 00:43:11,066
Really? Okay.
I didn't think you'd want to.

833
00:43:12,067 --> 00:43:13,765
Why? Because you're odd?

834
00:43:14,461 --> 00:43:15,810
Because I'm leaving the planet.

835
00:43:16,637 --> 00:43:18,073
Oh, I don't mind that.

836
00:43:19,118 --> 00:43:20,554
Okay. Then sure, yeah.

837
00:43:20,728 --> 00:43:22,991
[Renee]
Patients, begin choking.

838
00:43:23,165 --> 00:43:24,725
- [whispers] Okay, that was...
- [choking]

839
00:43:24,863 --> 00:43:27,866
- Lifesavers, start your saving.
- Go on.

840
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,651
-[chokes] - What, um... You're
not gonna show me how to do it?

841
00:43:30,825 --> 00:43:32,566
- You're on your own, kid.
- [sighs]

842
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:34,481
[grunts] Don't kill me.

843
00:43:34,655 --> 00:43:37,658
[panting]

844
00:43:37,832 --> 00:43:39,965
[bright instrumental music]

845
00:43:49,365 --> 00:43:51,150
- [timer beeps]
- [Daisy] Come on.

846
00:43:51,324 --> 00:43:52,804
[both panting]

847
00:43:52,978 --> 00:43:55,110
Yesterday you were
28 seconds faster.

848
00:43:55,284 --> 00:43:57,112
As you know,
I completely regret this.

849
00:43:57,286 --> 00:43:58,505
[laughs]

850
00:43:58,679 --> 00:43:59,679
[grunts]

851
00:43:59,767 --> 00:44:00,855
[sighs]

852
00:44:03,336 --> 00:44:05,176
-[laughs] - We didn't
have fair competitiveness.

853
00:44:05,207 --> 00:44:06,731
What do you think this is?

854
00:44:07,993 --> 00:44:10,386
- Oh, my God. Look.
- [Blake] Coming in for landing.

855
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,912
- Whoa.
- [panting]

856
00:44:14,086 --> 00:44:15,391
Wow.

857
00:44:16,131 --> 00:44:17,916
Hey, there he is.

858
00:44:24,052 --> 00:44:26,664
[whistling]

859
00:44:26,838 --> 00:44:28,990
-[Liz] I didn't know you could do that.
-[gasps, exhales]

860
00:44:29,014 --> 00:44:31,581
- Well, it was nice.
- Thank you. [exhales]

861
00:44:31,756 --> 00:44:33,472
You're gonna help me install
this in the dahlia fields,

862
00:44:33,496 --> 00:44:34,976
or you're gonna be
my nemesis forever.

863
00:44:36,891 --> 00:44:38,676
- Wh...
- It's a drip irrigation system.

864
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:41,461
That your father
doesn't know you're installing.

865
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:43,245
Correct.

866
00:44:44,507 --> 00:44:45,944
Okay. Yes,
I'm more scared of you.

867
00:44:46,118 --> 00:44:47,119
Good choice.

868
00:44:47,772 --> 00:44:50,513
[gentle instrumental music]

869
00:44:51,427 --> 00:44:53,908
[Alex] They're not some
magical forest thing.

870
00:44:54,082 --> 00:44:55,823
Like, they're not fairies.

871
00:44:55,997 --> 00:44:58,870
[chuckles] But today is the day
when most of them are out.

872
00:44:59,479 --> 00:45:00,959
Come on, we're almost there.

873
00:45:03,613 --> 00:45:05,006
How's living with your family?

874
00:45:05,528 --> 00:45:06,878
We used to get along better.

875
00:45:07,052 --> 00:45:08,052
So did mine.

876
00:45:08,749 --> 00:45:10,185
What happened?

877
00:45:10,359 --> 00:45:12,187
My parents were really,
really good coaches

878
00:45:12,361 --> 00:45:14,189
who suddenly didn't have
anyone to coach.

879
00:45:14,363 --> 00:45:15,363
Just me.

880
00:45:16,061 --> 00:45:17,715
- [sighs]
- What about yours?

881
00:45:19,151 --> 00:45:20,413
Um...

882
00:45:24,243 --> 00:45:25,418
[sighs]

883
00:45:25,592 --> 00:45:26,680
There was an accident...

884
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,336
not long ago. That...

885
00:45:31,511 --> 00:45:32,904
that did it.

886
00:45:36,777 --> 00:45:39,867
My brother saved my life.

887
00:45:45,351 --> 00:45:47,222
Sounds like a pretty great
big brother.

888
00:45:47,396 --> 00:45:48,397
Yeah.

889
00:45:50,443 --> 00:45:51,574
Yeah.

890
00:45:54,186 --> 00:45:55,187
He was.

891
00:46:02,411 --> 00:46:04,152
[clears throat]

892
00:46:04,979 --> 00:46:05,979
Are you okay?

893
00:46:06,546 --> 00:46:07,329
Yeah, I'm fine.

894
00:46:07,503 --> 00:46:09,505
I'm... fine.

895
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:11,072
It's just hot.

896
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:13,030
[exhales]

897
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:17,600
So where, where is this
bug family reunion then?

898
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:18,993
[chuckles]

899
00:46:19,167 --> 00:46:20,865
They're still setting up.

900
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:23,824
- DJ was late. You know how it is.
-[both laugh]

901
00:46:24,607 --> 00:46:27,045
- Ah.
- [chuckles] Did you kill it?

902
00:46:27,219 --> 00:46:29,699
- No.
- Then where is it?

903
00:46:30,265 --> 00:46:31,353
I don't know.

904
00:46:31,527 --> 00:46:32,527
Oh, wait.

905
00:46:33,442 --> 00:46:34,442
He's fine.

906
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:35,618
That's not the same one.

907
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:39,231
[both laughing]

908
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:40,840
Wow.

909
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:42,407
Wow.

910
00:46:43,148 --> 00:46:44,148
[chuckles]

911
00:46:45,585 --> 00:46:48,718
You realize you're getting joy
from a bug's ass lighting up.

912
00:46:48,893 --> 00:46:50,808
Oh, come on. So are you.

913
00:46:50,982 --> 00:46:51,982
No, I'm not.

914
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:53,941
Yes, you are.

915
00:46:54,899 --> 00:46:56,639
Watch them pretty, pretty butts.

916
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:58,163
[chuckles]

917
00:47:03,646 --> 00:47:05,779
Now, how could you think
about giving all this up?

918
00:47:10,958 --> 00:47:13,439
[calm instrumental music]

919
00:47:13,613 --> 00:47:15,571
[crickets chirping]

920
00:47:22,535 --> 00:47:24,798
[owl hooting]

921
00:47:31,805 --> 00:47:34,155
We're calling it
the Mars Grover.

922
00:47:34,329 --> 00:47:36,070
No, we're not doing that.

923
00:47:36,244 --> 00:47:37,985
- Uh-huh.
- Well, that sounds good.

924
00:47:38,159 --> 00:47:41,380
Anyway, this is how the world
will work in the future

925
00:47:41,554 --> 00:47:42,772
as it gets hotter and drier.

926
00:47:42,947 --> 00:47:45,036
Underground,
self-sustaining farms,

927
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:48,039
They already have one working in
an old tube station in London.

928
00:47:48,213 --> 00:47:50,084
I just have to figure out
how to make it work.

929
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:52,391
- On Mars.
- [Alex] Exactly.

930
00:47:52,565 --> 00:47:54,001
So the International
Space Station

931
00:47:54,175 --> 00:47:55,655
has some seeds growing.

932
00:47:55,829 --> 00:47:58,788
Uh, they even have
some sprouting on the moon.

933
00:47:58,963 --> 00:48:01,748
So, I just need to account for

934
00:48:02,531 --> 00:48:06,274
the lack of atmosphere,
gravity, radiation.

935
00:48:06,448 --> 00:48:08,320
This could go to NASA.

936
00:48:08,494 --> 00:48:10,800
I mean it, Alex.
This, this could be your thing.

937
00:48:10,975 --> 00:48:12,150
They're just

938
00:48:12,977 --> 00:48:14,935
- seeds.
- It's the survival part.

939
00:48:15,109 --> 00:48:17,218
I mean, you could send this to
the Rhode Island Space Consortium,

940
00:48:17,242 --> 00:48:20,462
and you could get funding
and a team and everything.

941
00:48:20,636 --> 00:48:22,900
Uh, I don't think
it'd be ready for that.

942
00:48:24,162 --> 00:48:26,555
Um, anyways, they could
probably use this inside.

943
00:48:30,777 --> 00:48:32,605
[indistinct chatter]

944
00:48:33,171 --> 00:48:35,042
[Jane]
Oh, this looks amazing.

945
00:48:35,738 --> 00:48:38,176
- Dimitri, could you take the potatoes, please?
- Mm-hmm.

946
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:39,438
Yes.

947
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,788
In Russia, we call them
kartofel.

948
00:48:42,571 --> 00:48:43,790
Beautiful language.

949
00:48:44,747 --> 00:48:48,012
Yes. Forget about the glory
of the word potato.

950
00:48:49,056 --> 00:48:51,450
Oh, well, could you take
the kartofelthen?

951
00:48:51,624 --> 00:48:52,799
- And, Liz?
- [Liz] Mom.

952
00:48:52,973 --> 00:48:54,366
- Elizabeth. Lizzie!
- [Liz] Mom.

953
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:55,952
- I'm doing something.
- Take the plates, please.

954
00:48:55,976 --> 00:48:57,195
- Can you help me?
- Yes.

955
00:48:57,369 --> 00:48:59,110
- Thank you.
- And come on, please.

956
00:48:59,284 --> 00:49:01,939
- Help me with the tarelki.
- Okay, comrade.

957
00:49:04,158 --> 00:49:05,812
- Well, that's inevitable.
- What?

958
00:49:06,813 --> 00:49:08,728
- Those two.
- [scoffs]

959
00:49:08,902 --> 00:49:11,383
Better chance of Putin
opening a wildlife sanctuary.

960
00:49:12,123 --> 00:49:13,123
I don't know.

961
00:49:13,689 --> 00:49:15,213
He's pretty charming.

962
00:49:15,387 --> 00:49:17,084
He said potatoes
in a different language.

963
00:49:17,258 --> 00:49:18,564
It was charming.

964
00:49:20,435 --> 00:49:21,435
Patata.

965
00:49:22,698 --> 00:49:25,092
- What? [chuckles]
- It's Spanish for potato.

966
00:49:25,266 --> 00:49:27,616
-[laughs] - Oh, look, they
didn't even take the potatoes.

967
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:30,358
- Daisy, could you just grab those, please?
- Yeah.

968
00:49:31,011 --> 00:49:33,579
- Okay, I'll take the patata.
- [chuckles]

969
00:49:33,753 --> 00:49:35,755
[gentle instrumental music]

970
00:49:35,929 --> 00:49:37,322
[Jeff]
Okay, what can I do?

971
00:49:37,496 --> 00:49:39,411
Uh, well, you could be here
half an hour ago,

972
00:49:39,585 --> 00:49:40,978
or you could take
the green beans.

973
00:49:41,152 --> 00:49:42,892
[door creaks]

974
00:49:49,029 --> 00:49:50,029
[door closes]

975
00:49:50,161 --> 00:49:52,163
[indistinct chatter]

976
00:49:52,337 --> 00:49:54,358
-[Jane laughs] -[Jeff] Where'd
you get that shirt, Dimitri?

977
00:49:54,382 --> 00:49:56,950
[Dimitri] I think, um,
from the Salvation Army.

978
00:49:57,124 --> 00:49:59,257
- [Jeff] Mm-hmm.
- [Dimitri] Very cheap.

979
00:49:59,431 --> 00:50:01,322
- [Jeff] Well, you wore it well.
- [Dimitri] They're good quality.

980
00:50:01,346 --> 00:50:02,453
- [Alex]... Mars
- [Daisy] Yeah.

981
00:50:02,477 --> 00:50:04,262
[indistinct chatter]

982
00:50:04,436 --> 00:50:06,414
-[Alex]Well, there are many done. Once in a while...
- Um,

983
00:50:06,438 --> 00:50:08,918
- so, Daisy, you seem normal.
- [Dimitri laughs]

984
00:50:09,441 --> 00:50:10,441
[Daisy]
Relatively.

985
00:50:11,573 --> 00:50:13,923
- [Liz] How do you tolerate Alex?
- [Jane] Uh, Liz?

986
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:17,014
- He's not the worst.
- [Alex] Thank you.

987
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:21,061
You're, uh, you're not an
investigative reporter, are you?

988
00:50:21,235 --> 00:50:22,367
Are you?

989
00:50:23,672 --> 00:50:25,592
I read a profile
on one of the British applicants

990
00:50:25,631 --> 00:50:26,980
who revealed everything

991
00:50:27,154 --> 00:50:28,721
to a reporter
feigning friendship.

992
00:50:28,895 --> 00:50:30,592
- [Alex sighs]
- [Liz] Daisy, you get it.

993
00:50:30,766 --> 00:50:32,377
Yeah. I mean, it's all right.

994
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:33,769
- I'm not a reporter.
- [sighs]

995
00:50:33,943 --> 00:50:34,943
That's great.

996
00:50:35,293 --> 00:50:36,493
[Liz]
Although crossed arms are

997
00:50:36,642 --> 00:50:38,470
- a sign of defense.
- I mean, really,

998
00:50:38,644 --> 00:50:40,839
Elizabeth, who wouldn't be
defensive under this interrogation?

999
00:50:40,863 --> 00:50:42,648
I am just looking out
for my brother.

1000
00:50:42,822 --> 00:50:44,495
- No, you're looking out for yourself.
-[Jane] Okay,

1001
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:45,303
- Alexander, Elizabeth.
- [Liz] Oh, my God, come on.

1002
00:50:45,477 --> 00:50:46,608
[Jane]
Hey, stop.

1003
00:50:48,436 --> 00:50:50,351
- [Liz] Okay.
- [Jeff] Mm.

1004
00:50:51,352 --> 00:50:53,963
- I'm sorry.
- I heard about their names, Mrs. McAllister.

1005
00:50:54,138 --> 00:50:55,748
- They really suit them.
- Oh, God.

1006
00:50:55,922 --> 00:50:56,923
No, we don't.

1007
00:50:57,619 --> 00:50:59,926
Well, I mean, you run a PR firm.

1008
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:02,233
Alex is about to conquer space.
It fits.

1009
00:51:02,407 --> 00:51:03,625
[Jane]
I certainly hope so.

1010
00:51:03,799 --> 00:51:06,454
I spent my pregnancies
buried in books.

1011
00:51:06,628 --> 00:51:09,694
Well, what she means to say is you were
looking like a Genghis there for a minute.

1012
00:51:09,718 --> 00:51:11,851
[all laugh]

1013
00:51:12,025 --> 00:51:15,159
[Daisy] And then what about Tom?
Was he like a big inventor?

1014
00:51:18,858 --> 00:51:19,858
Mm.

1015
00:51:21,643 --> 00:51:22,643
[sighs] Sorry.

1016
00:51:25,473 --> 00:51:27,258
I shouldn't have.

1017
00:51:31,218 --> 00:51:34,047
Daisy, what did you think
about the green beans tonight?

1018
00:51:35,527 --> 00:51:37,244
- They were very good.
- [Jane] Weren't they?

1019
00:51:37,268 --> 00:51:39,226
Dimitri brought that recipe
over from Russia.

1020
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:42,882
Mom, we put paprika on them.
It's hardly revolutionary.

1021
00:51:43,056 --> 00:51:44,753
[Dimitri]
Well, maybe it is.

1022
00:51:44,927 --> 00:51:46,755
[indistinct conversation]

1023
00:51:46,929 --> 00:51:49,889
[gentle instrumental music]

1024
00:52:19,048 --> 00:52:20,746
We can finish another row today.

1025
00:52:22,356 --> 00:52:23,488
Get ahead on orders.

1026
00:52:24,837 --> 00:52:26,317
Good to see you
enjoying the farm.

1027
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:28,971
Yeah, it's nice.

1028
00:52:30,364 --> 00:52:31,364
[Jeff]
You know,

1029
00:52:32,714 --> 00:52:34,368
I can't run
this place much longer.

1030
00:52:35,195 --> 00:52:37,632
I wanna leave it
in good hands though.

1031
00:52:37,806 --> 00:52:40,679
I, I was thinking
I'd sign it over to you.

1032
00:52:42,028 --> 00:52:43,421
It won't be easy, you know.

1033
00:52:43,595 --> 00:52:45,553
Harder with this weather, but...

1034
00:52:46,598 --> 00:52:48,513
worth it, I think, to...

1035
00:52:49,949 --> 00:52:53,561
you know, work the earth
and be part of it all.

1036
00:52:56,390 --> 00:52:57,913
I'm going to Mars.

1037
00:52:58,827 --> 00:52:59,915
Realistically though.

1038
00:53:00,525 --> 00:53:01,787
I am being realistic.

1039
00:53:04,137 --> 00:53:07,488
Well, you know, I just thought
I would give you a purpose.

1040
00:53:07,662 --> 00:53:09,229
I have a purpose.

1041
00:53:10,491 --> 00:53:12,537
[sighs] I'm not Tom, Dad.

1042
00:53:15,061 --> 00:53:16,628
So you won't even consider it?

1043
00:53:16,802 --> 00:53:19,544
Well, no,
it just doesn't make any sense.

1044
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:23,540
It would be a waste of both of our
times when I'm leaving so soon.

1045
00:53:23,635 --> 00:53:26,681
- You're not actually going, Alex.
- I am going.

1046
00:53:26,855 --> 00:53:29,162
- But I'm giving this to you.
- I don't want it.

1047
00:53:35,734 --> 00:53:37,214
I'm gonna take a break.

1054

Just wanna get your take on

1055
00:54:02,064 --> 00:54:02,891
new reports
the mission's a scam.

1056
00:54:03,065 --> 00:54:04,502
It is not a scam, okay?

1057
00:54:04,676 --> 00:54:06,199
- It's real.
- Look, Alex,

1058
00:54:06,373 --> 00:54:08,413
I just wanna hear your side
of the story, all right?

1059
00:54:08,593 --> 00:54:10,116
Can we set the record straight?

1061
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:25,827
He ever tell you
how he was selected?

1062
00:54:26,567 --> 00:54:28,439
- Mm-mm.
- Skype interviews.

1063
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:30,832
Does that sound legit to you?

1064
00:54:32,225 --> 00:54:35,272
Look, I don't want you spending
too much time on this policy.

1065
00:54:35,968 --> 00:54:37,859
All right, there's lots
of other policies out there

1066
00:54:37,883 --> 00:54:40,973
way more normal
than this particular one.

1067
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:44,780
Why do I have a feeling we're
not talking about policies?

1068
00:54:45,978 --> 00:54:47,298
Look, he's always been
a nice boy.

1069
00:54:47,327 --> 00:54:48,720
He's just never been normal.

1070

I don't know what you got
going with him, but

1071
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:53,159
I don't think
it's the best idea.

1072
00:54:53,899 --> 00:54:54,899

Sorry, Jeff.

1084
00:55:41,468 --> 00:55:42,643
I tried to throw them out,

1085
00:55:42,817 --> 00:55:44,732
but Bert found them
in the dumpster.

1086
00:55:44,906 --> 00:55:45,994

- Out of all of us.
- What...

1092
00:56:08,843 --> 00:56:10,410
Alex, you spoke to reporters?

1093
00:56:10,976 --> 00:56:12,934
You promised
you'd refer them to me.

1094
00:56:13,108 --> 00:56:14,762
I... He said it was a scam.
I had to say...

1095
00:56:14,936 --> 00:56:16,634
You couldn't even
change his mind.

1096
00:56:17,199 --> 00:56:18,916
- It's on the Internet.
- He na... , he named the farm.

1097
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:20,551
He named our clients,
our suppliers.

1098
00:56:20,725 --> 00:56:22,857
Now, everyone can see
this nonsense.

1099
00:56:23,031 --> 00:56:25,270
- Doesn't matter what anyone else thinks.
-[Liz] Yes, it does.

they'll see the truth

- when I head off to training.
- Enough!

1103
00:56:31,649 --> 00:56:32,780
I said enough.

This needs to stop.

- It's his life.
- [Jeff] But it's not real.

1110
00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:50,581
I offered him a real life,

1111
00:56:50,755 --> 00:56:53,192
and, and he, he, he,
he chose this farce.

1112

- Because he's giving up!
- So you're a therapist now.

Why, why... [scoffs]

- [singing]

1549
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:45,629
There was something
in the sky that night.

1550
01:23:45,803 --> 01:23:46,803
[singing in Russian]

1551
01:23:46,934 --> 01:23:48,327
Oh, there was something

1552
01:23:48,501 --> 01:23:50,634
in the air like light.

1553
01:23:51,417 --> 01:23:54,246
[singing in Russian]

1554
01:23:54,420 --> 01:23:58,511
There's a magical spark,
like breaking car parts.

1555
01:23:58,685 --> 01:23:59,947
[chuckles]

1556
01:24:00,122 --> 01:24:01,732
It sounds more romantic
in Russian.

1557
01:24:03,864 --> 01:24:04,864
[sighs]

1558
01:24:04,952 --> 01:24:05,736
Damn it.

1559
01:24:05,910 --> 01:24:07,216
Well, it's not that bad.

1560
01:24:07,390 --> 01:24:08,750
[sighs] No, it,
it just sounds like

1561
01:24:08,869 --> 01:24:11,002
they're singing about fireflies.

1562
01:24:11,611 --> 01:24:14,223
No, it doesn't. We don't
even have them in Russia.

1563
01:24:18,792 --> 01:24:21,230
- Liz?
- What?

1564
01:24:21,404 --> 01:24:23,623
- You know where Daisy works?
- Yeah.

1565
01:24:23,797 --> 01:24:26,844
Okay. I need you
to try and get her here.

1566
01:24:28,106 --> 01:24:29,673
Um, what changed your mind?

1567
01:24:29,847 --> 01:24:32,067
[Dimitri] Oh, Elizabeth,
I would sing it for you,

1568
01:24:32,241 --> 01:24:34,678
but then you will fall in love
with me even more.

1569
01:24:34,852 --> 01:24:37,246
Okay, calm down, Romeo.
Why can't you go?

1570
01:24:37,420 --> 01:24:39,509
I, I gotta do something first.

1571
01:24:40,162 --> 01:24:41,487
Well, what am I supposed
to say to her?

1572
01:24:41,511 --> 01:24:43,339
I don't know. PR something.

1573
01:24:43,513 --> 01:24:45,906
- That's not how that works.
- Liz.

1574
01:24:46,081 --> 01:24:47,734
I'll go. I'll go.

1575
01:24:48,387 --> 01:24:50,302
[slow instrumental music]

1576
01:24:59,224 --> 01:25:01,008
[sighs]

1577
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:04,447
You get one minute.

1578
01:25:04,621 --> 01:25:07,189
Not much of a lunch break
these days.

1579
01:25:08,755 --> 01:25:10,061
I'm sorry.

1580
01:25:11,889 --> 01:25:15,501
You trusted me,
and I used that against you.

1581
01:25:16,633 --> 01:25:19,462
What I said was indefensible.
I, I don't have any excuses.

1582
01:25:19,636 --> 01:25:22,204
It's... I'm just really sorry.

1583
01:25:23,161 --> 01:25:24,249
[sighs]

1584
01:25:26,164 --> 01:25:27,164
Okay.

1585
01:25:29,689 --> 01:25:31,169
Why are we standing in dirt?

1586
01:25:31,996 --> 01:25:33,432
Um, it's a...

1587
01:25:34,607 --> 01:25:35,826
field of daisies.

1588
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:39,786
We only had the seeds.

1589
01:25:40,570 --> 01:25:41,962
And not a whole field free.

1590
01:25:42,137 --> 01:25:44,878
It's a row of daisies.

1591
01:25:45,052 --> 01:25:46,402
It was a, it was a lot of work.

1592
01:25:47,707 --> 01:25:49,013
It's very nice.

1593
01:25:49,796 --> 01:25:51,556
It could have waited
until after work though.

1594
01:25:51,711 --> 01:25:53,670
You're right, and I was wrong.

1595
01:25:55,628 --> 01:25:56,977
Never mind, I like this.

1596
01:25:58,414 --> 01:26:02,592
For me, space is safe
as I can control it.

1597
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:06,117
Even though
it's completely unpredictable

1598
01:26:06,291 --> 01:26:07,771
and ever-expanding into a degree

1599
01:26:07,945 --> 01:26:09,990
where it could all
implode at once.

1600
01:26:10,165 --> 01:26:11,664
But that is not the point.
That, that...

1601
01:26:11,688 --> 01:26:13,820
This is, this...
The point is this.

1602
01:26:16,083 --> 01:26:17,824
And this is terrifying.

1603
01:26:19,609 --> 01:26:20,871
I'm terrified.

1604
01:26:21,959 --> 01:26:23,743
You are terrifying.

1605
01:26:25,397 --> 01:26:27,094
Glad I brought so much
to the table.

1606
01:26:29,532 --> 01:26:30,968
My brother died.

1607
01:26:33,275 --> 01:26:35,581
- I know.
- But I never told you...

1608
01:26:37,931 --> 01:26:39,585
We were driving,

1609
01:26:39,759 --> 01:26:42,327
and there was a deer
in the road, and we swerved.

1610
01:26:43,807 --> 01:26:45,200
I, I swerved.

1611
01:26:47,767 --> 01:26:48,942
[exhales]

1612
01:26:49,116 --> 01:26:50,901
He was really great, Daisy.

1613
01:26:52,511 --> 01:26:54,339
He had my Mom's eyes.

1614
01:26:55,688 --> 01:26:57,081
And, um...

1615
01:26:58,691 --> 01:26:59,953
He was funny.

1616
01:27:00,127 --> 01:27:02,782
And the last thing he did was

1617
01:27:03,348 --> 01:27:05,220
he put his arm out
to protect me.

1618
01:27:06,830 --> 01:27:10,790
Even though we all know
that doesn't do anything.

1619
01:27:11,835 --> 01:27:12,835
[sighs]

1620
01:27:12,923 --> 01:27:13,923
But since then,

1621
01:27:14,011 --> 01:27:16,579
I have been so scared

1622
01:27:16,753 --> 01:27:18,842
of that happening
to anyone else that I love.

1623
01:27:20,104 --> 01:27:21,148
[exhales]

1624
01:27:22,237 --> 01:27:25,805
So, that's how I know that

1625
01:27:25,979 --> 01:27:28,286
this is the real adventure
for me.

1626
01:27:28,460 --> 01:27:30,375
That, that part, that was corny.

1627
01:27:30,549 --> 01:27:31,681
[chuckles]

1628
01:27:31,855 --> 01:27:34,640
But you understand
what I'm saying?

1629
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:37,121
I do.

1630
01:27:37,643 --> 01:27:39,732
[cart pulls over]

1631
01:27:39,906 --> 01:27:41,299
What you got there?

1632
01:27:41,908 --> 01:27:44,041
Uh, daisies.

1633
01:27:44,215 --> 01:27:45,651
Weeds?

1634
01:27:46,565 --> 01:27:48,001
Couldn't exactly do roses.

1635
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:52,528
Oh, actually,
I kind of like daisies.

1636
01:27:53,746 --> 01:27:56,662
But just try to keep them away
from the other plants, okay?

1637
01:27:59,926 --> 01:28:00,926
[Liz]
Dad!

1638
01:28:01,928 --> 01:28:04,148
Go away. Go.

1639
01:28:08,848 --> 01:28:09,936
Forever a weed.

[sighs]

1641
01:28:13,897 --> 01:28:15,246
What about Mars though?

1642
01:28:17,161 --> 01:28:18,684
There's no daisies on Mars.

1643
01:28:20,164 --> 01:28:21,165
Oh, my God.

1644
01:28:21,339 --> 01:28:22,732
Wow.

1645
01:28:22,906 --> 01:28:24,777
Wow. Oh, my God.

1646
01:28:24,951 --> 01:28:28,085
[laughs] Did, did you
rehearse that or something?

1647
01:28:28,259 --> 01:28:31,044
No, I actually came up
with that on the spot.

1648
01:28:31,654 --> 01:28:32,655
I loved it.

1649
01:28:33,351 --> 01:28:34,352
Really?

1650
01:28:34,526 --> 01:28:35,526
Really.

- Whoo!
- [Liz] Go, you.

- Oh, oh, oh!
- Awesome.

This is Mars.

This will be the first colony
on Mars.

1663
01:29:10,301 --> 01:29:13,348
Two hundred and ten days. people
will travel there in this.

1664
01:29:14,523 --> 01:29:16,089
Then this will be their home.
