00:00:19,235 --> 00:00:22,699
<i>Long ago,
the world was full of wonder.</i>

3
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:30,755
<i>It was adventurous...</i>

4
00:00:32,513 --> 00:00:33,696
<i>exciting...</i>

5
00:00:36,123 --> 00:00:38,011
<i>and best of all...</i>

6
00:00:38,326 --> 00:00:39,925
<i>there was magic.</i>

7
00:00:41,562 --> 00:00:43,353
<i>Boombastia!</i>

8
00:00:52,944 --> 00:00:56,239
<i>And that magic
helped all in need.</i>

9
00:00:56,241 --> 00:00:57,776
<i>Flame Infernar!</i>

10
00:01:07,461 --> 00:01:09,189
<i>Voltar Thundasir!</i>

11
00:01:23,552 --> 00:01:27,107
<i>But it wasn't
easy to master.</i>

12
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:29,849
<i>And so the world found
a simpler way to get by.</i>

13
00:01:29,851 --> 00:01:32,597
I call it the light bulb.

14
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,420
'Tis so easy.

15
00:01:41,997 --> 00:01:43,018
Huh.

16
00:01:46,597 --> 00:01:47,780
<i>Over time...</i>

17
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:51,398
<i>...magic faded away.</i>

18
00:02:10,133 --> 00:02:11,284
<i>But I hope...</i>

19
00:02:15,853 --> 00:02:17,965
<i>...there's a little
magic left...</i>

20
00:02:19,188 --> 00:02:20,148
<i>in you.</i>

21
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,549
<i>All right.</i>

22
00:02:41,551 --> 00:02:44,090
<i>We're gonna get
Warrior Z90 fit.</i>

23
00:02:44,092 --> 00:02:46,258
<i>Let me hear you say,
"I'm a mighty warrior."</i>

24
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,797
I'm a mighty warrior.

25
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:48,964
Morning, Mom.

26
00:02:51,749 --> 00:02:53,749
Oh! Blazey, down!

27
00:02:53,751 --> 00:02:56,184
Bad dragon!
Back to your lair.

28
00:02:57,303 --> 00:02:59,854
Happy birthday,
Mr. Adult Man.

29
00:02:59,856 --> 00:03:01,373
No, Mom.

30
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:04,084
Hey, buddy. Don't wipe off
my kisses.

31
00:03:04,086 --> 00:03:05,109
What?

32
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:07,157
You're wearing
your dad's sweatshirt.

33
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:09,708
Oh. You know.
Finally fits.

34
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,043
Aw, my little chubby cheeks
is all grown up!

35
00:03:12,045 --> 00:03:15,148
Okay, okay. Mom, I gotta eat
something before school.

36
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,744
Ah, we don't have
much food.

37
00:03:16,746 --> 00:03:18,297
I still have to go
to the grocery store.

38
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:19,723
Ah, hands off, mister.

39
00:03:19,725 --> 00:03:21,147
Those are
for your party tonight.

40
00:03:21,149 --> 00:03:23,732
It's not a party, Mom.
It's just us.

41
00:03:23,734 --> 00:03:25,584
You could invite those kids
from your science class.

42
00:03:25,586 --> 00:03:27,701
You said they seem
pretty rockin'.

43
00:03:27,703 --> 00:03:29,952
I'm, uh, pretty sure
I didn't say it like that.

44
00:03:29,954 --> 00:03:31,551
And besides,
I don't even know them.

45
00:03:31,553 --> 00:03:33,888
Well, your birthday's a day
to try new things.

46
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,766
Be the new you.

47
00:03:35,768 --> 00:03:36,927
Speaking of
trying new things,

48
00:03:36,929 --> 00:03:39,027
did you sign up
for driving practice?

49
00:03:39,029 --> 00:03:40,530
No!
No.

50
00:03:40,532 --> 00:03:43,145
I know you're a little scared to
drive, sweetie pie, but...

51
00:03:43,147 --> 00:03:46,211
I'm not scared, Mom.
I'm gonna move Barley's game.

52
00:03:46,213 --> 00:03:48,029
Okay, but you know
how he gets when someone

53
00:03:48,031 --> 00:03:49,280
touches that board.

54
00:03:49,282 --> 00:03:52,133
Well, he's gotta learn
how to clean up his toys.

55
00:03:52,135 --> 00:03:53,173
Halt!

56
00:03:53,175 --> 00:03:57,038
Doth my brother dare disrupt
an active campaign?

57
00:03:57,584 --> 00:03:58,443
Oh, come on!

58
00:03:58,445 --> 00:03:59,754
You know, Ian,

59
00:03:59,756 --> 00:04:01,468
in the days of old,
a boy of 16

60
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,557
would have
his strength tested

61
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:04,032
in the Swamps of Despair.

62
00:04:04,034 --> 00:04:06,239
I'm not testing anything.
Just let me go.

63
00:04:06,241 --> 00:04:07,161
Let him go.

64
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:07,795
Okay.

65
00:04:07,797 --> 00:04:09,422
But I know you're
stronger than that.

66
00:04:09,424 --> 00:04:11,051
There's a mighty warrior
inside of you.

67
00:04:11,053 --> 00:04:12,630
You just have to
let him out.

68
00:04:12,632 --> 00:04:14,051
Right, Mom?

69
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:15,307
Oh, that's good.

70
00:04:15,309 --> 00:04:17,257
Barley! You stink!

71
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:18,326
When was the last time
you showered?

72
00:04:18,328 --> 00:04:20,102
If you tried a little
harder, you actually could

73
00:04:20,104 --> 00:04:22,399
probably wiggle out of this.

74
00:04:22,401 --> 00:04:25,721
See? Mom knows how
to let out her inner warrior.

75
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:26,734
Thank you.

76
00:04:26,736 --> 00:04:27,958
Now, take out
the trash.

77
00:04:30,838 --> 00:04:32,467
<i>Stay on the
lookout for a runaway griffin.</i>

78
00:04:32,469 --> 00:04:34,685
Ah, Officer Bronco.

79
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,635
Barley, Barley, Barley.

80
00:04:36,637 --> 00:04:38,847
Every time the city tries
to tear down

81
00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:40,008
an old piece of rubble,

82
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:43,009
I gotta drag my rear end
out here and deal with you.

83
00:04:43,011 --> 00:04:44,883
I don't know
what you're talking about.

84
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:46,305
Oh, really?

85
00:04:46,307 --> 00:04:48,942
<i>I will not let you
tear down this fountain.</i>

86
00:04:48,944 --> 00:04:51,586
<i>Ancient warriors
on grand quests</i>

87
00:04:51,588 --> 00:04:53,569
<i>drank from its
flowing water.</i>

88
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:55,751
Barley.

89
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,603
They're destroying
the town's past.

90
00:04:57,605 --> 00:04:59,090
Ugh. Well,
come on in.

91
00:04:59,092 --> 00:05:00,478
Rest your haunches
for a minute.

92
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,770
Thank you, hon.

93
00:05:02,663 --> 00:05:03,654
Ugh.

94
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,693
Hey there,
birthday boy.

95
00:05:06,695 --> 00:05:09,801
So, ya workin' hard
or hardly workin'?

96
00:05:09,803 --> 00:05:12,149
I'm just, you know,
making toast.

97
00:05:12,151 --> 00:05:13,370
I'm serious, Barley,

98
00:05:13,372 --> 00:05:15,157
you need to start thinking
less about the past

99
00:05:15,159 --> 00:05:17,008
and more about
your future.

100
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,530
Ah, she's right.

101
00:05:20,381 --> 00:05:22,497
You can't spend all day
playing your board game.

102
00:05:24,182 --> 00:05:26,628
<i>Quests of Yore</i>
isn't just a board game.

103
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:30,000
It's a historically-based
role-playing scenario.

104
00:05:30,002 --> 00:05:31,222
Did you know,
in the old days,

105
00:05:31,224 --> 00:05:34,131
centaurs could run
70 miles an hour?

106
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:35,918
I own a vehicle.
Don't need to run.

107
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,371
Well, Ian,
you could definitely

108
00:05:37,373 --> 00:05:38,893
learn a lot
from <i>Quests of Yore.</i>

109
00:05:38,895 --> 00:05:40,280
- You wanna play?
- I don't.

110
00:05:40,282 --> 00:05:41,834
You could be
a crafty rogue or...

111
00:05:41,836 --> 00:05:45,040
Ooh! I know!
You can be a wizard.

112
00:05:45,042 --> 00:05:46,926
I shall cast a spell
on thee!

113
00:05:46,928 --> 00:05:48,280
Hey! Careful of
Dad's sweatshirt!

114
00:05:48,282 --> 00:05:50,594
I don't even remember Dad
wearing that sweatshirt.

115
00:05:50,596 --> 00:05:53,569
Well, you do only have,
like, two memories of him.

116
00:05:53,571 --> 00:05:54,429
No, I've got three.

117
00:05:54,431 --> 00:05:56,148
I remember
his beard was scratchy,

118
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,867
he had a goofy laugh,
and I used to play

119
00:05:57,869 --> 00:05:59,520
- drums on his feet.
- Drums on his feet. Right.

120
00:05:59,522 --> 00:06:00,644
I used to go...

121
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:04,316
- Whoa!
- Five-second rule. Hah!

122
00:06:05,646 --> 00:06:06,700
It's okay.
You just got to pull it.

123
00:06:06,702 --> 00:06:07,926
No!

124
00:06:08,223 --> 00:06:09,215
Barley!

125
00:06:10,108 --> 00:06:11,296
Uh, you know...

126
00:06:11,298 --> 00:06:13,511
I'm just gonna get some
food on the way to school.

127
00:06:13,513 --> 00:06:15,329
I'll sew that
later tonight, okay?

128
00:06:15,331 --> 00:06:16,519
Wait, wait, wait.

129
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:19,462
By the laws of yore,
I must dub thee a man today.

130
00:06:19,464 --> 00:06:20,552
Kneel before me.

131
00:06:20,554 --> 00:06:22,767
Oh! That's okay.
I gotta get going.

132
00:06:22,769 --> 00:06:23,923
All right, well,
I'll pick you up later.

133
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,180
We'll perform
the ceremony at school.

134
00:06:25,182 --> 00:06:26,106
Oh! No, no, no, no.

135
00:06:26,108 --> 00:06:27,926
Don't do that.
Don't do that. Okay, bye!

136
00:06:40,851 --> 00:06:41,908
Hey!

137
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:42,966
Go Griffins!

138
00:06:42,968 --> 00:06:43,825
What?

139
00:06:43,827 --> 00:06:45,247
You go to
Willowdale College?

140
00:06:45,249 --> 00:06:47,328
Oh, no.
This was my dad's.

141
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:50,007
Lightfoot?
Wilden Lightfoot?

142
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:51,064
Yeah.

143
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:52,817
You're kidding.
I went to college with him.

144
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:54,899
- Really?
- Yeah.

145
00:06:54,901 --> 00:06:58,537
Boy, I was so sorry to hear
that he passed away.

146
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,618
Yeah. Thanks.

147
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,685
You know, your dad was
a great guy. So confident.

148
00:07:04,687 --> 00:07:07,858
When he came into a room,
people noticed.

149
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:11,494
The man wore the ugliest
purple socks every single day.

150
00:07:11,496 --> 00:07:12,486
What? Why?

151
00:07:12,488 --> 00:07:14,568
Hey, that's exactly
what we asked.

152
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,287
But he was just bold.

153
00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:19,494
I always wished I had
a little bit of that in me.

154
00:07:19,496 --> 00:07:24,287
Yeah. Wow. I've never heard
any of this about him before.

155
00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:26,304
- What else do you remember?
- Dad!

156
00:07:26,306 --> 00:07:28,950
Oh, sorry. Gotta get
this guy off to school.

157
00:07:28,952 --> 00:07:30,997
Hey, it was nice
meeting you.

158
00:07:30,999 --> 00:07:33,149
Yeah. You, too.

159
00:07:52,795 --> 00:07:53,787
Huh.

160
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:56,365
Bold.

161
00:08:40,273 --> 00:08:42,753
Okay, class.
Sit down. We're starting roll.

162
00:08:49,727 --> 00:08:51,808
Hey, uh, Gorgamon. Um...

163
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:54,783
Would you mind not putting
your feet on my chair today?

164
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:55,676
Sorry, dude.

165
00:08:55,678 --> 00:08:56,900
Got to keep
them elevated.

166
00:08:56,902 --> 00:08:58,618
Gets the blood flowing
to my brain.

167
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,725
It just makes it a little
hard for me to fit in there.

168
00:09:01,727 --> 00:09:03,279
Well, if I don't have
good blood flow,

169
00:09:03,281 --> 00:09:05,297
I can't concentrate
on my schoolwork.

170
00:09:05,299 --> 00:09:07,841
You don't want me to do bad
in school, do you?

171
00:09:07,843 --> 00:09:09,496
Uh...

172
00:09:09,801 --> 00:09:11,222
No.

173
00:09:11,653 --> 00:09:12,809
Thanks, bro.

174
00:09:16,511 --> 00:09:18,064
First road test.

175
00:09:18,066 --> 00:09:19,288
Any volunteers?

176
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,320
A left here.

177
00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:28,981
Now, take this on-ramp
for the freeway.

178
00:09:30,106 --> 00:09:33,047
Okay, yeah. I'm, uh,
super ready for that.

179
00:09:36,619 --> 00:09:37,907
Uh...

180
00:09:39,031 --> 00:09:40,715
It's nice and fast.

181
00:09:40,717 --> 00:09:41,872
Just merge into traffic.

182
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:43,426
Yep. Just any minute.

183
00:09:43,428 --> 00:09:44,517
- Merge into traffic.
- Uh...

184
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:45,575
Merge into traffic!

185
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,253
I'm not ready!

186
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:49,244
Pull over.

187
00:09:53,181 --> 00:09:55,625
All right. So, what should
we do this weekend?

188
00:09:55,627 --> 00:09:56,814
Move to a cooler town?

189
00:09:56,816 --> 00:09:58,103
Oh, hey.
What up, dudes? Um...

190
00:09:58,105 --> 00:10:00,087
I'm, uh, having
a party tonight,

191
00:10:00,089 --> 00:10:02,501
and I was wondering if
you wanted to come over

192
00:10:02,503 --> 00:10:04,714
and get down
on some cake.

193
00:10:04,716 --> 00:10:06,798
That's not
something anyone says.

194
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,982
Okay, don't say "dudes."
"Gang"?

195
00:10:10,469 --> 00:10:12,121
What's up, gang?

196
00:10:12,123 --> 00:10:14,070
What's up, gang?

197
00:10:18,371 --> 00:10:19,657
Hey.
What's up, gang?

198
00:10:19,659 --> 00:10:22,236
Oh, hey.
Uh, Ian, right?

199
00:10:22,238 --> 00:10:24,947
Oh! I didn't know
you knew my...

200
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:26,500
Anyway...

201
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:28,516
uh, if you like parties,
then I'm...

202
00:10:28,518 --> 00:10:29,938
I was gonna
do a party...

203
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,459
- What?
- What I was trying to say is

204
00:10:31,461 --> 00:10:32,848
if you're not doing
anything tonight...

205
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:35,162
but I'm sure you probably
are doing something tonight...

206
00:10:35,164 --> 00:10:37,079
and you like cake
like I like cake,

207
00:10:37,081 --> 00:10:39,591
I've got a cake
at my house.

208
00:10:39,593 --> 00:10:41,938
Are you inviting us
to a party?

209
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,897
That's the one.

210
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:44,913
Oh. Yeah,
we don't have any plans.

211
00:10:44,915 --> 00:10:45,972
- Yeah, okay.
- Totally.

212
00:10:45,974 --> 00:10:47,260
Really?

213
00:10:47,262 --> 00:10:49,013
I guess we can just take
the bus over to my house.

214
00:10:52,221 --> 00:10:53,410
Oh, no, no, no.

215
00:10:53,412 --> 00:10:56,816
Ha-ha! Is that
the birthday boy I see?

216
00:11:00,783 --> 00:11:03,360
Behold!
Your chariot awaits!

217
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:04,847
Do you know that guy?

218
00:11:04,849 --> 00:11:07,492
- Uh...
- Sir Iandore of Lightfoot.

219
00:11:07,494 --> 00:11:09,674
Seems like he's
talking to you.

220
00:11:09,676 --> 00:11:10,765
Hey, Ian!

221
00:11:12,684 --> 00:11:14,136
Hey, Barley.

222
00:11:14,138 --> 00:11:16,054
Yeah, we were actually
gonna take the bus.

223
00:11:16,056 --> 00:11:17,939
The bus? Nay!

224
00:11:17,941 --> 00:11:19,790
I will give you
and your companions

225
00:11:19,792 --> 00:11:21,971
transport upon Guinevere.

226
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:23,757
Um, who's Guinevere?

227
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:25,905
My mighty steed.

228
00:11:25,907 --> 00:11:28,153
Oh. That's embarrassing.

229
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:30,137
That's okay, girl.
Patch you back up.

230
00:11:31,098 --> 00:11:32,946
He's just joking around.

231
00:11:32,948 --> 00:11:35,362
You've got
something on your face.

232
00:11:36,386 --> 00:11:39,923
Oh, no. You... just...
Wait, no. It's... No...

233
00:11:40,685 --> 00:11:41,872
Oh! Uh...

234
00:11:41,874 --> 00:11:42,963
You know what?
I just remembered

235
00:11:42,965 --> 00:11:44,583
that my birthday
is, uh, canceled.

236
00:11:44,585 --> 00:11:45,972
- What?
- I mean, the party.

237
00:11:45,974 --> 00:11:47,558
Uh, it was never
actually happening.

238
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,244
It was just this
huge misunderstanding.

239
00:11:49,246 --> 00:11:50,402
So, I got to go.

240
00:11:50,404 --> 00:11:51,758
Okay. Bye!

241
00:11:58,602 --> 00:12:02,434
Ooh. Whoops! Sorry.
Let me just file those.

242
00:12:03,561 --> 00:12:05,509
Hey, did those kids
write on your face?

243
00:12:05,511 --> 00:12:06,996
Here. I'll get it.

244
00:12:06,998 --> 00:12:09,277
Can we please
just go home?

245
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,220
Okay, well, we'll perform
your birthday ceremony later.

246
00:12:12,222 --> 00:12:13,541
Then you'll be ready
for adulthood

247
00:12:13,543 --> 00:12:15,228
and its gauntlet
of challenges.

248
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,352
You know,
in ancient times,

249
00:12:16,354 --> 00:12:17,508
you celebrated
your day of birth

250
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,964
with a solemn quest.

251
00:12:18,966 --> 00:12:21,508
Of course, those were nothing
compared to the challenges

252
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,032
of the old days.

253
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:28,261
Mom?

254
00:12:29,122 --> 00:12:30,410
Mom?

255
00:13:14,642 --> 00:13:17,185
<i>Will, you're not gonna
get that thing working.</i>

256
00:13:17,187 --> 00:13:18,343
<i>I think I've got it.</i>

257
00:13:18,345 --> 00:13:19,896
<i>I'm gonna watch
from over here</i>

258
00:13:19,898 --> 00:13:21,978
<i>for when it blows up.</i>

259
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,301
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

260
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:24,986
<i>I'll bet good money
you can't get it to work.</i>

261
00:13:24,988 --> 00:13:26,243
<i>Oh, is that right?</i>

262
00:13:26,245 --> 00:13:27,103
<i>Yep.</i>

263
00:13:27,105 --> 00:13:28,293
<i>But you're
doing a good job of</i>

264
00:13:28,295 --> 00:13:29,912
<i>making it look like
you know what you're doing.</i>

265
00:13:29,914 --> 00:13:31,665
<i>Well, I'm trying to.</i>

266
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:33,483
<i>Did you check
if it had batteries?</i>

267
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,796
<i>Of course you didn't.</i>

268
00:13:35,798 --> 00:13:36,855
<i>I know.</i>

269
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:37,978
<i>So, is it really working?</i>

270
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,204
<i>Let's find out.</i>

271
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,464
<i>Okay. Bye.</i>

272
00:13:46,194 --> 00:13:48,605
<i>Will, you're not going
to get that thing working.</i>

273
00:13:48,607 --> 00:13:49,728
<i>I think I've got it.</i>

274
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,447
<i>I'm gonna watch
from over here</i>

275
00:13:51,449 --> 00:13:53,168
<i>for when it blows up.</i>

276
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,357
Hi, Dad.

277
00:13:54,359 --> 00:13:56,043
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

278
00:13:56,045 --> 00:13:57,101
It's me, Ian.

279
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:58,159
<i>Oh, is that right?</i>

280
00:13:58,161 --> 00:14:00,406
Yeah. Did you
have a good day?

281
00:14:00,408 --> 00:14:02,093
<i>Well, I'm trying to.</i>

282
00:14:02,095 --> 00:14:03,679
Yeah. Me, too.

283
00:14:03,681 --> 00:14:06,224
Although, I could clearly use some help.

284
00:14:08,046 --> 00:14:11,182
I sure do wish I could spend
the day with you sometime.

285
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:12,406
<i>I know.</i>

286
00:14:12,408 --> 00:14:14,125
Well, there are so many
things we could do.

287
00:14:14,127 --> 00:14:15,977
I bet it'd be really fun.

288
00:14:15,979 --> 00:14:17,133
<i>Let's find out.</i>

289
00:14:17,135 --> 00:14:19,215
Yeah. I mean, I'd love to.
We could, uh...

290
00:14:19,217 --> 00:14:21,665
<i>Okay. Bye.</i>

291
00:14:23,748 --> 00:14:24,739
Yeah.

292
00:14:25,433 --> 00:14:26,424
Bye.

293
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:33,960
Oh, my...

294
00:14:33,962 --> 00:14:36,671
Barley, keep your soldiers
off my land

295
00:14:36,673 --> 00:14:38,125
or our kingdoms
will go to war!

296
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,009
Sorry, Mom!

297
00:14:40,011 --> 00:14:43,043
Oh, this is the world's
longest gap year.

298
00:14:43,045 --> 00:14:45,026
Honey, I was
gonna do that.

299
00:14:45,028 --> 00:14:46,449
It's okay.

300
00:14:46,451 --> 00:14:49,193
Wow! You must have been taught
by some kind of sewing master.

301
00:14:49,195 --> 00:14:52,534
Yeah. A very humble sewing master.

302
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,200
What was Dad like
when he was my age?

303
00:15:01,202 --> 00:15:03,349
Was he always
super confident?

304
00:15:03,351 --> 00:15:04,373
Oh, no.

305
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:07,417
It took him a while
to find out who he was.

306
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:10,260
I wish I'd met him.

307
00:15:11,218 --> 00:15:13,001
Oh, me, too.

308
00:15:13,003 --> 00:15:17,233
But, hey, you know,
when your dad got sick,

309
00:15:17,235 --> 00:15:18,588
he fought so hard

310
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:21,631
because he wanted to meet you
more than anything.

311
00:15:26,061 --> 00:15:28,838
You know what?
I have something for you.

312
00:15:30,259 --> 00:15:32,803
I was gonna wait
until after cake,

313
00:15:32,805 --> 00:15:35,183
but I think you've waited
long enough.

314
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:36,308
What is it?

315
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,548
It's a gift
from your dad.

316
00:15:44,838 --> 00:15:46,356
What do you mean,
it's from Dad?

317
00:15:46,358 --> 00:15:48,837
I don't know. Mom said
it was for both of us.

318
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:50,059
What is it?

319
00:15:50,061 --> 00:15:54,689
He just said to give you this
when you were both over 16.

320
00:15:55,681 --> 00:15:58,855
I have no idea
what it is.

321
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:07,249
No way!

322
00:16:07,251 --> 00:16:08,770
It's a wizard staff.

323
00:16:08,772 --> 00:16:10,092
- Dad was a wizard.
- What?

324
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,373
Hold on, your dad
was an accountant.

325
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,853
I mean, he got interested
in a lot of strange things

326
00:16:14,855 --> 00:16:16,043
when he got sick, but...

327
00:16:16,045 --> 00:16:17,630
There's a letter.

328
00:16:17,632 --> 00:16:19,150
"Dear Ian and Barley,

329
00:16:19,152 --> 00:16:21,431
"long ago, the world
was full of wonder.

330
00:16:21,433 --> 00:16:23,811
"It was adventurous,
exciting,

331
00:16:23,813 --> 00:16:25,596
"and best of all,
there was magic.

332
00:16:25,598 --> 00:16:27,878
"And that magic
helped all in need.

333
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,398
"But it wasn't easy
to master.

334
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,142
"And so the world found
a simpler way to get by.

335
00:16:32,144 --> 00:16:34,456
"Over time,
magic faded away,

336
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:39,050
"but I hope there's
a little magic left in you.

337
00:16:39,052 --> 00:16:42,193
"And so I wrote this spell,
so I could see for myself

338
00:16:42,887 --> 00:16:45,202
"who my boys
grew up to be."

339
00:16:46,986 --> 00:16:48,607
"Visitation Spell."

340
00:16:51,813 --> 00:16:53,926
I don't believe this.

341
00:16:53,928 --> 00:16:55,810
This spell
brings him back.

342
00:16:55,812 --> 00:16:58,125
For one whole day,
Dad will be back.

343
00:16:58,127 --> 00:16:59,844
- What?
- Back? Like back to life?

344
00:16:59,846 --> 00:17:01,100
That's not possible.

345
00:17:01,102 --> 00:17:02,654
It is with this!

346
00:17:03,688 --> 00:17:05,570
I'm gonna meet Dad?

347
00:17:05,572 --> 00:17:08,612
Oh, Will, you wonderful nut.
What is this?

348
00:17:08,614 --> 00:17:11,190
Now, a spell this powerful
needs an assist element.

349
00:17:11,192 --> 00:17:13,075
And, I mean, for this to work,
Dad would've had to find

350
00:17:13,077 --> 00:17:14,959
a Phoenix Gem!

351
00:17:14,961 --> 00:17:16,183
Wow.

352
00:17:16,185 --> 00:17:17,868
There's only
a few of these left.

353
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,116
Hold on!
Is this dangerous?

354
00:17:20,118 --> 00:17:22,135
We're about to find out.

355
00:17:25,143 --> 00:17:26,199
- Ah!
- What?

356
00:17:26,201 --> 00:17:28,744
Splinter.

357
00:17:28,746 --> 00:17:32,943
"Only once is all we get,
grant me this rebirth.

358
00:17:32,945 --> 00:17:37,605
"Till tomorrow's sun has set,
one day to walk the earth."

359
00:17:41,341 --> 00:17:44,612
Hold on. I was just
grippin' it wrong.

360
00:17:44,614 --> 00:17:47,488
"Only once is all we get,
grant me this rebirth.

361
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:51,489
"Till tomorrow's sun has set,
one day to walk the earth."

362
00:17:52,316 --> 00:17:53,372
"Only once is all we get,

363
00:17:53,374 --> 00:17:54,893
"grant me this rebirth.

364
00:17:54,895 --> 00:17:57,240
"Till tomorrow's sun has set,
one day to walk the earth."

365
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,662
"One day
to walk the earth."

366
00:17:58,664 --> 00:18:02,829
"Till tomorrow's sun has set,
one day to walk the earth."

367
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,380
Barley.

368
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:15,289
I'm sorry you guys
don't have your dad here,

369
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:20,282
but this shows just how much
he wanted to see you both.

370
00:18:20,284 --> 00:18:23,091
So much
that he'd try anything.

371
00:18:23,093 --> 00:18:26,366
That's still
a pretty special gift.

372
00:18:27,192 --> 00:18:28,248
Yeah.

373
00:18:34,069 --> 00:18:38,398
Hey, wanna come with me
to pick up your cake?

374
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,878
That's okay.
Thanks, Mom.

375
00:19:08,562 --> 00:19:13,322
"Only once is all we get,
grant me this rebirth.

376
00:19:18,149 --> 00:19:20,695
"Till tomorrow's sun
has set...

377
00:19:27,306 --> 00:19:30,115
"one day to
walk the earth."

378
00:19:34,479 --> 00:19:35,933
Hey, man,
what are you doing in here?

379
00:19:35,935 --> 00:19:37,982
Holy Tooth of Zadar!
How did you...?

380
00:19:37,984 --> 00:19:39,372
I don't know.
It just started.

381
00:19:46,347 --> 00:19:47,339
Whoa! Feet!

382
00:20:06,546 --> 00:20:08,627
Hang on. I can help!

383
00:20:08,629 --> 00:20:09,818
Barley, no!

384
00:20:33,073 --> 00:20:34,065
Dad?

385
00:20:37,435 --> 00:20:38,692
He's just legs.

386
00:20:40,724 --> 00:20:41,714
There's no top part.

387
00:20:41,716 --> 00:20:43,333
I definitely remember
Dad having a top part!

388
00:20:43,335 --> 00:20:45,748
Oh, what did I do?
This is horrible.

389
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,112
Uh...

390
00:20:55,493 --> 00:20:56,485
Hello?

391
00:20:59,244 --> 00:21:00,630
It's really him.

392
00:21:00,632 --> 00:21:03,340
Dad, you are
in your house.

393
00:21:03,342 --> 00:21:04,334
Whoa, whoa!

394
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,697
He can't hear us.

395
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:17,059
What are you doing?

396
00:21:32,565 --> 00:21:36,665
That's right, Dad.
It's me, Barley.

397
00:21:45,355 --> 00:21:47,404
Yeah, that's Ian.

398
00:21:47,768 --> 00:21:49,817
Hi, Dad.

399
00:21:57,791 --> 00:22:00,303
I messed
this whole thing up.

400
00:22:00,305 --> 00:22:01,789
Now he's gonna be
legs forever.

401
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:04,897
No, not forever.
The spell only lasts one day.

402
00:22:04,899 --> 00:22:06,946
At sunset tomorrow,
he'll disappear,

403
00:22:06,948 --> 00:22:08,998
and we'll never be able
to bring him back again.

404
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,897
Okay, okay, okay.
24 hours.

405
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:14,684
That doesn't give us
much time, but...

406
00:22:19,367 --> 00:22:21,249
Well, we'll just have
to do the spell again.

407
00:22:21,251 --> 00:22:22,638
You mean
you have to.

408
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,381
A person can only do magic
if they have the gift.

409
00:22:25,383 --> 00:22:27,067
And my little brother
has the magic gift.

410
00:22:27,069 --> 00:22:28,984
Okay! Okay.

411
00:22:28,986 --> 00:22:30,572
But I couldn't even
finish the spell.

412
00:22:30,574 --> 00:22:32,886
Well, you're gonna have
plenty of time to practice.

413
00:22:32,888 --> 00:22:35,135
'Cause we have to find
another Phoenix Gem.

414
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:43,564
A-ha! We'll start at the place
where all quests begin.

415
00:22:43,566 --> 00:22:45,330
The Manticore's Tavern.

416
00:22:45,332 --> 00:22:47,182
It's run
by a fearless adventurer.

417
00:22:47,184 --> 00:22:48,701
She knows where to find
any kind of gem,

418
00:22:48,703 --> 00:22:49,793
talisman, totem...

419
00:22:49,795 --> 00:22:51,577
Barley, this is for a game.

420
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:53,264
Based on real life.

421
00:22:53,266 --> 00:22:54,519
How do we know
this tavern

422
00:22:54,521 --> 00:22:55,842
- is still there?
- It's there.

423
00:22:55,844 --> 00:22:57,693
Look, my years of training
have prepared me

424
00:22:57,695 --> 00:22:59,016
for this very moment.

425
00:22:59,018 --> 00:23:01,231
And I'm telling you,
this is the only way

426
00:23:01,233 --> 00:23:04,009
to find a Phoenix Gem.

427
00:23:05,332 --> 00:23:06,786
Trust me.

428
00:23:10,496 --> 00:23:13,734
Whatever it takes,
I am gonna meet my dad.

429
00:23:13,736 --> 00:23:16,910
You hear that, Dad?
We're going on a quest.

430
00:23:19,587 --> 00:23:22,395
Come on, Guinevere.

431
00:23:22,397 --> 00:23:24,449
Uh, maybe we should
just take the bus.

432
00:23:24,451 --> 00:23:26,764
She's fine.

433
00:23:47,616 --> 00:23:49,729
Anyway,
it's just, like,

434
00:23:49,731 --> 00:23:51,977
this award for math.
It's no big deal.

435
00:23:51,979 --> 00:23:54,558
But I'll show you
when we get back home.

436
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,307
Hey, uh,
what are you two

437
00:23:57,309 --> 00:23:58,564
Chatty Charlies up to
back there?

438
00:23:58,566 --> 00:24:00,812
You know, I felt weird
talking to Dad

439
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,962
without a top half, so...

440
00:24:03,307 --> 00:24:04,299
ta-da!

441
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:06,347
Oh, that's great!

442
00:24:06,349 --> 00:24:08,660
Dad, you look
just like I remember.

443
00:24:08,662 --> 00:24:09,718
Hey, don't worry,
we'll have

444
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,040
the rest of you here
before you know it.

445
00:24:11,042 --> 00:24:12,595
And then,
first thing I'm gonna do,

446
00:24:12,597 --> 00:24:14,644
introduce you
to Guinevere.

447
00:24:14,646 --> 00:24:16,794
Rebuilt this
old girl myself,

448
00:24:16,796 --> 00:24:18,974
from the lug nuts
to the air conditioning.

449
00:24:24,034 --> 00:24:25,784
Showing Dad your van?

450
00:24:25,786 --> 00:24:27,966
- That's your whole list?
- What list?

451
00:24:27,968 --> 00:24:29,157
- Oh.
- What's that?

452
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:30,974
I'm just working
on a list of things

453
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,231
I wanted to do with Dad.

454
00:24:32,233 --> 00:24:33,090
You know,

455
00:24:33,092 --> 00:24:36,032
play catch, take a walk,
driving lesson,

456
00:24:36,034 --> 00:24:38,313
share my whole life story
with him.

457
00:24:38,315 --> 00:24:39,504
That's cool.

458
00:24:39,506 --> 00:24:42,579
Oh. But before you cast Dad's
spell again, you're gonna

459
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:44,891
have to practice your magic.

460
00:24:44,893 --> 00:24:47,008
This book is for a game.

461
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:49,066
I told you,
everything in <i>Quests of Yore</i>

462
00:24:49,068 --> 00:24:50,720
is historically
accurate.

463
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:51,996
Even the spells.

464
00:24:51,998 --> 00:24:55,102
So start practicing,
young sorcerer.

465
00:24:55,104 --> 00:24:59,435
Okay, Dad.
Let's try some magic.

466
00:25:03,733 --> 00:25:05,086
Hey, sweetie?

467
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:08,524
Ugh! Blazey. Oh, this dragon
is always under my feet.

468
00:25:08,526 --> 00:25:10,972
Honey, you want some cake?

469
00:25:47,332 --> 00:25:51,065
<i>Aloft Elevar.
Aloft Elevar.</i>

470
00:25:51,067 --> 00:25:53,247
I can't get this
levitation spell to work.

471
00:25:53,249 --> 00:25:55,098
Maybe I could try
something else

472
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,851
like Arcane Lightning?

473
00:25:56,853 --> 00:25:58,504
Yeah, like a level-one mage
could bust out

474
00:25:58,506 --> 00:26:00,190
the hardest spell in
the <i>Enchanter's Guide Book.</i>

475
00:26:00,192 --> 00:26:01,843
Maybe we'll
stick with the easy ones.

476
00:26:01,845 --> 00:26:04,340
Yeah, well, it's not working.
Am I saying it wrong?

477
00:26:04,342 --> 00:26:06,360
Well, mmm,
you said it right.

478
00:26:06,362 --> 00:26:07,748
It's just,
for any spell to work,

479
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,732
you have to speak
from your heart's fire.

480
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,516
- My what?
- Your heart's fire.

481
00:26:11,518 --> 00:26:14,725
You must speak with passion.
Don't hold back.

482
00:26:15,551 --> 00:26:16,707
<i>Aloft Elevar!</i>

483
00:26:16,709 --> 00:26:19,848
No, like <i>Aloft Elevar.</i>

484
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:20,806
<i>Aloft Elevar!</i>

485
00:26:20,808 --> 00:26:23,187
No, from
your heart's fire!

486
00:26:23,189 --> 00:26:25,533
- <i>Aloft Elevar!</i>
- Don't hold back.

487
00:26:25,535 --> 00:26:27,253
- <i>Aloft Elevar!</i>
- Heart's fire!

488
00:26:27,255 --> 00:26:28,707
Stop saying
"heart's fire."

489
00:26:28,709 --> 00:26:31,817
This just clearly
isn't working.

490
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:36,186
Hey, it was
a good start.

491
00:26:41,921 --> 00:26:45,588
Oh. Gather your courage, men.
We've arrived.

492
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:48,431
The Manticore's Tavern.

493
00:26:48,433 --> 00:26:50,415
Huh. It is still here.

494
00:26:50,417 --> 00:26:51,804
Yeah, I told you.

495
00:26:57,663 --> 00:27:00,870
Come on, Dad.
That's good.

496
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,703
All right, listen.
First, let me do the talking.

497
00:27:04,705 --> 00:27:06,521
Secondly,
it's crucial we show

498
00:27:06,523 --> 00:27:08,042
the Manticore
the respect she deserves,

499
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:10,819
or she will, thirdly,
not give us a map to the Phoenix Gem.

500
00:27:10,821 --> 00:27:12,439
Wait, wait, wait.
The map?

501
00:27:12,441 --> 00:27:13,992
I thought she had
a Phoenix Gem.

502
00:27:13,994 --> 00:27:16,372
You're so cute.
Hear that, Dad?

503
00:27:16,374 --> 00:27:18,653
He's a smart kid,
he just doesn't know how quests work.

504
00:27:18,655 --> 00:27:21,629
Well, is there anything else
you're forgetting to tell me?

505
00:27:21,631 --> 00:27:23,032
Mmm. No.

506
00:27:23,034 --> 00:27:24,154
<i>♪ Happy happy birthday</i>

507
00:27:24,156 --> 00:27:25,445
<i>♪ Come join us on a quest</i>

508
00:27:25,447 --> 00:27:27,958
<i>♪ To make your birthday party
The very, very best</i>

509
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,049
<i>♪ Hey!</i>

510
00:27:29,051 --> 00:27:30,899
Okay, okay,
so the tavern

511
00:27:30,901 --> 00:27:32,088
changed a little
over the years,

512
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:35,593
but the Manticore
is still the real deal.

513
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,503
I'll have the soup
of the day.

514
00:27:38,505 --> 00:27:40,653
Would my lord like
a cup or cauldron?

515
00:27:44,006 --> 00:27:47,673
Madam, I request an
audience with the Manticore.

516
00:27:47,675 --> 00:27:49,690
But of course, milord.

517
00:27:51,114 --> 00:27:53,194
Oh, Manticore!

518
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:59,681
No. No, no, no.
The real Manticore.

519
00:27:59,683 --> 00:28:01,896
The fearless adventurer.

520
00:28:01,898 --> 00:28:04,014
Oh. You mean Corey?
She's over there.

521
00:28:05,303 --> 00:28:06,755
Quick!
Somebody help me.

522
00:28:06,757 --> 00:28:08,507
These griffin nuggets were
supposed to go out

523
00:28:08,509 --> 00:28:10,855
minutes ago.

524
00:28:10,857 --> 00:28:13,070
That's the Manticore?

525
00:28:13,072 --> 00:28:15,317
Oh, great and powerful
Manticore.

526
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:17,117
Whoa! Sir, you're right
in the hot zone.

527
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:18,505
You're late, Adolphus.

528
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:22,440
I understand there's traffic.
You need to plan for that.

529
00:28:23,632 --> 00:28:26,737
Well, maybe your mother should
get her own car!

530
00:28:26,739 --> 00:28:28,224
Your fearlessness?

531
00:28:28,226 --> 00:28:30,770
My brother and I seek a map
to a Phoenix Gem.

532
00:28:30,772 --> 00:28:34,009
Oh! Well, you've come to
the right tavern. Table 12.

533
00:28:34,011 --> 00:28:38,174
I have the parchment you
desire right here. Behold!

534
00:28:38,176 --> 00:28:40,621
Oh. That's
a children's menu.

535
00:28:40,623 --> 00:28:43,564
Isn't that fun? They're all
based on my old maps.

536
00:28:43,566 --> 00:28:44,622
Uh, now...

537
00:28:44,624 --> 00:28:45,943
The great Manticore
sends you

538
00:28:45,945 --> 00:28:47,363
on your adventure
with a hero's blessing.

539
00:28:47,365 --> 00:28:48,643
And here's some crayons.

540
00:28:48,645 --> 00:28:51,321
That's very amusing,
your dominance,

541
00:28:51,323 --> 00:28:53,304
but might you have
the real map?

542
00:28:53,306 --> 00:28:55,422
Uh, yeah.
It's, uh, over there.

543
00:28:56,876 --> 00:28:58,593
That's it.

544
00:28:58,595 --> 00:29:00,544
- This is perfect.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

545
00:29:00,546 --> 00:29:02,991
What are you doing?
You can't take this.

546
00:29:02,993 --> 00:29:04,413
We have to.

547
00:29:04,601 --> 00:29:05,856
What is that?

548
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:08,962
It's our dad. And we have
a chance to meet him, but...

549
00:29:08,964 --> 00:29:11,343
But we can't do that
without a Phoenix Gem.

550
00:29:11,345 --> 00:29:15,110
No! My days of sending people
on dangerous quests are over.

551
00:29:15,112 --> 00:29:16,003
What? Why?

552
00:29:16,005 --> 00:29:17,326
'Cause they're dangerous.

553
00:29:17,328 --> 00:29:20,202
Corey, the karaoke
machine's broken again.

554
00:29:20,204 --> 00:29:24,072
I'm sorry,
but you are not getting this map.

555
00:29:24,509 --> 00:29:25,829
Don't worry, ladies,

556
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:27,779
your adventure will continue
momentarily.

557
00:29:27,781 --> 00:29:29,498
Okay,
I can handle this.

558
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,318
No, Ian.

559
00:29:32,673 --> 00:29:34,986
Miss mighty Manticore,
ma'am...

560
00:29:34,988 --> 00:29:36,210
What are you doing?

561
00:29:36,212 --> 00:29:37,829
Kid, this is not
a good time.

562
00:29:37,831 --> 00:29:40,303
Ugh. I'm giving this place
a one-star review.

563
00:29:40,305 --> 00:29:42,471
It's just,
I've never met my dad and...

564
00:29:42,473 --> 00:29:43,661
Look,
I'm sorry about that.

565
00:29:43,663 --> 00:29:45,513
But if you get hurt
on one of my quests,

566
00:29:45,515 --> 00:29:48,026
guess who gets sued
and loses her tavern?

567
00:29:48,028 --> 00:29:49,612
I can't take
that kind of risk.

568
00:29:49,614 --> 00:29:52,720
Now, if you'll just excuse me,
I have important things to do.

569
00:29:52,722 --> 00:29:54,239
Testing.

570
00:29:54,241 --> 00:29:56,256
<i>♪ You haunt my dreams</i>

571
00:29:56,258 --> 00:29:57,546
<i>♪ My inbetweens</i>

572
00:29:57,548 --> 00:29:59,742
Please,
we need that map.

573
00:29:59,744 --> 00:30:01,064
No, I am not
giving you the map.

574
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:02,949
That's it!
I am done talking.

575
00:30:02,951 --> 00:30:05,627
- Well, I'm not!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

576
00:30:05,629 --> 00:30:07,907
You say you can't risk
losing this place.

577
00:30:07,909 --> 00:30:09,065
Look at that Manticore.

578
00:30:09,067 --> 00:30:11,477
She looks like
she lived to take risks.

579
00:30:11,479 --> 00:30:14,023
That Manticore didn't have
investors to look out for.

580
00:30:14,025 --> 00:30:15,675
She didn't have
payroll to cover.

581
00:30:15,677 --> 00:30:17,627
She could just
fly out the door

582
00:30:17,629 --> 00:30:19,148
whenever she wanted
and slay a magma beast.

583
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,362
Are you gonna fix
the machine or not?

584
00:30:21,364 --> 00:30:22,519
Yeah, in a minute.

585
00:30:22,521 --> 00:30:24,337
Okay, maybe
this place isn't

586
00:30:24,339 --> 00:30:26,122
as adventurous
as it used to be.

587
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:27,973
So it isn't filled
with a motley horde

588
00:30:27,975 --> 00:30:29,725
willing to risk
life and limb

589
00:30:29,727 --> 00:30:31,808
for the mere taste
of excitement.

590
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:33,350
But so what?

591
00:30:33,352 --> 00:30:35,135
Who ever said you have to
take risks in life

592
00:30:35,137 --> 00:30:36,689
to have an adventure?

593
00:30:36,691 --> 00:30:39,270
Apparently, you did.

594
00:30:43,667 --> 00:30:46,741
Table 32 said their
mozzarella sticks are cold.

595
00:30:47,832 --> 00:30:49,582
What have I done?

596
00:30:49,584 --> 00:30:50,838
Well, it's not too late.

597
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,061
I mean, you could just
give us the map.

598
00:30:52,063 --> 00:30:53,284
This place
used to be dangerous.

599
00:30:53,286 --> 00:30:54,409
Dangerous!

600
00:30:54,411 --> 00:30:55,994
- And wild!
- Wild!

601
00:30:55,996 --> 00:30:58,871
I used to be
dangerous and wild!

602
00:30:58,873 --> 00:31:02,046
Dangerous and wild!

603
00:31:05,881 --> 00:31:07,764
Wow.

604
00:31:07,766 --> 00:31:11,568
I'm living a lie!
What have I become?

605
00:31:13,301 --> 00:31:14,456
Oh, no.

606
00:31:16,276 --> 00:31:17,795
Everybody out!

607
00:31:17,797 --> 00:31:21,497
This tavern is closed
for remodeling.

608
00:31:31,134 --> 00:31:34,340
Sorry, the karaoke machine
is broken!

609
00:31:39,662 --> 00:31:40,654
Oh.

610
00:31:42,969 --> 00:31:45,313
No! No, no, no!

611
00:31:45,315 --> 00:31:46,371
No.

612
00:31:46,373 --> 00:31:47,365
We gotta go!

613
00:31:56,768 --> 00:31:58,123
<i>Aloft Elevar!</i>

614
00:32:08,771 --> 00:32:11,381
That was unbelievable.

615
00:32:11,383 --> 00:32:13,099
I mean, you were just like...

616
00:32:13,101 --> 00:32:14,819
and the beam
was just floating there!

617
00:32:14,821 --> 00:32:16,736
My brother is a wizard.

618
00:32:16,738 --> 00:32:18,720
I can't believe
that worked.

619
00:32:18,722 --> 00:32:21,100
Oh! You're gonna nail
Dad's spell now.

620
00:32:21,102 --> 00:32:23,200
Except we don't
have a map.

621
00:32:23,202 --> 00:32:26,374
But we've got this. Behold!

622
00:32:27,401 --> 00:32:29,747
Look, on a quest, you have
to use what you've got.

623
00:32:29,749 --> 00:32:31,233
And this is
what we've got.

624
00:32:31,235 --> 00:32:34,705
Best part is, little Kayla
already solved the puzzle.

625
00:32:34,707 --> 00:32:36,523
Well, according to Kayla,

626
00:32:36,525 --> 00:32:39,236
we just have to look
for Raven's Point.

627
00:32:41,351 --> 00:32:43,730
Raven's Point.
Raven's Point.

628
00:32:43,732 --> 00:32:45,911
Yes! The gem must be
in the mountain.

629
00:32:45,913 --> 00:32:47,400
We could be there
by tomorrow morning.

630
00:32:47,402 --> 00:32:48,391
Tomorrow morning?

631
00:32:48,393 --> 00:32:50,641
That still gives us
plenty of time with Dad.

632
00:32:53,406 --> 00:32:55,585
Yeah. Well, it looks like

633
00:32:55,587 --> 00:32:57,571
the expressway should
take us right there.

634
00:32:59,357 --> 00:33:01,834
Mmm. Expressway is
a little too obvious.

635
00:33:01,836 --> 00:33:04,611
On a quest, the clear path
is never the right one.

636
00:33:04,613 --> 00:33:05,536
What?

637
00:33:05,538 --> 00:33:06,958
During one <i>Quests
of Yore</i> campaign,

638
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,908
Shrub Rosehammer and I
took the easy route,

639
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:11,917
led him straight into the
belly of a gelatinous cube.

640
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,033
Only reason I didn't
suffer the same fate?

641
00:33:14,035 --> 00:33:15,355
I followed my gut.

642
00:33:15,357 --> 00:33:19,321
And it's telling me
we take an ancient trail

643
00:33:19,323 --> 00:33:21,146
called the Path of Peril.

644
00:33:21,148 --> 00:33:23,065
But the expressway
is faster.

645
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:24,420
Maybe not in the long run.

646
00:33:24,422 --> 00:33:25,875
I know you
want this to be

647
00:33:25,877 --> 00:33:27,759
like one of
your adventure games,

648
00:33:27,761 --> 00:33:28,982
but all that matters

649
00:33:28,984 --> 00:33:30,734
is that we get to spend
as much time

650
00:33:30,736 --> 00:33:32,421
as possible with Dad.

651
00:33:36,219 --> 00:33:40,021
So, we should just take
the expressway, right?

652
00:33:41,178 --> 00:33:43,555
Yeah, you're right.

653
00:33:43,557 --> 00:33:45,837
But if you end up
inside a gelatinous cube,

654
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:48,415
you are on your own.

655
00:34:01,146 --> 00:34:02,796
<i>Manticore's Tavern</i>

656
00:34:02,798 --> 00:34:04,250
<i>ahead on your right.</i>

657
00:34:06,765 --> 00:34:08,449
- Hey.
- <i>I'm just checking in.</i>

658
00:34:08,451 --> 00:34:09,904
<i>Did you catch up
to the boys yet?</i>

659
00:34:09,906 --> 00:34:10,961
No, not yet.

660
00:34:10,963 --> 00:34:12,515
But I'm a little worried
because we had

661
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:14,664
a weird family issue
come up,

662
00:34:14,666 --> 00:34:17,745
and, well, this just isn't
like Ian to run off.

663
00:34:17,747 --> 00:34:19,472
I mean, Barley, yes,
but not Ian.

664
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,529
You know, it's late,

665
00:34:20,531 --> 00:34:22,413
you shouldn't have to
be out looking for 'em.

666
00:34:22,415 --> 00:34:23,867
I know, it's silly.

667
00:34:23,869 --> 00:34:26,149
I'm sure they're both
probably on fire.

668
00:34:26,151 --> 00:34:28,793
- <i>Fire?</i>
- Fire! The place is on fire!

669
00:34:28,795 --> 00:34:30,942
- My boys! I gotta go!
- <i>Laurel!</i>

670
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:32,603
Get it off, get it off,
get it off!

671
00:34:32,605 --> 00:34:33,759
Excuse me. Hello?

672
00:34:33,761 --> 00:34:36,007
Please, I'm looking for
two teenage elves.

673
00:34:36,009 --> 00:34:38,751
I told you already,
there were two teenage elves.

674
00:34:38,753 --> 00:34:41,066
Oh! Those are my sons.
Where did they go?

675
00:34:41,068 --> 00:34:43,446
Oh. They went on a quest
to find a Phoenix Gem.

676
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:44,768
But don't worry,
don't worry.

677
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:46,619
I told them about the map,
I told them about the gem,

678
00:34:46,621 --> 00:34:47,875
I told them
about the curse.

679
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:49,561
I forgot to
tell them about the curse.

680
00:34:49,563 --> 00:34:50,632
- The what?
- Oh, boy.

681
00:34:50,634 --> 00:34:52,517
Listen, this one's gone
a little...

682
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:55,592
Your boys are in grave danger!
But I can help!

683
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:56,915
Whoa, hey, hey!

684
00:34:56,917 --> 00:35:00,220
You're not going anywhere.
We got questions for you.

685
00:35:00,222 --> 00:35:03,261
I know where they're going!
We can still save them!

686
00:35:03,263 --> 00:35:05,114
Okay, I think
everything's good here.

687
00:35:07,429 --> 00:35:09,807
Last name "Manticore",
first name "The".

688
00:35:09,809 --> 00:35:12,617
Hold on, you're right.
She has gone a little...

689
00:35:12,619 --> 00:35:15,727
It's no wonder with
a wound like that.

690
00:35:16,185 --> 00:35:17,473
That's just a scratch.

691
00:35:17,475 --> 00:35:19,786
Oh, I'm sorry, are you
an expert on minotaurs?

692
00:35:19,788 --> 00:35:21,175
- Manticores.
- Manticores?

693
00:35:21,177 --> 00:35:22,233
Well, no...

694
00:35:22,235 --> 00:35:23,390
Well, then
you wouldn't know

695
00:35:23,392 --> 00:35:25,242
that when their blood
is exposed to air,

696
00:35:25,244 --> 00:35:26,497
it makes them go bonkers.

697
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:27,786
I don't think
that's true.

698
00:35:27,788 --> 00:35:29,903
See? She's already losing
her grip on reality.

699
00:35:29,905 --> 00:35:31,555
So, why don't you let me
save her life

700
00:35:31,557 --> 00:35:33,142
before it costs you yours?

701
00:35:33,144 --> 00:35:34,662
- Okay.
- Thank you.

702
00:35:34,664 --> 00:35:37,209
Could we have a little privacy
here, please?

703
00:35:37,211 --> 00:35:38,629
Just lie back.
That's good.

704
00:35:38,631 --> 00:35:40,414
But get your head
a little bit higher.

705
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:42,929
Just don't take too long
back there, okay?

706
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:44,878
Hey, you hear me?

707
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,126
I said don't take
too long back there,

708
00:35:47,128 --> 00:35:48,548
because...

709
00:35:50,811 --> 00:35:53,123
All right,
how do we help my boys?

710
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:56,098
Ooh! I'm gonna like you.

711
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,512
Radio,
headlights, brakes,

712
00:35:58,514 --> 00:35:59,868
tires, rims.

713
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:01,288
I mean, it's hard
to tell now, Dad,

714
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:02,445
before I replaced
her parts,

715
00:36:02,447 --> 00:36:04,365
Guinevere was actually
kind of a piece of junk.

716
00:36:09,059 --> 00:36:11,571
Looks like we're not gonna get
to do everything today, Dad.

717
00:36:13,125 --> 00:36:14,183
That's okay.

718
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:16,306
I just wanna meet you.

719
00:36:19,751 --> 00:36:22,361
But don't worry, we'll,
uh, have you fixed up

720
00:36:22,363 --> 00:36:24,080
and back home to see...

721
00:36:24,082 --> 00:36:25,501
Oh, man. Mom!

722
00:36:25,503 --> 00:36:26,857
Barley, we're not
gonna be able

723
00:36:26,859 --> 00:36:28,921
to get Dad back in time
to see Mom.

724
00:36:28,923 --> 00:36:30,309
Oh.

725
00:36:30,311 --> 00:36:32,788
Well, Dad, at least you won't
have to meet the new guy.

726
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:36,160
So,
you workin' hard or hardly workin'?

727
00:36:37,584 --> 00:36:38,441
Yeah.

728
00:36:38,443 --> 00:36:40,094
Barley, Barley, Barley.

729
00:36:40,096 --> 00:36:42,077
Every time there's trouble,
I gotta deal with you.

730
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:43,367
Is that your Colt?

731
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:44,226
Yeah.

732
00:36:44,228 --> 00:36:45,780
You're gonna
wanna work on that.

733
00:36:45,782 --> 00:36:48,229
No, no, no!
Come on, old girl.

734
00:36:55,111 --> 00:36:56,894
I thought you
said you fixed the van.

735
00:36:56,896 --> 00:36:58,845
Relax. Guinevere is fine.

736
00:36:58,847 --> 00:37:00,134
Her stomach
is just a little empty.

737
00:37:00,136 --> 00:37:01,689
But it says
we have a full tank.

738
00:37:01,691 --> 00:37:04,037
No. That doesn't work.

739
00:37:09,855 --> 00:37:12,369
Oh. Only a few drops left.

740
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:15,515
Maybe if
there's a gas station...

741
00:37:20,442 --> 00:37:21,761
Hmm.

742
00:37:28,027 --> 00:37:30,437
Is there a magic way
to get gas?

743
00:37:30,439 --> 00:37:34,175
Oh!
I like your thinking, young mage.

744
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:37,644
Growth spell!

745
00:37:37,646 --> 00:37:39,892
We grow the can,
and then the gas inside

746
00:37:39,894 --> 00:37:41,048
will grow with it.

747
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,727
Uh, that's kind of
a weird idea.

748
00:37:43,729 --> 00:37:45,611
I know!
I like it, too.

749
00:37:45,613 --> 00:37:46,868
Okay.

750
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:49,280
Loosen up. Heart's fire.
Here we go.

751
00:37:49,282 --> 00:37:52,057
Whoa. It's not
that simple.

752
00:37:52,059 --> 00:37:53,313
This one learns
a little magic,

753
00:37:53,315 --> 00:37:54,901
thinks he's Shamblefoot
the Wondrous,

754
00:37:54,903 --> 00:37:56,355
am I right, Dad?

755
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:58,569
A growth spell is a
bit more advanced.

756
00:37:58,571 --> 00:38:00,982
Not only do you have to
speak from your heart's fire,

757
00:38:00,984 --> 00:38:03,463
but now you also have to
follow a magic decree.

758
00:38:03,465 --> 00:38:04,619
A magic what?

759
00:38:04,621 --> 00:38:07,661
It's a special rule that keeps
the spell working right.

760
00:38:07,663 --> 00:38:09,743
This one states,
"To magnify an object,

761
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:13,081
"you have to magnify
your attention upon it."

762
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:14,999
While you cast
the spell,

763
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:17,479
you can't let anything
distract you.

764
00:38:17,481 --> 00:38:18,603
Okay.

765
00:38:18,605 --> 00:38:19,661
Ow!

766
00:38:19,663 --> 00:38:20,751
- What?
- Splinter.

767
00:38:20,753 --> 00:38:22,041
Can we sand
this thing down?

768
00:38:22,043 --> 00:38:23,496
No. It's an ancient staff

769
00:38:23,498 --> 00:38:25,346
with magic
in every glorious fiber.

770
00:38:25,348 --> 00:38:26,668
You can't sand it down.

771
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:30,801
All right. All right.
Here we go. Focus.

772
00:38:30,803 --> 00:38:33,314
- Uh...
- Something wrong?

773
00:38:33,316 --> 00:38:35,726
Sorry, it's just,
your stance is, uh... Here.

774
00:38:35,728 --> 00:38:37,677
Chin up, elbows out,
feet apart,

775
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:39,330
back slightly arched.

776
00:38:39,332 --> 00:38:41,016
- Okay, how's that feel?
- Great.

777
00:38:41,018 --> 00:38:42,933
- Oh, one more thing...
- Barley!

778
00:38:42,935 --> 00:38:44,059
Okay, okay.

779
00:38:47,596 --> 00:38:50,241
<i>Magnora Gantuan!</i>

780
00:38:53,151 --> 00:38:54,635
Don't let the magic
spook you.

781
00:38:54,637 --> 00:38:55,629
Okay.

782
00:38:56,463 --> 00:38:57,817
- Elbows!
- What?

783
00:38:57,819 --> 00:38:58,841
Elbows up!

784
00:38:58,843 --> 00:39:00,295
No, no, no, it's too high.
That's too high.

785
00:39:00,297 --> 00:39:01,651
I'm trying to focus here.

786
00:39:01,653 --> 00:39:03,636
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Focus. Focus on the can.

787
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:06,147
Focus.

788
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:08,792
Focus.

789
00:39:08,794 --> 00:39:10,578
Barley! Ah!
Forget it!

790
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:14,882
It worked!

791
00:39:14,884 --> 00:39:16,603
The can is huge.

792
00:39:17,065 --> 00:39:18,882
And the van is huge.

793
00:39:18,884 --> 00:39:19,972
And you're...

794
00:39:19,974 --> 00:39:21,162
Oh, no.

795
00:39:21,164 --> 00:39:22,816
- What happened?
- Looks like you shrunk me.

796
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:24,171
How?

797
00:39:24,173 --> 00:39:26,054
Well, if you mess up a spell,
there are consequences.

798
00:39:26,056 --> 00:39:28,138
I only messed up because you
wouldn't stop bothering me.

799
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,494
I was trying
to help you.

800
00:39:29,496 --> 00:39:30,684
Well, don't try
to help me.

801
00:39:30,686 --> 00:39:32,799
Oh, okay. Fine.
I won't!

802
00:39:32,801 --> 00:39:35,247
Whoa, whoa. Dad, it's me.

803
00:39:36,669 --> 00:39:38,353
Whoa! Dad, it's okay.
Don't worry.

804
00:39:38,355 --> 00:39:39,446
I'm gonna fix this.

805
00:39:40,867 --> 00:39:41,922
Well, where are you going?

806
00:39:41,924 --> 00:39:43,245
To find a gas station.

807
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:45,030
- Well, I'm going, too.
- Fine.

808
00:39:45,032 --> 00:39:46,487
Hey, I don't
need your help.

809
00:39:46,883 --> 00:39:48,503
Fine with me.

810
00:39:51,247 --> 00:39:52,470
Oh.

811
00:40:03,545 --> 00:40:04,798
I just need
a little break.

812
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,818
My baby legs
can't go that fast.

813
00:40:09,297 --> 00:40:11,575
Look, a gas station.

814
00:40:11,577 --> 00:40:12,732
Good.

815
00:40:12,734 --> 00:40:15,378
Oh, wait, I forgot.

816
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,559
You don't need my help.

817
00:40:17,561 --> 00:40:21,131
Hey, I don't need you to carry me.
I'm a grown man.

818
00:40:22,884 --> 00:40:24,403
Dad!

819
00:40:24,405 --> 00:40:27,014
Come on, it's okay.
Barley is with me.

820
00:40:27,016 --> 00:40:28,171
Yeah, I'm fine, Dad.

821
00:40:28,173 --> 00:40:30,221
The side effects are supposed
to wear off eventually.

822
00:40:30,223 --> 00:40:31,377
Do I look
any bigger yet?

823
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:50,981
Hey! Did you
just bump into me?

824
00:40:50,983 --> 00:40:52,998
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
I didn't see you there.

825
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,105
Do it again,
and you'll see me in your nightmares.

826
00:41:10,453 --> 00:41:12,435
This one's lucky.
I know it.

827
00:41:12,437 --> 00:41:16,270
Give me a bag of extra-sours.
Keep the change.

828
00:41:16,272 --> 00:41:18,387
Outta the way,
beanstalk.

829
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:22,087
Uh, 10 on pump two,
please.

830
00:41:23,941 --> 00:41:26,749
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting us food.

831
00:41:26,751 --> 00:41:28,203
All right, I got it.

832
00:41:28,205 --> 00:41:30,386
And a couple of these.
Thank you.

833
00:41:30,388 --> 00:41:32,700
Psst. I have to
go to the bathroom.

834
00:41:32,702 --> 00:41:33,758
Can it wait?

835
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,477
It's your pocket.

836
00:41:35,479 --> 00:41:38,088
Can we have the bathroom
key, please?

837
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:40,071
Okay, be quick.
I want to get out of here.

838
00:41:40,073 --> 00:41:42,235
Okay, I'm goin'.

839
00:41:42,237 --> 00:41:44,088
That'll be 12.99.

840
00:41:44,749 --> 00:41:46,268
Hey, watch it!

841
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,220
You got a problem, Shades?

842
00:41:49,932 --> 00:41:51,847
Answer me
when I'm talking to you.

843
00:41:51,849 --> 00:41:53,831
I'm sorry,
I don't really know

844
00:41:53,833 --> 00:41:55,451
where his head's
at right now.

845
00:41:55,453 --> 00:41:57,238
How could this night
get any worse?

846
00:41:59,222 --> 00:42:02,062
You know, I would
fly us to help your boys,

847
00:42:02,064 --> 00:42:04,673
but the old wings aren't
what they used to be.

848
00:42:04,675 --> 00:42:07,055
Oh, that's fine.
So, about this curse...

849
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:08,245
It's my own fault.

850
00:42:08,247 --> 00:42:09,731
I should be doing
my wing exercises

851
00:42:09,733 --> 00:42:11,385
every morning,
but you know how that goes.

852
00:42:11,387 --> 00:42:13,566
Please, the curse.
What does it do?

853
00:42:13,568 --> 00:42:17,368
Right. Sorry.
It's a Guardian Curse.

854
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:20,740
If your boys take the gem,
the curse will rise up

855
00:42:20,742 --> 00:42:23,220
and assume the form
of a mighty beast,

856
00:42:23,222 --> 00:42:25,171
and battle
your sons to the...

857
00:42:25,173 --> 00:42:27,782
Ooh. Well, how do
your boys do in a crisis?

858
00:42:27,784 --> 00:42:29,665
Not great. One of them
is afraid of everything,

859
00:42:29,667 --> 00:42:31,549
and the other
isn't afraid of anything.

860
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:34,492
Yeah, that skinny kid
of yours is pretty fearless.

861
00:42:34,494 --> 00:42:36,343
No, no. You mean
the big one, Barley.

862
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:39,285
No, no, the little guy.
Ooh, he really let me have it.

863
00:42:39,287 --> 00:42:42,293
What? No, look, you said
you could help them, right?

864
00:42:42,295 --> 00:42:43,652
Every curse has a core,

865
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:46,169
the center of its power.

866
00:42:46,171 --> 00:42:47,822
And only one weapon
forged of

867
00:42:47,824 --> 00:42:49,904
the rarest metals
can destroy it,

868
00:42:49,906 --> 00:42:51,953
my enchanted sword,

869
00:42:51,955 --> 00:42:54,400
the Curse Crusher!

870
00:42:54,402 --> 00:42:57,474
Well, okay, but you don't
seem to have that on you.

871
00:42:57,476 --> 00:42:59,259
I sold it.

872
00:42:59,261 --> 00:43:01,210
Got in a little tax trouble
a few years back.

873
00:43:01,212 --> 00:43:04,483
But don't worry,
I know just where to find it.

874
00:43:04,485 --> 00:43:05,739
I am on my way, boys.

875
00:43:05,741 --> 00:43:07,955
Just try to stay
out of trouble.

876
00:43:11,706 --> 00:43:14,415
What is
taking you so long?

877
00:43:14,417 --> 00:43:15,904
Who you
calling "whimsical"?

878
00:43:16,301 --> 00:43:17,687
Oh, no.

879
00:43:17,689 --> 00:43:19,142
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- You've got a lot of nerve.

880
00:43:19,144 --> 00:43:20,068
I'm just saying,

881
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:22,316
sprites used to fly around
spreading delight.

882
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:23,439
That's a good thing.

883
00:43:23,441 --> 00:43:25,027
Sprites can't fly.

884
00:43:25,029 --> 00:43:28,134
Well, your wings don't work
'cause you stopped using them.

885
00:43:28,136 --> 00:43:30,829
- You calling me lazy?
- No, no, no.

886
00:43:30,831 --> 00:43:33,011
Not you.
Your ancestors.

887
00:43:33,013 --> 00:43:35,259
What did you say
about my ancestors?

888
00:43:35,261 --> 00:43:36,417
I didn't mean lazy...

889
00:43:36,419 --> 00:43:37,937
I'm sorry, very sorry.
He's sorry, too.

890
00:43:37,939 --> 00:43:39,656
You don't need to fly.
Who needs to fly?

891
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:41,012
I mean, you've got
those great bikes.

892
00:43:41,014 --> 00:43:43,227
What are you doing?
I was just discussing history.

893
00:43:43,229 --> 00:43:45,639
Barley, I'm trying to
take care of you and Dad,

894
00:43:45,641 --> 00:43:47,326
and you're not making it
any easier.

895
00:43:47,328 --> 00:43:48,915
Dad, come on.

896
00:43:50,006 --> 00:43:51,062
Oh, no.

897
00:43:52,583 --> 00:43:55,493
Hey! You're dead!

898
00:43:57,187 --> 00:43:58,639
We're dead! We're dead!
We're dead!

899
00:43:58,641 --> 00:44:01,085
Relax. They won't be
able to lift those bikes.

900
00:44:01,087 --> 00:44:02,672
They are strong.

901
00:44:02,674 --> 00:44:04,755
We're gonna die! We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!

902
00:44:04,757 --> 00:44:05,813
It's locked.

903
00:44:05,815 --> 00:44:06,807
What?
Where are the keys?

904
00:44:09,946 --> 00:44:11,368
I got this.

905
00:44:12,095 --> 00:44:13,614
Come on, Barley.

906
00:44:13,616 --> 00:44:15,203
Whoa!

907
00:44:16,591 --> 00:44:17,779
Okay, go, go, go!

908
00:44:19,301 --> 00:44:21,349
No. No, no, no. No way.

909
00:44:21,351 --> 00:44:22,541
You're gonna have to.

910
00:44:27,864 --> 00:44:29,150
Come on.
Why won't it start?

911
00:44:29,152 --> 00:44:30,275
There's a sweet spot.

912
00:44:30,277 --> 00:44:31,663
Not in the middle,
not quite at the end.

913
00:44:31,665 --> 00:44:33,087
Come on.
Come on. Come on.

914
00:44:34,177 --> 00:44:36,656
Come on, Guinevere!

915
00:44:36,658 --> 00:44:39,335
Put it in "o" for "onward."

916
00:44:44,921 --> 00:44:46,244
Drive!

917
00:44:49,749 --> 00:44:51,928
Okay, you're gonna
have to merge.

918
00:44:53,782 --> 00:44:54,935
- Speed up!
- I can't do this.

919
00:44:54,937 --> 00:44:56,556
- Yes, you can.
- I'm not ready!

920
00:44:56,558 --> 00:44:58,440
You'll never be ready. Merge!

921
00:45:01,451 --> 00:45:03,500
Nice job!

922
00:45:08,822 --> 00:45:11,037
- Hey, don't hit Gwinny.
- Barley!

923
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:15,762
- Oh, no.
- Get around 'em!

924
00:45:15,764 --> 00:45:17,350
- They're not letting me in.
- Signal.

925
00:45:17,352 --> 00:45:18,638
You don't have a signaler.

926
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,153
Stick your arm straight out
the window to signal left.

927
00:45:28,062 --> 00:45:30,905
- Get back here.
- Just keep driving.

928
00:45:37,087 --> 00:45:38,508
Barley!

929
00:45:42,028 --> 00:45:44,173
The mountains are north.

930
00:45:44,175 --> 00:45:45,763
You need to get
all the way over.

931
00:45:49,598 --> 00:45:50,653
What the...?

932
00:45:51,845 --> 00:45:54,325
Oh, it is on, Shades!
Get 'em!

933
00:46:26,024 --> 00:46:28,405
- Ian, stay focused!
- I can't!

934
00:46:28,742 --> 00:46:32,015
You have to focus
or we are all dead!

935
00:46:33,352 --> 00:46:35,467
Just stay cool.

936
00:46:43,872 --> 00:46:45,920
Way to go, Guinevere!

937
00:46:50,317 --> 00:46:51,309
Hit it!

938
00:46:55,011 --> 00:46:56,763
We're not gonna make it!

939
00:47:14,094 --> 00:47:15,481
Dad, are you okay?

940
00:47:15,483 --> 00:47:17,661
He's fine, thanks to
the skillful driving

941
00:47:17,663 --> 00:47:20,241
of Sir Ian Lightfoot.
High five!

942
00:47:20,243 --> 00:47:21,464
What is happening?

943
00:47:21,466 --> 00:47:23,614
I think the spell
is wearing off.

944
00:47:24,506 --> 00:47:25,696
Get off my face.

945
00:47:32,705 --> 00:47:35,446
Chantor's Talon! Cops!

946
00:47:35,448 --> 00:47:36,935
- Pull over.
- I don't have a license.

947
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:38,821
My wallet's still tiny.

948
00:47:43,349 --> 00:47:45,397
<i>Step out
of the vehicle.</i>

949
00:47:45,399 --> 00:47:46,719
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

950
00:47:46,721 --> 00:47:48,705
How are we gonna explain...?
Oh, no. Dad!

951
00:47:58,516 --> 00:48:00,498
You have a long night
there, buddy?

952
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:01,588
Sir, I'm gonna ask you

953
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:02,647
to walk this straight line.

954
00:48:02,649 --> 00:48:03,936
They're gonna take Dad.

955
00:48:03,938 --> 00:48:04,796
Okay, okay.

956
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:07,340
Oh, I got it.
The disguise spell.

957
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:10,151
You can disguise yourself
to be anyone you want.

958
00:48:10,153 --> 00:48:11,274
But what if I
mess up again?

959
00:48:11,276 --> 00:48:12,431
According to the spell,

960
00:48:12,433 --> 00:48:14,315
"Disguising yourself
is a lie,

961
00:48:14,317 --> 00:48:16,168
"so you must tell the truth
to get by."

962
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:19,241
As long as you don't tell a
lie, the spell will be fine.

963
00:48:19,243 --> 00:48:22,580
Okay. Who are
we gonna be?

964
00:48:22,582 --> 00:48:24,730
Okay, we're taking you
down to the station.

965
00:48:24,732 --> 00:48:27,705
What seems to be the problem

966
00:48:27,707 --> 00:48:31,142
here, fellow police folk?

967
00:48:31,144 --> 00:48:32,233
Officer Bronco?

968
00:48:32,235 --> 00:48:33,769
Were you in that van?

969
00:48:33,771 --> 00:48:35,256
Affirmative.
And we will...

970
00:48:35,258 --> 00:48:37,570
I mean, I will take
full responsibility

971
00:48:37,572 --> 00:48:38,859
for that fella right there,

972
00:48:38,861 --> 00:48:41,041
so you can just release him
over to me.

973
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:42,759
Hey,
I wanted to be the front.

974
00:48:42,761 --> 00:48:44,115
No way.
I'll do the talking.

975
00:48:44,117 --> 00:48:45,537
Bronco, I thought
you were working

976
00:48:45,539 --> 00:48:46,760
on the other
side of town.

977
00:48:46,762 --> 00:48:48,415
I, uh, changed my mind.

978
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:51,256
Something wrong?

979
00:48:51,258 --> 00:48:53,143
Just a little neck cramp.

980
00:48:54,629 --> 00:48:56,743
You have to stop lying.

981
00:48:56,745 --> 00:48:58,627
Answer every question
with a question.

982
00:48:58,629 --> 00:49:00,578
What exactly
are you doing out here?

983
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:02,826
Uh... What am I doing
out here?

984
00:49:02,828 --> 00:49:05,668
What are any of us
doing out here?

985
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:08,809
Whoa. I never thought
about it like that.

986
00:49:08,811 --> 00:49:10,000
Nice.

987
00:49:10,002 --> 00:49:12,215
With all due respect,
you didn't answer my question.

988
00:49:12,217 --> 00:49:14,561
Well, we were
just exercising

989
00:49:14,563 --> 00:49:18,563
some driver's education
drills for Ian.

990
00:49:19,522 --> 00:49:21,273
Who is Ian?

991
00:49:21,275 --> 00:49:23,487
Oh, is that
Laurel's kid?

992
00:49:23,489 --> 00:49:26,297
Ian is Laurel's kid.

993
00:49:26,299 --> 00:49:29,107
Your stepson was swerving
all over the road.

994
00:49:29,109 --> 00:49:30,330
Yeah, well...

995
00:49:30,332 --> 00:49:32,412
that guy's
not all there today.

996
00:49:32,414 --> 00:49:35,390
Yeah, he does seem
a little off.

997
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:39,322
You seem
a little off yourself.

998
00:49:39,324 --> 00:49:43,091
Uh, actually, if I'm being
completely honest,

999
00:49:43,093 --> 00:49:44,380
I'm not super great

1000
00:49:44,382 --> 00:49:45,802
in this kind
of situation,

1001
00:49:45,804 --> 00:49:47,818
and I'm starting
to freak out a little bit.

1002
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:51,355
And I'm all sweaty and weird,
and I don't know what to say

1003
00:49:51,357 --> 00:49:53,768
and I just feel like
I can't do anything right,

1004
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:55,255
and I'm a total weirdo.

1005
00:49:55,257 --> 00:49:57,901
Hold on, hold on.

1006
00:49:57,903 --> 00:50:00,479
I think I know
what's going on here.

1007
00:50:00,481 --> 00:50:02,065
Uh... You do?

1008
00:50:02,067 --> 00:50:04,247
It's not easy
being a new parent.

1009
00:50:04,249 --> 00:50:06,793
My girlfriend's daughter got
me pulling my hair out, okay?

1010
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:08,711
Oh. Oh, yeah.

1011
00:50:08,713 --> 00:50:10,462
All right,
we can let him go.

1012
00:50:10,464 --> 00:50:14,496
Okay, well, I'm just gonna
take him to the van.

1013
00:50:14,498 --> 00:50:17,504
Hey, it gets better. All right?
Good luck, Bronco.

1014
00:50:17,506 --> 00:50:19,024
You, too, Officer.

1015
00:50:19,026 --> 00:50:21,769
Keep workin' hard
or hardly workin'.

1016
00:50:22,993 --> 00:50:25,636
Now, that was
a good Colt.

1017
00:50:25,638 --> 00:50:27,190
I don't envy you,
Bronco.

1018
00:50:27,192 --> 00:50:29,372
That Lightfoot kid
is a handful.

1019
00:50:29,374 --> 00:50:32,181
Uh, I'm gonna have to
disagree with you there.

1020
00:50:32,183 --> 00:50:35,355
I think Ian's
a pretty stand-up citizen.

1021
00:50:35,357 --> 00:50:38,099
Not him,
the older one.

1022
00:50:38,101 --> 00:50:38,958
What?

1023
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,735
I mean,
the guy's a screwup.

1024
00:50:41,737 --> 00:50:43,521
You can't say
you don't agree.

1025
00:50:43,523 --> 00:50:45,109
Um, I don't.

1026
00:50:47,490 --> 00:50:48,679
What?

1027
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:51,527
I mean, okay, well...

1028
00:50:51,529 --> 00:50:54,040
I gotta get going.
Gotta get Ian home.

1029
00:50:54,042 --> 00:50:56,718
I mean, I'm late for work.

1030
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,502
Sorry, I mean,
I'm feelin' a little sick.

1031
00:50:58,504 --> 00:51:00,519
I mean tired.
Sick and tired. Gotta go!

1032
00:51:00,521 --> 00:51:01,877
See you Monday!

1033
00:51:05,777 --> 00:51:08,883
Oh, man.
Bronco is losin' it.

1034
00:51:08,885 --> 00:51:10,801
See, that's why
I never got married.

1035
00:51:10,803 --> 00:51:12,984
Old Gore can't
be tied down.

1036
00:51:18,438 --> 00:51:20,024
This is Specter.

1037
00:51:20,026 --> 00:51:23,661
Can you put me through
to Officer Colt Bronco?

1038
00:51:33,546 --> 00:51:37,016
Barley, I don't know
what happened back there.

1039
00:51:37,018 --> 00:51:39,298
But I don't think
you're a screwup.

1040
00:51:41,745 --> 00:51:44,621
Maybe the magic just got it
wrong, you know.

1041
00:51:45,554 --> 00:51:46,708
Yeah.

1042
00:51:48,925 --> 00:51:51,238
I don't know
what happened.

1043
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,452
Barley! Barley!

1044
00:52:00,032 --> 00:52:01,817
Where are you going?

1045
00:52:03,306 --> 00:52:05,320
Barley, come on.
This is all just...

1046
00:52:05,322 --> 00:52:06,543
I'm not a screwup.

1047
00:52:06,545 --> 00:52:07,798
I didn't say
you were.

1048
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,518
The magic said it for you.

1049
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,105
Well, the magic
got it wrong.

1050
00:52:11,107 --> 00:52:12,757
Magic doesn't
get it wrong!

1051
00:52:12,759 --> 00:52:14,047
The cop asked a question,

1052
00:52:14,049 --> 00:52:16,911
you answered, and magic
revealed the truth. Right?

1053
00:52:16,913 --> 00:52:17,724
Right?

1054
00:52:17,726 --> 00:52:19,740
I don't know how
any of this stuff works.

1055
00:52:19,742 --> 00:52:21,525
All I know is
that everything

1056
00:52:21,527 --> 00:52:23,178
we've done tonight
has gone wrong.

1057
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:25,063
Yeah, it's gone wrong because
you won't listen to me.

1058
00:52:25,065 --> 00:52:26,187
Are you kidding?

1059
00:52:26,189 --> 00:52:27,807
Because everything we've
done has been your idea.

1060
00:52:27,809 --> 00:52:29,063
But you didn't do it my way.

1061
00:52:29,065 --> 00:52:30,748
You didn't let me
handle the Manticore.

1062
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:32,501
You freaked out when I
talked to the sprites.

1063
00:52:32,503 --> 00:52:33,988
'Cause you don't think
I have good ideas.

1064
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:35,178
What? Of course I do.

1065
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:37,823
Great! Then I think we should
take the Path of Peril.

1066
00:52:37,825 --> 00:52:40,964
And I also think that
would be good, normally...

1067
00:52:40,966 --> 00:52:41,823
See?

1068
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:43,509
But, I told you,
this isn't a game.

1069
00:52:43,511 --> 00:52:45,295
All that matters today
is Dad,

1070
00:52:45,297 --> 00:52:47,476
and right now
he's sitting in that van,

1071
00:52:47,478 --> 00:52:48,931
and he's confused...

1072
00:52:48,933 --> 00:52:49,924
What?

1073
00:52:53,693 --> 00:52:54,914
What is he doing?

1074
00:52:54,916 --> 00:52:57,426
I think he can feel the
vibrations of the music,

1075
00:52:57,428 --> 00:52:59,941
and he's dancing.

1076
00:53:03,768 --> 00:53:04,794
Wow.

1077
00:53:05,355 --> 00:53:07,702
He is terrible.

1078
00:53:13,091 --> 00:53:15,669
Yeah. He's really,
really bad.

1079
00:53:16,462 --> 00:53:18,147
Oh, no.
Here he comes.

1080
00:53:18,149 --> 00:53:20,195
No, no, no. Thanks, Dad.
Dad, thank you.

1081
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:21,320
I'm good.

1082
00:53:21,322 --> 00:53:22,576
Stop.

1083
00:53:22,578 --> 00:53:24,422
Okay. Okay.

1084
00:53:24,609 --> 00:53:26,028
No, no, no!

1085
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:27,846
I'm not really
a big dancer.

1086
00:53:27,848 --> 00:53:29,237
Uh...

1087
00:53:31,618 --> 00:53:34,591
Just imagine what the top half
of this dance looks like.

1088
00:53:34,593 --> 00:53:36,840
I bet it goes
something like this.

1089
00:53:45,799 --> 00:53:47,086
Ow.

1090
00:53:47,088 --> 00:53:49,403
Ah, you danced your
shoelaces loose there, Pop.

1091
00:53:53,139 --> 00:53:56,114
You know,
I wanna see him, too.

1092
00:53:57,436 --> 00:53:59,814
Yeah, I know.

1093
00:53:59,816 --> 00:54:01,697
It's not fair for you
to call me a screwup

1094
00:54:01,699 --> 00:54:04,708
if you don't give me a chance
to get something right.

1095
00:54:05,303 --> 00:54:07,221
Just do one thing
my way.

1096
00:54:08,444 --> 00:54:11,021
You really think
this Path of Peril

1097
00:54:11,023 --> 00:54:13,072
is the best way
to go to the mountain?

1098
00:54:17,006 --> 00:54:18,163
Okay.

1099
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:35,582
Uh... So, where is
your magic sword?

1100
00:54:35,584 --> 00:54:37,832
It lies beyond
those gates.

1101
00:54:39,327 --> 00:54:41,771
If we don't leave here
with the sword,

1102
00:54:41,773 --> 00:54:43,755
your boys are doomed.

1103
00:54:43,757 --> 00:54:45,011
There you are.

1104
00:54:45,013 --> 00:54:46,764
One garlic crusher.

1105
00:54:46,766 --> 00:54:48,218
No, Curse Crusher.

1106
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:50,399
It's a large magical sword.

1107
00:54:50,401 --> 00:54:51,557
Sword.

1108
00:54:51,559 --> 00:54:53,904
Sword, sword, sword.

1109
00:54:53,906 --> 00:54:55,558
I mean, I got this thing.

1110
00:54:56,748 --> 00:54:58,267
- That's it!
- How much?

1111
00:54:59,228 --> 00:55:01,904
- Let's call it, uh, 10.
- Great!

1112
00:55:01,906 --> 00:55:03,589
Forged of
the rarest metals,

1113
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:06,565
the only sword of its kind
in all the land.

1114
00:55:07,558 --> 00:55:10,664
Hello, old friend.
We shall never part again.

1115
00:55:10,666 --> 00:55:12,648
Oh! Turns out this sword

1116
00:55:12,650 --> 00:55:15,920
is the only sword of its
kind in all the land.

1117
00:55:15,922 --> 00:55:19,820
So, let's call it 10,000.

1118
00:55:19,822 --> 00:55:23,292
- You can't do that!
- Well, I just did.

1119
00:55:23,294 --> 00:55:24,813
Okay, you had better...

1120
00:55:24,815 --> 00:55:26,762
Yeah?

1121
00:55:26,764 --> 00:55:28,417
Hey, I talked
to some other officers,

1122
00:55:28,419 --> 00:55:30,631
and they said the boys
were last seen going north.

1123
00:55:30,633 --> 00:55:32,185
- Are they okay?
- <i>They're fine.</i>

1124
00:55:32,187 --> 00:55:34,466
But the officers said...
Well, honey,

1125
00:55:34,468 --> 00:55:37,019
<i>this night keeps getting
stranger and stranger.</i>

1126
00:55:37,021 --> 00:55:38,671
Do you know who I am?

1127
00:55:38,673 --> 00:55:40,820
Some kind of
winged bear-snake lady?

1128
00:55:40,822 --> 00:55:43,101
Argh! Winged
lion-scorpion lady!

1129
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:44,456
It sure does.

1130
00:55:44,458 --> 00:55:45,944
Listen, I need
that sword.

1131
00:55:45,946 --> 00:55:47,961
My sons have a
once-in-a-lifetime chance

1132
00:55:47,963 --> 00:55:49,019
to see their father.

1133
00:55:49,021 --> 00:55:50,013
Now, my oldest son...

1134
00:55:51,632 --> 00:55:53,845
Holy son of a...
You killed her!

1135
00:55:53,847 --> 00:55:56,522
It's okay. She's only
temporarily paralyzed.

1136
00:55:56,524 --> 00:55:58,176
Hey, you can't do this.

1137
00:55:58,178 --> 00:56:00,060
- Well, I just did.
- Grab the sword.

1138
00:56:00,062 --> 00:56:01,250
Don't you touch that.

1139
00:56:01,252 --> 00:56:02,406
Here you go.

1140
00:56:02,408 --> 00:56:03,895
And a little something extra
for your trouble.

1141
00:56:03,897 --> 00:56:05,051
I love your store.

1142
00:56:05,053 --> 00:56:06,574
Oh, that's so pretty.

1143
00:56:07,004 --> 00:56:08,688
Hey! Hey!

1144
00:56:08,690 --> 00:56:10,473
Yeah!

1145
00:56:10,475 --> 00:56:11,861
Laurel, what's happening?

1146
00:56:11,863 --> 00:56:13,679
- Yeah!
- <i>Hello? Are you all right?</i>

1147
00:56:13,681 --> 00:56:14,638
<i>Laurel?</i>

1148
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:17,085
Oh, Colt, I can't talk.
The boys need me.

1149
00:56:17,087 --> 00:56:18,936
Wait!

1150
00:56:18,938 --> 00:56:20,591
Dang those kids.

1151
00:56:24,954 --> 00:56:26,143
Huh.

1152
00:56:52,143 --> 00:56:53,991
<i>♪ We're heading on a quest</i>

1153
00:56:53,993 --> 00:56:55,710
<i>♪ Our father we must retrieve</i>

1154
00:56:55,712 --> 00:56:57,859
<i>♪ The Lightfoot brothers
can't be stopped</i>

1155
00:56:57,861 --> 00:56:59,413
<i>♪ Something, something</i>

1156
00:56:59,415 --> 00:57:01,265
<i>♪ That rhymes with retrieve</i>

1157
00:57:05,537 --> 00:57:07,783
Yeah, we're still here.

1158
00:57:07,785 --> 00:57:11,156
Well, good morning to thee,
dear Lightfoot men.

1159
00:57:11,158 --> 00:57:13,669
Welcome to
the Path of Peril.

1160
00:57:13,850 --> 00:57:15,964
It's not
much of a path.

1161
00:57:15,966 --> 00:57:18,608
Well, you know, they never
really developed around here.

1162
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:20,526
So, heads up, we could
run into anything.

1163
00:57:20,528 --> 00:57:23,765
A centicore, wolf dragon,
gelatinous cube.

1164
00:57:23,767 --> 00:57:26,212
Okay, what is
a gelatinous cube?

1165
00:57:26,214 --> 00:57:28,095
Oh, it's
a giant green cube

1166
00:57:28,097 --> 00:57:30,971
that instantly disintegrates
all that it touches.

1167
00:57:30,973 --> 00:57:32,856
We are not gonna
run into a... Oh! Stop!

1168
00:57:32,858 --> 00:57:34,412
Ahh!

1169
00:57:43,161 --> 00:57:44,448
What is this?

1170
00:57:44,450 --> 00:57:45,836
Bottomless pit.

1171
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:49,803
Whatever falls in there,
falls forever.

1172
00:57:52,549 --> 00:57:54,862
Aw, Dad, come here.

1173
00:57:54,864 --> 00:57:55,820
Ian, check it out.

1174
00:57:55,822 --> 00:57:59,292
This is
an ancient drawbridge.

1175
00:57:59,294 --> 00:58:00,547
We lower that bad boy

1176
00:58:00,549 --> 00:58:03,293
and we are on our way
to Raven's Point.

1177
00:58:03,811 --> 00:58:05,992
Look around for a lever.

1178
00:58:07,770 --> 00:58:08,959
Found it.

1179
00:58:08,961 --> 00:58:11,506
But it's on
the other side.

1180
00:58:12,306 --> 00:58:14,455
Okay, I got this.

1181
00:58:14,885 --> 00:58:16,472
<i>Aloft Elevar.</i>

1182
00:58:20,868 --> 00:58:22,486
You can't cast
a levitation spell

1183
00:58:22,488 --> 00:58:23,874
on something
that far away.

1184
00:58:23,876 --> 00:58:26,057
It only has, like, a 15-meter
enchanting radius.

1185
00:58:26,059 --> 00:58:28,042
Dad, can you
believe this guy?

1186
00:58:29,099 --> 00:58:31,709
What we need
is a Trust Bridge.

1187
00:58:31,711 --> 00:58:34,056
It's a spell that creates
a magical bridge

1188
00:58:34,058 --> 00:58:35,379
you can walk on.

1189
00:58:35,381 --> 00:58:38,303
Just say
<i>"Bridgrigar Invisia."</i>

1190
00:58:38,305 --> 00:58:40,483
Okay.
<i>Bridgrigar Invisia.</i>

1191
00:58:40,485 --> 00:58:42,800
<i>Bridgrigar Invisia!</i>

1192
00:58:45,676 --> 00:58:47,890
- It didn't work.
- No, the spell's still going.

1193
00:58:47,892 --> 00:58:50,368
You won't know if your bridge
worked until you step on it.

1194
00:58:50,370 --> 00:58:51,625
Step on what?

1195
00:58:51,627 --> 00:58:53,575
If you believe the bridge
is there, then it's there.

1196
00:58:53,577 --> 00:58:55,624
- But it's not.
- Well, not with that attitude.

1197
00:58:55,626 --> 00:58:57,875
I'm not gonna step out
onto nothing.

1198
00:59:00,916 --> 00:59:02,434
Now we've got a rope.

1199
00:59:02,436 --> 00:59:04,022
But you're not gonna
even need it because...

1200
00:59:04,024 --> 00:59:05,244
- I want the rope!
- Okay.

1201
00:59:05,246 --> 00:59:07,030
I'm just saying you're not
gonna need the rope,

1202
00:59:07,032 --> 00:59:09,246
because I know
you can make that bridge.

1203
00:59:19,094 --> 00:59:21,439
I'm dying! I'm dying! I'm dead!
I'm dead! I'm dead!

1204
00:59:21,441 --> 00:59:23,224
- Oh, my life is over.
- I got you.

1205
00:59:26,498 --> 00:59:27,720
Okay, you fell.

1206
00:59:27,722 --> 00:59:29,471
- But was that so bad?
- Yes!

1207
00:59:29,473 --> 00:59:32,480
- Are you still alive?
- Yes.

1208
00:59:32,482 --> 00:59:35,357
Okay, so now you know
the worst that can happen.

1209
00:59:35,359 --> 00:59:37,805
So, there's nothing
to be scared of, right?

1210
00:59:41,414 --> 00:59:44,258
<i>Bridgrigar Invisia!</i>

1211
00:59:47,199 --> 00:59:50,902
Hey. You can do this.

1212
00:59:59,399 --> 01:00:01,744
- Yeah!
- There you go!

1213
01:00:03,928 --> 01:00:05,877
Believe with
every step.

1214
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:10,123
Oh, yeah!

1215
01:00:13,628 --> 01:00:14,750
You've got me, right?

1216
01:00:14,752 --> 01:00:15,942
I still got you.

1217
01:00:17,602 --> 01:00:20,577
Ian Lightfoot
is fearless.

1218
01:00:24,097 --> 01:00:26,542
This is amazing!

1219
01:00:29,088 --> 01:00:30,639
Yeah! But just keep going.

1220
01:00:30,641 --> 01:00:33,683
Don't look back.
Just straight ahead.

1221
01:00:35,335 --> 01:00:37,548
You've still got
the rope, right?

1222
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:39,168
Yeah, I got it.

1223
01:00:39,170 --> 01:00:41,879
I am not afraid!

1224
01:00:41,881 --> 01:00:44,788
Oh, man, I could stay
out here all day.

1225
01:00:44,790 --> 01:00:46,110
Huh. Huh.

1226
01:00:46,112 --> 01:00:48,854
Okay, but keep moving.
We've gotta see Dad, remember?

1227
01:00:48,856 --> 01:00:52,493
Hey, Dad,
this last step is for you.

1228
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:55,728
Ahh!

1229
01:01:00,704 --> 01:01:02,489
Oh.

1230
01:01:09,191 --> 01:01:11,039
He did it, Dad.

1231
01:01:18,527 --> 01:01:20,806
That was amazing.

1232
01:01:20,808 --> 01:01:23,535
How long was
the rope gone?

1233
01:01:23,537 --> 01:01:26,479
Oh, just, like,
the second half of it.

1234
01:01:26,975 --> 01:01:29,088
I needed that rope.

1235
01:01:29,090 --> 01:01:31,437
Oh, but did you?

1236
01:01:36,842 --> 01:01:39,256
Ian! Look.

1237
01:01:40,577 --> 01:01:42,130
It's a raven.

1238
01:01:43,088 --> 01:01:46,097
The clue on the menu said
Raven's Point.

1239
01:01:46,824 --> 01:01:49,664
Yeah.
In the mountains.

1240
01:01:49,666 --> 01:01:52,045
But maybe the puzzle
didn't mean the mountain.

1241
01:01:52,047 --> 01:01:54,956
Maybe it means follow
where the raven is pointing.

1242
01:01:58,408 --> 01:02:00,887
It's another raven.

1243
01:02:00,889 --> 01:02:03,234
That one could be
pointing to another raven,

1244
01:02:03,236 --> 01:02:05,151
all the way to the gem.

1245
01:02:05,153 --> 01:02:07,498
I... I had us going
the wrong way.

1246
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:09,713
Well, I told you.
My gut knows where to go.

1247
01:02:09,715 --> 01:02:11,796
Don't you, boy?
Yes, you do.

1248
01:02:12,837 --> 01:02:14,256
- Huh.
- Come on, Dad.

1249
01:02:14,258 --> 01:02:16,570
Guinevere will get us
to that raven in no time.

1250
01:02:22,390 --> 01:02:25,595
You guys...

1251
01:02:25,597 --> 01:02:27,181
...are in trouble,
big time.

1252
01:02:27,183 --> 01:02:28,670
No, no, no, Colt.
We found a spell.

1253
01:02:28,672 --> 01:02:31,711
If we finish it before sunset,
we'll get to see our father.

1254
01:02:31,713 --> 01:02:33,429
Ahh!

1255
01:02:33,431 --> 01:02:35,016
Well, uh,
your mom told me

1256
01:02:35,018 --> 01:02:37,596
there was some kind of
strange

1257
01:02:37,598 --> 01:02:39,016
family issue going on,

1258
01:02:39,018 --> 01:02:42,090
and this is
definitely strange.

1259
01:02:42,092 --> 01:02:43,116
But no, dang it.

1260
01:02:43,118 --> 01:02:44,875
I'm not letting you
upset your mother anymore.

1261
01:02:44,877 --> 01:02:47,255
Now you get in the vehicle,
I'm escorting you home.

1262
01:02:47,257 --> 01:02:48,351
No. No way.

1263
01:02:48,353 --> 01:02:50,138
I'm giving you
to the count of three.

1264
01:02:52,381 --> 01:02:54,593
- Okay, we'll go.
- Ian.

1265
01:02:54,595 --> 01:02:56,843
He's a police officer.

1266
01:03:03,602 --> 01:03:04,724
What are you doing?

1267
01:03:04,726 --> 01:03:06,246
I don't know.

1268
01:03:07,237 --> 01:03:08,793
Son of a...

1269
01:03:11,238 --> 01:03:13,551
I need backup.
Runaway van!

1270
01:03:14,545 --> 01:03:17,301
Yeah! Iandore Lightfoot,
breaking the rules.

1271
01:03:17,303 --> 01:03:19,052
I can't believe
I'm running from the cops.

1272
01:03:19,054 --> 01:03:20,308
You're not running
from the cops,

1273
01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:22,721
you're running from
our mom's boyfriend.

1274
01:03:23,881 --> 01:03:25,996
Okay, now you're running
from the cops.

1275
01:03:37,218 --> 01:03:38,670
Hold on!

1276
01:03:38,672 --> 01:03:40,755
Whoa!

1277
01:03:44,161 --> 01:03:46,670
Yeah! Nice going,
Guinevere!

1278
01:04:02,091 --> 01:04:04,404
Oh, what did I do?
I shouldn't have driven away.

1279
01:04:04,406 --> 01:04:05,990
No, it was great.

1280
01:04:05,992 --> 01:04:07,577
Hey, block the road
with those boulders.

1281
01:04:07,579 --> 01:04:09,296
What? How?

1282
01:04:09,298 --> 01:04:10,221
Arcane Lightning.

1283
01:04:10,223 --> 01:04:11,907
You said that's
the hardest spell.

1284
01:04:11,909 --> 01:04:13,065
You are ready.

1285
01:04:13,067 --> 01:04:14,783
"To make lightning
strike with ease,

1286
01:04:14,785 --> 01:04:16,404
"one must follow
all decrees."

1287
01:04:16,406 --> 01:04:17,561
You have to
do everything.

1288
01:04:17,563 --> 01:04:18,652
Speak from
your heart's fire,

1289
01:04:18,654 --> 01:04:21,100
trust yourself, focus,
all of it.

1290
01:04:22,826 --> 01:04:25,602
<i>Voltar Thundasir.</i>

1291
01:04:26,305 --> 01:04:28,055
<i>Voltar Thundasir.</i>

1292
01:04:28,057 --> 01:04:29,906
<i>Voltar Thundasir!</i>

1293
01:04:36,394 --> 01:04:39,071
I can't! I can't do it.

1294
01:04:40,493 --> 01:04:44,791
We're not gonna see you, Dad.
And it's all my fault.

1295
01:05:03,879 --> 01:05:05,169
What are you doing?

1296
01:05:49,793 --> 01:05:51,347
What the...?

1297
01:06:00,346 --> 01:06:01,865
Barley.

1298
01:06:01,867 --> 01:06:04,642
She was just
a beat-up old van.

1299
01:06:05,576 --> 01:06:07,658
Come on, we gotta go.

1300
01:07:10,583 --> 01:07:11,772
Wait.

1301
01:07:25,701 --> 01:07:27,318
Oh. You see that, Dad?

1302
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:30,394
The apprentice has become
the master.

1303
01:07:32,477 --> 01:07:34,064
It looks like water.

1304
01:07:38,823 --> 01:07:40,938
So, what's the,
uh, X mean?

1305
01:07:40,940 --> 01:07:44,178
On a quest,
an X only means one thing.

1306
01:07:44,180 --> 01:07:47,783
We go to the end of the water,
we'll find that Phoenix Gem.

1307
01:07:59,601 --> 01:08:00,658
Unicorns!

1308
01:08:19,309 --> 01:08:20,598
Whoa.

1309
01:08:22,721 --> 01:08:24,341
Cool.

1310
01:08:27,349 --> 01:08:30,205
This water
could go on for miles.

1311
01:08:30,207 --> 01:08:32,424
We don't have
that kinda time.

1312
01:08:32,426 --> 01:08:34,403
If we had something
to float on,

1313
01:08:34,405 --> 01:08:36,386
we could cast
a velocity spell on it,

1314
01:08:36,388 --> 01:08:38,370
fly down the tunnel
like a magic jet ski.

1315
01:08:38,372 --> 01:08:40,683
Well, there's not
much to float on.

1316
01:08:40,685 --> 01:08:42,435
Remember, on a quest,

1317
01:08:42,437 --> 01:08:45,049
you have to use
what you've got.

1318
01:08:46,842 --> 01:08:48,990
<i>Magnora Gantuan!</i>

1319
01:08:50,974 --> 01:08:52,560
Woo-hoo!

1320
01:08:53,526 --> 01:08:55,113
<i>Accelior!</i>

1321
01:08:56,105 --> 01:08:57,425
Whoa!

1322
01:08:57,427 --> 01:08:59,938
This is
actually kinda cool.

1323
01:08:59,940 --> 01:09:02,616
So, what other spells
do you know?

1324
01:09:02,618 --> 01:09:05,061
Brace
yourself, young mage.

1325
01:09:05,063 --> 01:09:08,071
I know all there is
to know of magic.

1326
01:09:10,764 --> 01:09:12,184
Colt, we know
where the boys are going.

1327
01:09:12,186 --> 01:09:14,465
We just have to get to them
before they unleash the curse.

1328
01:09:14,467 --> 01:09:17,076
- <i>The what?</i>
- Let's crush some curses!

1329
01:09:17,078 --> 01:09:18,696
The curse. The curse
that protects the gem

1330
01:09:18,698 --> 01:09:20,283
by turning into a rock
dragon or something.

1331
01:09:20,285 --> 01:09:21,340
<i>A what dragon?</i>

1332
01:09:21,342 --> 01:09:22,465
I can't explain it.

1333
01:09:22,467 --> 01:09:24,184
I just know we have
to get to the boys fast.

1334
01:09:24,186 --> 01:09:26,764
Oh, we'll get to them fast.
We'll get to them so fast.

1335
01:09:27,293 --> 01:09:28,613
Oh!

1336
01:09:28,615 --> 01:09:31,522
Well, I almost had 'em,
but Ian, he just drove off.

1337
01:09:31,524 --> 01:09:33,058
- Huh. Good for him.
- <i>What?</i>

1338
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:34,776
No, I just mean
he's scared to drive.

1339
01:09:34,778 --> 01:09:36,893
Thinks something's gonna
come at him out of the...

1340
01:09:47,307 --> 01:09:49,058
Oh! I think
I stung my leg.

1341
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:51,106
<i>Laurel, what happened?
What's goin' on?</i>

1342
01:09:51,108 --> 01:09:52,528
You almost
killed me, lady.

1343
01:09:52,530 --> 01:09:54,678
Are you okay?
Where did you come from?

1344
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:55,967
You were
in our flight path.

1345
01:09:57,158 --> 01:09:59,040
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

1346
01:09:59,042 --> 01:10:00,562
Oh, no. Our transport!

1347
01:10:00,564 --> 01:10:02,644
How are we going
to get to your sons now?

1348
01:10:02,646 --> 01:10:05,851
Come on, Pixie Dusters,
let's take to the skies.

1349
01:10:05,853 --> 01:10:08,067
- Yeah!
- I was born to fly!

1350
01:10:08,717 --> 01:10:11,659
How do you feel about
exercising those wings?

1351
01:10:12,552 --> 01:10:13,743
Uh...

1352
01:10:16,056 --> 01:10:17,410
<i>Boombastia!</i>

1353
01:10:17,412 --> 01:10:19,825
- Ah, remember...
- Oh, right.

1354
01:10:20,255 --> 01:10:21,709
<i>Boombastia!</i>

1355
01:10:22,576 --> 01:10:23,731
Whoa!

1356
01:10:23,733 --> 01:10:26,640
Yeah! You're a natural!
Think fast.

1357
01:10:26,642 --> 01:10:27,897
<i>Aloft Elevar!</i>

1358
01:10:27,899 --> 01:10:29,981
Yeah! Nice!

1359
01:10:31,006 --> 01:10:32,723
Careful how much boat
you're eating there, man,

1360
01:10:32,725 --> 01:10:34,806
we still gotta make it
to the end of the tunnel.

1361
01:10:34,808 --> 01:10:36,361
Yeah. Good point.

1362
01:10:39,192 --> 01:10:41,737
I can't believe
I'm this close

1363
01:10:41,739 --> 01:10:43,621
to actually
talking to Dad.

1364
01:10:43,623 --> 01:10:44,712
You know what
I'm gonna ask him?

1365
01:10:44,714 --> 01:10:46,265
If he ever gave himself
a wizard name.

1366
01:10:46,267 --> 01:10:47,124
What?

1367
01:10:47,126 --> 01:10:48,182
Well, 'cause he was
into magic.

1368
01:10:48,184 --> 01:10:49,703
Lots of wizards
have cool names.

1369
01:10:49,705 --> 01:10:51,455
Alora the Majestic.

1370
01:10:51,457 --> 01:10:53,802
Birdar the Fanciful.

1371
01:10:53,804 --> 01:10:55,257
Anyway,
it'll just be nice

1372
01:10:55,259 --> 01:10:57,439
to have more than
four memories of him.

1373
01:10:57,441 --> 01:10:58,794
- Uh, three.
- Hmm?

1374
01:10:58,796 --> 01:11:00,381
You only have
three memories.

1375
01:11:00,383 --> 01:11:01,636
Oh, yeah.

1376
01:11:01,638 --> 01:11:02,927
Barley, do you have

1377
01:11:02,929 --> 01:11:04,876
another memory of Dad
you haven't told me?

1378
01:11:04,878 --> 01:11:08,348
No, it's just
not my favorite.

1379
01:11:08,350 --> 01:11:09,934
What do you mean?

1380
01:11:11,861 --> 01:11:14,702
When Dad was sick,

1381
01:11:14,704 --> 01:11:19,696
I was supposed to go in
and say goodbye to him.

1382
01:11:20,621 --> 01:11:23,928
But he was hooked up
to all these tubes,

1383
01:11:25,256 --> 01:11:28,199
and he just didn't
look like himself.

1384
01:11:29,092 --> 01:11:31,240
I got scared,

1385
01:11:32,166 --> 01:11:34,348
and I didn't go in.

1386
01:11:37,165 --> 01:11:38,353
That's when I decided

1387
01:11:38,355 --> 01:11:41,462
I was never gonna be
scared ever again.

1388
01:11:46,065 --> 01:11:48,875
Oh. Looks like
we're coming up on somethin'.

1389
01:11:58,501 --> 01:12:00,122
The final gauntlet.

1390
01:12:12,459 --> 01:12:15,268
The Phoenix Gem
is just on the other side.

1391
01:12:17,863 --> 01:12:20,836
Careful, there could be
booby traps.

1392
01:12:20,838 --> 01:12:22,819
This place is, like,
1,000 years old.

1393
01:12:22,821 --> 01:12:24,243
There's no way
there could be...

1394
01:12:30,788 --> 01:12:32,209
Oh, no.

1395
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:34,853
It can't be.

1396
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:38,392
A gelatinous cube!

1397
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:45,643
Run!

1398
01:12:45,645 --> 01:12:46,734
Whoa! Wait!
It's some kind of puzzle.

1399
01:12:46,736 --> 01:12:48,090
We gotta
figure it out before...

1400
01:12:48,092 --> 01:12:49,511
No time.
Grab a shield.

1401
01:13:01,711 --> 01:13:03,828
- Jump! Trust me!
- What?

1402
01:13:05,910 --> 01:13:07,001
<i>Aloft Elevar!</i>

1403
01:13:10,241 --> 01:13:11,430
Ow.

1404
01:13:13,051 --> 01:13:14,240
Ian.

1405
01:13:24,125 --> 01:13:25,478
Whew!

1406
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:27,695
Don't step on that.

1407
01:13:30,306 --> 01:13:32,554
I didn't touch it.

1408
01:13:36,521 --> 01:13:37,612
<i>Voltar Thundasir!</i>

1409
01:13:45,248 --> 01:13:47,726
The tile down there has the
same shape as the opening.

1410
01:13:47,728 --> 01:13:49,147
Maybe we were supposed
to step on it?

1411
01:13:49,149 --> 01:13:50,403
- What?
- I got it.

1412
01:13:50,405 --> 01:13:51,397
No, Barley!

1413
01:13:58,671 --> 01:13:59,992
Oh! It's working!

1414
01:14:02,934 --> 01:14:05,875
It's impossible.

1415
01:14:05,877 --> 01:14:08,520
No one can hold
their breath that long.

1416
01:14:41,513 --> 01:14:42,999
We made it!

1417
01:14:43,001 --> 01:14:44,024
Oh.

1418
01:14:44,026 --> 01:14:46,999
The Phoenix Gem
awaits beyond this door.

1419
01:14:47,001 --> 01:14:48,222
Shall we?

1420
01:14:48,224 --> 01:14:49,875
We certainly shall!

1421
01:14:49,877 --> 01:14:51,759
Dad, we have followed
the quest,

1422
01:14:51,761 --> 01:14:54,902
and it has led us
to our victory!

1423
01:15:13,810 --> 01:15:15,362
We're back home.

1424
01:15:15,364 --> 01:15:18,370
No, that doesn't make sense.
We took the Path of Peril.

1425
01:15:18,372 --> 01:15:19,461
We followed the ravens,

1426
01:15:19,463 --> 01:15:21,445
we went to the end
of the water...

1427
01:15:21,447 --> 01:15:24,057
Unless the X meant
stay away from the water.

1428
01:15:24,059 --> 01:15:26,107
Or it could be,
like, a campfire?

1429
01:15:26,109 --> 01:15:27,462
It's okay.
We can figure this out.

1430
01:15:27,464 --> 01:15:30,138
Figure out what?
We're back where we started.

1431
01:15:30,140 --> 01:15:31,627
I mean, it has to be here.
There was a gauntlet.

1432
01:15:31,629 --> 01:15:33,412
I mean, unless that
gauntlet was for,

1433
01:15:33,414 --> 01:15:35,263
coincidentally,
some different quest.

1434
01:15:35,265 --> 01:15:36,519
- That's a possibility.
- What?

1435
01:15:36,521 --> 01:15:39,298
No, no, no. This has to be
where the Phoenix Gem is.

1436
01:15:40,091 --> 01:15:41,381
I followed my gut.

1437
01:15:42,041 --> 01:15:44,851
- Oh, no.
- What?

1438
01:15:44,853 --> 01:15:46,933
The gem is
in the mountain.

1439
01:15:46,935 --> 01:15:48,784
The mountain
we could have been to

1440
01:15:48,786 --> 01:15:50,767
hours ago
if we just...

1441
01:15:50,769 --> 01:15:52,321
If we just stayed
on the expressway.

1442
01:15:52,323 --> 01:15:54,139
No, the expressway
is too obvious.

1443
01:15:54,141 --> 01:15:55,263
You can never take
the obvious...

1444
01:15:55,265 --> 01:15:57,809
If I hadn't listened
to you! Okay?

1445
01:15:57,811 --> 01:15:59,230
I can't believe this.

1446
01:15:59,232 --> 01:16:01,710
You act like you know
what you're doing,

1447
01:16:01,712 --> 01:16:03,065
but you don't
have a clue,

1448
01:16:03,067 --> 01:16:06,172
and that's because
you are a screwup.

1449
01:16:06,174 --> 01:16:07,726
And now you've
screwed up my chance

1450
01:16:07,728 --> 01:16:09,513
to have the one thing
I never had!

1451
01:16:15,893 --> 01:16:17,081
Where are you going?

1452
01:16:17,083 --> 01:16:19,860
To spend what little time
we have left with Dad.

1453
01:16:20,992 --> 01:16:22,973
Ian, wait!

1454
01:16:22,975 --> 01:16:25,683
We can still find
the Phoenix Gem.

1455
01:16:25,685 --> 01:16:27,900
We just have to
keep lookin'.

1456
01:16:28,668 --> 01:16:30,023
Ian!

1457
01:16:30,685 --> 01:16:31,941
Ian!

1458
01:16:43,511 --> 01:16:44,733
No, Dad.

1459
01:16:44,735 --> 01:16:45,858
He's not here.

1460
01:16:57,627 --> 01:17:00,172
Come on. Where is it?

1461
01:17:00,834 --> 01:17:02,221
Follow the water.

1462
01:17:08,867 --> 01:17:09,923
Ugh...

1463
01:17:09,925 --> 01:17:11,939
All right. Come on,
out of the fountain.

1464
01:17:11,941 --> 01:17:14,087
No, I'm looking
for an ancient gem.

1465
01:17:14,089 --> 01:17:16,038
Oh, yeah, we know.
"The old days."

1466
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:17,857
No! Stop! Please! No!

1467
01:17:17,859 --> 01:17:19,112
Okay, ow, okay!

1468
01:17:19,114 --> 01:17:21,162
Okay. I'm leaving.

1469
01:17:21,164 --> 01:17:24,004
- Hey!
- Come on!

1470
01:17:24,006 --> 01:17:27,344
Can someone call the cops?
We got the history buff again.

1471
01:17:54,355 --> 01:17:56,138
- <i>I can't do this.</i>
- <i>Yes, you can.</i>

1472
01:17:56,140 --> 01:17:58,982
- I'm not ready!
- You'll never be ready. Merge!

1473
01:18:00,998 --> 01:18:02,189
<i>Nice job!</i>

1474
01:18:10,487 --> 01:18:13,032
- Think fast.
- <i>Aloft Elevar!</i>

1475
01:18:48,173 --> 01:18:50,186
Woo-hoo!

1476
01:18:50,188 --> 01:18:51,708
<i>I know
you're stronger than that.</i>

1477
01:18:51,710 --> 01:18:54,683
<i>My little brother
has the magic gift.</i>

1478
01:18:54,685 --> 01:18:55,972
<i>Don't hold back.</i>

1479
01:18:55,974 --> 01:18:57,792
<i>Hey. You can do this.</i>

1480
01:19:24,338 --> 01:19:27,445
Okay, come on.
Get down right now.

1481
01:19:49,891 --> 01:19:52,272
Yeah! Yeah!

1482
01:19:58,189 --> 01:19:59,477
Barley!

1483
01:19:59,479 --> 01:20:00,965
Ian! Look!

1484
01:20:04,470 --> 01:20:05,692
Behind you!

1485
01:20:08,774 --> 01:20:10,394
It's a curse.

1486
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:04,821
Barley, run!

1487
01:21:08,755 --> 01:21:11,036
What do you want?
The gem?

1488
01:21:12,095 --> 01:21:13,185
Fine, take it!

1489
01:21:17,252 --> 01:21:18,243
Ha-ha!

1490
01:21:38,978 --> 01:21:41,025
The Manticore!

1491
01:21:41,027 --> 01:21:42,183
Mom?

1492
01:21:42,185 --> 01:21:44,397
It's okay, boys,
we'll take care...

1493
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:46,844
Whoa... You're tilting!
You're tilting!

1494
01:21:46,846 --> 01:21:49,092
- Mom!
- Go see your father!

1495
01:21:49,094 --> 01:21:52,035
It's okay! If they stab
the beast's core

1496
01:21:52,037 --> 01:21:54,149
with that sword,
the curse will be broken.

1497
01:21:54,151 --> 01:21:55,408
Come on!

1498
01:22:23,507 --> 01:22:26,414
Barley, what I said before...
I am so sorry.

1499
01:22:26,416 --> 01:22:28,466
There's no time.
The sun's about to set.

1500
01:22:30,250 --> 01:22:32,530
Only once is all we get,
grant me this rebirth.

1501
01:22:32,532 --> 01:22:36,301
Till tomorrow's sun has set,
one day to walk the earth!

1502
01:22:39,375 --> 01:22:41,292
Time to crush a curse!

1503
01:22:48,036 --> 01:22:49,986
Ooh, my back.

1504
01:22:55,243 --> 01:22:56,928
I am a mighty warrior.

1505
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:09,259
I am a mighty warrior!

1506
01:23:15,276 --> 01:23:17,821
Hurry! I can't
hold this for long!

1507
01:23:23,970 --> 01:23:26,151
No! No, no, no! Barley!

1508
01:23:49,953 --> 01:23:51,936
Boys, it's coming back!

1509
01:23:57,233 --> 01:23:58,553
I'll go distract it.

1510
01:23:58,555 --> 01:23:59,678
What? No!

1511
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:01,098
If you do that,
you'll miss Dad.

1512
01:24:01,100 --> 01:24:04,440
It's okay.
Say hi to Dad for me.

1513
01:24:05,796 --> 01:24:08,868
- No. You go and say goodbye.
- What?

1514
01:24:08,870 --> 01:24:11,314
I had someone
who looked out for me.

1515
01:24:11,316 --> 01:24:13,231
Someone who
pushed me to be

1516
01:24:13,233 --> 01:24:15,678
more than I ever
thought I could be.

1517
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:17,465
I never had a dad,

1518
01:24:18,424 --> 01:24:20,274
but I always had you.

1519
01:24:29,234 --> 01:24:30,886
<i>Bridgrigar Invisia!</i>

1520
01:24:32,473 --> 01:24:33,894
<i>Boombastia!</i>

1521
01:24:43,066 --> 01:24:44,321
<i>Aloft Elevar!</i>

1522
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:00,289
No!

1523
01:25:08,091 --> 01:25:09,280
No! No, no, no!

1524
01:25:11,827 --> 01:25:12,683
Use what I have.

1525
01:25:12,685 --> 01:25:15,031
Uh, what do I have?
I have nothing.

1526
01:25:15,033 --> 01:25:17,907
Splinter.
Magic in every fiber.

1527
01:25:17,909 --> 01:25:20,057
<i>Magnora Gantuan!</i>

1528
01:25:21,744 --> 01:25:25,181
No!
<i>Voltar Thundasir!</i>

1529
01:25:31,892 --> 01:25:33,081
Ian!

1530
01:25:33,810 --> 01:25:35,165
<i>Accelior!</i>

1531
01:26:00,355 --> 01:26:01,743
Ian!

1532
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:50,537
What did he say?

1533
01:27:52,057 --> 01:27:55,063
He said he always thought
his wizard name

1534
01:27:55,065 --> 01:27:58,303
would be
Wilden the Whimsical.

1535
01:27:58,305 --> 01:28:01,153
Wow. That's really terrible.

1536
01:28:01,155 --> 01:28:02,906
I know.

1537
01:28:05,387 --> 01:28:08,394
He also said
he's very proud

1538
01:28:08,396 --> 01:28:11,601
of the person
you grew up to be.

1539
01:28:12,494 --> 01:28:16,758
Well, I owe an awful
lot of that to you.

1540
01:28:18,346 --> 01:28:20,891
He kinda
said that, too.

1541
01:28:23,569 --> 01:28:26,841
Oh, and he told me
to give you this.

1542
01:28:55,337 --> 01:28:58,611
<i>Long ago,
the world was full of wonder.</i>

1543
01:29:01,089 --> 01:29:04,459
<i>It was adventurous,
exciting,</i>

1544
01:29:04,461 --> 01:29:07,997
<i>and best of all,
there was magic.</i>

1545
01:29:10,676 --> 01:29:13,285
Whoa! Watch it!

1546
01:29:13,287 --> 01:29:16,294
Bullseye!

1547
01:29:16,296 --> 01:29:18,608
And then, with a slash
of my mighty sword,

1548
01:29:18,610 --> 01:29:21,684
I severed the beast's wings
from its wretched body!

1549
01:29:22,809 --> 01:29:26,079
Okay, who wants cake?

1550
01:29:29,155 --> 01:29:32,228
And I think, with a little
bit of magic in your life,

1551
01:29:32,230 --> 01:29:34,146
you can do
almost anything.

1552
01:29:34,148 --> 01:29:36,394
Is that how you put the
school back together?

1553
01:29:36,396 --> 01:29:37,319
Uh, yes.

1554
01:29:37,321 --> 01:29:38,741
Is that also
how you destroyed

1555
01:29:38,743 --> 01:29:40,228
the school
in the first place?

1556
01:29:40,230 --> 01:29:41,847
Uh, also yes.

1557
01:29:43,603 --> 01:29:45,947
- Hey, that was great.
- Thanks.

1558
01:29:45,949 --> 01:29:48,824
- You going to the park later?
- Yeah! See you there.

1559
01:29:53,434 --> 01:29:55,086
Mom! Oof!

1560
01:29:57,303 --> 01:29:58,556
Blazey, down!

1561
01:29:58,558 --> 01:30:00,507
Who's a good dragon?
Who's a good dragon?

1562
01:30:00,509 --> 01:30:01,895
So, how was school?

1563
01:30:01,897 --> 01:30:03,316
It was really good.

1564
01:30:03,318 --> 01:30:04,474
Well, all right.

1565
01:30:04,476 --> 01:30:06,423
Hey, there he is.
You workin' hard?

1566
01:30:06,425 --> 01:30:08,837
No, hardly workin'.

1567
01:30:08,839 --> 01:30:12,440
Oh, I gotta go. I'm meeting
the Manticore for a night out.

1568
01:30:12,442 --> 01:30:14,292
<i>We got
a one-one-three in progress.</i>

1569
01:30:14,294 --> 01:30:15,515
<i>All units report.</i>

1570
01:30:15,517 --> 01:30:17,763
Duty calls.
Time to hit the trails.

1571
01:30:17,765 --> 01:30:19,086
Oh, you forgot
your keys!

1572
01:30:19,088 --> 01:30:22,656
Don't need 'em.
I was born to run.

1573
01:30:22,658 --> 01:30:23,715
Hyah!

1574
01:30:28,112 --> 01:30:29,302
Oh!

1575
01:30:30,064 --> 01:30:32,277
Ah.

1576
01:30:33,633 --> 01:30:35,052
So, how's
the new van?

1577
01:30:35,054 --> 01:30:37,333
Oh. Guinevere the Second
is great.

1578
01:30:37,335 --> 01:30:40,043
I've almost got enough saved
up for a sweet paint job.

1579
01:30:40,045 --> 01:30:42,192
- No, please don't.
- Why not?

1580
01:30:42,194 --> 01:30:44,740
Because I already
took care of it.

1581
01:30:45,996 --> 01:30:48,278
Oh, yeah!

1582
01:30:49,904 --> 01:30:51,886
Okay, best way
to the park is to take

1583
01:30:51,888 --> 01:30:54,828
a little something
called the Road of Ruin.

1584
01:30:54,830 --> 01:30:57,307
- Uh... It's too obvious.
- Wait, what?

1585
01:30:57,309 --> 01:31:00,418
On a quest, the clear path
is never the right one.

1586
01:31:03,194 --> 01:31:06,334
Oh, yeah!

1587
