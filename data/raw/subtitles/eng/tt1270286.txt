1
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:20,405
Today we come together to remember
the life of Roger Andrew Dawson.

2
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:25,678
Although we know
he had so much life left in him,

3
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:30,186
we thank God for the 17 years we did have.

4
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:39,429
- So, what do you want to do today?
- I figured it out this time.

5
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,492
Man, I hit the gold mine.
We're gonna be rich!

6
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:48,163
- Am I gonna get grounded again?
- Jake, that's a risk I'm willing to take.

7
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,834
- Trick or treat.
- Trick or treat.

8
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:53,674
Boys, it's the middle of July.

9
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:55,737
<i>I love wat you did with your hair.</i>

10
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:02,580
You're crazy, man.

11
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:16,700
And God, we don't always understand why,
and we choose to trust You,

12
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:18,396
even in our pain.

13
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,867
In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

14
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:10,014
Jake.

15
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:14,859
Jake, I'm so sorry.

16
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,226
Oh, Jake.

17
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:25,465
It means a lot that you came. You two...

18
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:33,703
Had you two spoken lately?
Did he say anything?

19
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:53,899
Freshman year, Mrs. Dawson.

20
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:59,798
<i>Starting at guard, averaging 15 points
and 11 assists,</i>

21
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:03,364
<i>the 6' freshman phenom, Jake Taylor!</i>

22
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:19,284
<i>Three-pointer by Jake Taylor!</i>

23
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:38,340
Twenty-two points, 11 assists.
You make us freshmen look good.

24
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:41,841
Thanks.

25
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:45,076
So, why is there a birdie on your bag?

26
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:50,646
It's the mascot for the University of
Louisville. I wanna play there someday.

27
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:54,348
Okay. You going to the party?

28
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:57,621
Yeah. Wait, what party?

29
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:00,323
You're so funny.

30
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,598
We could go together.

31
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:06,728
Here, give me your phone.

32
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:12,802
- Hey, Jake!
- Hey, Rog.

33
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,676
Hey, my friend, Roger,

34
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:20,480
we were gonna hang out tonight.
Is it cool if he comes, too?

35
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:26,186
Our car only has room for one more,
if you know what I mean.

36
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:34,499
Just hold on.

37
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:42,269
Am I seeing things
or were you just talking to Amy Briggs?

38
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,434
Yeah.

39
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:47,002
Well, let's get out of here, man.
Mom already ordered the pizza, so...

40
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,174
Rog, I can't go.

41
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:55,249
Wait, what?
I just talked to you before the game.

42
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:57,448
Amy invited me to a party.

43
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:02,560
Okay. Well, cold pizza's still good.
So, where's the party?

44
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:05,764
You can't go.

45
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,133
I get it.

46
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:18,009
Things are gonna be different now.

47
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:23,241
Roger!

48
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:47,695
Freshman year.

49
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,977
Last time I spoke to him was freshman year.

50
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:48,924
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

51
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:51,128
Where... Where's mine?

52
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:52,796
Why don't you get your girlfriend
to get one for you?

53
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:57,400
- Okay, you know I don't have a girlfriend.
- Hence you have no latte, either.

54
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,411
She got you on that one, dude.

55
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,276
Yeah. You know, your mom got me, okay?

56
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:02,974
She's an attractive woman.
Your mom and l, we get along.

57
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:04,107
I'll talk to you about that later.

58
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:07,016
The Big Ugly has jokes.
Say something funny...

59
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:10,852
All right. Okay, you call me "The Big Ugly"
one more time, I'm gonna kick your ass.

60
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,956
Sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry, dude.
Okay, no hard feelings.

61
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:16,221
You want to get out of here?

62
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:19,196
You know I don't need much
to skip calculus.

63
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:30,698
- Hey, check out that gimp.
- Hey, go by, go by.

64
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:39,615
What's up?

65
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:41,514
Nothing.

66
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,238
Come on.

67
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:14,475
Hey, that's good.

68
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:24,019
Cheers. To us.

69
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:25,555
To us.

70
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:30,995
- To you.
- To me.

71
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,230
To me.

72
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,370
Eighty school days left before you leave
for Louisville.

73
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:43,438
- It's gonna feel like 800 with my folks.
- Stop it. Your mom is not that bad.

74
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:45,814
- Yeah, but my dad won't stop riding me.
- Jake.

75
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:47,477
I mean, you know him.

76
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:49,521
He won't stop trying to live out
his failed dreams through me.

77
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,717
Well, I will go beat him up for you.

78
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:58,791
Look at these guns. You are really strong.
I think you could take him for sure.

79
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:01,264
I am pretty strong.

80
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:04,497
You know what?
I think we should be cool parents.

81
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:07,806
- Who says I want kids?
- I did.

82
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:13,373
That's a good point.
Really, really good point.

83
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,641
Stop! You're making me spill.

84
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,616
Here, I'll take that for you.

85
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:23,747
- You know what? I wrote you a love letter.
- A love letter.

86
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:25,848
Like a love...
Like, you're in love with me letter.

87
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:27,950
- Like, just read it.
- Okay.

88
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,559
Let's check it out.

89
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:40,169
- You got into Louisville?
- Yeah.

90
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:41,831
Early admission.

91
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,939
Well, your big secret's out.

92
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:47,912
Everyone's gonna know
how brilliant you are.

93
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,177
Yeah, well,
I have tried very hard to hide it, so...

94
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:54,852
And we get to be together,
just like we always planned.

95
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,412
Amy Briggs, you are incredible.

96
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:01,758
I love you.

97
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:09,124
My girl is amazing!

98
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:26,009
Louisville's down by two
with 10 seconds to play.

99
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:29,054
Inbound to Taylor.
He brings the ball up court.

100
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:30,145
He's double-teamed as usual.

101
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:36,925
He drives.

102
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:47,537
One, two, three. He shoots! Two, one...

103
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:55,310
Taylor and the University of Louisville
are national champions!

104
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,881
Get down! Get down!

105
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:28,533
Roger.

106
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,942
You don't want to do this, man.

107
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:37,744
It's too late, Jake. Like you ever cared.

108
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:56,226
We're live here at Pacific High School
as students are arriving for the first time

109
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:58,998
in two and a half weeks,
after senior Roger Dawson

110
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:01,437
opened fire in the school,
taking his own life.

111
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:05,806
<i>Security has been heightened here
at the school with a police presence,</i>

112
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:08,244
<i>metal detector searches and ID checks.</i>

113
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,407
<i>Grief counselors are also here on campus.</i>

114
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:13,713
We, of course, will keep you updated
on any late-breaking developments

115
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:15,253
as the story continues to unfold.

116
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:27,759
I was so scared. I mean, did you see him?

117
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,734
He looked so evil.
Like, I thought I was gonna die.

118
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:33,431
- Have you ever seen him before?
- No.

119
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,631
- What up, Jake?
- Hi, Mr. Will.

120
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:06,133
I saw you at the funeral.
I didn't know you were a friend of Roger's.

121
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:10,206
- From a while back.
- You doing okay with this?

122
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:13,473
- Yeah, yeah. It's cool.
- You see a counselor yet?

123
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:15,137
- No.
- You should.

124
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:19,178
- I'm good.
- Think about it.

125
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,764
That kid's just lucky I wasn't there, man.

126
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,027
I was. It wasn't like that.

127
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:40,102
Right. Why are we still talking
about this kid?

128
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:42,140
Okay, that little freak
made us forfeit three games.

129
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:44,437
Will you shut up, man? It was intense.

130
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,741
No. What's intense is
the El Capitan full-court press.

131
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:49,337
That's intense.

132
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:54,385
<i>This last game of the season
with our city rival couldn't be more exciting!</i>

133
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:57,286
<i>Sixteen seconds left.
Jake Taylor brings up the ball.</i>

134
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:59,916
<i>Pacific is down by one, 67-68.</i>

135
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:28,077
<i>Basket by Jake Taylor!
Final score, Pacific, 69, El Capitan, 68.</i>

136
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:52,803
Hey, Jake. Nice shot.

137
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:54,810
Thank you.

138
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:58,113
- Do I know you?
- Roger's funeral.

139
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:03,586
- You're that pastor.
- Yeah. My friends call me Chris.

140
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,793
Anyway, I just wanted to introduce myself.

141
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:13,522
- Cool. I'm not really religious, though.
- Neither am l.

142
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,193
I've been looking everywhere for you.

143
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:19,434
I saw three recruiters tonight
and they were so impressed.

144
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:20,699
Sweet.

145
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:23,071
So, has Doug thanked you
for bailing him out yet?

146
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:26,600
Nope. Hey, Amy, this is Chris.

147
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:29,742
- Hi. Good to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

148
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:33,148
- Everybody's waiting for us.
- Okay.

149
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:37,985
Hey. I know what you're going through,
so if you ever want to talk...

150
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:45,086
All right, kiddo. Let's go see Mama.

151
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:49,400
Who was that?

152
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:52,697
Chris.

153
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:55,430
- Party time?
- Yep.

154
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:12,252
- Bro, reporters finally done with you?
- You know it.

155
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:18,061
You guys have a good time tonight.
I'm getting stupid.

156
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:28,330
Yes! The party has arrived!
Everybody, Jake Taylor's here.

157
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:30,500
Jake Taylor's totally here.

158
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:32,234
Beer?

159
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:34,976
- This is for you, young lady.
- Thank you.

160
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:40,349
Everybody, to Jake.
The man who's always had my back.

161
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:43,081
- Jake!
- Jake!

162
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:50,552
Dude, check that out, man.

163
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:54,964
Wizard Wars?

164
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:59,734
The best part is, there's this nerd at school
who plays this game.

165
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,740
I gave him this flyer
and he swore he'd come.

166
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:06,305
He's gonna show up in Wizard Wars gear.

167
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:10,247
You're crazy, bro. You are. Let's go party!

168
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,613
I'm not, like, clinically insane.

169
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:40,006
You are a lucky man.

170
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,312
Get one of your own.

171
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,884
She's the one everyone wants.

172
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:13,741
What? Are you serious?

173
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:16,747
Everybody, look. Check out this...
Check out this fruitcake.

174
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:20,785
Look, there he is in costume.

175
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:32,593
Man, what level are you?

176
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:34,529
What's wrong with you?

177
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:38,830
You gonna cast a spell on me, man?

178
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:43,698
It's funny. Come on, dance with me.

179
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,989
It's the po-po, y'all.

180
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,857
Get out! Get out!

181
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,897
- Everybody!
- Let's go!

182
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:47,666
Do you hear the police?
Come on, get dressed.

183
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:52,040
- Let's do it again.
- I'm not kidding. Let's go.

184
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,237
- You know you want to.
- Jake.

185
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:58,546
You know what? Screw it.

186
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:02,178
You want to lose your scholarship?
Go ahead, be my guest.

187
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:17,667
- What's your name?
- Tyler.

188
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:18,725
You live here?

189
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:33,114
- That's what she said, man. At least to me.
- Yeah, it was.

190
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:47,524
Where's my truck?

191
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:51,360
Amy?

192
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:11,455
Doug, it's Jake. Where are you?

193
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:13,650
Where am l? Me?

194
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,751
Yeah, I'm here. I'm at the party.
I'm not even talking to you.

195
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:22,229
Amy took my truck. Come get me.
Call me back.

196
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:29,068
Matthew, answer the phone.
Your grandma calls you "Matthew."

197
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:35,138
Hey, it's Jake, and I need a ride.

198
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:36,840
'Cause you guys left.

199
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:40,681
And I'm still here, outside, walking around.

200
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:44,122
Sober up and pick me up.

201
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:49,149
So, text me or call me. Help me.

202
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,274
What the hell?

203
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:17,617
I hate chick flicks.

204
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:20,084
Are you...?

205
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:23,452
Your secret's safe with me,

206
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,627
girly boy.

207
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:29,822
- What? Something flew in my eye.
- Right.

208
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:35,067
- Who's calling at 11:30?
- Hello?

209
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:39,702
Yeah.

210
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:44,707
All right, yeah, I'll be right there.

211
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:49,113
- Where are you going?
- Another drunk kid.

212
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:55,182
Why do I ever get the car detailed?

213
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:59,658
You know what? I'm proud of you.

214
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,765
Hey. Awesome.

215
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:21,942
- Thanks.
- A few too many, huh?

216
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,460
So, Jake, I'm curious.
What did you call me for?

217
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:43,506
Well, my friends ditched me
and my parents would freak out.

218
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:46,569
What about your girlfriend?

219
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:55,047
Speak of the devil.

220
00:25:57,856 --> 00:25:59,517
She took my truck.

221
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:08,822
- Man, it's not your best night, is it?
- I'll drink to that.

222
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:11,268
I mean, yeah.

223
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:19,439
This isn't my house.

224
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,213
Yeah, I know.

225
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:27,647
I don't know,
I just can't stop thinking about him.

226
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,878
He must've been going through hell
and we let him down.

227
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:37,452
<i>Roger came to my youth group once,
the Sunday before.</i>

228
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:42,629
<i>Must've been a last-ditch effort,
but it didn't work.</i>

229
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:44,999
Hold on one second. I'll be right back, okay?

230
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:48,062
- Hey, I'm Chris. How you doing?
- Roger.

231
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:51,233
Good to have you here.
What school do you go to?

232
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:55,509
Hey, one second. Be right back.

233
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:09,384
<i>I missed him.</i>

234
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:20,894
There was this kid at the party tonight,

235
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:27,036
and they wouldn't let him in
because he wasn't... He wasn't cool enough.

236
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:31,771
I mean, how messed up is that?
He wasn't cool enough?

237
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:36,986
The other guys didn't want Roger around,

238
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:41,089
so I just ditched him.

239
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:46,188
They would mess with him, make fun of him,

240
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,635
and I never said a word.

241
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,906
Yeah, I know what you mean, Jake.

242
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:02,301
But somehow we gotta own
how we treated him, you know?

243
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:05,139
You know, I was his only friend.

244
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:10,586
And I would see him every day,
walking to school, in the halls,

245
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:14,815
and I never even said hi.

246
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:25,297
So, we're both living with regrets, huh?

247
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:35,636
Anyway, you live around the corner,
don't you?

248
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:37,339
Yeah.

249
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:47,090
So, what did you mean when you said
that you weren't religious?

250
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:51,186
Well, I'm not religious
'cause that's not what it's about.

251
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:54,095
But aren't you, like, a priest or something?

252
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:58,224
You know, you should come tomorrow.
Just come find out.

253
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:00,938
I don't know about that.

254
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:03,636
Not your thing, huh?

255
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:09,506
Well, neither is leaving my family on a
Saturday night to come pick up a drunk kid.

256
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:14,977
Good morning, sunshine.

257
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:18,448
- How was your trip?
- Sorry we missed your game.

258
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:22,247
I tried to get us back last night,
but Dad had so much work.

259
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,789
Where is he?

260
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:30,686
- I see you were the last-second hero again.
- Yeah, Dad. It was crazy.

261
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:33,253
When Doug shot that ball,
I knew exactly where it was going to go.

262
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,765
One second left, I tipped the ball in,
hit the ground...

263
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,064
You know,
you've got a lot going for you, Jake.

264
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:41,435
Just don't get stupid
with this kamikaze ball, okay?

265
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,565
- Dad...
- Look, I'm just saying...

266
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:48,242
Do you know how easy it would be for you
to get hurt and lose your scholarship?

267
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:52,147
It's not like you're going to get in
any other way, huh? Not with your grades.

268
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:54,685
Just use your head, Son. All right?

269
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:57,243
- lf I'm late, I'll call.
- You working on Sunday?

270
00:30:57,322 --> 00:31:00,951
- You just got home.
- Somebody's got to pay the bills, kid.

271
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,632
What your father means is,
we're proud of you.

272
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:12,568
Yeah, I really felt that
from the one game that he went to.

273
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:16,539
- He's really busy at the office.
- Mom, just stop defending him.

274
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:21,206
- He's just...
- Doesn't get it! It's my life, not his.

275
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:25,475
- Where you going?
- I'm going to church.

276
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:03,986
Had he been there? No.

277
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:06,080
And notice how he prays to God.

278
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:07,419
My favorite part is verse eight.

279
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:10,427
He starts off his prayer
with the word "remember."

280
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:14,595
- Why would he use that word, "remember"?
- Jake Taylor?

281
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:17,125
What are you...

282
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:20,102
- What are you doing here?
- What do you mean?

283
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:22,799
You don't really seem
like the Christian type.

284
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:25,308
I'm just... I'm looking for Chris.

285
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:28,210
He's back here. It's almost over.

286
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:30,605
- So...
- Yeah.

287
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:33,515
Danny. It's so good to see you.

288
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:36,712
Tell your father his sermons just get better
and better every Sunday.

289
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,018
You're gonna be just like him.

290
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:44,153
- Your dad's a priest?
- Yeah, something like that.

291
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:51,501
- Jake, right?
- Yeah.

292
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:58,607
I'm Andrea. Welcome to Souled Out,
and here's a nametag.

293
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:02,968
- What is it, Rainbow Day?
- You didn't get my message?

294
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:07,149
Don't worry, you can borrow this.

295
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:09,847
- Thanks.
- So, here's the deal, guys.

296
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:11,855
We can know all this stuff,

297
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:16,019
and we can go through this book
until mullets come back in style.

298
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:19,291
- That girl freaks me out.
- Until we allow this to go through us

299
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:21,264
and change how we live,

300
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,492
it's a waste of time.
So we always gotta ask ourselves,

301
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:28,630
- "What are we gonna do about it?"
- Jake Taylor.

302
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,739
So I'm gonna wrap this up,
I know you're dying,

303
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:33,174
but I gotta ask you something first.
What would you do for $20?

304
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:36,773
Would you French kiss a dog?

305
00:33:37,915 --> 00:33:39,746
How about this?
Would you take your mom to the prom?

306
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:42,012
I'd take your mom. She's hot.

307
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:45,855
Good, we know what Billy would do.

308
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:48,050
You know, we'd do all kinds of crazy things
for 20 bucks.

309
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:50,560
But what would you do for a penny?

310
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:56,233
Would you take your mom to the prom now?
French kiss that dog?

311
00:33:57,235 --> 00:34:01,069
See, the crazy thing is,
is we treat people the very same way.

312
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:05,973
Some are worth our time and some we just
pass right by like they're worthless.

313
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:11,247
Last week,
I conducted Roger Dawson's funeral.

314
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,917
You know, some of you may not know this,
but Roger came into our youth group

315
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:21,925
the Sunday before he...

316
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,594
You know, it's easy to blame.

317
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:35,965
But last week, Roger took a look at his life
and he said, "I'm not worth it."

318
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:41,507
So whatever he was hoping to find here,
he obviously didn't find it.

319
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,804
Do we get this?

320
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,948
Because if we don't,
the consequences are huge.

321
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:54,454
You don't want to do this, man.

322
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,686
Like you ever cared.

323
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:20,682
Hey, Jake! Hey, man, you made it.

324
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:26,784
- You okay after last night?
- Yeah. Sorry I was late.

325
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:30,755
- No, I'm just stoked you're here.
- Liked your speech.

326
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:36,224
Okay. Thanks, man. I appreciate it.
So, girlfriend still got your truck?

327
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:38,560
Yep.

328
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:42,771
If you got 10 minutes,
I can give you a ride home. Is that cool?

329
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,865
- Sure.
- All right. Come on.

330
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:48,039
Joey! Hey, Michael. Hey, Sarah.

331
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:57,051
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah, of course.

332
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,786
- Why do you think he did it?
- Roger?

333
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:06,889
I've been thinking about that myself.

334
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:11,529
I mean,
if Roger can just kill himself like that,

335
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:16,573
- what does that say about life?
- I don't know.

336
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:21,607
Things like that,
they make you kind of think, don't they?

337
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,271
It's just, like, I've...

338
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:26,145
I've spent my whole life
trying to be some basketball star,

339
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:28,242
and, like, what's the point of that?

340
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:33,188
My dad is successful, but he and my mom,
they're not happy. They hate each other.

341
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:38,553
You know,
at least Roger's not hurting anymore.

342
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:44,095
Yeah. Well, maybe life's a little more
than that.

343
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:48,163
Like what? God?

344
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:52,840
No, I was gonna say...

345
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:58,641
You know, I'd love to finish this
conversation, but I think you got company.

346
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:03,213
Think she saw me?

347
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:08,353
- We'll talk later.
- All right.

348
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:10,189
Good luck out there.

349
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:14,429
Jake, you want to borrow these?

350
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:18,632
- What is it?
- Just check it out.

351
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:36,177
- Hey.
- Hey.

352
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:40,550
Where have you been?
I've called you, like, a bazillion times,

353
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:42,490
and you don't have the decency
to call me back?

354
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,586
I'm sorry, did I miss the part
where you apologized for stealing my truck?

355
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:47,654
You've got to be kidding me.

356
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:50,462
Do you even know
what you put me through?

357
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,759
Say something!

358
00:37:55,172 --> 00:37:57,106
I went to church today.

359
00:37:57,675 --> 00:37:58,767
Yeah?

360
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:03,045
Yeah, my dad did the whole church thing,
and then he left us.

361
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,240
Amy, I'm not your dad.

362
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:06,442
Then what is going on?
Okay, you don't go to church.

363
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:08,280
And who is this guy
that I keep seeing you with?

364
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:09,910
What do you want me to do?

365
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:12,114
You want me to apologize
for you stealing my truck?

366
00:38:12,189 --> 00:38:15,716
- Okay, I'm sorry!
- That's all you've got, is an "I'm sorry"?

367
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,358
Amy, it's just not a good time right now.

368
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:22,923
I've got a lot on my mind.

369
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,325
What? About us?

370
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:30,669
Is that it?

371
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:33,175
You make love to me on Saturdays,
and then you confess on Sundays?

372
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:38,011
- ls that what the new plan's gonna be?
- You don't know what you're talking about.

373
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:39,947
Well, at least I talk.

374
00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:47,549
- You know the kid that killed himself?
- Yeah.

375
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:51,659
I knew him.

376
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:01,066
- It's sad, but seriously, it's not like he...
- Mattered?

377
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:04,665
No. I was gonna say,
it's not like he was your friend.

378
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:07,472
We were best friends.

379
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:11,976
Jake, we've been dating for three years.
I've never even met him.

380
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:13,812
We grew up together.

381
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:19,682
Okay. So, a former friend of yours
tries to shoot up the place and kill people

382
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:21,657
and you feel bad about it?

383
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:24,991
You've got to let it go, okay?
It's not your fault.

384
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:28,631
Then whose fault is it?

385
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:35,034
His. His parents. I don't know. Okay?
But it's not your job to watch over him.

386
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:45,172
But you can watch over me.

387
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:48,684
Just... It's a lot to think about.

388
00:39:49,854 --> 00:39:52,288
I know what you're thinking about.

389
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,527
You think there's a God?

390
00:39:58,095 --> 00:39:59,426
Excuse me?

391
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:02,331
You're acting so weird!

392
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:09,665
Come on, I'll take you home.

393
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:12,476
- Can I have my keys?
- No.

394
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:22,679
<i>Hey there!
Thanks for checking out Devo 2 Go.</i>

395
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:25,688
<i>This is day one of our Life Questions series.</i>

396
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:28,187
<i>You know, God gets blamed
for a lot of things these days.</i>

397
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:31,057
<i>There's all this stuff going on
around the world.</i>

398
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:34,655
<i>We wonder, "Why doesn't He do something?
Why doesn't He stop it?"</i>

399
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:36,199
<i>You know, I really don't know.</i>

400
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:39,964
<i>But I wonder if God ever wants
to ask us the same question.</i>

401
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:51,614
That's the good stuff, right there.

402
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:52,841
Yeah.

403
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:54,882
It's good.

404
00:40:57,288 --> 00:41:00,348
This week is gonna be hell.
So much crap to do.

405
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:03,316
It's like everything sucks right now.

406
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:05,919
- Long time no see.
- Season's over.

407
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:10,159
- No more drug tests.
- Mr. Bee is such an a-hole.

408
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:13,169
It's like he doesn't want us to have a life.

409
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,230
What?

410
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:17,501
Nothing.

411
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:20,135
What does the big preacher man
think about this?

412
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:23,738
He has no clue.
Nothing about smoking weed in the Bible.

413
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:27,244
- What about God?
- You believe that crap?

414
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:31,111
- You don't?
- I believe what I believe.

415
00:41:43,767 --> 00:41:46,565
- Where have you been?
- I got this for you.

416
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:50,670
- Hello? I already have one.
- I just thought...

417
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:52,537
You know.

418
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:55,472
Lukewarm coffee. My favorite.

419
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:01,650
Is that pot?

420
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:04,577
It's not mine.

421
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:22,998
Jake?

422
00:42:25,643 --> 00:42:27,235
- Hey.
- Hey.

423
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:29,909
- Andrea, right?
- Yeah.

424
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:34,117
- How's it going?
- It's all good.

425
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,577
Jake, does anyone ever ask you
how you're really doing?

426
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:44,119
I'm cool. Today didn't really go
how I had planned, so...

427
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:48,524
It was cool to see you at Souled Out.

428
00:42:48,799 --> 00:42:51,393
- You coming tomorrow night?
- Tomorrow?

429
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:55,602
Chris didn't tell you?

430
00:42:55,673 --> 00:42:58,870
Tuesdays are Youth Group.
7:00 p.m. at the church.

431
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:05,377
- You have church two days a week?
- Oh, my gosh, I'm scaring you, huh?

432
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:12,550
I'm sorry. Natalie, Carla, this is Jake.

433
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:15,281
How's it going?

434
00:43:21,165 --> 00:43:24,828
Jake, what's... What's going on, man?

435
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:29,166
- Doug, Andrea, Natalie and...
- Hi.

436
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:31,197
- Carla.
- Carla.

437
00:43:33,877 --> 00:43:35,777
Am I missing something?

438
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:39,408
Actually, Jake and I were just talking about...

439
00:43:39,483 --> 00:43:40,814
Sociology.

440
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:45,880
All right, whatever, man.
Let's get out of here.

441
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:49,249
What are you doing with those girls?

442
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:02,030
Jake?

443
00:44:02,873 --> 00:44:04,966
How long you been out here?

444
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:08,234
The whole time.

445
00:44:09,413 --> 00:44:11,278
Why didn't you come inside?

446
00:44:11,882 --> 00:44:13,349
I don't know.

447
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:15,212
Just...

448
00:44:16,754 --> 00:44:18,221
Not sure.

449
00:44:18,288 --> 00:44:19,653
About what?

450
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:27,590
I believe that you believe,
but why are there so many fakers in there?

451
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:34,195
I know there's fakers in the group, Jake,
but so does God.

452
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,674
I don't know,
I guess there's always gonna be people

453
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:41,336
who are afraid and willing to settle.

454
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:45,646
But, you know, that's not what it's about.

455
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:50,817
- It's about you. What are you gonna do?
- Let's say that I don't want to settle.

456
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,213
Is it worth it?

457
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:59,394
Yeah, I mean, I was asking
a lot of the same questions you are.

458
00:45:00,264 --> 00:45:01,788
You know, but at some point,
you got to ask yourself,

459
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:04,663
"What do you want your life to be about?"

460
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:10,406
I spent a lot of years trying to figure this out,
acting like everything was cool.

461
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:15,972
At a certain point, I just had to answer
that question in my heart.

462
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:19,115
"ls there something more?"

463
00:45:21,085 --> 00:45:22,712
I'm happy enough.

464
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:27,647
Well, it wasn't enough for me, Jake.

465
00:45:30,294 --> 00:45:34,424
If you're really willing to look,
and I don't mean just try it out,

466
00:45:35,532 --> 00:45:40,094
then I'm telling you, Jake, you're gonna find
that He's more than worth it.

467
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:45,007
I'm not just gonna become some Christian.

468
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:48,044
Good. I wouldn't want you to.

469
00:46:15,005 --> 00:46:16,233
What up?

470
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:25,111
- I forgive you.
- That's a nice way to be forgiven.

471
00:46:25,983 --> 00:46:27,974
I called you yesterday.

472
00:46:28,051 --> 00:46:31,214
- Yeah. My cell phone's broken.
- Oh, yes.

473
00:46:31,922 --> 00:46:33,981
You see, now that's what I'm talking about.

474
00:46:34,057 --> 00:46:35,388
- I agree.
- That... I want that one.

475
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:38,053
Jake, dude,
biggest party of the year Friday night.

476
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:42,656
- Yes, beer pong championships, man.
- And you are the man. You got the belt.

477
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:45,031
Yeah, I don't think I can make it.

478
00:46:45,102 --> 00:46:47,730
Right, whatever. Jake Taylor never misses
a party. We'll see you there.

479
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,705
Yeah, he'll be there.

480
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:55,402
Can we just pretend
the last couple of days never happened?

481
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:10,226
Taylor! Yes! Garage, now.

482
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,985
You make it happen. Okay?

483
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:16,393
Garage, you guys?
What are you doing right now?

484
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:19,833
Correct answer? Beer pong!
That's the only answer.

485
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:27,000
All right, everybody,
I want to introduce to you

486
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:29,204
the man with the undefeated record.

487
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,770
The reigning champion, Jake Taylor!

488
00:47:33,817 --> 00:47:35,375
The best. Jake!

489
00:47:35,452 --> 00:47:38,853
- Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake!
- Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake!

490
00:47:38,922 --> 00:47:41,618
All right, all right, you guys, listen up!

491
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:45,150
Yes, the moment we've all been waiting for
has now arrived.

492
00:47:45,262 --> 00:47:48,254
<i>It is time for the clash of the Titans.</i>

493
00:47:48,799 --> 00:47:52,462
<i>It's gonna be a fair fight.
You both know the rules.</i>

494
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:56,870
<i>All right? Let's play beer pong!</i>

495
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:04,980
Show him what you got.

496
00:48:08,785 --> 00:48:09,809
In your face!

497
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:13,482
- Drink it! Drink it! Drink it! Drink it!
- Drink it! Drink it! Drink it! Drink it!

498
00:48:32,943 --> 00:48:34,535
You stink, dude.

499
00:49:04,308 --> 00:49:05,935
He's still going!

500
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:16,642
- Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake!
- Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake!

501
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,685
What are you doing?
Pick that up, we're going to go.

502
00:49:25,762 --> 00:49:27,389
- Jake.
- I'm going.

503
00:49:29,533 --> 00:49:33,867
Jake! Hey, what gives, man?
You were killing that guy.

504
00:49:33,937 --> 00:49:36,906
I'm sorry, man. I just...
I can't do this anymore.

505
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,942
What do you mean you can't do it?
What's wrong with you?

506
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:41,910
- I'm done with this.
- You're done with this?

507
00:49:42,946 --> 00:49:44,348
What the hell, Jake?

508
00:49:44,781 --> 00:49:48,444
- You're a Christian?
- No! I'm just checking things out.

509
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:52,579
- Don't you think you're rushing into this?
- No.

510
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:54,786
I don't know. Maybe.

511
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:59,053
I just... I just know that I need to do this.

512
00:49:59,396 --> 00:50:01,990
Can't you check it out
and still be the same Jake?

513
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:04,863
The same Jake that can throw
a ping pong ball into a keg cup?

514
00:50:04,935 --> 00:50:08,063
What is that?
I don't know if I even like that Jake anyway.

515
00:50:08,138 --> 00:50:11,767
I like that Jake. That's the Jake
that I fell in love with freshman year.

516
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:16,074
Who I got into Louisville for.
Who I've been planning my life around.

517
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:22,883
Is this still about that friend of yours
that killed himself?

518
00:50:22,953 --> 00:50:24,818
Maybe. I don't know.

519
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:28,221
I told you, it's not your fault, okay?
You didn't pull the trigger.

520
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:32,125
Why does everyone keep saying that?
You don't listen to me.

521
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:34,991
I know I didn't kill him. I know I didn't
tell him to shoot up the school.

522
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:37,590
- I know that I didn't do anything.
- Yeah. None of us did.

523
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:39,532
That's the point, Amy.

524
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:41,837
Why didn't l?

525
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:44,702
Jake, you're the captain
of the basketball team.

526
00:50:44,775 --> 00:50:48,370
You're getting ready to graduate.
You have a girlfriend!

527
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:49,844
You're busy.

528
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:55,279
- He saved my life.
- He what?

529
00:50:56,153 --> 00:50:58,644
In sixth grade,
he pushed me out of the way of a car,

530
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,849
and he took the hit himself.

531
00:51:02,125 --> 00:51:04,320
So that's what this is about.

532
00:51:04,761 --> 00:51:06,695
- What?
- He saved your life,

533
00:51:06,763 --> 00:51:09,561
so now you think you owe him
or something?

534
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:14,069
If I didn't ignore him,
do you think that I could've saved him?

535
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:23,138
I don't know. Okay?
But you have to get over this, okay?

536
00:51:23,213 --> 00:51:26,205
There is nothing you can do
to bring him back.

537
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:37,916
I can't believe this is the first time
I'm even hearing this.

538
00:51:37,994 --> 00:51:40,827
I feel like I don't even know you anymore.

539
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:02,274
I feel so alone,

540
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:09,390
Iike I'm the only person in the world
that feels this way,

541
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:11,586
and it doesn't even matter.

542
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:15,158
It's not important. It's not important,

543
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:18,833
maybe because I'm not important.

544
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:23,868
Screaming out,
doing everything in my power to be heard,

545
00:52:24,407 --> 00:52:27,342
yet even silence is louder than my screams.

546
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:32,081
What else can I do to be heard
but to tear down my world,

547
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:33,946
break apart my life?

548
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:36,277
Die.

549
00:52:38,622 --> 00:52:42,524
I just want somebody to listen
and to not be angry that I'm not content,

550
00:52:42,592 --> 00:52:44,219
because I'm not.

551
00:52:45,061 --> 00:52:47,052
You know, I'm not happy.

552
00:52:49,032 --> 00:52:52,559
I feel like I'm stuck in a world
where no one wants me,

553
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:55,233
in a world where I'm so completely different.

554
00:52:55,305 --> 00:52:58,103
I can never fit in or be understood.

555
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:01,667
I can scream as loud as I want to,
but the screams will always fade

556
00:53:01,745 --> 00:53:05,203
because no one really knows how to listen.

557
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:08,012
Well, maybe this will show them.

558
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,619
All right, guys,
I'm gonna need four volunteers.

559
00:53:52,696 --> 00:53:54,721
I got a game
that's gonna test your manhood,

560
00:53:54,798 --> 00:53:58,427
your determination, and just sheer insanity!

561
00:53:58,501 --> 00:54:03,495
All right, I need Mudge, CJ, Matt, Arona,
come on!

562
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:09,242
All right.

563
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:15,850
We're playing to see
who can chug a can of soda, that is,

564
00:54:16,486 --> 00:54:18,579
the fastest. Are you ready?

565
00:54:19,055 --> 00:54:22,354
On your marks, get set...

566
00:54:23,526 --> 00:54:27,087
Wait a minute. I forgot one of the rules.

567
00:54:27,163 --> 00:54:31,429
I need each of you guys to take off
one of your socks and place it over the can.

568
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:36,498
- That's disgusting.
- Come on, like you mean it, guys.

569
00:54:36,573 --> 00:54:38,234
This is gonna taste great.

570
00:54:38,308 --> 00:54:41,744
Come on, don't be shy.
Come on, guys, get it on there.

571
00:54:42,479 --> 00:54:46,347
Yeah! All right. Are you ready?

572
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:50,545
On your marks, get set...

573
00:54:51,655 --> 00:54:54,783
Wait a minute. I almost forgot the last rule.

574
00:54:54,858 --> 00:54:58,760
I need each one of you guys
to pass your can to the guy next to you.

575
00:54:58,828 --> 00:54:59,920
Yeah!

576
00:55:00,897 --> 00:55:03,092
Okay, that's...

577
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:06,329
That's what I mean! Here we go. Go!

578
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:09,665
Oh, no.

579
00:55:12,742 --> 00:55:15,677
Yeah! CJ! We got a winner right here!

580
00:55:16,446 --> 00:55:18,004
Good job, guys.

581
00:55:18,081 --> 00:55:21,073
All right, guys, take your seat
and take your chair with you.

582
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,709
Let's get the band up here!

583
00:55:22,786 --> 00:55:25,755
- Hey. You made it.
- Andrea, this is Amy.

584
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:27,783
I'm really glad you could join us.

585
00:55:27,857 --> 00:55:30,758
Yeah, well,
I told my boyfriend I would check it out, so...

586
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:32,226
That's cool.

587
00:55:33,129 --> 00:55:36,223
I really gotta go. I'm really glad you're here.

588
00:55:46,443 --> 00:55:48,968
The girl on the right is a pot head.

589
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:22,807
This is weird. Let's get out of here.

590
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:25,609
- Why?
- Are you going to drive me home?

591
00:56:26,683 --> 00:56:27,911
Not yet.

592
00:56:29,853 --> 00:56:30,945
Fine.

593
00:56:40,764 --> 00:56:43,528
Amy, wait. Amy, wait.

594
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:46,096
Can't you just take me home?

595
00:56:46,169 --> 00:56:47,397
- No.
- No?

596
00:56:49,973 --> 00:56:51,998
Come on, we just got here.

597
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:55,806
What's really going on with you?

598
00:56:55,879 --> 00:56:58,507
- I'm not gonna let them judge me.
- Who?

599
00:57:01,818 --> 00:57:04,309
Okay, it's either me or them, Jake.

600
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:08,685
Would you please just hang around
for 10 more minutes?

601
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:10,749
I want you to meet Chris.

602
00:57:14,564 --> 00:57:17,499
There's something I gotta talk to you about.

603
00:57:19,002 --> 00:57:22,165
- What is it?
- I don't want to talk about it here.

604
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:25,005
Amy, I'm not gonna fall for that.

605
00:57:28,912 --> 00:57:30,937
You know what? Never mind.

606
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:36,077
Bye.

607
00:57:48,498 --> 00:57:53,265
You know, they did a survey to find out
the places that people least like to be,

608
00:57:53,336 --> 00:57:56,499
and some on the top of the list
were the DMV,

609
00:57:56,573 --> 00:57:58,905
the dentist, the principal's office.

610
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:02,069
But you know
what the number one place was?

611
00:58:03,213 --> 00:58:04,475
Church.

612
00:58:05,682 --> 00:58:08,344
Boring, judgmental, hypocritical.

613
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:14,047
Why is it that so often we can be
the exact opposite of what this teaches?

614
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:18,056
That's not how it's supposed to be, guys.

615
00:58:18,127 --> 00:58:20,027
This is supposed to be a place

616
00:58:20,096 --> 00:58:22,724
where you don't have to pretend
like you've got it all together

617
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:25,131
or that you don't have any problems.

618
00:58:25,201 --> 00:58:29,638
A place where you can come and be who
you really are and not feel judged.

619
00:58:31,274 --> 00:58:34,641
I want to take 30 seconds right now,
30 seconds of silence,

620
00:58:34,711 --> 00:58:37,680
and I want you to ask yourself the question,

621
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:40,342
"Who have I judged?"

622
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:47,414
Hey, did you see the game
last Sunday? Man...

623
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:49,287
And, like, she would not stop texting me.

624
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:52,817
- Do you see that guy there?
- I saw him yesterday...

625
00:58:53,296 --> 00:58:54,957
Yeah, I think they're friends...

626
00:58:59,068 --> 00:59:00,365
Damn it.

627
00:59:03,273 --> 00:59:06,504
Damn it!
Didn't any of you hear what he just said?

628
00:59:08,011 --> 00:59:12,243
My girlfriend came here today,
and she left because she felt judged.

629
00:59:12,515 --> 00:59:14,483
And no one even noticed.

630
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:18,544
Roger walked into school
and started shooting.

631
00:59:19,956 --> 00:59:26,054
I knew him. He wasn't crazy.
And did anyone ever stop and ask why?

632
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:32,231
I mean, how did it get to the point
where his only option was to shoot himself?

633
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:38,666
There are people killing themselves
and you're chugging soda through a sock.

634
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:42,175
I mean,

635
00:59:42,946 --> 00:59:47,383
what's the point of all of this
if you're not going to let this change you?

636
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:53,214
What do you think we should do, Jake?

637
00:59:54,357 --> 00:59:55,824
I don't know.

638
00:59:58,861 --> 01:00:01,659
We could all hang out together at school.

639
01:00:02,532 --> 01:00:03,726
Loser.

640
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:10,406
That's a good idea.

641
01:00:10,473 --> 01:00:13,636
Hey, why don't we all have lunch together
in the quad?

642
01:00:20,583 --> 01:00:21,982
Hey, Jake.

643
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,444
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

644
01:00:27,523 --> 01:00:31,892
Mom said you went to church again.
That's twice this week, isn't it?

645
01:00:33,763 --> 01:00:36,357
Yeah, the other time was Youth Group.

646
01:00:37,734 --> 01:00:41,693
Yeah, I got nothing against a little religion,
but you sure you have time for this?

647
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:45,805
- Time?
- Yeah, it's your senior year, you know.

648
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:49,242
Louisville could still take your scholarship
away if your grades are bad.

649
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:51,212
- You been hitting the books?
- Yeah.

650
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,578
You better. You don't want to be a slacker.

651
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:55,208
You want to be successful,
you gotta work hard.

652
01:00:55,284 --> 01:00:57,309
It's what separates the good from the great.

653
01:00:57,387 --> 01:01:00,550
You got your whole life ahead of you now.
Don't screw it up.

654
01:01:00,623 --> 01:01:04,582
Relax, Dad. I won't disappoint you.

655
01:01:09,365 --> 01:01:10,764
Good talk.

656
01:01:22,278 --> 01:01:26,772
- Think anybody's gonna show?
- Yeah. Maybe.

657
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:30,550
Guys, sorry I'm late.

658
01:01:31,821 --> 01:01:33,550
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

659
01:01:35,124 --> 01:01:37,183
- Hi, I'm here.
- So glad it's finally lunch.

660
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:39,922
- What are you eating today?
- Hey, man.

661
01:02:51,067 --> 01:02:52,193
Hey.

662
01:02:54,637 --> 01:02:55,661
Hey.

663
01:02:56,906 --> 01:02:58,806
Me and some friends
are having lunch over there,

664
01:02:58,875 --> 01:03:01,469
just seeing if you want to join us.

665
01:03:04,247 --> 01:03:08,445
Yeah, I gotta study for a test, so... Sorry.

666
01:03:09,152 --> 01:03:13,816
Okay. Just wanted to say hi. I'm Jake Taylor.

667
01:03:16,325 --> 01:03:17,792
Jonny Garcia.

668
01:03:28,604 --> 01:03:32,335
Hey, you're friends with Roger, right?

669
01:03:37,847 --> 01:03:41,544
- Hi. I'm Andrea.
- This is my new friend, Jonny.

670
01:03:42,084 --> 01:03:45,417
Hey. So, are you gonna join us?

671
01:03:46,255 --> 01:03:50,885
- He's got homework.
- Yeah, I got a test I have to study for, so...

672
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:53,624
Well, we'll be here every day.

673
01:03:56,199 --> 01:03:57,894
See you later, Jonny.

674
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:16,579
Come on!

675
01:04:19,822 --> 01:04:23,121
- What the hell?
- Are you allowed to say "hell," Jake?

676
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:25,891
What's your deal, man?
I'm just trying to work out.

677
01:04:25,962 --> 01:04:27,327
Sure you got time to work out?

678
01:04:27,396 --> 01:04:30,991
You don't have to get to some secret
Christian club meeting or something?

679
01:04:31,067 --> 01:04:33,627
- What do you care, Doug?
- Ever since you've gotten religious,

680
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:35,534
you don't have any time
for your friends, man.

681
01:04:35,605 --> 01:04:39,939
- I've invited you to lunch with us every day.
- "Us." You see what you're doing? "Us"?

682
01:04:40,009 --> 01:04:43,240
Jake, you and I have been best friends
since sixth-grade soccer, okay?

683
01:04:43,312 --> 01:04:46,611
And it's always been about you, all right?
Jake, the MVP. Jake, the prom king.

684
01:04:46,682 --> 01:04:48,274
You know it's true.

685
01:04:48,351 --> 01:04:51,286
Hey, guess who's banging Amy
tonight, buddy?

686
01:04:52,688 --> 01:04:55,714
She's using you, man.
She would never do that.

687
01:04:56,192 --> 01:04:58,660
- She's too good for you.
- Think so?

688
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:03,588
- Keep walking, Taylor!
- Chill! Chill!

689
01:05:13,376 --> 01:05:14,502
Hey!

690
01:05:17,213 --> 01:05:20,376
Jonny. Hey, man, need a lift?

691
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:23,715
You don't have to do this, man.

692
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:25,748
Come on.

693
01:05:27,523 --> 01:05:28,717
Get in.

694
01:05:38,968 --> 01:05:44,907
I was on Roger's page
and I saw you on there.

695
01:05:47,043 --> 01:05:48,943
Were you guys friends?

696
01:05:51,247 --> 01:05:56,651
Yeah. We played video games a lot.
Not in person. Just, you know, online.

697
01:06:00,056 --> 01:06:03,992
Did you know that he was gonna...
You know?

698
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:11,998
Look, I didn't think he was serious.

699
01:06:13,002 --> 01:06:14,526
You knew?

700
01:06:15,504 --> 01:06:18,302
Yeah, I just saw some stuff he wrote online.
That's it.

701
01:06:18,374 --> 01:06:21,172
- And you didn't tell anyone?
- No, I didn't... I don't know.

702
01:06:21,243 --> 01:06:24,110
I swear, I didn't think he was serious.

703
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:28,914
Look, I'm sorry.

704
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:35,347
I'm not mad at you.
I just want to know what happened.

705
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:45,797
You ever think like Roger did?

706
01:06:47,403 --> 01:06:51,100
What, that I'm gonna shoot up a school? No.

707
01:06:51,741 --> 01:06:54,608
- I didn't mean that.
- I'm not Roger, okay?

708
01:06:55,144 --> 01:06:57,112
Right here on the right.

709
01:07:08,624 --> 01:07:10,649
Said you like video games?

710
01:07:12,595 --> 01:07:14,324
Got any good ones?

711
01:07:46,095 --> 01:07:48,154
Hey, man. Did you hear Chris got in trouble?

712
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:49,663
For what?

713
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:52,758
For that time you were cussing at church.
That was awesome, man.

714
01:07:52,835 --> 01:07:55,360
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, I'm serious.

715
01:07:56,338 --> 01:07:59,637
- He never said anything to me about it.
- Well, of course not.

716
01:07:59,708 --> 01:08:04,236
Star athlete like you coming to our church?
He doesn't wanna mess that up.

717
01:08:05,214 --> 01:08:07,307
What are you talking about?

718
01:08:08,317 --> 01:08:11,445
I've seen it before.
I mean, that's how these guys work.

719
01:08:14,824 --> 01:08:16,314
Whatever, man.

720
01:08:37,446 --> 01:08:39,107
No homework today?

721
01:08:41,083 --> 01:08:42,380
Come on.

722
01:10:15,578 --> 01:10:19,674
Okay, so you can forget everybody's name,
except for this guy.

723
01:10:20,182 --> 01:10:23,015
- Chris, Jonny.
- Nice to meet you, Jonny.

724
01:10:23,085 --> 01:10:28,079
Hey, Jonny. Come with me.
I want you to meet some people.

725
01:10:28,157 --> 01:10:29,624
Go have fun.

726
01:10:30,426 --> 01:10:34,920
I don't know how you did it, man.
This place is different because of you.

727
01:10:35,864 --> 01:10:39,527
Hey, you know earlier
when I cussed in front of everybody?

728
01:10:40,002 --> 01:10:44,268
- Did I get you in trouble?
- Jake, I've been doing this a long time,

729
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:46,831
and that was the coolest thing
I've ever seen.

730
01:10:47,443 --> 01:10:49,240
Don't worry about me.

731
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:58,216
Do you think cartoon characters
go to heaven?

732
01:10:58,287 --> 01:11:01,279
Bro, what's it like in there?

733
01:11:03,859 --> 01:11:08,455
Okay, speaking of that,
did you have fun today?

734
01:11:09,965 --> 01:11:11,364
Yeah, I did.

735
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:18,605
I just normally don't like
big groups of people. That's all.

736
01:11:22,077 --> 01:11:23,237
Hey...

737
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:29,110
I was just wondering.
How often do girls shave their legs?

738
01:11:30,252 --> 01:11:33,619
- What?
- Just always wondering.

739
01:11:33,689 --> 01:11:36,385
It just kind of depends on the girl.

740
01:11:37,593 --> 01:11:39,527
That's what I figured.

741
01:11:40,829 --> 01:11:42,126
You're so cute.

742
01:11:49,071 --> 01:11:51,505
- We are not done talking.
- Why are you always bringing this stuff up

743
01:11:51,573 --> 01:11:53,302
when I'm getting ready to go to a meeting?

744
01:11:53,375 --> 01:11:56,572
- Another meeting? At 9:00 p.m.?
- Don't you dare accuse me of that

745
01:11:56,645 --> 01:11:59,375
while I'm out there
working every day for you!

746
01:11:59,448 --> 01:12:01,746
I don't have time to talk about this!
You've made me late already!

747
01:12:01,817 --> 01:12:04,581
Don't you dare walk out that door!

748
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:10,682
Been home long?

749
01:12:16,198 --> 01:12:19,634
- So you heard all that?
- I've been hearing all that.

750
01:12:19,702 --> 01:12:22,500
It's nothing.
Your mother is just overreacting.

751
01:12:22,571 --> 01:12:25,540
It's okay, Jake.
It's just a little misunderstanding.

752
01:12:25,607 --> 01:12:26,801
Yeah.

753
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:30,038
So, don't worry about us,
just worry about yourself.

754
01:12:30,112 --> 01:12:32,012
It's not worth it, Dad.

755
01:13:26,468 --> 01:13:30,768
- Hi, Mrs. Dawson.
- Jacob. You don't have to do that.

756
01:13:32,374 --> 01:13:33,841
I don't mind.

757
01:13:34,309 --> 01:13:37,642
Okay, well,
at least come in and have some cookies.

758
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:40,710
- Still got that sweet tooth?
- Sure do.

759
01:13:51,026 --> 01:13:54,962
That cast. That was his badge of honor.

760
01:14:00,035 --> 01:14:03,835
Why don't you take that one?
I know Roger would like that.

761
01:14:06,775 --> 01:14:08,436
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

762
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:26,851
Thanks for the pictures.

763
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:30,057
Jake, thank you.
I've missed having you around.

764
01:14:37,539 --> 01:14:42,636
Mrs. Dawson, I'm really sorry
that I wasn't a better friend to Roger.

765
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:46,978
- I didn't know.
- None of us did.

766
01:14:49,418 --> 01:14:51,283
And I was his mother.

767
01:14:52,955 --> 01:14:54,479
He was my son.

768
01:15:57,152 --> 01:15:58,881
That's really funny.

769
01:16:05,193 --> 01:16:08,390
Have you ever asked a girl out before?

770
01:16:08,463 --> 01:16:10,328
- Like on a date?
- Yeah.

771
01:16:10,599 --> 01:16:11,759
Yeah.

772
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,163
- You think Andrea would go out with me?
- Andrea?

773
01:16:16,438 --> 01:16:18,269
You have a game plan?

774
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:20,735
- A game plan?
- It's the best part.

775
01:16:20,809 --> 01:16:23,209
If you can make a girl feel
like a million bucks,

776
01:16:23,278 --> 01:16:25,940
she will be like putty in your hands.

777
01:16:28,183 --> 01:16:29,172
Well...

778
01:16:29,484 --> 01:16:33,818
- Are you gonna be there when I ask her?
- Absolutely not.

779
01:17:07,155 --> 01:17:08,850
- Hey.
- Hey.

780
01:17:12,628 --> 01:17:15,096
Now that we've broken the "ice,"

781
01:17:18,867 --> 01:17:22,997
I was wondering
if you would like to go out with me tonight.

782
01:17:23,739 --> 01:17:26,367
How sweet. Of course.

783
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:29,870
Cool.

784
01:17:58,106 --> 01:18:02,736
I've never heard of anyone bringing
their own toppings to an ice cream shop.

785
01:18:02,811 --> 01:18:04,802
I really like bacon bits.

786
01:18:06,314 --> 01:18:07,906
- You want to try some?
- Thanks.

787
01:18:07,983 --> 01:18:09,382
- You sure?
- No.

788
01:18:09,451 --> 01:18:11,282
They're really good.

789
01:18:20,328 --> 01:18:22,193
I used to be a cutter.

790
01:18:24,566 --> 01:18:25,658
You?

791
01:18:26,802 --> 01:18:30,932
My parents got divorced in eighth grade
and I thought it was my fault.

792
01:18:33,742 --> 01:18:35,767
It was before I met God.

793
01:18:39,748 --> 01:18:42,342
Scars are supposed to heal, you know.

794
01:18:50,926 --> 01:18:52,359
Jonny, l...

795
01:18:53,161 --> 01:18:55,220
I'm sorry. Let me just...

796
01:18:58,166 --> 01:18:59,565
I'm sorry.

797
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:02,961
No, it's okay.

798
01:19:49,751 --> 01:19:52,879
- You okay?
- I missed you at the party.

799
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:58,353
- I haven't been to one in over a month.
- I know.

800
01:20:00,262 --> 01:20:01,786
Where's Doug?

801
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:05,324
He's probably at the party
passed out somewhere.

802
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:07,197
I stole his Jeep.

803
01:20:14,176 --> 01:20:16,371
Jake, I gotta tell you something.

804
01:20:19,581 --> 01:20:21,048
I'm pregnant.

805
01:20:24,119 --> 01:20:28,146
I don't know what to... Are you sure?

806
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:33,118
Yeah. I missed my period,
I took four home tests.

807
01:20:33,195 --> 01:20:34,787
I'm sure.

808
01:20:36,464 --> 01:20:37,692
It's yours.

809
01:20:40,068 --> 01:20:43,162
- What about Doug?
- We never...

810
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:48,040
Wow. Does your mom know?

811
01:20:48,109 --> 01:20:50,873
She would kill me.
She was my age when she had me

812
01:20:50,946 --> 01:20:54,279
and I can't even tell you how many times
she warned me to be careful.

813
01:20:56,918 --> 01:21:00,718
- Wow.
- Yes, you said that already. Okay?

814
01:21:00,789 --> 01:21:04,885
You know, look,
I know this is too much for us to handle.

815
01:21:06,895 --> 01:21:09,693
I've decided not to keep the baby.

816
01:21:09,764 --> 01:21:13,700
- I just wanted you to know.
- That's it?

817
01:21:14,002 --> 01:21:16,869
Jake, I grew up without a dad.
I'm not gonna allow...

818
01:21:16,938 --> 01:21:19,133
- lsn't this a decision that we should make?
- "We"?

819
01:21:19,207 --> 01:21:21,539
Jake, you leave for Louisville in five months!

820
01:21:21,610 --> 01:21:24,374
- But I thought that...
- No, Jake, I am not having the baby.

821
01:21:24,446 --> 01:21:27,415
- But this is my...
- No, it's not your choice!

822
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:31,413
I just think that we should talk about this.

823
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:36,123
- Jake, it's my body. My future.
- I know.

824
01:21:37,192 --> 01:21:39,023
I just don't want you to rush into this.

825
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:42,959
You know what would happen to me
if I kept it?

826
01:21:43,331 --> 01:21:44,457
What?

827
01:21:44,532 --> 01:21:47,433
Have you seen somebody pregnant?
It's kind of hard to hide.

828
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:54,638
- What about the baby?
- Great. Make me feel worse than I already do.

829
01:21:55,043 --> 01:21:58,206
You know, I thought this whole religious
thing would make you more sympathetic.

830
01:21:58,280 --> 01:21:59,713
I was wrong.

831
01:22:00,815 --> 01:22:03,648
- Wait!
- Just stay away from me, Jake!

832
01:22:04,452 --> 01:22:07,546
Amy, come on. Can we talk?

833
01:22:37,352 --> 01:22:39,252
Mom, what's wrong?

834
01:22:45,327 --> 01:22:47,887
What happened? Where are you going?

835
01:22:50,398 --> 01:22:52,298
I'll be at Aunt Judy's.

836
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:05,038
Dad, what did you do to Mom?

837
01:23:07,115 --> 01:23:10,084
- She's pretty mad, huh?
- No, what did you do?

838
01:23:16,358 --> 01:23:19,293
Jake, your mother caught me
with another woman.

839
01:23:20,261 --> 01:23:23,230
- She what?
- She wants me to leave.

840
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:26,528
What is wrong with you?

841
01:23:29,037 --> 01:23:32,234
It's a two-way street, you know?
It's not just me.

842
01:23:32,941 --> 01:23:36,502
But it's over.
We decided to end it a long time ago.

843
01:23:36,578 --> 01:23:41,106
- I tried to tell her, but...
- You are unbelievable, you know that?

844
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:44,512
I'm done with you.

845
01:24:30,865 --> 01:24:32,059
Jake.

846
01:24:35,503 --> 01:24:36,629
Jake.

847
01:24:43,178 --> 01:24:46,477
I got huge problems, man. It's Andrea.

848
01:24:46,548 --> 01:24:50,985
I totally screwed up last night.
I kind of tried to kiss her.

849
01:24:51,052 --> 01:24:55,318
I mean, she grabbed my hand
and I thought...

850
01:24:56,057 --> 01:24:59,254
I don't know, man. I'm an idiot.
What should I do?

851
01:25:01,062 --> 01:25:03,963
- Whatever.
- "Whatever"?

852
01:25:04,566 --> 01:25:08,366
"Whatever"? Jake, this is huge.
I just blew my one chance!

853
01:25:08,436 --> 01:25:10,063
Help me out, man.

854
01:25:10,872 --> 01:25:12,931
What's up with you today?

855
01:25:15,210 --> 01:25:18,805
You want to know what's wrong?
Doesn't matter if you screwed up,

856
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:22,941
doesn't matter if she likes you,
doesn't matter if she ever talks to you again.

857
01:25:23,017 --> 01:25:26,578
- What are you saying?
- Dude, I guess she doesn't like you.

858
01:25:26,654 --> 01:25:28,986
It wouldn't have worked anyways.

859
01:25:30,859 --> 01:25:34,056
- You suck as a friend, man.
- Yeah, I suck!

860
01:25:34,496 --> 01:25:37,488
That's why I picked you up,
that's why I'm always defending you,

861
01:25:37,565 --> 01:25:41,331
that's why I never told anyone
about your little problem.

862
01:25:43,671 --> 01:25:48,040
I don't need you, man. I never needed you.

863
01:25:49,110 --> 01:25:51,578
I was fine before you ever bothered me.

864
01:26:09,564 --> 01:26:11,896
Well, at least you're finding out now.

865
01:26:12,767 --> 01:26:14,257
What?

866
01:26:14,536 --> 01:26:17,403
Chris just told him to be nice to you.

867
01:26:17,472 --> 01:26:21,738
You were kind of like his project.
Guess he failed that one.

868
01:26:23,578 --> 01:26:25,773
Didn't know you were an artist.

869
01:26:31,419 --> 01:26:34,582
- I'm in trouble.
- What's going on?

870
01:26:34,656 --> 01:26:38,023
Well, my parents are getting a divorce.

871
01:26:39,661 --> 01:26:42,596
Jake, I'm so sorry.

872
01:26:43,798 --> 01:26:46,130
And Amy

873
01:26:47,635 --> 01:26:48,863
is pregnant.

874
01:26:55,343 --> 01:26:59,473
- How's she doing?
- She wants to get rid of it.

875
01:27:00,949 --> 01:27:03,679
- Has she made up her mind?
- I don't know.

876
01:27:03,952 --> 01:27:07,581
I honestly don't know what to do.
She won't even talk to me.

877
01:27:07,655 --> 01:27:12,149
She needs to know that she won't be alone,
that you'll be there for her.

878
01:27:13,394 --> 01:27:16,591
I've dreamt my entire life
of going to Louisville.

879
01:27:16,965 --> 01:27:18,398
She knows that.

880
01:27:18,466 --> 01:27:21,333
You think she dreamed of
getting pregnant at 18?

881
01:27:24,439 --> 01:27:26,839
Have you prayed about this, Jake?

882
01:27:28,209 --> 01:27:31,076
God? I don't want to talk about Him.

883
01:27:31,145 --> 01:27:34,308
- Well, God didn't do this to you.
- Well, He didn't stop it!

884
01:27:35,216 --> 01:27:37,081
I mean, here I am. I'm going to church,

885
01:27:37,151 --> 01:27:39,915
reading my Bible, all of that crap,
and this is what I get?

886
01:27:40,321 --> 01:27:43,984
- He's not punishing you, Jake.
- Well, it sure feels like it.

887
01:27:44,058 --> 01:27:49,997
My whole life is falling apart.
This is not working. It's not worth it.

888
01:27:51,132 --> 01:27:55,592
Listen, God is not some little genie,
or a vending machine.

889
01:27:55,670 --> 01:27:58,639
And it's not just worth it
because He makes your life all better.

890
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:00,940
But He's with you.

891
01:28:01,175 --> 01:28:03,666
Then why is my life falling apart?

892
01:28:04,379 --> 01:28:08,406
Well, maybe it always was
and you're just now starting to care.

893
01:28:09,317 --> 01:28:11,251
- My life was fine.
- Jake,

894
01:28:11,919 --> 01:28:15,582
God wants so much more for your life
than fine.

895
01:28:16,324 --> 01:28:18,952
- Like what?
- I don't know, I'm not God.

896
01:28:20,194 --> 01:28:22,389
But you just gotta trust Him through this.

897
01:28:27,669 --> 01:28:29,193
I don't know, man.

898
01:28:31,472 --> 01:28:33,736
Look, I'm here for you, no matter what.

899
01:28:33,808 --> 01:28:36,936
But you and I both know
where those other roads lead.

900
01:28:37,312 --> 01:28:39,872
You gotta decide for yourself.

901
01:29:43,578 --> 01:29:47,844
God, I don't know if I'm allowed
to be mad at You, but I am.

902
01:29:49,917 --> 01:29:54,980
All this has happened to me,
and I'm trying my best to do the right thing,

903
01:29:55,056 --> 01:29:58,423
and everything around me
just keeps getting worse.

904
01:30:00,161 --> 01:30:02,493
Chris told me that I could ask You for help.

905
01:30:02,563 --> 01:30:06,431
I don't even know what that is,
but I know that I need it.

906
01:30:09,170 --> 01:30:11,661
I don't have anywhere else to turn.

907
01:30:16,210 --> 01:30:19,202
All I know is that I can't do this by myself.

908
01:30:25,553 --> 01:30:27,043
God, please,

909
01:30:30,191 --> 01:30:33,126
just give me the strength to do what's right.

910
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:33,283
- What do you want?
- Amy, I gotta see you.

911
01:31:34,021 --> 01:31:37,980
- I can't do this right now. What is it?
- I gotta tell you in person.

912
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:41,328
- I've already decided.
- What?

913
01:31:42,430 --> 01:31:45,126
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm fine. Jake, just...

914
01:31:45,199 --> 01:31:47,099
Amy, where are you?

915
01:31:47,168 --> 01:31:52,367
- I'm at some coffee shop at the Plaza.
- The Plaza?

916
01:31:57,612 --> 01:31:58,840
Amy?

917
01:32:34,815 --> 01:32:37,375
Amy! What's wrong?

918
01:32:38,452 --> 01:32:40,443
What do you want from me?

919
01:32:41,289 --> 01:32:44,281
I woke up this morning and I had this feeling
I needed to talk to you.

920
01:32:44,358 --> 01:32:47,293
I'm so sorry about the way I reacted
the other day.

921
01:32:47,361 --> 01:32:49,488
And I don't know what it's like to be you.

922
01:32:49,564 --> 01:32:52,499
- And there I was, making it worse.
- Stop, okay?

923
01:32:53,067 --> 01:32:55,592
- I can't do it.
- I know.

924
01:32:56,437 --> 01:32:59,133
- We can.
- You're leaving!

925
01:33:00,441 --> 01:33:02,102
Don't move.

926
01:33:14,522 --> 01:33:16,854
I can't let you do that, Jake,
that's your dream.

927
01:33:16,924 --> 01:33:20,485
- It's my choice.
- You don't even know what you're doing.

928
01:33:20,561 --> 01:33:22,654
Amy, I do.

929
01:33:25,499 --> 01:33:26,898
I can't be pregnant.

930
01:33:28,369 --> 01:33:32,203
You've spent your whole life
trying to get people to like you.

931
01:33:35,910 --> 01:33:38,242
I would lose everything, though.

932
01:33:40,247 --> 01:33:42,340
You wouldn't lose me.

933
01:33:46,087 --> 01:33:47,952
I'm so scared.

934
01:33:50,057 --> 01:33:53,857
- I'm not ready to be a mom.
- Neither am l.

935
01:33:55,062 --> 01:33:59,431
- What?
- I mean a dad. I'm not ready to be a dad.

936
01:34:01,869 --> 01:34:05,896
I'm here for you no matter what,
whatever it is you decide.

937
01:34:06,874 --> 01:34:09,775
Okay. I'll think about it.

938
01:34:11,646 --> 01:34:13,443
No promises, though.

939
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:35,091
- What are you doing with him?
- I was cleaning your room and I found...

940
01:34:35,169 --> 01:34:37,262
What's the meaning of this?

941
01:34:38,906 --> 01:34:41,101
- I'm not going.
- Excuse me?

942
01:34:41,609 --> 01:34:45,306
- I've changed my mind.
- Really? Well, when did this happen?

943
01:34:46,881 --> 01:34:50,180
- It's complicated.
- Jake, this is not the way to get back at me.

944
01:34:50,251 --> 01:34:51,445
It has nothing to do with you!

945
01:34:51,519 --> 01:34:54,079
Do you have any idea how many guys
would kill for an opportunity like this?

946
01:34:54,155 --> 01:34:55,417
Like you?

947
01:34:56,257 --> 01:35:00,023
Son, just think for a second.
This scholarship is all you've got.

948
01:35:01,796 --> 01:35:05,232
- Not anymore.
- Honey, I thought this was your dream.

949
01:35:05,299 --> 01:35:06,891
What's going on?

950
01:35:08,736 --> 01:35:10,966
- I can't go.
- Why can't you?

951
01:35:11,906 --> 01:35:14,704
- Amy.
- What about Amy, honey?

952
01:35:23,517 --> 01:35:25,849
- What?
- Amy's pregnant.

953
01:35:26,854 --> 01:35:29,152
Tell me you're joking.

954
01:35:30,725 --> 01:35:35,458
- Jake, she can't force you to stay here.
- lt was not like that, all right? It's my choice.

955
01:35:35,529 --> 01:35:39,397
- So, you're choosing to ruin your life!
- I guess you would know.

956
01:35:43,938 --> 01:35:45,565
It's your future.

957
01:35:57,551 --> 01:36:00,748
I heard your date with Jonny was interesting.

958
01:36:00,821 --> 01:36:03,051
Yeah, it was a little awkward.

959
01:36:03,557 --> 01:36:05,582
Have you seen him lately?

960
01:36:06,160 --> 01:36:09,254
No, I've called him,
but he hasn't called back.

961
01:36:10,598 --> 01:36:13,260
I'll just... I'm gonna call him again.

962
01:36:19,206 --> 01:36:21,640
Jonny, hey, it's Jake.

963
01:36:22,743 --> 01:36:26,543
I'm here with Andrea
and we're just wondering where you've been.

964
01:36:27,615 --> 01:36:31,244
I want to talk to you about something,
so give me a call.

965
01:36:50,471 --> 01:36:54,373
- Okay, I just need to grab one thing.
- But we're always the last to leave.

966
01:36:54,441 --> 01:36:56,238
Hang in there, tiger.

967
01:37:03,050 --> 01:37:04,449
So, the sock game with the sodas,

968
01:37:04,518 --> 01:37:07,817
that was probably the most disgusting thing
I've ever seen.

969
01:37:07,888 --> 01:37:11,984
I know. I read that in a book about
how to get fired as a youth pastor.

970
01:37:12,059 --> 01:37:13,083
Nice.

971
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:16,857
- So, how you holding up?
- I'm never having sex again.

972
01:37:18,699 --> 01:37:20,860
You can't say that.
You're gonna make your wife miserable.

973
01:37:22,536 --> 01:37:24,504
- Have you guys talked?
- Yeah.

974
01:37:25,372 --> 01:37:28,705
- I think Amy's keeping the baby.
- Good.

975
01:37:30,778 --> 01:37:34,339
- Do your parents know?
- My mom cried.

976
01:37:34,715 --> 01:37:37,479
As if she needed anything else.

977
01:37:37,551 --> 01:37:41,214
- What about your dad?
- I don't really care what he thinks anymore.

978
01:37:43,157 --> 01:37:46,718
Listen, I wanna run something by
you and Amy.

979
01:37:47,328 --> 01:37:50,197
Maybe we can get together again
sometime soon.

980
01:37:57,972 --> 01:37:59,371
Is it true?

981
01:38:04,311 --> 01:38:06,575
You are such a slut!

982
01:38:09,216 --> 01:38:10,410
Really.

983
01:38:10,684 --> 01:38:13,278
What's going on? You okay?

984
01:38:16,090 --> 01:38:18,991
- Where'd you get that?
- You tell me, Jake.

985
01:38:19,460 --> 01:38:22,452
- It's not like that.
- I always knew she was a slut.

986
01:38:22,730 --> 01:38:24,630
Don't you call her a slut!

987
01:38:25,232 --> 01:38:26,494
Or what?

988
01:38:27,534 --> 01:38:28,899
Or what?

989
01:38:30,204 --> 01:38:34,436
Don't call her what, Jake?
That's what she is, man. She's a slut.

990
01:38:34,508 --> 01:38:38,342
And you've got your little Jesus lunch group
doing everything you want them to.

991
01:38:38,412 --> 01:38:43,577
And you're the biggest faker of them all,
man. And nobody, nobody is fooled.

992
01:38:44,485 --> 01:38:46,316
You're not worth it.

993
01:39:39,473 --> 01:39:44,103
Circle's over here, Taylor.
We're a little smaller today.

994
01:39:45,779 --> 01:39:50,113
- Don't tell me you don't know.
- We know.

995
01:39:51,986 --> 01:39:55,251
Well, I'll see you later.

996
01:39:56,323 --> 01:39:59,918
Jake, it really doesn't matter.

997
01:40:01,228 --> 01:40:03,594
Besides, like, who am I to judge?

998
01:40:03,998 --> 01:40:07,263
- Well, for one, you're, like, perfect.
- No.

999
01:40:07,768 --> 01:40:11,101
I'm not perfect. If you only knew the dirt.

1000
01:40:11,705 --> 01:40:15,072
- Whatever.
- There's different kinds of dirt.

1001
01:40:17,611 --> 01:40:20,512
- How could you let this happen?
- Amy.

1002
01:40:21,448 --> 01:40:24,611
- I'm so sorry.
- I told you, everybody hates me.

1003
01:40:24,685 --> 01:40:26,312
They don't.

1004
01:40:28,389 --> 01:40:29,879
It'll be okay.

1005
01:40:32,159 --> 01:40:33,490
What?

1006
01:40:39,666 --> 01:40:42,794
- Thank you.
- Got a whole pack if you want them.

1007
01:40:44,304 --> 01:40:46,534
Why are you being so nice to me?

1008
01:40:47,541 --> 01:40:49,008
I don't know.

1009
01:40:49,910 --> 01:40:53,641
I guess I just know what it feels like
to be alone. Sucks, huh?

1010
01:40:56,517 --> 01:40:59,315
So, are you guys gonna join us for lunch,
or what?

1011
01:41:02,556 --> 01:41:03,784
Sure.

1012
01:41:11,098 --> 01:41:13,089
I was deeply disturbed to hear from my son

1013
01:41:13,167 --> 01:41:16,466
that one of your students
got his girlfriend pregnant.

1014
01:41:16,537 --> 01:41:18,528
Where did Danny hear this?

1015
01:41:18,605 --> 01:41:21,233
He overheard you two
outside your office last night.

1016
01:41:21,308 --> 01:41:25,677
- Mark, your son has no right...
- You're right, but he did and now I know.

1017
01:41:27,047 --> 01:41:30,175
I'm just not comfortable
having this kid being around here.

1018
01:41:30,617 --> 01:41:34,212
You're not comfortable?
Look, Mark, I'm telling you,

1019
01:41:34,288 --> 01:41:37,223
half the time I don't know
if these kids listen to a thing I say.

1020
01:41:37,291 --> 01:41:41,091
But this kid, he's getting it.
I can see it happening.

1021
01:41:41,161 --> 01:41:42,992
But it's a fragile time for him, you know?

1022
01:41:43,063 --> 01:41:47,090
You judge this kid, but you haven't even
bothered to get to know him.

1023
01:41:47,167 --> 01:41:49,032
You don't even know
what's going on in his life.

1024
01:41:49,103 --> 01:41:52,004
Jake Taylor should be teaching us
what it means to follow God.

1025
01:41:57,878 --> 01:41:59,846
I wanna give you guys
a chance to respond tonight.

1026
01:41:59,913 --> 01:42:04,282
And I know that some of you guys
came here tonight feeling totally alone.

1027
01:42:13,093 --> 01:42:14,856
Maybe some of you are here

1028
01:42:14,928 --> 01:42:17,488
and you're hurting for someone else.

1029
01:42:18,298 --> 01:42:20,789
You know what your response is?

1030
01:42:21,168 --> 01:42:23,830
Show them God's unconditional love.

1031
01:42:26,206 --> 01:42:29,004
And let me tell you,
it's not always gonna be easy,

1032
01:42:29,643 --> 01:42:31,338
but don't give up.

1033
01:42:41,288 --> 01:42:43,119
"Everything around me is falling apart.

1034
01:42:43,190 --> 01:42:45,158
"Maybe if I were gone
everything could be fixed.

1035
01:42:45,225 --> 01:42:48,353
"Why would anyone even care
if I were gone?

1036
01:42:48,929 --> 01:42:51,591
"Maybe this is just how life is.
Maybe it'll only get worse.

1037
01:42:51,665 --> 01:42:53,895
"I don't think life really wants me, either. "

1038
01:43:35,676 --> 01:43:40,670
- Those teachers are freaking out.
- I know, this is weird. I think it's serious.

1039
01:43:40,747 --> 01:43:42,339
I need the quad locked down.

1040
01:43:42,416 --> 01:43:44,816
Nobody leaves
until we know what's going on.

1041
01:43:45,953 --> 01:43:47,181
What's going on here?

1042
01:43:48,822 --> 01:43:53,225
All right, everybody, listen up.
This is not a drill. This is real.

1043
01:43:53,293 --> 01:43:57,889
We've got a bomb threat here today.
The police are inside searching the building.

1044
01:43:57,965 --> 01:44:03,562
You're staying here until I say otherwise.
Anyone who tries to leave will be expelled.

1045
01:44:03,637 --> 01:44:06,936
This is no joke. Especially at this school.

1046
01:44:07,674 --> 01:44:11,576
Now, if anyone has information
that might be helpful, you need to tell me.

1047
01:44:12,179 --> 01:44:14,204
- Do you know anything?
- Has anybody seen anything?

1048
01:44:17,851 --> 01:44:22,345
I bumped into this kid earlier,
and I don't know where he is, but...

1049
01:44:22,422 --> 01:44:24,185
- Go with him.
- Okay.

1050
01:44:24,258 --> 01:44:25,657
- All right?
- Okay.

1051
01:44:25,726 --> 01:44:28,024
- Thank you.
- All right, okay.

1052
01:44:42,609 --> 01:44:44,440
Does the name match his cell phone?

1053
01:44:46,346 --> 01:44:47,813
10-4, I think we have our suspect.

1054
01:44:48,815 --> 01:44:51,943
- Do you know a Jonny Garcia?
- Jonny Garcia?

1055
01:44:52,219 --> 01:44:54,084
Can you tell me where he is?

1056
01:44:59,926 --> 01:45:01,154
You've got to be kidding me.

1057
01:45:03,163 --> 01:45:05,154
Hey, Jonny's here.

1058
01:45:05,232 --> 01:45:08,099
Jonny Garcia. Stand up, please.

1059
01:45:09,569 --> 01:45:12,299
Okay, take your backpack off,
hand it to my partner.

1060
01:45:12,372 --> 01:45:14,363
I have to take a look at your cell phone.

1061
01:45:20,314 --> 01:45:22,509
- I don't have it.
- No? You have to come with us.

1062
01:45:46,907 --> 01:45:48,374
You don't want to do this, man.

1063
01:45:48,442 --> 01:45:52,003
It's too late, Jake. Like you ever cared.

1064
01:45:59,886 --> 01:46:03,413
That doesn't surprise me. It's always
the quiet freaks who pull this stuff.

1065
01:46:03,623 --> 01:46:05,113
I told you.

1066
01:46:23,744 --> 01:46:27,908
- He didn't do it. We gotta help him.
- Jake, you'll get expelled.

1067
01:46:37,791 --> 01:46:39,520
I've got an idea.

1068
01:46:50,237 --> 01:46:54,071
- Ladies, what's going on?
- I'm really not feeling too well.

1069
01:46:54,508 --> 01:46:56,738
My friend, she needs help. She's pregnant.

1070
01:46:58,845 --> 01:47:01,245
Jake? Jake!

1071
01:47:36,450 --> 01:47:38,418
- Let me go, Clyde!
- This is not cool, Jake!

1072
01:47:38,485 --> 01:47:40,214
I gotta make things right!

1073
01:47:44,257 --> 01:47:47,818
- Stop! Put your hands up!
- He didn't do it, but I know who did.

1074
01:47:52,899 --> 01:47:54,890
Things are different now.

1075
01:48:10,750 --> 01:48:14,914
- Why'd you bring him?
- Why am I here and not your dad?

1076
01:48:15,922 --> 01:48:19,323
Chris, just get me out of here, okay?
I didn't do anything wrong.

1077
01:48:23,864 --> 01:48:24,990
Where are you going?

1078
01:48:25,966 --> 01:48:27,957
Well, it doesn't sound like
you did anything wrong.

1079
01:48:28,869 --> 01:48:34,501
Look, it wasn't my fault, okay?
Somebody set me up. I don't deserve this.

1080
01:48:34,574 --> 01:48:38,567
They found you with his phone, Danny!
You're not fooling anybody.

1081
01:48:40,747 --> 01:48:42,772
You can't leave me here.

1082
01:48:44,651 --> 01:48:46,516
I'm not gonna leave you here.

1083
01:48:46,586 --> 01:48:47,746
They're gonna take you downtown

1084
01:48:47,821 --> 01:48:50,790
until your dad can find some time to
come pick you up.

1085
01:48:52,392 --> 01:48:53,654
It's up to you, Jake.

1086
01:48:54,194 --> 01:48:56,856
You can't do this. I'll get you fired!

1087
01:48:57,931 --> 01:49:00,491
Well, what do you want me to say?
What, that I screwed up?

1088
01:49:00,967 --> 01:49:04,164
You know what? Screw you! Okay?
Who needs you? I don't!

1089
01:49:04,671 --> 01:49:08,107
Okay, okay. It was an accident, okay?
I panicked!

1090
01:49:08,608 --> 01:49:12,066
I didn't know! But I'm sorry! I'm sorry, okay?

1091
01:49:21,521 --> 01:49:22,886
I'll stay.

1092
01:49:24,457 --> 01:49:26,357
Why are you doing this?

1093
01:49:27,527 --> 01:49:28,960
I'm not sure.

1094
01:49:50,050 --> 01:49:51,244
Sorry.

1095
01:50:47,974 --> 01:50:51,808
Frank and Jan are really amazing people.
They're long-time friends of ours,

1096
01:50:51,878 --> 01:50:55,143
and they've been dying to meet you guys
ever since I told them.

1097
01:50:55,215 --> 01:50:58,514
They're also really excited
about an open adoption.

1098
01:51:00,654 --> 01:51:03,919
- You sure you wanna do this?
- Yeah.

1099
01:51:04,624 --> 01:51:05,716
Okay.

1100
01:51:07,560 --> 01:51:08,993
Come on in.

1101
01:51:14,467 --> 01:51:17,265
- This is Jan and her husband, Frank.
- Hi.

1102
01:51:18,405 --> 01:51:20,839
- This is for you.
- What?

1103
01:51:21,441 --> 01:51:25,309
It's just a little something to
show our gratitude for...

1104
01:51:26,146 --> 01:51:27,704
For your amazing gift.

1105
01:51:31,217 --> 01:51:34,015
We want to keep you a part of the family.

1106
01:51:37,390 --> 01:51:38,516
It's good to meet you both.

1107
01:51:38,591 --> 01:51:42,254
- It's so nice to finally meet you.
- Thanks for doing this.

1108
01:51:46,766 --> 01:51:48,597
Life is a journey.

1109
01:51:49,235 --> 01:51:52,830
Not so much to a destination,
but a transformation.

1110
01:51:54,274 --> 01:51:58,142
You know, looking back, doesn't it
sometimes feel like our richest times

1111
01:51:58,211 --> 01:52:00,907
come right in the midst of our hardest?

1112
01:52:01,881 --> 01:52:06,909
But God made us to live in community,
to laugh and cry,

1113
01:52:06,986 --> 01:52:11,320
to hurt and celebrate with each other
no matter what we're going through.

1114
01:52:11,391 --> 01:52:13,325
And transformation is tough.

1115
01:52:14,194 --> 01:52:16,754
We don't always end up
where we think we will.

1116
01:52:17,130 --> 01:52:21,499
But we have to remember that
even when we struggle to believe in Him,

1117
01:52:22,736 --> 01:52:24,761
He always believes in us.

1118
01:52:26,005 --> 01:52:30,567
He fills our life with purpose and passion,
if we just let Him.

1119
01:52:33,747 --> 01:52:39,185
And, you know, the best part of the journey
is that the God of the universe

1120
01:52:39,252 --> 01:52:43,916
sometimes allows us
to play a part in changing the world.

1121
01:52:45,024 --> 01:52:46,685
Isn't that a trip?

1122
01:52:55,769 --> 01:52:57,634
It took an extra semester, but you made it.

1123
01:52:59,239 --> 01:53:01,673
I'm so proud of you, Jake.

1124
01:53:02,242 --> 01:53:04,073
- Love you, Mom.
- Good.

1125
01:53:04,444 --> 01:53:07,379
- Then don't be mad at me.
- For what?

1126
01:53:10,583 --> 01:53:14,075
Jake, no matter what, he's your dad.

1127
01:53:22,395 --> 01:53:27,094
I'll pay for the gas if you got an open seat.

1128
01:53:30,770 --> 01:53:31,828
Okay.

1129
01:53:43,950 --> 01:53:46,077
Tell your mom I'll miss her.

1130
01:53:49,589 --> 01:53:51,113
Hey, I got...

1131
01:53:52,592 --> 01:53:53,991
It's for you, bro.

1132
01:54:03,570 --> 01:54:05,868
Thank you so much for staying with me.

1133
01:54:06,739 --> 01:54:08,366
I wish you were coming.

1134
01:54:08,441 --> 01:54:12,241
Yeah, I just gotta make sure
it's my dream, too, you know?

1135
01:54:12,812 --> 01:54:14,370
We'll figure it out.

1136
01:54:18,985 --> 01:54:20,612
Call me tonight.

1137
01:54:24,490 --> 01:54:26,355
- I'll call you.
- Okay.

1138
01:54:42,375 --> 01:54:47,108
"Dear Jake, I wanted to say this in person,
but it's weird.

1139
01:54:47,747 --> 01:54:52,343
"Remember that time that you asked me
if I had ever felt the way Roger did?

1140
01:54:52,418 --> 01:54:57,082
"I said I didn't, but I lied.

1141
01:54:58,191 --> 01:55:01,251
"I thought about taking my life all the time.

1142
01:55:02,862 --> 01:55:06,059
"I even wrote the letter
explaining why to my mom.

1143
01:55:07,967 --> 01:55:12,995
"Then out of nowhere you came up
and invited me to eat with you guys.

1144
01:55:14,073 --> 01:55:17,975
"I don't know where I'd be
if you hadn't done that.

1145
01:55:19,646 --> 01:55:21,876
"I just wanted to say thank you. "
