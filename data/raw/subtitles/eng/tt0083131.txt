1
00:00:24,724 --> 00:00:26,214
This is the army.

2
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,462
It's learning how to be
a soldier...

3
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,361
and how to be much more.

4
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,966
It's cold streams
that chill your bones...

5
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,668
and a hot meal
to warm you up.

6
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:45,267
It's softball and low bridges.

7
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:48,143
It's a hundred ways
to prove yourself.

8
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:50,205
If you'd like to be part of it...

9
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:52,410
call this number toll free.

10
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:59,353
That's my philosophy. A hundred-dollar
shine on a three-dollar pair of boots.

11
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:01,018
Yes, sir.

12
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:06,161
I don't think I've ever
been this happy. Huh?

13
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,169
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

14
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:21,136
I got a nice, warm cab right here.

15
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:22,738
You sure?

16
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:25,512
- Let's go. He said it.
- Hey, come on, man.

17
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:49,741
Thanks for the ride, pal.

18
00:01:57,016 --> 00:01:58,779
Shit!

19
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:03,587
I thought that was
a dog around your neck.

20
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:06,124
It that's humor, don't bother.

21
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:09,161
I want to be taken to the airport,
and be very carefuI with the bags.

22
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,197
Don't scratch them.

23
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,129
Allow me.

24
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,792
Thank you.

25
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,415
Would you be carefuI with those!

26
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:41,892
Madam, perhaps you'd like
to eat your luggage.

27
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:43,258
I'm in a hurry.

28
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:51,592
Oh! Oh, my balls.

29
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:10,622
Good morning.

30
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,783
This is basic English.

31
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:18,197
My name is Russell Ziskey...

32
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:21,097
and I'm gonna be your instructor
for the next five weeks.

33
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:24,830
I want you to call me Russell and I'm
going to call you by your first names...

34
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:29,341
because I would have a pretty tough time
pronouncing some of your last names.

35
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:38,039
Okay, I know you're anxious to jump
right in and start speaking English...

36
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:41,177
but there are just a couple of things
I need to know first because...

37
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,119
I've never done this before.

38
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:47,683
How many of you would say you speak
English well, but with some difficulty?

39
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,991
A little English?

40
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,861
You speak some English?

41
00:03:58,271 --> 00:03:59,932
Son of bitch. Shit.

42
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:12,751
I've never gone this way before.

43
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:16,311
I'm sure there's a lot of ways
I've gone that you haven't.

44
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,857
What is your name?

45
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:22,224
John Ringer? What kind
of a name is Ringer?

46
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:24,855
Winger. I'm adopted.

47
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,695
I spent most of my life
in institutions.

48
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:31,794
Doesn't surprise me. You look like
a typical lowlife character to me.

49
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:41,442
Actually, I'm a photographer.
I took this job because I love people.

50
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:44,847
There's nothing that I enjoy more than
meeting someone like yourself...

51
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:48,375
and getting to know you, then taking a
few action photos of you while I drive.

52
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,685
Stop! Turn around! Watch the road!
Stop with the pictures!

53
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:55,285
Thank you so much.

54
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,460
Aren't you going too fast?

55
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:00,658
No, it's not the speed
really so much.

56
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:03,361
I just wish I hadn't drunk
all that cough syrup this morning.

57
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:04,698
Oh, my!

58
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:10,940
- We're going to be killed!
- Oh, no!

59
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,639
- Keep on the wheel and slow down!
- Not killed!

60
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:30,425
You should have your license
taken away.

61
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:34,759
I am going to write
your name down...

62
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:40,369
and see that it's given
to the proper authorities.

63
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,066
You're a bum!

64
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:46,771
And that's all you'll ever be,
a bum!

65
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:51,374
Well, that hurts, ma'am.

66
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:55,715
And I don't think
I want to take your abuse.

67
00:05:55,788 --> 00:06:00,282
I know I don't want to take you and your
luggage to the airport. How 'bout that?

68
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:11,796
Hey, move that cab, buddy!

69
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:18,474
You can't stop
in the middle of a bridge!

70
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,645
Would you get back in the car!

71
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:35,083
That's really very good.
I'd like to try one more time...

72
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:37,595
and then we'll call it a day.

73
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:40,860
I met her on a Monday
and my heart stood still

74
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:44,528
Da doo run run run
Da doo run run

75
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:47,402
Somebody told me
that her name was Jill

76
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:50,704
Da doo run run run
Da doo run run

77
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:53,769
Okay, great, great.
We'll see you next week.

78
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:55,814
We'll learn some new tunes.
We'll have a great time.

79
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:59,215
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

80
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:03,681
One of these days everything
that I want's gonna be mine

81
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:07,385
But if it ain't that
it'll be all right

82
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,985
As long as there's sunshine

83
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:11,996
And a big old brew

84
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,070
That's my car!

85
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:22,936
- Hey, man!
- Instant Finance.

86
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:25,204
You're late on the payments, pal.

87
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,907
It's me.

88
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:04,511
- John, is that you?
- No.

89
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:06,916
Did you remember to get my dress?

90
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,419
Yeah.

91
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,726
Hi, baby. You're home
a little early, aren't you?

92
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,888
- Yeah.
- How was your day?

93
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:19,727
Fine.

94
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,733
I got your pizza too.

95
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:41,686
I had a real bad day.

96
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:44,279
Yeah. I bet you did.

97
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,468
I quit my job.

98
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:02,006
I just can't take this anymore.

99
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:05,202
I know. I gotta straighten out.

100
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,473
- This is ridiculous.
- Right.

101
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,708
That's what you said last week.

102
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:12,444
How much can you
straighten out in one week?

103
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:16,181
It hasn't been a week, John.
It's been six months.

104
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:18,120
And nothing's changed.

105
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,648
You sleep in till noon,
then you watch Rocky and Bullwinkle.

106
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,127
Then you drive your cab, what,
a couple hours?

107
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:26,391
You come home,
you order out food...

108
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:30,026
and then you play those stupid Tito
Puente albums until 2:00 in the morning!

109
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:32,332
Tito Puente is gonna be dead,
and you're gonna say...

110
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,499
"I've been listening to him for years
and I think he's fabulous."

111
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:40,512
Then you watch movies until dawn,
and then you come to bed with me.

112
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,414
You don't think that takes energy?
You're a sexual dynamo.

113
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:46,246
Most guys couldn't even
handle you.

114
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:49,720
I've been reading books on the outside
so I can keep up with you.

115
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,381
It's not funny.

116
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,693
You're going nowhere, John.

117
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:59,057
It's just not that cute anymore.

118
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:07,032
It's a little cute.

119
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:12,407
Come on. I'm part of a lost
and restless generation.

120
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:14,673
You want me to run
for the senate?

121
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,908
I don't know what I want.

122
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:19,884
I just know
that I don't want you.

123
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:26,053
So, the basic problem is
that I'm still around?

124
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:30,286
Where's that sharp knife
we have? Anita!

125
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,592
I need you.

126
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:38,798
Come on.

127
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:41,704
I knew that wasn't
gonna sound good.

128
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,639
No, it's not gonna work.
I like you, but I need something more.

129
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:51,979
I need somebody who's gonna
develop with me and grow. Good-bye.

130
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:56,044
Who could grow more than me? Talk
about massive potential for growth...

131
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,989
I am the little acorn
that becomes the oak.

132
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:01,993
You can't go!
All the plants are gonna die!

133
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:12,699
And then depression set in.

134
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,416
Go away.

135
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,962
Hi.

136
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:41,699
What's the matter with you?

137
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:44,835
Nothing.

138
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:48,264
Nice shot.

139
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:54,812
Need a little help.

140
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,815
Can I take your last beer?

141
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,475
We'll split it.

142
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:06,389
I've had an interesting morning.

143
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:09,087
In the last two hours...

144
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:13,097
I've lost my job, my apartment...

145
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:15,827
my car and my girlfriend.

146
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,425
You still have your health.

147
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,545
Hey. Yes, thank you.
Toss that up here.

148
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,881
Yo. Here we are, my man.

149
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:35,512
All right, come to papa.
Toss that thing. Let's go.

150
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,223
Geez.

151
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:41,823
Thank you.

152
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:44,988
The army can make you feel
a lot of ways:

153
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:47,658
tired, challenged, trained.

154
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:49,667
This doesn't look bad.

155
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,195
What, the army?

156
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,672
You're kidding.

157
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:58,539
I've always thought
about joining the army.

158
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,875
Bullshit. You're not the type.

159
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:06,211
What do you mean
I'm not the type?

160
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,720
I've seen the kind of guys
that enlist in the army.

161
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,883
I saw them when I was working on
unemployment. They're like us.

162
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,483
Except they're not as sophisticated.

163
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,586
Yeah, they're not as old either.

164
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:20,291
I bet you can't do five push-ups.

165
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,129
Five push-ups?

166
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:26,327
I got three dollars
says I can do tive push-ups.

167
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:28,896
Okay, let's go. Five good ones.
Come on.

168
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:32,701
- Not marine push-ups.
- Simple push-ups.

169
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:39,249
I've never heard bones
creak like that.

170
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:42,845
That's none.

171
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:45,322
- I'm praying.
- You ought to.

172
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,825
Let's go.
There's a time limit here.

173
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:52,395
He's almost set.
He's eyeing that rug.

174
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,359
And that's one.
All right. He's off.

175
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:59,836
He's moving.
That's two.

176
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:01,600
Not that good though.

177
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:08,107
That's three.

178
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,740
I think you're ready
for the Special Olympics.

179
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:13,918
That's three.

180
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:15,510
- That's four.
- Four.

181
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:17,579
I was testing you.

182
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:20,124
And here goes five?
Will he do it?

183
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,793
Congratulations.
You just doubled your money.

184
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:32,503
I gotta get in shape.

185
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,800
I gotta dry out,
or I'll be dead before I'm 30.

186
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,844
The army's my only chance.

187
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,846
You could join a monastery.

188
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,507
Did you ever see a monk get
wildly fucked by some teenage girls?

189
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:50,783
- Never.
- So much for the monastery.

190
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:05,528
You comin' in?

191
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,714
Hey, this is a loading zone.
You can't park here.

192
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:23,220
We're not parking it.
We're abandoning it.

193
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:26,122
I can't believe we're doing this.

194
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:29,126
Listen, if I get killed,
my blood is on your hands.

195
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:32,459
- Just don't get it on my shoes, okay?
- Hello.

196
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:36,126
I'm not saying that the army will be
able to do for you what it did for me.

197
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:39,932
All I'm saying is you get out of it
exactly what you put into it.

198
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:43,566
Now, sometimes the army's
your best shot.

199
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:47,339
There's some questions I have to ask.
They're a little personal.

200
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:50,678
Have you ever been convicted
of a felony or a misdemeanor?

201
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:54,048
That's robbery, rape, car theft,
that sort of thing?

202
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,950
- Convicted?
- Yeah.

203
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:58,080
- No.
- Never convicted.

204
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,592
That's good.

205
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,391
Are either of you homosexuals?

206
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,004
You mean like flaming or--

207
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:17,008
Well, it's a standard question
we have to ask.

208
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:20,101
We're not homosexual,
but we are willing to learn.

209
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:23,913
Would they send us
someplace special?

210
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:29,284
I guess that's no on both.

211
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:33,121
All right, now if you'll just give
Uncle Sam your autograph here.

212
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:38,161
"Sammy, get well soon."

213
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,164
That's good. Now your name.

214
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,462
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

215
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,038
I was wondering if you, uh--

216
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:32,743
Are you, uh, you know, holding?

217
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:35,013
No, man, I'm not.

218
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:38,147
Well, I was wondering if you could
hold something for me.

219
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,282
Are you smuggling furs
or something?

220
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:44,792
Drugs.

221
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,958
Excuse me. General Hansen?

222
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:52,060
No, I'm not a general,
but may I help you?

223
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:55,231
Yes. I want to thank you
for saving my life over in Vietnam.

224
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:58,868
- I don't think that was me.
- You're right. It was Normandy Beach.

225
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:01,469
I was shot up pretty bad.

226
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:04,744
You grabbed me, pulled me into a foxhole
and patched me up. I appreciate it.

227
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:07,809
I don't think so and don't care
and don't have the time.

228
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:10,548
- See this arm band? MP.
- Yes, ma'am.

229
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:14,183
Stands for military police.
Are you on one of these buses?

230
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,954
Not yet, ma'am.

231
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:19,361
My job is to see that
big, strong men like you...

232
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,831
get on these buses
without getting lost.

233
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,028
So why don't you just move along
and get on the bus.

234
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,628
Could you check him off?

235
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:30,266
You know, there's a strip search
before you get on the bus.

236
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:32,902
- Really?
- Yeah. Be careful, man.

237
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:39,309
So, I guess we dig each other...

238
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:42,911
and we'll be seeing each other
around the officers' club?

239
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,585
Watch out for this guy.
He's a troublemaker.

240
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:55,764
- Do you have your papers?
- Yes. Here.

241
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:01,199
What happens if I refuse
to get on the bus?

242
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:04,174
You look like
a sensitive, intelligent guy.

243
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,403
Don't make me shoot you.

244
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,777
Climb aboard, soldier.

245
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:25,288
- What do you think?
- I hope we don't go to war.

246
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:29,130
Excuse me, stewardess.
Is there a movie on this flight?

247
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,691
Bus.

248
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:25,247
Inside. Off the bus.

249
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:28,225
Off the bus.
Right on inside.

250
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:29,920
Move it out.

251
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:42,464
Sergeant Hulka.

252
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:44,866
Yes, sir?

253
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:53,546
At ease, Sergeant.

254
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:57,020
I'm Captain Stillman,
the new company commander.

255
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,387
Pleased to meet you, sir.

256
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,892
Fine-looking group of men,
wouldn't you say so?

257
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:05,925
I hope this is the mess hall.

258
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:07,932
How's it going, Eisenhower?

259
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,730
Yes, sir, a fine-looking
bunch ot men.

260
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:16,740
Yes, well. Get 'em inside.

261
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,705
Carry on, I guess.

262
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,178
I'll be in my office
if you need me.

263
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:23,680
Yes, sir.

264
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:33,958
Have that removed, corporal.

265
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:41,767
Men, welcome to
the United States Army.

266
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:45,794
Men, welcome to
the United States Army.

267
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:48,066
I'm Sergeant Hulka.

268
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,608
I'm your drill sergeant.

269
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:53,201
Before we proceed any further...

270
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:55,212
we gotta get something straight.

271
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:02,720
Your mamas are not here
to take care of you now.

272
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:09,354
It's just you, me and Uncle Sam.

273
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:13,496
And before I leave you...

274
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:17,797
you're gonna find out that
me and Uncle Sam are one in the same.

275
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:20,064
Uncle Hulka?

276
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:25,175
When I tell you to move...

277
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:27,768
you'll move fast.

278
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,314
When I tell you to jump...

279
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:32,316
you're gonna say, "How high?"

280
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:36,449
And make no mistake.

281
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,752
I don't care where you come from,
what color you are...

282
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:44,853
how smart you are, how dumb you are
'cause I'm gonna teach all of you...

283
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,421
how to eat, sleep...

284
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:52,129
walk, taIk, shoot, shit
like a United States soldier.

285
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:58,008
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.

286
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:04,138
I didn't hear you.

287
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,207
Yes, sir.

288
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:09,549
You don't say sir to me.
I'm a sergeant. I work for a living.

289
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:13,113
- Yes, sergeant.
- I didn't hear you.

290
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:16,359
Now that's what I wanna hear.

291
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:18,828
You think this guy's
overdoing it a bit?

292
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:26,232
You got a problem, boy?

293
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:28,864
No problem, Sergeant.

294
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,965
On your feet, boy.

295
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,075
What's your problem, boy?

296
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:39,583
I was just making a joke, Sergeant.

297
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,013
Why don't you tell me your joke?

298
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:48,423
I don't think you'd think
it's funny, sir. Sergeant.

299
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:50,484
How do you know?

300
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:53,395
I got a hell of a sense of humor.
Ain't I, Corporal Briggs?

301
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:54,898
Yes, Sergeant!

302
00:23:57,402 --> 00:24:00,132
We have a comedian in our midst.

303
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:04,332
Will you take
this comedian outside...

304
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:06,673
and watch him do 50 push-ups.

305
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:09,145
Get your goat-smelling ass
out of here!

306
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:12,879
Move it!

307
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,418
Hut, ho, hut!

308
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,221
Anybody else want to be
a comedian in here?

309
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,884
- No, Sergeant.
- I didn't hear you!

310
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:28,652
Hare Krishna

311
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:31,423
Shut up! Shut up, will you!

312
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:33,862
- I didn't mean it.
- How come yours is so long?

313
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:35,866
Fifteen and a half.

314
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:39,402
Thirty three.

315
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:41,972
Forty two.

316
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,065
- Thirty seven.
- Thirty seven?

317
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:45,973
Step down. Grab your papers.

318
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:49,536
These are thirty-fours
and they're loose.

319
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:53,510
I gotta live with thirty seven?

320
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:02,585
Sir, I'm very sorry
about what happened at the meeting.

321
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:07,064
I certainly meant no offense by it.
It won't happen again.

322
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:09,066
Keep it moving! Let's go!

323
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,599
Think he bought it?

324
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:19,533
Boxer or jockey?

325
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:22,808
You got something in a low-rise bikini?
Mesh, if possible?

326
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:27,209
So, where you from, Tex?

327
00:26:27,285 --> 00:26:30,448
Don't you ever touch me again, ever.

328
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:35,419
This is pretty sweet.
Free clothing.

329
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:38,985
Look at this stuff. Chicks in New York
paying top dollar for this garbage.

330
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:41,498
How 'bout that lunch?
What was that brown stuff?

331
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:48,830
All right, men, fall in alongside
this roadway in a column of two.

332
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:50,966
Fall in!

333
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:52,373
Move it!

334
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,211
Hi.

335
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:03,315
You know something, soldier.
I've noticed you're always last.

336
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:05,322
I'm pacing myself, Sergeant.

337
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:12,791
Sorry.

338
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:14,957
Left, face!

339
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:19,429
Left, right, left, right.

340
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:21,872
You stand in place.

341
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:28,312
Forward, march!

342
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,975
Hey, we're walkin'.

343
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:53,693
There she was just a walkin'
down the street singin'

344
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:57,606
Doo wah ditty
ditty dum ditty doo

345
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:01,476
Popping her fingers
and shuffling her feet singin'

346
00:28:01,546 --> 00:28:04,743
Doo wah ditty
ditty dum ditty doo

347
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:06,681
- She looked good
- She looked good

348
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:08,582
- She looked fine
- She looked fine

349
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:12,749
She looked good, she looked fine
and I nearly lost my mind

350
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:16,658
Before I knew it she was
walkin' next to me singin'

351
00:28:20,565 --> 00:28:24,558
Holdin' my hand just as natural
as can be singin'

352
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:45,652
My name's Howard J. Turkstra.
I'm from Kansas City.

353
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:49,490
My hobbies are fast cars
and fast women.

354
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:55,289
'Cause that's why guys in my car club
call me "The Cruiser."

355
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:58,159
Should call him "The Dork."

356
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,170
Knock it off.

357
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,671
Go ahead.

358
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:06,807
I joined the army 'cause my father
and my brother were in the army.

359
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:11,304
I thought I better join
before I got drafted.

360
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:19,480
Son, there ain't no draft
no more.

361
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,059
There was one?

362
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:26,221
What a jerk!

363
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:28,890
Next.

364
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:32,969
The name's Francis Soyer.

365
00:29:34,672 --> 00:29:36,731
But everybody calls me "Psycho."

366
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:41,810
Any of you guys call me Francis,
and I'll kill you.

367
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:46,379
You just made the list, buddy.

368
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,318
And I don't like nobody
touchin' my stuff!

369
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:52,481
So just keep your meat hooks off.

370
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:55,390
If I catch any of you guys
in my stuft, I'll kill you.

371
00:29:57,128 --> 00:30:00,291
Also, I don't like
nobody touchin' me.

372
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:04,291
Now, any of you homos...

373
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:07,532
touch me, and I'll kill you.

374
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:12,471
Lighten up, Francis.

375
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:19,142
You're all in this together.

376
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:24,186
One of these men may save
your life one day, understand?

377
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:27,088
Then again, maybe one of us won't.

378
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:35,922
- You, go ahead.
- Me?

379
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,160
Yeah.

380
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:39,362
My name's Dewey Oxberger.

381
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:41,371
My friends call me "Ox."

382
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:44,533
You might have noticed
I've got a slight weight problem.

383
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:46,804
- No!
- Yeah, I do.

384
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:49,506
Anyway, I went to this doctor.

385
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:53,017
He told me I swallowed
a lot of aggression...

386
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:56,019
along with a lot of pizzas.

387
00:30:57,288 --> 00:30:59,449
I'm basically a shy person.

388
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,549
I'm a shy guy and...

389
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:05,323
he suggested taking one of these
aggression training courses.

390
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:09,230
You know, these aggression training
courses like EST, those type of things.

391
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,861
Anyway, it costs 400 bucks
to join this thing.

392
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:15,497
Well, I didn't have the money.

393
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:19,134
And I thought to myself,
"Join the army.

394
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,905
It's free."

395
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:24,346
So, I figured while I'm here
I'll lose a few pounds.

396
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:27,407
And you got, what, a six-to-eight week
training program here, a real tough one?

397
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:29,578
Which is perfect for me.

398
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:33,852
I'm gonna walk out of here
a lean, mean, fightin' machine.

399
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,994
- Good thinkin', Ox. Real good.
- It is.

400
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,791
Ziskey.

401
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:42,230
I've always been kind
of a pacifist.

402
00:31:43,801 --> 00:31:46,964
When I was a kid my father told me,
"Never hit anyone in anger...

403
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:50,064
unless you're absolutely sure
you can get away with it."

404
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,711
I don't know what kind
of soldier I'm gonna make...

405
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:59,409
but I want you guys to know that
if we ever get into real heavy combat...

406
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:04,453
I'll be right behind you guys
every step of the way.

407
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:12,528
Okay, Mr. Push-Ups.
Let's hear your story.

408
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:17,000
Chicks dig me because
I rarely wear underwear...

409
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:20,299
and when I do it's usually
something unusual.

410
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:25,775
But now I know why I have always
lost women to guys like you.

411
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:28,209
It's not just the uniform.

412
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,873
It's the stories that you tell.

413
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,440
So much fun and imagination.

414
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:35,918
Lee Harvey...

415
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:38,455
you are a madman.

416
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:43,849
When you stole that cow...

417
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:47,489
and your friends tried
to make it with the cow.

418
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:49,533
I want to party with you, cowboy.

419
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:54,266
The two of us together,
forget it.

420
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:57,804
I'm gonna go out on a limb here.

421
00:32:59,677 --> 00:33:02,578
I'm gonna volunteer my leadership
to this platoon.

422
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:05,411
An army without leaders
is like a foot...

423
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:08,718
without a big toe.

424
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:13,849
And Sergeant Hulka isn't always gonna
be there to be that big toe for us.

425
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:19,326
I think that we owe
a big round of applause...

426
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:22,298
to our newest, bestest buddy...

427
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:24,665
and big toe...

428
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,000
Sergeant Hulka.

429
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,414
Well, okay, hotshot.

430
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:41,782
We'll see what kind
of soldier you are.

431
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,946
Reveille is 0500.

432
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:47,420
We're gonna fall out
with locker boxes...

433
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:49,653
and we're gonna have
a locker box inspection.

434
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:53,686
And then we're gonna do ten miles,
rain or shine.

435
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:58,397
So you better hit them bunks,
my little babies...

436
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:03,338
or Hulka with the big toe's gonna see
how far he can stick it up your ass.

437
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:17,220
Out of them bunks!

438
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:28,256
We got a full day ahead of us.

439
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:30,994
We're gonna start out
with a five-mile run.

440
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:34,004
I know I'm speaking for
the entire platoon when I say...

441
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:38,805
this run should be postponed
until this platoon is better rested.

442
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:46,807
Well, I'll tell you what, soldier.
Let's make it ten miles.

443
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:48,613
Any more complaints?

444
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:53,423
Thanks a lot, Winger!

445
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:59,592
Nice going, asshole.

446
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:06,295
You're making friends fast
around here.

447
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:11,339
Oh, my-- Oh, my God! Mama!

448
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:22,617
Captain Stillman.

449
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:28,790
Major Ellis would like you to look over
these interim reports, Captain, sir.

450
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:34,628
Interim reports!
That's all I ever do around here.

451
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:36,633
I want some action!

452
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:40,026
Hold that, corporal.

453
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:45,471
Oh, look at those men.

454
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:47,272
Are those my men, corporal?

455
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:49,573
No, sir. Those are
Captain Benton's men, sir.

456
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:52,882
Well, where are my men?

457
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:55,475
Let's see. Sergeant Hulka
is on the confidence course.

458
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:57,578
Sergeant Crocker
is on the mortar range.

459
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:00,624
Terrific. Corporal,
bring up the Jeep.

460
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:02,317
Yes, sir.

461
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:06,696
Grenade!

462
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,631
Go get 'em!

463
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:25,079
Those are damn fine men.
Are they in my company?

464
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:28,243
No, sir. Oh, here come
your men now, sir.

465
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:10,894
Hit it!

466
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:15,254
Hit it!

467
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,345
Stand up when
I'm stickin' you, boy!

468
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,404
Get down and gimme 50, mother!

469
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:35,248
Come on! I'll walk on your ass, boy!
I was killing--

470
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:39,346
Fitteen, sixteen, seventeen--

471
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,414
Twenty seven, twenty eight--

472
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:16,454
Fall out!

473
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:21,024
- Fall in!
- Hey, Sergeant, it's raining.

474
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:23,828
Sergeant, I think it's a bad idea
to march today.

475
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:26,165
You know, this is
the cold and flu season.

476
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:29,872
Fifty one, Fifty two--

477
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:33,739
- When's the good part, John?
- This is the good part.

478
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:37,770
Get your butt down, soldier.
You'll get it shot off someday. Move it!

479
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:45,053
Pick a service
Pick a challenge

480
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:47,886
Set yourself apart

481
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:52,725
Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines

482
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:55,027
What a great day

483
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:58,557
It's a great way to start

484
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:08,044
Oh, God, look at that.

485
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:11,012
Wash off the soap. That's right.
Wash it off.

486
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:13,209
Look at that. Bend over.
Drop the soap.

487
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:16,651
Look at her tits. Oh, good.
Oh, God, I wish I was a loofah.

488
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:19,155
Look at that! That's--

489
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:21,657
Those muscles.

490
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:26,426
Oh, I didn't know
they could do that.

491
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:28,988
Excuse me, Captain.

492
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:30,966
I don't want to be disturbed.

493
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:36,105
- Yes, sir?
- Colonel Glass to see you, sir.

494
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:38,641
I can see that, corporal.
Dismissed.

495
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:41,507
Oh, it's a pleasure to see you, sir.
Welcome to Fort Arnold.

496
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:44,480
- Let's skip the bullshit, Captain.
- Yes, sir.

497
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:46,709
I've got a problem,
and I need your help.

498
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:49,582
You've heard of the EM-50 project?

499
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:52,053
Yes, sir. It's a tank or something.

500
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:54,591
- It's an urban-assault vehicle.
- Of course.

501
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:58,458
The Pentagon wants to unveil it
for the news media next month in Italy.

502
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:01,123
What General Barnicke
wants from you...

503
00:40:01,198 --> 00:40:05,760
is a real crack platoon of new recruits
to man the EM-50.

504
00:40:05,836 --> 00:40:07,861
Real go-getters.

505
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:11,635
We'll have them photographed
puttin' the 50 through its paces.

506
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:14,678
Our newest soldiers with our
latest weapon-- that kind of thing.

507
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:17,646
Yes, sir.
You can count on me, sir.

508
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:19,706
You screw this up...

509
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:22,981
and I'll have you assigned to a
weather station above the Arctic Circle.

510
00:40:23,053 --> 00:40:25,578
- You got that?
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

511
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:27,089
Good.

512
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:30,952
Attention!

513
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,733
- I'm gonna fold.
- Uh-huh. Okay.

514
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:41,999
Well, I'm still in.
Cruise, how about you?

515
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:44,539
Maybe I should fold.

516
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,769
Well, let me see.
Let me see first.

517
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:49,642
No, not with a hand like that.
Come on.

518
00:40:49,713 --> 00:40:52,375
Dare me. Go on, bluff me.
Come on.

519
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,384
How much should I bet?

520
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,716
If it were me,
I'd bet everything.

521
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:59,847
But that's me.
I'm an aggressive gambler. Mr. Vegas.

522
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:04,751
Come on. Go for it.

523
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:08,528
Yes, yes, there we go.
I'm in.

524
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:10,760
- What do you got?
- I got a full house.

525
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:14,168
Three threes and two sixes,
that's a full house. What have you got?

526
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:17,264
- I got a four, I got an ace.
- You got an eight, an ace and a seven.

527
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:21,835
Well, you lose. lf you would have had
four fours, you would have won.

528
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:23,846
- You're getting good.
- Starting to get the hang of it.

529
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:27,145
Isn't this fun? You're pretty good
for a first time, really.

530
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:29,481
Attention!

531
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:33,216
Fall in for muster.
Move it!

532
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,425
Ten-hut!

533
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:42,090
It's come to my attention...

534
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:45,795
that several members of
the Third Platoon Bravo Company...

535
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:48,634
left this military post
without permission.

536
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:53,904
I wanna know who it was.

537
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,673
You can tell me now...

538
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:03,913
or I got ways
of finding out myself.

539
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:18,159
Okay, mister...

540
00:42:18,235 --> 00:42:22,262
you just got yourself 24 hours
of scrubbin' garbage cans.

541
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:25,066
Step back!

542
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:31,939
Now, since nobody else
has got the guts...

543
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:36,114
to admit it...

544
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:39,720
the rest of this platoon...

545
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:42,452
will do the next two weekends on KP.

546
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,793
How's that sound to you, mister?

547
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:49,423
I think it sucks.

548
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:56,567
It's time you and me
had a private talk.

549
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,608
Step into my office.

550
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:14,550
I'm gettin' the idea
that you don't like me.

551
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:17,924
Maybe I just don't know you
well enough, sarge.

552
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:21,021
What do you say let's cut out
the bullshit between you and me.

553
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:24,124
- Oh, let's.
- I think you're a punk.

554
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:27,034
I've been in this army 28 years.

555
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:29,834
I've seen your kind
come and go.

556
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:36,277
You think you know something
about everything, don't you?

557
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:38,281
Let me tell you something, mister.

558
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:40,943
You don't know a damn thing
about soldiering.

559
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:45,148
It's real tough stuff. Especially that
marching-in-a-straight-line business.

560
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:48,817
I ain't talkin' about that crap!
I'm talkin' about somethin' important...

561
00:43:48,892 --> 00:43:52,419
like discipline, duty and honor and
courage, and you ain't got none of it.

562
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:56,557
Those words mean so much to a man
who scrubs garbage cans.

563
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:02,334
Look, if you don't want me in your army,
kick me out, but get off my back.

564
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:09,139
Maybe you'd like to, uh,
take a swing at me.

565
00:44:09,213 --> 00:44:12,808
I'd like to take
a big swing at you, sarge.

566
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:17,284
Well, go ahead and
give it your best shot.

567
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:19,845
I don't think I wanna go
to the stockade.

568
00:44:28,232 --> 00:44:30,962
I'll take my hat off.

569
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:37,907
There we are.

570
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:40,136
Ain't no more drill sergeant.

571
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:42,735
It's just you and me, kid,
man-to-man.

572
00:44:44,148 --> 00:44:46,139
So go ahead and give it
your best shot.

573
00:44:47,217 --> 00:44:48,707
Swing at me.

574
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:51,954
Gutless.

575
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:54,047
Punk.

576
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:10,639
I'm willing to forget about
this little incident.

577
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:13,973
And I want you to think
reaI hard about it.

578
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:17,775
And maybe someday you'll understand
what the hell I'm talkin' about.

579
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:31,786
No, don't stop.

580
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,999
I'll still respect you.

581
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:39,001
I'll respect you even more.

582
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:42,300
Just use more whipped cream.

583
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:54,149
I just had the weirdest dream.

584
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:14,500
If I call Anita, she has to
pick me up at the train, right?

585
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:22,545
I go back into an apartment.

586
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:25,013
I see if I can get
my cab job back.

587
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:43,355
Where are you going?
You going AWOL?

588
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:45,492
- No, I'm deserting.
- You idiot!

589
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:48,299
You desert now,
it's a federal offense.

590
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:50,840
- Come on.
- I'll take my chances with the feds.

591
00:46:50,908 --> 00:46:53,274
Get up. Come on.
You're not going anywhere.

592
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:56,403
Now listen to me.
You're gonna finish basic training...

593
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,779
keep your mouth shut
and do everything he tells you.

594
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:01,408
- You know why?
- Why?

595
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:06,081
Because you talked me into this,
that's why, you idiot! It was your idea!

596
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:08,750
I didn't talk you into this.
You needed this.

597
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:11,192
I'm gonna kill you! Damn you!

598
00:47:11,261 --> 00:47:13,991
Where's the great pay?
Where's the travel?

599
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:18,726
Where's the Winnebago?
Goddamn it! Shit!

600
00:47:29,046 --> 00:47:31,412
This isn't what you think.

601
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:33,449
No, we're just good friends.

602
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:35,717
In the Jeep.

603
00:47:38,255 --> 00:47:39,882
Come on. Let's go.

604
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:43,586
I was going to the laundry,
get my uniform.

605
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:46,322
Save it for later.

606
00:47:58,609 --> 00:48:01,100
Okay, guys, you're home.
Get out.

607
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:09,947
You're not gonna report this
or anything, are you?

608
00:48:11,288 --> 00:48:13,950
I'm gonna treat it
like a UFO sighting.

609
00:48:14,024 --> 00:48:17,858
I saw something,
but I'm not quite sure what it was.

610
00:48:17,928 --> 00:48:19,486
Thank you.

611
00:48:28,805 --> 00:48:30,670
Oh, good-bye.

612
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:03,462
Move it! Do it!

613
00:49:11,214 --> 00:49:12,806
Go on, boy.

614
00:49:13,984 --> 00:49:18,887
We got women can climb that thing better
than you. Get up! Get on your feet!

615
00:49:20,824 --> 00:49:22,348
Hit it!

616
00:49:22,426 --> 00:49:25,361
He said he couldn't make it.
Why don't you do it?

617
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:34,730
Take one step back.

618
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:36,929
Move it!

619
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:58,753
All right, soldier, let's see
how you fire that mortar.

620
00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:02,527
- What coordinates, sir?
- Coordinates?

621
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,859
Yes, sir. They determine
where the mortar's--

622
00:50:05,936 --> 00:50:09,895
Soldier, the army has spent a lot of
money teaching you how to fire that.

623
00:50:09,973 --> 00:50:12,441
Now set it and fire it.

624
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:16,275
- We don't know where the shell's gonna--
- The only way to learn is to do it!

625
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:19,242
Now fire the weapon.

626
00:50:26,823 --> 00:50:28,814
All right!

627
00:50:28,892 --> 00:50:32,453
Any of you suckholes want to
come up here and knock me off?

628
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:37,832
Oh, shit.

629
00:50:39,669 --> 00:50:41,762
Incoming!

630
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:09,721
Sergeant, does this mean
we're through for the day?

631
00:51:13,136 --> 00:51:14,763
Save your strength, Sarge.

632
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:17,102
Get him off! Get him off!

633
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:17,207
No stragglers. Now come on.

634
00:51:17,207 --> 00:51:19,038
No stragglers. Now come on.

635
00:51:19,109 --> 00:51:23,068
We owe it to Sergeant Hulka to end up
face down in the gutter tonight.

636
00:51:23,146 --> 00:51:24,841
Hey, baby, want to come
to my place?

637
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:27,907
Where were you two blocks ago
when we could've used you?

638
00:51:27,984 --> 00:51:29,918
Come on. Don't waste it.

639
00:51:29,986 --> 00:51:32,113
All right, we're here!
Come on.

640
00:51:33,156 --> 00:51:35,852
It's the Pom Pom.
lt's world famous.

641
00:51:46,703 --> 00:51:48,637
This might be fun.

642
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:51,172
Hi.

643
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:21,231
Oh, amazing.

644
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:24,171
I used to wrestle.
There's no tables.

645
00:52:24,241 --> 00:52:27,404
- Here's a table. Excuse me.
- Sounds good.

646
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:30,378
You wrestled, huh? Nice seats.

647
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:32,745
Give me a kick, honey.

648
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:34,408
Oh, parted my hair.

649
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:40,249
Okay, girls, go get 'em!

650
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:14,723
We're gonna start the bidding.

651
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:18,056
I'm not gonna accept
anything less than $100.

652
00:53:18,128 --> 00:53:20,255
The bidding has gotta start.
Now give me 100.

653
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:22,696
- You gotta do it for us, Ox.
- I can't.

654
00:53:22,766 --> 00:53:25,530
- You said you used to wrestle.
- I used to lose a lot.

655
00:53:25,602 --> 00:53:27,797
But these are girls.
They're weak and soft.

656
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:29,862
150!

657
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,305
160!

658
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:33,535
175 now! 175 here!

659
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:35,407
180!

660
00:53:35,478 --> 00:53:37,946
- It doesn't seem fair.
- Fair?

661
00:53:38,014 --> 00:53:41,211
Who cares about fair?
The world isn't fair! Truth isn't fair!

662
00:53:41,284 --> 00:53:44,253
Is it fair that you were
born like this? No!

663
00:53:44,321 --> 00:53:48,018
They're not expecting someone in there
like you. They're expecting some clown.

664
00:53:48,091 --> 00:53:51,492
You're different. You're weird.
You're a mutant. You're a killer!

665
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:53,392
You're a trained killer!

666
00:53:53,463 --> 00:53:56,728
You're a lean, mean,
fightin' machine!

667
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,700
I'll do it!

668
00:53:58,768 --> 00:54:02,260
- All right. Give me your money.
- 413 bucks!

669
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:06,901
My man. My big man here
is gonna do it all for us...

670
00:54:06,977 --> 00:54:09,707
for 413 dollars...

671
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:12,145
- And 58 cents.
- and 58 cents!

672
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,254
I'll take that!

673
00:54:24,394 --> 00:54:27,261
Ladies and gentlemen,
the big event you've been waiting for.

674
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:31,198
A three-round match,
five minute time limit, one pin only.

675
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:34,465
And during this match
there will be absolutely no biting.

676
00:54:34,537 --> 00:54:35,970
Ow!

677
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,668
And no pulling on the nose.

678
00:54:39,743 --> 00:54:43,406
Hey, do something about this, ref!
What kind of place you runnin' here?

679
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:47,141
And no kicking,
ladies and gentlemen.

680
00:54:47,217 --> 00:54:50,880
Oh, my God! To your neutral corners
and we will begin the match!

681
00:55:05,402 --> 00:55:07,632
Hey, wait a minute! Hey!

682
00:55:09,506 --> 00:55:11,337
Hey, just a second here!

683
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:23,616
Oh! Oh, geez! Now you done it.

684
00:55:28,925 --> 00:55:30,756
Beat the shit out of 'em, Ox!

685
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:35,161
- You hit me! I'm a girl!
- I'm sorry! I didn't mean to hit you!

686
00:55:38,768 --> 00:55:41,168
That's my man out there!
My champ! Now stop it!

687
00:55:47,977 --> 00:55:51,071
Behind you!
She's not even in the fight.

688
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,965
Cut that out.

689
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:14,094
You get in here. Come on.

690
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:16,104
I'm a gentleman. Now stop it.

691
00:56:18,764 --> 00:56:20,884
Drink.

692
00:56:20,924 --> 00:56:22,524
- Thanks.
- No problem.

693
00:56:22,604 --> 00:56:24,684
- Thanks again.
- Okay, all right.

694
00:56:24,764 --> 00:56:27,244
- You're very competitive.
- I don't wanna go back.

695
00:56:27,324 --> 00:56:30,324
You gotta go back.
You're already dirty. Come on.

696
00:56:31,604 --> 00:56:33,204
There you go.

697
00:56:53,804 --> 00:56:55,724
They got him down and pinned!

698
00:57:03,404 --> 00:57:05,924
Bravo Company!

699
00:57:09,284 --> 00:57:11,564
Bravo Company!

700
00:57:11,644 --> 00:57:13,244
Go, man!

701
00:57:19,924 --> 00:57:22,684
Way to go, Ox! Kill 'em!

702
00:57:51,444 --> 00:57:53,964
- Should we?
- Yeah. Let's go.

703
00:58:00,204 --> 00:58:02,124
We'll take care of these two.

704
00:58:02,204 --> 00:58:04,924
It's okay. Special assignment.

705
00:58:04,964 --> 00:58:06,524
Yeah, we're with them.

706
00:58:06,604 --> 00:58:10,404
Louise, it's so nice to see you.
What are you doin' here?

707
00:58:13,044 --> 00:58:15,844
Well, explain yourselves.

708
00:58:19,644 --> 00:58:22,764
Well, sir, we were--

709
00:58:22,844 --> 00:58:24,924
we were going
to the bingo parlor...

710
00:58:25,004 --> 00:58:27,044
at the YMCA.

711
00:58:27,124 --> 00:58:29,844
Well, one thing led to another...

712
00:58:29,924 --> 00:58:32,444
and the instructions
got all fouled up there.

713
00:58:32,524 --> 00:58:34,964
- We ended up--
- Shut up.

714
00:58:35,044 --> 00:58:36,524
Okay, sir.

715
00:58:39,524 --> 00:58:42,204
You men are a disgrace.

716
00:58:45,004 --> 00:58:49,124
Maybe a few days
in the stockade...

717
00:58:49,204 --> 00:58:53,724
would help change
your rotten attitude.

718
00:58:53,804 --> 00:58:56,804
But we're supposed to
graduate tomorrow, sir.

719
00:58:58,204 --> 00:58:59,804
That's even better.

720
00:59:02,164 --> 00:59:06,284
Tomorrow you'll be on parade
in front of General Barnicke.

721
00:59:08,004 --> 00:59:11,684
And when he sees
what total fuck-ups you really are...

722
00:59:12,564 --> 00:59:14,644
I will personally recommend...

723
00:59:14,724 --> 00:59:17,164
that your whole platoon...

724
00:59:17,244 --> 00:59:20,484
repeat the entire course
of basic training.

725
00:59:35,164 --> 00:59:36,764
Well, get out.

726
00:59:47,404 --> 00:59:50,444
All right, now this is the second time
we've let you guys off.

727
00:59:50,524 --> 00:59:53,404
Let's not let it happen a third time.
ls that clear?

728
00:59:53,484 --> 00:59:56,964
- Very clear.
- Get back to your barracks, all right?

729
00:59:57,044 --> 00:59:59,284
- Good night.
- Good night.

730
00:59:59,364 --> 01:00:01,324
So, what are you guys gonna do?

731
01:00:02,644 --> 01:00:04,564
We're just gonna check out
General Barnicke's house.

732
01:00:04,644 --> 01:00:06,604
He's still in Washington.

733
01:00:09,964 --> 01:00:13,044
He still owes me money.
Hey, Barney!

734
01:00:14,204 --> 01:00:16,484
Gentlemen!

735
01:00:16,524 --> 01:00:18,924
Mom! I'm home!

736
01:00:22,284 --> 01:00:25,804
Now, don't worry
about a thing, okay?

737
01:00:25,884 --> 01:00:28,284
Oh, this is nice, really.

738
01:00:29,844 --> 01:00:33,204
Listen, if this is gonna get you
in trouble, we'll leave. All right?

739
01:00:33,244 --> 01:00:36,724
No, it's okay. GeneraI Barnicke's
gonna be gone until tomorrow morning.

740
01:00:36,804 --> 01:00:38,244
Good.

741
01:00:40,524 --> 01:00:41,964
Thank you.

742
01:00:43,284 --> 01:00:46,404
I feel like I'm 16 years old
in my parents' house...

743
01:00:46,484 --> 01:00:48,764
and they're away on a trip.

744
01:00:48,844 --> 01:00:51,804
Sixteen?
Wanna play spin the bottle?

745
01:00:51,884 --> 01:00:54,364
This guy's doing pretty well.
Interested?

746
01:00:54,444 --> 01:00:57,244
All right, you've looked at
the General's refrigerator long enough.

747
01:00:57,324 --> 01:01:00,404
- Let's go. Come on.
- Let's look at the General's cupboards.

748
01:01:03,084 --> 01:01:05,924
You know, you're very pretty...

749
01:01:07,244 --> 01:01:08,644
for a cop.

750
01:01:08,724 --> 01:01:11,644
- Oh, thanks a lot.
- No. Thank you.

751
01:01:11,684 --> 01:01:13,724
- You know what your problem is, baby?
- No, I don't.

752
01:01:13,804 --> 01:01:16,444
Your problem is that you're
heavily armed, you know.

753
01:01:16,484 --> 01:01:18,964
Guys have trouble with girls
that are armed.

754
01:01:19,044 --> 01:01:20,964
They don't know how to come on.

755
01:01:21,044 --> 01:01:23,484
- Do you know the rest of your problem?
- Tell me.

756
01:01:23,524 --> 01:01:26,084
You've never had anybody give you
the Aunt Jemima treatment.

757
01:01:26,164 --> 01:01:30,004
- No, I certainly haven't had that.
- First you get up on the grill.

758
01:01:31,444 --> 01:01:33,964
- I'll get you up to cruising speed.
- Stop!

759
01:01:34,044 --> 01:01:38,364
You're sticking on the bottom, dear.
Keep hopping.

760
01:01:38,444 --> 01:01:41,324
There you go.
A little bit lumpy.

761
01:01:43,644 --> 01:01:47,204
- I'm not enjoying this! Quit it!
- You're not, huh?

762
01:01:47,284 --> 01:01:49,164
Maybe you need this.

763
01:01:50,284 --> 01:01:53,684
- What are you gonna do with that?
- This. And this.

764
01:01:56,724 --> 01:01:59,604
Who's your friend?
Who's your buddy?

765
01:01:59,684 --> 01:02:02,164
I am, aren't I?
You're crazy about me.

766
01:02:02,204 --> 01:02:04,964
You're incredibly
head-over-heels in love with me.

767
01:02:05,004 --> 01:02:07,484
You're helplessly, hopelessly,
deeply in love with me, aren't you?

768
01:02:07,564 --> 01:02:09,564
Yes.

769
01:02:10,484 --> 01:02:13,324
I knew it.
I had that feeling.

770
01:02:13,404 --> 01:02:15,844
Even before I picked this up.

771
01:02:17,204 --> 01:02:19,164
It's about time you came around.

772
01:02:19,964 --> 01:02:21,684
So what do we do now?

773
01:02:22,604 --> 01:02:25,684
Let's go upstairs
and check out the general's closets.

774
01:02:29,604 --> 01:02:31,924
It's nice to know you can
move like that when you have to.

775
01:02:31,964 --> 01:02:35,084
Well, it's nice to know
you can make me so hot.

776
01:02:35,164 --> 01:02:37,084
You say the nicest things.

777
01:02:37,164 --> 01:02:40,444
Hold on, honey.
I got a speciaI tooI for you.

778
01:02:40,524 --> 01:02:42,084
Come here.

779
01:02:44,924 --> 01:02:47,444
I can't believe
we're playing this.

780
01:02:47,524 --> 01:02:50,604
- Okay, down on your knees.
- Sounds good.

781
01:02:51,884 --> 01:02:54,684
All right now, the way
that you play it is...

782
01:02:54,764 --> 01:02:58,244
you pretend there's a force field
aII around your body...

783
01:02:58,324 --> 01:03:02,524
and you try and get as close
to each other as possible...

784
01:03:02,604 --> 01:03:05,244
without actually touching.

785
01:03:05,324 --> 01:03:07,924
- Okay?
- It sounds easy.

786
01:03:09,884 --> 01:03:11,804
It oughta be.

787
01:03:19,084 --> 01:03:21,284
I think I'm good at this.

788
01:03:21,364 --> 01:03:23,444
Maybe.

789
01:03:23,524 --> 01:03:25,444
How do you win?

790
01:03:25,524 --> 01:03:28,764
Well, if somebody breaks
your force field, then you win.

791
01:03:30,684 --> 01:03:33,644
- You just broke my torce field.
- Yeah, you win.

792
01:03:46,204 --> 01:03:48,724
Well, that was interesting.

793
01:03:50,364 --> 01:03:54,644
It's all over with now. We might as well
not even show up to graduation.

794
01:03:54,724 --> 01:03:57,244
You white guys'll probably
get five years.

795
01:03:57,324 --> 01:03:59,244
- But we gonna get hung.
- Yeah, man.

796
01:03:59,324 --> 01:04:01,644
Guys! Hey!

797
01:04:06,204 --> 01:04:10,724
What's everybody so down about? Didn't
everybody make it with a beautifuI MP?

798
01:04:10,804 --> 01:04:14,764
Oh, Stillman freaked out
when the MPs brought us back.

799
01:04:14,844 --> 01:04:18,004
If we screw up graduation, we'll
have to take basics all over again.

800
01:04:18,084 --> 01:04:21,004
Ah, Cruise, it's been a lot of fun
the first time, hasn't it?

801
01:04:21,044 --> 01:04:23,764
I can't handle
basic training again, man.

802
01:04:27,244 --> 01:04:29,484
You're number one
on the death list now, Winger.

803
01:04:32,524 --> 01:04:35,244
Take it easy, Francis-- Psycho.

804
01:04:37,884 --> 01:04:41,124
Will you guys just relax.
We got plenty of time? What time is it?

805
01:04:41,204 --> 01:04:43,684
- 2:00 a.m.
- Okay, 0200.

806
01:04:43,724 --> 01:04:46,124
- What time do we get up?
- 5:00 a.m.

807
01:04:46,164 --> 01:04:51,364
0500. All right, we have three hours.
Didn't you ever cram for a test before?

808
01:04:53,404 --> 01:04:55,964
I learned two semesters
of geology in three hours.

809
01:04:56,044 --> 01:04:58,284
We can do this.
We just have to practice.

810
01:04:58,364 --> 01:05:01,364
We've been practicing all night,
and we stink.

811
01:05:01,444 --> 01:05:05,444
- Yeah, well, the brains have arrived.
- Yeah, that's good news.

812
01:05:05,524 --> 01:05:07,484
We go down to the motor pool.

813
01:05:07,524 --> 01:05:09,804
We work on it all night.
We get it together.

814
01:05:09,884 --> 01:05:13,564
- We can do this, right?
- There's no way in hell we can do it.

815
01:05:13,644 --> 01:05:15,884
Right shoulder, arms!

816
01:05:18,124 --> 01:05:20,684
Forward, arms!

817
01:05:20,764 --> 01:05:22,964
Inspection, arms!

818
01:05:25,084 --> 01:05:27,124
Right shoulder, arms!

819
01:05:28,484 --> 01:05:30,764
Right face!

820
01:05:31,404 --> 01:05:33,204
Your left...

821
01:05:35,524 --> 01:05:37,844
Come on, rhythm.
Hut, two, three, four.

822
01:05:37,924 --> 01:05:39,964
Black guys heIp the white guys, okay?

823
01:05:40,044 --> 01:05:43,924
- What did he say?
- He said the black guys...

824
01:05:44,004 --> 01:05:45,604
help the white guys.

825
01:05:47,404 --> 01:05:49,364
Come on, guys!

826
01:05:49,444 --> 01:05:51,364
Wait a minute!

827
01:05:54,524 --> 01:05:56,004
Cut it out! Stop!

828
01:05:57,084 --> 01:05:59,204
Hey, stupid,
look at yourself!

829
01:05:59,284 --> 01:06:01,204
Cut it out!

830
01:06:04,724 --> 01:06:07,284
What the hell's
the matter with you?

831
01:06:07,364 --> 01:06:08,964
Stupid!

832
01:06:11,044 --> 01:06:13,124
We're all very different people.

833
01:06:13,204 --> 01:06:16,204
We're not Watusi.
We're not Spartans.

834
01:06:16,284 --> 01:06:19,644
We're Americans
with a capital "A," huh?

835
01:06:19,724 --> 01:06:21,684
You know what that means?

836
01:06:21,764 --> 01:06:25,044
Do you? That means
that our forefathers...

837
01:06:25,124 --> 01:06:28,884
were kicked out of every
decent country in the worId.

838
01:06:28,964 --> 01:06:32,564
We are the wretched refuse.

839
01:06:34,604 --> 01:06:37,764
We're the underdog.
We're mutts.

840
01:06:37,844 --> 01:06:41,084
Here's proof.
His nose is cold.

841
01:06:41,964 --> 01:06:45,044
But there's no animal
that's more faithfuI...

842
01:06:45,124 --> 01:06:49,644
that's more loyal,
more loveable than the mutt.

843
01:06:49,724 --> 01:06:51,164
Who saw Old Yeller?

844
01:06:54,924 --> 01:06:58,124
Who cried when Old Yeller
got shot at the end?

845
01:06:58,204 --> 01:07:01,164
Nobody cried
when Old Yeller got shot?

846
01:07:01,204 --> 01:07:02,884
I'm sure.

847
01:07:04,764 --> 01:07:07,204
I cried my eyes out.

848
01:07:07,244 --> 01:07:08,684
Yeah.

849
01:07:08,764 --> 01:07:12,324
So we're all dogfaces.
We're all very different.

850
01:07:12,404 --> 01:07:15,324
But there is one thing
that we all have in common.

851
01:07:15,404 --> 01:07:20,324
We were all stupid enough
to enlist in the army.

852
01:07:20,404 --> 01:07:21,924
We're mutants.

853
01:07:22,004 --> 01:07:26,764
There's something wrong with us,
something very wrong with us.

854
01:07:26,844 --> 01:07:29,204
Something seriously wrong with us.

855
01:07:29,284 --> 01:07:33,204
We're soldiers,
but we're American soIdiers.

856
01:07:33,284 --> 01:07:37,884
We've been kickin' ass for 200 years!
We're ten and one!

857
01:07:39,604 --> 01:07:42,964
And we don't have to worry...

858
01:07:43,004 --> 01:07:45,884
about whether or not
we've practiced.

859
01:07:45,964 --> 01:07:48,044
We don't have to worry...

860
01:07:48,124 --> 01:07:50,924
about whether Captain Stillman
wants to have us hung.

861
01:07:51,004 --> 01:07:53,644
All we have to do...

862
01:07:53,684 --> 01:07:57,524
is to be the great American
fighting soldier...

863
01:07:58,444 --> 01:08:01,124
that is inside each one of us.

864
01:08:02,604 --> 01:08:04,524
Now, do what I do...

865
01:08:06,564 --> 01:08:08,924
and say what I say...

866
01:08:12,484 --> 01:08:14,684
and make me proud.

867
01:08:16,204 --> 01:08:19,164
- Fall in!
- Yes!

868
01:08:20,404 --> 01:08:21,844
Platoon...

869
01:08:23,844 --> 01:08:25,764
attention!

870
01:08:28,084 --> 01:08:30,764
Right shoulder, ho!

871
01:08:32,324 --> 01:08:34,244
Order, ho!

872
01:08:57,324 --> 01:08:59,164
Maybe they couldn't find
the parade grounds.

873
01:08:59,244 --> 01:09:02,204
- It's right in front of the barracks.
- That's what I mean.

874
01:09:10,964 --> 01:09:13,244
Eyes right!

875
01:09:16,004 --> 01:09:18,324
We checked the barracks, sir.
They're not there.

876
01:09:18,364 --> 01:09:21,644
If they're not here in five minutes,
I want them arrested.

877
01:09:34,644 --> 01:09:38,204
Hey, graduation's at 2:00.
What time is it now?

878
01:09:40,004 --> 01:09:42,164
3:00. We've still got
an hour to sleep.

879
01:09:42,244 --> 01:09:44,004
Oh, good.

880
01:09:44,084 --> 01:09:46,644
3:00! We're missing it!

881
01:09:50,324 --> 01:09:52,244
We're missing graduation.

882
01:09:52,324 --> 01:09:54,604
- We're missing it.
- Let's go.

883
01:09:54,684 --> 01:09:57,164
Guys, wake up, man!
We're missing it.

884
01:10:27,204 --> 01:10:29,164
Where is it?

885
01:11:18,484 --> 01:11:21,684
All right, let's do
a little singing this morning.

886
01:11:26,684 --> 01:11:28,684
Slept late

887
01:11:28,764 --> 01:11:31,044
Feels great

888
01:11:31,124 --> 01:11:33,284
Wine and women

889
01:11:33,364 --> 01:11:35,444
All gone

890
01:11:35,524 --> 01:11:37,844
Oh, my God!

891
01:11:37,924 --> 01:11:40,404
Spare time

892
01:11:40,444 --> 01:11:42,764
All gone

893
01:11:42,844 --> 01:11:45,164
Party guy

894
01:11:45,244 --> 01:11:47,444
Bye-bye

895
01:11:47,524 --> 01:11:49,764
All night

896
01:11:49,844 --> 01:11:52,044
Got tight

897
01:11:52,124 --> 01:11:54,244
Felt good

898
01:11:54,324 --> 01:11:56,404
Real nice

899
01:11:56,484 --> 01:11:58,444
Real good

900
01:11:58,524 --> 01:12:00,444
Oh-ho

901
01:12:03,484 --> 01:12:05,084
Platoon...

902
01:12:07,164 --> 01:12:09,204
a-one, two...

903
01:12:17,724 --> 01:12:19,684
Where the hell
have you been, soldier?

904
01:12:20,764 --> 01:12:22,324
Training, sir!

905
01:12:23,884 --> 01:12:25,924
What kind of training, son?

906
01:12:26,004 --> 01:12:28,884
Army training, sir!

907
01:12:32,564 --> 01:12:34,924
Just like last night,
only better!

908
01:12:34,964 --> 01:12:38,324
Men! Right shoulder, ho!

909
01:12:40,404 --> 01:12:42,364
Order, ho!

910
01:12:43,844 --> 01:12:45,604
Side step right!
Why did the chicken cross the road?

911
01:12:45,644 --> 01:12:47,564
Why did the chicken
cross the road

912
01:12:47,644 --> 01:12:49,604
To get from the left
to the right

913
01:12:49,684 --> 01:12:52,924
Het! Hut!

914
01:12:53,004 --> 01:12:55,004
He stepped out of rank
got hit by a tank

915
01:12:55,084 --> 01:12:57,044
He ain't no chicken no more

916
01:12:57,084 --> 01:12:59,044
Left flank, left!

917
01:13:04,244 --> 01:13:06,764
Queen Anne salute!

918
01:13:08,644 --> 01:13:11,044
Three, five, seven!

919
01:13:16,404 --> 01:13:18,524
Razzle-dazzle!

920
01:13:18,604 --> 01:13:21,004
Hut, two, three, four!

921
01:13:24,044 --> 01:13:28,484
The quick brown fox jumped
over the lazy dog, sir!

922
01:13:40,764 --> 01:13:42,764
Where's your drill sergeant, men?

923
01:13:42,804 --> 01:13:45,124
Blown up, sir!

924
01:13:49,084 --> 01:13:53,884
Sir, these are Sergeant Hulka's men.
He was injured during basic training.

925
01:13:53,964 --> 01:13:55,804
I see.

926
01:13:55,844 --> 01:13:59,364
So am I to understand that you men
completed your training on your own?

927
01:13:59,444 --> 01:14:01,364
That's the fact, Jack!

928
01:14:03,164 --> 01:14:05,124
- Captain.
- Yes, sir?

929
01:14:05,204 --> 01:14:07,204
These are exactly
the kind of go-getters...

930
01:14:07,284 --> 01:14:10,124
I want working on my EM-50
project in ltaly.

931
01:14:10,204 --> 01:14:12,004
Oh, but, sir, these men--

932
01:14:12,084 --> 01:14:15,644
Don't "but" me, Captain.
I want them on the plane tonight.

933
01:14:17,564 --> 01:14:21,164
Gentlemen, it's party time,
ltalian style!

934
01:14:42,604 --> 01:14:44,044
Not bad! Hey!

935
01:14:45,284 --> 01:14:46,724
Best bunk?

936
01:14:49,564 --> 01:14:51,524
That's mine right there.

937
01:14:53,604 --> 01:14:56,804
Okay, who's up for the Vatican?

938
01:14:56,884 --> 01:14:59,164
Let's get some people
and some relics, and we'll do it.

939
01:15:00,964 --> 01:15:05,044
What are you doing?
No, get off. You gotta make my bunk.

940
01:15:05,124 --> 01:15:08,604
We're in ltaly. The guy on the top bunk
has gotta make the guy on the bottom--

941
01:15:08,684 --> 01:15:11,604
He's gotta make his bed all the time.
It's in the regulations.

942
01:15:11,684 --> 01:15:14,404
If we were in Germany,
I would have to make yours.

943
01:15:14,484 --> 01:15:17,444
But we're in ltaly, so you've
gotta make mine. It's regulations.

944
01:15:18,284 --> 01:15:20,324
Who makes the beds?

945
01:15:20,404 --> 01:15:23,284
Buona sera, gentlemen.

946
01:15:25,244 --> 01:15:27,924
It is alive.

947
01:15:38,444 --> 01:15:40,404
Welcome to Italy.

948
01:15:41,884 --> 01:15:44,564
We can forget all about
the fearful reunion.

949
01:15:46,404 --> 01:15:50,804
There's a couple of things I want to get
straight with you right off the bat.

950
01:15:50,884 --> 01:15:54,804
I don't know what kind of shit
you pulled at graduation...

951
01:15:54,884 --> 01:15:57,684
but this ain't
no glamour detaiI we're on.

952
01:15:58,964 --> 01:16:00,924
I want to see you walkin' tall...

953
01:16:01,004 --> 01:16:04,164
lookin' good and mentally alert
at all times.

954
01:16:04,204 --> 01:16:05,884
I'm gonna bust your butts...

955
01:16:05,964 --> 01:16:09,604
to make this the best damned outfit
in the European command.

956
01:16:11,924 --> 01:16:16,324
Get these bunks made up!
Get your gear stored!

957
01:16:16,404 --> 01:16:20,004
We're gonna muster in front
ot the motor pooI at 0600! Got it?

958
01:16:20,724 --> 01:16:22,324
Hi, Sarge.

959
01:16:24,324 --> 01:16:27,324
"Hi, Sarge."
Just shut up.

960
01:16:27,404 --> 01:16:29,284
0600!

961
01:16:42,284 --> 01:16:44,364
As you may know,
GeneraI Barnicke...

962
01:16:44,444 --> 01:16:47,164
is particularly interested
in this project.

963
01:16:48,484 --> 01:16:52,404
He has selected this platoon
for this assignment...

964
01:16:53,964 --> 01:16:57,324
and he expects you to perform
particularly well.

965
01:16:58,724 --> 01:17:00,684
Raise it, Sergeant.

966
01:17:03,964 --> 01:17:08,604
Gentlemen, this is the EM-50
Urban Assault Vehicle.

967
01:17:15,404 --> 01:17:19,164
A reaI beauty, Colonel.
You can count on us.

968
01:17:26,524 --> 01:17:30,444
This is amazing. You wouldn't believe
what this thing could do.

969
01:17:40,804 --> 01:17:44,884
- Do you think I'm officer material?
- God, I'm worried about you.

970
01:17:44,964 --> 01:17:47,284
Come on. I'm in good shape.
I'm walkin' tall.

971
01:17:47,364 --> 01:17:50,284
I'm lookin' good.
First weekend in Europe.

972
01:17:50,364 --> 01:17:54,524
Yeah. We're spending it
in an airplane hangar watching a truck.

973
01:17:54,604 --> 01:17:56,324
We got each other.

974
01:17:56,404 --> 01:17:59,564
Well, I was kinda thinking we'd get
a couple of companions this weekend.

975
01:17:59,644 --> 01:18:01,884
Too bad the girls
are in Germany.

976
01:18:01,924 --> 01:18:05,444
- We could get a hoteI room somewhere.
- Yeah.

977
01:18:05,524 --> 01:18:09,164
- Spend a few days eating room service.
- WouId've been good.

978
01:18:09,244 --> 01:18:13,324
We could take 'em up in the Alps
for a little spin.

979
01:18:20,084 --> 01:18:21,684
Oh, yeah.

980
01:18:26,604 --> 01:18:28,524
- I'll drive.
- Okay.

981
01:18:35,564 --> 01:18:37,244
We're here.

982
01:18:37,324 --> 01:18:39,724
Don't forget, you promised me
a reaI expensive dinner...

983
01:18:39,764 --> 01:18:42,364
before we see this--
whatever it is.

984
01:18:42,444 --> 01:18:44,084
Right.

985
01:18:49,324 --> 01:18:51,244
Come with me, my dear.

986
01:18:58,684 --> 01:19:03,164
Now, don't forget, this is a secret,
so you can't tell anybody, okay?

987
01:19:03,244 --> 01:19:05,604
Not unless they torture me.

988
01:19:07,764 --> 01:19:11,084
- OfficiaI business.
- May I see your identification?

989
01:19:11,124 --> 01:19:13,204
Thank you, Captain.

990
01:19:13,284 --> 01:19:16,804
Uh, yeah.
Just follow me.

991
01:19:20,404 --> 01:19:24,364
When the Army entrusts an important
project like this to an officer...

992
01:19:24,404 --> 01:19:29,364
it usually means they're priming him
for a major promotion.

993
01:19:29,444 --> 01:19:30,884
Wow.

994
01:19:34,204 --> 01:19:36,564
I really think
you're gonna like this.

995
01:19:36,644 --> 01:19:38,604
Yeah?

996
01:19:46,404 --> 01:19:49,684
- Are you gonna get sick or something?
- Where the fuck's my truck?

997
01:19:54,284 --> 01:19:57,484
Hey, where's the EM-50?

998
01:19:57,564 --> 01:20:00,164
A couple of soldiers took it
to get it washed, sir.

999
01:20:00,244 --> 01:20:02,204
Took it to get it washed?

1000
01:20:02,244 --> 01:20:04,804
ls there a bathroom around here?
I gotta pee.

1001
01:20:04,844 --> 01:20:06,804
- Hold it!
- They had proper l.D., sir.

1002
01:20:06,884 --> 01:20:09,804
Did you want me to notify
Post Security, sir?

1003
01:20:09,884 --> 01:20:12,684
You keep your mouth shut about this.
Do you understand me?

1004
01:20:12,724 --> 01:20:16,244
And you Iet no one in there.
No one! Not even the colonel!

1005
01:20:16,324 --> 01:20:17,564
Yes, sir.

1006
01:20:22,724 --> 01:20:25,284
You know, I think this guy
Stillman is really dangerous.

1007
01:20:25,364 --> 01:20:27,564
Yeah, I'm becoming
aware of that, you know.

1008
01:20:29,724 --> 01:20:32,844
Okay, let's go.
Let's load that truck.

1009
01:20:32,924 --> 01:20:34,364
Sergeant.

1010
01:20:35,564 --> 01:20:39,564
We've traced the EM-50 to Germany.
They're probably heading to East Berlin.

1011
01:20:39,644 --> 01:20:42,564
Sir, if you'll take my advice,
there's a crack squad in the 42nd...

1012
01:20:42,644 --> 01:20:44,564
that couId link up
with the Air Recon.

1013
01:20:44,644 --> 01:20:47,244
We'd have that EM-50 back here
inside of 24 hours.

1014
01:20:47,324 --> 01:20:50,524
We'd be the laughingstock
of the whole armed forces.

1015
01:20:50,604 --> 01:20:52,564
We will do this ourseIves.

1016
01:20:52,644 --> 01:20:55,404
Sir, those numb-nuts can't
even tie their own shoelaces.

1017
01:20:55,484 --> 01:20:59,244
I don't care, Sergeant.
Just load the truck, and let's move out.

1018
01:21:00,404 --> 01:21:02,764
AII right, we're moving out!
Move!

1019
01:21:04,364 --> 01:21:06,284
I guess we're going after
John and Russell.

1020
01:21:06,364 --> 01:21:08,884
I can't believe
they're Russian spies. Can you?

1021
01:21:08,964 --> 01:21:12,284
All I know is,
I finally get to kill somebody.

1022
01:21:36,644 --> 01:21:39,164
Have you been doing
your speciaI exercises?

1023
01:21:39,204 --> 01:21:41,964
- I brought the magic suitcase.
- You did?

1024
01:21:48,084 --> 01:21:52,124
- I can't see a thing up ahead, sir.
- The turnoff is just up to the right.

1025
01:21:52,204 --> 01:21:54,844
No, sir.
If we turn right, we're going--

1026
01:21:54,924 --> 01:21:58,764
When I want your input,
I will ask for it. Thank you.

1027
01:22:48,804 --> 01:22:51,004
For Christ's sakes, Captain.
We just broke through the--

1028
01:22:51,044 --> 01:22:55,284
This is my mission. I would appreciate
if you let me run it. Thank you.

1029
01:22:57,844 --> 01:22:58,924
Fuck this.

1030
01:23:10,084 --> 01:23:12,804
- Hey, Sarge, where are you going?
- What's going on, Sarge?

1031
01:23:12,884 --> 01:23:15,404
Sarge, what are you doing?

1032
01:23:56,364 --> 01:24:00,524
Here you go. There you go.
Get 'em up there, boys.

1033
01:24:00,604 --> 01:24:02,204
Stupid jerks.

1034
01:24:55,844 --> 01:24:55,964
Dankeschon, darling

1035
01:24:55,964 --> 01:24:58,804
Dankeschon, darling

1036
01:25:00,044 --> 01:25:02,724
Gunther, get yourself
a new Volkswagen, huh?

1037
01:25:04,124 --> 01:25:07,604
Folks, don't order the schnitzel.
They're using schnauzer.

1038
01:25:09,324 --> 01:25:12,764
Hey, Hansel, Gretel!
We're your allies.

1039
01:25:12,844 --> 01:25:15,244
It's cool. All right.

1040
01:25:15,324 --> 01:25:18,204
All right, Klaus,
hold it up right here.

1041
01:25:18,284 --> 01:25:21,084
We got some naked animals in here
we don't want you to see.

1042
01:25:21,164 --> 01:25:23,084
Here you are.

1043
01:25:24,964 --> 01:25:26,804
- Here, more worthless money for you.
- Come on.

1044
01:25:26,884 --> 01:25:29,884
- All right.
- Did you leave the radio on?

1045
01:25:29,964 --> 01:25:31,884
- What do you mean?
- It's a shortwaver.

1046
01:25:31,964 --> 01:25:33,884
This is the EM-50?

1047
01:25:39,604 --> 01:25:41,044
Mayday.

1048
01:25:42,884 --> 01:25:44,804
Code 21, status 7.

1049
01:25:47,324 --> 01:25:49,084
Code 21. Go ahead.

1050
01:25:49,124 --> 01:25:53,524
I'm with the U.S. Army,
41st Armored Division, Bravo Company.

1051
01:25:53,604 --> 01:25:56,964
I have a platoon and C.O.
being held by hostile enemy...

1052
01:25:57,044 --> 01:26:01,804
at coordinates 416397.

1053
01:26:01,884 --> 01:26:04,884
They're Russian troops,
about 200.

1054
01:26:04,964 --> 01:26:08,204
Send help. I gotta get movin'.

1055
01:26:08,244 --> 01:26:12,764
Hmm, 416397.
That's Czechoslovakia.

1056
01:26:14,044 --> 01:26:17,324
- 41st Armored?
- Yeah, Bravo Company.

1057
01:26:19,204 --> 01:26:22,124
- That's our unit.
- Oh, no.

1058
01:26:22,204 --> 01:26:25,684
- They came looking for us.
- Oh, they've had it.

1059
01:26:25,764 --> 01:26:27,524
We've had it.

1060
01:26:27,604 --> 01:26:30,524
If it's a status 7 like you said,
they went in undercover.

1061
01:26:30,564 --> 01:26:33,524
So the D.O.D. won't even
acknowledge it.

1062
01:26:33,604 --> 01:26:35,524
Those guys are dead.

1063
01:26:37,044 --> 01:26:40,044
- We gotta go get 'em.
- Yeah.

1064
01:26:40,124 --> 01:26:42,804
We're responsible.

1065
01:26:42,844 --> 01:26:44,804
Come on, it's Czechoslovakia.

1066
01:26:44,844 --> 01:26:47,244
We zip in, we pick 'em up
and we zip right out again.

1067
01:26:47,324 --> 01:26:49,804
We're not going to Moscow.
It's Czechoslovakia.

1068
01:26:49,884 --> 01:26:51,644
It's like going into Wisconsin.

1069
01:26:51,684 --> 01:26:54,884
Well, I got the shit kicked out of me
in Wisconsin once. Forget it.

1070
01:27:18,204 --> 01:27:21,644
We're so damn lost.
Where the hell is Innsbruck, Austria?

1071
01:27:21,684 --> 01:27:23,644
We're gonna do some skiing.

1072
01:27:26,764 --> 01:27:29,284
- Do you know Brandy? Hi, girls.
- Excuse me.

1073
01:27:29,364 --> 01:27:32,724
What a darling unitorm.
Is there a bathroom here?

1074
01:27:35,004 --> 01:27:37,124
There must be a bathroom
around here somewhere.

1075
01:27:42,884 --> 01:27:47,564
Hi. I'm John Winger of the United States
Army and you are my prisoner.

1076
01:27:47,644 --> 01:27:49,164
Why are you doing this?

1077
01:27:50,684 --> 01:27:52,644
Oh, Chicago.

1078
01:27:54,124 --> 01:27:57,204
What do we want with prisoners?

1079
01:27:57,284 --> 01:27:59,204
Come on, move!

1080
01:28:04,524 --> 01:28:06,964
Do the words "act of war"
mean anything to you, huh?

1081
01:28:07,044 --> 01:28:10,884
- I have a plan.
- Great. Custer had a plan too.

1082
01:29:01,884 --> 01:29:03,844
We are in serious troubIe.

1083
01:29:03,884 --> 01:29:06,764
He said he had a plan.
Now just give him a chance.

1084
01:29:21,404 --> 01:29:24,244
What an idiot.
Get in here.

1085
01:29:32,684 --> 01:29:34,804
- All right, we're in.
- Nice work.

1086
01:29:39,964 --> 01:29:42,564
- What's the plan?
- I'm working on it.

1087
01:29:42,644 --> 01:29:45,204
God, what an idiot.
He's working on it.

1088
01:29:47,564 --> 01:29:49,724
This is ridiculous.

1089
01:29:49,804 --> 01:29:51,844
Hey, they're about
to start shooting at us.

1090
01:29:51,924 --> 01:29:54,404
- Good. That's fine. Let them.
- It's working.

1091
01:30:03,484 --> 01:30:07,084
- Louise, get this thing moving.
- You're dangerous, you know that?

1092
01:30:11,044 --> 01:30:12,964
Oh, this is interesting.

1093
01:30:18,604 --> 01:30:22,484
I got it figured this way.
They got one big gun and two tanks.

1094
01:30:22,564 --> 01:30:25,724
They got a hundred
Baryshnikovs running around.

1095
01:30:25,804 --> 01:30:28,004
- And what do we got?
- What do we got?

1096
01:30:28,084 --> 01:30:31,724
We got one heavily armed
recreationaI vehicle here, man.

1097
01:30:31,804 --> 01:30:34,364
Okay, find that truck,
and we find them.

1098
01:30:44,924 --> 01:30:47,404
- There's a gun in that tower, Russell.
- I see him.

1099
01:30:50,284 --> 01:30:52,404
All right, steady.

1100
01:31:03,724 --> 01:31:06,324
- Got him!
- All right! Oh, God!

1101
01:31:10,204 --> 01:31:12,124
Good one, Russell.

1102
01:31:14,444 --> 01:31:17,004
- There's the truck.
- Must be them. Get ready!

1103
01:31:20,564 --> 01:31:22,524
Out, please!

1104
01:31:30,084 --> 01:31:32,004
John, over here!

1105
01:31:53,524 --> 01:31:55,884
- That was stupid.
- Yeah.

1106
01:31:59,604 --> 01:32:01,564
- You know who would love this?
- Who?

1107
01:32:01,604 --> 01:32:04,604
Russell. He should be here.

1108
01:32:05,644 --> 01:32:07,084
Help!

1109
01:32:16,644 --> 01:32:18,484
- Thank you.
- That helped.

1110
01:32:29,484 --> 01:32:31,404
They better be in there.

1111
01:33:25,044 --> 01:33:26,964
You can beat me
as much as you want!

1112
01:33:35,524 --> 01:33:37,924
- Are you okay?
- Where are they?

1113
01:33:37,964 --> 01:33:40,644
- Hi.
- Where are the others?

1114
01:33:55,084 --> 01:33:58,044
- Who is it?
- It's ldi Amin.

1115
01:33:58,084 --> 01:34:00,564
It's Winger!

1116
01:34:00,644 --> 01:34:03,604
It's us, Winger!
Get us out!

1117
01:34:03,684 --> 01:34:06,364
Stand back from the door.
I'm gonna blow it.

1118
01:34:06,444 --> 01:34:08,244
Everybody back!

1119
01:34:10,884 --> 01:34:12,324
You get it.

1120
01:34:14,804 --> 01:34:16,524
Get down.

1121
01:34:25,964 --> 01:34:30,324
- One tough door!
- You got it locked on the inside?

1122
01:34:30,404 --> 01:34:34,404
It's because of you people
that I cannot get outside!

1123
01:34:34,484 --> 01:34:35,964
It's always your fault.

1124
01:34:36,044 --> 01:34:39,884
You are not capable of handling--
to take orders from me.

1125
01:34:39,964 --> 01:34:43,564
- Open this door!
- I'm gonna squash him!

1126
01:34:49,164 --> 01:34:53,724
- Winger! Oh, I'm so glad!
- What are you doing here?

1127
01:35:12,244 --> 01:35:14,364
Look out, Louise!
There's a tank behind us! Move it!

1128
01:35:40,484 --> 01:35:42,644
Find John, will you?
I'm gonna kill him.

1129
01:36:28,004 --> 01:36:30,124
We had a car waiting.

1130
01:37:17,124 --> 01:37:19,364
Let's get outta here!

1131
01:37:44,164 --> 01:37:45,604
We're here!

1132
01:37:56,884 --> 01:38:00,524
You're in trouble!
You're going on report!

1133
01:38:49,084 --> 01:38:52,444
There's something
blocking the road. Hang on!

1134
01:38:55,084 --> 01:38:57,964
I'm gettin' too old
for this shit!

1135
01:39:06,564 --> 01:39:09,804
Gentlemen, we are in Germany!

1136
01:40:19,604 --> 01:40:23,284
Platoon, attention!

1137
01:40:24,684 --> 01:40:27,324
Queen Anne salute!

1138
01:40:29,884 --> 01:40:31,084
Get up!

1139
01:40:46,524 --> 01:40:49,404
Thank you.
It's great to be back home.

1140
01:41:11,284 --> 01:41:13,804
My people, we're number one.
All right.

1141
01:41:21,324 --> 01:41:24,804
All right, we're getting medals.
Look. Valorous service. Thank you.

1142
01:41:27,684 --> 01:41:30,924
What the--
A surprise party!

1143
01:41:30,964 --> 01:41:34,764
I'll kill you.
Whose idea was this?

1144
01:41:34,844 --> 01:41:37,764
Everybody's coming to my place.
This is ridiculous.

1145
01:41:38,804 --> 01:41:41,244
Senator, hang onto that,
will you, for me?

1146
01:41:41,324 --> 01:41:43,964
Oh, I wrote.
I didn't know if you'd come.

1147
01:41:45,044 --> 01:41:47,004
No questions, please.

1148
01:41:47,084 --> 01:41:49,244
We just want to get back
to our hoteI rooms...

1149
01:41:49,324 --> 01:41:51,804
and have some really serious sex.

1150
01:41:54,444 --> 01:41:57,324
What are you lookin' at?
Keep your eyes out there.

1151
01:42:17,004 --> 01:42:18,844
Oh, you old dog.

1152
01:42:56,244 --> 01:42:58,844
Right face!

1153
01:42:58,924 --> 01:43:01,124
Forward march!

1154
01:43:02,724 --> 01:43:04,124
Left...

1155
01:43:04,764 --> 01:43:06,724
Left, right, lett.

1156
01:43:15,004 --> 01:43:18,604
There she was just walkin'
down the street singin'

1157
01:43:18,684 --> 01:43:22,564
Doo wah ditty
ditty dum ditty doo

1158
01:43:22,644 --> 01:43:26,524
Snapping her fingers
and shuffling her feet singin'

1159
01:43:30,044 --> 01:43:31,644
She looked good

1160
01:43:31,684 --> 01:43:33,644
She looked fine

1161
01:43:35,924 --> 01:43:37,884
And I nearly lost my mind
