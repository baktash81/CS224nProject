1
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,185
Of course,
women have always been a vital link...

2
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,397
in the lifeline
that supplies combat units.

3
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,733
The last few years have brought
real progress...

4
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:10,194
in the interests of women in
all aspects of naval service.

5
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:14,365
What's more, the Navy has instituted
special sensitivity courses...

6
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,577
for all its male recruits,
demonstrating even more progress–—

7
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:19,954
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
Mr. Hayes.

8
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:23,916
If a cannibal used a knife and fork,
would you call that progress too?

9
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:30,131
Well, perhaps, if I could just finish,
Madame Chairman, your questions–—

10
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,925
Oh, I'm just an old dame
without much time left...

11
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,803
so you'll pardon me
if I jump right in here.

12
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:40,183
I'm deeply concerned over the Navy's
seemingly incontrovertible attitude...

13
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:43,311
toward women in the military.

14
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:46,022
Case in point: the Lark Report.

15
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:51,944
Uh, Madame Chairman, this is
an internal document of the U.S. Navy.

16
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:56,699
The Navy's analysis of that F-14 crash
at Coronado last year.

17
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:59,494
Female aviator,
it just so happens.

18
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:02,997
You were party to this report.
Am I right?

19
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:06,000
I am really not prepared
to go into an in-depth–—

20
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:09,837
If you are vying for the office
of the Secretary of the Navy, Mr. Hayes...

21
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:11,964
I'd like to think
you were prepared for anything.

22
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:16,052
Especially if you're lookin'
for my confirmation.

23
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:20,556
I'm struck by the ill-spirited
tenor of your report:

24
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,809
degrading remarks
by other aviators...

25
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:26,813
innuendo about her performance
in unrelated situations.

26
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:30,566
There's even a reference here to
her sexual activity the weekend prior.

27
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:34,195
These are not
unrelated circumstances.

28
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,197
In my seven years
on this committee...

29
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:39,742
I have never seen a downed aviator
treated like this, never.

30
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:44,831
I'm deeply disturbed
by this report, Mr. Hayes.

31
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:48,376
Not just what it bodes
for the future of women in the Navy...

32
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:52,338
but your future as well.

33
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:56,467
Do you expect to take criticism
for using this confirmation hearing...

34
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:58,678
as a pulpit
for women's rights?

35
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:01,764
Look, nearly one-quarter of
all jobs in the U.S. military...

36
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:05,017
are still to this day off-limits
to women, and that has gotta change!

37
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:09,021
What about those that say women aren't
suited for all jobs, they're physically weaker?

38
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:11,023
How strong do you have to be
to pull a trigger?

39
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:14,235
That was quick.
Yeah, she did great.

40
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,863
Are you kidding?
She's always great.

41
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:18,698
Private meeting.
That's what we want.

42
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:22,702
Are you worried about the next round
of base closures, Senator?

43
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:25,788
- As long as it doesn't affect me.
- Defense boys already called.

44
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,790
They want
a private meeting with you.

45
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,917
I'll act surprised.

46
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,137
Senator, this is a contingency program
for 100 per cent integration.

47
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:45,308
If female candidates measure e up
in a series of test cases...

48
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:50,313
the D.O.D. will support full
integration within three year's time.

49
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:53,316
We get our man. You get
your gender -blind Navy, Senator.

50
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,651
Surely you’re e not gonna
balk at that.

51
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:58,070
I have to pick
the test cases.

52
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:00,323
The Navy'll want approval
over the women.

53
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:03,242
- So I'll approve their approval.
- Come on, Senator.

54
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:07,914
Let's concentrate on the steak
and not the peas.

55
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:11,125
If women measure e up to the men, they've
got the job. That's what's on the table.

56
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,671
You're not having
second thoughts, are you?

57
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:25,848
- Well, Doug?
- Congratulations, Mr. Secretary.

58
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:28,267
So, what program?

59
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:31,646
I'd go C.R.T.
Combined Reconnaissance Team.

60
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,106
SEALS.
Sixty per cent dropout r ate.

61
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,651
No woman's gonna last a week.
I don't care who she is.

62
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,111
Then I suggest
we start there.

63
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,280
Good work.

64
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,492
Hostile activity.
Mined area.

65
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:47,161
I say again:
hostile activity, mined area.

66
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:50,122
Maintaining holding action.

67
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:52,124
Carrying one wounded.

68
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:55,878
Extracting to new location
secondary P.Z. Over.

69
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:58,506
Bravo Six, this is Avalanche.

70
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,633
Negative
on secondary rendezvous.

71
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:04,512
Strongly suggest new location.
Over.

72
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:07,723
Stand by, Avalanche.
Will consult team leader.

73
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:12,853
- Bravo Six.
- Go to sea level.

74
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:15,815
Say again your last.
Over.

75
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:19,568
Bravo Six, this is Avalanche.

76
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:24,240
Bravo Six.

77
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,242
- We've lost the horizon.
- Bravo Six.

78
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,537
- You didn't account for that?
- Yes, sir, we did...

79
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:32,206
but we didn't count on the SEAL unit
being delayed for five hours...

80
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,709
and then exfiltrating
this close to this high terrain.

81
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:39,005
But Keyhole-5 will be L.O.S.
in 18 minutes, sir.

82
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,507
Launch base will need
that much time to key their gear.

83
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,843
Advise launch base
accordingly, Goldstein. Now.

84
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:46,220
Sir, I'd recommend against it.
These are skilled operators.

85
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:49,765
They've grasped their problem by now and
will take action to get back on-line.

86
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,184
It’s just a glitch
in the net changeover, sir.

87
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:54,061
I'll have it ironed out
momentarily.

88
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:57,356
Advise launch base,
Goldstein.

89
00:05:57,441 --> 00:06:00,026
Something to add,
Lieutenant?

90
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:04,238
If we keep the primary satellite, the unit can
negotiate its way down to this plateau here.

91
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,282
Reestablish comms.
It's a clear shot.

92
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,910
What about those two areas inland?
That's closer to their position.

93
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:12,038
But that's behind them.

94
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,206
They'll wanna keep moving
seaward, sir, yet find a spot...

95
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,375
that gives 'em the line of sight
on the satellite.

96
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,045
This plateau here.
That's where I'd head, sir.

97
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:23,716
Last I checked, you were a topographic
analyst, not an operations specialist.

98
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,385
- Why don't you just let it–—
- If they have wounded...

99
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,596
they might be inclined
to stay put.

100
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,973
Wait till the new bird
comes into L.O.S.

101
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:34,143
But they also know the tides are
slipping out under their recovery sub.

102
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:37,897
They'll hump their wounded out. They'll
reach this plateau in ten minutes.

103
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:40,066
Make that nine now.

104
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,235
We can't switch the net, sir.
We'll be listening for them...

105
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,572
on the wrong channel
with the wrong crypto.

106
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:52,244
Give it exactly nine minutes.

107
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,437
Okay, let's see
what the cat dragged in.

108
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:20,523
They've preapproved
all these candidates.

109
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,525
Top scores, marksmanship.

110
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:26,445
Distance runner. Took fifth place
in some intra-service marathon. Age 27.

111
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:29,949
Perfect, till they do
a chromosome check.

112
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,618
Some impressive
fitness reps here.

113
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:36,539
Holder of several records
for female power-lifting.

114
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,208
Is this the face you want to see
on the cover of Newsweek?

115
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,794
She looks like the wife
of a Russian beet farmer.

116
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,796
I like this one.

117
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,966
Triathlon, winter sports,
Olympic contender...

118
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,468
winner of the Arlie Burke
essay contest, works Intel.

119
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:54,181
- Too much of a think-tank soldier.
- No, no, show me, show me.

120
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:02,815
Well, this really is
top drawer...

121
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:06,026
with silk stockings inside.

122
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:12,324
- We've waited about as long as we dare.
- Do it.

123
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,410
Change the net.

124
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,496
Launch base,
this is N.I.C. control.

125
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:21,167
We're going to conduct
a net changeover...

126
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:24,211
to Keyhole-5 at
the following coordinates.

127
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:26,380
This is Bravo Six.
Still got six heartbeats here...

128
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,507
holding on some kind of plateau.

129
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:32,887
I say again, six passengers
looking for a ride home.

130
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:35,222
- We're good to go.
- Belay my last.

131
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:40,936
Copy that. Maintain perimeter.
Advise further hostile status.

132
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,905
- That was good headwork, Lieutenant.
- Well, thank you, sir.

133
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:53,324
I'm glad we could get
involved and do some good.

134
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:57,036
Now the problem is,
Intel officers don't get involved.

135
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,331
We monitor, analyze.

136
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,042
You need to learn
the fine art of detachment, Lieutenant.

137
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,711
Excuse me, there's a call
from the Sec Nav's office.

138
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,546
- I'll take it inside.
- No, sir, excuse me.

139
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:09,715
Lieutenant O'Neil,
the call's for you.

140
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,259
I'll take it inside.

141
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:17,973
Thanks for holding.
I'll put you through.

142
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,084
I'm thinking about redoing
the place.

143
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:48,337
It's beginning to remind me
of an old whorehouse over the years.

144
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,674
- Good evening, ma'am.
- Good evening, Lieutenant.

145
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,676
Ma'am, may I ask
what this is regarding?

146
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,178
- Didn't they tell you?
- No, ma'am.

147
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:59,181
Well, this'll be a toot.
You read, I'll pour.

148
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,998
It's jus t a test case, Jordan...

149
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:27,042
but if things work out,
if you can go the distance...

150
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:32,214
it could well change the military's
official policy on women in combat.

151
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:36,051
Or, actually,
its official non-policy.

152
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:39,847
Begging your pardon,
Senator...

153
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:43,183
but you do understand this
involves SEAL training?

154
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,978
I do.
I also understand...

155
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:49,481
that you applied for active duty
during the Gulf War and got turned down.

156
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:53,569
Yes, ma'am, there was an Intel slot
available aboard the U.S.S. Polk...

157
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:57,156
but they told me that submarines
had no bathroom facilities for women.

158
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,826
- Did that piss you off?
- Yes, ma'am, it did.

159
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,079
Good. I like pissed off.

160
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:09,418
- Sit down, Lieutenant.
- Yes, ma'am.

161
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:18,552
Have you got a man?

162
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:21,430
- Ma'am?
- At home?

163
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:25,517
Fiancé. Steady beau. You know,
some kind of solid heterosexual.

164
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:29,605
I hate askin', but I don't want
this thing blowin' up in our faces...

165
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,857
if you happen to be battin'
for the other side.

166
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,610
Yes, ma'am, there's someone.

167
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,404
Well, wonderful.

168
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:45,537
Honey, come on'. I survived jump school,
dive school and three brothers.

169
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,539
I think I can take care
of myself '.

170
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:50,751
The only thing that scares me
are the sexual politics.

171
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:54,421
I'm just not interested in being
some poster girl for women's rights.

172
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,760
- What?
- Hmm?

173
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,221
- What?
- What?

174
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,807
You don't have anything
to say about this?

175
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:07,643
I guess I don't.

176
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:11,146
Honey, this is just
a career opportunity.

177
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,732
You don't want me sleeping my way
to the top, do you?

178
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:15,776
But the SEALS, babe?

179
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,278
These guys are world-class warriors.
They see you coming–—

180
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:20,406
- I mean–—
- I'm aware they may not want me there.

181
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,074
- "May not"?
- Yes.

182
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:25,744
They will eat corn flakes
out of your skull. Okay?

183
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:29,206
To tell you the truth...

184
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,417
I don't get it.

185
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,752
I mean, you're doing
shit-hot at Intel'.

186
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:37,005
Why do you wanna go off
and play soldier girl for?

187
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,515
Royce, we're the same age.
We entered the Navy the same month.

188
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,934
Which one of us
is wearing more ribbons?

189
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:52,187
Oh, come on. This is just 'cause
I got lucky during the Gulf War.

190
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:55,107
Yes, thank you'. Operational experience
is a key to advancement.

191
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:59,111
Yet anyone with tits can't be on a sub,
can't be a SEAL, and don't even think–—

192
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,113
Hey, whoa.
If you made up your mind to do it, go.

193
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:05,200
You always do what you wanna do anyway.
Don't ask my permission.

194
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:10,122
You wanna go off and live with a bunch of
cock-swinging commandos for three months–—

195
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,124
Three months?

196
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:16,170
What if I make this and go operational
for three years? What then?

197
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:19,840
Oh, man, did I just miss
a decade or something?

198
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,968
Will I wait if you go off to war?
Is that what you're asking me?

199
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:27,181
Yeah, something like that.
Exactly like that.

200
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:31,185
I didn't know I was gonna have to decide
the rest of my life tonight, Jordan.

201
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:33,228
Maybe we should just
let this happen.

202
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,149
Get your dick back in here.

203
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:41,153
Don't ask me to tell you how I'm gonna
feel in three years. I don't know.

204
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,155
I mean, neither do you.

205
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:46,158
Right up until you said that,
I thought I did.

206
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:23,278
Carry on.

207
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:26,698
Put it down! Here we go!

208
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:53,809
Lieutenant O'Neil
reporting for training, sir.

209
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,907
Yes, of course.

210
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:11,910
Please, Lieutenant,
have a seat.

211
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:13,954
Thank you, sir.

212
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,628
Would you care for a beverage?
Tea? Soda?

213
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:25,299
- I'm fine, sir.
- You sure?

214
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:30,762
Well, we're still coming to
terms with the exact protocol...

215
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:33,765
for the integration
of our SEAL C.R.T. training.

216
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:37,769
- Barber was my next stop, sir. I–—
- Don't worry about it.

217
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:41,940
As long as it's off your collar, out of
your eyes, that's all I'm going to ask.

218
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:44,860
Sir, I'm not looking
for any special treatment.

219
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:48,238
We're not trying to change
your sex, Lieutenant.

220
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:51,450
You'll have a separate bed,
a separate head.

221
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:54,661
If you have any special medical needs,
inform the infirmary.

222
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:58,290
If your classmates or a superior
acts in a harassing...

223
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,626
or otherwise unbecoming manner...

224
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,211
you are to inform me
immediately...

225
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,339
so that I can deal with it
immediately.

226
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:08,634
It may not always run smooth...

227
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:11,803
but we're trying to make it
as painless as possible.

228
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:15,724
Thank you, sir, but I expect
a certain amount of pain.

229
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:20,228
- Any questions?
- None at this time, sir.

230
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,856
Then we're done, Lieutenant.

231
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,900
Yes, sir.

232
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,237
Permission to speak, sir?

233
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:33,825
I'm not here to make
some kind of statement.

234
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:37,496
I care about completing the training
and getting operational experience...

235
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,581
just like everyone else,
I suspect.

236
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,834
If you were like everyone else,
Lieutenant...

237
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:46,171
I suspect we wouldn't be
making statements...

238
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,215
about not making statements...

239
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:51,009
would we?

240
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:53,595
- Dismissed.
- Aye-aye, sir.

241
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,298
Come on.

242
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:08,128
Average woman, 25 percent body fat.
Twenty-five.

243
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:11,590
That's a quarter fat, man.
I mean, think about that.

244
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:13,550
If she pulls her own weight,
I got no problem with it.

245
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:17,262
No split-tail's getting through
this program. No way, Jose.

246
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:32,527
Oh, man, doesn't she know
it's rude to point?

247
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:36,990
Whoo-hoo!

248
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:40,410
Look, I don't know what she did
to get in here. I hate to speculate.

249
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:43,789
I know I petitioned for two years
to get into this program.

250
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:45,791
Two years of letter writing,
two years of pulling strings...

251
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,709
and I finally get here,
and it's gone co-ed?

252
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:52,672
Elite combat unit.
Whose genius idea was that?

253
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:55,842
That's bullshit. I mean, they can't do
what we can. How's it happen?

254
00:18:55,927 --> 00:19:00,347
All I'm sayin' is one night, Lord. Give
me one night, and I'll set her straight.

255
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:05,185
Slovnik's feeling good
like a hard man should.

256
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:09,022
Stow it, gentlemen.
You heard the policy.

257
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,732
Attention on deck!

258
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,757
Stand easy.

259
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:44,099
Welcome to SEAL C.R.T.
selection program.

260
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:48,687
You have volunteered for
the most intensive military training...

261
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:50,689
known to man.

262
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:55,360
You are all proven operators
within the spec ops community.

263
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,447
SEALS...

264
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,616
E.O. D...

265
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:05,579
Army Delta,
Marine Force Recon...

266
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,747
Naval intel community...

267
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:11,126
and so on.

268
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,337
In spite of your expertise...

269
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:19,426
many of you will not successfully
negotiate this program.

270
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:24,389
Those that do will experience
an operational tempo...

271
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:29,394
that far exceeds that of any unit
within the U.S. arsenal.

272
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,855
That is all
that is to be said...

273
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:36,401
about the special nature
of the C.R.T. training program.

274
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:39,738
I now turn you over...

275
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:43,742
to my Command Master Chief
John James Urgayle.

276
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:46,578
Attention!

277
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:50,123
Instructors, stand easy.

278
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:18,944
I never saw a wild thing
sorry for itself

279
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:25,617
A bird will fall frozen dead
from a bough...

280
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:30,956
without ever having felt
sorry for itself.

281
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:49,140
The ebb and flow
of the Atlantic tides...

282
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:51,768
the drift of the continents...

283
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:57,273
the very position of the sun
along its ecliptic.

284
00:21:57,358 --> 00:22:01,903
These are just a few of the things
I control in my world.

285
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:09,661
- Is that clear?
- Yes, Command Master Chief!

286
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,913
Instructor Pyro.

287
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:14,165
Aye-aye, Master Chief.

288
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,209
Instructors.

289
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:21,006
Boat crews, stand by your boats.
Move your asses!

290
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:29,723
Get 'em up high!
Move your asses!

291
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:31,433
Get 'em up high!

292
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:34,269
Forward, double time!
Hut!

293
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:46,364
Hold them up, girls.
Come on. Don't you embarrass me.

294
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:49,451
Get that up!

295
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:56,291
What are you people, handicapped?
Get your feet up! Move it!

296
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,461
This day hasn't even begun!
Move it around!

297
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:01,588
Move the boat around!

298
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:04,090
Prepare to down boat!

299
00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:07,469
Down boat, and don't you bruise
my sensitive fanny!

300
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:09,888
I will run your butt
all the way to the beach!

301
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:13,641
I have had better boat rides
by your mothers!

302
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,977
Worm sperm,
every damn one of you!

303
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:20,982
Instructor, get these spoon-chested
pencil-necks out of my face!

304
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:24,819
All yours, Master Chief

305
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:29,532
Take a good look
at your new home.

306
00:23:29,617 --> 00:23:31,576
Clarkson, get your boat crews!
Fall out by the fenders now!

307
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:35,455
Move it, move it,
move it, move it!

308
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:52,263
Sixty percent of you
will not pass this course!

309
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:56,684
How do I know? Because that is
an historical fact!

310
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:58,728
Now for the bad news!

311
00:23:58,813 --> 00:24:01,731
I always like to get
one quitter on the first day!

312
00:24:01,816 --> 00:24:04,484
And until I do,
that first day does not end!

313
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:07,112
Look around! Look to your right!

314
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:10,782
Look to your left.
I just wonder who it's gonna be.

315
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:14,702
Who's got the hair
to stick it out?

316
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:17,372
Come on! Be a part
of your crew's solution!

317
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,630
- There's one goin' down!
- What are you doing on your knees?

318
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:28,133
- Stamm, are you hurt?
- No!

319
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:31,719
You wanna quit? Then get the fuck up,
Stamm! Get back on that fender!

320
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:36,349
- Get up, guy! What the hell is going on?
- Flea. Flea, you all right?

321
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:39,769
- What the fuck you doin' with him?
- Whoo-hoo!

322
00:24:39,854 --> 00:24:42,355
- What's your name, pancake?
- Flea! I mean, Montgomery, sir!

323
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:46,442
Don't call me sir, moron. I work for a living.
How many names you got anyway?

324
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:49,696
It, s F. Lee Montgomery, but that
just gets whittled down to Flea.

325
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:53,158
- Are you my quitter, Mr. Flea?
- No, sir, Master Chief!

326
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:55,660
Nothin' to be ashamed of, sir.
Do you wanna quit?

327
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:58,037
Not me, Master Chief!
I'm full of joy!

328
00:24:58,122 --> 00:25:00,915
What the hell is going on
down there?

329
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,126
Move that fender!

330
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:13,887
Class!
Class, stand in line!

331
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:17,765
Drop down, bent over push-ups!

332
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:21,269
Quit playing with your hair,
O'Neil, and drop down!

333
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,271
If you can't do these right,
O'Neil, do 'em on your knees!

334
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,898
I like these just fine, sir.

335
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:29,194
Down!

336
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,323
Half a night, Lord.
Just give me half a night.

337
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:36,910
- Cortez, stow the shit!
- I'm just having a sexual fantasy here!

338
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:40,163
You have to be harder
than the average man...

339
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:43,333
to even get in
this program!

340
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:48,129
But I know some of you are already
thinking seriously about quitting!

341
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:49,672
Get in this program, Stamm!

342
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:52,217
Come on!
You don't need this abuse!

343
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:56,888
Stamm, I think I have a quitter!
Do I have a quitter?

344
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:59,474
Be ashamed for the rest
of your fucking lives!

345
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:05,480
Go!

346
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:09,734
Get out of that water!

347
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,319
Roll! Right there!

348
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:14,572
Roll!

349
00:26:18,661 --> 00:26:21,871
Pain is your friend,
your ally!

350
00:26:21,956 --> 00:26:26,376
It will tell you
when you are seriously injured!

351
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,879
It will keep you awake
and angry...

352
00:26:29,964 --> 00:26:32,465
and remind you to finish
the job...

353
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,509
and get the hell home!

354
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:38,388
But you know the best thing
about pain?

355
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:40,390
I don't know!

356
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:42,850
It lets you know
you're not dead yet!

357
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,788
I've seen Girl Scouts
move quicker than this!

358
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:07,917
You people are pathetic!
Down boat!

359
00:27:08,002 --> 00:27:10,795
Mr. Wickwire,
you have four minutes...

360
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:13,464
to secure swim gear
and down chow!

361
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:16,467
Your entire class will
be severely penalized...

362
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:24,767
Get your asses going!
Get moving!

363
00:27:24,852 --> 00:27:28,771
Goddamn it, what the fuck are you doing
sitting in my chair?

364
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:32,608
Get the hell out of here!

365
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:35,695
Scrape your plates!
Get the hell out of here!

366
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:39,240
Get your ass up! Get your ass up!
Get it up, boy!

367
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:53,421
Get the hell out of here!

368
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,341
Scrape the plates
and get the hell out of here!

369
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:01,471
I want you to stroll!
Drop down!

370
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:06,225
Bear crawl, goddamn it! What the hell's
wrong with you, shithead?

371
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,728
# I love the way you walk #

372
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:11,814
# I'm treated by your walk #

373
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:15,777
# I love the way you walk
to that beat #

374
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:17,862
# I got my eyes on you ##

375
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,582
All right, sewer trout,
everybody out!

376
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,584
Move it out!

377
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:34,629
Get in line
and get up here, people!

378
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,714
Keep the whole line long!

379
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,634
Move it, move it, move it!

380
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,136
Get on line!
Get on line right here!

381
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:45,890
- Get on line!
- All right, fall in! Dress it up!

382
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:49,227
Get ready
for your med check!

383
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:51,479
They're all yours,
Lieutenant.

384
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:54,565
What's your name?

385
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:57,527
- Newberry.
- What day of the week is it, Newberry?

386
00:28:57,611 --> 00:29:00,822
- It's fucking cold. That's what day of the week it is.
- Follow my finger.

387
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,742
That's good.

388
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:07,453
- What's your name?
- McCool.

389
00:29:07,538 --> 00:29:09,622
- Uh-huh. Where are you from?
- San Diego.

390
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:11,707
San Diego.
Follow my finger.

391
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,505
- What's your name?
- O'Neil.

392
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,715
All right,
follow my finger, O'Neil.

393
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:24,095
- Let me see your fingertips. Cold?
- Yeah.

394
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,514
Way to gut it out,
Lieutenant.

395
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,725
All right, corpsmen, they're
gonna live. Get the hell out of there.

396
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,561
Class, fall out for chow.

397
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:36,232
Move. I said move, goddamn it! What
do you want to do, take another swim?

398
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:39,110
Maybe we don't want
chow tonight.

399
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:42,113
Move your girlie butts!

400
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:49,495
After you pack grits, report
to Alpha barracks on the double.

401
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:54,167
Get them dick-skinning hands out of my
garbage cans. What the hell's goin' on?

402
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:56,878
I told you, get your chow
and report to Alpha barracks!

403
00:29:56,962 --> 00:30:01,591
If you feel
you cannot carry on–—

404
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:04,802
If you now care to admit
that you are woefully out of your depth...

405
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:08,264
that bell is your salvation.

406
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,641
Strike it three times,
and you're out.

407
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:13,352
Free to get a hot shower
and a good night's sleep.

408
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:15,938
I know you're saying
to yourself...

409
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:18,483
"I'm an experienced operator.

410
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:21,110
"I've put up with
19 straight hours of this.

411
00:30:21,195 --> 00:30:24,614
Do I really need
another 12 weeks?"

412
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:29,118
If you don't know the answer to
that question, you do not belong here.

413
00:30:29,203 --> 00:30:31,996
- Back up, guys. Back up.
- That's all right...

414
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,790
'cause this program
is not for everyone.

415
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:38,836
Just step up to the bell,
save us all a lot of trouble.

416
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:42,298
Go ahead.
Any takers?

417
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,509
Goin' once.

418
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:49,305
Goin' twice.

419
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:54,602
All right,
welcome to a brand-new day.

420
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,480
# I was lost #

421
00:30:57,564 --> 00:31:01,859
- Come on, now!
- # In a world of light #

422
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:04,445
- # I always did #
- I did it, y'all!

423
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:07,532
- # What was right #
- Hang on!

424
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:09,784
# But now I sing #

425
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,245
# A different song #

426
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:16,082
# And I found joy #

427
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:18,125
- # In doing it wrong #
- Sing it!

428
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,628
# I found a friend #

429
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:24,173
- Yeah!
- # In Satan #

430
00:31:24,258 --> 00:31:27,218
- # I found a friend #
- Uh-huh!

431
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:30,346
- # In Satan #
- Stamm, don't do it, Stamm!

432
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:33,599
- # I found a friend ##
- Come on, Stamm! Don't quit!

433
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:36,561
Come on, Stamm!

434
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:45,027
There goes Stamm.

435
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:48,281
Dilettante.

436
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:52,368
- Slow day at the office.
- Dropped on request.

437
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:57,081
In no less than 500
neatly printed words...

438
00:31:57,165 --> 00:32:00,585
tell me why you love
the United States Navy.

439
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:05,423
There will be no time limit
for this evolution.

440
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:12,054
Put that pencil down. Get your fucking
feet together and sit up straight!

441
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,767
You will write
when I tell you to write.

442
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:26,068
When I come back,
I'll be countin' open eyes. Begin.

443
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:06,627
Master Chief.
Rock and roll.

444
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:31,944
Favorable weather conditions
for the next evolution.

445
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:35,322
Are you ready, Lieutenant?

446
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:40,244
Pencils down!
On your feet! Get up!

447
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:43,289
Are you ready
for the next evolution?

448
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:45,499
Hoo-yah, Instructor Pyro!

449
00:34:50,213 --> 00:35:01,098
Hoo-hah!

450
00:35:01,183 --> 00:35:03,726
Class, halt!

451
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,270
Right face!

452
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:10,441
Sling arms!

453
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:13,569
- Fall out! Close it in!
- Evenin', cupcakes.

454
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:17,782
Twelve minutes or less. That's all
you need to know about this course.

455
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:19,909
Group one: Newberry...

456
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:23,913
Hampton, McCool, Wickwire,
Slovnik and England.

457
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:28,751
Group two: Miller, Flea, Powell,
Ayres, Cortez and O'Neil.

458
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:32,797
You will find a white step
that is mandated female aid, O'Neil.

459
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:35,007
You will find and use them
on every barrier obstacle.

460
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:38,636
- Sergeant, I don't wanna use any step.
- Keep your mouth shut!

461
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,890
- I wanna go through like the rest of the guys!
- Shut your fucking hole!

462
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:48,145
Group three: Marshall, DeLuise,
Brown, Simons, Flynn and Stow.

463
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:51,273
Group one, stand by!

464
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:53,275
Bust 'em!

465
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,985
Hoo-yah!

466
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,780
Group two, stand by!

467
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,407
Bust 'em!

468
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:04,995
Group three, stand by!
Bust 'em!

469
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,248
Move, move, move, move,
move, move!

470
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:43,951
- Move it! Keep moving!
- Faster!

471
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:54,920
O'Neil, let's go!
Let's move it on down!

472
00:36:55,005 --> 00:36:57,923
You want me
to get you a dress?

473
00:36:58,008 --> 00:37:00,676
- Keep it moving! Let's go!
- Do you squat when you pee?

474
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,845
Come on!

475
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:07,308
- Go, go, go! Go!
- This way!

476
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:10,561
- Go, go, go!
- Keep it clear! Move it!

477
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:19,653
Flea!

478
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:22,489
Let's move! Let's run!

479
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:41,342
Move, move, move!

480
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:45,846
Into the tunnel!
Now!

481
00:37:54,356 --> 00:37:57,232
Get up! Come on!

482
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:16,543
Cortez, get over here!
Drop down. Come on!

483
00:38:17,671 --> 00:38:19,797
Come on! Come on, Flea!

484
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:26,553
Come on!

485
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:31,392
- Come on!
- Go!

486
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:34,979
- That's it!
- Help me up, Jordan.

487
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,943
Come on.

488
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:51,078
Grab my hand.
Give me your hand.

489
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:55,666
Why don't you quit, O'Neil?

490
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:58,836
Quit now.

491
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:05,801
Let's go,
children. Come on. Let's go, Cortez.

492
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:08,971
It pays to be a winner.
Come on, move your fat ass.

493
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:12,099
Oh, this would be a fine time to quit,
wouldn't it, gentlemen?

494
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,518
How many quitters we got?
Come on! Move it!

495
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:18,981
Get on up here, mud muffins. Come on.
You guys look like sea slugs.

496
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:21,984
O'Neil! What are you
waitin' for, girl?

497
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,987
Get your fine fanny
down here!

498
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:28,741
Come on, move it!
Move it, O'Neil!

499
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:31,035
Oh, my God!

500
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:35,205
O'Neil just tripped the trip wire!
Thank you very much!

501
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:37,708
She is responsible for
killing the entire class.

502
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:41,128
- Hoo-yah, O'Neil!
- Hoo-yah, O'Neil!

503
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:48,218
Newberry: 13:08.

504
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:51,430
Cortez: 13:10.

505
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:55,476
Hampton: 13:15.
Blake: 13:22.

506
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,228
Presley: 13:47.

507
00:39:58,313 --> 00:40:01,398
Pretty boy:
14 minutes flat.

508
00:40:01,483 --> 00:40:04,026
You are the blue-ribbon loser.

509
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,028
These six have failed
the "O" course.

510
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:09,907
- These six will run the course again.
- No, don't do it!

511
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:13,285
Come on, man! Hang in there!

512
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:17,122
Come on!

513
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:23,545
Anybody else?

514
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,089
All right.

515
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:27,925
The rest of you wanna-bes have two hours
before the next evolution.

516
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:30,928
I strongly suggest
you spend it in your racks...

517
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:32,721
or sick bay.

518
00:40:32,806 --> 00:40:35,891
- Mr. Wickwire.
- Ten-hut!

519
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:38,435
Muster back here at 0800...

520
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,437
in your greens.

521
00:40:40,522 --> 00:40:42,439
Haul out!

522
00:40:42,524 --> 00:40:45,526
Class! As you were.

523
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:58,247
Sergeant Cortez...

524
00:40:58,331 --> 00:41:02,793
however brief your stay
with this command might be...

525
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:06,588
there are two words you will learn
to put together:

526
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:10,425
Team... mate.

527
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,638
Carry on.

528
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,640
Wickwire, you heard him.
What are you waitin' for?

529
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,142
Fall out. Move it!

530
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,187
- Hoo-yah!
- Hoo-yah!

531
00:41:22,272 --> 00:41:25,190
What do we have here,
you hesitant bunch of harlots?

532
00:41:25,275 --> 00:41:27,192
You thinkin' about ringin' that bell?
Don't think! Move!

533
00:41:27,277 --> 00:41:31,029
Come on, somebody ring that bell
for me, please!

534
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:35,159
Come on, honey bun, walk!
Get your bell-bangin' balls a-rollin'!

535
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:37,661
You can be home
curled up in bed...

536
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:40,164
in less than four hours!

537
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:42,166
Ring that bell!

538
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:46,170
That is music to my ears.
I'm gettin' emotional here.

539
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:48,672
Anybody else?

540
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,841
What's the matter,
O'Neil?

541
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:54,887
Come on.

542
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:26,168
I'd like to see
the Master Chief.

543
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:30,505
Lieutenant O'Neil requests
to speak to the Master Chief.

544
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:33,175
He's not home.

545
00:42:34,928 --> 00:42:36,845
Excuse me, Master Chief.

546
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:40,057
Cortez finished ahead of me in group
two, but he failed and I didn't. Why?

547
00:42:40,141 --> 00:42:44,061
Instructor Pyro,
educate the lieutenant.

548
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:47,064
You received an automatic
30-second deduction...

549
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:49,066
which put you
under the wire.

550
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,068
It's called gender-norming,
O'Neil.

551
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:54,279
It's standard procedure
for all females in physical training.

552
00:42:54,364 --> 00:42:57,699
What "all females,"
if I'm the only one?

553
00:42:57,784 --> 00:42:59,701
I think I should have
the choice.

554
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:03,538
Stand at attention.

555
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:07,793
Lieutenant O'Neil, when I want
your opinion, I'll give it to ya.

556
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:27,854
Did you take this matter up
with my Command Master Chief?

557
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:30,774
I believe you instructed me to come
directly to you, sir...

558
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:33,777
if I felt I was being
mistreated in any way.

559
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,529
Oh.

560
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:42,119
All right, Lieutenant.

561
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:45,497
I want names.
I want specific grievances.

562
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:48,000
Permission
to speak frankly, sir?

563
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:51,753
It's you, sir.

564
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:56,341
- It started the moment I came here.
- Oh? Really?

565
00:43:56,426 --> 00:43:58,552
It's the double standard.

566
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:02,139
The separate quarters,
the deferential treatment.

567
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:06,143
It's the way you practically pulled
my chair out for me when we first met.

568
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:09,980
Because I was civil,
now you’re complainin'?

569
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:11,982
I can't afford civility, sir.

570
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:16,111
How am I supposed to fit in when
you've got me set up as an outsider?

571
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:19,489
You've given me
a different set of rules.

572
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:21,825
The answer is, I can't.

573
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:25,329
Why don't you just issue me a
pink petticoat to wear around the base?

574
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:27,956
Did you just have
a brain fart?

575
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:30,834
Begging your pardon,
sir?

576
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:34,046
Did you
just waltz in here...

577
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:36,590
and bark at your
commanding officer?

578
00:44:38,134 --> 00:44:42,721
If so, I regard that
as a bona fide brain fart...

579
00:44:44,057 --> 00:44:47,684
and I resent it
when people fart inside my office.

580
00:44:47,769 --> 00:44:50,687
I think you’ve resented me
from the start, sir.

581
00:44:50,772 --> 00:44:53,357
What I resent,
Lieutenant...

582
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:55,942
is some politician...

583
00:44:56,027 --> 00:44:58,945
using my base
as a test tube...

584
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:02,366
for her grand
social experiment.

585
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:04,368
What I resent...

586
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:06,745
is the sensitivity
training...

587
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:09,039
that is now mandatory
for my men...

588
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:12,376
the OB-GYN
I have to keep on staff...

589
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:16,171
just so someone can keep track
of your personal Pap smears.

590
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:18,882
But most of all,
what I resent...

591
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,884
is your perfume...

592
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:24,096
however subtle it may be...

593
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:28,725
competin' with the aroma
of my fine $3.59 cigar...

594
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:30,936
which I will put out
this instant...

595
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:33,939
if the phallic nature of it
happens to offend...

596
00:45:34,023 --> 00:45:36,900
your goddamned
fragile sensibilities!

597
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:39,361
- Does it?
- No, sir.

598
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:41,488
"No, sir," what?

599
00:45:43,324 --> 00:45:45,325
The shape
doesn't bother me, sir.

600
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:47,536
Just the goddamned
sweet stench.

601
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:01,425
One standard.

602
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:04,094
Just treat me the same.
No better, no worse.

603
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:08,432
You're gonna get
everything you want, O'Neil.

604
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:11,435
Let’s just see if you want
what you're gonna get.

605
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:14,104
Hoo-yah, sir.

606
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:23,113
Hey–—

607
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:25,157
Hello?

608
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,786
Anybody here?

609
00:46:29,871 --> 00:46:34,291
#Just didn't wanna
tell you #

610
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:37,210
# Oh, see, this way I'm #

611
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:41,256
# Havin' fun
with my new song #

612
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:46,261
# Wild circumstance #

613
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:48,763
# Who would've guessed #

614
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:51,850
# Forced my hand #

615
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:55,395
# When I was homeless #

616
00:46:55,480 --> 00:47:01,026
#Just didn't understand #

617
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:03,653
# If you saw me #

618
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:08,450
# Holding his hand #

619
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:12,871
# I fell #

620
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:16,166
# From your grace #

621
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,418
# Isn't that insane #

622
00:47:18,503 --> 00:47:20,253
# I'm jealous #

623
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:26,218
# I didn't wanna tell you #

624
00:47:26,302 --> 00:47:27,636
# To your face #

625
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,138
# But I left claims #

626
00:47:30,223 --> 00:47:34,476
# That you couldn't refuse #

627
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,645
# Obvious #

628
00:47:36,729 --> 00:47:39,981
# Your friends will see #

629
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:44,736
# I knew you’d get the word
eventually #

630
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:48,198
# I'd rather have them #

631
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:51,660
# Tell you #

632
00:47:51,744 --> 00:47:54,704
# It’s just as well #

633
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:56,748
# The bitch is gone ##

634
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:52,804
Grab your sacks!
Get in line now! Move!

635
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:54,889
Who do you think you are,
coming in here?

636
00:48:54,974 --> 00:48:55,974
Guess I'm your roommate.

637
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:58,977
N–— N–— No. You can't stay here.

638
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:02,063
- You can't sleep here right next to me.
- The C.O. says I can.

639
00:49:02,148 --> 00:49:04,065
No–— Come here.
Come here!

640
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:06,067
Cortez, come here,
goddang it!

641
00:49:06,152 --> 00:49:09,988
Look it. Girlfriend bring all her stuff
in here like she think she gonna–—

642
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:11,823
- Hey!
- Shit! This is Tampax!

643
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:13,950
- Stand at attention!
- This is not gonna happen.

644
00:49:14,035 --> 00:49:16,536
Stand at attention!

645
00:49:22,335 --> 00:49:24,753
Mr. Wickwire,
in your leisure time...

646
00:49:24,837 --> 00:49:28,131
make out a schedule that rotates
head and shower usage.

647
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:30,675
Yes, Master Chief

648
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:39,434
Anything else we can do
for your celebrity career, Lieutenant?

649
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:42,812
- That'll be all–—
- You now have exactly one minute to muster!

650
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:46,316
If even one of you
Van Winkle wanna-bes are late...

651
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,943
I will personally see
none of you sleep for a week!

652
00:49:49,028 --> 00:49:52,697
Let me get this straight:
We're sharing the same fucking head?

653
00:49:52,782 --> 00:49:55,200
Listen, you moron,
I am here to stay.

654
00:49:55,284 --> 00:50:00,163
If you don't wanna be in my life, move out
or ring out. That's it. End of file.

655
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:02,123
You got one minute
to put your fuckin' clothes on.

656
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:04,000
- What about the tampons?
- Hey, hey, hey.

657
00:50:04,085 --> 00:50:07,504
- Don't you care about tampons?
- Get over yourself, Slovnik.

658
00:50:07,588 --> 00:50:10,465
- Put your clothes on. Let's go!
- Nice.

659
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:12,550
- Here we go.
- Here we go!

660
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:21,184
Pick 'em up!
Put 'em down!

661
00:50:25,314 --> 00:50:27,273
I'll have another one.

662
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:30,944
Thanks a lot.

663
00:50:33,114 --> 00:50:35,865
Oh, congratulations,
Mr. Secretary.

664
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:38,702
Say hello to the President
for me, will you?

665
00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:41,246
So, what was the deal you made
with the devil? I mean, DeHaven.

666
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:43,248
- Oooh.
- Didn't you hear?

667
00:50:43,332 --> 00:50:46,251
Effective immediately,
all vessels in the Navy...

668
00:50:46,335 --> 00:50:48,378
can no longer
be referred to as "she. "

669
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:51,423
We're to call it "it. "

670
00:50:54,135 --> 00:50:57,053
- Royce, we need a fourth.
- Yes, sir.

671
00:50:57,138 --> 00:50:59,806
- You're it.
- Thank you, sir.

672
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:05,562
- Hello!
- Congratulations on the new job.

673
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:08,106
- You'll make a fine–—
- Mr. Secretary, sir.

674
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:12,569
Oh, man.

675
00:51:12,653 --> 00:51:15,572
Not playing down to the abilities
of your superior officer, are you?

676
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:17,741
No, sir. Snooker’s just
not my game.

677
00:51:17,825 --> 00:51:19,743
Too many balls
on the table.

678
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:24,038
Distracting, isn't it? That one
pink ball right in the middle.

679
00:51:28,878 --> 00:51:31,087
- Who's got a cigar?
- Didn't know you smoked, sir.

680
00:51:31,172 --> 00:51:35,091
I don't. I just want to chew
the hell out of it.

681
00:51:35,176 --> 00:51:38,595
Uh, "The woman, identity unknown,
is believed to be...

682
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:43,308
"the first female candidate for
the elite Navy SEALS training program.

683
00:51:43,392 --> 00:51:46,311
Her presence could signal a shift
in the military's–—"

684
00:51:46,395 --> 00:51:49,230
These were supposed to have been
discreet test cases.

685
00:51:49,315 --> 00:51:51,232
That was
the agreement.

686
00:51:51,317 --> 00:51:54,944
Suppose this lady's getting friendly
with the press?

687
00:51:55,029 --> 00:51:59,991
It's DeHaven. Had to be. She is gonna
milk this cow on all four tits.

688
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:04,162
In the last two hours my office
has received 14 requests for interviews.

689
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:06,581
No interviews.
That's the last thing we need.

690
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:09,542
Where is she in the training,
this woman?

691
00:52:11,921 --> 00:52:15,173
We'll have that information
for you before the night's out.

692
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:20,136
It's my understanding that she just
finished the P.T. phase of her training.

693
00:52:20,221 --> 00:52:22,138
She made it
through hell week.

694
00:52:22,223 --> 00:52:24,307
Won't last one week,
huh?

695
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:28,436
So, have you been monitoring
this situation for us, Commander?

696
00:52:28,521 --> 00:52:32,315
No, sir. I just made
some unofficial inquiries.

697
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:34,818
Well, make it official.

698
00:52:34,902 --> 00:52:39,030
I want a brief back in my office
once a week.

699
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:43,159
G.I. Jane. Why don't they just get it
over with and call her Joan of Arc?

700
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:49,082
Your shot, Gary.

701
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:06,057
Pardon me, sir. Phone call
from Senator DeHaven.

702
00:53:07,101 --> 00:53:09,018
Captain Salem here.

703
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:12,021
Are you in the habit of lettin'
photographers traipse around your base...

704
00:53:12,106 --> 00:53:14,023
snapping their fill?

705
00:53:14,108 --> 00:53:17,151
These are supposed to be
discreet test cases.

706
00:53:17,236 --> 00:53:21,072
Senator, they stand out on a
public highway using telephoto lenses.

707
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:24,075
There is nothin'
I can do about it...

708
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:26,828
unless you want me to infringe
on their civil liberties...

709
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:32,166
which I'll be glad to do if you’ll just
trim a little fat off the Constitution.

710
00:53:32,251 --> 00:53:35,879
Did you just mouth off to a senior
member of the Senate Arms Committee?

711
00:53:35,963 --> 00:53:39,257
I'll give you points for style,
just nothin' for smarts.

712
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:42,760
- I was just explaining–—
- From this point forward, I want all press matters...

713
00:53:42,845 --> 00:53:44,762
coordinated via my office.

714
00:53:44,847 --> 00:53:46,556
Let me handle the R.P.M.

715
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:50,226
I'll be goddamned if I'm gonna watch
Hayes pull flowers out of his ass...

716
00:53:50,311 --> 00:53:52,228
and take credit
for this one.

717
00:53:52,313 --> 00:53:56,190
I'll be sure to pass your request along
to my chain of command.

718
00:53:56,275 --> 00:53:58,192
Good.

719
00:53:58,277 --> 00:54:00,653
Now, how's my girl
doin', anyway?

720
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:05,909
You need to know
what it feels like to drown...

721
00:54:05,993 --> 00:54:09,120
in order
to avoid panic...

722
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:12,874
and perhaps gain those few seconds
that just might save your life.

723
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:17,086
The natural tendency
toward premature panic...

724
00:54:17,171 --> 00:54:20,423
is what makes this such an effective
interrogation technique.

725
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:28,222
# Mama told me
not to come #

726
00:54:30,851 --> 00:54:33,436
# That ain't the way
to have fun, no #

727
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,271
# Uh-uh #

728
00:54:35,356 --> 00:54:37,148
Carb 15.
Military designator: M4.

729
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:40,610
Nothing more than a chopped-down
version of the M16 assault rifle.

730
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:42,904
By taking the proper
precautions...

731
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:45,782
this weapon can be considered
water-resistant.

732
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:49,494
Many techniques have been developed
to seal the muzzle of the weapon.

733
00:54:49,578 --> 00:54:51,829
Nothing, however, surpasses
the technique developed in my time.

734
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:53,873
- Crazy. Wild. Wild.
- Shut up, Slovnik.

735
00:54:53,958 --> 00:54:56,626
# Mama told me not to come #

736
00:54:57,795 --> 00:54:59,963
# Mama told me
not to come #

737
00:55:01,757 --> 00:55:05,468
# She said, That ain't the way
to have fun, no #

738
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:09,263
Boat six: Wickwire, McCool, Flea,
Cortez, Slovnik and O'Neil.

739
00:55:09,348 --> 00:55:11,641
Oh, come on.

740
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:14,936
Somebody got a problem
with my organizational skills?

741
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:17,021
Fine by me,
Master Chief.

742
00:55:17,106 --> 00:55:19,107
No problem here,
Master Chief

743
00:55:19,191 --> 00:55:20,942
# That ain't the way
to have fun, no #

744
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:24,988
# That ain't the way
to have fun ##

745
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:27,156
Stand by. Prepare to hit the surf.
Move!

746
00:55:27,241 --> 00:55:29,867
Boat four,
answer me this:

747
00:55:29,952 --> 00:55:35,373
When I see the sea once more,
will the sea have seen or not seen me?

748
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:38,167
This will be
a graded exercise.

749
00:55:38,252 --> 00:55:40,169
On my mark.
Stand by.

750
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:41,963
Mark!

751
00:55:57,396 --> 00:55:59,564
- Cortez, done.
- Time!

752
00:55:59,648 --> 00:56:01,607
Weapons on the table.

753
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:05,486
Is it hot out here,
or is it just me?

754
00:56:08,157 --> 00:56:10,033
- Kind of tender?
- It's okay.

755
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:12,410
Mmm. This?

756
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:15,413
- A little bit.
- Okay, you can get dressed.

757
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:18,916
Try to get as much air on those
abrasions on your back as you can.

758
00:56:19,001 --> 00:56:21,044
It's called amenorrhea
when you lose your period.

759
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:25,048
It's because you drop body fat, but
not at all unusual for female athletes.

760
00:56:25,132 --> 00:56:28,176
Okay, you got tendinitis
in your right knee...

761
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:32,180
and, uh, that is standard issue
jungle rot on your left foot.

762
00:56:32,264 --> 00:56:34,724
- Lovely.
- So, you're quite a mess.

763
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:37,351
Let's fix me up
and get me back out there.

764
00:56:49,323 --> 00:56:51,908
- Hey, Jordan!
- Whoa! Ladies!

765
00:56:51,992 --> 00:56:55,411
If I follow you home,
would you have premarital sex with me?

766
00:56:55,496 --> 00:56:58,915
Slovnik! You're barkin' up
the wrong dress. They ain't your type.

767
00:57:05,714 --> 00:57:07,423
Shit fire
and save matches.

768
00:57:12,721 --> 00:57:16,432
Goddamn three-ring circus
around here. Shit.

769
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:24,065
You trying to be bad?

770
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:27,235
You could be home curled up,
playin' with electrical toys!

771
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:31,072
Go on!

772
00:57:33,325 --> 00:57:36,327
Lieutenant,
why are you doing this?

773
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:39,789
- Do you ask the men the same question?
- As a matter of fact, I do.

774
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:43,292
- And what do they say?
- 'Cause I get to blow shit up.

775
00:57:45,504 --> 00:57:47,421
Well, there you go.

776
00:57:49,925 --> 00:57:52,760
On my mark. Stand by!

777
00:57:52,845 --> 00:57:54,804
Mark!

778
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:05,648
- O'Neil, done.
- Cortez, done.

779
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:07,817
Does it work, Lieutenant?

780
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:09,944
Well done, Lieutenant.

781
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:21,164
The Navy is still
declining to release the woman's name...

782
00:58:21,248 --> 00:58:24,542
but Senator DeHaven's office
is confirming that G.I. Jane...

783
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:28,796
has outlasted many of her male
counterparts in the elite Navy program...

784
00:58:28,881 --> 00:58:31,883
said to be one of
the most grueling anywhere.

785
00:58:31,967 --> 00:58:36,429
Joining us now on Washington Tonight,
for the feminist perspective–—

786
00:58:54,323 --> 00:58:57,200
Coxswain, hard a-port!

787
00:58:57,284 --> 00:59:00,703
- Line it up! Move it over!
- Come about!

788
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,873
Straighten 'er out!

789
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:08,085
- Line 'er up!
- Stay on your line! Get ready!

790
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:11,047
- Whoo!
- Come on! Move aft!

791
00:59:11,131 --> 00:59:14,675
Get up there!
Let's go, go, go!

792
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:19,722
Hoo-fucking-yah! It's like having sex
in a car crash! Whoo-hoo!

793
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:22,141
Okay, McCool, get up there.
Hoo-yah, baby!

794
00:59:23,936 --> 00:59:26,812
Come on, O'Neil.
Get on up here.

795
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:29,106
Let's go.
Use your arms! God!

796
00:59:29,191 --> 00:59:30,858
- Come on, O'Neil!
- Cut her loose!

797
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:32,485
Let her go!

798
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:39,033
Well, hoo-yah. About time
we dropped some dead weight.

799
00:59:41,662 --> 00:59:44,080
We don't leave
our people behind!

800
00:59:44,164 --> 00:59:48,376
What the hell you waitin' for?
Get with your crew! Get in there!

801
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:51,045
Let's go!
Let's go!

802
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:53,714
Come on, go!
You're swimmin' home!

803
00:59:56,343 --> 00:59:59,595
- Wanna pick 'em back up?
- Let's go home.

804
01:00:07,354 --> 01:00:09,772
Well, this is bullshit.

805
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:12,984
Now they're hammering me
just because she's in my boat crew.

806
01:00:13,068 --> 01:00:16,153
If you’d kept your mouth shut, we
wouldn't be out here in the first place.

807
01:00:17,656 --> 01:00:20,283
Had a grandfather
wanted to be a Navy man.

808
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:24,912
He wanted to fire them big guns
off them big-ass battleships.

809
01:00:24,997 --> 01:00:29,333
Navy says to him, "No. You can only do
one thing on a battleship, son.

810
01:00:29,418 --> 01:00:31,294
That's cook. "

811
01:00:31,378 --> 01:00:34,297
I'm not talkin' about
100 years ago, either.

812
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:37,800
I'm talkin' the United States Navy,
middle of World War Two.

813
01:00:37,884 --> 01:00:40,219
You know the reason
they gave him?

814
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:45,891
The reason why they told my grandfather
he couldn't fight for his country?

815
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:50,479
'Cause Negroes
can't see at night.

816
01:00:50,564 --> 01:00:52,523
Bad night vision.

817
01:00:53,734 --> 01:00:56,319
Damn, McCool.
That's unbelievable.

818
01:00:56,403 --> 01:00:58,529
Thank God
times have changed.

819
01:00:58,613 --> 01:01:00,573
Have they?

820
01:01:01,742 --> 01:01:03,659
So, you see, O'Neil...

821
01:01:03,744 --> 01:01:05,661
I know where
you're coming from.

822
01:01:05,746 --> 01:01:08,664
To them you’re just the new nigger
on the block, that's all.

823
01:01:08,749 --> 01:01:11,709
- You just moved in a little too early.
- Thanks, man.

824
01:01:27,768 --> 01:01:29,852
The Israelis
tried it.

825
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:31,854
Women in combat.

826
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:36,192
Seems the men couldn't get used
to the sight of women blown open.

827
01:01:36,276 --> 01:01:39,362
They'd linger over
the wounded females...

828
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:42,740
often trying to save those
who obviously couldn't be saved...

829
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:45,743
often to the detriment
of the mission.

830
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:48,746
You were given
the Navy Cross, right?

831
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:51,332
Can I ask
what you got it for?

832
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:55,878
Since it bears
on this conversation...

833
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:59,215
I got it for pulling a 240-pound man
out of a burning tank.

834
01:01:59,299 --> 01:02:02,218
So when a man tries to rescue
another man, he's a hero...

835
01:02:02,302 --> 01:02:06,680
but when he tries to rescue a woman,
he’s just gone soft.

836
01:02:07,808 --> 01:02:10,142
Could you have
pulled that man clear?

837
01:02:11,812 --> 01:02:16,065
You couldn't even haul your own
body weight out of the water today.

838
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:18,150
Permission to get dressed,
Master Chief.

839
01:02:23,031 --> 01:02:25,950
Mr. England went out
with a stress fracture.

840
01:02:26,034 --> 01:02:28,953
I'm moving Mr. Wickwire to boat five.
That puts you in charge of six.

841
01:02:29,037 --> 01:02:30,955
Why not McCool?
He's the same rank?

842
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:34,917
Because you were commissioned a month
earlier. Makes you senior officer.

843
01:02:36,503 --> 01:02:39,755
Remember,
there are no bad crews...

844
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:41,799
only bad leaders.

845
01:02:47,806 --> 01:02:49,890
In the more academically
oriented evolution...

846
01:02:49,975 --> 01:02:52,560
she's receiving
better marks than most.

847
01:02:52,644 --> 01:02:55,563
Plus, she's outlasted
40 percent of her peers.

848
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:58,607
- With dual standards.
- Actually, no, sir.

849
01:02:58,692 --> 01:03:02,653
She's been going head-to-head
with the men for some time now.

850
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:06,407
So she's lasted eight weeks.
That's wonderful.

851
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:08,409
Joan of Arc
meets Supergirl.

852
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:10,995
With S.E.R.E. training
coming up next week, sir.

853
01:03:11,079 --> 01:03:14,248
Commander, we'd like to see
more detail in your reports.

854
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:16,250
Let's include
more background information.

855
01:03:16,334 --> 01:03:20,629
Past training reps; medical history;
any grievances she previously filed.

856
01:03:20,714 --> 01:03:22,381
Understood?

857
01:03:23,425 --> 01:03:26,802
Um, actually,
not completely, sir.

858
01:03:26,887 --> 01:03:31,015
Am–— Am I being asked to provide
ammunition against this woman...

859
01:03:31,099 --> 01:03:34,351
in case the outcome isn't
what the Navy expects, sir?

860
01:03:34,436 --> 01:03:37,271
Absolutely not. We're simply
documenting as thoroughly as possible...

861
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:39,940
in the event this turns
into a legal matter.

862
01:03:40,025 --> 01:03:42,610
Don't read anything
Machiavellian into it, Commander.

863
01:03:42,694 --> 01:03:44,945
I'll try not to, sir.

864
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:46,947
Take your leave,
Commander.

865
01:03:47,032 --> 01:03:48,949
Thank you.

866
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:55,164
Loganville. Wilmington.
Coronado. Bedsford.

867
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:57,166
This is deeper
than we thought.

868
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:59,502
Look at Texas.

869
01:03:59,586 --> 01:04:01,837
I count four–—
no, five bases.

870
01:04:01,922 --> 01:04:04,840
We may not have to suffer
DeHaven much longer.

871
01:04:04,925 --> 01:04:08,344
She stands to lose 6,000 military,
4,000 civilian jobs...

872
01:04:08,428 --> 01:04:11,013
maybe 350 million
in lost revenue per annum.

873
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:13,015
Re-election's
six months off.

874
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:15,351
The D.O.D.'s put her
out of business.

875
01:04:21,233 --> 01:04:23,150
Yeah.

876
01:04:23,235 --> 01:04:27,696
People in Washington are scope-locked
on what's happening down there.

877
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:31,033
- Know how they're talking about you?
- I saw a newspaper.

878
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:34,203
That's the public side.
Privately, it's all being documented.

879
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:37,540
I mean everything, right down
to your breakfast and bra size.

880
01:04:37,624 --> 01:04:39,583
Why are you
telling me this?

881
01:04:40,752 --> 01:04:44,171
Big symbols
make big targets, Jordan.

882
01:04:45,632 --> 01:04:48,551
There's a lot of people
who don't want to see you finish.

883
01:04:48,635 --> 01:04:50,553
How about you, Royce?

884
01:04:50,637 --> 01:04:52,680
Do you want
to see me finish?

885
01:04:52,764 --> 01:04:55,683
Look, I'm just trying
to warn you. All right?

886
01:04:55,767 --> 01:04:58,561
Get you thinkin' about
where this might be headed in case–—

887
01:04:58,645 --> 01:05:01,230
Well, le t me just warn you.

888
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:03,732
I'm gonna go through with this...

889
01:05:03,817 --> 01:05:07,611
and the more everybody fucks with me,
the more I wanna gut it out.

890
01:05:07,696 --> 01:05:10,614
So don't you expect me back
anytime soon.

891
01:05:10,699 --> 01:05:13,617
Look, that is not
what I want, Jordan.

892
01:05:13,702 --> 01:05:15,619
I mean–—
Goddamn it.

893
01:05:15,704 --> 01:05:18,622
It is, but it isn't.
Do you understand?

894
01:05:18,707 --> 01:05:21,041
Still having a hard time
making decisions?

895
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:27,131
Jordan, just
watch your six, okay?

896
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:31,802
I gotta go, Royce.

897
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:33,804
Wait a se cond.
Don't–—

898
01:05:49,904 --> 01:05:53,449
Survival, e evasion,
resistance and escape.

899
01:05:53,533 --> 01:05:55,451
This is it, tadpoles.

900
01:05:55,535 --> 01:05:59,038
Your target t is inside
an area of five square miles.

901
01:05:59,122 --> 01:06:01,540
When and if
you locate this facility...

902
01:06:01,625 --> 01:06:04,710
you gather up as much intel as possible
within the allotted time frame...

903
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:06,712
and get the hell outta there.

904
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:10,966
You will be penalized for early
extraction, but even more for capture.

905
01:06:11,051 --> 01:06:12,968
Trust me.
Welcome to S.E.R.E.

906
01:06:15,889 --> 01:06:19,767
- Get ready! Stand up!
- Stand up! Aye!

907
01:06:19,851 --> 01:06:22,478
- Thirty seconds!
- Thirty seconds! Aye!

908
01:06:22,562 --> 01:06:25,773
First man up, go!

909
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:33,489
Go!

910
01:07:28,128 --> 01:07:30,087
So, where'd they drop us, L.T.?

911
01:07:30,171 --> 01:07:34,049
At the line of march, 2-1-0.

912
01:07:34,134 --> 01:07:38,053
And just for shits and giggles,
let's switch to five for tactical traffic.

913
01:07:38,138 --> 01:07:40,764
Maintain casual dialogue
on assigned channels.

914
01:07:40,849 --> 01:07:45,310
Slovnik, take us to 2-1-0.
Cortez, move out.

915
01:07:46,688 --> 01:07:48,522
Move out.

916
01:07:49,774 --> 01:07:51,692
Let's go.

917
01:08:07,709 --> 01:08:10,252
Four clicks, 2-2-6.

918
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:16,925
She doesn't have one fuckin' clue
where we're goin'.

919
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:19,386
Shut up.

920
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:28,896
Cortez, Slov, you take my left flank.

921
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:30,898
The rest of us, move back.

922
01:09:11,064 --> 01:09:13,982
Looks like
she's right on the money.

923
01:09:14,067 --> 01:09:17,653
I had a busted watch once,
and it was right twice a day.

924
01:09:30,083 --> 01:09:32,000
Cortez.

925
01:09:32,085 --> 01:09:34,461
Target ahead. Belay my last.

926
01:09:34,546 --> 01:09:36,922
New rally point, my location.

927
01:09:49,769 --> 01:09:52,521
McCool, Newberry, right side.

928
01:09:52,605 --> 01:09:55,774
Flea, you come with me.
Let's move out.

929
01:10:05,326 --> 01:10:08,537
Listen up, everybody.
We need film from all angles.

930
01:10:08,621 --> 01:10:11,748
Record weapons, vehicles.
Count bad guys, Get ranks, if visible.

931
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:15,335
Slov, Cortez, check antenna
for comms capability.

932
01:10:17,505 --> 01:10:20,173
- McCool?
- There's nothing there, O'Neil.

933
01:10:20,258 --> 01:10:22,593
There are no prisoners,
there are no guards.

934
01:10:22,677 --> 01:10:26,346
Maybe we found this place
a little too easy. There's nobody there.

935
01:10:26,431 --> 01:10:28,223
Cortez.

936
01:10:28,308 --> 01:10:31,351
- McCool. Ten o'clock.
- Cortez!

937
01:10:32,604 --> 01:10:35,022
What the hell
are you doing?

938
01:10:35,106 --> 01:10:38,108
This is Team Leader to Team Fuck-up.
Knock the grab-ass off.

939
01:10:38,192 --> 01:10:41,904
Get back to your positions.
You're compromising the unit.

940
01:10:41,988 --> 01:10:45,365
- That's an order. Do it now.
- What are these fuckin' clowns doing?

941
01:10:49,537 --> 01:10:51,705
No, Slov.

942
01:10:51,789 --> 01:10:54,416
It’s just a souvenir.

943
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:56,209
No, Slov, not–—

944
01:10:56,294 --> 01:10:58,295
What the hell–—

945
01:10:58,379 --> 01:11:01,590
Shouting]
- Let's go!

946
01:11:01,674 --> 01:11:05,928
Welcome to summer camp, boys and girls!

947
01:11:06,012 --> 01:11:08,805
Blessed is he who expected nothing...

948
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:12,100
for he shall not be disappointed!

949
01:11:12,185 --> 01:11:14,102
Rendezvous rally point.

950
01:11:14,187 --> 01:11:17,648
Come on!

951
01:11:17,732 --> 01:11:19,816
Let's go!

952
01:11:26,032 --> 01:11:28,825
- It snapped.
- Oh, shit.

953
01:11:28,910 --> 01:11:33,455
Move your hand, man. All right, don't
move. You're only gonna make it worse.

954
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:36,792
- Oh, Jesus.
- Aaaah!

955
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:44,675
Get up. Get up!

956
01:11:47,345 --> 01:11:50,889
Get off me!
I can't fucking breathe!

957
01:11:53,601 --> 01:11:56,228
Get him up.

958
01:11:57,897 --> 01:12:00,315
Aaaah!

959
01:12:04,278 --> 01:12:06,196
Flea.
Are you all right?

960
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:08,865
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
I'm all right. I'm all right.

961
01:12:12,704 --> 01:12:14,287
Get down!

962
01:12:14,372 --> 01:12:17,624
Who's in charge here?
Got any officers here?

963
01:12:17,709 --> 01:12:20,335
Got somethin' to say down here?

964
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:22,671
- You an officer. Huh?
- Fuck you. Fuck you.

965
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:26,425
You're too fuckin' ugly
to be an fuckin' officer.

966
01:12:28,136 --> 01:12:31,680
Who's the officer in charge? Huh?

967
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:33,849
You in charge here?

968
01:12:33,933 --> 01:12:37,185
I am! I am!

969
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:39,187
Boy, that was stupid.

970
01:12:42,608 --> 01:12:45,068
Oh, fuck. Oh, God.

971
01:12:45,153 --> 01:12:48,405
So you're in charge, huh?

972
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:52,826
Get him in the cage!

973
01:12:54,746 --> 01:12:57,497
Any other officers here?

974
01:12:57,582 --> 01:12:59,875
Get him in the cage. Move it!

975
01:13:05,965 --> 01:13:07,883
Third box.

976
01:13:15,141 --> 01:13:17,059
Wake up, sunshine.

977
01:13:17,143 --> 01:13:19,519
Shut up!

978
01:13:19,604 --> 01:13:22,022
Get up!

979
01:13:22,106 --> 01:13:25,567
- Don't let 'em break you, Flea.
- Take it easy, man!

980
01:13:31,574 --> 01:13:33,492
You know...

981
01:13:34,577 --> 01:13:37,245
I had an apartment
this size once.

982
01:13:40,708 --> 01:13:43,585
We're gonna be all right.
Right, Wick?

983
01:13:43,669 --> 01:13:46,088
We're gonna make it,
right?

984
01:13:46,172 --> 01:13:48,715
I don't know.
Last time I didn't.

985
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,675
What happened?

986
01:13:51,719 --> 01:13:54,096
I had a problem
with small spaces.

987
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:58,266
But as you can see, I've–—
I've worked that out.

988
01:13:58,351 --> 01:14:01,228
Are you hurt, or are you injured?

989
01:14:01,312 --> 01:14:03,605
Aaah!

990
01:14:05,691 --> 01:14:08,860
Don't let 'em use me against you,
no matter what. Okay?

991
01:14:10,321 --> 01:14:12,239
Okay.

992
01:14:12,323 --> 01:14:14,950
What the fuck is your problem?

993
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:18,954
Owww!
Aaaah!

994
01:14:19,038 --> 01:14:20,747
What's your problem?

995
01:14:20,832 --> 01:14:23,458
Are you hurt, Flea, or just injured?

996
01:14:23,543 --> 01:14:27,629
If you're injured, we'll get you off the
island and get you medical attention.

997
01:14:27,713 --> 01:14:30,590
'Course, you ain't ever
gonna see your crew again.

998
01:14:30,675 --> 01:14:34,427
- If you're simply hurt, we’re just gonna carry on.
- Which is it, Ensign?

999
01:14:37,515 --> 01:14:39,349
What's it gonna be?

1000
01:14:39,433 --> 01:14:43,603
Aaaah! Stop!
I'm hurt! I'm hurt!

1001
01:14:43,688 --> 01:14:46,690
That's a brave response.
What's it gonna be?

1002
01:14:49,193 --> 01:14:51,778
Let's try it again, Flea.

1003
01:14:51,863 --> 01:14:55,323
Are you hurt, or are you injured?

1004
01:14:55,408 --> 01:14:57,826
Aaaah!

1005
01:14:57,910 --> 01:15:01,371
- Give it up, man!
- What's it gonna be, Ensign?

1006
01:15:01,455 --> 01:15:04,374
Please. Please.

1007
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:06,543
Please don't fuckin'
do that anymore.

1008
01:15:06,627 --> 01:15:08,545
Where are they?

1009
01:15:08,629 --> 01:15:11,548
We'll just let you
back in your hole.

1010
01:15:11,632 --> 01:15:13,592
He's done.

1011
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:34,279
Aaaah!

1012
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:41,870
What is your father's name?

1013
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:45,874
It's a simple question, Lieutenant.

1014
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:48,877
No reason not to answer,
unless you wanna bleed.

1015
01:15:48,961 --> 01:15:50,879
What is your father's name?

1016
01:15:50,963 --> 01:15:52,714
Dad.

1017
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:59,179
How 'bout brothers or sisters?
You got any of them?

1018
01:16:00,681 --> 01:16:02,641
Dick, Jane and Spot.

1019
01:16:07,438 --> 01:16:09,856
You hungry, O'Neil?

1020
01:16:09,941 --> 01:16:13,610
What's your favorite food, honey?
Maybe we can get you something to eat.

1021
01:16:13,694 --> 01:16:16,112
Green eggs and ham.

1022
01:16:16,197 --> 01:16:18,323
"Green eggs and ham. "

1023
01:16:25,665 --> 01:16:28,583
Why didn't you carry out
your wounded, Lieutenant?

1024
01:16:28,668 --> 01:16:31,044
Was he too heavy...

1025
01:16:31,128 --> 01:16:33,588
or were you just plain chicken shit?

1026
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:37,050
You're not gettin' anything out of me.

1027
01:16:37,134 --> 01:16:40,679
You might as well just
put me back in the cage.

1028
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:48,561
You are in a cage.
Right here, right now.

1029
01:16:48,646 --> 01:16:51,815
I'm sorry.
Am I supposed to be afraid?

1030
01:16:51,899 --> 01:16:55,527
Right down to your worthless womb.
This is my island.

1031
01:17:03,035 --> 01:17:05,453
Jack.

1032
01:17:07,915 --> 01:17:11,001
What? You got a problem
with this, Max?

1033
01:17:13,212 --> 01:17:16,798
Then get the fuck outta here!
Get out!

1034
01:17:31,605 --> 01:17:35,942
He tell you what was comin' in there?

1035
01:17:36,027 --> 01:17:37,944
He didn't tell me shit.

1036
01:17:41,574 --> 01:17:44,993
You think we should go easy
on women, Lieutenant?

1037
01:17:45,077 --> 01:17:47,495
Do ya?

1038
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:51,207
- Fuck you.
- I'm so glad we agree.

1039
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:05,388
Two fire teams are still in the woods.
Who's gonna give me a fix on 'em?

1040
01:18:07,099 --> 01:18:10,518
Anyone can stop this.

1041
01:18:10,603 --> 01:18:14,898
Just give me one good piece of intel,
and it ends right here.

1042
01:18:23,824 --> 01:18:26,368
Ohhh! Ohh!

1043
01:18:32,792 --> 01:18:35,543
- Hang tough.
- Hang in there, O'Neil.

1044
01:18:35,628 --> 01:18:39,381
- You got something to tell me?
- Don't do it. Don't do it.

1045
01:18:39,465 --> 01:18:41,383
They're gonna kill you,
O'Neil!

1046
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:49,349
Ever think about what happens
when you're captured, Lieutenant?

1047
01:18:49,433 --> 01:18:52,060
Oh, yeah.
Just like the men do.

1048
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:59,567
We practice these things
so you know what to expect.

1049
01:18:59,652 --> 01:19:02,278
Should I practice bleeding too?
Would that make me a better soldier?

1050
01:19:02,363 --> 01:19:05,031
Couldn't hurt.
Not in your case.

1051
01:19:05,116 --> 01:19:07,534
This is bullshit.
It's a fuckin' game, O'Neil.

1052
01:19:07,618 --> 01:19:13,039
Mr. Newberry! You gonna be chivalrous,
put a stop to this abuse?

1053
01:19:13,124 --> 01:19:16,209
- O'Neil, tell him somethin' or I will!
- Don't you tell him shit!

1054
01:19:16,293 --> 01:19:18,461
Aaaah!

1055
01:19:27,638 --> 01:19:29,806
Get him!
Don't let him get up!

1056
01:19:39,650 --> 01:19:42,569
Come on, get up!
Get up! Get up!

1057
01:19:42,653 --> 01:19:46,906
- Get up, O'Neil!
- Keep on him! Hit him while he's dazed.

1058
01:19:46,991 --> 01:19:49,617
Oh, don't you look pretty.

1059
01:19:49,702 --> 01:19:52,704
Don't start somethin'
you can't finish.

1060
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:59,502
- Come on! Get up, O'Neil!
- Get back, O'Neil!

1061
01:19:59,587 --> 01:20:02,213
- Come on, Jordan.
- Get up. Come on.

1062
01:20:05,176 --> 01:20:07,969
- Lay low!
- Be tough!

1063
01:20:10,681 --> 01:20:13,892
No!

1064
01:20:15,436 --> 01:20:18,771
You're a real fuckin' hero, man.

1065
01:20:33,871 --> 01:20:37,499
Guys, I'm savin' her life...

1066
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:39,918
and yours.

1067
01:20:41,378 --> 01:20:45,006
Her presence
makes us all vulnerable.

1068
01:20:46,425 --> 01:20:49,344
I don't want you learning
that inconvenient fact...

1069
01:20:49,428 --> 01:20:51,054
under fire.

1070
01:20:52,097 --> 01:20:54,724
- Master Chief.
- Lieutenant!

1071
01:20:54,808 --> 01:20:57,185
Seek life elsewhere.

1072
01:20:57,269 --> 01:20:59,395
Suck my dick!

1073
01:21:07,947 --> 01:21:11,866
Hoo-yah!
Hoo-yah! Hoo-yah! Hoo-yah!

1074
01:21:11,951 --> 01:21:15,703
Hoo-yah! Hoo-yah! Hoo-yah!
Hoo-yah! Hoo-yah! Hoo-yah!

1075
01:21:15,788 --> 01:21:18,540
Hoo-yah! Hoo-yah!
Hoo-yah! Hoo-yah!

1076
01:21:23,796 --> 01:21:26,839
Suck my dick!

1077
01:21:26,924 --> 01:21:31,386
Suck my dick! Suck my dick!
Suck my dick!

1078
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:35,390
- Move out!
- Suck my dick! Suck my dick!

1079
01:21:43,023 --> 01:21:45,441
It was out of line in there.

1080
01:21:47,653 --> 01:21:50,238
It ain't gonna happen again.

1081
01:21:56,954 --> 01:21:59,205
Yeah, it will.

1082
01:21:59,290 --> 01:22:04,294
Maybe not with you
or with these guys or with me.

1083
01:22:04,378 --> 01:22:06,337
She's not the problem.

1084
01:22:07,506 --> 01:22:09,924
We are.

1085
01:22:10,009 --> 01:22:13,303
She just made it
through S.E.R.E. training.

1086
01:22:13,387 --> 01:22:15,555
- She actually made it.
- Goddamn, that girl is good.

1087
01:22:15,639 --> 01:22:17,557
Oh, by the way, Newsweek called.

1088
01:22:17,641 --> 01:22:21,269
- They want to do a cover story on you and G.I. Jane.
- Wonderful news, Peter.

1089
01:22:21,353 --> 01:22:26,149
Let's talk about this when I get back
to the office. Thank you, darling.

1090
01:22:26,233 --> 01:22:28,610
Newsweek.

1091
01:22:28,694 --> 01:22:33,072
Great. They can come take your picture
at the retirement home in Waco.

1092
01:22:33,157 --> 01:22:35,074
Five of our bases they wanna close.

1093
01:22:35,159 --> 01:22:39,579
D.O.D. tried this trick with Resnik in
California five years ago and it worked.

1094
01:22:39,663 --> 01:22:42,832
He was not re-elected.
You want that to happen in Texas?

1095
01:22:42,916 --> 01:22:45,835
Douglas, nothing's final
till you see it on CNN.

1096
01:22:45,919 --> 01:22:48,838
There's a reason
they gave you that hit list.

1097
01:22:48,922 --> 01:22:51,466
You think they want a horse trade?

1098
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:54,969
I think they're waitin' for your call.

1099
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:14,739
Hey.

1100
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:18,618
Hi, O'Neil. I would've paid money
to have been there.

1101
01:23:18,702 --> 01:23:21,579
- Oh, you heard, huh?
- I think it was on the evening news.

1102
01:23:21,664 --> 01:23:24,248
Geez. Just what
I need–— more P.R.

1103
01:23:24,333 --> 01:23:29,462
Listen, a few of us are
gonna go over to the beach.

1104
01:23:29,546 --> 01:23:31,923
It’s just a barbecue. No big deal.
You wanna come along?

1105
01:23:32,007 --> 01:23:35,385
Well, actually, my crew
has invited me out for a drink.

1106
01:23:35,469 --> 01:23:37,512
Ooh, progress.

1107
01:23:37,596 --> 01:23:41,599
Well, however slow, however painful,
I think they're coming around.

1108
01:23:41,684 --> 01:23:44,185
Give me a few minutes.
I'll give you a lift.

1109
01:23:44,269 --> 01:23:47,188
Okay. Cool.

1110
01:23:51,944 --> 01:23:55,571
I got the next game!

1111
01:23:57,116 --> 01:24:00,201
Another round!
I got this round.

1112
01:24:01,203 --> 01:24:03,162
- You saw Flea?
- Yeah.

1113
01:24:03,247 --> 01:24:05,540
- How's he doin'?
- Think his leg's gonna heal all right.

1114
01:24:05,624 --> 01:24:07,834
I don't know about
the rest of him.

1115
01:24:07,918 --> 01:24:09,836
He went out on medical.
They'll roll him back through.

1116
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:11,838
Yeah, well,
they may let him back...

1117
01:24:11,922 --> 01:24:14,340
but I don't know if
they'll let him finish.

1118
01:24:14,425 --> 01:24:17,009
If they want you out,
man, they'll find a way.

1119
01:24:17,094 --> 01:24:21,013
- I'm still here.
- Hoo-yah! Great job.

1120
01:24:21,098 --> 01:24:23,558
Oww!

1121
01:24:23,642 --> 01:24:25,893
Yeah?

1122
01:24:25,978 --> 01:24:29,355
You know, O'Neil,
I like you better when you drink.

1123
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:33,317
You know, Cortez,
I like you better when I drink.

1124
01:24:33,402 --> 01:24:35,820
Shots are up, fellas!

1125
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:38,531
- Hoo-yah, shots!
- Hoo-yah, shots!

1126
01:24:38,615 --> 01:24:42,076
Joe. Yeah. We need a couple more.

1127
01:24:42,161 --> 01:24:44,412
Here we go.
Everybody's got one?

1128
01:24:44,496 --> 01:24:46,414
All right, people.

1129
01:24:46,498 --> 01:24:48,750
We've been through a lot of shit.
Here's to the living.

1130
01:24:48,834 --> 01:24:51,377
- Who's got the toast?
- I've got one.

1131
01:24:51,462 --> 01:24:55,214
Um, you guys
re-remember this one?

1132
01:24:55,299 --> 01:24:57,592
Suck my dick!

1133
01:24:57,676 --> 01:25:01,012
Hoo-yah!

1134
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:03,181
Just keep it down, all right?

1135
01:25:03,265 --> 01:25:06,726
Hey, Jordan, I was,
uh, wondering...

1136
01:25:06,810 --> 01:25:08,728
if you, um–—

1137
01:25:08,812 --> 01:25:10,688
you're all right.

1138
01:25:10,773 --> 01:25:14,192
I gotta get out of here.

1139
01:25:18,614 --> 01:25:20,698
# In a world of fire #

1140
01:25:20,783 --> 01:25:22,450
# Really wouldn't want us
to fight for them #

1141
01:25:22,534 --> 01:25:24,744
# 'Cause they're
not even born #

1142
01:25:24,828 --> 01:25:28,122
# We can't even fight
for ourselves anymore #

1143
01:25:28,207 --> 01:25:29,624
# That's why #

1144
01:25:29,708 --> 01:25:33,461
Ain't really none of my business,
but I say leave the bastard.

1145
01:25:33,545 --> 01:25:39,342
# The future is a war#

1146
01:25:42,221 --> 01:25:43,930
# Out the window
went the perfect past #

1147
01:25:44,014 --> 01:25:45,973
# A participle, particle
An atom to smash #

1148
01:25:46,058 --> 01:25:49,811
# And smash and smash and smash
and smash and smash and smash again #

1149
01:25:49,895 --> 01:25:51,395
# Didn't we used to
know ourselves when #

1150
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:53,648
# Didn't we ever
used to be friends #

1151
01:25:53,732 --> 01:25:57,693
# Before a billion years
went down the drain and that's why #

1152
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:02,740
# The future is a war#

1153
01:26:03,826 --> 01:26:06,869
# The future is a war ##

1154
01:26:32,437 --> 01:26:35,523
Hey, there. Hi.

1155
01:26:35,607 --> 01:26:38,776
What happened? Where are the guys?

1156
01:26:38,861 --> 01:26:42,613
Well, you know.
I just wasn't into picking up chicks.

1157
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:30,870
Wait a second.

1158
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:42,256
On a real world op,
we always use back-ups.

1159
01:27:42,341 --> 01:27:44,550
Two is one,
one is none.

1160
01:27:44,635 --> 01:27:46,552
- Is that understood?
- Yeah!

1161
01:27:46,637 --> 01:27:50,056
O'Neil to C.O. office.

1162
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:54,352
O'Neil, the C.O. wants
you in his office.

1163
01:27:57,189 --> 01:27:59,357
- Hey.
- Lieutenant, they're waiting.

1164
01:27:59,441 --> 01:28:02,944
This is Admiral Gallow
and Lieutenant Burke...

1165
01:28:03,028 --> 01:28:06,447
from the Judge Advocate
General's office.

1166
01:28:06,531 --> 01:28:08,741
Have a seat, Lieutenant.

1167
01:28:08,825 --> 01:28:12,536
I don't know, uh, a delicate way
to say this, Lieutenant...

1168
01:28:12,621 --> 01:28:14,538
so I'm not going to try.

1169
01:28:14,623 --> 01:28:18,626
Claims have been made
that you have, uh...

1170
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:24,090
engaged in fraternization
of the same sex variety.

1171
01:28:24,174 --> 01:28:26,634
Specifically that you were...

1172
01:28:26,718 --> 01:28:30,805
"seen in public venues with another
female officer at a time and manner...

1173
01:28:30,889 --> 01:28:33,683
as to suggest conduct
unbecoming an officer. "

1174
01:28:35,477 --> 01:28:38,771
Sir, is someone suggesting
that I'm a lesbian?

1175
01:28:38,855 --> 01:28:41,732
We're not asking
if you are, Lieutenant...

1176
01:28:41,817 --> 01:28:43,901
and you're not required
to respond even if asked.

1177
01:28:43,986 --> 01:28:46,153
This is merely an informal inquiry.

1178
01:28:46,238 --> 01:28:48,739
Where did you get these?

1179
01:28:48,824 --> 01:28:51,742
The source of these photographs
is also a part of our investigation.

1180
01:28:53,078 --> 01:28:56,580
I see. They were
sent anonymously.

1181
01:28:56,665 --> 01:28:59,792
Sir, I'd like to tell you that
this is completely groundless...

1182
01:28:59,876 --> 01:29:03,796
and in no way did anything happen
with Lt. Blondell and myself.

1183
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:07,174
I find this just as distasteful
as you, Lieutenant.

1184
01:29:07,259 --> 01:29:09,510
You will be required...

1185
01:29:09,594 --> 01:29:13,180
to cooperate with JAG and N.I.S.

1186
01:29:13,265 --> 01:29:16,267
Naturally, you will be given a desk
pending the outcome.

1187
01:29:16,351 --> 01:29:18,436
A desk?
Oh, this is–—

1188
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:23,149
Captain, obviously someone is trying
to sabotage my training.

1189
01:29:23,233 --> 01:29:25,317
You may repeat your training...

1190
01:29:25,402 --> 01:29:27,653
at a future date, if cleared.

1191
01:29:27,738 --> 01:29:31,032
- I can't go through this shit again.
- Ratchet down, Lieutenant.

1192
01:29:32,617 --> 01:29:34,952
I would not choose
to repeat the training, sir...

1193
01:29:35,037 --> 01:29:37,329
nor do I care
to drive a desk...

1194
01:29:37,414 --> 01:29:40,249
pending the outcome of
this malicious allegation.

1195
01:29:40,333 --> 01:29:44,879
Now, I respectfully request you keep me
with my crew or you send me packing.

1196
01:29:44,963 --> 01:29:49,050
That sounded dangerously
like an ultimatum.

1197
01:29:49,134 --> 01:29:52,219
You take it as you will, sir.

1198
01:29:55,182 --> 01:29:58,893
Don't worry.
It's me they're after.

1199
01:30:24,211 --> 01:30:27,088
# I remember#

1200
01:30:27,172 --> 01:30:29,799
# Holding on #

1201
01:30:35,263 --> 01:30:41,143
# All them long
and lonely nights #

1202
01:30:41,228 --> 01:30:44,063
# I've put you through #

1203
01:30:49,194 --> 01:30:52,279
# Somewhere in there #

1204
01:30:52,364 --> 01:30:56,784
# I'm sure I made you cry #

1205
01:31:00,247 --> 01:31:04,625
# But I can't remember#

1206
01:31:04,709 --> 01:31:08,420
# If we said good-bye ##

1207
01:31:10,382 --> 01:31:12,925
Hey.

1208
01:31:13,009 --> 01:31:16,720
I couldn't get
the gas back on.

1209
01:31:23,895 --> 01:31:25,813
I guess you've heard.

1210
01:31:25,897 --> 01:31:27,815
Yeah.

1211
01:31:29,401 --> 01:31:31,360
More than I really wanted to.

1212
01:31:42,747 --> 01:31:47,585
There was a time
I wanted you to fail...

1213
01:31:47,669 --> 01:31:51,505
but it was only
so I could have you close...

1214
01:31:51,590 --> 01:31:53,841
and safe...

1215
01:31:53,925 --> 01:31:57,344
and all to myself.

1216
01:32:00,432 --> 01:32:03,350
But you'd be hell to live with.

1217
01:32:18,867 --> 01:32:22,244
I love you.

1218
01:32:37,135 --> 01:32:39,511
Okay. Here it is.

1219
01:32:44,643 --> 01:32:47,603
- Take a look at these.
- Switch ya.

1220
01:32:53,985 --> 01:32:58,697
Now, this was faxed
to the JAG office Tuesday.

1221
01:32:58,782 --> 01:33:01,200
Arrived on my desk
Wednesday morning.

1222
01:33:01,284 --> 01:33:05,079
What do you see?

1223
01:33:05,163 --> 01:33:07,122
You see this?

1224
01:33:12,754 --> 01:33:15,130
What do you see?

1225
01:33:16,466 --> 01:33:20,094
Take a look on the right.

1226
01:33:20,178 --> 01:33:22,388
- Shit.
- That's right.

1227
01:33:26,017 --> 01:33:28,352
How important is this
to you, Jordan?

1228
01:33:30,272 --> 01:33:34,066
I'm just asking.
I'm just asking.

1229
01:34:00,885 --> 01:34:04,138
- Bridgeport Naval Base.
- Wait. Look at this.

1230
01:34:04,222 --> 01:34:08,892
In Tennessee, the board recommends
closing Fort Meyers...

1231
01:34:08,977 --> 01:34:11,645
and the Brantwood
Air Force Supply Depot.

1232
01:34:11,730 --> 01:34:15,983
In Texas, the board is recommending
no closures of military bases.

1233
01:34:16,067 --> 01:34:19,320
Last week, five bases in Texas were
on the chopping block. This week, none.

1234
01:34:19,404 --> 01:34:22,406
What does that tell you?

1235
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:25,326
...in a manner equitable
to all states...

1236
01:34:25,410 --> 01:34:28,454
while burdening no one state
with economic hardship.

1237
01:34:28,538 --> 01:34:30,831
First and foremost...

1238
01:34:30,915 --> 01:34:33,792
this commission worked
for the good of the country.

1239
01:34:35,253 --> 01:34:39,089
Of course, we anticipate
some controversy...

1240
01:34:39,174 --> 01:34:41,258
over our recommendations.

1241
01:34:41,343 --> 01:34:44,345
But we remind everybody–—
Senators, Congressmen...

1242
01:34:44,429 --> 01:34:47,348
- Governors alike–—
- Uh, excuse me, Mr. Burnham.

1243
01:34:47,432 --> 01:34:50,517
Now might be a dandy time
for that recess.

1244
01:34:50,602 --> 01:34:53,312
Till noon, everyone.

1245
01:34:56,941 --> 01:34:59,401
Jordan, I heard what happened...

1246
01:34:59,486 --> 01:35:01,737
and I do so very much
want to talk with you...

1247
01:35:01,821 --> 01:35:03,781
but now is scarcely the time.

1248
01:35:03,865 --> 01:35:07,034
I commend you, Senator.
Those were very nice photos.

1249
01:35:09,204 --> 01:35:12,498
Yes, we did have someone
taking shots...

1250
01:35:12,582 --> 01:35:15,959
but for future
publicity purposes.

1251
01:35:16,044 --> 01:35:19,254
I see. So how did they end up
in the Navy's hands?

1252
01:35:19,339 --> 01:35:21,757
Well, you'll have to ask them that.

1253
01:35:22,842 --> 01:35:26,053
If I have to ask
anyone again, Senator...

1254
01:35:26,137 --> 01:35:28,055
I'll be asking on C-SPAN.

1255
01:35:29,933 --> 01:35:33,977
Jordan. Come on.

1256
01:35:34,062 --> 01:35:38,190
Here are the Senator's
case notes.

1257
01:35:38,274 --> 01:35:40,317
Let me have it, boys.
Come on. Quickly, quickly.

1258
01:35:40,402 --> 01:35:42,319
Close the door.

1259
01:35:53,706 --> 01:35:56,083
Jordan, nearly every working day
I'm forced to make decisions...

1260
01:35:56,167 --> 01:35:59,461
that would have Solomon himself
shittin' golf balls...

1261
01:35:59,546 --> 01:36:02,256
and half of those decisions
are about political survival.

1262
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:04,758
I don't resent that.

1263
01:36:04,843 --> 01:36:08,262
So if you’ve come here lookin' for me
to apologize for keeping alive...

1264
01:36:08,346 --> 01:36:11,682
you better pull up a chair,
'cause you're gonna be here for a while.

1265
01:36:13,184 --> 01:36:16,937
Tell me you didn't sell me out.

1266
01:36:17,021 --> 01:36:21,066
Tell me you didn't sink my whole career
to make you look good.

1267
01:36:21,151 --> 01:36:24,069
Those charges will be dismissed.

1268
01:36:24,154 --> 01:36:28,407
Your career will go forward,
albeit back here in Washington.

1269
01:36:28,491 --> 01:36:31,618
Oh, come on. Don't tell me
you wanted that kind of life.

1270
01:36:31,703 --> 01:36:34,246
Squat-pissing in some
third-world jungle...

1271
01:36:34,330 --> 01:36:36,623
with some guys
looking up your behind.

1272
01:36:36,708 --> 01:36:40,878
I wanted the choice.
That's how it's supposed to be.

1273
01:36:40,962 --> 01:36:44,590
The truth is, the choice isn't yours,
and it isn't mine.

1274
01:36:44,674 --> 01:36:46,592
American families
are just not prepared...

1275
01:36:46,676 --> 01:36:50,387
to have their daughters
and young mothers in harm's way.

1276
01:36:50,472 --> 01:36:53,307
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do.

1277
01:36:53,391 --> 01:36:55,642
Roper, Paris, Gallup, all the polls,
they all come back the same way.

1278
01:36:55,727 --> 01:36:57,644
What are you saying?

1279
01:36:58,980 --> 01:37:02,149
That a woman's life
is more valuable than a man's?

1280
01:37:02,233 --> 01:37:06,236
That a woman's death
is more hurtful than a man's?

1281
01:37:06,321 --> 01:37:10,741
No politician can afford to let women
come home in body bags...

1282
01:37:10,825 --> 01:37:12,743
especially me.

1283
01:37:17,707 --> 01:37:19,917
It was never gonna happen anyway.

1284
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:26,632
Then why the fuck did you start me
on all this in the first place?

1285
01:37:27,759 --> 01:37:30,093
Truthfully?

1286
01:37:30,178 --> 01:37:35,766
I never expected you to do so damn well.
I thought you'd ring out in two weeks.

1287
01:37:35,850 --> 01:37:39,269
Bing, bang, it's over,
and we're popular.

1288
01:37:42,732 --> 01:37:44,650
In Washington...

1289
01:37:44,734 --> 01:37:48,028
you don't even need the Ten Commandments
if you’re popular.

1290
01:37:53,117 --> 01:37:57,663
I wonder what Secretary Hayes
would think about this...

1291
01:37:57,747 --> 01:37:59,873
if he was to know
how you dealt me away...

1292
01:37:59,958 --> 01:38:03,669
for bases, for votes.

1293
01:38:03,753 --> 01:38:07,506
What makes you think
he doesn't know?

1294
01:38:12,136 --> 01:38:14,805
Don't even think about playing politics
with me, little darling.

1295
01:38:14,889 --> 01:38:16,807
You'll be up way past your bedtime.

1296
01:38:16,891 --> 01:38:20,352
And don't you think that
I will stand idly by...

1297
01:38:20,436 --> 01:38:24,064
while anyone smears
my good name.

1298
01:38:24,148 --> 01:38:29,152
Now, you get those charges voided,
Senator, and you do it today.

1299
01:38:29,237 --> 01:38:31,405
Or what?

1300
01:38:31,489 --> 01:38:34,366
You like pissed off?

1301
01:38:34,450 --> 01:38:36,952
Watch this.

1302
01:38:41,249 --> 01:38:43,417
Jordan, you're asking me
to unring a bell.

1303
01:38:43,501 --> 01:38:45,419
- I cannot do that.
- I'm not asking.

1304
01:38:45,503 --> 01:38:48,714
Think about what you do before you go in
front of cameras and embarrass yourself.

1305
01:38:48,798 --> 01:38:51,758
- You have no proof!
- Accusations seem to be enough.

1306
01:38:51,843 --> 01:38:55,095
- You taught me that.
- Jordan!

1307
01:38:55,179 --> 01:38:58,181
Hell of a game
of brinkmanship you play.

1308
01:38:58,266 --> 01:39:00,726
I'm not playing games, Senator.

1309
01:39:00,810 --> 01:39:02,936
I gather.

1310
01:39:09,110 --> 01:39:11,194
I'll do it.

1311
01:39:11,279 --> 01:39:15,324
Somehow, I'll get you back in.

1312
01:39:28,713 --> 01:39:30,631
Hey, guys.

1313
01:39:30,715 --> 01:39:33,884
Guys, come here. Take a look at this.
Look who's back in town.

1314
01:39:36,054 --> 01:39:38,305
Lieutenant. Come here.

1315
01:39:42,393 --> 01:39:46,313
I don't know what the hell's
been going on in the last 48 hours.

1316
01:39:46,397 --> 01:39:49,441
Frankly, I don't give a shit.

1317
01:39:49,525 --> 01:39:51,485
Good to see you too,
Master Chief.

1318
01:39:54,072 --> 01:39:56,323
Check out who's back, man.

1319
01:39:56,407 --> 01:39:59,993
- Mr. Wickwire!
- Yes, Master Chief?

1320
01:40:00,078 --> 01:40:02,829
Since the whole world
seems to be awake at 0500...

1321
01:40:02,914 --> 01:40:05,248
why don't you get your class
out here and into formation.

1322
01:40:05,333 --> 01:40:07,668
Might as well
crank it up right now.

1323
01:40:07,752 --> 01:40:10,462
All right, Master Chief
You guys heard him. Let's rock and roll.

1324
01:40:13,549 --> 01:40:17,552
- Ready for round two?
- Hoo-yah, Master Chief.

1325
01:40:35,863 --> 01:40:38,990
- Ready for me?
- You fuck!

1326
01:40:39,075 --> 01:40:42,744
Hey, Newberry, you ever done
one of these...

1327
01:40:42,829 --> 01:40:46,540
Operational Readiness
Exercises before?

1328
01:40:46,624 --> 01:40:49,292
No, Slovnik.
Never operated in the Med.

1329
01:40:49,377 --> 01:40:51,878
Well, it ain't exactly dangerous,
unless you're caught.

1330
01:40:51,963 --> 01:40:55,716
Even though the officials know
we're comin' to test security...

1331
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:58,218
homeboys guarding the power station
don't know shit.

1332
01:40:58,302 --> 01:41:01,221
Hey, McCool, remember that guy
that got caught...

1333
01:41:01,305 --> 01:41:03,223
settin' charges on the oil platform
years back?

1334
01:41:03,307 --> 01:41:05,892
I don't know, man. What?
Thomas? Taylor? I don't know.

1335
01:41:05,977 --> 01:41:09,813
Well, he tried to explain
it was just an exercise.

1336
01:41:09,897 --> 01:41:13,358
Well, he was talking English and
they was talkin' Arabic. So, you know.

1337
01:41:13,443 --> 01:41:15,861
- Did he die in prison or–-
- I don't know.

1338
01:41:15,945 --> 01:41:18,822
Well, I hope you assholes are
as ready as you think you are.

1339
01:41:18,906 --> 01:41:21,742
You girls are so full of shit.
No offense, O'Neil.

1340
01:41:21,826 --> 01:41:23,744
Jordan, what do you think
about that, huh?

1341
01:41:23,828 --> 01:41:26,163
Spending time
in some Arab prison.

1342
01:41:26,247 --> 01:41:29,875
After six months with you, Slovnik,
I might just fucking volunteer.

1343
01:41:29,959 --> 01:41:33,754
Now hear this. Now hear this.

1344
01:41:33,838 --> 01:41:37,466
This is the Captain speaking. We have been
directed to break from training exercises...

1345
01:41:37,550 --> 01:41:40,761
and join the battle group Tango Chaser.

1346
01:41:40,845 --> 01:41:43,388
We are proceeding
towards hostile waters.

1347
01:41:43,473 --> 01:41:47,100
Department heads make ready
for battle conditions.

1348
01:41:47,185 --> 01:41:49,102
That is all.

1349
01:41:49,187 --> 01:41:52,773
- Iran or Iraq?
- Libya.

1350
01:41:52,857 --> 01:41:55,609
At 0230, A D.O.D. satellite
dropped out of orbit.

1351
01:41:55,693 --> 01:41:57,736
Normally, that's not
a cause for such concern...

1352
01:41:57,820 --> 01:42:01,656
except this baby decided to drop
in Mr. Gadhafi's backyard.

1353
01:42:01,741 --> 01:42:05,660
What's more, I've got a range
of search units–— Task Unit Scorpion–—

1354
01:42:05,745 --> 01:42:08,580
already en route
to the strike zone.

1355
01:42:08,664 --> 01:42:13,293
My problem is that their exit plan
has gone to total shit.

1356
01:42:13,377 --> 01:42:16,254
Your C.R.T.'s are the closest unit
with the right capabilities.

1357
01:42:16,339 --> 01:42:19,132
Your job would be
to facilitate extraction.

1358
01:42:19,217 --> 01:42:22,177
Now, Master Chief,
if for one second...

1359
01:42:22,261 --> 01:42:25,847
you don't think they're ready for
whatever reason, you speak to me now.

1360
01:42:27,683 --> 01:42:30,602
- We'll be fine, sir.
- Excellent.

1361
01:42:32,855 --> 01:42:37,234
At present, we are three miles
off the Libyan coast... here.

1362
01:42:37,318 --> 01:42:40,487
Carrier support will remain
within striking distance.

1363
01:42:40,571 --> 01:42:42,489
Their call sign is Las Vegas.

1364
01:42:42,573 --> 01:42:46,326
Now, your unit is to make an
over-the-beach insertion here...

1365
01:42:46,410 --> 01:42:49,496
link up with the Ranger Recovery
Unit Scorpion...

1366
01:42:49,580 --> 01:42:52,499
and escort them out
without being detected.

1367
01:42:52,583 --> 01:42:56,002
Have the Rangers recovered
the device yet, Skipper?

1368
01:42:56,087 --> 01:42:58,171
Satellite power cells
have been located.

1369
01:42:58,256 --> 01:43:00,173
They're humping 'em out
now as we speak.

1370
01:43:00,258 --> 01:43:02,425
Scorpion Leader,
Scorpion Leader.

1371
01:43:02,510 --> 01:43:04,427
This is Las Vegas.

1372
01:43:04,512 --> 01:43:09,975
Be advised:
extract team under way.

1373
01:43:10,059 --> 01:43:14,020
Advise your E.T.A.
Over.

1374
01:43:14,105 --> 01:43:16,022
Copy, Las Vegas.
Copy, Las Vegas.

1375
01:43:16,107 --> 01:43:18,358
E.T. A approximately
one hour, 20 minutes.

1376
01:43:18,442 --> 01:43:21,987
- Over.
- Copy that, Scorpion Leader.

1377
01:43:22,071 --> 01:43:24,948
Be advised rendezvous
point of extraction team...

1378
01:43:25,032 --> 01:43:30,370
at the following coordinates:
3-2-1-5, 1-4-8-6.

1379
01:43:30,454 --> 01:43:32,372
I say again, 3–—

1380
01:43:32,456 --> 01:43:35,625
Are we talking the KH family here, sir?
The subhunter satellite?

1381
01:43:35,710 --> 01:43:37,794
Go ahead, Lieutenant. Fill us in.

1382
01:43:37,879 --> 01:43:42,382
The KH-12 Bravos
are nuclear-powered.

1383
01:43:42,466 --> 01:43:45,385
The onboard plutonium
is designed to survive re-entry.

1384
01:43:45,469 --> 01:43:48,179
Some kind of
protective shroud.

1385
01:43:48,264 --> 01:43:51,474
The plutonium
is, uh, weapons grade.

1386
01:43:51,559 --> 01:43:53,518
You know the drill,
Master Chief.

1387
01:43:53,603 --> 01:43:55,729
- Unfortunately, I do, Skipper.
- Carry on.

1388
01:44:02,904 --> 01:44:05,322
Who's not ready?

1389
01:44:13,664 --> 01:44:16,666
Inner door dogged.

1390
01:44:16,751 --> 01:44:19,669
Understand.
Inner door closed and dogged.

1391
01:44:22,298 --> 01:44:24,215
Mark and start.

1392
01:45:06,509 --> 01:45:08,426
- Clear. Clear.
- Clear.

1393
01:45:08,511 --> 01:45:10,428
Okay. Mr. McCool,
set up comms.

1394
01:45:13,557 --> 01:45:16,017
Lieutenant,
let's go find 'em.

1395
01:45:23,317 --> 01:45:25,652
Set up a perimeter.

1396
01:45:47,258 --> 01:45:49,175
Lieutenant.

1397
01:45:49,260 --> 01:45:51,636
9-0-1 's. Two o'clock.

1398
01:45:51,721 --> 01:45:54,014
Got it.

1399
01:46:02,440 --> 01:46:05,191
I still hold four.

1400
01:46:14,410 --> 01:46:16,953
Holy shit!

1401
01:46:20,791 --> 01:46:24,544
Border patrol.
A little ratty-assed, but still.

1402
01:46:24,628 --> 01:46:27,839
Yeah, parked right in the middle
of the extract corridor.

1403
01:46:27,923 --> 01:46:31,468
I got 25, maybe 30 with mixed weapons–—
AK's, SKS's...

1404
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:33,678
a couple RPG's.

1405
01:46:33,763 --> 01:46:36,389
Scorpion's gonna need
to be redirected.

1406
01:46:36,474 --> 01:46:38,892
Mr. Wickwire, come in.

1407
01:46:41,854 --> 01:46:44,314
Do you read me,
Mr. Wickwire?

1408
01:46:44,398 --> 01:46:47,484
- I can't raise the beach. You got 'em?
- Stand by.

1409
01:46:47,568 --> 01:46:50,278
Wick, you copy?
Wick.

1410
01:46:52,323 --> 01:46:55,700
Negative. I'll keep eyes on you.
Fall back, Radio Chaser.

1411
01:46:55,785 --> 01:46:58,995
No, Lieutenant.
I got the better eyeball. You go back.

1412
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:00,914
- Chief, I think that I–—
- Lieutenant, go.

1413
01:47:00,998 --> 01:47:03,541
Roger that.

1414
01:47:08,339 --> 01:47:11,883
Wait a minute. Take cover.
Take cover and freeze.

1415
01:47:14,345 --> 01:47:17,806
You got a vehicle coming towards you,
coming up the hill.

1416
01:47:21,018 --> 01:47:24,145
Stand fast.
He might blow right by ya.

1417
01:47:28,984 --> 01:47:31,778
Nope, we're not that lucky.

1418
01:47:31,862 --> 01:47:33,780
Stay down.

1419
01:47:45,626 --> 01:47:47,794
Lieutenant,
if this goes down...

1420
01:47:47,878 --> 01:47:51,589
make it silent.

1421
01:47:51,674 --> 01:47:55,635
Control your breathing.

1422
01:47:55,719 --> 01:47:58,471
Comin' at ya.

1423
01:48:00,224 --> 01:48:02,142
Twenty-five feet.

1424
01:48:02,226 --> 01:48:04,811
He's a big boy. You're gonna have
to take him from behind.

1425
01:48:04,895 --> 01:48:06,813
Twenty

1426
01:48:09,567 --> 01:48:11,693
Fifteen.
Movin' to your left.

1427
01:48:13,737 --> 01:48:17,448
Ten feet.
Right behind ya.

1428
01:48:29,503 --> 01:48:31,838
He's turned around.

1429
01:48:31,922 --> 01:48:34,424
- You want me to do it?
- Negative.

1430
01:48:34,508 --> 01:48:36,509
I'll do what I have to do,
but it's my call.

1431
01:48:36,594 --> 01:48:38,845
Here he comes.

1432
01:48:40,598 --> 01:48:43,016
Eight feet. Six.

1433
01:48:44,268 --> 01:48:46,811
- He's got ya. I'm taking him.
- No.

1434
01:48:47,855 --> 01:48:49,939
Fuck!

1435
01:48:50,024 --> 01:48:52,525
Clear out. Get back to the beach.

1436
01:48:52,610 --> 01:48:54,611
Go! Go!

1437
01:49:04,872 --> 01:49:08,291
That's the Chief.

1438
01:49:16,634 --> 01:49:20,553
Chaser, this is Chaser Alpha.
Do you read me?

1439
01:49:20,638 --> 01:49:23,223
- Comm to Chaser. Do you got 'em?
- Copy that, Chaser.

1440
01:49:23,307 --> 01:49:26,726
This is your lucky day, L.T.
Stand by, Chaser.

1441
01:49:26,810 --> 01:49:28,728
Hostile activity,
this location.

1442
01:49:28,812 --> 01:49:32,899
I say again, this location too hot.

1443
01:49:32,983 --> 01:49:35,860
Request you advise coordinates
for new extract.

1444
01:49:35,945 --> 01:49:39,072
- Over.
- O'Neil, slow down. Slow down.

1445
01:49:39,156 --> 01:49:41,115
Chaser Alpha,
loud and clear.

1446
01:49:41,200 --> 01:49:43,326
Will relay your traffic
to Las Vegas control. Over.

1447
01:49:43,410 --> 01:49:46,704
Also request gunship support
for extraction.

1448
01:49:46,789 --> 01:49:48,706
Location to follow.
Over.

1449
01:49:48,791 --> 01:49:51,584
Roger that, Chaser
Alpha. Will relay priority to Las Vegas.

1450
01:49:51,669 --> 01:49:54,671
Give me the coordinates when
you got 'em. We're outta here, guys.

1451
01:49:54,755 --> 01:49:56,756
We gotta get those boats out to sea.

1452
01:49:56,840 --> 01:49:59,842
If we don't get those boats back
to the extract site, wherever that is...

1453
01:49:59,927 --> 01:50:01,761
Scorpion's mission goes down.

1454
01:50:01,845 --> 01:50:04,597
Leave one boat with my team.
I'll wait for the Chief.

1455
01:50:17,152 --> 01:50:19,445
RPG's.
He's fucked.

1456
01:50:19,530 --> 01:50:21,864
Sounds like Chief's
running a little late.

1457
01:50:21,949 --> 01:50:25,118
We gotta go. O'Neil, retrace
your tracks. Cortez, pick up the rear.

1458
01:50:25,202 --> 01:50:27,912
- We're going back in there for body parts?
- You're damn right we are.

1459
01:50:27,997 --> 01:50:29,706
Do the headwork with me.

1460
01:50:29,790 --> 01:50:32,542
If he's on the run, he's not coming back
this way to lead them to us.

1461
01:50:32,626 --> 01:50:34,961
Right? Now look here.

1462
01:50:35,045 --> 01:50:38,589
If we’re here,
and I left the Chief here...

1463
01:50:38,674 --> 01:50:40,591
I think he's gonna
make his way southwest...

1464
01:50:40,676 --> 01:50:43,219
down this wash and out to sea.

1465
01:50:43,304 --> 01:50:46,389
If we hump it, we can get there
and knock out any pursuit.

1466
01:50:46,473 --> 01:50:48,766
You work this out with the Chief
ahead of time, O'Neil...

1467
01:50:48,851 --> 01:50:50,977
or are you just clairvoyant?

1468
01:50:51,061 --> 01:50:53,021
No, but it's what I'd do.

1469
01:50:54,648 --> 01:50:57,984
- I don't know. It sounds like a fucking crapshoot.
- Hash.

1470
01:50:59,653 --> 01:51:01,279
- What's up?
- Your team, take three boats.

1471
01:51:01,363 --> 01:51:05,450
- Wait for new extraction location from Las Vegas.
- Roger that.

1472
01:51:05,534 --> 01:51:08,328
The rest of us, we're gonna stay,
make sure the Chief gets out.

1473
01:51:26,930 --> 01:51:31,684
This is Las Vegas.
Message to follow.

1474
01:51:31,769 --> 01:51:36,647
New extract at 0-2-6-7-5-2.

1475
01:51:37,733 --> 01:51:42,779
I say again,
0-2-6-7-5-2.

1476
01:51:42,863 --> 01:51:45,114
- Over.
- Copy, Las Vegas.

1477
01:51:45,199 --> 01:51:50,661
But those boats will be there
this time, correct? Over.

1478
01:51:50,746 --> 01:51:53,664
That's a roger.
Sorry for the last.

1479
01:51:53,749 --> 01:51:56,376
It won't happen again.
This is Las Vegas, out.

1480
01:51:56,460 --> 01:51:58,419
Yeah, Scorpion, out.

1481
01:51:59,630 --> 01:52:02,256
Let's go.

1482
01:52:10,724 --> 01:52:13,393
Here?

1483
01:52:15,396 --> 01:52:18,898
I think it's perfect for a parallel
ambush. We can suck them right in.

1484
01:52:22,820 --> 01:52:24,779
Yeah. Let's do it.

1485
01:53:11,994 --> 01:53:13,911
Wickwire.
Come in, Wickwire.

1486
01:53:26,383 --> 01:53:28,301
What ya got, Cortez?

1487
01:53:28,385 --> 01:53:30,595
Nothin'.

1488
01:53:30,679 --> 01:53:33,764
O'Neil, it's Wick.

1489
01:53:33,849 --> 01:53:38,102
- Can you read my mind? What do you think?
- I don't see any other way.

1490
01:53:38,187 --> 01:53:41,814
There was foliage back to the south that
was good cover, but that's high ground.

1491
01:53:41,899 --> 01:53:44,484
I think he'd just be trapped.

1492
01:53:44,568 --> 01:53:48,404
I don't know, Wick. Shit.

1493
01:53:50,699 --> 01:53:54,035
Well, I see the Chief, and he's got
a boatload of trouble comin' our way.

1494
01:53:55,537 --> 01:53:58,331
Boys, let's get ready
to rock and roll.

1495
01:54:09,259 --> 01:54:11,636
Hold it, guys. Don't get trigger happy.
I got him at 30 yards.

1496
01:54:11,720 --> 01:54:14,096
Keep comin', baby.
Keep comin'.

1497
01:54:14,181 --> 01:54:16,307
Come on.

1498
01:54:16,391 --> 01:54:19,060
Twenty yards. Come on, Chief. We're
suckin' 'em–— We're suckin' 'em in.

1499
01:54:20,604 --> 01:54:24,440
Hold 'em up.
Hold 'em up.

1500
01:54:24,525 --> 01:54:28,110
- He's hit! He's down!
- He's hit! Gotta blow it now!

1501
01:54:28,195 --> 01:54:30,112
Negative, Slovnik.
He's in the kill zone.

1502
01:54:30,197 --> 01:54:34,033
Las Vegas, this is Chaser Alpha.
We have heavy, hostile–—

1503
01:54:37,955 --> 01:54:41,374
Repeat, immediate extraction.

1504
01:54:41,458 --> 01:54:44,460
He's hit again!

1505
01:54:45,546 --> 01:54:48,172
Fire, fire!
Fire, fire! Cover him!

1506
01:54:48,257 --> 01:54:52,009
Fire, fire, fire, fire,
fire, fire, fire, fire!

1507
01:54:52,094 --> 01:54:54,512
This is Chaser Alpha
to Las Vegas! Come in!

1508
01:54:56,640 --> 01:54:59,892
- McCool, I'm going in!
- Shit! Wick, give her some cover!

1509
01:55:08,485 --> 01:55:10,695
- Yah-hoo!
- She made it!

1510
01:55:14,116 --> 01:55:16,284
Come on, come on,
come on!

1511
01:55:21,081 --> 01:55:25,835
Got ya!

1512
01:55:29,673 --> 01:55:31,924
McCool!

1513
01:55:32,009 --> 01:55:34,719
Newberry, give me smoke!
Get him out of here!

1514
01:55:34,803 --> 01:55:37,555
- Let's go!
- Whoo-hoo!

1515
01:55:37,639 --> 01:55:40,850
Stay down!
Stay down!

1516
01:55:45,689 --> 01:55:49,442
That's it! Let's fall back!
Fall back! We're finished.

1517
01:55:54,865 --> 01:55:57,700
- Your guys?
- Sounds like the right area.

1518
01:56:25,979 --> 01:56:28,814
Christ!

1519
01:56:44,748 --> 01:56:48,000
- Over here! Move, move, move!
- Give me a hand!

1520
01:56:53,382 --> 01:56:57,468
Let's go! Let's go!
Take the airwaves! Stay down, Chief!

1521
01:56:59,221 --> 01:57:02,682
- Break it off!
- Come on! Get in there!

1522
01:57:04,267 --> 01:57:07,061
- Four heartbeat!
- Push it! Push it! Push it!

1523
01:57:07,145 --> 01:57:09,814
- Six heartbeat!
- I'm looking for an I.V.

1524
01:57:09,898 --> 01:57:11,857
I'm trying to find an I.V. here.

1525
01:57:11,942 --> 01:57:14,193
He's alive!
Give me some room!

1526
01:57:14,277 --> 01:57:16,696
- Slovnik, give me some room!
- All aboard!

1527
01:57:16,780 --> 01:57:19,115
All bodies in!
Let's get the hell out of Dodge!

1528
01:57:35,298 --> 01:57:38,884
- What a goat fuck.
- How's the Chief doin'?

1529
01:57:38,969 --> 01:57:41,929
He's all right.

1530
01:57:48,270 --> 01:57:51,772
Hey, O'Neil! I'd go to war
with you any day.

1531
01:57:57,571 --> 01:57:59,488
I'll never live this one down.

1532
01:57:59,573 --> 01:58:02,199
Tango-Niner, are you
boys en route with cargo? Over.

1533
01:58:02,284 --> 01:58:04,034
Sundown, this is Team Leader.

1534
01:58:04,119 --> 01:58:05,745
We have the cargo safely in hand...

1535
01:58:05,829 --> 01:58:07,830
and just tell whoever's listening
that we're coming home.

1536
01:58:07,914 --> 01:58:09,081
Tango-Niner out.

1537
01:58:25,140 --> 01:58:27,683
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you, Master Chief.

1538
01:58:31,938 --> 01:58:40,112
- Welcome aboard, sir.
- Thank you, Master Chief.

1539
01:58:43,867 --> 01:58:47,161
- Welcome aboard, Sergeant.
- Thank you, Master Chief.

1540
01:58:50,540 --> 01:58:52,833
Welcome aboard, sir.

1541
01:59:03,720 --> 01:59:05,638
Welcome aboard, ma'am.

1542
01:59:46,054 --> 01:59:49,348
# I remember#

1543
01:59:49,432 --> 01:59:53,477
# Holding on to you #

1544
01:59:58,608 --> 02:00:03,237
# All them long
and lonely nights #

1545
02:00:03,321 --> 02:00:06,198
# I've put you through #

1546
02:00:11,621 --> 02:00:14,373
# Somewhere in there #

1547
02:00:14,457 --> 02:00:19,003
Welcome to the SEALS
C.R.T. selection program.

1548
02:00:19,087 --> 02:00:24,967
You have volunteered for the most
intensive military training known to man.

1549
02:00:25,051 --> 02:00:27,386
Attention!

1550
02:00:27,470 --> 02:00:31,056
I now turn you over
to my Command Master Chief...

1551
02:00:31,141 --> 02:00:33,475
John James Urgayle.

1552
02:00:34,603 --> 02:00:39,273
# I recall all those nights #

1553
02:00:39,357 --> 02:00:44,403
I never saw
a wild thing sorry for itself

1554
02:00:44,487 --> 02:00:47,990
A bird will fall
frozen dead from a bough...

1555
02:00:49,993 --> 02:00:55,497
without ever having
felt sorry for itself.

1556
02:00:55,582 --> 02:00:57,666
Boat crews,
stand by your boats!

1557
02:00:57,751 --> 02:01:01,420
Move your asses!

1558
02:01:01,504 --> 02:01:05,549
# Was I just off somewhere #

1559
02:01:05,634 --> 02:01:08,719
#Just to hide #

1560
02:01:12,515 --> 02:01:17,227
# But I can't remember#

1561
02:01:17,312 --> 02:01:21,690
# If we said good-bye #

1562
02:01:54,474 --> 02:01:57,643
# I only miss you here #

1563
02:01:57,727 --> 02:02:01,230
# Every now and then #

1564
02:02:05,443 --> 02:02:10,906
# Like the soft breeze
blowing on #

1565
02:02:10,991 --> 02:02:14,493
# Through my curtains #

1566
02:02:19,082 --> 02:02:22,960
# Each November#

1567
02:02:23,044 --> 02:02:26,380
# I break down and cry #

1568
02:02:30,260 --> 02:02:35,139
# But I can't remember#

1569
02:02:35,223 --> 02:02:38,809
# If we said good-bye #

1570
02:02:43,940 --> 02:02:47,526
# I can't remember#

1571
02:02:47,610 --> 02:02:52,448
# If we said good-bye #

1572
02:02:52,532 --> 02:02:55,451
# Ohhh #

1573
02:02:55,535 --> 02:02:59,705
# I can't remember#

1574
02:02:59,789 --> 02:03:03,959
# If we said good-bye #

1575
02:03:08,256 --> 02:03:10,966
# Good-bye ##

1576
02:03:11,051 --> 02:03:16,221
# The future is a war#

1577
02:03:19,601 --> 02:03:21,351
# Out the window went
the perfect past #

1578
02:03:21,436 --> 02:03:23,062
# A participle, particle
An atom to smash #

1579
02:03:23,146 --> 02:03:27,274
# And smash and smash and smash
and smash and smash and smash again #

1580
02:03:27,358 --> 02:03:29,109
# Didn't we used to
know ourselves when #

1581
02:03:29,194 --> 02:03:30,903
# Didn't we ever
used to be friends #

1582
02:03:30,987 --> 02:03:34,823
# Before a billion years
went down the drain and that's why #

1583
02:03:38,036 --> 02:03:43,832
# The future is a war#

1584
02:03:46,544 --> 02:03:48,253
# Losin' already
Losin' everything #

1585
02:03:48,338 --> 02:03:50,422
# We got swastikas
hidden in magazines #

1586
02:03:50,507 --> 02:03:57,930
# Sewed in the label
of your slave-labor clothes #

1587
02:03:58,014 --> 02:03:59,932
# And that's why #

1588
02:04:02,894 --> 02:04:08,774
# The future is a war#

1589
02:04:11,528 --> 02:04:13,237
# Men prove worthy of our fears #

1590
02:04:13,321 --> 02:04:15,114
# Their strength diminishes
more every year#

1591
02:04:15,198 --> 02:04:17,199
# As they side with the enemy
and throw down their spears #

1592
02:04:17,283 --> 02:04:20,786
# Leaving women and children
alone right here to face #

1593
02:04:20,870 --> 02:04:22,996
# The future #

1594
02:04:23,081 --> 02:04:25,040
# That's why #

1595
02:04:28,044 --> 02:04:48,230
# The future is a war#
