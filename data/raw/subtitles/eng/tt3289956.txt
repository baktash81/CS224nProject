1
00:02:55,546 --> 00:02:57,696
<i>Sheriff, you gotta get down here.</i>

2
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,893
- We got an ID on her?
- No, sir.

3
00:03:31,973 --> 00:03:34,132
No relation to Paul and Carol.

4
00:03:38,122 --> 00:03:39,938
Who's she?

5
00:03:40,758 --> 00:03:43,308
Well, for now, she's a Jane Doe.

6
00:03:44,912 --> 00:03:47,603
- You got something?
- Nothing was stolen.

7
00:03:47,683 --> 00:03:49,942
Not a scratch on the outside
of the house either.

8
00:03:50,868 --> 00:03:52,768
Doesn't look like someone broke in.

9
00:03:52,948 --> 00:03:56,365
To me, it looks like
they were trying to break out.

10
00:06:03,201 --> 00:06:05,223
Cause of death?

11
00:06:05,303 --> 00:06:07,626
How about we skip this part tonight?

12
00:06:08,206 --> 00:06:11,356
Come on, this one's a soft ball.

13
00:06:13,244 --> 00:06:15,267
Smoke inhalation.

14
00:06:15,847 --> 00:06:19,338
You're telling me
that smoke killed Mr. Howard?

15
00:06:19,718 --> 00:06:23,992
Well, damaged nasal passage,
damaged throat, damaged lungs...

16
00:06:24,072 --> 00:06:27,946
Damaged lungs, yes.
But incompatible with life.

17
00:06:28,226 --> 00:06:33,111
- So, you're saying that's not the COD?
- I'm saying look before you leap.

18
00:06:35,016 --> 00:06:37,138
Where did the police find the body?

19
00:06:38,104 --> 00:06:40,795
- In his kitchen.
- House on fire.

20
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,628
Front door is 30 feet away,
yet, he's not trying to get there.

21
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,597
Lungs are damaged...

22
00:06:45,677 --> 00:06:48,894
...but airways not denuded nearly enough.

23
00:06:50,414 --> 00:06:53,899
So, he stopped breathing
before that fire really got going?

24
00:06:55,586 --> 00:06:57,502
Open him up.

25
00:07:00,591 --> 00:07:03,315
Now. Now you see here?

26
00:07:03,395 --> 00:07:06,645
- Down below the occipital.
- A fracture.

27
00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:11,477
- That explains the swelling in his brain.
- Subdural hematoma.

28
00:07:12,487 --> 00:07:15,297
That's what did it. Not the smoke.

29
00:07:17,008 --> 00:07:19,167
Everybody has a secret.

30
00:07:19,247 --> 00:07:21,860
Some just hide them better than others.

31
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,803
Some people are better at finding them.

32
00:07:24,883 --> 00:07:27,799
You did good. You'll get there.

33
00:07:31,121 --> 00:07:33,779
Nobody's even claimed him yet.

34
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:38,266
- He was all alone, that's why he died.
- He died because he fell and hit his head.

35
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:44,723
You got plans tonight?

36
00:07:44,803 --> 00:07:47,886
Emma wants to go see a movie at the Strand.

37
00:07:48,105 --> 00:07:50,308
I thought they'd closed that place down.

38
00:07:51,542 --> 00:07:54,870
No, when was the last time
you even went to go see a movie, Dad?

39
00:07:58,052 --> 00:08:03,716
She has Alzheimer's
and he's building her a house.

40
00:08:04,488 --> 00:08:05,544
The Notebook?

41
00:08:05,624 --> 00:08:09,831
Oh, yeah, your mother made me go
and see it with her for her birthday.

42
00:08:09,911 --> 00:08:12,160
I fell asleep five minutes in.

43
00:08:15,132 --> 00:08:16,655
Yeah.

44
00:08:16,935 --> 00:08:19,752
- Are you alright finishing up?
- Yeah.

45
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,547
What's up, Tilden?

46
00:08:25,627 --> 00:08:27,376
Hematoma.

47
00:09:48,893 --> 00:09:50,862
Stanley.

48
00:09:57,067 --> 00:09:58,777
Hey, Dad!

49
00:09:59,637 --> 00:10:02,110
Stanley got another one.

50
00:10:11,015 --> 00:10:12,564
Dad?

51
00:10:56,594 --> 00:10:58,311
Jesus Christ!

52
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:01,141
- It's so easy!
- How'd you get down here?

53
00:11:01,221 --> 00:11:04,289
- The key was in the elevator.
- Oh, my God.

54
00:11:05,069 --> 00:11:07,993
I gotta say, this is not
what I was expecting.

55
00:11:08,373 --> 00:11:10,962
You said it was old but wow.

56
00:11:11,042 --> 00:11:13,365
I thought we were supposed to meet out front.

57
00:11:13,445 --> 00:11:15,533
Well, I got tired of waiting.

58
00:11:15,613 --> 00:11:19,349
- Where are you going?
- I'm having a little look.

59
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:23,041
- Come back.
- God, the place just keeps going.

60
00:11:23,121 --> 00:11:25,877
Well, three generations
of Tildens keep expanding...

61
00:11:25,957 --> 00:11:28,513
...end up with this
state-of-the-art facility.

62
00:11:28,593 --> 00:11:30,682
Hey, come on.

63
00:11:31,062 --> 00:11:34,830
- What's the rush?
- I've been down here all day.

64
00:11:37,534 --> 00:11:40,525
You got to see me at my job,
why can't I see you at yours?

65
00:11:40,605 --> 00:11:42,854
You work at a book store.

66
00:11:56,086 --> 00:11:59,804
- Are these all people?
- Just three tonight.

67
00:12:01,225 --> 00:12:05,149
- Can I see one?
- Well, no. No. You cannot see one.

68
00:12:05,229 --> 00:12:08,020
- Why not?
- Because there's...

69
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,090
- ...some things you can't un-see, okay?
- Come on, I can handle it.

70
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:15,493
No. No. And my dad is way too strict.

71
00:12:15,573 --> 00:12:17,422
Try me.

72
00:12:18,942 --> 00:12:21,759
So, what'll it be?

73
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,303
Are you serious?

74
00:12:25,383 --> 00:12:28,306
- Are you?
- Hell yeah.

75
00:12:28,386 --> 00:12:29,965
Pick one.

76
00:12:48,706 --> 00:12:51,429
Not that one. The one next to it.

77
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:53,598
A body's a body.

78
00:12:53,678 --> 00:12:55,974
Yeah, well, I pick that one.

79
00:13:20,405 --> 00:13:23,308
- What's that for?
- To make sure he's dead.

80
00:13:23,742 --> 00:13:27,245
There used to be a time it was hard to tell
a comatose person from a dead one.

81
00:13:27,325 --> 00:13:30,585
So coroners tied bells
to everybody in the morgue.

82
00:13:30,665 --> 00:13:34,716
So if they heard a 'ting' they knew somebody
down there wasn't quite ready to go.

83
00:13:34,936 --> 00:13:38,167
- So, why do you have one?
- Well, I'm...

84
00:13:38,247 --> 00:13:40,365
...I'm a bit of a traditionalist.

85
00:13:44,428 --> 00:13:48,386
- Why did you cover his face?
- There wasn't much of a face left to cover.

86
00:13:48,466 --> 00:13:51,679
Point blank gun shot blast tend to do that.

87
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:52,847
Who shot him?

88
00:13:52,937 --> 00:13:55,660
Angle of entry suggests he did it to himself.

89
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,843
Until we found strychnine in his system.

90
00:13:58,923 --> 00:14:02,308
Judging by the progress it made through
his bloodstream he was already dead...

91
00:14:02,388 --> 00:14:05,216
...by the time somebody blew his face off.

92
00:14:05,296 --> 00:14:09,494
- Why would anyone do that?
- You sound like your boyfriend.

93
00:14:10,167 --> 00:14:15,260
Leave the "why" to the cops and the shrinks.
We're just here to find cause of death.

94
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:18,312
No more, no less.

95
00:14:27,851 --> 00:14:30,185
You don't wanna see that.

96
00:14:31,221 --> 00:14:33,562
It's alright.

97
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,068
Look who's easy now.
You should've seen the look on your face.

98
00:14:57,148 --> 00:15:00,623
I can't wait to see the look on your face
when you're not getting laid tonight.

99
00:15:00,703 --> 00:15:05,474
Hold on. Hold on. Not even if I ply you
with popcorn and sourpatch kids?

100
00:15:07,457 --> 00:15:09,674
You're lucky you're cute.

101
00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:13,060
How do you get used to that?

102
00:15:14,465 --> 00:15:16,681
You do and you don't.

103
00:15:19,536 --> 00:15:20,986
Sheriff?

104
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,430
- Where's your dad?
- What happened?

105
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,725
Bring her back here, Sheldon.

106
00:15:32,716 --> 00:15:35,173
- Dad, if you need me to stay...
- Oh, don't worry about it.

107
00:15:35,253 --> 00:15:37,501
You two go have your fun.

108
00:15:48,098 --> 00:15:50,422
Did you see the look on Burke's face?

109
00:15:51,002 --> 00:15:54,675
I mean, he wouldn't be here
this late if it wasn't important.

110
00:15:54,755 --> 00:15:56,250
- Here we go.
- Well, my dad...

111
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,596
- There it is.
- I can't ditch him.

112
00:15:58,676 --> 00:16:02,994
So you're ditching me again.
What's he gonna do when you leave?

113
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:09,307
- You haven't told him yet?
- No. It's not that simple.

114
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:13,745
Babe. I'm gonna tell him, okay?

115
00:16:13,825 --> 00:16:17,859
Hey, you think I wanna be here? Down there?

116
00:16:17,949 --> 00:16:22,714
This isn't my life. I don't wanna be
Austin Tilden, the morgue worker.

117
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:27,819
Just... he needs my help right now.

118
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:29,994
Come on, it's been two years.

119
00:16:30,074 --> 00:16:32,456
He can take care of himself.

120
00:16:34,978 --> 00:16:36,701
Come back in a few hours.

121
00:16:36,781 --> 00:16:40,405
We'll catch the midnight show,
grab a drink at Thornton's.

122
00:16:40,485 --> 00:16:42,073
Two drinks.

123
00:16:42,153 --> 00:16:45,903
11 o'clock, I'm all yours. I promise.

124
00:16:46,623 --> 00:16:50,408
And don't, you know, don't smile
because a smile means "yes," you know.

125
00:16:51,328 --> 00:16:54,679
I know it's in there.
Now, you're gonna blow your whole game.

126
00:16:59,202 --> 00:17:00,852
Maybe.

127
00:17:03,657 --> 00:17:05,153
You're hot!

128
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:22,947
Found her in the basement
of the Douglas' place.

129
00:17:23,327 --> 00:17:26,467
No ID, no fingerprints in the system.

130
00:17:26,697 --> 00:17:28,636
No one has a clue who she is.

131
00:17:28,716 --> 00:17:31,485
I don't suppose you know
how she wound up there?

132
00:17:32,036 --> 00:17:33,818
Stanley.

133
00:17:35,622 --> 00:17:38,439
Damn thing gets meaner by the day.

134
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:43,284
Alvarez there was working
at Paul and Carol's place.

135
00:17:43,364 --> 00:17:46,067
My best bet? He killed our Jane Doe.

136
00:17:46,147 --> 00:17:48,006
Needed a place to dump the body.

137
00:17:48,086 --> 00:17:51,609
Didn't count the Douglas'
being home or Paul having a .38.

138
00:17:51,689 --> 00:17:54,345
First thing tomorrow, I'll bring him in
but for now she's the priority.

139
00:17:54,425 --> 00:17:57,808
Still, it would have been nice
to take a look at the crime scene.

140
00:18:03,827 --> 00:18:07,558
I got four people dead and no
goddamn clue how any of it connects.

141
00:18:07,638 --> 00:18:10,728
Nobody's pissin' in your grits here, Shel.

142
00:18:10,808 --> 00:18:13,230
But we do have protocol.

143
00:18:13,777 --> 00:18:18,496
Press is gonna need answers on this
in the morning and I got nothing.

144
00:18:22,085 --> 00:18:26,911
Now they'll buy a 10-79.
I can give them A, B and E gone haywire.

145
00:18:26,991 --> 00:18:30,174
But what I can't sell is her.

146
00:18:32,829 --> 00:18:34,786
Time frame?

147
00:18:34,866 --> 00:18:38,077
- It's gotta be tonight.
- Okay.

148
00:18:41,088 --> 00:18:42,874
You didn't have to come back.

149
00:18:43,573 --> 00:18:45,175
I know.

150
00:19:04,461 --> 00:19:09,821
<i>This is the autopsy of an unidentified
female henceforth known as "Jane Doe."</i>

151
00:19:10,001 --> 00:19:13,524
Performing the autopsy will be myself,
Tommy Tilden, attending coroner.

152
00:19:13,604 --> 00:19:18,563
I will be assisted by Austin Tilden,
certified medical technician.

153
00:19:19,143 --> 00:19:22,500
This autopsy will be conducted
in four stages.

154
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,269
Beginning with an external evaluation...

155
00:19:25,349 --> 00:19:28,170
...followed by an internal evaluation
of the heart and lungs...

156
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:31,676
...the digestive organs
and finally, the brain.

157
00:19:31,756 --> 00:19:34,478
<i>We've got some beautiful weather here
for the next few days.</i>

158
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:37,633
Subject is in her mid to late 20s.

159
00:19:38,863 --> 00:19:40,685
Appears to be.

160
00:19:40,765 --> 00:19:44,422
Subject appears to be in her mid to late 20s.

161
00:19:44,702 --> 00:19:47,792
Caucasian. Skin appears normal.

162
00:19:47,872 --> 00:19:51,363
No outwards signs of bleeding or bruising.

163
00:19:51,943 --> 00:19:55,927
No scarring,
no distinctive external markings.

164
00:19:58,049 --> 00:20:00,537
Hair, brown.

165
00:20:00,917 --> 00:20:02,700
Eyes...

166
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,187
...grey?

167
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:16,497
You don't see clouding like that
unless a body's been dead for days.

168
00:20:20,536 --> 00:20:22,393
There's no lividity.

169
00:20:22,473 --> 00:20:25,703
No rigor mortis either.
When do you think she died?

170
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:28,266
Well, she's colder
than the ambient temperature.

171
00:20:28,346 --> 00:20:32,203
- What, conditions at the scene?
- Could be confounding factors.

172
00:20:32,283 --> 00:20:36,384
Look how small her waist is. Like it
doesn't really fit the rest of her frame.

173
00:20:36,464 --> 00:20:39,043
Could be congenital.
We won't know until we open her up.

174
00:20:39,123 --> 00:20:42,206
Mark it down on the board.
We'll come back to it later.

175
00:21:09,819 --> 00:21:12,303
Her wrists and ankles are fractured.

176
00:21:13,256 --> 00:21:15,680
How do you break your wrists and ankles...

177
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,388
...without any outward signs?

178
00:21:18,768 --> 00:21:22,159
- I see it all the time. Simple fractures.
- Simple?

179
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:24,548
Her joints are shattered.

180
00:21:28,171 --> 00:21:30,461
What is that? What is it? Dirt?

181
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:33,030
No, no, this is denser.

182
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,821
Heavier.

183
00:21:35,613 --> 00:21:38,235
It's... this is peat.

184
00:21:38,315 --> 00:21:40,422
Haven't seen this stuff in ages.

185
00:21:40,952 --> 00:21:42,807
It's under her toenails, too.

186
00:21:42,887 --> 00:21:46,804
Yeah. There are trace amounts in the hair.

187
00:21:47,357 --> 00:21:49,581
She's covered in it.

188
00:21:49,861 --> 00:21:52,276
Like, maybe she was buried in it?

189
00:21:53,263 --> 00:21:57,255
- Where do you even find peat?
- You buy it at a nursery.

190
00:21:57,335 --> 00:22:00,584
But naturally in the ground...

191
00:22:01,171 --> 00:22:04,389
...up north. Not around here.

192
00:22:08,478 --> 00:22:12,323
Nasal passages, no sign of inflammation.

193
00:22:12,403 --> 00:22:15,586
No fluid and no foreign substances...

194
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:18,286
...and ear canals are...

195
00:22:20,623 --> 00:22:22,339
...clear.

196
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:31,035
I hadn't expected that.

197
00:22:31,117 --> 00:22:34,025
- Tongue has been...
- Severed.

198
00:22:34,105 --> 00:22:36,227
Crudely. Non surgically.

199
00:22:36,307 --> 00:22:39,130
She could have bitten it off, you know,
she ODs on something, tensed up...

200
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:43,696
These aren't bite marks. See, striations.

201
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,344
I've seen something like this before...

202
00:22:53,424 --> 00:22:56,347
...about 15 years back.

203
00:22:56,427 --> 00:22:59,977
Human trafficking around Norfolk.

204
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:01,919
Two girls...

205
00:23:01,999 --> 00:23:04,689
...hands and feet...

206
00:23:04,769 --> 00:23:07,571
...bound tight...

207
00:23:07,651 --> 00:23:09,593
...to keep them from running.

208
00:23:09,673 --> 00:23:12,930
Cut out their tongues
for making too much noise...

209
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:15,900
You think this was some kind
of a prostitution thing?

210
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,323
Can't rule it out.

211
00:24:03,026 --> 00:24:07,208
Here, she has a molar missing
on the lower left side.

212
00:24:07,464 --> 00:24:09,680
Take some impressions.

213
00:24:31,921 --> 00:24:34,512
It's definitely some kind of fabric.

214
00:24:34,942 --> 00:24:36,807
Bag it.

215
00:24:37,112 --> 00:24:39,205
Send it to the lab.

216
00:24:59,984 --> 00:25:03,040
No external seminal fluid present.

217
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,643
Give me a swab.

218
00:25:35,017 --> 00:25:37,309
She's torn up inside.

219
00:25:38,189 --> 00:25:42,545
There are ridges, grooves in the tissue.

220
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:45,777
- Abrasions?
- No. Cuts.

221
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:48,746
Deliberate.

222
00:25:54,604 --> 00:25:59,063
Severed tongue, shattered joints,
vaginal trauma...

223
00:25:59,543 --> 00:26:01,665
The theory tracks.

224
00:26:01,945 --> 00:26:04,428
We're barely out of the external.

225
00:26:04,781 --> 00:26:06,964
We got a ways to go.

226
00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:19,803
<i>We'll now proceed
with the internal examination...</i>

227
00:26:19,883 --> 00:26:23,313
...starting with the heart and lungs.

228
00:26:23,393 --> 00:26:25,599
Help me with the block.

229
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:40,892
They're not supposed
to bleed like that. Right?

230
00:27:43,946 --> 00:27:45,970
I've seen it.

231
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:48,329
But only on a fresh corpse.

232
00:27:48,719 --> 00:27:53,142
An hour dead, maybe two.
It's caused by a build up of pressure.

233
00:28:09,389 --> 00:28:12,640
What is that? Melanoma maybe?

234
00:28:14,143 --> 00:28:16,200
On the inside?

235
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,001
Possible.

236
00:28:18,081 --> 00:28:20,564
Let's see what the lab comes back with.

237
00:28:30,726 --> 00:28:33,110
Can you hand me the rib cutters?

238
00:28:41,571 --> 00:28:42,934
Today?

239
00:28:58,755 --> 00:29:00,437
Shit.

240
00:29:04,494 --> 00:29:07,684
- What did you do?
- I got it.

241
00:29:07,764 --> 00:29:10,214
I need you to focus here.

242
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,633
I got it.

243
00:29:15,872 --> 00:29:17,523
Well...

244
00:29:17,918 --> 00:29:19,595
...you were right.

245
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:21,966
Her waist doesn't fit her frame.

246
00:29:22,046 --> 00:29:24,368
- It's not congenital.
- Then what is it?

247
00:29:24,448 --> 00:29:28,972
Well, if you wear one
long enough, a corset...

248
00:29:29,052 --> 00:29:32,331
Didn't those go out of style
a couple of hundred years ago?

249
00:29:54,977 --> 00:29:58,836
The lungs severely blackened.

250
00:29:59,416 --> 00:30:02,102
Wouldn't have taken her for a smoker.

251
00:30:02,252 --> 00:30:06,977
She could smoke ten packs
a day for 30 years...

252
00:30:07,057 --> 00:30:09,106
...wouldn't explain this.

253
00:30:10,793 --> 00:30:12,482
That's what killed her, right?

254
00:30:12,562 --> 00:30:15,485
No, this amount of lung damage, though...

255
00:30:15,565 --> 00:30:20,090
I'd expect the body to be covered
in third degree burns.

256
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:23,804
It's like finding a...
a bullet in the brain...

257
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:27,051
...but with no gunshot wound.

258
00:30:35,384 --> 00:30:37,541
Her heart's marked up.

259
00:30:37,721 --> 00:30:40,204
Almost like it's been cut.

260
00:30:43,292 --> 00:30:45,649
Well, not just her heart.

261
00:30:45,729 --> 00:30:48,752
What do you think that is? Genetic defect?

262
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:52,456
- Probably scar tissue.
- Scar tissue?

263
00:30:53,136 --> 00:30:55,162
From what?

264
00:30:56,939 --> 00:30:59,096
Imagine all this internal trauma...

265
00:30:59,176 --> 00:31:02,099
...was reflected externally.

266
00:31:02,179 --> 00:31:04,401
Shattered ankles and wrists...

267
00:31:04,481 --> 00:31:07,838
...fire-burned lungs, scarred organs.

268
00:31:07,918 --> 00:31:11,442
- What would she look like?
- She'd be mangled.

269
00:31:12,022 --> 00:31:14,475
Disfigured beyond recognition...

270
00:31:14,555 --> 00:31:16,324
...but she's not.

271
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:21,345
I mean, how the hell do you even do this?

272
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:32,796
If you wanna kill someone, you shoot them
or poison them or drown them.

273
00:31:32,876 --> 00:31:34,731
A million easy ways.

274
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:36,900
You don't go to these lengths...

275
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:41,038
...unless you wanna make them suffer.

276
00:31:47,924 --> 00:31:50,808
- What the...
- I'll get it.

277
00:32:22,842 --> 00:32:24,892
So clean.

278
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:09,586
What happened to you?

279
00:34:54,044 --> 00:34:56,099
What the hell happened?

280
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:59,530
- Are you okay?
- Something's in the vent.

281
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,069
Thanks.

282
00:35:11,994 --> 00:35:14,044
Oh, shit.

283
00:36:46,739 --> 00:36:48,722
Give me a minute.

284
00:37:37,606 --> 00:37:39,623
What are you doing?

285
00:37:40,442 --> 00:37:42,266
The drawer...

286
00:37:42,996 --> 00:37:45,312
...must have not closed it all the way.

287
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:56,426
Stanley was a pain in the ass.

288
00:37:56,726 --> 00:37:58,849
But he was your mother's.

289
00:37:58,929 --> 00:38:01,745
One of the few things of hers I had left.

290
00:38:03,265 --> 00:38:07,280
- Yeah, I miss her, too.
- Right. Let's keep going.

291
00:38:10,457 --> 00:38:14,874
This is stage three
of the autopsy of Jane Doe.

292
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,046
Beginning with the stomach
and the gastro-intestinal system.

293
00:38:24,036 --> 00:38:26,994
Dad, you can talk to me.

294
00:38:27,524 --> 00:38:29,947
I'm not keeping anything from you.

295
00:38:30,327 --> 00:38:34,744
You just... you put up this act for people...

296
00:38:35,431 --> 00:38:37,314
I'm fine.

297
00:38:40,169 --> 00:38:41,862
Alright.

298
00:38:53,882 --> 00:38:55,932
What is that?

299
00:38:56,986 --> 00:38:58,869
A flower?

300
00:39:17,006 --> 00:39:19,896
Jimson weed. Paralyzing agent.

301
00:39:20,276 --> 00:39:23,993
Probably explains
the inflammation on her organs.

302
00:39:26,046 --> 00:39:28,131
Here's a weird thing.

303
00:39:36,725 --> 00:39:39,948
That settles it. She's from up north.

304
00:39:40,028 --> 00:39:41,930
Yeah, but how did she end up here?

305
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:46,016
One thing at a time.
I'm just trying to make sense of all this.

306
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:53,596
<i>Gusts are now being reported
at up to 60 miles per hour.</i>

307
00:39:53,676 --> 00:39:56,566
<i>Rain is expected to top
three inches within the hour.</i>

308
00:39:56,646 --> 00:39:59,970
<i>This one might be a bigger deal
than we were led to believe.</i>

309
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:05,135
Dad, how about we just...
finish this in the morning?

310
00:40:06,141 --> 00:40:08,411
Burke needs a COD tonight.

311
00:40:08,791 --> 00:40:10,814
We're not even close.

312
00:40:11,794 --> 00:40:15,358
When we start something, we finish it.

313
00:40:16,098 --> 00:40:18,274
You wanna leave...

314
00:40:18,354 --> 00:40:19,983
...leave.

315
00:41:11,286 --> 00:41:14,877
It looks like some kind of shroud.

316
00:41:15,343 --> 00:41:17,214
And old.

317
00:41:17,594 --> 00:41:19,649
Stomach acids should have
dissolved this thing.

318
00:41:19,729 --> 00:41:24,080
I mean, the fact that it's intact
at all is amazing.

319
00:41:26,268 --> 00:41:28,558
Now see, what is that?

320
00:41:28,938 --> 00:41:30,687
Roman numerals?

321
00:41:49,958 --> 00:41:51,481
Okay.

322
00:41:51,561 --> 00:41:53,950
These numerals.

323
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:58,021
The order. T and... and this S.

324
00:41:58,101 --> 00:41:59,983
It doesn't fit.

325
00:42:02,754 --> 00:42:04,804
What are you doing?

326
00:42:24,092 --> 00:42:28,645
Someone pulled out her tooth, wrapped it
in fabric and forced her to swallow it.

327
00:42:29,765 --> 00:42:31,154
And the drawing?

328
00:42:31,234 --> 00:42:34,424
I don't know. Religious?
Possibly... ritualistic?

329
00:42:34,504 --> 00:42:36,780
Well, let's play that one out.

330
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,462
Every ritual has its purpose.

331
00:42:39,742 --> 00:42:42,165
What MO have we seen so far?

332
00:42:42,245 --> 00:42:44,634
First they bound her.

333
00:42:44,714 --> 00:42:46,543
Then they ripped out her tongue...

334
00:42:46,623 --> 00:42:49,282
...poisoned her, paralyzed her...

335
00:42:49,362 --> 00:42:51,507
...forced her to swallow the cloth.

336
00:42:51,587 --> 00:42:53,228
Then the cuts...

337
00:42:53,308 --> 00:42:57,498
...the internal mutilation, stabs.

338
00:42:58,047 --> 00:43:01,778
Then as if that wasn't enough,
they burned her.

339
00:43:06,336 --> 00:43:08,808
Almost like a human sacrifice.

340
00:43:09,972 --> 00:43:12,295
<i>I got to tell you,
we have serious weather reports</i>

341
00:43:12,375 --> 00:43:14,998
<i>coming in from all the monitoring
stations across the state.</i>

342
00:43:15,078 --> 00:43:19,462
<i>We've got a flash flood warning now in
full effect for all of Grantham County.</i>

343
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:23,667
<i>They've got concerns about...</i>

344
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,485
You can't kill someone this way
without leaving a trace on the outside.

345
00:43:28,925 --> 00:43:31,381
She doesn't even have a broken nail.

346
00:43:31,861 --> 00:43:34,417
If we could just find out
why she was tortured...

347
00:43:34,497 --> 00:43:39,062
Down here, if you can't see it,
touch it, it doesn't matter.

348
00:43:39,702 --> 00:43:43,593
Now, these bodies are not just CODs, Dad.

349
00:43:43,673 --> 00:43:45,928
This happened to her for a reason.

350
00:43:46,008 --> 00:43:50,727
<i>Trust me when I tell you, this is not
a storm you wanna get caught in, folks.</i>

351
00:43:55,384 --> 00:43:59,402
<i>One thing's for sure.
You're not going anywhere.</i>

352
00:44:13,503 --> 00:44:15,385
Hey, Dad?

353
00:44:18,341 --> 00:44:20,824
I think maybe we should get out of here.

354
00:44:39,362 --> 00:44:41,411
Help me with this.

355
00:45:03,085 --> 00:45:04,634
Holy shit.

356
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:42,805
What the fuck?

357
00:45:46,261 --> 00:45:48,618
Dad? Dad?

358
00:45:48,698 --> 00:45:50,413
Here!

359
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:07,697
Let's get the fuck out of here.

360
00:46:18,593 --> 00:46:21,144
Come on, come on.

361
00:46:29,771 --> 00:46:31,821
The generator.

362
00:46:37,699 --> 00:46:39,842
There's not enough power.

363
00:46:52,894 --> 00:46:54,880
It's stuck.

364
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,328
Help me with this. Help me with this!

365
00:47:03,071 --> 00:47:05,531
The old sycamore fell.

366
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:13,419
Fuck!

367
00:47:13,499 --> 00:47:16,179
The office. The landline.

368
00:47:48,984 --> 00:47:52,061
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know.

369
00:47:54,022 --> 00:47:56,038
Thank God.

370
00:47:58,093 --> 00:47:59,982
<i>Grantham County, Sheriff...</i>

371
00:48:00,062 --> 00:48:02,868
This is Tommy Tilden.
It's an emergency. We need help.

372
00:48:02,948 --> 00:48:06,215
- <i>Sorry, I've trouble hearing...</i>
- Put Burke on the line.

373
00:48:09,404 --> 00:48:10,526
<i>This is Burke.</i>

374
00:48:10,606 --> 00:48:13,930
Sheldon, this is Tommy.
You better get over here now.

375
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:16,999
<i>Hello? Tommy, I can't hear you.
You're breaking up.</i>

376
00:48:17,079 --> 00:48:20,269
Sheldon! Sheldon,
we're trapped down here, godda...

377
00:48:20,349 --> 00:48:22,931
- Sheldon, please...
- <i>Tommy.</i>

378
00:50:01,349 --> 00:50:03,666
What the fuck is going on?

379
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,969
It's her.

380
00:50:08,189 --> 00:50:11,013
Everything was fine until Burke
wheeled her through that door.

381
00:50:11,093 --> 00:50:13,883
- Son...
- Until we cut into her.

382
00:50:14,063 --> 00:50:16,579
You're talking about a corpse.

383
00:50:29,677 --> 00:50:32,101
These things we found inside her...

384
00:50:32,181 --> 00:50:35,404
...her injuries, those marks.

385
00:50:35,484 --> 00:50:37,850
You can't say she's just a body.

386
00:50:56,054 --> 00:50:58,178
We should have left.

387
00:50:59,408 --> 00:51:01,624
I wanted to leave.

388
00:51:10,118 --> 00:51:11,801
Dad!

389
00:51:19,361 --> 00:51:20,983
No!

390
00:51:21,063 --> 00:51:23,351
Dad! Dad!

391
00:51:33,608 --> 00:51:35,364
Dad?

392
00:51:35,471 --> 00:51:37,210
Shit.

393
00:51:49,325 --> 00:51:51,429
Oh, my God.

394
00:51:51,509 --> 00:51:53,431
Oh, my God.

395
00:51:53,511 --> 00:51:55,895
Careful, careful.

396
00:51:57,639 --> 00:51:59,322
God!

397
00:52:00,202 --> 00:52:02,784
- Help me up.
- Yeah.

398
00:52:05,473 --> 00:52:07,323
I'm fine.

399
00:52:08,910 --> 00:52:10,926
They were grey.

400
00:52:12,881 --> 00:52:14,697
Her eyes.

401
00:52:15,617 --> 00:52:17,800
It had her eyes.

402
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:20,894
That's what I've been trying to tell you.

403
00:52:21,607 --> 00:52:23,389
It's her.

404
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:25,581
Oh, no, that's not possible.

405
00:52:25,661 --> 00:52:30,680
No, her body those things we found
inside, those were impossible.

406
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:35,558
Whatever the hell happened in here...

407
00:52:36,438 --> 00:52:39,222
...we are way past possible.

408
00:52:40,808 --> 00:52:42,558
It's her.

409
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,698
So, what do we do?

410
00:54:03,224 --> 00:54:06,249
- Rapid decomp.
- Everything we took out of her.

411
00:54:09,297 --> 00:54:12,221
That's almost like her body
was preserving it.

412
00:54:12,601 --> 00:54:15,237
Must get her to the crematorium.

413
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,952
Fuck it.

414
00:55:57,668 --> 00:55:59,421
Jesus!

415
00:56:03,244 --> 00:56:05,424
Behind you, the extinguisher.

416
00:56:07,315 --> 00:56:09,638
The pin. Pull the pin.

417
00:56:36,093 --> 00:56:37,396
No.

418
00:56:47,788 --> 00:56:49,638
The elevator.

419
00:57:20,455 --> 00:57:22,304
Come on.

420
00:57:26,327 --> 00:57:28,130
No, no, no, no! Fuck!

421
00:58:05,432 --> 00:58:07,484
Come on.

422
00:58:07,564 --> 00:58:09,219
Come on.

423
00:58:10,205 --> 00:58:12,054
Come on!

424
00:58:41,068 --> 00:58:43,085
Go, Dad. Come on.

425
00:58:48,175 --> 00:58:49,991
Come on.

426
00:59:29,950 --> 00:59:32,541
Emma. Oh, no!

427
00:59:32,721 --> 00:59:34,710
Oh, no, no!

428
00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:36,716
Oh, my God!

429
00:59:38,292 --> 00:59:41,210
Oh, no! No!

430
00:59:43,197 --> 00:59:44,852
No!

431
00:59:44,932 --> 00:59:47,088
Oh, my God.

432
00:59:47,168 --> 00:59:49,184
No!

433
00:59:57,345 --> 01:00:01,697
- Oh, no, no, no!
- Austin...

434
01:00:15,963 --> 01:00:20,048
Austin, the elevator. Come on, now. Come on.

435
01:00:24,071 --> 01:00:25,888
Come on, son.

436
01:00:46,962 --> 01:00:48,710
Fuck!

437
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:53,382
Fuck!

438
01:01:08,516 --> 01:01:11,019
I told her to come back for me.

439
01:01:11,986 --> 01:01:14,203
I told her to come back.

440
01:01:15,189 --> 01:01:17,439
No, you didn't do this.

441
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:21,844
You shouldn't be here.

442
01:01:22,464 --> 01:01:25,898
All this is my fault.

443
01:01:26,168 --> 01:01:29,001
- You couldn't have known.
- Yeah.

444
01:01:29,671 --> 01:01:32,194
Yeah, that's what everyone told me...

445
01:01:32,274 --> 01:01:34,369
...about your mom.

446
01:01:39,447 --> 01:01:42,097
You know why I used to call her Ray?

447
01:01:44,452 --> 01:01:46,725
Ray of sunshine.

448
01:01:48,556 --> 01:01:51,072
She thought it was corny as shit.

449
01:01:51,593 --> 01:01:53,608
But it stuck.

450
01:01:56,997 --> 01:02:00,079
If I'd have known, I would've helped her.
You know that, don't you?

451
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:04,519
I mean, she was always so bright.

452
01:02:05,105 --> 01:02:06,955
So happy.

453
01:02:07,575 --> 01:02:10,465
To think she was carrying around all that...

454
01:02:10,545 --> 01:02:13,669
...pain, all that unhappiness every day.

455
01:02:14,299 --> 01:02:17,983
I should've seen it. But I didn't.

456
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:22,438
She had to deal with it alone.

457
01:02:25,643 --> 01:02:28,060
All these mistakes...

458
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:31,080
...my mistakes...

459
01:02:34,502 --> 01:02:36,719
...and you had to pay for them.

460
01:03:09,303 --> 01:03:11,610
Why hasn't she killed us yet?

461
01:03:11,690 --> 01:03:14,179
Well, it's not for want of trying.

462
01:03:14,759 --> 01:03:17,085
Well, look what she can do...

463
01:03:18,312 --> 01:03:20,562
...if she wanted us dead.

464
01:03:25,419 --> 01:03:27,709
When we cut into her...

465
01:03:27,989 --> 01:03:30,612
...she tried to stop us each time.

466
01:03:30,992 --> 01:03:34,777
It's like there's something
she doesn't want us to find.

467
01:03:49,116 --> 01:03:54,600
- You wanna go back in there?
- If we stay here, we're dead.

468
01:03:54,850 --> 01:03:57,733
If we could just figure out how she died...

469
01:03:59,570 --> 01:04:03,989
...maybe we can figure out how to stop her.

470
01:05:15,229 --> 01:05:17,459
- Dad?
- Right behind you.

471
01:05:18,899 --> 01:05:20,749
Keep moving.

472
01:05:27,319 --> 01:05:28,807
Austin?

473
01:05:33,048 --> 01:05:34,613
Dad?

474
01:05:35,649 --> 01:05:37,432
No!

475
01:05:40,587 --> 01:05:42,337
Dad?

476
01:05:58,589 --> 01:06:01,019
Dad. Dad.

477
01:06:01,209 --> 01:06:03,635
Come on. Come on.

478
01:06:25,232 --> 01:06:27,315
Come on.

479
01:06:35,275 --> 01:06:36,992
Okay.

480
01:07:04,037 --> 01:07:07,242
Brain... is normal.

481
01:07:07,875 --> 01:07:10,132
There's got to be something.

482
01:07:10,945 --> 01:07:13,695
All her other organs are scarred.

483
01:07:35,502 --> 01:07:38,184
- What the fuck?
- What is it?

484
01:07:57,674 --> 01:08:00,602
That's why we couldn't find cause of death.

485
01:08:04,798 --> 01:08:06,882
She's still alive.

486
01:08:07,901 --> 01:08:09,684
Alive?

487
01:08:10,404 --> 01:08:12,928
We lit her on fire.

488
01:08:13,508 --> 01:08:15,857
We took out her heart.

489
01:08:17,110 --> 01:08:21,069
There's something, some energy.

490
01:08:21,149 --> 01:08:24,316
Call it what you want,
something is keeping her going.

491
01:08:43,053 --> 01:08:45,037
What the...

492
01:08:51,678 --> 01:08:53,495
Leviticus.

493
01:08:57,884 --> 01:08:59,968
Let me see that.

494
01:09:03,123 --> 01:09:04,973
Leviticus.

495
01:09:06,209 --> 01:09:08,760
Twenty. Twenty seven.

496
01:09:17,204 --> 01:09:20,047
If these are Roman numerals then they'd be...

497
01:09:27,314 --> 01:09:29,531
...1693.

498
01:09:30,417 --> 01:09:34,342
"Any man or woman
who consults the spirits of the dead..."

499
01:09:34,422 --> 01:09:37,733
"...shall be put to death for they are..."

500
01:09:42,242 --> 01:09:43,516
Dad.

501
01:09:45,366 --> 01:09:47,355
Seventeenth century.

502
01:09:47,435 --> 01:09:49,451
North east.

503
01:09:51,972 --> 01:09:53,878
New England.

504
01:10:03,684 --> 01:10:05,560
"They are a witch..."

505
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:08,914
"...and their blood shall be
on their own heads."

506
01:10:17,664 --> 01:10:19,488
It fits.

507
01:10:20,318 --> 01:10:22,510
Witches are a myth.

508
01:10:24,004 --> 01:10:26,761
You can't keep denying.

509
01:10:26,841 --> 01:10:29,291
There were no witches in Salem.

510
01:10:29,876 --> 01:10:32,867
They were kids. Young girls.

511
01:10:32,947 --> 01:10:35,170
Falsely accused, wrapped up in hysteria...

512
01:10:35,250 --> 01:10:37,538
...one pointing to the next,
who pointed to the next...

513
01:10:37,618 --> 01:10:40,835
...but they were all, all innocent.

514
01:10:42,489 --> 01:10:44,182
Only...

515
01:10:44,562 --> 01:10:46,223
...they didn't hang her...

516
01:10:46,427 --> 01:10:48,676
...or burn her at the stake.

517
01:10:49,096 --> 01:10:51,213
They tortured her...

518
01:10:52,766 --> 01:10:56,325
- ...mercilessly.
- The ritual...

519
01:10:57,405 --> 01:10:59,420
didn't work.

520
01:11:13,119 --> 01:11:14,936
What if...

521
01:11:15,755 --> 01:11:20,038
What if the ritual,
performed on an innocent...

522
01:11:20,118 --> 01:11:22,610
...accidentally created...

523
01:11:22,690 --> 01:11:25,736
...the very thing we're trying to destroy?

524
01:11:27,634 --> 01:11:29,757
Everything they did to her.

525
01:11:29,837 --> 01:11:32,087
Everything we've done to her.

526
01:11:32,973 --> 01:11:34,973
She can feel it.

527
01:11:38,645 --> 01:11:41,386
She wants us...

528
01:11:41,959 --> 01:11:44,684
...to feel it too.

529
01:11:51,692 --> 01:11:54,109
That's why she's keeping us alive.

530
01:11:58,665 --> 01:12:00,349
This is her revenge.

531
01:12:03,153 --> 01:12:05,274
This is...

532
01:12:05,354 --> 01:12:06,766
...her ritual.

533
01:12:10,811 --> 01:12:12,700
But why us?

534
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:15,970
Why the Douglas'? Why anybody?

535
01:12:16,050 --> 01:12:19,968
We're on her path, that's all.
We were just stops along the way.

536
01:12:21,521 --> 01:12:24,178
Those who survived got rid of her...

537
01:12:24,258 --> 01:12:26,684
...and buried her as far away as possible.

538
01:12:26,993 --> 01:12:28,880
That hasn't stopped her.

539
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:32,947
Because no one got close enough.

540
01:12:33,733 --> 01:12:36,578
No one could see...

541
01:12:37,058 --> 01:12:39,080
...what we have seen.

542
01:12:45,946 --> 01:12:48,065
She's still suffering...

543
01:12:49,516 --> 01:12:51,733
...and it won't stop.

544
01:12:52,786 --> 01:12:54,872
It won't stop until...

545
01:12:55,222 --> 01:12:56,905
Until what?

546
01:13:00,327 --> 01:13:03,114
Dad, until what?

547
01:13:15,776 --> 01:13:17,865
I won't fight you.

548
01:13:17,945 --> 01:13:19,395
But please...

549
01:13:20,814 --> 01:13:23,775
...please don't hurt him.

550
01:13:24,518 --> 01:13:26,962
- Let me help you.
- Dad!

551
01:13:58,235 --> 01:13:59,951
Dad?

552
01:14:03,323 --> 01:14:04,546
No!

553
01:14:05,725 --> 01:14:07,071
Dad!

554
01:14:59,997 --> 01:15:01,566
Dad.

555
01:15:12,192 --> 01:15:13,905
No.

556
01:15:20,250 --> 01:15:22,033
Please.

557
01:15:23,603 --> 01:15:25,004
Please.

558
01:15:26,172 --> 01:15:27,889
Please.

559
01:16:46,486 --> 01:16:47,919
Tommy!

560
01:16:48,289 --> 01:16:50,645
Austin! Are you there?

561
01:16:50,725 --> 01:16:52,406
Burke?

562
01:16:56,896 --> 01:16:59,085
Anyone there?

563
01:16:59,165 --> 01:17:00,915
Burke.

564
01:17:02,201 --> 01:17:03,985
Austin!

565
01:17:07,874 --> 01:17:09,964
Austin! Are you down there?

566
01:17:10,044 --> 01:17:13,367
We're sawing down a tree blocking your door.

567
01:17:13,447 --> 01:17:15,963
We'll be with you right now, alright?

568
01:17:23,089 --> 01:17:25,379
- Austin!
- I'm here!

569
01:17:25,459 --> 01:17:27,381
Almost there.

570
01:17:27,461 --> 01:17:30,948
You'll be alright. Just open up the door now.

571
01:17:31,028 --> 01:17:32,920
- It's stuck.
- Try again, son.

572
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,282
I can't. It won't.

573
01:17:35,935 --> 01:17:37,478
Should open up now.

574
01:17:37,558 --> 01:17:40,059
- It won't.
- Should open up.

575
01:17:40,139 --> 01:17:42,668
- I'm trying. It's stuck.
- Open up.

576
01:17:43,678 --> 01:17:46,000
- I can't.
- Open up!

577
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:47,629
I can't.

578
01:17:47,709 --> 01:17:50,223
<i>Open up your heart</i>

579
01:17:50,303 --> 01:17:53,884
<i>And let the sunshine in</i>

580
01:17:54,264 --> 01:17:58,551
<i>So let the sunshine in</i>

581
01:17:58,631 --> 01:18:01,332
<i>Face it with a grin</i>

582
01:18:01,412 --> 01:18:04,472
<i>Smilers never lose</i>

583
01:18:04,552 --> 01:18:06,990
<i>Frowners never win</i>

584
01:18:07,070 --> 01:18:10,920
<i>So let the sunshine in</i>

585
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:17,525
No obvious signs of forced entry.
Looks an awful lot like he...

586
01:19:17,605 --> 01:19:19,921
I've known his family 20 years.

587
01:19:21,074 --> 01:19:23,357
Whatever it looks like, that ain't it.

588
01:19:25,862 --> 01:19:28,002
<i>Well, it's going to be
another nice one out there.</i>

589
01:19:28,082 --> 01:19:32,039
<i>Today's our fourth straight day
of sunshine. Looking at a high of 75.</i>

590
01:19:32,319 --> 01:19:35,803
<i>Beautiful outdoor weather,
but remember to use your sunscreen.</i>

591
01:19:40,376 --> 01:19:42,660
What the hell happened here?

592
01:19:50,303 --> 01:19:52,553
What do you want to do with her?

593
01:19:52,939 --> 01:19:54,210
Get her out of here.

594
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:57,498
Already got a car waiting.
There's that funeral home over in Ruxton.

595
01:19:57,578 --> 01:19:59,600
Get her out of my county.

596
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:02,002
Take her over to VCU.

597
01:20:02,082 --> 01:20:04,565
Let Ward Lamon deal with her.

598
01:20:52,398 --> 01:20:55,626
Now, baby, listen, that was one time.

599
01:20:56,336 --> 01:20:57,625
Hell, yes, that's a promise.

600
01:20:57,705 --> 01:21:01,557
<i>And you know what Hebrews chapter four
says "the word of God is powerful."</i>
