1
00:04:03,603 --> 00:04:04,764
Derek.

2
00:04:09,731 --> 00:04:10,679
Fucking pervert, Dan.

3
00:04:11,148 --> 00:04:12,689
What the fuck are you thinking?

4
00:04:13,149 --> 00:04:15,686
There's a black guy outside
breaking into your car.

5
00:04:16,151 --> 00:04:18,106
How long's he been there?

6
00:04:18,568 --> 00:04:19,433
I don't know.

7
00:04:19,902 --> 00:04:20,851
What's going on?

8
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,146
Not right now, honey. How many?

9
00:04:23,612 --> 00:04:24,561
Danny, how many?

10
00:04:25,029 --> 00:04:25,896
One, I think.

11
00:04:26,364 --> 00:04:27,941
Is he strapped?

12
00:04:28,406 --> 00:04:29,237
Does he have a gun?

13
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:31,489
I don't fucking know.

14
00:04:33,201 --> 00:04:35,276
Wait a second.
What the fuck is going on?

15
00:04:35,744 --> 00:04:37,534
Stay right here and be quiet.

16
00:04:37,994 --> 00:04:40,568
Wait a second, Derek. Wait.

17
00:04:45,623 --> 00:04:46,999
Stay right here.

18
00:06:28,633 --> 00:06:30,208
I don't have a personal problem
with him.

19
00:06:30,841 --> 00:06:32,501
Don't insult
my intelligence, Murray.

20
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,884
You hate this child,
and I think I know why.

21
00:06:41,723 --> 00:06:43,429
Dr. Sweeney's office.

22
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:45,715
I went out with his mother
a few times.

23
00:06:46,182 --> 00:06:47,972
That was three years ago.
It was nothing.

24
00:06:48,435 --> 00:06:49,429
Nothing. Really?

25
00:06:49,892 --> 00:06:52,726
That paper--
Bob, it's a travesty.

26
00:06:53,185 --> 00:06:55,854
Arguing for Hitler
as a civil rights hero.

27
00:06:56,313 --> 00:06:57,260
You've got to draw the line.

28
00:06:57,729 --> 00:06:59,851
Murray,you actually
did this to yourself.

29
00:07:00,314 --> 00:07:01,511
You told them to do a report...

30
00:07:01,982 --> 00:07:04,056
on any book that related to
the struggle for civil rights...

31
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:05,686
in plain English.

32
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:09,482
I am not disputing the fact
that the child is confused...

33
00:07:09,943 --> 00:07:11,437
and harbors some sick ideas...

34
00:07:11,903 --> 00:07:14,190
but I am not ready
to give up on him yet.

35
00:07:14,655 --> 00:07:17,109
His brother probably
put him up to it.

36
00:07:17,572 --> 00:07:19,363
I guarantee you 100% ...

37
00:07:19,823 --> 00:07:21,566
his brother did not
put him up to this.

38
00:07:22,034 --> 00:07:23,657
l find that hard to believe.

39
00:07:24,117 --> 00:07:25,362
I know he was a good kid...

40
00:07:25,826 --> 00:07:28,067
and it's a shame what he's been
through, but that's dangerous.

41
00:07:28,537 --> 00:07:29,995
Dangerous in what way?

42
00:07:30,454 --> 00:07:31,865
That goes too far.

43
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:35,697
This racist propaganda,
"Mein Kampf" psychobabble...

44
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:39,118
he learned this nonsense,
and he can unlearn it,too.

45
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:42,334
I will not give up
on this child yet.

46
00:07:59,801 --> 00:08:00,750
I knew it was you.

47
00:08:01,219 --> 00:08:02,878
Danny, get in here.

48
00:08:03,345 --> 00:08:05,087
I said get in here!

49
00:08:05,554 --> 00:08:06,502
Get in here!

50
00:08:06,972 --> 00:08:09,508
Five,four,three,two...

51
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:11,763
Shut the door!

52
00:08:14,725 --> 00:08:16,302
What's it gonna be, Danny?

53
00:08:17,435 --> 00:08:18,514
What's what gonna be?

54
00:08:18,978 --> 00:08:21,135
This petty crap you're pulling.

55
00:08:23,605 --> 00:08:24,386
I don't know.

56
00:08:24,856 --> 00:08:26,313
Have a seat.

57
00:08:32,234 --> 00:08:33,514
How are you doing?

58
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,396
Fine.

59
00:08:38,737 --> 00:08:40,362
Things at home OK?

60
00:08:45,532 --> 00:08:48,284
Derek got out this morning,
did he not?

61
00:08:50,493 --> 00:08:51,821
Yeah, he did.

62
00:08:52,285 --> 00:08:54,858
He was one of my students.
You knew that, right?

63
00:08:55,329 --> 00:08:56,739
Honours English.

64
00:08:57,204 --> 00:09:00,489
He was a brilliant student
like you...

65
00:09:00,956 --> 00:09:04,405
but he hung out
with simple-mindedfools...

66
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,072
also like you.

67
00:09:06,543 --> 00:09:08,250
Did you bring me in here
to talk about Derek?

68
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,951
What happened to him
has nothing to do with me.

69
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:15,084
Everything you do right now
has something to do with Derek.

70
00:09:15,547 --> 00:09:17,170
I followed directions.
I wrote an "A" Paper.

71
00:09:17,631 --> 00:09:20,251
"Mein Kampf"?

72
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,747
I should expel you.

73
00:09:23,217 --> 00:09:25,541
Go ahead. You don't
think I could handle it?

74
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:27,836
No. I think the street
would kill you.

75
00:09:28,303 --> 00:09:29,927
Your rhetoric
and your propaganda...

76
00:09:30,387 --> 00:09:32,462
aren't going to save you
out there.

77
00:09:33,764 --> 00:09:35,092
So here's the drill.

78
00:09:36,349 --> 00:09:38,007
I'm your history teacher
from now on.

79
00:09:38,475 --> 00:09:41,889
We will discuss current events.

80
00:09:42,352 --> 00:09:45,102
We will call this class...

81
00:09:45,561 --> 00:09:48,312
American History X.

82
00:09:48,772 --> 00:09:51,308
We meet once a day.

83
00:09:51,773 --> 00:09:53,729
All right.
Your first assignment...

84
00:09:54,191 --> 00:09:56,147
is to prepare for me
a new paper due tomorrow.

85
00:09:56,608 --> 00:10:00,391
Come on, Sweeney. It took me
a week to read "Mein Kampf."

86
00:10:10,448 --> 00:10:11,823
What do you want me to do it on?

87
00:10:12,282 --> 00:10:14,108
Your brother.

88
00:10:14,576 --> 00:10:16,318
Oh, God, man.
Please tell me you're joking.

89
00:10:16,785 --> 00:10:18,777
No. I'm not kidding.

90
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:22,328
I want you to analyse
and interpret all the events...

91
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,032
surrounding
Derek's incarceration.

92
00:10:24,496 --> 00:10:28,031
How these events helped shape
your present perspective...

93
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,166
concerning life
in contemporary America.

94
00:10:31,626 --> 00:10:35,373
The impact on your life,
your family's.

95
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:40,541
Whatever you want to say, Danny.

96
00:10:43,215 --> 00:10:46,214
I'll be the only one reading it.

97
00:10:47,467 --> 00:10:51,960
But if it's not on my desk
tomorrow morning...

98
00:10:52,427 --> 00:10:55,842
you are a ghost
at Venice Beach High.

99
00:10:57,346 --> 00:10:58,591
You clear?

100
00:10:59,472 --> 00:11:01,512
Yeah, I'm clear.

101
00:11:07,185 --> 00:11:08,134
Telling teacher
I'm fuckin' cheatin'!

102
00:11:08,602 --> 00:11:10,344
Is that what's happening?

103
00:11:11,354 --> 00:11:12,762
I never cheated in my life.

104
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,177
Beat his mo'fuckin' ass.

105
00:11:14,647 --> 00:11:15,512
I didn't say anything!

106
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,308
Why you trippin' on me?

107
00:11:19,691 --> 00:11:22,477
Now why you all kicking it
like that?

108
00:11:22,942 --> 00:11:24,351
What's up, man?

109
00:11:24,819 --> 00:11:27,687
What you scared for?
I ain't gonna do nothing.

110
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,448
What's up?

111
00:11:36,907 --> 00:11:40,073
Want some,too, bitch?
Punk,what's wrong with you?

112
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:41,993
You want to die?

113
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,446
Punk-ass white boy.

114
00:11:52,165 --> 00:11:55,662
You lucky I gotta go to class.
He ain't gonna do nothing.

115
00:11:56,126 --> 00:11:58,994
He don't wanna see me
and the heater.

116
00:12:00,711 --> 00:12:01,625
Lucky the bell rung.

117
00:12:02,087 --> 00:12:03,579
I would have clocked
that white boy.

118
00:12:04,045 --> 00:12:06,582
Punk-ass motherfucker.
Should smoke that fool.

119
00:12:07,881 --> 00:12:10,334
You gotta fucking stand up
for yourself.

120
00:12:25,973 --> 00:12:27,680
We got a whole file
on skinheads here.

121
00:12:28,141 --> 00:12:29,054
Part of the same gang?

122
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:30,298
Venice Beach gang.

123
00:12:30,766 --> 00:12:33,932
Actually,
he's done a stretch at Y.A.

124
00:12:34,394 --> 00:12:36,848
This guy C.C., is that him?

125
00:12:37,311 --> 00:12:39,267
Yeah,that's him right there.

126
00:12:40,813 --> 00:12:42,852
This morning we have a guest,
and there he is.

127
00:12:43,314 --> 00:12:44,096
Good morning.

128
00:12:44,565 --> 00:12:45,347
Morning, sir.

129
00:12:45,815 --> 00:12:46,765
Good to see you.

130
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:48,016
Good morning.

131
00:12:48,484 --> 00:12:49,894
This here is Dr. Bob Sweeney.

132
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,516
He's principal
over at Venice Beach High.

133
00:12:52,987 --> 00:12:54,894
For some time now,
he's been doing outreach work...

134
00:12:55,363 --> 00:12:57,436
with gangs
both in and out of the can.

135
00:12:57,906 --> 00:13:00,359
Three years ago, a local kid
named Derek Vinyard...

136
00:13:00,823 --> 00:13:02,530
was sent up for murdering
a couple of Crips...

137
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:04,864
who were trying to jack his car.

138
00:13:05,325 --> 00:13:08,444
Bob taught Vinyard, and
he's followed this case closely.

139
00:13:08,911 --> 00:13:10,866
He was a skinhead, right?

140
00:13:11,329 --> 00:13:13,367
He was more
like "the" skinhead...

141
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:15,573
the protégé
of Cameron Alexander.

142
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:18,160
-Who?
-Cameron Alexander.

143
00:13:18,624 --> 00:13:21,160
Here you go. Have a look-see.

144
00:13:21,626 --> 00:13:24,909
Cameron Alexander,well,
he's a Venice Beach landmark.

145
00:13:25,377 --> 00:13:26,918
He's the biggest distributor
and writer...

146
00:13:27,377 --> 00:13:29,334
of White Power literature
and videos in L.A. County.

147
00:13:29,795 --> 00:13:32,499
He promotes White Power bands,
he writes reviews...

148
00:13:32,964 --> 00:13:35,632
and in his spare time,this guy
even writes hate columns.

149
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:38,378
-Does he have a record?
-He's pretty clean.

150
00:13:38,842 --> 00:13:40,964
Been trying to pin something
to him, but it doesn't work.

151
00:13:41,427 --> 00:13:43,832
Trust me.
He's behind all of it.

152
00:13:44,303 --> 00:13:46,544
He runs everything
out of his house by the beach.

153
00:13:47,012 --> 00:13:49,135
There were no white gangs
in Venice Beach...

154
00:13:49,597 --> 00:13:51,553
before Cameron Alexander
and Derek Vinyard hooked up.

155
00:13:52,015 --> 00:13:54,470
Alexander found in Derek
his shining prince.

156
00:13:54,933 --> 00:13:57,338
Essentially,
he used Derek to recruit...

157
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:01,391
a slew of insecure,frustrated,
and impressionable kids.

158
00:14:01,853 --> 00:14:04,603
This kid Vinyard,
he's got a lot of baggage...

159
00:14:05,063 --> 00:14:08,975
as you'll see on this tape
we've gotten courtesy of NBC.

160
00:14:15,485 --> 00:14:17,725
Earlier today, L.A. County
fire-fighter Dennis Vinyard...

161
00:14:18,194 --> 00:14:20,316
was shot and killed
battling a blaze...

162
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:22,237
at a suspected Compton drug den.

163
00:14:22,697 --> 00:14:24,071
We're at the Vinyard home now...

164
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:26,024
and Lieutenant Vinyard's
oldest son Derek...

165
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,198
has agreed to talk with us
for a moment.

166
00:14:28,658 --> 00:14:31,657
Derek, if you could come
down here please for a second.

167
00:14:32,117 --> 00:14:36,742
Look, I know this is tough,
but how do you  feel right now?

168
00:14:37,203 --> 00:14:39,111
How do you think l feel?

169
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,116
-I think it's typical.
-Typical how?

170
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:45,866
Well,this country's becoming
a haven for criminals...

171
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,246
so what do you expect?

172
00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:49,534
Decent hard-working Americans
like my dad...

173
00:14:50,001 --> 00:14:52,539
are getting rubbed out
by social parasites.

174
00:14:53,003 --> 00:14:53,784
Parasites?

175
00:14:54,254 --> 00:14:58,119
Blacks, browns,yellow,
whatever.

176
00:14:58,588 --> 00:14:59,786
I don't understand.

177
00:15:00,256 --> 00:15:01,881
You think maybe your father's
murder was race-related?

178
00:15:02,341 --> 00:15:03,882
Yeah, it's race-related.

179
00:15:04,342 --> 00:15:05,800
Every problem in this country
is race-related.

180
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:09,543
Not just crime.
It's immigration,AIDS,welfare.

181
00:15:10,011 --> 00:15:11,837
Those are problems
of the black community...

182
00:15:12,304 --> 00:15:13,584
the Hispanic community,
the Asian community.

183
00:15:14,055 --> 00:15:14,968
They're not white problems.

184
00:15:15,431 --> 00:15:17,469
Aren't those really issues
that deal more with poverty?

185
00:15:17,932 --> 00:15:21,299
No. They're not products
of their environments.

186
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:23,177
Minorities don't give two shits
about this country.

187
00:15:23,642 --> 00:15:26,513
They come here to exploit it,
not to embrace it.

188
00:15:26,978 --> 00:15:29,218
Millions of white Europeans
came here and flourished...

189
00:15:29,687 --> 00:15:30,682
within a generation.

190
00:15:31,147 --> 00:15:32,973
What the fuck is the matter
with these people?

191
00:15:33,439 --> 00:15:35,099
They have to go around
shooting at firemen.

192
00:15:35,566 --> 00:15:38,138
What does this have to do
with the murder of your father?

193
00:15:38,608 --> 00:15:40,683
Because my father was murdered
doing his job!

194
00:15:41,152 --> 00:15:42,977
Putting out a fire in a fucking
nigger neighborhood...

195
00:15:43,444 --> 00:15:44,724
he shouldn't
have given a shit about.

196
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:47,068
He got shot
by a fucking drug dealer...

197
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,651
who probably still collects
a welfare check.

198
00:15:50,114 --> 00:15:52,604
Derek Vinyard was quietly
released from Chino...

199
00:15:53,074 --> 00:15:55,778
early this morning after serving
three and some odd years.

200
00:15:56,242 --> 00:15:58,732
I think this is something
we gotta keep an eye on.

201
00:15:59,202 --> 00:16:00,280
If something happens to him...

202
00:16:00,745 --> 00:16:03,412
things could get very ugly
down by the beach.

203
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,150
Just keep it low.

204
00:16:06,372 --> 00:16:09,122
Venice Beach
didn't always look like this.

205
00:16:09,582 --> 00:16:11,869
It used to be
a great neighborhood.

206
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:13,874
The boardwalk's always
been a dump...

207
00:16:14,334 --> 00:16:15,911
but when my dad moved us
out here...

208
00:16:16,377 --> 00:16:18,831
Venice was a nice,
quiet place to grow up.

209
00:16:20,338 --> 00:16:23,040
Over the years,though,
it's just gone to hell.

210
00:16:23,504 --> 00:16:25,047
The gangs are like a plague.

211
00:16:25,506 --> 00:16:28,422
They moved west from Inglewood
and South Central...

212
00:16:28,883 --> 00:16:29,712
and basically took over.

213
00:16:30,174 --> 00:16:31,550
I ain't foulin' you!

214
00:16:38,845 --> 00:16:40,719
I ain't got time
for all this bullshit.

215
00:16:41,181 --> 00:16:42,260
Fuck y'all.

216
00:16:42,723 --> 00:16:43,469
You all right?

217
00:16:43,931 --> 00:16:45,094
I'm all right.

218
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:49,427
Yo, is that that fool
you was telling me about?

219
00:16:50,644 --> 00:16:52,470
Yeah,that's that motherfucker.

220
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,221
Yeah, man,that's him.

221
00:17:09,402 --> 00:17:10,813
Bitch-ass motherfucker.

222
00:17:11,278 --> 00:17:13,021
That's why Derek started
the D.O.C.

223
00:17:13,488 --> 00:17:16,191
He said white kids shouldn't
have to walk around scared...

224
00:17:16,655 --> 00:17:18,813
in their own neighborhood,
and for a while there...

225
00:17:19,283 --> 00:17:21,653
we really made it
like it was ours again.

226
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:24,364
Throw the ball!

227
00:17:24,701 --> 00:17:25,781
Come on, Curtis!

228
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:28,118
Quit chucking it up.
Pass the ball.

229
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,579
"D" up!

230
00:17:32,038 --> 00:17:33,236
Come on, let's go.

231
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:35,570
Look at this
fucking jungle bunny.

232
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:38,708
He does a spin move every time.

233
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:42,201
You ain't gettin' shit,
motherfucker.

234
00:17:43,794 --> 00:17:45,585
This one's for you, boy!

235
00:17:46,045 --> 00:17:47,243
What the fuck you--

236
00:17:48,463 --> 00:17:49,661
Who you callin' boy,
motherfucker?

237
00:17:50,131 --> 00:17:50,960
You're lucky, motherfucker!

238
00:17:51,423 --> 00:17:53,083
I'm through monkeying around
with your fucking ass!

239
00:17:53,549 --> 00:17:55,671
Pale, pasty, pastrami-eating,
cracker motherfucker.

240
00:17:56,134 --> 00:17:58,126
A hundred bucks
say I make you my bitch.

241
00:18:00,803 --> 00:18:02,878
Hear that?
He's trying to make ends meet...

242
00:18:03,345 --> 00:18:05,218
for his cut in welfare.
You're on!

243
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:07,761
It's eight-six, Seth.

244
00:18:08,223 --> 00:18:10,095
When I want your opinion,
I'll ask for it.

245
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:12,633
Come on. I can't cover this.
Help me out here.

246
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,097
You got a big fucking mouth.

247
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,266
I can take this niglet down.

248
00:18:16,726 --> 00:18:18,718
You couldn't take a shit.
What are you thinking?

249
00:18:19,187 --> 00:18:20,431
I will beat him.
Give me the money.

250
00:18:20,896 --> 00:18:21,678
Shut up.

251
00:18:22,146 --> 00:18:23,890
You're gonna
fucking embarrass us.

252
00:18:32,067 --> 00:18:33,692
I'll take care of this.

253
00:18:34,153 --> 00:18:35,645
Yo, I ain't got time for this.

254
00:18:36,112 --> 00:18:37,310
Hey!

255
00:18:38,404 --> 00:18:39,649
I got a bet.

256
00:18:41,032 --> 00:18:43,437
I come in this game right now.
Same score...

257
00:18:43,907 --> 00:18:46,278
but we play black guys
against the white guys.

258
00:18:51,577 --> 00:18:53,285
Name your price, cracker.

259
00:18:53,746 --> 00:18:55,783
No money. For these courts.

260
00:18:56,246 --> 00:18:57,704
And not just today. For good.

261
00:18:58,164 --> 00:18:59,622
If you win,
we will walk away...

262
00:19:00,081 --> 00:19:03,579
but if we win,
no bitching, no fighting.

263
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:06,662
Right here in front of
everybody, pack up your shit...

264
00:19:07,128 --> 00:19:08,668
and get your black asses
out of here.

265
00:19:09,128 --> 00:19:10,538
Fuck that. Take this bet.

266
00:19:11,004 --> 00:19:11,999
Eight to six. Our ball.

267
00:19:12,463 --> 00:19:14,088
Let's go.

268
00:19:29,512 --> 00:19:31,137
Pick him up!

269
00:19:38,183 --> 00:19:40,175
Seth,
get back and play some "D."

270
00:19:56,151 --> 00:19:57,348
Defense!

271
00:20:05,448 --> 00:20:07,819
Pass the fucking ball!
I was wide open!

272
00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:24,153
Bullshit.
That's fuckin' offense.

273
00:20:24,622 --> 00:20:25,867
Get out of here.
He moved his feet.

274
00:20:26,332 --> 00:20:28,952
You want to go, I'm ready!
Don't throw elbows at me!

275
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,787
You want to go,Adolf Hitler
wannabe motherfucker?

276
00:20:43,173 --> 00:20:45,296
-You OK?
-Yeah. Give me some water.

277
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:47,466
You gotta call offense
on that shit.

278
00:20:47,926 --> 00:20:49,205
Not on game point, Danny.

279
00:20:49,676 --> 00:20:51,419
You can't let those niggers
get away with that shit.

280
00:20:51,887 --> 00:20:52,668
It's game point.

281
00:20:53,137 --> 00:20:54,464
Shut 'em down. Kick some ass.

282
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:57,087
Watch this.

283
00:21:50,748 --> 00:21:51,696
Bye-bye.

284
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:53,410
Get the fuck off my court!

285
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:54,657
This is my house!

286
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:56,452
Fuck you, bitch!

287
00:22:08,673 --> 00:22:10,168
Get the fuck out of here!

288
00:22:10,633 --> 00:22:12,008
This is my court!

289
00:22:22,347 --> 00:22:24,552
Derek wouldn't let us visit him
in prison.

290
00:22:25,014 --> 00:22:27,469
He said it would make it
just too hard for him...

291
00:22:27,934 --> 00:22:30,601
and that if we came,
he wouldn't see us anyhow.

292
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:33,763
Three years without him,
just wondering.

293
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:38,511
And then at 7:00 this morning...

294
00:22:38,981 --> 00:22:41,552
we picked him up
outside the gate.

295
00:22:47,901 --> 00:22:50,438
The whole ride back,
he didn't say anything.

296
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:51,898
I wanted to stay home,
but he said...

297
00:22:52,362 --> 00:22:53,939
"No. Go to school.
I'll see you later."

298
00:23:08,619 --> 00:23:11,026
Oh, come on.
Give the guy a break.

299
00:23:11,495 --> 00:23:13,950
What? You too big
to give me a hug,tough guy?

300
00:23:14,415 --> 00:23:16,073
No, man. I just know
you're gonna need someone...

301
00:23:16,539 --> 00:23:17,950
to look after you while
you adjust to all this space.

302
00:23:18,416 --> 00:23:19,660
Yeah, right.

303
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:22,999
This place is smaller
than the old living room.

304
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,657
How you doing? How's school?

305
00:23:25,128 --> 00:23:26,372
It's good.

306
00:23:26,837 --> 00:23:28,461
You gotta do something
about that hair.

307
00:23:28,921 --> 00:23:29,833
That do's gotta go.

308
00:23:30,297 --> 00:23:32,621
-The girls like it.
-Well, I don't.

309
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:36,291
You're keeping it pretty close.
You took it all the way down.

310
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,339
Shit. Look. I forgot, man.

311
00:23:40,678 --> 00:23:42,550
It hurt like shit
when they put it on.

312
00:23:43,011 --> 00:23:44,468
When'd you get that?

313
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:46,637
I got it about a month ago.

314
00:23:47,097 --> 00:23:48,887
Cameron made it official.

315
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,473
He put this on you?

316
00:24:00,478 --> 00:24:01,260
What?

317
00:24:01,728 --> 00:24:03,637
Oh, hi. He's here.

318
00:24:04,104 --> 00:24:05,515
Derek, it's for you.

319
00:24:05,981 --> 00:24:07,771
Nothing.

320
00:24:08,232 --> 00:24:11,017
Is there a phone in the back?
I'll get it in the back.

321
00:24:19,196 --> 00:24:21,768
I got it. Yeah?

322
00:24:22,239 --> 00:24:23,437
Oh, hey.

323
00:24:25,949 --> 00:24:27,194
What?

324
00:24:27,658 --> 00:24:29,614
My eyes have seen the glory...

325
00:24:30,076 --> 00:24:31,735
of the trampling at the zoo.

326
00:24:32,202 --> 00:24:34,774
We've washed ourselves
in nigger's blood...

327
00:24:35,244 --> 00:24:37,486
and all the mongrels,too.

328
00:24:37,954 --> 00:24:40,113
We're taking down
the Zog machine...

329
00:24:40,582 --> 00:24:42,288
Jew by Jew by Jew.

330
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:46,246
The white man marches on.

331
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:49,661
You think our friend
was behind that?

332
00:24:51,128 --> 00:24:52,372
I don't even care.

333
00:24:52,837 --> 00:24:54,544
I'm gonna take care
of that tonight.

334
00:24:55,004 --> 00:24:58,502
My sweet kids. My baby boy.

335
00:24:58,965 --> 00:25:01,917
God,what's with
the love fest,you guys?

336
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:10,088
No. He'll do it.
I'll make sure he does it.

337
00:25:10,554 --> 00:25:12,095
I'll get it.

338
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:20,350
I came to see the man.

339
00:25:20,809 --> 00:25:23,974
-Can you fit through the door?
-Fuck you!

340
00:25:25,937 --> 00:25:28,094
What's up, Dan? How you doing?

341
00:25:28,562 --> 00:25:30,554
-Where's Derek?
-He's on the phone.

342
00:25:31,022 --> 00:25:34,057
Come out,you free motherfucker!
Where the fuck are you?

343
00:25:34,525 --> 00:25:37,807
Hang on. Give me a minute.

344
00:25:39,026 --> 00:25:40,899
I'll be out in a minute.

345
00:25:55,408 --> 00:25:56,405
I'll be careful.

346
00:25:56,868 --> 00:26:00,201
I'm not gonna stay
in my room the rest of my life.

347
00:26:00,662 --> 00:26:01,942
Hold on.

348
00:26:02,412 --> 00:26:05,412
Hey. What the fuck
is Seth doing here?

349
00:26:05,872 --> 00:26:07,414
Did you invite him over?

350
00:26:07,874 --> 00:26:09,866
No. He always comes over here.

351
00:26:11,668 --> 00:26:13,541
Danny, give me a minute.

352
00:26:14,002 --> 00:26:16,206
Just give me one minute.

353
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:37,795
Are you still here, Goodyear?

354
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:41,712
You calling me a blimp,
you fucking Democrat?

355
00:26:42,182 --> 00:26:46,724
When was the last time you were
actually able to see your feet?

356
00:26:49,435 --> 00:26:50,929
Come in here, Danny.

357
00:26:55,897 --> 00:26:57,769
Are you going to Cam's party
tonight?

358
00:26:58,232 --> 00:27:00,189
Is Davina's ass watertight?

359
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:02,059
You're fucking sick, man.

360
00:27:02,525 --> 00:27:05,229
All right, relax.
Let me ask you afew questions.

361
00:27:05,694 --> 00:27:07,353
I'm not in the mood.
I got homework.

362
00:27:07,819 --> 00:27:10,356
Tell me some of the shit
you've learned,fuckass...

363
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:11,983
before I pistol-whip you.

364
00:27:12,446 --> 00:27:15,114
OK. I believe in death,
destruction...

365
00:27:15,572 --> 00:27:17,398
chaos,filth, and greed.

366
00:27:17,867 --> 00:27:21,399
Cut the shit, Dan. Come on.
Tell me what I want to hear.

367
00:27:22,618 --> 00:27:24,195
You mean that shit
about your mother?

368
00:27:24,662 --> 00:27:27,447
You want to get
fucking beaten, Danny?

369
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:32,162
I'm not fucking talking to you.
Shut up.

370
00:27:32,623 --> 00:27:35,243
Look,you gotta let me do this
my own way, all right?

371
00:27:36,958 --> 00:27:38,369
I'll take care of it.

372
00:27:38,834 --> 00:27:40,377
Who do you hate, Danny?

373
00:27:40,836 --> 00:27:43,290
I hate anyone
that isn't white Protestant.

374
00:27:43,753 --> 00:27:44,536
Why?

375
00:27:45,004 --> 00:27:47,127
They're a burden to the
advancement of the white race.

376
00:27:47,589 --> 00:27:48,371
Some are all right.

377
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:50,796
None of them
are fucking all right, OK?

378
00:27:51,258 --> 00:27:54,126
They're all a bunch
of fucking freeloaders.

379
00:27:54,593 --> 00:27:56,383
We don't know 'em.
We don't want to know 'em.

380
00:27:56,843 --> 00:27:58,088
They're the fucking enemy.

381
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:01,923
What don't you like
about them...

382
00:28:02,387 --> 00:28:04,011
and say it with
some fucking conviction.

383
00:28:04,472 --> 00:28:07,306
I hate the fact it's cool
to be black these days.

384
00:28:07,765 --> 00:28:12,389
I hate this hip-hop influence
on white fucking surburbia.

385
00:28:12,852 --> 00:28:14,131
Good.

386
00:28:14,602 --> 00:28:18,301
I hate Tabitha Soren and
her Zionist MTV fucking pigs...

387
00:28:18,771 --> 00:28:19,885
telling us we should get along.

388
00:28:20,355 --> 00:28:23,105
Save the rhetorical bullshit,
Hillary Rodham Clinton...

389
00:28:23,564 --> 00:28:24,845
'cause it ain't gonna
fucking happen.

390
00:28:25,315 --> 00:28:27,023
That's some of the best shit
I've ever heard.

391
00:28:27,484 --> 00:28:30,648
l feel sorry for you, Danny.

392
00:28:31,111 --> 00:28:32,770
You don't believe
any of that shit, right?

393
00:28:33,236 --> 00:28:34,018
Shut up.

394
00:28:34,486 --> 00:28:37,569
No. Get out of the house now,
you piece of shit.

395
00:28:38,031 --> 00:28:40,271
Is that any way to talk
to a guest, a friend?

396
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,529
Derek hates you,
and you don't realize it.

397
00:28:42,991 --> 00:28:45,196
How do you know who I hate?

398
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:48,492
Back from the dead.
God bless Jesus Christ.

399
00:28:48,952 --> 00:28:51,027
God, I think you lost weight.

400
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:53,286
I can get my arms almost
all the way around you.

401
00:28:53,747 --> 00:28:57,445
Fifty fuckin' pounds, man.
Look at this hair. Holy shit.

402
00:28:57,915 --> 00:29:00,405
I told him it's gotta go.

403
00:29:00,874 --> 00:29:02,664
Grab your jacket.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

404
00:29:03,126 --> 00:29:06,908
I want to talk to him.
One second.

405
00:29:07,795 --> 00:29:12,253
Hey, listen. Did you pull
some shit in school today?

406
00:29:12,297 --> 00:29:15,047
-Just the usual.
-This kid is awesome as hell.

407
00:29:15,506 --> 00:29:18,376
Did you turn in a paper
on "Mein Kampf"?

408
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:22,503
-Sweeney shit his pants.
-He did, man.

409
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:25,541
Was that your idea or
did Cameron put you up to that?

410
00:29:26,012 --> 00:29:28,418
No. I thought it would be cool.
How'd you know?

411
00:29:28,887 --> 00:29:30,631
It doesn't matter how I knew.

412
00:29:31,098 --> 00:29:33,055
This kid is smart as hell.

413
00:29:33,516 --> 00:29:35,139
Was that Sweeney on the phone?

414
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:37,010
Sweeney called and told me.

415
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:40,048
God, I hate
that fucking nigger, man.

416
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:41,846
He's gotta get a fucking life.

417
00:29:43,187 --> 00:29:44,385
Sweeney's a good teacher.

418
00:29:44,854 --> 00:29:46,680
Sweeney is a nigger
on a powertrip.

419
00:29:47,148 --> 00:29:48,770
That's what he was like
when we were there...

420
00:29:49,231 --> 00:29:51,271
and that's how he is now.
It'll never change.

421
00:29:51,733 --> 00:29:52,514
Fuck that nigger!

422
00:29:52,984 --> 00:29:54,560
-Seth, go away.
-Are you kidding?

423
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:58,026
Nope. Wait in Danny's room.
I want to talk to my brother.

424
00:29:58,486 --> 00:30:01,237
I've been here 15 minutes.
I'm starving.

425
00:30:05,614 --> 00:30:08,981
Come here. Seriously, look.
Forget this yahoo.

426
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:11,904
He kills bugs for a living.
You don't want to be like that.

427
00:30:12,367 --> 00:30:13,483
I'm serious. It's not funny.

428
00:30:13,952 --> 00:30:15,909
Sweeney is a good teacher.
You can learn a lot from him.

429
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:18,907
Don't go fuck it up
with smallfry shit like that.

430
00:30:19,372 --> 00:30:20,485
You don't understand.

431
00:30:20,955 --> 00:30:22,663
You got to see the bullshit
paper he's making me write.

432
00:30:23,123 --> 00:30:25,328
He told me all about it.
I don't care.

433
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:28,079
You do anything he tells you
to do. I mean it.

434
00:30:28,542 --> 00:30:30,166
I don't want you getting
in trouble in school...

435
00:30:30,626 --> 00:30:33,461
trying to impress me,
taking this shit in there.

436
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,199
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

437
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:39,121
Yeah, I guess, but, I mean,
I thought you'd be happy.

438
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:40,869
Well, I'm not.

439
00:30:43,507 --> 00:30:44,705
Listen to that.

440
00:30:45,968 --> 00:30:48,208
Yeah, I know.
It's been getting worse.

441
00:30:48,677 --> 00:30:49,756
Don't worry about it.

442
00:30:50,219 --> 00:30:52,045
I'll talk to you
about this later.

443
00:30:55,055 --> 00:30:56,513
She's coughing her lungs out...

444
00:30:56,972 --> 00:30:59,215
and you're blowing this
in her face all day.

445
00:30:59,683 --> 00:31:00,513
I'm putting it out.

446
00:31:00,975 --> 00:31:04,473
Hey, come on.
I want to talk to you.

447
00:31:08,728 --> 00:31:11,763
Mommy, are you OK?

448
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:19,018
Put that out.

449
00:31:19,485 --> 00:31:22,317
I was just yelling at him
for blowing smoke in your face.

450
00:31:22,777 --> 00:31:24,733
Nice thing to come home to, huh?

451
00:31:27,446 --> 00:31:28,690
You all right?

452
00:31:29,781 --> 00:31:30,979
You all right?

453
00:31:36,992 --> 00:31:39,150
Look,you got to take it easy.

454
00:31:39,619 --> 00:31:41,076
You got to get some rest.

455
00:31:41,536 --> 00:31:43,279
Take Danny's and my room,
and we'll hit the couch.

456
00:31:43,745 --> 00:31:46,201
I've been on the couch for ages.
The couch is fine.

457
00:31:46,664 --> 00:31:48,074
No, it's not fine.
This is terrible.

458
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:52,238
We can't live like this.
We gotta get out of here.

459
00:31:54,459 --> 00:31:56,202
Can I go with you?

460
00:31:56,669 --> 00:31:59,419
Yeah.
We all gotta get out of here.

461
00:31:59,879 --> 00:32:03,127
-I could drop out and get a job.
-Absolutely not.

462
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:05,544
You got to finish.
I'll work something out.

463
00:32:09,133 --> 00:32:13,460
Derek, can we please go eat?
I'm fucking starving here.

464
00:32:13,927 --> 00:32:15,634
Go wait in the living room.

465
00:32:16,887 --> 00:32:18,677
I want him out of my house.

466
00:32:19,139 --> 00:32:20,680
I know. Look.

467
00:32:35,813 --> 00:32:38,350
He's an idiot.
He's always been an idiot.

468
00:32:38,814 --> 00:32:41,220
He can't help it.
I got to do that paper.

469
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:43,432
I'll catch up with you
later tonight.

470
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,650
Not at Cameron's. I need you
to stay away from there.

471
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:50,274
-We were going to hang.
-I'll explain it later.

472
00:32:50,737 --> 00:32:52,480
I just need you to stay away
from the party, all right?

473
00:32:52,947 --> 00:32:53,977
Whatever.

474
00:32:54,446 --> 00:32:57,400
Promise me you'll stay away
from that party tonight.

475
00:32:57,866 --> 00:33:00,153
I'm not fucking 14 anymore,
all right?

476
00:33:01,408 --> 00:33:02,606
Whatever.

477
00:33:04,619 --> 00:33:05,781
God!

478
00:33:11,747 --> 00:33:13,537
Come on, let's go.

479
00:33:15,123 --> 00:33:16,036
Where are you parked?

480
00:33:16,499 --> 00:33:17,697
Out back.

481
00:34:26,617 --> 00:34:28,109
Yeah,that's the whole bunch.

482
00:34:28,575 --> 00:34:32,239
It didn't take long for Derek
to make a name for himself...

483
00:34:32,704 --> 00:34:34,445
and Cameron knew
just how to use it.

484
00:34:34,912 --> 00:34:35,907
You don't want to stick around?

485
00:34:36,372 --> 00:34:39,988
You know I'd love to,
but I got to be careful.

486
00:34:40,457 --> 00:34:42,032
Yeah, I know.

487
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:44,915
I'll see you back at the house.

488
00:34:46,169 --> 00:34:47,199
Good luck.

489
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:51,249
He sent Derek to the kids,
to the frustrated ones...

490
00:34:51,713 --> 00:34:53,087
the ones who were sick
of getting their asses kicked...

491
00:34:53,547 --> 00:34:55,585
by black and Mexican gangs.

492
00:34:56,048 --> 00:34:58,502
"Don't just be some punk.
Be part of something."

493
00:34:58,967 --> 00:35:01,372
All right, let's go.
Pull it together.

494
00:35:01,841 --> 00:35:03,086
And everybody ate it up.

495
00:35:03,551 --> 00:35:05,958
They did whatever Derek
told them to.

496
00:35:06,761 --> 00:35:09,334
Let's go. We're not here
to fucking socialize.

497
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:11,962
Shut the fuck up.

498
00:35:12,432 --> 00:35:13,213
Yeah, man.

499
00:35:13,682 --> 00:35:14,961
You want a little toke?

500
00:35:16,557 --> 00:35:17,423
Go ahead.

501
00:35:17,892 --> 00:35:20,179
-Curtis,what is that?
-Come on, Derek.

502
00:35:20,643 --> 00:35:22,800
Weed is for niggers.
Put that away right now.

503
00:35:23,269 --> 00:35:24,052
Jesus fucking Christ.

504
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,014
Have a little self-respect.

505
00:35:27,605 --> 00:35:31,471
All right, listen up.
We need to open our eyes.

506
00:35:32,775 --> 00:35:34,979
There's over two million
illegal immigrants...

507
00:35:35,442 --> 00:35:37,848
bedding down
in this state tonight.

508
00:35:39,445 --> 00:35:42,479
This state spent three
billion dollars last year...

509
00:35:42,946 --> 00:35:45,815
on services for those people
who had no right to be here.

510
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,443
Three billion dollars.

511
00:35:47,906 --> 00:35:52,117
$400 million just to lock up
illegal immigrant criminals...

512
00:35:52,576 --> 00:35:55,859
who only got into this country
because the INS decided...

513
00:35:56,327 --> 00:36:00,322
it's not worth the effort
to screen for convicted felons.

514
00:36:02,372 --> 00:36:04,695
Our government
doesn't give a shit.

515
00:36:06,416 --> 00:36:10,197
Our border policy is a joke,
so is anybody surprised...

516
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,576
that south of the border
they're laughing at us?

517
00:36:13,044 --> 00:36:14,952
Laughing at our laws?

518
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,664
Every night,thousands
of these parasites...

519
00:36:17,129 --> 00:36:19,584
stream across the border like
some fucking piñata exploded.

520
00:36:20,047 --> 00:36:23,212
Don't laugh.
There's nothing funny here.

521
00:36:23,674 --> 00:36:25,334
This is about your life
and mine.

522
00:36:25,801 --> 00:36:28,918
It's about decent,
hard-working Americans...

523
00:36:29,385 --> 00:36:30,796
falling through the cracks
and getting the shaft...

524
00:36:31,261 --> 00:36:34,129
because their government
cares more about the rights...

525
00:36:34,595 --> 00:36:36,551
of a bunch of people
who aren't even citizens.

526
00:36:37,015 --> 00:36:38,591
On the Statue of Liberty
it says...

527
00:36:39,057 --> 00:36:41,297
"Give me your tired,
your hungry,your poor."

528
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:44,137
Well, it's Americans who are
tired and hungry and poor.

529
00:36:44,601 --> 00:36:46,178
Until you take care of that...

530
00:36:46,644 --> 00:36:49,559
close the fucking book,
because we're losing.

531
00:36:50,729 --> 00:36:53,847
We're losing our right
to pursue our destiny.

532
00:36:54,313 --> 00:36:57,230
We're losing our freedom so
a bunch of fucking foreigners...

533
00:36:57,691 --> 00:36:59,433
can come in here
and exploit our country.

534
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,686
And this isn't something
that's going on far away.

535
00:37:03,151 --> 00:37:05,819
This isn't happening places
we can't do anything about it.

536
00:37:06,279 --> 00:37:08,151
It's happening here.
Right in our neighborhood.

537
00:37:08,613 --> 00:37:10,320
Right in that building
behind you.

538
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:13,898
Archie Miller ran that grocery
store since we were kids here.

539
00:37:14,364 --> 00:37:16,772
Dave worked there.
Mike worked there.

540
00:37:17,242 --> 00:37:19,033
He went under, and now
some fucking Korean owns it...

541
00:37:19,493 --> 00:37:21,697
who fired these guys
and is making a killing...

542
00:37:22,161 --> 00:37:25,113
because he hired
40 fucking border jumpers.

543
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:26,492
I see this shit going on...

544
00:37:26,955 --> 00:37:28,496
and I don't see anybody
doing anything about it...

545
00:37:28,956 --> 00:37:30,782
and it fucking pisses me off.

546
00:37:33,041 --> 00:37:34,913
So look around you.

547
00:37:36,293 --> 00:37:37,074
This isn't
our fucking neighborhood.

548
00:37:37,544 --> 00:37:39,701
It's a battlefield.
We're on a battlefield tonight.

549
00:37:40,169 --> 00:37:41,413
Make a decision.

550
00:37:41,878 --> 00:37:44,036
Are we going to stand
on the sidelines?

551
00:37:44,505 --> 00:37:47,291
Quietly standing there
while our country gets raped?

552
00:37:48,339 --> 00:37:51,126
Are we going to ante up
and do something about it?

553
00:37:52,551 --> 00:37:54,009
You're goddamn right.

554
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:08,923
Come here!
Don't you know it's illegal...

555
00:38:09,391 --> 00:38:11,929
to hire fucking border jumpers,
you nip bastard?

556
00:38:19,647 --> 00:38:20,761
Hey, sweetheart.

557
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:23,103
No. You don't need this.
We're not going to hurt you.

558
00:38:23,566 --> 00:38:24,975
Please, please! No!

559
00:38:27,942 --> 00:38:29,222
You fucking spic!

560
00:38:32,153 --> 00:38:34,310
-No! Please!
-This bitch deserves it.

561
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:38,693
This bitch stinks. Smells like
fish and chips and guacamole.

562
00:38:39,157 --> 00:38:40,401
Here we go.

563
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:53,280
Goddamn!

564
00:38:57,374 --> 00:38:58,951
Get the fuck off me,
motherfucker!

565
00:39:06,503 --> 00:39:07,877
Viva la Mexico!

566
00:39:12,715 --> 00:39:14,670
Have a fucking bean,
you fucking beaner!

567
00:39:22,511 --> 00:39:25,216
Get some of that in there.
Throw it on.

568
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,137
That's a great colour on you.

569
00:39:27,597 --> 00:39:29,090
Now you can get
a white woman's job.

570
00:39:29,555 --> 00:39:31,180
A little better
than this one, huh?

571
00:39:31,641 --> 00:39:32,885
Yeah,white.

572
00:39:33,349 --> 00:39:35,140
Then you'll move up
in the world.

573
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:38,089
Asshole!

574
00:39:40,061 --> 00:39:40,842
Let's go!

575
00:39:41,311 --> 00:39:42,390
Everybody out!

576
00:39:42,854 --> 00:39:44,395
Now! Now!

577
00:39:47,397 --> 00:39:48,808
All right, let's go!

578
00:39:49,274 --> 00:39:50,270
Come on!

579
00:39:50,733 --> 00:39:52,357
Come on, let's go.

580
00:39:57,403 --> 00:40:00,734
No green card, no fucking work.
Comprende?

581
00:40:03,281 --> 00:40:04,063
Come on!

582
00:40:04,531 --> 00:40:06,440
We're fucking going! Come on!

583
00:40:32,628 --> 00:40:36,162
Dad was gone, but things
were almost normal again.

584
00:40:36,631 --> 00:40:37,875
Derek had a good job.

585
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,798
Mom was starting
to live a little.

586
00:40:40,257 --> 00:40:43,956
Everyone was feeling so good,
we just didn't see it coming.

587
00:40:44,426 --> 00:40:45,885
Maybe we should've.

588
00:40:46,927 --> 00:40:48,088
The irony is
that most of the stores...

589
00:40:48,553 --> 00:40:50,841
destroyed during the riots
were owned by black people.

590
00:40:51,304 --> 00:40:54,007
That's stupid,though.
Why trash your neighborhood?

591
00:40:54,472 --> 00:40:57,009
Well,that's my point.
It's an irrational act.

592
00:40:57,474 --> 00:40:59,015
It's like an expression
of rage...

593
00:40:59,475 --> 00:41:03,056
by people who feel neglected
and turned away by the system.

594
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:08,758
It's like we had in Watts
or the riots in Chicago in '68.

595
00:41:09,229 --> 00:41:10,261
I don't buy that.

596
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:12,888
Calling a riot an irrational
expression of rage.

597
00:41:13,357 --> 00:41:15,763
That's such a cop-out.
It's opportunism at its worst.

598
00:41:16,233 --> 00:41:17,892
It's people grabbing
any excuse they can find...

599
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,900
to go and loot a store,
nothing more.

600
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,102
The fact that these people
ripped off the stores...

601
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:24,146
in their own communities,
all that reflects...

602
00:41:24,612 --> 00:41:27,066
is that they have no respect
forthe law at all...

603
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:29,902
and certainly no concept
of community...

604
00:41:30,365 --> 00:41:31,480
or civic responsibility.

605
00:41:31,949 --> 00:41:32,779
Now wait a minute.

606
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:35,198
White people commit crimes
against white people,too.

607
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:38,825
Yeah, but they're not offing
each other in record numbers.

608
00:41:39,286 --> 00:41:40,827
Look at the statistics,
for Christ's sake.

609
00:41:41,286 --> 00:41:42,910
One in every three
black males...

610
00:41:43,372 --> 00:41:45,281
is in some phase
of the correctional system.

611
00:41:45,748 --> 00:41:46,826
Is that a coincidence...

612
00:41:47,289 --> 00:41:49,495
or do these people have
a racial commitment to crime?

613
00:41:49,958 --> 00:41:51,915
Not only that.
They're proud of it.

614
00:41:52,376 --> 00:41:53,750
Maybe it says something
about prejudice...

615
00:41:54,209 --> 00:41:55,158
in the judicial system.

616
00:41:55,627 --> 00:41:57,536
If you want to talk
about criminal statistics...

617
00:41:58,004 --> 00:42:00,919
take a look at the social
inequalities that produce them.

618
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:03,123
That's exactly what I hate.

619
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:06,257
You're taking one thing
and calling it something else...

620
00:42:06,716 --> 00:42:08,791
and just alleviating
the responsibility...

621
00:42:09,258 --> 00:42:10,290
these people have
for their own actions.

622
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,842
It's like saying,
it's not a riot, it's rage.

623
00:42:14,302 --> 00:42:17,302
It's not crime, it's poverty.
That's just nonsense.

624
00:42:17,762 --> 00:42:19,257
It's exactly what happened
in this trial...

625
00:42:19,722 --> 00:42:21,001
because the media
twisted things around...

626
00:42:21,473 --> 00:42:23,631
so people got all focused
on these cops...

627
00:42:24,099 --> 00:42:25,262
and whether or not they were
going to get convicted...

628
00:42:25,725 --> 00:42:28,297
and whether Rodney King's
civil rights had been violated.

629
00:42:28,768 --> 00:42:30,641
Everybody lost sight
of old Rodney King himself.

630
00:42:31,103 --> 00:42:33,722
The guy's a multiple felon
by his own admission.

631
00:42:34,188 --> 00:42:35,597
He's high as a goddamn kite...

632
00:42:36,064 --> 00:42:38,270
driving 120 miles an hour
down the highway.

633
00:42:38,732 --> 00:42:40,309
He gets pulled over
by a bunch of cops...

634
00:42:40,774 --> 00:42:41,853
and he attacks them.

635
00:42:42,316 --> 00:42:43,099
He attacked police officers.

636
00:42:43,567 --> 00:42:44,730
That's the bottom line,
and he walked.

637
00:42:45,194 --> 00:42:46,936
And there's some yahoo there
with a video camera...

638
00:42:47,402 --> 00:42:48,433
who turned it on
halfway through...

639
00:42:48,904 --> 00:42:50,859
so that all we see
is them hitting him.

640
00:42:51,322 --> 00:42:54,485
You got Powell and Koon
cracking him with billy clubs...

641
00:42:54,948 --> 00:42:56,821
and Briseno's kicking him
in the back of the skull...

642
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:58,148
so it looks severe,you know?

643
00:42:58,617 --> 00:42:59,565
People are going,
"Oh,this poor guy."

644
00:43:00,033 --> 00:43:01,575
This poor guy
who attacked four cops...

645
00:43:02,034 --> 00:43:03,493
and those cops
end up on the stand...

646
00:43:03,952 --> 00:43:08,030
defending themselves for using
standard textbook procedures.

647
00:43:08,497 --> 00:43:10,204
I don't think the tapes
showed that at all.

648
00:43:10,664 --> 00:43:13,368
You didn't think so?
And you're an authority?

649
00:43:13,832 --> 00:43:16,119
Murray,what do you think?

650
00:43:17,876 --> 00:43:21,291
I did think the police used
their clubs rather excessively.

651
00:43:21,753 --> 00:43:22,951
Who are you
to say what's excessive?

652
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:24,831
I think it was
totally appropriate.

653
00:43:25,296 --> 00:43:27,965
They're in a better position
to make that call than you are.

654
00:43:28,423 --> 00:43:31,754
We, as society, grant cops
a certain amount of authority...

655
00:43:32,217 --> 00:43:33,792
to make those calls,
because we acknowledge...

656
00:43:34,258 --> 00:43:36,084
that their job is difficult
and dangerous.

657
00:43:36,552 --> 00:43:39,918
Very few people respect that
and respect that authority.

658
00:43:40,386 --> 00:43:42,877
Look who's talking about
respect--Mr. Junior KKK.

659
00:43:43,347 --> 00:43:44,591
What?

660
00:43:46,307 --> 00:43:48,133
You want to go to college?
Learn to listen.

661
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:51,552
I didn't say I respect the laws.
I acknowledge a cop's authority.

662
00:43:52,017 --> 00:43:55,052
I don't respect laws that let
Rodney King back on the street.

663
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:58,436
Second, I am not a member
of a low-rent...

664
00:43:58,896 --> 00:44:02,725
disorganized bunch of rednecks
like the fucking KKK. Please.

665
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:05,477
So take your head
out of your ass.

666
00:44:05,941 --> 00:44:07,268
You've gotten off the point.

667
00:44:07,733 --> 00:44:09,772
I had a point.
That wasn't even the point.

668
00:44:10,235 --> 00:44:11,728
Do you have one?
What is your point?

669
00:44:12,194 --> 00:44:13,735
All right,think about this.

670
00:44:14,194 --> 00:44:16,152
If Danny was walking
across the street that night...

671
00:44:16,613 --> 00:44:17,442
and Rodney King
plowed into him--

672
00:44:17,906 --> 00:44:19,980
Can we drop
this Rodney King thing?

673
00:44:29,787 --> 00:44:31,244
Who would like some dessert?

674
00:44:33,287 --> 00:44:34,069
We're having a discussion.

675
00:44:34,538 --> 00:44:36,246
We're having
a nice discussion, right?

676
00:44:36,706 --> 00:44:37,820
If Rodney King
had been driving along...

677
00:44:38,291 --> 00:44:39,831
hopped up on PCP
and had killed Danny...

678
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:41,287
you'd be singing
a different tune--

679
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:44,287
I didn't see him hit anybody,
and neither did you.

680
00:44:44,752 --> 00:44:46,873
He didn't happen
to kill anybody,thank God.

681
00:44:47,336 --> 00:44:49,909
Keep it down, OK?
Ally's sleeping.

682
00:44:52,839 --> 00:44:55,957
If that fucking monkey
had run some kid over...

683
00:44:56,424 --> 00:44:59,293
everybody would have
a very different opinion.

684
00:44:59,759 --> 00:45:02,627
They'd be focused on Rodney King
and not on these officers.

685
00:45:03,094 --> 00:45:04,719
But instead,
he just attacked a few cops...

686
00:45:05,179 --> 00:45:06,423
so, suddenly,
it's Hands Across America...

687
00:45:06,887 --> 00:45:08,464
for this fucking total
son of a bitch.

688
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:09,878
It blows my mind.

689
00:45:10,347 --> 00:45:12,753
We're so hung up on this notion
that we have some obligation...

690
00:45:13,224 --> 00:45:14,883
to help
this struggling black man.

691
00:45:15,349 --> 00:45:17,222
Cut him some slack
until he can overcome...

692
00:45:17,685 --> 00:45:18,680
these historical injustices.

693
00:45:19,143 --> 00:45:21,100
It's crap. This stuff
just perpetuates it...

694
00:45:21,561 --> 00:45:22,759
all this liberal nonsense.

695
00:45:23,229 --> 00:45:24,142
Everyone's looking
the otherway...

696
00:45:24,605 --> 00:45:26,180
while our country rots
from the inside out.

697
00:45:26,647 --> 00:45:29,812
I mean, Christ, Lincoln freed
the slaves 130 years ago.

698
00:45:30,274 --> 00:45:31,898
How long does it take
to get your act together?

699
00:45:32,358 --> 00:45:35,974
Jews have been persecuted
for over 5,000 years.

700
00:45:36,444 --> 00:45:38,435
Are you saying it's wrong
to feel sensitive...

701
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:39,684
about anti-Semitism?

702
00:45:40,153 --> 00:45:41,102
Oh,forget that.

703
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:44,239
I'm with you. I'm with you
all the way, baby.

704
00:45:44,698 --> 00:45:46,025
I'm so sick of
these liberal hypocrites.

705
00:45:46,489 --> 00:45:48,067
Here we go again.
I love this part.

706
00:45:48,532 --> 00:45:49,315
This is great.

707
00:45:49,784 --> 00:45:51,277
Look how they scapegoated
Chief Gates.

708
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,864
Think they would've come down
that hard on Willie Williams?

709
00:45:54,327 --> 00:45:57,361
No way. That videotape was
a set-up to get rid of Gates.

710
00:45:57,830 --> 00:46:00,781
-Can I be excused?
-No. Don't interrupt.

711
00:46:01,247 --> 00:46:03,156
Excuse me. I was talking.
I listened to you.

712
00:46:03,623 --> 00:46:06,741
-Who do you think you are?
-She's making a point.

713
00:46:07,207 --> 00:46:09,116
Davina, sit down.

714
00:46:09,584 --> 00:46:12,501
Be quiet! Shut up! Sit down!

715
00:46:12,961 --> 00:46:15,710
-Derek, calm down.
-Don't tell him to shut up!

716
00:46:16,172 --> 00:46:18,791
Sit your ass down. No.
Sit down. Shut your mouth.

717
00:46:19,256 --> 00:46:21,378
Move! Goddamn it! Move!

718
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,748
Shut your mouth and give
my girlfriend respect.

719
00:46:24,218 --> 00:46:26,089
Derek,what are you
trying to prove?

720
00:46:26,551 --> 00:46:27,713
Murray, stay out of it!

721
00:46:28,177 --> 00:46:29,919
Where do you think you're going?

722
00:46:30,386 --> 00:46:32,758
Derek, let her go!

723
00:46:33,221 --> 00:46:36,387
You need to learn
some fucking manners, Davina!

724
00:46:36,848 --> 00:46:38,638
Shut yourfucking mouth!

725
00:46:39,099 --> 00:46:40,296
Stop!

726
00:46:41,558 --> 00:46:42,803
She can't breathe!

727
00:46:44,769 --> 00:46:45,550
Let her go!

728
00:46:46,019 --> 00:46:47,927
You going to apologize?

729
00:46:49,937 --> 00:46:53,138
You're a fucking asshole.
I hate you!

730
00:47:03,069 --> 00:47:04,776
What are you doing?
This is your family.

731
00:47:05,236 --> 00:47:06,694
Right.
My family, so you know what?

732
00:47:07,153 --> 00:47:10,189
I don't give two shits about you
or what you think.

733
00:47:10,656 --> 00:47:11,983
You're not a part of it.

734
00:47:12,449 --> 00:47:14,523
-That has nothing to do with it.
-It doesn't?

735
00:47:14,992 --> 00:47:16,366
You don't think
I see what you're doing?

736
00:47:16,826 --> 00:47:17,857
You think
I'll sit here and smile...

737
00:47:18,327 --> 00:47:20,530
while some fucking kike
tries to fuck my mother?

738
00:47:20,995 --> 00:47:23,484
It's never going to happen.
Fucking forget it.

739
00:47:23,954 --> 00:47:25,329
Not while I'm in this family.

740
00:47:25,788 --> 00:47:27,411
I will fucking cut
your Shylock nose off...

741
00:47:27,872 --> 00:47:30,161
and stick it up your ass
before I let that happen.

742
00:47:30,624 --> 00:47:32,781
Coming in here and poisoning
my family's dinner...

743
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:36,334
with your Jewish,
nigger-loving, hippie bullshit.

744
00:47:39,962 --> 00:47:42,499
Fuck you. Fuck you.

745
00:47:42,964 --> 00:47:44,292
Yeah,walk out.

746
00:47:44,756 --> 00:47:46,747
Asshole. Fucking
cabala-reading motherfucker.

747
00:47:47,215 --> 00:47:48,838
Get out of my house.

748
00:47:53,885 --> 00:47:56,043
You see this?
That means not welcome.

749
00:48:08,768 --> 00:48:09,549
What did I do?

750
00:48:10,019 --> 00:48:11,512
You disgust me.

751
00:48:11,977 --> 00:48:14,135
Bring him to ourtable, primping
your hair and your dress.

752
00:48:14,604 --> 00:48:16,477
What did I do?

753
00:48:16,938 --> 00:48:18,432
You're all tarted up.

754
00:48:18,897 --> 00:48:20,094
How could you bring him
to my father's table?

755
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:23,399
How could you go from Dad
to that? Aren't you ashamed?

756
00:48:23,858 --> 00:48:27,106
I'm ashamed that you
came out of my body!

757
00:48:30,654 --> 00:48:33,486
Go run to your fucking kike!
Run to him!

758
00:48:39,615 --> 00:48:42,532
It's OK.
I'm proud of you, baby.

759
00:48:49,246 --> 00:48:52,908
I'm so sorry, Doris.
I really am.

760
00:49:01,043 --> 00:49:01,824
He's gone.

761
00:49:02,294 --> 00:49:06,620
He's just a boy
without a father.

762
00:49:07,087 --> 00:49:10,870
Doris,you don't know the world
your children are living in.

763
00:49:20,761 --> 00:49:22,302
Good-bye.

764
00:50:07,784 --> 00:50:09,278
Hey,you all right?

765
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:14,656
-Take this,you fucking dick!
-No. Come here.

766
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,199
-Fuck you!
-Calm down.

767
00:50:16,664 --> 00:50:17,612
-Let go of me!
-Calm down.

768
00:50:18,081 --> 00:50:18,862
Let me go, God damn it!

769
00:50:19,331 --> 00:50:21,453
-Fuck you!
-I'm sorry.

770
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,039
I would never hurt you.
You know that.

771
00:50:25,501 --> 00:50:28,619
I screwed up. I lost control.
It's not you.

772
00:50:29,086 --> 00:50:31,837
I'm sorry.
I'd never hurt you guys.

773
00:50:32,296 --> 00:50:34,667
You know that.
I'd do anything for you.

774
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:35,912
I don't believe you.

775
00:50:36,381 --> 00:50:38,705
I trust you, Derek.

776
00:50:50,013 --> 00:50:52,633
What are you doing out of bed?
Want a plane ride?

777
00:50:53,097 --> 00:50:56,014
-Yeah.
-Going for takeoff.

778
00:51:02,311 --> 00:51:03,770
Oh, no, don't crash.

779
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:08,470
Better go to Mom.
She's a crazy flier.

780
00:51:08,939 --> 00:51:11,891
Kiss Mom. Oh,yeah.

781
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:23,360
-You don't feel too hot.
-No. It's my chest.

782
00:51:23,822 --> 00:51:25,859
-What are you up to?
-I'm just thinking.

783
00:51:26,322 --> 00:51:28,443
Yeah? There's a lot of that
going around.

784
00:51:28,907 --> 00:51:31,313
I don't even know
how we got here sometimes.

785
00:51:31,784 --> 00:51:34,107
l feel like I let you down, only
I didn't know when it happened.

786
00:51:34,576 --> 00:51:36,154
Mom, it's OK.

787
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:41,698
It's cold in here.
No wonder you're sick.

788
00:51:42,164 --> 00:51:44,488
You don't get sick from cold.
You get sick from germs.

789
00:51:44,956 --> 00:51:47,624
No. You get sick from smoking.

790
00:51:48,917 --> 00:51:52,330
You ought to quit.
It's not good for you.

791
00:51:58,005 --> 00:51:59,627
What are you looking at me
like that for?

792
00:52:00,088 --> 00:52:02,958
When are you going to let
that beautiful hair grow back?

793
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,790
The day you quit smoking.

794
00:52:09,885 --> 00:52:10,965
Deal.

795
00:52:11,428 --> 00:52:15,673
I'd better get Ally to bed.
You say good night to Mom?

796
00:52:16,138 --> 00:52:17,881
Then you have to go to bed.
Come on.

797
00:52:18,348 --> 00:52:20,919
-Good night, Mama.
-Good night, baby.

798
00:52:55,114 --> 00:52:58,317
I go back to that night
again and again in my mind.

799
00:52:58,783 --> 00:53:00,527
I try to stop it from happening.

800
00:53:00,993 --> 00:53:02,535
I want you out of this house.

801
00:53:02,995 --> 00:53:04,902
That's fine.
I'll be gone in the morning.

802
00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:07,699
He can move in with me.

803
00:53:08,956 --> 00:53:10,865
In my mind, I imagine
what would've happened...

804
00:53:11,332 --> 00:53:14,781
if I hadn't gone to that room
and told him.

805
00:53:16,042 --> 00:53:17,240
Get down!

806
00:53:18,669 --> 00:53:19,865
No, Derek!

807
00:53:21,586 --> 00:53:23,874
Help, Mommy!

808
00:53:37,887 --> 00:53:40,802
Nigger,you just fucked
with the wrong bull. Come here!

809
00:53:41,263 --> 00:53:42,045
Damn!

810
00:53:42,514 --> 00:53:45,548
Should've learned your place on
the fucking basketball court...

811
00:53:46,015 --> 00:53:47,639
but you fucking monkeys
never get the message!

812
00:53:49,225 --> 00:53:51,264
My father gave me that truck,
you motherfucker!

813
00:53:51,726 --> 00:53:54,891
You ever shoot at firemen?
You shoot at my family?

814
00:53:55,354 --> 00:53:57,392
I'm going to teach you a real
lesson now, motherfucker.

815
00:53:57,855 --> 00:53:59,264
Put your fucking mouth
on the curb.

816
00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:00,512
Hold on, man.

817
00:54:00,981 --> 00:54:03,934
Put it on the curb right now!

818
00:54:07,276 --> 00:54:08,057
That's it.

819
00:54:08,526 --> 00:54:10,186
Derek, no!

820
00:54:14,737 --> 00:54:16,231
Now say good night.

821
00:54:28,995 --> 00:54:30,193
Fucker.

822
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:39,324
Drop your weapon!
Put your weapon on the ground!

823
00:54:39,790 --> 00:54:41,333
Put your hands up!

824
00:54:41,793 --> 00:54:45,160
I said get your hands up!
Now turn around!

825
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:56,913
Put your hands behind your head!

826
00:55:00,593 --> 00:55:02,668
Get down on your knees
right now!

827
00:56:00,248 --> 00:56:04,114
It's all right.

828
00:56:06,083 --> 00:56:07,281
Let's go.

829
00:56:09,210 --> 00:56:11,961
-Come on.
-No.

830
00:56:19,506 --> 00:56:20,586
She ain't gonna open the door?

831
00:56:21,049 --> 00:56:23,374
Someone right fucking there
looking at us. Hello?

832
00:56:23,842 --> 00:56:25,300
Danny, it's for you.

833
00:56:26,384 --> 00:56:28,176
Be right there.

834
00:56:41,392 --> 00:56:43,965
Open the door, Danny.
It's fucking freezing!

835
00:56:44,436 --> 00:56:45,976
Danny, I'm gonna be sick!

836
00:56:46,687 --> 00:56:49,639
Come on, Danny!

837
00:57:19,994 --> 00:57:21,405
I'm gonna go get some beers.

838
00:57:34,543 --> 00:57:36,286
Hey,what a party,fatso?

839
00:57:36,753 --> 00:57:40,085
I'm not fat, asshole!
I'm husky!

840
00:57:40,546 --> 00:57:42,123
What the fuck's up, Seth?

841
00:57:42,589 --> 00:57:44,213
Drink up, Danny,
before your brother sees you.

842
00:57:44,673 --> 00:57:45,586
Holy fuck, he's here!

843
00:57:46,049 --> 00:57:48,835
Yeah, he's fucking here.
Go pay your respects.

844
00:57:49,301 --> 00:57:50,499
Fuck you, Seth!

845
00:57:52,885 --> 00:57:55,043
Let's go talk to Cameron, Danny.

846
00:57:55,512 --> 00:57:56,887
-Father Vinyard?
-How's it going?

847
00:57:57,346 --> 00:57:59,633
I'm Jason,this is Chris.
We're friends with your brother.

848
00:58:00,098 --> 00:58:02,847
You are a fucking god, man!

849
00:58:21,024 --> 00:58:22,482
I thought you turned
that paper in.

850
00:58:22,942 --> 00:58:25,266
I did. Now fucking Murray
turned me in...

851
00:58:25,735 --> 00:58:28,984
so Sweeney's making me
write another one.

852
00:58:30,738 --> 00:58:33,440
Good old Sweeney.
He never stops trying.

853
00:58:33,906 --> 00:58:36,442
He's one of those
"proud to be nigger" people.

854
00:58:36,908 --> 00:58:37,986
I hate those guys.

855
00:58:38,449 --> 00:58:41,235
Wait a minute, Danny.
He's not proud.

856
00:58:41,702 --> 00:58:46,610
No. He's a manipulative,
self-righteous Uncle Tom.

857
00:58:47,079 --> 00:58:49,913
He's making you feel guilty
about writing on Adolf Hitler.

858
00:58:50,373 --> 00:58:55,162
Some nigger, some spic writes
about Martin Luther King...

859
00:58:58,351 --> 00:59:02,298
or fucking Cesar commie Chavez
gets a pat on the head.

860
00:59:02,769 --> 00:59:04,513
Yeah.

861
00:59:04,979 --> 00:59:08,145
You can see the hypocrisy
in that, can't you?

862
00:59:08,606 --> 00:59:09,804
Definitely.

863
00:59:14,358 --> 00:59:15,438
Come on, let's go.

864
00:59:15,901 --> 00:59:18,272
No. Listen. Wait.

865
00:59:18,735 --> 00:59:20,277
I want to see you, OK?

866
00:59:20,736 --> 00:59:23,736
I do, but I gotta
take care of something tonight.

867
00:59:25,655 --> 00:59:27,944
-OK.
-You understand?

868
00:59:28,408 --> 00:59:31,608
Yeah. I'm here.
When you're ready, I'm here.

869
00:59:35,578 --> 00:59:37,652
-Would you do something with me?
-Anything.

870
00:59:38,121 --> 00:59:39,697
Leave with me.

871
00:59:40,163 --> 00:59:42,155
Leave where?

872
00:59:42,622 --> 00:59:46,072
Leave here. Leave all this.
Just come with me.

873
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:48,118
Why would you want to leave?

874
00:59:48,584 --> 00:59:49,959
They worship you.
You're like a god to them.

875
00:59:50,419 --> 00:59:53,334
If we had it good before,wait
till you see what it's like now.

876
00:59:53,794 --> 00:59:57,079
I don't want all that.
I don't want my family involved.

877
00:59:57,547 --> 00:59:59,621
Everything I've done here
fucked it all up, understand?

878
01:00:00,090 --> 01:00:01,666
You think what you did
was wrong?

879
01:00:02,132 --> 01:00:04,586
Oh, baby. Oh, come on.

880
01:00:05,050 --> 01:00:07,172
Those niggers got exactly
what they deserved...

881
01:00:07,634 --> 01:00:09,543
and we all know that.

882
01:00:10,012 --> 01:00:12,713
I understand you just got out,
but no one's gonna hurt you.

883
01:00:13,179 --> 01:00:15,087
No one can touch you.
There's a small army out there.

884
01:00:15,555 --> 01:00:17,927
We're not gonna let
a bunch of spooks kick us out.

885
01:00:18,390 --> 01:00:20,049
You're not listening to me.
I'm not scared.

886
01:00:20,515 --> 01:00:22,424
I don't want it anymore.

887
01:00:22,892 --> 01:00:26,009
I'm done with it.
I'm through with this.

888
01:00:26,478 --> 01:00:31,101
It's bullshit, Stacey.

889
01:00:33,144 --> 01:00:35,599
You don't need this, Stacey.
Come on,trust me.

890
01:00:36,063 --> 01:00:39,476
If you want to be with me,
just trust me. Come with me.

891
01:00:39,939 --> 01:00:40,720
Come on.

892
01:00:41,191 --> 01:00:44,272
You're nuts. You are nuts.
No way.

893
01:00:44,733 --> 01:00:47,436
I don't think you realize
what's been going on here.

894
01:00:47,902 --> 01:00:51,185
We are 10 times what we were,
and we are bloody organized.

895
01:00:51,652 --> 01:00:53,775
It is like nothing
you have ever seen.

896
01:00:54,237 --> 01:00:55,565
This was a mistake. Forget it.

897
01:00:56,031 --> 01:00:58,105
Wait a second.
What was a mistake?

898
01:00:58,573 --> 01:01:00,399
Stacey,just say good-bye.

899
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:03,356
This isn't you. I know you.

900
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:05,651
You don't know anything
about me, Stacey.

901
01:01:13,455 --> 01:01:15,612
-Are you Danny's brother?
-Yeah.

902
01:01:16,082 --> 01:01:18,701
Will you tell him
Lizzy's looking for him?

903
01:01:19,165 --> 01:01:21,039
Thank you.

904
01:01:22,794 --> 01:01:26,161
We'll let the niggers, kikes,
and spics grab for the pie.

905
01:01:26,628 --> 01:01:28,419
Can't blame 'em.

906
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:31,251
Course,they're gonna
have to fight to get it.

907
01:01:33,048 --> 01:01:35,585
And if we scare
the fuck out of people...

908
01:01:36,051 --> 01:01:39,631
and a few people get killed
in the process, so be it.

909
01:01:40,093 --> 01:01:42,251
Gonna put that
in your paper, Danny?

910
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,924
Hey, man.

911
01:01:45,387 --> 01:01:49,431
Well, look who's here.
The return of the soldier.

912
01:01:49,890 --> 01:01:51,431
What are you doing here, Danny?

913
01:01:51,890 --> 01:01:54,428
Come on, man.
I had to check it out.

914
01:01:54,892 --> 01:01:55,971
You knew I was gonna come.

915
01:01:56,436 --> 01:02:00,098
Let the kid alone, Derek.
He knows when to go to bed.

916
01:02:02,145 --> 01:02:02,976
Go wait outside.

917
01:02:03,438 --> 01:02:05,310
Come on, Der.
I'm not doing anything.

918
01:02:05,772 --> 01:02:08,771
This little blonde girl
keeps asking for you.

919
01:02:09,234 --> 01:02:10,560
She's dying. Come on.

920
01:02:11,025 --> 01:02:13,147
-I gotta check out.
-Go easy on her.

921
01:02:13,609 --> 01:02:15,482
All right.

922
01:02:19,404 --> 01:02:20,862
Wait for me right outside.

923
01:02:25,907 --> 01:02:27,532
Take it easy.

924
01:02:27,992 --> 01:02:30,067
Chill out.

925
01:02:30,535 --> 01:02:32,573
You're on safe ground.

926
01:02:33,036 --> 01:02:35,655
You don't have to watch
your ass around here.

927
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:38,987
Come on. Sit down. Relax.

928
01:02:40,999 --> 01:02:43,618
I'm sorry.
The party was a little quick...

929
01:02:44,083 --> 01:02:46,750
but we're just so damn glad
you're back, Derek.

930
01:02:47,209 --> 01:02:48,869
It's only natural
you should feel a little funny.

931
01:02:49,336 --> 01:02:50,449
I don't feel funny, Cam.

932
01:02:50,919 --> 01:02:53,244
You made the fat kid
a little nervous.

933
01:02:53,712 --> 01:02:55,206
He thinks the joint
messed with your mind.

934
01:02:55,672 --> 01:02:57,000
It did.

935
01:03:04,176 --> 01:03:07,875
Glory, glory, hallelujah...

936
01:03:08,345 --> 01:03:12,554
Glory, glory, hallelujah...

937
01:03:13,013 --> 01:03:16,013
The white man marches on!

938
01:03:16,474 --> 01:03:19,224
Things have changed
since you've been gone.

939
01:03:19,683 --> 01:03:21,556
You talk about organization?

940
01:03:22,018 --> 01:03:24,425
Wait'll you see what
we've done with the internet.

941
01:03:24,894 --> 01:03:26,435
We've got every gang
from Seattle to San Diego...

942
01:03:26,895 --> 01:03:28,010
working together now.

943
01:03:28,479 --> 01:03:30,436
Not competing anymore.
They're consolidated.

944
01:03:30,897 --> 01:03:32,973
Only thing we lack is
a little overall leadership.

945
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:36,191
That's where you come in.

946
01:03:36,651 --> 01:03:39,270
Those people out there got
a lot of respect for you.

947
01:03:39,735 --> 01:03:41,442
When you're ready,
come talk to me about it.

948
01:03:41,903 --> 01:03:45,351
You can forget about that.
I'm done with it, Cam.

949
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:48,987
Yeah,well,
I know you grew out of...

950
01:03:49,449 --> 01:03:52,483
that shaved head bullshit
a long time ago,thank God.

951
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:54,408
I like your hair
the way it is now.

952
01:03:54,868 --> 01:03:57,488
See,that's what I mean.
We're thinking bigger now.

953
01:03:57,952 --> 01:03:59,197
No more of this fucking
grocery store--

954
01:03:59,661 --> 01:04:01,120
You're not listening to me.
I am done with it.

955
01:04:01,579 --> 01:04:03,405
All that bullshit out there
and all your bullshit,too.

956
01:04:03,872 --> 01:04:05,068
I'm out.

957
01:04:05,538 --> 01:04:08,325
I understand how you feel.
You've just done hard time.

958
01:04:08,791 --> 01:04:10,581
Don't you fucking talk to me
about hard time.

959
01:04:11,041 --> 01:04:12,619
-You don't know anything.
-I've done mine.

960
01:04:13,084 --> 01:04:15,123
You didn't do shit.
I found out about you.

961
01:04:15,586 --> 01:04:17,128
You did two months,
then rolled over on two kids...

962
01:04:17,587 --> 01:04:19,128
and let them go down for you.

963
01:04:19,587 --> 01:04:21,496
So don't feed me
your fucking lies, Cameron.

964
01:04:23,215 --> 01:04:26,332
All right. This is stupid.
I'm done.

965
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:29,005
You go cool off.
Get laid. Do something.

966
01:04:29,468 --> 01:04:31,792
Get your head on straight,
and then I'll talk to you.

967
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:33,967
But it doesn't matter
if I don't, does it?

968
01:04:34,428 --> 01:04:35,971
'Cause you got the next crop...

969
01:04:36,430 --> 01:04:37,804
lined up and ready to go,
you fucking chicken hawk.

970
01:04:38,263 --> 01:04:39,674
Excuse me?

971
01:04:40,139 --> 01:04:42,464
You prey on people, Cam!
You use them!

972
01:04:42,933 --> 01:04:45,421
I lost three years of my life
for your fucking phoney cause...

973
01:04:45,892 --> 01:04:47,434
but I am on to you now,
you fucking snake.

974
01:04:47,893 --> 01:04:51,556
Derek,watch it. Be careful.
Remember where you are.

975
01:04:52,019 --> 01:04:55,185
This isn't some fucking country
club you can waltz in and out--

976
01:04:55,648 --> 01:04:56,974
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!

977
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:59,894
I came here to tell you
one thing. I am out.

978
01:05:00,357 --> 01:05:01,815
Out! And Danny is out,too!

979
01:05:02,276 --> 01:05:04,184
If you come near my family,
I'll fucking kill you.

980
01:05:04,651 --> 01:05:06,643
Excuse me, but fuck you, Derek.

981
01:05:07,111 --> 01:05:09,020
You can't come
barking threats at me.

982
01:05:09,488 --> 01:05:11,941
You can do whatever you want,
but Danny is a good kid.

983
01:05:12,405 --> 01:05:14,397
He's not some whiny pussy
like you.

984
01:05:14,865 --> 01:05:16,407
He needs my help,
and I'm gonna give it to him.

985
01:05:16,866 --> 01:05:18,773
If you come near Danny again...

986
01:05:19,242 --> 01:05:21,033
I will feed you
your fucking heart, Cameron.

987
01:05:21,493 --> 01:05:26,864
I won't have to.
He'll come to me.

988
01:05:27,330 --> 01:05:29,570
I'm more important to him now
than you'll ever be.

989
01:05:33,665 --> 01:05:34,495
Shit.

990
01:05:34,958 --> 01:05:37,956
You're a fucking dead man,
Vinyard.

991
01:05:54,009 --> 01:05:57,423
Hey,where's Cameron?
Where the fuck is he?

992
01:05:59,553 --> 01:06:01,296
Stay away from me, Stacey.
Danny!

993
01:06:01,762 --> 01:06:03,304
Why don't you share
with the rest of us...

994
01:06:03,763 --> 01:06:06,881
what you just said to me,
you piece of shit nigger!

995
01:06:07,349 --> 01:06:09,222
You monkey-fucking traitor!

996
01:06:09,683 --> 01:06:10,927
You a fucking nigger-fucker?

997
01:06:11,392 --> 01:06:12,933
Hey, Danny! Come on!

998
01:06:13,392 --> 01:06:15,384
He's a fucking nigger!
Nigger! Nigger!

999
01:06:15,853 --> 01:06:18,342
Cam's out cold!
Where the fuck are you going?

1000
01:06:18,813 --> 01:06:20,353
Gun! He's got a gun!

1001
01:06:20,814 --> 01:06:23,184
Shit! Back up!

1002
01:06:24,899 --> 01:06:26,356
You make me fucking sick!

1003
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:29,224
Put down the fucking gun!

1004
01:06:29,693 --> 01:06:30,557
Shoot the nigger!

1005
01:06:31,027 --> 01:06:34,394
Shoot him!
Do it, Seth! Shoot him!

1006
01:06:34,862 --> 01:06:36,439
Traitor!

1007
01:06:36,905 --> 01:06:38,362
Do it, Seth! Do it!

1008
01:06:41,531 --> 01:06:43,323
Back up! Move!

1009
01:06:45,366 --> 01:06:47,359
Back up! Back the fuck up!

1010
01:06:47,827 --> 01:06:49,783
Move! Move!

1011
01:06:50,244 --> 01:06:51,488
Easy, Derek! Hey!

1012
01:07:13,131 --> 01:07:13,912
Easy, Danny!

1013
01:07:14,382 --> 01:07:15,875
Who do you think you are?

1014
01:07:16,341 --> 01:07:18,877
-Danny, relax.
-Who do you think you are?

1015
01:07:19,342 --> 01:07:21,298
Take it easy, Dan.

1016
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:23,419
l fucking hate you, Der!

1017
01:07:23,886 --> 01:07:25,295
All right. I mean it.

1018
01:07:25,762 --> 01:07:26,923
Huh?

1019
01:07:27,387 --> 01:07:29,426
Come on. Shut up.
Take it easy.

1020
01:07:29,889 --> 01:07:31,382
What's happened to you, Der?

1021
01:07:31,847 --> 01:07:33,887
Take it easy.

1022
01:07:34,349 --> 01:07:36,720
What's happened to you, Der?

1023
01:07:44,854 --> 01:07:47,475
Come on. Come on.

1024
01:07:50,648 --> 01:07:52,440
It's just so fucked.

1025
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:55,391
I'm sorry. You weren't
supposed to see that.

1026
01:07:55,860 --> 01:07:56,642
I told you not to come.

1027
01:07:57,110 --> 01:07:59,351
Fuck you, man.

1028
01:07:59,819 --> 01:08:00,899
That was so fucked up.

1029
01:08:01,363 --> 01:08:03,402
I know, I know.

1030
01:08:03,864 --> 01:08:06,270
God, it wasn't supposed
to happen thatway.

1031
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:09,491
That was fucked up.
That's all there is to it.

1032
01:08:09,950 --> 01:08:13,234
That's not what I planned.
It just all went to shit.

1033
01:08:13,703 --> 01:08:17,484
Just shit.
Got totally out of control.

1034
01:08:18,954 --> 01:08:21,705
What's fucking happening here?

1035
01:08:26,374 --> 01:08:27,785
Hey, look at me.

1036
01:08:32,003 --> 01:08:33,200
I can't go back to that, Dan.

1037
01:08:33,670 --> 01:08:35,413
Can't go back to what?

1038
01:08:35,879 --> 01:08:37,538
To any of it.

1039
01:08:38,005 --> 01:08:40,709
Those guys,the gang,that life.
I'm done with it.

1040
01:08:44,758 --> 01:08:46,252
What happened to you up there?

1041
01:08:54,139 --> 01:08:55,798
Feed line. Back up for chow.

1042
01:08:56,264 --> 01:08:57,722
Don't be late,
you piece of shit!

1043
01:08:58,181 --> 01:09:01,714
Let's go if you want to eat!
Get up! Five minutes!

1044
01:09:02,184 --> 01:09:04,139
This is my fucking house!
Get up!

1045
01:09:04,602 --> 01:09:06,509
What the fuck's your problem,
you assholes?

1046
01:09:06,979 --> 01:09:09,812
Move! Let's go!
Open the fucking gates!

1047
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:12,641
All right, rack 'em!

1048
01:09:17,274 --> 01:09:18,982
Five minutes! Stepforward!

1049
01:09:19,442 --> 01:09:21,648
Those beds better be made.

1050
01:09:24,361 --> 01:09:26,851
After two days, I didn't think
I'd make it a week.

1051
01:09:27,321 --> 01:09:29,029
Come on,you motherfuckers!

1052
01:09:29,489 --> 01:09:31,279
You want to eat today,
you fucking piece of shit?

1053
01:09:31,739 --> 01:09:33,317
Hey,you white trash
piece of shit!

1054
01:09:33,783 --> 01:09:35,241
You think you're
fucking special,whitefish?

1055
01:09:35,701 --> 01:09:38,486
Button that top button!
Let's go! Move!

1056
01:09:38,951 --> 01:09:41,822
Are you eyeballing me?
Don't eyeball-fuck me, asshole!

1057
01:09:42,287 --> 01:09:44,362
I'll fucking kill you!

1058
01:09:44,829 --> 01:09:47,699
I'm gonna keep my eye on you,
you white piece of shit!

1059
01:09:49,666 --> 01:09:52,238
Don't fucking eyeball me, boy!
I'll fucking skull-fuck you!

1060
01:09:52,708 --> 01:09:54,617
Step forward!

1061
01:09:55,836 --> 01:09:57,032
Turn to the left.

1062
01:09:58,962 --> 01:10:02,081
Step forward to chow! Let's go!

1063
01:10:02,547 --> 01:10:04,503
Come on!
Hey,fish, straight ahead.

1064
01:10:04,964 --> 01:10:06,957
Straight ahead,fucker!
Let's go!

1065
01:10:07,424 --> 01:10:10,127
All the wrong people
knew who I was anyway...

1066
01:10:10,592 --> 01:10:13,757
so l figured I'd put up a flag
and hope a friend sees it.

1067
01:11:16,083 --> 01:11:18,999
That's the cat I'm talking
about right there.

1068
01:11:38,217 --> 01:11:39,795
Boss.

1069
01:11:40,261 --> 01:11:41,720
Have a seat.

1070
01:11:42,721 --> 01:11:43,917
It's a pleasure.

1071
01:11:54,435 --> 01:11:56,011
Don't fuck with me, all right?

1072
01:11:56,478 --> 01:11:58,304
'Cause I'm the most dangerous
man in this prison.

1073
01:11:58,770 --> 01:12:02,682
You know why?
'Cause I control the underwear.

1074
01:12:10,733 --> 01:12:13,271
We pick 'em up over here,
and we store 'em over there.

1075
01:12:13,735 --> 01:12:15,278
And I hope you work out,
all right?

1076
01:12:15,737 --> 01:12:18,191
'Cause the last guy they sent me
didn't wear no drawers...

1077
01:12:18,654 --> 01:12:20,397
couldn't read
the sizes in the drawers...

1078
01:12:20,864 --> 01:12:22,655
and used to sniff
the drawers, all right?

1079
01:12:23,115 --> 01:12:25,154
We got two sizes--medium
and large, all right?

1080
01:12:25,616 --> 01:12:27,573
All you gotta do is put
the mediums with the mediums...

1081
01:12:28,034 --> 01:12:29,148
and the larges with
the larges, all right?

1082
01:12:29,618 --> 01:12:31,159
I know it's a boring job...

1083
01:12:31,619 --> 01:12:33,445
but it's better than that
last shit they had me doing.

1084
01:12:33,912 --> 01:12:37,362
I spent two years in the kitchen
scrubbing hot-ass pots and pans.

1085
01:12:37,830 --> 01:12:40,285
That you don't wanna do,
all right?

1086
01:12:40,749 --> 01:12:42,326
You should be happy as shit
you landed this job.

1087
01:12:42,792 --> 01:12:45,577
There's no telling what they'd
have you do up in the joint.

1088
01:12:47,211 --> 01:12:50,245
By the way...

1089
01:12:50,712 --> 01:12:52,371
what you in for?

1090
01:12:55,506 --> 01:12:56,999
Probably robbed
some old lady, huh?

1091
01:13:08,804 --> 01:13:10,760
OK, I know your kind, right?

1092
01:13:11,221 --> 01:13:13,463
Bad-ass peckerwood
with an attitude.

1093
01:13:15,183 --> 01:13:18,964
Let me tell you something, man,
you better watch your ass...

1094
01:13:19,434 --> 01:13:23,216
'cause in the joint,
you the nigger, not me.

1095
01:13:27,022 --> 01:13:30,305
I was a year in.
I thought I was cruising.

1096
01:13:30,772 --> 01:13:33,559
Then everything started
getting complicated.

1097
01:14:00,621 --> 01:14:02,163
What the fuck is that?

1098
01:14:03,456 --> 01:14:04,321
What's that all about?

1099
01:14:04,790 --> 01:14:08,537
That's just politics, man.
Favors,you know?

1100
01:14:10,251 --> 01:14:13,120
He's doing favours
for that fucking spic?

1101
01:14:14,210 --> 01:14:16,167
Mitch has just got
a little something extra...

1102
01:14:16,628 --> 01:14:18,620
on the side
with them boys,you know?

1103
01:14:19,088 --> 01:14:20,914
You're kidding, right?

1104
01:14:21,382 --> 01:14:23,124
No.

1105
01:14:23,590 --> 01:14:25,084
That's bullshit, man.

1106
01:14:25,550 --> 01:14:26,712
Somebody should say something
to him.

1107
01:14:27,176 --> 01:14:28,338
What the fuck is he thinking?

1108
01:14:28,802 --> 01:14:31,207
Mitch is the only reason
you're not a corpse right now.

1109
01:14:31,678 --> 01:14:33,799
You know what?
I don't fucking give a shit.

1110
01:14:34,263 --> 01:14:36,005
I can take care of myself.

1111
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:40,005
He shouldn't be doing that.
I'm getting sick of it, man.

1112
01:14:40,473 --> 01:14:43,094
There's a lot of hard talk here
and no follow-through.

1113
01:14:45,768 --> 01:14:49,182
I think you better chill out
on the preaching bullshit.

1114
01:14:49,644 --> 01:14:52,395
We're getting a little tired
of that shit around here.

1115
01:14:53,814 --> 01:14:55,605
Ease up on it.

1116
01:15:25,663 --> 01:15:26,611
What are you doing here, Doris?

1117
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:28,822
I was in the neighborhood.

1118
01:15:29,290 --> 01:15:31,613
Look, I told you I don't want
you all coming up here.

1119
01:15:32,082 --> 01:15:34,834
I don't care
what you told me, OK?

1120
01:15:35,293 --> 01:15:36,490
I need to talk to you now.

1121
01:15:57,136 --> 01:15:58,131
So, how is everyone?

1122
01:15:58,595 --> 01:16:02,721
Davina's great. She's getting
straight As almost.

1123
01:16:03,180 --> 01:16:08,552
And Ally's walking,
starting to talk a little.

1124
01:16:13,602 --> 01:16:14,800
How's Danny?

1125
01:16:20,523 --> 01:16:23,012
He holds you up so high.

1126
01:16:23,482 --> 01:16:26,268
He thinks you're the greatest.

1127
01:16:26,734 --> 01:16:29,484
He's always bragging
about you to Cameron...

1128
01:16:29,943 --> 01:16:31,816
and all his new friends.

1129
01:16:35,488 --> 01:16:36,862
He's starting
to remind me of you.

1130
01:16:37,321 --> 01:16:39,859
Jesus, don't sound
so worried, all right?

1131
01:16:40,324 --> 01:16:43,940
I'm sure he's fine.
He's 16 years old, Doris.

1132
01:16:44,410 --> 01:16:45,653
He's not gonna be
a little angel forever.

1133
01:16:46,119 --> 01:16:48,075
You think because
I watched my firstborn...

1134
01:16:48,536 --> 01:16:50,859
fuck up his entire life
that I can sit here...

1135
01:16:51,330 --> 01:16:54,198
and see my baby follow
him down the same toilet?

1136
01:16:54,665 --> 01:16:56,074
I can't fix all this shit
from up here.

1137
01:16:56,540 --> 01:16:58,081
I'm not asking you to.

1138
01:16:58,541 --> 01:17:01,327
All it does is make me feel bad.
You're just making it harder.

1139
01:17:01,793 --> 01:17:05,041
You think you're the only one
doing time, Derek?

1140
01:17:05,502 --> 01:17:07,210
You think
you're here all alone?

1141
01:17:07,670 --> 01:17:09,497
You think I'm not in here
with you?

1142
01:17:22,219 --> 01:17:23,499
Fuck, man.

1143
01:17:26,388 --> 01:17:28,345
Every day I watch you
go through these sheets...

1144
01:17:28,806 --> 01:17:30,595
like you gonna get
to the end of them.

1145
01:17:32,015 --> 01:17:33,675
Look, nigger,
will you chill the fuck out?

1146
01:17:34,142 --> 01:17:34,972
Goddamn!

1147
01:17:35,434 --> 01:17:37,176
No matter how fast
you get through them...

1148
01:17:37,644 --> 01:17:39,931
they gonna keep bringing them in
and bringing them in.

1149
01:17:40,394 --> 01:17:41,639
Throwing them around
like that...

1150
01:17:42,105 --> 01:17:43,811
ain't gonna do a damn thing
but give you a heart attack!

1151
01:17:44,271 --> 01:17:45,516
And you know what?
That's cool with me!

1152
01:17:45,981 --> 01:17:48,471
But you gonna give me
a goddamn heart attack,too!

1153
01:17:57,027 --> 01:17:58,605
I know, I'm just a dumb,
stupid nigger, right?

1154
01:17:59,070 --> 01:18:00,647
What do I know?

1155
01:18:02,781 --> 01:18:05,899
I know I ain't the one getting
mad at them sheets,though.

1156
01:18:06,366 --> 01:18:08,986
As a matter of fact,
the only sheets I get mad at...

1157
01:18:09,451 --> 01:18:11,324
I'll tell you.

1158
01:18:12,994 --> 01:18:15,033
All right, boy,
this is what we gonna do.

1159
01:18:15,495 --> 01:18:16,905
We gonna hate some niggers.
That's what we'll do today.

1160
01:18:17,371 --> 01:18:18,781
We gonna hate
some goddamn niggers.

1161
01:18:19,248 --> 01:18:20,278
That's all we gonna do is
hate some niggers all day.

1162
01:18:20,747 --> 01:18:23,498
Don't know what a nigger is,
but we gonna hate them.

1163
01:18:23,957 --> 01:18:25,535
My cousin Derek
is in the pen right now...

1164
01:18:26,001 --> 01:18:30,327
workin' next to a nigger,
driving him nigger crazy.

1165
01:18:48,345 --> 01:18:50,667
See? That's the ticket.

1166
01:18:51,763 --> 01:18:53,090
Nice and easy.

1167
01:18:54,598 --> 01:18:56,423
Now we can ignore
each other in peace.

1168
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:02,591
"What are you doing?"
You know what he tells me?

1169
01:19:02,976 --> 01:19:05,727
"It's better than the pig
I just tried to fuck."

1170
01:19:08,605 --> 01:19:10,642
He never lets me
finish the joke.

1171
01:19:11,106 --> 01:19:12,481
You fuck him,too?

1172
01:19:14,482 --> 01:19:17,482
Whatever. She's laying on
her back, her legs are open...

1173
01:19:19,735 --> 01:19:23,682
What's up? How you doing?
There you go.

1174
01:19:34,826 --> 01:19:37,195
He was taking it
from the Mexicans...

1175
01:19:37,661 --> 01:19:39,320
and dealing it out
to his own people.

1176
01:19:39,786 --> 01:19:42,785
He didn't believe in shit.
None of them did.

1177
01:20:08,467 --> 01:20:11,218
What? Come on, man.

1178
01:20:11,677 --> 01:20:15,590
Don't look at me like that.
You know what that smells like.

1179
01:20:16,054 --> 01:20:18,425
Don't tell me this smell
don't remind you of a woman.

1180
01:20:20,723 --> 01:20:22,098
God, I miss that smell, man.

1181
01:20:23,349 --> 01:20:26,218
The job I had on the outside
wasn't much better than this...

1182
01:20:26,684 --> 01:20:28,427
but at least I got
to go home every night...

1183
01:20:28,894 --> 01:20:31,218
and lie down next to
that sweet smell, man.

1184
01:20:33,313 --> 01:20:36,845
God, I miss that.
You got a woman?

1185
01:20:38,065 --> 01:20:39,393
Yeah,you got a woman, man.

1186
01:20:39,857 --> 01:20:42,014
Let me give you some advice,
all right?

1187
01:20:42,484 --> 01:20:44,855
When she comes to visit you...

1188
01:20:45,318 --> 01:20:46,812
whatever you do,
no matter what...

1189
01:20:47,278 --> 01:20:48,771
don't let her leave here
in a fight, man.

1190
01:20:49,237 --> 01:20:50,861
Don't let her walk out
with a bad attitude...

1191
01:20:51,321 --> 01:20:53,608
'cause if you do,
you spend the next week...

1192
01:20:54,074 --> 01:20:56,313
wondering if she's getting her
fuck on with somebody else...

1193
01:20:56,781 --> 01:20:57,896
you know what I'm saying?

1194
01:20:58,366 --> 01:21:00,404
So when she come to see you,
it's nothing but sweet talk.

1195
01:21:00,869 --> 01:21:03,108
Send her away floating,
all right?

1196
01:21:03,576 --> 01:21:06,529
'Cause it's not like the real
world where you can fight...

1197
01:21:06,996 --> 01:21:09,745
'cause you can make up
and have that make-up sex.

1198
01:21:10,205 --> 01:21:11,580
Know what I'm saying?
That angry sex.

1199
01:21:12,039 --> 01:21:13,319
That sex with an attitude.

1200
01:21:13,790 --> 01:21:16,790
You lay on your back and let her
take out that aggression on you.

1201
01:21:17,251 --> 01:21:18,329
All guys know that, man.
That's that good sex.

1202
01:21:18,792 --> 01:21:21,199
That's that pow, pow, pow.

1203
01:21:21,670 --> 01:21:24,206
Let her get on top,
and she'll punish youfirst.

1204
01:21:24,671 --> 01:21:25,785
"You been a bad boy, huh?

1205
01:21:26,255 --> 01:21:28,827
"You been a bad boy,
and I'm gonna punish you.

1206
01:21:29,298 --> 01:21:30,411
"I'm gonna put it on you.

1207
01:21:30,882 --> 01:21:33,798
"Don't you ever...
let...me...catch...you...

1208
01:21:34,259 --> 01:21:37,211
"looking at...another...woman.
Yeah,yeah.

1209
01:21:37,677 --> 01:21:38,756
"I may forgive you
if you bring it.

1210
01:21:39,220 --> 01:21:41,377
"I think I can. l--l forgive.

1211
01:21:41,846 --> 01:21:44,549
"l forgive. Right there.
You're hitting it.

1212
01:21:45,013 --> 01:21:46,508
"My spot. That's it. Right.

1213
01:21:46,973 --> 01:21:50,340
"Yes. I for--l forgive you.
I forgive you.

1214
01:21:50,809 --> 01:21:52,930
"l for--l for--
I for--l forgive you!

1215
01:21:53,393 --> 01:21:55,550
"I love you!"

1216
01:22:13,862 --> 01:22:14,810
How do you figure the Lakers
to ever be a bigger dynasty...

1217
01:22:15,279 --> 01:22:16,771
than the Celtics?

1218
01:22:17,239 --> 01:22:19,147
The Lakers
are a flare-up, a fluke.

1219
01:22:19,615 --> 01:22:20,443
Are you crazy?

1220
01:22:20,907 --> 01:22:22,530
One good coach for four years.
The Celtics are a dynasty!

1221
01:22:22,990 --> 01:22:25,196
Come on, man.
The Celtics, right?

1222
01:22:25,659 --> 01:22:27,450
The ugliest team in
the history of sports.

1223
01:22:27,910 --> 01:22:29,652
A dynasty of
ugly motherfuckers, man.

1224
01:22:30,119 --> 01:22:31,910
Look at Kevin McHale.

1225
01:22:32,371 --> 01:22:34,658
James Worthy. That guy
has a head like a melon.

1226
01:22:35,121 --> 01:22:35,951
He had ladies.

1227
01:22:36,413 --> 01:22:38,821
I can't even talk to you.
I don't know what you're saying.

1228
01:22:39,291 --> 01:22:41,697
You are tweaking.
Boston Celtics.

1229
01:22:42,167 --> 01:22:43,791
-How many is that?
-That's enough.

1230
01:22:44,252 --> 01:22:45,450
Enough? All right.

1231
01:22:49,211 --> 01:22:50,540
You got that?

1232
01:22:55,174 --> 01:22:57,710
-I lost count, man.
-Doesn't matter, man.

1233
01:22:58,175 --> 01:23:00,796
Who's counting anyway?

1234
01:23:08,179 --> 01:23:10,170
All right,
so I wanna know something.

1235
01:23:11,222 --> 01:23:12,800
What the fuck
landed you in here?

1236
01:23:13,265 --> 01:23:15,056
You didn't kill anybody,
too skinny for a gangbanger.

1237
01:23:15,516 --> 01:23:17,722
Ain't that a bitch?
Don't judge a book by its cover.

1238
01:23:18,184 --> 01:23:19,299
I can throw these things.

1239
01:23:19,768 --> 01:23:22,175
Whatever. Come on.
What did you do?

1240
01:23:22,645 --> 01:23:24,719
None of your business.
It's embarrassing.

1241
01:23:25,188 --> 01:23:27,144
It's none of
your goddamn business.

1242
01:23:28,232 --> 01:23:30,721
Come on. Everybody in here
is embarrassed.

1243
01:23:31,191 --> 01:23:33,682
Nobody in here
got away with anything.

1244
01:23:34,776 --> 01:23:36,150
What'd you do?

1245
01:23:38,152 --> 01:23:40,310
Look, man, I stole a TV,
all right?

1246
01:23:40,779 --> 01:23:42,936
So you stole a TV.
What's embarrassing about that?

1247
01:23:43,405 --> 01:23:46,736
I stole a TV from a store
next to a doughnut shop.

1248
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:49,688
I ran out,the owner's
right behind me yelling.

1249
01:23:50,158 --> 01:23:51,817
Bam! I run into three cops.

1250
01:23:52,284 --> 01:23:55,201
I told you it was embarrassing.
You're laughing.

1251
01:23:55,661 --> 01:23:57,699
Wait a sec,wait a sec.

1252
01:23:58,162 --> 01:24:00,071
That don't make sense.

1253
01:24:01,331 --> 01:24:04,697
Nah,you didn't get six years
for stealing a TV. Come on.

1254
01:24:05,165 --> 01:24:08,331
I come out,the police officer
grabs my arm...

1255
01:24:08,792 --> 01:24:10,250
the TV falls on his foot
and breaks it.

1256
01:24:10,710 --> 01:24:15,037
They said I threw the TV at him.
Assault. Six years.

1257
01:24:15,504 --> 01:24:19,203
Come on. Tell the truth.
You chucked it at him.

1258
01:24:19,673 --> 01:24:22,209
Like I said,
I came out of the store...

1259
01:24:22,674 --> 01:24:26,172
he grabbed my arm,
it fell on his foot.

1260
01:24:31,178 --> 01:24:31,960
Come on now.

1261
01:24:32,430 --> 01:24:35,215
What you got for me, huh?

1262
01:24:36,263 --> 01:24:37,094
There you go, baby!

1263
01:24:37,556 --> 01:24:39,927
Yeah!
That's what I'm talking about.

1264
01:25:18,450 --> 01:25:19,317
Fuck you!

1265
01:25:19,785 --> 01:25:21,611
Give me a towel. Hold him.

1266
01:25:28,914 --> 01:25:30,325
You wanna be a nigger,
sweet boy?

1267
01:25:30,790 --> 01:25:32,829
-Fuck you!
-We gonna treat you like one.

1268
01:25:33,292 --> 01:25:36,409
-No.
-Come on.

1269
01:25:38,504 --> 01:25:40,079
Come on, give it to him!

1270
01:25:51,342 --> 01:25:52,919
Fuck you!

1271
01:25:57,012 --> 01:25:58,885
That was real sweet.

1272
01:25:59,347 --> 01:26:00,545
Fuck you!

1273
01:26:33,030 --> 01:26:34,488
How is he?

1274
01:26:35,281 --> 01:26:37,651
Well, he took six stitches.

1275
01:27:19,052 --> 01:27:21,588
Man,what the hell are you
doing here, anyway?

1276
01:27:22,053 --> 01:27:24,756
I came to talk about Danny, but
we don't have to do that now.

1277
01:27:25,222 --> 01:27:27,178
I brought you some books.

1278
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:32,556
What about him,you know?
Don't keep me in suspense.

1279
01:27:33,016 --> 01:27:35,008
He's headed right where you are.

1280
01:27:36,018 --> 01:27:39,136
You know what? My mother
already laid this trip on me.

1281
01:27:39,604 --> 01:27:41,844
Danny's not my responsibility.

1282
01:27:42,313 --> 01:27:43,557
What do you expect me
to do with that?

1283
01:27:44,022 --> 01:27:46,595
It doesn't help me.
Am I supposed to feel guilty?

1284
01:27:47,067 --> 01:27:48,309
I don'twant you to do anything.

1285
01:27:49,024 --> 01:27:50,566
I need to know the truth
about how you feel.

1286
01:27:51,025 --> 01:27:52,602
You think I want him in here?

1287
01:27:53,069 --> 01:27:55,190
I mean...I don't know.

1288
01:27:55,652 --> 01:27:57,111
I don't know what l feel.
I'm all...

1289
01:27:59,239 --> 01:28:00,946
l feel a little inside out.

1290
01:28:01,406 --> 01:28:02,947
I'm,you know--I don't know.

1291
01:28:03,407 --> 01:28:06,940
There's some things
that...that don't fit.

1292
01:28:07,409 --> 01:28:09,649
Well,that happens.

1293
01:28:10,702 --> 01:28:12,859
You are too damn smart
to be floating around here...

1294
01:28:13,329 --> 01:28:15,403
pretending you don't see
all the holes in this bullshit.

1295
01:28:15,870 --> 01:28:17,329
Hey, listen.
I said I was confused.

1296
01:28:17,788 --> 01:28:19,614
I didn't say
I didn't believe in it.

1297
01:28:20,083 --> 01:28:21,575
All right. That's why
you have to stay open.

1298
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:24,163
Right now,your anger
is consuming you here.

1299
01:28:24,625 --> 01:28:27,412
Your anger is shutting down
the brain God gave you.

1300
01:28:27,877 --> 01:28:29,453
God. You know, man?
You've been talking about...

1301
01:28:29,919 --> 01:28:31,294
what's going on with me
since I was in high school.

1302
01:28:31,754 --> 01:28:34,126
How the fuck do you know
what's going on inside me?

1303
01:28:34,589 --> 01:28:38,170
No, I know about me.
I know about this place.

1304
01:28:38,632 --> 01:28:40,127
I know about the place
you are in.

1305
01:28:40,592 --> 01:28:42,915
What do you know
about the place I'm in?

1306
01:28:43,384 --> 01:28:45,128
There was a moment...

1307
01:28:45,594 --> 01:28:48,131
when I used to blame
everything and everyone...

1308
01:28:48,595 --> 01:28:50,552
for all
the pain and suffering...

1309
01:28:51,013 --> 01:28:52,756
and vile things
that happened to me...

1310
01:28:53,223 --> 01:28:55,380
that I saw happen to my people.

1311
01:28:55,849 --> 01:28:57,259
Used to blame everybody.

1312
01:28:57,725 --> 01:29:00,678
Blamed white people,
blamed society, blamed God.

1313
01:29:01,143 --> 01:29:03,977
I didn't get no answers 'cause
I asked the wrong questions.

1314
01:29:04,436 --> 01:29:06,560
You have to ask
the right question.

1315
01:29:07,022 --> 01:29:08,219
Like what?

1316
01:29:10,773 --> 01:29:13,607
Has anything you've done
made your life better?

1317
01:29:33,993 --> 01:29:35,533
You gotta help me, man.

1318
01:29:38,287 --> 01:29:39,946
Just help me.

1319
01:29:41,955 --> 01:29:44,029
Get me out of here,you know?

1320
01:29:46,708 --> 01:29:49,375
I'm up in four months
for review.

1321
01:29:51,001 --> 01:29:52,494
Put in a word for me.

1322
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:55,248
I already have. So you're
out there, and then what?

1323
01:29:55,711 --> 01:29:58,083
I don't want to fuck up
my family anymore.

1324
01:29:58,547 --> 01:30:00,419
I'll go as far away
as I can get.

1325
01:30:00,881 --> 01:30:02,209
That's not good enough.

1326
01:30:02,673 --> 01:30:05,542
You want my help,
you gotta do better than that.

1327
01:30:06,008 --> 01:30:08,214
My help is not unconditional.

1328
01:30:08,676 --> 01:30:11,878
Running just ain't good enough.

1329
01:30:44,568 --> 01:30:47,438
Fuck him. Fuck him.

1330
01:30:47,904 --> 01:30:49,526
Fuck him.
Let the niggers have him.

1331
01:30:50,947 --> 01:30:51,895
What's up, D?

1332
01:30:52,365 --> 01:30:55,528
What's all that bullshit
you pulled in the mess hall?

1333
01:30:56,866 --> 01:30:59,272
You out of your fuckin' mind?
Are you fuckin' crazy?

1334
01:30:59,744 --> 01:31:01,486
D, look at me, man!

1335
01:31:01,952 --> 01:31:04,239
You can't make it in here
on your own.

1336
01:31:04,704 --> 01:31:06,494
I'm not afraid of
those fuckin' pussies.

1337
01:31:06,955 --> 01:31:08,448
There was six of them,
and they jumped me.

1338
01:31:08,914 --> 01:31:10,952
That won't happen again.
I hope they fuckin' try.

1339
01:31:11,415 --> 01:31:13,454
Man, I'm not talking
about your peckerwood friends!

1340
01:31:13,916 --> 01:31:15,872
They're protecting
your stupid ass!

1341
01:31:16,334 --> 01:31:19,702
You dissed them in public!
Now you're on your fuckin' own!

1342
01:31:20,170 --> 01:31:22,456
Yo, man, I'm talking about
the brothers, all right?

1343
01:31:22,921 --> 01:31:25,624
They'll fuck you,then
smoke your motherfucking ass!

1344
01:31:26,088 --> 01:31:28,460
Why don't you tell me
something I don't know?

1345
01:31:28,923 --> 01:31:30,465
You think I haven't
thought about that?

1346
01:31:30,925 --> 01:31:34,458
If they come for me,they come.
There ain't nothing I can do.

1347
01:31:35,802 --> 01:31:37,628
What can I do, man?

1348
01:31:42,513 --> 01:31:44,421
So I was right back
where I started.

1349
01:31:44,890 --> 01:31:46,928
Every day
I was sure it was my day.

1350
01:31:48,183 --> 01:31:50,755
Every time
I stepped out of my cell...

1351
01:31:51,226 --> 01:31:53,798
every time
I got in that shower...

1352
01:31:56,979 --> 01:31:58,438
l figured it was
only a matter of time...

1353
01:31:58,897 --> 01:32:00,853
before they made a move.

1354
01:32:02,023 --> 01:32:04,180
I just hoped it'd be quick.

1355
01:32:35,872 --> 01:32:38,161
But it never came.

1356
01:32:39,959 --> 01:32:40,788
I couldn't figure it out.

1357
01:32:41,251 --> 01:32:42,828
I knew some of them
were itching for it.

1358
01:32:43,293 --> 01:32:44,871
After a while,
I just put my head down...

1359
01:32:45,336 --> 01:32:46,711
and read the stuff
that Sweeney sent me...

1360
01:32:47,171 --> 01:32:48,793
and I kept to myself.

1361
01:32:50,964 --> 01:32:54,663
Last six months in that place,
I was like a ghost.

1362
01:33:08,472 --> 01:33:10,796
What's up, man?
You getting out?

1363
01:33:13,017 --> 01:33:14,390
Come on, man.
What the fuck you waiting on?

1364
01:33:14,850 --> 01:33:16,972
Get the fuck on outta here, man.

1365
01:33:18,810 --> 01:33:20,470
Yeah,you know,
I got this funny feeling.

1366
01:33:20,937 --> 01:33:22,892
Oh,yeah? What's that?

1367
01:33:24,271 --> 01:33:25,469
I'm thinking maybe
the only reason...

1368
01:33:25,939 --> 01:33:27,977
I'm getting out of here
in one piece is you.

1369
01:33:29,399 --> 01:33:30,394
Come on, man!
Get the fuck outta here!

1370
01:33:30,857 --> 01:33:32,351
You think I'm gonna
put my neck on the line...

1371
01:33:32,818 --> 01:33:34,477
for some crazy ass peckerwood?

1372
01:33:34,943 --> 01:33:36,401
Yeah. Right.

1373
01:33:36,861 --> 01:33:39,018
Stupid.

1374
01:33:44,824 --> 01:33:46,365
That's what I thought.

1375
01:33:50,826 --> 01:33:52,485
I owe you, man.

1376
01:33:52,952 --> 01:33:55,109
Man,you don't owe me shit,
all right?

1377
01:33:58,122 --> 01:33:59,320
Yes, I do.

1378
01:34:09,377 --> 01:34:10,954
You'll be outta here in no time.

1379
01:34:11,420 --> 01:34:13,874
Man,
it's a piece of cake, all right?

1380
01:34:15,964 --> 01:34:17,337
Just take it easy
on the brothers, all right?

1381
01:34:17,798 --> 01:34:19,042
The brothers!

1382
01:34:29,387 --> 01:34:30,714
God, man.

1383
01:34:33,347 --> 01:34:35,089
Sorry, Derek.

1384
01:34:36,182 --> 01:34:38,339
Sorry that happened to you.

1385
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:42,303
Well, I'm not. I'm lucky.

1386
01:34:42,768 --> 01:34:45,767
l feel lucky,
'cause it's wrong, Dan.

1387
01:34:47,978 --> 01:34:49,354
It's wrong,
and it was eating me up.

1388
01:34:49,813 --> 01:34:51,355
It was gonna kill me.

1389
01:34:51,814 --> 01:34:53,392
And I kept asking myself
all the time...

1390
01:34:53,857 --> 01:34:57,769
how did I buy into this shit,
you know?

1391
01:34:59,568 --> 01:35:01,393
It's just 'cause
I was pissed off.

1392
01:35:02,611 --> 01:35:05,693
Nothing I ever did
ever took that feeling away.

1393
01:35:07,447 --> 01:35:10,280
I killed two guys, Danny.
I killed them.

1394
01:35:12,199 --> 01:35:14,356
And it didn't make me
feel any different.

1395
01:35:15,617 --> 01:35:16,447
Just got me more lost...

1396
01:35:16,909 --> 01:35:18,985
and I'm tired of feeling
pissed-off, Danny.

1397
01:35:19,453 --> 01:35:21,942
I'm just tired of it.

1398
01:35:22,412 --> 01:35:24,700
And I'm not telling you
what to do.

1399
01:35:26,123 --> 01:35:27,616
I'm really not.

1400
01:35:28,540 --> 01:35:30,698
But I need you to understand...

1401
01:35:32,584 --> 01:35:35,701
'cause I love you,
and you're my best friend.

1402
01:35:37,921 --> 01:35:39,378
Do you understand?

1403
01:35:39,839 --> 01:35:41,711
Yeah, I understand.

1404
01:35:45,341 --> 01:35:46,715
All right.

1405
01:35:50,718 --> 01:35:52,093
Jesus.

1406
01:36:08,851 --> 01:36:10,310
Hi. Everything OK?

1407
01:36:10,770 --> 01:36:11,764
Ah, everything's great.

1408
01:36:12,229 --> 01:36:14,552
Great. Yeah.
You wanna sleep in our room?

1409
01:36:15,021 --> 01:36:16,515
-No. Thank you.
-You sure?

1410
01:36:16,981 --> 01:36:19,934
Yeah. This is good.
Thank you.

1411
01:36:20,399 --> 01:36:22,687
All right. Come on, let's go.

1412
01:36:43,952 --> 01:36:45,150
Good night.

1413
01:37:51,902 --> 01:37:53,609
I'm gonna take a shower,
all right?

1414
01:38:27,961 --> 01:38:28,874
It's hard to look back...

1415
01:38:29,336 --> 01:38:31,791
and see the truth
about people you love.

1416
01:38:32,256 --> 01:38:34,745
I think if you asked Derek why
it all went the way it did...

1417
01:38:35,214 --> 01:38:36,377
and where it all started...

1418
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:39,592
he'd still say it started
when our father was murdered.

1419
01:38:40,843 --> 01:38:42,751
The truth is,
it started earlier.

1420
01:38:43,219 --> 01:38:46,005
Are we all meeting
for the game tonight?

1421
01:38:46,470 --> 01:38:47,252
Definitely.

1422
01:38:47,720 --> 01:38:48,965
All right,
Ben's Burger at 7:00...

1423
01:38:49,430 --> 01:38:50,628
then we go watch
the big guy play.

1424
01:38:53,223 --> 01:38:54,765
Psyching up for the game?

1425
01:38:55,224 --> 01:38:57,975
I'm always ready for that.
I got an English exam.

1426
01:38:58,434 --> 01:39:00,142
I'm having a heart attack.
I'm not ready.

1427
01:39:00,602 --> 01:39:02,226
What's the matter?
Afraid you'll get a "B"?

1428
01:39:02,687 --> 01:39:05,176
Might do you good. B-minus.

1429
01:39:05,647 --> 01:39:08,183
Hey, don't laugh.
This guy is different.

1430
01:39:08,647 --> 01:39:10,770
Dr. Sweeney.
This guy's unbelievable.

1431
01:39:11,233 --> 01:39:12,809
Unbelievable. I've never
had a teacher like this.

1432
01:39:13,276 --> 01:39:14,306
He's got two Ph.D.s.

1433
01:39:14,775 --> 01:39:17,692
I don't know what he's doing
teaching at our school.

1434
01:39:18,153 --> 01:39:19,018
What's he got you reading?

1435
01:39:19,487 --> 01:39:22,651
We got this essay exam
on "Native Son."

1436
01:39:23,113 --> 01:39:25,235
"Native Son"?
I don't know that.

1437
01:39:25,698 --> 01:39:27,108
That's a big surprise.

1438
01:39:28,240 --> 01:39:29,699
What? I read.

1439
01:39:30,784 --> 01:39:34,151
Honey,they don't teach
Tom Clancy in school.

1440
01:39:35,828 --> 01:39:37,156
Well,they don't.

1441
01:39:37,621 --> 01:39:39,162
So what is this "Native Son"?

1442
01:39:40,413 --> 01:39:42,204
It's this book
about this black guy.

1443
01:39:42,665 --> 01:39:45,200
We're doing this whole
black literature unit.

1444
01:39:45,667 --> 01:39:47,787
Is it Black History Month?

1445
01:39:48,249 --> 01:39:50,158
No, it's just
this guy Sweeney,you know?

1446
01:39:50,627 --> 01:39:52,535
It's part of the course now.

1447
01:39:59,173 --> 01:40:00,287
What?

1448
01:40:00,756 --> 01:40:03,127
Nothing. It's just...

1449
01:40:03,590 --> 01:40:05,300
It's everywhere I look now.

1450
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:07,549
What?

1451
01:40:09,177 --> 01:40:11,501
This affirmative blacktion.

1452
01:40:11,971 --> 01:40:16,843
A few new books doesn't qualify
as affirmative black action.

1453
01:40:18,015 --> 01:40:19,426
Read the book,
ace the guy's test.

1454
01:40:19,891 --> 01:40:21,929
Just don't swallow
everything he feeds you whole.

1455
01:40:22,392 --> 01:40:23,387
Just 'cause you see it
on the evening news...

1456
01:40:23,851 --> 01:40:24,681
I know, but what?

1457
01:40:25,143 --> 01:40:26,685
All this stuff about
making everything equal.

1458
01:40:27,144 --> 01:40:28,139
It's not that simple.

1459
01:40:28,604 --> 01:40:30,096
Now you got this book
"Native Son."

1460
01:40:30,563 --> 01:40:32,140
What happened to
the other books in the course?

1461
01:40:32,606 --> 01:40:36,683
They're not any good anymore
because Mr. Two Ph.D. says so?

1462
01:40:37,150 --> 01:40:39,141
Now you gotta trade in
great books for black books?

1463
01:40:39,610 --> 01:40:41,897
Does that make sense?

1464
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:44,103
You gotta question
these things, Derek.

1465
01:40:44,569 --> 01:40:46,147
You gotta look
at the whole picture.

1466
01:40:46,612 --> 01:40:49,232
We're talking about books here.
I'm also talking about my job.

1467
01:40:49,697 --> 01:40:52,104
I got two black guys
on my squad now...

1468
01:40:52,574 --> 01:40:54,730
who got their job
over a couple of white guys...

1469
01:40:55,200 --> 01:40:56,823
who actually scored higher
on the test.

1470
01:40:57,285 --> 01:41:00,070
Does that make sense?

1471
01:41:00,535 --> 01:41:03,820
Everything's equal now, but I
got two guys watching my back...

1472
01:41:04,288 --> 01:41:07,868
responsible for my life
who aren't as good.

1473
01:41:08,331 --> 01:41:09,705
They only got the job
because they were black...

1474
01:41:10,165 --> 01:41:12,122
not because they were the best.

1475
01:41:12,584 --> 01:41:15,203
-That sucks.
-Is that what America's about?

1476
01:41:15,669 --> 01:41:17,078
No,America's about
best man for the job.

1477
01:41:17,545 --> 01:41:19,287
You do your best,
you get the job.

1478
01:41:19,754 --> 01:41:22,326
This affirmative-action crap...

1479
01:41:22,796 --> 01:41:24,077
I don't know what that's about.

1480
01:41:24,547 --> 01:41:28,293
There's like some hidden agenda
or something going on.

1481
01:41:28,758 --> 01:41:29,871
You see what I'm saying?

1482
01:41:30,343 --> 01:41:32,832
Yeah, I do. I didn't
think about it like that.

1483
01:41:34,510 --> 01:41:36,052
This guy,though--I don't know.

1484
01:41:36,511 --> 01:41:38,219
Dr. Sweeney,
he comes on so strong...

1485
01:41:38,680 --> 01:41:40,090
it's hard
not to listen to him...

1486
01:41:40,555 --> 01:41:42,760
but maybe some of
what he says is kinda...

1487
01:41:43,223 --> 01:41:44,421
It's bullshit.

1488
01:41:45,559 --> 01:41:47,300
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

1489
01:41:47,767 --> 01:41:51,514
No. It's nigger bullshit.

1490
01:41:53,936 --> 01:41:56,224
-You see that, don't you?
-Yeah.

1491
01:41:56,688 --> 01:41:58,098
You gotta watch out for that.

1492
01:41:58,564 --> 01:42:01,598
Yeah. No, I get what
you're saying. I will.

1493
01:42:03,107 --> 01:42:04,731
Good boy.

1494
01:42:05,193 --> 01:42:06,899
I'm proud of you.

1495
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:08,902
Don't worry about it. I got it.

1496
01:44:14,463 --> 01:44:15,957
And in about one minute...

1497
01:44:16,422 --> 01:44:18,664
I'm gonna watch the sun come up.

1498
01:44:19,133 --> 01:44:21,373
I don't know
if I've ever done that.

1499
01:44:22,634 --> 01:44:25,385
Anyway,we're gonna try to pick
things up and start over.

1500
01:44:25,845 --> 01:44:28,963
It won't be easy,
but we're all together again...

1501
01:44:29,429 --> 01:44:31,467
and l feel good.

1502
01:44:32,431 --> 01:44:34,968
I'm not sure if this paper
is what you wanted--

1503
01:44:35,432 --> 01:44:36,973
if I hit
the social significance...

1504
01:44:37,433 --> 01:44:39,260
or whatever
you're looking for...

1505
01:44:39,726 --> 01:44:43,307
but for what it's worth,
thanks a lot.

1506
01:44:57,735 --> 01:45:01,980
Wow. You look great.
Look at you.

1507
01:45:03,613 --> 01:45:06,233
Yeah. Gotta dress up
for the parole officer.

1508
01:45:06,697 --> 01:45:07,609
Is she cute?

1509
01:45:08,073 --> 01:45:09,816
She is a fat guy named Hector...

1510
01:45:10,283 --> 01:45:13,531
-Oh. Well...
-So I'm out of luck.

1511
01:45:15,743 --> 01:45:16,906
I just gotta check in...

1512
01:45:17,369 --> 01:45:19,112
then I'm gonna see about
getting my old job back.

1513
01:45:19,579 --> 01:45:22,364
-Great.
-Good morning.

1514
01:45:23,664 --> 01:45:24,577
Davina, can you help?

1515
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:26,368
Your sister's gonna help you.

1516
01:45:27,415 --> 01:45:28,791
You look great. Knock 'em dead.

1517
01:45:29,250 --> 01:45:30,364
Thanks.

1518
01:45:30,834 --> 01:45:33,288
Come on, sweetie. What would
you like to wear today?

1519
01:45:35,878 --> 01:45:38,713
-You do look good.
-Yeah? l feel silly.

1520
01:45:39,172 --> 01:45:41,328
-You look good.
-Yeah?

1521
01:45:43,382 --> 01:45:44,959
You feel good?

1522
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:50,551
Yeah. l feel,you know...

1523
01:45:51,010 --> 01:45:52,504
a little...

1524
01:45:52,970 --> 01:45:55,424
I'm getting there.

1525
01:45:56,972 --> 01:45:58,845
Listen...I don't know--

1526
01:46:00,432 --> 01:46:02,719
I don't know
if it's OK that I'm here.

1527
01:46:07,018 --> 01:46:08,216
I want to be here.

1528
01:46:26,945 --> 01:46:28,604
-I'm gonna get a paper.
-Cool.

1529
01:46:46,121 --> 01:46:48,871
-What do you want?
-Maple bar and a large milk.

1530
01:46:49,330 --> 01:46:50,706
All right. I got it.

1531
01:46:55,292 --> 01:46:56,916
Let me get a coffee...

1532
01:46:57,376 --> 01:46:59,452
a maple bar,
and a large milk to go.

1533
01:46:59,919 --> 01:47:01,163
Right away.

1534
01:47:11,132 --> 01:47:13,504
Derek,we need to talk.

1535
01:47:13,967 --> 01:47:14,880
What's going on?

1536
01:47:15,344 --> 01:47:19,505
Cameron Alexander and Seth Ryan
are at the ICU at St. John's.

1537
01:47:19,970 --> 01:47:20,884
They were jumped last night
near Ben's Burgers.

1538
01:47:21,347 --> 01:47:22,803
How bad?

1539
01:47:23,265 --> 01:47:24,509
Well, it looks
like they're gonna live.

1540
01:47:24,974 --> 01:47:28,056
-Then they got lucky.
-Somebody's gotta lose,though.

1541
01:47:30,601 --> 01:47:31,799
What?

1542
01:47:33,185 --> 01:47:35,888
We were kinda hoping maybe
you'd talk to your old crew--

1543
01:47:36,354 --> 01:47:37,467
Come on. No way.

1544
01:47:37,939 --> 01:47:40,640
If there's anybody they're
gonna listen to, it's you.

1545
01:47:41,105 --> 01:47:42,979
No. I hate to tell you,
but I'm out, OK?

1546
01:47:43,441 --> 01:47:44,982
Those guys are probably
gunning for me now.

1547
01:47:45,441 --> 01:47:46,851
We're asking
for your help here, Derek.

1548
01:47:47,317 --> 01:47:49,308
Did you tell him
I was gonna do this?

1549
01:47:56,156 --> 01:47:57,898
This has got nothing
to do with me anymore.

1550
01:47:58,365 --> 01:48:00,818
Yes, it does. It has
everything to do with you.

1551
01:48:01,282 --> 01:48:03,654
God,what are you doing to me?
I'm doing my best!

1552
01:48:04,117 --> 01:48:06,441
I'm going like this just to keep
my family in the clear.

1553
01:48:06,910 --> 01:48:07,990
Don't ask me to fix
this fuckin' situation!

1554
01:48:08,453 --> 01:48:09,994
-I'm not asking that.
-It was there before me.

1555
01:48:10,453 --> 01:48:12,825
You helped create it.
You wanna take a break now?

1556
01:48:13,288 --> 01:48:14,746
You take a break,
you'll find no peace.

1557
01:48:15,206 --> 01:48:17,874
The way to find peace
is to stick.

1558
01:48:18,333 --> 01:48:19,826
It's not gonna make
a fuckin' bit of difference.

1559
01:48:20,291 --> 01:48:23,078
-It might.
-Not a bit.

1560
01:48:23,543 --> 01:48:26,875
I mean, do you know
what you're asking me to do?

1561
01:48:27,336 --> 01:48:30,170
Yes. I'm asking you to do
whatever's in your power to do.

1562
01:48:31,715 --> 01:48:33,954
Oh, man.

1563
01:48:36,717 --> 01:48:38,044
Fuck.

1564
01:48:42,636 --> 01:48:44,046
All right.

1565
01:48:45,888 --> 01:48:48,424
You know what you're gonna do?
Get me shot by white boys.

1566
01:48:48,889 --> 01:48:50,430
I doubt it.

1567
01:48:50,889 --> 01:48:53,924
We're all gonna have a laugh
at that, let me tell ya.

1568
01:48:55,183 --> 01:48:58,054
I'm gonna take him to school.
I'll be back in half an hour.

1569
01:48:58,519 --> 01:48:59,597
Come on.

1570
01:49:00,060 --> 01:49:03,393
Hey,you. You got something
good for me this morning?

1571
01:49:03,854 --> 01:49:04,804
I'll give it to you,
Dr. Sweeney.

1572
01:49:05,273 --> 01:49:06,469
-Yeah, OK.
-All right.

1573
01:49:11,359 --> 01:49:13,314
What's goin' on?

1574
01:49:18,279 --> 01:49:19,441
Come on, let's go.

1575
01:49:35,245 --> 01:49:37,783
It's just so bad for Seth, man.

1576
01:49:38,247 --> 01:49:40,996
I wonder how bad
they got fucked up.

1577
01:49:42,415 --> 01:49:44,621
I'm glad they're not dead.
Other than that, I don't care.

1578
01:49:46,292 --> 01:49:47,204
Should we visit them?

1579
01:49:47,668 --> 01:49:49,790
No. Definitely not.

1580
01:49:50,252 --> 01:49:51,830
Just stay out of it.

1581
01:49:52,295 --> 01:49:55,792
Listen. I saw a car cruising
by the house last night...

1582
01:49:56,256 --> 01:49:57,797
when I pulled
out of there with Seth.

1583
01:49:58,256 --> 01:50:00,792
If you get home before me today,
give a look around the street.

1584
01:50:01,257 --> 01:50:03,794
Make sure
there's nothing going on.

1585
01:50:04,843 --> 01:50:06,881
Man,this is bad.

1586
01:50:09,262 --> 01:50:11,716
-They're after you, man.
-It'll cool off.

1587
01:50:12,179 --> 01:50:15,629
If I made it through Chino,
this should be a piece of cake.

1588
01:50:17,975 --> 01:50:19,172
You gonna be OK?

1589
01:50:24,144 --> 01:50:24,926
What are you gonna do?

1590
01:50:25,395 --> 01:50:28,347
I'll work it out.
Keep your head up, all right?

1591
01:50:28,812 --> 01:50:31,848
Things are gonna be fine.
It's gonna be fine.

1592
01:50:32,315 --> 01:50:34,057
Go turn that paper in.

1593
01:50:35,816 --> 01:50:38,602
All right. See ya.

1594
01:50:39,068 --> 01:50:40,265
Come here.

1595
01:50:46,280 --> 01:50:47,477
I'll see you at home.

1596
01:50:49,282 --> 01:50:50,905
All right?

1597
01:50:52,241 --> 01:50:54,316
Yeah, I'll see you.
Good luck, all right?

1598
01:50:54,784 --> 01:50:57,737
-Yeah.
-See you later.

1599
01:51:03,497 --> 01:51:06,068
-Gonna be late.
-We better go.

1600
01:51:07,081 --> 01:51:08,326
All right. Come on.

1601
01:51:31,385 --> 01:51:32,167
Bye.

1602
01:51:32,635 --> 01:51:35,551
I'll catch up with you.
See you later.

1603
01:52:57,260 --> 01:52:58,884
Get out of my way!

1604
01:52:59,344 --> 01:53:01,003
All right! Let him go!

1605
01:53:03,430 --> 01:53:04,628
Oh, no.

1606
01:53:07,807 --> 01:53:09,845
Aw,Jesus.

1607
01:53:33,361 --> 01:53:34,606
Oh,Jesus.

1608
01:53:35,070 --> 01:53:37,062
God,what did I do?

1609
01:54:05,752 --> 01:54:09,119
So I guess this is where
I tell you what I learned.

1610
01:54:09,212 --> 01:54:11,204
My conclusion, right?

1611
01:54:12,171 --> 01:54:15,919
Well, my conclusion is
hate is baggage.

1612
01:54:16,758 --> 01:54:20,088
Life's too short
to be pissed off all the time.

1613
01:54:20,550 --> 01:54:22,424
It's just not worth it.

1614
01:54:25,137 --> 01:54:28,800
Derek says it's always good
to end a paper with a quote.

1615
01:54:29,263 --> 01:54:31,136
He says someone else
has already said it best...

1616
01:54:31,598 --> 01:54:33,091
so if you can't top it...

1617
01:54:33,556 --> 01:54:35,633
steal from them
and go out strong.

1618
01:54:36,100 --> 01:54:38,424
So I picked a guy
I thought you'd like.

1619
01:54:39,768 --> 01:54:43,515
"We are not enemies,
but friends.

1620
01:54:43,979 --> 01:54:45,851
"We must not be enemies.

1621
01:54:46,313 --> 01:54:48,221
"Though passion
may have strained...

1622
01:54:48,689 --> 01:54:50,931
"we must not break
our bonds of affection.

1623
01:54:51,399 --> 01:54:53,686
"The mystic chords of memory...

1624
01:54:54,150 --> 01:54:56,272
"will swell
when again touched...

1625
01:54:56,735 --> 01:54:58,277
"as surely they will be...

1626
01:54:58,736 --> 01:55:01,604
"by the better angels
of our nature."
