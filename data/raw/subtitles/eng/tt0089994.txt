00:00:11,928 --> 00:00:13,430
Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,932
Would you please rise for the
Grouch Anthem?

3
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:17,434
No, no, no.

4
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:20,937
With the Grouch Anthem,
you stay sitting down.

5
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:22,439
Down in front, man.

6
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:23,940
Now, brace yourself.

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,942
I'm gonna sing.

8
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:27,944

♫ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♫

25
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:23,500
You know what's right with this world?
Nothing.

26
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,002
You know what really makes me
hot under the collar?

27
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,003
You name it.

28
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:30,006
And the next time some
goody-two-shoes smiles

29
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:32,008
and tells you to "Have a nice day,"

30
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,511

♫ Just stand up

36
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:55,532
♫ And complain ♫

37
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:02,539
Well, anyway,

38
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,541
you've seen the best part of
this movie,

39
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,543
so sit back, relax,

40
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:09,546
and have a rotten time.
Heh heh heh.

41
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:25,228
Sesame Street is brought to
you today

42
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:28,731
By the letters "W" and "B."

43
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:35,738
Your attention, please.

44
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,241
Attention.

45
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,744
Attention, please.

46
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:42,745
Featherbeds are down.

47
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:43,746
I can't believe it.

48
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,249
Attention.

49
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,751
Attention, please.

50
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:54,757
Attention!

51
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:59,262
This meeting of the feathered friends

52
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:02,765
Will now come to order.

53
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:07,770
Now, I need not remind you of
our purpose.

54
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,272
Remind me!

55
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:15,278
To place stray birds with nice
bird families.

56
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,284
Now, here today we have a sad,
sad case

57
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:24,787
That needs our urgent attention.

58
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:27,790
He's only 6 years old,

59
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,792
and he lives all alone

60
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:33,796
With no other birds around.

61
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:38,801
He looks so sad.

62
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:41,304
That's funny.
He looks happy to me.

63
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,806
Of course he's not happy!

64
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,308
How can you say that?

65
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,809
Look at him.

66
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,811
Look at his face.

67
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:51,814
If you think he's happy,
then you don't belong!

68
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:54,317
Madam Chairbird!

69
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,319
Miss Finch.

70
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,321
Ahem.

71
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:01,324
We all know he can't be happy.

72
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:05,328
He needs to be with his own kind.

73
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,330
With a bird family.

74
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,832
True, very true.

75
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,335
And I know just the family.

76
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:13,336
Where does he live?

77
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:16,339
Sesame Street.

78
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:20,843
Can you tell me how to get to...

79
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,845
Sesame Street?

80
00:04:46,402 --> 00:04:47,904
Hi, Willy!

81
00:04:47,904 --> 00:04:49,906
Morning, Big Bird!

82
00:04:50,406 --> 00:04:54,410
♫ La la la la ♫

83
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,913
Today we're playing
Trash-In-The-Barrel.

84
00:04:56,913 --> 00:04:59,916
Bring me all the trash you can carry.

85
00:05:04,087 --> 00:05:06,589
Ah... A bird.

86
00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:08,091
Hi, little fella.

87
00:05:10,093 --> 00:05:12,095
Oh, where did you fly in from?

88
00:05:14,097 --> 00:05:16,099
Are you gonna settle here?

89
00:05:16,099 --> 00:05:17,600
♫
♫

90
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,603
Oh. You're only passing through.

91
00:05:20,603 --> 00:05:24,607
Well, you're welcome to stay
here as long as you want.

92
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:27,610
♫
♫

93
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:32,115
Oscar's going to just love
these cans.

94
00:05:32,115 --> 00:05:33,116
Whoa!

95
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:38,621
Oh, wait, wait!
Please don't fly away!

96
00:05:38,621 --> 00:05:39,622
Please don't go.

97
00:05:39,622 --> 00:05:42,125
Wait.
I hardly ever get to talk to birds.

98
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,127
Hey, wait!
Wait! Wait!

99
00:05:44,627 --> 00:05:47,130
Aah!

100
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,131
Heh heh heh.

101
00:05:48,131 --> 00:05:50,133
Nice work, turkey.

102
00:05:52,135 --> 00:05:53,636
Ugh.

103
00:05:53,636 --> 00:05:56,639
Are you all right, Big?

104
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,142
You are Big Bird?

105
00:05:59,142 --> 00:06:03,146
Yeah, I guess I am.

106
00:06:03,146 --> 00:06:05,648
This is worse than I thought.

107
00:06:05,648 --> 00:06:09,152
Big, I'm Miss Finch of
The Feathered Friends.

108
00:06:09,152 --> 00:06:13,156
Oh.
Any feathered friend is a friend of mine.

109
00:06:13,156 --> 00:06:14,657
I want to talk to you.

110
00:06:14,657 --> 00:06:16,159
You do?

111
00:06:16,159 --> 00:06:18,661
Well, let's step into my nest.

112
00:06:20,663 --> 00:06:23,166
Oh, dear.

113
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,667
Tsk tsk tsk tsk.

114
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:26,169
You know, Big,

115
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:30,173
You shouldn't be living here
all alone.

116
00:06:30,173 --> 00:06:32,675
Well, I'm not all alone.

117
00:06:32,675 --> 00:06:34,677
There's Gordon and Susan..

118
00:06:35,178 --> 00:06:37,680
Mmm, but they're not birds
like we are.

119
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,683
I know, but they're nice people.

120
00:06:40,683 --> 00:06:45,188
But you should have a home and
a family.

121
00:06:45,188 --> 00:06:47,190
Well, I am home.

122
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,692
I like it here on Sesame Street.

123
00:06:49,692 --> 00:06:52,695
Wouldn't you like to be with
your own kind?

124
00:06:52,695 --> 00:06:54,197
Wouldn't you like to live

125
00:06:54,197 --> 00:06:57,200
In a big, beautiful birdhouse

126
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,702
with a nice bird family?

127
00:06:59,702 --> 00:07:01,204
Your own.

128
00:07:01,204 --> 00:07:04,207
And a brother bird and a sister bird

129
00:07:04,207 --> 00:07:07,710
and a father bird and a mother bird?

130
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:12,215
and sing and play bird games
all day long?

131
00:07:12,215 --> 00:07:14,217
Wouldn't you?

132
00:07:15,218 --> 00:07:16,219
Wouldn't you?

133
00:07:43,746 --> 00:07:46,249
Gee, I think I'd like that.

134
00:07:46,749 --> 00:07:47,250
Good.

135
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,252
Because in a lovely city

136
00:07:49,252 --> 00:07:50,753
called Oceanview, Illinois,

137
00:07:50,753 --> 00:07:54,257
There's a fine feathered family
waiting just for you.

138
00:07:54,757 --> 00:07:56,259
Really?

139
00:07:56,259 --> 00:07:57,760
Oh, when can I leave?

140
00:07:58,261 --> 00:07:59,262
I can't wait!

141
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,765
But... What will I tell my friends?

142
00:08:06,769 --> 00:08:10,773
Oh, Bird, this is goodbye.

143
00:08:10,773 --> 00:08:13,776
You're leaving Sesame Street.

144
00:08:13,776 --> 00:08:16,279
Well, I'm not really leaving.

145
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:18,281
I'm just going away.

146
00:08:18,281 --> 00:08:19,282
Oh.

147
00:08:19,282 --> 00:08:20,283
Besides,

148
00:08:20,783 --> 00:08:22,285
as soon as I get to Oceanview,

149
00:08:22,285 --> 00:08:23,786
you can come and visit.

150
00:08:23,786 --> 00:08:26,289
I can?

151
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:27,790
First thing, old pal.

152
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:28,791
I wouldn't go

153
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,293
if you couldn't come and visit.

154
00:08:30,293 --> 00:08:33,296
Oh, Bird.

155
00:08:33,296 --> 00:08:34,297
Hey, Snuffy?

156
00:08:34,297 --> 00:08:35,298
Huh?

157
00:08:35,298 --> 00:08:36,799
Will you do me a favor?

158
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:42,305
Oh, Bird,
I would do anything for you.

159
00:08:42,305 --> 00:08:45,308
You're my best friend.

160
00:08:45,808 --> 00:08:48,311
Well, will you watch my nest

161
00:08:48,311 --> 00:08:50,813
and all my things while I'm away,

162
00:08:50,813 --> 00:08:54,317
so nothing happens to them?

163
00:08:54,317 --> 00:08:57,320
Sure thing, Bird.

164
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,823
Oh, snuffy, I guess this is goodbye.

165
00:09:00,823 --> 00:09:06,329
Oh, Bird, I hate to see you go.

166
00:09:06,329 --> 00:09:07,330
Oh, Snuff.

167
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:08,331
Oh.

Hi, Olivia.
Hi, Susan.

176
00:09:35,858 --> 00:09:39,362
Oh... You're all here to
say good-bye.

177
00:09:39,362 --> 00:09:40,863
Big Bird is leaving?

178
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:43,366
But where is Big Bird going?

179
00:09:43,366 --> 00:09:45,368
Big Bird...

180
00:09:45,368 --> 00:09:47,370
Are you sure you want to go?

181
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,372
You don't have to, you know.

182
00:09:49,372 --> 00:09:50,373
No, you don't.

183
00:09:50,373 --> 00:09:52,375
I know. But you know,

184
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:56,379
I will be getting my very own
bird family.

185
00:09:56,379 --> 00:09:59,882
But big bird, we're your family.

186
00:09:59,882 --> 00:10:01,384
You know that.

187
00:10:01,384 --> 00:10:03,386
I'd like to give it a try.

188
00:10:03,386 --> 00:10:04,887
Of course he would.

189
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:10,393
Well, Big Bird...

190
00:10:10,393 --> 00:10:11,894
If that's really what you want..

191
00:10:12,395 --> 00:10:12,895
Come on, Big Bird.

192
00:10:13,396 --> 00:10:14,397
You don't want to miss your plane.

193
00:10:14,397 --> 00:10:15,898
Just a minute.

194
00:10:15,898 --> 00:10:18,401
Give us a big hug, Big Bird.

195
00:10:23,906 --> 00:10:24,907
Don't forget to write.

196
00:10:24,907 --> 00:10:26,409
I won't, Maria.

197
00:10:26,409 --> 00:10:27,910
Don't forget to count!

198
00:10:28,411 --> 00:10:29,912
Ok, count!

199
00:10:29,912 --> 00:10:31,914
And don't forget to dress warmly,
ok, Big Bird?

200
00:10:31,914 --> 00:10:33,416
I got my muffler, Bob.

201
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:36,419
Don't forget to breathe in and out!

202
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:37,920
I always do, Grover.

203
00:10:41,924 --> 00:10:43,426
I'll read every day.

204
00:10:43,426 --> 00:10:45,428
Oh, Bird, don't forget to eat.

205
00:10:45,428 --> 00:10:47,430
I won't, Cookie Monster.

206
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,932
Well...

207
00:10:49,932 --> 00:10:51,434
Goodbye, Oscar.

208
00:10:51,434 --> 00:10:55,438
Why.. why, that's the nicest thing

209
00:10:55,438 --> 00:10:58,441
you've ever said to me.

210
00:10:58,441 --> 00:11:00,943
Big, it's time.

211
00:11:00,943 --> 00:11:02,945
But can't we just, uh...

212
00:11:03,446 --> 00:11:06,449
Just keep walking and don't
look back.

213
00:11:06,449 --> 00:11:07,450
Why?

214
00:11:09,952 --> 00:11:11,454
Oh!

215
00:11:12,955 --> 00:11:13,956
What the...

216
00:11:13,956 --> 00:11:16,459
I told you not to look back.

217
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:17,460
Oh!

218
00:11:23,466 --> 00:11:24,467
Bye, Big Bird.

219
00:11:24,467 --> 00:11:25,968
Take care, Big Bird.

220
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,472
Bye, Big Bird.

221
00:11:29,472 --> 00:11:30,473
Bye, Tanya.

222
00:11:35,978 --> 00:11:38,981
Don't forget, Big Bird,
we love you!

223
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:09,311
Bye-bye, Sesame Street.

224
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:11,814
Good-bye, Bird.

225
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:16,819
Don't forget, I'm coming to visit!

226
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,844
Wow! Look at the clouds, Radar.

227
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,346
Isn't flying wonderful?

228
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:45,848
Makes me feel like a bird.

229
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,850
Heh heh heh!

230
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:48,851
Heh heh heh!

231
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,855
♫ La la la la la ♫

232
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,858
♫ La la la la.. ♫

233
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,361
Ahem.

234
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,382
Hey, Radar!

235
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,885
We're landing in our new home!

236
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,888
Oceanview, Illinois.

237
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,389
Boy, in a couple of minutes,

238
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,892
We're gonna meet our new bird family..

239
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,393
The Dodos.

240
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:32,895
Ladies and gentlemen,

241
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:33,896
Good afternoon.

242
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:37,399
CTW Flight 1138 from New York

243
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,401
Is now arriving at gate 2.

244
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:40,402
Which gate did she say?

245
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,905
Oh, dear, I don't know!

246
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,908
Let's wait here.

247
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:46,909
Gee.

248
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,912
Oh, look!
Is that a bird?

249
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,914
No. It's a plane.

250
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:53,916
Maybe this is the wrong airport.

251
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,919
But how can an airport be wrong?

252
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,420
I think we should go to the
snack bar.

253
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,923
I want a bird dog, Daddy.

254
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:01,924
Yeah, a bird dog!

255
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,426
Oh, I hate to think of him
being lost.

256
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:06,428
He's only 6 years old.

257
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:07,429
Oops!

258
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:08,931
Sorry. Sorry.

259
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:10,432
Excuse me.

260
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,434
Was there a big yellow bird

261
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:13,435
On this plane?

262
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,938
Well, only me.

263
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,440
Oh, too bad!

264
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,442
Maybe he'll be on the next plane.

265
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:21,944
Yeah, next plane!

266
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:26,448
Say, you must be the Dodos!

267
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:29,451
Yeah!
Yes!

268
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:30,953
I'm Daddy Dodo.

269
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,454
I'm Mommy Dodo.

270
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:33,455
I'm Donny.

271
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:34,957
And I'm Marie.

272
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:35,958
Who are you?

273
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:39,461
Why, I'm Big Bird!

274
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:40,963
What?!

275
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:41,964
No, you're not!

276
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,466
You're Big Dodo!

277
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:45,968
Yeah!
Yeah!

278
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,472
Big Dodo?

279
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,480
Look, Big Dodo,

280
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,482
This is our street, Canary Row.

281
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:01,984
Where are we going?
Where are you taking me?

282
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,485
Is this the airport?

283
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:13,996
Here we are.

284
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,498
Well, we made it.
I told you I could find it.

285
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:18,500
Find what, dear?

286
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,502
I... Can't remember.

287
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,004
I'm so proud of you, father.

288
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:24,506
Thanks, son.
It's great to be here.

289
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,009
You have to come home before
you can leave.

290
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,013
Here we are.

291
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,015
Don't be shy, Big Dodo.

292
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,019
Whoop!

293
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,021
Ha ha ha ha ha!

294
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:45,027
Gee whiz.

295
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,533
Bird would be so proud of me.

296
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:54,536
I've watched his things all week,

297
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:57,539
And nothing has moved.

298
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:04,546
Come on, Barkley.
Cheer up, boy.

299
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:07,049
We miss Big Bird, too.

300
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,550
Oh, hey, look, everybody!

301
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,053
A letter from Big Bird!

302
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:15,557
Big Bird! Come on!
Everyone come on!

303
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,059
What's he say?
What's he say?

304
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,561
Uh...

305
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:20,562
He starts,

306
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,564
"Dear friends..."

307
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,566
Uhh.

308
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:27,069
"Here I am in my new home.

309
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,570
"It sure is a lot different

310
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,573
"From my nest on Sesame Street.

311
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,575
"The Dodos are a nice family.

312
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,077
"They live in a birdhouse

313
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:37,079
with a big front lawn.

314
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:41,083
"They spend a lot of time
there digging for worms.

315
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,085
"They never seem to find any,

316
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:47,589
but they love to do it."

317
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:50,092
Gee, I don't see any worms here.

318
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,594
"The Dodos have lots of great things

319
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:56,598
like a lawn mower you can ride on."

320
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:02,104
"I'm not sure they know how
to use it right,

321
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:06,108
"But nobody's perfect.

322
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,610
"The Dodos like to stay in shape.

323
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:12,114
Every morning, we do our exercises."

324
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,616
Come up off the floor,

325
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:16,618
And start jogging in place.

326
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,621
Left and right.

327
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,623
Yippee! Yippee!

328
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:22,624
Look at me, Mommy.

329
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,626
Yippee!
Whoo-hoo!

330
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:25,627
I'm getting tired.

331
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,129
Don't stop, Daddy.

332
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,630
Pressing it down.

333
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,133
I need a rest.

334
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,634
Four more.
Hold on.

335
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:34,636
Three more.
Come on. Get tough.

336
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,138
Two more and...

337
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,639
Cross your hands in front.

338
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:40,642
"Sometimes, after a hard workout,

339
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,144
we take a dip in the pool."

340
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,146
♫ By the sea, By the sea ♫

341
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,148
"Now, that's fun."

342
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,652
Aah!

343
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:51,653
Aah!

344
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:58,160
"Well, it's time to go to sleep now."

345
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,665
Well, uh, good night.

346
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,669
Ohh.

347
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,671
Ahem.

348
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:13,675
"So that's my new home."

349
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:14,676
Night.

350
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,182
"I should be happy here."

351
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,685
"What's wrong with me?"

352
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:29,191
"Love, Big Dodo"?

353
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:31,193
Big Dodo?

354
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:34,696
"Big Bird to you."

355
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:36,698
Oh, dear.

356
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:40,202
Sounds like Bird needs me.

357
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:41,703
I know.

358
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:44,206
I'll write him a postcard

359
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:49,211
and ask if it's ok to come
visit now.

360
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,879
Hmm.

361
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,382
Hey, I've got a great idea.

362
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,384
Let's play make-believe.

363
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,885
I'll be Snow White.

364
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,387
But you're not Snow White.

365
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,888
You're bright yellow.

366
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:00,889
Yeah!

367
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:04,393
Well.. and you could be the
Seven Dwarfs.

368
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,395
But we're not dwarfs.

369
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,897
We're... Birds.

370
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:13,402
I said we just could make believe.

371
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,903
You know, pretend,

372
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:17,406
Use your imagination.

373
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,408
Oh, ok.

374
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:22,411
I'll pretend I'm Donny!

375
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,913
And I'll pretend I'm Marie.

376
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:26,915
Ha ha ha!
Boy, this is swell!

377
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:28,917
I like this game.
What a great time!

378
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,420
Get the door, Marie.

379
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,421
No way. Uh-uh.

380
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:33,922
Go on. Get the door.

381
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,424
Get the door.
Go get it.

382
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:36,425
Nope. Uh-uh.

383
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,426
Don't be stubborn.

384
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,927
♫ I'm not gonna get it ♫

385
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:40,929
Get the door, Marie!

386
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,932
Never mind.
I'll get it.

387
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,437
Oh. Hi, Mr. Postman.

388
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:52,941
Post card for, uh,
Mr., uh, Big Bird.

389
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:55,444
Big Bird?
Hey, that's me!

390
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,446
Oh, boy! I wonder who it's from.

391
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,448
I don't know, but I hope

392
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,949
He's not sending you any packages.

393
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:03,952
Oh, yeah!
Bye-bye!

394
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:08,457
Let's see.
It says, "Dear Bird."

395
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,958
That's me.

396
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,960
It goes on.

397
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,463
"I am ready to come and visit.

398
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:18,967
Your best friend, Mr. Snuffleupagus."

399
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,969
Oh, Snuffy.

400
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,971
Who's Mr. Snuff..
Snuff..

401
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,473
Snuff..
Snuffleupagus.

402
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,474
Yeah.

403
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,976
He's my best friend.

404
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:30,979
What kind of a bird is he?

405
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,482
He's not a bird.

406
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,984
He's a Snuffleupagus.

407
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:38,987
Snuffleguppygus.
Snuffleguppygus.

408
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:42,991
But your best friend should
be a bird.

409
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,493
Why?

410
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:47,496
Because you are a bird.

411
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,997
Isn't that right, Daddy?

412
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:49,998
That's right, Mommy.

413
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:53,001
You should be with your own kind.
Birds!

414
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,504
You'll find lots of birds your
own age.

415
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,506
And make some new best friends.

416
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,509
Now come on out and hunt for worms.

417
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:03,011
But I don't want to hunt worms.

418
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,013
I want Snuffy to come and visit,

419
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,515
and if he can't come and visit,

420
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,017
I don't want to be here anymore.

421
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:11,019
I want to go home.

422
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:14,523
But you are home.

423
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,024
Ha ha ha!

424
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:47,055
There are varying opinions

425
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,557
all through the west on this subject,

426
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:51,059
However, most agree Congress

427
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:53,562
will make up its mind about
that sometime next year.

428
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:55,063
Now, the weather.

429
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,566
It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood.

430
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:00,068
A beautiful day for a neighbor.

431
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:02,571
Would you be mine?

432
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,573
More on that later.

433
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:08,076
This news just in

434
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,078
Concerning a 6-year-old runaway.

435
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:12,581
The runaway's an 8-foot yellow bird

436
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,583
Who answers to the name
Big Bird.

437
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,085
Did you say Big Bird?

438
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:20,088
That's right, Big Bird.

439
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,089
He left his nest

440
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,591
in Oceanview, Illinois, last night

441
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:24,593
And is reportedly heading east

442
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:27,095
for a place called Se-same Street.

443
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:29,097
Se-same Street?

444
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:31,099
Sesame. Sesame.

445
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,601
Sesame Street.

446
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,102
Sorry.

447
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:35,103
Here now with the report

448
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:38,607
Is our correspondent,
Kermit The Frog.

449
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,108
Ok, here's one:

450
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,110
Why does a chicken not cross
the road?

451
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:43,111
'cause it's chicken,

452
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:44,613
Get it?

453
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:47,115
Kermit...
You're on.

454
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:50,118
Oh, heigh-ho, Kermit The Frog

455
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:52,120
Here in Oceanview, Illinois,

456
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,623
with the thank-you note that
Big Bird left

457
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:57,125
saying he was running back to
Sesame Street.

458
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,126
The note reads,

459
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,129
"Dear Dodos,
you are a very nice family.

460
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,631
"Thanks for everything,

461
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:05,634
"But I'm walking back to Sesame Street.

462
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,636
"I should be there in three hours

463
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:10,138
"Since it took two hours to
fly here.

464
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,640
"So if anyone calls,

465
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,141
"You know where to reach me.

466
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:14,643
Love, Big Bird."

467
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,645
And here is the family that he left,

468
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:19,147
The Dodos.

469
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:20,148
Are we on television?

470
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:22,651
Yes, you are.

471
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:25,153
We finally hit the big time.

472
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:27,155
Let's go inside and watch.

473
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:32,661
Now, who'd run away from a
family like that?

474
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:33,662
Uh... Uh...

475
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:36,164
They.. they certainly look
very worried.

476
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:38,667
Ah.

477
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,168
Dodos, be careful there.

478
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:42,170
Watch it.

479
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,673
Well, there you have it,
ladies and gentlemen...

480
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:47,175
The Dodos.

481
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,177
And, uh...

482
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:51,179
They certainly are.

483
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:53,682
One green froggie.

484
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:54,683
To complete the picture,

485
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:56,685
Let's have a few words with
Miss Finch

486
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:58,186
of The Feathered Friends.

487
00:23:58,186 --> 00:23:59,187
Excuse me, Miss Finch.

488
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:01,690
You sent Big Bird to the Dodos,
didn't you?

489
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,693
Yes. I found him a lovely home.

490
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,695
And why was that?

491
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:10,198
Because he belongs with his
own kind.

492
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:12,200
What kind is that?

493
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,201
Birds.

494
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:14,703
Hmm. Yes. Well,

495
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,705
Why do you suppose he ran away
from home?

496
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,707
I can't imagine.
Quiet!

497
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:21,710
Such a lovely home.
Such a lovely family.

498
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,712
We at The Feathered Friends

499
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:26,214
Take such pride in finding
the right environment

500
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,216
for homeless birdlings.

501
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:30,218
You think maybe he didn't like
it here

502
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:31,219
Or something?

503
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:32,721
Impossible.
Hmm.

504
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,222
Well, what are you going to do

505
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:35,724
About it, Ms. Finch?

506
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:40,228
I'm going to find Big Bird,
wherever he is,

507
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:43,231
And bring him back to the Dodos.

508
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:45,734
Well, you heard it right here, folks.

509
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,237
This has been Kermit The Frog

510
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:51,239
Speaking to you from Oceanview, Illinois,

511
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,742
So now, back to you, guy.

512
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:58,246
Ok, Radar, old buddy,

513
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:00,749
We've got to split up,

514
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,250
Throw them off track.

515
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,752
Don't worry,

516
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,254
I'm sending you bear-mail.

517
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:11,259
See you on Sesame Street.

518
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:25,273
Ah!

519
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,277
Telly, it's gonna be all right.

520
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:32,781
Oh, Olivia. I'm so worried
about Big Bird.

521
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:33,782
Well, don't!

522
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,283
He's out there all alone,

523
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:37,285
and Miss Finch could get him.

524
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:38,787
Not if we find him first,

525
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:41,289
and believe me, Telly, we will.

526
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:43,291
Isn't that right?
Yeah!

527
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:44,292
All right, listen, everybody.

528
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:45,293
Here's the plan.

529
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:47,295
We're here...

530
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:49,297
And Big Bird is here,

531
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:52,300
Heading toward Sesame Street.

532
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,302
We hope.
Ok.

533
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:56,304
Gordon, you're going to take
the volkswagen

534
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:59,307
On this route here.

535
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:00,809
You got it, Bob.

536
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,311
Linda, you go with Gordon.

537
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:05,313
Boy, I'd better work on that car.

538
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:09,317
Oscar, the sloppy jalopy will
take route 12,

539
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:12,821
and, Maria,
you better stick with Oscar.

540
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:13,822
All right.

541
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:15,824
Hey, you and me, skinny.

542
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:18,827
The Countmobile will take this
road here.

543
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:22,330
You should meet Big Bird
around toadstool.

544
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,332
Toadstool?
Toadstool?

545
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:26,334
Now, if you get there and you
haven't found him,

546
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:27,836
phone here.

547
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:28,837
Any questions?

548
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,338
Yes, I have a question.

549
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:31,840
What is it, Oscar?

550
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,843
What is the capital of South Dakota?

551
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:37,345
Oh, Oscar.

552
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:39,347
Oscar, if you don't want
To go on this trip,

553
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:40,348
You don't have to.

554
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:41,349
Are you kidding?

555
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:44,853
I love wild goose chases.

556
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,354
Let's go get lost.

557
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:49,858
No, let's all find Big Bird!

558
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:59,367
Ah, 1, 2, 3 cars

559
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:00,869
going to find Big Bird.

560
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,370
Bye-bye.

561
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:07,375
Cookie, will you stop eating
the hubcaps?

562
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,878
Oh, taste delicious.
Me so hungry.

563
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,881
But, Cook, we haven't even
started our trip yet.

564
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,382
That's ok.

565
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:15,884
Me eat three other hubcaps later.

566
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:16,885
Cookie!

567
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:19,387
Well, I think we're ready to go.

568
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:20,889
I got a Honker in the back

569
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,390
Because my horn's broken.

570
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,392
And now it's time to see

571
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:26,895
some of the Great Grouch
Landmarks of America.

572
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,396
No, it's not.

573
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:30,899
Now it's time to find Big Bird, remember?

574
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,400
Yeah!

575
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,902
Party pooper.

576
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:53,421
Aha! This is a job for super
Gro.. oh!

577
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:56,424
Oh, my cape got cut in half.

578
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:57,425
I'll take a taxi.

579
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:58,927
We're coming, Big Bird.

580
00:27:58,927 --> 00:27:59,928
We're coming, Big..

581
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:00,929
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

582
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:01,930
Are you sure you know

583
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:02,931
How to fly a plane?

584
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,432
Trust me, Bert.

585
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:06,935
I don't know about this.

586
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:10,438
Well, they're off.

587
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:12,941
Think they're gonna find
Big Bird, Adrian?

588
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,443
I hope so.

589
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:17,445
Me, too.

590
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:20,949
I wonder where Big Bird is now.

591
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:26,121
♫ La la la la la! ♫

592
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:28,123

598
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,661
Hi.

599
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,178
Hey, fellas,

600
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,180
Can you give me a lift?

601
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,182
Talk to who? Oh. Him.

602
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:30,185
Say, you must be the driver.

603
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,687
Well, what can I do for you,
big fella?

604
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:35,690
Do you have room for just one more?

605
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,692
I don't take no riders.

606
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:40,195
This here's a turkey truck.

607
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:42,197
Oh, well,

608
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:45,700
But my friend Oscar always says

609
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,702
That I'm a big turkey.

610
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,708
Well, I don't guess I can
argue with that.

611
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:54,709
Hop in.

612
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:04,719
So, you are the bird on the
run, huh?

613
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:06,721
Oh, yeah, and I can't wait to
get back

614
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:09,224
To my real home on Sesame Street.

615
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:13,728
I figure I can walk back there
in, oh, about three hours.

616
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:14,729
Three hours?

617
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,732
More like three weeks, buddy.

618
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:19,234
Three weeks?!

619
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,236
Oh, no!

620
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,238
I'll never get home.

621
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:24,739
Sure, you will.

622
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:26,741
You just gotta keep going.

623
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:29,244
Pick up your feet, follow your beak.

624
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,745
I don't know...

625
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:31,746
Listen to me, son.

626
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:34,749
♫ I found out a long time ago ♫

627
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:37,752

♫ 'Cause the dream can take
you anywhere ♫

643
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,809
Take me to cookies!

Putt, putt.

Picky, picky, picky.

657
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,843
Oh, no!
Whoa!

658
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:12,347
I never promised you a rose garden.

659
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,352
We're gonna find him,
all right, Bert.

660
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:18,353
Yeah.

661
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:19,854
Hey, you remember what color
he is?

662
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:20,855
What?

663
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:21,856
He's yellow.

664
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:23,358

684

Everything will turn out fine.

685
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:37,432
This is the worst circus I've
ever been to in my life.

686
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:54,449
That 8-foot bird's still on
the lam.

687
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:57,952
You know, Sid, people would
pay money to see that bird.

688
00:33:57,952 --> 00:34:02,457
Nah, I wouldn't pay to see no bird.

689
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:05,960
No, no, no. People would pay
us to see that bird.

690
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,463
Us, us, us!

691
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,465
Hey!

692
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:11,966
Hey, let me down!

693
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:14,469
If you wanna get down it'll
cost you another nickel.

694
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,471
It's 10 cents for the round trip, kid.

695
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,973
10 cents?!
What a rip-off.

696
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,992
You stole my apple.

697
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:40,995
Is that so?

698
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:42,497
That's my apple.

699
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:44,999
Well, this ain't your day,
is it, kid?

700
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:47,502
Here. Now get out of here!
Scram!

701
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:52,507
A big, fat nickel.

702
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,509
If we catch that bird,

703
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:56,010
those nickels will be dollars.

704
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,012
Think of it, Sid.
The big time.

705
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,014
Yeah, but how are we gonna
catch that bird?

706
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:03,017
I don't know.

707
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:09,390
I just may have to use my brain.

708
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:10,892
Thanks a lot.

709
00:35:10,892 --> 00:35:11,893
Hey, good luck.

710
00:35:11,893 --> 00:35:12,894
Thank you.
You know what?

711
00:35:12,894 --> 00:35:14,896
You're gonna make it home just fine.

712
00:35:14,896 --> 00:35:15,897
Ok.

713
00:35:15,897 --> 00:35:18,399
Bye.

714
00:35:21,903 --> 00:35:25,406
Now, I wonder how I get to
Sesame Street.

715
00:35:25,406 --> 00:35:29,410
Hmm.

716
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:30,411
Let's see...

717
00:35:30,411 --> 00:35:33,414
No, not that way.

718
00:35:35,416 --> 00:35:39,420
Ah. "No thru road."

719
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,422
That must be it.

720
00:35:41,422 --> 00:35:45,927
♫ Well, there ain't no road

721

Boy, "No thru road" sure is
awful long.

728
00:36:06,948 --> 00:36:07,949
Ohh...

729
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:11,953
What, chickens?
I hear chickens.

730
00:36:16,457 --> 00:36:18,960
I love chickens.

731
00:36:27,969 --> 00:36:30,471
Maybe they'll invite me to dinner.

732
00:36:51,492 --> 00:36:52,493
You're the biggest chicken

733
00:36:52,994 --> 00:36:53,995
I've ever seen.

734
00:36:53,995 --> 00:36:56,998
I'm not a chicken, actually.

735
00:36:56,998 --> 00:37:00,001
I'm a bird on the run.

736
00:37:00,001 --> 00:37:04,005
Oh, yeah. Floyd, he's the bird
on TV who ran away.

737
00:37:04,005 --> 00:37:05,506
I didn't run away.

738
00:37:05,506 --> 00:37:08,509
I'm going back to my real
home on Sesame Street

739
00:37:08,509 --> 00:37:10,511
Where I belong.

740
00:37:10,511 --> 00:37:12,013
Are you tired?

741
00:37:12,013 --> 00:37:15,016
Well, maybe a little.

742
00:37:15,016 --> 00:37:19,020
I sure wish I had a place to sleep.

743
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,022
Have you ever slept in a barn?

744
00:37:24,025 --> 00:37:25,526
Hmm...

745
00:37:33,034 --> 00:37:35,036
Hey, not bad.

746
00:37:35,036 --> 00:37:37,538
Will you stay and play with
us tomorrow?

747
00:37:37,538 --> 00:37:39,540
Well, yeah.

748
00:37:40,041 --> 00:37:43,544
You know, I haven't played
with any kids for a whole week.

749
00:37:43,544 --> 00:37:46,547
Ok, but maybe just for a little while.

750
00:37:47,048 --> 00:37:48,049
Ruthie, Floyd!
Bedtime!

751
00:37:48,049 --> 00:37:49,050
Uh-oh.

752
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:51,552
We'd better go.

753
00:37:51,552 --> 00:37:54,055
Hey, well, thanks for the great bed.

754
00:38:01,062 --> 00:38:02,063
Come on.

755
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:10,571
Good night.

756
00:38:11,072 --> 00:38:13,574
Good night, Floyd.

757
00:38:13,574 --> 00:38:16,077
Ok, Floyd.
Down you go.

758
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,081
See you in the morning.

759
00:38:20,581 --> 00:38:22,083
Good night, Ruthie.

760
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,904
♫ One little star ♫

761
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:47,908
♫ All alone in the sky ♫

762
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:53,414
♫ Do you ever get lonely ♫

763
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:58,419
♫ As the twilight drifts by? ♫

764
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:12,433
♫ One little star ♫

765
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:15,936
♫ In the darkening blue ♫

766
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:21,442
♫ Do you long for another ♫

767
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:26,947
♫ Just the way that I do? ♫

768
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,952
Good night, Barkley.

769
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:44,965
♫ Sky begins to fill ♫

770
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:49,970
♫ Darkness ends the day ♫

771
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,973
♫ Someone who I love ♫

772
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:57,978
♫ Is far away ♫

773
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,982
♫ One little star ♫

774
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:06,487
♫ Reaching far through the night ♫

775
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:11,492
♫ Do you shine on my someone? ♫

776
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:16,997
♫ Are we sharing your light? ♫

777
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:21,001
♫ Oh, one little star ♫

778
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:26,507
♫ shine on us both tonight ♫

779
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:32,513
Gee, I wish Olivia was here

780
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:34,515
to sing me a lullaby,

781
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:37,017
and Snuffy was here and we'd
be together.

782
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:40,521
I wonder what they're doing tonight.

783
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:44,525
♫ One little star ♫

784
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:45,526
♫ One little star ♫

785
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:47,528
♫ Reaching far through the night ♫

786
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:48,529
♫ Far ♫

787
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:50,531
♫ Far through the night ♫

788
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:54,535
♫ Won't you shine on my someone? ♫

789
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,036
♫ Shine on my someone ♫
♫ Someone ♫

790
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:58,038
♫ Somewhere sharing your light ♫

791
00:40:58,038 --> 00:41:01,542
♫ Please, share your light ♫
♫ Ah ah ah

792
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:05,546
♫ Oh, one little star ♫

793
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:08,048
♫ Shine on us all ♫

794
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:12,553
♫ Tonight ♫

795
00:41:50,291 --> 00:41:53,294
Bad eats?
The don't drop inn?

796
00:41:53,794 --> 00:41:55,796
Oscar, I'm so hungry.

797
00:41:55,796 --> 00:41:57,798
Let's go someplace else.

798
00:41:57,798 --> 00:42:00,801
No way! We had lunch at Friendly's.

799
00:42:01,302 --> 00:42:02,303
Now it's my turn.

800
00:42:02,303 --> 00:42:03,304
Oh, all right.

801
00:42:03,304 --> 00:42:05,306
At least we can use the phone

802
00:42:05,306 --> 00:42:06,807
and call Sesame Street.

803
00:42:06,807 --> 00:42:07,808
Come on, guys.

804
00:42:07,808 --> 00:42:08,809
No, thanks!

805
00:42:08,809 --> 00:42:09,810
I've had enough Grouch food

806
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:12,313
to last me a lifetime!

807
00:42:12,313 --> 00:42:15,816
Telly, you're missing an
unforgettable dining experience.

808
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:23,824
Hey, waitress,
there's no fly in my soup!

809
00:42:23,824 --> 00:42:24,825
It's coming!

810
00:42:24,825 --> 00:42:26,327
Hey!
I need a glass.

811
00:42:26,327 --> 00:42:28,329
Broken or dirty?

812
00:42:28,829 --> 00:42:29,330
Waitress!

813
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:30,831
It's about time.

814
00:42:34,835 --> 00:42:35,836
This is my masterpiece.

815
00:42:36,337 --> 00:42:37,838
Beautiful!
Just beautiful!

816
00:42:40,841 --> 00:42:42,843
Hey, give me that syrup back.

817
00:42:43,344 --> 00:42:44,845
Get lost!

818
00:42:44,845 --> 00:42:47,348
Operator?

819
00:42:47,348 --> 00:42:48,849
Operator!

820
00:42:48,849 --> 00:42:50,851
Operator!

821
00:42:50,851 --> 00:42:53,854
What kind of service is this?

822
00:42:53,854 --> 00:42:58,359
Waitress, I ordered this Jell-o
medium rare.

823
00:42:58,359 --> 00:43:00,361
This is well-done.

824
00:43:00,361 --> 00:43:01,862
There you go.

825
00:43:01,862 --> 00:43:05,366
A stack of spaghetti with maple syrup.

826
00:43:05,366 --> 00:43:06,867
Terrible!

827
00:43:06,867 --> 00:43:08,369
I love it.

828
00:43:08,369 --> 00:43:10,871
Look at this real Grouch dining.

829
00:43:10,871 --> 00:43:13,374
Meat loaf with marshmallow sauce,

830
00:43:13,374 --> 00:43:16,877
candied clams with french dressing!

831
00:43:16,877 --> 00:43:18,879
Cream of garlic soup

832
00:43:18,879 --> 00:43:21,382
with Maraschino cherries?

833
00:43:21,382 --> 00:43:22,883
There's nothing here I can eat.

834
00:43:22,883 --> 00:43:24,385
Name your poison.

835
00:43:24,385 --> 00:43:26,387
Tonight's specials are roast beef

836
00:43:26,387 --> 00:43:28,889
with butterscotch and Anchovies..

837
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:29,890
What about my Jell-o?

838
00:43:30,391 --> 00:43:32,893
Keep your shirt on!

839
00:43:32,893 --> 00:43:35,896
Ham with doughnuts, oatmeal sauce..

840
00:43:35,896 --> 00:43:37,398
Stop.

841
00:43:37,398 --> 00:43:38,899
And tossed salad.

842
00:43:38,899 --> 00:43:40,901
Tossed salad?

843
00:43:41,402 --> 00:43:43,404
That sounds safe.

844
00:43:43,404 --> 00:43:46,407
Uh, there's nothing in it

845
00:43:46,407 --> 00:43:49,410
like candied clams or anything
like that?

846
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:50,411
What are you, a wacko?

847
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:52,913
Of course not.

848
00:43:52,913 --> 00:43:54,915
Good. I'll have the tossed salad.

849
00:43:54,915 --> 00:43:56,417
Hey, better make that two.

850
00:43:56,917 --> 00:43:58,919
Two tossed salads!

851
00:44:02,423 --> 00:44:05,426
Number two coming right up!

852
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:11,432
That salad looks marvelous!

853
00:44:11,432 --> 00:44:13,434
Give me one!

854
00:44:13,434 --> 00:44:15,436
I was first!

855
00:44:15,436 --> 00:44:17,438
Yeah, me, too!

856
00:44:17,438 --> 00:44:18,939
Give me some.

857
00:44:18,939 --> 00:44:20,441
Salad for everybody!

858
00:44:23,944 --> 00:44:25,446
Stop! You stop it!

859
00:44:25,946 --> 00:44:27,448
Fire!

860
00:44:27,448 --> 00:44:29,450
Just..
Now stop that!

861
00:44:40,461 --> 00:44:41,462
Heh heh heh heh!

862
00:44:49,163 --> 00:44:52,166
Gee, maybe we made a mistake.

863
00:44:52,166 --> 00:44:54,669
That salad looks great!

864
00:44:56,170 --> 00:45:00,675
Where's my Jell-o?

865
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:30,371
Good morning!

866
00:45:30,371 --> 00:45:31,872
Good morning!

867
00:45:37,378 --> 00:45:40,881
Hey, I never knew water came
out of the ground.

868
00:45:40,881 --> 00:45:42,883
Here. Try it.

869
00:45:44,352 --> 00:45:45,353
Like this?

870
00:45:45,353 --> 00:45:46,354
Uh-huh.

871
00:45:51,859 --> 00:45:52,860
That's funny.

872
00:45:56,364 --> 00:45:58,366
Say, what's going on here?

873
00:45:58,366 --> 00:45:59,867
Here. It's easy.

874
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:03,371

The hay field.

Run!

Wait!

916
00:48:20,541 --> 00:48:22,543
Bye.
Bye-bye.

917
00:48:22,543 --> 00:48:24,044
Oh, oh, dear.

918
00:48:24,044 --> 00:48:25,546
Oh, oh, oh!

919
00:48:35,055 --> 00:48:37,057
Where did that big yellow bird go?

920
00:48:37,057 --> 00:48:39,560
I don't know.
I don't know.

921
00:48:47,067 --> 00:48:50,070
All right.
Where are you?

922
00:48:56,076 --> 00:48:58,078
Ah! Ah...

923
00:49:30,611 --> 00:49:33,113
Sam, I've been holding this net
for an hour. You take it.

924
00:49:33,614 --> 00:49:34,615
How am I supposed to hold that net

925
00:49:34,615 --> 00:49:35,616
While I'm driving?

926
00:49:35,616 --> 00:49:36,617
I'll drive.

927
00:49:36,617 --> 00:49:37,618
No way, Jose!

928
00:49:38,118 --> 00:49:39,119
Last time you drove,

929
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:42,122
You ran that watermelon
truck right off the road.

930
00:49:42,122 --> 00:49:44,124
Watermelons everywhere.

931
00:49:44,124 --> 00:49:45,626
Yeah, they were good.

932
00:49:45,626 --> 00:49:47,628
I had to buy those watermelons!

933
00:49:47,628 --> 00:49:50,130
They were still good.

934
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:53,133
Look, a haystack.

935
00:49:55,135 --> 00:49:57,137
We're not looking for
haystacks, chowderhead.

936
00:49:57,137 --> 00:49:58,639
Keep your eyes peeled.

937
00:49:59,139 --> 00:50:01,141
Big Bird's gotta be around
here somewhere.

938
00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:19,793
Gee, still no sign of Sesame Street.

939
00:50:19,793 --> 00:50:23,797
Nothing but amber waves of grain.

940
00:50:23,797 --> 00:50:25,799
I think I'm lost.

941
00:50:25,799 --> 00:50:26,800
What will I do?

942
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,802
I wish Snuffy were here.

943
00:50:28,802 --> 00:50:31,805
Then I'd be lost with my best friend.

944
00:50:31,805 --> 00:50:34,308
Hello, Bird.

945
00:50:34,308 --> 00:50:37,311
Snuffy? I thought I'd never
see you again.

946
00:50:37,311 --> 00:50:40,314
I can hardly see you now.

947
00:50:40,314 --> 00:50:45,319
That is because you are
imagining me, Bird.

948
00:50:45,319 --> 00:50:47,821
Well, it's so good to almost
see you.

949
00:50:47,821 --> 00:50:49,823
I suppose a hug is out of the question,

950
00:50:49,823 --> 00:50:52,326
You being imaginary right now.

951
00:50:52,326 --> 00:50:55,829
You could imagine that we're
hugging, bird.

952
00:50:55,829 --> 00:50:57,831
That's right!
How brilliant.

953
00:50:57,831 --> 00:50:58,832
Here it comes.

954
00:51:03,337 --> 00:51:07,341
I'm afraid this isn't working, Snuffy.

955
00:51:07,341 --> 00:51:09,343
For hugging, you need the real thing.

956
00:51:09,843 --> 00:51:12,346
Oh, don't worry, Bird.

957
00:51:12,846 --> 00:51:13,847
We can hug for real

958
00:51:13,847 --> 00:51:16,850
when you get back to Sesame Street.

959
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:19,353
If I ever get back to Sesame Street.

960
00:51:19,353 --> 00:51:21,355
But I will!

961
00:51:21,855 --> 00:51:23,857
Uh-oh.
Snuffy? Snuffy?

962
00:51:23,857 --> 00:51:27,861
I guess I got to go now, Bird.
Bye-bye.

963
00:51:27,861 --> 00:51:30,364
Snuffy? Snuffy,
Please don't leave me.

964
00:51:30,864 --> 00:51:31,865
What's that?

965
00:51:38,872 --> 00:51:40,874
Oh, no.

966
00:51:40,874 --> 00:51:42,876
Could that be Miss Finch?

967
00:51:42,876 --> 00:51:44,878
Ernie, I see him!

968
00:51:44,878 --> 00:51:45,879
See who, Bert?

969
00:51:45,879 --> 00:51:48,382
See that yellow spot down there?
It's Big Bird.

970
00:51:48,382 --> 00:51:51,885
Oh, yeah. Sure looks like
a yellow spot, all right.

971
00:51:51,885 --> 00:51:54,388
Ernie, do something so he knows
we're here, quick!

972
00:51:54,388 --> 00:51:55,889
Ok.
Hang on, Bert.

973
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:20,414
Ernie! What are you doing?

974
00:52:20,414 --> 00:52:22,416
Ernie, watch out!

975
00:52:22,916 --> 00:52:24,418
Ernieeeeeeee!

976
00:52:24,418 --> 00:52:26,420
I'm just trying to get his attention, Bert.

977
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:27,421
Isn't this fun?

978
00:52:27,621 --> 00:52:30,124
♫ La la la la ♫

979
00:52:30,124 --> 00:52:33,627
Ernie, this is no time for singing.

980
00:52:33,627 --> 00:52:35,129
Oh, come on, Bert.

981
00:52:35,129 --> 00:52:37,631
♫ Come fly with me in an
upside-down world ♫

982
00:52:38,132 --> 00:52:41,635
♫ There's so many strange
things to see ♫

983
00:52:41,635 --> 00:52:45,139
♫ There's upside-down people
who walk down the street ♫

984
00:52:45,139 --> 00:52:48,142
♫ With upside-down shoes on
their upside-down feet ♫

985
00:52:48,142 --> 00:52:50,144
♫ In an upside-down world ♫

986
00:52:50,144 --> 00:52:51,145
Ernie!

987
00:52:51,145 --> 00:52:53,147
♫ In an upside-down world ♫

988
00:52:53,147 --> 00:52:54,648
Ernie, I don't feel too good.

989
00:52:54,648 --> 00:52:58,652
Whee!
♫ it's fun to be in an upside-down world ♫

990
00:52:59,153 --> 00:53:02,156
♫ There's fish that fall out
of the sea ♫

991
00:53:02,156 --> 00:53:05,659
♫ There's upside-down clocks
that make everyone late ♫

992
00:53:05,659 --> 00:53:09,163
♫ Upside-down food that won't
stay on your plate ♫

993
00:53:09,163 --> 00:53:11,665
♫ In an upside-down world ♫

994
00:53:11,665 --> 00:53:13,667
♫ In an upside-down world ♫

995
00:53:13,667 --> 00:53:16,170
Oh, my bottle cap collection!

996
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:18,172
Hey, listen, I got an idea, Bert.

997
00:53:18,172 --> 00:53:21,175
How would you like to take
over the controls?

998
00:53:21,175 --> 00:53:22,676
No! No!

999
00:53:22,676 --> 00:53:25,179
Sure, Bert.
It's really easy.

1000
00:53:25,679 --> 00:53:27,681
No! No! Never in a million years.

1001
00:53:28,182 --> 00:53:29,183
Hey, Bert,
I'm gonna trade places with you.

1002
00:53:29,183 --> 00:53:31,685
What? What?!
No, Ernie!

1003
00:53:33,687 --> 00:53:36,690
A hailstorm?

1004
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:40,194
♫ There's upside-down
everything all over town ♫

1005
00:53:40,194 --> 00:53:43,697
♫ It all looks so funny that
I've got to frown ♫

1006
00:53:43,697 --> 00:53:47,201
♫ 'Cause a frown is a smile
when you turn upside-down ♫

1007
00:53:47,201 --> 00:53:48,202
♫ In an upside-down ♫

1008
00:53:48,702 --> 00:53:50,204
♫ What-side down, whoop-side down ♫

1009
00:53:50,204 --> 00:53:51,705
♫ Oop-side down, what-side down ♫

1010
00:53:51,705 --> 00:53:54,708
♫ Upside-down world ♫

1011
00:53:54,708 --> 00:53:57,211
Ernie, don't stop.
This is fun.

1012
00:53:57,211 --> 00:53:58,712
Bert, there's no time for fun now.

1013
00:53:59,213 --> 00:54:01,882
We've got to find Big Bird.

1014
00:54:07,387 --> 00:54:10,891
Oh, no,
I'm afraid you've lost him, Bert.

1015
00:54:10,891 --> 00:54:12,392
I've lost him?

1016
00:54:12,392 --> 00:54:14,394
Yeah, while you were singing, Bert.

1017
00:54:14,394 --> 00:54:15,395
You were singing, too.

1018
00:54:15,896 --> 00:54:18,398
Why didn't you tell me?
You always do that to me.

1019
00:54:18,398 --> 00:54:20,901
Oh, Bert, why don't you turn
the plane around now?

1020
00:54:20,901 --> 00:54:22,402
You please drive.

1021
00:54:22,402 --> 00:54:23,904
Can you turn the plane around?

1022
00:54:23,904 --> 00:54:25,405
You drive it!

1023
00:54:25,405 --> 00:54:27,407
It's that stick in front of you.

1024
00:54:27,407 --> 00:54:28,408
Turn the plane, Bert.

1025
00:54:30,878 --> 00:54:33,380
Oh, my little super body

1026
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:35,382
Is tired from all this flying.

1027
00:54:35,883 --> 00:54:39,386
Big Bird, where are you?

1028
00:54:39,386 --> 00:54:43,390
Wait! I see a yellow something
over there.

1029
00:54:43,390 --> 00:54:47,895
Birdie, I am coming!

1030
00:54:48,896 --> 00:54:50,397
Yum yum yum yum.

1031
00:54:52,399 --> 00:54:53,400
If you gotta eat,

1032
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,903
Go eat Olivia's luggage.

1033
00:54:55,903 --> 00:54:57,404
Oh, thank you.

1034
00:54:57,404 --> 00:54:58,405
Gordon!

1035
00:55:00,407 --> 00:55:01,909
Wait a minute.

1036
00:55:01,909 --> 00:55:02,910
What is that?

1037
00:55:03,410 --> 00:55:06,413
Super Grover to the rescue!

1038
00:55:09,416 --> 00:55:11,418
Gordon, do something!
What's happening?

1039
00:55:11,418 --> 00:55:13,921
What? What? What?
Whoa!

1040
00:55:13,921 --> 00:55:15,923
Ahhhh!

1041
00:55:16,423 --> 00:55:17,424
Look out!

1042
00:55:20,928 --> 00:55:23,430
Big Bird, I found you!

1043
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:24,431
Big Bird!

1044
00:55:24,431 --> 00:55:25,933
Big..

1045
00:55:26,433 --> 00:55:27,935
This is not Big Bird.

1046
00:55:28,435 --> 00:55:29,937
You are impostors.

1047
00:55:30,437 --> 00:55:31,438
Grover.

1048
00:55:31,438 --> 00:55:33,440
Grover?

1049
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,442
Super Prover, please.

1050
00:55:35,442 --> 00:55:36,443
When's lunch?

1051
00:55:36,443 --> 00:55:37,945
Ha ha ha ha.

1052
00:55:41,949 --> 00:55:42,950
Whew.

1053
00:55:43,450 --> 00:55:44,952
Ooh. Oh, wow.

1054
00:55:44,952 --> 00:55:47,454
Oh.

1055
00:55:49,456 --> 00:55:50,958
Big yellow bird at 1:00.

1056
00:55:50,958 --> 00:55:51,959
It's that late already?

1057
00:55:52,459 --> 00:55:54,461
That's Air Force talk, you nerf.

1058
00:55:54,962 --> 00:55:56,964
Now come on!
Let's bag that bird.

1059
00:56:06,473 --> 00:56:07,975
My aching feet.

1060
00:56:12,479 --> 00:56:15,983
Well, I think I'll go rest
under that tree.

1061
00:56:22,489 --> 00:56:24,491
I can't believe it.

1062
00:56:24,491 --> 00:56:25,993
He's gone.

1063
00:56:25,993 --> 00:56:27,995
How could you miss him?!
He's 8 feet tall!

1064
00:56:28,495 --> 00:56:29,997
You were going too fast!

1065
00:56:29,997 --> 00:56:31,999
Sid... Don't shout at me.

1066
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:33,500
You were going too fast.

1067
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:36,503
Don't get mad.
We'll just start all over.

1068
00:56:36,503 --> 00:56:38,005
Now let's get going!

1069
00:56:38,005 --> 00:56:40,507
Oscar, I told you to stop this car.

1070
00:56:40,507 --> 00:56:44,011
Ok, that's it.
Stop this car right now.

1071
00:56:44,511 --> 00:56:46,513
We aren't anywhere near Toadstool.

1072
00:56:48,515 --> 00:56:51,018
Yeah, but this is where I want
to be.

1073
00:56:51,018 --> 00:56:53,520
Grouch Paradise.
Look at it.

1074
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,022
It's like a work of art.

1075
00:56:55,022 --> 00:56:57,524
It is different, Maria.

1076
00:56:57,524 --> 00:57:00,027
Oscar, I want you to turn this
heap around

1077
00:57:00,027 --> 00:57:02,029
and head for Toadstool!

1078
00:57:02,529 --> 00:57:05,032
An angry face in a beautiful place.

1079
00:57:05,032 --> 00:57:06,033
Heaven!

1080
00:57:06,033 --> 00:57:07,534
Ohh...

1081
00:57:14,541 --> 00:57:15,542
Hey, it looks like everyone's

1082
00:57:15,542 --> 00:57:17,544
Getting closer and closer to Toadstool.

1083
00:57:27,054 --> 00:57:29,056
You did it, Oscar!

1084
00:57:29,056 --> 00:57:32,059
Gee, I must have taken a wrong turn.

1085
00:57:38,565 --> 00:57:40,567
Hmm. Toadstool?

1086
00:57:40,567 --> 00:57:43,070
Sounds like another town full
of suckers.

1087
00:57:43,570 --> 00:57:45,072
Let's set up here.

1088
00:57:45,072 --> 00:57:46,573
What about the bird?

1089
00:57:46,573 --> 00:57:47,574
Don't worry about the bird.

1090
00:57:47,574 --> 00:57:50,077
I got a feeling he's gonna pop up

1091
00:57:50,077 --> 00:57:52,579
Right under our noses.

1092
00:57:52,579 --> 00:57:53,580
Let's see...

1093
00:57:54,081 --> 00:57:59,086
It says, "Welcome to Toadstool,

1094
00:57:59,586 --> 00:58:02,089
The Mushroom City."

1095
00:58:02,589 --> 00:58:04,091
The Mushroom City?

1096
00:58:04,091 --> 00:58:08,595
"Annual tournament of Mushrooms Parade."

1097
00:58:08,595 --> 00:58:11,098
Oh, boy! I love parades.

1098
00:58:11,098 --> 00:58:13,600
And Miss Finch will never find
me there.

1099
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:16,603
Poor little bird found at last.

1100
00:58:16,603 --> 00:58:18,605
Oh, hi, Miss Finch.

1101
00:58:18,605 --> 00:58:20,607
Miss Finch!
Oh, no!

1102
00:58:21,108 --> 00:58:23,610
Oh, ow! Oh, ow!

1103
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:25,112
Bird!

1104
00:58:25,112 --> 00:58:26,113
Bird!

1105
00:58:26,113 --> 00:58:27,114
Bird!

1106
00:58:27,114 --> 00:58:29,116
Get back here!

1107
00:58:30,117 --> 00:58:31,118
Ohh!

1108
00:58:59,646 --> 00:59:00,647
Ah!

1109
00:59:00,647 --> 00:59:03,150
Big Bird! Big Bird!

1110
00:59:14,661 --> 00:59:15,662
There he is!

1111
00:59:17,664 --> 00:59:19,666
Gordon, back it up!
We'll head him off!

1112
00:59:45,692 --> 00:59:47,694
Aha!
Aah!

1113
00:59:49,696 --> 00:59:51,698
Excuse me.
Let me out of here.

1114
00:59:55,202 --> 00:59:57,704
Let me out of here.

1115
00:59:57,704 --> 00:59:59,206
He's not getting away with this.

1116
01:00:12,719 --> 01:00:14,221
Oh, boy.

1117
01:00:14,221 --> 01:00:15,722
I hate parades.

1118
01:00:18,225 --> 01:00:20,227
Wait a minute.

1119
01:00:20,227 --> 01:00:21,228
Look.

1120
01:00:22,729 --> 01:00:25,232
Step on it, Oscar.
He's getting away.

1121
01:00:25,232 --> 01:00:26,733
Well, I wasn't watching.

1122
01:00:27,234 --> 01:00:27,734
Which way?

1123
01:00:28,235 --> 01:00:29,736
Go to the left.
Right.

1124
01:00:29,736 --> 01:00:33,106
We've been open 5 hours and
No suckers have showed up yet.

1125
01:00:33,106 --> 01:00:35,108
You must have done something wrong.

1126
01:00:35,108 --> 01:00:37,611
What about them darts?
Did you rig them?

1127
01:00:37,611 --> 01:00:39,613
Yeah. I put lead weights in
the tips of 'em,

1128
01:00:39,613 --> 01:00:40,614
So when you throw them,

1129
01:00:40,614 --> 01:00:42,115
They go right into the ground.

1130
01:00:42,115 --> 01:00:43,116
What about the invisible gorilla?

1131
01:00:43,116 --> 01:00:44,117
Did you print up those disclaimers?

1132
01:00:44,618 --> 01:00:47,120
Yeah. I printed up a whole
batch of 'em,

1133
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:48,622
But what difference does it make?

1134
01:00:48,622 --> 01:00:50,123
We got no customers.

1135
01:00:50,123 --> 01:00:52,125
Sam, we're washed up.

1136
01:00:53,627 --> 01:00:54,628
Hey, maybe not.

1137
01:00:55,128 --> 01:00:57,130
Check the gams on that butterball!

1138
01:01:00,634 --> 01:01:02,135
Hi.

1139
01:01:02,135 --> 01:01:04,638
I'll take care of it.

1140
01:01:04,638 --> 01:01:09,142
Say, there's a lady named
Miss Finch who's chasing me.

1141
01:01:09,142 --> 01:01:12,145
Do you mind if I hide in your
fun fair?

1142
01:01:12,646 --> 01:01:14,648
Why, no. Not at all.

1143
01:01:14,648 --> 01:01:17,150
We have the perfect place
for you to hide.

1144
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:20,654
Right here in our hiding cage.

1145
01:01:23,156 --> 01:01:24,157
You'll be safe here.

1146
01:01:24,658 --> 01:01:26,660
Yeah. Real safe.

1147
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:28,662
Gee, thanks.

1148
01:01:32,165 --> 01:01:33,166
Let's go.

1149
01:01:36,169 --> 01:01:39,172
Oh, gee, I sure am a lucky bird.

1150
01:01:44,177 --> 01:01:46,680
Wheee!

1151
01:01:51,685 --> 01:01:55,689
♫ La la la la la la la la la ♫

1152
01:01:55,689 --> 01:01:58,191
♫ La la la la ♫
♫ la la la la ♫

1153
01:02:16,710 --> 01:02:17,711
Oh, swell.

1154
01:02:17,711 --> 01:02:20,714
First a parade, now a carnival.

1155
01:02:20,714 --> 01:02:23,216
Why, it's enough to make a
Grouch sick.

1156
01:02:23,216 --> 01:02:24,217
Oscar...

1157
01:02:24,217 --> 01:02:25,719
I think we should forget this

1158
01:02:25,719 --> 01:02:27,721
And just go look for the
yellow turkey.

1159
01:02:27,721 --> 01:02:31,224
So step on it, Oscar,
or Miss Finch will get him.

1160
01:02:31,224 --> 01:02:32,225
Whoa!

1161
01:02:33,226 --> 01:02:38,732
Psst. Hey, guys,
you can let me out now.

1162
01:02:38,732 --> 01:02:40,233
Is it safe now?

1163
01:02:40,233 --> 01:02:41,735
Can I get out now?

1164
01:02:41,735 --> 01:02:44,237
What's the matter?
Don't you like your cage?

1165
01:02:44,237 --> 01:02:47,741
My cage?
M-m-my cage?

1166
01:02:49,743 --> 01:02:50,744
Hey, what are you talking about?

1167
01:02:50,744 --> 01:02:51,745
Let me out of here!

1168
01:02:51,745 --> 01:02:53,747
Hey, come on!
I don't want to stay in here!

1169
01:02:53,747 --> 01:02:55,749
You can't keep me in here!
This is bird-napping!

1170
01:02:55,749 --> 01:02:58,251
Hey, I just thought of something.

1171
01:02:58,251 --> 01:02:59,252
Everybody's looking
for an 8-foot yellow bird.

1172
01:02:59,252 --> 01:03:00,253
He's hot!

1173
01:03:00,253 --> 01:03:02,756
Keep your shirt on.

1174
01:03:02,756 --> 01:03:04,758
I'll be really good.
Ok, come on.

1175
01:03:04,758 --> 01:03:06,760
Guys, the joke is over.
Let me out.

1176
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:09,262
I got an idea.

1177
01:03:09,262 --> 01:03:11,564
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen,

1178
01:03:11,564 --> 01:03:12,565
Boys and girls.

1179
01:03:12,565 --> 01:03:15,568
On the inside, our main attraction,

1180
01:03:15,568 --> 01:03:17,070
The Bluebird of Happiness.

1181
01:03:17,070 --> 01:03:19,072
You've seen yhe invisible gorilla,

1182
01:03:19,072 --> 01:03:22,575
Now see the giant 8-foot
Bluebird of Happiness.

1183
01:03:23,076 --> 01:03:26,079
He's... One of a kind!

1184
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:29,082
Yes, he's incredible.
The Bluebird of Happiness.

1185
01:03:29,082 --> 01:03:31,084
He sings, he dances, he tells jokes!

1186
01:03:31,084 --> 01:03:32,585
Be sure to catch him now

1187
01:03:32,585 --> 01:03:35,088
Before his big European tour!

Hey, kids!

01:07:31,658 --> 01:07:32,659
Get away from the talent.

Hello, operator,

1252
01:07:49,175 --> 01:07:52,178
Can you tell me how to get to
Sesame Street?

1253
01:07:54,681 --> 01:07:57,183
Cookie, haven't you had enough?

1254
01:07:57,183 --> 01:07:59,185
But, Gordon, me growing monster.

1255
01:07:59,185 --> 01:08:01,187
That's how Bert lost Big Bird.

1256

I didn't do it!

1257
01:08:02,689 --> 01:08:03,690
You did, too, Bert.

1258
01:08:03,690 --> 01:08:05,692
Hey, Count, baby, what's happenin'?

1259
01:08:05,692 --> 01:08:09,195
Hi, Bob. No news about
Big Bird, I suppose.

1260
01:08:09,195 --> 01:08:10,196
Yeah.
We've located him.

1261
01:08:10,196 --> 01:08:11,698
What?!

1262
01:08:11,698 --> 01:08:14,200
He's right nearby,
locked in a cage.

1263
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:15,702
He's locked in a cage?

1264
01:08:15,702 --> 01:08:17,704
The kids saw him.
He's blue.

1265
01:08:17,704 --> 01:08:18,705
He's blue!
He's blue?

1266
01:08:19,205 --> 01:08:20,707
In some kind of carnival,
The kids said.

1267
01:08:21,207 --> 01:08:22,208
At a carnival...

1268
01:08:22,709 --> 01:08:23,710
Right. Maria...

1269
01:08:23,710 --> 01:08:25,211
That Fun Fair!

1270
01:08:25,211 --> 01:08:27,213
We passed that hours ago.

1271
01:08:27,213 --> 01:08:29,215
That's what she said.
Come on!

1272
01:08:29,215 --> 01:08:30,717
Bye, Bob!

1273
01:08:30,717 --> 01:08:32,218
How we gonna get him

1274
01:08:32,218 --> 01:08:33,720
If he's locked in a cage?

1275
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:35,221
Come on, Telly.

1276
01:08:35,722 --> 01:08:37,223
Whaaa!

1277
01:09:03,916 --> 01:09:06,419
What do you see, Ernie?

1278
01:09:08,421 --> 01:09:09,922
Your nose, Bert.

1279
01:09:09,922 --> 01:09:12,425
Ernie, get serious, will you?

1280
01:09:12,425 --> 01:09:14,927
We're supposed to be looking
for Big Bird.

1281
01:09:15,428 --> 01:09:16,429
Right.

1282
01:09:22,935 --> 01:09:24,937
Put them in bundles.

1283
01:09:26,439 --> 01:09:28,441
Bundles of a thousand,

1284
01:09:28,441 --> 01:09:29,942
and it's mine,

1285
01:09:31,444 --> 01:09:32,945
all mine.

1286
01:09:34,947 --> 01:09:38,951
Of course you can't see him.
He's invisible.

1287
01:09:40,453 --> 01:09:42,455
No place like home,

1288
01:09:42,455 --> 01:09:44,457
No place like home,

1289
01:09:44,457 --> 01:09:45,458
No place like...

1290
01:09:46,959 --> 01:09:48,961
Toto...

1291
01:09:48,961 --> 01:09:50,963
Step into this cage.

1292
01:09:51,464 --> 01:09:53,466
You'll be safe here.

1293
01:10:14,487 --> 01:10:15,988
No!

1294
01:10:15,988 --> 01:10:17,490
Stay here.

1295
01:10:33,506 --> 01:10:34,507
Maria.

1296
01:10:34,507 --> 01:10:36,509
Shh!

1297
01:10:36,509 --> 01:10:37,510
Maria,

1298
01:10:37,510 --> 01:10:39,512
Maria, how'd you get here?

1299
01:10:40,012 --> 01:10:41,514
How, hi, where,

1300
01:10:41,514 --> 01:10:43,516
How'd you get in?
Shh! Shh!

1301
01:10:43,516 --> 01:10:46,519
Don't worry, Big Bird.
We'll get you outta here.

1302
01:10:50,523 --> 01:10:51,524
Shh!

1303
01:10:59,532 --> 01:11:01,534
Uh, right there.

1304
01:12:05,097 --> 01:12:07,099
Don't wake up.
Don't wake up.

1305
01:12:07,099 --> 01:12:09,101
Don't wake up, please.

1306
01:12:10,603 --> 01:12:12,104
Thank you.

1307
01:12:14,106 --> 01:12:17,109
Oh, oh, try that one.
Try that key.

1308
01:12:17,109 --> 01:12:18,611
That's the one.

1309
01:12:18,611 --> 01:12:21,113
Try it. I know that's the one.

1310
01:12:21,113 --> 01:12:23,115
One.
One key.

1311
01:12:23,115 --> 01:12:24,617
No!

1312
01:12:24,617 --> 01:12:26,619
Oh, sorry.
Sorry.

1313
01:12:27,620 --> 01:12:30,122
One.
One key.

1314
01:12:30,122 --> 01:12:33,626
No, try the gold-colored one.

1315
01:12:33,626 --> 01:12:35,628
Shh, Big Bird.
Please!

1316
01:12:35,628 --> 01:12:37,630
Why don't you try the one
with the funny end on it?

1317
01:12:37,630 --> 01:12:39,632
Shh, Big Bird,
you'll wake them up!

1318
01:12:39,632 --> 01:12:42,635
This looks like a job for
Super Grover.

1319
01:12:42,635 --> 01:12:45,638
One more, that's uh, three keys,

1320
01:12:46,138 --> 01:12:47,640
four keys. Oh.

1321
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:48,641
I don't..

1322
01:12:48,641 --> 01:12:50,142
Shh, Big Bird.

1323
01:12:50,643 --> 01:12:53,646
Never fear, Super Grover is here!

1324
01:12:53,646 --> 01:12:56,148
We do not need a key.

1325
01:12:56,148 --> 01:12:59,151
With my super strength I will
bend the bars,

1326
01:12:59,151 --> 01:13:01,654
and birdie will be free as a bird,

1327
01:13:01,654 --> 01:13:03,656
So to speak.

1328
01:13:14,166 --> 01:13:17,169
Waaaaaah-aaah-aahhhh!

1329
01:13:23,175 --> 01:13:26,178
I don't think that's the one.

1330
01:13:26,178 --> 01:13:29,181
No, no, try the next one.

1331
01:13:29,682 --> 01:13:32,184
Are you sure you have the
right keys?

1332
01:13:32,184 --> 01:13:33,686
Psst!

1333
01:13:33,686 --> 01:13:35,688
Big Bird, how will we get you out

1334
01:13:35,688 --> 01:13:38,190
If you can't keep quiet?

1335
01:13:38,190 --> 01:13:40,693
Maybe you should ask him if
he has another set of keys.

1336
01:13:40,693 --> 01:13:42,695
Gee, Big Bird, please?

1337
01:13:45,197 --> 01:13:47,199
Maybe it's a combination lock.

1338
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:49,201
Shh!

1339
01:13:50,202 --> 01:13:51,203
Go.

1340
01:13:51,203 --> 01:13:53,706
No, don't try that one.

1341
01:13:53,706 --> 01:13:57,209
Try that one.
No, try that one.

1342
01:13:57,209 --> 01:13:59,712
No, that one.
That's the one.

1343
01:14:00,212 --> 01:14:02,214
Three.
Three more keys.

1344
01:14:02,214 --> 01:14:03,215
Ohh.

1345
01:14:03,215 --> 01:14:05,217
Wrong key.

1346
01:14:05,217 --> 01:14:08,721
Two!
Two more keys!

1347
01:14:17,730 --> 01:14:19,732
One more key.

1348
01:14:22,735 --> 01:14:24,236
That's it!

1349
01:14:26,238 --> 01:14:27,740
Big Bird!

1350
01:14:27,740 --> 01:14:29,241
Big Bird!

1351
01:14:29,241 --> 01:14:30,743
What are we gonna do?

1352
01:14:30,743 --> 01:14:31,744
They're getting away!

1353
01:14:32,244 --> 01:14:33,746
We gotta catch that truck.
Come on, Olivia. Let's go.

1354
01:14:34,246 --> 01:14:35,247
Telly, wake up Oscar.

1355
01:14:35,247 --> 01:14:37,249
Telly!

1356
01:14:37,249 --> 01:14:39,752
Right, Maria.
Oh, no!

1357
01:14:39,752 --> 01:14:41,921
Let me out of here!

1358
01:14:41,921 --> 01:14:43,422
Wait a minute.

1359
01:14:43,422 --> 01:14:44,423
What?

1360
01:14:44,423 --> 01:14:45,925
Sis, you drive.
Why me?

1361
01:14:45,925 --> 01:14:48,427
I've got an idea.

1362
01:14:48,928 --> 01:14:51,931
Olivia, Linda, help!

1363
01:14:52,431 --> 01:14:55,434
O.K., let's follow that bird.

1364
01:15:00,439 --> 01:15:02,441
Oscar! Oscar!

1365
01:15:02,441 --> 01:15:03,442
Oscar, wake up!

1366
01:15:03,943 --> 01:15:04,944
Come on.

1367
01:15:04,944 --> 01:15:07,446
Come on, oscar!
Wake up.

1368
01:15:10,950 --> 01:15:12,451
Help!

1369
01:15:12,952 --> 01:15:14,453
Help!

1370
01:15:16,455 --> 01:15:17,957
Help!

1371
01:15:18,457 --> 01:15:19,458
Help.

1372
01:15:19,959 --> 01:15:22,461
Whoa! Oh, no.
The doors are open.

1373
01:15:22,962 --> 01:15:25,464
Hey, fellas, these doors came..

1374
01:15:25,464 --> 01:15:27,967
What am I telling them for?

1375
01:15:30,469 --> 01:15:33,472
O.K., Gordon...
There he is!

1376
01:15:35,474 --> 01:15:37,476
Oh... Oh...
Who's that?

1377
01:15:37,476 --> 01:15:38,978
Who's that coming?

1378
01:15:38,978 --> 01:15:40,980
Anything following us?

1379
01:15:40,980 --> 01:15:42,982
Just a yellow volkswagen

1380
01:15:42,982 --> 01:15:44,483
with a hole in the roof and
no hood.

1381
01:15:44,984 --> 01:15:47,486
Fine. Keep an eye out for
anything suspicious.

1382
01:15:47,486 --> 01:15:48,988
Now what?

1383
01:15:48,988 --> 01:15:50,990
Just pull up behind the truck.

1384
01:15:50,990 --> 01:15:52,491
Pull up behind the truck.

1385
01:15:52,491 --> 01:15:53,993
Stay right with it.
Ok.

1386
01:15:54,493 --> 01:15:55,494
Gordon, what are you doing?

1387
01:15:55,995 --> 01:15:56,996
Are you nuts?
Get in here!

1388
01:15:56,996 --> 01:15:59,498
Gordon!

1389
01:15:59,498 --> 01:16:01,500
You know, Sid, I been thinking.

1390
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:04,503
Our big blue bird needs a new act.

1391
01:16:04,503 --> 01:16:07,006
Yeah. How about if we teach
him to dance?

1392
01:16:07,006 --> 01:16:08,507
That's a great idea!

1393
01:16:08,507 --> 01:16:10,509
We can teach him to breakdance!

1394
01:16:10,509 --> 01:16:12,511
An 8 foot blue bird breakdancing!

1395
01:16:12,511 --> 01:16:14,013
We'll get him a white glove.

1396
01:16:14,013 --> 01:16:16,015
We'll make a bundle!

1397
01:16:16,015 --> 01:16:17,516

Gordon, look.
The doors are open!

1402
01:16:27,526 --> 01:16:28,527
I know.
Now come on.

1403
01:16:29,028 --> 01:16:30,529
Come on?

1404
01:16:30,529 --> 01:16:32,531

1407
01:16:36,035 --> 01:16:38,537
I got a better idea!
How about we build a high tower

1408
01:16:38,537 --> 01:16:40,539
and have him jump into a pool
of water?

1409
01:16:40,539 --> 01:16:42,541
Jump?

1410
01:16:42,541 --> 01:16:43,542
Nah.
He's chicken.

1411
01:16:43,542 --> 01:16:47,046
Couldn't we ask them to stop
the truck?

1412
01:16:47,046 --> 01:16:49,548
Don't worry.
There's plenty of room.

1413
01:16:49,548 --> 01:16:51,550
Come on, Gordon.
Be serious.

1414
01:16:51,550 --> 01:16:52,551
Hula-hoop!

1415
01:16:53,052 --> 01:16:54,053
No!

1416
01:16:54,053 --> 01:16:56,055
Gordon, I'm not supposed to
do this!

1417
01:16:56,555 --> 01:16:59,058
You should never jump from a
moving truck.

1418
01:16:59,058 --> 01:17:02,061
I shouldn't even be standing up.

1419
01:17:02,061 --> 01:17:04,063
You have my permission this once.

1420
01:17:04,563 --> 01:17:05,564
Now come on!

1421
01:17:05,564 --> 01:17:07,566
Huh?

1422
01:17:07,566 --> 01:17:10,569
Big Bird, what are you doing?

1423
01:17:10,569 --> 01:17:12,071
Ohhh!

1424
01:17:12,071 --> 01:17:13,572
Huh?

1425
01:17:15,074 --> 01:17:18,577
Oh, O.K., Gordon.
I, ah...

1426
01:17:20,579 --> 01:17:21,580
Whew.

1427
01:17:23,082 --> 01:17:25,084
Uh, uh, uh...

1428
01:17:26,585 --> 01:17:28,587
Whoa...

1429
01:17:30,589 --> 01:17:32,591
You can do it!
Try it again!

1430
01:17:33,092 --> 01:17:34,593
Come on!

1431
01:17:34,593 --> 01:17:35,594
Got you!

1432
01:17:35,594 --> 01:17:38,097
He did it! Whoo!
Hoo hoo!

1433
01:17:38,097 --> 01:17:40,099
Oh, I knew he could do it!

1434
01:17:40,099 --> 01:17:43,102
Oh, oh, oh!
Oh, Bird!

1435
01:17:43,602 --> 01:17:44,603
Oh!

1436
01:17:46,605 --> 01:17:47,606
Oh, Bird!

1437
01:18:04,290 --> 01:18:06,292
Hey, what's that noise?

1438
01:18:08,794 --> 01:18:10,796
It's the cops!

1439
01:18:11,297 --> 01:18:12,798
Sam, the bird's gone!

1440
01:18:12,798 --> 01:18:14,300
The bird's gone!

1441
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:16,302
Get a grip on yourself, will ya!

1442
01:18:16,302 --> 01:18:18,304
Just try to relax.

1443
01:18:18,304 --> 01:18:20,806
I'll take care of everything.

1444
01:18:21,307 --> 01:18:23,809
Whatever you do, don't cry.

1445
01:18:50,836 --> 01:18:52,838
Are these the two men?

1446
01:18:54,340 --> 01:18:55,841
What seems to be the problem, officer?

1447
01:18:55,841 --> 01:18:56,842
What's the charge?

1448
01:18:56,842 --> 01:18:59,345
What about counterfeiting,

1449
01:18:59,345 --> 01:19:00,346
extortion,

1450
01:19:00,346 --> 01:19:01,847
fraud,

1451
01:19:02,348 --> 01:19:03,849
impersonating a dentist,

1452
01:19:03,849 --> 01:19:05,851
stealing an apple from a kid.

1453
01:19:05,851 --> 01:19:07,853
Oh, about that apple, Officer.

1454
01:19:07,853 --> 01:19:09,355
I can explain that.

1455
01:19:09,355 --> 01:19:11,857
We was just holding it for a friend.

1456
01:19:11,857 --> 01:19:14,860
Yeah! For a friend.

1457
01:19:14,860 --> 01:19:17,363
You can tell that to the judge.

1458
01:19:20,366 --> 01:19:21,367
The judge!

1459
01:19:21,367 --> 01:19:23,869
Be a man!

1460
01:19:23,869 --> 01:19:26,372
I don't want to be a man.

1461
01:19:26,872 --> 01:19:28,874
Shut up, Sid!
Shut up!

1462
01:19:28,874 --> 01:19:30,376
Judge, Sam.

1463
01:19:30,376 --> 01:19:31,877
Jail.

1464
01:19:33,545 --> 01:19:36,548
Big Bird is here.

1465
01:19:36,548 --> 01:19:39,551
You're right!
Let's hope he'll be here soon.

1466
01:19:39,551 --> 01:19:40,552
Look!

1467
01:19:41,553 --> 01:19:43,055
Hi, everybody.

1468
01:19:43,055 --> 01:19:46,558
Oh, I'm so happy to be back.

1469
01:19:47,059 --> 01:19:49,061
Everybody, Big Bird's back!

1470
01:19:49,061 --> 01:19:50,562
Big Bird's home!

1471
01:19:50,562 --> 01:19:52,064
Big Bird's home!

1472
01:19:52,064 --> 01:19:53,565
Big Bird!

1473
01:19:53,565 --> 01:19:56,068
Bird!
Big Bird!

1474
01:19:56,068 --> 01:19:58,070
The VW is on its way?

1475
01:19:58,070 --> 01:19:59,571
Not exactly.
What happened?

1476
01:19:59,571 --> 01:20:01,573
They had a little car trouble.

1477
01:20:01,573 --> 01:20:04,076
Tell us about your trip.

1478
01:20:04,076 --> 01:20:06,578
I had such an exciting time.

1479
01:20:06,578 --> 01:20:09,081
You know, I was on this big farm.

1480
01:20:09,081 --> 01:20:11,083
There were two little kids there,

1481
01:20:11,083 --> 01:20:12,584
and they were really nice,

1482
01:20:12,584 --> 01:20:14,086
and I was helping them do things,

1483
01:20:14,086 --> 01:20:17,089
and then suddenly,
I looked up and saw...

1484
01:20:17,089 --> 01:20:18,590
Miss Finch!

1485
01:20:18,590 --> 01:20:19,591
Hello, Bird.

1486
01:20:19,591 --> 01:20:22,594
Perhaps the Dodos weren't
perfect for you,

1487
01:20:22,594 --> 01:20:24,096
But I have managed to find you

1488
01:20:24,096 --> 01:20:26,598
another lovely bird family.

1489
01:20:26,598 --> 01:20:28,100
He doesn't need another family.

1490
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:29,601
Uh-uh.
No, no!

1491
01:20:29,601 --> 01:20:31,103
No, no, no.

1492
01:20:31,603 --> 01:20:34,106
He has one right here,

1493
01:20:34,106 --> 01:20:35,607
and we all love him.

1494
01:20:35,607 --> 01:20:38,110
Right.
For sure.

1495
01:20:38,110 --> 01:20:39,611
That's right, Big Bird!

1496
01:20:40,112 --> 01:20:41,613
But he's a bird.

1497
01:20:41,613 --> 01:20:43,615
He'd be happier with his own kind.

1498
01:20:43,615 --> 01:20:45,617
We're all happy here

1499
01:20:45,617 --> 01:20:47,619
On Sesame Street...

1500
01:20:47,619 --> 01:20:50,622
And we've got all kinds.

1501
01:20:50,622 --> 01:20:53,125
We've got people...

1502
01:20:53,625 --> 01:20:55,127
And cows...

1503
01:20:55,627 --> 01:20:57,129
She's right about that.

1504
01:20:57,629 --> 01:20:59,131
And we've got...

1505
01:20:59,131 --> 01:21:01,633
We've got Bert and Ernie...

1506
01:21:01,633 --> 01:21:03,135
Yeah.

1507
01:21:03,135 --> 01:21:05,137
We want you here, Big Bird!

1508
01:21:05,137 --> 01:21:06,638
And there's dogs...

1509
01:21:06,638 --> 01:21:08,140
Ruff! Ruff!

1510
01:21:08,140 --> 01:21:09,141
and birds.

1511
01:21:09,141 --> 01:21:10,142
That's me!

1512
01:21:10,142 --> 01:21:11,643
We've got monsters.

1513
01:21:11,643 --> 01:21:13,145
Where?
Where monsters?

1514
01:21:13,145 --> 01:21:14,646
You see monsters?

1515
01:21:14,646 --> 01:21:16,148
And kids...

1516
01:21:16,148 --> 01:21:17,149
And there's Honkers...

1517
01:21:17,149 --> 01:21:18,150
Honk! Honk!

1518
01:21:18,150 --> 01:21:20,152
Why, we've even got Grouches!

1519
01:21:20,652 --> 01:21:23,155
Keep us out of this!

1520
01:21:23,155 --> 01:21:24,656
Yeah, that's right!

1521
01:21:25,157 --> 01:21:27,659
So you have.

1522
01:21:27,659 --> 01:21:30,162
And you're all happy?

1523
01:21:30,662 --> 01:21:32,664
Yeah!
Yes, we are.

1524
01:21:32,664 --> 01:21:34,666
Yes, definitely.

1525
01:21:34,666 --> 01:21:35,667
Well...

1526
01:21:36,168 --> 01:21:38,170
You did go to look for him,

1527
01:21:38,170 --> 01:21:41,173
So that must mean you care.

1528
01:21:41,173 --> 01:21:42,674
He does seem to have

1529
01:21:42,674 --> 01:21:44,176
Lots of friends,

1530
01:21:44,176 --> 01:21:45,677
not feathered, but...

1531
01:21:45,677 --> 01:21:47,679
All right.

1532
01:21:47,679 --> 01:21:49,681
Big, from now on,

1533
01:21:49,681 --> 01:21:52,184
Sesame Street is your home.

1534
01:21:52,184 --> 01:21:55,187
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!
Oh, boy!

1535
01:21:55,187 --> 01:21:56,188
Thank you!

1536
01:21:56,188 --> 01:21:58,190
I've done it again.

1537
01:21:58,190 --> 01:21:59,691
Placed another stray bird

1538
01:21:59,691 --> 01:22:02,194
in a good home.

1539
01:22:02,194 --> 01:22:04,696
Case dismissed.
Back to work.

1540
01:22:05,197 --> 01:22:07,699
I wonder where Snuffy is.

1541
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:11,203
Would everybody excuse me for
a few minutes?

1542
01:22:11,203 --> 01:22:14,706
I've got something I should do.
Excuse me, ok?

1543
01:22:15,207 --> 01:22:16,708
See ya.

1544
01:22:19,211 --> 01:22:20,712
Bye, Big.

1545
01:22:25,717 --> 01:22:27,219
Snuffy!

1546
01:22:31,723 --> 01:22:33,225
Snuffy?

1547
01:22:34,726 --> 01:22:37,729
Oh, Bird!

1548
01:22:37,729 --> 01:22:39,231
Oh!

1549
01:22:39,231 --> 01:22:42,234
Oh, Snuffy, this time you're real.

1550
01:22:42,234 --> 01:22:43,735
Oh, Bird,

1551
01:22:43,735 --> 01:22:47,239
Can I stop watching your things now?

1552
01:22:47,239 --> 01:22:49,741
Ha ha ha!
Oh, Snuffy.

1553
01:22:49,741 --> 01:22:52,244
Oh, Bird.

1554
01:22:52,244 --> 01:22:54,746
Ah... Home at last.

1555
01:22:57,249 --> 01:23:00,252
I hope nothing's seriously
wrong with your car.

1556
01:23:00,252 --> 01:23:02,754
I hope not, either,
but I can fix it.

1557
01:23:05,757 --> 01:23:06,758
Oh, Gordon!

1558
01:23:07,259 --> 01:23:08,760
Never in my life...

1559
01:23:09,261 --> 01:23:10,762
Gordon, what's going on?

1560
01:23:11,263 --> 01:23:13,265
What happened to your car?

1561
01:23:13,765 --> 01:23:14,766
Gordon...

1562
01:23:14,766 --> 01:23:16,768
Gordon!

1563
01:23:18,270 --> 01:23:20,772
What happened to the car?

1564
01:23:20,772 --> 01:23:23,275
Don't ask me, ask him.

1565
01:23:23,275 --> 01:23:24,276
Hi.

1566
01:23:25,277 --> 01:23:26,778
Excuse me.

1567
01:23:26,778 --> 01:23:29,781
Our insurance man won't
believe this.

1568
01:23:29,781 --> 01:23:30,782
Ruff ruff!

1569
01:23:30,782 --> 01:23:32,784
Once more around the block, Bruno.

1570
01:23:32,784 --> 01:23:33,785
Sure, boss.

1571
01:23:34,286 --> 01:23:37,789
Yeah, I got to walk off
some of this happy stuff.

1572
01:23:42,794 --> 01:23:44,296
Bruno, come on.

1573
01:24:02,314 --> 01:24:04,650
Wait, wait! Wait!
Don't leave yet.

1574
01:24:04,650 --> 01:24:07,653
My favorite part of the picture
is starting..

1575
01:24:08,153 --> 01:24:09,655
The credits.

1576
01:24:09,655 --> 01:24:12,157
I love to count credits.

1577
01:24:14,159 --> 01:24:16,161
One "Directed by."

1578
01:24:16,161 --> 01:24:18,163
That's one credit.

1579
01:24:18,163 --> 01:24:19,665
Ha ha ha!

1580
01:24:19,665 --> 01:24:21,667
One "Written by."

1581
01:24:21,667 --> 01:24:23,669
That's two credits.

1582
01:24:24,670 --> 01:24:26,672
One "Produced by."

1583
01:24:26,672 --> 01:24:29,174
That's three credits.

1584
01:24:30,175 --> 01:24:32,678
One "Director of photography."

1585
01:24:32,678 --> 01:24:35,180
That's four credits.

1586
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:37,683
Ah.
One "Art director."

1587
01:24:38,183 --> 01:24:41,186
That's five fabulous credits!

1588
01:24:41,687 --> 01:24:43,188
One "Associate producer."

1589
01:24:43,188 --> 01:24:46,191
Somebody must associate with
the producer.

1590
01:24:46,191 --> 01:24:49,194
Ha ha ha!
I love it.

1591
01:24:49,194 --> 01:24:51,196
That's six credits.

1592
01:24:51,196 --> 01:24:53,699
One "Supervising Film Editor."

1593
01:24:53,699 --> 01:24:56,702
That's seven stupefying credits!

1594
01:24:56,702 --> 01:24:58,704
One "Music score by."

1595
01:24:58,704 --> 01:25:01,206
That's eight credits!

1596
01:25:01,206 --> 01:25:03,709
One "Music supervised by."

1597
01:25:03,709 --> 01:25:05,210
Nine credits!

1598
01:25:05,210 --> 01:25:06,712
Ha!

1599
01:25:06,712 --> 01:25:08,714
One "Joan Ganz Cooney!"

1600
01:25:08,714 --> 01:25:09,715
Hi, Mom.

1601
01:25:10,215 --> 01:25:11,216
That's 10!

1602
01:25:11,216 --> 01:25:14,219
10 fantastic credits,
and still counting!

1603
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:16,221
I love it!
