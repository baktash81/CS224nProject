1
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:25,880
Why couldn't she have been
a fucking smoker?

2
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:29,786
This has nothing to do with
her being in such wonderful shape.

3
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,355
The cause of our trouble
was our inability to come up with a drug...

4
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:37,226
...short of paint thinner, that would be
at least somewhat novel to her system.

5
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,956
She's built up a tolerance to everything.

6
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:43,197
A tolerance?
She's taking her fucking afternoon nap.

7
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:44,529
Shut up, lgby!

8
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:46,327
We're fine.

9
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:04,079
It's all the fucking tennis.

10
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:17,627
It's almost 6:00.

11
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:31,275
Igby.

12
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:37,341
They'll do it. I don't know what it is,
but I know they'll do it.

13
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:41,217
-Let's all drink to Bay State--
-Let's drink to Julia. Have you met her yet?

14
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:43,255
If she's anything like her sister....

15
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:48,557
We'll drink to Johnny and Julia and Bay
State Power and love and happiness and....

16
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:50,896
Here you are.

17
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:53,432
For the love of Pete,
it's the Witch and Dopey.

18
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:57,694
I've never been up here before.
It's awfully quaint, isn't it?

19
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:58,862
We like it.

20
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:01,799
Dad, when are you going back to work?

21
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:04,602
Soon.

22
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:07,036
-You're not really sick anymore.
-No.

23
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,707
Not really sick.

24
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:13,718
But not completely well.
Not yet, I don't think.

25
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:17,479
-When will you be better?
-ln the spring.

26
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,625
-The spring?
-I'm no good in the winter.

27
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,755
These gray days...

28
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,128
...they're so sad.

29
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,765
What about next winter?

30
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:56,528
Jason, tell me, dearest,
are you planning on bathing this week?

31
00:04:57,196 --> 00:04:58,356
I beg your pardon?

32
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,524
It seems to have slipped
your mind last week.

33
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,034
-But I'm not dirty.
-No...

34
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:08,271
...dirty, I mean, you've done nothing that'd
make you dirty for quite some time now.

35
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,342
But you do reek, darling,
of tobacco, from your...

36
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:15,711
...yellow toenails to your yellow fingernails
to your yellow teeth...

37
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,545
...to your yellow hair.

38
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:20,618
Sorry to have offended.

39
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,078
Me?

40
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,519
A piece of gristle.

41
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:31,825
Not on an empty stomach, dear.

42
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:40,870
Excuse me.

43
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:14,030
Boys, your mother was quite right
to have chastised me.

44
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:18,109
Good personal hygiene...

45
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:22,876
...is one of the most essential disciplines
a man can have...

46
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:25,076
...in this world.

47
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:27,616
Chin-chin!

48
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:44,164
Don't indulge him anymore.

49
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,797
How can anyone be afraid of a clown?

50
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:48,367
Just leave him.

51
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:52,434
C'mon, old man.
This is no way to be on your birthday.

52
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,075
Everybody's gone home.

53
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:03,053
There's nobody left downstairs.
It's just you and me, now.

54
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:07,381
Hey.

55
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:12,022
It's just you and me, old man.

56
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,783
If Heaven is such a wonderful place...

57
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,291
...then how was getting crucified
such a big fucking sacrifice?

58
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:54,303
Mrs. Slocumb,
it's wonderful to see you again.

59
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:55,768
I hope you drove.

60
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:59,141
No more beautiful place on God's earth...

61
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,442
...than Connecticut at Christmas time.

62
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:04,642
-Oliver drove me down from the city.
-Please.

63
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:08,451
Congratulations on Oliver.

64
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:11,115
I hear he's already established himself...

65
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,182
...as the cream of
the Columbia freshman crop.

66
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:18,356
We do take a lot of pride
in seeing our boys succeed.

67
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:21,161
But of course, we're here to discuss...

68
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:22,696
...Igby.

69
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:30,040
Honor roll? You flunked everything.
Not even a 'D' in art this time.

70
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:32,873
-Did you enjoy making me look like a fool?
-I dunno.

71
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,172
You don't know?

72
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:37,339
Poor Mrs. Slocumb doesn't have a clue
what old lgby is up to.

73
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,351
-Dithering, foolish lady. Did you enjoy that?
-I dunno.

74
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:42,545
-I beg your pardon?
-No!

75
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:46,023
Then what are you? A pathological liar?

76
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:47,683
I don't know.

77
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,285
You don't know? Liar! You little liar!

78
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:54,697
How dare you! And where were you when
your brother was flunking out of school?

79
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:56,257
I was in college.

80
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:58,496
Igby is not my fault.

81
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:02,997
Did you even, for a second...

82
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:05,134
...think about how this reflects upon me?

83
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:06,769
No.

84
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:13,214
I am not going to go through this again.
You had a chance. You flunked everything.

85
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:15,481
That's almost impressive. It really is.

86
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,921
You know what's going to
happen to you now, mister?

87
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:22,222
Do you know where your sterling
performance is going to take you now...

88
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:25,020
...Iittle man?

89
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,994
Choate?

90
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:33,628
-Cadet report!
-Oh, shit!

91
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:35,974
Second watch is early.

92
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,034
Lights out!

93
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,704
In your bunks!

94
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:45,140
You heard him. Let's go!

95
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:49,453
All right, Mr. Patterson, lights out!

96
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,183
What part of "lights out"
don't you understand?

97
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,720
-Turtle! The spray!
-ln your bunk, Mistletoe!

98
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,700
All right, Fredrick, you know the rules.

99
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,670
Turtle!

100
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,941
Both of you, lights out! In your bunks!

101
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:46,907
This is your godfather, Igby.
Are you listening to me?

102
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:51,109
This is the best thing that could have
happened to you, military school.

103
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:55,051
To get out of that comfortable world
you were raised in. Strike out on your own.

104
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:59,057
You know those East Coast country club
schools do you no good in the real world.

105
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:02,087
It might be tough now,
but it's gonna make you tough.

106
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:05,426
Unlike the rest
of your coddled contemporaries.

107
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:06,890
Fire!

108
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,505
And lgby goes down.

109
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:23,479
I bet you've made some real buddies.

110
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:25,376
Haven't you?

111
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:28,579
Igby has buddies.

112
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:30,746
-Haven't you got buddies?
-Many.

113
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:33,553
You have that buddy
with the cute little name.

114
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:37,323
-That little buddy, Tortoise.
-Turtle.

115
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:39,792
Turtle?

116
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,057
Turtle.

117
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:42,395
He was my best buddy.

118
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,197
Then his rifle backfired
and blew his face off.

119
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:48,339
We all learned a lesson
about weapon maintenance that day.

120
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:49,999
Why didn't the school inform me?

121
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:51,668
It wasn't the school's fault.

122
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:53,411
They were great about it.

123
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,606
Paid for the dry-cleaning and everything.

124
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:57,171
Not because they had to...

125
00:11:57,249 --> 00:12:00,412
...but because it was the right thing to do.

126
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:06,018
I believe that certain people in life
are meant to fall by the wayside...

127
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:09,887
...to serve as warnings for the rest of us.
Signposts along the way.

128
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:10,986
To where?

129
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:14,660
Success.

130
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:20,262
Our father would be a "slippery when
schizophrenic" sign, for instance.

131
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,409
Along the highway of life.

132
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,569
This summer...

133
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,209
...I want you to come and work for me.

134
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:35,714
Work with my crew.
Renovate some of my New York properties.

135
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:39,620
You up to bein' exploited
by your old pal this summer?

136
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:47,162
-What do you say?
-Stay at your Hamptons summer house?

137
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:50,029
-On the weekends.
-I'm your man, sir.

138
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:51,534
Good!

139
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:56,868
-When are you headed back to the academy?
-0700 tomorrow morning, sir.

140
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:27,532
Sorry.

141
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:43,887
"This letter is to inform you,
the recipient, that my son...

142
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,415
"...the bearer of this letter...

143
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:50,519
-"...has permission to use my credit card--"
-You can take your break now, Kevin.

144
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:51,654
Thank you.

145
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:54,459
-May I help you, son?
-I need a room.

146
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,327
And you have a reservation?

147
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:59,530
-I assume my mother made one.
-Under her name?

148
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,635
-This is your mother?
-Yep.

149
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,013
No reservation under that name.

150
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:12,511
That is so typical.

151
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:15,713
-ln town looking at schools, are you?
-Colleges.

152
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:20,015
She had to fly home. I have a brother,
a teenager. Bit of a problem.

153
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:22,053
Every family has one.

154
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:25,260
What colleges are you lookin' at, son?

155
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:26,931
All of 'em, really.

156
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,926
Just so long as it's here.
Here in the Midwest.

157
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,129
I hear ya.

158
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:39,102
Hello, is Georgie there? He isn't?

159
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:43,409
This is Mr. Slocumb,
Georgie's favorite teacher from the academy.

160
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:45,515
Who are you?

161
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,713
Really? I didn't know Georgie had a sister.

162
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:51,286
I'm in town for a little while...

163
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:53,723
...at the O'Hare Hilton.

164
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:58,227
Listen, what are you up to?

165
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:04,126
But I'm an incredibly cool
and young teacher.

166
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:07,806
Why? How old are you?

167
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:11,101
Really?

168
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:13,469
You sound older than 11.

169
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:17,206
You're right. It's probably the cigarettes.

170
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:20,845
Hello?

171
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:22,248
Mimi Slocumb, please.

172
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:23,618
This is she.

173
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,452
I'm calling from the O'Hare Hilton.

174
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:46,408
Hi.

175
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:50,078
You can stand at attention there, Slocumb.

176
00:15:56,689 --> 00:16:01,023
What exactly
do you think you're doing here?

177
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:04,820
The Ritz-Carlton was full.

178
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:10,662
You know I'm very tense these days,
very anxious about all of lgby's trouble.

179
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:15,435
My son in drug camp, for God's sake,
and then you make me so very cross.

180
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:19,671
And I take the trouble to tell you
specifically what I require...

181
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:21,679
-...a half a grapefruit and--
-Mimi.

182
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:23,009
Let's....

183
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,573
Let's get off the maid.

184
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:26,811
Help!

185
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,853
Super Cadet
has got this big smile on his face.

186
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:32,786
No one takes him seriously.

187
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:35,920
No one knows
that he's been expelled that morning.

188
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:38,191
They scream...

189
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:40,958
..."jump," and surprise...

190
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:43,365
...he does a swan dive onto the pavement.

191
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:47,962
You can still see the stain in the pavement
where his head popped open.

192
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:53,408
Every morning, I used that blotch to know
where to line up for breakfast formation.

193
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,306
Do you contemplate suicide?

194
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:57,775
Constantly.

195
00:16:57,983 --> 00:17:00,508
You totally missed the point of my story.

196
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:02,383
-Have l?
-Completely.

197
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:06,083
It's about the hypocrisy of the place,
which I couldn't tolerate.

198
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:09,093
You let me do my job, and you do yours.

199
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:10,753
I'm trying to fucking help you.

200
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,660
-You think I need help?
-Apparently.

201
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:16,132
You think that I don't know
how to do my job?

202
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:20,194
No offense, but how good could you be,
working at this place?

203
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:24,003
You know, I can only be as effective
as you allow me to be.

204
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:26,010
Just tried to help you with my story.

205
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,706
How did you feel about what the boy did?

206
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:33,741
I feel like he should've really reconsidered
his fucking options, don't you?

207
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:36,344
-What are your options?
-I don't know yet.

208
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,952
Who were you trying to hurt with the pills?

209
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:43,484
Nobody. I was improvising as I went.
I actually didn't give it a lot of thought.

210
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:47,293
I think that you are much more aware
than even you realize.

211
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:50,891
Yeah? Well, you're an idiot, so--

212
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,494
What the fuck are you doing?

213
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,233
I don't like being called an idiot.

214
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:57,673
You prick! You can't fucking hit me!

215
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:04,113
Next fall, you'll be starting
at yet another school.

216
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:06,877
Are you gonna try to make an effort
this time around?

217
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:14,217
I'm considering my options.

218
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:20,555
Am I to understand you have four separate
doctors, all writing you prescriptions?

219
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:21,826
It's a point of convenience.

220
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,494
With no knowledge
of what the others are prescribing!

221
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,697
My dear man, I assure you,
I need my peppies.

222
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,900
Perhaps if you cut down on the Valium
and the sleeping pills...

223
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:33,001
-...you'd have more energy.
-Without them I get very tense.

224
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:36,411
You get tense
because you pop speed like candy.

225
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:40,709
-Bad Mrs. Slocumb.
-I beg your pardon.

226
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:44,847
Patients actually tolerate
this cheeky-little-shit routine of yours?

227
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:46,652
Find it cute, do they?

228
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:49,027
-Mrs. Slocumb--
-Out!

229
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,036
-I'm not well.
-You mean literally?

230
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:02,300
Yes, literally. They've run tests.

231
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:05,533
This doesn't seem so bad.

232
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:09,138
As nice a place as any to spend the spring.
Round out your rough edges.

233
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:10,511
This'll do for ya.

234
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:14,245
I still want you
to come and work for me this summer.

235
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:17,512
Stay with Bunny and me
at the summer house. What do you think?

236
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:20,953
Now, listen, the reason that Mimi...

237
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,988
...your mother, hasn't been able to...

238
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:27,455
...visit you.... I'm sure she wanted to.
She went to the...

239
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:31,697
...hospital for a bit of a rest,
and they discovered something else.

240
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,466
Something rather bad.

241
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:38,704
She's getting treatment for it. Everybody's
damn confident she'll be fine, but....

242
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:41,303
You know what mastectomy is?

243
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:45,777
Your house....

244
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:47,585
It's on the beach, right?

245
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,450
Contract.

246
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:54,651
It's a contract. See,
families should be run like companies...

247
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:58,218
...with everybody's responsibilities
clearly defined.

248
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:00,322
Children, at the age of reason...

249
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:04,233
...should be provided with legal
representation and a contract drawn up.

250
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:07,405
All the best relationships
are based on contracts.

251
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:09,702
Bunny and I have a contract.

252
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:12,039
Now that you're gonna come
and work for me...

253
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,771
...we're gonna have one.

254
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:17,843
And that piece of paper is your clean slate.

255
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:27,290
You know, you could just
take a later shuttle back to DC.

256
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,589
I'm past the worst of it, I think.

257
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:34,856
I'm meeting that dean
from St. Anthony's, McKaye...

258
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:38,896
...in the morning,
to beg him to admit your brother this fall.

259
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:41,163
A mother's work is never done.

260
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,868
-D.H. is collecting lgby today?
-Yeah.

261
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,709
He's picking him up from "the camp."

262
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:50,441
What a great investment
that has proven to be.

263
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:55,784
Getting to hear, for two months,
on a weekly basis...

264
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:57,879
...just how much my son hates me.

265
00:20:57,956 --> 00:21:00,925
That's always been
one of his favorite topics of conversation.

266
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:05,157
His creation was an act of animosity.
Why shouldn't his life be one?

267
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:16,169
Listen, Ollie, this summer, lgby's going to
bunk with you at Columbia during the week.

268
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:18,471
You both can go to the Hamptons
on the weekends.

269
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:20,067
Of course.

270
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:23,012
I'll baby-sit lgby all summer long.

271
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:26,278
You know, you have been
a very bad older brother.

272
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:31,421
And yet you're the one he hates.

273
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,921
Basically, it's like reverse Darwinism.

274
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:40,931
A situation in which
a less evolved species...

275
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:44,901
...is better equipped to survive
than a more evolved creature.

276
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:50,139
Which, if you think about it,
isn't really reverse Darwinism, so much as...

277
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,472
...bigger-picture Darwinism, if you will.

278
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:54,771
What?

279
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:07,815
-Tommy?
-Yeah.

280
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:10,953
What's happening?
Did you hear that? We were out there for....

281
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:14,521
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

282
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:17,397
Did you hear the locks? It needs oil...

283
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:19,300
-...or something.
-I'll fix that.

284
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:23,740
Look at this guy. Look at this strapping
young working hunk of manhood.

285
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:25,970
That's my godson, lgby.

286
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:28,439
Ever hear that name, "lgby"?

287
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,972
It's funny. You met his brother
at the office the other day.

288
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:35,014
How you doin'?

289
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:36,281
Good.

290
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:42,793
How you doin'?

291
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:45,456
You're doin' "well."

292
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,933
How's the work comin' along there, stud?

293
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:57,366
-Well?
-Do we need this wall?

294
00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:00,173
Three thousand square feet over!

295
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:05,516
You got the new plumbing.
What do you call, risers, so we have very....

296
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:07,381
We've got 27 windows.

297
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,354
What are you doing, you little reptile?

298
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:13,813
Look at this.

299
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,403
Hi, honey!

300
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:20,852
It's not that cold out here.

301
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:22,754
No.

302
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:25,191
Who are you?

303
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,556
Sookie.

304
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:29,099
-Sookie?
-Sookie Sapperstein.

305
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:30,293
Yeah?

306
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,061
Yeah.

307
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,767
Are you somebody's daughter?

308
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:39,570
I'm somebody's daughter.

309
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,509
I mean somebody here at this party.

310
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,438
No.

311
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:45,339
Then why are you here?

312
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:48,280
I'm with the catering company.

313
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:50,220
The woman hired us for the party.

314
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:52,552
Why do you think I'm dressed
like a figure skater?

315
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:56,386
Bunny hired you.

316
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:58,385
She's my godmother.

317
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:03,693
Actually, she's not.
Her husband, D.H. Banes...

318
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:05,536
...he's my godfather.

319
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:07,765
Are those cloves?

320
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,033
Outstanding! Can I bum one?

321
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,104
No.

322
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:21,884
Got a light?

323
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,388
And a cigarette?

324
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:38,361
Rachel, I see you've met the boys.

325
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:39,763
We've already met.

326
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:42,739
Bunny, Rachel is the choreographer
I was telling you about...

327
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:47,403
...who's renting that commercial space
from us down in SoHo, using it as a studio.

328
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:49,470
-Remember?
-How wonderful.

329
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:52,149
Boys....

330
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,112
It's so wonderful you could come and stay.

331
00:25:58,757 --> 00:26:02,124
-lgby, I could just eat you with a spoon.
-Don't.

332
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:07,389
-Now, when did you get out of camp?
-Two months ago.

333
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:11,026
I've been working for D.H. all summer.
That's why I'm here every weekend.

334
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:14,594
My wife is the philanthropist of the family.

335
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:16,834
Especially fond of dance, aren't you dear?

336
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,376
D.H., look. Pull around.

337
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:20,836
Here we go.

338
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:25,679
-We have guests behind us.
-The guests. I see.

339
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:30,081
Are you two in school or something?

340
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:33,687
I'm at Columbia,
and as far as this year's challenge for lgby...

341
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:37,489
...we're still waiting to hear back
from this fun parochial school in DC.

342
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:40,531
-"Perchance to dream."
-He's done the Protestant circuit.

343
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:44,262
Mom must have some photos of the
head priest with an altar boy for them...

344
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:46,031
...to even be considering lgby.

345
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:51,399
-We're all at a bit of a loss as to--
-Whenever I'm at a loss, I dip into Rilke.

346
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:56,147
Rilke? That tortures me.

347
00:26:56,481 --> 00:26:59,973
Every Christmas, some asshole
gives me this copy of Young Poet...

348
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:04,283
...with this patronizing note on the flap
about how it's supposed to change my life.

349
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:07,917
-Maybe you should read it before judging it.
-I'm pretty confident.

350
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:10,223
After all, one of the copies was from you.

351
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:13,464
I'm Oliver, and this is my little brother, lgby.

352
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:15,226
What kind of a name is "lgby"?

353
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:19,326
It's the kind of a name that someone
named Sookie is in no position to question.

354
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:20,462
Sookie?

355
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:23,139
-Where do you go to school?
-Bennington.

356
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:25,403
Ollie's majoring in Neo-Fascism
at Columbia.

357
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,240
-Economics.
-Semantics.

358
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:29,573
-What's your major?
-Attitude.

359
00:27:30,448 --> 00:27:33,315
-I've gotta get back to the bar.
-That's where I'm headed.

360
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:35,376
Catch you kids later.

361
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,959
D.H. brings you up a lot.

362
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:44,018
-Captain Charisma is my godfather.
-I know.

363
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:47,064
So, if something horrible, God forbid...

364
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:50,226
...were to befall my mother,
I would live with him and Bunny.

365
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:53,668
-I know what godparents are.
-You're ripping apart my potential home.

366
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:57,469
-My being here offends you?
-Your being here is great.

367
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:01,145
-I had no choice.
-No, really. I think you're great.

368
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:02,201
Thank you.

369
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:04,915
It's him bringing you here that tortures me.

370
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:09,143
I love the fact that the captain
of the morality team invites his chick...

371
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:13,748
...to the same party as his wife, who isn't
the sharpest tool in the shed anymore.

372
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:18,194
And what's more, none of their supposed
mutual friends protects her.

373
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:22,790
None of them bats a fucking eyelash
at his hypocrisy. I love that, I really do.

374
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:26,200
Embrace your moral hypocrisy,
D.H. Go for it.

375
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,875
-But me you're okay with.
-Honestly.

376
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,678
Listen, you know what?

377
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:38,473
If you're ever in the city,
you should pop by the loft.

378
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:40,881
We're done working on it.

379
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:44,077
I know.

380
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,316
No worries, Mother.
Igby is on his way to the airport.

381
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:15,644
The driver's been briefed
to take him directly to LaGuardia.

382
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,814
He'll be in St. Anthony's loving custody
by this afternoon.

383
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:22,359
And happy birthday, Mother.

384
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:24,358
Much love.

385
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:25,888
Sir?

386
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:29,291
It's my mother's birthday today, and I forgot.

387
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:32,392
Is there any way that...

388
00:29:32,637 --> 00:29:34,070
...we could just...

389
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:36,903
...make a quick stop
in the city somewhere, so...

390
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,769
...I can get her something?

391
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:40,741
She'd be so surprised.

392
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:06,669
Can I help you?

393
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:08,297
Hey.

394
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,167
You remember me?
From the Hamptons John Birch Cotillion.

395
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:16,111
Yeah. How you doin'?

396
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:18,180
Come on in.

397
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:22,016
So, you said you'd come by and you did.
A month later.

398
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:27,023
-Love what you've done with the space.
-I love what the space has done to her.

399
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:30,159
-lgby.
-This is my friend, Russel.

400
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:31,490
-Hi.
-Hi.

401
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:34,493
-lgby is D.H.'s....
-Godson.

402
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,396
-Russel's just--
-What?

403
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:42,362
He's just a brilliant artist.

404
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:45,399
So, what are you doing here?

405
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:46,534
Celebrating.

406
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:48,904
St. Anthony's accepted me.

407
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:51,473
Congratulations?

408
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,945
I'm on the lam.

409
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:56,881
-You want to stay here?
-lf there's enough room.

410
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:58,889
You can't stay here.

411
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:02,688
I don't even live here.
I rent this space to work in. I work here.

412
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:05,318
I pay rent.
D.H. doesn't even know you're here?

413
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:06,920
It's kind of awkward.

414
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:08,154
Great.

415
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:12,062
I don't know what you're gonna do,
because there isn't an extra key...

416
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:14,832
...and only D.H. can get them made, so....

417
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:24,708
There's an extra key on the windowsill
in the hallway, the landing outside the door.

418
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:26,943
But it has to be here when D.H. needs it.

419
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:29,350
-Why would D.H. need it?
-Fuck you!

420
00:31:29,787 --> 00:31:32,312
You can stay here for a couple days
and that's it.

421
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:36,959
Contrary to popular belief,
D.H. is my landlord.

422
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:40,259
I'm an established artist. I work here.
My projects are supported.

423
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:44,495
I can't afford to fuck up my relationship
with my landlord. Do you understand?

424
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,127
So, let yourself in and out...

425
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:48,570
...with the key,
but each time he reaches for it...

426
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,369
-...it's there waiting for him.
-Sure.

427
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:53,706
I don't wanna know you're here
or see any traces of you in here.

428
00:31:53,778 --> 00:31:54,802
Gotcha.

429
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:56,369
For a couple of days.

430
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,618
I'm just gonna run to the bathroom.

431
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:05,886
So, you're an artist?

432
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,488
What kind of art?

433
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:12,961
What do you mean, "what kind of art"?

434
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:14,760
I mean do you paint, or what?

435
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:18,290
I got what you meant,
but you obviously didn't get what I meant.

436
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:22,801
An artist creates art,
regardless of what form the canvas takes.

437
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:26,310
-So, what do you do? Paint?
-I'm a performance artist.

438
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:28,277
So, you don't paint.

439
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:33,851
Rachel thinks that D.H. is going to...

440
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:37,649
-...Ieave his wifey and set up house with her.
-Shut the fuck up, Russel!

441
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:40,190
What do you think the chances of that are?

442
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:42,624
Moneybuckets, take me away!

443
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:49,156
Could you persuade your godfather
into letting me use one of his buildings...

444
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:50,766
...for one of my pieces?

445
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:53,360
-What would you want to do with it?
-I don't know.

446
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:55,406
Russel is just, like...

447
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,105
...very brilliant.

448
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:06,383
-How old are you?
-I'm 18.

449
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:09,917
I'm very close to being 18.

450
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:17,358
-Still no news on lgby?
-No.

451
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:19,224
He will turn up.

452
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:20,691
D.H. is...

453
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:24,867
...spending more time in New York these
days than here in Georgetown, so...

454
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,963
...he is bound to find him.

455
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:30,337
You know, listen,
I just want you to know that if you should...

456
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:32,569
...take a very bad turn...

457
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:37,813
...death, for instance....
Not to worry about the boys.

458
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:41,579
D.H. was so excited
about having them this summer...

459
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:44,815
...and, you know,
if we could be surrogates...

460
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:49,292
...and help the boys in any way,
you know that would make us very happy.

461
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,851
I just want you to know that.

462
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:55,558
Not to mention the fact that he's....
Over the years, he's invested...

463
00:33:55,633 --> 00:34:00,570
...an awful lot emotionally
and, well, financially into the boys.

464
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:03,474
Igby's tuition and such.

465
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,509
I mean, where else would you turn?

466
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:07,210
Jason?

467
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,341
Handsome.

468
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:12,211
-Handsome, sad Jason...
-Shut up.

469
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:15,548
...who so depleted your finances
and your options.

470
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:18,646
I mean, the sacrifices
you've made to the boys...

471
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:21,453
...I'm just, well, how....

472
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:24,290
-How did you do it?
-Stirrups and a turkey baster.

473
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:37,974
-Bunny?
-Yeah?

474
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,871
You are a feeble woman.

475
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:57,458
Did I hear Mimi?

476
00:34:58,396 --> 00:34:59,886
She's just freshening up.

477
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:01,326
She's freshening up?

478
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,392
Mimi?

479
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,997
Did she leave, D.H.?

480
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,568
Without saying goodbye?

481
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:10,230
She did leave a note.

482
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:12,339
Of course she did.

483
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:13,940
Sweet Mimi!

484
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,516
Can't you hit D.H. up for some bucks?

485
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:24,449
I'd ask him myself,
but I'm not having sex with him.

486
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:27,047
-Fuck you. Get a job.
-Please!

487
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:30,183
Things have become fragile with D.H.

488
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,195
What things?

489
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:34,722
Me.

490
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:36,225
Russel!

491
00:35:39,203 --> 00:35:42,366
You're not even paying rent.
All you really need is pocket cash.

492
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,702
I have needs.

493
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:46,174
Russel's always looking for assistants
for projects.

494
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:49,077
I'm sure he'd throw you work
as a favor to me. He loves me.

495
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,377
Where the fuck are you?

496
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:53,178
On one of his artworks?

497
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:56,553
-Shit!
-Catch!

498
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:17,672
I know you. You're that boy
from the Hamptons party.

499
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:20,702
Iggy?

500
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:24,175
I met you at your uncle's party.

501
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:27,112
Igby. He's my godfather. Leave me alone.

502
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:29,277
Igby.

503
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,644
What?

504
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:31,983
Dime bag.

505
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,589
That got your attention.

506
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:38,990
Pavlov's pothead.

507
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:42,299
I hear the sound of a bong clink
and my eyes begin to water.

508
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,833
That's funny.

509
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:46,493
Thanks.

510
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:48,332
The park?

511
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:49,631
Yeah.

512
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:54,505
You can't guard me, Mindy!

513
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:57,073
C'mon, where'd it go?

514
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:58,439
Oh, shit!

515
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:01,144
-You bitch!
-My ball, cuntface!

516
00:37:06,924 --> 00:37:09,859
-Are you a vegetarian?
-Why would you ask that?

517
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:13,019
I've just never seen anybody
roll a joint like that.

518
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:15,897
What does that have to do
with being a vegetarian?

519
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:17,935
They're just so precious.

520
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:20,526
I roll perfect joints.

521
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:23,999
-I'm not putting them down. They're great.
-Thank you.

522
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:27,875
It's incredible that a human being
could make such neat little joints.

523
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:30,140
You make it sound as if
I'm anal or something.

524
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:33,377
-Just because I can roll a perfect joint.
-Not anal.

525
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:35,841
Vegetarian.

526
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,319
What does that mean?

527
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:41,484
You don't roll
big Rasta spliff joints, do you?

528
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:45,086
Your joints are like salad joints,
not like a big...

529
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:49,599
...sloppy, bleeding-cheeseburger-
that-you-rip-into-kind-of-a-joint joint.

530
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:55,004
I guess marijuana
isn't a visceral experience for me.

531
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:58,037
-Sex is for me.
-Right.

532
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,976
Okay, so I am a vegetarian.
But for purely moral reasons.

533
00:38:08,252 --> 00:38:10,948
I thought you went to school
at Brandeis or someplace.

534
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:12,546
Bennington. I do.

535
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:15,615
-Why aren't you there?
-I took a semester off.

536
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,191
I needed time to recuperate.

537
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:19,627
From what?

538
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:25,600
Entenmann's cookies,
beer, diet pills, tension...

539
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,569
...Iife.

540
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:30,603
My dad's been recuperating for six years.

541
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:32,735
What do you mean?

542
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:35,435
From life. Nothing.

543
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:39,374
Let's go.

544
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:44,321
You've come a long way, baby.

545
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:49,092
You're funny.

546
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:08,209
Hello, I'm Lt. Ernest Smith
from Pershing Academy.

547
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:11,339
-I'm here to ask about a--
-Those are fabulous.

548
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:13,843
-Where did you get them?
-The army.

549
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,482
See, I'm regular army.

550
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:19,111
Mrs. Slocumb found out
I was stationed in New Jersey now...

551
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:23,718
...so she just thought that maybe lgby,
since he worked here this summer....

552
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:25,728
Can I have these?

553
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,799
No.

554
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:34,599
I'm asking about lgby Slocumb!

555
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:41,374
Anne Frank, the soldiers are gone.
Come out and play.

556
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:53,782
Yum, with three "M"s.

557
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:59,990
You have a huge crush on me, don't you?

558
00:40:00,264 --> 00:40:01,288
Fuck off.

559
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:05,134
How's your brother doing these days?

560
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:09,069
-I don't have a brother. I'm an only child.
-Oliver's your brother, I thought.

561
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,301
-He is, and yet....
-And yet what?

562
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:14,503
I was about to say that we were
both raised only children, but...

563
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:16,910
...that sounds like something
you would say.

564
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:19,005
What do you do?

565
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,977
I'm preparing to leave.

566
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,549
Where do you want to go?

567
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:24,449
Far away.

568
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:27,750
I was thinking
about joining the Peace Corps.

569
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:30,559
Go on my Razor's Edge experience.

570
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:32,253
Discover the meaning of life.

571
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,192
Whatever.

572
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:37,928
You need at least three years of college
to join the Peace Corps, don't you?

573
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:39,026
You do?

574
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:41,600
Yeah. I had a friend at school who joined.

575
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,907
That could be a slight snag.

576
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:46,442
I haven't even gotten around
to taking my GED yet.

577
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:49,035
-So take it.
-I gotta go to Hackensack.

578
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:52,478
So go! Stop procrastinating.
It's almost Christmas.

579
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:56,943
Not going to New Jersey isn't
procrastinating. It's common sense.

580
00:40:57,555 --> 00:40:59,546
-Do you want me to go with you?
-No.

581
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:01,084
I will.

582
00:41:04,328 --> 00:41:05,818
All right, that'd be great.

583
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,828
Why aren't you in school now?

584
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,557
Sheer ingenuity.

585
00:41:10,701 --> 00:41:12,168
You're funny.

586
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:16,606
Instead of saying
that someone or something is funny...

587
00:41:17,007 --> 00:41:19,032
...why don't you just laugh?

588
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,243
-ls that better?
-Much.

589
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:29,848
-Gosh, I've never been to a hideout before.
-Shut up.

590
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,739
My boy...

591
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,681
...you look a bit...

592
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:02,943
...peaked.

593
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:05,212
I don't feel peaked.

594
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,396
Say...

595
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,004
...give your....

596
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:23,301
Give your mother a call.

597
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,673
Let her know you're alive, yes?

598
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:37,780
You need to eat some red meat, my boy.

599
00:42:39,123 --> 00:42:40,715
You're all pale.

600
00:42:54,805 --> 00:42:57,330
I didn't know he was here.
The key was on the window.

601
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:59,205
We had lunch. I let him in.

602
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:02,177
How was I supposed to know that?
It wasn't my fault.

603
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:05,409
-We had an agreement. You fucked up.
-lt wasn't my fault.

604
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:07,015
You fucking idiot!

605
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:09,283
So....

606
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:12,682
I guess you have to pay rent this month.

607
00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:21,021
Rachel, stop.

608
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:45,485
She's a...

609
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:48,222
...dancer who doesn't dance, and...

610
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,886
...her friend is a painter who doesn't paint.

611
00:43:51,228 --> 00:43:54,789
It's kind of a boho version of
Island of the Lost Toys.

612
00:43:56,934 --> 00:43:59,664
And she's a lot stronger than she looks.

613
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:54,948
I broke my butt!

614
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:08,471
You know what I think about
when I'm this close to another body?

615
00:45:10,974 --> 00:45:12,305
I think...

616
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:14,672
...one day...

617
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,510
...at one moment...

618
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:22,581
...this body that I'm holding in my arms
will stop breathing...

619
00:45:23,587 --> 00:45:25,248
...stop living...

620
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:27,120
...just...

621
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:29,384
...stop.

622
00:45:32,262 --> 00:45:37,461
One day, you'll see my name in the obits
and you'll remember this moment.

623
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:41,997
You're a real fuckin' upper.

624
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:45,201
How did you end up at military school?

625
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:46,669
Mimi.

626
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,609
-Mimi?
-My mother.

627
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:51,205
You call your mother "Mimi"?

628
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,580
"Heinous One" is a bit cumbersome.

629
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:54,878
Right.

630
00:45:54,952 --> 00:45:56,920
"Medea" was already taken.

631
00:45:59,456 --> 00:46:02,186
Your mother sent you to military school?

632
00:46:03,393 --> 00:46:08,194
In all fairness to her, I did get kicked out
of most of the schools on the East Coast.

633
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:15,027
Still, I just assumed that military school
was an empty threat, like with most parents.

634
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,568
She called that bluff.

635
00:46:18,075 --> 00:46:20,805
Do you resent her for sending you there?

636
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:22,510
I'm glad I went.

637
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:24,875
It made everything clear to me.

638
00:46:25,682 --> 00:46:27,013
Like what?

639
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:29,649
The fight.

640
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,150
-15 minutes.
-Okay.

641
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:35,350
Downstairs, dressed,
waiting for your father, in 15 minutes...

642
00:46:35,425 --> 00:46:36,653
...or you're taking the bus.

643
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:37,785
I know.

644
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:54,702
Dad?

645
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:32,436
You see...

646
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:34,836
...Igby...

647
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,240
...I feel this...

648
00:48:38,448 --> 00:48:39,710
...great...

649
00:48:42,352 --> 00:48:43,580
...pressure...

650
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:46,980
...coming down on me.

651
00:48:48,892 --> 00:48:53,261
It's just constantly coming down on me...

652
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,299
...crushing me.

653
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:18,685
You make it sound sinister. That's
what good schools are for, to shape you...

654
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:22,518
...not brainwash you
in some evil, Orwellian way, or...

655
00:49:22,693 --> 00:49:25,093
...squash you
into something you're not, but....

656
00:49:26,163 --> 00:49:28,996
I know my mother
teaches metaphysical poetry at Vassar.

657
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:30,397
I really believe she tries--

658
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:34,460
My father went through the system and
it told him what he was supposed to want.

659
00:49:34,771 --> 00:49:36,398
He achieved everything, and...

660
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,502
...then in his 40s, he flipped.

661
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:40,803
What did he really want?

662
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:43,677
Sunny days.

663
00:49:44,348 --> 00:49:47,613
Now Dad is in the Maryland Home
for the Befuddled.

664
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,719
Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.

665
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:54,614
So, you're never going back to school?

666
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:58,556
What are you planning to do with your life,
lgby? Just kill time until--

667
00:49:58,628 --> 00:50:00,721
My nervous breakdown comes along?

668
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:07,702
Is your father dead?

669
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:09,868
No, why?

670
00:50:10,474 --> 00:50:14,934
'Cause when I talked about mine, you didn't
feel obligated to compare and contrast.

671
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,340
He's a theologian.

672
00:50:18,081 --> 00:50:21,175
A Jewish theologian
and a metaphysical poetess.

673
00:50:22,052 --> 00:50:23,246
Doesn't explain you.

674
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,753
What would?

675
00:50:25,222 --> 00:50:27,019
Cross-dressing psychoanalysts?

676
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:28,755
Heroin junkies?

677
00:50:29,092 --> 00:50:30,855
-I don't know.
-Thanks.

678
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:34,019
My parents...

679
00:50:34,631 --> 00:50:35,962
...were two...

680
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:39,025
...very idealistic, incredibly bright...

681
00:50:39,603 --> 00:50:40,763
...narcissists.

682
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:43,366
I was like their vanity project.

683
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,635
-Oh, my God.
-What?

684
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,233
You torture me.

685
00:50:47,744 --> 00:50:49,507
I was adopted, okay?

686
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:51,342
That would explain everything.

687
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:54,510
'Cause, I mean,
how many Vassar professors...

688
00:50:54,584 --> 00:50:59,214
...and intellectual theologians
beget nymphomaniacal...

689
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:01,257
...pseudo-bohemian J.A.P.s?

690
00:51:01,758 --> 00:51:04,090
Actually, a lot, probably, right?

691
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:08,796
I'm not a J.A.P.

692
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:28,674
-Good morning. I'm Oliver. We met at the--
-Right.

693
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:31,687
At that party in the Hamptons.

694
00:51:31,955 --> 00:51:35,584
-You're the fascist brother.
-He prefers "Young Republican."

695
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:41,890
I'm Sookie.

696
00:51:42,499 --> 00:51:44,558
Excuse me. I've got to....

697
00:51:44,634 --> 00:51:46,397
I'm sorry.

698
00:51:51,575 --> 00:51:54,476
-God, you're pathetic.
-Thank you, fuckwit.

699
00:51:55,645 --> 00:51:57,237
D.H. told you I was here?

700
00:51:57,514 --> 00:52:01,644
Your little vacation's about to
come to a rather abrupt and severe end.

701
00:52:02,486 --> 00:52:03,919
Come again?

702
00:52:03,987 --> 00:52:05,147
You're still a minor.

703
00:52:05,222 --> 00:52:06,280
So?

704
00:52:06,356 --> 00:52:09,553
Since you're not interested
in taking care of your education...

705
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:11,617
...measures are being taken on your behalf.

706
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:13,060
What measures?

707
00:52:13,363 --> 00:52:15,456
Mom's coming up next weekend.

708
00:52:15,832 --> 00:52:16,924
Great.

709
00:52:17,367 --> 00:52:20,666
-I'm taking my equivalency test on Friday.
-Whatever.

710
00:52:20,737 --> 00:52:22,728
I can vouch,
because I made the appointment.

711
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:24,569
-Really?
-Really.

712
00:52:25,175 --> 00:52:27,905
Oh, my God! It's almost the afternoon.

713
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:30,477
Look, it was...

714
00:52:31,081 --> 00:52:34,244
-...nice meeting you. I'm gonna take off.
-Where are you headed?

715
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:36,080
My mom's. Upper East Side.

716
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:38,849
Me, too. That's where I'm staying.

717
00:52:38,922 --> 00:52:41,015
Amidst the cobwebs and geriatrics.

718
00:52:41,091 --> 00:52:42,285
The geriatrics?

719
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:45,692
Everyone's inferior to Ollie in some way.
Ask him, he'll tell ya.

720
00:52:45,762 --> 00:52:47,127
Let me give you a lift.

721
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:50,490
It's a write-off for D.H.
You can't pass up a free ride.

722
00:52:52,402 --> 00:52:54,131
-Friday?
-Friday.

723
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:57,500
See ya.

724
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,373
It's not his real name.

725
00:53:05,715 --> 00:53:09,981
He had a stuffed bear as a kid, Digby Bear.
They were British, I think.

726
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:14,115
And because he always got everything
wrong, he called it "lgby."

727
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:18,127
Whenever he committed a crime,
he would say, "l didn't do it, lgby did."

728
00:53:18,461 --> 00:53:22,454
And to break him of this habit,
being as hip to child psych as she was...

729
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:26,059
...Mimi started referring to him as lgby
every time he lied.

730
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:28,434
He lied a lot.

731
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:34,501
So, you work for your godfather?

732
00:53:34,578 --> 00:53:37,445
Igby's, D.H., who is amazing.

733
00:53:37,847 --> 00:53:40,748
His mind functions only to make money.

734
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:43,781
He thinks he has everything
he could possibly want...

735
00:53:43,853 --> 00:53:48,085
...so he walks around acting the way he
thinks a happy and content man should act.

736
00:53:48,592 --> 00:53:49,616
He's a parody.

737
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:54,221
-lf he's a parody, why do you work for him?
-He's an obscenely rich parody.

738
00:53:54,297 --> 00:53:57,664
And if he wants to make me
in his image, hey.

739
00:53:59,936 --> 00:54:01,927
What does your mother do?

740
00:54:02,172 --> 00:54:06,074
She's a writer,
though mostly she just teaches now.

741
00:54:06,142 --> 00:54:07,404
Is she divorced?

742
00:54:07,677 --> 00:54:08,803
Never married.

743
00:54:08,878 --> 00:54:10,903
-How come?
-Doesn't like men.

744
00:54:11,314 --> 00:54:13,214
-Lesbian.
-No.

745
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:16,641
Just a failed heterosexual.

746
00:54:19,656 --> 00:54:21,988
Listen, thanks for the lift.

747
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,420
Shit!

748
00:54:24,494 --> 00:54:27,054
What, did you lose your wallet?

749
00:54:28,064 --> 00:54:30,464
I don't have the keys
to my aunt's apartment.

750
00:54:30,533 --> 00:54:34,492
-The doorman won't let you in?
-He's totally senile, never remembers me.

751
00:54:34,571 --> 00:54:36,471
I'll just wait for her.

752
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:38,306
Wander around.

753
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:40,434
She'll be in this evening at some point.

754
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:42,637
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

755
00:54:43,346 --> 00:54:45,814
-Could I use your phone?
-Sure.

756
00:54:45,882 --> 00:54:47,577
I mean, God.

757
00:54:47,651 --> 00:54:48,709
Can I get a receipt?

758
00:54:54,557 --> 00:54:55,785
Mimi...

759
00:54:56,693 --> 00:54:59,787
...had been afraid someone
would find something embarrassing.

760
00:55:01,097 --> 00:55:03,463
So up went her little soldier...

761
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:05,494
...while she waited downstairs.

762
00:55:06,202 --> 00:55:08,602
This old lady led me to his desk.

763
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:14,401
And before she left me there, made sure
to give me a nice pat on the head.

764
00:55:14,577 --> 00:55:17,068
I wanted to break her fucking hand.

765
00:55:18,348 --> 00:55:22,307
So, I sat down in my father's chair
and I started looking in his desk.

766
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:24,780
Each drawer that I opened was the same.

767
00:55:25,055 --> 00:55:27,319
No books, no pencils...

768
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:31,554
...just row upon row
of meticulously stacked cigarettes.

769
00:55:31,861 --> 00:55:33,055
Thousands of them.

770
00:55:38,401 --> 00:55:39,891
And all I could think was...

771
00:55:40,103 --> 00:55:43,561
...not the extent to which
my father's sickness had damaged him...

772
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:44,866
...but rather:

773
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:46,064
"Gosh...

774
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:51,043
"...how would somebody do this without
anyone in the office being the wiser?"

775
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:56,175
You know, not "my father's so far fucking
gone, he ain't never comin' back..."

776
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,514
...but just:

777
00:56:02,926 --> 00:56:07,056
"How the fuck
did he get all of these cigarettes...

778
00:56:09,766 --> 00:56:11,358
"...into this desk?"

779
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:15,427
You were numb.

780
00:56:20,577 --> 00:56:22,067
Sookie...

781
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:23,807
...I am numb.

782
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:14,855
-Everything all right here, folks? You okay?
-Great.

783
00:58:15,358 --> 00:58:17,622
Excuse me! I'm sorry.

784
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:58,667
Do you want me to give this to you
or should I hang on to it?

785
00:58:58,735 --> 00:59:01,704
I want you to pin it to my lapel
with my mittens and nametag.

786
00:59:01,771 --> 00:59:05,468
-Snippy. No bus-ride treat for you.
-Shut up!

787
00:59:06,609 --> 00:59:08,941
You're being really immature about this.

788
00:59:09,178 --> 00:59:13,478
If I'm immature, you're prenatal.
God, to be impressed by that preppy prick.

789
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:16,041
We hung out. We're closer in age.

790
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:18,485
He's your brother.
You act like you hate him.

791
00:59:18,688 --> 00:59:19,916
I do!

792
00:59:20,123 --> 00:59:22,648
I do hate him. He's totally hateable.

793
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:26,453
Evil, niblet fuck.

794
00:59:32,201 --> 00:59:36,069
There's been a misunderstanding.
Next fall is not good.

795
00:59:36,139 --> 00:59:39,506
I need my son enrolled this spring.

796
00:59:40,643 --> 00:59:44,170
Have you spoken to his godfather,
D.H. Banes?

797
00:59:44,681 --> 00:59:47,548
Igby is his favorite charity.

798
00:59:47,617 --> 00:59:50,552
He's sponsoring the boy, as in, financially.

799
00:59:51,788 --> 00:59:57,158
What do we have to do, then,
to make it happen this spring?

800
00:59:58,461 --> 00:59:59,758
You do that.

801
01:00:00,029 --> 01:00:01,826
Thank you very much.

802
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:03,459
Bye-bye.

803
01:00:09,405 --> 01:00:12,704
I'm goin' to California.
I need a fuckin' sunny day.

804
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:14,607
Can I come?

805
01:00:14,978 --> 01:00:16,309
I'm serious.

806
01:00:16,846 --> 01:00:18,677
There's nothing keeping me here.

807
01:00:19,015 --> 01:00:20,380
Except perhaps poverty.

808
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:23,180
-Can't let that stop you.
-I can't.

809
01:00:23,853 --> 01:00:26,515
I've always wanted
to drive across the country.

810
01:00:26,756 --> 01:00:29,316
-Maybe this summer.
-Fuck that. I'm flying.

811
01:00:29,525 --> 01:00:32,016
-I wanna come, asshole.
-Good.

812
01:00:33,696 --> 01:00:36,290
'Cause I'd be afraid to go by myself.

813
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:58,011
-May I freshen your drink?
-A little baby portion, please.

814
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:02,089
Bigger baby.

815
01:01:06,963 --> 01:01:08,294
Thank you.

816
01:01:14,971 --> 01:01:16,836
I must say...

817
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:19,338
...you have perfected the hobo look.

818
01:01:20,109 --> 01:01:23,704
You didn't buy the suit, did you?
Someone left it someplace for you?

819
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:24,872
Dad.

820
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:26,375
How apropos.

821
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,748
I want my money.

822
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:33,147
My money from Dad.

823
01:01:33,222 --> 01:01:34,917
I'll get it in two years, anyway.

824
01:01:34,991 --> 01:01:38,518
-So you can extend your vacation?
-I need it.

825
01:01:38,895 --> 01:01:40,590
You freed it up early for Ollie.

826
01:01:41,764 --> 01:01:45,222
Ollie graduated from high school.
He graduated at the top of his class.

827
01:01:45,301 --> 01:01:48,327
He earned it.
I'm not gonna subsidize your being a bum.

828
01:01:48,404 --> 01:01:50,463
-It's a moot point, anyhow.
-What do you mean?

829
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:54,636
You're assuming Jason provided for you
in the same manner he provided for Ollie.

830
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:55,735
Yes.

831
01:01:55,812 --> 01:01:56,904
He didn't.

832
01:01:57,814 --> 01:01:59,281
You're lying.

833
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:01,610
Darling...

834
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:04,451
...why would I lie when I can just say "no"?

835
01:02:08,091 --> 01:02:11,185
I've had a conversation with Mr. McKaye...

836
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:16,197
...headmaster of St. Anthony's, and in spite
of your little disappearing act this fall...

837
01:02:16,999 --> 01:02:21,163
...he has agreed to admit you
after Christmas.

838
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:23,603
-You'll be boarding there--
-I'm not going back.

839
01:02:23,673 --> 01:02:26,608
I passed the equivalency test.
I don't have to go back.

840
01:02:26,876 --> 01:02:31,836
Of course, I don't trust you with the train
fare, so if you just look up Ollie...

841
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:35,141
...tell him that I will reimburse him
if he buys your ticket.

842
01:02:35,218 --> 01:02:37,118
-I don't have his number.
-D.H. does.

843
01:02:39,021 --> 01:02:41,546
If it had just occurred to me
to mention it to Ollie.

844
01:02:41,624 --> 01:02:44,457
I saw him this afternoon,
for lunch, with his girlfriend.

845
01:02:44,527 --> 01:02:47,052
In fact, you just missed him,
darling, by about...

846
01:02:47,163 --> 01:02:48,960
...an hour and a half.

847
01:02:50,032 --> 01:02:51,499
His Connecticut one?

848
01:02:53,202 --> 01:02:58,037
Though I rather liked her. This is a new
one, a rather attractive New York girl, a...

849
01:02:58,641 --> 01:03:00,040
...Jewish girl.

850
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:14,382
You've reached my studio. If you want to
rent, leave your information after the beep.

851
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:16,254
Otherwise, you know what to do.

852
01:03:17,393 --> 01:03:20,260
Honey? I hope I caught you.

853
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:23,662
Guess where I am. St. Vincent's Hospital.

854
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:25,934
We're having a party.

855
01:03:26,002 --> 01:03:29,028
Everybody is here, just fucking everybody.

856
01:03:29,672 --> 01:03:30,969
It's a party.

857
01:03:31,507 --> 01:03:34,305
A bad batch Mama sold you.

858
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:36,942
But I caught you in time, right?

859
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:40,146
You're not coming to this party, right?

860
01:03:45,021 --> 01:03:46,989
Hello, Bunny? It's Igby.

861
01:03:47,223 --> 01:03:51,057
I'm in New York. Listen, is D.H. there?

862
01:03:51,427 --> 01:03:56,160
Thank you. She was by my place,
literally, seconds ago.

863
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:59,434
She must've used in the cab
on the way home.

864
01:03:59,936 --> 01:04:02,928
My God, what's that about, right?

865
01:04:03,606 --> 01:04:06,336
A little patience, girl, huh?

866
01:04:06,909 --> 01:04:10,436
Hi. The doctor said
that she's gonna be fine.

867
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:13,008
Out tomorrow maybe.

868
01:04:13,082 --> 01:04:15,607
Everything's taken care of.
Nothing more to do here.

869
01:04:15,818 --> 01:04:19,345
I'm Rachel's friend, Russel.

870
01:04:21,457 --> 01:04:22,481
Hi.

871
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:26,454
Need a lift? Headed back to the loft?

872
01:04:27,129 --> 01:04:30,189
-Yeah. Thanks, D.H.
-Please.

873
01:04:33,636 --> 01:04:36,400
I'm sorry I called like that.
I didn't know what else to do.

874
01:04:36,472 --> 01:04:39,202
You did the right thing.
I'm glad we were on the island.

875
01:04:39,275 --> 01:04:40,572
Good boy.

876
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:42,641
Very good boy.

877
01:04:52,655 --> 01:04:57,592
You know, I was the best man at your
parents' wedding. Did you know that, lgby?

878
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:01,828
The golden couple.
That's what the paper called it.

879
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:04,195
My boy.

880
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:11,038
You know what I think you've been up to?
I think you've been pissing...

881
01:05:11,107 --> 01:05:13,200
...in the well from which you drink.

882
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:16,242
That's what I think you've been up to.

883
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:42,927
What happened?

884
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,771
Breach of contract.

885
01:05:46,208 --> 01:05:47,766
D.H. did this to you?

886
01:05:48,678 --> 01:05:51,806
-I didn't know he could get angry.
-He wasn't angry.

887
01:05:51,881 --> 01:05:53,542
He felt obligated.

888
01:05:54,884 --> 01:05:58,411
Not to worry. I doubt it will affect
your position as his prime punk.

889
01:05:58,821 --> 01:06:02,985
I think if Gandhi had had to hang out
with you for any prolonged period of time...

890
01:06:03,059 --> 01:06:05,527
...he'd have ended up
kicking the shit out of you.

891
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:07,728
Fuckwit.

892
01:06:08,064 --> 01:06:09,554
Why?

893
01:06:09,732 --> 01:06:10,926
Rachel.

894
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:13,958
You're screwing Rachel?

895
01:06:14,103 --> 01:06:15,695
You're screwing Rachel?

896
01:06:15,771 --> 01:06:17,966
Where was Rachel
when all this was going on?

897
01:06:18,941 --> 01:06:20,135
OD'd.

898
01:06:22,078 --> 01:06:23,841
Is she dead?

899
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:26,406
St. Vincent's.

900
01:06:28,884 --> 01:06:30,351
Unbelievable.

901
01:06:31,787 --> 01:06:34,153
Mom wanted me to escort you down to DC...

902
01:06:34,223 --> 01:06:37,818
...and deliver you to St. Anthony's,
but you can't travel now.

903
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:40,191
At least not with me.

904
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:44,256
I'm not going. I took the equivalency test.

905
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:46,301
-I don't have to go.
-Humor her.

906
01:06:46,369 --> 01:06:48,234
Humor me and fuck off.

907
01:06:49,939 --> 01:06:51,839
Apparently, they found another lump.

908
01:06:51,907 --> 01:06:52,896
Good.

909
01:07:07,056 --> 01:07:09,149
Say hello to Sookie for me.

910
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:22,198
You see...

911
01:07:23,606 --> 01:07:25,096
...I have this....

912
01:07:27,443 --> 01:07:28,842
I feel...

913
01:07:29,512 --> 01:07:30,604
...this...

914
01:07:30,913 --> 01:07:32,312
...great...

915
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:35,778
...pressure...

916
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:39,381
...coming down on me.

917
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:43,351
It's crushing me.

918
01:08:00,609 --> 01:08:04,010
It's just you and me, old man.

919
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:52,350
Are you there?

920
01:08:53,863 --> 01:08:55,660
Oh, my God!

921
01:08:56,699 --> 01:09:00,260
I'm in the shower.
Go away. Come back later!

922
01:09:00,336 --> 01:09:03,169
-We've gotta go now. I gotta get out of here.
-What?

923
01:09:03,239 --> 01:09:06,936
We gotta go. I know we said the summer,
but we gotta go now.

924
01:09:07,243 --> 01:09:09,268
There's something that I have to tell you.

925
01:09:09,345 --> 01:09:11,370
Ollie. I know.

926
01:09:11,447 --> 01:09:15,281
-How soon can you be ready?
-I can't go with you.

927
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:17,517
Things have changed.

928
01:09:17,786 --> 01:09:19,583
They haven't.

929
01:09:19,688 --> 01:09:23,215
You're my friend!
That hasn't changed, right?

930
01:09:23,292 --> 01:09:26,853
That hasn't changed. But....

931
01:09:27,296 --> 01:09:29,093
Ollie and I are....

932
01:09:31,233 --> 01:09:32,723
We're the same age, and--

933
01:09:36,272 --> 01:09:38,331
Calm down!

934
01:09:38,407 --> 01:09:41,274
This is perfect! This is fucking perfect!

935
01:09:41,410 --> 01:09:43,970
Sookie Sapperstein
and the Young Republican.

936
01:09:44,046 --> 01:09:46,844
-Of course. How natural!
-Shut up!

937
01:09:46,916 --> 01:09:48,645
You think you're what he wants?

938
01:09:48,717 --> 01:09:52,016
You think that you fit the picture
of how he wants his life to look?

939
01:09:52,087 --> 01:09:55,648
You think that he would bring you
back to our mother as a potential wife?

940
01:09:55,724 --> 01:09:57,191
Our mother?

941
01:09:57,293 --> 01:10:00,126
She'd be nice to your face,
but the first opportunity...

942
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:02,061
...she'd pull him aside and warn him off.

943
01:10:02,131 --> 01:10:05,794
"Mongrel children have such
a hard time fitting in, dearest!"

944
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:07,631
Shut up!

945
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:10,399
He will lie to you!

946
01:10:10,472 --> 01:10:13,498
He will use you up and marry some inbred...

947
01:10:13,576 --> 01:10:17,376
...Darien Frau who will beget him
all the towheaded brats he can afford.

948
01:10:17,446 --> 01:10:19,004
Go away!

949
01:10:19,081 --> 01:10:21,049
They are rigid and they are cold!

950
01:10:21,116 --> 01:10:25,610
And you don't know
they are cold to the fuckin' bone!

951
01:10:30,626 --> 01:10:32,992
I'm not going with you.

952
01:10:42,705 --> 01:10:44,070
I'm scared.

953
01:11:00,222 --> 01:11:03,453
You're just a glutton for fuckin' punishment,
aren't you, lgs?

954
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:16,358
Russel!

955
01:12:21,370 --> 01:12:23,361
I need a job!

956
01:12:36,518 --> 01:12:37,712
Hello?

957
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:39,080
Lisa Fiedler's?

958
01:12:40,389 --> 01:12:42,323
I know a girl from Baltimore.

959
01:12:43,325 --> 01:12:44,553
So what?

960
01:12:46,161 --> 01:12:48,061
I know a girl from Baltimore.

961
01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:50,121
What are you talking about?

962
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:54,598
I know a girl from Baltimore!

963
01:12:54,703 --> 01:12:55,931
So do I!

964
01:12:56,338 --> 01:12:59,307
Lisa, there's some guy here for you,
but he keeps talking--

965
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:01,104
-Who is it?
-I don't know.

966
01:13:01,176 --> 01:13:02,939
He's saying something about Baltimore?

967
01:13:03,011 --> 01:13:05,241
-The drugs!
-The drugs!

968
01:13:07,383 --> 01:13:10,045
It's me. I'm at Fiedler's house.

969
01:13:10,252 --> 01:13:12,948
She wants to know
if she can pay with a personal check.

970
01:13:13,555 --> 01:13:15,318
-You have no cash?
-No.

971
01:13:15,457 --> 01:13:18,654
I might have enough
in travelers' checks and francs.

972
01:13:18,727 --> 01:13:21,287
Her roommate
may have enough in travelers' checks.

973
01:13:21,363 --> 01:13:23,263
And francs!

974
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:30,633
Okay.

975
01:13:31,573 --> 01:13:32,597
You'll owe us.

976
01:13:36,011 --> 01:13:39,378
Why don't you make yourself comfortable,
guy? I'll be right back.

977
01:13:44,987 --> 01:13:46,045
Miss Piggee?

978
01:13:46,989 --> 01:13:48,456
Yes?

979
01:13:48,624 --> 01:13:49,955
It's lgby.

980
01:13:51,794 --> 01:13:54,627
Ollie Slocumb's younger brother....

981
01:13:55,798 --> 01:13:58,562
Of course!

982
01:14:00,803 --> 01:14:03,966
How is Ollie? Columbia, right?

983
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:05,632
Right.

984
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:09,139
We're all hoping
that once he's healed from the accident...

985
01:14:09,211 --> 01:14:10,735
...that he'll be able to...

986
01:14:10,813 --> 01:14:13,475
...Iead a fairly normal life
and be able to go back to a--

987
01:14:13,549 --> 01:14:14,538
Oh, no!

988
01:14:16,018 --> 01:14:17,178
What happened?

989
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:21,016
Apparently, as far as anyone can tell...

990
01:14:21,089 --> 01:14:25,185
...he was 10-speeding a gazillion miles an
hour through Central Park...

991
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:27,922
...racing with all the other Young Turks.

992
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:33,290
He apparently caught his own reflection
in the handlebar mirror, and became so...

993
01:14:33,635 --> 01:14:36,695
...aroused by it
that he burst his Speedo shorts...

994
01:14:36,772 --> 01:14:40,868
...which then got caught in the gears
and just threw him on his face, splatter.

995
01:14:41,043 --> 01:14:45,480
Luckily, someone had the presence of mind
to scrape his face off the pavement...

996
01:14:45,547 --> 01:14:46,878
...and put it on ice.

997
01:14:46,949 --> 01:14:50,077
-Doctors were able to graft most of it back--
-I'm sorry.

998
01:14:54,022 --> 01:14:55,853
And you....

999
01:14:57,192 --> 01:14:58,921
This is what you're up to.

1000
01:14:59,361 --> 01:15:01,022
Bigger-picture Darwinism.

1001
01:15:02,965 --> 01:15:04,933
You two know each other.

1002
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:06,862
Wow!

1003
01:15:08,103 --> 01:15:11,834
Igby Slocumb was in my art class.
He was one of my students.

1004
01:15:12,274 --> 01:15:15,835
You used to call me Miss Piggy, didn't you?

1005
01:15:16,144 --> 01:15:17,236
Yeah.

1006
01:15:23,018 --> 01:15:24,883
Do you want me to cut this for you?

1007
01:15:30,692 --> 01:15:31,784
Fuck!

1008
01:15:36,231 --> 01:15:37,323
Lucky Charms?

1009
01:15:37,699 --> 01:15:38,688
What?

1010
01:15:38,767 --> 01:15:41,600
Fuckin' Lucky Charms!

1011
01:15:42,037 --> 01:15:43,561
I don't know.

1012
01:15:53,615 --> 01:15:55,310
Psycho bitch!

1013
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:00,548
What did you do with her Lucky Charms?

1014
01:16:01,056 --> 01:16:02,284
Nothing.

1015
01:16:04,493 --> 01:16:06,154
She's a bit upset.

1016
01:16:07,029 --> 01:16:11,432
Her one-woman show wasn't terribly
well received at The Pyramid tonight.

1017
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:13,565
Really?

1018
01:16:13,802 --> 01:16:16,430
The world isn't ready for Peeka!

1019
01:16:16,872 --> 01:16:18,703
-No?
-I told her.

1020
01:16:19,274 --> 01:16:22,402
Lorna Luft was just too fucking obscure.

1021
01:16:22,711 --> 01:16:24,906
People just think you're doing a bad Liza.

1022
01:16:25,647 --> 01:16:28,673
-I love Lorna.
-Me, too.

1023
01:16:36,291 --> 01:16:38,054
Your brother is looking for you.

1024
01:16:41,129 --> 01:16:42,653
Your mom is dying.

1025
01:16:42,764 --> 01:16:43,856
Yeah?

1026
01:16:46,802 --> 01:16:47,791
Yeah.

1027
01:16:49,304 --> 01:16:51,431
You know what you have to think of it as?

1028
01:16:51,506 --> 01:16:52,632
What?

1029
01:16:54,242 --> 01:16:56,403
Like an act of God.

1030
01:16:57,980 --> 01:17:00,574
If there were a God,
he'd have acted a lot sooner.

1031
01:17:00,649 --> 01:17:02,776
-What?
-Nothing.

1032
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:07,750
-He left you a ticket.
-Excellent.

1033
01:17:07,823 --> 01:17:09,290
It's non-refundable.

1034
01:17:09,791 --> 01:17:11,656
He wanted me to tell you that.

1035
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:12,952
Dick.

1036
01:17:43,825 --> 01:17:45,816
I gotta take a piss.

1037
01:17:56,405 --> 01:17:57,667
Toilet paper?

1038
01:18:00,475 --> 01:18:01,464
Here.

1039
01:18:01,843 --> 01:18:03,003
It's Russel's.

1040
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:06,741
How are you doing?

1041
01:18:07,482 --> 01:18:10,383
I'm pretty sensational, actually.

1042
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:12,953
And you?

1043
01:18:13,922 --> 01:18:14,946
Good.

1044
01:18:15,657 --> 01:18:16,681
Really.

1045
01:18:17,926 --> 01:18:19,018
But....

1046
01:18:21,663 --> 01:18:23,290
How is D.H.?

1047
01:18:25,634 --> 01:18:27,101
Does he miss me?

1048
01:18:27,936 --> 01:18:31,099
-I haven't spoken to him since--
-I bet he does.

1049
01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:39,472
You're cute.

1050
01:18:53,762 --> 01:18:54,990
Come on.

1051
01:18:56,865 --> 01:18:57,957
Down.

1052
01:19:08,710 --> 01:19:09,802
What?

1053
01:19:10,712 --> 01:19:12,339
Your poor mother.

1054
01:19:24,793 --> 01:19:27,887
I've been hoarding Seconal
like a proper junkie.

1055
01:19:28,263 --> 01:19:29,525
I'm ready.

1056
01:19:30,265 --> 01:19:32,290
It's time to round up your brother.

1057
01:20:12,908 --> 01:20:14,170
What's this?

1058
01:20:14,409 --> 01:20:16,206
An ice-cream sundae.

1059
01:20:17,145 --> 01:20:18,407
I accept.

1060
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:24,846
I'm going to DC this weekend
and kill my mother.

1061
01:20:25,287 --> 01:20:26,686
I'm shocked.

1062
01:20:29,057 --> 01:20:30,547
Ollie called me.

1063
01:20:31,459 --> 01:20:33,484
Apparently, he called everybody.

1064
01:20:33,562 --> 01:20:34,927
Stole your thunder.

1065
01:20:34,996 --> 01:20:36,463
Asshole.

1066
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:42,827
-This must be very hard on you.
-Not as fucking hard as it's gonna be on her.

1067
01:20:42,904 --> 01:20:46,237
-You're just angry and confused.
-Oh, my God, don't do that to me.

1068
01:20:46,308 --> 01:20:48,538
-What?
-Psych 101 me.

1069
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:51,636
You're a furious boy. I mean,
eventually you won't be a boy...

1070
01:20:51,713 --> 01:20:54,409
-...and it'll eat you up.
-Furious boy?

1071
01:20:54,716 --> 01:20:58,311
The thought
that I'm going to live my life without...

1072
01:20:58,386 --> 01:21:02,288
...ever having told her to fuck off,
is pretty goddamn infuriating.

1073
01:21:16,004 --> 01:21:17,767
Do you hate my guts?

1074
01:21:18,473 --> 01:21:20,065
For a month I did.

1075
01:21:20,275 --> 01:21:22,175
Now you're not even in my top five.

1076
01:21:22,644 --> 01:21:23,736
Good.

1077
01:21:23,945 --> 01:21:25,503
I missed you.

1078
01:21:27,616 --> 01:21:30,312
My life is, I don't know.

1079
01:21:30,518 --> 01:21:32,145
I'm drowning in assholes.

1080
01:21:33,355 --> 01:21:34,947
I'm your friend.

1081
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:40,059
Listen, after....

1082
01:21:40,829 --> 01:21:42,922
I'm not coming back. Not to New York.

1083
01:21:43,431 --> 01:21:44,625
I know.

1084
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:49,063
Can we go to your mom's apartment
and have sex?

1085
01:21:49,137 --> 01:21:50,126
No!

1086
01:21:50,605 --> 01:21:53,096
You think that'll make you
feel better? It won't.

1087
01:21:53,174 --> 01:21:56,268
It'll just make you feel really empty and sad.

1088
01:21:57,445 --> 01:21:59,413
You're better off masturbating.

1089
01:22:05,287 --> 01:22:06,948
Thank you for coming down.

1090
01:22:07,489 --> 01:22:09,821
Didn't want to fuck up my inheritance, did l?

1091
01:22:11,559 --> 01:22:13,527
Ollie has talked to you?

1092
01:22:16,798 --> 01:22:19,289
He explained what is to take place?

1093
01:22:19,434 --> 01:22:23,165
He said something about bludgeoning you
with a phone, but he didn't really...

1094
01:22:23,238 --> 01:22:25,103
...go into specifics.

1095
01:22:33,915 --> 01:22:38,113
The irony is that I took for granted
I'd outlive you all.

1096
01:22:38,186 --> 01:22:41,280
You'd think, in this family,
that I would be the least likely.

1097
01:22:42,123 --> 01:22:45,422
Jason, happy as a clam.
He'll live forever in the institution, you--

1098
01:22:45,493 --> 01:22:48,519
You know, just because you're dying,
I'm not going to apologize.

1099
01:22:48,596 --> 01:22:51,190
Not for anything that I've ever done.

1100
01:22:53,068 --> 01:22:55,263
Why do you want me to be here, Mother?

1101
01:22:57,205 --> 01:22:58,672
Comic relief?

1102
01:23:25,233 --> 01:23:27,030
I'm going for a walk.

1103
01:23:36,378 --> 01:23:39,040
-Ollie, what are you drinking?
-Scotch.

1104
01:23:39,414 --> 01:23:40,608
Scotch!

1105
01:23:42,584 --> 01:23:45,519
-I guess D.H. told you.
-What?

1106
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:50,086
We've decided to bump
all those incredibly prominent and...

1107
01:23:50,158 --> 01:23:54,561
...terribly chic persons that you were
expecting to speak at your memorial, and...

1108
01:23:54,763 --> 01:23:56,924
...have me speak for two hours or so.

1109
01:23:56,998 --> 01:23:58,761
What a clever idea.

1110
01:23:59,501 --> 01:24:01,799
You do understand, though,
don't you, that...

1111
01:24:01,903 --> 01:24:06,704
...it is customary in a eulogy to
at least make reference to the deceased?

1112
01:24:07,008 --> 01:24:08,805
I intend to, Mother.

1113
01:24:09,911 --> 01:24:11,378
Time permitting.

1114
01:24:16,718 --> 01:24:18,481
Are we ready?

1115
01:24:19,921 --> 01:24:21,252
Shall we do this?

1116
01:24:23,591 --> 01:24:27,152
You know, once we start, you must
get as much inside you as possible.

1117
01:24:27,228 --> 01:24:29,526
We've been through this.

1118
01:24:30,999 --> 01:24:33,229
I don't want to have to do this again.

1119
01:24:45,447 --> 01:24:49,747
Is that strawberry? I thought the idea was
to stop me from vomiting up the poison.

1120
01:24:57,392 --> 01:24:58,552
Wait.

1121
01:25:01,863 --> 01:25:04,559
I take it you know D.H. is your father.

1122
01:25:06,334 --> 01:25:07,358
No.

1123
01:25:07,435 --> 01:25:10,233
Then I'm really glad I told you.

1124
01:25:11,973 --> 01:25:13,702
Make yum-yum.

1125
01:25:33,895 --> 01:25:36,329
Much love, all right?

1126
01:27:02,617 --> 01:27:05,177
C'mon, wake up!

1127
01:27:12,327 --> 01:27:13,954
Come on!

1128
01:27:20,935 --> 01:27:22,266
I'm sorry.

1129
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:54,062
Listen....

1130
01:27:55,703 --> 01:27:59,264
Do you wanna see the body
before they come to collect it?

1131
01:28:08,650 --> 01:28:10,117
I've seen it.

1132
01:28:36,544 --> 01:28:37,704
Excuse me.

1133
01:28:44,652 --> 01:28:46,552
Hello, Mrs. Hathaway?

1134
01:28:47,889 --> 01:28:50,016
This is Jason Slocumb, Jr.

1135
01:28:54,796 --> 01:28:56,525
I'm afraid she can't.

1136
01:28:57,231 --> 01:28:58,755
'Cause she's dead.

1137
01:28:59,133 --> 01:29:02,432
He's always enjoyed
being the bearer of bad tidings.

1138
01:29:07,742 --> 01:29:09,972
Hello, Mrs. Bittle. It's lgby.

1139
01:29:11,112 --> 01:29:14,047
-lf you could sign this release.
-I'd love to, Mrs. Bittle...

1140
01:29:14,115 --> 01:29:15,639
...but she's dead.

1141
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:33,362
Great job.

1142
01:29:33,935 --> 01:29:34,959
Thank you.

1143
01:29:35,470 --> 01:29:36,630
Aunt Penelope?

1144
01:29:37,438 --> 01:29:40,703
-It's lgby.
-This all seems to be in order.

1145
01:29:41,609 --> 01:29:43,042
I'm in Washington.

1146
01:29:43,778 --> 01:29:46,770
This is for you and your helpers.

1147
01:29:46,848 --> 01:29:49,783
Thank you very much.
That's very generous of you.

1148
01:29:52,587 --> 01:29:55,488
I'm sure she'd love to, Aunt Penelope.

1149
01:29:55,556 --> 01:29:58,024
Except for one thing.

1150
01:30:19,313 --> 01:30:21,679
Yes, Aunt Penelope, I'm sure she was.

1151
01:30:23,251 --> 01:30:24,479
Tuesday.

1152
01:30:24,952 --> 01:30:26,112
Thank you.

1153
01:30:26,988 --> 01:30:28,080
Bye-bye.

1154
01:30:34,796 --> 01:30:36,286
It's ironic...

1155
01:30:38,132 --> 01:30:41,363
...that the first time
in my entire life that I feel...

1156
01:30:41,436 --> 01:30:44,405
...remotely affectionate toward her
is when she's dead.

1157
01:30:47,775 --> 01:30:49,675
You beat up her corpse.

1158
01:30:51,145 --> 01:30:52,669
After that.

1159
01:30:53,614 --> 01:30:56,515
The service is in two days.
You can stay in your old room.

1160
01:30:56,584 --> 01:30:58,745
You killed her. You bury her.

1161
01:31:00,455 --> 01:31:01,820
I'm joking.

1162
01:31:03,191 --> 01:31:07,321
Listen, I've got this discount fare, and...

1163
01:31:08,129 --> 01:31:10,427
...it'd be kinda hypocritical of me.

1164
01:31:10,865 --> 01:31:12,059
You know.

1165
01:31:13,100 --> 01:31:16,399
-You'll handle it like everything else, right?
-Right.

1166
01:31:18,473 --> 01:31:19,804
You should hate me.

1167
01:31:19,941 --> 01:31:21,169
I don't.

1168
01:31:21,309 --> 01:31:23,436
-You should.
-I don't hate you.

1169
01:31:23,578 --> 01:31:25,136
Don't be indulgent.

1170
01:31:25,613 --> 01:31:26,807
Never that.

1171
01:31:28,416 --> 01:31:31,874
-You're going to California?
-Yep. The Sunshine State.

1172
01:31:31,953 --> 01:31:34,649
Actually, Florida's the Sunshine State.

1173
01:31:35,022 --> 01:31:36,216
Really?

1174
01:31:38,025 --> 01:31:40,084
Three thousand fuckin' miles
away from here.

1175
01:31:40,328 --> 01:31:42,489
Is there a number where we can reach you?

1176
01:31:42,563 --> 01:31:44,030
We? No.

1177
01:31:44,565 --> 01:31:46,362
You'll call when there is.

1178
01:31:52,373 --> 01:31:55,035
There really isn't that much
between us, is there?

1179
01:31:55,977 --> 01:31:58,468
Just an ever-diminishing amount of blood.

1180
01:32:02,717 --> 01:32:03,775
Bye.

1181
01:32:08,956 --> 01:32:10,287
Well done.
