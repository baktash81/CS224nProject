1
00:01:01,012 --> 00:01:02,104
Come on, sweetie pie.

2
00:01:03,248 --> 00:01:07,742
Morning, Elvis.
You're a pretty Elvis, aren't you?

3
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:10,117
Yes, you are.

4
00:01:10,188 --> 00:01:12,782
Yes, you are.

5
00:01:12,857 --> 00:01:16,315
Jesus Christ, Ronnie, you know
I have to fucking work tonight.

6
00:01:17,028 --> 00:01:18,052
Somebody around here
has got to make some money.

7
00:01:18,663 --> 00:01:21,257
I'm all broken up here, bitch.
I can't work.

8
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:23,699
- Yeah, and whose fault is that?
- Fuck you.

9
00:01:23,768 --> 00:01:26,032
Oh, my God, you're pathetic.

10
00:01:26,104 --> 00:01:28,299
You know that new waitress
over at the Bingo Lounge?

11
00:01:28,373 --> 00:01:30,603
She's been giving 
me the freaky eye.

12
00:01:30,675 --> 00:01:33,075
Oh, the whore with the big tits
hanging down to her knees?

13
00:01:33,144 --> 00:01:34,338
Maybe I'll choke the chicken,

14
00:01:34,412 --> 00:01:36,903
purge my snorkel
all over them flappy-ass tits.

15
00:01:36,981 --> 00:01:38,243
Good. Well, have
a good fucking time.

16
00:01:38,316 --> 00:01:39,578
- I will.
- I hope she likes cripples.

17
00:01:39,651 --> 00:01:43,781
Bitch, I will crawl over there,
and I will skull fuck the shit outta you!

18
00:01:43,855 --> 00:01:45,948
Oh, I'll get the crutches for you.

19
00:01:48,526 --> 00:01:50,494
See what you did?
Fucking loudmouth.

20
00:01:50,561 --> 00:01:51,550
Waah! Waah!

21
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:53,324
That's all that fucker does is cry.

22
00:01:53,398 --> 00:01:55,298
Waah! Waah!

23
00:01:56,134 --> 00:01:57,829
Cry and shit. Cry and shit.

24
00:01:57,902 --> 00:01:59,802
Just like you.
That's all you do is cry and shit.

25
00:01:59,871 --> 00:02:02,101
Fuck you and set it
on my pole right now, bitch.

26
00:02:02,173 --> 00:02:03,800
Fuck off.

27
00:02:09,547 --> 00:02:11,640
Mom?

28
00:02:14,752 --> 00:02:16,777
Can't you see I'm 
making eggs over here?

29
00:02:16,854 --> 00:02:18,321
I'll pass.

30
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:19,447
Since when?

31
00:02:19,524 --> 00:02:22,857
Since now. They're chicken abortions,
and they're fucking gross.

32
00:02:22,927 --> 00:02:24,758
They are not chicken abortions.

33
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:26,524
Like you know what an abortion is.

34
00:02:28,466 --> 00:02:30,161
You know what, can you please
go upstairs and get your brother?

35
00:02:30,501 --> 00:02:32,162
Why do I always have to do it?

36
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:33,430
Just do it!

37
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,932
Don't you give me that look!

38
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:41,945
Man, that bitch got herself
a nice little dumper.

39
00:02:43,147 --> 00:02:45,843
- What did you just say?
- You heard me.

40
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:49,080
No, say it again, Ronnie!
Say it to my face!

41
00:02:49,153 --> 00:02:52,680
Oh, what's the matter?
You jealous of your own daughter's ass?

42
00:02:52,757 --> 00:02:54,918
- Fucking pig.
- Aah!

43
00:02:54,993 --> 00:02:56,585
You fucking whore!

44
00:02:57,795 --> 00:03:00,320
All right, now clean it up!

45
00:03:00,398 --> 00:03:01,922
- Go on.
- I'm not gonna do this anymore!

46
00:03:03,568 --> 00:03:05,263
Michael.

47
00:03:05,336 --> 00:03:07,566
Stop jerking off in there.

48
00:03:07,638 --> 00:03:08,935
Get away!

49
00:03:09,007 --> 00:03:11,100
Hey! Get your ass downstairs

50
00:03:11,175 --> 00:03:13,040
and wash your hands, you little shit.

51
00:03:13,111 --> 00:03:16,638
I'm not listening!
Aaaahhh!

52
00:03:16,714 --> 00:03:17,942
Let me tell you something.

53
00:03:18,016 --> 00:03:20,177
That freak of yours,
he needs some serious discipline.

54
00:03:20,251 --> 00:03:22,242
I mean, he runs around 
like a little bitch.

55
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,220
You leave him alone.
Keep your hands off him.

56
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,519
Give me a fucking break.
He's probably a queer.

57
00:03:27,592 --> 00:03:29,890
He's gonna grow up,
end up cutting his dick and balls off

58
00:03:29,961 --> 00:03:31,792
and changing his name to Michelle.

59
00:03:33,031 --> 00:03:35,727
<i>There he is.
Good morning, Michelle, ma belle.</i>

60
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,768
What the hell took you two so long?

61
00:03:37,835 --> 00:03:40,736
Elvis died. I had to flush him.

62
00:03:40,805 --> 00:03:43,273
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

63
00:03:43,341 --> 00:03:45,502
We'll get you a new one
after school, okay?

64
00:03:45,576 --> 00:03:46,838
Okay.

65
00:03:46,911 --> 00:03:49,846
What'd you do to him,
stroke him to death?

66
00:03:49,914 --> 00:03:51,404
Uh, Elvis.

67
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:54,178
Elvis! Uh! Uh! Uh!

68
00:03:54,252 --> 00:03:56,117
You know what?
It's a fucking rat.

69
00:03:56,187 --> 00:03:57,984
Who pays money for a fucking rat?

70
00:03:58,056 --> 00:03:59,853
I mean, it's a goddamn rat, man.

71
00:03:59,924 --> 00:04:01,255
Morning, Boo.

72
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:03,793
"Morning, Boo."

73
00:04:07,532 --> 00:04:08,829
Take that damn thing off.

74
00:04:13,237 --> 00:04:14,704
You are starting to annoy me, boy.

75
00:04:14,772 --> 00:04:15,796
I hate you.

76
00:04:15,873 --> 00:04:17,864
And I hate you, too. You see this?

77
00:04:17,942 --> 00:04:20,809
As soon as this heals,
I'm gonna break it again on your fucking face!

78
00:04:20,878 --> 00:04:23,346
Enough, all right?
Can we just eat in peace for once?

79
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:37,090
What a fucking pussy, dude.
I told you he wouldn't fight.

80
00:04:37,161 --> 00:04:39,152
He's all fucking talk.
I was like-- We were fighting, right?

81
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,892
You were there. He was like,
"I'm not gonna fight you." I was like--

82
00:04:41,966 --> 00:04:43,160
Yes!

83
00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:46,000
I know where he lives.

84
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,300
- You want to egg his house?
- We can totally do that.

85
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:49,498
- Yeah.
- Oh.

86
00:04:49,574 --> 00:04:51,474
Hey, shit-pants.

87
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:54,033
What's going on? You know, um...

88
00:04:54,112 --> 00:04:57,673
I heard your sister got caught
selling blow jobs in the bathroom.

89
00:04:57,748 --> 00:05:02,742
I heard they had to pump the cum
out of her stomach.

90
00:05:04,622 --> 00:05:06,385
Hey, Mikey, how's your mom doing?

91
00:05:06,457 --> 00:05:09,620
You know, my old man said that for a buck
she'd rub her tits on his face.

92
00:05:09,694 --> 00:05:11,286
Shut up.

93
00:05:11,362 --> 00:05:12,693
What the fuck did you say, faggot?

94
00:05:12,763 --> 00:05:15,527
- Mikey's upset.
- Look how tough he is.

95
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,366
Hey, ball-licker, check this out.

96
00:05:19,437 --> 00:05:23,430
I was thinking of making copies of Mommy
for the whole school.

97
00:05:23,508 --> 00:05:26,136
- Fuck you.
- Hey! Tough guy!

98
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:30,670
Think she'd suck my dick for a quarter
and let me suck her tits?

99
00:05:30,748 --> 00:05:34,514
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Don't fucking yell in my face, you bitch!

100
00:05:36,721 --> 00:05:38,916
Fuck off!

101
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,015
What the hell is going on here?

102
00:05:41,092 --> 00:05:42,081
Break it up!

103
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,559
I said break it up!

104
00:05:43,628 --> 00:05:46,153
You over there,
you over there, you there.

105
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,562
- He started it.
- Shut up!

106
00:05:48,633 --> 00:05:49,691
Fuck you.

107
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,328
What did you say, son?

108
00:05:53,404 --> 00:05:56,066
I said fuck you.

109
00:05:56,574 --> 00:05:58,269
Fuck me?

110
00:05:59,177 --> 00:06:01,668
Come here.
Come here.

111
00:06:01,746 --> 00:06:03,111
- My bag!
- Grab it!

112
00:06:04,115 --> 00:06:08,347
Again? Again? Jesus, what is it with you
and this goddamn school?

113
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:10,114
I cannot keep coming down here like this.

114
00:06:10,188 --> 00:06:12,213
Look, Miss Myers,

115
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:16,556
I do not enjoy calling you down here
every five minutes.

116
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:18,925
Really?
It sure seems like you fucking do.

117
00:06:18,996 --> 00:06:21,089
Can't you get control
over your school, principal?

118
00:06:21,165 --> 00:06:24,430
Yes, I can get control.
I can control my school.

119
00:06:24,502 --> 00:06:27,300
There's something you gotta know.

120
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:36,037
Will you just relax a moment?
Please sit down and let me talk to you.

121
00:06:36,113 --> 00:06:38,308
- Please. Please.
- Okay. What?

122
00:06:38,382 --> 00:06:40,441
Please, sit down.

123
00:06:40,518 --> 00:06:43,351
- Thank God.
- Hi, Jim. How are you?

124
00:06:43,421 --> 00:06:44,445
Is this her?

125
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:49,287
Miss Myers, this is Dr. Loomis.
I took the liberty of calling him in.

126
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,821
- Happens to be a child psychologist--
- Thank you, Jim.

127
00:06:51,896 --> 00:06:53,193
Psychologist?

128
00:06:53,264 --> 00:06:54,595
May I ask you,

129
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:57,998
has your son ever had any kind
of serious psychiatric evaluation?

130
00:06:58,069 --> 00:07:00,537
Okay, I've had enough.
This is crazy.

131
00:07:00,605 --> 00:07:02,266
- Miss Myers, please.
- I gotta get back to work.

132
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,807
- I gotta go.
- Please, ma'am.

133
00:07:03,874 --> 00:07:06,638
We only want the best for the child.
Please don't take offense.

134
00:07:06,711 --> 00:07:08,303
Please, sit down. Sit down.

135
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:09,403
Thank you.

136
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,142
Look, uh, Miss Myers...

137
00:07:12,216 --> 00:07:13,877
we found this...

138
00:07:13,951 --> 00:07:15,748
in Michael's school bag.

139
00:07:17,722 --> 00:07:20,156
Come on. Big deal.
He found a dead cat.

140
00:07:22,226 --> 00:07:23,557
And these.

141
00:07:24,595 --> 00:07:26,119
What is that?

142
00:07:26,197 --> 00:07:28,358
I hope you're not squeamish, Mrs. Myers.

143
00:07:29,467 --> 00:07:31,731
Oh, God.

144
00:07:31,802 --> 00:07:33,770
Oh, this is really sick.

145
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,699
Are you saying Michael did this?

146
00:07:39,243 --> 00:07:40,801
Michael loves animals. He--

147
00:07:43,581 --> 00:07:45,014
Why would he do this?

148
00:07:45,082 --> 00:07:50,577
Mrs. Myers, typically the thrill of hurting
or causing pain to smaller creatures,

149
00:07:50,655 --> 00:07:53,089
it's often an early warning sign.

150
00:07:53,157 --> 00:07:54,715
Early warning sign for what?

151
00:07:57,361 --> 00:07:59,556
For much deeper and bigger problems.

152
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,962
What do you mean problems?
What is this?

153
00:08:02,033 --> 00:08:04,695
He's a very disturbed young man.

154
00:08:04,769 --> 00:08:08,603
I have to evaluate him,
and I'd like to interview him.

155
00:08:08,673 --> 00:08:11,574
I need to take him
through a series of tests.

156
00:08:11,642 --> 00:08:13,269
Well, you can talk to him,
but what does--

157
00:08:13,344 --> 00:08:15,073
what does evaluating him--
what does that mean?

158
00:08:15,146 --> 00:08:19,242
Obviously, he's a very deranged
young mind that can do this to his pets.

159
00:08:19,317 --> 00:08:21,285
You don't know that he did that.

160
00:08:23,654 --> 00:08:26,987
Fuck, man, if I get one more fucking detention,
I'll be fucking expelled.

161
00:08:27,058 --> 00:08:28,457
My old man's gonna beat my ass.

162
00:08:28,526 --> 00:08:31,518
We gotta get that piece of shit
on the weekend so we don't get in trouble.

163
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:33,620
Dude, if I see that Myers pussy,
he's fucking dead.

164
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,569
You want it?

165
00:08:50,648 --> 00:08:52,172
Huh? Do you want it?

166
00:09:31,922 --> 00:09:33,287
Aah!

167
00:09:33,357 --> 00:09:34,881
Ow!

168
00:09:37,928 --> 00:09:39,327
What the fuck?

169
00:09:39,397 --> 00:09:42,161
Oh, you're so fucking dead.

170
00:09:47,471 --> 00:09:49,632
Oh, please stop.

171
00:09:49,707 --> 00:09:50,765
Stop!

172
00:10:07,525 --> 00:10:08,549
Please.

173
00:10:18,969 --> 00:10:21,733
Please.
Please no!

174
00:10:21,806 --> 00:10:23,364
I'm sorry.

175
00:10:25,843 --> 00:10:28,812
Don't hurt me. Just-- I'm sorry.

176
00:10:32,616 --> 00:10:34,743
No, no, no, don't.
Don't. Please. Please.

177
00:10:43,994 --> 00:10:46,087
Please.

178
00:10:46,163 --> 00:10:47,892
Don't hurt me.

179
00:10:58,442 --> 00:10:59,568
No.

180
00:11:54,732 --> 00:11:56,029
Hey, clown.

181
00:11:57,201 --> 00:11:58,498
Hey.

182
00:12:00,471 --> 00:12:02,735
Psycho boy.

183
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:04,398
Cat killer.

184
00:12:05,576 --> 00:12:09,342
Do you really torture and kill
all them worthless animals, boy?

185
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:15,880
Make you feel like a real bad-ass
motherfucker killer, huh?

186
00:12:16,954 --> 00:12:18,888
That is some deep-ass,

187
00:12:18,956 --> 00:12:22,414
serious, faggoty-ass shit, man.

188
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:24,461
Judith, I'm gonna be late!

189
00:12:24,528 --> 00:12:28,191
"Judith, I'm gonna be late!"

190
00:12:28,299 --> 00:12:30,961
You really are a whiny little bitch,
you know that?

191
00:12:31,035 --> 00:12:32,662
Ronnie, knock it off.

192
00:12:36,974 --> 00:12:39,272
Ma, Judith is wasting all my time.

193
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:42,244
I really shouldn't even let you go
after that shit you pulled today at school.

194
00:12:42,313 --> 00:12:43,940
Oh, Ma, please?

195
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:45,982
All right, Michael, calm down.

196
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:47,449
Tomorrow things are gonna change
around here,

197
00:12:47,518 --> 00:12:49,145
so I suggest you live it up tonight.

198
00:12:50,454 --> 00:12:52,479
Judith!

199
00:12:53,724 --> 00:12:54,782
Here.

200
00:12:58,295 --> 00:12:59,319
What?

201
00:12:59,396 --> 00:13:01,523
Would you do me a favor and please
take your brother trick-or-treating?

202
00:13:01,599 --> 00:13:04,864
Why don't you have that subhuman sloth
over there on the couch do it?

203
00:13:04,935 --> 00:13:07,927
You know, if I could get that lazy drunk
off his fat ass, I would.

204
00:13:08,005 --> 00:13:12,635
Bitch, if you don't think I ain't making
a mental list of all your fucking bullshit!

205
00:13:14,778 --> 00:13:16,245
Sweetie, look at me.

206
00:13:16,313 --> 00:13:18,076
I know things have been bad,

207
00:13:18,148 --> 00:13:20,776
but tomorrow we start to make
everything better, okay?

208
00:13:22,453 --> 00:13:24,353
- Yeah.

209
00:13:24,421 --> 00:13:27,720
I like your hair curly.
It looks pretty.

210
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:31,124
Thanks, sweetie.
Have fun trick-or-treating, okay?

211
00:13:31,195 --> 00:13:32,628
Don't eat too much candy.

212
00:13:32,696 --> 00:13:33,856
Hey, Mrs. Myers.

213
00:13:33,931 --> 00:13:35,489
I want you out by 11.

214
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:37,761
- What'd I do?
- I know what you do.

215
00:13:37,835 --> 00:13:39,166
Whatever.

216
00:13:40,871 --> 00:13:42,930
What about trick-or-treating?

217
00:13:43,007 --> 00:13:44,941
Are you kidding me?
Go by yourself.

218
00:13:45,009 --> 00:13:47,273
Aren't you too old for that, anyway?

219
00:13:47,344 --> 00:13:48,333
Whatever.

220
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:50,277
Sorry, squirt, but have fun.

221
00:13:50,347 --> 00:13:52,338
Trick or treat!

222
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,407

Hold up, man.

That fucking drunk-prick fuck Ronnie
ain't my dad.

240
00:15:15,599 --> 00:15:17,658
Okay, l-- I didn't know.

241
00:15:17,735 --> 00:15:19,896
My daddy's in heaven, okay?

00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:21,870
Okay.

I'm sorry.

244
00:15:24,441 --> 00:15:25,908
Close your eyes.

245
00:15:30,247 --> 00:15:32,272
Keep them closed, all right?

246
00:15:33,584 --> 00:15:35,484
I got a surprise for you.

247
00:15:39,623 --> 00:15:40,647
Open.

248
00:15:40,724 --> 00:15:42,749
Aaarrrgghhh!

249
00:15:42,826 --> 00:15:45,727
Aaahh!

250
00:15:45,796 --> 00:15:47,354
- Wow.
- What?

251
00:15:47,431 --> 00:15:48,728
Take that stupid thing off.

252
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:51,563
Oh, come on, babe.
I want to do it with the mask on.

253
00:20:22,506 --> 00:20:23,803
Uhh!

254
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:37,186
Uhh! Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!

255
00:22:07,444 --> 00:22:09,571
Steve, stop it.

256
00:22:11,615 --> 00:22:12,673
Stop.

257
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:13,909
Once a night is enough.

258
00:22:13,984 --> 00:22:15,918
Stop it.

259
00:22:17,454 --> 00:22:18,921
Michael?

260
00:22:19,856 --> 00:22:22,484
Michael, what the fuck
are you doing in here?

261
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,584
Answer me.
Michael.

262
00:22:24,661 --> 00:22:26,390
Michael!

263
00:22:26,463 --> 00:22:27,452
Answer me!

264
00:22:27,531 --> 00:22:30,466
What the fuck--
Michael!

265
00:22:30,534 --> 00:22:31,831
Answer--

266
00:24:20,844 --> 00:24:22,471
Happy Halloween, Boo.

267
00:24:45,368 --> 00:24:47,063
Jesus, what the hell happened now?

268
00:24:50,373 --> 00:24:52,705
Sweetie, what are you doing out here?

269
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,475
It's freezing.

270
00:24:55,545 --> 00:24:57,172
Michael, what's going on?

271
00:24:58,682 --> 00:25:00,741
Michael, answer me.

272
00:25:02,952 --> 00:25:04,419
Give me the baby.

273
00:25:05,822 --> 00:25:07,619
Michael, what is going on?

274
00:25:07,691 --> 00:25:09,056
Answer me.

275
00:25:22,472 --> 00:25:26,272
...in connection
with tonight's brutal murders.

276
00:25:30,814 --> 00:25:32,338
...the Myers family,

277
00:25:32,415 --> 00:25:35,475
and was described by police
as Manson-like in its viciousness,

278
00:25:35,552 --> 00:25:39,352
and more horrific than anything
Hollywood could imagine.

279
00:25:41,358 --> 00:25:44,555
Judith Myers' nude body
was found lying face-down

280
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:47,061
in a pool of blood in an upstairs hallway.

281
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:50,156
Apparently she had been stabbed 17 times.

282
00:25:50,233 --> 00:25:55,102
Her boyfriend Steven Haley's body
was found in the kitchen downstairs,

283
00:25:55,171 --> 00:25:59,665
the victim of an apparent vicious beating
with an aluminum baseball bat.

284
00:25:59,743 --> 00:26:00,937
Along with Myers and Haley,

285
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:02,978
a third victim, Ronnie White,

286
00:26:03,046 --> 00:26:04,843
who was found bound to a chair,

287
00:26:04,914 --> 00:26:07,940
White's neck slit wide open
with a kitchen knife

288
00:26:08,017 --> 00:26:11,180
and stabbed numerous times
in the face and chest.

289
00:26:11,254 --> 00:26:14,655
Of course we'll have much more
on this horrific story as it develops.

290
00:26:14,724 --> 00:26:17,488
But for now,
three people brutally murdered,

291
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:21,758
and a 10-year-old boy, Michael Myers,
being held in custody.

292
00:26:43,686 --> 00:26:46,553
<i>I'm standing outside
Smith's Grove Sanitarium</i>

293
00:26:46,623 --> 00:26:47,954
<i>where late last night,</i>

294
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:50,754
<i>10-year-old Michael Myers was transferred</i>

295
00:26:50,827 --> 00:26:53,022
<i>after being found guilty
of first-degree murder.</i>

296
00:26:53,096 --> 00:26:55,690
<i>Myers' verdict comes
after one of the lengthiest</i>

297
00:26:55,765 --> 00:26:58,359
<i>and most expensive trials
in the state's history.</i>

298
00:26:58,435 --> 00:27:01,836
<i>In attendance during this trial,
Dr. Samuel Loomis.</i>

299
00:27:01,905 --> 00:27:04,305
<i>Loomis has now been appointed
by Judge Masterson</i>

300
00:27:04,374 --> 00:27:08,208
<i>to oversee Myers' care
while incarcerated here at Smith's Grove.</i>

301
00:27:09,979 --> 00:27:11,037
Hello, hello, hello.

302
00:27:11,114 --> 00:27:12,741
Can you talk in there?

303
00:27:12,816 --> 00:27:14,181
Hi, I'm Michael Myers.

304
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,547
Okay, okay. That's fine.

305
00:27:15,618 --> 00:27:18,553
That's good. That's good.
Okay, we're on.

306
00:27:18,621 --> 00:27:20,418
How are you feeling today?

307
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:21,479
Good.

308
00:27:23,493 --> 00:27:25,859
Could I ask you something?

309
00:27:25,929 --> 00:27:28,124
You can ask me
whatever you want.

310
00:27:28,198 --> 00:27:29,665
That's why I'm here.

311
00:27:29,732 --> 00:27:33,168
If you have anything on your mind,
feel free-- anything.

312
00:27:33,236 --> 00:27:34,703
Okay.

313
00:27:34,771 --> 00:27:36,898
Why do you talk so funny?

314
00:27:37,941 --> 00:27:38,999
Talk so funny?

315
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:43,011
Tell me, Michael,

316
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:45,570
what do you remember about...

317
00:27:45,648 --> 00:27:47,843
that night, Halloween?

318
00:27:50,386 --> 00:27:53,253
What do you mean,
like my costume and candy?

319
00:27:54,691 --> 00:27:57,592
So you remember nothing
about the killing?

320
00:27:59,762 --> 00:28:02,560
You remember nothing
about getting a knife?

321
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,161
- I didn't do that.
- Oh, okay.

322
00:28:06,236 --> 00:28:08,534
But you were covered in blood.
Whose blood was it?

323
00:28:08,605 --> 00:28:09,765
I don't know.

324
00:28:09,906 --> 00:28:12,340
Case: Michael Myers.

325
00:28:12,408 --> 00:28:17,368
To the untrained eye,
there's nothing visually abnormal

326
00:28:17,447 --> 00:28:21,816
with this angelic young boy,
but one must remember not to be fooled

327
00:28:21,885 --> 00:28:25,116
by his calm, unassuming facade.

328
00:28:25,188 --> 00:28:26,883
Can I go home today?

329
00:28:26,956 --> 00:28:29,049
No, not today.

330
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:30,956
Tomorrow?

331
00:28:31,027 --> 00:28:33,825
I don't know.
I have to talk to the doctor about that.

332
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:39,563
- Hey, Mommy.
- Yeah.

333
00:28:39,636 --> 00:28:42,002
Is everyone at home okay?

334
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:48,504
Everything's okay at home.

335
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:51,006
Okay.

336
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:21,599
Hey, Mikey.

337
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:23,270
How you doing?

338
00:29:24,847 --> 00:29:28,613
Look, you can't let those walls
get you down.

339
00:29:28,685 --> 00:29:30,653
Believe me, I know.

340
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,620
I spent a little time behind walls.

341
00:29:34,057 --> 00:29:36,821
I know they can drive you crazy.

342
00:29:36,893 --> 00:29:38,793
You gotta look beyond the walls.

343
00:29:38,861 --> 00:29:42,592
You know,
learn to live inside your head.

344
00:29:42,665 --> 00:29:45,532
Hey, there's no walls
that can stop you there.

345
00:29:47,203 --> 00:29:49,637
All right, I gotta get back to work.

346
00:29:49,706 --> 00:29:51,503
Now you take it easy, Mikey.

347
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:02,442
Look at my mask.

348
00:30:03,553 --> 00:30:06,044
Oh, wow. Beautiful. Yeah.

349
00:30:06,956 --> 00:30:09,356
Why is it all black?

350
00:30:09,859 --> 00:30:11,588
'Cause it's one of my favorite colors.

351
00:30:11,661 --> 00:30:14,221
Well, actually black isn't a color, is it?

352
00:30:14,297 --> 00:30:16,197
It's the absence of color.

353
00:30:16,265 --> 00:30:18,756
In the spectrum of colors,

354
00:30:18,835 --> 00:30:21,235
you go from black,
which is no color,

355
00:30:21,304 --> 00:30:24,137
all the way through to white,

356
00:30:24,207 --> 00:30:26,072
which is every color.

357
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:29,307
So technically--

358
00:30:29,379 --> 00:30:33,042
not that it really matters--
but black isn't a color.

359
00:30:34,417 --> 00:30:35,941
Why did you make it?

360
00:30:36,019 --> 00:30:37,281
I have my secrets.

361
00:30:37,353 --> 00:30:39,753
Wait a minute.

362
00:30:39,822 --> 00:30:43,053
I thought we had no secrets,
you and I.

363
00:30:43,126 --> 00:30:44,388
Because no one sees me.

364
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,451
Yes, they do.
I see you every day.

365
00:30:46,529 --> 00:30:49,930
Your mom, she comes every week.

366
00:30:49,999 --> 00:30:52,695
Anybody else?

367
00:30:54,103 --> 00:30:55,092
No.

368
00:30:55,171 --> 00:30:57,298
<i>Michael has begun to obsess</i>

369
00:30:57,373 --> 00:31:00,672
<i>on the construction
of these primitive masks.</i>

370
00:31:00,743 --> 00:31:03,211
<i>It is the rare occasion
that he will allow himself</i>

371
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,110
<i>to be seen without one of these.</i>

372
00:31:05,181 --> 00:31:07,376
<i>Only during the weekly visits
from his mother</i>

373
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:11,477
<i>does he show brief glimpses of the boy
he once may have been.</i>

374
00:31:20,096 --> 00:31:21,927
Do you like my mask?

375
00:31:24,267 --> 00:31:25,894
When did you make this?

376
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:27,458
Just yesterday.

377
00:31:29,072 --> 00:31:32,235
I like the mask because it hides my face.

378
00:31:33,843 --> 00:31:36,073
I don't like you to hide your face.

379
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:37,612
Take it off.

380
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,477
It hides my ugliness.

381
00:31:40,616 --> 00:31:42,709
Sweetie, don't say that.
Take it off.

382
00:31:42,785 --> 00:31:44,275
You're not ugly.

383
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:47,517
Don't talk like that, okay?

384
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,852
Okay.

385
00:31:51,728 --> 00:31:53,559
I miss you so much.

386
00:31:53,629 --> 00:31:55,153
I miss you, too.

387
00:32:13,549 --> 00:32:16,347
<i>Michael's so-called normal moments</i>

388
00:32:16,419 --> 00:32:17,852
<i>are becoming fewer and fewer,</i>

389
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,252
<i>and I'm particularly worried about this.</i>

390
00:32:20,323 --> 00:32:24,919
<i>I believe that these masks have
begun to create a mental sanctuary</i>

391
00:32:24,994 --> 00:32:29,522
<i>in which Michael can hide
within himself and from himself.</i>

392
00:32:29,699 --> 00:32:35,660
# Deck the halls with boughs of holly,
Fa la la la la, la la la la #

393
00:32:35,738 --> 00:32:38,605
Fuck you! Fuck you all!

394
00:32:38,674 --> 00:32:40,369
- I hate you!
- Let it out!

395
00:32:40,443 --> 00:32:42,035
Shut the fuck up!

396
00:32:42,111 --> 00:32:44,011
I gotta get out of here.

397
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,311
Just let me out!
I hate this world!

398
00:32:47,383 --> 00:32:50,045
- I don't want to be here anymore.
- I know. It's okay.

399
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:52,314
- I just want to go home.
- It's okay. It's okay.

400
00:32:52,388 --> 00:32:53,616
It's okay.

401
00:32:54,757 --> 00:32:57,021
Why can't I just go home?

402
00:32:57,093 --> 00:32:58,424
Okay.

403
00:32:58,494 --> 00:33:00,894
Okay. Okay. Okay.

404
00:33:00,963 --> 00:33:02,487
I'm afraid you can't go home.

405
00:33:02,565 --> 00:33:04,499
Why?

406
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:06,262
Because you've done terrible things.

407
00:33:10,406 --> 00:33:12,271
Come here. Come on.

408
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:16,344
It's okay. It's okay, Michael.

409
00:33:16,412 --> 00:33:18,175
<i>Michael's downward slide</i>

410
00:33:18,247 --> 00:33:20,977
<i>into this hellish abyss continues.</i>

411
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:24,713
<i>I fear he's on the verge
of completely shutting down.</i>

412
00:33:24,787 --> 00:33:28,723
I managed to persuade the suits
to let you come outside

413
00:33:28,791 --> 00:33:30,554
and sit out in the garden.

414
00:33:30,626 --> 00:33:32,560
All right, gardens.

415
00:33:32,628 --> 00:33:36,962
Hardly a charming place,
but at least there's a bit of greenery.

416
00:33:37,033 --> 00:33:40,002
But please, I mean,
if you don't communicate with me,

417
00:33:40,069 --> 00:33:41,832
how can I help you?

418
00:33:41,904 --> 00:33:43,895
I'm here to help you.

419
00:33:43,973 --> 00:33:46,874
I feel an utter failure at the moment,

420
00:33:46,943 --> 00:33:49,810
that I just can't get through to you.

421
00:33:49,879 --> 00:33:52,609
And you know, they're going
to see in my reports

422
00:33:52,682 --> 00:33:54,912
that you're not responding, and--

423
00:33:54,984 --> 00:33:57,179
you know, they may
take me off the case.

424
00:33:57,253 --> 00:33:59,050
I don't know. I hope not.

425
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:01,954
I need to get out of here.

426
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,956
Yes, that's not going to happen
for a while, Michael.

427
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,068
Michael, take off the mask.

428
00:34:16,405 --> 00:34:18,999
Honey, you don't look good.
You have to eat. Come on.

429
00:34:20,509 --> 00:34:23,376
- Put my mask back on.
- Michael.

430
00:34:23,446 --> 00:34:25,573
Please put my mask back on.

431
00:34:27,884 --> 00:34:30,876
Come on.
Let's try to enjoy the day.

432
00:34:32,188 --> 00:34:34,156
<i>[Loomis]
The child christened Michael Myers</i>

433
00:34:34,223 --> 00:34:36,316
<i>has become a sort of ghost,</i>

434
00:34:36,392 --> 00:34:39,691
<i>a mere shape of a human being.</i>

435
00:34:39,762 --> 00:34:41,923
<i>There's nothing left here now.</i>

436
00:35:06,088 --> 00:35:10,422
Well, before I go,
I brought you something.

437
00:35:13,229 --> 00:35:16,392
I found it. I thought you might like
to hang it up in your room.

438
00:35:17,967 --> 00:35:19,491
I thought you'd like it.

439
00:35:29,979 --> 00:35:31,640
Well, I guess I'll see you next week.

440
00:35:31,714 --> 00:35:33,306
I'll walk you to the car.

441
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,785
Bye, sweetie.

442
00:35:40,222 --> 00:35:43,658
Nurse, sit with Michael.
I'm taking Mrs. Myers to her car.

443
00:35:43,726 --> 00:35:45,421
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

444
00:35:58,507 --> 00:35:59,496
Cute baby.

445
00:36:04,513 --> 00:36:06,504
Couldn't be related to you.

446
00:36:18,728 --> 00:36:22,129
You know, he's been silent now
for two weeks almost.

447
00:36:22,198 --> 00:36:25,759
We really may want to consider
maybe shock treatments.

448
00:36:33,609 --> 00:36:35,304
What happened?
What happened?

449
00:36:35,378 --> 00:36:36,743
What happened there?

450
00:36:36,812 --> 00:36:37,836
Hey!

451
00:38:39,368 --> 00:38:42,030
So you don't fucking talk a lot,
do you, Max?

452
00:38:43,606 --> 00:38:45,506
Goddamn it, we're gonna get
one thing straight.

453
00:38:45,574 --> 00:38:47,201
I don't work for you.

454
00:38:47,276 --> 00:38:49,403
You may have worked here
for many years

455
00:38:49,478 --> 00:38:50,809
and done all manner of things,

456
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,178
and I suppose that's because
you're a hard worker.

457
00:38:53,249 --> 00:38:55,012
Most of you people are.

458
00:38:55,084 --> 00:38:57,211
All your women keep
your little bungalows clean,

459
00:38:57,286 --> 00:38:59,186
sweep off the dirt floors--

460
00:38:59,255 --> 00:39:01,120
keep the papooses in order and all--

461
00:39:01,257 --> 00:39:04,249
but I'm my own boss, all right?

462
00:39:04,326 --> 00:39:06,624
I retire in about three months,

463
00:39:06,695 --> 00:39:09,220
and you're still gonna be here
for a long time.

464
00:39:09,298 --> 00:39:11,232
Now open the door.

465
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:14,064
Don't take no orders from anybody.

466
00:39:18,073 --> 00:39:21,042
Let's go, fuck-nut. Time to go.

467
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:31,142
- Hey! Don't touch those.
- What?

468
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,518
He doesn't like it
when you touch the masks.

469
00:39:33,589 --> 00:39:36,114
God damn, I wouldn't want
the bum to freak out.

470
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:38,524
Sorry about these chains, Mikey.

471
00:39:38,594 --> 00:39:41,119
What do you mean,
you're sorry about these chains?

472
00:39:41,197 --> 00:39:43,427
You got feelings for this big idiot,
is that what it is?

473
00:39:43,499 --> 00:39:46,400
What's the dig goin' on, Ismael?
What the fuck, man?

474
00:39:46,468 --> 00:39:50,370
You know what? I've been taking care
of this kid for almost 20 years.

475
00:39:50,439 --> 00:39:52,066
And me and him--

476
00:39:52,141 --> 00:39:53,768
You know what? Never mind.
Just shut up, man.

477
00:39:53,842 --> 00:39:55,776
Just keep your hands off his things.

478
00:39:55,844 --> 00:39:57,277
Don't look at me.

479
00:39:57,346 --> 00:40:00,838
I'll be a shitstorm
in your worst nightmare, motherfucker.

480
00:40:00,916 --> 00:40:04,044
I'll come in here and fuck this place up
one night, you watch.

481
00:40:13,462 --> 00:40:17,091
I really don't know what else to say, Michael.

482
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:21,432
You haven't said a word for 15 years.

483
00:40:21,503 --> 00:40:24,370
Christ, that's a lifetime.

484
00:40:26,108 --> 00:40:30,772
That's nearly twice as long
as my first marriage.

485
00:40:30,846 --> 00:40:32,973
Wow.

486
00:40:33,048 --> 00:40:34,845
It's strange, Michael.

487
00:40:37,353 --> 00:40:39,981
In a weird way, you've become like...

488
00:40:41,657 --> 00:40:43,648
...like my best friend.

489
00:40:45,928 --> 00:40:48,795
It just shows you how fucked up my life is.

490
00:40:50,966 --> 00:40:54,333
I've done all I possibly can for you.

491
00:40:54,403 --> 00:40:58,134
So I'm sorry to tell you

492
00:40:58,207 --> 00:41:00,835
that this is going to be my last day.

493
00:41:00,909 --> 00:41:03,036
Michael...

494
00:41:03,145 --> 00:41:04,442
I have to move on.

495
00:41:06,615 --> 00:41:08,310
I'm sorry.

496
00:41:24,466 --> 00:41:26,434
Take care, Michael.

497
00:41:29,738 --> 00:41:31,365
Take care.

498
00:41:54,163 --> 00:41:56,529
These eyes will deceive you.

499
00:41:58,867 --> 00:42:01,768
They will destroy you.

500
00:42:01,837 --> 00:42:05,534
They will take from you your innocence...

501
00:42:05,607 --> 00:42:07,837
your pride...

502
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:11,038
and eventually your soul.

503
00:42:11,113 --> 00:42:16,278
These eyes do not see
what you and I see.

504
00:42:18,153 --> 00:42:23,318
Behind these eyes
one finds only blackness,

505
00:42:23,392 --> 00:42:26,384
the absence of light.

506
00:42:26,462 --> 00:42:30,660
These are the eyes...

507
00:42:30,733 --> 00:42:33,395
of a psychopath.

508
00:42:33,469 --> 00:42:35,369
Michael was created

509
00:42:35,437 --> 00:42:37,632
by a perfect alignment

510
00:42:37,706 --> 00:42:40,869
of interior and exterior factors

511
00:42:40,943 --> 00:42:43,537
gone violently wrong--

512
00:42:43,612 --> 00:42:48,379
a perfect storm, if you will.

513
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:51,146
Thus creating a psychopath

514
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:53,950
that knows no boundaries...

515
00:42:54,022 --> 00:42:57,048
and has no boundaries.

516
00:43:04,633 --> 00:43:06,430
Kendall, I really don't appreciate

517
00:43:06,502 --> 00:43:08,265
being called out of
my favorite watering hole

518
00:43:08,337 --> 00:43:10,635
to come down on
the fuckin' graveyard shift.

519
00:43:10,706 --> 00:43:13,504
If you do me dirt on this one,
I'll fuckin' hold it against you.

520
00:43:13,575 --> 00:43:15,770
Hey, you know what? I'll fuck her.
You don't want to fuck her?

521
00:43:15,844 --> 00:43:17,869
I'll fuck her. Right here.

522
00:43:23,485 --> 00:43:26,181
Mikey, Mikey, Mikey.

523
00:43:26,255 --> 00:43:28,746
Here we go.
I want you to meet Cousin Noel.

524
00:43:33,028 --> 00:43:35,690
- Hi, there, sweetie. Hi.
- Huh?

525
00:43:35,764 --> 00:43:37,664
Oh, we're just here to look in on you.

526
00:43:37,733 --> 00:43:39,963
We know it's your first night and all.

527
00:43:40,035 --> 00:43:42,936
We just want to see how you are. Oh!

528
00:43:43,005 --> 00:43:45,269
- Aren't you a pretty little thing?
- Not bad, huh?

529
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:46,967
We're just makin' sure everything's okay.

530
00:43:47,042 --> 00:43:49,567
Oh, now, we're okay. Hey.
Ooh, look at those little titties.

531
00:43:49,645 --> 00:43:51,078
You're right!
Oh, look at there.

532
00:43:51,246 --> 00:43:52,372
- What else is under there?

533
00:43:52,448 --> 00:43:54,848
No, no, no, no, no.
Oh, yeah! Whoo!

534
00:43:54,917 --> 00:43:56,748
We got ourselves a fighter!

535
00:43:56,819 --> 00:43:58,309
A fresh one!
You done good, cousin.

536
00:43:58,387 --> 00:43:59,513
Hah-hah!

537
00:43:59,588 --> 00:44:00,919
- I got an idea.
- Okay.

538
00:44:00,989 --> 00:44:04,891
I got me a fuckin' bona fide,
sure as shit idea!

539
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,554
- Keep her fuckin' quiet.
- God, shut up.

540
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:14,425
Oh, Mikey, Mikey, Mikey, Mikey, Mikey.

541
00:44:14,503 --> 00:44:15,868
Hello, Mike!

542
00:44:18,474 --> 00:44:20,965
Hey, Mikey. We brought you
a little company.

543
00:44:21,043 --> 00:44:23,375
Yeah, we got you
some new, fresh meat, baby.

544
00:44:23,445 --> 00:44:25,913
Fuckin' bitch.
You want some of that?

545
00:44:25,981 --> 00:44:27,915
- Come on, baby!

546
00:44:27,983 --> 00:44:29,450
- Show us you're a man, huh?

547
00:44:29,518 --> 00:44:31,145
You want some fuckin' pussy?

548
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:33,518
Yeah.

549
00:44:33,589 --> 00:44:35,580
You want some fuckin' pussy, huh?

550
00:44:37,059 --> 00:44:40,324
Yeah. Mm, that's good.
How 'bout some of that, killer?

551
00:44:40,395 --> 00:44:41,521
He ain't gonna do it.
Let me lick--

552
00:44:43,265 --> 00:44:44,527
Let me just--

553
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,067
- You wanna fuckin' fight, huh?

554
00:44:46,134 --> 00:44:48,898
- Come on, bitch.
- Fuck the shit outta her.

555
00:44:48,971 --> 00:44:51,064
- Come on! Get on her!
- Yeah, baby!

556
00:45:10,259 --> 00:45:12,193
You fucking tard-ass faggot, come on!

557
00:45:12,261 --> 00:45:13,455
Yeah!

558
00:45:20,135 --> 00:45:21,568
You a faggot, boy?

559
00:45:25,407 --> 00:45:27,034
You a faggot, huh?

560
00:45:28,744 --> 00:45:29,836
What the fuck?

561
00:45:29,912 --> 00:45:32,403
Hey, you son of a bitch!

562
00:45:32,481 --> 00:45:34,005
Son of a bitch!
Let him go.

563
00:45:34,082 --> 00:45:35,606
Kendall!

564
00:45:38,453 --> 00:45:40,614
What the fuck, Mikey?
It's Kendall.

565
00:45:42,024 --> 00:45:43,218
It's Kendall, Mikey.

566
00:46:46,888 --> 00:46:48,549
Gloria?

568
00:47:33,835 --> 00:47:37,293
Mikey, what are you doing
out of your room?

569
00:47:39,508 --> 00:47:40,668
Okay...

570
00:47:42,778 --> 00:47:44,746
Now, don't do nothing

571
00:47:44,813 --> 00:47:48,112
we're both gonna regret later,
okay, Mikey?

572
00:47:48,183 --> 00:47:51,311
I'm gonna have to get you back
into your room, okay now?

573
00:47:52,587 --> 00:47:54,817
Let me get these.

574
00:47:54,890 --> 00:47:56,619
I'm just gonna...

575
00:47:56,692 --> 00:47:58,660
get these handcuffs and...

576
00:48:00,228 --> 00:48:02,458
I'm gonna try to put these handcuffs
on you right now, Mikey.

577
00:48:02,531 --> 00:48:05,500
And then we'll get you back
into your own bed, okay?

578
00:48:19,815 --> 00:48:20,907
Mikey!

579
00:48:26,488 --> 00:48:28,683
I was good to you, Mikey.

580
00:48:42,838 --> 00:48:45,068
I was good to you, Mikey.

581
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:46,289
Hello.

582
00:49:46,368 --> 00:49:48,393

583
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:49,732
Sam, it's Koplenson.

584
00:49:51,773 --> 00:49:52,762
Who?

585
00:49:52,841 --> 00:49:55,503
<i>Dr. Koplenson from Smith's Grove.</i>

586
00:49:55,577 --> 00:49:57,306
He's out.

587
00:49:57,379 --> 00:49:58,403
Michael's out.

588
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:01,176
Shit. What?

589
00:50:01,249 --> 00:50:04,377
He broke out a few hours ago.

590
00:50:04,452 --> 00:50:07,444
Sam, it's a--
it's a fucking massacre.

591
00:50:09,324 --> 00:50:11,884
I'm coming right away.
All right.

592
00:50:13,762 --> 00:50:15,161
Oh, shit.

Gotta leave the truck.

598
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,351
All right, boys.

599
00:50:47,429 --> 00:50:50,694
Grizzley's back in town.
Who's got the Cracker Jacks?

600
00:50:50,765 --> 00:50:52,790
Grizzley's back!

601
00:50:52,868 --> 00:50:54,495
All right!

00:50:54,569 --> 00:50:55,729
Look it here.

603
00:50:55,804 --> 00:50:57,601
That's a new paint job.

604
00:50:57,672 --> 00:51:00,300
Don't mess it up. Don't scratch it.

605
00:51:06,081 --> 00:51:07,309
Yeah.

606
00:51:11,386 --> 00:51:13,149
Oh, man.

Naughty, naughty girl.

612
00:51:54,896 --> 00:51:58,354
Hey, buddy,
just to give you a heads up,

613
00:51:58,433 --> 00:52:02,130
I got a taco deluxe supreme
talking back at me,

614
00:52:02,203 --> 00:52:03,568
so I'm going to be a while.

615
00:52:03,638 --> 00:52:08,803
So do you mind waiting somewhere else
and let me pass this beast in peace?

616
00:52:17,485 --> 00:52:20,318
Look, brother...

617
00:52:20,388 --> 00:52:22,185
if you're looking for some kind of action,

618
00:52:22,257 --> 00:52:26,523
you better take it on the arches
before I'm done dropping this load.

619
00:52:26,594 --> 00:52:29,461
Or you're going to be one sorry A-hole.

620
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,992
I see.

621
00:52:34,069 --> 00:52:38,096
What we got here is...

622
00:52:38,173 --> 00:52:40,437
a failure to communicate.

623
00:52:42,677 --> 00:52:46,579
You just hold on, Daisy.

624
00:52:46,648 --> 00:52:48,639
I've got something for you.

625
00:52:52,053 --> 00:52:54,817
Let me introduce myself.

626
00:52:54,889 --> 00:52:56,789
I'm Joe Grizzley, bitch.

627
00:52:58,693 --> 00:53:01,594
And I'm going to cut that mask

628
00:53:04,399 --> 00:53:05,957
Get-- Get back!

629
00:53:06,034 --> 00:53:07,661
I ain't scared!

630
00:53:22,417 --> 00:53:24,476

Mason, Laurie!

633
00:54:08,229 --> 00:54:10,424
- Morning.

634
00:54:10,498 --> 00:54:12,989
Where are my goddamn glasses?

635
00:54:13,068 --> 00:54:14,899
- Jesus, Cynth, I'm gonna be late.
- On your head.

636
00:54:14,969 --> 00:54:16,994
- Oh, sh-- I'm gonna lose my mind.
- Move.

637
00:54:17,072 --> 00:54:18,266
Excuse me.

638
00:54:21,176 --> 00:54:23,235
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Now what?

639
00:54:23,311 --> 00:54:26,007
It says here Nickel's Hardware
is going out of business.

640
00:54:26,081 --> 00:54:28,515
42 years and that's it, over and done.

641
00:54:28,583 --> 00:54:31,074
Yeah, well, good. They're a rip-off.

642
00:54:31,152 --> 00:54:34,383
And Mr. Nickels is a horny old pervert.

643
00:54:34,456 --> 00:54:36,788
Okay, don't even want to know.

644
00:54:36,858 --> 00:54:38,052
Guess what, Mom.

645
00:54:38,126 --> 00:54:41,152
Mr. Nickels likes to touch me
the wrong way.

646
00:54:41,229 --> 00:54:43,060
Ooh, whoo, Mommy!

647
00:54:43,131 --> 00:54:44,689
Okay, that is so not funny.

648
00:54:44,766 --> 00:54:46,700
Want a screwdriver, Mommy?
You want a hammer?

649
00:54:47,001 --> 00:54:48,332
Look at this, Mom. Oh!

650
00:54:48,403 --> 00:54:50,200
- Laurie, stop!
- I'm sorry. Okay.

651
00:54:50,271 --> 00:54:52,831
- Are you eating?
- No, I'll get something at school.

652
00:54:52,907 --> 00:54:54,602
- Oh, my God.
- [Dad] Oh, sure.

653
00:54:54,676 --> 00:54:57,941
Just let the faceless marauding
corporate monsters of America

654
00:54:58,012 --> 00:54:59,707
destroy everything
beautiful about this town.

655
00:54:59,781 --> 00:55:03,114
Corporate monsters or not,
Epic Mart's a lot cheaper.

656
00:55:03,184 --> 00:55:05,345
Oh, man, I gotta get out of here.

657
00:55:09,257 --> 00:55:12,249
- Thanks again for dropping that thing off.
- No sweat, Dad.

658
00:55:12,327 --> 00:55:14,887
Just shove the envelope
inside the mail slot, okay?

659
00:55:14,963 --> 00:55:16,191
Yeah, Dad, I know.

660
00:55:16,264 --> 00:55:17,754
They're coming by to look at it later, honey.

661
00:55:17,832 --> 00:55:18,821
- So, it's very important that--
- Dad, okay.

662
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:21,130
<i>I understand.
Muy importante.</i>

663
00:55:21,202 --> 00:55:22,260
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

00:55:22,337 --> 00:55:23,429
Have a good day.

665
00:55:23,505 --> 00:55:27,271
Mason, you forgot your briefcase, honey.

666
00:55:27,342 --> 00:55:29,503
- Ah, shit.
- Ah, shit.

667
00:55:29,577 --> 00:55:31,010
I feel like "What round is it?"

668
00:55:33,748 --> 00:55:34,874
Yeah.

669
00:55:34,949 --> 00:55:38,942
Oh, uh, you think you could...
glue Mr. Bones' arms on or something?

670
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:42,353
- Have a good day, baby.
- Yeah. Top on my priority list.

671
00:55:45,894 --> 00:55:46,883
Hey, Laurie!

672
00:55:46,961 --> 00:55:48,019
- Wait up!
- Oh, God.

673
00:55:48,096 --> 00:55:50,997
- Leave me alone, Tommy.
- Wait.

674
00:55:51,065 --> 00:55:54,034
Definition: Stop walking.

675
00:55:54,102 --> 00:55:57,469
- Can I ask you something serious?
- Sure, why not?

676
00:55:57,539 --> 00:55:59,905
Did you ever hear
about the Mexican Wolf Man?

677
00:55:59,974 --> 00:56:02,033
- No.
- Yeah, well, he's real.

678
00:56:02,110 --> 00:56:03,634
- I saw him on TV last night...
- Yeah.

679
00:56:03,711 --> 00:56:07,477
And his name's Danny, and his face
is completely covered with hair.

680
00:56:07,549 --> 00:56:09,244
And he likes soccer.
I swear it! They showed--

681
00:56:09,317 --> 00:56:10,375
- Okay.
- He's a wolf!

682
00:56:10,451 --> 00:56:12,715
Tommy, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

683
00:56:12,787 --> 00:56:14,152
Lay off the candy corn, kid.

684
00:56:14,222 --> 00:56:16,747
Stop acting like I'm crazy. It's true!

685
00:56:16,824 --> 00:56:18,849
Tommy, I'm your babysitter.
You're crazy.

686
00:56:18,927 --> 00:56:21,418
- I know this. You're crazy.
- Ooohhh!

687
00:57:47,448 --> 00:57:49,712
All right, gotta make a stop here.

688
00:57:49,784 --> 00:57:52,981
Whoa! What are you, insane?

689
00:57:53,054 --> 00:57:55,488
Oh, my gosh, Tommy,
I'm not even listening to you.

690
00:57:55,556 --> 00:57:57,581
You'd better listen to me.

691
00:57:57,659 --> 00:57:58,853
He's right there.

692
00:57:58,926 --> 00:58:01,019
What are you, crazy?
You can't go in there.

693
00:58:01,095 --> 00:58:02,790
Oh, yes, I can.

694
00:58:02,864 --> 00:58:05,094
Hold my books, please?

695
00:58:06,534 --> 00:58:09,094
That's the devil's house.
The Boogey Man lives in there.

696
00:58:09,170 --> 00:58:11,229
Yeah.
Oh, no, Tommy.

697
00:58:11,306 --> 00:58:13,399
Don't even joke about it.
I'm serious.

698
00:58:13,474 --> 00:58:15,567
Oh, you're scaring me.

699
00:58:15,643 --> 00:58:18,874
The Boogey Man will get me
or Danny the Wolf Man.

700
00:58:25,386 --> 00:58:27,013
Oh, no, Tommy.

701
00:58:27,088 --> 00:58:29,852
Oh, no!

702
00:58:29,924 --> 00:58:31,551
Oh, no, it's pulling me--

703
00:58:31,626 --> 00:58:34,117
Oh, no, Tommy, it's pulling me in!

704
00:58:34,195 --> 00:58:36,129
Ha ha ha.

705
00:58:36,831 --> 00:58:38,298
It was just a joke. Chill.

706
00:58:38,366 --> 00:58:40,266
I wish it wasn't.

707
00:58:40,335 --> 00:58:42,166
Come on, hurry up.

708
00:58:42,236 --> 00:58:44,431
Chill, spazz-monkey.

709
00:58:44,505 --> 00:58:45,699
Thanks.

710
00:58:48,776 --> 00:58:50,744
That's no place to screw around,
Laurie.

711
00:58:50,812 --> 00:58:53,337
- It's not a big deal.
- Not a big deal?

712
00:58:53,414 --> 00:58:55,575
Do you know whose house that is?

713
00:58:55,650 --> 00:58:56,947
Come on.

714
00:58:57,018 --> 00:58:59,111
- It's going to be fine.
- Yeah.

715
00:58:59,187 --> 00:59:00,620
What if something happens?

716
00:59:00,688 --> 00:59:03,452
- Laurie, what is going to happen?
- I don't know.

717
00:59:03,524 --> 00:59:05,185
It's going to be fine.

718
00:59:05,259 --> 00:59:07,489
What is going to be fine?

719
00:59:07,562 --> 00:59:10,895
Annie wants me to pretend
to baby-sit Lindsey Wallace,

720
00:59:10,965 --> 00:59:14,526
then sneak out and dump her with me
so she can go and see Paul.

721
00:59:14,602 --> 00:59:15,967
Sounds like
one of my crafty ideas.

722
00:59:16,037 --> 00:59:17,265
- Yeah.
- I like it.

723
00:59:17,338 --> 00:59:20,205
Anyway, I thought Paul was, like, grounded
for trashing his dad's motorcycle.

724
00:59:20,274 --> 00:59:22,265
Oh, yeah.
No, he was, but he got out of it.

725
00:59:22,343 --> 00:59:23,605
- You know.
- Yeah.

726
00:59:23,678 --> 00:59:25,942
Please?

727
00:59:26,013 --> 00:59:27,378
What if they come home early?

728
00:59:27,448 --> 00:59:30,110
Dude, they are not
going to come home early.

729
00:59:30,184 --> 00:59:31,981
Okay? Mrs. Wallace is a lush.

730
00:59:32,053 --> 00:59:35,045
They're going to be out all night
getting hammered.

731
00:59:35,123 --> 00:59:37,990
Yeah. Annie, I really hate lying.
You know that.

732
00:59:38,059 --> 00:59:40,619
God, what are you, Mother Teresa?

733
00:59:40,695 --> 00:59:42,026
- No.
- Yes, she is.

734
00:59:42,096 --> 00:59:43,723
Look at her.
She's like a little angel.

735
00:59:43,798 --> 00:59:47,632
- She's Mother-fucking Teresa.
- Stop. I am not!

736
00:59:47,702 --> 00:59:49,192
Please?

737
00:59:51,973 --> 00:59:53,907
- All right, I'll do it.
- Yes!

738
00:59:53,975 --> 00:59:55,169
You owe me big time.

739
00:59:55,243 --> 00:59:57,177
- I love you.
- I love you.

740
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:03,280
Did you know that ethyl alcohol
boils at 78.5 degrees Celsius?

741
01:00:03,351 --> 01:00:04,818
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah.

742
01:00:04,886 --> 01:00:06,353
That's pretty cool, right?

743
01:00:07,355 --> 01:00:08,447
Call me back.

744
01:00:11,859 --> 01:00:13,690
This is all your fault.

745
01:00:13,761 --> 01:00:15,592
I mean, you're responsible.

746
01:00:17,031 --> 01:00:22,059
I cannot be responsible
for everything that goes on in here.

747
01:00:22,136 --> 01:00:23,603
- What about you?
- No, no, no, no.

748
01:00:23,671 --> 01:00:25,639
You're not pinning this on me.

749
01:00:25,706 --> 01:00:29,403
- He was your patient, Doctor.
- Was my patient.

750
01:00:29,477 --> 01:00:32,935
Look, all you guys had to do
was to play zoo-keeper.

751
01:00:33,014 --> 01:00:36,472
Just keep the monkeyhouse locked
until the monkey died of old age.

752
01:00:36,551 --> 01:00:38,018
How difficult is that?

753
01:00:38,085 --> 01:00:41,919
Christ, you can barely tell
he's breathing half the time.

754
01:00:41,989 --> 01:00:45,789
He's been like a comatose kitty
for 15 years.

755
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:48,693
If our security wasn't sufficient, Sammy,

756
01:00:48,763 --> 01:00:50,560
you should have warned us.

757
01:00:50,631 --> 01:00:54,897
I see. So you're just going
to wash your hands of the whole thing.

758
01:00:54,969 --> 01:00:57,802
You know, you two make me sick.

759
01:01:05,947 --> 01:01:10,281
"He is mad that trusts
in the tameness of a wolf."

760
01:01:11,986 --> 01:01:14,614
We've given the authorities
his complete profile.

761
01:01:14,689 --> 01:01:18,181
Two road blocks and an all-points bulletin
wouldn't stop a 5-year-old.

762
01:01:18,259 --> 01:01:19,920
Well, what do you want us to do?

763
01:01:19,994 --> 01:01:21,985
Yes. I mean,
what do you want us to do?

764
01:01:23,464 --> 01:01:25,432
I want you to get on the phone,

765
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:29,197
and I want you to tell them
who broke out of here last night.

766
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:32,728
And I want you to tell them
exactly where he's going.

767
01:01:32,807 --> 01:01:34,274
Christ, we don't know where he's going.

768
01:01:34,342 --> 01:01:36,435
It must be great living in denial.

769
01:01:36,511 --> 01:01:38,103
I must try it sometime.

770
01:01:38,179 --> 01:01:41,876
Look, you and that army
of shirt-tuckers up there,

771
01:01:41,949 --> 01:01:43,917
you know damn well where he's going.

772
01:01:45,686 --> 01:01:46,710
And where is that?

773
01:01:50,091 --> 01:01:51,922
Haddonfield!

774
01:01:51,993 --> 01:01:54,757
Haddonfield's a hundred miles
away from here.

775
01:01:56,030 --> 01:01:57,292
This is so fucked.

776
01:01:57,365 --> 01:01:59,492
What, me suspended from the squad?

777
01:01:59,567 --> 01:02:00,761
I don't mean to sound conceited,

778
01:02:00,835 --> 01:02:02,996
but I'm, like, the fucking hottest
cheerleader they've got.

779
01:02:03,070 --> 01:02:04,799
Yeah, Lynda,
that doesn't sound conceited.

780
01:02:04,872 --> 01:02:06,772
What, so now nobody
can take a joke anymore?

781
01:02:06,841 --> 01:02:08,468
- What did you say?
- Check it.

782
01:02:08,543 --> 01:02:11,137
So Lady Fuck-face gives us
three new cheers to learn,

783
01:02:11,212 --> 01:02:15,171
so I'm like, "Hey, why don't we just
rock it commando, flash some snatch?

784
01:02:15,249 --> 01:02:17,308
And maybe nobody will notice
we're doing the same old tired cheers."

785
01:02:17,385 --> 01:02:19,319
- Oh, you didn't.
- Oh, yeah, I did.

786
01:02:19,387 --> 01:02:20,376
- Yeah, you did.
- Yeah.

787
01:02:20,454 --> 01:02:22,149
You know what that
dried-up fucking bitch did?

788
01:02:22,223 --> 01:02:24,919
- What?
- Calls my dad and tells him what I said.

789
01:02:24,992 --> 01:02:25,981
- Yeah.
- Oh, my gosh.

790
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:29,291
That C-U-N-T, yeah,
needs to get laid.

791
01:02:29,363 --> 01:02:30,990
What did your dad say?

792
01:02:31,065 --> 01:02:32,293
Oh, who cares?

793
01:02:32,366 --> 01:02:36,132
I'll just give him the little sweetie-pants
princess suck-up routine.

794
01:02:36,203 --> 01:02:39,434
Daddy's little pookie would never
say something like that.

795
01:02:39,507 --> 01:02:41,270
Gosh, ever since your parents split up,

796
01:02:41,342 --> 01:02:43,401
you have your dad
wrapped around your little finger.

797
01:02:43,477 --> 01:02:45,707
Totally wrapped.

798
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:48,305
- Hey, bitches!
- Hey, Annie.

799
01:02:48,382 --> 01:02:52,045
- Thanks for waiting for me.
- Whatever. Hurry your ass up.

800
01:02:52,119 --> 01:02:53,848
God.

801
01:02:53,921 --> 01:02:57,152
Hey, I heard about your
little cheerleading incident.

802
01:02:57,224 --> 01:02:59,454
Yeah, I'm totally famous.

803
01:02:59,527 --> 01:03:01,154
You're totally a slut.

804
01:03:01,228 --> 01:03:02,752
Yeah.

805
01:03:02,830 --> 01:03:04,661
Anyway, today in class,
in French class,

806
01:03:04,732 --> 01:03:06,700
Mr. Leclerc was totally
flirting with me.

807
01:03:06,767 --> 01:03:10,669
- God, here we go!
- We were conjugating the verb "to want."

808
01:03:10,738 --> 01:03:14,504
<i>- Because he so wants you!
- Je veuxl Je veuxl</i>

809
01:03:14,575 --> 01:03:17,373
- Oh, my gosh.
- Bare Leclerc.

810
01:03:17,445 --> 01:03:19,072
Bare Leclerc wants me.

811
01:03:19,146 --> 01:03:21,046
I think that guy's watching us.

812
01:03:21,115 --> 01:03:22,776
- What guy?
- That guy over there.

813
01:03:22,850 --> 01:03:23,942
Yeah?

814
01:03:24,018 --> 01:03:25,815
- Oh, please.
- I saw him outside school earlier.

815
01:03:25,886 --> 01:03:27,911
Probably just some pervert
cruising school poontang.

816
01:03:27,989 --> 01:03:30,048
Yeah, wait. Watch this.

817
01:03:30,124 --> 01:03:31,648
Hey, freak!

818
01:03:31,726 --> 01:03:33,591
Hey, freak, you want
some of the young stuff?

819
01:03:33,661 --> 01:03:35,561
You like that?
Well, come and get it.

820
01:03:35,630 --> 01:03:36,756
- Hey!
- Lynda, stop.

821
01:03:36,831 --> 01:03:39,163
Hey, asshole.
My daddy's the sheriff.

822
01:03:39,233 --> 01:03:41,633
Huh? Why don't you go crawl back
under your fucking rock?

823
01:03:41,702 --> 01:03:44,262
- Yeah, whatever.
- See, I told you.

824
01:03:44,338 --> 01:03:46,272
He's just some
stupid fucking pervert.

825
01:03:46,340 --> 01:03:48,365
- Total pervert.
- Gosh, you guys are crazy.

826
01:03:48,442 --> 01:03:49,704
That guy could have been dangerous.

827
01:03:49,777 --> 01:03:51,005
- Oh, God.
- Whatever.

828
01:03:51,078 --> 01:03:52,875
- What is he going to do?
- I don't know.

829
01:03:52,947 --> 01:03:56,439
Oh, my God.
You should date him!

830
01:03:57,885 --> 01:03:59,819
- You should!
- You guys!

831
01:04:02,189 --> 01:04:04,214
- Oh, no, 5-0.
- Hey.

832
01:04:04,291 --> 01:04:05,849
Hi, Dad.

833
01:04:05,926 --> 01:04:07,450
Hey, Mr. Brackett.

834
01:04:07,528 --> 01:04:10,429
- Nice furry hat, Mr. Brackett.
- Thank you.

835
01:04:10,498 --> 01:04:11,760
What's up, Dad?

836
01:04:11,832 --> 01:04:14,528
I'm on my way home.
Anybody want a ride?

837
01:04:14,602 --> 01:04:16,069
Yeah. Hell, yeah, I'll take a ride.

838
01:04:16,137 --> 01:04:17,297
- No.
- You guys?

839
01:04:17,371 --> 01:04:18,861
Bacon-mobiles make me nauseous.

840
01:04:18,939 --> 01:04:20,497
- Nice.
- Bye, Annie.

841
01:04:20,574 --> 01:04:22,041
- See you later.
- Bye, guys.

842
01:04:22,109 --> 01:04:23,974
Hey, kiddo.

843
01:04:26,881 --> 01:04:30,282
- Kind of a drag having a pig as a dad.
- Nah, I like him.

844
01:04:30,351 --> 01:04:32,819
Yeah? Do you think
he was flirting with me?

845
01:04:32,887 --> 01:04:34,718
- You are so demented.
- Totally.

846
01:04:34,789 --> 01:04:37,087
- Yeah. See ya.
- Bye.

847
01:05:13,094 --> 01:05:15,927
- I hate you!

848
01:05:21,068 --> 01:05:23,195
Aw, how cute.

849
01:05:23,270 --> 01:05:25,431
Would you please help me
with this stupid thing?

850
01:05:25,506 --> 01:05:27,337
Okay, okay, okay.

851
01:05:27,408 --> 01:05:30,502
Jeez. Mom, why do you
deal with this every year?

852
01:05:30,578 --> 01:05:32,637
Because for some unbelievable reason,

853
01:05:32,713 --> 01:05:35,477
your father likes it.

854
01:05:35,549 --> 01:05:37,574
- The feet look like the hands--
- It's not working.

855
01:05:37,651 --> 01:05:40,848
And the hands like the feet,
and I can't get the thing in the hole, and--

856
01:05:40,921 --> 01:05:43,947
- Oh, I can't get it!
- Calm down, I'm helping--

857
01:05:44,024 --> 01:05:45,389
Oh, I got it.

858
01:05:46,961 --> 01:05:48,428
- You got it?
- Will you try and get those right?

859
01:05:48,496 --> 01:05:49,963
Okay, I'll try.

860
01:05:50,030 --> 01:05:51,190
Oh, jeez.

861
01:05:51,265 --> 01:05:54,428
I've been out here
for two hours doing this.

862
01:05:54,502 --> 01:05:56,470
There.

863
01:05:56,604 --> 01:05:59,004
- Hey, do you want me to get--
- Just hang himself. No!

864
01:05:59,073 --> 01:06:01,803
I'm still upset about the whole
bagel thing this morning,

865
01:06:01,876 --> 01:06:02,865
if you want to know the truth.

866
01:06:02,943 --> 01:06:04,103
Mom, that was a joke.

867
01:06:04,178 --> 01:06:05,543
- Oh, yeah. Well, let me tell you.
- It was a joke.

868
01:06:05,613 --> 01:06:07,478
There are some things
moms don't need to hear.

869
01:06:07,548 --> 01:06:09,140
- Yeah, I'm 17.
- I know you're 17.

870
01:06:09,216 --> 01:06:12,014
You're the best, Mom.

871
01:06:17,491 --> 01:06:19,322
Yeah, it's right over here.

872
01:06:20,728 --> 01:06:22,628
Yeah. Hello?

873
01:06:22,696 --> 01:06:25,096
Yes, uh, Sheriff Brackett, please.

874
01:06:25,166 --> 01:06:29,034
Dr. Samuel Loomis.
Yeah. Hello? He--

875
01:06:29,103 --> 01:06:33,665
Oh, sh-- ugh!
Can I borrow your cell phone?

876
01:06:33,741 --> 01:06:36,301
This thing's about as useful
as a row of Christmas puddings.

877
01:06:36,377 --> 01:06:38,368
Oh, no. I don't have one.

878
01:06:38,445 --> 01:06:40,003
Causes brain cancer.

879
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:41,809
Oh, yeah. Right.

880
01:06:41,949 --> 01:06:45,316
You know, I remember this mess
just like it happened yesterday?

881
01:06:45,386 --> 01:06:46,751
It was tragic.

882
01:06:46,821 --> 01:06:48,618
The poor woman,
I guess she couldn't stand the stress

883
01:06:48,689 --> 01:06:51,624
of being labeled "Satan's mother."

884
01:06:51,692 --> 01:06:54,126
I think she blew her fucking head off.

885
01:06:54,195 --> 01:06:56,026
I'm still amazed.

886
01:06:56,096 --> 01:06:59,588
A young boy like that
butchering all those people.

887
01:06:59,667 --> 01:07:03,535
And the doctor involved--
I think he wrote a book or something.

888
01:07:03,604 --> 01:07:05,094
Fucking blood money.

889
01:07:05,172 --> 01:07:06,935
Yeah, I read that book.
It was a masterpiece.

890
01:07:07,007 --> 01:07:09,669
- Now, are we close?
- Yes, it's just here. I gu--

891
01:07:11,178 --> 01:07:13,339
- Goddamn son of a bitch!
- What?

892
01:07:13,414 --> 01:07:16,212
Those fucking kids!
Jesus Christ!

893
01:07:16,283 --> 01:07:19,878
Don't they think I have anything better to do
with my time than clean up this shit?

894
01:07:19,954 --> 01:07:21,945
Fucking little idiots! God damn it!

895
01:07:22,022 --> 01:07:23,683
Where the hell are you going?

896
01:07:25,926 --> 01:07:29,487
Who would do sick shit like this?

897
01:07:29,563 --> 01:07:32,396
I think I know whose grave that is.

898
01:08:03,364 --> 01:08:06,891
Dude, it fucking totally sucks
that they're selling this place.

899
01:08:06,967 --> 01:08:09,492
It's reduced.
Maybe I can buy it.

900
01:08:09,570 --> 01:08:12,437
Yeah, with like, your $10 you have
in your piggy bank?

901
01:08:14,208 --> 01:08:16,199
It's a shithole anyway.

902
01:08:16,277 --> 01:08:17,767
I'm going to miss it.

903
01:08:17,845 --> 01:08:18,903
Don't worry, dude.

904
01:08:18,979 --> 01:08:21,345
We'll find another house to party in.

905
01:08:21,415 --> 01:08:24,384
Besides, I'm gonna
get the van all jacked up.

906
01:08:24,451 --> 01:08:27,215
You're gonna want to spend
more time in there anyway.

907
01:08:44,705 --> 01:08:46,104
Wait, wait!

908
01:08:46,173 --> 01:08:48,334
Wait, just like that.

909
01:08:48,409 --> 01:08:50,843
Oh, God.

910
01:08:50,911 --> 01:08:52,003
Oh, wait. Wait.

911
01:08:52,079 --> 01:08:53,171
Right there, right there.

912
01:08:53,247 --> 01:08:56,045
- Hold on!
- Wait, my calf is cramping, man.

913
01:08:56,116 --> 01:08:57,845
Why'd you stop?
Oh, God--

914
01:08:57,918 --> 01:08:59,783
Oh, fuck.

915
01:09:04,591 --> 01:09:06,650
A fucking little warning would be nice.

916
01:09:06,727 --> 01:09:09,389
- Fuck.
- I'm sorry.

917
01:09:09,463 --> 01:09:11,431
Jesus.

918
01:09:15,202 --> 01:09:17,568
- Get me another beer.
- You get it.

919
01:09:17,638 --> 01:09:20,198
I'm the one that just did all the heavy lifting.

920
01:09:22,009 --> 01:09:23,476
All right, I'll go.

921
01:09:27,748 --> 01:09:32,378
So, seriously, on a scale from 1 to 10,
should I have a 5?

922
01:09:32,453 --> 01:09:36,856
How about... zero?

923
01:09:36,924 --> 01:09:38,084
- More like--
- Zero.

924
01:09:38,158 --> 01:09:39,386
More like zero plus 11.

925
01:10:18,832 --> 01:10:21,027
- Hello?
- Yo, Mama.

926
01:10:21,101 --> 01:10:22,864
What up, dude?

927
01:10:22,936 --> 01:10:25,734
<i>- Nothing much.
- Oh, what's wrong?</i>

928
01:10:25,806 --> 01:10:28,331
I was just thinking about
what Annie said earlier today,

929
01:10:28,409 --> 01:10:30,741
concerning my so-called
"cheerleading incident."

930
01:10:30,811 --> 01:10:32,642
I don't know.
It's kind of bumming me out.

931
01:10:35,115 --> 01:10:38,050
Fuck, dude, who put
all the empties back in here?

932
01:10:39,386 --> 01:10:40,717
You don't think that, do you?

933
01:10:40,788 --> 01:10:42,050
Lynda, I don't think you're a slut.

934
01:10:42,122 --> 01:10:43,555
Come on, that's ridiculous.

935
01:10:43,624 --> 01:10:46,252
I don't give a shit what Annie thinks anyway.

936
01:10:46,326 --> 01:10:47,452
But I care what you think.

937
01:10:47,961 --> 01:10:49,588
Aww!

938
01:11:05,179 --> 01:11:06,168
Fuck!

939
01:11:07,714 --> 01:11:09,181
What-- What the f--

940
01:11:51,959 --> 01:11:55,451
Jesus, Bob, could you move
your pokey ass a little slower?

941
01:11:55,529 --> 01:11:56,860
Well, could you?

942
01:12:01,768 --> 01:12:03,167
Well, that's cute.

943
01:12:04,571 --> 01:12:07,404
See anything you like?

944
01:12:15,749 --> 01:12:17,410
Okay, enough.

945
01:12:17,484 --> 01:12:18,917
Joke's over.

946
01:12:18,986 --> 01:12:20,613
Beer, please.

947
01:12:25,425 --> 01:12:28,758
Hey, Casper the Friendly Asshole Ghost,
hand me my beer.

948
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:33,358
Well, fucking hand it over, dip-shit.

949
01:12:36,336 --> 01:12:39,169
Why do you have to become
such a fucking jerk every time we do it?

950
01:12:39,239 --> 01:12:42,003
You think you'd be grateful
that I let you touch me with that thing.

951
01:12:42,075 --> 01:12:43,440
And anyway, you're not a zero.

952
01:12:43,510 --> 01:12:45,978
You're a fucking minus 5 or something.

953
01:12:46,046 --> 01:12:47,308
Whatever.

954
01:12:47,381 --> 01:12:48,939
What'd you do to this beer?

955
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:33,791
What about this big one here?
That looks perfect.

956
01:13:33,860 --> 01:13:35,384
- You mean, like, this one here?
- Yeah, that one.

957
01:13:35,462 --> 01:13:38,363
- Yes, yes, that's lovely.
- .22 Smith & Wesson.

958
01:13:38,432 --> 01:13:40,263
- That's good.
- Yeah.

959
01:13:40,334 --> 01:13:42,427
That's okay if you want to just piss it off.

960
01:13:42,502 --> 01:13:46,233
If you want to blow its fucking head off...

961
01:13:46,306 --> 01:13:47,603
this is what you want.

962
01:13:47,674 --> 01:13:49,539
.357 Magnum.

963
01:13:49,610 --> 01:13:51,976
Wolff mainspring, polygonal rifling.

964
01:13:52,045 --> 01:13:53,512
Beautiful, beautiful.
Poly what?

965
01:13:53,580 --> 01:13:56,310
- Muzzle velocity of 1,450 feet per second.
- Great, just wrap it up.

966
01:13:56,383 --> 01:13:57,714
- That's fine.
- Okay, okay.

967
01:13:57,784 --> 01:13:59,376
- Take it easy.
- Thank you. Yes.

968
01:13:59,453 --> 01:14:00,545
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

969
01:14:00,621 --> 01:14:02,111
If you could just wrap it up,
that'd be great.

970
01:14:02,189 --> 01:14:03,679
- Thank you.
- What are we hunting?

971
01:14:03,757 --> 01:14:07,818
- Girls, you look so beautiful.
- Little princesses.

972
01:14:07,894 --> 01:14:08,883
- Trick or treat.
- Here you go.

973
01:14:08,962 --> 01:14:09,986
- Thank you.
- Here's some candy.

974
01:14:10,063 --> 01:14:12,361
- Oh, Happy Halloween.
- You, too.

975
01:14:12,432 --> 01:14:15,094
- Bye, you guys.
- Thank you. Bye.

976
01:14:16,670 --> 01:14:18,467
So cute.

977
01:14:18,538 --> 01:14:21,132
I cannot believe you're graduating this year.

978
01:14:21,208 --> 01:14:23,938
I remember when you used
to run around looking like that.

979
01:14:24,011 --> 01:14:25,945
Mom, I was never a princess.

980
01:14:26,013 --> 01:14:28,277
Last thing I was at their age
was dead Little Red Riding Hood.

981
01:14:28,348 --> 01:14:29,645
You were this beautiful ballerina--

982
01:14:29,716 --> 01:14:32,480
No, you bought me the blood
and you gave me the cuts.

983
01:14:32,552 --> 01:14:33,917
"My costume's too tight."

984
01:14:33,987 --> 01:14:35,579
- You don't remember that?
- I never wore a tutu.

985
01:14:35,656 --> 01:14:37,385
You getting many kids?

986
01:14:37,457 --> 01:14:40,324
Only two so far.

987
01:14:40,394 --> 01:14:42,828
Listen...

988
01:14:42,896 --> 01:14:43,885
be careful tonight.

989
01:14:43,964 --> 01:14:44,953
I know.

990
01:14:45,032 --> 01:14:47,432
A lot of nut cases come out on Halloween.

991
01:14:47,501 --> 01:14:50,698
It's, uh--
What was it you told me to say?

992
01:14:52,172 --> 01:14:54,834
- Amateur night.
- Yeah, that's right. Amateur night.

993
01:14:54,908 --> 01:14:57,035
Dad, I'm just going to be babysitting.

994
01:14:57,110 --> 01:14:58,702
- What's the worst thing I could do?
- All right, okay.

995
01:14:58,779 --> 01:15:00,474
- I'm just saying.
- Nice.

996
01:15:00,547 --> 01:15:01,571
- All right.
- Sorry.

997
01:15:01,648 --> 01:15:03,206
- Aah!
- Mom, st--

998
01:15:07,487 --> 01:15:09,216
Hi, Mr. And Mrs. Strode!

999
01:15:09,289 --> 01:15:10,415
- Hey, Annie.
- Hey.

1000
01:15:10,490 --> 01:15:11,548
How's your dad?

1001
01:15:11,625 --> 01:15:14,219
Oh, you know, same as always.

1002
01:15:14,294 --> 01:15:16,489
- You know what that means?
- Mm-hmm.

1003
01:15:18,165 --> 01:15:19,632
Yeah. Love you guys!

1004
01:15:19,700 --> 01:15:22,032
- Love you, too!
- Bye-bye!

1005
01:15:22,102 --> 01:15:23,364
Gonna give me some lovin'?

1006
01:15:23,437 --> 01:15:27,737
I'll give you some lovin' later, but first
you're going to talk about the vacation.

1007
01:15:27,808 --> 01:15:31,175
I'm going to go build a fire.

1008
01:15:31,244 --> 01:15:32,939
Vacation.

1009
01:15:33,013 --> 01:15:35,481
I hate vacation. Let's stay home.

1010
01:16:07,848 --> 01:16:09,145
Aaahhh!

1011
01:16:36,109 --> 01:16:38,100
No! No!

1012
01:16:38,178 --> 01:16:41,443
You leave my baby alone, you--

1013
01:17:01,535 --> 01:17:04,003
Okay, Tommy,
here's your jelly sandwich,

1014
01:17:04,070 --> 01:17:06,095
hold the peanut butter.

1015
01:17:06,173 --> 01:17:07,401
Good.

1016
01:17:07,474 --> 01:17:09,374
You know, if you listened to me
the first time,

1017
01:17:09,443 --> 01:17:10,933
you wouldn't had to have made it twice.

1018
01:17:14,181 --> 01:17:16,649
- Laurie?
- What?

1019
01:17:17,417 --> 01:17:19,351
Is the Boogey Man real?

1020
01:17:19,419 --> 01:17:21,717
Why are you so obsessed
with the Boogey Man, Tommy?

1021
01:17:21,788 --> 01:17:25,087
- Well, I hear things at school.
- Like what?

1022
01:17:25,158 --> 01:17:27,888
Well, I heard that on Halloween night,

1023
01:17:27,961 --> 01:17:31,419
the Boogey Man sneaks out
and attacks kids who don't believe.

1024
01:17:33,266 --> 01:17:35,291
You know what, Tommy?

1025
01:17:35,368 --> 01:17:37,336
It is true.

1026
01:17:37,404 --> 01:17:40,066
He likes to eat little boys like you.

1027
01:17:42,142 --> 01:17:43,734
Oh, my God!
The Boogey Man's here!

1028
01:17:43,810 --> 01:17:45,505
We're going to die!

1029
01:17:46,980 --> 01:17:48,538
Hold that thought.

1030
01:17:48,615 --> 01:17:50,810
That's not appropriate
babysitter behavior, Laurie.

1031
01:17:50,884 --> 01:17:52,112
Hello?

1032
01:17:52,819 --> 01:17:54,252
<i>Shut up.</i>

1033
01:17:54,321 --> 01:17:57,154
<i>- My parents will hear about this one.
- Yo, it's me. Hey.</i>

1034
01:17:57,224 --> 01:17:59,522
So the Wallaces are finally out of my face.

1035
01:17:59,593 --> 01:18:01,185
I just talked to Paul.
He's on his way over.

1036
01:18:01,261 --> 01:18:06,756
So I'm finishing making the Queen of Sheba
her popcorn, and then I will be over.

1037
01:18:06,833 --> 01:18:09,961
I have some fun and exciting news for you,
so I'll see you in a few minutes.

1038
01:18:10,036 --> 01:18:11,469
Okay, bye.

1039
01:18:13,206 --> 01:18:15,538
- Guess what, Tommy.
- What?

1040
01:18:15,609 --> 01:18:18,100
Lindsey Wallace is coming over.

1041
01:18:18,178 --> 01:18:20,203
What? She can't come over here!

1042
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:23,078
- What if the guys see her?
- So?

1043
01:18:23,149 --> 01:18:24,616
One, she's a girl.

1044
01:18:24,684 --> 01:18:26,811
Two, she's not a boy.

1045
01:18:26,887 --> 01:18:28,548
And three, she smells like you.

1046
01:18:28,622 --> 01:18:32,023
This is going to be a long night.

1047
01:18:32,092 --> 01:18:33,423
For the both of us.

1048
01:18:34,427 --> 01:18:35,416
- Don't start with me.
- Uh, uh.

1049
01:18:35,495 --> 01:18:37,520
What's the matter with you?

1050
01:19:04,157 --> 01:19:06,955
Lindsey... get your coat on.

1051
01:19:07,027 --> 01:19:08,961
We're going to go over
and see Tommy Doyal.

1052
01:19:09,029 --> 01:19:10,792
Okay.

1053
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:21,206
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

1054
01:19:21,274 --> 01:19:23,606
Yeah, exactly.
I said get your coat on.

1055
01:19:23,677 --> 01:19:27,738
We're going over to your late-night lover
Tommy Doyal's house.

1056
01:19:27,814 --> 01:19:28,940
No, you didn't.

1057
01:19:29,015 --> 01:19:30,277
Yes, I did.

1058
01:19:30,350 --> 01:19:32,341
No, you didn't.

1059
01:19:32,419 --> 01:19:36,856
Don, I'm sorry if I don't
sound too concerned,

1060
01:19:36,923 --> 01:19:41,019
but a dead coyote and a missing headstone
doesn't prove anything.

1061
01:19:41,094 --> 01:19:42,118
Well, I think you're wrong, Sheriff.

1062
01:19:42,195 --> 01:19:44,891
I think it does prove
that he's here in Haddonfield.

1063
01:19:44,965 --> 01:19:47,525
It was a Halloween prank.

1064
01:19:47,601 --> 01:19:49,899
Kids pull shit like that all the time.

1065
01:19:49,970 --> 01:19:51,494
The stone will be returned tomorrow.

1066
01:19:51,571 --> 01:19:53,630
And besides, it weighs over half a ton.

1067
01:19:53,707 --> 01:19:56,175
That's my point exactly.

1068
01:19:56,242 --> 01:20:00,178
So you're saying that one man picked it up
and walked away with it?

1069
01:20:00,246 --> 01:20:01,372
Yes.

1070
01:20:01,448 --> 01:20:04,144
Doc, I may have been born,
but I wasn't born yesterday.

1071
01:20:04,217 --> 01:20:07,482
I'm sorry, Sheriff,
but please listen to me.

1072
01:20:07,554 --> 01:20:09,784
This may be a matter of life and death.

1073
01:20:09,856 --> 01:20:12,984
All right, I'll tell you what I'll do.

1074
01:20:13,059 --> 01:20:14,856
You come by my office tomorrow--

1075
01:20:14,928 --> 01:20:17,362
Tomorrow is too late.

1076
01:20:17,430 --> 01:20:19,694
Evil is here.

1077
01:20:19,766 --> 01:20:21,597
It's walking amongst us.

1078
01:20:21,668 --> 01:20:24,660
Doc, it sounds to me like
you're talking about the Antichrist.

1079
01:20:24,738 --> 01:20:27,298
Well, perhaps I am.

1080
01:20:27,374 --> 01:20:28,363
Smell my feet

1081
01:20:28,441 --> 01:20:30,102
Give me something good to eat

1082
01:20:30,176 --> 01:20:31,973
If you don't, I don't care

1083
01:20:32,045 --> 01:20:33,979
I'll pull down Annie's underwear

1084
01:20:34,047 --> 01:20:37,175
I can't believe you're making me
haul this thing all the way over there.

1085
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:40,686
I can't believe you think
I'm not going to tell.

1086
01:20:41,788 --> 01:20:44,621
Gonna share some popcorn
with your little boyfriend?

1087
01:20:44,691 --> 01:20:46,556
No, I'm not.

1088
01:20:46,626 --> 01:20:48,150
You know you are.

1089
01:20:48,228 --> 01:20:50,890
You know you're going
to share something with Paul.

1090
01:20:50,964 --> 01:20:53,159
You know how annoying you are?

1091
01:20:53,233 --> 01:20:55,098
How?

1092
01:20:55,168 --> 01:20:57,227
Trick or treat, smell my feet.

1093
01:20:57,303 --> 01:20:59,032
Give me something good to eat

1094
01:20:59,105 --> 01:21:02,097
- If you don't, I don't care--
- I swear to God, Lindsey.

1095
01:21:02,175 --> 01:21:03,665
If you don't stop singing that song,

1096
01:21:03,743 --> 01:21:05,574
we're going to have
a pumpkin-smashing party

1097
01:21:05,645 --> 01:21:07,374
right here in the middle of the street.

1098
01:21:16,222 --> 01:21:18,452
Tommy, where's your girlfriend Laurie?

1099
01:21:18,525 --> 01:21:20,891
Laurie's not my girlfriend.
I hate girls.

1100
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:23,155
Why doesn't anyone understand this?

1101
01:21:23,229 --> 01:21:24,821
Good. So does Lindsey.

1102
01:21:24,898 --> 01:21:26,593
Go worship your god.

1103
01:21:26,666 --> 01:21:29,066
- Hey.
- Brought you a present.

1104
01:21:29,135 --> 01:21:30,762
Thanks.

1105
01:21:30,837 --> 01:21:33,931
You, my dear, will be happy to know

1106
01:21:34,007 --> 01:21:36,976
that I talked to Paul
about his buddy Ben Tramer.

1107
01:21:37,043 --> 01:21:39,534
Oh, I thought you said
Ben Tramer was retarded.

1108
01:21:39,612 --> 01:21:43,742
<i>Yeah, but he's not
Shortbus retarded or anything.</i>

1109
01:21:43,817 --> 01:21:44,875
What? He's okay.

1110
01:21:44,951 --> 01:21:48,580
- I mean, you need a boyfriend!
- Annie, I don't need a boyfriend.

1111
01:21:48,655 --> 01:21:49,986
- No, that's not what I meant.
- I'm fine.

1112
01:21:50,056 --> 01:21:51,648
- You need--
- Okay, Annie--

1113
01:21:51,725 --> 01:21:53,556
Oh! Oh! Yes!

1114
01:21:53,626 --> 01:21:54,650
Yes, Annie!

1115
01:21:54,728 --> 01:21:56,923
Okay, ok--

1116
01:21:56,996 --> 01:21:58,258
All right, you're right.

1117
01:21:58,331 --> 01:21:59,593
I need a boyfriend.

1118
01:21:59,666 --> 01:22:01,429
So, what did he say?

1119
01:22:01,501 --> 01:22:04,436
He said, and I quote,

1120
01:22:04,504 --> 01:22:07,962
"Dude, she's fucking hot."

1121
01:22:08,041 --> 01:22:09,941
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

1122
01:22:14,681 --> 01:22:16,842
Oh, fuck, that's Paul.
I gotta go.

1123
01:22:16,916 --> 01:22:18,747
- Have fun.
- Thanks, I will.

1124
01:22:18,818 --> 01:22:20,479
- Bye, sexy.
- Bye.

1125
01:22:26,226 --> 01:22:27,488
Hi, baby.

1126
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:29,118
- What's up?
- How are you?

1127
01:22:29,195 --> 01:22:30,287
I'm good.
How are you?

1128
01:22:30,363 --> 01:22:31,523
Good.

1129
01:22:32,265 --> 01:22:36,224
You have to stop thinking
that we're dealing with a normal man here.

1130
01:22:36,302 --> 01:22:39,567
We're dealing with
a soulless killing machine,

1131
01:22:39,639 --> 01:22:42,267
driven by pure animal instinct.

1132
01:22:43,510 --> 01:22:47,412
Dr. Loomis, I'm going
to have to level with you.

1133
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:49,345
I read your book.

1134
01:22:49,415 --> 01:22:52,213
I know exactly who you are,
and frankly, I don't like you.

1135
01:22:52,285 --> 01:22:54,116
And I'll tell you something else.

1136
01:22:54,187 --> 01:22:57,850
I think you have created
quite the masterpiece of a monster

1137
01:22:57,924 --> 01:23:03,328
off the blood of this town,
because monsters sell books.

1138
01:23:03,396 --> 01:23:07,799
Please, just look at this photograph
on the cover of the book.

1139
01:23:07,867 --> 01:23:08,959
All right.

1140
01:23:10,937 --> 01:23:14,373
I first met Michael 17 years ago.

1141
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:20,003
When I first met him,
he was a sweet, charming little boy.

1142
01:23:20,079 --> 01:23:23,776
But he had nothing inside.

1143
01:23:23,850 --> 01:23:26,478
There was something missing, a void.

1144
01:23:26,553 --> 01:23:30,114
There was no conscience, no reason,

1145
01:23:30,190 --> 01:23:35,787
even a rudimentary sense
of life or death, right or wrong.

1146
01:23:35,862 --> 01:23:39,628
Yeah. He's come back for her.

1147
01:23:39,699 --> 01:23:44,068
And who is her?

1148
01:23:44,137 --> 01:23:47,698
He's come back for his baby sister.

1149
01:23:47,774 --> 01:23:50,572
I know it in my bones, Sheriff.

1150
01:23:52,145 --> 01:23:53,476
To do what?

1151
01:23:57,050 --> 01:23:59,280
I don't know, Sheriff, but...

1152
01:24:00,653 --> 01:24:02,883
it's not good.

1153
01:24:06,926 --> 01:24:10,828
If I break a promise I made a long time ago,

1154
01:24:10,897 --> 01:24:14,333
then you must promise that you will play it

1155
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:18,063
razor, and I mean razor, straight with me.

1156
01:24:21,441 --> 01:24:24,069
<i>Hello. You have reached
the Strode residence.</i>

1157
01:24:24,143 --> 01:24:26,907
<i>We can't come to the phone right now.</i>

1158
01:24:26,980 --> 01:24:31,007
<i>So please leave a message and have a...</i>

1159
01:24:31,084 --> 01:24:34,884
<i>Happy Halloweenl</i>

1160
01:24:37,123 --> 01:24:39,853
Yeah, this is Sheriff Brackett. Hello?

1161
01:24:39,926 --> 01:24:41,393
If you can hear me, pick up.

1162
01:24:41,461 --> 01:24:46,228
<i>Please, if you can hear me,
I need to talk to you immediately.</i>

1163
01:24:52,405 --> 01:24:53,394
Let's go.

1164
01:24:53,473 --> 01:24:56,408
- Laurie?
- What, Tommy?

1165
01:24:56,476 --> 01:25:00,936
I would like to return to the subject
we started earlier this evening.

1166
01:25:01,014 --> 01:25:02,538
What? Your hatred of peanut butter?

1167
01:25:02,615 --> 01:25:04,776
No, the Boogey Man.

1168
01:25:04,851 --> 01:25:07,012
I need some closure on this topic.

1169
01:25:07,086 --> 01:25:08,610
I've heard all about this.

1170
01:25:08,688 --> 01:25:11,088
What do you want to know, Tommy?

1171
01:25:11,157 --> 01:25:13,455
Why would he only attack kids
who don't believe?

1172
01:25:13,526 --> 01:25:15,653
I mean, it doesn't make sense.

1173
01:25:15,728 --> 01:25:18,322
Is it because if you believe,
then you're protected by his powers?

1174
01:25:18,398 --> 01:25:20,332
Okay, Tommy,
enough about the Boogey Man.

1175
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:21,458
It's nonsense.

1176
01:25:21,534 --> 01:25:24,264
I'm with Tommy on this one.

1177
01:25:24,337 --> 01:25:28,330
Yeah. Why do you keep
avoiding the subject, Laurie?

1178
01:25:28,408 --> 01:25:30,205
Is-- Is she scared?

1179
01:25:30,276 --> 01:25:31,504
- Maybe she is.
- Ooh, yeah.

1180
01:25:31,577 --> 01:25:33,738
- Maybe you're scared!
- Are you scared?

1181
01:25:33,813 --> 01:25:35,508
Okay, stop! Stop!

1182
01:25:35,581 --> 01:25:39,108
Leave me alone for five seconds, please.

1183
01:25:39,185 --> 01:25:41,983
- Five, four, three...
- You guys...

1184
01:25:42,055 --> 01:25:44,182
- Okay, please don't.
- Two, one.

1185
01:25:44,257 --> 01:25:45,781
No! No!

1186
01:25:45,858 --> 01:25:47,485
I'm going to tell your parents!

1187
01:25:51,197 --> 01:25:54,189
Hey, don't pull it like that.
You're going to stretch it all out.

1188
01:25:54,267 --> 01:25:58,260
- Come on, munchie.
- Stop. This is expensive, idiot.

1189
01:26:07,714 --> 01:26:09,579
- You want to fuck me?
- Yeah.

1190
01:26:09,649 --> 01:26:11,378
- Yeah?
- You're so fucking hot, babe.

1191
01:26:11,451 --> 01:26:14,318
You want to fuck me?
I want to hear you say it.

1192
01:26:14,387 --> 01:26:15,877
- I'm gonna fuck you.
- Yeah?

1193
01:26:15,955 --> 01:26:17,354
Say it again.

1194
01:26:21,894 --> 01:26:24,089
It's so fucking warm.

1195
01:26:50,590 --> 01:26:52,182
Oh, my--

1196
01:26:52,258 --> 01:26:53,350
What's the matter?

1197
01:28:14,907 --> 01:28:16,670
Lindsey, it's time for you to go home.

1198
01:28:16,742 --> 01:28:18,300
But the movie's not over.

1199
01:28:18,377 --> 01:28:20,004
You can finish watching the movie
at your house.

1200
01:28:20,079 --> 01:28:23,071
- How about during the commercial break?
- Negative.

1201
01:28:23,149 --> 01:28:24,446
Go get your jacket!

1202
01:28:24,517 --> 01:28:27,782
You heard her, girl.
Keep on marching.

1203
01:28:27,854 --> 01:28:30,152
Ugh! I am Queen Sheba, okay?

1204
01:28:30,223 --> 01:28:34,125
- Bow down and worship me.
- Go get your jacket.

1205
01:28:36,129 --> 01:28:37,858
Are you sure you're okay
while I take Lindsey home?

1206
01:28:37,930 --> 01:28:40,421
- I'm fine.
- Are you sure, little Tommy?

1207
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:43,992
- You'll be by yourself!
- I'm fine, now stop asking!

1208
01:28:44,070 --> 01:28:45,059
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

1209
01:28:45,138 --> 01:28:47,436
- He's scared.
- No, I'm not.

1210
01:28:47,507 --> 01:28:48,872
- Yes, you are.
- Shut up.

1211
01:28:48,941 --> 01:28:51,739
Okay, you guys. Stop.

1212
01:28:51,811 --> 01:28:54,712
Behave, Tommy-Wommy.

1213
01:28:57,116 --> 01:29:01,280
About 17 years ago,
I respond to a 911

1214
01:29:01,354 --> 01:29:04,346
which turned out to be
the Myers woman's suicide.

1215
01:29:04,423 --> 01:29:09,520
And I see this beautiful,
innocent baby sitting in this bloody mess,

1216
01:29:09,595 --> 01:29:12,758
and I can't imagine this child growing up
with a stigma around her neck,

1217
01:29:13,332 --> 01:29:19,134
so I omit her from the report,
I drive her to another town,

1218
01:29:19,205 --> 01:29:21,469
and drop her off
at the nearest emergency room.

1219
01:29:21,541 --> 01:29:23,372
And I think that this
is going to be the end of it.

1220
01:29:23,442 --> 01:29:26,309
About three months later,
I find out from a friend of mine,

1221
01:29:26,379 --> 01:29:29,439
Mason Strode,
that he's adopted the baby.

1222
01:29:29,515 --> 01:29:30,777
Oh, my God.

1223
01:29:39,258 --> 01:29:40,987
- Cold?
- Yeah.

1224
01:29:41,060 --> 01:29:42,550
Okay, come here.

1225
01:29:44,730 --> 01:29:46,857
- Did you have fun?
- Yeah.

1226
01:29:46,933 --> 01:29:48,764
You sure?

1227
01:29:48,834 --> 01:29:50,062
Yeah.

1228
01:29:52,805 --> 01:29:54,966
Annie? We're coming in.

1229
01:29:55,041 --> 01:29:56,770
You better be decent.

1230
01:29:59,345 --> 01:30:01,279
- Where are the lights?
- Here.

1231
01:30:04,350 --> 01:30:05,339
Annie!

1232
01:30:07,553 --> 01:30:08,781
Oh, my God!

1233
01:30:09,188 --> 01:30:10,280
Lindsey, run home!

1234
01:30:10,356 --> 01:30:12,256
Go call the police! Go!

1235
01:30:12,325 --> 01:30:15,590
Help! Help! Help!

1236
01:30:15,661 --> 01:30:18,562
Oh, my God, honey!
Are you okay?

1237
01:30:18,631 --> 01:30:21,293
Oh, baby, what happened?

1238
01:30:22,969 --> 01:30:24,596
- He's in--
- I'm going to call the police.

1239
01:30:24,670 --> 01:30:26,467
Okay? I promise.

1240
01:30:41,287 --> 01:30:42,584
Shit!

1241
01:30:46,092 --> 01:30:49,653
<i>- 911.
- I need an ambulance, please!</i>

1242
01:30:49,729 --> 01:30:52,197
My friend's bleeding to death.

1243
01:31:18,124 --> 01:31:19,648
Laurie!

1244
01:31:19,725 --> 01:31:22,421
Laurie!

1245
01:31:22,495 --> 01:31:24,326
Laurie!

1246
01:31:24,397 --> 01:31:29,061
My name is Laurie Strode,
and I'm at 1987 Winchester Drive.

1247
01:31:29,135 --> 01:31:32,161
<i>We have a 911 call,
1987 Winchester Drive.</i>

1248
01:31:34,974 --> 01:31:36,032
This is Brackett.

1249
01:31:36,108 --> 01:31:38,770
What's the nature of the emergency
and who called it in?

1250
01:31:38,844 --> 01:31:41,870
<i>Two-stabbing-victim call
placed by a Laurie Strode.</i>

1251
01:31:41,947 --> 01:31:44,575
He's found her!
He's found her, for God's sake!

1252
01:31:44,650 --> 01:31:47,551
- How long's it going to take to get there?
- It's about ten minutes.

1253
01:31:48,921 --> 01:31:50,855
Laurie!

1254
01:31:50,923 --> 01:31:52,356
Please, you've got to help her.

1255
01:31:52,425 --> 01:31:54,450
Laurie!

1256
01:31:54,527 --> 01:31:58,224
Baby! Baby, hold on, okay?
Annie, they're com--

1257
01:32:23,656 --> 01:32:26,284
Help!

1258
01:32:26,359 --> 01:32:28,122
Help! Please!

1259
01:32:32,365 --> 01:32:34,799
Help!

1260
01:32:34,867 --> 01:32:36,960
Help! Please!

1261
01:32:37,036 --> 01:32:39,834
Help, please! Someone!

1262
01:32:46,078 --> 01:32:48,308
Tommy!

1263
01:32:49,382 --> 01:32:51,907
Tommy, open the door!

1264
01:32:51,984 --> 01:32:55,943
Open the door!
Tommy, open the door!

1265
01:32:56,122 --> 01:32:59,455
Tommy!
Open the door!

1266
01:32:59,525 --> 01:33:04,292
Open the door! Tommy!
Open the door!

1267
01:33:04,363 --> 01:33:05,921
What's going on?

1268
01:33:05,998 --> 01:33:07,090
What's happening?

1269
01:33:07,166 --> 01:33:08,326
Where's Lindsey, Tommy?

1270
01:33:08,401 --> 01:33:09,459
- Where's Lindsey?
- She's right there!

1271
01:33:09,535 --> 01:33:11,560
- She's upstairs!
- I'm right here.

1272
01:33:16,041 --> 01:33:17,941
Go upstairs!

1273
01:33:18,010 --> 01:33:20,308
Tommy, go upstairs!

1274
01:33:28,087 --> 01:33:30,317
Guys, get in the bathroom!

1275
01:33:31,557 --> 01:33:33,422
- He's coming!
- Stop! Shh!

1276
01:33:33,492 --> 01:33:35,892
Tommy, be quiet, please?

1277
01:33:49,241 --> 01:33:51,038
I got this.
You check upstairs.

1278
01:33:51,110 --> 01:33:52,475
Right.

1279
01:34:10,095 --> 01:34:12,461
This is the police.
Are you all right?

1280
01:34:12,531 --> 01:34:15,466
He's out there! Please help us!

1281
01:34:15,534 --> 01:34:16,660
The door's locked.

1282
01:34:16,735 --> 01:34:18,362
Are you able to unlock the door?

1283
01:34:26,445 --> 01:34:28,037
Are you able to open the door?

1284
01:34:29,248 --> 01:34:30,545
Yeah.

1285
01:34:32,551 --> 01:34:34,348
Laurie, no.

1286
01:34:34,420 --> 01:34:35,751
Is he gone?

1287
01:34:35,821 --> 01:34:37,413
No, there's no one out here.

1288
01:34:42,862 --> 01:34:44,853
Please, just unlock the door.

1289
01:34:44,930 --> 01:34:46,261
Yeah, hold on.

1290
01:34:46,332 --> 01:34:50,393
- No!
- Open the door.

1291
01:34:56,976 --> 01:34:58,136
Oh, God!

1292
01:35:09,355 --> 01:35:10,447
Freeze!

1293
01:35:14,660 --> 01:35:16,287
Aah!

1294
01:36:24,196 --> 01:36:25,823
Stay behind me.

1295
01:36:40,646 --> 01:36:42,511
Annie?

1296
01:36:42,581 --> 01:36:44,014
Sweetie?

1297
01:36:44,817 --> 01:36:46,614
Annie.

1298
01:36:46,685 --> 01:36:48,710
Annie. Oh, sweetie.

1299
01:36:48,787 --> 01:36:51,688
Stay with me.
Stay with me.

1300
01:36:51,757 --> 01:36:53,816
They'll be here soon.
Come on, darling.

1301
01:36:55,094 --> 01:36:56,083
Jesus.

1302
01:36:56,161 --> 01:36:58,026
Over here!

1303
01:36:59,264 --> 01:37:00,253
Inside here!

1304
01:37:00,332 --> 01:37:02,027
- Boogey Man!
- Help!

1305
01:37:04,870 --> 01:37:05,928
Guys, over here!

1306
01:37:06,005 --> 01:37:07,597
- The Boogey Man!
- What is it?

1307
01:37:07,673 --> 01:37:09,436
Help! The Boogey Man!

1308
01:37:09,508 --> 01:37:10,497
- What? What?
- He's over there!

1309
01:37:10,576 --> 01:37:13,136
He took Laurie.
He took Laurie away.

1310
01:37:13,212 --> 01:37:14,304
Okay, guys.

1311
01:37:14,380 --> 01:37:16,814
Go over and stand by that ambulance
and just wait there.

1312
01:37:16,882 --> 01:37:18,349
Don't move!

1313
01:37:47,646 --> 01:37:49,978
Lynda?

1314
01:37:52,618 --> 01:37:54,415
Lynda?

1315
01:38:01,126 --> 01:38:03,492
Lynda, wake up!

1316
01:38:03,562 --> 01:38:05,792

1323
01:38:38,263 --> 01:38:39,457
What do you want?

1324
01:38:44,503 --> 01:38:47,028
No, no, please.

1325
01:38:47,106 --> 01:38:49,904
Please don't hurt us, please!

1326
01:38:49,975 --> 01:38:52,773
No, please don't hurt me, please!

1327
01:39:23,609 --> 01:39:24,974
I don't understand.

1328
01:39:25,043 --> 01:39:29,377
Please, just let--
Please leave me alone!

1329
01:39:29,448 --> 01:39:32,508

1331
01:40:18,030 --> 01:40:20,794

01:43:38,263 --> 01:43:40,788
Michael, please stop!

1358
01:43:40,866 --> 01:43:43,699

Please.

1365
01:44:11,830 --> 01:44:13,593
Help me, please.

1366
01:44:17,736 --> 01:44:20,170
It's all right. It's all right.

1367
01:44:20,238 --> 01:44:23,799
You're safe now. It's okay.

1368

Ow, my leg.

1369
01:44:26,645 --> 01:44:28,237
It's okay.

1370
01:44:28,313 --> 01:44:29,746
It's all right.

1371
01:45:41,620 --> 01:45:44,987
Was that the Boogey Man?

1372
01:45:47,325 --> 01:45:52,262
As a matter of fact, I do believe it was.

1373

1374
01:46:00,005 --> 01:46:02,235
Michael, don't!

1375

Michael, stop!

1376
01:46:10,549 --> 01:46:13,575
For God's sake, listen to me!

1377
01:46:13,652 --> 01:46:16,883
Look... it's not her fault.

1378
01:46:19,491 --> 01:46:21,049
Michael, it's my fault.

1379
01:46:21,126 --> 01:46:23,492
I failed you.

1380
01:46:23,562 --> 01:46:26,258
Please, let her go. Please.

1381
01:46:55,560 --> 01:46:56,720
