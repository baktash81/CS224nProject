1
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:25,802
Do you have some valid reasons
for wanting a divorce?

2
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,475
Excuse me.

3
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:35,189
My sinuses are very sensitive to irritants.

4
00:02:40,117 --> 00:02:42,822
ln the past five months,

5
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:48,154
l think l've breathed freely,
with both sides working, maybe a week total.

6
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,868
l gotta cut this out. lt's gonna kill me.

7
00:02:58,385 --> 00:03:00,958
l hadn't smoked for 13 years.

8
00:03:03,222 --> 00:03:06,010
l kept the last cigarette from my last pack.

9
00:03:07,435 --> 00:03:10,638
l said if l never smoke this one cigarette

10
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:13,137
l'll never smoke again, period.

11
00:03:14,483 --> 00:03:17,104
13 years l kept that cigarette.

12
00:03:18,821 --> 00:03:20,897
Here.

13
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,452
l had this little case made for it.

14
00:03:26,536 --> 00:03:28,612
See?

15
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:34,034
13 years.

16
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:39,333
And then, one Thursday afternoon,

17
00:03:40,758 --> 00:03:42,834
Barbara came to see me.

18
00:03:44,387 --> 00:03:47,506
And when she left...

19
00:03:51,435 --> 00:03:54,140
You know where l am
if you change your mind.

20
00:04:07,575 --> 00:04:09,900
Barbara and Oliver Rose.

21
00:04:11,829 --> 00:04:16,824
You'd have heard of 'em, except l kept
what happened out ofthe papers.

22
00:04:16,917 --> 00:04:20,915
l think you should hear the story, though.
lt might matter to you.

23
00:04:21,005 --> 00:04:23,792
l won't start the clock yet.

24
00:04:23,882 --> 00:04:26,551
My fee is $450 an hour.

25
00:04:26,635 --> 00:04:31,546
When a man who makes $450 an hour
wants to tell you something for free,

26
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,012
you should listen.

27
00:04:36,895 --> 00:04:39,730
They met... Great.

28
00:04:39,814 --> 00:04:41,807
They agreed on that.

29
00:04:41,899 --> 00:04:46,727
But, the way l saw it,
the poor bastards never had a chance.

30
00:04:49,865 --> 00:04:53,281
lt was the final day of
the season in Nantucket.

31
00:04:55,245 --> 00:04:59,029
A nor'easter was blowing the last
of the tourists offthe island.

32
00:05:59,932 --> 00:06:05,804
The next item up for bid is an exquisite
Japanese carving, circa 1700.

33
00:06:05,896 --> 00:06:10,225
A rare relief of a Shinto goddess,
very richly detailed.

34
00:06:10,317 --> 00:06:13,068
- The intricacies ofthe Orient...
- $10!

35
00:06:13,153 --> 00:06:16,403
l have $10 from the premature young man
in the grey raincoat.

36
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,863
- Do l hear 15?
- 11.

37
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:22,319
$11. Ladies and gentlemen,
please, do l hear 15?

38
00:06:22,411 --> 00:06:27,038
- 20.
- $20. l have $20, ladies and gentlemen.

39
00:06:27,124 --> 00:06:30,410
Do l hear 25 for this
exceptionally exotic item?

40
00:06:30,502 --> 00:06:32,910
- $30.
- 31.

41
00:06:33,005 --> 00:06:38,379
$31. All right, l have $31, ladies and
gentlemen. ls this my final offer?

42
00:06:38,468 --> 00:06:40,591
Ladies and gentlemen, 31, going once...

43
00:06:40,679 --> 00:06:45,056
- $40.
- $40! 40. Do l hear 45?

44
00:06:45,141 --> 00:06:50,052
- 50. Five-0.
- $50. l have $50. Do l hear 60?

45
00:06:50,897 --> 00:06:54,562
$50, going once. Going twice.

46
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:58,066
Sold... to the pretty lady in the white sweater.

47
00:07:00,823 --> 00:07:04,357
- Do you know how much it's worth?
- Doesn't matter. l'm not selling.

48
00:07:04,451 --> 00:07:06,527
$250.

49
00:07:07,663 --> 00:07:09,738
Well, l guess l have a good eye.

50
00:07:09,831 --> 00:07:11,907
l gotta catch the last ferry.

51
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,499
Wait a minute. Let me carry that for you.
Here. Put this on.

52
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:20,750
- l love the rain.
- God, l love it, too.

53
00:07:23,719 --> 00:07:28,132
l know what you're thinking. Harvard Law,
woo, woo, woo! But l got a scholarship.

54
00:07:28,808 --> 00:07:31,678
l'm not rich or anything. l'm brilliant.

55
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,182
- What about you?
- l'm not rich or brilliant.

56
00:07:34,271 --> 00:07:38,185
- Where are you going to school?
- Madison. l got a scholarship. Gymnastics.

57
00:07:38,275 --> 00:07:41,359
l don't know, though.
My body's getting kinda big.

58
00:07:41,445 --> 00:07:43,318
lt looks, uh...

59
00:07:43,405 --> 00:07:46,275
Like a pendulum -
the longer it is, the slower you move.

60
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:50,280
My vaults and tumbling aren't what
they were. My strength moves are good.

61
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,861
Your strength moves?

62
00:08:02,756 --> 00:08:05,247
l love Nantucket.

63
00:08:07,636 --> 00:08:09,712
Oh! l'm gonna miss the ferry.

64
00:08:11,556 --> 00:08:14,593
- Thanks for walking me. Bye.
- Wait! What's your name?

65
00:08:15,393 --> 00:08:17,469
Barbara!

66
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:21,399
Barbara!

67
00:08:21,483 --> 00:08:24,104
Wait a second! l've got a great idea!

68
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:40,615
l'm sorry! l'm sorry!

69
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:45,244
Never, never, never apologise
for being multiorgasmic.

70
00:08:46,381 --> 00:08:49,133
l honestly didn't know l was.

71
00:08:50,385 --> 00:08:52,461
Oh, bless you!

72
00:08:56,224 --> 00:08:58,300
Bless you.

73
00:09:08,277 --> 00:09:10,732
lf we end up together,

74
00:09:10,821 --> 00:09:14,688
then this is the most romantic day
of my whole life.

75
00:09:15,909 --> 00:09:18,234
And ifwe don't,

76
00:09:18,328 --> 00:09:20,404
then l'm a complete slut.

77
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:30,794
This is the story
we're gonna tell our grandchildren.

78
00:09:50,025 --> 00:09:54,153
lt's the return ofthe bald avenger.

79
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:25,055
OK, that's the sixth time.
Now turn it off, honey.

80
00:10:25,141 --> 00:10:27,300
Merry Christmas, Bird.

81
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:40,103
- Honey, give me those papers.
- Say please.

82
00:10:42,158 --> 00:10:44,446
- Please.
- No.

83
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,245
- Where are they?
- l don't got.

84
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,881
- Nice try.
- Thanks.

85
00:11:16,106 --> 00:11:19,689
Hello! Mom's home!

86
00:11:19,777 --> 00:11:23,276
Get over here, you squeezy! Squozy!

87
00:11:23,363 --> 00:11:25,735
Ohh, up we go!

88
00:11:25,824 --> 00:11:27,283
Come on, you.

89
00:11:29,869 --> 00:11:31,412
Hi, honey.

90
00:11:31,496 --> 00:11:34,069
Yeah, now you go in that chair. Got it?

91
00:11:34,165 --> 00:11:37,201
Well, you're gonna go in this one, lady.

92
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,829
- l got you...
- ls that for me?

93
00:11:41,923 --> 00:11:44,330
- There's green for you.
- Oh, thanks.

94
00:11:44,425 --> 00:11:46,750
And it's red for you.

95
00:11:46,844 --> 00:11:50,177
- lt's not a good idea to give them sweets.
- Oh, no. lt is.

96
00:11:50,264 --> 00:11:54,344
l read that kids who are deprived
of sweets and candies all the time,

97
00:11:54,434 --> 00:11:57,352
they get obsessed by it
and they turn out to be obese.

98
00:11:57,437 --> 00:12:00,888
Kids who get it all the time,
it's no big deal - they turn out normal.

99
00:12:00,982 --> 00:12:02,856
And... here.

100
00:12:02,942 --> 00:12:06,774
Being a waitress on Christmas Eve's
very profitable.

101
00:12:08,323 --> 00:12:11,276
- What do you think, guys?
- Ah! Nice!

102
00:12:11,367 --> 00:12:13,443
OK.

103
00:12:15,037 --> 00:12:18,453
l have to put it on the tree! Josh, look!

104
00:12:22,002 --> 00:12:24,078
What do you think?

105
00:12:27,341 --> 00:12:30,959
- Looks like tin foil.
- No, you're right. lt doesn't make it.

106
00:12:31,052 --> 00:12:33,128
l'll learn.

107
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:36,464
- Let's go for a walk.
- l gotta finish this.

108
00:12:36,558 --> 00:12:40,306
- Just a quick stroll. Come on.
- lt's freezing outside. lt's snowing.

109
00:12:40,395 --> 00:12:43,146
Yes. And l'm still asking you to take a walk.

110
00:12:43,231 --> 00:12:45,140
Why? Huh?

111
00:12:45,233 --> 00:12:47,391
- Where are we going?
- Just to the corner.

112
00:12:47,485 --> 00:12:51,897
Barbara, l have work to do.
l can't be walking around here in the snow.

113
00:12:55,117 --> 00:12:58,901
OK, we're at the corner.
So what do you wanna do now? Walk back?

114
00:12:58,996 --> 00:13:02,863
- No, l wanna go for a ride in your car.
- l don't have a car.

115
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:09,545
- You got me a Morgan?
- Yes!

116
00:13:11,341 --> 00:13:15,208
l don't believe it! A Morgan! A Morgan!

117
00:13:15,303 --> 00:13:20,048
- The cook's brother brought it from England.
- lt's got a little rust. l'll restore it.

118
00:13:20,141 --> 00:13:22,845
- How much you pay?
- lt's a present. l used my money.

119
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:25,307
Your money is our money.
Can we afford this?

120
00:13:25,396 --> 00:13:30,022
You are gonna be so successful, this may be
our last opportunity to worry about money.

121
00:13:30,108 --> 00:13:34,355
Come on! Here. Get in.
lt's a right-hand drive.

122
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,194
- Well, are you happy?
- l'm more than happy. l'm way past happy.

123
00:13:39,284 --> 00:13:41,360
l'm married.

124
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,970
Sounds like a fairy tale, doesn't it?

125
00:14:03,056 --> 00:14:05,132
And it was.

126
00:14:07,102 --> 00:14:12,096
My father used to say: ''There are four things
that tell the world who a man is.''

127
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:16,401
''His house, his car, his wife, and his shoes.''

128
00:14:17,403 --> 00:14:21,816
Oliver didn't have the house yet,
but he was definitely moving up in the world.

129
00:14:21,908 --> 00:14:24,363
He'd only been with the firm six months

130
00:14:24,452 --> 00:14:28,745
when he decided to have the senior partners
over to his new apartment for dinner.

131
00:14:28,831 --> 00:14:31,322
He had his eye on the future.

132
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:33,243
So did l.

133
00:14:46,556 --> 00:14:48,632
Ah, what a night!

134
00:14:49,976 --> 00:14:52,264
Elke, Elke. Wait a minute.

135
00:14:52,353 --> 00:14:55,473
We're eating with elderly people now.
Keep that closed.

136
00:14:55,564 --> 00:14:58,316
- Where you been? Come on!
- Oliver, this is Elke.

137
00:14:58,401 --> 00:15:00,144
- Elke, this is Oliver.
- Hi.

138
00:15:00,236 --> 00:15:02,062
Come on. Come on.

139
00:15:02,154 --> 00:15:05,024
Here is to Oliver and Gavin

140
00:15:05,115 --> 00:15:08,733
for ajob well done
on Kentuckyversus Brunswick Coal.

141
00:15:08,827 --> 00:15:09,858
Hear, hear!

142
00:15:09,953 --> 00:15:12,111
- Hell of a litigation.
- Thank you.

143
00:15:12,205 --> 00:15:14,447
l couldn't have done it without you, Oliver.

144
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:18,075
This man has a face
juries can't help but believe.

145
00:15:19,087 --> 00:15:22,787
Gavin told the state attorney general
that if he didn't settle,

146
00:15:22,882 --> 00:15:25,420
next election he'd be running as a gelding.

147
00:15:27,428 --> 00:15:29,753
Well, let's drink up.

148
00:15:32,141 --> 00:15:34,098
Good night, Mom.

149
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:35,844
Good night, sweethearts.

150
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:37,430
- Mom?
- Yeah?

151
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:39,810
Can l take some more dessert to our room?

152
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:42,187
OK! Time for bed. Let's go.

153
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:45,775
- Guess not.
- Kiss... Kiss.

154
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:47,985
Kiss Daddy.

155
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:50,610
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night.

156
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:53,407
- Good night, buddy.
- Good night, Dad.

157
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,119
Sleep well.

158
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,412
l used to be chubby as a kid. Yeah.

159
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:01,960
Let's eat.

160
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,426
Oh, my!

161
00:16:14,806 --> 00:16:16,882
Whatever flavour is this?

162
00:16:17,684 --> 00:16:22,393
No, don't tell me. Let me think now. Uh...

163
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:27,016
- lt isn't apples.
- You make something with apples.

164
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:29,945
- No. Unless you mean baked apples?
- Prunes?

165
00:16:30,029 --> 00:16:34,109
No. Wait a minute.
This is a very special taste...

166
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,319
- Raisins!
- lt isn't pears.

167
00:16:39,913 --> 00:16:44,374
Um... fresh fig with, uh... a little cognac.

168
00:16:44,835 --> 00:16:51,086
- Figs! l never would have thought offigs!
- l never would have guessed.

169
00:16:53,385 --> 00:16:55,757
lt's fantastic, isn't it, Elke?

170
00:16:55,845 --> 00:16:58,134
lt's absolutely spectacular.

171
00:16:58,222 --> 00:17:01,591
- Mrs Marshall, more wine?
- Please.

172
00:17:02,393 --> 00:17:04,682
- Your crystal is lovely.
- Thank you.

173
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:07,059
- lt's not Waterford.
- Baccarat.

174
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,725
Then we are paying our associates too much!

175
00:17:14,738 --> 00:17:17,027
Actually, we got it quite reasonably.

176
00:17:17,115 --> 00:17:20,318
lt's... lt's kind of an interesting story.

177
00:17:21,077 --> 00:17:23,651
Why don't you tell it, Barb?

178
00:17:34,382 --> 00:17:36,873
Well... we were in Paris...

179
00:17:37,218 --> 00:17:39,294
lt was our fifth anniversary.

180
00:17:40,804 --> 00:17:45,846
We'd had lunch in this wonderful place in
the market district, called the Pa-day Crishon.

181
00:17:45,934 --> 00:17:48,556
- Pied de Cochon.
- Thanks.

182
00:17:48,645 --> 00:17:52,394
We were wandering around
and we came upon the...

183
00:17:52,858 --> 00:17:55,562
Rue de Paradis,

184
00:17:55,652 --> 00:17:59,151
where the Baccarat
has its factory and museum.

185
00:17:59,239 --> 00:18:01,990
l didn't know about this before l met Oliver.

186
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,988
My mother bought her glasses at the A&P.

187
00:18:05,077 --> 00:18:09,538
You know, the kind with the raised flowers
that always chipped off after a few weeks.

188
00:18:09,623 --> 00:18:12,293
They were always yellow, remember?

189
00:18:12,376 --> 00:18:17,334
Anyway, here we were in this immense room
filled with all that Baccarat had ever made.

190
00:18:17,423 --> 00:18:22,583
A field of crystal. lt was so... so pretty.

191
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:25,045
l mean, l felt...

192
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:29,597
whatever the word.

193
00:18:29,684 --> 00:18:33,349
And suddenly, from the next room,
we heard the sound of glass breaking.

194
00:18:33,438 --> 00:18:38,230
Well, l looked at Oliver and Oliver
looked at me, and then... Oh... No.

195
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:41,318
Before that,
there was this big, black limousine.

196
00:18:41,404 --> 00:18:44,440
Now, this is important.
Well, before the limousine...

197
00:18:44,532 --> 00:18:48,778
To make a long story short, a couple
had ordered a design for their anniversary.

198
00:18:48,869 --> 00:18:51,360
When it was ready,
they were getting a divorce.

199
00:18:51,455 --> 00:18:53,412
The woman had smashed her half,

200
00:18:53,498 --> 00:18:57,199
and l convinced the man to sell us
his half cheap -just to spite her.

201
00:19:01,631 --> 00:19:05,794
And, uh... that's our Baccarat story.

202
00:19:16,854 --> 00:19:19,855
Well, l think everybody
had a great time, don't you?

203
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:25,183
- To make a long story short, no.
- l'm sorry. You were just rambling on...

204
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:29,358
Tell your own story next time you care
so desperately what everybody thinks.

205
00:19:29,449 --> 00:19:31,525
Fuckface!

206
00:19:32,744 --> 00:19:35,495
- They're my bosses.
- They're Gavin's bosses, too.

207
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,285
lt didn't stop him from getting
a footjob at dinner.

208
00:19:38,374 --> 00:19:43,415
Gavin doesn't care about making partner.
He doesn't have a wife and kids. l do.

209
00:19:46,048 --> 00:19:48,290
You wanna keep living in this apartment?

210
00:19:48,384 --> 00:19:52,049
Because you do not buy a house
on an associate's salary.

211
00:19:52,137 --> 00:19:55,174
At least, not the kind of house that we want.

212
00:19:55,265 --> 00:19:59,049
OK, l care what they think.
l care, all right? l care.

213
00:20:00,187 --> 00:20:02,226
Shoot me.

214
00:20:02,314 --> 00:20:04,769
And that phoney laugh.

215
00:20:06,568 --> 00:20:08,975
That was a genuine laugh.

216
00:20:10,738 --> 00:20:13,656
All right, all right! Maybe l overdid it.

217
00:20:13,741 --> 00:20:16,612
l was just trying to keep things going.

218
00:20:24,418 --> 00:20:27,869
God, l hope they didn't notice
what ajerk l am.

219
00:20:29,131 --> 00:20:31,669
They never seem to.

220
00:20:39,933 --> 00:20:42,009
''Dear Homeowner,

221
00:20:42,101 --> 00:20:44,675
l love your house!''

222
00:20:44,771 --> 00:20:50,974
''lf you ever consider selling,
please... contact me.''

223
00:20:51,068 --> 00:20:52,859
''Barbara Rose.''

224
00:20:52,945 --> 00:20:56,693
Mom! l'm gonna be late for practice!

225
00:20:56,782 --> 00:20:59,783
You've been doing this for a year
and nobody's called.

226
00:20:59,868 --> 00:21:03,367
This is a great house. l love this house.

227
00:21:03,455 --> 00:21:05,531
lt's a waste oftime.

228
00:21:05,624 --> 00:21:08,411
l bet l get this house. Five bucks.

229
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:10,577
Five bucks.

230
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:25,016
- Hello.
- Oh! l was just leaving a note.

231
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,805
How kind. Please, won't you come in?

232
00:21:27,895 --> 00:21:29,971
All right.

233
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:40,652
l don't believe we've met.

234
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,029
- Barbara Rose.
- l'm Maureen.

235
00:21:43,118 --> 00:21:47,779
l don't remember Mother mentioning you,
but she had so many friends.

236
00:21:49,999 --> 00:21:52,704
Oh! Oh, l'm very sorry.

237
00:21:52,793 --> 00:21:55,498
Thank you. She went peacefully.

238
00:21:55,588 --> 00:21:57,913
What am l going to do with this old place?

239
00:21:58,007 --> 00:22:03,842
l just can't bear to put it up for sale and have
a bunch of strangers tromping through it.

240
00:22:03,929 --> 00:22:08,389
lf l could just find someone
who would love it as much as Mom did.

241
00:22:08,475 --> 00:22:12,638
That's more important to me
than whatever money we get for it.

242
00:22:12,729 --> 00:22:15,184
lf you know anybody
who might be interested...

243
00:22:16,566 --> 00:22:21,808
- Can we go up and pick our rooms?
- We can do whatever we want. lt's our house.

244
00:22:21,904 --> 00:22:24,858
Who gets first pick? As if l had to ask.

245
00:22:25,908 --> 00:22:29,241
Don't get scared. We'll do it together.

246
00:22:29,328 --> 00:22:31,534
l just feel kind of strange.

247
00:22:31,622 --> 00:22:34,243
l mean, this house is so beautiful

248
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:36,409
and we live here.

249
00:22:36,501 --> 00:22:39,538
This is who we are? This is me?

250
00:22:44,884 --> 00:22:47,091
- l'll be home early.
- Where are you going?

251
00:22:47,178 --> 00:22:50,927
To work. l wish l didn't have to,
but somebody's got to pay for all this.

252
00:22:51,015 --> 00:22:54,466
- lt's Saturday.
- Come on, this is a great day.

253
00:22:55,728 --> 00:22:58,219
You got the fun part!

254
00:23:06,321 --> 00:23:08,397
Kitchen first.

255
00:23:11,868 --> 00:23:14,359
Everything was working for the Roses.

256
00:23:15,205 --> 00:23:17,281
Let me restate that.

257
00:23:18,249 --> 00:23:21,416
The Roses were working for everything.

258
00:23:21,502 --> 00:23:25,832
Over the next six years, Oliver dug in.
Made senior partner.

259
00:23:25,923 --> 00:23:28,758
The kids lopped off 70, 80 pounds.

260
00:23:28,843 --> 00:23:31,512
And Barbara laboured seven days a week

261
00:23:31,595 --> 00:23:35,759
to create the perfect home
that Oliver always dreamed of.

262
00:23:36,392 --> 00:23:39,143
Not easy for a girl who grew up
drinking her milk

263
00:23:39,228 --> 00:23:42,394
from glasses with chipped, yellow flowers.

264
00:23:42,481 --> 00:23:46,977
There were a million choices...
and she sweated every one of 'em.

265
00:23:47,652 --> 00:23:50,321
She refiinishedall the tables herself.

266
00:23:50,405 --> 00:23:54,189
lt took sixmonths
to get the floors exactly right.

267
00:23:54,617 --> 00:23:59,030
A hundred Sundays to fiind the perfect
Staffordshire fiigures andplates

268
00:23:59,121 --> 00:24:01,873
that she put over the fiireplace.

269
00:24:01,957 --> 00:24:04,448
When you work thathard on something,

270
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:09,086
eventually you have to fiinish
and face the awful question:

271
00:24:09,173 --> 00:24:11,249
''What's left to do?''

272
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:19,344
- Are you working?
- Yes. ls it important?

273
00:24:19,432 --> 00:24:22,469
Yes. Kind of. l hope so.

274
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,185
Stephanie Mayes called to say
thank you for dinner the other night.

275
00:24:27,273 --> 00:24:31,057
She said the pâté l made was so good
l should go into business.

276
00:24:31,152 --> 00:24:34,188
So l asked her if she really meant it
and she said she did,

277
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,067
so l took a pound over to her
and collected $35.

278
00:24:38,492 --> 00:24:42,324
l'd almost forgotten
what it felt like to make money.

279
00:24:42,412 --> 00:24:46,873
- You sold liver to our friends?
- She paid me in cash, Oliver.

280
00:24:46,958 --> 00:24:51,086
Somehow that felt different from
the money l get cashing a cheque.

281
00:24:51,171 --> 00:24:55,382
lt made me feel like...
trading in the Volvo on one ofthose...

282
00:24:55,467 --> 00:25:01,006
four-wheel drive things with the big,
knobby tyres and the 200-horsepower engine.

283
00:25:01,097 --> 00:25:03,848
So l did. l'm gonna pick it up tomorrow.

284
00:25:05,851 --> 00:25:08,342
Thank you so much for telling me.

285
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:14,522
And you think that you... need this?
l mean, the Volvo was a fine car.

286
00:25:14,902 --> 00:25:18,769
- l'll pay for it with my own money.
- How much does it cost?

287
00:25:18,864 --> 00:25:22,992
All right, l know it was kind of crazy
but l just... wanted it, OK?

288
00:25:24,035 --> 00:25:26,324
25,000.

289
00:25:27,872 --> 00:25:31,786
So you only have to sell
700 more pounds of pâté.

290
00:25:33,044 --> 00:25:36,377
Maybe l will. Maybe l'm starting a business.

291
00:25:37,923 --> 00:25:41,921
- But ifyou don't want me to, uh...
- No. No, no, no, no. You do it.

292
00:25:42,011 --> 00:25:44,087
Do it. Do it.

293
00:25:51,395 --> 00:25:53,470
l'm doing it.

294
00:25:59,235 --> 00:26:03,233
Wait a minute. Wait one minute.
l do not understand. What's the, uh...

295
00:26:03,323 --> 00:26:05,648
what's the attitude?

296
00:26:05,741 --> 00:26:07,817
l told you l would handle it.

297
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:12,821
Yeah, and l didn't see anything happening
so l went to Ed and l set up the interview.

298
00:26:12,915 --> 00:26:17,126
- l would have done it.
- Yeah, but sometimes you need a little push.

299
00:26:18,045 --> 00:26:20,500
We all need a little push.

300
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,509
We agreed that,
if you're doing this liver bit,

301
00:26:24,593 --> 00:26:27,796
we would need someone
to take care ofthe house, right?

302
00:26:27,887 --> 00:26:29,963
Right, Oliver. Right again.

303
00:26:30,056 --> 00:26:34,635
Oh, come on. Let's not argue, OK?
Just think about it for a minute!

304
00:26:38,481 --> 00:26:42,313
lf you don't want to interview the lady,
l will send her home.

305
00:26:42,401 --> 00:26:45,651
l'm only trying to make your life easier.

306
00:26:52,828 --> 00:26:57,075
Somehow the thought of a stranger living
in my house just seems weird, you know?

307
00:26:57,165 --> 00:27:00,581
Doesn't it? l don't mean just for us,
but for you, too.

308
00:27:01,127 --> 00:27:04,294
- Oh, but then l guess you do this all the time.
- No, no.

309
00:27:04,714 --> 00:27:09,008
l try this as a means offinding
room and board and a little money.

310
00:27:10,052 --> 00:27:13,836
l'm also attending a few classes
at William and Mary College.

311
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:17,765
But that won't interfere with my duties.

312
00:27:17,852 --> 00:27:20,342
That's great. l'm happy for you - really.

313
00:27:20,771 --> 00:27:24,851
- So, do l get the job?
- The fact is, Susan, l don't need a live-in.

314
00:27:26,276 --> 00:27:28,352
This was my husband's suggestion.

315
00:27:28,445 --> 00:27:32,277
l have raised two kids on my own
and now they're about to go offto college.

316
00:27:32,365 --> 00:27:35,983
- They were both accepted at Harvard.
- That's a nice school, too.

317
00:27:36,077 --> 00:27:37,619
Thanks.

318
00:27:37,704 --> 00:27:40,491
So, anyway, it'll just be
Oliver and me here at home.

319
00:27:40,581 --> 00:27:43,535
Although l am getting going
my own catering business.

320
00:27:43,626 --> 00:27:46,413
But let's face it,
l don't need to work for the money.

321
00:27:46,504 --> 00:27:50,964
And that does not make me one ofthese
women who is married to a successful man

322
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:54,216
and has dedicated her life
to him and her children,

323
00:27:54,303 --> 00:27:59,463
and then has to validate herself as a human
being, because her children are leaving her,

324
00:27:59,558 --> 00:28:02,096
by studying photography
or opening an art gallery

325
00:28:02,185 --> 00:28:06,183
or going into interior design
in her husband's office. No!

326
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:10,984
l have a wonderful house,
crammed with beautiful things.

327
00:28:11,069 --> 00:28:14,603
l did this house myself. l did a greatjob.

328
00:28:14,697 --> 00:28:17,733
Not that l am necessarily
a slave to materialism. No.

329
00:28:18,784 --> 00:28:22,651
But l am proud ofwhat l have accomplished,

330
00:28:22,746 --> 00:28:27,989
although l suppose some people find my life
disgusting. Disgusting is too strong a word.

331
00:28:28,085 --> 00:28:33,459
No, l would not say that many people
would respectthe choices l have made,

332
00:28:33,548 --> 00:28:36,632
although women would. Women like me.

333
00:28:37,802 --> 00:28:41,716
But then l don't care what they think
because l can't stand who they are.

334
00:28:41,806 --> 00:28:45,756
What l'm trying to say, Susan,
is that l don't need a live-in.

335
00:28:48,771 --> 00:28:54,476
Well... thanks for the interview
and good luck, and God bless you.

336
00:28:55,361 --> 00:28:57,519
l would like you to understand

337
00:28:57,613 --> 00:29:01,112
that, if l were to hire you,
my life would probably change.

338
00:29:01,199 --> 00:29:03,690
You would be this new element in the house.

339
00:29:05,954 --> 00:29:08,030
Well...

340
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,948
Let me show you where your room is.

341
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:22,002
Hey, Bennie. Dumb dog.

342
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:32,013
Hey, Bennie!

343
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:34,677
Let's see if he'll go for it again.

344
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:36,767
Bennie...

345
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,521
Yeah, dumb.

346
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:58,914
Oh, the Bennie boy.
The Bennie-Bennie-Bennie boy. Yes.

347
00:29:59,004 --> 00:30:02,041
He's the best boy. He's the best boy!
We love our good boy.

348
00:30:02,132 --> 00:30:04,255
He's a good boy! We love our Bennie boy.

349
00:30:04,343 --> 00:30:06,798
Yes, a pretty dog! He's a pretty dog!

350
00:30:34,455 --> 00:30:36,992
Rose residence.

351
00:30:37,082 --> 00:30:40,665
- Susan, is that for me?
- lt's for Josh.

352
00:30:40,752 --> 00:30:44,417
- Are you expecting a call?
- Jason Larrabee said he'd confirm lunch.

353
00:30:44,506 --> 00:30:47,257
l'm trying to land him as a client.

354
00:30:47,342 --> 00:30:50,924
The word around town is he's up
for a Cabinet post. l wish he'd call.

355
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:53,752
He will.

356
00:30:55,725 --> 00:30:58,725
Did you get a chance
to look over that contract for me?

357
00:30:58,811 --> 00:31:02,678
- What contract?
- On the consulate luncheon l'm doing.

358
00:31:03,315 --> 00:31:06,898
- Oh, yeah. No, but l'll read it this weekend.
- OK.

359
00:31:07,277 --> 00:31:09,484
No. No, not OK.

360
00:31:09,571 --> 00:31:13,900
l have to sign it tomorrow. l gave it
to you last week, but it's probably fine.

361
00:31:13,992 --> 00:31:17,028
- l'll read it now.
- Oh, no, don't bother.

362
00:31:17,329 --> 00:31:19,404
No. Get it.

363
00:31:22,959 --> 00:31:25,035
Sure.

364
00:31:36,388 --> 00:31:38,677
What?! What is it?

365
00:31:38,766 --> 00:31:40,841
lt's a fly. Where'd it go?

366
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,136
On the fridge.

367
00:31:45,647 --> 00:31:48,352
Stay upwind of him.

368
00:31:53,071 --> 00:31:54,980
How about that?

369
00:31:55,615 --> 00:31:57,773
Not bad, huh?

370
00:31:57,867 --> 00:32:00,358
l admire your technique.

371
00:32:04,081 --> 00:32:05,456
Hello.

372
00:32:05,541 --> 00:32:10,119
Mr Larrabee, hi. How are you?
No! No, no, it's not too late.

373
00:32:10,212 --> 00:32:13,545
Could you hang on just one second
while l use the other phone?

374
00:32:13,966 --> 00:32:15,923
Thank you.

375
00:32:19,095 --> 00:32:21,765
Yes, sir. l'm looking forward to that, too.

376
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:24,798
No, no, no. Course you're not bothering me.

377
00:32:24,893 --> 00:32:27,597
Lawyers, we neversleep.

378
00:32:29,272 --> 00:32:31,513
l'm available to you, sir, 24 hours a...

379
00:32:52,168 --> 00:32:56,000
Who left the appliances on in the kitchen?
lt sounds like who knows what!

380
00:32:56,089 --> 00:33:01,296
l must have hit some switches when l was
cleaning up. You know how that can happen.

381
00:33:01,386 --> 00:33:03,508
l got great news.

382
00:33:03,596 --> 00:33:05,754
Lunch is on tomorrow with Larrabee.

383
00:33:06,932 --> 00:33:10,432
l'm gonna meet him
at his club in Philadelphia.

384
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:12,595
He's mine!

385
00:33:12,688 --> 00:33:15,772
Look how crazy you are
about yourself right now.

386
00:33:15,858 --> 00:33:18,693
- l'm sorry.
- Don't apologise.

387
00:33:18,777 --> 00:33:24,233
l live with the assumption that all guys
owe an apology to the woman they live with.

388
00:33:25,575 --> 00:33:27,117
You're so full of shit.

389
00:33:28,328 --> 00:33:31,578
So, where's that little contract ofyours?

390
00:33:31,664 --> 00:33:34,784
Maybe l can up your price, huh?

391
00:33:34,876 --> 00:33:36,952
Where is it?

392
00:33:37,628 --> 00:33:40,201
- You sure it's all right?
- My fee's going up.

393
00:33:40,297 --> 00:33:42,705
Better get me while you can afford me.

394
00:33:46,804 --> 00:33:49,840
- l don't want you to read it.
- Let me have it.

395
00:33:57,439 --> 00:33:59,764
l got you and l'm not gonna let you get away!

396
00:34:01,985 --> 00:34:04,024
Let me go.

397
00:34:04,112 --> 00:34:06,603
Let me go! Let go!

398
00:34:08,783 --> 00:34:10,859
Let go of it! Let go!

399
00:34:17,458 --> 00:34:19,534
Ah, Jesus!

400
00:34:30,011 --> 00:34:33,345
You think you're pretty strong,
don't you?

401
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,732
What the hell is wrong with you?

402
00:34:48,362 --> 00:34:52,609
lf you're with a woman for any length oftime,
eventually you'll ask her that question.

403
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:55,237
lf she doesn't answer, that's trouble.

404
00:34:55,327 --> 00:34:59,905
And when trouble begins, it comes at you
from directions you'd never expect.

405
00:34:59,998 --> 00:35:01,741
Oliver was a sitting duck.

406
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:04,917
l think you're gonna be
very well served by our firm,

407
00:35:05,003 --> 00:35:07,375
especially ifthe rumours are true.

408
00:35:07,463 --> 00:35:11,757
Well, there may be a Senate
confirmation hearing in my future.

409
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:15,792
- We could definitely be of help with that.
- Yes. Waiter... Ohh!

410
00:35:15,888 --> 00:35:19,138
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. l'm fine.

411
00:35:19,225 --> 00:35:22,558
- Could l have some more coffee, please?
- Certainly, sir.

412
00:35:22,644 --> 00:35:25,266
Regarding your Senate confirmation,

413
00:35:25,355 --> 00:35:29,567
it may not be a bad idea for us
to have your personal asset liability...

414
00:35:31,153 --> 00:35:33,394
Oliver?

415
00:35:33,488 --> 00:35:36,193
Do you think you're having a heart attack?

416
00:35:39,911 --> 00:35:43,244
- Call an ambulance!
- Wipe that stuff off his chin.

417
00:35:43,331 --> 00:35:45,822
- Hang in there, Oliver.
- Call my wife.

418
00:35:53,173 --> 00:35:55,213
You're doing just fine.

419
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:59,215
- Somebody called for the defibrillator.
- Right here.

420
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:05,591
How's it goin'?

421
00:36:05,685 --> 00:36:08,390
You may be the only person
l'm doing better than.

422
00:36:10,148 --> 00:36:12,852
The wife stabbed me in the stomach.

423
00:36:14,235 --> 00:36:16,904
With a nail file this time.

424
00:36:16,988 --> 00:36:19,360
She's training to be a manicurist.

425
00:36:19,448 --> 00:36:24,525
- They make good money, you know?
- l'm trying to get a doctor for you, babe.

426
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,743
They always feel bad after.

427
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:29,499
Mr Rose? l'm Dr Gordon.
This is my associate.

428
00:36:29,583 --> 00:36:33,165
- Dr Hillerman. Jason Larrabee called us.
- How are his vital signs?

429
00:36:33,253 --> 00:36:36,289
- We were here first.
- We'll be with you in just a moment.

430
00:36:36,381 --> 00:36:40,248
Babes, take it easy.
Can't you see the guy's dying over here?

431
00:36:40,343 --> 00:36:42,419
- Did someone call my wife?
- Yes.

432
00:36:42,554 --> 00:36:46,385
l need to write her a note...
in case she doesn't get here in time.

433
00:36:46,474 --> 00:36:49,594
- Let's get him to ClCU.
- Jeff, let's go.

434
00:36:51,145 --> 00:36:53,268
l'll get the pen back once we get there.

435
00:36:55,482 --> 00:36:57,724
- ls my wife here?
- l don't think so.

436
00:36:59,027 --> 00:37:01,649
Get me some pictures. Upper Gl.

437
00:37:01,738 --> 00:37:07,527
You're gonna have to swallow some barium.
But you'll like it. lt's peppermint flavoured.

438
00:37:09,788 --> 00:37:12,539
Nothing is more important
than the hors d'oeuvres.

439
00:37:12,624 --> 00:37:15,197
That's where people
make their firstjudgment.

440
00:37:15,293 --> 00:37:19,587
Perdóname, senora. La senora Rose
ha recibido una llamada urgente.

441
00:37:19,672 --> 00:37:22,542
There's an urgent phone call for you.

442
00:37:24,093 --> 00:37:25,468
Hello?

443
00:37:25,553 --> 00:37:27,379
Oh, God!

444
00:37:27,471 --> 00:37:30,388
Oh, my God! All right. l'm leaving right now.

445
00:37:31,058 --> 00:37:34,557
- My husband's had a heart attack.
- That happened to my mother.

446
00:37:34,645 --> 00:37:39,555
Don't worry. Your luncheon's gonna
be terrific. Everything's gonna be great.

447
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:44,652
The x-rays showed an oesophageal tear.
lt's commonly known as a hiatal hernia.

448
00:37:44,946 --> 00:37:46,689
Right there.

449
00:37:46,781 --> 00:37:49,189
The pain symptoms are identical to angina.

450
00:37:49,283 --> 00:37:52,652
Stress, coffee, spicy foods, gas.

451
00:37:52,745 --> 00:37:57,739
Your nerve endings get irritated. You know
what that's like. Not pleasant, but not fatal.

452
00:37:57,833 --> 00:38:00,122
Could you get this hiatal hernia, say,

453
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:03,875
by being squeezed
between someone's legs?

454
00:38:06,133 --> 00:38:07,378
No.

455
00:38:07,467 --> 00:38:10,919
- So l'm not going to die?
- Eventually, but not today.

456
00:38:14,516 --> 00:38:16,804
Thank you.

457
00:38:18,978 --> 00:38:21,386
- You can wait right here.
- Thank you.

458
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:29,895
Oliver! You're alive!

459
00:38:29,989 --> 00:38:33,986
Yeah, it was something else.
lt wasn't the heart, it was a rip. A tear.

460
00:38:34,076 --> 00:38:36,152
You're alive!

461
00:38:36,912 --> 00:38:39,913
- So what are you gonna do?
- Wait for Barbara to pick me up.

462
00:38:39,998 --> 00:38:42,323
- l'll wait with you.
- Good.

463
00:38:44,878 --> 00:38:50,085
Think we can get that nurse to come
back here with a bottle of musk oil?

464
00:38:53,761 --> 00:38:56,679
- She should be here any minute.
- Yeah.

465
00:39:01,602 --> 00:39:04,093
lt's stuffy in these places.

466
00:39:16,366 --> 00:39:20,114
- l got us enough booze for the whole trip.
- Thanks.

467
00:39:20,203 --> 00:39:24,663
l couldn't remember whether you wanted
a twist, so l got you some just in case.

468
00:39:24,749 --> 00:39:26,825
Thank you, Gavin.

469
00:39:31,255 --> 00:39:33,627
- Salud.
- Salud.

470
00:39:44,184 --> 00:39:46,556
All those lives going on out there...

471
00:39:46,645 --> 00:39:51,603
People we'll never meet...
experiencing things we'll never know.

472
00:39:53,026 --> 00:39:55,599
We can't know.

473
00:39:55,695 --> 00:40:01,733
ln your own life, by this point,
you think you know what's gonna be but...

474
00:40:02,285 --> 00:40:05,451
- But you don't know.
- You don't know.

475
00:40:07,248 --> 00:40:10,367
lt's always just when you think
you got it figured out

476
00:40:10,459 --> 00:40:14,670
when, bingo, something comes along
and knocks you right on your ass.

477
00:40:15,589 --> 00:40:19,171
Why do you think Barbara
didn't come to the hospital?

478
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:24,340
l don't know.
She probably had a good reason.

479
00:40:52,415 --> 00:40:54,906
Hiya, Bennie. Come here, sweetheart.

480
00:40:56,127 --> 00:40:59,128
Where is everybody, huh?

481
00:40:59,214 --> 00:41:03,959
l guess you're the only one who
gives a damn about me in this family.

482
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:26,943
Oliver!

483
00:41:27,032 --> 00:41:30,531
You don't know how happy l am to see you!

484
00:41:32,412 --> 00:41:35,863
- You didn't come to the hospital.
- No.

485
00:41:35,957 --> 00:41:38,626
No. Well, l called and...

486
00:41:38,709 --> 00:41:42,125
well, everything seemed to be...
under control.

487
00:41:42,213 --> 00:41:44,834
l just... l didn't want to disturb you.

488
00:41:44,924 --> 00:41:49,135
Disturb me?
Well, l wasn't doing much. Just dying.

489
00:41:49,219 --> 00:41:51,591
Oliver! You weren't dying.

490
00:41:52,431 --> 00:41:55,597
- You didn't even call.
- Of course l did. l talked to someone.

491
00:41:55,684 --> 00:41:58,471
- Not to me.
- Well, l talked to a nurse and...

492
00:41:58,603 --> 00:42:00,892
she said that you weren't dying.

493
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:03,554
Well, l thought l was dying!

494
00:42:06,652 --> 00:42:10,602
l wrote you a note...
in case you didn't get there in time.

495
00:42:14,535 --> 00:42:17,204
l can't read your handwriting.

496
00:42:18,163 --> 00:42:23,370
l was on a gurney being rushed
to lntensive Care in excruciating pain.

497
00:42:24,711 --> 00:42:26,787
lt says:

498
00:42:28,256 --> 00:42:33,001
''My love, by the time you
receive this, l may be gone.''

499
00:42:33,094 --> 00:42:35,763
''My life was... fun...

500
00:42:35,847 --> 00:42:38,883
..full... beyond my dreams.''

501
00:42:42,603 --> 00:42:46,435
''All l have... and all l am, l owe to you.''

502
00:42:48,859 --> 00:42:52,358
''You gave me courage
to surpass what l know l am,

503
00:42:52,446 --> 00:42:54,522
the strength to...''

504
00:42:55,449 --> 00:42:57,774
Oh, this is where l had a spasm.

505
00:42:58,827 --> 00:43:01,781
l can't read it, but the next line says:

506
00:43:01,871 --> 00:43:05,951
''l lie here, feeling my life ebb away.''

507
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:09,623
''l cling to your image.''

508
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:12,333
''l will take you with me to eternity.''

509
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:16,251
''l cherish you.''

510
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:21,342
''l thank merciful God for you.''

511
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:26,758
l didn't have the strength to sign it.

512
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:33,896
l'm... l'm sure they, um...

513
00:43:34,736 --> 00:43:37,690
they would've told me who it was from.

514
00:43:43,536 --> 00:43:46,453
l can't believe
you didn't call us at school, Mother.

515
00:43:46,539 --> 00:43:51,331
l didn't see any point in alarming you until
there was something to be alarmed about.

516
00:43:54,463 --> 00:43:57,713
Your mother didn't want
to disturb anybody today.

517
00:43:58,217 --> 00:44:00,838
Yeah, well, you still should have called.

518
00:44:02,179 --> 00:44:04,255
You should have.

519
00:44:04,347 --> 00:44:07,467
l'm sure your mother didn't want
to worry you needlessly.

520
00:44:07,559 --> 00:44:10,429
The important thing is your father is alive.

521
00:44:18,152 --> 00:44:21,236
We've always been a family
that communicated.

522
00:44:21,322 --> 00:44:25,615
lf anything important happens,
everyone should know about it.

523
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:29,282
That's the rule.

524
00:45:19,127 --> 00:45:22,211
- What's going on?
- l'm very upset.

525
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:30,630
lt's 3 o'clock in the morning.
Turn the television off.

526
00:45:33,765 --> 00:45:37,893
l wasn't sure why l didn't go to the hospital,
but now l think l know.

527
00:45:37,978 --> 00:45:40,647
l'd just like to put today behind us, OK?

528
00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:42,806
OK.

529
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:49,310
l was gonna drive to the hospital,
but l knew you were OK.

530
00:45:50,323 --> 00:45:56,575
Cos l never think that anything really terrible
could happen to me or the kids or you.

531
00:45:58,330 --> 00:46:00,821
And l was getting on the expressway,

532
00:46:00,916 --> 00:46:04,830
and suddenly l had this very strong
feeling that you were dead.

533
00:46:06,421 --> 00:46:10,289
And l knew what it would feel like
to be alone in this house,

534
00:46:10,384 --> 00:46:12,459
to not have you in my life.

535
00:46:13,386 --> 00:46:16,720
And l got so scared, l had to pull over.

536
00:46:20,768 --> 00:46:23,935
Well, you don't have to be scared any more.

537
00:46:27,441 --> 00:46:29,683
l got scared because l felt happy.

538
00:46:47,294 --> 00:46:49,867
You were happy because l was dead?

539
00:46:50,922 --> 00:46:53,627
l was happy to be free.

540
00:46:53,716 --> 00:46:56,421
Like a weight had been lifted.

541
00:46:57,553 --> 00:47:00,471
- Like a weight had been lifted?
- Yeah.

542
00:47:03,058 --> 00:47:07,804
So, how am l supposed to respond?
You tell me you wished l was dead?!

543
00:47:08,564 --> 00:47:11,518
l thought it was important.

544
00:47:39,718 --> 00:47:42,838
l think you owe me an apology, Barbara.

545
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:46,180
lf you have something to say,
l'd like to hear it.

546
00:47:51,646 --> 00:47:54,018
l want a divorce.

547
00:47:58,111 --> 00:48:00,269
No, you don't.

548
00:48:00,363 --> 00:48:02,604
You can't have one!

549
00:48:03,991 --> 00:48:06,529
l've thought about this a lot.

550
00:48:06,619 --> 00:48:09,192
l really don't want to be
married to you any more.

551
00:48:17,212 --> 00:48:19,620
Why do you want a divorce?

552
00:48:19,756 --> 00:48:23,836
Did... did l do something?
Did l... did l notdo something?

553
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:28,175
l can't give you specifics, Oliver.

554
00:48:29,641 --> 00:48:32,392
- Well, try!
- l don't want to try!

555
00:48:37,565 --> 00:48:40,850
ls there somebody else? Another man?

556
00:48:41,193 --> 00:48:42,568
No.

557
00:48:42,653 --> 00:48:45,523
- A woman?
- You wish.

558
00:48:46,573 --> 00:48:48,649
l should be the one asking for a divorce!

559
00:48:48,742 --> 00:48:51,447
l was rushed to hospital
suffering from severe...

560
00:48:51,953 --> 00:48:53,745
lndigestion.

561
00:48:54,497 --> 00:48:58,032
Oh, you're such an expert
at making me look like ajerk.

562
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:01,414
OK, OK, OK. l'm sorry.

563
00:49:01,504 --> 00:49:04,707
l'm the bad person.
Let's just blame me for this.

564
00:49:04,924 --> 00:49:08,091
No! No. l think l need...

565
00:49:08,177 --> 00:49:10,253
l think you owe me,

566
00:49:10,346 --> 00:49:14,675
after this many pretty goddamn good
years of marriage, a solid reason.

567
00:49:14,767 --> 00:49:19,144
l worked my ass offto make enough money
to provide you with a good life,

568
00:49:19,229 --> 00:49:22,100
and you owe me a reason that makes sense.

569
00:49:23,066 --> 00:49:26,767
So let's hear it.
Come on. Let's hear it. Let's hear it!

570
00:49:27,737 --> 00:49:30,228
Because...

571
00:49:30,323 --> 00:49:32,944
when l watch you eat,

572
00:49:33,034 --> 00:49:35,703
when l see you asleep,

573
00:49:35,787 --> 00:49:38,408
when l look at you lately,

574
00:49:38,497 --> 00:49:40,786
l just wanna smash your face in.

575
00:49:44,545 --> 00:49:49,171
Come on, smash my face.
Come on. You wanna smash my face?

576
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:10,770
The next time... l hit back.

577
00:50:13,781 --> 00:50:17,399
And you'd better get yourself
a damn good lawyer.

578
00:50:18,077 --> 00:50:20,828
The best your money can buy.

579
00:50:45,186 --> 00:50:47,427
- What does she want?
- Child support.

580
00:50:47,521 --> 00:50:49,478
l've always taken care of my kids.

581
00:50:49,565 --> 00:50:53,812
And they will be 18 in one year,
which makes it nice for you.

582
00:50:53,902 --> 00:50:59,775
- What about alimony?
- Barbara, against my advice, waives alimony.

583
00:50:59,866 --> 00:51:04,195
l'm making money with my business.
l get a lot of referrals. l can support myself.

584
00:51:04,537 --> 00:51:06,744
Well, l'm a lucky guy.

585
00:51:06,831 --> 00:51:09,749
My client is being more than fair, Mr Rose.

586
00:51:09,834 --> 00:51:14,626
She's waived alimony and she's willing to
waive her rights against your law practice

587
00:51:14,714 --> 00:51:20,170
in exchange for the house and all of
its contents, except your shaving gear and...

588
00:51:20,845 --> 00:51:23,300
his clothing?

589
00:51:23,597 --> 00:51:27,808
- Everything l made went into that house.
- l found that house.

590
00:51:27,893 --> 00:51:31,677
Every piece offurniture is where it is
because l put it there. lt is my house.

591
00:51:31,772 --> 00:51:34,856
lf your client has finished yammering,
explain to her

592
00:51:34,941 --> 00:51:39,069
that a wife does not
automatically get the house.

593
00:51:39,487 --> 00:51:44,647
l thought you told her that
she was entitled to anything and everything.

594
00:51:44,742 --> 00:51:47,315
- l told her what?
- Yes...

595
00:51:48,412 --> 00:51:50,405
Here it is.

596
00:51:50,498 --> 00:51:52,905
l quote: ''My love,

597
00:51:53,751 --> 00:51:56,076
by the time you...''

598
00:51:56,170 --> 00:51:58,246
Boy, what a handwriting.

599
00:51:58,839 --> 00:52:02,706
''By the time you receive this, l may be gone.''

600
00:52:06,763 --> 00:52:11,555
''All l am and all l have, l owe to you.''

601
00:52:13,144 --> 00:52:15,813
You wrote this, Mr Rose?

602
00:52:18,441 --> 00:52:24,561
Excuse me, Mr Thurmont, you tiny,
little, worm-like, infinitesimal prick,

603
00:52:24,655 --> 00:52:28,320
could l have a word with my wife, please?

604
00:52:29,284 --> 00:52:31,241
Certainly.

605
00:52:35,624 --> 00:52:39,075
lf this is a who-can-sink-lowest-fastest
contest, you won.

606
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:42,328
By showing him my letter,

607
00:52:42,422 --> 00:52:47,048
you have sunk below the deepest layer
of prehistoric frog shit

608
00:52:47,135 --> 00:52:49,804
at the bottom of a New Jersey scum swamp.

609
00:52:53,015 --> 00:52:56,135
l may have let you have the house,
but now...

610
00:52:56,227 --> 00:52:58,468
you'll never get it.

611
00:52:58,562 --> 00:53:01,516
You will never get that house.

612
00:53:02,399 --> 00:53:04,771
Do you understand?

613
00:53:05,694 --> 00:53:09,110
You will never get that house.

614
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:16,779
- We'll see.
- Yeah... we'll see.

615
00:53:26,922 --> 00:53:29,413
Maybe l shouldn't have
let you see that letter.

616
00:53:29,508 --> 00:53:32,177
Dear girl, by the time this is all over,

617
00:53:32,261 --> 00:53:35,511
you'll think oftoday
as one ofyour lighter moments.

618
00:53:40,435 --> 00:53:44,896
What do you call 500 lawyers
at the bottom ofthe ocean?

619
00:53:44,981 --> 00:53:47,389
An excellent start.

620
00:53:49,193 --> 00:53:51,945
l used to resentjokes like that.

621
00:53:53,698 --> 00:53:56,449
Now l see them as simple truths.

622
00:53:58,577 --> 00:54:01,282
Lawyers...

623
00:54:04,625 --> 00:54:06,748
Hello.

624
00:54:06,835 --> 00:54:09,871
Honey, l can't talk right now.
l'm with a client.

625
00:54:09,963 --> 00:54:12,999
Love you, miss you, want you... Bye!

626
00:54:17,262 --> 00:54:19,634
l recently married.

627
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:26,806
Which is the last thing l ever thought
l'd do after what happened to the Roses.

628
00:54:26,896 --> 00:54:32,021
When it comes to women...
l hope l'm a better man now than l was.

629
00:54:33,861 --> 00:54:37,810
l know l'm a better lawyer,
when it comes to divorce.

630
00:54:39,158 --> 00:54:43,202
l'll never make another mistake
like l made with Oliver.

631
00:54:45,122 --> 00:54:47,956
Let's just concentrate on the job at hand.

632
00:54:48,041 --> 00:54:50,283
She wants the house. You want the house.

633
00:54:50,794 --> 00:54:54,542
- l'm the one who's living in a hotel room!
- Not for long.

634
00:54:54,631 --> 00:54:57,715
- She claims she found the house.
- She did find it, right?

635
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:02,378
Yeah, but that's not the point. She says
she made it what it is. She didn't. She didn't.

636
00:55:02,805 --> 00:55:07,348
l'm not keeping score but, if l were,
it'd be about 83 to 6 in my favour.

637
00:55:07,434 --> 00:55:09,842
Of all the really... good stuff.

638
00:55:09,937 --> 00:55:12,937
Those wonderful Staffordshire dogs...

639
00:55:13,023 --> 00:55:17,732
ln fact, most ofthe Staffordshires, l found.
And that Art-Deco rug and, uh...

640
00:55:17,819 --> 00:55:22,113
And that stove in the kitchen? She wouldn't
have bought it if l hadn't pushed her!

641
00:55:22,532 --> 00:55:24,904
Shoes. That's what she's good at buying.

642
00:55:24,993 --> 00:55:28,776
l gotta have shelves in the closet
or she'd have them all over the place!

643
00:55:29,122 --> 00:55:32,039
Here we go. You're gonna love this.

644
00:55:32,124 --> 00:55:35,540
Civil Code, Title 16-9-0-4, Section C.

645
00:55:35,628 --> 00:55:40,870
l used this once for a freebie divorce
l did for my cousin Paulie. Total loser.

646
00:55:40,966 --> 00:55:42,508
Read.

647
00:55:42,593 --> 00:55:45,961
''For the purposes of subsections
one and two of paragraphs...''

648
00:55:46,054 --> 00:55:49,838
Here. Skip down to...
''Parties who have pursued separate lives...''

649
00:55:49,933 --> 00:55:53,717
''Parties who have pursued separate
lives sharing neither bed nor board

650
00:55:53,812 --> 00:55:55,970
shall be deemed to have lived apart

651
00:55:56,064 --> 00:55:59,515
even though they reside
under the same roof...''

652
00:56:01,569 --> 00:56:04,274
Even though they reside
under the same roof?

653
00:56:04,363 --> 00:56:07,281
Yeah. The law was put on the books
for poor people:

654
00:56:07,366 --> 00:56:11,114
folks who couldn't afford
separate residences. But we can use it.

655
00:56:11,412 --> 00:56:14,745
- So l can move back in.
- lfyour divorce is settled in court,

656
00:56:14,832 --> 00:56:19,540
it shows you're committed to the property.
Plus, you can see she doesn't sell the assets.

657
00:56:19,628 --> 00:56:22,000
l can work on her,
get her to fold on the house.

658
00:56:22,088 --> 00:56:25,956
No. No, Oliver, you don't even
deal with her. You avoid her.

659
00:56:26,051 --> 00:56:28,126
Women can be a lot meaner than we think.

660
00:56:28,219 --> 00:56:31,303
Never underestimate her as an adversary.
Don't talk to her.

661
00:56:31,389 --> 00:56:34,555
No, no, no, l won't. Don't worry about me.

662
00:56:34,642 --> 00:56:36,551
Gavin...

663
00:56:36,686 --> 00:56:38,512
- Thank you.
- All right.

664
00:56:39,397 --> 00:56:43,346
All right, go on. Go home.

665
00:56:43,692 --> 00:56:47,690
- This is the stupidest thing you've ever done!
- Second stupidest.

666
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:50,531
- You can't stay here!
- The law says l can.

667
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:54,483
Title 16-9-0-4, Section C.

668
00:56:55,704 --> 00:56:58,373
Look it up, tootsie pie.

669
00:57:12,386 --> 00:57:14,379
OK, Mom, you're on.

670
00:57:16,682 --> 00:57:18,758
Let me see that bag.

671
00:57:28,068 --> 00:57:31,234
ls that what you're gonna put on top?

672
00:57:31,321 --> 00:57:33,278
- Yes, it is.
- Fine.

673
00:57:33,364 --> 00:57:35,855
Josh, plug it in, please.

674
00:57:53,842 --> 00:57:55,965
- lt's a short.
- lt's not a short.

675
00:57:56,053 --> 00:57:59,137
One ofthe ornaments
is touching the sockets.

676
00:58:02,851 --> 00:58:05,424
Fine.

677
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:08,437
You take care of it, Oliver.

678
00:58:12,485 --> 00:58:15,651
Come on, it's Christmas time.
Let's get festive.

679
00:58:16,572 --> 00:58:19,692
- l have to go out.
- l got stuff l gotta do in my room.

680
00:58:42,847 --> 00:58:45,931
- Oh, God, my house is on fire!
- Mine too, babe!

681
00:58:46,017 --> 00:58:48,305
Really, you idiot!

682
00:58:51,397 --> 00:58:53,188
Wait up, babe!

683
00:58:54,108 --> 00:58:55,851
Oh, my God!

684
00:58:56,193 --> 00:58:57,936
Omar, do something!

685
00:58:58,028 --> 00:59:00,020
- Fire!
- Mom!

686
00:59:00,155 --> 00:59:02,693
Fire! Fire!

687
00:59:03,408 --> 00:59:05,650
Call the police! l'll get the extinguisher!

688
00:59:05,744 --> 00:59:08,994
991. 999. 911.

689
00:59:10,248 --> 00:59:12,324
- Stay out ofthe way!
- Coming through!

690
00:59:12,417 --> 00:59:16,663
''One: store in a cool place.
Two: hold upright, pull pin out.'' OK.

691
00:59:16,754 --> 00:59:20,372
- ''Three: stand back, aim away from face.''
- Do it!

692
00:59:20,466 --> 00:59:23,586
- Dad, hurry!
- All right! OK, OK! All right. OK, OK.

693
00:59:28,098 --> 00:59:30,589
Dad! The curtain!

694
00:59:47,783 --> 00:59:50,784
lt's over. Thank God l was here!

695
00:59:51,996 --> 00:59:54,072
The whole house could have gone up.

696
00:59:54,164 --> 00:59:58,660
OK, OK. l'll get a sponge
and start cleaning up.

697
00:59:59,419 --> 01:00:02,456
Maybe a rake... or a bulldozer.

698
01:00:23,401 --> 01:00:25,607
lt might not have been the lights.

699
01:00:26,654 --> 01:00:29,145
You always know.

700
01:00:48,549 --> 01:00:52,878
Rather than argue about who supposedly
did what, l'd like to reach some accord.

701
01:00:52,970 --> 01:00:56,006
- Time is passing.
- l'd love to be done with this, too.

702
01:00:56,098 --> 01:00:59,930
Right. lfwe leave settlement to the court,
the lawyers get everything!

703
01:01:00,019 --> 01:01:02,344
So l've come up with a fair solution.

704
01:01:02,438 --> 01:01:04,513
- You wanna hear it?
- Yes.

705
01:01:04,606 --> 01:01:09,268
Now, l understand your point of view.
You've invested 18 years in this marriage.

706
01:01:09,361 --> 01:01:13,987
That's worth a lot.
A tremendous amount. $163,800.

707
01:01:15,033 --> 01:01:18,069
- How did you arrive at that number?
- Fairly.

708
01:01:18,161 --> 01:01:22,953
- You do almost the same things as Susan.
- No! She's in college. She should make more.

709
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:24,583
Barbara!

710
01:01:24,667 --> 01:01:28,534
There is no comparison whatsoever
between what she does and...

711
01:01:28,629 --> 01:01:32,045
Her salary is a base, so l doubled it.

712
01:01:32,132 --> 01:01:34,802
And that wasn't enough,
and then l tripled it,

713
01:01:34,885 --> 01:01:37,802
and that's how l came up with this figure.

714
01:01:37,888 --> 01:01:41,720
$490,633, approximately.

715
01:01:41,808 --> 01:01:44,429
l shall give you that in cash. lt won't be easy.

716
01:01:44,519 --> 01:01:47,092
lt'll be harder than hell,
but l'm gonna do it.

717
01:01:47,188 --> 01:01:50,723
You just have to, you know,
agree to give up the house.

718
01:01:50,817 --> 01:01:55,063
You owe me. You've gotten more out of
knowing me than l've got out of knowing you.

719
01:01:55,154 --> 01:02:00,445
l'm not even gonna ask you what that means.
l found this house! l bought everything in it!

720
01:02:00,534 --> 01:02:04,318
With my money! lt's a lot easier to spend it
than it is to make it, honeybun!

721
01:02:04,413 --> 01:02:07,414
You might not have made it
if not for me, sweet cakes!

722
01:02:07,499 --> 01:02:10,168
You weren't even multiorgasmic
before you met me!

723
01:02:11,253 --> 01:02:13,957
You expect me to keep
reassuring you sexually,

724
01:02:14,047 --> 01:02:16,752
even now when we disgust each other?!

725
01:02:26,350 --> 01:02:29,850
Don't let this bother you.
lt's all gonna work out.

726
01:02:34,358 --> 01:02:37,193
The red areas are hers.

727
01:02:37,277 --> 01:02:39,851
The yellow areas are mine.

728
01:02:39,947 --> 01:02:41,904
Green is neutral.

729
01:02:42,491 --> 01:02:47,034
The kitchen was difficult, but Barbara
came up with the idea oftime allotment.

730
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:51,450
This seems rational to you both?

731
01:02:52,167 --> 01:02:54,289
Yeah.

732
01:02:55,586 --> 01:02:57,662
Oliver, my father used to say

733
01:02:57,755 --> 01:03:01,504
that a man could never outdo a woman
when it came to love or revenge.

734
01:03:01,592 --> 01:03:06,005
Why don't you let her have the house?
There are other houses. And other women.

735
01:03:06,096 --> 01:03:10,592
No, no, no. l'm going to win because
l've got her to accept the ground rules.

736
01:03:10,684 --> 01:03:15,725
Oliver, there is no winning in this.
lt's only degrees of losing.

737
01:03:17,441 --> 01:03:20,311
l got more square footage.

738
01:03:45,667 --> 01:03:50,329
Sorry to disturb you, but l was wondering
if l could borrow a sleeping tablet.

739
01:03:51,715 --> 01:03:55,333
- Did Oliver send you for it?
- No. Actually, no.

740
01:03:58,304 --> 01:04:00,380
All right, you got me there.

741
01:04:00,473 --> 01:04:03,842
Which is good, because l'm
uncomfortable with the charade.

742
01:04:04,185 --> 01:04:08,514
lt's nice to see somebody still
caring for somebody in this house.

743
01:04:09,315 --> 01:04:12,766
- Good night, Susan.
- So, there will be no pills?

744
01:04:13,402 --> 01:04:16,652
Oh, kitty. Kitty, wait.

745
01:04:16,738 --> 01:04:18,814
Kitty, kitty...

746
01:04:36,465 --> 01:04:39,550
Do you want me to call around
to find an open drugstore?

747
01:04:39,635 --> 01:04:41,711
l'll find one.

748
01:04:42,972 --> 01:04:45,723
- Should l come?
- lt's up to you.

749
01:04:46,767 --> 01:04:49,637
- These are my favourite kind of cars.
- lt's a Morgan.

750
01:04:49,728 --> 01:04:51,851
Of course.

751
01:05:05,493 --> 01:05:07,900
lt's cosy.

752
01:05:26,721 --> 01:05:29,129
- What was that?
- A bump of some sort.

753
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:36,057
Oh, Kitty! Oh, mein Gott.

754
01:05:41,277 --> 01:05:46,104
Look, why don't you go into the house
and find a large Ziploc bag?

755
01:05:46,198 --> 01:05:49,033
- Ziploc?
- Yeah.

756
01:05:49,493 --> 01:05:52,363
Oh, kitty. Kitty, kitty, kitty.

757
01:05:52,454 --> 01:05:55,027
So much for the nine lives myth.

758
01:06:09,137 --> 01:06:12,007
Here, kitty. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

759
01:06:13,182 --> 01:06:14,925
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty!

760
01:06:15,017 --> 01:06:16,559
Here, puss, puss, puss!

761
01:06:17,061 --> 01:06:19,137
Here, puss, puss, puss!

762
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:24,808
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

763
01:06:25,861 --> 01:06:28,186
Have you see my cat?

764
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:31,067
Are you talking to me?

765
01:06:40,333 --> 01:06:43,203
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. Come on, kitty.

766
01:06:43,294 --> 01:06:45,619
Here, puss, puss, puss, puss.

767
01:06:45,713 --> 01:06:48,418
Where are you, kitty? Come on!

768
01:06:48,507 --> 01:06:50,714
Here, kitty, kitty!

769
01:06:50,801 --> 01:06:52,877
Come on, kitty, kitty. Come on.

770
01:06:52,970 --> 01:06:55,046
Here, puss, puss, puss.

771
01:06:55,139 --> 01:06:59,183
Here, kitty. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty...

772
01:07:15,658 --> 01:07:19,193
- What did you do with my cat?
- You're letting the heat out.

773
01:07:21,455 --> 01:07:25,951
l know something happened. lnstead
of playing this game, what happened?

774
01:07:26,043 --> 01:07:29,494
- You killed your cat, Barbara.
- What?

775
01:07:31,048 --> 01:07:35,626
Yes. One damn Dalmane and
your kitty would be alive.

776
01:07:35,719 --> 01:07:41,258
l had to get up in the middle ofthe night,
looking for Sominex, and l backed out the...

777
01:08:02,786 --> 01:08:05,277
That supposed to scare me?

778
01:08:09,292 --> 01:08:12,293
lf you're looking for trouble,
Barbara, you found it!

779
01:08:51,082 --> 01:08:55,293
What do you expect?
You killed my cat! You're making me nuts!

780
01:08:55,378 --> 01:08:57,750
Will you please...? l'm asking you to leave!

781
01:08:58,923 --> 01:09:01,414
No, it's my house,

782
01:09:01,508 --> 01:09:04,426
and l'm going to stay.

783
01:09:24,614 --> 01:09:28,611
Frankly, l'm concerned about
you, Oliver. You look haggard.

784
01:09:30,786 --> 01:09:33,075
l feel great.

785
01:09:33,163 --> 01:09:36,579
l'll take time off after the Larrabee
confirmation hearings.

786
01:09:36,667 --> 01:09:39,039
Why don't you take time before?

787
01:09:39,336 --> 01:09:43,583
lt's vital to the firm this comes off
without a hitch. l want you at your best.

788
01:09:44,799 --> 01:09:48,548
l'm at my best. l won't let you down.

789
01:09:48,636 --> 01:09:51,258
l'm in fantastic shape.

790
01:09:53,057 --> 01:09:55,299
l thank you so much for caring.

791
01:10:27,256 --> 01:10:30,590
- Mr D'Amato. There's someone in your office.
- Who?

792
01:10:31,969 --> 01:10:34,840
- Use words, Mary Ann.
- Mrs Rose.

793
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:39,224
l didn't think l should leave her in reception.
What with all the... you know.

794
01:10:39,309 --> 01:10:42,227
Yeah, l know... Yeah, l know!

795
01:10:45,482 --> 01:10:47,854
Barbara.

796
01:10:49,110 --> 01:10:53,606
You really shouldn't be here because
it might be viewed by some as unethical.

797
01:10:53,740 --> 01:10:57,689
Well, l am here... ethical or not.

798
01:11:01,122 --> 01:11:03,529
You don't mind if l tape this

799
01:11:03,624 --> 01:11:07,538
just so no one gets confused
about what was said?

800
01:11:10,756 --> 01:11:13,163
What's on your mind?

801
01:11:14,092 --> 01:11:18,884
Well, since you're the one who
advised Oliver to move back in,

802
01:11:18,972 --> 01:11:21,545
l thought you would
advise him to move out.

803
01:11:21,850 --> 01:11:24,637
Why? Sounds like you two
have things worked out,

804
01:11:24,727 --> 01:11:27,515
with the red areas and the green areas.

805
01:11:27,605 --> 01:11:31,555
Gavin, ever since this thing started,
l've had trouble sleeping.

806
01:11:32,235 --> 01:11:35,070
Most mornings l wake up sobbing.

807
01:11:35,529 --> 01:11:37,736
l'm sorry. That's shitty.

808
01:11:38,324 --> 01:11:41,693
But this morning... l woke up screaming.

809
01:11:42,661 --> 01:11:44,867
And l couldn't stop.

810
01:11:44,955 --> 01:11:49,332
l need this to end. This has to end!

811
01:11:49,793 --> 01:11:52,284
- l suggested selling the house...
- No!

812
01:11:53,338 --> 01:11:56,374
OK. You both seem to agree on that.

813
01:11:56,674 --> 01:11:58,584
Gavin.

814
01:11:58,676 --> 01:12:02,888
l don't have much money,
but l could pay you.

815
01:12:04,307 --> 01:12:07,011
That'd be illegal.

816
01:12:15,734 --> 01:12:18,059
Besides money,

817
01:12:21,490 --> 01:12:25,404
what would it take to get you
to help me, Gavin?

818
01:12:26,620 --> 01:12:30,487
Put your shoes on, Barbara.
l haven't been into feet since '82.

819
01:12:30,582 --> 01:12:33,582
- Have you ever made angry love?
- ls there any other way?

820
01:12:35,670 --> 01:12:38,125
Stop it!

821
01:12:38,214 --> 01:12:41,464
This is ridiculous. Button up!

822
01:12:41,550 --> 01:12:46,046
You wanna settle this? Let's all sit down
and work it out, find some compromise.

823
01:12:46,597 --> 01:12:49,882
- There is no compromise.
- Then l can't help you.

824
01:12:59,776 --> 01:13:01,852
Worth a shot.

825
01:13:10,786 --> 01:13:13,360
You know where l am
if you change your mind.

826
01:13:47,613 --> 01:13:51,741
Sometimes l wonder what might have
happened... if l'd taken her offer.

827
01:13:54,119 --> 01:13:56,195
But l didn't.

828
01:13:58,206 --> 01:14:03,283
l should have seen her toes
in the pit of my crotch as a cry for help.

829
01:14:04,921 --> 01:14:06,997
- Stinking bitch.
- Dumb bastard.

830
01:14:07,090 --> 01:14:08,750
- Slut.
- Scum.

831
01:14:08,841 --> 01:14:10,834
- Filth.
- Faggot.

832
01:14:10,927 --> 01:14:12,753
- Morning, Susan.
- Morning.

833
01:14:19,977 --> 01:14:23,097
- l made you some sandwiches for the trip.
- l'm not hungry.

834
01:14:23,188 --> 01:14:26,853
You may be hungry later.
Why don't you wrap these up?

835
01:14:29,277 --> 01:14:33,192
There's some things l should tell you.
You're going offto college.

836
01:14:33,281 --> 01:14:35,737
- You told me you loved me.
- Yes, l do love you.

837
01:14:35,825 --> 01:14:40,452
And about drugs - don't do 'em. And sex -
don't catch anything. What else is there?

838
01:14:40,538 --> 01:14:43,111
Just... about women.

839
01:14:44,959 --> 01:14:47,035
Don't be led by your emotions.

840
01:14:48,129 --> 01:14:53,205
Just cos you screwed up doesn't mean lwill,
so don't try and put your shit off on me.

841
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:56,218
Josh. Don't leave like this.

842
01:14:56,929 --> 01:15:00,796
- l'm pissed at you!
- So what do you want to do about it?

843
01:15:00,891 --> 01:15:03,216
You wanna take a swing at me?

844
01:15:04,269 --> 01:15:07,934
ls that gonna make you feel better?
Then go ahead.

845
01:15:18,324 --> 01:15:21,907
What are you and Dad gonna do
to each other once we're not around?

846
01:15:21,994 --> 01:15:23,868
Don't be silly.

847
01:15:23,954 --> 01:15:27,121
Your father and l need some
time alone to work things out.

848
01:15:28,208 --> 01:15:31,209
By the time summer school starts,
we'll have it settled.

849
01:15:31,295 --> 01:15:36,040
Then l'll make a celebration dinner and
l'll bring it up - or you can come here.

850
01:15:36,133 --> 01:15:38,421
We'll work it out.

851
01:15:38,510 --> 01:15:40,798
- You promise?
- Sure.

852
01:15:42,764 --> 01:15:45,089
You know l love you.

853
01:15:46,225 --> 01:15:49,428
- My sweet girl.
- So...

854
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:51,596
l'll be back for my things.

855
01:15:51,814 --> 01:15:54,519
l will be thinking the best for you.

856
01:15:56,068 --> 01:15:58,144
So long.

857
01:15:58,237 --> 01:16:01,191
- Take care, Susan.
- Goodbye!

858
01:16:08,330 --> 01:16:11,414
- You have a great time, kids.
- Don't worry about us.

859
01:16:11,499 --> 01:16:13,575
Bye!

860
01:16:18,631 --> 01:16:20,707
Here, Bennie.

861
01:16:30,934 --> 01:16:36,141
At 15, l became an evolutionist,
and it all became clear.

862
01:16:36,231 --> 01:16:38,022
We came from mud.

863
01:16:38,108 --> 01:16:43,268
And after 3.8 billion years of evolution,
at our core is still mud.

864
01:16:44,322 --> 01:16:46,647
No divorce lawyer can doubt that.

865
01:16:49,952 --> 01:16:54,246
We can nail her. She's having
a black-tie dinner at 8 o'clock tonight.

866
01:16:54,332 --> 01:16:57,582
The food critic from The Post
called to confirm the time.

867
01:16:57,668 --> 01:17:00,455
She sent me this phoney
exterminator's notice

868
01:17:00,546 --> 01:17:04,875
saying the house is being gassed
for termites, so l'd stay away.

869
01:17:04,967 --> 01:17:09,510
- She can have dinner parties.
- She lied about the exterminator.

870
01:17:09,596 --> 01:17:11,505
She can lie.

871
01:17:11,598 --> 01:17:14,267
She took two of my Staffordshire figures.

872
01:17:14,351 --> 01:17:17,221
Any dealer would give you
at least $1,000 for them.

873
01:17:17,312 --> 01:17:19,885
She is financing her dinner with my things.

874
01:17:19,981 --> 01:17:23,681
l want to file criminal charges
and l want her thrown in jail.

875
01:17:24,318 --> 01:17:28,945
- Unless you have proof, there aren't grounds.
- Wait a minute. Whose side are you on?

876
01:17:29,031 --> 01:17:31,024
Did she get to you?

877
01:17:31,117 --> 01:17:33,690
- Did you bang her?
- Not at all!

878
01:17:35,537 --> 01:17:39,120
She was great. She was a gymnast.

879
01:17:41,835 --> 01:17:44,207
She was?

880
01:17:45,005 --> 01:17:47,293
Yeah.

881
01:17:47,382 --> 01:17:49,707
Look, Oliver...

882
01:17:49,801 --> 01:17:51,710
l lost my train ofthought.

883
01:17:51,803 --> 01:17:54,128
Come on, Gavin. Let's have her arrested.

884
01:17:54,222 --> 01:17:58,930
l don't think you should stay in the house.
Sell the house and divide the proceeds.

885
01:17:59,852 --> 01:18:04,929
No. You're selling me out. You don't
think l got the guts to go to the mat.

886
01:18:05,024 --> 01:18:07,312
You don't want to go to this mat, Oliver.

887
01:18:07,401 --> 01:18:12,193
Look. l respect you, Oliver.
You're a professional. l'm a professional.

888
01:18:12,281 --> 01:18:15,981
As a professional and a friend,
l'm telling you, one way or another,

889
01:18:16,076 --> 01:18:18,614
you're gonna lose. Give it up.

890
01:18:19,996 --> 01:18:22,154
l understand what you're saying.

891
01:18:25,877 --> 01:18:27,953
You're fired.

892
01:18:34,427 --> 01:18:37,096
Now, some ofthe dishes tonight are new.

893
01:18:37,179 --> 01:18:39,931
Some, l've no doubt made for you before.

894
01:18:40,015 --> 01:18:46,018
But they are all my favourite dishes
as you are all my favourite clients.

895
01:18:50,066 --> 01:18:52,688
Hello, darling. Sorry l'm late.

896
01:18:53,403 --> 01:18:58,397
Well, l guess l'd better not sit too close
to anybody because l have a bit of a cold.

897
01:19:15,299 --> 01:19:18,335
Now l guess l'll go in and piss on the fish.

898
01:19:25,517 --> 01:19:29,265
Oliver, these people are my clients.
You are messing with my business.

899
01:19:29,354 --> 01:19:32,473
l have the food editor
from The Postout there.

900
01:19:33,191 --> 01:19:35,479
ls everything all right?

901
01:19:39,321 --> 01:19:43,401
- l would never humiliate you like this.
- You're not equipped to, honey.

902
01:19:51,958 --> 01:19:54,532
Leaving so soon, baby doll? Huh?

903
01:19:54,961 --> 01:19:57,250
A family tiff seems to be developing.

904
01:19:57,338 --> 01:20:02,712
l don't know ifwe should leave, but
l definitely advise skipping the fish course.

905
01:20:13,729 --> 01:20:15,353
No!

906
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:26,234
What...? What...? What are you doing?!

907
01:20:26,324 --> 01:20:28,815
What...? What are you doing?!

908
01:20:30,036 --> 01:20:33,322
Do you see what she's doing?!
Do you see that?!

909
01:21:44,106 --> 01:21:46,858
Get out ofthe car, hon.

910
01:21:49,528 --> 01:21:51,817
You're gonna have to kill me.

911
01:21:54,366 --> 01:21:56,572
l mean it, Oliver.

912
01:21:56,660 --> 01:21:59,067
You don't have the guts!

913
01:21:59,454 --> 01:22:01,945
Come on. Come on!

914
01:22:32,319 --> 01:22:34,726
This is absurd. lt's just absurd.

915
01:22:54,923 --> 01:22:56,999
OK, the gloves are off.

916
01:23:00,929 --> 01:23:03,883
Look, l don't wanna create a scene.

917
01:23:03,974 --> 01:23:07,140
l mean, l, uh,
live in this neighbourhood, too.

918
01:23:07,227 --> 01:23:09,433
But the gloves are off!

919
01:23:17,028 --> 01:23:19,104
Chickenshit.

920
01:23:39,633 --> 01:23:42,302
Your guests would have loved this.

921
01:23:47,348 --> 01:23:50,515
l expected a little more
imagination from you, Ollie.

922
01:23:55,856 --> 01:23:58,312
Guess l'll go clean up.

923
01:24:20,296 --> 01:24:22,787
Not the Staffordshires.

924
01:24:25,092 --> 01:24:28,627
- You love them as much as l do.
- More.

925
01:25:06,924 --> 01:25:09,212
Don't you touch that.

926
01:25:11,386 --> 01:25:13,462
What are you doing?!

927
01:25:21,521 --> 01:25:23,394
- Give that to me!
- Let go!

928
01:25:23,481 --> 01:25:25,438
Give it to me!

929
01:25:35,492 --> 01:25:37,568
Good night.

930
01:25:58,598 --> 01:26:00,674
Bennie?

931
01:26:02,685 --> 01:26:04,594
Bennie!

932
01:26:07,481 --> 01:26:09,557
Bennie?

933
01:26:17,991 --> 01:26:22,404
The Bermuda high-pressure system is
keeping hot weatherin the Potomac area.

934
01:26:22,495 --> 01:26:24,571
Look fora high today of92 degrees.

935
01:26:24,664 --> 01:26:27,119
Not a good day to do strenuous exercise.

936
01:26:27,208 --> 01:26:30,873
Good advice, especiallyifyou
have respiratoryproblems.

937
01:26:30,962 --> 01:26:33,168
Sara Murphyis at the Pentagon

938
01:26:33,255 --> 01:26:36,790
with a report on whether women
still fiind uniforms sexyformen.

939
01:26:36,884 --> 01:26:39,754
So far, it was a pretty normal
divorce scenario.

940
01:26:39,845 --> 01:26:43,759
A few bruises, some broken dishes,
a pissed-on fish.

941
01:26:43,849 --> 01:26:47,846
But l think you should have
a drink for this next part.

942
01:26:49,437 --> 01:26:54,183
There are two dilemmas...
that rattle the human skull.

943
01:26:56,736 --> 01:27:00,484
How do you hold onto
someone who won't stay?

944
01:27:01,908 --> 01:27:05,857
And how do you get rid of
someone who won't go?

945
01:27:55,667 --> 01:27:59,000
l opened a great old one, to let it breathe.

946
01:28:04,884 --> 01:28:07,291
You look beautiful.

947
01:28:07,803 --> 01:28:10,010
- l feel good.
- l do, too.

948
01:28:10,097 --> 01:28:13,466
The Larrabee confirmation hearing
went very well today.

949
01:28:16,312 --> 01:28:21,436
l was surprised, happily surprised,
by your invitation.

950
01:28:23,193 --> 01:28:27,356
Thank you for the wine.
l hope it's not poisoned.

951
01:28:39,625 --> 01:28:41,701
Same here.

952
01:29:21,540 --> 01:29:24,410
- We've made a mess ofthings, Oliver.
- We sure have.

953
01:29:25,002 --> 01:29:29,295
- l want to start living a normal life again.
- l do too, Barbara.

954
01:29:29,881 --> 01:29:35,124
Sitting here like this, it's...
it's hard to believe we can't be happy.

955
01:29:36,137 --> 01:29:39,506
We can be happy... just not together.

956
01:29:40,433 --> 01:29:43,469
l want to ask you one last time to leave.

957
01:29:45,438 --> 01:29:48,392
l can't do that. l won't.

958
01:29:50,150 --> 01:29:52,688
You make so much money, Oliver.

959
01:29:52,778 --> 01:29:55,530
You can buy another house
and replace everything.

960
01:29:55,739 --> 01:29:57,815
Except you.

961
01:29:58,575 --> 01:30:03,735
You may find this hard to believe...
but l still love you.

962
01:30:03,830 --> 01:30:06,403
l still...

963
01:30:06,499 --> 01:30:08,575
want you.

964
01:30:10,295 --> 01:30:15,122
- l find it hard to believe.
- What you can't believe is l don't want you.

965
01:30:17,426 --> 01:30:20,961
Well, l... Yeah, l have
a problem with that. l mean,

966
01:30:21,055 --> 01:30:23,462
l think l'm a good person, as people go...

967
01:30:26,185 --> 01:30:29,020
What can we do to patch things up?

968
01:30:30,856 --> 01:30:33,975
- l don't know.
- Tell me.

969
01:30:34,067 --> 01:30:36,640
- l can't.
- Please.

970
01:30:36,736 --> 01:30:40,604
- l don't know.
- Please tell me. Please?

971
01:30:40,698 --> 01:30:43,154
- Just tell me.
- Stop it!

972
01:30:45,912 --> 01:30:48,485
l guess you don't wanna talk about it.

973
01:30:48,581 --> 01:30:50,739
No, l don't wanna talk about it.

974
01:30:50,833 --> 01:30:52,624
Oliver,

975
01:30:52,710 --> 01:30:57,621
if you don't get out of here now,
you have no idea how far l'll go.

976
01:30:57,798 --> 01:30:59,874
How far? Tell me.

977
01:30:59,967 --> 01:31:03,335
We've been horrible to each other,
but we had something - we still do.

978
01:31:03,428 --> 01:31:05,753
We haven't passed any point of no return.

979
01:31:07,098 --> 01:31:10,633
- l have.
- l'm not convinced.

980
01:31:10,727 --> 01:31:14,511
Nobody who makes pâté this good
can be all bad.

981
01:31:19,652 --> 01:31:23,103
That depends on what the pâté is made of.

982
01:31:33,415 --> 01:31:35,657
Woof.

983
01:31:44,300 --> 01:31:46,092
Bennie?

984
01:31:49,013 --> 01:31:51,634
A good dog to the last bite.

985
01:31:59,356 --> 01:32:01,894
Goddamn you!

986
01:32:03,986 --> 01:32:06,690
Jesus Christ!

987
01:32:57,828 --> 01:32:59,904
l'll give you the chandelier.

988
01:33:16,721 --> 01:33:18,595
Barbara?

989
01:33:20,016 --> 01:33:21,594
Shit!

990
01:33:21,684 --> 01:33:25,812
You can't get out!
l'm gonna find you, sweetness.

991
01:33:26,272 --> 01:33:28,597
l know this house too well!

992
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:32,107
Where the hell is she?

993
01:35:01,529 --> 01:35:04,649
l guess l'm on top now. And you're helpless.

994
01:35:05,449 --> 01:35:08,284
l can do anything l want.

995
01:35:08,369 --> 01:35:10,361
Stop it! l mean it! Stop it!

996
01:35:15,292 --> 01:35:18,127
Oh, God. Oh, you smell so dirty-sweet.

997
01:35:20,380 --> 01:35:23,666
Oh, Barbie... Oh, we need this, Barbie. Yeah...

998
01:35:23,758 --> 01:35:25,798
No, don't talk!

999
01:35:25,885 --> 01:35:28,211
Don't talk. Oliver,

1000
01:35:29,139 --> 01:35:33,599
l want to say hello
to the bald avenger. Please.

1001
01:35:36,729 --> 01:35:38,971
You haven't called him that in years.

1002
01:35:41,901 --> 01:35:44,937
Oh, Barbara! Oh, Barbara! Oh!

1003
01:35:46,822 --> 01:35:48,898
Oh, yes!

1004
01:35:52,786 --> 01:35:54,862
Oh, Barbara...

1005
01:36:00,043 --> 01:36:02,119
Oh, God!

1006
01:36:18,143 --> 01:36:20,385
Was it as good for you as it was for me?

1007
01:37:04,312 --> 01:37:06,518
Oh, what's going on here?

1008
01:37:41,723 --> 01:37:43,845
Oh, l'm sorry.

1009
01:37:43,933 --> 01:37:46,056
l thought you were Barbara.

1010
01:37:46,769 --> 01:37:50,469
Mr Rose, what's going on here? Are you OK?

1011
01:37:51,357 --> 01:37:53,812
l'm... l'm fine. Fine.

1012
01:37:54,860 --> 01:37:56,734
Listen, Susan,

1013
01:37:56,820 --> 01:38:01,197
l'm in the middle of something now.
l... l... l really can't talk about it.

1014
01:38:01,283 --> 01:38:03,275
Let me get the door for you.

1015
01:38:03,368 --> 01:38:06,986
- ls Mrs Rose all right?
- Yes, she's fine.

1016
01:38:08,081 --> 01:38:11,699
Where is she? ls she OK?
You're sure she's all right?

1017
01:38:11,793 --> 01:38:15,411
Barbara. Susan's here!

1018
01:38:15,505 --> 01:38:19,087
- She wants to know ifyou're OK.
- Never better.

1019
01:38:23,470 --> 01:38:25,842
Thank you for dropping by, Susan.

1020
01:38:26,640 --> 01:38:29,012
Come outside with me, Mr Rose.

1021
01:38:29,101 --> 01:38:31,177
Let's go.

1022
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:37,682
Wait a minute. l forgot something.

1023
01:38:38,401 --> 01:38:40,441
What?

1024
01:38:40,528 --> 01:38:42,604
- Barbara.
- No!

1025
01:38:42,697 --> 01:38:45,532
Mr Rose! Mr Rose!

1026
01:38:46,784 --> 01:38:48,860
Oh, no!

1027
01:38:51,497 --> 01:38:54,866
Oh, mein Gott. Mrs Rose!

1028
01:39:49,677 --> 01:39:52,133
What fresh hell is this?

1029
01:40:27,088 --> 01:40:29,164
Hi.

1030
01:40:31,675 --> 01:40:34,047
l brought you a surprise.

1031
01:41:25,018 --> 01:41:26,891
You are ajerk.

1032
01:41:33,943 --> 01:41:36,019
l'll tell you what.

1033
01:41:37,529 --> 01:41:40,067
You say it's mine

1034
01:41:40,157 --> 01:41:43,111
and you can have everything in this house.

1035
01:41:44,745 --> 01:41:46,737
OK.

1036
01:41:46,830 --> 01:41:48,621
lt's mine.

1037
01:42:25,992 --> 01:42:29,906
Barbara! Barbara, l'm sorry.
Are you all right? You OK?

1038
01:42:29,996 --> 01:42:31,194
You OK?

1039
01:43:15,581 --> 01:43:17,953
Well, well, well!

1040
01:43:21,420 --> 01:43:25,464
l'd be glad to help you...
in exchange for the house.

1041
01:43:26,549 --> 01:43:28,092
No.

1042
01:43:28,176 --> 01:43:32,090
Please don't break
the terrazzo floor when you land.

1043
01:43:40,229 --> 01:43:42,685
Oh! That's better.

1044
01:43:48,821 --> 01:43:52,189
l'm gonna save you whether you like it or not.

1045
01:43:52,282 --> 01:43:54,654
That won't work.

1046
01:43:55,327 --> 01:43:57,818
lt's too heavy. lt'll pull you off.

1047
01:43:58,121 --> 01:44:00,612
lt'll work.

1048
01:44:18,015 --> 01:44:19,390
Oliver!

1049
01:44:36,491 --> 01:44:38,567
Almost.

1050
01:44:40,119 --> 01:44:42,610
All right. All right.

1051
01:44:44,081 --> 01:44:47,082
l think l can swing this over to the balcony.

1052
01:44:47,168 --> 01:44:49,374
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

1053
01:44:51,672 --> 01:44:55,539
l loosened the bolt.
l was gonna drop it on you.

1054
01:44:56,802 --> 01:44:59,174
Ooh, that's a good one.

1055
01:45:05,143 --> 01:45:07,301
Gavin! Gavin!

1056
01:45:08,521 --> 01:45:12,353
- Gavin...
- Uh, Susan, let me stop the car first!

1057
01:45:12,441 --> 01:45:15,691
Thank God you're here!
l thought you'd never arrive.

1058
01:45:15,778 --> 01:45:18,233
They're in there. They're over the edge!

1059
01:45:19,949 --> 01:45:25,073
l guess at this point, there's no reason
to be anything but absolutely honest.

1060
01:45:26,246 --> 01:45:30,623
Through all that's happened...
l always loved you.

1061
01:45:33,461 --> 01:45:35,537
l know.

1062
01:45:37,966 --> 01:45:40,801
And through all this,

1063
01:45:40,885 --> 01:45:43,341
you loved me too, didn't you?

1064
01:45:51,812 --> 01:45:54,137
Get that, would you, Oliver?

1065
01:45:56,733 --> 01:46:00,019
- No?
- No, no. OK, we go in.

1066
01:46:03,698 --> 01:46:05,276
Oh, mein Gott.

1067
01:46:06,117 --> 01:46:08,869
Oliver! Barbara!

1068
01:46:08,953 --> 01:46:10,578
- Gavin!
- Gavin!

1069
01:46:10,914 --> 01:46:14,247
- Gavin, get a ladder!
- OK!

1070
01:46:18,379 --> 01:46:20,786
l knew everything would be all right.

1071
01:46:29,139 --> 01:46:30,717
Gavin!

1072
01:46:33,185 --> 01:46:36,221
- Gavin!
- Gavin!

1073
01:46:43,736 --> 01:46:47,070
We're gonna be all right.
You see those two wires?

1074
01:46:47,156 --> 01:46:48,401
Yeah.

1075
01:46:48,616 --> 01:46:52,993
Each ofthem can hold... at least 200 pounds.

1076
01:48:06,690 --> 01:48:08,979
We're coming!

1077
01:49:11,210 --> 01:49:14,210
Mein Gott. They are dead.

1078
01:49:35,608 --> 01:49:37,600
Some story, huh?

1079
01:49:42,531 --> 01:49:45,318
What's the moral?

1080
01:49:45,409 --> 01:49:49,572
Other than dog people should marry
dog people and cat people, cat people.

1081
01:49:52,040 --> 01:49:54,827
l don't know.

1082
01:49:54,918 --> 01:49:57,491
lt could be just this:

1083
01:49:57,587 --> 01:50:01,631
a civilised divorce
is a contradiction in terms.

1084
01:50:03,634 --> 01:50:07,085
Maybe because ofwhat happened,
l've become too traditional.

1085
01:50:07,179 --> 01:50:11,129
Maybe it's not natural to stay
married to one person for life.

1086
01:50:11,809 --> 01:50:14,097
My parents did it.

1087
01:50:14,186 --> 01:50:16,262
63 years.

1088
01:50:16,897 --> 01:50:19,601
A few of 'em good!

1089
01:50:23,111 --> 01:50:25,602
So, look. Here it is.

1090
01:50:25,697 --> 01:50:28,484
We can begin.

1091
01:50:28,575 --> 01:50:30,650
When it comes to your wife,

1092
01:50:30,743 --> 01:50:36,247
l'm going to urge you to be generous
to the point of night sweats.

1093
01:50:37,208 --> 01:50:42,747
The all-important thing is to get you through
this as quickly and cleanly as possible

1094
01:50:42,838 --> 01:50:46,005
so that you can begin rebuilding your life.

1095
01:50:46,091 --> 01:50:48,167
OK?

1096
01:50:50,762 --> 01:50:52,838
Or...

1097
01:50:55,392 --> 01:50:57,633
you can get up

1098
01:50:57,727 --> 01:51:00,052
and go home,

1099
01:51:00,146 --> 01:51:04,309
and try to find some shred

1100
01:51:04,400 --> 01:51:08,647
of what you once loved about
the sweetheart ofyour youth.

1101
01:51:14,076 --> 01:51:16,152
lt's your life.

1102
01:51:19,081 --> 01:51:21,406
Take a minute.

1103
01:51:57,576 --> 01:52:01,359
Hi, what are you doing?
l'm coming home. Love you. Bye.
