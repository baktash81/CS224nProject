00:00:39,908 --> 00:00:42,116
<i>What's missing
from this picture?</i>

3
00:00:44,068 --> 00:00:45,668
<i>We'll start with extraction,</i>

4
00:00:45,699 --> 00:00:48,483
<i>which is a fancy word
for trashing the planet.</i>

5
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:50,627
<i>But this looks like
is we chop down the trees,</i>

6
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:52,645
<i>we blow up the mountains
to get the metals inside</i>

7
00:00:52,676 --> 00:00:54,211
<i>and use up all the water,</i>

8
00:00:54,243 --> 00:00:56,355
<i>and we wipe out the animals.</i>

9
00:00:58,597 --> 00:01:01,155
<i>We are running out
of resources.</i>

10
00:01:01,187 --> 00:01:03,268
<i>Now, I know this can be hard
to hear, but it's the truth.</i>

11
00:01:03,301 --> 00:01:06,052
<i>So we've got to deal with it.</i>

12
00:01:06,085 --> 00:01:07,811
<i>In the past
three decades alone,</i>

13
00:01:07,844 --> 00:01:10,052
<i>one-third of the planet's
natural resource space</i>

14
00:01:10,084 --> 00:01:11,908
<i>has been consumed.</i>

15
00:01:11,941 --> 00:01:13,475
<i>Gone.</i>

16
00:01:13,508 --> 00:01:15,268
<i>We are cutting and mining
and hauling</i>

17
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,668
<i>and trashing the place so fast
that we're undermining</i>

18
00:01:17,701 --> 00:01:21,251
<i>the planet's very ability
for people to live here.</i>

19
00:01:21,284 --> 00:01:23,588
<i>We have 5%
of the world's population,</i>

20
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,819
<i>but we're using 30%
of the world's resources.</i>

21
00:01:26,851 --> 00:01:29,699
<i>If everybody consumed
at U.S. rates,</i>

22
00:01:29,731 --> 00:01:32,579
<i>we would need
three to five planets.</i>

23
00:01:32,611 --> 00:01:34,724
<i>And you know what?</i>

24
00:01:34,755 --> 00:01:36,611
<i>We've only got one.</i>

25
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:31,043
Oh, my God.

26
00:03:07,876 --> 00:03:10,659
You live in that?

27
00:03:10,692 --> 00:03:13,732
Seriously?

28
00:03:19,748 --> 00:03:22,179
Does your chicken have a name?

29
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:27,875
Chicken.

30
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:29,252
Chicken?

31
00:03:29,284 --> 00:03:31,300
Chicken.

32
00:03:31,332 --> 00:03:34,724
Where's all your stuff?

33
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:35,940
I divested.

34
00:03:35,972 --> 00:03:37,860
Cut myself down
to a hundred things.

35
00:03:37,892 --> 00:03:40,452
What do you mean,
a hundred things?

36
00:03:40,484 --> 00:03:42,724
Shirt's one thing,
bowl's one thing,

37
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:46,468
fork, sleeping bag, chicken.

38
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,196
And you kept that hat?

39
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,667
Tell me you at least have a gun.

40
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:58,531
Jesus, Waldo.

41
00:04:01,892 --> 00:04:04,452
When's the last time
you had anybody up here?

42
00:04:04,484 --> 00:04:05,796
Three years.

43
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,684
You got any friends?

44
00:04:07,716 --> 00:04:09,955
Chicken.

45
00:04:13,348 --> 00:04:14,883
Wow.

46
00:04:14,915 --> 00:04:18,276
What the fuck is that?

47
00:04:18,308 --> 00:04:20,515
I bought the land
from a sculptor.

48
00:04:20,547 --> 00:04:24,644
Sure, because this spoke to you,
right?

49
00:04:26,596 --> 00:04:29,668
Remember that time
we were supposedly "broken up"?

50
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,748
I ran into you outside
the art museum on Wilshire.

51
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,636
I was on a date.

52
00:04:33,668 --> 00:04:35,300
I ditched the guy.

53
00:04:35,332 --> 00:04:37,795
We went straight to your truck
in the parking structure.

54
00:04:39,268 --> 00:04:41,635
It was right next to
the La Brea Tar Pits.

55
00:04:41,667 --> 00:04:44,004
By the mammoths.

56
00:04:44,036 --> 00:04:45,732
Okay.

57
00:04:45,764 --> 00:04:47,748
First of all,
this isn't a mammoth.

58
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,379
It's an elephant.

59
00:04:49,411 --> 00:04:52,388
Second of all, you're saying
I bought this property

60
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,500
because I had a subconscious
sexual memory

61
00:04:54,532 --> 00:04:56,292
prompted by this sculpture.

62
00:04:56,324 --> 00:04:59,268
Which you brought me straight to
the minute I came to visit you.

63
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,803
Uninvited.

64
00:05:03,364 --> 00:05:05,060
Look, I'm here on business.

65
00:05:05,092 --> 00:05:07,780
- Alastair Pinch, the actor...
- Killed his wife.

66
00:05:07,812 --> 00:05:10,724
Look, maybe he killed her,
maybe he didn't.

67
00:05:10,756 --> 00:05:13,540
I don't think he even knows.
The guy's a blackout drunk.

68
00:05:13,572 --> 00:05:15,267
The network's got a lot riding
on him,

69
00:05:15,299 --> 00:05:16,516
so they're paying
for his lawyer.

70
00:05:16,548 --> 00:05:17,668
So he did kill her.

71
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,332
It means the money's serious.

72
00:05:19,364 --> 00:05:21,027
They're looking to hire a P.I.

73
00:05:21,059 --> 00:05:24,420
This gig could jump me
to the majors.

74
00:05:24,452 --> 00:05:26,308
If I could deliver the famous
Charlie Waldo

75
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,316
to work it with me...

76
00:05:29,348 --> 00:05:30,756
Come on.

77
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:33,156
You know these Hollywood types.

78
00:05:33,188 --> 00:05:35,780
They always want to put
a big name in it.

79
00:05:35,812 --> 00:05:38,307
I'm retired.

80
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:40,324
I see that.

81
00:05:40,356 --> 00:05:43,075
From the force.

82
00:05:43,107 --> 00:05:46,436
I'd be willing to go 80/20,
yours.

83
00:05:46,468 --> 00:05:48,292
What would I even do
with the money?

84
00:05:48,324 --> 00:05:50,532
Buy a nicer hundred things.

85
00:05:50,564 --> 00:05:52,164
'Cause then my life
would be complete?

86
00:05:52,196 --> 00:05:53,603
Exactly.

87
00:05:55,587 --> 00:05:58,116
Pass.

88
00:05:58,148 --> 00:05:59,780
Lydell was a long time ago.

89
00:05:59,812 --> 00:06:00,996
Lorena.

90
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,436
You don't have to
keep punishing yourself.

91
00:06:02,468 --> 00:06:03,556
You don't have to
live like this.

92
00:06:03,588 --> 00:06:05,284
You don't have to
live like that.

93
00:06:05,316 --> 00:06:07,588
Fuck, you expect me
to apologize?

94
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,091
Hey, I grew up poor.

95
00:06:09,124 --> 00:06:12,835
For-real poor,
not with solar panels.

96
00:06:12,867 --> 00:06:16,100
Bye.

97
00:06:16,132 --> 00:06:18,980
Come on, let me bring you back
into the real world.

98
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:23,044
Just for a few weeks.
We'll have some laughs.

99
00:06:23,076 --> 00:06:24,772
I can't.

100
00:06:27,364 --> 00:06:31,460
All right.
It was worth a shot.

101
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:34,084
Can I have a hug at least?

102
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,788
You ghosted me, Waldo.

103
00:06:44,644 --> 00:06:46,820
I ghosted everybody.

104
00:06:46,852 --> 00:06:49,636
I know.

105
00:06:49,667 --> 00:06:51,876
You smell better than you look.

106
00:06:58,724 --> 00:07:00,548
You can't stay up here forever.

107
00:07:00,579 --> 00:07:03,715
No? Why not?

108
00:07:03,748 --> 00:07:07,588
Same reason you and I
kept hooking back up.

109
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,604
Unfinished business is a bitch.

110
00:07:18,244 --> 00:07:19,492
<i>Things are not looking good</i>

111
00:07:19,524 --> 00:07:21,444
<i>for celebrated actor
Alastair Pinch.</i>

112
00:07:21,476 --> 00:07:23,875
<i>He's under renewed scrutiny
by the LAPD</i>

113
00:07:23,908 --> 00:07:25,348
<i>regarding the murder
of his wife,</i>

114
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,140
<i>Monica Pinch, two weeks ago.</i>

115
00:07:27,172 --> 00:07:29,379
<i>Investigators say they are
focusing their inquiries</i>

116
00:07:29,412 --> 00:07:32,292
<i>on the actor himself
as the prime suspect.</i>

117
00:07:56,228 --> 00:07:58,500
Jesus, Waldo.

118
00:08:02,436 --> 00:08:04,195
You know, you shouldn't do that.

119
00:08:04,228 --> 00:08:06,500
Call a cop.

120
00:08:06,532 --> 00:08:09,091
Mm.

121
00:08:09,124 --> 00:08:10,659
Mm.

122
00:08:13,604 --> 00:08:17,220
Lorena Nascimento was out here
a couple days ago, huh?

123
00:08:17,252 --> 00:08:20,228
Oh, yeah? I'd have to check
my visitor's log.

124
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:21,764
Don't jerk me.

125
00:08:21,796 --> 00:08:24,451
She's been scoping you
for the Pinch murder.

126
00:08:24,484 --> 00:08:28,260
That dumb bastard's
the least of her worries.

127
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:29,763
She say anything about Don Q?

128
00:08:29,796 --> 00:08:31,492
Is he a game show host?

129
00:08:31,524 --> 00:08:33,188
Captain of industry.

130
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:36,227
A recreational pharmaceutical
industry.

131
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,316
Your girl's on his payroll.

132
00:08:37,348 --> 00:08:38,820
That sounds like bullshit.

133
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,164
Oh, that's not bullshit.

134
00:08:40,196 --> 00:08:41,828
You check out her ride?

135
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,620
Where do you think she gets
that kind of cheese?

136
00:08:43,651 --> 00:08:46,116
Where does a cop with four kids
get the cheese for a 'Vette?

137
00:08:46,148 --> 00:08:48,388
- Ha-ha-ha.
- You dropped this.

138
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,828
Fucking dick.

139
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,188
Anyway, she took something
that belonged to Don Q.

140
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,756
Not exactly
the healthiest lifestyle choice.

141
00:08:54,788 --> 00:08:59,523
And what I think is she came up
here to leave it with you.

142
00:08:59,556 --> 00:09:01,060
Leave what?

143
00:09:01,091 --> 00:09:02,532
And if you're smart,
you will give it to me.

144
00:09:02,564 --> 00:09:04,708
I don't know what it is.
I haven't seen her.

145
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,148
Stop wasting my time, man.

146
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,651
The last thing she did
on a computer

147
00:09:07,684 --> 00:09:09,028
was Google Map this ass pile.

148
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,108
The last call on her cell
was from Idyllwild.

149
00:09:11,139 --> 00:09:12,932
What do you mean last call?

150
00:09:12,963 --> 00:09:14,436
There a missing-persons open?

151
00:09:14,468 --> 00:09:15,748
Hell no.

152
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,604
That would require
somebody gave a shit.

153
00:09:17,636 --> 00:09:20,643
What?

154
00:09:20,676 --> 00:09:22,467
Oh, Jesus.

155
00:09:46,563 --> 00:09:47,940
<i>This is Lorena.</i>

156
00:09:47,971 --> 00:09:49,284
<i>You can leave a message,</i>

157
00:09:49,316 --> 00:09:51,140
<i>but if you want me
to call you back,</i>

158
00:09:51,172 --> 00:09:52,996
<i>you better make it interesting.</i>

159
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,876
Fuck you, Lorena.

160
00:10:18,628 --> 00:10:20,067
Damn!

161
00:10:22,628 --> 00:10:23,876
Yo, hit him again.

162
00:10:23,907 --> 00:10:24,996
Come on.
Hit him again.

163
00:10:25,028 --> 00:10:28,388
- Hit him.
- Ooh!

164
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,660
Oh, he gonna
fuck your white ass up.

165
00:10:30,692 --> 00:10:32,131
Hit him again.
Hit him again.

166
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:33,284
Wait, wait, wait!

167
00:10:33,316 --> 00:10:34,948
Here we go.
Hit him again.

168
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,196
Whatever the problem is here,

169
00:10:36,227 --> 00:10:40,996
let's see if we can...
communicate.

170
00:10:41,027 --> 00:10:42,372
Is that a purse?

171
00:10:42,404 --> 00:10:43,972
It's a Bottega, motherfucker.

172
00:10:44,004 --> 00:10:45,475
Oh, shit.

173
00:10:49,604 --> 00:10:52,195
Oh, shit. What the fuck
did you hit him with?

174
00:10:52,228 --> 00:10:53,572
Yeah. Yeah.

175
00:10:53,604 --> 00:10:55,364
Yo, come on, big man.

176
00:10:55,396 --> 00:10:57,091
Bam, then that's it.

177
00:10:57,124 --> 00:10:58,563
That's the one.

178
00:10:58,596 --> 00:11:00,324
Come on, big fella.

179
00:11:00,356 --> 00:11:04,100
- Oh, that's it. That's it.
- What do you morons want?

180
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:05,828
Hey, hold on, hold on, hold on.

181
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,196
Relax, big man.

182
00:11:08,228 --> 00:11:11,076
We want you to stay your ass up
on this motherfucking mountain.

183
00:11:11,108 --> 00:11:12,804
And stay away from
Alastair Pinch.

184
00:11:12,836 --> 00:11:14,468
Yeah. That's right.
And if you don't,

185
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,651
you gonna get more visits from

186
00:11:15,684 --> 00:11:17,763
the Palisade Posse,
motherfucker.

187
00:11:20,773 --> 00:11:22,084
The fuck is wrong with him?

188
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:23,108
Help me up.

189
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,579
Come on.

190
00:11:24,613 --> 00:11:25,828
Yo, what are you doing?

191
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,267
He's asking for help.

192
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,740
What the fuck are you doing?

193
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,212
I hate to break it
to you, boys...

194
00:11:30,243 --> 00:11:32,867
I've got nothing to do
with Alastair Pinch.

195
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,179
Bullshit.

196
00:11:34,213 --> 00:11:36,003
You work for the network.
It's in the trades.

197
00:11:36,036 --> 00:11:38,724
Let me see.

198
00:11:38,756 --> 00:11:39,747
Boom.

199
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,860
It's upside-down, moron.

200
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,988
Yeah, that's right.

201
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:47,653
What the fuck?

202
00:11:47,684 --> 00:11:49,220
Knock him out, dawg.
Come on.

203
00:11:52,484 --> 00:11:55,172
Just stay your hillbilly ass
out of L.A., bitch.

204
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,940
<i>This is Lorena.
You can leave a message,</i>

205
00:13:07,971 --> 00:13:10,020
<i>but if you want me
to call you back,</i>

206
00:13:10,052 --> 00:13:11,173
<i>you better make it interesting.</i>

207
00:13:11,204 --> 00:13:12,836
<i>The mailbox is full</i>

208
00:13:12,867 --> 00:13:14,820
<i>and cannot accept new messages
at this time.</i>

209
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,957
Mr. Waldo.

210
00:14:01,988 --> 00:14:03,844
Wilson Sikorsky,
head of the network.

211
00:14:03,877 --> 00:14:07,235
Hop in. You know Fontella Davis,
Alastair Pinch's attorney?

212
00:14:07,268 --> 00:14:08,773
Never had the pleasure.

213
00:14:08,804 --> 00:14:10,340
Hold on. Hang on.
Hang on.

214
00:14:10,371 --> 00:14:12,004
No.
No, I'm not paying him $40,000.

215
00:14:12,035 --> 00:14:14,755
I'll pay him $25,000.
He should be kissing my balls.

216
00:14:14,788 --> 00:14:16,196
What was the last series he had?

217
00:14:16,227 --> 00:14:17,859
Two years, he'll be playing
Sasquatch

218
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:19,044
on the Discovery Channel.

219
00:14:19,076 --> 00:14:21,924
Hey, why would you
put in the trades

220
00:14:21,956 --> 00:14:23,555
that I was working
for your network?

221
00:14:23,588 --> 00:14:24,901
Mr. Waldo, when you land a star,

222
00:14:24,932 --> 00:14:26,308
you don't hide him
under your ass.

223
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:27,684
You tell the whole
fucking world.

224
00:14:27,716 --> 00:14:29,444
You were the youngest ever
captain of the LAPD.

225
00:14:29,475 --> 00:14:30,531
Did we get that right?

226
00:14:30,564 --> 00:14:32,195
Youngest Detective III.

227
00:14:32,228 --> 00:14:34,084
Yeah, close enough.
We want you to start right away

228
00:14:34,115 --> 00:14:36,517
even though Lorena Nascimento
seems unavailable.

229
00:14:36,548 --> 00:14:39,301
She's missing. When's the last
time you talked to her?

230
00:14:39,332 --> 00:14:42,308
No. No.
Fuck no.

231
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,844
That I can work with.
Then you do your homework.

232
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,188
She's gonna be
exactly like a mother.

233
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,619
- You have kids, Mr. Waldo?
- No.

234
00:14:47,651 --> 00:14:49,571
I'm gonna give you my cellphone.

235
00:14:49,604 --> 00:14:51,364
Don't call the office.
My new assistant's a fuckwit.

236
00:14:51,395 --> 00:14:52,547
But call me day or night,
though.

237
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,179
I got to get this tied up.

238
00:14:54,211 --> 00:14:56,195
You may or may not be aware
I'm facing a takeover.

239
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,988
And I won't you on NCN
with me tonight.

240
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:00,004
I assume you know
how to find a barbershop.

241
00:15:00,035 --> 00:15:01,891
Hey, guys.

242
00:15:01,924 --> 00:15:05,188
Thing is, I never told Lorena
I'd do this.

243
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,228
Sorry.

244
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,635
So I tell you
my nuts are in a vise,

245
00:15:09,668 --> 00:15:11,876
you give them an extra turn?

246
00:15:11,908 --> 00:15:14,755
You want more money,
just have your reps call me.

247
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:16,804
The show's worth twice now
what it used to be.

248
00:15:16,837 --> 00:15:19,139
This murder thing has done
wonders for the ratings.

249
00:15:19,171 --> 00:15:20,516
I could probably get
$6 mill an ep,

250
00:15:20,548 --> 00:15:22,084
but, you know,
I got to have 100 episodes,

251
00:15:22,115 --> 00:15:23,461
and I only got 57.

252
00:15:23,492 --> 00:15:25,891
So I need two more years
of... watch the cable...

253
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:28,899
Alastair Pinch healthy,
happy, and off of death row.

254
00:15:28,931 --> 00:15:30,788
I can't take this.

255
00:15:30,819 --> 00:15:32,197
I only own 100 things.

256
00:15:32,228 --> 00:15:34,084
If I take that,
it's gonna be 101, you know?

257
00:15:34,117 --> 00:15:35,140
Not really.

258
00:15:35,173 --> 00:15:36,579
Well, it's complicated.

259
00:15:36,611 --> 00:15:38,371
Let's go with
one of the other P.I.s.

260
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,228
I know we said we needed
to create distraction.

261
00:15:40,259 --> 00:15:41,540
But this?
Come on.

262
00:15:41,571 --> 00:15:43,108
Big fan of your work too.

263
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:45,091
A real P.I., one that knows
how to do the job,

264
00:15:45,124 --> 00:15:47,139
- not just some has-been.
- All right. Look.

265
00:15:47,171 --> 00:15:48,548
Hey, hey, hey. Shh.

266
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:51,301
I'm only here to tell you
to put out a press release

267
00:15:51,332 --> 00:15:53,027
that says I'm not involved,
all right?

268
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,788
That I turned it down.
Can you do that?

269
00:15:54,819 --> 00:15:55,940
This is the hottest gig in town.

270
00:15:55,971 --> 00:15:57,635
Everybody's chasing it.

271
00:15:57,668 --> 00:15:59,780
Here's what I'll do.
I'll introduce you to Alastair.

272
00:15:59,811 --> 00:16:01,828
I'll pay you for the day whether
you take the case or not.

273
00:16:01,861 --> 00:16:06,243
Excuse me.
Hey. Yeah. No. I'm on...

274
00:16:06,275 --> 00:16:08,131
What was Lorena gonna charge?

275
00:16:08,163 --> 00:16:10,628
- $1,000 a day plus expenses.
- $2,000, and not to me.

276
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:13,412
A donation to the Sierra Club
in memory of Lydell Lipps.

277
00:16:13,444 --> 00:16:15,715
Deal. It's a shame
the kids are gonna miss this.

278
00:16:15,748 --> 00:16:18,308
You're about to meet
a motherfucking legend.

279
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,965
So,
Stevie and I were at my estate.

280
00:16:20,996 --> 00:16:22,435
I was drinking absinthe,

281
00:16:22,468 --> 00:16:23,747
and several snifters in,

282
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,499
I decided that this would be
the perfect night

283
00:16:26,531 --> 00:16:29,283
to teach Stevie Wonder
how to drive.

284
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,644
And that it might be
most entertaining

285
00:16:32,677 --> 00:16:36,548
to let him motor about the lawn
with me outside the car,

286
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,276
- trying to dodge it.
- Excuse me.

287
00:16:38,308 --> 00:16:39,492
I need a shoot, Mr. Pinch.

288
00:16:39,524 --> 00:16:41,412
Oh, thank you, cherub.

289
00:16:41,444 --> 00:16:44,005
Anyway, I thought I'd give
Stevie a sporting chance.

290
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:46,212
So there I was,
trousers around my ankles,

291
00:16:46,244 --> 00:16:49,411
Stevie gave it some stick,
and I spent the next fortnight

292
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:51,619
pissing claret in Ward C.

293
00:16:51,652 --> 00:16:53,636
Where's my mustache fluffer?

294
00:16:53,668 --> 00:16:55,780
Last looks.

295
00:16:55,812 --> 00:16:58,692
Let me know when we're set.

296
00:16:58,724 --> 00:17:00,995
<i>Grazie,</i> babies.

297
00:17:01,028 --> 00:17:02,372
Ohh.

298
00:17:02,404 --> 00:17:03,939
Sustained.

299
00:17:03,971 --> 00:17:05,188
"Sustrained."

300
00:17:05,221 --> 00:17:06,628
So stained.

301
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:07,875
Is he shit-faced?

302
00:17:07,907 --> 00:17:09,188
Come on.

303
00:17:11,812 --> 00:17:14,403
It is such a privilege
to get to watch this man work.

304
00:17:14,435 --> 00:17:15,652
He's got a shitload
of Shakespeare Awards

305
00:17:15,685 --> 00:17:16,868
under his bed.

306
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,435
Greatest fucking actor
since Brando.

307
00:17:18,467 --> 00:17:20,068
I get him Wednesday nights
after Jessica Biel.

308
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:22,211
Love this job.

309
00:17:22,244 --> 00:17:24,292
Background.

310
00:17:24,325 --> 00:17:27,428
And... action!

311
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,188
Let me tell you a story

312
00:17:29,221 --> 00:17:32,675
from when I was just a tyke
in Tuscaloosa.

313
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:35,395
My granddaddy,
Raymond Forbishaw,

314
00:17:35,427 --> 00:17:36,836
he was a jurist himself.

315
00:17:36,868 --> 00:17:38,725
Family court.

316
00:17:38,756 --> 00:17:41,701
He used to set me on his knee
and say,

317
00:17:41,732 --> 00:17:45,541
"Johnnie, for 99 days,
the judge's job

318
00:17:45,572 --> 00:17:49,476
is merely to be that blindfold
on the statue of Lady Justice.

319
00:17:49,508 --> 00:17:53,188
For 99 days, you do that,
and justice,

320
00:17:53,221 --> 00:17:56,260
in its natural wisdom,
will find its own way.

321
00:17:56,292 --> 00:17:58,467
But, Johnnie," he'd say...

322
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,348
"...on the 100th day,

323
00:18:05,379 --> 00:18:10,596
a great judge knows
that he needs to <i>be</i> justice."

324
00:18:10,628 --> 00:18:13,891
Now, I wouldn't be so bold as to
call myself a great judge,

325
00:18:13,923 --> 00:18:17,795
but I do know
that as I sit here today,

326
00:18:17,828 --> 00:18:20,771
I'm thinking about
my granddaddy.

327
00:18:20,804 --> 00:18:23,651
And that's why
I'm gonna direct this verdict

328
00:18:23,684 --> 00:18:28,580
and find this here defendant...
guilty.

329
00:18:28,612 --> 00:18:30,565
Cut!

330
00:18:30,596 --> 00:18:32,324
Alastair, that was terrific.

331
00:18:32,356 --> 00:18:34,660
Terrific?
It was bloody genius.

332
00:18:34,692 --> 00:18:36,484
You're not going
to top that one.

333
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:38,019
I'll see you all tomorrow then.

334
00:18:38,051 --> 00:18:39,747
Did you hear what I just said?

335
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:41,635
He's supposed to say
"not guilty."

336
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:44,579
- He said guilty.
- Fuck.

337
00:18:44,611 --> 00:18:45,925
Could have just told me
I had ass cancer.

338
00:18:45,956 --> 00:18:46,948
Sorry.

339
00:18:46,981 --> 00:18:48,708
- Alastair.
- Yes?

340
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:51,428
Oh, God,
I hate to do this to you,

341
00:18:51,459 --> 00:18:53,540
but we're gonna have
to do one more.

342
00:18:53,572 --> 00:18:56,388
- The last line is "not guilty."
- "Not guilty."

343
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,019
- What did I say?
- Guilty.

344
00:18:58,051 --> 00:19:00,196
- The fuck I did.
- Yeah, he didn't say that.

345
00:19:00,228 --> 00:19:01,795
Did... I mean,
but really, just please?

346
00:19:01,827 --> 00:19:03,044
No.
I know what I said, love.

347
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:04,675
So let's just look
at the playback.

348
00:19:04,707 --> 00:19:06,276
He wouldn't have said that.

349
00:19:06,308 --> 00:19:08,643
Can we just see
the playback, please?

350
00:19:08,675 --> 00:19:10,531
You... What are you smirking at?

351
00:19:10,563 --> 00:19:12,515
What? I didn't say anything.

352
00:19:12,548 --> 00:19:14,948
Do you think it's easy
to carry this piece of shit

353
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,708
on my shoulders week after week?

354
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,339
You think I need a twat like you

355
00:19:18,372 --> 00:19:20,099
standing there
hoping I'll cock it up?

356
00:19:20,131 --> 00:19:22,468
How long have you worked
on the show?

357
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,068
It's my first week.

358
00:19:24,099 --> 00:19:26,372
Your first week.
It's his first week, everyone.

359
00:19:33,635 --> 00:19:35,108
God!

360
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,483
<i>And that's why I'm gonna</i>

361
00:19:36,515 --> 00:19:37,732
<i>direct this verdict...</i>

362
00:19:37,765 --> 00:19:39,267
Let that be a lesson to you.

363
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:41,412
- You good?
- I'm fine.

364
00:19:41,444 --> 00:19:42,436
<i>...guilty.</i>

365
00:19:42,468 --> 00:19:43,525
Let's do this.
Come on.

366
00:19:43,556 --> 00:19:45,572
Let's do it. Let's roll.

367
00:19:45,604 --> 00:19:47,556
Rolling!

368
00:19:47,588 --> 00:19:48,995
Does that happen often?

369
00:19:49,028 --> 00:19:51,076
Sometimes after lunch.

370
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:53,699
We always put a stunt guy
right there, pay him extra.

371
00:19:53,731 --> 00:19:55,236
Don't tell Alastair.

372
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,212
Ready?

373
00:19:58,244 --> 00:19:59,812
Action.

374
00:19:59,845 --> 00:20:02,275
"...and find
this here defendant

375
00:20:02,307 --> 00:20:04,259
not guilty."

376
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:07,171
Cut!

377
00:20:07,203 --> 00:20:10,115
Wouldn't be the first time
I've had the clap.

378
00:20:22,628 --> 00:20:25,028
<i>Entrez.</i>

379
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,588
"Not guilty."

380
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:30,596
Ah, lord of the manor, down to
slum a bit with the vassals.

381
00:20:30,628 --> 00:20:32,195
To what do we owe the honor?

382
00:20:32,228 --> 00:20:34,596
I wanted to introduce you
to Charlie Waldo,

383
00:20:34,628 --> 00:20:36,260
the detective we told you about.

384
00:20:36,292 --> 00:20:38,020
He used to be king shit
at the LAPD.

385
00:20:38,052 --> 00:20:39,940
Ah, the fallen angel.
You've landed him.

386
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:41,380
Didn't I promise you I would?

387
00:20:41,412 --> 00:20:42,884
I'd give you the shirt
off my back. You know that.

388
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:44,772
I'd prefer the watch
off your wrist.

389
00:20:44,804 --> 00:20:46,563
Have you seen
what this man wears?

390
00:20:46,596 --> 00:20:48,419
Costs more than the house
I grew up in.

391
00:20:48,451 --> 00:20:51,363
Kudoke Skeleton.
They only make 35 a year.

392
00:20:51,396 --> 00:20:52,836
Maybe I'll make you
a wrap gift of one. How's that?

393
00:20:52,868 --> 00:20:54,724
Can we have that
signed in blood?

394
00:20:54,756 --> 00:20:56,740
"Signed in blood,"
he says.

395
00:20:56,772 --> 00:20:59,236
I'm done for the day, Detective.
Do you have plans?

396
00:20:59,268 --> 00:21:01,092
- Where do you live?
- Idyllwild.

397
00:21:01,124 --> 00:21:03,460
- I'm only here for today.
- Details we're sorting out.

398
00:21:03,492 --> 00:21:05,796
I haven't agreed
to take this case.

399
00:21:05,828 --> 00:21:07,236
I'll find a hotel for tonight.

400
00:21:07,268 --> 00:21:08,579
Nonsense.
You'll stay at my house.

401
00:21:08,611 --> 00:21:09,764
Great idea.

402
00:21:09,796 --> 00:21:11,172
Right to the scene of the crime.

403
00:21:11,204 --> 00:21:12,548
You don't mind sleeping

404
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,307
surrounded by yellow tape,
do you?

405
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:17,444
This fucking guy.

406
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:18,564
Come on, Waldo.
What do you say?

407
00:21:18,596 --> 00:21:19,556
What's the worst
that can happen?

408
00:21:19,588 --> 00:21:21,059
Lorena turns up in a day or two,

409
00:21:21,091 --> 00:21:23,971
you can go back
to wherever you came from.

410
00:21:24,004 --> 00:21:26,052
Hell, maybe even get
your reputation back.

411
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:28,196
Just kidding.

412
00:21:35,844 --> 00:21:39,331
Interest you
in a wee snifter, Detective?

413
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:41,508
No, thank you.

414
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,820
I deplore drinking alone,

415
00:21:42,852 --> 00:21:44,324
so I'll have a double.

416
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:50,308
She was so proud of this room.

417
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,100
Chin-chin.

418
00:21:52,132 --> 00:21:55,748
It was in <i>Town and Wanker</i>
magazine, you know.

419
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:58,403
Why don't you walk me
through that morning?

420
00:22:02,084 --> 00:22:03,812
All right.

421
00:22:03,844 --> 00:22:05,540
One more time.

422
00:22:08,131 --> 00:22:10,148
It was a Saturday.

423
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:13,891
I woke up... or came to...
in my study,

424
00:22:13,924 --> 00:22:16,804
about a half a mile
down that way.

425
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:19,812
I realized I had no recollection
of the previous night.

426
00:22:19,844 --> 00:22:23,908
I came in here.
Found my sweet Monica.

427
00:22:25,796 --> 00:22:29,859
I ran back to the kitchen,
dialed 911.

428
00:22:29,892 --> 00:22:33,412
There was a shattered vase.

429
00:22:33,444 --> 00:22:35,300
Anyhow,
when the ambulance arrived,

430
00:22:35,332 --> 00:22:36,996
they told me
she was already gone

431
00:22:37,028 --> 00:22:39,715
and had been
for quite some time.

432
00:22:42,212 --> 00:22:44,964
Does anyone else have keys?

433
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:47,812
Only Rosario. That's our nanny.

434
00:22:47,844 --> 00:22:50,500
And she was in Venezuela
visiting her family.

435
00:22:50,532 --> 00:22:51,876
Nanny?

436
00:22:51,908 --> 00:22:53,540
You have kids in the house?

437
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:56,452
Yes.
We have one child, Gaby.

438
00:22:56,484 --> 00:22:58,180
She likely wasn't
the killer either,

439
00:22:58,212 --> 00:23:00,260
but she'll be home
from kindergarten soon enough

440
00:23:00,292 --> 00:23:03,140
if you think it's worth
trying to wrest a confession.

441
00:23:03,172 --> 00:23:05,316
Pretty glib, considering.

442
00:23:05,348 --> 00:23:06,852
Forgive me.

443
00:23:06,884 --> 00:23:09,700
Dear Gaby doesn't even know,
of course, but...

444
00:23:11,684 --> 00:23:14,404
...the world is certain
I murdered my wife, Mr. Waldo,

445
00:23:14,436 --> 00:23:17,796
and I can't even tell you
the world is wrong.

446
00:23:17,828 --> 00:23:20,420
If you know a man who's handled
a similar predicament

447
00:23:20,452 --> 00:23:22,948
with more élan, point me to him,

448
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,860
and I shall gladly emulate.

449
00:23:25,891 --> 00:23:28,132
You ever thought about trying
to stop drinking?

450
00:23:31,268 --> 00:23:34,179
All the time.

451
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:37,956
But this doesn't seem the week
for that, now, does it?

452
00:23:37,988 --> 00:23:39,331
Daddy!

453
00:23:39,364 --> 00:23:41,540
Princess Ozma,
where did you come from?

454
00:23:41,572 --> 00:23:43,300
Oh, oh, oh.

455
00:23:43,332 --> 00:23:46,436
Want to hear the song Little Dog
taught us at school today?

456
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:48,868
A little dog?
Why, yes, of course.

457
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:52,100
♪ Brush every morning,
brush every night ♪

458
00:23:52,132 --> 00:23:56,196
♪ I brush and I brush
so my teeth will be white ♪

459
00:23:56,228 --> 00:23:59,524
♪ Teeth can be shiny,
teeth can be gold ♪

460
00:23:59,556 --> 00:24:03,492
♪ I hope I still have some
when I'm very old ♪

461
00:24:04,836 --> 00:24:06,564
- You know it.
- I do know it, Gaby.

462
00:24:06,596 --> 00:24:10,692
I'd like to meet my new friend,
Mr. Waldo.

463
00:24:10,724 --> 00:24:13,988
He looks scary. Like a lion.

464
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,748
Yeah, but he's a friendly lion.

465
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,884
Gaby and I are going to spend
some daddy time before bed,

466
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,804
you snuggly baby.

467
00:24:20,836 --> 00:24:25,732
Oh, you haven't decided
to take the case yet, have you?

468
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:27,428
What say you, Detective?

469
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:30,756
Will you return to your mountain
and leave me to the fates?

470
00:24:30,788 --> 00:24:33,028
Or will you stick around
the shitty of the angels

471
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:36,612
long enough to see the police
maybe get it right this time?

472
00:24:36,644 --> 00:24:38,403
Whatever right may look like.

473
00:24:38,436 --> 00:24:41,796
Daddy, can Mr. Lion drive
to school with us tomorrow?

474
00:24:41,828 --> 00:24:43,748
Can he please?

475
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,796
Please?

476
00:24:47,747 --> 00:24:49,604
Yay!

477
00:24:55,779 --> 00:24:57,476
Will this be all right?

478
00:24:59,684 --> 00:25:01,091
It's perfect.

479
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,604
Fucking Lorena.

480
00:25:32,292 --> 00:25:35,812
<i>Guilty.</i>

481
00:25:35,844 --> 00:25:37,348
<i>...and turn down the volume
on the media circus.</i>

482
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,627
<i>Oh, come on, Fontella.</i>

483
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,388
<i>You live for the media circus.</i>

484
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,732
<i>Now I'm hearing there could be
an indictment</i>

485
00:25:41,763 --> 00:25:43,140
<i>as early as tomorrow.</i>

486
00:25:43,171 --> 00:25:44,612
<i>We've not been told that.</i>

487
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:46,020
<i>And now the</i> L.A. Times
<i>is reporting</i>

488
00:25:46,051 --> 00:25:47,396
<i>that sources on the LAPD say</i>

489
00:25:47,427 --> 00:25:49,252
<i>there are no
unidentified fingerprints</i>

490
00:25:49,284 --> 00:25:50,372
<i>anywhere in that room.</i>

491
00:25:50,403 --> 00:25:51,940
<i>What does that suggest to you?</i>

492
00:25:51,971 --> 00:25:53,252
<i>It suggests that
the real killer</i>

493
00:25:53,283 --> 00:25:54,788
<i>knew what he was doing.</i>

494
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:55,811
<i>You promised us
Charlie Waldo</i>

495
00:25:55,844 --> 00:25:57,219
<i>from the Lydell Lipps case.</i>

496
00:25:57,252 --> 00:25:58,947
<i>What does it say
that he's not here with you?</i>

497
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,804
<i>Charlie Waldo
is busy uncovering...</i>

498
00:26:09,284 --> 00:26:12,900
Welcome to kindergartens
of the rich and famous.

499
00:26:12,931 --> 00:26:15,107
Gaby, Mr. Lion needs to
talk to your teacher.

500
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,700
But first, he's going to
park this beast.

501
00:26:17,731 --> 00:26:19,940
Now get out, little blighter.

502
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,068
Baby back ribs in there.

503
00:26:27,395 --> 00:26:29,540
Alas, poor Yorick!

504
00:26:29,572 --> 00:26:31,524
I knew him, my sweet Gaby,

505
00:26:31,556 --> 00:26:35,171
a fellow of infinite jest,
of most excellent fancy.

506
00:26:35,204 --> 00:26:37,795
He hath borne me on his back
a thousand times,

507
00:26:37,828 --> 00:26:40,132
and now, how abhorred
in my imagination it is!

508
00:26:40,164 --> 00:26:41,891
My gorge rises at it.

509
00:26:41,924 --> 00:26:44,740
Yes, you're a shadow
of your former self.

510
00:26:44,771 --> 00:26:46,212
It's that keto diet I'm on.

511
00:26:46,244 --> 00:26:48,996
I'm starving. I think I may have
taken it a bit too far.

512
00:26:49,028 --> 00:26:50,340
You got anything in your lunch?

513
00:26:50,371 --> 00:26:52,547
Like a pork chop?
Ham sandwich? No?

514
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,700
I'm afraid it
wouldn't do you any good,

515
00:26:53,732 --> 00:26:55,524
dear boy.
I think you're dead.

516
00:26:55,556 --> 00:26:57,251
Dead? That's tragic.

517
00:26:57,284 --> 00:27:00,387
Yes, indeed, it's tragic.

518
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,211
Where be your gibes now?

519
00:27:02,244 --> 00:27:04,771
Your gambols? Your songs?

520
00:27:04,804 --> 00:27:06,084
Your flashes of merriment

521
00:27:06,116 --> 00:27:09,092
that were wont to set the table
on a roar?

522
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,484
I think
I've soiled my britches.

523
00:27:12,515 --> 00:27:15,395
Should I change my nappy?
Oh, it's all squishy.

524
00:27:15,428 --> 00:27:17,315
Bravo!

525
00:27:17,348 --> 00:27:18,627
Oh, yes, thank you, thank you.

526
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,291
That was funny, Daddy.

527
00:27:20,324 --> 00:27:23,460
Yes. That speech
always slays them.

528
00:27:23,492 --> 00:27:25,539
Come. Let's play on the swings.

529
00:27:25,573 --> 00:27:27,971
I believe Mr. Lion
wants to ask Miss White

530
00:27:28,004 --> 00:27:30,212
whether Daddy plays nicely with
the other children.

531
00:27:30,243 --> 00:27:31,907
Off we go.
Let's get to the swings.

532
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:34,820
- It'll be a swinging time.
- Swing, swing, swing!

533
00:27:34,851 --> 00:27:37,348
My name's Waldo.

534
00:27:37,379 --> 00:27:39,331
I'm a detective
working for Alastair.

535
00:27:39,364 --> 00:27:42,436
Jayne.
My heart breaks for Gaby.

536
00:27:42,467 --> 00:27:46,244
Mr. Pinch is doing a lot
to keep her spirits up.

537
00:27:46,276 --> 00:27:49,251
And Mrs. Pinch...
What was she like as a parent?

538
00:27:51,811 --> 00:27:54,243
Mrs. Pinch?

539
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:59,108
We have the children memorize
these poems.

540
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:03,299
I like to ask the kids whose mom
and dad can recite them too.

541
00:28:03,331 --> 00:28:04,707
Half the time
these parents can't,

542
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,612
but the nanny can
in two languages.

543
00:28:08,643 --> 00:28:10,660
What about the Pinches?

544
00:28:10,693 --> 00:28:12,291
Mrs. Pinch never knew them.

545
00:28:12,324 --> 00:28:15,971
Mr. Pinch, always.

546
00:28:16,004 --> 00:28:18,659
That's unusual.

547
00:28:18,691 --> 00:28:20,931
The death must have shocked
the hell out of this place, huh?

548
00:28:22,724 --> 00:28:24,419
Not me.

549
00:28:27,428 --> 00:28:28,707
Good morning, kids.

550
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,204
Okay, everyone find their place.
Get your bunnies.

551
00:28:31,235 --> 00:28:32,995
We're gonna start by writing
your names on the back of them,

552
00:28:33,028 --> 00:28:35,011
so have a marker.

553
00:28:35,044 --> 00:28:38,403
Miss White, I'm gonna need
to talk to you again.

554
00:28:38,437 --> 00:28:39,875
Sure.

555
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,708
Does everyone have their bunny
from yesterday?

556
00:28:48,164 --> 00:28:50,852
Come meet me tonight.
We can talk then.

557
00:28:52,868 --> 00:28:55,204
All right.
Have you got names set?

558
00:28:55,235 --> 00:28:56,740
Yes, Miss White.

559
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:56,067
Do you put your boots
on your chairs at home?

560
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,403
I live in a trailer
with a chicken.

561
00:29:59,811 --> 00:30:02,724
What happened to this "vayse"?

562
00:30:02,756 --> 00:30:05,540
"Vahse."

563
00:30:05,571 --> 00:30:09,124
Ah, yes. Well...

564
00:30:09,155 --> 00:30:11,331
That's the one
she was killed with.

565
00:30:13,284 --> 00:30:14,819
What was that, ceramic?

566
00:30:14,851 --> 00:30:17,124
Earthenware.
Nice vase. I rather miss it.

567
00:30:17,156 --> 00:30:18,915
What about that table?

568
00:30:20,675 --> 00:30:21,956
It's different.

569
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:23,907
Monica was a tinkerer.

570
00:30:23,941 --> 00:30:27,620
No room was ever finished
to her satisfaction.

571
00:30:27,651 --> 00:30:31,491
Mm. And that sculpture.

572
00:30:31,524 --> 00:30:33,059
The Bard?

573
00:30:33,091 --> 00:30:34,693
The sculpture.

574
00:30:34,724 --> 00:30:36,517
This.

575
00:30:38,084 --> 00:30:39,971
Ah, dear boy.

576
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:44,101
That's a Regis Award
for my Richard III.

577
00:30:44,132 --> 00:30:45,604
Did you move it?

578
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:48,836
I've never been much
for acting trophies.

579
00:30:48,868 --> 00:30:51,748
Monica had that one on display
for sentimental reasons.

580
00:30:51,781 --> 00:30:53,475
That was the production
on which we met.

581
00:30:53,507 --> 00:30:55,075
Really?

582
00:30:55,108 --> 00:30:57,955
Perhaps it's wherever Monica
put my other Regises

583
00:30:57,988 --> 00:31:02,276
or my... People's Choice Award.

584
00:31:03,811 --> 00:31:05,635
Good night, sweet prince.

585
00:31:05,668 --> 00:31:08,132
Flights of angels
sing thee to thy rest.

00:31:17,348 --> 00:31:21,059

592

There goes the good girl
kindergarten teacher.

593
00:31:46,083 --> 00:31:50,115
Just wait till I have
a few Maker's in me.

594
00:31:50,147 --> 00:31:53,156
So why weren't you shocked
that Monica Pinch was killed?

595
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:04,228
Okay, Mr. Waldo.

596
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:06,275
I have a confession.

597
00:32:06,308 --> 00:32:09,219
Okay.

598
00:32:09,251 --> 00:32:11,108
I've been watching
all this TV coverage

599
00:32:11,139 --> 00:32:12,356
since the murder.

600
00:32:15,492 --> 00:32:16,995
I knew exactly who you were

601
00:32:17,027 --> 00:32:19,011
the minute you walked into
my classroom.

602
00:32:19,045 --> 00:32:21,443
That figures.

603
00:32:26,371 --> 00:32:28,291
Who was Lydell Lipps?

604
00:32:28,323 --> 00:32:31,652
Everyone keeps talking
about Lydell Lipps.

605
00:32:38,212 --> 00:32:40,357
I can usually tell when
someone's messing with me.

606
00:32:40,388 --> 00:32:43,045
You're jamming up my radar.

607
00:32:43,076 --> 00:32:45,603
Maybe your radar's just rusty.

608
00:32:48,068 --> 00:32:49,765
Yeah, maybe.

609
00:32:50,084 --> 00:32:52,228
Here you go.

610
00:32:52,259 --> 00:32:53,892
Thanks.

611
00:32:58,628 --> 00:33:00,260
To whiskey and good hair.

612
00:33:13,028 --> 00:33:14,660
It's been a while.

613
00:33:24,227 --> 00:33:26,147
Okay. If you want to know,
I'll tell you.

614
00:33:32,196 --> 00:33:36,483
11 years ago,
there was a robbery at 7-11.

615
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:39,908
The girl behind the counter
and two customers

616
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,251
got shot dead.

617
00:33:41,283 --> 00:33:45,059
I turned up a kid
named Donny Lipps.

618
00:33:45,091 --> 00:33:46,372
Leaned on him pretty hard.

619
00:33:46,405 --> 00:33:47,875
It paid off.

620
00:33:47,907 --> 00:33:50,115
He said he was waiting
in the car outside.

621
00:33:50,148 --> 00:33:52,068
And in return for a deal,

622
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,372
he would give me the shooter.

623
00:33:54,404 --> 00:33:57,988
Turns out that was Lydell,
his brother.

624
00:33:58,021 --> 00:34:00,805
Signed, sealed.

625
00:34:00,836 --> 00:34:02,499
My career's off to the races,
right,

626
00:34:02,531 --> 00:34:05,315
and I am on fire with ambition.

627
00:34:05,348 --> 00:34:07,492
Everything's going great.

628
00:34:07,525 --> 00:34:09,732
Cut to years later.

629
00:34:09,764 --> 00:34:11,556
Lydell comes up for parole,

630
00:34:11,588 --> 00:34:14,468
and the prosecutors ask me to
help them prep for the hearing.

631
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,165
So I go see the brother again,

632
00:34:16,196 --> 00:34:17,859
who's in prison himself
at this point.

633
00:34:17,891 --> 00:34:19,748
Three strikes, unrelated.

634
00:34:21,635 --> 00:34:27,556
Only now he tells me that
the original story was bullshit.

635
00:34:27,588 --> 00:34:31,299
He made it up
to get me off his back.

636
00:34:35,204 --> 00:34:36,612
So at that point,

637
00:34:36,644 --> 00:34:38,341
Lydell had been in jail for...

638
00:34:38,372 --> 00:34:42,020
7 years, 3 months, and 16 days.

639
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:46,595
Well, next thing I learn,

640
00:34:46,628 --> 00:34:49,892
it is a lot harder to get
an innocent man out of jail

641
00:34:49,924 --> 00:34:52,451
than to put a guilty man in.

642
00:34:52,484 --> 00:34:54,852
System isn't designed
to deal with mistakes.

643
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:58,019
And some individuals aren't,
either.

644
00:34:59,907 --> 00:35:01,540
But I keep pushing.

645
00:35:01,572 --> 00:35:03,044
And I keep pushing

646
00:35:03,076 --> 00:35:04,356
and I keep pushing,

647
00:35:04,388 --> 00:35:08,036
and I'm doing everything I can.

648
00:35:08,068 --> 00:35:09,956
And this goes on for a year.

649
00:35:13,508 --> 00:35:16,900
And then Lydell got stabbed

650
00:35:16,932 --> 00:35:20,420
in a yard fight
and he bled to death.

651
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:22,692
After spending every day
of his adult life

652
00:35:22,724 --> 00:35:25,412
locked up for something
that he didn't fucking do.

653
00:35:25,444 --> 00:35:28,228
And that I

654
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,627
built a career on.

655
00:35:37,732 --> 00:35:40,580
And when I run out of people
that would listen,

656
00:35:40,612 --> 00:35:42,340
which took about six months...

657
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,556
Um...

658
00:35:47,588 --> 00:35:49,380
I quit.

659
00:35:49,412 --> 00:35:52,132
And I started talking
to anyone with a microphone.

660
00:35:54,116 --> 00:35:56,900
I guess that would have
burned a lot of bridges.

661
00:35:56,932 --> 00:35:58,820
Oh, I burned the fucking river.

662
00:36:06,179 --> 00:36:08,131
You still haven't told me.

663
00:36:08,163 --> 00:36:10,532
What?

664
00:36:10,564 --> 00:36:13,444
Why weren't you shocked
about Monica Pinch?

665
00:36:13,476 --> 00:36:16,004
Oh, of course I was shocked.

666
00:36:16,036 --> 00:36:19,683
I mean, how could I
not be shocked?

667
00:36:19,715 --> 00:36:21,732
I don't follow.

668
00:36:21,764 --> 00:36:25,988
Waldo,

669
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:28,740
can't you tell when a girl just
wants to have a drink with you?

670
00:36:49,092 --> 00:36:51,235
I said a drink.

671
00:36:55,844 --> 00:36:58,404
Three years in the woods.

672
00:36:58,436 --> 00:37:00,899
You haven't been
with anybody all that time?

673
00:37:03,492 --> 00:37:05,124
No.

674
00:37:08,676 --> 00:37:11,972
That's kind of hot, Waldo.

675
00:37:29,731 --> 00:37:30,691
- Alastair.
- Ah.

676
00:37:30,724 --> 00:37:31,684
They're gonna arrest you.

677
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:32,740
Those are news helicopters.

678
00:37:32,772 --> 00:37:34,788
LAPD's putting on a show.

679
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,772
- Go put some clothes on.
- Don't be silly, love.

680
00:37:36,804 --> 00:37:40,452
The network will adore me
in this wardrobe.

681
00:37:40,484 --> 00:37:43,075
Anyway, if it's good enough
for Wacko Jacko,

682
00:37:43,107 --> 00:37:44,388
it's good enough for me.

683
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,636
Beautiful.

684
00:37:45,668 --> 00:37:47,268
Tits and teeth.

685
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,867
Fuck.

686
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:50,436
- Hold your fire.
- Morning.

687
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:51,492
Alastair Pinch,
you're under arrest

688
00:37:51,524 --> 00:37:53,028
for the murder of Monica Pinch.

689
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:55,204
Come on, Pete.
Do we have to do it like this?

690
00:37:55,236 --> 00:37:56,932
Let him come in
and surrender himself.

691
00:37:56,964 --> 00:37:59,012
- Hands behind your back.
- Really? You're gonna cuff him?

692
00:37:59,044 --> 00:38:00,580
You can't do me a solid
for old times?

693
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:02,020
Fuck you, old times.

694
00:38:02,052 --> 00:38:04,452
You made 10,000 good cops
look like the fucking Klan.

695
00:38:04,484 --> 00:38:06,436
Say goodbye to
your pretty house, huh, Olivier?

696
00:38:06,468 --> 00:38:07,588
Last time you're gonna see it.

697
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,380
Daddy?

698
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:11,588
Daddy's just going for
a sleepover.

699
00:38:11,619 --> 00:38:12,996
Be a good girl.
See you tomorrow.

700
00:38:13,028 --> 00:38:14,052
Come on. Let's go.

701
00:38:33,091 --> 00:38:35,907
Hey!

702
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:40,132
Excuse me. Excuse me.

703
00:38:48,996 --> 00:38:50,404
Did he get bail?

704
00:38:50,436 --> 00:38:52,708
$20 million.

705
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,756
Don't be silly.
We're paying the bail.

706
00:38:54,788 --> 00:38:56,100
It's only $20 million.
I'm insured for it.

707
00:38:56,131 --> 00:38:57,252
- I got to talk to you.
- Hold on.

708
00:38:57,284 --> 00:38:58,500
- I g...
- And that's the end of it.

709
00:38:58,532 --> 00:39:01,156
- So yeah.
- I spoke to my guy at LAPD.

710
00:39:01,187 --> 00:39:03,300
He's why they turned it
into a festival.

711
00:39:03,332 --> 00:39:05,188
You have to get rid of him.

712
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,852
Look, I'm happy to quit.

713
00:39:06,884 --> 00:39:08,772
I don't want to make
this worse for anybody.

714
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:10,692
Worse? You're making it better.

715
00:39:10,724 --> 00:39:12,068
Listen, does one of you guys
have the time?

716
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:13,892
Apparently I have Charlie Sheen
in my office.

717
00:39:13,924 --> 00:39:15,748
How is he making it better?

718
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,412
The bigger assholes
the cops are,

719
00:39:17,444 --> 00:39:19,364
the more sympathy
for our protagonist.

720
00:39:19,396 --> 00:39:21,444
Cheer up, Waldo.
You can't win them all.

721
00:39:21,476 --> 00:39:23,332
Yeah. Yeah. Be right there.

722
00:39:24,388 --> 00:39:26,020
Asshole.

723
00:39:47,971 --> 00:39:50,308
Jesus, Waldo.

724
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,972
Oh, boy.

725
00:39:52,004 --> 00:39:53,379
You don't know me anymore,
you understand?

726
00:39:53,412 --> 00:39:55,812
- You're poison.
- Good to see you too, Freddie.

727
00:39:55,844 --> 00:39:57,508
You been to division yet?

728
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,491
Unh-unh. Probably 20 guys
in that building

729
00:39:59,524 --> 00:40:00,804
like to knock my teeth out.

730
00:40:00,836 --> 00:40:02,660
Twenty?
A hundred!

731
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:05,796
Twenty would like to
shoot them out with a bullet.

732
00:40:07,268 --> 00:40:09,444
I want the autopsy protocol
on Monica Pinch.

733
00:40:09,476 --> 00:40:11,236
All the slides, all the photos.

734
00:40:11,267 --> 00:40:14,147
Yeah, good luck with that.

735
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:16,036
They indict, defense has
the right to everything.

736
00:40:16,067 --> 00:40:18,724
So you can deal with me

737
00:40:18,756 --> 00:40:20,196
or you can deal with
Fontella Davis,

738
00:40:20,228 --> 00:40:22,564
who's every bit the delight
she seems on TV

739
00:40:22,596 --> 00:40:24,996
and who, by the way,
never got you Laker tickets

740
00:40:25,028 --> 00:40:27,491
or lied to your wife
to cover for you.

741
00:40:29,859 --> 00:40:32,164
Charlie fucking Waldo.

742
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:34,180
Jesus.

743
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,700
Straight up, Freddy...
how'd you make this?

744
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:43,780
Cerebral hemorrhage.
Severe blow in the right temple,

745
00:40:43,811 --> 00:40:44,900
second contusion
back of the head,

746
00:40:44,932 --> 00:40:46,500
probably from where she fell.

747
00:40:46,531 --> 00:40:48,068
Victim was found locked
in a house with a drunk

748
00:40:48,099 --> 00:40:49,571
with two assault convictions
in England.

749
00:40:49,604 --> 00:40:52,356
So I'm guessing suicide.

750
00:40:52,388 --> 00:40:54,115
And the alarm,
you know about that, right?

751
00:40:54,148 --> 00:40:55,748
Turns out the alarm company
has it being on

752
00:40:55,779 --> 00:40:57,380
since the previous night.

753
00:40:57,412 --> 00:40:59,044
Before or after time of death?

754
00:40:59,076 --> 00:41:00,388
Too close to call.

755
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:03,844
Guy clobbered his wife
to death with a vase.

756
00:41:03,876 --> 00:41:05,316
That simple.

757
00:41:16,356 --> 00:41:17,540
Hello?

758
00:41:17,572 --> 00:41:19,588
I know who killed
Monica Pinch.

759
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:23,011
Who is this?

760
00:41:23,044 --> 00:41:25,284
Meet me at that rock pile
you live at, Waldo.

761
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,788
I'm not there. I'm in L.A.

762
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,675
Your piece-of-shit trailer. Now.

763
00:41:28,708 --> 00:41:30,947
Nini, is that a croissant?
Give me one of those.

764
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:06,692
Nini, check underneath there.

765
00:42:06,723 --> 00:42:08,739
Nothing? Anything?

766
00:42:08,772 --> 00:42:12,900
Open this shit up.

767
00:42:12,931 --> 00:42:15,428
This a Kindle?

768
00:42:15,459 --> 00:42:17,635
How you like it so far?

769
00:42:17,668 --> 00:42:21,508
I'm trying to decide
between this and the Nook.

770
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,756
Nook's a little cheaper.

771
00:42:22,787 --> 00:42:25,028
I like the Kindle
for content.

772
00:42:25,059 --> 00:42:27,235
Content. Right.
How's their tech support?

773
00:42:27,268 --> 00:42:28,932
Keep looking.

774
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:30,308
Pretty good.

775
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:32,195
Out of 10,
what would you give it?

776
00:42:32,228 --> 00:42:34,436
- 8.
- 8. Fucking...

777
00:42:46,691 --> 00:42:47,907
I'm Don Q.

778
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:51,556
You heard of me?

779
00:42:51,587 --> 00:42:53,476
This man is Nini.

780
00:42:53,507 --> 00:42:55,716
Do not fuck with this man.

781
00:42:55,748 --> 00:42:58,307
He was number-one ranked
Inuit light heavyweight.

782
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:00,548
Nini, squeeze me.

783
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:02,116
- Inuit?
- Yeah.

784
00:43:02,147 --> 00:43:04,227
Is that like Eskimo?

785
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:09,700
No. No, see,

786
00:43:09,731 --> 00:43:12,740
Nini, here,
he's from Canada.

787
00:43:12,771 --> 00:43:14,468
You can say Eskimo in Alaska,

788
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:17,155
but in Canada,
they prefer to be called Inuit.

789
00:43:17,188 --> 00:43:19,204
To them, Eskimo is
considered pejorative.

790
00:43:19,235 --> 00:43:21,476
You need to be careful
with chicken.

791
00:43:27,363 --> 00:43:29,828
- There he goes.
- Oh, wow.

792
00:43:31,715 --> 00:43:32,836
That was fucking good.

793
00:43:32,867 --> 00:43:34,052
Yeah, of course.

794
00:43:34,083 --> 00:43:36,419
That ain't the reason
for our visit.

795
00:43:36,451 --> 00:43:37,636
Where is it?

796
00:43:37,667 --> 00:43:39,364
Where is what?

797
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:42,692
The mem that Lorena
left with you.

798
00:43:45,316 --> 00:43:48,196
Where is it, Waldo? Huh?

799
00:43:48,227 --> 00:43:50,180
I'm starting to think
you're not here

800
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:52,227
to tell me who killed
Monica Pinch.

801
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,820
So you are a detective.

802
00:43:54,851 --> 00:43:56,836
Where are all your possessions?

803
00:43:58,724 --> 00:44:00,580
I'm a minimalist.

804
00:44:00,611 --> 00:44:01,956
What's that,
like the... the artists

805
00:44:01,987 --> 00:44:04,676
with the white on white
and shit?

806
00:44:04,707 --> 00:44:08,516
It's more like a lifestyle.

807
00:44:08,547 --> 00:44:10,563
I only have 100 things.

808
00:44:13,955 --> 00:44:15,811
100 things.

809
00:44:15,844 --> 00:44:19,333
Well, 99 now.

810
00:44:19,364 --> 00:44:22,116
That's fucked up, bro, though.

811
00:44:22,148 --> 00:44:25,667
Especially if one of them
is mine.

812
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:30,211
You got 24 hours,
and then I want my mem.

813
00:44:30,244 --> 00:44:31,556
What's a mem?

814
00:44:31,587 --> 00:44:34,115
Call my boy here
when you got it in hand.

815
00:44:34,148 --> 00:44:37,573
818-OH-NANOOK.

816
00:44:37,604 --> 00:44:40,131
The alternative...

817
00:44:41,924 --> 00:44:43,875
Maybe you end up like Lorena.

818
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:47,972
Where is she?

819
00:44:48,003 --> 00:44:49,411
Nini, let's go.

820
00:44:49,444 --> 00:44:52,291
Hey, fuckface!

821
00:44:52,324 --> 00:44:54,179
I don't think
I look like a fuckface.

822
00:44:54,211 --> 00:44:56,035
If anything,
he looks like a fuckface.

823
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:57,572
I mean, what does
a fuckface look like?

824
00:44:57,603 --> 00:44:58,563
I don't know.

825
00:45:38,756 --> 00:45:40,355
This doesn't make sense.

826
00:45:46,628 --> 00:45:48,131
Back to 100.

827
00:46:01,571 --> 00:46:04,676
Yeah. That's right.

828
00:46:12,995 --> 00:46:15,171
Charlie Waldo.
This is what I want.

829
00:46:15,204 --> 00:46:17,891
One, everyone who was on
crime scene security.

830
00:46:17,924 --> 00:46:20,675
Two, all transport, medical,
and emergency personnel

831
00:46:20,708 --> 00:46:22,851
who had contact
with the victim and the suspect.

832
00:46:22,884 --> 00:46:24,579
Don't talk to him.
Nobody gives him anything.

833
00:46:24,611 --> 00:46:26,435
He's a rat.
Nothing to see here.

834
00:46:26,468 --> 00:46:27,844
Show's over.
Let's go back to work.

835
00:46:27,877 --> 00:46:29,475
All right.
How about first to respond?

836
00:46:29,507 --> 00:46:31,813
I'll start there.

837
00:46:31,844 --> 00:46:33,347
- Huh?
- Don't talk to him.

838
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:35,300
Nobody talks to him.
He's not here, all right?

839
00:46:35,331 --> 00:46:37,795
You ignored him, understand?
Understood?

840
00:46:37,828 --> 00:46:39,140
You do what I say, not him.

841
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:41,317
You.

842
00:46:41,348 --> 00:46:43,011
Officer...

843
00:46:43,044 --> 00:46:45,220
Anus?

844
00:46:45,253 --> 00:46:46,628
Annis.

845
00:46:46,659 --> 00:46:47,844
High school must have sucked.

846
00:46:47,876 --> 00:46:49,444
Do not speak to him, Annis.

847
00:46:49,475 --> 00:46:51,395
You were at the Pinch house?
You the first ones,

848
00:46:51,428 --> 00:46:52,900
- you and your partner?
- Annis...

849
00:46:52,933 --> 00:46:55,299
Do you know who
Fontella Davis is?

850
00:46:55,331 --> 00:46:56,740
- Ignore him.
- Do you want her

851
00:46:56,773 --> 00:46:58,051
on TV every night
making this case about you?

852
00:46:58,084 --> 00:47:00,004
- Show's over.
- When you arrived

853
00:47:00,035 --> 00:47:02,276
at the house,
was the door dead-bolted?

854
00:47:02,308 --> 00:47:04,100
You sure? It's frosted glass.

855
00:47:04,131 --> 00:47:06,308
You couldn't see him unlock it.
You heard it that clearly?

856
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:07,651
The alarm was on.
We saw him disarm it.

857
00:47:07,684 --> 00:47:09,220
- What did I say?
- Yes, Anus,

858
00:47:09,253 --> 00:47:11,972
but the real killer could have
set the alarm on the way out

859
00:47:12,004 --> 00:47:13,700
- if the door wasn't dead-bolted.
- He's just talking in circles.

860
00:47:13,731 --> 00:47:14,884
What about
the murder weapon?

861
00:47:14,917 --> 00:47:15,973
It's all bullshit.

862
00:47:16,004 --> 00:47:17,668
The earthenware vase.

863
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:19,395
It wasn't you that gathered up
all the pieces, was it?

864
00:47:19,427 --> 00:47:22,179
Do not fucking answer him,
all right?

865
00:47:22,211 --> 00:47:23,971
Yes, Waldo, he got all
the pieces of the murder weapon.

866
00:47:24,004 --> 00:47:25,540
- I supervised it myself.
- The earthenware vase.

867
00:47:25,573 --> 00:47:27,044
The earthenware vase.

868
00:47:27,075 --> 00:47:29,348
Only the earthenware vase
isn't the murder weapon.

869
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:31,748
Not if Alastair Pinch
killed her.

870
00:47:31,779 --> 00:47:33,188
That thing's got to weigh
28 pounds.

871
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:35,715
It came down
over the victim's right eye.

872
00:47:35,747 --> 00:47:37,731
You'd have to be pretty strong a
lefty to make a shot like that,

873
00:47:37,764 --> 00:47:39,235
not a drunken righty.

874
00:47:39,268 --> 00:47:40,515
Almost convincing.

875
00:47:40,547 --> 00:47:42,148
Pinch is a righty.
I've watched him pour.

876
00:47:42,179 --> 00:47:44,355
Officer Annis,
could I have a moment?

877
00:47:46,148 --> 00:47:48,131
You see that statue?

878
00:47:48,164 --> 00:47:49,859
That's a Regis Award
for acting in England.

879
00:47:49,891 --> 00:47:52,196
You ever seen it before?

880
00:47:52,228 --> 00:47:54,181
That's 'cause it's missing.
That's the murder weapon.

881
00:47:54,212 --> 00:47:56,132
- Oh, please. Time to go home.
- Three and a half pounds.

882
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:58,563
The earthenware vase, the victim
hit that on the way down.

883
00:47:58,595 --> 00:48:00,388
- Annis.
- Hey, don't look at him.

884
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:02,371
The department's gonna
let you get fucked on this.

885
00:48:02,403 --> 00:48:03,748
- Believe me, I know.
- That's it, Waldo.

886
00:48:03,781 --> 00:48:04,837
I'm gonna give you 10 seconds,
how about that?

887
00:48:04,868 --> 00:48:06,179
- 10 seconds?
- Yeah.

888
00:48:06,211 --> 00:48:07,491
- Perfect. That's all I need.
- 9.

889
00:48:07,525 --> 00:48:08,995
Annis, you don't want
to be the guy

890
00:48:09,028 --> 00:48:10,179
who puts away an innocent man,
believe me.

891
00:48:10,211 --> 00:48:11,875
- Let's... Come on.
- You may as well

892
00:48:11,908 --> 00:48:13,059
pull down your pants,
'cause you're gonna get fucked.

893
00:48:13,091 --> 00:48:14,468
- Come on.
- You're gonna get fucked, Annis.

894
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,675
It sounded like he fumbled
with the dead-bolt...

895
00:48:16,708 --> 00:48:18,181
- What did I tell you?!
- He was still drunk.

896
00:48:18,212 --> 00:48:19,588
We couldn't tell for sure.

897
00:48:19,619 --> 00:48:21,731
Shut the fuck up, Anus.

898
00:48:21,764 --> 00:48:23,780
Nobody talks to this scum sack.

899
00:48:23,812 --> 00:48:25,861
This man is not a cop.
He is not one of us.

900
00:48:25,892 --> 00:48:27,491
He's a fucking rat.

901
00:48:27,524 --> 00:48:30,757
He's a person of interest
in a homicide investigation.

902
00:48:30,788 --> 00:48:33,188
For those of you
that don't know,

903
00:48:33,219 --> 00:48:37,923
the body of one adult female

904
00:48:37,955 --> 00:48:41,348
ID'd as Lorena Nascimento.

905
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:43,972
Yeah, she borrowed
her husband's Porsche.

906
00:48:44,005 --> 00:48:45,988
She didn't tell you about him,
did she?

907
00:48:46,021 --> 00:48:47,684
We found it on fire
off the freeway,

908
00:48:47,715 --> 00:48:49,667
up by Magic Mountain.

909
00:48:49,699 --> 00:48:53,348
Fully engulfed, body inside.

910
00:48:53,379 --> 00:48:55,299
That item she gave you,

911
00:48:55,331 --> 00:48:57,188
that could put Don Q away
for so long

912
00:48:57,219 --> 00:49:00,292
you'll both die
of natural causes.

913
00:49:00,325 --> 00:49:03,428
Why don't you just
give it to me?

914
00:49:04,452 --> 00:49:06,085
I tried to warn you.

915
00:49:23,075 --> 00:49:24,388
What the fuck?

916
00:49:34,948 --> 00:49:36,036
Fuck you!

917
00:49:36,068 --> 00:49:37,411
Fuck you!

918
00:49:37,443 --> 00:49:38,852
Fuck you!

919
00:49:49,028 --> 00:49:50,755
Killed her!

920
00:49:52,196 --> 00:49:55,045
They fucking killed her!

921
00:50:17,444 --> 00:50:18,948
I, uh...

922
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:21,028
I had my bike on this rack.

923
00:50:21,061 --> 00:50:23,395
I think I left my lock.

924
00:50:23,427 --> 00:50:25,539
Following me all day.

925
00:50:25,571 --> 00:50:27,363
Who the fuck are you?

926
00:50:27,395 --> 00:50:31,331
An attorney. I'm an attorney
specializing in personal injury.

927
00:50:31,364 --> 00:50:33,155
And if you do not unhand me,

928
00:50:33,188 --> 00:50:34,947
I will sue damages.

929
00:50:34,979 --> 00:50:37,028
Please?

930
00:50:37,059 --> 00:50:40,036
That's fine.

931
00:50:40,068 --> 00:50:43,940
That's fine.

932
00:50:43,972 --> 00:50:45,603
You're a private eye?

933
00:50:45,635 --> 00:50:47,972
Yeah. I'm a private eye.

934
00:50:48,004 --> 00:50:49,700
Who the fuck are you?

935
00:50:49,732 --> 00:50:52,195
You, sir,
just committed a felony,

936
00:50:52,227 --> 00:50:54,115
presenting yourself as a PI
in the state of California

937
00:50:54,147 --> 00:50:56,995
when you are, in fact,
unlicensed.

938
00:50:57,027 --> 00:50:58,308
Now, I will level with you.

939
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:01,572
I have a client
who cannot understand

940
00:51:01,604 --> 00:51:04,388
why you would associate yourself
with a murderer

941
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:06,148
like Alastair Pinch.

942
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:17,219
Beautiful watch.

943
00:51:24,388 --> 00:51:26,276
Who's the client?

944
00:51:26,308 --> 00:51:27,715
Listen.

945
00:51:27,747 --> 00:51:29,060
Asshole.

946
00:51:29,092 --> 00:51:32,547
I'm not gonna let you
wrestle me off this case.

947
00:51:32,579 --> 00:51:34,852
- No, no, Mr. Waldo.
- Let's just communicate.

948
00:51:34,885 --> 00:51:37,604
There has been no threat
from me, nor do I intend one.

949
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:40,355
- I apologize.
- I am going to fucking kill you.

950
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:43,075
No, sir, listen.
It is my hope and my client's

951
00:51:43,107 --> 00:51:46,532
that this pleasant, okay,
happenstantial meeting

952
00:51:46,564 --> 00:51:48,035
between the last two of us

953
00:51:48,068 --> 00:51:49,252
is the last time you and I
see each other.

954
00:51:49,285 --> 00:51:52,835
So with that in mind, excuse me.

955
00:51:52,868 --> 00:51:55,076
Sir, please.

956
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:58,980
I'll take my things.

957
00:52:00,836 --> 00:52:04,452
You know, actually,
on second thought,

958
00:52:04,484 --> 00:52:09,284
neither one of these
are my bike.

959
00:52:09,316 --> 00:52:10,468
Good day.

960
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:25,475
Yeah, thanks for the phone,
you fucking ambulance chaser.

961
00:52:29,732 --> 00:52:34,979
Warren Gomes, Esquire.

962
00:52:35,011 --> 00:52:36,835
Warren Gomes.

963
00:52:36,867 --> 00:52:39,076
The last call was to...

964
00:52:39,108 --> 00:52:40,803
Darius Jamshidi.

965
00:52:40,836 --> 00:52:43,332
Darius Jamshidi.

966
00:52:43,364 --> 00:52:45,924
Darius Jamshidi.

967
00:52:48,836 --> 00:52:51,331
Huh.

968
00:52:51,363 --> 00:52:55,780
Where do we live,
Darius Jamshidi?

969
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:06,852
Jamshidi.

970
00:53:06,884 --> 00:53:08,772
You're not gonna wrestle me
off this case.

971
00:53:08,804 --> 00:53:10,531
Asshole.

972
00:53:10,564 --> 00:53:12,484
Fuck this.

973
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:21,988
You ghosted me, Waldo.

974
00:54:49,059 --> 00:54:52,676
I'm looking for Darius Jamshidi!

975
00:55:01,187 --> 00:55:03,972
Come on. Who's gonna help me?

976
00:55:04,004 --> 00:55:06,852
You gonna help me?

977
00:55:06,884 --> 00:55:12,484
I spy with my little eye

978
00:55:12,516 --> 00:55:13,604
Darius Jamshidi.

979
00:55:16,452 --> 00:55:17,796
No?

980
00:55:17,828 --> 00:55:19,108
You look like a Darius.

981
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:20,324
All right.
That's enough.

982
00:55:20,356 --> 00:55:21,347
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

983
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:23,396
Oh, yeah? Really?

984
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:26,980
Hey, hey, hey. Don't look at me.

985
00:55:27,012 --> 00:55:28,260
He attacked me.

986
00:55:28,292 --> 00:55:29,764
- I'm just...
- That's enough, friend.

987
00:55:29,796 --> 00:55:31,748
Okay, fellas,
it's two against one.

988
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:35,460
Come on. Where's your sense
of sportsmanship?

989
00:55:36,932 --> 00:55:38,724
Stop!

990
00:55:38,756 --> 00:55:41,796
Be cool.

991
00:55:41,828 --> 00:55:44,260
He needs to take those handcuffs
off his belt

992
00:55:44,292 --> 00:55:48,260
and handcuff one of his wrists,
okay?

993
00:55:48,292 --> 00:55:50,884
- Tell him.
- Do it.

994
00:55:53,956 --> 00:55:55,172
Knee.

995
00:55:55,203 --> 00:55:58,212
Okay. Hey, hey, hey. Steady.

996
00:55:58,244 --> 00:56:01,796
Now, I have an idea, and I don't
want you to panic, okay?

997
00:56:01,828 --> 00:56:03,428
Just go with me.

998
00:56:06,788 --> 00:56:09,060
Okay.

999
00:56:09,091 --> 00:56:11,332
Whew.
All right.

1000
00:56:11,364 --> 00:56:13,124
Now...

1001
00:56:13,828 --> 00:56:16,036
...we're gonna take
a little walk.

1002
00:56:16,067 --> 00:56:20,804
And you're gonna introduce me
to Mr. Jamshidi.

1003
00:56:22,724 --> 00:56:25,540
All right. Let's go.
We're walking.

1004
00:56:25,571 --> 00:56:28,228
How about him?

1005
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:29,892
Hm?

1006
00:56:29,924 --> 00:56:31,683
Okay, him?

1007
00:56:31,716 --> 00:56:32,739
Okay.

1008
00:56:32,772 --> 00:56:35,396
How about him, huh?

1009
00:56:35,428 --> 00:56:38,084
I'm Darius Jamshidi.

1010
00:56:38,116 --> 00:56:41,283
The real police will be here
in a few minutes,

1011
00:56:41,316 --> 00:56:44,964
but I'd be happy to
speak with you until then.

1012
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:02,340
I see you're trying to
buy a television network, huh?

1013
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:09,827
This ends with you walking out
that door in a few minutes.

1014
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:12,420
You sic Warren Gomes on me?

1015
00:57:12,451 --> 00:57:14,404
I assume you sent those kids,
too.

1016
00:57:14,436 --> 00:57:16,516
The Palisades Posse.

1017
00:57:16,547 --> 00:57:18,276
Question is,

1018
00:57:18,308 --> 00:57:21,251
why do you want me to stay away
from the Pinch case?

1019
00:57:24,164 --> 00:57:26,180
- I don't know who you are.
- Have you met my wife?

1020
00:57:26,212 --> 00:57:28,323
But you just ruined my benefit.

1021
00:57:28,356 --> 00:57:31,107
And no doubt cost a very,
very important charity

1022
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:33,027
tens of thousands of dollars.

1023
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:34,884
Now, I want you to go release
those two men,

1024
00:57:34,916 --> 00:57:36,867
and I want you to unlock
that one man's ear

1025
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,371
from the other man's backside.

1026
00:57:38,404 --> 00:57:39,716
I'll do that.

1027
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:41,251
My husband will show you
to the tennis courts.

1028
00:57:41,284 --> 00:57:44,452
You'll find those men there
and your chain.

1029
00:57:44,484 --> 00:57:47,076
- Thank you.
- Asshole.

1030
00:57:47,108 --> 00:57:48,900
She seems very nice.

1031
00:57:48,931 --> 00:57:51,204
This has been delightful.

1032
00:57:51,236 --> 00:57:54,628
The wall past the next house
backs out onto Mulholland.

1033
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:55,972
If you'd be so kind

1034
00:57:56,004 --> 00:57:58,947
as to not cause any more drama
in the party.

1035
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:01,475
Tell me who Warren Gomes is.

1036
00:58:01,508 --> 00:58:03,972
Gomes is dead.

1037
00:58:04,004 --> 00:58:05,540
What are you talking about?

1038
00:58:05,572 --> 00:58:07,300
I just spoke with the police.

1039
00:58:07,331 --> 00:58:10,404
Someone shot him
just before you arrived.

1040
00:58:10,436 --> 00:58:14,051
It wasn't you, per chance,
was it?

1041
00:58:14,084 --> 00:58:17,348
Why don't you tell me
what he was doing for you?

1042
00:58:17,379 --> 00:58:24,484
Warren Gomes has... had
a talent for special research,

1043
00:58:24,515 --> 00:58:27,812
which allows my company
to make what it makes.

1044
00:58:27,843 --> 00:58:29,380
Which is?

1045
00:58:29,411 --> 00:58:31,460
Money.

1046
00:58:31,492 --> 00:58:35,427
So Gomes was digging up dirt
to help you buy the network.

1047
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:38,084
Why do you want me to stay away
from Pinch?

1048
00:58:42,052 --> 00:58:43,620
I believe that's for you.

1049
00:59:06,243 --> 00:59:07,299
Waldo.

1050
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:10,628
Waldo.

1051
00:59:29,156 --> 00:59:30,851
Alastair?

1052
00:59:33,827 --> 00:59:35,524
Rosario?

1053
00:59:38,339 --> 00:59:40,195
Alastair?

1054
01:00:45,157 --> 01:00:47,620
Where's Alastair?

1055
01:00:54,788 --> 01:00:56,387
Line.

1056
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:58,019
"I'll recuse myself
if I have to."

1057
01:00:58,051 --> 01:00:59,235
- Shit.
- And cut.

1058
01:00:59,267 --> 01:01:00,517
Excuse me.

1059
01:01:00,548 --> 01:01:02,980
I must have been distracted
by your perfume.

1060
01:01:04,964 --> 01:01:06,659
Things are getting
fucking strange,

1061
01:01:06,691 --> 01:01:08,293
and I need your help.

1062
01:01:08,324 --> 01:01:10,851
Darius Jamshidi.

1063
01:01:10,884 --> 01:01:12,867
That name mean
anything to you?

1064
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:16,515
No, but Robert Blake
called last night

1065
01:01:16,547 --> 01:01:20,164
and asked if I want
to play pinochle on Thursdays.

1066
01:01:20,195 --> 01:01:23,108
You do realize that everyone
is sure you did this.

1067
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:24,420
The only thing giving me doubts

1068
01:01:24,452 --> 01:01:26,211
it's that someone's
busting my horns.

1069
01:01:26,244 --> 01:01:28,035
and me figuring out why

1070
01:01:28,067 --> 01:01:29,860
is the only thing
standing between you

1071
01:01:29,891 --> 01:01:31,044
and a life sentence.

1072
01:01:31,076 --> 01:01:33,668
When I ask for help,
I don't know,

1073
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:35,715
maybe you should fucking help.

1074
01:01:35,747 --> 01:01:38,595
Simmer down.
How could I be of service?

1075
01:01:41,348 --> 01:01:44,228
Is there anything
you're not telling me?

1076
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:45,668
Like what?

1077
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:48,195
Like did you invite someone over
to your house that night?

1078
01:01:48,227 --> 01:01:49,347
- No.
- You sure?

1079
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:51,075
- Absolutely.
- Could you invite someone

1080
01:01:51,107 --> 01:01:52,804
over to the house
and not remember the next day?

1081
01:01:52,835 --> 01:01:54,724
I've gotten married,
fathered children,

1082
01:01:54,755 --> 01:01:58,499
and taken out mortgages
and not remembered the next day.

1083
01:02:03,587 --> 01:02:05,444
When did you move
the furniture around?

1084
01:02:05,475 --> 01:02:06,820
I told you, Monica was
a constant tinkerer.

1085
01:02:06,853 --> 01:02:08,291
She was never finished...

1086
01:02:08,324 --> 01:02:10,211
The night table
in my room doesn't fit.

1087
01:02:10,244 --> 01:02:12,131
I'm thinking someone moved it
from your room

1088
01:02:12,164 --> 01:02:13,795
and the one in your room
from the living room,

1089
01:02:13,828 --> 01:02:15,748
probably on the night
of the murder

1090
01:02:15,779 --> 01:02:17,924
unless you moved it since.

1091
01:02:17,955 --> 01:02:20,739
I have not moved them since.
Piss off.

1092
01:02:31,524 --> 01:02:35,524
What shall you do, Detective,

1093
01:02:35,557 --> 01:02:39,460
if find that I did,
in fact, murder my wife?

1094
01:02:39,493 --> 01:02:41,060
Will you stand for your client

1095
01:02:41,091 --> 01:02:42,595
or... or for truth and justice,

1096
01:02:42,628 --> 01:02:45,604
like the incorruptible
Charlie Waldo of yore?

1097
01:02:50,821 --> 01:02:54,339
You stick with truth
and justice, Waldo.

1098
01:02:54,371 --> 01:02:57,315
If I've killed
my little girl's mother,

1099
01:02:57,347 --> 01:03:00,644
I'll take what's coming to me
and call it even.

1100
01:03:04,357 --> 01:03:05,699
Daddy!

1101
01:03:05,731 --> 01:03:08,835
Ah! There's my darling.

1102
01:03:08,867 --> 01:03:10,659
I know all of my lines
for the play.

1103
01:03:10,691 --> 01:03:13,475
I can't wait to see
your Rumpelstiltskin.

1104
01:03:13,508 --> 01:03:14,724
Come, now.

1105
01:03:14,755 --> 01:03:17,284
Today I brew, tomorrow I bake.

1106
01:03:17,315 --> 01:03:20,355
And then the prince child
I'll take!

1107
01:03:26,372 --> 01:03:27,460
You sound like a maniac.

1108
01:03:27,493 --> 01:03:29,891
Hey, you sober enough to drive?

1109
01:03:29,924 --> 01:03:31,684
I suppose so. Why?

1110
01:03:31,715 --> 01:03:33,157
I'll meet you at your house.

1111
01:03:33,188 --> 01:03:34,916
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

1112
01:03:34,948 --> 01:03:37,092
Just lock the door
and don't answer it.

1113
01:03:39,459 --> 01:03:41,701
Hey! Fuckhead!

1114
01:03:41,732 --> 01:03:43,588
Tell me about Lorena.

1115
01:03:43,621 --> 01:03:45,572
Fuck you.

1116
01:03:45,604 --> 01:03:47,043
How about you tell me
about my mem?

1117
01:03:47,075 --> 01:03:49,187
I don't even know
what a fucking mem is!

1118
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:50,819
Tell me about my mem.

1119
01:03:50,851 --> 01:03:52,131
Who are you people?!

1120
01:03:52,165 --> 01:03:55,076
Cool your jets now.

1121
01:03:55,108 --> 01:03:57,795
I think you're prevaricating,
Waldo.

1122
01:03:57,827 --> 01:03:59,651
She says she gave it to you.

1123
01:03:59,684 --> 01:04:02,020
Last words the bitch ever said,
so I'm inclined to believe her.

1124
01:04:02,052 --> 01:04:03,620
You know she was still alive

1125
01:04:03,651 --> 01:04:05,188
when I poured the gasoline
on her?

1126
01:04:06,852 --> 01:04:08,131
Fucking kill you!

1127
01:04:08,163 --> 01:04:09,541
Fuck!

1128
01:04:09,572 --> 01:04:12,260
You dirty motherfucker.

1129
01:04:17,731 --> 01:04:18,915
Waldo.

1130
01:04:18,947 --> 01:04:20,132
Lorena.

1131
01:04:20,164 --> 01:04:24,132
Waldo, you've just had
a concussion.

1132
01:04:24,164 --> 01:04:26,692
Okay, can you focus?

1133
01:04:28,484 --> 01:04:29,605
Yeah.

1134
01:04:29,636 --> 01:04:30,757
The school nurse went home.

1135
01:04:30,788 --> 01:04:32,420
I said I'd take care of you.

1136
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:36,131
Fuck, is it...

1137
01:04:36,164 --> 01:04:38,212
No, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't confuse you.

1138
01:04:38,245 --> 01:04:40,196
It's 4:30 in the afternoon.

1139
01:04:40,228 --> 01:04:42,085
You've just had a concussion,
and...

1140
01:04:43,683 --> 01:04:45,571
Okay, just go really slowly.

1141
01:04:45,603 --> 01:04:48,132
I'll drop you off at Alastair's.

1142
01:04:51,972 --> 01:04:53,732
Lot of traffic.

1143
01:04:53,764 --> 01:04:55,492
Thanks for taking me home.

1144
01:04:57,251 --> 01:04:59,235
I might have a better idea.

1145
01:05:02,341 --> 01:05:04,771
Do you trust me?

1146
01:05:04,803 --> 01:05:06,915
Why should I trust you?

1147
01:05:06,947 --> 01:05:08,675
Because you'll like it.

1148
01:06:53,892 --> 01:06:57,700
All right.
Well, this is me.

1149
01:06:57,732 --> 01:06:59,171
Have a nice day.

1150
01:06:59,204 --> 01:07:00,325
You too.

1151
01:07:00,356 --> 01:07:04,260
Doing whatever it is
that you do.

1152
01:07:04,292 --> 01:07:05,763
I'm late.

1153
01:07:05,795 --> 01:07:07,619
I'm gonna call you.

1154
01:07:07,651 --> 01:07:09,156
I know you will.

1155
01:07:09,188 --> 01:07:12,451
Mr. Lion, did you find
my invitation?

1156
01:07:12,483 --> 01:07:15,363
What are you gonna do?

1157
01:07:15,395 --> 01:07:16,484
About what?

1158
01:07:16,516 --> 01:07:18,628
Your mane is gone.

1159
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:20,067
Can I tell you a secret?

1160
01:07:20,099 --> 01:07:21,091
Yes.

1161
01:07:21,123 --> 01:07:23,652
It was stolen by a princess.

1162
01:07:23,684 --> 01:07:25,988
I will get back for you, okay?

1163
01:07:26,019 --> 01:07:27,364
- Will you?
- Mm-hmm.

1164
01:07:27,396 --> 01:07:29,763
Thank you.

1165
01:07:29,795 --> 01:07:31,236
You have a good day.

1166
01:07:31,268 --> 01:07:32,932
I will.

1167
01:08:08,708 --> 01:08:10,212
Yes!

1168
01:08:10,244 --> 01:08:11,939
Fuckin' yes!

1169
01:08:13,859 --> 01:08:16,707
Fuckin' yes!
Yes!

1170
01:08:16,739 --> 01:08:18,595
Yes!

1171
01:08:32,708 --> 01:08:35,460
Mem.
Memory stick.

1172
01:08:53,860 --> 01:08:57,572
Nini.
It's your old friend Waldo.

1173
01:08:58,244 --> 01:08:59,875
What, cat got your tongue?

1174
01:09:01,156 --> 01:09:03,076
Tell your boss
he can have his mem.

1175
01:09:03,108 --> 01:09:07,140
Meet me tomorrow...
Wilshire and Catalina, 2:00.

1176
01:09:24,580 --> 01:09:28,675
Young man, could I ask you
to use your earphones, please?

1177
01:09:28,707 --> 01:09:30,308
I mean, those are the rules.

1178
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:35,812
Excuse me.
Who's that you're listening to?

1179
01:09:35,844 --> 01:09:37,444
Oh.
Swag Doggg.

1180
01:09:37,476 --> 01:09:38,468
Swag Doggg?

1181
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:39,460
Yeah.

1182
01:09:39,492 --> 01:09:41,444
All right.
Thank you.

1183
01:09:48,484 --> 01:09:51,044
<i>We got to talk about it.
It's all over social media.</i>

1184
01:09:51,076 --> 01:09:53,028
<i>But you're the first
hip-hop artist we've seen</i>

1185
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:55,044
<i>spell his name D-O-G-G-G.</i>

1186
01:09:55,076 --> 01:09:56,900
<i>What's that about?</i>

1187
01:09:56,932 --> 01:09:59,844
<i>Well, you know that third G
is for the big homie... God.</i>

1188
01:09:59,876 --> 01:10:01,796
- <i>Uh-huh.</i>
- <i>Oh God, baby.</i>

1189
01:10:01,828 --> 01:10:03,908
<i>Immaculate conception.
You feel me?</i>

1190
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:05,796
<i>Immaculate concept
that pink purse</i>

1191
01:10:05,828 --> 01:10:07,620
- <i>from around your neck.</i>
- It's a Bottega.

1192
01:10:07,652 --> 01:10:09,252
<i>That is a purse.</i>

1193
01:10:11,492 --> 01:10:12,867
- <i>I brush every...</i>
- <i>Morning!</i>

1194
01:10:12,899 --> 01:10:14,372
- <i>I brush every...</i>
- <i>Night!</i>

1195
01:10:14,404 --> 01:10:15,972
<i>I brush and I brush
till my teeth, they're...</i>

1196
01:10:16,004 --> 01:10:19,044
- <i>White!</i>
- <i>Aah!</i>

1197
01:10:19,076 --> 01:10:20,259
Lil Doggg.

1198
01:10:20,292 --> 01:10:22,531
Hey, buddy.

1199
01:10:22,564 --> 01:10:24,772
Earphones.
It's rules.

1200
01:10:24,804 --> 01:10:26,564
Sorry.

1201
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:36,612
Hello?

1202
01:10:36,644 --> 01:10:38,404
Waldo?

1203
01:10:40,036 --> 01:10:42,308
Nice of you to call.

1204
01:10:42,339 --> 01:10:43,684
Where the hell are you?

1205
01:10:43,716 --> 01:10:46,500
I can't say.
Listen.

1206
01:10:46,531 --> 01:10:49,059
There's a guy who's gonna
reach out to you hasn't already.

1207
01:10:49,092 --> 01:10:50,884
Oh, he has.

1208
01:10:50,916 --> 01:10:52,676
He's for real.
Don't mess around.

1209
01:10:52,708 --> 01:10:54,340
I know.
Everyone thinks he killed you.

1210
01:10:54,372 --> 01:10:57,028
He can't if he can't find me.

1211
01:11:02,147 --> 01:11:03,972
Hi.

1212
01:11:04,004 --> 01:11:06,820
I'm writing a piece for <i>Esquire</i>
on the new face of hip-hop.

1213
01:11:06,852 --> 01:11:08,259
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

1214
01:11:08,292 --> 01:11:09,636
Sir, are you okay?

1215
01:11:10,724 --> 01:11:12,644
- It's okay.
- It's all right.

1216
01:11:12,676 --> 01:11:13,540
Could I have that, please?

1217
01:11:15,587 --> 01:11:18,596
Back up, Nini.
It's all right. I got this.

1218
01:11:19,556 --> 01:11:20,995
It's pretty fucking bold of you

1219
01:11:21,028 --> 01:11:22,948
to be disrespecting me
like that,

1220
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:26,020
especially in light
of Lorena's final hours.

1221
01:11:26,052 --> 01:11:29,092
You should've seen her fuckin'
eyes when I lit that match, bro.

1222
01:11:29,124 --> 01:11:30,980
She was crying,
snot coming down her nose...

1223
01:11:31,012 --> 01:11:33,156
I just talked to her.

1224
01:11:33,188 --> 01:11:34,179
Now.

1225
01:11:35,172 --> 01:11:37,315
So why don't we cut the bullshit
and you tell me

1226
01:11:37,348 --> 01:11:40,676
why Lorena was messing with you
in the first place.

1227
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:43,812
Hey, if you don't want
that flash drive,

1228
01:11:43,844 --> 01:11:46,276
I could always give it
to the police.

1229
01:11:46,948 --> 01:11:48,612
Go get yourself
an ice cream cone.

1230
01:11:48,644 --> 01:11:50,308
Get yourself
an ice cream cone.

1231
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:53,668
Strawberry.
Like your shirt.

1232
01:11:54,660 --> 01:11:56,644
Come on. Relax.
Relax.

1233
01:11:56,676 --> 01:11:58,116
You're so tense.

1234
01:11:58,148 --> 01:12:00,676
Everything all right?
No problems at home?

1235
01:12:00,707 --> 01:12:02,692
I just want you to know
you can talk to me, all right?

1236
01:12:02,724 --> 01:12:04,772
About anything.

1237
01:12:04,803 --> 01:12:07,396
Lorena was working for me,
all right?

1238
01:12:08,612 --> 01:12:10,116
Not what you think.

1239
01:12:10,148 --> 01:12:12,004
Marital surveillance
on behalf of my sister,

1240
01:12:12,036 --> 01:12:14,244
watching my lazy-ass
brother-in-law.

1241
01:12:14,851 --> 01:12:17,668
Lorena comes to see me at this
chop shop I use as an office.

1242
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:20,036
She sees my mem sitting there.
The bitch palms it.

1243
01:12:20,068 --> 01:12:21,988
She walks out the office
like it's nothing.

1244
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:23,620
Calls me later
saying it's collateral

1245
01:12:23,651 --> 01:12:25,667
on what she claims
I already owe her.

1246
01:12:25,700 --> 01:12:28,612
All right. Look.
I think I got this.

1247
01:12:28,964 --> 01:12:31,524
- You open to a suggestion?
- What you got?

1248
01:12:31,556 --> 01:12:33,444
All right.
I give you the mem.

1249
01:12:33,476 --> 01:12:35,364
You let Lorena come back to L.A.

1250
01:12:35,396 --> 01:12:37,316
We whack up the rest
in small-claims.

1251
01:12:37,348 --> 01:12:38,276
- Yeah?
- Simple.

1252
01:12:38,308 --> 01:12:39,908
It's so simple.

1253
01:12:39,940 --> 01:12:41,764
I can't believe I didn't
fuckin' think of that before.

1254
01:12:41,796 --> 01:12:43,108
What are you, fuckin' nuts?

1255
01:12:43,140 --> 01:12:44,932
I got a reputation to uphold,
Waldo.

1256
01:12:44,964 --> 01:12:47,395
- Are you aware of that...
- Assbags against the wall.

1257
01:12:47,428 --> 01:12:49,667
- Motherfucker!
- Jesus Christ.

1258
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:51,972
If you're looking for Jim's
flash drive, you're out of luck.

1259
01:12:52,004 --> 01:12:54,180
- I didn't bring it.
- What'd you just say, Waldo?

1260
01:12:54,211 --> 01:12:55,171
Sorry.

1261
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:56,548
You got a permit for this?

1262
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:57,508
- No.
- Nah.

1263
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:59,267
I am arresting both of you

1264
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:01,860
for the murder
of Lorena Nascimento.

1265
01:13:03,908 --> 01:13:05,956
You want to read your boy here
the 6:00 news or what?

1266
01:13:05,987 --> 01:13:08,515
Lorena's alive.
I just talked to her.

1267
01:13:08,548 --> 01:13:09,604
- What?
- Yeah.

1268
01:13:09,636 --> 01:13:11,139
- Yeah.
- Fuck!

1269
01:13:11,172 --> 01:13:12,868
Well, who was in her car, then?

1270
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:15,364
I say you both suck
at your jobs.

1271
01:13:15,396 --> 01:13:17,380
Cuppy was never gonna book us
anyway.

1272
01:13:17,411 --> 01:13:19,587
Just another play to squeeze me.
Ain't that right, Cuppy?

1273
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:21,380
You know I'm the only one
in town who doesn't grease

1274
01:13:21,412 --> 01:13:23,204
this motherfuckin'
cocksuckin' motherfucker?

1275
01:13:23,236 --> 01:13:24,868
- Little man...
- Whoa.

1276
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:27,172
...you... you'd better
watch your mouth

1277
01:13:27,204 --> 01:13:30,788
on days that you're followed
around by that douchebag Eskimo.

1278
01:13:30,820 --> 01:13:32,259
What?

1279
01:13:32,292 --> 01:13:34,980
What the...

1280
01:13:35,012 --> 01:13:38,340
He's an Inuit,
you fuckin' philistine.

1281
01:13:38,371 --> 01:13:39,491
Let's go.

1282
01:13:39,524 --> 01:13:41,476
You got another 24 hours, Waldo.

1283
01:13:41,507 --> 01:13:43,236
Okay.

1284
01:13:43,268 --> 01:13:46,307
Come on.
Let's get you up, Cuppy.

1285
01:13:46,340 --> 01:13:48,196
Oh.

1286
01:13:49,220 --> 01:13:50,532
Hi.

1287
01:13:50,564 --> 01:13:52,388
Do you have a school directory
I can look at

1288
01:13:52,419 --> 01:13:55,844
with the names of the students
in each class and their parents?

1289
01:13:55,876 --> 01:13:57,731
It's for Jayne White.

1290
01:14:03,587 --> 01:14:06,148
Thank you.

1291
01:14:11,204 --> 01:14:13,443
Swag Doggg.

1292
01:14:15,780 --> 01:14:17,668
Jamshidi.

1293
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:19,172
Listen. I'm on to something.

1294
01:14:19,203 --> 01:14:21,188
What do you know about
Darius Jamshidi and Swag Doggg?

1295
01:14:21,219 --> 01:14:23,780
Are those animated characters?

1296
01:14:23,812 --> 01:14:25,956
They both wanted me to stay
the hell away from your case.

1297
01:14:25,988 --> 01:14:27,876
I went to the school today
and checked the directory.

1298
01:14:27,908 --> 01:14:29,540
They're parents...

1299
01:14:29,572 --> 01:14:31,748
They're parents
in your daughter's class.

1300
01:14:31,779 --> 01:14:33,732
Now, I'm thinking that Monica
could've been into something

1301
01:14:33,764 --> 01:14:35,140
with these other parents

1302
01:14:35,171 --> 01:14:36,964
and one or more of them
wanted her dead.

1303
01:14:36,995 --> 01:14:39,267
Question is, though, what the
fuck is going on in that class?

1304
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:41,635
Oh, who knows?
Show-and-tell.

1305
01:14:41,668 --> 01:14:43,012
Finger painting. I don't know.

1306
01:14:43,044 --> 01:14:44,804
- Hey! Princess!
- What?

1307
01:14:44,836 --> 01:14:46,820
I'm trying to save your life.
You want to cut the self-pity?

1308
01:14:46,852 --> 01:14:48,484
- Self-pity?
- Look.

1309
01:14:48,515 --> 01:14:50,979
You got a terrific little girl
who already lost her mom.

1310
01:14:51,012 --> 01:14:52,451
Does she have to lose a dad?

1311
01:14:52,484 --> 01:14:53,892
Nobody talks to me that way.

1312
01:14:53,924 --> 01:14:55,748
- And do you know why?
- 'Cause they need the money.

1313
01:14:55,779 --> 01:14:57,603
No, because they know they'll
get a damn good drubbing.

1314
01:14:57,636 --> 01:14:59,236
Put 'em up.
Come on. Your turn, love.

1315
01:14:59,267 --> 01:15:00,324
You'll get a real fight.

1316
01:15:00,356 --> 01:15:01,443
I'm not doing this.

1317
01:15:01,476 --> 01:15:02,980
- Come on.
- I'm not doing this.

1318
01:15:03,011 --> 01:15:04,771
- Alastair, you're too drunk!
- Slippery joker.

1319
01:15:04,804 --> 01:15:06,180
- Alastair...
- Hold still, will you?

1320
01:15:06,212 --> 01:15:08,548
It's not even a fair fight!
You're twice my age!

1321
01:15:08,580 --> 01:15:12,355
Okay. Look. I'm a pacifist,
and I refuse to get involved.

1322
01:15:12,388 --> 01:15:13,636
J...

1323
01:15:13,667 --> 01:15:15,908
Alastair?

1324
01:15:15,939 --> 01:15:17,636
Well earned, sir.

1325
01:15:17,667 --> 01:15:19,268
Have you had enough?

1326
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:20,580
I've had enough.

1327
01:15:20,612 --> 01:15:23,140
Let's you and I have a drink.
Help me up.

1328
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:26,436
Oh, you've trimmed the hedges.
Handsome devil.

1329
01:15:28,804 --> 01:15:31,172
You remember
having mates, don't you, Waldo?

1330
01:15:31,203 --> 01:15:33,060
Not like you.

1331
01:15:33,668 --> 01:15:34,787
There you go.

1332
01:15:34,820 --> 01:15:36,676
You were right, of course.

1333
01:15:36,707 --> 01:15:39,299
I <i>am</i> shit-faced.

1334
01:15:39,331 --> 01:15:40,644
More than usual.

1335
01:15:40,676 --> 01:15:42,436
Chin-chin.

1336
01:15:42,467 --> 01:15:46,307
You know what you should have
done when your young man died?

1337
01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:49,924
You should have gone on
an epic two-week pub crawl,

1338
01:15:49,955 --> 01:15:52,835
gotten it all out
of your system.

1339
01:15:54,340 --> 01:15:56,579
To self-pity.
Hm.

1340
01:15:56,611 --> 01:15:59,907
That was a powerful observation
coming from the master.

1341
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:04,484
You and I are two sides
of the same coin, aren't we?

1342
01:16:04,516 --> 01:16:06,820
And now, here you are,
back among the living

1343
01:16:06,853 --> 01:16:08,740
in a way you weren't
just a week ago.

1344
01:16:08,773 --> 01:16:10,084
Mm.

1345
01:16:10,115 --> 01:16:11,875
- Oh, you see a difference?
- Mm!

1346
01:16:11,908 --> 01:16:14,276
All the difference in the world.

1347
01:16:14,307 --> 01:16:17,027
Dicking refuckulous the way
you confronted me out there.

1348
01:16:17,060 --> 01:16:20,196
You didn't have that in you when
you first shuffled onto my set

1349
01:16:20,228 --> 01:16:23,140
with that rat's nest of a beard
and those dead eyes.

1350
01:16:23,173 --> 01:16:25,604
You've been brought back
to life, mate,

1351
01:16:25,636 --> 01:16:27,973
like so many of us...

1352
01:16:28,004 --> 01:16:31,395
by singular carnal charms.

1353
01:16:35,684 --> 01:16:38,468
Is Jayne keeping the baby?

1354
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:40,835
I think about her all the time.

1355
01:16:40,868 --> 01:16:42,308
But I haven't thought it right
to telephone,

1356
01:16:42,340 --> 01:16:44,163
given the circumstances.

1357
01:16:44,197 --> 01:16:48,068
And I was such a cad,
especially after she told me.

1358
01:16:48,740 --> 01:16:51,651
But I was married, after all,
and what was I to do?

1359
01:16:51,684 --> 01:16:55,780
And then after the business
with my sweet Monica...

1360
01:16:55,813 --> 01:16:58,211
I'm tired, Waldo.

1361
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:04,196
Fearing that you may not be
as good as others believe.

1362
01:17:04,227 --> 01:17:05,699
It's common to all men.

1363
01:17:06,884 --> 01:17:11,620
But fearing that deep down
you may be a monster...

1364
01:17:12,707 --> 01:17:15,491
...that's a whole different
flavor of hell.

1365
01:17:31,140 --> 01:17:32,964
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1366
01:17:32,996 --> 01:17:34,787
<i>we are about to begin.</i>

1367
01:17:34,820 --> 01:17:36,964
<i>Please find your seats.</i>

1368
01:17:46,948 --> 01:17:48,517
Hey.

1369
01:17:49,412 --> 01:17:50,819
Hey.

1370
01:17:52,227 --> 01:17:54,308
You should have told me
about you and Alastair.

1371
01:17:55,011 --> 01:17:57,924
There's nothing to tell.
He's a kindergarten dad.

1372
01:18:04,420 --> 01:18:06,500
Don't worry. It's not Alastair.
It's me.

1373
01:18:07,717 --> 01:18:09,284
I found this burner
in his house.

1374
01:18:09,315 --> 01:18:11,300
On the night his wife died,
he texted back and forth

1375
01:18:11,331 --> 01:18:13,795
with someone, inviting her over.

1376
01:18:13,828 --> 01:18:17,317
Someone... who said
she'd be right there.

1377
01:18:19,076 --> 01:18:21,124
Come on.

1378
01:18:21,157 --> 01:18:22,564
Let's talk.

1379
01:18:28,004 --> 01:18:30,404
Did you have a thing
with Swag Doggg too?

1380
01:18:31,395 --> 01:18:32,963
Yes.

1381
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:36,195
And that crazy rich guy
Jamshidi?

1382
01:18:39,107 --> 01:18:40,804
You know,
I've been getting beaten up

1383
01:18:40,835 --> 01:18:43,684
and threatened all week
because of you.

1384
01:18:43,715 --> 01:18:45,157
It had nothing to do
with Monica Pinch.

1385
01:18:45,188 --> 01:18:46,691
It was a bunch of rich guys

1386
01:18:46,724 --> 01:18:48,644
that didn't want their affairs
with you exposed.

1387
01:18:48,675 --> 01:18:50,499
What do you want, Waldo?

1388
01:18:50,531 --> 01:18:53,828
I'm a thrill-seeker, and I'm
teaching fucking kindergarten.

1389
01:18:53,860 --> 01:18:56,291
And what could be a bigger rush
than sleeping with the detective

1390
01:18:56,324 --> 01:18:58,660
investigating a death
you're involved in?

1391
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:01,059
It wasn't just that.

1392
01:19:02,084 --> 01:19:04,164
I really felt something.

1393
01:19:07,684 --> 01:19:09,604
Start from the beginning.

1394
01:19:09,635 --> 01:19:11,108
And no bullshit.

1395
01:19:14,053 --> 01:19:16,868
I was hoping that he would leave
his wife.

1396
01:19:16,900 --> 01:19:20,068
But he was an asshole,
and he kept talking about

1397
01:19:20,099 --> 01:19:23,524
how she wanted him to move back
to England with her.

1398
01:19:23,557 --> 01:19:27,301
Like, he didn't give a shit
about what I was telling him.

1399
01:19:27,332 --> 01:19:30,915
And after that,
total radio silence.

1400
01:19:30,947 --> 01:19:35,395
But I kept texting him,
which was... probably stupid.

1401
01:19:36,388 --> 01:19:39,012
And then one night, he...
he messaged me back

1402
01:19:39,044 --> 01:19:41,411
saying that...
that Monica was out of the house

1403
01:19:41,444 --> 01:19:43,556
and I should come over
and we could talk about us.

1404
01:19:43,588 --> 01:19:46,051
And before I can even ring
the bell,

1405
01:19:46,083 --> 01:19:49,444
Monica opens the door
and tells me to come inside.

1406
01:19:49,477 --> 01:19:50,979
She's holding his phone.

1407
01:19:51,011 --> 01:19:53,221
She's the one who messaged me
to come over.

1408
01:19:53,252 --> 01:19:57,988
She tells me Alastair's
passed out in the study and...

1409
01:19:58,021 --> 01:20:00,740
she wanted to see who it was.

1410
01:20:00,771 --> 01:20:02,821
When she found out
it was her daughter's teacher,

1411
01:20:02,852 --> 01:20:05,379
she got pretty unhinged.

1412
01:20:05,797 --> 01:20:08,195
Kept talking about...

1413
01:20:09,155 --> 01:20:13,028
...how L.A. was this evil city
and...

1414
01:20:13,059 --> 01:20:15,811
what a mistake it was
coming to L.A.

1415
01:20:16,803 --> 01:20:20,611
I was scared
she was gonna get violent, so...

1416
01:20:20,643 --> 01:20:21,891
I just ran out of there.

1417
01:20:21,925 --> 01:20:22,916
I drove away.

1418
01:20:24,419 --> 01:20:25,861
And then...

1419
01:20:27,428 --> 01:20:30,692
...the next day,
I heard Monica was dead.

1420
01:20:31,299 --> 01:20:34,244
And I tried reaching out
to Alastair,

1421
01:20:34,275 --> 01:20:37,540
but... he was even more
of an asshole.

1422
01:20:37,572 --> 01:20:39,811
He wouldn't talk to me,

1423
01:20:39,843 --> 01:20:42,308
not even when he was
dropping Gaby off.

1424
01:20:43,844 --> 01:20:45,668
So...

1425
01:20:46,531 --> 01:20:50,275
Well, when the... when the chips
started falling on him...

1426
01:20:53,892 --> 01:20:56,291
...I just let them fall.

1427
01:20:59,684 --> 01:21:02,948
And you're pregnant?

1428
01:21:02,979 --> 01:21:04,100
Alastair's?

1429
01:21:08,932 --> 01:21:11,876
Jayne?
We're about to start.

1430
01:21:12,836 --> 01:21:14,275
Yeah.

1431
01:21:14,852 --> 01:21:16,388
Be right there.

1432
01:21:16,419 --> 01:21:18,692
Can we pick this up later?

1433
01:21:20,228 --> 01:21:22,660
After the play and lawyers.

1434
01:21:27,172 --> 01:21:30,212
There's her necklace
and her ring.

1435
01:21:30,244 --> 01:21:33,892
Next I'll take the child
as the king!

1436
01:21:33,925 --> 01:21:35,845
Today I brew.

1437
01:21:35,876 --> 01:21:37,892
Tomorrow I bake.

1438
01:21:37,924 --> 01:21:42,147
And then the prince child
I'll take!

1439
01:21:42,179 --> 01:21:44,772
For no one knows
my little game,

1440
01:21:44,804 --> 01:21:47,524
and Rumpelstiltskin is my name!

1441
01:21:48,580 --> 01:21:51,205
To guess my name?

1442
01:21:51,236 --> 01:21:55,204
She'll never guess!

1443
01:22:03,812 --> 01:22:05,668
Jayne?

1444
01:22:45,603 --> 01:22:47,588
That girl from "Louisiana Law."

1445
01:22:47,619 --> 01:22:49,539
What's her name? Yeah.
I need you to call her agent.

1446
01:22:49,571 --> 01:22:50,980
I mean, is she pregnant
or is it...

1447
01:22:51,012 --> 01:22:53,283
I don't know. She's unhappy?
'Cause it's weird.

1448
01:22:53,315 --> 01:22:54,788
I mean,
I don't know if she changed

1449
01:22:54,820 --> 01:22:57,540
what she's eating, but...

1450
01:22:57,572 --> 01:22:59,236
You tell me.

1451
01:22:59,268 --> 01:23:00,931
But they're feeding her
something very, very strange,

1452
01:23:00,963 --> 01:23:02,915
'cause I have never seen a shape
quite like that.

1453
01:23:03,524 --> 01:23:04,964
Waddling through the lot.

1454
01:23:04,996 --> 01:23:06,691
And I-I was like,

1455
01:23:06,723 --> 01:23:09,892
"It's not gonna work.
I don't want to look at that."

1456
01:23:10,595 --> 01:23:11,845
All right.
Well, you tell him.

1457
01:23:11,876 --> 01:23:12,932
All right. Bye.

1458
01:23:12,964 --> 01:23:13,924
Mr. Waldo!

1459
01:23:13,956 --> 01:23:15,620
Mr. Sikorsky.

1460
01:23:15,652 --> 01:23:18,532
Apologies for the interruption,
but I made some progress.

1461
01:23:18,565 --> 01:23:20,772
Oh, you did?
Fantastic.

1462
01:23:20,804 --> 01:23:21,955
What is that?

1463
01:23:21,987 --> 01:23:23,492
That, my friend, is signed

1464
01:23:23,524 --> 01:23:26,404
by every quarterback
who ever won two Super Bowls.

1465
01:23:26,436 --> 01:23:27,715
May I?

1466
01:23:27,747 --> 01:23:29,156
Please.
Be my guest.

1467
01:23:29,188 --> 01:23:32,005
May I also say it is so good
to see your baby face

1468
01:23:32,036 --> 01:23:33,860
peeking out
where once a dead animal lay.

1469
01:23:33,892 --> 01:23:35,876
And just when you thought I
couldn't get any more handsome.

1470
01:23:35,908 --> 01:23:39,844
I have a run-through, but, um...
fuck 'em.

1471
01:23:39,876 --> 01:23:41,892
I want to hear this.
Shoot.

1472
01:23:41,924 --> 01:23:44,292
It's good news, I guess.

1473
01:23:44,324 --> 01:23:45,604
I know who killed Monica Pinch.

1474
01:23:45,636 --> 01:23:46,979
Fantastic.

1475
01:23:47,011 --> 01:23:49,285
I mean...

1476
01:23:49,316 --> 01:23:50,532
Mm.

1477
01:23:50,564 --> 01:23:53,252
There's a young lady
named Jayne White.

1478
01:23:53,860 --> 01:23:56,196
She was the Pinch girl's
kindergarten teacher.

1479
01:23:56,228 --> 01:23:59,587
What'd a kindergarten teacher
want to kill Monica Pinch for?

1480
01:23:59,620 --> 01:24:01,668
She and Alastair were having
an affair.

1481
01:24:03,812 --> 01:24:05,540
You don't look surprised.

1482
01:24:05,572 --> 01:24:07,139
They had a complicated marriage.

1483
01:24:07,171 --> 01:24:09,220
Well, you knew them pretty well.

1484
01:24:09,252 --> 01:24:11,652
Knew them well.
We did St. Bart's last year.

1485
01:24:11,684 --> 01:24:15,108
I'm just so fuckin' relieved
it's not Alastair, you know?

1486
01:24:15,140 --> 01:24:16,771
- I'm sure you are.
- I knew you were my guy.

1487
01:24:16,803 --> 01:24:18,148
Fontella said,
"Don't hire that bum.

1488
01:24:18,180 --> 01:24:19,876
He stinks in every way."

1489
01:24:19,908 --> 01:24:22,020
But I was like, "No.
That's my guy."

1490
01:24:22,052 --> 01:24:23,780
And do I know casting
or do I know casting?

1491
01:24:23,812 --> 01:24:25,443
Is this chick in custody?

1492
01:24:25,475 --> 01:24:26,724
Are we good?

1493
01:24:26,756 --> 01:24:28,612
- Jayne?
- Yeah.

1494
01:24:28,644 --> 01:24:29,892
No.

1495
01:24:29,924 --> 01:24:31,748
- No. She left town.
- Ah, we'll find her.

1496
01:24:31,780 --> 01:24:34,276
She's a fuckin' kindergarten
teacher, not Whitey Bulger.

1497
01:24:34,308 --> 01:24:36,196
That's a win-win for Waldo
and Sikorsky.

1498
01:24:36,228 --> 01:24:38,532
You get the killer.
I get to keep my syndication.

1499
01:24:38,564 --> 01:24:42,595
I mean, it's a tragedy, but,
you know, as tragedies go...

1500
01:24:42,627 --> 01:24:43,812
- Mm.
- But thank you.

1501
01:24:43,844 --> 01:24:45,092
You know, great job and...

1502
01:24:45,124 --> 01:24:46,820
Did you know Jayne White?

1503
01:24:48,644 --> 01:24:49,988
I know <i>of</i> her.

1504
01:24:50,020 --> 01:24:51,972
Did you know that Alastair
had gotten her pregnant?

1505
01:24:52,004 --> 01:24:53,732
- Hey.
- I'm just wondering

1506
01:24:53,764 --> 01:24:55,620
if that was something
many people were aware of.

1507
01:24:55,652 --> 01:24:58,116
Many people? No.
This is inner-circle stuff.

1508
01:24:58,148 --> 01:25:00,228
Right, but...
you're in the inner circle.

1509
01:25:00,260 --> 01:25:02,020
I <i>founded</i> the inner circle.

1510
01:25:02,052 --> 01:25:04,004
You know, he knows what I'm
doing, if you know what I mean.

1511
01:25:04,036 --> 01:25:05,860
I know what he's doing,
if you know what I mean.

1512
01:25:05,892 --> 01:25:07,236
So what was Monica Pinch's
reaction

1513
01:25:07,268 --> 01:25:08,996
when she found out
Jayne White was pregnant?

1514
01:25:09,028 --> 01:25:10,756
- She was devastated.
- I bet.

1515
01:25:10,788 --> 01:25:12,548
I mean, she probably
pushed Alastair even harder

1516
01:25:12,580 --> 01:25:14,020
to quit the show
and move back to England.

1517
01:25:14,052 --> 01:25:15,684
I can't speak to that
'cause I don't know her

1518
01:25:15,716 --> 01:25:18,340
- as well as I know him.
- Right.

1519
01:25:18,372 --> 01:25:20,164
But you knew about the awards.

1520
01:25:20,196 --> 01:25:22,019
The Shakespeare Awards
you talked about?

1521
01:25:22,051 --> 01:25:23,428
They're called Regis,
by the way.

1522
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:24,835
What did you say?

1523
01:25:24,867 --> 01:25:27,332
You said they were all
under the bed.

1524
01:25:27,364 --> 01:25:28,932
Under the bed, in the attic.
Doesn't matter.

1525
01:25:28,964 --> 01:25:30,020
He just didn't want them around.

1526
01:25:30,052 --> 01:25:31,716
Ah. Gotcha.
It's funny.

1527
01:25:31,748 --> 01:25:33,860
- They <i>were</i> under the bed.
- So?

1528
01:25:33,892 --> 01:25:35,748
It's just Alastair said
he wasn't sure where they were.

1529
01:25:35,780 --> 01:25:37,444
- It's not a big deal.
- Listen.

1530
01:25:37,476 --> 01:25:39,876
This is great chatting with you,
but time is not my friend.

1531
01:25:39,908 --> 01:25:41,540
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'll let you go.

1532
01:25:41,572 --> 01:25:43,075
Thanks.

1533
01:25:43,107 --> 01:25:44,099
Monica Pinch.

1534
01:25:44,580 --> 01:25:46,500
- Quickly.
- Monica Pinch.

1535
01:25:46,532 --> 01:25:49,092
Now, she didn't find out
that Jayne White was pregnant

1536
01:25:49,124 --> 01:25:50,372
until the night she died.

1537
01:25:50,404 --> 01:25:52,324
So if she talked to you
about it,

1538
01:25:52,356 --> 01:25:54,116
it must have been then, right?

1539
01:25:54,148 --> 01:25:59,780
Uh, I'm gonna have to back you
up a second there, Mr. Waldo.

1540
01:26:01,379 --> 01:26:03,524
You said that Jayne White
was the murderer.

1541
01:26:03,556 --> 01:26:06,211
Oh, no. I said I knew
who the murderer was.

1542
01:26:06,244 --> 01:26:09,027
Oh!

1543
01:26:09,699 --> 01:26:11,300
Warren Gomes.

1544
01:26:11,332 --> 01:26:12,867
Does that name mean anything
to you?

1545
01:26:13,284 --> 01:26:15,172
- No.
- Well, he was this lawyer.

1546
01:26:15,204 --> 01:26:16,771
I had a little bit
of a weird thing with him.

1547
01:26:16,804 --> 01:26:18,339
He kept following me
for a couple days,

1548
01:26:18,372 --> 01:26:21,156
and I kind of lost my temper
and I confronted him one day.

1549
01:26:21,188 --> 01:26:22,564
We got into a little fight.

1550
01:26:22,596 --> 01:26:23,844
A couple hours later,
he got killed.

1551
01:26:23,876 --> 01:26:25,315
Yeah?

1552
01:26:25,347 --> 01:26:26,788
I'm just trying to piece
everything together.

1553
01:26:26,820 --> 01:26:29,380
The question is...
why bring it up...

1554
01:26:29,412 --> 01:26:31,300
he had the same kind of watch
as you.

1555
01:26:31,332 --> 01:26:32,676
Rich lawyer.

1556
01:26:32,708 --> 01:26:34,308
That's what I thought.
Only I researched them.

1557
01:26:34,340 --> 01:26:35,971
They'll all individually made,
right?

1558
01:26:36,004 --> 01:26:37,763
No two are identical.

1559
01:26:38,212 --> 01:26:40,004
Here's the thing...
The one he was wearing,

1560
01:26:40,036 --> 01:26:42,595
- it looked a lot like yours.
- Pure coincidence.

1561
01:26:42,627 --> 01:26:44,900
This one hasn't left my wrist
except when I shower and sleep.

1562
01:26:44,932 --> 01:26:46,756
But you asked Fontella
what time it was.

1563
01:26:46,787 --> 01:26:48,099
What? When?

1564
01:26:48,132 --> 01:26:50,371
At the courthouse
after Alastair's arraignment.

1565
01:26:50,404 --> 01:26:52,484
I'm afraid you must be mistaken.

1566
01:26:52,516 --> 01:26:53,572
But, uh...

1567
01:26:53,604 --> 01:26:55,140
Oh, fuck it.

1568
01:26:55,171 --> 01:26:56,324
Take a seat.

1569
01:26:56,356 --> 01:26:57,636
I want to hear everything
you're thinking,

1570
01:26:57,668 --> 01:26:58,915
soup to nuts, all right?

1571
01:26:58,948 --> 01:27:00,484
- Soup to nuts?
- Yes, please.

1572
01:27:00,516 --> 01:27:02,948
- Double-fuck the read-through.
- Let's do that. Let's do it.

1573
01:27:02,980 --> 01:27:04,036
- You sure?
- Yes, sir.

1574
01:27:04,964 --> 01:27:06,595
Buckle up.

1575
01:27:09,124 --> 01:27:10,787
Well, I'm thinking...

1576
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:16,388
...that you knew what
Monica Pinch kept under her bed

1577
01:27:16,420 --> 01:27:18,180
'cause you were spending time
in her bedroom

1578
01:27:18,211 --> 01:27:20,356
while Alastair was spending time
with Jayne.

1579
01:27:23,652 --> 01:27:25,028
Mr. Waldo!

1580
01:27:25,060 --> 01:27:26,884
That is brilliant.

1581
01:27:28,356 --> 01:27:30,756
I'm thinking
that on the night she found out

1582
01:27:30,788 --> 01:27:33,732
that he'd gotten Jayne pregnant,
with Alastair passed out cold,

1583
01:27:33,764 --> 01:27:35,780
I'm thinking
that Monica called you

1584
01:27:35,812 --> 01:27:38,468
to tell you she was gonna
tell Alastair about your affair

1585
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:39,972
to get him to quit the show
and move back to England,

1586
01:27:40,004 --> 01:27:41,412
like she'd been wanting.

1587
01:27:41,444 --> 01:27:42,756
But you couldn't afford
to lose Alastair,

1588
01:27:42,788 --> 01:27:44,739
not with the Jamshidi
takeover threat.

1589
01:27:44,772 --> 01:27:47,971
I'm thinking that you drove
over there.

1590
01:27:48,388 --> 01:27:50,180
You were gonna talk some sense
into Monica.

1591
01:27:50,212 --> 01:27:51,811
But she didn't want to hear it.

1592
01:27:51,844 --> 01:27:53,124
Next thing,
you guys are arguing.

1593
01:27:53,156 --> 01:27:55,012
It escalates,
and you pick up the Regis Award.

1594
01:27:55,044 --> 01:27:56,259
And you hit her with it.

1595
01:27:56,867 --> 01:27:58,884
You didn't mean to do it.
It's an act of passion.

1596
01:27:58,916 --> 01:28:00,996
Thing is, she's hit her head
on the way down,

1597
01:28:01,028 --> 01:28:02,724
and now she's not moving.

1598
01:28:02,756 --> 01:28:04,868
So you panic,
and you start wiping down

1599
01:28:04,899 --> 01:28:06,436
everything you can remember
touching.

1600
01:28:06,467 --> 01:28:08,484
But the Regis Award
was on a wooden table,

1601
01:28:08,516 --> 01:28:10,244
and that had bloodstains on it.

1602
01:28:10,276 --> 01:28:12,964
Now, I'm thinking...
I'm just thinking...

1603
01:28:12,996 --> 01:28:16,004
maybe you were worried that
some of that was your blood.

1604
01:28:16,036 --> 01:28:18,148
You could've got cut
in the fight.

1605
01:28:18,180 --> 01:28:19,780
So now what do you do?

1606
01:28:19,811 --> 01:28:21,860
You swap around some furniture.

1607
01:28:21,892 --> 01:28:23,524
You set the alarm
on the way out.

1608
01:28:23,556 --> 01:28:25,348
You get rid of the Regis
in some dumpster,

1609
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:30,244
and you let poor old Alastair
wake up to take the rap.

1610
01:28:30,596 --> 01:28:32,196
How did I do?

1611
01:28:36,964 --> 01:28:38,499
Come on.

1612
01:28:38,532 --> 01:28:40,323
And the lawyer guy?
What...

1613
01:28:40,356 --> 01:28:42,148
He blackmailed you.

1614
01:28:42,180 --> 01:28:44,036
He even made you cough up
that fancy watch,

1615
01:28:44,068 --> 01:28:47,076
which you couldn't resist
taking back after you shot him.

1616
01:28:48,099 --> 01:28:49,444
Huh?

1617
01:28:51,331 --> 01:28:53,859
That is quite brilliant.

1618
01:28:53,892 --> 01:28:56,260
In fact, I should give you
a pilot deal.

1619
01:28:56,291 --> 01:28:58,307
There <i>is</i> one gaping hole
in your narrative, however.

1620
01:28:58,340 --> 01:29:01,316
Why would I sabotage the biggest
asset on this network?

1621
01:29:01,348 --> 01:29:02,884
Come on.
That's the easy part.

1622
01:29:02,916 --> 01:29:04,164
You told me yourself

1623
01:29:04,196 --> 01:29:06,084
the scandal made the show
twice as valuable.

1624
01:29:06,116 --> 01:29:07,876
You knew Alastair would get off.

1625
01:29:07,907 --> 01:29:09,827
I mean, it's L.A.
The star always gets off.

1626
01:29:09,860 --> 01:29:12,580
And in the meantime,
the more publicity,

1627
01:29:12,611 --> 01:29:14,019
the bigger the windfall.

1628
01:29:14,052 --> 01:29:15,587
So what do you do?

1629
01:29:15,620 --> 01:29:18,148
You hire the lawyer
who'll make the most noise

1630
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:20,196
and then the detective
who would make the most noise,

1631
01:29:20,228 --> 01:29:22,404
even though your lawyer
kept telling you

1632
01:29:22,436 --> 01:29:24,260
I'd be a shitty choice.

1633
01:29:24,292 --> 01:29:25,988
And let's be honest.
I <i>am</i> a shitty choice.

1634
01:29:26,020 --> 01:29:28,196
I've never been a P.I.
The LAPD fucking hates me.

1635
01:29:28,227 --> 01:29:31,332
I'm so rusty,
I'd probably be useless.

1636
01:29:31,364 --> 01:29:34,083
But I think you liked me
for those reasons.

1637
01:29:35,139 --> 01:29:36,932
'Cause that made me
the last detective

1638
01:29:36,963 --> 01:29:40,644
who'd ever figure out
that you killed Monica Pinch.

1639
01:29:41,796 --> 01:29:43,044
<i>And</i> Warren Gomes.

1640
01:29:46,532 --> 01:29:48,964
A lot of moving parts.

1641
01:29:50,307 --> 01:29:52,356
A lot of moving parts.

1642
01:29:55,811 --> 01:29:58,083
I do have one question.

1643
01:29:58,116 --> 01:30:01,732
What made you so sure

1644
01:30:01,764 --> 01:30:04,612
that you walk in here
and deliver that little pitch?

1645
01:30:07,268 --> 01:30:09,412
I'll be honest.

1646
01:30:09,444 --> 01:30:11,588
I only walked in 98% sure.

1647
01:30:11,619 --> 01:30:12,964
Ah.

1648
01:30:16,067 --> 01:30:17,891
What was the other 2%?

1649
01:30:17,924 --> 01:30:20,708
I had to make sure
you were a lefty.

1650
01:30:24,644 --> 01:30:26,883
I did make one mistake, though.

1651
01:30:26,916 --> 01:30:30,756
I really should've waited
until the cops got here.

1652
01:30:30,788 --> 01:30:33,124
You... You told them to come?

1653
01:30:33,155 --> 01:30:35,396
Well, if I timed it right,
they're already downstairs.

1654
01:30:35,427 --> 01:30:39,140
Of course...
I don't have a watch.

1655
01:30:41,124 --> 01:30:42,884
After you.

1656
01:30:42,916 --> 01:30:46,531
Yeah. You just keep smiling.

1657
01:30:46,564 --> 01:30:48,548
Watch your haircut.

1658
01:30:49,956 --> 01:30:52,228
Come on.
Look alive, fellas.

1659
01:30:52,260 --> 01:30:53,796
Pete couldn't make it himself?

1660
01:30:53,828 --> 01:30:55,524
You know he's not gonna let you
out of this collar, right?

1661
01:30:55,556 --> 01:30:57,155
I'm gonna head
to North Hollywood.

1662
01:30:57,188 --> 01:30:58,532
Tell Pete I'll meet him there.

1663
01:30:59,300 --> 01:31:01,316
See you in court!

1664
01:31:01,347 --> 01:31:03,236
What are you doing?!

1665
01:31:03,267 --> 01:31:05,891
Get off my bike!

1666
01:31:05,924 --> 01:31:07,748
We're not cops, man.
We're... We're extras.

1667
01:31:07,780 --> 01:31:09,027
Shut the fuck up.

1668
01:31:12,740 --> 01:31:15,556
Fuck! Fuck!

1669
01:31:33,924 --> 01:31:38,435
<i>Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas!</i>

1670
01:32:53,924 --> 01:32:55,204
Fuck!

1671
01:33:03,044 --> 01:33:04,739
...Lady Justice.

1672
01:33:04,771 --> 01:33:07,107
Make sure that
he isn't prejudiced

1673
01:33:07,140 --> 01:33:09,220
or predispositioned...

1674
01:33:09,253 --> 01:33:11,491
Fuck!

1675
01:33:11,524 --> 01:33:14,020
"For 99 days, you do that,

1676
01:33:14,053 --> 01:33:17,571
and justice, in its natural
wisdom, will find its own way.

1677
01:33:17,604 --> 01:33:19,268
But, Johnnie," he'd say...

1678
01:33:20,387 --> 01:33:22,436
"...on the 100th day,

1679
01:33:22,467 --> 01:33:27,397
a great judge knows
that he needs to <i>be</i> justice."

1680
01:33:29,060 --> 01:33:31,748
- Ready for your close-up?
- Wait! Wait!

1681
01:33:31,780 --> 01:33:33,253
"...I do know
that as I sit here today..."

1682
01:33:33,284 --> 01:33:35,395
How are you gonna get away
with this?

1683
01:33:35,428 --> 01:33:37,891
A light fell on set.
Happens all the time.

1684
01:33:37,924 --> 01:33:39,555
Last looks.

1685
01:33:42,788 --> 01:33:46,564
...and find
this here defendant... guilty.

1686
01:33:57,700 --> 01:34:00,548
What the fuck?
This place is fallin' apart.

1687
01:34:00,997 --> 01:34:02,564
Waldo.

1688
01:34:02,595 --> 01:34:04,291
Hey, Q.

1689
01:34:11,939 --> 01:34:14,276
- Well, that's that, then.
- Yeah.

1690
01:34:14,307 --> 01:34:16,739
Would it be ungrateful
to ask what you're doing here?

1691
01:34:16,771 --> 01:34:19,971
I've been following you
since the recruiting office.

1692
01:34:20,004 --> 01:34:22,820
I even had to sit through
that Rumpelstiltskin bullshit.

1693
01:34:22,851 --> 01:34:24,579
- Really?
- Yeah.

1694
01:34:25,444 --> 01:34:26,980
How'd you get on the lot?

1695
01:34:27,013 --> 01:34:29,828
Snuck in on a studio tour.
Yeah.

1696
01:34:29,860 --> 01:34:31,524
They really need to check out
their security.

1697
01:34:31,556 --> 01:34:34,693
I could be, like, a crazy
stalker or something, you know?

1698
01:34:34,724 --> 01:34:37,477
I, uh, hope you don't mind.
I used your gun.

1699
01:34:38,468 --> 01:34:40,771
I was never here.

1700
01:34:40,804 --> 01:34:41,987
Yeah.
I can work with that.

1701
01:34:42,788 --> 01:34:44,164
Grand.

1702
01:34:45,188 --> 01:34:47,715
You do know why I saved
your ass, right?

1703
01:34:48,771 --> 01:34:50,884
- Yeah, I got an idea.
- Mm.

1704
01:34:53,379 --> 01:34:55,556
Someone else kills you first,
I can't get what I want.

1705
01:34:55,588 --> 01:34:57,028
It'll be a mess.

1706
01:34:57,059 --> 01:34:58,660
Nobody will know what to do
with themselves.

1707
01:34:58,693 --> 01:35:02,147
You know, I got to say, Q,
it's not too clever

1708
01:35:02,180 --> 01:35:04,771
keeping your kind of business
records on a flash drive.

1709
01:35:04,804 --> 01:35:07,011
Is that what Cuppy thinks
is on there?

1710
01:35:07,684 --> 01:35:09,157
Business records.

1711
01:35:09,188 --> 01:35:12,548
The guy's an idiot.

1712
01:35:12,579 --> 01:35:16,195
Why?
What <i>is</i> on there?

1713
01:35:16,228 --> 01:35:17,732
Epic poem.

1714
01:35:19,108 --> 01:35:21,059
Long-ass motherfucker, too.

1715
01:35:21,091 --> 01:35:23,108
It's the only copy I got.

1716
01:35:23,139 --> 01:35:25,091
Epic poem that you wrote?

1717
01:35:25,124 --> 01:35:26,533
Yeah, that I wrote.

1718
01:35:26,564 --> 01:35:28,804
- Ah.
- It's about the life of a dealer

1719
01:35:28,835 --> 01:35:30,659
trying to retain
his independence and integrity

1720
01:35:30,691 --> 01:35:33,475
in an era
of corporate-style cartels.

1721
01:35:33,956 --> 01:35:35,876
Why an epic poem?

1722
01:35:35,908 --> 01:35:38,308
See, me, I'm an autodidact.

1723
01:35:38,339 --> 01:35:41,348
Means I'm self-educated.
I had to enrich my own life.

1724
01:35:41,379 --> 01:35:44,740
But my little girl, Dulcy...

1725
01:35:44,772 --> 01:35:48,421
I'm gonna make sure my daughter
gets a real education.

1726
01:35:48,452 --> 01:35:52,004
That way, she ain't stuck
being no cop, no dealer.

1727
01:35:52,035 --> 01:35:53,924
I want to give the poem to her

1728
01:35:53,955 --> 01:35:56,132
so she can see the man
I really am.

1729
01:35:57,731 --> 01:35:59,876
Waldo, I need my mem.

1730
01:35:59,908 --> 01:36:03,781
I need Lorena to come back,
so...

1731
01:36:03,812 --> 01:36:05,507
I'll tell you what.

1732
01:36:05,540 --> 01:36:06,788
I want you to get my little girl

1733
01:36:06,820 --> 01:36:09,251
into that fancy-ass
private school.

1734
01:36:09,284 --> 01:36:11,300
Same one as that
British dude's kid.

1735
01:36:11,971 --> 01:36:14,500
Get him to help Dulcy
and bring me back my mem,

1736
01:36:14,532 --> 01:36:16,675
and Lorena can come back.

1737
01:36:16,708 --> 01:36:18,788
Have you got the juice for that?

1738
01:36:18,819 --> 01:36:21,668
You know, I just might.

1739
01:36:24,132 --> 01:36:28,323
Okay, Waldo.
You got another 24 hours.

1740
01:36:30,148 --> 01:36:33,923
By the way,
I love Johnnie's bench.

1741
01:36:39,397 --> 01:36:41,027
You know,

1742
01:36:41,060 --> 01:36:43,012
my granddaddy once said...

1743
01:36:47,172 --> 01:36:50,468
"...It's one thing to write
like a poet...

1744
01:36:50,948 --> 01:36:54,435
...and another thing altogether
to write like a historian.

1745
01:36:57,284 --> 01:37:01,285
A poet can rehash
or sing about things

1746
01:37:01,316 --> 01:37:05,125
not like they were
but like they should have been.

1747
01:37:07,748 --> 01:37:09,508
And the historian...

1748
01:37:10,820 --> 01:37:12,132
...well, he's got to write
about them

1749
01:37:12,164 --> 01:37:13,732
not like they
should have been..."

1750
01:37:13,765 --> 01:37:15,395
Fuckin' Lorena.

1751
01:37:15,428 --> 01:37:17,507
"...but like they were...

1752
01:37:19,203 --> 01:37:22,660
...without adding or subtracting
anything from the truth."

1753
01:37:24,068 --> 01:37:25,444
And might I remind you,
Counselor,

1754
01:37:25,476 --> 01:37:28,835
you're getting dangerously close
to rufflin' my feathers.

1755
01:37:28,868 --> 01:37:30,691
Do you understand the words
"contempt of court"?

1756
01:37:31,811 --> 01:37:33,124
Come in.

1757
01:37:34,212 --> 01:37:36,772
Aha!
The man of the hour.

1758
01:37:36,805 --> 01:37:39,652
Come here.
Deftly done, my old cockalorum.

1759
01:37:39,685 --> 01:37:40,932
No tongues.

1760
01:37:40,964 --> 01:37:42,756
Come in. Sit down.
Sit.

1761
01:37:42,788 --> 01:37:45,123
I want to lavish praise on you.

1762
01:37:46,628 --> 01:37:48,580
Is it too much of a cliché
to say...

1763
01:37:48,612 --> 01:37:50,276
I don't know how to thank you?

1764
01:37:50,308 --> 01:37:52,931
Is it too much of a cliché
to say I might have an idea?

1765
01:37:52,964 --> 01:37:54,915
- Shoot.
- I'm thinking you were right

1766
01:37:54,948 --> 01:37:56,804
about that epic
two-week pub crawl.

1767
01:37:56,835 --> 01:37:58,084
That's a brilliant idea.

1768
01:37:58,116 --> 01:38:00,068
Unfortunately, as of today...

1769
01:38:02,948 --> 01:38:06,339
...this is my liquor of choice.

1770
01:38:08,228 --> 01:38:09,476
- Sober as a judge.
- Yes.

1771
01:38:09,508 --> 01:38:11,556
Very good.

1772
01:38:11,588 --> 01:38:13,381
I may drop dead any second,

1773
01:38:13,412 --> 01:38:15,332
but at least now
I'm not inviting it.

1774
01:38:16,324 --> 01:38:18,788
I made a shambles of everything,
Waldo.

1775
01:38:18,819 --> 01:38:20,515
Monica's gone.

1776
01:38:20,547 --> 01:38:23,140
Jayne's run off with her son
or daughter... I may never know.

1777
01:38:24,387 --> 01:38:28,227
On the other hand,
I do have my sweet Gaby.

1778
01:38:28,259 --> 01:38:29,508
And the least I owe her

1779
01:38:29,540 --> 01:38:31,460
is the best I have.

1780
01:38:31,492 --> 01:38:34,083
That could take more courage
than drinking yourself to death.

1781
01:38:34,115 --> 01:38:36,580
Don't I know it.

1782
01:38:37,381 --> 01:38:38,819
Courage, mate.

1783
01:38:38,851 --> 01:38:41,060
Cheers.

1784
01:38:41,092 --> 01:38:43,268
- Ready for you, Mr. Pinch.
- Yes. Let's off.

1785
01:38:43,876 --> 01:38:45,892
And, uh, don't tell anyone
about this.

1786
01:38:45,925 --> 01:38:47,555
If they think I'm still a drunk,

1787
01:38:47,588 --> 01:38:50,371
they'll still let me paste
the occasional pretty boy.

1788
01:39:02,308 --> 01:39:04,196
I got your text.

1789
01:39:05,667 --> 01:39:08,228
Thanks for squaring things
with Q.

1790
01:39:08,260 --> 01:39:10,467
And yet all you talked about
was Pinch.

1791
01:39:10,885 --> 01:39:12,900
I wanted you to do that, too.

1792
01:39:12,932 --> 01:39:14,564
I hope I didn't cause you
too much trouble.

1793
01:39:14,596 --> 01:39:17,572
Oh, not at all.
I made some new friends.

1794
01:39:17,924 --> 01:39:19,492
Well, if you're up for it,

1795
01:39:19,525 --> 01:39:21,188
I've got something else
we could work together.

1796
01:39:21,219 --> 01:39:23,043
You know,
I don't think my face can take

1797
01:39:23,075 --> 01:39:24,068
much more of your action.

1798
01:39:24,099 --> 01:39:25,348
Oh, stop being such a princess.

1799
01:39:25,380 --> 01:39:27,811
You know you loved
every minute of it.

1800
01:39:28,771 --> 01:39:30,052
You look good.

1801
01:39:30,085 --> 01:39:32,036
Yeah.
You look pretty good yourself...

1802
01:39:32,068 --> 01:39:33,475
for a dead woman.

1803
01:39:33,507 --> 01:39:34,756
How'd you pull that off?

1804
01:39:34,788 --> 01:39:36,964
A coroner down in San Berdoo
owed me a favor.

1805
01:39:36,996 --> 01:39:38,852
They let me have a Jane Doe
they were gonna cremate.

1806
01:39:38,884 --> 01:39:41,251
So I burned her
in my ex-husband's car.

1807
01:39:41,283 --> 01:39:42,532
Ex-husband?

1808
01:39:42,565 --> 01:39:44,995
- Almost ex.
- Mm.

1809
01:39:45,572 --> 01:39:47,620
What, you want me to tell you
if it what bothers me

1810
01:39:47,652 --> 01:39:50,052
that you got married?

1811
01:39:50,084 --> 01:39:52,100
I don't need you to tell me.

1812
01:39:54,627 --> 01:39:57,156
And you disappeared on me.
I don't owe you anything.

1813
01:39:57,188 --> 01:39:58,788
Hey, I didn't say you did.

1814
01:39:58,820 --> 01:40:00,805
Why don't you tell me
what happened to your beard?

1815
01:40:02,916 --> 01:40:04,420
Who was she?

1816
01:40:04,452 --> 01:40:05,572
You were dead.

1817
01:40:05,605 --> 01:40:07,492
Barely!
My body wasn't even cold.

1818
01:40:07,525 --> 01:40:08,485
I was grieving.

1819
01:40:08,516 --> 01:40:11,140
Oh, you know what?
Fuck it.

1820
01:40:12,963 --> 01:40:15,332
So that's it? You just breeze in
and breeze back out?

1821
01:40:15,364 --> 01:40:17,092
You ghosted me for three years.

1822
01:40:17,125 --> 01:40:19,876
Then I drive up your stupid
mountain, and you're Ice Man.

1823
01:40:19,908 --> 01:40:21,924
Then you come out here,
one week in L.A.,

1824
01:40:21,956 --> 01:40:23,812
and you've got some little...

1825
01:40:23,844 --> 01:40:25,315
You know what?
Forget it, Waldo.

1826
01:40:25,347 --> 01:40:26,916
I don't know
what I was thinking.

1827
01:40:35,460 --> 01:40:37,348
Fuckin' Lorena.

1828
01:40:46,244 --> 01:40:50,564
Jesus fucking Christ.

1829
01:40:50,596 --> 01:40:52,356
Fuck me.

1830
01:41:08,196 --> 01:41:11,172
Give you a ride somewhere?

1831
01:41:11,204 --> 01:41:12,644
In this?

1832
01:41:12,676 --> 01:41:15,364
What's it get,
four miles to the gallon?

1833
01:41:15,396 --> 01:41:16,676
It's a C 300.

1834
01:41:16,708 --> 01:41:18,660
I dropped 55K on it,
and I fucking love it.

1835
01:41:18,692 --> 01:41:21,476
So what's it gonna take
to get you to shut up about it?

1836
01:41:22,436 --> 01:41:24,452
Let me drive?

1837
01:41:24,484 --> 01:41:26,372
Jesus, Waldo.

1838
01:41:53,028 --> 01:41:55,522
