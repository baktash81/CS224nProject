00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:47,599
You Red Welby?

3
00:03:47,601 --> 00:03:48,867
Yes, ma'am.
How may I help you?

4
00:03:48,869 --> 00:03:50,969
Are you in charge
of renting

5
00:03:50,971 --> 00:03:52,571
the three billboards out
on Drinkwater Road?

6
00:03:52,573 --> 00:03:54,672
I didn't know we had
any billboards on...

7
00:03:54,674 --> 00:03:55,974
Where is Drinkwater Road?

8
00:03:55,976 --> 00:03:57,674
Past Sizemore turn-off.

9
00:03:57,676 --> 00:03:59,714
Nobody uses it since the
freeway got put in.

10
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,851
You're right.

11
00:04:07,853 --> 00:04:09,053
We got three billboards
out there.

12
00:04:09,055 --> 00:04:13,158
Nobody's put nothing
up there since 1986.

13
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,358
That was Huggies.

14
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,896
How much to rent all three
of them out for the year?

15
00:04:17,563 --> 00:04:19,131
A year?

16
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:21,698
On a road
that no one goes down

17
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,934
unless they got lost
or they're retards...

18
00:04:22,936 --> 00:04:23,968
For a year?

19
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,306
Quick, ain't you, Welby?

20
00:04:27,306 --> 00:04:28,342
Well,

21
00:04:29,576 --> 00:04:31,509
since what I say
goes these days

22
00:04:31,511 --> 00:04:33,345
down at the Ebbing
Advertising Desk...

23
00:04:33,347 --> 00:04:35,812
I'm gonna strike you
a real good deal.

24
00:04:35,814 --> 00:04:37,381
What's your name?

25
00:04:37,383 --> 00:04:40,985
What's the law on what you can
and cannot say on a billboard?

26
00:04:40,987 --> 00:04:43,388
Nothing defamatory,

27
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:46,323
and you can't say "fuck",
"piss" or "cunt". That right?

28
00:04:46,325 --> 00:04:47,328
Uh...

29
00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:49,930
Or...

30
00:04:50,431 --> 00:04:51,696
Anus.

31
00:04:51,698 --> 00:04:54,400
Well, I think
I'll be all right then.

32
00:04:57,037 --> 00:04:59,004
Here's 5,000
for the first month.

33
00:04:59,006 --> 00:05:00,306
I assume that'll cover it.

34
00:05:01,275 --> 00:05:03,607
And here's what
they are to say.

35
00:05:03,609 --> 00:05:04,842
Why don't you
write up a contract

36
00:05:04,844 --> 00:05:06,278
betwixt us
while you're at it.

37
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,520
Make sure nobody rents them
billboards out from under me.

38
00:05:13,052 --> 00:05:15,186
I guess you're
Angela Hayes's mother.

39
00:05:15,188 --> 00:05:18,359
That's right.
I'm Angela Hayes's mother.

40
00:05:24,898 --> 00:05:26,199
Name's Mildred.

41
00:05:28,068 --> 00:05:30,201
How long before
you get them put up?

42
00:05:31,503 --> 00:05:33,474
Shall we say by...

43
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,975
Easter Sunday?

44
00:05:37,044 --> 00:05:38,378
That would be perfect.

45
00:05:42,181 --> 00:05:46,384
<i>♪ As I was walking
down the streets of Laredo ♪</i>

46
00:05:48,054 --> 00:05:53,225
<i>♪ As I walked down

47
00:05:54,727 --> 00:05:58,595
<i>♪ I spied a young cowboy

48

49
00:06:21,087 --> 00:06:22,821
Hey, what the hell
is this?

50
00:06:22,823 --> 00:06:24,090
<i>Que?</i>

51
00:06:25,191 --> 00:06:26,958
"How come,
Chief Willoughby" what?

52
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,559
- What?
- Yeah.

53
00:06:28,561 --> 00:06:29,627
Huh?

54
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:30,694
"How come" what?

55
00:06:30,696 --> 00:06:32,530
- What, what?
- What?

56
00:06:32,532 --> 00:06:33,932
Listen,
you fucking beaner,

57
00:06:33,934 --> 00:06:36,001
I'd better start getting
some straight answers.

58
00:06:36,003 --> 00:06:37,304
Put that down.

59
00:07:06,633 --> 00:07:08,232
What the hell is this?

60
00:07:08,234 --> 00:07:10,901
Hey, you.
What the fuck is this?

61
00:07:10,903 --> 00:07:12,304
What the fuck
is what?

62
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:14,341
This! This.

63
00:07:17,777 --> 00:07:19,343
Advertising, I guess.

64
00:07:19,345 --> 00:07:20,480
Advertising what?

65
00:07:27,854 --> 00:07:29,223
Something obscure?

66
00:07:29,989 --> 00:07:32,857
I'll say. Yeah.

67
00:07:32,859 --> 00:07:34,627
Don't I know your face
from some place?

68
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:37,127
I don't know, do you?

69
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:39,499
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

70
00:07:42,936 --> 00:07:44,901
I could arrest you
right now...

71
00:07:44,903 --> 00:07:46,037
For what?

72
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:47,237
For emptying your bucket.

73
00:07:47,239 --> 00:07:50,908
That's being bad against
the environment laws.

74
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:55,547
Well, before you do that,
Officer Dixon,

75
00:07:55,549 --> 00:07:56,915
how about
you have a look

76
00:07:56,917 --> 00:07:58,915
at that first billboard
over there?

77
00:07:58,917 --> 00:08:00,852
And then we can have
ourself a conversation

78
00:08:00,854 --> 00:08:03,521
about the motherfucking
environment.

79
00:08:03,523 --> 00:08:05,359
How about that?

80
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,576
Fuck me.

81
00:08:28,414 --> 00:08:30,150
Don't, William.

82
00:08:34,086 --> 00:08:36,120
Dixon, you goddamn asshole.

83
00:08:36,122 --> 00:08:39,159
I'm in the middle
of my goddamn Easter dinner.

84
00:08:39,692 --> 00:08:41,092
Sorry, kids.

85
00:08:41,094 --> 00:08:42,492
I know, Chief,

86
00:08:42,494 --> 00:08:45,063
and I'm sorry for calling
you at home and all, but...

87
00:08:45,065 --> 00:08:47,734
I think we got kind of a problem.

88
00:10:08,215 --> 00:10:09,749
No, no. Go back.

89
00:10:34,374 --> 00:10:36,442
Sorry I'm late, Denise.

90
00:10:37,474 --> 00:10:38,910
Did you put up
those billboards yet?

91
00:10:38,912 --> 00:10:39,944
They're up.

92
00:10:39,946 --> 00:10:44,247
Go, girl. You go
fuck those cops up.

93
00:10:44,249 --> 00:10:46,918
What the fuck do you think
you're doing, Welby?

94
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,654
You didn't think there would
be legal ramifications?

95
00:10:49,656 --> 00:10:51,322
What's the legal
ramifications, Cedric?

96
00:10:51,324 --> 00:10:53,492
Do you want
me to explain?

97
00:10:53,494 --> 00:10:55,794
Little punk like you.
And don't call me Cedric!

98
00:10:55,796 --> 00:10:59,663
Ain't contravening no laws
on any fucking thing.

99
00:10:59,665 --> 00:11:00,531
I checked.

100
00:11:00,533 --> 00:11:02,565
And where did you check
all this out?

101
00:11:02,567 --> 00:11:03,834
In a...

102
00:11:03,836 --> 00:11:04,969
A book.

103
00:11:04,971 --> 00:11:06,304
Which book, genius?

104
00:11:06,306 --> 00:11:08,876
Book called <i>Suck My Ass,
It's None Of Your Business.</i>

105
00:11:12,812 --> 00:11:15,313
Fuck.

106
00:11:15,315 --> 00:11:18,116
How long has this person,
or persons,

107
00:11:18,118 --> 00:11:20,117
rented these
billboards out for?

108
00:11:20,119 --> 00:11:22,655
Oh, the year.

109
00:11:23,657 --> 00:11:25,792
How long has she
actually paid for?

110
00:11:26,725 --> 00:11:28,125
The year.

111
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,397
So it's a "she", is it?

112
00:11:32,132 --> 00:11:33,899
I ain't at liberty
to divulge

113
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,702
that kind of information,
Chief.

114
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:40,174
Mildred Hayes, perhaps?

115
00:11:41,007 --> 00:11:42,140
Ain't at liberty
to divulge

116
00:11:42,142 --> 00:11:43,841
that kind of information,
Chief.

117
00:11:43,843 --> 00:11:44,742
Do you really wanna fuck

118
00:11:44,744 --> 00:11:46,977
with the Ebbing
Police Department, Red?

119
00:11:46,979 --> 00:11:48,282
Do you?

120
00:11:49,749 --> 00:11:51,181
I guess.

121
00:11:51,183 --> 00:11:53,284
He said what?
To your face?

122
00:11:53,286 --> 00:11:54,685
No crime has been
committed here.

123
00:11:54,687 --> 00:11:57,021
Defamation of character
ain't a crime?

124
00:11:57,023 --> 00:11:59,857
Not if she's simply
asking a question.

125
00:11:59,859 --> 00:12:00,891
What are you, an idiot?

126
00:12:00,893 --> 00:12:02,425
Don't call me
an idiot, Dixon!

127
00:12:02,427 --> 00:12:03,661
I didn't
call you an idiot,

128
00:12:03,663 --> 00:12:05,463
I asked if you was an idiot.
That was a question.

129
00:12:05,465 --> 00:12:06,865
He got you there, Cedric.

130
00:12:06,867 --> 00:12:08,232
That's it.

131
00:12:08,234 --> 00:12:10,035
Don't fly off the handle.

132
00:12:10,037 --> 00:12:11,435
Why in the hell
you keep that man on?

133
00:12:11,437 --> 00:12:12,636
He's a good man at heart.

134
00:12:12,638 --> 00:12:14,804
He tortured a guy
in custody, Bill.

135
00:12:14,806 --> 00:12:18,378
There was no real evidence
to support that.

136
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:22,713
Take them down.

137
00:12:22,715 --> 00:12:23,848
Take that shit down.

138
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:24,915
What shit?

139
00:12:24,917 --> 00:12:27,919
Hey, boy. Think I wouldn't
take you out right here

140
00:12:27,921 --> 00:12:28,920
on Main Street, Red?

141
00:12:28,922 --> 00:12:31,856
Thought you only took out
black dudes, Dixon.

142
00:12:31,858 --> 00:12:34,190
No! No! Stop it.

143
00:12:34,192 --> 00:12:36,929
You ever fucking touch me,
motherfucker...

144
00:12:38,598 --> 00:12:39,764
You drunk?

145
00:12:39,766 --> 00:12:41,935
- Are you drunk right now?
- Get up.

146
00:12:44,604 --> 00:12:47,304
Nobody ever goes
down that road anyways.

147
00:12:47,306 --> 00:12:51,107
Unless they got lost.
Or they're retards.

148
00:12:51,109 --> 00:12:52,843
Don't be nervous,
is the main thing.

149
00:12:52,845 --> 00:12:54,478
It will go just fine.

150
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,146
Don't look into the
camera, obviously.

151
00:12:56,148 --> 00:12:57,618
Let's hold
for this car.

152
00:12:59,952 --> 00:13:02,185
In three, two, one.

153
00:13:02,187 --> 00:13:04,822
So, Mildred Hayes, why did
you put up these billboards?

154
00:13:04,824 --> 00:13:06,623
<i>My daughter, Angela,</i>

155
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,425
<i>was abducted,
raped and murdered</i>

156
00:13:08,427 --> 00:13:09,526
<i>seven months ago</i>

157
00:13:09,528 --> 00:13:11,228
<i>along this selfsame
stretch of road.</i>

158
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,497
What you watching,
Momma? Stupid news?

159
00:13:13,499 --> 00:13:15,400
<i>Seems to me
the local police department</i>

160
00:13:15,402 --> 00:13:17,568
<i>is too busy
torturing black folks</i>

161
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:21,039
<i>to be bothered doing anything
about solving actual crime.</i>

162
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,240
<i>I thought these billboards</i>

163
00:13:22,242 --> 00:13:24,775
<i>might concentrate
their minds some.</i>

164
00:13:24,777 --> 00:13:26,376
Fuck.

165
00:13:26,378 --> 00:13:28,378
<i>I don't know
what the police are doing.</i>

166
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,713
<i>I do know that my...</i>

167
00:13:29,715 --> 00:13:33,383
...daughter's burnt body
is lying six feet underground.

168
00:13:33,385 --> 00:13:35,251
They're eating
Krispy Kremes

169
00:13:35,253 --> 00:13:36,386
<i>and busting eight-year-olds</i>

170
00:13:36,388 --> 00:13:38,289
<i>for skating
around parking lots.</i>

171
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:39,924
<i>And Chief Willoughby,</i>

172
00:13:39,926 --> 00:13:41,157
<i>why single him out?</i>

173
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:42,525
<i>He's the head of them.</i>

174
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,228
<i>Buck's gotta stop somewhere.</i>

175
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,429
<i>And the buck
stops at Willoughby?</i>

176
00:13:45,431 --> 00:13:47,799
<i>Yeah.
Dead right it does.</i>

177
00:14:03,483 --> 00:14:05,018
You all right
there, fella?

178
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:10,056
Looks like we got a war
on our hands.

179
00:14:33,812 --> 00:14:34,914
Can we talk?

180
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,987
I'd do anything
to catch the guy

181
00:14:42,989 --> 00:14:44,122
who did it,
Mrs. Hayes.

182
00:14:44,124 --> 00:14:45,622
But when the DNA
don't match

183
00:14:45,624 --> 00:14:47,558
no one who's ever
been arrested,

184
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:51,362
and when the DNA don't match
any other crime nationwide,

185
00:14:51,364 --> 00:14:53,863
and when there wasn't
a single eyewitness

186
00:14:53,865 --> 00:14:55,532
from the time
she'd left your house

187
00:14:55,534 --> 00:14:57,002
to the time we found her,

188
00:14:58,071 --> 00:15:01,104
right now there ain't
too much more we can do.

189
00:15:01,106 --> 00:15:04,342
Could pull blood from every
man and boy in this town

190
00:15:04,344 --> 00:15:07,144
over the age of eight.

191
00:15:07,146 --> 00:15:10,548
There's civil rights laws
prevents that, Mrs. Hayes.

192
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,516
What if he was just
passing through town?

193
00:15:12,518 --> 00:15:14,352
Every man
in the country, then.

194
00:15:14,354 --> 00:15:16,621
What if he was just passing
through the country?

195
00:15:16,623 --> 00:15:19,589
If it was me,
I'd start up a database.

196
00:15:19,591 --> 00:15:22,359
Every male baby what's
born, stick them on it,

197
00:15:22,361 --> 00:15:24,562
and as soon as he done
something wrong,

198
00:15:24,564 --> 00:15:25,728
cross-reference it,

199
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:28,500
make 100% certain
it was a correct match,

200
00:15:28,502 --> 00:15:29,835
then kill him.

201
00:15:31,771 --> 00:15:35,473
Yeah, well, there's
definitely civil rights laws

202
00:15:35,475 --> 00:15:36,777
prevents that.

203
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:44,082
I'm doing everything I can
to track him down.

204
00:15:44,084 --> 00:15:47,450
I don't think those
billboards is very fair.

205
00:15:47,452 --> 00:15:49,453
The time it took you
to get out here

206
00:15:49,455 --> 00:15:50,687
whining like a bitch,
Willoughby,

207
00:15:50,689 --> 00:15:52,088
some other poor girl's
probably

208
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,089
being butchered
right now.

209
00:15:53,091 --> 00:15:54,458
But I'm glad you got
your priorities straight,

210
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,961
I'll say that for you.

211
00:16:04,336 --> 00:16:06,672
There's something else,
Mildred.

212
00:16:11,277 --> 00:16:12,646
I got cancer.

213
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,413
I'm dying.

214
00:16:15,415 --> 00:16:16,716
I know it.

215
00:16:19,351 --> 00:16:20,550
Huh?

216
00:16:20,552 --> 00:16:23,123
I know it. Most everybody
in town knows it.

217
00:16:28,427 --> 00:16:30,627
And you still put up
those billboards?

218
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:32,163
Well, they wouldn't be
as effective

219
00:16:32,165 --> 00:16:34,167
after you croak.
Right?

220
00:17:15,407 --> 00:17:17,307
Well, looky looky.

221
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:18,576
If it ain't
the instigator

222
00:17:18,578 --> 00:17:20,778
of this whole goddamn affair
in the first place.

223
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,913
I didn't
instigate shit, Dixon.

224
00:17:22,915 --> 00:17:25,415
Playing pool
against the town midget.

225
00:17:25,417 --> 00:17:26,584
He's right, Red,

226
00:17:26,586 --> 00:17:28,618
you are playing pool
against the town midget.

227
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,754
He's a cop,
he's observant.

228
00:17:30,756 --> 00:17:32,790
I always disliked you,

229
00:17:32,792 --> 00:17:35,091
ever since you was
a snotty little child.

230
00:17:35,093 --> 00:17:37,895
You still look like
a snotty little child.

231
00:17:37,897 --> 00:17:40,731
That's unfortunate. I always
thought you was great.

232
00:17:40,733 --> 00:17:46,236
Even your name, Red Welby.
Even your name I disliked.

233
00:17:46,238 --> 00:17:48,772
Well, okay.

234
00:17:48,774 --> 00:17:52,676
Like you was some kind of
goddamn communist

235
00:17:52,678 --> 00:17:53,845
and proud of it.

236
00:17:53,847 --> 00:17:57,815
No, it's because
I got red hair.

237
00:17:57,817 --> 00:17:59,215
You know what they do
to faggots

238
00:17:59,217 --> 00:18:00,553
down in Cuba, Welby?

239
00:18:01,186 --> 00:18:02,353
Wow, that's left field.

240
00:18:02,355 --> 00:18:05,325
No, what do they do to
faggots down in Cuba, Dixon?

241
00:18:06,091 --> 00:18:07,290
They kill them.

242
00:18:07,292 --> 00:18:11,296
Which, it might surprise you
to learn, I'm against.

243
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:12,696
I'm not sure if they do
kill faggots

244
00:18:12,698 --> 00:18:13,998
down in Cuba, Dixon.

245
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,299
I know Cuba's human rights
record's pretty deplorable

246
00:18:16,301 --> 00:18:18,569
when it comes to
homosexuality,

247
00:18:18,571 --> 00:18:20,870
but killing them?

248
00:18:20,872 --> 00:18:23,707
Are you sure you ain't
thinking of Wyoming?

249
00:18:23,709 --> 00:18:26,876
Always gotta be
the smart-ass, Jesus.

250
00:18:26,878 --> 00:18:28,581
He's quite good,
isn't he?

251
00:18:32,752 --> 00:18:36,119
Hey, Willoughby's a good man.
Hey, look at me. Look at me.

252
00:18:36,121 --> 00:18:38,289
I'm talking nice
to you now, aren't I?

253
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:39,792
I'm talking nice to you.

254
00:18:40,459 --> 00:18:41,992
He's a good man.

255
00:18:41,994 --> 00:18:44,661
Shouldn't have this be the
only thing he thinks about,

256
00:18:44,663 --> 00:18:46,299
last months left to him.

257
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,202
Last months what?

258
00:18:53,505 --> 00:18:55,172
Oh...

259
00:18:55,174 --> 00:18:57,241
You didn't know?

260
00:18:57,243 --> 00:18:59,076
Yeah, pancreatic.

261
00:18:59,078 --> 00:19:02,546
I'm up next. You old
ladies quit yakking.

262
00:19:02,548 --> 00:19:03,646
Rude.

263
00:19:03,648 --> 00:19:04,882
Hey, Mildred.

264
00:19:04,884 --> 00:19:07,518
I saw you on TV
the other day.

265
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,953
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, you looked good.

266
00:19:09,955 --> 00:19:13,156
I mean, you know,
you came across really good

267
00:19:13,158 --> 00:19:15,059
in the things
that you were saying.

268
00:19:15,061 --> 00:19:17,226
I didn't think you
came across real good.

269
00:19:17,228 --> 00:19:20,764
I thought you came across
as a stupid-ass.

270
00:19:20,766 --> 00:19:21,866
Ain't it about time
you got home

271
00:19:21,868 --> 00:19:23,701
to your momma, Dixon?

272
00:19:23,703 --> 00:19:26,904
No, it ain't time
I go home to my momma.

273
00:19:26,906 --> 00:19:31,075
I told her I was gonna be out
till 12:00, actually.

274
00:19:31,077 --> 00:19:32,145
Jesus.

275
00:19:37,684 --> 00:19:41,551
That's me versus you,
Mildred. Uh-huh.

276
00:19:41,553 --> 00:19:43,553
Hey, Robbie.
I think that midget

277
00:19:43,555 --> 00:19:45,722
wants to get in my pants.

278
00:19:45,724 --> 00:19:48,026
Father Montgomery.

279
00:19:48,028 --> 00:19:52,163
Mildred. I'm sorry to be
calling on you so late,

280
00:19:52,165 --> 00:19:53,396
but, uh...

281
00:19:53,398 --> 00:19:57,401
I must say, Robbie has
been the consummate host.

282
00:19:57,403 --> 00:20:01,172
Despite his having had,
as he was just telling me

283
00:20:01,174 --> 00:20:03,206
somewhat of a tricky day
at school.

284
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:06,242
Just some of the guys
on the team giving me crap.

285
00:20:06,244 --> 00:20:07,543
Crap about what?

286
00:20:07,545 --> 00:20:10,180
About the billboards,
Mildred.

287
00:20:10,182 --> 00:20:12,649
Which is what I've come to
have a word with you about.

288
00:20:12,651 --> 00:20:15,019
Oh. Proceed.

289
00:20:15,021 --> 00:20:17,887
I know how hard it's
been for you, Mildred,

290
00:20:17,889 --> 00:20:19,790
this past year.
We all do.

291
00:20:19,792 --> 00:20:22,960
And if there is ever
anything that you need,

292
00:20:22,962 --> 00:20:24,594
we will be there for you.

293
00:20:24,596 --> 00:20:25,932
Always.

294
00:20:26,532 --> 00:20:28,232
But the town also knows

295
00:20:28,234 --> 00:20:31,271
what kind of a man
William Willoughby is.

296
00:20:32,338 --> 00:20:33,703
And the town is dead set

297
00:20:33,705 --> 00:20:36,706
against these billboards
of yours.

298
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:37,942
Took a poll,
did you, Father?

299
00:20:37,944 --> 00:20:41,212
If you hadn't stopped
coming to church,

300
00:20:41,214 --> 00:20:44,482
you'd have a little bit
more understanding

301
00:20:44,484 --> 00:20:46,416
of the depth
of people's feelings.

302
00:20:46,418 --> 00:20:50,320
More than a dozen people
came to me on Sunday.

303
00:20:50,322 --> 00:20:52,425
So, yes, I took a poll.

304
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:57,163
Everybody is with you
about Angela.

305
00:20:57,963 --> 00:21:00,166
Nobody is with you
about this.

306
00:21:05,838 --> 00:21:08,705
You know what I was
thinking about today?

307
00:21:08,707 --> 00:21:10,441
I was thinking
about those street gangs

308
00:21:10,443 --> 00:21:11,841
they have
down in Los Angeles,

309
00:21:11,843 --> 00:21:14,778
those Crips
and those Bloods.

310
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,480
And I was thinking about
that bunch of new laws

311
00:21:16,482 --> 00:21:17,647
they came up with

312
00:21:17,649 --> 00:21:19,617
in the 1980s,
I think it was,

313
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:24,088
to combat those street gangs,
those Crips and those Bloods.

314
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:25,388
And, if I remember rightly,

315
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:28,526
the gist of what those
new laws were saying was,

316
00:21:28,528 --> 00:21:30,161
if you join
one of these gangs,

317
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:32,863
and you're running
with them,

318
00:21:32,865 --> 00:21:35,232
and down the block one night,
unbeknownst to you,

319
00:21:35,234 --> 00:21:37,768
one of your fellow Crips,
or your fellow Bloods,

320
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:40,570
shoot up a place,
or stab a guy...

321
00:21:40,572 --> 00:21:42,639
Well then, even though

322
00:21:42,641 --> 00:21:44,241
you may not know
nothing about it

323
00:21:44,243 --> 00:21:47,845
and you were just standing
on a street corner

324
00:21:47,847 --> 00:21:49,847
minding your own business,

325
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:54,452
what these new laws said
was you're still culpable.

326
00:21:54,454 --> 00:21:56,819
You're still culpable
by the very act of having

327
00:21:56,821 --> 00:21:58,255
joined those Crips
and those Bloods

328
00:21:58,257 --> 00:22:00,257
in the first place.

329
00:22:00,259 --> 00:22:02,592
Which got me thinking,
Father,

330
00:22:02,594 --> 00:22:04,127
that whole
type of situation

331
00:22:04,129 --> 00:22:07,464
is kinda like you
church boys, ain't it?

332
00:22:07,466 --> 00:22:10,934
You got your colors,
you got your clubhouse.

333
00:22:10,936 --> 00:22:14,437
You're, for want
of a better word, a gang.

334
00:22:14,439 --> 00:22:15,905
And if you were upstairs

335
00:22:15,907 --> 00:22:17,907
smoking a pipe
and reading your Bible

336
00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:19,809
while one of your fellow
gang members

337
00:22:19,811 --> 00:22:22,713
is downstairs fucking
an altar boy, well...

338
00:22:22,715 --> 00:22:26,216
Father, just like those Crips,
and just like those Bloods,

339
00:22:26,218 --> 00:22:27,684
you're culpable.

340
00:22:27,686 --> 00:22:30,753
Because you joined
the gang, man.

341
00:22:30,755 --> 00:22:32,321
I don't care
if you never did shit,

342
00:22:32,323 --> 00:22:34,992
you never saw shit,
you never heard shit,

343
00:22:34,994 --> 00:22:39,195
you join the gang,
you're culpable.

344
00:22:39,197 --> 00:22:42,399
And when a person is culpable
to altar-boy-fucking,

345
00:22:42,401 --> 00:22:43,567
or any kinda boy-fucking,

346
00:22:43,569 --> 00:22:47,570
because I know you guys didn't
really narrow that down,

347
00:22:47,572 --> 00:22:50,007
then you kinda forfeit the
right to come into my house

348
00:22:50,009 --> 00:22:51,876
and say anything about me

349
00:22:51,878 --> 00:22:55,281
or my life, or my daughter,
or my billboards.

350
00:22:58,517 --> 00:23:01,184
So why don't you just finish
up your tea there, Father,

351
00:23:01,186 --> 00:23:03,255
and get the fuck
outta my kitchen.

352
00:23:14,065 --> 00:23:16,268
But thanks for coming up
anyway, Father.

353
00:23:21,072 --> 00:23:22,472
How you been
feeling, Bill?

354
00:23:24,009 --> 00:23:28,011
Ah, like I got cancer
in a major organ.

355
00:23:28,013 --> 00:23:31,147
Well, I just want you to know
we're all on your side

356
00:23:31,149 --> 00:23:33,250
about this
Mildred Hayes thing.

357
00:23:33,252 --> 00:23:37,190
If I have to hear that
one more fucking time...

358
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:43,196
I'm done with this shit.
I can't waste my life waiting.

359
00:23:45,732 --> 00:23:47,364
Stop reading
fucking comic books

360
00:23:47,366 --> 00:23:49,899
and get me the file
on the Hayes case.

361
00:23:49,901 --> 00:23:52,735
Angela Hayes case
or the Mildred Hayes case?

362
00:23:52,737 --> 00:23:54,871
There is no
Mildred Hayes case.

363
00:23:54,873 --> 00:23:56,405
We've had
two official complaints

364
00:23:56,407 --> 00:23:58,341
about those billboards,
so, actually...

365
00:23:58,343 --> 00:23:59,344
From who?

366
00:24:03,115 --> 00:24:05,585
There's a lady
with a funny eye

367
00:24:06,351 --> 00:24:08,086
and a fat dentist.

368
00:24:09,087 --> 00:24:13,156
Get me the file
on the Angela Hayes case.

369
00:24:13,158 --> 00:24:16,726
"Lady with
a funny fucking eye"?

370
00:24:16,728 --> 00:24:18,130
Jesus Christ.

371
00:24:31,609 --> 00:24:32,678
Late night?

372
00:24:35,613 --> 00:24:37,146
No.

373
00:24:37,148 --> 00:24:39,185
Lay off that Welby guy,
will you?

374
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:42,351
Or you'll do what?

375
00:24:42,353 --> 00:24:44,620
Kick your momma's
fucking teeth in.

376
00:24:44,622 --> 00:24:45,991
No, you won't.

377
00:24:48,461 --> 00:24:51,127
Who told you I was laying on him anyway?
The midget?

378
00:24:51,129 --> 00:24:53,931
What the fuck
are you talking about?

379
00:24:53,933 --> 00:24:55,898
And I'm trying
to fucking concentrate.

380
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,269
Fucking midgets!

381
00:25:22,061 --> 00:25:23,663
What you looking for
anyway?

382
00:25:26,165 --> 00:25:28,234
There's nothing
to look for.

383
00:25:30,836 --> 00:25:33,503
I don't know what it is.

384
00:25:33,505 --> 00:25:35,571
It feels like
it's kinda waggling.

385
00:25:35,573 --> 00:25:38,677
Well, if it's waggling,
it's gonna have to come out.

386
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,016
Ain't you gonna
take a look at it first?

387
00:25:45,684 --> 00:25:47,286
It's gonna have to come out.

388
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:54,494
Can I get a little
Novocaine there, doc?

389
00:26:10,909 --> 00:26:12,445
Give it a couple
of minutes.

390
00:26:27,892 --> 00:26:30,161
There's a lot
of good friends

391
00:26:30,163 --> 00:26:31,861
of Bill Willoughby
in this town.

392
00:26:31,863 --> 00:26:33,931
No! Ow! Stop! No!

393
00:26:36,534 --> 00:26:38,271
God damn it!

394
00:26:44,743 --> 00:26:46,710
Then why don't you tell
those good friends

395
00:26:46,712 --> 00:26:47,778
of Bill Willoughby

396
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:50,583
to tell him to go do his
fucking job, fat boy.

397
00:27:05,097 --> 00:27:07,097
Hey, Mildred.

398
00:27:07,099 --> 00:27:08,799
You didn't happen
to pay a visit

399
00:27:08,801 --> 00:27:10,166
to the dentist today,
did you?

400
00:27:10,168 --> 00:27:11,902
- No.
- Huh?

401
00:27:11,904 --> 00:27:13,302
I said "no".

402
00:27:13,304 --> 00:27:16,705
So it wasn't you
who drilled a little hole

403
00:27:16,707 --> 00:27:21,077
in one of big fat Geoffrey's
big fat thumbnails, no?

404
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:23,046
- Of course not.
- Huh?

405
00:27:23,048 --> 00:27:24,947
I said "of course not".

406
00:27:24,949 --> 00:27:27,084
You drilled a hole
in the dentist?

407
00:27:27,086 --> 00:27:28,385
Denise, no, I didn't.

408
00:27:28,387 --> 00:27:30,319
I thought it was
kinda funny myself,

409
00:27:30,321 --> 00:27:32,856
but he wants
to press charges,

410
00:27:32,858 --> 00:27:35,861
so we're gonna have to
bring you in, I'm afraid.

411
00:27:57,116 --> 00:27:58,248
So how's it all going

412
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:00,416
in the nigger-torturing
business, Dixon?

413
00:28:00,418 --> 00:28:04,186
It's persons-of-color-torturing
business, these days.

414
00:28:04,188 --> 00:28:07,560
If you wanna know,
I didn't torture nobody.

415
00:28:09,294 --> 00:28:10,394
What's the matter
with you,

416
00:28:10,396 --> 00:28:13,195
saying that
goddamn stuff on TV?

417
00:28:13,197 --> 00:28:15,130
My momma watches
that station.

418
00:28:15,132 --> 00:28:16,665
She doesn't know
about the torturing?

419
00:28:16,667 --> 00:28:19,336
No. She's against
that kinda thing.

420
00:28:19,338 --> 00:28:20,537
Who's against what?

421
00:28:20,539 --> 00:28:23,339
My momma is against
persons-of-color-torturing.

422
00:28:23,341 --> 00:28:24,808
She said
"nigger-torturing".

423
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:26,842
I said, "You can't say
'nigger-torturing' no more.

424
00:28:26,844 --> 00:28:29,412
"You gotta say
persons-of-color-torturing."

425
00:28:29,414 --> 00:28:30,750
Isn't that right, Chief?

426
00:28:31,282 --> 00:28:32,651
Ain't that right?

427
00:28:35,353 --> 00:28:39,188
I think I'll be able to
take care of Mrs. Hayes

428
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:41,626
on my own
from here on, Jason.

429
00:28:46,698 --> 00:28:48,833
Sure, Chief.
I'll be right outside.

430
00:29:00,846 --> 00:29:02,846
Don't give me that look.

431
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:06,849
If you got rid of every cop
with vaguely racist leanings,

432
00:29:06,851 --> 00:29:08,918
you'd have three cops left,

433
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,320
and all of them are gonna
hate the fags.

434
00:29:11,322 --> 00:29:13,790
So what are you gonna do,
you know?

435
00:29:15,994 --> 00:29:18,094
I wanna know something,
Mildred.

436
00:29:18,096 --> 00:29:19,663
Why did you drill a hole

437
00:29:19,665 --> 00:29:22,732
through poor fat
Geoffrey's thumbnail?

438
00:29:22,734 --> 00:29:24,733
That did not happen.

439
00:29:24,735 --> 00:29:26,203
His hand slipped.

440
00:29:26,205 --> 00:29:28,806
He drilled a hole
through his own self.

441
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:30,206
Did he say I did it?

442
00:29:30,208 --> 00:29:32,008
I guess it's his word

443
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:34,011
against mine, then, huh?

444
00:29:34,013 --> 00:29:36,812
Kinda like in all those
rape cases you hear about.

445
00:29:36,814 --> 00:29:39,782
Except, this time,
the chick ain't losing.

446
00:29:39,784 --> 00:29:42,019
It ain't really about winning
or losing, though,

447
00:29:42,021 --> 00:29:44,154
is it, Mildred?

448
00:29:44,156 --> 00:29:47,257
You think I care about
who wins or loses

449
00:29:47,259 --> 00:29:48,992
between the two of youse?

450
00:29:48,994 --> 00:29:51,261
You think
I care about dentists?

451
00:29:51,263 --> 00:29:53,230
I don't care about
dentists.

452
00:29:53,232 --> 00:29:55,434
Nobody cares
about dentists.

453
00:29:56,368 --> 00:29:59,472
What I do care about,
or what I'm

454
00:30:00,237 --> 00:30:02,673
interested in

455
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:05,776
is tying you up
in court so long

456
00:30:05,778 --> 00:30:08,043
that your hours
at the gift shop

457
00:30:08,045 --> 00:30:10,380
be so shot to shit

458
00:30:10,382 --> 00:30:12,281
that you ain't gonna
have a penny

459
00:30:12,283 --> 00:30:14,820
to pay for another
month's billboards.

460
00:30:15,654 --> 00:30:18,186
That's what
I'm interested in.

461
00:30:18,188 --> 00:30:19,822
I got some dough
put away.

462
00:30:19,824 --> 00:30:22,125
But what I heard was
you had to sell off

463
00:30:22,127 --> 00:30:23,559
your ex-husband's
tractor-trailer

464
00:30:23,561 --> 00:30:27,032
to even pay for this month's
billboards, that right?

465
00:30:28,167 --> 00:30:30,733
How is old Charlie,
by the way?

466
00:30:30,735 --> 00:30:34,069
He still shacked up with
that pretty little intern

467
00:30:34,071 --> 00:30:35,271
works down at the zoo?

468
00:30:35,273 --> 00:30:38,008
Still shacked up with some
chick smells of shit.

469
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:40,176
I don't know if the zoo's
got anything to do with it.

470
00:30:40,178 --> 00:30:42,044
Although I'd hope so.

471
00:30:44,581 --> 00:30:47,216
How old is she?
Nineteen?

472
00:30:47,218 --> 00:30:49,452
That must smart.

473
00:30:49,454 --> 00:30:52,821
Keep trying.
Keep trying.

474
00:30:52,823 --> 00:30:56,026
What's Charlie think about
these billboards of yours,

475
00:30:56,028 --> 00:30:57,894
an ex-cop like Charlie?

476
00:30:57,896 --> 00:30:59,163
Ex-cop, ex-wife-beater.

477
00:30:59,165 --> 00:31:00,463
Same difference,
I guess, right?

478
00:31:00,465 --> 00:31:03,436
His word against yours,
though, right?

479
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:07,570
Charlie don't know
about them, does he?

480
00:31:07,572 --> 00:31:09,172
It's none of his business.

481
00:31:09,174 --> 00:31:10,907
He's kinda paying
for them, though.

482
00:31:10,909 --> 00:31:12,242
I'm paying for them!

483
00:31:12,244 --> 00:31:13,376
This month you are.

484
00:31:13,378 --> 00:31:15,648
How about when...

485
00:31:20,918 --> 00:31:22,050
I didn't mean to...

486
00:31:22,052 --> 00:31:23,185
I know.

487
00:31:23,187 --> 00:31:24,319
It was an accident.

488
00:31:24,321 --> 00:31:25,590
I know, baby.

489
00:31:26,225 --> 00:31:27,659
It's blood.

490
00:31:30,227 --> 00:31:33,062
I'm gonna go
get somebody.

491
00:31:33,064 --> 00:31:34,966
Hey!

492
00:31:36,068 --> 00:31:37,267
Just let her go.

493
00:31:37,269 --> 00:31:38,501
Come on, Chief.

494
00:31:38,503 --> 00:31:40,539
Just let her go!

495
00:31:44,542 --> 00:31:46,411
Easy, easy, easy.

496
00:31:50,349 --> 00:31:51,583
Hey...

497
00:32:13,105 --> 00:32:14,404
Do birds get cancer?

498
00:32:14,406 --> 00:32:15,973
Huh?

499
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:18,074
Birds. Do they get cancer?

500
00:32:18,076 --> 00:32:20,443
I don't know. Dogs do.

501
00:32:20,445 --> 00:32:23,581
Yeah, well, I wasn't talking
about dogs, was I?

502
00:32:29,588 --> 00:32:33,290
Great, the good old "Raped
While Dying" ride home.

503
00:32:33,292 --> 00:32:34,957
If there was two seconds
in a day

504
00:32:34,959 --> 00:32:38,094
when I wasn't thinking
about how she died...

505
00:32:38,096 --> 00:32:41,164
"Think about it some more,
why don't you?"

506
00:32:41,166 --> 00:32:43,465
As much as
a person might have

507
00:32:43,467 --> 00:32:46,403
tried to avoid the details
of what happened

508
00:32:46,405 --> 00:32:48,271
because he didn't think
it would do any good,

509
00:32:48,273 --> 00:32:50,240
and he couldn't
bear it,

510
00:32:50,242 --> 00:32:53,976
it's also good to be informed
in 20-foot-high font

511
00:32:53,978 --> 00:32:57,813
the precise details
of her last moments.

512
00:32:57,815 --> 00:33:00,684
That it wasn't enough
that she was raped

513
00:33:00,686 --> 00:33:03,552
and it wasn't enough
that she died, no.

514
00:33:03,554 --> 00:33:06,455
"Raped While Dying."

515
00:33:06,457 --> 00:33:07,892
Thank you, Mom.

516
00:33:09,561 --> 00:33:11,895
I gave you
the police reports.

517
00:33:11,897 --> 00:33:13,963
I didn't read them.

518
00:33:13,965 --> 00:33:17,235
I'm depressed enough
as it fucking is.

519
00:33:57,509 --> 00:33:59,209
<i>Mom?</i>

520
00:33:59,211 --> 00:34:00,376
<i>Yeah?</i>

521
00:34:00,378 --> 00:34:02,478
<i>You ain't going out
again tonight, are you?</i>

522
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,681
Denise and I are gonna
grab a couple of beers.

523
00:34:04,683 --> 00:34:05,982
Denise gonna be
driving you?

524
00:34:05,984 --> 00:34:08,650
Why don't you just
ask to borrow the car?

525
00:34:08,652 --> 00:34:11,054
- Can I borrow the car?
- No.

526
00:34:11,056 --> 00:34:12,021
Bitch!

527
00:34:12,023 --> 00:34:13,790
I will give you money
for a taxi

528
00:34:13,792 --> 00:34:15,657
if you ask nice
and don't call me a bitch.

529
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:17,960
Why make me ask if you
weren't gonna let me?

530
00:34:17,962 --> 00:34:18,929
It was funny.

531
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:20,529
And because you've been
smoking pot all day.

532
00:34:20,531 --> 00:34:22,632
- You are such a hypocrite.
- Hypocrite?

533
00:34:22,634 --> 00:34:24,366
- Yeah.
- How?

534
00:34:24,368 --> 00:34:26,402
Drove drunk
when we were kids.

535
00:34:26,404 --> 00:34:28,003
What are you
talking about?

536
00:34:28,005 --> 00:34:29,371
Daddy told me.

537
00:34:29,373 --> 00:34:30,639
When did you see him?

538
00:34:30,641 --> 00:34:32,041
Don't change the subject.

539
00:34:32,043 --> 00:34:35,378
Did you drive drunk with us
in the car when we were kids?

540
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,579
Once, maybe.

541
00:34:36,581 --> 00:34:37,947
Okay, once?

542
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:39,514
When he was in the middle
of beating the shit out of me.

543
00:34:39,516 --> 00:34:41,183
Which we've only
got your word about!

544
00:34:41,185 --> 00:34:42,719
Angela, for Christ sakes.

545
00:34:42,721 --> 00:34:44,721
Why are you
never on my side?

546
00:34:44,723 --> 00:34:46,456
I'm always on your side when
you're not being a cunt!

547
00:34:46,458 --> 00:34:47,623
Hey!

548
00:34:47,625 --> 00:34:49,458
There will be no more
"cunts" in this house.

549
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,728
Are you moving out?

550
00:34:51,295 --> 00:34:52,998
It was a gag.

551
00:34:54,699 --> 00:34:56,933
Are you gonna let me
borrow the car or what?

552
00:34:56,935 --> 00:34:59,668
Why don't you
just walk, Angela?

553
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:02,672
You know what?
I will walk.

554
00:35:02,674 --> 00:35:06,675
And you know what else?
I hope I get raped on the way!

555
00:35:06,677 --> 00:35:08,947
I hope you do too!

556
00:35:23,594 --> 00:35:25,962
<i>Gonna need to keep you
in a few days, Bill.</i>

557
00:35:25,964 --> 00:35:28,331
<i>You shouldn't be
coughing up blood.</i>

558
00:35:28,333 --> 00:35:31,701
Yeah, I kinda
guessed that, Doc.

559
00:35:31,703 --> 00:35:33,902
I'll swing by
in the morning.

560
00:35:33,904 --> 00:35:34,973
Anne.

561
00:35:39,511 --> 00:35:42,378
I guess I'll go
get your coat, huh?

562
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,313
Well, you know
I ain't staying.

563
00:35:44,315 --> 00:35:45,916
You know
I ain't arguing.

564
00:36:39,003 --> 00:36:40,105
Oops.

565
00:36:46,712 --> 00:36:48,112
You old cunt.

566
00:36:49,313 --> 00:36:50,746
I'm not old, Robbie.

567
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:53,317
That's Dad.

568
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,454
Hey, Dad.
How's it going?

569
00:36:58,456 --> 00:36:59,825
Where's the crazy lady?

570
00:37:06,864 --> 00:37:09,398
Kid has got Rice fucking
Krispies in his fucking hair.

571
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,366
What's going on?

572
00:37:10,368 --> 00:37:12,835
What's going on with these
fucking billboards?

573
00:37:12,837 --> 00:37:14,538
Kinda self-explanatory.

574
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:17,206
Why don't you
explain it to me?

575
00:37:17,208 --> 00:37:20,675
Guess it ain't
self-explanatory, then.

576
00:37:20,677 --> 00:37:23,579
I wanted certain
people's minds

577
00:37:23,581 --> 00:37:25,815
kept on certain
people's jobs, is all.

578
00:37:25,817 --> 00:37:28,083
Hadn't heard from them
in seven goddamn months.

579
00:37:28,085 --> 00:37:30,686
I've heard an awful lot
from them

580
00:37:30,688 --> 00:37:32,154
since I put them
billboards up.

581
00:37:32,156 --> 00:37:34,657
You think this has
focused their minds? Mmm?

582
00:37:34,659 --> 00:37:38,126
It's focused their minds
on how exactly

583
00:37:38,128 --> 00:37:39,395
are they gonna
fuck you up.

584
00:37:39,397 --> 00:37:41,396
The more you keep a case
in the public eye,

585
00:37:41,398 --> 00:37:44,032
the better your chances
are of getting it solved.

586
00:37:44,034 --> 00:37:45,967
It's in
all the guidebooks.

587
00:37:45,969 --> 00:37:47,969
How much
these billboards cost?

588
00:37:47,971 --> 00:37:49,572
About the same
as a tractor-trailer.

589
00:37:50,708 --> 00:37:52,041
What the fuck
are you laughing at?

590
00:37:52,043 --> 00:37:52,909
Nothing.

591
00:37:52,911 --> 00:37:54,009
Laughed at by a guy

592
00:37:54,011 --> 00:37:55,712
with fucking cereal
in his hair.

593
00:37:55,714 --> 00:37:57,313
How's Penelope?

594
00:37:57,315 --> 00:37:58,715
Huh? She's all right.

595
00:37:58,717 --> 00:38:00,148
Why don't you
invite her in?

596
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,784
Save leaving her
sitting out there.

597
00:38:01,786 --> 00:38:03,920
- She here?
- She's out in the car.

598
00:38:03,922 --> 00:38:05,456
That explains it.

599
00:38:06,757 --> 00:38:07,989
That explains what?

600
00:38:07,991 --> 00:38:09,327
I know
I smelt something.

601
00:38:12,362 --> 00:38:13,630
Let her go!

602
00:38:13,632 --> 00:38:16,733
Oh! Um, I kinda need
to use the bathroom,

603
00:38:16,735 --> 00:38:17,900
but if it's inconvenient...

604
00:38:17,902 --> 00:38:20,136
Actually, it is
inconvenient, isn't it?

605
00:38:20,138 --> 00:38:21,471
I can hold it.
It's all right.

606
00:38:21,473 --> 00:38:22,871
It's the first door
down the hall.

607
00:38:22,873 --> 00:38:25,340
Sure? I feel like
I'm intruding.

608
00:38:25,342 --> 00:38:26,643
Just go pee.

609
00:38:26,645 --> 00:38:27,880
Oh.

610
00:38:45,763 --> 00:38:47,963
Look, you said
what you came to say.

611
00:38:47,965 --> 00:38:49,498
So why don't you go
get zoo girl

612
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,500
and get the hell out of
my house, all right?

613
00:38:51,502 --> 00:38:54,637
Um, actually, zoo-wise,
they were letting people go

614
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:55,804
at the zoo,
unfortunately,

615
00:38:55,806 --> 00:38:58,174
and it was a case of
"last in, first out". So...

616
00:38:58,176 --> 00:39:00,777
Unfortunately the zoo
had to let me go.

617
00:39:00,779 --> 00:39:01,911
But they were looking
for people

618
00:39:01,913 --> 00:39:05,047
down at the horse rides
for the disableds.

619
00:39:05,049 --> 00:39:06,849
So I'm working
down there now,

620
00:39:06,851 --> 00:39:09,221
looking after
the disableds' horses.

621
00:39:17,761 --> 00:39:19,395
Don't say a word.

622
00:39:19,397 --> 00:39:21,132
I wasn't gonna say a word.

623
00:39:23,601 --> 00:39:27,038
You don't think I don't wish
it had never happened?

624
00:39:30,375 --> 00:39:32,842
You don't think I don't wish
she was still here?

625
00:39:32,844 --> 00:39:34,880
I know you do.

626
00:39:36,281 --> 00:39:38,016
I know you do.

627
00:39:39,817 --> 00:39:43,386
Billboards ain't gonna
bring her back, Mildred.

628
00:39:43,388 --> 00:39:46,558
Neither is fucking
19-year-olds, Charlie.

629
00:39:48,326 --> 00:39:49,427
Yeah?

630
00:39:50,295 --> 00:39:52,063
But I know that.

631
00:39:53,764 --> 00:39:55,434
Just go.

632
00:39:56,567 --> 00:39:58,302
Yeah, all right.

633
00:39:59,036 --> 00:40:00,369
I'm such a shitty dad

634
00:40:00,371 --> 00:40:02,273
and you're such a great mom.
All right.

635
00:40:03,407 --> 00:40:06,442
So how come a week
before she died

636
00:40:06,444 --> 00:40:09,579
she's asking if she can move
in with me at my place?

637
00:40:09,581 --> 00:40:11,114
Couldn't stand you bitching

638
00:40:11,116 --> 00:40:12,982
and fighting
with each other no more.

639
00:40:12,984 --> 00:40:14,016
I don't believe you.

640
00:40:14,018 --> 00:40:18,121
I said, "Stay,
your mom loves you."

641
00:40:18,123 --> 00:40:22,257
Now I wish I hadn't.
She'd still fucking be here.

642
00:40:22,259 --> 00:40:23,659
I don't believe you!

643
00:40:23,661 --> 00:40:25,364
Don't believe me.

644
00:40:25,996 --> 00:40:28,065
Ask Froot Loop boy.

645
00:40:38,409 --> 00:40:39,478
Is that true?

646
00:40:41,511 --> 00:40:43,247
I don't know, Mom.

647
00:40:46,351 --> 00:40:48,119
Yeah, you do.

648
00:40:55,025 --> 00:40:56,358
<i>What's the matter?</i>

649
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,626
<i>Nothing.</i>

650
00:40:57,628 --> 00:41:01,063
Oh, come on,
not Donald Sutherland again.

651
00:41:01,065 --> 00:41:03,766
What is this, frickin'
Donald Sutherland season?

652
00:41:03,768 --> 00:41:05,934
I like him.
I like his hair.

653
00:41:05,936 --> 00:41:07,272
Hair?

654
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:10,840
This is the one
where his little girl dies.

655
00:41:10,842 --> 00:41:13,942
Always a plus in a movie.

656
00:41:13,944 --> 00:41:15,911
Talking of dead kids,

657
00:41:15,913 --> 00:41:18,181
what's happening
with the billboard lady?

658
00:41:18,183 --> 00:41:21,250
Oh, that kooz
won't listen to reason.

659
00:41:21,252 --> 00:41:23,251
She's tough as an old boot.

660
00:41:23,253 --> 00:41:24,454
Oh...

661
00:41:24,456 --> 00:41:26,054
Why don't you just
fuck her over

662
00:41:26,056 --> 00:41:27,558
through her friends then?

663
00:41:29,259 --> 00:41:30,192
Huh?

664
00:41:30,194 --> 00:41:32,795
You know, why don't you
fuck her friends over?

665
00:41:32,797 --> 00:41:35,230
Bring her around
that way.

666
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:38,169
She got any friends
you can fuck over?

667
00:41:50,882 --> 00:41:52,684
Rat bastards.

668
00:42:02,661 --> 00:42:03,893
Hey, fuckhead!

669
00:42:03,895 --> 00:42:04,960
What?

670
00:42:04,962 --> 00:42:06,395
Don't say "what", Dixon,

671
00:42:06,397 --> 00:42:08,730
when she comes in
calling you a fuckhead.

672
00:42:08,732 --> 00:42:10,632
- And don't you...
- Shut up!

673
00:42:10,634 --> 00:42:12,835
You, get over here.

674
00:42:12,837 --> 00:42:16,337
No! You, get over here.

675
00:42:16,339 --> 00:42:17,440
All right.

676
00:42:17,442 --> 00:42:19,275
What? Dixon!

677
00:42:19,277 --> 00:42:21,444
You do not allow a member
of the public

678
00:42:21,446 --> 00:42:23,311
to call you a fuckhead
in the station house!

679
00:42:23,313 --> 00:42:25,614
I'm taking care of it
in my own way.

680
00:42:25,616 --> 00:42:27,550
Now get out of my ass.

681
00:42:27,552 --> 00:42:30,887
Mrs. Hayes, have a seat.
What can I do for you today?

682
00:42:30,889 --> 00:42:32,389
Where's Denise Watson?

683
00:42:32,391 --> 00:42:33,922
In the clanger.

684
00:42:33,924 --> 00:42:35,824
- On what charge?
- Possession.

685
00:42:35,826 --> 00:42:36,992
Of what?

686
00:42:36,994 --> 00:42:38,661
Two marijuana cigarettes.

687
00:42:38,663 --> 00:42:39,996
Big ones.

688
00:42:39,998 --> 00:42:41,264
When is the bail hearing?

689
00:42:41,266 --> 00:42:43,766
I asked the judge
not to give her bail

690
00:42:43,768 --> 00:42:46,636
on account of her previous
marijuana violations,

691
00:42:46,638 --> 00:42:48,070
and the judge said "sure."

692
00:42:48,072 --> 00:42:49,340
You fucking prick!

693
00:42:53,277 --> 00:42:55,945
You do not call an officer
of the law a fucking prick

694
00:42:55,947 --> 00:42:58,280
in his own station house,
Mrs. Hayes.

695
00:42:58,282 --> 00:43:00,051
Or anywhere, actually.

696
00:43:01,286 --> 00:43:03,753
What's with the new
attitude, Dixon?

697
00:43:03,755 --> 00:43:05,757
Your momma
been coaching you?

698
00:43:07,491 --> 00:43:08,560
No.

699
00:43:09,393 --> 00:43:10,759
My momma

700
00:43:10,761 --> 00:43:12,096
doesn't do that.

701
00:43:14,799 --> 00:43:17,101
Take them down,
you hear me?

702
00:43:18,668 --> 00:43:20,270
You did good, Dixon.

703
00:43:20,272 --> 00:43:22,273
Yeah, I know I did.

704
00:43:25,643 --> 00:43:27,842
Almost got that.

705
00:43:27,844 --> 00:43:30,311
The rules here are twofold.

706
00:43:30,313 --> 00:43:33,916
No kid can leave
this goddamn blanket

707
00:43:33,918 --> 00:43:36,219
at any goddamn time.

708
00:43:36,221 --> 00:43:38,186
And every single one

709
00:43:38,188 --> 00:43:40,956
of these dolls
and these teddy bears

710
00:43:40,958 --> 00:43:43,259
has got to be hooked up.

711
00:43:43,261 --> 00:43:45,128
Now, your momma and I,

712
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:46,561
although it won't
look like it,

713
00:43:46,563 --> 00:43:50,333
we'll be watching
every goddamn move you make.

714
00:43:50,335 --> 00:43:53,503
So the most important thing
while we are watching you

715
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:57,907
is that you do not
leave this blanket.

716
00:43:57,909 --> 00:44:03,244
Next most important thing,
you do not at any stage

717
00:44:03,246 --> 00:44:05,313
allow the fishing rods

718
00:44:05,315 --> 00:44:09,050
to stick into you
or your sister's eyeballs,

719
00:44:09,052 --> 00:44:11,786
as this would be
counter-productive

720
00:44:11,788 --> 00:44:14,223
to the entire operation.

721
00:44:14,225 --> 00:44:15,657
What would it be?

722
00:44:15,659 --> 00:44:20,896
Counter-productive
to the entire operation.

723
00:44:20,898 --> 00:44:22,634
Then, troops,

724
00:44:25,869 --> 00:44:27,438
start fishing.

725
00:44:30,475 --> 00:44:32,407
We are not.

726
00:44:32,409 --> 00:44:33,878
We are.

727
00:44:35,947 --> 00:44:37,215
Yes.

728
00:45:17,956 --> 00:45:19,624
Hey, baby.

729
00:45:24,027 --> 00:45:27,398
Yeah,
still no arrests.

730
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:32,835
How come, I wonder?

731
00:45:32,837 --> 00:45:34,770
Because there ain't no God,
the whole world's empty,

732
00:45:34,772 --> 00:45:37,308
and it doesn't matter
what we do to each other?

733
00:45:39,911 --> 00:45:41,646
I hope not.

734
00:45:47,217 --> 00:45:48,617
How come
you came up here

735
00:45:48,619 --> 00:45:50,922
outta nowhere
looking so pretty?

736
00:45:52,522 --> 00:45:53,790
You ain't trying
to make me believe

737
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:56,791
in reincarnation
or something, are you?

738
00:45:56,793 --> 00:45:59,598
Because you're pretty,
but you ain't her.

739
00:46:00,998 --> 00:46:03,032
She got killed,

740
00:46:03,034 --> 00:46:05,237
and now she's dead forever.

741
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:09,608
I do thank you
for coming though.

742
00:46:11,743 --> 00:46:14,076
If I had some food
I'd give it to you.

743
00:46:14,078 --> 00:46:15,545
All I got is some Doritos.

744
00:46:15,547 --> 00:46:18,780
They might kill you,
they're kind of pointy.

745
00:46:18,782 --> 00:46:20,652
Then where would we be?

746
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:40,103
Yeah, so I, uh,
just happened to be looking

747
00:46:40,105 --> 00:46:43,905
over our contract that we
drew up back that time.

748
00:46:43,907 --> 00:46:45,840
What I realized was I...

749
00:46:45,842 --> 00:46:49,277
I realized that although
payment is to be made

750
00:46:49,279 --> 00:46:50,779
on the first day
of each month,

751
00:46:50,781 --> 00:46:54,650
the first payment you paid
was actually a deposit.

752
00:46:54,652 --> 00:46:56,686
Wasn't it?
It's like we said.

753
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:57,887
So, actually,
in point of fact,

754
00:46:57,889 --> 00:47:00,922
you're actually behind
in your payments now,

755
00:47:00,924 --> 00:47:03,291
by, yeah, a month.

756
00:47:03,293 --> 00:47:04,860
Yeah, that's, uh...

757
00:47:04,862 --> 00:47:09,498
It's what the contract says,
looking over it and all.

758
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:12,300
The lawyer says so too.

759
00:47:12,302 --> 00:47:14,538
When you need
this next payment by, Red?

760
00:47:16,873 --> 00:47:18,375
Well, now, really.

761
00:47:21,413 --> 00:47:24,315
Or by... Uh...

762
00:47:25,081 --> 00:47:26,282
Friday?

763
00:47:26,284 --> 00:47:28,083
Wow.

764
00:47:28,085 --> 00:47:29,585
When you can't
trust the lawyers

765
00:47:29,587 --> 00:47:30,686
and the advertising men,

766
00:47:30,688 --> 00:47:33,288
what the hell's America
coming to, huh?

767
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:35,190
Who got to you, Red?

768
00:47:35,192 --> 00:47:36,891
Willoughby?

769
00:47:36,893 --> 00:47:38,126
Nobody got to me.

770
00:47:38,128 --> 00:47:39,797
My fat fucking ass.

771
00:47:42,266 --> 00:47:43,898
He's dying, Mildred.

772
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:46,469
We're all fucking dying!

773
00:47:46,471 --> 00:47:48,270
Hi, Pamela.
We're a little bit busy

774
00:47:48,272 --> 00:47:50,105
at the moment,
if that's okay.

775
00:47:50,107 --> 00:47:51,607
I know you were
real anxious

776
00:47:51,609 --> 00:47:53,041
about talking to Mrs. Hayes
this morning...

777
00:47:53,043 --> 00:47:54,009
Anxious? No.

778
00:47:54,011 --> 00:47:57,212
No need to be, because
you won't believe it!

779
00:47:57,214 --> 00:48:00,416
A little Mexican delivery boy
just dropped in with this.

780
00:48:00,418 --> 00:48:01,650
What the hell is this?

781
00:48:01,652 --> 00:48:02,583
I know!

782
00:48:02,585 --> 00:48:04,822
It's $5,000! And guess
what the note says?

783
00:48:06,089 --> 00:48:08,857
It says to pay for the rental
on Mrs. Hayes's billboards.

784
00:48:08,859 --> 00:48:11,259
Can you believe it?
That's why I butted in.

785
00:48:11,261 --> 00:48:12,393
Who's it from?

786
00:48:12,395 --> 00:48:13,762
Doesn't say.

787
00:48:13,764 --> 00:48:16,331
- Well, where's the delivery boy?
- He went.

788
00:48:16,333 --> 00:48:18,103
Did you see what company
he was from?

789
00:48:18,735 --> 00:48:19,634
No.

790
00:48:19,636 --> 00:48:22,237
What kind of uniform
did he have on?

791
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:23,471
Well, he just looked
like one of those

792
00:48:23,473 --> 00:48:25,542
fat little Mexican boys.

793
00:48:26,076 --> 00:48:27,111
On a bicycle.

794
00:48:30,281 --> 00:48:31,480
Did I do
something wrong?

795
00:48:31,482 --> 00:48:33,148
No, Pam,
you did good.

796
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:35,416
Yeah, Pamela,
you did real good.

797
00:48:35,418 --> 00:48:37,585
Did I? Oh, great.

798
00:48:37,587 --> 00:48:40,090
Ain't life crazy?

799
00:48:45,196 --> 00:48:46,531
What's the note say, Red?

800
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:52,701
Says, "This here money
is to go towards the fund

801
00:48:52,703 --> 00:48:54,469
"for Mildred Hayes's
billboards,

802
00:48:54,471 --> 00:48:56,471
"because she ain't
the only one 'round here

803
00:48:56,473 --> 00:48:58,907
"who hates the pigs.
Signed, a friend."

804
00:48:58,909 --> 00:49:01,110
I guess you can't be too picky
about who your friends are

805
00:49:01,112 --> 00:49:02,113
these days, huh?

806
00:49:02,813 --> 00:49:04,913
Uh-huh, um...

807
00:49:04,915 --> 00:49:07,782
I guess I'll be needing
a receipt off you there, Red,

808
00:49:07,784 --> 00:49:09,617
you know, saying the price
of next month

809
00:49:09,619 --> 00:49:11,719
is paid in full and all.

810
00:49:11,721 --> 00:49:13,624
Oh, sure, Mildred, sure.

811
00:49:14,792 --> 00:49:15,858
Like now.

812
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:16,925
Oh, sure.

813
00:49:21,264 --> 00:49:22,898
Is Mommy drunk, Daddy?

814
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:25,733
No. She's just got a
little migraine, is all.

815
00:49:25,735 --> 00:49:27,969
Little Chardonnay
migraine.

816
00:49:27,971 --> 00:49:31,706
Now, no more chit-chat
outta you two, okay?

817
00:49:31,708 --> 00:49:34,809
Can we stay home from school
again tomorrow, Daddy?

818
00:49:34,811 --> 00:49:37,913
We'll see what your mommy
says in the morning, darling.

819
00:49:37,915 --> 00:49:39,313
Aw!

820
00:49:39,315 --> 00:49:41,453
Eyes closed

821
00:49:42,219 --> 00:49:44,656
and go to sleep, okay?

822
00:49:57,567 --> 00:50:01,335
You don't smell like puke,
which is good.

823
00:50:01,337 --> 00:50:04,239
Aquafresh.
Trick I learned.

824
00:50:04,241 --> 00:50:05,976
Women, huh?

825
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:09,811
But it's still your turn
to clean the horseshit

826
00:50:09,813 --> 00:50:11,346
outta the stable,
you know.

827
00:50:11,348 --> 00:50:14,449
Those fucking horses.

828
00:50:14,451 --> 00:50:15,951
They're your fucking horses.

829
00:50:15,953 --> 00:50:18,223
I'm gonna have those
fucking horses shot!

830
00:50:19,322 --> 00:50:23,157
I'll do it,
you lazy bitch.

831
00:50:23,159 --> 00:50:24,793
Thank you, Poppa.

832
00:50:27,665 --> 00:50:29,868
That was a real nice day.

833
00:50:31,601 --> 00:50:34,004
That was a real nice fuck.

834
00:50:37,107 --> 00:50:39,474
You got a real nice cock,
Mr. Willoughby.

835
00:50:44,014 --> 00:50:46,014
Is that from a play?

836
00:50:46,016 --> 00:50:48,050
"You got a real nice cock,
Mr. Willoughby."

837
00:50:48,052 --> 00:50:52,020
I think I heard that
in a Shakespeare one time.

838
00:50:52,022 --> 00:50:54,155
You dummy.

839
00:50:54,157 --> 00:50:56,027
It's Oscar Wilde.

840
00:50:56,761 --> 00:50:57,761
Ah.

841
00:51:51,415 --> 00:51:53,217
Oscar Wilde.

842
00:52:21,877 --> 00:52:23,645
<i>My darling Anne,</i>

843
00:52:23,647 --> 00:52:25,813
<i>there's a longer letter
in the dresser drawer</i>

844
00:52:25,815 --> 00:52:28,116
<i>I've been writing
for the last week or so.</i>

845
00:52:28,118 --> 00:52:31,853
<i>That one covers us
and my memories of us</i>

846
00:52:31,855 --> 00:52:34,355
<i>and how much
I've always loved you.</i>

847
00:52:34,357 --> 00:52:39,128
<i>This one just covers tonight,
and more importantly, today.</i>

848
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:42,197
<i>Tonight I've gone out
to the horses to end it.</i>

849
00:52:42,199 --> 00:52:44,933
<i>I cannot say sorry
for the act itself,</i>

850
00:52:44,935 --> 00:52:46,735
<i>although I know
that for a short time</i>

851
00:52:46,737 --> 00:52:49,070
<i>you will be angry at me
or even hate me for it.</i>

852
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:51,773
<i>Please don't.</i>

853
00:52:51,775 --> 00:52:55,076
<i>This is not a case of,
"I came in this world alone</i>

854
00:52:55,078 --> 00:52:56,478
<i>"and I'm going
out of it alone,"</i>

855
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,713
<i>or anything dumb like that.</i>

856
00:52:58,715 --> 00:53:01,116
<i>I did not come
in this world alone,</i>

857
00:53:01,118 --> 00:53:02,717
<i>my mom was there.</i>

858
00:53:02,719 --> 00:53:05,454
<i>And I am not
going out of it alone,</i>

859
00:53:05,456 --> 00:53:06,755
<i>because you are there,</i>

860
00:53:06,757 --> 00:53:11,826
<i>drunk on the couch,
making Oscar Wilde cock jokes.</i>

861
00:53:11,828 --> 00:53:14,963
<i>No, this is a case,
in some senses, of bravery.</i>

862
00:53:14,965 --> 00:53:17,699
<i>Not the bravery
of facing a bullet down.</i>

863
00:53:17,701 --> 00:53:19,166
<i>The next few months of pain</i>

864
00:53:19,168 --> 00:53:22,770
<i>would be far harder
than that small flash.</i>

865
00:53:22,772 --> 00:53:24,940
<i>No, it's the bravery
of weighing up</i>

866
00:53:24,942 --> 00:53:27,976
<i>the next few months
of still being with you,</i>

867
00:53:27,978 --> 00:53:32,181
<i>still waking up with you,
of playing with the kids</i>

868
00:53:32,183 --> 00:53:34,949
<i>against the next few months
of seeing in your eyes</i>

869
00:53:34,951 --> 00:53:37,652
<i>how much my pain
is killing you,</i>

870
00:53:37,654 --> 00:53:40,556
<i>how my weakened body,
as it ebbs away,</i>

871
00:53:40,558 --> 00:53:42,123
<i>and you tend to it,</i>

872
00:53:42,125 --> 00:53:45,828
<i>are your final and lasting
memories of me.</i>

873
00:53:45,830 --> 00:53:48,262
<i>I won't have that.</i>

874
00:53:48,264 --> 00:53:51,565
<i>Your final memories of me
will be us at the riverside</i>

875
00:53:51,567 --> 00:53:55,670
<i>and that dumb fishing game,
which I think they cheated at,</i>

876
00:53:55,672 --> 00:53:59,241
<i>and me inside of you
and you on top of me</i>

877
00:53:59,243 --> 00:54:04,480
<i>and barely a fleeting thought
of the darkness yet to come.</i>

878
00:54:04,482 --> 00:54:06,146
<i>That was the best, Anne.</i>

879
00:54:06,148 --> 00:54:09,585
<i>A whole day
of not thinking about it.</i>

880
00:54:09,587 --> 00:54:11,253
<i>Dwell on this day, baby,</i>

881
00:54:11,255 --> 00:54:14,590
<i>because it was the best day
of my life.</i>

882
00:54:14,592 --> 00:54:16,056
<i>Kiss the girls for me,</i>

883
00:54:16,058 --> 00:54:18,092
<i>and know that
I've always loved you,</i>

884
00:54:18,094 --> 00:54:21,029
<i>and maybe I'll see you again
if there's another place.</i>

885
00:54:21,031 --> 00:54:25,235
<i>And if there ain't, well,
it's been heaven knowing you.</i>

886
00:54:27,304 --> 00:54:28,906
<i>Your boy,</i>

887
00:54:30,273 --> 00:54:31,409
<i>Bill.</i>

888
00:55:27,163 --> 00:55:29,665
What the hell's
going on around here?

889
00:55:33,571 --> 00:55:34,839
What?

890
00:56:02,898 --> 00:56:04,835
Can you stand now?

891
00:56:05,601 --> 00:56:07,469
Yeah, I can stand.

892
00:56:10,706 --> 00:56:13,108
I'd better
get out there,

893
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:16,011
say something to them.

894
00:56:16,013 --> 00:56:18,215
You ain't gonna
faint again, are you?

895
00:56:45,976 --> 00:56:49,578
<i>I know
that the best thing,</i>

896
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:53,815
<i>the only thing to honor
that man's memory right now</i>

897
00:56:53,817 --> 00:56:55,518
<i>is to go to work.</i>

898
00:56:56,453 --> 00:56:59,357
<i>Is to be a good cop.</i>

899
00:57:00,857 --> 00:57:03,157
<i>To walk in his shoes</i>

900
00:57:03,159 --> 00:57:06,096
<i>and do what he did
every day of his life.</i>

901
00:57:06,864 --> 00:57:07,996
<i>Help people.</i>

902
00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:42,066
What the hell's going on?

903
00:57:59,049 --> 00:58:00,382
Where are you going, boy?

904
00:58:06,257 --> 00:58:09,961
You fucking pig!
What the fuck are you?

905
00:58:10,793 --> 00:58:12,263
Shut up.

906
00:58:32,982 --> 00:58:36,987
See, Red, I got issues
with white folks too.

907
00:58:43,226 --> 00:58:45,196
Fuck you looking at?

908
00:58:57,540 --> 00:59:00,474
<i>Reports,
sadly, have come in overnight,</i>

909
00:59:00,476 --> 00:59:03,043
<i>that Chief William Willoughby
of Ebbing, Missouri</i>

910
00:59:03,045 --> 00:59:05,346
<i>took his own life
early this morning</i>

911
00:59:05,348 --> 00:59:06,748
<i>in the grounds of his home.</i>

912
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:09,585
<i>This report just in
from Gabriella Forrester.</i>

913
00:59:09,587 --> 00:59:11,251
<i>Tragedy
came calling today</i>

914
00:59:11,253 --> 00:59:14,822
<i>upon this quiet family home
outside Ebbing, Missouri,</i>

915
00:59:14,824 --> 00:59:17,257
belonging to
Chief Willoughby,

916
00:59:17,259 --> 00:59:19,661
his wife, Anne,
their two young daughters,

917
00:59:19,663 --> 00:59:21,329
Polly and Jane.

918
00:59:21,331 --> 00:59:23,732
<i>What appears to be a
self-inflicted gunshot wound</i>

919
00:59:23,734 --> 00:59:26,268
<i>brought life to an end
for Chief Willoughby,</i>

920
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:28,270
<i>a man highly-respected
in Ebbing</i>

921
00:59:28,272 --> 00:59:31,271
<i>for his diligence
and service to the community.</i>

922
00:59:31,273 --> 00:59:33,041
<i>What led him to take his life</i>

923
00:59:33,043 --> 00:59:34,741
<i>in the early hours
of this morning,</i>

924
00:59:34,743 --> 00:59:36,844
<i>it is too early to speculate.</i>

925
00:59:36,846 --> 00:59:38,378
<i>There were rumors of illness.</i>

926
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:40,748
<i>Could it simply have been
the pressures of the job?</i>

927
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:43,518
<i>Or could it have something
to do with a story</i>

928
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:46,188
<i>we ran here
just two weeks ago</i>

929
00:59:46,190 --> 00:59:47,556

<i>Mildred Hayes?</i>

932
01:00:01,772 --> 01:00:03,373
Don't. Don't!

933
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:12,682
Hi, there.

934
01:00:13,917 --> 01:00:15,382
You know
who threw that can?

935
01:00:15,384 --> 01:00:16,386
What can?

936
01:00:19,255 --> 01:00:21,690
How about you, sweetheart?
You know who threw that can?

937
01:00:21,692 --> 01:00:23,123
Uh, no, I didn't see.

938
01:00:32,802 --> 01:00:33,804
Thank you, Mom.

939
01:00:45,581 --> 01:00:48,282
And what can I do
for you today, sir?

940
01:00:48,284 --> 01:00:49,652
What's your name?

941
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:55,190
Name's on my tag, man.
You hard of reading?

942
01:00:55,192 --> 01:00:57,458
Hard of reading?
No, no.

943
01:00:57,460 --> 01:00:58,960
That's good,
"hard of reading".

944
01:00:58,962 --> 01:01:00,328
Kinda like
"hard of hearing",

945
01:01:00,330 --> 01:01:02,663
but it's actually
"hard of reading".

946
01:01:02,665 --> 01:01:04,534
Like a play on words
or something, huh?

947
01:01:06,069 --> 01:01:07,302
What do you want?

948
01:01:07,304 --> 01:01:09,237
I've been sent
to take over

949
01:01:09,239 --> 01:01:11,172
from Chief Willoughby

950
01:01:11,174 --> 01:01:13,007
in light of last night's
unfortunate event.

951
01:01:13,009 --> 01:01:15,778
You have got to be
fucking kidding me!

952
01:01:17,547 --> 01:01:22,150
Do you have any documentation
to prove that, sir?

953
01:01:22,152 --> 01:01:24,652
You really wanna see
my documentation, fucker?

954
01:01:24,654 --> 01:01:29,159
Yeah, see his documentation!
Make him show it to you.

955
01:01:30,761 --> 01:01:33,496
None of you cracker motherfuckers
got no work to do?

956
01:01:37,132 --> 01:01:38,468
Ain't that racist?

957
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,974
What happened to your hand,
Officer Dixon?

958
01:01:45,976 --> 01:01:48,275
Oh, I just kinda

959
01:01:48,277 --> 01:01:49,576
banged it up
a little bit

960
01:01:49,578 --> 01:01:52,047
while I was throwing some guy
out a fucking window.

961
01:01:52,049 --> 01:01:53,882
You know, the usual.

962
01:01:53,884 --> 01:01:54,882
Yeah?

963
01:01:54,884 --> 01:01:57,552
They never taught me
that one at the academy.

964
01:01:57,554 --> 01:02:00,224
Which fucking academy
you go to?

965
01:02:01,891 --> 01:02:05,326
How are things coming along
on that Angela Hayes case?

966
01:02:05,328 --> 01:02:06,494
How's things coming along

967
01:02:06,496 --> 01:02:08,429
on the mind your own
fucking business case?

968
01:02:08,431 --> 01:02:09,764
How are things
coming along

969
01:02:09,766 --> 01:02:11,969
on the hand me your gun
and your badge?

970
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:17,139
Huh?

971
01:02:17,141 --> 01:02:19,976
Hand me your gun
and your badge.

972
01:02:39,128 --> 01:02:40,531
Shit.

973
01:02:54,143 --> 01:02:55,812
It's in here somewhere.

974
01:03:03,252 --> 01:03:06,219
Hey, listen,
I can't find my badge.

975
01:03:06,221 --> 01:03:08,290
No, seriously.
Maybe I lost it.

976
01:03:08,292 --> 01:03:10,358
Dropped it when I was
doing that window guy.

977
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:13,464
Just get the fuck out of
my station house, man.

978
01:03:38,221 --> 01:03:40,724
What's going on?

979
01:03:42,625 --> 01:03:45,492
I think I just got fired.

980
01:03:45,494 --> 01:03:47,996
Fired or suspended,
I'm not sure which.

981
01:03:47,998 --> 01:03:49,366
Fired.

982
01:04:19,728 --> 01:04:22,366
Anything I can help you with,
just give me a holler.

983
01:04:25,435 --> 01:04:28,471
Give Mildred Hayes

984
01:04:29,639 --> 01:04:30,907
a holler.

985
01:04:32,909 --> 01:04:34,078
Okay.

986
01:04:35,444 --> 01:04:37,177
You know me?

987
01:04:37,179 --> 01:04:40,384
Only from the TV
and the radio.

988
01:04:48,391 --> 01:04:49,523
How much these here

989
01:04:49,525 --> 01:04:51,759
"Welcome to Missouri"
rabbits go for?

990
01:04:51,761 --> 01:04:54,398
Seven bucks.
It's writ right on them.

991
01:05:02,471 --> 01:05:04,574
Guess he ain't
seven bucks now.

992
01:05:06,743 --> 01:05:08,275
What did you
come in here for?

993
01:05:08,277 --> 01:05:10,878
What did I
come in here for?

994
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:13,616
Maybe I'm a good friend of
Willoughby's, how about that?

995
01:05:14,683 --> 01:05:16,250
Are you?

996
01:05:16,252 --> 01:05:17,720
Or, you know...

997
01:05:19,755 --> 01:05:22,625
Maybe I was a friend of
your daughter or something.

998
01:05:23,393 --> 01:05:24,695
How about that?

999
01:05:27,330 --> 01:05:28,766
Were you?

1000
01:05:31,734 --> 01:05:32,969
Or, um...

1001
01:05:35,237 --> 01:05:36,503
You know,
maybe I was the one

1002
01:05:36,505 --> 01:05:39,107
who fucked her
while she was dying.

1003
01:05:39,109 --> 01:05:40,610
How about that?

1004
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:44,782
Were you?

1005
01:05:47,049 --> 01:05:48,151
No.

1006
01:05:49,451 --> 01:05:51,087
I would have liked to.

1007
01:05:52,589 --> 01:05:54,188
I saw her picture
in the paper there.

1008
01:05:58,293 --> 01:06:00,695
Saved by the bell, huh?

1009
01:06:00,697 --> 01:06:03,331
You owe me seven fucking
dollars for the rabbit.

1010
01:06:04,801 --> 01:06:06,300
Guess you'll have to
get it off me

1011
01:06:06,302 --> 01:06:07,835
next time
I'm passing through.

1012
01:06:07,837 --> 01:06:08,971
Guess I will.

1013
01:06:18,714 --> 01:06:21,416
You don't know how
glad I am to see you.

1014
01:06:21,418 --> 01:06:22,483
What?

1015
01:06:22,485 --> 01:06:24,018
That guy was
trying to scare me.

1016
01:06:24,020 --> 01:06:26,554
I wouldn't have said
you scare easy.

1017
01:06:26,556 --> 01:06:28,058
I ain't the worst.

1018
01:06:29,558 --> 01:06:31,558
What can I do
for you, ma'am?

1019
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:32,759
My husband
left this for you

1020
01:06:32,761 --> 01:06:35,465
before he shot himself
in the head last night.

1021
01:06:39,703 --> 01:06:41,268
I'm sorry,
Mrs. Willoughby...

1022
01:06:41,270 --> 01:06:42,605
Are you?

1023
01:06:43,272 --> 01:06:44,838
Are you really?

1024
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:47,976
- Sure, I am.
- Surely this is the perfect ending for you, isn't it?

1025
01:06:47,978 --> 01:06:51,212
Proof those billboards
of yours were successful,

1026
01:06:51,214 --> 01:06:53,047
a dead policeman?

1027
01:06:53,049 --> 01:06:54,549
It's quantifiable now.

1028
01:06:54,551 --> 01:06:55,916
Are you blaming
this on me?

1029
01:06:55,918 --> 01:06:57,451
No.

1030
01:06:57,453 --> 01:06:58,719
I'm not blaming
this on you.

1031
01:06:58,721 --> 01:07:00,791
I just came
to give you the letter.

1032
01:07:01,857 --> 01:07:03,757
Now my little girls
are out in the car,

1033
01:07:03,759 --> 01:07:06,629
so I'd better not
stay and chat.

1034
01:07:07,864 --> 01:07:09,329
I'm not quite sure
what we're gonna do

1035
01:07:09,331 --> 01:07:10,868
for the rest of the day.

1036
01:07:12,335 --> 01:07:14,569
It's hard to know
what to do

1037
01:07:14,571 --> 01:07:17,404
the day your husband
kills himself.

1038
01:07:17,406 --> 01:07:18,975
It's hard to know
what to do.

1039
01:07:48,871 --> 01:07:50,704
<i>Dear Mildred,</i>

1040
01:07:50,706 --> 01:07:52,773
<i>Dead Man Willoughby here.</i>

1041
01:07:52,775 --> 01:07:55,108
<i>Firstly, I wanted
to apologize for dying</i>

1042
01:07:55,110 --> 01:07:57,911
<i>without catching
your daughter's killer.</i>

1043
01:07:57,913 --> 01:07:59,646
<i>It's a source
of great pain to me,</i>

1044
01:07:59,648 --> 01:08:01,449
<i>and it would
break my heart to think</i>

1045
01:08:01,451 --> 01:08:05,319
<i>you thought I didn't care.
I did.</i>

1046
01:08:05,321 --> 01:08:06,987
<i>There are just some cases</i>

1047
01:08:06,989 --> 01:08:09,657
<i>where you never
catch a break,</i>

1048
01:08:09,659 --> 01:08:11,592
<i>then five years
down the line</i>

1049
01:08:11,594 --> 01:08:13,594
<i>some guy hears
some other guy</i>

1050
01:08:13,596 --> 01:08:17,532
<i>bragging about it
in a bar room or a jail cell</i>

1051
01:08:17,534 --> 01:08:19,134
<i>and the whole thing
is wrapped up</i>

1052
01:08:19,136 --> 01:08:20,935
<i>through sheer stupidity.</i>

1053
01:08:20,937 --> 01:08:24,537
<i>I hope that might be true
for Angela, I really do.</i>

1054
01:08:24,539 --> 01:08:27,207
<i>Second, I gotta admit,
Mildred,</i>

1055
01:08:27,209 --> 01:08:30,711
<i>the billboards were
a great fucking idea.</i>

1056
01:08:30,713 --> 01:08:32,846
<i>They were like a chess move.</i>

1057
01:08:32,848 --> 01:08:35,149
<i>And although they had
absolutely nothing</i>

1058
01:08:35,151 --> 01:08:36,684
<i>to do with my dying,</i>

1059
01:08:36,686 --> 01:08:38,418
<i>I'm sure that
everyone in town</i>

1060
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:40,220
<i>will assume that they did,</i>

1061
01:08:40,222 --> 01:08:42,790
<i>which is why, for
Willoughby's counter-move,</i>

1062
01:08:42,792 --> 01:08:45,826
<i>I decided to pay
the next month's rent on them.</i>

1063
01:08:45,828 --> 01:08:48,729
<i>I thought it would be funny,
you having to defend them</i>

1064
01:08:48,731 --> 01:08:49,896
<i>another whole month</i>

1065
01:08:49,898 --> 01:08:52,867
<i>after they've stuck me
in the ground.</i>

1066
01:08:52,869 --> 01:08:55,470
<i>The joke is on you,
Mildred, ha ha,</i>

1067
01:08:55,472 --> 01:08:57,641
<i>and I hope
they do not kill you.</i>

1068
01:08:58,574 --> 01:08:59,940
<i>So good luck with all that,</i>

1069
01:08:59,942 --> 01:09:02,779
<i>and good luck
with everything else too.</i>

1070
01:09:03,879 --> 01:09:06,782
<i>I hope and I pray
that you get him.</i>

1071
01:09:23,799 --> 01:09:27,734
Well, you want me to go
down and talk to them?

1072
01:09:27,736 --> 01:09:30,671
No, I don't want you to
go down and talk to them.

1073
01:09:30,673 --> 01:09:32,140
Somebody sending
their goddamn mother

1074
01:09:32,142 --> 01:09:34,211
down to talk
to the goddamn police?

1075
01:09:38,181 --> 01:09:39,546
To say what?

1076
01:09:39,548 --> 01:09:42,349
To say to give you
your job back.

1077
01:09:42,351 --> 01:09:43,887
Get rid
of that black guy.

1078
01:09:45,489 --> 01:09:46,887
Ain't gonna listen
to some guy's mother

1079
01:09:46,889 --> 01:09:49,092
asking them to get rid
of some black guy.

1080
01:09:50,026 --> 01:09:51,824
Things have moved on
in the South.

1081
01:09:51,826 --> 01:09:53,696
Well, it shouldn't have!

1082
01:09:55,164 --> 01:09:59,169
Will they give you some money
for being laid off and all?

1083
01:10:01,070 --> 01:10:03,170
I don't know what the
compensation scheme is

1084
01:10:03,172 --> 01:10:05,907
for when you throw a guy
out of a window, Ma.

1085
01:10:05,909 --> 01:10:07,641
Guess I should have
looked into that beforehand.

1086
01:10:07,643 --> 01:10:09,810
Let me Google that.

1087
01:10:09,812 --> 01:10:12,512
A couple of grand, maybe?

1088
01:10:12,514 --> 01:10:14,215
You been there three years.

1089
01:10:14,217 --> 01:10:18,155
Not counting the five years
at the academy.

1090
01:10:19,356 --> 01:10:20,653
Six,

1091
01:10:20,655 --> 01:10:22,993
if you count the year
you were held back.

1092
01:10:25,462 --> 01:10:27,528
Where are you going?

1093
01:10:27,530 --> 01:10:29,529
None of your business.

1094
01:10:29,531 --> 01:10:31,966
Off to see your fancy woman?

1095
01:10:31,968 --> 01:10:33,534
I don't got a fancy woman.

1096
01:10:33,536 --> 01:10:36,336
Yeah. I know.

1097
01:10:36,338 --> 01:10:38,773
Hey, you wanna
watch yourself.

1098
01:10:38,775 --> 01:10:41,011
Or, or you'll do what?

1099
01:10:44,347 --> 01:10:47,084
I'll blow your goddamn
head off, that's what.

1100
01:10:57,494 --> 01:10:59,092
Oh,
did you hear the news?

1101
01:10:59,094 --> 01:11:00,027
What news?

1102
01:11:00,029 --> 01:11:01,695
That Dixon guy
threw that Welby guy

1103
01:11:01,697 --> 01:11:03,864
out of his window
this morning.

1104
01:11:03,866 --> 01:11:05,435
You're shitting me.

1105
01:11:10,606 --> 01:11:12,305
Is he okay?

1106
01:11:12,307 --> 01:11:13,509
Mmm-mmm.

1107
01:11:18,513 --> 01:11:20,180
- You're shitting me!
- Whoa!

1108
01:11:20,182 --> 01:11:23,319
Holy shit!
Holy shit!

1109
01:11:23,753 --> 01:11:25,322
Holy shit!

1110
01:11:26,255 --> 01:11:27,324
Fuck!

1111
01:11:30,793 --> 01:11:32,192
Get the other one
from the house.

1112
01:11:32,194 --> 01:11:33,993
Shouldn't I call
the fire department?

1113
01:11:33,995 --> 01:11:36,463
Fuck them.
They probably started it.

1114
01:11:36,465 --> 01:11:38,134
Don't do anything stupid!

1115
01:11:39,502 --> 01:11:40,935
Scumbags!

1116
01:11:40,937 --> 01:11:43,340
Fucking, fucking scumbags!

1117
01:12:16,772 --> 01:12:18,206
Shit!

1118
01:12:18,208 --> 01:12:19,509
All right!

1119
01:12:41,530 --> 01:12:43,098
Are you kidding me?

1120
01:12:48,036 --> 01:12:50,173
What the hell
are you doing?

1121
01:12:58,080 --> 01:12:59,680
Okay. Good. Come on.

1122
01:12:59,682 --> 01:13:01,415
Leave it! Ma, please!

1123
01:13:01,417 --> 01:13:02,886
It's too late!

1124
01:13:06,054 --> 01:13:07,720
- Robbie...
- Leave it! Please!

1125
01:13:07,722 --> 01:13:09,158
Robbie!

1126
01:13:38,454 --> 01:13:40,089
How are those hands?

1127
01:13:41,991 --> 01:13:44,127
Give us a minute here.
Thank you.

1128
01:13:47,362 --> 01:13:49,262
Can I ask you
a couple of questions?

1129
01:13:49,264 --> 01:13:51,030
You can ask me all the
questions you want,

1130
01:13:51,032 --> 01:13:53,266
you take me down
and arrest me.

1131
01:13:53,268 --> 01:13:54,635
I'm not gonna arrest you,
Mrs. Hayes.

1132
01:13:54,637 --> 01:13:56,205
I got nothing
to arrest you for.

1133
01:13:58,641 --> 01:14:00,243
Not yet you ain't.

1134
01:14:06,281 --> 01:14:08,485
We ain't all the enemy,
you know.

1135
01:14:26,268 --> 01:14:30,205
I'll crucify
the motherfuckers.

1136
01:14:41,250 --> 01:14:43,149
What are
you gonna do, Mildred?

1137
01:14:43,151 --> 01:14:45,086
You gonna crucify them?

1138
01:14:45,088 --> 01:14:48,288
Yeah, I'm gonna crucify them.

1139
01:14:48,290 --> 01:14:50,390
Who you gonna crucify?

1140
01:14:50,392 --> 01:14:52,492
The motherfuckers?

1141
01:14:52,494 --> 01:14:54,628
Yeah, I'm gonna

1142
01:14:54,630 --> 01:14:57,064
crucify the motherfuckers.

1143
01:14:57,066 --> 01:14:59,132
Ooh, then those motherfuckers

1144
01:14:59,134 --> 01:15:02,336
better watch out, all right?

1145
01:15:05,674 --> 01:15:07,276
Fucking A.

1146
01:15:11,079 --> 01:15:12,546
What's this shit?

1147
01:15:12,548 --> 01:15:14,381
And as sad as the spectacle

1148
01:15:14,383 --> 01:15:16,483
of these burned out
billboards might be,

1149
01:15:16,485 --> 01:15:18,252
in light of the death
of Chief Willoughby,

1150
01:15:18,254 --> 01:15:19,820
this reporter for one

1151
01:15:19,822 --> 01:15:21,220
wonders if this
finally puts an end

1152
01:15:21,222 --> 01:15:23,791
to the strange saga
of the three billboards...

1153
01:15:23,793 --> 01:15:26,092
This doesn't put an end
to shit, you fucking retard,

1154
01:15:26,094 --> 01:15:27,728
this is just
the fucking start!

1155
01:15:27,730 --> 01:15:28,962
Why don't you
put that on your

1156
01:15:28,964 --> 01:15:32,201
<i>Good Morning Missouri</i> fucking
<i>Wake Up</i> broadcast, bitch!

1157
01:15:41,576 --> 01:15:44,244
I see on the TV there
were a bunch of fires

1158
01:15:44,246 --> 01:15:46,482
lit outside of town
last night.

1159
01:15:48,151 --> 01:15:49,753
Bunch of fires, huh?

1160
01:15:50,753 --> 01:15:53,023
Out at those billboards.

1161
01:15:54,557 --> 01:15:56,524
Back when I was a cop
I would have been

1162
01:15:56,526 --> 01:15:58,257
interested in
who set those fires,

1163
01:15:58,259 --> 01:16:00,293
because, technically,
that's arson,

1164
01:16:00,295 --> 01:16:02,195
but as I'm no longer
employed by those people,

1165
01:16:02,197 --> 01:16:04,732
I don't really
give a goddamn.

1166
01:16:07,636 --> 01:16:09,105
I'll get it.

1167
01:16:14,477 --> 01:16:15,576
Dixon residence.

1168
01:16:15,578 --> 01:16:17,545
<i>Hey, Dixon, it's Cedric.</i>

1169
01:16:17,547 --> 01:16:21,082
Oh, hey, Sarge.
You got any news?

1170
01:16:21,084 --> 01:16:23,219
- <i>News about what?</i>
- I don't know.

1171
01:16:25,087 --> 01:16:27,889
About my job and stuff?

1172
01:16:27,891 --> 01:16:30,257
No. No. What?

1173
01:16:30,259 --> 01:16:31,558
No.

1174
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:35,162
Anne Willoughby
just dropped in a letter

1175
01:16:35,164 --> 01:16:36,898
that Bill wrote you
before he died.

1176
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:38,299
What's it say?

1177
01:16:38,301 --> 01:16:40,967
I haven't read it,
it's not my letter.

1178
01:16:40,969 --> 01:16:42,903
Oh, well, listen,
I'll come right down.

1179
01:16:42,905 --> 01:16:45,538
Um, I'll be there
in like 15 minutes.

1180
01:16:45,540 --> 01:16:47,373
Well... Uh...

1181
01:16:47,375 --> 01:16:52,912
Not such a great idea,
things as they stand, Jason.

1182
01:16:52,914 --> 01:16:54,348
<i>You still got your keys</i>

1183
01:16:54,350 --> 01:16:56,516
<i>to the station house,
though, right?</i>

1184
01:16:56,518 --> 01:16:57,484
Yeah.

1185
01:16:57,486 --> 01:16:59,920
<i>Why don't you
come and pick it up</i>

1186
01:16:59,922 --> 01:17:02,256
<i>after everyone's gone home?</i>

1187
01:17:02,258 --> 01:17:04,494
<i>I can leave it
on your desk for you.</i>

1188
01:17:05,794 --> 01:17:07,193
Oh, okay.

1189
01:17:07,195 --> 01:17:08,730
<i>Actually, yeah, then</i>

1190
01:17:09,398 --> 01:17:11,534
when you're done, you can

1191
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:14,600
just leave the keys,

1192
01:17:14,602 --> 01:17:17,272
you know, save us
picking them up later.

1193
01:17:19,907 --> 01:17:21,244
All right.

1194
01:17:48,670 --> 01:17:50,970
<i>Jason, Willoughby here.</i>

1195
01:17:50,972 --> 01:17:53,439
<i>I'm dead now,
sorry about that.</i>

1196
01:17:53,441 --> 01:17:55,141
<i>There's something
I wanted to say to you</i>

1197
01:17:55,143 --> 01:17:57,646
<i>that I never really said
when I was alive.</i>

1198
01:17:59,114 --> 01:18:00,648
<i>I think you've got the makings</i>

1199
01:18:00,650 --> 01:18:03,717
<i>of being
a really good cop, Jason.</i>

1200
01:18:03,719 --> 01:18:05,187
<i>And you know why?</i>

1201
01:18:06,422 --> 01:18:10,323
<i>Because deep down
you're a decent man.</i>

1202
01:18:10,325 --> 01:18:12,393
<i>I know you don't think
I think that,</i>

1203
01:18:12,395 --> 01:18:14,429
<i>but I do, dipshit.</i>

1204
01:18:21,437 --> 01:18:23,907
<i>I do think
you're too angry, though.</i>

1205
01:18:26,542 --> 01:18:28,442
<i>And I know it's all
since your dad died,</i>

1206
01:18:28,444 --> 01:18:31,414
<i>and you had to go
look after your mom.</i>

1207
01:18:34,150 --> 01:18:37,283
<i>But as long as you hold on
to so much hate,</i>

1208
01:18:37,285 --> 01:18:40,086
<i>then I don't think
you're ever gonna become</i>

1209
01:18:40,088 --> 01:18:42,424
<i>what I know
you wanna become.</i>

1210
01:18:45,027 --> 01:18:46,560
<i>A detective.</i>

1211
01:18:52,701 --> 01:18:55,168
<i>Because you know what you
need to become a detective?</i>

1212
01:18:56,572 --> 01:18:59,073
<i>And I know you're gonna wince
when I say this...</i>

1213
01:19:00,976 --> 01:19:06,449
<i>But what you need to become
a detective is love.</i>

1214
01:19:07,182 --> 01:19:08,384
Fuck 'em.

1215
01:19:15,523 --> 01:19:18,192
<i>Because through love
comes calm,</i>

1216
01:19:18,194 --> 01:19:20,827
<i>and through calm
comes thought.</i>

1217
01:19:20,829 --> 01:19:24,701
<i>And you need thought to detect
stuff sometimes, Jason.</i>

1218
01:19:30,205 --> 01:19:32,238
<i>It's kinda all you need.</i>

1219
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:33,808
<i>You don't even need a gun.</i>

1220
01:19:33,810 --> 01:19:36,443
<i>And you definitely
don't need hate.</i>

1221
01:19:36,445 --> 01:19:38,414
<i>Hate never solved nothing.</i>

1222
01:19:43,451 --> 01:19:45,818
<i>But calm did.
And thought did.</i>

1223
01:19:45,820 --> 01:19:48,690
<i>Try it. Try it
just for a change.</i>

1224
01:19:50,392 --> 01:19:51,958
<i>No one will think
you're gay.</i>

1225
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:55,261
<i>And if they do,
arrest them for homophobia.</i>

1226
01:19:55,263 --> 01:19:58,299
<i>Won't they be surprised.</i>

1227
01:19:58,301 --> 01:20:01,400
<i>Good luck to you, Jason,
you're a decent man.</i>

1228
01:20:01,402 --> 01:20:04,273
<i>And yeah, you've had
a run of bad luck,</i>

1229
01:20:05,508 --> 01:20:08,978
<i>but things are gonna change for you.
I can feel it.</i>

1230
01:20:39,008 --> 01:20:40,076
Calm.

1231
01:20:41,142 --> 01:20:42,444
Calm.

1232
01:20:43,879 --> 01:20:44,947
Calm.

1233
01:22:05,861 --> 01:22:06,894
What did you see?

1234
01:22:06,896 --> 01:22:09,395
When we turned the corner
from Spring,

1235
01:22:09,397 --> 01:22:11,765
the fire was
already raging, and

1236
01:22:11,767 --> 01:22:13,900
about two seconds later
the cop fella,

1237
01:22:13,902 --> 01:22:15,269
he just jumps
out of the window.

1238
01:22:15,271 --> 01:22:19,142
Wait... The two of you turned
the corner from Spring?

1239
01:22:20,174 --> 01:22:21,442
Where were you
before this?

1240
01:22:21,444 --> 01:22:22,879
Round my place.

1241
01:22:25,815 --> 01:22:27,984
You two boyfriend
and girlfriend?

1242
01:22:30,419 --> 01:22:32,088
Early stages, you know.

1243
01:22:33,521 --> 01:22:35,055
Is that right?

1244
01:22:35,057 --> 01:22:36,726
We had a couple of dates.

1245
01:22:46,736 --> 01:22:49,071
You wanna go out to
dinner with me next week?

1246
01:22:50,405 --> 01:22:52,607
Yeah, I'll go out
to dinner with you.

1247
01:22:55,244 --> 01:22:56,879
But I ain't gonna
fuck you.

1248
01:22:57,879 --> 01:23:00,750
Well, I... I ain't gonna
fuck you neither.

1249
01:23:03,151 --> 01:23:04,620
I guess.

1250
01:23:18,968 --> 01:23:22,138
Burn victim. He's
pretty heavily sedated.

1251
01:23:31,446 --> 01:23:34,314
Hey, man.
You doing okay?

1252
01:23:34,316 --> 01:23:38,788
Jeez, you got burned up
pretty bad, huh?

1253
01:23:41,056 --> 01:23:42,792
You'll be okay though.

1254
01:23:43,825 --> 01:23:46,561
You want a glass
of orange juice?

1255
01:23:47,294 --> 01:23:48,929
I got a straw somewhere.

1256
01:23:50,331 --> 01:23:51,801
Hey, hey...

1257
01:23:52,901 --> 01:23:54,169
Don't cry.

1258
01:23:56,070 --> 01:23:57,806
You'll be okay.

1259
01:24:00,642 --> 01:24:02,712
I'm sorry, Welby.

1260
01:24:06,181 --> 01:24:07,280
You know me?

1261
01:24:07,282 --> 01:24:08,651
I'm sorry.

1262
01:24:11,053 --> 01:24:13,022
You're sorry for what?

1263
01:24:14,656 --> 01:24:16,691
Throwing you
out the window.

1264
01:24:24,232 --> 01:24:25,466
Sorry.

1265
01:24:25,468 --> 01:24:27,400
I don't care!

1266
01:24:27,402 --> 01:24:30,403
Stop fucking crying,
God damn it!

1267
01:24:30,405 --> 01:24:32,773
The salt will just
fuck up your wounds.

1268
01:24:32,775 --> 01:24:35,708
I thought it was
good for wounds.

1269
01:24:35,710 --> 01:24:37,914
What am I,
a fucking doctor?

1270
01:25:47,482 --> 01:25:48,814
Who is it?

1271
01:25:48,816 --> 01:25:50,919
Oh, you don't
know me really.

1272
01:25:53,688 --> 01:25:55,822
Well, what do you want?

1273
01:25:55,824 --> 01:25:58,158
I come about the billboards.

1274
01:25:58,160 --> 01:25:59,493
What about them?

1275
01:25:59,495 --> 01:26:01,060
They got burned up.

1276
01:26:01,062 --> 01:26:02,863
I know that.

1277
01:26:02,865 --> 01:26:05,935
I'm one of the guys who put
them up in the first place.

1278
01:26:09,570 --> 01:26:10,805
Jerome.

1279
01:26:12,606 --> 01:26:14,306
What can I do
for you, Jerome?

1280
01:26:14,308 --> 01:26:16,577
When you put up a bunch
of posters like that...

1281
01:26:16,579 --> 01:26:20,145
Just in case any of them get
screwed up or torn, they...

1282
01:26:20,147 --> 01:26:22,817
Give you a set of
duplicates, you know?

1283
01:26:23,785 --> 01:26:25,421
No, I didn't know that.

1284
01:26:33,995 --> 01:26:36,998
Ladder's pretty steady
as it is there, James.

1285
01:26:38,667 --> 01:26:41,201
That's okay.
I like holding ladders.

1286
01:26:41,203 --> 01:26:42,338
Takes me out of myself.

1287
01:26:47,609 --> 01:26:49,109
- Need a hand?
- Hey.

1288
01:26:50,145 --> 01:26:52,512
- When did you get out?
- An hour ago.

1289
01:26:52,514 --> 01:26:53,747
Judge threw it out.

1290
01:26:53,749 --> 01:26:55,381
Said the arrest report
weren't filled out right.

1291
01:26:55,383 --> 01:26:56,852
Mmm.

1292
01:26:57,352 --> 01:26:58,387
Say, you...

1293
01:27:02,124 --> 01:27:04,925
You didn't burn down the
police station, did you?

1294
01:27:04,927 --> 01:27:07,295
No, she was with me
the whole night.

1295
01:27:09,231 --> 01:27:11,398
- Why would you...
- It's a long story.

1296
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:12,902
Hey.

1297
01:27:13,235 --> 01:27:15,034
Hey.

1298
01:27:15,036 --> 01:27:16,702
Still wanna put up
the Willoughby one,

1299
01:27:16,704 --> 01:27:18,270
him being dead and all?

1300
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:20,674
Why not?
He paid for it.

1301
01:27:20,676 --> 01:27:21,977
True.

1302
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:36,292
Look at this
fucking asshole.

1303
01:28:11,726 --> 01:28:13,896
- First round is on you?
- Yeah.

1304
01:28:29,878 --> 01:28:31,413
Well, here we are.

1305
01:28:33,581 --> 01:28:35,183
Here we are.

1306
01:28:37,386 --> 01:28:38,885
I like cheesy things.

1307
01:28:38,887 --> 01:28:40,822
I'm gonna look
for cheesy things.

1308
01:28:41,757 --> 01:28:42,991
All right.

1309
01:28:49,763 --> 01:28:51,598
Who's that?

1310
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:53,166
My ex-husband.

1311
01:28:53,168 --> 01:28:55,404
And his
19-year-old girlfriend.

1312
01:28:58,639 --> 01:28:59,773
You wanna leave?

1313
01:28:59,775 --> 01:29:02,244
No, no. Deal's a deal.

1314
01:29:04,780 --> 01:29:06,078
It was fucking wild.

1315
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:08,348
I think I was certifiably
fucking insane

1316
01:29:08,350 --> 01:29:09,485
for a while back then.

1317
01:29:10,218 --> 01:29:11,818
When was this?

1318
01:29:11,820 --> 01:29:13,420
About nine,
ten months ago.

1319
01:29:13,422 --> 01:29:14,420
Were you on your own?

1320
01:29:14,422 --> 01:29:16,390
I had a couple
of buddies with me.

1321
01:29:16,392 --> 01:29:18,390
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1322
01:29:18,392 --> 01:29:20,560
They fuck her too?

1323
01:29:20,562 --> 01:29:23,697
I think they got their
kicks just watching, you know.

1324
01:29:23,699 --> 01:29:25,265
Oh, yeah?

1325
01:29:25,267 --> 01:29:26,466
Yeah.

1326
01:29:26,468 --> 01:29:27,734
Was she hot?

1327
01:29:27,736 --> 01:29:29,970
Once the gasoline
kicked in she was hot.

1328
01:29:31,139 --> 01:29:32,805
Swear, I wanted
to fuck her even more

1329
01:29:32,807 --> 01:29:34,342
right then and there.

1330
01:29:35,945 --> 01:29:38,511
I don't know if I could
get that out of my mind.

1331
01:30:19,722 --> 01:30:21,086
I ain't going down
for that shit,

1332
01:30:21,088 --> 01:30:23,057
last fucking day
down there.

1333
01:30:30,097 --> 01:30:32,165
He been there
the whole time?

1334
01:30:32,167 --> 01:30:33,300
Who?

1335
01:30:33,302 --> 01:30:36,403
Burnt face Jake. Keeps
fucking walking up and down.

1336
01:30:36,405 --> 01:30:38,340
I don't know.
I don't think so.

1337
01:30:46,647 --> 01:30:48,116
- Another round?
- Yeah.

1338
01:30:51,652 --> 01:30:52,987
Eight bucks.

1339
01:31:25,285 --> 01:31:26,387
Maestro.

1340
01:31:31,258 --> 01:31:32,926
Can I help you
with something?

1341
01:31:32,928 --> 01:31:34,460
Excuse me?

1342
01:31:34,462 --> 01:31:36,229
Looking over here
all fucking night.

1343
01:31:36,231 --> 01:31:38,198
Unless you've got
something to say,

1344
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:39,899
why don't you take
your burnt fucking face

1345
01:31:39,901 --> 01:31:41,236
and get the fuck
out of here?

1346
01:31:44,405 --> 01:31:45,738
What are you doing?

1347
01:31:45,740 --> 01:31:48,507
Wait, wait, wait...

1348
01:31:48,509 --> 01:31:52,146
Just trust me, okay?
Do you like magic?

1349
01:31:55,683 --> 01:31:56,815
Just trust me.

1350
01:31:56,817 --> 01:31:58,454
Just do the fucking
trick, man.

1351
01:32:00,254 --> 01:32:01,289
Okay.

1352
01:32:10,098 --> 01:32:11,299
What the fuck!

1353
01:32:14,203 --> 01:32:15,270
Hey.

1354
01:32:16,370 --> 01:32:17,502
Hey!

1355
01:32:17,504 --> 01:32:19,838
- That's enough!
- What's it to you, fucker?

1356
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:21,073
Guy is a cop, man.
He's a cop.

1357
01:32:21,075 --> 01:32:23,242
Oh, yeah?

1358
01:32:23,244 --> 01:32:24,713
He ain't wearing
no badge.

1359
01:32:25,446 --> 01:32:26,748
I lost my badge.

1360
01:32:28,348 --> 01:32:30,448
Can't remember
where I lost it.

1361
01:32:30,450 --> 01:32:33,254
You started this.
I didn't do shit to you!

1362
01:32:33,989 --> 01:32:35,521
I know I started it.

1363
01:32:35,523 --> 01:32:38,123
I scratched you up
like a bitch.

1364
01:32:38,125 --> 01:32:39,891
That's exactly
fucking right.

1365
01:32:56,645 --> 01:32:58,781
I'm gonna go use
the little boy's room.

1366
01:33:10,191 --> 01:33:11,491
You got something
to say to me?

1367
01:33:11,493 --> 01:33:13,426
If I'd known, we could
have double dated.

1368
01:33:13,428 --> 01:33:16,528
Doesn't shit girl
have a curfew weeknights?

1369
01:33:16,530 --> 01:33:17,697
No.

1370
01:33:17,699 --> 01:33:20,866
I was gonna take her
to the circus later,

1371
01:33:20,868 --> 01:33:22,068
but there's no need now.

1372
01:33:22,070 --> 01:33:23,470
Does he juggle?

1373
01:33:23,472 --> 01:33:27,006
I'm having dinner
because he did me a favor.

1374
01:33:27,008 --> 01:33:28,942
You don't
have to explain

1375
01:33:28,944 --> 01:33:30,510
why you're having dinner
with a midget.

1376
01:33:30,512 --> 01:33:32,479
I'm not explaining
myself to you.

1377
01:33:32,481 --> 01:33:33,749
You kind of are.

1378
01:33:38,687 --> 01:33:41,186
I didn't come here
to break your balls.

1379
01:33:41,188 --> 01:33:43,624
You can date as many
midgets as you want.

1380
01:33:45,293 --> 01:33:48,694
I came to say
I was sorry, actually.

1381
01:33:48,696 --> 01:33:50,329
Sorry for what?

1382
01:33:50,331 --> 01:33:52,465
Sorry about what happened
to your billboards and all.

1383
01:33:52,467 --> 01:33:55,667
It's all water under
the bridge, I guess.

1384
01:33:55,669 --> 01:33:57,036
Good.

1385
01:33:57,038 --> 01:33:58,537
I'm glad.
I was pretty drunk,

1386
01:33:58,539 --> 01:34:01,209
but it still
don't excuse it.

1387
01:34:02,945 --> 01:34:05,478
All this anger, man.

1388
01:34:05,480 --> 01:34:08,413
Penelope said to me
the other day...

1389
01:34:08,415 --> 01:34:11,486
"It just begets
greater anger."

1390
01:34:12,120 --> 01:34:14,690
You know? It's true.

1391
01:34:17,292 --> 01:34:19,194
Penelope
said "begets"?

1392
01:34:20,628 --> 01:34:21,697
Yeah.

1393
01:34:22,463 --> 01:34:25,199
"It begets
greater anger."

1394
01:34:28,002 --> 01:34:29,735
Well...

1395
01:34:29,737 --> 01:34:33,038
You take care of this
little lady, okay, sport?

1396
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:35,710
Big lady
compared to you, right?

1397
01:34:45,285 --> 01:34:48,186
- You all right?
- I think I wanna go home now.

1398
01:34:48,188 --> 01:34:49,387
Don't give me
any shit, James.

1399
01:34:49,389 --> 01:34:51,459
We'll do it another night,
all right?

1400
01:34:52,259 --> 01:34:54,126
Why would I want to?

1401
01:34:54,128 --> 01:34:57,630
You've been embarrassed
ever since we arrived.

1402
01:34:57,632 --> 01:35:00,131
For Christ sake.
I didn't force you

1403
01:35:00,133 --> 01:35:03,171
to come on this date.
You forced me.

1404
01:35:04,905 --> 01:35:06,307
Forced you?

1405
01:35:07,508 --> 01:35:09,641
I asked you on a date.

1406
01:35:09,643 --> 01:35:12,077
Wow. You know...

1407
01:35:12,079 --> 01:35:16,382
I know I'm
not that much of a catch.

1408
01:35:16,384 --> 01:35:18,818
I know I'm a dwarf
who sells used cars

1409
01:35:18,820 --> 01:35:20,952
and has a drinking problem.

1410
01:35:20,954 --> 01:35:22,555
But who the hell
are you, man?

1411
01:35:22,557 --> 01:35:24,791
You're that
billboard lady who

1412
01:35:24,793 --> 01:35:25,891
never smiles,

1413
01:35:25,893 --> 01:35:28,260
never has a good word
to say about anybody,

1414
01:35:28,262 --> 01:35:30,063
and who,
in the evening times,

1415
01:35:30,065 --> 01:35:31,866
sets fucking fire
to police stations!

1416
01:35:33,535 --> 01:35:36,738
And I'm the one
who's not a catch?

1417
01:35:38,705 --> 01:35:39,740
Hey!

1418
01:35:41,542 --> 01:35:45,213
You know, I didn't have to
come and hold your ladder.

1419
01:36:10,871 --> 01:36:12,540
Now, don't make a scene.

1420
01:36:15,043 --> 01:36:18,877
Did you really tell him
"Anger begets greater anger"?

1421
01:36:18,879 --> 01:36:20,747
Oh! Yes! I did.

1422
01:36:20,749 --> 01:36:22,348
I didn't make it up
myself though.

1423
01:36:22,350 --> 01:36:23,582
I can't claim that.

1424
01:36:23,584 --> 01:36:25,987
No, I read it
on a bookmark.

1425
01:36:27,588 --> 01:36:29,624
Which was in a book
I was reading.

1426
01:36:30,991 --> 01:36:32,460
About polio.

1427
01:36:33,594 --> 01:36:36,363
Polo. No. Which is the
one with the horses?

1428
01:36:36,365 --> 01:36:37,697
Polio or polo?

1429
01:36:37,699 --> 01:36:38,967
- Polo.
- Polo.

1430
01:36:50,011 --> 01:36:51,812
Be nice to her,
Charlie.

1431
01:36:53,748 --> 01:36:54,982
You got that?

1432
01:37:08,295 --> 01:37:10,395
Jason!

1433
01:37:10,397 --> 01:37:12,064
- Jason.
- Don't look at me.

1434
01:37:12,066 --> 01:37:13,198
What have they
done to you?

1435
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:14,402
Leave me, Momma.

1436
01:37:15,335 --> 01:37:17,002
No. No!

1437
01:37:20,173 --> 01:37:21,776
Open up this door!

1438
01:37:22,410 --> 01:37:24,045
Please, Jason.

1439
01:37:24,945 --> 01:37:27,581
I love you. Please.

1440
01:37:30,151 --> 01:37:33,955
You're my baby boy.
Open this door.

1441
01:37:34,789 --> 01:37:35,956
Please.

1442
01:37:38,026 --> 01:37:40,126
Jason, please.

1443
01:37:43,230 --> 01:37:44,566
Please.

1444
01:37:45,165 --> 01:37:47,768
Please open the door.

1445
01:37:55,910 --> 01:37:57,512
Open up!

1446
01:37:59,179 --> 01:38:01,747
Jason!

1447
01:38:01,749 --> 01:38:05,786
I'm all right, Momma.
It's all gonna be all right.

1448
01:38:29,744 --> 01:38:31,411
I don't wanna get your
hopes up, all right,

1449
01:38:31,413 --> 01:38:33,179
but there is a guy,
and I think

1450
01:38:33,181 --> 01:38:36,681
he might be the guy.
I got his DNA.

1451
01:38:36,683 --> 01:38:38,751
Got a lot of it,
actually.

1452
01:38:38,753 --> 01:38:41,121
They're making the checks
as we speak.

1453
01:38:41,123 --> 01:38:42,854
He's in jail?

1454
01:38:42,856 --> 01:38:46,559
No, but he ain't
gonna be hard to find.

1455
01:38:46,561 --> 01:38:48,159
Why do you think
he's the guy?

1456
01:38:48,161 --> 01:38:49,360
I heard him
talking about

1457
01:38:49,362 --> 01:38:52,264
something he did
to a girl last year.

1458
01:38:52,266 --> 01:38:54,102
I couldn't hear
all of it, but...

1459
01:38:55,436 --> 01:38:58,807
It sounded a lot like
what happened to Angela.

1460
01:38:59,906 --> 01:39:02,041
And then he beat
the crap out of me.

1461
01:39:02,043 --> 01:39:03,609
But because of that,

1462
01:39:03,611 --> 01:39:05,614
I got a bunch of his DNA.

1463
01:39:06,347 --> 01:39:07,916
So, I wanted to

1464
01:39:08,782 --> 01:39:11,350
let you know sooner
rather than later.

1465
01:39:11,352 --> 01:39:13,155
I didn't want you
to give up hope.

1466
01:39:14,588 --> 01:39:16,555
I've been trying
not to.

1467
01:39:16,557 --> 01:39:20,359
Well...
All you can do is try.

1468
01:39:20,361 --> 01:39:22,494
As my momma says,

1469
01:39:22,496 --> 01:39:24,633
it's not so much
about hope as about...

1470
01:39:26,468 --> 01:39:27,867
Well, I didn't used to be

1471
01:39:27,869 --> 01:39:29,868
very good at English
at school.

1472
01:39:29,870 --> 01:39:31,537
So it was more
"All you can do is try

1473
01:39:31,539 --> 01:39:34,176
"to not be so crap
at English."

1474
01:39:36,878 --> 01:39:40,512
Because you need English,
really, if you wanna be a cop.

1475
01:39:40,514 --> 01:39:43,185
If you wanna be
anything, really.

1476
01:39:49,423 --> 01:39:51,892
Unless you live in Mexico
or something.

1477
01:39:52,893 --> 01:39:54,562
Who wants that?

1478
01:40:15,583 --> 01:40:16,785
Hey, Dixon?

1479
01:40:22,190 --> 01:40:23,225
Thank you.

1480
01:40:57,258 --> 01:40:58,960
You did good, Jason.

1481
01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:01,161
You did real good.

1482
01:41:10,070 --> 01:41:11,739
But he wasn't the guy.

1483
01:41:19,213 --> 01:41:20,445
What?

1484
01:41:20,447 --> 01:41:22,582
There was no match
to the DNA.

1485
01:41:22,584 --> 01:41:25,417
No matches to any other
crimes of this nature.

1486
01:41:25,419 --> 01:41:28,153
To any crimes at all,
in fact.

1487
01:41:28,155 --> 01:41:29,858
And his record is clean.

1488
01:41:30,790 --> 01:41:32,561
Maybe he was
just bragging.

1489
01:41:33,393 --> 01:41:34,626
He wasn't just bragging.

1490
01:41:34,628 --> 01:41:36,362
Well, that's as may be.

1491
01:41:36,364 --> 01:41:38,663
But at the time
of Angela's death,

1492
01:41:38,665 --> 01:41:40,934
he wasn't even
in the country.

1493
01:41:40,936 --> 01:41:42,333
Where was he?

1494
01:41:42,335 --> 01:41:45,403
I've seen his records of entry
and exit to the States,

1495
01:41:45,405 --> 01:41:48,341
and spoken to his CO.

1496
01:41:48,343 --> 01:41:51,813
He wasn't in the country,
Dixon. He ain't our guy.

1497
01:41:53,013 --> 01:41:54,281
No, he

1498
01:41:56,551 --> 01:41:57,916
might not be our guy,

1499
01:41:57,918 --> 01:41:59,685
but he still done
something shitty.

1500
01:41:59,687 --> 01:42:00,886
I know he did.

1501
01:42:00,888 --> 01:42:02,757
Not in Missouri
he didn't.

1502
01:42:03,391 --> 01:42:04,590
Where was he?

1503
01:42:04,592 --> 01:42:07,193
That's
classified information.

1504
01:42:07,195 --> 01:42:09,060
Oh, come on, man.

1505
01:42:09,062 --> 01:42:11,730
If the guy
has a commanding officer,

1506
01:42:11,732 --> 01:42:13,466
and if the guy
got back to the country

1507
01:42:13,468 --> 01:42:14,667
nine months ago,

1508
01:42:14,669 --> 01:42:17,769
and if the country
where he was is classified,

1509
01:42:17,771 --> 01:42:20,140
which country
do you think he was in?

1510
01:42:21,476 --> 01:42:23,178
Hey, you know...

1511
01:42:25,346 --> 01:42:26,781
I'll give you a clue.

1512
01:42:28,516 --> 01:42:30,118
It was sandy.

1513
01:42:34,054 --> 01:42:36,324
That doesn't really
narrow it down.

1514
01:42:38,593 --> 01:42:40,591
All you need
to know is that

1515
01:42:40,593 --> 01:42:42,661
he didn't do nothing
to Angela Hayes.

1516
01:42:42,663 --> 01:42:45,200
So, we're gonna
keep looking.

1517
01:42:51,239 --> 01:42:52,307
All right?

1518
01:43:03,383 --> 01:43:05,319
I found my badge
after all.

1519
01:44:13,087 --> 01:44:14,155
Hello?

1520
01:44:14,755 --> 01:44:16,057
<i>It's Dixon.</i>

1521
01:44:21,294 --> 01:44:22,730
Tell me.

1522
01:44:25,432 --> 01:44:27,198
He weren't the guy.

1523
01:44:43,017 --> 01:44:44,285
Mildred?

1524
01:44:54,562 --> 01:44:56,030
Are you sure?

1525
01:44:57,632 --> 01:45:01,469
He... He weren't even in
the country when it happened.

1526
01:45:03,070 --> 01:45:08,142
So, whatever he did,
he didn't do it round here.

1527
01:45:09,610 --> 01:45:12,176
<i>I'm sorry I got
your hopes up.</i>

1528
01:45:12,178 --> 01:45:14,248
That's all right.
That's all right.

1529
01:45:17,017 --> 01:45:18,283
At least I had
a day of hoping,

1530
01:45:18,285 --> 01:45:20,822
and that's more
than I've had for a while.

1531
01:45:27,495 --> 01:45:28,797
I gotta go.

1532
01:45:32,566 --> 01:45:34,002
There was, uh...

1533
01:45:35,536 --> 01:45:37,806
There was one thing
I was thinking.

1534
01:45:40,441 --> 01:45:41,810
<i>What's that?</i>

1535
01:45:42,576 --> 01:45:44,445
I know he ain't
your rapist.

1536
01:45:45,780 --> 01:45:49,884
He is a rapist, though.
I'm sure of that.

1537
01:45:58,090 --> 01:45:59,828
What are you
saying to me?

1538
01:46:01,962 --> 01:46:03,598
Got his license plate.

1539
01:46:06,734 --> 01:46:08,468
I know where he lives.

1540
01:46:11,472 --> 01:46:12,907
Where's he live?

1541
01:46:14,807 --> 01:46:16,310
He lives in Idaho.

1542
01:46:22,616 --> 01:46:23,951
That's funny.

1543
01:46:27,087 --> 01:46:29,357
I'm driving to Idaho
in the morning.

1544
01:46:34,928 --> 01:46:36,431
Want some company?

1545
01:46:42,169 --> 01:46:43,237
Sure.

1546
01:49:25,266 --> 01:49:27,502
- Hey, Dixon?
- Yeah?

1547
01:49:28,835 --> 01:49:30,237
I need to tell you
something.

1548
01:49:32,539 --> 01:49:35,343
It was me that burned down
the police station.

1549
01:49:37,611 --> 01:49:40,281
Why, who the hell else
would it have been?

1550
01:49:52,359 --> 01:49:53,628
Dixon?

1551
01:49:54,328 --> 01:49:55,827
Yeah?

1552
01:49:55,829 --> 01:49:57,729
Are you sure
about this?

1553
01:49:57,731 --> 01:49:59,534
About killing this guy?

1554
01:50:02,002 --> 01:50:04,237
Not really. You?

1555
01:50:07,607 --> 01:50:09,209
Not really.

1556
01:50:11,511 --> 01:50:13,781
I guess we can decide
along the way.
