1
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:50,773
So beautiful.

2
00:03:57,363 --> 00:03:59,240
We're the same temperature now.

3
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:20,970
Hey, Bella,

4
00:04:24,057 --> 00:04:26,392
you're a lot stronger than I am right now.

5
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,443
It's your turn not to break me.

6
00:04:38,071 --> 00:04:39,322
I love you.

7
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:41,783
I love you.

8
00:04:52,961 --> 00:04:54,087
Renesmee.

9
00:04:56,255 --> 00:04:57,590
She's incredible.

10
00:04:57,674 --> 00:04:59,092
Where is she? I have to see her.

11
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:00,510
Wait. Wait.

12
00:05:01,761 --> 00:05:03,846
You need to get your thirst under control.

13
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,851
Yeah, you'll need to hunt.

14
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:55,732
Close your eyes.

15
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:01,654
What do you hear?

16
00:06:55,792 --> 00:06:57,251
Bella, don't!

17
00:07:15,603 --> 00:07:16,687
Bella, stop!

18
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:21,489
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
there'd be people this far from the trails.

19
00:07:27,115 --> 00:07:28,449
I have to get outta here.

20
00:07:28,783 --> 00:07:30,451
Okay, I can help you.

21
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,459
Or not.

22
00:08:04,986 --> 00:08:06,445
Well, I'm amazed.

23
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:09,323
You ran away from human blood mid-hunt.

24
00:08:09,532 --> 00:08:11,784
Even mature vampires
have problems with that.

25
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,168
You're still here.

26
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:21,586
So are you.

27
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,922
I didn't expect you to seem so

28
00:08:26,549 --> 00:08:27,592
you.

29
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:30,720
Except for the creepy eyes.

30
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:34,140
I would keep my distance for now.

31
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:37,560
It's safer for the baby
to see how you do with me first.

32
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:39,854
Since when do you care about Renesmee?

33
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:45,985
All right.

34
00:08:48,112 --> 00:08:49,405
Take a whiff.

35
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:04,128
Well, I can see
what everyone's been talking about.

36
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:07,048
Jake, you really do stink.

37
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:12,970
You GUYS

38
00:09:15,473 --> 00:09:16,933
really look great together.

39
00:09:21,145 --> 00:09:22,688
Want to come meet our daughter?

40
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:38,079
Welcome to the family.

41
00:09:40,498 --> 00:09:42,166
You look amazing, Bella.

42
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,543
Someone's been waiting to meet you.

43
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:47,797
Rose.

44
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:23,499
Beautiful.

45
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:29,922
What was that?

46
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:32,842
She showed you
the first memory she has of you.

47
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,178
Showed me? How?

48
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,266
How do I hear thoughts?

49
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:42,393
How does Alice see the future?

50
00:10:45,396 --> 00:10:46,814
She's gifted.

51
00:10:49,984 --> 00:10:51,819
I've only been out for two days?

52
00:10:52,111 --> 00:10:53,988
Her growth rate is unprecedented.

53
00:10:55,323 --> 00:10:58,034
All right. That's enough
experimenting for one day.

54
00:10:58,117 --> 00:10:59,118
Jacob.

55
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,037
She's doing great.

56
00:11:01,287 --> 00:11:03,247
Yeah. Let's not push it though.

57
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:06,584
What's your problem?

58
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:10,296
Do tell her, Jacob.

59
00:11:10,421 --> 00:11:11,756
This should be good.

60
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:13,424
Hold on a second.

61
00:11:14,425 --> 00:11:15,426
Bella.

62
00:11:18,346 --> 00:11:19,388
Look,

63
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:22,433
it's a wolf thing.

64
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:23,851
What's a wolf thing?

65
00:11:28,898 --> 00:11:30,983
You know we have no control over it.

66
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,277
We can't choose who it happens with.

67
00:11:33,486 --> 00:11:36,572
And it doesn't mean
what you think, Bella. I promise.

68
00:11:36,906 --> 00:11:38,491
Take Renesmee out of the room.

69
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:40,826
Edward, don't touch me right now.

70
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,286
I don't want to hurt you.

71
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,462
You imprinted on my daughter?

72
00:11:51,587 --> 00:11:53,005
It wasn't my choice!

73
00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:54,131
She's a baby!

74
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:55,341
It's not like that.

75
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:57,225
You think Edward would
let me live if it was?

76
00:11:57,426 --> 00:11:58,427
I'm still debating it.

77
00:11:58,511 --> 00:12:00,346
I've held her once!

78
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:02,181
One time, Jacob!

79
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:04,350
And already you think that
you have some moronic

80
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:06,102
wolfy claim on her?

81
00:12:06,936 --> 00:12:08,187
She's mine!

82
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:16,612
It's fine, Leah.

83
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:19,281
You're gonna stay away from her.

84
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:20,699
You know I can't do that.

85
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,121
Stop her, Edward.

86
00:12:25,204 --> 00:12:26,956
He said it's fine.

87
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:28,207
She's amazing, right?

88
00:12:31,961 --> 00:12:34,880
Do you remember how much
you wanted to be around me 3 days ago?

89
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:36,006
That's gone now, right?

90
00:12:36,132 --> 00:12:37,091
Long gone.

91
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:38,342
Because it was her.

92
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:42,138
From the beginning it was
Nessie who wanted me there.

93
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:43,305
Nessie?

94
00:12:44,056 --> 00:12:47,143
You nicknamed my daughter
after the Loch Ness monster?

95
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:55,734
Seth, are you okay?

96
00:12:58,863 --> 00:13:00,739
Seth, I'm sorry.

97
00:13:01,991 --> 00:13:03,159
He'll be all right.

98
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:08,664
Bella,

99
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:13,335
you know me better than anyone.

100
00:13:13,711 --> 00:13:15,337
All I want is for Ness...

101
00:13:17,006 --> 00:13:20,009
Renesmee to be safe. Happy.

102
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,011
Look,

103
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:24,221
nothing ever made sense before.

104
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:27,016
You. Me. Any of it.

105
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,393
And now I understand why.

106
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:31,270
This was the reason.

107
00:13:56,712 --> 00:13:58,047
Finally.

108
00:14:05,304 --> 00:14:06,555
My turn.

109
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:15,648
Where does she sleep?

110
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:19,068
In my arms. Or Edward's or Esme's.

111
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:27,826
Happy birthday.

112
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,246
I stopped aging three days ago.

113
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:32,748
Well, we're celebrating anyway.
So suck it up.

114
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:42,174
I still hate surprises.
That hasn't changed.

115
00:14:42,675 --> 00:14:44,093
You'll love this one.

116
00:14:48,806 --> 00:14:50,266
Welcome home!

117
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,436
We thought you guys
might like a place of your own.

118
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:57,106
What do you think?

119
00:14:57,273 --> 00:14:58,941
I think it's perfect.

120
00:15:01,277 --> 00:15:02,278
Go inside.

121
00:15:12,204 --> 00:15:13,455
Have fun.

122
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:42,318
This will be Renesmee's room.

123
00:15:53,329 --> 00:15:54,330
Closet.

124
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,335
Alice stocked it for you.

125
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,921
Clearly.

126
00:16:16,435 --> 00:16:17,561
This is our room.

127
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:26,779
Vampires don't sleep.

128
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:30,240
It's not intended for sleep.

129
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:55,159
You really were holding back before.

130
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:00,956
I'm never gonna get enough of this.

131
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,708
We don't get tired.

132
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:06,795
We don't have to rest
or catch our breath or eat.

133
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:07,880
I mean,

134
00:18:07,881 --> 00:18:08,797
I mean,

135
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:11,258
how are we gonna stop?

136
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:17,973
Rosalie and Emmett were so bad,
it took a solid decade

137
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:21,351
before we could stand to be
within five miles of them.

138
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,190
I think we might be worse.

139
00:18:27,483 --> 00:18:28,817
Definitely worse.

140
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:48,337
Done already?

141
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:50,672
Where's Renesmee?

142
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:52,341
Blondie stole her.

143
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:56,470
Break a lot of stuff?

144
00:18:56,887 --> 00:18:58,180
Emmett.

145
00:18:58,514 --> 00:18:59,515
No.

146
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:14,363
Is that Charlie?

147
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:17,199
He's been calling twice a day.

148
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:20,661
He's in pretty rough shape.

149
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:25,457
Eventually, we'll have to tell him
you didn't make it.

150
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,627
He needs to mourn, Bella.

151
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,716
Okay. We'll do it tomorrow.

152
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:39,972
I'm gonna miss this place.

153
00:19:40,389 --> 00:19:42,599
We'll come back. We always do.

154
00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:45,644
Wait.

155
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:48,981
Nobody said anything about leaving.

156
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:52,776
Once people believe Bella's dead,
we can't risk anyone seeing her.

157
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:56,530
So you just disappear?

158
00:19:56,655 --> 00:19:58,282
Jacob, we don't have another choice.

159
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:38,614
Hey.

160
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:40,449
You heard anything?

161
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:44,620
Charlie,

162
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:49,207
Bella is...

163
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:54,588
No, she's not.

164
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:56,256
No, no, no, I mean, she's fine.

165
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,633
She's back home and

166
00:20:58,508 --> 00:21:00,344
she's feeling better.

167
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:05,140
Why didn't you say so? That's great.

168
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:08,101
Wait.

169
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:10,354
There's something you need to see first.

170
00:21:10,854 --> 00:21:12,064
I need to see Bella.

171
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:13,649
Look,

172
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:17,736
in order for Bella to
get better, she had to

173
00:21:20,739 --> 00:21:22,157
change.

174
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:24,993
What do you mean, "change"?

175
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,876
Here goes nothing.

176
00:21:33,502 --> 00:21:35,337
What the hell are you doing?

177
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:37,714
You don't live in the
world you think you do.

178
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:42,260
Jacob, put your clothes on.

179
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:46,181
Now, this may seem strange.

180
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:49,184
Really strange. But

181
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:52,729
stranger things happen every day.

182
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:54,564
Trust me.

183
00:22:00,988 --> 00:22:02,823
Holy shit!

184
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:11,039
<i>Look, I solved</i> a <i>problem.</i>

185
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:12,708
You were leaving.

186
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:14,334
What did you expect me to do?

187
00:22:14,418 --> 00:22:16,378
You don't realize
the danger you've put him in.

188
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:18,839
The Volturi will kill anyone
who knows about us.

189
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:21,008
No, I didn't tell him about you. Just me.

190
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:22,843
I only said you were different.

191
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:25,095
And that we have a niece who we adopted.

192
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,639
I mean, seriously, Jake,
he's not just gonna let that go.

193
00:22:27,723 --> 00:22:30,225
Did you consider
the physical pain he'll put Bella through?

194
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:33,437
It'll be like sticking
a white hot branding iron down her throat.

195
00:22:33,562 --> 00:22:35,564
And that's assuming
she can control her thirst.

196
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:37,274
Look, Charlie's been in hell.

197
00:22:37,566 --> 00:22:39,901
And I know you'll be
much happier with him in your life.

198
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:42,868
Jacob, don't try and pretend you're
doing this for anyone but yourself.

199
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:45,907
Sorry you feel that way

200
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:48,410
because he'll be here in 10 minutes.

201
00:22:48,577 --> 00:22:49,578
What?

202
00:22:49,745 --> 00:22:51,580
These will irritate your eyes at first.

203
00:22:53,874 --> 00:22:55,709
The main thing is not to move too fast.

204
00:22:56,043 --> 00:22:58,795
Try taking a seat. Crossing your legs.

205
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:10,015
Maybe a tad slower.

206
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:11,699
And blink at least three times a minute.

207
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,271
Good.

208
00:23:17,522 --> 00:23:19,399
For a cartoon character.

209
00:23:19,608 --> 00:23:21,693
Hold your breath. It will
help with the thirst.

210
00:23:22,903 --> 00:23:25,906
Just don't forget to move your shoulders
so it looks like you're breathing.

211
00:23:29,201 --> 00:23:30,702
And don't sit so straight.

212
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,205
Humans don't do that.

213
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:38,210
Okay. I got it.

214
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:40,295
Move around, blink, slouch.

215
00:23:56,061 --> 00:23:57,270
Good luck.

216
00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:11,993
Hello, Charlie.

217
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:16,957
Where's Bella?

218
00:24:46,194 --> 00:24:47,195
Bella.

219
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:48,613
Hi, Dad.

220
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,369
Are you okay?

221
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:57,205
Never better.

222
00:24:58,707 --> 00:24:59,833
Healthy as a horse.

223
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,550
You don't turn into an animal, too, do you?

224
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:13,555
She wishes she was that awesome.

225
00:25:17,392 --> 00:25:19,227
Let's give them some privacy.

226
00:25:33,742 --> 00:25:36,244
Jake said that this...

227
00:25:38,246 --> 00:25:40,081
This was necessary.

228
00:25:40,207 --> 00:25:41,416
What does that mean?

229
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:44,650
I really think it would be better...

230
00:25:44,753 --> 00:25:46,421
I wanna know what happened to you.

231
00:25:46,588 --> 00:25:47,756
I can't tell you.

232
00:25:49,216 --> 00:25:50,717
I think I deserve an explanation.

233
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,801
You do.

234
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,972
But if you really need
one, I can't stay here.

235
00:25:56,223 --> 00:25:57,557
Oh, come on! No!

236
00:25:57,641 --> 00:25:59,100
No more going away!

237
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:02,229
Dad, you're just gonna have to trust
that for whatever reason,

238
00:26:03,104 --> 00:26:04,105
I'm all right.

239
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:05,774
I'm more than all right.

240
00:26:06,441 --> 00:26:07,734
Can you live with that?

241
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:10,737
Can I live With that?

242
00:26:12,572 --> 00:26:13,949
Well, I don't know, Bella.

243
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:17,160
I mean, I just watched a kid
I've known his entire life

244
00:26:17,285 --> 00:26:19,287
turn into a very large dog.

245
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,123
My daughter looks like my daughter.

246
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:24,459
But doesn't.

247
00:26:27,462 --> 00:26:30,924
Can you please just believe that I'll
tell you anything that you need to know?

248
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:35,470
And I don't need to know this?

249
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:37,472
No.

250
00:26:37,973 --> 00:26:39,307
Really, you don't.

251
00:26:44,938 --> 00:26:46,147
Well...

252
00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:49,651
Not gonna lose you again.

253
00:26:51,152 --> 00:26:52,487
I can't.

254
00:26:54,531 --> 00:26:55,824
Then you won't.

255
00:26:58,493 --> 00:26:59,661
I promise.

256
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:17,846
I missed you, Bells.

257
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:20,682
So much.

258
00:27:23,143 --> 00:27:24,811
I missed you, Dad.

259
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:30,692
Charlie.

260
00:27:33,903 --> 00:27:35,238
This is Renesmee.

261
00:27:40,702 --> 00:27:41,786
Your niece?

262
00:27:43,872 --> 00:27:45,040
Our daughter.

263
00:27:49,377 --> 00:27:50,378
Right.

264
00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:52,047
The adoption.

265
00:27:58,219 --> 00:27:59,554
Renee-semee?

266
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:05,143
She's got your eyes, Bella.

267
00:28:13,443 --> 00:28:15,320
Need to know, I guess.

268
00:28:30,835 --> 00:28:32,003
Well clone, Bella.

269
00:28:32,337 --> 00:28:34,589
Never seen a newborn
show that kind of restraint.

270
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:37,425
I'm not sure she is a newborn.

271
00:28:37,842 --> 00:28:39,677
She's so tame.

272
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:42,680
Emmett, don't antagonize her.

273
00:28:42,764 --> 00:28:44,244
She's the strongest one in the house.

274
00:28:44,516 --> 00:28:46,893
Please.

275
00:28:52,941 --> 00:28:54,609
Don't hurt yourself, Emmett.

276
00:28:57,779 --> 00:28:58,947
All right. On 3.

277
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,657
1,

278
00:29:01,533 --> 00:29:02,951
<i>Z,</i>

279
00:29:04,327 --> 00:29:06,121
Three!

280
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:22,637
Did you see that?

281
00:29:28,977 --> 00:29:30,311
Thank you.

282
00:29:53,168 --> 00:29:55,170
<i>My time as a human was over.</i>

283
00:29:56,838 --> 00:29:58,840
<i>But I never felt more alive.</i>

284
00:30:00,925 --> 00:30:01,800
<i>I was born to be a vampire.</i>

285
00:30:01,801 --> 00:30:02,882
<i>I was born to be a vampire.</i>

286
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:19,861
<i>Everything was falling into place.</i>

287
00:30:23,698 --> 00:30:26,117
<i>Even the Volturi
seemed to accept my new status.</i>

288
00:30:26,743 --> 00:30:28,244
<i>Though they'd want proof eventually.</i>

289
00:30:32,582 --> 00:30:34,062
<i>It seemed we had only one enemy left.</i>

290
00:30:35,543 --> 00:30:36,544
<i>Time.</i>

291
00:30:38,129 --> 00:30:39,881
<i>Renesmee was growing too fast.</i>

292
00:30:44,594 --> 00:30:47,055
<i>We all worried about
how long we would have with her.</i>

293
00:30:48,848 --> 00:30:50,725
<i>It just made every moment more precious.</i>

294
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,894
Look, a snowflake.

295
00:30:53,728 --> 00:30:54,771
It's beautiful.

296
00:30:55,563 --> 00:30:56,884
Why don't you go get another one?

297
00:31:01,945 --> 00:31:04,113
Edward thinks that
we'll find answers in Brazil.

298
00:31:05,865 --> 00:31:07,785
There are tribes there
that might know something.

299
00:31:24,634 --> 00:31:25,718
RENESMEEI Who was that?

300
00:31:26,803 --> 00:31:29,264
I think that's our cousin from Denali.

301
00:31:33,601 --> 00:31:34,727
Irina!

302
00:31:57,875 --> 00:32:00,295
Tanya convinced Irina
to come reconcile with us.

303
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,088
It looks like she changed her mind.

304
00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:04,549
Seeing Jacob
must have been too much for her.

305
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:06,593
Wish I could have just spoken to her.

306
00:32:06,718 --> 00:32:09,053
She's family. She'll come around.

307
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:21,542
What a pleasant surprise.

308
00:33:24,212 --> 00:33:25,505
What do you want?

309
00:33:31,886 --> 00:33:35,098
I have to report a crime.

310
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:38,935
The Cullens...

311
00:33:39,936 --> 00:33:42,939
They've done something terrible.

312
00:33:45,233 --> 00:33:47,527
Allow me, my dear.

313
00:34:06,337 --> 00:34:07,588
Oh, my-

314
00:34:40,872 --> 00:34:42,039
What is it, Alice?

315
00:34:43,124 --> 00:34:44,208
The Volturi.

316
00:34:45,793 --> 00:34:46,961
They're coming for us.

317
00:34:47,295 --> 00:34:51,966
Aro, Caius, Marcus, the Guard.

318
00:34:52,175 --> 00:34:53,176
And Irina.

319
00:34:53,384 --> 00:34:54,385
Honey, come here.

320
00:34:56,721 --> 00:34:58,055
Why?

321
00:34:58,139 --> 00:34:59,265
What did Irina see in the woods?

322
00:34:59,348 --> 00:35:00,683
We were just walking.

323
00:35:01,309 --> 00:35:02,935
Ness was catching snowflakes.

324
00:35:06,647 --> 00:35:07,940
Of course.

325
00:35:11,652 --> 00:35:13,946
Irina thinks Renesmee's an Immortal Child.

326
00:35:17,158 --> 00:35:19,327
The Immortal Children
were very beautiful.

327
00:35:19,702 --> 00:35:20,828
So enchanting.

328
00:35:20,953 --> 00:35:22,914
To be near them was to love them.

329
00:35:22,997 --> 00:35:25,708
But their development was frozen
at the age they were turned.

330
00:35:26,501 --> 00:35:28,669
They couldn't be taught or restrained.

331
00:35:30,046 --> 00:35:32,799
A single tantrum
could destroy an entire village.

332
00:35:39,806 --> 00:35:41,474
<i>Humans heard about the devastation.</i>

333
00:35:42,725 --> 00:35:43,851
<i>Stories spread.</i>

334
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:46,354
<i>The Volturi were forced to intervene.</i>

335
00:35:51,692 --> 00:35:54,028
Since the Children
couldn't protect our secret,

336
00:35:54,153 --> 00:35:55,404
they had to be destroyed.

337
00:36:03,412 --> 00:36:04,413
WOMAN; No!

338
00:36:05,748 --> 00:36:06,874
No!

339
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:08,626
No!

340
00:36:10,711 --> 00:36:13,548
<i>Their creators grew very attached
and fought to protect them.</i>

341
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,262
Long-established covens were torn apart.

342
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:21,848
Countless humans slaughtered.

343
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,185
<i>Traditions, friends,</i>

344
00:36:26,435 --> 00:36:28,396
<i>even families. Lost.</i>

345
00:36:28,563 --> 00:36:30,273
No, no!

346
00:36:30,398 --> 00:36:31,482
- Mother!
- No!

347
00:36:31,566 --> 00:36:33,025
Mother!

348
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:40,616
So the Denalis' mother
made an Immortal Child?

349
00:36:40,908 --> 00:36:41,909
Yes.

350
00:36:42,785 --> 00:36:44,245
And she paid the price.

351
00:37:07,435 --> 00:37:09,896
Well, Renesmee's nothing
like those children.

352
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:13,482
She was born, not bitten.
She grows every single day.

353
00:37:13,608 --> 00:37:15,610
So can't you just explain
that to the Volturi?

354
00:37:15,776 --> 00:37:17,987
Aro has enough proof in lrina's thoughts.

355
00:37:23,075 --> 00:37:24,160
So we fight.

356
00:37:24,285 --> 00:37:26,454
Their offensive
weapons are too powerful.

357
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:28,623
No one can stand against Jane.

358
00:37:28,956 --> 00:37:30,791
Alec's even worse.

359
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,627
Well, then we convince them.

360
00:37:32,835 --> 00:37:35,129
They're coming to kill us, not to talk.

361
00:37:35,463 --> 00:37:36,964
No, you're right.

362
00:37:37,465 --> 00:37:38,633
They won't listen to us.

363
00:37:40,426 --> 00:37:41,826
But maybe others can convince them.

364
00:37:41,844 --> 00:37:43,804
Carlisle, you have friends
all around the world.

365
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:45,264
I won't ask them to fight.

366
00:37:45,348 --> 00:37:46,766
Not fight. Witness.

367
00:37:47,308 --> 00:37:49,268
If enough people knew the truth,

368
00:37:49,352 --> 00:37:51,479
maybe we could convince
the Volturi to listen.

369
00:37:52,146 --> 00:37:53,856
We can ask this of our friends.

370
00:38:07,828 --> 00:38:09,079
At least we get to go to London again.

371
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:09,872
At least we get to go to London again.

372
00:38:09,956 --> 00:38:12,083
We haven't been there in a long time.

373
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:16,212
All right. Let's get this show on the road.

374
00:38:20,216 --> 00:38:21,634
<i>Alice asked me to give you that.</i>

375
00:38:22,343 --> 00:38:25,012
She and Jasper
crossed our lands to the ocean last night.

376
00:38:27,014 --> 00:38:28,057
Carlisle?

377
00:38:29,642 --> 00:38:30,851
They've left us.

378
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:32,520
Why?

379
00:38:34,063 --> 00:38:35,231
She didn't say.

380
00:38:37,483 --> 00:38:38,526
Can I see that?

381
00:38:45,866 --> 00:38:49,203
<i>Gather as many witnesses as you can
before the snow sticks to the ground.</i>

382
00:38:49,704 --> 00:38:51,038
<i>That's when they'll come.</i>

383
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,211
<i>Alice's instructions were clear,
but the question remained.</i>

384
00:38:58,379 --> 00:39:01,340
<i>Why would she and Jasper leave
at the moment we needed them most?</i>

385
00:39:02,049 --> 00:39:03,050
<i>What did they know?</i>

386
00:39:05,845 --> 00:39:09,557
<i>Our search for witnesses began
with a trip north to our closest relatives.</i>

387
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,052
Edward, is everything all right?

388
00:39:47,428 --> 00:39:49,096
Why didn't you tell us you were coming?

389
00:39:50,806 --> 00:39:51,891
Is it Irina?

390
00:39:52,433 --> 00:39:53,434
Have you heard from her?

391
00:39:53,601 --> 00:39:54,769
Not directly.

392
00:39:55,269 --> 00:39:57,104
Why is your bride waiting in the car?

393
00:39:57,396 --> 00:39:58,814
And why have you brought
a wolf with you?

394
00:39:58,898 --> 00:40:00,066
I can smell him from here.

395
00:40:00,566 --> 00:40:02,443
My family is in danger. I need your help.

396
00:40:02,568 --> 00:40:03,652
What's happened?

397
00:40:04,945 --> 00:40:05,905
It's hard to explain

398
00:40:05,988 --> 00:40:07,948
but I need you to be open-minded.
Can you do that?

399
00:40:08,115 --> 00:40:09,450
Of course.

400
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:15,915
Okay.

401
00:40:16,582 --> 00:40:18,000
Time to meet some new people.

402
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:19,418
What if they don't like me?

403
00:40:19,752 --> 00:40:22,129
- They'll love you.
- They will.

404
00:40:22,213 --> 00:40:23,464
Once they understand you.

405
00:40:23,589 --> 00:40:25,758
They just haven't met
anyone like you before.

406
00:40:30,429 --> 00:40:31,472
Okay.

407
00:40:41,732 --> 00:40:43,317
The Volturi will come for all of us.

408
00:40:43,734 --> 00:40:45,152
You get that thing out of here.

409
00:40:45,236 --> 00:40:46,436
She's not what she looks like.

410
00:40:46,445 --> 00:40:47,738
This is a crime!

411
00:40:58,791 --> 00:41:00,167
Stay back!

412
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:02,211
She has blood in her veins.

413
00:41:02,753 --> 00:41:04,088
You can feel her warmth.

414
00:41:04,463 --> 00:41:05,589
I can feel it.

415
00:41:05,673 --> 00:41:07,258
I'm her biological father.

416
00:41:07,883 --> 00:41:09,844
- Bella is her mother.
- Impossible.

417
00:41:09,927 --> 00:41:12,555
It's true. She was born
while I was still human.

418
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,140
I've never heard of such a thing.

419
00:41:14,265 --> 00:41:15,599
She can show you, if you let her.

420
00:41:20,187 --> 00:41:22,189
Tanya, you owe us this much.

421
00:41:22,982 --> 00:41:25,985
We're all under a death sentence
because your sister didn't let us explain.

422
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:35,327
Don't be afraid.

423
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:38,789
This is how she communicates.

424
00:41:53,387 --> 00:41:54,471
It's true.

425
00:41:57,016 --> 00:41:58,559
She's not immortal.

426
00:42:02,563 --> 00:42:05,357
<i>I knew the rest of our family
would face this fear as well.</i>

427
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:08,944
<i>Fear of the unknown.</i>

428
00:42:11,155 --> 00:42:12,364
<i>Fear of the Volturi.</i>

429
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,332
Amun, please!

430
00:42:23,042 --> 00:42:24,168
I cannot help you, Carlisle.

431
00:42:24,293 --> 00:42:25,733
I wouldn't ask if it weren't urgent.

432
00:42:25,878 --> 00:42:27,046
You must go.

433
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,976
I'd like to hear about it.

434
00:42:42,686 --> 00:42:44,855
I never get to meet any of Amun's friends.

435
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:46,482
He likes to keep me hidden.

436
00:42:46,607 --> 00:42:48,025
I can't imagine why.

437
00:43:02,873 --> 00:43:05,125
- Carlisle.
- Benjamin.

438
00:43:30,818 --> 00:43:32,569
Benjamin can
influence the elements.

439
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,572
And here I get super self-control.

440
00:44:00,889 --> 00:44:01,932
Who are they?

441
00:44:02,933 --> 00:44:04,351
Senna and Zafrina.

442
00:44:04,893 --> 00:44:06,186
From the Amazon.

443
00:44:16,196 --> 00:44:18,782
<i>The arrival of Senna and Zafrina
meant that our plea was being heard</i>

444
00:44:18,866 --> 00:44:21,035
<i>in even the most remote
corners of the world</i>

445
00:44:21,452 --> 00:44:23,495
<i>while others searched for
witnesses closer to home.</i>

446
00:44:29,043 --> 00:44:31,962
<i>A patriot Carlisle first met</i>
<i>on the battlefield at Yorktown</i>

447
00:44:32,046 --> 00:44:34,131
<i>would become our most unlikely ally.</i>

448
00:44:36,633 --> 00:44:38,802
Shut up!

449
00:44:41,221 --> 00:44:43,891
I hated the first British Invasion.

450
00:44:44,558 --> 00:44:46,810
And I hate the second one even more.

451
00:44:47,311 --> 00:44:48,479
Even the Beatles?

452
00:44:49,521 --> 00:44:50,564
Really, Garrett?

453
00:44:52,107 --> 00:44:53,776
Old habits die hard.

454
00:44:54,193 --> 00:44:56,320
Carlisle needs you.

455
00:44:58,822 --> 00:45:00,074
Sounds interesting.

456
00:45:01,241 --> 00:45:02,326
Help!

457
00:45:02,409 --> 00:45:04,370
But first I'd better finish my meal.

458
00:45:04,745 --> 00:45:06,413
Help me! Help!

459
00:45:15,339 --> 00:45:17,383
<i>Each of them was won over.</i>

460
00:45:17,466 --> 00:45:18,884
<i>Each was made to see.</i>

461
00:45:25,682 --> 00:45:29,019
<i>Carlisle convinced his Irish friends
to make the journey to Forks.</i>

462
00:45:30,813 --> 00:45:32,856
<i>Although we were grateful for their help,</i>

463
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:35,734
<i>their thirst for human blood
complicated the situation.</i>

464
00:45:41,281 --> 00:45:44,701
<i>The nomads Rosalie and Emmett sent
were even more unpredictable.</i>

465
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:47,621
<i>Especially Peter</i>

466
00:45:47,704 --> 00:45:50,040
<i>who had fought alongside
Jasper as a newborn.</i>

467
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,836
Lotta red eyes around here.

468
00:45:53,919 --> 00:45:55,838
They agreed not to hunt in the area.

469
00:45:58,674 --> 00:46:00,300
But they'll feed somewhere.

470
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:05,556
<i>As more vampires
set foot in their territory,</i>

471
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:06,723
<i>more Quileutes turned.</i>

472
00:46:07,057 --> 00:46:09,226
<i>Their nature compelling
them to join the pack.</i>

473
00:46:12,229 --> 00:46:14,481
Hey, easy there. Hey!

474
00:46:14,565 --> 00:46:15,983
It's all right.

475
00:46:16,358 --> 00:46:17,901
You're gonna be okay.

476
00:46:21,447 --> 00:46:24,658
<i>Finally, Car/isle and Esme
returned with our last witness.</i>

477
00:46:27,411 --> 00:46:29,538
- How many came?
- Eighteen.

478
00:46:29,913 --> 00:46:31,290
You have some good friends.

479
00:46:31,665 --> 00:46:32,666
And Alice?

480
00:46:35,878 --> 00:46:37,671
We'll all be on Aro's list now.

481
00:46:38,005 --> 00:46:40,257
Centuries on the run.
That's what you've brought me.

482
00:46:40,841 --> 00:46:42,342
Some friend, Carlisle.

483
00:46:43,135 --> 00:46:44,470
Alistair, come meet everyone.

484
00:46:44,845 --> 00:46:48,056
I already told you, if it comes to a fight,
I won't stand against the Volturi.

485
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:49,558
It won't come to a fight.

486
00:46:51,268 --> 00:46:52,895
I'll be in the attic.

487
00:47:01,528 --> 00:47:02,946
He's not a people person.

488
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:07,242
<i>We opened our home to 18 vampires.</i>

489
00:47:07,868 --> 00:47:09,286
<i>Many with gifts of their own.</i>

490
00:47:12,372 --> 00:47:14,333
<i>Zafrina had power over the mind.</i>

491
00:47:15,167 --> 00:47:17,544
<i>She could make anyone see
what she wanted them to.</i>

492
00:47:43,111 --> 00:47:45,872
If she weren't holding my hand right now,
I could swear this was real.

493
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:48,242
I don't see anything.

494
00:47:51,328 --> 00:47:53,539
Edward,
you didn't tell me your wife is a shield.

495
00:47:57,251 --> 00:47:58,585
What's a shield?

496
00:47:59,503 --> 00:48:01,296
The ones I've met are so different.

497
00:48:02,005 --> 00:48:03,382
It's a defensive talent.

498
00:48:04,424 --> 00:48:06,304
It's why I couldn't read your mind,
even before.

499
00:48:06,593 --> 00:48:07,886
It's why Aro couldn't.

500
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:09,680
You have a very powerful gift.

501
00:48:11,014 --> 00:48:12,766
Oh, yeah, she's a shield, all right.

502
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:14,726
Shoulda put her on her ass.

503
00:48:14,935 --> 00:48:17,020
Or your voltage has been exaggerated.

504
00:48:17,938 --> 00:48:19,398
Maybe it only works on the weak.

505
00:48:23,485 --> 00:48:25,279
Garrett, I wouldn't.

506
00:48:31,618 --> 00:48:34,580
You are an amazing woman.

507
00:48:37,207 --> 00:48:39,418
<i>Now, you guys
can do some serious damage.</i>

508
00:48:40,043 --> 00:48:42,421
Which is why you'll need
to control your phasing.

509
00:48:43,589 --> 00:48:47,384
If your mom pisses you off,
you don't want to tear her head off.

510
00:48:57,269 --> 00:48:59,146
Whoever's coming wasn't invited.

511
00:49:37,893 --> 00:49:40,854
Whoopa!

512
00:49:51,823 --> 00:49:53,909
Vladimir, Stefan,

513
00:49:54,534 --> 00:49:55,994
you're a long way from home.

514
00:49:56,411 --> 00:49:58,038
What are they doing here?

515
00:49:58,121 --> 00:50:00,582
We heard the Volturi
were moving against you.

516
00:50:00,832 --> 00:50:02,417
But that you would not stand alone.

517
00:50:03,001 --> 00:50:04,586
We didn't do what we were accused of.

518
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:07,506
We do not care what you did, Carlisle.

519
00:50:07,631 --> 00:50:09,800
We have been waiting a millennium

520
00:50:10,217 --> 00:50:13,804
for the Italian scum to be challenged.

521
00:50:14,388 --> 00:50:16,556
It's not our plan to fight the Volturi.

522
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:17,933
Shame.

523
00:50:18,517 --> 00:50:21,144
Aro's witnesses will be so disappointed.

524
00:50:21,353 --> 00:50:23,814
They enjoy a good fight.

525
00:50:25,982 --> 00:50:27,275
Aro's witnesses?

526
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:28,402
VLADIMIR; Aww.

527
00:50:28,694 --> 00:50:30,529
Still hoping they'll listen?

528
00:50:32,572 --> 00:50:35,033
<i>When Aro
wants someone from a coven</i>

529
00:50:35,117 --> 00:50:39,162
it's never long before evidence turns up
proving that coven committed some crime.

530
00:50:39,246 --> 00:50:40,622
So he's done this before?

531
00:50:40,872 --> 00:50:44,042
It happens so rarely,
I never realized it was a pattern.

532
00:50:44,167 --> 00:50:47,921
Apparently he always pardons one person
whose thoughts he claims are repentant.

533
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:50,132
This person always has an ability.

534
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:52,759
And they're always given
a place with the Guard.

535
00:50:52,884 --> 00:50:54,302
This is all about Alice.

536
00:50:54,928 --> 00:50:57,389
- He has no one like her.
- Which is why she left.

537
00:50:57,514 --> 00:50:58,890
Why does he need witnesses?

538
00:50:59,015 --> 00:51:01,560
To spread the word
that justice has been served.

539
00:51:02,269 --> 00:51:04,438
After he slaughters an entire coven.

540
00:51:08,442 --> 00:51:10,110
Benjamin, Tia,

541
00:51:10,193 --> 00:51:12,279
- we're leaving.
- And where will you go?

542
00:51:12,779 --> 00:51:14,948
What makes you think
they'll be satisfied with Alice?

543
00:51:15,699 --> 00:51:17,868
What's to stop them
from going after Benjamin next?

544
00:51:17,993 --> 00:51:19,119
Or Zafrina or Kate

545
00:51:19,244 --> 00:51:21,004
or anyone else with a gift?
Anyone they want.

546
00:51:21,329 --> 00:51:22,930
Their goal isn't punishment, it's power.

547
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:24,332
It's acquisition.

548
00:51:24,708 --> 00:51:26,835
Carlisle might not ask you
to fight, but I will.

549
00:51:27,335 --> 00:51:30,172
For the sake of my family.
But also for yours.

550
00:51:31,256 --> 00:51:32,883
And for the way you want to live.

551
00:51:41,308 --> 00:51:42,476
The packs will fight.

552
00:51:43,477 --> 00:51:45,479
We've never been afraid of vampires.

553
00:51:47,481 --> 00:51:48,607
We Will fight.

554
00:51:49,649 --> 00:51:52,152
This won't be the first time
I fought a king's rule.

555
00:51:53,153 --> 00:51:54,488
We'll join you.

556
00:51:54,613 --> 00:51:55,614
No.

557
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:58,825
I will do the right thing, Amun.

558
00:51:59,117 --> 00:52:00,827
You may do as you please.

559
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,165
We will stand with you.

560
00:52:05,499 --> 00:52:06,583
So will we.

561
00:52:10,921 --> 00:52:12,672
That didn't take much.

562
00:52:13,673 --> 00:52:15,425
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

563
00:52:15,926 --> 00:52:17,093
We'll see.

564
00:52:26,603 --> 00:52:28,021
<i>Everyone showed courage.</i>

565
00:52:29,022 --> 00:52:31,483
<i>Though we knew that Aro's army</i>
<i>was moving against us.</i>

566
00:52:32,776 --> 00:52:35,195
<i>Soon we would face the dark gifts of Jane.</i>

567
00:52:35,612 --> 00:52:38,281
<i>And worse, the paralyzing vapor
of her brother Alec</i>

568
00:52:39,449 --> 00:52:41,993
<i>who could rob you of
sight, sound and touch.</i>

569
00:52:59,052 --> 00:53:00,386
I refused him!

570
00:53:00,387 --> 00:53:00,428
I refused him!

571
00:53:00,846 --> 00:53:02,764
I'm not with Carlisle!

572
00:53:11,231 --> 00:53:12,399
Alec?

573
00:53:33,795 --> 00:53:35,213
I will never go against you.

574
00:53:35,589 --> 00:53:37,132
Of course not,

575
00:53:37,924 --> 00:53:40,594
my dear Toshiro.

576
00:53:58,236 --> 00:54:02,449
It seems Carlisle is still expecting you.

577
00:54:11,875 --> 00:54:14,878
Carlisle is all but ensuring
his own destruction.

578
00:54:16,296 --> 00:54:17,464
Sad,

579
00:54:18,381 --> 00:54:19,633
isn't it?

580
00:54:20,926 --> 00:54:23,595
<i>Aro will want us incapacitated
before he attacks.</i>

581
00:54:24,054 --> 00:54:27,724
Jane and Alec will try and take me out first
because I can anticipate their moves.

582
00:54:27,807 --> 00:54:29,434
Too bad we don't all have your shield.

583
00:54:30,226 --> 00:54:31,811
Doesn't help me fight, though.

584
00:54:31,937 --> 00:54:32,979
No, but you could help the rest of us,

585
00:54:33,146 --> 00:54:34,314
if you could project it.

586
00:54:34,439 --> 00:54:35,565
What do you mean?

587
00:54:35,649 --> 00:54:37,150
I mean shield someone other than yourself.

588
00:54:37,233 --> 00:54:38,318
Is that possible?

589
00:54:38,401 --> 00:54:40,403
Gifts can be developed. Over time.

590
00:54:40,487 --> 00:54:42,322
At first, mine was just in my palms.

591
00:54:42,739 --> 00:54:44,783
Now I can radiate it all over my body.

592
00:54:44,908 --> 00:54:46,868
How do you do it?

593
00:54:47,827 --> 00:54:49,788
Tell me.

594
00:54:49,996 --> 00:54:51,498
You need to visualize it.

595
00:54:52,832 --> 00:54:54,292
See how it moves.

596
00:54:57,253 --> 00:54:58,505
What color it is.

597
00:54:59,881 --> 00:55:01,633
Now picture it expanding.

598
00:55:03,009 --> 00:55:04,678
Will it to go beyond you.

599
00:55:17,857 --> 00:55:19,859
I think she needs something
to motivate her.

600
00:55:25,865 --> 00:55:28,034
- No.
- It's all right, I can take it.

601
00:55:28,201 --> 00:55:29,494
He says that now.

602
00:55:29,703 --> 00:55:32,205
Focus, Bella, or he's gonna be hurting.

603
00:55:34,624 --> 00:55:36,501
Edward, I'm not ready to do this yet.

604
00:55:38,503 --> 00:55:40,023
I'm sorry. I said that I wasn't ready.

605
00:55:40,463 --> 00:55:41,965
Dude, you're not motivating her.

606
00:55:42,048 --> 00:55:43,049
You want to try?

607
00:55:54,394 --> 00:55:55,395
Kate!

608
00:55:55,979 --> 00:55:57,564
You seem to lack incentive.

609
00:55:57,689 --> 00:55:59,399
Shall I go see if Renesmee's awake?

610
00:55:59,858 --> 00:56:00,900
Are you crazy?

611
00:56:02,402 --> 00:56:03,403
All right.

612
00:56:03,528 --> 00:56:05,113
This one's on full power.

613
00:56:39,689 --> 00:56:41,733
It's painful, but it's bearable.

614
00:56:48,156 --> 00:56:49,282
Okay, we should go again.

615
00:56:50,366 --> 00:56:51,367
Emmett.

616
00:56:52,702 --> 00:56:53,703
I'm good.

617
00:56:54,662 --> 00:56:56,164
<i>"There's sweet music here that"</i>

618
00:56:56,289 --> 00:57:00,668
"softer falls
than petals from blown roses on the grass."

619
00:57:01,961 --> 00:57:05,006
"Or night dews on still
waters between walls"

620
00:57:05,882 --> 00:57:08,343
"of shadowy granite in a gleaming pass."

621
00:57:11,096 --> 00:57:14,933
"Music that brings
sweet sleep down from the blissful skies."

622
00:57:28,988 --> 00:57:30,073
Mom.

623
00:57:31,825 --> 00:57:34,786
Did Aunt Alice and Uncle Jasper run away

624
00:57:35,203 --> 00:57:36,913
because we're gonna die?

625
00:57:42,377 --> 00:57:43,419
No.

626
00:57:47,215 --> 00:57:49,551
I think they left to keep us safer.

627
00:57:50,343 --> 00:57:52,637
That's what all these
other people are here for, too.

628
00:57:53,847 --> 00:57:56,141
I'll never let anybody hurt you.

629
00:58:03,189 --> 00:58:04,941
Come here. Go to sleep.

630
00:58:25,086 --> 00:58:26,504
It's strange.

631
00:58:27,755 --> 00:58:30,592
Physically, I feel like I
could demolish a tank.

632
00:58:31,259 --> 00:58:33,761
Mentally, I just feel drained.

633
00:58:38,516 --> 00:58:39,726
How about a bath?

634
00:58:59,746 --> 00:59:01,623
I do remember how to undress myself.

635
00:59:02,415 --> 00:59:04,417
Yeah, I just do it so much better.

636
00:59:12,425 --> 00:59:13,593
Bella,

637
00:59:16,137 --> 00:59:19,057
I've had a bad habit of
underestimating you.

638
00:59:22,101 --> 00:59:23,895
Every obstacle you've faced,

639
00:59:25,271 --> 00:59:27,148
I'd think you couldn't overcome it.

640
00:59:29,609 --> 00:59:30,944
And you just did.

641
00:59:32,612 --> 00:59:34,906
You're the reason
they have something to fight for.

642
00:59:36,908 --> 00:59:38,243
My family.

643
00:59:55,176 --> 00:59:56,636
I'm gonna get the water running.

644
01:00:30,837 --> 01:00:32,839
<i>Alice made sure
only I would get the message.</i>

645
01:00:33,673 --> 01:00:36,009
<i>Because only my mind
would be safe from Aro.</i>

646
01:00:43,808 --> 01:00:45,977
<i>I'm surprised
you took a break from Jedi training.</i>

647
01:00:46,853 --> 01:00:49,856
If I don't take Renesmee to my dad,
he'll come to us.

648
01:00:51,190 --> 01:00:53,526
27 vampires, one human.

649
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:55,570
Not so great.

650
01:00:56,529 --> 01:00:58,489
I know that's what you told Edward.

651
01:01:02,201 --> 01:01:04,370
Whatever.

652
01:01:05,705 --> 01:01:08,541
I'm just glad to get away from
all those reeking bloodsuckers.

653
01:01:11,669 --> 01:01:12,670
I'm sorry.

654
01:01:13,212 --> 01:01:14,380
I know.

655
01:01:14,714 --> 01:01:16,382
They're the good guys.

656
01:01:18,092 --> 01:01:19,093
But come on,

657
01:01:19,427 --> 01:01:21,554
Dracula One and Two are

658
01:01:24,932 --> 01:01:26,559
creepy.

659
01:01:39,906 --> 01:01:41,532
There she is. Come here.

660
01:01:43,409 --> 01:01:45,578
Look at you.

661
01:01:45,912 --> 01:01:47,080
You've grown half a foot!

662
01:01:47,914 --> 01:01:48,915
Seriously.

663
01:01:49,582 --> 01:01:50,792
Like 6 inches.

664
01:01:52,126 --> 01:01:53,836
Come on inside. Lunch is on the table.

665
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,296
We got a tree to decorate?

666
01:01:55,546 --> 01:01:58,299
I've actually got a few
errands to run, guys.

667
01:01:58,383 --> 01:01:59,717
I'll be back soon, okay?

668
01:02:01,886 --> 01:02:03,721
Come on. Let's go.

669
01:02:11,521 --> 01:02:13,606
<i>Alice's note
gave me a new sense of hope.</i>

670
01:02:14,607 --> 01:02:16,609
<i>Maybe she had a plan for us after all.</i>

671
01:02:17,777 --> 01:02:19,737
<i>And maybe J. Jenks was the key.</i>

672
01:02:42,635 --> 01:02:44,929
- I'm meeting Mr. Jenks.
- Right this way.

673
01:02:48,141 --> 01:02:50,143
- Mrs. Cullen.
- Hi.

674
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:52,061
I'm so happy you called.

675
01:03:05,575 --> 01:03:08,077
I always meet my private clients here.

676
01:03:08,161 --> 01:03:10,246
It's more comfortable than the office.

677
01:03:10,955 --> 01:03:12,373
And it's more public.

678
01:03:14,709 --> 01:03:16,419
What type of work do you do, J.?

679
01:03:16,752 --> 01:03:18,337
Oh, you know, this and that.

680
01:03:19,172 --> 01:03:21,841
It's always different,
which keeps it interesting.

681
01:03:24,093 --> 01:03:25,761
Have you known Alice and Jasper long?

682
01:03:27,013 --> 01:03:30,308
I've been working with them
for more than 20 years.

683
01:03:30,433 --> 01:03:34,312
And my late partner
knew Jasper 15 years before that.

684
01:03:34,395 --> 01:03:35,605
He is,

685
01:03:37,231 --> 01:03:39,317
unusually well-preserved.

686
01:03:41,319 --> 01:03:42,695
Yes, he is.

687
01:03:46,157 --> 01:03:49,911
I trust that Mr. Jasper
is enjoying his vacation.

688
01:03:51,412 --> 01:03:53,623
He didn't tell you where
he was going, did he?

689
01:03:53,748 --> 01:03:56,834
No, no, no,
he just mentioned that he was leaving

690
01:03:56,918 --> 01:03:58,961
when he came by to place his order.

691
01:04:01,088 --> 01:04:03,007
I assume that his order is ready?

692
01:04:03,132 --> 01:04:04,342
Of course.

693
01:04:05,134 --> 01:04:07,136
I've never been late with a delivery.

694
01:04:26,239 --> 01:04:27,823
There a problem?

695
01:04:30,284 --> 01:04:31,285
No.

696
01:04:34,247 --> 01:04:36,647
My husband and I thought
that we'd all be traveling together.

697
01:04:36,666 --> 01:04:38,501
Jasper said only two were traveling.

698
01:04:38,709 --> 01:04:40,211
His instructions were very clear.

699
01:04:40,461 --> 01:04:41,671
It's my mistake.

700
01:04:44,590 --> 01:04:46,467
Apparently, that's not going to happen.

701
01:05:07,822 --> 01:05:09,824
<i>Alice's vision was clear.</i>

702
01:05:13,744 --> 01:05:15,663
<i>Renesmee would have a future.</i>

703
01:05:17,582 --> 01:05:19,500
<i>But Edward and I wouldn't be a pan' of it.</i>

704
01:05:26,007 --> 01:05:27,341
How ya doin'?

705
01:05:47,028 --> 01:05:48,487
<i>"My dearest Renesmee,".</i>

706
01:05:49,196 --> 01:05:51,115
<i>"I thought we would have forever together."</i>

707
01:05:52,074 --> 01:05:54,076
<i>"But forever isn't as long as I 'd hoped."</i>

708
01:05:55,036 --> 01:05:57,121
<i>"I know now why Alice left me clues."</i>

709
01:05:57,747 --> 01:05:59,040
<i>"It was to keep you safe."</i>

710
01:06:00,625 --> 01:06:03,044
<i>"Everything you and Jacob will need
is in this pack."</i>

711
01:06:05,087 --> 01:06:06,380
<i>"Jacob will protect you."</i>

712
01:06:07,131 --> 01:06:09,171
<i>"And he'll help you learn
about the Ticuna legends."</i>

713
01:06:13,137 --> 01:06:14,722
It's a romantic notion, isn't it?

714
01:06:15,514 --> 01:06:18,392
That a righteous few can defy a great evil.

715
01:06:19,602 --> 01:06:23,230
I must admit, you even had me believing.

716
01:06:23,981 --> 01:06:25,107
For a moment.

717
01:06:27,943 --> 01:06:30,363
Well, good luck. You're gonna need it.

718
01:06:35,034 --> 01:06:36,035
Cheers.

719
01:06:46,003 --> 01:06:47,296
The snow is sticking.

720
01:06:48,214 --> 01:06:49,382
Hey, we still have today.

721
01:06:56,972 --> 01:06:59,308
I'm so glad Charlie found somebody
to take care of him.

722
01:07:00,101 --> 01:07:01,560
Bella, no one's giving up here.

723
01:07:04,105 --> 01:07:06,148
All right! Present time! Let's go!

724
01:07:06,816 --> 01:07:08,192
Seth, Leah, stop eating.

725
01:07:10,027 --> 01:07:11,487
Jake, you start. Get it going.

726
01:07:12,363 --> 01:07:14,573
- What did you get me?
- I'm not giving you anything.

727
01:07:15,533 --> 01:07:16,701
Hey! No, come on,
what did you get me?

728
01:07:16,784 --> 01:07:18,244
Well, Dad,
we didn't have time to wrap yours,

729
01:07:18,327 --> 01:07:19,495
but here it is.

730
01:07:25,209 --> 01:07:27,586
It's a 5-day fishing trip to Fraser River.

731
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:29,046
It's for you and Sue.

732
01:07:29,547 --> 01:07:30,840
You leave tomorrow.

733
01:07:31,173 --> 01:07:33,592
That's really nice. Thank you.

734
01:07:34,552 --> 01:07:35,873
Tomorrow? I can't leave tomorrow.

735
01:07:36,095 --> 01:07:37,847
I made arrangements for you at work.

736
01:07:39,348 --> 01:07:40,433
Sneaky.

737
01:07:42,101 --> 01:07:43,602
And extravagant.

738
01:07:44,437 --> 01:07:46,188
And non-refundable, I'm afraid.

739
01:07:48,107 --> 01:07:49,525
You two trying to get rid of me?

740
01:07:52,111 --> 01:07:54,238
Because it's working!

741
01:07:55,448 --> 01:07:57,783
Fraser River.
That means we'll be chasing Cutthroat.

742
01:07:58,534 --> 01:08:00,369
We might even hook
a Rainbow or some Bulls.

743
01:08:01,787 --> 01:08:02,955
Woman knows her trout.

744
01:08:04,457 --> 01:08:06,250
Hey, beautiful. Let me see.

745
01:08:08,210 --> 01:08:09,462
Jacob make this for you?

746
01:08:10,463 --> 01:08:11,464
Wanna put it on?

747
01:08:16,594 --> 01:08:17,803
It's so pretty.

748
01:08:18,429 --> 01:08:19,764
It is really pretty.

749
01:08:40,785 --> 01:08:42,411
That's what I'm talkin' about.

750
01:08:44,663 --> 01:08:46,499
A little pre-battle bonfire.

751
01:08:49,001 --> 01:08:50,836
Telling war stories.

752
01:08:54,256 --> 01:08:56,509
Or just standing there
like frickin' statues.

753
01:08:59,094 --> 01:09:02,014
Name any American battle. I was there.

754
01:09:04,767 --> 01:09:05,935
Little Bighorn.

755
01:09:07,686 --> 01:09:10,189
I came this close to biting Custer.

756
01:09:10,314 --> 01:09:12,107
But the Indians got him first.

757
01:09:13,818 --> 01:09:16,320
Try Oleg's assault on Constantinople.

758
01:09:17,029 --> 01:09:18,864
He didn't win that one on his own.

759
01:09:18,948 --> 01:09:20,241
If you're talking battles,

760
01:09:20,324 --> 01:09:21,804
you're talking the Eleven Years' War.

761
01:09:21,992 --> 01:09:24,537
No one does rebellion like the Irish.

762
01:09:24,662 --> 01:09:26,372
You lost the Eleven Years' War.

763
01:09:26,497 --> 01:09:29,208
Aye. But it was one hell of a rebellion.

764
01:09:30,334 --> 01:09:32,753
When we ruled,
everything came to us.

765
01:09:33,170 --> 01:09:34,213
P FEY,

766
01:09:34,421 --> 01:09:35,506
diplomats,

767
01:09:36,048 --> 01:09:37,174
favor seekers.

768
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:39,760
Such was our power.

769
01:09:40,427 --> 01:09:44,056
But we never put on white hats
and called ourselves saints.

770
01:09:44,181 --> 01:09:47,768
We were honest about what we were.

771
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:51,105
We sat still for a very long time.

772
01:09:52,356 --> 01:09:55,109
We didn't notice we were
beginning to petrify.

773
01:09:57,278 --> 01:10:00,406
Perhaps the Volturi did
us a favor when they

774
01:10:01,282 --> 01:10:03,075
burned our castles.

775
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:06,370
We've been waiting 1,500 years

776
01:10:07,079 --> 01:10:08,622
to return that favor.

777
01:10:11,083 --> 01:10:14,378
We have been ready to do battle for ages.

778
01:10:16,213 --> 01:10:17,756
I can't help thinking,

779
01:10:17,923 --> 01:10:19,425
all these people
are putting themselves in danger

780
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:21,135
because I fell in love with a human.

781
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:22,595
You found your mate.

782
01:10:22,761 --> 01:10:24,096
You deserve to be happy.

783
01:10:25,264 --> 01:10:26,724
But at what cost?

784
01:10:26,807 --> 01:10:28,601
Everyone here has something to fight for.

785
01:10:28,934 --> 01:10:30,102
I certainly do.

786
01:10:41,906 --> 01:10:43,324
Carlisle, I've never thanked you.

787
01:10:46,452 --> 01:10:48,120
For this extraordinary life.

788
01:11:06,597 --> 01:11:08,432
This means "More than my own life."

789
01:11:08,515 --> 01:11:09,934
That's how much I love you.

790
01:11:11,477 --> 01:11:13,604
Tomorrow I'm gonna need you
to stay with Jacob.

791
01:11:15,439 --> 01:11:16,690
No matter what.

792
01:11:17,983 --> 01:11:19,610
Even if I tell him that...

793
01:11:21,820 --> 01:11:23,364
That he has to take you somewhere.

794
01:11:26,283 --> 01:11:27,576
Hey.

795
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:28,827
Baby, it's all right.

796
01:11:30,329 --> 01:11:31,789
You're gonna be safe.

797
01:11:35,542 --> 01:11:36,669
Always.

798
01:12:22,381 --> 01:12:24,049
If we live through this,

799
01:12:25,217 --> 01:12:27,386
I'll follow you anywhere, woman.

800
01:12:30,889 --> 01:12:32,224
Now you tell me.

801
01:12:47,990 --> 01:12:50,951
The Redcoats are coming!
The Redcoats are coming!

802
01:13:28,322 --> 01:13:29,782
Aro's looking for Alice.

803
01:14:27,339 --> 01:14:28,590
Aro,

804
01:14:28,674 --> 01:14:30,843
let us discuss things as we used to.

805
01:14:31,009 --> 01:14:32,344
In a civilized manner.

806
01:14:32,678 --> 01:14:34,471
Fair words, Carlisle.

807
01:14:35,556 --> 01:14:36,932
But a little out of place,

808
01:14:37,015 --> 01:14:39,893
given the battalion
you've assembled against us.

809
01:14:40,352 --> 01:14:43,021
I can promise you, that
was never my intent.

810
01:14:43,647 --> 01:14:45,357
No laws have been broken.

811
01:14:45,858 --> 01:14:47,025
We see the child.

812
01:14:47,526 --> 01:14:49,778
Do not treat us as fools.

813
01:14:49,862 --> 01:14:51,864
She is not an Immortal!

814
01:14:54,449 --> 01:14:56,368
These witnesses can attest to that.

815
01:14:57,870 --> 01:14:59,204
Or you can look.

816
01:15:00,372 --> 01:15:02,541
See the flush of human blood in her cheeks.

817
01:15:02,624 --> 01:15:03,625
Artifice!

818
01:15:04,001 --> 01:15:07,379
I will collect every facet of the truth.

819
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:11,633
But from someone more central to the story.

820
01:15:12,551 --> 01:15:13,677
Edward,

821
01:15:14,678 --> 01:15:18,182
as the child clings to your newborn mate,

822
01:15:19,725 --> 01:15:22,853
I assume you are involved.

823
01:16:36,468 --> 01:16:38,220
I'd like to meet her.

824
01:17:33,275 --> 01:17:35,569
Young Bella.

825
01:17:37,654 --> 01:17:40,032
Immortality becomes you.

826
01:17:48,332 --> 01:17:50,917
I hear her strange heart.

827
01:18:11,730 --> 01:18:12,898
Hello, Aro.

828
01:18:31,249 --> 01:18:32,751
Magnifico!

829
01:18:38,548 --> 01:18:40,258
Half mortal,

830
01:18:40,759 --> 01:18:42,928
half immortal.

831
01:18:43,762 --> 01:18:46,598
Conceived and carried by this

832
01:18:47,307 --> 01:18:48,433
newborn

833
01:18:49,309 --> 01:18:51,603
while she was still human.

834
01:18:51,978 --> 01:18:53,146
Impossible!

835
01:18:55,065 --> 01:18:57,442
Do you think they fooled me, brother?

836
01:19:05,826 --> 01:19:07,786
Bring the informer forward.

837
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:23,969
Is that the child you saw?

838
01:19:29,307 --> 01:19:30,392
I'm not sure.

839
01:19:30,475 --> 01:19:31,852
Jane.

840
01:19:31,977 --> 01:19:34,813
She's changed. This child is bigger.

841
01:19:35,313 --> 01:19:37,149
Then your allegations were false.

842
01:19:37,732 --> 01:19:39,067
The Cullens are innocent.

843
01:19:39,693 --> 01:19:42,362
I take full responsibility for my mistake.

844
01:19:46,533 --> 01:19:47,659
I'm sorry.

845
01:19:53,665 --> 01:19:54,708
Caius, no!

846
01:19:56,501 --> 01:19:57,461
Irina!

847
01:20:05,135 --> 01:20:07,179
{CRACKLING)

848
01:20:11,016 --> 01:20:12,017
Blind them.

849
01:20:18,523 --> 01:20:19,774
Give me my sight back.

850
01:20:20,066 --> 01:20:21,485
Tanya, this is what they want.

851
01:20:21,568 --> 01:20:23,028
If you attack now, we'll all die.

852
01:20:45,592 --> 01:20:47,385
Pain.

853
01:21:22,796 --> 01:21:23,964
It's working.

854
01:21:57,205 --> 01:21:58,957
Aro, you see there's no law broken here.

855
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:01,543
Agreed.

856
01:22:03,211 --> 01:22:05,422
But does it then follow

857
01:22:05,797 --> 01:22:07,841
that there is no danger?

858
01:22:11,928 --> 01:22:14,681
For the first time in our history

859
01:22:16,641 --> 01:22:19,477
humans pose a threat

860
01:22:20,020 --> 01:22:21,563
to our kind.

861
01:22:22,022 --> 01:22:24,524
Their modern technology

862
01:22:24,649 --> 01:22:28,320
has given birth to weapons
that could destroy us.

863
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:33,199
Maintaining our secret

864
01:22:33,491 --> 01:22:35,994
has never been more imperative.

865
01:22:38,413 --> 01:22:41,249
In such perilous times,

866
01:22:42,667 --> 01:22:44,502
only the known

867
01:22:45,337 --> 01:22:46,588
is safe.

868
01:22:48,214 --> 01:22:49,674
Only the known

869
01:22:50,175 --> 01:22:51,760
is tolerable.

870
01:22:51,843 --> 01:22:54,012
And we know nothing

871
01:22:54,179 --> 01:22:58,016
of what this child will become.

872
01:22:59,517 --> 01:23:02,771
Can we live with such uncertainty?

873
01:23:05,607 --> 01:23:08,276
Spare ourselves a fight today,

874
01:23:10,362 --> 01:23:12,072
only to die

875
01:23:13,198 --> 01:23:15,158
tomorrow.

876
01:23:15,241 --> 01:23:16,242
No.

877
01:23:28,922 --> 01:23:29,923
Alice.

878
01:23:30,715 --> 01:23:31,716
Alice!

879
01:23:47,065 --> 01:23:49,067
My dear, dear Alice,

880
01:23:49,442 --> 01:23:52,779
we're so glad to see you here, after all.

881
01:23:52,904 --> 01:23:55,824
I have evidence the child
won't be a risk to our kind.

882
01:23:57,742 --> 01:23:58,910
Let me show you.

883
01:23:59,661 --> 01:24:00,662
Brother?

884
01:24:26,604 --> 01:24:28,440
It doesn't matter what I show you.

885
01:24:30,442 --> 01:24:31,776
Even when you see.

886
01:24:33,153 --> 01:24:35,572
You still won't change your decision.

887
01:24:36,656 --> 01:24:37,782
Now!

888
01:24:48,918 --> 01:24:50,336
Take care of my daughter.

889
01:24:56,509 --> 01:24:58,303
Get them.

890
01:25:24,871 --> 01:25:26,331
Take her away.

891
01:25:28,541 --> 01:25:29,876
Let her go!

892
01:28:54,288 --> 01:28:55,331
Jacob!

893
01:28:56,374 --> 01:28:58,042
Jacob!

894
01:28:58,126 --> 01:28:59,168
Jacob!

895
01:29:00,211 --> 01:29:01,295
Jacob!

896
01:29:05,550 --> 01:29:06,551
Watch out!

897
01:30:27,632 --> 01:30:29,133
Bella!

898
01:32:11,611 --> 01:32:13,070
Finally.

899
01:34:05,349 --> 01:34:06,559
Now you know.

900
01:34:07,518 --> 01:34:08,894
That's your future.

901
01:34:10,062 --> 01:34:12,356
Unless you decide on another course.

902
01:34:12,898 --> 01:34:16,277
We cannot alter our course.
The child still poses a grave threat.

903
01:34:16,861 --> 01:34:18,029
But what if you were sure she could

904
01:34:18,112 --> 01:34:19,905
remain concealed from the human world?

905
01:34:20,406 --> 01:34:21,991
Could we leave in peace?

906
01:34:22,074 --> 01:34:24,201
Of course. But that cannot be known.

907
01:34:25,077 --> 01:34:26,454
Actually, it can.

908
01:35:04,909 --> 01:35:07,328
I've been searching for witnesses of my own

909
01:35:07,411 --> 01:35:09,413
among the Ticuna tribes of Brazil.

910
01:35:09,580 --> 01:35:11,660
- We have enough witnesses.
- Let him speak, brother.

911
01:35:13,209 --> 01:35:14,418
I am half human,

912
01:35:15,211 --> 01:35:16,420
half vampire.

913
01:35:17,463 --> 01:35:18,589
Like the Child.

914
01:35:19,924 --> 01:35:21,759
A vampire seduced my mother,

915
01:35:22,134 --> 01:35:23,928
who died giving birth to me.

916
01:35:24,261 --> 01:35:25,429
My aunt Huilen

917
01:35:26,722 --> 01:35:28,099
raised me as her own.

918
01:35:30,059 --> 01:35:31,435
I made her immortal.

919
01:35:32,978 --> 01:35:34,438
How old are you?

920
01:35:37,900 --> 01:35:39,819
150 years.

921
01:35:41,112 --> 01:35:43,948
At what age did you reach maturity?

922
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:47,618
I became full-grown
seven years after my birth.

923
01:35:48,994 --> 01:35:50,454
I have not changed since then.

924
01:35:55,626 --> 01:35:57,253
And your diet?

925
01:35:57,378 --> 01:35:58,546
Blood,

926
01:35:58,629 --> 01:35:59,755
human food.

927
01:36:00,798 --> 01:36:02,258
I can survive on either.

928
01:36:02,925 --> 01:36:06,804
These children are much like us.

929
01:36:07,138 --> 01:36:10,015
Regardless, the Cullens have been
consorting with werewolves.

930
01:36:10,099 --> 01:36:11,559
Our natural enemies.

931
01:36:24,613 --> 01:36:25,739
Dear ones,

932
01:36:27,616 --> 01:36:29,952
there is no danger here.

933
01:36:31,996 --> 01:36:33,664
We will not fight

934
01:36:34,123 --> 01:36:35,166
today.

935
01:37:03,194 --> 01:37:05,029
Such a prize.

936
01:37:09,325 --> 01:37:12,369
We have them on the run.
Now is the time to attack.

937
01:37:12,536 --> 01:37:13,704
Not today.

938
01:37:17,124 --> 01:37:18,709
You're all fools!

939
01:37:18,959 --> 01:37:20,544
The Volturi might be gone.

940
01:37:21,045 --> 01:37:22,880
But they will never forgive

941
01:37:23,380 --> 01:37:24,715
what happened here.

942
01:38:23,065 --> 01:38:24,441
You have a beautiful family.

943
01:38:32,908 --> 01:38:35,578
She's gonna be around
for a long time, isn't she?

944
01:38:36,954 --> 01:38:38,539
A very long time.

945
01:38:41,625 --> 01:38:42,876
I'm glad she has you.

946
01:38:51,677 --> 01:38:53,429
So should I start calling you "Dad"?

947
01:38:55,222 --> 01:38:56,223
No.

948
01:38:58,851 --> 01:38:59,852
Hey.

949
01:39:03,522 --> 01:39:04,565
Hey.

950
01:39:16,535 --> 01:39:19,371
Yeah. We're all gonna be together now.

951
01:39:58,744 --> 01:40:00,245
I wanna show you something.

952
01:40:02,790 --> 01:40:03,791
What?

953
01:40:34,405 --> 01:40:36,031
I'm Edward Cullen.

954
01:41:34,298 --> 01:41:35,632
How did you do that?

955
01:41:37,176 --> 01:41:38,469
Been practicing.

956
01:41:41,346 --> 01:41:42,639
Now you know.

957
01:41:45,893 --> 01:41:49,146
Nobody's ever loved anybody
as much as I love you.

958
01:41:50,606 --> 01:41:52,399
There's one exception.

959
01:42:03,452 --> 01:42:04,828
Will you show me again?

960
01:42:06,455 --> 01:42:07,998
We've got a lotta time.

961
01:42:10,083 --> 01:42:11,460
Forever.

962
01:42:14,463 --> 01:42:15,589
Forever.
