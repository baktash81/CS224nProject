1
00:01:47,092 --> 00:01:49,094
It's not wise to encourage them,
Miss Sarah.

2
00:01:49,094 --> 00:01:50,596
Your father never believed in it.

3
00:01:51,096 --> 00:01:52,598
Oh, Geoffrey, don't be
such a fuddy-duddy!

4
00:01:53,098 --> 00:01:55,100
Your father paid me well
to be a fuddy-duddy

5
00:01:55,601 --> 00:01:57,102
and I shall continue to be so

6
00:01:57,102 --> 00:01:59,605
until I get you safely home to London.

7
00:02:21,126 --> 00:02:24,129
You're like a little bird.

8
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:25,631
What's he saying?

9
00:02:26,131 --> 00:02:26,632
My dear Miss

10
00:02:26,632 --> 00:02:28,133
unless they speak the King's English.

11
00:02:28,133 --> 00:02:29,635
I'm as much at a loss as you are.

12
00:02:29,635 --> 00:02:33,639
The King's English is fit for selling pigs

13
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:40,145
not for praising the beauty of
such a perfect desert flower.

14
00:02:41,146 --> 00:02:43,649
El-Aziz, leave her alone.

15
00:02:44,149 --> 00:02:45,651
She is under my protection.

16
00:02:48,654 --> 00:02:53,659
Ah, Haboush, and what is
your protection worth?

17
00:02:55,661 --> 00:02:58,163
Five gold coins for the girl

18
00:02:58,664 --> 00:03:01,166
and ten if she is a virgin.

19
00:03:12,177 --> 00:03:14,179
We shall meet again.

20
00:03:14,179 --> 00:03:15,681
Then the English will be dealt with.

21
00:03:26,692 --> 00:03:28,193
Thank you for helping us.

22
00:03:28,193 --> 00:03:31,697
I'm afraid Geoffrey and I would
have been quite lost without you.

23
00:03:31,697 --> 00:03:34,700
The British East India Company
did much business here.

24
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,702
Your father was greatly respected.

25
00:03:36,702 --> 00:03:37,703
And a good friend to me.

26
00:03:37,703 --> 00:03:40,205
Well that last fellow was
certainly a nuisance.

27
00:03:40,205 --> 00:03:43,208
Sheik Abdul El-Aziz is much
more than a nuisance.

28
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:46,211
He is known as Elthatlab... The Jackal.

29
00:03:46,211 --> 00:03:47,713
He is a slaver.

30
00:03:48,213 --> 00:03:50,716
Pray to God you never
meet such a man alone.

31
00:03:51,216 --> 00:03:52,718
Why was he offering you money?

32
00:03:53,218 --> 00:03:55,721
He wanted to buy something
that caught his eye.

33
00:03:56,221 --> 00:03:57,723
My father's watch?

34
00:03:57,723 --> 00:03:59,224
No, you.

35
00:04:00,225 --> 00:04:02,227
He must have been quite taken by you.

36
00:04:02,227 --> 00:04:04,730
He offered an extremely
handsome price.

37
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:05,731
Bloody wogs.

38
00:04:05,731 --> 00:04:09,234
Oh, excuse me sir,
I didn't mean you sir.

39
00:04:11,236 --> 00:04:13,238
You must trust no one, Miss Sarah

40
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:15,741
The people of the desert
look upon the Frangi

41
00:04:15,741 --> 00:04:17,242
the foreigners like yourself

42
00:04:17,242 --> 00:04:19,244
much like the hawk
looks upon the sparrow.

43
00:04:20,746 --> 00:04:21,246
Excuse me.

44
00:04:27,252 --> 00:04:30,756
Five gold, ten it's enough.

45
00:04:31,256 --> 00:04:35,761
One, two five, twenty five

46
00:04:37,262 --> 00:04:41,767
five gold, ten, fifteen.

47
00:04:42,267 --> 00:04:46,271
One, two, you can do better than
that it's a mountain girl.

48
00:04:47,272 --> 00:04:51,276
Fifteen, sixteen, seventeen.

49
00:04:55,781 --> 00:04:58,784
Come on, come on
she's a mountain girl.

50
00:04:59,785 --> 00:05:01,787
Ten, fifteen.

51
00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:06,291
Come on, show us your gold.

52
00:05:10,295 --> 00:05:12,297
You english son of the bitch...

53
00:05:12,297 --> 00:05:13,298
go on with the auction.

54
00:05:13,799 --> 00:05:15,801
Today's girls are made of god.

55
00:05:16,802 --> 00:05:18,303
David! What happened?

56
00:05:18,303 --> 00:05:19,304
Nothing, mother.

57
00:05:19,304 --> 00:05:22,307
David! It is a sin against God
to look upon such wickedness.

58
00:05:22,808 --> 00:05:25,310
They are heathens. Non-believers.

59
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,812
They will burn in Hell.

60
00:05:30,816 --> 00:05:33,318
Bashi, I wish only to hire a caravan

61
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:34,820
not to purchase one.

62
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,823
So do not try your thieving
tricks on me, my friend.

63
00:05:39,324 --> 00:05:41,326
I must employ extra guards.

64
00:05:41,326 --> 00:05:44,329
The way to Damascus
is most dangerous.

65
00:05:44,329 --> 00:05:46,832
The sunrise is magnificent
over Baghead.

66
00:05:47,332 --> 00:05:50,335
It would be sad if you were not
around to see the next one.

67
00:05:50,836 --> 00:05:52,337
No, no, watch that trunk.

68
00:05:52,838 --> 00:05:54,339
Careful with that, man.

69
00:05:54,339 --> 00:05:56,341
What's the matter with you?
Are you asleep?

70
00:05:59,845 --> 00:06:01,847
Dr. Hahn's Medical Journal.

71
00:06:01,847 --> 00:06:02,848
It was Sarah's father's.

72
00:06:03,348 --> 00:06:06,351
Lord Scott did not trust any doctor
outside of London.

73
00:06:06,852 --> 00:06:09,354
Not without reason, rest his soul.

74
00:06:10,355 --> 00:06:11,857
Bloody cholera.

75
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:26,371
Excuse me

76
00:06:27,372 --> 00:06:28,874
excuse me, sir.

77
00:06:28,874 --> 00:06:30,876
You, yes you, sir.

78
00:06:30,876 --> 00:06:31,877
How do you do?

79
00:06:31,877 --> 00:06:32,878
My name is McBride.

80
00:06:32,878 --> 00:06:35,380
Reverend James McBride from Boston

81
00:06:35,881 --> 00:06:37,883
my wife Rachel, my son David.

82
00:06:38,383 --> 00:06:39,384
How do you do?

83
00:06:39,384 --> 00:06:40,385
Ahmed Haboush.

84
00:06:40,385 --> 00:06:41,386
This is Miss Scott

85
00:06:42,387 --> 00:06:43,889
and her manservant, Geoffrey.

86
00:06:44,389 --> 00:06:46,391
Bashi, we are loosing precious time.

87
00:06:46,391 --> 00:06:49,394
I wonder if we might join
your private caravan.

88
00:06:49,394 --> 00:06:51,897
We have some money... not much...

89
00:06:51,897 --> 00:06:55,400
the people of God are not
always able to give.

90
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,402
We will be travelling fairly fast.

91
00:06:57,402 --> 00:06:58,904
Perhaps you would be
more comfortable

92
00:06:58,904 --> 00:07:00,906
with one of the large
merchant caravans.

93
00:07:00,906 --> 00:07:05,410
But sir, we have been trying to get to
Damascus for nearly three months.

94
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:07,913
It would be an act of Christian charity.

95
00:07:07,913 --> 00:07:08,914
Oh, yes.

96
00:07:08,914 --> 00:07:12,417
We Moslems have always been
very concerned with Christian charity.

97
00:07:16,922 --> 00:07:18,423
They won't give us any trouble.

98
00:09:55,581 --> 00:09:57,082
Dear Lord

99
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:04,590
bless this food to our use that it may
nature us and give us strength

100
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:09,094
for our journey and for thy holy work
among the heathens

101
00:10:09,094 --> 00:10:10,095
in Jesus' name, Amen.

102
00:10:10,596 --> 00:10:11,096
Bloody camels.

103
00:10:11,096 --> 00:10:13,599
What this country needs is
a fine English coachmaker...

104
00:10:13,599 --> 00:10:16,101
bring'em into the 19th century.

105
00:10:17,603 --> 00:10:18,453
Allah is great...

106
00:12:10,215 --> 00:12:11,717
I'll make us some tea, Miss.

107
00:12:11,717 --> 00:12:13,218
Oh, thank you, Geoffrey.

108
00:12:28,233 --> 00:12:29,735
David...

109
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:36,742
David, what's keeping you?

110
00:13:48,814 --> 00:13:49,815
Heathens.

111
00:13:50,315 --> 00:13:51,817
Murderers.

112
00:13:53,819 --> 00:13:56,822
Vengeance is mine sayeth the Lords.

113
00:13:57,823 --> 00:13:58,824
Ahhh!

114
00:13:58,824 --> 00:13:59,825
James!

115
00:13:59,825 --> 00:14:01,326
James, no!

116
00:14:03,328 --> 00:14:04,329
Ahhh!

117
00:14:10,836 --> 00:14:11,837
Ahhh!

118
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,841
Mother!

119
00:14:36,361 --> 00:14:37,863
Run, child, run.

120
00:14:37,863 --> 00:14:38,864
Run on the well.

121
00:14:38,864 --> 00:14:39,364
The well?

122
00:14:39,364 --> 00:14:40,866
To the water well. Hurry up.

123
00:14:51,877 --> 00:14:52,878
Well done, sir.

124
00:14:53,378 --> 00:14:54,379
Come on, David!

125
00:14:54,379 --> 00:14:56,381
Hurry up, let's go! Come on!

126
00:15:02,387 --> 00:15:03,388
Hurry up. We've no time.

127
00:15:03,388 --> 00:15:03,889
What about the water?

128
00:15:03,889 --> 00:15:05,891
There's a small cave on one side.
Hurry up.

129
00:15:06,391 --> 00:15:07,392
Oh, Ahmed, come with us.

130
00:15:07,893 --> 00:15:08,894
Quick, hold on, tight!

131
00:15:10,896 --> 00:15:11,897
Agh!

132
00:15:16,401 --> 00:15:17,402
Hurry!

133
00:15:19,404 --> 00:15:20,906
Quickly, into the well.

134
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:39,424
El-Aziz, I delievered them
into your hands as agreed.

135
00:15:39,424 --> 00:15:41,426
I demand my payment.

136
00:15:41,426 --> 00:15:42,427
Payment?

137
00:15:42,427 --> 00:15:43,428
For what?

138
00:15:43,428 --> 00:15:44,930
The girl has escaped.

139
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:46,431
There is little else of value.

140
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:49,434
You have captured many
women, El-Aziz.

141
00:15:49,434 --> 00:15:50,936
They will bring you a good price.

142
00:15:51,436 --> 00:15:53,939
One less will not make you a poor man.

143
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:57,943
The English girl will not be for sale.

144
00:15:57,943 --> 00:15:59,444
She's for me.

145
00:16:09,454 --> 00:16:10,956
This water is foul!

146
00:16:10,956 --> 00:16:12,457
Treacherous dog!

147
00:16:23,468 --> 00:16:26,471
Perhaps that will improve
the water's taste.

148
00:16:36,481 --> 00:16:39,985
Agh, Agh... Thank you, Miss Sarah.

149
00:16:58,504 --> 00:17:02,007
We commend these souls
to thy keeping in the sure

150
00:17:02,508 --> 00:17:08,013
and certain knowledge of the
resurrection and eternal life.

151
00:17:09,515 --> 00:17:15,521
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Amen.

152
00:17:15,521 --> 00:17:17,022
Amen.

153
00:17:46,051 --> 00:17:47,553
Now, now, sir.

154
00:18:56,622 --> 00:18:57,623
Ahh.

155
00:18:58,624 --> 00:19:00,125
Sun's up, Miss.

156
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:01,627
Time we were on our way.

157
00:19:02,628 --> 00:19:03,128
Where are we?

158
00:19:03,128 --> 00:19:05,130
Further than we were yesterday.

159
00:19:05,631 --> 00:19:06,632
Where's the trail?

160
00:19:07,132 --> 00:19:08,133
It's gone, Miss.

161
00:19:08,133 --> 00:19:09,134
What?

162
00:19:09,134 --> 00:19:10,636
We lost it last night.

163
00:19:11,136 --> 00:19:12,137
Don't worry, Miss.

164
00:19:12,638 --> 00:19:14,640
We'll head due west.

165
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,642
Should we miss Damascus

166
00:19:17,142 --> 00:19:18,644
we'll still reach Alexandria.

167
00:19:19,144 --> 00:19:20,145
Alexandria?

168
00:19:21,146 --> 00:19:23,649
That's hundreds of miles from Baghdad.

169
00:19:23,649 --> 00:19:25,150
It could take us months.

170
00:19:25,651 --> 00:19:27,653
What about food and water?

171
00:19:27,653 --> 00:19:29,154
I don't know, Miss.

172
00:19:29,655 --> 00:19:33,158
All I know is we'll die if we don't move.

173
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,161
Then let's go.

174
00:19:39,665 --> 00:19:41,166
And we'll die if we do.

175
00:19:42,668 --> 00:19:45,170
Water! I found water.

176
00:19:56,682 --> 00:19:57,683
Down here.

177
00:20:01,687 --> 00:20:03,689
This place must be used
by the desert people.

178
00:20:04,189 --> 00:20:05,190
We'll have to be careful.

179
00:20:05,691 --> 00:20:06,692
After you.

180
00:20:06,692 --> 00:20:08,193
It's sweet. I already tried it.

181
00:20:10,195 --> 00:20:11,697
Oh, it's warm.

182
00:20:11,697 --> 00:20:13,198
It's also wet. Try it.

183
00:20:16,702 --> 00:20:21,206
Oh, that's good. Ah, that's so good.

184
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:24,209
Where are you going?

185
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,211
To the camel to get a cup, sir.

186
00:20:29,715 --> 00:20:30,716
Hey!

187
00:20:30,716 --> 00:20:34,720
Geoffrey! Geoffrey!

188
00:20:36,722 --> 00:20:38,724
I do apologize, Miss.

189
00:20:38,724 --> 00:20:40,225
This is quite unforgivable.

190
00:20:40,225 --> 00:20:41,727
No... shush... quiet.

191
00:20:55,741 --> 00:20:57,743
Does it say what to do for him?

192
00:20:57,743 --> 00:21:00,245
No, I can't find anything.

193
00:21:00,245 --> 00:21:02,247
It's all kind of technical.

194
00:21:14,259 --> 00:21:15,260
You look funny.

195
00:21:16,762 --> 00:21:18,263
So do you.

196
00:21:20,766 --> 00:21:22,768
We shouldn't be looking at this.

197
00:21:23,268 --> 00:21:24,269
Why not?

198
00:21:24,269 --> 00:21:25,771
Could be a sin.

199
00:21:26,772 --> 00:21:28,273
But they're beautiful.

200
00:21:28,273 --> 00:21:31,777
How could looking at something
so beautiful be a sin?

201
00:21:32,778 --> 00:21:35,781
My father told me it was wrong
to look upon nakedness.

202
00:21:36,782 --> 00:21:38,784
Well, Adam and Eve were naked.

203
00:21:38,784 --> 00:21:39,785
They were not.

204
00:21:39,785 --> 00:21:42,287
They wore leaves. Big ones.

205
00:21:43,288 --> 00:21:45,290
How do you know? Where you there?

206
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:49,795
No, but I've seen lots of pictures in
churches and they always wore leaves.

207
00:21:51,797 --> 00:21:53,298
Hmm... well...

208
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:56,301
Anyways, this is, this is defferent.

209
00:21:56,301 --> 00:21:57,803
This is a book for doctors.

210
00:21:58,303 --> 00:22:00,806
Doctors have to look at you
with no clothes on.

211
00:22:01,807 --> 00:22:04,309
The doctors have no clothes on?

212
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:09,815
No, you have no clothes on,
the doctor's dressed.

213
00:22:39,845 --> 00:22:43,849
Huh... this thing works!

214
00:24:26,952 --> 00:24:28,453
The mighty hunter returns.

215
00:24:28,453 --> 00:24:29,454
Shhhh.

216
00:24:30,956 --> 00:24:34,459
Oh. How's Geoffrey?

217
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,961
He's still asleep.

218
00:24:35,961 --> 00:24:36,461
Oh.

219
00:24:36,962 --> 00:24:37,963
Did you see anything?

220
00:24:38,964 --> 00:24:40,465
Yep. I sure did.

221
00:24:41,967 --> 00:24:42,968
What?

222
00:24:43,969 --> 00:24:44,970
This.

223
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:46,471
Oh!

224
00:24:49,975 --> 00:24:51,476
Well, I'm glad you're feeling better, sir.

225
00:24:51,977 --> 00:24:53,979
Oh, just a tough of the sun, lad,
nothing serious.

226
00:24:54,479 --> 00:24:55,480
Bit more of this fresh air

227
00:24:55,981 --> 00:24:57,482
and I'll be right as rain in the morning.

228
00:24:57,983 --> 00:24:59,985
Then we should be on our way.

229
00:24:59,985 --> 00:25:01,987
We've a long way to go, you know.

230
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,489
To get to where?

231
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:05,991
Home, of course.

232
00:25:06,491 --> 00:25:08,493
Miss Sarah has a boat to catch.

233
00:25:08,994 --> 00:25:12,998
And I'm sure you're anxious
to get back to your people.

234
00:25:15,501 --> 00:25:17,503
My mother and father were all I had.

235
00:25:23,008 --> 00:25:24,009
Thank you.

236
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:54,039
Steady, sir. Steady on now.

237
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:55,040
The Arabs. They're here.

238
00:25:55,541 --> 00:25:56,041
Where?

239
00:25:56,542 --> 00:25:58,043
About a mile away.

240
00:25:58,544 --> 00:25:59,545
Very well, sir.

241
00:25:59,545 --> 00:26:02,047
Take that beast up to the cave
and gather our things.

242
00:26:02,548 --> 00:26:04,049
If you please, sir.

243
00:26:04,049 --> 00:26:05,050
Where are you going?

244
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:06,051
For a closer look.

245
00:26:06,051 --> 00:26:08,053
If they're friendly they could
help us to get out.

246
00:26:08,053 --> 00:26:10,055
No! No, we can't trust anyone.

247
00:26:10,556 --> 00:26:12,057
I shall be very careful.

248
00:26:12,057 --> 00:26:13,559
Now, go. Get packing.

249
00:26:14,059 --> 00:26:16,061
And mind you look after Miss Sarah.

250
00:26:16,061 --> 00:26:19,064
This country's not fit a proper
young lady of breeding.

251
00:26:33,579 --> 00:26:35,080
I wonder what's happened to Geoffrey.

252
00:26:35,581 --> 00:26:37,082
I don't know.

253
00:26:37,583 --> 00:26:38,584
He should be back by now.

254
00:26:40,586 --> 00:26:42,588
I'm going to look for him
he may need help.

255
00:26:42,588 --> 00:26:45,591
Wait! Be sure to come back.

256
00:26:46,592 --> 00:26:49,595
I can't even get on this stupid
camel by myself.

257
00:26:49,595 --> 00:26:51,096
I forget the word to make him kneel.

258
00:26:51,597 --> 00:26:52,097
It's easy. It's...

259
00:26:52,598 --> 00:26:54,600
No. No, don't tell me now.

260
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,602
Just show me later. Alright?

261
00:26:58,604 --> 00:27:06,111
Yeah. The mighty hunter shall return.

262
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:17,623
Come with me, Ahmed, Ahmed,
come with me.

263
00:27:21,126 --> 00:27:22,628
Where is the boy?

264
00:27:22,628 --> 00:27:25,130
It's mine, it's mine... no, I want it
Bad girl.

265
00:27:25,631 --> 00:27:27,633
Where were you? What were you doing.

266
00:27:27,633 --> 00:27:30,636
Where is the boy, where is the boy?

267
00:27:31,637 --> 00:27:33,639
Ah, I'm not hungry, I'm tired.

268
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:40,145
The men have left us alone and
we're here with nothing to do.

269
00:28:01,166 --> 00:28:02,668
Sarah's trunk.

270
00:28:48,714 --> 00:28:50,215
We'll look again tomorrow.

271
00:28:50,716 --> 00:28:52,217
The girl cannot be far away.

272
00:28:52,718 --> 00:28:54,720
Lying English. Pooh!

273
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,723
Who would believe he would
send us on a false trail.

274
00:28:57,723 --> 00:29:00,726
Ha, indeed. He died more
bravely than I thought.

275
00:29:19,244 --> 00:29:20,095
Sarah... Sarah...

276
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:27,252
The camel, we've got to get out of here.

277
00:29:27,753 --> 00:29:28,253
Well, what happened?

278
00:29:28,754 --> 00:29:29,755
Where's Geoffrey?

279
00:29:29,755 --> 00:29:30,255
The Jackal killed him.

280
00:29:30,756 --> 00:29:31,757
They did awful things to him.

281
00:29:31,757 --> 00:29:33,759
God, let's get out of here
before he finds us!

282
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,761
He's...

283
00:29:35,761 --> 00:29:37,262
they've killed him.

284
00:29:37,763 --> 00:29:39,765
Oh, no.

285
00:29:40,265 --> 00:29:41,767
Sarah, we got to get outta here.

286
00:29:58,784 --> 00:30:00,786
How long have we been gone?

287
00:30:02,287 --> 00:30:04,289
What does it matter?

288
00:30:05,791 --> 00:30:09,294
We just can't give up... we can't.

289
00:30:14,299 --> 00:30:16,802
We'll never get home, will we?

290
00:31:13,358 --> 00:31:14,359
What's the matter?

291
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:14,860
I don't know.

292
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,361
I can't get him to move.

293
00:31:26,371 --> 00:31:27,372
Well, that's it then.

294
00:31:27,372 --> 00:31:29,374
We've had it. We can't walk out.

295
00:31:29,374 --> 00:31:30,876
We've dead.

296
00:31:31,376 --> 00:31:31,877
Ugh!

297
00:31:37,883 --> 00:31:38,884
David, where are you going?

298
00:31:39,384 --> 00:31:40,385
What's the difference?

299
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:45,891
Come on.

300
00:31:49,895 --> 00:31:51,396
David!

301
00:31:53,899 --> 00:31:56,902
Help, David, the camel.

302
00:31:57,402 --> 00:32:01,907
David! David, help!

303
00:32:01,907 --> 00:32:02,908
Sarah!

304
00:32:05,911 --> 00:32:07,412
Sarah, wait for me.

305
00:32:07,913 --> 00:32:10,415
I can't stop the camel!

306
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,443
Sarah, Where are you?

307
00:33:00,465 --> 00:33:01,967
Sarah!

308
00:33:13,979 --> 00:33:15,480
Sarah!

309
00:33:32,998 --> 00:33:33,999
Got a reservation?

310
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,504
Whoo-hooh! Ha, ha, ha!

311
00:33:39,505 --> 00:33:42,007
I don't believe it. I don't believe it!

312
00:33:47,012 --> 00:33:49,014
Ah, that look good... looks good.
Hurry up.

313
00:33:52,518 --> 00:33:54,019
I'm going to be in first.

314
00:33:54,019 --> 00:33:55,020
No, you won't.

315
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,022
I'm going to be in first. You're slow.

316
00:33:57,523 --> 00:33:58,524
You wanna make a bet?

317
00:33:58,524 --> 00:33:59,525
Oh, oh.

318
00:34:02,027 --> 00:34:03,028
I'm too slow?

319
00:34:03,028 --> 00:34:04,530
Yeah, I'm going in first.

320
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:06,031
No, you're going in last.

321
00:34:08,033 --> 00:34:09,535
Hurry up, hurry up, come on.

322
00:34:09,535 --> 00:34:12,037
Hurry up... Hurry up or I'm going in
without you if you don't hurry up.

323
00:34:12,037 --> 00:34:13,539
Come on, come on. Ready...

324
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:14,540
Yeah.

325
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,040
Set...

326
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,041
Go!

327
00:35:10,095 --> 00:35:11,597
Can we stay here?

328
00:35:11,597 --> 00:35:16,101
I'm not moving until at least, forever.

329
00:35:19,104 --> 00:35:22,107
Mmmm... it's so quiet.

330
00:35:22,608 --> 00:35:26,612
Sometimes it feels like we're the only
two people left in the world.

331
00:35:27,613 --> 00:35:29,615
Our very own paradise...

332
00:35:29,615 --> 00:35:31,116
that's what it's called in the Bible.

333
00:35:31,617 --> 00:35:33,118
Paradise.

334
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:35,621
I like that.

335
00:35:37,122 --> 00:35:40,125
I wonder what the first house
looked like.

336
00:35:54,139 --> 00:36:00,145
Sarah... Sarah is that you?

337
00:36:02,147 --> 00:36:03,148
Sarah?

338
00:36:04,149 --> 00:36:05,651
Where did that come from?

339
00:36:05,651 --> 00:36:06,652
I made it.

340
00:36:07,152 --> 00:36:11,657
You make it? It's great.

341
00:36:11,657 --> 00:36:13,659
I didn't know you could make things.

342
00:36:13,659 --> 00:36:15,160
Well, you made this house.

343
00:36:15,661 --> 00:36:17,162
I didn't know you could
make things either.

344
00:36:22,668 --> 00:36:23,669
Try it.

345
00:36:34,179 --> 00:36:37,683
It's beautiful. Really beautiful.

346
00:36:38,183 --> 00:36:39,184
David. What was that?

347
00:36:40,185 --> 00:36:42,688
I don't know. Stay here.

348
00:36:43,188 --> 00:36:44,690
Wait. Maybe it'll go away.

349
00:36:45,691 --> 00:36:46,191
Maybe it won't.

350
00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:56,201
Alright, hold it right there, buster.

351
00:36:57,202 --> 00:37:00,205
Sarah, come here quick. Look.

352
00:37:01,707 --> 00:37:03,709
Ahhh, it's a dinner guest.

353
00:37:03,709 --> 00:37:05,210
Think he's friendly?

354
00:37:05,711 --> 00:37:07,713
Well, he's eating my cooking
and not complaining.

355
00:37:08,213 --> 00:37:09,715
What can be friendlier that that?

356
00:37:18,223 --> 00:37:21,226
Sarah... Sarah.

357
00:37:22,728 --> 00:37:24,229
Come here, I won't hurt you.

358
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:29,735
This is David and I'm Sarah.
Nice to meet you.

359
00:37:31,737 --> 00:37:32,738
Here.

360
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:36,241
You speak pretty good chimpanzee.

361
00:37:47,753 --> 00:37:49,254
Well, what shall we name him?

362
00:37:49,755 --> 00:37:53,258
I don't know. How about Doc?

363
00:37:53,258 --> 00:37:55,761
Doc? Why Doc?

364
00:37:55,761 --> 00:37:58,263
We have to have someone who
can read that medical book.

365
00:37:59,264 --> 00:38:01,266
OK... Doc it is.

366
00:38:30,295 --> 00:38:32,297
Just what I need, a critic.

367
00:39:38,363 --> 00:39:40,365
Hi, have a nice day?

368
00:40:01,386 --> 00:40:01,887
What's the matter?

369
00:40:01,887 --> 00:40:03,889
Something wrong with your back?

370
00:40:03,889 --> 00:40:04,890
No.

371
00:40:06,391 --> 00:40:07,392
Then, what's the matter?

372
00:40:08,894 --> 00:40:11,396
David... tell me...

373
00:40:11,897 --> 00:40:12,898
do I look any bigger?

374
00:40:15,901 --> 00:40:18,904
Taller you mean? Maybe.

375
00:40:18,904 --> 00:40:20,906
No, not taller. Bigger.

376
00:40:22,908 --> 00:40:23,909
Oh, you mean fat?

377
00:40:24,409 --> 00:40:25,410
No, forget it.

378
00:40:26,912 --> 00:40:28,413
Sarah, what do you mean?

379
00:40:29,414 --> 00:40:31,416
Sarah, what are you talking about?

380
00:40:31,416 --> 00:40:33,418
I said forget it. It doesn't matter.

381
00:40:34,419 --> 00:40:35,921
Well, I'm not mind reader, you know.

382
00:40:37,422 --> 00:40:37,923
No, just blind.

383
00:40:40,425 --> 00:40:41,927
Sarah, wa...

384
00:40:44,429 --> 00:40:45,931
Do you know what she's talking about?

385
00:40:45,931 --> 00:40:46,932
Do you know what she's...

386
00:40:47,432 --> 00:40:48,433
I don't know what she's talking about.

387
00:40:48,433 --> 00:40:49,935
Nobody knows what she's talking about.

388
00:40:51,436 --> 00:40:53,438
Women! Aghhh!

389
00:42:46,051 --> 00:42:47,553
Shhhh.

390
00:42:51,056 --> 00:42:52,558
Aghhh!

391
00:43:03,068 --> 00:43:07,072
Sarah. Did you put that thing on me?

392
00:43:08,073 --> 00:43:10,075
No, Doc did it.

393
00:43:11,577 --> 00:43:13,078
Doc, did you do it?

394
00:43:15,581 --> 00:43:17,082
Hmmmmmhumm.

395
00:43:18,083 --> 00:43:20,085
Now you've had it.

396
00:43:20,586 --> 00:43:22,087
Tattletale.

397
00:43:22,588 --> 00:43:23,589
Thanks, Doc.

398
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:27,092
Sarah, come back here.

399
00:43:30,596 --> 00:43:32,097
Sarah, when I get a hold of you.

400
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:34,600
Come back here!

401
00:43:38,604 --> 00:43:42,107
Sarah, I told you when
I getta hold of you!

402
00:43:43,108 --> 00:43:44,610
Will you ever do that to me again?

403
00:43:46,111 --> 00:43:49,114
Huh? Promise?

404
00:43:49,615 --> 00:43:50,616
No.

405
00:43:51,116 --> 00:43:53,118
Promise.

406
00:43:53,619 --> 00:43:56,121
I promise. I promise!

407
00:43:57,122 --> 00:43:59,625
I promise, I promise.

408
00:44:00,626 --> 00:44:02,628
I'll never lay a fingeron your
gorgeous body ever again.

409
00:44:02,628 --> 00:44:03,629
That's better.

410
00:44:04,129 --> 00:44:06,632
I lied... Ahh!

411
00:44:50,175 --> 00:44:52,177
Sarah, are you alright?

412
00:44:52,177 --> 00:44:54,179
Yes, go back to sleep.

413
00:44:54,179 --> 00:44:55,681
Here, cover yourself with this blanket.

414
00:44:55,681 --> 00:44:56,682
What's the matter?

415
00:44:57,683 --> 00:44:59,685
I have stomach pains.

416
00:44:59,685 --> 00:45:01,186
Maybe it was something you ate.

417
00:45:16,702 --> 00:45:19,204
Well, good luck.

418
00:45:19,204 --> 00:45:20,205
I'll need it.

419
00:45:20,706 --> 00:45:22,207
Ha, ha. David, look at Doc.

420
00:45:23,208 --> 00:45:24,209
Hey, hey, stop that.

421
00:45:24,209 --> 00:45:27,212
Stop, Sarah, don't look,
c'mon, don't look.

422
00:45:29,214 --> 00:45:31,717
Doc, get out of here, go on,
go on, get out of here.

423
00:45:32,718 --> 00:45:34,219
Get out of here, Doc!

424
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,222
Come on, get outta here!

425
00:45:40,225 --> 00:45:43,729
I said get out of here, Doc. Go on.

426
00:45:44,229 --> 00:45:46,231
Come on, get outta here, Doc.

427
00:45:50,235 --> 00:45:51,737
It's not funny.

428
00:45:51,737 --> 00:45:52,738
Yes, it is.

429
00:45:52,738 --> 00:45:53,739
It is not.

430
00:45:54,239 --> 00:45:55,240
I bet you do that.

431
00:45:56,742 --> 00:45:57,743
I do not.

432
00:45:58,243 --> 00:45:58,744
Bet you do

433
00:45:58,744 --> 00:46:00,095
the books says all boys do.

434
00:46:00,095 --> 00:46:01,246
It's a natural thing.

435
00:46:02,247 --> 00:46:04,750
I do not, it's not natural.

436
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:06,752
People who do that are crazy.

437
00:46:07,753 --> 00:46:09,254
Well then, it's too late.

438
00:46:09,254 --> 00:46:10,756
You're already crazy.

439
00:47:46,852 --> 00:47:48,854
Oh, God, he's back.

440
00:47:53,859 --> 00:47:54,860
Sarah, hurry!

441
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:57,863
David, maybe they'll just go on by.

442
00:47:57,863 --> 00:47:58,864
They won't go on by.

443
00:47:58,864 --> 00:47:59,865
They'll stop for water.

444
00:47:59,865 --> 00:48:02,367
Yeah, but if we leave now,
they'll see us.

445
00:48:02,367 --> 00:48:04,369
Then we'll hide in the dunes
and sneak away tonight.

446
00:48:04,369 --> 00:48:05,871
This is our Paradise.

447
00:48:06,371 --> 00:48:07,873
We can't just leave it.

448
00:48:08,874 --> 00:48:10,876
Wait, David, what about Doc?

449
00:48:13,378 --> 00:48:14,099
Doc...

450
00:48:15,881 --> 00:48:17,382
oh, Doc, where are you?

451
00:48:18,383 --> 00:48:20,385
The camel, Jesus, Sarah, stop it.

452
00:48:25,891 --> 00:48:26,852
Oh, God!

453
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:37,402
It's gone. It's gone.

454
00:48:37,903 --> 00:48:38,403
I couldn't catch the dawn thing.

455
00:48:38,904 --> 00:48:39,905
It ran out into the desert.

456
00:48:39,905 --> 00:48:40,906
David, I'm sorry.

457
00:48:40,906 --> 00:48:41,907
You're sorry.

458
00:48:42,407 --> 00:48:43,408
The only reason we're in this mess

459
00:48:43,408 --> 00:48:44,910
is because you were flirting with
that guy in the marketplace!

460
00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:47,412
David, that's not fair!

461
00:48:47,412 --> 00:48:48,413
Fair!

462
00:48:48,413 --> 00:48:49,915
He killed my mother and father

463
00:48:49,915 --> 00:48:50,916
he killed Geoffrey

464
00:48:50,916 --> 00:48:51,917
and he'll probably kill us.

465
00:48:51,917 --> 00:48:53,418
So don't tell me about fair!

466
00:48:54,419 --> 00:48:55,921
If he just kills me, I'll be lucky.

467
00:49:31,456 --> 00:49:37,963
Come on, let's go, follow me.
Attack them!

468
00:49:47,973 --> 00:49:49,474
Kill them!

469
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,502
I don't believe this.

470
00:50:17,002 --> 00:50:18,003
Two chimps.

471
00:50:18,003 --> 00:50:21,006
Well, we've got a DOc.
Why not an Eve.

472
00:50:21,006 --> 00:50:22,508
Why not Adam?

473
00:50:22,508 --> 00:50:23,509
Take a look.

474
00:50:26,512 --> 00:50:27,012
Eve it is.

475
00:51:23,068 --> 00:51:25,070
It's OK. We'll build a new one.

476
00:51:28,073 --> 00:51:31,076
I didn't like the view anyway.

477
00:51:50,596 --> 00:51:53,098
I'm sorry I yelled at you
when the camel ran away.

478
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:55,100
I know.

479
00:51:55,601 --> 00:51:57,102
I really didn't mean it.

480
00:51:57,603 --> 00:51:59,104
I know you didn't.

481
00:52:01,106 --> 00:52:04,109
I promise I'll never let anything
happen to you.

482
00:52:36,642 --> 00:52:38,143
Son of a bitch.

483
00:52:38,143 --> 00:52:41,146
Oh... sorry.

484
00:54:43,769 --> 00:54:45,270
- Hold on.
- OK.

485
00:54:45,771 --> 00:54:46,772
- You ready?
- uhuh!

486
00:54:47,272 --> 00:54:47,773
Here we go.

487
00:55:16,301 --> 00:55:17,803
That was fun.

488
00:55:23,308 --> 00:55:26,311
David, what are you doing?

489
00:55:27,312 --> 00:55:29,314
Stop, I can't.

490
00:55:29,815 --> 00:55:30,816
I'm sorry.

491
00:55:31,316 --> 00:55:33,318
I just... I don't think I'm ready.

492
00:55:33,819 --> 00:55:35,320
You'll never be ready.

493
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:38,323
It's all because you've been reading
that damn book so much.

494
00:55:38,323 --> 00:55:42,828
David... David, wait.

495
00:55:44,830 --> 00:55:46,331
David, will you wait?

496
00:55:52,838 --> 00:55:54,339
David, don't.

497
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:56,341
Give it to me.

498
00:55:56,341 --> 00:55:57,843
What are you doing?

499
00:55:58,343 --> 00:55:59,344
Please, please don't.

500
00:55:59,845 --> 00:56:00,846
Get away from me.

501
00:56:00,846 --> 00:56:01,346
Leave me alone.

502
00:56:01,847 --> 00:56:03,348
Give it to me.

503
00:56:03,849 --> 00:56:04,850
Come on, David.

504
00:56:05,350 --> 00:56:06,852
You know you're crazy.

505
00:56:06,852 --> 00:56:08,854
You're really crazy, you know that?

506
00:56:08,854 --> 00:56:11,356
Yes, because I've been doing it
by myself too long.

507
00:56:11,857 --> 00:56:12,357
No, don't.

508
00:57:40,445 --> 00:57:41,947
Doc...

509
00:57:42,447 --> 00:57:43,949
Evie, what's wrong?

510
00:58:18,984 --> 00:58:19,985
They've got Sarah.

511
00:58:55,521 --> 00:58:57,022
Here you are, Master.

512
00:58:57,022 --> 00:58:59,024
Thank you.

513
00:59:03,529 --> 00:59:05,531
Where did they find her?

514
00:59:06,031 --> 00:59:08,534
How do I know.

515
00:59:10,536 --> 00:59:14,039
Quiet, quiet.

516
00:59:15,541 --> 00:59:19,044
You need to bathe.
And have fresh clothes.

517
00:59:22,047 --> 00:59:24,550
Then you will be fit to come to me.

518
00:59:33,559 --> 00:59:34,560
How will they dress her?

519
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:36,061
She's a foreigner.

520
00:59:36,061 --> 00:59:38,063
She's English, isn't she?

521
00:59:38,564 --> 00:59:39,064
Damn you.

522
00:59:53,579 --> 00:59:55,080
Hold my horse...

523
00:59:57,082 --> 01:00:02,087
Come on men, follow me.

524
01:00:52,137 --> 01:00:53,138
You two stay here.

525
01:00:53,138 --> 01:00:54,640
I'm going to try and find Sarah.

526
01:00:55,641 --> 01:00:57,643
If I don't come back...

527
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:16,161
I said stay here.

528
01:01:29,174 --> 01:01:31,677
See how long her hair is.

529
01:01:31,677 --> 01:01:33,679
She's a beautiful brunette.

530
01:01:34,179 --> 01:01:35,180
Especially her eyes.

531
01:01:35,681 --> 01:01:37,683
Come on, get away from here, fast...

532
01:01:38,183 --> 01:01:40,686
Come on, get away from here.

533
01:01:42,187 --> 01:01:44,189
- Look, who's that?
- Stop.

534
01:01:44,690 --> 01:01:46,191
God damn you, you little bitch.

535
01:01:48,694 --> 01:01:49,194
I don't know, soraya, I don't know.

536
01:01:50,195 --> 01:01:52,197
Fill the jug with water!...

537
01:01:52,698 --> 01:01:54,199
I told you to fill the jug with water
can't you hear me?

538
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:56,702
I don't know, soraya, I don't know.

539
01:01:57,202 --> 01:02:00,205
Where did she come from?

540
01:02:00,205 --> 01:02:02,207
She look strange... how do I know?

541
01:02:02,207 --> 01:02:04,710
How do I know?

542
01:02:05,210 --> 01:02:06,211
Ahhh!

543
01:02:07,212 --> 01:02:07,713
David!

544
01:02:08,714 --> 01:02:10,215
Son of the Devil!

545
01:02:21,226 --> 01:02:22,728
Am I glad you guys never listen to me.

546
01:02:22,728 --> 01:02:23,729
C'mon.

547
01:02:52,758 --> 01:02:54,760
I couldn't believe it.

548
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:56,762
I looked up and this ugly woman
came in the tent

549
01:02:56,762 --> 01:02:57,763
and I thought. Oh, God, not another one.

550
01:02:57,763 --> 01:03:02,768
And it was you.
You were really fantastic.

551
01:03:02,768 --> 01:03:03,268
Uughh.

552
01:03:04,269 --> 01:03:05,771
David, what's wrong?

553
01:03:05,771 --> 01:03:07,773
Scorpion got me on the arm.

554
01:03:07,773 --> 01:03:10,776
Let me see. Oh, my God.

555
01:03:20,285 --> 01:03:22,287
If only we had the book.

556
01:03:24,289 --> 01:03:25,290
Oh, I shouldn't have made you angry.

557
01:03:25,290 --> 01:03:25,791
I'm sorry.

558
01:03:27,292 --> 01:03:29,795
It wasn't you, it was me.

559
01:03:30,295 --> 01:03:30,796
Shhhh.

560
01:03:31,296 --> 01:03:32,297
I was crazy and now I'm going to die.

561
01:03:32,297 --> 01:03:34,099
No, you're not.

562
01:03:34,099 --> 01:03:34,299
Shhh, don't talk.

563
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:35,801
You're going to be alright.

564
01:03:38,303 --> 01:03:40,305
I'll take care of you...

565
01:03:40,305 --> 01:03:44,810
shhh... it's alright.

566
01:05:02,888 --> 01:05:05,390
Please don't leave me, David.

567
01:05:06,892 --> 01:05:08,393
Don't go away.

568
01:05:09,394 --> 01:05:12,898
Everyone I ever loved went away.

569
01:05:15,901 --> 01:05:17,903
Please, David.

570
01:05:20,906 --> 01:05:23,408
I love you, David.

571
01:05:45,931 --> 01:05:47,432
Sarah.

572
01:05:48,433 --> 01:05:49,935
Oh, David!

573
01:06:07,452 --> 01:06:08,453
David.

574
01:06:08,954 --> 01:06:10,455
Hmmm?

575
01:06:11,957 --> 01:06:14,960
You know, I really thought I'd lost you.

576
01:06:18,964 --> 01:06:21,967
I really thought I was going
to be left all alone.

577
01:06:26,972 --> 01:06:28,473
I'd never leave you alone.

578
01:06:30,976 --> 01:06:32,477
And then last night...

579
01:06:32,978 --> 01:06:34,479
when you didn't move.

580
01:06:34,479 --> 01:06:37,482
I thought of all the things
I wish I'd said to you...

581
01:06:38,984 --> 01:06:40,986
and all the things I wish we had done.

582
01:06:43,488 --> 01:06:44,489
Like what?

583
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:51,997
It's alright.

584
01:06:52,497 --> 01:06:53,498
You're not scared anymore?

585
01:06:53,498 --> 01:06:54,499
No.

586
01:10:52,237 --> 01:10:54,740
Atta boy, Doc... haul him in...
Haul him in, Doc... haul him in.

587
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:55,741
I'll get him.

588
01:11:02,748 --> 01:11:03,749
Too bad, Doc.

589
01:11:04,249 --> 01:11:04,750
He got away.

590
01:11:05,250 --> 01:11:06,251
Must have been a big one.

591
01:11:09,755 --> 01:11:11,757
Spoken like a true fisherman.

592
01:11:56,301 --> 01:11:57,302
Hope you like this.

593
01:11:59,304 --> 01:12:00,806
I made it specially for you.

594
01:12:01,306 --> 01:12:03,308
It took me all day long to make.

595
01:12:06,812 --> 01:12:08,313
Looks real good.

596
01:12:17,823 --> 01:12:19,324
Too spicy?

597
01:12:19,825 --> 01:12:20,826
No. It's perfect.

598
01:12:22,327 --> 01:12:24,329
It's perfect. Oh, OK, then
I'll give you seconds.

599
01:12:24,830 --> 01:12:26,331
No, no, no, no, no... no... I'm full.

600
01:13:53,418 --> 01:13:54,419
Come on in, lazy bones.

601
01:13:54,419 --> 01:13:55,420
The water's great.

602
01:13:55,921 --> 01:13:57,422
No, I'll swim with you tomorrow, OK?

603
01:13:57,422 --> 01:13:58,924
Aw, that's what you said yesterday.

604
01:13:59,424 --> 01:14:00,425
And the day before that.

605
01:14:00,425 --> 01:14:01,927
And the day before that.

606
01:14:02,427 --> 01:14:05,430
The only exercise you've
been getting is this.

607
01:14:07,432 --> 01:14:08,934
Come on, David.

608
01:14:09,434 --> 01:14:10,936
I haven't had a bite all morning.

609
01:14:10,936 --> 01:14:12,938
That's 'cause you ate all night.

610
01:14:13,438 --> 01:14:15,941
David, if you want to see fat,
look at Eve.

611
01:14:24,950 --> 01:14:26,451
We better be moving soon.

612
01:14:26,952 --> 01:14:29,955
Yeah, I know.

613
01:14:46,972 --> 01:14:48,473
Here, Evie.

614
01:14:49,474 --> 01:14:51,476
No, take it in this hand.

615
01:14:54,980 --> 01:14:56,982
No, not your tummy.

616
01:14:59,985 --> 01:15:00,986
Brush your hair.

617
01:15:03,488 --> 01:15:04,990
See how beautiful you are?

618
01:15:06,491 --> 01:15:10,495
Yeah, that's a good girl.

619
01:16:03,549 --> 01:16:05,551
David... come here, quick.

620
01:16:08,554 --> 01:16:09,555
What is it?

621
01:16:10,556 --> 01:16:11,557
Come on, hurry up.

622
01:16:21,066 --> 01:16:22,568
Look, Evie's had her baby.

623
01:16:42,588 --> 01:16:44,089
Come on.

624
01:16:53,098 --> 01:16:55,100
You mean we're going
to have one of these?

625
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:58,103
Uhhuh. Only ours will have
a little less hair.

626
01:17:00,606 --> 01:17:01,607
My God!

627
01:17:06,111 --> 01:17:09,114
Here Doc, take your baby. Take him.

628
01:17:58,163 --> 01:18:00,165
Can't you ever leave us alone?

629
01:18:05,671 --> 01:18:07,673
Sarah, Sarah, we've got
to get out of here.

630
01:18:07,673 --> 01:18:08,674
He's coming.

631
01:18:08,674 --> 01:18:09,675
How did he find us?

632
01:18:09,675 --> 01:18:10,676
How does he ever find us?

633
01:18:10,676 --> 01:18:11,677
Let's get out of here.

634
01:18:12,177 --> 01:18:13,178
Doc... Evie.

635
01:18:14,179 --> 01:18:16,682
Hurry up, come on.

636
01:18:16,682 --> 01:18:18,183
Sarah, let's go.

637
01:18:27,693 --> 01:18:29,194
The tracks are fresh

638
01:18:30,195 --> 01:18:31,697
...wait here.

639
01:18:31,697 --> 01:18:33,699
I will take the girl alone.

640
01:19:44,770 --> 01:19:45,771
Hyaaa! Come on!

641
01:19:53,779 --> 01:19:55,781
David, the camel just
can't run anymore.

642
01:19:55,781 --> 01:19:59,785
He's got to, we've got to keep going.
Hyaaa!

643
01:20:03,288 --> 01:20:04,790
Come on move.

644
01:20:22,307 --> 01:20:23,308
He killed it.

645
01:20:24,309 --> 01:20:26,311
Just like he's killed everything else.

646
01:20:26,812 --> 01:20:27,813
What do we do?

647
01:20:30,816 --> 01:20:31,817
Wait.

648
01:20:31,817 --> 01:20:33,318
Can't we just keep on running?

649
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:38,323
If he's coming, he'll catch us.

650
01:20:39,324 --> 01:20:39,825
If he's not

651
01:20:40,325 --> 01:20:42,327
we'll move at night when it's a lot cooler.

652
01:21:38,383 --> 01:21:39,384
I love you.

653
01:21:41,386 --> 01:21:42,387
I love you too.

654
01:21:49,394 --> 01:21:50,836
He's coming.

655
01:21:50,836 --> 01:21:52,397
I can't see anything, but I know it's him.

656
01:22:02,407 --> 01:22:03,408
Wait here.

657
01:22:05,410 --> 01:22:07,913
David, maybe he'd let us go.

658
01:22:24,429 --> 01:22:25,430
Keep this.

659
01:24:35,561 --> 01:24:37,062
David.

660
01:24:37,563 --> 01:24:38,564
David, are you alright?

661
01:24:44,570 --> 01:24:46,071
David.

662
01:24:53,077 --> 01:24:54,579
It's alright.

663
01:24:54,579 --> 01:24:57,081
I'm OK... I'm OK.

664
01:25:17,601 --> 01:25:18,602
David, be careful.

665
01:25:49,134 --> 01:25:50,636
It's alright, Sarah. He's dead.

666
01:26:54,199 --> 01:26:55,200
My God!

667
01:26:55,701 --> 01:26:57,102
There are people down there!

668
01:26:57,102 --> 01:26:58,103
Civilized people.

669
01:26:59,503 --> 01:27:00,505
A hot bath...

670
01:27:00,706 --> 01:27:03,708
clean sheets... shoes!

671
01:27:04,708 --> 01:27:07,210
And chocolate... chocolate anything!

672
01:27:08,713 --> 01:27:09,714
Oh, no.

673
01:27:10,714 --> 01:27:11,715
Oh, oh David.

674
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:13,380
What?

675
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:14,880
It moved.

676
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:16,680
What are you talking about?

677
01:27:16,780 --> 01:27:18,380
It moved just now, here.

678
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:22,880
It hit me.

679
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:25,380
It's going to be a fighter.

680
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:28,379
Mmm, just like his father.

681
01:27:30,579 --> 01:27:31,379
You're going to need help.

682
01:27:31,579 --> 01:27:33,278
We better get down there.

683
01:27:33,279 --> 01:27:34,379
Yeah, I know.

684
01:27:34,879 --> 01:27:36,879
What about Doc and Evie and the baby?

685
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:39,679
We've got to decide what to do.

686
01:27:39,779 --> 01:27:41,379
It isn't our decision anymore.

687
01:27:42,179 --> 01:27:43,179
Look.

688
01:27:47,379 --> 01:27:49,379
Doc, Eve...

689
01:27:49,879 --> 01:27:51,679
Wait, Doc.

690
01:27:57,879 --> 01:27:59,079
We'd better get going.

691
01:27:59,579 --> 01:28:01,379
Yeah, we'd better.
