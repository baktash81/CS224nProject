00:02:37,131 --> 00:02:40,468
All right, folks.
Last stop. End of the line.

3
00:02:40,552 --> 00:02:42,846
Grab your belongings
and head off the bus.

4
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:43,930
Thank you.

5
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,706
<i>Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

6
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:14,586
<i>to the greatest carnival
in the world.</i>

7
00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:18,089
<i>Spine-chilling attractions,
fun for all ages.</i>

8
00:03:18,172 --> 00:03:20,049
<i>Hurry! Hurry, hurry.</i>

9
00:03:22,385 --> 00:03:25,096
<i>Behold,
the beauties of the Orient,</i>

10
00:03:25,179 --> 00:03:29,309
<i>reenacting forbidden dances
for your education</i>

11
00:03:29,392 --> 00:03:31,019
<i>and pleasure.</i>

12
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,857
<i>Games of chance,
games of skill.</i>

13
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,110
Molly, look what
I got for you. Chocolates.

14
00:03:39,193 --> 00:03:41,571
You ready to go?
You got the sandwiches?

15
00:03:45,617 --> 00:03:49,662
One last chance to
witness this supreme oddity.

16
00:03:49,746 --> 00:03:53,791
I must ask you, however,
to remember that this exhibit

17
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:59,130
is being presented solely in the
interest of science and education.

18
00:03:59,213 --> 00:04:03,051
Where did it come from?
Is it a beast or is it a man?

19
00:04:03,134 --> 00:04:05,637
Come on in.
Come on in and find out.

20
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,770
This creature has been examined
by the foremost scientists

21
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:19,108
of both Europe and the
Americas, and pronounced a man.

22
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:21,611
Unequivocally, a man.

23
00:04:27,408 --> 00:04:30,203
He can go for weeks
with neither food nor drink

24
00:04:30,286 --> 00:04:32,455
and live entirely
on the atmosphere.

25
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:36,626
But you're in luck because tonight
we're going to feed him one last time.

26
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:37,710
Peach.

27
00:04:40,171 --> 00:04:43,257
There will be a slight additional
charge for this attraction,

28
00:04:43,341 --> 00:04:46,844
but it's not a dollar,
not 50 cent, but a quarter.

29
00:04:46,928 --> 00:04:50,056
One fourth of a dollar,
and you will see him feed.

30
00:04:51,099 --> 00:04:52,517
Suckle on the blood

31
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,144
of reptiles and birds...

32
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:59,607
Like a babe feeding on
its mother's milk.

33
00:05:22,005 --> 00:05:24,632
Bite it! Come on!

34
00:05:30,722 --> 00:05:31,723
No.

35
00:05:52,827 --> 00:05:55,747
Come on.
Fourth of a dollar.

36
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,753
25 cents. Pay up.

37
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:12,388
<i>Step right up and get a prize!</i>

38
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:13,848
Hey, mack.

39
00:06:13,931 --> 00:06:15,433
You can't be back here.

40
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,477
You.

41
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,812
You're the cluck
from the bus stop.

42
00:06:19,896 --> 00:06:21,689
You followed me here,
didn't ya?

43
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:23,566
Why?

44
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:24,776
What's your pitch, pal?

45
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:28,613
You on the level?
You need work?

46
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:30,990
He's jus
peddling applesauce.

47
00:06:31,074 --> 00:06:32,992
Major. Major.
Give me a minute.

48
00:06:35,119 --> 00:06:36,913
All right,
we got a storm coming through.

49
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:39,540
I gotta load out fast.
I'm short a few guys.

50
00:06:39,624 --> 00:06:40,792
It's hard work.

51
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,835
You get a dollar, you move on.
No mooching around.

52
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:43,920
Savvy?

53
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:13,449
All right, fellas,
on the count of three.

54
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:14,826
Ready?

55
00:07:14,909 --> 00:07:18,329
One, two, three.

56
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:20,248
Let her down.

57
00:07:20,331 --> 00:07:24,043
Take the post down!
Take the post down!

58
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:58,619
Want I should help you
count it, Rockefeller?

59
00:08:00,288 --> 00:08:01,747
It was a dollar

60
00:08:01,831 --> 00:08:04,584
minus the till
for the Geek Show.

61
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:07,336
That's right.
I clocked you, cluck.

62
00:08:12,466 --> 00:08:14,844
Hey! Hey!

63
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:17,221
I'll give you five
for the radio.

64
00:08:19,182 --> 00:08:22,101
Tell you what,
we're joining another carnival

65
00:08:22,185 --> 00:08:24,604
about 20 miles
down the road.

66
00:08:24,687 --> 00:08:29,567
I'll give you the five,
plus a nice hot meal when we get there.

67
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:31,629
Come on, fellas.
I need help. Chop chop.

68
00:09:32,797 --> 00:09:35,633
Hey, you.
Radio Flyer, come here.

69
00:09:40,304 --> 00:09:41,764
The Geek, he got loose.

70
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:44,600
If you see him,
don't take him on your own.

71
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:45,935
Let's get this fucker.

72
00:09:48,646 --> 00:09:50,523
Look under the truck.

73
00:09:50,606 --> 00:09:53,567
No, keep going.
To the funhouse.

74
00:09:55,653 --> 00:09:56,654
Hurry!

75
00:10:02,243 --> 00:10:03,536
I'll let you in.

76
00:10:11,794 --> 00:10:12,837
You go in there.

77
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,131
If you see him,
push him through.

78
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:16,716
I'll meet you
on the other side.

79
00:11:19,236 --> 00:11:21,530
Hey, pal,
everybody's looking for ya.

80
00:11:25,242 --> 00:11:28,204
Well, I'm not gonna blow the whistle.
You didn't do nothing against me.

81
00:11:29,914 --> 00:11:31,248
Why don't you
come on out?

82
00:11:34,043 --> 00:11:35,586
Come on,
I'm not gonna hurt you.

83
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,053
I am not like...

84
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:45,638
I'm not like this.

85
00:11:51,685 --> 00:11:52,686
Easy.

86
00:11:53,104 --> 00:11:54,355
Easy.

87
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:00,277
Hey!

88
00:12:00,861 --> 00:12:02,488
Hey!

89
00:12:02,571 --> 00:12:05,616
Hey, you're gonna kill him.
Jesus, kid!

90
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:13,082
Aw, jeez, is he dead?

91
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:15,835
I don't need no shooflies in here, Clem.
Get him out of here.

92
00:12:16,544 --> 00:12:17,545
In the back.

93
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:19,964
The cage in the back.

94
00:12:20,047 --> 00:12:21,132
Hell.

95
00:12:24,552 --> 00:12:25,553
Jesus.

96
00:12:30,599 --> 00:12:32,601
Out, out! Go, go, go.

97
00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:35,521
Back!

98
00:12:35,604 --> 00:12:38,149
Back, back, back!

99
00:12:38,232 --> 00:12:40,359
Step right up and behold,

100
00:12:40,443 --> 00:12:44,113
one of the unexplained
mysteries of the universe.

101
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:46,615
Is he man or beast?

102
00:12:48,826 --> 00:12:50,786
I'm not like this.

103
00:12:54,123 --> 00:12:58,461
Folks will pay good money
just to make themselves feel better.

104
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:01,505
Look down on this fucker,

105
00:13:01,589 --> 00:13:03,841
grind some
chicken gristle.

106
00:13:05,342 --> 00:13:06,510
- How's your head?
- Hmm.

107
00:13:09,263 --> 00:13:10,347
Turn.

108
00:13:10,431 --> 00:13:11,682
Oh.

109
00:13:15,311 --> 00:13:21,400
You can find a mattress
over there behind those jars.

110
00:13:21,484 --> 00:13:23,110
You can sleep
there tonight.

111
00:13:24,278 --> 00:13:25,654
Stay out of the rain.

112
00:13:31,452 --> 00:13:33,787
Go on, go on,
around the corner.

113
00:13:41,712 --> 00:13:45,132
Would a steady job be of
interest to you, young buck?

114
00:13:47,051 --> 00:13:49,428
Folks here,

115
00:13:49,512 --> 00:13:53,265
they don't make no never mind
who you are, or what you done.

116
00:14:34,265 --> 00:14:35,266
Hey!

117
00:14:47,903 --> 00:14:49,363
Yeah.

118
00:15:31,572 --> 00:15:32,573
Mornin'.

119
00:15:33,824 --> 00:15:34,867
Mornin'.

120
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,995
You got a tub?

121
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:39,413
Certainly do.

122
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:43,125
Just arrived last night,
so I thought...

123
00:15:45,628 --> 00:15:48,255
Of course you did.

124
00:15:48,339 --> 00:15:52,009
Well, it'll be a dime to use
it, and you get a cake of soap,

125
00:15:52,092 --> 00:15:54,553
and, uh, hot water.

126
00:15:58,599 --> 00:15:59,850
Leave the door open?

127
00:15:59,933 --> 00:16:02,811
Sure. But put that dime
on the table.

128
00:16:05,689 --> 00:16:09,568
Sorry to wake you, sugar.
I'm just getting a soak.

129
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:13,906
I gotta go
into town anyway.

130
00:16:15,032 --> 00:16:16,742
Morning.

131
00:16:16,825 --> 00:16:19,411
And, uh, I'm going to see
about getting some breakfast.

132
00:16:19,495 --> 00:16:21,747
Now, sweetie, make sure
it's breakfast, okay?

133
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:24,124
Promise Zeena you won't go
into some blind pig.

134
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:26,126
Are you familiar
with those cards?

135
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,711
Mm-hmm.

136
00:16:27,795 --> 00:16:29,380
And, uh, tarot.

137
00:16:29,463 --> 00:16:30,839
Very powerful stuff.

138
00:16:35,511 --> 00:16:38,389
Well, maybe Zeena
will read your fortune, uh,

139
00:16:38,472 --> 00:16:40,057
if you're lucky,

140
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,809
after your bath.

141
00:16:47,147 --> 00:16:48,273
You could take
all your things off

142
00:16:48,357 --> 00:16:50,359
and hang 'em over the chair
there, nice and neat.

143
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:53,612
I'll have <i>eggs a la
Benedict,</i> a croissant,

144
00:16:53,696 --> 00:16:58,409
<i>jus d'orange, cafe au lait,</i>
and, uh, ba-bum.

145
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:01,203
<i>Au revoir, ma cherie.</i>

146
00:17:07,334 --> 00:17:08,919
Gonna be helping
Clem out a bit.

147
00:17:10,212 --> 00:17:11,213
Clem, huh?

148
00:17:14,216 --> 00:17:15,926
Say, maybe you can
hawk for me.

149
00:17:16,009 --> 00:17:17,594
You know,
work the audience.

150
00:17:17,678 --> 00:17:19,013
We got a little
mind reading show.

151
00:17:19,096 --> 00:17:20,389
What would I have to do?

152
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:22,975
Ah, ain't nothin' to it.
Carny speak's like a song.

153
00:17:23,058 --> 00:17:27,521
We sound Southern to Southerners
and Western to Westerners.

154
00:17:28,564 --> 00:17:30,649
You got
a sweet little lilt.

155
00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:33,235
Just gotta lean on it.
Talk of the soil.

156
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:36,155
You drawl slow, but all the
while, you're hustling fast.

157
00:17:39,908 --> 00:17:42,411
Yeah, you can
peddle for me.

158
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:46,832
And on your down time,
maybe Pete can show you a trick or two.

159
00:17:46,915 --> 00:17:48,500
You're gonna do just fine,
honey.

160
00:17:48,584 --> 00:17:49,877
You got panache.

161
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:55,549
What is that?

162
00:17:56,258 --> 00:17:57,259
Well,

163
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,179
you're easy on the eyes,
honey.

164
00:18:07,728 --> 00:18:08,979
Oh, you're trouble,
ain't you, pup?

165
00:18:09,062 --> 00:18:10,272
No, ma'am, I'm absolutely
no trouble at all.

166
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:11,356
Oh, yes, you are.

167
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,941
Yes, you are.
You're a "maybe."

168
00:18:14,985 --> 00:18:16,403
And "maybes"...

169
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:21,450
they're real bad for me.

170
00:18:25,954 --> 00:18:27,539
Well, ain't you one.

171
00:18:31,084 --> 00:18:32,836
- I better go.
- Yeah.

172
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:37,216
Just try and get away,
you dope.

173
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:09,039
Take over for me.
My knees are shot to shit.

174
00:19:09,122 --> 00:19:10,999
Always with the knees.

175
00:19:11,834 --> 00:19:13,502
I am The Major!

176
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:15,504
The tiniest man
on record,

177
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:20,092
master of the nami-jitsu,
the secret technique from the Orient.

178
00:19:20,175 --> 00:19:23,887
And $20 says I can beat
any of you yahoos

179
00:19:23,971 --> 00:19:25,681
in a wrestling match.

180
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:26,849
Don't be bashful, folks.

181
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:28,058
If there's any of you
that have a question for me,

182
00:19:28,141 --> 00:19:31,770
Mr. Carlisle will now be collecting
your cards and envelopes.

183
00:19:31,854 --> 00:19:33,605
Make sure to
write your questions

184
00:19:33,689 --> 00:19:36,149
and your name on a card
inside the envelope.

185
00:19:36,233 --> 00:19:37,317
All right, don't look
at anybody else's.

186
00:19:37,401 --> 00:19:38,819
Thank you.

187
00:19:38,902 --> 00:19:40,904
Let's just all just mind our manners,
and we'll stay out of trouble, now.

188
00:19:40,988 --> 00:19:42,614
There are five senses
we all possess.

189
00:19:42,698 --> 00:19:45,033
- Miss Molly, you have a question for us?
- No.

190
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:47,160
All right. Well, you're not
gonna get an answer then.

191
00:19:47,244 --> 00:19:49,288
We all can hear, see,
touch, smell, and taste.

192
00:19:49,371 --> 00:19:52,541
However, I have been
blessed with a sixth one.

193
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:56,545
A natural connection,
if you will, to the ether.

194
00:19:58,422 --> 00:20:01,258
Thank you for the envelopes,
Mr. Carlisle.

195
00:20:05,095 --> 00:20:06,763
Choose your fate or the color
of your curtains...

196
00:20:06,847 --> 00:20:09,308
Zeena's cooking up
a good crowd out there, Pete.

197
00:20:09,391 --> 00:20:11,310
- You sauced? Come on, Pete.
- Oh...

198
00:20:11,393 --> 00:20:13,145
- Pete, Zeena's on.
- Oh?

199
00:20:13,228 --> 00:20:14,855
I'll read the first card.

200
00:20:16,773 --> 00:20:18,025
She gonna need it soon.

201
00:20:18,108 --> 00:20:19,651
Okay, Abigail.
Write it down.

202
00:20:19,735 --> 00:20:21,153
- Where's the chalk?
- Right here.

203
00:20:21,236 --> 00:20:23,864
People always ask me
if I have spirit aid.

204
00:20:23,947 --> 00:20:28,619
Well, folks, the only spirits I
control are the ones in this bottle.

205
00:20:30,579 --> 00:20:33,624
The spirits of alcohol.

206
00:20:33,707 --> 00:20:36,501
Worried about her mother.
Gonna be looking soon.

207
00:20:36,585 --> 00:20:38,045
And every card after that,
you understand?

208
00:20:38,128 --> 00:20:40,130
I know it, I know it.

209
00:20:49,139 --> 00:20:52,517
The questions are now
in the ether.

210
00:20:52,601 --> 00:20:56,063
I've never touched them.
Never read them.

211
00:20:56,146 --> 00:20:58,732
I don't need to, 'cause I get
an impression right here.

212
00:20:58,815 --> 00:21:00,108
There you go, Zeenee.

213
00:21:02,444 --> 00:21:03,528
There's a woman

214
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:05,948
worried about her mother.

215
00:21:07,157 --> 00:21:09,785
"Will mother get better?"

216
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:11,119
Pete's sauced.

217
00:21:12,788 --> 00:21:13,789
I'll go.

218
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:15,332
Wait,
I'm getting a letter.

219
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:17,668
Yes. It's an "A".

220
00:21:17,751 --> 00:21:18,835
That's me.

221
00:21:22,005 --> 00:21:24,216
Abigail?
Is that your name, dear?

222
00:21:27,594 --> 00:21:29,846
I'd say your mother
had a lot of hard work...

223
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:31,640
- Molly.
- Which envelope is it, Pete?

224
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:33,225
- It's... I don't know.
- This one?

225
00:21:34,101 --> 00:21:35,978
I can't remember.

226
00:21:36,645 --> 00:21:37,771
I'm sorry, Molly.

227
00:21:37,854 --> 00:21:39,398
Now, I will attempt
to read the next question.

228
00:21:39,481 --> 00:21:40,899
I don't know which one it is.

229
00:21:40,983 --> 00:21:42,317
Madam Zeena.

230
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:43,443
Tell me more.

231
00:21:44,361 --> 00:21:45,278
Please.

232
00:21:45,362 --> 00:21:47,781
Tell her, Madam Zeena.
If you can.

233
00:21:49,491 --> 00:21:54,913
You have a couple of brothers,
or sisters, haven't you?

234
00:21:54,997 --> 00:21:56,832
No, I don't, ma'am.

235
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:58,250
Only one sister.

236
00:21:59,543 --> 00:22:01,336
My brother passed away.

237
00:22:04,715 --> 00:22:06,008
Ah, yes.

238
00:22:07,134 --> 00:22:08,385
But I see him.

239
00:22:09,052 --> 00:22:10,012
That's what threw me.

240
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:13,557
Your brother is right here
this very minute.

241
00:22:14,725 --> 00:22:17,102
His hand is on your shoulder.

242
00:22:21,815 --> 00:22:22,983
Can you feel it?

243
00:22:25,485 --> 00:22:27,279
Yes.

244
00:22:27,362 --> 00:22:29,573
Yes, I felt
something.

245
00:22:29,656 --> 00:22:31,158
I felt his hand.

246
00:22:32,492 --> 00:22:34,327
Oh, God! Harry!

247
00:22:54,681 --> 00:22:56,683
Are you okay?

248
00:22:56,767 --> 00:22:59,644
Oh, the poor woman,
she wanted to know more.

249
00:22:59,728 --> 00:23:01,938
Of course she did.

250
00:23:02,022 --> 00:23:03,857
- What did you tell her?
- Well, the truth.

251
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:04,858
We missed a cue

252
00:23:04,941 --> 00:23:06,943
and I had to use a trick
to ease the crowd.

253
00:23:07,027 --> 00:23:08,320
It was just a trick.

254
00:23:09,237 --> 00:23:10,238
It hurt.

255
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:12,741
Well, it's good.
It's good that you did that.

256
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:16,328
Yeah, well,
I gave her an amulet.

257
00:23:16,411 --> 00:23:17,871
I'm sorry
I missed the cue.

258
00:23:17,954 --> 00:23:20,749
I don't know why you don't
keep it going for her.

259
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,126
- Never do a spook show.
- Oh.

260
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:25,045
No good comes out
of a spook show.

261
00:23:25,128 --> 00:23:27,547
Is it so bad
to give her hope?

262
00:23:27,631 --> 00:23:29,758
It ain't hope
if it's a lie, Stan.

263
00:23:32,302 --> 00:23:34,805
All right, well,
what are those cards then?

264
00:23:34,888 --> 00:23:36,181
Hmm? Tarot?

265
00:23:36,264 --> 00:23:37,724
Well, honey,
it ain't the same thing.

266
00:23:37,808 --> 00:23:41,144
No, I even run 'em over
for myself. And Pete.

267
00:23:41,228 --> 00:23:43,772
You always get
some kind of answer.

268
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:46,066
I bought those for you
in Paris.

269
00:23:48,443 --> 00:23:49,986
We stayed at the Ritz.

270
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:53,115
Ah. Held over four weeks.

271
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:55,325
Ah...

272
00:23:57,577 --> 00:24:00,997
I wrote most of
the word system on that tour.

273
00:24:01,081 --> 00:24:03,375
That's where
we perfected the act.

274
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:04,543
Didn't we, George?

275
00:24:04,626 --> 00:24:06,044
Can you still do it?

276
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:14,469
Eh...

277
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:17,430
All right.

278
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,852
Stanton...

279
00:24:21,935 --> 00:24:25,522
give Zeena an article.
Any article.

280
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:36,116
Please concentrate
on this object

281
00:24:36,199 --> 00:24:38,368
I have in my hand,
Professor.

282
00:24:43,331 --> 00:24:44,833
What can
you tell me?

283
00:24:45,834 --> 00:24:47,294
Wristwatch.

284
00:24:47,377 --> 00:24:48,378
Leather band.

285
00:24:49,171 --> 00:24:51,631
Brass, not gold.

286
00:24:53,008 --> 00:24:56,094
Oh. Old and worn down.

287
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:58,513
Ah...

288
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:00,432
But it's full of meaning...

289
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,853
Ah, it wasn't
yours originally, was it?

290
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:06,813
You took it, or...

291
00:25:08,899 --> 00:25:11,276
You stole it, didn't you?

292
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:15,155
Oh, I see an older man.

293
00:25:15,238 --> 00:25:18,450
Oh, the boy hates him.

294
00:25:18,533 --> 00:25:23,371
Oh, the boy would love to be
loved, but he hates that man...

295
00:25:29,669 --> 00:25:30,837
Death.

296
00:25:32,047 --> 00:25:34,299
Death and the wish of death.

297
00:25:39,387 --> 00:25:40,764
He loved that watch.

298
00:25:40,847 --> 00:25:42,891
That was his pride,
my father.

299
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:46,102
Was it now?

300
00:25:50,273 --> 00:25:51,358
No, no, no.

301
00:25:51,441 --> 00:25:53,068
That's it. That's it.

302
00:25:54,236 --> 00:25:55,445
That's it.

303
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:15,632
It's, uh...

304
00:26:15,715 --> 00:26:17,050
It's all there.

305
00:26:28,311 --> 00:26:29,729
Now, you see,

306
00:26:30,772 --> 00:26:32,649
each word has a number,

307
00:26:32,732 --> 00:26:35,068
and that number leads you
to a different word.

308
00:26:35,819 --> 00:26:37,237
Ba-bum!

309
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,531
Zeena feeds them to me.

310
00:26:39,614 --> 00:26:44,536
"Please concentrate on the object
I have in my hand, Professor."

311
00:26:44,619 --> 00:26:47,205
"Please",
"an object", 21.

312
00:26:47,289 --> 00:26:51,835
Emphasis on "concentrate" means
that it is old and worn down.

313
00:26:51,918 --> 00:26:53,086
Cheap.

314
00:26:53,169 --> 00:26:54,170
Ba-bum.

315
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:57,966
But...

316
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:02,554
you gotta know
how to read the mark.

317
00:27:03,596 --> 00:27:06,933
How they move
and talk, dress.

318
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:11,813
People are desperate
to tell you who they are.

319
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:13,940
Desperate to be seen.

320
00:27:14,024 --> 00:27:15,358
Ain't that the truth?

321
00:27:17,652 --> 00:27:19,779
Yeah, but how do you know
if you got 'em hooked?

322
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,157
Well, you pause.

323
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,366
That's right.

324
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:26,036
You take a moment.

325
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:32,959
"Would you excuse me, please?
I need a glass of water."

326
00:27:33,043 --> 00:27:34,836
Yeah, or you faint.

327
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:37,213
Weakened by the effort.

328
00:27:39,966 --> 00:27:41,718
How'd you know
about my father, though?

329
00:27:42,552 --> 00:27:44,596
That's a stock reading.

330
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:46,348
It's a "Black Rainbow."

331
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:48,058
One size fits all.

332
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:53,688
Thrifty but generous,
private but friendly,

333
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:55,440
and... and you,

334
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:59,694
you hated him but loved him.

335
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:02,197
Now, everybody's had
some trouble.

336
00:28:03,239 --> 00:28:05,283
Somebody they've hated.

337
00:28:07,077 --> 00:28:09,537
Shadow from their past.

338
00:28:14,376 --> 00:28:17,128
And usually for a boy,
it's the old man.

339
00:28:18,838 --> 00:28:20,465
Now, if the mark is older,

340
00:28:20,548 --> 00:28:24,761
you say you had, uh,
some present loss.

341
00:28:24,844 --> 00:28:26,179
But younger?

342
00:28:26,262 --> 00:28:27,389
It's the father.

343
00:28:28,056 --> 00:28:29,724
There's always a father.

344
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:38,024
Well,

345
00:28:39,234 --> 00:28:41,444
I will take this to Clem.

346
00:28:43,113 --> 00:28:44,906
We had a good day today.

347
00:28:46,199 --> 00:28:47,200
A great day.

348
00:28:57,627 --> 00:28:59,629
Oh, my sweet Pete.

349
00:29:01,464 --> 00:29:03,591
He breaks my heart.

350
00:29:06,594 --> 00:29:09,722
No, no, no. No more belting
the grape for you, Pete.

351
00:29:09,806 --> 00:29:10,765
I promised Zeena.

352
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:13,393
Oh, Zeena's
not gonna know, Clem.

353
00:29:13,476 --> 00:29:15,019
Just one bottle,
that's all.

354
00:29:15,103 --> 00:29:17,689
Okay. Last time.

355
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,441
Just go.

356
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:21,609
Bless you, Clem.
Bless you.

357
00:29:37,292 --> 00:29:40,003
These are my little angels.

358
00:29:40,086 --> 00:29:42,213
Set it down here.
That's his home.

359
00:29:43,089 --> 00:29:44,507
Uh, no.

360
00:29:44,591 --> 00:29:47,260
Face him the other way,
he's shy.

361
00:29:47,343 --> 00:29:50,763
Got to keep my beauties
pickled fresh.

362
00:29:50,847 --> 00:29:56,394
"Begotten by the same lust and threat
that got us all walkin' on this earth,

363
00:29:56,478 --> 00:29:59,856
"but gone wrong somehow
in the maternal womb.

364
00:29:59,939 --> 00:30:03,443
"Not fit for livin'."

365
00:30:03,526 --> 00:30:08,781
Most of 'em die right at childbirth,
or even inside the mother.

366
00:30:11,951 --> 00:30:14,829
Now, this one
is a rare one.

367
00:30:23,671 --> 00:30:25,089
Enoch.

368
00:30:26,466 --> 00:30:29,177
I named him
on account of the Bible.

369
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:32,138
Little fucker killed his
mother right at childbirth.

370
00:30:32,222 --> 00:30:36,476
Flopped around for a couple of
days, brayin' like a calf.

371
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:39,312
Eye follows you around
like 'em portraits.

372
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:44,526
Red box, wood alcohol.

373
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:46,402
Good for picklin',
bad for drinkin'.

374
00:30:46,486 --> 00:30:48,655
Poison, real poison.

375
00:30:49,989 --> 00:30:51,157
Blue box,

376
00:30:51,241 --> 00:30:53,451
sweet sugarcane,
double-cooked.

377
00:30:53,535 --> 00:30:57,956
Christ almighty, throat's sore
as a bull's ass in fly time.

378
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:02,627
Folks know
to come to me for it.

379
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:04,546
Half a plug a quart.

380
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:06,881
Never cop a quart.

381
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:11,094
You gotta make the tin cling,
same as everybody else.

382
00:31:11,177 --> 00:31:12,554
I never touch the stuff.

383
00:31:13,888 --> 00:31:15,265
Ain't we virtuous?

384
00:31:15,348 --> 00:31:16,891
Just say you understand.

385
00:31:18,226 --> 00:31:20,144
- I understand.
- What do you understand?

386
00:31:23,273 --> 00:31:24,607
Never cop a quart.

387
00:31:24,691 --> 00:31:26,442
That's right.

388
00:31:26,526 --> 00:31:28,611
Toe the line,
don't fuck with me.

389
00:31:29,445 --> 00:31:30,697
That's the lesson.

390
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:40,248
<i>Entrez.</i>

391
00:31:41,249 --> 00:31:42,875
Clem asked me
to deliver this to you.

392
00:31:42,959 --> 00:31:44,836
Six quarts of wood alcohol
for the show.

393
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:46,379
Oh, yeah,
for the show.

394
00:31:46,462 --> 00:31:48,506
That's a
pity, isn't it?

395
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:50,008
You can just
put 'em there.

396
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:54,053
Here you go.

397
00:31:55,722 --> 00:31:56,848
Hey, Pete.

398
00:31:56,931 --> 00:31:59,976
I'd love to learn anything
that you'd wanna teach me.

399
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:03,563
Teach you?

400
00:32:05,148 --> 00:32:06,858
I understand
if you don't wanna

401
00:32:06,941 --> 00:32:09,527
give away your secrets.

402
00:32:09,611 --> 00:32:13,114
Uh, no. It's not that,
my boy. It's, uh...

403
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:15,116
Well, it's just that
it's been some time

404
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:18,536
since anybody's asked me
to teach them anything.

405
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:21,581
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

406
00:32:21,664 --> 00:32:24,459
- You know where to find me.
- Yes, I do.

407
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:25,835
Have a good day.

408
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:40,475
Never court
the sins of lust or pride.

409
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:46,856
I was turned into this sorrowful
shape, for I disobeyed my parents.

410
00:32:46,939 --> 00:32:49,108
They wanted
only my well-being...

411
00:32:49,192 --> 00:32:51,778
Born during
an electrical storm,

412
00:32:51,861 --> 00:32:55,990
the atmosphere charged
with electrostatic power.

413
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:58,159
I am now able to
withstand thousands...

414
00:33:00,036 --> 00:33:02,413
...upon thousands of volts

415
00:33:02,497 --> 00:33:05,249
as they will course
through my body.

416
00:33:06,959 --> 00:33:10,088
But you must be warned
to keep your distance,

417
00:33:10,171 --> 00:33:13,675
for this entertainment carries with
it the danger of electrocution,

418
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:16,386
even for those
in close proximity.

419
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:54,966
I'm not like this.

420
00:33:55,049 --> 00:33:58,344
Not like this,
I am not like this.

421
00:34:29,125 --> 00:34:30,960
Molly.

422
00:34:31,043 --> 00:34:32,211
I wanna show you something.
You have a second?

423
00:34:32,295 --> 00:34:33,421
I just got a couple of
minutes before Zeena starts.

424
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:34,630
Mm-hmm.

425
00:34:34,714 --> 00:34:37,091
So, uh, I saw your show,
and I think it's real good,

426
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:39,302
but I got an idea
for your act.

427
00:34:39,385 --> 00:34:40,386
Now, in your show,
you just...

428
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:42,346
You know,
you tell a little story.

429
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:43,890
But what if
you showed them something?

430
00:34:43,973 --> 00:34:44,932
What do you
think of that?

431
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:47,560
An electric chair,
and they put you in it.

432
00:34:47,643 --> 00:34:48,728
Manacles in,

433
00:34:48,811 --> 00:34:50,897
and the audience is going,
"What's going on here?"

434
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,523
All of a sudden,
little guy comes shufflin' out

435
00:34:52,607 --> 00:34:54,192
with an executioner's hood.

436
00:34:54,275 --> 00:34:55,693
He pulls this lever,
and they get real scared.

437
00:34:55,777 --> 00:34:56,903
They think maybe
you're gonna die,

438
00:34:56,986 --> 00:34:58,446
and boom, you got them,
they're back on their heels.

439
00:34:58,529 --> 00:34:59,530
What do you say?

440
00:35:00,406 --> 00:35:02,200
You wanna execute me?

441
00:35:02,283 --> 00:35:03,534
Just for a second.

442
00:35:03,618 --> 00:35:04,786
Then you come back to life.

443
00:35:08,456 --> 00:35:09,624
You drew me?

444
00:35:11,167 --> 00:35:12,752
Yeah, I draw
what's on my mind.

445
00:35:15,797 --> 00:35:17,298
You could make a living
at this.

446
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:19,467
My mama used to put me in these
contests when I was a kid.

447
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:22,804
I used to win all of them,
but I don't know, I just...

448
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:25,640
Just something I've always done.
Helps me think.

449
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:28,810
You do know this is
the Ragtag Opera, right?

450
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:31,479
Nothing's really the best
of anything around here.

451
00:35:31,562 --> 00:35:32,855
Well, you're better
than this place.

452
00:35:32,939 --> 00:35:34,690
Maybe you think I'm
special, but I'm not.

453
00:35:34,774 --> 00:35:36,692
Well, maybe I see something
in you you don't see.

454
00:35:36,776 --> 00:35:38,736
- You do?
- I mean, it's possible.

455
00:35:40,154 --> 00:35:42,073
Maybe all this is
good enough for me.

456
00:35:42,156 --> 00:35:44,075
I don't believe you.

457
00:35:44,158 --> 00:35:47,203
If it's not good enough for me,
sure ain't good enough for you.

458
00:35:48,663 --> 00:35:49,622
What do you think?

459
00:35:50,164 --> 00:35:51,207
You look good.

460
00:35:51,874 --> 00:35:52,917
Think about it.

461
00:36:00,716 --> 00:36:02,176
Okay, you got steps.

462
00:36:06,889 --> 00:36:07,974
Ready?

463
00:36:08,474 --> 00:36:09,684
Voila.

464
00:36:11,394 --> 00:36:13,020
Looks just like
the sketch, don't it?

465
00:36:15,731 --> 00:36:16,816
No, sit in the chair.

466
00:36:16,899 --> 00:36:19,861
You made this?
When did you make this?

467
00:36:20,987 --> 00:36:22,363
And put your hands
in there.

468
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:23,447
- Like that?
- Yeah.

469
00:36:23,531 --> 00:36:25,032
Oh!

470
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:27,493
See that? Major.
That's drama.

471
00:36:29,328 --> 00:36:32,081
Now your job over here is
gonna pull this lever. Okay?

472
00:36:32,165 --> 00:36:33,249
Don't bend down
to talk to me.

473
00:36:33,332 --> 00:36:34,041
No, I'm not bending down.
I'm trying to show you.

474
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:36,043
You're gonna
pull this lever back.

475
00:36:37,753 --> 00:36:40,006
No, you gotta do it with some
force, with some drama.

476
00:36:40,089 --> 00:36:42,300
Put your back into it,
two hands. You got it.

477
00:36:44,218 --> 00:36:45,761
Ahh!
And the electricity is flying,

478
00:36:45,845 --> 00:36:46,971
everybody's horrified.

479
00:36:47,054 --> 00:36:48,472
Is she gonna live or die?
It's going back and forth.

480
00:36:48,556 --> 00:36:49,765
And then you're gonna
save the day,

481
00:36:49,849 --> 00:36:51,225
and you're gonna push it
forward, two hands.

482
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:53,102
Really put some...
And that's it!

483
00:36:53,185 --> 00:36:55,313
Manacles come off,
smoke's coming out.

484
00:36:55,396 --> 00:36:56,314
I haven't rigged this yet,

485
00:36:56,397 --> 00:36:57,315
but these two areas
are gonna have sparks.

486
00:36:57,398 --> 00:36:59,400
I don't know about
all your gobbledygook,

487
00:36:59,483 --> 00:37:01,068
but I am not wearing this,
I tell you that.

488
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:02,403
Oh, but it's so good.

489
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:04,280
What are you all of a
sudden, an engineer?

490
00:37:04,363 --> 00:37:06,657
It's the same rubber mat as
before, same electrical current.

491
00:37:06,741 --> 00:37:08,451
Just a better show,
that's all.

492
00:37:08,534 --> 00:37:09,702
What does
this wheel thing do?

493
00:37:09,785 --> 00:37:10,953
That's bullshit.

494
00:37:12,914 --> 00:37:13,873
Tell you what.

495
00:37:15,082 --> 00:37:17,209
- I'll think about it.
- I'll do it.

496
00:37:17,293 --> 00:37:19,211
I think he's
onto something.

497
00:37:19,587 --> 00:37:20,588
Sure.

498
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:30,556
You going someplace special?

499
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,059
Just driving Pete and Zeena
into town.

500
00:37:33,142 --> 00:37:34,560
You want us to pick up
something for you?

501
00:37:34,644 --> 00:37:36,062
Nah, I'm good.

502
00:37:40,399 --> 00:37:42,109
- What's it to you?
- Nothin'.

503
00:37:44,528 --> 00:37:48,240
You been bumpin' gums
with Molly a little too often.

504
00:37:48,324 --> 00:37:50,368
Just so happens
I knew her old man.

505
00:37:50,451 --> 00:37:52,286
I knew him really good.

506
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:54,747
Old-time grifter.

507
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:57,875
My guess, he wouldn't
have liked you at all.

508
00:37:57,959 --> 00:38:01,837
I promised him I'd take care of the
girl, and I'm gonna.

509
00:38:01,921 --> 00:38:04,966
I still got five good pounds
of meat and bone right here.

510
00:38:06,467 --> 00:38:08,844
Hurt that girl,
you get 'em all.

511
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:33,160
What are you
still doing up out here?

512
00:38:34,704 --> 00:38:36,956
I had a dream.
I couldn't go back to sleep.

513
00:38:40,835 --> 00:38:42,044
Wanna tell me about it?

514
00:38:43,796 --> 00:38:45,131
It was about my dad.

515
00:38:48,009 --> 00:38:49,135
Did he pass?

516
00:38:51,595 --> 00:38:54,265
He was alive and smiling
in the dream.

517
00:38:54,348 --> 00:38:56,225
I'll bet you he was
handsome, wasn't he?

518
00:38:56,308 --> 00:38:58,394
Girls always
take after their daddies.

519
00:38:58,477 --> 00:38:59,854
Hmm.

520
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:02,982
"Mary Margaret Cahill,
don't forget to smile," he said.

521
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:07,445
I don't really like to smile,
but I'd sure as hell smile for him.

522
00:39:08,738 --> 00:39:10,740
He could charm his way
out of anything.

523
00:39:10,823 --> 00:39:12,658
A man after my own heart.

524
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:15,578
- Tell me more.
- About him?

525
00:39:16,495 --> 00:39:17,830
Sure, about you.

526
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,083
What about me?

527
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:32,136
I know that, uh,
you like chocolates,

528
00:39:33,054 --> 00:39:35,056
and you like to read.

529
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:37,183
And dancing.

530
00:39:37,266 --> 00:39:38,809
When was the last time
you did?

531
00:39:38,893 --> 00:39:40,519
- A while.
- Yeah?

532
00:39:44,899 --> 00:39:46,192
We gonna fix that.

533
00:39:50,029 --> 00:39:51,280
You ready?

534
00:39:51,363 --> 00:39:52,823
Giddy up.

535
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:13,594
I've been thinking
about what you said, Stan.

536
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:15,179
What did I say?

537
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,848
I remember.

538
00:40:19,308 --> 00:40:20,643
And where would we go?

539
00:40:25,731 --> 00:40:28,984
What if I told you I can get my
hands on a two person act for us?

540
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:32,488
What are you
talking about?

541
00:40:32,571 --> 00:40:35,741
I'm talking about an act
that would get us headlining

542
00:40:35,825 --> 00:40:37,701
in the biggest hotels
and showrooms

543
00:40:37,785 --> 00:40:39,578
from the East Coast
to the West Coast.

544
00:40:39,662 --> 00:40:40,621
You're dreaming.

545
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:43,749
No, Molly.
You're bigger than this place.

546
00:40:43,833 --> 00:40:46,627
If you let me, I wanna give you
the world and everything in it.

547
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:57,471
Molly.

548
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:35,926
Come on.
I need a hand.

549
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:39,013
Wound on his head
went bad.

550
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:40,598
Flies got to it.

551
00:41:41,724 --> 00:41:44,059
Fever won't come down.

552
00:41:44,143 --> 00:41:47,396
- Is he dead?
- No. But he's bound to be.

553
00:41:56,071 --> 00:41:57,156
You heard?

554
00:41:57,239 --> 00:41:59,408
That little Kraut, the one
that looks like Chaplin,

555
00:41:59,491 --> 00:42:00,826
he just invaded Poland!

556
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:02,786
The balls on him.
Put him here.

557
00:42:09,251 --> 00:42:11,712
- Come on!
- You gonna wait?

558
00:42:11,795 --> 00:42:13,214
And answer questions? No!

559
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:15,257
They'll take him,
they'll care for him.

560
00:42:15,341 --> 00:42:17,718
- Put him under the...
- I said leave him be!

561
00:42:17,801 --> 00:42:19,261
Can't leave him in the rain.

562
00:42:19,345 --> 00:42:22,139
Don't pretend
you give a shit with me.

563
00:42:22,223 --> 00:42:24,183
You hungry?
I'm starving!

564
00:42:24,266 --> 00:42:26,685
Come on! Steak and eggs, on me.

565
00:42:33,776 --> 00:42:36,237
Sweetie, uh,
salt and pepper, please.

566
00:42:39,281 --> 00:42:41,200
How do you ever
get a guy to geek?

567
00:42:44,245 --> 00:42:47,289
Oh, I ain't gonna crap you up.
It ain't easy.

568
00:42:47,373 --> 00:42:49,667
You gotta pick up
a broken drunk.

569
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:52,461
A real alkie,
a two bottle-a-day fool, see?

570
00:42:52,544 --> 00:42:53,754
Pick him up from where?

571
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:56,882
Nightmare alleys, train tracks,
flophouses, you name it.

572
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:04,223
Lot of folks came back from the war
addicted to the poppy, to booze.

573
00:43:04,306 --> 00:43:09,353
Now, opium really sinks its claws,
but you reel 'em in with booze.

574
00:43:11,105 --> 00:43:12,982
You tell 'em,

575
00:43:13,065 --> 00:43:16,068
"I got a little job for you.
It's a temporary job."

576
00:43:16,151 --> 00:43:17,987
Make sure you
emphasize that.

577
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:21,907
"Just temporary, until we
get ourselves another geek."

578
00:43:28,289 --> 00:43:31,250
You spike it with
that opium tincture.

579
00:43:31,333 --> 00:43:33,544
One drop per bottle,
that's all.

580
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:35,337
But, oh...

581
00:43:35,421 --> 00:43:39,049
oh, now, this is what
he thinks is heaven.

582
00:43:39,133 --> 00:43:42,177
So, you say to him like this,
you say to him,

583
00:43:42,261 --> 00:43:45,389
"Well, I gotta get me
a real geek."

584
00:43:45,472 --> 00:43:47,808
He says,
"Ain't I doing okay?"

585
00:43:47,891 --> 00:43:50,102
You say, "Like crap
you're doing okay.

586
00:43:50,185 --> 00:43:52,688
"You can't draw a real
crowd faking a geek.

587
00:43:52,771 --> 00:43:53,772
"You're through."

588
00:43:53,856 --> 00:43:55,065
And you walk off.

589
00:44:00,779 --> 00:44:02,698
Now, that night,

590
00:44:02,781 --> 00:44:06,994
you drag out the lecture,
you lay it on thick.

591
00:44:07,077 --> 00:44:11,165
All the while you're talking,
he's thinking about sobering up,

592
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:15,002
getting the crawling shakes,
the screaming, the terrors.

593
00:44:16,879 --> 00:44:20,049
You give him time to think
that over while you're talking.

594
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:25,095
Then, you throw him
the chicken.

595
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:27,097
He'll geek.

596
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:28,432
Jesus.

597
00:44:30,476 --> 00:44:31,560
Poor soul.

598
00:44:37,191 --> 00:44:38,192
Like this.

599
00:44:39,068 --> 00:44:41,028
Index, middle finger,

600
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:44,239
half bent,
parallel to your thumb.

601
00:44:44,323 --> 00:44:47,868
As if you're going to pluck
something out of the air.

602
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:49,620
Left hand on your temple.

603
00:44:49,703 --> 00:44:53,749
This means you're asking
for color, texture, specifics.

604
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:56,919
That's it.

605
00:44:57,002 --> 00:44:58,962
You got
quite a gift.

606
00:44:59,046 --> 00:45:01,131
I don't know
how you do it, Pete.

607
00:45:01,215 --> 00:45:02,466
Keep all that
in your head,

608
00:45:02,549 --> 00:45:05,135
at the same time
entertaining all these folks.

609
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:12,476
You know, if, um...

610
00:45:18,065 --> 00:45:20,150
If you're good
at reading people,

611
00:45:20,234 --> 00:45:23,445
it's mostly because
you learned as a child,

612
00:45:23,529 --> 00:45:27,324
trying to stay one step ahead
of whatever tormented you.

613
00:45:29,785 --> 00:45:33,831
Now, if they really did
a number on you,

614
00:45:33,914 --> 00:45:36,583
then that crack,
it's a hollow.

615
00:45:37,543 --> 00:45:39,753
And there'll
never be enough.

616
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:41,964
There's no
filling that in.

617
00:45:47,469 --> 00:45:49,263
Uh...

618
00:45:49,346 --> 00:45:52,474
Clem is breaking in
a new geek.

619
00:45:52,558 --> 00:45:54,226
Holding out on him.

620
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:56,270
Poor bastard.

621
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:59,148
He's gotta be
half out of his mind by now.

622
00:46:03,902 --> 00:46:07,197
I think George and I
will sleep below tonight.

623
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:12,494
Stan, my boy.

624
00:46:12,578 --> 00:46:14,955
Would you be
so kind as to...

625
00:46:15,038 --> 00:46:18,459
as to procure me
a pint of the sugarcane?

626
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:22,463
Pete, close your eyes
and go to bed.

627
00:46:22,546 --> 00:46:24,506
I need an incentive, son.

628
00:46:26,925 --> 00:46:27,926
Hmm.

629
00:46:31,597 --> 00:46:32,931
I'll see what I can do.

630
00:46:33,015 --> 00:46:34,224
Attaboy.

631
00:47:02,544 --> 00:47:03,837
Jesus.

632
00:47:04,505 --> 00:47:06,381
You got no rhythm.

633
00:47:52,177 --> 00:47:53,929
- What are you doing?
- Uh...

634
00:47:54,012 --> 00:47:56,473
I didn't mean any harm by it,
Pete. I was just curious.

635
00:47:58,433 --> 00:48:01,895
Stan, this book,
it can be misused.

636
00:48:01,979 --> 00:48:03,897
Do you understand?

637
00:48:03,981 --> 00:48:07,109
It's why I stopped
doing the act.

638
00:48:08,151 --> 00:48:10,779
I got shuteye.

639
00:48:10,862 --> 00:48:16,535
When a man believes his own lies,
starts believing that he has the power,

640
00:48:17,494 --> 00:48:19,871
he's got shuteye.

641
00:48:19,955 --> 00:48:22,165
Because now he believes
it's all true.

642
00:48:23,917 --> 00:48:28,213
And people get hurt.
Good, God-fearing people.

643
00:48:28,964 --> 00:48:32,884
And then you lie.
You lie.

644
00:48:32,968 --> 00:48:37,055
And when the lies end,
there it is.

645
00:48:37,139 --> 00:48:40,267
The face of God,
staring at you straight.

646
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:42,102
No matter where you turn.

647
00:48:44,229 --> 00:48:47,190
No man can
outrun God, Stan.

648
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:51,737
Yes, sir.

649
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:17,054
Middle and index finger bent,

650
00:49:17,137 --> 00:49:19,681
parallel to the thumb.

651
00:49:19,765 --> 00:49:22,768
Raise your left hand to your temple,
middle and index finger bent.

652
00:49:22,851 --> 00:49:24,811
Parallel to your thumb.

653
00:49:24,895 --> 00:49:26,730
Raise your hand
to your temple.

654
00:49:28,273 --> 00:49:30,150
Asking for
something specific.

655
00:49:53,632 --> 00:49:57,636
No! No! Where is he?
Where is he?

656
00:49:57,719 --> 00:49:59,137
Pete! Come on!

657
00:49:59,221 --> 00:50:00,305
Zeena!

658
00:50:00,389 --> 00:50:02,015
Hey, Clem, we got a problem!

659
00:50:16,655 --> 00:50:19,616
It's Pete. He finally
did it to himself.

660
00:50:20,158 --> 00:50:21,535
He ain't moving.

661
00:50:25,622 --> 00:50:28,375
Pete. Oh, my... Pete.

662
00:50:37,634 --> 00:50:39,010
Pete!

663
00:50:42,389 --> 00:50:45,559
Pete! Pete!

664
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:55,444
Sin and salvation.
Heaven and Hell.

665
00:50:55,527 --> 00:50:58,530
Find out what it feels like
right here on Earth.

666
00:50:58,613 --> 00:51:03,410
Let the mirrors show you who
you are and who you shall be.

667
00:51:03,493 --> 00:51:05,328
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

668
00:51:12,169 --> 00:51:14,171
<i>Spine-chilling rides!</i>

669
00:51:14,254 --> 00:51:16,089
<i>Fun for all ages!</i>

670
00:51:18,049 --> 00:51:21,344
<i>The sensation of the century!</i>

671
00:51:23,722 --> 00:51:27,601
<i>Ten attractions
for a single ticket.</i>

672
00:51:39,988 --> 00:51:41,740
<i>Hurry, hurry, hurry.</i>

673
00:51:41,823 --> 00:51:44,075
<i>Step right up and get a prize.</i>

674
00:51:47,954 --> 00:51:48,914
- Clem!
- Yeah.

675
00:51:48,997 --> 00:51:50,081
- Clem!
- Yeah.

676
00:51:50,165 --> 00:51:52,542
Shooflies. I saw four cop cars
coming up the South.

677
00:51:52,626 --> 00:51:53,835
Oh, shit.

678
00:51:53,919 --> 00:51:56,046
They see the geek,
we're all wet.

679
00:51:56,922 --> 00:51:58,173
I'll stash him.

680
00:51:58,256 --> 00:52:00,550
You drop the banner,
chisel them a bit,

681
00:52:00,634 --> 00:52:02,135
buy me some time.

682
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:03,512
Round up all the carnies

683
00:52:03,595 --> 00:52:05,931
and take them over
to that stage over there.

684
00:52:06,014 --> 00:52:07,724
Whoopsie daisy.

685
00:52:10,018 --> 00:52:12,771
Move it, move them! Move them!

686
00:52:12,854 --> 00:52:14,481
Officer, what seems
to be happening?

687
00:52:14,564 --> 00:52:15,732
Join the others.

688
00:52:15,816 --> 00:52:17,692
Is that a warrant?
What's that for?

689
00:52:17,776 --> 00:52:19,694
Don't try to
pull that legal stuff.

690
00:52:19,778 --> 00:52:22,280
We're gonna close this whole
joint down one way or another.

691
00:52:22,364 --> 00:52:23,281
Yes, sir.

692
00:52:23,365 --> 00:52:25,575
...that you
are carrying around...

693
00:52:25,659 --> 00:52:27,577
...an illegal performance

694
00:52:27,661 --> 00:52:31,122
emphasizing cruelty
to both animal and man.

695
00:52:31,206 --> 00:52:33,291
And you, young lady.

696
00:52:33,375 --> 00:52:36,336
We have got wives
and daughters in this town.

697
00:52:36,419 --> 00:52:39,923
You are under arrest for indecency.
Get her down!

698
00:52:40,006 --> 00:52:43,593
No, stop! Stop!
Get down off there!

699
00:52:43,677 --> 00:52:45,095
- I'll club you down.
- The wheel is turning.

700
00:52:45,178 --> 00:52:46,805
The electrical current's
gotta go somewhere.

701
00:52:46,888 --> 00:52:48,598
Major, please!

702
00:52:48,682 --> 00:52:50,976
If you just permit us, sir,
you can judge in a fair manner

703
00:52:51,059 --> 00:52:52,269
like the good King Solomon.

704
00:52:52,352 --> 00:52:53,478
Everybody, back off!

705
00:53:02,529 --> 00:53:04,865
That's why she's forced to wear
the brief as a covering, sir.

706
00:53:04,948 --> 00:53:06,199
She purges the current.

707
00:53:06,533 --> 00:53:07,534
Molly?

708
00:53:08,326 --> 00:53:09,619
Molly? You okay?

709
00:53:14,124 --> 00:53:15,500
Make way.

710
00:53:15,584 --> 00:53:17,294
She just saved
your deputies' lives.

711
00:53:17,377 --> 00:53:18,628
Molly, Molly.

712
00:53:18,712 --> 00:53:21,172
I am closing you down.

713
00:53:21,256 --> 00:53:23,258
I ain't none of
your thieving southern police

714
00:53:23,341 --> 00:53:27,888
kissing a priest's toe on Sundays
and raking in graft six days a week.

715
00:53:28,638 --> 00:53:30,181
Is your name Jeremiah?

716
00:53:30,265 --> 00:53:33,018
Jeremiah, Jeremiah...
J... Jer... J... J...

717
00:53:33,768 --> 00:53:35,270
Jedediah Judd.

718
00:53:37,063 --> 00:53:38,273
Yeah.

719
00:53:42,152 --> 00:53:44,070
A matter of the utmost
importance has arisen, sir.

720
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:46,615
If I could just have
a minute of your time.

721
00:53:46,698 --> 00:53:48,283
A message has come through.

722
00:53:48,366 --> 00:53:51,953
And I think you're gonna wanna hear it,
but not in front of these kind folks.

723
00:53:52,037 --> 00:53:53,121
Please, sir.

724
00:53:58,293 --> 00:53:59,294
Nobody leaves.

725
00:53:59,377 --> 00:54:02,380
Thank you.
Thank you.

726
00:54:02,464 --> 00:54:05,550
My name is Stanton Carlisle,
Marshal Judd, and my family's Scot.

727
00:54:05,634 --> 00:54:08,428
Scots are gifted with what the old
folks used to call "second sight."

728
00:54:08,511 --> 00:54:09,888
Now, it's clear to me,
for example,

729
00:54:09,971 --> 00:54:11,806
that you are a man
who is generally distrustful,

730
00:54:11,890 --> 00:54:13,767
but also fiercely loyal.

731
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:15,518
I'd say that's a
fair description.

732
00:54:15,602 --> 00:54:16,937
And, uh, this is
none of my business

733
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:19,564
because I know that you are capable
of handling your own affairs

734
00:54:19,648 --> 00:54:24,152
and anything else liable to come
along, but I do sense a childhood

735
00:54:24,736 --> 00:54:25,946
marred in disease.

736
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:27,822
And it makes you, uh,

737
00:54:27,906 --> 00:54:30,951
feel hemmed in by it,
trapped, even to this day.

738
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:33,828
And I sense a curio
of some kind.

739
00:54:33,912 --> 00:54:35,038
An amulet, a memento.

740
00:54:35,121 --> 00:54:37,165
You carry it on your person,
you had it for a long time.

741
00:54:37,248 --> 00:54:38,375
Who's Mary?

742
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:41,461
A saintly woman.

743
00:54:44,839 --> 00:54:45,966
My... My mother.

744
00:54:46,049 --> 00:54:47,342
May I see it?

745
00:54:48,259 --> 00:54:50,178
May I see it, sir?

746
00:54:56,518 --> 00:54:57,560
Yes.

747
00:54:59,354 --> 00:55:00,522
She wants you to know

748
00:55:00,605 --> 00:55:02,857
that your ailment has not
shunned you from greatness,

749
00:55:02,941 --> 00:55:04,192
quite the contrary.

750
00:55:04,275 --> 00:55:07,654
Your community loves you and
feels protected by you, sir.

751
00:55:07,737 --> 00:55:09,614
And yes, you couldn't serve
your country on foreign soil,

752
00:55:09,698 --> 00:55:11,574
but you protect us
here at home.

753
00:55:12,993 --> 00:55:14,995
And this medal,

754
00:55:15,078 --> 00:55:17,956
this medal should be a
reminder of her love for you.

755
00:55:18,039 --> 00:55:19,332
And as long as
you just keep it here,

756
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:22,043
close to your heart,
where our Lord Jesus Christ resides,

757
00:55:22,127 --> 00:55:24,963
it's gonna protect you
in the future.

758
00:55:25,046 --> 00:55:28,258
And she wants you
to know this, sir.

759
00:55:28,341 --> 00:55:32,846
It's only by being merciful to
others that a man has true power.

760
00:55:41,062 --> 00:55:42,647
But once I copped the
warrant off that deputy,

761
00:55:42,731 --> 00:55:44,065
I saw the marshal's name.

762
00:55:44,149 --> 00:55:45,984
I knew it was
a lead-pipe cinch.

763
00:55:48,737 --> 00:55:50,655
You know what's funny?
Pete used to always say,

764
00:55:50,739 --> 00:55:51,781
"It's not the clothes,
but the shoes

765
00:55:51,865 --> 00:55:53,199
"that could tell you
everything you need to know

766
00:55:53,283 --> 00:55:54,576
- "about a man."
- Right.

767
00:55:54,659 --> 00:55:57,412
And he had a lift
in his right shoe.

768
00:55:57,495 --> 00:55:59,873
And I bet you he had polio
or something as a kid.

769
00:55:59,956 --> 00:56:01,708
You know, the military never
letting him in, mama's boy.

770
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:02,917
I could tell by
the look in his eyes.

771
00:56:03,001 --> 00:56:04,002
That's good.

772
00:56:04,085 --> 00:56:05,045
Well, it takes one
to know one.

773
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:07,255
He tried to railroad us, Clem,

774
00:56:07,338 --> 00:56:09,090
with that
fancy moustache.

775
00:56:09,174 --> 00:56:11,051
I saw that chain
around his neck,

776
00:56:11,134 --> 00:56:12,969
I got it out of him,
Saint Christopher medal,

777
00:56:13,053 --> 00:56:14,971
all that Bible talk.

778
00:56:15,055 --> 00:56:17,098
I thought, well,
he must know somebody named Mary.

779
00:56:17,182 --> 00:56:18,975
Right.

780
00:56:19,059 --> 00:56:21,603
And lo and behold,
the Lord blessed us.

781
00:56:21,686 --> 00:56:23,188
His mother's
name's Mary.

782
00:56:23,271 --> 00:56:24,647
You had him!

783
00:56:29,527 --> 00:56:31,488
Molly,
I was looking for you.

784
00:56:31,571 --> 00:56:33,156
You all right?

785
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:37,202
I'm ready, Stan.

786
00:56:37,994 --> 00:56:39,370
Ready for what?

787
00:56:39,454 --> 00:56:41,915
To leave all this behind,
go with you.

788
00:56:44,834 --> 00:56:46,586
We are ready, aren't we?

789
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:48,213
- You saw me out there.
- I sure did.

790
00:56:48,296 --> 00:56:49,547
My whole life I've been
looking for something,

791
00:56:49,631 --> 00:56:51,007
something that I'm good at.
And I think I found it, Molly.

792
00:56:51,091 --> 00:56:52,092
I think I'm ready.

793
00:56:52,175 --> 00:56:54,469
I know you are, Stan.

794
00:56:54,552 --> 00:56:57,347
Hmm.

795
00:56:57,430 --> 00:56:59,724
And I know you'll always
look after me, right?

796
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:02,393
I will if you let me.

797
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:05,355
What about Zeena?

798
00:57:06,773 --> 00:57:08,358
Because of Pete?

799
00:57:08,441 --> 00:57:10,944
- Well, I don't wanna hurt her.
- Oh, you won't.

800
00:57:11,027 --> 00:57:15,073
Zeena's lived. She's, uh...
She knows what's what.

801
00:57:15,156 --> 00:57:17,826
Everybody knows you're the one
I've been pining after.

802
00:57:17,909 --> 00:57:20,328
Molly, you're the reason
I've stuck around.

803
00:57:33,883 --> 00:57:35,009
You seen Molly?

804
00:57:37,470 --> 00:57:38,471
Hmm?

805
00:57:40,181 --> 00:57:41,182
Stan?

806
00:57:41,975 --> 00:57:43,518
Stan?

807
00:57:43,601 --> 00:57:46,479
I never let any man do it
to me all the way before.

808
00:57:48,481 --> 00:57:50,817
None who
I agreed to, anyway.

809
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:53,194
You got nothing to worry about
with me, rabbit.

810
00:57:58,032 --> 00:57:59,409
Hey. Let's go.
Get your stuff.

811
00:57:59,492 --> 00:58:00,577
Hey!

812
00:58:01,452 --> 00:58:02,954
Bruno!

813
00:58:03,037 --> 00:58:04,414
Molly! No.
Come with me.

814
00:58:04,497 --> 00:58:05,540
Leave him alone!

815
00:58:05,623 --> 00:58:07,041
You goddamn crumb.

816
00:58:07,125 --> 00:58:09,252
No! Let go!

817
00:58:09,335 --> 00:58:11,462
I warned you, didn't I?

818
00:58:11,546 --> 00:58:13,590
- Bruno, you're gonna kill him!
- Come here!

819
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:16,426
Stop it! Let him go!

820
00:58:16,509 --> 00:58:18,219
- I'm gonna kill him!
- Leave him alone.

821
00:58:18,303 --> 00:58:20,305
Get away! I love him!
I'm leaving!

822
00:58:20,388 --> 00:58:23,600
Don't you understand?
I'm leaving with him!

823
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:07,894
You want the book back?

824
00:59:11,397 --> 00:59:12,440
No.

825
00:59:14,359 --> 00:59:15,360
Mm-mmm.

826
00:59:17,237 --> 00:59:18,696
You earned it.

827
00:59:19,822 --> 00:59:21,407
You worked hard for it.

828
00:59:41,302 --> 00:59:42,720
You ready?

829
00:59:42,804 --> 00:59:43,888
Ready for what?

830
00:59:43,972 --> 00:59:46,557
The world and everything
in it, rabbit.

831
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:12,542
One, "will."
Four, "tell."

832
01:00:12,625 --> 01:00:15,086
"Will you tell this lady
what she's thinking about?"

833
01:00:16,838 --> 01:00:18,881
Eight, "trust."

834
01:00:18,965 --> 01:00:20,633
"Do not trust
anyone involved."

835
01:00:21,676 --> 01:00:23,594
Nine, "lost."

836
01:00:23,678 --> 01:00:27,140
Nine, "complete,"
the loss of everything.

837
01:00:31,853 --> 01:00:33,980
Seven, "loneliness."

838
01:00:35,356 --> 01:00:39,485
Four, "tell."
Nine, "complete."

839
01:00:39,569 --> 01:00:42,613
"I want to tell you
about absolute loneliness."

840
01:00:43,948 --> 01:00:45,783
Eight, "trust."

841
01:00:45,867 --> 01:00:48,119
Six, "negative."

842
01:00:54,959 --> 01:00:56,627
Father.

843
01:00:56,711 --> 01:00:58,004
You're going now.

844
01:00:58,796 --> 01:01:00,048
I need you...

845
01:01:10,975 --> 01:01:12,518
Stan, are you okay?

846
01:01:13,853 --> 01:01:16,564
Yeah. Keep going.
We got two shows tomorrow.

847
01:01:19,609 --> 01:01:21,027
"Loneliness."

848
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:23,404
Two, "fear."

849
01:01:23,488 --> 01:01:25,406
"Emphasis on detail."

850
01:01:25,490 --> 01:01:28,868
Circle.
"A prophecy fulfilled."

851
01:01:32,914 --> 01:01:33,873
Wait.

852
01:01:36,376 --> 01:01:37,543
A woman.

853
01:01:38,753 --> 01:01:40,671
Can you
be more specific?

854
01:01:41,589 --> 01:01:44,008
Initials "R" or "S."

855
01:01:44,092 --> 01:01:45,468
"R."

856
01:01:47,261 --> 01:01:48,429
Yes.

857
01:01:49,514 --> 01:01:50,848
Yes, "R."

858
01:01:55,061 --> 01:01:57,814
I believe you know to whom
I'm speaking now, do you not?

859
01:01:57,897 --> 01:01:59,023
You're correct again.

860
01:02:09,033 --> 01:02:10,243
You messed up.

861
01:02:13,788 --> 01:02:14,872
Stan.

862
01:02:27,802 --> 01:02:29,262
Stan.

863
01:02:29,345 --> 01:02:31,472
<i>Next show's in 30 minutes.
Thanks, everyone.</i>

864
01:02:31,556 --> 01:02:33,307
All we do is rehearse it,
and you still fluff it.

865
01:02:33,391 --> 01:02:35,226
Out there by myself.
What happened?

866
01:02:35,309 --> 01:02:37,019
I'm sorry.
I guess I was tired.

867
01:02:37,103 --> 01:02:39,230
Let's see how many people
stay for the second show.

868
01:02:49,532 --> 01:02:50,867
A pocket watch.

869
01:02:51,826 --> 01:02:52,952
Gold.

870
01:02:53,995 --> 01:02:55,121
Concentrate.

871
01:02:55,204 --> 01:02:57,707
Do any other details
come to you?

872
01:02:57,790 --> 01:02:59,500
There is an inscription.

873
01:03:00,585 --> 01:03:01,961
Letters, am I correct?

874
01:03:02,503 --> 01:03:03,546
You are.

875
01:03:07,341 --> 01:03:08,342
Master Stanton,

876
01:03:08,426 --> 01:03:10,052
- can you kindly name them...
- May I?

877
01:03:11,304 --> 01:03:12,555
Yes, please
give me the object.

878
01:03:12,638 --> 01:03:15,016
No, thank you.
I'll hold it.

879
01:03:15,099 --> 01:03:17,310
Very well.

880
01:03:17,393 --> 01:03:21,397
Master Stanton, what is the
object being held by this lady?

881
01:03:25,902 --> 01:03:27,570
Well, it seems
it's a night of gold.

882
01:03:27,653 --> 01:03:29,405
A golden handbag.

883
01:03:31,616 --> 01:03:32,909
Be quiet, child.

884
01:03:33,951 --> 01:03:35,953
Let me ask the questions.

885
01:03:37,830 --> 01:03:40,166
What is inside the bag?

886
01:03:43,753 --> 01:03:44,837
Madam.

887
01:03:45,963 --> 01:03:47,507
What is the meaning
of this?

888
01:03:47,590 --> 01:03:52,845
You say you're genuine and I say you use
verbal signals of some sort to communicate

889
01:03:52,929 --> 01:03:54,555
between the two of you.

890
01:03:58,184 --> 01:04:00,228
There are no
tricks involved, madam.

891
01:04:00,311 --> 01:04:02,688
There's no
deception whatsoever.

892
01:04:02,772 --> 01:04:04,315
Then answer me.

893
01:04:04,398 --> 01:04:06,609
What is inside the bag?

894
01:04:07,485 --> 01:04:09,779
The usual's inside that bag.

895
01:04:09,862 --> 01:04:12,323
Lipstick, a handkerchief.

896
01:04:12,406 --> 01:04:14,242
Oh, well, that is easy
enough, is it not?

897
01:04:18,955 --> 01:04:22,041
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have never met this

898
01:04:22,667 --> 01:04:25,169
woman before.

899
01:04:25,253 --> 01:04:31,384
Nor have I any prior knowledge to the
contents of that purse, and yet...

900
01:04:31,467 --> 01:04:35,179
yet, there is something
very interesting in there.

901
01:04:38,432 --> 01:04:39,767
A small pistol.

902
01:04:41,519 --> 01:04:43,646
Nickel plated,
ivory handle.

903
01:04:45,815 --> 01:04:47,108
May I?

904
01:05:08,671 --> 01:05:11,591
You claim to carry it to

905
01:05:11,674 --> 01:05:14,760
defend yourself, but...

906
01:05:14,844 --> 01:05:17,555
I think you do it
because you like it.

907
01:05:17,638 --> 01:05:22,059
I think you do it because
it makes you feel powerful.

908
01:05:23,936 --> 01:05:25,438
Well, madam,

909
01:05:26,522 --> 01:05:28,107
you are not powerful.

910
01:05:30,234 --> 01:05:31,652
Not powerful enough.

911
01:05:39,201 --> 01:05:40,745
You are an only child,
are you not?

912
01:05:40,828 --> 01:05:42,997
Your mother died
when you were young?

913
01:05:44,790 --> 01:05:47,668
Her shadow looms large and
close, too close for comfort.

914
01:05:47,752 --> 01:05:48,836
Hardly a day went by

915
01:05:48,919 --> 01:05:52,757
in which she didn't
crush you down in small ways.

916
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:58,304
And that gun,
that gun in your purse, well,

917
01:05:58,387 --> 01:06:01,641
sometimes you have dark thoughts
about yourself, don't you?

918
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:09,065
Well,
don't you?

919
01:06:17,073 --> 01:06:18,866
Are your initials "CK"?

920
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:20,826
Yes.

921
01:06:20,910 --> 01:06:23,162
Have you suffered a loss?
A dear one, not long ago?

922
01:06:23,245 --> 01:06:25,039
Oh, God. Julian?

923
01:06:25,122 --> 01:06:27,708
Go on.

924
01:06:27,792 --> 01:06:28,793
He's...

925
01:06:28,876 --> 01:06:30,252
He's right beside you.

926
01:06:32,254 --> 01:06:33,881
His hand is resting
on your right shoulder.

927
01:06:33,964 --> 01:06:35,675
Can you feel it?

928
01:06:35,758 --> 01:06:38,052
Yes. He wants you
to know something.

929
01:06:38,135 --> 01:06:43,766
He wants you to know how
proud he is of you. And how...

930
01:07:06,414 --> 01:07:07,581
What was that about?

931
01:07:07,665 --> 01:07:08,958
I do not know.

932
01:07:09,041 --> 01:07:10,292
That was something else.

933
01:07:10,376 --> 01:07:11,877
See the way
that woman came after me?

934
01:07:11,961 --> 01:07:14,422
I saw the way you went
after her and then the man.

935
01:07:14,505 --> 01:07:16,549
What are you talking about?

936
01:07:16,632 --> 01:07:18,926
We were behind the eight.
I got us out.

937
01:07:19,009 --> 01:07:20,678
And why did you
keep on her, then?

938
01:07:20,761 --> 01:07:23,139
Well, I had to.
Crowd would've turned on us.

939
01:07:23,222 --> 01:07:25,850
Once she came after me,
I had to take her down.

940
01:07:25,933 --> 01:07:27,268
Why are you so concerned?

941
01:07:27,351 --> 01:07:29,311
I gave you the initials
of that watch

942
01:07:29,395 --> 01:07:32,022
and you turned it
into a goddamn spook show.

943
01:07:32,106 --> 01:07:34,567
Molly, did you see
the same show that I did?

944
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:35,693
That crowd was
on its feet.

945
01:07:35,776 --> 01:07:37,153
When was the last time
that happened?

946
01:07:37,236 --> 01:07:38,779
I mean, we give them mentalism
and they treat it

947
01:07:38,863 --> 01:07:42,533
like it's a dog walking on its hind
legs, but that, that was different.

948
01:07:42,616 --> 01:07:44,785
We should leave that
in the show.

949
01:07:44,869 --> 01:07:47,913
Stan, that woman was sitting at the
same table as that poor, old man

950
01:07:47,997 --> 01:07:49,498
and I've seen
her here before.

951
01:07:49,582 --> 01:07:50,416
When?

952
01:07:51,876 --> 01:07:53,043
Hey, hepcat.

953
01:07:53,127 --> 01:07:55,129
You have a request.
An after show meet.

954
01:07:55,212 --> 01:07:56,297
Uh, thank you.

955
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:58,048
- It's them.
- Oh, how do you know?

956
01:07:58,132 --> 01:08:00,009
Of course it's them.

957
01:08:00,092 --> 01:08:01,469
Then I won't see them.

958
01:08:01,552 --> 01:08:02,636
Oh, yes, you will.

959
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:05,681
You're gonna go see that
poor, old man you spooked.

960
01:08:05,765 --> 01:08:08,058
Let him off the hook.
Tell him the truth.

961
01:08:10,311 --> 01:08:11,687
All right. Truth.

962
01:08:13,022 --> 01:08:14,815
And an out.

963
01:08:14,899 --> 01:08:16,484
And an out.
You happy?

964
01:08:18,402 --> 01:08:20,571
It was a good show.
You ought to give me that.

965
01:08:21,864 --> 01:08:23,157
Sorry to keep you waiting.

966
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:25,034
Mr. Carlisle,
I don't mind waiting.

967
01:08:25,117 --> 01:08:26,160
I'm Charles Kimball.

968
01:08:26,243 --> 01:08:27,411
Judge Kimball.

969
01:08:27,495 --> 01:08:29,789
I was hoping to engage you
for a private consultation.

970
01:08:29,872 --> 01:08:31,248
Charles, may I?

971
01:08:38,631 --> 01:08:40,090
Uh...

972
01:08:40,174 --> 01:08:41,175
Charles...

973
01:08:45,596 --> 01:08:47,223
What you
experienced tonight...

974
01:08:47,306 --> 01:08:49,058
I will double
your nightly rate.

975
01:08:49,141 --> 01:08:50,810
Well, that's not the point.

976
01:08:50,893 --> 01:08:52,144
The thing is...

977
01:08:53,646 --> 01:08:55,022
Is she with you?

978
01:08:55,105 --> 01:08:57,733
Charles wanted my opinion
before engaging you.

979
01:08:57,817 --> 01:09:00,319
Well, we don't do
private consultations.

980
01:09:00,402 --> 01:09:01,862
Molly, please.

981
01:09:03,030 --> 01:09:05,658
I think Mr. Carlisle
wants an apology.

982
01:09:05,741 --> 01:09:07,076
Why would
I want that?

983
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:10,162
You provided us with
quite a show here tonight,

984
01:09:10,246 --> 01:09:11,372
so thank you.

985
01:09:17,169 --> 01:09:19,505
You seek solace?

986
01:09:21,132 --> 01:09:22,258
Yes.

987
01:09:25,469 --> 01:09:27,388
I believe we can
provide that for you.

988
01:09:27,471 --> 01:09:28,722
Stan...

989
01:09:31,684 --> 01:09:33,102
I'll do it.

990
01:09:33,686 --> 01:09:34,562
Just this once.

991
01:09:34,645 --> 01:09:37,898
Thank you.
Mr. Carlisle, thank you.

992
01:09:37,982 --> 01:09:40,109
Here, Charles.

993
01:09:40,192 --> 01:09:41,569
Have one of mine.

994
01:09:45,281 --> 01:09:46,991
This is my home.

995
01:09:47,074 --> 01:09:48,993
4:30 pm, Wednesday.

996
01:09:49,076 --> 01:09:50,703
I'll be there.

997
01:09:50,786 --> 01:09:53,289
Thank you,
Mr. Carlisle. Miss.

998
01:10:03,257 --> 01:10:06,802
"Doctor Lilith Ritter.
Consulting psychologist."

999
01:10:08,137 --> 01:10:10,848
A doctor. How about that?

1000
01:10:16,729 --> 01:10:18,856
Evening, Joseph.
Can I have some change, please?

1001
01:10:18,939 --> 01:10:19,940
Yes.

1002
01:10:20,733 --> 01:10:21,734
Thank you.

1003
01:10:21,817 --> 01:10:22,902
I know
you're angry with me.

1004
01:10:22,985 --> 01:10:23,944
Of course, you do.

1005
01:10:24,028 --> 01:10:25,571
You can read minds.
You talk to the dead,

1006
01:10:25,654 --> 01:10:26,739
- remember?
- Oh, come on, Molly.

1007
01:10:26,822 --> 01:10:28,115
Why would you say yes?

1008
01:10:28,198 --> 01:10:29,199
You saw how
desperate he was.

1009
01:10:29,283 --> 01:10:30,409
What do you want me
to say to him?

1010
01:10:30,492 --> 01:10:31,577
Say no!

1011
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:33,704
- Where you going?
- I have to make a phone call.

1012
01:10:33,787 --> 01:10:35,331
Make a phone call up
in the room.

1013
01:10:35,873 --> 01:10:36,999
Go away.

1014
01:10:38,417 --> 01:10:41,337
I'm gonna run a bath.
You better hurry up before it gets cold.

1015
01:11:08,697 --> 01:11:11,200
<i>Hostilities exist.</i>

1016
01:11:13,243 --> 01:11:20,459
<i>There is no blinking at the fact that
our people, our territory, and our...</i>

1017
01:11:20,542 --> 01:11:25,339
I was thinking you and I
can make a dent in this town.

1018
01:11:25,422 --> 01:11:29,176
You and I can make a pretty
big dent in this town.

1019
01:11:29,259 --> 01:11:32,346
I was thinking you and I can make
a pretty big dent in this town.

1020
01:12:15,222 --> 01:12:17,683
Mr. Carlisle,
come in.

1021
01:12:17,766 --> 01:12:19,143
Slow day?

1022
01:12:20,769 --> 01:12:22,146
Have you not heard?

1023
01:12:23,897 --> 01:12:25,566
We're at war.

1024
01:12:25,649 --> 01:12:26,650
I'm aware.

1025
01:12:28,986 --> 01:12:31,071
How did you know
it was me?

1026
01:12:31,155 --> 01:12:32,239
What brings you here?

1027
01:12:32,322 --> 01:12:34,116
You left me your card,
didn't you?

1028
01:12:35,492 --> 01:12:39,580
So, here we are.

1029
01:12:39,663 --> 01:12:41,623
Oh, not me.
I never drink.

1030
01:12:45,294 --> 01:12:46,462
Microphones.

1031
01:12:46,545 --> 01:12:49,089
That's right.
Wire recorder.

1032
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:51,175
Are you recording this?

1033
01:12:51,258 --> 01:12:52,760
No.

1034
01:12:52,843 --> 01:12:57,514
My office is wired to record
all analysis sessions.

1035
01:12:57,598 --> 01:12:59,767
You got a smoother line,
but you run a racket.

1036
01:12:59,850 --> 01:13:01,226
Same as me.

1037
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:02,853
Is that what this is?

1038
01:13:09,026 --> 01:13:11,195
How did you know
I had a pistol?

1039
01:13:12,946 --> 01:13:14,615
I can read
a mark quick.

1040
01:13:14,698 --> 01:13:15,908
Find out what they want.

1041
01:13:18,702 --> 01:13:20,079
And I'm a mark, am I?

1042
01:13:22,164 --> 01:13:24,124
What do I want?

1043
01:13:24,208 --> 01:13:26,960
To be found out.
Same as everybody else.

1044
01:13:28,128 --> 01:13:29,880
Is that it?

1045
01:13:29,963 --> 01:13:33,008
Think out things that most people
want, hit 'em where they live...

1046
01:13:33,092 --> 01:13:34,343
health, wealth, love.

1047
01:13:34,426 --> 01:13:37,179
Find out what they're afraid
of and sell it back to them.

1048
01:13:38,931 --> 01:13:40,682
As long as
you don't oversell it.

1049
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:46,522
You wanna know
how I knew about the gun?

1050
01:13:49,233 --> 01:13:51,819
I removed the blindfold
both for dramatic effect

1051
01:13:51,902 --> 01:13:53,904
and to get a rise
out of the audience,

1052
01:13:53,987 --> 01:13:55,656
but also to see the way
you held your clutch.

1053
01:13:55,739 --> 01:13:58,450
Elbow bent forward,
clutch was heavy.

1054
01:13:58,534 --> 01:14:01,453
And you lifted it with your
left, no wedding ring.

1055
01:14:01,537 --> 01:14:02,871
No tan mark, unmarried.

1056
01:14:02,955 --> 01:14:04,665
So, you like to go
out at night,

1057
01:14:04,748 --> 01:14:07,626
you were at the Copa
so you got the bees,

1058
01:14:07,709 --> 01:14:10,379
but I assume you like to go to
lower places, too, don't you?

1059
01:14:10,462 --> 01:14:12,589
If I want mud on my skirt,
I can find it.

1060
01:14:13,966 --> 01:14:15,634
Well, you live alone.

1061
01:14:15,717 --> 01:14:17,010
No man in the house.

1062
01:14:17,094 --> 01:14:18,303
Gotta have a gun at home,

1063
01:14:18,387 --> 01:14:20,556
but you assume yourself to be a
lady, so not a big pipe.

1064
01:14:20,639 --> 01:14:23,684
Something small, portable, .22,
.25, four, six shot, maybe.

1065
01:14:23,767 --> 01:14:26,895
And since you like pretty things,
nickel plated, ivory handle.

1066
01:14:27,896 --> 01:14:30,023
But you talked
about my mother.

1067
01:14:32,276 --> 01:14:33,944
Why?

1068
01:14:34,027 --> 01:14:35,904
Well, dames like you
always have mommy issues.

1069
01:14:35,988 --> 01:14:37,364
Daddy issues, too.

1070
01:14:40,117 --> 01:14:41,910
I see.

1071
01:14:41,994 --> 01:14:43,662
An Electra complex,
is it?

1072
01:14:43,745 --> 01:14:44,788
I wouldn't know about that.

1073
01:14:44,872 --> 01:14:47,708
But you're not as hard to
read as you think, lady.

1074
01:14:51,962 --> 01:14:55,465
If I'm so easy to read,
why come see me then?

1075
01:14:55,549 --> 01:14:58,385
That judge, he's a pretty
big deal in this town, is he?

1076
01:15:01,763 --> 01:15:05,017
Judge Kimball.
Doesn't get much bigger.

1077
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:06,685
He a patient of yours?

1078
01:15:07,978 --> 01:15:09,146
Friend of my father's.

1079
01:15:09,229 --> 01:15:10,606
Y'all jazzy together?

1080
01:15:13,275 --> 01:15:15,402
Now, why would
you ask that?

1081
01:15:15,485 --> 01:15:17,029
Because you have
a handle on him.

1082
01:15:17,112 --> 01:15:18,489
His wife is
a patient of mine.

1083
01:15:18,572 --> 01:15:20,782
- Mmm.
- Interesting woman, Felicia.

1084
01:15:24,536 --> 01:15:26,580
Have you ever been
in analysis?

1085
01:15:27,915 --> 01:15:29,458
I wouldn't know
what to talk about.

1086
01:15:29,541 --> 01:15:31,293
Simple. What are you
thinking about?

1087
01:15:31,376 --> 01:15:32,669
- Now?
- Now.

1088
01:15:32,753 --> 01:15:33,879
You.

1089
01:15:33,962 --> 01:15:35,005
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.

1090
01:15:35,088 --> 01:15:36,381
- What about me?
- That you come a little closer

1091
01:15:36,465 --> 01:15:38,008
so I can get
a better look at you.

1092
01:15:39,343 --> 01:15:40,886
Is that why you're here?

1093
01:15:42,054 --> 01:15:42,971
To look at me?

1094
01:15:43,055 --> 01:15:44,640
No, I'm just thinking
that if you help me,

1095
01:15:44,723 --> 01:15:46,934
we can make quite a
big dent in this town.

1096
01:15:47,017 --> 01:15:48,310
- We?
- Mm-hmm.

1097
01:15:48,393 --> 01:15:51,813
You give me something on that
judge, any of the other higher ups,

1098
01:15:51,897 --> 01:15:54,316
I'll make it
worth your while.

1099
01:15:54,399 --> 01:15:57,152
You think you got something big
enough or interesting enough for me?

1100
01:15:57,236 --> 01:15:59,196
Well, nothing matters in this
goddamn world but dough,

1101
01:15:59,279 --> 01:16:00,489
and you get that raw.

1102
01:16:04,076 --> 01:16:05,827
All right.

1103
01:16:05,911 --> 01:16:07,746
I'll give you something.

1104
01:16:07,829 --> 01:16:09,164
In exchange
for the truth.

1105
01:16:09,248 --> 01:16:10,374
Truth about what?

1106
01:16:10,457 --> 01:16:12,000
Yourself.

1107
01:16:12,084 --> 01:16:16,713
I give you a little information
and you tell me the truth.

1108
01:16:25,055 --> 01:16:26,265
And don't lie.

1109
01:16:27,849 --> 01:16:29,560
I'll know
if you're lying.

1110
01:16:31,478 --> 01:16:32,562
That it?

1111
01:16:35,148 --> 01:16:36,233
Shoot.

1112
01:16:40,946 --> 01:16:42,823
Kimball lost a son.

1113
01:16:45,242 --> 01:16:46,493
An only child.

1114
01:16:47,911 --> 01:16:48,912
Julian.

1115
01:16:50,122 --> 01:16:51,915
23 years old.

1116
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,459
Don't write
anything down.

1117
01:16:56,128 --> 01:16:58,297
This is not
a carnival trick.

1118
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:00,340
You are to leave
no trace.

1119
01:17:00,424 --> 01:17:02,634
No writing.
Understood.

1120
01:17:08,849 --> 01:17:14,271
Julian enlisted against Felicia's
wishes and died in No Man's Land.

1121
01:17:22,029 --> 01:17:23,614
I can work with that.

1122
01:17:24,614 --> 01:17:27,200
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you very much.

1123
01:17:27,284 --> 01:17:28,410
Miss Cahill.

1124
01:17:41,256 --> 01:17:43,383
I'm sorry it took
this long to call you.

1125
01:17:43,467 --> 01:17:44,676
<i>Yeah. You know,</i>

1126
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:46,553
<i>when you didn't call
in the fall, I thought...</i>

1127
01:17:47,971 --> 01:17:49,431
I know, I'm sorry.

1128
01:17:50,932 --> 01:17:52,392
Do you think you all might
come to visit us

1129
01:17:52,476 --> 01:17:54,686
before you close
for the winter?

1130
01:17:54,770 --> 01:17:55,812
<i>Hey, Molly?</i>

1131
01:17:57,731 --> 01:17:59,691
<i>You all right?
It's all I wanna know.</i>

1132
01:17:59,775 --> 01:18:03,987
I'm fine. Really, I am.
Everything's Jake, Bruno.

1133
01:18:04,071 --> 01:18:06,948
I have to go,
but I miss you all.

1134
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:10,744
Send my love
to The Major and to Zeena?

1135
01:18:10,827 --> 01:18:12,704
And to everybody?

1136
01:18:12,788 --> 01:18:13,830
<i>Anytime.</i>

1137
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:23,715
So, how's this
gonna work, lady?

1138
01:18:27,386 --> 01:18:28,678
Doctor.

1139
01:18:30,013 --> 01:18:31,306
Doctor.

1140
01:18:32,808 --> 01:18:34,017
Lay down, please.

1141
01:18:39,523 --> 01:18:41,858
I think I'll just sit,
if that's okay.

1142
01:18:41,942 --> 01:18:44,111
We can go much deeper
if you do.

1143
01:18:45,529 --> 01:18:47,406
Why don't we just
start with sitting?

1144
01:18:56,123 --> 01:19:00,544
When I offered you a drink,
you said you never drank.

1145
01:19:00,627 --> 01:19:01,962
Because I don't.

1146
01:19:03,171 --> 01:19:06,258
But you made it
a point of pride.

1147
01:19:06,341 --> 01:19:08,343
You could've taken the glass
and not drunk.

1148
01:19:08,427 --> 01:19:12,222
You could've said,
"Not right now," and set it aside.

1149
01:19:12,305 --> 01:19:15,183
But you said,
"No. Not me. I never drink."

1150
01:19:15,267 --> 01:19:16,560
You can't do
mentalism and drink.

1151
01:19:16,643 --> 01:19:18,979
You gotta be
on your toes all the time.

1152
01:19:19,062 --> 01:19:20,897
When you're on,
you're on.

1153
01:19:21,565 --> 01:19:23,191
And you're on now?

1154
01:19:23,275 --> 01:19:24,776
I'm always on, Doctor.

1155
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:26,778
Did your father drink?

1156
01:19:31,241 --> 01:19:33,618
He went White Ribbon
when I was 10.

1157
01:19:33,702 --> 01:19:35,454
But before?

1158
01:19:35,537 --> 01:19:38,039
Clearly, before, he did,
if you knew what White Ribbon meant.

1159
01:19:44,087 --> 01:19:47,507
When I poured the whiskey,
you winced.

1160
01:19:48,508 --> 01:19:50,093
- Why?
- Did I?

1161
01:19:51,136 --> 01:19:52,721
Yes.

1162
01:19:52,804 --> 01:19:55,015
That's not something
I need to talk to you about.

1163
01:19:55,098 --> 01:19:56,933
The truth.
We shook on it.

1164
01:20:03,565 --> 01:20:06,151
I didn't like the way
it smelled, was all.

1165
01:20:06,234 --> 01:20:08,236
You were 12 feet away.

1166
01:20:09,779 --> 01:20:11,948
Stuff smelled off to me.

1167
01:20:12,032 --> 01:20:14,242
- How so?
- Smelled like wood alcohol.

1168
01:20:15,368 --> 01:20:17,162
You drank wood alcohol?

1169
01:20:17,245 --> 01:20:19,122
No. Not me. Never.

1170
01:20:19,206 --> 01:20:20,457
"Never."

1171
01:20:21,333 --> 01:20:22,709
It's that word again.

1172
01:20:23,710 --> 01:20:25,003
Please lie down.

1173
01:20:30,509 --> 01:20:31,676
Please.

1174
01:20:43,104 --> 01:20:44,314
I, uh...

1175
01:20:45,565 --> 01:20:47,943
It's a guy that I knew.

1176
01:20:48,026 --> 01:20:51,488
He tanked up on wood alky
and he kicked off.

1177
01:20:53,823 --> 01:20:56,660
What are you
thinking about now?

1178
01:20:56,743 --> 01:21:00,038
It makes no sense.

1179
01:21:00,121 --> 01:21:01,373
Take your time.

1180
01:21:04,668 --> 01:21:06,962
Pianos.

1181
01:21:09,464 --> 01:21:10,632
Elaborate.

1182
01:21:17,222 --> 01:21:18,598
My mother.

1183
01:21:20,308 --> 01:21:22,227
Did she
play the piano?

1184
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:24,437
What's that have to do
with anything?

1185
01:21:24,521 --> 01:21:25,522
Did she drink?

1186
01:21:25,605 --> 01:21:26,940
Now and again,
like everybody else.

1187
01:21:27,023 --> 01:21:28,608
Not you.

1188
01:21:28,692 --> 01:21:30,068
You never drink.

1189
01:21:31,486 --> 01:21:33,405
She was beautiful,
your mother.

1190
01:21:36,575 --> 01:21:37,784
To me.

1191
01:21:41,204 --> 01:21:43,873
Who played the piano,
Mr. Carlisle?

1192
01:21:43,957 --> 01:21:46,126
Guy named Humphries.

1193
01:21:46,209 --> 01:21:50,922
He was a friend of my folks.
He was in Vaudeville.

1194
01:21:51,006 --> 01:21:54,467
How old was the man at the carnival?
The one who died?

1195
01:21:54,551 --> 01:21:55,594
What did you say
his name was?

1196
01:21:55,677 --> 01:21:57,637
I didn't say.
I didn't think I said...

1197
01:22:10,066 --> 01:22:11,192
Pete.

1198
01:22:11,901 --> 01:22:13,028
Pete.

1199
01:22:16,239 --> 01:22:18,491
How did Pete
get the alcohol?

1200
01:22:21,036 --> 01:22:22,203
I gave it to him.

1201
01:22:25,707 --> 01:22:27,584
But it was a mistake.

1202
01:22:29,961 --> 01:22:31,296
Mistake?

1203
01:22:32,964 --> 01:22:34,382
What was he to you?

1204
01:22:34,466 --> 01:22:36,384
- Did you admire him?
- Parts of him.

1205
01:22:36,468 --> 01:22:38,011
I think you pitied him.

1206
01:22:39,304 --> 01:22:40,597
I don't know.

1207
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:43,475
He had his fair shake,
he just blew it.

1208
01:22:43,558 --> 01:22:45,727
Did Pete teach you things?

1209
01:22:47,437 --> 01:22:48,647
Yes.

1210
01:22:48,730 --> 01:22:50,690
He was older,
wasn't he?

1211
01:22:50,774 --> 01:22:52,651
He was old enough
to be your father.

1212
01:22:56,446 --> 01:22:57,572
I think we've done enough.

1213
01:22:57,656 --> 01:22:59,616
Did you ever stutter
as a child?

1214
01:22:59,699 --> 01:23:00,867
No.

1215
01:23:00,950 --> 01:23:03,203
Because you have a slight movement.
Compulsory movement.

1216
01:23:03,286 --> 01:23:05,288
Your head moves up and
down, ever so slightly.

1217
01:23:05,372 --> 01:23:07,832
And Humphries.

1218
01:23:07,916 --> 01:23:10,293
Was he ever inappropriate
or abusive to you as a child?

1219
01:23:10,377 --> 01:23:11,628
Shut your mouth.
Shut your mouth.

1220
01:23:11,711 --> 01:23:13,713
It's all right, Stanton.
Answer me.

1221
01:23:13,797 --> 01:23:15,048
Humphries took
my mother away

1222
01:23:15,131 --> 01:23:17,717
because my father wasn't man enough
to hold on to her, all right?

1223
01:23:17,801 --> 01:23:19,135
Bible spouting hypocrite.

1224
01:23:19,219 --> 01:23:22,430
Always selling his tall tales
about Jesus and a happy afterlife.

1225
01:23:23,807 --> 01:23:24,891
And what
do you sell?

1226
01:23:24,975 --> 01:23:26,726
I'm a hustler
and I know it.

1227
01:23:26,810 --> 01:23:28,603
I'm on the make and I know it.
Get it?

1228
01:23:30,021 --> 01:23:33,066
I am nothing like my old man,
and I never will be.

1229
01:23:34,192 --> 01:23:35,443
"Never."

1230
01:23:36,611 --> 01:23:37,987
That word again.

1231
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:41,700
We're going
to work on that.

1232
01:24:18,987 --> 01:24:20,947
He's working on his
disappearing act right now.

1233
01:24:21,030 --> 01:24:22,115
He can't stop.

1234
01:24:22,198 --> 01:24:23,283
- He cannot stop himself.
- Gonna be a headliner.

1235
01:24:23,366 --> 01:24:24,951
Something for the road.

1236
01:24:32,667 --> 01:24:33,960
I invited them.
Are you mad?

1237
01:24:34,043 --> 01:24:35,128
Why would I be?

1238
01:24:39,758 --> 01:24:41,217
Hello, Stan.

1239
01:24:41,301 --> 01:24:43,845
We're on our way to Gibtown,
thought we'd visit a while like old pals.

1240
01:24:48,433 --> 01:24:50,018
Oh, George.

1241
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:52,312
You guys get
something to eat?

1242
01:24:52,395 --> 01:24:53,855
Just drinks.

1243
01:24:53,938 --> 01:24:55,648
- Should order some food?
- Sure.

1244
01:24:55,732 --> 01:24:57,233
How long you staying?

1245
01:24:58,401 --> 01:24:59,986
Uh, not long.

1246
01:25:10,955 --> 01:25:12,207
Mmm.

1247
01:25:14,375 --> 01:25:15,794
Okay. Ready?

1248
01:25:23,259 --> 01:25:24,803
That's right.

1249
01:25:24,886 --> 01:25:26,596
There you go!

1250
01:25:37,106 --> 01:25:39,192
You're doing well.

1251
01:25:39,275 --> 01:25:42,403
Well, it's the same grift,
just different threads.

1252
01:25:42,487 --> 01:25:44,155
And...

1253
01:25:49,494 --> 01:25:51,412
Don't do the spook show.

1254
01:25:57,460 --> 01:25:58,962
Don't do
the spook show.

1255
01:25:59,879 --> 01:26:01,840
Is that why
she called you?

1256
01:26:01,923 --> 01:26:06,052
What? No. She didn't tell me.
No. It's all in the cards.

1257
01:26:06,136 --> 01:26:08,429
Well, save it
for the chumps, Zeena.

1258
01:26:08,513 --> 01:26:11,224
Hah!

1259
01:26:11,307 --> 01:26:13,643
Fine. Then you do it.

1260
01:26:13,726 --> 01:26:15,937
Three card question,
it'll take two seconds.

1261
01:26:17,730 --> 01:26:18,898
I'll oblige.

1262
01:26:24,362 --> 01:26:25,947
Downfall.

1263
01:26:26,030 --> 01:26:27,240
Impending danger.

1264
01:26:32,203 --> 01:26:34,080
An urgent choice.

1265
01:26:34,163 --> 01:26:36,416
Now, Stanton,
this is the last card.

1266
01:26:36,499 --> 01:26:37,709
It's a decree.

1267
01:26:37,792 --> 01:26:40,879
You turn it, you're gonna
find out what's coming to you.

1268
01:26:50,763 --> 01:26:52,265
The Hanged Man.

1269
01:26:53,099 --> 01:26:54,267
It's upside down.

1270
01:26:57,854 --> 01:26:59,772
But you can
still choose, Stan.

1271
01:26:59,856 --> 01:27:00,773
Well, you said
so yourself,

1272
01:27:00,857 --> 01:27:03,026
"There's no such thing
as bad cards," remember?

1273
01:27:04,861 --> 01:27:06,905
Just depends on what you do with it.
Look.

1274
01:27:09,073 --> 01:27:10,116
I fixed it.

1275
01:27:12,535 --> 01:27:13,620
I fixed it.

1276
01:27:19,417 --> 01:27:20,835
Keep that image
in your mind.

1277
01:27:20,919 --> 01:27:22,128
Okay.

1278
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:33,222
He loved you so
very, very much.

1279
01:27:33,306 --> 01:27:35,683
I can sense that
so clearly.

1280
01:27:38,227 --> 01:27:40,772
Even though you didn't see
eye to eye from time to time.

1281
01:27:40,855 --> 01:27:42,899
Oh.

1282
01:27:42,982 --> 01:27:46,069
No, that is true.
We did not.

1283
01:27:47,570 --> 01:27:48,696
May I touch
that photograph?

1284
01:27:48,780 --> 01:27:49,989
- Is that okay?
- Yes, yes.

1285
01:27:50,073 --> 01:27:52,617
That could give me
a deeper line to him.

1286
01:28:08,216 --> 01:28:09,759
He died suddenly.

1287
01:28:13,012 --> 01:28:16,683
But he wants you to know
that he was in no pain.

1288
01:28:19,310 --> 01:28:20,812
He wants you
to know that

1289
01:28:21,896 --> 01:28:26,818
it hurts him
so very, very much

1290
01:28:26,901 --> 01:28:29,237
to know that
you miss him because...

1291
01:28:29,320 --> 01:28:30,780
well, he says
that he...

1292
01:28:32,949 --> 01:28:35,493
He says that you should know
with absolute certainty

1293
01:28:35,576 --> 01:28:39,539
that you will all be
together again in time.

1294
01:28:41,874 --> 01:28:43,418
Is he here?

1295
01:28:43,501 --> 01:28:46,421
Is he here?
Can I speak to him?

1296
01:28:49,173 --> 01:28:50,758
Speak to him.

1297
01:28:52,385 --> 01:28:53,845
When you left...

1298
01:28:58,349 --> 01:29:02,020
you took all life
with you.

1299
01:29:06,733 --> 01:29:10,319
Your father wanted you
to enlist, I did not.

1300
01:29:11,904 --> 01:29:16,034
But I'm the
one who's left with nothing.

1301
01:29:17,660 --> 01:29:18,786
Yes.

1302
01:29:22,874 --> 01:29:24,584
Your 5:00 is here.

1303
01:29:24,667 --> 01:29:26,502
I don't have a 5:00.

1304
01:29:26,586 --> 01:29:27,837
<i>He's here.</i>

1305
01:29:30,256 --> 01:29:31,549
Doctor.

1306
01:29:31,632 --> 01:29:32,633
Mr. Carlisle.

1307
01:29:34,510 --> 01:29:35,678
What's that?

1308
01:29:35,762 --> 01:29:38,014
Your half.
That's a split. 50-50.

1309
01:29:38,097 --> 01:29:40,475
Not interested.
I got what I wanted.

1310
01:29:40,558 --> 01:29:42,685
But you should've
seen 'em.

1311
01:29:42,769 --> 01:29:44,020
My God.

1312
01:29:44,103 --> 01:29:47,065
I think they'll be talking
about that the rest of his life.

1313
01:29:47,148 --> 01:29:50,443
And I think every time they tell it,
it'll just get better and better,

1314
01:29:50,526 --> 01:29:51,527
bigger and bigger.

1315
01:29:51,611 --> 01:29:53,488
A toast, then.
To your success.

1316
01:29:53,571 --> 01:29:56,699
Uh, he asked me to, uh,

1317
01:29:56,783 --> 01:29:58,201
see one of his friends.

1318
01:29:59,202 --> 01:30:00,328
And who might
that be?

1319
01:30:00,411 --> 01:30:02,080
He didn't say,
but I'm considering it.

1320
01:30:04,290 --> 01:30:06,042
I'll tell you what,
you got a safe?

1321
01:30:08,086 --> 01:30:09,253
I do.

1322
01:30:10,338 --> 01:30:11,255
Why don't you
keep this for me?

1323
01:30:11,339 --> 01:30:14,050
I don't want Molly to know
about it anyway.

1324
01:30:14,133 --> 01:30:16,010
Why don't you keep it
for a few days?

1325
01:30:16,094 --> 01:30:19,305
If you change your mind,
we'll spilt it 50-50.

1326
01:30:19,388 --> 01:30:21,057
And if not,
I'll keep it.

1327
01:30:30,233 --> 01:30:31,692
You barely know me.

1328
01:30:35,029 --> 01:30:36,447
Oh, I know you well.

1329
01:30:40,535 --> 01:30:41,786
I know...

1330
01:30:43,496 --> 01:30:44,956
you're no good.

1331
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:50,461
And I know that 'cause...

1332
01:30:53,214 --> 01:30:54,674
neither am I.

1333
01:30:57,260 --> 01:30:58,761
Is that so?

1334
01:31:01,556 --> 01:31:02,640
Yes.

1335
01:31:10,690 --> 01:31:12,275
You're asking
for the shape.

1336
01:31:15,945 --> 01:31:17,572
What if I do two?

1337
01:31:20,491 --> 01:31:21,659
Color.

1338
01:31:24,954 --> 01:31:26,205
That's good.

1339
01:31:32,795 --> 01:31:34,463
I'm too hard on us.

1340
01:31:36,257 --> 01:31:38,551
No, you're right about it.

1341
01:31:38,634 --> 01:31:39,927
You need a break.

1342
01:31:43,848 --> 01:31:45,641
Whatever you wanna do,
we'll do.

1343
01:31:48,227 --> 01:31:49,520
Can we go dancing?

1344
01:31:49,604 --> 01:31:50,688
Absolutely.

1345
01:31:50,771 --> 01:31:51,939
<i>Call for Stanton Carlisle.</i>

1346
01:31:53,274 --> 01:31:54,484
Whatever you want.

1347
01:31:54,567 --> 01:31:55,234
<i>You can
pick it up on house phone.</i>

1348
01:31:55,318 --> 01:31:57,778
We'll go tonight
after the show.

1349
01:31:57,862 --> 01:31:59,989
I'm dying in here, Stan.

1350
01:32:03,242 --> 01:32:04,493
I love you.

1351
01:32:17,381 --> 01:32:18,966
Yeah.

1352
01:32:19,050 --> 01:32:23,095
<i>The man Kimball wants to
introduce you to is Ezra Grindle.</i>

1353
01:32:23,179 --> 01:32:26,265
Grindle was a patient of mine
for a brief time.

1354
01:32:26,349 --> 01:32:28,059
He's unstable.
Unpredictable.

1355
01:32:30,770 --> 01:32:31,771
How is he fixed for dough?

1356
01:32:31,854 --> 01:32:34,315
<i>Oh, he's very rich.
Very powerful.</i>

1357
01:32:34,398 --> 01:32:36,817
<i>And intensely private.</i>

1358
01:32:36,901 --> 01:32:39,528
Dealings with Grindle
have consequences.

1359
01:32:39,612 --> 01:32:40,738
Permanent ones.

1360
01:32:43,616 --> 01:32:45,409
Well, you better
give me an angle.

1361
01:33:05,137 --> 01:33:08,975
Coat, hat, and gloves
on the counter.

1362
01:33:09,058 --> 01:33:11,102
And empty your pockets.

1363
01:33:11,185 --> 01:33:16,023
No pencils, no pens, no keys,
no cigarettes, or lighter.

1364
01:33:19,735 --> 01:33:20,820
Hands up.

1365
01:33:24,573 --> 01:33:25,658
Turn around.

1366
01:33:26,993 --> 01:33:28,995
I need your watch
and your ring.

1367
01:33:31,372 --> 01:33:32,790
Manners, friend.

1368
01:33:33,874 --> 01:33:34,917
What was that?

1369
01:33:35,001 --> 01:33:36,502
You should say "please."

1370
01:33:38,587 --> 01:33:39,588
Please.

1371
01:33:52,810 --> 01:33:54,145
Mr. Carlisle.

1372
01:33:55,187 --> 01:33:56,564
I'm Ezra Grindle.

1373
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:01,277
Let me take your jacket.

1374
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:02,361
Please.

1375
01:34:04,363 --> 01:34:06,115
I'm very wary
of appearing in public,

1376
01:34:06,198 --> 01:34:08,618
so I want to thank you
for coming to see me.

1377
01:34:08,701 --> 01:34:10,077
A man of your talents.

1378
01:34:10,161 --> 01:34:11,954
Well, that's very
kind of you.

1379
01:34:12,038 --> 01:34:13,873
Wouldn't count on that.

1380
01:34:14,749 --> 01:34:15,875
Take a seat.

1381
01:34:20,463 --> 01:34:22,131
What is this?

1382
01:34:22,214 --> 01:34:24,550
This is our version
of a polygraph.

1383
01:34:25,509 --> 01:34:26,635
You familiar with the term?

1384
01:34:26,719 --> 01:34:28,554
You call it a lie detector.

1385
01:34:29,764 --> 01:34:31,557
You'd like to
perform this on me?

1386
01:34:31,640 --> 01:34:32,892
That's the general idea, yeah.

1387
01:34:35,478 --> 01:34:36,937
We will measure
your blood pressure,

1388
01:34:37,021 --> 01:34:40,775
respiration, involuntary
muscle contractions.

1389
01:34:40,858 --> 01:34:42,777
Not sure how comfortable
I am with this.

1390
01:34:42,860 --> 01:34:45,988
Well, we've had our share of
snake charmers in the past.

1391
01:34:46,072 --> 01:34:47,615
We deal with them.

1392
01:34:47,698 --> 01:34:48,991
Raise your arms, please.

1393
01:34:51,243 --> 01:34:53,204
I don't think
this is necessary.

1394
01:34:53,287 --> 01:34:54,955
Can you watch
my tie, please?

1395
01:34:55,915 --> 01:34:57,708
- I'll watch it.
- Thank you.

1396
01:34:57,792 --> 01:34:59,794
And what happens
if I fail?

1397
01:34:59,877 --> 01:35:03,422
One thing at a time, hmm?

1398
01:35:03,506 --> 01:35:06,967
I will ask you simple
questions to establish our baseline.

1399
01:35:07,051 --> 01:35:08,677
You will answer
in short sentences,

1400
01:35:08,761 --> 01:35:11,138
only what you believe
to be absolute truth.

1401
01:35:12,848 --> 01:35:15,267
"Absolute truth."

1402
01:35:15,351 --> 01:35:17,353
I can do that.

1403
01:35:20,940 --> 01:35:22,066
Now,

1404
01:35:22,149 --> 01:35:25,027
brief as you can,
what is your name?

1405
01:35:25,111 --> 01:35:26,487
Stanton Carlisle.

1406
01:35:27,738 --> 01:35:29,407
What year are we in?

1407
01:35:30,366 --> 01:35:33,202
1941.

1408
01:35:33,285 --> 01:35:34,370
Good.

1409
01:35:34,453 --> 01:35:36,247
What day is today?

1410
01:35:38,749 --> 01:35:40,209
Wednesday, I think.

1411
01:35:42,002 --> 01:35:43,879
Who is the president
of the United States?

1412
01:35:44,422 --> 01:35:45,548
Roosevelt.

1413
01:35:48,259 --> 01:35:53,514
Very well. Now, as briefly as you
can, are you a true medium?

1414
01:35:53,597 --> 01:35:54,598
Yes, I am.

1415
01:35:59,854 --> 01:36:00,855
Can you read minds?

1416
01:36:00,938 --> 01:36:04,358
Yes, I can.
Under the right circumstances.

1417
01:36:06,610 --> 01:36:07,611
Brief.

1418
01:36:09,238 --> 01:36:11,449
Keep your answers
brief, please.

1419
01:36:11,532 --> 01:36:14,034
Now, are you in contact
with the beyond?

1420
01:36:27,423 --> 01:36:29,300
Before we go on,
there's a...

1421
01:36:33,429 --> 01:36:36,056
There is a presence
in this room.

1422
01:36:36,140 --> 01:36:37,349
Right now.

1423
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:41,479
It's a female presence.

1424
01:36:50,905 --> 01:36:54,033
She's just insisting,
she's insisting that this...

1425
01:36:56,202 --> 01:36:57,828
that she communicate
with somebody.

1426
01:36:57,912 --> 01:37:00,289
Is it me? Do you wanna
communicate with me?

1427
01:37:00,372 --> 01:37:01,665
Is it him?

1428
01:37:03,292 --> 01:37:04,627
Oh, it's you, Mr. Grindle.

1429
01:37:08,214 --> 01:37:09,465
I don't... I don't...

1430
01:37:12,635 --> 01:37:15,846
Oh. She... She passed away
many years ago.

1431
01:37:18,390 --> 01:37:19,683
Oh, but there was...

1432
01:37:22,228 --> 01:37:24,313
Yeah, there was
a life extinguished with it.

1433
01:37:24,396 --> 01:37:25,648
And it... it...

1434
01:37:29,151 --> 01:37:31,237
Oh, it was a child.
It was a baby.

1435
01:37:35,324 --> 01:37:37,493
You forced her to miscarry,
did you not?

1436
01:37:49,547 --> 01:37:50,548
Shall I go on?

1437
01:37:50,965 --> 01:37:51,966
No.

1438
01:37:52,841 --> 01:37:54,426
There's no need.

1439
01:37:55,594 --> 01:37:57,513
A word in my office,
gentlemen.

1440
01:38:00,850 --> 01:38:02,059
You said you were
gonna fine-tune it.

1441
01:38:02,142 --> 01:38:03,060
Yes, sir.

1442
01:38:03,143 --> 01:38:04,728
You fine-tuned it incorrectly?

1443
01:38:04,812 --> 01:38:05,771
- No, no, no.
- Ezra...

1444
01:38:05,854 --> 01:38:07,106
You had two and two.

1445
01:38:07,189 --> 01:38:08,190
Two wrong, two right.

1446
01:38:10,192 --> 01:38:11,402
Stop, stop!

1447
01:38:11,485 --> 01:38:13,654
Answer me this, you brought
him straight from the club.

1448
01:38:13,737 --> 01:38:15,364
How could he know that? How?

1449
01:38:45,060 --> 01:38:46,061
Well,

1450
01:38:47,146 --> 01:38:48,689
got him hooked real good.

1451
01:38:50,566 --> 01:38:51,775
Despite all that.

1452
01:38:57,615 --> 01:38:59,241
He's got quite
an operation.

1453
01:39:00,284 --> 01:39:01,827
And he's gonna
call back?

1454
01:39:04,830 --> 01:39:06,624
Oh, yeah,
he's gonna call back.

1455
01:39:06,707 --> 01:39:08,417
I left real money
on the table.

1456
01:39:09,501 --> 01:39:11,378
Gotta leave money
to get money.

1457
01:39:20,220 --> 01:39:22,556
You're gonna have to give me
some real information on him now.

1458
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:24,266
No. Not me.

1459
01:39:29,396 --> 01:39:30,731
I figured.

1460
01:39:32,941 --> 01:39:35,486
I'm the only one who could've
given you that information.

1461
01:39:37,821 --> 01:39:39,782
If your foot slips,

1462
01:39:40,991 --> 01:39:42,034
we both fall.

1463
01:39:49,833 --> 01:39:51,752
Don't worry.
I'll figure it out.

1464
01:39:55,047 --> 01:39:56,298
I mean, this guy's, uh,

1465
01:39:57,758 --> 01:40:00,052
he's real deep
on the spook dodge.

1466
01:40:05,683 --> 01:40:07,142
I don't think
you have a problem.

1467
01:40:08,477 --> 01:40:09,978
I'd say he's very desperate.

1468
01:40:13,023 --> 01:40:14,900
Don't worry. They'll never
trace it back to you.

1469
01:40:27,079 --> 01:40:28,997
The thing
you need to know is,

1470
01:40:30,249 --> 01:40:33,502
if you displease
the right people,

1471
01:40:33,585 --> 01:40:37,297
the world closes in on you
very, very fast.

1472
01:41:01,780 --> 01:41:03,365
What happened to you?

1473
01:41:06,702 --> 01:41:07,786
Life.

1474
01:41:11,415 --> 01:41:12,916
Life happened to me.

1475
01:41:51,580 --> 01:41:53,248
<i>Patient Ezra Grindle.</i>

1476
01:41:53,332 --> 01:41:55,167
<i>Therapy session number four.</i>

1477
01:41:55,250 --> 01:41:57,377
<i>I am alone.</i>

1478
01:41:57,461 --> 01:41:59,046
<i>Lost.</i>

1479
01:41:59,129 --> 01:42:01,173
<i>I feel lost.</i>

1480
01:42:01,256 --> 01:42:03,258
<i>Everything I earn
feels hollow.</i>

1481
01:42:03,342 --> 01:42:05,385
<i>Would you elaborate, please?</i>

1482
01:42:07,179 --> 01:42:09,473
<i>May, 1901.</i>

1483
01:42:09,556 --> 01:42:11,558
<i>The last time I saw her alive.</i>

1484
01:42:12,726 --> 01:42:15,145
<i>I didn't... I...</i>

1485
01:42:15,229 --> 01:42:16,480
"Doris Mae Cable."

1486
01:42:16,563 --> 01:42:17,898
<i>I couldn't
claim her body.</i>

1487
01:42:17,981 --> 01:42:19,858
...property for
register number 28030.

1488
01:42:19,942 --> 01:42:21,735
<i>Because
I would've been ruined.</i>

1489
01:42:23,487 --> 01:42:26,824
<i>So my love went
to a commoners' grave.</i>

1490
01:42:26,907 --> 01:42:28,325
Thank you kindly.

1491
01:42:47,970 --> 01:42:49,263
There you are.

1492
01:43:55,996 --> 01:43:58,624
So I wanted to know
what impression you got from her.

1493
01:43:58,707 --> 01:44:01,960
The girl that, uh,
you sensed during the test.

1494
01:44:02,044 --> 01:44:03,378
I didn't see her.

1495
01:44:03,462 --> 01:44:04,880
She didn't materialize.

1496
01:44:06,214 --> 01:44:09,134
But by that,
you mean she could?

1497
01:44:09,217 --> 01:44:11,720
Well, it was very brief,
uh, Mr. Grindle.

1498
01:44:11,803 --> 01:44:13,639
Uh, Ezra, please.

1499
01:44:13,722 --> 01:44:17,851
I sensed
profound sadness and regret.

1500
01:44:18,852 --> 01:44:20,687
She loved you.

1501
01:44:20,771 --> 01:44:23,857
And that boy.
That baby boy.

1502
01:44:29,237 --> 01:44:30,781
It was a boy?

1503
01:44:33,200 --> 01:44:34,534
Is she with me?

1504
01:44:35,369 --> 01:44:36,787
She's never far.

1505
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:43,085
This place important to you?
This garden?

1506
01:44:43,168 --> 01:44:46,713
Yes. I built it,
uh, to honor her.

1507
01:44:46,797 --> 01:44:50,050
The paths and the benches,
you see?

1508
01:44:50,133 --> 01:44:51,510
She would've loved it.

1509
01:44:51,593 --> 01:44:52,928
She does.

1510
01:44:53,762 --> 01:44:54,930
I can sense it.

1511
01:44:58,809 --> 01:45:00,477
Brother Ezra, she...

1512
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:02,396
she's trying to
tell me something.

1513
01:45:02,479 --> 01:45:04,690
It doesn't make
any sense.

1514
01:45:04,773 --> 01:45:07,609
Sometimes they communicate
like that. It gets jumbled.

1515
01:45:08,694 --> 01:45:10,153
The letter "D."

1516
01:45:14,032 --> 01:45:16,368
Dorrie? Dorrie, is it?

1517
01:45:28,630 --> 01:45:30,507
I wanna see...

1518
01:45:30,590 --> 01:45:32,259
Oh, I have to
see her again.

1519
01:45:32,342 --> 01:45:33,552
Whatever it takes.

1520
01:45:33,635 --> 01:45:36,221
- I want you to...
- Uh...

1521
01:45:36,930 --> 01:45:38,306
- Materialize her?
- Yeah.

1522
01:45:39,599 --> 01:45:41,435
Do you have any idea
what would be required

1523
01:45:41,518 --> 01:45:43,103
for something
like that to occur?

1524
01:45:43,186 --> 01:45:47,315
I'll commit $10,000
for every session we have.

1525
01:45:52,112 --> 01:45:53,697
Mr. Grindle.

1526
01:45:56,783 --> 01:45:58,493
Your sins are grave.

1527
01:46:01,079 --> 01:46:02,914
You would have to
work hard,

1528
01:46:03,749 --> 01:46:05,584
spiritually,

1529
01:46:05,667 --> 01:46:09,171
if you even wanna have the
chance to see or sense her.

1530
01:46:09,254 --> 01:46:12,466
Listen, I have more money
than I will ever need.

1531
01:46:12,549 --> 01:46:14,134
But I have no hope.

1532
01:46:14,217 --> 01:46:16,219
And you think
you could buy that?

1533
01:46:17,763 --> 01:46:19,598
Well...

1534
01:46:21,308 --> 01:46:22,809
not to be crude...

1535
01:46:24,102 --> 01:46:26,354
but I know I can.

1536
01:47:09,606 --> 01:47:12,484
Are you sure that she can play
the lady in question?

1537
01:47:13,110 --> 01:47:14,111
Molly?

1538
01:47:16,988 --> 01:47:18,782
She's tougher than I am.

1539
01:47:20,117 --> 01:47:22,202
I'll stage it at night.

1540
01:47:22,285 --> 01:47:24,913
Keep Ezra on his knees,
make him pray or something.

1541
01:47:24,996 --> 01:47:25,956
He'll stay put.

1542
01:47:26,039 --> 01:47:29,000
Blood. She'll need blood
on her hands and dress.

1543
01:47:30,710 --> 01:47:32,796
More shocking the image,

1544
01:47:32,879 --> 01:47:35,257
the less inclined
Ezra will be to examine it.

1545
01:47:48,270 --> 01:47:50,063
Nothing can
hold you back.

1546
01:48:23,805 --> 01:48:25,891
To us.

1547
01:48:34,900 --> 01:48:38,945
"Dear Mom and all,
I'm sending this from the fairgrounds.

1548
01:48:39,029 --> 01:48:41,406
"A boy named Ezra took me.

1549
01:48:41,489 --> 01:48:45,493
"He had my picture taken
as you can see.

1550
01:48:45,577 --> 01:48:50,540
"Tell Pop and all I wish I was with
you and hug little Jennie for me.

1551
01:48:50,624 --> 01:48:53,210
"Will write soon.
Fondly, Dorrie."

1552
01:48:58,340 --> 01:49:00,217
She never mailed this.

1553
01:49:00,300 --> 01:49:01,927
What are you
talking about?

1554
01:49:02,010 --> 01:49:03,220
Well, she died
a few days later.

1555
01:49:03,303 --> 01:49:06,264
This is the last thing she
wrote, and she never mailed it.

1556
01:49:06,348 --> 01:49:08,892
Yeah, but that's not
why I showed it to you.

1557
01:49:08,975 --> 01:49:10,977
Her family never got to see.

1558
01:49:15,774 --> 01:49:18,276
Look.
Who does that look like?

1559
01:49:19,986 --> 01:49:21,279
Look at her face.

1560
01:49:29,579 --> 01:49:30,747
It's you.

1561
01:49:33,208 --> 01:49:35,669
I could materialize you
in a seance.

1562
01:49:40,632 --> 01:49:41,883
Not me, Stan.

1563
01:49:41,967 --> 01:49:44,552
We can buy a costume,
we can get a long black wig,

1564
01:49:44,636 --> 01:49:46,471
and we can cut it,
we can style it just like that.

1565
01:49:46,554 --> 01:49:49,474
He can unburden his soul
and he can forgive himself.

1566
01:49:50,392 --> 01:49:51,476
As far as I can tell,

1567
01:49:51,559 --> 01:49:53,853
that's what a preacher does
every other Sunday.

1568
01:49:55,855 --> 01:49:57,524
And it worked
with Judge Kimball.

1569
01:49:58,817 --> 01:50:01,111
I believe it saved
their marriage.

1570
01:50:02,862 --> 01:50:05,198
I think he really
loved her, Stan.

1571
01:50:07,325 --> 01:50:09,369
You can see that,
can't you?

1572
01:50:10,829 --> 01:50:12,998
All that suffering
that he had,

1573
01:50:14,124 --> 01:50:15,875
we can deliver him
some hope.

1574
01:50:18,670 --> 01:50:20,088
Close it, yeah...

1575
01:50:28,722 --> 01:50:30,432
He wants to see you.

1576
01:50:30,515 --> 01:50:32,392
I'm sure that he does.

1577
01:50:32,475 --> 01:50:34,436
Come on in.
Have a cup of coffee first.

1578
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:37,188
Are you gonna sit out
in the snow?

1579
01:50:39,399 --> 01:50:40,650
I won't bite.

1580
01:50:42,527 --> 01:50:44,029
You take, uh,
cream in your coffee?

1581
01:50:44,988 --> 01:50:46,197
No, thanks.

1582
01:50:46,281 --> 01:50:47,782
Yeah, neither do I.

1583
01:50:51,202 --> 01:50:53,246
I don't know why
he bothers with you.

1584
01:50:54,748 --> 01:50:56,374
You're cheap, pal.

1585
01:50:56,875 --> 01:50:58,293
Just phony.

1586
01:50:59,127 --> 01:51:00,545
But I'll tell you this,

1587
01:51:01,421 --> 01:51:03,131
- I care for that man.
- Mmm.

1588
01:51:03,923 --> 01:51:05,300
I owe him a lot.

1589
01:51:05,967 --> 01:51:07,552
And if you're smart,

1590
01:51:08,553 --> 01:51:09,971
that should scare you.

1591
01:51:16,311 --> 01:51:17,687
She says you...

1592
01:51:18,980 --> 01:51:21,524
lied to her.

1593
01:51:21,608 --> 01:51:24,277
You gave a false name
and you left her body behind.

1594
01:51:26,279 --> 01:51:27,906
Ezra, you have to
keep the circle.

1595
01:51:27,989 --> 01:51:29,407
I wanna see her now,
I wanna talk to her.

1596
01:51:29,491 --> 01:51:31,159
Don't break the circle.
This takes patience.

1597
01:51:31,242 --> 01:51:33,119
I've given you a fortune!

1598
01:51:38,083 --> 01:51:40,001
Now it's time
that you delivered

1599
01:51:41,044 --> 01:51:42,587
to me something
other than guilt.

1600
01:51:42,670 --> 01:51:44,130
Because I'm done hearing

1601
01:51:44,214 --> 01:51:47,467
this endless fucking
recitation of what I did.

1602
01:51:47,550 --> 01:51:49,719
I know what the fuck...

1603
01:51:53,306 --> 01:51:54,599
I did.

1604
01:52:01,981 --> 01:52:05,443
And what I'm going to do
if this goes on much longer.

1605
01:52:05,527 --> 01:52:07,028
- What does that mean?
- Come on.

1606
01:52:07,112 --> 01:52:08,988
You'll just have
to find out.

1607
01:52:14,828 --> 01:52:16,496
You gonna stay here
and practice.

1608
01:52:16,579 --> 01:52:18,915
- Can you ask for more time?
- No.

1609
01:52:18,998 --> 01:52:20,125
I'm not sure
about this, Stan.

1610
01:52:20,208 --> 01:52:22,419
I am sure.
We are out of time.

1611
01:52:22,502 --> 01:52:23,962
Just go put on the wig
and the dress.

1612
01:52:24,045 --> 01:52:25,338
And that's the position.

1613
01:52:25,422 --> 01:52:27,924
Hands down by your side,
with your palms open.

1614
01:52:28,007 --> 01:52:29,592
Okay?

1615
01:52:29,676 --> 01:52:31,678
Where are you going?

1616
01:52:31,761 --> 01:52:33,221
I gotta go get
everything ready.

1617
01:52:33,930 --> 01:52:35,432
I love you.

1618
01:52:56,202 --> 01:52:57,287
Charles.

1619
01:52:58,288 --> 01:53:00,790
I've been thinking about

1620
01:53:00,874 --> 01:53:03,168
what Mr. Carlisle said,

1621
01:53:03,251 --> 01:53:08,256
about us being
reunited with Julian.

1622
01:53:08,339 --> 01:53:09,632
Do you remember?

1623
01:53:10,216 --> 01:53:11,759
I do, my love.

1624
01:53:31,696 --> 01:53:34,908
Oh, Julian.

1625
01:53:34,991 --> 01:53:36,242
Julian.

1626
01:53:42,624 --> 01:53:43,875
Molly?

1627
01:53:54,802 --> 01:53:55,803
<i>Dear Stan.</i>

1628
01:53:56,221 --> 01:53:57,680
Molly?

1629
01:53:57,764 --> 01:54:00,183
<i>By the time you read
this, I'll be eastbound.</i>

1630
01:54:03,102 --> 01:54:05,313
<i>I won't do what
you want me to.</i>

1631
01:54:05,396 --> 01:54:07,315
<i>I can't.</i>

1632
01:54:07,398 --> 01:54:11,194
<i>I've loved you the best I can,
as much as I can,</i>

1633
01:54:11,277 --> 01:54:13,780
<i>and I know now
it'll never be enough.</i>

1634
01:54:18,409 --> 01:54:20,954
<i>Whatever is missing in you,</i>

1635
01:54:21,037 --> 01:54:22,455
<i>it sure is not me.</i>

1636
01:54:24,082 --> 01:54:26,167
<i>It's hard to accept it,</i>

1637
01:54:26,251 --> 01:54:29,045
<i>but as much as
the truth hurts, I need it.</i>

1638
01:54:30,838 --> 01:54:32,799
<i>And maybe in time
you'll need it too.</i>

1639
01:54:34,759 --> 01:54:36,094
<i>Molly.</i>

1640
01:54:36,177 --> 01:54:37,345
Fuck.

1641
01:54:57,282 --> 01:54:58,575
Molly.

1642
01:54:59,117 --> 01:55:00,493
It's me.

1643
01:55:00,577 --> 01:55:02,161
- I thought you already left.
- Leave me alone, Stan.

1644
01:55:02,245 --> 01:55:03,830
- Hold on. Let's just...
- Leave me alone.

1645
01:55:04,872 --> 01:55:06,958
Molly.

1646
01:55:07,041 --> 01:55:08,167
- Where you going?
- I don't wanna talk to you.

1647
01:55:08,251 --> 01:55:09,252
Just hold on one second.

1648
01:55:09,335 --> 01:55:10,336
I read your letter,
I understand.

1649
01:55:10,420 --> 01:55:11,671
I just wanna talk about it
for a second, okay?

1650
01:55:11,754 --> 01:55:13,131
- Oh, you read it? Good.
- Listen...

1651
01:55:13,214 --> 01:55:15,717
You smell like booze.
Leave me alone.

1652
01:55:17,802 --> 01:55:20,555
Molly, you can't leave now,
we are in too deep.

1653
01:55:20,638 --> 01:55:21,639
- Hey, hey!
- Molly.

1654
01:55:21,723 --> 01:55:23,308
There's no
"we" anymore.

1655
01:55:23,391 --> 01:55:24,559
There hasn't been
for a long time.

1656
01:55:24,642 --> 01:55:26,144
I don't know who
you're seeing on the side,

1657
01:55:26,227 --> 01:55:28,521
but you're certainly not
fucking me anymore!

1658
01:55:28,605 --> 01:55:31,399
I bet it's that frozen-faced
bitch you were so impressed with.

1659
01:55:31,482 --> 01:55:33,026
I bet she seems
like class to you.

1660
01:55:33,109 --> 01:55:34,944
Well, she's not
and neither are you.

1661
01:55:35,028 --> 01:55:36,070
Molly.

1662
01:55:37,739 --> 01:55:39,449
Molly, I was just trying to
get the inside track on her

1663
01:55:39,532 --> 01:55:41,242
because you didn't want me
to do the spook show.

1664
01:55:41,326 --> 01:55:42,493
That's why I was
sneaking around on you!

1665
01:55:42,577 --> 01:55:44,579
- Hey, what's the big idea?
- Just mind your own business!

1666
01:55:48,791 --> 01:55:50,710
This is the last time,
I promise.

1667
01:55:50,793 --> 01:55:52,670
And every day
is Christmas after that.

1668
01:55:52,754 --> 01:55:55,131
Oh, sure, the whole world
and everything in it.

1669
01:55:59,093 --> 01:56:00,887
I'm scared, Stan.

1670
01:56:00,970 --> 01:56:02,138
I'm scared,
too, Molly.

1671
01:56:02,221 --> 01:56:03,473
I'm scared every day
of my life.

1672
01:56:05,725 --> 01:56:08,519
I'm so scared sometimes
I can't even breathe.

1673
01:56:08,603 --> 01:56:10,605
But I fight it, Molly,
I fight it.

1674
01:56:10,688 --> 01:56:12,482
That's the only way
I've survived.

1675
01:56:16,527 --> 01:56:18,279
Sometimes you don't see
the line until you cross it.

1676
01:56:18,363 --> 01:56:20,490
I crossed it,
I know that now.

1677
01:56:27,038 --> 01:56:28,498
Molly, everybody's left me
in my life.

1678
01:56:28,581 --> 01:56:30,041
Don't leave me, please.

1679
01:56:36,422 --> 01:56:37,423
Please.

1680
01:57:09,038 --> 01:57:10,248
Can I see your watch?

1681
01:57:18,381 --> 01:57:21,926
When I get rid of Anderson,
I'm gonna bring Ezra to the park bench.

1682
01:57:22,009 --> 01:57:23,386
Just up from
that open gate.

1683
01:57:23,469 --> 01:57:24,637
At 8:00, Molly.

1684
01:57:26,097 --> 01:57:27,473
No earlier, no later.

1685
01:57:27,557 --> 01:57:29,684
You're gonna go through that gate
and you're gonna walk 20 paces.

1686
01:57:30,101 --> 01:57:32,311
Okay?

1687
01:57:32,395 --> 01:57:34,355
When he sees you, I'm gonna
put him on his knees,

1688
01:57:34,439 --> 01:57:36,774
and I'm gonna
make him pray.

1689
01:57:36,858 --> 01:57:38,568
And when
he closes his eyes,

1690
01:57:40,111 --> 01:57:42,113
you get to go away
and then we're done.

1691
01:57:43,614 --> 01:57:45,116
Simple.

1692
01:57:45,199 --> 01:57:46,451
I understand.

1693
01:57:46,534 --> 01:57:47,785
Good.

1694
01:57:48,995 --> 01:57:51,205
Do you remember
the old gag?

1695
01:57:51,289 --> 01:57:53,332
The current, when it would
run through my body?

1696
01:57:53,416 --> 01:57:54,417
Mm-hmm.

1697
01:57:54,500 --> 01:57:56,127
You know how
I could take it?

1698
01:57:57,754 --> 01:58:00,673
First few times I did it,
my muscles would cramp for days.

1699
01:58:00,757 --> 01:58:02,008
It really hurt bad.

1700
01:58:03,718 --> 01:58:07,513
But I'd just try and tell
myself not to feel it, you know?

1701
01:58:07,597 --> 01:58:09,515
Try and make myself
go numb.

1702
01:58:11,434 --> 01:58:15,855
But it was always really clear to
me when I couldn't take it anymore.

1703
01:58:15,938 --> 01:58:17,690
When I'd had enough.

1704
01:58:21,277 --> 01:58:22,820
I've had enough.

1705
01:58:28,534 --> 01:58:30,995
I'll be there at 8:00 and I'll
do what you need me to do.

1706
01:59:09,867 --> 01:59:14,664
Now,
perhaps because of the nature

1707
01:59:14,747 --> 01:59:18,668
of what we're doing tonight,
we'd benefit from being alone.

1708
01:59:22,129 --> 01:59:23,130
Will you leave us?

1709
01:59:23,214 --> 01:59:24,298
Sir, are you sure
about this?

1710
01:59:24,382 --> 01:59:26,342
Yeah, I'm sure. It's fine.

1711
01:59:32,265 --> 01:59:34,267
You have to have faith.

1712
01:59:34,350 --> 01:59:36,185
Let's walk the path.

1713
01:59:51,450 --> 01:59:53,744
<i>In view of Prime
Minister Churchill's recent pledge</i>

1714
01:59:53,828 --> 01:59:55,913
<i>that a British declaration
of war on Japan</i>

1715
01:59:55,997 --> 01:59:58,749
<i>would follow almost immediately
upon the outbreak of war</i>

1716
01:59:58,833 --> 02:00:02,420
<i>between Japan and the United States,
a British announcement is expected soon.</i>

1717
02:00:06,632 --> 02:00:08,759
I place no blame on you

1718
02:00:08,843 --> 02:00:10,928
and I want you
to know that.

1719
02:00:11,012 --> 02:00:13,806
But I think
we should go back inside.

1720
02:00:13,890 --> 02:00:17,602
You asked me
to purge my soul from sin?

1721
02:00:17,685 --> 02:00:18,686
That's right.

1722
02:00:18,769 --> 02:00:19,979
I haven't done that.

1723
02:00:22,440 --> 02:00:23,608
You're gonna do it now.

1724
02:00:23,691 --> 02:00:26,027
You're gonna purge your soul
and invoke her forgiveness.

1725
02:00:26,110 --> 02:00:28,279
I've done things that
I've never told anyone about.

1726
02:00:28,362 --> 02:00:29,363
And you're gonna
tell her now.

1727
02:00:29,447 --> 02:00:31,115
- No, I can't.
- Close your eyes.

1728
02:00:31,198 --> 02:00:32,992
- I can't.
- Be still.

1729
02:00:33,075 --> 02:00:34,702
Don't. Don't make me,
please.

1730
02:00:34,785 --> 02:00:36,037
And tell her.

1731
02:00:39,248 --> 02:00:40,333
Dorrie.

1732
02:00:44,545 --> 02:00:45,546
Dorrie...

1733
02:00:46,839 --> 02:00:48,174
That's it.

1734
02:01:00,186 --> 02:01:02,146
Through the years...

1735
02:01:04,398 --> 02:01:07,026
I have hurt
many young women.

1736
02:01:08,611 --> 02:01:10,321
I don't know why.

1737
02:01:10,947 --> 02:01:12,657
I was seeking...

1738
02:01:12,740 --> 02:01:16,160
I was seeking you in them,

1739
02:01:16,243 --> 02:01:19,246
or I was seeking to rid
my soul of this anger.

1740
02:01:19,330 --> 02:01:22,208
I...
I don't know.

1741
02:01:23,417 --> 02:01:24,543
What did you do?

1742
02:01:25,461 --> 02:01:26,837
I don't know.

1743
02:01:28,506 --> 02:01:29,674
I hurt them.

1744
02:01:32,969 --> 02:01:34,553
I hurt them.

1745
02:01:39,183 --> 02:01:40,226
Dorrie.

1746
02:01:52,947 --> 02:01:55,700
Oh, my God.
She's there.

1747
02:01:56,909 --> 02:01:58,202
She's there.

1748
02:02:02,540 --> 02:02:05,751
<i>This is
WWKB Studios in Buffalo.</i>

1749
02:02:05,835 --> 02:02:09,255
<i>We interrupt this program to
bring you a special news bulletin.</i>

1750
02:02:09,338 --> 02:02:12,174
<i>Judge Charles Kimball
and his wife, Felicia Kimball,</i>

1751
02:02:12,258 --> 02:02:14,010
<i>died today of gunshot wounds.</i>

1752
02:02:14,093 --> 02:02:17,596
<i>An apparent murder-suicide
that has baffled the town.</i>

1753
02:02:17,680 --> 02:02:19,557
Ezra, you did the work.
Now, that's far enough.

1754
02:02:19,640 --> 02:02:21,392
Let's get on our knees,
let's pray with our eyes closed.

1755
02:02:21,475 --> 02:02:22,810
We're gonna ask...

1756
02:02:22,893 --> 02:02:25,187
- Let go of me. Dorrie.
- No, Ezra!

1757
02:02:25,271 --> 02:02:27,565
Dorrie. Oh, Dorrie...

1758
02:02:27,648 --> 02:02:29,984
Stan, I can't.

1759
02:02:30,067 --> 02:02:32,445
- I can't. I can't!
- No, Dorrie!

1760
02:02:32,528 --> 02:02:33,529
Let go!

1761
02:02:38,117 --> 02:02:40,244
Dorrie.

1762
02:02:45,458 --> 02:02:46,709
Sorry.

1763
02:02:49,086 --> 02:02:50,087
What?

1764
02:02:52,131 --> 02:02:54,008
- Who are you?
- All right.

1765
02:02:54,091 --> 02:02:55,885
Now, let go of her hand.

1766
02:02:57,720 --> 02:02:59,096
Who is...

1767
02:03:02,308 --> 02:03:03,601
Let go of her hand.

1768
02:03:03,684 --> 02:03:05,269
You dirty motherfucker.

1769
02:03:05,352 --> 02:03:07,480
You motherfucker.

1770
02:03:08,564 --> 02:03:11,942
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna destroy you.

1771
02:03:12,026 --> 02:03:13,986
You and this bitch!

1772
02:03:14,070 --> 02:03:15,279
Anderson!

1773
02:03:15,362 --> 02:03:17,448
Anderson! Anderson!

1774
02:03:21,202 --> 02:03:22,203
Stan.

1775
02:03:23,120 --> 02:03:24,121
Stan!

1776
02:03:26,415 --> 02:03:27,374
Stan!

1777
02:03:29,210 --> 02:03:30,795
Stan!

1778
02:03:34,590 --> 02:03:36,717
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1779
02:03:41,847 --> 02:03:43,015
Go to the car.

1780
02:03:43,432 --> 02:03:44,433
Now!

1781
02:04:06,705 --> 02:04:08,040
Sir.

1782
02:04:09,333 --> 02:04:10,376
Move over!

1783
02:04:12,378 --> 02:04:13,796
Stan,
what are you doing?

1784
02:04:21,345 --> 02:04:23,097
Oh, God!
What did you do, Stan?

1785
02:04:23,180 --> 02:04:25,224
Why did you do that? Stan!

1786
02:04:25,307 --> 02:04:27,101
Stan! Stan!

1787
02:04:47,913 --> 02:04:49,248
Molly, get out of the car.

1788
02:05:02,595 --> 02:05:05,639
They'll think that, uh,
someone stole the car.

1789
02:05:05,723 --> 02:05:07,183
Can't go back to the hotel.

1790
02:05:09,852 --> 02:05:11,145
Shut up.

1791
02:05:14,315 --> 02:05:15,983
Shut up.

1792
02:05:16,066 --> 02:05:17,651
Molly, they were
trying to kill us.

1793
02:05:21,322 --> 02:05:22,907
Molly.

1794
02:05:29,121 --> 02:05:30,331
Molly!

1795
02:05:36,921 --> 02:05:38,255
I don't need you!

1796
02:05:39,298 --> 02:05:41,133
I don't need you, Molly!

1797
02:05:47,097 --> 02:05:48,682
- Did anyone see you come here?
- No.

1798
02:05:58,067 --> 02:06:00,361
You didn't catch a cab,
did you?

1799
02:06:00,444 --> 02:06:02,905
No, cabbies remember faces.
I walked.

1800
02:06:03,989 --> 02:06:05,950
Ah, she blew it.
That goddamn tomato.

1801
02:06:06,033 --> 02:06:07,868
I was so close.

1802
02:06:13,332 --> 02:06:14,792
It's all here.

1803
02:06:16,919 --> 02:06:17,962
Take it.

1804
02:06:22,007 --> 02:06:23,759
Do you have a few hours?

1805
02:06:24,718 --> 02:06:26,679
Don't panic.

1806
02:06:28,013 --> 02:06:29,515
No.

1807
02:06:29,598 --> 02:06:31,392
I better be on my way.

1808
02:06:34,395 --> 02:06:36,730
Okay.

1809
02:06:40,943 --> 02:06:42,861
Mmm.

1810
02:06:56,375 --> 02:06:58,419
I do love you, Stan.

1811
02:07:15,936 --> 02:07:17,771
What did you say?

1812
02:07:26,447 --> 02:07:28,115
Did I oversell it?

1813
02:07:41,253 --> 02:07:45,716
Patient Stanton Carlisle.
Final therapy session.

1814
02:07:45,799 --> 02:07:47,259
What are you doing?

1815
02:07:56,602 --> 02:07:58,062
They're all singles.

1816
02:08:01,273 --> 02:08:02,232
Where's the dough?

1817
02:08:02,316 --> 02:08:04,485
What are you referring to,
Mr. Carlisle?

1818
02:08:04,568 --> 02:08:06,403
The money!
You took it!

1819
02:08:06,487 --> 02:08:07,529
Try to understand.

1820
02:08:07,613 --> 02:08:10,074
These delusions are becoming
part of your condition.

1821
02:08:10,157 --> 02:08:12,201
You crazy fucking bitch.

1822
02:08:12,284 --> 02:08:14,286
I'll tell them
everything we did.

1823
02:08:14,995 --> 02:08:16,872
Did what? Tell me.

1824
02:08:16,955 --> 02:08:18,582
We did it together.

1825
02:08:19,500 --> 02:08:20,793
I'm sorry, Mr. Carlisle,

1826
02:08:20,876 --> 02:08:24,505
but have we met anywhere
other than this office?

1827
02:08:24,588 --> 02:08:26,215
Cut it out.
What are you doing?

1828
02:08:26,298 --> 02:08:27,424
You came unannounced.

1829
02:08:27,508 --> 02:08:29,718
My secretary
allowed you in.

1830
02:08:29,802 --> 02:08:31,512
I did everything
I could,

1831
02:08:31,595 --> 02:08:34,056
but it seems you've made
a transference to me.

1832
02:08:34,139 --> 02:08:36,934
Both as your mistress
and your mother.

1833
02:08:37,017 --> 02:08:40,062
I had tried to avert
a serious upset.

1834
02:08:40,896 --> 02:08:43,899
It seems that
I have failed.

1835
02:08:43,982 --> 02:08:48,112
The symbolism is quite
obvious, Mr. Carlisle.

1836
02:08:48,195 --> 02:08:51,740
You have a very peculiar
relationship to older men.

1837
02:08:51,824 --> 02:08:54,201
Ezra Grindle,
for example.

1838
02:08:54,284 --> 02:08:57,496
But also the man you claimed
to have killed at the carnival.

1839
02:08:58,664 --> 02:08:59,790
Why?

1840
02:09:02,418 --> 02:09:04,128
Why are you doing this?

1841
02:09:06,422 --> 02:09:08,215
You don't even
care about the money.

1842
02:09:18,308 --> 02:09:20,644
You're such a disappointment.

1843
02:09:22,229 --> 02:09:25,691
No, you're right.
Money doesn't matter to me.

1844
02:09:25,774 --> 02:09:28,318
But it means everything
to you, doesn't it?

1845
02:09:29,570 --> 02:09:32,322
You're a small,
small man.

1846
02:09:33,282 --> 02:09:35,534
You don't fool people,
Stan.

1847
02:09:35,617 --> 02:09:37,578
They fool themselves.

1848
02:09:39,204 --> 02:09:42,916
You think you stand high
above the common man?

1849
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:46,336
You're nothing but an Okie
with straight teeth.

1850
02:09:48,213 --> 02:09:50,340
You think you could
take me, Stan?

1851
02:09:52,134 --> 02:09:54,386
You're so blind,
aren't you?

1852
02:09:55,971 --> 02:09:57,556
You can't read
the signs.

1853
02:09:59,600 --> 02:10:01,643
Didn't you notice
my clutch was heavy?

1854
02:10:08,150 --> 02:10:11,069
Am I powerful enough
for you now, Stan?

1855
02:10:25,167 --> 02:10:27,920
Yes, yes, security.
I need help.

1856
02:10:28,003 --> 02:10:29,087
There's a man.

1857
02:10:29,171 --> 02:10:30,255
A patient of mine.

1858
02:10:30,339 --> 02:10:31,673
Come immediately!

1859
02:10:45,979 --> 02:10:47,523
Come on, Stan.

1860
02:10:47,606 --> 02:10:49,691
You think you can
take my breath away?

1861
02:11:10,462 --> 02:11:11,797
You all right, Doctor?

1862
02:11:14,049 --> 02:11:15,509
I'll live.

1863
02:12:29,166 --> 02:12:30,959
I gotta move it out.

1864
02:12:39,718 --> 02:12:41,345
Okay. Close it!

1865
02:13:20,967 --> 02:13:22,511
I always

1866
02:13:24,596 --> 02:13:25,847
hated you.

1867
02:15:43,819 --> 02:15:47,030
Hey! No more mooching.

1868
02:15:48,615 --> 02:15:53,829
You either pay your suds
or beat it.

1869
02:17:18,914 --> 02:17:20,373
Yes?

1870
02:17:20,457 --> 02:17:22,042
Make it brief, I'm busy.

1871
02:17:25,629 --> 02:17:28,089
Oh, you like that?

1872
02:17:28,173 --> 02:17:30,717
Bought it off an old
ten-in-one that's folded.

1873
02:17:30,800 --> 02:17:32,385
Got the radio, too.

1874
02:17:36,014 --> 02:17:39,059
He killed... He killed...
He killed his mother at birth.

1875
02:17:39,726 --> 02:17:41,019
Enoch.

1876
02:17:41,102 --> 02:17:43,897
Say, that's a nice angle.

1877
02:17:44,564 --> 02:17:45,565
Enoch.

1878
02:17:49,486 --> 02:17:51,029
So, what do you need?

1879
02:17:55,283 --> 02:17:57,327
I would like to apologize
for my appearance.

1880
02:17:57,410 --> 02:18:00,872
I've, uh, fallen onto
some hard times of late.

1881
02:18:00,956 --> 02:18:03,208
But I do have an act

1882
02:18:03,291 --> 02:18:06,378
that I know would be
of great value to you.

1883
02:18:06,461 --> 02:18:08,088
You were a carny, huh?

1884
02:18:08,171 --> 02:18:11,216
Well, I top-lined
a mentalism act for two years.

1885
02:18:11,925 --> 02:18:13,343
Two shows a day.

1886
02:18:13,927 --> 02:18:15,011
Sold out.

1887
02:18:15,095 --> 02:18:17,472
- Oh, mentalism.
- Yes, sir.

1888
02:18:17,555 --> 02:18:18,974
Sorry, brother.

1889
02:18:19,057 --> 02:18:21,226
Some other outfit,
maybe. But not us.

1890
02:18:21,309 --> 02:18:23,311
Well, if I may, I would love
to demonstrate for you.

1891
02:18:23,395 --> 02:18:27,524
Jesus! You smell like
you pissed your pants.

1892
02:18:27,607 --> 02:18:29,943
I don't hire no boozers.
Now beat it.

1893
02:18:31,528 --> 02:18:32,779
Go on, beat it.

1894
02:18:38,159 --> 02:18:41,079
Oh, Christ, wait.
You know what?

1895
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,460
One carny to another,
let's have a snort.

1896
02:18:47,544 --> 02:18:48,753
Come on, sit.

1897
02:18:59,639 --> 02:19:01,641
I don't like mentalism.

1898
02:19:02,350 --> 02:19:04,477
It's too old-timey.

1899
02:19:04,561 --> 02:19:07,063
Always gotta have
something new these days.

1900
02:19:07,772 --> 02:19:09,190
Sensational.

1901
02:19:15,196 --> 02:19:18,324
I just happened
to think of something.

1902
02:19:18,408 --> 02:19:22,620
I might have one job that
you could take a crack at.

1903
02:19:22,704 --> 02:19:26,374
It ain't much and I'm not begging
you to take it, but it's a job.

1904
02:19:27,417 --> 02:19:29,502
It'll keep you
in coffee and cakes.

1905
02:19:29,586 --> 02:19:33,214
Dry place to sleep.
Shot now and then.

1906
02:19:33,298 --> 02:19:37,260
- What do you say?
- Oh, yes, sir.

1907
02:19:37,343 --> 02:19:39,721
It ain't much,
but it's a job, right?

1908
02:19:44,225 --> 02:19:46,269
Of course,
it's only temporary.

1909
02:19:48,480 --> 02:19:51,024
Just until we get
a real geek.

1910
02:19:53,985 --> 02:19:55,570
You know what a geek is?

1911
02:20:00,200 --> 02:20:02,577
So what do you say?

1912
02:20:02,660 --> 02:20:04,329
You think you could
handle it?

1913
02:20:10,710 --> 02:20:11,920
Mister, uh...

1914
02:20:25,809 --> 02:20:27,977
I was born for it.

1915
