1
00:00:45,883 --> 00:00:47,042
Aaahhh!

2
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:51,077
Aaahhh!

3
00:01:13,598 --> 00:01:15,582
Can we start filming?

4
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:16,949
Absolutely doctor.

5
00:01:17,016 --> 00:01:20,607
You see, we’re now in the industrial district, known as chamfor.

6
00:01:20,683 --> 00:01:24,138
The child was so kept in a building in this area.

7
00:01:25,683 --> 00:01:27,515
That's the building there.

8
00:01:28,116 --> 00:01:32,105
We have been given complete authorization to make this film.

9
00:01:32,183 --> 00:01:34,873
To document this case.... for the medical archives.

10
00:01:34,874 --> 00:01:38,076
of assumption hospital pediatric services.

11
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,576
And here we are.

12
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:46,708
This is where she was.

13
00:01:48,816 --> 00:01:51,339
She wasn't never raped, that was certain.

14
00:01:51,449 --> 00:01:55,204
but their is extreme example of child abuse.
This case is classic.

15
00:01:55,205 --> 00:01:57,744
There was starvation, dehydration.

16
00:01:57,849 --> 00:01:59,872
Confined an-hypothermia.

17
00:01:59,949 --> 00:02:04,245
We think this chair was used here to tie her so she can relief herself easily.

18
00:02:04,316 --> 00:02:08,102
From the scars on her wrist we believe she was tied here for days at that time.

19
00:02:08,683 --> 00:02:10,842
But how did she escape?

20
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:13,563
Hahn...Lucie hasn't said a word about what went on here.

21
00:03:05,283 --> 00:03:07,680
Is that orange juice you have?

22
00:03:07,749 --> 00:03:08,874
Is it for her?

23
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:09,998
Mais oui.

24
00:03:11,016 --> 00:03:12,782
You pretending to be her mom?

25
00:03:12,783 --> 00:03:14,546
She doesn't have any mom.

26
00:04:02,749 --> 00:04:07,943
Don't worry now Anna, these Gentlemen are nice men who need your help.

27
00:04:07,944 --> 00:04:09,109
Mm-hmm.
Alright.

28
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:12,915
Do you understand why we showed you that?

29
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:13,848
mm-hmm.

30
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:16,724
So why do you think we need you?

31
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:21,044
Because you wanna get the evil people.

32
00:04:21,148 --> 00:04:23,646
Who did those things to Lucie?

33
00:04:23,647 --> 00:04:25,678
That's right, Anna.

34
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:28,998
Lucie wants that too, you must catch those bad folks.

35
00:04:28,999 --> 00:04:31,761
And what else has she's been telling you about herself?

36
00:04:31,762 --> 00:04:32,378
Nothing more.

37
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:34,710
What else did she say?

38
00:04:34,783 --> 00:04:35,555
Not much more.

39
00:04:35,688 --> 00:04:37,555
What does she remember?

40
00:04:37,582 --> 00:04:42,640
Was doesn't know who did it to her, sometimes she recalls..

41
00:04:42,644 --> 00:04:44,513
...that it’s not real clear.

42
00:04:45,016 --> 00:04:47,547
And you? What do you think?

43
00:04:47,548 --> 00:04:49,349
Think she remembers anything?

44
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:53,015
They kept really dark... she could barely see him.

45
00:04:53,016 --> 00:04:56,004
- She doesn't remember.
- Alright.

46
00:04:57,016 --> 00:04:58,565
Come in.

47
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:05,278
Lucie jurin didn't come down for lunch.

48
00:05:17,549 --> 00:05:18,879
Lucie?

49
00:05:36,382 --> 00:05:38,541
Oh...Anna.

50
00:05:40,683 --> 00:05:41,774
Anna.

51
00:05:43,883 --> 00:05:45,246
Please don't tell.

52
00:05:46,116 --> 00:05:48,604
Don't do this again.

53
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:49,239
It wasn't me.

54
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:54,872
I didn't do this.
It wasn't me.

55
00:05:54,649 --> 00:05:56,513
Calm down.

56
00:06:11,482 --> 00:06:13,710
Want to sleep with me?

57
00:06:53,349 --> 00:06:55,508
Anna?

58
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:22,103
15 years later

59
00:08:45,549 --> 00:08:46,810
Aah!

60
00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:51,080
Give it to me!
Give that!

61
00:08:52,582 --> 00:08:53,809
Ohh!

62
00:08:53,883 --> 00:08:57,280
You two, that’s enough!

63
00:08:58,516 --> 00:08:59,607
Shit!

64
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:02,717
Your girlfriend can't barely write a sentence!

65
00:09:03,757 --> 00:09:04,784
Shut up!

66
00:09:04,785 --> 00:09:06,909
Stop it.

67
00:09:06,982 --> 00:09:09,450

Yupp.

76
00:09:52,716 --> 00:09:54,765
What's she say?

77
00:09:54,766 --> 00:09:56,382
She is more pissed about our low water pressure.

78
00:09:56,383 --> 00:10:00,210
Uhhh..she's not happy, with the either situation.

79
00:10:00,211 --> 00:10:01,974
- Are you happy?
- what? ..what?

80
00:10:02,049 --> 00:10:03,208

84
00:10:10,683 --> 00:10:11,478
A present from your plumber.

85
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:13,481
Oh, shit, Gabrielle!

86
00:10:13,482 --> 00:10:15,277
That's really gross.

87
00:10:15,349 --> 00:10:18,110
It found me in our water main.

88
00:10:18,111 --> 00:10:20,315
This guy was causing our low water pressure.

89
00:10:20,316 --> 00:10:23,424
- Mom!!
- We're eating, dump it in the trash.

90
00:10:23,716 --> 00:10:24,804
Yuck come on!

91
00:10:25,282 --> 00:10:28,544
At least now its fixed that now we can replant the area.

92
00:10:29,649 --> 00:10:32,697
So did Antoine tell you his great plan?

93
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:34,786
Actually.. I was just asking him what you have thought of it.

94
00:10:34,787 --> 00:10:37,781
No, I told she wasn't happy about it.

95
00:10:37,782 --> 00:10:39,448
Try minding your own business, Be quite.

96
00:10:39,449 --> 00:10:40,779
I wanna help him.

97
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:42,915
You can't help a brother who has a visionary.
that’s for sure.

98
00:10:43,616 --> 00:10:44,907
Antoine?

99
00:10:44,908 --> 00:10:49,515
So now we'll expensive school to drop back of after only being there for three months.

00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:51,715
- We already paid the whole years tution.
- Tada!

101
00:10:51,716 --> 00:10:53,443
Marry you really need to butt out!

102
00:10:53,516 --> 00:10:54,778
She thinks she's a swimming celebrity.

103
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:58,281
- You planning to make this a habit of yours?
- This school?

104
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:01,648
Keep in mind you wouldn't graduated if we hadn't paid extra for tutoring.

105
00:11:01,649 --> 00:11:04,556
- You barely made it.
- What do you mean i made it?

106
00:11:04,557 --> 00:11:08,605
Oh the see average? Come on..wouldn't mind you was about a grand push you through...wasn't it?

107
00:11:08,683 --> 00:11:09,608
Extra each semester?

108
00:11:09,609 --> 00:11:12,181
But it’s no skin off your nose, was it?

109
00:11:12,182 --> 00:11:14,978
Aren't you tired of being, such a pain in the ass.

110
00:11:14,982 --> 00:11:17,843
Well listen! This school's a lot more work.

111
00:11:17,848 --> 00:11:21,178
I want to go study something i really like.

112
00:11:21,249 --> 00:11:22,647
Just get your law degree.

113
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:26,203
Law! But studying law isn't my thing.

114
00:11:26,282 --> 00:11:28,648
- Well law opens many door.
- The real problem is....

115
00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:31,214
...that he wants to live with his girlfriend, Minerva!

116
00:11:31,215 --> 00:11:32,647
But you know law's not my thing.

117
00:11:32,648 --> 00:11:35,381
What's just crap is if anything is your thing..

118
00:11:35,382 --> 00:11:39,542

Aaahhh!

132
00:14:19,815 --> 00:14:22,372
How could you do that to me?

133
00:14:25,982 --> 00:14:29,670
How the hell could you do it.
Why?

134
00:14:37,215 --> 00:14:39,046
Why?

135
00:15:20,581 --> 00:15:22,411
- It's them.

136
00:15:22,412 --> 00:15:24,539
- It's them, Anna.

137
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,081

00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:33,944

00:15:35,848 --> 00:15:37,746
- You did what?
- What i had to do.

144
00:15:37,815 --> 00:15:41,009
- We said you just observe them.
- I am sure, they were the once.

145
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:43,348
I knew i should've come with you.

146
00:15:43,349 --> 00:15:45,008
Don't you believe me?

147
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:49,593
Where are you calling from?

148
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:52,217
- From the house.
- From their house?

149
00:15:52,249 --> 00:15:53,476
Yaa.

150
00:15:53,548 --> 00:15:55,447
What's the address there.

151
00:15:57,882 --> 00:15:59,348
Give me the address!

152
00:18:07,515 --> 00:18:08,674

It's me. Lucie, It's me, calm down.
It's me.

00:21:31,648 --> 00:21:33,697
She's here.

158
00:21:40,248 --> 00:21:44,045
- She's in the house.
- I know, I know.

159
00:21:44,115 --> 00:21:46,604
She cuts me up worse, then usual!

160
00:22:00,515 --> 00:22:02,004
Now you stay here.

161
00:22:02,082 --> 00:22:03,672
Where you going?

163
00:22:06,815 --> 00:22:08,804
- Listen to me.
- Please be careful.

00:22:09,149 --> 00:22:12,808
I have to look.
You wait here, don't move.

165
00:23:19,948 --> 00:23:21,106
Anna?

166
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:28,847
She hurt me worse than usual.

I'm coming Lucie.

168
00:23:33,248 --> 00:23:34,942
What should I do?

169
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:38,841
I'm almost done.

170
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:24,080
- Got more sharp then showers.
- They are gone.

171
00:24:24,081 --> 00:24:25,377
- Maybe we should keep moving?
- Yaah.

172
00:24:25,448 --> 00:24:27,038
She'll be back soon.

173
00:24:27,615 --> 00:24:28,842
Come on.

174
00:24:29,782 --> 00:24:33,908
They are gonna know that we did this.
Because you phone me from here.

175
00:24:34,982 --> 00:24:36,545
I don't care.

176
00:24:36,545 --> 00:24:37,545
I know.

177
00:24:38,546 --> 00:24:39,447
Really I don't.

178
00:24:39,448 --> 00:24:41,880
You care if they lock you up.

179
00:24:48,515 --> 00:24:51,276
- What should we do?
- Stay still.

180
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:55,290
- You are hurting me.
- Sorry.

181
00:24:57,915 --> 00:24:59,999
Now, what will we do?

182
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:42,308
You okay?

183
00:25:47,515 --> 00:25:50,071
Does this make you any sick?

184
00:25:53,515 --> 00:25:55,071
Can you smell that smell?

185
00:25:55,648 --> 00:25:57,213
Smells awful hah?

186
00:25:57,214 --> 00:25:59,840
Every time she bent over me.
I smell that.

187
00:25:59,915 --> 00:26:03,073
Every day, understand?

188
00:26:03,682 --> 00:26:07,204
And it smells different when she'd beat me.

189
00:26:15,081 --> 00:26:17,138
Look.

190
00:26:18,815 --> 00:26:21,371
It's them.

191
00:26:54,748 --> 00:26:56,077
What are you doing?

192
00:27:04,181 --> 00:27:06,738
Will we ever be free from this?

193
00:27:09,148 --> 00:27:11,977
Yaah, sure.

194
00:29:00,281 --> 00:29:04,270
Aaahhh!

195
00:29:13,415 --> 00:29:14,676
Anna?

196
00:29:19,515 --> 00:29:21,741
Anna?

197
00:29:23,814 --> 00:29:25,075
Anna?

198
00:29:31,148 --> 00:29:34,941
Please, if you wanna live.
Be quite.

199
00:29:41,981 --> 00:29:42,938
What you doing?

200
00:29:45,481 --> 00:29:47,037
- You okay?
- Yeah.

201
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:49,847
- You didn't answer.
- I didn't hear you.

202
00:29:49,848 --> 00:29:51,344
- I thought she was here.
- No.

203
00:29:51,345 --> 00:29:53,945
You finished?
Then let's go?

204
00:29:53,946 --> 00:29:55,514
Not yet, let's cleanup.

205
00:29:55,515 --> 00:29:57,878
- When we done, we go?
- Yehh, get dressed.

206
00:30:28,515 --> 00:30:29,741
Aaahhh!

207
00:30:29,814 --> 00:30:31,712
Aaahhh!

208
00:30:33,448 --> 00:30:36,209
- Aaahhh!
- Lucie?

209
00:30:36,281 --> 00:30:38,769
Aaahhh!

210
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:52,239
Lucie?

211
00:31:05,714 --> 00:31:08,171
- Open the door.
- I can't, it's locked.

212
00:31:08,681 --> 00:31:09,772
Open up.

213
00:31:38,415 --> 00:31:39,641
Hurry!

214
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:48,163
No!

215
00:31:51,515 --> 00:31:53,105
What do you want?

216
00:31:53,106 --> 00:31:54,877
Stop what you doing!

217
00:31:54,878 --> 00:31:57,136
Those are among dead.

218
00:31:58,381 --> 00:32:00,903
I murdered them all.

219
00:32:00,904 --> 00:32:03,708
I killed both the kids as well.

220
00:32:19,081 --> 00:32:22,638
Calm down, come on.

221
00:34:16,415 --> 00:34:20,582
You little slut.
Don't go in there!

222
00:34:21,881 --> 00:34:23,177
I kill you!

223
00:34:47,747 --> 00:34:49,796
Forgive me.

224
00:34:50,647 --> 00:34:52,511
It's not my fault.

225
00:35:29,647 --> 00:35:30,696
Anna?

226
00:35:38,248 --> 00:35:39,406
Anna?

227
00:35:42,248 --> 00:35:43,297
Anna?

228
00:35:45,747 --> 00:35:47,576
Anna!

229
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:51,508
Where are you?

230
00:35:56,814 --> 00:35:58,803
Anna!

231
00:36:01,048 --> 00:36:04,479
Anna, I know you're there.
Now let me out,

232
00:36:07,947 --> 00:36:09,572
I'm coming.

233
00:36:26,281 --> 00:36:27,406
What's your name?

234
00:36:28,014 --> 00:36:29,207
Gabrielle.

235
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:32,712
I'm coming, Lucie.

236
00:36:33,448 --> 00:36:34,946
Gabrielle, you got to help me.

237
00:36:34,947 --> 00:36:37,413
Why did she do this?

238
00:36:41,181 --> 00:36:42,669
Aah!

239
00:36:55,014 --> 00:36:56,639
I think she heard us.

240
00:36:59,347 --> 00:37:01,841
You all right?
Come on!

241
00:37:08,248 --> 00:37:09,645
We have to hurry.

242
00:37:23,614 --> 00:37:25,739
God I can't run.

243
00:37:25,814 --> 00:37:27,246
Go for my children.

244
00:37:28,514 --> 00:37:29,246
Help me.

245
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:33,654
I'll take you as far as the woods.
Then you're on your own.

246
00:37:35,814 --> 00:37:37,178
Don't do it!

247
00:37:40,814 --> 00:37:41,905
Don't... Lucie!

248
00:38:15,981 --> 00:38:17,879
What made you wanna help her?

249
00:38:19,248 --> 00:38:20,446
She didn't do anything.

250
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,673
She was the one who hurt me.

251
00:38:22,674 --> 00:38:23,713
A lot!

252
00:38:29,847 --> 00:38:31,506
And you want her to live?

253
00:38:58,014 --> 00:38:59,639
So you never believe me.

254
00:39:00,147 --> 00:39:01,510
Enough.

255
00:39:03,147 --> 00:39:06,774
So you believe I'm insane too.
just like the doctors.

256
00:39:10,248 --> 00:39:13,839
Did they ever do anything for me.
besides say I was crazy?

257
00:39:13,914 --> 00:39:15,379
You're like them.

258
00:39:22,547 --> 00:39:23,843
It's over... Anna.

259
00:39:39,914 --> 00:39:41,345
They're all dead.

260
00:39:41,413 --> 00:39:43,709
They won't hurt you anymore.

261
00:40:37,747 --> 00:40:39,645
Aaahhh!

262
00:40:59,814 --> 00:41:01,404
Aaahhh!

263
00:41:02,181 --> 00:41:03,737
Lucie!

264
00:41:09,447 --> 00:41:10,496
Lucie!

265
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,010
Lucie!

266
00:42:15,147 --> 00:42:16,373
Come back!

267
00:42:18,147 --> 00:42:20,010
No!

268
00:42:57,213 --> 00:43:00,543
No! No!

269
00:43:05,347 --> 00:43:08,313
No! No!

270
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:31,510
Why are you calling, hah?

271
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:35,508
I don't hear from you for over two years
and now you call?

272
00:44:35,601 --> 00:44:36,346
Yes.

273
00:44:36,413 --> 00:44:38,811
I'm not go to lie.
I'm furious with you.

274
00:44:38,881 --> 00:44:40,244
Mamma...

275
00:44:40,313 --> 00:44:42,575
Did you call to make me feel guilty?

276
00:44:42,647 --> 00:44:44,272
No.

277
00:44:44,347 --> 00:44:46,045
You think I don't still feel bad?

278
00:44:46,046 --> 00:44:51,312
Think I'm not still wait down by the shit duely I raised you. Where you went down. hah?

279
00:44:51,413 --> 00:44:53,276
No..mamma that's not it.

280
00:44:53,347 --> 00:44:54,574
Then what is it?

281
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,173
I just called my mother. talk to you, for real.

282
00:44:58,247 --> 00:45:02,009
So you woke up today and decided you miss your mamma?

283
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:04,945
Anna, you're okay? you are not in trouble Anna?

284
00:45:05,013 --> 00:45:06,104
No.

285
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:08,112
So where are you?

286
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:09,837
Pretty far away.

287
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,576
So do you have a place? where do you live?

288
00:45:14,647 --> 00:45:17,112
- I'm fine mamma.
- So tell me.

289
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:19,578
- Are you still with her?
- No.

290
00:45:19,647 --> 00:45:23,346
You're lying, she still running your life.
I can tell.

291
00:45:23,347 --> 00:45:23,995
Mamma!

292
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,658
She's crazy, she is insane bitch.

293
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:31,379
Looser, what you see in her arm never know.

294
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:33,238
You need to break free from that bitch.

295
00:45:33,847 --> 00:45:34,996
Anna?

296
00:45:35,881 --> 00:45:37,039
Are you there?

297
00:45:38,081 --> 00:45:39,573
Hello?

298
00:45:40,347 --> 00:45:41,596
Anna?

299
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:47,344
Stay here.

300
00:51:04,713 --> 00:51:06,475
I can't help you.

301
00:51:35,113 --> 00:51:36,874
Just calm down... shh.

302
00:52:21,932 --> 00:52:24,012
Aaahhh!

303
00:52:31,146 --> 00:52:34,271
Aaahhh!

304
00:52:34,347 --> 00:52:36,210
Aah!

305
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:47,505
Shh.... it's off now.

306
00:52:52,447 --> 00:52:54,140
Shhhh.

307
00:52:56,579 --> 00:52:57,909
Just rest.

308
00:53:25,579 --> 00:53:26,806
Forgive me.

309
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:33,240
I'm so sorry.

310
00:54:34,613 --> 00:54:36,045
Stop it!

311
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:36,439
Who's the girl on the couch?

312
00:55:37,013 --> 00:55:38,410
Who is she?

313
00:55:39,479 --> 00:55:40,809
Lucie.

314
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,037
Lucie. who?

315
00:55:42,512 --> 00:55:43,944
Lucie jurin.

316
00:55:44,013 --> 00:55:45,410
And you?

317
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,939
You are?

318
00:55:49,013 --> 00:55:50,438
Anna assaoui.

319
00:55:50,539 --> 00:55:54,012
We've been trying to calling
to the phone here for hours.

320
00:55:54,013 --> 00:55:55,343
The phone was off the hook.

321
00:55:55,412 --> 00:55:57,276
This shouldn't never happened.

322
00:55:57,346 --> 00:56:00,142
Can you tell me what went on here?

323
00:56:02,813 --> 00:56:04,472
What are you doing here?

324
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,973
Lucie jurin actually escaped from us
15 years ago.

325
00:58:43,479 --> 00:58:44,570
Correct?

326
00:58:45,679 --> 00:58:46,728
Right.

327
00:58:46,946 --> 00:58:51,402
Back then, we were not quite assure.
We were disorganized.

328
00:58:51,403 --> 00:58:53,636
Gabrielle never should have let her escape.

329
00:58:53,644 --> 00:58:55,914
After 15 years, the child found her.

330
00:58:55,915 --> 00:59:00,345
I was impressed by her junasity as for the rest.

331
00:59:00,346 --> 00:59:01,995
Lucie is just a victim.

332
00:59:03,579 --> 00:59:05,568
Like all of the others.

333
00:59:05,813 --> 00:59:10,939
It is so easy to create a victim.
young lady, so easy.

334
00:59:11,013 --> 00:59:13,979
You lock someone in a room with no light.

335
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:16,272
Soon they begin to suffer.

336
00:59:16,346 --> 00:59:18,812
Then you feed that suffering.

337
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,505
Slowly methodically.

338
00:59:20,579 --> 00:59:23,409
Systematically, coldly.

339
00:59:23,479 --> 00:59:25,105
For a long time.

340
00:59:25,279 --> 00:59:30,007
You then witness your subject,
going through several mental states.

341
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:33,671
The mental trauma starts to break them.

342
00:59:33,746 --> 00:59:36,678
And that small, easily opened crack.

343
00:59:36,746 --> 00:59:40,838
Makes them see things,
that don't exist in our world.

344
00:59:40,913 --> 00:59:44,170
Your friend Lucie.
What was her vision? Hmm

345
00:59:45,746 --> 00:59:47,575
Did she see any thing?

346
00:59:47,946 --> 00:59:50,605
Not even one monster?

347
00:59:50,898 --> 00:59:53,937
Did she see things
that wanted to hurt her?

348
00:59:54,013 --> 00:59:55,342
Hmm?

349
00:59:55,746 --> 00:59:57,795
A dead girl.

350
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,573
I knew it.

351
01:00:00,646 --> 01:00:01,695
A dead girl.

352
01:00:01,696 --> 01:00:06,045
The one that you found, sarah dutreuil,
saws up the insects.

353
01:00:06,046 --> 01:00:07,673
Scrawling all over her skin.

354
01:00:07,674 --> 01:00:10,887
She'd rather cut off her own arm
than living with that fear.

355
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:14,178
People ignored the existence of suffering.

356
01:00:16,479 --> 01:00:18,274
That's how our world sees it.

357
01:00:19,179 --> 01:00:21,372
Yet everyone's a victim.

358
01:00:22,546 --> 01:00:25,137
Martyrs are very rare.

359
01:00:26,279 --> 01:00:30,074
A true martyr is a special person.

360
01:00:30,145 --> 01:00:31,509
They are exceptional beings.

361
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:36,045
They been sent paralyzing pain young lady.
They can survive total deprivation.

362
01:00:36,046 --> 01:00:39,239
They carry all the sins of the world.

363
01:00:39,312 --> 01:00:41,437
It's their sacrifice.

364
01:00:41,438 --> 01:00:43,278
They transcend themselves completely.

365
01:00:43,279 --> 01:00:45,108
Do you understand?

366
01:00:45,179 --> 01:00:47,009

She stole a hen,
But it cost her dearly.

370
01:01:00,771 --> 01:01:03,478
In the photograph you can see,
She's still very alive.

371
01:01:03,479 --> 01:01:05,445
Look at her eyes.

372

..didn't care for that, so she had to pay.

375
01:01:16,346 --> 01:01:18,073
Look at her eyes.

376
01:01:18,145 --> 01:01:19,771
She was still alive.

377
01:01:20,145 --> 01:01:23,578
1960, A hospital in birmingham.

378
01:01:23,579 --> 01:01:28,879
Just an ordinary young housewife.
An atheist, riddle with terminal cancer.

379
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:31,505
Morphine had lost his effect for her.

380
01:01:31,579 --> 01:01:32,778
Her eyes tell the story.

381
01:01:32,846 --> 01:01:36,938
Beaten with a pipe by her jealous husband.
After his release from prison.

382

01:01:52,646 --> 01:01:56,078
Each one of them was still alive.
When they were photographed.

389
01:01:56,145 --> 01:01:58,739
No one can try to tell me that the concept of martyrdom

390
01:01:58,740 --> 01:02:01,276
was strictly an invention of the religious.

391
01:02:01,277 --> 01:02:03,971
We tried everything, even with children.

392
01:02:04,045 --> 01:02:06,807
And we proven that its women.

393
01:02:07,079 --> 01:02:10,910
That are much more responsive to transfiguration.

394
01:02:11,546 --> 01:02:14,136
Yes...young women.

395
01:02:15,412 --> 01:02:16,776
That's how it is.

396
01:03:37,846 --> 01:03:39,004

Aaaaahhhhh!

01:03:54,579 --> 01:03:56,511
Aaahhh!

401
01:04:02,312 --> 01:04:05,574
Aaahhh!

402
01:04:05,646 --> 01:04:08,168

Anna?

405
01:17:06,245 --> 01:17:08,041
Are you there?

406
01:17:08,511 --> 01:17:10,841
Anna? I'm here.

407
01:17:10,912 --> 01:17:12,507
Yes, Lucie?

408
01:17:12,879 --> 01:17:14,936
Why aren't you never scared?

409
01:17:15,012 --> 01:17:17,107
I am scared sometimes.

410
01:17:17,879 --> 01:17:18,504
Not like I'm.

411
01:17:18,578 --> 01:17:21,567
I didn't go through what you did.

412
01:17:22,311 --> 01:17:24,641
How do you stop being scared?

413
01:17:25,712 --> 01:17:27,678
Just let go.

414
01:17:27,812 --> 01:17:29,175
You think so?

415
01:17:29,245 --> 01:17:31,711
Just let go.

416
01:17:32,178 --> 01:17:35,371
And if i can't, will you be there?

417
01:17:35,372 --> 01:17:35,877

01:17:35,945 --> 01:17:37,501
I miss you.

419
01:19:13,612 --> 01:19:15,202
You're not scared now.

420
01:19:22,145 --> 01:19:23,974
Not scared now.

421
01:19:29,045 --> 01:19:30,136
Not scared now.

422
01:20:02,412 --> 01:20:04,071
You'll be all right.

423
01:20:04,145 --> 01:20:05,703
Your suffering is almost over.

424
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:09,002
There's only one more stage.

425
01:20:11,345 --> 01:20:13,038
The last one.

426
01:20:14,111 --> 01:20:15,441
You'll be all right.

427
01:20:16,412 --> 01:20:20,344
You won't have to protect yourself ever again.

428
01:20:20,412 --> 01:20:21,809
It's okay.

429
01:24:03,644 --> 01:24:06,471
- Is she still holding up?
- That's amazing.

430
01:24:40,978 --> 01:24:42,239
Michel!

431
01:24:42,311 --> 01:24:44,174
What's going on?

432
01:24:44,245 --> 01:24:46,753
Michel..Come quickly.

433
01:24:53,245 --> 01:24:55,733
Just now, when I went down to feed her.

434
01:24:55,734 --> 01:24:59,277
- Are you certain?
- Mam, I couldn't been more certain.

435
01:24:59,278 --> 01:25:01,073
I have never seen such an expression.

436
01:25:01,145 --> 01:25:05,009
She's like god, she's completely like god.
Her face is like something.

437
01:25:05,078 --> 01:25:06,374
Mam, it's like.

438
01:25:06,444 --> 01:25:10,343
Her eyes, I swear, she no longer sees anything around her.

439
01:25:10,411 --> 01:25:11,809
But is she still...

440
01:25:11,878 --> 01:25:15,140
Yes! She's alive,
Mam, certain she is.

441
01:27:55,844 --> 01:27:57,605
Have you seen it then?

442
01:28:01,577 --> 01:28:03,838
The other world?

443
01:29:35,577 --> 01:29:36,510
Yesterday afternoon.

444
01:29:36,511 --> 01:29:38,500
In this very house.

445
01:29:38,501 --> 01:29:41,407
At around 12:15.

446
01:29:41,408 --> 01:29:44,670
Anna assaoui became a martyred.

447
01:29:45,310 --> 01:29:49,004
Let us take a moment to pay our respect.

448
01:29:49,577 --> 01:29:52,270
Anna assaoui is a rare individual.

449
01:29:52,271 --> 01:29:54,742
In our 17 years of research.

450
01:29:54,743 --> 01:29:58,140
Anna is only the fourth person to have attained that stage.

451
01:29:58,141 --> 01:30:00,608
And the first.
Yes, my friends.

452
01:30:00,609 --> 01:30:05,269
The first one to have reported
what she has seen then.

453
01:30:05,270 --> 01:30:08,733
Between 12:15 and 2:30 p.m.

454
01:30:08,734 --> 01:30:12,934
Miss Anna assaoui saw beyond death into the other world.

455
01:30:12,944 --> 01:30:16,210
You heard me correctly.
Her state of ecstasy..

456
01:30:16,211 --> 01:30:18,971
..lasted two hours and 15 minutes.

457
01:30:18,972 --> 01:30:21,476
This was not a near-death experience.

458
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:24,305
There is no doubt that our martyrdom was authentic.

459
01:30:24,306 --> 01:30:27,610
At 2:30 p.m...She came out of this state.

460
01:30:27,611 --> 01:30:29,009
At 3:05.

461
01:30:29,077 --> 01:30:30,668
On a spoke.

462
01:30:30,744 --> 01:30:32,334
At this moment.

463
01:30:32,411 --> 01:30:34,168
She is still alive.

464
01:30:34,169 --> 01:30:36,101
Although no longer communicating.

465
01:30:36,177 --> 01:30:39,643
Mademoiselle heard her full testimony.

466
01:30:40,001 --> 01:30:42,735
And my friends, this testimony.

467
01:30:42,811 --> 01:30:46,029
will be shared with you in just a few moments.

468
01:30:55,978 --> 01:30:57,702
Mademoiselle.

469
01:30:58,177 --> 01:30:59,541
They're waiting.

470
01:31:00,177 --> 01:31:02,137
Very well Etienne.

471
01:31:07,844 --> 01:31:09,833
She really told you?

472
01:31:09,911 --> 01:31:11,968
Of course.

473
01:31:13,344 --> 01:31:14,674
Was it clear?

474
01:31:17,278 --> 01:31:18,941
Like crystal.

475
01:31:20,110 --> 01:31:21,599
And precise?

476
01:31:23,477 --> 01:31:27,043
I can see no other Interpretation, Etienne.

477
01:31:29,611 --> 01:31:31,968
I see, Mademoiselle.

478
01:31:38,577 --> 01:31:39,770
Etienne?

479
01:31:42,844 --> 01:31:44,503
Mademoiselle?

480
01:31:45,210 --> 01:31:48,735
Have you ever tried to imagine the other world?

481
01:31:49,277 --> 01:31:50,943
Everything all right?

482
01:31:53,277 --> 01:31:56,505
- Well have you?
- I'm afraid not.

483
01:31:57,978 --> 01:32:00,307
Keep doubting Etienne.

484
01:32:07,644 --> 01:32:15,407
Martyr: Noun.
From the Greek "Martyr's"

485
01:32:15,477 --> 01:32:19,466
