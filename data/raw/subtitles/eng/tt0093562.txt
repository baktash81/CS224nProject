1
00:00:02,583 --> 00:00:05,042
(bright music)

2
00:00:26,917 --> 00:00:31,917
(man gasping)
(melancholy music)

3
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:24,542
(dramatic music)

4
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,292
- Billy!

5
00:01:49,292 --> 00:01:50,292
Billy.

6
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:55,958
Billy.

7
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:07,250
(train whooshing)

8
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:13,958
- [Passenger] Shut the
door, (indistinct).

9
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,958
(train whistles)

10
00:03:23,167 --> 00:03:25,750
(steam hissing)

11
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:19,250
(brakes squeaking)

12
00:04:24,292 --> 00:04:26,333
- [Conductor] Oxgodby!

13
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,417
- You've gotta be
rearin' soaked.

14
00:04:37,417 --> 00:04:39,917
Right down to the
skin, they say.

15
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,375
- Ticket please!

16
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:10,000
Hey, you can borrow me
umbrella if thou wants.

17
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,250
- What?

18
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,458
- I said you can
borrow me umbrella.

19
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:15,375
- Oh, that's all right.

20
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,417
I'm not going far.

21
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:20,250
- Cup of tea then,
in the station house?

22
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,208
- Thank you, but I
have an appointment.

23
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:25,417
- Aye, I know.

24
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,375
You've come to the
church, haven't ya?

25
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:31,125
Well, if you don't find what
you're looking for there,

26
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,792
come and see us
other lot at chapel.

27
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,250
- Thank you.

28
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,958
(rain pattering)

29
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:00,625
Bugger it!

30
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:08,125
(thunder rumbling)

31
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:57,375
(dramatic music)

32
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,208
- What were you doing?

33
00:08:07,292 --> 00:08:09,208
Just now, outside?

34
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:14,208
- Oh, checking the rain
gutters, the downpipes.

35
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:17,792
- Why?

36
00:08:17,792 --> 00:08:18,458
- Because if they were no

37
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:21,625
good, there would've
been no point

38
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:22,917
in my bothering to come in.

39
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:28,042
It would have been
destroyed, you see?

40
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,458
- Oh, well, if you'd
waited to ask me,

41
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:35,333
I could've told you they're
all functioning perfectly.

42
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:38,625
You could've saved
yourself a run in the rain.

43
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,167
I'm Keach, by the way.

44
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,417
Reverend J. G. Keach.

45
00:08:57,542 --> 00:08:58,708
It was I who wrote you.

46
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:02,625
If you're Mr. Birkin, that is.

47
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,625
I take it you are.

48
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:05,417
- Yes.

49
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:17,208
- At what time did
you leave London?

50
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:22,667
- 11 o'clock.

51
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,917
- I see that in your anxiety
to check the gutters,

52
00:09:26,917 --> 00:09:29,250
you didn't take time to
drop your things off?

53
00:09:34,667 --> 00:09:36,792
Where do you intend to stay?

54
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:37,958
- Well I thought here.

55
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:44,208
- Here?

56
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,083
Where here?

57
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,500
- What about the belfry?

58
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,667
- The belfry?

59
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,667
I can't say that appeals to me,

60
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:58,708
having somebody
live in the belfry.

61
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,750
Shouldn't you take lodgings,
a room in the Shepherd's Arms.

62
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,750
- I'm a bit short, you see?

63
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,875
- Oh, I see.

64
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,125
Well then, in that case.

65
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,667
But I should warn
you that ropes pass

66
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:14,292
through the belfry floor
when Mossop rings them.

67
00:10:18,542 --> 00:10:19,583
- I don't mind.

68
00:10:22,042 --> 00:10:23,208
- Very well then.

69
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,625
What period is it
supposed to be,

70
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,917
the mural, the wall painting?

71
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:57,708
- Oh, I would guess about
1430 or something like that.

72
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:00,667
The survivors avoided hellfire

73
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:04,167
by donating wall
paintings to churches.

74
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,417
It's impossible to say
for sure but of course

75
00:11:10,417 --> 00:11:13,625
'til I've uncovered some of it.

76
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,792
- In any case about 1430.

77
00:11:17,792 --> 00:11:19,792
We shan't entertain any extras.

78
00:11:19,792 --> 00:11:20,708
- There won't be any.

79
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,417
- There mustn't be any.

80
00:11:22,417 --> 00:11:24,750
Now you've agreed a
fee of 25 guineas,

81
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,542
12 pounds, 10 shillings
to be paid halfway

82
00:11:27,542 --> 00:11:29,500
and 13 pound 15
shillings when finished

83
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,375
and approved by the executives.

84
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:32,167
- Not by you?

85
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:36,417
- Miss Hebron omitted my name

86
00:11:36,417 --> 00:11:37,875
from the form requested,

87
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:41,500
an oversight, of course, but
to all intents and purposes,

88
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,667
I represent the executives.

89
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:43,792
You answer to them through me.

90
00:11:43,792 --> 00:11:46,625
I shan't mind if
you touch it up.

91
00:11:47,792 --> 00:11:48,958
- Touch it up?

92
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,708
- Well, it's faded.

93
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:53,417
You can fill them in as
long as it's appropriate.

94
00:11:53,417 --> 00:11:54,625
Turns in with the rest.

95
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,583
- Turns in with the rest?

96
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:58,542
Of course it isn't
absolutely sure

97
00:11:58,542 --> 00:11:59,833
that there's anything there.

98
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:00,833
- Of course there's
something there.

99
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:03,167
Mr. Birkin, you should
know here and now

100
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:06,917
that your employment here
does not have my support,

101
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,833
but as the solicitors
refused to pay out

102
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:12,667
her 1000 pound request
to our fabric fund

103
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:17,250
until your job is
finished, I have no choice.

104
00:12:19,042 --> 00:12:20,292
When the painting is uncovered,

105
00:12:20,292 --> 00:12:23,042
it will be in full view
of the congregation.

106
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:24,542
It'll distract from worship.

107
00:12:25,917 --> 00:12:28,833
- After a time, they
won't notice it.

108
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,583
- It'll distract.

109
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,750
Well, Mr. Birkin,
I shall leave you

110
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,458
to settle into your quarters.

111
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,833
Good night.

112
00:13:02,792 --> 00:13:05,750
(dramatic music)

113
00:13:50,792 --> 00:13:51,583
- Oxgodby.

114
00:14:16,292 --> 00:14:18,917
(man gasping)

115
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:59,250
(birds chirping)

116
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:54,000
(wood thudding)

117
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:54,000
(reverent music)

118
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:34,250
(door creaks)

119
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,042
- Morning.

120
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,917
Hi, good morning, James Moon.

121
00:17:37,917 --> 00:17:39,958
I'm chap in the bell tent.

122
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,458
It's in the field opposite.

123
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:42,792
I meant to let you settle in

124
00:17:42,792 --> 00:17:44,708
but I felt I had to come
and have a look at you.

125
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,000
Well, it's partly that,

126
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,417
but really 'cause I get
so stiff in the night,

127
00:17:47,417 --> 00:17:49,333
my legs force me up.

128
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,958
That's how I stumble
across most mornings

129
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:54,167
to see if Leticia's managed
to climb out during the night.

130
00:17:54,167 --> 00:17:55,792
Well, I mean, you
never know, do you?

131
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:01,500
Oh, most loving and
delightful wife.

132
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,000
I could never make out if
that was grief or relief.

133
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,042
Do you mind if I
come up for a moment?

134
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,750
I won't if you
think I'm invading.

135
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:19,875
- Come up.

136
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,042
- Good.

137
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:40,958
So, you think that's
something there, eh?

138
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,000
- [Tom] I hope so.

139
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,042
- Go with it by hope.

140
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,042
What do you think you'll find?

141
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:49,208
- Judgment, I expect.

142
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:50,417
- Ah, yes, yes, a judgment.

143
00:18:50,417 --> 00:18:52,708
Yes, that's what it
would be, wouldn't it?

144
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:54,583
- The judgements always
got the plum spot

145
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,125
so the whole parish
could see the

146
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:04,167
God awful things that
would happen to 'em

147
00:19:04,167 --> 00:19:07,208
if they didn't fork
out their tithes

148
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:11,958
and marry the girls
they got with child.

149
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:20,042
- St. Michael waves over,
Christ in majesty reverie,

150
00:19:20,042 --> 00:19:22,833
and down below the fire,
the flame, of evermore, eh?

151
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:28,542
Look, why don't you come over

152
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:29,792
and have a cup of
tea before you start?

153
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,125
Come on, you got
the whole summer.

154
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,250
Spin out the anticipation
another half an hour,

155
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,042
why don't you?

156
00:19:39,667 --> 00:19:40,458
Come on.

157
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,208
So officially I'm
looking for the grave

158
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,042
of Miss Hebron's forbearer,

159
00:19:48,042 --> 00:19:50,833
one Piers Hebron, born 1373.

160
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:52,333
He was excommunicated,

161
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,125
buried somewhere
outside the graveyard

162
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,625
so all I have to do is spend
three or four weeks digging

163
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,708
for his bones and if
I can't find him...

164
00:19:57,708 --> 00:20:00,500
- You'll have wasted your time.

165
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,875
- Wasted my time?

166
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:04,458
Good God, man, can't you see?

167
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,542
I'm not here for Piers' bones.

168
00:20:06,542 --> 00:20:08,917
I'm here for a major discovery.

169
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,417
We're standing on a basilica.

170
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:13,583
Saxon chapel, probably
goes back to 600.

171
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,333
I've already come across a
couple of cremation jars.

172
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,167
There must be hundreds of them.

173
00:20:17,167 --> 00:20:18,833
Oh, you'll keep quiet
about it though, won't you?

174
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,917
I didn't want anyone to
tumble to what I'm up to

175
00:20:20,917 --> 00:20:23,292
until I've got all I
want and written it up.

176
00:20:23,292 --> 00:20:28,042
- So you're doing one job
and being paid for another?

177
00:20:28,042 --> 00:20:29,083
- Well, that's right.

178
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:30,417
Why not, if it's
money well spent?

179
00:20:30,417 --> 00:20:31,792
And I'll leave some time to prod

180
00:20:31,792 --> 00:20:34,167
around for Piers's
bones before I go.

181
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:35,667
I'll find them, don't you worry.

182
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:38,958
Oh whoops!

183
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:39,708
Whoops!

184
00:20:48,542 --> 00:20:51,208
You were over there too.

185
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:54,125
That's where you developed
your twitch and stammer.

186
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,458
(melancholy music)

187
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:58,542
Well, I developed a great
affection for holes.

188
00:21:01,417 --> 00:21:02,583
They make me feel safe.

189
00:21:12,292 --> 00:21:13,792
And they keep me insulated.

190
00:21:40,167 --> 00:21:41,125
Here, have a look at this.

191
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:43,042
It's my latest cremation jar.

192
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:49,333
- Moon.

193
00:21:50,292 --> 00:21:52,542
- Morning, Colonel,
morning, Mossop.

194
00:21:52,542 --> 00:21:54,542
The Colonel is Miss
Hebron's brother.

195
00:21:54,542 --> 00:21:56,125
Mossop looks after the church.

196
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,375
This is Mr. Birkin who's
come to uncover the painting.

197
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:00,708
- Ah, good.

198
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:01,458
Well done.

199
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,542
And what about you,
Moon, making progress?

200
00:22:04,542 --> 00:22:06,667
Any sign of old
Piers' bones yet?

201
00:22:07,792 --> 00:22:09,250
- Not yet, Colonel.

202
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,792
- Found anything
out of the ordinary?

203
00:22:11,792 --> 00:22:13,292
Gold or silver?

204
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:15,500
Jugs and jars, et cetera?

205
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:17,625
- Well, I wish I had.

206
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,333
- Press on, let me know.

207
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,667
Stay as long as you like.

208
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:28,167
Care to umpire for
us on Saturdays?

209
00:22:28,167 --> 00:22:30,042
Mossop here says he
can't manage any longer

210
00:22:30,042 --> 00:22:31,250
on account of his legs.

211
00:22:33,792 --> 00:22:37,833
Well, would've liked
to lodge up with you.

212
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:40,250
Another morning, perhaps.

213
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:42,167
I shall be on my way.

214
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:48,292
Things to do.

215
00:22:48,292 --> 00:22:50,625
So, Mossop, there's your
umpiring taken care of.

216
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:51,375
Very similar.

217
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:58,458
- Thou found summat then?

218
00:22:58,458 --> 00:23:01,375
- Oh, just the usual
artifacts, Mossop.

219
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:04,292
(birds chirping)

220
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,458
(men laughing)

221
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:18,417
There.

222
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:25,333
(reverent music)

223
00:25:13,542 --> 00:25:16,333
- Yes, well he isn't out
of the usual catalog is he?

224
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:19,458
He's a real wintry hard
liner, your Christ.

225
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:21,083
All justice and no mercy.

226
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,125
I wouldn't fancy being in
the dock if he was the beat.

227
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:28,750
And he shall come
with the woundes red

228
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,667
to damn the quick and the dead.

229
00:25:38,542 --> 00:25:41,250
(bells clanging)

230
00:25:53,417 --> 00:25:56,708
- Now hear the words of Jesus

231
00:25:56,708 --> 00:25:59,792
to lead us and
encourage us in prayer.

232
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,500
Then shall the King say
unto them on his right hand,

233
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,375
come ye blessed of my father,

234
00:26:07,375 --> 00:26:10,583
inherit the kingdom prepared
for you from the foundation

235
00:26:10,583 --> 00:26:11,375
of the world

236
00:26:12,625 --> 00:26:16,000
for I was anhungered
and He gave me meat.

237
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,917
I was thirsty and
He gave me drink.

238
00:26:20,458 --> 00:26:24,917
I was a stranger and He took
me in naked and He clothed me.

239
00:26:27,375 --> 00:26:30,417
I was sick and He visited me.

240
00:26:30,417 --> 00:26:32,583
I was in prison.

241
00:26:32,583 --> 00:26:33,500
- Look behind you, Keach.

242
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,500
- [Keach] He came unto me.

243
00:26:35,542 --> 00:26:37,125
- That's what you're praying to.

244
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:38,458
- [Keach] Then shall the
righteous answer Him saying-

245
00:26:38,458 --> 00:26:40,542
- He doesn't want your prayers.

246
00:26:40,542 --> 00:26:42,250
He wants some answers.

247
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,000
Did you feed the hungry, hm?

248
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,500
- [Keach] And thirsty
and gave me drink.

249
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,250
- [Tom] Did you give
drink to the thirsty?

250
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,833
- [Keach] I say unto you,
come ye blessed of my father.

251
00:26:50,833 --> 00:26:53,500
- [Tom] Did you clothe
the naked and needy?

252
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,458
- [Keach] Have the
kingdom prepared for you.

253
00:26:55,458 --> 00:26:56,542
- What about me, eh?

254
00:26:57,583 --> 00:26:59,083
Any of you offer
me bed and board?

255
00:26:59,083 --> 00:27:02,500
- [Keach] Stranger and
took thee in, all naked-

256
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,375
- Smug Yorkshire lot.

257
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:09,042
I'll have a word with him about
the way you've treated me.

258
00:27:09,042 --> 00:27:10,583
He'll get you yet.

259
00:27:11,708 --> 00:27:13,792
- The King shall answer
and say unto them,

260
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,833
verily, I say unto you,

261
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:17,458
in as much as ye
have done it unto one

262
00:27:17,458 --> 00:27:19,500
of the least of
these, my brethren,

263
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:22,292
you have done it unto me.

264
00:27:33,792 --> 00:27:36,000
- Hello there, Mr. Birkin.

265
00:27:38,917 --> 00:27:39,708
- Hello.

266
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:45,083
- I'm Kathy Ellerbeck and
this me brother, Edgar.

267
00:27:45,083 --> 00:27:46,708
Our dad's station master.

268
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:48,167
We brought you rabbit pie

269
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,000
'cause Mum says you
need nourishment.

270
00:27:51,458 --> 00:27:52,917
- Thank you.

271
00:27:52,917 --> 00:27:54,708
- Our dad said you must be
miserable workin' all day

272
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:56,292
on your own up there

273
00:27:56,292 --> 00:27:59,250
so he said we could play
you some records, didn't he?

274
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,667
- Can we come up now?

275
00:28:00,667 --> 00:28:03,500
- Sorry no one's allowed up.

276
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,500
That's an absolute rule.

277
00:28:06,792 --> 00:28:08,250
- What about Mr. Moon?

278
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,917
Mr. Mossop said you let him up?

279
00:28:09,917 --> 00:28:12,458
- Well, we have a
reciprocal agreement.

280
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:14,917
He looks at my work
and I look at his.

281
00:28:14,917 --> 00:28:17,458
- Can we stay down here then?

282
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:20,083
- As long as you don't mind
my turning my back on you.

283
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:25,958
(bright music)

284
00:28:25,958 --> 00:28:26,917
Why do you want to?

285
00:28:28,042 --> 00:28:29,500
- Me dad says you're
an opportunity

286
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,500
that might not come again
in a little spot like this.

287
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,333
Watching an artist at work.

288
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:36,542
- I'm not an artist.

289
00:28:36,542 --> 00:28:39,708
I'm just a laborer who
cleans up after artists.

290
00:28:39,708 --> 00:28:41,833
- We have a picture
painted on our chapel wall,

291
00:28:41,833 --> 00:28:44,292
behind the pulpit.

292
00:28:44,292 --> 00:28:45,750
- Three big (indistinct) lilies.

293
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,708
It's very beautiful.

294
00:28:47,708 --> 00:28:48,625
- [Tom] Why?

295
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:50,333
- Why what?

296
00:28:50,333 --> 00:28:51,250
- Why lilies?

297
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,542
Why just lilies?

298
00:28:52,542 --> 00:28:57,458
I mean, why not lilies
and roses or just roses.

299
00:28:57,458 --> 00:29:00,958
Or roses and daisies?

300
00:29:02,167 --> 00:29:04,583
- 'Cause around it, it
says conceded lilies

301
00:29:04,583 --> 00:29:05,667
in official lettering.

302
00:29:05,667 --> 00:29:07,250
It's a text.

303
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:10,917
Consider lilies, how they
grow, they toil not, you know?

304
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:14,542
- Well, why couldn't they
look at roses or daisies?

305
00:29:14,542 --> 00:29:15,542
- Oh, I don't know.

306
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,917
(crickets chirping)

307
00:29:33,917 --> 00:29:35,167
- Oh, this is very nice.

308
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:41,167
From the station
master's wife, eh?

309
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,708
- Her children brought it.

310
00:29:47,958 --> 00:29:50,625
- And what has the Reverend
J.G. Keach brought you?

311
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:53,167
- Nothing.

312
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,292
- No money yet?

313
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:03,125
Oh, by the way you said
something the other day

314
00:30:03,125 --> 00:30:04,750
about longing for a woodbine.

315
00:30:05,708 --> 00:30:07,833
Well look what I
dug up this morning.

316
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,292
- Thanks.

317
00:30:15,667 --> 00:30:16,708
- Well.

318
00:30:23,833 --> 00:30:25,750
I shall see you anon.

319
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:32,667
(peaceful music)

320
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,625
- [Alice] Oh, I'm
sorry, did I wake you?

321
00:32:02,792 --> 00:32:06,500
- That depends on
whether I'm awake or not.

322
00:32:13,458 --> 00:32:14,917
You been here long?

323
00:32:16,042 --> 00:32:18,542
- Maybe 10 minutes,
I'm not sure.

324
00:32:18,542 --> 00:32:19,792
I'm Alice Keach.

325
00:32:19,792 --> 00:32:21,958
I just came to find
out if you're all right

326
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:24,042
in the bell loft or if
there's anything you needed.

327
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:28,500
It seems so inhospitable, you
up there on the floorboards

328
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,042
and we in our beds.

329
00:32:30,042 --> 00:32:31,667
We've got to traveling rug.

330
00:32:31,667 --> 00:32:33,292
- No, I'm all right.

331
00:32:33,292 --> 00:32:35,125
At the end of the day, I'm so
tired I sleep sleep like the

332
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:39,833
dead.

333
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:41,667
And during the
day sometimes too.

334
00:32:43,833 --> 00:32:44,625
- Oh, well.

335
00:32:47,083 --> 00:32:49,792
(James shouting)

336
00:32:53,917 --> 00:32:55,833
- He's working off his cramp.

337
00:32:55,833 --> 00:32:56,833
- Oh.

338
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,750
The painting, when will we
be able to see all of it.

339
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:03,667
- Well, I don't know.

340
00:33:03,667 --> 00:33:04,750
It's a bit like a jigsaw.

341
00:33:06,208 --> 00:33:08,833
A face, a shoe here
a bit, there a bit.

342
00:33:09,958 --> 00:33:11,417
Comes together very slowly.

343
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:17,500
If it comes together at all.

344
00:33:18,167 --> 00:33:19,708
And of course after

345
00:33:23,375 --> 00:33:24,750
500 years I can't be sure.

346
00:33:27,458 --> 00:33:29,125
- But that's the
exciting part, isn't it?

347
00:33:29,125 --> 00:33:30,958
Not knowing what's
around the corner.

348
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:34,458
Like opening a
parcel at Christmas.

349
00:33:35,667 --> 00:33:37,250
So you must let me see it.

350
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:41,917
Anyway, I'll haunt you
a little until you do.

351
00:33:43,958 --> 00:33:48,833
- You related to the Reverend
J.G. Keach, the vicar?

352
00:33:49,917 --> 00:33:51,167
- Yes, I'm his wife.

353
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:55,250
(peaceful music)

354
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,042
- [James] Mrs. Keach.

355
00:33:56,042 --> 00:33:56,792
- [Alice] Mr. Moon.

356
00:34:06,917 --> 00:34:08,000
- She's a stunner, isn't she?

357
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,083
- Is she?

358
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:10,625
- Of course she is!

359
00:34:10,625 --> 00:34:11,417
And you know it.

360
00:34:11,417 --> 00:34:13,167
Come on, admit you do.

361
00:34:13,167 --> 00:34:14,000
- Oh, I admit it.

362
00:34:16,625 --> 00:34:18,208
Perhaps she wouldn't.

363
00:34:18,208 --> 00:34:19,500
Perhaps she doesn't
even know it.

364
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,500
- Rubbish, every woman
knows if she's beautiful

365
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,000
and imagine Keach catching
her of all people.

366
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:28,250
You're married too, aren't you?

367
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:33,792
- Sort of.

368
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:38,292
She went off another chap.

369
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:42,208
Not for the first time.

370
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:45,417
Can't say I blame her really.

371
00:34:48,167 --> 00:34:49,000
Her name's Finny.

372
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:54,583
- Yes, thought it might
be something like that.

373
00:34:54,583 --> 00:34:57,792
As for me, never really
met the right woman.

374
00:35:00,958 --> 00:35:02,000
Luckily for her.

375
00:35:14,458 --> 00:35:16,958
(bright music)

376
00:35:41,542 --> 00:35:45,167
- That's all for
today, Mr. Birkin.

377
00:35:45,167 --> 00:35:45,958
- Right.

378
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:50,958
- Mum and Dad say you got
to come to dinner on Sunday.

379
00:35:50,958 --> 00:35:52,292
- What?

380
00:35:52,292 --> 00:35:55,208
- You're coming to
dinner on Sunday.

381
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,917
- Oh, thank you.

382
00:36:01,083 --> 00:36:03,792
- Mr. Douthwaite'll be
coming and all, blacksmith.

383
00:36:03,792 --> 00:36:05,875
Comes most Sundays.

384
00:36:05,875 --> 00:36:07,375
- Right, well, thank you.

385
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:09,000
Oh, what time?

386
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,792
- 11 o'clock, of course.

387
00:36:10,792 --> 00:36:11,708
- [Tom] 11 o'clock?

388
00:36:11,708 --> 00:36:13,500
- Yeah, chapel, it starts at 11.

389
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
- Brethren and fellow
sinners, yea sinners!

390
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:38,875
I say sinners for are we
all not here unto sinners.

391
00:36:40,292 --> 00:36:43,125
Is there one amongst you here

392
00:36:43,125 --> 00:36:47,042
who can say he is not a sinner?

393
00:36:47,042 --> 00:36:48,167
Is there?

394
00:36:49,458 --> 00:36:54,250
If so, I challenge him to
come forward and speak.

395
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:06,375
- Lord, well, what
it boils down to Lord

396
00:37:06,375 --> 00:37:08,583
is that we'd like to
accept with thanks

397
00:37:09,958 --> 00:37:13,042
and we'd like you to
know that as we sit down

398
00:37:13,042 --> 00:37:15,750
to dinner today, we all eat

399
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:20,750
with great loving
heart and gratitude

400
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:23,417
for we know Lord
that without thee,

401
00:37:23,417 --> 00:37:25,417
we wouldn't have a dinner.

402
00:37:25,417 --> 00:37:29,208
And furthermore, we wouldn't
be here in first place.

403
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:41,958
- My father was a
butcher, Mr. Birkin.

404
00:37:46,792 --> 00:37:49,458
(birds chirping)

405
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,625
(man snoring)

406
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:15,208
(bell chiming)

407
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,792
(train whooshing)

408
00:38:28,042 --> 00:38:31,000
(whistle tweets)

409
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:40,917
- It's Balatton Ferry for
me this afternoon, Mother.

410
00:38:40,917 --> 00:38:42,250
- Does it have to be you?

411
00:38:43,167 --> 00:38:44,708
But you're tired out.

412
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:48,833
You should be lying down,
not doing that long walk

413
00:38:48,833 --> 00:38:49,833
in the sun.

414
00:38:51,167 --> 00:38:53,208
- Last time you went,
you came back all faint.

415
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:54,250
Didn't he, Mum?

416
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,167
- Yea, I'd do it for thee, Jack,

417
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,042
thou knows but I
promised to teach Bible

418
00:38:58,042 --> 00:38:59,792
at Grimsley Sunday School.

419
00:38:59,792 --> 00:39:02,208
- No, it's all right, George.

420
00:39:03,292 --> 00:39:04,292
I'll manage.

421
00:39:06,458 --> 00:39:07,708
- Mr. Birkin here'll go for ya.

422
00:39:07,708 --> 00:39:08,875
Won't ya, Mr. Birkin?

423
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,792
- What?

424
00:39:12,292 --> 00:39:13,417
Go where?

425
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:14,333
- We'll show ya.

426
00:39:15,583 --> 00:39:17,167
- Well, what do ya say?

427
00:39:17,167 --> 00:39:19,458
- Well, there's no denying
that Mr. Birkin's legs

428
00:39:19,458 --> 00:39:20,583
are younger than mine.

429
00:39:22,083 --> 00:39:25,000
- You wouldn't mind going,
would you Mr. Birkin?

430
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,792
- To do what?

431
00:39:26,667 --> 00:39:28,042
- Just a bit of preaching.

432
00:39:30,083 --> 00:39:34,958
- I've never
preached in my life.

433
00:39:34,958 --> 00:39:36,583
- Well, you heard
me this morning.

434
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:40,208
Just do that.

435
00:39:40,208 --> 00:39:41,417
- Yes.

436
00:39:41,417 --> 00:39:43,208
Just do what Dad does.

437
00:39:45,833 --> 00:39:48,500
(people singing)

438
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:20,375
- Brethren.

439
00:40:23,208 --> 00:40:25,958
And fellow sinners.

440
00:40:28,208 --> 00:40:32,375
My sermon today derives.

441
00:40:33,542 --> 00:40:34,292
Derives.

442
00:40:38,417 --> 00:40:41,208
(kids giggling)

443
00:40:42,542 --> 00:40:45,958
Look here, I only came in
place of Mr. Ellerbeck today

444
00:40:45,958 --> 00:40:46,708
because he's-

445
00:40:48,792 --> 00:40:50,292
He's indisposed.

446
00:40:51,708 --> 00:40:52,500
I can't preach.

447
00:40:54,167 --> 00:40:58,583
So all I can do is tell you
about what I'm up to in Oxgodby

448
00:40:58,583 --> 00:41:00,083
in the church there.

449
00:41:02,458 --> 00:41:03,958
And if you want to
leave or nod off,

450
00:41:03,958 --> 00:41:05,208
then that's all right by me.

451
00:41:07,708 --> 00:41:10,208
Well, I'm cleaning the wall,

452
00:41:11,417 --> 00:41:14,708
the one above the nave
because behind the dirt

453
00:41:14,708 --> 00:41:19,375
and the layers of paint,
there's a picture.

454
00:41:22,417 --> 00:41:24,833
So there I am, you see,
up on my scaffolding

455
00:41:24,833 --> 00:41:27,625
scraping away until I get
back to the picture itself.

456
00:41:29,333 --> 00:41:32,042
It's really all patience,
you see, my sort of work.

457
00:41:33,417 --> 00:41:35,292
But I don't get
any second chances.

458
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:37,375
That's what makes
it so exciting.

459
00:41:38,583 --> 00:41:40,542
One dab too few
and some poor chap

460
00:41:40,542 --> 00:41:42,500
won't get back from
five centuries ago,

461
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:47,167
one dab too many and
wiped him out forever.

462
00:41:50,792 --> 00:41:52,917
Makes me sound rather
like God, doesn't it?

463
00:41:57,125 --> 00:42:02,000
Well, really I'm just a
servant like every one of us

464
00:42:03,125 --> 00:42:04,083
except I'm the servant
of the painter.

465
00:42:07,333 --> 00:42:11,000
I hope I'm good enough
to serve this painter

466
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,250
because he deserves the
very best of servants.

467
00:42:16,625 --> 00:42:19,250
(dog barking)

468
00:42:29,375 --> 00:42:31,750
- You from London
are ya, Mr. Birkin?

469
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:32,542
- Yes.

470
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:37,292
London, that's right.

471
00:42:40,833 --> 00:42:42,583
- We've never met
a Londoner before.

472
00:42:44,042 --> 00:42:45,458
- You're the first, Mr. Birkin.

473
00:42:46,667 --> 00:42:47,458
- Oh.

474
00:42:51,417 --> 00:42:52,500
- You were over there, were you?

475
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,042
Mr. Birkin, in France.

476
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:02,625
- So was our Perc.

477
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:08,375
He had it taken on his last
leave, on his 19th birthday.

478
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:14,000
- He was a right good lad, Perc.

479
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:16,333
Real worker.

480
00:43:17,292 --> 00:43:18,667
He'd give hand to anybody.

481
00:43:21,083 --> 00:43:22,083
Everybody liked him.

482
00:43:33,333 --> 00:43:36,708
Well, would you like to look
at the farm, Mr. Birkin?

483
00:43:36,708 --> 00:43:40,292
- Yes, Lucy, why don't you
show Mr. Birkin round the farm?

484
00:43:40,292 --> 00:43:42,417
- Would you like to see around?

485
00:43:42,417 --> 00:43:44,083
- We can't.

486
00:43:44,083 --> 00:43:45,792
We've gotta visit Emily Clough.

487
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:47,000
We promised her.

488
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,333
And we told our
Sunday school teacher

489
00:43:48,333 --> 00:43:50,042
we'd take her her star card.

490
00:43:51,583 --> 00:43:52,500
- Emily Clough?

491
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,667
- We said we'd bring you at all.

492
00:43:53,667 --> 00:43:55,375
She's expecting ya, innit she?

493
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:57,750
- Aye.

494
00:44:00,917 --> 00:44:02,542
- Oh, well perhaps
another Sunday.

495
00:44:06,708 --> 00:44:09,167
(cow moos)

496
00:44:09,167 --> 00:44:11,958
(wings whooshing)

497
00:44:16,208 --> 00:44:18,875
(birds tweeting)

498
00:44:31,333 --> 00:44:33,417
(chickens clucking)

499
00:44:33,417 --> 00:44:34,500
- [Kathy] Mrs.
Clough, we've come

500
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,417
to bring Emily some flowers.

501
00:44:36,417 --> 00:44:37,667
- Go on up.

502
00:44:37,667 --> 00:44:39,583
On the way out you
can have a jam tart.

503
00:44:40,833 --> 00:44:43,542
(shoes thudding)

504
00:44:54,167 --> 00:44:56,542
- I brought ya your
star card, Emily.

505
00:44:56,542 --> 00:44:59,000
Mr. Douthwaite
stamped it S for sick.

506
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,458
He says count so many stars.

507
00:45:01,792 --> 00:45:04,333
You only need six more
stars for a prize.

508
00:45:06,417 --> 00:45:08,125
- Oh, S is for sick.

509
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:13,750
- I've been thinking
about my prize.

510
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:15,375
I'd like "Forgotten Garden".

511
00:45:16,458 --> 00:45:17,708
What are you two having?

512
00:45:18,958 --> 00:45:20,500
- "Pearl Island"
and Edgar's having

513
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,625
"The Children of
the New Forest".

514
00:45:22,625 --> 00:45:24,333
- Isn't that a bit beyond him?

515
00:45:24,333 --> 00:45:25,625
- He'll grow to like it later.

516
00:45:25,625 --> 00:45:28,708
I've heard it's a good
story with two girls in it.

517
00:45:28,708 --> 00:45:32,125
Mr. Birkin's the man
livin' in church, Emily.

518
00:45:32,125 --> 00:45:33,500
- Oh, I've heard about you.

519
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:36,125
I hope you'll still be there
when I'm up, Mr. Birkin.

520
00:45:39,667 --> 00:45:41,000
I like your straw hat, Kathy.

521
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:41,833
Can I try it on?

522
00:45:49,625 --> 00:45:52,583
(Emily coughing)

523
00:45:59,792 --> 00:46:02,458
(birds chirping)

524
00:46:02,458 --> 00:46:04,917
(bright music)

525
00:46:06,417 --> 00:46:08,625
- [Kathy] She knows
she's dyin', don't she?

526
00:46:14,917 --> 00:46:16,500
- [Ellerbeck] Hello Kathy.

527
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,583
Is Mr. Birkin here as good
as your dad at the preaching?

528
00:46:18,583 --> 00:46:21,000
- Well, he didn't
really do no preaching.

529
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,458
Just talked about his
painting, didn't he?

530
00:46:23,458 --> 00:46:24,500
- He did and all.

531
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:29,500
- You feeling all
right, Mr. Birkin?

532
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,125
You've hardly touched your tea.

533
00:46:31,125 --> 00:46:33,500
- [Kathy] He had his tea at
Lucy Sykes', (indistinct).

534
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:38,208
- [Mrs. Ellerbeck] She's a
fine strong girl is Lucy Sykes.

535
00:46:38,208 --> 00:46:41,500
- [Ellerbeck] That's right,
good Christian upbringing too.

536
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:42,542
- [Mrs. Ellerbeck]
Time we asked her

537
00:46:42,542 --> 00:46:45,458
to the Sunday School
outing, eh Father?

538
00:46:45,458 --> 00:46:48,500
- Aye, aye, I
meant to last year.

539
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:52,000
- Please excuse me.

540
00:46:53,292 --> 00:46:54,708
I must get back.

541
00:46:59,417 --> 00:47:00,875
- It's that Lucy Sykes.

542
00:47:00,875 --> 00:47:03,417
He's been funny ever
since he saw her.

543
00:47:03,417 --> 00:47:06,125
(reverent music)

544
00:47:19,208 --> 00:47:20,625
- God, what God?

545
00:47:21,917 --> 00:47:23,833
There is no God!

546
00:47:23,833 --> 00:47:26,542
(birds chirping)

547
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:01,458
(James shouting)

548
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:12,750
(James crying)

549
00:48:48,583 --> 00:48:50,917
- [Tom] I don't really want
"Roses of Picardy" this morning

550
00:48:50,917 --> 00:48:51,833
if you don't mind.

551
00:48:53,417 --> 00:48:56,292
- Well, will you accept
my traveling rug?

552
00:48:56,292 --> 00:48:57,083
- Oh.

553
00:48:59,833 --> 00:49:01,333
Sorry, I thought you
were someone else.

554
00:49:01,333 --> 00:49:04,625
- Yes, I know Kathy Ellerbeck
and that gramophone.

555
00:49:04,625 --> 00:49:06,667
Now you'll have
to let me come up.

556
00:49:06,667 --> 00:49:07,583
That was our agreement.

557
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,333
May I?

558
00:49:11,417 --> 00:49:14,208
Mr. Moon was saying that he
was sure you wouldn't let me.

559
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:19,875
You wanted to keep
it all to yourself.

560
00:49:49,625 --> 00:49:51,292
But this is horrible.

561
00:49:52,667 --> 00:49:53,708
It's horrible.

562
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:56,750
It's it's like a sort of hell.

563
00:49:58,625 --> 00:50:01,292
- It's probably not so
horrible if you believed in it.

564
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:05,417
- Do you believe in it?

565
00:50:07,792 --> 00:50:09,292
- When I look at it
when I'm working on it,

566
00:50:09,292 --> 00:50:10,625
I believe in his belief.

567
00:50:12,667 --> 00:50:14,333
It's impossible not to, really.

568
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,500
- But otherwise you don't
believe there's a hell?

569
00:50:20,792 --> 00:50:22,125
- Well, I suppose hell
means different things

570
00:50:22,125 --> 00:50:23,125
to different people.

571
00:50:29,375 --> 00:50:31,667
- What does it mean to you?

572
00:50:32,667 --> 00:50:33,708
- Hell on earth, I think?

573
00:50:36,583 --> 00:50:37,542
- Yes, of course.

574
00:50:40,375 --> 00:50:43,333
Although I don't
really understand.

575
00:50:43,333 --> 00:50:44,833
How could I?

576
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:45,917
- [Tom] Why should you?

577
00:50:47,375 --> 00:50:48,750
- Well, I suppose
one should try.

578
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:50,667
- No you shouldn't,
I'd rather you didn't.

579
00:50:57,792 --> 00:51:02,417
- Were you always in the
cleaning business, Mr. Birkin?

580
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:09,625
- My father traveling

581
00:51:11,958 --> 00:51:12,750
soap.

582
00:51:40,375 --> 00:51:41,375
- Thank you.

583
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:44,917
For letting me see.

584
00:51:50,833 --> 00:51:53,458
(peaceful music)

585
00:53:35,958 --> 00:53:38,708
(bell ringing)

586
00:54:04,292 --> 00:54:05,083
Hello.

587
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:14,417
- I came to see your
husband but he isn't-

588
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:16,083
- Oh, he wouldn't
be able to hear you.

589
00:54:16,083 --> 00:54:18,292
He's playing right at
the end of the house.

590
00:54:19,292 --> 00:54:22,792
(peaceful violin music)

591
00:54:28,917 --> 00:54:32,125
You haven't been
here before have you?

592
00:54:32,125 --> 00:54:34,292
We have it all to ourselves.

593
00:54:35,833 --> 00:54:40,083
Most of the rooms are empty,
you see, completely empty.

594
00:54:40,083 --> 00:54:41,875
This one and this one.

595
00:54:49,667 --> 00:54:51,542
It can be quite oppressive.

596
00:54:51,542 --> 00:54:52,917
Gives me nightmares sometimes,

597
00:54:52,917 --> 00:54:54,417
well, the same nightmare really,

598
00:54:56,125 --> 00:54:58,042
that the trees are closing in

599
00:54:58,042 --> 00:55:00,792
and there are only the
walls to stop them.

600
00:55:17,167 --> 00:55:20,042
I just found Mr.
Birkin on the doorstep,

601
00:55:20,042 --> 00:55:22,083
but you couldn't hear the bell.

602
00:55:22,083 --> 00:55:23,125
- No, I suppose not.

603
00:55:24,042 --> 00:55:25,500
At least, I didn't hear it.

604
00:55:28,375 --> 00:55:30,333
- We don't have many
visitors, you see.

605
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:35,125
- No, one gets out of the
habit of listening for them.

606
00:55:39,333 --> 00:55:41,125
- I was just saying
to Mr. Birkin,

607
00:55:41,125 --> 00:55:43,625
such a big house for
the two of us, isn't it?

608
00:55:45,125 --> 00:55:47,750
- Yes, yes it is, really.

609
00:55:52,375 --> 00:55:55,042
- And the rooms, we don't
know how to fill them, do we?

610
00:55:55,042 --> 00:55:56,458
- No, no, that's true.

611
00:56:00,542 --> 00:56:01,458
- Except for that.

612
00:56:03,542 --> 00:56:05,167
At least it's big enough.

613
00:56:05,167 --> 00:56:07,167
We don't know what it
is or what it does.

614
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:10,083
It seems to be part
of something else.

615
00:56:10,083 --> 00:56:12,292
My husband's father bought
it in an auction sale

616
00:56:12,292 --> 00:56:14,750
because nobody else wanted it.

617
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:16,542
To help fill up the
room, didn't he?

618
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:19,042
- That's right, he did.

619
00:56:25,667 --> 00:56:30,167
- I just came to sort out
the question of my money.

620
00:56:31,417 --> 00:56:32,333
- The money.

621
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:38,375
I suppose you brought
a receipt, Mr. Birkin.

622
00:56:38,375 --> 00:56:39,375
- A receipt?

623
00:56:39,375 --> 00:56:40,167
- For the money.

624
00:56:41,958 --> 00:56:45,083
I sent Mossop with your
installment this morning.

625
00:56:46,458 --> 00:56:47,750
Didn't he give it to you?

626
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:53,208
- We must've passed each other.

627
00:56:57,458 --> 00:57:01,375
- Well, perhaps you'd like
to see the rest of the house?

628
00:57:01,375 --> 00:57:03,792
- Thank you, I have
to get back to work.

629
00:57:08,125 --> 00:57:09,750
- Did you come by the wood?

630
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:10,542
- No, the road.

631
00:57:12,042 --> 00:57:13,875
- Well, I'll show you
the way through the wood.

632
00:57:21,458 --> 00:57:23,125
- When are you going to
show my wife the painting.

633
00:57:23,125 --> 00:57:24,833
She's very anxious to see it.

634
00:57:24,833 --> 00:57:26,042
- Oh, I've already seen it.

635
00:57:27,208 --> 00:57:28,250
- Have you?

636
00:57:31,042 --> 00:57:32,250
I haven't realized.

637
00:57:34,958 --> 00:57:37,667
(shoes clacking)

638
00:57:48,292 --> 00:57:50,167
- These are my roses.

639
00:57:52,542 --> 00:57:54,125
I spend a lot of time on then.

640
00:57:55,625 --> 00:57:57,208
But I don't know why,

641
00:57:57,208 --> 00:57:58,958
because there really isn't
anyone to look at them but me.

642
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,500
This is a Van Fleet.

643
00:58:04,125 --> 00:58:05,250
Very old variety.

644
00:58:09,125 --> 00:58:12,042
(birds chirping)

645
00:58:19,333 --> 00:58:20,833
Mind the sharp thorns.

646
00:58:22,583 --> 00:58:24,292
They keep blooming until autumn

647
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,125
so you'll know
when summer's ended

648
00:58:27,125 --> 00:58:30,917
because I usually wear
one of the last in my hat.

649
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:40,167
(peaceful music)

650
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:04,500
- This beautiful,
a kind of paradise.

651
00:59:10,292 --> 00:59:11,333
- Look.

652
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,792
- Many men would say that you
were beautiful, Mrs. Keach.

653
00:59:26,958 --> 00:59:28,292
- Oh.

654
00:59:28,292 --> 00:59:29,625
(gun roars)
(Tom gasps)

655
00:59:29,625 --> 00:59:32,333
(birds chirping)

656
01:00:14,208 --> 01:00:18,875
- Yes, well, that's what comes
of believing in paradise.

657
01:00:25,083 --> 01:00:28,083
(branches rustling)

658
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:37,125
- Oh.

659
01:00:44,792 --> 01:00:47,458
(peaceful music)

660
01:01:26,375 --> 01:01:27,458
- Look at this.

661
01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:34,042
Have you ever seen
a detail like this

662
01:01:34,042 --> 01:01:35,250
in a medieval painting?

663
01:01:36,667 --> 01:01:38,625
Anticipates the
Bruegels by 100 years.

664
01:01:40,333 --> 01:01:42,958
That face meant
something to him.

665
01:01:42,958 --> 01:01:44,333
It's a portrait, must be.

666
01:01:46,542 --> 01:01:48,250
And he was covered over
years before the rest.

667
01:01:49,333 --> 01:01:50,292
- It's the crescent.

668
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:54,417
One could swear he was almost
meant to be identifiable.

669
01:01:54,417 --> 01:01:56,500
Would he have
dared, your painter?

670
01:01:57,917 --> 01:01:59,250
And what was he like?

671
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:01,167
You must know him
pretty well by now.

672
01:02:01,167 --> 01:02:01,958
- I can't even
put a name to him.

673
01:02:01,958 --> 01:02:02,875
He hasn't signed it.

674
01:02:04,333 --> 01:02:05,917
Why would he, our idea of person

675
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:09,708
may have meant nothing to him.

676
01:02:09,708 --> 01:02:12,542
But he was fair-haired
and I know that

677
01:02:12,542 --> 01:02:14,375
from hairs that keep turning up

678
01:02:14,375 --> 01:02:15,917
where his beard
prodded into the paint.

679
01:02:17,125 --> 01:02:19,708
He was right handed,
about your build.

680
01:02:19,708 --> 01:02:22,083
And he needed a step ladder
to get up to six foot.

681
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:28,542
The weird thing is, he didn't
finish the job himself.

682
01:02:28,542 --> 01:02:30,417
See this bit here?

683
01:02:30,417 --> 01:02:32,542
It's a rough job, fill in.

684
01:02:32,542 --> 01:02:34,042
Probably done by his apprentice.

685
01:02:35,417 --> 01:02:36,667
I cannot imagine why.

686
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:41,000
Just when his nose was
past the finishing post.

687
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,750
And he knew this
was his great work.

688
01:02:46,083 --> 01:02:47,000
You can feel it, can't you?

689
01:02:48,917 --> 01:02:51,375
Everything he'd done before
was just a run up to this.

690
01:02:52,792 --> 01:02:54,833
He sweated here.

691
01:02:54,833 --> 01:02:55,667
Tossed in his bed.

692
01:02:58,500 --> 01:02:59,708
Groaned, howled over it.

693
01:03:02,833 --> 01:03:05,708
- And he shall come
with woundes red, eh?

694
01:03:11,375 --> 01:03:12,708
Well done.

695
01:03:12,708 --> 01:03:15,583
(melancholy music)

696
01:03:36,292 --> 01:03:39,000
(dramatic music)

697
01:03:52,792 --> 01:03:54,208
- Moon, he fell!

698
01:03:55,292 --> 01:03:56,208
That's why he didn't finish it.

699
01:03:56,208 --> 01:03:57,417
It was his last job, he fell!

700
01:03:59,167 --> 01:04:02,458
- Oh, well you better
watch it then, eh?

701
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:15,875
(train whistle tweets)

702
01:04:25,417 --> 01:04:29,417
- Ah, but Mr. Birkin, you've
a real eye for quality.

703
01:04:29,417 --> 01:04:31,375
That anybody can tell.

704
01:04:31,375 --> 01:04:33,708
We want the best there is.

705
01:04:33,708 --> 01:04:35,625
- What's more to the
point, Mr. Birkin,

706
01:04:35,625 --> 01:04:38,250
is we want best we can afford.

707
01:04:45,542 --> 01:04:50,542
(people chattering)
(animals braying)

708
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:22,250
(man whistles)

709
01:05:22,250 --> 01:05:23,750
- Look at this lot.

710
01:05:26,417 --> 01:05:29,542
(bright organ music)

711
01:05:50,708 --> 01:05:53,458
- Well I'm no great
musician, Mr. Birkin.

712
01:05:53,458 --> 01:05:55,167
I'll freely admit that,

713
01:05:55,167 --> 01:05:58,667
but there's one thing I do
know about and that's wind.

714
01:05:58,667 --> 01:06:00,792
Jack, no.

715
01:06:00,792 --> 01:06:02,792
- What do you think, Mr. Birkin?

716
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:06,750
- Well, this one vibrates.

717
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:08,875
- That's right, that it does.

718
01:06:08,875 --> 01:06:10,375
- And that one smells odd.

719
01:06:10,375 --> 01:06:15,083
- Then this is the one
we test to the limit.

720
01:06:15,083 --> 01:06:15,875
Kathy, lass.

721
01:06:19,167 --> 01:06:22,292
(bright organ music)

722
01:06:31,667 --> 01:06:32,750
- Go and quiet him.

723
01:06:32,750 --> 01:06:35,833
He's gonna make that
din for, Mr. Birkin.

724
01:06:35,833 --> 01:06:38,917
(bright organ music)

725
01:06:45,625 --> 01:06:46,625
- Excuse me.

726
01:06:53,583 --> 01:06:58,583
♪ Love of ages left for me ♪

727
01:06:59,667 --> 01:07:01,667
♪ Shall be he ♪

728
01:07:01,667 --> 01:07:05,917
♪ Let the water and the plant ♪

729
01:07:05,917 --> 01:07:09,417
♪ From thy river
site which flowed ♪

730
01:07:09,417 --> 01:07:12,208
- I must prefer
the jollier hints.

731
01:07:39,042 --> 01:07:41,625
- [George] I was
impressed, Jack.

732
01:07:41,625 --> 01:07:45,125
There's a deep resonance
of its bass notes,

733
01:07:45,125 --> 01:07:46,458
I think you'll
agree with me there.

734
01:07:46,458 --> 01:07:47,458
- Aye, sound as a bell.

735
01:07:47,458 --> 01:07:50,000
Now that, Mr. Birkin, was music.

736
01:07:54,083 --> 01:07:54,875
- Beautiful.

737
01:07:57,333 --> 01:07:58,083
- [Jack] That's it then.

738
01:07:58,083 --> 01:07:59,375
We'll have the Albudeck.

739
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:00,667
- Any discount for cash down?

740
01:08:00,667 --> 01:08:02,750
- Aye, a couple of quid
off for cash in hand.

741
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:04,000
- Good man.

742
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,292
- And to include
delivery of course.

743
01:08:05,292 --> 01:08:06,500
- [Organ Salesman] Where to?

744
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:07,708
- Oxgodby.
- Chapel.

745
01:08:07,708 --> 01:08:09,083
- Good day.
- Good day.

746
01:08:11,125 --> 01:08:16,125
(people chattering)
(bells ringing)

747
01:08:26,542 --> 01:08:27,458
- Actually, I'd quite
like to have a look

748
01:08:27,458 --> 01:08:30,042
at the church a moment.

749
01:08:30,042 --> 01:08:31,792
- Come on,
(indistinct), come on.

750
01:08:31,792 --> 01:08:33,292
- See thee later.

751
01:08:33,292 --> 01:08:36,792
(townspeople chattering)

752
01:10:00,542 --> 01:10:04,042
- Excuse me, you
here from Oxgodby?

753
01:10:04,042 --> 01:10:06,167
- Yes, but just visiting.

754
01:10:07,667 --> 01:10:10,875
- Have you bumped into a
chap called Moon over there?

755
01:10:10,875 --> 01:10:13,917
James Moon, digging up
some fields or summat?

756
01:10:13,917 --> 01:10:15,458
- Yes I have.

757
01:10:15,458 --> 01:10:20,167
- And is he a stocky fair-haired
sorta chap, smiles a lot?

758
01:10:22,083 --> 01:10:23,708
- That's pretty well him, yes.

759
01:10:24,833 --> 01:10:26,917
- A captain in the
18th Norfolk Artillery?

760
01:10:30,917 --> 01:10:32,750
That clinches it then.

761
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:34,125
Must be the same chap.

762
01:10:35,625 --> 01:10:38,250
Would you give him
a salute from me?

763
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:39,792
- Of course.

764
01:10:39,792 --> 01:10:42,125
- And all the other officers
in the 18th Norfolk.

765
01:10:43,750 --> 01:10:45,792
The ones who didn't sit
out the last six months

766
01:10:45,792 --> 01:10:48,125
of the war in a glass
house, like our hero did.

767
01:10:52,417 --> 01:10:53,667
For buggerin' his batman.

768
01:11:00,333 --> 01:11:03,125
(hooves clopping)

769
01:11:26,875 --> 01:11:28,375
- Want some milk?

770
01:11:29,917 --> 01:11:30,958
- No.

771
01:11:33,250 --> 01:11:34,042
Thanks.

772
01:11:36,958 --> 01:11:39,208
(sheep bleating)

773
01:11:39,208 --> 01:11:40,792
- It agrees with
you, doesn't it?

774
01:11:42,625 --> 01:11:43,875
- What does?

775
01:11:43,875 --> 01:11:44,667
- Oxgodby.

776
01:11:46,750 --> 01:11:48,083
Since you've been here,
they've almost gone,

777
01:11:48,083 --> 01:11:50,167
your twitch, tremor and stammer.

778
01:11:52,875 --> 01:11:54,042
- Yes, I suppose they have.

779
01:11:56,875 --> 01:11:57,625
Hadn't noticed.

780
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:03,000
- What about the
vicar's lovely lady?

781
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,333
You seen anything of her?

782
01:12:06,917 --> 01:12:07,792
- No, not really.

783
01:12:09,875 --> 01:12:10,917
- Oh, pity.

784
01:12:13,417 --> 01:12:14,208
- Is it?

785
01:12:21,667 --> 01:12:22,458
- No, not really.

786
01:12:28,875 --> 01:12:32,417
Better off without
it, aren't we?

787
01:12:32,417 --> 01:12:34,667
We want an easy life.

788
01:12:34,667 --> 01:12:37,375
(birds chirping)

789
01:12:49,792 --> 01:12:52,250
- Well, here's to an easy life.

790
01:12:55,958 --> 01:12:58,833
(peaceful music)

791
01:13:19,583 --> 01:13:21,417
- [Townsman] All
right, all right.

792
01:13:21,417 --> 01:13:24,792
Come on, Dan, I'll
buy you a pint.

793
01:13:24,792 --> 01:13:27,042
- I have wanted it to happen.

794
01:13:28,667 --> 01:13:31,000
There were times when
I'd just had enough.

795
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,583
Well, you know that.

796
01:13:35,833 --> 01:13:36,625
So many had gone.

797
01:13:38,958 --> 01:13:40,167
Chaps I cared for.

798
01:13:42,875 --> 01:13:45,250
Sometimes it seemed like
they were the lucky ones.

799
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:49,875
Night's a bad time.

800
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
I expect you've heard me.

801
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,417
I still wake up screaming.

802
01:13:57,125 --> 01:13:58,208
I can still see them.

803
01:14:00,875 --> 01:14:01,958
Still see.

804
01:14:05,333 --> 01:14:08,458
And I tell myself it'll
get better as time passes

805
01:14:08,458 --> 01:14:10,042
and it sinks further back.

806
01:14:12,708 --> 01:14:14,250
But it's got nowhere
to sink to, has it?

807
01:14:16,458 --> 01:14:17,750
We'll always be
different, won't we?

808
01:14:17,750 --> 01:14:19,042
The whole lot of us,

809
01:14:19,042 --> 01:14:21,375
all the millions of
us that survived.

810
01:14:21,375 --> 01:14:22,958
If millions did.

811
01:14:24,458 --> 01:14:27,250
Different, I mean, from the
generations who went before

812
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:30,250
who had no idea that anything
like that could ever happen.

813
01:14:33,083 --> 01:14:34,042
I don't know if it's worse

814
01:14:34,042 --> 01:14:35,333
not having something
to show for it

815
01:14:35,333 --> 01:14:39,958
like a lost limb or
two or blindness.

816
01:14:41,708 --> 01:14:46,125
I mean, people like you
and me, the intact ones.

817
01:14:49,875 --> 01:14:51,917
Worst part for me was
the last six months

818
01:14:53,250 --> 01:14:55,208
when I was kept away
from the fighting.

819
01:14:56,625 --> 01:14:59,042
Went for months without
seeing a single corpse.

820
01:15:01,167 --> 01:15:02,292
Faces that I did see

821
01:15:08,208 --> 01:15:09,000
passed.

822
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,000
A little bit round
the bend, you know?

823
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,292
Always will be, I expect.

824
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Still, no point in letting
it get one down, eh?

825
01:15:32,792 --> 01:15:35,083
One has one's life to lead.

826
01:15:36,125 --> 01:15:39,625
And then he shall come
with woundes red, eh?

827
01:15:40,875 --> 01:15:43,042
To damn the quick and the dead.

828
01:15:47,083 --> 01:15:49,333
- You got a Military
Cross, didn't you?

829
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:52,375
I saw it in your tent.

830
01:15:56,708 --> 01:16:01,625
- I did.

831
01:16:02,458 --> 01:16:04,167
There go the chapel lot again.

832
01:16:04,167 --> 01:16:06,083
Once they buy
themselves a new organ.

833
01:16:07,583 --> 01:16:10,250
(peaceful music)

834
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,208
- Well, what is it?

835
01:16:32,625 --> 01:16:36,875
- Either a boulder deep
than it ought to be

836
01:16:36,875 --> 01:16:39,125
or the lid of a stone
coffin, perhaps.

837
01:16:46,042 --> 01:16:47,708
Do you know what this is for?

838
01:17:17,125 --> 01:17:18,417
Isn't it exciting?

839
01:17:18,417 --> 01:17:21,083
Digging where someone must've
dug 5, 600 years ago hm?

840
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:27,292
Well, you're spoiled of course.

841
01:17:27,292 --> 01:17:29,292
You clean a wall and
uncover a masterpiece.

842
01:17:29,292 --> 01:17:32,750
Turn over the earth and
expect to find a pot of gold.

843
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:36,250
But we diggers, we
keep our palates fresh.

844
01:17:37,458 --> 01:17:40,375
Miles of deviation of
tinge is all we need

845
01:17:41,708 --> 01:17:43,625
to stir the blood.

846
01:17:43,625 --> 01:17:45,500
Haven't you noticed that
you're throwing up soil

847
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:47,417
that should've been
three spits deeper.

848
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:49,292
Thank you.

849
01:17:54,167 --> 01:17:55,208
Ah!

850
01:18:07,458 --> 01:18:11,208
Horn button, 15th
century, right on target.

851
01:18:12,417 --> 01:18:14,250
- Well, come on, is
it Piers or isn't it?

852
01:18:25,250 --> 01:18:28,875
(speaking in Latin)

853
01:18:28,875 --> 01:18:30,750
- I of all men,
the most wretched.

854
01:18:32,375 --> 01:18:35,375
They really had it in for
the poor devil, didn't they?

855
01:18:35,375 --> 01:18:36,375
Wonder why.

856
01:18:38,042 --> 01:18:41,292
Oh, well, I suppose
we shall never know.

857
01:18:43,375 --> 01:18:45,292
Come on, let's take a look.

858
01:18:45,292 --> 01:18:48,000
(men groaning)

859
01:18:49,375 --> 01:18:52,375
(suspenseful music)

860
01:18:56,792 --> 01:18:57,583
Third rib down.

861
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:15,792
(indistinct)

862
01:19:23,167 --> 01:19:27,333
So Piers was a Muslim.

863
01:19:29,375 --> 01:19:30,958
A Muslim in Oxgodby.

864
01:19:32,208 --> 01:19:33,458
He must've got caught up

865
01:19:33,458 --> 01:19:36,042
in some medieval
crusade, I suppose.

866
01:19:36,042 --> 01:19:38,250
Converted to save his skin.

867
01:19:38,250 --> 01:19:40,417
Imagine the ruction
when he turned up here,

868
01:19:40,417 --> 01:19:42,333
and was still
worshiping to the east.

869
01:19:43,917 --> 01:19:46,083
Well, no wonder they buried
him outside the churchyard.

870
01:19:47,667 --> 01:19:52,250
Well, well, both our
mysteries solved.

871
01:19:53,667 --> 01:19:55,875
- It was the same
mystery wasn't it?

872
01:20:45,292 --> 01:20:47,333
- Mossop told me you'd finished.

873
01:20:47,333 --> 01:20:48,250
I can see you have.

874
01:20:50,292 --> 01:20:51,042
Very good.

875
01:20:52,375 --> 01:20:55,333
In accordance with the
executives' wishes,

876
01:20:55,333 --> 01:20:57,625
here's the final payment
of Miss Hebron's estate.

877
01:21:00,250 --> 01:21:03,583
13 pound 15 shillings,
as was agreed.

878
01:21:05,417 --> 01:21:06,792
- What do you think of it?

879
01:21:07,792 --> 01:21:10,083
- Well, it's there.

880
01:21:12,250 --> 01:21:14,500
So you've done the job
you're contracted for

881
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:15,292
and now you've been paid.

882
01:21:15,292 --> 01:21:16,333
- Thank you.

883
01:21:18,667 --> 01:21:21,250
Of course I'll need
the scaffolding for
several more days.

884
01:21:23,292 --> 01:21:24,333
- Why?

885
01:21:24,333 --> 01:21:25,583
- Because I haven't finished.

886
01:21:27,708 --> 01:21:29,500
- What remains to be done?

887
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:30,625
- That's for me to decide.

888
01:21:34,833 --> 01:21:36,833
- I shall have the
scaffolding removed.

889
01:21:36,833 --> 01:21:37,583
- Oh will you?

890
01:21:38,708 --> 01:21:40,000
Then I shall inform
the executives

891
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,458
that you prevented me
from completing my work,

892
01:21:43,667 --> 01:21:45,375
which will leave them
with the obligation

893
01:21:45,375 --> 01:21:47,667
to contribute 1000 pounds to
your fabric fund, won't it?

894
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:54,125
- I should not wish to
quarrel with you, Mr. Birkin.

895
01:22:05,167 --> 01:22:09,583
I know how you see me, Mr.
Birkin, the way you want to.

896
01:22:11,708 --> 01:22:13,083
You've never thought
what it's like

897
01:22:13,083 --> 01:22:14,583
for a man like me, have you?

898
01:22:16,250 --> 01:22:18,875
The English are not a
deeply religious people.

899
01:22:20,042 --> 01:22:22,542
Most of those who attend
divine service do so

900
01:22:22,542 --> 01:22:23,917
only from habit.

901
01:22:23,917 --> 01:22:26,250
Their acceptance of the
sacrament is perfunctory.

902
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:29,083
I've yet to meet the
man whose hair rose

903
01:22:29,083 --> 01:22:30,458
at the nape of his neck,

904
01:22:30,458 --> 01:22:32,875
because he was about to taste
the blood of his dying Lord.

905
01:22:34,458 --> 01:22:36,167
Will I find such
a man in Oxgodby?

906
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:40,542
Even when they come to my
church in large numbers

907
01:22:40,542 --> 01:22:44,583
at harvest, Thanksgiving, or
Christmas, midnight masses,

908
01:22:45,875 --> 01:22:48,208
it's really a pagan salute to
the passing of the seasons.

909
01:22:48,208 --> 01:22:49,208
They do not need me.

910
01:22:51,417 --> 01:22:53,167
They merely find me useful.

911
01:22:54,375 --> 01:22:57,375
Baptisms, weddings, funerals,
oh, chiefly funerals,

912
01:22:57,375 --> 01:23:00,167
because I see to the orderly
disposal of their dead.

913
01:23:02,917 --> 01:23:04,250
But I'm embarrassing you.

914
01:23:05,542 --> 01:23:07,708
And embarrassing people
is a grave sin, is it not?

915
01:23:11,375 --> 01:23:13,417
If you could let me know

916
01:23:13,417 --> 01:23:16,417
when I might have the
scaffolding dismantled.

917
01:23:23,792 --> 01:23:26,667
(melancholy music)

918
01:24:12,292 --> 01:24:13,667
- I hear you've finished.

919
01:24:13,667 --> 01:24:14,458
- Yes.

920
01:24:17,708 --> 01:24:21,583
- I brought you some
apples to say goodbye with.

921
01:24:21,583 --> 01:24:23,125
- Thank you.

922
01:24:23,125 --> 01:24:24,250
- They're Ribston Pippins.

923
01:24:24,250 --> 01:24:25,583
They do very well up here.

924
01:24:25,583 --> 01:24:27,500
Exactly the right
soil and climate.

925
01:24:28,625 --> 01:24:30,583
Lots of other varieties
don't take though.

926
01:24:32,333 --> 01:24:34,667
- You're an expert on
apples too, are you?

927
01:24:37,292 --> 01:24:38,667
- I am.

928
01:24:38,667 --> 01:24:40,042
My father taught me.

929
01:24:41,542 --> 01:24:43,583
Before he bit into one,

930
01:24:44,875 --> 01:24:49,417
he'd sniff it and roll it
around and his cupped palms

931
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,417
and he'd smell his hands

932
01:24:53,542 --> 01:24:56,083
and he'd tap and finger
it like a blind man.

933
01:24:57,292 --> 01:25:00,583
Sometimes he'd ask
me to close my eyes

934
01:25:00,583 --> 01:25:02,750
and when I'd taken a
bite, say which apple.

935
01:25:13,292 --> 01:25:14,125
So.

936
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,625
So this is where you've
been living all this time.

937
01:25:20,583 --> 01:25:23,250
(birds chirping)

938
01:25:37,625 --> 01:25:39,708
And there's Mr. Moon.

939
01:25:39,708 --> 01:25:40,458
- Yes.

940
01:25:43,792 --> 01:25:48,792
He's dug up the bones he
was commissioned to dig up.

941
01:25:51,583 --> 01:25:53,917
Turned up an Anglo-Saxon
basilica in the process.

942
01:25:55,875 --> 01:25:57,667
Basilica's what he
really came for.

943
01:26:00,833 --> 01:26:01,625
Knew it was here.

944
01:26:04,583 --> 01:26:06,875
- So you've both found
what you came to find.

945
01:26:10,833 --> 01:26:11,625
- Well, I-

946
01:26:22,625 --> 01:26:25,542
(melancholy music)

947
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,542
- Well, I'm glad.

948
01:26:41,750 --> 01:26:42,792
Oh.

949
01:26:58,125 --> 01:26:58,917
Your book.

950
01:28:05,583 --> 01:28:06,375
- Hello?

951
01:28:09,250 --> 01:28:10,125
Mr. Birkin?

952
01:28:13,875 --> 01:28:14,750
Mr. Birkin!

953
01:28:50,417 --> 01:28:51,708
- Letter for you.

954
01:28:55,750 --> 01:28:57,292
Postman asked me to bring it in.

955
01:29:01,542 --> 01:29:02,333
- Thank you.

956
01:29:05,708 --> 01:29:06,750
It's from my wife, Finny.

957
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:10,875
Probably wants us
to start over again.

958
01:29:10,875 --> 01:29:11,667
She usually does.

959
01:29:12,708 --> 01:29:13,750
- And will you?

960
01:29:14,750 --> 01:29:15,792
- I usually do.

961
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:23,875
So, where are you off to?

962
01:29:24,833 --> 01:29:25,750
- Basra Baghdad.

963
01:29:26,750 --> 01:29:28,208
Big dig going on over there.

964
01:29:28,208 --> 01:29:29,958
Like to get in on it.

965
01:29:29,958 --> 01:29:30,750
- [Tom] Right.

966
01:29:32,208 --> 01:29:33,500
- [James] What about you?

967
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:34,708
- Oh, I don't know.

968
01:29:36,917 --> 01:29:39,292
Wait for another
church, I suppose.

969
01:29:39,292 --> 01:29:41,375
- You'll never get
another one like this.

970
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:43,792
- I know.

971
01:29:43,792 --> 01:29:46,750
(birds chirping)

972
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,083
Been a summer, hasn't it?

973
01:30:03,375 --> 01:30:04,500
- So, anyway.

974
01:30:09,208 --> 01:30:10,000
Well...

975
01:30:11,250 --> 01:30:13,917
(shoes clacking)

976
01:30:24,917 --> 01:30:27,833
(birds chirping)

977
01:32:01,083 --> 01:32:03,750
(reverent music)

978
01:32:50,333 --> 01:32:54,500
- [Kathy] Hello
there, Mr. Birkin.

979
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:55,958
I'm Kathy Ellerbeck!

980
01:32:55,958 --> 01:32:59,042
(triumphant music)

981
01:33:02,958 --> 01:33:06,042
(children murmuring)

982
01:34:47,167 --> 01:34:50,208
(dramatic music)
