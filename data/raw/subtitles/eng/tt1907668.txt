Yeah.

00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:26,120
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

5
00:01:27,112 --> 00:01:29,356
Wait a minute, slow down.

6
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,796
Hold on.

7
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,715
No, I've been up since the...
crack ‘adawn.

8
00:01:50,084 --> 00:01:52,603
What tuition?

9
00:01:54,434 --> 00:01:56,247
How much does it cost?

10
00:01:57,423 --> 00:01:59,147
No.

11
00:02:00,076 --> 00:02:02,652
No, no that's not true,
that's not true.

12
00:02:02,677 --> 00:02:05,382
You're the one that wanted him
to go to a private school, not me.

13
00:02:05,768 --> 00:02:08,199
Then put Knuckles on the phone.

14
00:02:10,332 --> 00:02:14,000
Then tell him it's a two-way street,
I call him, he's gotta call me.

15
00:02:15,363 --> 00:02:17,601
Oh, he's my son now?

16
00:02:17,796 --> 00:02:21,421
Because you want him to go to...
you wanna fuckin' tuition check.

17
00:02:25,483 --> 00:02:28,155
That's great, Deana.
That's great.

18
00:02:28,384 --> 00:02:30,478
You call me at 7 o'clock
in the morning in Orlando

19
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:32,382
to shake me down for
fuckin' money. That's great.

20
00:02:32,431 --> 00:02:34,893
Does he even wanna go
to the fuckin' school?

21
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:39,720
Alright, look just...

22
00:02:40,136 --> 00:02:44,699
I got a nine o'clock flight. Sit tight,
I'll be in Atlanta in a minute.

23
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,129
How am I a liar?

24
00:02:48,348 --> 00:02:50,439
Yeah, but how does that make me a liar?

25
00:02:51,688 --> 00:02:52,808
How-

26
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:56,535
Alright...

00:03:00,528 --> 00:03:02,715
Alright.

00:03:10,917 --> 00:03:14,731
But you, Trina, could my second wife.

32
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,796

00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,141

00:04:53,452 --> 00:04:56,600
Don't worry, I’m gonna get you

48
00:04:56,628 --> 00:04:59,915
What is it? Jesus Christ Superstar?

49
00:05:00,015 --> 00:05:03,378
That's right, Christ The King First
Baptist Church, on Hazel and 9th,

50
00:05:03,382 --> 00:05:05,699

– I don't think so, sir.

61
00:05:28,153 --> 00:05:29,408
You sure?

00:05:29,658 --> 00:05:31,244
Yeah. Ken Evans.

77
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,283

00:07:03,088 --> 00:07:05,039
Don't pick-up.

86
00:07:10,423 --> 00:07:11,823
<i>Hello?</i>

87
00:07:12,453 --> 00:07:14,516
Hi, it's Nic, do you have any?

88
00:07:17,342 --> 00:07:18,300
Kip.

89
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,740
Hey baby, come here, how are you?

90
00:07:21,005 --> 00:07:23,912
It's good to see you.
Nicole, this is Tiki Pot.

91
00:07:24,092 --> 00:07:26,779
Tiki is my partner in this new series,
he knows a lot of porn.

92
00:07:26,817 --> 00:07:28,055
Kip, I need two grams.

93
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:30,749
We are putting the narrative
back in the porn, baby, and...

94
00:07:32,002 --> 00:07:33,205
Desdemona.

95
00:07:33,206 --> 00:07:36,313
You could totally play Desdemona.
Look at you. You're perfect.

96
00:07:36,368 --> 00:07:38,467
Fuck yeah, you're perfect.
Let's... beautiful.

97
00:07:38,513 --> 00:07:40,706
She do anal, 2000 one hour.

98
00:07:40,904 --> 00:07:42,706
Alright, I don't do porn, Kip.

99
00:07:42,794 --> 00:07:44,766
– Okay, listen.
– Just... let me see the "h".

100
00:07:44,767 --> 00:07:46,020
– It's an Othello theme, okay,

101
00:07:46,238 --> 00:07:48,781
the Moor comes in, finds you
in bed upon his nurses...

102
00:07:48,881 --> 00:07:50,827
And he fucks me in the ass, huh?

103
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,875
College student. Very clean. Brett?

104
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,227
Wait, we're puttin' a whole new spin on
"The beast with two backs", baby.

105
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,400
In fact, that's what it's called,

106
00:07:56,431 --> 00:07:57,807
"The beast with two backs"...
– Is that why you told me

107
00:07:57,817 --> 00:08:00,423
you had somebody handling it.
– .. or "Hole-thello", or "Butt-hole thello".

108
00:08:00,454 --> 00:08:02,654
Show her the pipe, huh?

109
00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:06,647
Tiki, that's your name?

110
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:11,097
Why n'you shove that in your ass
and you call me in the morning?

111
00:08:11,113 --> 00:08:12,801
Hey, Nicole.
Nicole!

112
00:08:13,623 --> 00:08:16,355
Hey slow down. Slow down!
Nic, sorry, alright? We're tweaked.

113
00:08:16,385 --> 00:08:17,607
Okay, I am sorry.

114
00:08:17,608 --> 00:08:19,707
Just stick around, it's not a big deal,

115
00:08:19,722 --> 00:08:22,230
you gonna take some
stills for me or something.

116
00:08:22,262 --> 00:08:25,032
What's going on with you?
I thought you were clean?

117
00:08:25,075 --> 00:08:28,657
And now you're... you're
like freakin' out on me.

118
00:08:29,328 --> 00:08:30,700
Com'on.

119
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,374
Don't cry.

120
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:33,745
I...

121
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:36,429
I just want to get faded, Kip.

122
00:08:37,445 --> 00:08:39,488
I have a hundred, please.
– I don't want...

123
00:08:39,513 --> 00:08:42,763
No, keep it, keep it.
I don't want it, okay?

124
00:08:43,111 --> 00:08:44,879
Listen.

125
00:08:45,128 --> 00:08:46,834
This is the 'Taliban'. Okay?

126
00:08:47,346 --> 00:08:49,959
Very heavy. Okay?
– I can handle it.

127
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:53,133
I don't want you shooting this shit,
it's too heavy, alright?

128
00:08:53,185 --> 00:08:55,582
I won't. I promise.

129
00:08:57,385 --> 00:09:00,906
I'm just gonna smoke it out.
I haven't... used needles in weeks.

130
00:09:00,921 --> 00:09:05,213
Okay. No needles.
And if you get a little too low...

131
00:09:05,248 --> 00:09:07,644
you just do a little coke, okay,
get yourself back up.

132
00:09:07,763 --> 00:09:11,002
Alright, where you would need to be.
Alright?

133
00:09:11,113 --> 00:09:13,923
– Yeah... Thanks.
– Okay baby.

134
00:09:13,951 --> 00:09:16,833
<i>.. and that all your carry-on items are

136
00:09:18,556 --> 00:09:21,893
<i>Also all electronic devices must
be turned off at this time.</i>

137
00:09:21,905 --> 00:09:24,972
Our flight time to Atlanta
is approximately 52 minutes,

138
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:27,259
flight attendants, take your seat.

139
00:09:29,557 --> 00:09:32,521
So what'd you do last night?
I crashed and went straight to bed.

140
00:09:32,733 --> 00:09:34,541
All right, here we go.

141
00:09:37,168 --> 00:09:39,243
Engine instruments, sir in the green,

142
00:09:39,293 --> 00:09:41,814
air speed's alive both side,

143
00:09:41,997 --> 00:09:43,671
80 knots, crosscheck.

144
00:09:43,672 --> 00:09:45,598
It's like a video game, right?

145
00:09:48,814 --> 00:09:54,644
Nothin' like a little... 30 knot cross
wind to exercise the ol' sphincter muscle.

146
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:56,371
E1...

147
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:58,863
and rotate.

148
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,184
We're to positive rate.

149
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:04,701
Gear up.

150
00:10:05,865 --> 00:10:08,900

00:10:25,402 --> 00:10:28,701
we've got some wild chop,
I’d say moderate to...

158
00:10:32,144 --> 00:10:35,458
I’d say severe turbulence,
definitely severe turbulence.

159
00:10:35,998 --> 00:10:38,699

– Levelling off.
– What?

166
00:11:05,369 --> 00:11:08,590
See that little sliver of black
between those two ugly clouds?

167
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:11,294
That’s a pocket of smooth air
squatting right over Kissimmee.

168
00:11:11,357 --> 00:11:14,322
Gonna thread that needle.
Turn us right, thirty degrees.

183
00:11:49,232 --> 00:11:49,919
It's awkward.

Don't ever fucking touch my camera.
Now get out!

203
00:13:42,158 --> 00:13:45,506
Hey! Now as an building manager,
I got a legal right to enter an apartment.

204
00:13:45,932 --> 00:13:48,072
Especially if I feel the
occupant be unwell,

205
00:13:48,073 --> 00:13:50,554
and the occupant is not
current on her rent.

206
00:13:50,593 --> 00:13:52,413
Just give me a minute.

207
00:13:53,088 --> 00:13:56,103
Fran, I have your rent,
I wiill bring it down to you, okay?

208
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:58,801
Just let me take a shower.

209
00:13:58,849 --> 00:14:00,669
You shower in my house.

210
00:14:01,057 --> 00:14:04,133
You know, bring that money down,
and we shower together.

00:14:04,715 --> 00:14:07,462
Got that good water pressure.

212

You know that, ain'ya?

213
00:14:11,423 --> 00:14:13,492
You’re in the perfect light there, Fran.

214
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,175
– Yeah?
– Hmm. Back up a little.

215
00:14:17,663 --> 00:14:19,533
Little more.

216
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:25,713
Alright... Tricky tricky, girl.

217
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,601
Now uh...

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm Captain Whitaker,

221
00:14:53,163 --> 00:14:57,081
if you look up, you'll see me here
in the forward galley, I waive to you.

222
00:14:59,146 --> 00:15:02,033
I want to apologize for
the bumps this morning,

223
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,733
uh, evidently Florida
doesn't like us Georgians.

224
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:09,554
Maybe it has to do with the beatin'
the Bulldogs put on the Gators last fall.

225
00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:13,610
Then I suggest to stretch out and relax,

226
00:15:13,611 --> 00:15:16,592
air might be a little cranky, so we're
gonna ask that you to remain in your seat

fasten around you.

228

today but the flight attendants

with water and with snacks,

232
00:17:00,496 --> 00:17:04,384
Fuck, Nicole. I know you're in there,
I can smell that shit cooking.

233
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,907
Better not you burnin'
down my fuckin' building!

234
00:17:12,687 --> 00:17:14,715
How can anybody sleep like that?

235
00:17:16,734 --> 00:17:17,579
I don't know.

236
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:20,253

337
00:21:48,111 --> 00:21:50,865
Oh, Lord Jesus!

338
00:21:52,959 --> 00:21:54,937
– Alright Evans, flaps.
– Flaps!

339
00:21:55,018 --> 00:21:56,864
– Speed brakes.
– Speed brakes!

340
00:22:06,063 --> 00:22:08,429
Margaret. Power!

341
00:22:10,664 --> 00:22:12,992
– Gear up.
– Gear up!

342
00:22:29,637 --> 00:22:31,020
Jesus, Fuck!

343
00:22:31,321 --> 00:22:32,356
Shit!

344
00:22:32,555 --> 00:22:34,552
Oh Lord Jesus, we're inverted!

345
00:22:34,568 --> 00:22:37,368
Good flying lesson. We’re level,
we can maintain altitude like this.

346
00:22:37,739 --> 00:22:40,192
<i>SouthJet 2-2-7, Atlanta Center,
I see your position</i>

347
00:22:40,195 --> 00:22:41,923
<i>4 and a half miles
southeast of the airport,</i>

348
00:22:41,924 --> 00:22:43,344
<i>descending out of 1,800. Are you OK?</i>

349
00:22:43,396 --> 00:22:45,931
Atlanta Center, this is SouthJet 2-2-7,

350
00:22:45,957 --> 00:22:48,618
we are inverted, I repeat we are inverted.

351
00:22:48,634 --> 00:22:51,147
<i>SoutJet 2-2-7, uh, did you say inverted?</i>

352
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,563
We're losing oil pressure,
pump failure both engines!

353
00:22:53,577 --> 00:22:54,926
We're alright, we're flying.

354
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,512
– Fire in the left engine!

355
00:23:06,513 --> 00:23:08,513
– Fire in the left engine!
– Put it out.

356
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,667
I'm right with you. Look at me,
I'm right with you. Okay?

357
00:23:13,829 --> 00:23:16,496
Atlanta, SouthJet 2-2-7,
where's that airport?

358
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:19,245
<i>2-2-7, it is one O'clock, three miles.</i>

359
00:23:19,352 --> 00:23:21,781
Alright, we're not gonna make that,
our engines are burning up.

360
00:23:21,861 --> 00:23:25,347
I see a field and a road ahead of us,
we're gonna set it down there.

361
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,798
<i>Roger, 2-2-7.</i>

362
00:23:26,862 --> 00:23:28,406
Oh no, fire in the right, now!

363
00:23:28,423 --> 00:23:30,117
Margaret, we're coming back to round.

364
00:23:30,143 --> 00:23:33,504
Margaret, I want you to hit full power,
full throttle, you understand?

365
00:23:33,611 --> 00:23:35,237
Here we go.

366
00:23:35,502 --> 00:23:37,111
Evans, speed brakes.

367
00:23:37,462 --> 00:23:38,731
Speed brakes!

368
00:23:38,768 --> 00:23:40,884
– Flaps full.
– Flaps full.

369
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,870
We're losing the left engine!

370
00:23:59,926 --> 00:24:03,800
<i>SouthJet 2-2-7, I see you descending
through 1000, do you concur?</i>

371
00:24:03,914 --> 00:24:06,016
Margaret, full power.

372
00:24:16,341 --> 00:24:17,814
We lost the left engine!

373
00:24:17,841 --> 00:24:18,689
– Let it go.

374
00:24:18,691 --> 00:24:20,650
– Let it go.
– We're losing power in the right!

375
00:24:22,893 --> 00:24:24,762
We lost all power!

376
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,356
<i>TOO LOW TERRAIN</i>

377
00:24:26,778 --> 00:24:28,153
<i>TOO LOW TERRAIN</i>

378
00:24:28,591 --> 00:24:30,410
<i>TOO LOW TERRAIN</i>

379
00:24:30,726 --> 00:24:32,909
Are we gliding?

380
00:24:33,918 --> 00:24:36,377
We're in glide. Pitch for glide.

381
00:24:42,609 --> 00:24:44,608
<i>One hundred.</i>

382
00:24:49,978 --> 00:24:51,194
<i>Fifty.</i>

383
00:24:53,656 --> 00:24:54,776
<i>Forty.</i>

384
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:56,196
<i>Thirty.</i>

385
00:24:56,683 --> 00:24:57,608
<i>Twenty.</i>

386
00:24:57,796 --> 00:24:59,368
– Brace.
– <i>Ten.</i>

387
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,114
Brace for impact.

388
00:25:15,796 --> 00:25:17,442
I got the pilot.

389
00:25:17,452 --> 00:25:19,746
Somebody, give me a hand here.

390
00:25:20,395 --> 00:25:23,493
Ooh, god, god.

391
00:27:32,213 --> 00:27:34,077
Charlie Anderson?

392
00:27:40,578 --> 00:27:42,357
How you feelin', Whip?

393
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:48,362
Initial reports look like you pulled
some kind of move up there, man.

394
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,478
You saved a lot of lives.

395
00:27:51,597 --> 00:27:52,996
How many?

396
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,662
On the 102 souls on board,

397
00:27:55,669 --> 00:27:58,657
including the flight crew,
96 of them survived the crash.

398
00:28:01,205 --> 00:28:05,361
Six people died.
Two crew, four passengers.

399
00:28:07,331 --> 00:28:09,561
Who... who on the crew?

400
00:28:14,549 --> 00:28:16,679
– Listen. The protocol is-
– Who in the crew, Charlie?

401
00:28:17,115 --> 00:28:19,280
The protocol is that the NTSB has to be

402
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:21,397
the first to make contact
with you, I can't...

403
00:28:22,164 --> 00:28:24,629
And their agent's here, so...

404
00:28:25,491 --> 00:28:27,844
Let me go get him, it's a bit of a show.

405
00:28:28,113 --> 00:28:31,818
So there's... half
a dozen of them. Alright.

406
00:28:35,058 --> 00:28:37,867
Hey Craig. Morning.

407
00:28:50,608 --> 00:28:53,336
Captain William Whitaker?

408
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:56,505
Nod if you can hear me and understand me.

409
00:28:57,025 --> 00:28:59,842
I'm Craig Matson of the NT... NTSB,

410
00:28:59,891 --> 00:29:02,334
and I am required as
the lead on the Go Team

411
00:29:02,342 --> 00:29:04,010
to make initial contact with you,

412
00:29:04,031 --> 00:29:07,135
after a major incident
like the one you had today.

413
00:29:08,401 --> 00:29:11,298
You are in a hospital,
in South Atlanta.

414
00:29:13,343 --> 00:29:17,016
Are you aware that the plane
you were piloting went down?

415
00:29:19,845 --> 00:29:22,843
I have a doctor here who can
explain the medical situation.

416
00:29:23,973 --> 00:29:27,885
I'm Dr. Kenan. And the good news is,
you're in good condition.

417
00:29:28,296 --> 00:29:30,004
You did suffer concussion,

418
00:29:30,091 --> 00:29:32,645
you have numerous lacerations
around your left eye,

419
00:29:32,719 --> 00:29:35,823
we're going to keep the patch on just
for a few days, just as a precaution.

420
00:29:35,849 --> 00:29:38,192
Your eye seems to be okay.

421
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,617
Now the MRI’s show that you
have some strained tendons

422
00:29:40,633 --> 00:29:44,949
in your left knee and ankle,
and you have no broken bones,

423
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,767
but you have some deep bruising
in your left thigh, and some

424
00:29:47,783 --> 00:29:51,112
torn ligaments in your
left wrist. Nothing serious.

425
00:29:51,287 --> 00:29:53,387
So, as soon as we clear your concussion,

426
00:29:53,388 --> 00:29:55,698
and you feel well enough,
you can go home.

427
00:29:55,761 --> 00:29:59,932
That may take a day, maybe three.
Okay?

428
00:30:03,892 --> 00:30:07,930
I won’t ask too much of you
tonight, but as I said,

429
00:30:08,101 --> 00:30:11,888
the NTSB is required
to make initial contact.

430
00:30:13,323 --> 00:30:16,752
How much do you remember about the flight?

431
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,835
Uh, I remember...

432
00:30:23,702 --> 00:30:25,982
I remember everything up to the crash.

433
00:30:26,149 --> 00:30:29,489
Okay... Mr. Whitaker, that’s fine.

434
00:30:30,314 --> 00:30:34,696
I am required to inform you that this
incident did result in the loss of life.

435
00:30:36,576 --> 00:30:41,760
The current information states that
of the 102 souls on board, we lost 6.

436
00:30:42,167 --> 00:30:44,415
Two crew members, and four passengers.

437
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,076
59 people were treated and released.

438
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,447
37 people remain-

439
00:30:48,448 --> 00:30:50,180
– Who died on the crew?

440
00:30:50,505 --> 00:30:56,133
The two flight attendants...
Camelia Satou and Katerina Marquez.

441
00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:02,712
The rep from your Pilot’s Union,
Mr. Anderson, will be our contact for you,

442
00:31:02,728 --> 00:31:07,483
it’s important that you follow your
Union’s guidance on press and media.

443
00:31:08,106 --> 00:31:11,267
The pilot’s union works
closely with the NTSB.

444
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:16,535
So... I’m gonna head out.
Good luck, Mr. Whitaker.

445
00:31:29,474 --> 00:31:32,511
I knew Trina Marquez, she was...

446
00:31:33,714 --> 00:31:35,572
We spent some time together.

447
00:31:35,823 --> 00:31:38,340
Yeah, apparently she was not strapped in.

448
00:31:39,499 --> 00:31:42,454
Survivor reported
she was assisting a kid.

449
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,315
And Margaret Thomason, how's she doing?

450
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:49,859
Broken collarbone. Just, um, cuts,
I mean she's banged up, but she’s...

451
00:31:49,923 --> 00:31:52,023
she's here too, she's fine.

452
00:31:52,649 --> 00:31:55,559
And Ken Evans, your copilot, he-he...

453
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:57,945
he took a bad shot to the head.

454
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,813
And now they’re keepin’ him in a coma
just to let the brain swelling go down,

455
00:32:01,831 --> 00:32:04,988
but we feel good about him.
He’s gonna be okay.

456
00:32:08,271 --> 00:32:10,700
What are you doing here, Charlie?

457
00:32:11,928 --> 00:32:13,540
I’m flying a desk now.

458
00:32:14,088 --> 00:32:16,081
I’m a rep for the pilot's Union.

459
00:32:16,498 --> 00:32:18,076
You’re the rep for the pilots’?

460
00:32:18,133 --> 00:32:21,434
Yeah, I'm the one, and when your plane
went down, all the reps got a page

461
00:32:21,444 --> 00:32:25,144
and I just shot up my hand cause
I know you and said I wanted to

462
00:32:25,157 --> 00:32:27,823
come and be the first face you’d see.

463
00:32:28,394 --> 00:32:30,071
I'm glad you're here.

464
00:32:30,349 --> 00:32:32,978
The Union's gonna release
a statement on your behalf.

465
00:32:33,338 --> 00:32:35,886
Condolences to the families
who lost their loved ones,

466
00:32:35,937 --> 00:32:38,717
gratitude to the brave men
and women of the flight crew.

467
00:32:39,267 --> 00:32:41,458
That's-you don't have to worry about that.

468
00:32:42,517 --> 00:32:45,022
And I know you and Deana have
been divorced for a while now,

469
00:32:45,031 --> 00:32:46,658
but maybe she and your son Will gonna-

470
00:32:46,781 --> 00:32:48,534
Yes, Knuckles...

471
00:32:50,832 --> 00:32:52,563
How old is he now?

472
00:32:52,564 --> 00:32:54,294
Too old. Fifteen.

473
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:56,899
– Fiteen? Wow.
– Yeah.

474
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:00,210
When we flew out for Delta,
you were not even married.

475
00:33:00,843 --> 00:33:03,466
We're dinosaurs, Whip.

476
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,608
Do you want me to reach out to Deana?

477
00:33:08,924 --> 00:33:11,594
And see if... she and Will
want to come down or...?

478
00:33:11,617 --> 00:33:13,071
No, I don't want.

479
00:33:13,673 --> 00:33:15,042
I’ll call her.

480
00:33:15,505 --> 00:33:17,436
Well, speaking of which, I got your phone.

481
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:21,068
And the whole bunch of your
personnal effect from the plane.

482
00:33:21,107 --> 00:33:22,927
Your clothes are toast.

483
00:33:24,828 --> 00:33:26,718
Uh, do you...

484
00:33:27,065 --> 00:33:30,508
Do you need me to...
to get you some stuff?

485
00:33:30,602 --> 00:33:32,598
Nah, 'bout okay.

486
00:33:32,959 --> 00:33:35,365
Charlie, I'm uh...

487
00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:39,533
Damn, I'm glad you came.

488
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:41,937
Okay, too.
I'm happy to be here.

489
00:33:43,815 --> 00:33:48,015
Well, I'm...
I'll let you get some rest and...

490
00:33:48,114 --> 00:33:50,064
but I'll come back, I mean,
you will see plenty of me.

491
00:33:50,072 --> 00:33:51,500
Sure you will.

492
00:33:53,623 --> 00:33:55,691
The plane was fucked, Charlie.

493
00:33:55,714 --> 00:33:57,214
It was doomed.

494
00:33:57,868 --> 00:33:59,589
I know.

495
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:03,822
The way you landed that plane
was nothing short of a miracle.

496
00:34:04,196 --> 00:34:05,596
You know that.

497
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:10,109
Alright, Captain.

498
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:12,419
– Good night.
– Good night.

499
00:35:03,245 --> 00:35:06,062
I'm on the list, baby girl.
Mr. Mays...

500
00:35:06,877 --> 00:35:08,880
Harling.

501
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,654
If this is gonna turn into a sponge bath,
I’ll come back later.

502
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:16,799
Sir...

503
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,408
It's alright, honey. I'm on the list.
Harling Mays.

504
00:35:20,479 --> 00:35:22,578
Some say they Harling knew me.

505
00:35:22,825 --> 00:35:26,657
Honey, could you hustle us a couple
of daiquiris, and a cocktail weenie?

506
00:35:26,721 --> 00:35:29,233
On second thought just bring the
booze, I brought my own weenie.

507
00:35:29,295 --> 00:35:31,330
Ah, well she's offended
and she should be.

508
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:33,563
I’m a pig.
And I hate me.

509
00:35:33,617 --> 00:35:37,598
That’s what we have in common
Nurse Ratched. We both hate me.

510
00:35:39,338 --> 00:35:40,429
Harling Mays.

511
00:35:40,773 --> 00:35:44,858
Whip, what the fuck my man?

512
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:49,509
They’re sayin’, “Sweet Jesus,
what a stud that pilot is.”

513
00:35:49,544 --> 00:35:50,658
You’re a hero, man.

514
00:35:50,861 --> 00:35:54,179
You will never pay for
another drink as long as you live.

515
00:35:54,268 --> 00:35:56,447
There is all kind o' those
crazy news people out here,

516
00:35:56,448 --> 00:35:58,210
it's a fucking circus, man.

517
00:35:58,225 --> 00:36:00,717
Come on, check this shit out,
man, it's all for you.

518
00:36:01,454 --> 00:36:03,209
Look at this shit.

519
00:36:03,475 --> 00:36:05,497
Classic hero worship shit.

520
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:09,785
You're a rock star, man.
Oh, check out this video.

521
00:36:09,837 --> 00:36:12,015
This's outside your condo.
It's a zoo.

522
00:36:12,065 --> 00:36:13,903
It crowded with reporters.

523
00:36:13,934 --> 00:36:14,946
Let's see, check this out.

524
00:36:14,956 --> 00:36:16,307
Let's see, check this out.
<i>So you do know Captain Whitaker,</i>

525
00:36:16,314 --> 00:36:16,909
– <i>you were friends?</i>
– Com'on.

526
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:17,694
<i>Oh yeah.</i>

527
00:36:17,695 --> 00:36:18,825
<i>Yes, he's my brother.</i>

528
00:36:18,841 --> 00:36:19,961
<i>Yes, he's my brother.</i>
– That's me.

529
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:22,873
And that‘s Mark Mellon, you know
that douchey talking haircut from

530
00:36:22,878 --> 00:36:25,274
local Atlanta channel 12?
I said a few words,

531
00:36:25,282 --> 00:36:27,047
you know most of ‘em straight talk.

532
00:36:27,625 --> 00:36:28,745
Oh!

533
00:36:29,165 --> 00:36:30,352
You okay, Captain Whitaker?

534
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,774
The meds they’re giving me,
they're messing me up, I’m all...

535
00:36:32,803 --> 00:36:35,250
shaky and dried out, I can’t sleep good.

536
00:36:35,266 --> 00:36:37,420
Yeah. What the hell kind
of meds they give you?

537
00:36:37,955 --> 00:36:39,482
Alprazolam.

538
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:43,807
That's generic Xanax. Hydroconon,
that's generic Vicodin. It's shit.

539
00:36:43,828 --> 00:36:46,614
Prolly Canadian.
We don't want this shit.

540
00:36:47,013 --> 00:36:50,334
We want the premium stuff, blue label.
Not this fucking well shit.

541
00:36:50,363 --> 00:36:52,696
I mean, where's the...
where’s the dihydromorphinone?

542
00:36:52,699 --> 00:36:54,851
Or at least some fucking
Palladone, for Christ sake,

543
00:36:54,868 --> 00:36:57,717
is this amateur architect doctor in here
you just saved some 100 people-

544
00:36:57,756 --> 00:36:59,821
Harling!

545
00:36:59,941 --> 00:37:01,297
You bring my smokes?

546
00:37:01,393 --> 00:37:04,831
Yes I did, I got your fucking message,
and yes I got your fucking smokes.

547
00:37:05,054 --> 00:37:07,729
Right here...
Here's a fresh carton.

548
00:37:08,029 --> 00:37:09,806
You smoke your nuts off, champion.

549
00:37:09,824 --> 00:37:12,439
Hell if I was you, I'd fire up right
here in the goddamn room.

550
00:37:12,478 --> 00:37:15,592
Here. I got you a pint of vodka,
I got you some Red Bull,

551
00:37:15,601 --> 00:37:17,337
you know what I'm saying,
I know my customer.

552
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:18,519
Take the vodka with you.

553
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,266
What? Take the vodka,
what d'you-

554
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:21,930
I'm not drinking anymore,
take it with you.

555
00:37:21,962 --> 00:37:23,037
Are you ins... I'll just tuck-

556
00:37:23,055 --> 00:37:24,069
– Take the fucking vodka with you.

557
00:37:24,077 --> 00:37:24,950
– Take the fucking vodka with you.
– Okay.

558
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:27,792
Listen mate, you got to
come to get me tomorrow.

559
00:37:27,927 --> 00:37:29,047
Okay?

560
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,352
I want you to go by my condo...

561
00:37:34,853 --> 00:37:38,655
pick me up some clothes,
and uh, my phone charger.

562
00:37:38,819 --> 00:37:42,784
Look in my refrigerator, and pick up
a package that says "veal" on it.

563
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:44,159
– It's marked. Veal.

564
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:44,782
– It's marked. Veal.
– Veal.

565
00:37:44,783 --> 00:37:46,229
In the freezer's, marked veal.

566
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,046
Done and done.
What time you want me here?

567
00:37:48,063 --> 00:37:49,765
– I call you.
– Okay. You give me mayday,

568
00:37:49,777 --> 00:37:51,834
and you’re outta here in 7 minutes.
Oh!

569
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:54,782
Oh, almost forgot,
I got you some stroke mags,

570
00:37:54,844 --> 00:37:56,897
I've been in a hospital before,
I know what you need,

571
00:37:56,947 --> 00:37:59,646
I got Juggs, Hot MILFS in heat,
Assmasters,

572
00:37:59,717 --> 00:38:01,817
you just stroke it all day,
you're a hero.

573
00:38:01,983 --> 00:38:06,024
If I was here, I'd just lay here
pullin'on that thing all day long,

574
00:38:06,025 --> 00:38:09,845
you know what I'm saying,
there's a smile... yessir.

575
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,983
Devious minds think alike.

576
00:39:15,555 --> 00:39:17,332
Don't go.

577
00:39:18,749 --> 00:39:20,839
I'll be quiet, it is...

578
00:39:21,584 --> 00:39:26,051
nice to... just sit and
smoke with somebody.

579
00:39:32,252 --> 00:39:34,147
Were you on that plane?

580
00:39:35,124 --> 00:39:36,363
Yeah, why?

581
00:39:36,787 --> 00:39:37,952
You?

582
00:39:39,185 --> 00:39:41,450
You must have been sittin' at the back.

583
00:39:44,359 --> 00:39:46,605
Yeah... by the back.

584
00:39:47,076 --> 00:39:49,176
<i>Tobacco's but an Indian weed,</i>

585
00:39:49,418 --> 00:39:51,565
<i>Grows green in the morn, cut down at eve</i>

586
00:39:51,588 --> 00:39:54,413
<i>It shows our decay, we are but clay.</i>

587
00:39:55,235 --> 00:39:58,739
Ah, I love the smell
of nicotine in the mornin'!

588
00:40:00,206 --> 00:40:01,797
It smells like victory!

589
00:40:02,781 --> 00:40:04,601
Can't buy more.

590
00:40:08,262 --> 00:40:10,105
I should quit.

591
00:40:10,709 --> 00:40:13,609
My cancer might get cancer.

592
00:40:17,459 --> 00:40:19,138
In the plane crash?

593
00:40:19,139 --> 00:40:20,463
You are...

594
00:40:22,439 --> 00:40:25,499
Holy shit, man!
You're the fucking pilot!

595
00:40:26,532 --> 00:40:29,052
Huh, what happened out there?

596
00:40:29,926 --> 00:40:31,935
Okay.
Yeah, I-hmm...

597
00:40:32,164 --> 00:40:34,153
Tough deal, man, but you, uh...

598
00:40:34,494 --> 00:40:37,066
You walked away.
You limped away.

599
00:40:37,522 --> 00:40:40,902
Yeah, I'm lucky.
Goin’ home tomorrow.

600
00:40:41,036 --> 00:40:42,155
Home...

601
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,035
Home for me is the basement...

602
00:40:44,217 --> 00:40:46,269
They keep cancer treatment
in the basement.

603
00:40:46,607 --> 00:40:48,464
What kind of cancer you have?

604
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:51,843
Fibro-mixzoid sarcoma.
Soft tissue sarcoma.

605
00:40:51,899 --> 00:40:54,233
Very rare. God chose me.

606
00:40:54,984 --> 00:40:57,024
You believe in Him?

607
00:40:57,558 --> 00:41:01,105
Fuck yeah bitch, you’re a stupid
fucker if you don’t believe in God.

608
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:03,812
Once you realize all the
random events in your life are God,

609
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:06,335
you will live a much easier life.

610
00:41:06,729 --> 00:41:10,061
You spend all your time trying to control
all these things that happen to us.

611
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,022
Bullshit.

612
00:41:11,377 --> 00:41:14,133
The plane you’re flying goes down?
Out of your control.

613
00:41:14,168 --> 00:41:16,861
God gives you cancer.
I got no control over that.

614
00:41:17,243 --> 00:41:20,647
Did God give me cancer?
You bet your ass God gave me cancer.

615
00:41:20,735 --> 00:41:23,723
You know, you think God would have
given me cancer if I had asked for it?

616
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:27,610
Well I don't think so, cause I begged him
to take it away, and guess what?

617
00:41:28,966 --> 00:41:31,551
No control over that either.

618
00:41:32,654 --> 00:41:34,221
What are you doing here, honey?

619
00:41:34,432 --> 00:41:36,382
You're beautiful, you know that?

620
00:41:37,605 --> 00:41:39,620
Do I scare you?

621
00:41:40,686 --> 00:41:44,559
People either are drawn to me,
or they pretend that they can’t see me.

622
00:41:46,297 --> 00:41:47,416
It’s a trip...

623
00:41:47,449 --> 00:41:49,363
They think that because I'm
getting close to the other side,

624
00:41:49,385 --> 00:41:51,367
I got some sort of power or wisdom.

625
00:41:51,594 --> 00:41:53,148
Like I got all the answers.

626
00:41:53,305 --> 00:41:55,209
I don't know, maybe I do.

627
00:41:56,218 --> 00:41:58,371
Death gives you perspective.

628
00:41:58,466 --> 00:42:00,035
It all makes sense somehow.

629
00:42:00,176 --> 00:42:02,908
And I just can’t get over
how beautiful you are!

630
00:42:04,416 --> 00:42:06,049
I can see your arm.

631
00:42:06,113 --> 00:42:07,744
You're an addict?

632
00:42:09,486 --> 00:42:10,219
Yeah.

633
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:12,787
What's your name?

634
00:42:13,905 --> 00:42:15,413
Nicole.

635
00:42:16,278 --> 00:42:18,306
What d'you do in the world, Nicole?

636
00:42:18,627 --> 00:42:20,026
Not much.

637
00:42:20,882 --> 00:42:23,426
I was a photographer and
then I was a masseuse,

638
00:42:23,434 --> 00:42:26,790
and now I... I sometimes
wash hair at a salon.

639
00:42:26,845 --> 00:42:28,665
Oh yeah? Where is it?

640
00:42:29,082 --> 00:42:32,775
I will come by, I’m really easy,
you just wash my head.

641
00:42:34,857 --> 00:42:36,835
You think you’re gonna die?

642
00:42:48,453 --> 00:42:50,142
Don’t you just love her?

643
00:42:51,091 --> 00:42:52,326
I don't know her.

644
00:42:52,327 --> 00:42:54,939
Bullshit. I do.

645
00:42:56,061 --> 00:42:57,956
Random Act of God?

646
00:42:58,183 --> 00:43:00,002
I don’t think so.

647
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:04,315
You survive a plane crash and meet
a beautiful woman in a stairwell...

648
00:43:05,292 --> 00:43:07,618
Fuck you, man.

649
00:43:10,341 --> 00:43:12,085
Probably looking for me.

650
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:14,467
My family just flew in from Utah.

651
00:43:14,475 --> 00:43:16,726
You know it’s bad when
they start flying in.

652
00:43:19,493 --> 00:43:21,120
It is a trip.

653
00:43:21,483 --> 00:43:23,940
With every morning special now.

654
00:43:24,425 --> 00:43:26,484
I am greateful for that.

655
00:43:26,689 --> 00:43:29,179
I wish I could bottle
this feelin' that I have...

656
00:43:29,712 --> 00:43:32,658
about how beautiful
every last breath of life is.

657
00:43:36,997 --> 00:43:39,095
Yeah, I get one more just for the road?

658
00:43:39,245 --> 00:43:41,688
Here. Take the pack.

659
00:43:46,381 --> 00:43:47,623
Thank you.

660
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:49,938
I’ll pass these out in the cancer ward.

661
00:43:51,041 --> 00:43:52,288
Nicole...

662
00:43:52,705 --> 00:43:53,921
you’re gonna be okay.

663
00:44:00,791 --> 00:44:02,800
Chemo brain...

664
00:44:03,957 --> 00:44:05,904
It makes you pretty foggy.

665
00:44:05,905 --> 00:44:06,878
Oh, yeah?

666
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:08,850
They call it chemo brain.

667
00:44:09,405 --> 00:44:12,749
My mom, she used to slur
her words and get all chatty.

668
00:44:13,777 --> 00:44:15,529
Your mom had cancer?

669
00:44:16,424 --> 00:44:18,838
Breast cancer, she was only 54.

670
00:44:20,259 --> 00:44:22,461
Is that why you think you gonna die?

671
00:44:24,983 --> 00:44:28,356
Heroin addicts who're usin' needles,
they tend to die.

672
00:44:29,044 --> 00:44:32,904
Especially women for some reason,
I have read in a pamphlet.

673
00:44:34,363 --> 00:44:38,217
A woman from AA, she just came
to see me while I was in rea.

674
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:42,952
That guy was a trip, uh?

675
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:44,146
– Yeah.

676
00:44:44,595 --> 00:44:47,042
He made it feel like, I dunno...

677
00:44:47,869 --> 00:44:51,654
like you and me were
the last people left on this planet.

678
00:44:53,061 --> 00:44:56,815
And together we'll... save the world.

679
00:45:09,032 --> 00:45:10,945
Where d'you live, Nicole?

680
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:14,225
Why, you wanna come to visit me?
It's luxurious.

681
00:45:15,008 --> 00:45:17,266
I live in Bankhead, near the bus station.

682
00:45:17,769 --> 00:45:19,094
I'll come to visit you.

683
00:45:19,306 --> 00:45:20,217
You're sweet.

684
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:21,620
I will.

685
00:45:22,354 --> 00:45:23,900
What’s your address?

686
00:45:25,415 --> 00:45:28,792
I live at the Georgian Terraces...
on Taylor street.

687
00:45:28,819 --> 00:45:29,938
Okay.

688
00:45:30,615 --> 00:45:33,822
You say you're a masseuse.
What kind of masseuse?

689
00:45:34,555 --> 00:45:37,566
I've been every kind of masseuse there is.

690
00:45:40,447 --> 00:45:42,100
Good luck, Nicole.

691
00:45:48,271 --> 00:45:51,896
I couldn't find any suitcases.
I put all your shit in garbage bags.

692
00:45:51,897 --> 00:45:53,141
No, thanks.

693
00:45:56,068 --> 00:45:58,811
You’re stayin’ with me
down on University, right?

694
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:03,685
Hey it’s nice... A lotta young people...
Good vibe.

695
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:07,333
No, I’m gonna go to the farm.

696
00:46:08,141 --> 00:46:10,045
The farm?

697
00:46:10,349 --> 00:46:12,667
I can’t stay at my condo.

698
00:46:13,189 --> 00:46:15,185
I thought you sold your Dad's place.

699
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:16,689
Not yet.

700
00:46:18,713 --> 00:46:21,012
I’m not sure I wanna stay at the farm.

701
00:46:21,217 --> 00:46:24,784
You’re not. You're gonna drive me
to the airport so I can pick-up my car.

702
00:46:26,114 --> 00:46:27,163
Veal?

703
00:46:27,664 --> 00:46:28,783
Really?

704
00:47:44,057 --> 00:47:48,278
<i>Captain Whitaker, this is Jim Court,
I’m with CNN. We'd like to-</i>

705
00:47:48,518 --> 00:47:51,768
<i>This is NBC affiliate in Athens.
We're looking to-</i>

706
00:50:44,226 --> 00:50:47,326
<i>In the wake of the deadly
crash of SouthJet Flight 2-2-7,</i>

707
00:50:47,426 --> 00:50:51,080
<i>we have more questions than answers
as to what exactly happened that day,</i>

708
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:53,443
<i>and like many, we are
around looking for answers.</i>

709
00:50:53,490 --> 00:50:56,840
<i>Looking here at the home of
pilot, captain Whip Whitaker.</i>

710
00:50:57,026 --> 00:50:59,963
<i>Still have no signs of him
coming to his condo....</i>

711
00:50:59,998 --> 00:51:03,382
<i>This is Bart Malles still on the hunt
and looking down for answers.</i>

712
00:51:03,417 --> 00:51:07,446
<i>You’ve reached the Whitaker Crop Dusting
Company, flying lessons and plane rides.</i>

713
00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:11,059
<i>Please leave a message and
it will be returned. Thank you.</i>

714
00:51:12,534 --> 00:51:15,590
<i>Hey, cowboy. Charlie again.</i>

715
00:51:15,707 --> 00:51:19,072
<i>Look, I'm back in town and... I
stopped by at the hospital tonight,</i>

716
00:51:19,082 --> 00:51:23,430
<i>but, uh... they said you'd gone home,
so you must be feeling pretty good.</i>

717
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:27,465
Uh... Listen, I went, uh... at your condo

718
00:51:27,475 --> 00:51:29,863
and the manager said
you had not returned, so...

719
00:51:30,141 --> 00:51:32,346
you maybe with relatives,
which I understand,

720
00:51:32,381 --> 00:51:35,463
but I know you have a doctor's appointment
early in the morning for your eye,

721
00:51:35,483 --> 00:51:38,477
and I was just hoping that
you could meet us for breakfast,

722
00:51:38,903 --> 00:51:42,392
'bout ten o'clock at St Regis,
there is an executive buffet there,

723
00:51:42,572 --> 00:51:45,936
And we'll be covering some
pretty important stuff, so...

724
00:51:46,344 --> 00:51:48,223
it'd be nice to have you there.

725
00:51:48,450 --> 00:51:50,408
Alright. Be good.

726
00:52:16,432 --> 00:52:19,743
Oh, there he is. Hey Whip,
hey buddy. Man, you loog good!

727
00:52:19,763 --> 00:52:21,514
I feel-Thanks for coming,
I'm glad you got my message.

728
00:52:21,546 --> 00:52:23,215
How is your eye?
– Good. Goog, good.

729
00:52:23,272 --> 00:52:25,324
Here's Hugh Lang,
he's an attorney from Chicago.

730
00:52:25,347 --> 00:52:27,046
– Pleasure to meet you, Captain.
– My pleasure.

731
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:29,337
– Sit down. You wanna coffee?
– Uh, yes I do.

732
00:52:29,372 --> 00:52:31,448
Could we have some fresh coffee?

733
00:52:31,747 --> 00:52:35,073
We were just talking about
your copilot’s wife.

734
00:52:35,478 --> 00:52:37,848
She told a newspaper
that “God landed that plane”.

735
00:52:38,083 --> 00:52:40,452
Yeah? God?

736
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:42,103
Well, I too believe God landed the plane,

737
00:52:42,115 --> 00:52:45,235
same way I believe God should hit the
buffet, the turkey sausage is excellent.

738
00:52:45,564 --> 00:52:47,677
No, I’m fine with coffee, thank you.

739
00:52:47,971 --> 00:52:50,246
So Len Caldwell really wanted
to get here this morning,

740
00:52:50,253 --> 00:52:51,719
Len's the president of the pilots’ union,

741
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,695
he wanted to be here to
meet with us, and you,

742
00:52:53,994 --> 00:52:56,110
but they needed him at the crash site.

743
00:52:56,271 --> 00:52:58,065
So as you know, when a plane goes down,

744
00:52:58,081 --> 00:53:01,424
the NTSB sends a “go team”
to the crash site immediately.

745
00:53:01,459 --> 00:53:03,136
They find the flight data recorders?

746
00:53:03,178 --> 00:53:06,792
– They did, it's perfectly intact.
– Oh, great, then that solves everything.

747
00:53:07,167 --> 00:53:10,424
So. Why do we need a lawyer from Chicago?

748
00:53:10,504 --> 00:53:14,141
Well... Hugh specializes
in criminal negligence.

749
00:53:14,188 --> 00:53:16,008
– Criminal negligence?
– Hmm-hmm.

750
00:53:16,386 --> 00:53:18,197
Death demands responsibility.

751
00:53:18,215 --> 00:53:20,578
Six dead on that plane,
someone has to pay.

752
00:53:20,597 --> 00:53:22,965
Yeah, but that's a plane
that fell apart at...

753
00:53:22,966 --> 00:53:24,829
think it fell apart at 30 thousand feet.

754
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:27,419
And the airline will try to
prove equipment failure.

755
00:53:27,519 --> 00:53:30,430
Which is gonna make the manufacturer
responsible, the manufacturer in turn

756
00:53:30,446 --> 00:53:33,232
is gonna try and prove poor maintenance
of the equipment by the airline.

757
00:53:33,258 --> 00:53:34,560
Or pilot error.

758
00:53:36,693 --> 00:53:39,654
I flew the plane inverted,
that means upside down, Hugh.

759
00:53:39,689 --> 00:53:43,491
You get the picture? A hundred people
upside down, 500 feet off the ground.

760
00:53:43,538 --> 00:53:45,394
You have any idea what that's like?

761
00:53:45,498 --> 00:53:48,378
I do. I, uh... heard the
black box recordings last night.

762
00:53:48,405 --> 00:53:50,332
Oh you heard. So you're a pilot?

763
00:53:50,543 --> 00:53:51,472
No, no.

764
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,042
Then you know what the fuck
you're talking about, do you?

765
00:53:53,065 --> 00:53:54,172
Hugh's on our team, Whip.

766
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:55,109
– Is he?
– Yeah, he is,

767
00:53:55,116 --> 00:53:56,216
– He didn' act like he gonna
– obviously...

768
00:53:56,224 --> 00:53:57,537
– have to imagine me questions
– well, he is, yeah but...

769
00:53:57,542 --> 00:53:58,786
– like a fucking pilot,
– Listen to me,

770
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,059
– and that he knows something.
– it's the NTSB's ball game.

771
00:54:00,295 --> 00:54:03,870
They run the investigation, and
they will ultimately rule on the cause.

772
00:54:03,994 --> 00:54:05,885
And that's why we need him.
– Well, they...

773
00:54:06,011 --> 00:54:08,532
interview the entire flight
crew, they...

774
00:54:09,214 --> 00:54:12,195
interview the passengers,
they... hold public hearings.

775
00:54:12,581 --> 00:54:15,508
Hey, let's cut to the chase, what...
just tell me what I need to know, Charlie.

776
00:54:15,511 --> 00:54:20,867
The NTSB 'go-team' also collects
blood, hair, and skin samples

777
00:54:20,872 --> 00:54:24,931
from the entire flight crew for the
purposes of a toxicological report.

778
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,753
Okay... When do they want to do that?

779
00:54:27,949 --> 00:54:30,316
They've already done that.
In the hospital.

780
00:54:30,503 --> 00:54:32,607
That's the first thing they do.

781
00:54:33,568 --> 00:54:35,895
You don't remember having your
blood drawn the night of the crash?

782
00:54:36,083 --> 00:54:37,316
– No.
– No?

783
00:54:42,422 --> 00:54:44,879
They get the results of these...
these tests?

784
00:54:45,043 --> 00:54:46,460
Yeah, they do.

785
00:54:47,507 --> 00:54:48,934
Anything else for you, gentlemen?

786
00:54:48,989 --> 00:54:52,657
Yeah, uh... you have warm
cinnamon bums over there.

787
00:54:52,674 --> 00:54:54,907
Could you give me one of those, please.
In fact give me only two bums.

788
00:54:54,930 --> 00:54:56,328
– Yes sir, comin'up.
– Thank you, sweetie.

789
00:54:56,516 --> 00:54:57,635
Now...

790
00:54:57,991 --> 00:55:00,363
An initial report shows that...

791
00:55:00,401 --> 00:55:05,289
you had alcohol in your system...
uh, at a level of .2 4.

792
00:55:05,313 --> 00:55:07,459
Now...
in the good old U.S.,

793
00:55:07,474 --> 00:55:10,723
a very one of the most lenient
drunk driving countries in the world,

794
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:14,412
you go to jail for driving
with anything above .0 8.

795
00:55:14,584 --> 00:55:17,319
And by driving, I mean a car.

796
00:55:18,028 --> 00:55:19,934
Thank you.
Well...

797
00:55:20,061 --> 00:55:22,480
so that was... don't mean anything,

798
00:55:22,489 --> 00:55:24,417
a couple of beers the
night before the flight,

799
00:55:24,439 --> 00:55:26,112
would that make the tail
of the plane explode?

800
00:55:26,128 --> 00:55:28,524
– Couple of beers?
– Yeah, couple of beers.

801
00:55:28,757 --> 00:55:30,282
You know, I need a lawyer, Charlie.

802
00:55:30,283 --> 00:55:31,923
– Hugh is your lawyer.
– I need a bigger lawyer.

803
00:55:31,924 --> 00:55:34,619
I need a layer that understands that
someone put me on a broken plane,

804
00:55:34,637 --> 00:55:37,579
without me up there, there
would be a 102 funerals, not six.

805
00:55:37,605 --> 00:55:39,384
We're not talking about
funeral right now, Captain.

806
00:55:39,507 --> 00:55:39,921
– Well then, what are we talking about?

807
00:55:39,922 --> 00:55:41,576
– Well then, what are we talking about?
– We're talking about prison time.

808
00:55:42,436 --> 00:55:43,660
– What?
– Lawsuits.

809
00:55:44,757 --> 00:55:45,277
Somebody has to pay.

810
00:55:45,278 --> 00:55:46,650
Somebody has to pay.
– What, I write a check?

811
00:55:46,685 --> 00:55:48,747
I'ts not gonna be me, I promise you that.

812
00:55:48,787 --> 00:55:51,292
As long as they're writing checks,
tell them they write one for me too.

813
00:55:51,608 --> 00:55:55,317
Because someone put me in a broken plane.
I'd love a check, Charlie.

814
00:55:55,386 --> 00:55:58,383
This toxicology report states
that you were drunk.

815
00:55:58,451 --> 00:56:00,851
And high on cocaine.

816
00:56:01,009 --> 00:56:03,580
Felony's punishable by up
to 12 years in prison.

817
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:06,904
And if it is proven that your intoxication
was the cause of the death

818
00:56:06,925 --> 00:56:10,038
of four passengers, now we're gonna
look at four counts of manslaughter.

819
00:56:10,818 --> 00:56:13,129
That could be life in prison.

820
00:56:13,637 --> 00:56:16,870
Now can I please do my job your behalf...

821
00:56:17,825 --> 00:56:20,316
and kill this tox report?

822
00:56:24,718 --> 00:56:26,286
He's gonna get it done, Whip.

823
00:56:26,372 --> 00:56:28,328
He'll get it done, it's what
his whole life's about,

824
00:56:28,329 --> 00:56:30,472
trust me, trust him.

825
00:56:32,589 --> 00:56:34,807
You don't have to worry,
you'll walk away from this-

826
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,304
I am not worried, Charlie.

827
00:56:37,738 --> 00:56:39,858
I promise you that I'm not worried.

828
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:43,117
No one could have landed
that plane like I did.

829
00:56:44,374 --> 00:56:45,901
No one.

830
00:56:52,233 --> 00:56:53,922
– Thanks for coming.
– Yeah.

831
00:56:53,989 --> 00:56:55,821
Excuse me.

832
00:56:57,502 --> 00:56:59,249
– Excuse me.
– Yeah?

833
00:56:59,305 --> 00:57:02,733
Yeah, let me have a...
orange juice, large orange juice.

834
00:57:03,094 --> 00:57:04,872
Just orange juice?

835
00:57:05,333 --> 00:57:06,732
Yeah, uh...

836
00:57:06,842 --> 00:57:08,512
No. Uh...

837
00:57:09,681 --> 00:57:11,006
Double Stoli.

838
00:57:11,484 --> 00:57:12,604
Neat.

839
00:57:12,881 --> 00:57:16,978
<i>.. to me anyway, of a real American hero.
Is that your reading of it?</i>

840
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:21,827
<i>Absolutely. However, remember
every situation is different.</i>

841
00:57:21,872 --> 00:57:25,096
<i>And the actions of the pilots
of SouthJet 2-2-7</i>

842
00:57:25,104 --> 00:57:26,814
<i>will be heavily scrutinized.</i>

843
00:57:26,968 --> 00:57:30,161
<i>Are you suggesting that there may
be more to this that leans behind?</i>

844
00:57:30,162 --> 00:57:34,245
<i>They're all answers. We don't have all of
the answers, we have a lot of questions.</i>

845
00:57:34,276 --> 00:57:37,776
<i>We're gonna have to wait until
some of those answers come in before...</i>

846
00:58:22,968 --> 00:58:25,700
The next morning...

847
00:58:27,355 --> 00:58:29,175
They're not gonna shot me...

848
00:58:30,352 --> 00:58:33,247
Aah, Taylor street.

849
00:59:22,390 --> 00:59:23,208
<i>Get out.</i>

850
00:59:23,209 --> 00:59:26,480
<i>The guy in Unit 1 just told me
you stayed here last night!</i>

851
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:31,717
<i>What about my rent?
You owe me money, bitch.</i>

852
00:59:31,805 --> 00:59:33,677
– Don't touch me, Fran.
– Listen, I'm gonna...

853
00:59:33,701 --> 00:59:36,722
– Fuck, you will listen to me...
– Fran, get off me Frankie, you're...

854
00:59:37,345 --> 00:59:39,428
.. the fuck are you doin'?
Fuck off, man.

855
00:59:39,452 --> 00:59:42,043
Keep your fucking hands off her!

856
00:59:46,802 --> 00:59:48,810
Are you okay?

857
00:59:49,885 --> 00:59:52,449
Sorry, is this... is this
all the rest of your stuff?

858
00:59:52,818 --> 00:59:53,748
Uh, yeah.

859
00:59:53,897 --> 00:59:55,764
She still owe me 1100 dollars.

860
00:59:55,865 --> 00:59:57,953
Plus damages...
– Get out!

861
00:59:59,887 --> 01:00:01,807
What, you wanna sue her?

862
01:00:01,870 --> 01:00:05,173
Spend a 1000 bucks, or you wanna make
a cash deal with me? Make up your mind.

863
01:00:05,956 --> 01:00:07,429
Make up your mind!

864
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:11,106
I take 700 cash.

865
01:00:12,118 --> 01:00:14,225
You're a hairy little creep, aren't you?

866
01:00:14,748 --> 01:00:16,727
Baseball bat bullshit.

867
01:00:20,985 --> 01:00:24,494
700 my ass. Here's 400 cash.

868
01:00:24,608 --> 01:00:26,666
Now be a good boy.

869
01:00:26,895 --> 01:00:29,532
Grab that box, put it in her car.

870
01:00:29,689 --> 01:00:31,968
Uh... but my car don’t run.

871
01:00:32,101 --> 01:00:34,921
It didn't start this morning,
I'm taking all this with me.

872
01:00:35,326 --> 01:00:37,127
– Your car doesn't run?
– Hmm-hmm.

873
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:40,217
Well, what you're gonna do?

874
01:00:40,976 --> 01:00:42,376
Well I...

875
01:00:43,591 --> 01:00:46,043
I don't know what I was gonna do.

876
01:01:12,146 --> 01:01:13,970
What's your name?

877
01:01:14,423 --> 01:01:15,601
Whip.

878
01:01:20,289 --> 01:01:22,082
What?

879
01:01:23,032 --> 01:01:25,225
That's funny?

880
01:01:31,275 --> 01:01:32,583
Thank you.

881
01:01:33,717 --> 01:01:35,295
Captain Whip.

882
01:01:51,238 --> 01:01:52,190
You Okay?

883
01:01:52,495 --> 01:01:54,609
– Yeah. And you?
– Yeah.

884
01:01:54,855 --> 01:01:57,300
– You wan' a drink?
– No, thanks.

885
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:02,364
Sure it's alright that I stay here?

886
01:02:02,451 --> 01:02:05,455
– Yes, it's alright that you stay here.

887
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:07,976
I want you to stay.

888
01:02:10,252 --> 01:02:11,906
That knee hurtin' you?

889
01:02:12,656 --> 01:02:15,309
Yes is it.
Yes, sweetie.

890
01:02:22,129 --> 01:02:24,442
Thank you, Doctor.

891
01:02:26,533 --> 01:02:29,098
– It’s throbbing within...
– Yeah.

892
01:02:29,099 --> 01:02:32,676
Cos it's having a hard time
getting back to your heart.

893
01:02:41,369 --> 01:02:43,569
That's good though.

894
01:04:00,442 --> 01:04:02,770
You gonna shoot me?

895
01:04:02,771 --> 01:04:05,188
Or can I come inside?

896
01:04:05,189 --> 01:04:08,195
Yeah, come on inside, I shoot you inside.

897
01:04:10,962 --> 01:04:15,068
Listen, I... I thought we'd take a ride,
there's some I need to show you.

898
01:04:17,264 --> 01:04:18,663
I'm good.

899
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:26,357
There it is.

900
01:04:27,652 --> 01:04:32,266
You can see... on initial impact,
the left wing hit the ground.

901
01:04:32,766 --> 01:04:34,468
I think if it would have
sheared off completely,

902
01:04:34,469 --> 01:04:36,205
everybody would have walked
away from this plane.

903
01:04:36,967 --> 01:04:39,441
Wing snapped off and it jaw opened the...

904
01:04:40,006 --> 01:04:43,948
engine cowling into the... rear fuselage.

905
01:04:43,987 --> 01:04:45,107
Yeah.

906
01:04:45,146 --> 01:04:48,026
If you were sitting in the last
six or seven rows it was...

907
01:04:48,113 --> 01:04:49,815
like being hit by a train.

908
01:04:51,131 --> 01:04:52,184
Who are they?

909
01:04:52,249 --> 01:04:55,102
The John the Baptist Pentecoastal Mission.

910
01:04:55,262 --> 01:04:57,212
They helped pull survivors
out of the wreckage.

911
01:04:57,213 --> 01:04:59,566
Now they come out here every day.

912
01:05:08,195 --> 01:05:11,413
And that is Ellen Block.

913
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:13,744
She is the head of the NTSB investigation.

914
01:05:13,745 --> 01:05:16,778
She's the one that's gonna be
asking you the tough questions.

915
01:05:17,302 --> 01:05:20,042
I night the night before the flight.
I drank that morning too,

916
01:05:20,051 --> 01:05:22,505
I used cocaine to help
straighten myself up.

917
01:05:23,355 --> 01:05:25,916
I know.
It's in the toxicology report.

918
01:05:25,917 --> 01:05:28,663
And it's not the reason why this happened.

919
01:05:29,219 --> 01:05:30,898
No, it's not.

920
01:05:32,052 --> 01:05:33,172
Listen.

921
01:05:34,199 --> 01:05:37,008
Clearly there was a mechanical
issue with the plane.

922
01:05:37,078 --> 01:05:39,412
– Clearly.
– Yeah. But what you and I know...

923
01:05:40,193 --> 01:05:42,489
This was an "Act of God".

924
01:05:43,631 --> 01:05:46,601
And I'm gonna fight to get
the NTSB to add "Act of God"

925
01:05:46,602 --> 01:05:49,479
as one of the probable causes.

926
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:52,282
Who’s God would do this?

927
01:06:03,462 --> 01:06:07,412
Here’s the deal. Avington Carr,
is the owner of the airline,

928
01:06:07,436 --> 01:06:11,107
He's on our side.
He's got big friends in Washington too.

929
01:06:11,930 --> 01:06:14,859
He wants to have a sit down with us
tomorrow morning at ten o'clock.

930
01:06:15,536 --> 01:06:17,356
– Really?
– Yeah.

931
01:06:17,961 --> 01:06:19,928
You can't drink, Captain.

932
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:24,971
You're under the microscope right now.
You can't be seen buy a liquor.

933
01:06:25,113 --> 01:06:27,805
That means no bars... no drugs.

934
01:06:27,829 --> 01:06:30,086
– I understand. I won't drink,
I promise you.

935
01:06:30,797 --> 01:06:32,521
– Look, we can get you help...
– I don't need help-

936
01:06:32,529 --> 01:06:34,372
I won't drink, I promise you.

937
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:37,270
I can stop. On my own.

938
01:06:37,831 --> 01:06:39,651
– Okay.
– Okay.

939
01:06:43,779 --> 01:06:45,942
– So ten O'clock-
– Ten O'clock, I got it.

940
01:06:45,943 --> 01:06:47,813
Avington Car.

941
01:06:48,313 --> 01:06:50,818
I never wanted that fucking airline.

942
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:54,008
Neither did my brother.
It was my father that wanted it.

943
01:06:54,194 --> 01:06:55,495
I like baseball.

944
01:06:55,618 --> 01:06:56,815
– Oh, I like baseball.
– Everyone likes to watch baseball.

945
01:06:56,956 --> 01:06:58,493
Everybody enjoys to like baseball.

946
01:06:58,494 --> 01:06:59,804
– The whole country likes baseball.

947
01:06:59,805 --> 01:07:01,076
– The whole country likes baseball.
– Cut the crap.

948
01:07:02,281 --> 01:07:04,794
So... what's the deal, Lenny?

949
01:07:04,919 --> 01:07:07,396
Is your union gonna survive this one?

950
01:07:07,691 --> 01:07:11,063
More importantly, how big a check
you think I’m gonna have to write?

951
01:07:11,075 --> 01:07:13,635
Well, you had six fatalities
on board your aircraft.

952
01:07:13,667 --> 01:07:16,491
No no, it's four, Lenny.
The two crew members don't count.

953
01:07:19,097 --> 01:07:20,422
I don't mean they don't count.

954
01:07:20,423 --> 01:07:22,584
They don't get settlements
like the passengers.

955
01:07:22,694 --> 01:07:25,764
Yeah, that’s a workman’s comp claim,
part of the union contract.

956
01:07:26,207 --> 01:07:29,283
They do dangerous job, they know it.

957
01:07:29,837 --> 01:07:31,842
You’re the lawyer for the pilots’ union?

958
01:07:31,858 --> 01:07:35,214
No sir, this is Hugh Lang, he's
the attorney we brought on

959
01:07:35,223 --> 01:07:37,798
to handle the criminal side of
Captain Whitaker’s situation.

960
01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:42,678
Yes, and what is Mr. Whitaker's situation?

961
01:07:43,070 --> 01:07:47,027
NTSB is up my ass with a flashlight,
we had to give them access to everything.

962
01:07:47,330 --> 01:07:49,378
Everbody's curious about Captain Whitaker.

963
01:07:49,421 --> 01:07:52,590
Well I flew with him in the Navy
and he is a great pilot.

964
01:07:52,817 --> 01:07:53,936
Huh.

965
01:07:55,178 --> 01:07:56,574
Is he a drunk?

966
01:08:00,602 --> 01:08:03,264
He's a heavy drinker.
But maybe I should bring in him?

967
01:08:03,288 --> 01:08:04,688
In a minute.

968
01:08:05,341 --> 01:08:07,779
Alright, so let’s get down to it, Lenny.

969
01:08:08,207 --> 01:08:11,939
What does the union plan to do
about this blood test saying

970
01:08:12,176 --> 01:08:14,797
Whitaker was high on booze and coke?

971
01:08:15,104 --> 01:08:16,586
This guy’s a real peach.

972
01:08:16,802 --> 01:08:18,979
I'm gonna kill the toxicology report.

973
01:08:20,042 --> 01:08:22,944
The testing was done incompetently.

974
01:08:22,962 --> 01:08:28,024
The toxicology equipment they used
was last calibrated in June of 2009.

975
01:08:28,174 --> 01:08:30,754
It's already 18 months past code.

976
01:08:31,028 --> 01:08:35,150
Their log that should clearly state
who labeled the blood vials and when,

977
01:08:35,167 --> 01:08:39,109
is very incomplete, and they used a
preservative in the blood

978
01:08:39,182 --> 01:08:41,921
that has been known to cause fermentation,

979
01:08:42,161 --> 01:08:45,239
and in some cases register
higher in an alcohol test.

980
01:08:45,249 --> 01:08:48,881
Now, I have done all this, I've
only been here a few days. So...

981
01:08:48,938 --> 01:08:51,155
I wouldn't worry about it too much,
I can handle this.

982
01:08:51,652 --> 01:08:53,073
I like this guy, Lenny.

983
01:08:53,284 --> 01:08:56,268
Makes me wanna go out
sniff a few lines and fly a jet.

984
01:08:56,660 --> 01:08:57,776
Mr. Carr,

985
01:08:57,777 --> 01:09:01,750
we’re gonna fight to push all the fault
on the manufacturer, Jackson Ridgefield.

986
01:09:01,896 --> 01:09:05,361
And you think they’re gonna just open
their check book and buy us all lunch?

987
01:09:05,705 --> 01:09:07,391
Good fucking luck.

988
01:09:08,084 --> 01:09:09,554
What’s my exposure Jim?

989
01:09:10,930 --> 01:09:13,622
Well, the awards to the
families could kill the airline.

990
01:09:13,644 --> 01:09:14,782
Fuck the airline.

991
01:09:14,804 --> 01:09:16,904
The insurance companies
can have the goddamm airline.

992
01:09:16,998 --> 01:09:19,137
I just don’t want them come
sniffing in my other pockets.

993
01:09:19,162 --> 01:09:23,401
Speaking for the pilots’ union, sir,
we don’t want to see your airline go away.

994
01:09:23,402 --> 01:09:25,308
We enjoy the contract you have with us.

995
01:09:25,653 --> 01:09:29,041
We gonna protect Captain Whitaker,
and in turn we gonna protect your airline.

996
01:09:30,063 --> 01:09:33,675
Does... Whitaker know he's goin' to jail?

997
01:09:34,345 --> 01:09:36,415
My client isn't goin' to jail, Mr. Carr.

998
01:09:36,454 --> 01:09:39,253
Oh, he's goin' to jail.
He belongs in jail.

999
01:09:39,363 --> 01:09:42,103
Bet your ass he's goin' to jail,
the only question is...

1000
01:09:42,159 --> 01:09:44,192
is he gonna die in jail?

1001
01:09:44,193 --> 01:09:46,226
You are wrong, Mr. Carr.

1002
01:09:46,589 --> 01:09:49,811
Last time I checked, six counts
of manslaughter, it's life in prison.

1003
01:09:50,539 --> 01:09:52,129
Life in prison...

1004
01:09:52,567 --> 01:09:55,785
What we in Georgia call “all day long”.

1005
01:10:03,717 --> 01:10:05,949
I hear you're some kind o' pilot.

1006
01:10:32,697 --> 01:10:35,554
Theeere she is, there she is.

1007
01:10:35,585 --> 01:10:39,615
Back to the meet?
Had a nice meeting?

1008
01:10:42,629 --> 01:10:45,014
I know, it's okay, uh?

1009
01:10:48,618 --> 01:10:50,017
It's okay...

1010
01:10:50,784 --> 01:10:52,666
Yup, that's it.

1011
01:10:59,122 --> 01:11:00,242
Me?

1012
01:11:02,286 --> 01:11:03,685
That's it.

1013
01:11:04,806 --> 01:11:07,204
Am I-No.
Yeah, no.

1014
01:11:17,082 --> 01:11:20,001
<i>You wanna run the boy, you wanna be
a quarterback, let me see you run it back!</i>

1015
01:11:20,275 --> 01:11:22,805
<i>So say "Dowdow", say "Kwakwa"!</i>

1016
01:12:53,397 --> 01:12:55,859
– Good morning.
– Hello.

1017
01:13:00,888 --> 01:13:03,143
You were in really
bad shape last night.

1018
01:13:03,229 --> 01:13:06,345
Yeah, true...
just tired.

1019
01:13:09,064 --> 01:13:11,725
Drank a little bit too much.

1020
01:13:11,945 --> 01:13:13,064
A bit?

1021
01:13:14,652 --> 01:13:17,345
What, you won't count the fucking beers?

1022
01:13:17,514 --> 01:13:19,022
I threw ‘em out.

1023
01:13:20,123 --> 01:13:21,948
They're in the garbage, vodka too.

1024
01:13:23,928 --> 01:13:25,507
Is that okay with you?

1025
01:13:25,751 --> 01:13:26,970
More than okay.

1026
01:13:31,954 --> 01:13:34,826
I’ve been watching the sky
change as the sun rises.

1027
01:13:36,924 --> 01:13:38,507
Beautiful.

1028
01:13:39,373 --> 01:13:42,286
I went out there, I took some great shots.

1029
01:13:47,048 --> 01:13:49,802
It's just so beautiful here.

1030
01:13:50,616 --> 01:13:52,246
You grew up here?

1031
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:54,595
No, Dad did.

1032
01:13:57,610 --> 01:13:59,778
It's my grandfather's farm.

1033
01:14:02,648 --> 01:14:03,677
Was.

1034
01:14:05,465 --> 01:14:09,955
Dad was a pilot, he was a...
332nd airbone. He was a...

1035
01:14:10,205 --> 01:14:12,852
Tuskee, he built that
landing strip out there.

1036
01:14:14,537 --> 01:14:19,596
Crop dustin'. EPA shut him down, he...
traded the crop duster for...

1037
01:14:20,334 --> 01:14:23,699
that old Cesna sittin'
out there in the barn.

1038
01:14:25,849 --> 01:14:29,510
He flew that damn thing
all over the place.

1039
01:14:32,191 --> 01:14:35,806
He died... I got divorced, and...

1040
01:14:38,522 --> 01:14:41,035
been trying to sell the place ever since.

1041
01:14:43,422 --> 01:14:45,192
What about your mom?

1042
01:14:45,701 --> 01:14:47,028
Dead.

1043
01:14:49,646 --> 01:14:51,260
You? What about your Dad?

1044
01:14:52,039 --> 01:14:54,841
Well, I'm pretty sure he...
lives in Colorado.

1045
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:56,110
Yeah?

1046
01:14:57,377 --> 01:14:58,851
No relationship?

1047
01:14:59,724 --> 01:15:01,835
It was my mom that raised me.

1048
01:15:01,836 --> 01:15:03,363
She was incredible.

1049
01:15:04,835 --> 01:15:08,489
She held it together for so long,
I couldn’t tell how sick she was.

1050
01:15:11,119 --> 01:15:14,461
We spent those last seven months
together like we were teenagers.

1051
01:15:16,806 --> 01:15:20,948
We traded stories about
boys and... whatever.

1052
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:26,121
Oh, she loved me.

1053
01:15:43,535 --> 01:15:45,181
My name's Trevor.

1054
01:15:45,673 --> 01:15:47,995
You saved my mom.

1055
01:16:00,114 --> 01:16:01,583
– It's great to see you, Whip.

1056
01:16:01,584 --> 01:16:03,454
– It's great to see you, Whip.
– It's good to see you too.

1057
01:16:09,579 --> 01:16:11,319
The service was so nice.

1058
01:16:11,429 --> 01:16:14,125
I mean, all those people
who wanted to say goodbye.

1059
01:16:16,165 --> 01:16:19,350
And Trina looked so beautiful in there.
Don't you think you?

1060
01:16:20,047 --> 01:16:23,692
I mean, like she was gonna...
wake up and smile!

1061
01:16:23,996 --> 01:16:27,384
I didn’t go in, Margaret.
I... I just couldn’t.

1062
01:16:28,806 --> 01:16:29,897
Trevor...

1063
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:33,803
Find daddy, baby.
He's over there with Mr. Benton.

1064
01:16:40,858 --> 01:16:43,135
You really should come
to the counseling group.

1065
01:16:43,293 --> 01:16:45,439
The Union has great
people for us to talk to.

1066
01:16:45,465 --> 01:16:47,798
I can't.
Really I...

1067
01:16:48,829 --> 01:16:49,949
I will.

1068
01:16:53,349 --> 01:16:55,379
– Yeah. Well...
– Margaret.

1069
01:16:57,169 --> 01:16:58,271
– You take care, okay, Whip?

1070
01:16:58,272 --> 01:16:59,143
– You take care, okay, Whip?
– Okay.

1071
01:16:59,799 --> 01:17:01,986
Listen, Margaret, I have a...

1072
01:17:03,897 --> 01:17:06,249
You know, I'm in
the middle of this, uh...

1073
01:17:07,272 --> 01:17:10,824
investigation. The NTSB
is investigating the crash.

1074
01:17:10,854 --> 01:17:12,504
Yeah, I'm gonna talk to ‘em next week.

1075
01:17:12,522 --> 01:17:16,307
Yeah. Well, I-I-
I'm a little nervous because...

1076
01:17:17,514 --> 01:17:21,263
I was out the night
before the crash, the diner-

1077
01:17:21,293 --> 01:17:22,230
Yeah. With Katerina.

1078
01:17:22,272 --> 01:17:26,827
Right. And I had two glasses of wine,
and they're probably gonna ask you

1079
01:17:26,936 --> 01:17:29,487
about my condition that morning, or

1080
01:17:29,488 --> 01:17:32,288
whether you thought
I had anything to drink.

1081
01:17:35,833 --> 01:17:37,280
What?

1082
01:17:40,416 --> 01:17:42,359
I've known you eleven years, Whip.

1083
01:17:42,445 --> 01:17:43,300
Right.

1084
01:17:43,582 --> 01:17:48,013
You want to tell me that you and Trina went
to diner and you had two glasses of wine,

1085
01:17:48,022 --> 01:17:50,066
sounds like a nice restaurant,
now which one was it?

1086
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:53,000
You have to say that it was
an ordinary day, Margaret.

1087
01:17:53,021 --> 01:17:56,569
I mean, it was an ordinary day.
You know me, I was in shape to fly.

1088
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:03,578
You have a problem saying that?

1089
01:18:05,315 --> 01:18:08,101
It's a lie, Whip... It's a lie.

1090
01:18:08,239 --> 01:18:10,745
Trina told me you two
hadn't been to sleep.

1091
01:18:10,785 --> 01:18:13,336
Well, the... my lack of
sleep had nothing to do

1092
01:18:13,353 --> 01:18:15,469
with that plane falling apart, Margaret.

1093
01:18:15,865 --> 01:18:18,337
I'm just trying to get these things
straight, now you think any other pilot

1094
01:18:18,338 --> 01:18:20,291
could have landed that plane
and saved more lives?

1095
01:18:20,304 --> 01:18:21,226
I didn't say that, Whip,

1096
01:18:21,242 --> 01:18:22,362
– Alright, then...
– I can't imagine another pilot...

1097
01:18:22,383 --> 01:18:26,747
Imagine your son Trevor in this
church looking at you in that box,

1098
01:18:26,756 --> 01:18:30,035
or my son visiting me in prison,
and for the next forty years-

1099
01:18:30,046 --> 01:18:32,333
Please, Whip, enough.
Enough, Whip.

1100
01:18:32,358 --> 01:18:34,541
Don't you think we've all had enough?

1101
01:18:42,345 --> 01:18:44,108
I need this, Margaret.

1102
01:18:51,624 --> 01:18:53,582
What d'you want me to say?

1103
01:18:55,526 --> 01:18:56,953
I just...

1104
01:18:58,527 --> 01:19:00,203
It was an ordinary day.

1105
01:19:02,860 --> 01:19:06,388
The storm... after we took off...

1106
01:19:06,699 --> 01:19:08,692
was very severe.

1107
01:19:09,954 --> 01:19:12,950
But as far as the flight crew
is concerned, it was a...

1108
01:19:13,873 --> 01:19:15,973
a perfectly ordinary day.

1109
01:19:42,423 --> 01:19:43,772
You okay?

1110
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:45,490
Uh yeah, yeah.

1111
01:19:46,289 --> 01:19:47,702
So?

1112
01:19:47,904 --> 01:19:50,604
Well, I got through the first day,
they didn-t fire me,

1113
01:19:50,667 --> 01:19:52,066
so...
– Then?

1114
01:19:52,286 --> 01:19:55,221
And they need someone to work
the night shift, and they asked me,

1115
01:19:55,328 --> 01:19:57,400
it’s time and a half so...

1116
01:19:59,006 --> 01:20:00,816
I got a vest...

1117
01:20:01,629 --> 01:20:03,863
and a... well, name tag,
I got you something.

1118
01:20:03,962 --> 01:20:05,782
– Yeah?
– Yeah.

1119
01:20:05,876 --> 01:20:07,276
Thank you.

1120
01:20:10,028 --> 01:20:11,010
– It is a P-51 mustang.

1121
01:20:11,011 --> 01:20:12,447
– It is a P-51 mustang.
– I know it's a P-51.

1122
01:20:12,478 --> 01:20:13,175
– Your daddy fly one of these?

1123
01:20:13,176 --> 01:20:14,188
– Your daddy fly one of these?
– Yes, he did.

1124
01:20:15,576 --> 01:20:17,518
It cause for celebration.

1125
01:20:17,544 --> 01:20:20,760
Oh well, I promised Sheila that
I'd go to this AA meeting now.

1126
01:20:21,204 --> 01:20:23,027
She's my sponsor, the one
that's been helping me,

1127
01:20:23,030 --> 01:20:24,456
can we celebrate tomorrow night?

1128
01:20:25,442 --> 01:20:26,541
Yeah.

1129
01:20:27,282 --> 01:20:29,127
Yeah sure, why not?

1130
01:20:32,937 --> 01:20:35,891
You know, you can come with me...
to the meeting.

1131
01:20:36,132 --> 01:20:38,763
It's an open meeting,
meaning that anyone can come.

1132
01:20:39,665 --> 01:20:40,706
Even you!

1133
01:20:42,515 --> 01:20:44,871
So the cops got a flashlight on
me behind the dumpster, I'm...

1134
01:20:44,890 --> 01:20:46,589
I'm wearing nothing but
my girlfriend’s panties,

1135
01:20:46,603 --> 01:20:48,663
I got vomitin' on the
front of my chest,

1136
01:20:49,515 --> 01:20:53,295
and I say to him:
"Uh... I might have had two beers."

1137
01:21:00,355 --> 01:21:02,873
So that's why I get the nickname:
"Two-Beer Barry".

1138
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:08,429
I'm getting the, uh... the
stink eye from Ed over here,

1139
01:21:08,445 --> 01:21:10,030
have I gone off format?

1140
01:21:11,328 --> 01:21:13,653
My name is Barry and I'm an alcoholic.

1141
01:21:13,779 --> 01:21:15,060
Hi Barry.

1142
01:21:15,119 --> 01:21:18,201
Are there any other alcoholics present?

1143
01:21:23,510 --> 01:21:26,600
I always love a meeting where
we all have to identify the tab,

1144
01:21:26,609 --> 01:21:30,097
because it forces me to be
honest about who I really am.

1145
01:21:31,734 --> 01:21:36,286
And I never told the truth out there,
obviously I lied about everything.

1146
01:21:37,787 --> 01:21:40,826
I was told in these rooms that
I was never sober if I kept lying,

1147
01:21:40,834 --> 01:21:42,578
but that's what I was best at.

1148
01:21:45,285 --> 01:21:47,572
If I knew anything in this
world, it was how to lie,

1149
01:21:47,579 --> 01:21:50,897
especially about my drinking.
But...

1150
01:21:51,107 --> 01:21:54,330
whatever, I would lie about
the name of my dog,

1151
01:21:54,331 --> 01:21:57,593
I'd lie about the color of my
own hair right to your face.

1152
01:21:59,269 --> 01:22:04,492
My whole life just became... a series
of lies, strung together by me,

1153
01:22:04,513 --> 01:22:05,893
I gotta go.

1154
01:22:06,299 --> 01:22:07,419
Sure.

1155
01:22:07,891 --> 01:22:10,529
Oh yeah, Sheila, she can
give me a ride, does she?

1156
01:22:11,208 --> 01:22:12,328
I'm Sheila.

1157
01:22:32,608 --> 01:22:36,300
<i>I’ve been speaking to some people who
are very close to the NTSB investigation,</i>

1158
01:22:36,310 --> 01:22:39,589
<i>and they are confident they will
soon be able to determine exactly</i>

1159
01:22:39,591 --> 01:22:41,189
<i>what brought this plane down.</i>

1160
01:22:41,196 --> 01:22:43,765
<i>I'm sure they will, sir.</i>

1161
01:22:43,766 --> 01:22:46,786
<i>Well, Ken and Vicki Evans,
thank you very much.</i>

1162
01:22:46,802 --> 01:22:49,682
<i>Thank you sir. God bless you.</i>

1163
01:23:01,982 --> 01:23:04,238
How you feeling, Ken?

1164
01:23:06,001 --> 01:23:07,709
I'm happy to be alive.

1165
01:23:07,791 --> 01:23:09,981
Blessed... to be alive.

1166
01:23:12,317 --> 01:23:15,266
I'm Captain Whitaker, I was...
flying the-

1167
01:23:15,277 --> 01:23:16,663
I know who you are.

1168
01:23:18,112 --> 01:23:21,421
Excuse me. Can you give us
some privacy, please?

1169
01:23:21,492 --> 01:23:23,005
Thank you.

1170
01:23:34,420 --> 01:23:36,527
So, uh...

1171
01:23:36,785 --> 01:23:38,605
How long have you been out of the...

1172
01:23:38,968 --> 01:23:40,807
– Out of the coma?
– Yeah.

1173
01:23:41,624 --> 01:23:43,019
Two days.

1174
01:23:47,766 --> 01:23:51,388
Well, uh, look, I don't wanna...
disrupt your whole day,

1175
01:23:52,318 --> 01:23:57,159
God knows you've been...
swamped by interviews, and...

1176
01:23:58,714 --> 01:24:01,648
You looked brillant on the CNN,
by the way.

1177
01:24:02,218 --> 01:24:05,880
Both my legs are crushed.
My pelvis is snapped.

1178
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:11,283
I'll probably never walk again.
Al least not without a walker or braces.

1179
01:24:12,368 --> 01:24:14,569
I'll certainly never fly again.

1180
01:24:15,778 --> 01:24:17,374
I'm very sorry, Ken.

1181
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:21,331
That plane was doomed
the moment you sat in that cockpit.

1182
01:24:22,083 --> 01:24:25,124
You reeked like gin or somethin’.

1183
01:24:25,549 --> 01:24:28,349
I called Vicki from the plane
before we took off.

1184
01:24:29,766 --> 01:24:32,277
That’s when the rain kicked up.

1185
01:24:33,651 --> 01:24:37,703
Well, I don’t know how much
you remember, but...

1186
01:24:38,326 --> 01:24:39,894
that plane...

1187
01:24:40,363 --> 01:24:42,199
it started falling apart, Ken.

1188
01:24:42,349 --> 01:24:45,041
I remember everything until the crash.

1189
01:24:45,326 --> 01:24:46,931
I know what went wrong.

1190
01:24:49,306 --> 01:24:52,318
What are you trying to say, Ken?
What do we talk?

1191
01:24:53,253 --> 01:24:56,500
I do not know, Captain Whitaker.
What are we talking about?

1192
01:24:56,528 --> 01:24:59,772
I'm just trying to get a sense from you...

1193
01:25:00,773 --> 01:25:04,574
about what you thought caused the crash.

1194
01:25:05,873 --> 01:25:09,870
Was it the fact that you got on the
plane still drunk from the night before?

1195
01:25:11,717 --> 01:25:15,746
The NTSB is coming back tomorrow
to finish taking a deposition from me...

1196
01:25:16,952 --> 01:25:18,800
about the events on that flight.

1197
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:23,370
Do you think you... be alive
if I wasn't flying that plane?

1198
01:25:24,629 --> 01:25:25,634
No.

1199
01:25:26,662 --> 01:25:28,319
We'd all be dead.

1200
01:25:29,084 --> 01:25:32,940
But you gonna argue with me
that your physical state was tip-top?

1201
01:25:38,494 --> 01:25:39,744
Wait.

1202
01:25:40,393 --> 01:25:41,578
Sit...

1203
01:25:42,351 --> 01:25:43,664
Please.

1204
01:25:49,353 --> 01:25:52,248
I never shared my opinion
about your physical state...

1205
01:25:52,655 --> 01:25:54,482
the morning of the flight.

1206
01:25:55,489 --> 01:25:56,915
I never said a word.

1207
01:25:59,448 --> 01:26:01,665
That crash was pre-ordained.

1208
01:26:03,069 --> 01:26:04,949
I prayed on it, Captain.

1209
01:26:05,130 --> 01:26:07,176
Vicky and I both prayed on it.

1210
01:26:08,016 --> 01:26:09,479
There's only one judge, sir.

1211
01:26:09,597 --> 01:26:10,932
Praise Jesus!

1212
01:26:11,144 --> 01:26:13,251
And he's got a higher plan for you.

1213
01:26:14,338 --> 01:26:18,531
This event... although it's
tragic in his loss of life...

1214
01:26:20,515 --> 01:26:22,817
it's also a celebration of life.

1215
01:26:23,828 --> 01:26:26,708
Nothing happens in the kingdom
of the Lord by mistake, sir.

1216
01:26:26,710 --> 01:26:28,324
Praise Jesus!

1217
01:26:28,415 --> 01:26:29,728
Captain...

1218
01:26:30,961 --> 01:26:32,420
Will you pray with us?

1219
01:26:44,769 --> 01:26:48,818
Jesus, our Savior, we thank you
for blessing Captain Whitaker.

1220
01:26:48,819 --> 01:26:52,196
For guiding his hand
on that fateful morning.

1221
01:26:53,438 --> 01:26:55,114
– Bye.
– It's on the right.

1222
01:26:55,173 --> 01:26:57,106
– Thanks for the ride.
– Okay.

1223
01:27:21,333 --> 01:27:22,857
Oh hey, look.

1224
01:27:23,678 --> 01:27:25,244
Great, ain't it?

1225
01:27:25,406 --> 01:27:26,432
It's kind of beautiful.

1226
01:27:26,433 --> 01:27:28,215
It is beautiful, I know, like you.

1227
01:27:28,249 --> 01:27:30,473
– Does it work?
– Yes it works.

1228
01:27:30,604 --> 01:27:32,836
I learned how to fly on this baby.

1229
01:27:33,127 --> 01:27:36,561
Me and my friend Harling, we...
we flew to Jamaica.

1230
01:27:36,755 --> 01:27:37,984
– Jamaica, in this?

1231
01:27:37,985 --> 01:27:39,430
– Jamaica, in this?
– Yeah, in this.

1232
01:27:39,703 --> 01:27:42,199
We went on a overnight fishing trip about

1233
01:27:42,402 --> 01:27:44,785
two hours south to here,
and next thing you know,

1234
01:27:45,130 --> 01:27:46,668
Bethel, Jamaica.

1235
01:27:47,674 --> 01:27:49,696
– You're insane.
– Yes, I am.

1236
01:27:49,973 --> 01:27:52,713
It was beautiful, just like a... postcard,

1237
01:27:52,721 --> 01:27:55,983
you know, one of those
gipsy postcards with...

1238
01:27:55,999 --> 01:27:59,688
white sand, beautiful... sky, blue seas.

1239
01:28:01,014 --> 01:28:02,910
It's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.

1240
01:28:04,752 --> 01:28:07,443
Was the water warm?

1241
01:28:07,624 --> 01:28:08,871
Yes, that was very warm.

1242
01:28:08,973 --> 01:28:10,093
That’s my kind of place.

1243
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:13,027
Let's go.

1244
01:28:13,972 --> 01:28:15,289
Sure, why not.

1245
01:28:16,657 --> 01:28:18,115
Yeah, let's go tomorrow.

1246
01:28:18,737 --> 01:28:19,729
Oh, you're serious?

1247
01:28:19,761 --> 01:28:22,945
I'm very serious. We go in the morning.
You know, let's just get out of here.

1248
01:28:23,359 --> 01:28:24,724
To start over.
– Wait, we can't-

1249
01:28:24,755 --> 01:28:27,767
Yes we can, it will be beautiful,

1250
01:28:27,948 --> 01:28:29,633
these light bright sand beaches,
it's just-

1251
01:28:29,657 --> 01:28:31,295
– I'm worried about you.
– It's paradise.

1252
01:28:31,307 --> 01:28:33,280
Don't worry about me, I'm fine, thank you.

1253
01:28:33,310 --> 01:28:35,651
– Whip, you're not, you're really not.
– Yes I am...

1254
01:28:35,652 --> 01:28:36,786
Yes I am.
– You need help.

1255
01:28:38,239 --> 01:28:39,977
You need rehab, Whip.

1256
01:28:42,164 --> 01:28:45,957
Is it, I need a rehab? So you go
to two AA meetings and I need...?

1257
01:28:46,473 --> 01:28:47,387
Okay.

1258
01:28:47,438 --> 01:28:50,888
Hey look, I won't-Jesus Christ,
don't worry about me, okay?

1259
01:28:50,915 --> 01:28:53,804
You just worry about yourself,
don't worry about me.

1260
01:28:54,075 --> 01:28:56,064
– We're the same, you and me.
– No, we are not the same,

1261
01:28:56,072 --> 01:28:57,439
– Yeah we are.
– we are not the same,

1262
01:28:57,447 --> 01:28:59,110
I don't suck dick to get high, okay?

1263
01:28:59,174 --> 01:29:01,453
Don't give me that "your mother died..."
– I never...

1264
01:29:01,461 --> 01:29:03,045
– and your father...
– I never in my life...

1265
01:29:03,053 --> 01:29:05,091
Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.

1266
01:29:05,093 --> 01:29:06,056
Is that why you shot dope?

1267
01:29:06,057 --> 01:29:06,871
Is that why you shot dope?
– That's not fair.

1268
01:29:06,878 --> 01:29:08,292
That's why you get high?

1269
01:29:08,379 --> 01:29:10,439
There’s a whole lot of people
out there whose mother died,

1270
01:29:10,447 --> 01:29:11,399
they don't fucking drink.

1271
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:11,970
they don't fucking drink.
– You're sick, Whip.

1272
01:29:11,979 --> 01:29:14,657
Yeah, well I die and brace it, shit!

1273
01:29:15,775 --> 01:29:17,458
– I choose to drink.
– You do?

1274
01:29:17,490 --> 01:29:18,875
– Yes I do.
– You choose it, well

1275
01:29:18,876 --> 01:29:20,534
I don't see a whole lot
of choice going on here.

1276
01:29:20,536 --> 01:29:24,214
I choose to drink, and I blame myself.
I'm happy to.

1277
01:29:24,930 --> 01:29:28,047
And you know why?
Because I choose to drink!

1278
01:29:28,726 --> 01:29:32,066
I got an... ex-wife and
a son I never talk to.

1279
01:29:32,906 --> 01:29:36,231
And you know why?
Because I choose to drink!

1280
01:29:38,107 --> 01:29:39,226
Nicole.

1281
01:29:56,589 --> 01:29:58,328
Hey. Listen.

1282
01:30:02,747 --> 01:30:04,081
Alright, look...

1283
01:30:06,688 --> 01:30:10,451
I was loaded when... the plane crashed.

1284
01:30:11,476 --> 01:30:13,692
With this investigation, I don't
know what's gonna happen,

1285
01:30:13,708 --> 01:30:15,755
I could go to jail
for the rest of my life.

1286
01:30:17,348 --> 01:30:19,307
I gotta get out of here.

1287
01:30:21,516 --> 01:30:23,583
And I want you to come with me.

1288
01:30:25,184 --> 01:30:26,304
Whip.

1289
01:30:31,352 --> 01:30:34,077
I'm afraid that I'm going
to use again, d'you understand?

1290
01:30:34,117 --> 01:30:35,624
Then come with me.

1291
01:30:36,325 --> 01:30:38,853
Just come with me.
I need help. I do.

1292
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:41,462
I'd like it if you got help.

1293
01:30:41,487 --> 01:30:44,976
I'll get help, we go straight to Jamaica,
we go right to the local hospital.

1294
01:30:45,007 --> 01:30:46,407
I'll do it.

1295
01:30:46,724 --> 01:30:49,229
For you, I'll do anyting.
Anything you want.

1296
01:30:53,157 --> 01:30:54,748
I don't want to use again.

1297
01:30:56,261 --> 01:30:59,467
I can't. I won’t
make it back, Whip.

1298
01:31:01,309 --> 01:31:02,838
I won't force you to stay.

1299
01:31:03,113 --> 01:31:05,626
If you don't like it,
if I'm not sober, whatever,

1300
01:31:05,731 --> 01:31:08,781
then you leave,
I promise you you can leave.

1301
01:31:12,753 --> 01:31:16,710
We can leave before noon.
I’m a great pilot.

1302
01:31:16,968 --> 01:31:19,971
So many beautiful things to see, I just...

1303
01:31:21,489 --> 01:31:24,625
I just want you to come with me.

1304
01:32:24,505 --> 01:32:25,718
– Everything okay, sweetie?

1305
01:32:25,743 --> 01:32:27,243
– Everything okay, sweetie?
Yeah. Okay.

1306
01:32:35,843 --> 01:32:36,963
Nicole.

1307
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:39,600
Nicole?

1308
01:33:09,552 --> 01:33:11,885
<i>You’ve reached the Whitaker
Crop Dusting Company.</i>

1309
01:33:11,901 --> 01:33:14,453
<i>Please leave a message
and it will be returned.</i>

1310
01:33:15,689 --> 01:33:17,290
<i>Hey Whip, if you're there, pick up.</i>

1311
01:33:17,291 --> 01:33:19,119
<i>It's Charlie, I got some good news.</i>

1312
01:33:40,170 --> 01:33:41,290
Hello?

1313
01:33:52,335 --> 01:33:54,558
Aah, there's our man!

1314
01:33:54,721 --> 01:33:55,691
Hey!

1315
01:33:57,355 --> 01:33:59,174
Captain Whitaker.

1316
01:33:59,662 --> 01:34:02,128
Let me be the first
to say congratulations.

1317
01:34:02,198 --> 01:34:03,969
It's a good day. We've won.

1318
01:34:04,433 --> 01:34:06,701
Yeah, this is what we call
in my profession a "walk-over".

1319
01:34:07,205 --> 01:34:09,241
Yeah, they sheduled the
hearing, it's ten days away,

1320
01:34:09,271 --> 01:34:11,120
they can be tough, but
you just got to be sharp,

1321
01:34:11,132 --> 01:34:13,408
stay focused, answer
the questions correctly.

1322
01:34:13,424 --> 01:34:14,984
That's right, then we're good.

1323
01:34:14,998 --> 01:34:17,231
Right, I successfully
had an “Act of God”

1324
01:34:17,232 --> 01:34:19,623
added to the NTSB's list
of probable causes,

1325
01:34:19,647 --> 01:34:21,394
we've shifted suspicion away from you.

1326
01:34:21,404 --> 01:34:24,919
It's no longer a question of your
condition, but the condition of the plane.

1327
01:34:25,523 --> 01:34:27,848
That's what I've been
trying to tell everybody.

1328
01:34:28,447 --> 01:34:29,613
Broken plane.

1329
01:34:29,801 --> 01:34:31,324
That's right.

1330
01:34:31,574 --> 01:34:34,468
About the... the toxocologiy report?

1331
01:34:34,469 --> 01:34:36,296
Oh, I killed that.

1332
01:34:37,264 --> 01:34:40,250
There is no physical proof that
you were intoxicated on that plane,

1333
01:34:40,258 --> 01:34:41,568
and no eyewitnesses.

1334
01:34:41,639 --> 01:34:44,451
Why we're here?
We're good!?

1335
01:34:44,997 --> 01:34:48,037
Uh... Because there is a...
a small problem.

1336
01:34:48,061 --> 01:34:50,776
Because of the turbulence,
there was no drink service on the flight.

1337
01:34:51,388 --> 01:34:55,437
But they did find two empty
vodka bottles in the galley trash.

1338
01:34:55,766 --> 01:34:57,166
Yeah... uhm...

1339
01:34:57,603 --> 01:34:59,953
And there's no physical
evidence on the bottles,

1340
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:02,789
no DNA, no fingerprints to link
them to anyone, but

1341
01:35:02,802 --> 01:35:04,470
they were uncapped and empty.

1342
01:35:04,681 --> 01:35:07,764
And the only people who would
have had access to those bottles

1343
01:35:07,989 --> 01:35:09,463
would be the flight crew.

1344
01:35:09,706 --> 01:35:13,390
Now Margaret Evans and Camelia Satou,

1345
01:35:13,696 --> 01:35:17,637
they all had clean tox reports.
So that only leaves you,

1346
01:35:17,747 --> 01:35:19,059
– and, uh...
– Trina Marquez.

1347
01:35:19,092 --> 01:35:21,049
Right, Trina Marquez.

1348
01:35:23,004 --> 01:35:24,123
Okay.

1349
01:35:25,630 --> 01:35:28,268
Okay, I see where we're going here.

1350
01:35:29,148 --> 01:35:32,176
That's funny tough, you know,
they only found two bottles.

1351
01:35:32,344 --> 01:35:33,090
– Why's that?

1352
01:35:33,091 --> 01:35:34,377
– Why's that?
– I drank three.

1353
01:35:35,968 --> 01:35:37,784
One's missing.

1354
01:35:39,678 --> 01:35:42,082
You know, when I first met you,

1355
01:35:42,223 --> 01:35:45,627
I couldn't believe what a drunk
arrogant scumbag you were.

1356
01:35:45,637 --> 01:35:46,525
– Oh really?
– Yeah.

1357
01:35:46,541 --> 01:35:47,327
Oh, thank you, you-

1358
01:35:47,335 --> 01:35:49,407
But I did the research, Captain Whitaker.

1359
01:35:49,421 --> 01:35:51,292
I heard the expert analyzes

1360
01:35:51,308 --> 01:35:53,363
and I got to tell you,
I’m in awe of what you did.

1361
01:35:54,285 --> 01:35:58,711
The FAA and the NTSB took ten pilots,
placed them in simulators,

1362
01:35:58,718 --> 01:36:02,098
recreated the events that led to
this plane falling out of the sky.

1363
01:36:02,384 --> 01:36:05,326
Do you know how many of them
were able to safely land the planes?

1364
01:36:05,741 --> 01:36:06,647
Not one.

1365
01:36:07,053 --> 01:36:09,131
Every pilot crashed the aircraft.

1366
01:36:09,345 --> 01:36:10,756
Killed everybody on board.

1367
01:36:10,841 --> 01:36:12,378
You're the only one who could do it.

1368
01:36:12,717 --> 01:36:13,503
Great.

1369
01:36:15,092 --> 01:36:16,038
I'm going home.

1370
01:36:16,039 --> 01:36:16,776
I'm going home.
– Hey.

1371
01:36:16,877 --> 01:36:18,577
Captain Whitaker, I'm telling you right now,
– Whip, Whip, you can't...

1372
01:36:18,579 --> 01:36:20,351
– you walk away, you're going to prison.
– Listen man.

1373
01:36:20,419 --> 01:36:21,948
I'm trying to save your fucking life.

1374
01:36:21,963 --> 01:36:23,275
What fucking life?

1375
01:36:23,823 --> 01:36:26,305
Uh? Don’t kill yourself
on my account, Hugh!

1376
01:36:26,412 --> 01:36:30,322
Captain Whitaker, this NTSB hearing
is a federal agency hearing.

1377
01:36:30,338 --> 01:36:30,848
Do you understand that?

1378
01:36:30,849 --> 01:36:31,994
Do you understand that?
– Yes, I understand that.

1379
01:36:32,015 --> 01:36:34,692
Okay, well we can't play
around with these people.

1380
01:36:35,011 --> 01:36:37,671
Now we walk in there
like this, with this...

1381
01:36:37,992 --> 01:36:39,271
we're done.

1382
01:36:39,345 --> 01:36:41,702
Everything we've done
goes right out the window.

1383
01:36:42,592 --> 01:36:46,433
I have no more moves, alright?
It's all on you right now.

1384
01:36:50,045 --> 01:36:52,794
Ok, Charlie, just get him
to the church on time.

1385
01:36:53,044 --> 01:36:55,119
Get him to the church on time.

1386
01:36:55,122 --> 01:36:59,909
Yeah Charlie, just keep him nice and
sober, so he can save your fucking union.

1387
01:37:00,048 --> 01:37:04,294
Uh? And that fucking airline.
Fuck you Charlie, fuck you.

1388
01:38:06,704 --> 01:38:07,961
It's him.

1389
01:38:08,367 --> 01:38:10,187
Yeah. It's him already.

1390
01:38:17,117 --> 01:38:18,517
How you doin'?

1391
01:38:19,348 --> 01:38:20,678
What are you doing here?

1392
01:38:22,118 --> 01:38:24,490
It's good to see you too, Deana.
May I come in?

1393
01:38:26,740 --> 01:38:28,840
I just thought I'd come by and...

1394
01:38:29,404 --> 01:38:31,519
see how you and Will were doing.
Will?

1395
01:38:31,668 --> 01:38:32,894
Knuckles?

1396
01:38:33,818 --> 01:38:36,222
I'd like-you know, we
haven’t talked in a while,

1397
01:38:36,225 --> 01:38:39,795
so with the thing that happened I just
thought I'd come by and we'd... talk.

1398
01:38:40,855 --> 01:38:43,133
You know that I prefer
that you call us.

1399
01:38:43,234 --> 01:38:45,677
Right, right, to call you, but I mean...

1400
01:38:47,047 --> 01:38:49,958
Not like anybody around here calls me...

1401
01:38:50,047 --> 01:38:52,909
the last three years only
to ask for some money.

1402
01:38:53,981 --> 01:38:55,572
Have you been drinking?

1403
01:38:55,892 --> 01:38:57,392
Well, that didn't take long, did it?

1404
01:38:57,439 --> 01:39:01,236
Right... 17 seconds...
Yeah, exactly 17 seconds.

1405
01:39:01,394 --> 01:39:03,360
– Ladies and gentlemen, it took exactly
– Fucking hell, could you just leave!

1406
01:39:03,361 --> 01:39:07,211
17 seconds before my ex-wife Deana
Coleman asked me if I was drinking,

1407
01:39:07,212 --> 01:39:08,412
what the hell.
– Just leave!

1408
01:39:08,413 --> 01:39:10,925
A world record. Leave the house
that I pay for.

1409
01:39:10,938 --> 01:39:12,838
Is that you want me to do?
– Oh. I'll call the police.

1410
01:39:12,862 --> 01:39:13,799
Call the police.

1411
01:39:14,202 --> 01:39:15,207
– I'm telling you-
– Will!

1412
01:39:15,223 --> 01:39:17,152
Whitaker Jr! How're you doing, son?

1413
01:39:17,395 --> 01:39:20,260
Man of the house.
Thanks for calling me back.

1414
01:39:20,261 --> 01:39:22,508
I'm telling you to leave.

1415
01:39:23,564 --> 01:39:24,964
Are you?

1416
01:39:25,438 --> 01:39:26,802
You're the man of the house now.

1417
01:39:26,832 --> 01:39:28,976
You upset my mother.
You gotta go.

1418
01:39:29,066 --> 01:39:30,768
Oh, you- Well, I’m your father, tough guy.

1419
01:39:31,162 --> 01:39:32,012
You're a drunk.

1420
01:39:33,673 --> 01:39:36,234
I'm a drunk?
You don't know who the fuck I am.

1421
01:39:36,249 --> 01:39:38,577
I sure don't!
Won't you tell me!

1422
01:39:38,578 --> 01:39:40,833
Who the fuck are you, uh?
Who are you?

1423
01:39:41,700 --> 01:39:43,416
Get the fuck out.

1424
01:39:46,106 --> 01:39:47,252
Stop it! Stop it!

1425
01:39:47,431 --> 01:39:48,666
Stop it! Stop it!

1426
01:39:48,681 --> 01:39:50,283
– I love you son.
– Get the fuck out!

1427
01:39:50,658 --> 01:39:53,521
– Get the fuck out!
– Get out now!

1428
01:39:54,494 --> 01:39:56,405
I know where I'm not wanted.

1429
01:39:57,490 --> 01:40:00,481
Captain Whitaker, a lot of people are
working to keep you out of the media,

1430
01:40:00,497 --> 01:40:01,597
are you hiding something?

1431
01:40:01,613 --> 01:40:03,676
Leave my family some room, please.

1432
01:40:03,692 --> 01:40:08,579
This is not the appropriate time,
at the appropriate time, I will, uh...

1433
01:40:08,892 --> 01:40:10,960
tell my story, and uh...

1434
01:40:10,990 --> 01:40:13,091
now is the time for grieving.

1435
01:40:13,854 --> 01:40:15,674
<i>And uh...</i>

1436
01:40:15,922 --> 01:40:17,794
<i>taking care of the injured. Thank you.</i>

1437
01:40:18,613 --> 01:40:21,413
<i>.. questions remain about the flight,
but they won't be answered today,</i>

1438
01:40:21,426 --> 01:40:25,454
<i>as Captain Whitaker politely asked
that we give his familly some peace.</i>

1439
01:40:25,495 --> 01:40:29,641
<i>A reasonable request from a quiet
heroic man, who’s been through-</i>

1440
01:40:29,656 --> 01:40:31,030
Hey Charlie.

1441
01:40:34,486 --> 01:40:36,853
Look, it's just that I just
couldn't find a safe place, uh,

1442
01:40:36,863 --> 01:40:38,814
Amanda was kind enough
to let me in, and-

1443
01:40:38,830 --> 01:40:39,852
– Yeah, I know.
– Thank you.

1444
01:40:39,856 --> 01:40:41,299
Are you sure I can't get you something...

1445
01:40:41,314 --> 01:40:42,950
No. We're trough.

1446
01:40:42,998 --> 01:40:45,403
But thank you.
Thank you very much.

1447
01:40:47,331 --> 01:40:48,938
Now what the hell is wrong with you?

1448
01:40:49,649 --> 01:40:50,679
Really...

1449
01:40:51,331 --> 01:40:54,508
Hugh just called me, apparently
you went to your ex-wife's house,

1450
01:40:54,582 --> 01:40:57,130
drunk as a skunk, the news crew showed up,

1451
01:40:57,146 --> 01:40:58,906
and then the police escort you out!

1452
01:40:58,939 --> 01:41:00,921
It’s okay, though.
I’ve been watching, it’s okay.

1453
01:41:00,939 --> 01:41:03,326
Oh yeah, no, Hugh checked
all the media outlet that covered,

1454
01:41:03,358 --> 01:41:05,480
you come off- you come off fine,
so I guess we're good.

1455
01:41:05,482 --> 01:41:07,564
Good, ok, good, ok,
here's the deal. I-

1456
01:41:07,565 --> 01:41:09,939
No Whip, Whip, there's no deal.
Sorry, look at you.

1457
01:41:09,940 --> 01:41:13,791
I got no idea what you’re gonna do
or say, ever. You’re all over the place.

1458
01:41:13,807 --> 01:41:16,266
I was the one guy in your court.
The one guy.

1459
01:41:16,469 --> 01:41:19,302
I was your defender and
your apologist, but no more!

1460
01:41:19,517 --> 01:41:20,779
Charlie, I can do this.

1461
01:41:20,906 --> 01:41:23,684
You're about to be questioned
by a Federal agency about

1462
01:41:23,702 --> 01:41:28,004
piloting an airliner drunk, an airliner
that crashed, and you continue to drink!

1463
01:41:28,100 --> 01:41:30,559
And stumble around. What kind
of crazy ya have to be to do that?

1464
01:41:30,622 --> 01:41:32,940
I'm afraid of you.
– Ok alright, let me stay with you.

1465
01:41:33,185 --> 01:41:35,292
Let me stay with you, they're
staking out all my houses anyway,

1466
01:41:35,299 --> 01:41:37,092
I'll stay with you, until... until...

1467
01:41:37,181 --> 01:41:40,288
you know un- un-
until the hearing.

1468
01:41:40,629 --> 01:41:42,555
I won't leave the house.

1469
01:41:45,368 --> 01:41:47,658
I won't.

1470
01:41:49,012 --> 01:41:50,201
– You cannot drink in my house.

1471
01:41:50,202 --> 01:41:51,362
– You cannot drink in my house.
– I won't, I won't, I won't.

1472
01:41:51,373 --> 01:41:52,956
You can't have a drink.

1473
01:41:54,206 --> 01:41:55,605
I won't.

1474
01:42:02,082 --> 01:42:03,963
– Officer Edmonds.
– Yes sir.

1475
01:42:04,581 --> 01:42:06,633
Whip, this is officer Edmonds,
he'll be staying here tonight.

1476
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:08,336
Any problems, he’ll handle it.

1477
01:42:12,306 --> 01:42:14,335
Captain Whitaker.
You...

1478
01:42:14,999 --> 01:42:17,091
you look great.
I mean that.

1479
01:42:17,430 --> 01:42:19,279
Thank you. Thank you very much.
I feel good.

1480
01:42:19,722 --> 01:42:21,914
Charlie tells me you haven't
had a drink in eight days.

1481
01:42:22,103 --> 01:42:25,461
Nine days. Two hours, 26 minutes,
but who's counting?

1482
01:42:25,587 --> 01:42:28,184
Okay. Right here.

1483
01:42:29,668 --> 01:42:32,332
So yeah, we want to make this
as easy as possible...

1484
01:42:32,390 --> 01:42:33,934
on you, I hope this is okay.

1485
01:42:33,966 --> 01:42:36,152
Maybe just relax, and get some rest,

1486
01:42:36,233 --> 01:42:38,190
order up a steak, get a movie.

1487
01:42:38,668 --> 01:42:43,950
I made a copy of the entire...
investigation, my file on you.

1488
01:42:45,042 --> 01:42:48,562
I was trying to anticipate what kinds of
questions they might ask you under oath,

1489
01:42:48,743 --> 01:42:51,717
and I wrote some
non-damaging responses, so...

1490
01:42:51,872 --> 01:42:55,532
It's all in there. You know,
it's photos, and... interviews,

1491
01:42:55,566 --> 01:42:57,236
there's some testimony in there.

1492
01:42:57,837 --> 01:43:00,627
Called Ellen Block, told her
you're here, you're all tucked in.

1493
01:43:01,700 --> 01:43:03,307
She got the knife out for me?

1494
01:43:05,589 --> 01:43:08,874
Well, look. She... she's not happy
that I killed the tox report, but

1495
01:43:08,926 --> 01:43:13,048
this isn't a trial. So she's very limited
in the kinds of questions she can ask you.

1496
01:43:13,116 --> 01:43:14,784
You know. You're gonna be fine.

1497
01:43:14,973 --> 01:43:19,056
Yeah. The hearing's at ten,
so uh... just downstairs, so

1498
01:43:19,066 --> 01:43:21,898
well I think we can meet here at nine
for breakfast in our room,

1499
01:43:22,164 --> 01:43:23,716
and, uh...

1500
01:43:24,136 --> 01:43:25,622
take it from there.

1501
01:43:26,613 --> 01:43:28,696
Alright, captain Whitaker.
See you in the morning.

1502
01:43:28,712 --> 01:43:31,522
Thank you, and thank you...
for letting me stay in your house,

1503
01:43:31,536 --> 01:43:33,246
you have a beautiful home,
beautiful family, and-

1504
01:43:33,247 --> 01:43:34,384
You did great. I'm happy.

1505
01:43:34,403 --> 01:43:35,571
I needed it. I needed it.

1506
01:43:36,048 --> 01:43:38,189
– It's alright.
– I'm happy we did it.

1507
01:43:39,253 --> 01:43:40,013
– Alright,
– Okay.

1508
01:43:40,014 --> 01:43:41,343
– see you in the morning.
– Yes.

1509
01:43:50,527 --> 01:43:52,034
Looks like fine...

1510
01:46:13,028 --> 01:46:14,148
Hello?

1511
01:46:35,788 --> 01:46:36,907
Hello?

1512
01:48:57,787 --> 01:48:58,772
– How's our man?

1513
01:48:58,773 --> 01:49:00,354
– How's our man?
– Not a peep.

1514
01:49:08,370 --> 01:49:10,549
Maybe he overslept.

1515
01:49:11,789 --> 01:49:14,137
Didn't let any girls in there
last night, did you?

1516
01:49:14,309 --> 01:49:15,429
No sir.

1517
01:49:15,828 --> 01:49:19,153
Not a soul, no one came in or
out outside of... room service.

1518
01:49:24,666 --> 01:49:26,086
You have a key?

1519
01:49:26,843 --> 01:49:28,218
Hey Whip.

1520
01:49:28,999 --> 01:49:31,356
Hey buddy?
Whip!

1521
01:49:31,677 --> 01:49:32,796
Shit.

1522
01:49:35,956 --> 01:49:38,937
– Where the fucking fuck is he?
– Oh Jeez.

1523
01:49:39,094 --> 01:49:41,038
Where is he?
Where is he, where is he?

1524
01:49:41,065 --> 01:49:41,791
I don't know.

1525
01:49:41,801 --> 01:49:43,791
Did he fucking walk away?
Son of a bitch!

1526
01:49:43,830 --> 01:49:45,014
Hugh. Hugh.

1527
01:49:45,015 --> 01:49:45,766
Whip!

1528
01:49:47,150 --> 01:49:48,294
Get a med- Yak, damnit!

1529
01:49:48,295 --> 01:49:50,116
– Oh no, is he dead?
– I don't know.

1530
01:49:50,304 --> 01:49:51,616
– Is he dead?
– I don't know!

1531
01:49:51,640 --> 01:49:52,933
Yeah, I'm dead, yeah!

1532
01:49:52,949 --> 01:49:54,683
Do you want me to get an ambulance?

1533
01:49:54,809 --> 01:49:55,689
No, no no.

1534
01:49:55,834 --> 01:49:56,721
No, no no.

1535
01:49:56,723 --> 01:49:57,931
Look, uh...

1536
01:49:57,948 --> 01:49:59,879
Let's just get the bed.

1537
01:50:00,030 --> 01:50:02,309
– Come on. Come on.
– It's alright, that's alright.

1538
01:50:02,977 --> 01:50:05,583
That's it, Charlie.
Ok, that's it, we're fucked, man.

1539
01:50:05,614 --> 01:50:08,041
He's just fucked,
your guy is just fucked, Charlie!

1540
01:50:08,159 --> 01:50:10,689
Alright. You just get on the front door,
make sure nobody comes in.

1541
01:50:10,698 --> 01:50:11,765
Put that on your head, you...

1542
01:50:11,780 --> 01:50:12,900
can't go, man.
– Get there, hey!

1543
01:50:12,966 --> 01:50:13,965
What time is it?

1544
01:50:13,966 --> 01:50:15,522
– We got 45 minutes, okay?

1545
01:50:15,537 --> 01:50:17,073
Well, how much grace you think we got?

1546
01:50:17,129 --> 01:50:20,399
Grace? Ellen Block?
We're gonna get some fucking grace?

1547
01:50:20,579 --> 01:50:23,404
Well, we probably got an hour before
we really gotta get him downstairs.

1548
01:50:23,420 --> 01:50:26,195
Okay great, but let's just get a wheelchair,
and wheel his ass into the hearing.

1549
01:50:26,196 --> 01:50:27,346
Call Harling Mays, man.

1550
01:50:27,362 --> 01:50:28,541
Call Harling, he's got a wheelchair?

1551
01:50:28,565 --> 01:50:30,901
He got cocaine, is it...

1552
01:50:31,166 --> 01:50:32,419
Cocaine?

1553
01:50:37,601 --> 01:50:38,507
Hey bro.

1554
01:50:39,352 --> 01:50:42,131
Harling Mays. I'm on the list.

1555
01:50:42,303 --> 01:50:43,423
Well.

1556
01:50:44,949 --> 01:50:46,705
What's the deal, buddy?

1557
01:50:46,831 --> 01:50:49,235
You look like you're hurt, for certain.

1558
01:50:49,237 --> 01:50:51,836
– Thanks for com-
– Do not touch the merch, motherfucker!

1559
01:50:56,004 --> 01:50:57,840
Take one step back, please.

1560
01:51:00,059 --> 01:51:03,759
C-Lo, I need you outside guarding
the door please, thank you very much.

1561
01:51:06,119 --> 01:51:07,624
It's alright. Yeah.

1562
01:51:08,185 --> 01:51:09,278
Alright gentlemen.

1563
01:51:09,286 --> 01:51:12,856
I need that table cleared, placed in
front of Whip, with the chair behind it.

1564
01:51:13,524 --> 01:51:14,974
Now please!

1565
01:51:17,460 --> 01:51:22,559
I need a glass of water, I need a credit
card, I need a hundred dollar bill.

1566
01:51:22,853 --> 01:51:24,093
– I got a 20.

1567
01:51:24,094 --> 01:51:25,374
– I got a 20.
– She'll do.

1568
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:28,982
Whip, been unable to come!?

1569
01:51:29,053 --> 01:51:30,979
And I need a coco puff.

1570
01:51:31,690 --> 01:51:32,734
A what?

1571
01:51:33,734 --> 01:51:38,059
Just take the tinyest little bit of tobacco
out of the top of a cigarette, please.

1572
01:51:38,286 --> 01:51:40,527
Damn. Amateur, man.

1573
01:51:41,742 --> 01:51:44,152
We're almost home, okay baby.

1574
01:51:44,745 --> 01:51:46,438
We're gonna do....

1575
01:51:47,235 --> 01:51:49,055
two small whiffs first...

1576
01:51:51,287 --> 01:51:53,652
One on each side.

1577
01:51:53,804 --> 01:51:56,963
Just a little primer, to get it started.

1578
01:51:58,781 --> 01:52:00,740
"Coco Puff".

1579
01:52:11,847 --> 01:52:13,480
Good boy, atta boy, head back.

1580
01:52:13,621 --> 01:52:16,149
Swallow. Water.
Water, now! Chief, you.

1581
01:52:29,794 --> 01:52:31,955
Little coco puff, buddy.

1582
01:52:33,250 --> 01:52:34,841
Who's the banana man?

1583
01:52:35,036 --> 01:52:37,231
– You.
– Who's the banana man, alright.

1584
01:52:37,443 --> 01:52:39,190
Now focus up, big dog.

1585
01:52:45,119 --> 01:52:46,335
– There's a train coming to you.

1586
01:52:46,336 --> 01:52:48,335
– There's a train coming to you.
– Yeah.

1587
01:52:48,641 --> 01:52:50,357
Keep it down, big dog.

1588
01:52:51,633 --> 01:52:53,740
Banana boat's coming.
Where's banana boat?

1589
01:52:53,826 --> 01:52:55,134
– Banana boat is here.

1590
01:52:55,135 --> 01:52:56,549
– Banana boat is here.
– Alright.

1591
01:53:00,261 --> 01:53:02,156
Nothing keeps you down dog.

1592
01:53:03,045 --> 01:53:05,218
Nothing keeps that big dog down.

1593
01:53:08,389 --> 01:53:09,754
Guy, you're up.

1594
01:53:11,703 --> 01:53:12,413
– Oh, uh-

1595
01:53:12,414 --> 01:53:13,675
– Oh, uh-
– I don't, uhm...

1596
01:53:14,432 --> 01:53:15,544
That won't do any help, thank you.

1597
01:53:15,545 --> 01:53:17,578
That won't do any help, thank you.
– Shit, I'm taking that with you.

1598
01:53:26,381 --> 01:53:27,645
Thank you, brother.

1599
01:53:28,098 --> 01:53:30,017
– Shit, I'm back.
– Aha baby.

1600
01:53:30,466 --> 01:53:31,986
– I love you.
– I love you.

1601
01:53:39,288 --> 01:53:42,917
Alright. Which of one you gentlemen
is flowing in this enterprise?

1602
01:53:43,577 --> 01:53:44,645
Alright.

1603
01:53:44,685 --> 01:53:47,776
It's 500 bucks, I got...
you know, I got like 80 bucks on me.

1604
01:53:48,660 --> 01:53:49,837
I just need...

1605
01:53:49,932 --> 01:53:52,032
How much you got?
– I got it, I got it.

1606
01:53:52,135 --> 01:53:53,694
Alright.
– Here.

1607
01:53:53,717 --> 01:53:54,819
– Just...
– What the...

1608
01:53:54,843 --> 01:53:56,813
– You pay him.
– Pay him?

1609
01:53:56,836 --> 01:53:59,052
Thank you.
Okay.

1610
01:53:59,889 --> 01:54:01,628
There's a gram in here.

1611
01:54:01,851 --> 01:54:05,403
You take it, you've paid for it,
he's gonna need it later.

1612
01:54:06,830 --> 01:54:08,929
My work here is finished.

1613
01:54:11,884 --> 01:54:14,343
See you all on the dark side of the moon.

1614
01:54:14,474 --> 01:54:16,432
<i>♪Feeling alright...</i>

1615
01:54:18,790 --> 01:54:21,117
<i>♪I'm not feeling that good myself...</i>

1616
01:54:24,945 --> 01:54:26,723
<i>♪Feeling alright...</i>

1617
01:54:29,793 --> 01:54:32,173
<i>♪I'm not feeling that good myself...</i>

1618
01:55:04,976 --> 01:55:06,536
I'll go ahead and tell ‘em we're here.

1619
01:55:06,817 --> 01:55:07,716
You’re gonna make it.

1620
01:55:07,864 --> 01:55:09,676
Remember, if they ask about your drinking,

1621
01:55:09,684 --> 01:55:11,934
it’s totally acceptable
to say, “I don’t recall.”

1622
01:55:11,953 --> 01:55:15,044
Hey, don't tell me how
to lie about my drinking, okay?

1623
01:55:15,603 --> 01:55:19,250
I’m gonna lie about my drinking, I've been
lying about my drinking my whole life.

1624
01:55:36,721 --> 01:55:38,561
Those are difficult images to watch.

1625
01:55:38,644 --> 01:55:41,788
For the record, I'm Ellen Block,
Hearing Officer for this hearing.

1626
01:55:41,928 --> 01:55:43,582
Captain Whitaker, good morning.

1627
01:55:43,738 --> 01:55:45,479
Morning.
Morning.

1628
01:55:45,695 --> 01:55:50,315
What that video captures is that the
aircraft was in a relatively stable glide

1629
01:55:50,330 --> 01:55:52,329
just prior to the moment of impact.

1630
01:55:52,671 --> 01:55:57,000
However, according to the data we
retreived from the cockpit data recorders,

1631
01:55:57,153 --> 01:56:01,696
at exactly 9:34, after flying
27 minutes without incident,

1632
01:56:01,802 --> 01:56:07,986
the transponder recorded a loss in
altitude in excess of 4800 feet per minute

1633
01:56:08,049 --> 01:56:11,756
in what is considered a
“full pitch nose down” attitude.

1634
01:56:12,002 --> 01:56:16,367
Then, at 9:42, according
to the data recorders,

1635
01:56:16,492 --> 01:56:19,848
a decision was made to
invert the aircraft.

1636
01:56:19,969 --> 01:56:24,439
The NTSB has created animated simulation
that I would like to play at this point.

1637
01:56:25,671 --> 01:56:26,728
<i>– We gonna roll it, okay?</i>

1638
01:56:26,729 --> 01:56:27,895
<i>– We gonna roll it, okay?
– What do you mean, roll it?</i>

1639
01:56:27,918 --> 01:56:29,980
<i>We gotta do something to stop this dive.</i>

1640
01:56:30,023 --> 01:56:31,879
<i>Margaret. What's your son's name?</i>

1641
01:56:31,942 --> 01:56:32,988
<i>Trevor.</i>

1642
01:56:33,013 --> 01:56:33,917
<i>– Say "I love you, Trevor".</i>

1643
01:56:33,918 --> 01:56:34,518
<i>– Say "I love you, Trevor".
– What?</i>

1644
01:56:34,520 --> 01:56:35,509
<i>– Black box. Say "I love you Trevor".</i>

1645
01:56:35,510 --> 01:56:36,417
<i>– Black box. Say "I love you Trevor".
– "I love you Trevor".</i>

1646
01:56:36,470 --> 01:56:38,583
<i>You be a good boy.
Mommy loves you.</i>

1647
01:56:38,607 --> 01:56:41,355
<i>Okay, here we go. I've got control.</i>

1648
01:56:41,386 --> 01:56:44,385
<i>Oh good Lord.
Jesus!</i>

1649
01:56:45,364 --> 01:56:46,689
<i>– Flaps out.
– Flaps out!</i>

1650
01:56:46,870 --> 01:56:48,760
<i>– Speed brakes.
– Speed brakes!</i>

1651
01:56:49,613 --> 01:56:51,493
<i>Margaret.
Power!</i>

1652
01:56:51,765 --> 01:56:53,301
<i>– Gear up.
– Gear up!</i>

1653
01:56:53,442 --> 01:56:55,403
<i>Oh, Lord Jesus, we're inverted!</i>

1654
01:56:55,447 --> 01:56:58,143
<i>Good flying lesson... We’re leve...
...maintain alt... like this.</i>

1655
01:56:58,194 --> 01:57:03,104
<i>Atlan... 2-2-7... we are inverted,
I... we are... verted.</i>

1656
01:57:03,236 --> 01:57:06,499
<i>Southj... 2... 7... did you say inverted?</i>

1657
01:57:07,876 --> 01:57:10,818
That audio is tragic and compelling.

1658
01:57:10,906 --> 01:57:13,022
I chose to play that part
of the cockpit recording

1659
01:57:13,023 --> 01:57:16,776
to highlight a key moment
onboard flight 2-2-7,

1660
01:57:16,777 --> 01:57:21,889
wherein you say “We’re gonna roll it,
here we go, I’ve got control.”

1661
01:57:22,100 --> 01:57:25,769
You made a very conscious
decision to invert the aircraft

1662
01:57:25,776 --> 01:57:28,748
to roll the plane upside down.
Is that correct?

1663
01:57:31,547 --> 01:57:35,652
I'm not sure if it was
conscious, but uh...

1664
01:57:36,256 --> 01:57:38,081
it was more like instinct.

1665
01:57:39,029 --> 01:57:40,863
What led to that decision?

1666
01:57:45,391 --> 01:57:46,759
I don't recall.

1667
01:57:47,250 --> 01:57:49,153
Let me quote from an
investigative summary

1668
01:57:49,169 --> 01:57:53,528
”From 9:34 until 9:42
the events on the aircraft are”,

1669
01:57:53,542 --> 01:57:56,609
again I quote, “bold and remarkable”.

1670
01:57:57,151 --> 01:58:00,942
“By inverting the plane, Captain
Whitaker arrested the descent,

1671
01:58:01,036 --> 01:58:03,431
and allowed the aircraft to level off,

1672
01:58:03,544 --> 01:58:07,728
enabling him to glide the aircraft
away from any populated areas,

1673
01:58:07,782 --> 01:58:11,920
and allowing him to execute
a forced landing in an open field.

1674
01:58:21,526 --> 01:58:23,914
I heard a loud metallic bang.

1675
01:58:24,805 --> 01:58:26,617
We pitched nose down.

1676
01:58:28,499 --> 01:58:29,434
No control.

1677
01:58:29,497 --> 01:58:32,973
Yes. First Officer Evans
testimony confirms the same.

1678
01:58:36,014 --> 01:58:37,332
I want to show you something.

1679
01:58:42,126 --> 01:58:43,967
Nothing's happening, uh...

1680
01:58:44,764 --> 01:58:48,230
Its remote control isn't working,
apologies, I can do this manually.

1681
01:58:59,594 --> 01:59:03,036
This is the jackscrew on the
tail assembly that articulates

1682
01:59:03,048 --> 01:59:06,880
the horizontal stabilizer...
also known as the elevator.

1683
01:59:07,252 --> 01:59:11,688
As you can see, the threads on
this screw are almost entirely gone.

1684
01:59:12,261 --> 01:59:18,125
This part was suggested as a maintenance
replacement in January of 2011.

1685
01:59:18,193 --> 01:59:19,752
It was never replaced.

1686
01:59:19,979 --> 01:59:24,054
It had an additional 1200 hours
of flight on it. It finally failed.

1687
01:59:24,427 --> 01:59:29,260
Our investigators have concluded
that the jackscrew snapped

1688
01:59:29,347 --> 01:59:33,086
and the elevator was frozen
in a fixed position,

1689
01:59:33,444 --> 01:59:38,332
locking the elevator in a down position
which forced the plane into a dive.

1690
01:59:38,599 --> 01:59:42,470
The loss of the elevator was,
and I quote our report,

1691
01:59:42,510 --> 01:59:46,186
“a catastrophic event, from
which recovery was improbable

1692
01:59:46,202 --> 01:59:48,639
and stable flight, impossible.”

1693
01:59:52,294 --> 01:59:53,414
Mr. Whitaker...

1694
01:59:54,386 --> 01:59:59,062
I want to talk about the days leading
and the hours leading up to the accident.

1695
01:59:59,253 --> 02:00:02,180
But before I do, I want to
remind you that you are under oath,

1696
02:00:02,189 --> 02:00:05,687
and that any testimony you'll give here
today will be considered admissable

1697
02:00:05,696 --> 02:00:08,420
in any subsequent hearings
or criminal proceedings.

1698
02:00:08,575 --> 02:00:10,740
Do you understand what that means?

1699
02:00:12,780 --> 02:00:16,293
Captain Whitaker, for the record
I need you to verbalize your answer.

1700
02:00:17,310 --> 02:00:19,736
Uh, I'm sorry.
Yes, I understand.

1701
02:00:20,530 --> 02:00:24,309
On the three days leading up
to the accident: Tuesday, October 11th,

1702
02:00:24,326 --> 02:00:27,854
Wednesday, October 12th
or Thursday, October 13th,

1703
02:00:27,864 --> 02:00:32,113
did you consume any alcohol
or other intoxicating elements?

1704
02:00:33,174 --> 02:00:34,538
No, I did not.

1705
02:00:34,858 --> 02:00:38,714
On the morning of the accident,
Friday, October 14th,

1706
02:00:38,863 --> 02:00:44,122
did you consume any alcohol,
or ingest any chemicals or drugs

1707
02:00:44,123 --> 02:00:47,684
that may have impaired your
ability to perform your job?

1708
02:00:48,317 --> 02:00:49,787
No, I did not.

1709
02:00:50,863 --> 02:00:55,033
Mr. Whitaker, do you now or
have you ever had a problem

1710
02:00:55,035 --> 02:00:59,241
with alcohol dependency,
alcoholism or drug addiction?

1711
02:00:59,408 --> 02:01:00,578
No.

1712
02:01:02,902 --> 02:01:05,414
Okay, Mr. Whitaker, we’re about done.

1713
02:01:12,242 --> 02:01:16,939
Due to the severe turbulence in the
early part of the flight, you asked

1714
02:01:16,940 --> 02:01:20,479
the flight crew to suspend the beverage
service on the plane, is that correct?

1715
02:01:20,728 --> 02:01:24,291
Yes, that's correct, I suspended
the drink service on the plane.

1716
02:01:24,340 --> 02:01:29,087
Are you aware that our investigators
found two single-service vodka bottles

1717
02:01:29,088 --> 02:01:30,535
in the galley trash bin?

1718
02:01:33,049 --> 02:01:34,976
Yeah, I'm aware of that.

1719
02:01:35,623 --> 02:01:38,033
There were five crew members on board

1720
02:01:38,041 --> 02:01:40,674
that who would have had access
to the beverage trolley.

1721
02:01:41,008 --> 02:01:42,979
Less than an hour after the accident,

1722
02:01:42,986 --> 02:01:46,067
blood was taken from each
of these crew members, yourself,

1723
02:01:46,563 --> 02:01:51,169
first officer Evans, flight
attendant Margaret Thomason...

1724
02:01:51,566 --> 02:01:56,961
and posthumously from Camelia
Satou, and Katerina Marquez.

1725
02:01:58,104 --> 02:02:01,322
Toxicology analysis was performed and...

1726
02:02:02,010 --> 02:02:04,106
three of these tests came back negative,

1727
02:02:04,107 --> 02:02:08,174
one was disqualified for
technical reasons, and one...

1728
02:02:08,678 --> 02:02:13,706
tested positive for alcohol.
It registered a .17 blood alcohol level.

1729
02:02:13,707 --> 02:02:15,204
Are you aware of that?

1730
02:02:16,223 --> 02:02:18,113
Yeah. I'm aware of it now.

1731
02:02:24,862 --> 02:02:28,952
Miss Marquez was not only a colleague,
but you knew her outside of work,

1732
02:02:28,960 --> 02:02:31,034
is that correct?

1733
02:02:32,037 --> 02:02:33,717
Outside of work...

1734
02:02:34,639 --> 02:02:35,919
No, not really.

1735
02:02:36,031 --> 02:02:38,697
Did you know Miss Marquez
had a drinking problem?

1736
02:02:39,800 --> 02:02:41,013
No, I did not.

1737
02:02:41,122 --> 02:02:43,446
Did you ever see her drink to excess?

1738
02:02:45,965 --> 02:02:47,431
No, I did not.

1739
02:02:47,481 --> 02:02:50,384
Were you aware that she was
twice treated for alcohol addiction,

1740
02:02:50,388 --> 02:02:54,417
the last time was 16 months ago
and paid for by SouthJet Airlines?

1741
02:02:55,872 --> 02:02:57,272
No, I did not.

1742
02:03:07,638 --> 02:03:14,197
Is it your opinion... that Katerina
Marquez... drank on that flight?

1743
02:03:25,806 --> 02:03:27,600
Could you repeat the question?

1744
02:03:28,354 --> 02:03:32,914
Is it your opinion that Katerina
Marquez drank on that flight?

1745
02:03:45,005 --> 02:03:46,288
I’m sorry. My what?

1746
02:03:46,421 --> 02:03:47,540
Your opinion, Captain.

1747
02:03:47,771 --> 02:03:51,003
Since her toxicology report
is the only toxicology report

1748
02:03:51,015 --> 02:03:55,540
that is admissable in this hearing, and
she in fact tested positive for alcohol,

1749
02:03:55,541 --> 02:03:59,445
is it your opinion that Katerina Marquez

1750
02:03:59,466 --> 02:04:03,169
drank those 2 bottles
of vodka on the plane?

1751
02:04:14,718 --> 02:04:17,934
I’m sorry Mr. Whitaker, I couldn’t
hear you. What did you say?

1752
02:04:20,745 --> 02:04:22,711
I said, "God, help me."

1753
02:04:23,482 --> 02:04:26,330
Yes, well. However, is it your opinion-

1754
02:04:26,341 --> 02:04:27,775
It's my opinion...

1755
02:04:28,034 --> 02:04:29,854
Trina did not...

1756
02:04:30,205 --> 02:04:31,757
drink that Vodka.

1757
02:04:32,426 --> 02:04:33,678
Excuse me, Mr. Whitaker?

1758
02:04:33,694 --> 02:04:35,264
She saved the boy’s life, that's-

1759
02:04:35,265 --> 02:04:36,978
Could you speak louder, Captain Whitaker?

1760
02:04:36,986 --> 02:04:39,526
Trina Marquez did not drink the vodka.

1761
02:04:41,111 --> 02:04:43,218
Because I drank the vodka.

1762
02:04:46,196 --> 02:04:47,373
Objection!

1763
02:04:48,285 --> 02:04:50,201
Please be seated sir. This-

1764
02:04:51,131 --> 02:04:52,250
Sir.

1765
02:04:52,401 --> 02:04:53,278
– I drank the vodka bottles-

1766
02:04:53,279 --> 02:04:54,875
– I drank the vodka bottles-
– Did you hear what I said, I object!

1767
02:04:54,883 --> 02:04:57,406
Please be seated sir,
this is not a court room.

1768
02:04:57,476 --> 02:04:58,925
Well, I object anyway!

1769
02:05:00,411 --> 02:05:02,690
I drank the vodka bottles on the plane.

1770
02:05:04,591 --> 02:05:09,237
Captain Whitaker. On the three nights
before the accident, October 11-

1771
02:05:09,248 --> 02:05:14,338
October 11, October 12 and 13th
and 14th, I was intoxicated.

1772
02:05:14,349 --> 02:05:17,331
I drank all of those days, I drank...

1773
02:05:17,941 --> 02:05:19,340
in excess.

1774
02:05:20,770 --> 02:05:23,642
– On the morning of the accident-
– I was drunk.

1775
02:05:31,702 --> 02:05:33,153
I'm drunk now.

1776
02:05:39,687 --> 02:05:41,412
I'm drunk right now...

1777
02:05:42,046 --> 02:05:43,569
Miss Block...

1778
02:05:50,475 --> 02:05:52,159
because I'm an alcoholic.

1779
02:06:18,040 --> 02:06:19,474
That was it.

1780
02:06:23,110 --> 02:06:24,591
I was finished.

1781
02:06:26,551 --> 02:06:27,986
I was done.

1782
02:06:30,977 --> 02:06:36,716
It was as if I had reached
my life long limit... for lies.

1783
02:06:37,999 --> 02:06:41,005
I could not tell one more lie.

1784
02:06:44,530 --> 02:06:46,254
And maybe I'm a sucker.

1785
02:06:48,341 --> 02:06:50,790
Because if I had told just one more lie,

1786
02:06:51,280 --> 02:06:53,845
I could have walked away
from all that mess...

1787
02:06:54,554 --> 02:06:58,132
kept my wings, kept my
false sense of pride...

1788
02:07:00,776 --> 02:07:05,663
and most importantly, I could have avoided
being locked up in here with all of you,

1789
02:07:06,385 --> 02:07:09,256
nice folks for the last 13 months.

1790
02:07:12,871 --> 02:07:14,376
But I'm here.

1791
02:07:15,366 --> 02:07:17,365
And I'll be here for at least the...

1792
02:07:18,045 --> 02:07:20,597
next four or five years.
And that's fair.

1793
02:07:24,477 --> 02:07:27,381
I betrayed the public trust. I did.

1794
02:07:27,571 --> 02:07:31,754
That’s how the judge explained it to me.
I had betrayed the public trust.

1795
02:07:33,542 --> 02:07:36,680
The FAA, they took away
my pilot's license.

1796
02:07:38,650 --> 02:07:39,937
And that's fair.

1797
02:07:40,910 --> 02:07:44,500
My chances of ever flying
again are slim to none.

1798
02:07:46,539 --> 02:07:48,185
And I accept that.

1799
02:07:51,009 --> 02:07:54,077
I got a lot of time to think
about it, the all of it.

1800
02:07:55,937 --> 02:07:57,953
I'm... doing some writing.

1801
02:07:59,922 --> 02:08:03,954
I wrote letters to each of the
families that had lost loved ones, and...

1802
02:08:07,196 --> 02:08:09,216
some of ‘em were able
to hear my apology...

1803
02:08:11,414 --> 02:08:12,864
some of ‘em never will.

1804
02:08:14,697 --> 02:08:17,226
I also apologized to...

1805
02:08:18,437 --> 02:08:22,965
all the people that tried to help me...
along the way, but I...

1806
02:08:24,644 --> 02:08:27,298
couldn't or wouldn't listen.

1807
02:08:30,605 --> 02:08:32,493
People like my wife...

1808
02:08:36,229 --> 02:08:37,890
My ex-wife...

1809
02:08:42,279 --> 02:08:43,769
My son.

1810
02:08:47,064 --> 02:08:50,171
And again like I said, you know,
some of them will...

1811
02:08:52,584 --> 02:08:55,112
never forgive me, some of them will...

1812
02:08:57,551 --> 02:08:59,431
But at least I'm sober.

1813
02:09:02,048 --> 02:09:05,304
I thank God for that,
I’m grateful for that.

1814
02:09:08,130 --> 02:09:10,034
And this is gonna sound really stupid

1815
02:09:10,035 --> 02:09:12,666
coming from a man who’s
locked up in prison...

1816
02:09:15,077 --> 02:09:17,215
but for the first time in my life...

1817
02:09:18,725 --> 02:09:20,277
I’m free.

1818
02:09:33,814 --> 02:09:36,601
Whitaker.
You got a visitor.

1819
02:10:14,069 --> 02:10:16,400
– You have 40 minutes.
– Okay.

1820
02:10:26,870 --> 02:10:28,669
Look at you, boy.

1821
02:10:29,271 --> 02:10:30,477
How you doing?

1822
02:10:30,800 --> 02:10:32,351
– Good.
– You look good.

1823
02:10:33,657 --> 02:10:35,483
Com'on, sit down.

1824
02:10:37,153 --> 02:10:40,108
This is a surprise.
Did you get that gift I sent you?

1825
02:10:40,118 --> 02:10:40,779
– Yeah.
– Yeah?

1826
02:10:40,795 --> 02:10:42,068
– Yeah, I got it.
– You like it?

1827
02:10:42,069 --> 02:10:43,189
– Yeah.
– Good...

1828
02:10:45,637 --> 02:10:48,753
– How's your mom?
– Fine. She's alright.

1829
02:10:50,519 --> 02:10:54,383
My College counselor wanted
me to come in... interview you.

1830
02:10:55,438 --> 02:10:56,453
Me?

1831
02:10:56,639 --> 02:10:59,948
Yeah. I'm writing essays
for College applications.

1832
02:11:00,011 --> 02:11:01,131
Good.

1833
02:11:01,457 --> 02:11:02,923
I need your help.

1834
02:11:03,236 --> 02:11:04,635
So you got it.

1835
02:11:05,881 --> 02:11:10,723
And then... this essay.
The essay that I have to write...

1836
02:11:12,525 --> 02:11:18,959
it's called... “the most fascinating
person... that I’ve never met.”

1837
02:11:29,729 --> 02:11:31,406
So...

1838
02:11:35,970 --> 02:11:37,436
Who are you?

1839
02:11:46,542 --> 02:11:48,079
That's a good question.

1840
02:11:53,151 --> 02:11:58,420
