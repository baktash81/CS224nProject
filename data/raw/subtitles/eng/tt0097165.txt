00:24:04,803 --> 00:24:06,634
Right? Maybe.

Huddle up!

399
00:24:30,243 --> 00:24:33,519
We don't read and write
poetry because it's cute.

400
00:24:33,603 --> 00:24:38,154
We read and write poetry because
we are members of the human race.

401
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:42,794
And the human race
is filled with passion.

402
00:24:42,883 --> 00:24:45,351
Medicine, law,
business, engineering:

403
00:24:45,443 --> 00:24:48,480
these are noble pursuits
and necessary to sustain life.

404
00:24:48,563 --> 00:24:50,952
But poetry,

405
00:24:51,043 --> 00:24:54,956
beauty, romance, love--

406
00:24:55,043 --> 00:24:57,511
these are what
we stay alive for.

- Sorry if I shocked you, Mr McAllister.
- There's no need to apologise.

424
00:26:08,363 --> 00:26:11,321
It was very fascinating,
misguided though it was.

425
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,234
You think so?

426
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:16,440
You take a big risk by encouraging them
to become artists,John.

427
00:26:16,523 --> 00:26:20,118
When they realize that they're
not Rembrandts, Shakespeares or Mozarts,

428
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:21,716
they'll hate you for it.

429
00:26:21,803 --> 00:26:25,079
We're not talking artists, George.
We're talking freethinkers.

430

Freethinkers at 1 7?

00:26:27,563 --> 00:26:29,394
Funny, I never pegged you

432
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:34,317
Not a cynic.

- Gentlemen, can you keep a secret?
- Sure.

466
00:28:16,523 --> 00:28:21,881
The Dead Poets were dedicated
to sucking the marrow out of life.

467
00:28:21,963 --> 00:28:25,080
That's a phrase from Thoreau we'd invoke
at the beginning of every meeting.

468
00:28:25,163 --> 00:28:27,631
You see, we would gather
at the old Indian cave...

469
00:28:27,723 --> 00:28:32,080
and take turns reading from Thoreau,
Whitman, Shelley-- the biggies.

<i>Even some of our own verse.</i>

471
00:28:33,963 --> 00:28:37,433
And in the enchantment of the moment,
we'd let poetry work its magic.

472
00:28:37,523 --> 00:28:40,595
You mean it was a bunch of guys
sitting around, reading poetry?

00:28:40,683 --> 00:28:43,481
No, Mr Overstreet.
It wasn't just <i>guys.</i>

474
00:28:43,563 --> 00:28:46,680
We weren't a Greek organization.
We were romantics.

475
00:28:46,763 --> 00:28:51,598
We didn't just read poetry, we let it
drip from our tongues, like honey.

1767
01:57:24,424 --> 01:57:26,255
''Then ask two questions.
One:

''How artfully has the objective
