 I'M NOT SURE WHY.              

643

646
00:49:10,196 --> 00:49:13,382

TO CONTROL IT.                  

647
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:15,700
NOW, HERE.                      

648
00:49:15,768 --> 00:49:18,971
I WANT YOU TO WRITE DOWN        
EVERY PLACE YOU'VE EVER LIVED,

UNTIL NOW.

STRAIGHT THROUGH THE ALPHABET.

LIKE-LIKE THAT.                 

653

    EASY TO OPERATE.            

654
00:49:36,956 --> 00:49:40,258
    JUST PUSH THE SWITCH        
    AND TALK INTO IT.           

655
00:49:41,494 --> 00:49:45,430

BUT... WHAT'S THIS FOR ?        

656
00:49:45,865 --> 00:49:49,318
    - JUST A LIFELONG HOBBY.    
    - DON'T TOUCH IT.           

657

    ENOUGH SAMPLES,             

658
00:49:51,404 --> 00:49:55,374

A COMPUTER AND PROGRAM IT.      

659

AN INSTANT GEOGRAPHICAL RUNDOWN 
ON A PERSON.                    

660
00:50:00,012 --> 00:50:03,214

MORE IMPORTANT THAN FINGERPRINTS

IN ONE OF OUR PROJECTS,

THE LAW THAN HE DOES ABOUT ME,
