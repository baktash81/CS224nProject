2
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,783
Ayah, we're leaving now.
Ayah!

3
00:01:51,617 --> 00:01:54,854
- Bring the car round! Please!
- Yes, sir.

4
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:02,328
- Jemima?
- Ayah. Get the suitcase!

5
00:02:02,362 --> 00:02:04,965
Can you sleep?

6
00:02:04,998 --> 00:02:08,201
Now!

7
00:02:08,233 --> 00:02:10,604
Are you scared?

8
00:02:11,904 --> 00:02:13,273
Don't be.

9
00:02:15,808 --> 00:02:17,744
Shall I tell you a story?

10
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,351
There were once two people
called Rama...

11
00:02:26,351 --> 00:02:27,987
and Sita.

12
00:02:29,821 --> 00:02:31,857
And they loved each other.

13
00:02:35,028 --> 00:02:37,798
They spent their days
dancing and singing together.

14
00:02:39,832 --> 00:02:41,301
Grrr!

15
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:44,870
And then Sita was kidnapped
by the evil demon Ravana.

16
00:02:44,904 --> 00:02:47,708
Grrr!

17
00:03:13,231 --> 00:03:14,800
Ayah?

18
00:03:16,903 --> 00:03:19,339
Ayah? Ayah!

19
00:03:40,025 --> 00:03:41,327
Father?

20
00:03:43,029 --> 00:03:44,331
Daddy?

21
00:03:51,036 --> 00:03:53,239
Time for our nap, Jemima.

22
00:04:13,191 --> 00:04:17,430
There were once two people
called Mary and Jemima.

23
00:04:20,266 --> 00:04:23,003
They spent their days
telling stories to each other.

24
00:04:25,504 --> 00:04:27,506
And then one day,

25
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,376
their mother and father
were kidnapped

26
00:04:30,408 --> 00:04:32,812
by the evil demon Ravana...

27
00:04:37,283 --> 00:04:39,453
...leaving them all alone.

28
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:36,542
As I understand it, her mother was
struck down with cholera very suddenly.

29
00:05:36,576 --> 00:05:39,045
Her father rushed her mother
to hospital.

30
00:05:39,078 --> 00:05:43,016
She died that night,
her father the following morning.

31
00:05:43,049 --> 00:05:45,084
She can't stay here.

32
00:05:45,117 --> 00:05:48,153
Well, she has
an uncle in England.

33
00:05:48,187 --> 00:05:50,790
We'll send her back
with the other children.

34
00:06:39,304 --> 00:06:41,174
It's disgusting.

35
00:06:42,374 --> 00:06:44,444
Then you're gonna be
very hungry.

36
00:06:44,477 --> 00:06:46,412
I never said
you could do that.

37
00:06:46,444 --> 00:06:50,884
You didn't say I couldn't.
If you weren't eating it, I will.

38
00:06:50,917 --> 00:06:54,220
You don't understand.
I need better food than this.

39
00:06:54,252 --> 00:06:56,521
My parents are dead.

40
00:06:56,554 --> 00:06:58,591
We've all lost, girl.

41
00:07:00,091 --> 00:07:02,060
Would you
like to hear a story?

42
00:07:02,093 --> 00:07:04,196
No. I'm not a kid.

43
00:07:07,566 --> 00:07:10,536
There once
was a lord of the seas.

44
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:13,340
His name was Varuna, and...

45
00:07:16,341 --> 00:07:17,543
he...

46
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,514
I'm not a kid.

47
00:08:06,624 --> 00:08:10,529
You are a plain little
piece of goods, aren't you?

48
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:15,335
Don't expect luxury.

49
00:08:16,134 --> 00:08:18,503
Misselthwaite is not
the place it was.

50
00:08:18,536 --> 00:08:24,176
Those army savages used it as a
hospital in the war, left it a wreck.

51
00:08:28,414 --> 00:08:30,383
Don't you care?

52
00:08:30,415 --> 00:08:32,584
Does it matter
if I care or not?

53
00:08:35,554 --> 00:08:37,958
You are an odd duck, aren't you?

54
00:08:48,067 --> 00:08:49,569
Is that the sea?

55
00:08:49,602 --> 00:08:51,603
No, it's the moors.

56
00:08:51,636 --> 00:08:54,741
Nothing lives on
but wild ponies and sheep.

57
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:08,221
And there you have it.
That's home.

58
00:09:08,788 --> 00:09:10,724
That's Misselthwaite.

59
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:16,228
And don't expect him
to come running, your uncle.

60
00:09:16,261 --> 00:09:18,164
He's had better days.

61
00:09:18,197 --> 00:09:20,667
And you're not to stare
when you see what afflicts him.

62
00:09:41,786 --> 00:09:46,626
First things first,
we are fully electric.

63
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:49,661
That doesn't mean
the electric always works.

64
00:09:49,694 --> 00:09:54,566
So, if you're needing the lavatory
in the night, you take a lamp.

65
00:09:54,599 --> 00:09:58,771
Secondly, Mr. Craven is
a widower and on his own.

66
00:09:58,804 --> 00:10:01,741
He's promised he'll have someone
to tend to you soon enough.

67
00:10:01,774 --> 00:10:05,545
But until then, don't be expecting
there'll be people to talk to,

68
00:10:05,578 --> 00:10:07,280
'cause there won't.

69
00:10:08,213 --> 00:10:12,218
I need no entertaining.
I'm not a child.

70
00:10:14,453 --> 00:10:15,788
Hmm.

71
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:19,591
You'll be told
what rooms you can go into,

72
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:22,361
and what rooms
you're to keep out of.

73
00:10:22,394 --> 00:10:27,133
But until then, you stick to
your rooms and your rooms only.

74
00:10:27,165 --> 00:10:32,104
No exploring, no poking about.

75
00:10:33,771 --> 00:10:35,775
I assure you, Mrs. Medlock,

76
00:10:35,808 --> 00:10:38,144
I've no interest
in "poking about."

77
00:10:40,246 --> 00:10:41,646
Hmm!

78
00:11:23,655 --> 00:11:24,824
Mother?

79
00:11:25,591 --> 00:11:30,597
I'm climbing.
Mother, look. Please!

80
00:11:42,741 --> 00:11:44,177
Hello?

81
00:11:57,423 --> 00:11:59,259
Is anybody there?

82
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:42,268
Hello?

83
00:12:44,703 --> 00:12:46,439
Is someone there?

84
00:13:05,623 --> 00:13:08,493
No, sir.
Please, leave those.

85
00:13:09,361 --> 00:13:11,598
The army will come
and collect them.

86
00:13:12,598 --> 00:13:14,333
Come on.

87
00:13:15,367 --> 00:13:16,769
Come inside.

88
00:13:26,978 --> 00:13:28,347
Who are you?

89
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,516
What's that for a greeting?

90
00:13:30,549 --> 00:13:33,920
You'll call me Martha.
And you're Mary, I hear.

91
00:13:39,724 --> 00:13:43,963
Brrr! Quite chilly today,
but spring is on its way.

92
00:13:43,996 --> 00:13:46,966
That's what my brother Dickon says.
He's always out on the moor.

93
00:13:46,998 --> 00:13:50,402
I was cold in the night
and no one heard my call.

94
00:13:50,435 --> 00:13:52,271
I'm guessing
we were sleeping too.

95
00:13:53,205 --> 00:13:57,944
And I heard noises.
Wailing. Screaming.

96
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:01,814
No, you heard the wind,
that's all.

97
00:14:01,847 --> 00:14:04,317
My Ayah would come
if I needed her.

98
00:14:04,349 --> 00:14:06,785
Whoever Ayah is,
she's sure as not here, is she?

99
00:14:08,386 --> 00:14:10,689
But aren't you going to be
my servant?

100
00:14:14,593 --> 00:14:16,695
I'm just
to check the fire's lit,

101
00:14:16,728 --> 00:14:19,398
the room's shipshape
and you've had food in you.

102
00:14:20,933 --> 00:14:23,636
Come on, get up and ready.
Your porridge is getting cold.

103
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,509
I don't eat porridge.

104
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,477
For my breakfast,
I like bacon and eggs.

105
00:14:32,511 --> 00:14:36,049
I like 'em too.
But you've got porridge. Now, eat.

106
00:14:37,116 --> 00:14:39,352
But you need to dress me.

107
00:14:42,154 --> 00:14:45,491
Dress you?
Do you not know how?

108
00:14:46,724 --> 00:14:49,961
Me mother always says she can't
see why grand people's children

109
00:14:49,995 --> 00:14:53,466
didn't turn out to be fools,
what with being washed and dressed

110
00:14:53,498 --> 00:14:55,801
and took out to walk
as if they were puppies.

111
00:14:58,536 --> 00:15:01,740
And there I was, excited to
have a young 'un in the house.

112
00:15:14,786 --> 00:15:17,756
It doesn't matter!
This is of no importance.

113
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:20,593
We can't just leave them
all piled up like this.

114
00:15:20,626 --> 00:15:23,129
Well, get rid of them! Throw them away.
Burn them. I don't care!

115
00:15:24,563 --> 00:15:26,699
The house will be better
without them!

116
00:15:29,468 --> 00:15:33,005
What about this one?
Please, I don't need to be reminded of her.

117
00:15:34,906 --> 00:15:36,376
She's gone.

118
00:16:12,578 --> 00:16:15,148
One, two...

119
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,119
Thirty-one...

120
00:16:21,152 --> 00:16:23,755
Fifty-seven, fifty-eight...

121
00:16:28,926 --> 00:16:32,431
Seventy-six, seventy-seven, seventy-eight...

122
00:16:33,665 --> 00:16:36,468
Hello?

123
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,776
Are you Martha's brother?

124
00:16:49,047 --> 00:16:50,149
Come back!

125
00:17:35,726 --> 00:17:36,795
No!

126
00:17:52,844 --> 00:17:57,316
There you are.
Now you're fed. You can go now.

127
00:18:00,251 --> 00:18:02,154
Don't you dare.
It's far too close!

128
00:18:05,957 --> 00:18:08,226
I want you to go!

129
00:18:24,643 --> 00:18:26,078
Of all the silly things.

130
00:18:27,745 --> 00:18:29,213
Are you following me?

131
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:35,687
Mary! Mary?

132
00:18:35,721 --> 00:18:39,124
Do you have a problem
with wild dogs on this manor?

133
00:18:39,156 --> 00:18:42,660
It is not a manor,
it is an estate.

134
00:18:42,694 --> 00:18:45,731
Of course we don't have
a problem with wild dogs.

135
00:18:45,763 --> 00:18:47,567
You're not
in the colonies now.

136
00:18:51,002 --> 00:18:56,140
And in future, your bath
will be ready at 5:25,

137
00:18:56,174 --> 00:18:59,679
and you'll be expected
to be in your room by then.

138
00:19:38,684 --> 00:19:41,953
Ayah,
please keep her quiet!

139
00:20:07,244 --> 00:20:09,247
Were you here
when the soldiers were?

140
00:20:10,214 --> 00:20:11,951
Did you work in the hospital?

141
00:20:19,491 --> 00:20:21,761
Soldiers died here, didn't they?

142
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:35,873
Please don't.

143
00:20:35,906 --> 00:20:37,775
You spoil the carpet
and your dress

144
00:20:37,809 --> 00:20:39,912
and it'll be me
has to clean both.

145
00:20:42,213 --> 00:20:45,050
The noises that
I hear in the night,

146
00:20:45,082 --> 00:20:48,019
do dead soldiers
haunt this house?

147
00:20:48,052 --> 00:20:51,089
If you hear noise,
then turn over and sleep more.

148
00:20:52,389 --> 00:20:54,259
I didn't ask to be here!

149
00:20:56,427 --> 00:20:59,030
And Mr. Craven didn't ask
to take you in,

150
00:20:59,063 --> 00:21:01,399
but he did all the same.

151
00:21:23,855 --> 00:21:24,890
Mrs. Pitcher?

152
00:21:26,323 --> 00:21:28,727
You gave me a sandwich
yesterday, for my luncheon.

153
00:21:29,561 --> 00:21:31,896
I need the same meat
in my sandwich today.

154
00:21:34,566 --> 00:21:35,835
Please?

155
00:22:06,397 --> 00:22:07,933
There you are.

156
00:22:14,138 --> 00:22:15,273
Hello.

157
00:22:15,307 --> 00:22:17,476
What's your name, then?

158
00:22:20,511 --> 00:22:23,848
Are you a girl dog or a boy dog?

159
00:22:27,184 --> 00:22:29,354
I think that you're a girl dog

160
00:22:29,386 --> 00:22:31,889
and I'm going to call you Jemima.

161
00:22:31,923 --> 00:22:33,425
Come on, Jemima!

162
00:23:07,959 --> 00:23:09,495
Wait for me!

163
00:23:13,932 --> 00:23:17,001
Where are you taking me? Jemima!

164
00:23:34,286 --> 00:23:36,488
So this is where you live.

165
00:23:36,521 --> 00:23:38,890
Mary!

166
00:23:38,924 --> 00:23:41,894
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Mary!

167
00:24:53,498 --> 00:24:55,000
I saw you.

168
00:24:59,203 --> 00:25:02,139
I can't say I saw enough
to identify you,

169
00:25:02,173 --> 00:25:05,410
but I'm sure if I were to say
the little servant girl,

170
00:25:05,443 --> 00:25:08,146
you'd be in firm trouble,
wouldn't you?

171
00:25:09,213 --> 00:25:11,015
I'm no servant.

172
00:25:11,683 --> 00:25:14,019
My name is Mary Lennox.

173
00:25:14,051 --> 00:25:16,687
My mother was sister to
the mistress of this house

174
00:25:16,721 --> 00:25:20,058
and my uncle owns it still, and you'll
do well to give me the respect I'm due.

175
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:25,597
I'll give you none. I'm Colin Craven
and the uncle you speak of is my father.

176
00:25:25,629 --> 00:25:28,367
If I were to live,
this place should belong to me.

177
00:25:29,334 --> 00:25:30,703
We're cousins.

178
00:25:32,369 --> 00:25:33,571
But I've
never heard of you.

179
00:25:33,605 --> 00:25:35,274
Nor I of you.

180
00:25:39,344 --> 00:25:40,679
You're very thin.

181
00:25:40,712 --> 00:25:42,780
You're very white.

182
00:25:42,813 --> 00:25:44,782
You smile with no teeth.

183
00:25:44,816 --> 00:25:46,485
Well, you don't smile
at all.

184
00:25:46,518 --> 00:25:47,685
Why are you here?

185
00:25:47,719 --> 00:25:49,254
Why shouldn't I be?

186
00:25:49,287 --> 00:25:51,556
I don't want a friend.

187
00:25:51,588 --> 00:25:54,659
I've plenty already.

188
00:25:57,162 --> 00:25:59,431
So you're the one
that cries at night.

189
00:25:59,463 --> 00:26:01,399
I thought this cursed house
was magic...

190
00:26:01,433 --> 00:26:03,368
You think the house cursed?

191
00:26:04,702 --> 00:26:07,071
By all the soldiers
that died here.

192
00:26:07,771 --> 00:26:11,577
No. The curse came
before the war.

193
00:26:12,444 --> 00:26:15,347
The reason they say
this house is cursed

194
00:26:15,379 --> 00:26:19,251
is because it killed my mother
and tried to kill me.

195
00:26:22,654 --> 00:26:26,657
My mother's dead too.
And I killed her.

196
00:26:27,392 --> 00:26:28,427
Did you really?

197
00:26:31,463 --> 00:26:35,567
Well, then we both
know tragedy... don't we?

198
00:26:45,542 --> 00:26:47,412
Daddy!

199
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:14,839
Wake up, girl.

200
00:27:14,873 --> 00:27:16,575
The master wants to see you.

201
00:27:20,845 --> 00:27:23,448
Come on, girl,
you can help more than you are.

202
00:27:23,481 --> 00:27:27,352
My mother would say you do
as little as fast as you can.

203
00:27:27,385 --> 00:27:29,754
I have decided
that I like your mother.

204
00:27:30,788 --> 00:27:34,659
You've never met her. Eat.

205
00:27:34,692 --> 00:27:38,130
I like your brother Dickon too,
and I have met him.

206
00:27:38,163 --> 00:27:42,200
Well, I would have, but he backed away.
I've seen him, at least.

207
00:27:42,232 --> 00:27:45,471
Dickon has problems enough of his
own without you to bother him.

208
00:27:47,405 --> 00:27:49,774
Don't worry, he won't like me.
No one does.

209
00:27:51,509 --> 00:27:53,545
And how do you
like yourself?

210
00:27:54,578 --> 00:27:56,580
Mother said that to me once.

211
00:27:56,614 --> 00:27:59,751
Put her in a bad temper and
she turns on me and she says,

212
00:27:59,783 --> 00:28:02,853
"There tha' stands saying tha'
doesn't like this one an' tha'.

213
00:28:02,886 --> 00:28:04,556
How does tha' like thysel'?"

214
00:28:04,588 --> 00:28:07,358
Not that I want to interrupt
this reminisce,

215
00:28:07,392 --> 00:28:09,561
but there are those
who are waiting on us.

216
00:28:09,594 --> 00:28:11,663
Mrs. Medlock, I'm sorry...
It's not her fault.

217
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:16,635
I was tardy.
She was scolding me for it.

218
00:28:18,636 --> 00:28:21,306
Well, it doesn't matter
whose fault it is.

219
00:28:21,338 --> 00:28:24,376
What matters is you're late.
Now, come on with you.

220
00:28:27,945 --> 00:28:32,583
Now, when he speaks to you,
you answer back with a "sir."

221
00:28:32,617 --> 00:28:35,953
Do you understand?
Yes, Mrs. Medlock.

222
00:28:35,986 --> 00:28:37,955
And if he wants to look at you,

223
00:28:37,989 --> 00:28:40,858
you let him look,
but don't stare back.

224
00:28:41,792 --> 00:28:45,229
And say nothing fanciful.
He's enough concerns.

225
00:28:48,966 --> 00:28:51,235
Come here, girl.

226
00:28:59,944 --> 00:29:02,848
Into the light,
where I can see you.

227
00:29:06,451 --> 00:29:09,588
Mrs. Medlock says
you're cluttering up the place.

228
00:29:10,355 --> 00:29:12,656
She'd have me
send you away to school.

229
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:16,361
I don't want that, sir.
I like it here.

230
00:29:17,595 --> 00:29:19,631
Then we will find you
a governess.

231
00:29:19,664 --> 00:29:22,434
No. I've no need
of a governess.

232
00:29:26,037 --> 00:29:28,840
I've too much to learn here
at Misselthwaite, sir.

233
00:29:33,645 --> 00:29:35,713
This place
has nothing to teach you.

234
00:29:42,353 --> 00:29:44,889
I want to play
out of doors.

235
00:29:44,922 --> 00:29:46,857
It was too hot
to do so in India.

236
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:48,792
I'm obliged by law
to have you taught.

237
00:29:48,826 --> 00:29:50,896
Then we'll need to
break the law, won't we?

238
00:30:00,838 --> 00:30:03,575
Mrs. Medlock says
she sees your mother in you.

239
00:30:05,376 --> 00:30:06,944
I'm not so sure.

240
00:30:06,978 --> 00:30:10,916
Did she like my mother?
Doesn't seem to like me.

241
00:30:15,353 --> 00:30:17,055
It's not your mother I see.

242
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:19,925
You see her twin.
Your wife.

243
00:30:21,526 --> 00:30:23,629
My mother
said the same once.

244
00:30:32,036 --> 00:30:35,774
If you do cause me trouble, I will have
you sent away to school in an instant.

245
00:30:35,807 --> 00:30:36,908
Do you understand?

246
00:30:39,609 --> 00:30:42,580
All women are destined to leave
Misselthwaite, one way or another.

247
00:30:44,848 --> 00:30:46,484
Go on, off you go.

248
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:52,523
I'm not to be sent to school
and I'm not to have a governess.

249
00:30:52,557 --> 00:30:55,894
- Are you not?
- Mr. Craven's orders.

250
00:30:55,926 --> 00:30:59,430
He doesn't want me to leave this cursed
house like all the other womenfolk.

251
00:31:00,732 --> 00:31:04,636
Please be sure to have Mrs. Pitcher
supply me with her special sandwiches.

252
00:31:04,668 --> 00:31:08,105
Extra meat.
It is a requirement.

253
00:31:08,138 --> 00:31:10,309
I need to grow.

254
00:31:16,713 --> 00:31:17,948
Hello.

255
00:31:20,684 --> 00:31:21,986
Jemima!

256
00:31:23,788 --> 00:31:25,390
Jemima!

257
00:31:31,863 --> 00:31:33,064
Jemima.

258
00:31:40,538 --> 00:31:41,772
No.

259
00:31:44,142 --> 00:31:45,977
Please don't.

260
00:32:08,698 --> 00:32:09,733
No!

261
00:34:07,752 --> 00:34:09,688
Jemima?

262
00:34:57,234 --> 00:34:58,670
Jemima?

263
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:08,112
Jemima!

264
00:35:20,758 --> 00:35:22,627
Hello.

265
00:35:23,928 --> 00:35:25,797
This is a mysterious place.

266
00:35:26,763 --> 00:35:28,932
Come back and we'll get
that wound better for you.

267
00:35:30,767 --> 00:35:32,903
The trap wasn't my fault.

268
00:35:37,274 --> 00:35:38,343
Very well.

269
00:36:12,443 --> 00:36:14,245
Can I see your paw, Jemima?

270
00:36:16,113 --> 00:36:18,249
I promise I won't hurt you.

271
00:36:22,352 --> 00:36:24,921
You don't want help?
That's fine.

272
00:36:24,955 --> 00:36:27,892
We'll deal with that later.

273
00:36:27,925 --> 00:36:29,961
We'll have an explore first.

274
00:36:43,006 --> 00:36:45,876
Keep up, Jemima.

275
00:36:55,185 --> 00:36:58,321
There were once two friends
called Mary and Jemima,

276
00:36:58,354 --> 00:37:00,857
and they discovered
a mysterious garden.

277
00:37:41,164 --> 00:37:44,034
Hello to you too.

278
00:37:44,068 --> 00:37:47,171
No, don't hurt him.
It's just a friendly robin.

279
00:38:03,854 --> 00:38:05,890
What is it?

280
00:38:19,068 --> 00:38:21,038
That's as good an idea
as you've had.

281
00:38:39,923 --> 00:38:41,325
Mary!

282
00:38:42,827 --> 00:38:44,896
I'll be back tomorrow
to see to that leg.

283
00:39:17,193 --> 00:39:18,862
Mary!

284
00:39:20,631 --> 00:39:22,000
Mary!

285
00:39:28,638 --> 00:39:30,008
But...

286
00:39:31,609 --> 00:39:34,412
you've dirt all over you,

287
00:39:34,444 --> 00:39:38,816
and your hair's matted
and wet.

288
00:39:39,584 --> 00:39:43,354
Mr. Craven said to play.
I'm playing.

289
00:40:02,272 --> 00:40:04,207
Colin...
No!

290
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,443
Lie still.
No, please.

291
00:40:06,477 --> 00:40:09,881
I don't like it.
It tastes horrid, please!

292
00:40:09,914 --> 00:40:13,450
I know you don't like
it, but it's going to make you well.

293
00:40:13,484 --> 00:40:16,254
- Please. Please!
- You know very well,

294
00:40:16,287 --> 00:40:19,390
it's either the medicine
or the brace.

295
00:40:21,292 --> 00:40:25,363
Come on.
It'll soon be over. Just...

296
00:40:25,396 --> 00:40:27,964
Please!
I don't like it.

297
00:40:27,997 --> 00:40:29,966
It tastes horrid.
I don't like it.

298
00:40:29,999 --> 00:40:32,402
I'll come back
later when you've calmed down.

299
00:41:00,129 --> 00:41:04,935
Sometimes I need to be
restrained, or medicated.

300
00:41:05,702 --> 00:41:08,338
My father says
it's for my own benefit.

301
00:41:08,372 --> 00:41:11,142
Although I rarely see him.
He's always too busy.

302
00:41:14,678 --> 00:41:16,380
I thought
you wouldn't visit again.

303
00:41:16,412 --> 00:41:18,115
That's your chair?

304
00:41:18,147 --> 00:41:20,483
It's none of your business!
Don't touch it!

305
00:41:20,517 --> 00:41:25,556
Oh, it's good. Moves well.
Do you use it much?

306
00:41:25,589 --> 00:41:29,627
I'm afraid I can't.
You've seen my father's hunchback.

307
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,729
Well, mine is worse.
I've never been able to walk.

308
00:41:31,761 --> 00:41:33,964
Shall we use the chair
to explore? I can push...

309
00:41:33,997 --> 00:41:35,300
Your cousin is dying.

310
00:41:39,435 --> 00:41:41,405
You don't look like
someone who's dying.

311
00:41:41,437 --> 00:41:43,407
And how many dying people
have you seen?

312
00:41:45,475 --> 00:41:48,646
We could go outside and, who
knows, you might feel better.

313
00:41:48,678 --> 00:41:50,714
Once they tried
to take me outside,

314
00:41:50,747 --> 00:41:53,316
and the stench of the roses
almost killed me.

315
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:57,655
You're afraid of flowers?
That isn't very sensible.

316
00:42:08,265 --> 00:42:12,002
What if I were to tell you
that I know of a magical place?

317
00:42:12,035 --> 00:42:13,436
Where the birds
sing for you

318
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:15,071
and a friendly dog
plays with you?

319
00:42:15,104 --> 00:42:17,507
I'd say that you were lying.

320
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:19,075
And I'm not interested,

321
00:42:19,109 --> 00:42:20,544
even if you are
telling the truth.

322
00:42:20,577 --> 00:42:22,546
But...
I'm tired now. You can go.

323
00:42:23,479 --> 00:42:24,647
What?

324
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,349
I'm tired.

325
00:42:26,383 --> 00:42:28,519
You're not listening to me.
Please leave.

326
00:42:28,551 --> 00:42:31,155
I'm not your play toy to be
put down when you choose!

327
00:42:31,187 --> 00:42:32,689
You came to me.
I never invited you in.

328
00:42:32,722 --> 00:42:35,158
I told you secrets
about my magic place.

329
00:42:35,191 --> 00:42:37,327
Secrets I didn't care
to know of.

330
00:42:38,162 --> 00:42:39,564
Now get off my bed
and leave me alone.

331
00:42:54,711 --> 00:42:56,513
Is that your mother?

332
00:42:56,546 --> 00:42:58,215
You were leaving.

333
00:43:00,484 --> 00:43:02,453
They say I look like her.

334
00:43:02,486 --> 00:43:05,423
I hate her for doing it.
Dying.

335
00:43:06,122 --> 00:43:07,457
Hate her?

336
00:43:08,392 --> 00:43:12,562
My mother loved me hugely.
Everyone said so.

337
00:43:15,198 --> 00:43:18,702
And then she died,
leaving me all alone.

338
00:43:20,571 --> 00:43:22,306
It's unforgivable.

339
00:43:24,307 --> 00:43:26,143
Well, my mother
never loved me.

340
00:43:27,711 --> 00:43:31,816
Will you read to me?
As I try to fall asleep?

341
00:43:31,848 --> 00:43:33,584
I struggle to sleep.

342
00:43:35,151 --> 00:43:37,088
I know...

343
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,189
I'll tell you a story
about gods

344
00:43:39,222 --> 00:43:40,690
and a quarrel
over who first made fire.

345
00:43:40,723 --> 00:43:42,526
That sounds terrible.

346
00:43:44,227 --> 00:43:45,562
Read me this.

347
00:43:45,595 --> 00:43:48,131
What are you laughing about?

348
00:43:48,164 --> 00:43:50,534
You might be the rudest boy
I've ever met.

349
00:46:48,312 --> 00:46:49,613
Perfectly all right.

350
00:46:49,646 --> 00:46:51,515
But you've not eaten anything.

351
00:46:51,548 --> 00:46:53,251
Please don't fuss!

352
00:46:55,618 --> 00:46:59,289
Martha, can you tell me
about my Aunt Grace?

353
00:46:59,323 --> 00:47:01,759
Your mother didn't talk
of her sister at all?

354
00:47:02,926 --> 00:47:04,962
She never talked of England.

355
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:08,932
Thick as thieves, they were.

356
00:47:09,867 --> 00:47:12,303
<i>The crying I heard
when it was announced</i>

357
00:47:12,336 --> 00:47:14,638
<i>your father
was to be posted to India.</i>

358
00:47:17,473 --> 00:47:19,843
I served at the last ball
they had here.

359
00:47:24,046 --> 00:47:26,617
To see them dance...

360
00:47:26,649 --> 00:47:28,952
This house
was filled with light,

361
00:47:28,984 --> 00:47:31,921
laughter, happiness.

362
00:47:36,993 --> 00:47:38,862
Your poor mother.

363
00:47:38,894 --> 00:47:41,498
I don't know how
she coped to lose her.

364
00:47:45,535 --> 00:47:47,605
I don't think
she ever recovered.

365
00:47:49,805 --> 00:47:51,941
Mummy,
I have a new story for you.

366
00:47:51,975 --> 00:47:54,578
No, darling,
I just need to be alone.

367
00:47:57,013 --> 00:47:59,950
- Mommy!
- Please go away!

368
00:47:59,982 --> 00:48:01,718
Come on, Miss.
Mother!

369
00:48:01,752 --> 00:48:04,688
Mary! Mary, please, darling,
leave your mother in peace.

370
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,490
Why won't she see me?
What's wrong with me?

371
00:48:07,524 --> 00:48:10,694
She's just sick, that's all.

372
00:48:10,727 --> 00:48:13,597
Then why doesn't she get on and
die, leave us all alone?

373
00:48:25,609 --> 00:48:27,544
You needn't trouble with
dressing me this morning.

374
00:48:27,577 --> 00:48:29,080
I can manage.

375
00:48:33,015 --> 00:48:34,584
Jemima?

376
00:48:38,821 --> 00:48:39,923
Jemima!

377
00:48:43,727 --> 00:48:44,795
Dickon?

378
00:48:46,729 --> 00:48:47,997
Stop!

379
00:48:51,435 --> 00:48:52,937
I know it's you, Dickon.

380
00:48:56,807 --> 00:48:59,443
And unless you want me to instruct
your sister to box your ears...

381
00:48:59,475 --> 00:49:01,979
My sister loves me
much more than you.

382
00:49:02,011 --> 00:49:05,048
She won't love you so much when she
knows you're poaching on the moor.

383
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,149
Poaching?

384
00:49:08,084 --> 00:49:09,653
I were not.

385
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:17,127
You ran from me.
That says guilt.

386
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,663
Guilt for what you did
to my Jemima.

387
00:49:20,597 --> 00:49:22,966
I'm not sure your dog
would like the name Jemima,

388
00:49:22,999 --> 00:49:24,968
being as he's a boy.

389
00:49:25,001 --> 00:49:27,136
A boy? It doesn't matter.

390
00:49:27,169 --> 00:49:29,106
His paw was trapped
in a horror trap.

391
00:49:29,138 --> 00:49:30,874
Tell me where I'd find him.

392
00:49:32,175 --> 00:49:33,843
Why should I trust you?

393
00:49:33,877 --> 00:49:35,679
I know how
to make him better.

394
00:49:35,711 --> 00:49:36,980
Trust that.

395
00:49:39,216 --> 00:49:40,951
I need you to keep a secret.

396
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:45,122
On my honor I'll keep it.

397
00:49:49,158 --> 00:49:51,194
Why have you
just spat on yourself?

398
00:49:51,227 --> 00:49:55,732
You spit too. Then we shake.
Then we're bonded.

399
00:49:57,533 --> 00:49:59,769
If you're too much of a lady, then there's no...

400
00:50:00,604 --> 00:50:01,806
I'm no lady, sir.

401
00:50:15,185 --> 00:50:18,055
And it's my secret,
so you're to keep it.

402
00:50:18,088 --> 00:50:20,156
You're just here
to help with the dog.

403
00:50:29,932 --> 00:50:30,967
Wow.

404
00:50:32,968 --> 00:50:34,070
This way!

405
00:50:41,678 --> 00:50:43,747
Can you do this?

406
00:51:02,164 --> 00:51:03,199
Look at this.

407
00:51:15,644 --> 00:51:16,879
Hello, fella.

408
00:51:17,981 --> 00:51:20,183
How'd you get here?

409
00:51:20,216 --> 00:51:22,019
Master not come back
from the war?

410
00:51:22,051 --> 00:51:24,088
Do you think
he lost his home?

411
00:51:28,725 --> 00:51:29,927
I'll do you no harm.

412
00:51:32,963 --> 00:51:34,031
Hey...

413
00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:42,873
What are you doing?
You tricked me.

414
00:51:42,906 --> 00:51:44,708
Hold the head.
This was all a trick!

415
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:46,776
If we don't see to this now,
he'll lose his leg,

416
00:51:46,810 --> 00:51:48,812
and chances are, his life.

417
00:51:52,214 --> 00:51:53,783
Careful, now.

418
00:51:56,352 --> 00:51:57,620
He trusts you.

419
00:51:58,988 --> 00:52:02,258
Nothing's broken,
but it looks like it's going rotten.

420
00:52:02,292 --> 00:52:04,127
Is there running water here?

421
00:52:28,984 --> 00:52:30,588
That's really good, that.

422
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,402
Feel better, does it, sir?

423
00:52:49,439 --> 00:52:50,941
Up.

424
00:53:02,285 --> 00:53:04,021
Dickon, you haven't
fixed anything.

425
00:53:04,854 --> 00:53:07,690
You've made it worse.
Just give it time.

426
00:53:07,723 --> 00:53:09,091
Both of you.

427
00:53:09,124 --> 00:53:10,793
We've done all we can.

428
00:53:14,164 --> 00:53:16,734
We're hoping the garden
will magic him well?

429
00:53:17,934 --> 00:53:19,403
Come morning,
we'll have an answer.

430
00:53:30,146 --> 00:53:35,185
It has a lake? You wouldn't call it a
lake, but a pond maybe, and a stream.

431
00:53:35,218 --> 00:53:38,922
Now, promise to spit?

432
00:53:38,955 --> 00:53:41,225
You may need to educate me
on how to spit.

433
00:53:48,263 --> 00:53:49,666
Surprisingly simple.

434
00:53:53,870 --> 00:53:56,373
I've spit
and I won't tell a soul.

435
00:53:56,406 --> 00:53:59,176
Now, tell me everything
about your dog.

436
00:53:59,209 --> 00:54:02,011
Does he love the garden?
Is he trained?

437
00:54:02,044 --> 00:54:04,447
In fact, I've a book
on dog training.

438
00:54:04,481 --> 00:54:07,450
It's on that chair over there.
Fetch it.

439
00:54:14,423 --> 00:54:16,759
When was the last time
you used your chair?

440
00:54:17,926 --> 00:54:19,463
Fetch me my book...

441
00:54:19,495 --> 00:54:21,397
I don't believe your back
is half as bad as you make out.

442
00:54:21,430 --> 00:54:22,932
And I know
you didn't kill your mother.

443
00:54:22,966 --> 00:54:24,702
So who is the bigger liar?

444
00:54:27,504 --> 00:54:29,373
Did you ask after me?

445
00:54:32,408 --> 00:54:34,444
I said I'd heard you.

446
00:54:35,446 --> 00:54:38,781
They said you'd lost
both your parents tragically.

447
00:54:38,814 --> 00:54:41,452
They were very clear
you weren't a murderess.

448
00:54:55,899 --> 00:54:57,367
Do you trust me?

449
00:54:58,368 --> 00:55:00,837
I've something to show you.

450
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:02,506
Why would I trust you?

451
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:08,477
You'll damage my back.

452
00:55:08,510 --> 00:55:10,179
I wished her death,
and it happened.

453
00:55:10,213 --> 00:55:12,783
I'm absolutely her murderer.
Okay, fine. I believe you.

454
00:55:12,816 --> 00:55:15,484
But if you take me to that
garden, you'll murder me too.

455
00:55:15,517 --> 00:55:18,021
Of course I'm not taking you
into the garden.

456
00:55:20,522 --> 00:55:22,792
There's something
you need to see.

457
00:55:24,928 --> 00:55:27,998
I was three years old
when your mother died,

458
00:55:28,031 --> 00:55:30,067
and you and I
are almost the same age.

459
00:55:38,908 --> 00:55:40,477
Was this
my mother's room?

460
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:44,914
No. No, take me back!

461
00:55:44,948 --> 00:55:46,250
You should see these.

462
00:55:48,084 --> 00:55:51,254
No, don't be scared.
You'll like them.

463
00:55:51,287 --> 00:55:53,457
Your mother. My mother.

464
00:55:55,258 --> 00:55:58,194
She came. Don't you see?

465
00:55:58,227 --> 00:56:01,097
I don't want to see.
To Misselthwaite, to visit your mother.

466
00:56:02,531 --> 00:56:04,934
She wanted to see her
before she died.

467
00:56:05,935 --> 00:56:07,370
And look.

468
00:56:07,403 --> 00:56:09,406
No, I don't want to look!

469
00:56:09,439 --> 00:56:11,008
Can you see?

470
00:56:14,577 --> 00:56:16,847
They're inside
the secret garden.

471
00:56:25,053 --> 00:56:28,524
Don't be afraid. Look.

472
00:56:33,528 --> 00:56:36,165
- And we're there too.
- No!

473
00:56:37,533 --> 00:56:40,103
I've been
to Misselthwaite before.

474
00:56:40,135 --> 00:56:43,105
So we did know of each other.

475
00:56:43,138 --> 00:56:45,107
Isn't that extraordinary?

476
00:56:46,008 --> 00:56:48,145
And do you know
what's even more extraordinary?

477
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:53,215
You're walking.

478
00:56:53,249 --> 00:56:54,984
How dare you!

479
00:56:55,017 --> 00:56:57,220
This is just jealousy
because my mother loved me.

480
00:56:57,252 --> 00:56:59,488
Well, you don't deserve
a mother's love!

481
00:57:17,707 --> 00:57:19,509
Colin? Are you okay?

482
00:57:20,943 --> 00:57:22,178
Where does it hurt?

483
00:57:28,450 --> 00:57:30,486
You don't even
have a hunchback.

484
00:57:32,655 --> 00:57:34,357
Of course I do.

485
00:57:36,258 --> 00:57:38,327
Your back's just the same
as mine.

486
00:57:41,698 --> 00:57:45,269
I swear on your mother's life,
I can't see it there at all.

487
00:58:01,718 --> 00:58:04,221
Come on, let's get you up.

488
00:58:14,464 --> 00:58:17,100
Careful.
You tell me to be careful?

489
00:58:49,064 --> 00:58:50,265
Have you seen him?

490
00:58:51,566 --> 00:58:53,235
He's better!

491
00:58:53,269 --> 00:58:56,606
He still has a limp,
but the leg takes his weight.

492
00:58:56,638 --> 00:58:58,341
The garden has cured him.

493
00:58:58,374 --> 00:59:00,010
It had some help.

494
00:59:00,042 --> 00:59:03,079
No, Dickon.
This is a magic garden.

495
00:59:05,515 --> 00:59:07,783
What are you doing?
I'm a Yorkshire terrier.

496
00:59:07,816 --> 00:59:09,519
Then I'm
a Yorkshire terrier too.

497
00:59:09,551 --> 00:59:12,187
Ruff!

498
01:00:01,604 --> 01:00:03,106
Mary!

499
01:00:08,644 --> 01:00:11,214
The robin's helped us
find a gate.

500
01:00:18,588 --> 01:00:20,156
It's locked.

501
01:00:20,789 --> 01:00:22,458
Not for long.

502
01:00:55,591 --> 01:00:57,660
Who's there?

503
01:00:57,693 --> 01:00:59,495
It's the girl, isn't it?

504
01:00:59,528 --> 01:01:01,296
My name's Mary,
and you know it.

505
01:01:01,330 --> 01:01:03,232
I don't want you here!

506
01:01:03,265 --> 01:01:05,568
I don't want to see you.
You're cruel!

507
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:09,405
We're past this, Colin. You'll scream.
I'll scream. No good will come of it.

508
01:01:17,213 --> 01:01:19,548
They catch you in here,
they'll have you whipped.

509
01:01:19,582 --> 01:01:21,850
It's worth the risk.

510
01:01:21,883 --> 01:01:25,187
You risk being sent to school.
We risk far more.

511
01:01:27,356 --> 01:01:29,758
Don't worry yourself, Mrs.
Medlock. I'll deal with him.

512
01:01:29,792 --> 01:01:32,395
Never normally causes bother
at this hour.

513
01:01:32,428 --> 01:01:35,198
I'll take care of it, Mrs. Medlock.
You continue with your chores.

514
01:01:35,830 --> 01:01:37,767
Such a lot to do.

515
01:01:46,709 --> 01:01:48,310
Do that and you'll
never see me again.

516
01:01:50,479 --> 01:01:51,915
It's your decision.

517
01:01:54,450 --> 01:01:55,919
This is Dickon.

518
01:01:55,952 --> 01:01:57,287
Hello.

519
01:01:59,988 --> 01:02:01,256
He's handsome.

520
01:02:01,289 --> 01:02:03,359
And he can whistle.

521
01:02:05,595 --> 01:02:08,631
When's the next time they'll check on him?
I'll bring him his lunch,

522
01:02:08,664 --> 01:02:10,899
then come back a little after
4:00 to check he's eaten.

523
01:02:10,932 --> 01:02:12,501
I'm not going!

524
01:02:13,836 --> 01:02:15,338
You know what you risk?

525
01:02:15,370 --> 01:02:17,206
He'll be back in his room
by 4:00.

526
01:02:27,783 --> 01:02:29,452
I'm not going!

527
01:02:29,484 --> 01:02:32,955
When we tried to fix the dog,
he refused us too.

528
01:02:32,988 --> 01:02:35,457
Take his legs, Dickon.
I'll take the arms.

529
01:02:40,396 --> 01:02:43,232
Or... we can get you
in the chair,

530
01:02:43,265 --> 01:02:44,867
get you down safely.

531
01:02:47,035 --> 01:02:48,804
I promise you
we won't kill you.

532
01:02:48,838 --> 01:02:50,872
You can't promise
anything of the kind!

533
01:02:50,906 --> 01:02:52,375
You'll die in this bed,

534
01:02:52,408 --> 01:02:54,743
and all you'll have seen
is the wallpaper.

535
01:02:54,776 --> 01:02:56,812
Is that really what you want?

536
01:03:29,544 --> 01:03:30,914
Where's Dickon?

537
01:03:32,914 --> 01:03:34,650
You're going too fast.

538
01:03:37,687 --> 01:03:39,422
You're too fast!

539
01:03:43,825 --> 01:03:46,361
Stop that!
It's the pollen, I told you.

540
01:03:46,394 --> 01:03:47,530
Take a breath.

541
01:03:51,901 --> 01:03:53,736
Still alive?
Yes, but...

542
01:03:53,769 --> 01:03:55,604
We'll work out what hurts
and what doesn't.

543
01:03:55,638 --> 01:03:58,775
But you have to try,
just as I do.

544
01:03:58,807 --> 01:04:00,709
Does that sound fair?

545
01:04:01,943 --> 01:04:03,012
Good.

546
01:04:09,952 --> 01:04:13,622
Mary, the wall.
Stop! The wall!

547
01:04:49,925 --> 01:04:52,562
Dickon, what are those called?

548
01:04:54,763 --> 01:04:56,365
Hydrangea.

549
01:04:56,399 --> 01:04:59,068
Hydrangea.

550
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:00,669
And those?

551
01:05:02,470 --> 01:05:04,740
- Hypericum.
- Hypericum.

552
01:05:05,475 --> 01:05:07,643
They sound better
in your accent.

553
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:15,585
Colin, there's a good friend
I'd like you to meet.

554
01:05:16,919 --> 01:05:21,124
Hold it out and he'll come.
He's here? The dog?

555
01:05:21,156 --> 01:05:22,725
Just hold it out.

556
01:05:22,758 --> 01:05:25,627
He wants to say hello.
I can see.

557
01:05:34,068 --> 01:05:36,738
- He took it from my hand.
- He did.

558
01:05:36,772 --> 01:05:39,409
- And now he's licking my hand.
- He does that.

559
01:05:39,441 --> 01:05:40,809
It tickles.

560
01:05:42,510 --> 01:05:43,879
He's not diseased?

561
01:05:44,747 --> 01:05:46,649
Not that we've seen.

562
01:05:49,118 --> 01:05:50,886
What's his name?

563
01:05:50,919 --> 01:05:52,588
He was called Jemima.

564
01:05:54,089 --> 01:05:55,492
Till she knew different.

565
01:05:56,091 --> 01:06:00,096
Now he's... Dog.

566
01:06:00,129 --> 01:06:02,698
He needs a better name than that.

567
01:06:02,731 --> 01:06:04,033
Perhaps we should...

568
01:06:05,033 --> 01:06:06,568
What's your father called?

569
01:06:08,236 --> 01:06:12,642
Marcus. Can we not
name him after him?

570
01:06:12,675 --> 01:06:16,479
We should not name him
after my father either.

571
01:06:16,511 --> 01:06:21,417
My father was called Hector,
and he was a brave man.

572
01:06:22,051 --> 01:06:23,787
Was?

573
01:06:26,754 --> 01:06:28,790
Settled. Hector.

574
01:06:28,823 --> 01:06:30,859
Mary and Dickon
you know already.

575
01:06:30,892 --> 01:06:32,994
Well, I'm Colin,
and I'm your new friend.

576
01:07:14,769 --> 01:07:16,538
Oh!

577
01:07:33,756 --> 01:07:36,959
You think
you just can sneak about

578
01:07:36,992 --> 01:07:39,562
and act how you like,
don't you?

579
01:07:39,595 --> 01:07:42,131
Little savage girl.

580
01:07:42,164 --> 01:07:44,533
I knew
you were hiding something.

581
01:07:44,566 --> 01:07:49,304
You and your secret ways
and your... deviance.

582
01:07:49,338 --> 01:07:52,207
Mrs. Medlock, whatever you think
I've been doing, I promise...

583
01:07:53,676 --> 01:07:55,044
Thieving.

584
01:07:56,278 --> 01:07:57,780
That the sort
of barbarous behavior

585
01:07:57,812 --> 01:07:59,982
you learnt out there,
is it?

586
01:08:01,617 --> 01:08:03,084
Where did you find them?

587
01:08:03,118 --> 01:08:05,021
Underneath a floorboard.
Where are you taking me?

588
01:08:05,053 --> 01:08:06,888
You understand these pearls
mean something to me?

589
01:08:06,922 --> 01:08:08,190
I'm sorry.
She's been everywhere.

590
01:08:08,222 --> 01:08:10,158
To the boy too.

591
01:08:10,191 --> 01:08:12,761
His wheelchair was skew-whiff
when I went in this morning.

592
01:08:12,794 --> 01:08:15,797
It's this roused my suspicions.
She's found my son too?

593
01:08:15,830 --> 01:08:18,199
Have we just given her
the full run of the house?

594
01:08:18,232 --> 01:08:20,669
I warned you
what a young girl could do.

595
01:08:20,703 --> 01:08:23,940
Was it not explained to you to stay
away from the parts of the house

596
01:08:23,972 --> 01:08:25,640
that were not yours
to roam in?

597
01:08:25,673 --> 01:08:27,609
Colin is my friend.

598
01:08:27,642 --> 01:08:29,645
I just thought that if I
could excite him about life...

599
01:08:29,677 --> 01:08:32,582
Your excitement could kill him.
Do you think he wants that?

600
01:08:47,395 --> 01:08:49,298
Oh, what have you done?

601
01:08:50,132 --> 01:08:51,334
Mrs. Medlock,

602
01:08:52,368 --> 01:08:55,104
let's look into finding
a school for my niece.

603
01:08:55,137 --> 01:08:56,673
Please.

604
01:08:57,972 --> 01:09:00,075
I was trying
to make things better.

605
01:09:00,109 --> 01:09:03,879
Find somewhere to
educate some civility into her.

606
01:09:14,656 --> 01:09:16,324
You locked me in!

607
01:09:16,357 --> 01:09:18,660
If you'll be
needing the lavatory in the night,

608
01:09:18,694 --> 01:09:21,230
you'll find we've provided you
with a chamber pot.

609
01:09:21,262 --> 01:09:23,164
It's under the bed.

610
01:09:23,198 --> 01:09:25,767
Martha will let you out
in the morning.

611
01:11:21,115 --> 01:11:23,118
Hey! Where are you going, girl?

612
01:11:26,355 --> 01:11:27,388
Mary!

613
01:11:27,422 --> 01:11:28,991
Follow me!

614
01:11:37,231 --> 01:11:39,167
Mary, what's wrong?

615
01:11:42,070 --> 01:11:44,206
There are even more secrets
to this garden!

616
01:12:17,205 --> 01:12:19,208
So Colin's mother
was dying?

617
01:12:20,275 --> 01:12:21,577
Yes.

618
01:12:21,610 --> 01:12:24,280
And you think
she came here?

619
01:12:24,312 --> 01:12:28,184
My mother came to be with her in
the last days of Grace's illness,

620
01:12:28,217 --> 01:12:30,953
knowing that she wanted to die
by this tree.

621
01:12:32,855 --> 01:12:34,957
After which, Mr. Craven...

622
01:12:34,989 --> 01:12:37,993
He shut the garden away because
memories of her caused too much pain.

623
01:12:40,494 --> 01:12:43,498
We don't have long.
They're sending me to school.

624
01:12:43,531 --> 01:12:45,301
No?

625
01:12:45,333 --> 01:12:49,805
This is Grace's garden,
and it needs to cure her son.

626
01:13:23,437 --> 01:13:25,874
It's cold.

627
01:13:27,042 --> 01:13:29,044
It's very, very cold.

628
01:13:32,213 --> 01:13:34,917
I don't think I can.
Course you can.

629
01:13:37,919 --> 01:13:40,922
I don't think I can.
We've got you.

630
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:48,296
I suppose it's not so freezing.

631
01:13:48,329 --> 01:13:49,397
That's the way.

632
01:13:56,038 --> 01:13:59,008
I've done it. I've done it!

633
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:02,378
Now hold your arms out
and lie back.

634
01:14:06,147 --> 01:14:09,185
And now...
you're on your own.

635
01:14:39,381 --> 01:14:42,017
Done. Over there, please.

636
01:14:44,552 --> 01:14:47,488
What are you
laughing about?

637
01:14:47,521 --> 01:14:49,658
Just enjoying
your happiness.

638
01:14:49,690 --> 01:14:51,492
We're all happy, aren't we?

639
01:14:51,525 --> 01:14:53,595
We are pirates.

640
01:14:53,628 --> 01:14:55,464
We're lords.

641
01:14:55,497 --> 01:14:59,435
We're conquerors
of this fair and beautiful land.

642
01:14:59,467 --> 01:15:01,970
This is our garden
and we love it.

643
01:15:04,105 --> 01:15:06,007
No.

644
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:10,046
It's not our garden,
and it never can be.

645
01:15:12,114 --> 01:15:14,150
There's something
I have to show you.

646
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:28,297
Stop. Stop!

647
01:15:30,632 --> 01:15:33,102
You know
what happened here, then?

648
01:15:33,135 --> 01:15:35,604
Why would you
bring me here?

649
01:15:35,637 --> 01:15:37,373
Because you needed to see it.

650
01:15:37,405 --> 01:15:40,609
Would you like to see the
place your mother died?

651
01:15:40,641 --> 01:15:44,245
My mother died in a hospital,
alone and in pain.

652
01:15:44,279 --> 01:15:46,515
Your mother
found a far better spot.

653
01:15:49,150 --> 01:15:51,319
Dickon, can you
fetch me some flowers?

654
01:15:51,787 --> 01:15:53,489
The white ones.

655
01:15:53,521 --> 01:15:56,624
And then can you take me home?
I don't want to be here.

656
01:15:56,658 --> 01:15:58,560
You don't understand.

657
01:15:58,592 --> 01:16:01,662
She died here
because it was beautiful,

658
01:16:01,695 --> 01:16:04,199
and so she made
this place magical.

659
01:16:05,266 --> 01:16:07,135
It cured Hector's leg, and I...

660
01:16:07,168 --> 01:16:10,038
I didn't want to see the dresses
and I don't want to see this.

661
01:16:10,071 --> 01:16:12,374
Please, take me home.

662
01:17:20,574 --> 01:17:22,811
Oof! Hello, monkey.

663
01:17:25,814 --> 01:17:27,682
Is something troubling you?

664
01:17:29,684 --> 01:17:34,656
Your mother...
is sad at the moment.

665
01:17:36,857 --> 01:17:41,363
Her sadness
has made her unwell.

666
01:17:42,430 --> 01:17:44,333
It's not her fault.

667
01:17:51,539 --> 01:17:54,275
I'm sorry.
I didn't understand.

668
01:18:00,781 --> 01:18:02,751
Not today!

669
01:18:02,784 --> 01:18:04,686
Colin, I've found these
letters from my mother to your mother.

670
01:18:04,718 --> 01:18:05,753
I don't want you today!

671
01:18:05,787 --> 01:18:07,155
All about you.

672
01:18:07,189 --> 01:18:08,423
And I don't want
that garden!

673
01:18:08,455 --> 01:18:10,592
You need to hear this.

674
01:18:10,624 --> 01:18:12,895
They talk about how your father
is focusing all his fears

675
01:18:12,927 --> 01:18:15,330
about your mother's illness
onto you.

676
01:18:17,832 --> 01:18:21,270
How he seems set on
protecting you from the world.

677
01:18:22,837 --> 01:18:24,740
And she's scared...

678
01:18:26,473 --> 01:18:28,878
of the damage he'll
do to you when she's gone.

679
01:18:36,751 --> 01:18:38,620
Should you be...

680
01:18:45,293 --> 01:18:46,795
I need to read those letters.

681
01:18:48,430 --> 01:18:50,466
You walked.

682
01:18:59,740 --> 01:19:01,475
Listen to this.

683
01:19:01,508 --> 01:19:03,578
"She's bold, slightly dangerous,

684
01:19:03,611 --> 01:19:05,980
and she has a spirit
that nothing can quench.

685
01:19:06,013 --> 01:19:08,617
I'd be scared for her
if I wasn't so proud of her."

686
01:19:08,650 --> 01:19:11,353
Who's bold?
She loved you, Mary.

687
01:19:12,854 --> 01:19:15,757
She wanted me nowhere near her.
Maybe that's...

688
01:19:15,789 --> 01:19:18,493
"I'm so pleased Colin
is making you laugh so.

689
01:19:18,525 --> 01:19:20,528
A whole day
pretending to be a dog.

690
01:19:20,561 --> 01:19:21,930
What a delight."

691
01:19:21,962 --> 01:19:23,698
A dog, was it?

692
01:19:23,731 --> 01:19:25,900
"Archie sounds deeper in love
than I've ever heard a man.

693
01:19:25,934 --> 01:19:29,404
He's just as besotted
as I am with Mary."

694
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:35,676
My father wants me
locked in a room.

695
01:19:35,709 --> 01:19:37,812
That's the thing, isn't it?

696
01:19:37,846 --> 01:19:40,649
Loss changes people.

697
01:19:40,681 --> 01:19:41,916
Even your mother, Mary.

698
01:19:41,949 --> 01:19:43,551
You don't know my mother.

699
01:19:43,584 --> 01:19:46,254
But I know
what it means to lose someone.

700
01:19:49,524 --> 01:19:51,026
Listen to this one, Mary.

701
01:19:51,059 --> 01:19:54,262
"She did a puppet show for me
the night before last.

702
01:19:54,296 --> 01:19:56,565
An elaborate affair
that required Ayah

703
01:19:56,597 --> 01:19:59,033
to make some silk curtains.

704
01:19:59,066 --> 01:20:01,035
She told this
Indian myth story.

705
01:20:01,069 --> 01:20:03,339
It was quite mesmerizing."

706
01:20:05,006 --> 01:20:09,378
I hadn't read that.
She wrote about my plays?

707
01:20:18,953 --> 01:20:20,888
Maybe he's right.

708
01:20:20,922 --> 01:20:23,492
Maybe neither of us
knew our parents well.

709
01:20:27,361 --> 01:20:28,564
No.

710
01:20:30,097 --> 01:20:32,301
She couldn't have loved me.

711
01:20:32,333 --> 01:20:34,869
These letters say otherwise.

712
01:20:40,107 --> 01:20:43,012
Mary! Mary?

713
01:20:43,745 --> 01:20:46,580
We've quite the surprise
for you.

714
01:20:46,614 --> 01:20:51,020
Just had word today,
and what exciting word it is.

715
01:20:52,753 --> 01:20:55,656
It is a school that is full
of the right sort of people

716
01:20:55,690 --> 01:20:58,093
and the right sort
of discipline.

717
01:20:58,126 --> 01:21:00,395
Now, the car will
take you at 3:30.

718
01:21:00,427 --> 01:21:03,597
We've already packed what
possessions you have into your trunk.

719
01:21:03,631 --> 01:21:05,400
Tomorrow?
Hmm.

720
01:21:05,432 --> 01:21:07,435
I'm not ready.

721
01:21:07,468 --> 01:21:11,073
Uncle? Please, Uncle!
No, you don't!

722
01:21:11,105 --> 01:21:12,840
Why do you say
your son has a hump?

723
01:21:12,873 --> 01:21:15,010
- What are you talking about now?
- Colin.

724
01:21:15,043 --> 01:21:18,413
Stop with your talking.
Or this will get much worse.

725
01:21:18,445 --> 01:21:21,449
He thinks he has a hump,
but he doesn't, and I think you know it.

726
01:21:21,482 --> 01:21:23,351
I'm sorry, sir.

727
01:21:23,385 --> 01:21:26,754
Do you honestly think Grace
would've wanted this life for you?

728
01:21:26,788 --> 01:21:28,790
You know nothing of my wife.

729
01:21:28,823 --> 01:21:33,128
I know she wouldn't just stand outside
his door while he cries at night.

730
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:35,730
Can't you see
what you're doing to him?

731
01:21:39,534 --> 01:21:42,404
Colin needs to live,

732
01:21:42,436 --> 01:21:44,105
and this house
is a prison for you both.

733
01:21:47,675 --> 01:21:50,979
I'm sorry, sir.
She leaves tomorrow.

734
01:21:51,012 --> 01:21:52,414
Good.

735
01:23:41,088 --> 01:23:43,925
I can hide in
the garden and be happy.

736
01:23:43,958 --> 01:23:46,127
At school? I can't.

737
01:23:46,159 --> 01:23:48,562
We don't want you
to go either.

738
01:23:48,596 --> 01:23:51,098
He's right. We don't.

739
01:23:51,132 --> 01:23:55,803
But you can't stay locked up in
the garden forever. Life needs living.

740
01:23:55,837 --> 01:23:58,507
Yeah, says the boy who's seen none of it.

741
01:23:58,539 --> 01:24:01,709
Says the girl so determined no
one loves her, she'll make it so.

742
01:24:01,743 --> 01:24:06,748
They won't like me like you do. I'll go back to being alone.

743
01:24:11,819 --> 01:24:15,022
That smoke...
is that normal?

744
01:24:15,056 --> 01:24:17,926
No.
Father? Father!

745
01:24:18,793 --> 01:24:20,529
Go! Go!

746
01:24:28,735 --> 01:24:30,704
Mary! Get away!

747
01:24:30,738 --> 01:24:31,972
Who's inside?

748
01:24:32,006 --> 01:24:34,042
Mr. Craven.
We don't know where.

749
01:24:34,074 --> 01:24:35,876
I know where he'll be!

750
01:24:35,909 --> 01:24:37,811
The brigade
has been called!

751
01:24:37,845 --> 01:24:39,280
Mary!

752
01:24:39,314 --> 01:24:41,850
No, girl.

753
01:24:43,284 --> 01:24:44,986
No!

754
01:24:45,019 --> 01:24:47,821
Come back, girl!

755
01:24:47,855 --> 01:24:49,156
Mr. Craven!

756
01:24:54,662 --> 01:24:57,231
Colin?

757
01:25:03,704 --> 01:25:06,073
Colin!

758
01:25:07,307 --> 01:25:09,743
Mr. Craven!

759
01:25:10,979 --> 01:25:14,281
Where is my son?
Where are you?

760
01:25:14,315 --> 01:25:15,551
Please...

761
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:19,887
Mr. Craven!

762
01:25:19,921 --> 01:25:22,891
I don't understand.
I knew you'd be here.

763
01:25:22,923 --> 01:25:26,093
- I'm not going.
- I can't go.

764
01:25:26,127 --> 01:25:27,963
Mr. Craven,
you need to come with me.

765
01:25:27,995 --> 01:25:30,131
I will not leave
without my son.

766
01:25:30,163 --> 01:25:33,167
Your son is not here, sir,
but he is safe and well.

767
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:35,369
I can't desert him.

768
01:25:35,403 --> 01:25:37,071
Not again.

769
01:25:37,105 --> 01:25:38,941
I left your son
not five minutes ago.

770
01:25:40,874 --> 01:25:44,312
I give you my word
on the soul of Grace Craven.

771
01:25:59,994 --> 01:26:01,630
Come on!
No.

772
01:26:04,798 --> 01:26:06,068
I can't lift you.

773
01:26:07,935 --> 01:26:09,204
I can't.

774
01:26:09,236 --> 01:26:12,140
Just leave me.
Please.

775
01:26:12,172 --> 01:26:14,208
Don't.
Please, leave me here.

776
01:26:14,242 --> 01:26:17,012
He needs you!
Your son needs you!

777
01:26:19,113 --> 01:26:20,749
I've ruined everything.

778
01:26:55,783 --> 01:26:57,753
Come on! We're going!

779
01:27:13,167 --> 01:27:15,404
Mr. Craven, I need your help.

780
01:27:58,311 --> 01:27:59,780
Mother?

781
01:28:04,418 --> 01:28:05,887
Mother.

782
01:28:20,133 --> 01:28:21,736
Please stay.

783
01:28:23,337 --> 01:28:26,040
I know you can't,
but please stay.

784
01:28:42,155 --> 01:28:43,891
Mary!

785
01:28:46,427 --> 01:28:48,463
Mary. Are you all right?

786
01:28:48,495 --> 01:28:51,966
Him. Take him first.

787
01:29:39,379 --> 01:29:41,248
Show me...

788
01:29:43,383 --> 01:29:45,419
Show me my son!

789
01:30:04,238 --> 01:30:06,173
It's beautiful.

790
01:30:06,207 --> 01:30:07,941
And it's ours.

791
01:30:07,975 --> 01:30:11,445
It was hers, but now I think
she'd want us to share in it.

792
01:30:13,146 --> 01:30:14,448
And he's here?

793
01:30:17,051 --> 01:30:18,386
Where is my son?

794
01:30:18,953 --> 01:30:21,055
Call for him, sir.

795
01:30:21,087 --> 01:30:22,389
Colin?

796
01:30:25,559 --> 01:30:26,628
Colin!

797
01:30:28,095 --> 01:30:29,297
Father?

798
01:30:32,967 --> 01:30:34,569
Colin.

799
01:30:34,601 --> 01:30:36,238
Father, I'm here!

800
01:30:41,409 --> 01:30:42,644
Colin?

801
01:30:42,677 --> 01:30:44,112
Father?

802
01:30:57,557 --> 01:30:59,194
I thought I'd lost you.

803
01:31:05,298 --> 01:31:06,600
Of all the places.

804
01:31:14,408 --> 01:31:16,144
No. Wait.

805
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:20,515
Please.

806
01:31:29,422 --> 01:31:30,992
One, two...

807
01:31:54,181 --> 01:31:56,117
But how is this...

808
01:32:00,020 --> 01:32:01,388
Magic.

809
01:32:04,324 --> 01:32:05,659
Secrets.

810
01:32:08,061 --> 01:32:09,430
Her.

811
01:32:12,632 --> 01:32:14,434
Her?

812
01:32:14,467 --> 01:32:15,502
His mother.

813
01:32:23,543 --> 01:32:25,680
How is it that we're
taught by our children?

814
01:32:27,714 --> 01:32:29,217
How is that?

815
01:32:32,653 --> 01:32:34,222
I'm sorry.

816
01:32:37,190 --> 01:32:38,559
I'm so sorry.

817
01:32:38,592 --> 01:32:39,728
Enough of that.

818
01:32:40,794 --> 01:32:43,664
Now, tell me...

819
01:32:45,298 --> 01:32:47,002
Do you like our garden?

820
01:33:21,502 --> 01:33:26,339
We have the large French
windows overlooking the patio...

821
01:33:26,373 --> 01:33:28,709
<i>There were once three people
who loved each other very much.</i>

822
01:33:28,742 --> 01:33:30,711
<i>Four.
Are you including Hector?</i>

823
01:33:30,744 --> 01:33:33,114
<i>Maybe I was including
Hector and not including you.</i>

824
01:33:33,146 --> 01:33:35,283
<i>Five.
I want to include my father.</i>

825
01:33:35,315 --> 01:33:37,818
- <i>Martha needs to be included.</i>
- <i>Six. And Martha.</i>

826
01:33:37,851 --> 01:33:41,788
<i>There were once some people
who lived in an old, deserted house.</i>

827
01:33:41,821 --> 01:33:43,423
<i>Partially deserted.</i>

828
01:33:43,457 --> 01:33:45,126
<i>And they
discovered a garden.</i>

829
01:33:45,159 --> 01:33:46,461
<i>One of the people
discovered a garden</i>

830
01:33:46,494 --> 01:33:48,496
<i>and they didn't know it
at first</i>

831
01:33:48,529 --> 01:33:50,765
- <i>but the garden was a magic garden.</i>
- <i>It was.</i>

832
01:33:50,797 --> 01:33:52,699
<i>Because it was a magic
garden it was going to save them</i>

833
01:33:52,732 --> 01:33:54,601
<i>as much as they
were going to save it.</i>

834
01:33:54,635 --> 01:33:56,236
<i>I think you should
talk more about Hector.</i>

835
01:33:56,270 --> 01:33:57,638
<i>If you don't
both pipe down,</i>

836
01:33:57,671 --> 01:33:59,373
<i>I shan't tell
the story at all!</i>

837
01:33:59,405 --> 01:34:00,874
- <i>Sorry, Mary.</i>
- <i>Sorry, Mary.</i>

838
01:34:00,908 --> 01:34:02,477
<i>Thank you.</i>

839
01:34:02,510 --> 01:34:04,678
<i>Now if you're ready
and silent,</i>

840
01:34:04,712 --> 01:34:06,513
<i>I shall try again...</i>

841
01:34:25,865 --> 01:34:27,267
Ohh!

842
01:34:37,246 --> 01:34:42,246
