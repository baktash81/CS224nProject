He honestly doesn't seem to like you, Finstock.

23
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,750
He loves me. Do you know why?

24
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,311
He loves me, because I'm his master.

25
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,755
He knows I will protect him.

26
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,514
Like the students here
at Hamilton University. Sit!

27
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,875
They know why I'm here.

28
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,315
Finstock, do you know why you're here?

29
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,040
Yes, sir. 32.500 a year and summers off.

30
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,108
You're here because it's time to bring
the glory back to this institution.

31
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,840
The regional boxing finals
are in three months.

32
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,073
Now, you and I have a sacred oath

33
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,959
to provide these young people
with an opportunity

34
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,352
To develop not only their minds,
but their spirit as well.

35
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,513
Their fighting spirit. Am I right?

36
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,719
I promised the alumni
a winning boxing team

37
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,553
and all you've given me is this Todd Howard.

38
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,679
All he ever did on the field
was play in the school band.

39
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,398
Clarinet, looks like.

40
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,391
Can I make a sudden move?

41
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,950
That's the kid. His cousin Scott played
basketball for me at Beacontown High.

42
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,519
- And?
- And what?

43
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,830
"And what? And what?" What?!

44
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,233
I don't think Scott knew the first thing
about playing the clarinet.

45
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,836
I gave that kid a full scholarship
based on your recommendation.

46
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,389
On my recommendation? That's great.

47
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,518
- Finstock!
- What?

48
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,513
Your job is riding on this boxing team.

49
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,148
And so is my reputation as an educator.

50
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,636
And all you brought me is a clarinet player?

51
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,633
- <i>(girl)</i> I think it's that way.
- OK. Three blocks?

52
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,439
<i>(horn honking)</i>
<i>(man)</i> Todd! Todd!

53
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,397
- Thanks a lot.
- Bye.

54
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,313
- <i>(man)</i> Come on, Todd. Let's go.
- <i>(girl)</i> Excuse me.

55
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,750
She said the dorm was past the quad
and left after the administration building.

56
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,435
- <i>(Todd)</i> Or was it right?
- We'll just keep going straight.

57
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,115
I know how you feel.

58
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,670
College is a stressful time.
Especially on your first day.

59
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,870
I mean, it's stressful for anyone.

60
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,715
Even for people without your particular worry.

61
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,833
- What worry?
- You know.

62
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,675
<i>(girl)</i> I don't believe it.

63
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,678
<i>(girl)</i> Wow!

64
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,035
<i>(woman)</i> Absolutely, I mean...

65
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,191
I hate it when you do that.

66
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,148
I'm not ashamed of what I am
and you shouldn't be either.

67
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,517
I'm not, because it skipped my family.

68
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,238
<i>(clears throat)</i>

69
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,154
No, I've got enough problems.
I'm here at a new school.

70
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:07,872
I gotta make new friends and try
to fit in without this hanging over me.

71
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,677
It is true that sometimes it skips family members.

72
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,832
Your mother and father aren't werewolves.

73
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,676
But if I were you,
I'd keep my possibilities open.

74
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:34,589
Uncle Harold, can you please
change back before we get to the dorm?

75
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,149
Thanks.

76
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,759
I think the dorm is a little north from here.

77
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,195
Watch out!

78
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,110
<i>(Harold)</i> Phew!

79
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,350
<i>(disco music playing in car)</i>

80
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,517
Excuse me, I think that this was our space.

81
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,756
- Are you talking to me?
- No, but...

82
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,196
...I'd like to maybe give you a call.

83
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,876
- Gus, he says this is his space.
- A freshman.

84
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,109
Did you think I said that this was my space?
I didn't say that. No.

85
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,829
This is your space.
My space has yellow lines on it.

86
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,357
I brought my uncle by to see your space,
because it's so nice.

87
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:35,230
And now since you're in your space,
we'll get in ours.

88
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,358
- They seem like nice kids.
- I saw another space up the street.

<i>(indistinct conversation)</i>

90
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,353
Todd? Buddy, how are you? Come on in.

91
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,717
Drop your stuff off. Make yourself at home.

92
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:12,716
- Do I... know you?
- Stiles. We're roommates.

93
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,270
- <i>(Harold)</i> Stiles?
- Mr. H?

94
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,830
- Stiles!
- Mr. H! How's the prince of paint?

95
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,630
- What are you doing here?
- Connections. Daughter of somebody.

96
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,870
Let me just tidy up a bit.

97
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,228
It's a great room, huh?
I decorated it myself.

98
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:37,393
Well, what do you think?
You're in the big time, kid. College.

99
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:42,588
No one telling you what to do.
No more picking up your stuff. No parents.

100
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,877
No offence, Mr. H. Let me help you with that.

101
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,672
- Todd?
- Yeah?

102
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,513
- Will you walk me to the van?
- Sure.

103
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,797
Everything is kosher.
I've taken care of everything.

104
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,316
I've got Todd's year at college all mapped out.

105
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,037
For the drive home.

106
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,273
<i>(Harold)</i> Todd?

107
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,876
<i>(guy)</i> Thanks. You got any fries?

108
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,476
- See you in a bit.
- We are gonna have a great year.

109
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,757
- I think so.
- I've got them vibes happening.

110
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,512
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

111
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,715
In a big way.

112
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,039
- Hey.
- Todd, I...

113
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,476
Listen, Uncle Harold,
everything's gonna be fine.

114
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,916
Once I start those science classes,
I'll really like it here.

115
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,230
But what about that sports scholarship?

116
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,951
The closest you ever came to an athletic field
was playing clarinet in the marching band.

117
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,669
Once they take a look at me,
they won't want me on any team.

118
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,831
They ain't gonna give you
something for nothing.

119
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,798
Well, I guess that's their problem.

120
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,436
- Don't forget your groceries.
- Oh yeah, thanks.

121
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:03,433
I promised your mum and dad
to look after you.

122
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,512
I didn't expect
to find Stiles as your roommate.

123
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,274
He seems OK.

124
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,753
Stiles was Scott's best friend
in high school. He knows all about us.

125
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,559
Well, I figure since I'm not a...

126
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:24,550
Since I don't have the family problem,
there's nothing to worry about.

127
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,950
I'm sure you'll be OK. Hey, listen...

128
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,715
- What are you doing?
- Take this. You never know.

129
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,549
- <i>(Todd)</i> Well, take care.
- Yeah.

130
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,154
What?

131
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,313
- If you need anything, you call me.
- I will.

132
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,678
- OK.
- Thanks, Uncle Harold. Take it easy.

133
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,398
Call me.

134
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,353

No mercy!

Ha, ha, ha!

Chocolate milk.

<i>(guy)</i> Grab the door for me?

144
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,959
- Todd, Chubby. Chub, Todd.
- Hi.

145
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,634
Chub played basketball
at Beacontown, Todd.

146
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,030
- So you know my cousin?
- Scott.

147
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,512
- We just love the Howard family.
- Stiles, where is all my stuff?

148
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:03,036
Some of my T-shirts are in there,
but help yourself. I don't mind.

149
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:09,070
What did you mean when you said
you've taken care of everything?

150
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,834
All your classes. I registered for you.

151
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,919
You what? I've already pre-registered.

152
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,710
I know. I saw what you picked.
I made the necessary changes. Trust me.

153
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,676
- This is all wrong. Girls' volleyball?
- Good class.

154
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,195
Candle making? French for chefs?

155
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,830
<i>C'est très magnifique. </i>
It's a good class. I'm taking it again.

156
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,710
- There's not one science class on here.
- Science?

157
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,871
You don't understand.

158
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,358
That boy's got werewolf written all over him.

159
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,798
If everything goes as planned,
he and I are gonna take the school by storm.

160
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,475
I love college. I love it.

161
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,391
- <i>(boy)</i> I gotta get these changed.
- <i>(woman)</i> Don't make me laugh, kid.

162
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,279
<i>(woman)</i> Rules are rules. Policy is policy.

163
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:10,194
- This has got to be changed.
- <i>(woman)</i> You've got a lot of nerve.

164
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,238
Nobody ever changes their classes.

Come on, I haven't got all day.

169
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:47,270
<i>(growling)</i> (<i>in a deep voice</i>)
I'd like... to change... some classes.

170
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:04,470
Have your professor sign this
and bring it back here. But not to me.

171
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,950
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

172
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,709
It's not as tough as it looks.

173
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:26,430
- I'm looking for Professor Brooks.
- She's not in there.

174
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,638
<i>(laughs)</i>

175
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,429
I was wondering if you could tell me
where she might be?

176
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,309
Professor Brooks is
both omnivorous and bipedal.

177
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,712
<i>(sound of high-heeled shoes)</i>
She's also a <i>homo sapiens femininus. </i>

178
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,713
And a brilliant one at that.

179
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,718
- I'm Tanya Brooks. Can I help you?
- Yeah, I'm Todd... Howard.

180
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,590
- Howard, yes. I know all about you.
- You do?

181
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,558
I'm your faculty advisor.
I read your application.

182
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,154
Your talent for science
is very impressive.

183
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,710
I was surprised that you're here
on an athletic scholarship.

184
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:22,159
Surprised me too.
I have a favor to ask you.

185
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,993
I wanna be a veterinarian
and I need your class.

186
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:29,312
I know registration is over,
but could you see it my way?

187
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,075
- Yes?
- You're in my class. It's not full yet.

188
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,869
- As your advisor, I'll make an exception.
- Really? Thank you.

189
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,429
Thank you very much.

190
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:53,117
- What are you looking at?
- I'm looking for <i>lubrus protozoa. </i>.

191
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,838
Let's see.

192
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,113
Here it is, right here.

193
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,149
There's nothing on this.

194
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,118
It sort of helps if you turn it on.

195
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,752
See you.

196
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,593
- I need to speak to a coach.
- You're Todd Howard.

197
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,672
- Yeah.
- We're all depending on you.

198
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:48,550
- Depending on me for what?
- Hey, you missed a spot.

199
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,748
I had a kid once who had
an athletic scholarship just like you.

200
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,229
A gifted athlete.

201
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,518
But he had this crazy dream
about wanting to become a chiropractor.

202
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,990
But he had to work all night at this diner.

203
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,676
Because he was supporting his sister
and she had three kids.

204
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:13,709
- And his name was Philip. No wait.
- Doesn't matter.

205
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,633
It sorta does. His name was George.

206
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,519
Her three kids were really nice,

207
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,672
but one had two thumbs on his right hand.

208
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,678
So did he become a chiropractor?

209
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,752
Not with two thumbs
on his right hand, he didn't.

210
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,357
Wait a minute.
You're from Beacontown, aren't you?

211
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,431
Yeah.

212
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,195
Now I get it. You think that I'm...

213
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,640
You can forget it. I'm not Scott.
I can't do what Scott did.

214
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,314
What's a five-letter word
for "Italian sausage"?

215
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,472
So that's why they gave me
a sports scholarship.

216
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,714
So what? Go a few rounds in the ring,
get your head knocked off. Maybe.

217
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,155
You get your scholarship
and everybody's happy.

218
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,438
- Jump into what ring?
- Just show up for practice this Thursday.

219
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,955
- Practice for what?
- Boxing.

220
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,949
"Frank". That's perfect.

221
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,874
Would you take it easy?

222
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,558
I wanna keep this scholarship
and I don't know what I'm doing.

223
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,154
Fat kid's a great dancer.

224
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,594
<i>(Todd)</i> All right.

225
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,155
OK, you wanna play rough?

226
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,788
I'll throw two jabs. Come back with a right.

227
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,193
- Which one's the Howard kid?
- <i>(Finstock)</i> Hey, Todd.

228
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,108
I guess he's a little rusty.

229
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:31,715
If this is some kind of joke,
you'll notice I'm not laughing.

230
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,232
<i>(xylophone music)</i>

231
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,476
<i>(coughing)</i>

232
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,797
- I had dibs on this.
- Possession is nine tenths of the law.

233
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,599
So now you're a lawyer?
Thought you were a biologist.

234
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,356
What do you want with it anyway?
It's probably over your head.

235
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,229
- Over my head?
- Over any jock's head.

236
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,879
Jock?

237
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:25,993
Listen, I just wanna go to this school,
but I'm here on a sports scholarship

238
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,993
with a coach who wants me
to have two right thumbs.

239
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,472
My roommate sunbathes with a light bulb,
some fat kid eats all my food.

240
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,598
I've got Dean Dunn's dog
trying to bite my leg off.

241
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,638
- And you want the only book that I want?
- Shh!

242
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:46,832
Well, I'll tell you what. You can have
this book and this book and this book.

243
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,877
- And keep that book as well.
- Shh!

244
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,393
<i>(Todd)</i> You too, buddy.

- Here. You want this more than I do.
- Thanks.

248
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,317
I... I guess I got a little carried away in there.

249
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,557
I guess you did.

Little light reading for you, huh?

253
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,916
I should have known
that I'd find you in the science section.

254

I probably won't be needing
this book anyway.

- Would you like to...
- I'd love to.

- Sure.

Do lab partners work on the weekends
this early in the semester?

Oh...

00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:50,112
- I thought you were asking me if...
- Really? Oh...

00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:55,991
Well, then you mean you'd like to?
I mean, maybe...

Mrs. St. Claire, one of our benefactors.

- Pleasure to meet you.
- Thank you.

I'd like you also to meet
Lisa Goldfluss and Emily Lord.

Miss Goldfluss, do you
have an explanation for this?

00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:39,149
- What are you so upset about?
- Upset, Stiles? Me, upset?

302
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,709
I had a beard all over my body.

303
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,555
Fingernails the size of French fries.
Teeth from here to Texas.

304
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,359
And she called me a dog. A dog!

305
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,637
OK, I might be able to cut you a deal.

306
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,873
If they let you keep the scholarship,
you become the school mascot.

307
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,077
- Yeah?
- This is just the tip of the iceberg.

308
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,231
Everybody will be talking about you.

309
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,915
All you gotta do is be the wolf, Todd.
I'll do the rest.

310
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:10,438
Wonderful. Wonderful.
She called me a dog.

311
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,273
<i>(man)</i> The bed they laid him in
was only six feet long.

312
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:21,673
His feet hung over the end.

313
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,630
Mary, his wife, clung to his side.

314
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:31,271
Her tears mingled with his blood.

315
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,389
Her prayers echoed the grief
of an entire nation.

316
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:42,032
The small projectile from the derringer
that John Wilkes Booth used

317
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,670
- was lodged in his left temple.
- I've got fleas. You distract him.

318
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:52,393
And all night long the vigil waited
in that small boarding house

319
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:57,076
across from Ford's Theatre
until the wee hours in the morning.

320
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:03,231
When fate dealt that final blow...

321
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,997
...a crowd of mourners gathered,

322
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:13,951
white, black, rich and poor.

323
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:20,389
And so, ten hours after that fatal shot,
President Abraham Lincoln...

324
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:24,189
Mr. Howard, where are you going? Mr. Howard.

325
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,191
Ah! Ah! Ah!

326
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,073

327
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,756
Todd Howard. I've been wanting
to speak with you, young man.

328
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,435
Your disruptive behavior
at yesterday's reception

329
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,478
warrants my personal attention,
don't you think?

330
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,192
I don't like practical jokes.
I am not a funny man.

331
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:50,273
I fail to see the humor
of dressing up in a dog costume

332

Your first fight is coming up.
So far I'm unimpressed.

You'd better not fail me, because if you do,

00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:20,479
I'll call every dean at every school

339
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,189

That's all for today. Thank you.

I've got a ton of stuff here.

<i>(Stiles)</i> Chubby.

505
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,678
Chubby? Chub?

506
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,156
<i>(farting sound)</i>

507
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,110
Chubby?

508
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:33,995
- <i>(sniffs)</i> Chubby.
- What?

509
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:38,234
I've created a monster.

510
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:41,558
<i>(Chubby)</i> Mmm...

511
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,471
<i>(Chubby)</i> Hmm?

512
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:52,710
<i>(girl)</i> That smell is disgusting.

513
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:08,116
OK, so I was absent
the day you guys did this.

514
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,398
- Are you mad at me?
- Ha!

515
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,630
- You're jealous.
- What?

516
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:21,715
Of those two leeches you hang around with?
You can't even see it, can you?

517
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:23,916
They don't like you, only the wolf.

518
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:28,119
Look, just because everything
is going great for me

519
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:31,192
doesn't give you the right
to go off and start...

520
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,275
- You just hit me with a dead frog.
- Jerk.

521
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:40,919
Jerk?

522
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:51,999
Frog fight!

523
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:59,196
<i>(croaking)</i>

524
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:03,075
<i>(Todd)</i> Incoming!

525
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:12,913
<i>(croaking)</i>

526
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,312
<i>(Professor Brooks)</i> What is going on here?
Frog fighting in my lab?

527
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:21,630
Put those things away.

528
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:25,280
That's the end of class for today.

529
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:28,356
Except for you.

530
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,556
I wanna talk to you.

531
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:38,710
<i>(croaking in background)</i>

532
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:52,669
I've been talking with your other professors.

533
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:57,436
I know about the car, your grades
and how you're coasting through.

534
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:03,516
When you have a gift,
you have a responsibility to use it wisely.

535
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:07,514
You're not. And you're
only letting yourself down.

536
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:13,992
- Are you in a hurry?
- Actually, I have to get to practice.

537
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,639
Team's nothing without the wolf.

538
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:19,509
You can't expect the wolf
to solve all your problems.

539
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:22,638
You do realize
you have finals coming up, don't you?

540
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:27,271
- Yeah, regional finals?
- No, course finals.

541
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:35,315
Listen, I don't think I need this class.

542
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:37,948
You told me to choose the right path.

543
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:41,476
And with the road that I've chosen...

544
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:43,870
...I don't think I need biology at all.

545
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,549
I'm very sorry to hear that.

546
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,230
You waited for me?

547
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:08,076
I don't know why.

548
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:13,229
I never thought I'd say it,

549
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,516
but I miss the old Todd.

550
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,752
What happened?

551
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:23,157
- He turned into a werewolf.
- But that's not the real you.

552
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:27,677
The wolf lets me do what I wanna do. It's a gift.

553
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:30,559
- I have a responsibility to myself...
- Responsibility?

554
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:35,589
What about school? Or being a veterinarian?
What about you and me?

555
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:42,593
My feelings for you are real.
They have nothing to do with the wolf.

556
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:45,797
Those others could care less about the real you.

557
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:48,713
Look, I'm late and you're wrong.

558
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,988
That's the way it's done, girls.

559
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:06,715
<i>(children laughing in background)</i>

560
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,799
Watch this.

561
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:24,509
We'll play through.

562
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:31,795
How can you take him seriously?
He's a freshman.

563
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,156
With an awful lot of hair.

564
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:42,313
Why don't you shut your mouth?

565
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:45,631
- (<i>Todd</i>) Let's settle this man to man.
- I don't fight chipmunks.

566
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,836
Not here, Gus.

567
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,550
What are you doing?

568
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,677
Where are you going?

569
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:12,558
You die in the ring, pal.

570
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,992
Fore!

571
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,432
It's in the hole.

572
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,796
You guys studying?

573
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:51,478
Yes, some of us
actually have to take finals.

574
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:57,916
Mr. Stilinsky...

575
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,913
...what say you, me and the wolf

576
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:05,389
take the wheels for a little...

577
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:07,949
<i>(imitates car sounds)</i>

578
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:09,553
...spin?

579
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:12,029
- Nope.
- <i>(Todd)</i> Huh, huh?

580
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:21,955
How about you, big guy?
I might even let you drive.

581
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:23,997
What do you say?

582
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:27,588
I'm busy. OK?

583
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:32,358
- See you, Stiles.
- See you, Chub.

584
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:41,557
- Check 46.
- You know what's funny?

585
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:44,951
I wanted you to become the wolf
more than anybody else.

586
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:48,556
So I guess I'm partly to blame
for what you've become.

587
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:53,558
What have I become?

588
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:55,995
- A jerk, Todd.
- Aw...

589
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:06,037
<i>(sighs)</i>

590
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:45,914
Thank you for coming. I...

591
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:48,514
I really need to talk to you.

592
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:51,990
- You're in a tough spot, huh?
- Yeah.

593
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,635
I just let it get out of hand.

594
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:05,388
I mean, I know you... you warned me.

595
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:11,638
And I guess I should've listened, because...

596
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:17,599
...I got a little crazy, Uncle Harold,
and I ended up hurting

597
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:21,469
a lot of people that I really care about.

598
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:23,756
What are you gonna do about it?

599
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:27,871
I don't know.

600
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,035
I really don't know.

601
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:35,078
Well, don't be too tough on yourself.

602
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:39,199
After all, you're only human too.

603
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:42,151
So?

604
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:46,393
So you made a mistake.
You admitted it. It's over.

605
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:50,599
Maybe it's time you were Todd Howard again.

606
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:52,751
I'm scared.

607
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:56,752
Really scared.

608
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:03,438
If I'm myself in this ring tomorrow,
I could get killed.

609
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:05,955
I don't think you're gonna get killed.

610
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:11,238
This guy's really big. He's huge.

611
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,356
Never mind him.

612
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:18,196
'Cause what I'm interested in is you
and what you've got right there.

613
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:23,835
What does that matter
when the guy is twice your size?

614
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,232
- Well...
- I wouldn't stand a chance.

615
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,550
Maybe not.

616
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:38,635
But sometimes you have to make
a stand. Even if you don't want to.

617
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:42,031
- What's that?
- Boxing gloves. They used to belong to me.

618
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:47,149
- In college I used to box, too.
- Really?

619
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:51,791
Yeah, I can show you some moves
nobody's seen in 30 years.

620
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:54,110
- Now when's this big match?
- Tomorrow.

621
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:55,759
Plenty of time.

622
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:27,594
- What are you doing?
- Studying.

623
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:33,909
I still have two more finals.
I guess you wouldn't know about that.

624
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:43,110
Nicki...

625
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:45,271
...I'm real sorry.

626
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:48,038
For everything.

627
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:53,479
- I guess the wolf makes you a jerk.
- No, I'm a jerk.

628
01:03:55,720 --> 01:04:00,794
I just hope that there's still time
to make up for it all.

629
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:14,153
- There's still time to try.
- I wanna try.

630
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:17,517
You can start by saying you're really sorry

631
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:20,558
for mistreating someone you like.

632
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:24,235
I'm sorry for mistreating someone...

633
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:26,595
...I really love.

634
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:40,357
- You missed your final.
- What?

635
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:44,479
Your final.
I'm sure Professor Brooks flunked you.

636
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:46,835
Oh? Yeah.

637
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:51,471
- Maybe we could talk to her.
- Yeah.

638
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:59,910
- Professor Brooks? Hi.
- Hi.

639
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:03,231
We were just coming to see you.

640
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:06,756
Listen, I know
I probably don't deserve it, but...

641
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:11,596
...if you would give me a second chance,
I'd really like to earn my grade.

642
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:16,038
You can take a make up exam
tomorrow at noon at the latest.

643
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:20,113
I have to turn the grades in
by the end of the day.

644
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:25,798
- I have a fight at three.
- The test takes three hours.

645
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:29,396
- Take it or leave it.
- <i>(Nicki)</i> We'll take it.

646
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:31,630
<i>(Todd)</i> Yeah, thank you very much.

647
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:11,439

648
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:24,198
- Good luck on your test.
- Thanks.

649
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:26,237
And at the match.

650
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:32,476
- Will you come see me box?
- Yeah.

651
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:48,949
- Good luck.
- Bye.

652
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:39,557
Well, that's the best I could do.

653
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:41,995
I missed a few classes.

654
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:51,878
It looks like you did well enough
to pass the course.

655
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:53,553
Great.

656
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:57,710
Professor Brooks,

657
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:02,317
I really wanna thank you for trying to help

658
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:05,233
when things got a little crazy.

659
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:08,077
Welcome back.

- Taking a final.

01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:36,319
Where's the wolf?

663
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:40,234
You got to go fight in the 145 pound class now.

664
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:44,074
That's Peter's weight class.

665
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:49,268
- Yeah, so what?
- Look coach, we are a team.

666
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:55,714
We're gonna fight as a team.
And I am going up against Gus.

667
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,598
That's great.

668
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:03,675
All of you go and get your brains
knocked out. That'll be attractive.

I'll take care of the rest.
Grades, cars, money, women.

It'll be our little secret.
