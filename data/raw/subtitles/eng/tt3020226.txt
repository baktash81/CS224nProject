1
00:02:03,258 --> 00:02:04,164
Yeah!

2
00:02:25,094 --> 00:02:27,547
- Hey, Dani.
- Hey.

3
00:02:27,906 --> 00:02:30,845
Sweetheart, you took
the competition by storm.

4
00:02:30,929 --> 00:02:33,723
- Oh, thanks dad.
- Mm, so proud of you.

5
00:02:34,182 --> 00:02:36,079
When the rest of
the competition is here too?

6
00:02:36,153 --> 00:02:38,061
Well now, don't get too confident.

7
00:02:38,144 --> 00:02:40,723
Dad, it's called being the best,
not being over-confident.

8
00:02:40,772 --> 00:02:44,428
- I want a horse too.
- Oh! No.

9
00:02:45,562 --> 00:02:48,589
Um... You know it's nearly four.

10
00:02:49,572 --> 00:02:53,085
I know what time it is.
Excuse me.

11
00:02:53,585 --> 00:02:54,832
Yeah?

12
00:02:55,957 --> 00:02:58,900
No, I told you
that account's in the Caymans.

13
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:02,810
Daddy!

14
00:03:03,697 --> 00:03:04,924
Yes.

15
00:03:11,887 --> 00:03:13,190
What's Dad mad at?

16
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:16,177
Well, I don't know.
Probably something work related.

17
00:03:16,543 --> 00:03:18,330
He and mom has been fighting.

18
00:03:18,686 --> 00:03:20,479
They kind of fight all the time.

19
00:03:20,713 --> 00:03:21,940
Will figure that out.

20
00:03:22,179 --> 00:03:23,966
Didn't with your mom.

21
00:03:29,713 --> 00:03:30,907
Hi!

22
00:03:34,576 --> 00:03:36,556
Hey, Brooke.
Want some popcorn?

23
00:03:36,796 --> 00:03:38,363
No, thanks, Jordan.

24
00:03:38,778 --> 00:03:40,551
You know, my answer hasn't changed.

25
00:03:40,765 --> 00:03:43,012
But you know we'll pay you a price.

26
00:03:43,168 --> 00:03:45,183
I'm not selling Admiral.

27
00:03:48,184 --> 00:03:50,831
You can probably find a better horse.

28
00:03:53,337 --> 00:03:54,557
Maybe you're right.

29
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:57,665
Yeah. Maybe it'll sprout wings too.

30
00:04:11,114 --> 00:04:13,595
George, George listen to me.

31
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:16,929
Ok that's why you're
in a six-figure retainer.

32
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:19,612
No, I-I don't care.

33
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:21,646
 No! Just-just...

34
00:04:22,146 --> 00:04:24,632
get me a continuance.

35
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:30,800
No. Are you telling me that
you can't just buy me a couple of days?

36
00:04:32,989 --> 00:04:35,082
Then, I need a new lawyer.

37
00:04:35,387 --> 00:04:38,099
No, you figure it out!

38
00:04:44,815 --> 00:04:46,818
Hey, here you go.

39
00:04:49,529 --> 00:04:52,274
Maybe you should ask for the horse.
For your birthday.

40
00:04:52,406 --> 00:04:53,707
You think I'm good enough?

41
00:04:53,834 --> 00:04:55,654
Well, you're my little brother, aren't you?

42
00:04:55,758 --> 00:04:57,307
Half brother.

43
00:04:58,996 --> 00:05:00,772
Got this in town for you.

44
00:05:01,012 --> 00:05:02,672
Yeah. What is it?

45
00:05:02,812 --> 00:05:03,919
Cookies.

46
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:07,886
- Chocolate chip.
- Oh, my favorite.

47
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,024
Hey...

48
00:05:11,503 --> 00:05:13,230
we're not half anything.

49
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:15,184
You're my little brother...

50
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,820
and we're family.
Got it?

51
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:19,693
- Okay.
- Okay.

52
00:05:19,799 --> 00:05:22,109
I'm gonna go tell
Mom about the horse.

53
00:05:23,104 --> 00:05:25,982
You'd better hurry!
And eat your sandwich!

54
00:05:26,122 --> 00:05:29,585
Hey Mom, I know what I want for my...
Where are you going?

55
00:05:29,652 --> 00:05:32,238
Where are we going?
We're leaving.

56
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,617
I packed your suitcase.
It's upstairs in your room.

57
00:05:34,657 --> 00:05:36,417
Go get it and bring it downstairs.

58
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:37,390
What?

59
00:05:37,497 --> 00:05:38,960
Go get it right now.

60
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,920
We're leaving...
and we're not coming back.

61
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,195
There you are.

62
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:53,956
We're going.

63
00:05:54,217 --> 00:05:57,229
You're not going anywhere.
You're on the board.

64
00:05:57,596 --> 00:05:58,720
Not anymore.

65
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:04,543
I had my lawyer divest me of any and
all holdings and positions in the company.

66
00:06:05,188 --> 00:06:08,224
- When did you do...?
- I am not going down with you, Mitch!

67
00:06:08,384 --> 00:06:11,638
Now, I know you have
money stashed offshore...

68
00:06:11,858 --> 00:06:13,198
and I want my share.

69
00:06:13,311 --> 00:06:17,267
Even if I did stash money
overseas, you wouldn't see a dime.

70
00:06:17,501 --> 00:06:19,027
Jordan will.

71
00:06:19,534 --> 00:06:21,554
What are you doing for money now?

72
00:06:21,747 --> 00:06:25,523
I sold my stocks and bonds
and I closed the house account.

73
00:06:25,663 --> 00:06:29,212
- And I sold some jewelry too.
- And that's gonna last you a week.

74
00:06:29,296 --> 00:06:31,633
Yah, at least I have a week.

75
00:06:39,515 --> 00:06:41,199
Where are they going?

76
00:06:41,927 --> 00:06:43,427
Who cares?

77
00:06:54,938 --> 00:06:56,998
Oh! Careful!

78
00:06:57,098 --> 00:06:58,494
What you got in here?
Rocks?

79
00:06:58,611 --> 00:07:00,870
You mean like the
ones in your head.  Go.

80
00:07:01,008 --> 00:07:04,248
- How come I have to go with you?
- Don't argue.

81
00:07:04,933 --> 00:07:07,957
- Where are you guys going?
- Away.

82
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,997
Wait, but I forgot my hat.

83
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,657
Well then it must not
have been very important.

84
00:07:17,067 --> 00:07:18,467
Go.

85
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,114
You don't seem understand,
we're in a hurry.

86
00:07:23,475 --> 00:07:24,938
But I forgot my hat!

87
00:07:25,018 --> 00:07:27,512
Oh, we'll get you another one.
Just go.

88
00:07:27,734 --> 00:07:32,360
TYou know, the captain goes down
with the ship but the crew saves itself.

89
00:07:34,674 --> 00:07:37,282
Jordan!
Jordan!

90
00:07:38,367 --> 00:07:40,194
Jordan, wait!

91
00:07:41,108 --> 00:07:43,341
Wait, I got your hat!

92
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:07,982
So, how much will you lose?

93
00:08:11,566 --> 00:08:12,869
Everything...

94
00:08:15,096 --> 00:08:16,803
including Admiral.

95
00:08:17,776 --> 00:08:18,843
What?

96
00:08:20,014 --> 00:08:22,066
Is there something you could do?

97
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:26,740
I can't even make change
for a parking meter right now.

98
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,554
They froze all my assets.

99
00:08:31,688 --> 00:08:32,395
W...

100
00:08:32,508 --> 00:08:34,811
I-I could buy Admiral from you.

101
00:08:35,717 --> 00:08:37,118
With what?

102
00:08:38,044 --> 00:08:40,180
I-I-I have money saved up.

103
00:08:40,301 --> 00:08:43,454
And I...
And I could pay you...

104
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:49,231
Admiral's 200 thousand dollars.

105
00:08:50,444 --> 00:08:53,335
They're going to seize him
along with everything else.

106
00:08:57,446 --> 00:08:58,985
I'm so sorry.

107
00:09:00,292 --> 00:09:03,492
W-What's going to happen to you?

108
00:09:07,164 --> 00:09:09,472
I only know what's
going to happen to you.

109
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,259
Me?

110
00:09:12,854 --> 00:09:15,085
I've made arrangements with Sam.

111
00:09:16,065 --> 00:09:17,778
You're gonna stay with him.

112
00:09:18,343 --> 00:09:19,627
Uncle Sam?

113
00:09:19,827 --> 00:09:22,890
- No! Dad, I can take care of ...
- Sweetheart, sweetheart, you're minor.

114
00:09:23,043 --> 00:09:25,257
Okay you stay with Sam, or
they're gonna put you through

115
00:09:25,283 --> 00:09:28,290
a court appointed foster care system
and I'm not going to let that happen.

116
00:10:03,221 --> 00:10:05,264
I know how hard this must be.

117
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:09,031
He'll have a good home.
I promise.

118
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,730
We're not half-anything.

119
00:10:34,947 --> 00:10:39,044
I've made arrangements with Sam.
You are going to stay with him.

120
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:41,841
I'm so sorry.

121
00:10:45,765 --> 00:10:47,828
- So how's the gelding?
- Good

122
00:10:47,995 --> 00:10:49,955
I still owe you for him, right?

123
00:10:50,075 --> 00:10:51,341
Well, it's okay.

124
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:54,781
Well, I'll pay.
I'm not poor, you know?

125
00:10:54,835 --> 00:10:55,698
I know that.

126
00:10:55,812 --> 00:10:57,425
I told you not to worry about it.

127
00:10:57,618 --> 00:10:59,565
Gotta go.
I got a guest to pick up.

128
00:10:59,778 --> 00:11:00,912
Guest?

129
00:11:01,698 --> 00:11:03,325
You have a guest?

130
00:11:03,687 --> 00:11:06,613
Hey, don't say it like that.
I-I could have a guest.

131
00:11:06,771 --> 00:11:09,753
Well, there's time
for everything I guess.

132
00:11:36,859 --> 00:11:38,328
Dani Fielding?

133
00:11:40,822 --> 00:11:41,795
Who wants to know?

134
00:11:41,859 --> 00:11:45,789
The sheriff sent me. He said
Dr. Sam had an emergency call so...

135
00:11:46,235 --> 00:11:47,771
I'm sorry, I'm Kevin Winslow.

136
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,365
- I can grab these if you like.
- I can get them.

137
00:11:50,858 --> 00:11:51,732
Are you sure?

138
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,837
Yes, I'm sure.

139
00:11:54,304 --> 00:11:56,944
Alright, suit yourself.

140
00:12:20,598 --> 00:12:21,491
Wow!

141
00:12:21,597 --> 00:12:23,418
You were really good whistler.

142
00:12:23,605 --> 00:12:24,965
I am?

143
00:12:25,098 --> 00:12:27,224
Well, thanks.

144
00:12:29,204 --> 00:12:31,481
- Do you know my uncle?
- Dr. Sam?

145
00:12:31,662 --> 00:12:33,815
Yeah. Everyone knows him.

146
00:12:34,251 --> 00:12:35,474
Do you like him?

147
00:12:35,814 --> 00:12:38,161
Well, yeah.

148
00:12:38,494 --> 00:12:39,801
Don't you?

149
00:12:40,284 --> 00:12:41,284
I don't know.

150
00:12:41,517 --> 00:12:43,553
I only met him once when I was six.

151
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:46,363
Has he ever treated you for anything?

152
00:12:48,247 --> 00:12:51,307
For what?
Hoof and mouth disease?

153
00:12:52,224 --> 00:12:53,590
Get in.

154
00:12:54,545 --> 00:12:55,977
Wait, what?

155
00:13:15,472 --> 00:13:18,755
You know your uncle's a vet?
Right?

156
00:13:19,569 --> 00:13:21,002
Don't know.

157
00:13:35,377 --> 00:13:37,750
Diesel!
What's up buddy?

158
00:13:38,797 --> 00:13:41,229
What's up Diesel?
Who's a good boy?

159
00:13:42,599 --> 00:13:44,392
Need some help?

160
00:13:53,574 --> 00:13:55,124
Diesel, huh?

161
00:13:56,273 --> 00:13:57,870
Yeah.  A good name, huh?

162
00:13:58,384 --> 00:14:00,877
Yeah, if you're a tractor.

163
00:14:02,005 --> 00:14:03,461
All right, I'm  taking off.

164
00:14:03,908 --> 00:14:06,275
Okay.
Thanks for the ride.

165
00:14:06,348 --> 00:14:07,701
Don't mention it.

166
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,290
Hello?

167
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,464
Hello?

168
00:14:39,999 --> 00:14:41,912
Uncle Sam?

169
00:14:52,553 --> 00:14:54,459
Is anybody home?

170
00:14:57,266 --> 00:14:58,587
Ew.

171
00:15:03,682 --> 00:15:05,249
Arg!

172
00:15:06,622 --> 00:15:09,856
Apparently he thinks
garbage takes itself out.

173
00:15:13,175 --> 00:15:15,041
Diesel, huh?

174
00:15:16,068 --> 00:15:18,108
You want to help me clean?

175
00:15:22,573 --> 00:15:24,088
Smart dog.

176
00:15:26,075 --> 00:15:27,321
Ew.

177
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:46,947
It's a disaster.

178
00:15:47,094 --> 00:15:49,388
Really. It doesn't even
feel like I'm on Earth.

179
00:15:51,523 --> 00:15:53,064
I miss you too.

180
00:15:53,997 --> 00:15:56,277
Oh here I am.
I have to go.

181
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:02,273
So, you made it okay?

182
00:16:02,646 --> 00:16:06,559
Sorry, uh, I-I didn't
hear you come in.

183
00:16:07,179 --> 00:16:09,386
The-the-the door was open.

184
00:16:09,553 --> 00:16:11,463
Extra bedroom this way.

185
00:16:11,742 --> 00:16:14,236
Are you sure you can find it?

186
00:16:16,829 --> 00:16:19,905
I cleaned up the bed,
it was kind of covered up.

187
00:16:20,832 --> 00:16:22,232
Oh, ha, ha.

188
00:16:22,545 --> 00:16:24,172
I think you oughta found it.

189
00:16:24,372 --> 00:16:27,189
You know, I got chores.
So I let you get settled down.

190
00:16:48,005 --> 00:16:50,245
That is much better.

191
00:17:12,356 --> 00:17:14,212
- They gave me...
- Oh!

192
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:17,909
I'm sorry.

193
00:17:18,169 --> 00:17:20,156
I guess you're not used
to having people around.

194
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:22,049
No, no, I'm not.

195
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:25,836
Are you hungry?

196
00:17:28,512 --> 00:17:31,739
- Maybe we could go out to eat.
- You like chilli?

197
00:17:34,412 --> 00:17:35,639
Umm...

198
00:17:35,942 --> 00:17:38,525
Yeah, I guess.

199
00:17:39,632 --> 00:17:41,092
Don't you know?

200
00:17:41,647 --> 00:17:43,211
I like it, okay?

201
00:17:47,597 --> 00:17:49,560
I don't know what to do
with stuff in the bedroom,

202
00:17:49,587 --> 00:17:52,100
so I just threw them in the
living room.  I hope that's okay.

203
00:17:52,147 --> 00:17:56,273
I don't want you rearrange my house.
I won't know where to find anything.

204
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:58,122
How do you find anything now?

205
00:17:58,206 --> 00:18:01,762
I have certain piles
I put certain things in.

206
00:18:02,899 --> 00:18:05,997
I can't afford a maid like some.

207
00:18:06,254 --> 00:18:10,043
We didn't have a maid, but
we didn't live like animals either.

208
00:18:10,817 --> 00:18:12,530
Don't you like animals?

209
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,153
Oh, I love animals.

210
00:18:14,353 --> 00:18:16,260
I just don't want to live like one.

211
00:18:16,383 --> 00:18:18,513
You're kind of for yourself ain't you?

212
00:18:18,693 --> 00:18:20,253
I'm what?

213
00:18:20,546 --> 00:18:21,619
Yeah, well...

214
00:18:21,699 --> 00:18:23,153
You live in a dump.

215
00:18:23,199 --> 00:18:24,908
Yeah, well nobody's
ever complained before.

216
00:18:24,953 --> 00:18:27,029
Oh yeah, like who's complaining?
Diesel?

217
00:18:27,162 --> 00:18:29,876
Are you gonna eat or argue?

218
00:18:36,592 --> 00:18:37,428
So,...

219
00:18:37,709 --> 00:18:39,729
you know about daddy's problems?

220
00:18:39,902 --> 00:18:41,322
Nope.

221
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:44,948
- Don't you have an opinion?
- He goes his way, I go mine.

222
00:18:45,738 --> 00:18:48,164
What?  Did you get
into a fight or something?

223
00:18:48,674 --> 00:18:50,984
I know.
We had a disagreement.

224
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:55,097
I... told him long time ago that
I didn't agree with his...

225
00:18:55,229 --> 00:18:58,422
financial schemes and his
"minerakina dogamamie" sense

226
00:18:58,469 --> 00:19:02,012
He doesn't have schemes, okay.
He's an honest man is.

227
00:19:02,146 --> 00:19:04,039
Is that why he's in trouble
with the government?

228
00:19:04,099 --> 00:19:06,877
It's a misunderstanding.
He'll get it cleared up.

229
00:19:07,192 --> 00:19:10,457
I... well, hope he does.
And you can go home.

230
00:19:11,402 --> 00:19:13,682
You know what?
Maybe I'll just leave right now.

231
00:19:13,776 --> 00:19:16,349
- You can't right now.
- Okay. Why not?

232
00:19:17,035 --> 00:19:21,418
Well, because it's gonna get dark soon and
how are you gonna find your way?

233
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,499
Fine.

234
00:19:26,892 --> 00:19:28,986
I'm not hungry.

235
00:19:32,468 --> 00:19:34,052
What did I say?

236
00:19:47,691 --> 00:19:50,234
You can't leave right now,
it's dark outside.

237
00:19:50,608 --> 00:19:52,974
I'll find my way just fine.

238
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,896
Daddy wanted me to give this to you.

239
00:20:10,131 --> 00:20:13,616
And here are some cookies.
If you want them.

240
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,863
Chocolate chip.

241
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:26,995
I guess I made it seem like
it was her fault, didn't I?

242
00:20:27,508 --> 00:20:30,235
You don't have to
always agree with me.

243
00:20:45,568 --> 00:20:47,951
What do you think?
Peace offering?

244
00:20:51,102 --> 00:20:54,232
I'm not apologizing, allright.
I'm just being nice.

245
00:21:31,775 --> 00:21:34,039
Ah! Morning.

246
00:21:34,312 --> 00:21:35,566
I made you breakfast.

247
00:21:35,644 --> 00:21:37,434
Thanks for the present.

248
00:21:39,009 --> 00:21:41,422
Yeah well.
It wasn't much.

249
00:21:43,714 --> 00:21:47,224
I don't eat meat.
I'm a vegetarian.

250
00:21:51,467 --> 00:21:55,010
Well, I'm a Sagittarian.
Here you go, Diesel.

251
00:22:00,344 --> 00:22:02,445
Zucchini is a vegetables.

252
00:22:04,191 --> 00:22:05,941
Do you have any Ranch dressing?

253
00:22:05,994 --> 00:22:07,307
Nope.

254
00:22:09,088 --> 00:22:10,554
Salsa?

255
00:22:10,742 --> 00:22:11,908
No.

256
00:22:13,345 --> 00:22:15,745
Do you have any condiments?

257
00:22:16,692 --> 00:22:18,465
Ketchup.

258
00:22:22,652 --> 00:22:24,206
Arg!

259
00:22:38,794 --> 00:22:40,471
Really?

260
00:22:41,158 --> 00:22:43,052
Those were really good.

261
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:54,422
- Hi, Sam.
- Jody.

262
00:22:55,256 --> 00:22:57,312
- Well, this must be Dani.
- Hi.

263
00:22:57,412 --> 00:22:59,455
Hi, Jody Peterson.

264
00:23:00,664 --> 00:23:04,278
Oh Sam, you must be
the worst cook in state.

265
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:06,784
Her first day here and all
you give her is zucchini?

266
00:23:06,832 --> 00:23:09,575
Well, I didn't know
there was a menu requirement.

267
00:23:10,006 --> 00:23:11,896
You've been alone way too long.

268
00:23:12,103 --> 00:23:14,416
I'm not alone.
Am I Diesel?

269
00:23:16,237 --> 00:23:18,940
Here, honey.
Have one of these.

270
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:24,386
Mmm, excellent.

271
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,236
What? You didn't feed
her last night, neither?

272
00:23:30,316 --> 00:23:31,587
She didn't want any.

273
00:23:31,703 --> 00:23:34,823
Didn't want any what?
Your six-year-old chilli?

274
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,387
What's wrong with chilli?

275
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:41,220
You know, for a horse doctor,
you don't have much horse sense.

276
00:23:41,767 --> 00:23:44,162
You know, I wasn't feeding horses.

277
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:49,010
Well here, Sam.  I brought you some pay
for the house call you made the other day.

278
00:23:49,063 --> 00:23:51,128
You don't owe me anything.
I told you already.

279
00:23:51,226 --> 00:23:53,266
What is it with women, anyway?

280
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:57,180
Well.

281
00:23:58,731 --> 00:24:01,078
It takes some getting use to.

282
00:24:01,171 --> 00:24:03,505
Yeah, I figured that.

283
00:24:03,598 --> 00:24:06,341
He's never had to care
about anybody else.

284
00:24:06,721 --> 00:24:09,801
Because there's never been
anybody else around here.

285
00:24:10,126 --> 00:24:13,089
Especially not a...
young one like yourself.

286
00:24:13,156 --> 00:24:15,729
You know, that's just
something from Mars to him.

287
00:24:15,969 --> 00:24:19,899
Ha ha. Hmm...
I thought this was Mars.

288
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:21,988
You just hold your ground.

289
00:24:22,392 --> 00:24:26,434
You know, let that old rooster care
about somebody else for a change.

290
00:24:28,168 --> 00:24:33,011
He told me that you were some
sort of umm... champion show rider.

291
00:24:33,211 --> 00:24:34,615
I am.

292
00:24:34,962 --> 00:24:37,189
I had a thoroughbred.

293
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,849
His name was Admiral.

294
00:24:40,749 --> 00:24:41,916
Oh.

295
00:24:42,152 --> 00:24:44,062
You had to give him up?

296
00:24:45,156 --> 00:24:47,116
I had to give up everything.

297
00:24:49,482 --> 00:24:50,735
Hey!

298
00:24:51,128 --> 00:24:53,021
Why don't you come with me.

299
00:25:05,243 --> 00:25:06,916
You need to clean up that pigsty.

300
00:25:06,979 --> 00:25:08,649
Oh yeah, I'll get around to it.

301
00:25:08,782 --> 00:25:10,456
When?  Fourth of July?

302
00:25:10,589 --> 00:25:12,345
Wasn't thinking that soon.

303
00:25:12,606 --> 00:25:14,039
You know, she's been through a lot.

304
00:25:14,106 --> 00:25:16,265
You know what,
that-that ain't my fault.

305
00:25:16,399 --> 00:25:18,899
Well, she needs somebody
who loves and cares about her.

306
00:25:19,192 --> 00:25:21,629
I do that, just not at the same time.

307
00:25:21,849 --> 00:25:23,003
Hi!

308
00:25:23,237 --> 00:25:24,504
Hey.

309
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:27,162
Come here.
I've got something for you.

310
00:25:34,746 --> 00:25:37,413
Oh, he's adorable.

311
00:25:37,548 --> 00:25:41,640
- He's small, but he'll grow.
- Oh hi, little guy.

312
00:25:42,052 --> 00:25:44,724
And I want you to have him.

313
00:25:45,938 --> 00:25:46,859
Me?

314
00:25:46,938 --> 00:25:49,749
Yeah, it's... you know,
like a... like a welcome present.

315
00:25:49,825 --> 00:25:51,032
A mule?

316
00:25:51,139 --> 00:25:53,382
Yeah.
A perfect place for him.

317
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:56,482
We already got
one jackass around here.

318
00:26:00,888 --> 00:26:02,768
He's had a rough time.

319
00:26:03,508 --> 00:26:04,835
Why? What happened?

320
00:26:04,908 --> 00:26:07,535
Big storm up in Cedar Briggs.

321
00:26:07,949 --> 00:26:09,965
His mum was killed by wolves.

322
00:26:10,105 --> 00:26:13,272
That much little guy huddled
in Cedars the next day.

323
00:26:13,545 --> 00:26:15,255
Well, it's the first time...

324
00:26:15,455 --> 00:26:18,361
he hasn't bitten anybody
who got close to him.

325
00:26:18,507 --> 00:26:20,975
Not everybody is like you.

326
00:26:25,378 --> 00:26:27,636
So what you gonna name him?

327
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:30,069
Uh...

328
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:32,906
Stormy.

329
00:26:33,619 --> 00:26:35,193
That's a good choice.

330
00:26:37,121 --> 00:26:39,475
Well, it was really nice meeting you.

331
00:26:40,042 --> 00:26:42,089
You're gonna fit in
just fine around here.

332
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:46,949
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.

333
00:26:54,092 --> 00:26:56,032
So you gonna train him?

334
00:26:56,846 --> 00:26:58,053
Stormy?

335
00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:00,859
Umm... I don't think
you can train a mule.

336
00:27:01,166 --> 00:27:04,522
Well you can't, but
you can outsmart him.

337
00:27:05,089 --> 00:27:06,815
Outsmart him?

338
00:27:09,422 --> 00:27:11,447
My back screen door squeaks.

339
00:27:11,581 --> 00:27:14,801
Every time I open it,
cats come running.

340
00:27:15,981 --> 00:27:17,504
Lucky you.

341
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:20,731
Well, they know that
I'm bringing them food scraps.

342
00:27:20,911 --> 00:27:23,218
Cats can't be trained either,
but these are.

343
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:25,554
Based on the screen door opening.

344
00:27:27,826 --> 00:27:29,720
You think I could
train Stormy like that?

345
00:27:29,803 --> 00:27:30,910
Sure.

346
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:35,283
If you work hard enough you can
get any animal to respond to you.

347
00:27:36,002 --> 00:27:39,338
Look, I gotta go and vaccinate
the Winslows' horses this morning.

348
00:27:39,585 --> 00:27:42,986
I'll be back in the afternoon.

349
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,273
Look.

350
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,925
I'm sorry about your dad.
I hope he gets things worked out.

351
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,263
Thanks.

352
00:27:59,127 --> 00:28:01,954
Of course a zebra
can't change its stripes.

353
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,828
I forgot something in the house.
I'll be right back.

354
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:12,210
That's alright.

355
00:28:14,143 --> 00:28:15,702
How are you doing?

356
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:18,309
Okay.
You?

357
00:28:18,491 --> 00:28:19,851
I'm good.

358
00:28:20,211 --> 00:28:22,098
I heard you got a mule.

359
00:28:22,538 --> 00:28:25,346
- Yeah.
- They're not worth much, you know?

360
00:28:25,986 --> 00:28:28,393
Well, that's what my dad always says.

361
00:28:31,072 --> 00:28:34,295
- Okay, I'm ready to go.
- Sweet.

362
00:28:48,598 --> 00:28:50,028
Hi.

363
00:28:52,501 --> 00:28:54,255
You're pretty cute.

364
00:29:02,374 --> 00:29:03,654
Okay.

365
00:29:05,221 --> 00:29:06,881
It's okay.

366
00:29:08,241 --> 00:29:09,456
You're fine.

367
00:29:10,028 --> 00:29:11,765
You're okay, baby.

368
00:29:15,452 --> 00:29:17,348
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey.
Calm down.

369
00:29:19,617 --> 00:29:21,595
Just taste it.

370
00:29:22,221 --> 00:29:23,807
Okay. Okay.

371
00:29:28,643 --> 00:29:30,230
Come on.

372
00:30:25,654 --> 00:30:27,237
- Hello?
- Hi

373
00:30:27,431 --> 00:30:28,764
Dad!

374
00:30:29,284 --> 00:30:31,384
W-When are you gonna...

375
00:30:33,317 --> 00:30:34,444
Oh.

376
00:30:35,809 --> 00:30:39,382
Yeah, but Dad, I really need
a new phone.  I can't even call...

377
00:30:41,856 --> 00:30:44,206
Yeah.
I'll go...

378
00:30:44,486 --> 00:30:46,673
He's here.

379
00:30:47,673 --> 00:30:49,253
It's Dad.

380
00:30:57,206 --> 00:30:59,599
I figured I'd hear from you.

381
00:31:03,934 --> 00:31:05,728
You want some training?

382
00:31:06,468 --> 00:31:07,515
Umm...

383
00:31:07,688 --> 00:31:08,929
Sort of.

384
00:31:09,165 --> 00:31:11,578
Not really much else
to do around here.

385
00:31:11,711 --> 00:31:12,531
Hmm.

386
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:16,000
- You like corn bread?
- Oh, I adore corn bread.

387
00:31:16,043 --> 00:31:19,150
Well, so does Sam,
but he'll never admit it.

388
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,974
Because he never says anything nice.

389
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:23,978
Oh... he tries... sometimes.

390
00:31:24,172 --> 00:31:26,212
No, he doesn't.

391
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:32,404
You wish he would, don't you?

392
00:31:32,911 --> 00:31:34,498
You should just tell him.

393
00:31:35,037 --> 00:31:37,160
He doesn't get that kind of thing.

394
00:31:38,234 --> 00:31:40,007
Has Kevin been around?

395
00:31:40,156 --> 00:31:42,090
Ah yeah, a little bit.

396
00:31:42,551 --> 00:31:43,697
Hmm.

397
00:31:43,937 --> 00:31:45,477
He's cute, huh?

398
00:31:46,149 --> 00:31:48,943
I think he thinks he's cure.
Don't know if I do.

399
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:50,605
Yeah well...

400
00:31:50,899 --> 00:31:53,552
He's got a girlfriend,
but I think he likes you.

401
00:31:53,592 --> 00:31:54,895
Oh, I highly doubt that.

402
00:31:55,022 --> 00:31:56,695
Well, he asked about you the other day.

403
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:59,135
Yeah, just so he would know
when to avoid me.

404
00:31:59,202 --> 00:32:03,111
No, it was more than that.
I've seen that look before.

405
00:32:05,984 --> 00:32:08,025
You're welcome, Sam.

406
00:32:08,485 --> 00:32:10,572
I know.
Thanks.

407
00:32:11,213 --> 00:32:12,778
I got to run.

408
00:32:16,544 --> 00:32:18,414
Do you like Jody?

409
00:32:18,834 --> 00:32:20,448
Well, I like everybody.

410
00:32:20,549 --> 00:32:24,264
No, I mean...
Do you like Jody?

411
00:32:24,884 --> 00:32:27,430
- What?
- Uh-huh. Well...

412
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,412
She sure likes you.

413
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:35,949
No, she doesn't.  She just
likes having a cheap vet.

414
00:32:39,906 --> 00:32:42,173
- Get those chores done?
- Yes, I did them.

415
00:32:42,226 --> 00:32:43,780
- All of them?
- All of them.

416
00:32:43,853 --> 00:32:44,987
Uh huh.

417
00:32:45,525 --> 00:32:46,860
Who is this?

418
00:32:47,439 --> 00:32:51,265
Wicked witch of the West.
What is she doing here?

419
00:32:54,845 --> 00:32:58,185
- Hey.
- Jordan!  Hey you!

420
00:33:00,866 --> 00:33:02,908
Uncle Sam, this is Jordan.

421
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:04,721
Hey, Jordan.
Nice to meet you.

422
00:33:04,808 --> 00:33:06,584
Got something to show you.

423
00:33:06,858 --> 00:33:08,458
Have fun.

424
00:33:08,674 --> 00:33:09,984
Yeah.

425
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:21,021
Hmm.

426
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:24,892
It's Sam, right?

427
00:33:25,733 --> 00:33:27,106
Yeah.

428
00:33:28,229 --> 00:33:31,229
I'm Vanessa Fielding.
We spoke once.

429
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:33,889
Oh!  What did we say?

430
00:33:38,041 --> 00:33:41,895
- So this is Stormy.
- Cool.

431
00:33:44,611 --> 00:33:46,131
Like that?

432
00:33:46,332 --> 00:33:48,725
Why can't all we just be together?

433
00:33:49,747 --> 00:33:50,987
Umm.

434
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:55,053
- It's complicated.
- Mom's a complication, huh?

435
00:33:55,265 --> 00:33:57,579
Have you talked with
your brother recently?

436
00:33:57,655 --> 00:33:59,275
Yeah a couple of days ago.

437
00:33:59,615 --> 00:34:01,722
Did he tell you he's run out of money?

438
00:34:01,852 --> 00:34:04,902
Well, he's in jail, so it's kind
of hard to get to an ATM.

439
00:34:06,107 --> 00:34:09,143
No, I-I mean he stopped
paying child support.

440
00:34:10,049 --> 00:34:13,961
Huh, and you came all the way
out here, just to tell me that?

441
00:34:15,314 --> 00:34:16,321
Look.

442
00:34:16,646 --> 00:34:19,557
Are able to help with
Mitch's obligations or not?

443
00:34:19,867 --> 00:34:21,352
I have been, I got Dani.

444
00:34:21,433 --> 00:34:25,589
No, I mean his other obligation.
Your nephew.

445
00:34:28,236 --> 00:34:31,932
No, he asked me to look after Dani.
Never mentioned anything else.

446
00:34:32,145 --> 00:34:37,129
I know Mitch has cash stored
in some offshore accounts.

447
00:34:37,172 --> 00:34:41,525
- You know that for a fact, do you?
- Oh yes, because I know Mitch.

448
00:34:42,252 --> 00:34:45,063
Maybe we could help
each other out here.

449
00:34:46,213 --> 00:34:48,926
Can't you just be my guardian?

450
00:34:50,726 --> 00:34:52,566
I wish I could, Bud.

451
00:34:52,915 --> 00:34:55,169
It's okay.
You're not that far away.

452
00:34:55,295 --> 00:34:59,149
Staying with Aunt Mildred's awful.
She's even worse than mom.

453
00:34:59,286 --> 00:35:02,062
- I doubt that.
- Trust me.

454
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:07,232
What does she want now?

455
00:35:08,066 --> 00:35:09,599
Come on.

456
00:35:11,948 --> 00:35:15,495
- Well, we just got here.
- And now we're leaving.

457
00:35:15,555 --> 00:35:17,088
Just get in.

458
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,130
She's a nice lady.

459
00:35:25,377 --> 00:35:28,623
Yeah, tell me about it.

460
00:35:30,958 --> 00:35:33,072
But don't let it get to you, okay?

461
00:35:33,487 --> 00:35:38,478
It's not... It's not her, it's Jordan.
She doesn't care about him.

462
00:35:40,713 --> 00:35:43,468
Maybe we can do
something about that.

463
00:35:46,501 --> 00:35:49,184
- So, when they going to need a booster?
- In a year.

464
00:35:49,317 --> 00:35:50,684
Here you go, Sam.

465
00:35:51,004 --> 00:35:52,357
Thank you.

466
00:35:52,764 --> 00:35:54,171
Oh, that's too much.

467
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:58,669
Oh Sam, you saved War Cloud
from pneumonia, should be more.

468
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:01,023
It's not necessary.

469
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:04,656
Ah Sam, look.  If you
won't do it for my horse

470
00:36:04,756 --> 00:36:07,129
then why don't you put it
away for raising a teenager.

471
00:36:07,243 --> 00:36:09,231
I know what that cost.

472
00:36:11,026 --> 00:36:12,502
What's that?

473
00:36:13,319 --> 00:36:16,119
It's a poster of the regional
horse show, that is coming up.

474
00:36:16,532 --> 00:36:18,192
I'll take instead.

475
00:36:18,406 --> 00:36:20,026
No Sam, take 'em both.

476
00:36:20,192 --> 00:36:21,939
No.
Poster will do.

477
00:36:25,911 --> 00:36:26,981
Good day.

478
00:36:27,234 --> 00:36:29,640
- See you.
- All right.

479
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,999
He's different.

480
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,613
What do you mean?

481
00:36:36,846 --> 00:36:38,119
I don't know.

482
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:41,180
Always doing stuff
for everybody but himself.

483
00:36:42,206 --> 00:36:44,849
A kind of different we can use
more of, don't you think?

484
00:36:45,123 --> 00:36:46,182
Come on.

485
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,141
Having fun?

486
00:36:51,382 --> 00:36:53,641
Yeah, a blast.

487
00:36:53,768 --> 00:36:57,948
- Why don't you try a couple of rocks.
- And do what? Beat it to death?

488
00:37:06,848 --> 00:37:07,922
Oh.

489
00:37:08,001 --> 00:37:10,877
Learned to improvise.
Savvy?

490
00:37:14,703 --> 00:37:16,286
And I...

491
00:37:17,033 --> 00:37:18,613
found this.

492
00:38:59,255 --> 00:39:01,482
Hey!
Didn't see your truck pull in.

493
00:39:01,522 --> 00:39:04,458
- He's riding pretty good.
- Yeah, he's doing really good.

494
00:39:04,585 --> 00:39:09,132
Hmm. Would you like to come over to
our house some time and ride our horses?

495
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:12,566
Your-your thoroughbreds?

496
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,120
Yeah.

497
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:19,516
You know, I think I'm gonna stay here
and work some more with Stormy.

498
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:23,431
There is a dance coming up in
a few weeks,...

499
00:39:23,665 --> 00:39:25,491
Western Stomp.

500
00:39:26,525 --> 00:39:27,798
Oh.

501
00:39:29,552 --> 00:39:31,064
Would you like to go?

502
00:39:31,211 --> 00:39:33,344
With...
With me?

503
00:39:34,395 --> 00:39:37,455
I... thought you had a girlfriend.

504
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,840
Who told you that?

505
00:39:40,214 --> 00:39:41,840
A friend.

506
00:39:42,823 --> 00:39:44,292
I've had one.

507
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,400
W-What happened?

508
00:39:46,499 --> 00:39:49,026
She didn't want me
to see other people.

509
00:39:49,853 --> 00:39:51,666
Other people?

510
00:39:52,166 --> 00:39:54,837
I don't know, people.

511
00:39:56,222 --> 00:40:00,402
I don't know, I don't really
like country music very much.

512
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:02,035
I'll bring ear muffs.

513
00:40:03,841 --> 00:40:05,531
Okay. Umm...

514
00:40:05,731 --> 00:40:08,497
- What should I wear?
- It's up to you.

515
00:40:09,144 --> 00:40:11,830
Okay.
I'll see you there.

516
00:40:12,098 --> 00:40:13,288
All right.

517
00:40:15,566 --> 00:40:17,142
See you.

518
00:40:26,911 --> 00:40:28,663
What are you planning
on doing with her?

519
00:40:28,746 --> 00:40:30,211
- It's a him.
- Oh.

520
00:40:30,251 --> 00:40:33,584
- Doesn't anybody here know the difference?
- Yeah, well, I used to.

521
00:40:34,918 --> 00:40:36,973
I don't know what I'm
planning on doing with them.

522
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,153
- It will be something.
- Hmm.

523
00:40:40,925 --> 00:40:42,948
Jody come around today?

524
00:40:44,209 --> 00:40:45,822
Maybe.

525
00:40:46,264 --> 00:40:48,005
You know, if you were
a little nicer to her,

526
00:40:48,032 --> 00:40:49,949
she might come around
a little more often.

527
00:40:50,251 --> 00:40:51,922
What's that suppose to mean?

528
00:40:52,029 --> 00:40:53,316
Nothing.

529
00:40:55,148 --> 00:40:57,497
- You know, you're like...
- What?

530
00:40:57,564 --> 00:40:59,891
- Summer storm.
- A summer storm?

531
00:40:59,937 --> 00:41:03,713
Yeah.  You rumble a long time before
you finally get where you're going.

532
00:41:04,247 --> 00:41:09,016
Well, I'm going to take a ride up in the
mountains.  Let Jody know, if she comes by.

533
00:41:09,056 --> 00:41:12,216
Oh what...?  So Jody is coming?

534
00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:14,197
Maybe.

535
00:41:17,588 --> 00:41:20,377
Yeah, she's a summer storm, alright.

536
00:41:22,443 --> 00:41:25,863
Diesel, why don't you go with her.
Get a little exercise.

537
00:41:28,836 --> 00:41:30,496
That's what I figured.

538
00:42:05,875 --> 00:42:08,145
I knew you were smart.

539
00:42:08,732 --> 00:42:11,438
That's my boy.
Let's go.

540
00:42:25,601 --> 00:42:28,488
Stormy, no!
Stormy, come back!

541
00:42:38,669 --> 00:42:41,205
Hey, you old dog.
Miss me?

542
00:42:41,703 --> 00:42:43,469
No.

543
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:48,817
- So you got any muffins?
- Oh, plenty.

544
00:42:50,358 --> 00:42:51,697
So where are they?

545
00:42:51,787 --> 00:42:53,134
At home.

546
00:42:53,427 --> 00:42:56,407
Which is where you're gonna
have to go if you want to get some.

547
00:42:56,896 --> 00:42:57,940
What?  Now?

548
00:42:57,986 --> 00:43:01,379
Well, I thought, I'd have you and
Dani over for supper on Sunday.

549
00:43:01,922 --> 00:43:05,889
Well, you don't have to...
ask the girl.

550
00:43:07,278 --> 00:43:09,192
Why is he saddled?

551
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:11,316
Umm, Dani...

552
00:43:11,403 --> 00:43:14,950
- took him out a couple of hours ago.
- You know where she went?

553
00:43:15,275 --> 00:43:17,658
Mountains is only where she's going.

554
00:43:17,825 --> 00:43:19,638
Come on.

555
00:43:21,051 --> 00:43:23,132
Come on.  You know
where she went?  Let's go.

556
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:25,973
Get on.
You know where she is.

557
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:28,195
- Quit bossing.
- Just go.

558
00:43:42,513 --> 00:43:44,324
Stormy!

559
00:43:57,018 --> 00:43:59,058
Stormy!

560
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:07,110
There she is.

561
00:44:12,693 --> 00:44:13,900
What happened?

562
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:16,281
Four wheeler on steroids came by.

563
00:44:16,744 --> 00:44:18,114
Spooked him, huh?

564
00:44:18,347 --> 00:44:19,954
Like you wouldn't believe.

565
00:44:20,103 --> 00:44:23,045
- Well, thanks for the lift.
- You walking back?

566
00:44:23,252 --> 00:44:24,772
Oh, I know how.

567
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:30,310
Uh, you know what, I think that I want
to drive back and check on Stormy.

568
00:44:30,363 --> 00:44:30,964
Huh?

569
00:44:31,035 --> 00:44:32,971
- Good idea.
- It is?

570
00:44:34,205 --> 00:44:36,665
Hey, would you like to come
for dinner on Sunday night?

571
00:44:36,742 --> 00:44:38,869
Yeah, we'd would love to.

572
00:44:53,616 --> 00:44:55,270
Well, now we're on foot.

573
00:44:55,843 --> 00:44:59,332
- You were gonna walk with her any way.
- Yeah, I wanted to impress her.

574
00:44:59,433 --> 00:45:02,739
- What am I?  Chopped liver?
- Close.

575
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,306
Here.

576
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:06,758
Oh, you don't have to pay me
to walk with you.

577
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:08,547
It's for her.

578
00:45:08,861 --> 00:45:09,834
Oh.

579
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:12,142
- You want me to walk with her?
- No.

580
00:45:12,223 --> 00:45:16,209
No!  She's going to some dance with
that Winslow kid.  What's his name?

581
00:45:16,289 --> 00:45:18,349
- Kevin.
- Yeah him. And I...

582
00:45:18,732 --> 00:45:22,412
wanted to buy her
something nice to wear.

583
00:45:22,898 --> 00:45:25,118
I thought you could help with that.

584
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:27,856
Sure.

585
00:45:29,003 --> 00:45:30,629
Thank you.

586
00:45:31,382 --> 00:45:33,162
You're welcome.

587
00:45:35,719 --> 00:45:36,990
What are you having?

588
00:45:37,208 --> 00:45:40,935
- Well, what do you mean?
- For dinner.

589
00:45:41,016 --> 00:45:42,316
Oh, yeah.

590
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:52,208
- Hey, more pie?
- No, you have to stuff it in my pockets.

591
00:45:52,427 --> 00:45:54,861
- It was so good.
- Right.

592
00:45:55,131 --> 00:45:58,020
Hey, I'm going to the city
tomorrow to do a little shopping.

593
00:45:58,054 --> 00:46:00,781
- Would you like to come?
- No, too busy of a day for me.

594
00:46:00,967 --> 00:46:02,458
Not you.

595
00:46:02,888 --> 00:46:05,988
Umm...
Could we maybe go to the prison?

596
00:46:06,981 --> 00:46:09,717
I would like to see my
dad and visit him if I could.

597
00:46:11,204 --> 00:46:12,724
Yeah, sure.

598
00:46:13,343 --> 00:46:15,823
Okay.  Here, I-I can get these.

599
00:46:17,339 --> 00:46:21,313
You realise the prison is an hour
south of the city to get there.

600
00:46:21,423 --> 00:46:23,710
So we'll leave early.

601
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:27,164
It's okay.

602
00:46:46,575 --> 00:46:48,315
Hi, dad.

603
00:46:50,762 --> 00:46:52,002
Hey.

604
00:46:58,248 --> 00:47:00,310
I wish you hadn't come.

605
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:03,270
Why?

606
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:06,292
I mean, it's just far.

607
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,540
You're wasting your time.

608
00:47:10,195 --> 00:47:12,053
How is it with Sam?

609
00:47:13,336 --> 00:47:15,990
Umm...
Well, it...

610
00:47:16,329 --> 00:47:19,516
- takes some getting used to.
- Not like Sam, right?

611
00:47:24,085 --> 00:47:27,343
They offered me a plea bargain.

612
00:47:28,037 --> 00:47:29,871
Do you know what that is?

613
00:47:30,006 --> 00:47:32,216
Umm...
Sort of.

614
00:47:34,686 --> 00:47:37,719
You see, if I plead guilty,
it could uh...

615
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,049
could reduce my sentence.

616
00:47:40,201 --> 00:47:41,671
Take some time off.

617
00:47:42,643 --> 00:47:45,190
You haven't even gone to trial yet.

618
00:47:45,328 --> 00:47:46,281
No.

619
00:47:46,454 --> 00:47:48,767
That's why they're offering me
the plea agreement.

620
00:47:49,481 --> 00:47:51,354
Just to avoid all that.

621
00:47:52,071 --> 00:47:54,977
But you're not guilty,
so don't...don't take it.

622
00:47:55,158 --> 00:47:58,254
This has nothing to do
with guilt or innocence.

623
00:47:59,468 --> 00:48:01,263
It's all about what...

624
00:48:02,009 --> 00:48:04,022
what the jury is gonna believe.

625
00:48:06,043 --> 00:48:08,906
What will they believe?

626
00:48:10,832 --> 00:48:12,905
That I'm guilty.

627
00:48:17,718 --> 00:48:20,707
So have you made any friends?

628
00:48:20,881 --> 00:48:22,328
Uhh...

629
00:48:22,901 --> 00:48:26,824
Well, I am going on a date next week.

630
00:48:27,604 --> 00:48:29,084
That's good.

631
00:48:29,484 --> 00:48:31,497
He's a lucky boy.

632
00:48:31,855 --> 00:48:33,838
And Jordan came by.

633
00:48:34,351 --> 00:48:35,478
I miss him.

634
00:48:35,627 --> 00:48:38,567
Vanessa's trying to get
money from Uncle Sam.

635
00:48:38,767 --> 00:48:40,054
Ah...

636
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:42,340
Dracula lady.

637
00:48:42,987 --> 00:48:46,014
She says that you have money stashed.

638
00:48:47,752 --> 00:48:49,719
She says a lot of things.

639
00:48:51,874 --> 00:48:54,928
I really hope Sam isn't
that bad, sweetheart.

640
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:59,067
Oh, umm...
No, I'm-I'm getting used to it.

641
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,494
And then when you
get past all his quirks,

642
00:49:01,607 --> 00:49:03,680
you'll see his heart
is in the right place.

643
00:49:04,299 --> 00:49:05,999
Are you sure he has one?

644
00:49:06,131 --> 00:49:08,665
Somewhere, underneath all that crust.

645
00:49:18,018 --> 00:49:19,411
Umm.

646
00:49:21,404 --> 00:49:23,076
I'm gonna go.

647
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,702
Okay.  Um...

648
00:49:27,995 --> 00:49:31,388
- I'll-I'll come back as soon as I can...
- No, no.  I don't-I don't...

649
00:49:31,522 --> 00:49:33,962
think this is a good place
for you to come.

650
00:49:36,803 --> 00:49:38,979
- But...
- If something changes, I'll...

651
00:49:40,533 --> 00:49:42,813
I'll ask George to call you.

652
00:49:45,103 --> 00:49:46,271
Yeah.

653
00:49:48,752 --> 00:49:50,658
I really love you.

654
00:49:51,773 --> 00:49:53,820
I love you too, Dad.

655
00:50:24,837 --> 00:50:26,371
How did it go?

656
00:50:26,538 --> 00:50:28,218
Discouraging.

657
00:50:28,664 --> 00:50:31,317
Yeah well, prison does that.

658
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:36,803
I know he's innocent.

659
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:40,011
And nobody will believe me,
not even Uncle Sam.

660
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:43,328
I wouldn't judge him too harshly now.

661
00:50:43,596 --> 00:50:44,896
They're brothers.

662
00:50:44,971 --> 00:50:47,618
Yeah well, so were Cain and Abel.

663
00:50:48,811 --> 00:50:50,758
What does that mean?

664
00:50:51,347 --> 00:50:52,774
Well,...

665
00:50:52,868 --> 00:50:57,587
what that means is that sometimes things
aren't as obvious as you might think.

666
00:50:58,533 --> 00:51:00,944
You probably shouldn't judge him,

667
00:51:01,211 --> 00:51:03,711
as much as you want him
to judge your daddy.

668
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:14,076
That Kevin boy,
he's pretty cute, huh?

669
00:51:15,337 --> 00:51:17,763
Yeah, I guess.

670
00:51:17,907 --> 00:51:21,603
Yeah, well you guys are going
to the dance together, right.

671
00:51:22,163 --> 00:51:23,990
Yeah.  But how did you know that?

672
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:27,602
Well because Sam said he wants
you to have something nice to wear.

673
00:51:28,068 --> 00:51:29,468
He did?

674
00:51:30,002 --> 00:51:33,056
Yup.  He's paying for it.

675
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:35,646
Uncle Sam?

676
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:38,933
Mm hm.
Full of surprises, huh?

677
00:51:41,191 --> 00:51:44,387
- Come on, let's go shopping.
- Oh.

678
00:51:44,741 --> 00:51:45,901
I-I don't know.

679
00:51:45,935 --> 00:51:47,438
Good.
I know just the place.

680
00:51:47,551 --> 00:51:49,531
- Okay.
- Get in.

681
00:52:17,565 --> 00:52:18,925
Hi.

682
00:52:19,385 --> 00:52:20,585
Woh!

683
00:52:20,998 --> 00:52:22,452
You look...

684
00:52:22,985 --> 00:52:24,619
amazing.

685
00:52:26,749 --> 00:52:29,708
Thanks.
I had help picking it out.

686
00:52:36,746 --> 00:52:38,109
Hold it.

687
00:52:38,504 --> 00:52:41,169
- What?
- My truck.

688
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:44,133
- What's the matter with it?
- It sucks.

689
00:52:44,359 --> 00:52:46,499
No, it doesn't.

690
00:52:46,739 --> 00:52:48,442
It's not good enough
for you to ride in,

691
00:52:48,489 --> 00:52:51,509
- not dressed like that.
- Come on, it's fine.

692
00:52:51,676 --> 00:52:53,949
Have her back here by midnight.

693
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:57,299
Ah, I will.

694
00:52:58,754 --> 00:52:59,984
This is for little Annie.

695
00:53:00,037 --> 00:53:02,637
Give her a couple each night
for the next two weeks.

696
00:53:03,463 --> 00:53:04,797
Okay.

697
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:07,916
And midnight for this filly.

698
00:53:08,063 --> 00:53:09,323
Clear?

699
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:11,223
Crystal.

700
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,384
Looks pretty good, doesn't she?

701
00:53:26,731 --> 00:53:27,985
Yeah.

702
00:53:28,564 --> 00:53:30,544
Too good if you ask me.

703
00:53:32,522 --> 00:53:36,275
- Dad, you think I would do it...
- No?  Oh...

704
00:53:36,635 --> 00:53:38,265
- Hey.
- Hey.

705
00:53:38,299 --> 00:53:40,229
- How are your horses doing?
- Good.

706
00:53:40,282 --> 00:53:42,096
- Got a new one.
- You want to see it?

707
00:53:42,306 --> 00:53:44,906
- Yeah, I'd love to.
- Come on.

708
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:47,542
Don't step on anything.

709
00:53:47,922 --> 00:53:49,255
Wouldn't be the first time.

710
00:53:51,479 --> 00:53:54,107
She may have been a competition
horse but we're not sure.

711
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:56,649
With an emphasis on "we're not sure".

712
00:53:56,908 --> 00:53:58,822
But I would like your opinion, though.

713
00:53:59,037 --> 00:54:01,457
Well, Little Annie is beautiful but,

714
00:54:01,563 --> 00:54:04,197
to give you an honest
opinion I'd have to ride her.

715
00:54:04,545 --> 00:54:07,572
- Well, maybe another day.
- No, now's great.

716
00:54:13,187 --> 00:54:15,007
Now it's great.

717
00:54:38,714 --> 00:54:41,484
Well,...
She's had some training.

718
00:54:41,677 --> 00:54:44,770
Not a lot but,
she's sure got potential.

719
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:47,566
What will it take to get her
in performance shape?

720
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:49,013
Umm...

721
00:54:49,093 --> 00:54:50,933
Three months, at least.

722
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:52,827
I'd know more if I work with her.

723
00:54:52,965 --> 00:54:55,145
It's better than riding a dang mule, huh?

724
00:54:56,172 --> 00:54:58,376
Umm...
Yeah, I think.

725
00:54:58,509 --> 00:54:59,909
It can be a pain sometimes.

726
00:54:59,952 --> 00:55:03,889
I don't even know why people have 'em
anymore. They're stupid, they're stubborn.

727
00:55:03,942 --> 00:55:04,965
Yeah.

728
00:55:05,305 --> 00:55:07,425
Just like some people.

729
00:55:07,905 --> 00:55:11,118
Yeah, well you can't skin
and tan some people, huh?

730
00:55:13,486 --> 00:55:15,404
No you can't.

731
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,179
So you want to go to the dance?

732
00:55:22,646 --> 00:55:25,519
No, I want to get back on.

733
00:55:26,848 --> 00:55:28,741
Just afraid of that.

734
00:55:33,571 --> 00:55:34,868
When I get my hands on him...

735
00:55:34,944 --> 00:55:36,687
- You'll what?
- I'll tan his hide.

736
00:55:36,747 --> 00:55:39,660
Oh come on.
He'll drop you like a bag of dirt.

737
00:55:39,717 --> 00:55:42,094
Really?
You know, I'd like to see him try.

738
00:55:42,127 --> 00:55:43,840
Easy there, killer.

739
00:55:44,378 --> 00:55:48,005
You know, you came here to see your
niece dance in her nice new dress.

740
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:50,552
So she left a little early with
a very nice young gentleman

741
00:55:50,612 --> 00:55:54,221
who come from a very nice family.
Give him the benefit of the doubt.

742
00:55:54,281 --> 00:55:56,555
I'll give him the benefit
of the doubt, all right.

743
00:55:56,655 --> 00:55:58,531
Oh Addy Jane!

744
00:55:59,298 --> 00:56:01,325
Have you seen Kevin or Dani?

745
00:56:01,418 --> 00:56:05,037
- No, not since school this afternoon.
- So they weren't here at all?

746
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:08,510
If they were,
we didn't see them.  Sorry.

747
00:56:12,812 --> 00:56:14,786
You know, she could have called.

748
00:56:15,479 --> 00:56:18,499
With what?  You told me her cell
phone's been down for months.

749
00:56:18,532 --> 00:56:20,718
Well, she should have found a way.

750
00:56:21,438 --> 00:56:23,412
How?
A carrier pigeon?

751
00:56:23,478 --> 00:56:25,921
You know, you're worse than she is.

752
00:56:26,248 --> 00:56:28,761
Now you're just an old poop.

753
00:56:29,389 --> 00:56:31,772
I'm not an old poop.

754
00:56:32,172 --> 00:56:34,459
I'm middle aged poop.

755
00:56:35,985 --> 00:56:37,172
Hmm.

756
00:56:40,442 --> 00:56:42,241
I had a lot of fun tonight.

757
00:56:42,701 --> 00:56:44,475
Sorry about your dress.

758
00:56:44,850 --> 00:56:47,028
It's okay, it's just a dress.

759
00:56:47,699 --> 00:56:50,562
You know a lot about
training horses, don't you?

760
00:56:51,152 --> 00:56:52,621
Well, a little bit.

761
00:56:52,962 --> 00:56:54,456
Girls can't surprise you?

762
00:56:54,549 --> 00:56:57,732
Some girls maybe, not you.

763
00:56:59,645 --> 00:57:01,155
What is that suppose to mean?

764
00:57:01,195 --> 00:57:04,392
Easy.
I didn't mean anything by it.

765
00:57:05,258 --> 00:57:06,672
Sorry.

766
00:57:07,025 --> 00:57:09,224
Guess I'm a little touchy.

767
00:57:09,265 --> 00:57:10,799
Or defensive.

768
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:13,006
I suppose you got your reasons.

769
00:57:13,049 --> 00:57:16,019
We didn't really get off on
the right foot anyway.

770
00:57:16,505 --> 00:57:18,015
No, we didn't.

771
00:57:18,941 --> 00:57:20,945
I'd like to make up for it.

772
00:57:23,104 --> 00:57:25,107
Yeah, it's alright.

773
00:57:25,133 --> 00:57:26,927
Late by two minutes.

774
00:57:27,187 --> 00:57:29,580
Yeah, I wanted to make
sure she's home in time.

775
00:57:29,687 --> 00:57:30,920
Mm hm.

776
00:57:32,287 --> 00:57:34,300
How come you didn't go to the dance?

777
00:57:34,434 --> 00:57:36,227
You spied on me?

778
00:57:36,274 --> 00:57:39,857
No, no.  I wanted to see
how my investment looked.

779
00:57:40,577 --> 00:57:42,124
Well,...

780
00:57:44,465 --> 00:57:45,876
You had a fight?

781
00:57:46,349 --> 00:57:48,142
We never left my place.

782
00:57:48,211 --> 00:57:52,116
I went and rode little Annie.
Mr. Winslow wanted my opinion of her

783
00:57:52,162 --> 00:57:55,111
and the only way to give him
an honest one was to ride her.

784
00:57:56,486 --> 00:58:00,202
So Mr Winslow was there all night?

785
00:58:00,489 --> 00:58:02,455
Yeah, the whole time.

786
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:07,187
And you rode little Annie in your dress?

787
00:58:07,728 --> 00:58:09,994
Yeah, that was what I was wearing.

788
00:58:11,243 --> 00:58:12,346
Thank you.

789
00:58:12,646 --> 00:58:14,533
I had the best time tonight.

790
00:58:14,707 --> 00:58:17,239
The most fun I've had the
whole time I've been here.

791
00:58:26,015 --> 00:58:28,031
I suppose I owe you an apology.

792
00:58:28,232 --> 00:58:29,705
No, you don't.

793
00:58:30,426 --> 00:58:32,745
It was the best night in my life.

794
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:39,872
Yeah, if it wasn't for my mouth,
I wouldn't have any place to put my feet.

795
00:58:47,655 --> 00:58:49,795
I wanna do it, Stormy.

796
00:58:51,189 --> 00:58:53,836
I think with little Annie,
I could really win it.

797
00:58:54,816 --> 00:58:56,043
But,...

798
00:58:56,429 --> 00:58:59,642
that would mean more time
with her and less time with you.

799
00:59:01,027 --> 00:59:02,957
Are you okay with that?

800
00:59:04,697 --> 00:59:06,150
I love you.

801
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:13,703
- Morning.
- Morning.

802
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:15,429
You're up early.

803
00:59:15,509 --> 00:59:17,712
Yeah, felt like kind
it was a pretty daylight.

804
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,433
Made you breakfast.

805
00:59:19,573 --> 00:59:20,620
Hmm.

806
00:59:22,315 --> 00:59:23,747
You umm...

807
00:59:24,321 --> 00:59:25,968
clean up in here?

808
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:28,867
Yeah, a little bit.

809
00:59:31,366 --> 00:59:32,549
There's no bacon.

810
00:59:32,729 --> 00:59:34,776
Do you want to have a heart attack?

811
00:59:34,959 --> 00:59:37,482
Don't worry, I'll fix it.
I'm a doctor.

812
00:59:37,829 --> 00:59:39,823
No, you're a vet.

813
00:59:39,948 --> 00:59:41,979
Yeah, a vet who likes bacon.

814
00:59:43,333 --> 00:59:47,558
So Kevin's dad asked
me to train little Annie.

815
00:59:48,966 --> 00:59:51,148
Really?
You up to it?

816
00:59:51,735 --> 00:59:54,161
Yeah. I think I know what I'm doing.

817
00:59:54,389 --> 00:59:55,585
I wish I did.

818
00:59:55,792 --> 00:59:57,759
What about your chores around here?

819
00:59:57,976 --> 01:00:01,512
Well, I was kind of hoping maybe
you could help me out with them.

820
01:00:01,796 --> 01:00:04,035
Just until I'm done training
little Annie. I mean, I...

821
01:00:04,109 --> 01:00:06,229
I barely have time
to get her in shape as it is.

822
01:00:06,356 --> 01:00:07,083
Hmm.

823
01:00:07,153 --> 01:00:08,863
What about Stormy?

824
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:13,197
Stormy, he'll be fine.

825
01:00:13,553 --> 01:00:15,073
Well, maybe.

826
01:00:15,453 --> 01:00:18,146
She's kind of getting used to
you spending a lot of time with her.

827
01:00:18,266 --> 01:00:21,275
Well, you won't care if just me.

828
01:00:21,918 --> 01:00:23,213
Okay.

829
01:00:23,747 --> 01:00:25,367
Uh...

830
01:00:25,534 --> 01:00:27,201
There's something else.

831
01:00:27,593 --> 01:00:28,960
What's that?

832
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:31,084
I really like that dress,

833
01:00:31,470 --> 01:00:34,401
but I think daddy wanted me to
use the money for something else.

834
01:00:34,842 --> 01:00:36,286
What money?

835
01:00:37,035 --> 01:00:38,008
Uh...

836
01:00:38,143 --> 01:00:41,408
The money that I gave you,
the first time I was here.

837
01:00:41,501 --> 01:00:43,731
Yeah, yeah, right.

838
01:00:48,404 --> 01:00:51,546
Here you go.
Do whatever you want with it.

839
01:00:56,467 --> 01:01:00,133
- You haven't opened it.
- Why would I do that? It's not mine.

840
01:01:01,103 --> 01:01:04,256
Look, I just thought that you
would have used the money to...

841
01:01:04,296 --> 01:01:05,486
About what?

842
01:01:09,174 --> 01:01:10,832
It's Kevin.

843
01:01:16,390 --> 01:01:17,866
I'm sorry.

844
01:01:18,347 --> 01:01:19,540
Why?

845
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:23,053
B-Because I thought, that
you use the money to...

846
01:01:24,447 --> 01:01:26,471
You better not keep him waiting.

847
01:01:35,701 --> 01:01:36,950
She likes training their horse

848
01:01:37,025 --> 01:01:40,685
but that's not the only thing she likes
slow at the Winslow ranch, is it?

849
01:01:43,252 --> 01:01:44,740
Yeah, you said it.

850
01:01:44,927 --> 01:01:48,727
Most teenage girls must
drive their fathers crazy.

851
01:01:51,403 --> 01:01:53,281
Really wish I had some bacon.

852
01:03:00,872 --> 01:03:03,818
You know, maybe you can
try a little chicken or steak.

853
01:03:04,353 --> 01:03:09,049
You know, something different.
You don't have to eat it.

854
01:03:10,424 --> 01:03:12,398
You better get it from
the store and I'll fix it.

855
01:03:12,478 --> 01:03:13,886
Okay.

856
01:03:16,996 --> 01:03:20,046
- Has he been fed?
- Huh? Yeah.

857
01:03:20,432 --> 01:03:22,426
But I'm not you.

858
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:25,103
What do you mean?

859
01:03:26,410 --> 01:03:27,844
He's lonely.

860
01:03:28,152 --> 01:03:29,738
He's a mule.

861
01:03:31,312 --> 01:03:33,239
Mules have feelings.

862
01:03:51,528 --> 01:03:53,786
Alright darling, come on out.

863
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:03,149
- You going somewhere?
- Yes, and he can't come with me.

864
01:04:04,681 --> 01:04:06,271
So you brought him here?

865
01:04:06,378 --> 01:04:08,531
Yes, well, you're his uncle.

866
01:04:08,642 --> 01:04:10,988
Well, you're his mother.
You outrank me.

867
01:04:11,428 --> 01:04:13,647
I can't take him with me.

868
01:04:15,433 --> 01:04:17,278
You asked what he wants?

869
01:04:18,045 --> 01:04:19,878
This is best for everyone.

870
01:04:19,947 --> 01:04:21,330
Yeah sure.

871
01:04:21,824 --> 01:04:25,123
You uh... don't you even
want to say goodbye to him?

872
01:04:25,223 --> 01:04:27,195
Oh, I did already.

873
01:04:40,695 --> 01:04:43,359
Well, I guess you could
help me with some chores.

874
01:04:44,043 --> 01:04:47,128
- See if you can get Stormy to eat.
- What's the matter with him?

875
01:04:47,215 --> 01:04:48,938
Well, he's off his feed.

876
01:04:49,038 --> 01:04:50,585
I think that he's...

877
01:04:50,952 --> 01:04:52,438
lonely.

878
01:04:54,570 --> 01:04:56,873
Should get you settled
in first, though uh?

879
01:04:57,839 --> 01:05:00,120
You don't seem too
upset that she's leaving.

880
01:05:00,477 --> 01:05:02,533
She's always running away.

881
01:05:02,667 --> 01:05:04,087
That's a good point.

882
01:05:04,130 --> 01:05:05,527
- Where's Dani?
- She ran away.

883
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:06,792
She did?

884
01:05:07,232 --> 01:05:11,325
No, no.  She's working
with a filly down the road.

885
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:12,892
Come on.

886
01:05:14,758 --> 01:05:17,281
You think my Mom went
too far, don't you?

887
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:20,334
Yup, and I hope she stays there.

888
01:05:27,313 --> 01:05:30,093
- You know my sister is coming next week.
- Yeah, I know, I know.

889
01:05:30,133 --> 01:05:32,392
I was hoping you could
help me with the kid.

890
01:05:32,932 --> 01:05:35,075
You need to get to know him better.

891
01:05:35,188 --> 01:05:37,089
This kid used to be the first one.

892
01:05:37,248 --> 01:05:39,855
Well, take him with you.
It will be good for the both of you.

893
01:05:40,228 --> 01:05:42,348
I'll come back around this afternoon.

894
01:05:42,619 --> 01:05:43,734
You promise?

895
01:05:43,947 --> 01:05:45,414
Scout's honor.

896
01:05:45,828 --> 01:05:47,507
You're not a Scout.

897
01:05:48,328 --> 01:05:50,354
I'm not an uncle either.

898
01:06:06,935 --> 01:06:08,006
Howdy.

899
01:06:08,086 --> 01:06:09,289
Good morning, Sam.

900
01:06:09,476 --> 01:06:11,469
- Who is this? Your new assistant?
- Yup.

901
01:06:11,515 --> 01:06:13,035
I'm Dani's little brother.

902
01:06:13,089 --> 01:06:15,749
- Well, hello there, Dani's little brother.
- Hi.

903
01:06:15,856 --> 01:06:17,812
- Dani's over the other corral.
- Cool.

904
01:06:17,865 --> 01:06:19,932
- Go on.
- Good kid.

905
01:06:20,019 --> 01:06:22,992
Hey, thanks for coming out this morning.
Can I talk to you about something?

906
01:06:23,052 --> 01:06:24,368
- Sure.
- Okay.

907
01:06:33,241 --> 01:06:34,620
Hey, Dani!

908
01:06:34,664 --> 01:06:36,031
Hey!

909
01:06:39,544 --> 01:06:41,006
Hey kiddo!

910
01:06:41,306 --> 01:06:44,500
- Hey, you said you miss me.
- Of course, I missed you.

911
01:06:44,587 --> 01:06:47,980
- Who is this?
- This is Little Annie.

912
01:06:48,060 --> 01:06:50,947
- I've been working with her.
- What about Stormy?

913
01:06:51,076 --> 01:06:54,470
Uh... Well, this is kind of more like
the stuff I used to do with Admiral.

914
01:06:54,556 --> 01:06:55,699
Cool.

915
01:06:56,339 --> 01:06:57,653
Come on, Bud.

916
01:06:58,906 --> 01:07:00,582
She's spending a lot of time here.

917
01:07:00,629 --> 01:07:03,022
Yeah, well the event's
coming up soon, Doc.

918
01:07:03,494 --> 01:07:05,029
I just don't get to see her that much.

919
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:07,042
Now look, I'm not trying
to keep her from you.

920
01:07:07,081 --> 01:07:08,231
Oh, I know that.

921
01:07:08,317 --> 01:07:11,577
Ah, it's the competition.
I need that filly to do well.

922
01:07:11,691 --> 01:07:13,850
And Dani is doing
a great job with her.

923
01:07:13,910 --> 01:07:17,020
Yeah, I get it, you know.
She's got her heart set on this, so...

924
01:07:19,176 --> 01:07:20,994
I missed you!

925
01:07:21,547 --> 01:07:25,723
Hey.  Vanessa came by and
dropped him off this morning.

926
01:07:25,790 --> 01:07:28,937
- So, he's staying?
- Well, for a while.

927
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:34,477
Hey, I forgot to show you this.

928
01:07:37,239 --> 01:07:38,552
What?

929
01:07:39,072 --> 01:07:42,407
Are you serious?
I knew Brooke was going to ruin him!

930
01:07:43,257 --> 01:07:45,171
Who is she?
What do you mean, ruin him?

931
01:07:45,331 --> 01:07:47,881
Just nothing okay.
Just forget it.

932
01:07:50,094 --> 01:07:52,703
- How could you hate her so much?
- I...

933
01:07:53,151 --> 01:07:55,024
I don't hate her.

934
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:59,493
- You don't like her very much either.
- Well, you know, tendinitis does happen.

935
01:07:59,933 --> 01:08:03,426
Yeah, but ...
I worked so hard with him.

936
01:08:03,473 --> 01:08:07,189
Well then, make sure Little Annie
shows everyone how it should be done.

937
01:08:07,589 --> 01:08:10,876
Hey, I have an idea.
Maybe you could ride Stormy.

938
01:08:11,682 --> 01:08:13,740
Stormy is a mule, Jordan.

939
01:08:14,514 --> 01:08:16,400
I thought you liked her.

940
01:08:16,985 --> 01:08:20,421
Him and I do but...
He's not a horse.

941
01:08:20,601 --> 01:08:22,441
You got that one right.

942
01:08:22,975 --> 01:08:25,135
Is that why you said he won't eat?

943
01:08:26,714 --> 01:08:28,394
- Did I say that?
- Yeah.

944
01:08:28,746 --> 01:08:30,154
He's not eating?

945
01:08:31,958 --> 01:08:34,659
You know what?  Jordan
and I have a lot of work to do.

946
01:08:34,728 --> 01:08:37,578
Back at uh...
our house.

947
01:08:52,049 --> 01:08:55,309
So, what do you think
your chances are?

948
01:08:56,635 --> 01:08:58,116
I don't know.

949
01:08:58,570 --> 01:09:00,563
Horse show is not
that far off, you know?

950
01:09:00,670 --> 01:09:03,330
I know that.
That's what worries me.

951
01:09:03,963 --> 01:09:07,090
Don't worry.
You'll be great.

952
01:09:07,763 --> 01:09:08,949
Thanks.

953
01:09:09,082 --> 01:09:11,708
But I kind of need more
than you just saying that.

954
01:09:13,170 --> 01:09:14,957
Maybe I can be more.

955
01:09:18,589 --> 01:09:20,078
Who's Brooke?

956
01:09:21,705 --> 01:09:25,032
Just the girl who ruin
my horse and my life.

957
01:09:26,379 --> 01:09:27,639
Oh,...

958
01:09:28,773 --> 01:09:30,306
glad I asked.

959
01:09:38,853 --> 01:09:40,109
Stupid mule.

960
01:09:48,065 --> 01:09:50,393
It's no use.
He won't eat.

961
01:09:52,125 --> 01:09:55,051
Doesn't mean we can't.
What do you want for supper?

962
01:09:55,848 --> 01:09:57,348
What have you got?

963
01:09:57,855 --> 01:09:59,562
A lot of vegetables.

964
01:09:59,755 --> 01:10:01,611
Anything good?

965
01:10:01,945 --> 01:10:03,818
And you ain't a vegetarian?

966
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:06,907
- No, I'm an American.
- Me too.

967
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:10,068
Alright, how about one of this?

968
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:11,641
Yeah.

969
01:10:12,951 --> 01:10:16,681
I've been trying to convert
the wrong ones. Set the table, here, son.

970
01:10:37,016 --> 01:10:39,199
He wanted to wait up for you.

971
01:10:40,986 --> 01:10:43,006
He didn't make it.

972
01:10:48,315 --> 01:10:49,745
You know,...

973
01:10:50,446 --> 01:10:52,152
he's all I have left.

974
01:10:53,919 --> 01:10:55,492
Other than you.

975
01:10:56,578 --> 01:10:59,379
He's...He's a good worker.

976
01:11:00,233 --> 01:11:02,940
So how's the training
going for Little Annie?

977
01:11:04,696 --> 01:11:06,177
Uh, it's good.

978
01:11:06,537 --> 01:11:09,344
Mere 10 days to the competition.

979
01:11:09,690 --> 01:11:10,791
Hmm.

980
01:11:13,278 --> 01:11:14,932
Who is Brooke?

981
01:11:17,806 --> 01:11:19,546
Umm.

982
01:11:20,348 --> 01:11:23,384
Her mom is the one
that bought Admiral.

983
01:11:25,181 --> 01:11:26,741
You don't like her.

984
01:11:27,908 --> 01:11:29,881
It's not that I don't like her. It...

985
01:11:30,241 --> 01:11:33,133
- She just...
- You blame her for your problems.

986
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:36,113
Okay, you know,
you have no right to say that.

987
01:11:36,326 --> 01:11:39,300
- Okay.
- It is my life.

988
01:11:40,929 --> 01:11:43,396
It's not your life
I was commenting on.

989
01:11:44,643 --> 01:11:46,563
It's the way you're living it.

990
01:12:00,858 --> 01:12:03,114
Maybe he forgot who you are.

991
01:12:03,421 --> 01:12:05,768
He didn't forget,
he's just mad.

992
01:12:06,584 --> 01:12:08,264
Do mules get mad?

993
01:12:08,471 --> 01:12:10,011
This one does.

994
01:12:12,589 --> 01:12:15,105
Nope, nope come on.

995
01:12:16,173 --> 01:12:18,236
Oh, Stormy.

996
01:12:20,275 --> 01:12:22,936
Sam, do me a favor.
Don't listen to her.

997
01:12:25,553 --> 01:12:27,473
You know, you should
keep your kids together.

998
01:12:27,553 --> 01:12:30,046
It's a little more
complicated than that.

999
01:12:30,446 --> 01:12:33,086
No, you need to think of someone
else beside yourself, Mitch.

1000
01:12:33,133 --> 01:12:34,623
You had a real hard time with that.

1001
01:12:34,669 --> 01:12:36,489
Even when we were kids, you were...

1002
01:12:36,796 --> 01:12:39,076
great at taking but lousy at giving.

1003
01:12:39,793 --> 01:12:41,149
Listen to me.

1004
01:12:41,650 --> 01:12:43,116
Alright?

1005
01:12:44,176 --> 01:12:46,936
Even if there was money,

1006
01:12:47,255 --> 01:12:49,612
if-if I told them about it,
they would...

1007
01:12:49,739 --> 01:12:52,978
they would add at least five years
to my sentence. You understand that?

1008
01:12:53,065 --> 01:12:54,625
Minimum!

1009
01:12:55,777 --> 01:12:57,543
Look, if you uh...

1010
01:12:57,843 --> 01:13:00,663
you don't do something,
you might even lose them both.

1011
01:13:03,713 --> 01:13:05,426
I've already lost them, Sam.

1012
01:13:05,566 --> 01:13:07,493
No, no, you just let them down.

1013
01:13:07,588 --> 01:13:08,621
You just...

1014
01:13:09,568 --> 01:13:12,457
Look, I really don't
have time for this, alright?

1015
01:13:12,514 --> 01:13:14,481
It's your choice,
little brother.

1016
01:13:26,451 --> 01:13:28,494
Good. Left leg, left leg.
You must cut in.

1017
01:13:29,481 --> 01:13:33,795
Terrific.  The leg. It's coming in,
coming in.  His leg. Good, good.

1018
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:36,746
Hey, you riding pretty
good there, little man.

1019
01:13:36,836 --> 01:13:37,906
Thanks.

1020
01:13:40,072 --> 01:13:41,086
Is Doc around?

1021
01:13:41,149 --> 01:13:45,026
Uh no.  He went into town
but he'll be back later.

1022
01:13:45,086 --> 01:13:46,176
Alright.
Just have him call.

1023
01:13:46,202 --> 01:13:48,802
Dad's flying to go look at some
new stock over at Grand Junction.

1024
01:13:48,842 --> 01:13:52,540
- He wanted the Doc to go with him.
- Do you have an airport around here?

1025
01:13:52,910 --> 01:13:56,005
Yeah, a small one.
My dad keeps his plane there.

1026
01:13:56,085 --> 01:13:59,282
Your dad has a plane?  Can I fly in it?

1027
01:13:59,328 --> 01:14:01,561
Hey, you don't just ask like that.

1028
01:14:01,688 --> 01:14:03,788
Yeah, you could probably
go with dad and Doc.

1029
01:14:03,861 --> 01:14:06,871
- Really?
- I don't think it's a good idea.

1030
01:14:06,917 --> 01:14:07,904
When?

1031
01:14:08,077 --> 01:14:11,284
- Tomorrow. Just remind him ok, Buddy?
- Yeah.

1032
01:14:12,123 --> 01:14:13,719
Thanks for stopping by.

1033
01:14:13,833 --> 01:14:15,413
Don't mention it.

1034
01:14:18,722 --> 01:14:20,599
Looks like there's a storm coming.

1035
01:14:24,328 --> 01:14:26,831
- Who said it was okay?
- Kevin did.

1036
01:14:26,931 --> 01:14:28,111
Hmm.

1037
01:14:28,791 --> 01:14:31,097
- You wanna go?
- Do I?

1038
01:14:31,151 --> 01:14:34,216
- I don't know. Do you?
- Yes, I do.

1039
01:14:47,184 --> 01:14:48,534
What?

1040
01:14:49,565 --> 01:14:51,574
Vanessa called.

1041
01:14:53,707 --> 01:14:55,994
- She wants more money?
- No.

1042
01:14:56,993 --> 01:14:58,410
Jordan.

1043
01:15:01,469 --> 01:15:03,645
- What did you tell her?
- Nothing.

1044
01:15:04,702 --> 01:15:07,162
Look, she still has legal custody.

1045
01:15:08,296 --> 01:15:11,838
And I asked Mitch if he has any
money offshore like she claims.

1046
01:15:13,463 --> 01:15:15,783
- What did he say?
- He didn't.

1047
01:15:17,029 --> 01:15:21,036
- But you think he does, don't you?
- It doesn't matter what I think.

1048
01:15:24,891 --> 01:15:26,973
He's been sentenced.

1049
01:15:30,519 --> 01:15:31,955
Nobody told me that.

1050
01:15:33,743 --> 01:15:35,370
How long?

1051
01:15:36,340 --> 01:15:37,519
Five to ten.

1052
01:15:37,579 --> 01:15:39,139
Years?

1053
01:15:49,345 --> 01:15:52,121
So, does this mean
we can't go tomorrow?

1054
01:15:54,242 --> 01:15:56,554
I think we can still make that work out.

1055
01:15:57,547 --> 01:15:59,248
Yeah!

1056
01:16:50,204 --> 01:16:54,985
- I hope they got out before this hit.
- Jordan said that they could fly over it.

1057
01:16:55,599 --> 01:16:57,326
Plane's missing.

1058
01:16:58,013 --> 01:17:00,473
The Sheriff got the Mayday
call about an hour ago.

1059
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:03,106
- I'm gonna go see if I can find them.
- Where?

1060
01:17:03,205 --> 01:17:07,189
Birchwood Springs.  He said to gather
as many people as you can to go search.

1061
01:17:07,349 --> 01:17:09,929
- I'll see who I can get.
- I'm coming with you.

1062
01:17:10,162 --> 01:17:12,558
You can't, I only have one horse.

1063
01:17:12,825 --> 01:17:14,572
What about Little Annie?

1064
01:17:14,741 --> 01:17:17,178
There's no way she'd
make it up that mountain.

1065
01:17:18,757 --> 01:17:20,286
Stormy.

1066
01:17:22,499 --> 01:17:26,148
From the last transmission there
in the Rogers Beau area here,

1067
01:17:26,355 --> 01:17:30,342
I think if we start at the base, we circle
both ways, we might just get lucky.

1068
01:17:30,437 --> 01:17:31,384
Okay.

1069
01:17:31,490 --> 01:17:33,686
Well, then let's meet on
the east side of the Beau.

1070
01:17:33,777 --> 01:17:37,137
Okay.  I'll set up base at
the Birch Springs campground.

1071
01:17:37,190 --> 01:17:39,226
Here, take this, use Channel 4.
Let's go.

1072
01:17:39,286 --> 01:17:41,480
- Good luck.
- We'll find them.

1073
01:17:43,983 --> 01:17:45,570
Come on, buddy.

1074
01:17:49,566 --> 01:17:50,553
Come on.

1075
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:52,733
Stormy, stop.

1076
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:55,767
What's the matter with you?
Come on.

1077
01:18:01,242 --> 01:18:02,702
Look.

1078
01:18:03,376 --> 01:18:04,662
I know...

1079
01:18:04,769 --> 01:18:07,356
I haven't been there for
you and I'm sorry.

1080
01:18:07,556 --> 01:18:09,216
Okay?
It was wrong.

1081
01:18:10,066 --> 01:18:12,483
But I really need you right now.

1082
01:18:13,003 --> 01:18:13,936
Okay?

1083
01:18:14,009 --> 01:18:15,769
Jordan and Uncle Sam,...

1084
01:18:16,730 --> 01:18:20,150
they're lost and
they might be hurt really bad.

1085
01:18:20,549 --> 01:18:23,055
And I can't do this without you, ok?

1086
01:18:23,943 --> 01:18:25,763
I really need you.

1087
01:18:26,323 --> 01:18:28,236
Please do it for me.

1088
01:18:29,349 --> 01:18:30,750
I love you.

1089
01:19:35,884 --> 01:19:37,212
Kevin?

1090
01:19:38,906 --> 01:19:40,706
Kevin, can you hear me?

1091
01:19:42,764 --> 01:19:45,010
Kevin? Sheriff?
Anyone?

1092
01:19:48,773 --> 01:19:51,023
God help me,
before it's too late.

1093
01:20:24,888 --> 01:20:26,288
Cameron?

1094
01:20:27,743 --> 01:20:31,392
- He can't hear you. He's unconscious.
- I'm not unconscious.

1095
01:20:31,607 --> 01:20:33,946
- Jordan?
- I'm just resting my eyes.

1096
01:20:34,266 --> 01:20:36,482
Yeah well, just rest them some more.

1097
01:20:37,769 --> 01:20:39,529
Uncle Sam, are you hurt?

1098
01:20:39,849 --> 01:20:41,902
Ah.
Don't worry about it.

1099
01:20:43,842 --> 01:20:45,969
We got to get these two
down the mountain right away.

1100
01:20:46,049 --> 01:20:47,356
I'm sorry.

1101
01:20:47,996 --> 01:20:49,349
I can't move my leg.

1102
01:20:49,459 --> 01:20:50,159
Okay.

1103
01:20:50,260 --> 01:20:52,086
Don't move it,
just lie back down.

1104
01:20:52,286 --> 01:20:53,520
What about you?

1105
01:20:54,690 --> 01:20:55,776
It's nothing.

1106
01:20:56,489 --> 01:20:58,016
That doesn't look like nothing.

1107
01:20:58,127 --> 01:20:59,816
Don't worry about it.
Come here.

1108
01:21:01,723 --> 01:21:04,116
I think that Cameron
is hemorrhaging internally.

1109
01:21:04,243 --> 01:21:06,766
He is going to die if we don't give
him some help.

1110
01:21:06,926 --> 01:21:09,888
- Is that thing working?
- No, all I'm getting is static.

1111
01:21:10,586 --> 01:21:12,482
I think the mountain's cutting reception.

1112
01:21:12,956 --> 01:21:14,662
Up there, Elk Ridge Summit.

1113
01:21:14,762 --> 01:21:16,839
When you raise them,
they'll know where it is.

1114
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:20,349
- But you...
- Just go.  I'll be here when you get back.

1115
01:21:25,322 --> 01:21:28,905
Alright buddy.
Hang in there, okay?

1116
01:21:39,045 --> 01:21:40,655
Just a little further, boy.

1117
01:21:44,420 --> 01:21:45,820
Sheriff?

1118
01:21:46,333 --> 01:21:48,533
Kevin?
Anyone?

1119
01:21:51,439 --> 01:21:53,336
They can't hear me.

1120
01:21:56,588 --> 01:21:57,835
Kevin?

1121
01:21:58,268 --> 01:22:00,428
Please, somebody answer me.

1122
01:22:00,548 --> 01:22:04,235
<i>Sheriff's down the other side,
but I hear you.  Where are you?</i>

1123
01:22:04,281 --> 01:22:07,984
Jody? Jody, it's me.
The plane's just below Elk Ridge Summit.

1124
01:22:08,111 --> 01:22:10,510
<i>Copy that. I'll send
Kevin and the search party.</i>

1125
01:22:10,564 --> 01:22:14,067
Please hurry.  Cameron Winslow has
internal injuries and he's bleeding in,

1126
01:22:14,141 --> 01:22:16,087
and Jordan and Uncle Sam
both have broken bones.

1127
01:22:16,167 --> 01:22:19,670
<i>Didn't get all that, but somebody will
be there in about an hour, maybe less.</i>

1128
01:22:19,710 --> 01:22:21,390
<i>You just get over the hill.
Down and out.</i>

1129
01:22:21,590 --> 01:22:23,305
Thank you.

1130
01:22:24,812 --> 01:22:26,426
They're coming.

1131
01:22:39,196 --> 01:22:41,506
- Any luck?
- Yeah, I got them.

1132
01:22:41,572 --> 01:22:44,577
- How long?
- About an hour.

1133
01:22:44,726 --> 01:22:48,349
Okay.  We need to tie these ropes
together, so Stormy can pull.

1134
01:22:48,831 --> 01:22:49,827
Wow.

1135
01:22:49,921 --> 01:22:51,781
Not bad for a one-armed man.

1136
01:22:52,048 --> 01:22:55,328
Yeah, well.
That's what all the girls say.

1137
01:22:55,610 --> 01:22:59,383
- Dani, it hurts.
- Okay, don't lean on it.

1138
01:23:00,870 --> 01:23:03,823
That is the ugliest
horse I've ever seen.

1139
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:06,946
Well, that horse is
going to save your life.

1140
01:23:09,313 --> 01:23:12,880
Come on, boy.  Put your
leg in there. There you go.

1141
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:14,649
One, two...

1142
01:23:14,703 --> 01:23:17,063
Ow! Ow!

1143
01:23:18,902 --> 01:23:22,016
Bring him over here.
We'll meet them down the mountain.

1144
01:23:38,230 --> 01:23:39,703
Good boy.

1145
01:23:43,109 --> 01:23:44,937
Good boy, Stormy.

1146
01:24:11,958 --> 01:24:13,905
Here he comes.

1147
01:24:16,030 --> 01:24:18,966
Hey! He's hurt pretty bad.

1148
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:21,787
How did I get here?

1149
01:24:21,845 --> 01:24:23,352
Stormy brought you.

1150
01:24:23,725 --> 01:24:25,492
That's not a horse.

1151
01:24:26,177 --> 01:24:27,560
Where are the others?

1152
01:24:27,853 --> 01:24:29,747
They couldn't make it through.

1153
01:24:32,102 --> 01:24:33,932
Well, we have to.

1154
01:24:34,009 --> 01:24:36,449
I'll put him on my horse
and ride behind you.

1155
01:24:36,776 --> 01:24:38,749
Just don't let him
bounce around too much.

1156
01:24:45,762 --> 01:24:47,464
I was wrong.

1157
01:24:48,182 --> 01:24:49,624
About what?

1158
01:24:50,084 --> 01:24:51,545
Mules.

1159
01:24:53,024 --> 01:24:56,372
Well, I think the mule
feels the same way.

1160
01:24:58,220 --> 01:24:59,232
Yeah.

1161
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:04,130
I'll be back as soon as I can.

1162
01:25:06,797 --> 01:25:09,960
The radios work better down below.
I'll call you.

1163
01:25:17,664 --> 01:25:19,657
You look worse than what you say.

1164
01:25:21,318 --> 01:25:22,911
I think I uh...

1165
01:25:23,041 --> 01:25:24,695
might have broken a rib.

1166
01:25:24,861 --> 01:25:27,041
Getting hard to catch my breathe.

1167
01:25:28,061 --> 01:25:29,595
Can you ride, if I carry Jordan?

1168
01:25:29,669 --> 01:25:31,789
No!  You take him.

1169
01:25:31,896 --> 01:25:34,582
I'll stay here. I'll be okay.
They'll be back up for me.

1170
01:25:37,405 --> 01:25:38,915
Stormy!

1171
01:25:40,361 --> 01:25:43,148
Dani.  No!  No!
Let him go!

1172
01:25:43,368 --> 01:25:44,928
Stormy!

1173
01:25:50,825 --> 01:25:55,012
- But the wolves are gonna get him.
- Dani let him go, ok.  He's on his own.

1174
01:25:55,342 --> 01:25:56,028
Look.

1175
01:25:56,088 --> 01:25:58,035
These wolves are everywhere, ok.
We...

1176
01:25:58,148 --> 01:26:00,518
It's going to be dark soon.
We need to build a fire.

1177
01:26:01,502 --> 01:26:03,784
Do you have any matches?

1178
01:26:04,564 --> 01:26:05,864
No.

1179
01:26:08,423 --> 01:26:11,093
I can make a fire without matches.

1180
01:26:17,703 --> 01:26:21,183
- You made a good fire, buddy.
- Thanks.

1181
01:26:24,196 --> 01:26:25,888
My leg hurts.

1182
01:26:26,228 --> 01:26:27,795
Alright, try not to move it.

1183
01:26:27,895 --> 01:26:29,865
What if the wolf comes?

1184
01:26:30,111 --> 01:26:32,771
Well, don't let him move it either.

1185
01:26:38,299 --> 01:26:40,303
The wolf's right there!

1186
01:26:50,177 --> 01:26:51,594
That worked.

1187
01:26:52,035 --> 01:26:54,181
Probably, won't work again though.

1188
01:26:54,466 --> 01:26:57,040
Just keep doing it.
At least it works for now.

1189
01:27:00,791 --> 01:27:02,144
- Uncle Sam?
- Huh?

1190
01:27:02,191 --> 01:27:03,505
You gotta stay awake.

1191
01:27:03,698 --> 01:27:05,148
Enough.

1192
01:27:05,747 --> 01:27:07,872
Dani, it's been a long day.

1193
01:27:14,364 --> 01:27:17,016
Stormy, where are you?

1194
01:27:23,329 --> 01:27:25,041
He's coming back.

1195
01:27:26,629 --> 01:27:28,102
Uncle Sam?

1196
01:27:46,964 --> 01:27:48,657
Uncle Sam!

1197
01:28:03,770 --> 01:28:05,290
Stay back!

1198
01:28:19,759 --> 01:28:21,249
Stormy!

1199
01:28:23,429 --> 01:28:25,016
You came back.

1200
01:28:28,981 --> 01:28:30,448
He brought me here.

1201
01:28:30,662 --> 01:28:33,128
He found me down below
and then took off again.

1202
01:28:33,234 --> 01:28:35,517
I figured he was trying
to tell me something.

1203
01:28:35,671 --> 01:28:37,385
Are you okay?

1204
01:28:37,952 --> 01:28:40,572
One time I wished
you'd shown up early...

1205
01:28:40,759 --> 01:28:42,426
and you're late.

1206
01:28:45,718 --> 01:28:49,285
As soon as I get him to
the Sheriff's camp, I'll be back.

1207
01:29:01,616 --> 01:29:04,452
- Are we there yet?
- Almost, buddy.

1208
01:29:04,686 --> 01:29:05,959
Hang on.

1209
01:29:08,353 --> 01:29:09,599
Ow!

1210
01:29:14,031 --> 01:29:17,275
Cameron's gonna make it.
Just came over the radio.

1211
01:29:17,564 --> 01:29:19,340
Will you be able to get back on your own?

1212
01:29:19,481 --> 01:29:21,834
Oh yeah, we'll-we'll be fine.

1213
01:29:22,275 --> 01:29:24,017
It's a great little mule.

1214
01:29:24,157 --> 01:29:25,690
You trained him?

1215
01:29:26,009 --> 01:29:27,036
Umm...

1216
01:29:27,151 --> 01:29:29,924
No, more like he trained me.

1217
01:29:32,298 --> 01:29:33,671
Thank you.

1218
01:29:37,637 --> 01:29:39,767
Let's go home, Stormy.

1219
01:29:43,293 --> 01:29:45,249
Thanks for helping me, bud.

1220
01:29:45,989 --> 01:29:48,403
Are you gonna fix up Stormy too?

1221
01:29:48,569 --> 01:29:49,866
I already did.

1222
01:29:50,344 --> 01:29:52,314
- You want to do me a favor?
- Yeah?

1223
01:29:52,340 --> 01:29:54,180
You want to get him and tie
him on the fence up there?

1224
01:29:54,220 --> 01:29:56,647
- Okay.
- Thanks.

1225
01:29:59,517 --> 01:30:01,167
Okay little girl.

1226
01:30:02,267 --> 01:30:03,980
You ready?

1227
01:30:05,074 --> 01:30:08,107
Okay, come on.
Come on.

1228
01:30:20,650 --> 01:30:24,564
- Did you tell 'em?
- Ah, no. I-I did not.

1229
01:30:25,599 --> 01:30:27,422
Now, we're gonna go
make some supper.

1230
01:30:27,582 --> 01:30:28,936
It's nice to meet you.

1231
01:30:30,549 --> 01:30:32,570
What's going on?

1232
01:30:33,676 --> 01:30:35,564
I heard about Admiral.

1233
01:30:36,724 --> 01:30:38,952
There's nothing we could have done.

1234
01:30:39,579 --> 01:30:41,359
Yeah, I know.

1235
01:30:41,883 --> 01:30:44,144
We worked so hard too.

1236
01:30:45,205 --> 01:30:46,425
Yeah.

1237
01:30:47,021 --> 01:30:49,694
Well, your new horse, she's beautiful.

1238
01:30:50,396 --> 01:30:52,978
Well, I trained her...

1239
01:30:54,952 --> 01:30:56,978
but I think you should ride her.

1240
01:30:58,210 --> 01:31:00,293
- Me?
- Yeah.

1241
01:31:00,449 --> 01:31:03,865
I already talked to the show committee and
they're fine with you riding in my place.

1242
01:31:03,979 --> 01:31:06,653
I think you got a real good
shot at winning that trophy.

1243
01:31:07,597 --> 01:31:10,605
- But why are you...?
- Because I've already got my mount.

1244
01:31:14,092 --> 01:31:15,523
A mule?

1245
01:31:15,708 --> 01:31:17,345
Yeah, I uh...

1246
01:31:17,593 --> 01:31:19,559
I'm going to be
a trainer from now on.

1247
01:31:19,798 --> 01:31:22,385
So do good.
I need the exposure.

1248
01:31:22,835 --> 01:31:24,817
I don't know what to say.

1249
01:31:25,977 --> 01:31:27,837
You don't need to say anything.

1250
01:31:28,623 --> 01:31:29,857
I do.

1251
01:31:35,507 --> 01:31:37,130
I'm really sorry,...

1252
01:31:38,044 --> 01:31:40,771
for the way that I treated you
the last few years.

1253
01:31:41,092 --> 01:31:42,166
I just...

1254
01:31:42,392 --> 01:31:45,255
It's about all
my problems on you and...

1255
01:31:45,655 --> 01:31:47,349
I'm really sorry.

1256
01:31:48,262 --> 01:31:52,028
I know that it isn't enough, but...

1257
01:31:52,755 --> 01:31:54,375
I hope it's a start.

1258
01:31:55,399 --> 01:31:58,353
This is the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for us.

1259
01:32:01,488 --> 01:32:05,112
Thank you, Dani.
From both of us.

1260
01:32:05,529 --> 01:32:07,885
Thanks for giving me a second chance.

1261
01:32:08,912 --> 01:32:10,025
Well,...

1262
01:32:10,365 --> 01:32:12,159
you better get going.

1263
01:32:16,402 --> 01:32:18,434
I won't forget this.

1264
01:32:26,571 --> 01:32:30,361
Go win it.  And don't forget
to tell who your trainer is.

1265
01:32:34,463 --> 01:32:35,556
Hey, hey, hey!

1266
01:32:35,689 --> 01:32:38,109
Don't break any of those,
only ones I got.

1267
01:32:38,223 --> 01:32:39,799
These are brand new.

1268
01:32:39,866 --> 01:32:42,240
Well, I didn't say
I used them a lot.

1269
01:32:43,046 --> 01:32:44,572
Funny how things change.

1270
01:32:44,785 --> 01:32:46,326
Hey, my birthday is coming.

1271
01:32:46,392 --> 01:32:47,805
Oh really?
When is it?

1272
01:32:47,881 --> 01:32:51,417
In a month.
I was maybe thinking I could...

1273
01:32:52,494 --> 01:32:54,271
Just hold that thought.

1274
01:32:56,449 --> 01:32:57,888
Hello?

1275
01:33:00,642 --> 01:33:01,702
What?

1276
01:33:01,795 --> 01:33:03,602
What?
You mean now?

1277
01:33:06,710 --> 01:33:07,858
Okay.

1278
01:33:09,016 --> 01:33:10,257
Who was that?

1279
01:33:10,430 --> 01:33:11,864
His mother.

1280
01:33:13,392 --> 01:33:14,718
She's umm...

1281
01:33:15,091 --> 01:33:18,244
She's coming for the boy.  She got
papers from the district court.

1282
01:33:18,536 --> 01:33:20,102
No!

1283
01:33:20,369 --> 01:33:22,839
Why don't you just tell her no?

1284
01:33:24,692 --> 01:33:26,625
Go help your brother pack.

1285
01:33:34,041 --> 01:33:35,727
Hey, somebody's here.

1286
01:33:35,881 --> 01:33:36,767
What?

1287
01:33:36,900 --> 01:33:39,221
She called from a block away?

1288
01:33:39,656 --> 01:33:40,429
Look it.

1289
01:33:40,503 --> 01:33:41,887
It's Jordan's mother.

1290
01:33:42,147 --> 01:33:43,614
See if you can get him on the phone.

1291
01:33:43,678 --> 01:33:45,320
Yeah, I will.

1292
01:33:47,993 --> 01:33:50,849
There's only one person
who can change her mind now.

1293
01:33:58,436 --> 01:34:02,339
I would like to get back to
civilization before the year ends.

1294
01:34:02,393 --> 01:34:04,183
You know what you're
doing to him, don't you?

1295
01:34:04,223 --> 01:34:06,931
Mitch?
I hope he's squirming.

1296
01:34:07,305 --> 01:34:08,625
Jordan.

1297
01:34:09,009 --> 01:34:10,872
That is not my fault.

1298
01:34:11,062 --> 01:34:12,029
If Mitch had just...

1299
01:34:12,062 --> 01:34:15,349
If Mitch had dumped you two years ago,
this wouldn't be a problem now, would it?

1300
01:34:16,397 --> 01:34:19,860
- No need to get nasty.
- Why not?  I'm talking to a pro.

1301
01:34:28,003 --> 01:34:29,886
Why are you doing this?

1302
01:34:30,798 --> 01:34:32,998
Because I can.

1303
01:34:39,595 --> 01:34:42,838
We'll get you back.
I promise.

1304
01:34:43,087 --> 01:34:46,774
I mean, what can you do?
What can anybody do?

1305
01:34:52,070 --> 01:34:54,441
So you're sure
you won't change your mind?

1306
01:34:55,060 --> 01:34:56,513
I would.

1307
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:58,393
For a price.

1308
01:34:59,113 --> 01:35:00,340
Wait!

1309
01:35:04,007 --> 01:35:05,795
This is Vanessa.

1310
01:35:06,235 --> 01:35:07,809
You sure?

1311
01:35:08,182 --> 01:35:10,055
You can verify that?

1312
01:35:10,922 --> 01:35:14,195
Oh, I'll be there.
But let's be perfectly clear on this.

1313
01:35:14,382 --> 01:35:16,796
9 AM tomorrow morning.

1314
01:35:17,228 --> 01:35:18,942
Oh, I'll take him.

1315
01:35:20,582 --> 01:35:21,795
 Fine.

1316
01:35:24,844 --> 01:35:27,578
- Sweetheart, get out.
- What?

1317
01:35:27,823 --> 01:35:29,974
Oh honey, you're not coming.

1318
01:35:30,941 --> 01:35:32,787
Come here, you.

1319
01:35:39,932 --> 01:35:41,435
Bye bye.

1320
01:35:49,147 --> 01:35:50,467
Oh!

1321
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:52,380
Wow!

1322
01:35:53,436 --> 01:35:55,819
Who-Who did you call?

1323
01:35:56,486 --> 01:35:58,179
Your father's lawyer.

1324
01:35:58,419 --> 01:35:59,932
What did he do?

1325
01:36:00,051 --> 01:36:02,161
Nothing, but uh...

1326
01:36:02,368 --> 01:36:06,081
your dad, he revealed some
hidden assets to the court.

1327
01:36:06,182 --> 01:36:09,017
He would sign them over to
the wicked witch of the west there.

1328
01:36:09,085 --> 01:36:10,058
Uh huh.

1329
01:36:11,177 --> 01:36:16,279
But in order for her to get the money,
she has to sign legal custody over to Sam.

1330
01:36:22,153 --> 01:36:24,413
Come on, it's not that big of a deal.

1331
01:36:24,519 --> 01:36:27,819
So there's something to
show you over here.  Come on.

1332
01:36:31,487 --> 01:36:34,555
Your father,
he did the right thing.

1333
01:36:35,270 --> 01:36:38,323
- But how did you...
- Well, he told me about his hidden assets.

1334
01:36:38,530 --> 01:36:40,546
Because she was right about that.

1335
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:43,700
But from the bail I get
Jordan away from her,

1336
01:36:43,799 --> 01:36:45,393
he had to give up
more than just money.

1337
01:36:45,442 --> 01:36:46,599
What?

1338
01:36:47,997 --> 01:36:50,449
They added three years
on to his sentence.

1339
01:36:51,943 --> 01:36:53,203
Oh.

1340
01:36:54,794 --> 01:36:56,802
So, I'm staying here?

1341
01:36:57,862 --> 01:36:58,976
Yeah.

1342
01:36:59,528 --> 01:37:01,215
You're staying here.

1343
01:37:02,759 --> 01:37:06,802
You know, I just remembered that
I do have something for your birthday.

1344
01:37:06,901 --> 01:37:08,636
His birthday is not for another month.

1345
01:37:08,701 --> 01:37:11,304
So who says you only get
presents on your birthday?

1346
01:37:12,825 --> 01:37:14,644
Cool!

1347
01:37:15,351 --> 01:37:16,277
Well, I uh...

1348
01:37:16,311 --> 01:37:18,821
- Look at that.
- Don't cut yourself.

1349
01:37:19,428 --> 01:37:22,914
And someone told me that
I'm a vet not a doctor.

1350
01:37:27,772 --> 01:37:29,943
- This is for you.
- Huh?

1351
01:37:30,490 --> 01:37:32,920
- Here.
- What?

1352
01:37:33,153 --> 01:37:34,740
It's not my birthday.

1353
01:37:34,807 --> 01:37:36,610
Oh, just open it.

1354
01:37:45,866 --> 01:37:46,999
I umm...

1355
01:37:47,179 --> 01:37:49,446
Look I would have gotten
down on one knee, but...

1356
01:37:49,499 --> 01:37:52,646
now then I'd have to get all
the way back up again and then...

1357
01:37:53,550 --> 01:37:55,540
So will you..?

1358
01:37:56,567 --> 01:37:58,160
Yes!

1359
01:38:06,521 --> 01:38:08,741
Hey, there's something
you guys should know.

1360
01:38:09,088 --> 01:38:09,927
What?

1361
01:38:09,993 --> 01:38:11,360
Little Annie won.

1362
01:38:12,583 --> 01:38:15,116
Looks like you're going to be
training horses from now on.

1363
01:38:15,176 --> 01:38:16,614
She won!

1364
01:38:19,599 --> 01:38:20,793
Umm.

1365
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:22,684
I'm sorry.

1366
01:38:23,538 --> 01:38:24,931
For what?

1367
01:38:25,693 --> 01:38:27,546
How I acted.

1368
01:38:28,273 --> 01:38:29,773
And I...

1369
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:31,820
I'd like to make it up to you.

1370
01:38:32,430 --> 01:38:35,133
- Oh really?
- Mm hm.
