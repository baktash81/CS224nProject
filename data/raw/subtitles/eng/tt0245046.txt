1
00:02:09,145 --> 00:02:13,275
<i>Looking back, it all seems so simple.</i>

2
00:02:14,584 --> 00:02:16,176
<i>We were at war.</i>

3
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:21,483
<i>The Nazis were the enemy. And because</i>
<i>good must triumph over evil...</i>

4
00:02:21,691 --> 00:02:24,922
<i>... so we would triumph over them.</i>

5
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:52,016
<i>How could we have known that war</i>
<i>never trades in such certainties?</i>

6
00:02:52,722 --> 00:02:55,714
<i>For where nothing is unthinkable...</i>

7
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:58,393
<i>... anything can be true.</i>

8
00:02:59,229 --> 00:03:01,220
<i>Even a lie.</i>

9
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,000
- Anvone sitting there?
- No.

10
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:16,778
For one dreadful moment<i>,</i> I thought
it was going to be standing room onlv.

11
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:21,944
It's all airmen and sappers down back.
Nice enough<i>,</i> but<i>...</i>

12
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:25,848
- Here<i>,</i> have one of mine.
- I'm all right<i>,</i> thanks.

13
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,856
Sorrv. Cannerlev.

14
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:33,755
- Richard Cannerlev. How do vou do?
- Charlotte Grav.

15
00:03:41,271 --> 00:03:44,707
So<i>,</i> going home or coming awav?

16
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:50,711
- I work in London.
- Don't tell me<i>,</i> let me guess.

17
00:03:50,914 --> 00:03:54,873
- You're in the WAAFs?
- I work in a surgerv.

18
00:03:56,619 --> 00:03:58,610
Good for vou.

19
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,550
Whv?

20
00:04:00,757 --> 00:04:05,023
- Risking London for the war effort.
- It's our dutv.

21
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:08,054
Absolutelv.

22
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:12,490
I'm a civil servant.
We don't come from anvwhere.

23
00:04:12,702 --> 00:04:16,536
The Germans are spreading the rumor
we're not born at all.

24
00:04:20,643 --> 00:04:22,201
You speak French?

25
00:04:22,378 --> 00:04:23,970
Oh<i>,</i> ves.

26
00:04:24,147 --> 00:04:25,512
Ever lived there?

27
00:04:25,715 --> 00:04:28,377
- I studied there.
- In Paris?

28
00:04:29,152 --> 00:04:33,452
Best citv in the world!
Not that vou'd want to live there now.

29
00:04:33,623 --> 00:04:37,423
It's full of Germans.
Can't find anvthing but sauerkraut.

30
00:04:37,593 --> 00:04:40,926
What the Germans have done
to France is not a joke.

31
00:04:41,097 --> 00:04:42,689
No.

32
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,292
Of course not.

33
00:05:14,864 --> 00:05:20,268
Clear the doors! Each bag
is to be collected bv the exit!

34
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,265
- Cheer up. We'll have a hoot.
- You'll have a hoot.

35
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:57,598
I'll be talking to some duffer
about Tennvson.

36
00:05:57,807 --> 00:06:00,708
- It's just a book launch.
- Books mean booze.

37
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,878
You should be in publishing.

38
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:06,310
Don't be such a stav-at-home.
You never go out.

39
00:06:06,516 --> 00:06:11,419
I don't care if thev're uglv<i>,</i>
as long as thev have nice teeth.

40
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,421
The author.

41
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,693
Excuse me.

42
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,198
- Sorrv.
- Oh<i>,</i> no.

43
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:04,265
- It's a bit noisv in there.
- Yes.

44
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,645
- Peter Gregorv.
- Charlotte Grav.

45
00:07:09,812 --> 00:07:11,074
Bloodv hell!

46
00:07:11,547 --> 00:07:14,175
These literarv girls...
Sorrv.

47
00:07:14,884 --> 00:07:18,513
Pilot Officer Borowski<i>,</i> Miss Grav.
He's a friend.

48
00:07:19,622 --> 00:07:22,386
Delighted to meet vou<i>,</i> Miss Grav.

49
00:07:24,327 --> 00:07:26,056
All clear.

50
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:30,855
So<i>...</i>

51
00:07:31,801 --> 00:07:33,564
You're from Scotland?

52
00:07:35,104 --> 00:07:36,901
- Whereabouts?
- Saint Andrews.

53
00:07:37,106 --> 00:07:40,269
Near Edinburgh<i>,</i> lovelv.
Bit different to this<i>,</i> eh?

54
00:07:40,476 --> 00:07:43,843
- You've never been to a <i>ceilidh.</i>
- I have<i>,</i> actuallv.

55
00:07:44,013 --> 00:07:47,813
And ves<i>,</i> it was noisv.

56
00:07:50,286 --> 00:07:54,450
Thev don't serve warm gin either.
I don't know how vou drink it.

57
00:07:54,624 --> 00:08:00,119
- At least I don't water plants with it.
- You weren't meant to see that.

58
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:07,900
Miss Grav! I thought it was vou.

59
00:08:08,104 --> 00:08:10,470
Good of vou to come.
How do vou do?

60
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,940
Let me introduce vou to some chums.
We're over in the corner.

61
00:08:16,646 --> 00:08:21,015
Morris<i>,</i> meet Miss Grav!
She reads Stendhal in French.

62
00:08:21,984 --> 00:08:25,943
It's one thing to order dinner
in the lingo. Quite another...

63
00:08:26,155 --> 00:08:28,680
...to pass vourself off as a waiter.

64
00:08:28,891 --> 00:08:33,328
We're alwavs looking for French
speakers. War work of some kind.

65
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:39,029
- Take me.
- You'd never pass the phvsical.

66
00:08:40,803 --> 00:08:43,795
Thev're trained<i>,</i> but the truth is...

67
00:08:43,973 --> 00:08:47,306
...vou're either fluent or vou're not.
- I suppose.

68
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:52,174
It's not easv pretending to be French.
It's not just knowing the words.

69
00:08:52,348 --> 00:08:54,316
One's got to want to do it.

70
00:08:54,517 --> 00:08:59,284
One's got to feel stronglv about
what the Nazis have done to France.

71
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:05,120
Excuse me.
I did give vou mv number<i>,</i> didn't I?

72
00:09:05,328 --> 00:09:09,287
- Yes.
- Do call<i>,</i> please.

73
00:09:18,407 --> 00:09:20,398
Bottoms up!

74
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,339
To war.

75
00:09:30,753 --> 00:09:32,380
Hello again.

76
00:09:32,888 --> 00:09:34,185
Hello.

77
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:53,999
Has that bloodv airman
been eating mv rations again?

78
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:56,201
And mine!

79
00:09:57,913 --> 00:09:59,676
Go on.

80
00:10:30,446 --> 00:10:33,176
That's terrible.
You're not even trving.

81
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:34,371
Punish me.

82
00:10:38,321 --> 00:10:40,414
I submit!

83
00:10:40,623 --> 00:10:44,184
The invasion plans
are in mv wooden leg.

84
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,343
You're here.

85
00:11:03,446 --> 00:11:04,845
I think so.

86
00:11:07,116 --> 00:11:09,778
What would vou sav
if I went to France?

87
00:11:09,985 --> 00:11:12,112
Whv? Has someone asked vou?

88
00:11:14,056 --> 00:11:15,523
What for?

89
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:18,783
To be some sort of agent
or courier<i>,</i> I think.

90
00:11:18,994 --> 00:11:21,963
- I'm not sure.
- It's far too dangerous.

91
00:11:22,164 --> 00:11:27,431
- You flv. That's dangerous.
- It's the onlv thing I'm good at.

92
00:11:28,871 --> 00:11:30,702
Do vou mind?

93
00:11:30,906 --> 00:11:34,967
You didn't even sav "ouch."
You're brave. Be proud of it.

94
00:11:35,177 --> 00:11:38,738
- I'm just scared of vou.
- I want to be brave...

95
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,381
...like vou are.

96
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,813
Just be vourself.

97
00:11:44,987 --> 00:11:48,684
If I was mvself<i>,</i> I'd never let vou go.

98
00:12:03,906 --> 00:12:09,173
Do vou believe in fate?
I don't mean fate exactlv<i>,</i> I mean...

99
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:14,978
...if someone tells vou... If vou have
a gift<i>,</i> it's vour dutv to use it.

100
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:17,776
To go out there. To...

101
00:12:18,921 --> 00:12:22,288
...to be brave.
- Charlotte...

102
00:12:24,593 --> 00:12:26,891
...l'm not brave.

103
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:30,089
It's just that...

104
00:12:31,801 --> 00:12:35,737
...war makes us into people
we didn't know we were.

105
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,363
Look.

106
00:12:40,075 --> 00:12:44,603
I've lost all mv friends.
Everv single one.

107
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:52,213
Do vou think I feel brave
when I'm alive and thev're dead?

108
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,756
It's not braverv...

109
00:12:59,428 --> 00:13:01,623
...it's accident.

110
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:06,060
Mv leave is up.

111
00:13:11,507 --> 00:13:12,667
When?

112
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,467
Tomorrow.

113
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:20,280
It's just some ops over France.
It's<i>...</i>

114
00:13:21,183 --> 00:13:23,048
How long?

115
00:13:23,786 --> 00:13:25,549
Three weeks.

116
00:13:28,858 --> 00:13:31,418
I'll be back in London on the 18th.

117
00:13:32,962 --> 00:13:35,021
You'll wait for me here.

118
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,898
<i>- War.</i>
<i>- Peace.</i>

119
00:13:40,102 --> 00:13:42,730
- War.
- Flowers.

120
00:13:42,938 --> 00:13:44,530
France.

121
00:13:48,177 --> 00:13:50,304
Eves closed<i>,</i> please.

122
00:13:50,513 --> 00:13:52,708

- IKev.

124
00:13:54,817 --> 00:13:55,977

125
00:13:56,185 --> 00:13:57,174
- Death.
- Old.

126
00:13:57,386 --> 00:13:58,375
Man.

127
00:14:00,723 --> 00:14:01,849
One word onlv.

128
00:14:02,725 --> 00:14:04,317
- Man.
- Bald.

129
00:14:04,827 --> 00:14:08,354
- Man.
- Bald. Sorrv.

130
00:14:08,864 --> 00:14:12,800
Speed it up! Come on!
Good!

131
00:14:13,002 --> 00:14:16,768
Small steps!
Remember what vour mother told vou!

132
00:14:17,239 --> 00:14:19,503
IKeep vour knees and legs together!

133
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:24,042
France<i>,</i> as vou know<i>,</i>
is currentlv divided into two zones.

134
00:14:24,246 --> 00:14:28,979
The northern zone<i>,</i> including Paris<i>,</i>
is occupied bv the Germans.

135
00:14:29,151 --> 00:14:30,379
The southern zone...

136
00:14:30,586 --> 00:14:35,523
...or "free zone" is occupied
and run bv the French out of Vichv.

137
00:14:36,592 --> 00:14:39,652
Bv collaborating fullv
with the Third Reich...

138
00:14:39,862 --> 00:14:43,127
...the Vichv government
is allowed to police itself.

139
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:48,134
And it's here in the free zone
that the main Resistance is located.

140
00:14:48,337 --> 00:14:52,706
For those selected few who pass<i>,</i>
this is where vou will work.

141
00:14:53,542 --> 00:14:57,740
<i>Once behind enemy lines,</i>
<i>treat everyone with suspicion.</i>

142
00:14:57,947 --> 00:15:02,179
<i>The shopkeeper, the police,</i>
<i>even colleagues in the Resistance.</i>

143
00:15:02,384 --> 00:15:06,445
"Looking forward to our next meeting.
Manv thanks."

144
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:10,386
As long as vou are transmitting<i>,</i>
the Hun can hear vou...

145
00:15:10,593 --> 00:15:13,153
...so save the bloodv chitchat.

146
00:15:14,096 --> 00:15:17,088
Right foot! Again<i>,</i> right foot!

147
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:21,599
Chest! Left shoulder! Right eve!

148
00:15:21,804 --> 00:15:24,773
The securitv implications
are prettv simple.

149
00:15:25,207 --> 00:15:27,607
Should vou be caught and tortured...

150
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:31,940
...vours<i>,</i> we sincerelv trust<i>,</i> will be
the onlv name thev know.

151
00:15:32,548 --> 00:15:36,678
<i>It follows that your greatest</i>
<i>protection will be your cover.</i>

152
00:15:36,885 --> 00:15:41,413
<i>Soon, you'll transform</i>
<i>yourself from who you are now...</i>

153
00:15:41,624 --> 00:15:45,720
<i>... into somebody entirely different.</i>

154
00:15:48,564 --> 00:15:50,293
Please<i>,</i> Mommv<i>,</i> I'm fine.

155
00:15:50,499 --> 00:15:54,458
If a bomb's got mv name on it<i>,</i>
a bomb's got mv name on it.

156
00:15:54,803 --> 00:15:57,067
- I'm back.
- I'm not leaving London.

157
00:15:57,272 --> 00:16:00,833
- Oh<i>,</i> Charlotte<i>,</i> hello.
- Bve.

158
00:16:07,082 --> 00:16:10,643
- What's this course vou've been on?
- FANYs. First Aid...

159
00:16:10,853 --> 00:16:13,617
I know what thev are.
Are vou a driver?

160
00:16:13,822 --> 00:16:15,881
Oh<i>,</i> I expect so<i>,</i> ves.

161
00:16:16,091 --> 00:16:18,651
So whv do vou need to go on a course?

162
00:16:18,861 --> 00:16:23,298
I'm not reallv supposed to sav.
You never know who's listening.

163
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,098
Liar.

164
00:16:34,643 --> 00:16:36,975
You can't drive.

165
00:16:40,683 --> 00:16:41,843
Got me.

166
00:17:05,641 --> 00:17:08,007
- Pilot Officer Borowski?
<i>- Yes.</i>

167
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:12,010
- It's Miss Grav. We met at the partv.
<i>- Oh, Miss Gray.</i>

168
00:17:12,214 --> 00:17:17,083
Yes<i>,</i> I'm looking for Peter.
I was expecting to see him last night.

169
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:21,518
<i>Oh, right. Peter, yes.</i>

170
00:17:23,692 --> 00:17:26,160
<i>Look, sorry.</i>

171
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:30,288
<i>We think he went down over France.</i>

172
00:17:32,701 --> 00:17:36,467
<i>But don't give up hope.</i>
<i>You know Peter, he's a fighter.</i>

173
00:17:38,907 --> 00:17:41,740
<i>We should know more in a few days.</i>

174
00:17:43,011 --> 00:17:45,172
<i>Can you call me back?</i>

175
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,750
<i>Miss Gray, are you all right?</i>

176
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:54,582
<i>Why is your name down for France?</i>
<i>Only one in three come back.</i>

177
00:17:55,023 --> 00:17:57,184
I want to help win the war.

178
00:17:57,392 --> 00:18:00,555
And being a courier
in France is glamorous?

179
00:18:00,763 --> 00:18:04,824
- I'd be prettv sillv to think that.
- A lot of women do.

180
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,491
Is there something wrong with that?

181
00:18:08,804 --> 00:18:12,262
Your father fought in the Great War<i>,</i>
is that right?

182
00:18:14,376 --> 00:18:17,709
Would vou sav
vou're trving to impress him?

183
00:18:17,913 --> 00:18:19,380
Whv should I?

184

...vou're asking questions
when vou know the answers.

188
00:18:32,928 --> 00:18:36,091
Do vou find it easv
to form attachments?

189
00:18:36,298 --> 00:18:39,495
- On average.
- Have vou ever been in love?

190
00:18:41,837 --> 00:18:43,600

191
00:18:43,806 --> 00:18:47,503

Faith<i>,</i> hope or love?

00:18:53,649 --> 00:18:54,877
Hope.

194
00:19:00,856 --> 00:19:03,984

00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:16,060
Come on<i>,</i> ladies!
This is the finish line!

198
00:19:17,973 --> 00:19:21,966
<i>- Miss Gray? I've got news of Peter.</i>
- You have?

199
00:19:22,177 --> 00:19:25,203
<i>They made radio contact last night.</i>

200
00:19:25,814 --> 00:19:27,748

<i>You have no children,</i>

238
00:22:10,812 --> 00:22:13,280
<i>You simply want to survive the war.</i>

This is the contact point.

272
00:25:41,223 --> 00:25:43,623

- You'd given them to her?

339
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,388
And?

340
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:10,689
Thev asked her what thev
were for and took her awav.

341
00:34:10,898 --> 00:34:12,763
- Thev didn't ask for vou?
- No.

342
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:16,926
- What will thev do with her?
- Who saw vou together?

343
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:21,006
- The barman spoke to me.
- He's all right. Anvone else?

344
00:34:21,175 --> 00:34:24,576
I don't know.
It all happened verv fast.

00:34:25,713 --> 00:34:28,238
- How was she caught?
- Thev followed her.

346
00:34:28,449 --> 00:34:30,940
And she came into the cafe?

347
00:34:33,855 --> 00:34:36,050
She was trving to warn me.

348
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,584
That takes a second.

349
00:34:40,094 --> 00:34:42,654
We talked for a moment.

350
00:34:43,364 --> 00:34:45,457
She shouldn't have come in.

351
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:49,500
- She was worried thev'd trv to stop me.
- You don't...

- What will thev do to her?
- I don't know.

00:35:10,658 --> 00:35:13,126
Whv not go to vour English contact?

00:35:13,327 --> 00:35:15,454
Because he hasn't shown up vet.

357

- You have a code for meeting?
- Yes!

358

I'm sorrv. I should go.

359
00:35:22,103 --> 00:35:23,468
No<i>,</i> no!

360
00:35:24,405 --> 00:35:28,102
Wait. You need a new cover.

361
00:35:39,487 --> 00:35:43,184
Mv father lives outside Lezignac<i>,</i>
he rents rooms.

362
00:35:43,357 --> 00:35:47,123
If anvone asks<i>,</i> sav
vou're a friend of mine from Paris.

Two Jewish bovs are there.
Their parents are missing. You help.

369

373
00:37:04,505 --> 00:37:06,803

374
00:37:08,175 --> 00:37:11,838
- Your son...
- I know. He told me. I'm Levade.

You can start bv giving the
bovs a bath. Thev stink.

380
00:38:14,976 --> 00:38:16,671
Shh! Hide!

381
00:38:25,653 --> 00:38:27,280
I'm Dominique.

382
00:38:27,488 --> 00:38:31,754
I work for Monsieur Levade.
He asked me to give vou a bath.

383
00:38:50,845 --> 00:38:52,642
So would vou like me to...?

384
00:39:06,994 --> 00:39:09,019
I'll wait outside.

385
00:39:21,642 --> 00:39:25,669
- She's the skv ladv. I know it.
- What's she doing here?

386
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,939
Housework.

387
00:39:32,586 --> 00:39:34,952
What happened to vour towels?

388
00:39:35,156 --> 00:39:36,384
We're going home!

389
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:39,457
No<i>,</i> wait<i>,</i> please.

00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:42,993
You're soaked. Here.
Drv vourselves.

391
00:39:43,197 --> 00:39:46,826
We're going home.
Monsieur Levade isn't nice.

392
00:39:47,034 --> 00:39:50,333
- I don't like him either.
- I'm sure he's...

393
00:39:50,538 --> 00:39:53,200
Where are our parents?

394
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:59,676
I'm sure thev wouldn't want vou
getting cold. Would thev?

395
00:39:59,847 --> 00:40:01,815
Here vou go.

396
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,075
The bovs are all right?

397
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:38,014
Thev're in bed.

398
00:40:38,886 --> 00:40:43,789
Thev were asking about their mother.
Have vou found out what happened?

399
00:40:43,991 --> 00:40:47,984
Thev were arrested
vesterdav evening bv our police.

400
00:40:51,332 --> 00:40:55,496
Thev've been taken to a
holding camp in Drancv.

401
00:40:55,703 --> 00:41:00,402
The reason the bovs weren't picked
up is because thev'd sneaked out.

402
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:04,641
I have a contact there.
He's working on their release.

403
00:41:04,845 --> 00:41:06,779
The mother must be going mad.

404
00:41:06,981 --> 00:41:11,281
- It was a mistake to bring them here.
- You<i>,</i> with no room to spare.

405
00:41:11,452 --> 00:41:15,183
- No room good enough for vou.
- He's not used to visitors.

406
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:18,722
- I have a choice?
- Please<i>,</i> sit.

407
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:22,190
- Sit!
- Thank vou.

408
00:41:34,175 --> 00:41:37,474
I know Monsieur Duguav.
He lectured in Toulouse.

409
00:41:37,678 --> 00:41:40,511
I did some work for the universitv.

410
00:41:45,152 --> 00:41:46,881
Thev're good bovs.

411
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:48,987

- Do vou like rabbit stew?
- Verv nice.

414
00:41:54,995 --> 00:41:58,362
She likes it<i>,</i>
and she hasn't even tried it.

415
00:41:58,566 --> 00:42:01,160
He thinks I cook like shit.

416
00:42:05,706 --> 00:42:08,231
If vou hear from vour contact<i>,</i>
tell me.

417
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:10,034
Of course.

418
00:42:12,246 --> 00:42:15,511
I'll sav good night to the bovs
before I go.

419
00:42:35,102 --> 00:42:37,400
You mav serve now.

420
00:43:28,389 --> 00:43:32,416
- Excuse me<i>,</i> am I on the right...?
- Don't tell me vour name.

421
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,656
- I wasn't...
- Twelve weeks of training.

422
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:38,764
First thing thev do
is tell me their names.

423
00:43:38,966 --> 00:43:41,127
Let's get this done quicklv.

424
00:43:41,335 --> 00:43:45,863
The Germans use the main line
to transport munitions and vehicles.

425
00:43:46,073 --> 00:43:49,167
There's a train through Lezignac
Mondav<i>,</i> 1:30.

426
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:53,904
Mainlv wagons<i>,</i> bolsters for
tanks and artillerv pieces. Got that?

427
00:43:54,114 --> 00:43:58,050
Right.
So I pass that on to Octave.

428
00:43:58,252 --> 00:44:01,653
Who do vou think vou pass it to?
The <i>gendarmerie</i>?

429
00:44:01,855 --> 00:44:04,449
I was just... Sorrv.

430
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:11,221
I met a contact in town<i>,</i> code name
Francoise. She's been taken awav.

431
00:44:12,166 --> 00:44:16,102
- Do vou know what's happened to her?
- She's dead.

432
00:44:17,438 --> 00:44:19,872
Matter of fact<i>,</i>
I liked her verv much.

433
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:22,440
She was unluckv. You weren't.

434
00:44:22,643 --> 00:44:25,976
Anvwav<i>,</i> can't afford to get too close.

435
00:44:41,328 --> 00:44:43,125
Now!

436
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:55,199
Go!

437
00:44:59,012 --> 00:45:02,948
Auguste<i>,</i> is Claire still mad enough
to marrv a blind man?

438
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:05,380
Mv glasses are mv best feature.

439
00:45:05,586 --> 00:45:08,612
- Don't be too proud.
- Onlv from the neck up.

440
00:45:08,822 --> 00:45:10,790
Liar.

441
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:16,392
- Time?
- Two minutes.

442
00:45:25,706 --> 00:45:29,403
- Readv?
- Just two seconds.

443
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:36,510
Yes!

444
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:49,595
Let's go!

445
00:46:32,306 --> 00:46:33,398
Down!

446
00:47:02,603 --> 00:47:04,468
- Guards firing!
- Swine!

447
00:47:04,671 --> 00:47:06,138
- Gerard<i>,</i> no!
- Gerard!

448
00:47:07,641 --> 00:47:08,801

449
00:47:29,796 --> 00:47:32,321
Come on! Move!

450
00:47:32,533 --> 00:47:34,160
Come on! Let's go!

451
00:47:39,139 --> 00:47:40,970
You go with him.

452
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:43,367

453
00:48:05,999 --> 00:48:07,967

454
00:48:26,253 --> 00:48:27,880
Thank vou.

455
00:48:28,855 --> 00:48:30,686
What vou've just done<i>...</i>

456
00:48:34,695 --> 00:48:36,663
Your hands.

457
00:48:39,066 --> 00:48:42,035
It's alwavs a shock the first time.

458
00:48:42,302 --> 00:48:46,033
I tell Julien
he'll die fighting the Germans.

459
00:48:47,608 --> 00:48:50,099
The old men<i>,</i> we remember.

460
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:52,540
- You fought in...
- I was an engineer.

461
00:48:52,779 --> 00:48:54,804
The war loves engineers.

462
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:58,075
We mend dead machines.

463
00:49:01,121 --> 00:49:03,521
So Julien savs vou're from Paris.

464
00:49:06,426 --> 00:49:08,223
Your husband?

465
00:49:08,428 --> 00:49:11,090
He's a prisoner of war. In Bonn.

466
00:49:12,332 --> 00:49:13,822
Sorrv.

467
00:49:22,976 --> 00:49:25,877
Whv doesn't vour son live with vou?

468
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:28,036
You don't get on?

469
00:49:29,116 --> 00:49:31,744
Mv son's a Communist.

470
00:49:34,821 --> 00:49:37,551
- And vou?
- I'm not interested in politics.

471

For someone thev love.

475

Does it matter?

476
00:49:54,708 --> 00:49:57,370
Depends if vou're on our side.

00:49:59,212 --> 00:50:00,474

00:50:01,648 --> 00:50:04,310

00:51:30,637 --> 00:51:34,539
- We didn't know where vou were.
- Look<i>,</i> I'm sorrv.

You have to stav at the Domaine.

00:51:39,312 --> 00:51:41,542
It's verv important.

Get down! You're dead!
The longest throw wins!

492

What did Vichv expect? The Germans

504
00:52:55,355 --> 00:52:57,619
You should be proud.

505
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:01,618

509
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:17,800
Do vou have news of their parents?

510
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:20,143
Nothing vet.

511
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:29,479
These were mv onlv clean clothes.

512
00:53:33,393 --> 00:53:36,385
- The bovs seem well.
- Thev do!

513
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:46,064

514
00:53:46,373 --> 00:53:47,738
Good.

515
00:53:51,578 --> 00:53:53,944
You did well last night.

516
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:03,255
I should be Essential Services.

517
00:54:04,624 --> 00:54:09,687
I had a companv in Birmingham.
Supplied parts for Ford.

518
00:54:10,597 --> 00:54:12,861
Fucking war!

519
00:54:14,401 --> 00:54:16,699
Do vou have something for me?

520
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:20,003
God<i>,</i> I hate this place.

521
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:23,466
You have no idea.

522
00:54:26,112 --> 00:54:30,276
There's a drop coming. Tomorrow night.

523
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:35,346
These are the reference points.
Pass them on to vour frogs.

524
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,089
I know places that's a square meal.

525
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:45,626
I need to<i>...</i>
I need to ask a favor.

526
00:54:46,132 --> 00:54:50,466
- Ask.
- I need to contact a colleague.

527
00:54:51,137 --> 00:54:55,096
I think he's hiding
in a safe house in Gillesse.

528
00:54:55,308 --> 00:54:58,368
Your friend's name? What is it?

529
00:54:58,578 --> 00:54:59,875
Peter Gregorv.

530
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:04,346
- He's a pilot. His plane...
- I'll make inquiries.

531
00:55:06,252 --> 00:55:11,315
- It's verv important.
- I said<i>,</i> I'd make inquiries.

532
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:41,144
No!

533
00:55:41,354 --> 00:55:43,288
Don't!

534
00:55:48,995 --> 00:55:51,555
Leave me alone!

535
00:55:53,366 --> 00:55:56,233
- Go awav!
- You're all right.

536
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:58,370
You're all right now.

537
00:55:58,571 --> 00:56:02,803
You're just dreaming. It's a dream.

538
00:56:08,014 --> 00:56:12,974
Jacob thinks vou're an angel because
vou fell out of the skv. Is it true?

539
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:15,619
No.

540
00:56:19,859 --> 00:56:22,419
- Is it all mv fault?
- What?

541
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:26,190
- That Mama and Papa went awav.
- No.

542
00:56:26,399 --> 00:56:29,732
No<i>,</i> it's not vour fault at all.
It's the war.

543
00:56:29,936 --> 00:56:34,635
- Will thev be all right?
- Yes<i>,</i> thev're going to be fine.

544
00:57:48,815 --> 00:57:52,842

Julien!

556
00:58:29,355 --> 00:58:31,084
We have to go!

557
00:58:32,659 --> 00:58:34,217
Shut up!

558
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:38,364
Robert Daladier<i>,</i> disap...

559
00:58:50,810 --> 00:58:53,278
We have to go<i>,</i> do vou understand?

560
00:59:37,290 --> 00:59:40,726
- We got news of the bovs' parents.
- Good?

561
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:43,054
Thev've been moved to Poland.

562
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:46,530
What...? To another work camp?

563
00:59:46,699 --> 00:59:48,530
I don't know.

564
00:59:53,339 --> 00:59:57,935
- I'm sorrv vou had to come out to me.
- I work for vour father.

565
00:59:58,111 --> 01:00:00,409
We're bound to know each other.

566
01:00:10,957 --> 01:00:14,859
- What'll we tell the bovs?
- Nothing<i>,</i> vet.

567
01:00:25,305 --> 01:00:28,832
I spoke to one of the <i>gendarmes</i>
who took them awav.

568
01:00:29,676 --> 01:00:32,873
He said he'd let the mother
write a note<i>,</i> but...

569
01:00:34,314 --> 01:00:37,977
...she took too long.
He had to go.

570
01:00:38,351 --> 01:00:41,843
- The note was lost in the rush.
- Oh<i>,</i> God.

571
01:00:46,659 --> 01:00:48,559
You spoke to vour contact?

572
01:00:48,761 --> 01:00:50,922
- Yes.
- And?

573
01:00:51,097 --> 01:00:54,726
- Drop's confirmed.
- I'll meet vou at the crossroads at 7.

574
01:01:01,473 --> 01:01:04,738
I found this pushed
under the front door. For vou.

575
01:01:04,943 --> 01:01:06,570
Thank vou.

576
01:01:12,050 --> 01:01:14,109
- Good news?
- Mavbe.

577
01:01:14,586 --> 01:01:16,349
I don't know.

578
01:01:18,356 --> 01:01:20,290
I have to go out.

579
01:01:20,492 --> 01:01:23,893
Tell Julien<i>,</i> if he calls<i>,</i>
I'll meet him.

580
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:27,496
- I'll be as quick as I can.
- Don't forget curfew!

581
01:01:49,554 --> 01:01:51,613
Papa<i>,</i> come on<i>,</i> quick.

582
01:02:11,743 --> 01:02:13,608
Bve<i>,</i> Mama.

583
01:03:15,674 --> 01:03:16,971

01:03:40,265 --> 01:03:43,792
Shit! Bloodv bike!

585
01:03:44,369 --> 01:03:46,462
Need to pee!

586
01:03:48,573 --> 01:03:50,632
Jesus!

587
01:03:53,044 --> 01:03:58,004
God<i>,</i> that is good!
Oh<i>,</i> God<i>,</i> that is so good!

588
01:04:21,539 --> 01:04:23,837
His aircraft.

589
01:04:26,711 --> 01:04:28,008
What...?

590
01:04:42,594 --> 01:04:46,223
- Where's Julien?
- He should be here bv now.

591
01:04:48,199 --> 01:04:50,565
Reverse L<i>,</i> quicklv!

592
01:04:56,608 --> 01:04:59,270

593
01:05:04,349 --> 01:05:05,907
On!

594
01:06:46,251 --> 01:06:49,448
His papers were found near the bodv.

595
01:06:56,961 --> 01:07:01,591
I shouldn't be here.
I should be in Birmingham.

596
01:07:02,867 --> 01:07:05,358
This isn't me.

597
01:07:21,219 --> 01:07:24,086
A few davs<i>,</i> vou'll be home<i>,</i> love.

598
01:07:29,494 --> 01:07:32,019
You don't want to stav here.

599
01:07:33,231 --> 01:07:38,362
People are betraving their neighbors
to the Gestapo for being too noisv.

600
01:07:40,104 --> 01:07:42,572
Nobodv's ordinarv now.

601
01:07:48,379 --> 01:07:51,780
I'll make contact
before vour plane comes.

602
01:07:52,850 --> 01:07:55,683
Don't go out unless vou have to.

603
01:09:04,422 --> 01:09:07,050
Dominique<i>,</i> I'm hungrv.

604
01:09:18,569 --> 01:09:20,730
Plates<i>,</i> please<i>,</i> Andre.

605
01:09:32,050 --> 01:09:35,542
- There's no jam. I want jam.
- This isn't a hotel.

606
01:09:35,753 --> 01:09:39,951
- Mama alwavs has jam.
- I am not vour bloodv mama!

607
01:09:46,864 --> 01:09:48,627
Eat up!

608
01:09:51,636 --> 01:09:53,126
Come.

609
01:10:01,646 --> 01:10:05,946
- I shouldn't have frightened them.
- Thev'll get over it.

610
01:10:06,150 --> 01:10:10,177
But what'll I sav?
How will thev ever trust me again?

611
01:10:10,388 --> 01:10:14,916
Thev will.
Children can forgive almost anvthing.

612
01:10:25,903 --> 01:10:30,363
- Well<i>,</i> whv can't Julien forgive vou?
- Do vou think he's so angrv?

613
01:10:32,243 --> 01:10:37,306
It's just sad<i>,</i> the wav the past
holds on to vou.

614
01:10:37,515 --> 01:10:42,680
Mv son's angrv because I'm all he's
got. His mother died when he was 3.

615
01:10:42,887 --> 01:10:44,650
I was a shittv father.

616
01:10:44,856 --> 01:10:49,225
Too interested in work. Girls.

617
01:10:49,961 --> 01:10:51,223
And now?

618
01:10:51,395 --> 01:10:54,489
I'm too old for self-deception.
I am what I am.

619
01:10:54,999 --> 01:11:00,733
Mv onlv shame is<i>,</i> I lived long enough
to see mv countrv betrav itself.

620
01:11:11,883 --> 01:11:13,646
Julien!

621
01:11:14,785 --> 01:11:16,810
Take the bovs inside!

622
01:11:17,021 --> 01:11:18,886
Come<i>,</i> quick!

623
01:11:20,091 --> 01:11:22,924
- What are vou doing? Let go!
- You told them!

624
01:11:23,094 --> 01:11:25,562
You told the Germans we were coming!

625
01:11:25,763 --> 01:11:27,958
- I swear...
- You told them!

626
01:11:28,166 --> 01:11:30,464
- I told no one!
- Shut up!

627
01:11:30,668 --> 01:11:35,002
- Let go of me!
- I wasn't even there to warn them.

628
01:11:35,206 --> 01:11:38,573
- I was late waiting for vou to come.
- I'm sorrv.

629
01:11:38,776 --> 01:11:43,213
You know how manv thev shot?
Auguste. Claire. All of them!

630
01:11:43,414 --> 01:11:48,613
There was nothing I could do!
I couldn't call out. The Germans<i>...</i>

631
01:11:49,153 --> 01:11:52,418
I just watched! I just watched!

632
01:11:52,623 --> 01:11:54,955
I couldn't<i>...</i>

633
01:11:56,294 --> 01:11:58,057
Where were vou?

634
01:11:58,996 --> 01:12:05,458
I had to report to mv contact.
I didn't have time to tell vou.

635
01:12:05,670 --> 01:12:07,865
I swear I spoke to no one.

636
01:12:08,072 --> 01:12:11,371
The onlv person who knew
the coordinates was vou.

637
01:12:17,715 --> 01:12:19,580
I swear.

638
01:12:27,091 --> 01:12:28,820
Well<i>,</i> somebodv told them.

639
01:12:29,026 --> 01:12:32,826
Thev knew the exact location.
Which field<i>,</i> which road.

640
01:12:33,030 --> 01:12:35,999
Thev had map references
down to the last tree.

641
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:40,432
She's telling the truth.
She was called awav. I saw the note.

642
01:12:40,638 --> 01:12:42,333
She wouldn't do that.

643
01:13:24,515 --> 01:13:26,506
Face the wall.

644
01:13:29,253 --> 01:13:31,483
- These are vour papers?
- Yes.

645
01:13:31,689 --> 01:13:36,683
This card shows vou crossed the
demarcation line illegallv last vear.

646
01:13:36,894 --> 01:13:40,057
The stamp is wrong.
In the car<i>,</i> please.

647
01:13:42,366 --> 01:13:46,496
As a teacher<i>,</i> I see evervone.
Children<i>,</i> parents<i>,</i> grandparents.

648
01:13:46,704 --> 01:13:49,036
There's nobodv I don't know.

649
01:13:51,242 --> 01:13:52,937
Here.

650
01:13:57,315 --> 01:13:59,078
We need to talk.

651
01:13:59,650 --> 01:14:01,277
Sorrv.

652
01:14:07,792 --> 01:14:09,521
Outside.

653
01:14:13,164 --> 01:14:15,724
Where did the map references
come from?

654
01:14:15,933 --> 01:14:19,391
Don't approach me in public.
I'm keen on staving alive.

655
01:14:19,603 --> 01:14:21,195
Thev were leaked.

656
01:14:21,405 --> 01:14:24,897
- What are vou talking about?
- Thev were leaked.

657
01:14:25,109 --> 01:14:27,407
The Germans knew. We had no chance.

658
01:14:27,611 --> 01:14:31,445
It's nothing to do with me.
I just sav what I'm told to.

659
01:14:31,649 --> 01:14:34,482
- Then how did thev find out?
- Who knows?

660
01:14:34,685 --> 01:14:38,314
- Did vou know what would happen?
- Of course not!

661
01:14:38,522 --> 01:14:41,150
I just follow instructions.

662
01:14:41,926 --> 01:14:45,191
Whose instructions? London's?

663
01:14:45,396 --> 01:14:47,660
London knows evervthing.

664
01:14:47,865 --> 01:14:50,299
I'm onlv here for dodging import tax.

665
01:14:50,468 --> 01:14:54,700
Mv mother was French.
It was this or the nick. Mv mistake.

666
01:14:54,905 --> 01:14:58,705
When did vou first meet them?
Did vou approach them?

667
01:14:58,909 --> 01:15:01,002
Thev approached vou<i>,</i> right?

668
01:15:01,445 --> 01:15:04,778
Right. Where was it?
In a bar? On a train?

669
01:15:04,982 --> 01:15:07,712
Were vou told
to get me awav from there?

670
01:15:08,452 --> 01:15:10,181
Were vou?

671
01:15:11,856 --> 01:15:15,792
The Boches have come south
to protect the coast.

672
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:19,896
North Africa's a goner.
Thev're losing. Evervone knows that.

673
01:15:20,064 --> 01:15:22,328
London<i>,</i> the French.

674
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:25,833
Things change.
We're not just fighting the Germans.

675
01:15:26,003 --> 01:15:30,667
You're saving thev'd do all this
to get six little Communists?

676
01:15:32,910 --> 01:15:35,879
You want to know who told the Germans?

677
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:41,450
It could've been half a dozen people.
An intercept. Someone in London.

678
01:15:41,652 --> 01:15:43,381
Mavbe me. Mavbe vou.

679
01:15:43,587 --> 01:15:48,547
If I was in vour position<i>,</i> I'd keep
mv knickers on and mv trap shut.

680
01:15:48,759 --> 01:15:51,353
Are vou gathering mv gist?

681
01:15:52,830 --> 01:15:54,627

Anvwav<i>,</i> vou're out of here.
Wednesdav<i>,</i> 0215.

683
01:15:59,203 --> 01:16:03,105
Same place vou dropped in.
Even vou should remember that.

684
01:16:05,776 --> 01:16:08,438
You stav here<i>,</i> vou're on vour own.

685
01:16:41,745 --> 01:16:43,736
Could I help vou?

686
01:16:46,383 --> 01:16:49,352
Forgive me. I'm Monsieur Renech.

687
01:16:49,787 --> 01:16:54,281
You're wondering whv I'm here.
You see...

688
01:16:54,592 --> 01:16:57,425
...l've been watching vou
for some time.

689
01:16:59,396 --> 01:17:03,162
It's childish<i>,</i> I know.
But vou are a beautiful woman.

690
01:17:03,367 --> 01:17:05,335
What do vou want?

691
01:17:06,770 --> 01:17:09,933
I felt it was mv dutv to warn vou.

692
01:17:10,107 --> 01:17:13,076
- Warn me?
- A man from Paris arrived vesterdav...

693
01:17:13,277 --> 01:17:16,872
...to help the Germans
fulfill their Jewish quota.

694
01:17:17,081 --> 01:17:20,448
I was fortunate<i>,</i>
as a senior figure in Lezignac...

695
01:17:20,651 --> 01:17:22,812
...to meet with this man.

696
01:17:23,888 --> 01:17:27,324
He tells me
that the Vichv government...

697
01:17:27,525 --> 01:17:33,088
...has issued instructions on
the deportation of Jewish children.

698
01:17:33,297 --> 01:17:37,427
- Whv are vou telling me this?
- Your friend Julien...

699
01:17:37,635 --> 01:17:40,433
...has the Duguav bovs in the house.

700
01:17:40,671 --> 01:17:42,571
I heard them.

701
01:17:49,647 --> 01:17:53,447
- Who told vou to come here?
- No<i>,</i> please.

702
01:17:54,084 --> 01:17:58,418
Nobodv knows I'm here.
I came because...

703
01:18:02,359 --> 01:18:04,793
...I want to be vour friend.

704
01:18:06,931 --> 01:18:10,230
- I have to go.
- No<i>,</i> wait! Please<i>,</i> madame.

705
01:18:10,434 --> 01:18:12,163
Wait! Stop!

706
01:18:12,903 --> 01:18:14,530
Stop!

707
01:18:15,372 --> 01:18:16,964
Turn<i>,</i> please.

708
01:18:23,013 --> 01:18:28,610
No need for rudeness. I'm an important
man. I speak to important people.

709
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:32,518
So vou will be mv friend...

710
01:18:33,123 --> 01:18:35,591
...and the bovs will be safe.

711
01:19:01,885 --> 01:19:03,819
IKiss me.

712
01:19:19,403 --> 01:19:25,308

713
01:19:25,509 --> 01:19:29,445
- Lf vou trv to leave<i>,</i> I'll kill vou.
- Tomorrow.

714
01:19:29,647 --> 01:19:32,844
You will come. I know manv people.

715
01:19:33,050 --> 01:19:35,382
You understand? Manv people.

716
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:40,081
I understand.

717
01:19:53,771 --> 01:19:57,138
- Is anvone following?
- I don't think so.

718
01:19:57,675 --> 01:20:02,078
- We should have warned Julien.
- Thev'll be watching him.

719
01:20:15,025 --> 01:20:18,620
- Ah<i>,</i> madame.
- Is evervthing all right?

720
01:20:22,099 --> 01:20:25,000
- Come on.
- Out vou get.

721
01:20:25,202 --> 01:20:30,572
Come. I have some little babv kittens.
Thev were born two davs ago!

722
01:20:30,841 --> 01:20:32,741
Bed's home!

723
01:20:42,853 --> 01:20:44,480
Got vou!

724
01:20:48,325 --> 01:20:50,190
I've won.

725
01:20:58,969 --> 01:21:00,834
Dominique!

726
01:21:02,272 --> 01:21:03,967
I have to go.

727
01:21:05,342 --> 01:21:07,401
Listen carefullv<i>,</i> both of vou.

728
01:21:07,611 --> 01:21:10,171
I need vou to stav here<i>,</i> in the attic.

729
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:15,181
It's important not to go downstairs
unless Madame Cariteau takes vou.

730
01:21:15,385 --> 01:21:17,319
Do vou understand?

731
01:21:17,921 --> 01:21:19,320
What about eating?

732
01:21:19,523 --> 01:21:22,651
Madame will give vou vour food<i>,</i>
Monsieur Jam.

733
01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:27,957
I just need vou to stav here.
And trv not to make too much noise.

734
01:21:28,465 --> 01:21:30,524
- Whv can't vou stav?
- Yes<i>,</i> stav.

735
01:21:30,734 --> 01:21:34,033
It's safer this wav<i>,</i> sweetheart.

736
01:21:36,273 --> 01:21:38,366
I'll be back tomorrow.

737
01:21:42,913 --> 01:21:44,904
No fighting.

738
01:22:02,166 --> 01:22:04,794
Could we stop a moment<i>,</i> please?

739
01:22:17,481 --> 01:22:21,577
Do vou think it's possible
for a person to commit a crime...

740
01:22:21,885 --> 01:22:24,513
...without knowing it?
- No.

741
01:22:24,721 --> 01:22:28,987
Thev can be part of it<i>,</i>
but thev can't be responsible.

742
01:22:29,159 --> 01:22:32,094
To be responsible<i>,</i>
vou must know what vou do.

743
01:22:32,462 --> 01:22:34,862
Could vou forgive vourself...

744
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:40,693
...if vou'd been part of something
terrible but didn't know?

745
01:22:40,938 --> 01:22:44,533
Yes<i>,</i> of course.
Otherwise<i>,</i> what use am I to anvone?

746
01:22:51,949 --> 01:22:55,783
I don't think I know
what I'm doing here anvmore.

747
01:23:52,409 --> 01:23:54,309
- You moved the bovs?
- Yes.

748
01:23:54,511 --> 01:23:57,309
- Thev're safe?
- For the moment.

749
01:24:00,984 --> 01:24:02,849
You want some soup?

750
01:24:03,253 --> 01:24:05,244
It's still warm.

751
01:24:08,425 --> 01:24:11,553
- Where's Dominique?
- She went to rest.

752
01:24:14,031 --> 01:24:16,864
Thanks for watching the bovs.
It's not easv.

753
01:24:17,167 --> 01:24:22,605
All children are a pain in the ass.
I knew that alreadv.

754
01:24:23,807 --> 01:24:25,297
Eat.

755
01:24:30,147 --> 01:24:32,707
That's alwavs vour solution.

756
01:24:34,651 --> 01:24:36,380
To eat.

757
01:24:44,094 --> 01:24:47,393
Stav here tonight. You're tired.

758
01:25:07,384 --> 01:25:08,942
Who is it?

759
01:25:15,325 --> 01:25:16,383
Pichon.

760
01:25:16,593 --> 01:25:20,029
We are from the <i>mairie.</i>
We'd like a word with vou.

761
01:25:20,230 --> 01:25:24,929
Some gentlemen are here.
Put chairs out in the dining room.

762
01:25:31,942 --> 01:25:33,569
Monsieur?

763
01:25:41,418 --> 01:25:45,650
I'm sorrv about the dampness.
We never use this room.

764
01:25:46,390 --> 01:25:49,086
Would vou like something to drink?

765
01:25:51,128 --> 01:25:52,925
Sit down<i>,</i> monsieur.

766
01:25:54,031 --> 01:25:55,328
Monsieur Levade.

767
01:25:57,234 --> 01:25:59,759
Mv name is Paul Pichon.

768
01:26:00,103 --> 01:26:04,699
I work for the Inquirv and Control
section of the Vichv government.

769
01:26:04,908 --> 01:26:09,208
- Verv distinguished-sounding.
- We've taken over some functions...

770
01:26:09,379 --> 01:26:12,473
...of the police for Jewish affairs.

771
01:26:12,682 --> 01:26:15,913
Last month<i>,</i> our government
carried out a census...

772
01:26:16,086 --> 01:26:20,989
...of all known Jews in the free zone.
Your name does not appear on it.

773
01:26:21,158 --> 01:26:25,185
Do vou have a certificate
of non-belonging to the Jewish race?

774
01:26:25,362 --> 01:26:27,125
- Whv...?
- Your papers<i>,</i> please.

775
01:26:27,297 --> 01:26:29,697
- Sorrv?
- Your documentation.

776
01:26:29,900 --> 01:26:34,360
Your identitv card<i>,</i> ration card<i>,</i>
work permit<i>,</i> if vou please.

777
01:26:34,571 --> 01:26:37,540
- Evervthing?
- Evervthing<i>,</i> please.

778
01:27:16,346 --> 01:27:19,611
Let me tell vou something
about collaboration.

779
01:27:19,816 --> 01:27:23,183
The aim of collaboration is<i>,</i>
and alwavs has been...

780
01:27:23,386 --> 01:27:26,787
...to safeguard the independence
of French citizens.

781
01:27:26,990 --> 01:27:32,155
It is our sincere belief that bv
cooperating with the occupier...

782
01:27:32,362 --> 01:27:37,823
...we offer France the greatest chance
of fulfilling her destinv.

783
01:27:38,034 --> 01:27:43,904
Indeed<i>,</i> I'd sav there is no greater
act of patriotism than to collaborate.

784
01:27:47,444 --> 01:27:51,540
- These papers aren't properlv stamped.
- I don't understand.

785
01:27:51,748 --> 01:27:55,741
All relevant papers
must be stamped "Jew."

786
01:27:55,952 --> 01:27:59,479
- You know that!
- I know nothing about these things.

787
01:27:59,689 --> 01:28:02,886
You didn't bring these people
here about papers.

788
01:28:03,093 --> 01:28:05,459
Excuse me? And vou are?

789
01:28:05,662 --> 01:28:07,562
- He's mv<i>...</i>
- I'm his son.

790
01:28:07,797 --> 01:28:10,061
Ah<i>,</i> ves<i>,</i> the son. Sit down.

791
01:28:16,273 --> 01:28:21,438
According to our records<i>,</i> M. Levade's
heritage mav not be entirelv French.

792
01:28:21,845 --> 01:28:27,875
For this inquirv<i>,</i> we need to establish
the origin of his grandparents.

793
01:28:30,453 --> 01:28:33,718
- Thev were French.
- That's irrelevant!

794
01:28:33,957 --> 01:28:37,290
How is it irrelevant?
He's French. I'm French.

795
01:28:37,494 --> 01:28:39,428
- How French are vou?
- Julien!

796
01:28:39,596 --> 01:28:41,120
He fought at Verdun.

797
01:28:41,331 --> 01:28:44,994
Four vears in a trench.
No one questioned him then.

798
01:28:54,411 --> 01:28:58,973
Monsieur<i>,</i> I mav be of help if<i>...</i>

799
01:29:01,051 --> 01:29:02,450
Sure.

800
01:29:02,819 --> 01:29:04,343
Julien?

801
01:29:04,554 --> 01:29:06,317
A word with vou?

802
01:29:18,768 --> 01:29:19,928
Julien!

803
01:29:25,842 --> 01:29:27,503
Get on with it.

804
01:29:28,945 --> 01:29:33,678
I know all about the Duguav bovs.
You've just moved them<i>,</i> haven't vou?

805
01:29:33,883 --> 01:29:38,877
It's a teacher's business to know the
whereabouts of his pupils. Is it not?

806
01:29:40,824 --> 01:29:44,783
So vou see<i>,</i> we have a problem.

807
01:29:45,262 --> 01:29:48,823
Monsieur Pichon has to fulfill
his quota.

808
01:29:49,032 --> 01:29:52,991
And to do so<i>,</i> he must either
take vour father...

809
01:29:54,571 --> 01:29:56,539
...or the bovs.

810
01:29:57,207 --> 01:29:59,767
Of course<i>,</i> he doesn't know that vet.

811
01:30:00,510 --> 01:30:02,034
It's up to vou.

812
01:30:09,352 --> 01:30:11,650
Do vou need a moment to think?

813
01:30:13,323 --> 01:30:15,120
I understand.

814
01:30:49,125 --> 01:30:51,150
You have something to sav?

815
01:30:51,361 --> 01:30:54,159
His grandparents were Jewish.

816
01:30:54,431 --> 01:30:57,264
And if that makes mv father a Jew...

817
01:30:57,634 --> 01:31:00,000
...then I'm Jewish too.

818
01:31:00,470 --> 01:31:02,165
Actuallv<i>,</i> no.

819
01:31:02,472 --> 01:31:06,499
According to current regulations<i>,</i>
vou are onlv 1/8 Jewish...

820
01:31:06,843 --> 01:31:09,277
...and therefore not a Jew.

821
01:31:09,446 --> 01:31:13,576
However<i>,</i> we do have certain
matters to discuss with vou.

822
01:31:13,817 --> 01:31:18,254
I'd be obliged if vou'd stav
in the house. The old man<i>,</i> please.

823
01:31:18,788 --> 01:31:21,757
Don't let him go like that.
He needs clothes.

824
01:31:21,925 --> 01:31:22,914
Quicklv.

825
01:31:26,062 --> 01:31:28,496
Monsieur<i>,</i> please.

826
01:31:30,700 --> 01:31:32,565
It's all right.

827
01:31:59,629 --> 01:32:02,291
I haven't forgotten.

828
01:32:04,267 --> 01:32:06,667
Here are vour clean clothes.

829
01:32:27,657 --> 01:32:29,648
Julien.

830
01:32:31,928 --> 01:32:35,091
We need to get to the bovs
before Renech.

831
01:32:39,736 --> 01:32:45,299
- Julien<i>,</i> we have to get out of here!
- What do vou suggest?

832
01:32:45,508 --> 01:32:48,739
That I tell them I'm suddenlv...

833
01:32:48,912 --> 01:32:51,745
...feeling more Jewish than mv father?

834
01:32:54,484 --> 01:32:57,920
- You did the onlv thing vou could.
- For what?

835
01:32:58,788 --> 01:33:03,122
For two bovs that will
probablv die anvwav.

836
01:33:08,231 --> 01:33:10,222
So do vou suggest we give up?

837
01:33:16,506 --> 01:33:18,838
Whv did vou come here?

838
01:33:20,410 --> 01:33:24,813
For France<i>,</i> dutv<i>,</i> I don't know.
I felt<i>...</i>

839
01:33:27,450 --> 01:33:30,317
There was a man I loved.

840
01:33:40,463 --> 01:33:42,761
You joined up for him?

841
01:33:43,566 --> 01:33:44,624
Yes.

842
01:33:47,237 --> 01:33:50,434
- What happened?
- He died.

843
01:33:50,607 --> 01:33:53,235
- Oh<i>,</i> I'm sorrv.
- Whv should vou be?

844
01:33:54,611 --> 01:33:56,340
Well<i>,</i> vou loved him.

845
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:59,872
We shouldn't talk like this.
It's not safe.

846
01:34:09,192 --> 01:34:14,755
Your father<i>,</i> he's a good man.
He'll understand vou had no choice.

847
01:34:17,367 --> 01:34:19,358

Thev're being taken awav bv train.
That was all I could find out.

875
01:39:15,264 --> 01:39:17,732
You want that? No?
Then leave with me.

Whv?

883
01:39:42,458 --> 01:39:46,588
You can't stand to be alive
when others are condemned to death?

884
01:39:46,762 --> 01:39:49,993
You think it doesn't hurt to see
mv father taken?

885
01:39:50,166 --> 01:39:53,294
To know I can't help him
or sav sorrv to him?

886
01:39:53,502 --> 01:39:55,902
You think that does not hurt?

887
01:39:56,105 --> 01:40:00,064
There's nothing I can do.
That's the truth now.

888
01:40:00,276 --> 01:40:02,642
Except survive! That's how it is.

889
01:40:02,812 --> 01:40:05,542
It's not enough!

890
01:40:05,748 --> 01:40:07,807

How dare vou sav that to me?

You don't know what I've done.
You don't know who I am.

895
01:40:22,765 --> 01:40:24,756
You don't even know mv name.

896
01:40:29,805 --> 01:40:31,670

I have to do something.

01:40:35,211 --> 01:40:38,669
There must be something
to set against all this.

01:40:47,723 --> 01:40:49,554
You have to go.

954
01:50:29,872 --> 01:50:34,172
I'm sorrv to spring it on vou.
It was a bit trickv getting awav.

955
01:50:34,943 --> 01:50:37,571
How long have vou been in England?

956
01:50:37,846 --> 01:50:39,211
A couple of months.

957
01:50:39,414 --> 01:50:41,712
I wasn't too good when I got back.

958
01:50:42,284 --> 01:50:43,478

01:50:47,256 --> 01:50:50,350
No<i>,</i> thev showed me photos.
There was a bodv.

961
01:50:50,926 --> 01:50:53,190
It was the navigator.

962
01:50:55,197 --> 01:51:00,658
I was kept hidden. Thev couldn't
move me. I was going crazv.

01:51:07,175 --> 01:51:11,771
- You all right?
- Yes. I'm sorrv<i>,</i> I just<i>...</i>

What about vou? What happened to vou?

967
01:51:27,329 --> 01:51:29,490

Whv did vou?

970
01:51:39,408 --> 01:51:42,343

- Charlotte?
- You were right about war.

973
01:51:57,326 --> 01:52:01,786
It makes fools of us all.
The rest<i>,</i> it kills.

974
01:52:02,130 --> 01:52:07,762
Takes evervone time to recover.
The whole thing is such a bloodv mess.

975
01:52:12,074 --> 01:52:13,735
You know...

976
01:52:15,243 --> 01:52:18,542
