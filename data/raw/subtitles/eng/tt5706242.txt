1
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:46,959
HUMPHREY: Okay, pups.
As we continue

2
00:00:46,959 --> 00:00:50,208
on our first family vacation
to Alfred Creek Falls,

3
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:54,625
it's time for my infamous
animal impressions.

4
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:58,291
KATE: Groans?
 Come on, pups.

5
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:01,875
You used to love
dad's animal impressions.

6
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:03,291
CLAUDETTE:
Until they got weird.

7
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:05,041
HUMPHREY: Weird, Claudette?

8
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:07,625
STINKY: Yeah, Dad.
I gotta agree with
Claudette on this one.

9
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:09,959
I mean,
doing a porpoise impression.

10
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:12,500
PUPS: Weird.

11
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,000
Claudette,
why the long face?

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,959
Mom, why couldn't
we bring our friends?

13
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:20,875
We've gone over this,
Claudette.

14
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:23,291
This is a family vacation.

15
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,041
And our first one together.

16
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:26,375
KATE: We get closer

17
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:28,625
when we have these
shared experiences.

18
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:32,125
And what do we always say
about a strong family Huh?

19
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:35,500
ALL: A strong family can
survive almost anything.

20
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:41,041
She has puppy love.

21
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:43,500
Puppy love?
Like a boyfriend?

22
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,458
Oh...
Wait a minute.

23
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:46,625
You mean Fleet?

24
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:48,041
Mom, chill.

25
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:52,458
He's not my boyfriend,
he's just a friend.

26
00:01:53,709 --> 00:01:55,333
Okay, when you
come to a corner,

27
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:58,166
plant your front paws
and just let your body slide.

28
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:03,667
Your turn!

29
00:02:07,667 --> 00:02:09,417
Plant your paws!
Whoa...

30
00:02:14,542 --> 00:02:15,875
Fleet?

31
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,583
Mmm...

32
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:24,417
(CLAUDETTE MAKING
KISSING SOUNDS)

33
00:02:24,417 --> 00:02:26,333
Sorry.

34
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,583
I was just, uh,

35
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,208
thinking about
all my great friends!

36
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:33,333
Did you hear that,
Stinky?

37
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:34,542
Fleet's just a friend.

38
00:02:34,542 --> 00:02:36,875
Hey, I'm staying
above the fray,

39
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:40,333
but let me just say,
Fleet is one fast dog.

40
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:43,083
Especially with
the kissy snout.

41
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:44,667
Humphrey,
did you hear that?

42
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:47,458
Mom, stop it.
You're being controlling!

43
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,583
I'm being a parent!

44
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:52,750
And, Runt, you wanna
lose a patch of fur?

45
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,417
Just keeping it real.

46
00:02:54,417 --> 00:02:56,750
Ha! How's this for real?

47
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,375
You, uh...

48
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:07,417
Hey!

49
00:03:07,417 --> 00:03:08,917
Boy, she missed again.

50
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,000
Well, at least
they're not bored
anymore.

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,458
Runt,
you get down here!

52
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:15,875
Claudette, stop it!

53
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,792
Hey, you two,
knock it off!

54
00:03:17,792 --> 00:03:19,583
Oh, she missed again,
and again.

55
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:22,250
Should have taken
those tree climbing
lessons I offered.

56
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:27,083
Mom, Dad, may I suggest
some parenting tips?

57
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:30,500
When I become the leader,
I will create a wolf park,

58
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,667
so the younger ones
can be supervised.

59
00:03:32,667 --> 00:03:35,333
Okay, Runt, come down.

60
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,125
Claudette, stand down,

61
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:38,959
and, Stinky,
my eldest son,

62
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,083
that was the most
ridiculous idea
I've ever heard.

63
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,667
And, Runt,
what about you?

64
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:47,750
Constantly hugging
Frieda and Fran,
the porcupines!

65
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,625
Yeah,
that's really normal!

66
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:53,375
Wait! That's why I'm always
pulling needles out of you?

67
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:55,417
They never get hugs!

68
00:03:55,417 --> 00:03:57,291
Because they're mean girls!

69
00:03:57,291 --> 00:04:00,333
Oh, they're not mean,
they're just, prickly.

70
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,125
And they wanted to
come on our trip too!

71
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,166
And just to
roll with that,

72
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:06,166
if I had been able
to bring Brent,

73
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,667
he could have helped
supervise these two.

74
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:10,291
Oh, great.

75
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:13,875
All we need is your
grizzly bear bromance
tagging along!

76
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:15,375
Seriously, Stinky,

77
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:18,500
Brent is cool,
but he is a hot mess.

78
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,959
He's not a mess.

79
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:23,375
Huh? He travels with
a porcupine life coach!

80
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:25,208
Hello.

81
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:26,959
Agnes keeps him chill!

82
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:29,333
Okay, Runt, you get
down here right now!

83
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,583
And, Claudette,
when we get back,

84
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:35,208
I'm going to leash Fleet
and tie him to a tree!

85
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,375
And, Stinky,

86
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:37,667
you know we respect
mixing it up

87
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:39,000
with all the critters,

88
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,458
but a little bit of Brent
goes a long way.

89
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:43,917
Also, his grizzly momma
scares the heck out of me.

90
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:45,458
If I had pants
I would be wetting them.

91
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:47,041
Seriously, Stinky,

92
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:50,041
the last time I asked
if you and he could
have a play date,

93
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,917
she growled at me!

94
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:54,041
Brent and I have big plans

95
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:56,041
when we lead
the forest one day.

96
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:58,875
We're gonna merge
the wolf pack with
the bear clan.

97
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:01,959
Great idea!

98
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:05,083
What do they say
about brilliance
skipping a generation?

99
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:08,000
Come on, guys,
you love each other.

100
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,417
Claudette, remember
that time you and Stinky

101
00:05:09,417 --> 00:05:11,542
almost died trying
to save Runt?

102
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,709
This is for Runt!

103
00:05:14,709 --> 00:05:16,375
Ahhh!
Ahhh!

104
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,417
KATE: Stinky!

105
00:05:18,417 --> 00:05:19,917
HUMPHREY: Stinky!

106
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,500
KATE AND HUMPHREY:
Claudette!

107
00:05:25,417 --> 00:05:27,875
Oh, my gosh. What do we...
Jump! Jump!

108
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:34,750
Guilt.

109
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,083
BOTH: Mmm-hmm.

110
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:40,250
Can we please continue
our lovely family vacation?

111
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,709
Take a look
at that view.

112
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:54,125
Isn't it something?

113
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:55,917
Just gorgeous.

114
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,041
What is it, Stinky?

115
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:03,250
I smell wolves,
coming close.

116
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,542
RUNT: And your smell
is right again.

117
00:06:05,542 --> 00:06:07,250
Hurry, Julia, hurry!

118
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,959
Wait, wait!
What is going on?

119
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:11,250
You need
to get out of here!

120
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,500
What

121
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,917
They're trapping wolves!

122
00:06:13,917 --> 00:06:15,250
Trapping wolves?

123
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,709
They're relocating us.

124
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,458
When the caribou
population dwindled...

125
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:21,125
Relocating?
Are we seriously
back to that?

126
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:23,834
Oh, they're taking
away all the forest,

127
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:27,125
and when the forest goes,
so go the caribou.

128
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:29,208
They're also
capturing wolf pups!

129
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:31,125
What?
They're transporting them

130
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,000
to the other side
of the country.

131
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,458
Humphrey and I have
been through this before.

132
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:39,583
KATE: Ow!

133
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,417
Where am I?

134
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:46,542
Humphrey,
is that you?

135
00:06:46,542 --> 00:06:49,083
Kate, where are we?

136
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,291
I don't know.

137
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:52,500
Oh, maybe we're dead.

138
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:56,291
Nope.
Definitely not dead.
Ow!

139
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:59,166
Well, at least
they left us some water.

140
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,917
You got water?

141
00:07:01,917 --> 00:07:04,000
Nope,
definitely not water.

142
00:07:05,667 --> 00:07:07,166
Little piece of advice.

143
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:10,166
If you wake up in a crate,
don't drink the water.

144
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:12,041
Are they capturing
wolves everywhere?

145
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:15,000
No, not past the border
or the mountains.

146
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,834
Most of the wolves are
hiding in the mountains.

147
00:07:16,834 --> 00:07:18,959
That's where Liz
and I are going.

148
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:24,333
Quick,
under the trees.
Now!

149
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,959
They're even shooting
from the air.

150
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:33,250
But only tranquilizer guns.

151
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,709
"Only tranquilizer guns."

152
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:36,667
They can do a lot of harm.

153
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,250
KATE:
Oh, you make me so mad!

154
00:07:41,542 --> 00:07:43,375
Whoa, hey,
I was just kidding.

155
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,834
Huh.

156
00:07:47,709 --> 00:07:49,208
You're kinda cute.

157
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,875
Really

158
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:54,375
So... Wow! Okay.
Cute, yeah.

159
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:55,792
That's the... Look.

160
00:07:55,792 --> 00:07:57,166
Thank you, first of all,

161
00:07:57,166 --> 00:08:00,458
but do you mean "cute"
in like a rugged,

162
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,583
kind of handsomely cute...

163
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:05,083
Yow!
Again with the butt.

164
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,500
These mosquitoes
are out of control.

165
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,208
Ooh.

166
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:13,083
I'll meet you on Mars. Ooh.

167
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:16,875
Right after I eat
the Milky Way.

168
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:19,083
Ooh, that sounds good.

169
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:25,875
Save some for me.

170
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,417
So how are you two gonna
get to the mountains?

171
00:08:35,417 --> 00:08:37,750
There are too many fields,
you'll be spotted.

172
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,125
We don't have a choice.

173
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,208
They're combing the forest
right behind us.

174
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,083
You and your family
need to hide.

175
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,917
How long is this
gonna go on?

176
00:08:44,917 --> 00:08:47,750
It usually lasts
five moons or so.

177
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,375
We're going for it!

178
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,041
KATE: Be careful!

179
00:08:57,917 --> 00:08:59,417
Go, go, go!

180
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,417
Oh, no!
Come on, come on!

181
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,667
Kate, the pups!

182
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:08,083
We'll never make
it to the mountains
from here.

183
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,250
Too many fields.

184
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,792
We gotta go across
the border.

185
00:09:10,792 --> 00:09:13,792
Okay, the border.
But, Humphrey,

186
00:09:13,792 --> 00:09:15,917
we still gotta get
across that field!

187
00:09:16,792 --> 00:09:18,083
STINKY: Wait a minute.

188
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,041
I smell humans coming.

189
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,583
It must be the trappers.

190
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,542
How far is the train?
The train?

191
00:09:23,542 --> 00:09:26,792
It's the fastest way
to the border,
and we did it once.

192
00:09:26,792 --> 00:09:29,959
Yeah, but getting to
it was something else.

193
00:09:31,917 --> 00:09:33,500
Hey, need a ride?

194
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,792
Jump! Trust me!

195
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,458
I told you
you could trust me.

196
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,542
Angle left!

197
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:50,792
Roll right!

198
00:09:52,542 --> 00:09:54,333
Yee-haw!

199
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,125
Why are you looking
at me like that?

200
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:06,625
Huh?

201
00:10:13,542 --> 00:10:15,291
Wow. Now that
was a hybrid ride.

202
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,875
Half wind power,
half run for your life.

203
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,375
Okay, let me listen
for this train.

204
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,041
There is one coming,
but we gotta move fast!

205
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:38,041
We can get across
the field with that.

206
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:41,375
You can't log
board across a flat field!

207
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,375
We're not going to.

208
00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:55,041
HUMPHREY:
Kate, can you see
the train tracks?

209
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,375
KATE: Um...

210
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:57,667
I think...

211
00:10:57,667 --> 00:10:59,375
Yes, we gotta turn.

212
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,250
Okay, Runt,
start to turn...

213
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,709
Right. Right.

214
00:11:02,709 --> 00:11:05,166
Your other right.

215
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:08,917
Okay, stop.
Now everyone forward.

216
00:11:08,917 --> 00:11:12,625
CLAUDETTE: Hey, Runt,
how does it feel
to be the caboose?

217
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,625
CLAUDETTE: Ow!
Mom, Runt bit my tail!

218
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:20,417
STINKY: Could you two
exhibit some maturity

219
00:11:20,417 --> 00:11:21,750
in this very
dramatic situation?

220
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,917
CLAUDETTE: How's that
for maturity, Stinky?

221
00:11:25,917 --> 00:11:28,417
HUMPHREY:
Everyone, quiet.

222
00:11:34,417 --> 00:11:37,250
JETHRO: Well, two wolves
is better than nothing.

223
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:40,750
Okay.
Let's each grab one.

224
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,208
They'll be out
just long enough

225
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,166
to get them
to the station.

226
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,750
GRIFFIN: Where the heck
have the rest of the dang
wolves gone anyway?

227
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,542
It's like they vanished.

228
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:51,208
You know what?
We gotta get us
some dang wolf cubs.

229
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,125
We get three times
more for a wolf cub.

230
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,583
Yeah, but our plane
can't find wolf cubs,

231
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,458
they're only in dens.

232
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:59,959
Then we'll have
to find them ourselves.

233
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,417
We gotta move now.

234
00:12:02,417 --> 00:12:03,959
GRIFFIN:
What the heck
is this log

235
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:05,458
doing in the middle
of this field?

236
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,917
JETHRO:
Waiting for my butt
to sit on.

237
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,291
Wolves, you gotta run
like you've never run
before, okay?

238
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:15,166
GRIFFIN: We gotta
get these two back
to the station

239
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:16,417
and into a cart.

240
00:12:16,417 --> 00:12:17,959
One truck's
leaving tonight.

241
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,417
Okay, now!

242
00:12:28,792 --> 00:12:31,000
Look! Wolf pups.
There's wolf pups!

243
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,458
There are three
dang wolf pups!

244
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:33,875
And two adults!

245
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,834
Brother,
we hit the jackpot!

246
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,792
Wolves,
give it all you've got!

247
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:41,166
Come on, come on!

248
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:47,500
Kate, weapons
of wolf destruction.

249
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,041
Everyone, break formation.

250
00:12:50,542 --> 00:12:52,166
Let's do our thing!

251
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,500
You mean our being chased
by big mean bears thing?

252
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,625
Good thinking, wolves!

253
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,125
Where'd you learn
to do that?

254
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,041
CLAUDETTE: From being
chased by bears.

255
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,000
STINKY:
We've clearly bitten off
more than we could hunt

256
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,667
numerous times.

257
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,083
Hey, brother,
I can't aim with
you doing this.

258
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:17,792
I can't see!
I don't wanna
run over one of them.

259
00:13:17,792 --> 00:13:19,000
We need them alive!

260
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,667
When I say "now,"
skid and pivot!

261
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,375
Now!

262
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,834
Just great, Jethro!

263
00:13:39,834 --> 00:13:41,041
Where did you learn
to shoot, dang it?

264
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,750
Same place you learned
to drive, Griffin!

265
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,709
Missed it, darn.

266
00:13:51,709 --> 00:13:53,375
There's always
a night train.

267
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,917
We just gotta
hide until then.

268
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:58,250
Somewhere they
can't find us.

269
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:00,750
RUNT: I have an idea.

270
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,917
Oh, where could Kate,
Humphrey, and the pups be?

271
00:14:07,917 --> 00:14:10,083
Winston said they were
going to the Falls.

272
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,750
They should be
around here by now,

273
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,083
but there's no sign of them!

274
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:16,000
Oh, no! You don't think
that they got captured

275
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,083
and they're being
transported already.

276
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:20,750
Oh, I can't imagine,
but it's happened before.

277
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,417
Oh, Paddy,
look down there.

278
00:14:23,917 --> 00:14:26,000
Uh, excuse me.

279
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,417
Fleet, Brent, Agnes,
what are you three doing?

280
00:14:29,417 --> 00:14:31,750
Oh, Marcel and Paddy,

281
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:35,291
the only two birds
that don't bother me.

282
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,125
Now, Brent, if you
can just get over

283
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,458
the five billion
other birds.

284
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,083
Hey, guys, what's up?

285
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:43,917
Fleet, haven't you heard
there is a wolf curfew?

286
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:46,166
There are trappers
looking for wolves.

287
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:47,792
You were supposed to
go to the mountains.

288
00:14:47,792 --> 00:14:50,625
No, wait.
Claudette is headed
to the Falls,

289
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:53,417
I gotta make sure
she's safe and doesn't
get captured!

290
00:14:53,417 --> 00:14:54,917
She's my girl.

291
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:56,041
Young love.

292
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:58,083
Well, a young something.

293
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:01,792
Fleet, that is admirable,
but there is a premium
for wolf pups!

294
00:15:01,792 --> 00:15:04,125
We know. That is
where we come in.

295
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,875
We're all helping.

296
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,792
Oh, helping?
And how?

297
00:15:07,792 --> 00:15:09,125
We got it all worked out.

298
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:13,291
When they try
and capture Fleet,
I do this!

299
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:14,959
Ahhh!
And I do this.

300
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,166
You see, the humans
aren't allowed

301
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,125
to capture
the other animals.

302
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:22,834
Besides, I gotta stick up
for my main bro Stinky.

303
00:15:22,834 --> 00:15:24,625
Huh? Oh.

304
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,208
It's a bromance thing.

305
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:29,125
Oh, I get it.
Yes, your heart aches
for your friends.

306
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:31,834
But it's not
practical to put
yourself in danger

307
00:15:31,834 --> 00:15:33,083
while doing it.

308
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,959
Claudette is gonna
be with me

309
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,750
for the rest
of my life,

310
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:40,166
and nothing is gonna
stop me from finding her.

311
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,750
Okay, okay, all right.

312
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,583
Well, stay along
this trail, lover boy.

313
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:46,375
We'll try
and locate them.
And be very careful.

314
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:56,834
Who are they?

315
00:15:56,834 --> 00:16:00,834
O-M-G, like, it's us,
with bad needles.

316
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:03,375
That girl needs
some serious
quill extensions!

317
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,834
Didn't someone tell them
the Goth look is out?

318
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,667
Okay, ladies,
cool the quills.

319
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:14,875
I'm Brent.
That is Agnes.

320
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:18,083
As you can see some
of my best friends
are porcupines.

321
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:22,125
Since you all look alike,
can't you all be friends?

322
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,417
Look, country bear,

323
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:25,959
I'm Fran and this is
my sister Frieda.

324
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:27,375
We are here to help Runt.

325
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,542
Like, he is
a wolf in need

326
00:16:29,542 --> 00:16:31,709
and he is our king
of Shadow Forest.

327
00:16:31,709 --> 00:16:34,542
Well, we're here
for Stinky.
And Claudette.

328
00:16:34,542 --> 00:16:37,375
Who's the pretty boy?
Shouldn't he be in hiding?

329
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,458
Ew. Look at that
fluffed-up mane,

330
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:43,750
now there is some
serious product in that.

331
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,041
My name's Fleet.

332
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:47,333
He's Claudette's boyfriend.

333
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:50,166
Claudette? As in
"Little Miss Attitude?"

334
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:52,917
There seems to be
a lot of it around here.

335
00:16:52,917 --> 00:16:54,875
You two better go
on your own road.

336
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,583
Um, how would you like
a giant splinter

337
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:00,166
in your paw, tubby?

338
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:01,792
It's my hibernation weight.

339
00:17:01,792 --> 00:17:03,083
Back off, sister!

340
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,917
Ladies, stop it!

341
00:17:04,917 --> 00:17:08,250
We're gonna all find
them together, okay?

342
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,375
Let's go!

343
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:13,750
Nope, burrow empty!

344
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,458
Where could
they have gone?

345
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,917
The plane didn't
see them leaving
this dang forest!

346
00:17:17,917 --> 00:17:19,250
Where are they?

347
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:24,959
RUNT: Okay, Mom, Dad,

348
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,417
remember that thing
you said about
shared experiences?

349
00:17:28,417 --> 00:17:30,792
HUMPHREY: Runt, who taught
you to climb trees anyway?

350
00:17:30,792 --> 00:17:33,125
Hey, I watch
the porcupines.

351
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:35,750
You know, guys, this isn't
my first time in a tree.

352
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,417
One time,
I got stuck in one.

353
00:17:37,417 --> 00:17:39,291
You did? Do tell.

354
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:42,625
STINKY: What? My dad
was stuck in a tree?

355
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:44,458
CLAUDETTE:
I wanna hear this!

356
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:47,792
Okay. Me and Uncle Mooch
and Shakey were
out wolfing around,

357
00:17:47,792 --> 00:17:50,500
and I was about to put
the moves on Kate.

358
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,834
Humphrey,
you're talking
to the pups.

359
00:17:52,834 --> 00:17:54,625
Oh, yeah.

360
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:59,250
Well, uh, I was going
to ask Kate out
on a date, uh, but...

361
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,792
Friends for life.

362
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,667
Whoa.

363
00:18:10,417 --> 00:18:12,834
LILLY:
So, do you see Garth?

364
00:18:12,834 --> 00:18:14,208
Great.

365
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:16,834
I'm not even sure
what he looks like.

366
00:18:16,834 --> 00:18:18,333
But I'm sure...

367
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,125
We'll know him
when we see him.

368
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,000
Hey, hey, Kate.

369
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,125
What?

370
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:33,166
Uh, Garth...
Wow.

371
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:35,000
Lilly, stand up.

372
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,333
Garth?

373
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:37,542
Hello.

374
00:18:37,542 --> 00:18:39,500
Good to see you.

375
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,250
Humphrey?
Oh, my butt, my butt.
That really hurt.

376
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,500
Wow, Dad, sounds
like you crushed it.

377
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,834
Hold on.

378
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,583
Another burrow!

379
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:53,333
Now, we've been combing
this forest all afternoon

380
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,291
and not one sign
of a wolf.

381
00:18:57,542 --> 00:19:00,709
Kate, get ready
to take the pups
to the train, okay?

382
00:19:00,709 --> 00:19:02,750
What are you going
to do, Humphrey?

383
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,208
I'm going
to distract them.

384
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:05,542
Distract them?

385
00:19:05,542 --> 00:19:07,542
Get ready, Kate,
and no matter what,

386
00:19:07,542 --> 00:19:10,208
get the pups
to the train!

387
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,166
There they are!

388
00:19:34,917 --> 00:19:37,709
Dad is awesome,
we can't leave him.

389
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:41,166
Yes, Stinky,
he is amazing.
He'll make it.

390
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,250
Your dad always makes it.

391
00:19:44,542 --> 00:19:46,500
Don't shoot, Jethro,
don't shoot.

392
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,917
You're a lousy dang shot!

393
00:19:47,917 --> 00:19:49,375
JETHRO:
Whoa, whoa!
Hey, hey, hey!

394
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,667
Oh, man! Come on!

395
00:20:03,917 --> 00:20:05,417
GRIFFIN: Oh!

396
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:09,750
Okay, guys, this way!

397
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,458
What the heck?

398
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:14,625
Did you see that?

399
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,583
The whole forest
dang attacked us!

400
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:20,750
There they are!

401
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,959
Fleet!

402
00:20:33,417 --> 00:20:36,041
Brent, my best bro!

403
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:38,750
Agnes, my homegirl!

404
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,458
Fran, Frieda, you came!

405
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:43,291
Of course,
you're our king.

406
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,208
MARCEL: Sacrebleu!

407
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:54,500
It's Noah's Ark.

408
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,000
More like Noah's train.

409
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,208
We're taking the train
to the border.

410
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:00,542
How long till
an open box car?

411
00:21:00,542 --> 00:21:01,875
Very soon.

412
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,333
Uh, 10 cars down.

413
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,083
You're all
taking the train?

414
00:21:06,834 --> 00:21:08,834
Okay, Brent,
grab the porcupines.

415
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:12,208
Everyone, here it comes.
When I say "now,"

416
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:14,125
we jump into the open car.

417
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,166
GRIFFIN: There they are!

418
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:18,375
Okay, aim!

419
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:19,834
KATE: Just a bit more.

420
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:23,959
Get them off!

421
00:21:23,959 --> 00:21:25,208
Now!

422
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:41,542
What... We were
attacked by birds?

423
00:21:41,542 --> 00:21:45,583
It's like every animal
in the dang forest
is protecting them!

424
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:48,375
You say "dang" a lot,
you know that, right?

425
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:53,417
Come on, everyone,
hug it out.

426
00:21:53,417 --> 00:21:55,000
Bro.
Bro.

427
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,375
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

428
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:59,208
Hey.
Hey.

429
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:00,542
HUMPHREY: Hey!

430
00:22:06,417 --> 00:22:07,750
BOTH: No.

431
00:22:17,542 --> 00:22:18,750
BRENT: Wow.

432
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,792
I'm usually more
of a river person,

433
00:22:20,792 --> 00:22:22,750
but that is sweet!

434
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:26,083
Humphrey and I fell
in love right here.

435
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:28,417
I finally got Kate
to howl with me.

436
00:22:28,417 --> 00:22:32,458
Humphrey,
you had me at "howl-lo."

437
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:36,458
Is that
wolf speak for
falling in love?

438
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:38,375
Well, what do
you think it is?

439
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:41,208
It's like when
you had the hots
for that woodchuck.

440
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:42,875
He had a nice smile.

441
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:45,083
That wasn't
a smile, sister.

442
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:48,125
Like, a woodchuck's teeth
always stick out like that.

443
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:51,125
Kate, let's make
this moment last.

444
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:52,417
BRENT: I have to pee.

445
00:22:53,959 --> 00:22:55,291
I have to pee.

446
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,083
O-M-G.

Is this for real?

452
00:23:17,917 --> 00:23:20,500
Well, I can't say
I haven't had my own
tinkle time-outs.

453
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:26,583
What's wrong with you?
I have to go.

454
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:28,959
You can't leave.
Can't you hold it?

455
00:23:28,959 --> 00:23:30,208
No! I Can't!

456
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,333
Well, did you try
crossing your legs?

457
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:33,792
Yes!
Holding your breath?

458
00:23:33,792 --> 00:23:35,500
Yes! I almost passed out!

459
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,375
Closing your eyes and...
In or out, I am going.

460
00:23:41,542 --> 00:23:43,375
Would you hurry?

461
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:44,959
I can't go when
I feel pressured.

462
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:46,208
Go!

463
00:24:01,291 --> 00:24:03,625
Come on, let's help him.
One more time.

464
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:05,959
ALL:
♪ There was a little stream

465
00:24:05,959 --> 00:24:08,291

00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,500
Okay, so you have a few
more suns till the border.

469
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,875
We'll keep an eye
out for planes.

470
00:24:38,417 --> 00:24:40,375
Okay, Stinky's got
the best sense of smell

471
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:42,750
so give him your food order
and he'll find what you want.

472
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:45,333
Okay, wait up.

473
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:47,208
I'm smelling moose.

474
00:24:47,208 --> 00:24:49,875
Stinky,
we could co-hunt it!

475
00:24:51,709 --> 00:24:54,291
No, Brent, we've got enough
problems with the hunters.

476
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:55,959
We don't need
antlers in the party.

477
00:24:55,959 --> 00:25:00,500
Besides, Humphrey doesn't
like moose that much.

478
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,583
I kind of had
a run in with one.

479
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:05,083
Cool. Did you
take it down?

480
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:08,917
Did you go for
the hind quarters,
Mr. Humphrey?

481
00:25:08,917 --> 00:25:10,166
Did you

482
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:12,083
Go for the hind quarters?

483
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:14,667
Ah, in a sense.

484
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:16,959
Oh, my goodness,
look out for the...

485
00:25:18,542 --> 00:25:19,792
Oh, no! No, no, no!

486
00:25:19,792 --> 00:25:22,291
Oh, he's a goner for sure.

487
00:25:33,625 --> 00:25:37,750
HUMPHREY: It was horrible.
He had this wide stance.

488
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,083
I had to go
into counseling.

489
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:40,417
Oh.

490
00:25:41,792 --> 00:25:44,291
Hi. And he looked
just like that guy.

491
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:48,250
Wait, it wasn't you,
was it?

492
00:25:50,917 --> 00:25:52,667
Oh, my gosh, it was!

493
00:25:52,667 --> 00:25:54,417
What is it?

494
00:25:55,291 --> 00:25:56,959
Wolf trappers.

495
00:25:59,667 --> 00:26:01,291
Son, are you okay?

496
00:26:14,291 --> 00:26:15,458
Okay, wolves,

497
00:26:15,458 --> 00:26:16,959
there is a human road
to the right.

498
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:19,166
You need to run to that.
Human road?

499
00:26:19,166 --> 00:26:21,834
Yes, they can't shoot
where there are humans!

500
00:26:21,834 --> 00:26:23,792
Okay, now!

501
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:25,125
PADDY: Do hurry!

502
00:27:18,834 --> 00:27:20,166
We can't keep going.

503
00:27:20,166 --> 00:27:21,583
He could really
hurt himself.

504
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:24,709
It's just a sprain.

505
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:27,375
It'll heal, but not if
he keeps walking on it.

506
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:28,875
Oh, no.

507
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:30,375
Humphrey,
we gotta hide.

508
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:41,542
STINKY: Hey, Mom, Dad,
Runt and the porcupines
are gone?

509
00:27:41,542 --> 00:27:43,208
KATE: What?
Are you sure?

510
00:27:43,208 --> 00:27:45,208
I'm sure.
They must have
slipped out!

511
00:27:45,208 --> 00:27:46,583
HUMPHREY:
Quiet everyone.

512
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:04,458
Here, wolfy, wolfy.
Come on.

513
00:28:04,458 --> 00:28:06,750
Jethro's not
gonna hurt you.

514
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,375
I'm just moving you.

515
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:13,250
What the heck is that?
Sounds like a...

516
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:14,417
It's coming closer.

517
00:28:14,417 --> 00:28:16,959
What the heck?
It's a monster!

518
00:28:16,959 --> 00:28:18,291
Run! Run!

519
00:28:18,291 --> 00:28:20,083
Run!

520
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:40,792
Sorry,
I saw an opening
and I took it.

521
00:28:40,792 --> 00:28:43,792
Now, you know why
we call him the
king of the forest.

522
00:28:43,792 --> 00:28:46,792
Well, let's give it up
for the porcupines.

523
00:28:52,583 --> 00:28:54,959
We have to find
another way across
the border.

524
00:28:54,959 --> 00:28:56,625
We've already
done the trains.

525
00:28:56,625 --> 00:29:00,959
Uh, don't wanna do planes,
so how about automobiles?

526
00:29:00,959 --> 00:29:02,750
You remember,
like last time.

527
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:05,917
That was no auto,
that was a party bus.

528
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:09,667
Humphrey?

529
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:28,875
Ha-ha! Whoo!

530
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,500
Yeah, you didn't know
Papa was a Rolling Stone,
did you?

531
00:29:42,166 --> 00:29:44,875
You... You don't
get that reference,
do you? Okay.

532
00:29:44,875 --> 00:29:48,667
Now, let us do
a fly over and see what
we can come up with.

533
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:57,250
MARCEL: Well, what does
every family vacation need?

534
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:01,041
An RV!
Recognize it?

535
00:30:01,041 --> 00:30:04,875
Kate, this is
the same camper
we took last time.

536
00:30:04,875 --> 00:30:06,917
Uh, yes,
the same one,

537
00:30:06,917 --> 00:30:09,083
but this time from
Jasper back to Idaho.

538
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:12,083
How do you two know
everyone's travel patterns?

539
00:30:12,083 --> 00:30:15,291
Oh, we have a way
of marking vehicles.

540
00:30:15,291 --> 00:30:17,375
Specifically windshields.

541
00:30:17,375 --> 00:30:21,709
Now, humans think
it's random,
but it's not.

542
00:30:30,041 --> 00:30:31,542
What is she doing?

543
00:30:31,542 --> 00:30:34,000
Her biker boyfriend left her
and now she's a bit lonely.

544
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,959
So some cousins
of ours have become
her new best friends.

545
00:30:37,959 --> 00:30:39,291
Cousins?

546
00:30:40,709 --> 00:30:42,208
Oh, gosh.

547
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,125
Oh, no.

548
00:30:46,125 --> 00:30:47,417
What now?

549
00:30:47,417 --> 00:30:49,125
Oh, no!

550
00:30:50,667 --> 00:30:52,917
Brent,
what are you doing?

551
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:55,750
Uh, he's got bird issues.

552
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,083
Bird issues?

553
00:30:57,083 --> 00:31:00,250
They're not birds,
they are monsters!

554
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:01,583
You want a piece of me?

555
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:03,458
CLAUDETTE: Order!
Order on the field!

556
00:31:03,458 --> 00:31:05,917
Where did it go?

557
00:31:05,917 --> 00:31:07,709
I hear it over there.

558
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:11,166
Tweet, tweet, tweet.

559
00:31:11,166 --> 00:31:14,250
Oh, look, it's a cub.

560
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:15,917
Let's flutter around
his nose.

561
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:17,166
Brent, time out!

562
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,500
BOTH: Ow!

563
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:23,000
I still hear it!

564
00:31:25,834 --> 00:31:28,333
Oh, no.

565
00:31:28,333 --> 00:31:31,166
(WOMAN SPEAKING
INDISTINCTLY)

566
00:31:37,959 --> 00:31:40,125
What the heck?

567
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,583
Oh!

568
00:31:46,291 --> 00:31:48,250
STINKY:
Oh, no! She died.

569
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:50,291
Poor, poor lady.

570
00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:51,750
What do we do?

571
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:54,125
I'm so sorry.

572
00:31:54,125 --> 00:31:58,000
Agnes,
this is your guy's fault.

573
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,834
Yeah, I know.
I'm under a lot of stress.

574
00:32:00,834 --> 00:32:02,333
I'm a stress eater!

575
00:32:04,166 --> 00:32:06,125
I mean, we, like,
killed her!

576
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:07,667
How am I going
to live with myself?

577
00:32:07,667 --> 00:32:11,291
I mean, we're vegans!
We don't kill!

578
00:32:11,291 --> 00:32:13,667
I'm so sorry.

579
00:32:13,667 --> 00:32:15,041
Ah!

580
00:32:16,625 --> 00:32:18,500
That feels good.

581
00:32:23,333 --> 00:32:27,125
Hi there,
you little cuties, you.

582
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:29,917
Oh, I see it's, uh,

583
00:32:29,917 --> 00:32:33,792
a sort of a family.

584
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:37,458
Wolves, bear, porcupines,

585
00:32:37,458 --> 00:32:39,333
and fowl?

586
00:32:51,208 --> 00:32:54,041
Okay, we hit
the mother lode.

587
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:55,542
Served in a bowl, too.

588
00:32:56,417 --> 00:32:58,542
O-M-G, its china.

589
00:32:58,542 --> 00:33:00,834
I mean, that's class.

590
00:33:13,333 --> 00:33:15,542
Hi.
Sorry to bother you,

591
00:33:15,542 --> 00:33:18,750
but we're animal trappers
and we're looking for wolves.

592
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,333
Relocating the dang things.

593
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:22,208
Well, I'm no wolf,

594
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:26,417
but I have been
called a fox in
my time.

595
00:33:28,917 --> 00:33:30,083
So no wolves?

596
00:33:30,083 --> 00:33:31,542
Nah.

597
00:33:33,834 --> 00:33:37,125
Hmm. Got pets, huh?

598
00:33:37,125 --> 00:33:39,917
Oh, yes. Oh, well,

599
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:41,583
thanks for stopping by.

600
00:33:41,583 --> 00:33:43,542
I'll keep my eyes peeled.

601
00:33:52,291 --> 00:33:56,375
Well, what're we
gonna do with you?

602
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:07,458
Uh... You wanna go
inside the camper?

603
00:34:08,834 --> 00:34:11,917
You want to
hide in the camper.

604
00:34:12,959 --> 00:34:16,333
You want to drive the truck?

605
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:20,250
You want me
to drive the truck?

606
00:34:21,458 --> 00:34:23,000
Oh, well,

607
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,417
the only place
I was planning on
driving to was Idaho.

608
00:34:27,417 --> 00:34:30,667
Idaho...
Oh, I get it!

609
00:34:30,667 --> 00:34:33,250
They wouldn't be looking
for wolves there.

610
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,834
Pull over!

611
00:34:50,166 --> 00:34:51,500
Pull over!

612
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,583
Now run.

613
00:35:22,583 --> 00:35:24,792
Run towards the mountains.

614
00:35:24,792 --> 00:35:27,667
Come on now!
I'll miss you all.

615
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:13,458
Where are they?
I don't know.

616
00:36:13,458 --> 00:36:16,291
They just have
to set a paw on this
golfing green

617
00:36:16,291 --> 00:36:18,375
and they're officially
in Idaho.

618
00:36:21,625 --> 00:36:24,125
Okay, everyone,
spin to the left.

619
00:36:26,709 --> 00:36:29,750
I gotta do something.
Get our pups out of here.

620
00:36:31,917 --> 00:36:33,208
What is Dad doing?

621
00:36:33,208 --> 00:36:35,125
He'll be okay.

622
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,959
Now, welcome to Idaho!

623
00:36:44,959 --> 00:36:46,250
Where is Humphrey?

624
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:48,959
We were being shot at,
he wanted to divert them.

625
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,750
Marcel, Paddy, watch them.

626
00:37:04,417 --> 00:37:07,625
Uh... Is Dad okay?
Is he?

627
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:09,834
He's the best dad
in the world.

628
00:37:09,834 --> 00:37:13,166
And Mom, she might
be in danger, too.

629
00:37:13,166 --> 00:37:15,125
What if they are taken?

630
00:37:15,125 --> 00:37:19,333
Oh, please...
Please let them make
it past one more...

631
00:37:19,333 --> 00:37:21,125
One more disaster.

632
00:37:21,125 --> 00:37:25,792
Don't let this
be the last drama
for the drama wolves.

633
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,959
Look, everyone!

634
00:37:57,875 --> 00:38:01,125
KATE: Well, wasn't exactly
the route we wanted...

635
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:04,208
HUMPHREY:
But, here we are,
Alfred Creek Falls.

636
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,709
HUMPHREY:
So, how was our first
family vacation, guys?

637
00:38:16,709 --> 00:38:18,542
STINKY: Awesome!
RUNT: The best!

638
00:38:18,542 --> 00:38:20,125
Yeah, let's do it again.
CLAUDETTE:
 Awesome!

639
00:38:20,125 --> 00:38:21,709
RUNT:
Can we do it again?
Can we do it again?

640
00:38:21,709 --> 00:38:23,041
BRENT: Can I come
along next year?

641
00:38:23,041 --> 00:38:24,417
Please?

642
00:38:24,417 --> 00:38:25,917
STINKY: You know what
we're missing now?

643
00:38:25,917 --> 00:38:27,583
HUMPHREY:
Oh, what's that, son?

644
00:38:27,583 --> 00:38:31,041
STINKY: Your famous
animal impressions.

645
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:33,208
CLAUDETTE: Okay,
let's hear it, Dad.

646
00:38:33,208 --> 00:38:35,041
RUNT: Yeah, surprise us.

647
00:38:35,041 --> 00:38:36,625
BRENT: Come on, Mr. Humphrey.

648
00:38:36,625 --> 00:38:37,875
AGNES: This I gotta hear.

649
00:38:37,875 --> 00:38:39,375
KATE: Humphrey,
pressure's on.

650
00:38:39,375 --> 00:38:41,500
HUMPHREY: Okay. All right,
you ready for this?

651
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,166
ALL: Ready!
