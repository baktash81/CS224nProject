1
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:30,094
<i>Although each of the world's countries</i>

2
00:00:30,205 --> 00:00:31,433
<i>would like to dispute this fact,</i>

3
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:32,972
<i>we French know the truth:</i>

4
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:35,304
<i>The best food in the world</i>
<i>is made in France.</i>

5
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,469
<i>The best food in France</i>
<i>is made in Paris.</i>

6
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:42,073
<i>And the best food in Paris, some say,</i>
<i>is made by Chef Auguste Gusteau.</i>

7
00:00:42,183 --> 00:00:44,549
<i>Gusteau's restaurant</i>
<i>is the toast of Paris,</i>

8
00:00:44,652 --> 00:00:46,279
<i>booked five months in advance.</i>

9
00:00:46,388 --> 00:00:49,118
<i>And his dazzling ascent</i>
<i>to the top of fine French cuisine</i>

10
00:00:49,224 --> 00:00:51,556
<i>has made his competitors envious.</i>

11
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:54,958
<i>He is the youngest chef ever</i>
<i>to achieve a five-star rating.</i>

12
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:57,223
<i>Chef Gusteau's cookbook,</i>
Anyone Can Cook!

13
00:00:57,332 --> 00:00:59,459
<i>Climbed to the top of the bestseller list.</i>

14
00:00:59,561 --> 00:01:01,865
<i>But not everyone</i>
<i>celebrates its success.</i>

15
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,871
<i>Amusing title,</i> Anyone Can Cook!

16
00:01:04,973 --> 00:01:08,670
<i>What's even more amusing is that</i>
<i>Gusteau actually seems to believe it.</i>

17
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:11,268
<i>I, on the other hand,</i>
<i>take cooking seriously.</i>

18
00:01:11,379 --> 00:01:15,145
<i>And, no, I don't think anyone can do it.</i>

19
00:01:53,421 --> 00:01:55,412
<i>This is me.</i>

20
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:59,226
<i>I think it's apparent</i>
<i>I need to rethink my life a little bit.</i>

21
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:00,919
<i>What's my problem?</i>

22
00:02:01,029 --> 00:02:02,963
<i>First of all, I'm a rat.</i>

23
00:02:05,033 --> 00:02:07,524
<i>Which means life is hard.</i>

24
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:13,104
<i>And second, I have a highly developed</i>
<i>sense of taste and smell.</i>

25
00:02:14,542 --> 00:02:18,876
Flour, eggs, sugar, vanilla bean...

26
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,141
Oh! Small twist of lemon.

27
00:02:21,249 --> 00:02:24,878
Whoa, you can smell all that?
You have a gift.

28
00:02:24,986 --> 00:02:28,422
<i>This is Emile, my brother.</i>
<i>He's easily impressed.</i>

29
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:32,084
So you can smell ingredients?
So what?

30
00:02:32,327 --> 00:02:35,262
<i>This is my dad. He's never impressed.</i>

31
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:38,598
<i>He also happens to be</i>
<i>the leader of our clan.</i>

32
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:42,166
<i>So, what's wrong</i>
<i>with having highly developed senses?</i>

33
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:46,400
- Don't eat that!
- What's going on here?

34
00:02:46,975 --> 00:02:50,411
<i>Turns out that funny smell</i>
<i>was rat poison.</i>

35
00:02:50,512 --> 00:02:53,879
<i>Suddenly, Dad didn't think</i>
<i>my talent was useless.</i>

36
00:02:53,982 --> 00:02:56,450
<i>I was feeling pretty good about my gift,</i>

37
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,951
<i>until Dad gave me a job.</i>

38
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:00,684
Clean.

39
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:02,022
Clean.

40
00:03:02,157 --> 00:03:03,522
<i>That's right. Poison checker.</i>

41
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:04,751
Cleanerific.

42
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,360
Cleanerino.

43
00:03:06,828 --> 00:03:08,557
Close to godliness.

44
00:03:09,497 --> 00:03:13,797
Which means clean.
You know, cleanliness is close to...

45
00:03:14,035 --> 00:03:15,764
Never mind. Move on.

46
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:18,372
<i>Well, it made my dad proud.</i>

47
00:03:18,473 --> 00:03:23,069
Now, don't you feel better, Remy?
You've helped a noble cause.

48
00:03:23,178 --> 00:03:25,738
Noble? We're thieves, Dad.

49
00:03:25,847 --> 00:03:29,442
And what we're stealing is,
let's face it, garbage.

50
00:03:29,551 --> 00:03:31,542
It isn't stealing if no one wants it.

51
00:03:31,653 --> 00:03:34,144
If no one wants it,
why are we stealing it?

52
00:03:35,356 --> 00:03:37,221
<i>Let's just say</i>
<i>we have different points of view.</i>

53
00:03:38,326 --> 00:03:39,816
<i>This much I knew:</i>

54
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:43,864
<i>If you are what you eat,</i>
<i>then I only want to eat the good stuff.</i>

55
00:03:44,032 --> 00:03:45,499
<i>But to my dad...</i>

56
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,726
Food is fuel.

57
00:03:46,834 --> 00:03:50,463
You get picky about what you put
in the tank, your engine is gonna die.

58
00:03:50,572 --> 00:03:52,130
Now shut up and eat your garbage.

59
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,730
Look, if we're going to be thieves,

60
00:03:53,841 --> 00:03:55,706
why not steal the good stuff
in the kitchen,

61
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,402
where nothing is poisoned?

62
00:03:57,512 --> 00:04:00,072
First of all, we are not thieves.

63
00:04:00,181 --> 00:04:03,048
Secondly, stay out of the kitchen
and away from the humans.

64
00:04:03,151 --> 00:04:04,345
It's dangerous.

65
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,181
<i>I know</i>
<i>I'm supposed to hate humans,</i>

66
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:08,312
<i>but there's something about them.</i>

67
00:04:08,423 --> 00:04:12,792
<i>They don't just survive.</i>
<i>They discover, they create.</i>

68
00:04:13,161 --> 00:04:15,322
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>just look at what they do with food.</i>

69
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,920
<i>GUS TEAU ON TV:</i>
<i>How can I describe it?</i>

70
00:04:17,031 --> 00:04:20,990
<i>Good food is like music you can taste,</i>
<i>color you can smell.</i>

71
00:04:21,102 --> 00:04:23,570
<i>There is excellence all around you.</i>

72
00:04:23,671 --> 00:04:27,198
<i>You need only be aware to stop</i>
<i>and savor it.</i>

73
00:04:31,112 --> 00:04:33,307
<i>Oh, Gusteau was right.</i>

74
00:04:33,581 --> 00:04:36,141
<i>Oh, mmm, yeah.</i>

75
00:04:36,551 --> 00:04:38,143
<i>Oh, amazing.</i>

76
00:04:38,853 --> 00:04:42,016
<i>Each flavor was totally unique.</i>

77
00:04:46,094 --> 00:04:49,291
<i>But combine one flavor with another,</i>

78
00:04:49,397 --> 00:04:52,161
<i>and something new was created.</i>

79
00:04:57,872 --> 00:05:00,363
<i>So now I had a secret life.</i>

80
00:05:08,216 --> 00:05:10,776
<i>The only one who knew about it</i>
<i>was Emile.</i>

81
00:05:11,085 --> 00:05:13,280
Hey, Emile. Emile.

82
00:05:13,621 --> 00:05:15,612
I found a mushroom.

83
00:05:15,723 --> 00:05:19,056
Come on, you're good at hiding food.
Help me find a good place to put this.

84
00:05:19,494 --> 00:05:22,588
<i>He doesn't understand me,</i>
<i>but I can be myself around him.</i>

85
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,426
Why are you walking like that?

86
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:27,501
I don't want to constantly
have to wash my paws.

87
00:05:27,602 --> 00:05:29,661
Did you ever think about how we walk
on the same paws

88
00:05:29,771 --> 00:05:30,965
that we handle food with?

89
00:05:31,072 --> 00:05:33,131
You ever think about
what we put into our mouths?

90
00:05:33,241 --> 00:05:34,299
All the time.

91
00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:36,969
When I eat, I don't want to taste
everywhere my paws have been.

92
00:05:37,078 --> 00:05:38,204
Well, go ahead.

93
00:05:38,313 --> 00:05:40,907
But if Dad sees you walking like that,
he's not going to like it.

94
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,981
What have you got there?

95
00:05:46,754 --> 00:05:48,449
You found cheese?

96
00:05:48,956 --> 00:05:53,290
And not just any cheese.
Tomme de chÃ¨vre de pays!

97
00:05:53,494 --> 00:05:55,985
That would go beautifully
with my mushroom.

98
00:05:56,097 --> 00:05:57,064
And...

99
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,497
This rosemary! This rosemary

100
00:06:02,603 --> 00:06:06,266
with maybe with a few drops
from this sweet grass.

101
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,733
Well, throw it on the pile, I guess,
and then we'll... You know...

102
00:06:09,844 --> 00:06:14,247
We don't want to throw this in
with the garbage. This is special.

103
00:06:14,349 --> 00:06:15,976
But we're supposed
to return to the colony

104
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,642
before sundown or,
you know, Dad's gonna...

105
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:18,776
Emile!

106
00:06:18,886 --> 00:06:20,786
There are possibilities
unexplored here.

107
00:06:20,888 --> 00:06:22,378
We got to cook this.

108
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:26,950
Now, exactly how we cook this
is the real question...

109
00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:29,196
Yeah.

110
00:06:29,897 --> 00:06:32,161
The key is to keep turning it.

111
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:35,667
Get the smoky flavor nice and even.

112
00:06:36,904 --> 00:06:39,099
That storm's getting closer.

113
00:06:39,407 --> 00:06:44,106
Hey, Remy, you think that maybe
we shouldn't be so...

114
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,424
You got to taste this!

115
00:06:57,525 --> 00:07:01,825
This is... It's got this kind of...
It's burny, melty...

116
00:07:01,929 --> 00:07:04,796
It's not really a smoky taste.
It's a certain... It's kind of like a...

117
00:07:06,033 --> 00:07:09,935
It's got, like, this "ba-boom, zap"
kind of taste. Don't you think?

118
00:07:10,037 --> 00:07:13,234
- What would you call that flavor?
- Lightning-y?

119
00:07:13,508 --> 00:07:17,968
Yeah. It's lightning-y!
We got to do that again.

120
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:20,741
Okay, when the next storm comes,
we'll go up on the roof...

121
00:07:20,848 --> 00:07:24,284
I know what this needs! Saffron!
A little saffron would make this!

122
00:07:24,385 --> 00:07:26,910
Saffron. Why do I get the feeling

123
00:07:27,021 --> 00:07:28,955
- it's in the kitchen?
- It's in the kitchen.

124
00:07:35,897 --> 00:07:38,024
Saffron.
- Not good.

125
00:07:38,132 --> 00:07:39,599
Saffron.

126
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:43,568
Don't like it. She's gonna wake up.

127
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,104
I've been down here a million times.

128
00:07:45,206 --> 00:07:48,369
She turns on the cooking channel,
boom, she never wakes up.

129
00:07:48,476 --> 00:07:50,467
You've been here a million times?

130
00:07:50,578 --> 00:07:54,115
I'm telling you, saffron will be
just the thing. Gusteau swears by it.

131
00:07:54,382 --> 00:07:56,179
Okay. Who's Gusteau?

132
00:07:56,284 --> 00:07:59,549
Just the greatest chef in the world.
Wrote this cookbook.

133
00:07:59,654 --> 00:08:02,521
Wait. You read?

134
00:08:02,623 --> 00:08:07,424
- Well, not excessively.
- Oh, man. Does Dad know?

135
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:12,124
You could fill a book, a lot
of books, with things Dad doesn't know.

136
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:16,363
And they have, which is why I read.
Which is also our secret.

137
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:17,936
I don't like secrets.

138
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:21,873
All this cooking
and reading and TV-watching

139
00:08:21,976 --> 00:08:24,274
while we read and cook.

140
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:27,472
It's like you're involving me in crime,
and I let you.

141
00:08:27,582 --> 00:08:28,981
Why do I let you?

142
00:08:33,654 --> 00:08:35,713
What's taking those kids so long?

143
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:39,817
Ah, I'Aquila saffron. Italian. Huh?

144
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:43,656
Gusteau says it's excellent.
Good thing the old lady is a food love...

145
00:08:43,764 --> 00:08:46,426
<i>Forget mystique.</i>
<i>This is about your cooking.</i>

146
00:08:46,534 --> 00:08:49,002
Hey! That's Gusteau. Emile, look.

147
00:08:49,136 --> 00:08:50,383
<i>Great cooking</i>
<i>is not for the faint of heart.</i>

148
00:08:50,418 --> 00:08:51,631
<i>Great cooking</i>
<i>is not for the faint of heart.</i>

149
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:54,367
<i>You must be imaginative,</i>
<i>strong hearted.</i>

150
00:08:54,475 --> 00:08:56,534
<i>You must try things that may not work.</i>

151
00:08:56,644 --> 00:08:58,737
<i>And you must not let anyone</i>
<i>define your limits</i>

152
00:08:58,846 --> 00:09:00,973
<i>because of where you come from.</i>

153
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,346
<i>Your only limit is your soul.</i>

154
00:09:03,451 --> 00:09:10,414
<i>What I say is true. Anyone can cook.</i>
<i>But only the fearless can be great.</i>

155
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,490
Pure poetry.

156
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,618
<i>But it was not to last.</i>

157
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:17,896
<i>Gusteau's restaurant lost</i>
<i>one of its five stars</i>

158
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:22,663
<i>after a scathing review</i>
<i>by France's top food critic, Anton Ego.</i>

159
00:09:23,237 --> 00:09:25,364
<i>It was a severe blow to Gusteau,</i>

160
00:09:25,473 --> 00:09:28,499
<i>and the brokenhearted chef</i>
<i>died shortly afterwards,</i>

161
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:32,705
<i>which, according to tradition,</i>
<i>meant the loss of another star.</i>

162
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,313
Gusteau is dead?

163
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:50,724
Run!

164
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,394
No, you'll lead her to the colony!

165
00:10:14,355 --> 00:10:15,870
- Help, Remy, help!
- Emile! Start swinging the light!

166
00:10:15,905 --> 00:10:17,385
- Help, Remy, help!
- Emile! Start swinging the light!

167
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,093
Try to grab you.

168
00:10:24,565 --> 00:10:26,396
Emile, swing to me.

169
00:11:00,134 --> 00:11:03,570
Evacuate! Everyone, to the boats.

170
00:11:07,642 --> 00:11:09,442
Let me through!
- The book.

171
00:11:09,477 --> 00:11:10,171
Let me through!
- The book.

172
00:11:11,445 --> 00:11:13,640
Excuse me. Move, move.

173
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,990
Go, go, go, go. Move, move, move.

174
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,869
Get the bridge up! Move it, move it!

175
00:11:36,537 --> 00:11:37,970
Hey, Johnny! Hurry!

176
00:11:38,172 --> 00:11:39,662
Push off. Come on.

177
00:11:40,675 --> 00:11:41,835
Get hold!

178
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:48,480
- Take the baby. Here!
- Give me your paw.

179
00:11:49,517 --> 00:11:51,109
Hey, wait for me!

180
00:11:56,057 --> 00:11:58,184
Is everybody here?
Do we have everybody?

181
00:11:58,292 --> 00:12:00,852
- Wait a minute. Where's Remy?
- Right here. I'm coming.

182
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:02,760
I'm coming!

183
00:12:03,631 --> 00:12:06,623
Hold on, Son.
Give him something to grab on to.

184
00:12:06,801 --> 00:12:08,792
Come on, boy. Paddle, Son.

185
00:12:08,903 --> 00:12:10,837
Come on. Reach for it.

186
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,000
You can do it.

187
00:12:17,178 --> 00:12:18,668
- Remy!
- Dad!

188
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,509
Come on. You can make it.
You can make it.

189
00:12:27,521 --> 00:12:29,455
Guys, wait. Stop!

190
00:12:29,557 --> 00:12:31,616
Remy. Come on. Paddle.

191
00:12:31,726 --> 00:12:35,389
Hold on! Wait for me. Hold on.

192
00:12:38,032 --> 00:12:39,260
Dad?

193
00:12:42,403 --> 00:12:43,370
Dad?

194
00:12:54,215 --> 00:12:55,705
Which way?

195
00:13:46,233 --> 00:13:47,668
<i>I waited</i>

196
00:13:50,104 --> 00:13:51,571
<i>for a sound,</i>

197
00:13:53,974 --> 00:13:55,464
<i>a voice,</i>

198
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:59,235
<i>a sign,</i>

199
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:03,082
<i>something.</i>

200
00:14:21,936 --> 00:14:25,702
If you are hungry,
go up and look around, Remy.

201
00:14:27,975 --> 00:14:30,034
Why do you wait and mope?

202
00:14:30,477 --> 00:14:34,743
Well, I've just lost my family,
all my friends,

203
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,383
probably forever.

204
00:14:37,818 --> 00:14:40,548
- How do you know?
- Well, I...

205
00:14:41,222 --> 00:14:44,953
You are an illustration.
Why am I talking to you?

206
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:49,858
Well, you just lost your family,
all your friends. You are lonely.

207
00:14:49,964 --> 00:14:52,159
Yeah. Well, you're dead.

208
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:55,599
Ah, but that is no match
for wishful thinking.

209
00:14:55,703 --> 00:14:57,432
If you focus on what you've left behind,

210
00:14:57,538 --> 00:14:59,904
you'll never be able to see
what lies ahead.

211
00:15:00,007 --> 00:15:02,202
Now go up and look around.

212
00:15:39,346 --> 00:15:40,506
Champagne!

213
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,008
What are you doing?

214
00:15:44,218 --> 00:15:45,344
I'm hungry.

215
00:15:45,552 --> 00:15:46,951
I don't know where I am,

216
00:15:47,054 --> 00:15:48,749
and I don't know
when I'll find food again.

217
00:15:48,856 --> 00:15:52,451
Remy, you are better than that.
You are a cook.

218
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:57,563
A cook makes. A thief takes.
You are not a thief.

219
00:15:58,232 --> 00:15:59,893
But I am hungry.

220
00:16:01,602 --> 00:16:03,263
Food will come, Remy.

221
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:07,932
Food always comes
to those who love to cook.

222
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,318
- You think I am playing?
- You don't have the guts.

223
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:10,863
Paris?

224
00:17:11,472 --> 00:17:14,964
All this time
I've been underneath Paris?

225
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,271
Wow.

226
00:17:20,981 --> 00:17:22,676
It's beautiful.

227
00:17:23,884 --> 00:17:26,478
The most beautiful.

228
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,414
Gusteau's? Your restaurant?

229
00:17:29,523 --> 00:17:31,957
You've led me to your restaurant.

230
00:17:33,027 --> 00:17:38,226
It seems as though I have. Yes.
There it is! I have led you to it!

231
00:17:38,332 --> 00:17:39,697
I got to see this.

232
00:17:40,367 --> 00:17:41,925
Ready to go on table seven.
Coming around.

233
00:17:42,036 --> 00:17:43,731
One order of steamed pike up.
Coming up.

234
00:17:43,837 --> 00:17:45,566
I need
more soup bowls, please.

235
00:17:45,672 --> 00:17:48,266
I need two rack of lamb.
I need more leeks.

236
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:51,640
I need two salmon, three
salade composÃ©e, and three filet.

237
00:17:51,745 --> 00:17:53,645
Three orders
of salade composÃ©e working.

238
00:17:53,747 --> 00:17:55,442
Firing two orders, seared salmon.

239
00:17:55,549 --> 00:17:57,918
Three filet working. I need plates.

240
00:17:58,185 --> 00:18:00,847
Fire seven.
Three salade composÃ©e up.

241
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,854
Don't mess with my mise!

242
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:04,182
Open down low.

243
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:07,226
I'm getting buried here.

244
00:18:07,394 --> 00:18:10,090
Hello, Chef Skinner.
How your night be now?

245
00:18:10,197 --> 00:18:12,222
<i>Bonjour,</i> chef.
Hello, Chef Skinner.

246
00:18:12,332 --> 00:18:14,823
- Evening, chef.
Ordering <i>deux</i> filet.

247
00:18:14,935 --> 00:18:16,800
Hey, boss, look who is here.

248
00:18:16,904 --> 00:18:19,304
Alfredo Linguini, Renata's little boy.

249
00:18:19,406 --> 00:18:21,033
- Hi.
- All grown up, eh?

250
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:23,666
You remember Renata,
Gusteau's old flame?

251
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:28,106
- Yes. How are you...
- Linguini.

252
00:18:28,215 --> 00:18:32,413
Yes, Linguini. So nice of you to visit.
How is...

253
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:34,350
- My mother?
- Renata.

254
00:18:34,455 --> 00:18:37,288
- Yes, Renata. How is she?
- Good.

255
00:18:37,591 --> 00:18:40,992
Well, not... She's been better. I mean...

256
00:18:41,095 --> 00:18:42,357
She died.

257
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:45,658
I'm sorry.

258
00:18:45,766 --> 00:18:49,361
Oh, don't be. She believed in heaven,
so she's covered.

259
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,994
You know, afterlife-wise?

260
00:19:00,814 --> 00:19:03,908
- What's this?
- She left it for you.

261
00:19:04,151 --> 00:19:07,484
I think she hoped it would help me,

262
00:19:07,588 --> 00:19:09,988
you know, get a job here.

263
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:12,752
But of course.
Gusteau wouldn't hesitate.

264
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,918
Any son of Renata's is more than...

265
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:17,656
Yes, well, we could file this
and if something suitable opens up...

266
00:19:17,764 --> 00:19:18,822
We have already hired him.

267
00:19:18,932 --> 00:19:22,663
What? How dare you hire someone
without my...

268
00:19:22,769 --> 00:19:24,498
We needed a garbage boy.

269
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:27,605
Oh, garbage. Well...

270
00:19:27,808 --> 00:19:29,503
I'm glad it worked out.

271
00:19:39,286 --> 00:19:40,685
I can't believe it.

272
00:19:40,954 --> 00:19:44,117
A real gourmet kitchen,
and I get to watch.

273
00:19:44,358 --> 00:19:47,452
You've read my book.
Let us see how much you know, huh?

274
00:19:47,661 --> 00:19:49,219
Which one is the chef?

275
00:19:51,665 --> 00:19:53,997
- Oh, that guy.
- Very good.

276
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,724
Who is next in command?

277
00:19:55,836 --> 00:19:58,634
The sous chef. There.

278
00:19:58,972 --> 00:20:02,874
The sous is responsible for the kitchen
when the chef's not around.

279
00:20:03,143 --> 00:20:06,476
Saucier, in charge of sauces.
Very important.

280
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:10,776
Chef de partie, demi chef de partie,
both important.

281
00:20:10,884 --> 00:20:13,682
Commis, commis, they're cooks.
Very important.

282
00:20:13,887 --> 00:20:16,981
You are a clever rat. Now, who is that?

283
00:20:17,691 --> 00:20:19,818
Oh, him? He's nobody.

284
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,986
Not nobody. He is part of the kitchen.

285
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,960
No, he's a <i>plongeur</i> or something.

286
00:20:24,064 --> 00:20:26,555
He washes dishes or takes out
the garbage. He doesn't cook.

287
00:20:26,667 --> 00:20:29,898
- But he could.
- Uh, no.

288
00:20:30,003 --> 00:20:32,233
How do you know?
What do I always say?

289
00:20:32,339 --> 00:20:33,966
Anyone can cook.

290
00:20:34,074 --> 00:20:38,010
Well, yeah, anyone can.
That doesn't mean that anyone should.

291
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:41,672
Well,
that is not stopping him. See?

292
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:47,079
What is he doing?
No. No! No, this is terrible!

293
00:20:48,889 --> 00:20:52,518
He's ruining the soup.
And nobody's noticing?

294
00:20:52,726 --> 00:20:54,626
It's your restaurant. Do something.

295
00:20:54,728 --> 00:20:57,891
What can I do?
I am a figment of your imagination.

296
00:20:57,998 --> 00:20:59,462
But he's ruining the soup!
We got to tell someone that he's...

297
00:20:59,497 --> 00:21:00,927
But he's ruining the soup!
We got to tell someone that he's...

298
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:11,106
Table five coming up,
right now.

299
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:20,282
Coming down the line.
Set.

300
00:21:29,396 --> 00:21:31,455
Hot! Open oven!

301
00:21:49,116 --> 00:21:50,708
Coming around.

302
00:22:11,305 --> 00:22:14,741
<i>Oui,</i> chef.
One filet mignon, three lamb, two duck.

303
00:22:35,195 --> 00:22:37,789
Fire those soufflÃ©s
for table six, <i>ja.</i>

304
00:22:37,998 --> 00:22:39,932
Five minutes, chef.
- Oh, God.

305
00:22:45,305 --> 00:22:47,705
Tonight,
I'd like to present the foie gras.

306
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:49,275
It has a wonderful finish.

307
00:23:08,729 --> 00:23:11,163
Ready to go on table seven.
Come on! Let's go!

308
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:12,322
<i>Oui,</i> chef.

309
00:23:54,074 --> 00:23:55,974
Remy! What are you waiting for?

310
00:23:56,076 --> 00:23:57,907
Is this going to become a regular thing
with you?

311
00:23:58,011 --> 00:24:00,673
You know how to fix it.
This is your chance.

312
00:24:55,502 --> 00:24:59,962
The soup! Where is the soup?
Out of my way.

313
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,667
Move it, garbage boy!

314
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:05,936
You are cooking?

315
00:25:06,146 --> 00:25:09,582
How dare you cook in my kitchen?

316
00:25:09,683 --> 00:25:11,742
Where do you get the gall

317
00:25:11,852 --> 00:25:15,481
to even attempt something
so monumentally idiotic?

318
00:25:15,589 --> 00:25:17,580
I should have you drawn
and quartered!

319
00:25:17,691 --> 00:25:20,785
I'll do it. I think the law is on my side.

320
00:25:21,962 --> 00:25:23,429
Larousse, draw and quarter this man

321
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:28,695
after you put him in the duck press
to squeeze the fat out of his head.

322
00:25:28,802 --> 00:25:31,930
- What are you blathering about?
- The soup!

323
00:25:34,207 --> 00:25:35,504
Soup?

324
00:25:36,209 --> 00:25:37,870
Stop that soup!

325
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:41,775
No!

326
00:25:56,196 --> 00:25:57,288
Waiter.

327
00:25:58,899 --> 00:26:01,197
Linguini!

328
00:26:01,401 --> 00:26:02,891
You're fired!

329
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:06,038
F- l-R-E-D! Fired!

330
00:26:06,139 --> 00:26:08,437
She wants to see the chef.

331
00:26:08,542 --> 00:26:10,635
But he...

332
00:26:26,026 --> 00:26:29,894
- What did the customer say?
- It was not a customer. It was a critic.

333
00:26:29,996 --> 00:26:32,157
- Ego?
- Solene LeClaire.

334
00:26:32,265 --> 00:26:36,326
- LeClaire? What did she say?
- She likes the soup.

335
00:26:36,503 --> 00:26:38,130
- Wait.
- What do you mean, "Wait"?

336
00:26:38,238 --> 00:26:39,865
You're the reason I'm in this mess.

337
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,338
Someone is asking about your soup.

338
00:26:51,451 --> 00:26:54,045
What are you playing at?

339
00:26:56,456 --> 00:26:57,718
Am I still fired?

340
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:59,951
You can't fire him.
- What?

341
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:03,359
LeClaire likes it, yeah?
She made a point of telling you so.

342
00:27:03,463 --> 00:27:04,760
If she write a review to that effect

343
00:27:04,864 --> 00:27:06,832
and find out you fired
the cook responsible...

344
00:27:06,933 --> 00:27:10,096
- He's a garbage boy.
- Who made something she liked.

345
00:27:10,203 --> 00:27:12,467
How can we claim to represent
the name of Gusteau

346
00:27:12,572 --> 00:27:14,733
if we don't uphold
his most cherished belief?

347
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:17,708
And what belief is that,
<i>Mademoiselle</i> Tatou?

348
00:27:17,811 --> 00:27:18,800
Anyone can cook.

349
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:29,383
Perhaps I have been a bit harsh
on our new garbage boy.

350
00:27:29,789 --> 00:27:32,053
He has taken a bold risk

351
00:27:32,158 --> 00:27:36,561
and we should reward that,
as Chef Gusteau would have.

352
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:39,922
If he wishes
to swim in dangerous waters,

353
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,523
who are we to deny him?

354
00:27:42,769 --> 00:27:44,999
- You were escaping?
- Oh, yeah.

355
00:27:45,105 --> 00:27:49,269
Since you have expressed
such an interest in his cooking career,

356
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,741
you shall be responsible for it.

357
00:27:52,846 --> 00:27:54,279
Anyone else?

358
00:27:56,282 --> 00:27:58,147
Then back to work.

359
00:27:58,852 --> 00:28:02,379
You are either very lucky
or very unlucky.

360
00:28:02,622 --> 00:28:07,992
You will make the soup again,
and this time, I'll be paying attention.

361
00:28:08,261 --> 00:28:11,025
Very close attention.

362
00:28:11,331 --> 00:28:15,768
They think you might be a cook.
But you know what I think, Linguini?

363
00:28:16,002 --> 00:28:19,369
I think you are a sneaky,
overreaching little...

364
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,868
Rat!

365
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,800
- Rat!
Get the rat.

366
00:28:26,012 --> 00:28:28,071
Linguini. Get something to trap it.

367
00:28:28,181 --> 00:28:29,773
It's getting away.
Get it, get it, get it.

368
00:28:30,483 --> 00:28:32,348
- What should I do now?
- Kill it.

369
00:28:32,452 --> 00:28:34,977
- Now?
- No, not in the kitchen. Are you mad?

370
00:28:35,155 --> 00:28:36,679
Do you know what would happen to us

371
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:39,258
if anyone knew
we had a rat in our kitchen?

372
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:40,986
They'd close us down.

373
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,494
Our reputation is hanging by a thread
as it is.

374
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:47,726
Take it away from here. Far away.
Kill it. Dispose of it. Go!

375
00:29:24,404 --> 00:29:28,238
Don't look at me like that!
You aren't the only one who's trapped.

376
00:29:28,341 --> 00:29:30,468
They expect me to cook it again!

377
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:33,474
I mean, I'm not ambitious.
I wasn't trying to cook.

378
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,707
I was just trying to stay out of trouble.

379
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:38,841
You're the one who was getting fancy
with the spices!

380
00:29:38,952 --> 00:29:43,855
What did you throw in there? Oregano?
No? What? Rosemary?

381
00:29:44,124 --> 00:29:46,592
That's a spice, isn't it? Rosemary?

382
00:29:47,127 --> 00:29:49,595
You didn't throw rosemary in there?

383
00:29:49,929 --> 00:29:54,025
Then what was all the flipping
and all the throwing the...

384
00:29:58,071 --> 00:30:01,472
I need this job. I've lost so many.

385
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:05,937
I don't know how to cook, and now
I'm actually talking to a rat as if you...

386
00:30:07,147 --> 00:30:08,375
Did you nod?

387
00:30:08,481 --> 00:30:10,608
Have you been nodding?

388
00:30:12,085 --> 00:30:13,848
You understand me?

389
00:30:14,387 --> 00:30:16,048
So I'm not crazy!

390
00:30:17,257 --> 00:30:19,316
Wait a second, wait a second.

391
00:30:20,393 --> 00:30:23,089
I can't cook, can I?

392
00:30:25,098 --> 00:30:26,861
But you...

393
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:30,332
You can, right?

394
00:30:31,571 --> 00:30:34,039
Look, don't be so modest.
You're a rat, for Pete's sake.

395
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,540
Whatever you did, they liked it.

396
00:30:37,143 --> 00:30:39,703
Yeah. This could work.

397
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:41,775
Hey, they liked the soup!

398
00:30:45,285 --> 00:30:50,348
They liked the soup.
Do you think you could do it again?

399
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,394
Okay, I'm going to let you out now.

400
00:30:57,197 --> 00:31:00,360
But we're together on this. Right?

401
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:03,558
Okay.

402
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,774
So this is it.

403
00:32:16,242 --> 00:32:20,079
I mean, it's not much, but it's,
you know...

404
00:32:22,282 --> 00:32:23,647
Not much.

405
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:27,380
It could be worse.

406
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,887
There's heat and light
and a couch with a TV.

407
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:32,423
So, you know, what's mine is yours.

408
00:32:33,459 --> 00:32:34,858
<i>Are you...</i>

409
00:32:34,961 --> 00:32:37,259
<i>Is this a dream?</i>

410
00:32:37,363 --> 00:32:39,661
<i>The best kind of dream.</i>

411
00:32:40,033 --> 00:32:41,193
<i>One we can share.</i>

412
00:32:42,435 --> 00:32:44,027
<i>But why here?</i>

413
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:46,094
<i>Why now?</i>

414
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,769
<i>Why not here?</i>

415
00:32:49,042 --> 00:32:50,771
<i>Why not now?</i>

416
00:32:51,577 --> 00:32:55,604
<i>What better place to dream</i>
<i>than in Paris?</i>

417
00:33:08,728 --> 00:33:10,958
Morning, Little Chef. Rise and...

418
00:33:12,465 --> 00:33:13,659
Oh, no.

419
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:16,968
Idiot! I knew this would happen!

420
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:19,868
I let a rat into my place
and tell him what's mine is his!

421
00:33:19,973 --> 00:33:21,099
Eggs, gone!

422
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:24,608
Stupid! He's stolen food
and hit the road! What did I expect?

423
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:27,202
That's what I get for trusting a...

424
00:33:29,849 --> 00:33:31,646
Hi. Is that for me?

425
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:44,356
That's good. What did you put in this?

426
00:33:46,432 --> 00:33:47,922
Where'd you get that?

427
00:33:51,137 --> 00:33:55,836
Look, it's delicious. But don't steal.
I'll buy some spices, okay?

428
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:02,479
Oh, no. We're going to be late.
And on the first day!

429
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:03,844
Come on, Little Chef!

430
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,880
"Though I, like many other critic,

431
00:34:05,985 --> 00:34:09,318
"had written off Gusteau as irrelevant
since the great chef's death,

432
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:13,984
"the soup was a revelation.
A spicy yet subtle taste experience."

433
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:16,084
- Solene LeClaire?
- Yes!

434
00:34:16,529 --> 00:34:20,693
"Against all odds,
Gusteau's has recaptured our attention.

435
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,633
"Only time will tell if they deserve it."

436
00:34:26,472 --> 00:34:27,803
Well...

437
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:36,912
You know.

438
00:34:39,986 --> 00:34:44,116
Look, I know it's stupid and weird,
but neither of us can do this alone,

439
00:34:44,223 --> 00:34:47,681
so we got to do it together, right?
You with me?

440
00:34:48,995 --> 00:34:51,463
So let's do this thing!

441
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:55,729
I...

442
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:12,584
Welcome to hell.
Now, recreate the soup.

443
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:16,585
Take as much time as you need.
All week if you must.

444
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,452
Soup.

445
00:35:31,304 --> 00:35:32,271
You little...

446
00:35:33,439 --> 00:35:34,531
Ow!

447
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:45,445
You son of a...

448
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,122
You got...

449
00:36:10,676 --> 00:36:12,576
This is not going to work, Little Chef!

450
00:36:12,678 --> 00:36:15,238
I'm going to lose it
if we do this anymore.

451
00:36:15,348 --> 00:36:17,782
We've got to figure out something else.

452
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:20,114
Something that doesn't involve
any biting, or nipping,

453
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:22,915
or running up and down my body
with your little rat feet.

454
00:36:23,022 --> 00:36:25,718
The biting! No! Scampering! No!

455
00:36:25,825 --> 00:36:29,056
No scampering or scurrying.
Understand, Little Chef?

456
00:36:30,329 --> 00:36:31,455
Little Chef?

457
00:36:33,666 --> 00:36:35,327
Oh, you're hungry.

458
00:36:42,675 --> 00:36:45,075
Okay. So let's think this out.

459
00:36:45,511 --> 00:36:49,743
You know how to cook,
and I know how to appear

460
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:51,574
human.

461
00:36:51,684 --> 00:36:54,551
We need to work out a system
so that I do what you want

462
00:36:54,654 --> 00:36:57,680
in a way that doesn't look like
I'm being controlled by a tiny rat chef.

463
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:59,883
Would you listen to me? I'm insane!
I'm insane! I'm insane!

464
00:36:59,992 --> 00:37:02,984
In a refrigerator talking to a rat
about cooking in a gourmet restaurant.

465
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:04,960
- I will never pull this off!
- Linguini?

466
00:37:05,064 --> 00:37:06,031
We gotta communicate.

467
00:37:06,132 --> 00:37:10,364
I can't be constantly checking
for a yes or no head shake from a...

468
00:37:12,305 --> 00:37:14,136
The rat! I saw it!

469
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:17,400
- A rat?
- Yes, a rat. Right next to you.

470
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:21,242
What are you doing in here?

471
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:26,384
I'm just familiarizing myself with,
you know, the vegetables and such.

472
00:37:26,485 --> 00:37:27,816
Get out.

473
00:37:29,488 --> 00:37:32,855
One can get too familiar
with vegetables, you know!

474
00:37:33,659 --> 00:37:36,628
That was close. Are you okay up there?

475
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,499
How did you do that?

476
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:07,023
That's strangely involuntary!

477
00:38:09,061 --> 00:38:13,088
<i>One look and I knew</i>
<i>we had the same crazy idea.</i>

478
00:38:14,066 --> 00:38:15,590
Okay.

479
00:38:26,212 --> 00:38:29,010
Where are you taking me? Wait.

480
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:39,552
Wait. I'm sorry.

481
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,322
Okay.

482
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:56,341
Okay.

483
00:39:56,202 --> 00:39:57,499
<i>Ã votre santÃ©!</i>

484
00:40:03,342 --> 00:40:04,741
All right.

485
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:32,898
That should do it.

486
00:40:36,709 --> 00:40:41,737
Congratulations. You were able to
repeat your accidental success.

487
00:40:41,847 --> 00:40:46,511
But you'll need to know more than soup
if you are to survive in my kitchen, boy.

488
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:51,113
Colette will be responsible for
teaching you how we do things here.

489
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:54,590
Listen, I just want you to know

490
00:40:54,693 --> 00:40:57,526
how honored I am
to be studying under such...

491
00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:00,997
No! You listen. I just want you to know
exactly who you are dealing with.

492
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,499
How many women
do you see in this kitchen?

493
00:41:02,601 --> 00:41:03,966
Well, I...

494
00:41:04,069 --> 00:41:06,469
- Only me. Why do you think that is?
- Well, I...

495
00:41:06,572 --> 00:41:08,767
Because haute cuisine
is an antiquated hierarchy

496
00:41:08,874 --> 00:41:11,502
built upon rules
written by stupid old men.

497
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:15,068
Rules designed to make it impossible
for women to enter this world.

498
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:17,445
But still I'm here. How did this happen?

499
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:20,144
Because, well, because you...

500
00:41:20,252 --> 00:41:22,379
Because I am the toughest cook
in this kitchen.

501
00:41:22,488 --> 00:41:24,149
I've worked too hard
for too long to get here

502
00:41:24,256 --> 00:41:27,191
and I am not going to jeopardize it
for some garbage boy who got lucky.

503
00:41:27,293 --> 00:41:28,487
Got it?

504
00:41:33,999 --> 00:41:38,095
Easy to cook. Easy
to eat. Gusteau makes Chinese food

505
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:40,229
Chine-easy.

506
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:45,974
- Excellent work, FranÃ§ois, as usual.
- It's good, isn't it?

507
00:41:46,078 --> 00:41:50,310
I want you to work up something
for my latest frozen food concept.

508
00:41:50,416 --> 00:41:52,646
Gusteau's Corn Puppies.

509
00:41:52,751 --> 00:41:57,313
They're like corn dogs, only smaller.
Bite size.

510
00:41:57,423 --> 00:41:58,583
What are corn dogs?

511
00:41:58,691 --> 00:42:00,907
Cheap sausages dipped in batter
and deep fried. You know, American.

512
00:42:00,942 --> 00:42:03,124
Cheap sausages dipped in batter
and deep fried. You know, American.

513
00:42:03,429 --> 00:42:04,555
Whip something up.

514
00:42:04,663 --> 00:42:08,190
Maybe Gusteau in overalls
and Huckleberry Tom hat.

515
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:11,497
Or as a big ear of corn
in doggie make-up.

516
00:42:11,604 --> 00:42:15,506
Yes.
But, please, with dignity.

517
00:42:42,078 --> 00:42:43,306
Get my lawyer!

518
00:42:44,213 --> 00:42:46,306
Well, the will stipulates

519
00:42:46,415 --> 00:42:50,181
that if after a period of two years
from the date of death

520
00:42:50,286 --> 00:42:51,583
no heir appears,

521
00:42:51,687 --> 00:42:55,987
Gusteau's business interests
will pass to his sous chef. You.

522
00:42:56,092 --> 00:42:58,083
I know what the will stipulates.

523
00:42:58,194 --> 00:43:03,461
What I want to know is if this letter...
If this boy changes anything!

524
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:09,635
There's not much resemblance.

525
00:43:09,739 --> 00:43:13,266
There's no resemblance at all.
He is not Gusteau's son.

526
00:43:13,375 --> 00:43:16,538
Gusteau had no children,
and what of the timing of all this?

527
00:43:16,645 --> 00:43:19,910
The deadline in the will
expires in less than a month!

528
00:43:20,082 --> 00:43:22,175
Suddenly,
some boy arrives with a letter

529
00:43:22,284 --> 00:43:27,244
from his recently deceased mother
claiming Gusteau is his father?

530
00:43:27,356 --> 00:43:28,823
Highly suspect!

531
00:43:28,924 --> 00:43:30,789
- This is Gusteau's?
- Yes, yes, yes.

532
00:43:30,893 --> 00:43:32,485
- May I?
- Of course.

533
00:43:32,595 --> 00:43:34,062
But the boy does not know.

534
00:43:34,163 --> 00:43:38,497
She claims she never told him,
or Gusteau, and asks that I not tell.

535
00:43:38,601 --> 00:43:42,594
- Why you? What does she want?
- A job for the boy.

536
00:43:42,705 --> 00:43:45,606
- Only a job?
- Well, yes.

537
00:43:45,708 --> 00:43:48,233
Then what are you worried about?
If he works here,

538
00:43:48,344 --> 00:43:51,279
you'll be able to keep an eye on him
while I do a little digging.

539
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:53,211
Find out how much of this is real.

540
00:43:53,315 --> 00:43:55,875
I will need you
to collect some DNA samples

541
00:43:55,985 --> 00:43:57,714
from the boy. Hair, maybe.

542
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:02,086
Mark my words.
The whole thing is highly suspect.

543
00:44:02,892 --> 00:44:05,087
He knows something.

544
00:44:05,194 --> 00:44:09,324
Relax, he's a garbage boy.
I think you can handle him.

545
00:44:15,671 --> 00:44:16,797
What are you doing?

546
00:44:16,906 --> 00:44:18,874
I'm cutting vegetables.
I'm cutting vegetables?

547
00:44:18,974 --> 00:44:20,703
No! You waste energy and time!

548
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:23,802
You think cooking is a cute job,
like Mommy in the kitchen?

549
00:44:23,913 --> 00:44:25,073
Well, Mommy never had to face

550
00:44:25,181 --> 00:44:26,739
the dinner rush when the orders
come flooding in,

551
00:44:26,849 --> 00:44:28,282
and every dish is different
and none are simple,

552
00:44:28,384 --> 00:44:29,749
and all of the different cooking times,

553
00:44:29,852 --> 00:44:31,046
but must arrive on the customer's table

554
00:44:31,153 --> 00:44:33,246
at exactly the same time,
hot and perfect!

555
00:44:33,355 --> 00:44:36,017
Every second counts,
and you cannot be Mommy!

556
00:44:38,661 --> 00:44:41,789
What is this? Keep your station clear!

557
00:44:41,897 --> 00:44:43,592
When the meal rush comes,
what will happen?

558
00:44:43,699 --> 00:44:45,257
Messy stations slow things down.

559
00:44:45,367 --> 00:44:47,665
Food doesn't go, orders pile up.
Disaster.

560
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:49,465
I'll make this easy to remember.

561
00:44:49,572 --> 00:44:53,064
Keep your station clear,
or I will kill you!

562
00:44:55,144 --> 00:44:57,408
Your sleeves
look like you threw up on them.

563
00:44:57,513 --> 00:45:00,209
Keep your hands and arms in,
close to the body. Like this. See?

564
00:45:00,316 --> 00:45:01,442
Always return to this position.

565
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:05,145
Cooks move fast. Sharp utensils,
hot metal, keep your arms in.

566
00:45:05,254 --> 00:45:08,155
You will minimize cuts and burns
and keep your sleeves clean.

567
00:45:08,257 --> 00:45:10,851
Mark of a chef:
Messy apron, clean sleeves.

568
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,689
I know the Gusteau style cold.

569
00:45:12,795 --> 00:45:16,094
In every dish, Chef Gusteau
always has something unexpected.

570
00:45:16,198 --> 00:45:19,099
I will show you.
I memorize all his recipe.

571
00:45:19,201 --> 00:45:23,001
- Always do something unexpected.
- No. Follow the recipe.

572
00:45:23,105 --> 00:45:24,572
- But you just said that...
- No, no, no.

573
00:45:24,673 --> 00:45:27,972
It was his job to be unexpected.
It is our job to...

574
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:30,044
- Follow his recipes.
- Follow the recipe.

575
00:45:30,145 --> 00:45:32,477
How do you tell how good bread is
without tasting it?

576
00:45:32,581 --> 00:45:36,779
Not the smell, not the look,
but the sound of the crust.

577
00:45:36,886 --> 00:45:37,853
Listen.

578
00:45:39,288 --> 00:45:42,815
Symphony of crackle.
Only great bread sound this way.

579
00:45:43,192 --> 00:45:46,093
The only way to get the best produce
is to have first pick of the day

580
00:45:46,195 --> 00:45:48,129
and there are only two way
to get first pick.

581
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:52,030
Grow it yourself, or bribe a grower.

582
00:45:52,334 --> 00:45:54,894
<i>VoilÃ !</i> The best restaurant get first pick.

583
00:45:55,004 --> 00:45:58,997
People think haute cuisine is snooty.
So chef must also be snooty.

584
00:45:59,108 --> 00:46:02,976
But not so.
Lalo there ran away from home at 12.

585
00:46:03,078 --> 00:46:05,638
Got hired by circus people
as an acrobat.

586
00:46:05,748 --> 00:46:07,238
And then he get fired

587
00:46:07,349 --> 00:46:10,079
for messing around
with the ringmaster's daughter.

588
00:46:10,185 --> 00:46:11,948
Horst has done time.

589
00:46:12,054 --> 00:46:13,043
What for?

590
00:46:13,155 --> 00:46:16,522
No one know for sure. He changes
the story every time you ask him.

591
00:46:16,625 --> 00:46:18,559
I defrauded a major corporation.

592
00:46:18,661 --> 00:46:22,153
I robbed the second largest bank
in France using only a ballpoint pen.

593
00:46:22,264 --> 00:46:24,789
I created a hole in the ozone
over Avignon.

594
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:27,596
I killed a man with this thumb.

595
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:29,804
Don't ever play cards
with Pompidou.

596
00:46:29,905 --> 00:46:33,466
He's been banned from Las Vegas
and Monte Carlo.

597
00:46:33,876 --> 00:46:37,073
- Larousse ran gun for the Resistance.
- Which resistance?

598
00:46:37,179 --> 00:46:40,148
He won't say.
Apparently, they didn't win.

599
00:46:40,549 --> 00:46:41,743
So you see.

600
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:46,184
We are artist, pirate.
More than cooks are we.

601
00:46:46,288 --> 00:46:49,689
- We?
- <i>Oui.</i> You are one of us now, <i>oui?</i>

602
00:46:49,992 --> 00:46:54,520
<i>Oui.</i> Thank you, by the way,
for all the advice about cooking.

603
00:46:54,897 --> 00:46:57,365
- Thank you, too.
- For what?

604
00:46:57,599 --> 00:46:59,066
For taking it.

605
00:47:03,806 --> 00:47:05,000
The rat!

606
00:47:07,209 --> 00:47:10,235
- But he is a...
- I just dropped my keys.

607
00:47:13,916 --> 00:47:15,781
Have you decided this evening?

608
00:47:15,884 --> 00:47:19,945
- Your soup is excellent. But...
- But we order it every time.

609
00:47:20,055 --> 00:47:23,616
- What else do you have?
- Well, we have a very nice foie gras.

610
00:47:23,726 --> 00:47:24,784
I know about the foie gras.

611
00:47:24,893 --> 00:47:26,690
The old standby,
used to be famous for it.

612
00:47:26,795 --> 00:47:28,922
What does the chef have that's new?

613
00:47:30,866 --> 00:47:32,493
- Someone has asked what is new!
- New?

614
00:47:32,601 --> 00:47:33,590
Yes. What do I tell them?

615
00:47:33,702 --> 00:47:35,397
- Well, what did you tell them?
- I told them I would ask!

616
00:47:35,504 --> 00:47:36,801
What are you blathering about?

617
00:47:36,905 --> 00:47:38,998
- Customers are asking what is new.
- What should I tell them?

618
00:47:39,108 --> 00:47:41,576
- What did you tell them?
- I told them I would ask!

619
00:47:43,178 --> 00:47:44,509
This is simple.

620
00:47:44,613 --> 00:47:46,740
Just pull out an old Gusteau recipe,

621
00:47:46,849 --> 00:47:48,510
something we haven't made
in a while...

622
00:47:48,617 --> 00:47:52,383
They know about the old stuff.
They like Linguini's soup.

623
00:47:53,455 --> 00:47:58,085
They are asking for food from Linguini?

624
00:47:58,527 --> 00:48:00,995
A lot of customers like the soup.
That's all we are saying.

625
00:48:01,096 --> 00:48:02,654
Were we saying that?

626
00:48:03,499 --> 00:48:06,434
Very well. If it's Linguini they want

627
00:48:06,535 --> 00:48:11,097
tell them Chef Linguini has prepared
something special for them.

628
00:48:11,206 --> 00:48:14,300
Something definitely off menu.

629
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:16,302
Oh, and don't forget to stress

630
00:48:16,412 --> 00:48:18,880
- its Linguini-ness.
- <i>Oui,</i> chef.

631
00:48:18,981 --> 00:48:23,145
Now is your chance to try something
worthy of your talent, Linguini.

632
00:48:23,252 --> 00:48:28,554
A forgotten favorite of the chef's,
sweetbread Ã  la Gusteau.

633
00:48:28,657 --> 00:48:30,284
- Colette will help you.
- <i>Oui,</i> chef.

634
00:48:30,392 --> 00:48:33,259
Now, hurry up. Our diners are hungry.

635
00:48:33,729 --> 00:48:36,163
Are you sure?
That recipe was a disaster.

636
00:48:36,265 --> 00:48:37,994
Gusteau himself said so.

637
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:41,467
Just the sort of challenge
a budding chef needs.

638
00:48:41,804 --> 00:48:43,135
"Sweetbread Ã  la Gusteau.

639
00:48:43,238 --> 00:48:45,729
"Sweetbread cooked
in a seaweed salt crust

640
00:48:45,841 --> 00:48:48,776
"with cuttlefish tentacle,
dog rose purÃ©e,

641
00:48:48,877 --> 00:48:51,402
"geoduck egg, dried white fungus?

642
00:48:51,513 --> 00:48:54,277
"Anchovy licorice sauce."

643
00:48:54,616 --> 00:48:57,744
I don't know this recipe,
but it's Gusteau's, so...

644
00:48:57,853 --> 00:49:00,378
Lalo! We have
some veal stomach soaking, yes?

645
00:49:00,489 --> 00:49:02,480
Yes!
The veal stomach, I get that.

646
00:49:02,591 --> 00:49:03,785
Veal stomach?

647
00:49:12,434 --> 00:49:13,492
Okay.

648
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:23,910
I'll be right back. Where...

649
00:49:25,314 --> 00:49:27,214
Hey, I got to... Hey!

650
00:49:27,549 --> 00:49:31,576
Don't mind me.
I just need to borrow this real quick.

651
00:49:31,787 --> 00:49:33,880
Let's see, over here...

652
00:49:33,989 --> 00:49:35,251
I'll be back.

653
00:49:36,425 --> 00:49:37,483
Thank you.

654
00:49:38,393 --> 00:49:39,860
Excuse me. I'm going to...

655
00:49:39,962 --> 00:49:42,556
Apparently, I need this. I'll be right...

656
00:49:42,698 --> 00:49:44,359
I'm going to pick that up.

657
00:49:44,466 --> 00:49:46,661
I got some of that spice.

658
00:49:47,569 --> 00:49:48,763
Okay.

659
00:49:49,004 --> 00:49:50,130
What are you doing? You're supposed

660
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:51,536
to be preparing the Gusteau recipe.

661
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:52,971
This is the recipe.

662
00:49:53,075 --> 00:49:55,134
The recipe doesn't call
for white truffle oil!

663
00:49:55,244 --> 00:49:57,769
What else have you...
You are improvising?

664
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:00,314
This is no time to experiment.
The customer are waiting.

665
00:50:00,415 --> 00:50:02,645
You're right. I should listen to you!

666
00:50:03,585 --> 00:50:04,950
- Stop that!
- Stop what?

667
00:50:05,053 --> 00:50:07,613
Freaking me out!
Whatever you are doing, stop it.

668
00:50:07,723 --> 00:50:09,748
Where is the special order?
- Coming!

669
00:50:09,858 --> 00:50:12,122
- I thought we were together on this.
- We are together.

670
00:50:12,227 --> 00:50:14,889
- Then what are you doing?
- It's very hard to explain.

671
00:50:14,997 --> 00:50:17,295
- The special?
- Come get it!

672
00:50:19,401 --> 00:50:22,063
I forgot the anchovy licorice sauce.

673
00:50:27,376 --> 00:50:31,472
- Don't you dare.
- I'm not, I'm not. I'm...

674
00:50:34,583 --> 00:50:35,675
Sorry.

675
00:50:37,619 --> 00:50:40,179
Is Linguini's dish done yet?

676
00:50:40,289 --> 00:50:43,315
<i>Ja.</i> It's as bad as we remember.
Just went out.

677
00:50:43,425 --> 00:50:47,020
- Did you taste it?
- <i>Ja,</i> of course, before he changed it.

678
00:50:47,129 --> 00:50:49,927
Good. What? How could he change it?

679
00:50:50,032 --> 00:50:52,125
He changed it
as it was going out the door!

680
00:50:52,234 --> 00:50:53,223
Ow!

681
00:50:53,335 --> 00:50:54,302
They love it!

682
00:50:54,403 --> 00:50:57,133
Other diners are already
asking about it, about Linguini.

683
00:50:57,239 --> 00:50:59,002
I have seven more orders!

684
00:50:59,107 --> 00:51:01,735
That's wonderful.

685
00:51:06,448 --> 00:51:07,574
I'd like one of those.

686
00:51:10,118 --> 00:51:11,608
Special order!

687
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:16,457
What is that?

688
00:51:16,558 --> 00:51:19,857
Special order! Special order!
Special order!

689
00:51:28,203 --> 00:51:29,636
To Linguini.

690
00:51:29,738 --> 00:51:32,298
- Congratulations, Mr. Linguini.
- Cheers, <i>ja?</i>

691
00:51:32,808 --> 00:51:34,776
Drink now, there's plenty.

692
00:51:39,147 --> 00:51:41,513
Take a break, Little Chef. Get some air.

693
00:51:42,584 --> 00:51:44,575
We really did it tonight.

694
00:51:49,458 --> 00:51:50,789
Dah!

695
00:51:54,529 --> 00:51:56,121
Got your toque!

696
00:51:57,132 --> 00:51:58,497
Oh, seriously now.

697
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:03,330
I'd love to have a little talk with you,
Linguini, in my office.

698
00:52:03,438 --> 00:52:06,100
- Am I in trouble?
- Trouble? No.

699
00:52:06,208 --> 00:52:10,008
A little wine, a friendly chat.
Just us cooks.

700
00:52:11,613 --> 00:52:15,105
The <i>plongeur</i> won't be coming to you
for advice anymore, eh, Colette?

701
00:52:15,217 --> 00:52:17,947
He's gotten all he needs.

702
00:52:20,722 --> 00:52:23,589
Toasting your success, eh, Linguini?

703
00:52:25,093 --> 00:52:26,617
Good for you.

704
00:52:26,728 --> 00:52:30,721
I just took it to be polite.
I don't really drink, you know.

705
00:52:30,832 --> 00:52:34,928
Of course you don't.
I wouldn't either if I was drinking that.

706
00:52:35,037 --> 00:52:39,235
But you would have to be an idiot
of elephantine proportions

707
00:52:39,341 --> 00:52:43,368
not to appreciate
this '61 ChÃ¢teau Latour.

708
00:52:43,578 --> 00:52:47,639
And you, <i>Monsieur</i> Linguini,
are no idiot.

709
00:52:48,583 --> 00:52:51,450
Let us toast your non-idiocy.

710
00:53:15,277 --> 00:53:17,142
- Remy!
- Emile?

711
00:53:17,512 --> 00:53:19,377
I can't believe it! You're alive!

712
00:53:19,481 --> 00:53:21,039
- You made it!
- I thought I'd never see you guys again!

713
00:53:21,149 --> 00:53:23,083
We figured
you didn't survive the rapids.

714
00:53:23,185 --> 00:53:25,346
And what are you eating?

715
00:53:28,223 --> 00:53:29,986
I don't really know.

716
00:53:30,092 --> 00:53:33,289
I think it was
some sort of wrapper once.

717
00:53:33,395 --> 00:53:38,094
What? No.
You're in Paris now, baby. My town.

718
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:41,692
No brother of mine eats rejectamenta
in my town.

719
00:53:51,213 --> 00:53:54,580
Remy! You are stealing?
You told Linguini he could trust you.

720
00:53:54,683 --> 00:53:58,949
- And he can. It's for my brother.
- But the boy could lose his job.

721
00:53:59,054 --> 00:54:02,217
Which means I would, too.
It's under control, okay?

722
00:54:03,125 --> 00:54:07,084
- More wine?
- I shouldn't, but... Okay.

723
00:54:07,462 --> 00:54:10,795
So, where did you train, Linguini?

724
00:54:10,899 --> 00:54:13,197
Train? All right.

725
00:54:13,435 --> 00:54:17,929
Surely you don't expect me to believe
this is your first time cooking?

726
00:54:18,039 --> 00:54:19,370
- It's not.
- I knew it!

727
00:54:19,474 --> 00:54:23,205
It's my... Second, third, fourth...
Fifth time.

728
00:54:23,311 --> 00:54:24,903
Monday was my first time.

729
00:54:25,013 --> 00:54:27,777
But I've taken out the garbage
lots of times before that...

730
00:54:27,883 --> 00:54:30,147
Yes, yes. Have some more wine.

731
00:54:30,285 --> 00:54:33,482
Tell me, Linguini, about your interests.

732
00:54:33,588 --> 00:54:35,613
Do you like animals?

733
00:54:35,724 --> 00:54:38,454
What?
Animals? What kind?

734
00:54:39,294 --> 00:54:43,094
The usual, dogs, cats, horses,
guinea pigs,

735
00:54:43,198 --> 00:54:44,358
rats.

736
00:54:45,867 --> 00:54:46,959
I brought you something to...

737
00:54:48,136 --> 00:54:49,160
No, no, no, no!

738
00:54:49,271 --> 00:54:50,932
Spit that out right now!

739
00:54:51,873 --> 00:54:55,001
I have got to teach you about food.
Close your eyes.

740
00:54:55,510 --> 00:54:59,913
Now take a bite of... No! No! No!

741
00:55:00,048 --> 00:55:03,415
- Don't just hork it down!
- Too late.

742
00:55:03,652 --> 00:55:04,914
Here.

743
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:09,589
Chew it slowly.
Only think about the taste.

744
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:14,152
- See?
- Not really.

745
00:55:14,262 --> 00:55:17,493
Creamy, salty sweet,
an oaky nuttiness.

746
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:20,625
- You detect that?
- Oh, I'm detecting nuttiness.

747
00:55:20,735 --> 00:55:23,829
Close your eyes. Now taste this.

748
00:55:24,306 --> 00:55:29,369
Whole different thing, right?
Sweet, crisp, slight tang on the finish.

749
00:55:29,478 --> 00:55:33,073
- Okay.
- Now, try them together.

750
00:55:34,015 --> 00:55:35,175
Okay.

751
00:55:35,650 --> 00:55:39,108
I think I'm getting
a little something there.

752
00:55:39,321 --> 00:55:41,312
- It might be the nuttiness.
- See?

753
00:55:41,423 --> 00:55:43,152
- Could be the tang.
- That's it.

754
00:55:43,258 --> 00:55:45,089
Now, imagine every great taste
in the world

755
00:55:45,193 --> 00:55:47,161
being combined
into infinite combinations.

756
00:55:47,262 --> 00:55:50,322
Tastes that no one has tried yet!
Discoveries to be made!

757
00:55:50,432 --> 00:55:51,797
I think...

758
00:55:52,968 --> 00:55:55,493
- You lost me again.
- Yeah.

759
00:55:55,604 --> 00:55:57,071
But that was interesting.

760
00:55:57,172 --> 00:55:59,936
Most interesting garbage I ever...
Hey! What are we doing?

761
00:56:00,041 --> 00:56:01,406
Dad doesn't know you're alive yet!

762
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:03,808
We've got to go to the colony!
Everyone will be thrilled!

763
00:56:03,912 --> 00:56:05,470
- Yeah! But...
- What?

764
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:08,515
Thing is, I kind of have to...

765
00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:11,041
What do you "have to"
more than family?

766
00:56:11,152 --> 00:56:12,449
What's more important here?

767
00:56:12,554 --> 00:56:14,146
Well, I...

768
00:56:15,624 --> 00:56:17,615
It wouldn't hurt to visit.

769
00:56:17,893 --> 00:56:19,554
- Have you had a pet rat?
- No.

770
00:56:19,661 --> 00:56:21,526
- Did you work in a lab with rats?
- No.

771
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:23,120
Perhaps you lived in squalor
at some point?

772
00:56:23,231 --> 00:56:24,823
Nopety nopety no.

773
00:56:24,933 --> 00:56:27,595
You know something about rats!
You know you do!

774
00:56:27,702 --> 00:56:31,035
You know who know do whacka-doo.
Ratta-tatta.

775
00:56:31,139 --> 00:56:33,539
- Hey! Why do they call it that?
- What?

776
00:56:33,642 --> 00:56:37,738
Ratatouille. It's like a stew, right?
Why do they call it that?

777
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:39,410
If you're going to name a food,

778
00:56:39,514 --> 00:56:42,449
you should give it a name
that sounds delicious.

779
00:56:42,584 --> 00:56:47,817
Ratatouille doesn't sound delicious.
It sounds like "rat" and "patootie."

780
00:56:47,989 --> 00:56:52,153
Rat patootie.
Which does not sound delicious.

781
00:56:54,162 --> 00:56:59,534
Regrettably we are all out of wine.

782
00:57:02,404 --> 00:57:04,372
My son has returned!

783
00:57:28,263 --> 00:57:33,860
And finding someone to replace you
for poison checker has been a disaster.

784
00:57:33,969 --> 00:57:37,803
Nothing's been poisoned, thank God,
but it hasn't been easy.

785
00:57:38,006 --> 00:57:42,409
- You didn't make it easy.
- I know. I am sorry, Dad.

786
00:57:42,510 --> 00:57:46,037
Well, the important thing
is that you're home.

787
00:57:46,147 --> 00:57:49,207
Yeah, well, about that...

788
00:57:49,317 --> 00:57:51,114
You look thin. Why is that?

789
00:57:51,219 --> 00:57:54,711
A shortage of food,
or a surplus of snobbery?

790
00:57:57,392 --> 00:58:00,418
It's tough out there in the big world
all alone, isn't it?

791
00:58:00,528 --> 00:58:03,588
Sure, but it's not like I'm a kid anymore.

792
00:58:03,698 --> 00:58:06,360
- Hey. Hey, boy. What's up?
- I can take care of myself.

793
00:58:06,468 --> 00:58:10,302
I've found a nice spot not far away,
so I'll be able to visit often.

794
00:58:10,505 --> 00:58:13,941
Nothing like a cold splash of reality
to make you...

795
00:58:14,042 --> 00:58:16,840
- Visit?
- I will. I promise. Often.

796
00:58:16,945 --> 00:58:21,882
- You're not staying?
- No. It's not a big deal, Dad. I just...

797
00:58:21,983 --> 00:58:24,611
You didn't think
I was going to stay forever, did you?

798
00:58:24,719 --> 00:58:26,949
Eventually,
a bird's got to leave the nest.

799
00:58:27,055 --> 00:58:29,319
We're not birds. We're rats.

800
00:58:29,424 --> 00:58:32,359
We don't leave our nests.
We make them bigger.

801
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:35,452
- Well, maybe I'm a different kind of rat.
- Maybe you're not a rat at all.

802
00:58:35,563 --> 00:58:36,587
Maybe that's a good thing.

803
00:58:36,698 --> 00:58:39,132
Hey! The band's
really on tonight, huh?

804
00:58:39,234 --> 00:58:41,464
Rats. All we do is take, Dad.

805
00:58:41,569 --> 00:58:44,060
I'm tired of taking.
I want to make things.

806
00:58:44,172 --> 00:58:46,231
I want to add something to this world.

807
00:58:46,341 --> 00:58:49,435
- You're talking like a human.
- Who are not as bad as you say.

808
00:58:49,544 --> 00:58:52,206
- Oh, yeah? What makes you so sure?
- Oh, man.

809
00:58:52,313 --> 00:58:56,010
I've been able to
observe them

810
00:58:56,117 --> 00:58:59,052
at a close-ish sort of range.

811
00:58:59,154 --> 00:59:01,418
- Yeah? How close?
- Close enough.

812
00:59:01,523 --> 00:59:05,152
And they're, you know,
not so bad as you say they are.

813
00:59:06,528 --> 00:59:09,588
Come with me.
I got something I want you to see.

814
00:59:11,199 --> 00:59:13,633
You know, I'm going to stay here.

815
00:59:14,402 --> 00:59:17,894
Make sure the floors and countertops
are clean before you lock up.

816
00:59:18,006 --> 00:59:21,169
Wait. You want me to stay and clean?

817
00:59:21,276 --> 00:59:23,176
Is that a problem?

818
00:59:23,411 --> 00:59:26,972
- No.
- Good boy. See you tomorrow.

819
00:59:34,489 --> 00:59:35,683
We're here.

820
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:48,368
Take a good long look, Remy.

821
00:59:50,004 --> 00:59:51,164
Now, this is what happens

822
00:59:51,272 --> 00:59:54,799
when a rat gets
a little too comfortable around humans.

823
00:59:55,777 --> 00:59:59,235
The world we live in
belongs to the enemy.

824
01:00:00,482 --> 01:00:02,609
We must live carefully.

825
01:00:04,052 --> 01:00:06,782
We look out for our own kind, Remy.

826
01:00:07,288 --> 01:00:10,883
When all is said and done,
we're all we've got.

827
01:00:15,764 --> 01:00:18,164
- No.
- What?

828
01:00:18,967 --> 01:00:25,167
No. Dad, I don't believe it.
You're telling me that the future is...

829
01:00:25,373 --> 01:00:28,342
Can only be more of this?

830
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:33,742
This is the way things are.
You can't change nature.

831
01:00:33,948 --> 01:00:39,113
Change is nature, Dad.
The part that we can influence.

832
01:00:39,554 --> 01:00:42,751
And it starts when we decide.

833
01:00:43,358 --> 01:00:47,590
- Where you going?
- With luck, forward.

834
01:01:11,486 --> 01:01:12,851
Hey! Yeah.

835
01:02:10,945 --> 01:02:12,105
Stop it.

836
01:02:46,481 --> 01:02:47,709
Good morning.

837
01:02:49,918 --> 01:02:51,385
Good morning.

838
01:02:52,654 --> 01:02:56,954
So, the chef,
he invited you in for a drink?

839
01:02:57,058 --> 01:02:58,582
That's big.

840
01:02:58,693 --> 01:03:01,491
That's big. What did he say?

841
01:03:06,034 --> 01:03:07,001
What?

842
01:03:07,936 --> 01:03:09,597
What, you can't tell me?

843
01:03:11,673 --> 01:03:16,372
Forgive me for intruding on your deep,
personal relationship with the chef.

844
01:03:16,477 --> 01:03:17,842
Oh, I see how it is.

845
01:03:17,946 --> 01:03:20,574
You get me to teach you
a few kitchen tricks

846
01:03:20,682 --> 01:03:23,412
to dazzle the boss
and then you blow past me?

847
01:03:23,518 --> 01:03:24,985
Wake up. Wake up.

848
01:03:26,321 --> 01:03:29,085
I thought you were different.

849
01:03:30,491 --> 01:03:32,857
I thought you thought I was different.

850
01:03:33,328 --> 01:03:34,625
I thought...

851
01:03:38,333 --> 01:03:39,857
I didn't have to help you!

852
01:03:39,968 --> 01:03:43,301
If I looked out only for myself,
I would have let you drown!

853
01:03:43,404 --> 01:03:44,496
But...

854
01:03:45,406 --> 01:03:50,002
I wanted you to succeed. I liked you.

855
01:03:51,980 --> 01:03:53,277
My mistake.

856
01:03:54,015 --> 01:03:57,314
Colette. Wait, wait. Colette!

857
01:03:57,518 --> 01:04:00,453
It's over, Little Chef.
I can't do it anymore.

858
01:04:00,822 --> 01:04:04,519
Colette! Wait, wait!
Don't motorcycle away.

859
01:04:04,625 --> 01:04:07,958
Look, I'm no good with words.
I'm no good with food either.

860
01:04:08,062 --> 01:04:09,791
At least not without your help.

861
01:04:09,897 --> 01:04:13,298
I hate false modesty.
It's just another way to lie.

862
01:04:13,768 --> 01:04:17,568
- You have talent.
- No, but I don't! Really! It's not me.

863
01:04:18,039 --> 01:04:19,768
When I added that extra ingredient

864
01:04:19,874 --> 01:04:22,707
instead of following the recipe
like you said,

865
01:04:22,810 --> 01:04:25,005
That wasn't me either.

866
01:04:25,113 --> 01:04:28,014
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I wouldn't have done that.

867
01:04:28,116 --> 01:04:29,913
I would've followed the recipe.

868
01:04:30,018 --> 01:04:31,383
I would've followed your advice.

869
01:04:31,486 --> 01:04:33,317
I would've followed your advice
to the ends of the earth.

870
01:04:33,421 --> 01:04:37,585
- Because I love your advice.
- But...

871
01:04:37,692 --> 01:04:39,353
But I...

872
01:04:39,727 --> 01:04:41,024
Don't do it.

873
01:04:41,129 --> 01:04:44,428
I have a secret. It's sort of disturbing.

874
01:04:46,801 --> 01:04:49,702
- I have a...
- What? You...

875
01:04:49,804 --> 01:04:54,002
- I have a ra...
- You have a rash?

876
01:04:54,142 --> 01:04:59,409
No, no, no. I have this...
This tiny little...

877
01:04:59,614 --> 01:05:00,774
Little...

878
01:05:01,816 --> 01:05:03,977
A tiny chef
who tells me what to do.

879
01:05:04,085 --> 01:05:06,076
A tiny chef?

880
01:05:06,187 --> 01:05:08,712
Yes. Yes. He's...

881
01:05:10,558 --> 01:05:13,686
- He's up here.
- In your brain?

882
01:05:15,396 --> 01:05:19,162
Why is it so hard to talk to you?
Okay. Here we go.

883
01:05:20,301 --> 01:05:24,203
You inspire me. I'm going to risk it all.

884
01:05:24,405 --> 01:05:29,172
I'm going to risk looking like the
biggest idiot psycho you've ever seen.

885
01:05:29,277 --> 01:05:31,472
You want to know why
I'm such a fast learner?

886
01:05:31,579 --> 01:05:33,604
You want to know why
I'm such a great cook?

887
01:05:33,714 --> 01:05:36,444
Don't laugh! I'm going to show you!

888
01:05:39,987 --> 01:05:41,113
No! No!

889
01:06:26,367 --> 01:06:28,892
- What is it, Ambrister?
- Gusteau's.

890
01:06:29,003 --> 01:06:31,904
- Finally closing, is it?
- No.

891
01:06:32,006 --> 01:06:35,100
- More financial trouble?
- No, it's...

892
01:06:35,209 --> 01:06:37,734
Announced a new line
of microwave egg rolls?

893
01:06:37,845 --> 01:06:39,676
What? What? Spit it out.

894
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:43,216
It's come back. It's popular.

895
01:06:47,522 --> 01:06:51,151
- I haven't reviewed Gusteau's in years.
- No, sir.

896
01:06:51,259 --> 01:06:52,351
My last review condemned it

897
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:53,984
- to the tourist trade.
- Yes, sir.

898
01:06:54,095 --> 01:06:58,293
I said, "Gusteau has finally
found his rightful place in history

899
01:06:58,399 --> 01:07:02,165
"right alongside
another equally famous chef,

900
01:07:02,270 --> 01:07:04,033
<i>"Monsieur</i> Boyardee."

901
01:07:04,138 --> 01:07:05,127
TouchÃ©.

902
01:07:05,239 --> 01:07:08,606
That is where I left it.
That was my last word.

903
01:07:08,776 --> 01:07:11,745
- The last word.
- Yes.

904
01:07:11,846 --> 01:07:14,144
Then tell me, Ambrister,

905
01:07:15,082 --> 01:07:19,018
how could it be popular?

906
01:07:19,954 --> 01:07:24,516
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

907
01:07:24,625 --> 01:07:27,753
The DNA matches, the timing works,
everything checks out.

908
01:07:27,862 --> 01:07:29,090
He is Gusteau's son.

909
01:07:29,197 --> 01:07:33,099
This can't just happen!
The whole thing is a setup!

910
01:07:33,201 --> 01:07:34,532
The boy knows!

911
01:07:34,635 --> 01:07:37,627
Look at him out there,
pretending to be an idiot.

912
01:07:37,738 --> 01:07:42,141
He's toying with my mind
like a cat with a ball of... Something.

913
01:07:42,243 --> 01:07:44,677
- String?
- Yes! Playing dumb.

914
01:07:44,779 --> 01:07:46,838
- Taunting me with that rat.
- Rat?

915
01:07:46,948 --> 01:07:48,643
Yes. He's consorting with it.

916
01:07:48,749 --> 01:07:51,274
Deliberately trying to make me think
it's important.

917
01:07:51,385 --> 01:07:53,876
- The rat.
- Exactly!

918
01:07:55,189 --> 01:07:57,783
Is the rat important?

919
01:07:58,025 --> 01:08:01,256
Of course not!
He just wants me to think that it is.

920
01:08:01,362 --> 01:08:03,626
Oh, I see the theatricality of it.

921
01:08:03,731 --> 01:08:06,393
A rat appears on the boy's first night,
I order him to kill it.

922
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:09,025
And now he wants me
to see it everywhere.

923
01:08:11,072 --> 01:08:13,131
It's here! No, it isn't, it's here!

924
01:08:13,241 --> 01:08:16,472
Am I seeing things, am I crazy?
Is there a phantom rat or is there not?

925
01:08:16,577 --> 01:08:17,669
But, oh, no!

926
01:08:17,778 --> 01:08:21,976
I refuse to be sucked into
his little game of...

927
01:08:25,186 --> 01:08:30,681
Should I be concerned about this?
About you?

928
01:08:50,611 --> 01:08:52,511
I can't fire him. He's getting attention.

929
01:08:52,613 --> 01:08:54,979
If I fire him now,
everyone will wonder why.

930
01:08:55,082 --> 01:08:57,550
And the last thing I want
is people looking into this.

931
01:08:57,652 --> 01:08:59,279
What are you so worried about?

932
01:08:59,387 --> 01:09:00,615
Isn't it good to have the press?

933
01:09:00,721 --> 01:09:03,349
Isn't it good to have Gusteau's name
getting headlines?

934
01:09:03,457 --> 01:09:05,857
Not if they're over his face!

935
01:09:06,394 --> 01:09:10,057
Gusteau's already has a face,
and it's fat and lovable and familiar.

936
01:09:10,164 --> 01:09:15,124
And it sells burritos!
Millions and millions of burritos!

937
01:09:15,236 --> 01:09:17,204
The deadline passes in three days.

938
01:09:17,305 --> 01:09:20,240
Then you can fire him
whenever he ceases to be valuable

939
01:09:20,341 --> 01:09:22,468
and no one will ever know.

940
01:09:23,010 --> 01:09:25,444
I was worried
about the hair sample you gave me.

941
01:09:25,546 --> 01:09:27,980
- I had to send them back to the lab.
- Why?

942
01:09:28,082 --> 01:09:32,610
Because the first time it came back
identified as rodent hair.

943
01:09:38,326 --> 01:09:39,554
- No, no, no.
- What?

944
01:09:39,660 --> 01:09:41,958
Try this. It's better.

945
01:09:56,043 --> 01:09:58,170
Well, because you...

946
01:10:22,436 --> 01:10:23,403
Rat!

947
01:10:29,944 --> 01:10:32,174
Disgusting little creatures.

948
01:10:42,056 --> 01:10:44,991
<i>I was reminded</i>
<i>how fragile it all was.</i>

949
01:10:45,893 --> 01:10:48,020
<i>How the world really saw me.</i>

950
01:10:49,563 --> 01:10:52,794
<i>And it just kept getting better.</i>

951
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:53,499
Remy!

952
01:10:53,534 --> 01:10:54,466
Remy!

953
01:10:54,568 --> 01:10:55,830
Psst! Psst!

954
01:10:58,005 --> 01:11:00,405
Hey, hey, hey, little brother!

955
01:11:00,608 --> 01:11:04,135
We were afraid you weren't going to,
you know, show up.

956
01:11:04,345 --> 01:11:08,145
- Hey, Remy! How you doing?
- You told them?

957
01:11:08,249 --> 01:11:11,116
Emile,
that's exactly what I said not to do!

958
01:11:11,218 --> 01:11:12,981
But you know these guys.
They're my friends.

959
01:11:13,087 --> 01:11:14,179
I didn't think you meant them.

960
01:11:14,288 --> 01:11:16,381
Look, I'm sorry.

961
01:11:16,490 --> 01:11:18,958
Don't tell me you're sorry,
tell them you're sorry.

962
01:11:19,059 --> 01:11:23,621
- Is there a problem over here?
- No, there is not.

963
01:11:23,731 --> 01:11:25,028
Wait here.

964
01:11:30,905 --> 01:11:32,167
It's locked?

965
01:11:39,213 --> 01:11:41,010
Remy, what are you doing in here?

966
01:11:41,115 --> 01:11:43,913
Okay. Emile shows up with...

967
01:11:44,018 --> 01:11:47,954
Okay, I said not to. I told him...
He goes and blabs to...

968
01:11:48,155 --> 01:11:50,214
Yeah, it's a disaster.

969
01:11:50,324 --> 01:11:53,953
Anyway, they're hungry, the food safe
is locked and I need the key.

970
01:11:54,061 --> 01:11:56,160
- They want you to steal food?
- Yes. No! It's...

971
01:11:56,195 --> 01:11:58,260
- They want you to steal food?
- Yes. No! It's...

972
01:11:58,365 --> 01:12:02,165
It's complicated. It's family.
They don't have your ideals.

973
01:12:02,269 --> 01:12:04,897
Ideals?
If Chef Fancy Pants had any ideals,

974
01:12:05,005 --> 01:12:07,064
you think I'd be hawking barbecue
over here?

975
01:12:07,174 --> 01:12:08,232
Or microwave burritos?

976
01:12:08,342 --> 01:12:10,401
Or, Tooth, I say,
Tooth Pick'n Chicken?

977
01:12:10,511 --> 01:12:12,274
About as French as a corn dog!

978
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:13,504
Coming soon!

979
01:12:13,614 --> 01:12:15,514
We're inventing new ways
to sell out over here.

980
01:12:15,616 --> 01:12:17,208
Will ye be wanting some haggis bites?

981
01:12:17,318 --> 01:12:18,979
I cannot control
how they use my image, Remy.

982
01:12:19,086 --> 01:12:21,486
- I am dead!
- Can you guys shut up?

983
01:12:22,556 --> 01:12:26,617
I've got to think! Word's getting out.
If I can't keep them quiet,

984
01:12:26,727 --> 01:12:29,992
the entire clan's gonna be after me
with their mouths open and...

985
01:12:30,097 --> 01:12:31,121
Here it is.

986
01:12:31,565 --> 01:12:33,863
Hey. Your will!

987
01:12:33,968 --> 01:12:38,598
- Oh, this is interesting. Mind if I...
- Not at all.

988
01:12:41,275 --> 01:12:42,640
Linguini?

989
01:12:43,477 --> 01:12:46,207
Why would Linguini be filed
with your will?

990
01:12:46,313 --> 01:12:48,144
This used to be my office.

991
01:13:11,438 --> 01:13:12,905
He's your son?

992
01:13:13,007 --> 01:13:15,874
- I have a son?
- How could you not know this?

993
01:13:15,976 --> 01:13:19,969
I am a figment of your imagination.
You did not know, how could I?

994
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:21,931
Well, your son is the rightful owner
of this restaurant!

995
01:13:21,966 --> 01:13:23,782
Well, your son is the rightful owner
of this restaurant!

996
01:13:25,185 --> 01:13:26,854
No! No! The rat!

997
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:35,725
- Sorry, chef.
- The rat! It's stolen my documents!

998
01:13:35,829 --> 01:13:38,195
- It's getting away!
Hey, Mr. Chef!

999
01:15:12,526 --> 01:15:14,118
You!

1000
01:15:14,228 --> 01:15:18,892
- Get out of my office.
- He's not in your office. You are in his.

1001
01:15:22,136 --> 01:15:24,104
Bottoms up, Linguini!

1002
01:15:24,204 --> 01:15:26,604
<i>

1003
01:15:26,707 --> 01:15:27,969
Cheers, <i>ja.</i>

1004
01:16:35,209 --> 01:16:37,507
Chef! Chef!
Chef Linguini!

1005
01:16:38,712 --> 01:16:41,772
Your rise has been meteoric,
yet you have no formal training.

1006
01:16:41,882 --> 01:16:43,315
What is the secret to your genius?

1007
01:16:43,417 --> 01:16:47,012
Secret? You want the truth?

1008
01:16:47,688 --> 01:16:53,149
I am Gusteau's son.
It's in my blood I guess.

1009
01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:55,592
But you weren't
aware of that fact until very recently.

1010
01:16:55,696 --> 01:16:56,663
No.

1011
01:16:56,764 --> 01:16:59,528
And it resulted in
your taking ownership of this restaurant.

1012
01:16:59,633 --> 01:17:01,123
How did you find out?

1013
01:17:01,235 --> 01:17:04,500
Well, some part of me just knew.

1014
01:17:05,038 --> 01:17:06,369
The Gusteau part?

1015
01:17:07,775 --> 01:17:12,405
- Where do you get your inspiration?
- Inspiration has many names.

1016
01:17:12,613 --> 01:17:15,241
- Mine is named Colette.
- What?

1017
01:17:16,850 --> 01:17:18,909
Something's stuck in my teeth.

1018
01:17:22,422 --> 01:17:23,719
Health Inspector.

1019
01:17:23,824 --> 01:17:26,452
I wish to report a rat infestation.

1020
01:17:26,660 --> 01:17:27,752
It's taken over my...

1021
01:17:27,861 --> 01:17:30,227
Gusteau's restaurant.

1022
01:17:30,330 --> 01:17:31,388
<i>Gusteau's, eh?</i>

1023
01:17:31,532 --> 01:17:35,696
I can drop by. Let's see.
First opening is three months.

1024
01:17:35,803 --> 01:17:37,896
<i>It must happen now!</i>
<i>It's a gourmet restaurant!</i>

1025
01:17:38,005 --> 01:17:40,872
<i>Monsieur,</i> I have the information.
If someone cancels, I'll slot you in.

1026
01:17:40,974 --> 01:17:43,067
But the rat!
You must...

1027
01:17:44,745 --> 01:17:46,645
It stole my documents.

1028
01:17:47,848 --> 01:17:49,406
It's past opening time.

1029
01:17:49,516 --> 01:17:51,950
He should have
finished an hour ago.

1030
01:17:53,854 --> 01:17:56,084
<i>Bonjour, ma chÃ©rie.</i>
Join us.

1031
01:17:56,190 --> 01:17:58,317
We were just talking
about my inspiration.

1032
01:17:58,525 --> 01:18:00,823
Yes, he calls it his tiny chef.

1033
01:18:02,095 --> 01:18:04,495
Not that, dearest. I meant you.

1034
01:18:07,134 --> 01:18:08,863
- It's him.
- Ego?

1035
01:18:08,969 --> 01:18:09,936
Anton Ego!

1036
01:18:10,137 --> 01:18:11,399
Is that Ego?

1037
01:18:12,172 --> 01:18:13,605
I can't believe it.

1038
01:18:13,774 --> 01:18:17,039
- You are <i>Monsieur</i> Linguini?
- Hello.

1039
01:18:17,144 --> 01:18:21,638
Pardon me for interrupting
your premature celebration,

1040
01:18:21,748 --> 01:18:25,445
but I thought it only fair
to give you a sporting chance

1041
01:18:25,552 --> 01:18:27,713
as you are new to this game.

1042
01:18:28,989 --> 01:18:30,251
- Game?
- Yes.

1043
01:18:30,357 --> 01:18:33,417
And you've been playing
without an opponent.

1044
01:18:33,527 --> 01:18:38,658
Which is, as you may have guessed,
against the rules.

1045
01:18:38,866 --> 01:18:40,925
You're Anton Ego.

1046
01:18:42,502 --> 01:18:45,403
You're slow
for someone in the fast lane.

1047
01:18:47,007 --> 01:18:49,976
And you're thin
for someone who likes food.

1048
01:18:53,580 --> 01:18:57,607
I don't like food. I love it.

1049
01:18:58,051 --> 01:19:02,283
If I don't love it, I don't swallow.

1050
01:19:03,657 --> 01:19:07,616
I will return tomorrow night
with high expectations.

1051
01:19:08,061 --> 01:19:10,859
Pray you don't disappoint me.

1052
01:19:18,171 --> 01:19:21,607
Listen, we hate to be rude,
but we're French, and it's dinnertime.

1053
01:19:21,708 --> 01:19:24,836
She meant to say,
"It's dinnertime and we're French."

1054
01:19:26,713 --> 01:19:28,271
Don't give me that look.

1055
01:19:28,382 --> 01:19:30,543
You were distracting me
in front of the press.

1056
01:19:30,651 --> 01:19:35,088
How am I supposed to concentrate with
you yanking on my hair all the time?

1057
01:19:35,188 --> 01:19:36,450
And that's another thing.

1058
01:19:36,556 --> 01:19:39,457
Your opinion isn't the only one
that matters here.

1059
01:19:39,559 --> 01:19:42,153
Colette knows how to cook, too,
you know.

1060
01:19:42,262 --> 01:19:43,752
All right, that's it!

1061
01:19:47,868 --> 01:19:49,597
You take a break, Little Chef.

1062
01:19:49,703 --> 01:19:50,931
I'm not your puppet,

1063
01:19:51,038 --> 01:19:54,132
and you're not
my puppet-controlling guy!

1064
01:19:54,241 --> 01:19:56,038
The rat is the cook.

1065
01:19:56,143 --> 01:19:57,592
You cool off and get your mind right,
Little Chef.

1066
01:19:57,627 --> 01:19:59,041
You cool off and get your mind right,
Little Chef.

1067
01:19:59,146 --> 01:20:02,115
Ego is coming, and I need to focus!

1068
01:20:05,218 --> 01:20:06,583
You stupid...

1069
01:20:09,122 --> 01:20:12,353
Wow. I have never seen that before.

1070
01:20:12,459 --> 01:20:15,758
Yeah, it's like you're his fluffy bunny
or something.

1071
01:20:17,264 --> 01:20:18,754
I'm sorry, Remy.

1072
01:20:18,865 --> 01:20:19,854
I know there are too many guys.

1073
01:20:19,967 --> 01:20:20,934
- I tried to limit...
- You know what?

1074
01:20:21,034 --> 01:20:22,865
It's okay. I've been selfish.

1075
01:20:22,970 --> 01:20:24,995
- You guys hungry?
- Are you kidding?

1076
01:20:25,105 --> 01:20:28,074
All right. Dinner's on me.
We'll go after closing time.

1077
01:20:28,175 --> 01:20:29,335
- In fact...
- Yeah.

1078
01:20:29,443 --> 01:20:31,809
...tell Dad to bring the whole clan.

1079
01:20:33,447 --> 01:20:34,971
Little Chef?

1080
01:20:44,458 --> 01:20:49,191
This is great, Son.
An inside job. I see the appeal.

1081
01:21:08,849 --> 01:21:09,907
Oof!

1082
01:21:26,133 --> 01:21:27,532
Little Chef?

1083
01:21:28,301 --> 01:21:29,563
Little Chef?

1084
01:21:30,303 --> 01:21:31,895
Hey, Little Chef.

1085
01:21:32,239 --> 01:21:35,299
I thought you went back
to the apartment.

1086
01:21:35,509 --> 01:21:39,639
Then when you weren't there,
I don't know...

1087
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:44,007
It didn't seem right to leave things
the way that we did, so...

1088
01:21:45,052 --> 01:21:46,952
Look, I don't want to fight.

1089
01:21:47,154 --> 01:21:49,782
I've been under a lot of, you know,
pressure.

1090
01:21:49,990 --> 01:21:53,323
A lot has changed
in not very much time, you know?

1091
01:21:53,427 --> 01:21:54,689
I'm suddenly a Gusteau.

1092
01:21:54,795 --> 01:21:56,695
And I got to be a Gusteau or, you know,

1093
01:21:57,964 --> 01:21:59,522
people will be disappointed.

1094
01:21:59,933 --> 01:22:01,525
It's weird.

1095
01:22:01,635 --> 01:22:04,570
You know, I've never
disappointed anyone before,

1096
01:22:04,671 --> 01:22:07,469
because nobody's
ever expected anything of me.

1097
01:22:07,574 --> 01:22:10,338
And the only reason
anyone expects anything from me now

1098
01:22:10,444 --> 01:22:12,605
is because of you.

1099
01:22:14,247 --> 01:22:15,942
I haven't been fair to you.

1100
01:22:16,049 --> 01:22:19,507
You've never failed me,
and I should never forget that.

1101
01:22:19,719 --> 01:22:21,414
You've been a good friend.

1102
01:22:21,621 --> 01:22:24,647
The most honorable friend
a guy could ever ask...

1103
01:22:26,593 --> 01:22:27,890
What is this?

1104
01:22:28,361 --> 01:22:30,056
What's going on?

1105
01:22:32,499 --> 01:22:33,488
What...

1106
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,567
Hey...

1107
01:22:35,168 --> 01:22:36,465
You're...

1108
01:22:36,570 --> 01:22:39,630
You're stealing food? How could you?

1109
01:22:39,739 --> 01:22:42,867
I thought you were my friend!
I trusted you!

1110
01:22:43,076 --> 01:22:45,306
Get out! You and all your rat buddies!

1111
01:22:45,412 --> 01:22:46,811
And don't come back

1112
01:22:46,913 --> 01:22:50,371
or I'll treat you the way restaurants
are supposed to treat pests!

1113
01:22:58,492 --> 01:23:01,757
You're right, Dad. Who am I kidding?

1114
01:23:02,295 --> 01:23:05,696
We are what we are, and we're rats.

1115
01:23:07,167 --> 01:23:10,967
Well, he'll leave soon,
and now you know how to get in.

1116
01:23:11,438 --> 01:23:12,837
Steal all you want.

1117
01:23:12,939 --> 01:23:15,874
- You're not coming?
- I've lost my appetite.

1118
01:23:30,457 --> 01:23:32,925
Do you know
what you would like this evening, sir?

1119
01:23:33,026 --> 01:23:37,827
Yes,
I'd like your heart roasted on a spit.

1120
01:23:43,203 --> 01:23:44,761
Come in!

1121
01:23:44,971 --> 01:23:48,168
Today's the big day.
You should say something to them.

1122
01:23:48,275 --> 01:23:52,143
- Like what?
- You are the boss. Inspire them.

1123
01:23:55,482 --> 01:23:56,972
Attention.

1124
01:23:57,083 --> 01:23:59,853
Attention, everyone.

1125
01:24:00,020 --> 01:24:02,250
Tonight is a big night.

1126
01:24:02,455 --> 01:24:06,323
Appetite is coming,
and he's going to have a big ego.

1127
01:24:06,526 --> 01:24:10,485
I mean, Ego. He's coming. The critic.

1128
01:24:11,198 --> 01:24:14,167
And he's going to order something.

1129
01:24:14,768 --> 01:24:16,793
Something from our menu.

1130
01:24:17,504 --> 01:24:21,600
And we'll have to cook it,
unless he orders something cold.

1131
01:24:21,708 --> 01:24:23,573
Just can't leave it alone,
can you?

1132
01:24:23,677 --> 01:24:27,306
You really shouldn't be here
during restaurant hours. It's not safe.

1133
01:24:27,414 --> 01:24:28,642
I'm hungry!

1134
01:24:28,748 --> 01:24:31,376
And I don't need the inside food
to be happy.

1135
01:24:31,484 --> 01:24:34,544
The key, my friend, is to not be picky.

1136
01:24:34,921 --> 01:24:36,980
- Observe.
- No, wait!

1137
01:24:38,625 --> 01:24:42,493
- Oh, no! No, no! What do we do?
- I'll go get Dad.

1138
01:24:45,065 --> 01:24:51,334
You might think you are a chef
but you are still only a rat.

1139
01:24:51,738 --> 01:24:54,969
Sure he took away a star
last time he reviewed this place.

1140
01:24:55,075 --> 01:24:57,475
Sure it probably killed... Dad.

1141
01:24:57,777 --> 01:25:01,543
- This is very bad juju right here.
- But I'll tell you one thing...

1142
01:25:01,648 --> 01:25:04,378
- Ego is here.
- Ego? He is here?

1143
01:25:06,386 --> 01:25:10,550
Anton Ego is just another customer.
Let's cook!

1144
01:25:10,657 --> 01:25:12,522
Yeah! Let's...

1145
01:25:12,959 --> 01:25:14,153
Okay.

1146
01:25:15,629 --> 01:25:18,496
So I have in mind
a simple arrangement.

1147
01:25:18,698 --> 01:25:22,759
You will create for me a new line
of Chef Skinner frozen foods.

1148
01:25:22,869 --> 01:25:26,635
And I, in return, will not kill you.

1149
01:25:30,410 --> 01:25:33,573
<i>Au revoir,</i> rat!

1150
01:25:40,787 --> 01:25:43,449
Do you know
what you would like this evening, sir?

1151
01:25:43,556 --> 01:25:45,080
Yes, I think I do.

1152
01:25:45,592 --> 01:25:49,722
After reading a lot of overheated
puffery about your new cook,

1153
01:25:49,829 --> 01:25:51,888
you know what I'm craving?

1154
01:25:52,966 --> 01:25:56,231
A little perspective.

1155
01:25:56,436 --> 01:26:01,499
That's it. I'd like some fresh, clear,
well seasoned perspective.

1156
01:26:01,608 --> 01:26:04,406
Can you suggest
a good wine to go with that?

1157
01:26:04,511 --> 01:26:09,414
- With what, sir?
- Perspective. Fresh out, I take it?

1158
01:26:09,516 --> 01:26:10,676
I am...

1159
01:26:11,818 --> 01:26:14,582
Very well.
Since you're all out of perspective

1160
01:26:14,688 --> 01:26:18,055
and no one else
seems to have it in this bloody town,

1161
01:26:18,158 --> 01:26:19,682
I'll make you a deal.

1162
01:26:19,793 --> 01:26:23,889
You provide the food,
I'll provide the perspective.

1163
01:26:23,997 --> 01:26:28,024
Which would go nicely
with a bottle of Cheval Blanc 1947.

1164
01:26:28,134 --> 01:26:29,931
I'm afraid I...

1165
01:26:31,638 --> 01:26:34,004
Your dinner selection?

1166
01:26:34,708 --> 01:26:39,475
Tell your Chef Linguini that I want
whatever he dares to serve me.

1167
01:26:39,579 --> 01:26:43,037
Tell him to hit me with his best shot.

1168
01:26:46,786 --> 01:26:49,687
I will have whatever he is having.

1169
01:26:56,529 --> 01:27:00,021
- So, we have given up.
- Why do you say that?

1170
01:27:00,233 --> 01:27:03,259
We are in a cage inside the car trunk

1171
01:27:03,470 --> 01:27:06,371
awaiting a future
in frozen food products.

1172
01:27:06,573 --> 01:27:10,339
No, I'm the one in a cage. I've given up.

1173
01:27:10,677 --> 01:27:13,043
You are free.

1174
01:27:13,246 --> 01:27:16,647
I am only as free
as you imagine me to be.

1175
01:27:16,750 --> 01:27:17,978
As you are.

1176
01:27:18,084 --> 01:27:22,714
Oh, please. I'm sick of pretending.
I pretend to be a rat for my father.

1177
01:27:22,822 --> 01:27:25,222
I pretend to be a human
through Linguini.

1178
01:27:25,325 --> 01:27:28,055
I pretend you exist
so I have someone to talk to!

1179
01:27:28,161 --> 01:27:30,129
You only tell me stuff I already know!

1180
01:27:30,230 --> 01:27:33,222
I know who I am!
Why do I need you to tell me?

1181
01:27:33,333 --> 01:27:35,301
Why do I need to pretend?

1182
01:27:37,404 --> 01:27:39,031
But you don't, Remy.

1183
01:27:39,839 --> 01:27:41,466
You never did.

1184
01:27:50,450 --> 01:27:52,418
No. My other left!

1185
01:27:52,619 --> 01:27:54,416
Dad? Dad, I'm in here!

1186
01:27:54,621 --> 01:27:56,919
I'm inside the trunk! What the...

1187
01:27:57,223 --> 01:27:58,212
Dad!

1188
01:27:58,858 --> 01:28:01,383
- Hey, little brother!
- Emile!

1189
01:28:04,931 --> 01:28:06,990
I love you guys!

1190
01:28:09,068 --> 01:28:10,126
Where are you going?

1191
01:28:10,236 --> 01:28:12,761
Back to the restaurant.
They'll fail without me.

1192
01:28:12,872 --> 01:28:16,433
- Why do you care?
- Because I'm a cook!

1193
01:28:24,150 --> 01:28:25,947
It's your recipe.

1194
01:28:26,052 --> 01:28:28,111
How can you not know
your own recipe?

1195
01:28:28,221 --> 01:28:31,156
I didn't write it down. It just came to me.

1196
01:28:31,257 --> 01:28:34,351
Then make it come to you again, <i>ja?</i>
Because we can't serve this!

1197
01:28:34,461 --> 01:28:35,428
Where's my order?

1198
01:28:35,528 --> 01:28:37,894
Can't we serve something else?
Something I didn't invent?

1199
01:28:37,997 --> 01:28:39,055
This is what they're ordering.

1200
01:28:39,165 --> 01:28:41,497
Make them order something else.
Tell them we're all out.

1201
01:28:41,601 --> 01:28:43,296
We cannot be all out. We just opened.

1202
01:28:43,403 --> 01:28:46,395
I have another idea.
What if we serve them what they order!

1203
01:28:46,506 --> 01:28:48,633
We will make it.
Just tell us what you did.

1204
01:28:48,741 --> 01:28:50,106
I don't know what I did.

1205
01:28:50,210 --> 01:28:51,939
We need to tell
the customers something.

1206
01:28:52,045 --> 01:28:53,945
Then tell them... Tell them...

1207
01:29:00,053 --> 01:29:02,385
- Don't do it.
- Remy. Remy.

1208
01:29:02,489 --> 01:29:04,514
Don't! Stop!
They'll see you. Stop.

1209
01:29:04,624 --> 01:29:08,628
We're not talking about me.
We're talking about what to do right...

1210
01:29:09,062 --> 01:29:10,029
Rats!

1211
01:29:11,798 --> 01:29:13,356
- Remy!
- Get my knife.

1212
01:29:13,833 --> 01:29:15,460
Don't touch him!

1213
01:29:17,770 --> 01:29:20,136
Thanks for coming back, Little Chef.

1214
01:29:21,441 --> 01:29:23,739
I know this sounds insane, but...

1215
01:29:23,843 --> 01:29:26,403
Well,
the truth sounds insane sometimes.

1216
01:29:26,513 --> 01:29:28,310
But that doesn't mean it's not

1217
01:29:28,414 --> 01:29:30,609
the truth.

1218
01:29:31,317 --> 01:29:35,549
And the truth is, I have no talent at all.

1219
01:29:36,322 --> 01:29:40,224
But this rat,
he's the one behind these recipes.

1220
01:29:40,326 --> 01:29:45,423
He's the cook. The real cook.
He's been hiding under my toque.

1221
01:29:45,765 --> 01:29:47,699
He's been controlling my actions.

1222
01:29:49,769 --> 01:29:53,330
He's the reason I can cook the food
that's exciting everyone.

1223
01:29:53,540 --> 01:29:56,634
The reason Ego is outside that door.

1224
01:29:56,876 --> 01:29:59,674
You've been giving me credit
for his gift.

1225
01:29:59,946 --> 01:30:01,538
I know it's a hard thing to believe.

1226
01:30:01,648 --> 01:30:04,617
But, hey, you believed I could cook,
right?

1227
01:30:06,352 --> 01:30:10,516
Look, this works.
It's crazy, but it works.

1228
01:30:10,990 --> 01:30:13,458
We can be
the greatest restaurant in Paris,

1229
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:18,998
and this rat, this brilliant Little Chef,
can lead us there.

1230
01:30:19,732 --> 01:30:22,132
What do you say? You with me?

1231
01:32:10,109 --> 01:32:11,076
Dad.

1232
01:32:15,181 --> 01:32:18,150
Dad, I don't know what to say.

1233
01:32:18,351 --> 01:32:22,378
I was wrong about your friend
and about you.

1234
01:32:22,789 --> 01:32:26,657
I don't want you to think
I'm choosing this over family.

1235
01:32:26,859 --> 01:32:29,623
I can't choose
between two halves of myself.

1236
01:32:29,729 --> 01:32:33,563
I'm not talking about cooking.
I'm talking about guts.

1237
01:32:34,267 --> 01:32:36,667
This really means that much to you?

1238
01:32:44,677 --> 01:32:47,646
We're not cooks, but we are family.

1239
01:32:47,847 --> 01:32:50,839
You tell us what to do,
and we'll get it done.

1240
01:32:58,825 --> 01:33:02,454
- Stop that health inspector!
- Delta Team, go, go, go, go!

1241
01:33:02,662 --> 01:33:04,789
The rest of you stay and help Remy.

1242
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:29,651
Team three will be handling fish.
Team four, roasted items.

1243
01:33:29,686 --> 01:33:31,383
Team three will be handling fish.
Team four, roasted items.

1244
01:33:31,591 --> 01:33:37,029
Team five, grill. Team six, sauces.
Get to your stations. Let's go, go, go!

1245
01:33:37,330 --> 01:33:39,821
Those handling food
will walk on two legs.

1246
01:33:49,542 --> 01:33:51,510
We need someone to wait tables.

1247
01:34:06,793 --> 01:34:09,819
I'm sorry for any delay,
but we're a little short tonight.

1248
01:34:09,929 --> 01:34:12,193
Please, take all of the time you need.

1249
01:34:15,368 --> 01:34:17,962
He came in late one more time
and all of a sudden he...

1250
01:34:22,275 --> 01:34:24,607
Make sure that steak
is nice and tenderized.

1251
01:34:24,710 --> 01:34:27,042
Work it. Yeah. Stick and move.
Stick and move.

1252
01:34:27,146 --> 01:34:30,673
Easy with that sole meuniÃ¨re.
Less salt. More butter.

1253
01:34:30,883 --> 01:34:32,783
Only use the mimolette cheese.

1254
01:34:32,919 --> 01:34:36,548
Whoa! Compose the salad
like you were painting a picture.

1255
01:34:36,756 --> 01:34:39,384
Not too much vinaigrette
on that salade composÃ©e.

1256
01:34:39,492 --> 01:34:42,586
Don't let that beurre blanc separate.
Keep whisking.

1257
01:34:42,762 --> 01:34:46,926
Gently poach the scallops.
Taste check. Spoons down.

1258
01:34:47,133 --> 01:34:49,465
Good. Too much salt. Good.

1259
01:34:49,669 --> 01:34:52,570
Don't boil the consommÃ©,
it'll toughen the pheasant. Emile!

1260
01:34:52,672 --> 01:34:53,764
Sorry.

1261
01:34:57,376 --> 01:34:59,537
Colette, wait! Colette.

1262
01:34:59,979 --> 01:35:04,006
- You came back. Colette...
- Don't say a word.

1263
01:35:04,116 --> 01:35:05,674
If I think about it,
I might change my mind.

1264
01:35:05,785 --> 01:35:08,253
Just tell me what the rat wants to cook.

1265
01:35:11,357 --> 01:35:13,848
Ratatouille? It's a peasant dish.

1266
01:35:13,993 --> 01:35:16,962
Are you sure
you want to serve this to Ego?

1267
01:35:35,448 --> 01:35:37,313
What? I am making ratatouille.

1268
01:35:38,484 --> 01:35:40,952
Well, how would you prepare it?

1269
01:36:12,985 --> 01:36:16,148
Ratatouille? They must be joking.

1270
01:37:07,039 --> 01:37:08,802
No, it can't be.

1271
01:37:09,408 --> 01:37:13,037
Who cooked the ratatouille?
I demand to know!

1272
01:37:20,052 --> 01:37:21,679
I can't remember the last time

1273
01:37:21,787 --> 01:37:25,086
I asked a waiter
to give my compliments to the chef.

1274
01:37:26,058 --> 01:37:28,856
And now I find myself
in the extraordinary position

1275
01:37:28,961 --> 01:37:31,054
of having my waiter be the chef.

1276
01:37:31,263 --> 01:37:34,198
Thanks, but I'm just your waiter tonight.

1277
01:37:35,267 --> 01:37:37,735
Then who do I thank for the meal?

1278
01:37:38,604 --> 01:37:40,299
Excuse me a minute.

1279
01:37:51,317 --> 01:37:52,306
You must be the chef...

1280
01:37:52,418 --> 01:37:54,545
If you wish to meet the chef,
you will have to wait

1281
01:37:54,653 --> 01:37:56,712
until all the other customer have gone.

1282
01:37:58,758 --> 01:37:59,918
So be it.

1283
01:38:21,614 --> 01:38:24,139
<i>At first, Ego thinks it's a joke.</i>

1284
01:38:24,350 --> 01:38:30,289
<i>But as Linguini explains,</i>
<i>Ego's smile disappears.</i>

1285
01:38:35,895 --> 01:38:39,956
<i>He doesn't react</i>
<i>beyond asking an occasional question.</i>

1286
01:38:40,499 --> 01:38:44,868
<i>And when the story is done,</i>
<i>Ego stands, thanks us for the meal...</i>

1287
01:38:44,970 --> 01:38:46,631
Thank you for the meal.

1288
01:38:46,739 --> 01:38:49,606
<i>... and leaves without another word.</i>

1289
01:38:51,877 --> 01:38:55,813
<i>The following day his review appears.</i>

1290
01:38:58,350 --> 01:39:02,446
<i>In many ways,</i>
<i>the work of a critic is easy.</i>

1291
01:39:02,655 --> 01:39:06,887
<i>We risk very little,</i>
<i>yet enjoy a position over those</i>

1292
01:39:06,992 --> 01:39:11,053
<i>who offer up their work</i>
<i>and their selves to our judgment.</i>

1293
01:39:11,297 --> 01:39:16,667
<i>We thrive on negative criticism,</i>
<i>which is fun to write and to read.</i>

1294
01:39:17,203 --> 01:39:23,733
<i>But the bitter truth we critics must face</i>
<i>is that in the grand scheme of things,</i>

1295
01:39:23,843 --> 01:39:27,836
<i>the average piece of junk</i>
<i>is probably more meaningful</i>

1296
01:39:27,947 --> 01:39:31,212
<i>than our criticism designating it so.</i>

1297
01:39:31,584 --> 01:39:35,714
<i>But there are times</i>
<i>when a critic truly risks something</i>

1298
01:39:35,821 --> 01:39:40,121
<i>and that is in the discovery</i>
<i>and defense of the new.</i>

1299
01:39:40,226 --> 01:39:44,822
<i>The world is often unkind</i>
<i>to new talent, new creations.</i>

1300
01:39:45,030 --> 01:39:47,498
<i>The new needs friends.</i>

1301
01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:51,327
<i>Last night,</i>
<i>I experienced something new,</i>

1302
01:39:51,537 --> 01:39:56,497
<i>an extraordinary meal</i>
<i>from a singularly unexpected source.</i>

1303
01:39:56,709 --> 01:39:59,337
<i>To say that both the meal</i>
<i>and its maker</i>

1304
01:39:59,445 --> 01:40:02,937
<i>have challenged my preconceptions</i>
<i>about fine cooking</i>

1305
01:40:03,048 --> 01:40:05,744
<i>is a gross understatement.</i>

1306
01:40:06,152 --> 01:40:09,349
<i>They have rocked me to my core.</i>

1307
01:40:10,089 --> 01:40:13,547
<i>In the past, I have made no secret</i>
<i>of my disdain</i>

1308
01:40:13,659 --> 01:40:18,619
<i>for Chef Gusteau's famous motto,</i>
<i>"Anyone can cook."</i>

1309
01:40:18,931 --> 01:40:25,131
<i>But I realize only now</i>
<i>do I truly understand what he meant.</i>

1310
01:40:25,437 --> 01:40:29,373
<i>Not everyone</i>
<i>can become a great artist,</i>

1311
01:40:29,475 --> 01:40:33,809
<i>but a great artist</i>
<i>can come from anywhere.</i>

1312
01:40:34,413 --> 01:40:37,678
<i>It is difficult to imagine</i>
<i>more humble origins</i>

1313
01:40:37,783 --> 01:40:41,651
<i>than those of the genius</i>
<i>now cooking at Gusteau's,</i>

1314
01:40:41,754 --> 01:40:44,587
<i>who is, in this critic's opinion,</i>

1315
01:40:44,690 --> 01:40:48,922
<i>nothing less</i>
<i>than the finest chef in France.</i>

1316
01:40:49,128 --> 01:40:51,791
<i>I will be returning to Gusteau's soon,</i>
<i>hungry for more.</i>

1317
01:40:51,826 --> 01:40:54,454
<i>I will be returning to Gusteau's soon,</i>
<i>hungry for more.</i>

1318
01:40:54,833 --> 01:40:56,357
<i>It was a great night.</i>

1319
01:40:56,468 --> 01:40:58,197
<i> The happiest of my life.</i>

1320
01:40:58,304 --> 01:41:02,832
<i>But the only thing predictable</i>
<i>about life is its unpredictability.</i>

1321
01:41:02,942 --> 01:41:06,105
<i>Well, we had to let Skinner</i>
<i>and the health inspector loose,</i>

1322
01:41:06,212 --> 01:41:08,612
<i>and of course they ratted us out.</i>

1323
01:41:08,981 --> 01:41:10,608
<i>The food didn't matter.</i>

1324
01:41:10,716 --> 01:41:13,082
<i>Once it got out</i>
<i>there were rats in the kitchen,</i>

1325
01:41:13,185 --> 01:41:15,244
<i>oh, man, the restaurant was closed</i>

1326
01:41:15,354 --> 01:41:18,084
and Ego lost his job and his credibility.

1327
01:41:18,190 --> 01:41:20,124
But don't feel too bad for him.

1328
01:41:20,226 --> 01:41:23,718
He's doing very well
as a small business investor.

1329
01:41:24,063 --> 01:41:26,623
- He seems very happy.
- How do you know?

1330
01:41:31,136 --> 01:41:33,195
<i>

1331
01:41:34,807 --> 01:41:36,934
Got to go. Dinner rush.

1332
01:41:44,516 --> 01:41:46,177
You know how he likes it.

1333
01:41:51,557 --> 01:41:53,149
Thanks, Little Chef.

1334
01:41:59,832 --> 01:42:02,665
Can I interest you
in a dessert this evening?

1335
01:42:02,768 --> 01:42:05,896
- Don't you always?
- Which one would you like?

1336
01:42:07,039 --> 01:42:08,870
Surprise me.

1337
01:42:14,280 --> 01:42:17,716
Can I interest you
in a dessert this evening?

1338
01:42:21,186 --> 01:42:24,849
Hey, believe me, that story
gets better when I tell it, okay?

1339
01:42:26,759 --> 01:42:29,853
Come on. Bring some food over here,
we're starving!
