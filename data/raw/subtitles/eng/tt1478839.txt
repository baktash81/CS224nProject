00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:32,094
ENZO:
<i>Gestures are all that I have.</i>

3
00:00:34,692 --> 00:00:36,624
<i>I have no words I can rely on,</i>

4
00:00:36,626 --> 00:00:39,593
<i>because my tongue was designed
long and flat</i>

5
00:00:40,026 --> 00:00:41,890
<i>and is therefore
an ineffective tool</i>

6
00:00:41,892 --> 00:00:45,194
<i>for making complicated
polysyllabic sounds.</i>

7
00:00:53,492 --> 00:00:55,593
<i>And that is why I'm here now...</i>

8
00:00:55,894 --> 00:00:58,261
<i>waiting for Denny
to come home...</i>

9
00:00:58,894 --> 00:01:01,762
<i>lying in a puddle
of my own making.</i>

10
00:01:02,428 --> 00:01:05,425
(keys jingling,
door unlocks)

11
00:01:05,427 --> 00:01:06,694
DENNY: Yo, Enz!

12
00:01:08,427 --> 00:01:09,558
(door closes)

13
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,228
(footsteps approaching)

14
00:01:11,962 --> 00:01:12,894
Enzo?

15
00:01:13,761 --> 00:01:15,828
ENZO: <i>I hear the worry
in his voice.</i>

16
00:01:18,296 --> 00:01:19,763
DENNY: What happened, pal?

17
00:01:22,896 --> 00:01:23,893
Oh, Enz.

18
00:01:23,895 --> 00:01:25,628
ENZO:
<i>I can smell the day on him.</i>

19
00:01:25,896 --> 00:01:29,427
<i>Motor oil and gasoline
and roast chicken.</i>

20
00:01:29,429 --> 00:01:31,063
DENNY: Can you get up, bud?

21
00:01:39,663 --> 00:01:40,930
I'm here, buddy.

22
00:01:41,164 --> 00:01:42,298
DENNY: I'm right here.

23
00:01:44,164 --> 00:01:45,131
Okay.

24
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,030
ENZO: <i>If only I could speak...</i>

25
00:01:48,631 --> 00:01:50,331
<i>I would tell him not to worry.</i>

26
00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:57,831
<i>I saw a documentary
about Mongolia on TV once.</i>

27
00:01:58,731 --> 00:02:00,862
<i>In Mongolia,
they believe that when a dog</i>

28
00:02:00,864 --> 00:02:03,329
<i>has finished living
his lifetimes as a dog,</i>

29
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:05,564
<i>his next incarnation
will be as a man.</i>

30
00:02:05,897 --> 00:02:07,365
I'm right here, bud.

31
00:02:08,698 --> 00:02:09,831
There he is.

32
00:02:10,132 --> 00:02:12,864
ENZO: <i>I realize this would mean
losing all my memories,</i>

33
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:14,333
<i>my experiences.</i>

34
00:02:14,631 --> 00:02:16,198
<i>But I have a plan.</i>

35
00:02:16,898 --> 00:02:19,764
<i>I will try to imprint
what I know on my soul,</i>

36
00:02:20,299 --> 00:02:23,229
<i>carry it so deeply
in the pockets of my existence</i>

37
00:02:23,231 --> 00:02:26,499
<i>that when I open my eyes
and look down at my new hands,</i>

38
00:02:26,765 --> 00:02:28,364
<i>I will already know.</i>

39
00:02:28,366 --> 00:02:29,866
DENNY: There's my Enzo.

40
00:02:30,367 --> 00:02:31,900
ENZO: <i>I will be ready.</i>

41
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,034
<i>I will remember.</i>

42
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,898
(puppies whimpering)

43
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,366
ENZO: <i>He picked me
out of a pile of pups,</i>

44
00:02:43,567 --> 00:02:46,534
<i>a tangled mass
of paws and tails.</i>

45
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:49,598
<i>He'd stopped at the farm
on his way home</i>

46
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,668
- <i>from the speedway at Yakima.</i>
- DENNY: Hey.

47
00:02:52,968 --> 00:02:56,034
ENZO: <i>Even back then, I knew
I was different than other dogs.</i>

48
00:02:56,934 --> 00:03:00,033
<i>My soul just felt more... human.</i>

49
00:03:00,035 --> 00:03:01,069
This one.

50
00:03:01,502 --> 00:03:03,000
(chuckles) Definitely this one.

51
00:03:03,002 --> 00:03:05,336
- The pick of the litter.
- ENZO: <i>She always said that.</i>

52
00:03:07,403 --> 00:03:08,700
MR. SPANGLE:
Well, just a minute now.

53
00:03:08,702 --> 00:03:10,536
We were thinking of
keeping that one.

54
00:03:10,835 --> 00:03:12,736
ENZO: <i>He always said that, too.</i>

55
00:03:13,336 --> 00:03:14,336
Hey.

56
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,937
How much?

57
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:26,634
ENZO: <i>And so,
I had my first glimpse</i>

58
00:03:26,636 --> 00:03:28,003
<i>at the rest of my life.</i>

59
00:03:28,604 --> 00:03:30,804
(music playing on radio)

60
00:03:38,938 --> 00:03:40,205
(squeals)

61
00:03:41,336 --> 00:03:42,404
(young Enzo barks)

62
00:03:44,738 --> 00:03:46,939
(music continues playing)

63
00:04:42,408 --> 00:04:44,173
(indistinct chatter)

64
00:04:44,175 --> 00:04:45,643
Tony! Denny's here.

65
00:04:46,608 --> 00:04:47,773
TONY: Hey-hey!

66
00:04:47,775 --> 00:04:49,376
DENNY: Ah, just wait for it.

67
00:04:50,941 --> 00:04:52,506
I didn't know
you were getting a puppy.

68
00:04:52,508 --> 00:04:53,606
DENNY: Neither did I.

69
00:04:53,608 --> 00:04:54,773
Saw a sign on the road and,

70
00:04:54,775 --> 00:04:56,439
I don't know,
something came over me.

71
00:04:56,441 --> 00:04:57,773
Isn't that right, Enzo?

72
00:04:57,775 --> 00:05:00,040
"Enzo?" You mean like Ferrari?
That's rad.

73
00:05:00,042 --> 00:05:02,173
You can't look after a dog.
You're never home.

74
00:05:02,175 --> 00:05:03,840
Oh, you're gonna ruin
the moment, aren't you?

75
00:05:03,842 --> 00:05:05,807
Our best friend,
he's gonna ruin the moment.

76
00:05:05,809 --> 00:05:07,341
DENNY: I'll take him
on the road with me.

77
00:05:07,343 --> 00:05:08,941
He can be my good luck charm.

78
00:05:08,943 --> 00:05:10,074
TONY: Hey, you coming
to our show tonight?

79
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,609
We're opening for
The Scoffs at The Dive.

80
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:14,277
Oh, no, he can't. He's got
a new puppy to look after.

81
00:05:14,776 --> 00:05:16,376
See, he's good luck already.

82
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,510
I got the call this morning,
they need an extra driver.

83
00:05:20,177 --> 00:05:23,244
Yeah, sure. Yeah, I'll, uh,
leave you a pass at the gate.

84
00:05:24,776 --> 00:05:26,844
Okay, two passes.

85
00:05:27,643 --> 00:05:29,145
Who is this guy again?

86
00:05:29,511 --> 00:05:30,478
That's right.

87
00:05:30,777 --> 00:05:32,508
- ENZO: <i>I liked my new home.</i>
- (sniffing)

88
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,042
<i>It only lacked for grass,</i>

89
00:05:34,044 --> 00:05:35,642
<i>but I figured I could make do.</i>

90
00:05:35,644 --> 00:05:36,775
- Enzo, no!
- (whines)

91
00:05:36,777 --> 00:05:38,177
Don, I got to call you back.

92
00:06:15,298 --> 00:06:17,331
And... go ahead.

93
00:06:18,564 --> 00:06:20,330
Okay, bud, fire away.

94
00:06:22,097 --> 00:06:23,895
ENZO: <i>Denny seemed
unusually interested</i>

95
00:06:23,897 --> 00:06:25,398
<i>in my bathroom habits.</i>

96
00:06:26,297 --> 00:06:28,032
Go on. Go ahead.

97
00:06:35,798 --> 00:06:37,362
(urinating)

98
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:38,699
DENNY: Oh... (sighs)

99
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:40,565
Of course, you did.

100
00:06:40,765 --> 00:06:41,966
(chuckles)

101
00:06:45,231 --> 00:06:46,432
Okay, pal...

102
00:06:47,431 --> 00:06:48,798
it's time to turn in.

103
00:06:48,999 --> 00:06:50,933
Big day tomorrow at the race.

104
00:06:51,631 --> 00:06:53,999
So just be a good boy.

105
00:06:55,732 --> 00:06:57,066
Get some sleep, okay?

106
00:07:12,667 --> 00:07:14,435
(whimpering)

107
00:07:19,101 --> 00:07:20,499
(Denny groans)

108
00:07:20,501 --> 00:07:22,134
- (young Enzo barking)
- (sighs)

109
00:07:23,967 --> 00:07:25,034
Okay.

110
00:07:25,634 --> 00:07:26,901
All right.

111
00:07:30,167 --> 00:07:31,436
Okay.

112
00:07:33,301 --> 00:07:34,301
(sniffles)

113
00:07:38,635 --> 00:07:40,366
(indistinct chatter on TV)

114
00:07:40,368 --> 00:07:41,734
(sighs) Okay.

115
00:07:41,736 --> 00:07:43,035
<i>Of course. Just rub that in...</i>

116
00:07:44,303 --> 00:07:45,969
- (loud bang)
- (car honks)

117
00:07:48,436 --> 00:07:50,901
ENZO: <i>I'd later learn
it was called a television.</i>

118
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:54,270
<i>And, in time, it would teach me
much about human behavior.</i>

119
00:07:54,836 --> 00:07:56,101
<i>But that night,</i>

120
00:07:56,103 --> 00:07:58,368
<i>it felt like a window
into a whole new world.</i>

121
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,070
Oh, you like that, huh?

122
00:08:01,104 --> 00:08:02,170
ENZO: <i>Like it?</i>

123
00:08:02,436 --> 00:08:03,703
<i>No, I loved it.</i>

124
00:08:03,903 --> 00:08:06,104
(car engines whirring on TV)

125
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:12,037
DENNY: Right foot on the gas.

126
00:08:12,937 --> 00:08:14,405
Ease into the turn.

127
00:08:17,003 --> 00:08:18,005
(barks)

128
00:08:18,338 --> 00:08:19,338
(chuckles)

129
00:08:20,238 --> 00:08:22,238
(indistinct chatter)

130
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:24,802
ENZO: <i>And even better was</i>

131
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,405
<i>when he took me
to the race itself.</i>

132
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:32,172
MAN: Denny!

133
00:08:33,905 --> 00:08:36,239
- Oh, look!
- Oh, it's a puppy.

134
00:08:36,706 --> 00:08:39,139
ENZO: <i>Denny's apartment
was home, but this...</i>

135
00:08:39,706 --> 00:08:41,906
<i>this was where I truly belonged.</i>

136
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,106
(indistinct shouting)

137
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,170
(indistinct announcement
over PA)

138
00:08:47,172 --> 00:08:49,641
ENZO: <i>It was more thrilling
than I could've imagined.</i>

139
00:08:49,972 --> 00:08:52,206
(car engines roaring)

140
00:08:57,773 --> 00:08:59,005
What do you think, Enzo?

141
00:08:59,007 --> 00:09:01,074
ENZO: <i>I
thought it was heaven on earth.</i>

142
00:09:01,939 --> 00:09:03,540
WRIGHT: What'd you say
his name is again?

143
00:09:03,542 --> 00:09:04,738
Denny Swift.

144
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,938
KITCH: Number 96 car.

145
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,772
KITCH: He teaches for me
from time to time

146
00:09:07,774 --> 00:09:09,105
when he needs cash,
but you trust me,

147
00:09:09,107 --> 00:09:10,438
this kid's a diamond
in the rough.

148
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,506
CREW CHIEF: Copy that.

149
00:09:11,508 --> 00:09:13,742
(indistinct chatter)

150
00:09:25,175 --> 00:09:27,041
ENZO:
<i>The heat coming off the track,</i>

151
00:09:27,043 --> 00:09:30,110
<i>the breathless speed
and precision of the pit crew...</i>

152
00:09:30,675 --> 00:09:32,309
<i>I was in awe of it all.</i>

153
00:09:33,275 --> 00:09:34,973
(whirring)

154
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,742
He did a year in Formula Three.

155
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:39,640
Got picked up
by Zip Simone's Audi program.

156
00:09:39,642 --> 00:09:40,908
Started making a name
for himself,

157
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,240
but then Zippy went bankrupt.

158
00:09:42,242 --> 00:09:43,274
Then he lost his ride.

159
00:09:43,276 --> 00:09:44,975
(engine revving)

160
00:09:44,977 --> 00:09:46,111
Clear!

161
00:09:48,311 --> 00:09:49,244
(all applauding)

162
00:09:50,843 --> 00:09:52,974
KITCH: You really serious
about starting your own team,

163
00:09:52,976 --> 00:09:54,508
there's your man right there.

164
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,842
He's been down almost
a full lap this whole stint.

165
00:09:56,844 --> 00:09:58,608
It's not about
who's got the heavier foot.

166
00:09:58,610 --> 00:09:59,809
It's about the feel.

167
00:09:59,811 --> 00:10:01,212
(thunder rumbling)

168
00:10:02,178 --> 00:10:03,742
Denny was the first
to make the call

169
00:10:03,744 --> 00:10:05,212
to switch to rain tires.

170
00:10:06,611 --> 00:10:08,245
(crowd clamoring)

171
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:12,079
Step over here.

172
00:10:19,479 --> 00:10:20,713
Hey. Watch this.

173
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:31,877
In all my years of racing,

174
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:34,378
I've never seen anyone
like Denny in the wet.

175
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,611
Reminds me what they
used to say about Senna:

176
00:10:36,613 --> 00:10:39,181
"When it rains,
it doesn't rain on him."

177
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,047
(tires screeching)

178
00:10:51,513 --> 00:10:54,147
(cheering, whooping)

179
00:10:55,047 --> 00:10:56,479
- ENZO: <i>And when he won...</i>
- <i>Enzo!</i>

180
00:10:56,481 --> 00:10:59,147
<i>...I felt like I'd witnessed
true greatness.</i>

181
00:10:59,447 --> 00:11:02,015
(all cheering)

182
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,448
DENNY: Yeah!

183
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:10,915
First race, huh?

184
00:11:11,114 --> 00:11:13,049
What'd you think, boy?
You like it?

185
00:11:13,348 --> 00:11:14,515
Did you like it?

186
00:11:14,781 --> 00:11:17,115
- Hey, kid, you got a minute?
- Hey.

187
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:18,914
I want you to meet Sean Wright.

188
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:20,513
Hey. Denny Swift.

189
00:11:20,515 --> 00:11:23,312
He sold his tech company
for some obscene amount of money

190
00:11:23,314 --> 00:11:25,714
and now he's determined
to waste it all racing GTs.

191
00:11:25,716 --> 00:11:27,314
Yeah,
I think I've read about you.

192
00:11:27,316 --> 00:11:28,550
That was some win today.

193
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,316
You think you could drive
that way for him?

194
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:33,349
Try me.

195
00:11:35,048 --> 00:11:37,381
ENZO:
<i>My first year went by in a blur.</i>

196
00:11:37,383 --> 00:11:38,550
Wait. Let me see.

197
00:11:39,516 --> 00:11:41,982
ENZO: <i>I realize nobody
has a perfect childhood,</i>

198
00:11:41,984 --> 00:11:45,085
<i>but I'd contend
that mine came fairly close.</i>

199
00:11:47,783 --> 00:11:49,718
<i>Denny began racing
for Wright full-time</i>

200
00:11:49,984 --> 00:11:52,314
<i>and took me with him
whenever he could,</i>

201
00:11:52,316 --> 00:11:54,984
<i>like a four-legged member
of the pit crew.</i>

202
00:11:55,384 --> 00:11:57,086
(indistinct chatter)

203
00:12:03,451 --> 00:12:04,651
DENNY: Hey, Enz, you good?

204
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,952
ENZO: <i>I was better than good.</i>

205
00:12:07,619 --> 00:12:09,749
CREWMAN: Go! Clear!

206
00:12:09,751 --> 00:12:11,351
- (engine revving)
- (tires squeal)

207
00:12:13,152 --> 00:12:15,149
ENZO:
<i>Call it fate, call it luck.</i>

208
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:18,352
<i>All I knew was
I was meant to be his dog.</i>

209
00:12:19,454 --> 00:12:20,821
(man cheering)

210
00:12:22,586 --> 00:12:23,818
ENZO: <i>Denny always said</i>

211
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,383
<i>the best drivers
focus only on the present.</i>

212
00:12:26,385 --> 00:12:27,785
<i>Never dwelling on the past,</i>

213
00:12:27,787 --> 00:12:29,220
<i>never committing to the future.</i>

214
00:12:29,987 --> 00:12:31,584
(man shouting indistinctly)

215
00:12:31,586 --> 00:12:33,186
- Go get it!
- Whoo!

216
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:36,053
ENZO: <i>Reflection must come
at a later time.</i>

217
00:12:36,254 --> 00:12:38,452
<i>Which is why drivers
compulsively record</i>

218
00:12:38,454 --> 00:12:40,985
<i>their every move
with their in-car cameras.</i>

219
00:12:40,987 --> 00:12:42,386
DENNY: I got to turn earlier.

220
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,620
Get a better run on that corner.

221
00:12:45,189 --> 00:12:47,986
ENZO: <i>I learned so much
from him about balance,</i>

222
00:12:47,988 --> 00:12:50,389
<i>anticipation, patience.</i>

223
00:12:51,054 --> 00:12:52,986
Car goes where your eyes go,
Enz.

224
00:12:52,988 --> 00:12:55,586
ENZO: <i>And I would fantasize
that one day I, too,</i>

225
00:12:55,588 --> 00:12:57,052
<i>might actually race.</i>

226
00:12:57,054 --> 00:12:59,720
REPORTER: <i>Congratulations
on a spectacular win today.</i>

227
00:12:59,722 --> 00:13:01,920
<i>Not an easy race,
by any stretch.</i>

228
00:13:01,922 --> 00:13:04,190
<i>Well, you know,
I'm a risk taker.</i>

229
00:13:04,855 --> 00:13:06,220
Man, that win was all you.

230
00:13:06,222 --> 00:13:08,022
This guy hasn't even
mentioned you once.

231
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:10,654
You're way too good
for this guy, Denny.

232
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:12,789
You got to start getting
your own sponsors.

233
00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:14,755
Yeah, maybe.

234
00:13:14,757 --> 00:13:16,556
<i>My drivers look to me
as their leader...</i>

235
00:13:16,856 --> 00:13:19,191
Turn this clown off.
Put on the Mariners.

236
00:13:23,189 --> 00:13:26,289
ENZO: <i>There's an old saying
I'd often hear Denny repeat:</i>

237
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:29,323
<i>"No race was ever won
in the first corner</i>

238
00:13:29,691 --> 00:13:31,557
<i>but many have been lost there."</i>

239
00:13:31,857 --> 00:13:33,125
Just you and me, Enz.

240
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:35,391
Always you and me.

241
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,522
...and then accelerating
through.

242
00:13:38,524 --> 00:13:41,290
ENZO: <i>Nothing was more
important to us than racing.</i>

243
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,522
<i>I knew it was
only a matter of time</i>

244
00:13:43,524 --> 00:13:46,957
<i>before Denny reached his goal
of racing Formula One in Europe.</i>

245
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,692
- DENNY: (whistles) Come on!
- (Enzo barking)

246
00:13:49,292 --> 00:13:52,256
ENZO: <i>And the whole world
would see him the way I did.</i>

247
00:13:52,258 --> 00:13:53,158
Good boy.

248
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,426
ENZO: <i>He'd be adored
by fans everywhere.</i>

249
00:13:57,592 --> 00:13:59,726
<i>His victories
the stuff of legend.</i>

250
00:14:01,059 --> 00:14:02,990
<i>His name inscribed alongside</i>

251
00:14:02,992 --> 00:14:05,226
<i>the very best
our sport has ever known.</i>

252
00:14:05,493 --> 00:14:06,860
(chuckles softly)

253
00:14:09,591 --> 00:14:11,859
(car engines whirring on TV)

254
00:14:18,794 --> 00:14:21,426
ENZO: <i>But for now,
he was my champion alone.</i>

255
00:14:23,194 --> 00:14:24,693
(indistinct chatter)

256
00:14:24,994 --> 00:14:26,828
<i>And then she showed up.</i>

257
00:14:27,294 --> 00:14:28,927
(indistinct)

258
00:14:29,193 --> 00:14:31,061
- EVE: That was great.
- DENNY: Yeah.

259
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,060
Hey.

260
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,593
DENNY: Enzo, this is Eve.

261
00:14:35,595 --> 00:14:37,126
EVE: Hi, Enzo.

262
00:14:37,128 --> 00:14:37,927
How you doing?

263
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,826
ENZO: <i>My first impression of Eve</i>

264
00:14:39,828 --> 00:14:41,860
<i>was as complicated
as the scents in the air.</i>

265
00:14:42,061 --> 00:14:44,027
I'm not really
much of a dog person.

266
00:14:44,227 --> 00:14:47,659
ENZO: <i>A mélange of produce,
shampoo and pheromones.</i>

267
00:14:47,661 --> 00:14:49,594
Yeah, well,
he's more person than dog.

268
00:14:49,596 --> 00:14:52,061
ENZO: <i>Denny was clearly taken
with her grooming.</i>

269
00:14:52,462 --> 00:14:55,293
<i>She probably bathed every day,
for all I knew.</i>

270
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:57,362
Does he always stare at people
like this? (laughs)

271
00:14:57,662 --> 00:14:59,095
If he likes them.

272
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,927
So, are you a chef or something?

273
00:15:01,929 --> 00:15:04,094
No, I teach English
as a second language,

274
00:15:04,096 --> 00:15:05,529
and one of my students is Thai,

275
00:15:05,797 --> 00:15:07,627
and she made this curry
that was incredible.

276
00:15:07,629 --> 00:15:08,827
But it looks like
you have to go.

277
00:15:08,829 --> 00:15:09,860
I don't know
what's gotten into him.

278
00:15:09,862 --> 00:15:11,060
It was nice to meet you.

279
00:15:11,062 --> 00:15:13,263
Come here, come on!
Hey, uh, Eve?

280
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:17,062
My, uh... my friends,
they play in a band

281
00:15:17,064 --> 00:15:20,262
and they're playing a show
at Nemo's tonight.

282
00:15:20,264 --> 00:15:22,194
I thought, you know,
if you didn't have plans...

283
00:15:22,196 --> 00:15:23,162
"Head Injury"?

284
00:15:23,164 --> 00:15:25,028
Yeah, they're Seattle's
third most popular...

285
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,195
"Soundgarden tribute band."

286
00:15:26,197 --> 00:15:28,099
Yeah, I mean,
according to them. (laughs)

287
00:15:29,597 --> 00:15:30,795
EVE: That sounds like fun.

288
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:32,061
- DENNY: It does?
- Mmm-hmm.

289
00:15:32,063 --> 00:15:34,731
Yeah! Yeah, no, we'll...
we'll make it fun.

290
00:15:35,064 --> 00:15:37,063
- All right, I'll see you then.
- DENNY: Cool.

291
00:15:37,331 --> 00:15:38,398
EVE: Bye.

292
00:15:39,732 --> 00:15:40,933
DENNY: Come on.

293
00:15:42,265 --> 00:15:44,331
- I thought you guys rocked.
- See, Mike?

294
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,500
He was freaking out because
we skipped a verse on <i>Spoonman.</i>

295
00:15:46,865 --> 00:15:48,330
MIKE: Oh, we skipped a verse?

296
00:15:48,332 --> 00:15:50,997
Now imagine this
all throughout high school.

297
00:15:50,999 --> 00:15:52,600
So, which song was
your favorite?

298
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:54,931
The... second-to-last one.

299
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:56,897
The one with
the 12-minute guitar solo?

300
00:15:56,899 --> 00:15:58,398
Yeah, that was the best part!

301
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,630
(laughs) Denny, marry this girl.

302
00:16:00,632 --> 00:16:02,763
(chuckles) Uh,
do you want another?

303
00:16:02,765 --> 00:16:04,198
No, thanks.
Could I have some water?

304
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,667
- Yeah, sure. Mike?
- MIKE: Yep.

305
00:16:05,866 --> 00:16:08,064
So, uh... you two just met, huh?

306
00:16:08,066 --> 00:16:09,066
EVE: Yeah.

307
00:16:09,267 --> 00:16:10,800
- And?
- Dude.

308
00:16:11,066 --> 00:16:13,431
(chuckles) And I think
he's really nice.

309
00:16:13,433 --> 00:16:16,065
Wait till you see him race.
Then you'll really fall in love.

310
00:16:16,067 --> 00:16:16,968
Dude!

311
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,434
- What? I was just...
- (chuckles)

312
00:16:20,569 --> 00:16:22,232
So, when do I get
to see you race?

313
00:16:22,234 --> 00:16:23,066
(laughter)

314
00:16:23,268 --> 00:16:25,401
ENZO: <i>As if Denny
would ever fall for that.</i>

315
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,000
- (woman shouting)
- Yes!

316
00:16:28,368 --> 00:16:30,799
ENZO: <i>She knew almost nothing
about racing,</i>

317
00:16:30,801 --> 00:16:33,501
<i>but for some reason,
Denny didn't seem to mind.</i>

318
00:16:34,801 --> 00:16:37,466
<i>I assumed she would soon
be in our rearview mirror.</i>

319
00:16:37,468 --> 00:16:41,136
<i>But by spring, it was clear
Eve wasn't going anywhere.</i>

320
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:44,165
(all cheering)

321
00:16:44,167 --> 00:16:46,799
ENZO: <i>I'll admit I envied the
attention he lavished on her,</i>

322
00:16:46,801 --> 00:16:48,234
- <i>with her...</i>
- (laughs)

323
00:16:48,236 --> 00:16:50,902
<i>...opposable thumbs
and plump buttocks.</i>

324
00:16:54,536 --> 00:16:56,503
EVE: In his regular car, yes.

325
00:16:56,968 --> 00:16:59,136
well, what does he know
about teaching English?

326
00:17:00,469 --> 00:17:01,868
Yeah, my point exactly.

327
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:04,136
ENZO: <i>And her taste
in television programs</i>

328
00:17:04,138 --> 00:17:05,934
<i>left something to be desired.</i>

329
00:17:05,936 --> 00:17:07,938
EVE: Will you stop?

330
00:17:10,104 --> 00:17:12,270
ENZO: <i>Denny never tired
of pleasing her.</i>

331
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,368
<i>All for his reward,</i>

332
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,838
<i>which usually meant lots
of stroking and...</i>

333
00:17:21,171 --> 00:17:22,271
<i>nuzzling.</i>

334
00:17:24,937 --> 00:17:26,669
- How was your class?
- It was good.

335
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:28,935
ENZO: <i>Did I envy
her engaging smile?</i>

336
00:17:28,937 --> 00:17:30,906
<i>Her effortless laugh?</i>

337
00:17:31,305 --> 00:17:32,436
<i>Perhaps I did.</i>

338
00:17:32,438 --> 00:17:33,936
(Eve and Denny laughing)

339
00:17:33,938 --> 00:17:36,805
ENZO: <i>For she was a person,
unlike me.</i>

340
00:17:38,872 --> 00:17:40,538
DENNY: Mmm-hmm. (kissing)

341
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,604
I'll go make us some breakfast.

342
00:17:42,606 --> 00:17:44,073
- (gasps) Really?
- DENNY: Yeah.

343
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:45,439
Okay, thanks.

344
00:17:46,605 --> 00:17:47,740
(Eve sighs)

345
00:17:49,372 --> 00:17:50,340
Hey, Enzo.

346
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:55,973
You don't mind
if I love him too, do you?

347
00:17:56,806 --> 00:17:58,940
ENZO: <i>As if I had a say
in the matter.</i>

348
00:18:03,574 --> 00:18:05,971
ENZO: <i>They were married
at a magnificent palace</i>

349
00:18:05,973 --> 00:18:07,641
<i>with its very own ocean.</i>

350
00:18:08,307 --> 00:18:11,774
<i>The kind of place I had assumed
only existed on television.</i>

351
00:18:13,108 --> 00:18:15,174
<i>I tried my best to be helpful.</i>

352
00:18:15,608 --> 00:18:17,541
(indistinct chatter)

353
00:18:17,842 --> 00:18:19,238
<i>I minded my manners,</i>

354
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,906
<i>resisted snacking on the trays
of exquisite appetizers</i>

355
00:18:22,908 --> 00:18:24,240
<i>and made sure to do my business</i>

356
00:18:24,242 --> 00:18:27,109
<i>in the flowerbed farthest
from the festivities.</i>

357
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:31,309
<i>The place belonged
to Eve's parents,</i>

358
00:18:31,508 --> 00:18:33,041
<i>Trish and Maxwell...</i>

359
00:18:33,841 --> 00:18:36,807
<i>who I confess I first mistook
for twins.</i>

360
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:38,042
(indistinct chatter)

361
00:18:38,476 --> 00:18:41,010
Would the bearer please
bring the rings forward?

362
00:18:41,475 --> 00:18:42,473
Aww!

363
00:18:42,475 --> 00:18:43,840
(guests chuckling)

364
00:18:43,842 --> 00:18:44,809
ENZO: <i>When the time came,</i>

365
00:18:45,077 --> 00:18:47,244
<i>I did as I was instructed,
for Denny's sake.</i>

366
00:18:47,678 --> 00:18:48,877
(man chuckles)

367
00:18:49,842 --> 00:18:52,377
- Good boy.
- Come on, Enz. Come here, bud.

368
00:18:53,777 --> 00:18:54,911
DENNY: Hey.

369
00:18:55,577 --> 00:18:56,845
Good boy.

370
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:01,010
DENNY: With this ring,

371
00:19:01,211 --> 00:19:02,411
I thee wed.

372
00:19:03,278 --> 00:19:04,212
Eve?

373
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:06,112
EVE: With this ring,

374
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:07,512
I thee wed.

375
00:19:08,144 --> 00:19:09,243
(chuckles)

376
00:19:09,245 --> 00:19:10,642
(all cheering)

377
00:19:10,644 --> 00:19:12,478
ENZO: <i>And so, we became
a family...</i>

378
00:19:15,111 --> 00:19:17,544
<i>to varying degrees
of enthusiasm.</i>

379
00:19:17,778 --> 00:19:19,479
Think he could've shaved
for his own wedding?

380
00:19:19,745 --> 00:19:21,579
- Maxwell.
- MAXWELL: What?

381
00:19:21,778 --> 00:19:23,278
It's just an observation.

382
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,780
Oh, please.

383
00:19:25,245 --> 00:19:27,645
No one's good enough for her
in your eyes.

384
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,576
I like him, I do,

385
00:19:29,578 --> 00:19:31,012
but I love my daughter

386
00:19:31,346 --> 00:19:33,543
and the man races cars
for a living.

387
00:19:33,545 --> 00:19:34,844
You don't think
I'm within my rights

388
00:19:34,846 --> 00:19:37,480
- to be a little concerned?
- No, not if Eve isn't.

389
00:19:37,747 --> 00:19:39,111
ENZO: <i>I've learned
that people will say</i>

390
00:19:39,113 --> 00:19:41,344
<i>just about anything
in front of me,</i>

391
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,879
<i>as I am only a dumb dog.</i>

392
00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:45,345
I put a call in
to Andy Neuberger last week.

393
00:19:45,347 --> 00:19:47,145
He said a driver who's been
on the circuit

394
00:19:47,147 --> 00:19:49,645
as long as Denny has,
if it was gonna break for him,

395
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:51,582
most likely would've happened
by now.

396
00:19:51,781 --> 00:19:54,347
But Eve says he's been
doing great lately.

397
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,511
I knew I'd find you two in here.

398
00:19:56,513 --> 00:19:57,914
Come on, it's cake time.

399
00:19:58,181 --> 00:19:59,479
TRISH: Daddy was making
his drink.

400
00:19:59,481 --> 00:20:00,180
(both laugh)

401
00:20:00,448 --> 00:20:02,380
ENZO: <i>After the wedding came
the move.</i>

402
00:20:04,647 --> 00:20:05,848
(grunts)

403
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:08,381
ENZO: <i>I was of two minds
about it.</i>

404
00:20:09,015 --> 00:20:11,048
<i>I now had room to roam.</i>

405
00:20:11,481 --> 00:20:13,281
<i>But the old apartment was ours,</i>

406
00:20:13,616 --> 00:20:14,883
<i>Denny and me.</i>

407
00:20:15,249 --> 00:20:17,282
(indistinct chatter)

408
00:20:21,483 --> 00:20:22,484
(both laughing)

409
00:20:25,915 --> 00:20:28,049
ENZO: <i>I tried to communicate
my feelings.</i>

410
00:20:31,017 --> 00:20:33,150
- EVE: What was that?
- It was Enzo. He's just excited.

411
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:36,517
ENZO: <i>But my gestures
were inevitably misinterpreted.</i>

412
00:20:38,817 --> 00:20:40,151
(kissing)

413
00:20:42,383 --> 00:20:44,048
<i>Moreover, there was
a mysterious new aura</i>

414
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:46,147
<i>about Eve that, for some reason,</i>

415
00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:49,917
<i>prevented me from maintaining
any resentment toward her.</i>

416
00:21:01,084 --> 00:21:02,082
DENNY: It's Watkins Glen,

417
00:21:02,084 --> 00:21:03,249
which I usually do
really well at.

418
00:21:03,251 --> 00:21:04,550
EVE: And that's in New York,
right?

419
00:21:04,552 --> 00:21:05,582
Yeah. Yeah.

420
00:21:05,584 --> 00:21:06,916
You could take a couple days off

421
00:21:06,918 --> 00:21:08,317
and we could
get out there early.

422
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:09,319
I'm pregnant.

423
00:21:11,219 --> 00:21:13,053
Wait, what?

424
00:21:14,186 --> 00:21:15,250
You freaked out?

425
00:21:15,252 --> 00:21:17,420
No! No, I'm not!
Wait, are you freaked out?

426
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,320
A little, yeah.

427
00:21:20,118 --> 00:21:21,120
(chuckles)

428
00:21:23,254 --> 00:21:24,854
(Denny laughing)

429
00:21:25,286 --> 00:21:26,751
Did you know about this?

430
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:28,186
- (barks)
- (Denny laughs)

431
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:31,517
ENZO: <i>I never really grasped
the concept of money</i>

432
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:34,286
<i>and why humans always
seemed to be in need of it.</i>

433
00:21:35,353 --> 00:21:38,052
<i>But Denny became more and more
preoccupied with it.</i>

434
00:21:38,054 --> 00:21:39,852
- All right!
- (engine revving)

435
00:21:39,854 --> 00:21:41,854
ENZO: <i>He began to train harder
than ever.</i>

436
00:21:44,322 --> 00:21:46,552
<i>He took
on extra teaching sessions,</i>

437
00:21:46,554 --> 00:21:48,488
<i>competed in every race he could.</i>

438
00:21:49,155 --> 00:21:50,085
I'll miss you.

439
00:21:50,087 --> 00:21:51,620
ENZO: <i>This meant
my spending more</i>

440
00:21:51,622 --> 00:21:52,854
<i>and more time alone with Eve.</i>

441
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:55,455
- Come on, Enz. Come on.
- (car door closes)

442
00:21:58,821 --> 00:21:59,855
ENZO: <i>To be honest,</i>

443
00:22:00,155 --> 00:22:02,919
<i>I still didn't share
Denny's overt affection for her.</i>

444
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:05,086
Hey, buddy, thank you so much.

445
00:22:05,088 --> 00:22:06,186
(groans)

446
00:22:06,188 --> 00:22:08,521
ENZO: <i>But we developed
a rhythm of our own.</i>

447
00:22:08,856 --> 00:22:11,254
That's very nice. (sighs)

448
00:22:11,256 --> 00:22:13,853
ENZO: <i>At times, she even
reminded me of my own mother</i>

449
00:22:13,855 --> 00:22:15,954
<i>when she would sigh
and shrug herself</i>

450
00:22:15,956 --> 00:22:17,789
- <i>into a prone position.</i>
- (groans) Oh, God.

451
00:22:18,356 --> 00:22:20,820
ENZO: <i>It must be amazing
to have a body</i>

452
00:22:20,822 --> 00:22:23,022
<i>that can carry
an entire creature inside.</i>

453
00:22:23,489 --> 00:22:26,256
<i>I mean, other than a tapeworm,
which I've had.</i>

454
00:22:26,956 --> 00:22:28,957
Do you want to know
what it feels like?

455
00:22:33,724 --> 00:22:35,091
Good boy.

456
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,924
(gasps) Did you feel that?

457
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:39,824
Did you feel that kick?

458
00:22:40,657 --> 00:22:43,125
Oh, sweet boy, come here.

459
00:22:44,924 --> 00:22:46,891
It's okay. Come here.

460
00:22:47,257 --> 00:22:48,458
That's okay.

461
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:51,523
ENZO: <i>I couldn't imagine
what was going on</i>

462
00:22:51,525 --> 00:22:53,056
<i>inside Eve's magic sack</i>

463
00:22:53,058 --> 00:22:55,258
<i>where the baby
was being assembled.</i>

464
00:22:56,059 --> 00:22:58,226
<i>I just hoped it would look
like me.</i>

465
00:23:01,893 --> 00:23:03,457
(paper rustling)

466
00:23:03,459 --> 00:23:06,326
DENNY: Enzo... slow down,
it's your only one.

467
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,124
- EVE: It's cozy.
- DENNY: I love it.

468
00:23:09,126 --> 00:23:11,124
It probably looks exactly
like the last one

469
00:23:11,126 --> 00:23:12,493
- I got you, but...
- (laughing)

470
00:23:13,426 --> 00:23:14,658
Do you like it?

471
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,491
I got it from Pike Place.

472
00:23:16,493 --> 00:23:18,127
It's 100 percent handmade.

473
00:23:18,493 --> 00:23:19,656
(chuckles) It's, uh...

474
00:23:19,658 --> 00:23:21,127
Your favorite shade of pink.

475
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,391
- It is.
- (chuckles)

476
00:23:26,861 --> 00:23:28,261
- (exhales)
- You okay?

477
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,961
Yeah, I'm fine. I just want
to see what it looks like on.

478
00:23:32,394 --> 00:23:33,825
Hey, can we talk about

479
00:23:33,827 --> 00:23:35,593
this whole midwife thing again?

480
00:23:35,994 --> 00:23:38,791
- Honey, we've been over this.
- Yeah, I know.

481
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:39,726
I'm just saying.

482
00:23:39,993 --> 00:23:41,892
I mean, you know,
I was born in a hospital,

483
00:23:41,894 --> 00:23:43,026
you were born in a hospital.

484
00:23:43,028 --> 00:23:45,961
I know, but I really want
to do it here.

485
00:23:46,195 --> 00:23:48,462
EVE: I mean,
Tanya birthed her twins at home.

486
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:50,293
And she said that
these two women

487
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:51,527
she used were amazing.

488
00:23:51,529 --> 00:23:52,762
- Okay.
- (cell phone rings)

489
00:23:53,627 --> 00:23:55,028
- Hey.
- (phone ringing)

490
00:23:55,929 --> 00:23:57,530
Hi, Mom. Merry Chri...

491
00:23:58,295 --> 00:23:58,995
EVE: Okay.

492
00:23:59,429 --> 00:24:01,896
Someone from
something-something... Penske?

493
00:24:02,296 --> 00:24:03,330
On Christmas Day?

494
00:24:04,563 --> 00:24:05,764
DENNY: Hello.

495
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:08,797
- (laughs)
- DENNY: Yeah, hi.

496
00:24:09,429 --> 00:24:10,762
What is this hat?

497
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:13,228
ENZO: <i>They say dogs
can't see color.</i>

498
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:14,096
DENNY: Oh, Okay.

499
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:16,430
ENZO: <i>Apparently,
neither could Denny.</i>

500
00:24:17,064 --> 00:24:19,695
DENNY: Yeah, I'll, um,
hear back from you again, okay.

501
00:24:19,697 --> 00:24:20,830
DENNY: Bye.

502
00:24:22,131 --> 00:24:23,062
EVE. What is it?

503
00:24:23,064 --> 00:24:25,398
That was Judd Murphy
from Team Penske.

504
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:26,797
He's down a driver

505
00:24:27,198 --> 00:24:29,630
and he just offered me a seat
in the 24 Hours of Daytona.

506
00:24:29,863 --> 00:24:31,495
That's good, right?

507
00:24:31,497 --> 00:24:33,328
Good? I mean, it's great!

508
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:34,331
DENNY: It's Daytona.

509
00:24:34,632 --> 00:24:36,162
This is the shot
I've been wanting.

510
00:24:36,164 --> 00:24:37,897
DENNY: This could change
everything for me.

511
00:24:37,899 --> 00:24:39,695
Oh, my God, Denny, that's great!

512
00:24:39,697 --> 00:24:41,098
(barking)

513
00:24:41,731 --> 00:24:43,866
It's the last weekend
of January.

514
00:24:44,665 --> 00:24:47,030
So? The due date
isn't till February 15th.

515
00:24:47,032 --> 00:24:48,466
DENNY:
That's cutting it awful close.

516
00:24:49,265 --> 00:24:51,565
Hey, what if you came
with me? Huh?

517
00:24:51,999 --> 00:24:53,797
We don't have to fly.

518
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:56,565
Denny. I'm not driving
to Florida.

519
00:24:57,298 --> 00:24:59,564
- (Denny sighs)
- But you have to do this.

520
00:24:59,566 --> 00:25:00,798
There is nothing to debate here.

521
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,330
This is your shot.

522
00:25:02,332 --> 00:25:03,531
If you finish well,

523
00:25:03,533 --> 00:25:05,134
all these doors start to open.

524
00:25:06,266 --> 00:25:08,833
You're not worried
about timing... at all?

525
00:25:09,534 --> 00:25:12,201
When have you known me
to be early for anything?

526
00:25:13,033 --> 00:25:15,465
(groaning and screaming)

527
00:25:15,467 --> 00:25:18,335
ENZO: <i>I didn't know a human
could make such sounds.</i>

528
00:25:19,168 --> 00:25:21,902
(Eve screaming)

529
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,833
ENZO: <i>Denny missed it
all however,</i>

530
00:25:23,835 --> 00:25:26,000
<i>as he was driving through
the night at Daytona.</i>

531
00:25:26,366 --> 00:25:28,100
ANNOUNCER: (on TV)
<i>Denny Swift in the #22 car</i>

532
00:25:28,102 --> 00:25:30,099
<i>putting in
a tremendous performance,</i>

533
00:25:30,101 --> 00:25:31,665
<i>considering the team was
in 10th place.</i>

534
00:25:31,667 --> 00:25:33,400
MIDWIFE:
You're doing wonderfully, Eve.

535
00:25:33,402 --> 00:25:34,901
(Eve screaming)

536
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:36,499
ANNOUNCER: (on TV)
<i>Approaching hour 17</i>

537
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:39,132
<i>of this marathon race,
and the rain is really pouring.</i>

538
00:25:39,134 --> 00:25:40,899
EVE: I want to talk to Denny.
Can you call him?

539
00:25:40,901 --> 00:25:42,101
MIDWIFE:
Just keep pushing, okay?

540
00:25:42,468 --> 00:25:44,299
ANNOUNCER: <i>With Swift back
in the #22 car,</i>

541
00:25:44,301 --> 00:25:46,533
<i>he's snapping at the heels
of car #17.</i>

542
00:25:46,535 --> 00:25:47,734
MIDWIFE: One more push.

543
00:25:47,736 --> 00:25:50,669
(screaming)

544
00:25:51,069 --> 00:25:53,801
ANNOUNCER: <i>Unbelievable!
Denny Swift has taken the lead</i>

545
00:25:53,803 --> 00:25:56,269
<i>in a magnificent show of skill.</i>

546
00:25:57,069 --> 00:26:00,137
- (baby crying)
- Oh, hi, sweet girl.

547
00:26:01,736 --> 00:26:03,135
You're nice and warm.

548
00:26:03,137 --> 00:26:05,201
MIDWIFE: All right. We'll give
you two some time alone.

549
00:26:05,203 --> 00:26:07,337
- Thank you.
- (chuckles) You're welcome.

550
00:26:08,671 --> 00:26:09,938
Oh! Shoo now, pup!

551
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:12,037
No, he can stay.

552
00:26:12,736 --> 00:26:14,471
Yeah. Oh...

553
00:26:15,805 --> 00:26:17,071
EVE: Enzo.

554
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:18,936
ENZO: <i>The scent was...</i>

555
00:26:18,938 --> 00:26:20,304
<i>unprecedented.</i>

556
00:26:21,138 --> 00:26:24,172
Come here, sweet boy. Come here.

557
00:26:26,538 --> 00:26:30,103
ENZO: <i>I had never encountered
a creature quite so beautiful.</i>

558
00:26:30,105 --> 00:26:31,239
Zoë...

559
00:26:31,805 --> 00:26:33,239
this is Enzo.

560
00:26:34,272 --> 00:26:35,806
He's your family, too.

561
00:26:37,606 --> 00:26:39,405
And he'll always protect you.

562
00:26:41,206 --> 00:26:42,106
(baby coos)

563
00:26:47,807 --> 00:26:49,406
- (brakes screech)
- (Enzo barking)

564
00:26:51,873 --> 00:26:52,974
(Enzo barking)

565
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,906
DENNY: Hey, how is everything?
She's okay?

566
00:26:59,908 --> 00:27:02,205
Hi! She's fine.
Yes, just fine. (laughs)

567
00:27:02,207 --> 00:27:03,705
- DENNY: Hey.
- (Trish sighs)

568
00:27:03,707 --> 00:27:04,974
DENNY: Yeah.

569
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,941
She's been waiting
for her daddy.

570
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,374
I should've been here.

571
00:27:14,608 --> 00:27:15,840
EVE: Honey, she's a day old.

572
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,509
DENNY: I know, but still...

573
00:27:19,275 --> 00:27:20,475
You're here now.

574
00:27:24,341 --> 00:27:25,775
EVE: This is why we met.

575
00:27:28,276 --> 00:27:30,276
To make
this perfect little thing.

576
00:27:33,441 --> 00:27:35,342
- (kisses)
- (Zoë coos)

577
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:39,277
EVE: I still don't understand.

578
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:41,843
DENNY: We lost.
It's no big deal.

579
00:27:44,543 --> 00:27:47,176
We were leading by a lap
going into the last stint.

580
00:27:47,409 --> 00:27:51,409
And... I told Murph
I felt up to finishing, but...

581
00:27:51,677 --> 00:27:53,175
the sponsors were pressuring him

582
00:27:53,177 --> 00:27:56,142
to go with this
wonder kid from California

583
00:27:56,144 --> 00:27:58,178
who'd been doing
a bunch of press lately.

584
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:01,342
Ten minutes in,
the kid hit the wall.

585
00:28:01,344 --> 00:28:02,478
Totaled the car.

586
00:28:04,812 --> 00:28:06,243
But you drove well.

587
00:28:07,078 --> 00:28:08,941
Yeah, it doesn't really mean
a whole lot

588
00:28:08,943 --> 00:28:10,246
if your team doesn't finish.

589
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:12,345
It's okay.

590
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:15,246
Really.
There's gonna be other races.

591
00:28:19,212 --> 00:28:20,312
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

592
00:28:29,811 --> 00:28:31,879
Oh, Zoë. You okay?

593
00:28:35,612 --> 00:28:37,411
Where is she?
It's been too long!

594
00:28:37,413 --> 00:28:39,011
(both laughing)

595
00:28:39,013 --> 00:28:40,478
ENZO: <i>The twins,
who rarely visited,</i>

596
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,410
<i>now stopped by frequently
to clutter our home</i>

597
00:28:43,412 --> 00:28:44,546
<i>with garish gifts.</i>

598
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,645
<i>Denny pretended not to mind,</i>

599
00:28:47,647 --> 00:28:49,045
<i>but something about the zebra</i>

600
00:28:49,047 --> 00:28:50,481
<i>put me ill at ease.</i>

601
00:28:51,347 --> 00:28:52,981
Look at those pretty eyes.

602
00:28:53,347 --> 00:28:54,378
Hello, baby girl.

603
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,279
- Dad, she needs a change.
- Oh, I'll do it!

604
00:28:56,281 --> 00:28:57,982
- EVE: Yeah?
- (Trish chuckling)

605
00:28:58,947 --> 00:29:00,814
Yeah, Grandma's got you.

606
00:29:01,214 --> 00:29:02,214
Denny!

607
00:29:03,913 --> 00:29:06,114
- It's coming along.
- Thanks.

608
00:29:08,014 --> 00:29:10,412
I watched some of that race
of yours, by the way.

609
00:29:10,414 --> 00:29:12,679
How's that boy doing,
the one who crashed?

610
00:29:12,681 --> 00:29:14,815
We've had
this conversation before.

611
00:29:17,148 --> 00:29:18,581
Still, you have a daughter now.

612
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:21,482
MAXWELL: Say, for instance,
you get seriously injured,

613
00:29:21,815 --> 00:29:23,216
or God forbid, killed...

614
00:29:23,549 --> 00:29:25,514
- I won't.
- You can't promise that.

615
00:29:25,516 --> 00:29:26,749
Yes, I can.

616
00:29:27,282 --> 00:29:30,048
I promise you
that I will always provide

617
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:31,815
for Eve and Zoë,
no matter what.

618
00:29:31,817 --> 00:29:35,215
And I swear to you
that I will put my safety first,

619
00:29:35,217 --> 00:29:38,350
even if that means
losing every race that I enter.

620
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,950
TRISH: Bye. Bye, honey.
Love you.

621
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:47,551
(door closes)

622
00:29:48,284 --> 00:29:50,115
ENZO: <i>It amazed me,
the power exerted</i>

623
00:29:50,117 --> 00:29:52,918
<i>by a creature as tiny
as our little Zoë.</i>

624
00:29:55,685 --> 00:29:58,185
<i>A power she wielded
over me as well...</i>

625
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,782
<i>with no more effort</i>

626
00:30:00,784 --> 00:30:03,152
<i>than the earth
does the moon in its orbit.</i>

627
00:30:04,785 --> 00:30:06,819
(indistinct chattering)

628
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:13,920
(Zoë cooing and laughing)

629
00:30:16,352 --> 00:30:19,219
ENZO: <i>I was an integral figure
in her entertainment,</i>

630
00:30:19,785 --> 00:30:21,651
<i>leaping after tennis balls</i>

631
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,683
<i>and scrambling back
to catch them</i>

632
00:30:23,685 --> 00:30:25,816
<i>then dancing
like a four-legged clown</i>

633
00:30:25,818 --> 00:30:27,185
<i>to catch them again.</i>

634
00:30:27,687 --> 00:30:28,784
- Run!
- (Enzo barks)

635
00:30:28,786 --> 00:30:29,885
DENNY: Whoa!

636
00:30:29,887 --> 00:30:31,218
(Eve laughing)

637
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,652
- You ready, birthday girl?
- (giggling)

638
00:30:32,654 --> 00:30:33,751
Okay, here we go.

639
00:30:33,753 --> 00:30:35,186
ENZO: <i>I was so immersed
in her world</i>

640
00:30:35,188 --> 00:30:37,685
<i>that I'd lose count
of the weeks and months.</i>

641
00:30:37,687 --> 00:30:40,553
DENNY AND EVE:
Ready, steady...

642
00:30:40,954 --> 00:30:42,488
- go!
- (Zoë inhales sharply)

643
00:30:43,555 --> 00:30:44,786
(all cheering)

644
00:30:44,788 --> 00:30:46,518
ENZO: <i>And when she would
tell her playmates</i>

645
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,085
<i>that I was her big brother,</i>

646
00:30:48,087 --> 00:30:50,089
<i>my heart would swell with pride.</i>

647
00:30:51,287 --> 00:30:52,552
Hot potato!

648
00:30:52,554 --> 00:30:53,588
- EVE: Whoa!
- (Zoë laughing)

649
00:30:53,922 --> 00:30:55,651
- Ahh!
- Stinky Drawers!

650
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:56,886
DENNY: Oh! She's coming in.

651
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:58,289
Go! She's coming in hot!

652
00:30:58,754 --> 00:31:00,089
Good boy.

653
00:31:00,621 --> 00:31:01,854
(Zoë giggling)

654
00:31:01,856 --> 00:31:03,055
(Denny laughing)

655
00:31:09,189 --> 00:31:11,588
ZOË: Everyone has to wait
their turn for a snack,

656
00:31:11,822 --> 00:31:13,022
even zebras.

657
00:31:13,222 --> 00:31:14,323
Right, teacher?

658
00:31:14,922 --> 00:31:16,454
- Daddy!
- Hi!

659
00:31:16,456 --> 00:31:17,723
(grunts)

660
00:31:17,988 --> 00:31:19,788
Hey, I'm sorry I missed
your dance recital.

661
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:21,186
Mommy told me all about it.

662
00:31:21,188 --> 00:31:23,956
- Did you win?
- No, sweet pea, not this one.

663
00:31:25,589 --> 00:31:26,754
- ZOË: Better?
- (chuckles)

664
00:31:26,756 --> 00:31:28,358
- You have no idea.
- (giggles)

665
00:31:29,723 --> 00:31:30,723
(grunts)

666
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:33,157
Thanks for taking care
of our girls, Enz.

667
00:31:34,557 --> 00:31:36,421
Okay, so what do we got here?

668
00:31:36,423 --> 00:31:38,791
ZOË: Well, this is
my second-grade class.

669
00:31:40,225 --> 00:31:41,789
DENNY: Feels like I'm always
at the track

670
00:31:41,791 --> 00:31:43,090
or getting on a plane.

671
00:31:43,758 --> 00:31:45,756
EVE: Feels that way
for me too sometimes.

672
00:31:45,758 --> 00:31:47,023
(pills clatter)

673
00:31:47,025 --> 00:31:48,793
It'll get easier.

674
00:31:49,358 --> 00:31:50,492
You okay?

675
00:31:50,758 --> 00:31:53,191
Just a headache.
I was up late grading papers.

676
00:31:58,292 --> 00:32:00,526
It wasn't supposed
to take this long, you know.

677
00:32:01,292 --> 00:32:03,826
Dream's always been Formula One,
but it feels...

678
00:32:04,093 --> 00:32:07,293
like I'm just kind
of treading water.

679
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:08,526
Hey...

680
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,324
no race was ever won
on the first corner.

681
00:32:11,326 --> 00:32:13,294
(chuckles softly) Yeah.

682
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:16,227
You still love it, don't you?

683
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:18,127
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

684
00:32:20,892 --> 00:32:22,460
Maybe that's not enough.

685
00:32:23,694 --> 00:32:25,028
I don't know.

686
00:32:27,427 --> 00:32:30,828
Apex offered me a seat
at Laguna Seca for next weekend.

687
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,994
I told them I needed to think
about it.

688
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,561
You're just tired.

689
00:32:37,294 --> 00:32:38,295
Yeah.

690
00:32:44,761 --> 00:32:46,825
ENZO: <i>I spent a sleepless night
contemplating</i>

691
00:32:46,827 --> 00:32:48,162
<i>what Denny had said.</i>

692
00:32:49,162 --> 00:32:50,127
<i>Quit racing?</i>

693
00:32:50,362 --> 00:32:53,228
<i>He was a racecar driver
the way I was a dog.</i>

694
00:32:54,428 --> 00:32:55,530
<i>It was his nature.</i>

695
00:32:56,262 --> 00:32:57,395
<i>His destiny.</i>

696
00:33:01,028 --> 00:33:02,627
MAN: (on TV) <i>According
to Mongolian folklore,</i>

697
00:33:02,629 --> 00:33:05,094
<i>the dogs are able to see
into the spirit world...</i>

698
00:33:05,096 --> 00:33:06,693
EVE: Zoë, honey, dinner's ready!

699
00:33:06,695 --> 00:33:08,262
I want to wait for Daddy.

700
00:33:08,497 --> 00:33:09,963
EVE: Daddy's teaching tonight.

701
00:33:10,296 --> 00:33:12,461
- Five more minutes?
- EVE: Ugh!

702
00:33:12,463 --> 00:33:14,264
Okay. Enzo, dinner!

703
00:33:14,563 --> 00:33:15,563
Yes!

704
00:33:28,698 --> 00:33:29,829
ENZO: <i>And then all my worries</i>

705
00:33:29,831 --> 00:33:32,132
<i>about Denny were eclipsed
by a smell.</i>

706
00:33:33,232 --> 00:33:36,132
<i>An odor coming from her ears
and sinuses like...</i>

707
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:37,698
<i>decay.</i>

708
00:33:37,897 --> 00:33:39,265
<i>Like rotting wood.</i>

709
00:33:45,965 --> 00:33:48,363
<i>Given a facile tongue,
I could have warned her.</i>

710
00:33:48,365 --> 00:33:50,298
Don't give me
a hard time, too, buddy.

711
00:33:50,765 --> 00:33:54,498
ENZO: <i>Instead, all I could do
was watch and feel empty inside</i>

712
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,400
<i>because there was nothing
I could do to help her.</i>

713
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,898
<i>In the zebra's mute stare,</i>

714
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:04,332
<i>I could sense it mocking
my predicament.</i>

715
00:34:05,299 --> 00:34:07,967
<i>Eve had assigned me
to protect Zoë.</i>

716
00:34:08,432 --> 00:34:09,933
(exhales softly)

717
00:34:11,468 --> 00:34:14,130
<i>But no one had been
assigned to protect Eve.</i>

718
00:34:14,132 --> 00:34:16,333
(car door opens and closes)

719
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:28,766
(barking)

720
00:34:28,768 --> 00:34:31,435
Hey, hey, shh.
You're gonna wake up Zoë.

721
00:34:33,568 --> 00:34:34,569
Come on.

722
00:34:35,601 --> 00:34:37,802
(car revving on TV)

723
00:34:41,634 --> 00:34:43,569
Since when do you
watch my in-cars?

724
00:34:43,901 --> 00:34:45,233
How come you go through
the turns

725
00:34:45,235 --> 00:34:47,403
so much faster than
the other cars?

726
00:34:47,735 --> 00:34:48,736
Well...

727
00:34:49,168 --> 00:34:50,933
most drivers are afraid
of the rain,

728
00:34:50,935 --> 00:34:52,636
because it's
an unpredictable element.

729
00:34:52,837 --> 00:34:54,370
They're forced to react to it.

730
00:34:55,702 --> 00:34:57,802
And if they're reacting
at speed...

731
00:34:58,169 --> 00:35:01,336
then they're probably too late,
so they should be afraid of it.

732
00:35:01,704 --> 00:35:03,737
Well, I'm afraid
just watching it.

733
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:06,534
Yeah, but if you intentionally
make the car do something,

734
00:35:06,536 --> 00:35:07,901
you don't have to predict.

735
00:35:07,903 --> 00:35:09,370
You control the outcome.

736
00:35:09,738 --> 00:35:12,201
So, you skid the car
before it skids itself?

737
00:35:12,203 --> 00:35:13,204
Yeah.

738
00:35:13,804 --> 00:35:14,901
Yeah.

739
00:35:14,903 --> 00:35:16,669
When I'm in a racecar,

740
00:35:16,671 --> 00:35:18,937
I'm the creator
of my own destiny.

741
00:35:20,237 --> 00:35:22,539
"That which you manifest
is before you."

742
00:35:24,604 --> 00:35:25,804
Create your own conditions

743
00:35:26,038 --> 00:35:27,505
and rain is just rain.

744
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:30,937
(Denny chuckles softly)

745
00:35:31,972 --> 00:35:34,637
Tomorrow morning you're gonna
call the folks at Apex

746
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:35,670
and you're gonna tell them

747
00:35:35,672 --> 00:35:37,505
that you'll see them
in Laguna Seca.

748
00:35:39,771 --> 00:35:41,871
And you can't give up, not ever.

749
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:43,140
Not for us.

750
00:35:43,505 --> 00:35:44,872
Not for anyone.

751
00:35:45,373 --> 00:35:46,439
EVE: Promise me.

752
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,274
I promise.

753
00:35:51,373 --> 00:35:52,140
ENZO: <i>At that moment,</i>

754
00:35:52,372 --> 00:35:54,504
<i>I finally understood
Denny's love for Eve</i>

755
00:35:54,506 --> 00:35:55,805
<i>and why for so long</i>

756
00:35:55,807 --> 00:35:57,573
<i>I had been afraid
to love her myself.</i>

757
00:35:59,906 --> 00:36:02,441
<i>She was
my unpredictable element.</i>

758
00:36:04,306 --> 00:36:05,574
<i>She was my rain.</i>

759
00:36:13,007 --> 00:36:14,573
ANNOUNCER: <i>It's looking
to be a beautiful day here</i>

760
00:36:14,575 --> 00:36:17,905
<i>at Laguna Seca Raceway
in Salinas, California.</i>

761
00:36:17,907 --> 00:36:20,539
<i>We have a deep field
of 43 GT cars</i>

762
00:36:20,541 --> 00:36:21,939
<i>and an impressive roster</i>

763
00:36:21,941 --> 00:36:23,809
- <i>of drivers.</i>
- (object clatters)

764
00:36:24,841 --> 00:36:26,875
(Eve retching)

765
00:36:27,808 --> 00:36:29,241
(sniffling)

766
00:36:30,642 --> 00:36:31,874
(clears throat)

767
00:36:31,876 --> 00:36:33,442
(continues retching)

768
00:36:34,175 --> 00:36:35,872
- Mommy?
- EVE: Go pack your bag.

769
00:36:35,874 --> 00:36:37,074
We're gonna
to Grandma and Grandpa's

770
00:36:37,076 --> 00:36:39,376
for a few days
until Daddy gets home. Okay?

771
00:36:39,874 --> 00:36:41,606
Are you feeling sick?

772
00:36:41,608 --> 00:36:44,275
I just really need to rest.

773
00:36:44,277 --> 00:36:45,243
EVE: Please?

774
00:36:48,244 --> 00:36:50,243
(groaning)

775
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:54,408
(retching)

776
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:55,410
(coughs)

777
00:36:57,209 --> 00:36:58,041
Come on.

778
00:36:58,043 --> 00:37:00,177
ENZO: <i>It all happened so fast.</i>

779
00:37:01,477 --> 00:37:02,641
(door lock clicks)

780
00:37:02,643 --> 00:37:04,477
<i>In five minutes they were gone.</i>

781
00:37:05,444 --> 00:37:06,878
<i>But I wasn't gone.</i>

782
00:37:07,412 --> 00:37:08,912
<i>I was still there.</i>

783
00:37:10,378 --> 00:37:13,878
<i>Denny always said panic's
a driver's worst enemy.</i>

784
00:37:14,644 --> 00:37:15,976
<i>So, I did not panic.</i>

785
00:37:15,978 --> 00:37:18,410
<i>I did not overcorrect or freeze,</i>

786
00:37:19,012 --> 00:37:20,910
<i>even though I knew
Denny wouldn't be home</i>

787
00:37:20,912 --> 00:37:22,812
<i>for at least another two days.</i>

788
00:37:25,312 --> 00:37:26,512
<i>But I'm a dog.</i>

789
00:37:26,846 --> 00:37:29,242
<i>And when God denied dogs
the use of thumbs,</i>

790
00:37:29,244 --> 00:37:30,877
<i>He gave us the ability
to survive</i>

791
00:37:30,879 --> 00:37:33,179
<i>without food
for extended periods.</i>

792
00:37:39,546 --> 00:37:41,843
<i>So, although a thumb
would've been very helpful,</i>

793
00:37:41,845 --> 00:37:44,413
<i>allowing me to turn a doorknob,
for instance,</i>

794
00:37:45,246 --> 00:37:47,378
<i>my second-best tool
was my ability</i>

795
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,581
<i>to go without food.</i>

796
00:37:51,314 --> 00:37:53,179
<i>The longer
my isolation continued,</i>

797
00:37:53,181 --> 00:37:55,148
<i>the more anxious I became.</i>

798
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:00,147
- <i>What if Denny never returned?</i>
- (indistinct chatter on TV)

799
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:04,979
<i>With only a limited supply
of drinking water,</i>

800
00:38:04,981 --> 00:38:06,211
<i>I had no way of knowing</i>

801
00:38:06,213 --> 00:38:08,282
<i>how long I'd have
to make it last.</i>

802
00:38:11,947 --> 00:38:14,680
<i>I sustained myself
with the odd stray Cheerio</i>

803
00:38:14,682 --> 00:38:16,115
<i>Zoë had dropped...</i>

804
00:38:17,849 --> 00:38:19,114
<i>and suffered the indignity</i>

805
00:38:19,116 --> 00:38:21,249
<i>of relieving myself
on the mat...</i>

806
00:38:21,683 --> 00:38:23,616
<i>waiting for my ordeal to end.</i>

807
00:38:23,849 --> 00:38:25,082
(car door closes)

808
00:38:27,483 --> 00:38:29,384
(barking)

809
00:38:34,015 --> 00:38:36,116
(thunder rumbling)

810
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:40,181
ENZO: <i>It was roughly 40 hours
into my solitude</i>

811
00:38:40,183 --> 00:38:42,317
<i>when I think
I began to hallucinate.</i>

812
00:38:44,049 --> 00:38:46,715
<i>I'd just discovered
some remnants of spilled yogurt</i>

813
00:38:46,717 --> 00:38:48,116
<i>when I heard a noise.</i>

814
00:38:48,384 --> 00:38:49,818
(thudding)

815
00:39:01,551 --> 00:39:03,553
(rock music playing)

816
00:39:13,418 --> 00:39:14,986
<i>It was the zebra.</i>

817
00:39:18,852 --> 00:39:20,253
(barks and growls)

818
00:39:25,385 --> 00:39:26,317
<i>I stalked the creature</i>

819
00:39:26,319 --> 00:39:28,917
<i>as it performed
its brutal burlesque</i>

820
00:39:28,919 --> 00:39:30,184
<i>not sure how much more</i>

821
00:39:30,186 --> 00:39:31,920
- <i>I could abide.</i>
- (toy squeaks)

822
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:34,550
(barks and growls)

823
00:39:34,552 --> 00:39:35,554
(fabric rips)

824
00:39:36,386 --> 00:39:37,619
(laughs)

825
00:39:37,621 --> 00:39:38,921
(growling)

826
00:39:43,888 --> 00:39:45,088
(snarling)

827
00:39:46,253 --> 00:39:47,453
(laughs mockingly)

828
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:54,986
ENZO: <i>I ran out, hoping what
I had seen was only in my mind,</i>

829
00:39:54,988 --> 00:39:57,556
<i>a demonic vision
driven by lack of glucose.</i>

830
00:39:59,922 --> 00:40:01,923
(thunder rumbling)

831
00:40:03,189 --> 00:40:05,254
<i>But somehow,
I knew that it was true</i>

832
00:40:05,256 --> 00:40:07,588
<i>and that something terrible
had happened.</i>

833
00:40:10,021 --> 00:40:12,322
(TV playing in background)

834
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,290
(keys jingle)

835
00:40:23,789 --> 00:40:24,924
Anyone home?

836
00:40:27,523 --> 00:40:28,691
Enz, hey.

837
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:30,788
What are you doing? Come here.

838
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:32,055
(Enzo grunts softly)

839
00:40:32,057 --> 00:40:33,390
DENNY: Enzo, come here!

840
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:35,290
(whines)

841
00:40:36,924 --> 00:40:38,858
Come here, bud. Hey.

842
00:40:43,824 --> 00:40:45,058
What happened?

843
00:40:45,524 --> 00:40:46,458
Where is everyone?

844
00:40:47,725 --> 00:40:48,926
Eve?

845
00:40:50,724 --> 00:40:52,425
Are Eve and Zoë still there?

846
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,326
Can I talk to her?

847
00:40:57,724 --> 00:41:00,392
Yeah. I'm at the house.
Enzo is here.

848
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:04,656
Wait, Eve, wait, hold...

849
00:41:04,658 --> 00:41:06,526
He's been here the whole time?

850
00:41:06,758 --> 00:41:08,558
DENNY: I thought you took him
with you!

851
00:41:08,926 --> 00:41:11,494
No, I got to go.
I got to take care of him.

852
00:41:13,858 --> 00:41:16,193
The mat was the only place
you used, huh?

853
00:41:16,727 --> 00:41:18,027
Come here, bud.

854
00:41:18,526 --> 00:41:19,527
There you go.

855
00:41:22,993 --> 00:41:25,659
- ZOË: Daddy, I missed you!
- DENNY: Oh! I missed you, too.

856
00:41:25,961 --> 00:41:27,391
ZOË: Can I say hi to my animals?

857
00:41:27,393 --> 00:41:28,528
DENNY: Yeah, go up.

858
00:41:29,561 --> 00:41:30,994
I'm just trying to understand.

859
00:41:31,427 --> 00:41:34,460
Ugh. I felt so sick
I wasn't thinking.

860
00:41:34,994 --> 00:41:37,428
The doctor thinks
it's maybe something viral.

861
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,194
Hi, buddy. Hi.

862
00:41:40,494 --> 00:41:42,225
Enz, I'm so sorry.

863
00:41:42,227 --> 00:41:43,958
- I'm so sorry.
- (Zoë screams)

864
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,793
(gasps) Zoë?

865
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:47,995
ZOË: Something happened
to my animals!

866
00:41:51,696 --> 00:41:53,393
- (Zoë crying)
- DENNY: This is a mess.

867
00:41:53,395 --> 00:41:55,527
I don't understand
why he'd do this.

868
00:41:55,529 --> 00:41:56,595
Zoë, stop crying.

869
00:41:56,794 --> 00:41:58,329
I'm gonna go find him.

870
00:41:59,695 --> 00:42:00,629
Get over here.

871
00:42:01,196 --> 00:42:02,793
- Get over here!
- (whines)

872
00:42:02,795 --> 00:42:04,595
Bad dog! Come on!

873
00:42:04,929 --> 00:42:06,929
Look what you did.
Look what you did!

874
00:42:07,195 --> 00:42:09,529
DENNY: You see that?
Why would you do that?

875
00:42:10,564 --> 00:42:11,860
DENNY: Bad dog!

876
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:14,095
- You stupid dog!
- Denny, stop!

877
00:42:14,097 --> 00:42:15,463
EVE: What are you doing?

878
00:42:18,597 --> 00:42:20,030
ENZO: <i>I had only one thought:</i>

879
00:42:20,497 --> 00:42:22,462
<i>The zebra must have
reassembled itself</i>

880
00:42:22,464 --> 00:42:25,430
<i>and attacked the remaining
animals after I left.</i>

881
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:29,132
<i>I should've destroyed the demon
when I had the chance.</i>

882
00:42:29,531 --> 00:42:32,098
<i>I should've eaten it,
even if it killed me.</i>

883
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:34,832
(Zoë sobbing)

884
00:42:52,331 --> 00:42:53,865
I'm so sorry, Enz.

885
00:42:55,333 --> 00:42:57,233
I promise I'll never do
that again.

886
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:00,933
DENNY: You're a tough old dog.

887
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,330
Come on.

888
00:43:06,332 --> 00:43:07,333
Come on.

889
00:43:12,533 --> 00:43:14,100
I won, by the way.

890
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,299
Like first in class?

891
00:43:16,667 --> 00:43:17,798
First overall.

892
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,564
- (gasping)
- Plus, a permanent seat

893
00:43:19,566 --> 00:43:20,664
in the Apex prototype.

894
00:43:20,666 --> 00:43:22,731
EVE: Oh, my God, Denny!
Oh, my God!

895
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:23,998
(laughs) They want me down
in Sonoma

896
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,599
to start training
with the team right away.

897
00:43:25,601 --> 00:43:26,768
I'm so proud of you.

898
00:43:27,167 --> 00:43:28,735
I was thinking
we could all go on the road?

899
00:43:29,001 --> 00:43:30,833
- Yes.
- Maybe at least for the summer?

900
00:43:30,835 --> 00:43:32,902
Yeah, go to all the races
and everything?

901
00:43:34,201 --> 00:43:36,800
ENZO: <i>In racing, your car goes
where your eyes go.</i>

902
00:43:37,401 --> 00:43:39,733
<i>A driver who cannot tear
his gaze from the wall</i>

903
00:43:39,735 --> 00:43:41,935
<i>will inevitably meet that wall.</i>

904
00:43:42,367 --> 00:43:43,932
<i>But the driver
who looks down the track</i>

905
00:43:43,934 --> 00:43:46,168
<i>as he feels
his tires break free,</i>

906
00:43:46,436 --> 00:43:48,466
<i>that driver
will maintain control</i>

907
00:43:48,468 --> 00:43:50,002
<i>of his car and his destiny.</i>

908
00:43:50,468 --> 00:43:53,269
<i>I realized this was
what Denny had done.</i>

909
00:43:53,635 --> 00:43:55,169
<i>He had manifested a win</i>

910
00:43:55,603 --> 00:43:57,400
<i>because he knew we needed one.</i>

911
00:43:57,402 --> 00:43:59,069
(indistinct chatter)

912
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:02,136
EVE: Keys.

913
00:44:03,802 --> 00:44:06,400
- Okay. I'll call you tonight.
- Okay.

914
00:44:06,402 --> 00:44:08,503
Bye, bud. Hey, kiddo,
I need that.

915
00:44:08,737 --> 00:44:10,405
(chuckles) Let's see.

916
00:44:11,669 --> 00:44:13,437
Thank you. Thank you.

917
00:44:14,437 --> 00:44:15,669
- Have fun.
- Bye.

918
00:44:15,671 --> 00:44:16,605
ZOË: Bye, Daddy!

919
00:44:22,804 --> 00:44:25,005
(cell phone ringing)

920
00:44:25,937 --> 00:44:27,169
- Hi, Mom.
- TRISH: (on phone) <i>Hi.</i>

921
00:44:27,171 --> 00:44:28,736
<i>I wanted to see
how you're feeling.</i>

922
00:44:28,738 --> 00:44:30,337
I'm fine. Much better.

923
00:44:30,339 --> 00:44:32,737
I'm taking Enzo for a hike
while Zoë's at school.

924
00:44:32,739 --> 00:44:34,739
I need to get into shape,
I feel so gross.

925
00:44:35,138 --> 00:44:37,371
TRISH: <i>Honey,
you're frail as a whippet.</i>

926
00:44:37,938 --> 00:44:39,503
<i>Is Denny out of town again?</i>

927
00:44:39,505 --> 00:44:42,304
Mom, I'm not getting into this.
I hear enough about it from Dad.

928
00:44:42,306 --> 00:44:44,604
TRISH: <i>Sweetheart,
I'm really just asking.</i>

929
00:44:44,606 --> 00:44:45,507
I know.

930
00:44:46,106 --> 00:44:48,540
Um, I got to go.
I'll call you later. I love you.

931
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:50,440
- TRISH: <i>I love you.</i>
- Bye.

932
00:44:51,273 --> 00:44:52,240
(sighs)

933
00:45:02,039 --> 00:45:03,473
(exhales sharply)

934
00:45:12,808 --> 00:45:15,108
(breathing heavily)

935
00:45:22,308 --> 00:45:23,241
It's okay.

936
00:45:24,541 --> 00:45:25,875
I'm okay.

937
00:45:53,377 --> 00:45:55,376
(barking)

938
00:46:05,977 --> 00:46:08,375
ENZO: <i>There are moments
when the urge to speak</i>

939
00:46:08,377 --> 00:46:09,441
<i>is truly maddening.</i>

940
00:46:09,443 --> 00:46:11,445
(Enzo continues barking)

941
00:46:14,679 --> 00:46:16,979
(sirens wailing)

942
00:46:22,411 --> 00:46:23,878
WOMAN: There's a number.

943
00:46:26,411 --> 00:46:28,879
ENZO: <i>Sometimes I hate
what I am.</i>

944
00:46:44,414 --> 00:46:45,847
DENNY: Hey, come on.

945
00:46:48,846 --> 00:46:50,048
Come here.

946
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,447
Yeah... she's gonna be okay.

947
00:46:59,213 --> 00:47:01,613
- Appreciate this, Mike.
- MIKE: No problem, man.

948
00:47:02,147 --> 00:47:04,514
They're talking about
not even doing a biopsy,

949
00:47:04,781 --> 00:47:07,349
just go in and get it...
malignant or not.

950
00:47:08,815 --> 00:47:09,748
MIKE: You, um...

951
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,881
You want me
to call Apex for you?

952
00:47:12,081 --> 00:47:13,180
Nah, I already did.

953
00:47:13,515 --> 00:47:16,049
Told them I'm out
for the season, maybe longer.

954
00:47:17,948 --> 00:47:19,381
I have to be here.

955
00:47:21,016 --> 00:47:23,712
Okay, Enzo, you're gonna bunk
with Uncle Mike tonight.

956
00:47:23,714 --> 00:47:24,879
What do you say about that?

957
00:47:24,881 --> 00:47:26,416
You be good for Mike, okay?

958
00:47:27,417 --> 00:47:29,016
See you in a couple days.

959
00:47:31,016 --> 00:47:33,517
ENZO: <i>I would have done
anything to stay with him.</i>

960
00:47:34,548 --> 00:47:35,514
<i>But being a dog,</i>

961
00:47:35,516 --> 00:47:37,481
<i>I was not allowed
into the hospital</i>

962
00:47:37,483 --> 00:47:40,917
<i>to hear the diagnosis
or the options being discussed.</i>

963
00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:43,484
<i>I was almost ten years old</i>

964
00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:46,082
<i>but no one confided in me,</i>

965
00:47:46,084 --> 00:47:49,113
<i>or expected anything except
that I control my barking</i>

966
00:47:49,115 --> 00:47:51,349
<i>and do my business outside.</i>

967
00:47:51,351 --> 00:47:52,418
(indistinct chatter)

968
00:47:52,618 --> 00:47:54,918
<i>Somewhere the zebra was dancing.</i>

969
00:47:56,884 --> 00:47:58,484
<i>I thought about escaping.</i>

970
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:00,849
<i>I wanted to push everyone away</i>

971
00:48:00,851 --> 00:48:02,449
<i>and run off to live
with my ancestors</i>

972
00:48:02,451 --> 00:48:04,886
<i>on the high desert plains
of Mongolia.</i>

973
00:48:09,451 --> 00:48:12,317
<i>I might have, too,
if not for my absolute faith</i>

974
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:14,816
<i>in Denny's ability
to make things right again.</i>

975
00:48:14,818 --> 00:48:16,352
(indistinct chatter)

976
00:48:22,653 --> 00:48:23,987
She's out of surgery.

977
00:48:24,385 --> 00:48:25,685
Now we just wait and...

978
00:48:25,918 --> 00:48:27,485
see how she responds.

979
00:48:29,887 --> 00:48:31,018
Hey, pal.

980
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:33,085
ENZO: <i>A transmission gear snaps</i>

981
00:48:33,087 --> 00:48:34,684
<i>The clutch fails.</i>

982
00:48:34,686 --> 00:48:36,887
<i>Brakes go soft from overheating.</i>

983
00:48:38,553 --> 00:48:40,419
<i>The poor driver will crash.</i>

984
00:48:40,754 --> 00:48:42,654
<i>The average driver will quit.</i>

985
00:48:42,955 --> 00:48:45,420
<i>But the great driver
will drive through the problem.</i>

986
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:46,388
Hey, listen.

987
00:48:47,587 --> 00:48:49,519
I have to teach tomorrow,

988
00:48:49,521 --> 00:48:51,552
so you're gonna go to
Caroline's house after school

989
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:53,121
and I'll pick you up at six.

990
00:48:54,353 --> 00:48:55,254
Okay.

991
00:48:55,655 --> 00:48:56,554
Okay.

992
00:48:58,588 --> 00:48:59,855
Daddy?

993
00:49:00,487 --> 00:49:01,488
Yeah.

994
00:49:03,754 --> 00:49:05,555
When's Mommy gonna come home?

995
00:49:07,954 --> 00:49:09,323
I don't know, pal.

996
00:49:10,755 --> 00:49:12,022
Soon, I hope.

997
00:49:12,389 --> 00:49:15,389
ENZO: <i>The great driver finds
a way to keep racing.</i>

998
00:49:16,022 --> 00:49:17,322
Good night, Daddy.

999
00:49:17,755 --> 00:49:19,424
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

1000
00:49:23,889 --> 00:49:25,056

(indistinct chatter)

1002
00:49:35,024 --> 00:49:37,088
Oh, what's the matter?
You like grilled cheese.

1003
00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:39,088
But it's gonna be cold
by lunchtime.

1004
00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:40,489
Give your dad a break.

1005
00:49:40,491 --> 00:49:43,122
DENNY: I'm kinda learning
on the job here, kiddo.

1006
00:49:43,124 --> 00:49:44,558
Your wife works too, huh?

1007
00:49:44,891 --> 00:49:47,425
My mommy's in the hospital.
Her brain got sick.

1008
00:49:48,623 --> 00:49:50,957
DENNY: Okay, so I'm gonna
pick you up right after school.

1009
00:49:51,192 --> 00:49:53,559
But today's Tuesday.
I have an extended day.

1010
00:49:53,757 --> 00:49:55,055
Okay, so what time is that over?

1011
00:49:55,057 --> 00:49:56,992
Ask Mommy. She knows.

1012
00:49:58,224 --> 00:49:59,926
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Bye.

1013
00:50:01,424 --> 00:50:02,557
ZOË: Hi, Mommy.

1014
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:03,723
ENZO: <i>Days became weeks,</i>

1015
00:50:03,725 --> 00:50:06,957
<i>and still Eve did not come
home from the hospital.</i>

1016
00:50:06,959 --> 00:50:08,427
You're gonna be okay.

1017
00:50:09,191 --> 00:50:11,426
ZOË: Everything's gonna be okay.

1018
00:50:12,959 --> 00:50:14,993
Maybe you should sit down now.

1019
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:27,491
ENZO: <i>The people who cared
about Denny</i>

1020
00:50:27,493 --> 00:50:28,993
<i>made special accommodations.</i>

1021
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,925
<i>Mike got him some part-time
work at the garage</i>

1022
00:50:31,927 --> 00:50:34,560
<i>and looked after me
whenever Denny asked.</i>

1023
00:50:35,593 --> 00:50:36,491
Ow!

1024
00:50:36,493 --> 00:50:37,624
ENZO: <i>And there were
other skills</i>

1025
00:50:37,626 --> 00:50:38,826
<i>he was forced to master.</i>

1026
00:50:38,828 --> 00:50:40,428
- ZOË: You're hurting me!
- DENNY: Okay.

1027
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:41,660
I'm sorry.

1028
00:50:41,894 --> 00:50:43,291
ENZO: <i>Zoë spent
the hot summer days</i>

1029

00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:48,293
Hi, sweetheart.

1031
00:50:48,594 --> 00:50:50,893
ENZO: <i>...and the occasional
night with the twins.</i>

TRISH: Bye!

1033
00:50:53,662 --> 00:50:54,963
Here we go.

1034
00:50:57,895 --> 00:50:58,894
ENZO: <i>On those nights,</i>

1035
00:50:59,162 --> 00:51:01,562
<i>Denny would stay late

1036
00:51:03,163 --> 00:51:06,097
<i>When we'd come home,

00:51:17,063 --> 00:51:20,363
ENZO: <i>And then it would fall

(exhales)

1040
00:51:42,731 --> 00:51:44,697
ENZO: <i>By autumn,
we'd come to resemble</i>

<i>something like
a seasoned pit crew.</i>

1042
00:51:47,832 --> 00:51:50,897
<i>Anticipating, adjusting,
correcting.</i>

1043
00:51:51,164 --> 00:51:53,430
Wait, sweetheart, here.
Here's your lunch.

1044
00:51:53,432 --> 00:51:55,362
- Thanks, Daddy.
- Okay, see you later.

1045
00:51:55,364 --> 00:51:56,298
- Bye.
- Bye.

1046
00:51:56,532 --> 00:51:57,866
Bye, Enzo.

1047
00:51:58,332 --> 00:51:59,333
Bye.

1048
00:52:01,533 --> 00:52:02,866
What do you say, Enz?

1049
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:04,534
You're gonna like this one.
You ready?

1050
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,199
Hey, Zoë!

1051
00:52:07,766 --> 00:52:08,968
Dinner!

1052
00:52:10,233 --> 00:52:12,197
ANNOUNCER: (on TV) <i>Benjamin
is going around the outside,</i>

1053
00:52:12,199 --> 00:52:14,765
- <i>and it's Wilson and Neal.</i>
- (chuckles) Oh!

1054
00:52:14,767 --> 00:52:16,730
No fair.
It's the red car's fault!

1055
00:52:16,732 --> 00:52:17,833
DENNY: Well, yes and no.

1056
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:20,399
See, you've got to be in charge
of your position on the track.

1057
00:52:20,401 --> 00:52:22,134
That's what
the red car was doing.

1058
00:52:25,467 --> 00:52:27,634
At some point, in every race

1059
00:52:28,201 --> 00:52:30,768
you got to take a risk
if you want to win.

1060
00:52:31,268 --> 00:52:33,266
(in sing-song)
"Slow hands in the fast stuff,

1061
00:52:33,268 --> 00:52:35,534
fast hands in the slow stuff."

1062
00:52:35,734 --> 00:52:37,166
(chuckles) Oh, my God!

1063
00:52:37,168 --> 00:52:39,001
Your mom is gonna kill me.

1064
00:52:39,302 --> 00:52:41,435
ENZO: <i>That night,
Denny got the call.</i>

1065
00:52:42,003 --> 00:52:44,869
<i>The doctors were finally
allowing Eve to come home,</i>

1066
00:52:45,135 --> 00:52:47,701
<i>only she wouldn't be coming home
to us.</i>

1067
00:52:48,136 --> 00:52:50,132
Why can't Mommy stay with us?

1068
00:52:50,134 --> 00:52:51,501
DENNY: Well, she will soon.

1069
00:52:51,503 --> 00:52:53,133
But we thought since
your grandparents

1070
00:52:53,135 --> 00:52:54,266
are home all the time,

1071
00:52:54,268 --> 00:52:56,201
it'd be best if she just stayed
with them.

1072
00:52:56,436 --> 00:52:57,437
Just for now.

1073
00:53:06,636 --> 00:53:08,103
Mommy's here!

1074
00:53:11,903 --> 00:53:13,237
(chuckling)

1075
00:53:15,804 --> 00:53:18,005
- Oh, Zoë...
- EVE: That's fine, Mom.

1076
00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:19,770
EVE: Oh, my baby.

1077
00:53:20,104 --> 00:53:21,568
I've been waiting for this.

1078
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:22,735
Me, too.

1079
00:53:22,737 --> 00:53:24,037
(Enzo whines)

1080
00:53:26,339 --> 00:53:27,606
It's still her, boy.

1081
00:53:32,538 --> 00:53:33,539
(chuckles)

1082
00:53:34,205 --> 00:53:35,206
EVE: Mmm.

1083
00:53:37,371 --> 00:53:39,070
ZOË: "And it was snowing
on a squirrel,

1084
00:53:39,072 --> 00:53:41,204
it was snowing on a beaver

1085
00:53:41,206 --> 00:53:43,305
and it was snowing on everyone.

1086
00:53:43,871 --> 00:53:45,169
But then he said,

1087
00:53:45,171 --> 00:53:47,738
'Oh, look, just as we thought.'

1088
00:53:47,939 --> 00:53:50,539
And Boggan said, 'Whishhhh.'

1089
00:53:50,872 --> 00:53:53,739
Charles wrote his wish
on a piece of paper."

1090
00:53:54,007 --> 00:53:56,405
DENNY: I don't understand.
What exactly are you asking?

1091
00:53:56,407 --> 00:53:58,904
Maxwell and I think Zoë
should stay here with us.

1092
00:53:58,906 --> 00:54:00,206
At least until...

1093
00:54:01,806 --> 00:54:02,874
Until what?

1094
00:54:03,139 --> 00:54:05,538
Are we just assuming now
that she's not gonna make it?

1095
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:07,105
MAXWELL: We're all praying
for the best,

1096
00:54:07,107 --> 00:54:08,873
but you heard
what her doctor said.

1097
00:54:09,474 --> 00:54:11,807
This might be the only time
Zoë has with her mother.

1098
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,974
TRISH: I can drive her to
and from school.

1099
00:54:14,307 --> 00:54:15,241
Or you can.

1100
00:54:15,608 --> 00:54:17,141
TRISH: Whatever you want.

1101
00:54:17,909 --> 00:54:19,673
And you're welcome
to stay here, too.

1102
00:54:19,675 --> 00:54:21,342
We just didn't think that you...

1103
00:54:22,475 --> 00:54:23,941
It's really up to you.

1104
00:54:26,541 --> 00:54:27,976
I'll talk about it with Eve.

1105
00:54:31,476 --> 00:54:32,476
DENNY: Come on.

1106
00:54:34,810 --> 00:54:36,943
They just want to help us,
Denny.

1107
00:54:37,676 --> 00:54:38,943
I know.

1108
00:54:39,808 --> 00:54:41,542
What matters is what you want.

1109
00:54:45,443 --> 00:54:47,176
I want my old life back.

1110
00:54:51,977 --> 00:54:53,674
Has my dad been any better
with you?

1111
00:54:53,676 --> 00:54:54,874
He promised he would be.

1112
00:54:54,876 --> 00:54:57,443
Yeah, he's fine.
We're fine, really. You just...

1113
00:54:58,077 --> 00:55:00,944
You just keep focused on you.
Okay?

1114
00:55:02,345 --> 00:55:05,909
Knock wood, in a few weeks
I'll get some strength back

1115
00:55:05,911 --> 00:55:07,645
and we can both come home again.

1116
00:55:08,678 --> 00:55:09,879
Right?

1117
00:55:10,276 --> 00:55:11,277
Right.

1118
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:16,878
I want you
to start racing again.

1119
00:55:17,810 --> 00:55:20,011
You've been away
from it for too long.

1120
00:55:20,812 --> 00:55:22,012
We'll see.

1121
00:55:24,244 --> 00:55:26,445
I can't be the reason
that you quit.

1122
00:55:28,211 --> 00:55:30,511
You promised me
that you wouldn't quit.

1123
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,480
DENNY: I won't.

1124
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:36,946
I won't.

1125
00:55:41,078 --> 00:55:42,546
Get some sleep...

1126
00:55:43,612 --> 00:55:44,613
okay?

1127
00:55:47,746 --> 00:55:49,013
I love you.

1128
00:55:50,614 --> 00:55:52,481
I love you so much.

1129
00:56:01,147 --> 00:56:04,148
ENZO: <i>It must be so difficult
being a person.</i>

1130
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:08,312
<i>Sometimes I doubt my ability
to interact on such a level,</i>

1131
00:56:08,314 --> 00:56:11,046
<i>but I know it's required
if I'm to become the human</i>

1132
00:56:11,048 --> 00:56:12,282
<i>I hope to be.</i>

1133
00:56:16,115 --> 00:56:18,049
Take care of our girls, Enzo.

1134
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:26,246
ENZO: <i>I stayed awake
all that night</i>

1135
00:56:26,248 --> 00:56:28,116
<i>and many others that followed.</i>

1136
00:56:29,281 --> 00:56:31,083
<i>The demon was coming for Eve.</i>

1137
00:56:31,283 --> 00:56:33,650
<i>But he would have
to get through me first.</i>

1138
00:56:35,217 --> 00:56:36,981
<i>Only once the others awoke</i>

1139
00:56:36,983 --> 00:56:39,283
<i>did I dare relinquish
my guard duties.</i>

1140
00:56:39,782 --> 00:56:41,017
Lazy dog.

1141
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:46,917
ENZO: <i>On some nights,
Denny kept watch with me.</i>

1142
00:56:50,083 --> 00:56:52,515
<i>But he couldn't rest
in the morning.</i>

1143
00:56:52,517 --> 00:56:53,317
(grunting)

1144
00:56:53,751 --> 00:56:55,585
- I got it, I got it. Okay.
- <i>He had to stay strong for Zoë.</i>

1145
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:57,616
Tug-o-war. What about this one?

1146
00:56:57,618 --> 00:56:59,619
(both laughing)

1147
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:02,551
DENNY: We've got a tug-o-war.

1148
00:57:03,784 --> 00:57:06,151
DENNY: Which one's he gonna get?
Which one's he gonna get?

1149
00:57:06,484 --> 00:57:07,850
(Enzo barking)

1150
00:57:07,852 --> 00:57:10,085
(Denny grunting)

1151
00:57:10,851 --> 00:57:13,018
Here it goes! I got it.
It's over there!

1152
00:57:13,452 --> 00:57:14,453
Enz, come here.

1153
00:57:16,185 --> 00:57:17,385
Good boy.

1154
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:27,287
- TRISH: Remember?
- ZOË: Yeah.

1155
00:57:28,286 --> 00:57:30,554
ENZO: <i>His endurance
knew no limits.</i>

1156
00:57:31,819 --> 00:57:33,183
DENNY: Ah, hey...

1157
00:57:33,185 --> 00:57:34,420
- a tennis racket.
- TRISH: Yeah!

1158
00:57:34,621 --> 00:57:36,917
TRISH: And Grandpa got you
lessons at our club

1159
00:57:36,919 --> 00:57:39,153
on Wednesday afternoons.
Won't that be fun?

1160
00:57:39,354 --> 00:57:41,717
Actually, Wednesday's
not that good for me.

1161
00:57:41,719 --> 00:57:43,018
I'm at the garage all day.

1162
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:44,951
That's all right.
We can drive you, Zoë, right?

1163
00:57:44,953 --> 00:57:45,854
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

1164
00:57:46,387 --> 00:57:49,284
ENZO: <i>And when Eve's parents
doted on Zoë, he let them.</i>

1165
00:57:49,286 --> 00:57:52,218
<i>He understood this was their way
of pushing out of their minds</i>

1166
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:53,851
<i>what was happening
to their own daughter.</i>

1167
00:57:53,853 --> 00:57:56,054
(indistinct chattering)

1168
00:57:58,987 --> 00:58:01,422
ENZO: <i>A task that was,
of course, impossible.</i>

1169
00:58:14,954 --> 00:58:17,090
DENNY: Hey, I'm back.
Where are you guys?

1170
00:58:17,490 --> 00:58:18,788
(barking)

1171
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:21,256
(music playing on stereo)

1172
00:58:28,756 --> 00:58:30,823
- Hi.
- Surprise!

1173
00:58:31,089 --> 00:58:33,422
DENNY: (laughs)
What's the surprise?

1174
00:58:33,424 --> 00:58:34,255
Just come.

1175
00:58:34,257 --> 00:58:35,621
EVE: We decided to have a party.

1176
00:58:35,623 --> 00:58:36,989
We're having a party?

1177
00:58:37,324 --> 00:58:39,557
I think
I'm a little underdressed.

1178
00:58:39,824 --> 00:58:41,892
You look incredibly handsome.

1179
00:58:42,689 --> 00:58:44,291
Are you sure you're up for this?

1180
00:58:45,624 --> 00:58:47,158
I want to come home.

1181
00:58:48,492 --> 00:58:49,659
I want you home.

1182
00:58:50,824 --> 00:58:52,658
So bad, you have no idea.

1183
00:58:56,558 --> 00:58:58,558
(music continues playing)

1184
01:00:05,428 --> 01:00:06,630
Do you see?

1185
01:00:08,896 --> 01:00:10,163
EVE: Do you?

1186
01:00:12,228 --> 01:00:14,429
I'm not afraid of it anymore.

1187
01:00:17,229 --> 01:00:19,464
Because I know it's not the end.

1188
01:00:23,962 --> 01:00:25,963
But you knew that, didn't you?

1189
01:00:29,031 --> 01:00:30,465
You know everything.

1190
01:00:36,564 --> 01:00:38,231
ENZO: <i>Not everything, no.</i>

1191
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:41,631
(Eve exhales deeply)

1192
01:00:50,032 --> 01:00:51,532
ENZO: <i>But I know this:</i>

1193
01:00:55,166 --> 01:00:57,500
<i>Eve's last breath
freed her soul.</i>

1194
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:01,400
<i>I saw it leave, myself.</i>

1195
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:05,634
<i>Released to continue
its journey elsewhere.</i>

1196
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:09,301
(Denny sniffles)

1197
01:01:25,967 --> 01:01:27,368
(exhales)

1198
01:02:45,506 --> 01:02:46,506
DENNY: That's nice.

1199
01:03:53,844 --> 01:03:55,177
That's a baby game.

1200
01:03:55,609 --> 01:03:57,211
I have to be a grownup now.

1201
01:04:20,611 --> 01:04:22,345
(sighs deeply)

1202
01:04:24,377 --> 01:04:27,045
Trish just fixed Zoë something
to eat.

1203
01:04:28,645 --> 01:04:29,647
Thank you.

1204
01:04:34,046 --> 01:04:36,078
(sighs) All those people.

1205
01:05:14,365 --> 01:05:15,831
All her old friends.

1206
01:05:17,299 --> 01:05:18,565
Students of hers.

1207
01:05:18,765 --> 01:05:20,298
Yeah, everyone loved her.

1208
01:05:23,899 --> 01:05:25,329
I thought I'd be ready,
you know?

1209
01:05:25,331 --> 01:05:28,232
I mean,
I knew it was coming, but...

1210
01:05:28,832 --> 01:05:30,166
I wasn't ready.

1211
01:05:30,833 --> 01:05:32,000
Not at all.

1212
01:05:33,233 --> 01:05:35,167
Well, to be honest,
Denny, that's...

1213
01:05:36,165 --> 01:05:37,932
what's concerning us a little.

1214
01:05:38,232 --> 01:05:40,199
That you haven't made
any preparations.

1215
01:05:40,701 --> 01:05:42,434
You don't seem to have
a plan in place.

1216
01:05:42,634 --> 01:05:43,901
Plan? I don't...

1217
01:05:44,333 --> 01:05:47,300
Zoë's eating an egg
and some toast.

1218
01:05:47,567 --> 01:05:48,901
We just started.

1219
01:05:49,701 --> 01:05:51,001
Oh, I thought...

1220
01:05:52,601 --> 01:05:53,968
I'm sorry, started what?

1221
01:05:57,935 --> 01:06:01,235
Can one of you tell me
what exactly is going on here?

1222
01:06:04,433 --> 01:06:05,299
Um...

1223
01:06:05,301 --> 01:06:08,201
Maxwell
and I have been talking, and...

1224
01:06:09,368 --> 01:06:10,767
we were wondering if maybe

1225
01:06:10,769 --> 01:06:13,233
the best situation
for all of us involved

1226
01:06:13,235 --> 01:06:17,137
might be if Zoë continued
to live here with us.

1227
01:06:17,802 --> 01:06:19,901
(scoffs) What?

1228
01:06:20,102 --> 01:06:21,869
MAXWELL:
She needs stability right now.

1229
01:06:22,169 --> 01:06:24,200
And, frankly, we don't think
you're in a position

1230
01:06:24,202 --> 01:06:25,002
to provide that.

1231
01:06:25,302 --> 01:06:27,066
MAXWELL: Not if you're
gonna return to racing.

1232
01:06:27,068 --> 01:06:28,770
Are you gonna go back to racing?

1233
01:06:29,436 --> 01:06:30,769
Of course, yeah.

1234
01:06:31,035 --> 01:06:33,001
- Not right away, but...
- And when you do,

1235
01:06:33,003 --> 01:06:34,469
who's gonna take care
of Zoë then?

1236
01:06:35,336 --> 01:06:36,403
I will.

1237
01:06:37,170 --> 01:06:39,235
- Like you did Eve?
- Maxwell!

1238
01:06:39,237 --> 01:06:40,635
What the hell is that supposed
to mean?

1239
01:06:40,637 --> 01:06:41,902
Denny, please,
none of us has the heart

1240
01:06:41,904 --> 01:06:43,435
to argue about this right now.

1241
01:06:43,437 --> 01:06:44,835
Maybe if you'd been around more,

1242
01:06:44,837 --> 01:06:46,068
you'd have noticed
something was wrong.

1243
01:06:46,070 --> 01:06:47,502
Maybe it could've been caught
in time.

1244
01:06:47,504 --> 01:06:48,568
TRISH: That's not true!

1245
01:06:48,570 --> 01:06:49,902
He's upset, Denny,
he's just upset.

1246
01:06:49,904 --> 01:06:51,601
You don't think
that I asked the doctors

1247
01:06:51,603 --> 01:06:53,236
that question a thousand times?

1248
01:06:53,238 --> 01:06:55,869
We all know there's nothing
anybody could've done.

1249
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:57,303
That's not what this is about.

1250
01:06:57,305 --> 01:07:00,336
Zoë is coming home with me.
End of discussion!

1251
01:07:00,338 --> 01:07:02,637
We just want to consider
what's best for Zoë.

1252
01:07:02,639 --> 01:07:05,936
What's best for Zoë
is that she is with her father.

1253
01:07:05,938 --> 01:07:07,970
And if you want to have
any relationship with her,

1254
01:07:07,972 --> 01:07:10,436
I suggest you stop pushing
this issue right now!

1255
01:07:10,438 --> 01:07:11,570
See, what'd I tell you?

1256
01:07:11,572 --> 01:07:12,936
But you could still be
in her life,

1257
01:07:12,938 --> 01:07:14,836
just as much as you want to.

1258
01:07:14,838 --> 01:07:16,936
We have the time and the money
to care for her

1259
01:07:16,938 --> 01:07:18,272
the way Eve would have wanted.

1260
01:07:18,573 --> 01:07:21,472
You can continue to pursue
your racing full-time.

1261
01:07:21,673 --> 01:07:23,673
I'm done.
I'm done listening to this.

1262
01:07:24,039 --> 01:07:25,639
You're giving us
no other choice.

1263
01:07:26,106 --> 01:07:28,473
Maxwell,
you promised me you wouldn't!

1264
01:07:29,106 --> 01:07:30,140
(stammers)

1265
01:07:32,808 --> 01:07:34,206
DENNY: Are you kidding me?

1266
01:07:36,507 --> 01:07:37,571
I just buried my wife

1267
01:07:37,573 --> 01:07:40,704
and you're suing me
for custody of my daughter?!

1268
01:07:40,706 --> 01:07:42,139
(sobs) Denny, I'm so sorry.

1269
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:43,475
This is not at all
what we thought...

1270
01:07:43,674 --> 01:07:45,242
ZOË: Finished my egg.

1271
01:07:46,407 --> 01:07:48,072
Sweetheart, go inside
and pack your things.

1272
01:07:48,074 --> 01:07:49,506
We're gonna go home right now.

1273
01:07:49,508 --> 01:07:50,372
Everything's fine, honey.

1274
01:07:50,374 --> 01:07:51,940
Your dad has some things
to take care of,

1275
01:07:51,942 --> 01:07:53,139
so you'll stay with us for now.

1276
01:07:53,141 --> 01:07:55,275
Zoë, go and get your stuff.
We're leaving.

1277
01:07:56,542 --> 01:07:58,039
Who the hell
do you think you are?

1278
01:07:58,041 --> 01:07:59,974
MAXWELL: You can't do this alone
and you know it.

1279
01:07:59,976 --> 01:08:01,939
What happens when
you're back to disappearing

1280
01:08:01,941 --> 01:08:05,007
for days on end
at those races of yours?

1281
01:08:05,009 --> 01:08:06,906
You're on a plane every weekend.

1282
01:08:06,908 --> 01:08:09,572
You missed her birth,
for Christ sakes!

1283
01:08:09,574 --> 01:08:10,906
You're not taking her.

1284
01:08:10,908 --> 01:08:12,806
- (grunts)
- Oh, my God.

1285
01:08:12,808 --> 01:08:14,507
(groaning)

1286
01:08:14,509 --> 01:08:15,908
- Are you...
- I'm fine.

1287
01:08:15,910 --> 01:08:17,410
I said I'm fine!

1288
01:08:18,909 --> 01:08:20,507
Denny, please let her stay.

1289
01:08:20,509 --> 01:08:21,276
Just for now.

1290
01:08:21,510 --> 01:08:23,274
The lawyers could come up
with a compromise!

1291
01:08:23,276 --> 01:08:24,243
DENNY: Zoë!

1292
01:08:26,377 --> 01:08:28,307
We'll come back later
for your dolls, okay?

1293
01:08:28,309 --> 01:08:29,311
Okay.

1294
01:08:37,377 --> 01:08:38,779
Get in the car, sweetheart.

1295
01:08:40,777 --> 01:08:42,511
You're making a big mistake!

1296
01:08:43,844 --> 01:08:45,178
Enzo, get in.

1297
01:09:05,646 --> 01:09:07,112
Not now, Enzo.

1298
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:16,046
(scoffs)

1299
01:09:17,513 --> 01:09:19,314
What? Okay.

1300
01:09:23,347 --> 01:09:24,777
(chatter on TV)

1301
01:09:24,779 --> 01:09:26,012
ENZO: <i>I didn't know what was on.</i>

1302
01:09:26,014 --> 01:09:28,348
<i>I only knew he needed
a distraction.</i>

1303
01:09:30,047 --> 01:09:32,779
<i>It was something Eve used to do
when Denny was down.</i>

1304
01:09:32,781 --> 01:09:34,548
Okay, you crazy dog.

1305
01:09:36,714 --> 01:09:40,179
ENZO: <i>It turned out to be
the 1989 Luxembourg Grand Prix</i>

1306
01:09:40,181 --> 01:09:43,013
<i>in which the Irish driver
Kevin Finnerty York</i>

1307
01:09:43,015 --> 01:09:45,980
<i>finished victorious
while driving the final 20 laps</i>

1308
01:09:45,982 --> 01:09:47,816
<i>with only two gears.</i>

1309
01:09:51,949 --> 01:09:53,979
<i>A true champion
can accomplish things</i>

1310
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:56,482
<i>a normal person
would consider impossible.</i>

1311
01:09:58,115 --> 01:10:00,215
<i>Denny just needed
to remember that.</i>

1312
01:10:02,882 --> 01:10:05,013
DENNY: Thanks for taking
my call at home, Mark.

1313
01:10:05,015 --> 01:10:06,613
You're the only lawyer
that I know.

1314
01:10:06,615 --> 01:10:08,180
And you're the only mechanic
I trust.

1315
01:10:08,182 --> 01:10:09,384
(chuckles)

1316
01:10:09,683 --> 01:10:10,881
MARK: Relax, Denny.

1317
01:10:10,883 --> 01:10:12,047
From what you told me
on the phone,

1318
01:10:12,049 --> 01:10:14,080
this is open-and-shut.

1319
01:10:14,082 --> 01:10:16,348
- Where is your daughter now?
- She wanted to go to school.

1320
01:10:16,350 --> 01:10:18,949
- Should I have kept her at home?
- No, that's good.

1321
01:10:18,951 --> 01:10:20,050
You're responding to her needs.

1322
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:23,049
They're trying to claim
you're an unfit parent

1323
01:10:23,051 --> 01:10:25,617
because of the intrinsic
dangers of your occupation.

1324
01:10:25,851 --> 01:10:27,684
MAXWELL:
It's a totally bogus suit.

1325
01:10:27,951 --> 01:10:30,282
Can't imagine why they
even bothered to file it.

1326
01:10:30,284 --> 01:10:33,015
I'll demand a summary judgment
and that'll be that.

1327
01:10:33,017 --> 01:10:34,615
You're saying
there's not even a chance.

1328
01:10:34,617 --> 01:10:35,983
This is Washington State.

1329
01:10:35,985 --> 01:10:38,417
The child is always awarded
to the biological parent.

1330
01:10:39,018 --> 01:10:41,185
- No question.
- (breathes deeply)

1331
01:10:48,085 --> 01:10:50,384
- Afternoon, Officers.
- You Dennis Swift?

1332
01:10:50,386 --> 01:10:52,286
I'll just check if he's still
in the back.

1333
01:10:57,820 --> 01:10:59,118
I'm Denny Swift.

1334
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:01,387
Would you step out
from behind the counter, sir?

1335
01:11:02,286 --> 01:11:03,353
Okay.

1336
01:11:03,687 --> 01:11:05,518
We have a warrant
for your arrest.

1337
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:06,986
DENNY: Some kind of joke?

1338
01:11:06,988 --> 01:11:09,187
Place your hands on the counter
and spread your legs.

1339
01:11:09,721 --> 01:11:11,017
- Okay.
- (Enzo barking)

1340
01:11:11,019 --> 01:11:12,218
Hey, buddy, it's okay.

1341
01:11:12,220 --> 01:11:13,917
DENNY: Can you tell me
how long this will take?

1342
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:15,317
You have the right
to remain silent...

1343
01:11:15,319 --> 01:11:17,586
I need to pick my daughter
up from school.

1344
01:11:17,588 --> 01:11:18,653
Denny,
I can pick her up for you.

1345
01:11:18,655 --> 01:11:19,754
No, call Mark Finn.

1346
01:11:19,988 --> 01:11:21,351
- He'll know what to do.
- Do you understand your rights?

1347
01:11:21,353 --> 01:11:22,853
- Yeah, I understand.
- This way, please.

1348
01:11:22,855 --> 01:11:24,152
Call Mark Finn.

1349
01:11:24,154 --> 01:11:25,151
Stay.

1350
01:11:25,153 --> 01:11:26,588
TONY: What are you
arresting him for?

1351
01:11:27,554 --> 01:11:30,854
ENZO: <i>I'd only felt
such helplessness once before.</i>

1352
01:11:31,188 --> 01:11:33,388
<i>The day Eve collapsed
in the woods.</i>

1353
01:11:37,855 --> 01:11:39,786
MARK: Coffee tomorrow morning,
8:30 sharp.

1354
01:11:39,788 --> 01:11:41,319
We'll go over everything then,
all right?

1355
01:11:41,321 --> 01:11:42,123
All right.

1356
01:11:43,822 --> 01:11:45,787
We tried picking Zoë up
from school, but...

1357
01:11:45,789 --> 01:11:47,990
I know, her grandparents got
to her first.

1358
01:11:48,622 --> 01:11:50,089
They timed this thing
on purpose, man.

1359
01:11:50,490 --> 01:11:51,557
Come on.

1360
01:11:52,489 --> 01:11:53,823
Thanks, Mike.

1361
01:11:55,557 --> 01:11:58,987
MARK: Fourth-degree assault
is a gross misdemeanor,

1362
01:11:58,989 --> 01:12:01,757
so it's unlikely
you'll see any real jail time.

1363
01:12:01,989 --> 01:12:04,524
But we both know
that's not what this is about.

1364
01:12:04,824 --> 01:12:07,022
There's almost no chance
you'll be awarded custody

1365
01:12:07,024 --> 01:12:08,623
- if you're convicted.
- (scoffs)

1366
01:12:09,156 --> 01:12:11,188
Now, because
of the criminal charges,

1367
01:12:11,190 --> 01:12:13,722
the judge granted
a temporary restraining order.

1368
01:12:13,724 --> 01:12:15,088
That means you're looking
at 90 days

1369
01:12:15,090 --> 01:12:16,225
before you can see Zoë again.

1370
01:12:16,557 --> 01:12:17,621
No.

1371
01:12:17,623 --> 01:12:19,055
DENNY: No, I can't not see...

1372
01:12:19,057 --> 01:12:20,288
MARK: You're gonna have to.

1373
01:12:20,290 --> 01:12:21,989
Eve's parents already filed
a motion

1374
01:12:21,991 --> 01:12:23,289
to terminate your rights.

1375
01:12:23,291 --> 01:12:25,759
Mark, this is crazy.
He grabbed me.

1376
01:12:25,957 --> 01:12:27,056
Any witnesses?

1377
01:12:27,058 --> 01:12:30,656
Trish, I guess,
but her back was to us.

1378
01:12:30,658 --> 01:12:31,891
DENNY: I can talk to her.

1379
01:12:31,893 --> 01:12:34,360
No, do not speak to either
of them, I mean it.

1380
01:12:34,625 --> 01:12:36,359
You'll jeopardize
your entire case.

1381
01:12:36,692 --> 01:12:39,623
Now, to explain your absence
to Zoë

1382
01:12:39,625 --> 01:12:41,356
we have agreed to invent a story

1383
01:12:41,358 --> 01:12:43,325
about you driving
for a team in Europe.

1384
01:12:43,893 --> 01:12:46,225
I also managed to negotiate
a letter exchange.

1385
01:12:46,826 --> 01:12:48,292
Ninety days!

1386
01:12:48,959 --> 01:12:51,093
ENZO: <i>The injustice
was unbearable.</i>

1387
01:12:51,491 --> 01:12:53,158
<i>First, Denny lost Eve,</i>

1388
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:55,827
<i>and now he would be deprived
of Zoë, too.</i>

1389
01:13:04,359 --> 01:13:06,827
<i>Denny struggled
as the weeks passed.</i>

1390
01:13:13,293 --> 01:13:14,494
(chuckles softly)

1391
01:13:15,495 --> 01:13:17,326
ENZO: <i>While I very much wish
to be human,</i>

1392
01:13:17,328 --> 01:13:20,428
<i>there is one advantage to being
a dog that I will miss.</i>

1393
01:13:22,627 --> 01:13:23,825
What do you think, Enz?

1394
01:13:23,827 --> 01:13:24,892
(barks)

1395
01:13:24,894 --> 01:13:26,262
ENZO: <i>It is this:</i>

1396
01:13:28,095 --> 01:13:31,795
<i>A dog can power down his psyche
and slow his metabolism.</i>

1397
01:13:32,562 --> 01:13:35,797
<i>He can sit for hours on end
with no effort.</i>

1398
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:39,026
<i>A dog can change
the tempo of the world,</i>

1399
01:13:39,028 --> 01:13:40,529
<i>but people are at its mercy.</i>

1400
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:47,962
(phone ringing)

1401
01:13:49,796 --> 01:13:50,994
Hello?

1402
01:13:50,996 --> 01:13:52,964
MARK: (on phone)
<i>What's the deal with the dog?</i>

1403
01:13:53,397 --> 01:13:54,296
- Huh?
- MARK: <i>The dog.</i>

1404
01:13:54,530 --> 01:13:56,998
<i>Zoë's been asking
her grandparents to see the dog.</i>

1405
01:13:57,697 --> 01:13:59,331
Of course, she can see Enzo.

1406
01:13:59,830 --> 01:14:01,161
Tell her he's been staying
at Mike's

1407
01:14:01,163 --> 01:14:03,829
and I can have Mike
drop Enzo off this weekend.

1408
01:14:03,831 --> 01:14:05,763
- MARK: <i>Okay. I'll float it.</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

1409
01:14:05,765 --> 01:14:06,765
Thanks, Mark.

1410
01:14:07,197 --> 01:14:10,165
MARK: <i>Listen, my secretary says
we sent you an invoice.</i>

1411
01:14:10,965 --> 01:14:12,762
Yeah, I paid that.

1412
01:14:12,764 --> 01:14:14,063
MARK: <i>That was
your prior invoice.</i>

1413
01:14:14,065 --> 01:14:15,595
<i>I realize you can't leave
the state,</i>

1414
01:14:15,597 --> 01:14:17,163
<i>so racing is not an option.</i>

1415
01:14:17,165 --> 01:14:18,863
<i>But I have people working
on this...</i>

1416
01:14:18,865 --> 01:14:19,961
<i>paralegals, support staff.</i>

1417
01:14:19,963 --> 01:14:21,532
Yeah, I know, Mark. I'll...

1418
01:14:21,998 --> 01:14:23,833
find a way to pay you.

1419
01:14:26,832 --> 01:14:28,032
(sniffles)

1420
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:33,698
ENZO: <i>It was hard to comprehend</i>

1421
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:35,567
<i>this turn our lives had taken.</i>

1422
01:14:43,466 --> 01:14:44,567
(Zoë giggles)

1423
01:14:45,834 --> 01:14:47,134
Come here, Enz!

1424
01:14:50,434 --> 01:14:53,764
Make sure you wipe his paws off
before he comes in.

1425
01:14:53,766 --> 01:14:55,498
Grandma just had
the carpets cleaned.

1426
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:57,400
Okay. (giggling)

1427
01:14:58,267 --> 01:15:01,500
(singing) <i>Hey, little Enzo
So nice to see you...</i>

1428
01:15:03,568 --> 01:15:05,469
I miss Daddy. Don't you?

1429
01:15:07,168 --> 01:15:08,833
ENZO: <i>For the first time
in my life,</i>

1430
01:15:08,835 --> 01:15:10,501
<i>I was glad I couldn't talk.</i>

1431
01:15:11,735 --> 01:15:13,835
<i>I wouldn't know
what to tell her.</i>

1432
01:15:17,369 --> 01:15:18,635
(chuckling)

1433
01:15:18,835 --> 01:15:20,234
ENZO: <i>After Zoë went to sleep,</i>

1434
01:15:20,236 --> 01:15:23,534
<i>I took the opportunity
to spy on the twins.</i>

1435
01:15:23,536 --> 01:15:25,136
The man put me on the ground.

1436
01:15:25,503 --> 01:15:28,037
I cracked a rib, for God's sake.

1437
01:15:28,536 --> 01:15:29,970
You saw what happened!

1438
01:15:31,169 --> 01:15:33,633
The lawyer said
the whole case hinges

1439
01:15:33,635 --> 01:15:35,404
on you corroborating
my statement.

1440
01:15:36,337 --> 01:15:37,736
You need to testify.

1441
01:15:38,403 --> 01:15:40,970
ENZO: <i>Inside me
a darkness was brewing.</i>

1442
01:15:41,170 --> 01:15:43,168
Just remember
who we're doing this for, okay?

1443
01:15:43,170 --> 01:15:45,471
Our granddaughter.
That's all that matters.

1444
01:15:47,704 --> 01:15:50,735
ENZO: <i>And I was not above
using the tools of my dogness</i>

1445
01:15:50,737 --> 01:15:52,305
<i>to exact justice.</i>

1446
01:15:53,037 --> 01:15:54,038
What?

1447
01:15:55,805 --> 01:15:57,071
You like pepper?

1448
01:15:57,371 --> 01:15:58,839
Maxwell.

1449
01:15:59,838 --> 01:16:01,601
ENZO: <i>I knew that pepper
was bad for me,</i>

1450
01:16:01,603 --> 01:16:02,871
<i>but I ate it anyway.</i>

1451
01:16:05,772 --> 01:16:06,804
Good, huh?

1452
01:16:07,371 --> 01:16:10,139
ENZO: <i>After all,
I'm just a stupid dog.</i>

1453
01:16:10,706 --> 01:16:13,837
<i>It's the second longest
bull market we've ever seen.</i>

1454
01:16:13,839 --> 01:16:15,773
<i>Potential sellers
have not bailed out.</i>

1455
01:16:16,006 --> 01:16:17,737
ENZO: <i>I watched and I waited...</i>

1456
01:16:17,739 --> 01:16:19,970
(Enzo's stomach growling)

1457
01:16:19,972 --> 01:16:23,639
<i>...as in my stomach
a foul concoction steeped.</i>

1458
01:16:23,873 --> 01:16:26,073
(Enzo farting)

1459
01:16:26,739 --> 01:16:28,541
(sniffing)

1460
01:16:33,306 --> 01:16:36,140
MAXWELL: Come on.
We got to go outside, come on.

1461
01:16:38,607 --> 01:16:40,805
(stomach growling)

1462
01:16:40,807 --> 01:16:42,542
Come on. Let's go,
let's get busy, come on!

1463
01:16:43,574 --> 01:16:45,573
Come on, let's go,
let's get busy.

1464
01:16:45,575 --> 01:16:47,572
Oh, no, no. No!

1465
01:16:47,574 --> 01:16:49,239
- No, no, no, no!
- (defecating)

1466
01:16:49,241 --> 01:16:51,508
MAXWELL: Trish! Get down here!

1467
01:16:51,874 --> 01:16:54,442
The dog just took a liquid dump
on the carpet!

1468
01:16:54,706 --> 01:16:56,307
MAXWELL: Where's the bucket?

1469
01:16:56,574 --> 01:16:57,973
Ohhh, God.

1470
01:16:57,975 --> 01:17:00,676
MAXWELL: Trish!
Can you get down here?

1471
01:17:01,042 --> 01:17:02,708
ENZO: <i>You get busy, mister.</i>

1472
01:17:03,675 --> 01:17:06,706
Your eyes are already forward,
looking at that next turn.

1473
01:17:06,708 --> 01:17:08,441
- Mmm-hmm.
- Give me a second, okay?

1474
01:17:09,210 --> 01:17:09,909
What happened?

1475
01:17:10,209 --> 01:17:11,374
I thought they were keeping him
until tonight.

1476
01:17:11,376 --> 01:17:13,240
MIKE: Yeah.
From what I understand,

1477
01:17:13,242 --> 01:17:15,407
Enzo wasn't exactly
the ideal houseguest.

1478
01:17:15,409 --> 01:17:17,209
Okay. Well,
we're almost finished up here.

1479
01:17:18,109 --> 01:17:19,940
ENZO: <i>It'd been years
since these old eyes</i>

1480
01:17:19,942 --> 01:17:21,241
<i>had seen a live track.</i>

1481
01:17:21,243 --> 01:17:24,110
<i>I didn't realize
just how much I'd missed it.</i>

1482
01:17:24,775 --> 01:17:26,941
<i>I even felt the tug
of my old dream</i>

1483
01:17:26,943 --> 01:17:29,242
<i>of driving in a real racecar
alongside him.</i>

1484
01:17:29,244 --> 01:17:30,775
KITCH: All right,
let's checker the session,

1485
01:17:30,777 --> 01:17:31,841
clear the track!

1486
01:17:31,843 --> 01:17:33,507
All the students
to the grandstand.

1487
01:17:33,509 --> 01:17:34,775
Nobody head home yet.

1488
01:17:34,777 --> 01:17:36,575
Hey, Denny, got a minute?

1489
01:17:36,577 --> 01:17:37,545
DENNY: Give me a second.

1490
01:17:38,643 --> 01:17:39,644
Luca!

1491
01:17:39,843 --> 01:17:41,542
Don, how are you?
Good to see you.

1492
01:17:41,544 --> 01:17:42,675
KITCH: Good to see you.

1493
01:17:42,677 --> 01:17:44,443
This is Luca Pantoni
from Ferrari.

1494
01:17:44,445 --> 01:17:45,808
He's visiting us from Italy.

1495
01:17:45,810 --> 01:17:47,774
- Denny Swift.
- PANTONI: Pleasure.

1496
01:17:47,776 --> 01:17:48,875
Is this the new model?

1497
01:17:48,877 --> 01:17:50,175
Yeah, direct from the factory.

1498
01:17:50,177 --> 01:17:51,777
It's even better-looking
in person.

1499
01:17:51,978 --> 01:17:54,512
You know,
I saw you race once. In Daytona.

1500
01:17:54,778 --> 01:17:56,443
Yeah, that was a tough one.

1501
01:17:56,445 --> 01:17:58,445
Luca was hoping
you could show him the track.

1502
01:17:59,778 --> 01:18:00,909
Yes, sir.

1503
01:18:00,911 --> 01:18:02,943
(engine revving)

1504
01:18:02,945 --> 01:18:04,710
(people whooping, cheering)

1505
01:18:04,712 --> 01:18:05,976
MIKE: Who is that?

1506
01:18:05,978 --> 01:18:09,145
Head of driver development
from Ferrari in Italy.

1507
01:18:11,513 --> 01:18:13,647
MAN: Whoo-hoo!

1508
01:18:13,846 --> 01:18:15,743
I figure it'll take him a lap
to get comfortable

1509
01:18:15,745 --> 01:18:17,611
but next time by
it'll be a flyer.

1510
01:18:17,979 --> 01:18:19,214
- (chuckles)
- Follow me.

1511
01:18:19,514 --> 01:18:22,280
- MIKE: Come on, Enz.
- Up here, guys. Bring it in.

1512
01:18:23,113 --> 01:18:25,413
Now watch. You're getting
a master class here.

1513
01:18:27,614 --> 01:18:29,381
(tires screeching)

1514
01:18:31,980 --> 01:18:34,046
That said, any of you
ever drive like that,

1515
01:18:34,048 --> 01:18:36,446
I will black flag you
so fast your head'll spin.

1516
01:18:36,448 --> 01:18:37,580
Denny's a professional.

1517
01:18:37,582 --> 01:18:40,014
(tires squealing)

1518
01:18:58,281 --> 01:18:59,283
MAN: Whoo!

1519
01:19:03,848 --> 01:19:05,449
- How was it?
- (chuckles softly)

1520
01:19:06,115 --> 01:19:07,649
- That was incredible.
- Ha!

1521
01:19:07,848 --> 01:19:09,147
You deserve it.

1522
01:19:09,149 --> 01:19:11,248
- All right, show's over!
- What'd you think, huh, boy?

1523
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:12,815
KITCH: See everybody tomorrow!

1524
01:19:12,817 --> 01:19:14,918
You're a Ferrari guy.
Isn't she a beaut?

1525
01:19:16,016 --> 01:19:17,916
I would like to offer you a job.

1526
01:19:18,350 --> 01:19:19,484
I work in Maranello,

1527
01:19:19,717 --> 01:19:21,281
the factory headquarters,

1528
01:19:21,283 --> 01:19:23,418
and we have
a wonderful track there.

1529
01:19:24,016 --> 01:19:25,917
You'd be testing the cars.

1530
01:19:28,551 --> 01:19:30,984
Thank you, Mr. Pantoni, but...

1531
01:19:32,618 --> 01:19:34,149
there are certain things

1532
01:19:34,151 --> 01:19:37,050
that keep me from leaving
the country right now.

1533
01:19:37,052 --> 01:19:39,485
Don explained to me
all about your troubles.

1534
01:19:39,984 --> 01:19:42,384
But if your situation
should change,

1535
01:19:42,851 --> 01:19:44,386
my phone is on the card.

1536
01:19:45,986 --> 01:19:47,285
It was a pleasure.

1537
01:19:47,618 --> 01:19:48,886
DENNY: Thank you, sir.

1538
01:19:50,053 --> 01:19:51,053
Come on.

1539
01:19:52,819 --> 01:19:55,020
(engine revving)

1540
01:20:03,185 --> 01:20:05,019
He's asked
about you over the years.

1541
01:20:05,318 --> 01:20:07,051
When I told him what you
went through with Eve,

1542
01:20:07,053 --> 01:20:09,753
- he said he wanted to hire you.
- Huh.

1543
01:20:09,954 --> 01:20:11,984
All I know is, he respects
how you're fighting

1544
01:20:11,986 --> 01:20:13,121
for your daughter.

1545
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:18,621
And what if I don't win?

1546
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:20,853
KITCH: There's no dishonor
in losing the race,

1547
01:20:20,855 --> 01:20:22,552
there's only dishonor
in not racing

1548
01:20:22,554 --> 01:20:23,988
because you're afraid to lose.

1549
01:20:24,987 --> 01:20:26,852
Now go find your students,
get back on the track.

1550
01:20:26,854 --> 01:20:28,022
That's where you belong.

1551
01:20:30,355 --> 01:20:31,922
(clicks tongue) Come on.

1552
01:20:35,454 --> 01:20:38,454
ENZO: <i>Ninety days seemed
an eternity, even for me.</i>

1553
01:20:39,355 --> 01:20:42,190
<i>But at long last,
day 90 arrived.</i>

1554
01:20:47,288 --> 01:20:48,589
- Hey.
- Daddy!

1555
01:20:49,589 --> 01:20:50,556
DENNY: Oh!

1556
01:20:51,323 --> 01:20:52,356
Hi. (chuckles)

1557
01:20:52,790 --> 01:20:54,890
- Enzo!
- (Enzo barking)

1558
01:20:56,224 --> 01:20:57,654
MARK: I'll be back
for her by six.

1559
01:20:57,656 --> 01:20:58,987
DENNY: Okay.

1560
01:20:58,989 --> 01:21:00,457
- Take care.
- Thanks.

1561
01:21:01,189 --> 01:21:02,456
(chuckling)

1562
01:21:05,157 --> 01:21:07,454
- Mmm. Missed you.
- ZOË: Missed you.

1563
01:21:07,456 --> 01:21:11,023
Come on. I made something
special for dinner.

1564
01:21:11,389 --> 01:21:13,391
(utensils clattering)

1565
01:21:16,524 --> 01:21:17,592
Daddy?

1566
01:21:17,857 --> 01:21:19,792
Are you gonna go back
to Europe soon?

1567
01:21:20,257 --> 01:21:22,725
- No, not yet, sweetheart.
- Yay.

1568
01:21:23,257 --> 01:21:25,957
But, Zo, you need to stay
with your grandparents

1569
01:21:25,959 --> 01:21:27,723
for just a little while longer,
okay?

1570
01:21:27,725 --> 01:21:29,326
No, I want to come home.

1571
01:21:29,692 --> 01:21:30,625
I know you do.

1572
01:21:30,892 --> 01:21:32,923
And I want you to
more than anything, but...

1573
01:21:32,925 --> 01:21:34,324
the lawyers still need
to make a decision

1574
01:21:34,326 --> 01:21:36,159
about where it's best
for you to live.

1575
01:21:36,692 --> 01:21:38,156
Okay? That's just part
of what happens

1576
01:21:38,158 --> 01:21:39,658
when someone's mommy dies.

1577
01:21:39,858 --> 01:21:40,891
Just tell them.

1578
01:21:41,158 --> 01:21:43,026
Tell them I want to live
back home with you and Enzo.

1579
01:21:43,391 --> 01:21:44,526
DENNY: Okay.

1580
01:21:45,294 --> 01:21:46,393
I'll tell them.

1581
01:21:49,059 --> 01:21:50,860
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye, baby.

1582
01:21:52,194 --> 01:21:52,993
(Denny sighs)

1583
01:21:53,260 --> 01:21:55,360
You'll get her every other
weekend until the trial.

1584
01:21:55,660 --> 01:21:56,825
After that...

1585
01:21:56,827 --> 01:21:58,094
It's all or nothing.

1586
01:21:58,326 --> 01:21:59,827
(tapping on glass)

1587
01:22:00,726 --> 01:22:02,228
Look, Denny...

1588
01:22:02,594 --> 01:22:05,860
I know this isn't what you
want to hear right now...

1589
01:22:06,127 --> 01:22:07,792
but their attorney
made it clear to me.

1590
01:22:08,193 --> 01:22:11,459
The suit, the criminal charges,
it can all go away tomorrow,

1591
01:22:11,461 --> 01:22:13,562
if you dropped
your custody claim to Zoë.

1592
01:22:14,962 --> 01:22:17,093
Now, I have an obligation
to make sure you understand...

1593
01:22:17,095 --> 01:22:18,362
we have leverage now.

1594
01:22:18,727 --> 01:22:21,058
I'm talking visitation,
privileges.

1595
01:22:21,060 --> 01:22:23,094
Things we're gonna have
a much harder time securing,

1596
01:22:23,362 --> 01:22:25,294
if you're found guilty
of assault

1597
01:22:25,296 --> 01:22:27,563
and Zoë's grandparents
are awarded custody.

1598
01:22:30,261 --> 01:22:31,261
Leverage.

1599
01:22:31,461 --> 01:22:33,095
I'm not saying we can't win.

1600
01:22:33,529 --> 01:22:34,662
We might.

1601
01:22:35,128 --> 01:22:37,295
But we could also lose. Big.

1602
01:22:37,629 --> 01:22:38,893
Can't lose, Mark.

1603
01:22:38,895 --> 01:22:40,460
Denny, anyone can lose.

1604
01:22:40,462 --> 01:22:42,162
You, of all people,
should know that.

1605
01:22:44,197 --> 01:22:45,196
Look, just...

1606
01:22:45,595 --> 01:22:47,030
just give it some thought.

1607
01:22:50,763 --> 01:22:52,030
(car door closes)

1608
01:22:52,464 --> 01:22:53,997
(car engine starts)

1609
01:22:56,330 --> 01:22:58,297
ENZO: <i>I knew
what Denny was thinking.</i>

1610
01:22:58,930 --> 01:23:01,462
<i>If he just had
a steering wheel to hold onto,</i>

1611
01:23:01,464 --> 01:23:03,098
<i>his hands wouldn't shake.</i>

1612
01:23:10,998 --> 01:23:12,565
<i>"Just you and me, Enzo."</i>

1613
01:23:13,131 --> 01:23:15,797
<i>That's what he'd always say
when we'd take our night runs.</i>

1614
01:23:15,996 --> 01:23:17,728
Come on, Enz! Let's go.

1615
01:23:17,730 --> 01:23:19,264
ENZO: <i>But not that night.</i>

1616
01:23:20,032 --> 01:23:22,066
<i>We were together, but alone.</i>

1617
01:23:27,533 --> 01:23:29,566
<i>I began to devise a plan.</i>

1618
01:23:30,199 --> 01:23:32,129
<i>We'd drive
to Zoë's school one day,</i>

1619
01:23:32,131 --> 01:23:33,431
<i>pick her up unannounced</i>

1620
01:23:33,433 --> 01:23:35,296
<i>and then head straight
for Montreal,</i>

1621
01:23:35,298 --> 01:23:37,465
<i>where they host
a Grand Prix every summer.</i>

1622
01:23:43,067 --> 01:23:43,833
Enz?

1623
01:23:44,133 --> 01:23:45,930
Enzo, stay where you are!

1624
01:23:45,932 --> 01:23:47,032
Enzo, no!

1625
01:23:47,666 --> 01:23:49,099
- (Enzo whimpers)
- (Denny gasps)

1626
01:23:49,299 --> 01:23:50,400
Oh, God!

1627
01:23:53,267 --> 01:23:56,101
- I... I didn't see him!
- It's not your fault.

1628
01:23:57,467 --> 01:23:59,999
ENZO: <i>It was mine. Stupid.</i>

1629
01:24:00,001 --> 01:24:01,867
- Is he okay?
- DENNY: He's still breathing.

1630
01:24:02,134 --> 01:24:04,032
- Um...
- ENZO: <i>I'm so stupid.</i>

1631
01:24:04,034 --> 01:24:05,532
Let's get him in your car.

1632
01:24:05,534 --> 01:24:07,132
(panting)

1633
01:24:07,134 --> 01:24:09,033
ENZO: <i>Your car goes
where your eyes go.</i>

1634
01:24:09,035 --> 01:24:10,535
<i>How could I forget?</i>

1635
01:24:14,201 --> 01:24:16,968
<i>Ayrton Senna did not have
to die at Imola.</i>

1636
01:24:17,201 --> 01:24:20,202
<i>That's what I was thinking
on the way to the hospital.</i>

1637
01:24:20,902 --> 01:24:22,600
<i>He struck the concrete barrier</i>

1638
01:24:22,602 --> 01:24:26,002
<i>at the Tamburello corner
at 190 miles an hour.</i>

1639
01:24:26,269 --> 01:24:28,266
<i>But, by all accounts,
he would've survived</i>

1640
01:24:28,268 --> 01:24:30,366
<i>if not for a small piece
of suspension</i>

1641
01:24:30,368 --> 01:24:32,903
<i>that managed
to penetrate his helmet.</i>

1642
01:24:38,803 --> 01:24:40,204
Straight to the back.

1643
01:24:41,770 --> 01:24:43,404
ENZO: <i>But I know the truth.</i>

1644
01:24:44,403 --> 01:24:45,401
<i>Senna died that day</i>

1645
01:24:45,403 --> 01:24:47,669
<i>because his body
had served its purpose.</i>

1646
01:24:48,604 --> 01:24:51,237
<i>His soul had learned
what it came here to learn.</i>

1647
01:24:52,936 --> 01:24:54,936
<i>And I knew that
if I had already learned</i>

1648
01:24:54,938 --> 01:24:56,404
<i>what I was meant to...</i>

1649
01:24:56,670 --> 01:24:58,239
<i>I too would be gone.</i>

1650
01:24:59,403 --> 01:25:02,170
<i>But apparently,
I still had work to do.</i>

1651
01:25:02,172 --> 01:25:03,971
DOCTOR: Fair amount
of internal bleeding.

1652
01:25:04,471 --> 01:25:06,038
Also, some renal damage.

1653
01:25:06,338 --> 01:25:07,570
He is very lucky.

1654
01:25:07,572 --> 01:25:09,069
It could have been far worse.

1655
01:25:09,071 --> 01:25:11,338
I have to be honest
with you, Mr. Swift.

1656
01:25:11,538 --> 01:25:12,939
An old dog like yours,

1657
01:25:13,272 --> 01:25:16,339
this kind of injury's often
the beginning of the end.

1658
01:25:25,205 --> 01:25:27,170
X-rays, sedative, pain meds

1659
01:25:27,172 --> 01:25:30,737
and nighttime emergency fee
comes to $812.

1660
01:25:30,739 --> 01:25:31,940
Thank you.

1661
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:34,606
(machine beeps)

1662
01:25:34,873 --> 01:25:37,074
NURSE: I'm sorry,
your card was declined.

1663
01:25:37,541 --> 01:25:38,672
Oh.

1664
01:25:38,674 --> 01:25:41,141
Okay, um... here's my debit.

1665
01:25:41,841 --> 01:25:43,207
(machine beeps)

1666
01:25:43,540 --> 01:25:46,005
Uh, it says insufficient funds.

1667
01:25:46,007 --> 01:25:47,073
Is there a problem?

1668
01:25:47,406 --> 01:25:49,606
Uh, I deposited my paycheck
today, so it...

1669
01:25:49,608 --> 01:25:51,672
probably just needs to clear.

1670
01:25:51,674 --> 01:25:54,008
I do have some cash. I have...

1671
01:25:54,341 --> 01:25:55,372
$300.

1672
01:25:55,374 --> 01:25:57,206
I can go to the bank
first thing in the morning

1673
01:25:57,208 --> 01:25:58,939
and bring the rest by then.

1674
01:25:58,941 --> 01:26:00,606
It's fine. These things happen.

1675
01:26:00,608 --> 01:26:02,840
Write a receipt for the $300,
leave a note for Susan

1676
01:26:02,842 --> 01:26:04,406
to invoice
the balance in the morning.

1677
01:26:04,408 --> 01:26:05,208
Actually...

1678
01:26:05,474 --> 01:26:08,576
are you okay
if I keep just twenty of it?

1679
01:26:11,609 --> 01:26:12,610
Thank you.

1680
01:26:15,009 --> 01:26:17,509
DENNY: You ready to go home?
Huh, pal?

1681
01:26:23,075 --> 01:26:24,308
ENZO: <i>The medication kept me</i>

1682
01:26:24,310 --> 01:26:26,808
<i>in a near-constant dream state
for weeks</i>

1683
01:26:26,810 --> 01:26:29,342
<i>which I confess came
as a relief.</i>

1684
01:26:29,742 --> 01:26:31,610
(audience cheering faintly)

1685
01:26:33,644 --> 01:26:37,178
<i>Anything to replace that look
I'd seen on Denny's face.</i>

1686
01:26:38,609 --> 01:26:39,775
MARK: It's not for me to say

1687
01:26:39,777 --> 01:26:41,542
whether it's the right decision
or not.

1688
01:26:41,544 --> 01:26:42,278
But, for what it's worth,

1689
01:26:42,477 --> 01:26:44,644
I support you
on this a hundred percent.

1690
01:26:44,876 --> 01:26:46,141
Me, too.

1691
01:26:46,143 --> 01:26:47,776
You're doing
what you have to do.

1692
01:26:47,778 --> 01:26:49,476
Zoë will understand
when she's older.

1693
01:26:49,478 --> 01:26:52,076
The visitation schedule
will be as we discussed.

1694
01:26:52,078 --> 01:26:53,343
Plus, three weeks in the summer,

1695
01:26:53,345 --> 01:26:56,108
a week at Christmas,
and the April school break.

1696
01:26:56,110 --> 01:26:57,242
But what about the charges?

1697
01:26:57,244 --> 01:26:58,775
MARK: They'll be dropped
immediately.

1698
01:26:58,777 --> 01:27:00,545
Like I said, Denny,
we had leverage.

1699
01:27:01,311 --> 01:27:03,745
ENZO: <i>A sharp panic rose
in my throat.</i>

1700
01:27:04,078 --> 01:27:06,545
- I need a pen.
- ENZO: <i>Was I still dreaming?</i>

1701
01:27:07,211 --> 01:27:10,312
<i>Who was this person,
this imposter?</i>

1702
01:27:10,511 --> 01:27:11,811
<i>What had he done with Denny?</i>

1703
01:27:11,813 --> 01:27:14,246
Sorry. Only one I could find.

1704
01:27:15,746 --> 01:27:17,313
ENZO: <i>And then all was revealed.</i>

1705
01:27:17,813 --> 01:27:19,314
<i>Mmm, it wasn't Denny.</i>

1706
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:21,847
<i>It was the zebra.</i>

1707
01:27:22,246 --> 01:27:24,577
<i>I'd been in a position
to prevent the demon</i>

1708
01:27:24,579 --> 01:27:25,911
<i>from destroying Zoë's toys</i>

1709
01:27:25,913 --> 01:27:27,313
<i>and I'd failed.</i>

1710
01:27:27,847 --> 01:27:29,412
<i>I knew I had to stop it,</i>

1711
01:27:29,414 --> 01:27:30,548
<i>but how?</i>

1712
01:27:35,713 --> 01:27:38,081
Enzo! Give me those papers!

1713
01:27:38,481 --> 01:27:39,348
Come here!

1714
01:27:39,547 --> 01:27:42,214
- TONY: Where'd he go?
- MIKE: Out the window!

1715
01:27:42,481 --> 01:27:43,778
(Tony laughing)

1716
01:27:43,780 --> 01:27:46,081
DENNY: Enzo,
you give me those papers!

1717
01:27:46,947 --> 01:27:49,746
It's not funny, Tony.
Enzo, drop it! No!

1718
01:27:49,748 --> 01:27:51,214
(Mike laughing)

1719
01:27:51,747 --> 01:27:53,382
I mean, it's kind of funny.

1720
01:27:55,415 --> 01:27:57,779
Okay, you made your point.
you made your point.

1721
01:27:57,781 --> 01:27:59,849
(Mike and Tony laughing)

1722
01:28:08,649 --> 01:28:10,017
Call their lawyers.

1723
01:28:10,749 --> 01:28:12,350
Tell 'em we'll see 'em in court.

1724
01:28:13,016 --> 01:28:14,950
DENNY: I'm with Enzo
on this one.

1725
01:28:15,218 --> 01:28:16,081
You're sure?

1726
01:28:16,083 --> 01:28:17,484
I made Eve a promise.

1727
01:28:17,983 --> 01:28:19,283
I'm not quitting.

1728
01:28:19,883 --> 01:28:21,585
Man, I got to get me a dog.

1729
01:28:22,251 --> 01:28:23,585
(all chuckling)

1730
01:28:26,083 --> 01:28:28,148
(indistinct chatter)

1731
01:28:28,150 --> 01:28:30,117
ENZO: <i>Denny was prepared
to risk everything.</i>

1732
01:28:30,484 --> 01:28:32,984
<i>Lose the case
and he would lose Zoë.</i>

1733
01:28:34,352 --> 01:28:37,351
<i>His breathing that morning
struck me as unusual.</i>

1734
01:28:38,285 --> 01:28:39,283
(exhales sharply)

1735
01:28:39,285 --> 01:28:42,052
ENZO: <i>Deep inhalations,
quick exhalations.</i>

1736
01:28:43,051 --> 01:28:44,884
<i>It was a sound I recognized.</i>

1737
01:28:45,418 --> 01:28:48,220
<i>It was the way he breathed
just before a race.</i>

1738
01:29:03,852 --> 01:29:05,421
This is it, Enz.

1739
01:29:11,819 --> 01:29:13,353
(doorbell ringing)

1740
01:29:14,620 --> 01:29:15,587
It's Tony.

1741
01:29:20,221 --> 01:29:22,019
Hey, man. Thanks for coming by.

1742
01:29:22,021 --> 01:29:23,318
I would've brought him
by the shop,

1743
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:25,851
but he hasn't been doing
too good lately.

1744
01:29:25,853 --> 01:29:27,019
TONY: Yeah, poor little guy.

1745
01:29:27,021 --> 01:29:28,652
DENNY: Hey, Enz,
look who's here. It's Tony!

1746
01:29:28,654 --> 01:29:30,754
Hey, Enz, buddy.
How you doing, hmm?

1747
01:29:31,153 --> 01:29:33,355
- Good luck, Den.
- Thanks, man. Yeah.

1748
01:29:37,954 --> 01:29:40,288
- You want to watch TV?
- (barks softly)

1749
01:29:41,289 --> 01:29:43,186
ENZO: <i>Dogs are not allowed
in court,</i>

1750
01:29:43,188 --> 01:29:46,422
<i>so I was forced to imagine
what was happening across town.</i>

1751
01:29:47,022 --> 01:29:49,053
<i>I invented whole scenes
in my head</i>

1752
01:29:49,055 --> 01:29:52,022
<i>fueled by Denny's nightly
retelling of the day's events</i>

1753
01:29:52,489 --> 01:29:55,557
<i>as well as my own admittedly
melodramatic sensibility.</i>

1754
01:29:55,755 --> 01:29:57,087
<i>Objection, Your Honor!</i>

1755
01:29:57,089 --> 01:29:58,687
ENZO: <i>Perhaps it was
my advanced age</i>

1756
01:29:58,689 --> 01:30:02,423
<i>but I found my imagination
increasingly prone to wandering.</i>

1757
01:30:02,690 --> 01:30:04,887
<i>No, sir,
I most definitely did not.</i>

1758
01:30:04,889 --> 01:30:05,988
ENZO: <i>Until...</i>

1759
01:30:05,990 --> 01:30:06,990
(phone ringing)

1760
01:30:07,225 --> 01:30:09,222
MAN 1: (on TV) <i>Isn't it
possible at some point</i>

1761
01:30:09,224 --> 01:30:11,655
- <i>you decided to speed up?</i>
- (barking)

1762
01:30:11,657 --> 01:30:14,288
MAN 2: <i>Your Honor, I object.
Asked and answered.</i>

1763
01:30:14,290 --> 01:30:15,290
MAN 1: <i>How?!</i>

1764
01:30:16,257 --> 01:30:17,257
(sighs)

1765
01:30:17,657 --> 01:30:18,658
Yeah. (clears throat)

1766
01:30:18,957 --> 01:30:20,023
MAN 1: (on TV) <i>You don't even
remember killing...</i>

1767
01:30:20,025 --> 01:30:21,291
Um, I'm on my way.

1768
01:30:22,623 --> 01:30:23,922
TONY: Something's happened, bud.

1769
01:30:23,924 --> 01:30:25,525
- You want to come?
- (barks)

1770
01:30:26,824 --> 01:30:28,058
What's going on, Den?

1771
01:30:29,157 --> 01:30:31,089
ENZO: <i>With some effort,
I was able to decipher</i>

1772
01:30:31,091 --> 01:30:32,522
<i>what had happened.</i>

1773
01:30:32,524 --> 01:30:33,624
So help me God.

1774
01:30:33,925 --> 01:30:36,358
ENZO: <i>Today was the day
Trish had testified.</i>

1775
01:30:37,025 --> 01:30:39,792
Can you please tell the court
about the alleged assault?

1776
01:30:40,059 --> 01:30:42,124
TRISH: It happened the way
my husband said it did.

1777
01:30:42,126 --> 01:30:44,692
PROSECUTOR: So, you personally
witnessed Dennis Swift

1778
01:30:44,892 --> 01:30:46,525
throw your husband,
a man 20 years his senior,

1779
01:30:46,527 --> 01:30:47,459
o the ground

1780
01:30:47,825 --> 01:30:50,293
fracturing a rib
and very nearly his wrist?

1781
01:30:50,726 --> 01:30:51,725
Yes.

1782
01:30:52,159 --> 01:30:54,093
PROSECUTOR: Thank you.
No further questions.

1783
01:30:56,526 --> 01:30:57,690
(sighs)

1784
01:30:57,692 --> 01:30:58,993
You can step down now.

1785
01:30:59,461 --> 01:31:01,658
JUDGE: I'm going to suggest
that we take a brief recess here

1786
01:31:01,660 --> 01:31:05,427
while I review all of
the testimony and materials.

1787
01:31:05,661 --> 01:31:07,326
(stutters) I can't.

1788
01:31:07,561 --> 01:31:09,427
(people murmuring)

1789
01:31:11,427 --> 01:31:12,428
Excuse me?

1790
01:31:12,694 --> 01:31:14,025
I can't!

1791
01:31:14,027 --> 01:31:16,725
(stutters) I can't do this.

1792
01:31:16,727 --> 01:31:18,862
I thought I could, but I just...

1793
01:31:20,094 --> 01:31:21,292
I didn't see anything.

1794
01:31:21,294 --> 01:31:23,528
I'm only saying
what you told me to say.

1795
01:31:24,696 --> 01:31:26,962
I'm sorry,
but I can't do this anymore.

1796
01:31:27,361 --> 01:31:29,493
I know that Denny
loved Eve too much

1797
01:31:29,495 --> 01:31:30,493
to ever hurt her father.

1798
01:31:30,495 --> 01:31:32,826
Objection. The witness
is clearly speculating.

1799
01:31:32,828 --> 01:31:35,095
It's your witness, counselor.

1800
01:31:40,295 --> 01:31:42,229
MARK: <i>They dropped the charges.</i>

1801
01:31:42,561 --> 01:31:43,695
All of it. Tossed out.

1802
01:31:43,697 --> 01:31:44,828
(both laugh)

1803
01:31:44,830 --> 01:31:47,197
You did it, Denny.
It's over, man.

1804
01:31:47,763 --> 01:31:49,397
- (all laughing)
- (barks)

1805
01:31:50,097 --> 01:31:51,694
ENZO: <i>He'd done it.</i>

1806
01:31:51,696 --> 01:31:53,630
<i>Denny's risk had paid off.</i>

1807
01:31:54,464 --> 01:31:57,631
<i>If a driver has the courage
to create his own conditions...</i>

1808
01:31:58,263 --> 01:32:00,296
<i>then the rain is simply rain.</i>

1809
01:32:10,431 --> 01:32:11,365
Daddy!

1810
01:32:12,264 --> 01:32:14,296
- I missed you.
- DENNY: Oh, I missed you.

1811
01:32:14,298 --> 01:32:15,465
(Enzo barking)

1812
01:32:16,563 --> 01:32:18,265
ENZO: <i>Zoë was ours again.</i>

1813
01:32:19,432 --> 01:32:20,696
<i>Denny had won her back,</i>

1814
01:32:20,698 --> 01:32:22,465
<i>and it was a victory
for the ages.</i>

1815
01:32:31,700 --> 01:32:33,399
(phone ringing)

1816
01:32:37,099 --> 01:32:40,099
<i>Denny, this is Luca Pantoni
returning your call.</i>

1817
01:32:40,433 --> 01:32:41,698
Luca, yes, hi.

1818
01:32:41,700 --> 01:32:44,397
Thank you for calling me back.

1819
01:32:44,399 --> 01:32:47,097
I wanted to let you know
that the...

1820
01:32:47,099 --> 01:32:49,932
issues keeping me in the States
have been resolved.

1821
01:32:49,934 --> 01:32:51,164
ENZO: <i>I could just picture him</i>

1822
01:32:51,166 --> 01:32:53,630
<i>on the terrace
of some magnificent villa.</i>

1823
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:54,765
<i>I can tell by your voice</i>

1824
01:32:54,767 --> 01:32:56,565
they were resolved
to your satisfaction.

1825
01:32:56,567 --> 01:32:57,368
DENNY: <i>Yes, sir.</i>

1826
01:32:57,833 --> 01:33:01,832
And I was wondering if the job
that you'd offered me earlier,

1827
01:33:01,834 --> 01:33:03,969
- <i>if that was still available?</i>
- It is.

1828
01:33:04,768 --> 01:33:08,101
Then my daughter and I,
and our dog Enzo,

1829
01:33:08,501 --> 01:33:11,269
would very much like
to join you in Maranello.

1830
01:33:11,767 --> 01:33:13,435
Your dog's name is Enzo?

1831
01:33:13,835 --> 01:33:15,802
Yeah, he's a racecar driver
at heart.

1832
01:33:16,101 --> 01:33:19,103
<i>Okay, I will have my assistant
make all the arrangements.</i>

1833
01:33:19,568 --> 01:33:21,102
Welcome to Ferrari.

1834
01:33:21,569 --> 01:33:23,402
<i>We will talk again soon, Denny.</i>

1835
01:33:24,135 --> 01:33:25,035
<i>Ciao.</i>

1836
01:33:26,436 --> 01:33:27,503
<i>Ciao.</i>

1837
01:33:30,268 --> 01:33:31,569
(chuckling)

1838
01:33:35,036 --> 01:33:37,500
- GIRL: What is it, Zoë?
- KIDS: Wow!

1839
01:33:37,502 --> 01:33:39,900
MAN: This is a great party,
look at these gifts, it's great.

1840
01:33:39,902 --> 01:33:41,134
- Nice cake, Denny.
- WOMAN: So cute.

1841
01:33:41,136 --> 01:33:42,501
- "Wishing for you...
- (doorbell rings)

1842
01:33:42,503 --> 01:33:44,303
...a fairy tale birthday."

1843
01:33:44,704 --> 01:33:46,037
What'd you get?

1844
01:33:46,704 --> 01:33:48,470
- ZOË: Daddy, look!
- Oh, cool.

1845
01:33:51,970 --> 01:33:53,337
(sighs) I don't...

1846
01:33:54,271 --> 01:33:56,005
If you want me to go, I could...

1847
01:34:07,104 --> 01:34:08,771
- ZOË: Grandma!
- TRISH: Hi, sweetheart.

1848
01:34:09,039 --> 01:34:11,371
ENZO: <i>I might not have been
as forgiving.</i>

1849
01:34:12,205 --> 01:34:14,473
<i>But Denny had Zoë
to think about.</i>

1850
01:34:18,772 --> 01:34:22,272
<i>I'd often heard the expression
"to be the better man."</i>

1851
01:34:22,873 --> 01:34:23,873
ZOË: Grandpa!

1852
01:34:24,106 --> 01:34:26,472
ENZO: <i>Well, I knew
no better man than Denny.</i>

1853
01:34:26,806 --> 01:34:28,106
Big number nine.

1854
01:34:29,373 --> 01:34:30,606
Big number nine.

1855
01:34:31,307 --> 01:34:32,306
All right.

1856
01:34:32,639 --> 01:34:34,006
- You ready?
- Ready...

1857
01:34:34,373 --> 01:34:36,373
BOTH: steady... go!

1858
01:34:36,807 --> 01:34:39,170
- WOMAN: Aw...
- (all cheering)

1859
01:34:39,172 --> 01:34:41,207
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks, Daddy.

1860
01:34:41,807 --> 01:34:43,504
- Okay, who wants cake?
- ZOË AND KIDS: Me!

1861
01:34:43,506 --> 01:34:45,939
Yeah? Okay, Grandma,
will you help me with this?

1862
01:34:45,941 --> 01:34:47,375
Grab a knife from the kitchen.

1863
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:50,006
ENZO: <i>Sometimes my life
seems like it has been</i>

1864
01:34:50,008 --> 01:34:53,041
<i>so long and so short
at the same time.</i>

1865
01:34:54,308 --> 01:34:57,009
<i>I feel as if I've lived
for an eternity.</i>

1866
01:34:58,908 --> 01:34:59,941
DENNY: Yo, Enz!

1867
01:35:00,241 --> 01:35:03,242
ENZO: <i>And yet it's as if no time
has passed at all.</i>

1868
01:35:04,375 --> 01:35:05,442
DENNY: Enzo?

1869
01:35:05,940 --> 01:35:08,041
ENZO: <i>I hear the worry
in his voice.</i>

1870
01:35:09,108 --> 01:35:10,642
DENNY: What happened, pal?

1871
01:35:13,776 --> 01:35:14,676
Oh, Enz.

1872
01:35:14,875 --> 01:35:16,509
ENZO: <i>I can smell the day
on him.</i>

1873
01:35:16,842 --> 01:35:20,375
<i>Motor oil and gasoline
and roast chicken.</i>

1874
01:35:20,377 --> 01:35:21,610
Can you get up, bud?

1875
01:35:23,509 --> 01:35:27,343
ENZO: <i>I saw a documentary
about Mongolia on TV once.</i>

1876
01:35:27,809 --> 01:35:29,743
DENNY: Oh... Okay.

1877
01:35:30,043 --> 01:35:31,975
ENZO: <i>In Mongolia,
when a dog dies,</i>

1878
01:35:31,977 --> 01:35:33,408
<i>he is buried high in the hills,</i>

1879
01:35:33,410 --> 01:35:35,375
<i>so people cannot walk
on his grave.</i>

1880
01:35:35,377 --> 01:35:37,943
DENNY: <i>I'm here, buddy.
I'm right here.</i>

1881
01:35:38,177 --> 01:35:40,608
ENZO: <i>His master whispers
into the dog's ears</i>

1882
01:35:40,610 --> 01:35:42,943
<i>his wishes that in his next life</i>

1883
01:35:42,945 --> 01:35:45,012
<i>the dog will return as a man.</i>

1884
01:35:46,112 --> 01:35:49,044
<i>Not all dogs return as men,
they say.</i>

1885
01:35:49,578 --> 01:35:50,678
<i>Only those who are ready.</i>

1886
01:35:51,112 --> 01:35:52,578
Let's get you up.

1887
01:35:53,645 --> 01:35:55,045
ENZO: <i>I am ready.</i>

1888
01:35:55,645 --> 01:35:57,346
(grunting)

1889
01:36:01,045 --> 01:36:03,278
ENZO: <i>I know death is not
the end.</i>

1890
01:36:03,811 --> 01:36:05,212
<i>Eve told me so.</i>

1891
01:36:05,713 --> 01:36:07,045
<i>And I believe her.</i>

1892
01:36:09,179 --> 01:36:10,645
<i>When I return to this world,</i>

1893
01:36:10,647 --> 01:36:12,243
<i>I will practically be an adult</i>

1894
01:36:12,245 --> 01:36:13,977
<i>the moment I am plucked
from the womb</i>

1895
01:36:13,979 --> 01:36:16,146
<i>with all the preparation
I have done.</i>

1896
01:36:17,378 --> 01:36:18,376
There he is.

1897
01:36:18,378 --> 01:36:20,377
ENZO: <i>I will walk among
my fellow men,</i>

1898
01:36:20,379 --> 01:36:23,245
<i>lick my lips
with my small dexterous tongue</i>

1899
01:36:23,247 --> 01:36:25,511
<i>and shake hands
with a firm grasp.</i>

1900
01:36:25,513 --> 01:36:26,978
DENNY: There's my Enzo.

1901
01:36:26,980 --> 01:36:29,247
ENZO: <i>And I will teach people
all that I know.</i>

1902
01:36:29,746 --> 01:36:31,347
<i>All that I have learned.</i>

1903
01:36:41,314 --> 01:36:44,148
- You okay now?
- ENZO: <i>I'm fine, Denny.</i>

1904
01:36:44,514 --> 01:36:45,645
<i>I am.</i>

1905
01:36:45,647 --> 01:36:47,314
You've always been with me.

1906
01:36:48,849 --> 01:36:50,582
You've always been my Enzo.

1907
01:36:52,514 --> 01:36:53,713
DENNY: First time I saw you,

1908
01:36:53,715 --> 01:36:55,448
I knew we were supposed
to be together.

1909
01:36:59,148 --> 01:37:00,315
(sighs)

1910
01:37:01,849 --> 01:37:03,216
I love you, boy.

1911
01:37:18,816 --> 01:37:20,315
What are you doing here?

1912
01:37:20,317 --> 01:37:21,981
DENNY: I thought we'd go
to the track.

1913
01:37:21,983 --> 01:37:23,417
'Cause I have
a surprise for Enzo.

1914
01:37:35,850 --> 01:37:37,149
Thanks for arranging this, Don.

1915
01:37:37,151 --> 01:37:38,649
We won't be out long.

1916
01:37:38,651 --> 01:37:40,249
Take your time.
Track's all yours.

1917
01:37:40,251 --> 01:37:41,116
Okay.

1918
01:37:41,118 --> 01:37:43,218
- Have fun.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

1919
01:37:45,519 --> 01:37:47,519
Not too tight? Okay.

1920
01:37:47,952 --> 01:37:49,848
- You ready?
- (barking)

1921
01:37:49,850 --> 01:37:50,983
All right.

1922
01:37:50,985 --> 01:37:52,850
Drivers, start your engines.

1923
01:37:52,852 --> 01:37:54,085
(starts engine)

1924
01:38:03,386 --> 01:38:06,187
ENZO: <i>I have never ever felt
so special.</i>

1925
01:38:08,854 --> 01:38:10,287
You did it, man.

1926
01:38:17,853 --> 01:38:20,719
Brakes are warm, tires are warm.

1927
01:38:20,721 --> 01:38:22,451
What do you say we try
a hot lap, huh?

1928
01:38:22,453 --> 01:38:23,388
(barking)

1929
01:38:28,853 --> 01:38:30,954
ENZO: <i>I'd like
to stay out here forever.</i>

1930
01:38:37,055 --> 01:38:39,189
- <i>Stay with them forever.</i>
- (giggling)

1931
01:38:46,189 --> 01:38:48,953
We're gonna take this one
at speed. You okay?

1932
01:38:48,955 --> 01:38:50,155
(barking)

1933
01:38:54,522 --> 01:38:57,423
ENZO: <i>I wish I could glimpse
what awaits them in Maranello.</i>

1934
01:38:59,222 --> 01:39:02,156
<i>Denny will be
a wonderful driver for Ferrari.</i>

1935
01:39:03,191 --> 01:39:04,787
<i>So wonderful that one day</i>

1936
01:39:04,789 --> 01:39:06,355
<i>they will pluck him
from the ranks</i>

1937
01:39:06,357 --> 01:39:08,923
<i>to give him a tryout
for their Formula One team.</i>

1938
01:39:09,823 --> 01:39:11,391
<i>"Try me," he'll say.</i>

1939
01:39:11,791 --> 01:39:13,258
<i>I'd like to see that.</i>

1940
01:39:14,925 --> 01:39:16,357
(laughing) Enzo!

1941
01:39:16,958 --> 01:39:19,025
ENZO: <i>But we can't have
everything we want.</i>

1942
01:39:19,524 --> 01:39:22,892
<i>Besides, the best drivers don't
dwell on the future or the past.</i>

1943
01:39:25,125 --> 01:39:27,992
<i>The best drivers
focus only on the present.</i>

1944
01:39:31,090 --> 01:39:32,892
You've been a good friend.

1945
01:39:34,725 --> 01:39:36,557
A very good friend.

1946
01:39:37,058 --> 01:39:38,591
ENZO: <i>The best of friends.</i>

1947
01:39:41,325 --> 01:39:42,292
Come here.

1948
01:39:45,259 --> 01:39:47,226
ENZO:
<i>We'll be heading home soon.</i>

1949
01:39:49,192 --> 01:39:52,094
<i>But for now,
all I want is one more lap.</i>

1950
01:39:52,659 --> 01:39:54,027
<i>Just one more.</i>

1951
01:39:55,959 --> 01:39:58,258
<i>I'll bark again so he knows.</i>

1952
01:39:58,260 --> 01:39:59,327
(barks)

1953
01:40:11,328 --> 01:40:12,528
<i>Faster, Denny.</i>

1954
01:40:12,893 --> 01:40:14,261
<i>Faster!</i>

1955
01:40:33,896 --> 01:40:36,429
(announcer speaking Italian
on PA)

1956
01:40:45,229 --> 01:40:47,962
(all speaking in Italian)

1957
01:40:52,429 --> 01:40:54,430
(man speaking Italian)

1958
01:40:56,862 --> 01:40:58,131
(in English) Dad!

1959
01:41:00,363 --> 01:41:02,261
There's some people
who want to meet you.

1960
01:41:02,263 --> 01:41:04,262
- Uh...
- Come on, they're big fans.

1961
01:41:04,264 --> 01:41:05,962
I think you'd really like them.

1962
01:41:05,964 --> 01:41:07,197
You're the boss.

1963
01:41:07,631 --> 01:41:09,228
(both speaking in Italian)

1964
01:41:09,230 --> 01:41:10,495
MAN: (in English)
We are your biggest fans.

1965
01:41:10,497 --> 01:41:12,663
Your daughter said that
you would not mind.

1966
01:41:12,998 --> 01:41:14,399
No, of course not.

1967
01:41:14,697 --> 01:41:17,662
My son,
he talks about you always.

1968
01:41:17,664 --> 01:41:18,762
(speaks Italian)

1969
01:41:18,764 --> 01:41:20,531
He races the go-karts.
He's very good.

1970
01:41:21,332 --> 01:41:22,532
<i>Bene. Va bene.</i>

1971
01:41:22,832 --> 01:41:24,762
Oh, could you please sign
the program?

1972
01:41:24,764 --> 01:41:25,665
Sure.

1973
01:41:26,164 --> 01:41:28,364
We are going to watch the race
from the infield tomorrow.

1974
01:41:28,366 --> 01:41:29,630
DENNY: Hmm.

1975
01:41:29,632 --> 01:41:30,665
(speaking Italian)

1976
01:41:31,498 --> 01:41:32,399
Enzo.

1977
01:41:34,433 --> 01:41:35,497
Enzo?

1978
01:41:35,499 --> 01:41:37,097
(speaking Italian)

1979
01:41:37,099 --> 01:41:38,500
(in English)
My name is Enzo.

1980
01:41:40,132 --> 01:41:41,697
MAN: He wants to be a champion.

1981
01:41:41,699 --> 01:41:42,933
Like you.

1982
01:41:45,565 --> 01:41:46,500
<i>Mi scusi.</i>

1983
01:41:47,567 --> 01:41:50,967
(in English) Your son reminds
me of an old friend of mine.

1984
01:41:55,833 --> 01:41:57,800
My phone number in Maranello.

1985
01:41:58,634 --> 01:42:01,098
When you think your son
is ready, give me a call.

1986
01:42:01,100 --> 01:42:02,966
DENNY: I'll make sure
he gets proper instruction.

1987
01:42:02,968 --> 01:42:05,665
<i>Grazie.</i>
He talks about you always.

1988
01:42:05,667 --> 01:42:08,533
MAN: He says that you are
the greatest driver ever.

1989
01:42:08,535 --> 01:42:09,866
Better even than Senna.

1990
01:42:09,868 --> 01:42:11,133
(both laugh)

1991
01:42:11,135 --> 01:42:13,035
Well, he's a racecar driver
at heart.

1992
01:42:13,535 --> 01:42:15,000
<i>Grazie! Grazie mille!</i>

1993
01:42:15,002 --> 01:42:16,498
<i>Grazie!</i>

1994
01:42:16,500 --> 01:42:17,668
<i>Prego.</i>

1995
01:42:31,503 --> 01:42:32,469
Come on.

1996
