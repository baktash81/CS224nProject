The question isn't,
"Why did he invite her?"

How many of these boxes did you create?

506
00:26:21,708 --> 00:26:25,292
- Five. One for each of my friends.
- No test boxes? No prototypes?

507
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,750
No, my puzzle guy barely got the five done
in time,

508
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:29,250
and he apprenticed with Ricky Jay.

509

and the puzzles completed,

is there any way to close them again?
To… To reset 'em?

Hang on. Hang on.

512

Why? I've got the predefinite detective

That is so legit.

[sighs] Mr. Bron, I've learned
through bitter experience

521
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:10,667
that an anonymous invitation
is not to be trifled with.

Okay, look, come on.
I'd love to have you visit me in my home.

You really try. I like that.
You really make an effort.

I mean, just because she says
what everyone's thinking,

- Oh, I left it in my room.
- [Miles] Okay.

641
00:33:18,208 --> 00:33:22,208
If you want to shake things up,
you start with something small.

642
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:24,792
You break a norm,
or an idea, or a convention,

some little business model.

644
00:33:26,042 --> 00:33:29,458
But you go with things
that people are kind of tired of anyway.

645
00:33:29,542 --> 00:33:32,667
Everybody gets excited
because you're busting up something

646
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,833
that everyone wanted broken
in the first place.

647
00:33:36,083 --> 00:33:39,000
That's the infraction point.

648
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:42,625
That's the place
where you have to look within yourself

649
00:33:43,417 --> 00:33:46,667
and ask, "Am I the kind of person
who will keep going?"

650
00:33:47,917 --> 00:33:49,333
Will you break more things?

651
00:33:50,292 --> 00:33:51,958
Break bigger things?

652
00:33:52,042 --> 00:33:56,917

that nobody wants you to break?

653
00:33:57,875 --> 00:34:01,750
Because at that point,
people are not gonna be on your side.

654
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:03,833
They're gonna call you crazy.

655
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:07,125
They're gonna say you're a bully.
They're gonna tell you to stop.

656
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,417
Even your partner will say,
"You need to stop."

657
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:13,917
Because as it turns out,

658
00:34:14,875 --> 00:34:18,958
nobody wants you to break
the system itself.

659
00:34:20,208 --> 00:34:23,375
But that is what true disruption is.

660
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:28,042
And that is what unites all of us.

661
00:34:29,292 --> 00:34:32,750
We all got to that line and crossed it.

00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,417

00:44:05,125 --> 00:44:08,125
[Miles] That's a new solid hydrogen fuel.
It's incredibly powerful.

841
00:44:08,208 --> 00:44:09,458
It's radically efficient.

842
00:44:09,542 --> 00:44:13,542
Zero carbon emissions,
and it's derived from abundant seawater.

843
00:44:14,458 --> 00:44:16,458
I call it Klear, with a K.

844
00:44:16,542 --> 00:44:20,500
And at this event,
we are going to announce "Klear America."

845
00:44:20,583 --> 00:44:22,583
Our affordable home power solution.

846
00:44:22,667 --> 00:44:25,333
Klear is going to be powering
people's dreams,

847
00:44:25,417 --> 00:44:27,917
all over this country,
by the end of this year.

848
00:44:28,792 --> 00:44:30,500
- [glass shield thuds]
- [sighs]

849
00:44:30,583 --> 00:44:31,417
No.

850
00:44:32,625 --> 00:44:34,917
No. Because I was clear with you.

851
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,708
I told you I need two years minimum

852
00:44:37,792 --> 00:44:40,917
to test this stuff
to see if it's safe or even viable.

853
00:44:42,125 --> 00:44:45,542
Claire and I are not gonna be responsible
for putting something out in the world

854
00:44:45,625 --> 00:44:47,292
before it's tested and...

855
00:44:52,208 --> 00:44:53,208
Oh, no.

856
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,208
Oh, yeah.

857
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:56,708
No.

858
00:44:56,792 --> 00:45:00,750
You're running this entire place off this?

859
00:45:00,833 --> 00:45:03,208
All of it. All this awesome lighting,

860
00:45:03,917 --> 00:45:07,000
the heating and cooling,
everything right down to my fax machine.

861
00:45:07,917 --> 00:45:10,958
The whole Glass Onion is powered by Klear.

862
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:12,333
Oh my God, Miles.

863
00:45:13,708 --> 00:45:15,750
Guys, we did it.

864
00:45:15,833 --> 00:45:16,792
I'm out. I'm done.

865
00:45:18,417 --> 00:45:22,375
This is reckless.
And you're gonna get somebody killed.

866
00:45:22,458 --> 00:45:24,292
Bro, you're not getting out.

867
00:45:24,917 --> 00:45:26,292
It's already happening.

868
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:29,917
I love you. Come on, let's… Let's eat!

869
00:45:31,542 --> 00:45:32,917
[Lionel sighs heavily]

870
00:45:34,417 --> 00:45:35,625
Okay, gang.

871
00:45:36,625 --> 00:45:41,500
It's been a memorable weekend already,
to be sure, but now the real fun starts.

872
00:45:43,083 --> 00:45:47,417
We got three days to bask in the sun,
swim in the Ionian Sea,

873
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,750
eat good food and wine,
and enjoy each other's company.

874
00:45:49,833 --> 00:45:54,958
But alongside and underneath the partay,
you've been charged with a serious task.

875
00:45:55,583 --> 00:46:00,750
Because tonight, in this very room,
a murder will be committed.

876
00:46:00,833 --> 00:46:01,833
[Claire scoffs]

877
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:03,375
My murder.

878
00:46:04,375 --> 00:46:06,708
You will have
to closely observe the crime.

879
00:46:07,333 --> 00:46:09,000
Consider what you know about each other.

880
00:46:09,083 --> 00:46:12,375
Know that across the island,
I've hidden clues.

881
00:46:12,458 --> 00:46:16,625
Some may be helpful, some may misdirect.
That's for you to determine.

882
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:23,542
But if anyone can name the killer,
tell me how they achieved the murder,

883
00:46:23,625 --> 00:46:26,875
and, most importantly,
what was the motive,

884
00:46:26,958 --> 00:46:29,042
that person wins our game.

885
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:33,583
Any questions?

886
00:46:33,667 --> 00:46:36,625
Uh, wait… What do we win?

887
00:46:37,917 --> 00:46:40,250
I… What do you mean? What do you…

888
00:46:41,083 --> 00:46:42,125
What do you want?

889
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,792
No. No, nothing, I just…

890
00:46:44,875 --> 00:46:47,458
I just thought maybe
there was a prize or something.

891
00:46:48,292 --> 00:46:51,042
I… An iPad or like…

892
00:46:53,708 --> 00:46:56,125
Okay, fine.
<font color="white">Yeah, no, the winner gets an iPad.

893
00:46:57,083 --> 00:47:01,875
And, uh, once you're dead,
will we still be able to talk to you?

894
00:47:02,583 --> 00:47:05,542
Yeah, I'm not playing dead
the whole weekend, dude. [splutters]

895
00:47:05,625 --> 00:47:06,708
We hang, but I…

896
00:47:06,792 --> 00:47:09,417
You just can't ask me questions.
I'm not gonna help.

897
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:13,000
I don't actually need an iPad.
I'm just saying. It's just…

898
00:47:13,083 --> 00:47:16,583
When you said "win," it…
You know, it made me say it.

899
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,458
Can we, um, work together?

900
00:47:19,292 --> 00:47:21,708
[Miles] Um, only one person
can solve the crime,

901
00:47:21,792 --> 00:47:25,583
so if you got a theory,
keep it close to your chest.

902
00:47:25,667 --> 00:47:28,958
It's designed to be hard.
This will take the whole weekend.

903
00:47:29,042 --> 00:47:30,792
Well, this is truly delightful.

904
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:34,292
Oh! Have we started already, is it...

905
00:47:34,375 --> 00:47:36,792
- Well, the murder hasn't happened. But…
- Oh, yeah.

906
00:47:36,875 --> 00:47:39,417
Yeah, why not? As Watson said to Holmes...

907
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:43,458
It was Birdie
who planted a remote device on a crossbow

908
00:47:43,542 --> 00:47:47,542
in revenge for you stealing
her signature Ren Diamond.

909
00:47:51,708 --> 00:47:53,458
Look at the seating arrangement.

910
00:47:54,042 --> 00:47:58,375
It triangulates Birdie
just perfectly with that thing,

911
00:47:58,958 --> 00:48:00,958
which is loaded with a dummy bolt.

912
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:03,667
Aimed directly…

913
00:48:06,417 --> 00:48:07,542
at Mr. Bron.

914
00:48:08,208 --> 00:48:13,333
Now I believe close inspection will reveal
some sort of remote triggering device,

915
00:48:13,417 --> 00:48:19,500
but more damning,
that is a vintage Jayhawk brand crossbow.

916
00:48:20,292 --> 00:48:22,167
Jayhawk, Birdie Jay.

917
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:25,875
Of course, there are other superfluous
and rather clumsy clues.

918
00:48:25,958 --> 00:48:28,375
The hedgerow
in the south garden spells letter B.

919
00:48:28,458 --> 00:48:31,833
Birdie's room is the sacral chakra,
which is the one blocked by guilt.

920
00:48:31,917 --> 00:48:35,958
Blah, blah, blah. But the motive, yes,

921
00:48:36,042 --> 00:48:40,000
on the cleverly planted 1998 issue
of </font><i><font color="white">The Face</i> magazine

922
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,750
with Birdie on the cover…

923
00:48:41,833 --> 00:48:46,917
[chuckles] …she famously wore
what became known as the Ren Diamond.

924
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
And that's a family heirloom, I believe.

925
00:48:49,083 --> 00:48:53,958
Well, to be clear, I mean, I didn't know
what a "blood diamond" was so...

926
00:48:54,042 --> 00:49:00,083
Mr. Bron, the large pendulous locket
which is… Has not left your neck.

927
00:49:00,167 --> 00:49:04,042
[chuckles] Bit out of keeping
with your breezy island style.

928
00:49:04,792 --> 00:49:06,667
Would you kindly open it for us?

929
00:49:12,875 --> 00:49:13,875
[screams]

930
00:49:14,792 --> 00:49:15,875
My Ren Diamond!

931
00:49:15,958 --> 00:49:20,500
A dramatic, passionate
and colorful crime for a fashionista.

932
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:21,917
Miss Birdie Jay.

933
00:49:22,792 --> 00:49:28,208
Unfortunately, this crime clashed
with the presence of Benoit Blanc.

934
00:49:33,833 --> 00:49:34,792
[Benoit laughs] Oh!

935
00:49:34,875 --> 00:49:39,500
That… See that? That just went up…
Very good. Very good.

936
00:49:41,833 --> 00:49:48,167
My God, that just felt so good.
So solid, so satisfying!

937
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:51,625
You know, like one of those
mini-crosswords <i>The Times</i><font color="white"> has

938
00:49:51,708 --> 00:49:56,083
or, you know, I have a chef friend,
and she speaks of trying to create

939
00:49:56,167 --> 00:50:01,833
the perfect bite and that just felt like
the most satisfying bite-sized...

940
00:50:08,333 --> 00:50:09,167
You're angry.

941
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:15,000
No, Blanc, I'm, uh, just, you know…

942
00:50:15,708 --> 00:50:16,708
What the hell?

943
00:50:17,625 --> 00:50:21,458
That was not
the simplest thing to set up, so…

944
00:50:21,542 --> 00:50:24,208
It's fine. It doesn't matter. It's just…

945
00:50:24,292 --> 00:50:26,667
I hired Gillian Flynn
to write the whole thing...

946
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:30,583
- Oh, she's quite good.
- She's goddamn expensive, is what she is.

947
00:50:31,458 --> 00:50:35,333
What am I supposed to do now?
Play Yahtzee all weekend? Just… [exhales]

948
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:42,333
Mr. Bron, truth is,
I… I ruined your game on purpose

949
00:50:43,458 --> 00:50:45,458
and for a very good reason.

950
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:46,875
I'm sorry, what?

951
00:50:48,833 --> 00:50:51,708
I like the Glass Onion as a metaphor.

952
00:50:51,792 --> 00:50:54,667
An object that seems densely layered,

953
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:57,583
but in reality
the center is in plain sight.

954
00:50:58,167 --> 00:51:01,708
Your relationship with these people
may seem complex,

955
00:51:01,792 --> 00:51:04,833
but look, what you've done
this weekend is crystal clear.

956
00:51:05,958 --> 00:51:07,417
You've taken seven people,

957
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:10,792
each of whom has a real-life reason
to wish you harm,

958
00:51:10,875 --> 00:51:13,792
gathered them together on a remote island

959
00:51:13,875 --> 00:51:17,250
and placed the idea
of your murder in their heads.

960
00:51:18,583 --> 00:51:22,375
It's like putting a loaded gun
on the table and turning off the lights!

961
00:51:22,458 --> 00:51:24,167
Oh, whoa. [chuckles]

962
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:25,375
Come on.

963
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,750
So you play hardball with Lionel,
threaten to destroy his reputation

964
00:51:30,833 --> 00:51:34,500
if he does not play along
and power a manned rocket with Klear.

965
00:51:34,583 --> 00:51:36,250
But now with Claire too…

966
00:51:36,333 --> 00:51:39,083
Now perhaps,
you threaten to support her opponent

967
00:51:39,167 --> 00:51:43,958
in the up-and-coming election
if she does not approve your power plant.

968
00:51:44,542 --> 00:51:46,208
You have done some homework.

969
00:51:46,292 --> 00:51:49,000
And Birdie. Bangladesh.

970
00:51:49,083 --> 00:51:51,958
Sweetie Pants are manufactured there
in a sweatshop.

971
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:55,458
You're making Birdie take the fall
to cover your ass as the main investor.

972
00:51:56,917 --> 00:52:02,375
And Duke? Well… [chuckles]
…we all know why Duke wants to kill you.

973
00:52:02,958 --> 00:52:04,208
He doesn't know about that.

974
00:52:04,792 --> 00:52:06,208
Yes, he does.

975
00:52:07,667 --> 00:52:10,667
Take my presence as a sign.

976
00:52:11,375 --> 00:52:16,500
For at least one person on this island,
this is not a game.

977
00:52:19,208 --> 00:52:21,833
Oh, this is the famous napkin!

978
00:52:21,917 --> 00:52:23,792
I know this story.

979
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,125
- Right…
<font color="white">- Will you look at that?

980
00:52:26,208 --> 00:52:29,708
I sketched out the original idea
for Alpha on a cocktail napkin

981
00:52:29,792 --> 00:52:32,583
and I showed it to Andi one night
at the Glass Onion.

982
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:34,792
That was our local bar.

983
00:52:36,375 --> 00:52:40,792
That's where it all began.
But they tore it down the year after that.

984
00:52:40,875 --> 00:52:41,750
[Benoit] Mm-hmm.

985
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:44,500
[sighs] Andi.

986
00:52:45,625 --> 00:52:46,792
Yes, Andi.

987
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:49,875
Andi used to tell me the truth.

988
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:52,458
Nobody does that now.

989
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:56,167
It's all just fake smiles and agendas

990
00:52:56,250 --> 00:53:00,250
and people wanting
what they think they're owed.

991
00:53:00,833 --> 00:53:06,000
Hating you when you don't give it to them
because that's what you're there for.

992
00:53:10,292 --> 00:53:15,333
I know it's probably hard to have sympathy
for the poor, tortured billionaire. But…

993
00:53:16,708 --> 00:53:18,417
God damn, I miss that bar.

00:53:57,042 --> 00:53:59,875
Well, I'm out of here.
Tomorrow morning. Gone.

1007
00:54:00,458 --> 00:54:01,708
We just got here.

1008
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:03,458
[imitates crying]

1009
00:54:03,542 --> 00:54:05,542
You can stay, have fun.

1010
00:54:05,625 --> 00:54:08,292
- Fine. You're murdering my vibe.
- [cell phone ringing]

1011
00:54:08,375 --> 00:54:11,792
[Lionel] Well, I hate saying this
in any context,

1012
00:54:11,875 --> 00:54:12,792
but I'm with Duke.

1013
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:16,583
Or we can get drunk
and enjoy paradise for the weekend.

1014
00:54:16,667 --> 00:54:18,750
We should probably go too.

1015
00:54:18,833 --> 00:54:22,792
No. Miserable in paradise.
We've all earned this.

1016
00:54:22,875 --> 00:54:24,042
Yes, you have.

1017
00:54:29,542 --> 00:54:32,083
Are we even gonna talk about
the elephant in the room?

1018
00:54:32,583 --> 00:54:35,625
Or just gonna throw a blanket over it
and push through the weekend?

1019
00:54:35,708 --> 00:54:36,667
Am I the elephant?

1020
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:39,250
Yeah. You're the elephant!

1021
00:54:39,333 --> 00:54:40,333
You're not that bad.

1022
00:54:40,417 --> 00:54:42,125
[Lionel] What'd you come for, Andi?

1023
00:54:42,875 --> 00:54:45,333
Given the circumstances,
I think it's a fair question.

1024
00:54:45,958 --> 00:54:46,792
Fair?

1025
00:54:46,875 --> 00:54:51,875
Oh my God. Yes, no, fine.
Nothing about any of this is fair.

1026
00:54:51,958 --> 00:54:53,583
Congratulations. Now, you know.

1027
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:58,958
And we all stuck with Miles.
What do you want?

1028
00:54:59,833 --> 00:55:04,708
Do you wanna know why we did it? Hmm?
Really? Why? Do the math. It's easy math.

1029
00:55:05,708 --> 00:55:09,667
[scoffs] So you come here,
in your Gucci flats, telling us…

1030
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:10,583
Valentino.

1031
00:55:10,667 --> 00:55:11,792
…that we owe you?

1032
00:55:12,458 --> 00:55:14,833
You made money off of Alpha
all those years.

1033
00:55:14,917 --> 00:55:16,583
You did fine. You got yours.

1034
00:55:16,667 --> 00:55:17,500
I got?

1035
00:55:18,625 --> 00:55:23,000
No, he got his from me. All of it!

1036
00:55:23,583 --> 00:55:28,292
My life was taken away from me
by someone, by everyone in this room.

1037
00:55:28,375 --> 00:55:31,500
My life! Do you even know what that means?

1038
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:32,625
Huh?

1039
00:55:32,708 --> 00:55:35,417
What Claire's trying to say,
is we're sorry.

1040
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:38,708
We feel bad for you. What do you want?

1041
00:55:38,792 --> 00:55:41,250
- Are you really asking me that?
- [Claire] Yes. What do you want?

1042
00:55:41,333 --> 00:55:43,542
A check? You want performative pity?

1043
00:55:43,625 --> 00:55:44,625
[sighs]

1044
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:47,458
Just tell us the right words
that we can use

1045
00:55:47,542 --> 00:55:49,417
so that we can get on with our lives.

1046
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:52,083
You want revenge?
You want to slit Miles' throat?

1047
00:55:52,792 --> 00:55:56,917
You wanna take us all down?
What? Just drop the bombshell! Say it!

1048
00:55:57,875 --> 00:55:59,625
- Say it!
<font color="white">- I want the truth!

I want the truth.

1051
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,167
I can give you that.

1052
00:56:09,917 --> 00:56:11,125
I'll be the asshole.

[sighs]

1054
00:56:14,917 --> 00:56:20,708
The truth is, is that we
are all holding on to that golden tit.

1055
00:56:21,583 --> 00:56:23,375
We're all playing
the same game here, honey.

1056
00:56:24,542 --> 00:56:25,500
You lost.

1057
00:56:26,708 --> 00:56:29,167
So you can go ahead
and put yourself up on a cross

1058
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:32,750
like some unspeakable crime
has been committed against you

1059
00:56:32,833 --> 00:56:34,792
that none of us could possibly imagine.

1060
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:41,042
But me, I'm tired of pretending
like you're the victim in this game.

1061
00:56:42,292 --> 00:56:43,708
You just couldn't hack it.

1062
00:56:45,833 --> 00:56:49,500
You're the loser. There. That's the truth.

[Miles] Okay.

1069
00:57:04,375 --> 00:57:05,917
Oh, jeez, detective.

1070
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,250
Your next assignment
is who killed the party.

1071

- [Miles] Come on, guys!
- [glass shield thuds]

1073
00:57:11,958 --> 00:57:15,458
Blanc ruined my game. It's okay.
Hey, Alpha DJ, give us something upbeat!

1074
00:57:15,542 --> 00:57:18,167
Miles, I'm gonna be leaving
in the morning.

1075

- ["Star" by David Bowie playing]
- Yeah, me too.

1076
00:57:20,875 --> 00:57:24,292
No. No, we're having a champagne brunch
on the beach tomorrow.

1077
00:57:24,375 --> 00:57:25,750
You're gonna try foil surfing,

1078
00:57:25,833 --> 00:57:28,125
and you're gonna put some aloe on,
work on that tan,

1079
00:57:28,208 --> 00:57:30,708
and make your constituents say,
"What was she doing in lockdown?"

1080
00:57:30,792 --> 00:57:32,417
Birdie, come on, dance with me.

1081
00:57:33,125 --> 00:57:36,792
Come on, pretty lady, get that smile up.
Come on, come on.

There it is, there's my guy.

You look like you got good news.

1087

why my Googs are blowing up.

1088

Ooh!

1090
00:57:57,708 --> 00:58:00,917
This is all over the Internet.
I mean, look at those numbers.

1091
00:58:02,042 --> 00:58:04,167
That's fire. That changes things, right?

1092
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:05,500
It sure does.

1093
00:58:05,583 --> 00:58:09,458
Numbers like this.
Maybe we can talk Alpha News?

1094
00:58:09,542 --> 00:58:11,667
- You bet your ass. Come here.
- [laughs]

1095
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:15,542
- Congratulations.
- Dukey! That's amazing! Let me see!

1096
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:17,250

Have we ever not pulled through?
Pulled it off?

Five minutes ago, Blanc was telling me
that this whole party was a dangerous idea

'cause you all hate me so much
that one of you would actually wanna…

Wow! Look at that dress spin.
Birdie, that's amazing.

We're going in the pool tonight!

Did he choke? What happened?

[Benoit] There was no obstruction
in his airways.

[crying]

1173
01:01:55,208 --> 01:01:57,750
I think Mr. Blanc's…

1174
01:01:58,375 --> 01:02:01,250
You're not saying
it was done with intention, are you?

1175
01:02:01,333 --> 01:02:02,625
Well, we don't know.

1176
01:02:03,333 --> 01:02:06,750
But Mr. Cody's death was
so acute and violent… yes.

1177
01:02:08,292 --> 01:02:13,333
My guess is something
was put in his drink, intentionally.

1178
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:17,000
[dramatic music playing]

1179
01:02:19,583 --> 01:02:21,875
What do you mean "morning"?
How's that possible?

1180
01:02:21,958 --> 01:02:24,500
[Andino] <i><font color="white">Pisceshite! Dock is Pisceshite!</i>

1181
01:02:24,583 --> 01:02:26,792
Piece-of-shite. Piece of…

1182
01:02:29,833 --> 01:02:33,625
Boat can't come till low tide
in the morning. 6:00 a.m. at the earliest.

1183
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:35,958
Do they understand the situation?

1184
01:02:36,042 --> 01:02:37,667
There is no other landing point,

1185
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:41,250
and Miles' dumbass Banksy dock
was set to low-tide height

1186
01:02:41,333 --> 01:02:43,708
and it isn't buoyant.
It is a piece of shit.

1187
01:02:43,792 --> 01:02:47,125
Oh, heck. Yeah, all right, all right. Um…

1188
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:52,292
I suggest you all retire to your rooms,
lock the doors until 5:30,

1189
01:02:53,042 --> 01:02:56,208
when we will convene here
and walk together to the dock.

1190
01:02:56,292 --> 01:02:57,833
I'll stay up all night with the body.

1191
01:02:57,917 --> 01:03:00,792
Make sure it's not tampered with
in any way.

1192
01:03:00,875 --> 01:03:03,542
I recommend that everyone gets some sleep.

1193
01:03:08,417 --> 01:03:10,000
Oh!

1194
01:03:14,167 --> 01:03:16,250
That is…

1195
01:03:16,333 --> 01:03:18,708
[gasps] That's your glass, Miles.

1196
01:03:22,083 --> 01:03:23,292
[Miles] He…

1197
01:03:25,333 --> 01:03:26,750
He picked up mine.

1198
01:03:29,375 --> 01:03:32,333
He picked up mine.

1199
01:03:32,417 --> 01:03:33,333
He…

1200
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:36,792
Now we could…

1201
01:03:39,875 --> 01:03:40,708
Uh…

1202
01:03:41,333 --> 01:03:43,292
Oh, come on, Miles.

1203
01:03:43,375 --> 01:03:45,125
Miles, it's us!

1204
01:03:45,208 --> 01:03:46,750
Miles, baby, for real?

1205
01:03:47,542 --> 01:03:49,000
I'll pay you one billion dollars

1206
01:03:49,083 --> 01:03:50,833
to tell me
<font color="white">which one of them tried to kill me.

I'm just going to silence Duke's phone.

1210
01:03:57,667 --> 01:03:59,042
We're staying here in this room.

1211
01:03:59,125 --> 01:04:02,833
I'm keeping you all in plain sight
until that boat arrives.

1212
01:04:02,917 --> 01:04:05,333
- That's what we're doing.
- For God's sakes.

1213
01:04:05,417 --> 01:04:06,250
[scoffs]

1214
01:04:07,208 --> 01:04:10,042
Where's Whiskey? Where's Andi?

1215
01:04:10,125 --> 01:04:11,958
Where's Duke's phone?

1216
01:04:12,042 --> 01:04:14,625
It just dinged. It must be here.

1217
01:04:14,708 --> 01:04:16,042
[Lionel] Yeah, I saw it.

1218
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:17,750
We just heard it.

1219
01:04:18,375 --> 01:04:19,958
It isn't in any of his pockets.

1220
01:04:20,042 --> 01:04:23,708
Well, he must have dropped it somewhere.
Let's wait for it to ding again.

1221
01:04:23,792 --> 01:04:25,375
Forget about his phone. Look.

1222
01:04:29,708 --> 01:04:31,250
Where is his stupid gun?

1223
01:04:33,083 --> 01:04:37,250
Oh, fiddlesticks.
When did his gun disappear?

1224
01:04:37,333 --> 01:04:38,750
He always has his gun.

1225
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:42,417
Well, he always has it,
which means we stopped seeing it.

1226
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:44,583
But at some point this evening,
it was gone.

1227
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:47,625
- When was that?
- Andi.

1228
01:04:47,708 --> 01:04:49,208
We need to find Andi.

1229
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:50,583
[Miles] Andi!

1230
01:04:51,208 --> 01:04:52,500

Oh, shit. Shit.

1236
01:05:04,417 --> 01:05:06,958
- No. It's happening.
- Mr. Bron. What is the matter?

1237
01:05:07,042 --> 01:05:10,750
It was the game. The game! My murder game.
We were gonna be having drinks,

1238
01:05:10,833 --> 01:05:13,167
and I thought it'd be fun
to say something dramatic at 10:00.

1239
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:15,625
We were gonna have
20 minutes where… [gasps]

1240
01:05:15,708 --> 01:05:19,042
Blanc, you have to help me.
You have to help me. Help me! Help me!

1241
01:05:19,917 --> 01:05:21,625
What happens at ten o'clock?

- Is that you?
- [Peg] Stop screaming.

- [Benoit] Do not panic!

- [Birdie] I can't see.

It was Andi! [panting] It was Andi.

Will you explain it to us then, detective?

No, I can peel back the layers,

I can take it to a point,
but what lies at the center,

1306

only one person can tell us
who killed Cassandra Brand.

Well, why don't we start at the beginning?

My name is Helen Brand,

Okay, none of that really matters.

Mr. Blanc, two days ago,
I received a call.

<i>With the engine running.</i>

Do you know who she was?

Yes, of course. I'm sorry, you…
I thought you looked familiar. [chuckles]

since she was six years old.

1339
01:11:55,250 --> 01:11:56,667
You know what she called it?

1340
01:11:57,417 --> 01:12:02,292
"Notes For Future Biographers."
Biographers. Plural.

1341
01:12:02,375 --> 01:12:04,792
- The girl was six years old.
- [chuckles]

1342
01:12:04,875 --> 01:12:07,333
Then the day after high school,
she shot off to New York,

1343
01:12:07,417 --> 01:12:08,708
and she just never looked back.

1344
01:12:08,792 --> 01:12:10,792
[laughs] You know, when we were kids,

1345
01:12:10,875 --> 01:12:13,792
we goofed together,
and we'd do this character, Rich Bitch.

1346
01:12:15,417 --> 01:12:18,375
"Heavens, the dog ate the caviar again."

1347
01:12:19,125 --> 01:12:20,083
[chuckles]

1348
01:12:20,167 --> 01:12:22,917
Then I hear her doing a talk,
and that's exactly how she sounded.

1349
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,083
Rich Bitch! And I'm like,
"Who are you fooling, girl? Not me!"

1350
01:12:27,250 --> 01:12:29,417
She had the guts and brains
for both of us,

1351
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:31,625
and I was just happy watching her,
you know?

1352
01:12:32,292 --> 01:12:35,417
So you, um… You get the call…

1353
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:38,917
Yeah, yeah. I get the call and I fly in.
This was yesterday.

1354
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,958
And then I go to Andi's house.
I'm cleaning it out. It's a mess.

1355
01:12:43,042 --> 01:12:44,708
All of her books everywhere.

1356
01:12:44,792 --> 01:12:47,875
And I'm just thinking about
what was taken from my sister,

1357
01:12:47,958 --> 01:12:49,875
how I wasn't there for her.

1358
01:12:49,958 --> 01:12:53,625
And I'm getting angrier and angrier,
and then I just hear a knock at the door,

1359
01:12:53,708 --> 01:12:57,042
and it's some courier
with this thing from Miles Bron.

1360
01:12:57,583 --> 01:12:59,958
And I'm sure there's
some clever way to open it.

1361
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:02,000
I don't know. I just open it.

1362
01:13:02,083 --> 01:13:03,458
And it's an invitation

1363
01:13:03,958 --> 01:13:06,792
to his private island in Greece
for next weekend.

1364
01:13:06,875 --> 01:13:10,833
One of those little trips she'd go on
with him and his group of shitheads.

1365
01:13:10,917 --> 01:13:13,708
They like to call themselves
"The Disruptors."

1366
01:13:14,375 --> 01:13:19,083
But I knew who they were,
and I told her who they were. Shitheads.

1367
01:13:21,417 --> 01:13:22,333
[sighs]

1368
01:13:22,417 --> 01:13:26,208
Miss Brand, what can I do for you?

1369
01:13:27,333 --> 01:13:29,750
Andi didn't commit suicide.

1370
01:13:29,833 --> 01:13:30,917
[dramatic music plays]

1371
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,792
[Helen] She didn't leave any note.

1372
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:35,875
So I went on her computer,
and I looked in her email,

1373
01:13:35,958 --> 01:13:38,542
her sent messages,
to see if she wrote anybody anything.

1374
01:13:38,625 --> 01:13:44,167
And look. She sent this at 4:00 p.m.,
the day she was murdered, four days ago.

1375
01:13:45,167 --> 01:13:46,667
"I finally found it."

1376
01:13:46,750 --> 01:13:51,083
"It's right here, and I'm going to use it
to burn his whole empire down."

1377
01:13:51,167 --> 01:13:53,875
"I'm giving you all one last chance
to make things right."

1378
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,958
{\an8}"You know where to find me. A."

1379
01:13:58,958 --> 01:14:01,958
And I'm assuming
all of these names here are...

1380
01:14:02,042 --> 01:14:05,917
Birdie Jay, Duke Cody,
Claire Debella and Lionel Toussaint.

1381
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,125
The Shitheads.

1382
01:14:07,625 --> 01:14:10,542
She sends that email,
nobody writes back anything,

1383
01:14:10,625 --> 01:14:13,333
and then the next day,
she's dead in the garage

1384
01:14:13,417 --> 01:14:15,125
with sleeping pills in her system?

1385
01:14:16,417 --> 01:14:19,458
I searched every inch
of every room in her house,

1386
01:14:19,542 --> 01:14:21,292
and guess what wasn't there?

1387
01:14:23,917 --> 01:14:24,958
The red envelope.

1388
01:14:27,917 --> 01:14:28,917
Compelling.

1389
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:32,625
Google said you are
the world's greatest detective.

1390
01:14:32,708 --> 01:14:34,583
Somebody like me,
takes something like this

1391
01:14:34,667 --> 01:14:37,667
about a group of rich folk
with an army full of lawyers...

1392
01:14:37,750 --> 01:14:39,583
But if one was to get 'em alone,

1393
01:14:40,792 --> 01:14:44,667
isolated for a weekend with,
in your words,

1394
01:14:44,750 --> 01:14:47,000
the world's greatest detective…

1395
01:14:49,458 --> 01:14:51,375
You wanna hire me to go to that island.

1396
01:14:51,458 --> 01:14:53,042
It's a stupid idea, right?

1397
01:14:53,125 --> 01:14:55,167
Listen, I want to be clear, huh?

1398
01:14:55,917 --> 01:14:57,292
I am not Batman.

1399
01:14:57,375 --> 01:14:59,875
I can find you the truth,
I can gather evidence,

1400
01:14:59,958 --> 01:15:03,292
I can present it to the police
and the courts, but… [scoffs]

1401
01:15:03,375 --> 01:15:05,417
…that is where my jurisdiction ends.

1402
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:09,167
Yeah, but it's you doing it instead of me.
I'll take those odds.

1403
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:11,792
I've not seen
your sister's death in the news.

1404
01:15:11,875 --> 01:15:14,250
- Did you release a statement?
- [Helen] No.

1405
01:15:14,333 --> 01:15:15,833
Shit. Was I supposed to?

1406
01:15:16,875 --> 01:15:18,292
I don't know how this works.

1407
01:15:18,375 --> 01:15:21,833
And you have no other family member
who was informed of the death and…

1408
01:15:22,667 --> 01:15:25,250
Oh, if I pulled a few strings,

1409
01:15:25,333 --> 01:15:29,000
I could keep it from leaking
to the press for another… week?

1410
01:15:29,083 --> 01:15:30,583
Maybe, that's…

1411
01:15:31,833 --> 01:15:32,667
Oh.

1412
01:15:33,792 --> 01:15:35,875
No, that's outrageous. That wouldn't…

1413
01:15:38,042 --> 01:15:39,042
Well, now…

1414
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:44,000
Wow. No, that… Yes. Miss Brand.

1415
01:15:46,083 --> 01:15:50,042
Any feelings of reverence or respect
that you had for me

1416
01:15:50,125 --> 01:15:53,667
when you crossed my threshold,
buttress those feelings now.

1417
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:54,625
Buttress them.

1418
01:15:56,292 --> 01:16:02,083
I am proposing
that you come with me to that island

1419
01:16:03,167 --> 01:16:04,333
as your sister.

1420
01:16:05,417 --> 01:16:07,125
As Cassandra Brand.

1421
01:16:08,167 --> 01:16:12,458
What? No.
<font color="white">No, no, no, I'm hiring you to go.

1422
01:16:13,417 --> 01:16:15,958
I… I'm not… Are you insane?

1423
01:16:16,042 --> 01:16:17,667
Buttress now. Yes.

1424
01:16:17,750 --> 01:16:19,583
A famous detective shows up

1425
01:16:19,667 --> 01:16:23,083
and out of the blue,
starts poking the subject of your sister,

1426
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:24,833
they'll shut up like a clam.

1427
01:16:25,875 --> 01:16:30,542
Your presence on that island
is the essential catalyst.

1428
01:16:30,625 --> 01:16:32,625
- Oh, no, come on, man.
- Buttress.

1429
01:16:32,708 --> 01:16:36,000
Yeah, I'm trying real hard to buttress,
but this sounds nuts.

1430
01:16:36,083 --> 01:16:38,250
But it is the only way that this works.

1431
01:16:38,333 --> 01:16:41,750
Look at me.
<font color="white">They'll know instantly that I'm not her.

1432
01:16:41,833 --> 01:16:44,083
You'll cut your hair.
You'll wear her clothes.

1433
01:16:44,167 --> 01:16:46,417
Oh, you really think
I can fit into that shit?

1434
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:49,042
- And what about my hair?
- I know a guy.

1435
01:16:49,125 --> 01:16:51,333
Now, why would anyone suspect

1436
01:16:51,417 --> 01:16:55,625
you showing up, playing your sister,
when they don't know your sister is dead?

1437
01:16:58,792 --> 01:16:59,667
[Helen] Right.

1438
01:17:00,250 --> 01:17:01,917
They don't know Andi is dead.

1439
01:17:03,542 --> 01:17:05,333
So why would they suspect anything?

1440
01:17:07,208 --> 01:17:11,375
- And you'll do the inspecting?
- Yes, I will. You just have to be there.

1441
01:17:13,083 --> 01:17:16,958
Mr. Blanc, is… Is this safe?

1442
01:17:19,167 --> 01:17:20,083
No. No.

1443
01:17:21,167 --> 01:17:23,625
One person will know the truth about you.

1444
01:17:24,375 --> 01:17:26,083
From the moment you arrive on that island,

1445
01:17:26,167 --> 01:17:28,917
the killer will know who you are
and what you are doing.

1446
01:17:29,417 --> 01:17:32,458
And they certainly wouldn't hesitate
to kill again if it covers their tracks.

1447
01:17:32,542 --> 01:17:36,708
I'm… I'm a detective, Helen.
I'm not a bodyguard.

1448
01:17:37,542 --> 01:17:40,042
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

1449
01:17:41,292 --> 01:17:42,250
No.

1450
01:17:44,583 --> 01:17:48,125
One of those shitheads killed my sister.

1451
01:17:53,458 --> 01:17:56,167
Do you really think
we can get the son of a bitch?

1452
01:17:56,250 --> 01:17:57,750
[suspenseful music playing]

1453
01:18:00,542 --> 01:18:02,083
[music continues]

1454
01:18:24,542 --> 01:18:25,750
Well, my goodness.

1455
01:18:25,833 --> 01:18:30,750
I shouldn't be here. This is nuts.
But I'm here. So let's do this.

1456
01:18:31,792 --> 01:18:34,000
- Drink?
<font color="white">- You need a drink.

1457
01:18:34,083 --> 01:18:36,000
Oh, no, I don't drink.
I'll have some coffee.

1458
01:18:36,083 --> 01:18:37,042
[waiter] All right.

1459
01:18:37,542 --> 01:18:38,500
Andi's journals.

1460
01:18:38,583 --> 01:18:42,375
Good, you keep studying them.
Okay, so… Tomorrow.

1461
01:18:42,958 --> 01:18:44,125
I'll get there early.

1462
01:18:44,208 --> 01:18:47,542
Really lay on some Southern hokum,
get them all off guard.

1463
01:18:47,625 --> 01:18:50,167
On the boat… be cold.

1464
01:18:50,250 --> 01:18:51,458
Don't engage in conversation.

1465
01:18:51,542 --> 01:18:53,583
- Okay, I'm not great on boats.
- Oh, you'll be fine.

1466
01:18:53,667 --> 01:18:57,083
Just remember, Rich Bitch voice.
Andi posture.

1467
01:18:58,208 --> 01:19:00,667
I have all of her TED Talks on this,
and I've been studying 'em.

1468
01:19:00,750 --> 01:19:01,917
Good.

1469
01:19:03,042 --> 01:19:05,958
- [in stately tone] The dog ate the caviar.
- There you go.

1470
01:19:06,542 --> 01:19:07,375
Yeah.

1471
01:19:07,458 --> 01:19:08,958
[in Southern accent] So, you said

1472
01:19:09,042 --> 01:19:11,042
you were gonna be researching
these folks for motive.

1473
01:19:11,125 --> 01:19:12,333
Did you find anything?

1474
01:19:12,417 --> 01:19:13,625
Yes, I did.

1475
01:19:13,708 --> 01:19:17,167
But motives for each of them
to want Miles Bron dead.

1476
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:20,083
Now why would they
kill her to protect him?

1477
01:19:20,167 --> 01:19:21,375
I just don't get it.

1478
01:19:21,458 --> 01:19:24,167
What about Miles? What if he just did it?

1479
01:19:24,250 --> 01:19:28,375
Well, we can't rule it out,
but Miles Bron is not an idiot.

1480
01:19:29,125 --> 01:19:32,375
To risk committing murder
after a very public court case,

1481
01:19:32,458 --> 01:19:35,083
with the possibility
of that email of Andi's coming to light,

1482
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:37,917
would be an exceedingly
stupid thing to do.

1483
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,292
Especially if someone
was willing to do it for him.

1484
01:19:40,375 --> 01:19:42,417
Come on. Walk me through these journals.

1485
01:19:43,083 --> 01:19:44,000
Okay.

1486
01:19:44,542 --> 01:19:47,208
About ten years ago,
before they all hit it big,

1487
01:19:47,292 --> 01:19:48,833
<i>they used to hang together at this bar.</i>

1488
01:19:48,917 --> 01:19:50,875
[Benoit] <i><font color="white">And Miles was leader of the pack?</i>

1489
01:19:50,958 --> 01:19:52,167
[Helen] <i><font color="white">No. Andi was.</i>

1490
01:19:52,250 --> 01:19:54,250
<i>They were all friends with Andi.</i>

1491
01:19:54,833 --> 01:19:56,625
<i>Birdie was a washed-up model.</i>

1492
01:19:56,708 --> 01:20:00,000
<i>Duke was a nerd
doing video game tournaments.</i>

1493
01:20:00,083 --> 01:20:02,167
<i>Claire just lost a race for city council.</i>

1494
01:20:02,250 --> 01:20:04,292
<i>Lionel was a substitute teacher.</i>

1495
01:20:04,375 --> 01:20:06,542
<i>All of them run aground in their thirties.</i>

1496
01:20:06,625 --> 01:20:09,500
<i>But Andi saw their potentials.
She found them all.</i>

1497
01:20:09,583 --> 01:20:10,583
- Hi!
<font color="white">- Hey!

1498
01:20:10,667 --> 01:20:13,333
[Helen] <i><font color="white">Then she found Miles.</i>
<i>Introduced him to the group.</i>

1499
01:20:13,417 --> 01:20:14,958
This is Miles.

1500
01:20:15,042 --> 01:20:16,708
- Hey, nice to meet you.
- Hey, bro.

1501
01:20:16,792 --> 01:20:17,833
[Claire] I love your hair.

1502
01:20:17,917 --> 01:20:19,667
[Helen] <i><font color="white">At first, nobody liked him.</i>

1503
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:20,917
[Miles] …outlive the person…

1504
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,125
[Helen] <i><font color="white">He'd say stuff like…</i>

1505
01:20:22,208 --> 01:20:24,458
I want to be responsible for something

1506
01:20:24,542 --> 01:20:28,292
that gets talked about in the same breath
as the <i><font color="white">Mona Lisa.</i> Forever.

1507
01:20:28,375 --> 01:20:30,708
What does that even mean?

1508
01:20:30,792 --> 01:20:32,292
It just means immortality.

1509
01:20:32,375 --> 01:20:35,125
He wants to create something
that feels lasting, that feels...

1510
01:20:35,208 --> 01:20:37,792
His first venture was Moviefone
for foot massages.

1511
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:39,667
- Did it work?
- [Lionel] No!

1512
01:20:39,750 --> 01:20:41,583
Okay, listen, let's just roll with it.

1513
01:20:41,667 --> 01:20:44,333
Let's humor him. Let's see where it goes.
Let's see what happens.

1514
01:20:44,417 --> 01:20:46,875
- Hey, team.
<i>- </font></i><font color="white">[Helen] <i>And things started happening.</i>

1515
01:20:46,958 --> 01:20:48,625
[screams]

1516
01:20:48,708 --> 01:20:51,667
[Helen] <i><font color="white">He got Birdie a show</i>

1517
01:20:51,750 --> 01:20:55,042

Duke set up at Twitch.</i>

1518
01:20:55,125 --> 01:20:56,750
<i>Claire elected locally.</i>

1519
01:20:56,833 --> 01:20:58,250
…at you. I love you back!

[Helen] <i><font color="white">You know, small stuff,</i>
<i>but it happened.</i>

1521
01:21:02,375 --> 01:21:04,375
{\an8}<i>And then the big thing happened.</i>

1522
01:21:05,958 --> 01:21:07,250
What is that you're working on?

1523
01:21:07,833 --> 01:21:08,958
<i>♪ He told me ♪</i>

1524
01:21:09,042 --> 01:21:11,250
<i>♪ Let the children lose it ♪</i>

1525
01:21:11,333 --> 01:21:13,458
<i>♪ Let the children use it ♪</i>

1526
01:21:13,542 --> 01:21:15,417
<i>♪ Let all the children boogie ♪</i>

1527
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:18,917
So based on the napkin idea,
Andi and Miles created Alpha.

1528
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,375
It blows up.
They bring everyone along for the ride.

1529
01:21:22,375 --> 01:21:24,625
Miles' aspirations
keep getting bigger and bigger.

1530
01:21:24,708 --> 01:21:25,917
Cut to two years ago,

1531
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,167
Miles meets
<font color="white">some sketchy Norwegian scientist

1532
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:30,583
at an ayahuasca ceremony in Peru

1533
01:21:30,667 --> 01:21:33,167
who sells him
on this whole new hydrogen fuel.

1534
01:21:33,250 --> 01:21:36,542
- Hmm.
<font color="white">- He becomes obsessed.

1535
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:40,583
And he's willing to give the company's
entire resources to launch this thing.

1536
01:21:42,042 --> 01:21:43,042
No.

1537
01:21:43,125 --> 01:21:46,667
Andi. Andi, come on. This is it!

1538
01:21:46,750 --> 01:21:50,583
No, no, no. This is not a start-up.
This could blow up the world.

1539
01:21:50,667 --> 01:21:51,500
Yeah.

1540
01:21:51,583 --> 01:21:54,417
No! Literally, Miles.
This could blow up the world!

1541
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:55,333
[sighs]

1542
01:21:55,417 --> 01:22:00,583
The reality-distortion field ends here.
I can't let you do this.

1543
01:22:01,458 --> 01:22:04,208
What… What do you mean you can't let me?

1544
01:22:04,792 --> 01:22:05,750
I'll walk.

1545
01:22:06,333 --> 01:22:09,750
And I'll take half the company
to stop you from using it for this.

1546
01:22:09,833 --> 01:22:13,167
And she did it.
And, God, I love that she did it.

1547
01:22:13,917 --> 01:22:16,750
Then she found out Miles
had the lawyers work the contract

1548
01:22:16,833 --> 01:22:18,542
so she was cut out the company completely.

1549
01:22:18,625 --> 01:22:20,375
So she sued over that?

1550
01:22:20,458 --> 01:22:21,833
Her whole case was based on

1551
01:22:21,917 --> 01:22:25,250
intellectual ownership
of the company's founding idea.

1552
01:22:25,833 --> 01:22:27,250
Her idea on the napkin.

1553
01:22:28,083 --> 01:22:29,750
Which she didn't keep.

1554
01:22:29,833 --> 01:22:33,667
Miles was very excited. He had an idea.

1555
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:35,625
Uh, so he grabbed a napkin,

1556
01:22:35,708 --> 01:22:40,208
and he, uh, he scribbled
something on it to show us.

1557
01:22:40,292 --> 01:22:44,167
- That's a lie! Your Honor, it's a lie.
- [judge] Order! Counsel, get your client...

1558
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:46,958
[Andi] Look me in the eye, Claire!
You know it's a lie!

1559
01:22:47,625 --> 01:22:48,708
It's a lie.

1560
01:22:48,792 --> 01:22:49,875
[camera shutters clicking]

1561
01:22:49,958 --> 01:22:53,667
[lawyer] And do you recall, Mr. Cody,
who wrote this napkin?

1562
01:22:53,750 --> 01:22:54,833
Yeah, Miles.

1563
01:22:55,542 --> 01:22:57,583
Uh, it was Miles.

1564
01:22:59,208 --> 01:23:00,083
Miles.

1565
01:23:03,333 --> 01:23:04,292
[Helen] <i><font color="white">This was March.</i>

1566
01:23:05,750 --> 01:23:07,250
<i>And right after the verdict,</i>

1567
01:23:07,333 --> 01:23:10,542
<i>Miles suddenly found the napkin
written in his handwriting</i>

1568
01:23:10,625 --> 01:23:12,958
<i>and did all those interviews about it.</i>

1569

[Benoit] <i><font color="white">A bald-faced fabrication.</i>

1570
01:23:15,125 --> 01:23:19,083
A damn lie, and it worked.

[dramatic music playing]

1572
01:23:22,042 --> 01:23:23,125
[grunts]

1573
01:23:54,708 --> 01:23:59,333
So… every one of The Disruptors
perjured themselves

1574
01:23:59,417 --> 01:24:02,375
to destroy Andi and shield Miles Bron.

1575
01:24:02,458 --> 01:24:06,667
We… You and I,
we need to find out why. Motive.

1576
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:10,458
Whose was strong enough
to go one step further and commit murder?

1577
01:24:10,542 --> 01:24:12,250
And then, this will be tricky,

1578
01:24:12,333 --> 01:24:15,625
everyone's whereabouts
on the night of her death.

1579
01:24:15,708 --> 01:24:19,667
Who could have been
at Andi's house that night? Opportunity.

1580
01:24:20,625 --> 01:24:24,083
- Our suspects, motive, opportunity… Hey!
- Mm-hmm.

1581
01:24:25,042 --> 01:24:27,500
- This kinda looks like that <i>Clue</font></i><font color="white"> notepad.
- Yes, yes, yes.

1582
01:24:27,583 --> 01:24:29,125
You must be really great at <i>Clue,</i><font color="white"> huh?

1583
01:24:29,208 --> 01:24:32,458
I'm very bad at dumb things.
My Achilles' heel.

1584
01:24:32,542 --> 01:24:35,542
Ticking boxes, running around,
searching all the rooms.

1585
01:24:35,625 --> 01:24:37,375
It's just a terrible, terrible game.

1586
01:24:37,458 --> 01:24:39,667
Well, my students love it.

1587
01:24:44,917 --> 01:24:45,792
I'm scared.

1588
01:24:48,792 --> 01:24:49,875
I understand.

1589
01:24:53,250 --> 01:24:55,125
This is your last chance to back out.

1590
01:25:04,958 --> 01:25:06,750
[dramatic music playing]

1591
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:15,375
[grunts softly]

1592
01:25:15,458 --> 01:25:18,792
Oh, God. Boats.

1593
01:25:20,375 --> 01:25:21,458
[Duke whistles]

1594
01:25:23,917 --> 01:25:25,000
Ballsy move.

1595
01:25:26,042 --> 01:25:27,625
[Birdie] You shouldn't be here.

1596
01:25:36,583 --> 01:25:40,917
Duke and Birdie, I think they're onto me.
Or they were just being assholes.

1597
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,583
Well, that's not mutually exclusive.

1598
01:25:42,667 --> 01:25:45,042
Now, look, I suspect,
when we're all settling in,

1599
01:25:45,125 --> 01:25:47,917
Bron's going to pull me aside
to explain my presence.

1600
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,958
That is your chance to snoop.

1601
01:25:50,042 --> 01:25:50,875
Snoop?

1602
01:25:51,917 --> 01:25:52,917
Snoop.

1603
01:25:55,708 --> 01:25:56,833
[suspenseful music playing]

1604
01:25:56,917 --> 01:25:59,167
Snooping. Snoop.

1605
01:26:00,792 --> 01:26:02,792
Okay, here we go.

1606
01:26:13,875 --> 01:26:16,167
- [Whiskey] Hey.
- [Helen, in stately tone] Hi.

1607
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:17,125
Andi.

1608
01:26:18,375 --> 01:26:19,333
Yes.

1609
01:26:19,417 --> 01:26:21,833
I'm Whiskey. We didn't really meet.

1610
01:26:22,917 --> 01:26:25,792
- Are you looking for the pool?
- I am.

1611
01:26:25,875 --> 01:26:28,000
- Do you want to walk?
- Sure.

1612
01:26:28,083 --> 01:26:31,292
Do you want this? I'm not into it.
It smells like that guy Derol.

1613
01:26:32,167 --> 01:26:34,958
That's a beautiful necklace.
You're a Taurus?

1614
01:26:35,042 --> 01:26:37,333
Yeah. Um, Miles got it for me.

1615
01:26:38,583 --> 01:26:41,958
He, um, surprised me for my birthday.

1616
01:26:42,042 --> 01:26:44,750
He filled his entire
penthouse apartment with roses.

1617
01:26:44,833 --> 01:26:45,958
It was very cute.

1618
01:26:47,375 --> 01:26:50,458
He's a really good guy. He's complicated.

1619
01:26:51,750 --> 01:26:52,875
But…

1620
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:57,000
I think it's really shitty
what they all did to you.

1621
01:26:57,875 --> 01:26:59,333
And how they all treated you.

1622
01:26:59,417 --> 01:27:01,875
I read your court transcripts,
and you got shanked.

1623
01:27:04,625 --> 01:27:06,042
Thanks, Whiskey.

1624
01:27:06,125 --> 01:27:08,083
Yeah, this is my second one
of these things.

1625
01:27:08,167 --> 01:27:09,458
We did a yacht thing last year.

1626
01:27:09,542 --> 01:27:11,167
Well, that sounds fun.

1627
01:27:11,708 --> 01:27:13,167
[laughs] No.

1628
01:27:13,958 --> 01:27:16,792
I mean, when they're all together,
it's kind of the worst.

1629
01:27:17,292 --> 01:27:20,208
Duke just treats me like arm candy,
and they just ignore me.

1630
01:27:20,292 --> 01:27:22,333
- Why do you put up with it?
- With Duke?

1631
01:27:23,958 --> 01:27:28,208
I'm building my brand, and he's putting me
on his channel more often.

1632
01:27:29,375 --> 01:27:32,750
Though, he's leaning harder right
into this mandom stuff.

1633
01:27:32,833 --> 01:27:35,000
If I'm going to go
into politics eventually,

1634
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:37,667
I don't think
that's a road I wanna go down.

1635
01:27:37,750 --> 01:27:40,500
It's expeditious,
but it's kind of a shitshow.

1636
01:27:41,750 --> 01:27:45,042
- Oh, here's the pool.
- I'm gonna walk around a little longer.

1637
01:27:45,125 --> 01:27:46,625
- I'll catch you over there.
- Okay.

1638
01:27:46,708 --> 01:27:49,042
Hey, it's really great
talking to you, Whiskey.

1639
01:27:49,125 --> 01:27:50,042
You too.

1640
01:27:55,708 --> 01:27:58,875
- [male voice over speakers] <i>Dong!</i>

1643

Asshole.

- [Miles] Now it's a party.
- [grunts]

1645
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:10,583
I did it. Two weeks ago, I did it.

1646
01:28:11,833 --> 01:28:13,500
You signed off on the power plant.

1647
01:28:13,583 --> 01:28:16,458
Yep. When this thing breaks, poof.

1648
01:28:16,542 --> 01:28:20,375
My whole base is gone.
The grassroots lefties? Gone.

1649
01:28:20,458 --> 01:28:21,833
I did it too.

1650
01:28:21,917 --> 01:28:22,875
Did what?

1651
01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:26,208
I signed off on putting Klear
in a manned mission.

1652
01:28:26,292 --> 01:28:28,625
- The staff doesn't know it yet.
- [Claire] Oh, God damn it.

1653
01:28:29,583 --> 01:28:32,500
Let's just pray that
Andi was wrong about this Klear stuff.

1654
01:28:32,583 --> 01:28:34,042
No, she was right.

1655
01:28:34,125 --> 01:28:37,333
You put its gas form
into household piping,

1656
01:28:37,417 --> 01:28:40,292
there's massive leakage into the air.
The hydrogen particles are too small.

1657
01:28:40,375 --> 01:28:41,500
Hydrogen gas?

1658
01:28:42,750 --> 01:28:44,417
Lionel. I sold my soul for this.

1659
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:50,458
You're telling me that it could literally
turn people's homes into the Hindenburg?

1660
01:28:54,292 --> 01:28:57,000
I will take care of him. Don't worry.

1661
01:29:02,583 --> 01:29:04,542
There was a time, you know, back when…

1662
01:29:06,125 --> 01:29:08,458
I was the one on magazines. He was nobody.

1663
01:29:09,292 --> 01:29:11,667
He was this little thing in my hand.

1664
01:29:12,958 --> 01:29:14,292
I preferred that.

1665
01:29:20,083 --> 01:29:22,208
Andi! Hi!

1666
01:29:25,167 --> 01:29:28,958
Wow! No.
<font color="white">[chuckles] You're really good at this.

1667
01:29:29,042 --> 01:29:33,375
This is interesting stuff about Whiskey
and motives for both Lionel and Claire.

1668
01:29:33,458 --> 01:29:34,458
Well done!

1669
01:29:34,542 --> 01:29:37,167
Those were motives?
Because I was kind of confused.

1670
01:29:37,250 --> 01:29:39,833
Oh, no, they bet the farm
and will both be ruined

1671
01:29:39,917 --> 01:29:41,750
along with Miles if he fails.

1672
01:29:41,833 --> 01:29:44,250
They need to protect him at all costs.

1673
01:29:44,333 --> 01:29:46,833
But I can't imagine them killing her.
I just can't.

1674
01:29:46,917 --> 01:29:50,500
Think of the crime, the nature of it.

1675
01:29:51,792 --> 01:29:55,500
<i>No, they've come to apologize,
to make amends.</i>

1676
01:29:56,458 --> 01:29:59,750
<i>And the murder itself, it's nonviolent.</i>

1677
01:30:00,708 --> 01:30:01,917
<i>Gentle even.</i>

1678
01:30:04,625 --> 01:30:06,833
<i>They don't even see her die.</i>

1679
01:30:06,917 --> 01:30:07,750
[engine starts]

1680
01:30:08,375 --> 01:30:10,292
[Benoit] <i><font color="white">She just goes to sleep.</i>

1681
01:30:13,958 --> 01:30:15,250
No. No.

1682
01:30:15,958 --> 01:30:18,000
They're all more than capable.

1683
01:30:19,875 --> 01:30:21,542
[Helen gulping]

1684
01:30:22,625 --> 01:30:24,417
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1685
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:26,333
I thought you said you didn't drink?

1686
01:30:26,417 --> 01:30:29,875
Oh, this? This isn't a drink.
This is some funky health stuff.

1687
01:30:29,958 --> 01:30:31,917
No, you give me that.

1688
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:36,833
That's hard kombucha.
That's Jared Leto's hard kombucha.

1689
01:30:36,917 --> 01:30:39,417
What is it that? That's 9% alcohol or so…

1690
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:41,417
Get off that.
How many of these things you had?

1691
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:44,083
I don't know, but I feel fine.

1692
01:30:44,833 --> 01:30:46,417
Okay? We need to focus.

1693
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:49,917
We need to focus. We need
to find the O's, the opportunities.

1694
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,125
We got to open them up. It's time to push.

1695
01:30:52,208 --> 01:30:54,750
No, no, no.
<font color="white">We're not pushing anything right now.

1696
01:30:54,833 --> 01:30:56,833
Listen, I feel good.

1697
01:30:56,917 --> 01:30:58,333
I think maybe you should lie down.

1698
01:30:58,417 --> 01:31:00,375
- We're running out of time, Blanc!
- Helen!

1699
01:31:01,083 --> 01:31:02,083
[softly] Helen…

1700
01:31:03,208 --> 01:31:04,292
Please.

1701
01:31:04,375 --> 01:31:05,917
Think of the danger here.

1702
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:08,458
You gotta step back
and let me handle this.

1703
01:31:09,167 --> 01:31:10,208
Push nothing.

1704
01:31:14,125 --> 01:31:15,833
[Miles] <i><font color="white">They're gonna tell you to stop.</i>

1705
01:31:16,417 --> 01:31:19,833
Even your partner will say,
"You need to stop."

1706
01:31:20,458 --> 01:31:22,458
Because as it turns out,

1707
01:31:22,542 --> 01:31:26,167
nobody wants you to break
the system itself.

1708
01:31:26,917 --> 01:31:29,958
But that is what true disruption is.

1709
01:31:30,625 --> 01:31:34,208
And that is what unites all of us.

1710
01:31:34,292 --> 01:31:37,125
We all got to that line and crossed it.

1711
01:31:40,833 --> 01:31:41,792
[Claire] Andi…

1712
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:45,333
Wait! Wait.

1713
01:31:46,667 --> 01:31:49,542
Wait? No, you wait!

1714
01:31:50,458 --> 01:31:53,208
That day in court,
you couldn't even look me in the eye.

1715
01:31:55,708 --> 01:31:57,000
What are you doing?

1716
01:32:05,250 --> 01:32:07,000
You want to talk about the email?

1717
01:32:07,083 --> 01:32:07,917
Oh.

1718
01:32:08,542 --> 01:32:12,958
So now you want to talk about the email?
You didn't even write back.

1719
01:32:13,708 --> 01:32:15,458
I'm a politician.

1720
01:32:15,542 --> 01:32:17,042
I never email anything

1721
01:32:17,125 --> 01:32:20,208
that I wouldn't want to see
on the front page of <i>The Times.</i>

1722
01:32:20,292 --> 01:32:21,583
That's why I called.

1723
01:32:21,667 --> 01:32:22,500
[scoffs]

1724
01:32:23,292 --> 01:32:26,667
We all did.
<font color="white">Right after we got it, over and over.

1725
01:32:27,167 --> 01:32:30,750
You… Your phone was off,
and then the whole next week.

1726
01:32:31,708 --> 01:32:32,875
Yeah, I've got a new number.

1727
01:32:33,750 --> 01:32:37,167
And when we couldn't reach you,
I went to your house.

1728
01:32:37,917 --> 01:32:40,125
[Claire] <i><font color="white">Lionel and I got there</i>
<i>at the same time.</i>

1729
01:32:40,208 --> 01:32:41,458
<i>Duke was already there.</i>

1730
01:32:41,542 --> 01:32:43,250
- [Duke] Andi!
- [Lionel] Hey, Andi?

1731
01:32:43,333 --> 01:32:44,375
[Duke] <i><font color="white">The lights were out.</i>

1732
01:32:44,458 --> 01:32:46,458
<i>I was pounding so hard,
I almost broke it down.</i>

1733
01:32:46,542 --> 01:32:47,375
Andi!

1734
01:32:49,292 --> 01:32:52,167
We knocked, waited, and called for you,
but after an hour, we left.

1735
01:32:52,250 --> 01:32:55,042
Birdie came back later on to check.
It was the same thing.

1736
01:32:55,125 --> 01:32:58,125
- Where the hell were you, Andi?
- What time did you get there?

1737
01:32:58,708 --> 01:33:00,167
I don't know. It was dark.

1738
01:33:01,667 --> 01:33:02,500
And, Duke,

1739
01:33:03,708 --> 01:33:05,167
you were already there?

1740
01:33:05,250 --> 01:33:07,333
He almost got in an accident
on his motorcycle,

1741
01:33:07,417 --> 01:33:08,542
he was driving so fast.

1742
01:33:08,625 --> 01:33:09,875
Andi, I almost got pancaked.

1743
01:33:09,958 --> 01:33:13,208
Okay, okay. Can you say all that
one more time for me, please?

1744
01:33:14,750 --> 01:33:15,583
[sighs]

1745
01:33:17,125 --> 01:33:17,958
Look.

1746
01:33:19,292 --> 01:33:22,083
I don't know what you're planning
on pulling being here,

1747
01:33:22,750 --> 01:33:24,500
but we need to talk about this.

1748
01:33:25,583 --> 01:33:27,750
If I would've answered
the door that night,

1749
01:33:28,875 --> 01:33:32,333
would you have said,
"I'm sorry. I back you with Miles."

1750
01:33:33,667 --> 01:33:35,625
Or were you just showing up

1751
01:33:35,708 --> 01:33:38,250
so you could stop me
from using that envelope?

1752
01:33:53,083 --> 01:33:54,208
Something's off.

1753
01:33:55,042 --> 01:33:56,167
I don't like it.

1754
01:33:57,208 --> 01:33:58,583
What's she playing at?

1755
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:02,500
[alarm blaring]

1756
01:34:02,583 --> 01:34:05,208

<i>Please, keep our water clean. Please…</i>

1757
01:34:05,292 --> 01:34:06,292
[Helen] Blanc!

1758
01:34:06,833 --> 01:34:08,917
[automated voice]
<i>Please, keep our water clean.</i>

1759
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,583
That's everything she said, I think.

1760
01:34:11,667 --> 01:34:14,875
I think maybe you should take up drinking.
You're just killing it.

1761
01:34:14,958 --> 01:34:20,250
Lionel and Claire were never there alone.
But Duke came early and Birdie came late.

1762
01:34:20,333 --> 01:34:22,792
But they could've gotten there early,
killed your sister,

1763
01:34:22,875 --> 01:34:25,917
{\an8}circled away and then waited
for the other to arrive.

1764
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,167
{\an8}Shit.

1765
01:34:28,250 --> 01:34:30,583
{\an8}Something is just teasing the edge
of my brain.

1766
01:34:30,667 --> 01:34:33,792
{\an8}This… this case confounds me.
It just confounds me.

1767
01:34:33,875 --> 01:34:37,333
{\an8}We don't have a motive
for Duke or Birdie, so...

1768
01:34:37,417 --> 01:34:39,958
{\an8}<i>Do either of you two
want to do a session or what?</i>

1769

<i>I'm on the clock.</i>

1770
01:34:44,208 --> 01:34:46,708
No, not right now.

1771

[fax machine whirring]

1772
01:34:49,542 --> 01:34:50,542
Maybe later.

1773
01:34:50,625 --> 01:34:52,500
<i>All right. It's your money, not mine.</i>

1774
01:34:57,250 --> 01:35:03,333
Ugh. Oh, if I ever meet Jared Leto,
I'm gonna whoop his kombucha-brewing ass.

1775
01:35:03,417 --> 01:35:06,042
One number. All his machines.

1776
01:35:09,458 --> 01:35:10,625
[Helen] Holy shit.

1777
01:35:10,708 --> 01:35:14,375
From that afternoon,
just minutes after Andi sent the email.

1778
01:35:15,042 --> 01:35:16,875
Lionel. Lionel faxed it...

1779
01:35:16,958 --> 01:35:19,667
Now hold on,
it doesn't necessarily mean he… Get down.

1780
01:35:20,292 --> 01:35:22,958
Right now. Go to him.
Do what you gotta do,

1781
01:35:23,042 --> 01:35:26,125
push that son of a bitch.
Just get an answer out of him.

1782
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:31,750
Look, babe. We really need this.
So do this for me one last time, okay?

1783
01:35:33,333 --> 01:35:35,583
- All right. I love...

1791
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:14,333
Not that.

- Hmm?
<font color="white">- Huh-uh.

Oh, come on, come on.

1794
01:36:18,083 --> 01:36:20,042
It's all he wants.

1795
01:36:20,125 --> 01:36:22,625
The YouTube channel's dying.
He needs the exposure.

1796
01:36:22,708 --> 01:36:26,958
Just put him on Alpha News, baby.
Just a late-night spot.

1797
01:36:27,042 --> 01:36:30,208
And you know he's earned it.
With what he did.

1798
01:36:30,292 --> 01:36:31,500
[Miles] Listen, listen.

1799
01:36:31,583 --> 01:36:33,875
I am building the future of news.

- See? See?

1802

Like, he is my loyal friend,
but I can't put him on Alpha News. Okay?

An email from the Sweetie Pants contractor
two years ago.

"Miss Jay, I'm writing to inform you
that the proposed Bangladesh factory

"Sounds perfect. Thanks."

please tell me you did not think
sweatshops are where they make

1835
01:38:30,167 --> 01:38:32,208
Oh my God.

1836
01:38:32,292 --> 01:38:34,667
[sighs] Miles is going to pay me off.

1837
01:38:34,750 --> 01:38:37,333
He said if I take full responsibility
for the sweatshops,

1838
01:38:37,417 --> 01:38:39,667
he'll pay me the value of my shares.

1839

Thirty million.

1840
01:38:41,625 --> 01:38:44,042
I will do whatever I have to do
to save myself,

1841
01:38:44,125 --> 01:38:46,500

That's because it's a terrible game.

They all had a motive to protect Miles.

1846

They were all there that night.
So what now, detective?

1847
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:01,833
The envelope.

1848
01:39:02,833 --> 01:39:06,708
Whoever killed your sister
took that envelope to protect Miles,

1849
01:39:06,792 --> 01:39:08,500
and they wouldn't just destroy it.

1850
01:39:08,583 --> 01:39:10,917

So how are we supposed to find it?

1853
01:39:16,333 --> 01:39:18,792
Well, unless someone brings
an attaché case to dinner,

1854
01:39:18,875 --> 01:39:21,958
they won't have an envelope
that size on their person.

1855
01:39:24,667 --> 01:39:26,583

01:49:09,833 --> 01:49:11,875
That is the Aegean Sea.

2000
01:49:11,958 --> 01:49:15,042
Oh, yeah, it is. It is.

2001
01:49:15,125 --> 01:49:20,250
His dock doesn't float.
His wonder-fuel is a disaster.

2002
01:49:20,333 --> 01:49:24,000
His grasp of disruption theory
is remedial at best.

2003
01:49:24,083 --> 01:49:27,208
He didn't design the puzzle boxes.
He didn't write the mystery.

2004
01:49:27,292 --> 01:49:32,292
<i>Et voilà!</i><font color="white"> It all adds up.
The key to this entire case.

2005
01:49:33,125 --> 01:49:35,125
And it was staring me right in the face.

2006
01:49:36,458 --> 01:49:38,792
Like everyone in the world,

2007
01:49:38,875 --> 01:49:43,042
I assumed Miles Bron was
a complicated genius.

2008
01:49:43,125 --> 01:49:44,292
But why?

2009
01:49:45,833 --> 01:49:49,875
Look into the clear center
of this Glass Onion…

2010
01:49:52,542 --> 01:49:54,292
Miles Bron is an idiot.

2011
01:49:56,125 --> 01:50:01,542
Oh, please.
<font color="white">Just tell us who tried to kill me.

2012
01:50:01,625 --> 01:50:06,417
Nobody tried to kill you,
you vainglorious buffoon.

2013
01:50:06,500 --> 01:50:09,083
Duke took my glass!

2014
01:50:09,167 --> 01:50:11,042
That's what you told us he did.

2015
01:50:11,958 --> 01:50:15,625
He must've picked it up by mistake,
you told us, right after it happened.

2016
01:50:15,708 --> 01:50:19,292
Look at that dress spin.
Birdie, do that again. Watch this.

2017
01:50:19,375 --> 01:50:21,333
And after you said those words,

2018
01:50:21,417 --> 01:50:24,292
that's what we all remember seeing,
but think!

2019
01:50:25,625 --> 01:50:29,292
Ignore his lies, everyone,
and think clearly now.

2020
01:50:29,375 --> 01:50:32,292
What did we all actually see?

2021
01:50:32,375 --> 01:50:35,208
Wow! Look at that dress spin.
Birdie, that's amazing.

2022
01:50:35,292 --> 01:50:36,333
Just…

2023
01:50:36,417 --> 01:50:40,417
- [gasps]
<font color="white">- [Benoit] You handed Duke your own glass.

2024
01:50:40,500 --> 01:50:42,875
Clear as crystal.
Right in front of our eyes.

2025
01:50:42,958 --> 01:50:46,667
All of us.
<font color="white">And then told a bald-faced fabrication.

2026
01:50:47,458 --> 01:50:48,625
And it worked.

2027
01:50:49,208 --> 01:50:51,583
Blanc, are you telling us
Miles killed Duke?

2028
01:50:51,667 --> 01:50:53,625
- Yes.
<font color="white">- Why?

2029
01:50:53,708 --> 01:50:56,292
Because the night
Andi sent you all the emails,

2030
01:50:56,375 --> 01:50:59,042
when Duke got to Andi's house
early on his motorcycle…

2031
01:50:59,125 --> 01:51:00,042
[engine revving]

2032
01:51:01,417 --> 01:51:03,042
[Benoit] …<i><font color="white">he saw Miles leaving.</i>

2033
01:51:04,583 --> 01:51:05,500
[tires screeching]

2034
01:51:06,958 --> 01:51:08,333
[Benoit]<i><font color="white"> Was almost struck by him.</i>

2035
01:51:08,417 --> 01:51:12,042
<i>In fact, he told all of us.
Right out in the open, he told us.</i>

2036
01:51:12,125 --> 01:51:13,542
Iconic.

2037
01:51:14,208 --> 01:51:17,292
Remember that night you almost pancaked me
with it on the road outside of Andi's?

2038
01:51:17,375 --> 01:51:19,250
Anderson Cooper's birthday? Mm-hmm.

2039
01:51:19,333 --> 01:51:21,833
That night, at Andi's.

2040
01:51:22,417 --> 01:51:25,583
That night, Duke told us
he almost got in an accident.

2041
01:51:25,667 --> 01:51:27,083
He… pancaked?

2042
01:51:27,167 --> 01:51:30,250
Yeah, but Miles had been living in Greece
the past six months.

2043
01:51:30,333 --> 01:51:32,125
No. Whiskey.

2044
01:51:33,417 --> 01:51:36,458
Miles saw you
on your birthday in New York.

2045
01:51:36,542 --> 01:51:40,125
Gave you that necklace for your birthday.
And you're a Taurus.

2046
01:51:41,125 --> 01:51:42,208
I am.

2047
01:51:43,375 --> 01:51:44,875
Two weeks ago.

2048
01:51:44,958 --> 01:51:47,125
- [Benoit] Forget the hydrofuels…
- May 9th.

2049
01:51:47,208 --> 01:51:48,125
…and the sweatshops,

2050
01:51:48,208 --> 01:51:51,167
and the consensual cuckolding
for cable news assignments.

2051
01:51:51,250 --> 01:51:52,083
Sorry, what?

2052
01:51:52,167 --> 01:51:53,333
And focus

2053
01:51:55,208 --> 01:51:56,292
on the envelope.

2054
01:52:03,375 --> 01:52:04,458
[screams]

2055
01:52:04,542 --> 01:52:06,792
[gasps] Holy shit!

2056
01:52:10,875 --> 01:52:12,917
What is reality?

2057
01:52:14,208 --> 01:52:15,292
Andi?

2058
01:52:19,750 --> 01:52:21,458
[Benoit] Who did the envelope threaten?

2059
01:52:24,542 --> 01:52:25,667
Miles Bron.

2060
01:52:28,083 --> 01:52:33,917
<i>That night, Lionel faxed Andi's email
to Miles who received it in New York.</i>

2061
01:52:34,625 --> 01:52:37,917
<i>The one thing that could destroy
his empire of lies,</i>

2062
01:52:38,667 --> 01:52:42,792
<i>the truth in the hands
of the only person unafraid to tell it.</i>

2063
01:52:44,500 --> 01:52:47,458
<i>So Miles drives his Baby Blue Porsche</i>

2064
01:52:47,542 --> 01:52:50,708
<i>to the scene of the crime,
and Andi lets him in.</i>

2065
01:52:50,792 --> 01:52:51,917
<i>Of course she did.</i>

2066
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,833
<i>Miles' machine of lawyers and power</i>

2067
01:52:54,917 --> 01:52:58,167
<i>could destroy her
through sheer dumb force.</i>

2068
01:52:58,250 --> 01:52:59,792
<i>But Miles himself?</i>

2069
01:52:59,875 --> 01:53:02,250
<i>Oh, she was clever enough
not to fear Miles.</i>

2070
01:53:03,917 --> 01:53:10,208
<i>But she didn't see the real threat,
the obvious threat until it was too late.</i>

2071
01:53:20,292 --> 01:53:24,208
Duke alone knew you were there that night,
but he didn't know Andi was dead.

2072
01:53:24,292 --> 01:53:27,750
No, no, he didn't know that
until this evening.

2073
01:53:27,833 --> 01:53:32,000
Right here,
<font color="white">when he got a Google Alert on his phone,

2074
01:53:32,083 --> 01:53:35,125
which has now fallen strangely silent.

2075
01:53:35,625 --> 01:53:37,000
And which he showed to you…

2076
01:53:38,292 --> 01:53:39,208
[gasps]

2077
01:53:39,292 --> 01:53:41,458
…because you don't own a phone.

2078
01:53:42,042 --> 01:53:43,750
Duke! No!

2079
01:53:48,458 --> 01:53:50,375
Did he really think
he could stop all of them

2080
01:53:50,458 --> 01:53:52,208
from finding out about Andi's death?

2081
01:53:52,292 --> 01:53:53,958
They all have phones.

2082
01:53:54,042 --> 01:53:55,458
- Where's my phone?
- [Birdie] Peggy.

2083
01:53:56,250 --> 01:53:57,792
- Phone!
<font color="white">- Still no.

2084
01:53:58,500 --> 01:54:00,417
[Benoit] He didn't need to hide the death.

2085
01:54:00,500 --> 01:54:03,167
He just needed to hide
that Duke had shown him the death

2086
01:54:03,250 --> 01:54:05,542
<i>moments before he was killed.</i>

2087
01:54:06,542 --> 01:54:08,542
<i>Right out in the open, Duke showed him.</i>

2088
01:54:08,625 --> 01:54:10,333
[Duke] That changes things, right?

2089
01:54:10,417 --> 01:54:11,833
It sure does.

2090
01:54:11,917 --> 01:54:15,000
And told him exactly what he wanted
in return for his silence.

2091
01:54:15,083 --> 01:54:18,375
Numbers like this.
Maybe we can talk Alpha News?

2092
01:54:19,208 --> 01:54:21,208
You bet your ass. Come here.

2093
01:54:22,042 --> 01:54:23,542
So what does Miles do?

2094
01:54:23,625 --> 01:54:25,750
Does he keep a vial of poison
in his tooth or something?

2095
01:54:25,833 --> 01:54:26,917
Is that a rich person thing?

2096
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:31,667
No, no, no, no, it's just…
It's so much stupider than that.

2097
01:54:31,750 --> 01:54:34,667
Birdie, what are the ingredients
to your Cuban Breeze?

2098
01:54:35,292 --> 01:54:38,208
Um, vodka, amaretto.

2099
01:54:38,292 --> 01:54:39,125
Oh, God.

2100
01:54:44,875 --> 01:54:46,708
[Birdie] <i><font color="white">And… pineapple juice.</i>

2101
01:54:46,792 --> 01:54:49,458
No pineapple in that, right?
Duke don't dance with pineapple.

2102
01:54:50,042 --> 01:54:51,208
An allergy.

2103
01:54:51,292 --> 01:54:52,792
He can't even have a drop.

2104
01:54:52,875 --> 01:54:54,333
Pineapple juice!

2105
01:54:54,833 --> 01:54:58,042
He just put
<font color="white">pineapple juice in his whiskey.

2106
01:54:58,958 --> 01:55:00,375
It's so dumb.

2107
01:55:00,458 --> 01:55:02,792
Oh, it's so dumb, it's brilliant.

2108
01:55:02,875 --> 01:55:05,667
No! It's just dumb!

2109
01:55:06,542 --> 01:55:09,917
"Died of an apparent suicide.
She is survived by her sister, Helen."

2110
01:55:11,208 --> 01:55:12,083
Helen.

2111
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,500
You told me about Helen, your sister...

2112
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,917
[gasps] Oh, wait!

2113
01:55:21,875 --> 01:55:24,292
Helen Brand, ladies and gentlemen.

2114
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:31,417
And now we come
to Helen's attempted murder,

2115
01:55:31,500 --> 01:55:36,750
which, I have to give you credit for,
did have a sound foundation of thought.

2116
01:55:37,833 --> 01:55:41,333
You realized the opportunity
laid out in front of you.

2117
01:55:41,417 --> 01:55:43,333
You have a house on a remote island,

2118
01:55:43,417 --> 01:55:46,333
<i>filled with desperate people,</i>

2119
01:55:46,417 --> 01:55:51,333
all of whom have a real-life reason
to wish this woman harm. You...

2120
01:55:56,167 --> 01:56:02,500
Furthermore, you have
a loaded gun conveniently within reach.

2121
01:56:05,583 --> 01:56:08,917
And the lights had even been turned off.

2122
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:10,500
You've taken seven people,

2123
01:56:10,583 --> 01:56:13,208
each of whom has a real-life reason
to wish you harm,

2124
01:56:13,292 --> 01:56:15,583
gathered them together on a remote island,

2125
01:56:15,667 --> 01:56:19,125
and placed the idea
of your murder in their heads.

2126
01:56:19,208 --> 01:56:23,167
It's like putting a loaded gun
on the table and turning off the lights!

2127
01:56:25,083 --> 01:56:26,167
Heavens to…

2128
01:56:27,292 --> 01:56:29,750
You dim-witted, brainless

2129
01:56:30,417 --> 01:56:31,833
jackass!

2130
01:56:32,958 --> 01:56:36,667
Your one murder, with any panache at all,

2131
01:56:37,583 --> 01:56:41,458
and you stole the whole idea from me.

2132
01:56:41,542 --> 01:56:42,750
[dramatic music playing]

2133
01:56:48,167 --> 01:56:49,458
[gunshot]

2134
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:59,958
And after all that, you…
You still kept the envelope?

2135
01:57:00,875 --> 01:57:02,500
You didn't burn it or anything?

2136
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:05,500
You recognize this?

2137
01:57:06,625 --> 01:57:08,333
Andi's handwriting.

2138
01:57:09,667 --> 01:57:11,167
I got you, son of a bitch.

2139
01:57:11,250 --> 01:57:14,542
Oh, let's slow down there, sister. Okay?

2140
01:57:14,625 --> 01:57:18,375
Because first, how could you
ever prove that that's the original?

2141
01:57:18,458 --> 01:57:20,125
- She might have copied mine.
- No.</font>

2142
01:57:21,042 --> 01:57:23,542
The bar closed nine years ago,

2143
01:57:23,625 --> 01:57:26,625
and hers has one thing
that yours just doesn't.

2144
01:57:34,583 --> 01:57:36,875
Okay, but second…

2145
01:57:39,458 --> 01:57:40,292
[thuds]

2146
01:57:45,917 --> 01:57:48,292
- What the hell did he do?
- He just burned it!

2147
01:57:48,375 --> 01:57:50,375
[Miles] Burned what?
I didn't see anything.

2148
01:57:50,458 --> 01:57:51,417
[Helen] You burned it!

2149
01:57:51,500 --> 01:57:54,042
- Is someone making toast?
- This will not stand.

2150
01:57:54,125 --> 01:57:59,708
Uh-huh. Well, did you see this proof,
this smoking napkin, Blanc?

2151
01:58:01,167 --> 01:58:03,333
No. Did anybody?

2152
01:58:08,583 --> 01:58:10,208
Okay, then wow!

2153
01:58:10,917 --> 01:58:13,750
Wow! We got some big accusations
flying around here.

2154
01:58:14,458 --> 01:58:16,542
Except, everybody seems to have

2155
01:58:16,625 --> 01:58:19,125
a very foggy recollection
of what they actually saw,

2156
01:58:19,208 --> 01:58:22,542
and there's nothing
but totally circumspective evidence.

2157
01:58:22,625 --> 01:58:23,458
[sighs]

2158
01:58:23,542 --> 01:58:27,542
So, if this was just us
playing my murder mystery game,

2159
01:58:27,625 --> 01:58:30,083
which we should have been doing
all weekend,

2160
01:58:30,167 --> 01:58:33,583
then Blanc wins an iPad Pro this time.

2161
01:58:34,625 --> 01:58:36,000
But this is the real world.

2162
01:58:36,667 --> 01:58:40,375
And in the real world, you need
more than a neat, little detective story.

2163
01:58:40,458 --> 01:58:41,958
You need evidence.

2164
01:58:42,042 --> 01:58:45,167
And you've got… nothing.

2165
01:58:45,875 --> 01:58:46,875
