1
00:00:42,304 --> 00:00:44,597
Hey! Come on.
Let's move!

2
00:00:44,804 --> 00:00:45,604
No!

3
00:00:45,883 --> 00:00:47,140
- Let me see.
- No.

4
00:00:47,615 --> 00:00:48,821
Come on, I made you
special breakfast.

5
00:00:49,187 --> 00:00:49,996
You can't cook.

6
00:00:50,601 --> 00:00:52,641
Hey, Mary, open up.

7
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:55,347
GIFTED

8
00:00:57,965 --> 00:00:58,798
You look beautiful.

9
00:01:00,516 --> 00:01:02,208
I look like Disney character.

10
00:01:10,101 --> 00:01:11,316
Where's the special?

11
00:01:11,983 --> 00:01:12,399
What?

12
00:01:13,263 --> 00:01:15,093
You said you made me special breakfast.

13
00:01:20,411 --> 00:01:21,832
Please, don't make me go.

14
00:01:22,736 --> 00:01:24,053
You can keep home schooling me.

15
00:01:24,404 --> 00:01:25,993
I've taught you everything I know.

16
00:01:26,063 --> 00:01:27,254
But I don't want to go.

17
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,378
Well... I don't want to go
to work, but I do.

18
00:01:30,454 --> 00:01:33,064
You don't go to work.
You fix boats on the dock.

19
00:01:34,204 --> 00:01:35,989
Okay, it's poor example,
but you are still going.

20
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:39,810
But... But what about Fred?

21
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:40,782
What about him?

22
00:01:41,072 --> 00:01:43,008
You won't take care of him.
You don't like cats.

23
00:01:43,101 --> 00:01:45,584
I don't like two-eyed cats.
Fred is as you know, monocular.

24
00:01:45,652 --> 00:01:47,019
Who's gonna throw him his ping pong ball?

25
00:01:47,116 --> 00:01:49,012
Fred's gonna be fine,
no more argument, okay?

26
00:01:49,092 --> 00:01:50,575
We've discussed this ad nauseam.

27
00:01:53,821 --> 00:01:54,778
What's an nauseam?

28
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,582
You don't know? Looks like
someone needs school.

29
00:02:06,281 --> 00:02:07,034
This is gonna be fun.

30
00:02:07,286 --> 00:02:10,143
You're gonna meet kids today, you gonna
borrow money from the rest of your life.

31
00:02:13,314 --> 00:02:13,739
Come on.

32
00:02:18,344 --> 00:02:19,162
You gonna be great.

33
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:22,202
You know, just...

34
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:25,440
I don't know. Try bein' a kid.

35
00:02:47,716 --> 00:02:48,185
Frank!

36
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:52,044
Frank, I know you hear me.

37
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:56,819
Frank!

38
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:15,848
There's still time for you
to undo this nonsense.

39
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,384
Go get in your car and go get that child.

40
00:03:20,255 --> 00:03:22,519
Are you tehnically allowed to use
these keys whenever you want?

41
00:03:22,817 --> 00:03:24,335
How you can stand there...

42
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,614
acting all calm and all of
that making light out of this?

43
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:29,540
Now, go get her back before it's too late.

44
00:03:30,747 --> 00:03:31,639
She gotta go out in the world.

45
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,832
She has not friend her age.
No social skills.

46
00:03:34,832 --> 00:03:36,140
She doessn't know how to be a kid.

47
00:03:38,308 --> 00:03:40,502
Two nights ago she told me
that even if Germany bails up

48
00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:42,546
the euro, there could still
be worldwide depression.

49
00:03:44,122 --> 00:03:45,705
I was staring at the
celling for three hours.

50
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:49,278
I'm so worried.

51
00:03:52,235 --> 00:03:52,819
Come on, Roberta.

52
00:03:52,892 --> 00:03:55,636
If you start crying, I will have
to pretend to start crying.

53
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,394
You know there's something
you can be overlooking.

54
00:04:01,837 --> 00:04:02,583
This could work out.

55
00:04:04,336 --> 00:04:04,957
Maybe.

56
00:04:06,198 --> 00:04:07,947
But if anybody takes that baby away...

57
00:04:08,504 --> 00:04:09,726
I'll smother you in your sleep.

58
00:04:11,163 --> 00:04:11,885
Morning, Fred.

59
00:04:18,609 --> 00:04:20,041
One plus one is two.

60
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,154
That is fact number one of today.

61
00:04:22,761 --> 00:04:25,719
Who can tell me what two plus two is?

62
00:04:26,263 --> 00:04:26,973
Who's got it?

63
00:04:28,571 --> 00:04:29,146
Four.

64
00:04:29,505 --> 00:04:33,005
Excellent, Donna.
It is. Two plus two is indeed four.

65
00:04:34,087 --> 00:04:36,266
Okay, who wants to try three plus three?

66
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,750
Three plus three? Really?

67
00:04:42,738 --> 00:04:43,532
I beg your pardon?

68
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,971
What kind of school is this anyway?

69
00:04:46,415 --> 00:04:50,020
It's the kind of school, where
students don't speak without permission.

70
00:04:50,349 --> 00:04:52,634
Alright, but everyone knows it's six.

71
00:04:53,642 --> 00:04:56,060
Nobody in this classroom speaks...

72
00:04:56,668 --> 00:04:58,427
unless they're called upon.

73
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,936
Okay? Is everybody clear on that?

74
00:05:01,123 --> 00:05:02,682
Yes, ma'am.

75
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:04,948
Good. Mary, can you stand up please?

76
00:05:06,533 --> 00:05:08,246
Stand up on. Stand up, babe.

77
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:11,011
These questions are for you,
because you're so advanced.

78
00:05:13,719 --> 00:05:15,219
What is nine plus eight?

79
00:05:15,734 --> 00:05:16,501
Seventeen.

80
00:05:17,232 --> 00:05:19,620
Yeah, yes, it is. That's good.

81
00:05:20,936 --> 00:05:23,481
What is...
fifteen plus seventeen?

82
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:24,485
Thirty-two.

83
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:29,645
Yeah, that is... That is right.

84
00:05:30,253 --> 00:05:31,074
Alright then.

85
00:05:31,224 --> 00:05:35,330
Well, what is 57 plus 135?

86
00:05:35,767 --> 00:05:37,173
192.

87
00:05:41,562 --> 00:05:42,173
Yeah.

88
00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:57,481
Can you tell me...
What 57 multiplied by 135 is?

89
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:09,962
Okay.

90
00:06:10,963 --> 00:06:17,649
- Who can tell me what four...
- 7695.

91
00:06:19,239 --> 00:06:20,299
I don't think anyone can do that.

92
00:06:22,855 --> 00:06:25,249
The square root is 87.7.

93
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:27,882
And change.

94
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:31,778
Now what does ad nauseam mean?

95
00:06:33,775 --> 00:06:35,533
I have very strange kid.

96
00:06:35,801 --> 00:06:37,352
I have 27 strange kids.

97
00:06:37,508 --> 00:06:38,579
Good morning.

98
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:39,461
Good morning, good morning.

99
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,849
That's great, guys,
but take your seats, okay?

100
00:06:42,003 --> 00:06:44,026
Oh, God, see ya.

101
00:06:45,088 --> 00:06:46,191
Good morning, Miss Stevenson.

102
00:06:46,326 --> 00:06:46,968
Good morning.

103
00:06:47,503 --> 00:06:49,725
- Mind if I sit in?
- Not at all.

104
00:06:50,402 --> 00:06:52,561
Okay, class.
I have a treat for you.

105
00:06:52,852 --> 00:06:57,871
I would like to introduce you to
our principal Mrs. Davis.

106
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,963
Good morning, first graders.

107
00:07:00,148 --> 00:07:03,361
Good morning, Mrs. Davis.

108
00:07:03,535 --> 00:07:07,589
- Are you ready for a great year?
- Yes.

109
00:07:09,434 --> 00:07:10,203
Yes, Mary?

110
00:07:10,238 --> 00:07:11,048
She's the boss?

111
00:07:12,323 --> 00:07:14,443
Mrs. Davis is our principal, okay.

112
00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:17,574
Ok, now I want you to get on
your phone and call Frank

113
00:07:17,726 --> 00:07:19,217
and told him to get me out of here!

114
00:07:23,995 --> 00:07:26,127
Wait a minute. That's the dad? I know him.

115
00:07:26,283 --> 00:07:28,167
I see him at Ferg's
almost every Friday night.

116
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,587
He's the quiet damaged hot guy.

117
00:07:32,344 --> 00:07:34,112
What are you doing at
Ferg's every Friday night?

118
00:07:34,636 --> 00:07:35,998
Trying to get picked up by him.

119
00:07:41,937 --> 00:07:43,872
Excuse me? Hi.

120
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:46,441
Look it's my teacher.

121
00:07:46,829 --> 00:07:49,240
Probably she wants
to remind me what one plus one is.

122
00:07:49,643 --> 00:07:50,499
Go to the car, okay?

123
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,625
- Hi.
- Hi.

124
00:07:52,784 --> 00:07:54,265
Sorry to yell at you
and then chase you down.

125
00:07:54,404 --> 00:07:55,517
It's okay. Mary's teacher?

126
00:07:55,629 --> 00:07:56,653
Yes. I'm Bonnie Stevens.

127
00:07:56,653 --> 00:07:58,165
Frank. How are you? Sorry about today.

128
00:07:58,272 --> 00:08:01,073
She got little overexcited.
It's just first day jitters.

129
00:08:01,235 --> 00:08:01,928
Sure, yeah.

130
00:08:02,053 --> 00:08:03,540
We are running a little bit late
actually, so we gotta get going.

131
00:08:03,653 --> 00:08:05,492
Okay, I don't even wanna talk about that.

132
00:08:05,987 --> 00:08:07,419
- I will keep you just a minute.
- Okay.

133
00:08:07,673 --> 00:08:10,150
I think your daugter...

134
00:08:10,643 --> 00:08:12,274
I think Mary might be gifted.

135
00:08:14,092 --> 00:08:14,507
What?

136
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:18,362
Yeah, today in math,
she answered some really...

137
00:08:18,946 --> 00:08:20,572
- No, that's...
- No, please.

138
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,181
- It's not gifted.
- Really difficult questions.

139
00:08:22,304 --> 00:08:22,654
Right.

140
00:08:22,812 --> 00:08:24,982
- Just the seven year old would...
- It's Trachtenberg.

141
00:08:26,504 --> 00:08:28,340
- Jakow Trachtenberg.
- I'm sorry?

142
00:08:28,613 --> 00:08:30,777
Spent seven years in a concentration camp.

143
00:08:30,942 --> 00:08:33,068
Developed the sistem to
rapidly solve problems.

144
00:08:34,607 --> 00:08:35,440
It's the Trachtenberg method.

145
00:08:37,055 --> 00:08:37,670
But she is...

146
00:08:38,604 --> 00:08:40,549
I mean... She's seven though.

147
00:08:40,672 --> 00:08:41,570
I learned it when I was eight.

148
00:08:42,753 --> 00:08:43,621
Do I look gifted to you?

149
00:08:45,797 --> 00:08:48,067
It kinda go out of note since the
invention of the calculator...

150
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:51,037
But... I can still win a drink
at the bar using it.

151
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,040
Sorry for today.

152
00:08:53,606 --> 00:08:54,367
Won't happen again.

153
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:55,089
Okay.

154
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,049
Nice to meet you.

155
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:57,072
Bonnie.

156
00:08:57,558 --> 00:08:58,009
Frank.

157
00:09:07,122 --> 00:09:09,115
Trachenberg method.

158
00:09:20,305 --> 00:09:23,409
For the record, I didn't wanna go to
the stupid school in the first place.

159
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:27,279
And the boy in the front row acts
inappropriately for someonewho's a child.

160
00:09:28,214 --> 00:09:30,549
Sorry. I'm still passive
agressively ignoring you.

161
00:09:31,733 --> 00:09:34,175
Other kids answer questions,
they don't get in trouble.

162
00:09:34,495 --> 00:09:36,095
You didn't get in trouble
for answering the questions.

163
00:09:36,728 --> 00:09:37,618
You yelled at the principle.

164
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,631
All right, you know what?
You're gonna find this interesting.

165
00:09:41,225 --> 00:09:43,123
So I googled
"first graders who yelled at the principal"

166
00:09:43,598 --> 00:09:45,677
And statistically you will never
believe how many kids do it.

167
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:46,790
How many?

168
00:09:47,607 --> 00:09:48,047
None.

169
00:09:52,286 --> 00:09:54,132
Frank, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

170
00:09:54,925 --> 00:09:55,493
Yeah, right.

171
00:09:56,885 --> 00:09:58,484
You can't show off like that in school.

172
00:09:58,898 --> 00:09:59,560
I know.

173
00:10:00,255 --> 00:10:02,025
You promised you wouldn't
then at the first day...

174
00:10:02,122 --> 00:10:03,618
I know, I screwed up.

175
00:10:08,702 --> 00:10:10,672
Do you think this boat needs a test ride?

176
00:10:14,485 --> 00:10:15,092
Go get, Fred.

177
00:10:16,656 --> 00:10:17,340
Don't run.

178
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:32,528
d I listen to the wind,
to the wind of my soul d

179
00:10:36,138 --> 00:10:40,592
d Where I will end up, well
I think only God really knows d

180
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:47,273
d I've sat upon the setting sun d

181
00:10:48,212 --> 00:10:51,962

182
00:10:53,025 --> 00:10:55,815

183
00:10:56,462 --> 00:10:59,449
d Never, never, never d

184
00:11:00,108 --> 00:11:01,959
Fred loves to watch the sandpipers.

185
00:11:03,707 --> 00:11:05,207
He thinks he'd like to catch one,

186
00:11:05,576 --> 00:11:06,584
but he'd regret it.

187
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:08,907
Fred's not the killer.

188
00:11:09,982 --> 00:11:10,758
He's a lover.

189
00:11:17,917 --> 00:11:20,062
Would mom want me to go to school?

190
00:11:21,131 --> 00:11:21,883
I can only guess.

191
00:11:23,872 --> 00:11:25,869
But I will tell you that, she would
have wanted you to have friends.

192
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:27,905
Idiot friends?

193
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:31,807
She'd want you to have
compassion for others.

194
00:11:33,598 --> 00:11:35,552
Like a cat can have for a sandpiper.

195
00:11:39,326 --> 00:11:40,482
But what if they don't like me?

196
00:11:43,232 --> 00:11:44,049
Then they're idiots.

197
00:11:55,564 --> 00:11:56,793
Good morning, class.

198
00:11:57,165 --> 00:12:00,166
Good moring, Mrs. Stevenson.

199
00:12:01,674 --> 00:12:02,561
Good morning, Mary.

200
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,950
Good morning, Mrs. Stevenson.

201
00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:10,180
Okay, good morning.

202
00:12:14,404 --> 00:12:15,705
Get a hold of yourself.

203
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,619
For my Show and tell I have...

204
00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:22,239
the most awesome cat
in the history of times.

205
00:12:22,889 --> 00:12:25,372
Not only is his name Fred, but...

206
00:12:29,617 --> 00:12:31,697
He has just one eye.

207
00:12:32,531 --> 00:12:34,277
Uno. Go ahead and count...

208
00:12:34,434 --> 00:12:37,415
but I promise you is always one.

209
00:12:37,793 --> 00:12:39,057
How did he lose his eye?

210
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,394
I don't know. I wasn't there.

211
00:12:42,544 --> 00:12:46,817
Just found him inside a trash can next
to the bottle of alcohol or something.

212
00:12:46,943 --> 00:12:50,708
He is a smart, smart cat,
but no one realizes that.

213
00:12:51,056 --> 00:12:53,605
No one understands him. No one.

214
00:12:54,193 --> 00:12:57,078
Put your name in on the top of the paper,

215
00:12:57,789 --> 00:13:00,072
so I know who did such a good work.

216
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:01,924
I left my pen with you.

217
00:13:02,068 --> 00:13:02,955
Pass those around guys.

218
00:13:03,635 --> 00:13:04,860
Okay? I wanna see your work.

219
00:13:05,031 --> 00:13:06,480
Turn around. Face the desk.

220
00:13:07,983 --> 00:13:13,374
Think about how you get to the answer.
It's not just about, you know, guessing.

221
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,013
Don't be messy.

222
00:13:16,022 --> 00:13:16,626
Done.

223
00:13:27,099 --> 00:13:27,779
Let me see.

224
00:13:31,834 --> 00:13:35,562
Okay, I thought you might finish quickly,
so a little something extra.

225
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:24,695
Done.

226
00:14:40,827 --> 00:14:43,031
Francis Adler

227
00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:46,339
Frank Adler speaks at this
year's Leader's Conference

228
00:14:50,576 --> 00:14:52,525
Francis Adler, mathematician

229
00:14:58,117 --> 00:15:01,931
A Mind for math: Is Diane Adler the missing female variable
that finally solves the Navier-Stokes Equation?

230
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:25,413
Renowned Mathematician dead of an
apparent suicide

231
00:15:28,703 --> 00:15:34,318
She is survived by a brother Frank.

232
00:15:57,524 --> 00:15:58,206
Do you know who I am?

233
00:15:58,517 --> 00:16:01,999
Hey! Mary's teacher...

234
00:16:03,319 --> 00:16:03,979
Bonnie.

235
00:16:04,173 --> 00:16:04,923
You lied to me.

236
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:07,068
Okay.

237
00:16:07,984 --> 00:16:08,790
Can you narrow it down?

238
00:16:09,804 --> 00:16:11,255
I'd like to know the truth about Mary...

239
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:12,420
... my student.

240
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,913
Your niece.

241
00:16:18,468 --> 00:16:20,380
I was running ridiculously
late for a date...

242
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:22,928
and my sister showed up with Mary.

243
00:16:23,139 --> 00:16:25,848
She never showed up unannounced.
She never showed up with the baby.

244
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:29,617
She said she wanted to talk.

245
00:16:31,289 --> 00:16:32,324
She said she needed to talk.

246
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:34,989
I told her I will talk to her when I
got back.

247
00:16:35,296 --> 00:16:38,870
I think I figured showing up late to my date
would hurt my chances of gettin' laid.

248
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:43,401
Came home that night and
Mary was on the couch...

249
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,474
and found Diane on the bathroom floor.

250
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,377
I mean, there's no way I could've
known, but...

251
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,635
I shoulda known.

252
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:57,224
6 and a half years later me and Mary
are still hangin' out.

253
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,463
And what about the father?

254
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,311
Diane was so socially akward...

255
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:05,715
She didn't date enough to know
a good guy from a bad guy.

256
00:17:06,614 --> 00:17:08,538
This particular guy didn't last for month.

257
00:17:08,946 --> 00:17:10,274
And no grandparents?

258
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:14,511
Dad died when I was eight. My mom...

259
00:17:15,895 --> 00:17:19,768
She went virgin and she turn back on Diane
when she got pregnant.

260
00:17:21,753 --> 00:17:22,252
Why?

261
00:17:24,841 --> 00:17:25,942
Didn't fit into her plan.

262
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:29,943
She is exacting woman, my mother.

263
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:31,610
Uncompromising.

264
00:17:34,242 --> 00:17:34,903
Very British.

265
00:17:35,183 --> 00:17:38,170
Do you mean British in demeanor or...

266
00:17:38,351 --> 00:17:40,019
- No. Like she is...
- She's from England.

267
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,276
From England. Yeah.

268
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:49,530
So Mary is a genius?

269
00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:25,193
Look out. Look out.

270
00:18:25,308 --> 00:18:27,494
Your little animals are escaping, dumbass.

271
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,201
Hey! You should not be laughing!

272
00:18:31,784 --> 00:18:33,765
You did a mean thing to a little kid.

273
00:18:34,161 --> 00:18:35,211
What are you gonna do about it?

274
00:18:55,178 --> 00:18:57,562
Hey. Hey, you okay?

275
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,914
You good? All right.

276
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:05,220
How do we resolve this? You know,
she could be expelled.

277
00:19:06,316 --> 00:19:08,150
God. I hope not.

278
00:19:08,694 --> 00:19:11,848
But if any first-time offenders got
expelled, well I guess fair is fair.

279
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,302
Are you gonna take
this serously?

280
00:19:13,822 --> 00:19:16,636
Sure. You don't bluff me. I don't
bluff you.

281
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:22,908
Miss Stevenson believes that your
child is exceptional.

282
00:19:23,448 --> 00:19:27,209
And has talents that our cricium
can't begin to challenge.

283
00:19:27,361 --> 00:19:31,140
It just so happens, that I'm good friend
with the headmaster...

284
00:19:31,244 --> 00:19:34,101
... of the Oaks Academy for
Gifted Education.

285
00:19:34,217 --> 00:19:37,402
He always said that if I find that
one in a million...

286
00:19:37,713 --> 00:19:40,619
And the one in a million has a
$30.000 tuition.

287
00:19:40,806 --> 00:19:42,844
Mr. Edgar, I can get your
daughter a scolarship.

288
00:19:43,116 --> 00:19:43,993
Full ride.

289
00:19:44,768 --> 00:19:46,358
I wouldn't say it, if I couldn't
do it.

290
00:19:58,478 --> 00:20:00,747
I realize, putting that girl in that
setting...

291
00:20:01,664 --> 00:20:04,544
You know, 99 times out of a 100, that's
is what you do.

292
00:20:04,657 --> 00:20:06,730
It's the Oaks. It's great school.
I looked into it.

293
00:20:08,189 --> 00:20:10,240
This family has a history with
those schools.

294
00:20:11,908 --> 00:20:13,986
And I think the last thing that
little girl needs...

295
00:20:14,132 --> 00:20:16,004
is reinforcement that she's
different.

296
00:20:17,411 --> 00:20:19,042
Trust me, she knows, so...

297
00:20:21,501 --> 00:20:24,856
I think Mary. I think she's gotta
be here.

298
00:20:26,527 --> 00:20:28,313
Today's bad ending, you can't
hit people.

299
00:20:28,367 --> 00:20:31,467
But a 12 year old bullies a 7 year old
and she stands up?

300
00:20:32,453 --> 00:20:34,467
Do you know how important
that is to me that she did that?

301
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,490
You know how proud I am of her?
Aren't you?

302
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:39,586
Mr. Edgar, your daughter shattered a
young boy's...

303
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,219
I know. You can't hit people.

304
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:43,284
That will be made
very clear. I get that.

305
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:45,742
But Miss Davis, if we seperate
our leaders...

306
00:20:45,894 --> 00:20:48,294
If we segregate them from people
like you and me...

307
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:50,783
you get congressman.

308
00:20:52,997 --> 00:20:55,690
So I'm sorry. I wish I can take
you offer, but Mary stays.

309
00:20:56,169 --> 00:20:57,134
Unless you kick her out.

310
00:20:57,219 --> 00:21:00,302
This is a mistake. We'll never
be able to raise this child...

311
00:21:00,424 --> 00:21:02,634
to the level of scholarship she deserves.

312
00:21:04,033 --> 00:21:07,577
Well... She dumb her down to a
decent human being.

313
00:21:08,349 --> 00:21:09,260
Everybody wins.

314
00:21:14,363 --> 00:21:17,108
You know what? Just...
Can you excuse me for just 1 minute?

315
00:21:18,118 --> 00:21:20,547
Bring me all the piece of
paperwork we have on this girl.

316
00:21:23,356 --> 00:21:23,909
Hey.

317
00:21:27,502 --> 00:21:28,942
Are you sure you know what
you're doing?

318
00:21:33,113 --> 00:21:33,684
No.

319
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:43,103
Okay Mary, I think you have something
?ou'd like to say to the class

320
00:21:43,255 --> 00:21:44,446
You wanna hop up and say it?

321
00:21:50,403 --> 00:21:52,899
Okay. I'm supposed to say something.

322
00:21:54,004 --> 00:21:57,250
Hitting people is wrong even if the're bad.

323
00:21:58,323 --> 00:22:01,521
I won't do it again, so don't be
afraid of me.

324
00:22:04,386 --> 00:22:05,874
Okay. Thank you.

325
00:22:06,401 --> 00:22:08,142
Now I can say something I wanna say?

326
00:22:09,435 --> 00:22:10,048
Sure.

327
00:22:11,731 --> 00:22:12,830
Before they ruined it...

328
00:22:13,507 --> 00:22:15,903
Justin's zoo was the best
art project.

329
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,575
By far. It was awesome.

330
00:22:22,337 --> 00:22:25,191
Come on. A little harder.

331
00:22:27,548 --> 00:22:28,495
Okay.

332
00:22:29,827 --> 00:22:31,743
Thank you. Thank you.

333
00:22:38,908 --> 00:22:40,759
There's a lady standing in front
of our door.

334
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,152
Who is it?

335
00:22:42,632 --> 00:22:44,046
How should I know? I'm seven.

336
00:22:48,592 --> 00:22:49,586
That would be your grandmother.

337
00:22:51,196 --> 00:22:53,346
Holy shit!

338
00:22:56,325 --> 00:22:57,193
An Apple?

339
00:22:59,718 --> 00:23:01,259
It's a MacBook, darling.

340
00:23:01,806 --> 00:23:03,971
Top of the line with the Retina display.

341
00:23:05,235 --> 00:23:06,630
You know who else has
a Retina display?

342
00:23:06,983 --> 00:23:07,633
Fred!

343
00:23:08,589 --> 00:23:11,344
Mary, I understand you like mathematics.

344
00:23:12,049 --> 00:23:13,462
So, on there...

345
00:23:13,979 --> 00:23:17,013
You will found a great out of print book by
Charles Zimmer...

346
00:23:17,727 --> 00:23:19,792
called Transitions in Advanced Algebra.

347
00:23:20,698 --> 00:23:22,070
Yeah. Love that book.

348
00:23:24,397 --> 00:23:25,472
You're saying you've read it?

349
00:23:25,677 --> 00:23:28,628
Yeah, I've kinda moved on to differential
equations now.

350
00:23:29,995 --> 00:23:31,717
Don't forget your manners.
Thank you, grandma.

351
00:23:32,313 --> 00:23:33,033
Thank you, grandma.

352
00:23:33,391 --> 00:23:35,584
Grandmother or Evelyn will do just fine.

353
00:23:37,509 --> 00:23:39,283
There's so much more on there.

354
00:23:40,099 --> 00:23:41,296
Things I know you'll find
really challenging.

355
00:23:41,496 --> 00:23:44,279
Yes, but sadly it's a school night
and there's homework to do.

356
00:23:45,101 --> 00:23:46,322
What a surprise though, right?

357
00:23:47,433 --> 00:23:48,898
Say good night to Grandmother
or Evelyn.

358
00:23:49,924 --> 00:23:50,666
Good night.

359
00:23:51,879 --> 00:23:53,697
I'd kill a priest for a Benadryl.

360
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:54,908
Still with a allergies?

361
00:23:55,453 --> 00:23:58,389
Why have you got a cat?
You don't even like cats.

362
00:23:58,465 --> 00:24:01,021
Not my cat, it's Mary's cat.
I'm just along for a ride.

363
00:24:01,551 --> 00:24:04,021
So let me guess, our lovely principal,
Miss Davis.

364
00:24:04,298 --> 00:24:07,615
Never get on the bad side of small minded people
who have a little authority.

365
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:08,971
I thought I taught you that.

366
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:12,049
What are you doin' here?

367
00:24:12,449 --> 00:24:14,272
You don't think I have a right to see
my granddaughter?

368
00:24:14,478 --> 00:24:16,864
I do. I'm thrilled your seven year exhaust
of search...

369
00:24:17,023 --> 00:24:18,620
has finally come to a fruitful conclusion.

370
00:24:20,082 --> 00:24:22,343
I don't think this is appropriate time
to talk.

371
00:24:22,988 --> 00:24:23,978
Certantly not the setting.

372
00:24:24,221 --> 00:24:27,713
When I was waiting a cockroach this big
tried to steal my shoe.

373
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,542
Yeah. They'll take the shoe.

374
00:24:31,755 --> 00:24:33,425
Honestly, this?

375
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:37,514
This god for sake mosquito ranch
was a conscious choice?

376
00:24:39,524 --> 00:24:41,191
I could drop you back off at the
airport.

377
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:05,383
This thing is loaded with cool problems.

378
00:25:14,101 --> 00:25:15,898
So, are you teaching?

379
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:17,057
I repair boats.

380
00:25:18,065 --> 00:25:19,458
- Please.
- I'm not bad at it either.

381
00:25:20,267 --> 00:25:21,781
Well, then, that explains this.

382
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,457
They don't sell sunscreen here?

383
00:25:24,331 --> 00:25:25,059
I wear sunscreen.

384
00:25:25,332 --> 00:25:27,202
Not enough. And you need a hat.

385
00:25:27,565 --> 00:25:29,951
A big hat that shades your face and neck.

386
00:25:30,413 --> 00:25:31,867
You're playing Russian roulette
with your skin.

387
00:25:32,058 --> 00:25:33,387
- You look like porn producer.
- Okay.

388
00:25:33,856 --> 00:25:35,363
I appreciate the advice. I do.

389
00:25:36,137 --> 00:25:37,833
But we're not here to talk about
sunscreen, are we?

390
00:25:38,229 --> 00:25:40,342
So no more small talk? That's a shame.

391
00:25:41,221 --> 00:25:44,318
Okay, the enviroment you have
created for that child...

392
00:25:44,443 --> 00:25:47,316
Where she lives, the school she attends
it's substandard. Every bit of it.

393
00:25:47,471 --> 00:25:48,024
I disagree.

394
00:25:48,944 --> 00:25:50,561
We're getting nowhere if we're
not being honest with eachother.

395
00:25:50,675 --> 00:25:51,916
I am being honest.

396
00:25:52,964 --> 00:25:55,939
I see. Fine. Well, I'm not leaving
without her.

397
00:25:56,396 --> 00:25:58,461
Well, welcome to Florida.

398
00:25:59,033 --> 00:26:00,777
Frank, please listen to reason.

399
00:26:01,277 --> 00:26:03,353
At some point, are you gonna get to
conclusion...

400
00:26:03,487 --> 00:26:05,614
or someone in authority are going to
spell it out for you...

401
00:26:05,744 --> 00:26:08,042
that the child best interest is all that
matters.

402
00:26:08,154 --> 00:26:09,249
You're gonna make me pull rank, I will.

403
00:26:10,434 --> 00:26:11,533
Diane didn't want you to have her.

404
00:26:12,247 --> 00:26:13,232
Diane...

405
00:26:15,415 --> 00:26:16,937
Diane didn't always think things through.

406
00:26:17,094 --> 00:26:18,945
Argue with propably one of the
brightest minds on the planet.

407
00:26:19,043 --> 00:26:20,241
Good luck going down that road.

408
00:26:20,402 --> 00:26:22,831
And what do you thin she'd say if she saw
how her child is living now?

409
00:26:23,621 --> 00:26:25,465
Do you honestly think she'd be pleased?

410
00:26:25,587 --> 00:26:28,013
That she's living somewhat normal life? Yes.
I do.

411
00:26:28,118 --> 00:26:29,986
She's not normal. And threating her such...

412
00:26:30,132 --> 00:26:31,960
is negligence on a grand scale.

413
00:26:32,367 --> 00:26:34,411
I know your heart's in the
right place on this.

414
00:26:35,114 --> 00:26:37,256
But you are denying the girl her potential.

415
00:26:38,813 --> 00:26:41,114
I can provide for her. I can enrich
her life.

416
00:26:41,371 --> 00:26:41,914
Come on, Evelyn.

417
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:44,051
You're gonna take that girl, you are gonna
bury her in tutors...

418
00:26:44,209 --> 00:26:45,627
The you'll lown her out to some
think tank

419
00:26:45,775 --> 00:26:47,389
where she could talk non-trivial zeros...

420
00:26:47,534 --> 00:26:49,452
with a bunch of old Russian guys
for the rest of her life.

421
00:26:49,612 --> 00:26:51,053
And you'd bury her under a rock.

422
00:26:51,556 --> 00:26:54,608
Look, I didn't expect you to understand the
price you have to pay for greatness.

423
00:26:54,731 --> 00:26:57,250
I do. That's why I have Mary in the
first place.

424
00:26:57,947 --> 00:26:59,128
That's uncalled for.

425
00:26:59,694 --> 00:27:01,517
Your sister had a laundry list
of problems.

426
00:27:01,746 --> 00:27:03,726
She could have solved Navier-Stokes
and go down in the history

427
00:27:03,864 --> 00:27:05,643
as one of the greatest mathematicians
of all time.

428
00:27:05,891 --> 00:27:07,770
But she didn't, because she couldn't finish.

429
00:27:08,147 --> 00:27:11,190
She was weak. Weak like a father
and weak like...

430
00:27:15,565 --> 00:27:15,950
Well...

431
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,292
Now, if it's who I think it is...

432
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:21,409
Kinda puts a black cloud over our luncheon.

433
00:27:21,663 --> 00:27:23,781
You're still stubborn and vindictive.

434
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:25,981
Careful, Mother.

435
00:27:26,668 --> 00:27:28,357
There's an apple and tree
analogy lurking.

436
00:27:29,775 --> 00:27:30,566
You guys ready to order?

437
00:27:31,921 --> 00:27:32,603
Here's an idea.

438
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,220
Stop thinking about me and you...

439
00:27:35,498 --> 00:27:37,346
and start thinking what's best
for a child.

440
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:40,841
For any reasonable person,
a clear picture will emerge.

441
00:27:41,767 --> 00:27:44,248
If it doesn't, I suggest you call
your attorney.

442
00:27:46,943 --> 00:27:48,109
He'll have a bucket of beer.

443
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:18,242
Let's go outside.

444
00:28:21,035 --> 00:28:21,831
No.

445
00:28:23,494 --> 00:28:24,388
Come on. It's nice out.

446
00:28:25,431 --> 00:28:26,904
I don't care.

447
00:28:34,832 --> 00:28:35,662
No more math today.

448
00:28:48,233 --> 00:28:49,204
Is there a God?

449
00:28:49,804 --> 00:28:50,327
I don't know.

450
00:28:50,889 --> 00:28:52,090
Just tell me.

451
00:28:52,656 --> 00:28:53,471
I would if I could.

452
00:28:54,494 --> 00:28:56,164
But I don't know. Neither does anybody
else.

453
00:28:57,027 --> 00:28:57,836
Roberta knows.

454
00:28:58,762 --> 00:29:00,679
No. Roberta has faith...

455
00:29:01,199 --> 00:29:02,307
and that's the great thing to have.

456
00:29:02,628 --> 00:29:05,139
But faith's about what you think, feel.
Not what you know.

457
00:29:06,443 --> 00:29:07,465
What about Jesus?

458
00:29:08,221 --> 00:29:09,642
Love that guy. Do what he says.

459
00:29:10,361 --> 00:29:11,562
But is he God?

460
00:29:13,553 --> 00:29:14,042
I don't know.

461
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:15,902
I have an opinion.

462
00:29:16,641 --> 00:29:18,373
But that's my opinion and
I could be wrong.

463
00:29:18,663 --> 00:29:19,821
So why would I screw up yours?

464
00:29:21,882 --> 00:29:22,496
Use your head.

465
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:24,874
But don't be afraid to believe in things
habit.

466
00:29:29,828 --> 00:29:32,398
There was a guy on TV who said
there was no God.

467
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,900
The only thing different between
the things you saw on TV and Roberta

468
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:38,963
is Roberta loves you. She tries to help.

469
00:29:40,804 --> 00:29:41,514
Tell you what though.

470
00:29:42,913 --> 00:29:45,458
When we all one another,
we all end up back together at the end.

471
00:29:46,806 --> 00:29:47,676
That's what you're asking, right?

472
00:29:50,096 --> 00:29:51,089
Yep.

473
00:29:51,837 --> 00:29:52,499
Okay.

474
00:29:53,218 --> 00:29:54,934
Find something else to worry about, will ya?

475
00:29:55,974 --> 00:29:56,558
All right.

476
00:30:00,758 --> 00:30:03,144
Okay. Adler, grandmother and uncle.

477
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:05,639
Really?

478
00:30:08,091 --> 00:30:10,198
Sure you folks don't wanna go on the hall
and settle this?

479
00:30:14,137 --> 00:30:15,418
No? Well, that's a shame.

480
00:30:16,614 --> 00:30:19,936
- Mr. Cullen, you're here for the uncle.
- Yes, I am, your honor.

481
00:30:20,221 --> 00:30:21,540
Start charging you room and board.

482
00:30:21,781 --> 00:30:23,938
Mr. Highsmith, you're on the wrong side
of a bay, aren't you?

483
00:30:25,479 --> 00:30:26,700
I'm very happy to be here, Your Honor.

484
00:30:27,118 --> 00:30:29,616
For the record, Mrs. Dibbons is
representing the state of Florida

485
00:30:29,771 --> 00:30:30,873
Child Welfare Department.

486
00:30:31,122 --> 00:30:31,676
Proceed.

487
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:35,308
Your Honor, my client Mrs. Adler
is the maternal grandmother of the child.

488
00:30:35,682 --> 00:30:38,083
Her daughter, the girl's mother
was the troubled woman...

489
00:30:38,221 --> 00:30:39,943
who seven years ago sadly took her own
life.

490
00:30:40,427 --> 00:30:43,930
It was at this time that Mr. Adler
primitively and illegally took

491
00:30:44,084 --> 00:30:46,403
custody of the girl and spirited her
across eight lines...

492
00:30:46,556 --> 00:30:48,297
for the purpose of denying my
client custody.

493
00:30:49,177 --> 00:30:51,186
And there's the evidence that the
child currently lives

494
00:30:51,227 --> 00:30:53,426
in unclean and unwholesome conditions.

495
00:30:54,417 --> 00:30:57,293
We petition to court?to grant my client
and full custoy of the child...

496
00:30:57,455 --> 00:30:59,655
so that she can return to the state
of Massachusetts...

497
00:30:59,822 --> 00:31:01,412
and given the care to which
she is entitled.

498
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:07,765
My client took an infant under his wing
for one reason only.

499
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:10,429
It was his sister's desire
that he do so.

500
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,725
My client has been her
constant caregiver.

501
00:31:12,899 --> 00:31:14,660
And your Honor, as far as the living
conditions...

502
00:31:14,824 --> 00:31:16,966
I've been in this home.
It's fine.

503
00:31:17,304 --> 00:31:21,321
I mean, if we adopt standards based on
our friend's aversion to palmetto bugs...

504
00:31:21,568 --> 00:31:23,835
we won't have a child left
side of Tallahassee.

505
00:31:28,114 --> 00:31:31,144
All right, last chance before this starts
cost a lot more money.

506
00:31:31,448 --> 00:31:34,269
Your Honor, my client would
need reasonable acess to the child.

507
00:31:34,382 --> 00:31:35,170
So ordered.

508
00:31:35,629 --> 00:31:37,750
Ms. Dibbons, would you go out and
check the living conditions?

509
00:31:37,995 --> 00:31:38,925
On the books, Your Honor.

510
00:31:39,133 --> 00:31:40,140
All right, folks.
Drive carefully.

511
00:31:43,027 --> 00:31:44,237
Her lawyer has a nice suit.

512
00:31:45,317 --> 00:31:48,070
Relax, Frank. More weight's
put on the talent competition.

513
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:49,924
Go have a cocktail.

514
00:31:52,179 --> 00:31:54,312
Roberta, would you like to have
Mary tonight?

515
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:56,709
Why wouldn't I like
to have Mary tonight?

516
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,790
I told you something like this
would happen.

517
00:32:01,443 --> 00:32:02,290
Now look where we are.

518
00:32:04,059 --> 00:32:05,341
And I'm supposed to believe
you know what you're doing.

519
00:32:05,493 --> 00:32:06,566
You couldn't even find the
white lawyer.

520
00:32:08,664 --> 00:32:09,434
Look, just...

521
00:32:10,367 --> 00:32:11,571
- Don't worry, okay?
- Don't tell me that.

522
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,490
There's nothing you can say that's
make me fell good...

523
00:32:13,639 --> 00:32:15,784
because I have no say in any of this,
Frank.

524
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:18,048
I'm not a blood relative,
I'm not a legal guardian.

525
00:32:18,221 --> 00:32:18,829
I'm nothing.

526
00:32:19,256 --> 00:32:21,406
Just the lady who lives next door,
whose opinion means nothing,

527
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,608
whose feelings means nothing.

528
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,414
Would I like to have Mary
tonight?

529
00:32:26,973 --> 00:32:28,383
I'd like to have Mary every
night.

530
00:32:35,124 --> 00:32:36,088
d Can't stop me now d

531
00:32:37,256 --> 00:32:38,358

d Shame, shame on you d

543
00:33:16,596 --> 00:33:17,158
Hi.

544
00:33:20,129 --> 00:33:20,589
Hi.

545
00:33:23,731 --> 00:33:25,969
I heard Davis bragging about
a custody case...

546
00:33:26,207 --> 00:33:27,909
and the I found out who's
and I am...

547
00:33:28,711 --> 00:33:32,064
I feel terrible. But I also wanted you
to know that after we talked...

548
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,291
I didn't say anything to anyone.

549
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:34,708
I swear.

550
00:33:35,956 --> 00:33:39,035
And it's important to me
that you know that.

551
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:40,575
I know.

552
00:33:43,784 --> 00:33:44,333
Okay.

553
00:33:45,067 --> 00:33:46,320
My lawyer told me to get
drunk.

554
00:33:49,546 --> 00:33:50,721
And you trying to do it
with that?

555
00:33:56,118 --> 00:33:56,992
Okay. My turn.

556
00:33:59,112 --> 00:34:00,702
Who was your first
celebrity crush?

557
00:34:02,737 --> 00:34:03,390
I'll go with...

558
00:34:04,631 --> 00:34:06,479
Mona from Who's the boss?

559
00:34:06,819 --> 00:34:08,450
- Oh, wow.
- You know what I'm talking about?

560
00:34:08,594 --> 00:34:09,605
- The sexy grandmother.
- Yeah!

561
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:11,293
I always felt like she
had a secret.

562
00:34:11,686 --> 00:34:13,683
Yeah, which is that she loved
sexual intercourse.

563
00:34:13,848 --> 00:34:14,293
That was it.

564
00:34:14,688 --> 00:34:15,668
And she wasn't secret about it.

565
00:34:15,873 --> 00:34:17,528
That's why I liked her.

566
00:34:18,735 --> 00:34:20,130
You know what? I liked her too.

567
00:34:20,368 --> 00:34:20,995
See?

568
00:34:22,601 --> 00:34:23,113
All right.

569
00:34:24,761 --> 00:34:26,414
Least favourite student.
And why.

570
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:29,063
Oh, no! I love all
my students.

571
00:34:29,196 --> 00:34:32,427
I don't believe you. Not at all!
Not for a second.

572
00:34:32,587 --> 00:34:33,738
No, they're all great.

573
00:34:33,916 --> 00:34:34,755
They're all so great.

574
00:34:37,081 --> 00:34:38,096
I'm gonna go ahead and drink.

575
00:34:38,357 --> 00:34:39,818
Let's keep this honest.

576
00:34:40,167 --> 00:34:41,093
He? She?

577
00:34:42,114 --> 00:34:43,391
He is Ronnie Middleton.

578
00:34:44,223 --> 00:34:45,056
Sounds like a dick.

579
00:34:47,417 --> 00:34:49,453
- He's a little child, okay?
- I'm sorry.

580
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:51,560
The point is that he's evil
in his core.

581
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,479
And there's nothing I can do.

582
00:35:03,295 --> 00:35:04,375
What's your greatest fear?

583
00:35:07,256 --> 00:35:07,995
That's change of tone.

584
00:35:08,342 --> 00:35:10,107
Yup. I am a really serious
person.

585
00:35:10,417 --> 00:35:10,856
Okay.

586
00:35:12,389 --> 00:35:14,606
Look, if it's too much, you can
just drink your drink.

587
00:35:15,684 --> 00:35:17,873
And live with the fact that
you're afraid.

588
00:35:18,034 --> 00:35:18,877
No, I can handle this.

589
00:35:24,628 --> 00:35:25,866
That I'll ruin Mary's
life.

590
00:35:37,933 --> 00:35:38,627
You're very...

591
00:35:40,486 --> 00:35:43,250
surprising, Mary's teacher.

592
00:35:44,044 --> 00:35:44,739
Very much so.

593
00:35:50,311 --> 00:35:52,620
- Just. Hold on. I'm sorry.
- What?

594
00:35:53,363 --> 00:35:53,988
Just so that...

595
00:35:54,841 --> 00:35:56,707
I feel that I need to
say this...

596
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:58,713
Just there's no misconception.

597
00:35:59,180 --> 00:35:59,849
No, I...

598
00:36:00,029 --> 00:36:00,573
No, hold on!

599
00:36:01,014 --> 00:36:04,452
That this can't,
isn't happening.

600
00:36:04,615 --> 00:36:06,276
I get it. I know, I'm with you.

601
00:36:06,485 --> 00:36:08,525
Yeah? Okay.
- 100%. We're on the same page.

602
00:36:08,725 --> 00:36:08,879
Good.

603
00:36:10,485 --> 00:36:12,571
No, that's great. I'm sorry.
That's embarassing.

604
00:36:13,684 --> 00:36:14,587
It's okay. I get it.

605
00:36:20,132 --> 00:36:22,033
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

606
00:36:22,149 --> 00:36:24,118
Okay. Good.

607
00:36:24,316 --> 00:36:25,607
Can you promise me that
there's no way?

608
00:36:25,752 --> 00:36:28,526
Yes. Roberta has Mary every
Saturday till noon, I promise.

609
00:36:28,539 --> 00:36:28,859
Yeah?

610
00:36:34,179 --> 00:36:34,623
Sorry.

611
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:37,680
I can't do this.

612
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:42,729
Okay.

613
00:36:44,339 --> 00:36:45,003
Okay.

614
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:47,328
I understand.

615
00:36:48,986 --> 00:36:49,861
I'll take you home.

616
00:36:50,161 --> 00:36:50,548
Yeah.

617
00:36:52,195 --> 00:36:53,952
Sorry, just... one more time.

618
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,168
I can't find my DVD.

619
00:37:13,951 --> 00:37:15,299
It's right there, baby.

620
00:37:15,992 --> 00:37:17,449
No, it isn't.
You come and find it.

621
00:37:17,761 --> 00:37:18,723
I'm doing lady business.

622
00:37:18,979 --> 00:37:21,146
And you were the last person
to watch it. What are you doing?

623
00:37:53,487 --> 00:37:54,615
Oh, my God!

624
00:38:04,319 --> 00:38:06,932
Good morning, Miss Stevenson.

625
00:38:08,514 --> 00:38:08,997
Hi.

626
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:12,379
Look, I am...

627
00:38:12,525 --> 00:38:13,990
You know what? i'm actually
incapable...

628
00:38:14,134 --> 00:38:15,363
of having this conversation right now.

629
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,057
Good, good. Cause I have no idea
what I was going to say.

630
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:21,193
Great! Perfect!

631
00:38:21,597 --> 00:38:24,228
Sir, if you please.
Take me to jail.

632
00:38:32,907 --> 00:38:34,022
Awkward.

633
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:36,209
Mary...

634
00:38:36,388 --> 00:38:37,151
Stop! Stop!

635
00:38:37,369 --> 00:38:39,603
Stop with the Legos. Listen.

636
00:38:39,812 --> 00:38:41,266
Do we have a rule about
Saturday morning?

637
00:38:41,782 --> 00:38:42,194
What?

638
00:38:43,148 --> 00:38:45,181
Are you allowed in this appartment
this early on Saturday morning?

639
00:38:45,977 --> 00:38:46,855
- No.
- No!

640
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:49,959
Are you allowed to... Hey!

641
00:38:50,223 --> 00:38:52,110
Stop! Enough with the Legos.

642
00:38:52,644 --> 00:38:54,049
Are you allowed to use
Roberta's keys?

643
00:38:54,591 --> 00:38:55,511
- No.
- No!

644
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:57,840
So, hey! Look at me.

645
00:38:58,544 --> 00:38:59,712
Then why are you here?

646
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:02,507
Can you answer me that?

647
00:39:03,077 --> 00:39:04,157
You broke every rule!

648
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:06,959
You just embarrassed me.

649
00:39:08,065 --> 00:39:09,027
We have these rules.

650
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:10,247
We've gone over them a hundred times!

651
00:39:12,441 --> 00:39:12,973
God!

652
00:39:13,962 --> 00:39:14,562
Damn it!

653
00:39:15,548 --> 00:39:17,149
Can I just get five minutes of my
own life?

654
00:39:45,744 --> 00:39:47,140
Nothing that happened today was your fault.

655
00:39:48,015 --> 00:39:48,652
I got mad at you...

656
00:39:49,669 --> 00:39:50,530
I was really mad at me.

657
00:39:52,344 --> 00:39:53,929
And the manufacturers
of Legos.

658
00:39:54,122 --> 00:39:55,175
They should all be in prison.

659
00:39:55,909 --> 00:39:56,223
So...

660
00:39:59,698 --> 00:40:00,181
I'm sorry.

661
00:40:03,064 --> 00:40:03,679
Do you forgive me?

662
00:40:05,509 --> 00:40:06,549
Sure. Whatever.

663
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:09,029
Hey, close the laptop.
Come on.

664
00:40:10,362 --> 00:40:12,275
Please. Doesn't count if it's
not eye to eye.

665
00:40:14,009 --> 00:40:14,847
Come on, please.

666
00:40:18,174 --> 00:40:19,969
Do you really have no life
because of me?

667
00:40:22,738 --> 00:40:23,647
That's not what I said.

668
00:40:26,691 --> 00:40:27,435
Did you mean it?

669
00:40:30,853 --> 00:40:32,881
Last week you said I was the
worst uncle in the world...

670
00:40:32,966 --> 00:40:35,150
and you wished the dead of me,
cause I didn't buy you a piano.

671
00:40:35,962 --> 00:40:36,651
Did you mean that?

672
00:40:38,708 --> 00:40:39,301
No.

673
00:40:40,297 --> 00:40:41,341
Not entirely.

674
00:40:44,321 --> 00:40:44,973
There you go.

675
00:40:45,365 --> 00:40:47,900
We say things all the time
we don't mean.

676
00:40:49,523 --> 00:40:50,546
let's forget it, okay?

677
00:40:53,078 --> 00:40:54,010
Okay.

678
00:40:54,773 --> 00:40:55,671
Okay.

679
00:40:59,641 --> 00:41:00,869
- Frank?
- Yeah?

680
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,564
- Can I have a piano?
- No.

681
00:41:06,018 --> 00:41:07,558
Was that really Mary's teacher this morning?

682
00:41:08,255 --> 00:41:10,700
You know I have a book called:
Fundamentals of Decision Making.

683
00:41:11,448 --> 00:41:12,216
You can borrow it.

684
00:41:20,801 --> 00:41:21,445
What is it?

685
00:41:23,149 --> 00:41:24,414
It's nothing.

686
00:41:24,999 --> 00:41:27,176
It's like Mary gets to go to Boston
for a couple days.

687
00:41:30,999 --> 00:41:32,117
It's just two days.

688
00:41:33,548 --> 00:41:34,312
Relax.

689
00:41:44,231 --> 00:41:45,321
So, what do you think?

690
00:41:46,511 --> 00:41:47,296
Cool.

691
00:42:00,238 --> 00:42:03,078
<font color=#FFFFFF>Wow! You and my mom...
were always together.</font>

692
00:42:04,904 --> 00:42:05,711
Always.

693
00:42:26,704 --> 00:42:28,295
Oh, no, you don't want to look
at that one.

694
00:42:28,918 --> 00:42:29,832
Is that you?

695
00:42:33,191 --> 00:42:34,042
Yes.

696
00:42:36,572 --> 00:42:37,599
How old were you?

697
00:42:38,151 --> 00:42:39,025
29.

698
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,357
Where is this?

699
00:42:42,137 --> 00:42:43,496
That's Cambridge University.

700
00:42:44,661 --> 00:42:45,481
In England.

701
00:42:51,198 --> 00:42:52,181
Who are those people?

702
00:42:52,627 --> 00:42:53,860
My research colleagues.

703
00:42:55,185 --> 00:42:55,947
For what?

704
00:42:56,316 --> 00:42:57,647
Mathematics, of course.

705
00:42:58,972 --> 00:42:59,574
Really?

706
00:43:02,302 --> 00:43:03,471
Cool!

707
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:08,674
So, then you came to work
at the college in America?

708
00:43:09,661 --> 00:43:10,402
No.

709
00:43:10,803 --> 00:43:12,699
I married your grandfather...

710
00:43:13,573 --> 00:43:15,208
and I came back to America with him.

711
00:43:16,932 --> 00:43:17,862
And I had children.

712
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:22,246
So, no more math?

713
00:43:25,284 --> 00:43:25,849
It's late.

714
00:43:26,311 --> 00:43:27,324
You've got a big day tomorrow.

715
00:43:28,362 --> 00:43:30,005
Come on. Up, up, up.

716
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:32,529
Can I play the piano?

717
00:43:32,646 --> 00:43:34,798
- No, you can't. Stop dragging those feet.
- But it's fun.

718
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:35,788
Come on.

719
00:43:36,932 --> 00:43:39,693
I have had a series of nightmares...

720
00:43:39,927 --> 00:43:41,929
where I'm fired...

721
00:43:43,373 --> 00:43:45,688
because of what happened.

722
00:43:46,771 --> 00:43:47,504
You get it?

723
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:51,635
And the I try to rationalize,
that everything that happened,

724
00:43:51,797 --> 00:43:53,150
was just alcohol.

725
00:43:58,129 --> 00:43:59,522
I have an addiction to fixer
guys.

726
00:44:14,154 --> 00:44:16,099
Dr. Shankland, this problem is...

727
00:44:16,334 --> 00:44:19,112
I know. Just copy it exactly as
you see it written.

728
00:44:19,432 --> 00:44:20,076
But it's...

729
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,526
Exactly as written. Thank you.

730
00:44:28,428 --> 00:44:30,620
So what's this problem I'm
supposed to look at?

731
00:44:31,185 --> 00:44:31,826
I don't know.

732
00:44:32,854 --> 00:44:34,857
So, it's like a problem
mom worked on?

733
00:44:35,265 --> 00:44:36,748
Your mother didn't work
on problems.

734
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:39,034
She worked on just
one problem.

735
00:44:39,592 --> 00:44:40,388
Just one?

736
00:44:41,552 --> 00:44:42,621
Her entire life?

737
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:43,950
Most of it.

738
00:44:45,507 --> 00:44:45,983
Look.

739
00:44:47,734 --> 00:44:49,885
These are Millennium problems.

740
00:44:51,452 --> 00:44:53,727
Seven great and meaningful
problems.

741
00:44:54,744 --> 00:44:58,366
Some mathematicians have worked
their entire lives to prove them.

742
00:44:58,787 --> 00:45:00,414
Who's the dude with the beard?

743
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:02,125
That's not a dude.

744
00:45:02,767 --> 00:45:04,257
That's Grigori Perelman.

745
00:45:04,981 --> 00:45:06,770
He proved Poincare
conjecture.

746
00:45:07,388 --> 00:45:09,027
The only one of the seven
proved.

747
00:45:10,699 --> 00:45:11,342
This...

748
00:45:13,524 --> 00:45:15,560
This is your mother's
problem.

749
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:18,638
Na...vi...

750
00:45:18,896 --> 00:45:19,939
Navier- Stokes.

751
00:45:22,689 --> 00:45:23,600
No picture.

752
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:25,906
- She didn't solve it?
- No.

753
00:45:27,203 --> 00:45:28,015
She was close.

754
00:45:29,871 --> 00:45:31,730
She would have won
Fields Medal...

755
00:45:32,489 --> 00:45:34,061
and probably shared the Nobel.

756
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:36,075
considering what would
meant for physics.

757
00:45:36,732 --> 00:45:39,092
Maybe I'll have my picture
up here someday.

758
00:45:45,538 --> 00:45:47,007
If you really desire it...

759
00:45:47,393 --> 00:45:49,218
you can have your picture
there, darling.

760
00:45:49,994 --> 00:45:50,865
I can help you.

761
00:45:52,358 --> 00:45:55,533
It takes focus and hard
work, but if you succeed...

762
00:45:56,975 --> 00:45:59,116
your name will live forever.

763
00:46:09,735 --> 00:46:11,001
Don't be smug, Seymore.

764
00:46:11,965 --> 00:46:13,328
Well, she's had plenty
of time.

765
00:46:13,991 --> 00:46:16,879
She traveled yesterday, she
slept in a strange bed.

766
00:46:17,952 --> 00:46:18,903
Give her a chance.

767
00:46:22,617 --> 00:46:24,572
At six years old, she read Zimmer.

768
00:46:25,983 --> 00:46:26,905
Outstanding.

769
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:29,083
How much did she comprehend?

770
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:32,640
So, Mary...

771
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:36,047
I see you're looking at
our little problem.

772
00:46:37,084 --> 00:46:38,998
Little? It's big.

773
00:46:39,976 --> 00:46:40,535
Yeah.

774
00:46:46,797 --> 00:46:48,551
Why are you so mad all of
the sudden?

775
00:46:48,842 --> 00:46:50,264
I'm not mad, I'm
annoyed.

776
00:46:50,804 --> 00:46:53,958
Not with you, darlin'. With that
pompes ass, Shankland.

777
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:57,381
I knew that guy was gonna have
a beard, before we even went in there.

778
00:46:57,748 --> 00:46:59,202
Math teachers like to grow
beards.

779
00:46:59,793 --> 00:47:01,814
I should never have agreed
to this.

780
00:47:02,172 --> 00:47:05,055
Did he reallly expect you to just
walk in and be able to dissect...

781
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,892
some random massive
problem?

782
00:47:07,341 --> 00:47:08,860
Not much to dissect, if
you ask me.

783
00:47:10,201 --> 00:47:11,595
Why? Why do you say that?

784
00:47:12,012 --> 00:47:12,764
It was wrong.

785
00:47:13,444 --> 00:47:14,107
What?

786
00:47:14,787 --> 00:47:18,688
Well...for starters, he forgot
the negative sign on the exponent.

787
00:47:19,027 --> 00:47:20,484
It went downhill
from there.

788
00:47:21,288 --> 00:47:22,711
The problem was
unsolvable.

789
00:47:23,876 --> 00:47:26,443
Maybe this school isn't as
great as you think it is.

790
00:48:37,222 --> 00:48:39,859
Mary, you knew that the problem
was incorect, why didn't you say anything?

791
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,627
Frank says I'm not supposed to correct
older people.

792
00:48:44,727 --> 00:48:46,133
Nobody like a smart-ass.

793
00:48:54,142 --> 00:48:55,901
I'm loaded with swag!

794
00:49:04,101 --> 00:49:05,075
Wanna come inside?

795
00:49:07,183 --> 00:49:07,704
Cat.

796
00:49:09,201 --> 00:49:11,019
Frank, I think this is stupid.

797
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:14,700
Why don't we just call Evelyn and
tell her I don't wanna do this?

798
00:49:15,033 --> 00:49:17,307
Cause as I told you, Evelyn didn't
order this. The court did.

799
00:49:17,808 --> 00:49:19,220
So again, what we are gonna do?

800
00:49:19,462 --> 00:49:20,170
Tell the truth.

801
00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:20,936
Exactly.

802
00:49:21,362 --> 00:49:23,693
Sonner we answer these questions,
sonner we get to go home.

803
00:49:23,849 --> 00:49:24,987
So, no attitude, okay?

804
00:49:25,347 --> 00:49:25,866
Okay.

805
00:49:28,731 --> 00:49:29,320
Frank?

806
00:49:30,149 --> 00:49:30,735
Mary.

807
00:49:32,539 --> 00:49:33,266
I like Evelyn.

808
00:49:34,107 --> 00:49:35,045
She looks like my mom.

809
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:36,715
And she has a piano.

810
00:49:41,529 --> 00:49:42,653
But I don't wanna live
with her.

811
00:49:43,923 --> 00:49:44,778
She's bossy.

812
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:47,121
I've heard that.

813
00:49:48,843 --> 00:49:49,480
Hey.

814
00:49:50,837 --> 00:49:52,903
Don't worry. You're not going
anywhere.

815
00:49:55,583 --> 00:49:56,438
Promise?

816
00:49:59,421 --> 00:50:00,142
I promise.

817
00:50:00,922 --> 00:50:03,933
Hi, Mary. I'm Pat Golding,
but you can call me Pat, if you like.

818
00:50:04,356 --> 00:50:04,946
Got it.

819
00:50:06,084 --> 00:50:06,947
Do you know why you're here?

820
00:50:07,926 --> 00:50:10,043
I mean, is anyone told you
what this is about?

821
00:50:10,398 --> 00:50:12,896
My grandmother wants me to live with her,
and I wanna stay with Frank.

822
00:50:13,262 --> 00:50:14,125
That's correct.

823
00:50:15,297 --> 00:50:18,279
I'm sure this is gonna be a very
scary stuff. Does any of it worry you?

824
00:50:19,342 --> 00:50:21,675
Nope. Frank says I'm not going
anywhere.

825
00:50:23,051 --> 00:50:24,606
Your uncle told you you're not
going anywhere?

826
00:50:24,854 --> 00:50:26,073
Just 15 minutes ago.

827
00:50:26,729 --> 00:50:27,420
So, are we done here?

828
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:30,012
Not quite yet.

829
00:50:31,173 --> 00:50:33,258
My best friend other than
Frank and Fred is Roberta,

830
00:50:33,458 --> 00:50:34,736
who lives a couple house away.

831
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:35,862
Really? What's she like?

832
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:38,651
She's nice and funny.
And I love her.

833
00:50:40,295 --> 00:50:40,898
That's nice.

834
00:50:41,824 --> 00:50:43,471
Is Roberta your only
friend your age?

835
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:47,295
Roberta's not my age. She's like
40, 50...

836
00:50:47,651 --> 00:50:48,378
30-something.

837
00:50:49,422 --> 00:50:50,428
Roberta's grown woman?

838
00:50:51,209 --> 00:50:52,697
People my age are boring.

839
00:50:53,436 --> 00:50:54,419
Roberta's cool.

840
00:50:56,041 --> 00:50:56,539
Okay.

841
00:50:56,778 --> 00:50:57,907
I don't watch TV.

842
00:50:58,236 --> 00:50:59,791
But I got hooked on
SpongeBob.

843
00:51:00,688 --> 00:51:02,222
Mostly because Roberta
loves it.

844
00:51:04,838 --> 00:51:07,130
And on Saturday nights we watch
the UFC.

845
00:51:07,484 --> 00:51:08,434
The UFC? Is that...

846
00:51:09,302 --> 00:51:10,503
Is that Ultimate Fighting?

847
00:51:10,915 --> 00:51:12,074
Every Saturday.

848
00:51:12,691 --> 00:51:14,570
You and your uncle watch
Ultimate Fighting?

849
00:51:15,044 --> 00:51:16,804
Well, you don't just
watch it.

850
00:51:17,484 --> 00:51:20,459
Frank turns the sound down,
and we do grounting voices.

851
00:51:22,519 --> 00:51:24,075
Sometimes I attack Frank
for real.

852
00:51:24,606 --> 00:51:26,135
Which is really fun for me.

853
00:51:26,824 --> 00:51:29,419
If you guys knew Frank,
you'd leave us alone.

854
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:34,643
He can be pretty annoying,
but he's a good person.

855
00:51:35,267 --> 00:51:35,953
I think.

856
00:51:37,575 --> 00:51:38,390
Why do you say that?

857
00:51:40,408 --> 00:51:41,913
He wanted me before I
was smart.

858
00:51:42,859 --> 00:51:44,351
Mr. Polland, are you the...

859
00:51:44,394 --> 00:51:46,481
natural father of Mary
Adler?

860
00:51:47,151 --> 00:51:48,335
Yes. Yes, I am.

861
00:51:48,837 --> 00:51:50,245
And how you can be certain of this?

862
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:53,722
Well, I always knew, but
then you had me...

863
00:51:53,858 --> 00:51:54,877
take a DNA test.

864
00:51:55,323 --> 00:51:58,223
I would offer that the test results has
result of evidence of that...

865
00:51:58,385 --> 00:52:02,141
Mr. Polland is the father and natural
guardian of the minor.

866
00:52:02,346 --> 00:52:04,062
As well as an affidavit...

867
00:52:04,262 --> 00:52:05,629
from Mr. Polland nominating...

868
00:52:05,833 --> 00:52:09,464
Mrs. Adler the maternial grandmother
as the legal guardian of the minor.

869
00:52:10,209 --> 00:52:11,288
No objections.

870
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:13,962
Mr. Polland...

871
00:52:15,198 --> 00:52:18,810
has Mrs. Adler offered you any
moneytory reward or...

872
00:52:18,944 --> 00:52:20,339
employment for coming forward today?

873
00:52:21,662 --> 00:52:23,796
No, sir. I have a job of
my own.

874
00:52:24,117 --> 00:52:25,989
Thank you. No further questions,
your Honor.

875
00:52:26,918 --> 00:52:27,662
Mr. Polland...

876
00:52:28,133 --> 00:52:29,802
when was the last time you
saw Mary?

877
00:52:32,299 --> 00:52:33,464
I've never seen her.

878
00:52:34,473 --> 00:52:35,126
Why not?

879
00:52:35,528 --> 00:52:36,832
By the time I heard about Diane...

880
00:52:38,032 --> 00:52:38,654
passing...

881
00:52:39,885 --> 00:52:41,403
the baby was gone already.

882
00:52:41,971 --> 00:52:43,238
Well, did you try and
find her?

883
00:52:45,052 --> 00:52:45,712
Best I could.

884
00:52:47,401 --> 00:52:49,317
I couldn't just go and search
the entire country.

885
00:52:49,681 --> 00:52:51,344
Do you use a computer at work?

886
00:52:51,639 --> 00:52:52,291
Sure.

887
00:52:52,656 --> 00:52:53,574
You know what?
Help me out.

888
00:52:56,296 --> 00:52:59,870
Let's google "Mary Adler"
and see what we find.

889
00:53:10,142 --> 00:53:10,772
You know what?

890
00:53:11,725 --> 00:53:12,974
You better add her middle name.

891
00:53:13,688 --> 00:53:14,569
It'll narrow it down.

892
00:53:19,833 --> 00:53:20,548
Eillen.

893
00:53:28,692 --> 00:53:30,271
Yeah, Hit enter.

894
00:53:31,477 --> 00:53:32,086
Page 2.

895
00:53:32,789 --> 00:53:33,360
Second hit.

896
00:53:34,541 --> 00:53:36,229
Would you please tell the court
what you see there?

897
00:53:37,096 --> 00:53:40,499
It's a newspaper article called:
Not so terrible twos.

898
00:53:40,715 --> 00:53:43,629
And one of them is Mary
Eileen Adler.

899
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:45,456
Same name as your daugter.

900
00:53:45,730 --> 00:53:48,182
Born on the same day
as your daughter.

901
00:53:48,632 --> 00:53:49,337
With a photograph.

902
00:53:50,562 --> 00:53:52,234
In your defense, you'd
never recognize it.

903
00:53:52,565 --> 00:53:53,651
- Your Honor, this is...
- Your Honor.

904
00:53:54,139 --> 00:53:56,591
If there's one thing here
that's sadly obvious it's that...

905
00:53:56,752 --> 00:54:00,244
Mr. Polland has never been a genuine
guardian of the minor

906
00:54:00,561 --> 00:54:03,653
and his nomination of Mrs. Adler is
no less disingenuous.

907
00:54:08,806 --> 00:54:11,896
While the state of Florida gets differents
to nomination by natural parent,

908
00:54:12,022 --> 00:54:13,904
I'm inclined to side with
Mr. Cullen's laptop

909
00:54:14,226 --> 00:54:14,818
at this time.

910
00:54:15,294 --> 00:54:16,205
Thank you, your Honor.

911
00:54:28,217 --> 00:54:28,881
Don't gloat.

912
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,098
Wouldn't dream of it.

913
00:54:30,996 --> 00:54:31,809
Walk you to your car?

914
00:54:32,125 --> 00:54:34,617
You been so proacipate,
I'm almost ashamed to ask.

915
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:35,655
How's Walter?

916
00:54:37,912 --> 00:54:39,557
You wouldn't believe it
if I told you.

917
00:54:39,876 --> 00:54:40,395
What?

918
00:54:40,957 --> 00:54:43,490
Well, your stepfather is
in Montana.

919
00:54:44,571 --> 00:54:45,668
He bought a ranch.

920
00:54:46,554 --> 00:54:47,195
Bullshit.

921
00:54:47,407 --> 00:54:50,135
Exactly. A man whose idea of
roughing it...

922
00:54:50,376 --> 00:54:52,849
is being too far from the
ice machine at the Rith's Carlton,

923
00:54:53,283 --> 00:54:56,186
now owns a 1000 acres of
grass and dung.

924
00:54:56,419 --> 00:54:58,373
Walter Price is a cowboy.

925
00:54:59,226 --> 00:55:02,065
Walter Price puts Brooke's brother
suit to take out the garbage.

926
00:55:02,344 --> 00:55:05,381
He has a cowboy hat and
cowboy boots...

927
00:55:05,697 --> 00:55:07,348
and a horse that doesn't know
dressage.

928
00:55:07,864 --> 00:55:09,445
Is there some logical reason
for this?

929
00:55:09,968 --> 00:55:11,388
Midlife crisis, apparently.

930
00:55:12,941 --> 00:55:13,595
He's 70.

931
00:55:14,103 --> 00:55:14,564
I know.

932
00:55:15,876 --> 00:55:17,449
Must have been on time
delay or something.

933
00:55:18,869 --> 00:55:22,318
I guess I should be happy it
wasn't 25 year old coctail waitress.

934
00:55:23,367 --> 00:55:26,088
But than again in affair you can
explain to friends in a minute.

935
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:29,531
For this, you put on a pot of coffee.

936
00:55:31,615 --> 00:55:32,648
And he's out there right now?

937
00:55:33,072 --> 00:55:34,282
Yessiree!

938
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:36,770
Ridin' the range.
Punchin' doggies.

939
00:55:37,579 --> 00:55:39,355
He had a six gun on
his hip...

940
00:55:39,892 --> 00:55:41,854
and a saddlebag full
of Lipitor.

941
00:55:43,947 --> 00:55:46,046
The fastest asset management
in the West.

942
00:55:47,203 --> 00:55:48,680
The man who shot Liberty
Mutual.

943
00:55:50,433 --> 00:55:51,655
That's what I've been
calling him.

944
00:55:55,411 --> 00:55:57,483
That's really, really funny.

945
00:56:05,973 --> 00:56:06,910
Take her to the airport.

946
00:56:10,613 --> 00:56:11,514
Go home, Evelyn.

947
00:56:12,457 --> 00:56:14,297
Or Montana. Rustle
some cattle.

948
00:56:16,675 --> 00:56:17,192
You know...

949
00:56:18,657 --> 00:56:20,293
I have no desire to
hurt you.

950
00:56:21,773 --> 00:56:23,079
I hate it that we're
at odds.

951
00:56:25,667 --> 00:56:26,505
We're always
at odds.

952
00:56:28,258 --> 00:56:28,962
Yes.

953
00:56:30,145 --> 00:56:30,846
Hotel.

954
00:56:35,064 --> 00:56:38,185
Mary, baby, come on now.
Stop this. Stop this now.

955
00:56:38,779 --> 00:56:39,338
No.

956
00:56:39,449 --> 00:56:40,491
Come on out, honey.

957
00:56:41,034 --> 00:56:41,678
No.

958
00:56:41,923 --> 00:56:43,830
Why did you have to tell her
that Ted was testifying?

959
00:56:43,897 --> 00:56:44,708
Because it's the truth.

960
00:56:44,863 --> 00:56:46,015
And if I didn't,
Evelyn would've.

961
00:56:46,186 --> 00:56:49,061
If I was the dad of a little girl
and I never saw her...

962
00:56:50,921 --> 00:56:52,165
and I was in the same town...

963
00:56:54,001 --> 00:56:54,948
I woull visit her.

964
00:56:55,484 --> 00:56:56,576
Well, I hope you're happy.

965
00:57:00,494 --> 00:57:02,330
He didn't even need directions.

966
00:57:03,511 --> 00:57:04,928
He could've followed
you here.

967
00:57:06,964 --> 00:57:08,682
Speaking of man who aren't
worth a damn.

968
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:17,396
Doesn't even wanna see what
I look like.

969
00:57:22,323 --> 00:57:22,882
All right.

970
00:57:23,653 --> 00:57:25,134
Put your shoes on.
We're going for a ride.

971
00:57:25,399 --> 00:57:26,010
You too.

972
00:57:26,918 --> 00:57:27,504
A ride?

973
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,154
What are we doing here?

974
00:57:31,167 --> 00:57:31,770
Waiting.

975
00:57:32,918 --> 00:57:33,710
We can see that.

976
00:57:34,585 --> 00:57:35,254
Why?

977
00:57:36,072 --> 00:57:37,101
Because I said so.

978
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:41,680
How long do we have to
stay here?

979
00:57:42,751 --> 00:57:44,135
As long as it takes.

980
00:57:44,572 --> 00:57:46,635
And keep your voice down.
It's a hospital.

981
00:57:50,537 --> 00:57:54,574
- Food's here.
- Yeah, food is here. Okay.

982
00:59:08,468 --> 00:59:09,188
It's a boy.

983
00:59:16,285 --> 00:59:17,076
Way to go!

984
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:27,621
That's exactly how it was when you
were born.

985
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:30,698
This happy?

986
00:59:31,577 --> 00:59:32,268
This happy.

987
00:59:40,479 --> 00:59:42,238
Who came out and told everybody?

988
00:59:45,556 --> 00:59:46,046
I did.

989
00:59:55,444 --> 00:59:56,747
Can we stay for another?

990
01:00:45,877 --> 01:00:48,283
Mrs. Adler, in your earlier
testimony here today...

991
01:00:48,506 --> 01:00:50,491
you painted a pretty dim
picture of your son.

992
01:00:50,983 --> 01:00:51,548
Don't you think?

993
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:52,681
I'm under oath.

994
01:00:53,341 --> 01:00:54,637
I take no pleasure in it.

995
01:00:55,511 --> 01:00:58,772
So, your son is failer in life,
your daughter took her life.

996
01:00:58,863 --> 01:00:59,742
You know, you're oh for two.

997
01:01:00,083 --> 01:01:01,266
- Objection!
- Withdrawn.

998
01:01:01,431 --> 01:01:03,562
If I got one for three,
I'm in the Hall of Fame.

999
01:01:05,231 --> 01:01:06,100
You know baseball.

1000
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:08,076
Fanway Park.

1001
01:01:08,254 --> 01:01:09,716
You know, I'd like to go
there sometime.

1002
01:01:10,226 --> 01:01:13,769
How often in a year did
you take Diane to the baseball game?

1003
01:01:14,153 --> 01:01:15,591
Diane wasn't interested
in sports.

1004
01:01:15,737 --> 01:01:17,756
She never wanted to go to a game?
Ever?

1005
01:01:17,945 --> 01:01:19,584
I don't recall her ever
asking.

1006
01:01:19,947 --> 01:01:22,193
Just out of curiosity, Fenway,
that's a tough ticket.

1007
01:01:22,542 --> 01:01:23,706
Where do you get yours?

1008
01:01:24,036 --> 01:01:25,246
My husband has season tickets.

1009
01:01:25,381 --> 01:01:26,531
And how long has he
had them?

1010
01:01:26,809 --> 01:01:27,604
30 years.

1011
01:01:27,876 --> 01:01:29,672
But I've only been married
to him for 20.

1012
01:01:30,062 --> 01:01:31,628
And Diane never went to
one game?

1013
01:01:33,861 --> 01:01:35,869
What color was the dress Diane
wore to prom?

1014
01:01:36,148 --> 01:01:38,840
Diane didn't attend the prom,
Because she didn't attend the highschool.

1015
01:01:38,821 --> 01:01:39,439
No prom.

1016
01:01:39,678 --> 01:01:40,809
What sports did she play?

1017
01:01:41,017 --> 01:01:43,553
As I told you earlier, she
wasn't interested in sports.

1018
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:45,933
- Did she go to camp during the summer?
- No.

1019
01:01:45,991 --> 01:01:48,179
- Community swimming pool?
- We had our own pool.

1020
01:01:48,181 --> 01:01:49,201
- Girl Scouts?
- No.

1021
01:01:49,653 --> 01:01:52,734
Then what did she do with
all that time?

1022
01:01:53,179 --> 01:01:55,565
She loved the mathematics.
It was her passion.

1023
01:01:55,745 --> 01:01:57,674
She preferred it to all
other things.

1024
01:01:58,201 --> 01:01:58,976
All other?

1025
01:02:01,410 --> 01:02:03,788
Mrs. Adler, who's
Paul Riva?

1026
01:02:10,103 --> 01:02:11,285
He was a boy from the
neighbourhood.

1027
01:02:11,791 --> 01:02:15,225
Oh, come on. He was much more
than just a boy from the neighbourhood.

1028
01:02:15,768 --> 01:02:17,670
Paul was Diane's first love.
Wasn't he?

1029
01:02:18,469 --> 01:02:20,689
I wouldn't caracterize it that way, no.

1030
01:02:20,853 --> 01:02:22,540
And how would Diane
caracterize it?

1031
01:02:22,708 --> 01:02:24,549
Diane was 17 years old at the time.

1032
01:02:24,692 --> 01:02:26,012
She didn't know anything about
love.

1033
01:02:27,385 --> 01:02:28,052
Mrs. Adler...

1034
01:02:28,295 --> 01:02:30,258
In January in 1989...

1035
01:02:30,533 --> 01:02:33,085
didn't Diane and young
Mr. Riva run away together?

1036
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:34,054
He coerced her.

1037
01:02:34,193 --> 01:02:35,671
- And where did they go?
- Vermont.

1038
01:02:35,882 --> 01:02:37,413
- And you called the police, didn't you?
- Yes.

1039
01:02:37,618 --> 01:02:38,807
- Because he kidnapped her?
- Yes.

1040
01:02:38,956 --> 01:02:41,316
And where police found young
Mr. Riva and Diane?

1041
01:02:41,446 --> 01:02:42,446
I told you, Vermont.

1042
01:02:42,622 --> 01:02:43,904
Stowe, Vermont.
Wasn't it?

1043
01:02:44,531 --> 01:02:45,353
A resort town.

1044
01:02:45,648 --> 01:02:46,961
Stowe Mountain.

1045
01:02:47,733 --> 01:02:48,913
He took her skiing.

1046
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:52,983
You see, kidnappers don't usually
take their victims skiing.

1047
01:02:53,172 --> 01:02:56,027
But this is what Paul did...

1048
01:02:56,889 --> 01:02:59,468
because he and Diane were
in love.

1049
01:02:59,628 --> 01:03:00,138
No.

1050
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,723
And when they returned,
you pressed kidnapping charges.

1051
01:03:03,966 --> 01:03:06,802
you filed the lawsuit against
his parents...

1052
01:03:07,117 --> 01:03:09,127
until Paul stopped calling
Diane.

1053
01:03:09,379 --> 01:03:10,111
- Didn't you?
- Yes.

1054
01:03:10,269 --> 01:03:14,295
And Diane never heard of or
saw Paul Riva again.

1055
01:03:14,547 --> 01:03:15,076
Did she?

1056
01:03:15,238 --> 01:03:16,147
Not to my knowledge.

1057
01:03:19,047 --> 01:03:20,396
And how did she take it?

1058
01:03:21,581 --> 01:03:23,390
She was upset for a while.

1059
01:03:23,978 --> 01:03:24,928
She lost focus.

1060
01:03:26,242 --> 01:03:27,598
She lost focus.

1061
01:03:27,946 --> 01:03:30,596
Mrs. Adler, in March of 1999...

1062
01:03:30,828 --> 01:03:32,982
Didn't Diane Adler attempt to
take her own life?

1063
01:03:35,136 --> 01:03:35,136
This episode was minor.
It was nothing.

1064
01:03:35,323 --> 01:03:37,628
I have the hospital
report in my hand.

1065
01:03:37,806 --> 01:03:38,772
It was nothing.

1066
01:03:39,262 --> 01:03:40,929
Diane was not like
regular people.

1067
01:03:41,675 --> 01:03:42,627
She was extrodinary.

1068
01:03:42,989 --> 01:03:46,038
And extrodinary people come with
singular issues and needs.

1069
01:03:46,774 --> 01:03:49,538
You have no idea of capability
she possesed.

1070
01:03:50,374 --> 01:03:51,167
One in a billion.

1071
01:03:51,713 --> 01:03:58,003
And you would say: " Fine, let's throw that away,
so the boy who cuts our yard can make sexy concrest.

1072
01:03:58,608 --> 01:04:01,393
Well maybe before you make that
decision, you stand in my shoes.

1073
01:04:02,083 --> 01:04:05,582
I had responsibilities, which are beyond
the mother-dauther relationship.

1074
01:04:06,002 --> 01:04:09,613
The greateest discoveries, which have
proved life on this planet...

1075
01:04:09,901 --> 01:04:12,744
have come from minds rarer
than radium.

1076
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:15,148
Without them, we'd still be
crawling in mud.

1077
01:04:15,833 --> 01:04:18,301
And for your information,
conselor...

1078
01:04:18,519 --> 01:04:21,079
a year after this incident with
this boy...

1079
01:04:21,275 --> 01:04:23,249
Diane thanked me for my
intervention.

1080
01:04:23,793 --> 01:04:25,688
She realized she'd made a mistake and
she thanked me.

1081
01:04:26,358 --> 01:04:29,288
You see, Diane understood. She's been a
contible for a gift she'd been given.

1082
01:04:29,348 --> 01:04:30,741
And she didn't shy from it.

1083
01:04:31,006 --> 01:04:33,563
And I think, if she were here today,
Mr. Atorney,

1084
01:04:33,741 --> 01:04:38,972
she would refute your baseless insinuations, that she
would give up her brilliant future and take her own life

1085
01:04:39,162 --> 01:04:41,979
just because her mummy didn't get
her a little red wagon.

1086
01:04:45,062 --> 01:04:45,955
No more questions.

1087
01:05:21,428 --> 01:05:21,995
Mr. Adler...

1088
01:05:23,437 --> 01:05:25,079
Where are you currently
employed?

1089
01:05:25,319 --> 01:05:25,950
I repair boats.

1090
01:05:26,148 --> 01:05:27,339
Oh, really?
At which marina?

1091
01:05:27,993 --> 01:05:30,010
I don't work at the marina.
I freelance.

1092
01:05:29,904 --> 01:05:31,652
So, safe to say, no health
insurance.

1093
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:32,411
No.

1094
01:05:33,101 --> 01:05:34,829
About a week before your
sister took her life...

1095
01:05:35,257 --> 01:05:36,535
what were you doing for
a living then?

1096
01:05:37,475 --> 01:05:38,186
I was a teacher.

1097
01:05:38,761 --> 01:05:42,373
You're being modest, aren't you?
You were a professor at Boston University...

1098
01:05:42,502 --> 01:05:43,106
Isn't that right?

1099
01:05:43,305 --> 01:05:45,503
Yes, weel, assistant professor.

1100
01:05:45,726 --> 01:05:46,247
And what'd you teach?

1101
01:05:46,864 --> 01:05:47,603
Philosophy.

1102
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:49,885
Truth and logic. That sort
of thing.

1103
01:05:50,742 --> 01:05:52,672
Your attorney said that the
primary reason...

1104
01:05:52,853 --> 01:05:56,133
that you took Mary is because what your
sister would've wanted you to do.

1105
01:05:56,264 --> 01:05:57,343
Is that a truth?

1106
01:05:57,846 --> 01:05:58,220
Yes.

1107
01:05:58,598 --> 01:06:00,787
So Diane chad visited Pinellas
County before?

1108
01:06:02,071 --> 01:06:02,460
No.

1109
01:06:02,705 --> 01:06:04,911
Indicated she wanted her daughter
rooted and moved here?

1110
01:06:05,062 --> 01:06:05,358
No.

1111
01:06:05,681 --> 01:06:05,991
No.

1112
01:06:06,863 --> 01:06:09,295
So you decided to bring Mary
here, didn't you?

1113
01:06:10,452 --> 01:06:13,183
Did Diane had a problem with your
health plan at Boston University?

1114
01:06:13,594 --> 01:06:14,315
Not to my knowledge.

1115
01:06:14,334 --> 01:06:16,488
Do you think she would want her
dauther to have access to healthcare?

1116
01:06:16,632 --> 01:06:17,105
Of course.

1117
01:06:17,302 --> 01:06:19,429
So what do you do, when a little
Mary gets sick?

1118
01:06:20,282 --> 01:06:21,946
You repair a doctor's boat?

1119
01:06:22,076 --> 01:06:22,707
Objection.

1120
01:06:22,862 --> 01:06:23,533
Sustained.

1121
01:06:24,574 --> 01:06:27,488
Mary has been identified as
a math prodigy.

1122
01:06:27,810 --> 01:06:29,907
But her formal math education
under your care...

1123
01:06:30,208 --> 01:06:32,531
She's learning at the first grade level,
isn't she?

1124
01:06:32,695 --> 01:06:33,168
Yes.

1125
01:06:33,377 --> 01:06:35,734
And you turned out the scolarship
at the Oaks...

1126
01:06:35,908 --> 01:06:38,510
a school specialized for the education
of gifted children?

1127
01:06:39,448 --> 01:06:39,791
Yes.

1128
01:06:40,211 --> 01:06:41,931
And Diane, she'd be fine with that?

1129
01:06:44,115 --> 01:06:44,829
I couldn't say.

1130
01:06:45,189 --> 01:06:48,010
Prody to Mrs. Adler giving her one.
Did Mary have a computer?

1131
01:06:48,179 --> 01:06:48,863
She used mine.

1132
01:06:49,044 --> 01:06:51,406
Mr. Adler, does Diane's daughter
have her own bedroom?

1133
01:06:51,585 --> 01:06:51,844
No.

1134
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:53,935
Does she sleep in a bed that you bought...

1135
01:06:54,096 --> 01:06:55,457
- in a secondhand shop?
- Yes.

1136
01:06:55,544 --> 01:06:59,557
So, the truth is, Mr. Adler,
that you didn't come down here,

1137
01:06:59,672 --> 01:07:02,413
because your sister wanted it to,
and you certantly didn't come here

1138
01:07:02,567 --> 01:07:03,466
because it was good for Mary.

1139
01:07:03,672 --> 01:07:05,142
No, it was personal.

1140
01:07:05,543 --> 01:07:07,102
Diane was a star. You
weren't.

1141
01:07:07,253 --> 01:07:08,653
Diane got the attention.
You didn't.

1142
01:07:08,964 --> 01:07:11,559
Nobody use. You got angry.
And here comes Mary.

1143
01:07:11,695 --> 01:07:13,338
What a great way to get even.

1144
01:07:13,676 --> 01:07:16,750
You've uprooted that litlle girl and brought
her here for 1 reason only.

1145
01:07:17,081 --> 01:07:20,383
To do harm to your mother.
You blamed her for your sister.

1146
01:07:20,396 --> 01:07:20,754
No, I don't.

1147
01:07:20,916 --> 01:07:22,655
And Mary to you is just a paawn
in all this.

1148
01:07:22,821 --> 01:07:23,925
Diane wanted Mary...

1149
01:07:25,027 --> 01:07:25,952
to be a kid.

1150
01:07:27,645 --> 01:07:29,063
She wanted her to have a life.

1151
01:07:31,109 --> 01:07:32,555
She wanted her to have friends...

1152
01:07:33,628 --> 01:07:34,427
and to play...

1153
01:07:36,367 --> 01:07:37,192
and to be happy.

1154
01:07:37,315 --> 01:07:41,346
You realize the consequences of boredom
for a gifted child, Mr. Adler?

1155
01:07:41,614 --> 01:07:43,486
They become resentful and
sullen.

1156
01:07:43,882 --> 01:07:44,838
Mary's not an angry kid.

1157
01:07:45,038 --> 01:07:45,523
Really?

1158
01:07:45,939 --> 01:07:47,966
Did she not attack a child
on the school bus?

1159
01:07:48,601 --> 01:07:51,013
A 12 year old tripped a 7 year old and
she came to his defense.

1160
01:07:51,140 --> 01:07:52,895
- Did she brake the boy's nose?
- Yes.

1161
01:07:53,072 --> 01:07:56,681
On October 16th last year, were you
arrested for assault?

1162
01:07:57,119 --> 01:07:58,175
Oh, my God.

1163
01:07:58,682 --> 01:08:00,143
You have to answer the question,
Mr. Adler.

1164
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:05,607
A drunk idiot attacked me and I
defended myself.

1165
01:08:05,831 --> 01:08:07,242
Did you spend the night in jail?

1166
01:08:09,126 --> 01:08:09,492
Yeah.

1167
01:08:09,847 --> 01:08:11,583
You are in way over your head here.

1168
01:08:11,984 --> 01:08:14,544
You're depriving that girl.
You're gambling with her future...

1169
01:08:14,761 --> 01:08:16,652
and now you being presented with
an opportunity...

1170
01:08:16,848 --> 01:08:19,082
- to do right by her?
- Does concil have a question for my client?

1171
01:08:19,212 --> 01:08:20,539
Take the high road, Mr. Adler...

1172
01:08:20,674 --> 01:08:22,213
- before she's rapidly damaged.
- Does concil have a question...

1173
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:24,405
- for my client or not?
- Yes, sir. I do have a question.

1174
01:08:26,999 --> 01:08:29,413
Tell us. Is your continued guardianship

1175
01:08:29,570 --> 01:08:31,935
really in the best interest
of this litlle girl?

1176
01:08:39,342 --> 01:08:39,926
Yes.

1177
01:08:41,158 --> 01:08:41,823
Yes, it is.

1178
01:08:42,638 --> 01:08:43,728
I have no further questions.

1179
01:08:51,622 --> 01:08:54,133
Mr. Jim Emeliot has come up with
a brand new Fred cheer.

1180
01:08:54,461 --> 01:08:56,873
Fred personally asked me if I
would tell you it.

1181
01:08:57,528 --> 01:08:58,292
Let's hear it.

1182
01:08:59,536 --> 01:09:02,527
S-O-C-K-I-T Sock it to me,
Freddy...

1183
01:09:02,776 --> 01:09:04,688
Sock it.

1184
01:09:06,377 --> 01:09:08,434
Sock it.

1185
01:09:12,290 --> 01:09:13,590
Tell R and D, they got a winner.

1186
01:09:13,843 --> 01:09:15,316
That's exactly what I said.

1187
01:09:17,027 --> 01:09:20,330
S-O-C-K-I-T. Sock it to me,
Freddy.

1188
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:23,804
They wanna cut a deal.

1189
01:09:26,838 --> 01:09:28,731
Highsmith called me first thing
this morning.

1190
01:09:28,872 --> 01:09:30,336
Why would he do that?
I don't understand.

1191
01:09:31,844 --> 01:09:33,630
Just listen. Listen to me, man.

1192
01:09:36,860 --> 01:09:40,589
- Mary would be put in fostering situation.
- No.

1193
01:09:41,329 --> 01:09:41,636
Come on, Frank.

1194
01:09:42,050 --> 01:09:44,712
- It wouldn't be a court-appointed foster family.
- Cullen, I told you no.

1195
01:09:45,439 --> 01:09:46,323
- Drop it!
- We can cherry pick...

1196
01:09:46,518 --> 01:09:47,824
from the cream of the crop.

1197
01:09:47,999 --> 01:09:49,087
Muturally approved.

1198
01:09:49,906 --> 01:09:50,882
Just hear me out.

1199
01:09:51,683 --> 01:09:52,391
Tampa.

1200
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:54,570
I insisted, and they agreed.

1201
01:09:54,710 --> 01:09:57,325
No more than a half an hour
from your front door.

1202
01:09:57,446 --> 01:09:59,303
Now, she would attend the Oaks.

1203
01:09:59,453 --> 01:10:00,438
It's a great school.

1204
01:10:01,159 --> 01:10:03,903
And visiting rights for the grandmother,
but she was gonna get that anyway.

1205
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:07,562
Right. And on her 12th birthday, Frank
she can go back into court...

1206
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:08,800
- No.
- And decide then...

1207
01:10:09,241 --> 01:10:11,077
where she wants to live and who.

1208
01:10:11,239 --> 01:10:13,269
You supposed to be on my team.
Why are you bringing me this deal?

1209
01:10:13,421 --> 01:10:15,123
Other than I'm required to
by a law?

1210
01:10:15,385 --> 01:10:16,249
You like this deal?

1211
01:10:18,361 --> 01:10:19,498
I love this deal.

1212
01:10:36,974 --> 01:10:37,872
They think they're gonna lose.

1213
01:10:39,025 --> 01:10:39,387
Yeah.

1214
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:41,164
They do.

1215
01:10:43,051 --> 01:10:44,200
You think we're gonna lose.

1216
01:10:44,812 --> 01:10:45,521
Yes.

1217
01:10:46,029 --> 01:10:46,792
I do, Frank.

1218
01:10:54,928 --> 01:10:56,978
I gotta go put my kids to bed.

1219
01:10:58,969 --> 01:11:00,512
I'll do whatever you want me to do.

1220
01:11:01,896 --> 01:11:04,210
But, if we leave this up to
that judge...

1221
01:11:04,704 --> 01:11:07,271
Nick knows, he's a old school,
Frank.

1222
01:11:07,374 --> 01:11:09,492
Does he like your mother? No.

1223
01:11:09,637 --> 01:11:10,791
Does he like her income?

1224
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:13,684
Does he like her health plan?
Does he like her home?

1225
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:15,087
You better believe it.

1226
01:11:16,130 --> 01:11:17,408
I've been in his courtroom.

1227
01:11:17,919 --> 01:11:19,033
A hundred times.

1228
01:11:20,596 --> 01:11:21,841
And if it's a coin toss...

1229
01:11:22,422 --> 01:11:22,982
Look at me.

1230
01:11:26,346 --> 01:11:28,358
If it's a coin toss...

1231
01:11:29,214 --> 01:11:32,318
that old boy is going
to side with the money.

1232
01:11:33,778 --> 01:11:35,217
So, do me a favor, Frank.

1233
01:11:35,866 --> 01:11:38,082
Just meet the family.
See how it feels.

1234
01:11:38,593 --> 01:11:39,589
It's all I ask.

1235
01:11:53,550 --> 01:11:59,966
d Fly away litlle prety bird d

1236
01:12:01,412 --> 01:12:05,930
d Fly. Fly away d

1237
01:12:06,874 --> 01:12:07,939
Pool. Florida.

1238
01:12:08,071 --> 01:12:11,467
- d Fly away... d
- That dock is on the Intercoastal.

1239
01:12:12,414 --> 01:12:13,745
- Which I guess is obvious...
- d Little pretty... d

1240
01:12:14,448 --> 01:12:16,454
- Since we're on the Intercoastal.
- d...Bird. d

1241
01:12:18,758 --> 01:12:21,190
- Added this desk, so she could do homework.
- d And pretty...

1242
01:12:21,390 --> 01:12:24,162
- Yeah.
- d And pretty you'll always stay. d

1243
01:12:26,426 --> 01:12:32,623
d I see in your eyes, I promise d

1244
01:12:33,378 --> 01:12:35,505
So, while I'm trying to sell you
on the house...

1245
01:12:36,344 --> 01:12:37,330
and us...

1246
01:12:38,012 --> 01:12:41,123
I just don't want you to think that
we're completely insesitive...

1247
01:12:41,385 --> 01:12:42,461
to what the feeling.

1248
01:12:43,165 --> 01:12:51,173
d But fly away little pretty bird d

1249
01:12:53,263 --> 01:12:54,916
You guys gonna be okay with the cat?

1250
01:12:57,539 --> 01:12:58,437
Absolutely.

1251
01:13:01,215 --> 01:13:07,826
d Loves own tender flame warms this
meeting. d

1252
01:13:09,551 --> 01:13:15,437
d And loves tender song you'll sing d

1253
01:13:17,267 --> 01:13:20,013
d But fly away... d

1254
01:13:20,365 --> 01:13:22,872
I've been thinking a lot about the
word called " compromise".

1255
01:13:23,878 --> 01:13:26,379
On one hand, good challenging scool...

1256
01:13:27,270 --> 01:13:28,014
on the other...

1257
01:13:28,915 --> 01:13:29,916
foster people.

1258
01:13:30,471 --> 01:13:31,959
They can watch sitcoms with her.

1259
01:13:32,323 --> 01:13:33,415
Take her to Olive Garden.

1260
01:13:34,199 --> 01:13:35,787
Teach her to say:
"irregardless."

1261
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:39,964
The only saving grace is, I suppose,
that she is better off than she was.

1262
01:13:46,656 --> 01:13:47,705
Goodbye, Frank.

1263
01:14:02,928 --> 01:14:03,465
Come on.

1264
01:14:04,491 --> 01:14:06,177
I'm only 25 minutes away.

1265
01:14:06,535 --> 01:14:07,803
Please don't leave me here.

1266
01:14:08,308 --> 01:14:09,306
- Please.
- No.

1267
01:14:11,351 --> 01:14:13,497
You're going to a brand new school.
A better school.

1268
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:14,960
I don't want to.

1269
01:14:15,714 --> 01:14:16,785
I want my crummy school.

1270
01:14:16,961 --> 01:14:17,765
- And you got Fred.
- Please.

1271
01:14:18,211 --> 01:14:20,718
And once a month you can come back and
stay with me and Roberta.

1272
01:14:20,858 --> 01:14:22,224
I want you and Roberta now!

1273
01:14:22,898 --> 01:14:24,320
And in a few years, if you want...

1274
01:14:24,569 --> 01:14:26,206
You can come back. You
can live with me.

1275
01:14:26,475 --> 01:14:27,585
I wanna stay with you.

1276
01:14:28,193 --> 01:14:29,565
Frank, you promised me.

1277
01:14:29,772 --> 01:14:31,676
- Come on. Don't do this.
- You promised me.

1278
01:14:31,958 --> 01:14:32,415
I know.

1279
01:14:33,630 --> 01:14:34,208
I know.

1280
01:14:35,153 --> 01:14:37,668
Please, Frank. Why are you leaving me?

1281
01:14:37,931 --> 01:14:40,582
Because the court said I have to.
You know this.

1282
01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:41,982
We've discussed this ad naus...

1283
01:14:44,764 --> 01:14:47,168
We've discussed this.
Come on.

1284
01:14:48,844 --> 01:14:50,279
- Come on. Please.
- No!

1285
01:14:50,990 --> 01:14:52,009
- Hey, Mary.
- No!

1286
01:14:51,989 --> 01:14:52,652
Hey, Mary.

1287
01:14:53,158 --> 01:14:54,466
No! No!

1288
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:55,268
Sweetheart, you know what?

1289
01:14:55,666 --> 01:14:56,282
No!

1290
01:14:56,757 --> 01:14:57,989
There's no easy way to do this.

1291
01:14:58,363 --> 01:15:00,308
Not gonna be as long as
you think, honey.

1292
01:15:00,452 --> 01:15:01,298
- Frank.
- You're gonna see.

1293
01:15:01,590 --> 01:15:02,867
Frank!

1294
01:15:03,154 --> 01:15:04,247
Don't leave me!

1295
01:15:04,727 --> 01:15:11,488
- I know this is hard.
- Please!

1296
01:15:11,759 --> 01:15:12,902
- Come back!
- Mary! I know.

1297
01:15:13,499 --> 01:15:14,079
No!

1298
01:15:14,931 --> 01:15:15,583
Frank!

1299
01:15:16,890 --> 01:15:17,877
Don't go!

1300
01:15:19,764 --> 01:15:20,710
I need you!

1301
01:15:21,492 --> 01:15:22,784
Fred needs you!

1302
01:15:24,189 --> 01:15:25,028
You promised me!

1303
01:15:31,715 --> 01:15:32,514
No!

1304
01:15:53,956 --> 01:16:03,955
d Where the cold winter winds don't blow d

1305
01:16:10,831 --> 01:16:11,436
Hey, down there.

1306
01:16:14,796 --> 01:16:16,128
I don't know which mistake
is worst.

1307
01:16:16,529 --> 01:16:19,904
Designing a water pump that leaks
or putting it someone no human being can reach.

1308
01:16:24,628 --> 01:16:26,736
How you design something you
know it's gonna fail?

1309
01:16:28,493 --> 01:16:30,751
Gotta be devious or clueless,
right?

1310
01:16:36,297 --> 01:16:39,623
After the first few weeks, I knew
I had to find a real family for her.

1311
01:16:43,177 --> 01:16:44,377
I was in way over my head.

1312
01:16:48,925 --> 01:16:51,032
And every day I'd say:
"Today's the day"...

1313
01:16:52,214 --> 01:16:53,871
" I'm taking her to child services."

1314
01:16:54,099 --> 01:16:56,316
And every day she'd do
something just...

1315
01:17:00,177 --> 01:17:01,899
so unbelievably cool.

1316
01:17:04,011 --> 01:17:06,152
Her little personality was exploding.

1317
01:17:08,544 --> 01:17:09,289
She was funny.

1318
01:17:10,884 --> 01:17:13,134
And she was angry, and she was happy,
and she was...

1319
01:17:14,745 --> 01:17:15,506
Sad.

1320
01:17:17,353 --> 01:17:18,096
And was cute.

1321
01:17:18,738 --> 01:17:21,346
Just so damn entertaining.

1322
01:17:22,411 --> 01:17:23,397
And so I kept her.

1323
01:17:24,318 --> 01:17:27,700
Not that that's in her best interest.
Not that I'm capable of raising a child.

1324
01:17:28,691 --> 01:17:32,243
A child that might still have a mother if I'd taken
the time to notice she needed me.

1325
01:17:34,884 --> 01:17:37,169
And now, six and a half years later...

1326
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:40,343
I finally got her to a foster family
and you know what?

1327
01:17:41,223 --> 01:17:43,005
It was great. She loved it.

1328
01:17:44,005 --> 01:17:47,361
I thought it would be a nightmare
of abandonment and betrayal.

1329
01:17:47,439 --> 01:17:48,867
And it turns out it was
a huge success.

1330
01:17:50,829 --> 01:17:51,827
I'm fucking hero.

1331
01:17:57,771 --> 01:17:58,981
- Frank...
- No, Bonnie...

1332
01:18:00,266 --> 01:18:01,636
I appreciate everything you've done.

1333
01:18:02,343 --> 01:18:02,912
Just...

1334
01:18:21,559 --> 01:18:22,882
- Hey.
- Hi, Frank.

1335
01:18:25,405 --> 01:18:27,217
We're having a little bit of a problem
in there.

1336
01:18:27,685 --> 01:18:28,170
What?

1337
01:18:29,106 --> 01:18:29,859
Mary's fine...

1338
01:18:30,237 --> 01:18:32,454
but she's having a little bit
of a meltdown.

1339
01:18:33,550 --> 01:18:35,579
Right. Let me taalk to her.

1340
01:18:35,729 --> 01:18:36,883
No, hang on.

1341
01:18:37,901 --> 01:18:38,927
That's not a good idea.

1342
01:18:40,562 --> 01:18:43,399
Your visit here is the reason
for the meltdown.

1343
01:18:43,834 --> 01:18:44,257
What?

1344
01:18:46,130 --> 01:18:47,147
She don't wanna see you.

1345
01:18:53,095 --> 01:18:54,080
I'm sorry, man.

1346
01:18:55,311 --> 01:18:56,585
This is predictable.

1347
01:18:56,956 --> 01:18:58,577
You know, she needs time.

1348
01:19:04,747 --> 01:19:06,078
Just give me 5 minutes with her.

1349
01:19:06,765 --> 01:19:11,191
I let you inside and then
we're gonna betray her trust and have
even bigger problem.

1350
01:20:13,885 --> 01:20:15,973
ADOPTABLE PETS

1351
01:21:31,041 --> 01:21:32,359
- Hi!
- Hi! Can we help you?

1352
01:21:32,547 --> 01:21:34,671
Yeah. Do you have a one-eyed orange
cat named Fred?

1353
01:21:36,754 --> 01:21:39,481
We have a one-eyed cat.
But I don't know what his name is.

1354
01:21:39,639 --> 01:21:40,639
Where?

1355
01:21:41,003 --> 01:21:42,896
I don't know. Today was his last day.

1356
01:21:45,836 --> 01:21:47,119
Hey, you can't go back there.

1357
01:21:55,289 --> 01:21:56,300
What are you doing back here?

1358
01:22:00,005 --> 01:22:01,118
I told him he couldn't.

1359
01:22:06,642 --> 01:22:07,492
Hey, Fred.

1360
01:22:10,701 --> 01:22:11,620
Who brought this cat?

1361
01:22:12,326 --> 01:22:14,469
Some guy. He said it was an allergy
issue.

1362
01:22:17,686 --> 01:22:18,302
Evelyn.

1363
01:22:59,585 --> 01:23:00,553
Frank?
- Where's Evelyn?

1364
01:23:01,001 --> 01:23:02,252
Evelyn? You mean your mother?

1365
01:23:02,492 --> 01:23:03,364
- Yes.
- Kevin.

1366
01:23:04,101 --> 01:23:05,234
Evelyn is in the guest house.

1367
01:23:05,559 --> 01:23:07,241
Yeah, listen.
I'm sorry, man.

1368
01:23:07,699 --> 01:23:11,064
Frank, let me tell you.
She was so helpful with the tutors.

1369
01:23:11,244 --> 01:23:12,268
- Mary was so distant.
- Hey!

1370
01:23:12,466 --> 01:23:14,280
Look, we know what you have against.
Do you want your life back?

1371
01:23:14,649 --> 01:23:15,356
Go back inside.

1372
01:23:20,458 --> 01:23:21,407
What are you doing here?

1373
01:23:23,945 --> 01:23:25,053
Come on, Mary. We're
going home.

1374
01:23:25,370 --> 01:23:26,196
No.

1375
01:23:26,434 --> 01:23:27,754
You're trespassing!

1376
01:23:29,771 --> 01:23:30,546
You need to look at this.

1377
01:23:31,535 --> 01:23:32,086
Let's go, Mary.

1378
01:23:32,361 --> 01:23:33,088
- Let's move. Come on.
- No!

1379
01:23:33,292 --> 01:23:34,984
- Hey, Mary!
- Mary!

1380
01:23:36,395 --> 01:23:37,637
It's okay. I got her.

1381
01:23:40,238 --> 01:23:41,012
Think again, lady.

1382
01:23:56,461 --> 01:24:00,879
A COMPLETE PROOF OF THE EXISTENCE
AND SMOOTHNESS OF THE NAVIER-STOKES EQUATION
Diane E. Adler

1383
01:24:03,892 --> 01:24:04,346
Mary!

1384
01:24:05,288 --> 01:24:07,125
Mary! Hey, stop it!

1385
01:24:07,498 --> 01:24:08,616
No, let me go!

1386
01:24:09,104 --> 01:24:09,536
No!

1387
01:24:10,126 --> 01:24:11,675
- No, no!
- Stop, Mary.

1388
01:24:11,814 --> 01:24:13,241
- Stop, stop!
- No!

1389
01:24:13,467 --> 01:24:14,535
- Come here.
- You lied to me.

1390
01:24:15,093 --> 01:24:15,664
I know.

1391
01:24:15,954 --> 01:24:18,197
- No, no!
- Stop, stop, stop!

1392
01:24:18,799 --> 01:24:19,589
I'm sorry.

1393
01:24:20,127 --> 01:24:22,820
I made a mistake.
I'm so sorry.

1394
01:24:23,006 --> 01:24:23,966
You promised me.

1395
01:24:24,251 --> 01:24:24,800
I know.

1396
01:24:25,382 --> 01:24:26,097
You promised.

1397
01:24:26,449 --> 01:24:28,049
I know. I'm sorry.

1398
01:24:29,857 --> 01:24:31,397
You said you wouldn't leave me.

1399
01:24:31,570 --> 01:24:32,542
I made a mistake.

1400
01:24:34,732 --> 01:24:35,432
I'm sorry.

1401
01:24:39,181 --> 01:24:40,483
I was so sad!

1402
01:24:42,233 --> 01:24:43,185
I missed you.

1403
01:24:43,451 --> 01:24:44,397
I missed you, too.

1404
01:24:46,346 --> 01:24:47,479
They took Fred.

1405
01:24:47,950 --> 01:24:48,468
No.

1406
01:24:48,748 --> 01:24:49,456
It's okay.

1407
01:24:50,546 --> 01:24:51,631
I got him. He's home.

1408
01:24:52,430 --> 01:24:53,100
What?

1409
01:24:53,329 --> 01:24:55,215
He's at the apartment right now.
I got him.

1410
01:24:56,767 --> 01:24:57,465
For real?

1411
01:24:57,477 --> 01:25:00,497
Yeah, he's home kicking around his
ping pong ball.

1412
01:25:02,133 --> 01:25:03,541
Why did you leave me there?

1413
01:25:05,649 --> 01:25:07,267
Because I thought I was bad
for you.

1414
01:25:08,867 --> 01:25:09,878
And then it dawned on me.

1415
01:25:10,467 --> 01:25:12,353
If Mary is this amazing...

1416
01:25:12,931 --> 01:25:15,219
smart, sweet human being...

1417
01:25:16,152 --> 01:25:17,479
then I must be doing something right.

1418
01:25:26,132 --> 01:25:27,138
You're smilling.

1419
01:25:39,665 --> 01:25:40,341
Roberta!

1420
01:25:42,342 --> 01:25:42,973
Baby.

1421
01:25:43,251 --> 01:25:44,768
Of all the stunts you could pull.

1422
01:25:46,028 --> 01:25:48,135
- Where are they going?
- Nowhere. Not yet.

1423
01:25:49,749 --> 01:25:50,932
You two, out!

1424
01:25:57,278 --> 01:25:58,144
- What is this?
- Do you want to know...

1425
01:25:58,341 --> 01:25:59,372
how Diane told me she finished?

1426
01:25:59,662 --> 01:26:01,616
What is this unconscionable lie?

1427
01:26:01,755 --> 01:26:04,080
I walked in the appartment and she was
sitting on the floor...

1428
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:06,720
with that baby in her arms and you know what she said to me?
- Admit it.

1429
01:26:06,838 --> 01:26:07,648
You made this up.

1430
01:26:07,768 --> 01:26:09,310
- She said: "What do I do now?"
- No.

1431
01:26:09,552 --> 01:26:10,814
. It's not a completed proof...
It is.

1432
01:26:10,949 --> 01:26:13,350
No! It isn't! It can't be!

1433
01:26:13,465 --> 01:26:14,329
Evelyn, stop!

1434
01:26:16,127 --> 01:26:19,185
I'm taking Mary and I'm raising her how I
believe Diane would have wanted it.

1435
01:26:19,325 --> 01:26:20,299
- We'll see about this later.
- I realize...

1436
01:26:20,468 --> 01:26:23,767
She's not normal, but if Einstein can
ride a bike so can she.

1437
01:26:23,937 --> 01:26:26,198
Let just say Diane didn't tell me,
which is nonsense.

1438
01:26:26,525 --> 01:26:29,416
It's a Millenium Problem. She would
have shared it with the world.

1439
01:26:29,755 --> 01:26:31,246
That's where your charade falls apart.

1440
01:26:31,509 --> 01:26:34,538
If she would completed the proof,
she would have published it.

1441
01:26:37,708 --> 01:26:39,574
Diane instructed me very clearly.

1442
01:26:42,427 --> 01:26:44,220
That I was only o publish it
postmortem.

1443
01:26:44,952 --> 01:26:46,328
She died six years ago.

1444
01:26:49,295 --> 01:26:51,175
It wasn't her death she was
talking about.

1445
01:27:10,820 --> 01:27:12,114
I tried to talk her out of it.

1446
01:27:14,416 --> 01:27:17,172
But you know how Diane could be
whenshe made her mind up on something.

1447
01:27:19,317 --> 01:27:20,403
I called MIT.

1448
01:27:20,963 --> 01:27:23,848
Shankland's out of his mind about the possibility
of publishing it with you.

1449
01:27:25,222 --> 01:27:26,162
He's waiting for your call.

1450
01:27:27,612 --> 01:27:30,028
You're gonna spend the next few years
of your life defending it.

1451
01:27:31,594 --> 01:27:32,445
You won't have time for her.

1452
01:27:38,898 --> 01:27:39,784
What If I say no?

1453
01:27:46,803 --> 01:27:47,658
Back to Plan A.

1454
01:27:52,357 --> 01:27:53,253
Wait for me to die?

1455
01:27:59,006 --> 01:28:01,422
I know Diane was hard.

1456
01:28:05,137 --> 01:28:06,306
I know she was angry.

1457
01:28:07,874 --> 01:28:09,941
But something really good came out of this,
Evelyn.

1458
01:28:14,090 --> 01:28:14,963
She needs you now.

1459
01:28:16,484 --> 01:28:17,777
You're the best woman for a job.

1460
01:28:19,041 --> 01:28:19,514
Take it.

1461
01:28:25,340 --> 01:28:27,983
It doesn't seem like Diane wanted
me to have it.

1462
01:28:32,897 --> 01:28:34,250
Diane didn't always think things through.

1463
01:28:39,744 --> 01:28:40,442
I'll be outside.

1464
01:28:41,903 --> 01:28:42,854
Let me know what you wanna do.

1465
01:30:00,494 --> 01:30:03,000
You reached the Apartment of Mathematics,
MIT.

1466
01:30:04,050 --> 01:30:06,534
If you know your part in extension,
you may dial it anytime.

1467
01:30:08,835 --> 01:30:10,074
If you wish to speak to operator...

1468
01:30:10,545 --> 01:30:13,200
please stay in line and someone
would be with you as soon as possible.

1469
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:23,710
MIT Mathematics, how may I direct
your call?

1470
01:30:25,324 --> 01:30:27,684
Hello? I'm sorry. I can't hear
you wery well.

1471
01:30:27,761 --> 01:30:29,144
No! No.

1472
01:30:30,285 --> 01:30:31,615
Yeah. There you are.

1473
01:30:32,308 --> 01:30:33,018
Yeah, can I help you?

1474
01:30:33,901 --> 01:30:34,404
Yes.

1475
01:30:37,297 --> 01:30:38,413
Doctor Shankland.

1476
01:30:39,718 --> 01:30:41,566
I'm really sorry. I
can't hear you.

1477
01:30:41,781 --> 01:30:43,016
Could you speak up, please?

1478
01:30:46,518 --> 01:30:47,001
Hello?

1479
01:30:51,210 --> 01:30:52,326
Evelyn Adler...

1480
01:30:53,645 --> 01:30:55,382
for Seymore Shankland, please.

1481
01:30:57,525 --> 01:30:59,935
What I want you to notice is
when you compute P and N

1482
01:31:00,251 --> 01:31:01,971
for N congruent to four mod five...

1483
01:31:02,163 --> 01:31:04,654
the answer is a multiple of five.

1484
01:31:04,860 --> 01:31:07,852
The first person to notice this
was Romanujan.

1485
01:31:08,030 --> 01:31:09,371
In the beginning of 20th
century...

1486
01:31:09,652 --> 01:31:12,106
he proved that it was a case for all...

1487
01:31:12,274 --> 01:31:13,925
numbers congruent to four mod five.

1488
01:31:14,083 --> 01:31:16,994
So, he proved that P of five N
plus four...

1489
01:31:17,145 --> 01:31:18,554
is congruent to zero mod seven...

1490
01:31:19,386 --> 01:31:22,578
and P of eleven N plus six is
congruent...

1491
01:31:27,678 --> 01:31:28,136
Good?

1492
01:31:33,238 --> 01:31:34,987
You drive like an old lady.

1493
01:31:35,129 --> 01:31:36,398
It's Florida. I'm blending in.

1494
01:31:37,252 --> 01:31:37,868
How was school?

1495
01:31:39,714 --> 01:31:40,233
Fun.

1496
01:31:40,774 --> 01:31:42,223
Not like regular school fun.

1497
01:31:43,356 --> 01:31:44,147
But interesting.

1498
01:31:47,924 --> 01:31:48,831
What is this book?

1499
01:31:49,926 --> 01:31:52,659
Discourse on Method.
Rene Descartes.

1500
01:31:53,484 --> 01:31:54,217
What's it about?

1501
01:31:54,885 --> 01:31:55,621
Existence.

1502
01:31:56,507 --> 01:31:57,508
Existence?

1503
01:31:57,691 --> 01:31:59,772
Yup. " I think, therefore I am".

1504
01:32:01,159 --> 01:32:03,351
Well, of course you are.
That's obvious.

1505
01:32:06,757 --> 01:32:10,132
I think about Fred, therefore, I am.

1506
01:32:10,883 --> 01:32:12,115
Cogito ergo Fred?

1507
01:32:12,945 --> 01:32:15,474
He's a dude and he's a guy.

1508
01:32:16,463 --> 01:32:18,657
And he only has one eye.

1509
01:32:20,994 --> 01:32:23,772
Fred! Fred! Fred!

1510
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:25,930
Freedy, Fred, Fred!

1511
01:32:30,601 --> 01:32:31,490
All right, here we are.

1512
01:32:31,943 --> 01:32:33,832
Hey, wait till I come to
a stop.

1513
01:32:33,929 --> 01:32:35,407
Then come to a stop already!

1514
01:33:14,568 --> 01:33:23,014
THE END
