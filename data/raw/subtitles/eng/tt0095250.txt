1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:00,041
25.000

2
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,084
Jacques, come quick!

3
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:14,963
- It's shining!
- Quick, Jacques! It's shining in the harbour!

4
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,132
Quick!

5
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,281
There! You see it, Jacques?

6
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:25,241
(Jacques) It's a coin.

7
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,411
- It's mine! I saw it first!
- No, you liar!

8
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,289
- Liar! Liar!
- We'll see who's lying!

9
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,502
OK, I'll get it, but no fighting. All right?

10
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,797
- We'll split it.
- You can't split a coin. It's stupid.

11
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,092
- It's mine! I saw it!
- He's right! You're stupid!

12
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,762
Then we'll buy something and split that.

13
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,722
- OK?
- OK.

14
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,100
- OK?
- OK.

15
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,070
- Can you stop pointing? I've seen it.
- I've seen it, too.

16
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:15,667
Well, if it isn't the little Frenchman!
How is the little Frenchman?

17
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:18,712
Fine.

18
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:27,303
You don't mind if I go instead, do you?

19
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,597
No.

20
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,891
If you did mind, you'd tell me, no?

21
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:33,476
Yes.

22
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,524
Good.

23
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:43,069
Roberto, mio palmo!

24
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:47,157
(boy rakes deep brearhs)

25
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,418
Count!

26
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,837
(rakes huge brearh)

27
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,548
One! Two!

28
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,592
Three!

29
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,552
Four!

30
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:10,055
Five! Six!

31
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,224
Bravo, Enzo! Bravo, Enzo!

32
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:16,311
Viva Iralia! Bravo, Enzo!

33
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:30,241
Whose is it now?

34
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:32,911
You saw it, but I dove for it.

35
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:41,670
- Roberto, how long?
- Six!

36
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,838
I throw it back into the water.

37
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:47,425
You dive, and if you do less than six...

38
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,636
...it's yours.

39
00:07:58,436 --> 00:07:59,896
Bravo.

40
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,691
Enzo, Enzo, I saw the coin first. We split?

41
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:05,276
We can't split a coin, srupido!

42
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,077
Jacques!

43
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,418
Is it... a coin shining there?

44
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,212
It is. It's a coin.

45
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,132
I'll get it for you, Father.

46
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,760
It will be for the poor.

47
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,434
(chuckles)

48
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,857
Father!

49
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,653
Father!

50
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,117
Father!

51
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,663
(gasps)

52
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:46,753
Time to get up, Jacques.

53
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,146
(bell chimes)

54
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,237
Shit.

55
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,247
Enzo!

56
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,959
(farher) Jacques!

57
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,931
You shouldn't dive every day, Papa.

58
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,934
Then you shouldn't eat every day, Jacques.

59
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:33,985
Don't worry. When I am tired...

60
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:36,154
...the mermaids help me out.

61
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,169
Hey, have you ever seen a mermaid?

62
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,547
No.

63
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,716
I've seen them.

64
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:40,719
Don't you want to know where?

65
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:52,814
Why don't you ask me?

66
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,983
- What?
- Where I saw mermaids.

67
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:59,070
Why don't you ever ask any questions?
I always ask the questions.

68
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:02,741
Here we are, like two stones,
and now I'm talking to myself.

69
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:05,452
Ask me something, goddamn it!

70
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:08,747
Why did my mother leave?

71
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:10,874
Pump.

72
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:23,136
Your mother didn't leave.
She went back to America, that's all.

73
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,305
It's her home.

74
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:27,891
Women are like that.

75
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:30,060
Unpredictable.

76
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,354
Like the sea.

77
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,316
(snap)

78
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,485
(muffled shours)

79
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:41,571
Jacques! The water! Water!

80
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:44,240
Help! I can't breathe!

81
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,409
No!

82
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:49,454
(choking)

83
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,960
Daddy? Daddy!

84
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,712
Daddy! Daddy!

85
00:13:57,796 --> 00:13:59,547
Daddy! Daddy!

86
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:01,132
Daddy!

87
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,516
(franrically) Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

88
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:14,979
Wait! Stay here, Jacques!

89
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:16,147
Jacques!

90
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:18,483
Daddy! Daddy!

91
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,193
Jacques!

92
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:24,114
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

93
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,491
Jacques!

94
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:29,703
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

95
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:33,123
- Jacques!
- Daddy! Daddy!

96
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,542
Jacques!

97
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,003
Daddy! Daddy!

98
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:41,464
Daddy... Daddy...

99
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,990
Aiuro!

100
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:30,013
Aiuro! Aiuro!

101
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,275
(whispers)

102
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:03,672
Roberto, mio palmo.

103
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,939
Mr Molinari?

104
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:25,485
Yes! How did it happen?

105
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:30,281
Well, uh... the company asked me to
extract everything I could from the wreck.

106
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:34,327
And so the... the divers
were trying to get at the engine...

107
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:37,914
...and the boatjust turned over in the current!

108
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:42,043
Look, I... I fucked up!

109
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:43,837
Look!

110
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:46,464
Can you help?

111
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:48,633
How many are down there?

112
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:54,180
There's just one. We're feeding him lots of air
but... he's not breathing properly.

113
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:57,017
You've gotta get him outta there, fast!

114
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:02,397
Ten thousand.

115
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,985
Lire?

116
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:08,987
Dollars.

117
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:11,948
(laughs in disbelief)

118
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:14,117
Hey, wait a minute!

119
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,954
You guys aren't gonna try to
hold me up at a time like this?!

120
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:24,753
OK, you tell me.

121
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:27,589
How much would you say
a man's life is worth?

122
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:31,551
In my village we have a saying.

123
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:35,597
How does it go again?

124
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:39,768
I don't remember.

125
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:42,937
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Forget it.

126
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,545
Enzo!

127
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:10,382
Forza!

128
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:40,829
Since we have a little time,
you write that cheque?

129
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,255
How much longer can he do that?

130
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:34,466
My brother...

131
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:36,634
...is a world champion.

132
00:19:37,052 --> 00:19:38,511
Sign.

133
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:55,088
(men) Bravo!

134
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:04,973
(men) Bravo!

135
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:07,183
Bravo! Bravo!

136
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,649
Thanks! Bravo!

137
00:21:26,828 --> 00:21:28,621
Hey!

138
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:30,790
Wait! Wait a minute!

139
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:34,377
Wait a minute! Wait! Hey!

140
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:37,714
Hey, thanks, you guys.

141
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,883
Really. I mean it.

142
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:41,676
You're welcome.

143
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:56,816
(ecsraric laughrer)

144
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:04,449
Forza Iralia! Ten thousand dollars, Roberto!

145
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:07,410
Una barca di soldi!

146
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:09,579
(sounds air horn)

147
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,748
(borh laugh deliriously)

148
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:28,390
Enzo...

149
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:31,393
What are you gonna do with the money?

150
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:33,561
Have the car painted.

151
00:22:33,645 --> 00:22:36,272
But Giuseppe will do that for 25 dollars.

152
00:22:39,442 --> 00:22:42,112
Then tell him to wax it, too.

153
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:04,843
Enzo, really, what are you gonna get?

154
00:23:04,926 --> 00:23:07,429
A rosary for Mamma.

155
00:23:07,512 --> 00:23:09,597
A dress for Angelica.

156
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:13,351
Get yourself a suit that fits.

157
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:20,191
But most important...

158
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:24,404
Yes?

159
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:29,200
Find me the Frenchman.

160
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:34,581
Find me Jacques Mayol.

161
00:24:28,343 --> 00:24:33,932
El proximo paradero... es bien
el Lago del... Demonio?

162
00:24:38,353 --> 00:24:42,232
EI... el Lago del... Demonio?

163
00:24:42,315 --> 00:24:46,111
(speaks in Quechua)

164
00:24:56,246 --> 00:24:59,958
(conrinues)

165
00:25:07,966 --> 00:25:09,634
Bye.

166
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:26,401
Ooh!

167
00:25:30,864 --> 00:25:32,907
A-Are you Dr Laurence?

168
00:25:32,991 --> 00:25:35,910
No. I'm the assistant.

169
00:25:35,994 --> 00:25:38,079
Welcome to Peru.

170
00:25:39,122 --> 00:25:41,166
Thank you.

171
00:26:04,522 --> 00:26:06,399
Agh!

172
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:36,012
A drink to warm up?

173
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:38,181
Yes, please.

174
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:40,350
- Tea or whiskey?
- Both.

175
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:44,729
Did... Did I just see a man
in a red suit and goggles?

176
00:26:44,813 --> 00:26:46,898
Right.

177
00:26:49,317 --> 00:26:51,778
The insurance person is here.

178
00:26:51,861 --> 00:26:54,197
It's about time.

179
00:26:55,865 --> 00:26:58,034
Johana Baker.

180
00:26:58,118 --> 00:27:00,537
Nice trip, huh?

181
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:03,915
Thank you.

182
00:27:03,998 --> 00:27:08,003
It's three weeks since the accident.
We're getting a little anxious.

183
00:27:08,086 --> 00:27:10,588
Franck, get out there. He's ready to go in.

184
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:12,757
Right.

185
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:18,888
(Franck) First dive, two minutes.

186
00:27:38,158 --> 00:27:39,701
Who...

187
00:27:40,035 --> 00:27:42,120
Who is that?

188
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:44,873
Mayol. Jacques Mayol.

189
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:48,084
So those are your experiments?

190
00:27:48,168 --> 00:27:50,253
Dumping a guy in a frozen lake?

191
00:27:50,337 --> 00:27:52,964
The truck fell into a very deep crevasse.

192
00:27:53,048 --> 00:27:55,675
We weren't able to rescue the equipment.

193
00:27:57,135 --> 00:27:59,220
I'll have to talk to the driver.

194
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,640
In the spring, when he melts.

195
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:09,939
You really send him under the ice?

196
00:28:10,023 --> 00:28:13,068
He isn't a slave or a convict
or anything, is he?

197
00:28:13,151 --> 00:28:16,821
My dear, science is a cruel mistress.

198
00:28:26,206 --> 00:28:29,084
- How is he gonna breathe?
- He isn't.

199
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:40,553
(bleeping)

200
00:28:40,637 --> 00:28:42,722
Listen.

201
00:28:42,806 --> 00:28:44,891
That's the sound of his heart.

202
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:48,978
Can you hear the speed
at which it's slowing down?

203
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:51,773
It's incredible!

204
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:13,003
He's in the fluoroscope now.

205
00:29:13,086 --> 00:29:15,296
(slow bleeps)

206
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,465
Listen to his heartbeat!

207
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:19,634
I can't believe that!

208
00:29:19,718 --> 00:29:22,512
All the blood is concentrated in his brain.

209
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:25,432
It doesn't even feed his limbs any more.

210
00:29:25,515 --> 00:29:30,020
That's a phenomenon that's only
been observed in whales and dolphins.

211
00:29:30,103 --> 00:29:32,188
Until now.

212
00:29:33,356 --> 00:29:35,442
(slow heartbear)

213
00:29:48,413 --> 00:29:51,041
(heartbear speeds up)

214
00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:53,752
- (fasrer bleeps)
- Why is he doing this?

215
00:29:55,503 --> 00:29:57,589
I don't know.

216
00:30:41,675 --> 00:30:43,760
(gasps)

217
00:30:58,692 --> 00:31:02,028
Shouldn't someone take him
a blanket or something?

218
00:31:19,921 --> 00:31:21,381
Coffee?

219
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:36,479
- I know you.
- We just met, a few minutes ago.

220
00:31:38,606 --> 00:31:42,694
- In the lake?
- No... In the hut.

221
00:31:56,041 --> 00:31:59,794
Then it must have been someone
who looked a lot like you.

222
00:32:03,214 --> 00:32:04,257
Thanks.

223
00:32:27,906 --> 00:32:29,991
(engine srarts)

224
00:32:54,307 --> 00:32:55,600
(knocking)

225
00:33:10,156 --> 00:33:12,242
It's a present.

226
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:17,247
Thank you.

227
00:33:19,374 --> 00:33:21,459
You're not gonna open it?

228
00:33:23,461 --> 00:33:25,130
Oh.

229
00:33:38,309 --> 00:33:40,395
Are you here for a long time?

230
00:33:41,271 --> 00:33:43,023
No.

231
00:33:43,773 --> 00:33:45,650
Where do you live?

232
00:33:46,484 --> 00:33:48,153
New York.

233
00:33:58,913 --> 00:34:00,999
It's been nice meeting you.

234
00:34:05,795 --> 00:34:08,506
Nice... meeting you, too.

235
00:34:50,382 --> 00:34:53,218
I'll... I'll only be five minutes.

236
00:35:05,814 --> 00:35:07,607
(dolphin whisrles)

237
00:35:09,567 --> 00:35:11,653
(whisrling)

238
00:35:16,825 --> 00:35:18,910
(dolphin clicks)

239
00:35:21,037 --> 00:35:23,415
(whisrles)

240
00:35:24,249 --> 00:35:26,334
Clown.

241
00:35:27,961 --> 00:35:31,131
- (dolphin whisrles)
- It's a llama.

242
00:35:31,214 --> 00:35:33,299
(clicking)

243
00:35:35,844 --> 00:35:37,929
(whisrling)

244
00:35:41,975 --> 00:35:45,520
- Darjeeling.
- (clicks and whisrles)

245
00:35:50,525 --> 00:35:52,402
(excired whisrling)

246
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:02,620
I missed you rascals.

247
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:40,742
(bleeping)

248
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,814
Jacques, my friend.

249
00:37:11,856 --> 00:37:13,942
How are you?

250
00:37:14,484 --> 00:37:16,361
Enzo?

251
00:37:16,444 --> 00:37:20,031
I leave you swimming
and 20 years later you're still in the water.

252
00:37:20,115 --> 00:37:22,617
What the hell are you doing? Training?

253
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:25,578
Yeah.

254
00:37:26,663 --> 00:37:28,748
Good.

255
00:37:33,044 --> 00:37:36,172
Check out the suit. Looking good, no?

256
00:37:37,924 --> 00:37:41,094
- You know I'm the world champion?
- Yeah, I know.

257
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:46,266
The world championship
starts in ten days in Taormina.

258
00:37:47,308 --> 00:37:49,394
Be my guest.

259
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,605
Your ticket.

260
00:37:52,689 --> 00:37:54,315
Why?

261
00:37:55,775 --> 00:37:58,278
Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.

262
00:38:02,574 --> 00:38:05,326
You're the best, Enzo.

263
00:38:07,787 --> 00:38:09,581
See you there.

264
00:38:24,554 --> 00:38:27,307
(driver) Come on, let's go, let's go!

265
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:29,934
Go park in Jersey, you asshole!

266
00:38:30,018 --> 00:38:32,103
Come on, come on, come on!

267
00:38:32,187 --> 00:38:35,148
I gotta get movin'! I gotta make a livin' here!

268
00:38:38,777 --> 00:38:40,862
(sighs)

269
00:38:44,616 --> 00:38:47,577
(woman) I changed the lock,
you son of a bitch!

270
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:50,080
Sally! It's me!

271
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:53,875
Where have you been?

272
00:38:53,958 --> 00:38:55,293
Peru.

273
00:38:56,336 --> 00:38:58,421
We were burgled.

274
00:38:58,505 --> 00:39:02,133
They got the television set,
they got the new stereo...

275
00:39:02,217 --> 00:39:04,719
...they got the ring my grandma gave me.

276
00:39:04,803 --> 00:39:06,930
I hate New York.

277
00:39:09,057 --> 00:39:11,142
I hate this apartment.

278
00:39:14,521 --> 00:39:16,189
I hate you.

279
00:39:16,272 --> 00:39:18,441
How was your trip?

280
00:39:24,864 --> 00:39:26,950
It was nice. It was...

281
00:39:28,201 --> 00:39:30,286
It was...

282
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:32,580
It was interesting.

283
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,045
It was cold.

284
00:39:44,884 --> 00:39:46,970
You got a picture of him?

285
00:39:54,185 --> 00:39:56,062
Matter of fact...

286
00:40:04,362 --> 00:40:06,448
What... What the fuck is that?

287
00:40:09,701 --> 00:40:11,995
It's his heartbeat.

288
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:16,499
I'm gonna make some coffee.

289
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:18,668
They left the stove!

290
00:40:31,431 --> 00:40:34,100
He has the most beautiful eyes.

291
00:40:35,185 --> 00:40:36,853
It's funny.

292
00:40:39,856 --> 00:40:41,900
It's like a fairy tale.

293
00:40:41,983 --> 00:40:43,651
(coughs)

294
00:40:43,735 --> 00:40:46,696
You know, the French
are very romantic people.

295
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:50,867
He's not French. He's American.
His mother's American.

296
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:53,620
Haven't you been listening
to anything I said?

297
00:40:53,703 --> 00:40:56,164
Yeah! I've been listening all night!

298
00:40:56,247 --> 00:40:58,333
Sounds like you're in love.

299
00:40:58,416 --> 00:41:01,711
But there's no such thing
as love at first sight.

300
00:41:03,129 --> 00:41:05,215
You ate all the ice cream.

301
00:41:19,896 --> 00:41:22,399
(sighs)

302
00:41:26,444 --> 00:41:29,155
This is good! This is very good!

303
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:30,907
Very, very good.

304
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:32,575
Very good.

305
00:41:32,659 --> 00:41:34,703
Unfortunately it's incomplete.

306
00:41:35,704 --> 00:41:37,789
- Johana...
- What?

307
00:41:37,872 --> 00:41:39,958
- Am I boring you?
- No!

308
00:41:40,041 --> 00:41:42,043
Of course not.

309
00:41:42,127 --> 00:41:43,962
Definitely not.

310
00:41:44,045 --> 00:41:48,633
- What'd you say?
- I said that this file is incomplete. OK?

311
00:41:48,717 --> 00:41:51,469
Go back to Laurence
and get the truck registration.

312
00:41:51,553 --> 00:41:54,389
Don't let him tell you
it's in the glove compartment.

313
00:41:55,306 --> 00:41:58,184
- The guy was really frozen?
- Like a Popsicle.

314
00:41:58,268 --> 00:42:01,521
- They're keeping him on a stick till spring.
- Hah!

315
00:42:01,604 --> 00:42:03,690
Glad I didn't go.

316
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:10,655
I... I can't hear you!

317
00:42:10,739 --> 00:42:14,159
I said the snowmobile papers
are in the glove compartment.

318
00:42:14,242 --> 00:42:16,786
Get the customs office to send me a copy.

319
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:20,498
We can't get you new equipment
until our file is complete.

320
00:42:20,582 --> 00:42:23,543
All right. You'll have them
by the end of the week.

321
00:42:23,626 --> 00:42:27,797
Great. You've made me a very happy
insurance person. Thank you.

322
00:42:27,881 --> 00:42:30,133
- All right. Goodbye.
- Dr Laurence?

323
00:42:30,216 --> 00:42:31,634
Yes?

324
00:42:31,718 --> 00:42:36,097
Um... You don't happen to know how I can
get in touch with that diver of yours?

325
00:42:36,181 --> 00:42:37,974
Jacques Mayol?

326
00:42:39,392 --> 00:42:43,980
The last I heard he was in Taormina,
at the World Diving Championships.

327
00:42:44,064 --> 00:42:45,940
In Sicily.

328
00:42:46,024 --> 00:42:48,109
Sicily?

329
00:42:49,652 --> 00:42:52,906
Duffy, we got big problems in Sicily!

330
00:42:52,989 --> 00:42:55,283
- What do you mean?
- Oh, God-the Mafia!

331
00:42:55,367 --> 00:42:57,660
Cosa Nostra, De Niro, Coppola, Pacino!

332
00:42:57,744 --> 00:43:00,330
I knew we shouldn't have written that policy!

333
00:43:00,413 --> 00:43:02,999
- What happened?
- The documents are forged.

334
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:05,168
- No!
- Yes! The notary is a phoney.

335
00:43:05,251 --> 00:43:08,129
He's got the same signature as the contractor.

336
00:43:08,213 --> 00:43:10,674
- Wait, that can't be true!
- Well, it is!

337
00:43:10,757 --> 00:43:15,553
We must send someone immediately. If we
prove the forgery, maybe we're off the hook.

338
00:43:15,637 --> 00:43:19,724
There's a plane in four hours to Rome.
From there, it's not far to Sicily.

339
00:43:19,808 --> 00:43:23,687
- I'm calling Cordoza. He'll get us out of this.
- No! I called him.

340
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:26,940
- His son's bar mitzvah is tomorrow.
- Oh, damn his son!

341
00:43:27,023 --> 00:43:29,484
- I'll go.
- You'd do that?!

342
00:43:29,567 --> 00:43:31,695
- Yeah, I'll go.
- Oh, thank you!

343
00:43:31,778 --> 00:43:34,197
I thought it was Spanish you spoke.

344
00:43:36,116 --> 00:43:38,910
Italian's... practically the same thing.

345
00:43:57,303 --> 00:43:59,389
Thanks a lot!

346
00:43:59,472 --> 00:44:01,558
(announcemenr in Iralian)

347
00:44:18,783 --> 00:44:20,952
Mayol... Mayol... No reservation.

348
00:44:27,417 --> 00:44:30,086
- Are you sure?
- Positive, sir.

349
00:44:31,338 --> 00:44:33,423
This is the Hotel San-Domenico?

350
00:44:33,506 --> 00:44:36,843
Yes, it has been so for 127 years.

351
00:44:38,386 --> 00:44:40,430
(air horn)

352
00:44:40,513 --> 00:44:42,766
(tyres screech)

353
00:44:47,103 --> 00:44:49,981
Be careful of that car.
It's a new paintjob. OK?

354
00:44:50,065 --> 00:44:51,566
Conressa!

355
00:44:51,649 --> 00:44:53,026
Avanri, avanri!

356
00:44:53,693 --> 00:44:55,904
Ah! Jacques!

357
00:44:57,072 --> 00:44:58,865
Giacomino, my friend!

358
00:44:58,948 --> 00:45:01,034
My brother!

359
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:04,662
So, you finally decided to join us.

360
00:45:04,746 --> 00:45:07,207
You did the right thing.

361
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:08,958
Paolo, come srai? C'è la chiave.

362
00:45:09,042 --> 00:45:11,670
You remember my little brother Roberto?

363
00:45:11,753 --> 00:45:14,923
- Hi.
- Hi, Roberto.

364
00:45:15,006 --> 00:45:18,093
- What room have you got?
- I haven't got one.

365
00:45:18,176 --> 00:45:20,637
You don't have a room? Paolo!

366
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:25,016
What did I just hear? I call you to reserve
a room for my friend Jacques Mayol...

367
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,185
...and you treat him like a stranger!

368
00:45:27,268 --> 00:45:31,856
- It's OK, Enzo. I'll go somewhere else.
- Not only is he a very special friend.

369
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:35,777
But he is one of the best divers in the world.
And you sling him out!

370
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:38,154
Are you crazy or what?

371
00:45:38,238 --> 00:45:39,906
Srupido!

372
00:45:39,989 --> 00:45:42,534
Drop it, Enzo. I'll find something.

373
00:45:44,661 --> 00:45:46,496
(keys jingle)

374
00:45:46,579 --> 00:45:49,624
Take mine. I'll take the Countess's suite.

375
00:45:49,708 --> 00:45:52,502
She told me she was leaving
for the cemetery.

376
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:55,922
She'll be more comfortable there! Ha!

377
00:46:01,177 --> 00:46:03,263
I'm glad you're here.

378
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:18,028
So, after all these years, you must have
lots of questions to ask me. Am I right?

379
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:20,196
Yeah, sure, lots of questions.

380
00:46:25,618 --> 00:46:27,704
Well, what are they?

381
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:35,378
I don't know how to ask the questions.

382
00:46:39,174 --> 00:46:42,218
- Are you married?
- (laughs) No, no, no, no, no!

383
00:46:44,429 --> 00:46:45,972
No.

384
00:46:46,931 --> 00:46:49,017
Me neither. Because of my mother.

385
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:51,186
She's a curse, my mother. Tornado.

386
00:46:51,269 --> 00:46:54,397
Srubborn as a mule. Ti ricorda, no?

387
00:46:54,481 --> 00:46:59,861
I was engaged for a week. After, Mamma was
so mad, the pasta was bouncing off the walls!

388
00:47:02,781 --> 00:47:04,866
So, not married.

389
00:47:04,949 --> 00:47:07,035
Good for you.

390
00:47:07,118 --> 00:47:10,872
You play the field, like me.
A girl in every port, huh?

391
00:47:10,955 --> 00:47:13,249
- After all, we're men!
- Damn right!

392
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:17,087
That's what I tell them
when people say you've turned into a fish.

393
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:18,755
People say that?

394
00:47:21,758 --> 00:47:23,843
Forget it! I was joking!

395
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:50,662
Ah! La Madonna!

396
00:47:54,666 --> 00:47:56,751
(sniggers)

397
00:47:56,835 --> 00:48:00,005
I'll bet you my watch
that she's in my bed tonight.

398
00:48:02,507 --> 00:48:04,592
Hello!

399
00:48:04,676 --> 00:48:06,761
(squeals wirh mock surprise)

400
00:48:06,845 --> 00:48:08,930
- You know each other?
- Yes!

401
00:48:09,014 --> 00:48:13,643
- Enzo Molinari. This is a great pleasure.
- Johana Baker. Nice to meet you.

402
00:48:13,727 --> 00:48:16,646
This is... a coincidence! It's unbelievable!

403
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:20,442
All the way out here!
It's incredible! I can't believe it!

404
00:48:22,944 --> 00:48:24,154
Oh.

405
00:48:24,988 --> 00:48:27,073
Uh... Would you like to sit down?

406
00:48:27,157 --> 00:48:29,242
Yes. Thank you.

407
00:48:32,162 --> 00:48:35,874
- I'm not interrupting anything, am I?
- No, not at all.

408
00:48:35,957 --> 00:48:37,625
Emilio! Vieni qui!

409
00:48:37,709 --> 00:48:41,880
- You staying at the hotel?
- It's full. But they recommended a pensione.

410
00:48:41,963 --> 00:48:46,051
- All of Taormina is full.
- It's the Free Diving World Championship.

411
00:48:46,134 --> 00:48:48,094
I am, by the way, world champion.

412
00:48:48,178 --> 00:48:52,891
- What are you doing in Sicily?
- I was doing an insurance claim in Palermo...

413
00:48:52,974 --> 00:48:56,186
...and decided to take a few days off,
see the island.

414
00:48:56,269 --> 00:49:00,023
There is no place in the world
more beautiful than Sicily.

415
00:49:00,106 --> 00:49:03,651
Spaghetti del mare
for the super-dedicated insurance agent.

416
00:49:03,735 --> 00:49:06,112
Oh, no, no, no. Thank you. Just a coffee.

417
00:49:06,196 --> 00:49:08,782
No, you should try it. It's good.

418
00:49:08,865 --> 00:49:10,241
OK.

419
00:49:10,325 --> 00:49:13,578
As I was saying earlier,
I am the world champion free diver.

420
00:49:13,787 --> 00:49:17,040
Some people say it's
the most virile sport in the world.

421
00:49:17,123 --> 00:49:19,542
One has to admit that seeing those men...

422
00:49:19,626 --> 00:49:24,422
...diving headfirst in that deep blue sea,
all muscles contracted...

423
00:49:24,506 --> 00:49:26,508
- Enzo...
- What?!

424
00:49:26,591 --> 00:49:28,927
- Mamma?
- Dove?

425
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:31,096
Aspetta.

426
00:49:33,306 --> 00:49:37,268
She'll kill me if she catches me
eating pasta in a restaurant.

427
00:49:37,352 --> 00:49:39,521
Mangia, mangia. Mangia! Bullshit.

428
00:49:39,604 --> 00:49:41,606
Eat!

429
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:44,234
Mamma!

430
00:49:48,697 --> 00:49:52,117
Tu credi che io possa portare
da sola rutti quesri bagagli?

431
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:55,954
Mamma... Roberto and an elevator.
Isn't that enough?

432
00:49:57,038 --> 00:49:59,666
- Che cosa hai mangiaro ru oggi?
- Coffee only.

433
00:49:59,749 --> 00:50:02,002
I am diving tomorrow. Ah!

434
00:50:02,085 --> 00:50:04,796
Remember little Jacques? Jacques Mayol?

435
00:50:04,879 --> 00:50:06,756
His friend - Johana.

436
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,925
She is beautiful, no?

437
00:50:12,762 --> 00:50:15,015
Spaghetti del mare!

438
00:50:22,313 --> 00:50:24,399
Oh, thank you very much! Mm!

439
00:50:27,402 --> 00:50:29,487
I'm so hungry!

440
00:50:30,655 --> 00:50:32,282
Ha!

441
00:50:32,365 --> 00:50:34,451
Mm, it's good.

442
00:50:37,162 --> 00:50:38,830
Americana?

443
00:50:40,123 --> 00:50:42,083
Benvenura!

444
00:51:01,019 --> 00:51:03,313
This is it.

445
00:51:03,396 --> 00:51:05,982
It's... great!

446
00:51:10,236 --> 00:51:13,198
So, you're gonna be
really busy these days, huh?

447
00:51:13,281 --> 00:51:15,367
I don't know.

448
00:51:16,242 --> 00:51:17,869
Why?

449
00:51:17,952 --> 00:51:20,038
I... Because I...

450
00:51:21,122 --> 00:51:23,208
I don't know. I just thought...

451
00:51:24,876 --> 00:51:27,420
You have the competition, interviews.

452
00:51:27,504 --> 00:51:32,550
A competition like this requires
a great deal of concentration... Doesn't it?

453
00:51:36,262 --> 00:51:38,556
Yeah.

454
00:51:40,308 --> 00:51:42,394
You can put down the bags now.

455
00:51:48,358 --> 00:51:50,610
Thanks.

456
00:51:50,694 --> 00:51:52,779
- (air horn)
- Jacques! Johana!

457
00:51:52,862 --> 00:51:57,283
We have to get ready for the ceremony.
The Tahitian is the new world champion.

458
00:51:57,367 --> 00:51:59,452
I'm tired. I don't feel like it.

459
00:52:00,537 --> 00:52:02,706
Roberto, the jacket.

460
00:52:03,998 --> 00:52:06,084
- This one?
- Yes.

461
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:13,925
Very good.

462
00:52:18,054 --> 00:52:20,181
What about the shoes?

463
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,227
Very chic.

464
00:52:24,310 --> 00:52:27,397
- Well, you don't have anything else, do you?
- No.

465
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:30,358
Then it's very chic. Avanri.

466
00:52:39,284 --> 00:52:40,910
Hi.

467
00:52:41,953 --> 00:52:43,580
Hi.

468
00:52:43,663 --> 00:52:46,082
- (mike feedback)
- Ladies and gentlemen...

469
00:52:46,166 --> 00:52:48,251
...your attention, please.

470
00:52:48,335 --> 00:52:52,922
André Bonnet, president of the International
Diving Championship Committee...

471
00:52:54,299 --> 00:52:55,967
(whispers) E basra di mangiare!

472
00:52:56,051 --> 00:52:58,345
...this trophy to the new world champion.

473
00:52:58,428 --> 00:53:03,475
This afternoon, our new champion
descended to the remarkable depth...

474
00:53:03,558 --> 00:53:06,102
...of 310 feet.

475
00:53:09,356 --> 00:53:11,441
A one-day hero.

476
00:53:11,524 --> 00:53:14,444
(presenrer) Mr President, if you please...

477
00:53:18,073 --> 00:53:20,241
A new world record. That's great.

478
00:53:20,325 --> 00:53:22,869
It gives me something to beat tomorrow.

479
00:53:22,952 --> 00:53:25,205
- Have you ever been to Tahiti?
- No.

480
00:53:25,288 --> 00:53:27,999
I'll take you there. We'll live in the sun.

481
00:53:28,083 --> 00:53:30,001
You'll cook fresh fish...

482
00:53:30,085 --> 00:53:32,837
...and we'll make love under the coconut trees.

483
00:53:32,921 --> 00:53:35,340
Hey, wait. How about you do the cooking?

484
00:53:35,423 --> 00:53:37,509
And... uh... you forgot the hula.

485
00:53:37,592 --> 00:53:40,303
Excuse me.

486
00:53:47,811 --> 00:53:50,105
He looks strange, doesn't he?

487
00:53:50,188 --> 00:53:52,565
Like a baby who just learned to walk.

488
00:53:53,942 --> 00:53:56,236
- Have you known him long?
- For ever.

489
00:53:56,319 --> 00:54:00,615
We used to live on the same island in Greece,
when we were kids.

490
00:54:03,243 --> 00:54:06,162
- What was he like when he was little?
- Little.

491
00:54:06,246 --> 00:54:08,289
Very little.

492
00:54:08,373 --> 00:54:10,458
That is, compared to me.

493
00:54:10,542 --> 00:54:13,962
- I get it, Enzo. You were a superior child.
- Exactly.

494
00:54:15,005 --> 00:54:17,173
What is it, Johana?

495
00:54:17,257 --> 00:54:20,760
You are so crazy about him,
you don't see the truth?

496
00:54:20,844 --> 00:54:25,056
Don't think of Jacques as a human being.
He is from another world.

497
00:54:27,183 --> 00:54:29,686
And just what world are you from, Enzo?

498
00:54:30,854 --> 00:54:32,397
Iralia!

499
00:54:34,816 --> 00:54:36,484
OK.

500
00:54:41,114 --> 00:54:42,657
(whispers) Iralia.

501
00:54:42,741 --> 00:54:44,826
And now, my friends...

502
00:54:44,909 --> 00:54:48,455
...you are all invited for a drink
around the swim pool.

503
00:55:19,069 --> 00:55:22,864
Today, at lunch, you asked me
if I had any questions.

504
00:55:22,947 --> 00:55:26,951
Ah! You finally want to know about women!

505
00:55:29,037 --> 00:55:32,207
- Are they what's most important?
- No.

506
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:34,376
It depends.

507
00:55:35,377 --> 00:55:37,462
Sometime they are.

508
00:55:39,089 --> 00:55:41,216
What exactly do you want to know?

509
00:55:42,258 --> 00:55:44,427
Everything.

510
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:47,806
Everything about what?

511
00:55:50,141 --> 00:55:52,227
About everything.

512
00:55:56,606 --> 00:55:58,692
Mamma mia!

513
00:55:58,775 --> 00:56:00,860
(plays piano)

514
00:56:11,037 --> 00:56:13,665
So, between Mamma, Roberto and Alfredo...

515
00:56:13,748 --> 00:56:15,834
...we yell and scream all day long.

516
00:56:15,917 --> 00:56:18,420
Except with Angelica. She just cries.

517
00:56:19,462 --> 00:56:23,133
And then, finally, we all end up kissing.

518
00:56:23,216 --> 00:56:25,301
Can you explain that to me?

519
00:56:25,385 --> 00:56:27,804
(hirs keys) Huh?

520
00:56:29,264 --> 00:56:31,766
Because that's what love is all about.

521
00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:33,935
It's a pain in the ass...

522
00:56:34,019 --> 00:56:36,104
...but it keeps us together.

523
00:56:38,648 --> 00:56:40,734
A large...

524
00:56:41,901 --> 00:56:43,987
...and beautiful...

525
00:56:45,947 --> 00:56:48,033
(hirs high nore)

526
00:56:48,116 --> 00:56:50,326
...family.

527
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:52,912
(Enzo plays wistful rune)

528
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,044
Enzo...

529
00:56:59,127 --> 00:57:00,712
Yeah?

530
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:04,215
We've gotta quit this competition.

531
00:57:04,299 --> 00:57:06,384
Why?

532
00:57:06,468 --> 00:57:08,970
Cos... if we don't...

533
00:57:09,054 --> 00:57:11,639
...l'm gonna beat you.

534
00:57:15,685 --> 00:57:18,021
(Enzo plays upbear rune)

535
00:57:18,104 --> 00:57:20,857
(laughs) Do you hear that?

536
00:57:22,984 --> 00:57:25,070
(crunches ice)

537
00:57:26,279 --> 00:57:28,365
- What?
- He looks me in the eye...

538
00:57:28,448 --> 00:57:30,533
...like some fucking goldfish...

539
00:57:30,617 --> 00:57:34,079
...and says..."I'm gonna beat you."

540
00:57:34,162 --> 00:57:36,831
(Jacques and Johana giggle drunkenly)

541
00:57:46,132 --> 00:57:48,426
That's what you guys are here for.

542
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:50,595
Ha! Listen to her!

543
00:57:50,679 --> 00:57:53,014
That's what he's here for! (laughs)

544
00:57:54,182 --> 00:57:57,519
He's here to lose! That's what he's here for.

545
00:57:57,602 --> 00:58:00,105
First of all, I am unbeatable.

546
00:58:01,773 --> 00:58:03,441
Second...

547
00:58:03,525 --> 00:58:06,778
- How old are you?
- Two years younger than you.

548
00:58:06,861 --> 00:58:08,947
As I said...

549
00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:11,408
...second of all, you're too skinny.

550
00:58:11,491 --> 00:58:16,913
You've got tiny lungs. I still don't understand
how you can dive without getting sick.

551
00:58:16,996 --> 00:58:20,083
The size of the lungs
has nothing to do with it.

552
00:58:20,166 --> 00:58:22,919
The size of the lungs
has nothing to do with it.

553
00:58:23,003 --> 00:58:25,880
How long can you hold your breath?

554
00:58:27,674 --> 00:58:29,759
Longer than you.

555
00:58:29,843 --> 00:58:32,470
Ah... We'll see.

556
00:59:58,598 --> 01:00:01,726
- Come srai, Enzo!
- Figlio mio! Sono la madre!

557
01:00:07,232 --> 01:00:09,859
Hey! Take it easy! Jesus!

558
01:00:12,904 --> 01:00:14,989
What, are you nuts?

559
01:00:18,535 --> 01:00:20,620
(door slams)

560
01:00:27,210 --> 01:00:29,379
Come on, let me help you with this.

561
01:00:29,462 --> 01:00:31,715
- Who won?
- What? The Asshole Award?

562
01:00:31,798 --> 01:00:33,842
Let me tell you, it was a tie.

563
01:00:33,925 --> 01:00:36,469
Acting like a pair of two-year-olds.

564
01:00:36,553 --> 01:00:39,097
You could've died in that pool.

565
01:00:43,727 --> 01:00:45,812
(groans)

566
01:00:46,730 --> 01:00:49,232
Stop moving. You're rocking the boat.

567
01:00:49,315 --> 01:00:51,401
Luckily, I was there to save you.

568
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:57,532
My wallet.

569
01:01:00,243 --> 01:01:03,079
- It's here.
- No, no. I wanna show you.

570
01:01:03,163 --> 01:01:05,248
Give it to me.

571
01:01:08,209 --> 01:01:09,919
Sit down.

572
01:01:29,105 --> 01:01:31,191
That's my family.

573
01:01:45,872 --> 01:01:47,957
What kind of man...

574
01:01:48,625 --> 01:01:50,710
...has such a family?

575
01:02:00,679 --> 01:02:02,764
(Jacques sobs)

576
01:02:06,976 --> 01:02:09,062
It's OK.

577
01:02:14,275 --> 01:02:16,361
It's all right.

578
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:23,785
(Jacques wails)

579
01:02:58,695 --> 01:03:00,780
(sighs)

580
01:03:06,119 --> 01:03:08,204
- Enzo!
- Si!

581
01:03:08,288 --> 01:03:10,373
Avanri, avanri.

582
01:03:13,752 --> 01:03:16,463
All the medics are looking for you, Enzo.

583
01:03:16,546 --> 01:03:18,631
I am meditating! Can't you see?

584
01:03:18,715 --> 01:03:21,885
Jacques does two hours of yoga
before going down!

585
01:03:21,968 --> 01:03:24,054
I can have a five-minute nap!

586
01:03:39,110 --> 01:03:41,404
Mr Molinari, I am sorry...

587
01:03:41,488 --> 01:03:44,824
...but you cannot dive
in this state of exhaustion.

588
01:03:49,704 --> 01:03:52,165
What do you know about the sea? Nothing!

589
01:03:52,248 --> 01:03:55,251
So you just take your tubes
and your tin cans away.

590
01:03:56,002 --> 01:03:58,088
The sea is mine.

591
01:03:58,171 --> 01:04:01,299
I know when she is ready for me
and when she isn't.

592
01:04:01,383 --> 01:04:03,468
And today she is ready.

593
01:04:03,551 --> 01:04:05,428
Capisci?

594
01:04:05,512 --> 01:04:07,180
You dive at your own risk.

595
01:04:08,139 --> 01:04:10,934
Ah! Bravo.

596
01:04:26,866 --> 01:04:28,952
(conrrolled panring)

597
01:04:39,087 --> 01:04:41,297
One minute!

598
01:04:56,271 --> 01:04:57,731
Three!

599
01:04:58,231 --> 01:04:59,691
Two!

600
01:05:00,191 --> 01:05:01,651
One!

601
01:05:52,118 --> 01:05:54,204
Your pants are too big for me.

602
01:06:00,627 --> 01:06:02,712
Where are they?

603
01:06:02,796 --> 01:06:04,881
(giggles)

604
01:06:09,427 --> 01:06:11,513
Thank you.

605
01:06:11,596 --> 01:06:14,933
- Where is everybody?
- They're gone.

606
01:06:15,016 --> 01:06:17,102
(Jacques) Something's wrong.

607
01:06:30,407 --> 01:06:32,492
You can't do that.

608
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:34,661
What's the matter?

609
01:06:34,744 --> 01:06:36,788
I don't understand.

610
01:06:36,871 --> 01:06:39,290
I've tried for two days. They won't eat.

611
01:06:39,374 --> 01:06:41,418
They won't perform.

612
01:06:41,501 --> 01:06:43,586
Since we got a new one.

613
01:06:45,422 --> 01:06:47,298
(dolphin whisrles)

614
01:06:48,216 --> 01:06:51,011
It's finished for today.

615
01:06:51,094 --> 01:06:53,179
She's a new one.

616
01:06:54,639 --> 01:06:56,725
How can you tell it's a female?

617
01:06:56,808 --> 01:06:58,685
(dolphin clicks)

618
01:06:58,768 --> 01:07:00,854
It's the way she moves.

619
01:07:00,937 --> 01:07:03,023
(whisrles)

620
01:07:11,406 --> 01:07:13,158
Hey!

621
01:07:14,284 --> 01:07:16,369
Jacques!

622
01:07:28,131 --> 01:07:29,799
(screams)

623
01:07:29,883 --> 01:07:31,551
Help!

624
01:07:31,634 --> 01:07:33,845
Porca miseria.

625
01:07:35,305 --> 01:07:37,390
Jacques, help me!

626
01:07:39,267 --> 01:07:41,936
(Johana giggles)

627
01:07:53,865 --> 01:07:55,950
Really...

628
01:08:10,674 --> 01:08:12,759
(whisrling and clicking)

629
01:08:24,604 --> 01:08:27,565
(crowd) Enzo! Enzo! Enzo!

630
01:08:28,650 --> 01:08:31,528
(cheering and shouring)

631
01:08:34,698 --> 01:08:39,536
- (Jacques) Enzo!
- Ah... Jacques! Johana!

632
01:08:39,619 --> 01:08:42,956
Don't be sad. I only took back what was mine.

633
01:08:43,039 --> 01:08:45,125
Here. A present.

634
01:08:45,208 --> 01:08:50,296
Tonight we're having a little party
among ourselves. Eight o'clock in my suite.

635
01:08:50,505 --> 01:08:52,465
(knocks)

636
01:08:52,549 --> 01:08:55,885
Mr Roberto, tell your brother
to be reasonable.

637
01:08:55,969 --> 01:08:58,638
Everybody's waiting for him upstairs.

638
01:08:58,722 --> 01:09:01,224
(Roberto) He can't! He's indisposed!

639
01:09:01,307 --> 01:09:03,393
Shall we call a doctor?

640
01:09:03,476 --> 01:09:06,187
No, no! La Mamma, she is trying something!

641
01:09:06,271 --> 01:09:08,356
(door shurs)

642
01:09:09,441 --> 01:09:14,946
Oh, Mr Mayol, help us. He refuses to receive
his medal, and everybody's waiting for him.

643
01:09:18,742 --> 01:09:21,453
- I'll do my best.
- That's very kind of you.

644
01:09:22,662 --> 01:09:24,247
It's Jacques!

645
01:09:24,330 --> 01:09:25,957
Jacques!

646
01:09:26,041 --> 01:09:28,126
My friend! Come on in!

647
01:09:28,209 --> 01:09:31,046
Mr Molinari, allow me to impress upon you...

648
01:09:31,129 --> 01:09:34,758
...the importance of your attending
the award ceremony...

649
01:09:34,841 --> 01:09:36,968
...for the press.

650
01:09:37,052 --> 01:09:41,348
I think my brother told you I was indisposed.
That should do it, no?

651
01:09:41,431 --> 01:09:44,601
I am allowed to be indisposed, right?

652
01:09:44,684 --> 01:09:48,563
So you just go tell the press
that the big Enzo Molinari...

653
01:09:48,646 --> 01:09:53,526
...overwhelmed by his inspiring descent
of 324 feet...

654
01:09:53,610 --> 01:09:56,404
...will not be able to receive his trinket...

655
01:09:56,488 --> 01:09:58,114
...because he is...

656
01:09:58,198 --> 01:10:00,408
- Hm?
...he is...

657
01:10:00,492 --> 01:10:02,327
Indisposed!

658
01:10:02,410 --> 01:10:03,995
Bravi!

659
01:10:06,998 --> 01:10:09,084
Jacques, my friend!

660
01:10:09,167 --> 01:10:14,172
- Why don't you go pick up your medal?
- Ah, because pasta should be eaten al denre!

661
01:10:32,148 --> 01:10:34,234
Let me know how you find it.

662
01:10:41,116 --> 01:10:42,951
(Johana) Duffy!

663
01:10:43,034 --> 01:10:45,120
Yes, I'm here. I can hardly hear you.

664
01:10:45,203 --> 01:10:47,288
Almost everything is... yeah.

665
01:10:47,372 --> 01:10:49,290
Two... maybe three days.

666
01:10:50,959 --> 01:10:52,585
But, um...

667
01:10:52,669 --> 01:10:54,754
No, I'm in a restaurant. What?

668
01:10:54,838 --> 01:10:57,007
OK, I'll call you back. I promise.

669
01:10:57,090 --> 01:10:58,717
Tomorrow.

670
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,677
OK. OK.

671
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:02,220
Yes!

672
01:11:04,139 --> 01:11:07,600
My office in New York.
It's really busy back there.

673
01:11:07,684 --> 01:11:09,769
I have so much work to do.

674
01:11:11,146 --> 01:11:13,231
Is it good?

675
01:11:13,314 --> 01:11:16,067
- Do you want some?
- Oh, no.

676
01:11:17,777 --> 01:11:19,863
Buon apperiro, signorina.

677
01:11:21,781 --> 01:11:23,867
Thank you.

678
01:11:35,086 --> 01:11:37,172
Ah... Jacques!

679
01:11:38,590 --> 01:11:40,675
What's the matter?

680
01:11:41,926 --> 01:11:44,012
I have to ask you a favour.

681
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:56,149
Hey, we're not stealing a dolphin, eh?

682
01:11:56,232 --> 01:11:58,943
No. I told you, we're just helping one out.

683
01:12:01,237 --> 01:12:03,907
- Trying to help one out?
- Yes!

684
01:12:05,492 --> 01:12:07,786
Good.

685
01:12:12,749 --> 01:12:14,417
- Buona sera.
- Buona sera.

686
01:12:14,501 --> 01:12:16,086
(dolphin whisrles)

687
01:12:21,424 --> 01:12:22,926
(Johana gasps)

688
01:12:23,009 --> 01:12:25,970
(Enzo) Taormina by night!
Lucky dolphin, eh?

689
01:12:26,054 --> 01:12:28,056
(dolphin whisrles)

690
01:12:29,432 --> 01:12:31,518
Yeah! Stairs!

691
01:12:34,479 --> 01:12:37,065
(dolphin clicks)

692
01:12:40,068 --> 01:12:42,153
(Enzo whisrles)

693
01:12:50,286 --> 01:12:52,163
(dolphin whisrles)

694
01:13:00,964 --> 01:13:03,049
(dolphin whisrles and clicks)

695
01:13:18,231 --> 01:13:21,901
You can stop that now.
She has all the water she needs.

696
01:13:26,948 --> 01:13:30,493
(Enzo) All right, we did it!
Let's go back to the party.

697
01:13:32,454 --> 01:13:35,623
(dolphin whisrles)

698
01:13:39,252 --> 01:13:41,338
Jacques!

699
01:13:41,421 --> 01:13:43,506
(dolphin whisrles and clicks)

700
01:13:50,930 --> 01:13:53,016
Five minutes, that's all! OK?

701
01:14:07,822 --> 01:14:10,700
Well, then... Good night.

702
01:14:10,784 --> 01:14:12,869
Night.

703
01:14:12,952 --> 01:14:15,288
- Good night, Jacques.
- Good night.

704
01:14:21,795 --> 01:14:24,714
You don't need a stretcher
to take her with you.

705
01:14:24,798 --> 01:14:27,467
- You know that?
- What?

706
01:14:28,551 --> 01:14:32,847
Dolphins aren't the only ones
who don't feel very good sometimes.

707
01:14:34,766 --> 01:14:36,851
Jacques! Can I...

708
01:14:36,935 --> 01:14:39,020
...come watch you dive tomorrow?

709
01:14:44,693 --> 01:14:45,944
Yeah.

710
01:14:48,071 --> 01:14:49,531
Good.

711
01:14:53,743 --> 01:14:57,080
You really do have
a few things to learn about women.

712
01:15:14,347 --> 01:15:16,683
(brearhes deeply and holds brearh)

713
01:15:30,405 --> 01:15:32,782
(Johana) What do those guys do?

714
01:15:32,866 --> 01:15:34,951
They are paramedics.

715
01:15:35,035 --> 01:15:37,162
They wait at 200 feet.

716
01:15:55,847 --> 01:15:57,724
And him?

717
01:15:57,807 --> 01:16:00,810
That is the diver who goes below 300 feet.

718
01:16:00,894 --> 01:16:05,648
He dives with a helium-oxygen mixture.
Compressed air is too dangerous.

719
01:17:14,259 --> 01:17:15,927
Three minutes!

720
01:23:51,114 --> 01:23:53,199
- It's fantastic!
- Ha vinro?

721
01:23:53,283 --> 01:23:55,869
360 feet! Yes!

722
01:23:56,828 --> 01:23:58,913
Enzo!

723
01:23:58,997 --> 01:24:03,335
(Enzo) Congratulations, Jacques.
It's wonderful. I'm happy for you.

724
01:24:03,418 --> 01:24:05,086
Here.

725
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:07,005
Here.

726
01:24:07,088 --> 01:24:10,050
- What is it?
- Little presents. Nothing much.

727
01:24:11,259 --> 01:24:14,054
I knew it. I just knew it.

728
01:24:19,267 --> 01:24:21,895
- Do you still collect them?
- Mm-hm.

729
01:24:21,978 --> 01:24:24,064
You don't have that one, do you?

730
01:24:25,607 --> 01:24:27,484
No.

731
01:24:27,567 --> 01:24:29,944
It's beautiful. Thank you.

732
01:24:30,028 --> 01:24:32,113
It's nothing.

733
01:24:32,197 --> 01:24:34,282
I knew it. I told Roberto.

734
01:24:34,366 --> 01:24:37,911
He's very good, that little Frenchman.
Very good.

735
01:24:37,994 --> 01:24:41,790
- Is this a poem?
- No, it's a recipe for spaghetti frutti del mare.

736
01:24:41,873 --> 01:24:44,584
Ha! Thank you.

737
01:24:46,336 --> 01:24:51,257
You see? I was right in getting you out here.
You're a world champion, my friend.

738
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:06,189
It's a measuring tape.

739
01:25:07,857 --> 01:25:10,151
You see? This is your record.

740
01:25:10,235 --> 01:25:12,612
Three feet more than mine.

741
01:25:14,072 --> 01:25:17,867
Looking at it from here,
it doesn't look like much, does it?

742
01:25:21,454 --> 01:25:24,708
Keep your little measuring tape, my friend.

743
01:25:24,791 --> 01:25:27,752
It will be a nice souvenir
when I beat you next.

744
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:29,165
(dolphin whisrles)

745
01:27:45,724 --> 01:27:47,809
(dolphin whisrles)

746
01:28:04,659 --> 01:28:06,244
Jacques?

747
01:30:35,226 --> 01:30:36,686
God!

748
01:30:43,401 --> 01:30:45,278
Did you have a nice night?

749
01:30:46,154 --> 01:30:47,739
Yeah.

750
01:30:51,493 --> 01:30:53,578
I was with the dolphin.

751
01:30:54,954 --> 01:30:56,414
All night?

752
01:30:57,540 --> 01:30:59,000
Yeah.

753
01:31:00,043 --> 01:31:03,046
- With the dolphin?
- Yeah.

754
01:31:09,636 --> 01:31:12,764
I gotta get back to New York.

755
01:31:17,519 --> 01:31:22,107
Because I have my job,
I have my work and my... life.

756
01:31:37,455 --> 01:31:39,833
Will you take me to the train station?

757
01:31:39,916 --> 01:31:42,002
(clicking)

758
01:32:03,106 --> 01:32:06,234
(rhunder)

759
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:09,446
(rrain conducror's whisrle)

760
01:32:15,410 --> 01:32:18,830
(announcemenr in Iralian)

761
01:32:24,169 --> 01:32:25,837
Jacques!

762
01:32:26,338 --> 01:32:29,215
If you're ever in New York,
give me a call, OK?

763
01:32:30,592 --> 01:32:32,469
Jacques!

764
01:32:50,236 --> 01:32:53,573
- Can I come in?
- No problem. I enjoy talking in my sleep.

765
01:33:01,873 --> 01:33:04,751
Wake me up at 11.

766
01:33:18,848 --> 01:33:20,934
(Enzo murmurs)

767
01:33:30,110 --> 01:33:35,240
Why are you always talkin'? Nobody's
interested in what you're talkin' about.

768
01:33:35,365 --> 01:33:39,536
So just stop talkin'! Other people
have things to say! Understand?

769
01:33:39,619 --> 01:33:42,080
Stop talkin'! It's bullshit!

770
01:33:42,163 --> 01:33:45,083
- She's gone?
- Yes, she's gone!

771
01:33:47,460 --> 01:33:49,546
Hey, I'm gonna take care of you.

772
01:33:49,629 --> 01:33:51,715
I've got ajob, on an oil rig.

773
01:33:51,965 --> 01:33:53,508
No sweat.

774
01:33:53,591 --> 01:33:55,677
I'm taking you along. OK?

775
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:59,723
Come on, get your bags packed.
You're coming with me.

776
01:34:01,016 --> 01:34:03,101
You stupid bastard.

777
01:34:05,395 --> 01:34:07,480
(laughs)

778
01:34:07,564 --> 01:34:10,442
We'll make a great team, the two of us.

779
01:34:10,525 --> 01:34:12,610
You'll see.

780
01:34:12,694 --> 01:34:14,779
OK?

781
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:20,994
(sighs)

782
01:35:06,998 --> 01:35:09,084
(alarm)

783
01:35:27,894 --> 01:35:29,979
(clinking)

784
01:35:35,735 --> 01:35:38,029
100 feer.

785
01:35:39,781 --> 01:35:41,825
(Enzo blows his nose)

786
01:35:44,202 --> 01:35:46,287
You're still thinking about her.

787
01:35:46,371 --> 01:35:49,708
Don't think about her any more.

788
01:35:49,791 --> 01:35:52,377
There are so many women in the world.

789
01:35:52,460 --> 01:35:55,964
Plenty of women everywhere. Right?

790
01:35:56,047 --> 01:35:58,133
Smoking is absolutely forbidden.

791
01:35:58,216 --> 01:36:00,218
It isn't lit yet.

792
01:36:00,885 --> 01:36:03,805
You shouldn't even carry cigarettes on board.

793
01:36:05,473 --> 01:36:08,351
Listen, we're not supposed to piss, either.

794
01:36:08,435 --> 01:36:11,688
But that doesn't stop you
from carrying ir on board.

795
01:36:12,188 --> 01:36:14,274
The rules are the rules.

796
01:36:15,567 --> 01:36:17,444
What's your name again?

797
01:36:18,278 --> 01:36:19,904
Noireuter.

798
01:36:19,988 --> 01:36:22,073
And where did you say you were from?

799
01:36:24,534 --> 01:36:25,994
Brussels.

800
01:36:26,077 --> 01:36:28,163
Hah!

801
01:36:28,246 --> 01:36:31,082
Bella città, bella città.

802
01:36:31,166 --> 01:36:33,251
200.

803
01:36:45,847 --> 01:36:48,183
I was 17.

804
01:36:48,266 --> 01:36:51,686
I loved her so much, I tried to die for her.

805
01:36:51,770 --> 01:36:53,855
Two years later...

806
01:36:53,938 --> 01:36:56,274
...I couldn't even remember her name.

807
01:36:56,358 --> 01:36:58,443
Let me tell you...

808
01:36:58,526 --> 01:37:01,988
...time erases everything.

809
01:37:02,072 --> 01:37:04,157
I don't want to erase anything.

810
01:37:14,376 --> 01:37:17,170
450 feer. End of descenr.

811
01:37:19,589 --> 01:37:22,634
(high-pirched)
We'll be left here for 50 minutes.

812
01:37:22,717 --> 01:37:25,220
(high-pirched) What's with the voice?

813
01:37:25,303 --> 01:37:28,264
It's nothing. Maybe the helium is up too high.

814
01:37:28,348 --> 01:37:30,141
(blasr of gas)

815
01:37:30,225 --> 01:37:34,020
- (high-pirched) Does the voice come back?
- For others, yes.

816
01:37:34,104 --> 01:37:36,731
For you... Who knows?

817
01:37:39,693 --> 01:37:41,986
(high-pirched) Try speaking to me.

818
01:37:42,779 --> 01:37:47,742
(high-pirched) I don't find this funny.
We were having a serious conversation!

819
01:37:49,202 --> 01:37:51,287
(Enzo laughs) Mamma mia!

820
01:37:51,371 --> 01:37:53,456
(Noireurer) Ir's OK for rhe helium.

821
01:37:54,916 --> 01:37:57,335
Here, give me your finger.

822
01:37:57,836 --> 01:37:59,921
Uh... Is that alcohol?

823
01:38:00,922 --> 01:38:02,841
That's really forbidden!

824
01:38:02,924 --> 01:38:05,427
Hey, do you have any other complaints?

825
01:38:05,510 --> 01:38:08,680
Make a list and we'll stick it
on the porthole. OK?

826
01:38:08,763 --> 01:38:13,393
- Suck your finger.
- Stop kidding around. It's...

827
01:38:13,476 --> 01:38:16,896
It's dangerous at this pressure-alcohol.

828
01:38:16,980 --> 01:38:19,482
Enzo, it's very deep down here.

829
01:38:19,566 --> 01:38:21,651
Come on, suck your finger.

830
01:38:28,783 --> 01:38:31,578
Ah, you'll be seeing mermaids everywhere.

831
01:38:31,661 --> 01:38:33,747
(laughs giddily)

832
01:38:38,376 --> 01:38:43,089
A thousand commanders and we get
the Belgian from Alcoholics Anonymous!

833
01:38:56,936 --> 01:38:59,022
(Enzo and Jacques laughing)

834
01:38:59,522 --> 01:39:01,483
Are we clear?

835
01:39:01,691 --> 01:39:04,444
(Enzo laughing and mumbling incoherenrly)

836
01:39:10,241 --> 01:39:12,786
(Jacques ralks gibberish and giggles)

837
01:39:22,712 --> 01:39:26,383
- (drunken laughrer)
- Can you hear me?

838
01:39:28,009 --> 01:39:30,095
(drunkenly humming a waltz)

839
01:39:56,371 --> 01:39:58,456
(rusrling)

840
01:40:04,587 --> 01:40:07,007
I didn't get the fucking commercial.

841
01:40:20,895 --> 01:40:23,565
So, did you see a therapist?

842
01:40:25,233 --> 01:40:27,318
Yeah.

843
01:40:27,402 --> 01:40:29,487
What did he say?

844
01:40:29,571 --> 01:40:32,490
He said I have a decision to make.

845
01:40:32,574 --> 01:40:34,659
The answer is within me.

846
01:40:37,954 --> 01:40:40,040
And you paid for that?

847
01:40:40,123 --> 01:40:42,208
Yeah.

848
01:40:45,754 --> 01:40:47,839
What did you decide?

849
01:40:48,757 --> 01:40:51,009
Nothing.

850
01:40:51,092 --> 01:40:55,472
(sighs) Jesus, Jo,
you're driving me crazy with this already!

851
01:40:57,724 --> 01:41:00,769
You don't wanna go shopping
or talk about my career...

852
01:41:00,852 --> 01:41:03,021
...or do anything you used to wanna do!

853
01:41:03,104 --> 01:41:07,150
All you wanna do is talk about this guy
that you don't even know!

854
01:41:07,233 --> 01:41:09,611
Just make the fucking decision!

855
01:41:10,362 --> 01:41:12,030
OK.

856
01:41:14,657 --> 01:41:16,743
Heads-stay, tails-go.

857
01:41:16,826 --> 01:41:18,495
OK?

858
01:41:29,130 --> 01:41:30,674
Stay.

859
01:41:30,757 --> 01:41:32,759
Good.

860
01:41:32,967 --> 01:41:34,928
Bad. Very bad.

861
01:41:35,011 --> 01:41:38,556
We weren't being cheated
by the Mafia anyway-except you.

862
01:41:38,640 --> 01:41:41,518
Duffy, I know you think I'm a terrible person.

863
01:41:41,601 --> 01:41:43,687
I'm not a terrible person.

864
01:41:46,856 --> 01:41:48,942
I fell in love.

865
01:41:49,693 --> 01:41:51,778
I mean, I really fell in love.

866
01:41:51,861 --> 01:41:53,947
Do you understand?

867
01:41:54,030 --> 01:41:57,450
I understand...
I could have you arrested for fraud.

868
01:41:57,534 --> 01:42:01,705
I'd be happy to pay you back,
but I just don't have the money right now.

869
01:42:01,788 --> 01:42:05,792
- If you dock my salary, say, $20 a week...
- Don't be cute, Johana.

870
01:42:05,875 --> 01:42:09,671
- I guess this is where you fire me.
- You're right! You're fired.

871
01:42:09,754 --> 01:42:11,339
Thanks.

872
01:42:12,924 --> 01:42:16,011
All right, who is this guy? This lucky guy.

873
01:42:18,346 --> 01:42:21,599
Remember Laurence in Peru?
It's one of his divers.

874
01:42:21,683 --> 01:42:25,353
- The Popsicle stick?
- Yeah. No, it's a different guy.

875
01:42:28,314 --> 01:42:31,443
Well, I'm happy for you.

876
01:42:33,945 --> 01:42:36,031
Good luck.

877
01:42:45,540 --> 01:42:47,625
(phone rings)

878
01:42:51,546 --> 01:42:52,589
Hello.

879
01:42:53,548 --> 01:42:55,216
Jacques?

880
01:42:55,592 --> 01:42:57,677
It's Johana.

881
01:42:58,678 --> 01:43:00,347
How are you?

882
01:43:02,098 --> 01:43:03,767
Good.

883
01:43:04,267 --> 01:43:05,935
I got fired.

884
01:43:06,019 --> 01:43:08,104
I got this job with Enzo.

885
01:43:08,188 --> 01:43:10,315
We got fired, too.

886
01:43:10,398 --> 01:43:12,484
(laughs) Really?

887
01:43:15,904 --> 01:43:17,989
It's strange.

888
01:43:24,371 --> 01:43:26,456
Talk to me some more.

889
01:43:26,539 --> 01:43:30,710
It's hard. I don't know what else to say.
You're so far away.

890
01:43:32,629 --> 01:43:34,714
Tell me a story.

891
01:43:36,591 --> 01:43:38,677
A story?

892
01:43:42,931 --> 01:43:45,016
Do you know how it is...

893
01:43:45,934 --> 01:43:49,521
Do you know what you're supposed to do
to meet a mermaid?

894
01:43:49,604 --> 01:43:51,690
No.

895
01:43:53,191 --> 01:43:55,610
You go down to the bottom of the sea...

896
01:43:56,361 --> 01:43:59,322
...where the water isn't even blue any more...

897
01:43:59,406 --> 01:44:01,491
...and the sky is only a memory...

898
01:44:01,574 --> 01:44:04,494
...and you float there, in the silence...

899
01:44:05,537 --> 01:44:07,622
...and you stay there...

900
01:44:09,082 --> 01:44:12,043
...and you decide... that you'll die for them.

901
01:44:12,127 --> 01:44:14,587
Only then do they start comin' out.

902
01:44:14,671 --> 01:44:19,259
They come, and they greet you,
and they judge the love you have for them.

903
01:44:20,301 --> 01:44:22,387
If it's sincere...

904
01:44:23,847 --> 01:44:25,932
...if it's pure...

905
01:44:27,559 --> 01:44:29,644
...they'll be with you...

906
01:44:30,603 --> 01:44:32,689
...and take you away for ever.

907
01:44:40,530 --> 01:44:43,366
I like that story.

908
01:46:40,442 --> 01:46:42,027
What is it?

909
01:46:44,154 --> 01:46:46,239
I think I love you.

910
01:47:21,232 --> 01:47:23,318
You live here?

911
01:47:23,401 --> 01:47:25,904
Yeah. Sometimes.

912
01:47:41,461 --> 01:47:44,089
- Who's that?
- That's my Uncle Louis.

913
01:47:51,554 --> 01:47:53,723
I can't get him out of the bathtub.

914
01:47:53,807 --> 01:47:55,892
Sorry.

915
01:48:03,733 --> 01:48:05,944
(Louis gasps for brearh)

916
01:48:10,407 --> 01:48:11,991
Assassin!

917
01:48:13,868 --> 01:48:16,371
Uncle Louis! This is my friend Johana!

918
01:48:16,454 --> 01:48:18,164
Hi!

919
01:48:19,749 --> 01:48:21,835
Johana is visiting me!

920
01:48:21,918 --> 01:48:24,004
He's a bit deaf. He's 75.

921
01:48:24,087 --> 01:48:27,132
It's very nice to meet you, Uncle Louis!

922
01:48:29,217 --> 01:48:31,261
(moans)

923
01:48:31,344 --> 01:48:33,972
(Louis rakes deep brearh and submerges)

924
01:48:40,979 --> 01:48:43,398
(§ "Ride Of The Valkyries" by Wagner)

925
01:48:46,776 --> 01:48:48,737
(music conrinues playing)

926
01:48:48,820 --> 01:48:52,032
So, where are you from, Henrietta?

927
01:48:52,115 --> 01:48:54,492
Johana! New York!

928
01:48:56,453 --> 01:48:59,247
New York? What kind of name is that?

929
01:48:59,330 --> 01:49:02,876
- No, l-I'm from New York.
- Oh, yeah!

930
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:06,838
(Louis) The best legs are from New York!

931
01:49:10,967 --> 01:49:13,053
Uncle Louis...

932
01:49:14,888 --> 01:49:16,973
Johana is my friend.

933
01:49:22,562 --> 01:49:25,273
She's come to... stay with me...

934
01:49:27,233 --> 01:49:29,319
...for a while.

935
01:49:29,402 --> 01:49:32,614
Good. That way I'll see more of you.

936
01:49:32,697 --> 01:49:34,783
Where are you gonna stay?

937
01:49:35,658 --> 01:49:39,913
- Here.
- Here? In my apartment?

938
01:49:40,705 --> 01:49:42,791
It's my apartment.

939
01:49:42,874 --> 01:49:46,044
Liar! Cheat! Torturer!

940
01:49:46,127 --> 01:49:49,297
Uncle Louis, go back to your bathtub.

941
01:49:49,381 --> 01:49:52,550
I'm going to put a lock on the telephone.

942
01:49:55,887 --> 01:49:58,473
Have some more wine, Uncle Louis.

943
01:50:00,934 --> 01:50:03,478
Thank you, Henrietta.

944
01:50:04,062 --> 01:50:06,147
(whispers) I'll change my name.

945
01:50:23,248 --> 01:50:25,333
This is, uh...

946
01:50:25,417 --> 01:50:27,293
...my room.

947
01:50:44,102 --> 01:50:48,815
Enzo phoned. He's coming over next week
for another competition.

948
01:50:48,898 --> 01:50:50,650
Great.

949
01:50:50,734 --> 01:50:52,944
Are you gonna compete, too?

950
01:50:54,946 --> 01:50:56,406
Yeah.

951
01:51:04,122 --> 01:51:06,416
Are you sure you'll be all right here?

952
01:51:59,761 --> 01:52:01,846
It's not like him to be late.

953
01:52:01,930 --> 01:52:04,933
Of course, sometimes
he doesn't show up at all.

954
01:52:05,892 --> 01:52:07,977
Two dollars?!

955
01:52:08,478 --> 01:52:12,440
You didn't even need to catch the fish!

956
01:52:12,524 --> 01:52:15,276
It died of cancer!

957
01:52:15,777 --> 01:52:18,071
(air horn)

958
01:52:18,154 --> 01:52:19,948
Hello!

959
01:52:20,031 --> 01:52:22,367
Enzo!

960
01:52:22,450 --> 01:52:24,452
Jacques!

961
01:52:24,536 --> 01:52:26,621
Johana!

962
01:52:28,498 --> 01:52:30,625
Where did you get that?

963
01:52:30,709 --> 01:52:33,670
That? This is not a "that".

964
01:52:33,753 --> 01:52:37,382
This is Bonita Mariposa,
the famous Spanish actress...

965
01:52:37,465 --> 01:52:40,760
...who is going to be very careful
with the varnish...

966
01:52:40,844 --> 01:52:44,639
- Hello, darling!
...and who is spending a few days with us.

967
01:52:44,723 --> 01:52:46,808
- Hi.
- I'm Bonita.

968
01:52:49,686 --> 01:52:53,523
- Where is Mamma?
- You have eight hours before she gets here.

969
01:52:54,983 --> 01:52:57,235
Va bene.

970
01:52:57,318 --> 01:53:02,490
- (§ "Ride Of The Valkyries"plays loudly)
- He's really going totally deaf.

971
01:53:02,574 --> 01:53:05,118
I'm not as deaf as you are blind!

972
01:53:06,286 --> 01:53:10,081
You take care of your eyes,
and I'll take care of my ears!

973
01:53:10,540 --> 01:53:12,917
I'm sorry, Uncle Louis. (laughs)

974
01:53:14,627 --> 01:53:16,713
Come on, drink up, my boy!

975
01:53:16,796 --> 01:53:18,882
Grazie.

976
01:53:23,845 --> 01:53:25,930
(knocking)

977
01:53:26,014 --> 01:53:30,143
Hey, tell me, what century are you in?

978
01:53:30,226 --> 01:53:32,687
Second.

979
01:53:32,771 --> 01:53:34,230
(knocking)

980
01:53:35,065 --> 01:53:36,858
I'm glad you're here.

981
01:53:37,901 --> 01:53:39,527
Thank you.

982
01:53:40,236 --> 01:53:42,322
What's going on here?

983
01:53:42,405 --> 01:53:45,075
We're listening to some music. With Enzo.

984
01:53:45,158 --> 01:53:46,993
Come on in.

985
01:53:48,161 --> 01:53:51,331
- This is Dr Laurence.
- Ah!

986
01:53:52,374 --> 01:53:55,710
So, you must be the famous Enzo Molinari.

987
01:53:55,794 --> 01:53:58,838
In the flesh! I have that honour.

988
01:54:04,469 --> 01:54:07,430
(Johana) God... I'm getting wrinkles.

989
01:54:07,889 --> 01:54:10,892
Mm-hm. And I'm getting pimples.

990
01:54:13,103 --> 01:54:15,730
So, are you gonna live here permanently?

991
01:54:15,814 --> 01:54:18,608
I don't know. Things have happened so fast.

992
01:54:18,692 --> 01:54:20,777
We haven't even talked about it.

993
01:54:22,487 --> 01:54:24,823
You're very much in love. I can tell.

994
01:54:26,950 --> 01:54:29,035
Yeah, I am.

995
01:54:29,119 --> 01:54:31,246
You have that look.

996
01:54:32,288 --> 01:54:34,666
The look of a woman who wants a baby.

997
01:54:34,749 --> 01:54:36,376
Baby?!

998
01:54:36,459 --> 01:54:38,545
Oh, no... I...

999
01:54:38,628 --> 01:54:41,172
I haven't even thought of having a baby.

1000
01:54:41,256 --> 01:54:45,635
God, we're just... starting
to get to know each other. It'd be really...

1001
01:54:45,719 --> 01:54:47,762
Do I really?

1002
01:54:47,846 --> 01:54:50,473
Well, maybe he's not quite ready, but...

1003
01:54:51,266 --> 01:54:53,351
...he's a nice guy, sensitive.

1004
01:54:56,563 --> 01:54:59,733
Well, I can't have a baby by myself.

1005
01:54:59,816 --> 01:55:02,360
Why not? I have a baby.

1006
01:55:02,444 --> 01:55:04,529
I loved his father.

1007
01:55:04,612 --> 01:55:06,865
We're not together any more but...

1008
01:55:06,948 --> 01:55:09,034
...I have his baby.

1009
01:55:11,369 --> 01:55:14,372
At the end, you do it alone anyway.

1010
01:55:25,008 --> 01:55:27,093
Enzo!

1011
01:55:28,470 --> 01:55:31,264
Cu! Cucù!

1012
01:55:31,348 --> 01:55:33,433
Via, via.

1013
01:55:33,850 --> 01:55:36,186
Enzo Molinari for classification.

1014
01:55:41,566 --> 01:55:43,276
Enzo!

1015
01:55:45,945 --> 01:55:47,989
Ciao.

1016
01:55:48,073 --> 01:55:50,158
What was his last time?

1017
01:55:51,910 --> 01:55:54,829
I don't know, but it was really long.

1018
01:56:14,599 --> 01:56:16,685
(clunk)

1019
01:57:03,982 --> 01:57:05,817
Hey, that's not bad.

1020
01:57:05,900 --> 01:57:08,153
Bravo, Enzo. Magnifico. Bravissimo.

1021
01:57:09,487 --> 01:57:10,488
Enzo!

1022
01:57:10,572 --> 01:57:12,657
Vai, vai.

1023
01:57:12,741 --> 01:57:14,826
Very good, Enzo. Very good.

1024
01:57:23,084 --> 01:57:24,336
Aaargh!

1025
01:57:27,922 --> 01:57:30,383
So what? Anybody can have a bad day.

1026
01:57:30,467 --> 01:57:34,012
Well, I've had many,
when the sea doesn't want you.

1027
01:57:34,095 --> 01:57:38,350
It's never the sea.
It's Mamma, Roberto, that stupid actress!

1028
01:57:40,352 --> 01:57:42,437
Don't break my balls.

1029
01:58:02,916 --> 01:58:05,543
Anyway, I have something to tell you.

1030
01:58:06,378 --> 01:58:09,506
- I'm pregnant.
- (Sally) Argh! You're kidding!

1031
01:58:09,589 --> 01:58:11,466
I knew you were gonna do that!

1032
01:58:11,549 --> 01:58:13,843
Because... No, I'm kidding.

1033
01:58:13,927 --> 01:58:16,721
No. No, I wish I was.

1034
01:58:21,184 --> 01:58:24,270
I'll call you back tomorrow, OK? I promise.

1035
01:58:24,354 --> 01:58:26,564
(Johana hangs up) Hi.

1036
01:58:38,868 --> 01:58:40,995
Did you have a nice day?

1037
01:58:42,080 --> 01:58:44,332
Enzo had a bad day.

1038
01:58:47,085 --> 01:58:48,753
Did you dive?

1039
01:58:53,633 --> 01:58:55,719
No, it didn't feel right.

1040
01:59:03,268 --> 01:59:05,353
It's a cute baby, huh?

1041
01:59:05,437 --> 01:59:07,397
I love that baby.

1042
01:59:23,663 --> 01:59:25,540
(rakes deep brearh)

1043
02:00:33,441 --> 02:00:36,444

1044
02:00:42,450 --> 02:00:44,494
(low whisrle)

1045
02:00:44,577 --> 02:00:47,080
Il campione del mondo!

1046
02:00:52,877 --> 02:00:54,129
Bravo, Enzo, bravo.

1047
02:00:54,671 --> 02:00:57,257
Let them try.

1048
02:00:58,466 --> 02:01:01,052
(men) Bravo!

1049
02:01:26,911 --> 02:01:29,497
(alarm)

1050
02:02:14,459 --> 02:02:16,544
(alarm)

1051
02:02:30,600 --> 02:02:33,144
(alarm)

1052
02:02:35,397 --> 02:02:37,273
Is he OK?

1053
02:02:42,070 --> 02:02:44,030
(man shours order in Japanese)

1054
02:02:52,038 --> 02:02:54,499
OK. Yes.

1055
02:02:54,582 --> 02:02:56,668
(shours in Japanese)

1056
02:02:57,877 --> 02:02:59,963
Enzo!

1057
02:03:02,590 --> 02:03:04,676
(rakes deep brearh)

1058
02:03:04,759 --> 02:03:06,845
(men shour encouragemenr)

1059
02:03:10,557 --> 02:03:12,642
What are they doing?

1060
02:03:13,268 --> 02:03:15,353
I don't know.

1061
02:03:21,026 --> 02:03:22,902
(clears rhroar)

1062
02:03:30,827 --> 02:03:32,704
D'accord.

1063
02:03:42,839 --> 02:03:44,716
No!

1064
02:03:45,842 --> 02:03:47,927
(shouring in Japanese)

1065
02:03:53,475 --> 02:03:55,560
(shouring)

1066
02:03:57,103 --> 02:03:59,189
Great time!

1067
02:03:59,272 --> 02:04:01,358
Benissimo!

1068
02:04:09,324 --> 02:04:10,992
- Merci.
- Monsieur.

1069
02:04:14,204 --> 02:04:16,289
How was it?

1070
02:04:17,665 --> 02:04:19,751
It was dangerous.

1071
02:04:19,834 --> 02:04:21,920
380 feet...

1072
02:04:22,003 --> 02:04:24,798
...four minutes and 50 seconds underwater.

1073
02:04:24,881 --> 02:04:27,258
Great.

1074
02:04:30,762 --> 02:04:32,597
Enzo!

1075
02:04:32,681 --> 02:04:34,974
Giacomino!

1076
02:04:35,058 --> 02:04:37,143
Congratulations!

1077
02:04:37,352 --> 02:04:39,145
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1078
02:04:39,229 --> 02:04:41,648
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1079
02:04:42,399 --> 02:04:43,942
Bravo, Enzo!

1080
02:04:44,025 --> 02:04:46,861
Mio figlio, bravo!

1081
02:04:47,779 --> 02:04:49,864
(clapping conrinues)

1082
02:04:50,782 --> 02:04:52,450
Now...

1083
02:04:52,867 --> 02:04:54,494
Now...

1084
02:04:54,577 --> 02:05:00,041
I am sure you heard some people suggest
it is too dangerous for us to continue.

1085
02:05:00,125 --> 02:05:02,961
Dangerous because
we don't know how to measure...

1086
02:05:03,044 --> 02:05:06,756
...the physiological consequences
of this type of dive.

1087
02:05:06,840 --> 02:05:11,511
And also because the scuba divers
are not used to going down below 300 feet.

1088
02:05:13,179 --> 02:05:15,265
- But...
- Cosa dice?

1089
02:05:15,348 --> 02:05:17,934
...we asked the free divers...

1090
02:05:18,018 --> 02:05:20,186
...and they all insist...

1091
02:05:20,270 --> 02:05:23,023
...that the competition continue.

1092
02:05:23,106 --> 02:05:25,191
(clapping)

1093
02:05:28,778 --> 02:05:30,864
Bravo.

1094
02:05:30,947 --> 02:05:34,117
Good luck to you all. Good luck.

1095
02:06:42,143 --> 02:06:44,229
(brearhes deeply)

1096
02:06:48,775 --> 02:06:50,860
One minute!

1097
02:07:14,300 --> 02:07:15,760
Three!

1098
02:07:16,052 --> 02:07:17,512
Two!

1099
02:07:17,804 --> 02:07:19,264
One!

1100
02:08:41,012 --> 02:08:43,098
You can't stay here!

1101
02:09:10,709 --> 02:09:12,335
Do you see him?

1102
02:09:15,422 --> 02:09:17,340
Hey! Do you see him?!

1103
02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:35,525
Jacques!

1104
02:10:05,805 --> 02:10:07,891
(clapping and cheering)

1105
02:10:14,189 --> 02:10:16,274
Bravo, Jacques! Bravo!

1106
02:10:20,779 --> 02:10:22,864
- (bleep)
- Thank you.

1107
02:10:29,037 --> 02:10:30,872
400 feet.

1108
02:10:30,955 --> 02:10:34,376
- 400 feet!
- (cheering)

1109
02:10:34,459 --> 02:10:36,544
Hoo-hoo!

1110
02:10:47,472 --> 02:10:49,015
Bravo, Jacques!

1111
02:10:50,475 --> 02:10:52,352
You all right?

1112
02:11:01,403 --> 02:11:03,488
(Johana) I'll be right there!

1113
02:11:03,822 --> 02:11:05,907
Hi! Come on in.

1114
02:11:06,574 --> 02:11:08,660
No. I wanted to say goodbye.

1115
02:11:08,743 --> 02:11:11,037
- You're leaving?
- Yeah.

1116
02:11:11,121 --> 02:11:13,373
Could you please give this to Enzo?

1117
02:11:15,250 --> 02:11:16,918
OK.

1118
02:11:18,795 --> 02:11:20,880
It's no use.

1119
02:11:21,881 --> 02:11:26,136
Just tell him I said goodbye,
and give him a kiss for me. OK?

1120
02:11:27,178 --> 02:11:29,681
- Promise?
- Promise.

1121
02:11:32,058 --> 02:11:34,561
Maybe you shouldn't give up so easily.

1122
02:11:35,937 --> 02:11:38,023
Here's a present for you.

1123
02:11:42,402 --> 02:11:44,612
It's your baby.

1124
02:11:45,947 --> 02:11:47,615
Yeah.

1125
02:11:49,075 --> 02:11:51,703
Believe me, it will change your life...

1126
02:11:51,786 --> 02:11:53,788
...only for the better.

1127
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,252
You take care of yourself, Johana.

1128
02:12:00,170 --> 02:12:02,255
You, too.

1129
02:12:02,339 --> 02:12:03,965
Bye-bye.

1130
02:12:04,049 --> 02:12:05,717
Bye.

1131
02:12:06,926 --> 02:12:08,595
Bye.

1132
02:12:56,184 --> 02:12:58,269
(whisrles)

1133
02:13:09,739 --> 02:13:12,992
(whisrling and clicking)

1134
02:13:16,579 --> 02:13:19,791
(whisrles)

1135
02:13:22,252 --> 02:13:24,129
Thank you.

1136
02:13:25,171 --> 02:13:26,840
Thank you.

1137
02:13:31,594 --> 02:13:33,680
(whisrling conrinues)

1138
02:14:13,178 --> 02:14:15,805
Welcome to Greece, Jacques! How are you?

1139
02:14:15,889 --> 02:14:18,141
Welcome, Johana. Have a good trip?

1140
02:14:18,224 --> 02:14:21,644
OK, let me give you all the information.
Come with me.

1141
02:14:38,036 --> 02:14:40,121
Oh...

1142
02:14:40,205 --> 02:14:42,290
This is making me sick.

1143
02:14:44,167 --> 02:14:46,252
(sighs) Why?

1144
02:14:47,879 --> 02:14:50,048
Would you give me a glass of water?

1145
02:14:54,678 --> 02:14:56,763
(door opens)

1146
02:15:11,736 --> 02:15:13,822
Nervous about the competition?

1147
02:15:14,364 --> 02:15:15,949
No.

1148
02:15:21,955 --> 02:15:24,124
What's it feel like when you dive?

1149
02:15:30,463 --> 02:15:33,341
It's a feeling of slipping without falling.

1150
02:15:35,427 --> 02:15:38,013
The hardest thing is when you hit the bottom.

1151
02:15:41,016 --> 02:15:42,475
Why?

1152
02:15:46,062 --> 02:15:49,315
Because you have to find
a good reason to come back up.

1153
02:15:50,358 --> 02:15:52,527
And I have a hard time finding one.

1154
02:16:00,326 --> 02:16:02,412
Well, we have the same problem.

1155
02:16:05,290 --> 02:16:06,332
Why?

1156
02:16:06,416 --> 02:16:10,211
Because I have a hard time
finding a good reason to stay.

1157
02:16:33,234 --> 02:16:35,320
I found one.

1158
02:16:41,951 --> 02:16:44,996
Ciao, Enzo! Ciao.

1159
02:16:49,626 --> 02:16:51,378
Enzo.

1160
02:16:51,461 --> 02:16:53,338
Is he here?

1161
02:16:55,048 --> 02:16:56,508
Yeah.

1162
02:16:59,135 --> 02:17:00,804
Good.

1163
02:17:44,139 --> 02:17:46,975
It scares me when you look
at the sea like that.

1164
02:17:53,648 --> 02:17:56,109
I used to dive here when I was a boy.

1165
02:17:59,529 --> 02:18:02,323
I have something I want to talk to you about.

1166
02:18:02,407 --> 02:18:04,492
Not here.

1167
02:18:14,210 --> 02:18:15,670
OK.

1168
02:18:27,390 --> 02:18:29,476
Can we talk here?

1169
02:18:49,788 --> 02:18:51,873
Let's talk about my world.

1170
02:18:54,417 --> 02:18:56,294
My world is you.

1171
02:19:02,300 --> 02:19:04,386
I love you.

1172
02:19:07,180 --> 02:19:09,265
I wanna live with you.

1173
02:19:10,809 --> 02:19:12,894
I wanna have a baby with you.

1174
02:19:14,646 --> 02:19:16,731
I wanna have a house with you.

1175
02:19:16,815 --> 02:19:19,943
A car with you. A dog with you.

1176
02:19:20,026 --> 02:19:22,028
You know?

1177
02:19:22,112 --> 02:19:25,365
Jacques, I think I might be pregnant!

1178
02:19:30,495 --> 02:19:32,580
Did you hear me?

1179
02:19:34,040 --> 02:19:36,126
Jacques?

1180
02:19:39,671 --> 02:19:41,756
Jacques?

1181
02:19:43,842 --> 02:19:45,927
Jacques!

1182
02:19:48,888 --> 02:19:52,559
JAAAAAACQUES!

1183
02:20:01,943 --> 02:20:04,029
God...!

1184
02:20:10,952 --> 02:20:13,038
(Enzo playing piano)

1185
02:20:22,005 --> 02:20:24,090
Tomorrow is going to be a big day.

1186
02:21:52,512 --> 02:21:57,100
When I analysed the data from
Mayol's last dive, it became apparent.

1187
02:21:57,183 --> 02:22:01,396
At the depths these men are diving,
it is a physiological impossibility...

1188
02:22:01,479 --> 02:22:05,233
...that they could retain enough oxygen
to make it to the surface.

1189
02:22:05,316 --> 02:22:10,697
The pressure is so strong, it stops the oxygen
from circulating through the body.

1190
02:22:10,780 --> 02:22:13,825
To attempt to break Mayol's record now...

1191
02:22:13,908 --> 02:22:15,994
...is simple suicide.

1192
02:22:18,288 --> 02:22:20,206
Do you understand?

1193
02:22:21,583 --> 02:22:23,668
Yes, I understand.

1194
02:22:24,919 --> 02:22:27,005
Today is just training.

1195
02:22:29,215 --> 02:22:32,469
- Molinari is a 17-time world champion.
- Three minutes!

1196
02:22:32,552 --> 02:22:34,637
Do you want to tell him he can't dive?

1197
02:22:36,473 --> 02:22:38,224
Ah.

1198
02:22:40,518 --> 02:22:42,729
Cancel the competition.

1199
02:22:49,736 --> 02:22:51,821
Two minutes!

1200
02:22:57,285 --> 02:22:59,162
Get Mayol in here.

1201
02:23:03,041 --> 02:23:04,918
(short, sharp brearhs)

1202
02:23:05,001 --> 02:23:07,087
One minute!

1203
02:23:08,213 --> 02:23:10,298
(slower, deeper brearhs)

1204
02:23:22,519 --> 02:23:25,021
They wanna cancel the competition.

1205
02:23:25,105 --> 02:23:27,190
For a while.

1206
02:23:28,358 --> 02:23:30,235
Why?

1207
02:23:31,611 --> 02:23:33,697
It's not safe, they say.

1208
02:23:38,076 --> 02:23:40,161
The doctors say...

1209
02:23:41,496 --> 02:23:44,082
...we can't go deeper and survive.

1210
02:23:45,959 --> 02:23:48,503
You say that because you have the title.

1211
02:23:48,586 --> 02:23:50,130
No.

1212
02:23:50,213 --> 02:23:52,298
I would never cheat you.

1213
02:23:55,593 --> 02:23:57,679
That's very nice of you.

1214
02:24:05,395 --> 02:24:08,440
Oh, Jesus! I told you to tell him not to go!

1215
02:24:08,523 --> 02:24:10,692
It's not my fault! I told him!

1216
02:24:15,572 --> 02:24:17,657
- No, no, no!
- And then they die!

1217
02:24:17,741 --> 02:24:21,327
No! Ma che volere? E la prima
volra che organizzo un rorneo!

1218
02:25:28,436 --> 02:25:31,189
(alarm)

1219
02:25:31,272 --> 02:25:33,108
No... No...

1220
02:25:33,191 --> 02:25:34,818
Wonderful!

1221
02:25:42,325 --> 02:25:43,910
(alarm srops)

1222
02:25:46,371 --> 02:25:47,997
Get away!

1223
02:25:48,081 --> 02:25:49,833
(Jacques) Will you get away?!

1224
02:25:49,916 --> 02:25:51,459
Goddamn it!

1225
02:25:51,543 --> 02:25:53,837
Get away!

1226
02:25:53,920 --> 02:25:57,048
- Give him some time! Leave him alone!
- Out!

1227
02:25:59,968 --> 02:26:01,636
(Laurence) Clear off!

1228
02:26:20,822 --> 02:26:23,324
You were right.

1229
02:26:25,827 --> 02:26:27,454
About what?

1230
02:26:28,913 --> 02:26:30,999
It's much better down there.

1231
02:26:35,003 --> 02:26:37,088
It's a better place.

1232
02:26:54,022 --> 02:26:56,358
Push me back in the water.

1233
02:26:57,525 --> 02:26:59,611
No, I can't.

1234
02:27:02,572 --> 02:27:04,657
Jacques...

1235
02:27:06,701 --> 02:27:08,912
Take me back down.

1236
02:27:16,586 --> 02:27:18,421
Please.

1237
02:27:37,732 --> 02:27:39,818
(wails) No!

1238
02:28:12,684 --> 02:28:14,269
Oh, look!

1239
02:28:59,439 --> 02:29:01,399
Up with the arms... Over the top...

1240
02:29:01,483 --> 02:29:03,068
Come on, Jacques.

1241
02:29:06,321 --> 02:29:08,406
Let's get a heartbeat.

1242
02:29:08,490 --> 02:29:10,367
Come on, Jacques!

1243
02:29:10,450 --> 02:29:13,244
Come on, Jacques. Come on, Jacques!

1244
02:29:13,328 --> 02:29:15,830
Come back, Jacques!

1245
02:29:15,914 --> 02:29:17,957
Come on!

1246
02:29:18,041 --> 02:29:20,126
(disrorted) Come on, Jacques!

1247
02:29:38,478 --> 02:29:40,939
(disrorted voices)

1248
02:29:44,734 --> 02:29:47,237
Jacques! Stay with us!

1249
02:30:07,966 --> 02:30:10,051
(violenr howl)

1250
02:30:12,220 --> 02:30:14,305
- (Jacques gags)
- Good. Good.

1251
02:30:14,389 --> 02:30:16,891
Good boy.

1252
02:30:21,896 --> 02:30:23,982
Very good.

1253
02:30:43,752 --> 02:30:45,837
Here.

1254
02:30:50,133 --> 02:30:52,218
Better to sleep.

1255
02:31:12,447 --> 02:31:14,532
We'll talk later.

1256
02:31:17,535 --> 02:31:19,621
You sleep now.

1257
02:31:30,924 --> 02:31:33,009
(whispers) I love you.

1258
02:31:39,641 --> 02:31:43,353
Doctor Laurence... This just arrived for you.

1259
02:32:05,500 --> 02:32:07,585
I wasn't on the boat.

1260
02:32:13,842 --> 02:32:15,927
The only time in 20 years...

1261
02:32:18,680 --> 02:32:20,765
