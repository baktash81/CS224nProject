Dead end? Oh, come on,
tell me the truth.

What's down there?

190
00:09:05,096 --> 00:09:06,304
Nothing for young ladies

the uptown canals.

192
00:09:07,823 --> 00:09:09,479
That's sewer 237.

194
00:09:12,931 --> 00:09:14,312

195
00:09:14,312 --> 00:09:17,280
I thought there's nothing
to be afraid of down here.

00:09:22,527 --> 00:09:24,529
I don't want him
to hear US.

202
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:27,532
Life can be drier than
a chewed-on catfish bone.

203
00:09:27,532 --> 00:09:29,499
That beast could have
swallowed US whole.

That's Jean-Paul,
the canalligator.

205

there's no stopping him.

207
00:09:37,818 --> 00:09:39,544
Sure. And if he
starts yapping,

208
00:09:39,544 --> 00:09:41,408
he'll talk you to death.

209
00:09:42,443 --> 00:09:44,894
Otherwise,
he's a good gator.

to get out of here.

Because of me,

00:15:23,992 --> 00:15:26,235
so how can you say
what he's like?

368
00:15:26,235 --> 00:15:27,788
Hmph.

369
00:15:27,788 --> 00:15:29,790
[Grunting]

370
00:15:38,592 --> 00:15:40,801
Oh, I got to finish
this sand castle

371
00:15:40,801 --> 00:15:42,010
if it's the last thing
I do.

372
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:43,770
I am gonna finish
this sand castle.

373
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:46,324
[Grunting]

374
00:15:46,324 --> 00:15:48,188
I dig makin' sand castles.

375
00:15:48,188 --> 00:15:50,950
Dig! Uh, yeah. Mm.

376
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,641
[Grunting]

377
00:15:52,641 --> 00:15:55,989
Hi, dad.
What you working on?

378
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:57,749
All-new batch
of sand castle.

379
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:58,854
Sand castle 107.

380
00:15:58,854 --> 00:16:00,890
It's exactly
the same as 87.

381
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:03,272
Now, 106, well,
it was a little off,

382
00:16:03,272 --> 00:16:05,930
but certainly better
than number 76,

383
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:10,176
but 24--oh,
my dream castle.

384
00:16:10,176 --> 00:16:13,075
24 was perfection.

385
00:16:13,075 --> 00:16:14,835
Perfection.

386
00:16:14,835 --> 00:16:16,837
Wonderful, dad. Really.

387
00:16:16,837 --> 00:16:18,287
Uhh.

388
00:16:18,287 --> 00:16:20,255
Want to join me?

389
00:16:20,255 --> 00:16:21,981
Maybe later, dad!

390
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:25,191
Mommy, when are we
gonna eat?

391
00:16:25,191 --> 00:16:28,125
Daddy says we're
hangin' by threads.

392
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,990
And we like
hanging by threads.

393
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,577
I'm hungry!

394
00:16:32,577 --> 00:16:34,338
Where's my food?

395
00:16:34,338 --> 00:16:35,615
I miss monty.

396
00:16:35,615 --> 00:16:37,755
Yes, I miss
your brother, too,

397
00:16:37,755 --> 00:16:39,308
but he has things to do.

398
00:16:39,308 --> 00:16:41,621
When will I have
things to do like monty?

399
00:16:41,621 --> 00:16:42,760
When you're old enough.

400
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,588
Not fair.

401
00:16:43,588 --> 00:16:47,523
Wait. Oh, wait.

402
00:16:47,523 --> 00:16:50,837
Could he maybe
have gone down to the dock

403
00:16:50,837 --> 00:16:52,873
to meet aunt Charlotte?

404
00:16:52,873 --> 00:16:54,530
[Children laughing]

405
00:17:00,571 --> 00:17:03,746
Hey! Aunt Charlotte!
Over here!

406
00:17:03,746 --> 00:17:06,404
Monty, I knew you'd
be here to meet me.

407
00:17:06,404 --> 00:17:07,647
Here I come.

408
00:17:07,647 --> 00:17:09,545
Ah.

409
00:17:09,545 --> 00:17:10,995
Mm.

410
00:17:10,995 --> 00:17:13,722
How long has it been
since I last saw you?

411
00:17:13,722 --> 00:17:15,827
Was it before rio?

412
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:19,693
Or was it when I came back
from Jamaica?

413
00:17:19,693 --> 00:17:21,661
Oh, monty,
being a ship's rat

414
00:17:21,661 --> 00:17:23,870
is the best thing
in the world.

415
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:27,667
You ought to consider taking
a trip with your girlfriend.

416
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:31,050
Girlfriend? But I don't
have a girlfriend.

417
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,361
Come, now.

418
00:17:32,361 --> 00:17:35,813
Your aunt Charlotte
knows many, many things,

419
00:17:35,813 --> 00:17:39,196
and I can tell
that you are smitten.

420
00:17:39,196 --> 00:17:41,750
Well, i--
you're right as usual.

421
00:17:43,683 --> 00:17:46,099
Aw, monty,
every time I see you,

422
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:48,791
I think of your uncle monty,
my monty.

423
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:51,311
Pity he's still lost
in his own little world.

424
00:17:51,311 --> 00:17:53,417
He never liked to travel
because he could fly

425
00:17:53,417 --> 00:17:56,972
so much higher and faster
by using his own imagination.

426
00:17:56,972 --> 00:17:59,664
Me, I have the heart
of a ship's rat.

427
00:17:59,664 --> 00:18:02,219
I like to travel,
and as kipling said,

428
00:18:02,219 --> 00:18:03,772
"never the twain
shall meet."

429
00:18:03,772 --> 00:18:05,118
So that's why
you're not together?

430
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:08,087
Because you wanted to
travel and he didn't?

431
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,089
It was a long time ago,

432
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,815
and I don't believe
in living in the past.

433
00:18:12,815 --> 00:18:15,335
That's just the way
it goes sometimes.

434
00:18:15,335 --> 00:18:20,547
Oh, but did you know he made
this silver ring for me?

435
00:18:20,547 --> 00:18:23,274
Wow. It's beautiful.

436
00:18:27,796 --> 00:18:30,626
Those yellow ribbons
remind me of...

437
00:18:30,626 --> 00:18:32,801
You really like
this girl, don't you?

438
00:18:32,801 --> 00:18:34,009
I guess I do.

439
00:18:34,009 --> 00:18:37,116
Then give her time.
She'll come round.

440
00:18:47,747 --> 00:18:50,715
Look, monty, I brought
a present for you--

441
00:18:50,715 --> 00:18:53,925
these shells from
an Indian shaman I met

442
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:55,651
at an aztec ruins.

443
00:18:55,651 --> 00:18:58,171
I thought you might
like to paint on them.

444
00:18:58,171 --> 00:18:59,724
Cool. Thanks.

445
00:18:59,724 --> 00:19:01,519
I had a feeling
from the shaman

446
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:05,282
that they're special,
important somehow.

447
00:19:05,282 --> 00:19:07,007
I'm sure they're wonderful.

448
00:19:07,007 --> 00:19:10,079
Well, I hope you
enjoy them, hon.

449
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:12,461
I'll start painting them
later tonight.

450
00:19:12,461 --> 00:19:13,497
Bye.

451
00:19:13,497 --> 00:19:14,463
Bye-bye.

452
00:19:21,884 --> 00:19:24,370
Monty, is that you?

453
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:26,268
Oh, uh, hi.

454
00:19:26,268 --> 00:19:28,132
Come on, lad,
don't be shy.

455
00:19:28,132 --> 00:19:31,549
The grand rat chat
needs decisive young rats.

456
00:19:31,549 --> 00:19:33,896
Leave him alone, Walter.

457
00:19:33,896 --> 00:19:35,312
You do want to come
to the meeting,

458
00:19:35,312 --> 00:19:36,554
don't you, my boy?

459
00:19:36,554 --> 00:19:39,833
Well,
I'm not so sure.

460
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,490
You see?

461
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,389
The grand rat chat
is the backbone

462
00:19:43,389 --> 00:19:45,184
of our democ-rat-cy.

463
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,600
I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

464
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,258
Well, all right.
I guess so.

465
00:19:54,745 --> 00:19:56,712
[Crowd chattering]

466
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,927
Here we are.

467
00:20:04,927 --> 00:20:06,170
[Gasps]

468
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:10,174
What's the name of that girl
with the yellow ribbon?

469
00:20:10,174 --> 00:20:12,487
That's Isabella noble-rat,
our president's daughter.

470
00:20:12,487 --> 00:20:14,489
And far too good
for you my boy,

471
00:20:14,489 --> 00:20:15,835
so forget about her.

472
00:20:15,835 --> 00:20:17,457
On her left
is her father,

473
00:20:17,457 --> 00:20:18,941
president
Hugo noble-rat.

474
00:20:18,941 --> 00:20:21,323
And his advisors
Jerry mumble-rat,

475
00:20:21,323 --> 00:20:23,187
finance minister
stingy-rat,

476
00:20:23,187 --> 00:20:25,983
and crisis minister
Carl ladida.

477
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,536
My friends,

478
00:20:27,536 --> 00:20:29,331
the government
is now prepared

479
00:20:29,331 --> 00:20:31,506
to deal
with the toxic scourge

480
00:20:31,506 --> 00:20:34,163
that threatens
all our lives.

481
00:20:34,163 --> 00:20:37,339
Let me say it
loud and clear.

482
00:20:37,339 --> 00:20:40,584
We must stand together.
Are you with me?

483
00:20:40,584 --> 00:20:41,999
[Crowd chattering]

484
00:20:41,999 --> 00:20:46,383
He says the same rubbish
every speech.

485
00:20:46,383 --> 00:20:48,799
[Sniffing]

486
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,112
It's that
stuck-up ladida.

487
00:20:52,112 --> 00:20:53,597
Coming through.

488
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:56,910
Mm. Step aside.

489
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:59,775
My, my,
laurat ladida.

490
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,536
My dear rats,

491
00:21:01,536 --> 00:21:04,263
you've elected me,
and that's why I'm here,

492
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,713
to tell you what we--
you must do.

493
00:21:06,713 --> 00:21:08,681
Hello, Isabella.

494
00:21:08,681 --> 00:21:10,061
[Kissing]

495
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:11,131
[Laughs]
Laurat.

496
00:21:11,131 --> 00:21:12,616
To explain
how we're planning

497
00:21:12,616 --> 00:21:14,756
to attack the foul scourge,

498
00:21:14,756 --> 00:21:17,690
I now give you
our crisis minister,

499
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,485
Carl ladida.

500
00:21:19,485 --> 00:21:22,522
Toxins
already everywhere!

501
00:21:22,522 --> 00:21:24,869
Quiet!

502
00:21:24,869 --> 00:21:25,939
Ahem.

503
00:21:25,939 --> 00:21:28,425
We're investigating
isolated cases

504
00:21:28,425 --> 00:21:31,531
of contamination
along the wharf.

505
00:21:31,531 --> 00:21:34,223
We're establishing
a crisis commission.

506
00:21:34,223 --> 00:21:35,397
Trust me.

507
00:21:35,397 --> 00:21:37,088
Everything's
under control.

508
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:39,159
Nothing's
under control!

509
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:42,059
[Crowd yelling]

510
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:44,061
Come on, rudi.
I got something to say.

511
00:21:44,061 --> 00:21:45,718
We'll be recommending
precautionary measures,

512
00:21:45,718 --> 00:21:47,064
setting new boundaries.

513
00:21:47,064 --> 00:21:48,237
They're all idiots.

514
00:21:48,237 --> 00:21:49,929
Hey, let's raid
garbage cans.

515
00:21:49,929 --> 00:21:52,103
We're all gonna die!

516
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:54,451
Come on,
get out of my way.

517
00:21:57,143 --> 00:21:58,662
Listen, rats.

518
00:21:58,662 --> 00:22:01,941
Who owns the wharf?
The human named dollart,

519
00:22:01,941 --> 00:22:05,807
and he wants to wipe out
every one of you wharf rats.

520
00:22:05,807 --> 00:22:09,362
His men are spraying a chemical
called rat-away xgs

521
00:22:09,362 --> 00:22:10,812
into every rat hole.

522
00:22:10,812 --> 00:22:12,296
Your homes will be destroyed

523
00:22:12,296 --> 00:22:14,298
to make way
for a parking lot.

524
00:22:14,298 --> 00:22:15,299
He's lyin'!

525
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:17,094
You rats
don't stand a chance.

526
00:22:17,094 --> 00:22:18,647
That's monty mad-rat!

527
00:22:18,647 --> 00:22:19,786
You're
both drunk!

528
00:22:19,786 --> 00:22:22,237
He certainly
ain't no wharf rat.

529
00:22:22,237 --> 00:22:26,275
Listen, there's only one way
to stop dollart in his tracks.

530
00:22:26,275 --> 00:22:27,622
How do you know?

531
00:22:27,622 --> 00:22:28,657
Money!

532
00:22:28,657 --> 00:22:30,970
It's all about money,
you helpless fools.

533
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:32,247
Money's
the only language

534
00:22:32,247 --> 00:22:35,492
those foul humans
understand.

535
00:22:35,492 --> 00:22:37,666
You want to get
rid of dollart,

536
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:39,944
buy him out,
pay him cash.

537
00:22:39,944 --> 00:22:41,601
Ain't that
rudi rake-rat?

538
00:22:41,601 --> 00:22:43,638
He does business
with humans!

539
00:22:43,638 --> 00:22:46,399
Rudi rake-rat escaped
from a laboratory!

540
00:22:46,399 --> 00:22:48,436
Push that old mad-rat
out of here!

541
00:22:48,436 --> 00:22:50,990
When somebody finally
tells the truth,

542
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:53,199
no one listens.

543
00:22:53,199 --> 00:22:55,581
These wharf rats
are boneheads.

544
00:22:55,581 --> 00:22:57,065
Let's go, rudi.

545
00:22:57,065 --> 00:22:58,480

[Crowd shouting]

547
00:23:05,798 --> 00:23:08,456
That shrimp's called
monty mad-rat, too.

[Gasps] Monty?

549
00:23:11,562 --> 00:23:15,048
I've heard enough.
I'm out of here.

Mad-rat?

551
00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:19,639
My dear friends,
here's what I propose.

552
00:23:19,639 --> 00:23:21,710
We'll set up
a rescue committee.

553
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:25,887
I hereby found rat rescue,
r.R. For short.

554
00:23:25,887 --> 00:23:30,098
We--uh, you rats of Manhattan
must collect money.

555
00:23:30,098 --> 00:23:33,239
Our goal--$100,000.

556
00:23:33,239 --> 00:23:35,310
Now look
who's a mad-rat.

557
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,449
Let him talk!

558
00:23:36,449 --> 00:23:38,071
With the money,

559
00:23:38,071 --> 00:23:41,143
we'll buy back the wharves
from the human.

560
00:23:41,143 --> 00:23:43,387
It's the only way.

561
00:23:43,387 --> 00:23:46,183
That's how the world works,
my friends.

562
00:23:46,183 --> 00:23:48,565
The most important thing
for US to do

563
00:23:48,565 --> 00:23:51,602
is scrounge for as much
money as possible.

564
00:23:51,602 --> 00:23:54,847
Our drain-cleaning activities
must stop immediately.

565
00:23:54,847 --> 00:23:57,332
President
noble-rat's right!

566
00:23:57,332 --> 00:23:59,092
Bravo! Bravo!

567
00:23:59,092 --> 00:24:00,197
Let's do it!

568
00:24:01,992 --> 00:24:04,512
It's money
down the drains!

569
00:24:04,512 --> 00:24:07,480
Noble-rat,
a word of caution.

570
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,345
We need our pack rats
down in the sewers.

571
00:24:10,345 --> 00:24:13,072
It's absolutely critical
to our survival.

572
00:24:13,072 --> 00:24:16,282
Our lives depend upon
the water not rising

573
00:24:16,282 --> 00:24:18,940
so it won't wipe out
our homes.

574
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,390
And let's not forget
about our search

575
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,289
for the healing
aloe ve-rat.

576
00:24:23,289 --> 00:24:24,980
That must wait
for now, doc.

577
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,257
One problem at a time.

578
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:30,089
I hereby declare

582
00:24:35,784 --> 00:24:38,166
'cause we got to
find it fast.

583
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:40,064
We'll stop the human dollart

584
00:24:40,064 --> 00:24:42,032
before he does US in.

585
00:24:42,032 --> 00:24:44,137
We'll buy him
with our money.

586
00:24:44,137 --> 00:24:45,829
We'll pay him off at last.

587
00:24:45,829 --> 00:24:47,900
We'll bribe
that greedy human,

589
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:51,731
We'll cover him with money.

590
00:24:51,731 --> 00:24:53,802
We'll buy him off
with cash.

591
00:24:53,802 --> 00:24:55,666
We'll bribe
that greedy dollart.

592
00:24:55,666 --> 00:24:57,737
We'll all be free at last!

593
00:24:57,737 --> 00:24:59,463

00:25:10,336 --> 00:25:11,337
In that case...

597
00:25:11,337 --> 00:25:12,856
Whoa!

598
00:25:12,856 --> 00:25:13,995
Stop all work?

599
00:25:13,995 --> 00:25:15,341
Yeah, we're supposed
to stop work

600
00:25:15,341 --> 00:25:16,480
and collect money instead.

601
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,550
Who'll keep
the sewers clean?

602
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,862
I don't know,
but the president ordered it.

603
00:25:18,862 --> 00:25:20,104
What do you think
they're up to?

604
00:25:20,104 --> 00:25:21,485
Sounds kind of
important to me.

00:31:30,612 --> 00:31:32,269
Oh! Ohh!

724
00:31:32,269 --> 00:31:33,822
Oh, somebody,
help me!

725
00:31:33,822 --> 00:31:36,618
Allie, don't
just stand there!

726
00:31:36,618 --> 00:31:38,482
Go fetch the doctor!

727
00:31:38,482 --> 00:31:39,932
He's right next door.

728
00:31:39,932 --> 00:31:41,313
What's your name?

729
00:31:41,313 --> 00:31:44,074
Montague mad-rat...
Sir. Monty.

730
00:31:44,074 --> 00:31:45,351
I--i just thought--

731
00:31:45,351 --> 00:31:47,146
no! No! No!

732
00:31:47,146 --> 00:31:50,425
That rat there is mad,
I tell you!

733
00:31:50,425 --> 00:31:51,910
You're not welcome here!

734
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,601
Ohh! No!

735
00:31:53,601 --> 00:31:56,638
What is it?
What's wrong now?

736
00:31:56,638 --> 00:31:58,433
It's the toxin scourge!

737
00:31:58,433 --> 00:32:00,159
He looks so sick.

738
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:02,990
This is the last
of the antidote.

739
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:04,543
Laurat is lucky.

740
00:32:04,543 --> 00:32:06,855
He'll get better,
by hippo-rat.

741
00:32:06,855 --> 00:32:09,686
But now we're all
in jeopardy.

742
00:32:09,686 --> 00:32:11,550
It's a catastrophe.

743
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:12,689
Without the aloe ve-rat,

744
00:32:12,689 --> 00:32:14,484
I don't know
what we'll do.

745
00:32:14,484 --> 00:32:15,726
Let's search for it.

746
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:17,211
No one's available.

747
00:32:17,211 --> 00:32:18,522
How can that be?

748
00:32:18,522 --> 00:32:20,386
They're looking
for money.

749
00:32:20,386 --> 00:32:22,526
Oh, yuck!

750
00:32:22,526 --> 00:32:23,838
Dad,
what are you doing?

751
00:32:23,838 --> 00:32:26,530
I'm getting rid of that
mad-rat's useless junk.

752
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:27,876
But you can't do that.

753
00:32:27,876 --> 00:32:29,050
Can and will.

754
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:31,708
Have you forgotten
that I am the president?

755
00:32:31,708 --> 00:32:32,709
No, daddy.

756
00:32:32,709 --> 00:32:33,813
I shall do exactly--

757
00:32:33,813 --> 00:32:35,332
they're
truly beautiful.

758
00:32:35,332 --> 00:32:37,369
Isabella!
I have work to do.

759
00:32:37,369 --> 00:32:39,198
I don't have time
for this.

760
00:32:39,198 --> 00:32:41,373
The others will be here
any minute, and I want to be--

761
00:32:41,373 --> 00:32:42,374
oh, the others?

762
00:32:42,374 --> 00:32:43,962
They don't like monty,
either.

763
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,135
What you're doing
is wrong.

764
00:32:45,135 --> 00:32:47,862
Those shells belong
to monty. And besides--

765
00:32:47,862 --> 00:32:49,795
Isabella noble-rat!

766
00:32:49,795 --> 00:32:51,728
I'll not be spoken to
that way.

767
00:32:51,728 --> 00:32:53,178
Now throw that trash
into the hole.

768
00:32:53,178 --> 00:32:54,800
No, I won't!
I can't!

769
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,596
Young lady, I will not
have you defend a sewer rat

770
00:32:57,596 --> 00:33:00,219
while showing
such disrespect to me.

771
00:33:00,219 --> 00:33:01,289
Why, I've never--

772
00:33:01,289 --> 00:33:03,878
hey, daddy, isn't
there money missing

773
00:33:03,878 --> 00:33:05,052
from your collection?

774
00:33:05,052 --> 00:33:07,744
Where?
That can't be right.

775
00:33:07,744 --> 00:33:09,228
Why, I just
counted it myself.

776
00:33:09,228 --> 00:33:11,990
Show me
where it's missing.

777
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:15,303
[Laughing] Well,
there's nothing missing.

778
00:33:15,303 --> 00:33:16,891
It's all--

779
00:33:16,891 --> 00:33:17,996
Isabella!

780
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,756
Where did you go?

781
00:33:19,756 --> 00:33:20,791
Where?

782
00:33:26,728 --> 00:33:29,317
I am not afraid
of the sewer.

783
00:33:29,317 --> 00:33:31,285
I like it down here.

784
00:33:31,285 --> 00:33:33,149
Really, I do.

785
00:33:35,461 --> 00:33:38,533
I do li--i do, I do.

786
00:33:38,533 --> 00:33:40,742
Doesn't bother me one bit.

787
00:33:40,742 --> 00:33:42,330
No way.

788
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:44,505
I'm all right.

789
00:33:44,505 --> 00:33:45,747
Oh, my.

790
00:33:51,891 --> 00:33:53,307
I'll be fine.

791
00:33:53,307 --> 00:33:55,447
I will be fine.

792
00:33:55,447 --> 00:33:57,311
And I'll do just fine.

793
00:33:59,485 --> 00:34:01,039
Which way?

794
00:34:16,433 --> 00:34:18,470
[Roar]

795
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:21,576
[Squeaking]
Aah!

796
00:34:21,576 --> 00:34:23,578
Jean-Paul thought
all you rats

797
00:34:23,578 --> 00:34:25,028
had left for
high ground, no?

798
00:34:25,028 --> 00:34:29,205
You're trembling.
Are you cold?

799
00:34:29,205 --> 00:34:32,242
Please don't hurt me,
Mr. Gator.

800
00:34:32,242 --> 00:34:34,244
The only thing
being hurt here

801
00:34:34,244 --> 00:34:36,453
is Jean-Paul's
feelings.

802
00:34:36,453 --> 00:34:39,180
I mean you no harm.

803
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:41,941
In fact, I rather
enjoy company.

804
00:34:41,941 --> 00:34:44,461
I'm so lonely.

805
00:34:44,461 --> 00:34:49,466
Ok. I'm on my way to find
old monty mad-rat.

806
00:34:49,466 --> 00:34:53,229
You know, the one
who deals with humans.

807
00:34:53,229 --> 00:34:54,782
Ah, oui,
monty the elder

808
00:34:54,782 --> 00:34:56,749
from under the museum
of modern art.

809
00:34:56,749 --> 00:34:59,235
You come
a strange way, no?

810
00:34:59,235 --> 00:35:02,859
Lucky for you
you're only half lost,

811
00:35:02,859 --> 00:35:04,378
but unlucky for you,

812
00:35:04,378 --> 00:35:08,934
there's absolutely
no earthly way back

813
00:35:08,934 --> 00:35:11,488
from sewer 237.

814
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:16,286
So this--
this is sewer 237?

815
00:35:18,461 --> 00:35:21,153
It's horrible.

816
00:35:21,153 --> 00:35:25,951
Sewer 237 is
the final resting place

817
00:35:25,951 --> 00:35:28,747
for rejected pets.

818
00:35:28,747 --> 00:35:29,989
Do you see?

819
00:35:29,989 --> 00:35:31,922
So let me guess.

820
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:34,925
Next you're gonna
tell me you're a pet.

821
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:38,619
Mais oui.
But a long time ago,

822
00:35:38,619 --> 00:35:41,380
when Jean-Paul
was just a tiny gator,

823
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:45,833
my owner flushed me
down the drain. Kaboosh!

824
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:48,698
As we used to say
in Louisiana,

825
00:35:48,698 --> 00:35:50,355
that's life
in the swamp.

826
00:35:50,355 --> 00:35:54,082
But it's not too bad
living down here.

827
00:35:54,082 --> 00:35:57,707
I don't mind,
but I don't get cable,

828
00:35:57,707 --> 00:36:01,366
and the reception, she's
not so good underground.

829
00:36:01,366 --> 00:36:04,403
You're awfully lively for
someone living in a graveyard.

830
00:36:04,403 --> 00:36:08,959
You are very perceptive,
ma chererat.

831
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:12,411
Come. Let's have
a little gabfest.

832
00:36:12,411 --> 00:36:15,966
We certainly could
talk about my tail.

833
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:19,729
It's getting whiter
and whiter by the year.

834
00:36:19,729 --> 00:36:21,144
Then get out
into the sun.

835
00:36:21,144 --> 00:36:25,459
Mm-mm. Jean-Paul does
not care for the sun.

836
00:36:25,459 --> 00:36:28,634
Jean-Paul likes
the cool of the canal.

837
00:36:34,778 --> 00:36:38,472
[Humming]

838
00:36:38,472 --> 00:36:42,061
Jean-Paul,
where are you going?

839
00:36:42,061 --> 00:36:43,270
Jean-Paul!

840
00:36:49,586 --> 00:36:52,831
Jean-Paul, look,
I'm in a major hurry.

841
00:36:52,831 --> 00:36:55,005
Which way is the museum?

842
00:36:55,005 --> 00:36:58,492
Why are rats always
in such a big rush?

843
00:36:58,492 --> 00:37:01,874
Scurrying about like
they're on hot coals.

844
00:37:01,874 --> 00:37:06,776
Life is too short.
Come along, ma chererat.

845
00:37:06,776 --> 00:37:10,158
We'll have our little chat
along the way.

846
00:37:10,158 --> 00:37:12,816
[Sighs]

847
00:37:16,164 --> 00:37:18,615
Oh, Isabella.

848
00:37:20,859 --> 00:37:22,101
Notice anything?

849
00:37:22,101 --> 00:37:25,001
Yes. That you never
stop talking.

850
00:37:25,001 --> 00:37:26,520
The water's rising.

851
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,694
It's raining outside.

852
00:37:28,694 --> 00:37:31,352
Exactement.
Yet the canal,

853
00:37:31,352 --> 00:37:35,460
it should not flood in
the rain. Mmm, mmm, no.

854
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,910
Jean-Paul!

855
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:41,535
Not if you rats were
keeping the drains clear

856
00:37:41,535 --> 00:37:43,053
instead of
gathering money.

857
00:37:43,053 --> 00:37:46,056
Jean-Paul, when you
dawdle like that,

858
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:49,197
I can't carry on
with the conversation.

859
00:37:49,197 --> 00:37:52,718
Mon dieu.I'll be
quiet as a mouse.

860
00:38:17,433 --> 00:38:22,265
So, let me see,
5 rings at $100 a pop,

861
00:38:22,265 --> 00:38:24,025
is 500 bucks.

862
00:38:24,025 --> 00:38:26,821
Divided by 2, um...

863
00:38:26,821 --> 00:38:29,307
Oh, that makes
400 big ones for me,

864
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,239
and the other half for you.

865
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:35,451
Oh, rudi, those humans have
really dulled your thinking

866
00:38:35,451 --> 00:38:37,625
with all their experiments.

867
00:38:37,625 --> 00:38:39,765
Ratwash! I've been
clinically tested.

868
00:38:39,765 --> 00:38:42,630
My thinking is clear as cotton,
which is more than you can say.

869
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:44,632
[Chuckles]

870
00:38:44,632 --> 00:38:47,704
I'll never make a decent
rat out of you again.

871
00:38:47,704 --> 00:38:52,537
I'd prefer a decent payday.
Money talks, you know.

872
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:11,038
Left? Right?
Straight ahead?

873
00:39:11,038 --> 00:39:13,627
Up or down?
Which way?

874
00:39:13,627 --> 00:39:16,595
Ma chererat,
there is no one right way.

875
00:39:16,595 --> 00:39:19,149
Wherever you are is
where you should be, no?

876
00:39:19,149 --> 00:39:21,704
This then must be
the right place.

877
00:39:21,704 --> 00:39:23,395
What?

878
00:39:23,395 --> 00:39:24,776
[Faint noises]

879
00:39:24,776 --> 00:39:26,260
This is it?

880
00:39:29,194 --> 00:39:31,265
Hey, what's
that noise?

881
00:39:31,265 --> 00:39:35,096
Old monty and rudi. You were
in a hurry to find them.

882
00:39:35,096 --> 00:39:37,961
Yes, I am, but which
pipe do I take?

883
00:39:37,961 --> 00:39:40,826
He who seeks finds.

884
00:39:40,826 --> 00:39:43,104
Or as we say down
in the bayou--

885
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:45,003
Jean-Paul, please!

886
00:39:45,003 --> 00:39:46,522
You trust Jean-Paul?

887
00:39:46,522 --> 00:39:47,937
Yes! Just tell me
which way to go!

888
00:39:47,937 --> 00:39:52,079
This way or that.
No matter which way you choose,

889
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,322
you'll always be taking
the correct pipe.

890
00:39:54,322 --> 00:39:55,703
Knock it off!

891
00:39:55,703 --> 00:39:59,604
There are no shortcuts.
You're so excitable.

892
00:39:59,604 --> 00:40:00,846
You're driving
me nuts!

893
00:40:00,846 --> 00:40:04,712
Aw, you're no fun.
No fun at all.

894
00:40:04,712 --> 00:40:08,751
Take the broken pipe.
Or as we say in Louisiana--

895
00:40:08,751 --> 00:40:10,511
see you later,
canalligator.

896
00:40:13,687 --> 00:40:16,655
Chase after
good fortune,

897
00:40:16,655 --> 00:40:20,728
but don't go too fast
now, you hear?

898
00:40:20,728 --> 00:40:23,075
The word on the street
is bad.

899
00:40:23,075 --> 00:40:25,077
More spraying by the hour.

900
00:40:25,077 --> 00:40:27,045
Serves 'em right,
all those harbor snobs.

901
00:40:27,045 --> 00:40:30,980
Mmm! Mr. Mad-rat,
you've got to help US!

902
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:33,845
Look, I've got
something for you.

903
00:40:33,845 --> 00:40:35,363
Ah, the president's
daughter.

904
00:40:35,363 --> 00:40:38,332
So you've all come
to your senses, have you?

905
00:40:38,332 --> 00:40:39,920
Care for a drink?

906
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,955
No, thanks.

907
00:40:40,955 --> 00:40:43,717
My father has
no idea I'm here.

908
00:40:43,717 --> 00:40:46,858
But I've got the perfect
idea for rat rescue.

909
00:40:46,858 --> 00:40:48,549
And why should
we help you with it?

910
00:40:48,549 --> 00:40:49,826
Because you're
the only ones who can.

911
00:40:49,826 --> 00:40:51,828
We desperately
need money.

912
00:40:51,828 --> 00:40:55,453
Well, aren't we special?
Lucky US.

913
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,972
You're looking
for our money?

914
00:40:57,972 --> 00:41:00,492
You've come to
the wrong address, lady.

915
00:41:00,492 --> 00:41:01,597
We're artists.

916
00:41:01,597 --> 00:41:04,634
Dollart's trucks are
spraying every rat hole.

917
00:41:04,634 --> 00:41:07,741
My fiancá is fatally
ill. We'll all die!

918
00:41:07,741 --> 00:41:10,571
If you want heroes,
try the next gutter over.

919
00:41:10,571 --> 00:41:11,745
What can we
do about it?

920
00:41:11,745 --> 00:41:14,851
I heard you had
contact with humans.

921
00:41:14,851 --> 00:41:16,197
Humans that buy art.

922
00:41:16,197 --> 00:41:17,198
Subway!

923
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:19,546
Oh!

924
00:41:19,546 --> 00:41:22,480
[Coughing]

925
00:41:26,553 --> 00:41:28,934
This is weird
down here.

926
00:41:28,934 --> 00:41:31,109
[Coughing]

927
00:41:31,109 --> 00:41:34,630
Weird only by your standards.
To US, it's home.

928
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:37,149
Yes, we're friendly
with one human.

929
00:41:37,149 --> 00:41:40,774
The gallery owner,
Mrs. Jellybelly, gives US pins,

930
00:41:40,774 --> 00:41:42,258
and I decorate them.

931
00:41:42,258 --> 00:41:45,364
Is it so wrong to make
friends of enemies?

932
00:41:45,364 --> 00:41:48,195
What have you got
for US in there?

933
00:41:48,195 --> 00:41:50,508
Hey! Keep your
grubby paws off!

934
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,647
Mad-rat: Rudi!

935
00:41:51,647 --> 00:41:53,511
Here.

936
00:41:55,167 --> 00:41:58,723
This shell was painted by
a young rat from the Hudson.

937
00:41:58,723 --> 00:42:02,589
He could be related to you.
He's also called mad-rat.

938
00:42:02,589 --> 00:42:04,936
Ah, my nephew monty.
Do you remember, rudi?

939
00:42:04,936 --> 00:42:07,283
The wharf rat
in the bank vault.

940
00:42:07,283 --> 00:42:10,907
This painting is excellent,
but I'm curious.

941
00:42:10,907 --> 00:42:13,461
Where did he get this shell?

942
00:42:13,461 --> 00:42:14,980
Are you kidding me?

943
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:16,982
You're not taking
that trinket upstairs?

944
00:42:16,982 --> 00:42:18,052
This is art!

945
00:42:18,052 --> 00:42:20,468
Besides, we can't go
to the gallery today.

946
00:42:20,468 --> 00:42:23,886
Anyway, it's
waytoo dangerous.

947
00:42:23,886 --> 00:42:25,715
But we have
to raise the money!

948
00:42:25,715 --> 00:42:27,993
All our lives
depend on it!

949
00:42:27,993 --> 00:42:30,375
You got any
more of these?

950
00:42:30,375 --> 00:42:31,445
2 more.

951
00:42:31,445 --> 00:42:34,068
Well, miss bauble-rat--

952
00:42:34,068 --> 00:42:36,070
that's noble-rat!

953
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:38,556
Leave them here and I'll--
we'll take them to the gallery

954
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,247
on Monday.

955
00:42:40,247 --> 00:42:42,007
But you'll be lucky
to get 10 cents for them.

956
00:42:42,007 --> 00:42:45,424
Monday?! We'll be
cooked by Monday!

957
00:42:45,424 --> 00:42:48,462
We'll be cooked today if we do
what miss trouble-rat asks for!

958
00:42:48,462 --> 00:42:50,844
We rats must
stick together.

959
00:42:50,844 --> 00:42:51,845
Yeah. Right.

960
00:42:51,845 --> 00:42:53,640
Don't forget that.
The human jellybelly

961
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,263
is only alone in
her gallery on mondays.

962
00:42:56,263 --> 00:42:59,542
Today there will be others.
It's a terribly big risk.

963
00:42:59,542 --> 00:43:01,855
It's the
ultimate risk!

964
00:43:01,855 --> 00:43:03,857
If you're too afraid
to go, I'll go alone,

965
00:43:03,857 --> 00:43:05,513
and I'm a noble-rat!

966
00:43:05,513 --> 00:43:07,550
Listen, miss
double-trouble rat,

967
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:09,552
I'll sell your souvenirs,
but we'll be lucky

968
00:43:09,552 --> 00:43:11,830
not to end up in some cat's
Swiss cheese sandwich.

969
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:13,625
Souvenirs?!

970
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:16,145
Why, you shaggy weasel
of a lab rat!

971
00:43:16,145 --> 00:43:18,906
I'm not that stupid.
You're just after my money!

972
00:43:18,906 --> 00:43:22,600
And you're nothing but
a puffed-up wharf rat Princess!

973
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,326
Keep your precious
sea food Picasso trash!

974
00:43:25,326 --> 00:43:27,708
Incoming!

975
00:43:30,262 --> 00:43:33,300
Oh! What have you done?

976
00:43:38,788 --> 00:43:40,445
Wow!

977
00:43:46,244 --> 00:43:49,178
Yeah! Well,
now I'm impressed.

978
00:43:49,178 --> 00:43:51,663
These shells may be worth
something after all.

979
00:43:51,663 --> 00:43:53,941
So it's well
worth the risk?

980
00:43:53,941 --> 00:43:56,564
Yes. Now, let's not
waste any more time.

981
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:05,332
[Footsteps]

982
00:44:08,576 --> 00:44:10,924
Well, hello there,
monty.

983
00:44:10,924 --> 00:44:13,823
I'm so glad I managed
to bump into you again

984
00:44:13,823 --> 00:44:15,963
before my ship leaves.

985
00:44:15,963 --> 00:44:17,965
I'm troubled,
aunt Charlotte.

986
00:44:17,965 --> 00:44:20,312
Sounds to me like
you're having your share

987
00:44:20,312 --> 00:44:22,314
of girlfriend
problems, hmm?

988
00:44:22,314 --> 00:44:24,075
You don't know
the half of it.

989
00:44:24,075 --> 00:44:29,218
Look, monty, it's not
the end of the world.

990
00:44:29,218 --> 00:44:30,633
My life is going nowhere.

991
00:44:30,633 --> 00:44:33,740
My dad builds
sand castles all day,

992
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:35,673
my mom makes feather hats,

993
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,605
the humans
want to poison US,

994
00:44:37,605 --> 00:44:40,850
and, truthfully, Isabella's
not really my girlfriend.

995
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:42,403
But your heart's
in the right place.

996
00:44:42,403 --> 00:44:46,994
Just take matters
into your own paws.

997
00:44:46,994 --> 00:44:51,516
We missed our chance,
your uncle and me.

998
00:44:51,516 --> 00:44:54,001
We were both too young
and impatient.

999
00:44:54,001 --> 00:44:55,520
Look, listen to me.

1000
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,903
If you can't think of
what to say to Isabella,

1001
00:44:58,903 --> 00:45:00,974
then here, take my ring

1002
00:45:00,974 --> 00:45:03,977
and let it do all
the talking for you.

1003
00:45:03,977 --> 00:45:05,737
Aunt Charlotte...

1004
00:45:05,737 --> 00:45:07,566
I don't know
if I can do that.

1005
00:45:07,566 --> 00:45:09,776
Of course you can.

1006
00:45:09,776 --> 00:45:11,916
You're the best.

1007
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:21,788
[Squeaking]

1008
00:45:29,623 --> 00:45:32,902
You expect me
to get onto that thing?

1009
00:45:32,902 --> 00:45:35,974
You gonna chicken out
now, huh?

1010
00:45:35,974 --> 00:45:37,700
I don't know.

1011
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:38,770
Nothing to it.

1012
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:40,668
All right.

1013
00:45:45,121 --> 00:45:46,226
Whoa!

1014
00:45:46,226 --> 00:45:49,194
Help! Help!
Help, please!

1015
00:45:49,194 --> 00:45:50,678
Hang on!
I got your hand!

1016
00:45:50,678 --> 00:45:51,818
I'm slipping!

1017
00:45:51,818 --> 00:45:53,405
Oh, no, the shell!

1018
00:45:53,405 --> 00:45:56,236
Mad-rat: You can do it.
Don't let go!

1019
00:45:56,236 --> 00:45:57,237
Come on!

1020
00:45:57,237 --> 00:45:59,584
Oh! Oh!

1021
00:46:01,517 --> 00:46:04,831
Thanks. I must have
more lives than a cat.

1022
00:46:04,831 --> 00:46:07,316
That's just wonderful.

1023
00:46:07,316 --> 00:46:09,318
Now we can kiss a third
of our profits good-bye!

1024
00:46:17,188 --> 00:46:19,431
Hello?
Is anyone home?

1025
00:46:22,296 --> 00:46:24,643
Hello, Jean-Paul?

1026
00:46:24,643 --> 00:46:26,473
Are you there?

1027
00:46:45,181 --> 00:46:47,183
Isabella's ribbon?

1028
00:46:47,183 --> 00:46:48,702
[Gasps]

1029
00:46:50,669 --> 00:46:51,912
Isabella!

1030
00:46:55,122 --> 00:46:57,573
Isabella, where are you?

1031
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:05,098
You ok, ma'am?

1032
00:47:05,098 --> 00:47:06,962
Yes.

1033
00:47:06,962 --> 00:47:08,687
Are you
the gallerist?

1034
00:47:08,687 --> 00:47:10,448
Yes.

1035
00:47:10,448 --> 00:47:12,933
But we're busy.
Come back.

1036
00:47:12,933 --> 00:47:15,625
Later.

1037
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:17,213
Oh!

1038
00:47:17,213 --> 00:47:18,905
Never again!

1039
00:47:21,183 --> 00:47:23,116
Mmm!

1040
00:47:38,062 --> 00:47:39,063
Oh!

1041
00:47:39,063 --> 00:47:40,374
Sorry, ma'am.

1042
00:47:40,374 --> 00:47:41,479
No, no, no.

1043
00:47:41,479 --> 00:47:45,448
Don't hang the new
clearwater until tomorrow.

1044
00:47:45,448 --> 00:47:46,691
All right, boys?

1045
00:47:46,691 --> 00:47:48,037
Got it, ma'am.

1046
00:47:48,037 --> 00:47:49,107
Turn around.

1047
00:47:49,107 --> 00:47:51,213
Mmm!

1048
00:47:51,213 --> 00:47:52,939
Excuse me,
ma'am.

1049
00:48:00,601 --> 00:48:03,742
Oh! What's that?

1050
00:48:03,742 --> 00:48:06,366
I told you this
was the wrong day.

1051
00:48:06,366 --> 00:48:07,885
It's the next
hole down.

1052
00:48:15,237 --> 00:48:17,308
Quietly, rudi.

1053
00:48:17,308 --> 00:48:18,861
[Ding]

1054
00:48:18,861 --> 00:48:21,899
So, when can we talk
to this jellybelly?

1055
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:23,901
Let's check it out.

1056
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:30,217
[Meow]

1057
00:48:30,217 --> 00:48:32,875
[Meow]

1058
00:48:32,875 --> 00:48:36,016
[Meow]

1059
00:48:36,016 --> 00:48:38,777
Camouflage is everything.

1060
00:48:38,777 --> 00:48:40,641
If I wasn't such a good rat,

1061
00:48:40,641 --> 00:48:42,712
I'd make a
pretty good cat, eh?

1062
00:48:42,712 --> 00:48:44,300
Ok, jellybelly's alone.

1063
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:46,682
Then let the
negotiations begin.

1064
00:48:48,442 --> 00:48:49,857
Let me see.

1065
00:48:54,517 --> 00:48:55,518
[Ding]

1066
00:48:55,518 --> 00:48:57,106
Oh, my word!

1067
00:48:57,106 --> 00:49:00,144
You rang, miss jellybelly.
You need anything?

1068
00:49:00,144 --> 00:49:03,837
Uh, no, Nick. I'll
be there in a minute.

1069
00:49:03,837 --> 00:49:05,011
Tom:
In a minute?

1070
00:49:05,011 --> 00:49:08,186
I have things
to do, Tom.

1071
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:17,368
Let's see if
she takes the bait.

1072
00:49:17,368 --> 00:49:20,198
Uh-oh,
that's not good.

1073
00:49:20,198 --> 00:49:22,476
Oh, dear.
Now what do we do?

1074
00:49:22,476 --> 00:49:24,858
I'll try again.

1075

This is pathetic.

What are you rats up to?

1077
00:49:34,419 --> 00:49:36,697
I can't sell this.
This is unsellable.

1078

But, now, what about a nice
rat-tail silver pin?

1079

Are these real?
Let's talk.

1080

But this? Guys,
you know better than this.

And listen, only come on mondays
when the gallery's closed.

00:49:59,582 --> 00:50:03,379

It's too dangerous.

So, my fine furry friends,
how's this?

1090

What?

1091

Even if she
ponies up 40 grand,

I'm still gonna
play hardball.

is negotiate.

a method to my wacko-ness.

00:58:54,807 --> 00:58:57,775
And, Evelyn, I'll take
that sculpture for myself.

1239

As an investment.

1240
00:59:00,329 --> 00:59:01,330

00:59:20,833 --> 00:59:22,800
[Banging]

1251
00:59:31,188 --> 00:59:33,017
Uncle?

1252
00:59:33,017 --> 00:59:34,260
Uncle!

1253
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:36,780
Uncle monty, wake up!

1254
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:39,783
Oh, no, you're so cold.

1255
00:59:39,783 --> 00:59:42,268
[Grunting]

1256
00:59:46,617 --> 00:59:49,068
Ohh...

1257
00:59:49,068 --> 00:59:50,517
Mmm.

1258
00:59:50,517 --> 00:59:52,519
[Sniffing]

1259
00:59:54,245 --> 00:59:56,489
Ugh! Ew! Ew!

1260
00:59:57,490 --> 00:59:59,526
All the perfume
in fumingdale's

1261
00:59:59,526 --> 01:00:02,322
couldn't make me
smell any better now.

1262
01:00:02,322 --> 01:00:03,323
Ugh.

1263
01:00:12,954 --> 01:00:15,473
Come on, uncle monty.
Stay with me.

1264
01:00:20,755 --> 01:00:22,515
Hey, anyone
down here?

1265
01:00:22,515 --> 01:00:24,897
Monty, my friend!

1266
01:00:24,897 --> 01:00:27,037
Must you startle
people like that?

1267
01:00:27,037 --> 01:00:28,521
It's my nature, eh?

1268
01:00:28,521 --> 01:00:31,282
Things have been
so strange lately.

1269
01:00:31,282 --> 01:00:35,908
I've been up to my neck
in water for far too long.

1270
01:00:35,908 --> 01:00:38,565
And now Jean-Paul
is lonelier than ever,

1271
01:00:38,565 --> 01:00:41,603
but I'm so glad
to see you again.

1272
01:00:41,603 --> 01:00:45,642
What brings you here,
mon ami?

1273
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:50,612
Jean-Paul, I need your help.
My uncle, he's dying.

1274
01:00:50,612 --> 01:00:55,030
Oh, I see. So you want
a ride to sewer 237.

1275
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:58,931
No! Into the sun.
Quickly! To central park!

1276
01:00:58,931 --> 01:01:01,588
To the sun?

1277
01:01:01,588 --> 01:01:03,763
You gonna go
up there as well?

1278
01:01:03,763 --> 01:01:05,627
Jean-Paul, please.
Now!

1279
01:01:05,627 --> 01:01:07,905
Ok.

1280
01:01:07,905 --> 01:01:10,252
Now, don't you get
your tail in a twist.

1281
01:01:10,252 --> 01:01:12,565
Just hold on
to your uncle.

1282
01:01:12,565 --> 01:01:15,775
Now...hold on!
[Inhales deeply]

1283
01:01:46,841 --> 01:01:49,153
This bank will do fine,
Jean-Paul.

1284
01:02:01,131 --> 01:02:03,202
[Muttering]

1285
01:02:06,653 --> 01:02:10,105
There's too much junk
in my mouth.

1286
01:02:10,105 --> 01:02:11,451
Hey!

1287
01:02:11,451 --> 01:02:13,453
That's one of my shells.

1288
01:02:13,453 --> 01:02:15,145
Where did you get that?

1289
01:02:15,145 --> 01:02:16,629
Jean-Paul
can't keep track

1290
01:02:16,629 --> 01:02:18,458
of what gets stuck
in his teeth.

1291
01:02:18,458 --> 01:02:19,666
Right now,

1292
01:02:19,666 --> 01:02:22,704
the sewers are full
of strange but tasty stuff.

1293
01:02:23,809 --> 01:02:25,155
Uncle.

1294
01:02:25,155 --> 01:02:26,777
Uncle monty.

1295
01:02:27,916 --> 01:02:31,161
Jean-Paul's
in central park.

1296
01:02:31,161 --> 01:02:33,611
Amazing, no?

1297
01:02:33,611 --> 01:02:35,303
Ohh.

1298
01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:44,588
Isabella,
where have you been?

1299
01:02:44,588 --> 01:02:45,589
We're saved!

1300
01:02:45,589 --> 01:02:47,764
We've been worried
about you.

1301
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:49,973
See? I've got money.
Lots of money.

1302
01:02:49,973 --> 01:02:50,974
Money?

1303
01:02:50,974 --> 01:02:51,975
Money?!

1304
01:02:51,975 --> 01:02:53,493
Izzy, look around you.

1305
01:02:53,493 --> 01:02:55,323
The r.R. Project
has ruined US.

1306
01:02:55,323 --> 01:02:56,980
Because the drains
are backed up,

1307
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:58,498
are homes
are almost underwater.

1308
01:02:58,498 --> 01:03:00,500
Then all this running
around was for nothing?

1309
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:03,572
No. We're sending every rat
back into the sewers

1310
01:03:03,572 --> 01:03:05,574
to get the water
flowing again.

1311
01:03:05,574 --> 01:03:08,060
Where did you get
all that money?

1312
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:09,061
Hmm.

1313
01:03:09,061 --> 01:03:12,029
On the megatrip
of a lifetime.

1314
01:03:12,029 --> 01:03:13,548
It was amazing.

1315
01:03:13,548 --> 01:03:15,515
I traded
monty mad-rat's shells

1316
01:03:15,515 --> 01:03:17,034
to a human for it.

1317
01:03:17,034 --> 01:03:19,140
And we almost
didn't escape.

1318
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:20,486
Oh, Isabella,

1319
01:03:20,486 --> 01:03:23,040
endangering yourself
like that.

1320
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:25,871
Uh, you'd best stop in
and see laurat.

1321
01:03:25,871 --> 01:03:27,355
Uh, wait a minute.

1322
01:03:27,355 --> 01:03:29,046
Did you say mad-rat?

1323
01:03:29,046 --> 01:03:30,220
Isabella, wait!

1324
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:32,049
That mad-rat is,
well...

1325
01:03:32,049 --> 01:03:33,257
Well, mad!

1326
01:03:33,257 --> 01:03:36,536
Who let this disgusting
sewer rat in here?

1327
01:03:36,536 --> 01:03:38,055
Go on, get out!

1328
01:03:38,055 --> 01:03:40,057
Climb back into the gutter
you came from!

1329
01:03:40,057 --> 01:03:42,059
But, laurat,
it's me...

1330
01:03:42,059 --> 01:03:43,129
Isabella.

1331
01:03:43,129 --> 01:03:45,062
Isabella?
Mm-hmm.

1332
01:03:45,062 --> 01:03:47,513
My Bella does not
go into the sewers.

1333
01:03:47,513 --> 01:03:48,894
If she does...

1334
01:03:48,894 --> 01:03:51,241
If she does, what then?

1335
01:03:51,241 --> 01:03:55,314
She'll never
become a ladida.

1336
01:03:55,314 --> 01:03:56,384
[Mumbles]

1337
01:03:56,384 --> 01:03:59,042
I'm proud I've been
in the sewers.

1338
01:03:59,042 --> 01:04:01,423
No amount of sewer muck
could disgust me

1339
01:04:01,423 --> 01:04:03,253
as much as you do
right now!

1340
01:04:03,253 --> 01:04:05,496
It's over between US,
laurat ladida.

1341
01:04:05,496 --> 01:04:08,120
You aren't even half
the rat monty is.

1342
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:09,431
Mmm.
Huh?

1343
01:04:09,431 --> 01:04:11,123
Come on, sun.

1344
01:04:11,123 --> 01:04:13,125
Shine.

1345
01:04:13,125 --> 01:04:14,126
[Groans]

1346
01:04:14,126 --> 01:04:15,610
Where--where am I?

1347
01:04:15,610 --> 01:04:17,612
This can't be heaven,
can it?

1348
01:04:17,612 --> 01:04:19,579
Once you warm up,
you'll feel better,

1349
01:04:19,579 --> 01:04:20,580
uncle monty.

1350
01:04:20,580 --> 01:04:21,616
Monty?

1351
01:04:21,616 --> 01:04:23,756
You're also named monty,
aren't you?

1352
01:04:23,756 --> 01:04:25,758
You're
George mad-rat's son.

1353
01:04:25,758 --> 01:04:27,104
Uh-huh.

1354
01:04:27,104 --> 01:04:29,589
Then why were you
so ashamed of your uncle

1355
01:04:29,589 --> 01:04:31,074
the other day?

1356
01:04:33,110 --> 01:04:34,594
Ooh.

1357
01:04:34,594 --> 01:04:36,596
Oh, I'm so cold.

1358
01:04:38,426 --> 01:04:39,945
Ooh.

1359
01:04:39,945 --> 01:04:41,429
Uncle...

1360
01:04:41,429 --> 01:04:43,120
Can you forgive me?

1361
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:45,122
It's just that you...

1362
01:04:45,122 --> 01:04:46,123
That I...

1363
01:04:46,123 --> 01:04:47,642
All the other rats,

1364
01:04:47,642 --> 01:04:49,747
they seem to make fun
of you, and...

1365
01:04:49,747 --> 01:04:52,095
And they
make fun of you, too.

1366
01:04:52,095 --> 01:04:55,615
And you think
that's my fault?

1367
01:04:55,615 --> 01:04:58,584
Most rats
are just like humans.

1368
01:04:58,584 --> 01:05:00,655
Some good.

1369
01:05:00,655 --> 01:05:02,174
Some bad.

1370
01:05:02,174 --> 01:05:05,660
Most just hope
to make the best of life.

1371
01:05:05,660 --> 01:05:07,144
[Coughing]

1372
01:05:08,697 --> 01:05:11,183
But we need the humans
to survive.

1373
01:05:11,183 --> 01:05:12,667
True.

1374
01:05:12,667 --> 01:05:14,703
As much as they need US.

1375
01:05:14,703 --> 01:05:17,189
As much as all
the creatures on earth

1376
01:05:17,189 --> 01:05:18,673
need each other.

1377
01:05:22,504 --> 01:05:24,506
But we rats must learn

1378
01:05:24,506 --> 01:05:26,646
to think and act
for ourselves,

1379
01:05:26,646 --> 01:05:28,683
not just
be pushed around.

1380
01:05:28,683 --> 01:05:31,513
That's why the others
don't like me.

1381
01:05:31,513 --> 01:05:33,653
I don't just go
with the flow

1382
01:05:33,653 --> 01:05:35,172
like they do.

1383
01:05:35,172 --> 01:05:36,173
Uncle.

1384
01:05:36,173 --> 01:05:37,657
Yes, my boy?

1385
01:05:37,657 --> 01:05:39,176
I'm really sorry

1386
01:05:39,176 --> 01:05:41,178
about acting like
I didn't know you.

1387
01:05:41,178 --> 01:05:43,663
I had just come from
the grand rat chat,

1388
01:05:43,663 --> 01:05:45,182
and, well, I guess

1389
01:05:45,182 --> 01:05:47,184
I was just too much
of a coward.

1390
01:05:47,184 --> 01:05:48,565
You're no coward.

1391
01:05:48,565 --> 01:05:50,187
You were very brave.

1392
01:05:50,187 --> 01:05:53,294
You saved me from
that air conditioner.

1393
01:05:54,329 --> 01:05:55,813
Now, tell me,

1394
01:05:55,813 --> 01:05:58,506
where did you get
those shells?

1395
01:05:58,506 --> 01:05:59,990
From aunt Charlotte.

1396
01:05:59,990 --> 01:06:02,234
She told me she got them
from an old Indian

1397
01:06:02,234 --> 01:06:04,236
near some aztec ruins
down in Mexico.

1398
01:06:04,236 --> 01:06:05,720
Ah, Charlotte--

1399
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:07,239
still on the go.

1400
01:06:07,239 --> 01:06:08,757
[Chuckles]

1401
01:06:08,757 --> 01:06:11,726
Oh, what an old fool
I've been.

1402
01:06:12,727 --> 01:06:14,729
That business
at the gallery

1403
01:06:14,729 --> 01:06:16,248
was a bad idea.

1404
01:06:16,248 --> 01:06:20,252
But nowi know
what's behind all this.

1405
01:06:20,252 --> 01:06:21,770
I should have realized

1406
01:06:21,770 --> 01:06:24,221
those shells
have powerful energy.

1407
01:06:24,221 --> 01:06:25,705
You see, monty,

1408
01:06:25,705 --> 01:06:28,225
the shells are magical.

1409
01:06:28,225 --> 01:06:31,228
They should never
have come to Manhattan.

1410
01:06:31,228 --> 01:06:35,232
No, they should have gone
to manahateen.

1411
01:06:35,232 --> 01:06:36,406
Where?

1412
01:06:36,406 --> 01:06:38,408
What's manahateen?

1413
01:06:38,408 --> 01:06:40,237
Legend has it

1414
01:06:40,237 --> 01:06:44,241
that manahateen
is a mystical place

1415
01:06:44,241 --> 01:06:46,243
where all things
coexist

1416
01:06:46,243 --> 01:06:49,246
in true peace
and Harmony.

1417
01:06:49,246 --> 01:06:50,730
Healing plants...

1418
01:06:50,730 --> 01:06:52,249
Like aloe ve-rat...

1419
01:06:52,249 --> 01:06:54,251
Grow easily
in its rich soil.

1420
01:06:54,251 --> 01:06:55,908
All of nature,

1421
01:06:55,908 --> 01:06:58,221
the creatures, plants,
and the earth

1422
01:06:58,221 --> 01:07:01,293
grow together
in manahateen.

1423
01:07:01,293 --> 01:07:03,605
It's that way for US,
too.

1424
01:07:03,605 --> 01:07:05,124
Nature has made it

1425
01:07:05,124 --> 01:07:08,610
so we must depend
upon one another to survive.

1426
01:07:08,610 --> 01:07:09,818
You see,

1427
01:07:09,818 --> 01:07:12,442
the manahateen philosophy
is simple.

1428
01:07:12,442 --> 01:07:15,307
He who accepts nature

1429
01:07:15,307 --> 01:07:17,378
is accepted by nature.

1430
01:07:17,378 --> 01:07:18,482
[Coughs]

1431
01:07:18,482 --> 01:07:20,967
But, uh, what can
I do about it?

1432
01:07:20,967 --> 01:07:21,968
Monty,

1433
01:07:21,968 --> 01:07:25,006
each life is as important
as the rest.

1434
01:07:25,006 --> 01:07:28,975
Each and every life
is precious and valuable.

1435
01:07:28,975 --> 01:07:32,945
You must help to protect
and preserve life.

1436
01:07:32,945 --> 01:07:34,429
[Coughing]

1437
01:07:41,954 --> 01:07:43,956
I haven't much time left.

1438
01:07:43,956 --> 01:07:45,958
[Coughing]

1439
01:07:45,958 --> 01:07:47,960
But you, monty,

1440
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:49,789
you must carry on.

1441
01:07:49,789 --> 01:07:50,963
[Wheezing]

1442
01:07:50,963 --> 01:07:53,483
Now listen carefully
to me.

1443
01:07:53,483 --> 01:07:56,002
The human
with the silver car.

1444
01:07:56,002 --> 01:07:58,798
Uh, the one who wants
to destroy US all?

1445
01:07:58,798 --> 01:08:01,249
Yes. Dollart.

1446
01:08:02,354 --> 01:08:06,012
He must see the error
of his ways.

1447
01:08:06,012 --> 01:08:08,014
[Breathing erratically]

1448
01:08:08,014 --> 01:08:09,533
Hang on,
uncle monty.

1449
01:08:09,533 --> 01:08:11,017
You'll be fine.

1450
01:08:11,017 --> 01:08:14,020
Mad-rat, you made it out.

1451
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:15,539
Oh.

1452
01:08:15,539 --> 01:08:18,024
Oh, uh,
i--I'm sorry.

1453
01:08:18,024 --> 01:08:21,683
I'm glad we had
this chance to talk.

1454
01:08:25,549 --> 01:08:27,275
Come on,
uncle monty.

1455
01:08:27,275 --> 01:08:29,795
Please don't
leave US.

1456
01:08:31,037 --> 01:08:32,487
Rudi...

1457
01:08:32,487 --> 01:08:34,006
My friend.

1458
01:08:34,006 --> 01:08:36,008
This is horrible.

1459
01:08:36,008 --> 01:08:37,009
No.

1460
01:08:37,009 --> 01:08:38,010
No.

1461
01:08:38,010 --> 01:08:41,531
No, this, too,
it part of life.

1462
01:08:41,531 --> 01:08:44,016
Farewell,
my friends.

1463
01:08:44,016 --> 01:08:46,018
Uncle monty.

1464

[Sobbing]

1465
01:08:58,548 --> 01:09:01,309
Kid, we still need
one more twig.

1466
01:09:06,556 --> 01:09:09,317
Aha.

1467
01:09:14,564 --> 01:09:15,599
There!

1468
01:09:15,599 --> 01:09:17,429
That's plenty, kid.

1469
01:09:17,429 --> 01:09:18,602
You know,

1470
01:09:18,602 --> 01:09:20,742
your uncle thought you had
real artistic talent,

1471
01:09:20,742 --> 01:09:22,261
and to tell the truth,

1472
01:09:22,261 --> 01:09:24,263
I've seen the work
you did on those shells.

1473
01:09:24,263 --> 01:09:25,609
It's great.

1474
01:09:25,609 --> 01:09:28,094
Thanks, rudi. I guess
I'll be on my way then.

1475
01:09:28,094 --> 01:09:30,096
Wait, wait.
Where are you going?

1476
01:09:30,096 --> 01:09:31,270
To find Isabella.

1477
01:09:31,270 --> 01:09:33,099
Aw, there's as many
girl rats out there

1478
01:09:33,099 --> 01:09:34,618
as there
are sewer pipes.

1479
01:09:34,618 --> 01:09:37,311
What do you say the 2 of US
go into business together?

1480
01:09:42,247 --> 01:09:44,110
Lou.

1481
01:09:44,110 --> 01:09:46,561
Found a little something
for your office.

1482
01:09:46,561 --> 01:09:47,597
Oh?

1483
01:09:47,597 --> 01:09:49,081
They're
the latest thing.

1484
01:09:49,081 --> 01:09:50,255
Prehysteric.

1485
01:09:50,255 --> 01:09:52,084
That's nice, dear.
Yeah, right.

1486
01:09:52,084 --> 01:09:53,568
Thanks for the, uh...

1487
01:09:53,568 --> 01:09:54,949
Shells.

1488
01:09:54,949 --> 01:09:55,950
Yeah.

1489
01:09:55,950 --> 01:09:57,469
The water isn't receding.

1490
01:09:57,469 --> 01:09:59,919
I have to check
on stressvac's progress.

1491
01:10:01,127 --> 01:10:03,785
But, Lou, we'll be late
for the opera.

1492
01:10:03,785 --> 01:10:04,821
Yeah, whatever.

1493
01:10:04,821 --> 01:10:07,099
Can you just get
my bow tie from upstairs

1494
01:10:07,099 --> 01:10:09,066
while I check this out,
huh, dear?

1495
01:10:09,066 --> 01:10:11,068
I'll meet up with you
in a minute.

1496
01:10:11,068 --> 01:10:12,587
Ohh, that man.

1497
01:10:12,587 --> 01:10:14,279
Work, work, work.

1498

Isabella.

1499
01:10:29,604 --> 01:10:32,089
I've been looking
high and low for you.

1500
01:10:32,089 --> 01:10:33,608
Monty.

1501
01:10:33,608 --> 01:10:36,093
I was hoping you'd come.

1502
01:10:36,093 --> 01:10:37,612
I have bad news.

1503
01:10:37,612 --> 01:10:38,924
My uncle...

1504
01:10:38,924 --> 01:10:40,408
He didn't make it.

1505
01:10:40,408 --> 01:10:42,583
Oh, no.
He was so brave.

1506
01:10:42,583 --> 01:10:44,585
He saved US
at the gallery.

1507
01:10:44,585 --> 01:10:46,690
A real sacrifice.

1508
01:10:46,690 --> 01:10:48,451
Oh, monty,

1509
01:10:48,451 --> 01:10:49,935
I'm so sorry.

1510
01:10:51,454 --> 01:10:53,801
I'm going to carry out
his final wish.

1511
01:10:53,801 --> 01:10:55,458
Come with me
to see dollart.

1512
01:10:55,458 --> 01:10:57,183
Look, I've got
one of my shells back.

1513
01:10:57,183 --> 01:10:58,978
We still have a chance
to rescue everyone.

1514
01:10:58,978 --> 01:11:01,118
Now you're talking.
I'm in.

1515
01:11:01,118 --> 01:11:02,534
Isabella.

1516
01:11:02,534 --> 01:11:03,673
Yes, monty?

1517
01:11:03,673 --> 01:11:06,020
I, uh...

1518
01:11:06,020 --> 01:11:08,022
This ring
is for you.

1519
01:11:09,541 --> 01:11:11,853
Ohh, monty,
it's gorgeous.

[Smooching]

1521
01:11:29,077 --> 01:11:31,114
Well, at least
that wall's up.

1522
01:11:33,358 --> 01:11:36,671
Now, if we can only get rid
of all those rats.

1523
01:11:36,671 --> 01:11:38,190
Dollart's
poison truck.

1524
01:11:44,472 --> 01:11:46,198
All right. Ok.

1525
01:11:50,167 --> 01:11:51,997
Aah!

1526
01:11:51,997 --> 01:11:53,550
[Coughing]

1527
01:12:15,572 --> 01:12:17,056
Ohh.

1528
01:12:17,056 --> 01:12:18,057
Ah.

1529
01:12:23,062 --> 01:12:24,063
Look.

1530
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:26,169
The biggest snake of all

1531

undone by his own spray.

1532
01:12:28,067 --> 01:12:29,137
[Groans]

1533
01:12:32,244 --> 01:12:34,073
Monty,
break your shell, too.

1534
01:12:34,073 --> 01:12:35,074
What?

1535
01:12:35,074 --> 01:12:36,593
Just trust me.
You'll see.

1536
01:12:36,593 --> 01:12:37,594
It's important.

1537
01:12:37,594 --> 01:12:38,561
Ok.

1538
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:42,496
Wow!

1539
01:12:58,408 --> 01:13:00,652
Oh, Isabella!

1540
01:13:00,652 --> 01:13:02,792
That's amazing.

1541
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:11,145
Uncle monty
wasright.

1542
01:13:11,145 --> 01:13:12,836
The shells...

1543
01:13:12,836 --> 01:13:15,252
They are
magical!

1544

[Groans]

1545
01:13:18,670 --> 01:13:20,188
How can we use them

1546
01:13:20,188 --> 01:13:21,811
to find more
of the aloe ve-rat?

1547
01:13:21,811 --> 01:13:23,157
Let's ask Jean-Paul.

1548
01:13:23,157 --> 01:13:24,641
Jean-Paul!

1549
01:13:24,641 --> 01:13:28,162
Finally, there's some
action down here.

1550
01:13:28,162 --> 01:13:30,129
Why do you always
leave Jean-Paul

1551
01:13:30,129 --> 01:13:32,166
alone for so long?

1552
01:13:32,166 --> 01:13:35,307
Talking to myself
gets so boring.

1553
01:13:37,136 --> 01:13:38,137
Hi, Jean-Paul.

1554
01:13:38,137 --> 01:13:39,656
We have to hurry!

1555
01:13:39,656 --> 01:13:40,657
Hello, cherat.

1556
01:13:40,657 --> 01:13:42,521
Now he's in a hurry,
too.

1557
01:13:42,521 --> 01:13:45,144
Petit,your impatience
must be contagious.

1558
01:13:45,144 --> 01:13:46,663
Have no fear,

1559
01:13:46,663 --> 01:13:48,147
Jean-Paul is here.

1560
01:13:48,147 --> 01:13:49,666
Hop on, mes amis.

1561
01:13:49,666 --> 01:13:51,116
Jump.

1562
01:13:51,116 --> 01:13:52,289
Whoo!

1563
01:13:54,844 --> 01:13:55,879
Jean-Paul,

1564
01:13:55,879 --> 01:13:57,881
have you ever heard
of manahateen?

1565
01:13:57,881 --> 01:14:00,194
I wouldn't be much
of a canalligator

1566
01:14:00,194 --> 01:14:01,713
if I hadn't.

1567
01:14:01,713 --> 01:14:03,197
So why didn't
you tell me?

1568
01:14:03,197 --> 01:14:04,716
Jean-Paul wasn't asked,

1569
01:14:04,716 --> 01:14:06,200
so Jean-Paul
never answered.

1570
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:07,546
Simple, huh?

1571
01:14:07,546 --> 01:14:09,514
Here we go. Hang on!

1572
01:14:10,722 --> 01:14:12,724
This'll be fun.

1573
01:14:12,724 --> 01:14:15,036
Come on, Jean-Paul.
We've gotta go.

1574
01:14:15,036 --> 01:14:17,211
So many places to go.

1575
01:14:17,211 --> 01:14:20,559
Rats to see,
sewers to save.

1576
01:14:28,533 --> 01:14:30,707
Do you really know
where you're going,

1577
01:14:30,707 --> 01:14:33,917
or are you aimlessly
wandering around?

1578
01:14:33,917 --> 01:14:37,024
Jean-Paul,
do you know the way or not?

1579
01:14:38,888 --> 01:14:40,890
How can
I wander aimlessly

1580
01:14:40,890 --> 01:14:43,340
when I'm always
where I'm supposed to be?

1581
01:14:43,340 --> 01:14:45,204
Do canalligators know
when to stop talking?

1582
01:14:45,204 --> 01:14:47,379
I heard that!

1583
01:14:59,943 --> 01:15:03,084
Monty, I think we
must be getting close.

1584
01:15:04,845 --> 01:15:06,812
"End...

1585

1588
01:15:13,267 --> 01:15:14,510
At least
the signposts

1589
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:16,477
have been
kept up-to-date.

1590
01:15:16,477 --> 01:15:17,478
Jean-Paul.

1591
01:15:17,478 --> 01:15:18,790
Yes?

1592
01:15:18,790 --> 01:15:20,101
How soon?

1593
01:15:20,101 --> 01:15:22,241
We'll never get
there at this rate.

1594
01:15:36,739 --> 01:15:39,949
Monty: Look, up on the wall.

1595
01:15:39,949 --> 01:15:43,435
Our shells form the same
patterns as those imprints.

1596
01:15:43,435 --> 01:15:44,436
[Isabella gasps]

1597
01:16:07,977 --> 01:16:09,495
Ohh.

1598
01:16:10,911 --> 01:16:12,809
Wow!

01:16:16,813 --> 01:16:18,815

Truly beautiful.

1601
01:16:41,113 --> 01:16:44,047
But I don't see any
aloe ve-rat plants anywhere.

1602
01:16:44,047 --> 01:16:45,808
The flood level
is still too high.

1603
01:16:45,808 --> 01:16:48,396
Look! Below the water!

1604
01:16:51,710 --> 01:16:54,748
There's enough
aloe ve-rat down there

to last US
a hundred years,

1606
01:16:57,371 --> 01:16:59,994
but how will we get it
up from the bottom?
