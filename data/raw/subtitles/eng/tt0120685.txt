1
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,547
I'm singing in the rain

2
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:43,593
Just singing in the rain

3
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,680
What a glorious feeling

4
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:49,974
I'm happy again

5
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,518
Whoa!

6
00:05:57,816 --> 00:06:00,819
Let the stormy clouds chase

7
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:04,447
Everyone from the place

8
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:17,293
I'm laughing at clouds

9
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:22,090
So dark up above

10
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:26,720
The sun's in my eyes

11
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:30,473
And I'm ready for love

12
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:44,571
Come on. bring on that rain

13
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,744
I'm happy again

14
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:57,959
Come on with the rain
There's a smile on my face

15
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,796
I'm dancing with worms

16
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,142
Whoa!

17
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,781
A permit? Damn! How do you say "permit"?
I have a permit.

18
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:31,785
- Dr- Niko Tapopopolis?
- It's Tatopoulos.

19
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:35,121
Kyle Terrington.
I'm with the U.S. State Department.

20
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:40,168
- What are they doing?
- You're being reassigned.

21
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,879
My work here isn't finished.

22
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,673
It is now.

23
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,298
What did you see, old man?

24
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,118
That's affirmative.

25
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,831
Hey, where you going
with my stuff?

26
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,042
Hello?

27
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,296
Hello. That's very delicate.

28
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,215
Thank you.

29
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,716
Dr. Niko Topodopeles?

30
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,427
_ It's Tatopoulos.
- Whatever-

31
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,763
Get these people off the pier.

32
00:09:57,806 --> 00:10:01,893
- Sir, what am I doing here?
- Watch your step and don't talk.

33
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:05,230
Get them off the damn pier!

34
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,111
- Is this some kind of spill?
- Something like that.

35
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:13,947
I work for the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission...

36
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,408
but accidents and spills
are not my field.

37
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,201
We know.

38
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,705
Do you know you've interrupted a study
of the Chernobyl earthworm?

39
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,873
Yeah, you're the worm guy, right?

40
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:29,045
Radioactive contamination in that area
has mutated the earthworm's DNA.

41
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:32,424
- You know what that means?
- No, but I'm about to find out.

42
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,135
It means that because
of a man-made accident...

43
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:39,431
Chernobyl earthworms are now
17% larger than they were before.

44
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,891
17%, huh?
Sounds pretty big.

45
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,977
They're enormous.
That's what I'm trying to say.

46
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:48,356
I'm a biologist. I take
radioactive samples and I study them.

47
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,442
That's great.
Here's your sample.

48
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,485
- Study it-
- What sample?

49
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,699
- You're standing in it.
- I don't see it.

50
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:03,329
Where is it?

51
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:05,373
I don't see it.

52
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,053
Colonel! Colonel!

53
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:22,766
That was a footprint!
I was standing inside of a footprint.

54
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,726
That's right.

55
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:30,482
There's no animal in the world that
makes footprints like that, is there?

56
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:34,361
I told them this is not your field,
but they never listen to genius.

57
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:37,322
Nick, this is Elsie Chapman of
the National institute of Paleontology.

58
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,240
She's your boss.

59
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:42,535
- Those were footprints, right?
- Yes, they were.

60
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:47,874
- Anybody see what made them?
- Actually, no such luck.

61
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,753
It happened so fast, nobody knew
what hit them until it was over.

62
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:54,297
- Elsie?
- Yeah?

63
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:57,550
Tape's in.
The French finally released it.

64
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:03,932
This is a Japanese cannery ship that was
attacked and sunk near French Polynesia.

65
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:08,269
We believe it's connected.
Dr. Craven, have you met the "worm guy"?

66
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,232
Oh, sorry. Summer cold.

67
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:51,187
Come on, come on ! All right?

68
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,481
Have a nice day.

69
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:59,904
Oh, wait, wait, wait!

70
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:08,371
- It's supposed to rain all week.
- What's with the bags?

71
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:10,165
Caiman's groceries.

72
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,542
Oh, girl!

73
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:17,589
- Speak of the devil.
- What?

74
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:20,884
This is the midget version. This makes
me look like a trained professional.

75
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,178
Can we put this on the 5:00, please?

76
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:25,263
_ Think I should ask him?
- No!

77
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:27,557
- I'm gonna ask him.
- No!

78
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,894
- I will.
- Audrey.

79
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,940
- Did you talk with Humphries?
- This is not the place.

80
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:39,527
_ Tell me. Did you talk with him?
- He's considering you and Rodriguez.

81
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:44,616
You serious? He's gonna consider me
for the job? What else did he say?

82
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:48,703
Why don't we talk about it
over dinner tonight? Your place.

83
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:51,081
You're married.

84
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,625
Yes, and you're beautiful.
Have I told you before?

85
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:55,126
Mr. Caiman !

86
00:13:56,961 --> 00:14:00,715
I've been doing research for you after
hours and weekends for over three years.

87
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:04,010
This is a very important job to me.

88
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:08,223
I'm too old to be your assistant. I need
to know this job is going someplace.

89
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:11,226
So, have dinner with me tonight.

90
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:13,728
I can't.

91
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,648
It's your choice.

92
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:19,192
- Okay, let's go.
- Charlie?

93
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:22,654
Say hello to your new co-anchor,
Ms. Disiree Pon.

94
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:24,364
Welcome aboard.

95
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,577
- Mark, can I have a pillow, something?
- In five. Four.

96
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:31,996
Three. Two.

97
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:36,167
Hello, New York. At 5:00 we'll ask
Fat Pat, "When will this rain end?"

98
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:45,677
So three years digging up worms
in Chernobyl?

99
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,847
How did Mrs. Tata-polis
handle that?

100
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,474
It's Tatopoulos.
I'm not married.

101
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:54,394
Really? A girlfriend?

102
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:58,106
No. Perhaps I work too much.

103
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:03,528
There's no one who holds
a special place in your heart?

104
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:08,658
No. Not for a long time now.

105
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:11,327
You may be the wrong man for the job...

106
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,705
but I think you're cute.

107
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:17,751
Oh. Thank you.

108
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:24,507
She thinks I'm cute.

109
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,274
Who are they?

110
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,443
Get those people out of there.

111
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:28,196
- They're with me.
- Is that right?

112
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:32,617
- Who are you?
- Casualty and Property insurance.

113
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:35,662
- We're preparing our report.
- You're damn fast.

114
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:37,455
That's our job.

115
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:40,583
Your people are getting in the way
of my job.

116
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,712
What could've done this?

117
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,091
Mr. Roache, get your people
out of here...

118
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,093
or I will.

119
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:33,595
- Captain's getting a cup of coffee.
- Don't take too long.

120
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:37,098
- Then he'll come and kick your ass.
- Yeah ! I'm in for a buck.

121
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:52,781
What is that dope-head doing?

122
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,829
Artie!

123
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:04,167
- Artie, why are we slowing down?
- I don't know. She's at full throttle.

124
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,045
Maybe she's heavy in the net.

125
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:24,062
Yo! How come we stopped?
Are the nets full?

126
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:27,899
I don't think so.
We must be caught on something.

127
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:31,319
Bring in the nets.
Pull 'em in now.

128
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:34,864
- What's going on?
- We're bringing them in !

129
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,409
The engines are heating.

130
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:40,620
- Should I shut them down?
- No! Keep pulling!

131
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:44,624
Come on! Bring 'em!

132
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,334
I'm trying. I'm trying!

133
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:51,589
Cut 'em loose! Cut the net!

134
00:18:58,263 --> 00:18:59,514
Look out!

135
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:09,691
Cut loose now!

136
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:11,192
Hurry! Hurry!

137
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:13,403
Jump!

138
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:14,946
Abandon ship!

139
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:18,074
Let her go!

140
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,074
You hear that?

141
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,231
Excuse me, sir. Got a report
of three fishing trawlers going down.

142
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:36,486
- What makes you think it's related?
- The trawlers were pulled under, sir.

143
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:43,535
Jesus Christ!

144
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:47,622
It's 200 miles oft the Eastern American
seaboard and we don't know what it is.

145
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:50,208
- It's Theropoda Allosarus.
- What?

146
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,294
Some type of enormous reptile we believe
died out in the Cretaceous Period.

147
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:56,673
Where's it been hiding
the last 60 million years?

148
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,800
What about the traces of radiation?

149
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:03,972
The radiation isn't an anomaly.
It's the clue.

150
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:07,350
This animal is much too big
to be some kind of lost dinosaur.

151
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:10,061
Don't tell me what it isn't,
tell me what it is.

152
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:12,564
What do we know?

153
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:16,359
It was first sighted...

154
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:19,446
off the French Polynesian Pacific,
right?

155
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:23,491
That area has been exposed to dozens
of nuclear tests over the past 30 years.

156
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:25,201
Hence the radiation.

157
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:30,248
No, more than that.
I believe this is a mutated aberration.

158
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:33,335
A hybrid caused by the fallout
on these islands.

159
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:35,337
Like your earthworms?

160
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:38,840
Yes. Yes.

161
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:42,302
We're looking at a completely
incipient creature.

162
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:45,013
The dawn of a new species.

163
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:47,307
The first of its kind.

164
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:06,201
My life sucks.

165
00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:09,454
Oh, please! Your life doesn't suck.

166
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:11,873
- His life sucks.
- 'Cause I'm married to you.

167
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:16,086
I cannot believe he put the moves on me
after everything I've done for him.

168
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:21,132
He is scum! As tar as he's concerned,
you're a pair of breasts that talk.

169
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:23,051
Hey, there's an image.

170
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:25,095
He is dirt!

171
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:28,098
He's a douche bag, gutter slime,
dog crap, puke chunks.

172
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:30,100
You don't see I'm eating?

173
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:34,020
Audrey, you're too damn nice.

174
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:38,358
That's your problem.
Nice gets you nothing in this town.

175
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:42,195
It's dog eat dog. You gotta be a killer
to get ahead. Know what I'm saying?

176
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:46,282
I'm sorry, baby,
but you just don't got what it takes.

177
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:50,495
- Do you think that's true, Animal?
- Pretty much.

178
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:54,749
You're a nice person.
Nice guys finish last.

179
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:59,170
- I can be tough if I want.
- Yeah, sure.

180
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:00,880
I can!

181
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:03,758
- I can.
- No, yeah.

182
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:06,094
Whatever.

183
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:10,056
Oh, my God!

184
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:13,518
Could you turn that up, please?

185
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:22,068
- It's Nick!
- Who is he?

186
00:23:22,152 --> 00:23:24,154
He was my college sweetie.

187
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:26,322
He looks so handsome on TV.

188
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:29,993
There seems to be an unusually
tight security around the crash site-..

189
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:35,206
possibly because of the highly sensitive
military cargo on the plane-

190
00:23:45,884 --> 00:23:49,596
Fellas, you want to unload this, please?
I'm getting soaked!

191
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,598
Come on, will ya?

192
00:23:57,645 --> 00:24:00,940
Joe, gonna catch one of them
little fish in the East River?

193
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:03,360
I hope so.

194
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:05,028
You never know.

195
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:08,281
I mean, today could be my lucky day.

196
00:24:08,365 --> 00:24:10,784
The only thing you're gonna catch
is a cold!

197
00:24:26,883 --> 00:24:29,636
I got a bite!

198
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:35,016
Boy, do I have a bite!

199
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,898
Hold on, Joe. You got a big one, baby.
Hold on to it now.

200
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,942
You wanna fight?

201
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,003
Here he is, ladies and gentlemen,
the man you've all been waiting for.

202
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:29,047
Yours for a safer New York.

203
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:31,424
Your mayor, Mayor Ebert!

204
00:26:32,926 --> 00:26:34,219
Thank you!

205
00:26:36,054 --> 00:26:40,141
I want to thank all of you for coming
on this beautiful New York City day!

206
00:26:42,227 --> 00:26:44,562
When I first came into office
four years ago...

207
00:26:44,604 --> 00:26:46,856
people didn't think
that I would reduce crime.

208
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,525
But I did!

209
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:10,422
Oh, my God!

210
00:27:28,148 --> 00:27:30,275
Move it! Let's get out of here!

211
00:27:41,244 --> 00:27:43,872
I am grateful
we're getting a new set.

212
00:27:43,955 --> 00:27:46,166
It represents a commitment
on the part management.

213
00:27:46,249 --> 00:27:49,669
What I don't understand
is why we're the only station...

214
00:27:49,753 --> 00:27:53,048
that doesn't have
the Korean grocery holdup as our lead.

215
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:55,717
What's our lead?
Rain ! Again!

216
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,218
Mom?

217
00:28:00,347 --> 00:28:03,350
Sorry. I don't give a rat's ass
about a war...

218
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:05,894
in some country whose name
I can't even pronounce!

219
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,356
How about a real story?

220
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:14,194
Sir, I think your story
just walked by the window.

221
00:28:17,655 --> 00:28:19,324
What?

222
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,411
Maybe we can get in
the Korean grocer's hospital room.

223
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:26,164
Did this Romeo have a name?

224
00:28:26,247 --> 00:28:27,832
Nick Tatopoulos.

225
00:28:27,874 --> 00:28:31,086
- Jesus! Is that why you dumped him?
- No.

226
00:28:31,169 --> 00:28:34,172
How long did you guys go out, anyway?

227
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:35,799
Nearly tour years.

228
00:28:35,882 --> 00:28:39,344
Girl, I'm surprised
he didn't ask you to marry him.

229
00:28:39,427 --> 00:28:41,596
That's the problem.

230
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,890
He did.

231
00:28:43,973 --> 00:28:47,602
Tell me that's not another parade.

232
00:28:47,686 --> 00:28:50,855
I don't think that's a parade.

233
00:28:53,692 --> 00:28:55,652
Please stand by-

234
00:28:55,735 --> 00:28:58,071
What the hell is that?

235
00:29:09,624 --> 00:29:12,502
Are you all right?
Are you cut?

236
00:29:15,005 --> 00:29:16,423
Victor!

237
00:29:16,506 --> 00:29:19,676
- Don't be stupid!
- Oh, my!

238
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:21,678
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

239
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:24,681
That is really--
That is large.

240
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:28,601
Oh, my God!

241
00:29:32,731 --> 00:29:34,774
Come on, you bastard!

242
00:29:34,858 --> 00:29:36,484
Jeez!

243
00:29:36,568 --> 00:29:39,946
Victor, get back here,
you retard!

244
00:29:48,538 --> 00:29:51,041
Somebody do something!

245
00:31:16,167 --> 00:31:17,711
Sergeant O'Neal, sir!

246
00:31:17,794 --> 00:31:19,713
Any word from the mayor's office?

247
00:31:19,796 --> 00:31:23,717
Yes, sir. They've agreed to evacuate the
city and called out the National Guard.

248
00:31:23,758 --> 00:31:26,553
Wait. Evacuate Manhattan?
That's over three million people.

249
00:31:26,594 --> 00:31:28,930
- Has that been done before?
- I don't think so.

250
00:31:29,014 --> 00:31:32,976
- Where is he now?
- We lost sight of it, sir.

251
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:35,311
You want to run that by me again?

252
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:39,024
After its initial attack...

253
00:31:39,107 --> 00:31:41,693
he disappeared.

254
00:31:42,861 --> 00:31:45,739
Secretary of Defense Burk
is on the line.

255
00:31:47,198 --> 00:31:50,535
I don't understand. How could
something so big just disappear?

256
00:31:50,577 --> 00:31:54,205
- We're not sure, but we're scanning--
- He probably returned to the river.

257
00:31:54,289 --> 00:31:57,375
I don't think so.
I mean, look at it.

258
00:31:57,417 --> 00:31:59,419
It's perfect.

259
00:31:59,502 --> 00:32:05,091
An island, water on all sides,
but like no other island in the world.

260
00:32:05,175 --> 00:32:08,553
This is a place
where he can easily hide.

261
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:11,431
He's in there someplace.

262
00:32:11,514 --> 00:32:13,266
Channel 12 caught it on tape.

263
00:32:14,225 --> 00:32:18,355
Hello. I'm Charles Caiman
in the WIDF News Center.

264
00:32:18,438 --> 00:32:20,899
Ladies and gentlemen,
we New Yorkers like to think..-

265
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:26,196
we've seen it all, but what you
will see will shock you beyond belief.

266
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:30,450
This is footage we have
that indicates.-.

267
00:32:30,533 --> 00:32:33,703
that there is a dinosaur loose
in Manhattan.

268
00:32:33,787 --> 00:32:36,581
WIDF's exclusive footage
was shot barely half an hour ago.

269
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:41,461
WIDF cameraman Victor 'Animal' Palotti
survived unharmed-

270
00:32:46,883 --> 00:32:49,302
Great stuff, Animal.
Weren't you scared?

271
00:32:49,344 --> 00:32:51,680
Yeah. Thought Lucy was gonna kill me.

272
00:32:51,763 --> 00:32:53,765
Damn right, you crazy wop!

273
00:32:53,807 --> 00:32:57,352
Okay, people, we have to be
completely relocated...

274
00:32:57,435 --> 00:32:59,938
to the New Jersey station
for the 10:00 broadcast.

275
00:32:59,979 --> 00:33:01,231
Animal!

276
00:33:01,314 --> 00:33:03,566
You're riding in the chopper
with Caiman. Let's go. Lift oft.

277
00:33:04,818 --> 00:33:06,778
You going to be all right?

278
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:09,155
Audrey's going
to spend the night with us.

279
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:11,825
Cool. A threesome. That's excellent.

280
00:33:11,908 --> 00:33:13,993
I'm a little tired--

281
00:33:14,077 --> 00:33:17,997
Dozens of people are reported killed,
thousands of others injured-

282
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:21,001
Civil defense stations
are being set up throughout Manhattan.

283
00:33:21,042 --> 00:33:23,044
In addition, city, military...

284
00:33:23,128 --> 00:33:25,588
and health officials
are setting up a command post-..

285
00:33:25,672 --> 00:33:28,216
on the Jersey shore
in anticipation of an evacuation-

286
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:30,677
My bag. My bag!

287
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,471
Mr. Caiman, wait.

288
00:33:34,389 --> 00:33:36,641
I've got a lead.

289
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:39,519
- I know a guy who's on the inside.
- Not now.

290
00:33:39,561 --> 00:33:42,105
You don't understand.
I can get us inside information.

291
00:33:42,188 --> 00:33:45,400
This is when the big boys go to work.
Okay, honey? Bag.

292
00:33:58,621 --> 00:34:01,332
This is crazy! Come on, let's go.

293
00:34:01,416 --> 00:34:03,209
Wait up.

294
00:34:08,882 --> 00:34:12,761
- Can we get a cab?
- Audrey, what are you thinking?

295
00:34:12,844 --> 00:34:14,471
Go, go!

296
00:34:27,692 --> 00:34:30,528
In what city officials are describing
as the worst act of destruction...

297
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,655
since the World Trade Center bombing...

298
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:36,034
hundreds of thousands of people
have jammed the streets-..

299
00:34:36,076 --> 00:34:39,204
in the largest evacuation
in this city's history.

300
00:34:39,245 --> 00:34:43,708
And many people, many, many people
are not happy about it-

301
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:46,628
Among those unhappy citizens
are the managers of the stores-.-

302
00:34:46,711 --> 00:34:49,297
along pricey Fifth and Madison Avenue.

303
00:34:49,381 --> 00:34:53,134
The Warner Bros- and Disney stores
have been cleared out by looters.

304
00:34:53,218 --> 00:34:55,845
And the streets are jammed-
Traffic is at a standstill.

305
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:59,808
Emergency vehicles cannot have access
to any emergency that may develop.

306
00:34:59,891 --> 00:35:03,061
And there is a slow but steady stream
out of the city...

307
00:35:03,144 --> 00:35:07,524
as if Long island or New Jersey
were any refuge in this time of crisis.

308
00:35:07,607 --> 00:35:09,984
This is great!

309
00:35:10,068 --> 00:35:12,987
If I'm wrong on this evacuation, they'll
string me up from the Liberty for ch.

310
00:35:13,071 --> 00:35:16,991
Didn't we agree that we weren't to have
any sweets until after the election?

311
00:35:18,326 --> 00:35:20,286
Back off, Gene.

312
00:35:34,718 --> 00:35:36,720
- Mr. Mayor.
- Who are they?

313
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:40,015
Building owners and business people
from the community.

314
00:35:40,098 --> 00:35:43,560
- I don't have time for this nonsense.
- Campaign contributors!

315
00:35:43,643 --> 00:35:46,604
Ladies and gentlemen,
I share your concerns.

316
00:35:46,646 --> 00:35:50,900
I want to get this city back in business
as soon as possible. Please.

317
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:57,615
La Rochelle insurance. We represent
13% of the buildings in your city.

318
00:35:57,657 --> 00:36:00,452
You can count on our emotional
and financial support.

319
00:36:00,493 --> 00:36:01,703
Thank you.

320
00:36:01,786 --> 00:36:04,164
What do you plan to do?

321
00:36:16,593 --> 00:36:18,636
- Coming through.
- Where's your I.D.?

322
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,014
- What's the matter?
- You need press I.D.

323
00:36:21,097 --> 00:36:24,100
I've got l. D.
I had a badge on my bag.

324
00:36:25,185 --> 00:36:27,145
I don't know it this is a good idea.

325
00:36:27,187 --> 00:36:29,606
What are you talking about?
You stole it.

326
00:36:29,689 --> 00:36:32,650
Finally you got a little chutzpah.
Don't wimp out on me.

327
00:36:32,692 --> 00:36:34,986
What it Caiman finds out?

328
00:36:35,028 --> 00:36:38,782
How often will you have an ex-boyfriend
on the inside of a major story?

329
00:36:38,865 --> 00:36:42,369
This is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

330
00:36:42,452 --> 00:36:45,121
It I could just stick this thing.

331
00:36:45,205 --> 00:36:47,582
You got any glue?

332
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:52,087
I'm sorry. I left my forgery kit
at the office.

333
00:37:23,076 --> 00:37:24,369
No croissant?

334
00:37:30,625 --> 00:37:32,836
Ah, you call this coffee?

335
00:37:32,919 --> 00:37:34,921
I call this America.

336
00:37:37,549 --> 00:37:40,343
I'm sorry, Mr. Mayor.
but that's where we are.

337
00:37:40,427 --> 00:37:42,345
Now hold on. Hold on.

338
00:37:42,429 --> 00:37:46,599
You're saying that in an election month
I've evacuated this city for nothing?

339
00:37:46,683 --> 00:37:50,562
Do you realize what this evacuation
will cost the people of this city?

340
00:37:50,603 --> 00:37:52,939
We have been monitoring the waters
around the island.

341
00:37:52,981 --> 00:37:57,277
- As tar as we can tell, it hasn't left.
- But you don't know for sure.

342
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,821
We have a strong reason to believe
it may be hiding...

343
00:37:59,904 --> 00:38:02,240
inside one of the buildings
within the restricted area.

344
00:38:02,282 --> 00:38:04,534
- But you don't know for sure!
- Mr. Mayor.

345
00:38:05,827 --> 00:38:09,914
We cannot give the "all clear"
until each building has been checked.

346
00:38:09,998 --> 00:38:12,083
- What is it?
- Excuse me, sir.

347
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:15,628
That may be more difficult
than we originally projected.

348
00:38:15,712 --> 00:38:17,881
Terrific! More good news.

349
00:38:19,507 --> 00:38:21,885
We've run into a problem.

350
00:38:21,968 --> 00:38:24,429
- Do you believe this?
- I don't know what's going on.

351
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:26,556
- You never know what's going on.
- Thank you.

352
00:38:36,566 --> 00:38:38,360
- Here, sir.
- Fall in.

353
00:38:38,443 --> 00:38:41,029
Let's go, people.
Fall in downstairs.

354
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:09,349
Lieutenant Anderson and his men
found this this afternoon.

355
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,148
We were checking the office building
above when we found the floor was gone.

356
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:21,820
When we discovered he could burrow
through the tunnels, we realized...

357
00:39:21,861 --> 00:39:24,364
he could be outside
the quarantine zone.

358
00:39:24,447 --> 00:39:28,743
Holy Christ!
How many tunnels lead oft the island?

359
00:39:28,827 --> 00:39:31,454
Only 14. We've checked them all.
He hasn't used any of them.

360
00:39:31,538 --> 00:39:35,208
- Have them all sealed up.
- Yes, sir.

361
00:39:36,292 --> 00:39:39,087
How? How would we do that, sir?

362
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:43,008
Fill them with cement. Brick them up.
Put land mines in them, bombs.

363
00:39:43,049 --> 00:39:46,302
I don't care! Make sure the damn thing
doesn't leave the island!

364
00:39:46,386 --> 00:39:48,179
Yes, sir.

365
00:39:54,227 --> 00:39:57,272
You know, he's not some enemy
trying to evade you.

366
00:39:57,355 --> 00:40:00,150
- He's just an animal.
- What are you suggesting?

367
00:40:01,192 --> 00:40:03,695
When I had to catch earthworms...

368
00:40:03,737 --> 00:40:07,490
the best way to get them was not
to dig them out, but to draw them out.

369
00:40:07,574 --> 00:40:11,036
All we need to do
is to find out what he needs...

370
00:40:11,077 --> 00:40:13,955
and he'll come to you.

371
00:40:32,349 --> 00:40:34,225
Where are they now?

372
00:40:34,267 --> 00:40:36,770
Delta Niner, what is convoy position?

373
00:40:36,853 --> 00:40:39,022
Command, they have
just entered the city.

374
00:40:51,201 --> 00:40:55,663
I have no radio contact with the convoy.
I'm expecting ground confirmation now.

375
00:40:55,747 --> 00:40:58,583
- Convoy ETA ten minutes, sir.
- We've got to hurry.

376
00:40:58,625 --> 00:41:01,002
Man your positions now.
Ten minutes to ETA.

377
00:41:01,086 --> 00:41:03,755
Go, go, go!
All systems go!

378
00:41:14,891 --> 00:41:16,309
Is it good?

379
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:19,604
Let's go! Come on, coming through!

380
00:41:19,688 --> 00:41:21,523
Put it down.

381
00:41:36,496 --> 00:41:38,623
You said this was French Roast!

382
00:41:44,421 --> 00:41:46,464
More cream.

383
00:42:01,229 --> 00:42:02,689
Bring 'em in!

384
00:42:02,731 --> 00:42:04,441
Bring 'em back.

385
00:42:07,193 --> 00:42:09,154
I hope this plan of yours works.

386
00:42:09,195 --> 00:42:11,489
I'm hoping that myself.

387
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:15,410
- Did you give approval for this?
- They just appropriated it.

388
00:42:15,493 --> 00:42:19,664
Twelve city dump trucks? Would you like
to tell me what's going on?

389
00:42:19,748 --> 00:42:23,335
Actually, no, I wouldn't.
And don't touch anything.

390
00:42:23,418 --> 00:42:26,379
- How's O'Neal doing?
- Everything is on schedule.

391
00:42:26,463 --> 00:42:30,300
- You sure you didn't know about this?
- No one told me anything.

392
00:42:30,383 --> 00:42:32,385
Why do I keep you around?

393
00:42:37,807 --> 00:42:39,100
Dump!

394
00:42:50,737 --> 00:42:52,530
Very clever.

395
00:42:55,241 --> 00:42:58,411
Let's pile it on
and let's get out of here.

396
00:43:02,207 --> 00:43:04,167
That's a lot of fish.

397
00:43:32,028 --> 00:43:34,155
Come on, you bastard,
it's supper time.

398
00:43:36,324 --> 00:43:39,786
Look at all that frigging fish.
Is this gonna work?

399
00:43:58,888 --> 00:44:00,807
We gotta get these manholes uncovered.

400
00:44:00,849 --> 00:44:03,226
We want him to smell the bait.

401
00:44:03,309 --> 00:44:04,728
Come on !

402
00:44:06,229 --> 00:44:08,440
Let's go! Let's go!

403
00:44:13,445 --> 00:44:14,863
Come on, guys.

404
00:44:18,116 --> 00:44:19,826
Get those lids off. Go!

405
00:44:19,909 --> 00:44:22,245
What the hell is he doing?

406
00:44:22,328 --> 00:44:23,997
Okay, this way.

407
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,999
- Come on.
- You heard him. Let's go.

408
00:44:26,082 --> 00:44:28,084
Come on! Over there!

409
00:44:29,711 --> 00:44:31,588
This one-

410
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,720
Give me the crowbar.

411
00:46:27,412 --> 00:46:30,707
Set up here.
It's your best shot.

412
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:01,988
This is 6-Alpha Charlie-
We can't stay put!

413
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:04,199
We gotta move!

414
00:48:15,603 --> 00:48:17,939
We need bigger guns.

415
00:48:18,023 --> 00:48:21,151
- We've lost communications.
- Get us back on-line.

416
00:48:21,234 --> 00:48:22,819
Fire at will !

417
00:48:22,902 --> 00:48:24,946
- Fire at will.
- Fire, tire!

418
00:49:15,705 --> 00:49:17,957
O'Neal, what the hell
is going on?

419
00:49:18,041 --> 00:49:21,878
He's gone, sir.
Echo unit in pursuit.

420
00:49:34,724 --> 00:49:36,059
Follow my lead.

421
00:49:49,406 --> 00:49:52,117
- All systems armed.
- Echo 4 armed.

422
00:49:58,373 --> 00:50:00,959
We're doing 80 knots,
and he's pulling away, sir.

423
00:50:01,042 --> 00:50:03,503
I've got him locked on.

424
00:50:03,545 --> 00:50:06,798
- Target is locked on, sir.
- Fire the damn missile.

425
00:50:06,881 --> 00:50:10,051
- Echo, fire at will-
- Fire sidewinders.

426
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,497
Damn!

427
00:50:39,539 --> 00:50:42,917
That is a negative impact.
I repeat, that is a negative impact.

428
00:50:43,001 --> 00:50:45,211
- Negative impact, sir.
- Negative impact?

429
00:50:45,295 --> 00:50:47,797
That's the goddamn Chrysler Building.

430
00:50:47,881 --> 00:50:49,716
He had it locked on.

431
00:50:49,758 --> 00:50:51,384
We had you locked on.

432
00:50:51,468 --> 00:50:54,888
The heat seekers can't lock, sir.
He's colder than the buildings.

433
00:50:57,557 --> 00:50:59,392
Freddie!

434
00:51:01,561 --> 00:51:04,647
- What?
- Let's go before we get caught.

435
00:51:04,731 --> 00:51:08,193
Jimmy, you know that bad feeling I get
when something bad is going to happen?

436
00:51:08,234 --> 00:51:10,779
- Yeah.
- I'm getting that feeling right now.

437
00:51:18,578 --> 00:51:18,620
Descend to 300 feet.
All systems armed.

438
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:22,332
Descend to 300 feet.
All systems armed.

439
00:51:22,415 --> 00:51:23,500
Target, 11 :00.

440
00:51:52,362 --> 00:51:54,197
Where'd he go?

441
00:52:02,747 --> 00:52:05,542
Echo Flight, get it together, guys.
Prepare to tire.

442
00:52:05,625 --> 00:52:07,460
Echo 4, ready-

443
00:52:07,502 --> 00:52:09,087
Echo 2, ready-

444
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:11,339
Fire!

445
00:52:29,315 --> 00:52:31,317
I think we got him.

446
00:52:44,414 --> 00:52:46,916
- We've lost Echo 1 and 2, sir.
- God!

447
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,918
Echo 4, where is target?

448
00:52:52,756 --> 00:52:55,884
Jesus! He's right on my tail, sir!

449
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:00,513
I can't shake him!

450
00:53:11,608 --> 00:53:14,277
Oh, I think I lost him.

451
00:53:20,116 --> 00:53:23,536
We've lost Echo 4, sir.

452
00:53:25,246 --> 00:53:27,332
What the hell is the matter with you?

453
00:53:27,415 --> 00:53:30,585
You've caused more damage
than that goddamn thing did!

454
00:53:30,669 --> 00:53:34,214
-Calm down. Have some candy.
-I don't want any candy! Leave me alone.

455
00:53:59,614 --> 00:54:01,866
I can't believe it.

456
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:07,997
He did all of this
and we did nothing to him.

457
00:54:08,081 --> 00:54:10,208
That's not true.

458
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:11,751
We fed him.

459
00:54:16,089 --> 00:54:20,218
Here at Command Center in New Jersey
there is no new information to report-.-

460
00:54:20,301 --> 00:54:23,805
because the military has clamped
a total media blackout...

461
00:54:23,888 --> 00:54:26,016
on whatever is going on
out here.

462
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:28,685
Officials are not saying anything
about their attempts to contain...

463
00:54:28,768 --> 00:54:31,021
or control this creature.

464
00:54:32,689 --> 00:54:36,109
Okay, the situation is under control !

465
00:54:36,151 --> 00:54:39,154
It is under control.
We have containment.

466
00:54:39,237 --> 00:54:41,823
Don't wait for me. I'm okay.

467
00:54:55,086 --> 00:54:57,213
- Can I help you, young man?
- Yes.

468
00:54:57,297 --> 00:55:00,091
Do you have any
at-home pregnancy tests?

469
00:55:00,133 --> 00:55:03,345
Especially ones that look
for gonadotrophic hormones...

470
00:55:03,428 --> 00:55:05,430
or clomiphene citrate?

471
00:55:05,472 --> 00:55:07,057
I don't know.

472
00:55:09,434 --> 00:55:11,811
This is all we've got.

473
00:55:11,853 --> 00:55:14,314
I'll take all of them.

474
00:55:14,356 --> 00:55:16,191
You must have some harem.

475
00:55:19,736 --> 00:55:22,280
Oh, my God. Is that you?
What are you doing here?

476
00:55:23,656 --> 00:55:25,909
Hi. Hello.

477
00:55:25,992 --> 00:55:28,661
- Wow. How much is that?
- ¤46.

478
00:55:28,745 --> 00:55:31,915
God, you look-- Wow!

479
00:55:31,998 --> 00:55:35,001
- How have you been?
- It's good to see you, Nick.

480
00:55:37,128 --> 00:55:39,756
- So you made it.
- What?

481
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:41,925
You're a reporter.

482
00:55:42,008 --> 00:55:45,428
That's good.
That's what you always wanted.

483
00:55:45,512 --> 00:55:47,430
I'm happy for  you.

484
00:55:47,514 --> 00:55:49,516
Really. I am.

485
00:55:50,475 --> 00:55:52,602
Thank you.

486
00:56:02,487 --> 00:56:04,572
You're still mad at me?

487
00:56:04,656 --> 00:56:09,285
Well, you left without a phone call,
letter, nothing, all this time.

488
00:56:09,369 --> 00:56:13,289
Yeah. I guess I am
still a little mad.

489
00:56:14,666 --> 00:56:18,253
That was eight years ago.
Some people change.

490
00:56:18,336 --> 00:56:20,505
Most people don't.

491
00:56:23,675 --> 00:56:27,053
I'm sorry you feel that way.

492
00:56:35,562 --> 00:56:39,399
You're right.
Eight years is a long time.

493
00:56:39,482 --> 00:56:41,401
Can I make you a cup of tea?

494
00:56:44,237 --> 00:56:47,449
Sure. That'd be nice.

495
00:56:47,532 --> 00:56:49,826
I still can't believe it.

496
00:56:49,909 --> 00:56:52,746
How does a guy go
from anti-nuke activist...

497
00:56:52,787 --> 00:56:56,374
to working for
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission?

498
00:56:56,416 --> 00:57:00,337
When you and I went
to rallies together in college...

499
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:02,589
we helped to create awareness.

500
00:57:02,672 --> 00:57:05,383
But now, from the inside...

501
00:57:05,467 --> 00:57:07,469
I'm able to effect real change.

502
00:57:07,552 --> 00:57:10,930
And exactly what changes
are you trying to effect?

503
00:57:11,014 --> 00:57:13,767
I'm preparing a census
for the government.

504
00:57:13,850 --> 00:57:18,897
I'm cataloging new species created
as a result of nuclear contamination.

505
00:57:20,231 --> 00:57:24,944
- Is that what you think created this?
- Yeah. I found a blood sample earlier.

506
00:57:25,028 --> 00:57:29,866
- How close did you get to the thing?
- I got pretty close.

507
00:57:31,576 --> 00:57:34,245
What else did you find out?

508
00:57:34,329 --> 00:57:36,373
We know he eats tons of fish.

509
00:57:36,456 --> 00:57:38,833
He's amphibious.
He's a burrower.

510
00:57:39,709 --> 00:57:41,211
And...

511
00:57:47,509 --> 00:57:49,386
he's pregnant.

512
00:57:51,930 --> 00:57:53,306
He is?

513
00:57:53,348 --> 00:57:56,309
He! A very unusual he.

514
00:57:57,185 --> 00:58:01,106
Obviously these tests
weren't designed for  this..-

515
00:58:01,147 --> 00:58:05,235
but fundamentally they look for  the same
hormonal patterns to indicate pregnancy.

516
00:58:05,318 --> 00:58:09,155
I don't get it. It he's the first
of his kind, how can he be pregnant?

517
00:58:09,197 --> 00:58:11,157
Doesn't he need a mate?

518
00:58:11,199 --> 00:58:13,284
Not if he reproduces asexually.

519
00:58:14,327 --> 00:58:16,246
Where's the fun in that?

520
00:58:18,581 --> 00:58:22,502
I kept thinking,
why would he travel so tar?

521
00:58:22,585 --> 00:58:24,713
But it makes perfect sense.

522
00:58:24,796 --> 00:58:29,300
Lots of animals travel
great distances for  reproduction.

523
00:58:30,468 --> 00:58:33,471
That's what he's doing in New York.
He's nesting.

524
00:58:33,555 --> 00:58:36,057
- Nesting?
- Yes.

525
00:58:36,141 --> 00:58:38,768
Do you realize
that a lizard can lay...

526
00:58:38,852 --> 00:58:41,312
up to 12 eggs at a time?

527
00:58:41,354 --> 00:58:43,982
- Think of it.
- I didn't know that.

528
00:58:44,065 --> 00:58:47,110
Forgive me.
I have to get this to the lab...

529
00:58:47,193 --> 00:58:49,529
see it I can confirm all this.

530
00:58:50,655 --> 00:58:52,949
I'll be right back.

531
01:00:57,157 --> 01:00:59,951
Come on, Joey.
There's nothing down here.

532
01:01:00,035 --> 01:01:03,371
I'm telling you, man,
I heard something.

533
01:01:03,455 --> 01:01:06,166
You heard nothing.
It's a dead end.

534
01:01:15,925 --> 01:01:17,469
Anything?

535
01:01:19,012 --> 01:01:22,474
No. Nothing down here.

536
01:01:23,350 --> 01:01:25,435
Nothing at all.

537
01:01:34,235 --> 01:01:37,405
This is why, in this case, all the
king's horses and all the king's men.-.

538
01:01:37,489 --> 01:01:40,241
may not be able to put
the Big Apple together again.

539
01:01:40,325 --> 01:01:42,494
Audrey Timmonds. WIDF News-

540
01:01:42,535 --> 01:01:44,788
- Yes!
- That's it. You owe me a beer.

541
01:01:44,871 --> 01:01:46,998
You like it?
I should've worn my hair back.

542
01:01:47,082 --> 01:01:49,250
- No, it looks great.
- You liked it? Good.

543
01:01:49,334 --> 01:01:52,587
Can I ask you something?
How did you get a hold of this material?

544
01:01:52,671 --> 01:01:55,507
It's like you said.

545
01:01:55,548 --> 01:01:57,759
"Nice guys finish last."

546
01:01:57,842 --> 01:02:00,512
- Thank you. I love you.
- Yeah, sure.

547
01:02:07,686 --> 01:02:09,646
Murray!

548
01:02:09,729 --> 01:02:11,940
Come here a second.

549
01:02:13,233 --> 01:02:15,235
Hold on a second?
What is it?

550
01:02:15,276 --> 01:02:18,405
I've got exclusive footage
of other places this thing has attacked.

551
01:02:18,488 --> 01:02:20,532
You do?
Whose story is that?

552
01:02:20,615 --> 01:02:22,617
Mine.

553
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:49,519
If we can lure him into a more open area
such as this portion of Central Park-..

554
01:02:49,602 --> 01:02:51,521
I think we can take him down.

555
01:02:51,604 --> 01:02:54,024
Last time you didn't even scratch it.

556
01:02:54,107 --> 01:02:59,821
That's not true. Our worm guy,
I mean Dr. Tatopoulos, has found blood.

557
01:02:59,904 --> 01:03:02,282
Yes, I did.

558
01:03:02,323 --> 01:03:04,576
We need to get him out
into open terrain...

559
01:03:04,659 --> 01:03:07,912
and use weapons that don't rely
on heat-seeking technology--

560
01:03:07,996 --> 01:03:13,418
Excuse me, sir. I think this situation
has become more complicated than that.

561
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:15,503
The blood that I collected...

562
01:03:15,587 --> 01:03:20,675
revealed that the creature is either
about to lay eggs or already has.

563
01:03:20,759 --> 01:03:24,637
Are you trying to tell us that there's
another one of those things out there?

564
01:03:24,679 --> 01:03:27,140
No, Governor.
I don't believe so.

565
01:03:27,182 --> 01:03:28,892
Wait a minute.

566
01:03:28,975 --> 01:03:31,269
Then how can it be pregnant?

567
01:03:31,311 --> 01:03:33,313
What is this, the virgin lizard?

568
01:03:34,314 --> 01:03:37,567
No. It reproduces asexually.

569
01:03:37,650 --> 01:03:40,695
That's why we have to find the nest
as soon as possible.

570
01:03:40,779 --> 01:03:43,448
Otherwise up to a dozen
are going to be born...

571
01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:47,243
each one capable of laying eggs
on its own.

572
01:03:47,327 --> 01:03:50,747
Very quickly we could be looking at
an enormous population.

573
01:03:50,830 --> 01:03:53,083
After we kill the creature,
then we'll search for the nest.

574
01:03:53,166 --> 01:03:57,837
I think it might be too late by then.
These eggs will hatch very quickly.

575
01:03:57,921 --> 01:03:59,673
How do you know?

576
01:03:59,756 --> 01:04:03,802
The fish that we found
on the subway.

577
01:04:03,885 --> 01:04:07,180
He's not collecting all this food
just for  himself.

578
01:04:07,263 --> 01:04:09,557
He's preparing to teed his young.

579
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:31,705
Stay tuned for our special report.

580
01:04:32,622 --> 01:04:35,125
Would you excuse us, please?
Where you been?

581
01:04:35,208 --> 01:04:37,168
They just promo-ed your spot.
It's up right after this.

582
01:04:38,044 --> 01:04:39,462
Turn it up?

583
01:04:39,546 --> 01:04:42,590
Yo! Can you turn it up, please?
The TV!

584
01:04:42,674 --> 01:04:46,553
It Dr. Tatopoulos is right, we must act
quickly before this problem escalates.

585
01:04:46,636 --> 01:04:49,889
So you want to divide our efforts
based solely on some wild theory?

586
01:04:49,973 --> 01:04:53,184
Sir, Nick's come through for  us before.
It he feels--

587
01:04:53,226 --> 01:04:56,354
Come through for  you?
Colonel, your campaign's a disaster.

588
01:04:56,396 --> 01:04:59,190
You weren't even able to keep this thing
from coming to Manhattan.

589
01:04:59,232 --> 01:05:02,068
Excuse me, gentlemen,
but I think we should see this.

590
01:05:02,152 --> 01:05:06,865
Look at the methods and motivations
of Manhattan's newest unwanted pest.

591
01:05:11,536 --> 01:05:13,204
Godzilla.

592
01:05:13,288 --> 01:05:15,957
That's what Japanese sailors
called him in song.

593
01:05:16,041 --> 01:05:20,754
A mythological sea dragon
who filled their hearts with fear.

594
01:05:20,837 --> 01:05:22,922
- He stole my report!
- I know.

595
01:05:23,006 --> 01:05:25,216
That myth has become reality,
our modern-day terror-

596
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:27,010
I don't believe it!

597
01:05:27,093 --> 01:05:31,348
Who is this Godzilla?
Where did he come from? Why is he here?

598
01:05:31,431 --> 01:05:34,893
And it's Gojira, you moron !

599
01:05:34,976 --> 01:05:38,772
A direct path can be traced
from Manhattan to French Polynesia.-.

600
01:05:38,855 --> 01:05:41,274
where nuclear tests have been going on
for more than two decades-

601
01:05:41,316 --> 01:05:44,277
Research team member
Dr- Nick Papadopoulus believes..-.

602
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:46,654
the creature may be nesting..-

603
01:05:46,738 --> 01:05:49,240
using Manhattan as ground zero
to cultivate the species.

604
01:05:49,282 --> 01:05:51,451
This despite the fact
that the combined might...

605
01:05:51,534 --> 01:05:54,996
of the United States military
has been unable to subdue--

606
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:57,082
You went to the press with this?

607
01:05:57,165 --> 01:06:00,418
- No! I haven't talked to anyone.
- They mentioned you by name!

608
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:02,087
Yeah. Yeah !

609
01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:04,422
You gave them the tape?

610
01:06:04,464 --> 01:06:08,927
No, I didn't give them the tape.
It's in my tent right now.

611
01:06:09,010 --> 01:06:13,181
Oh, my God! She took it.

612
01:06:16,059 --> 01:06:20,480
Pack your stuff, mister. You're
officially oft this project as of now!

613
01:06:37,288 --> 01:06:38,790
We're leaving.

614
01:06:45,714 --> 01:06:47,424
I'm so sorry.

615
01:06:52,470 --> 01:06:56,433
Make sure that Hicks finds that nest
before it's too late.

616
01:06:57,517 --> 01:06:59,102
I'll try.

617
01:07:10,947 --> 01:07:14,993
He's not there? A second ago
you told me he was on the other line.

618
01:07:15,035 --> 01:07:18,830
Please. It's urgent. I really need
to talk to him. Yes, Nick Tatopoulos.

619
01:07:31,384 --> 01:07:33,219
You're leaving?

620
01:07:34,471 --> 01:07:36,473
Why?

621
01:07:36,556 --> 01:07:39,768
Is it 'cause of me?
'Cause of the story?

622
01:07:39,851 --> 01:07:42,562
What did you think
was going to happen?

623
01:07:42,645 --> 01:07:45,065
You never said it was oft the record.

624
01:07:46,441 --> 01:07:51,404
I shouldn't have to. You were supposed
to be my friend. I trusted you.

625
01:07:55,742 --> 01:07:58,578
There's something I have to tell you.

626
01:07:58,620 --> 01:08:00,914
I lied to you.

627
01:08:00,997 --> 01:08:03,541
I'm not a reporter.

628
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:11,383
When we broke up,
and I first came out to New York...

629
01:08:11,424 --> 01:08:13,760
I was so sure I'd make it.

630
01:08:13,843 --> 01:08:16,262
But I haven't.

631
01:08:16,304 --> 01:08:18,848
That's why I needed the story so bad.

632
01:08:20,016 --> 01:08:22,560
I couldn't tell you
I'm a failure-

633
01:08:29,693 --> 01:08:32,737
And you thought that made it okay
to steal my tapes?

634
01:08:32,821 --> 01:08:36,324
It was a terrible thing to do.
I never should've done that.

635
01:08:42,330 --> 01:08:44,624
Good luck with your new career.

636
01:08:44,708 --> 01:08:47,544
I really think you have
what it takes.

637
01:08:47,627 --> 01:08:49,254
Newark Airport.

638
01:08:59,431 --> 01:09:01,099
I'm sorry.

639
01:09:04,561 --> 01:09:08,273
Yo! Give her a break, will ya?

640
01:09:36,801 --> 01:09:39,971
Excuse me, is this the best way
to the airport?

641
01:09:44,809 --> 01:09:47,187
Sir, where are you going?

642
01:09:48,688 --> 01:09:50,106
Hello?

643
01:09:53,193 --> 01:09:54,861
Okay, stop.

644
01:09:54,944 --> 01:09:56,988
Stop the car right now!

645
01:09:58,114 --> 01:10:00,033
Let me out of here!

646
01:10:02,327 --> 01:10:04,829
I'm afraid I can't do that.

647
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:09,292
I know you, don't l?

648
01:10:10,752 --> 01:10:13,296
Yeah, you're that insurance guy.

649
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:17,300
Agent Philippe Roache, D.G.S. E.

650
01:10:17,384 --> 01:10:20,011
Direction Generale
des Securite Exterieure.

651
01:10:20,095 --> 01:10:21,763
Sounds big.

652
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:25,892
The French Secret Service.

653
01:10:28,895 --> 01:10:33,900
Your American friends have decided
not to look for  the creature's nest.

654
01:10:34,901 --> 01:10:37,654
What? Are you sure?
How do you know that?

655
01:10:37,737 --> 01:10:40,740
- We know. Trust me.
- Trust you?

656
01:10:40,824 --> 01:10:44,035
You hijack me and you expect me
to trust you?

657
01:10:44,119 --> 01:10:46,371
- Yes.
- Why should l?

658
01:10:46,454 --> 01:10:51,918
Because you are the only one who wants
to find the nest as much as I do.

659
01:11:19,529 --> 01:11:21,990
How did you get all this stuff
into the country?

660
01:11:22,073 --> 01:11:24,534
This is America.
We can buy anything.

661
01:11:25,618 --> 01:11:29,539
Why all the secrecy? Why aren't you
working with the U.S. military?

662
01:11:29,622 --> 01:11:33,668
I'm not permitted
to speak of such things.

663
01:11:33,752 --> 01:11:36,463
You said you needed my trust.
Then I need yours.

664
01:11:40,383 --> 01:11:43,428
I am a patriot. I love my country.
You understand that?

665
01:11:43,511 --> 01:11:44,971
Sure.

666
01:11:45,013 --> 01:11:47,265
It is my job to protect my country.

667
01:11:47,349 --> 01:11:50,310
Sometimes I must even protect it
from itself...

668
01:11:50,352 --> 01:11:52,354
from mistakes we've made.

669
01:11:52,437 --> 01:11:55,148
Mistakes we don't want the world
to know about.

670
01:11:55,231 --> 01:11:58,360
- The nuclear tests in the Pacific?
- Yes-

671
01:11:58,443 --> 01:12:02,113
This testing done by my country
left a terrible mess.

672
01:12:02,197 --> 01:12:04,324
We're here to clean it up.

673
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:21,383
We know how to get into the city.

674
01:12:21,466 --> 01:12:23,885
We just don't know where
to start looking.

675
01:12:31,226 --> 01:12:34,688
Here. This is the 23rd Street
subway station.

676
01:12:34,729 --> 01:12:37,982
That's where we first found the fish.
That'd be a good place to start.

677
01:12:38,066 --> 01:12:39,734
So you're in?

678
01:12:43,238 --> 01:12:45,824
Yeah. Yeah, I'm in.

679
01:12:49,077 --> 01:12:52,205
I always wanted to join
the French Foreign Legion.

680
01:13:03,258 --> 01:13:06,219
- Hello.
- How's it going?

681
01:13:13,059 --> 01:13:16,354
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Sorry.

682
01:13:16,438 --> 01:13:18,648
- Honey?
- Hi, sweetie.

683
01:13:19,691 --> 01:13:21,735
- Who are all these people?
- What?

684
01:13:21,818 --> 01:13:24,738
I couldn't just let them
sleep on the street.

685
01:13:28,908 --> 01:13:30,535
Where's Audrey?

686
01:13:30,618 --> 01:13:33,496
In the bedroom crying her eyes out
because of you.

687
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:34,956
What did I do?

688
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:37,834
That "you gotta be vicious" stuff
you tilled her head with.

689
01:13:37,917 --> 01:13:41,046
- Get out of here!
- Go talk to her right now.

690
01:13:41,129 --> 01:13:43,381
I was agreeing with you.
Excuse me.

691
01:13:43,465 --> 01:13:45,550
Contrary to frivolous reporting-.-

692
01:13:45,633 --> 01:13:49,971
we have absolutely no information
whatsoever to make us believe..-

693
01:13:50,055 --> 01:13:52,974
that there are any eggs of the creature
in the city.

694
01:13:53,058 --> 01:13:57,354
There's no need for panic.
Repeat. There's no reason to panic.

695
01:14:00,106 --> 01:14:02,067
It's all my fault.

696
01:14:03,234 --> 01:14:06,696
What have I done?
What have I become?

697
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:10,658
Look at me. This isn't me.
I don't do stuff like this.

698
01:14:10,742 --> 01:14:12,952
You made a mistake. It happens.

699
01:14:14,454 --> 01:14:19,751
Well, I totally screwed up with the
only man who will ever care about me.

700
01:14:19,793 --> 01:14:22,212
It I told you you could make it all up,
would you?

701
01:14:22,295 --> 01:14:23,880
Of course I would.

702
01:14:23,963 --> 01:14:25,757
So get this.

703
01:14:25,799 --> 01:14:29,928
After he left you in the street,
I kinda followed him.

704
01:14:30,011 --> 01:14:32,764
Figured I'd talk some sense
into the guy, you know?

705
01:14:32,806 --> 01:14:35,392
Next thing I know,
he pulls into this warehouse...

706
01:14:35,475 --> 01:14:38,603
with all these French wackos
in military outfits.

707
01:14:38,687 --> 01:14:41,940
They want to sneak back
into the city tonight.

708
01:14:42,023 --> 01:14:43,983
They're going after the nest.

709
01:14:44,025 --> 01:14:47,487
It he finds it, I think you should be
the one that lets the world know...

710
01:14:47,570 --> 01:14:49,489
that this guy was right all along.

711
01:14:50,615 --> 01:14:52,617
You want me to follow him
into the city?

712
01:14:52,701 --> 01:14:55,787
Yeah. We both will.

713
01:14:55,829 --> 01:14:57,831
Come on. It'll be fun.

714
01:14:57,914 --> 01:15:01,668
I don't know. I've already made
such a mess of everything.

715
01:15:01,751 --> 01:15:04,212
Yeah, you did, Audrey.
I'm goin' after him.

716
01:15:04,295 --> 01:15:07,507
You can come with me or not. Okay?

717
01:15:10,677 --> 01:15:12,804
What are you doing?

718
01:15:12,887 --> 01:15:16,057
Can't let Lucy know.
She'll hurt me.

719
01:15:34,451 --> 01:15:36,036
What's with the gum?

720
01:15:37,287 --> 01:15:39,539
Makes us look more American.

721
01:15:39,622 --> 01:15:41,666
Really?

722
01:15:44,836 --> 01:15:47,756
Just let me do the talking.
All right?

723
01:15:51,968 --> 01:15:53,928
It's not in gear.

724
01:16:03,521 --> 01:16:05,440
Follow me. This way.

725
01:16:09,652 --> 01:16:12,072
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

726
01:16:21,623 --> 01:16:24,584
- Come on.
- What is this place?

727
01:16:24,668 --> 01:16:27,879
It's a vent that leads to
the subway tunnels underneath here.

728
01:16:27,962 --> 01:16:31,174
It should take us to
the 23rd Street station in Manhattan.

729
01:16:33,718 --> 01:16:37,472
You've got to be kidding me.
Aren't there rats and stuff down here?

730
01:16:37,555 --> 01:16:40,684
I'm more concerned about lizards
at this point.

731
01:16:40,767 --> 01:16:43,687
Big, ugly, nasty, large lizards.

732
01:17:01,162 --> 01:17:02,622
Who you with?

733
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,502
We're with the 3-2, sir.

734
01:17:07,585 --> 01:17:09,838
I didn't ask you, soldier!

735
01:17:09,921 --> 01:17:12,424
Sergeant O'Neal just called down for  us.

736
01:17:12,507 --> 01:17:14,968
He wants us to join him now, sir.
Thank you.

737
01:17:17,971 --> 01:17:21,766
- You got a problem talking'?
- No, sir. I'm tine.

738
01:17:23,476 --> 01:17:24,894
Let's go!

739
01:17:26,229 --> 01:17:27,814
Keep it movin'.

740
01:17:27,897 --> 01:17:30,233
Thank you very much.

741
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:40,076
Elvis Presley movies.
He was the King.

742
01:17:45,123 --> 01:17:47,417
Sir, O'Neal on-line.

743
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:49,044
Do you read me?

744
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:53,965
Call for O'Neal!

745
01:17:54,049 --> 01:17:55,884
How are we doing?

746
01:17:55,967 --> 01:17:59,471
So tar so good.
We're right on schedule.

747
01:18:00,972 --> 01:18:02,390
We're good.

748
01:18:03,850 --> 01:18:05,310
We're good.

749
01:18:19,741 --> 01:18:22,827
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah. There they are.

750
01:18:22,911 --> 01:18:25,538
Kill your light.

751
01:18:27,624 --> 01:18:29,834
How do we get down there?
We're gonna lose them.

752
01:18:39,094 --> 01:18:42,722
- How did they get down there?
- I don't know.

753
01:18:43,848 --> 01:18:46,518
You don't think
they climbed down this thing?

754
01:18:46,559 --> 01:18:48,019
Jesus!

755
01:19:04,452 --> 01:19:06,413
Careful.

756
01:19:12,252 --> 01:19:14,212
- Gimme your hand.
- I got you.

757
01:19:17,007 --> 01:19:18,425
The gutter.

758
01:19:25,306 --> 01:19:28,852
- Do you hear that?
- What?

759
01:20:11,978 --> 01:20:13,772
Animal, come on!

760
01:20:53,186 --> 01:20:55,730
I guess we go this way.

761
01:21:14,916 --> 01:21:17,377
Sir, we spotted him in section 5.

762
01:21:19,045 --> 01:21:22,048
Combat positions! Here we go.
Combat!

763
01:21:26,678 --> 01:21:29,764
Target's heading north
to section 5.

764
01:21:29,848 --> 01:21:34,227
Do not fire until he has cleared
the buildings and enters the park.

765
01:23:00,647 --> 01:23:03,608
Wait until he enters the park.

766
01:23:18,873 --> 01:23:20,542
Come on.

767
01:23:26,297 --> 01:23:27,716
He's leaving!

768
01:23:27,799 --> 01:23:30,010
Fire away!

769
01:23:37,517 --> 01:23:38,852
Damn!

770
01:23:50,363 --> 01:23:51,990
Fire!

771
01:23:57,537 --> 01:23:58,997
Raven Flight. Evasive maneuvers.

772
01:24:06,796 --> 01:24:10,342
Target is in the clear. He's headed
toward the Westside Highway-

773
01:24:28,526 --> 01:24:31,071
Don't worry. The navy
has something waiting for him.

774
01:24:38,536 --> 01:24:42,165
- Stations manned for  battle station.
- At ordered depth, sir.

775
01:24:42,248 --> 01:24:45,126
We've got him on sonar.
Utah closing in.

776
01:24:45,210 --> 01:24:47,128
Make final preparations.
Prepare to tire.

777
01:24:55,762 --> 01:24:57,472
Manned and ready.

778
01:24:57,555 --> 01:24:59,557
Torpedo room reports
manned and ready.

779
01:24:59,599 --> 01:25:02,477
- Final bearing in chute.
- Are we locked on?

780
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:05,438
- Are we locked on?
- Aye, sir.

781
01:25:05,522 --> 01:25:08,274
- Locked on, Captain.
- Number one, stand by. Fire.

782
01:25:08,358 --> 01:25:11,277
Torpedo 1 left the tube.

783
01:25:23,331 --> 01:25:25,917
Indiana and Anchorage closing in.

784
01:25:25,959 --> 01:25:29,129
- What's the status?
- We're locked on and closing in.

785
01:25:29,212 --> 01:25:30,463
Fire one.

786
01:25:52,736 --> 01:25:55,864
- The target's heading right at us!
- All back full.

787
01:25:55,947 --> 01:25:58,700
Aye, sir. All back full.

788
01:26:05,999 --> 01:26:09,002
Stand by for impact in ten seconds.

789
01:26:13,590 --> 01:26:15,216
Six. Five.

790
01:26:16,343 --> 01:26:18,053
Four. Three.

791
01:26:18,845 --> 01:26:20,388
Two. One.

792
01:26:40,033 --> 01:26:42,494
We've lost the Anchorage. sir.

793
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:54,798
He's shitted course.
He's heading back towards Manhattan.

794
01:26:54,881 --> 01:26:56,966
Full ahead. Close in and lock on.

795
01:26:57,050 --> 01:27:00,178
Prepare tubes 3 and 4 and lock on.

796
01:27:06,976 --> 01:27:11,189
- Stand by, 3. Fire.
- Torpedo 3 left the tube.

797
01:27:17,696 --> 01:27:21,199
Impact in eight seconds.
Seven. Six.

798
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:30,291
Three. Two. One.

799
01:27:37,340 --> 01:27:39,801
- Direct hit!
- Got him.

800
01:27:40,927 --> 01:27:42,887
Congratulations, sir.

801
01:27:42,929 --> 01:27:44,389
Good job.

802
01:27:45,140 --> 01:27:46,599
Well done.

803
01:27:47,892 --> 01:27:49,310
Good job.

804
01:28:27,766 --> 01:28:29,351
What's up there?

805
01:28:52,707 --> 01:28:55,210
This is a good smell.

806
01:28:55,293 --> 01:28:56,711
Yeah.

807
01:28:58,380 --> 01:29:02,133
Look at this.
He trashed the Garden.

808
01:29:02,217 --> 01:29:05,679
Oh, man!
Now I'm pissed.

809
01:29:07,472 --> 01:29:08,890
Is that them?

810
01:29:08,973 --> 01:29:10,392
Yeah.

811
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:48,179
Three eggs.

812
01:29:48,263 --> 01:29:50,432
I thought there'd be more.

813
01:29:50,515 --> 01:29:52,517
And you were right.

814
01:30:04,446 --> 01:30:07,532
Oh my! Wow!

815
01:30:08,950 --> 01:30:11,411
There's gotta be more
than 20 eggs here.

816
01:30:12,412 --> 01:30:13,872
Way more!

817
01:30:33,641 --> 01:30:35,101
Start counting-

818
01:30:48,281 --> 01:30:51,242
- Could you help me?
- You all right?

819
01:31:28,697 --> 01:31:31,157
What the hell are they doing?

820
01:32:06,651 --> 01:32:09,112
We have a problem.

821
01:32:45,023 --> 01:32:48,068
Oh, my God! God!

822
01:32:48,151 --> 01:32:50,236
Come on, let's go.

823
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:53,948
One second, all right?
This is unbelievable.

824
01:33:07,504 --> 01:33:11,549
- Don't we have enough already?
- I just want -

825
01:33:15,970 --> 01:33:19,766
That's good for  me.
That's plenty.

826
01:33:23,019 --> 01:33:25,105
We should-- Let's--

827
01:33:32,529 --> 01:33:36,616
Let's not startle him.

828
01:33:45,291 --> 01:33:47,877
We smell like the fish.

829
01:33:47,961 --> 01:33:50,922
- I think we should leave now.
- I think that's a good idea.

830
01:34:17,449 --> 01:34:19,701
Run! Come on!

831
01:34:26,499 --> 01:34:29,794
- Everybody outside now!
- Come on, quickly!

832
01:34:45,685 --> 01:34:49,647
Lock the doors now!
We have to keep them contained inside.

833
01:34:49,689 --> 01:34:51,691
Come on, let's go!

834
01:35:52,669 --> 01:35:54,879
- You see that?
- On three.

835
01:35:55,797 --> 01:35:57,340
Three!

836
01:36:09,019 --> 01:36:11,688
This is where the Knicks
get showered and everything.

837
01:36:19,112 --> 01:36:21,740
Now what do we do?

838
01:36:23,616 --> 01:36:27,454
I'm standing just outside the
Jersey entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel...

839
01:36:27,537 --> 01:36:31,958
where thousands of angry refugees are
demanding to be let back into the city.

840
01:36:32,042 --> 01:36:37,255
All major arteries into the city
are clogged with jubilant Manhattanites.

841
01:36:37,297 --> 01:36:39,507
Yes, I understand.

842
01:36:39,591 --> 01:36:43,011
- Your office is swamped with calls.
- I know.

843
01:36:43,094 --> 01:36:46,389
Do you have any idea what's going on out
there? Phones are ringing off the hook.

844
01:36:46,473 --> 01:36:48,767
People are screaming
to be let back into the city.

845
01:36:48,808 --> 01:36:51,102
We're sending divers in
to retrieve the body.

846
01:36:51,144 --> 01:36:53,146
What are you waiting for ?

847
01:36:53,188 --> 01:36:56,816
Colonel, we've got to start a search
for the nest.

848
01:36:56,900 --> 01:36:58,860
We've been through this already.

849
01:36:58,943 --> 01:37:01,321
What it Nick is right
and we blow this whole thing?

850
01:37:01,404 --> 01:37:04,491
This could be the only chance we have
to do something about it.

851
01:37:07,577 --> 01:37:11,206
Captain, organize a search party.

852
01:37:11,289 --> 01:37:13,625
I want a sweep of the entire city
and the subway.

853
01:37:13,708 --> 01:37:16,211
You don't have the authority
to do that.

854
01:37:16,294 --> 01:37:18,755
Try and stop me.

855
01:37:30,475 --> 01:37:32,060
Contact the military.

856
01:37:32,143 --> 01:37:35,188
Get them to send a bomber
to blow up this building.

857
01:37:35,271 --> 01:37:39,651
- How do I do that?
- 555-7600.

858
01:37:39,734 --> 01:37:43,196
Tell them it's a Code Dragonfly.
That should get you through.

859
01:37:44,239 --> 01:37:46,866
What are you waiting for ?

860
01:37:46,950 --> 01:37:49,452
- 555 what?
- 7600.

861
01:37:56,292 --> 01:37:59,754
- All circuits are busy right now.
- It's busy.

862
01:37:59,838 --> 01:38:01,047
Try again!

863
01:38:11,683 --> 01:38:13,101
What did they say?

864
01:38:14,602 --> 01:38:17,355
I can't get through.
I don't know what's wrong.

865
01:38:19,774 --> 01:38:21,735
We secured the doors.

866
01:38:21,776 --> 01:38:25,613
- Where is Jean-Philippe, Jean-Pierre?
- They didn't make it.

867
01:38:29,534 --> 01:38:33,079
My men and I will hold them here.
You'll have to go and get help.

868
01:38:51,806 --> 01:38:54,517
Can we tit up there?

869
01:38:55,810 --> 01:38:58,063
Only one way to find out.

870
01:38:59,439 --> 01:39:01,608
Boost me up.

871
01:41:14,282 --> 01:41:16,326
This is not good.

872
01:41:30,382 --> 01:41:31,549
Come on.

873
01:41:36,429 --> 01:41:37,889
Come on.

874
01:42:06,668 --> 01:42:08,294
Wrong floor.

875
01:42:17,804 --> 01:42:20,015
Why don't we go this way?

876
01:42:42,078 --> 01:42:45,165
- It's me. It's me.
- What happened?

877
01:42:45,248 --> 01:42:48,293
They're loose. They're all over
the place. I couldn't get out.

878
01:42:54,174 --> 01:42:57,510
- Who are you?
- Audrey!

879
01:42:59,346 --> 01:43:00,764
Here.

880
01:43:03,850 --> 01:43:05,852
- You all right?
- I think so.

881
01:43:05,894 --> 01:43:07,979
No cameras.

882
01:43:08,063 --> 01:43:10,148
Yeah, all right.
Very good.

883
01:43:10,231 --> 01:43:14,944
Do you have a radio, walkie-talkie,
anything to contact the outside?

884
01:43:15,028 --> 01:43:18,323
- What about the phones?
- It's no good. Circuits are jammed.

885
01:43:18,406 --> 01:43:22,827
Wait. I know a way. I know how
we can get a message to the outside.

886
01:43:31,211 --> 01:43:32,712
This way.

887
01:43:35,882 --> 01:43:37,300
The tape!

888
01:43:44,974 --> 01:43:46,226
Come on !

889
01:44:00,949 --> 01:44:02,409
Come on.

890
01:44:02,492 --> 01:44:05,453
- The broadcast booth is over here.
- How do you know that?

891
01:44:05,537 --> 01:44:08,164
Our network covers the Rangers games.

892
01:44:10,250 --> 01:44:12,711
- It's locked.
- Wait. There's a code.

893
01:44:14,379 --> 01:44:15,797
Come on !

894
01:44:21,136 --> 01:44:23,096
I was just about to get it.

895
01:44:23,138 --> 01:44:26,766
The network is on an intranet. It's
a direct teed into our computer system.

896
01:44:26,850 --> 01:44:31,062
Your station won't have an easier time
reaching the military than I did.

897
01:44:31,104 --> 01:44:33,481
Did they monitor
all the news broadcasts?

898
01:44:33,565 --> 01:44:35,525
Yeah, they did.

899
01:44:35,608 --> 01:44:39,029
All right, we'll go live.
We'll broadcast right from in here.

900
01:44:39,779 --> 01:44:42,407
Hopefully they'll see it.

901
01:44:42,449 --> 01:44:45,660
I'll try to get a message through.

902
01:44:56,629 --> 01:44:59,090
Let's not forget in our rush
to return to the city...

903
01:44:59,174 --> 01:45:01,885
that many people have had their lives
changed forever-

904
01:45:01,968 --> 01:45:05,430
No one in the city has been untouched
by the tragedy.

905
01:45:05,513 --> 01:45:09,851
The sick, the displaced,
the injured--

906
01:45:14,022 --> 01:45:16,441
There's no Ranger game on tonight.

907
01:45:19,778 --> 01:45:22,947
Ed. if you're seeing this.
will you please put us on live?

908
01:45:23,031 --> 01:45:24,991
It's urgent.

909
01:45:25,033 --> 01:45:27,952
I know this sounds crazy,
but you have to do it.

910
01:45:30,121 --> 01:45:31,456
Trust me.

911
01:45:32,332 --> 01:45:34,292
I'm not putting you on live.

912
01:45:34,334 --> 01:45:37,337
- I don't think he'll do it.
- Yes, he will.

913
01:45:38,338 --> 01:45:40,632
All right, Ed? Come on!

914
01:45:44,010 --> 01:45:46,805
See that? They'll be all over the city
if we don't stop them.

915
01:45:49,307 --> 01:45:50,725
Give me a second.

916
01:45:56,606 --> 01:46:00,485
The time has come to return
to our homes and pick up our lives.

917
01:46:00,568 --> 01:46:03,613
- These are the last three.
- Our fears have been allayed-

918
01:46:03,697 --> 01:46:07,158
Thanks to the heroic efforts
of our boys in uniform--

919
01:46:07,200 --> 01:46:08,952
Are we on?

920
01:46:09,035 --> 01:46:11,413
This calculator--

921
01:46:11,496 --> 01:46:13,581
Yeah, you're on.

922
01:46:13,665 --> 01:46:15,625
Yes, you're on. Go!

923
01:46:16,668 --> 01:46:18,628
We're live inside
Madison Square Garden..-

924
01:46:18,712 --> 01:46:22,132
where Dr. Niko Tatopoulos
has discovered the beast's lair.

925
01:46:22,215 --> 01:46:24,843
Doctor, can you tell us
what's happening here?

926
01:46:27,220 --> 01:46:29,931
- That's you, yes. Go, go.
- Thank you.

927
01:46:30,015 --> 01:46:34,019
Well, we've discovered
over 200 eggs-

928
01:46:34,102 --> 01:46:35,687
Go get Hicks.

929
01:46:35,770 --> 01:46:38,940
Which a few moments ago began hatching.

930
01:46:40,066 --> 01:46:44,988
The creatures just hatched are over nine
feet tall, and they've begun feeding.

931
01:46:48,199 --> 01:46:50,952
When their food supply runs out here..-

932
01:46:51,036 --> 01:46:55,290
they will attempt to hunt down food
of their own outside of this nest.

933
01:46:55,373 --> 01:46:58,209
Oh, my God!

934
01:46:58,293 --> 01:47:01,671
If they get out, they'll multiply
and soon a new species will emerge-

935
01:47:03,715 --> 01:47:06,634
One that could replace us as
the dominant species of this planet.

936
01:47:06,718 --> 01:47:09,971
Each one of these amazing reptiles-..

937
01:47:10,055 --> 01:47:12,349
are born pregnant-

938
01:47:12,432 --> 01:47:17,896
Adaptive and cunning, these 200
could become 40,000 within this year.

939
01:47:17,979 --> 01:47:20,857
If the military is listening
to this broadcast-.-

940
01:47:20,940 --> 01:47:23,318
they have to destroy this building
immediately.-.

941
01:47:23,401 --> 01:47:25,320
before these creatures
can escape-

942
01:47:31,451 --> 01:47:33,828
So far they're all trapped
inside this building-.-

943
01:47:33,912 --> 01:47:37,832
but I don't think
we can contain them for long-

944
01:47:37,916 --> 01:47:40,085
They're very strong, agile..-

945
01:47:40,126 --> 01:47:42,671
and they're looking for  food.

946
01:47:42,754 --> 01:47:46,549
So your theory of the creature nesting
turned out to be correct after all.

947
01:47:49,344 --> 01:47:53,181
Regardless of what happens to us,
the most important thing...

948
01:47:53,264 --> 01:47:57,602
is that this building be destroyed
immediately before they escape.

949
01:47:57,686 --> 01:48:00,146
Reporting live
from Madison Square Garden...

950
01:48:00,230 --> 01:48:03,108
this is Audrey Timmonds
for WIDF News.

951
01:48:09,030 --> 01:48:10,865
Thanks, Audrey.

952
01:48:11,950 --> 01:48:13,201
Sure.

953
01:48:23,044 --> 01:48:25,505
That's affirmative.
Let me spell it out for  you.

954
01:48:25,588 --> 01:48:28,550
I want you to blow up
Madison Square Garden.

955
01:48:36,641 --> 01:48:38,601
The good news is they got that message.

956
01:48:38,685 --> 01:48:41,730
The bad news is we've got
less than six minutes to get out.

957
01:48:43,690 --> 01:48:45,984
Party's over.
Time to leave.

958
01:49:00,874 --> 01:49:03,168
Anyone care to join me?

959
01:49:06,713 --> 01:49:10,008
- Where did you find this guy?
- He's from France.

960
01:49:13,511 --> 01:49:15,847
Stallion 1-5s I.P. inbound.

961
01:49:21,936 --> 01:49:23,355
You okay?

962
01:49:25,231 --> 01:49:27,442
Guys, this way. Come on.

963
01:49:28,526 --> 01:49:30,111
Oh, my God! The fish.

964
01:49:31,237 --> 01:49:32,822
Nick, come on!

965
01:49:32,906 --> 01:49:34,866
They've eaten all the fish.

966
01:49:44,250 --> 01:49:46,211
Come on, Nick! This way.

967
01:49:48,213 --> 01:49:50,632
Not this way! Back that way!

968
01:50:02,602 --> 01:50:05,730
- The escalators.
- Hurry!

969
01:50:25,583 --> 01:50:27,419
Stallions, check master arms on.

970
01:50:27,502 --> 01:50:29,254
Two, three.

971
01:50:39,597 --> 01:50:41,266
I think I lost them.

972
01:51:01,369 --> 01:51:05,832
Stallion 1-5 showing a good laser track
on top of the Garden. Selecting L.G.B.

973
01:51:05,874 --> 01:51:09,336
How much time do we have left?

974
01:51:09,419 --> 01:51:11,963
Less than 30 seconds.

975
01:51:22,182 --> 01:51:24,225
Let's go!

976
01:51:36,488 --> 01:51:38,448
Let's go! Come on!

977
01:51:51,461 --> 01:51:52,879
Come on !

978
01:51:58,176 --> 01:51:59,594
Save your Mavericks.

979
01:52:01,554 --> 01:52:02,472
Two away.

980
01:52:20,448 --> 01:52:22,867
Lead has good hits.

981
01:52:40,135 --> 01:52:42,095
Are you all right?

982
01:52:42,178 --> 01:52:43,596
Yeah.

983
01:52:44,764 --> 01:52:47,976
Somehow I never thought your life
was this exciting.

984
01:52:48,685 --> 01:52:50,729
You'd be surprised.

985
01:52:52,188 --> 01:52:54,107
I'd like to find out.

986
01:53:07,454 --> 01:53:09,748
How ya doin'?
You all right?

987
01:53:09,831 --> 01:53:11,791
I could use a coffee.

988
01:54:08,848 --> 01:54:10,642
He looks angry.

989
01:54:13,978 --> 01:54:16,064
What do we do?

990
01:54:16,147 --> 01:54:18,775
Running would be a good idea.

991
01:54:18,858 --> 01:54:20,276
Let's go!

992
01:54:44,426 --> 01:54:45,844
Come on !

993
01:54:58,273 --> 01:55:00,650
- Get in!
- What are you doin'?

994
01:55:37,771 --> 01:55:40,440
You better step on it, Mr. French.

995
01:55:49,949 --> 01:55:52,410
Take 57th Street
and cut up the Westside.

996
01:55:52,452 --> 01:55:54,412
Are you crazy?
Take the FDR.

997
01:55:55,622 --> 01:55:58,249
- The FDR in the rain?
- Got to be a map.

998
01:55:59,959 --> 01:56:02,295
He's gettin' larger!

999
01:56:11,846 --> 01:56:14,432
Take the Westside Highway!

1000
01:56:15,725 --> 01:56:18,603
- I got one.
- The Westside's got construction.

1001
01:56:18,645 --> 01:56:20,730
This is a subway map!

1002
01:56:22,565 --> 01:56:26,111
- Broadway?
- Make up your minds!

1003
01:56:35,078 --> 01:56:37,205
Take Broadway!

1004
01:56:37,288 --> 01:56:40,375
We're traveling down Broadway.

1005
01:56:40,458 --> 01:56:42,919
Make a right on 34th Street.

1006
01:56:59,019 --> 01:57:00,395
That was O'Neal.

1007
01:57:00,478 --> 01:57:02,731
Is everybody okay?
Is everybody all right?

1008
01:57:02,814 --> 01:57:05,775
- Turn around. Do it!
- What? Why?

1009
01:57:19,664 --> 01:57:23,043
Command center, come in.
This is O'Neal for  Hicks.

1010
01:57:44,731 --> 01:57:48,360
- What's going on?
- He's back, sir.

1011
01:57:48,401 --> 01:57:51,029
Godzilla is still alive-

1012
01:57:52,614 --> 01:57:55,492
Lieutenant Rodgers,
are those F-18s still in the air?

1013
01:57:55,575 --> 01:57:57,869
Yes, sir.
They're heading back to the base.

1014
01:57:57,911 --> 01:57:59,371
Turn 'em around.

1015
01:58:30,902 --> 01:58:33,571
- Here it is.
- What are we looking for?

1016
01:58:33,613 --> 01:58:37,158
Every cab company keeps a record...

1017
01:58:37,242 --> 01:58:39,911
of each of its cab's
radio frequencies.

1018
01:58:44,124 --> 01:58:45,250
Bingo!

1019
01:58:51,339 --> 01:58:53,758
He's getting closer!

1020
01:58:56,136 --> 01:58:59,264
In there. Go in the tunnel.

1021
01:59:05,812 --> 01:59:08,398
They've got it blocked.

1022
01:59:15,989 --> 01:59:19,951
- Now where would you like to go?
- Turn off the lights.

1023
01:59:27,667 --> 01:59:30,503
Nick, are you there?
Nick?

1024
01:59:32,505 --> 01:59:35,592
Nice trick with the cab I.D.
Where the hell are you?

1025
01:59:35,675 --> 01:59:38,428
You have to help us.
We're in the--

1026
01:59:38,511 --> 01:59:41,598
Park Avenue Tunnel.

1027
01:59:50,231 --> 01:59:52,567
He's got us trapped in here.

1028
01:59:52,650 --> 01:59:55,820
You guys have got to lure him
out into the open...

1029
01:59:55,862 --> 01:59:58,198
so we can get a clear shot at him-

1030
01:59:58,281 --> 02:00:00,784
No problem. You want us
to wash him up, too?

1031
02:00:05,205 --> 02:00:08,041
- Where's the nearest suspension bridge?
- Brooklyn.

1032
02:00:10,210 --> 02:00:13,505
- Let's go.
- How would you like us to do that?

1033
02:00:13,546 --> 02:00:16,216
This thing have high beams?

1034
02:00:24,057 --> 02:00:25,475
Now!

1035
02:00:35,068 --> 02:00:37,153
He's headed toward the Brooklyn Bridge.

1036
02:00:37,237 --> 02:00:40,031
Target is heading toward
the Brooklyn Bridge, sir.

1037
02:00:40,073 --> 02:00:42,117
Direct the F-18s
to the Brooklyn Bridge.

1038
02:00:49,249 --> 02:00:51,876
- He's not following us!
- Really?

1039
02:01:14,607 --> 02:01:17,068
You gotta be kidding' me.
We're in his mouth.

1040
02:01:17,110 --> 02:01:19,612
We're in his mouth.

1041
02:01:23,867 --> 02:01:26,369
You're goin' the wrong way, man!

1042
02:01:26,453 --> 02:01:27,996
Will you shut up?

1043
02:01:46,056 --> 02:01:48,058
Gun it! Go, go!

1044
02:02:02,989 --> 02:02:04,115
Go, go!

1045
02:02:16,670 --> 02:02:17,754
Move it!

1046
02:02:40,944 --> 02:02:43,279
O'Neal, it worked!

1047
02:02:48,785 --> 02:02:51,037
He's caught in the suspension cables.
Do it!

1048
02:02:51,121 --> 02:02:52,747
- Now!
- Roger.

1049
02:02:56,042 --> 02:02:58,837
Stallion 1-5, tally one on the bridge.

1050
02:03:00,630 --> 02:03:02,048
Fire at will.

1051
02:03:05,427 --> 02:03:06,094
Two away!

1052
02:03:17,022 --> 02:03:18,690
Hurry up, go!

1053
02:03:37,751 --> 02:03:40,712
Direct hit,
but the target is still moving.

1054
02:03:40,795 --> 02:03:42,839
Circle around and tire again!

1055
02:06:10,737 --> 02:06:12,655
That's my husband!

1056
02:06:12,697 --> 02:06:14,657
That's my husband!

1057
02:06:16,076 --> 02:06:18,620
I'm gonna kill him!

1058
02:06:24,834 --> 02:06:26,252
Oh, my.

1059
02:06:26,336 --> 02:06:28,922
Oh, God. Oh, no!

1060
02:06:33,885 --> 02:06:36,346
Wait. Wait.

1061
02:06:36,429 --> 02:06:40,642
We can use this.
"The mayor who destroyed Godzilla."

1062
02:06:40,725 --> 02:06:43,061
I don't think we should exploit this.
It could backfire.

1063
02:06:43,103 --> 02:06:47,148
Listen, idiot. I do the thinking
around here. It's a magnificent idea.

1064
02:06:47,232 --> 02:06:49,818
You know what I think about you
and your campaign?

1065
02:06:51,611 --> 02:06:53,697
Where are you goin'? I need you.

1066
02:06:54,489 --> 02:06:56,324
O'Neal, do you read me?

1067
02:06:57,742 --> 02:06:59,828
Yes, sir.

1068
02:06:59,911 --> 02:07:02,330
That is one hell of a job, soldier.

1069
02:07:03,248 --> 02:07:05,667
That's one hell of a job.

1070
02:07:10,130 --> 02:07:12,090
Roger that, sir.

1071
02:07:14,092 --> 02:07:16,553
Sorry folks.
I've already promised my story...

1072
02:07:16,636 --> 02:07:20,807
as an exclusive to another reporter.

1073
02:07:20,890 --> 02:07:24,561
We did it!
We got the exclusive!

1074
02:07:24,644 --> 02:07:26,146
You're beautiful.

1075
02:07:26,229 --> 02:07:28,690
We did?
I don't think so.

1076
02:07:28,773 --> 02:07:30,483
Remember you work for  me.

1077
02:07:30,567 --> 02:07:33,945
Not anymore, Chuck.
I quit.

1078
02:07:38,658 --> 02:07:40,118
She quits.

1079
02:07:46,791 --> 02:07:49,377
All right, folks,
let's keep it movin'.

1080
02:07:52,672 --> 02:07:55,967
- You take the tape out of the camera?
- No.

1081
02:07:56,051 --> 02:07:59,679
- I couldn't have just lost it.
- Where's Philippe?

1082
02:08:08,605 --> 02:08:09,856
Hello?

1083
02:08:09,939 --> 02:08:12,692
- Hello?
- It's Philippe.

1084
02:08:12,776 --> 02:08:14,402
Where are you?

1085
02:08:14,486 --> 02:08:18,823
Tell your friends I will send the tape
after I've removed a few items from it.

1086
02:08:18,865 --> 02:08:22,452
- I understand.
- I wanted to say au revoir.

1087
02:08:22,535 --> 02:08:25,830
Thank you for  your help, my friend.

1088
02:08:28,124 --> 02:08:30,502
Wait. Hello?

1089
02:08:41,930 --> 02:08:44,724
Who was that French guy anyway?

1090
02:08:44,808 --> 02:08:47,310
Just some insurance guy.

1091
02:08:49,396 --> 02:08:52,190
Did he say anything about my tape?

1092
02:08:52,273 --> 02:08:54,609
Yeah, he said something
about your tape.

1093
02:08:54,693 --> 02:08:58,571
- Does he have my tape or not?
- Yeah, he has your tape.

1094
