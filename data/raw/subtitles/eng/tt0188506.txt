1
00:00:05,692 --> 00:00:11,304
The Monkeys' Castle

2
00:00:14,383 --> 00:00:16,383
In the beginning...

3
00:00:17,273 --> 00:00:21,570
...the monkeys lived freely and happily
on the grasslands of the savannah.

4
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:26,242
Their only concern
was to bask in the sun...

5
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:28,875
...or in the shade of a bush,
according to their mood.

6
00:00:30,727 --> 00:00:36,156
But this peaceful existence would be
turned upside down by a terrible cataclysm.

7
00:00:37,476 --> 00:00:40,171
Under a black sky crossed by lightning,

8
00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:44,742
from far away, an enormous wave
swept across the savannah.

9
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:49,296
Panic-stricken by the threat
of being engulfed by the water,

10
00:00:49,422 --> 00:00:52,742
the monkeys rushed
into the forest close by.

11
00:00:54,797 --> 00:00:58,046
Many were drowned
before reaching the trees...

12
00:00:58,313 --> 00:00:59,882
But some of them...

13
00:01:00,461 --> 00:01:03,648
...managed to grasp the lowest branches...

14
00:01:03,687 --> 00:01:05,500
...then up the huge trunks...

15
00:01:05,563 --> 00:01:07,609
...to the very top of the forest...

16
00:01:08,156 --> 00:01:09,726
 ...called "The Canopy".

17
00:01:12,413 --> 00:01:16,132
Now, that time has passed...
into oblivion...

18
00:01:16,991 --> 00:01:18,702
In other words...

19
00:01:19,929 --> 00:01:21,859
...a long time has passed.

20
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,585
Come on son,
don't stop now!

21
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,269
Go on, be brave... jump!

22
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:29,284
Go go, you can do it!

23
00:02:29,792 --> 00:02:32,174
1, 2, 3.

24
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:08,126
Missed!
Still think you can do it, Grandpa?

25
00:03:08,369 --> 00:03:11,009
Maybe you will some day.

26
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:17,221
Cheeky little rascal!

27
00:04:00,296 --> 00:04:03,522
It's incredible that you
can't stop being a devil.

28
00:04:05,687 --> 00:04:08,116
Well, where's the harm in it?

29
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:12,226
If you two have finished,
Master Korkona gives his lesson today.

30
00:04:12,312 --> 00:04:15,874
So instead of this stupid bickering,
you'd do better to go listen to him.

31
00:04:15,976 --> 00:04:17,976
All right Mum, we'll go.

32
00:04:18,148 --> 00:04:22,663
Are you serious? The last time,
Kom didn't stop poking fun at him.

33
00:04:23,234 --> 00:04:26,968
Yeah, I couldn't help it...
Korkona's a silly old fart.

34
00:04:27,492 --> 00:04:30,562
But I'll try and behave this time.
Come on!

35
00:04:31,452 --> 00:04:32,546
Be careful!

36
00:04:35,211 --> 00:04:37,031
They can't do without each other.

37
00:04:39,053 --> 00:04:41,326
See who's first to the top!

38
00:04:42,631 --> 00:04:44,631
Watch out!

39
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,639
Hold the vine for me!

40
00:04:53,717 --> 00:04:55,717
Thank you, Ma'am!

41
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:08,568
Ssh!

42
00:05:11,725 --> 00:05:13,725
Yah yah yah!

43
00:05:19,807 --> 00:05:22,900
You utter the cry of the grand oath
of the Wunkos...

44
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,323
Everything at the top is good...

45
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,135
And everything down below is bad!

46
00:05:34,573 --> 00:05:38,924
So why would anyone risk falling
into that dreadful world?

47
00:05:39,604 --> 00:05:44,291
Be aware, that those who took
such a risk, never came back.

48
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:46,189
However...

49
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:47,994
...we always have a choice...

50
00:05:48,026 --> 00:05:50,674
...because there are two sides
to everything in the universe.

51
00:05:51,252 --> 00:05:53,252
Look at those blue flowers
over there.

52
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:54,658
They're in 2 parts.

53
00:05:54,674 --> 00:05:59,118
The lower part, that drops in autumn,
is a potent poison.

54
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,725
Yes, bad!

55
00:06:00,838 --> 00:06:02,328
So what?

56
00:06:02,636 --> 00:06:04,210
Don't interrupt!

57
00:06:04,342 --> 00:06:08,131
The upper part of the flower, that stays,
is an antidote to the poison.

58
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:09,876
Yeah!

59
00:06:10,462 --> 00:06:13,268
The world is like
those blue flowers...

60
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:16,737
Good up high, bad down low.

61
00:06:16,887 --> 00:06:19,597
Above all, young Wunkos...

62
00:06:20,394 --> 00:06:22,609
Stay on your branches!

63
00:06:22,828 --> 00:06:25,835
Hey, Master Korkona,
just one little question...

64
00:06:26,072 --> 00:06:27,775
A question?

65
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:30,433
There will be no questions!

66
00:06:30,512 --> 00:06:33,708
How do you know that everything
is bad down there...

67
00:06:34,766 --> 00:06:37,039
...when you say nobody
has ever come back?

68
00:06:37,258 --> 00:06:38,508
Shut up, Kom!

69
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:40,893
There will be no questions!

70
00:06:41,073 --> 00:06:43,760
Well I'm quite sure
I can look after myself.

71
00:06:44,308 --> 00:06:45,984
One of these days
I'll go down there.

72
00:06:46,092 --> 00:06:48,092
He's really crazy!

73
00:06:48,234 --> 00:06:49,764
That's how I am.

74
00:06:49,968 --> 00:06:53,416
It's logical...
Everything that goes up in the air...

75
00:06:55,347 --> 00:06:57,563
...wants to come down again.

76
00:06:57,706 --> 00:06:59,706
Even cherries know that.

77
00:07:00,812 --> 00:07:02,812
Will you never shut up?!

78
00:07:02,954 --> 00:07:06,027
Korkona wants us to be
lily-livered like squirrels.

79
00:07:06,976 --> 00:07:09,693
Why? I can't see why
I can't go down..

80
00:07:10,134 --> 00:07:11,638
And some things are better.

81
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,362
The branches are thicker,
and you can dance on them.

82
00:07:14,523 --> 00:07:19,237
Dance? I guarantee you'd be
dancing to a strange tune.

83
00:07:19,444 --> 00:07:26,115
Let me tell you, in case you don't know,
what awaits you down there.

84
00:07:33,782 --> 00:07:36,609
There, it is a world of darkness...

85
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:39,546
...where everything is only terror,
suffering, and sorrow.

86
00:07:40,351 --> 00:07:42,843
Everything down there is bad.

87
00:07:43,011 --> 00:07:45,573
Everything up here is good.

88
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,113
That's what I bend over backwards
to tell you.

89
00:07:52,715 --> 00:07:55,413
Get that into your thick skull!

90
00:07:56,305 --> 00:08:00,146
Now go home,
and stick to the branches!

91
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:08,083
You know Margad, the stories of
that one-eyed old man don't scare me.

92
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,452
Don't call him that...
He can't help he's lost an eye.

93
00:08:11,594 --> 00:08:13,594
Yeah, but he CAN help it
if he's a liar.

94
00:08:13,975 --> 00:08:16,695
I bet he invents everything
that he goes on about.

95
00:08:16,922 --> 00:08:18,814
Well, you just stop
with all that!

96
00:08:19,014 --> 00:08:21,014
Come on, we're going to get soaked.

97
00:08:21,491 --> 00:08:24,865
As he only has one eye,
it makes sense he can only see half.

98
00:08:25,072 --> 00:08:25,898
Whatever.

99
00:08:26,046 --> 00:08:27,749
I'll say no more.

100
00:08:29,238 --> 00:08:32,790
Like his story of the blue flowers.
What a laugh!

101
00:08:35,322 --> 00:08:38,772
Say Margad... look down below.
See that light?

102
00:08:38,876 --> 00:08:41,439
Careful how you go...
It's slippery.

103
00:08:41,984 --> 00:08:44,476
Wait here...
I'll go down a bit further.

104
00:08:44,547 --> 00:08:45,977
No, don't be stupid!

105
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,376
Kom... come back!

106
00:08:49,732 --> 00:08:51,509
Don't do that!

107
00:09:21,312 --> 00:09:23,989
NO!

108
00:10:15,257 --> 00:10:19,160
Your Majesty, it's getting darker and darker.
We should go back.

109
00:10:19,301 --> 00:10:22,607
You're right, Ludovic,
but our friend the tiger is not very far.

110
00:10:22,871 --> 00:10:24,871
Let's go on a bit further.

111
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,400
- Your Majesty!
- No, he's mine!

112
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,459
Giddyup!

113
00:10:40,634 --> 00:10:42,903
After the tiger!

114
00:11:03,903 --> 00:11:05,903
Ah, he's a gallant tiger!

115
00:11:06,388 --> 00:11:08,231
Well done, my friend!

116
00:11:08,937 --> 00:11:10,515
He almost killed us this time.

117
00:11:11,628 --> 00:11:13,628
He's truly an opponent
worthy of me.

118
00:11:13,929 --> 00:11:15,929
He deserves a better chance.

119
00:11:16,536 --> 00:11:18,449
Tonight, we'll go back to the castle.

120
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,998
Hear them up there?

121
00:11:35,093 --> 00:11:36,356
They're the Wunkos...

122
00:11:36,684 --> 00:11:38,739
They say there are
thousands up in the branches

123
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:42,351
It seems they're all naked
and sick, and full of vermin.

124
00:11:42,609 --> 00:11:45,742
I reckon that one of these days,
they'll come down to invade us.

125
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,843
If the Wunkos are naked and sick,
they can't be very dangerous.

126
00:12:02,374 --> 00:12:04,918
Your majesty, come here, look!

127
00:12:07,882 --> 00:12:09,882
Here's one that won't hurt us.

128
00:12:10,472 --> 00:12:13,501
Be careful, stay there,
you never know with them.

129
00:12:13,623 --> 00:12:15,379
Nothing to fear...
He's dead I tell you.

130
00:12:15,929 --> 00:12:19,534
He moved, be careful!
He can still bite.

131
00:12:19,761 --> 00:12:20,980
Kill him!

132
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:23,097
No...!

133
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,665
Don't kill him.

134
00:12:27,103 --> 00:12:30,892
But majesty it's a Wunko, one of those beasts
that fell from up there.

135
00:12:31,053 --> 00:12:32,537
He must be killed,
Your Majesty.

136
00:12:32,592 --> 00:12:34,829
We'll take him back
to the castle, alive.

137
00:12:35,483 --> 00:12:39,044
I want him treated
and entrusted to Master Flavus.

138
00:12:39,273 --> 00:12:40,999
As you wish, Your Majesty.

139
00:12:41,137 --> 00:12:43,715
You heard... pick him up gently.

140
00:12:45,619 --> 00:12:47,535
The king's gone mad!

141
00:12:47,847 --> 00:12:49,695
In any case,
there's no way I'll touch him.

142
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:52,679
Why? Are you afraid
of catching a sickness?

143
00:12:55,971 --> 00:13:00,153
Well, it won't be a problem for me,
I hope.

144
00:13:16,225 --> 00:13:19,779
That land over there...
on the other side...

145
00:13:20,115 --> 00:13:21,849
We can see it clearly this evening.

146
00:13:22,615 --> 00:13:25,924
Sometimes it disappears entirely,
like a mirage.

147
00:13:26,027 --> 00:13:28,396
One day, I'll take you
to that country, Ludovic.

148
00:13:28,868 --> 00:13:31,485
That's the dream of all Lankos
since the dawn of time.

149
00:13:31,673 --> 00:13:36,019
Yes, since the land in between
was drowned in the terrible flood.

150
00:13:36,746 --> 00:13:39,554
Maybe it's just an impossible dream.

151
00:13:40,245 --> 00:13:42,245
But what would life be
without dreams?

152
00:13:43,268 --> 00:13:45,932
What's the matter?

153
00:13:46,143 --> 00:13:47,463
Get along!

154
00:14:29,409 --> 00:14:33,419
Your Highness,
the sunset is beautiful.

155
00:14:34,856 --> 00:14:37,356
Would you like to walk
in the garden?

156
00:14:37,608 --> 00:14:39,608
She won't answer.

157
00:14:39,817 --> 00:14:42,019
The princess is out of our world.

158
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:44,339
It's useless to stay here.

159
00:14:45,374 --> 00:14:46,467
Look...!

160
00:14:47,108 --> 00:14:48,903
Look, she's trying to talk to us.

161
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:51,367
Just attend to your chores, Gina,
you're just a servant.

162
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:54,079
I'm taking care of the princess.
Go outside!

163
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,850
Housekeeper, tell me what happened.

164
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:05,109
She tried to talk to the servant,
Sire.

165
00:15:05,134 --> 00:15:07,686
If that happens, we'll have
no end of trouble.

166
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,792
Make sure it never does happen.

167
00:15:11,305 --> 00:15:13,758
That's right...
put more in.

168
00:15:19,988 --> 00:15:21,988
Here, dear princess...

169
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:33,778
For a daughter of a king,
I find you very obedient.

170
00:15:46,428 --> 00:15:48,276
Master Flavus!

171
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,370
What is it, Gina?

172
00:15:50,581 --> 00:15:52,941
Princess Sida tried to talk to me.

173
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:57,126
But that ugly witch of a housekeeper
threw me out,

174
00:15:57,588 --> 00:16:00,072
I'm sure if I took care of her...

175
00:16:00,221 --> 00:16:03,156
Gina, you know quite well
the poor child is very sick.

176
00:16:03,219 --> 00:16:07,141
The king's doctors can do nothing
for her. How could you help her?

177
00:16:08,118 --> 00:16:10,516
By discovering what's in the broth
that the housekeeper is giving her.

178
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:13,337
I don't trust that old witch.

179
00:16:13,687 --> 00:16:16,035
Gina, you're a good girl...

180
00:16:16,152 --> 00:16:19,055
But don't think I'm going to go
looking for conspiracies everywhere.

181
00:16:19,156 --> 00:16:20,296
Why not?

182
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,362
YOU might find one.

183
00:16:24,027 --> 00:16:26,660
Is this the savage who fell
out of the trees?

184
00:16:26,991 --> 00:16:28,747
Don't they hide their ears?

185
00:16:29,163 --> 00:16:30,622
Never? Really?!

186
00:16:30,774 --> 00:16:33,922
Apparently no, no more
than the rest of their body.

187
00:16:35,021 --> 00:16:38,873
He's weird.
Can I touch him?

188
00:16:39,093 --> 00:16:40,756
Of course Gina.

189
00:16:40,835 --> 00:16:43,834
You're not going to believe
what's said about these creatures.

190
00:16:44,201 --> 00:16:45,654
He looks normal.

191
00:16:45,783 --> 00:16:48,648
He has the same body as us.

192
00:16:48,836 --> 00:16:52,744
Exactly, the same hands,
the same nose, the same ears.

193
00:16:53,065 --> 00:16:57,642
I think we have the same ancestors,
and that won't please everyone.

194
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:13,191
We've worked on it for months now,
and still don't know what it is.

195
00:17:13,567 --> 00:17:15,971
And during that time,
what's the castle become?

196
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:19,772
If you ask me...
an asylum for wild beasts.

197
00:17:20,534 --> 00:17:22,732
The king is too tender-hearted.

198
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:24,656
And the princess has gone
soft in the head.

199
00:17:24,857 --> 00:17:28,286
Careful what you say.
Remember, the trees have ears.

200
00:17:28,635 --> 00:17:31,237
And the Gorilla, the spy
of the Grand Chancellor.

201
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,300
They often snoop around here.

202
00:17:33,543 --> 00:17:36,098
The Grand Chancellor...
I don't like him much.

203
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,619
But without him, the castle
would really go to pieces.

204
00:17:38,908 --> 00:17:42,095
So, did you find out what it was?

205
00:17:42,455 --> 00:17:44,927
No, not even the workers know.

206
00:17:45,044 --> 00:17:47,459
But I did learn something else.

207
00:17:47,632 --> 00:17:51,100
The king brought back a Wunko,
a savage of the forest.

208
00:17:51,414 --> 00:17:55,533
Maybe you could allow me
to quietly kill him.

209
00:17:55,887 --> 00:17:57,623
You stupid imbecile!

210
00:17:57,717 --> 00:18:00,278
I know very well you have
no information for me.

211
00:18:00,481 --> 00:18:02,878
How did you ever deserve that medal?

212
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,564
You're the stupidest monkey
in the castle.

213
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:07,903
Look again.

214
00:18:08,628 --> 00:18:14,215
I want to know what the king is having built,
with this latest eccentricity.

215
00:18:14,769 --> 00:18:18,161
And if you want to amuse yourself
with that wild beast...

216
00:18:18,446 --> 00:18:21,512
Oh, thank you Sire,
oh what a joy!

217
00:18:23,828 --> 00:18:28,011
I have never been able to separate
his majesty from his dreams.

218
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:30,839
They are futile no doubt.

219
00:18:31,263 --> 00:18:34,234
But one of them...
maybe this strange object...

220
00:18:34,275 --> 00:18:36,275
...may gain him the people's confidence.

221
00:18:36,455 --> 00:18:40,082
And that would ruin all my hopes!

222
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:14,673
A demon... Help!

223
00:19:18,175 --> 00:19:19,742
You finally woke up?

224
00:19:20,281 --> 00:19:21,885
Like a bowl of soup?

225
00:19:22,003 --> 00:19:23,426
Is that a demon?

226
00:19:24,194 --> 00:19:26,186
Who's giving me food?

227
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:31,866
Come on, little savage,
and have your soup.

228
00:19:32,531 --> 00:19:34,445
But come here...
Why are you running away?

229
00:19:34,492 --> 00:19:36,585
I promise the soup is nice.

230
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:39,196
Don't be scared.
I won't hurt you.

231
00:19:42,271 --> 00:19:45,055
Oh no, my goodness,
what are you doing up there?

232
00:19:45,407 --> 00:19:47,407
You don't understand
what I'm saying.

233
00:19:48,475 --> 00:19:49,802
Me... friend.

234
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,281
You... hungry.

235
00:19:52,648 --> 00:19:54,326
Eat... soup.

236
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:56,136
She's really very pretty.

237
00:19:56,797 --> 00:19:58,970
No, it must be a trick
of the demons.

238
00:19:59,173 --> 00:20:02,133
Yum! Yum! it's delicious.

239
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:05,749
Alright, as you wish.

240
00:20:06,491 --> 00:20:09,448
If you're going to be stupid,
I'll just leave it.

241
00:20:10,487 --> 00:20:13,425
Do you understand that
what I'm telling you means well?

242
00:20:19,265 --> 00:20:24,046
She's really the most beautiful girl,
and I behave like a wild beast.

243
00:21:00,473 --> 00:21:02,115
They're not demons!

244
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,499
If only Margad could see this!

245
00:21:09,553 --> 00:21:12,748
My son... now my only son...

246
00:21:13,034 --> 00:21:14,815
You know our customs.

247
00:21:15,277 --> 00:21:18,780
Those who fall must not stay
in our memories.

248
00:21:19,062 --> 00:21:21,666
You must forget Kom
and live your life.

249
00:21:22,471 --> 00:21:26,907
What if he's stopped from climbing back up,
because he's a prisoner of demons?

250
00:21:27,095 --> 00:21:29,627
Margad, your brother is a prisoner of death.

251
00:21:29,815 --> 00:21:32,511
And let the example of Kom
be a lesson.

252
00:21:33,009 --> 00:21:35,891
He thought himself smarter
than anyone else.

253
00:21:36,353 --> 00:21:38,946
And I guarantee that demons
are torturing him...

254
00:21:39,329 --> 00:21:41,329
...and he's full of regret.

255
00:21:47,095 --> 00:21:50,063
We certainly can't deny...

256
00:21:50,829 --> 00:21:53,657
...that Kom has great adaptability.

257
00:21:53,923 --> 00:21:58,165
It would be nice if he could adapt
to say something like "thank you".

258
00:21:59,845 --> 00:22:01,571
Thank you, Gina.

259
00:22:01,751 --> 00:22:04,665
So why haven't you said anything before?

260
00:22:05,025 --> 00:22:07,025
I didn't know if you were
good monkeys or not.

261
00:22:07,267 --> 00:22:08,977
So what reassured you?

262
00:22:09,126 --> 00:22:11,126
Just an impression.

263
00:22:12,227 --> 00:22:16,571
<i>Emotive rather than logical.
Intuitive and non-indicative.</i>

264
00:22:16,931 --> 00:22:18,329
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

265
00:22:18,431 --> 00:22:19,446
Why is that?

266
00:22:19,697 --> 00:22:22,087
Because I've no idea
what it means.

267
00:22:26,103 --> 00:22:28,274
<i>He is not devoid of
a certain sense of humour.</i>

268
00:22:28,509 --> 00:22:30,642
We shall now proceed
to his education.

269
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:32,087
And what is that?

270
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:34,485
A lot of nonsense
you must learn...

271
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:37,485
...so as not to displease the lords
and ladies of the castle.

272
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,422
It's important if you want to be
presented to his majesty the king.

273
00:22:40,509 --> 00:22:41,891
What's a king?

274
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:44,345
He saved you when you fell
into the jungle.

275
00:22:44,868 --> 00:22:47,391
Yes... teach me all that
as quick as you can.

276
00:22:48,134 --> 00:22:49,885
With patience,
you'll learn the sciences...

277
00:22:49,909 --> 00:22:53,072
mathematical calculation
and geography...

278
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:58,182
life, philosophy, etiquette,
and the latest in ancient mechanics.

279
00:22:58,206 --> 00:22:59,807
Assimilate...

280
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,283
Assimilate to be civilised.

281
00:23:03,432 --> 00:23:05,041
Assimilate...

282
00:23:05,752 --> 00:23:08,322
Assimilate to be civilised.

283
00:23:08,362 --> 00:23:10,869
Learn morality and
to conduct yourself in society...

284
00:23:11,133 --> 00:23:14,057
and blow your nose like a princess and
step like a royal, dancing gaily

285
00:23:14,135 --> 00:23:16,432
in the salons... to the music
of the violins.

286
00:23:16,456 --> 00:23:18,361
Do what you're told,
and you'll know it all....

287
00:23:18,455 --> 00:23:23,252
and be assimilated...
assimilated to be civilised.

288
00:23:23,393 --> 00:23:25,393
There, I'll learn as well...

289
00:23:25,876 --> 00:23:33,305
What I want to know about life... where
I'm going... where I'm from... who I am.

290
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:38,002
Of course, my boy, everything is here
on the life of mosquitoes in the wetlands.

291
00:23:38,377 --> 00:23:40,846
Modesty and the laws
of Homeric dress...

292
00:23:40,948 --> 00:23:43,369
Never show anything
of your anatomy!

293
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:48,353
Assimilate... Assimilate to be civilised.

294
00:23:49,049 --> 00:23:53,002
Yes, but our anatomy
pales before astronomy...

295
00:23:53,268 --> 00:23:55,932
When the sun drowns in the sea
to end the day...

296
00:23:55,957 --> 00:23:58,436
It's not he who goes away,
but you who turns around.

297
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:03,307
Learn Latin and Greek and you'll find
everything you want in this library.

298
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:08,385
Assimilate... Assimilate to be civilised.

299
00:24:08,479 --> 00:24:14,057
Assimilate... Assimilate to be civilised.

300
00:24:19,924 --> 00:24:22,603
Here is the library
where we are right now.

301
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,869
The servants live down below
with the cooks, kitchen boys and guards.

302
00:24:26,971 --> 00:24:29,947
The upper floors are reserved
for senior monkeys...

303
00:24:30,026 --> 00:24:33,564
musicians, courtiers, architects,
advisors etc..

304
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:35,931
You don't have the right
to go up there.

305
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:39,338
The king lives at the very top
of the tower.

306
00:24:40,081 --> 00:24:42,658
How is it known
if you're a superior monkey?

307
00:24:43,112 --> 00:24:45,447
It's according to the height
of your living quarters.

308
00:24:46,103 --> 00:24:49,704
Then we Wunkos are very superior,
since we live at the top of the trees.

309
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:53,643
Well said, Kom!

310
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:59,393
Of course the stars you see
are not as big as our world.

311
00:25:00,127 --> 00:25:04,330
Maybe they just seem smaller
because they're a long way away.

312
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:06,471
I never thought of that.

313
00:25:08,877 --> 00:25:10,783
Is that your drinking-water tank?

314
00:25:10,995 --> 00:25:14,072
Oh, no, Kom... it's cursed.

315
00:25:14,393 --> 00:25:16,525
We shouldn't touch it,
let alone drink it.

316
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,322
We can't even swim there?

317
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:23,931
Well, it's forbidden
to learn to swim.

318
00:25:24,002 --> 00:25:26,932
Some say it's a divine punishment
of the gods...

319
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:31,971
Others say that a huge monster
hides beneath the surface...

320
00:25:32,516 --> 00:25:35,572
...and if he wakes up
he'll swallow the whole castle.

321
00:25:35,823 --> 00:25:37,353
That sounds like our Korkona.

322
00:25:37,924 --> 00:25:41,072
Don't tell me that you swallow
everything you're told, too?!

323
00:25:44,505 --> 00:25:45,822
What's that over there?

324
00:25:45,948 --> 00:25:47,400
We call it a labyrinth.

325
00:25:47,471 --> 00:25:50,197
It's a sort of a game,
where you start there...

326
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,924
and you have to come out there.

327
00:25:53,409 --> 00:25:54,924
OK... I get it.

328
00:25:55,764 --> 00:25:56,893
Watch!

329
00:25:57,877 --> 00:26:01,283
At last the little savage
has escaped his minder!

330
00:26:01,409 --> 00:26:04,634
I'll hide in the labyrinth
and catch him!

331
00:26:09,612 --> 00:26:11,807
No, you're doing it the wrong way!

332
00:26:12,135 --> 00:26:14,369
Look at the trouble
you're giving the gardeners...

333
00:26:14,611 --> 00:26:16,603
You're ruining their work.

334
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:20,463
You have to find the way out
by going between the hedges.

335
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,572
Even if we don't have to?

336
00:26:22,635 --> 00:26:24,564
This is called sport.

337
00:26:24,596 --> 00:26:28,963
The pleasure is in managing
to find your way out. See?

338
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,025
What? For no reason?

339
00:26:31,213 --> 00:26:34,939
Yes, the reason is to prove to yourself
that you don't need a reason.

340
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,416
I find that ridiculous.

341
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:38,659
But it's easy to do.

342
00:26:45,985 --> 00:26:49,463
Master Flavius, ​​I managed
to do something useless...

343
00:26:49,659 --> 00:26:51,408
Am I civilized now?

344
00:26:52,471 --> 00:26:58,393
Help! Gardeners! Get me out of here!
What's happening?

345
00:27:11,987 --> 00:27:14,377
You idiot, you scared me!

346
00:27:14,471 --> 00:27:17,096
Watch out I'm a tiger
and I'm very hungry.

347
00:27:24,838 --> 00:27:27,416
Stop it, Kom, you'll ruin your clothes.

348
00:27:28,533 --> 00:27:30,939
Look at all these apples...
they're ripe.

349
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:32,314
Can they be picked?

350
00:27:32,377 --> 00:27:33,971
You can't climb.

351
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,416
Teach me.

352
00:27:39,229 --> 00:27:40,822
That's fine, Gina, keep going.

353
00:27:41,065 --> 00:27:43,455
Give me your hand... that's it!

354
00:27:50,385 --> 00:27:51,861
Nearly there!

355
00:27:53,081 --> 00:27:55,807
That's it!
I managed to climb a tree.

356
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:58,760
Next time I'll jump
from one branch to another.

357
00:27:59,533 --> 00:28:01,518
I hope nobody saw us.

358
00:28:01,588 --> 00:28:02,322
Why?

359
00:28:02,393 --> 00:28:07,033
Because I'm a Lankom and we mustn't
behave like primitive monkeys.

360
00:28:07,635 --> 00:28:09,713
Well, what does that make me?

361
00:28:10,291 --> 00:28:11,971
You're not a primitive.

362
00:28:12,244 --> 00:28:13,588
You're a savage.

363
00:28:13,916 --> 00:28:15,439
My little savage.

364
00:28:26,228 --> 00:28:30,682
Damn it, I'm going to tear his hair out,
one hair at a time.

365
00:28:30,823 --> 00:28:35,244
I'll cut his ears into slices and
make him swallow them with chilli.

366
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:39,150
I'm going to have fun
with this little savage.

367
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:41,135
Oh, it's only me!

368
00:28:49,581 --> 00:28:53,564
My little gorilla, let's go there
without making any noise.

369
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:19,923
Double, double toil and trouble;
Fire burn and cauldron bubble.

370
00:29:20,502 --> 00:29:22,502
Into the cauldron goes the poison.

371
00:29:34,002 --> 00:29:35,494
Sire...!

372
00:29:36,081 --> 00:29:38,736
I've no time to listen
to your nonsense.

373
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:43,283
A strange thing made
to walk in the water.

374
00:29:43,596 --> 00:29:45,760
What are you prattling about?

375
00:29:46,713 --> 00:29:49,846
Look what I found
in Master Flavius's rooms.

376
00:29:50,002 --> 00:29:51,111
What?

377
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:55,899
Impossible! The water in the lake
is untouchable.

378
00:29:55,948 --> 00:29:57,963
Not even the king would dare.

379
00:29:58,651 --> 00:30:01,275
Though I guess he might be
capable of it.

380
00:30:02,971 --> 00:30:06,705
Oh my god, a traitor's life
is a very difficult one.

381
00:30:06,932 --> 00:30:08,932
Oh yes, oh yes!

382
00:30:32,557 --> 00:30:35,369
Good lord! A savage!
What a stench!

383
00:30:38,979 --> 00:30:42,650
- It's shameful!
- Oh my god, what a scandal!

384
00:30:50,859 --> 00:30:55,111
Your Majesty, honourable courtiers
of the castle...

385
00:30:55,416 --> 00:30:59,002
Before presenting young Kom
to this noble assembly...

386
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:05,596
...we did our best to give this
very young specimen a little education.

387
00:31:05,846 --> 00:31:08,228
You could have taught him
to cover his ears...!

388
00:31:08,385 --> 00:31:12,268
It is an outrage to so appear
before His Majesty!

389
00:31:30,268 --> 00:31:32,932
Sorry! Please forgive me.

390
00:31:33,526 --> 00:31:36,525
I wasn't aware that ears
were such a big deal with you.

391
00:31:37,049 --> 00:31:39,049
Do you know why you hide them?

392
00:31:39,127 --> 00:31:41,127
Are you ashamed of them?

393
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,541
Come here, Kom!

394
00:31:42,674 --> 00:31:47,400
Excuse us Your Majesty...
his education isn't quite finished.

395
00:31:47,791 --> 00:31:50,643
I confess he still has difficulties
with hair and dress...

396
00:31:50,854 --> 00:31:54,682
But nevertheless, Your Majesty...

397
00:31:54,721 --> 00:31:57,768
Your Honourable Majesty...

398
00:31:58,065 --> 00:32:02,783
by conducting some empirical experiments...
both naturalistic and prosaic...

399
00:32:06,314 --> 00:32:08,072
Why did you make that noise?

400
00:32:09,034 --> 00:32:12,197
Sorry but it's the cry of boredom,
Your Honourable Majesty.

401
00:32:12,377 --> 00:32:16,220
I can see you're bored,
listening to all those useless words.

402
00:32:16,541 --> 00:32:18,541
I'm bored, too!

403
00:32:18,674 --> 00:32:21,150
We Lankoms don't have such a cry.

404
00:32:21,463 --> 00:32:24,682
That doesn't surprise me at all.
You talk too much...

405
00:32:24,956 --> 00:32:26,580
...and don't scream enough.

406
00:32:26,605 --> 00:32:28,088
That's quite enough!

407
00:32:28,442 --> 00:32:31,338
Here is a very good example
of frankness and spontaneity...

408
00:32:31,479 --> 00:32:35,752
...which might be called
"prima dialecta naturaliste".

409
00:32:35,807 --> 00:32:39,346
Tell me, do you have a cry for "silence"?

410
00:32:39,573 --> 00:32:40,978
Yes, Your Majesty.

411
00:32:48,713 --> 00:32:51,674
Why does your people
use so many different cries?

412
00:32:52,409 --> 00:32:56,346
Up there we don't always
have time for conversation.

413
00:32:56,502 --> 00:32:58,361
When there's danger
you must act quickly...

414
00:32:58,635 --> 00:33:00,447
The cry is most practical.

415
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,674
There's the cry of anger...

416
00:33:05,987 --> 00:33:06,916
Of fear...

417
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:12,221
You can welcome
the return of the sun...

418
00:33:12,354 --> 00:33:14,354
Or the return
of your girlfriend.

419
00:33:15,705 --> 00:33:18,845
Or sun and girlfriend together.

420
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,150
You hear...?

421
00:33:21,034 --> 00:33:25,166
Amazing... a real language
without useless words.

422
00:33:25,354 --> 00:33:27,354
Give us some more examples.

423
00:33:37,719 --> 00:33:39,719
Tell me what that says.

424
00:33:39,791 --> 00:33:41,330
It's the cry of love.

425
00:33:41,541 --> 00:33:43,572
You seem to know it.

426
00:33:43,783 --> 00:33:45,549
Plenty of experience, eh?

427
00:33:46,245 --> 00:33:48,385
Now... everyone together...

428
00:33:48,588 --> 00:33:50,588
The cry of love!

429
00:33:50,651 --> 00:33:52,861
1... 2... 3!

430
00:33:58,384 --> 00:33:59,783
Wonderful!

431
00:33:59,979 --> 00:34:02,596
Entertaining and instructive,
at the same time.

432
00:34:02,861 --> 00:34:04,759
Don't you agree,
Chancellor?

433
00:34:05,064 --> 00:34:06,587
What's faithfulness?

434
00:34:12,518 --> 00:34:15,424
Bravo Chancellor!
You do that very well.

435
00:34:31,221 --> 00:34:33,330
Sire... she got away!

436
00:34:42,173 --> 00:34:44,189
My child... my darling...!

437
00:34:45,745 --> 00:34:46,830
Father...

438
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,283
If she speaks to him...

439
00:34:48,549 --> 00:34:52,033
...we'll be in a very unpleasant situation.

440
00:34:52,525 --> 00:34:53,627
Listen...

441
00:34:55,221 --> 00:34:56,557
Music!

442
00:34:57,198 --> 00:34:58,455
Music!

443
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,220
Kom, come here quickly!

444
00:36:11,862 --> 00:36:13,260
The king wants to see you.

445
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:16,010
He's right upstairs.
Hurry.

446
00:36:21,495 --> 00:36:23,495
You asked to see me,
Your Majesty?

447
00:36:23,987 --> 00:36:25,525
Tell me, little Wunko...

448
00:36:26,377 --> 00:36:28,424
I want you to amuse me, some more.

449
00:36:29,495 --> 00:36:31,408
You'll be my jester.

450
00:36:31,651 --> 00:36:33,651
A jester's job
is to amuse his king.

451
00:36:33,846 --> 00:36:36,478
Never forget that I only
need to snap my fingers...

452
00:36:37,135 --> 00:36:38,603
...to send you back
to the jungle...

453
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:41,252
...where our friend the tiger
will make mouthful of you.

454
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,393
For me, Kom.

455
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,760
I can't forget her little face...

456
00:36:48,815 --> 00:36:50,893
...as white and motionless
as if it were dead.

457
00:36:51,307 --> 00:36:52,447
Make me laugh.

458
00:36:53,401 --> 00:36:54,994
I'm very sorry Your Majesty...

459
00:36:55,674 --> 00:36:58,939
You see, it's very difficult for me
to make people laugh on demand.

460
00:36:59,237 --> 00:37:02,861
I'll give you anything you want...
gold, rich clothes... you name it.

461
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:05,822
I'd like to see my brother again,
to tell him I'm alive.

462
00:37:06,058 --> 00:37:07,174
Very well...

463
00:37:07,963 --> 00:37:09,963
I'll take you to your country, Kom.

464
00:37:11,299 --> 00:37:13,807
- Look...!
- What is it?

465
00:37:15,689 --> 00:37:18,121
A flying machine.

466
00:37:18,189 --> 00:37:20,267
Flying? Wow!

467
00:37:21,283 --> 00:37:26,666
Come on, be good, and don't be afraid.
We'll do a test flight.

468
00:37:34,917 --> 00:37:36,784
It's not dangerous.

469
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:39,229
Of course, but it's very exciting.

470
00:38:10,892 --> 00:38:12,892
Well, it works doesn't it?

471
00:38:13,142 --> 00:38:17,189
I promise you that next time
we'll fly even higher.

472
00:38:18,267 --> 00:38:23,556
Better not to hear anything, say anything
and especially not to see anything.

473
00:38:40,923 --> 00:38:42,923
Nice party, eh, Gina?

474
00:38:43,056 --> 00:38:48,337
So, the new king's jester finally
condescends to speak to me.

475
00:38:48,658 --> 00:38:50,993
I haven't seen you for 3 days.

476
00:38:51,072 --> 00:38:52,056
I've no time.

477
00:38:52,133 --> 00:38:53,618
I must amuse him
all day long.

478
00:38:53,766 --> 00:38:55,766
Look how bored
he is without me.

479
00:38:55,861 --> 00:38:58,399
- You must be cautious, Kom.
- Of what?

480
00:38:58,486 --> 00:39:00,673
Don't you see that the Lankoms
all hate you?

481
00:39:00,767 --> 00:39:02,767
No Gina, I make them laugh.

482
00:39:02,861 --> 00:39:05,993
As long as I am with the king,
nothing will happen to me.

483
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:09,024
What if he gets tired of you?

484
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,376
There's no danger of that...
I've more than one trick up my sleeve.

485
00:39:11,751 --> 00:39:13,235
Come on, let's dance!

486
00:39:13,337 --> 00:39:15,102
Have you forgotten
that I'm a maid?

487
00:39:15,142 --> 00:39:16,509
I'm not allowed to dance.

488
00:39:16,602 --> 00:39:18,227
Totally stupid!

489
00:39:18,767 --> 00:39:20,767
Lankoms have some strange laws.

490
00:39:21,017 --> 00:39:24,040
Tough luck,
but I want to have fun.

491
00:39:24,744 --> 00:39:26,744
Go do your act,
but without me!

492
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,274
Here's my jester, at last.

493
00:39:34,423 --> 00:39:36,657
Time to change partners!

494
00:40:04,534 --> 00:40:07,049
Just pay attention to our business.

495
00:40:51,716 --> 00:40:53,212
What's going on?

496
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:56,540
Your Majesty, there's a fire!

497
00:40:57,236 --> 00:40:58,485
What?!

498
00:41:13,861 --> 00:41:15,524
They must be crazy!

499
00:41:15,657 --> 00:41:17,657
Glasses of wine won't put it out.

500
00:41:17,954 --> 00:41:20,508
It needs water from the lake.

501
00:41:20,833 --> 00:41:24,774
Don't say that. For us the lake water
is worse than the fire.

502
00:41:26,657 --> 00:41:28,633
If you're afraid of water
use branches...

503
00:41:29,048 --> 00:41:31,540
Beat out the fire with them,
like this.

504
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,527
Your Majesty...!

505
00:42:58,661 --> 00:43:01,152
No, I don't want to see anyone.

506
00:43:23,278 --> 00:43:24,746
What's up?

507
00:43:24,942 --> 00:43:26,387
Aren't you my friend anymore?

508
00:43:26,473 --> 00:43:28,207
Can't you see I'm working!?

509
00:43:28,911 --> 00:43:30,504
Careful, I'll get you!

510
00:43:31,231 --> 00:43:33,973
Stop it! I don't want
to play with you.

511
00:43:34,207 --> 00:43:36,082
Leave me alone...
You upset me.

512
00:43:37,067 --> 00:43:40,801
But Gina, I don't understand anymore.
You wanted me to stay a savage.

513
00:43:40,981 --> 00:43:42,488
I liked you better.

514
00:43:42,575 --> 00:43:46,553
I can't stand you being
like those baboons of the court...

515
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:48,434
...with their ridiculous ways.

516
00:43:49,614 --> 00:43:52,074
You know what you are, Gina?
Jealous.

517
00:43:52,403 --> 00:43:55,332
Me, jealous?
Of whom?

518
00:43:56,497 --> 00:43:58,497
Of me.

519
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:02,777
A simple little Wunko,
fallen from his tree...

520
00:44:02,879 --> 00:44:05,715
...who understands nothing
of anything we try to tell him.

521
00:44:06,036 --> 00:44:08,410
Gina, come back!
No Gina, don't go!

522
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,434
I don't want to see you anymore.

523
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:12,356
You can go back to your jungle.

524
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:13,645
Gina!

525
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:16,380
I don't want to see you again!

526
00:44:21,473 --> 00:44:23,035
But I love you, Gina.

527
00:44:23,971 --> 00:44:25,442
I love you.

528
00:44:46,953 --> 00:44:50,168
<i>I had forgotten my village...</i>

529
00:44:52,746 --> 00:44:55,277
<i>and the forest where I was born...</i>

530
00:44:55,371 --> 00:44:58,402
<i>to leave the sky and the clouds...</i>

531
00:45:00,981 --> 00:45:04,340
<i>I'd learned all that was needed...</i>

532
00:45:05,012 --> 00:45:08,270
<i>to be a truly civilized man</i>

533
00:45:10,167 --> 00:45:14,988
<i>Am I from above, or am I from below...</i>

534
00:45:15,411 --> 00:45:19,356
<i>I don't know where or by whom I'm wanted</i>

535
00:45:20,622 --> 00:45:24,887
<i>Why do we have to stay in this castle?</i>

536
00:45:25,786 --> 00:45:30,574
<i>Deep in me I'll always be a Wunko...</i>

537
00:45:31,051 --> 00:45:33,379
<i>away from my brothers...</i>

538
00:45:33,762 --> 00:45:41,223
<i>a loner forever between the heavens and earth</i>

539
00:46:25,669 --> 00:46:31,262
<i>Am I from above, or am I from below...</i>

540
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:36,020
<i>I don't know where or by whom I'm wanted</i>

541
00:46:36,489 --> 00:46:41,215
<i>Why do we have to stay in this castle?</i>

542
00:46:41,684 --> 00:46:46,457
<i>Deep in me I'll always be a Wunko...</i>

543
00:46:47,098 --> 00:46:49,098
<i>away from my brothers...</i>

544
00:46:49,669 --> 00:46:58,270
<i>a loner forever between the heavens and earth</i>

545
00:47:01,262 --> 00:47:03,731
Margad!

546
00:47:12,036 --> 00:47:13,551
What are you doing here?

547
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:16,613
Are you going to go up there
to join your family?

548
00:47:17,419 --> 00:47:18,949
Well, it's not that...

549
00:47:20,059 --> 00:47:21,145
Not really.

550
00:47:21,714 --> 00:47:23,020
You're a free man, Kom.

551
00:47:23,981 --> 00:47:25,238
You're not a prisoner.

552
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,731
But if you leave the castle,
I will miss you.

553
00:47:28,989 --> 00:47:30,168
No...

554
00:47:30,653 --> 00:47:31,957
I changed my mind.
I can stay a little bit longer

555
00:47:32,441 --> 00:47:34,159
I can stay a little bit longer.

556
00:47:34,723 --> 00:47:35,692
That's good.

557
00:47:36,231 --> 00:47:37,996
Where would I be,
without my jester?

558
00:47:38,192 --> 00:47:39,317
Yes, I wonder.

559
00:47:39,762 --> 00:47:42,027
What are you doing out here?
Couldn't you sleep?

560
00:47:42,286 --> 00:47:44,074
I'm having a miserable life.

561
00:47:45,372 --> 00:47:46,809
There's my daughter,
who's sick...

562
00:47:47,926 --> 00:47:50,223
...and has dreams that flare
into nightmares.

563
00:47:51,403 --> 00:47:53,762
Then there's the jealousy-fuelled plots.

564
00:47:54,067 --> 00:47:57,082
You know my people
are fearful and lazy.

565
00:47:57,575 --> 00:48:00,606
They need a noble cause
to restore their dignity.

566
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:04,387
Oh yes, I see there's something rotten
in the kingdom of the Lankoms.

567
00:48:04,911 --> 00:48:06,668
I already read that somewhere.

568
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,777
Basically, it's a castle problem.

569
00:48:08,824 --> 00:48:11,832
Why is there a need for a chamberlain,
servants, courtiers,

570
00:48:11,949 --> 00:48:13,864
a chancellor, and then the king?

571
00:48:14,208 --> 00:48:16,160
Your castle is too complicated.

572
00:48:18,411 --> 00:48:20,199
Maybe you're right...

573
00:48:21,254 --> 00:48:23,067
But what do you know
about castle politics?

574
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:26,879
If the politics are meant to make
everything work smoothly...

575
00:48:27,176 --> 00:48:29,613
...we Wunkos know much more
than you do.

576
00:48:30,059 --> 00:48:32,254
We don't do useless things
like you do.

577
00:48:32,372 --> 00:48:37,402
It's completely crazy you can't
take water to put out a fire...

578
00:48:37,801 --> 00:48:40,332
...when you have a big lake
at your disposal.

579
00:48:40,551 --> 00:48:43,762
You don't climb trees, you're proud
of your very nice clothes.

580
00:48:44,137 --> 00:48:46,137
And you're ashamed
of your ears.

581
00:48:46,255 --> 00:48:49,551
Your pal the tiger would make
a better castle politician.

582
00:48:54,075 --> 00:48:57,043
Come on you'll end up catching cold.

583
00:49:27,942 --> 00:49:30,902
People of the Lankoms...

584
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:33,270
Listen carefully!

585
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:39,270
Disgusted by the miserable spectacle
that Lankom gives them...

586
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:41,434
...in this period of decadence....

587
00:49:41,528 --> 00:49:47,559
...the gods send us this icy whiteness
from the sky, in order to warn us.

588
00:49:48,309 --> 00:49:52,973
However, our irresponsible,
morally bereft, dissolute king...

589
00:49:53,176 --> 00:49:58,379
...instead of repenting, locks himself
in the tower with his favourite.

590
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,840
Death to the jester!

591
00:50:02,442 --> 00:50:07,770
Should we still accept this drunkard,
this old libertine...

592
00:50:07,832 --> 00:50:11,505
...might I say this eccentric...
as your King?!

593
00:50:12,481 --> 00:50:14,910
No... no... no!

594
00:50:15,176 --> 00:50:17,371
So here is the solution.

595
00:50:17,489 --> 00:50:24,817
The three wise monkeys unanimously write
the official text of his abdication.

596
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:27,520
Hurray! Hurray!

597
00:50:31,496 --> 00:50:35,988
But who will govern and tell us what to do,
and what is good and bad?

598
00:50:36,278 --> 00:50:38,723
Who else but...
his daughter.

599
00:50:38,809 --> 00:50:41,574
Yes!
His daughter?!

600
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:47,490
Princess Hida, according to
our ancient laws...

601
00:50:47,809 --> 00:50:51,395
...must inherit the crown
in the case of her father's incapacity.

602
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:55,883
Of course as right now it turns out
that she is a little unwell...

603
00:50:55,908 --> 00:50:58,473
...and as I am the Grand Chancellor...

604
00:50:58,962 --> 00:51:03,626
...I see myself obliged to assume charge
of the kingdom in her place...

605
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:07,071
...for the time being, of course.

606
00:51:11,969 --> 00:51:13,492
Your Majesty...!

607
00:51:16,344 --> 00:51:17,875
Your Majesty...!

608
00:51:20,992 --> 00:51:22,031
Is that you, Kom?

609
00:51:22,078 --> 00:51:24,429
Come and see what's happening.

610
00:51:36,367 --> 00:51:37,945
Isn't it great?

611
00:51:38,024 --> 00:51:39,344
It must have fallen
all night long.

612
00:51:39,508 --> 00:51:40,937
It's amazing.

613
00:51:41,852 --> 00:51:43,945
It's the first time 
I've ever seen it.

614
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:47,015
What's it called?

615
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:50,539
It happens from time to time 
at home.

616
00:51:51,352 --> 00:51:52,773
We call it snow.

617
00:52:31,502 --> 00:52:33,868
Lankoms have always dreamt of travelling 
and making rich conquests.

618
00:52:33,975 --> 00:52:36,087
Those who claim that I am crazy...

619
00:52:36,275 --> 00:52:39,998
...and that the gods want to punish us,
are again mistaken.

620
00:52:40,647 --> 00:52:41,975
Look...

621
00:52:42,577 --> 00:52:46,975
The lake was covered with a hard coating,
so that we could cross it.

622
00:52:49,412 --> 00:52:52,514
Land we always dream of 
can now be reached.

623
00:52:52,592 --> 00:52:54,264
And I will lead you there.

624
00:52:54,944 --> 00:52:58,186
A new country...
a new empire.

625
00:52:58,513 --> 00:53:03,975
The best of you will prepare yourselves
to conquer a new world.

626
00:53:20,027 --> 00:53:22,901
I create plots and intrigues at court...

627
00:53:22,959 --> 00:53:26,209
I make sure that the king 
seems unfit to govern...

628
00:53:26,357 --> 00:53:28,607
...and his daughter unable 
to succeed him.

629
00:53:28,647 --> 00:53:32,154
I spend years waiting 
for just the right moment.

630
00:53:32,264 --> 00:53:34,646
So finally, what happens...?!

631
00:53:34,702 --> 00:53:37,553
It's the right moment 
for the king, Sire...

632
00:53:37,709 --> 00:53:41,341
He's becoming the greatest hero 
in our history.

633
00:53:41,827 --> 00:53:42,904
What?!

634
00:53:42,967 --> 00:53:46,600
Not even an earthquake would 
topple him from his throne.

635
00:53:47,374 --> 00:53:48,936
Get out!

636
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:56,186
Oh rage! Oh despair!

637
00:54:03,538 --> 00:54:04,936
That feels better!

638
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:27,818
Take a look at yourself.

639
00:54:27,959 --> 00:54:29,053
Why?

640
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:31,826
I thought I was just a dirty little Wunko, 
who understands nothing...

641
00:54:31,959 --> 00:54:33,850
...who should go home to his jungle.

642
00:54:33,944 --> 00:54:37,045
Stop it, you know what I feel for you.

643
00:54:37,913 --> 00:54:41,467
If this were a musical, 
it'd be the cue for the love duet.

644
00:54:41,975 --> 00:54:45,100
"Oh my pretty Gina..."

645
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,857
Stop that!

646
00:55:37,522 --> 00:55:39,139
What is it?

647
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,920
Sire! Sire!

648
00:55:46,475 --> 00:55:49,725
The king is headed for disaster.
He must be warned!

649
00:55:49,991 --> 00:55:53,061
Come and see... 
I'm sure I'm not mistaken.

650
00:55:53,186 --> 00:55:58,693
The ice, on which our unhappy army 
is crossing, will soon melt.

651
00:55:59,006 --> 00:56:01,389
What do you mean by "melt"?

652
00:56:01,866 --> 00:56:05,436
The ice, Sire... all the ice 
will turn into water.

653
00:56:05,521 --> 00:56:07,842
Just like that...
beneath the king and the army.

654
00:56:08,436 --> 00:56:09,506
What can we do?

655
00:56:09,577 --> 00:56:11,842
You did well to warn me.

656
00:56:12,061 --> 00:56:15,779
But it's too late now... 
They'd have gone too far.

657
00:56:15,858 --> 00:56:19,014
It is indeed very sad, Master Flavius.

658
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:22,545
Refreshing.

659
00:56:24,545 --> 00:56:28,490
For once I recognize 
that your fears can be useful.

660
00:56:28,639 --> 00:56:30,639
Sire... wait for me!

661
00:56:30,803 --> 00:56:33,639
Whatever you're doing, 
I want to be with you.

662
00:56:33,756 --> 00:56:36,756
No, I want to keep this moment 
for myself alone.

663
00:56:37,006 --> 00:56:38,576
Scram!

664
00:58:08,604 --> 00:58:10,604
Look after Ludovic!

665
00:58:16,566 --> 00:58:17,768
Help!

666
00:58:19,316 --> 00:58:20,698
Help!

667
00:58:21,191 --> 00:58:22,839
Do as I do.

668
00:58:48,259 --> 00:58:51,002
He's too far away to help.

669
00:59:01,229 --> 00:59:03,572
No, nothing can be done.

670
00:59:06,142 --> 00:59:08,399
No... nothing!

671
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:25,268
Your Highness...

672
00:59:27,307 --> 00:59:30,767
Just leave it there, and go!

673
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:58,236
To be king, to be king, to be king...

674
00:59:58,252 --> 01:00:01,306
I struggled but finally I am king

675
01:00:01,502 --> 01:00:04,697
I betrayed bribed I lied to you all, 
without respite

676
01:00:04,807 --> 01:00:09,517
But that's it, I'm born king... 
for the throne...

677
01:00:09,714 --> 01:00:14,767
For the throne we have to sacrifice all

678
01:00:14,877 --> 01:00:19,002
You can be a dog, a shark, an army of vipers

679
01:00:19,026 --> 01:00:21,111
Strike from behind to be king!

680
01:00:21,198 --> 01:00:23,478
Oh this word is the sweetest, 
it's the supreme happiness...

681
01:00:23,557 --> 01:00:28,072
The hottest thing, the cream of the cream, 
the top, the nirvana... is to be king!

682
01:00:28,744 --> 01:00:31,830
Tyrant... famous monster...

683
01:00:31,893 --> 01:00:34,775
You all are mere dwarves!

684
01:00:34,979 --> 01:00:40,681
I'll make Ivan the Terrible look like a wimp.

685
01:00:40,924 --> 01:00:46,556
I will be more cruel 
than the worst of assassins...

686
01:00:46,777 --> 01:00:54,822
I am king, I am king, I am king!

687
01:01:10,135 --> 01:01:12,291
Come back here, 
you little sticky-beak!

688
01:01:12,448 --> 01:01:15,283
You down there...
Catch her! Stop her!

689
01:01:19,612 --> 01:01:21,010
Arrest her!

690
01:01:22,029 --> 01:01:24,239
I've got to do everything!

691
01:01:25,841 --> 01:01:27,505
Out of the way!

692
01:01:32,826 --> 01:01:34,942
Master Flavius, ​​help me!

693
01:01:35,045 --> 01:01:36,661
Serignol has gone crazy.

694
01:01:36,841 --> 01:01:39,310
Oh, I know, I know!

695
01:01:39,727 --> 01:01:41,727
I'll catch her!

696
01:02:21,931 --> 01:02:23,494
Come on, Ludo.

697
01:02:23,690 --> 01:02:25,947
We're nearly there... Hold on!

698
01:02:29,331 --> 01:02:30,486
Kom!

699
01:02:31,573 --> 01:02:33,791
It's you...!
Where are the others?

700
01:02:34,994 --> 01:02:36,088
Gina...

701
01:02:36,612 --> 01:02:38,369
We're the only ones...

702
01:02:38,478 --> 01:02:39,991
I can scarcely believe it...

703
01:02:40,119 --> 01:02:42,455
The king and everyone else 
is dead.

704
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:47,525
That's what I thought when I saw Serignol 
dancing with the crown on his head.

705
01:02:48,299 --> 01:02:51,307
We must protect the princess 
before it's too late.

706
01:02:51,471 --> 01:02:53,158
Both of you come with me.

707
01:03:10,159 --> 01:03:12,838
Look up there!

708
01:03:13,315 --> 01:03:15,908
The demon! Up there! Up there!

709
01:03:16,487 --> 01:03:20,408
That demon is the cause 
of all our misfortune.

710
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:25,666
He alone survived the disaster, 
thanks to his evil wizardry.

711
01:03:26,283 --> 01:03:28,041
Now he taunts us.

712
01:03:30,541 --> 01:03:32,142
The jester must die!

713
01:03:33,737 --> 01:03:35,737
- They've taken control of the princess.
- What do you mean?

714
01:03:36,111 --> 01:03:40,525
This is what they poison her with.
It's not the soup I gave her.

715
01:03:43,017 --> 01:03:47,469
That's the poison from the petals 
that the housekeeper picked.

716
01:03:47,791 --> 01:03:48,744
What?

717
01:03:50,697 --> 01:03:52,510
I know where these flowers come from.

718
01:03:52,651 --> 01:03:54,072
What do you mean?

719
01:03:54,104 --> 01:03:56,104
Quick... hurry, they're coming.

720
01:03:56,557 --> 01:03:58,346
We must save her.

721
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:00,197
Wait, I remember!

722
01:04:00,518 --> 01:04:02,775
The world is like these blue flowers...

723
01:04:03,081 --> 01:04:05,346
Up is good.
Down is bad.

724
01:04:05,424 --> 01:04:06,447
That's it!

725
01:04:06,534 --> 01:04:09,057
I know how to find the remedy.

726
01:04:09,713 --> 01:04:12,111
You and Ludo look for the princess 
and make sure of her.

727
01:04:12,261 --> 01:04:13,642
Alright, but be quick.

728
01:04:16,252 --> 01:04:17,713
Catch him!

729
01:04:22,237 --> 01:04:23,728
There he is!

730
01:05:37,527 --> 01:05:38,565
Kom?

731
01:05:44,541 --> 01:05:47,003
Margad!

732
01:05:49,322 --> 01:05:50,901
That sounds like...

733
01:05:59,144 --> 01:06:00,681
Kom!

734
01:06:10,839 --> 01:06:12,941
It's really you!

735
01:06:13,386 --> 01:06:14,831
I knew you were alive.

736
01:06:15,144 --> 01:06:16,901
How about Mum...
Is she OK?

737
01:06:17,136 --> 01:06:19,737
It's weird...
At first she said you were dead...

738
01:06:19,846 --> 01:06:24,588
I don't know why, but all of a sudden 
this morning, she guessed you were back.

739
01:06:25,238 --> 01:06:27,456
But what's this thing?

740
01:06:27,558 --> 01:06:30,214
It's called clothing.
I'll explain later.

741
01:06:30,385 --> 01:06:32,479
Aren't you coming home?

742
01:06:32,543 --> 01:06:35,206
No, Margad, I don't have time.

743
01:06:35,363 --> 01:06:38,073
You just tell Mum 
I'm alive and well.

744
01:06:38,285 --> 01:06:40,285
Will you come back some day?

745
01:06:40,605 --> 01:06:42,605
I know the way now.

746
01:06:59,910 --> 01:07:02,167
We do not need the princess 
anymore now.

747
01:07:02,988 --> 01:07:05,464
I put all the poison in this cup.

748
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:07,269
The people will be unhappy.

749
01:07:07,401 --> 01:07:09,371
No doubt dear friend.

750
01:07:09,496 --> 01:07:11,995
But the people
love big funerals.

751
01:07:12,284 --> 01:07:14,487
I'll break the
sad news myself...

752
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:16,356
...after my coronation.

753
01:07:17,956 --> 01:07:19,909
Why does he still keep 
this stupid bird?

754
01:07:20,691 --> 01:07:24,105
For the last time Highness...

755
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:30,187
Drink, my dear!

756
01:07:34,657 --> 01:07:38,359
That's a good girl...
Drink it all up, Housekeeper!

757
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:40,555
Every last drop!

758
01:07:40,844 --> 01:07:43,039
She is not in danger of dying.

759
01:07:43,516 --> 01:07:45,254
No,
but it may sleep a long time.

760
01:07:45,351 --> 01:07:49,813
I'd be very surprised if a Prince Charming 
came to wake her up.

761
01:07:52,165 --> 01:07:55,976
I hope Kom found what he was looking for 
and will be back in time.

762
01:08:31,932 --> 01:08:34,705
Liar! Vulture! Traitor!

763
01:08:35,869 --> 01:08:37,869
It's the Devil!

764
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:41,876
Guards, disembowel him 
once and for all!

765
01:08:46,072 --> 01:08:47,759
Kom is right about Serignole.

766
01:08:48,049 --> 01:08:49,384
You are a traitor.

767
01:08:50,369 --> 01:08:54,947
But your plot failed, thanks to Gina 
and her friend Kom.

768
01:08:55,595 --> 01:08:59,299
I proclaim that I am healed 
and ready to reign.

769
01:08:59,651 --> 01:09:02,056
Long live the Queen!

770
01:10:08,875 --> 01:10:11,179
1.. 2... 3...

771
01:10:12,351 --> 01:10:14,296
No! Not the labyrinth!

772
01:10:22,328 --> 01:10:24,328
Now that I'm thinking properly again...

773
01:10:24,609 --> 01:10:26,944
...I would like proper thinking 
to rule this castle.

774
01:10:27,319 --> 01:10:30,093
I was deprived of my will,
but nothing escaped me....

775
01:10:30,382 --> 01:10:33,171
...and I thought about 
what we could do together.

776
01:10:33,539 --> 01:10:37,616
We must give up the idea of ​​a better world 
on the other side of the lake.

777
01:10:38,414 --> 01:10:42,351
The land of the monkeys
is here on this shore.

778
01:10:42,515 --> 01:10:45,124
And that is the land 
we must make better...

779
01:10:45,359 --> 01:10:49,241
...by banishing ignorance 
and superstition forever.

780
01:10:50,507 --> 01:10:52,507
We were afraid of the Wunkos...

781
01:10:52,835 --> 01:10:55,757
...yet it is a brave Wunko 
to whom I owe my life.

782
01:10:57,656 --> 01:11:00,905
Wunkos and Lankom 
share the same ancestry.

783
01:11:01,211 --> 01:11:03,788
It is only time that has separated us.

784
01:11:05,194 --> 01:11:11,452
Now we must learn about, and get to know
each other, for the sake of all monkeys.

785
01:11:14,404 --> 01:11:19,654
You uttered the cry for "sermon" and I repeat,
that everything UP is good...

786
01:11:19,968 --> 01:11:23,671
...and everything DOWN is bad.

787
01:11:24,015 --> 01:11:24,851
Look!

788
01:11:24,876 --> 01:11:26,562
Silence, you insolent brats!

789
01:11:26,679 --> 01:11:28,507
Where are you going?

790
01:11:28,554 --> 01:11:30,163
The lesson's not over!

791
01:11:30,195 --> 01:11:32,109
Come back immediately!

792
01:11:32,187 --> 01:11:35,194
You'll all be punished!
Come back here!

793
01:11:44,506 --> 01:11:46,226
Look... Kom has come back...

794
01:11:47,054 --> 01:11:48,842
There he is!

795
01:12:19,885 --> 01:12:21,885
He's been successful!

796
01:12:43,945 --> 01:12:46,482
