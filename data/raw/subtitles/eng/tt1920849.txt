00:06:33,573 --> 00:06:35,267
I can't believe you
get paid for this,

182
00:06:35,268 --> 00:06:36,550
and I'm just a good friend.

183
00:06:38,468 --> 00:06:39,460
(Gena)

184
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:40,262
about blowjobs,

185
00:06:41,221 --> 00:06:42,181
if you want to hear it.

186
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,579
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.

187
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,253
Yeah?

188
00:06:45,253 --> 00:06:45,253
It's very interesting.

189
00:06:45,956 --> 00:06:47,108
All right.

190
00:06:47,109 --> 00:06:48,163
I-I personally think
that blowjobs are

191
00:06:48,164 --> 00:06:49,409
an extremely delicate thing.

192
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,721
You know, like if you're..

193
00:06:50,722 --> 00:06:51,841
if you're ranking them
on a scale of 1 to 10,

194
00:06:51,842 --> 00:06:53,250
1 being I'm blowing it kisses

195
00:06:53,251 --> 00:06:56,386
and 10 being I'm, you know,
choking on just semen,

196
00:06:56,387 --> 00:06:59,202
vomit just everywhere.

197
00:06:59,203 --> 00:07:03,074
I think you gotta start
off with 4s and with 5s.

198
00:07:03,075 --> 00:07:05,762
Like just enough so the...
so that you know that

199
00:07:05,763 --> 00:07:07,362
I know exactly what I'm doing,

200
00:07:07,363 --> 00:07:09,123
but with zero enthusiasm.

201
00:07:09,123 --> 00:07:11,073
I'm giving you nothing,

202
00:07:11,074 --> 00:07:12,448
because then you're
gonna be like

203
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:14,081
all right, fine. I'll
just fuck her, you know?

204
00:07:14,082 --> 00:07:16,001
'Cause if I start off with
a 10, I got nowhere to go.

205
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:17,921
I mean, why are you gonna
spend any time fucking me?

206
00:07:17,922 --> 00:07:19,136
You just came all over my face.

207
00:07:19,137 --> 00:07:19,713
So you start off small, right?

208
00:07:19,714 --> 00:07:20,577
But you build.

209
00:07:20,578 --> 00:07:21,634
I'll give you a 6

210
00:07:21,635 --> 00:07:24,161
after a fight, when
we're making up.

211
00:07:24,162 --> 00:07:25,506
And then an 8

212
00:07:25,507 --> 00:07:27,425
when you spend a
shitload of money on me,

213
00:07:27,426 --> 00:07:29,857
or get me something
that's like a sweet...

214
00:07:29,858 --> 00:07:32,225
gift or whatever,
I'll do full 8.

215
00:07:32,226 --> 00:07:34,465
But then, I circle it back.

216
00:07:34,466 --> 00:07:37,920
Back to the 3s, the 4s, and
the 5s, because that shit,

217
00:07:37,921 --> 00:07:39,266
every time, without fail,

218
00:07:39,266 --> 00:07:41,473
makes the guy's
dick alarm go off.

219
00:07:41,474 --> 00:07:43,682
You know what I mean
when I say dick alarm.

220
00:07:44,514 --> 00:07:45,664
Right?

221
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:47,007
And you're gonna be like,

222
00:07:47,007 --> 00:07:47,650
"Hey, baby.
What's wrong with you?

223
00:07:47,651 --> 00:07:48,897
You're acting funny.

224
00:07:48,898 --> 00:07:50,113
Why so sad?"

225
00:07:50,114 --> 00:07:51,999
When really what you're
telling me is, "God dammit,

226
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,283
just like suck
my dick harder."

227
00:07:55,201 --> 00:08:00,863
So... um... let's just
say um, like, what...

228
00:08:00,864 --> 00:08:02,624
what would merit a 10?

229
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:03,455
What's an example?

230
00:08:03,456 --> 00:08:05,568
I don't know,
you're like on a...

231
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:10,015
on an airplane, you're going
to a wedding of this girl

232
00:08:10,016 --> 00:08:11,902
that you went to
high school with.

233
00:08:11,903 --> 00:08:12,576
Uh, two more?

234
00:08:12,577 --> 00:08:14,046
(stewardess) Sure.

235
00:08:14,047 --> 00:08:16,959
And your ex-boyfriend uh...
[LAUGH]

236
00:08:17,087 --> 00:08:19,711
Your ex-boyfriend who
ruined your fucking life

237
00:08:19,712 --> 00:08:20,831
is gonna be there.

238
00:08:20,832 --> 00:08:21,791
That jerk.

239
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,541
All this pent-up
frustration,

240
00:08:24,542 --> 00:08:27,421
sitting next to some dude
you're never gonna see again.

241
00:08:27,422 --> 00:08:28,669
That would warrant a 10.

242
00:08:29,631 --> 00:08:35,006
[CLEARS THROAT] Well...
How about this guy?

243
00:08:35,007 --> 00:08:38,238
Oh, no. I feel like I'll
definitely see you again.

244
00:08:50,782 --> 00:08:52,414
[GENA LAUGH]

245
00:08:52,415 --> 00:08:53,886
(Gena) Oh, my goodness.

246
00:08:53,887 --> 00:08:54,684
Bee!

247
00:08:54,685 --> 00:08:55,645
Look at her!

248
00:08:55,646 --> 00:08:56,765
Bee-Face.

249
00:08:56,765 --> 00:08:57,980
(Regan) Aw, Bees!

250
00:08:57,981 --> 00:08:58,971
(Katie) We're together again!

251
00:08:58,972 --> 00:08:59,327
Everything's okay, you guys.

252
00:09:00,286 --> 00:09:01,309
All right.

253
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:03,229
How are we gonna get through
the next twelve hours?

254
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,477
Gena brought cocaine!

255
00:09:04,478 --> 00:09:05,054
Oh, my god.

256
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:09,211
Let's use our indoor voices, about it...
you know...

257
00:09:09,212 --> 00:09:10,203
Here's the deal, though.

258
00:09:10,204 --> 00:09:12,155
We need to do some before
the bachelorette party.

259
00:09:12,156 --> 00:09:13,980
Uh, it's not that
kind of a party.

260
00:09:13,981 --> 00:09:15,452
Hear me out.

261
00:09:15,453 --> 00:09:18,171
We don't want to share our
coke with rando bridesmaids.

262
00:09:18,172 --> 00:09:19,164
It's for us.

263
00:09:19,165 --> 00:09:20,091
It's true.

264
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:21,052

Bee-yatch-faces!

265
00:09:21,053 --> 00:09:24,187
Ah-hah!

Woo!
[LAUGH]

267
00:09:27,836 --> 00:09:30,843
I'm so excited, I
could buy a gun.

268
00:09:30,844 --> 00:09:34,491
You guys are all
here, at my wedding.

269
00:09:34,492 --> 00:09:37,050
Me... Isn't it just crazy?

270
00:09:37,051 --> 00:09:39,513
Did Regan tell you guys
just how excited I am?

271
00:09:39,514 --> 00:09:40,507
Yeah.

272
00:09:40,508 --> 00:09:40,541
I see Regan all the time.

273
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:41,500
I'm sick of her.

274
00:09:42,394 --> 00:09:43,323
Yeah.
Feeling's mutual.

275
00:09:43,324 --> 00:09:45,081
I'm so sick of you.

276
00:09:45,082 --> 00:09:46,332
I'm sick of you, too.

277
00:09:47,258 --> 00:09:48,282
There's my sick, running
down your shoulder.

278
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,106
Yuck!

279
00:09:50,107 --> 00:09:52,188
You are the first
Bee-Face to get married.

280
00:09:53,146 --> 00:09:54,142
Oh.

281
00:09:57,019 --> 00:09:57,977
I'm gonna cry.

282
00:09:57,978 --> 00:10:00,569
No, don't cry, 'cause
then I will cry too.

283
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,009
Like when we all watched

284
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,673
Princess Di's funeral
together, you remember that?

285
00:10:03,674 --> 00:10:04,792
Too soon.

286
00:10:04,793 --> 00:10:06,298
That was like fifteen
years ago, pal.

287
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:08,250
Uh, that was like
four years ago.

288
00:10:08,251 --> 00:10:10,104
It was fifteen
years ago, Katie.

289
00:10:10,105 --> 00:10:11,577
It was five years ago.

290
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:12,187
I think I know
when Lady Diana died.

291
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:15,513
Did Regan explain to you
about the par-tay tonight?

292
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:17,817
I was just trying to
tell them that, yes...

293
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:19,768
Well, okay. It's a little
last-minute,

294
00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:24,153
but... We are having champagne...
(Katie) Ooh!

295
00:10:24,154 --> 00:10:25,591
(Becky)
...and ice cream,

296
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:27,927
in our suite after
the rehearsal dinner.

297
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:28,951
(Katie) Great!

298
00:10:28,952 --> 00:10:30,649
And then we're gonna
like, party, right?

299
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,537
Like ah... like woo!

300
00:10:32,538 --> 00:10:35,479
[SNORTS] Like mm... Oh.

301
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,344
I know.

302
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:37,944
Yeah, boring.

303
00:10:37,945 --> 00:10:38,521
(Becky) Right.

304
00:10:38,522 --> 00:10:41,367
Old, boring, almost-married
lady right here.

305
00:10:41,367 --> 00:10:44,888
Yeah, it's just that uh,
a lot of the bridesmaids

306
00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:46,135
came from out of town,

307
00:10:46,136 --> 00:10:48,535
so I just had to keep
it really low-key.

308
00:10:48,536 --> 00:10:51,318
And besides, I'm not a
big partier anymore.

309
00:10:51,319 --> 00:10:52,825
Not like some people.

310
00:10:53,784 --> 00:10:55,415
These two.

311
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,590
So... all right, well... I
think our car is waiting,

312
00:10:57,591 --> 00:10:58,486
so let's all go.

313
00:10:58,487 --> 00:10:59,510
Oh. Let's go.

314
00:10:59,511 --> 00:11:04,727
Byeee... We're totally gonna
keep it low-key, too.

315
00:11:04,728 --> 00:11:06,005
That's what we
were talking about.

316
00:11:06,006 --> 00:11:07,287
Just keeping
it low-key.

317
00:11:07,288 --> 00:11:09,240
That's the kind
of girls we are.

318
00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:11,415
Let's do some coke.

319
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:12,502
Yes!

320
00:11:12,503 --> 00:11:19,348


321
00:11:19,349 --> 00:11:19,349
(Gena) Look at these people,

322
00:11:20,118 --> 00:11:22,934
just desperate,
terrible, all of them.

323
00:11:22,935 --> 00:11:25,300
They want to be like, in
what, legalized slavery?

324
00:11:25,301 --> 00:11:26,517
That's what it is,

325
00:11:26,518 --> 00:11:28,214
it's like a Jane
Austen novel on crack.

326
00:11:28,215 --> 00:11:29,781
That's exactly right.

327
00:11:29,782 --> 00:11:30,902
Should we do some more coke?

328
00:11:31,798 --> 00:11:31,798
If you do anymore coke,

329
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,452
somebody's dick is
gonna get sucked.

330
00:11:34,453 --> 00:11:41,557
Oh...

331
00:11:41,558 --> 00:11:43,125
Here we go.

332
00:11:43,126 --> 00:11:45,043
To you and your
beautiful daughter.

333
00:11:45,044 --> 00:11:45,652
Yes, indeed.

00:11:45,653 --> 00:11:47,029
(Regan) Victoria,

335
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,274
are you feeling
confident about tomorrow?

336
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:49,940
Your walk down the aisle
was a little bumpy.

337
00:11:49,941 --> 00:11:50,899
Was it bumpy?

338
00:11:50,964 --> 00:11:50,965
I don't remember it being bumpy.

339
00:11:51,924 --> 00:11:51,924
Are you kidding?
Best man,

340
00:11:52,789 --> 00:11:53,650
mother of the bride?

341
00:11:53,651 --> 00:11:55,795
We got this on lockdown,
don't we, Victoria?

342
00:11:55,796 --> 00:11:57,076
He's handsome and funny.

343
00:11:57,077 --> 00:11:58,164
(Victoria)
Are you married, Trevor?

344
00:11:58,165 --> 00:11:59,764
No.

345
00:11:59,765 --> 00:12:00,625
Oh. Yeah. No, no.

346
00:12:00,626 --> 00:12:01,585
I'm trying, though.

347
00:12:01,586 --> 00:12:02,642
I'm just, you know...

348
00:12:02,643 --> 00:12:03,636
haven't found the
right girl yet.

349
00:12:03,637 --> 00:12:04,946
Hey.

350
00:12:04,947 --> 00:12:05,588
You know how Becky
wanted to keep it low-key?

351
00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:09,459
Well... I got a stripper for
the bachelorette party.

352
00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:10,452
Stop your lies.

353
00:12:10,453 --> 00:12:13,011
You don't know any strippers.

354
00:12:13,012 --> 00:12:14,066
I do.

355
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,883
I know a freelance stripper.

356
00:12:16,884 --> 00:12:18,358
That sounds amazing.

357
00:12:20,276 --> 00:12:22,866


358
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:23,699

359

361
00:12:48,082 --> 00:12:50,705
(Katie) I just don't know...
how to do it.

362
00:12:50,706 --> 00:12:53,265
Like in a bathtub,
with rope... I just

363
00:12:53,266 --> 00:12:54,129
I gotta go do something.

364
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:55,184
Okay.

365
00:12:55,185 --> 00:12:56,241
Please don't leave me alone.

366
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:58,258
Now honey, why can't you
find a nice man like this?

367
00:12:58,258 --> 00:12:58,258
Hmm?

368
00:12:58,992 --> 00:13:00,144
Oh, come on.

369
00:13:00,145 --> 00:13:01,041
Frank is never
gonna commit to you.

370
00:13:01,042 --> 00:13:02,832
Frank?
Who's Frank?

371
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:03,823
(Victoria) Her boyfriend.

372
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:04,943
He's doing his residency.

373
00:13:04,944 --> 00:13:06,063
He'll be here tomorrow.

374
00:13:06,064 --> 00:13:06,959
Yeah... Wow.

375
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,887
I bet he's busy a lot.

376
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:09,102
Tough to commit that way.

377
00:13:09,103 --> 00:13:10,065
Let's just say
hi to Aunt Janey, okay?

378
00:13:10,066 --> 00:13:11,759
You don't want to be rude.

379

I'll be right here.

380
00:13:18,481 --> 00:13:19,376
(Bartender)
Can I get you anything?

381
00:13:19,377 --> 00:13:21,135

385
00:13:31,631 --> 00:13:33,967
From back in the...
we went to...

Do you...?

Do you have a job?

A job?
Like out- like a...

389
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,604
yeah, I have a job um,
uh, in the world.

390

computer programming, actually.

391
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,646
Like a Steve Jobs
kind of thing?

392
00:13:41,647 --> 00:13:44,365
Uh, hmm, kind- err, no.

393

Not at all, actually.

You don't remember me, do you?

396
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:50,380
Ah... The honeymoon
is a total surprise.

397
00:13:50,381 --> 00:13:53,037
I haven't told her yet, but
I'm gonna blow her mind.

398

399
00:13:54,061 --> 00:13:55,055
We're going to central Germany.

400
00:13:55,056 --> 00:13:57,810
It's incredible. We should...
Gena?

401
00:14:02,605 --> 00:14:03,310
Hi...

402
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:05,262
Hi, Clyde.

403
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:08,717
I haven't seen you since...
...that thing.

404
00:14:08,718 --> 00:14:11,565
...since that thing I
grew up next to Becky,

405
00:14:11,566 --> 00:14:14,285
so I was kind of around a lot.

406
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:15,083
We would hang out
a little bit, and then

407
00:14:15,084 --> 00:14:17,038
into high school, we were
in French class together.

408
00:14:17,038 --> 00:14:17,038
Wait.
I took French?

409
00:14:17,645 --> 00:14:18,250
Yes.

410
00:14:18,251 --> 00:14:19,790
You actually used to
copy my homework.

411
00:14:20,749 --> 00:14:22,092
But no,
it's-it's good.

412
00:14:22,093 --> 00:14:24,844

and uh...

I-I sold you pot.

415
00:14:27,756 --> 00:14:30,764
Oh, Joe!

416
00:14:30,765 --> 00:14:31,755
That's-that's me.

Yeah, new bangs.

Do you have some?

420
00:14:35,532 --> 00:14:37,389
Remember how I was telling you
about the Bee-Faces,

421
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,635

This is Gena Myers,
she's one of them.

Oh, hi.

00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:42,987
Gena, this is my
sister, Stefanie.

425
00:14:42,988 --> 00:14:44,586
Nice to meet you,

Oh, no.
I'm not married.

427
00:14:45,837 --> 00:14:48,970
And um, I'm not an
adult, either, so...

428

getting restless.

00:14:51,564 --> 00:14:55,658
Oh... You two know each other from...
...high school.

431
00:14:55,659 --> 00:14:56,905
...since I was your age.

432
00:14:59,884 --> 00:15:02,250
All right. I'm gonna go
sit down, but um... Okay.

00:15:02,251 --> 00:15:03,178
...will you come
sit next to me?

What?

437
00:15:12,394 --> 00:15:13,481
I didn't say anything.

438
00:15:13,482 --> 00:15:15,977
That is a... dress?

439
00:15:15,978 --> 00:15:17,610
No, this is a T-shirt.

440
00:15:17,611 --> 00:15:20,169
I'm glad to see you're still
fighting the good fight

441

against the tyranny of pants.

442
00:15:21,098 --> 00:15:22,216
I also thought maybe

443
00:15:22,217 --> 00:15:23,655
this would help you
get a head-start.

444
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:25,418
Maybe I'm looking
for a challenge.

00:15:39,241 --> 00:15:40,231
Okay.

451
00:15:40,232 --> 00:15:41,383
Our seventh-grade field trip

00:15:41,384 --> 00:15:42,599
to Six Flags is
coming to a close.

We're all piling on
the bus to go home.

454
00:15:43,786 --> 00:15:45,448
Dale lags behind,

455
00:15:45,449 --> 00:15:47,305
'cause he just has
to ride the Freefall

456
00:15:47,306 --> 00:15:48,616
at the last minute.

457
00:15:48,617 --> 00:15:50,121
So he's running like
hell to catch up to us,

458
00:15:50,121 --> 00:15:51,783
and he just bites it.

459
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,888
Wipes out completely, spills
what must be two liters

460
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:57,000
of Dr. Pepper all over his
shorts, [GUEST LAUGHTER]

461
00:15:57,001 --> 00:15:58,087
just epic.

462
00:15:58,088 --> 00:16:00,613
So later, he and I are sitting
in the back of the bus,

463
00:16:00,614 --> 00:16:04,647
and I get a whiff of
Dr. Pepper and piss.

464
00:16:04,648 --> 00:16:07,303
And I say, "You know,
it'd be pretty funny

465
00:16:07,304 --> 00:16:10,918
if you pissed your
pants riding Freefall,

466
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:12,616
and then spilled Dr. Pepper
all over yourself

467
00:16:12,617 --> 00:16:14,855
to try, cover it up."

468
00:16:14,856 --> 00:16:17,991

goes, "Yes, it would be.

be kinda genius.

What happened?

560
00:20:01,915 --> 00:20:04,666
Why would he say that?

561
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:08,218
(Gena) Because... because
it was just a j-... I mean,

he was joking around, you know.

You guys should both get in it,

631
00:22:28,275 --> 00:22:29,810
and then I'll take a picture
and put it on Facebook.

632
00:22:29,811 --> 00:22:30,803

00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:35,218

No, we're not.

It's okay.

She can still wear it.

658
00:23:12,465 --> 00:23:12,977
It's not okay.

659
00:23:13,778 --> 00:23:14,768
that's unfixable!

660
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:16,400
We're fucked!

661
00:23:16,401 --> 00:23:17,648
Okay. We- you know what?

662
00:23:17,649 --> 00:23:19,184
We're just gonna hide it.

663
00:23:19,185 --> 00:23:20,498
We're gonna have to make it
look as if somebody just,

664
00:23:21,457 --> 00:23:22,510
you know, they broke
in and they stole it.

665
00:23:22,511 --> 00:23:24,430
(Gena) No... We're
gonna make it look

666
00:23:24,431 --> 00:23:25,454
as if the place is ransacked.

667
00:23:25,455 --> 00:23:26,353
(Regan) What are you doing?

668
00:23:26,354 --> 00:23:27,728

We need to fix this.

676
00:23:36,722 --> 00:23:37,871
All right?

677
00:23:37,872 --> 00:23:37,872
I thought you said
that was unfixable?

678
00:23:38,545 --> 00:23:40,880
Well... I have done so much coke

679
00:23:40,881 --> 00:23:42,351
that I should be dead, okay?

680
00:23:42,352 --> 00:23:44,016
I should have died
like ten minutes ago,

681
00:23:44,017 --> 00:23:46,575
so perhaps we should get a
second opinion.

682
00:23:46,576 --> 00:23:47,950
(Gena) This is an emergency.

683
00:23:47,951 --> 00:23:48,877
(Katie) It's an emergency.

684
00:23:48,878 --> 00:23:49,838
(Gena) An emergency.

685
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:51,759
(Cleaner) I'm sorry,
but I can't help you.

686
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,069
Well, what are we
paying you for?

687
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,192
We're not paying her, Katie.

688
00:23:54,193 --> 00:23:55,597
Somebody is paying her.

689
00:23:55,598 --> 00:23:56,526
(Gena) That's true.

690
00:23:56,527 --> 00:23:57,100
Somebody is paying you.

691
00:23:57,101 --> 00:23:58,189
Woo! Not enough.

692
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:00,334
(Katie) You're supposed to
help the guests of the hotel

693
00:24:00,335 --> 00:24:01,486
(Gena) Are you a volunteer?

694
00:24:01,487 --> 00:24:02,573
What kind of false
economy is this?

695
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:03,727
Are y'all high?

696
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,614
Come over here.

697
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:06,511
(Gena) Yeah.

698
00:24:07,407 --> 00:24:09,422
I don't think she speaks
English that well.

699
00:24:09,423 --> 00:24:12,046
You're not coming
to the wedding?

700
00:24:12,047 --> 00:24:13,357
Oh, my god.

701
00:24:13,358 --> 00:24:14,958
Your residency,
my ass, Fuckface!

702
00:24:14,959 --> 00:24:16,908
You knew about this for months!

703
00:24:16,909 --> 00:24:17,836
Shit is going down!

704
00:24:17,837 --> 00:24:18,608
I need you here.

705
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:23,917
Frank... Frank... Frank...

706
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:25,740
Regan!

707
00:24:25,741 --> 00:24:26,987
We have a bit
of a catastrophe here.

708
00:24:26,988 --> 00:24:28,749
You wanna help us fix
the fucking dress?

709
00:24:28,749 --> 00:24:28,749
How's Frank?

710
00:24:29,485 --> 00:24:30,288
Fuck Frank!

711
00:24:33,165 --> 00:24:35,916
Okay... please?

712
00:24:35,917 --> 00:24:37,421
There's gotta be
something you can do here.

713
00:24:37,422 --> 00:24:41,101
This is housekeeping, not
Project Runway.

714
00:24:41,102 --> 00:24:42,635
You need a tailor.

715
00:24:42,636 --> 00:24:44,652
Tailors don't work
in the middle of the night.

716
00:24:44,653 --> 00:24:45,962
Okay. Girlfriend to girlfriend,

717
00:24:45,963 --> 00:24:47,819
you gotta be able
to work this out. Come on.

718

brilliant plan, you know?

it's a little on the nose

that I'm going to strip club

the night before my wedding,

760

but you know, I'm fine with it

of the deal, Trevor.

00:29:28,414 --> 00:29:29,981
she didn't want
to wear her dress.

900
00:29:29,982 --> 00:29:30,940
I'm sorry.

901
00:29:30,941 --> 00:29:32,091
I was just in my brain,

902
00:29:32,092 --> 00:29:32,575
and I was just
really hurting you.

903
00:29:33,534 --> 00:29:34,908
What did you just say?

904
00:29:34,909 --> 00:29:36,673
(Gena)
Ba-bam!

905
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:41,597
If I am still working in retail

906
00:29:41,598 --> 00:29:44,700
by the time I'm 40,
I will kill myself.

907
00:29:44,701 --> 00:29:48,091
I know you guys think I'm
joking, but I'm not.

908
00:29:48,092 --> 00:29:51,034
I will take a shotgun,
and I will blow...

909
00:29:51,035 --> 00:29:51,836
(Gena)
Woman... chillax.

910
00:29:51,836 --> 00:29:51,836
my... head off.

911
00:29:52,637 --> 00:29:53,309
(Gena) Please.

912
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,556
Seriously, you guys.

913
00:29:54,557 --> 00:29:55,643
Okay.

914
00:29:55,644 --> 00:29:56,795
All right.

915
00:29:56,796 --> 00:29:57,725
Fun, fun, fun.

916
00:29:57,726 --> 00:29:59,002
(Katie) Oh!

917
00:29:59,003 --> 00:30:01,341
This is all I have,

918
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,699
and it's still a
size too small.

919
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,755
Is this pretty?

920
00:30:05,756 --> 00:30:06,650
Or is it ugly?

921
00:30:06,651 --> 00:30:07,579
(Katie) It's gorgeous.

922
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,730
It's the dress you wanted

923
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:10,906
to get married in, ever since
you were a little girl

924
00:30:10,907 --> 00:30:11,612
I mean, it would look
so much better on you,

925
00:30:11,613 --> 00:30:12,954
but it's gorgeous!

926
00:30:12,955 --> 00:30:14,012
Everyone wants this cut.

927
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:14,012
I mean, not in this size,

928
00:30:14,748 --> 00:30:15,675
obviously.

929
00:30:15,676 --> 00:30:16,347
But this is so popular.

930
00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:17,850
Everybody wants it.

931
00:30:17,851 --> 00:30:18,809
(Regan) No.

932
00:30:17,851 --> 00:30:19,034
(Gena)
Okay, we want it. Yeah.

933
00:30:19,035 --> 00:30:20,121
(Gen(Regan)
WrapNo. up!

934
00:30:20,122 --> 00:30:20,763
(Gena)
Wrap it up. Hang it up.

935
00:30:20,763 --> 00:30:20,763
Pigface!

936
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:22,011
No!

937
00:30:22,012 --> 00:30:23,102
Over my dead body.

938
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:25,881
Regan!

939
00:30:25,882 --> 00:30:26,745
Bee!

940
00:30:26,746 --> 00:30:27,834
What the fuck?

941
00:30:27,835 --> 00:30:29,370
Come on, that was our solution!

942
00:30:29,371 --> 00:30:32,121
This is the problem... Becky
can't wear that dress!

943
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:33,050
Becky can't wear that dress.

944
00:30:33,051 --> 00:30:34,073
What? Okay,
listen to me.

945
00:30:34,074 --> 00:30:35,163
This is clearly like some girl

946
00:30:35,164 --> 00:30:36,602
shit that I don't understand,

947
00:30:36,826 --> 00:30:38,970
so may I just be very,
very diplomatic

948
00:30:38,971 --> 00:30:40,761
and say let it fucking go?

949
00:30:40,762 --> 00:30:41,882
No!

950
00:30:41,883 --> 00:30:43,321
I'm not gonna
watch Becky Archer

951
00:30:43,547 --> 00:30:46,041
walk down the aisle
in my dream dress.

952
00:30:46,042 --> 00:30:47,418
I'd rather lick this sidewalk.

953
00:30:47,419 --> 00:30:48,472
Great!

954
00:30:48,473 --> 00:30:49,816
Lick the sidewalk,
then, please.

955
00:30:49,817 --> 00:30:50,777
I'm gonna lick it, too.

956
00:30:49,818 --> 00:30:51,193
Don't be ridiculous.

957
00:30:51,194 --> 00:30:52,154
You don't lick the sidewalk.

958
00:30:52,155 --> 00:30:54,171
You lick the sidewalk,
I'll let it go.

959
00:30:56,089 --> 00:30:56,089
A little lick.

960
00:30:56,697 --> 00:30:57,657
Like a cat lick.

961
00:30:57,658 --> 00:30:59,330
Like a cat lick.

962
00:31:07,002 --> 00:31:07,864
Ugh.

963
00:31:07,865 --> 00:31:09,495
(Gena) Be encouraging.

964
00:31:09,496 --> 00:31:11,097
I'm mentally preparing myself.

965
00:31:11,098 --> 00:31:13,431
(Gena) Just do it fast, please.

966
00:31:13,432 --> 00:31:14,425
Like you're ripping
off a Band-Aid

967
00:31:14,426 --> 00:31:15,864
(Gena) Like anal sex.

968
00:31:15,865 --> 00:31:17,497
(Katie)
Becky can't wear that dress.

969
00:31:17,498 --> 00:31:20,088
A-a biased cut would
look awful on her.

970
00:31:20,089 --> 00:31:21,366
It utilizes the
stretch of the fabric

971
00:31:21,367 --> 00:31:23,609
in a diagonal direction,
accentuating body lines.

972
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:27,386
It would fit her like a silk
stuffed sausage casing.

973
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:31,192
Rain man?

974
00:31:32,151 --> 00:31:34,902
How did you know all
that stuff, just now?

975
00:31:34,903 --> 00:31:36,346
I spent a semester at F.I.T.

976
00:31:38,264 --> 00:31:39,223
Katie? Katie?

977
00:31:38,264 --> 00:31:39,895
Yes?

978
00:31:39,896 --> 00:31:41,847
Do you know how to sew things?

979
00:31:41,848 --> 00:31:42,552
Oh.

980
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,296
Of course I know how to sew.

981
00:31:47,255 --> 00:31:48,917
Oh. Okay.

982
00:31:48,918 --> 00:31:50,934
Are you ready to Betsy Ross
the shit out of this dress?

983
00:31:50,934 --> 00:31:50,934
Yes.

984
00:31:51,383 --> 00:31:52,342
Good.

985
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:52,982
This tastes like gasoline.

986
00:31:52,983 --> 00:31:54,198
Good.

987
00:31:54,198 --> 00:31:54,966
'Cause you love
the smell of gasoline.

988
00:31:54,967 --> 00:31:55,925
It's perfect.

989
00:31:56,151 --> 00:31:58,005
We should get some magic
markers while we're here!

990
00:31:58,006 --> 00:31:58,677
Oh, wait.

991
00:31:58,678 --> 00:31:59,605
I know a guy who can
get us marijuana.

992
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:00,662
Ted.

993
00:32:00,663 --> 00:32:01,685
Joe.

994
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:02,708
You should throw
that guy a bone.

995
00:32:02,709 --> 00:32:03,413
Who, Ted?

996
00:32:03,414 --> 00:32:04,469
Joe!

997
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:05,237
I bet he's super good in bed.

998
00:32:05,237 --> 00:32:05,237
(Katie) What?

999
00:32:05,781 --> 00:32:06,740
(Gena) Yeah.

1000
00:32:06,741 --> 00:32:07,699
Why would you say that?

1001
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,044
Have you ever fucked a guy

1002
00:32:09,045 --> 00:32:10,036
who like never got
laid in high school?

1003
00:32:10,037 --> 00:32:11,283
But how would I know that?

1004
00:32:11,284 --> 00:32:13,140
Oh, 'cause they're just
really good at it.

1005
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,355
They're really good at sex,

1006
00:32:14,356 --> 00:32:15,443
'cause they had to wait
for it for so long.

1007
00:32:15,444 --> 00:32:16,661
It's like a total
Krakow situation.

1008
00:32:16,662 --> 00:32:18,004
Krakow?

1009
00:32:18,005 --> 00:32:19,990
Brian Krakow, from
My So Called Life.

1010
00:32:19,991 --> 00:32:21,205
Come on.

1011
00:32:21,206 --> 00:32:22,708
Okay, listen to me.

1012
00:32:22,709 --> 00:32:24,054
There are two different
types of guys in bed.

1013
00:32:24,055 --> 00:32:25,043
Mm-hmm.

1014
00:32:25,044 --> 00:32:26,291
Number one, Brian Krakow.

1015
00:32:26,292 --> 00:32:28,821
Didn't have sex 'til
college, super grateful.

1016

a home down here,

1017

to live in it.

00:32:33,269 --> 00:32:35,092
Number two, Jordan Catalano.

1019
00:32:35,093 --> 00:32:36,338
Won't go near the area.

1020
00:32:36,339 --> 00:32:37,170
Terrified of it.

1021
00:32:37,171 --> 00:32:39,282
Very good looking, but you
know, not worth the time.

1022
00:32:39,283 --> 00:32:41,138
If you ask me-...
What are you doing?

1023
00:32:41,139 --> 00:32:43,634
Why do you have the baby
out of the garbage bag?

1024
00:32:43,635 --> 00:32:45,171
I'm matching the thread
color to the dress.

1025
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:46,546
Uh, it's a wedding dress.

1026
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:47,603
I think maybe it's white.

1027
00:32:47,604 --> 00:32:49,747
(Katie)
Oh, actually...it's ivory.

1028
00:32:49,748 --> 00:32:51,858
Actually, it's pearl.

1029
00:32:51,859 --> 00:32:52,721
Okay.
You know what?

1030
00:32:52,722 --> 00:32:54,481

not make you guys cool.

It makes you... Amazing?

1032

Gorgeous?

Incredible?

Okay.
How fast can you sew?

It'll be faster if I
had a sewing machine.

00:34:10,638 --> 00:34:11,855
Wait, is Katie with them?

1079
00:34:11,856 --> 00:34:12,910
Yes.

1080
00:34:12,911 --> 00:34:14,829
(Trevor) Relax.

1081
00:34:12,911 --> 00:34:14,766
I'm out of here.

1082
00:34:14,766 --> 00:34:15,725
Keep the limo I'll
see you guys tomorrow.

1083
00:34:14,766 --> 00:34:15,981
(Trevor) Dale, come on.

1084
00:34:15,982 --> 00:34:17,678
(Trevor)
I got a table booked downtown.

1085
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,639
(Clyde) What are you doing?

1086
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,949
(Trevor) We've got bottles
(Clyde) Where are you going?

1087
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:20,876
I've got wedding
photos in the morning.

1088
00:34:20,877 --> 00:34:21,933
That is a dick move.

1089
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:23,085
This is like a classy place.

1090
00:34:23,086 --> 00:34:24,525
(Dale)
I've got a wedding tomorrow!

1091
00:34:24,526 --> 00:34:25,710
This is like the
Harvard of strip clubs.

1092
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:26,893
Hey, Joe. I'm gonna
make sure Lector

1093
00:34:26,894 --> 00:34:28,237
brings your drunk
prom queen for you,

1094
00:34:28,238 --> 00:34:29,261
'cause I'm gonna
make it my mission

1095
00:34:29,262 --> 00:34:30,253
to get you in that tonight.

1096
00:34:30,254 --> 00:34:31,533
That's awesome,
but I-I-I...

1097
00:34:31,534 --> 00:34:33,452
can we stop referring
to her as a "that"?

1098
00:34:33,453 --> 00:34:34,862
All right.
You in, Clyde?

1099
00:34:34,863 --> 00:34:37,103
No, I got something
else going on here.

1100
00:34:39,021 --> 00:34:40,974
No, no, no. No females
without a male escort.

1101
00:34:40,975 --> 00:34:41,869
What?

1102
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:44,011
That's really sexist,
and homophobic,

1103
00:34:44,012 --> 00:34:45,710
because you don't...
you don't know us.

1104
00:34:45,711 --> 00:34:46,955
We could be lesbians.

1105
00:34:46,956 --> 00:34:47,916
These are my girlfriends.
What the fuck?

1106
00:34:47,917 --> 00:34:48,557
All right.
Down the street.

1107
00:34:49,037 --> 00:34:49,037
Did you...

1108
00:34:49,966 --> 00:34:51,214
just call us prostitutes?

1109
00:34:51,215 --> 00:34:53,292
Did you just call
us prostitutes?

1110
00:34:53,293 --> 00:34:54,190
Down the street.

1111
00:34:54,191 --> 00:34:56,365
Listen, I got a
scholarship to Princeton.

1112
00:34:56,366 --> 00:34:59,468
Hey,
Dale! Dale, Dale,Dale!

1113
00:34:59,469 --> 00:35:01,484
Can you get us in?

1114
00:35:01,485 --> 00:35:03,244
I didn't know you
guys were coming down.

1115
00:35:03,245 --> 00:35:05,228
Place is kind of gross.

1116
00:35:05,229 --> 00:35:06,571
It's okay.
They're with me.

1117
00:35:06,572 --> 00:35:07,659
Hey, you don't have
to pay for it.

1118
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,645
What is this, misogyny night...
...at Scores?

1119
00:35:10,157 --> 00:35:10,157
We can vote.

1120
00:35:11,021 --> 00:35:12,555
I have never voted.

1121
00:35:12,556 --> 00:35:13,803
Have fun in there.

1122
00:35:13,804 --> 00:35:15,756
You guys'll fit right in.

1123
00:35:16,715 --> 00:35:20,458
Guys... It's in this one!

1124
00:35:20,459 --> 00:35:20,686
(Katie) [SHREAKING]

1125
00:35:21,645 --> 00:35:23,465
It's not even in a
white bag, Katie!

1126
00:35:23,466 --> 00:35:24,460
I got it. I got it. I got it.

1127
00:35:24,461 --> 00:35:25,227
Okay.

1128
00:35:25,483 --> 00:35:25,483
We got it. Done.

1129
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,722
(Katie) [SHRIEKING]

1130
00:35:27,723 --> 00:35:29,034
What are you doing?

1131
00:35:29,035 --> 00:35:30,089
What are you fucking doing?

1132
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:31,114
Don't drop it in the garbage.

1133
00:35:31,115 --> 00:35:32,139
I'm stepping on it.

1134
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:34,602
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

1135
00:35:34,603 --> 00:35:35,626
(Gena/Regan) Katie!

1136
00:35:35,627 --> 00:35:36,683
(Katie)
Okay! I found it...

1137
00:35:36,684 --> 00:35:39,690
Rock n Roll
Hoochie Co...

1138
00:35:39,691 --> 00:35:42,185
This must be what it feels
like to go to the Oscars.

1139
00:35:42,186 --> 00:35:43,400
(Gena)
Ew... it's like Iran in here.

1140
00:35:43,401 --> 00:35:44,552
Okay, so I'm gonna
go find the bathroom,

1141
00:35:44,553 --> 00:35:45,641
and I'm gonna clean
off the dress.

1142
00:35:45,642 --> 00:35:46,633
(Regan) Okay, we'll find Clyde.

1143
00:35:46,634 --> 00:35:47,563
She's not a stripper, right?

1144
00:35:48,491 --> 00:35:49,737
(Regan) She's on a pole.

1145
00:35:49,738 --> 00:35:50,888
Let's rock the red carpet.

1146
00:35:50,889 --> 00:35:52,106
Listen, if I'm not
out in five minutes,

1147
00:35:52,107 --> 00:35:55,048
you should probably
claim the body.

1148
00:35:55,049 --> 00:35:55,946
I'm serious.

1149
00:35:55,947 --> 00:36:05,385


1150
00:36:05,386 --> 00:36:06,217
Hey, can I have some money?

1151
00:36:06,218 --> 00:36:07,336
No.

1152
00:36:07,337 --> 00:36:08,231
We're waiting
for Gena and Clyde,

1153
00:36:08,232 --> 00:36:10,184
and then we're leaving
Pull this dress up,

1154
00:36:10,185 --> 00:36:11,271
you don't work here!

1155
00:36:11,272 --> 00:36:12,391
Can I have some money, please?

1156
00:36:12,392 --> 00:36:13,514
Yeah, definitely.

1157
00:36:13,515 --> 00:36:14,888
Thank you.

1158
00:36:14,889 --> 00:36:16,230
They're just all
such beautiful dancers,

1159
00:36:16,231 --> 00:36:16,298
I can't pick who
to give money to.

1160
00:36:17,257 --> 00:36:18,632
That's so sweet.

1161
00:36:18,633 --> 00:36:19,943
I always ask them
their stories, too.

1162
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:21,609
'Cause you never know
like where they... Oh.

1163
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:23,432
She's gonna be so happy.

1164
00:36:23,433 --> 00:36:24,742
Her son's gonna
have the gift of sight!

1165
00:36:24,743 --> 00:36:25,990
Why don't you ask her
to smoke pot with you?

1166
00:36:25,991 --> 00:36:26,857
Why is that
actually a good idea?

1167
00:36:27,816 --> 00:36:29,159
Is that cool to do?

1168
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,309
Please. I need a
break from "that".

1169
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:31,429
We're not calling her "that".

1170
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,519
We're trying
not to call her "that".

1171
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,901
I called her "that" earlier.

1172
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:38,949
(Joe)
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1173
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:42,023
Your security guy's- the security's...
Thank you.

1174
00:36:42,024 --> 00:36:45,062
That was amazing, but
I'm a little bored now.

1175
00:36:45,062 --> 00:36:47,078
Hey, is there
anything you can do

1176
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,998
to help Joe score with Katie?

1177
00:36:48,999 --> 00:36:49,766
No.

1178
00:36:49,767 --> 00:36:51,175
Why?

1179
00:36:51,176 --> 00:36:52,390
I'm a completely
powerless figurehead.

1180
00:36:52,391 --> 00:36:54,278
I'm like Truman at Geneva.

1181
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:56,293
You mean Truman at Potsdam?

1182
00:36:56,294 --> 00:37:01,158
I think I know what
I'm talking about.

1183
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:04,038
Truman inherited the presidency
because Roosevelt died.

1184
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:05,574
Poor fuck got sworn in,

1185
00:37:05,575 --> 00:37:07,973
flown to Potsdam to deal
with Stalin and Churchill,

1186
00:37:07,974 --> 00:37:10,086
figure out what the fuck to do
with post-war Germany

1187
00:37:10,087 --> 00:37:11,588
and all of Europe.

1188
00:37:11,589 --> 00:37:13,637
Geneva conference is
completely different thing.

1189
00:37:13,638 --> 00:37:16,293
So I think you meant
Truman at Potsdam.

1190
00:37:16,294 --> 00:37:20,133
Oh. I switched it, 'cause
I'm a little drunk.

1191
00:37:20,134 --> 00:37:21,219
It wouldn't have
made sense anyway,

1192
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:24,325
because Truman had the trump
card, he had the Bomb.

1193
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:27,018
So really, he was in
control the whole time.

1194
00:37:31,813 --> 00:37:34,788
Oh, do you believe in magic?

1195
00:37:34,789 --> 00:37:36,997
Yes, I do.
That's... abso- yes.

1196
00:37:36,998 --> 00:37:38,564
Do you believe in
a magic vagina?

1197
00:37:38,565 --> 00:37:38,789
A magic vagina?

1198
00:37:39,748 --> 00:37:41,221
It would bewitch
you with its magic.

1199
00:37:41,222 --> 00:37:43,331
I've been bewitched
by vaginas before.

1200
00:37:43,332 --> 00:37:45,572
It's scary, actually.

1201
00:37:45,573 --> 00:37:47,139
I think I might be stupid.

1202
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,516
Why would you say
that about yourself?

1203
00:37:48,517 --> 00:37:50,020
I don't understand anything

1204
00:37:50,021 --> 00:37:52,066
anyone is talking about,
most of the time.

1205
00:37:52,067 --> 00:37:52,198
That has nothing
to do with intelligence.

1206
00:37:53,157 --> 00:37:54,755
It's like this...

1207
00:37:54,756 --> 00:37:56,163
there's lots of different
kinds of smart,

1208
00:37:56,164 --> 00:37:57,508
you know, and you just

1209
00:37:57,509 --> 00:38:00,419
have to discover
which smart you are.

1210
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,724
See, I-I don't understand
what you just said.

1211
00:38:02,724 --> 00:38:04,418
That's okay, neither do I.

1212
00:38:04,419 --> 00:38:07,139
Be honest, would you
marry a stripper?

1213
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:12,450
Um... Shh... shh...
shh... shh...

1214
00:38:12,451 --> 00:38:14,019
There's no touching allowed.

1215
00:38:14,019 --> 00:38:15,106
Okay.

1216
00:38:15,107 --> 00:38:16,706
Did you know that?

1217
00:38:16,707 --> 00:38:20,131
I... did- hadn't really...
We're not allowed to touch.

1218
00:38:20,132 --> 00:38:21,506
Okay. Well, I'm not...

1219
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:22,755
I mean, my hands
are down. I'm not...

1220
00:38:22,756 --> 00:38:25,377
Mm-mm... But if you
wanted to, you could.

1221
00:38:25,378 --> 00:38:28,481
I'm confused. It's not
allowed, but I can?

1222
00:38:28,482 --> 00:38:31,073
If you wanted to
touch me, you could.

1223
00:38:31,074 --> 00:38:32,704
I'm gonna give it a shot. Okay.

1224
00:38:32,705 --> 00:38:33,537
Okay.

1225
00:38:33,538 --> 00:38:34,595
Just... all right.

1226
00:38:34,596 --> 00:38:38,082
Mm-hmm.
That's $200.

1227
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:39,041
That's $200?

1228
00:38:39,202 --> 00:38:39,969
Mm-hmm.

1229
00:38:40,002 --> 00:38:42,176
That's $200?

1230
00:38:42,177 --> 00:38:44,607
Two-zero-zero.

1231
00:38:44,608 --> 00:38:46,914
Okay. Well, I-I mean, I
feel like that's a...

1232
00:38:46,915 --> 00:38:51,429
that's a-a pretty good...
deal...

1233
00:38:55,265 --> 00:38:56,483
Oh, Genny.

1234
00:38:58,401 --> 00:38:59,208
(Stripper) These guys suck.

1235
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,606
Hand full of splooge.

1236
00:39:08,607 --> 00:39:09,727
Been there.

1237
00:39:09,728 --> 00:39:10,974
Is it your first night?

1238
00:39:10,975 --> 00:39:13,983
No... but pretty rad

1239
00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:16,481
that you think I'm
hot enough to work here.

1240
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,336
You okay?

1241
00:39:18,337 --> 00:39:19,614
No. Because...

1242
00:39:19,615 --> 00:39:22,175
my stupid ex-boyfriend's
in the back right now,

1243
00:39:22,176 --> 00:39:24,190
getting humped by some skank.

1244
00:39:24,191 --> 00:39:25,120
No offense.

1245
00:39:25,121 --> 00:39:26,079
We are skanks.

1246
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:26,208
It's so dumb.

1247
00:39:26,943 --> 00:39:28,317
Like honestly,

1248
00:39:28,318 --> 00:39:29,950
I don't even know why I'm
freaking out about it.

1249
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:31,548
I should be fixing the dress,
not obsessing over him,

1250
00:39:31,549 --> 00:39:33,789
Look, the only reason why Romeo
is back there is because

1251
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:35,391
he knows he's not
getting laid tonight.

1252
00:39:35,392 --> 00:39:36,509
It's true.

1253
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:37,696
Yeah. I mean, if he thought
he had a chance with you,

1254
00:39:38,655 --> 00:39:39,839
he would be all over your ass,

1255
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,198
like a fat kid eating cake.

1256
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:44,286
Thanks.

1257
00:39:44,286 --> 00:39:45,342
Yeah. Men are all
sorts of fucked.

1258
00:39:45,343 --> 00:39:47,101
They feel insecure
for one second

1259
00:39:47,102 --> 00:39:48,766
and they need
to go feel powerful

1260
00:39:48,767 --> 00:39:49,852
for a couple of hours.

1261
00:39:49,853 --> 00:39:50,973
Women feel shitty
about themselves

1262
00:39:50,974 --> 00:39:52,667
and they just go
cry in the bathroom.

1263
00:39:52,668 --> 00:39:53,312
Yeah.

1264
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:57,917
Or they stab each
other in the back.

1265
00:39:57,918 --> 00:39:59,038
Yeah, I guess
there's that, too.

1266
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:00,477
Yeah.

1267
00:40:00,478 --> 00:40:01,725
Oh, that's good.

1268
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,731
Yeah.

1269
00:40:04,732 --> 00:40:05,820
I should like,
do this more often,

1270
00:40:05,821 --> 00:40:07,645
come to these
bathrooms, you know.

1271
00:40:07,646 --> 00:40:11,964
So much cheaper than going
to a fucking therapist.

1272
00:40:11,965 --> 00:40:12,891
Yeah!

1273
00:40:12,892 --> 00:40:14,077
All right!

1274
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:15,262
That's great. Thank you.

1275
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,845
Regan!

1276
00:40:19,804 --> 00:40:21,851
(Trevor) Whoa, we're still having...
What is that?

1277
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:21,852
I need to talk
to her for a second.

1278
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:23,930
Where's Katie?

1279
00:40:23,931 --> 00:40:25,243
I don't know. This place
is like a fucking maze.

1280
00:40:25,244 --> 00:40:25,947
Okay. Well, we gotta
get out of here

1281
00:40:25,948 --> 00:40:26,845
if we're ever gonna...
We need to find Clyde...

1282
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,338
No to get the sewing machine.

1283
00:40:29,339 --> 00:40:30,299
No, it's a change of plans.

1284
00:40:32,476 --> 00:40:34,364
Do you think they'd
let me work here,

1285
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:36,123
if I take my clothes off?

1286
00:40:36,124 --> 00:40:37,913
Oh, my god. You
let her smoke pot?

1287
00:40:37,914 --> 00:40:39,098
I can't control her.

1288
00:40:39,099 --> 00:40:40,123
You can't control her.

1289
00:40:40,124 --> 00:40:41,594
That's hilarious.

1290
00:40:41,595 --> 00:40:42,235
Why are you talking about
me like I'm not here?

1291
00:40:42,236 --> 00:40:43,611
I'm calling Becky,

1292
00:40:43,612 --> 00:40:44,697
and I'm telling her
about the dress,

1293
00:40:44,698 --> 00:40:45,881
'cause I can't
handle this anymore.

1294
00:40:45,882 --> 00:40:47,065
Hah! So you can be
the big fucking hero?

1295
00:40:47,066 --> 00:40:48,377
No! I'm the only
one doing anything!

1296
00:40:48,378 --> 00:40:49,498
You don't handle shit!

1297
00:40:49,499 --> 00:40:50,555
I handle shit.

1298
00:40:50,556 --> 00:40:52,283
(Katie) ...and I handle shit...
What's the plan, Gena?

1299
00:40:52,284 --> 00:40:53,530
It doesn't matter!

1300
00:40:53,531 --> 00:40:55,032
I'm just telling her
about the fucking dress.

1301
00:40:55,033 --> 00:40:55,640
What happens when all the
fucking responsibility

1302
00:40:55,641 --> 00:40:56,506
comes down on you?

1303
00:40:56,506 --> 00:40:56,506
You're gonna call me...

1304
00:40:57,211 --> 00:40:57,945
No.

1305
00:40:57,946 --> 00:40:58,617
Yeah, you are.

1306
00:40:58,618 --> 00:41:00,825
You're gonna call me, and
I'll fucking handle it

1307
00:41:00,826 --> 00:41:01,976
Just like I handled
your abortion,

1308
00:41:01,977 --> 00:41:03,198
because I had to
fucking drive you.

1309
00:41:07,034 --> 00:41:12,697
(Katie) You guys had an
abortion without me?

1310
00:41:12,698 --> 00:41:12,698
Okay.

1311
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:13,818
I'm sorry.

1312
00:41:13,818 --> 00:41:13,818
No.

1313
00:41:14,522 --> 00:41:15,833
Gena, stop.

1314
00:41:15,834 --> 00:41:17,273
What is that shit?

1315
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:18,683
I-I didn't even get to come?

1316
00:41:19,642 --> 00:41:20,951
Clyde, I need you to help me.

1317
00:41:20,952 --> 00:41:21,626
Security!

1318
00:41:21,627 --> 00:41:23,000
Clyde! Come on.

1319
00:41:23,001 --> 00:41:25,305
No, he can't leave.
He owes me $200.

1320
00:41:25,306 --> 00:41:26,361
See this?

1321
00:41:26,362 --> 00:41:27,640
It's worth a lot
of money, okay?

1322
00:41:27,641 --> 00:41:29,080
So don't blow it
all in one place.

1323
00:41:31,833 --> 00:41:33,560
See you later.

1324
00:41:33,561 --> 00:41:34,520
Whatever.

1325
00:41:35,705 --> 00:41:37,624
(Regan) Wait, Gena!

1326
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:38,935
Fuck you!

1327
00:41:38,936 --> 00:41:40,535
(Trevor)
You're a bad-ass.

1328
00:41:40,536 --> 00:41:41,560
Wait! No, no, no, no.

1329
00:41:41,561 --> 00:41:42,999
Oh, no.

1330
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,142
We're not getting on
the floor tonight. Nope.

1331
00:41:45,143 --> 00:41:47,030
We're going... Do I
still look okay?

1332
00:41:47,031 --> 00:41:48,153
We're going home now, okay?

1333
00:41:48,154 --> 00:41:49,751
She really goes
from 60 to zero.

1334
00:41:49,752 --> 00:41:50,743
No, you're not going home.

1335
00:41:50,744 --> 00:41:52,215
You said you needed a break.

1336
00:41:52,216 --> 00:41:53,175
(Regan) That was before.

1337
00:41:52,216 --> 00:41:53,077
(Trevor) You're not going home.

1338
00:41:53,078 --> 00:41:54,232
Joe, take Katie home.

1339
00:41:54,233 --> 00:41:55,734
Whoa. Who is Joe?

1340
00:41:55,735 --> 00:41:56,437
He's right behind you.

1341
00:41:56,438 --> 00:41:56,981
I'm Joe.

1342
00:41:56,982 --> 00:41:58,102
(Trevor) Hello.

1343
00:41:58,103 --> 00:41:58,998
Here's what's happening.

1344
00:41:58,999 --> 00:42:00,821
You're staying with
me, call your friend,

1345
00:42:00,822 --> 00:42:02,934
as soon as she picks up
I'll take you right to her.

1346
00:42:02,935 --> 00:42:03,861
The most efficient
way of handling it.

1347
00:42:03,862 --> 00:42:05,750
Wait, wait, wait. Um... Sorry.

1348
00:42:05,751 --> 00:42:09,429
Think I'm gonna be sick...
No, I'm good. I'm good.

1349
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:10,295
(Trevor) She's good!

1350
00:42:10,295 --> 00:42:10,295
I'm good.

1351
00:42:11,094 --> 00:42:12,437
(Joe) Okay.

1352
00:42:12,438 --> 00:42:14,454
(Trevor)
Aw... Young love.

1353
00:42:14,455 --> 00:42:15,255
(Katie)
All right. Okay.

1354
00:42:15,256 --> 00:42:16,277
(Joe) Okay.

1355
00:42:16,278 --> 00:42:17,621
(Regan) You wanna throw up?

1356
00:42:17,622 --> 00:42:18,197
Here, let me take
you to throw up.

1357
00:42:18,198 --> 00:42:19,092
Uh-uh, I'm good.

1358
00:42:19,093 --> 00:42:19,893
No, come on. Let's go.

1359
00:42:19,894 --> 00:42:21,141
Joe, come here.

1360
00:42:21,142 --> 00:42:22,452
What the fuck is
wrong with you, man?

1361
00:42:22,453 --> 00:42:23,028
I'm trying to get
you alone with her.

1362
00:42:23,029 --> 00:42:23,863
She's GTG, man.

1363
00:42:23,864 --> 00:42:25,396
What's GTG again?

1364
00:42:25,397 --> 00:42:26,196
Good to go!

1365
00:42:26,197 --> 00:42:27,189
She's good to go!

1366
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:28,853
Take her home and slip it in.

1367
00:42:28,854 --> 00:42:30,133
I'm not gonna slip it in.

1368
00:42:30,134 --> 00:42:31,413
She is wasted,
that'd be like rape.

1369
00:42:31,414 --> 00:42:32,916
(Joe) Slipping it in to a girl

1370
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:34,132
that's about to pass out...?

1371
00:42:34,132 --> 00:42:35,414
I'm telling you, take these.

1372
00:42:35,415 --> 00:42:37,076
That'll help.

1373
00:42:37,077 --> 00:42:38,133
What are these?
Are these...

1374
00:42:38,134 --> 00:42:39,989
dude, are these
date rape drugs?

1375
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:40,854
They're fucking Xanax,
dude, for you.

1376
00:42:41,813 --> 00:42:41,814
You're fucking paranoid.

1377
00:42:42,773 --> 00:42:43,766
You smoked too much.

1378
00:42:43,767 --> 00:42:45,396
Would you relax?

1379
00:42:45,397 --> 00:42:45,845
What am I doing?

1380
00:42:45,846 --> 00:42:47,027
[SLAP]

1381
00:42:47,028 --> 00:42:48,436
[SLAP]

1382
00:42:48,437 --> 00:42:49,333
[SLAP]

1383
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:50,226
All right.

1384
00:42:50,227 --> 00:42:50,933
I like to see you man up.

1385
00:42:50,934 --> 00:42:53,461
Now, do you want Regan,
or do you want Katie?

1386
00:42:54,291 --> 00:42:55,381
You can take her.

1387
00:42:56,211 --> 00:42:57,330
Katie's hotter.

1388
00:42:57,331 --> 00:42:58,133
Yeah. Good call.

1389
00:42:59,092 --> 00:42:59,092
Look, she's throwing
up right now,

1390
00:42:59,988 --> 00:43:00,916
that's not so hot.

1391
00:43:00,917 --> 00:43:02,868
What is wrong with you?

1392
00:43:02,869 --> 00:43:03,412
I don't know.

1393
00:43:03,413 --> 00:43:05,043


1394
00:43:05,044 --> 00:43:06,004
(Regan) Hey.

1395
00:43:06,005 --> 00:43:06,005
(Regan) Thank you, Joe.

1396
00:43:06,708 --> 00:43:07,572
All good?

1397
00:43:07,573 --> 00:43:09,491
All right.
Yeah. Yeah.

1398
00:43:09,491 --> 00:43:10,450
(Trevor)
so Joe's going with Katie...

1399
00:43:09,491 --> 00:43:10,002
(Regan) You're going with Joe.

1400
00:43:10,003 --> 00:43:10,802
Great. Yeah.

1401
00:43:10,803 --> 00:43:12,851
We're GTG, we're good to go.

1402
00:43:12,852 --> 00:43:14,098
(Trevor)
Okay. Perfect

1403
00:43:15,699 --> 00:43:16,467
GTG?

1404
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:17,425
Yeah, GTG what?

1405
00:43:17,426 --> 00:43:18,354
Why you stealin' my shit?

1406
00:43:18,354 --> 00:43:19,347
I didn't hear you say that.

1407
00:43:19,348 --> 00:43:20,658
(Trevor) That's my line.

1408
00:43:20,659 --> 00:43:22,997
This is the best night
of my life, you guys!

1409
00:43:24,915 --> 00:43:26,834
How can you not
have a Metro card?

1410
00:43:26,835 --> 00:43:29,266
Uh, because I live
in Los Angeles?

1411
00:43:29,267 --> 00:43:32,113
Yeah, but you've been
here for like a day.

1412
00:43:32,114 --> 00:43:34,608
Thank you, Gena, for
helping me get out of

1413
00:43:34,609 --> 00:43:36,818
that sticky situation
with that wasted stripper

1414
00:43:36,819 --> 00:43:38,449
that I could not pay for.

1415
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:39,471
Oh, you're so welcome, Clyde.

1416
00:43:39,472 --> 00:43:40,623
Are you kidding?

1417
00:43:40,624 --> 00:43:41,682
I could have paid
for the stripper,

1418
00:43:41,683 --> 00:43:44,084
if you hadn't taken my wallet.

1419
00:43:46,961 --> 00:43:47,027
How long are you gonna

1420
00:43:47,986 --> 00:43:49,136
pretend to be mad at me, Gena?

1421
00:43:49,137 --> 00:43:50,288
It's starting to
hurt my feelings.

1422
00:43:50,289 --> 00:43:51,218
Listen to me.

1423
00:43:51,219 --> 00:43:53,681
I've got like mere hours

1424
00:43:53,682 --> 00:43:55,984
to get this dress
fixed and cleaned,

1425
00:43:55,985 --> 00:43:57,874
and make sure nothing
else happens to it,

1426
00:43:57,875 --> 00:44:00,879
so I am so sorry, Clyde,
that your feelings are

1427
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:01,873
not at the top of my list

1428
00:44:01,874 --> 00:44:03,727
of things to give a shit about.

1429
00:44:03,728 --> 00:44:05,777
Wow, so you're
actually mad at me.

1430
00:44:05,778 --> 00:44:07,637
That's interesting.

1431
00:44:11,473 --> 00:44:15,216
You know what You got
pregnant a long time

1432
00:44:15,217 --> 00:44:16,943
- years ago.

1433
00:44:16,944 --> 00:44:18,702
And I felt bad
about it ever since.

1434
00:44:18,703 --> 00:44:19,633
And you know,
there's this thing,

1435
00:44:20,592 --> 00:44:23,343
it's called life, and we
have to get on with it.

1436
00:44:23,344 --> 00:44:24,814
We got pregnant.

1437
00:44:24,815 --> 00:44:26,223
I took care of it.

1438
00:44:26,224 --> 00:44:27,408
You made mix tapes about it.

1439
00:44:27,409 --> 00:44:29,519
I-I was 18.

1440
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,767
I was 15.

1441
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:33,461
You were 16, and
we were in love.

1442
00:44:39,215 --> 00:44:40,591
Remember Fast Times?

1443
00:44:40,592 --> 00:44:41,327
Fast Times?

1444
00:44:41,328 --> 00:44:42,637
You remember that movie?

1445
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:43,790
Do you remember
who the bad guy was?

1446
00:44:43,791 --> 00:44:45,070
It was Damone.

1447
00:44:45,071 --> 00:44:49,293
The asshole didn't show
up for the appointment.

1448
00:44:49,294 --> 00:44:49,935
That's you, mother fucker.

1449
00:44:49,936 --> 00:44:52,589
I am not I am not Damone!

1450
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:53,615
I'm not Damone!

1451
00:44:53,616 --> 00:44:56,430
I can't believe you cannot
see that you are Damone.

1452
00:44:55,471 --> 00:44:58,066
Don't call me ...dude, don't
call me fucking Damone...

1453
00:45:00,943 --> 00:45:02,124
What do you want me
to do about it now?

1454
00:45:02,125 --> 00:45:03,980
I just want you to
help me fix the dress.

1455
00:45:03,981 --> 00:45:05,166
I don't want to
have this conversation.

1456
00:45:05,167 --> 00:45:07,122
I just want to fix the dress.

1457
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:15,148
And chemo when you're 12 sucks.

1458
00:45:15,149 --> 00:45:15,790
Yeah, it's gotta suck.

1459
00:45:15,791 --> 00:45:18,413
I mean, 12 sucks in general,

1460
00:45:18,414 --> 00:45:21,868
especially when you're a
girl That's when it happens.

1461
00:45:21,869 --> 00:45:23,980
When what, when what happens?

1462
00:45:23,981 --> 00:45:26,060
You start hating yourself.

1463
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:28,204
Ah, I can't believe
Gena isn't texting me back!

1464
00:45:28,205 --> 00:45:29,162
Hey, you know what?

1465
00:45:29,163 --> 00:45:30,059
I got an idea.

1466
00:45:30,059 --> 00:45:30,924
Why don't you just relax?

1467
00:45:30,924 --> 00:45:32,427
Put the phone away.

1468
00:45:32,428 --> 00:45:33,867
Doesn't sound like your
friend needs you, anyway.

1469
00:45:33,868 --> 00:45:34,827
No, this was a mistake.

1470
00:45:34,828 --> 00:45:35,532
I gotta go.

1471
00:45:35,533 --> 00:45:36,586
No-no-no-no.

1472
00:45:36,587 --> 00:45:38,220
You're not going.
Stay. Come on.

1473
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:39,308
I want to hear about this.

1474
00:45:39,308 --> 00:45:39,308
Why do you start
to hate yourself?

1475
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,634
'Cause, I, I don't know.

1476
00:45:42,635 --> 00:45:43,467
Uh, you wouldn't understand

1477
00:45:46,987 --> 00:45:46,987
Well, I think,

1478
00:45:47,852 --> 00:45:47,884
I think you're unhappy

1479
00:45:48,843 --> 00:45:50,025
and you have no reason to be,

1480
00:45:50,026 --> 00:45:51,212
and that's what makes
you hate yourself.

1481
00:45:52,171 --> 00:45:54,027
Let me guess, psych major.

1482
00:45:54,028 --> 00:45:56,108
Psych major with a
lucrative advertising job.

1483
00:45:56,109 --> 00:45:57,898
Yeah, yeah, that's good.

1484
00:45:57,899 --> 00:45:59,402
Belittle me.

1485
00:45:59,403 --> 00:46:00,460
Is that what you
do to your boyfriend?

1486
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:02,730
Does that work for him?

1487
00:46:02,731 --> 00:46:03,626
Not really.

1488
00:46:03,627 --> 00:46:04,650
[LAUGH]

1489
00:46:04,651 --> 00:46:05,578
I shouldn't have brought it up.

1490
00:46:05,579 --> 00:46:07,178
Yeah, but you did.

1491
00:46:07,179 --> 00:46:09,001
So probably I would tell
you that you're beautiful

1492
00:46:09,002 --> 00:46:11,368
and what you're doing with
retarded kids is amazing.

1493
00:46:11,369 --> 00:46:12,042
They have cancer.

1494
00:46:12,043 --> 00:46:13,001
Whatever.

1495
00:46:13,355 --> 00:46:15,371
I like to compliment a woman
because she deserves it,

1496
00:46:15,372 --> 00:46:16,809
not because
she needs attention.

1497
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:20,105
I don't need attention.

1498
00:46:20,106 --> 00:46:22,121
Ooh, got off some steam there.

1499
00:46:22,122 --> 00:46:22,823
You're mad.

1500
00:46:22,824 --> 00:46:23,656
I'm not mad.

1501
00:46:23,657 --> 00:46:24,585
Are you kidding me?

1502
00:46:24,586 --> 00:46:27,208
You're fucking livid.

1503
00:46:27,209 --> 00:46:28,456
Oh, don't do that.

1504
00:46:28,457 --> 00:46:30,375
Just want to give
you what you want.

1505
00:46:32,042 --> 00:46:33,576
What do I want?

1506
00:46:33,577 --> 00:46:35,306
You want somebody to
put you in your place.

1507
00:46:36,265 --> 00:46:37,416
Where's that?

1508
00:46:37,417 --> 00:46:38,792
Where do you want it?

1509
00:46:38,793 --> 00:46:42,055
Ah! Harder!

1510
00:46:42,056 --> 00:46:44,968
Uh, harder!

1511
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:48,743
Shut the Fuck Up

1512
00:46:48,744 --> 00:46:50,504
Yeah, you shut the fuck up.

1513
00:46:50,504 --> 00:46:57,127
Yeah, shut the fuck up cunt.

1514

[PHONE RINGING]

1515
00:46:58,824 --> 00:47:01,990
Shit! Shit, shit.

1516
00:47:01,991 --> 00:47:03,910
Fuck. Shit, shit.

1517
00:47:03,911 --> 00:47:04,935
Hey.

1518
00:47:04,936 --> 00:47:05,830
[Becky] Hey, this is Becks.

1519
00:47:05,831 --> 00:47:06,949
Can you come to my room?

1520
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:07,877
Oh yeah.
I'm not doing anything.

1521
00:47:07,878 --> 00:47:08,998
[Becky] We need to talk.

1522
00:47:08,999 --> 00:47:10,054
Yeah, I'll be
there in a minute.

1523
00:47:10,054 --> 00:47:10,918
Uh, give me a couple minutes.

1524
00:47:10,919 --> 00:47:11,751
[Becky] Okay.

1525
00:47:11,752 --> 00:47:12,550
Okay.

1526
00:47:12,551 --> 00:47:12,551
[Becky] Bye.

1527
00:47:12,968 --> 00:47:13,737
Bye.

1528
00:47:16,614 --> 00:47:18,249
Don't cum on my dress.

1529
00:47:20,167 --> 00:47:20,999
I can't believe
we're doing this.

1530
00:47:21,607 --> 00:47:23,334
I can't believe I
gave all my coke

1531
00:47:23,335 --> 00:47:24,837
to your filthy stripper.

1532
00:47:24,838 --> 00:47:26,949
Do me a favor and
don't mention that

1533
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:28,167
in your recap of the evening.

1534
00:47:28,168 --> 00:47:30,981
Aw, that's my
favorite part, though.

1535
00:47:30,982 --> 00:47:32,198
(Clyde's Mom) Clyde?

1536
00:47:32,199 --> 00:47:33,509
Hey, Mom.

1537
00:47:33,509 --> 00:47:34,694
I thought you
were at a wedding.

1538
00:47:34,695 --> 00:47:36,262
(Clyde) You remember...?

1539
00:47:36,263 --> 00:47:37,414
Gena?

1540
00:47:37,415 --> 00:47:38,598
I don't think you've eaten

1541
00:47:38,599 --> 00:47:40,708
since the last time I saw you.

1542
00:47:40,709 --> 00:47:42,084
We need your help.

1543
00:47:42,085 --> 00:47:43,044
(Gena) Yeah.

1544
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:45,989
(Clyde's Mom) Oh my Lord.

1545
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:47,525
It's a really long story

1546
00:47:47,526 --> 00:47:49,128
without much of a payoff, so...

1547
00:47:51,046 --> 00:47:52,034
I've seen worse.

1548
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:53,060
When do you need it?

1549
00:47:53,061 --> 00:47:54,181
Three hours.

1550
00:47:54,182 --> 00:47:56,931
It's a miracle you need, not me.

1551
00:47:56,932 --> 00:47:59,490
Sheila, you made every
one of the costumes

1552
00:47:59,491 --> 00:48:00,451
for all the schools plays

1553
00:48:00,452 --> 00:48:03,171
and you made my prom
dress from scratch!

1554
00:48:03,172 --> 00:48:04,679
You can do it.

1555
00:48:06,597 --> 00:48:10,308
Clyde, make us some
coffee and food.

1556
00:48:10,309 --> 00:48:11,075
Gena?

1557
00:48:11,076 --> 00:48:11,939
Yeah?

1558
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:15,335
I'll get you some pants.

1559
00:48:18,212 --> 00:48:21,447
(Joe) Why are doors so heavy
in this place? Uh-oh.

1560
00:48:24,324 --> 00:48:25,604
I don't think
this is your room.

1561
00:48:25,605 --> 00:48:26,594
No, no.

1562
00:48:26,594 --> 00:48:28,291
This is definitely my room.

1563
00:48:28,292 --> 00:48:30,373
But somebody has moved
the furniture around.

1564
00:48:31,332 --> 00:48:34,146
They put a pool right in
the middle of my room.

1565
00:48:34,147 --> 00:48:36,041
(Joe)
This is fucking fantastic!

1566
00:48:42,754 --> 00:48:43,811
(Katie) Wait, are you coming?

1567
00:48:43,812 --> 00:48:45,990
(Joe)
Yeah. I am.

1568
00:48:49,826 --> 00:48:51,873
Oh!

1569
00:48:51,873 --> 00:48:53,506
It's beautiful!

1570
00:48:53,507 --> 00:48:54,657
You okay?

1571
00:48:54,658 --> 00:48:56,129
It's beautiful.

1572
00:48:56,130 --> 00:48:57,890
Moments like these,
I think to myself,

1573
00:48:57,890 --> 00:48:57,890
my parents have no idea

1574
00:48:58,594 --> 00:48:59,235
where I am right now.

1575
00:49:01,153 --> 00:49:01,984
Ah.

1576
00:49:01,985 --> 00:49:03,680
I'm so awake now.

1577
00:49:03,681 --> 00:49:06,017
Watch me do a handstand!

1578
00:49:06,018 --> 00:49:07,685
Be careful, it's
three feet deep.

1579
00:49:11,521 --> 00:49:13,249
You're seriously making
pancakes right now?

1580
00:49:13,696 --> 00:49:14,720
I am.

1581
00:49:14,721 --> 00:49:17,504
Yours has a sad face made
out of chocolate chips,

1582
00:49:17,505 --> 00:49:22,561
because the world is an asshole
and it's gonna get you.

1583
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,367
Why are you on your phone
at 4.30 in the a.m.?

1584
00:49:26,368 --> 00:49:30,916
Don't worry about it, you know?

1585
00:49:34,752 --> 00:49:39,838
And... I am totally tagging
you in that photo.

1586
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,657
You totally stalk me
online, don't you?

1587
00:49:44,575 --> 00:49:45,473
Maybe.

1588
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:48,835
Sometimes.

1589
00:49:51,712 --> 00:49:53,056
Weekly.

1590
00:49:54,015 --> 00:49:55,166
Pervert.

1591
00:49:55,167 --> 00:49:57,086
Who are you calling?

1592
00:49:57,087 --> 00:49:57,853
Who are you calling?

1593
00:49:57,854 --> 00:49:58,911
You're so nosy.

1594
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:02,589
I'm calling my friend's dealer,
okay, so I can get some

1595
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:04,799
cocaine for tonight, so
I can make it through.

1596
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,357
Give me my phone back.

1597
00:50:07,358 --> 00:50:08,637
Give it back to me.

1598
00:50:08,638 --> 00:50:10,428
Give it to me.

1599
00:50:10,429 --> 00:50:11,324
What are you doing?

1600
00:50:11,325 --> 00:50:12,381
Why did you do that?!

1601
00:50:12,382 --> 00:50:13,724
Oh my God!

1602
00:50:13,725 --> 00:50:15,004
I can't believe that

once off 'shrooms

did I just have
sex with a hamburger?

with a broken bottle.

and I'm one of them,

2313
01:16:41,163 --> 01:16:42,923
I think you have to screw it up

2314
01:16:42,924 --> 01:16:46,474
uh, before you realize
that you've got it good.

2315
01:16:46,475 --> 01:16:49,162
I-I I'm just excited
because Gena and I,

2316
01:16:49,163 --> 01:16:50,539
we had sex last night.

2317
01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:51,627
What the fuck?

2318
01:16:51,628 --> 01:16:53,065
We did, but like
who cares, right?

2319
01:16:53,066 --> 01:16:53,675
I-I can say that.

2320
01:16:53,676 --> 01:16:55,210
Can I say that?

2321
01:16:55,211 --> 01:16:59,754
But the thing is, is when
we're having sex, it's fine,

2322
01:16:59,755 --> 01:17:05,962
I put my penis uh, into um,
Gena's vagina... Please.

2323
01:17:05,963 --> 01:17:07,850
And then I took it out.

2324
01:17:07,851 --> 01:17:10,825
And then I, I put it in again.

2325
01:17:10,826 --> 01:17:12,072
And then I took it out.

2326
01:17:12,299 --> 01:17:15,497
And then it just kinda went
on like that for a while.

2327
01:17:15,498 --> 01:17:16,682
And I, what I realized

2328
01:17:16,683 --> 01:17:19,177
was I wanted to
just keep doing that

2329
01:17:19,178 --> 01:17:22,089
for the rest of my life.

2330
01:17:22,090 --> 01:17:26,121
That's kinda where
I am at right now.

2331
01:17:26,122 --> 01:17:27,530
Uh, but that's not the only
reason I'm up here.

2332
01:17:27,531 --> 01:17:33,544
I'm also um, here to,

01:17:44,456 --> 01:17:47,913
I'm gonna be the man who...
yeah, really? Okay.

2338
01:17:47,914 --> 01:17:50,055
No, I can't sing.

2339
01:17:50,056 --> 01:17:52,039
But you understand what
I was trying to do?

2340
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:53,576
Yeah.

2341
01:17:53,576 --> 01:17:54,758
Yeah? All right.

2342
01:17:54,759 --> 01:17:55,817
Well, I'm gonna,
I'm gonna pass it off...
