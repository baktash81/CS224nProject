close, he'll run and hide.

The ambassador to Spain,
Senor Caldero.

00:19:26,247 --> 00:19:27,566
What?

88
00:19:27,607 --> 00:19:29,006
Senor Calderon.

89
00:19:29,047 --> 00:19:31,163
Yes, all right. Not now.

90
00:19:31,247 --> 00:19:34,205
- It is a matter of importance, sir.
- God bless you all!

91
00:19:41,327 --> 00:19:46,162
I'm trying to drink my brandy
after a very long day.

92
00:19:46,367 --> 00:19:48,278
I simply wasn't certain

93
00:19:48,327 --> 00:19:52,764
whether this was something you wanted
to take care of personally.

94
00:19:52,807 --> 00:19:56,766
Leder, there are what, four million
Negroes in this country?

95
00:19:56,847 --> 00:20:01,284
Why on earth should I concern
myself with these forty-four? Hmm?

96
00:20:01,327 --> 00:20:03,124
Well, there are reasons.

97
00:20:03,167 --> 00:20:06,239
I don't care how.
You just take care of it.

98
00:20:09,607 --> 00:20:11,723
The ship is Amistad.

99
00:20:12,687 --> 00:20:16,157
It's too small to be
a transatlantic slaver.

100
00:20:16,247 --> 00:20:19,284
They're plantation slaves, then?
West Indians?

101
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,238
Not necessarily.

102
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:24,165
At least they certainly
don't look it.

103
00:20:24,207 --> 00:20:28,246
Not from the glimpse I caught of them
on their way to jail.

104
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:30,596
They have these...scars.

105
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:32,524
- Scars?
- Yeah.

106
00:20:35,847 --> 00:20:37,883
(Church bell strikes)

107
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:51,681
They were first detained by officers
of a brig off Long Island.

108
00:20:51,727 --> 00:20:56,005
They were conveyed to New Haven -
under what authority, I don't know -

109
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:58,117
and given over to
the local constabulary.

110
00:20:58,167 --> 00:21:02,001
About forty of them,
including four or five children.

111
00:21:08,887 --> 00:21:11,765
The arraignment
is day after tomorrow.

112
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:14,605
I can only assume that
the charge is murder.

113
00:21:14,647 --> 00:21:17,161
I'll see what I can do about that.

114
00:21:18,127 --> 00:21:22,882
Perhaps a writ for illegal arrest
and detainment to stall things.

115
00:21:22,927 --> 00:21:26,761
At the very least,
make sure they have good counsel.

116
00:22:07,487 --> 00:22:09,955
(Native language) Chief! Chief!

117
00:22:11,887 --> 00:22:13,878
He's not a chief!

118
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:16,478
Brother! Brother!

119
00:22:17,887 --> 00:22:20,003
He's not your brother.

120
00:22:21,567 --> 00:22:25,321
- What is he then?
- He's a white man.

00:23:02,767 --> 00:23:06,680
The bench recognises
District Attorney Holabird.

126
00:23:07,007 --> 00:23:10,158
I would like to present
the court, Your Honour,

127
00:23:10,207 --> 00:23:12,880
with the charges
of piracy and murder...

128
00:23:12,927 --> 00:23:15,680
I have a petition for
a writ of habeas corpus.

129
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,638
I was speaking.

130
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:21,919
Mr Holabird, your charges, whatever
they might be, will be rendered moot.

131
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:25,482
That petition, Mr Tappan
- if that's what it is - is moot,

132
00:23:25,527 --> 00:23:30,806
until an actual writ by some higher
court, by some miracle, is granted.

133
00:23:30,847 --> 00:23:34,237
- Mr Holabird is correct.
- And if you would, sir,

134
00:23:34,327 --> 00:23:38,286
please kindly refrain from
impersonating a lawyer,

135
00:23:38,327 --> 00:23:40,477
which you patently are not.

136
00:23:40,527 --> 00:23:43,121
- As I was saying, Your Honour...
- Your Honour.

137
00:23:45,607 --> 00:23:47,438
Mr Secretary.

138
00:23:47,487 --> 00:23:52,242
Your Honour, I am here on behalf of
the President of the United States,

139
00:23:52,287 --> 00:23:55,996
representing the claims of
Queen Isabella of Spain,

140
00:23:56,047 --> 00:23:59,960
as concerns our mutual treaty
on the high seas of 1795.

141
00:24:00,047 --> 00:24:02,322
- You have my attention.
- Thank you.

142
00:24:02,367 --> 00:24:05,165
These slaves, Your Honour,
are the property of Spain,

143
00:24:05,207 --> 00:24:10,565
and as such, under Article 9 of said
treaty, are to be returned posthaste.

144
00:24:10,607 --> 00:24:13,758
Said treaty taking precedence
over all other claims...

145
00:24:13,807 --> 00:24:16,640
Them slaves belong to me
and my mate, Your Majesty.

146
00:24:16,687 --> 00:24:19,759
- Your Honour, I...
- Who be you two gentlemen?

- Your Honour...

153
00:24:39,287 --> 00:24:43,599
You wish to make this claim above
that of the Queen of Spain?

154
00:24:43,647 --> 00:24:45,524
Where was she, pray,

155
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:49,003
when we was fightin' the winds,
Your Excellen...uh, Honour.

156

Her Majesty, the Queen of Spain,
was busy ruling a country.

claims are just...

00:24:57,047 --> 00:24:58,958
Your Honour!

159
00:25:00,847 --> 00:25:04,681
Here are the true owners
of these slaves.

161

- Order!
- On their behalf...

162
00:25:09,527 --> 00:25:12,997
I am in possession of
a receipt for purchase

163

executed in Havana, Cuba,
June 26, 1839,

I do hereby call upon this court
to immediately surrender...

- ..these goods!

Pedro Montes.

00:25:43,967 --> 00:25:46,242
Ah, Mr Tappan. How do you do, sir?

171
00:25:46,287 --> 00:25:49,882
My name is Roger S Baldwin,
attorney-at-law.

172
00:25:49,967 --> 00:25:51,878
Real estate?

173
00:25:51,927 --> 00:25:54,487
Real estate, inventories
and other assets.

174
00:25:54,527 --> 00:25:58,440
- Can I help you with something?
- What is it that you do?

175
00:25:59,567 --> 00:26:02,684
Well, I own various business...
and banks.

176
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:07,517
As a matter of fact, you probably
could help me, Mr Tappan. (Chuckles)

177
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:10,764
But that's not why I'm here.
I'd like to help you.

- Yes. I deal with property.

00:26:13,767 --> 00:26:16,235
Sometimes I get people's
property back,

180
00:26:16,287 --> 00:26:18,960
other times I get it taken away,
as in this case.

181
00:26:19,007 --> 00:26:22,397
Every one of the claims speaks
to the issue of ownership.

182
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:26,235
- Thank you, Mr...Mr Baldwin.
- Baldwin, Roger S, attorney-at-law.

183
00:26:26,287 --> 00:26:31,077
(Chuckles) But I'm afraid what's
needed here is a criminal attorney.

184
00:26:31,127 --> 00:26:33,925
A trial lawyer.
But thanks for your interest.

185
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:36,276
Yes. Well...

186
00:26:36,367 --> 00:26:41,282
intending no disrespect, Mr Tappan,
but if that were the way to go,

187
00:26:41,367 --> 00:26:43,198
well, then...

188
00:26:43,287 --> 00:26:46,279
Well, I wouldn't have bothered
coming down here.

189
00:26:46,327 --> 00:26:48,238
(Tappan laughs)

190
00:26:51,367 --> 00:26:54,245
Goodbye. I bid you gentlemen
a good afternoon.

191
00:26:55,767 --> 00:26:57,485
In closing,...

192
00:26:57,527 --> 00:27:01,122
I call upon our distinguished
colleague from Massachusetts,

193
00:27:01,207 --> 00:27:04,165
Representative John Quincy Adams

194
00:27:04,207 --> 00:27:07,722
to reweigh his unmeet
and unprecedented attempt

195
00:27:07,767 --> 00:27:12,204
to convert this eccentric
bequest of - let's be frank -

196
00:27:12,247 --> 00:27:15,080
a bunch of junk of
one James Smithson,

197
00:27:15,127 --> 00:27:19,006
into a so-called institute
of national treasure!

198
00:27:19,087 --> 00:27:20,998
(Man coughs)

199
00:27:22,327 --> 00:27:25,637
Perhaps Mr Adams is meditating
on his response.

200
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:27,598
(Laughter)

201
00:27:37,207 --> 00:27:42,361
Had I thought your remarks worthy
of riposte, Representative Pinckney,

202
00:27:42,407 --> 00:27:46,798
be assured you'd have heard
from me...hours ago!

203
00:27:47,927 --> 00:27:52,045
- Who?
- Mr Tappan. Lewis Tappan.

204
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,998
Yeah?

205
00:27:54,087 --> 00:27:56,965
I must see him?
I'm required to see him?

206
00:27:57,007 --> 00:27:58,963
No, sir. He requests an audience.

207
00:27:59,007 --> 00:28:00,918
Give me your hand.

208
00:28:01,127 --> 00:28:03,197
Oh, he requests, does he?

209
00:28:03,247 --> 00:28:06,956
Yeah. I don't know
anyone called Tappan.

210
00:28:07,007 --> 00:28:10,636
- Sir, you do. You've met him often.
- Where?

211
00:28:10,687 --> 00:28:13,155
- Where is he?
- He's right over there, sir.

212
00:28:13,207 --> 00:28:15,038
Oh.

213
00:28:15,127 --> 00:28:17,322
- What is that?
- (Coin clinking)

214
00:28:17,367 --> 00:28:19,278
- Where?
- Right there, sir.

215
00:28:19,367 --> 00:28:22,040
Lewis! Good to see you again!

216
00:28:22,087 --> 00:28:24,078
- And you, sir.
- (Laughs)

217
00:28:24,127 --> 00:28:26,960
- This is Theodore Joadson.
- How do you do, sir?

218
00:28:27,047 --> 00:28:30,676
- An honour to meet you, sir.
- Yeah.

219
00:28:30,727 --> 00:28:33,958
- Sir? Is there somewhere...
- Let's stroll in the garden...

220
00:28:34,047 --> 00:28:36,322
- Yes.
- What?

221
00:28:36,367 --> 00:28:38,517
Let go of my arm. Over here.

222
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:46,361
(Tappan) This case has
great significance.

223
00:28:46,407 --> 00:28:49,205
Our secretary of state
is paying it his attention.

224
00:28:49,287 --> 00:28:51,721
(Adams) You don't have to shout!

225
00:28:51,807 --> 00:28:56,198
(Tappan) He supports the Queen's
claim that she owns the Africans.

226
00:28:56,247 --> 00:28:59,922
- Two sailors are making claims.
- (Adams) What season is it?

227
00:28:59,967 --> 00:29:02,686
- Pardon?
- I said, what season is it?

228
00:29:02,767 --> 00:29:04,803
I don't understand what you mean.

229
00:29:04,847 --> 00:29:08,920
There are two ways of knowing
without consulting a calendar.

230
00:29:09,007 --> 00:29:11,362
The leaves on the maple trees
have all gone,

231
00:29:11,407 --> 00:29:16,162
and the fact that the President is
not at home on Pennsylvania Avenue.

232
00:29:16,207 --> 00:29:18,163
Tell me, sir...

233
00:29:18,207 --> 00:29:21,404
Do you really think Van Buren
cares about the whims

234
00:29:21,447 --> 00:29:24,405
of an 11-year-old girl
who wears a tiara?

235
00:29:24,447 --> 00:29:29,237
I assure you, only one thing occupies
his thoughts this time of the year,

236
00:29:29,287 --> 00:29:34,077
being all things to all people,
which means nothing to no one.

237
00:29:34,167 --> 00:29:37,637
In other words,
gettin' himself re-elected.

238
00:29:37,887 --> 00:29:39,798
Give me a hand.

239
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:44,478
Huh?

240
00:29:46,487 --> 00:29:49,160
- Will you help us, sir?
- Let go of my arm.

241
00:29:50,327 --> 00:29:52,238
Take my stick.

242
00:29:53,007 --> 00:29:55,965
- Mr Adams?
- Yeah, what?

243
00:29:56,047 --> 00:30:00,563
As an advocate for the abolition
of slavery, will you help us?

244
00:30:00,607 --> 00:30:05,317
I'm neither friend nor foe to the
abolitionist cause. I won't help you.

245
00:30:05,367 --> 00:30:07,039
(Joadson) Sir...

246
00:30:07,087 --> 00:30:10,875
- What?
- I know you, Mr President.

247
00:30:10,927 --> 00:30:15,205
I know you and your presidency as
well as any man, and your father's.

248
00:30:15,247 --> 00:30:18,762
You were a child at his side
when he helped invent America.

249
00:30:18,807 --> 00:30:23,085
You, in turn, have devoted your life
to refining that noble invention.

250
00:30:23,127 --> 00:30:25,357
There remains but one task undone.

251
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:28,444
One vital task the Founding
Fathers left to their sons,

252
00:30:28,487 --> 00:30:32,958
before their 13 colonies could
precisely be called United States.

253
00:30:33,007 --> 00:30:37,762
And that task, sir, as you
well know, is crushing slavery.

254
00:30:37,807 --> 00:30:42,437
Your record confirms you're an
abolitionist, sir, even if you won't.

255
00:30:42,527 --> 00:30:45,360
- And whether or not you admit it...
- Mr Joadson.

256
00:30:45,407 --> 00:30:47,363
..you belong with us.

257
00:30:49,167 --> 00:30:50,998
(Sniffs)

258
00:30:51,047 --> 00:30:54,244
You're quite the scholar,
Mr Joadson, aren't ya?

259
00:30:54,287 --> 00:30:56,482
Quite the historian.

260
00:30:59,687 --> 00:31:03,600
Let me tell you about
that quality, if I might.

261
00:31:03,687 --> 00:31:08,522
Without an accompanying mastery of at
least one-tenth its measure of grace,

262
00:31:08,607 --> 00:31:11,519
such erudition is worthless, sir.

263
00:31:12,127 --> 00:31:14,766
Now, you take it from one who knows.

264
00:31:17,287 --> 00:31:20,040
If you gentlemen will excuse me.

265
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:21,964
(Sniffs)

266
00:31:22,967 --> 00:31:26,801
- We know we aimed high asking you...
- Well, aim lower!

267
00:31:27,447 --> 00:31:31,281
Find yourselves someone
whose inspiration blossoms

268
00:31:31,327 --> 00:31:33,238
the more you lose.

269
00:31:37,487 --> 00:31:39,682
(Joadson) If the court
awards them to Spain,

270
00:31:39,727 --> 00:31:42,161
they'll be taken to Cuba
and executed.

271
00:31:42,207 --> 00:31:46,758
If the two lieutenants prevail,
they'll likely to sell them to Spain,

272
00:31:46,807 --> 00:31:48,684
and they'll be executed.

273
00:31:48,727 --> 00:31:51,287
If Montes and Ruiz are successful...

274
00:31:51,327 --> 00:31:55,036
I'm a little confused.
What are they worth to you?

275
00:31:55,087 --> 00:31:58,443
We're discussing the case,
not its expense.

276
00:31:58,487 --> 00:32:03,959
Of course. Well, the case is much
simpler than you think, Mr Tappan.

277
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:07,795
It's like anything - land,
livestock, heirlooms, what have you.

278
00:32:08,407 --> 00:32:10,318
Livestock.

279
00:32:11,967 --> 00:32:13,878
Yes. Consider -

280
00:32:13,927 --> 00:32:18,443
the only way one may sell or purchase
slaves is if they are born slaves,

281
00:32:18,487 --> 00:32:20,398
as on the plantation.

282
00:32:21,767 --> 00:32:24,201
- I'm right, aren't I?
- Yes.

283
00:32:24,247 --> 00:32:26,636
- So, are they?
- "Are they?"

284
00:32:26,687 --> 00:32:30,236
Yes. Born slaves,
as on a plantation.

285
00:32:30,287 --> 00:32:33,120
We're not certain,
but we very much doubt it.

286
00:32:33,167 --> 00:32:36,045
Let's say they are.
Then they are possessions,

287
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:39,397
and no more deserving of
a criminal trial than a bookcase.

288
00:32:39,447 --> 00:32:42,484
On the other hand,
let's say they aren't slaves,

289
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:45,439
in which case they were
illegally acquired.

290
00:32:45,487 --> 00:32:48,638
Forget mutiny, forget piracy,
forget murder.

291
00:32:48,687 --> 00:32:50,996
Those are irrelevant occurrences.

292
00:32:51,047 --> 00:32:54,198
Ignore everything but
the pre-eminent issue at hand.

293
00:32:54,287 --> 00:32:57,324
The wrongful transfer
of stolen goods.

294
00:32:57,407 --> 00:32:59,477
Either way, we win.

295
00:32:59,527 --> 00:33:03,645
Sir, this war must be waged on
the battlefield of righteousness.

296
00:33:03,687 --> 00:33:06,121
The what?

297
00:33:06,207 --> 00:33:09,324
It would be against
everything I stand for

298
00:33:09,367 --> 00:33:13,599
to let this deteriorate into
an exercise in legal minutia.

299
00:33:13,647 --> 00:33:17,356
Mr Tappan, I'm talking about
the heart of the matter.

300
00:33:17,407 --> 00:33:18,920
As am I.

301
00:33:18,967 --> 00:33:23,722
It is our destiny,
as abolitionists and as Christians,

302
00:33:23,767 --> 00:33:25,644
to save these people.

303
00:33:25,687 --> 00:33:28,918
These are people, Mr Baldwin,
not livestock.

304
00:33:28,967 --> 00:33:32,880
Did Christ hire a lawyer
to get him off on technicalities?

305
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:36,761
He went to the cross, nobly.
You know why?

306
00:33:37,607 --> 00:33:39,598
To make a statement.

307
00:33:40,407 --> 00:33:42,967
To make a statement, as must we.

308
00:33:45,767 --> 00:33:47,678
But Christ lost.

309
00:33:48,367 --> 00:33:50,597
- You, I think...
- No, sir, he did not.

310
00:33:50,647 --> 00:33:54,401
- You want to win, don't you?
- Yes.

311
00:33:54,447 --> 00:33:58,998
I certainly do. Hell, sometimes
I don't get paid unless I do.

312
00:33:59,087 --> 00:34:02,523
Which brings us back to
the question of worth.

313
00:34:02,567 --> 00:34:06,037
In order to do a better job
than the Son of God's attorney

314
00:34:06,087 --> 00:34:09,762
I'll require two and a
half dollars a day.

315
00:34:21,327 --> 00:34:23,841
(Mende) Who are they, do you think?

316
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:31,845
Looks like they're going to be sick.

317
00:34:34,007 --> 00:34:38,046
(All) # Amazing grace

318
00:34:38,127 --> 00:34:40,516
# How sweet the sound... #

319
00:34:40,567 --> 00:34:42,842
(Mende) They're entertainers!

320
00:34:43,407 --> 00:34:48,117
- # That saved a wretch like me... #
- But why do they look so miserable?

321
00:34:49,807 --> 00:34:53,561
# I once was lost

322
00:34:53,607 --> 00:34:58,203
# But now am found... #

323
00:35:08,047 --> 00:35:10,163
(Mende) You don't belong here.

324
00:35:10,207 --> 00:35:13,085
Your table doesn't belong here.

325
00:35:20,407 --> 00:35:23,319
(Mende) This is Temne land.

326
00:35:27,087 --> 00:35:30,796
How do you do, sir? How do you do?

327
00:35:30,847 --> 00:35:34,044
(Mende) You want to sit?
Sit here in Mendeland.

328
00:35:34,327 --> 00:35:36,443
What are you doing, Temne?

329
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:41,045
You want trouble?
Cross into our territory again.

330
00:35:41,247 --> 00:35:44,637
What is this?
Get this table out of here!

331
00:35:44,847 --> 00:35:47,645
Let me show you to Sherbroland.

332
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,598
(Arguing)

333
00:35:58,327 --> 00:36:00,238
There?

334
00:36:17,727 --> 00:36:19,843
(Speaks menacingly in Mende)

335
00:36:25,487 --> 00:36:28,081
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

336
00:36:29,967 --> 00:36:32,083
Excuse me. I...
My name is Roger Baldwin.

337
00:36:32,127 --> 00:36:35,437
This is Theodore Joadson
of the Anti-slavery Society

338
00:36:35,487 --> 00:36:38,445
and owner of the Forten
Shipping Service.

339
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:42,082
And this is Professor Gibbs,
a linguist.

340
00:36:43,207 --> 00:36:45,038
(Mende) What do you want?

341
00:36:45,087 --> 00:36:47,760
Keep talking. Get them to talk.

342
00:36:48,887 --> 00:36:51,037
Have you seen this before?

343
00:36:51,087 --> 00:36:55,399
(Mende) I could kill you with my bare
hands before you raise that sword.

344
00:36:55,447 --> 00:36:58,519
- This belongs to you?
- (Makes slashing sounds)

345
00:36:59,687 --> 00:37:01,996
(Gibbs makes slashing sound)

346
00:37:02,087 --> 00:37:03,998
No.

347
00:37:05,727 --> 00:37:07,399
Umm...

348
00:37:07,447 --> 00:37:10,280
I need to know where you're from.

349
00:37:10,327 --> 00:37:12,682
(Gibbs) Uh...
(Speaks African dialect)

350
00:37:17,367 --> 00:37:19,278
(Mende) What did he say?

351
00:37:19,847 --> 00:37:23,123
(Mende) I didn't understand a word.
It's gibberish.

352
00:37:23,167 --> 00:37:25,635
He said, I think, "Show me the map."

353
00:37:25,687 --> 00:37:28,155
(Mende) Do you think
he's here to help us?

354
00:37:28,207 --> 00:37:29,686
I don't know.

355
00:37:29,727 --> 00:37:32,366
He reminds me of that Fula of Baoma.

356
00:37:32,407 --> 00:37:37,720
The one who hires himself out to
scrape elephant dung from the crops.

357
00:37:38,087 --> 00:37:43,320
A dung-scraper might be just the kind
of man we need right now.

358
00:37:43,767 --> 00:37:46,759
(Baldwin) Here, Africa...
Is this where you're from?

359
00:37:46,807 --> 00:37:48,957
A-fri-ca.

360
00:37:49,847 --> 00:37:52,361
(Mende) What does he want?

361
00:37:52,847 --> 00:37:56,362
- (Mende) He's an idiot.
- Were you born in the West Indies?

362
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:59,285
(Spanish)
Were you born in the West Indies?

363
00:38:02,127 --> 00:38:04,766
(Mende) All three of them are idiots.

364
00:38:04,807 --> 00:38:06,923
What did he say?

365
00:38:07,087 --> 00:38:11,763
Oh, he said, er...
They have to go away.

366
00:38:15,607 --> 00:38:18,963
- (Shouting)
- Emancipation! It's God's way!

367
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:21,925
You cannot own another human being!

368
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:24,800
- Killers of white men!
- Slavery is tyranny!

369
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:28,481
(Mende) It's those miserable-looking
people again.

370
00:38:33,447 --> 00:38:35,756
God's blessing on you this morning.

371
00:38:35,807 --> 00:38:38,765
(Mende) I'm not afraid of you,
or your medicine!

372
00:38:38,807 --> 00:38:43,881
Yes. You place your hand on
this book and I'll pray for you.

373
00:38:45,287 --> 00:38:48,757
(Woman in crowd) They're
human beings, not animals!

374
00:38:48,807 --> 00:38:51,082
(Man) Slavery will kill this country!

375
00:38:51,127 --> 00:38:53,038
(Slaves chatter)

376
00:38:55,727 --> 00:38:58,195
(Holabird) ..in the
quietude of the night

377
00:38:58,247 --> 00:39:03,367
after the Spaniards attended their
vespers and were in virtuous sleep,

378
00:39:05,007 --> 00:39:08,363
the savages broke loose
their collars,

379
00:39:08,407 --> 00:39:12,320
and stole onto the deck
like creatures of prey.

380
00:39:12,367 --> 00:39:16,440
They fell upon the unsuspecting crew
with these sabres and cane knives...

381
00:39:16,527 --> 00:39:20,839
- (Gasps from gallery)
- I cannot overstate...

382
00:39:20,887 --> 00:39:23,276
(Mende) Have you
figured out who he is?

383
00:39:24,887 --> 00:39:29,005
(Mende) An advisor of some kind.
Perhaps theirs.

384
00:39:29,047 --> 00:39:30,275
..they mutilated at least one...

385
00:39:30,327 --> 00:39:34,115
- (Mende) What about him?
- The simple cook, a Creole...

386
00:39:34,167 --> 00:39:37,159
- Their own kind.
- (Mende) Theirs maybe.

387
00:39:37,207 --> 00:39:39,437
But for Senors Ruiz and Montes,

388
00:39:39,487 --> 00:39:42,160
who steered the Amistad
to these shores

389
00:39:42,207 --> 00:39:44,880
under constant threat of like fate,

390
00:39:44,927 --> 00:39:48,761
we might never have heard of
this massacre, this bloodbath.

391
00:39:48,807 --> 00:39:53,483
But for their bravery, these villains
would have escaped justice.

392
00:39:53,527 --> 00:39:56,405
But they've not. They've not.

393
00:40:00,687 --> 00:40:02,996
(Mende) And Dung-Scraper?

394
00:40:03,927 --> 00:40:07,363
I have a horrible feeling
he talks for us.

395
00:40:07,967 --> 00:40:10,003
(Whispering)

396
00:40:21,247 --> 00:40:25,160
Do you know the difference
between a cow and a cabbage?

397
00:40:26,327 --> 00:40:28,443
A brick and a bear?

398
00:40:29,167 --> 00:40:33,843
Or how about...
a polecat and a president?

399
00:40:36,207 --> 00:40:40,598
The Spanish government hopes you
don't have much more sense than that.

400
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:43,719
This case isn't about murder,
mayhem or massacres.

401
00:40:43,807 --> 00:40:46,162
It's not about anything
that dramatic.

402
00:40:46,207 --> 00:40:51,565
This case is about knowing the
difference between here and there.

403
00:40:55,087 --> 00:40:57,396
I want to show you something.

404
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:02,323
(Prisoners protest)

405
00:41:07,367 --> 00:41:09,119
Open your mouth.

406
00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:12,204
He doesn't understand.
He doesn't speak English.

407
00:41:12,247 --> 00:41:14,124
Abra su boca.

408
00:41:14,167 --> 00:41:16,044
(Replies in Mende)

409
00:41:16,087 --> 00:41:20,842
Doesn't he understand? I thought
he was born on a Cuban plantation?

410
00:41:20,887 --> 00:41:23,082
Perhaps he simply doesn't like you.

411
00:41:23,127 --> 00:41:26,005
He wouldn't be the first,
Mr Holabird.

412
00:41:34,807 --> 00:41:37,196
(Laughs) Yes.

413
00:41:38,127 --> 00:41:43,121
What, did he learn this on some Cuban
plantation, this decorative effect?

414
00:41:47,767 --> 00:41:49,678
(Muttering) Cuban plantation!

415
00:41:50,927 --> 00:41:53,839
Stand up. Stand up!

416
00:41:53,887 --> 00:41:56,879
Hey. Levantate.

417
00:41:58,447 --> 00:42:00,278
Levantate.

418
00:42:00,367 --> 00:42:03,165
- (Protests)
- Levantate.

419
00:42:04,207 --> 00:42:06,038
(Sighs)

420
00:42:13,687 --> 00:42:16,485
- Stand up.
- (All) Ahh!

421
00:42:17,847 --> 00:42:19,678
Thank you.

422
00:42:19,767 --> 00:42:23,601
Your Honour, I speak more Spanish,
and I was born in Philadelphia.

423
00:42:23,647 --> 00:42:26,719
On Spanish plantations,
slaves choose to live

424
00:42:26,767 --> 00:42:29,918
surrounded by their own ways
and simple languages.

425
00:42:29,967 --> 00:42:34,518
Pray tell, what need they know
of Spanish? "Fetch? Carry? Stop?"

426
00:42:34,567 --> 00:42:38,606
Gestures suffice for slaves,
as for any other beast of burden.

427
00:42:39,367 --> 00:42:41,278
Your Honour...

428
00:42:41,327 --> 00:42:45,718
I represent the interests
of Senors Ruiz and Montes.

429
00:42:45,767 --> 00:42:48,235
- I remember.
- I have a bill of sale,

430
00:42:48,287 --> 00:42:51,165
issued in Havana
for the purchase of slaves.

431
00:42:51,207 --> 00:42:53,118
I remember that too.

432
00:42:53,167 --> 00:42:57,479
On it, in addition to the amounts
paid for each, are their names.

433
00:42:57,527 --> 00:43:02,157
Jose, Bernardo...
Paco and so on.

434
00:43:02,207 --> 00:43:06,678
On behalf of my clients, I submit
this document to the court.

435
00:43:14,727 --> 00:43:19,005
Mr Baldwin, you've proffered
a good deal of - I'll be kind -

436
00:43:19,047 --> 00:43:21,163
circumstantial evidence.

437
00:43:21,207 --> 00:43:25,678
Have you, in addition, anything, in
the order of actual documentation,

438
00:43:25,727 --> 00:43:27,558
that might refute this one,

439
00:43:27,607 --> 00:43:30,485
and so more compellingly
support your claims?

440
00:43:30,527 --> 00:43:35,123
I'm sure I could manufacture some
as easily as they have, Your Honour.

441
00:43:35,167 --> 00:43:37,442
What you're saying is,
then, you don't.

442
00:43:37,487 --> 00:43:39,398
Is that correct?

443
00:43:47,767 --> 00:43:49,678
I have them.

444
00:43:50,207 --> 00:43:52,675
I'm afraid that does not impress me.

445
00:44:02,567 --> 00:44:04,717
I thought you did quite well.

446
00:44:04,807 --> 00:44:06,638
You do?

447
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:10,402
Much better than I expected,
to be honest.

448
00:44:10,487 --> 00:44:12,557
Well, thank you, I think.

449
00:44:12,607 --> 00:44:15,599
Although, I was concerned that
you might have forgotten

450
00:44:15,687 --> 00:44:19,805
- this is just a case like any other.
- You needn't worry about that.

451
00:44:19,887 --> 00:44:21,798
That's good.

452
00:44:21,847 --> 00:44:24,122
(Prisoner speaks menacingly)

453
00:44:40,127 --> 00:44:43,403
Hello, Cinque.
My name is Roger Baldwin.

454
00:44:43,447 --> 00:44:45,358
I'll be your attorney.

455
00:44:59,767 --> 00:45:02,486
Yes. (Clears throat) Thank you.

456
00:45:04,287 --> 00:45:06,039
(Clears throat)

457
00:45:11,767 --> 00:45:13,678
All right.

458
00:45:17,847 --> 00:45:20,680
I need to prove where you're from.

459
00:45:20,727 --> 00:45:23,844
(Cinque, in Mende) You want
to show them where we're from.

460
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:29,526
How are you supposed to tell me?

461
00:45:31,927 --> 00:45:35,761
(Mende) How can I explain
to you where we're from?

462
00:45:39,887 --> 00:45:41,400
(Both talk at once)

463
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:46,601
- (Baldwin) You go.
- (Cinque) I'm sorry, you talk first.

464
00:45:59,287 --> 00:46:03,075
Here. This is where I'm from.

465
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:05,004
Here. This.

466
00:46:05,047 --> 00:46:09,245
All of this. All of this is...

467
00:46:09,327 --> 00:46:11,795
- is...my home.
- (Mende) That's here.

468
00:46:12,607 --> 00:46:14,438
Here.

469
00:46:21,207 --> 00:46:23,482
Cuba. Cuba's an island.

470
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:37,481
The Amistad. This is where...
where you...

471
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:41,446
where everyone...was killed.

472
00:46:41,527 --> 00:46:43,802
Here. Cuba, the Amistad.

473
00:46:43,847 --> 00:46:47,237
Now, Cuba...Is this your home?
I don't think so.

474
00:46:47,287 --> 00:46:49,198
But...Excuse me.

475
00:46:53,047 --> 00:46:54,958
Now...

476
00:47:00,487 --> 00:47:02,318
Africa.

477
00:47:02,407 --> 00:47:05,285
This is your home, isn't it?

478
00:47:05,327 --> 00:47:08,842
This...is...your home.

479
00:47:08,927 --> 00:47:10,758
Yes?

480
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:13,156
You came...

481
00:47:13,207 --> 00:47:15,084
all the way...

482
00:47:15,127 --> 00:47:17,038
from...here.

483
00:47:43,927 --> 00:47:48,637
(Cinque, in Mende)
This...is how far I've come.

484
00:48:01,487 --> 00:48:03,523
(Arguing in Spanish)

485
00:48:11,927 --> 00:48:14,805
(Man) Secure the ballast, transport!

486
00:48:20,207 --> 00:48:22,163
Put your backs into it, boys.

487
00:48:22,207 --> 00:48:26,678
This is a court order granting us
permission to search this vessel.

488
00:48:26,727 --> 00:48:29,082
- What did they want?
- To come aboard.

489
00:48:29,127 --> 00:48:33,166
I informed them they needed to obtain
one of these...an authentic one.

490
00:48:41,527 --> 00:48:43,438
Aren't you coming?

491
00:48:45,487 --> 00:48:47,398
(Arguing continues)

492
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:05,443
(Man, distant) Heave-ho!

493
00:50:56,607 --> 00:50:59,075
(Gasping) My light! Light...?

494
00:50:59,487 --> 00:51:01,796
Light the lamp, Mr Baldwin.

495
00:51:01,887 --> 00:51:03,798
I'm trying.

496
00:51:07,007 --> 00:51:08,918
(Grunts)

497
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:12,118
Mr Joadson!

498
00:51:12,327 --> 00:51:14,158
Here.

499
00:51:18,447 --> 00:51:20,358
Are you all right?

500
00:51:24,087 --> 00:51:25,998
(Panting) Yes.

501
00:51:33,087 --> 00:51:34,998
(Grunts)

502
00:52:04,007 --> 00:52:07,158
These papers - and I shall
ask you to examine them -

503
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:12,440
are portions of a ship's manifest I
retrieved from the Amistad yesterday.

504
00:52:12,487 --> 00:52:16,799
At first glance, they may appear
to bolster the prosecution's case.

505
00:52:16,847 --> 00:52:18,963
You see, they list cargo.

506
00:52:20,407 --> 00:52:24,366
Cargo bearing the very Spanish names
Messrs Ruiz and Montes

507
00:52:24,407 --> 00:52:26,762
insist represent my clients,

508
00:52:27,807 --> 00:52:30,275
hand-scrawled in the margins.

509
00:52:30,767 --> 00:52:35,682
But no, this is not the manifest
of the Amistad at all. Look.

510
00:52:35,727 --> 00:52:40,482
This is part of the cargo manifest
of a Portuguese vessel,

511
00:52:40,527 --> 00:52:44,281
the notorious transatlantic
slave ship the Tecora.

512
00:52:44,367 --> 00:52:46,164
The Tecora.

513
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:48,118
(Disgruntled murmuring)

514
00:52:48,167 --> 00:52:52,240
I can bring you as many witnesses
as you wish, Mr Holabird...

515
00:52:52,287 --> 00:52:53,959
Tecora!

516
00:52:54,007 --> 00:52:57,795
Their clients trade primarily off
the coast of West Africa.

517
00:52:57,847 --> 00:52:59,838
The Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone.

518
00:52:59,887 --> 00:53:02,003
I know what you're thinking.

519
00:53:02,047 --> 00:53:05,357
Sierra Leone is a protectorate
of the British Crown.

520
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:07,318
Slavery is outlawed there.

521
00:53:07,367 --> 00:53:10,803
Its principal port, in fact,
has been re-christened "Freetown".

522
00:53:10,847 --> 00:53:13,566
How, then, can the
Portuguese Tecora...

523
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:16,565
engage in the slave trades
in these waters?

524
00:53:16,647 --> 00:53:20,083
I'll tell you how. In a word...

525
00:53:22,087 --> 00:53:23,805
Illegally.

526
00:53:25,767 --> 00:53:28,679
Whatever these men say
clearly matters not

527
00:53:28,727 --> 00:53:31,195
because this proves them liars.

528
00:53:31,247 --> 00:53:33,841
My clients' journey
did not begin in Havana,

529
00:53:33,887 --> 00:53:37,163
as they keep claiming more
and more emphatically.

530
00:53:37,207 --> 00:53:38,720
No, my clients' journey...

531
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:44,882
began much, much further away.

532
00:53:57,367 --> 00:54:00,245
I underestimated you, sir! (Laughs)

533
00:54:00,607 --> 00:54:02,518
I really did!

534
00:54:02,567 --> 00:54:06,401
- I should take that as a compliment.
- Oh, you should indeed, sir.

535
00:54:06,447 --> 00:54:10,838
I can't imagine there's no not
reaching a favourable conclusion...

536
00:54:11,487 --> 00:54:13,364
Hey! Hey!

537
00:54:14,967 --> 00:54:16,878
A-Am I bleeding?

538
00:54:18,487 --> 00:54:20,443
There's nothing there.

539
00:54:22,327 --> 00:54:24,363
What did I do to deserve this?

540
00:54:24,447 --> 00:54:27,120
You took the case, Mr Baldwin.

541
00:54:27,567 --> 00:54:29,842
You took the case, sir.

542
00:54:30,207 --> 00:54:32,880
I should take that as a compliment.

543
00:54:33,647 --> 00:54:35,683
"As you may perceive,

544
00:54:35,727 --> 00:54:37,718
"I wish you to act promptly

545
00:54:37,767 --> 00:54:41,919
"before this matter becomes
a weight on our two countries."

546
00:54:42,007 --> 00:54:43,918
Uh, "great countries."

547
00:54:44,007 --> 00:54:46,077
"Our great countries.

548
00:54:46,127 --> 00:54:49,802
"After all, the business of
great countries is to do business."

549
00:54:49,847 --> 00:54:51,758
Excelente, Su Alteza.

550
00:54:51,807 --> 00:54:54,879
"Slavery is our pillar of
commerce in the New World.

551
00:54:54,927 --> 00:54:59,443
"Without it, our goodwill
and excellent trade relations sh..."

552
00:54:59,487 --> 00:55:02,604
- Uh, "should be imperilled."
- "Should be imperilled.

553
00:55:02,647 --> 00:55:05,844
"Without it, we might
have been denied the glory

554
00:55:05,887 --> 00:55:09,084
"of aiding you in your rebellion
against the British.

555
00:55:09,127 --> 00:55:13,245
"As slave-owning nations,
we must together stand firm.

556
00:55:14,487 --> 00:55:18,321
"Speak the words of humaneness
for the masses of your citizens,

557
00:55:18,367 --> 00:55:21,996
"but hold tightly to the power
that protects them.

558
00:55:22,087 --> 00:55:24,726
"That power, of course,
is their wealth.

559
00:55:24,767 --> 00:55:28,123
"The Africans must never go free.

560
00:55:28,167 --> 00:55:30,681
"With sincerest admiration,

561
00:55:30,727 --> 00:55:34,276
"Isabella the Second,
Queen of all of Spain."

562
00:55:34,327 --> 00:55:39,196
I am not about to bend to the will
of some pubescent queen.

563
00:55:39,247 --> 00:55:42,319
Forget about them.
They're unimportant.

564
00:55:42,367 --> 00:55:44,927
- Prepubescent.
- You need to concern yourself

565
00:55:45,007 --> 00:55:47,840
with what this matter means here,
not an ocean away.

566
00:55:47,887 --> 00:55:49,764
Someone would tell me what it means!

567
00:55:49,807 --> 00:55:52,958
Leder, you yourself
said it was meaningless.

568
00:55:53,007 --> 00:55:55,123
Well, not any more.

569
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:57,558
(Sighs)

570
00:55:57,607 --> 00:56:01,043
- John Calhoun paid me a visit.
- Oh, God.

571
00:56:01,127 --> 00:56:05,040
To explain to me why this case
is of much greater import...

572
00:56:05,127 --> 00:56:09,279
- much greater symbolism, to use his
word - to the South than the North.

573
00:56:09,327 --> 00:56:11,602
If the Africans are executed,

574
00:56:11,647 --> 00:56:14,719
the abolitionists will
make good use of it.

575
00:56:14,767 --> 00:56:17,201
And yes, they will make
some converts.

576
00:56:17,247 --> 00:56:19,522
If, on the other hand,
they are freed,

577
00:56:19,567 --> 00:56:24,004
Calhoun says the Southern states
will so ally themselves against you

578
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:26,356
that you can forget
about re-election.

579
00:56:26,407 --> 00:56:30,639
- (Tuts) Over this?
- It's worse than that.

580
00:56:30,727 --> 00:56:32,957
Worse? What could be
worse than that?

581
00:56:33,007 --> 00:56:36,397
Calhoun believes, and I am not sure
I can disagree with him,

582
00:56:36,447 --> 00:56:40,838
that this could take us all
one long step closer to civil war.

583
00:56:40,927 --> 00:56:44,283
- This?
- Yes, Mr President.

584
00:56:44,327 --> 00:56:47,046
But all is not lost.

585
00:56:47,087 --> 00:56:50,841
The jury appears likely to free them,
but juries can be dismissed.

586
00:56:53,567 --> 00:56:55,762
They can?

587
00:56:55,847 --> 00:56:59,601
But I believe we must go further
and remove the judge.

588
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:01,558
(Van Buren) We can do that?

589
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:06,598
(Leder) He could be prevailed upon to
recuse himself for various reasons.

590
00:57:06,647 --> 00:57:08,365
With that in mind,

591
00:57:08,407 --> 00:57:11,444
I've taken the liberty of
exploring possible replacements.

592
00:57:11,487 --> 00:57:15,002
I've found one I strongly
believe to be better.

593
00:57:15,927 --> 00:57:20,159
He's young, which means he has a
career before him rather than behind,

594
00:57:20,207 --> 00:57:22,323
he has yet to feel the hankering

595
00:57:22,367 --> 00:57:25,677
for magnanimous last gestures
for the sake of posterity.

596
00:57:25,767 --> 00:57:28,201
And he is monumentally insecure,

597
00:57:28,247 --> 00:57:31,717
particularly about
his Catholic heritage.

598
00:57:31,767 --> 00:57:34,884
- He's Catholic?
- His grandfather was Catholic,

599
00:57:34,927 --> 00:57:39,079
which young Mr Coglin has striven
all his days to keep quiet.

600
00:57:39,127 --> 00:57:41,038
(Man) Mr President, Judge Coglin.

601
00:57:41,087 --> 00:57:44,159
(Van Buren) Judge Coglin,
we are so pleased to meet you.

602
00:57:44,207 --> 00:57:45,799
Thank you so much for coming.

603
00:58:06,967 --> 00:58:09,117
I've been reading in the papers

604
00:58:09,167 --> 00:58:13,877
the continuing saga
of the, uh, Amistad.

605
00:58:13,967 --> 00:58:15,798
Real papers.

606
00:58:15,887 --> 00:58:18,765
(Chuckles) Real papers. Yes, sir.

607
00:58:20,207 --> 00:58:24,997
(Tuts) Yes. Bad luck,
this last unfolding chapter.

608
00:58:25,207 --> 00:58:27,402
What to do now, eh?

609
00:58:27,447 --> 00:58:30,723
Which is why I came here
and imposed on you, sir.

610
00:58:30,767 --> 00:58:33,645
No imposition...really.

611
00:58:34,727 --> 00:58:36,638
(Sighs) Yeah.

612
00:58:39,207 --> 00:58:41,767
How did that, uh...

613
00:58:41,847 --> 00:58:45,157
How did that young lawyer
take the news?

614
00:58:45,247 --> 00:58:47,966
Oh, in stride, sir. In stride.

615
00:58:48,047 --> 00:58:52,165
The thing is, sir,
he did everything right.

616
00:58:52,247 --> 00:58:54,442
- He proved the case.
- Did he?

617
00:58:54,527 --> 00:58:57,041
Oh, yes, sir. Surprisingly, he did.

618
00:58:57,087 --> 00:58:59,920
Hmm. Good.

619
00:59:00,007 --> 00:59:02,760
Well, he'll just have
to do it again, then.

620
00:59:02,807 --> 00:59:06,436
But like most things, it should
be easier second time around.

621
00:59:06,487 --> 00:59:10,446
Well, I'm afraid it doesn't matter
what he does now, sir.

622
00:59:10,527 --> 00:59:14,440
Rumour has it our next judge
was hand-picked by Van Buren himself.

623
00:59:14,487 --> 00:59:16,398
No!

624
00:59:18,367 --> 00:59:22,360
I'm embarrassed to admit that
I was under the misconception

625
00:59:22,407 --> 00:59:25,877
that our executive
and judicial branches were separate.

626
00:59:25,927 --> 00:59:28,680
No more so than these, Mr Joadson.

627
00:59:29,647 --> 00:59:31,558
No more so than these.

628
00:59:34,447 --> 00:59:37,280
- So now you know.
- Yes.

629
00:59:37,327 --> 00:59:39,204
- Sir?
- Yeah?

630
00:59:39,247 --> 00:59:42,284
Mr President, if it was you
handling the case...

631
00:59:42,327 --> 00:59:45,000
Well, it isn't me.
And thank God for that.

632
00:59:45,047 --> 00:59:46,958
(Rings bell)

633
00:59:47,807 --> 00:59:50,719
- But if it was, sir,
- Huh?

634
00:59:50,767 --> 00:59:52,678
What would you do?

635
01:00:00,207 --> 01:00:03,358
Well, when I was an attorney,

636
01:00:03,447 --> 01:00:06,757
a long time ago, young man,

637
01:00:06,847 --> 01:00:11,079
I, er, I realised
after much trial and error,

638
01:00:11,167 --> 01:00:13,761
that in a courtroom,

639
01:00:13,807 --> 01:00:17,482
whoever tells
the best story wins.

640
01:00:19,087 --> 01:00:24,366
In unlawyer-like fashion, I give you
that scrap of wisdom free of charge.

641
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:30,562
I'm much obliged
for your time, sir.

642
01:00:33,007 --> 01:00:36,044
What is their story,
by the way?

643
01:00:37,807 --> 01:00:41,561
- Sir?
- What is their story?

644
01:00:43,247 --> 01:00:45,807
Why, they're, um,...

645
01:00:48,407 --> 01:00:50,398
from West Africa.

646
01:00:50,447 --> 01:00:54,122
No. What is their story?

647
01:01:02,207 --> 01:01:06,405
Mr Joadson, you're
from where originally?

648
01:01:06,487 --> 01:01:09,126
Why, Georgia, sir.

649
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:11,277
- Georgia.
- Yes, sir.

650
01:01:11,367 --> 01:01:13,403
Does that sum up what you are?

651
01:01:13,487 --> 01:01:17,036
A Georgian? Is that your story?

652
01:01:17,087 --> 01:01:20,557
No. You're an ex-slave,

653
01:01:20,607 --> 01:01:23,440
who's devoted his life
to the abolition of slavery,

654
01:01:23,487 --> 01:01:28,242
and overcoming great hardships
along the way, I should imagine.

655
01:01:28,287 --> 01:01:31,085
That's your story, isn't it?

656
01:01:37,287 --> 01:01:40,165
(Laughs)

657
01:01:40,207 --> 01:01:42,846
You and this young so-called lawyer

658
01:01:42,887 --> 01:01:45,082
have proven you know what they are.

659
01:01:45,127 --> 01:01:47,925
They're Africans. Congratulations.

660
01:01:48,007 --> 01:01:53,206
What you don't know, and haven't
bothered in the least to discover,

661
01:01:53,247 --> 01:01:55,078
is who they are.

662
01:01:57,967 --> 01:01:59,798
Right?

663
01:02:12,967 --> 01:02:16,039
Seven. (Translates into Mende)

664
01:02:16,127 --> 01:02:18,925
Eight. (Continues translating)

665
01:02:20,287 --> 01:02:22,403
Number nine...

666
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:24,324
and ten.

667
01:02:24,367 --> 01:02:27,518
Now, how about you, Mr Baldwin?

668
01:02:27,607 --> 01:02:30,075
Would you like to count
from one to ten?

669
01:02:30,127 --> 01:02:32,402
One to ten in Mende.

670
01:02:33,567 --> 01:02:35,876
- One.
- Ta.

671
01:02:35,927 --> 01:02:37,804
- Two.
- Fele.

672
01:02:37,887 --> 01:02:39,957
- Three.
- Sawa.

673
01:02:40,047 --> 01:02:43,039
- Four.
- Nanee.

674
01:02:43,207 --> 01:02:45,038
Right. Five.

675
01:02:45,087 --> 01:02:46,998
Lorlu.

676
01:02:48,367 --> 01:02:50,801
(Joadson speaks in Mende)

677
01:02:51,807 --> 01:02:53,718
(Laughs)

678
01:02:54,607 --> 01:02:57,838
(Counts in Mende)

679
01:03:01,847 --> 01:03:05,476
(Trader) Fresh fruit!
Straight from the Caribbean!

680
01:03:05,527 --> 01:03:07,643
(Attempts to speak Mende)

681
01:03:13,367 --> 01:03:16,245
(Counts in Mende)

682
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:23,157
- (Baldwin) Sawa, nanee, lorlu...
- (Soldiers laugh)

683
01:03:23,207 --> 01:03:25,323
(Continues to count in Mende)

684
01:03:48,647 --> 01:03:50,763
(Mournful groaning)

685
01:03:56,327 --> 01:03:58,557
(Mende)

686
01:04:04,247 --> 01:04:07,080
(Chanting)

687
01:04:28,207 --> 01:04:31,995
- What's happened here?
- One of them died last night.

688
01:04:32,047 --> 01:04:34,880
We tried to take the body
away to bury it.

689
01:04:34,927 --> 01:04:37,441
What do they want?
They want to live with it?

690
01:04:39,247 --> 01:04:41,317
(Chanting intensifies)

691
01:04:53,167 --> 01:04:55,044
They want to bury him.

692
01:04:55,087 --> 01:04:58,284
They have to bury him
according to their poro beliefs.

693
01:04:58,327 --> 01:05:00,557
Otherwise, his soul
will haunt them.

694
01:05:09,527 --> 01:05:13,679
# The house of Thine abode

695
01:05:13,767 --> 01:05:18,477
# With His own precious son... #

696
01:05:18,567 --> 01:05:21,365
(Singing and chanting)

697
01:05:25,127 --> 01:05:28,005
# The house of Thine abode

698
01:05:28,087 --> 01:05:31,124
# The church of
blessed redeemers... #

699
01:05:31,207 --> 01:05:33,721
If I were you, if I ran this place,

700
01:05:33,767 --> 01:05:37,965
I'd set protocol aside just
this once and let them bury him.

701
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:41,926
# I love Thy kingdom, Lord... #

702
01:05:42,007 --> 01:05:44,805
I was thinking the same thing.

703
01:06:01,127 --> 01:06:03,038
(Prisoners shout)

704
01:06:35,127 --> 01:06:39,917
(Mende) My name is Kai Nyagua...
and James Covey.

705
01:06:40,287 --> 01:06:44,166
I speak Mende and English,
his language.

706
01:06:44,367 --> 01:06:49,236
You and he will talk
to each other through me.

707
01:06:51,247 --> 01:06:54,956
- The clothes?
- And the names.

708
01:06:55,007 --> 01:06:57,919
I was rescued off a slave ship
by the British Navy.

709
01:06:57,967 --> 01:07:00,356
I never went back.

710
01:07:04,527 --> 01:07:08,281
- (Baldwin) A problem has arisen.
- (Translates)

711
01:07:08,367 --> 01:07:10,961
The judge we had,
who believed, I believe,

712
01:07:11,007 --> 01:07:14,795
that you should be freed,
has been dismissed.

713
01:07:14,847 --> 01:07:18,317
A new judge has been called upon
to hear the case,

714
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:20,164
this time without a jury.

715
01:07:20,207 --> 01:07:22,243
(Translates)

716
01:07:29,727 --> 01:07:33,003
How is that possible?
A chief cannot be replaced.

717
01:07:33,047 --> 01:07:36,403
I can't explain it in any way
that you would understand, Cinque.

718
01:07:36,447 --> 01:07:40,360
Or me, for that matter.
Only that, well, it has happened.

719
01:07:40,407 --> 01:07:42,796
(Translates)

720
01:07:46,767 --> 01:07:51,477
I am not a great orator
or advisor, Cinque.

721
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:54,127
I'm not a big man in my profession.

722
01:07:54,167 --> 01:07:59,161
I don't know if I alone can convince
this next judge to set you free.

723
01:08:00,087 --> 01:08:02,203
I need your help.

724
01:08:04,167 --> 01:08:07,045
When we go to court,
I need you to speak.

725
01:08:11,207 --> 01:08:13,038
(Speaks Mende)

726
01:08:14,087 --> 01:08:17,204
(Covey) I'm not
an advisor of any kind.

727
01:08:17,247 --> 01:08:19,556
I cannot speak for the others.

728
01:08:19,607 --> 01:08:21,916
Cinque, the others, they say you can.

729
01:08:21,967 --> 01:08:25,277
They say you're the big man here.

730
01:08:25,327 --> 01:08:29,081
- (Whispers reply)
- (Covey) I am not.

731
01:08:34,807 --> 01:08:36,923
What's this I hear about a lion?

732
01:08:36,967 --> 01:08:39,925
(Covey translates)

733
01:08:40,007 --> 01:08:43,363
They say you alone - alone, Cinque -

734
01:08:43,407 --> 01:08:46,877
slew the most terrifying beast
anyone has ever seen.

735
01:08:46,927 --> 01:08:48,997
Is it not true?

736
01:09:31,247 --> 01:09:34,000
(Covey)
It had killed several people.

737
01:09:36,367 --> 01:09:39,040
Even hunters among us.

738
01:09:39,287 --> 01:09:41,847
Everyone including me was afraid.

739
01:09:44,047 --> 01:09:46,686
I was lying down with my family,

740
01:09:46,767 --> 01:09:49,201
when out of nowhere it appeared.

741
01:09:49,287 --> 01:09:51,278
As it came for me

742
01:09:52,207 --> 01:09:55,563
I picked up this big rock
and I threw it.

743
01:09:59,527 --> 01:10:04,078
And by some miracle,
you see, I hit it.

744
01:10:07,407 --> 01:10:10,080
He don't know how
that killed it, but it did.

745
01:10:13,807 --> 01:10:16,480
(Chuckles) A rock.

746
01:10:20,007 --> 01:10:21,918
A rock.

747
01:10:36,687 --> 01:10:38,723
(Speaks Mende)

748
01:10:41,127 --> 01:10:45,917
(Covey) I received the gratitude
of everyone in the village.

749
01:10:50,047 --> 01:10:52,356
I was given respect.

750
01:10:55,127 --> 01:10:57,925
They treated me
as if I was a prince.

751
01:11:01,847 --> 01:11:04,680
They gave me
the fine country cloth.

752
01:11:14,207 --> 01:11:17,165
All these things they gave me,
I took them all.

753
01:11:21,767 --> 01:11:24,201
But I knew
I didn't deserve it.

754
01:11:29,887 --> 01:11:34,563
For when I threw that rock at
that beast...if I had missed him...

755
01:11:34,607 --> 01:11:38,236
He said he wouldn't be here
trying to explain these things.

756
01:11:38,287 --> 01:11:39,879
He'd just be dead.

757
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:46,798
Understand?

758
01:11:52,407 --> 01:11:54,238
Understand?

759
01:12:08,207 --> 01:12:10,118
I'm not a big man.

760
01:12:11,927 --> 01:12:13,838
Just a lucky one.

761
01:12:22,567 --> 01:12:26,845
I might agree with you, Cinque,
except you're forgetting something.

762
01:12:26,927 --> 01:12:29,361
(Covey translates)

763
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:33,398
The other lion.

764
01:12:36,567 --> 01:12:39,001
The Amistad, Cinque.
The insurrection.

765
01:12:39,047 --> 01:12:41,607
That too was an accident?
I hardly think so.

766
01:12:41,647 --> 01:12:43,558
(Translates)

767
01:12:47,607 --> 01:12:49,518
That wasn't bravery.

768
01:12:56,087 --> 01:12:59,443
Any man would do the same
to get back to his family.

769
01:12:59,527 --> 01:13:01,597
You yourself would do it.

770
01:13:12,407 --> 01:13:14,716
Someone said that might be yours.

771
01:13:15,287 --> 01:13:16,879
(Covey translates)

772
01:13:19,887 --> 01:13:22,162
'(Covey translates)
My wife gave it to me.'

773
01:13:30,807 --> 01:13:32,923
'To keep me safe.'

774
01:13:33,687 --> 01:13:35,996
Cinque...

775
01:13:36,087 --> 01:13:38,999
I need you to tell me
how you got here.

776
01:13:39,087 --> 01:13:40,998
(Covey translates)

777
01:13:50,327 --> 01:13:52,443
(Chattering)

778
01:13:56,927 --> 01:13:58,838
(Cinque shouts)

779
01:14:10,687 --> 01:14:12,962
I'll hit you in the head again
if you talk.

780
01:14:13,007 --> 01:14:15,646
I'll share the profit
of my harvest. I'll...
