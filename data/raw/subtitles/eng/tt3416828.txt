someone they're doomed?

559
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,520
It was just a meteor shower,
and the show's over.

560

561
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,960
Oh, quite the contrary,

569

is very disturbing.

570

Every hundred million
years or so,

571
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,550

a cosmic cleansing.

572
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,079
Before the dinosaurs,

573
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,118
there were these horseshoe
crab-looking thingies.

575
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,437
Then, at the bottom
of this mountain range,

576
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,834
an asteroid hit.

577
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,150
Boom! Bye-bye.

578
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,437
Next, dinosaurs,

The mother of all asteroids
screaming towards us.

589
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,308
Even going underground
won't save us this time.

590
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,835
Hey, that wasn't
there before.

591
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,911
And look what
it's doing to the sky.

592
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,310
No worries.
Because I've got a plan.

593
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,040
Really? To stop
an asteroid?

594
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,636
Look, the last two asteroids

595
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,711
have pummeled the earth
in the same spot.

596
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,791
And it's about to
happen again.

597
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,473
We've got to go there

598
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,312
and see what's attracting
the asteroid.

599
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,318
Once we know
why it's coming...

600
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,710
we can figure out how to
send it somewhere else.

601
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,393
That plan is so dumb,

602
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,755
I wish it had a face
so I could smack it.

603
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,955
Let me get this straight.

604
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,594
Instead of running away
from a deadly asteroid...

605
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,955
you want us to run
directly towards it?

606
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,078
I know it sounds suboptimal,
but the good news is...

607
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,435
it'll kill us
no matter where we went.

608
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,238
Well, that's reassuring.

609
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,709

we get to the crash site...

610

written in stone?

Ah, my cynical friend.

613
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,276

the face of the Earth,

614
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,078
but some escaped.

615
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,073

and we can change ours, too.

Of course we'll make it,
and we will get married.

we're just gonna

780
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,040
let her stroll

No. I'm not still mad.

how I want to spend

about that, too.

What if...

793
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,629
Ooh. I know! We destroy
the relationship, right?

794
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,392
That way we never
have to let her go...

795
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,313
and she'll just stay

get her to do what we want.

802

it's her idea.

As in, not towards Earth.

00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,949
if we can launch enough
of these into space...

851
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,515
they will pull
the asteroid off course.
