1
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:44,766
Take for instance last week.
A woman's going to visit her mother.

2
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:48,613
She has a bag of groceries
and a bouquet of flowers...

3
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:50,214
... to brighten up the place.

4
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:51,941
Mom.

5
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:58,886
Mom? Mom?

6
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:00,320
What she doesn't know is...

7
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:03,394
... three days prior,
her mother's fallen off a footstool...

8
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:07,224
...busted her head open
and broken her neck.

9
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,305
By the time she gets there,
her mother's body...

10
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:21,104
...is bloated with bacterial gases.

11
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:25,273
There's fluids leaking from
her eyes, ears, nose, mouth.

12
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:27,646
You get the picture.

13
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,720
Well, death is tragic.

14
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:35,893
But it's also big business.

15
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:49,441
Some people deal with it spiritually.

16
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:53,802
Others deal with it legally.

17
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:56,311
But what most people don't know...

18
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:58,677
...is that when someone dies
in your house...

19
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:01,854
...it's up to you
to clean up the mess.

20
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:05,891
Well, sure, the city will come
and take the body away.

21
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:07,957
But what they leave behind...

22
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,994
...is your own
personal little souvenir.

23
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:14,564
Now, most people
don't have the stomach for that.

24
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:17,099
That's where I come in.

25
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,108
Now, cleaning a body is...

26
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,939
...actually a lot like cleaning
any other household spill.

27
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,844
There are three basic steps.

28
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:35,049
First, get rid of all the bugs.

29
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:42,019
HIV, herpes, tuberculosis,
adenovirus, hantavirus, E. coli.

30
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:45,664
Now, I assume all those things
are present, so I spray everything...

31
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:50,996
... with my own personal little cocktail
of antivirals and disinfectants.

32
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:55,504
And just between you and me,
I also throw in a little Listerine.

33
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,335
The original flavor.

34
00:02:57,544 --> 00:03:01,344
It has an enzyme
that liquefies coagulated blood.

35
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:05,678
You gotta use the original flavor,
not that new blue or orange shit.

36
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,844
Well....

37
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:13,152
Tom, that's....
I-- I mean....

38
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,049
I'll be right back.

39
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:22,057
-Didn't you use to be a cop?
-Yeah. Yep, I did.

40
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,594
Didn't have the stomach for it.

41
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:31,271
So, Jeff.
Well, what's going on with you?

42
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:34,344
Well, I'm still in the mortgage game.

43
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:36,108
Doing good there.

44
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:40,013
Of course, there's Laura and the kids,
all great.

45
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,156
Laura's mom, she's getting up there.
She's been sick.

46
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:46,416
She's staying with us now
in the back bedroom.

47
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:50,119
There's some days
she doesn't come out of there at all.

48
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:54,628
Tom, you wouldn't happen
to have a card on you, would you?

49
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:59,430
Oh, yeah, sure. Sure. Yeah.
Here you go.

50
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,630
-Can I have one?
-Oh, yeah, definitely.

51
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:04,674
There's enough here for everybody.
Yep, this is good. Call me.

52
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:08,813
That's Steri-Clean. That's me.
Gee, it's great to see y'all.

53
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:14,416
Quit stalling. Get the typewriter.
Pound out a lead.

54
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,418
-How much do you want?
-All you got.

55
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,250
Hello, give me Duffy.

56
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,391
-Call the mayor a bird of prey?
-Anything.

57
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,424
How about the time
he had his house painted?

58
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:25,063
Give him the works.
Hello, Duffy? Get set.

59
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,132
We got the biggest story in years.
"Earl Williams.... "

60
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:29,631
How was it?

61
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:31,895
It was...

62
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,406
...funny.

63
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:39,840
-Funny how?
-Oh, you'll see in about 30 years.

64
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:41,673
Rekindle any old flames?

65
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:46,113
No, baby.
That candle burned out years ago.

66
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:53,090
-I'm beat. I'm going to bed.
-Good night.

67
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:55,527
You're gonna stay up
and watch this movie...

68
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:57,093
...with these people talking like:

69
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:02,628
-Yeah. I wanna see how it ends.
-All right.

70
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:05,201
Rose, I'll love you
until the end of time...

71
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:09,637
...because you're the girl I've wanted,
and you're the girl of my dreams.

72
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:11,639
Love you, baby.

73
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:13,672
-Is she there?
-No, I can't hear you.

74
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,643
-Where'd she go?
-Out someplace.

75
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:48,340
Last night--
Last night I dreamed I was...

76
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:51,574
...changing my baby's diaper,
and it was filled with blood.

77
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:55,151
And when I looked up, I mean,
he was fucking dead.

78
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:58,422
You know,
and then I had to come in and....

79
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:02,291
I had to come in and clean the crib.

80
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,396
I gotta clean it up
before the mama comes in.

81
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:08,665
You want something? Gum, mints?

82
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,836
-Aspirin?
-I could use a drink.

83
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,403
How about we start with the aspirin?

84
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:15,267
Hey, you got a little girl.

85
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:18,069
What do you tell Rose?
What do you tell her you do?

86
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:19,710
She knows what I do.

87
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:23,279
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
We don't clean up blood.

88
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:26,145
We clean up anger and grief,
heartache.

89
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:28,149
Looks like blood.

90
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,019
Just tell yourself that
our clients are in trouble.

91
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,289
We help them out.

92
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:44,193
Well, I hate to see you go, Miguel.
I don't wanna burn you out either.

93
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,100
Say you come in a couple days
a week, restock the vans...

94
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:50,207
...and give Cherie a hand around here,
lighten her load, okay?

95
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:55,042
Yeah, man. Yeah, l--
Yeah, thank you, brother.

96
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:59,582
-Thank you, man. Look, I owe you one.
-You don't owe me shit. We all good.

97
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:03,085
-Go spend the day with your family.
-All right.

98
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,587
He quit?

99
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:11,764
No. He's gonna help you out
around here.

100
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:15,456
Yeah, I'll believe it when I see it.
These two are yours.

101
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:22,269
-Forty-five cats? Give this to Paulie.
-We're short-staffed.

102
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:26,172
Paulie's sick. Freddie and Jose are in
that meth lab in Howell. Miguel quit.

103
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:27,505
No, he didn't quit.

104
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,942
And Victor's allergic.

105
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:36,084
-Hey, at least nobody died there.
-Probably smell better.

106
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,086
Good morning, Steri-Clean.

107
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,360
Please hold. Lorenzo's on 2.

108
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:45,121
-I'm in the field.
-Again?

109
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:47,094
I'm in the field.

110
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,097
You're gonna have to
take it sometime.

111
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:52,327
Okay.

112
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:55,029
I'm so sorry, Mr. Lorenzo.
He's in the field.

113
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:56,265
Thank you.

114
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,003
Can I take a message?

115
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:59,660
Steri-Clean. Anybody here?

116
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:44,915
Initial recording.

117
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:48,814
This is Tom Cutler. On April 6.

118
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:54,891
Case number three-Mary-four-four-
five-Charlie-three-seven-eight.

119
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,618
Personal residence.

120
00:09:56,829 --> 00:10:02,392
Homicide. No one home.
Key was left on the front porch.

121
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,628
Blood and tissue on the sofa...

122
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:10,001
... wall...

123
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:14,273
... tile floor...

124
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:17,606
...glass coffee table.

125
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:29,825
Blood, soft chip,
approximately one day old.

126
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,897
Something smells good.

127
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:25,509
-How was your day?
-Long.

128
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:31,879
-Why is your mom's box out?
-It's a surprise.

129
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:46,661
-Are your eyes closed?
-Yeah, they're closed.

130
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,356
Okay.

131
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:51,301
Open.

132
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:54,403
I found the recipe in her old book.

133
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,474
I can't remember,
but is this how it used to look?

134
00:12:57,676 --> 00:13:00,907
Yeah. Yeah, it's exactly
how it used to look.

135
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:05,277
-Why'd you take the box out?
-It's.... It's interesting, actually.

136
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:08,942
I have to do a history report on a
historical figure from the last 50 years.

137
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:11,419
Really? So who are you doing?

138
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:13,452
Mom.

139
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:17,790
-Your mom's a historical figure?
-My teacher thinks it's a good idea.

140
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:21,592
-She said it's original.
-Yeah, it's original, all right.

141
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:25,259
-You know who would be really good?
-I kind of already started.

142
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,735
Maybe if you have time later
you can help me?

143
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,569
Sure, but not tonight.
I have to do payroll.

144
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:35,313
I don't have to do Mom.

145
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:38,881
-Who were you gonna say?
-Nobody, no. Mom's a good idea.

146
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,620
I got a call
from your math teacher today.

147
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,782
Says you've been sleeping in class.

148
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,290
I nodded off, like, twice
because he's so boring...

149
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,520
...and he's making
this huge thing out of it.

150
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,255
Well, bottom line is
it's gotta stop. Now.

151
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:58,300
So no more of those mocha things
after 5 and I want you in bed by 1 1 :30.

152
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,233
We clear?

153
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,606
Hey.

154
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:06,205
I'm not punishing you, I just want you
to get your sleep, okay?

155
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:11,111
Now, you know
if there's anything bothering you...

156
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:12,716
...I'm here for you, right?

157
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:14,146
I know.

158
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:17,247
-ls there?
-What?

159
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:21,392
-Anything bothering you?
-No, it's the mochas. I'll cut back.

160
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:27,321
One thing's for sure.
You're just as good a cook as she was.

161
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,323
Dad.

162
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:56,026
Dad. We're gonna be late.

163
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,391
Come in.

164
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:45,442
Hello.

165
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:47,839
Surprise!

166
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:53,183
Hang on. Hang on.
It's not him. It's not him.

167
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,319
Hi. We thought you were
my little nephew...

168
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:58,149
...not that you look like
you're turning 1 0 today, but....

169
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:01,451
-Can I help you?
-Yes.

170
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:04,223
Is...?

171
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:08,693
-ls this your house?
-Yes.

172
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:13,634
Well, I'm Tom Cutler.
I run the cleaning service you hired.

173
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,808
I'm sorry. We have a housekeeper
and we're really happy with her.

174
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:20,137
No, no, no. We're not that kind
of cleaning service.

175
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:24,476
I was saying, we did a job here
yesterday and inadvertently we--

176
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:26,913
Excuse me, sir.
We weren't home yesterday.

177
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:29,383
What kind of cleaning service
are you?

178
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:33,451
Oh, is your husband home?
Perhaps I could talk to him.

179
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,628
No, he's out for the moment.
You can talk to me.

180
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:38,958
Okay.

181
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:42,333
We cleaned up
after what happened.

182
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:45,502
After what happened?

183
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:47,899
-I'm sorry, Mrs...?
-Norcut.

184
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,330
Norcut.

185
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,873
-Not Collins?
-No.

186
00:16:56,315 --> 00:17:00,649
-ls this Ridgecrest Lane?
-Ridgewood Way.

187
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,017
See. There.

188
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:07,556
There's the mistake right there. Once
again, my office got things mixed up.

189
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,694
I'm sorry to have taken your time.

190
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:25,876
Three-Mary-four-four-
five-Charlie-three-seven-eight.

191
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,177
Hey. Sign these. I'm going to Betty's.
You want anything?

192
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:35,376
I'm sorry. There are no matches
for that case number.

193
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:37,153
Who called this in?

194
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:40,086
-West Trenton P.D.
-Who, exactly?

195
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:42,283
-Right there. Jones.
-Sir?

196
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:46,288
-Detective Jones, please.
-There's no one by that name, sir.

197
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:50,161
Oh, thank you.

198
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:55,535
-What happened? They stiff us?
-I'm just trying to sort some stuff out.

199
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,072
All right.

200
00:17:57,276 --> 00:18:00,177
-What do you want from Betty's?
-I'm not hungry.

201
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:51,253
Police Commissioner Robert Vaughn
stepped down in disgrace last year...

202
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:54,626
...following allegations of widespread
corruption and bribery.

203
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,130
Earth to Dad.

204
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:58,030
The grand jury is expected
to hear....

205
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:01,798
I said, next Tuesday is
T ake Your Daughter to Work Day.

206
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:05,170
-No. Ain't gonna happen, sport.
-I'm totally joking.

207
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:43,071
Eddie Lorenzo, Line 1.
In the field again?

208
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:48,686
No.

209
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:51,119
No, I'll take it.

210
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:08,204
Well, it must be a full moon.

211
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:12,969
What the hell's going on, Tom?
You think I'd never find out?

212
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:17,377
Rosie makes the playoffs, I gotta
read about it in the sports section?

213
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,549
I'm gonna be there.

214
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:23,243
-I already marked it down.
-That would be really great.

215
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:25,514
-She'll appreciate that.
-lf she remembers me.

216
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,521
Of course she remembers you.

217
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,455
You think you'll be thirsty tonight?

218
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:31,595
Oh, I think
I can probably be persuaded.

219
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:34,129
-Vic's?
-Hey, yeah, Vic's.

220
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,427
-Eight o'clock?
-All right. Vic's at 8.

221
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:41,003
-Just like old times. Excellent.
-See you there, man.

222
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,646
She worked at a movie theater.

223
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:52,078
She used to sneak me in
and we'd watch movies.

224
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,320
Well, she'd watch them.
I'd watch her.

225
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,650
It was a very small wedding.

226
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:05,887
Just me, her, her parents,
her friend Jules, and Eddie.

227
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:11,499
We went on vacation in Mexico...

228
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:15,230
...and nine months later,
you showed up.

229
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:19,668
That's the short version,
and that's all you're getting.

230
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:21,972
How much more?

231
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,579
Just a couple.

232
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,376
I wanna talk a little bit
about what happened to her.

233
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:27,813
Where'd you find that?

234
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:32,824
It was in the box.
So, what happened to him?

235
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:37,820
-I thought this was about your mother.
-I'm supposed to be thorough.

236
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,019
He was killed, right?

237
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:45,032
-Yes, he was killed.
-How?

238
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:48,263
In prison, where he should have been
for what he did to her.

239
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,701
I know, but how?

240
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:52,706
I don't know, Rose. It's prison.
Prison's a dangerous place.

241
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:56,347
Look, I really don't think you ought to
be putting all that in there.

242
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:02,151
I'm sorry.

243
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,023
Any more questions?

244
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:11,828
That's all for now. I guess.

245
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,530
I have to go out for a while.
You gonna be okay?

246
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:20,864
Yeah, I'll be fine.

247
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,479
-Yo, Vic.
-Coming up.

248
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:32,379
-Hey, where you been hiding, Tom?
-Oh, I've been around.

249
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:37,054
Are things as bad down there
as they say in the paper?

250
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:41,214
Worse. Thirty-five guys filed
for early retirement this month alone.

251
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:44,657
Everyone's afraid they're gonna find
the trail and start naming names.

252
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:47,525
IA's everywhere.
The DA's subpoena happened.

253
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:51,066
You brush by Robert Vaughn in
the hall, they wanna know about it.

254
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:53,760
-You think he'll go down?
-You know how it is, Tom.

255
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:56,770
He's got a lot of guys around,
loyal guys. He's protected.

256
00:22:56,975 --> 00:23:00,877
When she came home,
she found his clothes and car gone.

257
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:04,310
The police have recovered his car
at the Berkeley Square train station.

258
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:07,883
But security tapes show
that he never boarded a train.

259
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:09,280
Know anything about that?

260
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:10,955
Rumors of foul play....

261
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,388
-Yeah, that came down today.
-So, what's the story?

262
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:17,426
No story.
Some guy skipped out on his wife.

263
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:19,961
-Why?
-No reason.

264
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:23,090
You better catch up.
I'm gonna kick your ass here.

265
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:24,632
I'm still working on this.

266
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:27,862
How am I gonna know what's on
your mind if you don't get hammered?

267
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:31,634
You know, something happened at
work has got me a little turned around.

268
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:34,607
Considering the work you do,
it must have been something.

269
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,570
Vic. Turn that up.

270
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:39,580
-Fears for John's safety.
-Turn it up.

271
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:41,480
What can you tell us
about Norcut?

272
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:43,916
We're treating this
as a missing persons case.

273
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:45,749
Thank you very much.

274
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:47,322
Can I have your autograph?

275
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:50,586
Man, I spoke to that asshole
for 1 5 minutes, man.

276
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:57,664
Holy shit. Here he comes, Tommy.

277
00:23:57,869 --> 00:24:00,394
-Tom Cutler.
-Jim Vargas.

278
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,698
-Hey.
-Holy shit. How you doing?

279
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:05,604
-Good, man, good.
-Good to see you.

280
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:09,542
Lorenzo.
Regular class reunion, huh?

281
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:12,114
Hey, somebody told me
you're cleaning up stiffs?

282
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:14,376
-That's right.
-No shit.

283
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:16,486
Man, I thought
they were yanking my chain.

284
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:18,155
Of all the crazy rackets, huh?

285
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:20,324
Hey, we can't all be TV stars
like you, Jim.

286
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:22,755
-Come on.
-When you go to Missing Persons?

287
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:27,026
Missing Persons?
I'm Homicide, baby.

288
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:30,599
Oh, that. That's for the press, man.
Fuck the press.

289
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,236
Technically,
it's a missing persons case.

290
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:36,373
-I'm just getting a head start.
-What makes you think he's dead?

291
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:39,772
His bags were packed,
they found his car at the train station.

292
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,673
You sound like
you know more than Jim.

293
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,542
Well, you know, the paper
doesn't tell you everything.

294
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:47,741
And I get that old Columbo feeling
every now and then, you know.

295
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:50,615
Come on, Jim, help me out.
Throw me a bone. Off the record.

296
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,983
All right, all right. Off the record.

297
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:57,389
The neighbor saw a plumbing van
there day after he disappeared.

298
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:04,000
If he'd left his wife,
why would he hire a plumber, huh?

299
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:08,536
Wow, Detective Jim.
That's some crack police work there.

300
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,867
What's your badge made out of,
chocolate?

301
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:13,010
Solid brass, Lorenzo.

302
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:15,304
You wanna come by sometime
and polish it?

303
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,641
Oh, you mean the lA's letting you
keep it?

304
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:21,612
Hey, hey, we're just talking
here, okay?

305
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:27,890
Good to see you, Tom.

306
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:30,323
Good to see you're doing well
after all that shit.

307
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,053
-What are you drinking?
-I'm good.

308
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:34,061
You good? All right.

309
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,059
Next time.

310
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:45,774
-What's wrong with you?
-He's a fucking asshole.

311
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:50,674
Wanna hear something
that won't make the papers?

312
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:53,612
-Yeah.
-This missing guy, Norcut?

313
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:55,251
He knew Vaughn.

314
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:58,217
The word is he cut a deal
with the DA to testify.

315
00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:00,357
-How'd you come by that?
-I didn't.

316
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,790
I don't know shit. All I know is,
before the grand jury convenes...

317
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:05,656
...Norcut goes missing...

318
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:08,424
...this asshole's put on the case.

319
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:15,497
But, Tommy, it was that domestic
on 36th--

320
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:19,006
Hey, hey, hey, where you going?
Come on, get under here.

321
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:22,338
-I'm not letting you drive. Come on.
-We are parked in a red zone.

322
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:25,812
That's not the only thing
that's in the red zone. Come on.

323
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:27,279
All right, all right.

324
00:26:32,857 --> 00:26:35,849
How old is my goddaughter now?
Thirteen, 1 4?

325
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:40,157
Fourteen. Buckle up. It's the law.

326
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:46,829
We're getting old, brother.
You had the right idea, though.

327
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:49,296
Family first.

328
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:54,710
Man doesn't have a family,
he doesn't have shit.

329
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:58,744
I'm doing that outreach stuff now.

330
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:02,511
You know, after-school programs?
It's the only thing keeps me sane.

331
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:06,179
-What? What's so funny?
-After school, outreach?

332
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:09,121
Who are you
and where did you put Eddie?

333
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:13,787
I'm a very complex man, Tom.
And I'm fucking starving.

334
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:16,661
-Let me buy you some waffles.
-All right.

335
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:20,930
Hey, what happened at work today
that you wanted to talk about?

336
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:23,000
Nothing. I can handle it.

337
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:38,049
Hey. Anything pressing?

338
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:40,747
-No, but--
-I'll be in the office.

339
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:46,220
There's someone waiting for you.

340
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,869
Mr. Cutler.

341
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:57,203
I'm not sure if you remember me.
You came by my house.

342
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:01,870
Oh, yeah, yeah. The birthday party.
Sorry about the mix-up, Mrs.--

343
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,104
Arms for Hope
Ann Norcut

344
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:06,181
Norcut, Ann Norcut. Not Collins,
as you could see.

345
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:08,810
Yes.

346
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:12,786
-You wanna sit?
-I'd rather stand.

347
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:14,083
How can I help you?

348
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:18,929
I asked a question back at my house
and you never answered me.

349
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:21,698
What kind of cleaning service
do you run here?

350
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:25,597
Biomedical and biohazardous
abatement and sanitation.

351
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:27,698
You clean crime scenes.

352
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:30,067
Yeah, but that's only a part
of what we do.

353
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:31,708
Cherie give you our brochure?

354
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,572
I'm not sure if you've read
your paper yet, Mr. Cutler...

355
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:36,440
...but my husband is missing.

356
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:41,079
That's your husband? I'm sorry.

357
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:43,849
The day after my husband
disappears...

358
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,956
...a crime-scene cleaner shows up
at my door...

359
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:50,457
...talking about a job he did
at my house.

360
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:53,026
What am I supposed to think
about that?

361
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:57,893
I explained to you why I came by
your house. Sorry for the mix-up.

362
00:28:58,103 --> 00:29:01,903
If you have information that'll help
police find your husband, go to them.

363
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:04,132
What makes you think I haven't
done that?

364
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:07,675
Well, if you had, I'd be talking
to them and not you.

365
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:14,344
I'm a retired police officer,
Mrs. Norcut.

366
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:17,549
In my line of work...

367
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:21,257
...I'm in regular contact
with the police.

368
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:24,654
If there were anything questionable
about a crime scene...

369
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:27,058
...I'd be the first one to step up.

370
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:33,162
Look, I know what you're
going through is rough.

371
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:34,804
I lost my wife a few years ago.

372
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:36,940
-So I understand--
-Should I be grieving?

373
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:39,440
No, no, no. Of course not.

374
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:41,271
Then why would you empathize
with me?

375
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:45,040
Well, I'm just saying that your concern
is understandable.

376
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:49,183
You said you mistook my house
for one on Ridgecrest Lane?

377
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:52,982
-What kind of work did you do there?
-I'm afraid I can't discuss that.

378
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:58,254
I'm afraid I checked, Mr. Cutler.
There is no Ridgecrest Lane.

379
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:03,195
So yes, I'd say that my concern
is more than understandable.

380
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:06,094
Look, my husband made his share
of enemies...

381
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,670
...but I have a feeling you're
not one of them.

382
00:30:08,873 --> 00:30:11,535
Please. I won't repeat
anything you tell me.

383
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:13,370
I just need to know for myself:

384
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:17,241
Did you do any work at my house?

385
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:21,449
Look, I would love to be
of more assistance to you.

386
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:23,912
And I hope the police find
your husband.

387
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:28,286
Now, if there's nothing else,
I have a really full day.

388
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,829
I'm glad you're so friendly
with the police.

389
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,983
Any time.

390
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:16,733
-Mr. Cutler. The police are here.
-Thanks.

391
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:19,034
Stay on the plastic.

392
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:21,006
Did you hear me say
stay on the--?

393
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:25,547
That's one way to skip out
on your bill.

394
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,351
You got a second?

395
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,121
Oh, what a dump.

396
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:35,156
If I was gonna off myself, I think
I'd go to the Four Seasons.

397
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,918
Yeah, a lot of people do.

398
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:40,120
I'm sorry I got a little drunk
last night.

399
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:43,198
-I know you wanted to talk.
-I'm kind of busy.

400
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:45,898
Maybe you could find some time.

401
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,437
Forensics searched the Norcut place
yesterday.

402
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:50,630
Floor to ceiling.

403
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:55,105
Not a drop of blood and no sign
of a struggle.

404
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:57,240
Nothing.

405
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:06,382
What they did find was chemicals,
cleansing agents.

406
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:08,553
Lots of them.

407
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:11,220
And I'm not talking Ajax.

408
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,423
So I hear this...

409
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,029
...I remember you asking me
about the case last--

410
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:19,795
-You following a lead here?
-It's not my case.

411
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:23,405
It's not my department. And right now,
if you want, I'm not even a cop.

412
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:29,644
The last time I asked for
your help, you almost lost your job.

413
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:31,747
Yeah, it got a little choppy
back then.

414
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,612
But I survived. So did you.

415
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:41,517
-I don't regret what we did. Do you?
-Does it matter?

416
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:45,753
-Still gotta live with it.
-Yeah, I've lived with it pretty good.

417
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:52,696
What's on your mind, Thomas?

418
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,267
And why didn't you call it in?

419
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:59,534
I don't know who Vaughn's
got working there.

420
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:02,838
I call it in to the wrong person,
I'm the one that goes missing.

421
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:06,574
-You could've told me last night--
-I tried, I wanted to, but--

422
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:09,651
I wasn't supposed to know about it,
so I decided not to know.

423
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:11,481
Old habit.

424
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:13,520
You still got all the papers, right?

425
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:16,853
Yeah. Release forms, crime-scene
photos, everything's at the office.

426
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:19,029
Hang on to everything,
it's your alibi.

427
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:21,664
That just proves I was there,
not that I didn't do it.

428
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:24,699
You were just doing a job.
No one can hang a case on you.

429
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:27,336
But I had opportunity and ability.

430
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:29,563
But not the motive, right?

431
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:31,969
We never took a penny
from Vaughn.

432
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:35,805
Right, Tom?

433
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,739
Tom.

434
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:42,647
You want me to help you out, you're
gonna have to tell me what's going on.

435
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:47,553
You ever wonder why they
stopped questioning us...

436
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:50,250
...about Hill getting shanked
in prison?

437
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,898
Vaughn comes to me, he says he can
make the whole inquiry go away...

438
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,568
...if I just do a job for him.

439
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:02,430
I'm thinking about Rose,
and she's already lost a parent...

440
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,007
...so I do the job.

441
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:08,369
Then I get tapped out
by the funeral.

442
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:12,140
I need money to start the
new business, so I do another job.

443
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,817
And another.

444
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:16,748
I shake somebody down.
Look the other way.

445
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:20,754
-Pull some evidence.
-That was years ago, Tommy.

446
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:23,290
Jury's gonna see an old soldier
marching to orders.

447
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:24,620
Ain't gonna be any jury.

448
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:28,026
Everything Norcut knew, you think
Vaughn's gonna let anybody find him?

449
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,393
-Vaughn's not running things.
-But his guys are.

450
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:32,796
This case was closed
before it opened.

451
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:34,733
The whole investigation is a show.

452
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:37,407
You remember how things were.

453
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:41,078
I panicked as she soon as
she told me her name was Norcut.

454
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:44,680
I remember the name from back then.
Norcut was the money man.

455
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,709
I looked her in the eye
and lied to her face.

456
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,114
Just straight-up lied.

457
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,889
What, Vaughn ever try
to get to you?

458
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,495
Yeah, after you left.

459
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:03,098
I told him where he could insert
his offer. I've been riding a desk since.

460
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:06,594
-The price of honor, right?
-Right.

461
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:10,602
Listen, sit tight and I'll find out
where Vargas is steering this...

462
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:12,571
...and I'll let you know.

463
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:15,311
-Eddie.
-Yeah.

464
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:18,910
Thanks.

465
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:23,417
Fuck "thanks." Fuck "you're welcome."
This is you and me.

466
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,188
I'll talk to you soon.

467
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:29,687
That's the old redhead.

468
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:34,297
No bitterness. No recrimination.
Just a good swift left to the jaw.

469
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:39,336
Oh, thank you, Edward. Come, Seth.
We have so much to talk about.

470
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,739
There's this thing.
Alexander Graham Bell invented it.

471
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,602
Things ran a little late, I'm sorry.
Dinner smells good.

472
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,802
It's not okay to leave a child
home alone. Anything could happen.

473
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:52,005
-Wanna start staying at Anita's again?
-I want you to be home.

474
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:54,582
I am home.
Hey, what's going on here?

475
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:57,720
You're the one always saying
how you can take care of yourself.

476
00:35:57,922 --> 00:36:02,188
Rose, this school project....

477
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:07,129
Hey. Hey, I'm talking to you.

478
00:36:08,032 --> 00:36:10,193
This project about your mom
got you thinking--

479
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:13,564
At least someone's thinking
about her.

480
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:48,631
Three, four, five.

481
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:59,241
Seven, eight.

482
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:03,606
Nine, ten.

483
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:10,019
I told you he's out.

484
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:12,621
-Then call him.
-Jim.

485
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,658
Is there a problem?
-Tom, how you doing, buddy?

486
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,919
This is my partner, Darrin Harris.

487
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:21,257
-I've heard a lot about you.
-Well, you know, Jim likes to talk.

488
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:22,454
How can I help you?

489
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:25,363
They wanna search the place,
but they don't have a warrant.

490
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:29,972
We don't wanna search the place.
Look, Tom, I'm in a bit of a bind, okay?

491
00:38:30,174 --> 00:38:32,472
Forensics found industrial cleanser
at a scene.

492
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:34,474
They need samples
to match them against.

493
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,203
I figured you're in the business.

494
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:39,178
-Why didn't you give the OSHA list?
-He didn't ask for it.

495
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:42,443
Instead, he came in here,
barking like a damn dog...

496
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:45,486
-...without a warrant.
-Cherie, Cherie.

497
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:49,057
-Could I please have the OSHA list?
-Of course.

498
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:52,224
Do any work in Ewing County?

499
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:56,895
No, not a lot. You know, rich people
tend to die in hospitals.

500
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:59,934
Maybe you could check Ridgewood
Way about a week or so ago?

501
00:39:00,137 --> 00:39:01,604
Last name Norcut.

502
00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:03,668
Ridgewood Way?

503
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:08,637
Norcut. Yeah, I read
about that case.

504
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:19,651
No, no.

505
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:23,759
Sorry. No Ridgewood Way.

506
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:29,255
-Think we could snag a few samples?
-Yeah, sure. No problem.

507
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:31,258
Come on.

508
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,640
It's right here, guys.

509
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:51,688
Nice ink.

510
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:54,451
-Where you get those?
-Miguel?

511
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:57,855
Would you go out to the van and get
me some of those red bags, please?

512
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:00,723
No problem, Tom.

513
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:09,404
-You ever heard of "excuse me"?
-ls that English or Spanish?

514
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:15,303
When did he get out?

515
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:18,676
Six months ago. I know his
probation officer. He's a good kid.

516
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:20,942
What was he doing
last Thursday night?

517
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:23,086
How the hell should I know?
Ask him.

518
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:26,823
What about you?

519
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:31,422
Home. I'm home every night.

520
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:34,154
Credit card records say
you were downtown at the lvy...

521
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:36,060
...Thursday night.

522
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:45,735
-Oh, yeah. High school reunion.
-High school reunion, huh?

523
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:49,003
I skipped mine. Fuck them.

524
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:51,272
-What time you leave?
-Eleven-thirty.

525
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:55,282
-Why you checking my records?
-I'm just following up.

526
00:40:55,486 --> 00:41:00,321
-What about Friday afternoon?
-Downtown. Feline infestation.

527
00:41:00,524 --> 00:41:02,583
You wanna see Polaroids
of the litter boxes?

528
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,556
Maybe some other time.

529
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:06,821
Is that it? I gotta go back out.

530
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:09,795
-No. No, you've been very cooperative.
-Make me happy...

531
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,127
...if you wrote that down too.

532
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:19,133
Happy?

533
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:21,736
As a pig in shit.

534
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:26,746
Miguel, give these guys a hand,
would you?

535
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:56,738
Oh, hey, I'm not done
with stocking this one yet.

536
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:58,539
-You can do it later, okay?
-Okay.

537
00:41:58,749 --> 00:42:01,582
Listen, my wife wanted me
to invite you for dinner tomorrow.

538
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:04,310
We wanna say thanks, you know.
And Mama can cook.

539
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:08,185
-She's always watching food channels.
-You know, I'd really like to but I can't.

540
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:11,293
-But I'll take a rain check, all right?
-All right.

541
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:16,694
Look, Miguel, if those cops ask you
any questions, don't sweat it.

542
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:20,962
-Just answer them straight, okay?
-Yeah, no problem.

543
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:26,768
-And, brother, you okay?
-Yeah.

544
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:28,205
Yeah, I'm good.

545
00:42:43,093 --> 00:42:44,321
-Come on.
-Go kids, go.

546
00:42:44,528 --> 00:42:45,961
Come on, come on.

547
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:49,830
Go, Rosie.

548
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:51,467
I have maybe a day and a half...

549
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:54,695
...before Vargas gets those test results
and puts me at the scene.

550
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:58,204
He ordered enough tests
to keep the lab busy for a month.

551
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:00,376
Hoping the thing dies down.

552
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,978
-Vargas is going through the motions.
-lf he's not?

553
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,738
Once they find Vaughn's payroll...

554
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:07,577
...and those test results come in,
I'm suspect number one.

555
00:43:07,785 --> 00:43:10,652
When they need somebody to throw
to wolves, that somebody's me.

556
00:43:10,854 --> 00:43:13,345
Not throwing anybody to wolves.
Norcut stays missing...

557
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:15,286
...they can't prove there was a crime.

558
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:18,387
Something fishy here. The wife.

559
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,723
The wife. Why hasn't she told
Vargas about it?

560
00:43:24,802 --> 00:43:25,962
Maybe she believes you.

561
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:33,337
Yeah! All right, Rosie!

562
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:40,573
Tom, you missed it.

563
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:44,211
-Way to go, Rose.
-You missed it, man.

564
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:46,889
You should have seen it.
She was great.

565
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:55,096
-How about pizza?
-No, we can't.

566
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,392
Can't. She's got homework.
I got work to do.

567
00:43:57,601 --> 00:43:58,625
I did my homework.

568
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:03,767
Another time, kiddo, okay?

569
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:06,841
-Thanks for coming, Uncle Eddie.
-You're so welcome.

570
00:44:07,511 --> 00:44:08,808
You just broke a rib.

571
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:11,641
-lt was great to see you.
-lt was great seeing you too.

572
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:18,851
She's great, man. I'll dig some more.
Give you a call tomorrow.

573
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:21,581
You think you could sit
on those hands till then?

574
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:22,816
-Done.
-All right.

575
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:25,257
-All right.
-Nice being with you. See you, Rosie.

576
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:26,861
See you.

577
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:30,522
Come in.

578
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:34,269
-Hey.
-Hey.

579
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:37,304
To Kill a Mockingbird's on 46.
You wanna watch?

580
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,442
Thanks. I'll be out in a minute.

581
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:41,302
Finish that report yet?

582
00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:43,172
Not yet.

583
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:53,180
Where did you dig this up?
This was years ago.

584
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:57,093
-lnternet.
-lnternet.

585
00:44:58,595 --> 00:45:02,554
Why did they question you
if he was killed in jail?

586
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:04,233
Well, you know...

587
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:07,302
...sometimes people think the police
can do anything they want.

588
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:08,937
That's not the case.

589
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:11,903
They questioned us,
nothing came of it.

590
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:15,169
What was his name?

591
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:16,437
The man who did it.

592
00:45:16,647 --> 00:45:18,842
It only says "inmate."

593
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:25,115
I just wanna know.

594
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:30,589
I told you a hundred times.
Daniel Hill.

595
00:45:30,794 --> 00:45:32,955
He can't hurt us anymore.

596
00:45:57,554 --> 00:46:01,820
I've driven by this church
a thousand times and never came in.

597
00:46:02,025 --> 00:46:04,118
It's lovely.

598
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:05,317
It's private.

599
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:08,588
So were you followed?

600
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,200
Who would be following me?

601
00:46:12,402 --> 00:46:16,839
-You wearing a wire?
-No. Are you?

602
00:46:23,747 --> 00:46:25,738
Why were you watching me
yesterday?

603
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:28,383
Do you have something to tell me?

604
00:46:28,585 --> 00:46:30,280
Ask you.

605
00:46:31,388 --> 00:46:33,288
Why haven't you told
the police about me?

606
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:35,754
I don't trust the police.

607
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:38,655
Look, I know your husband
was talking to the DA.

608
00:46:38,862 --> 00:46:40,796
He was gonna testify
against Robert Vaughn.

609
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:44,456
So I need to know
who else he was gonna implicate.

610
00:46:46,336 --> 00:46:48,361
Did you clean my house?

611
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:52,308
Look, Mr. Cutler,
this has to be a two-way street.

612
00:46:52,509 --> 00:46:55,000
I haven't gone to the police
and I'm not about to.

613
00:46:55,212 --> 00:47:00,149
But, please, I need to know
what happened for myself.

614
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,187
I used to come to this church
twice a week.

615
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:10,156
Once for Mass, once for confession.

616
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:16,964
That was a long time ago.

617
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:21,269
Yes.

618
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:24,131
Yeah, I cleaned your house.

619
00:47:27,211 --> 00:47:29,873
-Oh, God.
-Looked like a legitimate crime scene.

620
00:47:30,547 --> 00:47:32,572
Whoever did it had access
to the materials...

621
00:47:32,783 --> 00:47:34,808
...and they knew procedure.

622
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:38,083
-How did he--?
-He was shot.

623
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:41,584
Where, exactly?

624
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:45,323
Living room. On the couch.

625
00:47:46,396 --> 00:47:48,364
Who hired you?

626
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:51,968
That's what I'm trying to find out,
Mrs. Norcut.

627
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:55,803
-Two-way street, right?
-Yeah.

628
00:47:56,607 --> 00:47:59,701
What was your husband
going to tell the grand jury?

629
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:08,106
I think it's better if I show you.

630
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:13,386
This used to be an old fire station,
and now it's a safe haven for kids.

631
00:48:18,262 --> 00:48:20,492
That's a mighty big pair of scissors.

632
00:48:20,697 --> 00:48:22,187
Oh, that's Robert Vaughn.

633
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:25,596
He did the initial fundraising.
Without him, we wouldn't be here.

634
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:29,336
My office is upstairs.

635
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:41,249
John wrote everything by hand
so that it could be authenticated.

636
00:48:41,451 --> 00:48:44,909
He called this his
"get out of jail free card."

637
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:46,214
What is it?

638
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:49,085
It's an account ledger,
but it's in some kind of code.

639
00:48:49,293 --> 00:48:51,056
Look. These numbers
look like dates.

640
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:52,956
I'm assuming these
are dollar amounts.

641
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:56,929
But this middle column,
I don't know.

642
00:48:57,134 --> 00:48:59,261
They're too short
to be account numbers, right?

643
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:04,998
-Could they be phone numbers?
-No. Badge numbers.

644
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:06,300
Are you sure?

645
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:10,571
Yeah. This is a record
of every cop who's on the payroll.

646
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:13,611
Jesus, this thing goes back
at least 1 0 years.

647
00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:15,785
Is there any way
we can find names?

648
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:18,944
If I still had access, which I don't...

649
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:22,255
...it could take days...

650
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:25,223
...possibly weeks to match
these badge numbers with names.

651
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:28,762
Plus we don't have any evidence.
Everybody in here's a suspect.

652
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,593
All right. A couple of weeks ago...

653
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:32,666
...Vaughn came over
with another man.

654
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:36,066
It ended up in a shouting match
and I haven't seen Vaughn since...

655
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:39,674
...but after that John became
really paranoid about the book.

656
00:49:39,876 --> 00:49:41,935
He kept talking
about going to the DA.

657
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:46,047
-And who was the other man?
-A Detective Vargas.

658
00:49:48,552 --> 00:49:49,883
Okay.

659
00:49:50,087 --> 00:49:52,282
Look. I need you
to write down the names...

660
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:55,117
...of every cop you talked to
since, including Vargas.

661
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:56,656
Okay.

662
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:58,828
Maybe I can get
their badge numbers.

663
00:50:26,423 --> 00:50:28,152
Charming neighborhood.

664
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:31,987
-I been looking for a summer home.
-You got that list for me?

665
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:38,728
Marty Pappas, Darrin Harris,
Jim Vargas.

666
00:50:38,935 --> 00:50:40,698
What do you need
with all these badges?

667
00:50:40,904 --> 00:50:44,169
I met with the wife.
Seems Mr. Norcut kept records.

668
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:47,104
Every cop that's ever taken a cent
is written in a ledger...

669
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:48,675
...and listed by badge number.

670
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:51,643
Jesus, Tom. What are you--?

671
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:54,840
You know how many guys Vaughn
would send if he knew you had that?

672
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:58,021
-Let me worry about that.
-Well, take my advice.

673
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:01,190
-Forget you ever saw any ledger.
-Not that simple.

674
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:03,689
Yeah, it is. Somebody asks,
you say, "What ledger?"

675
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:08,854
-I'm in the ledger.
-Jesus Christ. So burn it.

676
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,927
It's your motive. Get rid of it.

677
00:51:12,135 --> 00:51:15,104
-It's practically got a bow on it.
-Poor woman's husband's dead.

678
00:51:15,305 --> 00:51:17,603
Burn the thing that might help her
find the killer?

679
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:19,673
What do you care?
She's some rich bitch...

680
00:51:19,876 --> 00:51:24,108
...wearing a million-dollar blindfold.
Get the book, light a match.

681
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:28,041
-Thanks, partner.
-What the fuck you call me?

682
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:33,221
Partners stick together, huh?
Partners follow the plan.

683
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:35,448
I told you sit tight,
you dig up some book...

684
00:51:35,659 --> 00:51:37,593
...half the fucking city
will kill you for?

685
00:51:37,794 --> 00:51:41,230
-Walk away, Tom. Forget it.
-Walk away? I tried to walk away.

686
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,058
From everything. From all this shit.

687
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:46,292
-And look where I am.
-All the shit. Shit like me, right?

688
00:51:46,503 --> 00:51:49,267
You pick up the phone
for the first time in how long...

689
00:51:49,473 --> 00:51:52,067
...and is it because you wanna
catch up or bullshit...

690
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:55,142
...and, you know, let me see
my goddaughter?

691
00:51:55,345 --> 00:51:59,179
No, you need a goddamn favor.
And then again.

692
00:51:59,749 --> 00:52:03,708
You're family to me, Tom.
What am I to you?

693
00:52:05,155 --> 00:52:10,058
Some fucking last resort.
You don't want my advice, fine.

694
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:13,696
Take it or leave it. But don't go calling
me partner like it means a thing.

695
00:52:13,897 --> 00:52:16,457
Scared I'm gonna find you
in the book there, Eddie?

696
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,668
Four-nine-seven-three-three.

697
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:25,741
-Here, you want a pen?
-No, I got it.

698
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:30,844
You always had a good memory.
That's your fucking problem.

699
00:52:31,548 --> 00:52:33,345
You're gonna get yourself killed,
man.

700
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:35,409
-You okay?
-Yeah.

701
00:53:37,647 --> 00:53:40,411
Oh, Tom, please don't. Just leave it.
It's not worth saving.

702
00:53:40,617 --> 00:53:42,608
No, I know how you feel.

703
00:53:43,653 --> 00:53:46,816
Tom? I can't stay here.

704
00:53:47,757 --> 00:53:49,952
Well, where you wanna go?
You got relatives?

705
00:53:50,627 --> 00:53:54,427
Yeah, but no family right now.

706
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:58,566
Here, Tom, I got it, I got it.

707
00:53:59,603 --> 00:54:02,572
I'm sorry. I'll make us some more--

708
00:54:10,046 --> 00:54:14,745
I really need to go someplace.
I just don't feel safe being alone.

709
00:54:14,951 --> 00:54:17,613
Okay. I think I know a place.

710
00:54:34,671 --> 00:54:36,662
Hey, bro. Hey, come on in.
Come on in.

711
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:38,431
-This is Ann.
-Ann, pleasure.

712
00:54:39,676 --> 00:54:41,166
-This is my wife, Gabriella.
-Hey.

713
00:54:41,378 --> 00:54:43,107
-Hi. Nice to meet you.
-This is Ann.

714
00:54:43,313 --> 00:54:44,780
-Hi. Very nice to meet you.
-Hi.

715
00:54:44,981 --> 00:54:47,142
And this is Baby Julio.

716
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:48,908
-Hey, little man.
-This one's Lila.

717
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,609
-Say hello, Lila.
-Hello.

718
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:52,117
Hello.

719
00:54:52,322 --> 00:54:55,587
-Hello.
-Put me down, Daddy.

720
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,282
Don't let that halo fool you.

721
00:54:57,494 --> 00:54:59,689
Come see my horsies.

722
00:54:59,896 --> 00:55:01,295
-Not now, mi amor.
-That's okay.

723
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:03,732
Want me to see your horsies?
Wanna take me?

724
00:55:03,933 --> 00:55:04,922
-Yeah.
-Okay.

725
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:07,194
-I'm gonna go check on dinner.
-Okay, sweetie.

726
00:55:07,404 --> 00:55:10,805
She didn't feel safe, and I couldn't
take her to my place...

727
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:12,902
...because Rose wouldn't understand.

728
00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:14,098
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

729
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:18,338
It's like you said. Client's in trouble,
we gotta help them out.

730
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:37,426
Hey. Come on.

731
00:55:41,237 --> 00:55:44,331
-That smells so good.
-Thank you.

732
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:47,635
Be careful. This is very hot.

733
00:55:49,446 --> 00:55:51,971
-Lila, honey. In your chair, please.
-No, no. It's fine.

734
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:55,208
I used to eat like this all the time.

735
00:56:02,892 --> 00:56:06,259
Hey, Tom, could you
give us the honors and say grace?

736
00:56:06,463 --> 00:56:07,691
-Me?
-Yeah.

737
00:56:11,301 --> 00:56:12,893
Heavenly Father...

738
00:56:13,103 --> 00:56:15,037
...thank you for good friends,
good food...

739
00:56:15,238 --> 00:56:17,069
...and bless the hands
that prepared it.

740
00:56:17,273 --> 00:56:18,331
-Amen.
-Amen.

741
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,338
-Amen.
-Please.

742
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:21,976
Please, dig in.

743
00:56:23,513 --> 00:56:25,743
I know this is less
than what you're used to but--

744
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:27,883
It's perfect.

745
00:56:28,084 --> 00:56:32,145
Hey, believe it or not, I used to live
about three blocks away from here.

746
00:56:32,355 --> 00:56:34,585
A studio apartment
above this Korean place.

747
00:56:34,791 --> 00:56:36,258
You remember Sun's Kitchen?

748
00:56:36,459 --> 00:56:37,926
-Yeah, I know Sun's.
-Yeah.

749
00:56:38,128 --> 00:56:39,425
-It's not there anymore.
-No.

750
00:56:39,629 --> 00:56:42,223
That whole building
isn't there anymore.

751
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:46,359
You know, if you were to ask me
back then...

752
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:48,833
...how my life was gonna turn out...

753
00:56:49,038 --> 00:56:51,097
...I would have said like this.

754
00:56:51,841 --> 00:56:57,302
Warm house, kids running around,
magnets on the refrigerator.

755
00:57:00,717 --> 00:57:02,981
John didn't want kids.

756
00:57:05,889 --> 00:57:10,952
But we almost had one recently.

757
00:57:11,661 --> 00:57:13,492
We lost it.

758
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:15,820
Sorry.

759
00:57:17,667 --> 00:57:19,430
So am l.

760
00:57:35,151 --> 00:57:37,585
What's the worst thing you've seen?

761
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:42,015
Oh, I wanna know.

762
00:57:47,397 --> 00:57:50,161
The worst thing I've ever seen.

763
00:57:52,101 --> 00:57:57,038
That would have to be before this job
when I was a cop.

764
00:57:59,108 --> 00:58:00,666
A homicide.

765
00:58:00,877 --> 00:58:05,371
Victim was a woman in her 30s,
two gunshot wounds to the chest.

766
00:58:05,582 --> 00:58:07,516
Shooter was there to rob the place...

767
00:58:07,717 --> 00:58:10,515
...victim put up a fight
and he shot her.

768
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:13,181
There was moderate blood pooling
on the floor...

769
00:58:13,389 --> 00:58:16,950
...some spatter on the beds
and walls.

770
00:58:18,895 --> 00:58:20,795
That's the worst thing?

771
00:58:22,532 --> 00:58:26,024
Down the hall in another bedroom,
there was a kid.

772
00:58:26,236 --> 00:58:27,931
Two paramedics were sitting
with her.

773
00:58:28,137 --> 00:58:32,733
She was clutching a stuffed animal,
a frog.

774
00:58:32,942 --> 00:58:36,708
She found her mother's body
and called 91 1.

775
00:58:38,214 --> 00:58:40,774
Tough kid, if you think about it.

776
00:58:41,651 --> 00:58:46,520
Six years old and she still had sense
enough to call 91 1.

777
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:49,347
But those eyes.

778
00:58:51,461 --> 00:58:53,520
Those eyes that...

779
00:58:54,464 --> 00:58:58,628
...saw something
no kid should ever have to see.

780
00:59:01,004 --> 00:59:05,202
Those eyes looked at me.
Looked into me.

781
00:59:05,742 --> 00:59:07,369
Through me.

782
00:59:09,312 --> 00:59:11,177
Those eyes.

783
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:19,882
-That's the worst thing I've ever seen.
-She was your daughter.

784
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,689
Did you catch him?

785
00:59:26,796 --> 00:59:28,559
Oh, yeah.

786
00:59:29,966 --> 00:59:31,729
Yeah, we got him.

787
01:00:02,699 --> 01:00:04,929
License and registration, please.

788
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:13,304
-ls there a problem, officer?
-Your taillight's out.

789
01:00:15,645 --> 01:00:18,307
-So where you headed?
-Was I speeding too?

790
01:00:18,514 --> 01:00:20,505
-I asked where you're headed.
-Home.

791
01:00:20,984 --> 01:00:23,111
I live a couple of blocks from here.

792
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:26,812
Look, I'm a retired police officer.

793
01:00:27,023 --> 01:00:28,718
Is there a problem?

794
01:00:28,925 --> 01:00:30,483
I know who you are, Tom.

795
01:00:48,044 --> 01:00:49,375
Hi.

796
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,972
-What happened to your face?
-Nothing, I'm okay.

797
01:00:58,021 --> 01:00:59,613
-Don't be a baby.
-lt burns.

798
01:01:08,464 --> 01:01:10,193
You're not gonna tell me
what happened?

799
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,334
It's nothing.
Your dad's a tough old bird.

800
01:01:12,535 --> 01:01:14,025
I can take it.

801
01:01:15,905 --> 01:01:18,100
-That's it?
-Yeah.

802
01:01:20,209 --> 01:01:21,676
Oh, you're pretty good at this.

803
01:01:21,878 --> 01:01:24,779
-Should I be saving for med school?
-I don't care what you do.

804
01:01:24,981 --> 01:01:27,973
What was that? What did you say?
Hey, hey.

805
01:01:28,418 --> 01:01:30,613
That attitude of yours has gotta stop.
Now.

806
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:32,412
Why won't you tell me
what happened?

807
01:01:32,622 --> 01:01:34,419
It doesn't involve you.
I'm handling it.

808
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:36,449
I thought we were a team, Dad.

809
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:39,822
What if you come home stabbed?
Shot? What if you don't come home?

810
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:41,018
It's not gonna happen.

811
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:43,494
-Happened to her.
-Think that's gonna happen to me?

812
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,328
Yes! I'm fucking terrified of it!

813
01:01:49,639 --> 01:01:53,370
Rose, that's not going to happen.
Look at me.

814
01:01:54,644 --> 01:01:58,705
I'm never going to let anything
like that happen again.

815
01:01:58,915 --> 01:02:00,780
And we are a team.
We're a good team.

816
01:02:00,983 --> 01:02:02,416
We look out for each other.

817
01:02:02,618 --> 01:02:05,610
But we don't dwell on things
we have no control over.

818
01:02:05,822 --> 01:02:07,221
This project.

819
01:02:07,423 --> 01:02:10,756
-I mean, look what it's doing to you.
-There is no stupid report, Dad.

820
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:15,226
-There's no--? I don't understand.
-I'm starting to forget her!

821
01:02:15,431 --> 01:02:16,420
Oh, Rose.

822
01:02:16,632 --> 01:02:19,863
Look, you can't spend your life
going through this box looking for her.

823
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:24,267
She's not there. She's gone.
It's just you and me now, okay?

824
01:02:24,474 --> 01:02:28,706
So let's just put this away, all right?
Just put it away.

825
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:33,746
-Rose, pick this stuff up. Rose.
-You don't understand!

826
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:36,714
-You don't understand.
-Pick that up. What is wrong with you?

827
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:39,444
-Have you lost your mind?
-You don't get it.

828
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:41,889
You don't get it.

829
01:04:58,094 --> 01:04:59,459
-Hello?
-I'm coming to get you.

830
01:04:59,662 --> 01:05:02,392
Wait, wait, wait. I'm not at the house.
I'm at the hospital.

831
01:05:02,598 --> 01:05:05,761
Vargas called this morning. He
said he wanted me to identify a body.

832
01:05:05,968 --> 01:05:09,597
The press found out John was gonna
testify. It's on the news, everywhere.

833
01:05:09,805 --> 01:05:11,898
-What hospital?
-West Trenton General.

834
01:05:12,108 --> 01:05:15,600
All right. Just stay there.
I know a back way in.

835
01:05:31,227 --> 01:05:33,752
-You all right?
-Yeah, thank you.

836
01:05:33,963 --> 01:05:37,262
-What happened to your face?
-Nothing.

837
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:49,935
-Sure it's not John's?
-No.

838
01:05:50,146 --> 01:05:52,239
His key was still on the ring
found in his car.

839
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:55,383
Anybody else have one?
Sister, neighbor?

840
01:05:55,584 --> 01:06:00,180
No one. John was paranoid.
He didn't want copies lying around.

841
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:03,324
Maybe he had one made
for someone he didn't tell you about.

842
01:06:03,526 --> 01:06:07,121
As in a woman?
That wasn't John's style.

843
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:09,321
Not making keys for them anyway.

844
01:06:09,532 --> 01:06:13,161
Look, I don't see
how any of this is helping us.

845
01:06:13,369 --> 01:06:15,701
Vaughn didn't need this
to look like an abduction.

846
01:06:15,905 --> 01:06:20,342
If he'd known about the ledger, he'd
have ransacked your house to find it.

847
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:25,071
Someone with a key wanted you
to come home to a clean house.

848
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:32,045
Arlo.

849
01:06:33,389 --> 01:06:36,119
Oh, Tom. You scared me.

850
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:41,285
-This is Ann Norcut.
-Norcut. Right.

851
01:06:41,731 --> 01:06:43,961
Wait.
Does Vargas know you're here?

852
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:46,396
I was hoping we can
get through this without him.

853
01:06:46,602 --> 01:06:48,695
He kind of needs to be here,
but I don't know.

854
01:06:48,904 --> 01:06:51,304
Maybe we could do
the paperwork without him.

855
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:54,738
I don't understand why I have to do
this. They have photos of John.

856
01:06:54,944 --> 01:06:59,142
They didn't tell you. Well, the corpse
does not have much of a face.

857
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:06,111
Mrs. Norcut, I guess
all we need from you...

858
01:07:06,322 --> 01:07:09,257
...is to identify a couple
of DMs and the wedding band.

859
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:12,552
-DMs?
-Distinguishing marks.

860
01:07:12,762 --> 01:07:15,026
If I could get you
to sign these, the top portion.

861
01:07:15,231 --> 01:07:17,256
Excuse me. Is there a restroom?
I feel faint.

862
01:07:17,466 --> 01:07:21,402
Yes. I'm sorry.
Just the way you came in, right--

863
01:07:23,906 --> 01:07:27,273
Boy, you don't get to practice
your bedside manner around here.

864
01:07:27,476 --> 01:07:31,606
-Well, how bad is the body?
-Rat food, but it's him.

865
01:07:31,814 --> 01:07:34,282
I checked the scars
against the records.

866
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:38,010
Got an appendectomy work over here.
Got the one from Bob Barker.

867
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:40,814
I got Larry coming over
to check his teeth, to make sure.

868
01:07:41,023 --> 01:07:43,048
-You know Larry?
-Bob Barker?

869
01:07:43,259 --> 01:07:45,557
Yeah. You know,
spay and neuter your pets?

870
01:07:46,929 --> 01:07:50,387
-Guy got snipped.
-When did he have a vasectomy?

871
01:07:50,933 --> 01:07:54,869
A few years ago. Something like that.
It's right here in the records.

872
01:07:56,806 --> 01:08:01,470
-Hey, I was just about to call you.
-What the hell you doing here?

873
01:08:01,677 --> 01:08:04,703
Lunch with a colleague.
Thai still good?

874
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:10,045
Yeah, but I gotta finish this thing up.
I got a good spot too.

875
01:08:11,954 --> 01:08:14,980
-Detective.
-Miss Norcut.

876
01:08:15,191 --> 01:08:18,854
-You know this man?
-No, I've never met him.

877
01:08:19,061 --> 01:08:24,931
Excuse me. Can we get this over with?
I don't feel very well. Thank you.

878
01:08:29,505 --> 01:08:33,339
I don't like this, Tom. I'm seeing you
all the time these days.

879
01:08:33,542 --> 01:08:37,171
-That's not good.
-Well, that hurts me, Jim.

880
01:08:37,746 --> 01:08:39,714
Well, here's the deal.

881
01:08:42,017 --> 01:08:43,416
We've never been tight...

882
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:46,315
...but I never been against you,
even after that thing.

883
01:08:46,522 --> 01:08:49,184
-And what thing would that be?
-I mean, so what?

884
01:08:49,391 --> 01:08:52,292
Piece of shit catches a knife
in the arm. Big fucking deal.

885
01:08:52,828 --> 01:08:57,765
Some wanted to bring you down.
Make an example of you. Not me.

886
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:01,133
He violated your family.
You had every right.

887
01:09:01,337 --> 01:09:02,770
This have a fucking point?

888
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:06,169
Point is you don't want me
against you.

889
01:09:06,375 --> 01:09:09,538
That guy in there didn't die in prison.
He's connected.

890
01:09:09,745 --> 01:09:12,873
I gotta bring all the guns.
So why don't you tell me?

891
01:09:13,082 --> 01:09:17,280
-What are you doing here?
-Lunch. You wanna join us?

892
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:21,115
-Okay. We don't have to have Thai.
-Are you fucking her?

893
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:24,793
Nothing to be ashamed of. I would.

894
01:09:25,194 --> 01:09:28,527
I'm not gonna hit you. You have
to find another reason to arrest me.

895
01:09:28,731 --> 01:09:31,598
Oh, I don't need a reason.
I could just take you in.

896
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:35,395
Sweat you out a few hours.
A few days maybe.

897
01:09:35,604 --> 01:09:40,439
Okay. So let's settle this between us.
How's 1 0 grand sound?

898
01:09:40,643 --> 01:09:43,203
I can get Vaughn
to write you another check.

899
01:09:43,412 --> 01:09:45,403
Detective?

900
01:09:47,883 --> 01:09:52,843
Nice knowing you, Tom.
Don't fucking move.

901
01:09:57,726 --> 01:09:59,626
Mrs. Norcut
has identified the deceased...

902
01:09:59,828 --> 01:10:02,319
...as her husband, John H. Norcut.

903
01:10:12,274 --> 01:10:16,506
-Jesus, what happened to you?
-Ran into a blue wall.

904
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:19,875
I called the precinct.
They told me you were here.

905
01:10:20,416 --> 01:10:22,407
I'm surprised
you remember where here is.

906
01:10:22,618 --> 01:10:25,951
Vargas is in the ledger. I don't
think he had anything to do with this.

907
01:10:26,155 --> 01:10:29,386
-You want a soda, a beer?
-They didn't kill Norcut for the book.

908
01:10:29,592 --> 01:10:32,925
She's got some guy on the side. It's
his key I used to get in the house.

909
01:10:33,128 --> 01:10:35,096
You still on the same place
on Eighth?

910
01:10:35,297 --> 01:10:38,858
-I haven't been down there in forever.
-Cut the shit, Eddie.

911
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:41,559
Oh, I'm sorry.
This isn't a friendly visit?

912
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:43,362
-Did you hear what I said?
-Yeah.

913
01:10:43,572 --> 01:10:47,008
Her boyfriend killed her husband.
What else is new?

914
01:10:47,209 --> 01:10:49,939
-What do you want, an apology?
-Oh, fuck your apology.

915
01:10:50,145 --> 01:10:53,376
-You don't owe me anything.
-I changed jobs, okay?

916
01:10:53,582 --> 01:10:55,550
I changed houses, cars, clothes.

917
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:59,312
Only thing I kept was Rose.
I'm doing a hell of a job with her.

918
01:10:59,521 --> 01:11:02,979
I didn't wanna cut you off,
man. I had to.

919
01:11:04,526 --> 01:11:08,018
Okay, I fucked up, all right?
Is that what you wanna hear?

920
01:11:08,230 --> 01:11:11,097
I just want my partner back, Tommy.

921
01:11:11,767 --> 01:11:15,567
Not for a day.
You know, not for one last thing.

922
01:11:15,771 --> 01:11:18,103
Back, man.

923
01:11:20,643 --> 01:11:25,774
-I'm back.
-Yeah? All right.

924
01:11:28,317 --> 01:11:32,413
All right, so let's shut up about that.
Where is she now?

925
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:35,089
Talking to Vargas.
God knows what she's telling him.

926
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:39,091
Can you get your hands on the book?
Then call Vargas, arrange a trade...

927
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:41,195
...give him the book,
he'll drop the case.

928
01:11:41,397 --> 01:11:45,493
No. We gotta go over his head. Cut
him off before he can make a case.

929
01:11:45,701 --> 01:11:48,067
-Cut him off with what?
-The truth.

930
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:51,296
They're gonna wanna know how you
know, why you didn't come forward.

931
01:11:51,507 --> 01:11:54,670
-They're gonna be all over your ass.
-Well, she can back us up.

932
01:11:54,877 --> 01:11:57,710
What if she doesn't?
She's probably loyal to this guy.

933
01:11:57,913 --> 01:12:00,438
-That's a chance I'll have to take.
-Listen, Tom.

934
01:12:00,649 --> 01:12:03,140
The best shot we have
is with Vargas directly.

935
01:12:03,352 --> 01:12:05,843
I'll go with you. Make sure
he doesn't pull any shit.

936
01:12:06,055 --> 01:12:09,718
We could take care of this. The three
of us. We could do it tonight.

937
01:12:10,526 --> 01:12:12,494
I'll make the call.

938
01:12:13,095 --> 01:12:15,893
I gotta pick Rose up first.
Give me an hour.

939
01:12:16,098 --> 01:12:18,089
We can make the trade
at the old depot.

940
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:21,167
He's back, ladies and gentlemen.
The old depot, in an hour.

941
01:12:21,370 --> 01:12:25,534
Hey.
What, I don't even get a goodbye?

942
01:12:26,909 --> 01:12:28,968
Bye, Eddie.

943
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:16,519
-Ann. You all right?
-How did you get in?

944
01:13:18,694 --> 01:13:24,189
Of course. I'm actually fine.
It just keeps opening up.

945
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:27,198
-So where you going?
-Nowhere.

946
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:29,462
Why's your car packed?

947
01:13:32,274 --> 01:13:37,644
I know who this key belongs to,
and so do you.

948
01:13:42,117 --> 01:13:45,746
You really shouldn't be here. Vargas
is asking a lot of questions about you.

949
01:13:45,954 --> 01:13:48,149
Eddie Lorenzo was my partner.

950
01:13:48,357 --> 01:13:51,884
He was my friend. My best man.
He's my daughter's godfather.

951
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:54,688
-Don't know what you're talking about.
-Stop lying to me.

952
01:13:54,897 --> 01:13:57,297
We need to go
to the police and tell them everything.

953
01:13:57,499 --> 01:14:01,959
Tell them what, Tom? It's a key.
So what? It could belong to anybody.

954
01:14:02,171 --> 01:14:05,106
And what about that baby?
Could that be anybody's too?

955
01:14:05,841 --> 01:14:07,832
Get out.

956
01:14:08,877 --> 01:14:11,038
Did you ask him to do it?
Is that what happened?

957
01:14:11,246 --> 01:14:14,977
He didn't do it. He'd never do that.
He told me that and I believe him.

958
01:14:15,184 --> 01:14:17,482
-Now get out, Tom.
-He's lying.

959
01:14:17,853 --> 01:14:21,983
Oh, go ahead. Call the police.
I'll just tell them you broke in.

960
01:14:22,424 --> 01:14:25,052
-I'm calling Eddie.
-Wait.

961
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:28,127
If he still has his key, he's innocent.
And I'll go.

962
01:14:28,664 --> 01:14:30,291
-Just ask him.
-Please don't do this.

963
01:14:30,499 --> 01:14:31,488
Ask him.

964
01:14:31,867 --> 01:14:36,600
-Please.
-Annie? Annie?

965
01:14:37,539 --> 01:14:42,567
-Annie, are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

966
01:14:42,778 --> 01:14:49,240
Hey, I was gonna ask you. Can you
give the key back, just in case?

967
01:14:51,553 --> 01:14:56,855
-Okay, good. Okay, no, that's all.
-Well?

968
01:14:59,061 --> 01:15:01,393
He already threw it away.

969
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:16,334
You should've seen him, Tom.
He was so happy when I told him.

970
01:15:16,545 --> 01:15:21,676
He said it was a girl and he ran out
and bought all these presents.

971
01:15:22,217 --> 01:15:24,777
But I couldn't tell John.

972
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:29,914
So I told Ed that I had a miscarriage,
but he didn't believe me.

973
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:32,753
He thought John forced me.

974
01:15:33,095 --> 01:15:36,121
-We have to tell the police.
-No.

975
01:15:36,331 --> 01:15:40,734
Tom, just give me the key.
Nobody needs to know about this.

976
01:15:41,236 --> 01:15:44,000
If you go to the police,
I'll deny it and so will he.

977
01:15:44,573 --> 01:15:46,666
That's a chance I have to take.

978
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:50,504
Tom, please don't be so naive.
We all have secrets.

979
01:15:53,081 --> 01:15:55,641
I'm tired of keeping secrets.

980
01:16:04,593 --> 01:16:08,427
I have to see someone. It may take a
while, so I need you to stay at Anita's.

981
01:16:08,897 --> 01:16:11,559
-I don't need a babysitter.
-I called. She's expecting you.

982
01:16:11,767 --> 01:16:15,259
-Dad.
-Look. No arguments, please?

983
01:16:16,972 --> 01:16:20,032
Hey, hey, hey. No hug?

984
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:27,572
Love you.

985
01:16:41,196 --> 01:16:43,391
Yes, Detective Vargas, please.

986
01:17:18,734 --> 01:17:21,498
-Where's Lorenzo?
-He'll be here.

987
01:17:24,006 --> 01:17:25,633
Look, relax, Tom.

988
01:17:26,942 --> 01:17:31,311
We got three units covering the road
in. Two more down on the tracks.

989
01:17:31,513 --> 01:17:32,946
No way he's getting out of here.

990
01:17:40,389 --> 01:17:44,450
I know it doesn't feel like it right now,
but you're doing the right thing.

991
01:17:45,027 --> 01:17:47,188
He may be your buddy,
but he's made some mistakes.

992
01:17:47,796 --> 01:17:51,323
-Best to let the law handle it from here.
-Save that shit for the TV cameras.

993
01:17:51,533 --> 01:17:55,469
We both know why you're here.
You're saving Robert Vaughn's ass.

994
01:17:57,406 --> 01:17:59,374
Fair enough.

995
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:03,243
You got that ledger?
We'll get Lorenzo.

996
01:18:03,445 --> 01:18:05,606
This goes away.
You go on with your life.

997
01:18:05,814 --> 01:18:09,978
-You'll get it when he's in custody.
-Fair enough, okay.

998
01:18:15,223 --> 01:18:17,487
Rose, I thought I told you
to go to Anita's.

999
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:20,423
Oh, it's okay. I'm not alone.
Uncle Eddie's here.

1000
01:18:23,899 --> 01:18:26,197
-Put him on.
-Okay. Uncle Eddie?

1001
01:18:27,636 --> 01:18:32,573
Hey, Tom. Running a little late.
We need to talk.

1002
01:18:32,774 --> 01:18:37,336
Come alone.
Yeah, great. See you soon.

1003
01:18:45,253 --> 01:18:47,744
Tom, where you going?

1004
01:19:02,437 --> 01:19:05,463
-Hey, here he is.
-Hey, Dad.

1005
01:19:06,174 --> 01:19:10,110
-Rosie insisted on making dinner.
-Rose, I want you to go next door.

1006
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:12,906
Now.

1007
01:19:13,448 --> 01:19:15,416
I got one ready for you.

1008
01:19:16,451 --> 01:19:18,578
-Dad.
-That's okay, Rosie. Take it easy.

1009
01:19:19,254 --> 01:19:21,779
Everything's all right. He just had
a hard week at work.

1010
01:19:21,990 --> 01:19:25,084
We're gonna sit, have dinner,
talk things over so everybody knows...

1011
01:19:25,293 --> 01:19:28,421
-...what's going on here.
-Next door, Rose. Now.

1012
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:34,291
All you had to do was show up,
do your job and go home.

1013
01:19:34,503 --> 01:19:36,368
-I had it all figured out.
-You set me up.

1014
01:19:36,571 --> 01:19:39,233
I had you protected.
I was protecting both of you.

1015
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:42,410
-I couldn't let her come and see that.
-You call this protection?

1016
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:45,239
I needed you to back off.
You know, I'm sorry.

1017
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:47,972
-I should have known better.
-Come on, let's go.

1018
01:19:48,183 --> 01:19:51,584
What are you doing to me? Wait.
Listen, we could still do this.

1019
01:19:52,187 --> 01:19:55,520
Get Vargas on the phone. We can
hammer out some kind of angle.

1020
01:19:55,724 --> 01:20:00,024
-I don't work like that anymore.
-You take some oath as a janitor?

1021
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:02,787
Stop it.

1022
01:20:03,298 --> 01:20:06,290
Okay. I see how it is now.
Anything goes when it's good for you.

1023
01:20:06,501 --> 01:20:09,993
But when I need help?
Where was that conscience of yours...

1024
01:20:10,205 --> 01:20:14,039
...when Daniel Hill was bleeding
to death in the prison yard, huh?

1025
01:20:14,609 --> 01:20:16,941
That keep you up too?

1026
01:20:18,313 --> 01:20:21,214
No, you were fucking
sleeping like a baby.

1027
01:20:30,859 --> 01:20:32,884
Check your loyalties, buddy.

1028
01:20:33,094 --> 01:20:35,585
-You owe me.
-Put the gun away, Eddie.

1029
01:20:35,797 --> 01:20:39,426
Norcut was a fucking murderer.
Period.

1030
01:20:39,634 --> 01:20:43,798
-Who'd he kill, Eddie? Nobody.
-No, not nobody. He made her do it.

1031
01:20:46,007 --> 01:20:48,339
-He made her kill her own baby.
-She lied to you.

1032
01:20:48,543 --> 01:20:51,603
You think I can't have
what you have?

1033
01:20:51,813 --> 01:20:54,475
She was gonna have our child,
but he bought her off.

1034
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:57,481
Just like he buys everybody off.
He tried to buy me off.

1035
01:20:57,686 --> 01:21:00,177
-Put the piece away.
-Remember that night I went there?

1036
01:21:00,388 --> 01:21:03,221
He tried to write a check
so I would leave.

1037
01:21:04,459 --> 01:21:06,791
A check.

1038
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:13,266
She was gonna have a baby with me.
Tommy, with me.

1039
01:21:13,668 --> 01:21:17,604
-She was gonna have our child.
-Stop waving your gun in my house.

1040
01:21:20,809 --> 01:21:23,334
She was gonna have our child.

1041
01:21:25,347 --> 01:21:29,340
I had no choice.
Man is allowed to do anything...

1042
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:32,714
...if he's protecting his family.
You know I'm right, Tom.

1043
01:21:36,191 --> 01:21:38,421
Still family here?

1044
01:21:39,728 --> 01:21:41,889
We still family?

1045
01:21:46,501 --> 01:21:48,492
It's over, Eddie.

1046
01:21:50,071 --> 01:21:52,232
Oh, God.

1047
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:56,377
Who's gonna clean you up, Tom?

1048
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:14,952
Thanks. I'll burn this book
and we'll all sleep better.

1049
01:23:28,203 --> 01:23:31,798
Go on, Tom. We'll clean this up.

1050
01:23:37,178 --> 01:23:39,169
Most people don't know this.

1051
01:23:39,381 --> 01:23:43,044
But when someone dies
in your house and leaves a mess...

1052
01:23:43,551 --> 01:23:46,679
...it's up to the family to clean it up.

1053
01:23:47,455 --> 01:23:51,118
Most people don't have the stomach
for that kind of thing.

1054
01:23:51,693 --> 01:23:53,820
That's where my dad comes in.

1055
01:23:56,064 --> 01:23:59,329
My dad says
that stains have memories.

1056
01:23:59,801 --> 01:24:05,205
They remember their shape,
their color, their smell.

1057
01:24:06,741 --> 01:24:11,644
And the really deep ones
return again and again.

1058
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:23,347
With these stains, it's easier
to start over than to try cleaning them.

1059
01:24:25,293 --> 01:24:30,196
Sometimes you have a choice.
Sometimes you don't.

1060
01:24:32,133 --> 01:24:35,762
All you can do is hope.
