1
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,443
<i>Once upon a time,
in a far off kingdom,</i>

2
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,410
<i>there lay a small village
at the edge of the woods.</i>

3
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,366
I wish

4
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,124
<i>And in this village...</i>

5
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,890
<i>More than anything</i>

6
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,724
...lived a young maiden...

7
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,441
<i>More than life
More than jewels</i>

8
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,049
<i>...a carefree young lad...</i>

9
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,565
I wish

10
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,684
<i>More than life</i>

11
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,287
<i>...and a childless baker...</i>

12
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,806
I wish

13
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,325
<i>...with his wife.</i>

14
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,528
<i>- More than anything
- More than the moon</i>

15
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,721
<i>I wish</i>

16
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,643
<i>The King is giving a Festival</i>

17
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,800
<i>More than life</i>

18
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,841
<i>I wish</i>

19
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,921
<i>I wish to go to the Festival</i>

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
<i>More than riches</i>

21
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,041
<i>And the Ball</i>

22
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,451
<i>I wish my cow would give us some milk</i>

23
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,126
<i>- More than anything
- I wish we had a child</i>

24
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,327
<i>Please, pal</i>

25
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,084
<i>I want a child</i>

26
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,770
<i>I wish to go to the Festival</i>

27
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,331
<i>I wish you'd give us some milk
or even cheese</i>

28
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,561
<i>I wish</i>

29
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,369
<i>You wish to go to the Festival?</i>

30
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,329
<i>The poor girl's
parents had died.</i>

31
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,084
<i>You, Cinderella,
the Festival?</i>

32
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,969
<i>You wish to go to the Festival?</i>

33
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,124
<i>The Festival?
The King's Festival?</i>

34
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,850
<i>And now
she lived with her stepmother.</i>

35
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,963
The Festival? Ha!

36
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,847
<i>Who had
two daughters of her own.</i>

37
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,440
<i>- Look at your nails
- Look at your dress</i>

38
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,130
<i>- People would laugh at you
- Nevertheless</i>

39
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,044
<i>She still wants to go to the Festival</i>

40
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,406
<i>And dance before the Prince</i>

41
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,887
<i>All three
were beautiful of face,</i>

42
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,042
<i>but vile and black of heart.</i>

43
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,725
<i>The young lad had no father,
and his mother...</i>

44
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,801
I wish

45
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,644
<i>...well,
she was at her wits' end.</i>

46
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,167
<i>I wish my son were not a fool</i>

47
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,800
<i>I wish my house was not a mess</i>

48
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,804
<i>I wish the cow was full of milk</i>

49
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,649
<i>I wish the walls were full of gold</i>

50
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,127
<i>I wish a lot of things</i>

51
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,847
Oh! What in heaven's name
are you doing with the cow

52
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,331
inside the house?

53
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,686
I thought if he were nice and warm,

54
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,285
he might produce some milk.

55
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,124
It's a she!

56
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,329
How many times do
I have to tell you that

57
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,289
only "she" s can give milk?

58
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,207
<i>And then,
there was a hungry little girl,</i>

59
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,925
<i>who always wore a red cape.</i>

60
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,001
Hey!

61
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,286
I wish

62
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,570
<i>It's not for me
It's for my granny in the woods</i>

63
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,010
<i>A loaf of bread Please</i>

64
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,165
<i>To bring my poor old hungry granny
In the woods</i>

65
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,324
<i>Just a loaf of bread
Please</i>

66
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,647
Cinderella.

67
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,366
If you can pick up these lentils,

68
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,283
and finish your chores in time,

69
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,169
then you may go to the Ball with us.

70
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,401
Come along, ladies.

71
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,523
Yes, Mother.

72
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,361
Good luck.

73
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,246
<i>Come, little birds</i>

74
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,562
<i>Down from the eaves and the leaves</i>

75
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,042
<i>Over fields, out of castles and ponds</i>

76
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,130
<i>No, squeeze, pal</i>

77
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,650
<i>Quick, little birds
Flick through the ashes</i>

78
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,371
<i>Pick and peck, but swiftly
Sift through the ashes</i>

79
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,363
<i>Into the pot</i>

80
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,961
Oh!

81
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,041
Bull's-eye!

82
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,650
What are you doing?

83
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,400
Stop your pretending!

84
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,644
Now listen to me well, son.

85
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,768
Milky-White must be taken to market.

86
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,371
Mother, no!
He's the best cow in the world!

87
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,126
Was. She has been dry for weeks now.

88
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,647
We've no food or money
and no choice but to sell her.

89
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,285
But Milky-White's my best friend!

90
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,487
Look at her!

91
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,121
<i>There are bugs on her dugs</i>

92
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,011
<i>There are flies in her eyes</i>

93
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,642
<i>There's a lump on her rump
Big enough to be a hump</i>

94
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,007
- But, <i>Mother...
- We've no time to sit and dither</i>

95
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,091
<i>While her withers wither with her</i>

96
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,445
<i>And no one keeps a cow for a friend</i>

97
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,729
Sometimes I wonder
what's going on in that head of yours.

98
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,325
<i>Into the woods,
it's time to go</i>

99
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,243
<i>I hate to leave, I have to, though</i>

100
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,925
<i>Into the woods, it's time and so</i>

101
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,963
<i>- I must begin my journey</i>
- Uh-uh-uh-uh!

102
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,724
<i>Into the woods and through the trees</i>

103
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,643
<i>To where I am expected, ma'am</i>

104
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,524
<i>Into the woods, to Grandmother's house</i>

105
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,250
- Stop it.
- I can't just...

106
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,289
<i>Into the woods,
to Grandmother's house</i>

107
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,851
Are you certain of your way?

108
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,368
<i>The way is clear
The light is good</i>

109
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,127
<i>I have no fear
Nor no one should</i>

110
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,762
<i>The woods are just trees
The trees are just wood</i>

111
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,606
<i>I sort of hate to ask it
But do you have a basket?</i>

112
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,727
Yes, we do.

113
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,167
I don't suppose you're planning
on buying any of these?

114
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,568
Oh, shh.
Now, don't stray and be late, all right?

115
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,007
You might save some of those sweets
for Granny.

116
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,691
- Oh, my...
- Just leave it.

117
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,046
She's a thief!

118
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,209
<i>Into the woods and down the dell</i>

119
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,720
<i>The path is straight, I know it well</i>

120
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,724
<i>Into the woods, and who can tell</i>

121
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,643
<i>What's waiting on the journey</i>

122
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,524
<i>Into the woods to bring some bread</i>

123
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,443
<i>To Granny who is sick in bed</i>

124
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,250
<i>Never can tell what lies ahead</i>

125
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,721
<i>For all that I know, she's already dead</i>

126
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,888
<i>But into the woods</i>

127
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,566
<i>Into the woods
Into the woods, to Grandmother's house</i>

128
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,722
<i>And home before dark</i>

129
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,850
Cinderella!

130
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,365
Get up here!

131
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,047
<i>Fly, birds
Back to the sky</i>

132
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,526
We're waiting!

133
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,608
<i>Back to the eaves and the leaves</i>

134
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,045
<i>And the fields and the...</i>

135
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,089
<i>Hurry up and do my hair, Cinderella</i>

136
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,810
<i>Are you really wearing that?</i>

137
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,322
<i>Here, I found a little tear, Cinderella</i>

138
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,686
<i>Can't you hide it with a hat?</i>

139
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,087
<i>- You look beautiful</i>
- I <i>know.</i>

140
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,651
- She means me.
- No, she didn't.

141
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,808
<i>Mother said be good
Father said be nice</i>

142
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,325
<i>That was always their advice</i>

143
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,847
<i>So be nice, Cinderella
Good Cinderella</i>

144
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,684
<i>- Nice good, good nice
- Tighter!</i>

145
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,000
<i>What's the good of being good</i>

146
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,166
<i>If everyone is blind</i>

147
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,244
<i>Always leaving you behind
Never mind, Cinderella</i>

148
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,841
<i>Kind Cinderella
Nice, good, nice, kind, good, nice</i>

149
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,921
Ow!

150
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,921
Not that tight!
Clod!

151
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,521
Who might that be?

152
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,206
We've sold our last loaf of bread!

153
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,601
It's the Witch from next door.

154
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,569
We have no bread.

155
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,006
I don't want your bread.

156
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,525
Then what is it you wish?

157
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,286
It's not what I wish.
It's what you wish.

158
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,528
Nothing cooking in that belly now,
is there?

159
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,201
And there will never be.

160
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,846
Unless

161
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,160
you do exactly as I say.

162
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,527
In three days' time,
a Blue Moon will appear.

163
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,369
Only then can
the curse be undone.

164
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,570
What curse?

165
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,049
The one I placed on this house.

166
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,645
What are you talking about?

167
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,764
In the past,

168
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,048
when you were
no more than a babe,

169
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,285
your father brought his young wife
and you to this cottage.

170
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,162
They were a lovely couple.

171
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,001
But not lovely neighbors.

172
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,041
You see, your mother was with child,

173
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,403
and she developed an unusual appetite.

174
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,128
She admired my beautiful garden,

175
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,163
and she told your father

176
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,527
that what she wanted

177
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,331
more than anything in the world...

178
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,290
<i>Was greens, greens
Nothing but greens</i>

179
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,920
<i>Parsley, peppers, cabbages and celery</i>

180
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,282
<i>Asparagus and watercress
And fiddleferns and lettuce</i>

181
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,125
<i>He said, "All right"
But it wasn't, quite</i>

182
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,521
<i>'Cause I caught him in the autumn
In my garden one night</i>

183
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,890
<i>He was robbing me
Raping me</i>

184
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,611
<i>Rooting through my rutabaga
Raiding my arugula</i>

185
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,445
<i>And ripping up the rampion
My champion, my favorite</i>

186
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,490
I should've laid a spell
on him right there.

187
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,761
I could've turned him into stone.

188
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,970
Or a dog.

189
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,805
Or a chair.

190
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,246
<i>But I let him have the rampion</i>

191
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,560
<i>I'd lots to spare</i>

192
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,166
<i>In return, however
I said, "Fair is fair</i>

193
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,284
<i>"You can let me have the baby
That your wife will bear</i>

194
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,690
<i>"And we'll call it square"</i>

195
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,326
I had a brother?

196
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,327
No.

197
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,723
But you had a sister.

198
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,850
Where is she?

199
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,521
She's mine now,

200
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,489
and you'll never find her.

201
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,203
A small price to pay
for what else your father stole from me.

202
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,280
It cost me my youth, my beauty.

203
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,290
My mother warned me

204
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,570
she would punish me with the curse
of ugliness if I ever lost any of them.

205
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,765
Lost what?

206
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,841
<i>The beans</i>

207
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,684
- Beans?
<i>- The special beans</i>

208
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,161
<i>I let him go
I didn't know he'd stolen my beans</i>

209
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,126
<i>I was watching him crawl
Back over the wall</i>

210
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,770
<i>When bang, crash
A lightning flash</i>

211
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,922
<i>Well, that's another story
Never mind, anyway</i>

212
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,890
<i>At last, the big day came
I made my claim</i>

213
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,281
<i>"Oh, don't take away the baby"
They shrieked and squeaked</i>

214
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,524
<i>But I did, and I hid her
Where she'll never be reached</i>

215
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,921
<i>Your father cried
And your mother died</i>

216
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,481
<i>When for extra measure
I admit, it was a pleasure</i>

217
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,405
<i>I said, "Sorry,
I'm still not mollified"</i>

218
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,608
<i>And I laid a little spell on them</i>

219
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,366
You, too, son.

220
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,124
That your family tree would always be

221
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,130
a barren one.

222
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,451
Oh!

223
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,010
How could you do that?

224
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,049
And when your mother died,

225
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,328
your father deserted you.

226
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,849
Your father was no father,

227
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,208
so why should you be?

228
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,560
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

229
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,126
<i>Now there's no more fuss
And there's no more scenes</i>

230
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,965
<i>And my garden thrives
You should see my nectarines</i>

231
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,202
<i>But I'm telling you the same
I tell kings and queens</i>

232
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,449
<i>Don't ever, never, ever
Mess around with my greens</i>

233
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,969
<i>Especially the beans</i>

234
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,440
Yeah, but why do we
have to go to the next village?

235
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,845
Because everyone in this village knows

236
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,720
the cow hasn't given
a drop of milk in weeks.

237
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,921
But that's cheating.

238
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,684
We're starving, Jack!

239
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,723
Don't you understand that?

240
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,368
Now, you're not to accept
less than five pounds for her.

241
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,725
Are you listening to me?

242
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,847
Yes.

243
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,160
How much are you to ask?

244
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,890
No more than five pounds.

245
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,042
- Less than five!
- Than five!

246
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,289
<i>Into the woods,
the time is now</i>

247
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,283
<i>We have to live, I don't care how</i>

248
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,084
<i>Into the woods to sell the cow</i>

249
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,162
<i>You must begin the journey</i>

250
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,044
<i>Straight through the woods,
and don't delay</i>

251
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,884
<i>We have to face the marketplace</i>

252
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,731
<i>Into the woods to journey's end</i>

253
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,451
<i>Into the woods to sell a friend</i>

254
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,410
You wish to have the curse reversed?

255
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,366
I'll need a certain potion first.

256
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,410
Go to the wood and bring me back...

257
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,401
One, the cow as white as milk.

258
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,561
Two, the cape as red as blood.

259
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,566
Three, the hair as yellow as corn.

260
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,004
Four, the slipper as pure as gold.

261
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,809
Bring me these

262
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,726
before the chime of midnight
in three days' time.

263
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,690
'Tis then the Blue Moon reappears,

264
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,083
which comes but once
each hundred years.

265
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,607
Bring them and I guarantee

266
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,526
a child as perfect as child can be.

267
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,761
Oh!

268
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,366
Go to the wood!

269
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,041
Whoa!

270
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,604
Ladies, our carriage awaits!

271
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,128
<i>Now may I go
to the Festival?</i>

272
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,406
<i>The Festival?</i>

273
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,528
<i>Darling, those nails
Darling, those clothes</i>

274
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,489
<i>The lentils are one thing
But darling, with those</i>

275
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,409
<i>You'd make us the fools of the Festival</i>

276
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,528
<i>And mortify the Prince</i>

277
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,124
The Festival lasts three nights.

278
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,160
Surely, you can let me be there
for one of them.

279
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,921
The King is trying to find his son a wife,
not a scullery maid!

280
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,528
We must be gone!

281
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,561
Oh!

282
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,081
Stop it!

283
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,287
Come on.

284
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,771
Go!

285
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,086
I wish...

286
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,005
Look what I found. Here, take this.

287
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,687
I'm not wearing that.

288
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,211
- Why?
- It was my father's.

289
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,200
You heard what she said.
This is all his fault.

290
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,480
I want nothing to do with him.

291
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,521
Beans?

292
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,248
Oh, these must be the Witch's beans.

293
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,765
We'll take them with us.

294
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,365
- We?
- Yes.

295
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,682
We? You're not coming.
It's not safe out there.

296
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,126
I can help you!

297
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,521
No, I can do this on my own.

298
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,570
<i>The spell is on my house
Only I can lift the spell</i>

299
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,643
<i>No, no, the spell is on our house</i>

300
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,210
<i>We must lift the spell together</i>

301
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,805
<i>The spell is on our house</i>

302
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,962
Now, remind me,
what am I to return with?

303
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,565
You don't remember?

304
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,845
<i>The cow as white as milk
The cape as red as blood</i>

305
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,685
<i>The hair as yellow as corn
The slipper as pure as gold</i>

306
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,286
<i>The cow as white as milk
The cape as red as blood</i>

307
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,608
<i>The hair as yellow as corn
The slipper as pure as gold</i>

308
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,286
<i>I still wish to go to the Festival</i>

309
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,642
<i>But how am I ever to get to the Festival?</i>

310
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,529
<i>I know,
I'll visit Mother's grave</i>

311
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,720
<i>The grave at the willow tree</i>

312
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,446
<i>And tell her I just want to go
To the King's Festival</i>

313
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,443
<i>Into the woods, it's time to go</i>

314
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,249
<i>It may be all in vain, you know</i>

315
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,847
<i>Into the woods, but even so
I have to take the journey</i>

316
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,327
<i>Into the woods, the path is straight
You know it well</i>

317
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,641
<i>But who can tell?</i>

318
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,246
<i>Into the woods to lift the spell</i>

319
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,927
<i>Into the woods to visit Mother</i>

320
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,321
<i>Into the woods to sell the cow</i>

321
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,289
<i>To get the money</i>

322
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,363
<i>To go to the Festival</i>

323
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,931
<i>Into the woods, to Grandmother's house</i>

324
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,611
<i>Into the woods, to Grandmother's house</i>

325
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,090
<i>The way is clear</i>

326
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,810
<i>The light is good</i>

327
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,282
<i>I have no fear
Nor no one should</i>

328
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,842
<i>The woods are just trees
The trees are just wood</i>

329
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,490
No need to <i>be</i> afraid there

330
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,842
<i>There's something in the glade there</i>

331
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,604
<i>Into the woods without delay</i>

332
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,489
<i>But careful not to lose the way</i>

333
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,210
<i>Into the woods, who knows what may</i>

334
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,169
<i>Be lurking on the journey</i>

335
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,845
<i>Into the woods to get the thing</i>

336
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,524
<i>That makes it worth the journeying</i>

337
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,291
<i>Into the woods to see the King</i>

338
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,249
<i>- To sell the cow
- To make the potion</i>

339
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,004
<i>To see, to sell
To get, to bring</i>

340
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,810
<i>To make, to lift
To go to the Festival</i>

341
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,881
<i>Into the woods</i>

342
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,007
<i>To see, to sell, to get, to bring</i>

343
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,445
<i>- Into the woods
- To make, to lift, to go to the Festival</i>

344
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,002
<i>Into the woods
Into the woods</i>

345
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,685
<i>Into the woods
Then out of the woods</i>

346
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,490
<i>To see, to sell
To get, to bring</i>

347
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,449
<i>To make, to lift
To go to the Festival</i>

348
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,011
<i>Into the woods
Then out of the woods</i>

349
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,202
<i>And home before dark</i>

350
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,246
<i>Deep within the woods</i>

351
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,560
<i>Cinderella had planted a branch
at the grave of her mother.</i>

352
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,248
<i>And she visited there so often,
and wept so much</i>

353
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,085
<i>that her tears watered it</i>

354
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,244
<i>until it had become a magnificent tree.</i>

355
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,890
I wish...

356
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,324
<i>What is it that you wish, child?</i>

357
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,805
<i>Do you know
what you wish?</i>

358
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,402
<i>Are you certain what you wish
ls what you want?</i>

359
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,166
<i>If you know what you want</i>

360
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,846
<i>Then make a wish</i>

361
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,767
<i>Ask the tree</i>

362
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:24,689
<i>And you shall have your wish</i>

363
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,843
Thank you, Mother.

364
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,683
<i>On her path to Granny's,</i>

365
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,842
<i>the little girl suddenly found herself</i>

366
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,005
<i>in a very unusual part of the wood.</i>

367
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,087
Good day, young lady.

368
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,769
Good day, Mr. Wolf.

369
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,727
Whither away so hurriedly?

370
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,730
To my grandmother's.

371
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,324
And what might be in your basket?

372
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,090
Some bread.
For Grandmother.

373
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,200
So she'll have something good
to make her strong.

374
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,880
And where might your grandmother live?

375
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,920
A good quarter of a league further
in the woods.

376
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,640
Her house stands
inside a great oak tree.

377
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,606
<i>Look at that flesh
Pink and plump</i>

378
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,725
<i>Hello, little girl</i>

379
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,601
<i>Tender and fresh
Not one lump</i>

380
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,923
<i>Hello, little girl</i>

381
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,649
<i>This one's especially lush</i>

382
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,771
<i>Delicious</i>

383
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,603
<i>Hello, little girl
What's your rush?</i>

384
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,600
<i>You're missing all the flowers</i>

385
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,131
<i>The sun won't set for hours</i>

386
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,566
<i>Take your time</i>

387
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,451
<i>Mother said, "Straight ahead"
Not to delay or be misled</i>

388
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,286
<i>But slow, little girl
Hark and hush</i>

389
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,400
<i>The birds are singing sweetly</i>

390
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,768
<i>You'll miss the birds completely</i>

391
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,800
<i>You're traveling so fleetly</i>

392
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,964
<i>Grandmother first
Then Miss Plump</i>

393
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,522
<i>What a delectable couple</i>

394
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,763
<i>Utter perfection
One brittle, one supple</i>

395
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,920
<i>- One moment, my dear
- Mother said, "Come what may</i>

396
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,644
<i>"Follow the path and never stray"</i>

397
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,849
<i>Just so, little girl
Any path</i>

398
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,809
<i>So many worth exploring</i>

399
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,962
<i>Just one would be so boring</i>

400
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,531
<i>And look what you're ignoring</i>

401
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,122
<i>Think of those crisp, aging bones</i>

402
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,489
<i>Then something fresh on the palate</i>

403
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,007
<i>Think of that scrumptious carnality</i>

404
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,004
<i>Twice in one day</i>

405
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,482
<i>There's no possible way</i>

406
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,723
<i>To describe what you feel</i>

407
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,850
<i>When you're talking to your meal</i>

408
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,964
For Granny.

409
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,650
<i>Mother said not to stray</i>

410
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,565
<i>Still, I suppose, a small delay</i>

411
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,528
<i>Granny might like a fresh bouquet</i>

412
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,086
<i>Goodbye, Mr. Wolf</i>

413
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,083
<i>Goodbye, little girl</i>

414
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,842
<i>And hello</i>

415
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,761
What are you waiting for?
Get the cape!

416
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,285
You frightened me!

417
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,570
Get it, get it, get it, get it!

418
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,245
How am I supposed to get it?

419
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,721
You go up to the little thing,
and you take it!

420
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,405
I can't just take a cloak
from a little girl.

421
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,767
- Why don't you take it?
- It's the rules.

422
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,042
Why do you think I asked you
to do it in the first place?

423
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,568
I'm not allowed to touch
any of the objects.

424
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,969
Get me what I need!

425
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,601
Get me what I need!

426
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,124
Hello there, little girl.

427
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,201
Hello, Mr. Baker.

428
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,886
Have you saved some of those sweets
for Granny?

429
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,162
I ate all the sweets
and half a loaf of bread.

430
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,731
So I see.

431
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,765
Now, tell me, where did you
get that beautiful cape?

432
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,406
- My granny made it for me.
- Is that so?

433
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,968
I would love a
red cape like that.

434
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,009
You would look pretty foolish.

435
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,080
I would, wouldn't I?

436
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,240
May I take a look at it?

437
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,089
- No!
- No, I need it badly.

438
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,686
It's mine!
Give it back!

439
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,809
Give it back!

440
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,364
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I just wanted to make sure

441
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,522
that you really loved that cape.

442
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,926
Now off you go to Granny's,

443
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,168
and be careful that
no wolf comes your way.

444
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,642
I'd rather a wolf than you any day!

445
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,807
This is hopeless!

446
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,845
I'm never gonna find that red cape,

447
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,447
or a yellow slipper and a golden cow.

448
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,847
Oh, wait, is it a golden slipper
and a yellow cow?

449
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,126
<i>The cow as white as milk</i>

450
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,645
<i>The cape as red as blood</i>

451
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,847
<i>The hair as yellow as corn</i>

452
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,921
<i>The slipper as pure as...</i>

453
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,843
- What are you doing here?
- You forgot your scarf.

454
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,849
You shouldn't be here.
It's not safe in these woods.

455
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,365
- I want to help.
- No!

456
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,000
<i>- The spell is on my house
- Our house</i>

457
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,360
<i>Only I can lift the spell</i>

458
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,851
<i>- We must lift the spell together
- The spell is on my house</i>

459
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,525
<i>The spell is on...</i>

460
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,884
A cow as white as...

461
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,045
Milk.

462
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,361
Go.

463
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,887
- Hello there, young lad.
- Hello, sir.

464
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,249
What might you be doing
with a cow in the middle of the forest?

465
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,402
I was heading towards market,

466
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,683
but I seem to have lost my way.

467
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,000
"What are you planning on doing there?"

468
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,082
What are you planning on doing there?

469
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,571
Sell my cow, sir.

470
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,210
No less than five pounds.

471
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,771
Five pounds?

472
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,480
Where are we supposed
to get five pounds?

473
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,328
She must be very generous of milk
to fetch five pounds.

474
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,240
Yes, ma'am.

475
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,882
Um, and if you can't fetch that sum,
then what are you to do?

476
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,285
I hadn't thought of that.

477
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,563
This is all we have.

478
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,767
Beans?

479
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,605
Oh, no, we mustn't give up our beans!

480
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,205
Well, if you feel that we must.

481
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,930
Beans in exchange for my cow?

482
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,287
Oh, no, son.
These are no ordinary beans.

483
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,250
These beans, they carry magic.

484
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,448
Magic?
What kind of magic?

485
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,886
Tell him.

486
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,081
It's, uh...

487
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,767
- It's a magic that defies description.
- Yes.

488
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,206
- How many beans?
- Six.

489
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,281
- Five.
- Five.

490
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,880
They're worth a pound each, at least.

491
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,930
Could I buy my cow back someday?

492
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,247
- Well... Possibly.
- Yes.

493
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,090
So, yeah,

494
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,169
it seems like we've made a fair trade.

495
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,240
Okay.

496
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:21,602
Here you go.
There's one, two,

497
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,488
three, four, five.

498
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,449
All right, well, good luck,

499
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,126
and pleasure doing business with you.

500
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,445
One day, I'll buy you back.

501
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,931
Promise.

502
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,928
Take the cow and go home.

503
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,080
I was just trying to help.

504
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,810
Magic beans?

505
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,610
We've no reason to believe
they're magic.

506
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,808
Are we to dispel this curse
through deceit?

507
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,962
No one would have given him
more for this creature.

508
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,487
We did him a favor.
At least they'll have some food now.

509
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,687
Five beans?

510
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,683
- Do you want a child or not?
- Of course I do.

511
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,490
We have one chance.

512
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,007
Don't you see that?
And if we fail...

513
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,288
I'm not sure I'm cut
out to be a father.

514
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,165
Why would you say that?

515
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,481
Because of my father.

516
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,721
You're not him!

517
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,001
I don't know.

518
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,850
If you can't do this for yourself,

519
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,128
can't you at least do it for me?

520
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,845
Okay. Fine.
But will you take the cow and go home?

521
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,684
I will find the rest of the things

522
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,490
on my own.

523
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,161
Stay.

524
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,561
Rapunzel!

525
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,562
Rapunzel!

526
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,084
Let down your hair to me!

527
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,842
Rapunzel?

528
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,250
<i>The old enchantress
had given the name Rapunzel</i>

529
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,404
<i>to the child she had hidden away
and locked in a doorless tower.</i>

530
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,725
<i>But little did She know</i>

531
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,571
<i>that the girl's lilting voice
had caught the attention</i>

532
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,370
<i>of a handsome prince.</i>

533
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,085
Rapunzel.

534
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,727
Don't you look lovely today, my dear.

535
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,490
Thank you, Mother.

536
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,963
I brought your favorite.

537
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,167
Blackberries.

538
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,241
Fresh from the garden.

539
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,644
<i>As the little girl
approached her granny's oak tree,</i>

540
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,361
<i>she was surprised to see
the door standing open.</i>

541
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,161
Oh, dear.

542
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,803
How uneasy I feel.

543
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,602
Perhaps it's all the sweets.

544
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,330
Granny?

545
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,642
Come in, my dearie.

546
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,889
My, Grandmother.

547
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,210
You're looking very strange.

548
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,208
What big ears you have.

549
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,201
The better to hear you with,

550
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,485
my dear.

551
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,246
<i>And with a single bound</i>

552
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,368
<i>the big, bad Wolf had
devoured the little girl.</i>

553
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,324
<i>Well, it was a full day of eating for both.</i>

554
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,240
Help! Get us out!

555
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,602
I can't believe I just did that.

556
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,721
Wait!

557
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,282
Aren't you gonna help us
skin that beast?

558
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,726
No, no.
No thanks.

559
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,207
What kind of hunter are you?

560
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,964
I'm a baker.

561
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,565
Wait a minute, I never thanked you!

562
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,330
You need to be more careful,
young lady.

563
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,401
I'm sorry.

564
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,289
I should have known better.

565
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,324
<i>Mother said,
"Straight ahead"</i>

566
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,607
<i>Not to delay or be misled</i>

567
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,248
<i>I should have heeded her advice</i>

568
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,728
<i>But he seemed so nice</i>

569
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,567
<i>And he showed me things
Many beautiful things</i>

570
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,247
<i>That I hadn't thought to explore</i>

571
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,609
<i>They were off my path
So I never had dared</i>

572
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,763
<i>I had been so careful</i>

573
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,729
<i>I never had cared</i>

574
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:01,726
<i>And he made me feel excited
Well, excited and scared</i>

575
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:07,841
<i>When he said, "Come in"
With that sickening grin</i>

576
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,606
<i>How could I know what was in store?</i>

577
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:14,961
<i>Once his teeth were bared,
though I really got scared</i>

578
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,010
<i>Well, excited and scared</i>

579
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,762
<i>But he drew me close</i>

580
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,126
<i>And he swallowed me down</i>

581
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,964
<i>Down a dark, slimy path</i>

582
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,521
<i>Where lie secrets
That I never want to know</i>

583
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,761
Whoa!

584
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,369
<i>And when everything familiar</i>

585
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,329
<i>Seemed to disappear forever</i>

586
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,768
<i>At the end of the path
Was Granny once again</i>

587
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:45,205
<i>So we lay in the dark
Till you came and set us free</i>

588
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,805
<i>And you brought us to the light</i>

589
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,688
<i>And we're back at the start</i>

590
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:58,322
<i>And I know things now
Many valuable things</i>

591
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:02,002
<i>That I hadn't known before</i>

592
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,162
<i>Do not put your faith</i>

593
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,731
<i>In a cape and a hood</i>

594
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,362
<i>They will not protect you
The way that they should</i>

595
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,170
<i>And take extra care with strangers</i>

596
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,488
<i>Even flowers have their dangers</i>

597
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,165
<i>And though scary is exciting</i>

598
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:18,164
<i>Nice is different than good</i>

599
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,202
Mr. Baker, you saved our lives.

600
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,047
Here.

601
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,525
- Are you certain?
- Yes.

602
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,524
Maybe Granny will make me another one
out of the skins of that wolf.

603
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,091
Thank you.

604
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,851
Thank you!

605
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,721
Ugh!

606
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,609
<i>Now I know: don't be scared</i>

607
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,366
<i>Granny is right, just be prepared</i>

608
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,762
<i>Isn't it nice to know a lot</i>

609
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,722
<i>And a little bit</i>

610
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,921
<i>Not</i>

611
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,044
How could you do this?

612
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,891
What sort of boy exchanges
a cow for beans?

613
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,690
But they're magic.
The man said.

614
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,887
Oh, get your head
out of the clouds, Jack!

615
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,371
Ow!

616
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,487
Mother, no!

617
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,085
Go on, get in there!

618
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,608
You and your worthless adventures,
Jack! Will you never learn?

619
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,411
To bed without supper for you!

620
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,441
Beans!

621
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,088
<i>The first night
of the Festival Ball</i>

622
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,169
<i>brought Cinderella her wish.</i>

623
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,721
<i>The Prince danced only with her,</i>

624
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,441
<i>till he turned,
and she had slipped</i> away.

625
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,806
That way!

626
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,446
Quickly!

627
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,445
I must find that girl.

628
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,921
Oh!

629
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,641
Oh!

630
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,488
- Are you all right, miss?
- Yes.

631
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,966
I just need to catch my breath.

632
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,610
Oh, what a beautiful gown!

633
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,170
Were you at the King's Festival?

634
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,401
- Yes.
- Ooh!

635
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,650
Aren't you the lucky one.

636
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,689
Why ever are you in the woods
at this hour?

637
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,887
This way!

638
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,480
Please don't let them know that I'm here.

639
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,845
Oh, my God.

640
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,243
Have you seen a beautiful young woman
in a ball gown pass through?

641
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,324
I don't think so, sir.

642
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,369
If I may, My Lord,
I think I see her over there!

643
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,726
Onward!

644
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,160
I've never lied to royalty before.

645
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,363
I've never anything to royalty before!

646
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,885
Thank you.

647
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,408
If a prince were looking for me,
I certainly wouldn't hide.

648
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,081
Uh...

649
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,921
Well...

650
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,889
What brings you here,

651
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,405
and with a cow?

652
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,649
On, um...

653
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,360
Well, my husband's
somewhere in the woods.

654
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,046
He's undoing a spell.

655
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,361
Oh.

656
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,887
Yes.

657
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,648
But tell me, the Prince,
what was he like?

658
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,764
<i>He's</i> a <i>very nice prince</i>

659
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,840
<i>And?</i>

660
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,046
And...

661
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,929
<i>It's a very nice ball</i>

662
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,041
<i>And?</i>

663
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,121
And...

664
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,611
<i>When I entered, they trumpeted</i>

665
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,404
<i>And? The Prince?</i>

666
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,641
<i>- Oh, the Prince
- Yes, the Prince</i>

667
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,881
<i>Well, he's tall</i>

668
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,201
<i>Is that all?</i>

669
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,971
<i>Did you dance?
Is he charming?</i>

670
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,883
<i>They say that he's charming</i>

671
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,088
<i>We did nothing but dance</i>

672
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,730
<i>Yes?</i>

673
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,291
<i>- And?
- And it made a nice change</i>

674
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,400
<i>No, the Prince</i>

675
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,090
<i>- Oh, the Prince
- Yes, the Prince</i>

676
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,726
<i>He has charm for a prince, I guess</i>

677
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,325
<i>You guess?</i>

678
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,290
<i>I don't meet a wide range</i>

679
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,569
<i>And it's all very strange</i>

680
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,722
But why would you run away?

681
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,483
It's not quite what I expected.

682
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,564
What?
Princes and castles and gowns?

683
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,848
I have no experience with those things.

684
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,082
But you will return to
the Festival tomorrow eve?

685
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,401
Yes.

686
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,686
No.

687
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,281
I don't know.

688
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,160
You don't know?

689
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,806
Oh,
what I wouldn't give to be in your shoes.

690
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,928
Well, your slippers.

691
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,806
As pure as gold?

692
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,960
I must get home.

693
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,161
No, wait.
I need your shoes!

694
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,481
Milky-White!

695
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,848
One midnight gone!

696
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,081
Already?

697
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,486
Get the cow!

698
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,685
Mr. Baker!
Mr. Baker!

699
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,281
Good fortune!
Good fortune, sir!

700
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,966
Look what I have!
Five gold pieces!

701
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,203
How would you come by
five gold pieces?

702
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,730
<i>There are giants in the sky</i>

703
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:10,409
<i>There are big, tall,
terrible giants in the sky</i>

704
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,404
<i>When you're way up high
And you look below</i>

705
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,480
<i>At the world you've left
And the things you know</i>

706
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,562
<i>Little more than a glance
ls enough to show you</i>

707
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,563
<i>Just how small you are</i>

708
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,248
<i>When you're way up high
And you're on your own</i>

709
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,890
<i>In a world like none
That you've ever known</i>

710
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,804
<i>Where the sky is lead
And the earth is stone</i>

711
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,567
<i>You're free to do
Whatever pleases you</i>

712
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,563
<i>Exploring things you'd never dare</i>

713
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,722
<i>'Cause you don't care
When suddenly there's</i>

714
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:42,249
<i>A big, tall, terrible giant at the door</i>

715
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,721
A giant?

716
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,171
<i>A big, tall, terrible lady giant</i>

717
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,085
<i>Sweeping the floor</i>

718
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,247
<i>And she gives you food
And she gives you rest</i>

719
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,007
<i>And she draws you close
To her giant breast</i>

720
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,810
<i>And you know things now</i>

721
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:06,124
<i>That you never knew before</i>

722
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,922
<i>Not till the sky</i>

723
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,124
<i>Only just when you've made
A friend and all</i>

724
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,120
<i>And you know she's big
But you don't feel small</i>

725
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,880
<i>Someone bigger than her
Comes along the hall</i>

726
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,122
<i>To swallow you for lunch</i>

727
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,520
<i>And your heart is lead
And your stomach stone</i>

728
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,962
<i>And you're really scared
Being all alone</i>

729
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,963
<i>And it's then that you miss
All the things you've known</i>

730
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,804
<i>And the world you've left
And the little you own</i>

731
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:33,328
<i>The fun is done
You steal what you can and run</i>

732
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,323
<i>And you scramble down
And you look below</i>

733
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,448
<i>And the world you know
Begins to grow</i>

734
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:43,807
<i>The roof, the house
And your mother at the door</i>

735
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,561
<i>The roof</i>

736
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,690
<i>The house
And the world you never</i>

737
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,730
<i>Thought to explore</i>

738
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:55,487
<i>And you think of
All of the things you've seen</i>

739
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:59,361
<i>And you wish that
You could live in between</i>

740
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,847
<i>And you're back again</i>

741
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:05,728
<i>Only different than before</i>

742
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,931
<i>After the sky</i>

743
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:12,846
<i>There are giants in the sky</i>

744
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,924
<i>There are big, tall, terrible
Awesome, scary</i>

745
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,526
<i>Wonderful giants</i>

746
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,923
<i>In the sky</i>

747
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,411
There's your money, sir.
Five gold pieces.

748
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,770
Where's my Milky-White?

749
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,001
Uh...

750
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,684
Milky-White is at home with my Wife.

751
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,365
- Let's go find them.
- No, wait.

752
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,851
I'm not sure I want to sell.

753
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,206
But you said I could buy her back.

754
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,880
- Do you want more money?
- Well... No.

755
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,565
You keep that, I'll fetch some more.

756
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,766
I'll just go back up the beanstalk.

757
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,246
Wait!

758
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,811
Wait! Wait!

759
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,765
Hey! Wait!

760
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,042
Wait! Wait!

761
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,202
I said wait!

762
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,530
What are you doing here?

763
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,525
Well...

764
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,361
Oh, I see you got the cape!

765
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,971
Yes, I've got the cape.
Only two items left.

766
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,087
Three.

767
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,241
Two.
We've the cape and the cow.

768
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,203
You've got the cape!

769
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,563
What have you done with the cow?

770
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,044
- She ran away.
- What?

771
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,680
I never even reached home.
I've been looking for her all night.

772
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,721
How could you?

773
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,324
Well, she might just as easily
have run away from you.

774
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,721
- Yeah, but she didn't.
- Yeah, but she might have done.

775
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,881
- But she didn't.
- But she might have done!

776
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,001
But she didn't!

777
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,806
Who cares?

778
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,651
Cow's gone!
Get it back! Get it back!

779
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,607
We were just about to do that,

780
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,603
but here, in the meantime,
we've got this.

781
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,411
Get away from me with that, you fool!

782
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,161
I can't touch it, remember?

783
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,924
Right.
No, I forgot.

784
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,926
By midnight tomorrow
bring me the items,

785
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,402
or that child you wish for
will never see the light of day!

786
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,002
I don't like that woman.

787
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,444
I'm sorry I lost the cow.

788
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,011
I shouldn't have yelled.

789
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,045
Will you go back to the village?

790
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,770
I will make things right.

791
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,490
And we can carry on with our lives.

792
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,211
No more witches or dim-witted boys

793
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,646
or hungry little girls.

794
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,126
Will you go?

795
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,441
Please.

796
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,281
Go.

797
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,643
Ah! Good brother!

798
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,801
I was wondering where you had gone.

799
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,644
I've been searching all night for her.

800
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,721
Her?

801
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,485
The beautiful one
I danced the evening with.

802
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,846
Where did she go?

803
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,485
Disappeared,

804
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,722
like the fine morning mist.

805
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:50,921
She was lovely?

806
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,321
Oh!
The loveliest.

807
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,244
I'm not certain of that.

808
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,321
I must confess, I, too,
have found a lovely maiden.

809
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,321
She lives here, in the woods.

810
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,846
- In the woods?
- Yes!

811
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,685
On top of a tall tower
that has no doors or stairs.

812
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,761
Where?

813
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,684
Two leagues from here, due east,

814
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,524
just beyond the mossy knoll
near the rose thickets.

815
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,170
And how do you manage a visit?

816
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,091
I stand beneath her tower

817
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:16,722
and I say, "Rapunzel!
Rapunzel, let down your hair to me."

818
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,848
And she lowers the longest,

819
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,206
most beautiful head of hair,

820
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,407
yellow as corn,

821
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,206
which I climb.

822
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,600
Rapunzel?

823
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,200
- Rapunzel?
- Yeah.

824
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,208
What kind of name is that? You jest!

825
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,442
Never heard of such a thing.

826
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,045
I speak the truth!

827
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,611
She's as true as your maiden.

828
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,603
A maiden running from a prince?

829
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,122
None would run from us.

830
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,440
Yet one has.

831
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:53,487
<i>Did I abuse her?
Or show her disdain?</i>

832
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:56,769
<i>Why does she run from me?</i>

833
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:00,723
<i>If I should lose her
How shall I regain</i>

834
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,884
<i>The heart she has won from me?</i>

835
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,882
<i>Agony</i>

836
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:10,323
<i>Beyond power of speech</i>

837
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,280
<i>When the one thing you want</i>

838
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:18,444
<i>Is the only thing out of your reach</i>

839
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,284
<i>High</i> in her tower

840
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,930
<i>She sits by the hour</i>

841
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,924
<i>Maintaining her hair</i>

842
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,288
<i>Blithe and becoming
And frequently humming</i>

843
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,249
<i>A lighthearted air</i>

844
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,082
<i>Agony</i>

845
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,129
<i>Far more painful than yours</i>

846
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,009
<i>When you know she would go with you</i>

847
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:47,763
<i>If there only were doors</i>

848
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,287
Agony

849
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:54,047
<i>Oh, the torture they teach</i>

850
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,810
<i>What's as intriguing</i>

851
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,604
<i>Or half so fatiguing</i>

852
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,371
<i>As what's out of reach?</i>

853
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,808
<i>Am I</i> not <i>sensitive</i>

854
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,167
<i>Clever, well-mannered, considerate</i>

855
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:09,290
<i>Passionate, charming
As kind as I'm handsome</i>

856
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,522
<i>And heir to a throne?</i>

857
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,967
<i>You are everything
maidens could wish for</i>

858
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,690
<i>- Then why no?
- Do I know?</i>

859
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,002
<i>The girl must be mad</i>

860
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:22,403
<i>You know nothing of madness</i>

861
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:26,963
<i>Till you're climbing her hair
And you see her up there</i>

862
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:30,721
<i>As you're nearing her
All the while hearing her</i>

863
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:38,241
Agony

864
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,321
<i>- Misery
- Woe</i>

865
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:42,847
<i>Though it's different for each</i>

866
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,843
<i>Always ten steps behind</i>

867
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,570
<i>Always ten feet below</i>

868
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:50,003
<i>And she's just out of reach</i>

869
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,083
<i>Agony</i>

870
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:55,722
<i>That can cut like a knife</i>

871
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,886
<i>I must have her</i>

872
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,406
<i>To wife</i>

873
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,891
Rapunzel, Rapunzel.

874
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,486
Let down your hair to me.

875
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,927
Is that you at this hour, my Prince?

876
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:03,441
Yes.

877
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:33,965
Excuse me for this.

878
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,564
Oh!

879
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,681
<i>As the Baker's wife
bolted from the tower,</i>

880
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,440
<i>the second night
of the Festival was thrown into chaos...</i>

881
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:52,600
Stop!

882
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,325
<i>...when Cinderella,
once again, ran from the Prince.</i>

883
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:11,721
What are you doing?

884
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:14,326
So sorry, I need your shoe.

885
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:20,040
I see her over there!

886
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:27,324
Who is she?
Where did she go?

887
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:28,641
I have no idea, sir.

888
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,484
Don't play the fool, woman.

889
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,529
No, I was trying to hold her here for you.

890
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:33,926
I can capture my own damsel, thank you.

891
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,001
Yes, of course.

892
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:36,486
There's no sign of her, my liege.

893
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:37,841
Well, what are you waiting for?

894
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,763
See if you can find her.
Go!

895
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:45,445
The woods can be a dangerous place.

896
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:47,721
On!

897
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:56,284
Moo!

898
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:06,889
I hope that skinny girl
isn't there tomorrow night.

899
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,084
I mean, who was that girl?

900
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,050
Please, if you would be so kind,

901
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,202
may I compare this ear of corn
to your hair?

902
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:14,725
You savage!

903
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:18,320
Mongrel!

904
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:20,124
He is revolting!

905
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:35,761
Milky-White!

906
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,605
- I thought you were returning home!
- It's you!

907
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:49,761
You've got the cow!

908
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,331
Yes, I've got the cow.
We've two of the four.

909
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:52,811
- No, three.
- Two.

910
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:55,606
Three! Compare this to your corn.

911
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:58,681
Where did you find it?

912
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,484
Just pulled it from a maiden in a tower.

913
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:01,681
- Three!
- Three.

914
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,640
And I almost had the fourth,
but she got away.

915
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:04,841
We've one entire day left.

916
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,764
Surely we can locate the slipper by then.

917
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:07,921
We?

918
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:10,890
Do you mean you're
going to let me stay with you?

919
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:17,766
Perhaps it will take two of us
to have this child.

920
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:22,442
<i>You've changed
You're daring</i>

921
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,807
<i>You're different in the woods</i>

922
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,969
<i>More sure
More sharing</i>

923
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:31,600
<i>You're getting us through the woods</i>

924
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:35,284
<i>If you could see</i>

925
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:38,489
<i>You're not the man who started</i>

926
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,964
<i>And much more open-hearted</i>

927
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:45,283
<i>Than I knew you to be</i>

928
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:46,721
<i>It takes two</i>

929
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,804
<i>I thought one was enough
It's not true</i>

930
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:52,964
<i>It takes two of us
You came through</i>

931
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:56,010
<i>When the journey was rough
It took you</i>

932
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,164
<i>It took two of us
It takes care</i>

933
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:03,882
<i>It takes patience and fear and despair
To change</i>

934
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:06,321
<i>Though you swear
To change</i>

935
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,164
<i>Who can tell if you do?</i>

936
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,001
<i>It takes two</i>

937
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:12,090
<i>You've changed</i>

938
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:16,484
<i>You're thriving
There's something about the woods</i>

939
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,769
<i>Not just surviving</i>

940
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:23,003
<i>You're blossoming in the woods</i>

941
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:26,004
<i>At home I'd fear</i>

942
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:29,209
<i>We'd stay the same forever</i>

943
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:32,409
<i>And then, out here</i>

944
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:35,609
<i>You're passionate, charming
Considerate, clever</i>

945
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:36,761
<i>It takes one</i>

946
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,851
<i>To begin
But then once you've begun</i>

947
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,727
<i>It takes two of you
It's no fun</i>

948
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,449
<i>But what needs to be done
You can do</i>

949
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,090
<i>When there's two of you</i>

950
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,890
<i>If I dare</i>

951
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:54,047
<i>It's because I'm becoming
Aware of us</i>

952
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:56,408
<i>As a pair of us</i>

953
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:59,200
<i>Each accepting a share</i>

954
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:00,726
<i>Of what's there</i>

955
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,120
<i>We've changed</i>

956
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:06,444
<i>We're strangers
I'm meeting you in the woods</i>

957
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:10,209
<i>Who minds what dangers?</i>

958
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,727
<i>I know we'll get past the woods</i>

959
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:16,211
<i>And once we're past</i>

960
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,404
<i>Let's hope the changes last</i>

961
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:20,925
<i>Beyond woods</i>

962
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:23,924
<i>Beyond witches and slippers and hoods</i>

963
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:27,084
<i>Just the two of us
Beyond lies</i>

964
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:30,130
<i>Safe at home with our beautiful prize</i>

965
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:33,124
<i>Just the few of us
It takes trust</i>

966
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,568
<i>It takes just a bit more
And we're done</i>

967
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:37,926
<i>We want four, we had none</i>

968
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:40,970
<i>We've got three
We need one</i>

969
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,121
<i>It takes two</i>

970
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,331
Stop it! Stop my egg!

971
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,523
Oh, brilliant! My Milky-White!

972
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:54,761
I've missed you so much!

973
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,120
Where did you get this?

974
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,287
From the giant's hen.

975
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:00,086
A golden egg!
I've never seen a golden egg before.

976
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:02,169
And you can have it,
along with the five gold pieces.

977
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:03,441
What five gold pieces?

978
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:04,601
Now I'm taking my cow.

979
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,171
No! I do not wish to sell.

980
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:07,367
But you took the five gold pieces.

981
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,124
- I didn't take, you gave.
- But you said I could have my cow!

982
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,201
Where are the five gold pieces?

983
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,123
I never said you could.
I said you might.

984
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:13,801
You would take money before a child?

985
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,040
No, no, no, it's not like that.
It wasn't like that.

986
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:17,561
It's not like I've
done a deal with him.

987
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:18,886
- How could you do that?
- It all just happened so fast.

988
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:19,961
Milky-White!

989
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,001
Milky-White is dead.

990
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:28,685
What?

991
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,441
<i>Two midnights gone!</i>

992
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:45,121
As dawn <i>broke</i>

993
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:47,891
<i>the Baker and his wife
had but one day left</i>

994
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:49,963
<i>to reverse the Witch's curse.</i>

995
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:51,970
<i>As for Rapunzel's Prince,</i>

996
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,481
<i>he returned yet again
to the forbidden tower.</i>

997
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,448
No!
Bad idea!

998
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:06,851
Are you all right?

999
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,844
Yep, yeah.
Feel fine. Fine.

1000
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,729
<i>What did I clearly say?
Children must listen</i>

1001
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,564
No! Please!

1002
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:51,041
<i>What were you not to do?
Children must see</i>

1003
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,121
No!

1004
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:55,126
<i>And learn</i>

1005
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:56,964
<i>Why could you not obey?</i>

1006
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:59,209
<i>Children should listen</i>

1007
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,722
<i>What have I been to you?</i>

1008
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:03,723
<i>What would you have me be?</i>

1009
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:07,805
<i>Handsome like a prince?</i>

1010
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:13,247
<i>But I am old
I am ugly</i>

1011
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,289
<i>- I embarrass you
- No!</i>

1012
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,680
<i>You are ashamed of me</i>

1013
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:17,807
No!

1014
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:19,962
<i>You are ashamed</i>

1015
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:25,962
<i>You don't understand</i>

1016
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:36,847
I'm no longer a child.
I wish to see the world.

1017
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:46,166
<i>Don't you know what's out there
in the world?</i>

1018
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:53,446
<i>Someone has to shield you
from the world</i>

1019
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:57,604
<i>Stay with me</i>

1020
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:07,686
<i>Princes wait there in the world, it's true</i>

1021
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:14,486
<i>Princes, yes,
but wolves and humans, too</i>

1022
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,726
<i>Stay at home</i>

1023
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:21,564
<i>I am home</i>

1024
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:25,361
<i>Who out there</i>

1025
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:29,491
<i>Could love you more than I?</i>

1026
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:32,120
<i>What out there</i>

1027
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:36,689
<i>That I cannot supply?</i>

1028
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:39,571
<i>Stay with me</i>

1029
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:46,011
<i>Stay with me</i>

1030
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:51,166
<i>The world is dark and wild</i>

1031
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,731
<i>Stay a child</i>

1032
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:02,886
<i>While you can be a child</i>

1033
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,849
<i>With me</i>

1034
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,522
I gave you protection

1035
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,288
and yet you disobeyed me.

1036
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:25,521
No.

1037
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:30,042
Your prince will never
lay eyes on you again.

1038
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:32,522
He will never lay eyes
on anything again.

1039
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:34,045
What did you do to him?

1040
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,564
It doesn't matter,

1041
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,808
because where you're going

1042
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:41,600
no one will ever see you again!

1043
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,808
No! No!

1044
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,410
No!

1045
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:01,881
Hey, there.
Nice cape.

1046
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:04,811
Stay away from my cape,
or I'll slash you into a thousand bits!

1047
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,331
Whoa!
I don't want it.

1048
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,440
- Where did you get it?
- My granny made it for me

1049
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,244
from a wolf that attacked us.

1050
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,528
And she gave me this beautiful knife
for protection.

1051
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:14,728
Oh, look what I have.
A golden egg.

1052
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,006
Where did you get that egg?

1053
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:21,403
I stole a hen that lays golden eggs
from the kingdom of the giant.

1054
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,206
I don't believe you.

1055
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:25,931
It's true.
And you should see the giant's toy harp.

1056
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:28,447
It plays the most beautiful tunes
without you even having to touch it.

1057
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:29,726
Of course it does.

1058
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:31,640
Why don't you go up
to the kingdom right now,

1059
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,364
bring it back and show it to me?

1060
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,045
- I could.
- You could not.

1061
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:36,241
I could!

1062
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:37,441
You could not, Mr. Liar!

1063
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,682
I'm not a liar.
I'll get that harp, you'll see!

1064
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,603
<i>Jack took
the little girl's dare,</i>

1065
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,091
<i>and before he knew it</i>

1066
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:46,640
<i>found himself fleeing from a giant.</i>

1067
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:52,568
Bring back my harp!

1068
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,203
I'll grind your bones!

1069
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:11,801
Okay, we don't have much time left.

1070
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,041
I don't know where to start.

1071
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,645
You can start by buying a new cow

1072
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:15,767
with the money you took from the boy.

1073
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,490
Right, okay, and where do I buy a cow?

1074
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:19,881
Just go to the next village.
I'm sure you'll find a cow there.

1075
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:21,041
Okay, and what are you going to do?

1076
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:22,161
I'm going to get the slipper.

1077
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:24,129
- The yellow slipper?
- The golden slipper!

1078
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:25,600
The golden slipper, that's right.

1079
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:27,320
Where are you going to find it?

1080
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:28,721
I've met a maiden,
these two previous nights,

1081
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:29,801
with golden slippers.

1082
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,920
- Do you think you can get one?
- I'm sure of it.

1083
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,287
Wait.

1084
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,169
Why are we always separating?

1085
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,440
Because we have to,
if we're going to be together.

1086
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:54,806
What?

1087
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:58,330
<i>The entire kingdom shook</i>

1088
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,687
<i>when the beanstalk
came crashing down,</i>

1089
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:02,649
<i>killing the giant.</i>

1090
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:06,841
<i>As for the indecisive Cinderella,</i>

1091
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,849
<i>she fled from the Prince.</i>

1092
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,530
<i>Again.</i>

1093
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:11,920
After her!

1094
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:43,727
<i>He's</i> a <i>very smart prince</i>

1095
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:47,402
<i>He's a prince who prepares</i>

1096
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:51,731
<i>Knowing this time
I'd run from him</i>

1097
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,571
<i>He spread pitch on the stairs</i>

1098
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:58,087
<i>And I'm caught unawares</i>

1099
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:01,244
<i>Well, it means that he cares</i>

1100
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,766
<i>This is more than just malice</i>

1101
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:08,326
<i>Better stop and take stock</i>

1102
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:09,561
<i>While you're standing here stuck</i>

1103
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:12,086
<i>On the steps of the palace</i>

1104
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:15,087
<i>All right, what do you want?</i>

1105
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,761
<i>Have to make a decision</i>

1106
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:19,206
<i>Why not stay and be caught?</i>

1107
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:20,560
<i>Should I give that a thought?</i>

1108
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:22,921
<i>What would be his response?</i>

1109
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,091
<i>But then what if he knew who I am</i>

1110
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:28,762
<i>When I know that I'm not
What he thinks that he wants?</i>

1111
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,761
<i>Or then, what if I am</i>

1112
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,241
<i>What a prince would envision?</i>

1113
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,721
<i>But then how can you know
Who you are till you know</i>

1114
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:38,126
<i>What you want, which I don't?</i>

1115
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:39,406
<i>So then, which do you pick?</i>

1116
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:41,289
<i>Where you're safe out of sight
and yourself</i>

1117
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,807
<i>But where everything's wrong?</i>

1118
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:45,801
<i>Or where everything's right</i>

1119
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:48,929
<i>But you know that you'll never belong?</i>

1120
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:51,249
<i>And whichever you pick
Do it quick</i>

1121
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:52,561
<i>'Cause you're starting to stick</i>

1122
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:55,041
<i>To the steps of the palace</i>

1123
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,127
<i>It's my first big decision</i>

1124
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:00,760
<i>The choice isn't easy to make</i>

1125
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:03,127
<i>To arrive at a ball
ls exciting and all</i>

1126
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:05,721
<i>Once you're there, though, it's scary</i>

1127
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:08,167
<i>And it's fun to deceive
When you know you can leave</i>

1128
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:10,721
<i>But you have to be wary</i>

1129
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,086
<i>There's a lot that's at stake</i>

1130
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:13,286
<i>But I've stalled long enough</i>

1131
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:14,601
<i>'Cause I'm still standing stuck</i>

1132
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:16,091
<i>In the stuff on these steps</i>

1133
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,641
<i>Better run along home</i>

1134
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:21,087
<i>And avoid the collision</i>

1135
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:22,401
<i>Though at home, they don't care</i>

1136
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:23,641
<i>I'll be better off there</i>

1137
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:25,205
<i>Where there's nothing to choose</i>

1138
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:27,442
<i>So there's nothing to lose</i>

1139
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:32,288
<i>So I'll pry up my shoes</i>

1140
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:34,681
<i>Wait, though, thinking it through</i>

1141
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:37,002
<i>Things don't have to collide</i>

1142
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:40,846
<i>I know what my decision is
Which is not to decide</i>

1143
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:43,761
<i>I'll just leave him a clue</i>

1144
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,490
<i>For example</i>

1145
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,369
<i>A shoe</i>

1146
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:50,807
<i>And then see what he'll do</i>

1147
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:53,201
<i>Now it's he and not you
Who'll be stuck with a shoe</i>

1148
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,770
<i>In a stew</i>

1149
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:56,967
<i>In the goo</i>

1150
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,130
<i>And I've learned something, too</i>

1151
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:02,328
<i>Something I never knew</i>

1152
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:10,166
<i>On the steps of the palace</i>

1153
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:16,009
With me! Quick, men!

1154
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:18,565
She mustn't get away!

1155
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,651
The Ball is over.
Send everyone home.

1156
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:30,530
And the Princess?

1157
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:33,246
She won't get far with one shoe.

1158
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:52,047
- Don't come any closer to me!
- Please, just stop.

1159
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:53,361
Just hear me out.

1160
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,880
- You have attacked me once before.
- I didn't attack you...

1161
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,889
I attacked your shoe.
I need it.

1162
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:01,328
Look. I have a magic bean
in exchange for it.

1163
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:03,567
Magic bean?

1164
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:04,927
Yes.

1165
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:06,880
Nonsense!

1166
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:07,921
No!

1167
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:10,204
Wait, please!
I haven't much time!

1168
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:13,683
I need that shoe, to have a child.

1169
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:15,771
That makes no sense!

1170
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,445
Does it make sense
that you're running from a prince?

1171
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:19,523
- Stop! You there, stop!
- I must go!

1172
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,409
Here, take my shoes.
You'll run faster.

1173
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:23,240
Here.

1174
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:24,725
- Thank you!
- Stop!

1175
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:26,251
Thank you, thank you.

1176
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:27,811
What is that you have in your hand?

1177
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:29,450
Nothing.
It's mine.

1178
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:31,409
Lying will cost you your life.

1179
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:34,649
I don't care if it costs me my life,
just get off!

1180
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:36,480
You will pay for this!

1181
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:39,201
No!

1182
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:41,931
Sire, I have succeeded
in obtaining the other slipper.

1183
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:43,840
Please, kind Prince,
let me have the slipper,

1184
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:45,610
and all will come to a happy end.

1185
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,046
Step back, peon!

1186
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,567
Do as she says, Steward!
We only need one.

1187
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:50,961
- Oh!
- Oh.

1188
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:53,881
Thank you.

1189
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:57,408
We must search immediately
for the maiden who fits this slipper.

1190
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:58,607
Tonight?

1191
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:00,649
This very night! On!

1192
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:01,801
Forward!

1193
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:11,646
<i>And in her haste,</i>

1194
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:13,604
<i>the Baker's wife took no notice</i>

1195
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:16,929
<i>of</i> a <i>second beanstalk
climbing skyward.</i>

1196
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:20,651
Let it be known that
His Royal Highness, the Crown Prince,

1197
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:23,610
will be visiting every house
in this village tonight.

1198
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,967
All young maidens
are hereby commanded

1199
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:30,011
to remain in their home
until visited by the Royal Guard.

1200
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:33,931
Open the gates.

1201
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:36,367
His Royal Highness approaches.

1202
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:41,207
The Prince wishes to meet
all the young maidens of this house.

1203
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:44,207
All young maidens

1204
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:47,206
prepare to meet the Prince.

1205
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:54,963
<i>As the Prince
anxiously waited,</i>

1206
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:56,531
<i>the Stepmother took matters,</i>

1207
01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:00,044
<i>and Florinda's foot, into her own hands.</i>

1208
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:02,562
<i>- Careful, my toe
- Darling, I know</i>

1209
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:04,722
<i>- What'll we do?
- It'll have to go</i>

1210
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:06,882
<i>But when you're his bride
You can sit or ride</i>

1211
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:09,520
<i>You'll never need to walk</i>

1212
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:18,481
<i>Minus one toe,</i>

1213
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:20,961
<i>Florinda mounted the Prince's horse</i>

1214
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:24,209
<i>unaware of the blood dripping
from the slipper.</i>

1215
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:36,844
<i>Lucinda was next.</i>

1216
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,201
<i>Why won't it fit?</i>

1217
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:41,327
<i>Darling, be still</i>

1218
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,209
<i>Cut off a bit of the heel and it will</i>

1219
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:45,328
<i>And when you're his wife
You'll have such a life</i>

1220
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:47,727
<i>You'll never need to walk</i>

1221
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:56,521
<i>Minus a heel,</i>

1222
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:58,284
<i>Lucinda did her best
to swallow the pain.</i>

1223
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:11,204
It's a perfect fit, Your Highness.

1224
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:18,727
Have you no other daughters?

1225
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,644
Only a little, stunted kitchen wench,

1226
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,450
which her late father left behind.

1227
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,768
But she cannot present herself.

1228
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:26,285
She is too dirty.

1229
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:03,608
I would recognize
these beautiful eyes anywhere.

1230
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:06,006
You.

1231
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:11,006
You are my true bride.

1232
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:19,001
Get down.
Get down.

1233
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:26,280
<i>As punishment
for their cruelty,</i>

1234
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:30,766
<i>Cinderella's birds swooped down
upon the stepsisters</i>

1235
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:32,960
<i>and blinded them.</i>

1236
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:38,044
<i>As for Rapunzel,</i>

1237
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:40,521
<i>the Witch had banished her to a swamp</i>

1238
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:43,724
<i>in the darkest depths of the forest.</i>

1239
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:00,685
Rapunzel?

1240
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:03,530
Rapunzel!

1241
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:07,401
Rapunzel!

1242
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:08,726
My darling?

1243
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:10,321
My darling!

1244
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:12,241
I'm here!

1245
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:14,011
Rapunzel?

1246
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:17,490
Rapunzel!

1247
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,001
Is that you?

1248
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:28,560
I'm blind, I can't see.

1249
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:38,242
How could she do this to you?

1250
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:51,771
Rapunzel?

1251
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:52,921
What?

1252
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:56,250
I can see you.

1253
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:00,565
Your hair!

1254
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:11,891
I like it.

1255
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:18,211
Come on.

1256
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:21,927
We don't have much time.

1257
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,289
- Come on!
- I found you!

1258
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:27,643
- You got the cow!
- And you've got the slipper!

1259
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:29,928
- We've got all four!
- Yes, we've got all four!

1260
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:35,961
I see a cow.

1261
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:38,809
- I see a slipper.
- Yes.

1262
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,162
And the cape as red as blood.

1263
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:43,480
- And the hair as yellow as corn.
- We've got all four!

1264
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:46,121
Wait a minute.

1265
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:48,807
That cow doesn't look
as white as milk to me.

1266
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:51,360
- Of course she is.
- Of course it is. Come on.

1267
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:53,330
She has to be.

1268
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:56,843
This cow has been covered with flour!

1269
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,241
You didn't get a real white cow?

1270
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:02,171
We had a cow as white as milk.
Honestly, we did!

1271
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:03,771
- Then where is she?
- She's dead!

1272
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:05,843
And we thought that you would
prefer a live cow.

1273
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,445
Of course I would prefer a live cow!

1274
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:10,371
So, show me the dead cow,
I'll bring her back to life.

1275
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:12,369
Oh. Let's go!

1276
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:14,329
Yeah, okay!
It's this way, this way!

1277
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:16,601
Jack!

1278
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:18,361
Jack!

1279
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:20,521
Jack! Oh!

1280
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:24,010
There you are!
I've been worried sick about you!

1281
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:26,288
There's a dead giant in our backyard!

1282
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:27,407
There is?

1283
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:28,720
You know there is!

1284
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:30,371
You could have been crushed!

1285
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:31,521
But, Mother, look!

1286
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:34,044
The most beautiful harp!

1287
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:38,724
You've stolen too much!

1288
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:41,080
You could have been killed
climbing down that plant!

1289
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:43,360
Come on, quick!
We buried her under some leaves!

1290
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,004
Here, here, it's here!

1291
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:46,160
What's happening?

1292
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:47,440
She's going to bring
Milky-White back to life.

1293
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:48,520
She can do that?

1294
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:49,846
She's a witch, she can do anything.

1295
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:50,967
Wow.

1296
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,724
Stand back.

1297
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:07,369
Milky-White, you're back!
I can't believe it!

1298
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:08,760
It's almost midnight!

1299
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:10,842
Quiet!

1300
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:12,206
Feed the objects to the cow.

1301
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:13,407
What?

1302
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,480
You heard me!
Feed them to the cow!

1303
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:19,081
- Really?
- Just try it.

1304
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:27,169
Fill that With milk.

1305
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:29,000
I'll do it.
She'll only milk for me.

1306
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:30,366
Good boy.

1307
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:43,124
Squeeze, pal.
You can do it.

1308
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:49,245
It's not working!

1309
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:50,401
What?

1310
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:57,201
Wrong ingredients.

1311
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:02,724
Forget about your child.

1312
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:03,881
No, no, no!

1313
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:05,485
We followed your instructions.

1314
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:07,769
One, the cow is as white as milk.

1315
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:08,841
- Correct?
- Yes.

1316
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:10,809
Two,
the cape was certainly as red as blood.

1317
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:13,327
- Yes.
- Three, there was the slipper.

1318
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:15,562
And four, I compared the hair
to this ear of corn!

1319
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:18,724
I pulled this from a maiden in a tower.

1320
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:19,881
You what?

1321
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:21,726
What were you doing there?

1322
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:23,245
Nothing, I was passing by.

1323
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:26,007
I touched that hair!

1324
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:28,481
I told you I can't have touched
any of the ingredients!

1325
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:30,011
- Oh!
- How are we supposed...

1326
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:31,844
- The corn! The corn!
- What?

1327
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,241
You can use the
silky hair off the corn!

1328
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:38,162
- Yes. Pull it from the ear.
- Yes!

1329
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:40,842
Feed it to the cow.
Quickly!

1330
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:48,686
It's working!

1331
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:50,171
She's milking!

1332
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:53,285
At last!

1333
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:15,884
That was quick!

1334
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:56,930
<i>And it came to pass</i>

1335
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:59,082
<i>all that seemed wrong was now right.</i>

1336
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:03,242
<i>The Witch succeeded
in reversing her mother's curse.</i>

1337
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:06,847
<i>Cinderella finally stopped
running from her Prince.</i>

1338
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:11,241
<i>Jack was reunited
with his beloved cow,</i>

1339
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:15,729
<i>and his mother could now dress
in the best a golden egg could buy.</i>

1340
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:18,565
<i>And the Baker and his wife
were proud parents</i>

1341
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:21,769
<i>of a strapping baby boy.</i>

1342
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:25,889
Thanks for the slipper!

1343
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:53,405
Attention!

1344
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:57,130
Let us cheer the newlyweds
as they embark...

1345
01:15:57,320 --> 01:15:59,402
<i>And so,
with the kingdom filled with joy,</i>

1346
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:00,800
<i>those who deserved to</i>

1347
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:02,530
<i>were destined to live happily ever...</i>

1348
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,001
Jack!

1349
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:19,527
Rapunzel!

1350
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:21,443
- Attention! Attention!
- Rapunzel!

1351
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:23,250
Let there be no panic!

1352
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:24,401
No panic!

1353
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:25,601
Jack!

1354
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:27,081
Jack!

1355
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:30,928
The Royal Prince
wishes to address his loyal subjects.

1356
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:32,491
Attention!

1357
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:37,526
There is no need for worry.

1358
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:39,603
It was just an earthquake

1359
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:42,525
in a far quadrant of our kingdom.

1360
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,207
<i>Nothing to fear at all.</i>

1361
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:49,366
<i>I will personally investigate
the disturbance.</i>

1362
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:51,763
<i>Now everyone, back to your villages</i>

1363
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:54,167
<i>and on with your lives.</i>

1364
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:57,720
<i>But as they made
their way back into the woods,</i>

1365
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:01,524
<i>their familiar paths
were nowhere to be found.</i>

1366
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:05,523
<i>And their lives were about
to take an unexpected turn.</i>

1367
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:07,563
Here, here, watch out.

1368
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:12,169
I'm sure this is the way home.

1369
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:15,122
Everything's so different.

1370
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,001
Oh, look.

1371
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:22,165
Hello, little one.

1372
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:23,561
Hello, Mr. Baker.

1373
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:25,165
Are you all right?

1374
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:27,561
What are you doing here,
with a suitcase?

1375
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:29,564
I'm moving in with my granny.

1376
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:32,087
Our whole village collapsed,
and I couldn't find my mother anywhere,

1377
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:34,083
and now I can't find my granny's cottage.

1378
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:35,366
What do you mean?

1379
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:38,410
Well, I went down the dell,
but I didn't recognize anything.

1380
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:40,005
There was no path!

1381
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:41,680
Where is she?
Where's Granny?

1382
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:43,205
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Calm down, calm down.

1383
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:45,931
We can help you find
Granny's without the path.

1384
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:47,889
Will you just hold him
for a few moments?

1385
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:49,690
- Really?
- Yes.

1386
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:50,841
You'll come with us.

1387
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:53,048
Why does he always cry
when I hold him?

1388
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:55,521
Well, you needn't hold him
as though he was so fragile.

1389
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:57,842
He doesn't want me.
He wants his mother.

1390
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,604
I can't take care
of him all the time.

1391
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:02,570
I will take care of
him when he's older.

1392
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,480
Mind your head.
Watch your heads.

1393
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:05,647
Who might that be?

1394
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:08,441
It's the Steward
and the royal family.

1395
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:12,600
Hello there.

1396
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:13,960
What brings you into the woods?

1397
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:15,326
The royal quarters have been destroyed.

1398
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:16,447
No!

1399
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:18,090
The kingdom is under attack.

1400
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:19,765
What is the royal
family going to do?

1401
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:22,440
How should I know?
I don't make policy, I just carry it out.

1402
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:25,520
I think it best we just go back to the
village. We'll take the girl with us.

1403
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:26,527
Come with us,
you're going to be fine.

1404
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:28,200
You are going to
come with us, all right?

1405
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:32,241
Oh, my God.

1406
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:47,644
It's a giant!

1407
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:50,484
It's a giant woman!

1408
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:55,646
Where is the lad
who killed my husband?

1409
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:58,567
- There is no lad here!
- We haven't seen him!

1410
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:01,851
We will get him
for you right away!

1411
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,843
Don't move!

1412
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:06,800
It was you who destroyed our house,
not an earthquake!

1413
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:10,009
And who destroyed
my house?

1414
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:11,969
I want him!

1415
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:14,480
Here, would you like a blind girl instead?

1416
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:17,842
How dare you?
She wants the boy!

1417
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:20,764
Jack! Oh!

1418
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:22,600
Has anybody seen my Jack?
He ran off again.

1419
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:26,123
Have you seen Jack?
What?

1420
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:27,765
She is looking for him, too.

1421
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:30,287
Give him to me!

1422
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:35,209
Jack is just a lad!

1423
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:37,362
We had no food to eat,

1424
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:40,126
so he sold his cow
in exchange for some magic beans.

1425
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:42,328
The boy!
I want the boy!

1426
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:45,602
You leave my boy alone!

1427
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:47,325
I'm waiting!

1428
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:50,367
Be quiet, woman,
or you'll get us all killed!

1429
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:51,726
You must be quiet!

1430
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:55,327
Flouncing through our kingdom
in your great big clodhoppers...

1431
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:56,561
Let us not anger the giant!

1432
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:58,563
...destroying everything in your path!

1433
01:19:58,720 --> 01:20:01,007
- Let's not anger the giant.
- You're just a big bully!

1434
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:04,403
I'm gonna get my boy and hide him
so you'll never find him!

1435
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:07,211
- You'll never, never, ever...
- Get back, woman!

1436
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:09,481
The boy is hiding in the steeple tower!

1437
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:11,360
- You can find him there!
- Yes!

1438
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:12,401
- That's true!
- Yes!

1439
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:13,971
Yes, we saw him there!

1440
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:18,563
And if he is not,
I will return tonight

1441
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:21,087
and find you.

1442
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:23,925
All of you!

1443
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:38,885
- Are you okay?
- Look.

1444
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:42,527
- What have you done to her?
- What?

1445
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:45,089
I didn't mean to hurt her.

1446
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:47,208
I was just thinking of the greater good.

1447
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:49,609
If we're going to get through this

1448
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:52,684
we're going to do it
if we all stick together.

1449
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:55,411
Some people are cut out to battle giants.

1450
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:57,210
Others are not.

1451
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:59,283
I don't have the constitution.

1452
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:02,967
And as long as I can be of no help,
I'm going to hide.

1453
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:04,121
Let's go.

1454
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:07,407
Everything will work
out fine in the end.

1455
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:09,570
Not always.

1456
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:10,687
Come along.

1457
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,529
I don't know
where they think they're going.

1458
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:15,644
The giant's already destroyed
the entire village.

1459
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:18,565
Only thing left of my garden
are these beans.

1460
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:20,449
What are we going to do now?

1461
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:21,641
We have no choice.

1462
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:24,247
Find the boy
and give her what she wants.

1463
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:26,130
But if We do, she'll kill Jack!

1464
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:29,086
And if we don't,
she'll kill half the kingdom!

1465
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:33,480
We mustn't let her get Jack!

1466
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:35,410
We're not going to.
It's okay.

1467
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:36,925
- You promise?
- I promise.

1468
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:38,485
Just rest.

1469
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:53,245
Rapunzel?

1470
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:55,165
Rapunzel!

1471
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:57,005
You're safe!

1472
01:21:58,160 --> 01:21:59,207
Thank goodness!

1473
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:00,964
Who are you?

1474
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:03,522
Surely you remember.

1475
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:04,927
Oh.

1476
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,161
Of course,

1477
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:08,607
- you don't recognize me.
- Mother?

1478
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:12,402
This is who I truly am,
my dear.

1479
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:14,520
Now you don't have to
be embarrassed by me.

1480
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:16,807
But you must come with me.

1481
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,520
- There is a giant in the land.
- My darling!

1482
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:20,841
Are you all right?

1483
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:22,924
- Why did you run off?
- I was afraid.

1484
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:24,240
- Come with me.
- No, no, no!

1485
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:26,362
She is not going with you.
You will come with me.

1486
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:28,682
I will not come with you.

1487
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:31,524
Well, then, you leave me no choice.

1488
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:32,681
No!

1489
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:36,687
No!

1490
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:42,200
- Oh, my God.
- Wait.

1491
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,324
You are the one who blinded me.

1492
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,525
And locked me in a tower.

1493
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:47,801
To protect you!

1494
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:50,486
And banished me to an island
in the middle of a swamp!

1495
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:53,646
I was just trying to be a good mother.

1496
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:56,485
Rapunzel, no!

1497
01:22:57,560 --> 01:22:59,562
You will never be safe with him!

1498
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:01,165
- Take me away from here.
- No!

1499
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:02,401
Don't you understand?

1500
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:05,007
I never want to see you again!
Ever!

1501
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:07,208
But, Rapunzel, the giant!

1502
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:23,565
<i>No matter what you say</i>

1503
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:26,321
<i>Children won't listen</i>

1504
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:30,411
<i>No matter what you know</i>

1505
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:34,007
<i>Children refuse</i>

1506
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:36,925
<i>To learn</i>

1507
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:41,128
<i>Guide them along the way</i>

1508
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:43,726
<i>Still they don't listen</i>

1509
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:47,769
<i>Children can only grow</i>

1510
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:51,282
<i>From something you love</i>

1511
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:56,441
<i>To something you lose</i>

1512
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:00,601
<i>Jack!</i>

1513
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:02,645
- Jack!
- Jack!

1514
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:03,721
Jack!

1515
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:05,131
Jack, where are you?

1516
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:06,247
Jack!

1517
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:08,245
We're never going to find him.

1518
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:10,600
I think we should fan out.
It will increase our chances.

1519
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:12,449
- I'm not leaving you on your own.
- I'll be all right.

1520
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:13,761
What if we get lost?

1521
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:15,888
We count our steps from right here.

1522
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:17,041
I'll go, too!

1523
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:18,406
No.
You know what?

1524
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:22,246
You are going to stay
right here with the baby.

1525
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:25,404
And we'll be right back.

1526
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:28,609
You would leave our child with her?

1527
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:31,286
He's asleep.
He will be safe with the girl.

1528
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:33,283
I'm very
capable of taking care of the baby.

1529
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:34,361
See?

1530
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:36,807
- What if the giant comes back?
- What if, what if!

1531
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:38,286
500 paces. Go.

1532
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:42,451
- One, two, three...
- Wait, wait, wait.

1533
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:43,921
Here.

1534
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:46,847
Let me give you this.

1535
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:49,691
I don't want you to get cold.

1536
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:50,921
Okay.

1537
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:55,006
One, two, three, four, five...

1538
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:57,367
- Jack!
- Six, seven, eight,

1539
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:59,170
nine, ten...

1540
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:00,805
Jack!

1541
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:08,161
167,168,169,170,171,

1542
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:11,364
172,173,174...

1543
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:16,843
Hello, Your Royal Highness.

1544
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:19,123
Well, hello.

1545
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:20,531
Hello, again.

1546
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:23,001
We've met before, actually.

1547
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:24,885
Yes, of course.

1548
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:26,371
Yes.

1549
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:30,205
You must be here to slay the giant.

1550
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:32,803
- The giant?
- Yes.

1551
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:36,407
Haven't you heard?
We have a giant in our midst.

1552
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:38,970
Not an earthquake.

1553
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:40,401
Of course.

1554
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:42,246
The giant.

1555
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:45,483
It's a lady giant.

1556
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:48,729
Which is very unusual.

1557
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:51,089
I should think so.

1558
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,526
And why are you
alone in the woods?

1559
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:57,923
Um...
Well, I came here with my husband.

1560
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:01,082
And we were...

1561
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:03,368
Well, you see, it's a long story.

1562
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:07,251
And he would let you roam alone
in the woods?

1563
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:10,244
Well, no, actually.
It was my choice.

1564
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:14,166
How brave.

1565
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:15,321
Brave?

1566
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:16,441
Yes.

1567
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:21,687
<i>Anything can happen
in the woods</i>

1568
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:23,441
<i>May I kiss you?</i>

1569
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:27,570
<i>Any moment we could be crushed</i>

1570
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:30,246
<i>- Um...
- Don't feel rushed</i>

1571
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:35,604
<i>This is ridiculous
What am I doing here?</i>

1572
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:38,366
<i>I'm in the wrong story</i>

1573
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:44,364
Wait, wait, wait, we can't do this!
You have a princess!

1574
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:47,251
- Well, yes, I do.
- And I have a baker.

1575
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:50,921
Of course.

1576
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:54,407
You're right.
How foolish.

1577
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:59,041
<i>Foolishness can happen in the woods</i>

1578
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:01,721
<i>- Once again, please
- Um...</i>

1579
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:05,441
<i>Let your hesitations be hushed</i>

1580
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:11,162
<i>Any moment, big or small
ls a moment, after all</i>

1581
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:15,803
<i>Seize the moment, skies may fall
Any moment</i>

1582
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:21,642
But this is not right!

1583
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:27,483
<i>Right and wrong don't matter
in the woods</i>

1584
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:29,485
<i>Only feelings</i>

1585
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:33,401
<i>Let us meet the moment unblushed</i>

1586
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:36,765
<i>Life is often so unpleasant</i>

1587
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:39,002
<i>You must know that, as a peasant</i>

1588
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:41,003
<i>Best to take the moment present</i>

1589
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:45,165
<i>As a present for the moment</i>

1590
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:50,441
476, 477,

1591
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:54,844
478, 479, 480.

1592
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:57,691
481, 482, 483...

1593
01:27:58,200 --> 01:27:59,361
Excuse me, ma'am.

1594
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:02,603
You haven't seen a boy anywhere,
have you?

1595
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:04,524
He's about so high.

1596
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:08,041
I'm sorry, may I be of some service?

1597
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:10,290
The tree has fallen.

1598
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:12,849
Mother's grave, destroyed.

1599
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:15,166
I'm sorry.

1600
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:17,450
I shouldn't complain.

1601
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:20,007
I'm sure others have suffered worse
after the earthquake.

1602
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:23,881
No, no, this isn't an earthquake.

1603
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:27,006
There's a giant terrorizing the kingdom.

1604
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:31,322
Then I'm sure the Prince will see to it
that the giant is rid from our land.

1605
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:33,482
The Prince?

1606
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:36,246
No doubt he's off somewhere
seducing some young maiden.

1607
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:37,727
What?

1608
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,651
You look like the Princess, but dirty.

1609
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:42,401
Oh, my! You are the...

1610
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:44,324
I didn't recognize you, honestly.

1611
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:47,723
No, no. Please, get up.
I'm not a princess here.

1612
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:50,401
I had to disguise myself.

1613
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:53,245
I'm not permitted to leave
the palace unescorted.

1614
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:01,082
If you'd like, you could come with me.

1615
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:05,044
I mean, you'll be safe in our company.

1616
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:06,761
Thank you.

1617
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:12,444
It's this way.
My wife is somewhere.

1618
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:15,126
We decided to walk 500 paces
in one direction...

1619
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:21,249
- I must leave you.
- Oh!

1620
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:25,091
Now I must go
off to slay a giant.

1621
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:32,083
I shall not forget you.

1622
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:36,209
How brave you are
to be alone in the woods.

1623
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:38,806
And how alive you've made me feel.

1624
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:47,962
What was that?

1625
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:54,644
<i>Was that me?
Was that him?</i>

1626
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:58,441
<i>Did a prince really kiss me?</i>

1627
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:03,283
<i>And kiss me?
And kiss me?</i>

1628
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:07,322
<i>And did I kiss him back?</i>

1629
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,651
<i>Was it wrong?
Am I mad?</i>

1630
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:13,320
<i>Is that all?
Does he miss me?</i>

1631
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:16,848
<i>Was he suddenly
Getting bored with me?</i>

1632
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:21,525
<i>Wake up, stop dreaming
Stop prancing about the woods</i>

1633
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:25,811
<i>It's not beseeming
What is it about the woods?</i>

1634
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:29,442
<i>Back to life, back to sense
Back to child, back to husband</i>

1635
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:31,807
<i>No one lives in the woods</i>

1636
01:30:32,640 --> 01:30:34,404
<i>There are vows, there are ties</i>

1637
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:36,130
<i>There are needs, there are standards</i>

1638
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:38,482
<i>There are shouldn'ts and shoulds</i>

1639
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:42,047
<i>Why not both instead?</i>

1640
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:45,363
<i>There's the answer, if you're clever</i>

1641
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:50,366
<i>Have a child for warmth
And a baker for bread</i>

1642
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:54,127
<i>And</i> a <i>prince for whatever</i>

1643
01:30:54,680 --> 01:30:55,761
<i>Never</i>

1644
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:57,444
<i>It's these woods</i>

1645
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:02,807
<i>Face the facts, find the boy
Join the group, stop the giant</i>

1646
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:05,008
<i>Just get out of these woods</i>

1647
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:09,402
<i>Was that him? Yes, it was
Was that me? No, it wasn't</i>

1648
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:11,847
<i>Just a trick of the woods</i>

1649
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:14,882
<i>Just a moment</i>

1650
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:18,847
<i>One peculiar, passing moment</i>

1651
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:21,766
<i>Must it all be either less or more?</i>

1652
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:23,729
<i>Either plain or grand?</i>

1653
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:28,010
<i>Is it always "Or"?
Is it never "And"?</i>

1654
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:31,650
<i>That's what woods are for</i>

1655
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:35,322
<i>For those moments in the woods</i>

1656
01:31:35,480 --> 01:31:39,087
<i>Oh, if life were made of moments</i>

1657
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:42,608
<i>Even now and then a bad one</i>

1658
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:46,082
<i>But if life were only moments</i>

1659
01:31:46,360 --> 01:31:49,762
<i>Then you'd never know you had one</i>

1660
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:54,207
<i>First a witch, then a child
Then a prince, then a moment</i>

1661
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:56,767
<i>Who can live in the woods?</i>

1662
01:31:57,360 --> 01:32:00,762
<i>And to get what you wish
Only just for a moment</i>

1663
01:32:00,920 --> 01:32:03,446
<i>These are dangerous woods</i>

1664
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:07,050
<i>Let the moment go</i>

1665
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:10,688
<i>Don't forget it for a moment, though</i>

1666
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:13,844
<i>Just remembering you've had an "And"</i>

1667
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:16,446
<i>When you're back to "Or"</i>

1668
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:22,640
<i>Makes the "Or" mean more
Than it did before</i>

1669
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:28,371
<i>Now I understand</i>

1670
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:31,291
<i>And it's time to leave the woods</i>

1671
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:36,481
Which way was it?

1672
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:42,811
172,173,174,175...

1673
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:50,086
172,173,174...

1674
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:44,131
She should be back by now.

1675
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:45,201
She wouldn't get lost.

1676
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:46,850
I'm sure she'll return soon.

1677
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,571
I'm going to go and look for her.
Will you?

1678
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:52,643
- Look who I found.
- You're hurting me!

1679
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:54,081
Let go of him!

1680
01:33:54,240 --> 01:33:56,527
I'll let go of him
when I give him to the giant.

1681
01:33:56,680 --> 01:33:58,240
Leave him alone!

1682
01:33:58,360 --> 01:33:59,600
Keep away from him!

1683
01:33:59,720 --> 01:34:01,643
Stop! Stop!
I said stop!

1684
01:34:04,120 --> 01:34:05,804
Where did you find this?

1685
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:09,284
I'm sorry, sir.

1686
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:11,051
It's my wife's.

1687
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:15,450
I'm sorry. I came upon her.
She was at the bottom of a cliff.

1688
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:18,090
What are you saying?

1689
01:34:18,680 --> 01:34:20,091
How awful.

1690
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:21,801
No.

1691
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:24,121
No!

1692
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:27,485
This is all my fault.

1693
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:30,121
I shouldn't have let
her wander off alone.

1694
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,411
I should have
made her stay with me.

1695
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:34,769
Remorse will get you nowhere.

1696
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:36,922
- My wife is dead!
- Wake up!

1697
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:38,366
When you're dead, you're dead.

1698
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:40,727
It's time we get this boy to the giant
before we're all dead.

1699
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:41,881
Keep away from him!

1700
01:34:41,960 --> 01:34:43,928
This is no time
to be soft-hearted!

1701
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:46,321
He's going to the giant
and I'm taking him!

1702
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:48,482
Yes! Yes, he's the one to blame!

1703
01:34:48,640 --> 01:34:52,361
It's because of you there's a giant
in our midst, and my wife is dead!

1704
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:54,807
<i>But it isn't my fault
I was given those beans</i>

1705
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,321
<i>You persuaded me to trade away
My cow for beans</i>

1706
01:34:57,440 --> 01:34:59,568
<i>And without those beans
There'd have been no stalk</i>

1707
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:01,210
<i>To get up to the giants
In the first place</i>

1708
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:02,281
<i>Wait a minute</i>

1709
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:04,408
<i>Magic beans
For a cow so old</i>

1710
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:06,560
<i>That you had to tell a lie to sell it
Which you told</i>

1711
01:35:06,720 --> 01:35:08,768
<i>Were they worthless beans?
Were they oversold?</i>

1712
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:11,082
<i>Oh, and tell us who persuaded you
To steal that gold</i>

1713
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:12,320
<i>- See, it's your fault
- No!</i>

1714
01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:13,440
<i>- Yes, it's your fault
- No!</i>

1715
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:14,561
<i>- Yes, it is
- It's not!</i>

1716
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:15,801
<i>- It's true
- Wait a minute though</i>

1717
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:18,566
<i>I only stole the gold to get my cow back
From you</i>

1718
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:19,640
<i>So it's your fault</i>

1719
01:35:19,680 --> 01:35:20,727
<i>- Yes!
- No, it isn't</i>

1720
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:22,760
<i>I'd have kept those beans
But our house was cursed</i>

1721
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:24,803
<i>She made us get a cow
To get the curse reversed</i>

1722
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,128
<i>It's his father's fault
That the curse got placed</i>

1723
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:29,368
<i>And the place got cursed
In the first place</i>

1724
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:30,680
<i>- Oh, then it's his fault
- So</i>

1725
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:31,847
<i>- It was his fault
- No!</i>

1726
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:32,921
<i>Yes, it is, it's his</i>

1727
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:34,280
<i>- I guess
Wait a minute though</i>

1728
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:36,482
<i>I chopped down the beanstalk
Right, that's clear</i>

1729
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:38,642
<i>But without any beanstalk
Then what's queer</i>

1730
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:41,007
<i>ls how did the second giant
Get down here</i>

1731
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:42,241
<i>In the first place
Second place?</i>

1732
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:43,320
- Yes.
- How?

1733
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:44,566
<i>Well, who had the other bean?</i>

1734
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:45,687
<i>- The other bean?
- The other bean?</i>

1735
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:47,530
<i>- You pocketed the other bean
- I didn't. Yes, I did</i>

1736
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:48,600
<i>So it's your fault</i>

1737
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:50,011
<i>No, it isn't
'Cause I gave it to my wife</i>

1738
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:51,081
<i>- So it's her fault
- No, it isn't</i>

1739
01:35:51,160 --> 01:35:52,241
<i>- Then whose is it?
- Wait a minute</i>

1740
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:54,482
<i>She exchanged that bean
To obtain your shoe</i>

1741
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:56,760
<i>So the one who knows what happened
To the bean is you</i>

1742
01:35:56,840 --> 01:35:58,808
<i>You mean that old bean
That your wife... Oh, dear</i>

1743
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:01,201
<i>But I never knew and so I threw...
Well, don't look here</i>

1744
01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:02,526
<i>- So it's your fault
- But...</i>

1745
01:36:02,680 --> 01:36:03,800
<i>- See, it's her fault
- But...</i>

1746
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:05,046
<i>And it isn't mine at all</i>

1747
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:06,120
<i>But what?</i>

1748
01:36:06,160 --> 01:36:08,003
<i>Well, if you hadn't gone
Back up again</i>

1749
01:36:08,120 --> 01:36:09,120
<i>We were needy</i>

1750
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:10,680
<i>You were greedy
Did you need that hen?</i>

1751
01:36:10,720 --> 01:36:11,881
<i>But I got it for my mother</i>

1752
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:13,041
<i>So it's her fault then</i>

1753
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:14,446
<i>Yes, and what about the harp
In the third place?</i>

1754
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:15,567
<i>The harp, yes</i>

1755
01:36:15,640 --> 01:36:17,085
<i>- She went and dared me to
- I dared you to?</i>

1756
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:18,810
<i>- She said that I was scared
- Me?</i>

1757
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:19,881
<i>- So she dared me
- No, I didn't</i>

1758
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,000
<i>So it's your fault</i>

1759
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:22,485
<i>- Wait a minute
- If you hadn't dared him to</i>

1760
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:23,800
<i>And you had left the harp alone</i>

1761
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:25,609
<i>If you hadn't thrown away the bean
In the first place</i>

1762
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:26,961
<i>If she hadn't raised them
in the first place</i>

1763
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:28,360
<i>If you hadn't raised them
in the first place</i>

1764
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:30,443
<i>- You raised the beans in the first place
- It's your fault</i>

1765
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:31,761
<i>You're responsible
You're the one to blame</i>

1766
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:32,841
<i>It's your fault</i>

1767
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:48,846
<i>It's the last midnight</i>

1768
01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:54,488
<i>It's the last wish</i>

1769
01:36:55,520 --> 01:37:00,526
<i>It's the last midnight</i>

1770
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:06,080
<i>Soon it will be boom
Squish</i>

1771
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:08,761
<i>Told a little lie</i>

1772
01:37:08,920 --> 01:37:11,127
<i>Stole a little gold</i>

1773
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:13,442
<i>Broke a little vow</i>

1774
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:15,446
<i>Did you?</i>

1775
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:17,608
<i>Had to get your prince</i>

1776
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:19,643
<i>Had to get your cow</i>

1777
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:22,087
<i>Had to get your wish
Doesn't matter how</i>

1778
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:24,242
<i>Anyway, it doesn't matter now</i>

1779
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:28,445
<i>It's the last midnight</i>

1780
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:32,366
<i>It's the boom
Splat</i>

1781
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:36,445
<i>Nothing but a vast midnight</i>

1782
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:39,888
<i>Everybody smashed flat</i>

1783
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:42,125
<i>Nothing we can do</i>

1784
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:44,723
<i>Not exactly true</i>

1785
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:46,365
<i>We could always give her the boy</i>

1786
01:37:47,680 --> 01:37:48,681
<i>No, of course</i>

1787
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:52,805
<i>What really matters is the blame
Someone you can blame</i>

1788
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:56,009
<i>Fine, if that's the thing you enjoy
Placing the blame</i>

1789
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:59,448
<i>If that's the aim
Give me the blame</i>

1790
01:38:00,640 --> 01:38:02,927
<i>Just give me the boy</i>

1791
01:38:03,080 --> 01:38:04,206
- No!
- No!

1792
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:05,801
No.

1793
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:11,201
<i>You're so nice</i>

1794
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:13,448
<i>You're not good
You're not bad</i>

1795
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:15,329
<i>You're just nice</i>

1796
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:17,528
<i>I'm not good
I'm not nice</i>

1797
01:38:17,680 --> 01:38:19,603
<i>I'm just right</i>

1798
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:21,444
<i>I'm the Witch</i>

1799
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:26,640
<i>You're the world</i>

1800
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:29,963
<i>I'm the hitch
I'm what no one believes</i>

1801
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:31,804
<i>I'm the Witch</i>

1802
01:38:31,960 --> 01:38:35,521
<i>You're all liars and thieves
Like his father</i>

1803
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,889
<i>Like his son will be, too</i>

1804
01:38:38,120 --> 01:38:40,088
<i>Oh, why bother?</i>

1805
01:38:40,240 --> 01:38:43,687
<i>You'll just do what you do</i>

1806
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:49,085
<i>It's the last midnight
So goodbye, all</i>

1807
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:54,602
<i>Coming at you fast
Midnight</i>

1808
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:58,082
<i>Soon you'll see the sky fall</i>

1809
01:38:58,280 --> 01:38:59,725
<i>Here, you want a bean?</i>

1810
01:39:00,360 --> 01:39:01,725
<i>Have another bean</i>

1811
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:04,522
<i>Beans were made for making you rich</i>

1812
01:39:06,040 --> 01:39:09,169
<i>Plant them and they soar
Here, you want some more?</i>

1813
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:11,403
<i>Listen to the roar
Giants by the score</i>

1814
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:13,449
<i>Oh well, you can blame another witch</i>

1815
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:16,763
<i>It's the last midnight</i>

1816
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:20,682
<i>It's the last verse</i>

1817
01:39:20,840 --> 01:39:24,287
<i>Now, before it's past midnight</i>

1818
01:39:24,440 --> 01:39:27,808
<i>I'm leaving you my last curse</i>

1819
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:29,849
<i>I'm leaving you alone</i>

1820
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:33,527
<i>You can tend the garden, it's yours
Separate and alone</i>

1821
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:37,606
<i>Everybody down on all fours</i>

1822
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:41,685
<i>All right, Mother, when?</i>

1823
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:45,367
<i>Lost the beans again
Punish me the way you did then</i>

1824
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:47,768
<i>Give me claws and a hunch</i>

1825
01:39:47,960 --> 01:39:51,043
<i>Just away from this bunch
And the gloom</i>

1826
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:56,411
<i>And the doom
And the boom</i>

1827
01:39:56,760 --> 01:39:59,161
<i>Crunch!</i>

1828
01:40:20,240 --> 01:40:22,208
Maybe I shouldn't have
stolen from the giant.

1829
01:40:22,360 --> 01:40:24,408
Maybe I shouldn't have
strayed from the path.

1830
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:26,562
Maybe I shouldn't have
attended the Ball.

1831
01:40:27,400 --> 01:40:28,970
Yeah, maybe you shouldn't have.

1832
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:32,007
- Where are you going?
- Away from here.

1833
01:40:32,160 --> 01:40:34,400
But you said we had to find our way
out of this together.

1834
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:36,926
It doesn't matter if we're together
or we're apart.

1835
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:38,127
We need your help.

1836
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:39,725
You don't understand!

1837
01:40:39,880 --> 01:40:42,087
I depended on my wife for everything!

1838
01:40:42,240 --> 01:40:44,129
She was the one who helped.

1839
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:45,566
You would leave your child?

1840
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:49,807
He'll be happier in the arms
of a princess.

1841
01:40:49,880 --> 01:40:50,881
But wait!

1842
01:41:13,120 --> 01:41:14,360
What are you doing here?

1843
01:41:14,440 --> 01:41:15,441
Son...

1844
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:16,760
I don't want to talk to you.

1845
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:17,961
It's because of you all of this happened!

1846
01:41:18,120 --> 01:41:20,407
- Go away!
- I'm sorry. I did a foolish thing.

1847
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:22,841
Why would you do that?
Why did you take the Witch's beans?

1848
01:41:22,920 --> 01:41:24,001
They were there
and I wanted them.

1849
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:25,520
I didn't think.
I was being careless.

1850
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:27,090
- Selfish.
- Yes.

1851
01:41:27,240 --> 01:41:29,208
You stole and you got caught,
and you did what you do.

1852
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:30,521
You just ran away.

1853
01:41:30,680 --> 01:41:32,603
When your mother died, I was...

1854
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:40,683
I hated myself.
I ran away from my guilt and my shame.

1855
01:41:40,840 --> 01:41:42,365
And your son.

1856
01:41:44,360 --> 01:41:45,850
Yes, my son, and I'm sorry for that.

1857
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,440
- Then what do you want?
- Aren't you making the same mistake?

1858
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:49,925
Aren't you running away?

1859
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:53,569
Be better than me,

1860
01:41:54,280 --> 01:41:55,281
son.

1861
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:01,009
Do better.

1862
01:42:40,280 --> 01:42:41,884
See, so this is you,

1863
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:43,485
and you're going to come over here.

1864
01:42:43,640 --> 01:42:45,688
If there were just some way
we could surprise the giant.

1865
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:47,046
She's too tall to surprise.

1866
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:48,884
So, that's why I'm going to
be behind here.

1867
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:50,883
Yeah, and then you can come here,

1868
01:42:51,360 --> 01:42:52,691
climb on top...

1869
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:54,046
I knew you wouldn't give up.

1870
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:56,524
He wouldn't leave his baby.

1871
01:42:56,600 --> 01:42:58,045
It looked like he was going to.

1872
01:43:00,360 --> 01:43:01,850
Give me my son.

1873
01:43:03,200 --> 01:43:04,247
Hey.

1874
01:43:11,640 --> 01:43:13,529
What are we
gonna do now?

1875
01:43:13,680 --> 01:43:15,967
We need to rid this kingdom
of the giant together.

1876
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:19,406
She'll be back soon, so here's the plan.

1877
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:21,244
We're going to feed Jack to the giant.

1878
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:22,640
- What?
- No!

1879
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:24,440
- We're going to use you as bait!
- Bait?

1880
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:27,131
To lure the giant to the tar pit.

1881
01:43:28,520 --> 01:43:29,521
Oh!
The birds can help!

1882
01:43:29,720 --> 01:43:32,485
Good friends, we need your help
now more than ever.

1883
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:35,330
What of the prince?

1884
01:43:37,880 --> 01:43:39,166
That doesn't matter now.

1885
01:43:39,320 --> 01:43:42,210
What's important is that
we find a way to defeat the giant.

1886
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:44,841
Yes!

1887
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:46,407
Thank you, birds!

1888
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:49,604
You can talk to birds?

1889
01:43:50,200 --> 01:43:51,725
The birds will do their part.

1890
01:43:52,120 --> 01:43:54,600
- Okay, we don't have much time.
- I'm excited!

1891
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:57,326
- First, we'll need a weapon.
- I wish I had my sling!

1892
01:43:57,480 --> 01:43:59,005
We can make some.

1893
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:07,248
Your father is being very brave.

1894
01:44:07,880 --> 01:44:09,689
We're going to
be very brave too.

1895
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:11,444
Are you all right, miss?

1896
01:44:13,240 --> 01:44:15,561
The giant went in that direction.

1897
01:44:16,520 --> 01:44:17,885
My darling!

1898
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:20,291
Oh, my darling!

1899
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:23,884
I did not recognize you.
What are you doing here?

1900
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:26,965
And with a child?

1901
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:29,524
You must get back
to the castle at once.

1902
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:30,601
There is a giant on the loose.

1903
01:44:30,760 --> 01:44:32,171
I'm well aware of that.

1904
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:34,325
My love, what is it?

1905
01:44:36,440 --> 01:44:38,647
Maybe I'm not your only love.

1906
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:40,804
I love you! Truly, I do.

1907
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,651
If you love me, why did you stray?

1908
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:46,521
Uh...

1909
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:49,408
I thought that if you were mine,

1910
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:52,522
I would never wish for more.

1911
01:44:55,440 --> 01:44:57,647
If this is how you
behave as a prince,

1912
01:44:57,720 --> 01:44:59,563
what kind of king will you be?

1913
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:03,248
I was raised to be charming, not sincere.

1914
01:45:04,240 --> 01:45:06,129
I think you should go.

1915
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:08,965
Is that what you really wish?

1916
01:45:11,240 --> 01:45:13,527
My father's house was a nightmare.

1917
01:45:13,680 --> 01:45:15,205
Your house a dream.

1918
01:45:17,120 --> 01:45:19,168
Now I want something in-between.

1919
01:45:34,160 --> 01:45:37,562
I shall always love the maiden
who ran away.

1920
01:45:39,080 --> 01:45:41,481
And I the faraway prince.

1921
01:45:55,320 --> 01:45:56,731
Careful.
Not so fast.

1922
01:45:56,880 --> 01:45:59,531
Don't worry.
This is easier than the beanstalk.

1923
01:46:00,240 --> 01:46:02,481
They're up in the tree!
Over there!

1924
01:46:02,640 --> 01:46:04,768
We made slings out of my cape!

1925
01:46:07,720 --> 01:46:09,802
I wanted to climb the tree too.

1926
01:46:10,520 --> 01:46:12,040
Well, I'm glad you're here to help me.

1927
01:46:17,360 --> 01:46:18,361
What's wrong?

1928
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,970
I think my granny and my mother
would be upset with me.

1929
01:46:26,520 --> 01:46:27,521
Why?

1930
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,082
They said to always make them proud.

1931
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:33,046
And here I am, about to kill somebody.

1932
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:37,010
Not somebody.

1933
01:46:37,480 --> 01:46:39,448
A giant who's done a lot of harm.

1934
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:41,250
But a giant is a person.

1935
01:46:43,160 --> 01:46:45,162
Aren't we to show forgiveness?

1936
01:46:48,480 --> 01:46:51,643
<i>Mother cannot guide you</i>

1937
01:46:52,480 --> 01:46:55,563
<i>Now you're on your own</i>

1938
01:46:56,720 --> 01:46:59,610
<i>Only me beside you</i>

1939
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:03,048
<i>Still you're not alone</i>

1940
01:47:04,120 --> 01:47:08,489
<i>No one is alone, truly</i>

1941
01:47:08,640 --> 01:47:11,564
<i>No one is alone</i>

1942
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:13,126
I wish...

1943
01:47:14,280 --> 01:47:15,281
I know.

1944
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:19,160
Wait until my mother hears
I've slain the giant.

1945
01:47:19,320 --> 01:47:20,481
Jack,

1946
01:47:20,920 --> 01:47:22,570
there's something you need to know.

1947
01:47:22,720 --> 01:47:24,324
It's about your mother.

1948
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:25,481
What?

1949
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:31,245
She didn't make it.

1950
01:47:34,520 --> 01:47:36,602
- Was she killed by the giant?
- No.

1951
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:38,609
It wasn't like that.

1952
01:47:38,840 --> 01:47:40,126
She was fighting with the giant,

1953
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:42,009
she was trying to protect you,

1954
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,048
and she was pushed by the Steward.

1955
01:47:45,680 --> 01:47:47,170
And she fell.

1956
01:47:47,320 --> 01:47:49,402
- The Steward will pay for this.
- No, Jack!

1957
01:47:49,560 --> 01:47:51,160
After we slay the giant,
I will slay him!

1958
01:47:51,200 --> 01:47:52,690
You'll do nothing of the kind.

1959
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:56,330
What he did was wrong.
He should be punished.

1960
01:47:57,800 --> 01:47:59,802
It's not as easy as that.

1961
01:48:02,160 --> 01:48:03,844
<i>Mother isn't here now</i>

1962
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:06,048
<i>Wrong things, right things</i>

1963
01:48:06,200 --> 01:48:08,089
<i>Who knows what she'd say?</i>

1964
01:48:08,240 --> 01:48:10,004
<i>Who can say what's true?</i>

1965
01:48:10,160 --> 01:48:11,810
<i>Nothing's quite so clear now</i>

1966
01:48:12,040 --> 01:48:14,088
<i>Do things, fight things</i>

1967
01:48:14,240 --> 01:48:16,083
<i>Feel you've lost your way?</i>

1968
01:48:16,240 --> 01:48:17,287
<i>You decide</i>

1969
01:48:17,360 --> 01:48:20,091
<i>But you are not alone</i>

1970
01:48:20,240 --> 01:48:22,607
<i>Believe me
No one is alone</i>

1971
01:48:22,760 --> 01:48:24,250
<i>No one is alone</i>

1972
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:25,447
<i>Believe me</i>

1973
01:48:25,560 --> 01:48:26,721
<i>Truly</i>

1974
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:28,928
<i>People make mistakes</i>

1975
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:30,201
<i>Fathers</i>

1976
01:48:30,360 --> 01:48:31,360
<i>Mothers</i>

1977
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:33,522
<i>People make mistakes</i>

1978
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:36,606
<i>Holding to their own</i>

1979
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:41,083
<i>Thinking they're alone</i>

1980
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:43,001
<i>Honor their mistakes</i>

1981
01:48:43,120 --> 01:48:44,121
<i>Fight for their mistakes</i>

1982
01:48:44,280 --> 01:48:45,691
<i>Everybody makes</i>

1983
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:49,322
<i>One another's Terrible mistakes</i>

1984
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:51,723
<i>Witches can be right</i>

1985
01:48:51,920 --> 01:48:53,888
<i>Giants can be good</i>

1986
01:48:54,040 --> 01:48:55,883
<i>You decide what's right</i>

1987
01:48:56,200 --> 01:48:58,407
<i>You decide what's good</i>

1988
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:00,130
<i>Just remember</i>

1989
01:49:00,440 --> 01:49:02,568
<i>Just remember</i>

1990
01:49:03,480 --> 01:49:05,642
<i>Someone is on your side</i>

1991
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:06,801
<i>Our side</i>

1992
01:49:06,920 --> 01:49:09,605
<i>Our side
Someone else is not</i>

1993
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:13,808
<i>While we're seeing our side</i>

1994
01:49:13,960 --> 01:49:15,530
<i>- Our side
- Our side</i>

1995
01:49:15,840 --> 01:49:18,366
<i>Maybe we forgot</i>

1996
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:22,049
<i>They are not alone</i>

1997
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:26,721
<i>No one is alone</i>

1998
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:33,243
<i>Someone is on your side</i>

1999
01:49:34,720 --> 01:49:36,290
<i>No one is alo...</i>

2000
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:43,524
Go, Jack.

2001
01:49:43,720 --> 01:49:45,085
- Be careful.
- Yeah.

2002
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:48,805
Here she comes.

2003
01:50:11,640 --> 01:50:14,120
Where is the boy?

2004
01:50:14,280 --> 01:50:15,406
We have him!

2005
01:50:15,560 --> 01:50:16,607
Where?

2006
01:50:16,680 --> 01:50:18,409
He's hiding in that tree!

2007
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:21,571
Here I am!

2008
01:50:40,920 --> 01:50:41,921
You ready?

2009
01:50:42,680 --> 01:50:44,045
Ready!

2010
01:51:02,960 --> 01:51:04,007
Good birds!

2011
01:51:04,080 --> 01:51:05,764
She does not look happy.

2012
01:51:09,120 --> 01:51:10,121
Ooh!

2013
01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:17,682
- Look out, Jack!
- Jack!

2014
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:19,001
Ahh!

2015
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:21,046
Jack!

2016
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:09,927
Jack?

2017
01:52:10,280 --> 01:52:12,567
- Where are they?
- Jack!

2018
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:13,961
Jack!

2019
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:16,085
Mr. Baker!

2020
01:52:17,120 --> 01:52:18,724
- Jack!
- Over here!

2021
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:20,245
Jack!

2022
01:52:20,600 --> 01:52:21,761
Take him!

2023
01:52:21,960 --> 01:52:22,961
Be careful!

2024
01:52:24,200 --> 01:52:25,406
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

2025
01:52:25,560 --> 01:52:26,766
Careful, careful!

2026
01:52:27,920 --> 01:52:29,001
Where is he?

2027
01:52:29,160 --> 01:52:30,240
- He's not with you?
- Jack!

2028
01:52:30,360 --> 01:52:31,407
Mr. Baker!

2029
01:52:31,480 --> 01:52:32,641
Jack!

2030
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:34,921
Help me!

2031
01:52:35,400 --> 01:52:36,765
Jack, I'm here!

2032
01:52:47,120 --> 01:52:49,282
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

2033
01:52:49,680 --> 01:52:50,681
- Okay?
- Yeah!

2034
01:52:50,840 --> 01:52:52,763
You okay?
You all right?

2035
01:52:52,920 --> 01:52:55,002
- Yeah.
- All right? Yeah?

2036
01:52:55,840 --> 01:52:57,205
We did it.

2037
01:52:57,840 --> 01:52:59,205
We did it!

2038
01:53:08,680 --> 01:53:10,364
And now we can return home.

2039
01:53:10,520 --> 01:53:12,841
What home?
I have no one to take care of me.

2040
01:53:13,160 --> 01:53:15,162
And we have nowhere to go.

2041
01:53:15,320 --> 01:53:17,288
So we'll move in with you.

2042
01:53:17,440 --> 01:53:18,805
Well, it's...

2043
01:53:21,040 --> 01:53:22,371
Of course.

2044
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:24,120
Of course you can come
and stay with me.

2045
01:53:24,200 --> 01:53:25,565
And you can come too!

2046
01:53:25,720 --> 01:53:28,724
- Only if you want to.
- I'll gladly help you with your house.

2047
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:30,520
There are times
I actually enjoy cleaning.

2048
01:53:33,040 --> 01:53:34,326
Here.

2049
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:36,887
What's this?

2050
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:43,490
Come on, now.

2051
01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:49,561
I know.

2052
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:54,047
I know, you miss your mother.

2053
01:53:55,720 --> 01:53:57,324
I miss her too.

2054
01:53:59,240 --> 01:54:00,241
Please.

2055
01:54:01,760 --> 01:54:03,922
Maybe I just wasn't
meant to have children.

2056
01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:05,081
Don't say that.

2057
01:54:05,160 --> 01:54:06,446
<i>Of course you were
meant to have children.</i>

2058
01:54:06,600 --> 01:54:10,685
But how can I go about being a father
when I had no father to show me?

2059
01:54:10,840 --> 01:54:13,047
<i>Just calm the child</i>

2060
01:54:13,240 --> 01:54:15,686
<i>Yes, calm the child</i>

2061
01:54:15,840 --> 01:54:18,571
<i>Look, tell him the story
Of how it all happened</i>

2062
01:54:18,720 --> 01:54:21,769
<i>Be father and mother
You'll know what to do</i>

2063
01:54:23,560 --> 01:54:24,561
Alone.

2064
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:29,967
<i>Sometimes people leave you</i>

2065
01:54:31,120 --> 01:54:34,602
<i>Halfway through the wood</i>

2066
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:39,605
<i>Do not let it grieve you</i>

2067
01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:42,969
<i>No one leaves for good</i>

2068
01:54:43,120 --> 01:54:47,125
<i>You are not alone</i>

2069
01:54:47,280 --> 01:54:51,444
<i>No one is alone</i>

2070
01:54:53,320 --> 01:54:57,291
<i>Hold him to the light now</i>

2071
01:54:57,920 --> 01:55:01,447
<i>Let him see the glow</i>

2072
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:06,009
<i>Things will be all right now</i>

2073
01:55:06,480 --> 01:55:10,087
<i>Tell him what you know</i>

2074
01:55:16,760 --> 01:55:19,843
Once upon a time, in a far off kingdom,

2075
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,128
there lay a small village
at the edge of the woods.

2076
01:55:22,280 --> 01:55:24,408
<i>Careful the things you say</i>

2077
01:55:24,600 --> 01:55:27,171
- And <i>in this village...
- Children will listen</i>

2078
01:55:27,320 --> 01:55:29,084
...there lived a young maiden...

2079
01:55:29,240 --> 01:55:31,527
- Careful the <i>things</i> you do
- ...a carefree young lad...

2080
01:55:31,680 --> 01:55:33,489
<i>Children will see</i>

2081
01:55:33,640 --> 01:55:35,449
...and a childless baker...

2082
01:55:35,600 --> 01:55:38,524
<i>And learn</i>

2083
01:55:38,680 --> 01:55:40,444
...with his wife.

2084
01:55:42,640 --> 01:55:44,244
<i>Guide them along the way</i>

2085
01:55:46,160 --> 01:55:48,845
<i>Children will glisten</i>

2086
01:55:49,760 --> 01:55:52,764
<i>Children will look to you</i>

2087
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:56,203
<i>For which way to turn</i>

2088
01:55:56,360 --> 01:56:00,445
<i>To learn what to be</i>

2089
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:06,568
<i>Careful before you say
"Listen to me"</i>

2090
01:56:06,720 --> 01:56:10,566
<i>Children will listen</i>

2091
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:14,682
<i>Careful the wish you make</i>

2092
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:18,327
<i>Wishes are children</i>

2093
01:56:18,480 --> 01:56:21,211
<i>Careful the path they take</i>

2094
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:24,842
<i>Wishes come true</i>

2095
01:56:25,040 --> 01:56:30,729
<i>Not free</i>

2096
01:56:32,080 --> 01:56:35,368
<i>Careful the spell you cast</i>

2097
01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:38,922
<i>Not just on children</i>

2098
01:56:39,080 --> 01:56:42,209
<i>Sometimes the spell may last</i>

2099
01:56:42,280 --> 01:56:45,602
<i>Past what you can see</i>

2100
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:49,890
<i>And turn against you</i>

2101
01:56:50,040 --> 01:56:52,691
<i>Careful the tale you tell</i>

2102
01:56:52,840 --> 01:56:56,162
<i>That is the spell</i>

2103
01:56:56,560 --> 01:57:00,770
<i>Children will listen</i>

2104
01:57:26,040 --> 01:57:27,883
<i>Though it's fearful
Though it's deep, though it's dark</i>

2105
01:57:27,960 --> 01:57:29,689
<i>And though you may lose the path</i>

2106
01:57:29,760 --> 01:57:31,524
<i>Though you may encounter wolves</i>

2107
01:57:31,680 --> 01:57:33,648
<i>You can't just act</i>

2108
01:57:33,880 --> 01:57:35,848
<i>You have to listen</i>

2109
01:57:35,920 --> 01:57:38,321
<i>You can't just act
You have to think</i>

2110
01:57:38,400 --> 01:57:40,402
<i>There are always wolves
There are always spells</i>

2111
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:42,687
<i>There are always beans
or a giant dwells, and so</i>

2112
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:44,609
<i>Into the woods you go again</i>

2113
01:57:44,680 --> 01:57:46,523
<i>You have to every now and then</i>

2114
01:57:46,600 --> 01:57:48,409
<i>Into the woods, no telling when</i>

2115
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:50,130
<i>Be ready for the journey</i>

2116
01:57:50,440 --> 01:57:52,169
<i>Into the woods, but not too fast</i>

2117
01:57:52,320 --> 01:57:54,209
<i>For what you wish, you lose at last</i>

2118
01:57:54,360 --> 01:57:56,124
<i>Into the woods, but mind the past</i>

2119
01:57:56,200 --> 01:57:58,043
<i>Into the woods, but mind the future</i>

2120
01:57:58,120 --> 01:58:00,043
<i>Into the woods, but not to stray</i>

2121
01:58:00,120 --> 01:58:01,724
<i>Or tempt the wolf
Or steal from the giant</i>

2122
01:58:01,800 --> 01:58:03,564
<i>The way is dark</i>

2123
01:58:03,680 --> 01:58:05,250
<i>The light is dim</i>

2124
01:58:05,480 --> 01:58:08,848
<i>But now there's you, me, her, and him</i>

2125
01:58:09,320 --> 01:58:11,084
<i>The chances look small</i>

2126
01:58:11,160 --> 01:58:12,810
<i>The choices look grim</i>

2127
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:14,968
<i>But everything you learn there</i>

2128
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:16,724
<i>Will help when you return there</i>

2129
01:58:16,840 --> 01:58:18,604
<i>The light is getting dimmer</i>

2130
01:58:18,680 --> 01:58:20,603
<i>I think I see a glimmer</i>

2131
01:58:28,200 --> 01:58:29,770
<i>Into the woods you have to grope</i>

2132
01:58:29,880 --> 01:58:31,803
<i>But that's the way you learn to cope</i>

2133
01:58:31,880 --> 01:58:33,564
<i>Into the woods to find this hope</i>

2134
01:58:33,640 --> 01:58:35,449
<i>Of getting through the journey</i>

2135
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:37,170
<i>Into the woods, each time you go</i>

2136
01:58:37,240 --> 01:58:39,242
<i>There's more to learn of what you know</i>

2137
01:58:39,320 --> 01:58:41,129
<i>Into the woods, but not too slow</i>

2138
01:58:41,200 --> 01:58:43,089
<i>Into the woods, it's nearing midnight</i>

2139
01:58:43,160 --> 01:58:44,810
<i>Into the woods to mind the wolf</i>

2140
01:58:44,880 --> 01:58:46,644
<i>To heed the witch
To honor the giant</i>

2141
01:58:46,720 --> 01:58:48,643
<i>To mind, to heed, to find, to think</i>

2142
01:58:48,720 --> 01:58:50,449
<i>To teach, to join, to go to the Festival!</i>

2143
01:58:50,560 --> 01:58:54,246
<i>Into the woods</i>

2144
01:58:54,320 --> 01:58:59,850
<i>Into the woods, then out of the woods</i>

2145
01:58:59,920 --> 01:59:01,649
<i>And happy ever after</i>

2146
01:59:01,720 --> 01:59:03,131
<i>I wish...</i>
