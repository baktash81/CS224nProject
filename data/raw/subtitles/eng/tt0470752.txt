00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:56,546
How long until
we get to his estate?

3
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,455
We've been flying over his
estate for the past two hours.

4
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:31,712
You're leaving me here?

5
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:34,880
This is as close as I'm allowed
to get to the building.

6
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:36,656
What building?

7
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,686
Follow the river.

8
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:40,617
Got it.

9
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:42,788
Keep your head down and
get clear of the rotors.

10
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:43,956
Okay.

11
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:43,813
<i>Caleb Smith.</i>

12
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,115
Yes.

13
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,918
<i>Please approach the console</i>
<i>and face the screen.</i>

14
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,369
Oh!

15
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,205
<i>Take your keycard.</i>

16
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:08,906
<i>You may now</i>
<i>enter the residence.</i>

17
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:48,611
Hello?

18
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:03,959
Hello?

19
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:50,282
Caleb Smith.

20
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:51,974
Hey.

21
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:55,078
Dude!

22
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:58,323
I've been so looking forward
to this week with you.

23
00:05:58,491 --> 00:05:59,686
Come in. Come on in.

24
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,749
Thanks.

25
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:04,492
You want something to eat or
drink after your journey?

26
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:05,896
No. No, thanks, I'm fine. Sure?

27
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:07,059
Yeah.

28
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,534
To be honest,
I thought we'd have, uh,

29
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,695
breakfast together,
but, um...

30
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:13,796
I can't really
eat anything.

31
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,900
I got the mother of all
fucking hangovers. Oh, yeah?

32
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:17,968
Oh, my God, like you
wouldn't even believe.

33
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,774
When I have
a heavy night,

34
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:21,371
I, uh, compensate
the next morning.

35
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:24,509
Exercise. Anti-oxidants.
You know?

36
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:26,252
Yeah, sure.

37
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:32,285
Was it a good party?

38
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:35,054
Party?
Yeah. Wasn't there a party?

39
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,228
There wasn't a party.

40
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:40,289
Sorry.

41
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:43,894
Caleb, I'm just gonna throw this
out there, so it's said, okay?

42
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:44,994
You're freaked out.

43
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,835
I am? Yeah. You're freaked out,

44
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,101
by the helicopter

45
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:49,472
and the mountains
and the house,

46
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:50,942
because it's all
so super-cool.

47
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:52,741
You're freaked out by me,
to be meeting me,

48
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:55,509
having this conversation in this
room, at this moment. Right?

49
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:59,019
And I get that. I get the
moment you're having, but...

50
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:00,884
Dude, can we just
get past that?

51
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:03,613
Can we just be two guys?
Nathan and Caleb.

52
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,421
Not the whole
employer-employee thing.

53
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,692
Yeah, okay.
Yeah?

54
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:09,957
Yes. Uh, yeah.

55
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:12,557
It's good to
meet you, Nathan.

56
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,259
It's good to
meet you, too, Caleb.

57
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,905
I guess the first thing I
should do is explain your pass.

58
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:21,464
Now, it's simple enough.

59
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,701
It opens some doors
and it doesn't open others.

60
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,473
And that just makes everything
easy for you, right?

61
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:26,569
Uh, yes.

62
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,478
Yeah, 'cause you're like, "Oh,
fuck, I'm in someone else's house.

63
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:29,777
"Can I do this,
can I do that?"

64
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:31,909
And this card, it just
takes all that worry away.

65
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:35,217
If you try a door and it stays
shut, okay, it's off-limits.

66
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:38,554
You try another door and it
opens, then it's for you.

67
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,355
Let's try this one.

68
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,426
I guess
it's for you, Caleb.

69
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,274
You like?
Yeah.

70
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:56,867
It's your room.

71
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:58,807
You got a bed here.

72
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,673
A bathroom
right back here.

73
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:03,182
Little desk.

74
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:04,581
Cupboards.

75
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:09,279
Little fridge.

76
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,314
Cozy, right?

77
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:13,792
Yeah, this is great.

78
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,556
What?
Sorry?

79
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,193
There's something wrong.
What's wrong?

80
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:19,626
There's nothing wrong.

81
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:23,300
It's the windows.

82
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,995
You're thinking
there's no windows.

83
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,498
It's subterranean.

84
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:29,600
It's not cozy,
it's claustrophobic.

85
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,406
No. No way. I wasn't
thinking that.

86
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:34,107
I was thinking,
"This is really cool."

87
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:38,745
Caleb, there's a reason there
are no windows in this room.

88
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:40,183
There is?
Uh-huh.

89
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:42,513
This building
isn't a house.

90
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:44,581
It's a research facility.

91
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:47,690
Buried in these walls
is enough fiber optic cable

92
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:50,094
to reach the moon
and lasso it.

93
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:53,598
And I want to talk to you
about what I'm researching,

94
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,134
I want to share it with you.

95
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:59,536
In fact, I want to share it with you
so much, it's eating me up inside.

96
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,673
But there's something I need
you to do for me first.

97
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:10,543
"Blue Book
non-disclosure agreement."

98
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:12,274
Hmm.

99
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,082
Take your time.
Read it over.

100
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,090
"The signee agrees
to regular data audit

101
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,525
"with unlimited access,

102
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:22,261
"to confirm that
no disclosure

103
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,524
"of information
has taken place

104
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:26,862
"in public
or private forums,

105
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,259
"using any means
of communication,

106
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:31,099
"including but not limited

107
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:33,231
"to that which is
disclosed orally

108
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,532
"or in written
or electronic form."

109
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:40,773
I think I need a lawyer.

110
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:43,908
It's standard. It doesn't
feel very standard.

111
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:45,914
Okay, it's not standard.

112
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:48,784
What can I tell you, Caleb?
You don't have to sign it.

113
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:50,323
You know, we can spend
the next few days

114
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,518
just shooting pool,
getting drunk together.

115
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,821
Bonding.

116
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:57,395
And when you discover what you've
missed out on, in about a year,

117
00:09:57,464 --> 00:10:00,662
you're gonna regret it
for the rest of your life.

118
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:09,398
Good call.

119
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:18,307
So,

120
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:21,714
do you know what
the Turing Test is?

121
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:26,485
Yeah.

122
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,718
I know what
the Turing Test is.

123
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:35,134
It's when a human
interacts with a computer.

124
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:36,729
And if the human
doesn't know

125
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,238
they're interacting
with a computer,

126
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,295
the test is passed.

127
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:43,076
And what does
a pass tell us?

128
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:46,204
That the computer has
artificial intelligence.

129
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,805
Are you building an AI?

130
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:50,949
I've already built one.

131
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,245
And over the next few days,

132
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:55,917
you're gonna be the human
component in a Turing Test.

133
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:59,455
Holy shit. Yeah, that's right, Caleb.
You got it.

134
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,792
Because if
that test is passed,

135
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:05,765
you are dead center

136
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:08,597
of the greatest scientific
event in the history of man.

137
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:10,964
If you've created
a conscious machine,

138
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,438
it's not the history of man.

139
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,101
That's the history of gods.

140
00:12:58,911 --> 00:12:59,901
Hello.

141
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:03,472
Hi.

142
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,483
I'm Caleb.

143
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:10,056
Hello, Caleb.

144
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:14,184
Do you have a name?

145
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:16,087
Yes.

146
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:18,456
Ava.

147
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,999
I'm pleased
to meet you, Ava.

148
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:24,931
I'm pleased
to meet you, too.

149
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:29,107
I've never met
anyone new before.

150
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:31,242
Only Nathan.

151
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:35,878
Then I guess we're both
in quite a similar position.

152
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:38,417
Haven't you met
lots of new people before?

153
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:40,910
None like you.

154
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,179
Hmm.

155
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:47,319
So we need
to break the ice.

156
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:50,389
Do you know what I mean by that?
Yes.

157
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,726
What do I mean?

158
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:54,324
Overcome initial
social awkwardness.

159
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,368
So let's have
a conversation.

160
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,497
<i>Okay.</i>

161
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:02,969
<i>What would you like to have</i>
<i>a conversation about?</i>

162
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:05,602
Why don't we start with you telling
me something about yourself?

163
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:08,240
What would you
like to know?

164
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:10,211
Whatever comes
into your head.

165
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:13,549
Well, you already
know my name.

166
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:17,053
And you can see
that I'm a machine.

167
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,755
Would you like to know how old I am?
Sure.

168
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:21,116
I'm one.

169
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:22,724
One what?

170
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,622
One year or one day?
One.

171
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,734
When did you learn
how to speak, Ava?

172
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:35,099
<i>I always knew</i>
<i>how to speak,</i>

173
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,007
<i>and that's strange,</i>
<i>isn't it?</i>

174
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:39,570
Why?

175
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:43,210
Because language is something
that people acquire.

176
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,146
Well,
some people believe

177
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,812
language exists
from birth.

178
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:50,588
And what is learned is the
ability to attach words

179
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:53,057
and structure to the latent ability.
Do you agree with that?

180
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:54,994
<i>I don't know.</i>

181
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:59,188
<i>Will you come back</i>
<i>tomorrow, Caleb?</i>

182
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:01,292
<i>Yes.</i>

183
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:06,934
<i>Good.</i>

184
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:16,941
Oh, man,
she's fascinating.

185
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,610
When you talk to her,
you're just...

186
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,321
Through the looking glass.

187
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,323
"Through the looking glass."
Wow.

188
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:27,559
You're good with words, Caleb.
You're quotable.

189
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,889
Actually, that's
someone else's quote.

190
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:31,863
You know, I wrote down that
other line you came up with.

191
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,058
The one about how

192
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:34,964
if I've invented a machine
with consciousness,

193
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:36,525
I'm not a man, I'm God.

194
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:37,865
I don't think
that's exactly what I...

195
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,099
I just thought, "Fuck,
man, that is so good."

196
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:42,642
When we get to
tell the story. You know?

197
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,404
I turned to Caleb,

198
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:47,112
and he looked up at me
and he said,

199
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,478
"You're not a man,
you're God."

200
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:49,948
Yeah,
but I didn't say that.

201
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:51,743
So...

202
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:53,047
Anyway.

203
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:56,945
You're impressed.

204
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:59,216
Yes. Yes.

205
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:02,291
Although...
Although?

206
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:04,627
There's a qualification
to you being impressed?

207
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:07,223
No, there's no
qualification to her.

208
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,929
Uh, it's just
in the Turing Test,

209
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:12,171
the machine should be
hidden from the examiner.

210
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:13,831
No, no, no,
we're way past that.

211
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,272
If I hid Ava from you,

212
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:17,640
so you just heard her voice,
she would pass for human.

213
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,612
The real test is to show you
that she's a robot

214
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,479
and then see if you still
feel she has consciousness.

215
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:24,608
Mmm.

216
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,076
Yeah, I think
you're probably right.

217
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:32,486
Her language abilities,
they're incredible.

218
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:36,518
The system is stochastic.
Right?

219
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,431
It's non-deterministic.

220
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:40,660
At first I thought
she was mapping

221
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:43,532
from internal semantic form
to syntactic tree-structure

222
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:44,832
and then getting
linearized words.

223
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:47,703
But then I started to realize the
model was some kind of hybrid.

224
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:48,968
Caleb.

225
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:50,632
No?

226
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:54,112
I understand that you want
me to explain how Ava works.

227
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,342
But I'm sorry, I'm not
gonna be able to do that.

228
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:59,146
Try me. I'm hot
on high-level abstraction.

229
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:02,017
It's not because I think
you're too dumb.

230
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:04,247
It's because I want to have a
beer and a conversation with you.

231
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:05,347
Not a seminar.

232
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:07,825
Yeah. Sorry.

233
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:10,628
No, it's okay.
You're all right.

234
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,925
Just...

235
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,625
Answer me this.

236
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,395
How do you feel
about her?

237
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:21,202
Nothing analytical.

238
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:23,805
Just how do you feel?

239
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:25,805
I feel

240
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:30,608
that she's fucking amazing.

241
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:33,111
Dude.

242
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,110
Cheers.

243
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,118
Cheers.

244
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:17,124
Damn it.

245
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:44,850
What the fuck?

246
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:37,037
<i>- Power cut.</i>
<i>- Backup power activated.</i>

247
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:51,417
<i>Full facility lock-down until
main generator is restored.</i>

248
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,152
You're kidding me.

249
00:19:57,096 --> 00:20:00,863
<i>Full facility lock-down until
main generator is restored.</i>

250
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:08,130
<i>Power restored.</i>

251
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:21,169
Hello?

252
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,833
<i>Please insert keycard.</i>

253
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:50,938
You don't have access
to use the phone.

254
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:52,834
Hey.

255
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:57,714
Sorry, but you understand,
though, given Ava,

256
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:00,952
and you being
kind of an unknown.

257
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:03,751
I mean, a great guy.

258
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:07,021
Instant pals, and so on.

259
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:14,365
Who are you gonna call?

260
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:15,731
Oh.

261
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:17,429
I don't know.
No one, really.

262
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:18,732
Ghostbusters.
What?

263
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:21,865
Who are you gonna call?
Ghostbusters. It's a...

264
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:25,271
It's a movie, man.

265
00:22:27,413 --> 00:22:29,109
You don't know that movie?

266
00:22:30,616 --> 00:22:33,108
A ghost gives
Dan Aykroyd oral sex.

267
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:38,221
I was just wondering
how the phone worked.

268
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:40,383
That's all.

269
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,289
So what are you doing
awake at this time?

270
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:45,229
You come to join the party?

271
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:47,729
Uh, something happened
in my room.

272
00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:50,135
Some kind of power cut.

273
00:22:50,636 --> 00:22:52,298
So I came to see
what's going on.

274
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,999
The power cuts, yeah.

275
00:22:54,073 --> 00:22:57,305
We've been getting
those recently. Um...

276
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,873
I'm working on it.

277
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:03,683
I couldn't open the
door to my bedroom.

278
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:05,183
That's a security measure.

279
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:08,116
Automatic lock-down.
Otherwise,

280
00:23:08,187 --> 00:23:11,487
anybody could just open the place
up by disabling the juice.

281
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,794
If it happens again, relax.
Okay?

282
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,557
Sure.

283
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:22,401
Sweet dreams.

284
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:56,630
Oh.

285
00:24:23,362 --> 00:24:24,421
Hey.

286
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:25,723
Hey, man.
Good morning.

287
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:29,166
Good morning. Sorry I had
to send Kyoko to wake you,

288
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:30,862
but I didn't want too much
of the day to slip by.

289
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:33,235
Yeah, I know. It was a good thing.
Thanks.

290
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,331
She's some
alarm clock, huh?

291
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:37,638
Gets you right up
in the morning.

292
00:24:38,344 --> 00:24:40,142
So Day 2. You ready?

293
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,803
What's the plan? Hit me.

294
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,872
Yeah, well, I'm not sure.

295
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:47,320
I'm still trying to, uh, figure
the examination formats.

296
00:24:47,386 --> 00:24:48,684
Uh-huh.

297
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:50,484
Yeah, it feels like

298
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:54,421
testing Ava through conversation
is kind of a closed loop.

299
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,390
It's a closed loop?
Yeah.

300
00:24:56,462 --> 00:24:58,363
Like testing
a chess computer

301
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,296
by only playing chess.

302
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,428
How else do you test
a chess computer?

303
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,569
Well, it depends.

304
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:07,765
You know, I mean,
you can play it

305
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,241
to find out if it makes
good moves, but, uh...

306
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:13,678
But that won't
tell you if it knows

307
00:25:13,746 --> 00:25:15,112
that it's playing chess.

308
00:25:15,314 --> 00:25:18,148
And it won't tell you
if it knows what chess is.

309
00:25:18,484 --> 00:25:20,510
Uh-huh. So it's
simulation versus actual.

310
00:25:20,586 --> 00:25:21,952
Yes. Yeah.

311
00:25:22,388 --> 00:25:25,187
And I think being able to
differentiate between those two

312
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,191
is the Turing Test
you want me to perform.

313
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:29,819
Look, do me a favor. Lay
off the textbook approach.

314
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:32,524
I just want simple answers
to simple questions.

315
00:25:32,965 --> 00:25:34,661
Yesterday I asked you
how you felt about her

316
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:36,361
and you gave me
a great answer.

317
00:25:37,136 --> 00:25:38,900
Now the question is,

318
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:42,267
how does she feel
about you?

319
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,543
What do you think?

320
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:56,178
What is it
a drawing of?

321
00:25:57,156 --> 00:25:58,681
Don't you know?

322
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:01,360
No. I thought you would tell me.

323
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:04,253
Don't you know?

324
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:08,657
I do drawings every day.

325
00:26:09,368 --> 00:26:11,769
But I never know
what they're of.

326
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,666
Are you not trying to
sketch something specific?

327
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:18,573
Like an object
or a person?

328
00:26:22,448 --> 00:26:24,212
Maybe you could try.

329
00:26:26,452 --> 00:26:27,579
Okay.

330
00:26:29,655 --> 00:26:31,681
What object should I draw?

331
00:26:32,491 --> 00:26:35,017
Whatever you want.
It's your decision.

332
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:36,858
Why is it my decision?

333
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:39,728
I'm interested to see
what you'll choose.

334
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,148
Do you want
to be my friend?

335
00:27:04,857 --> 00:27:05,847
Of course.

336
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,756
Will it be possible?

337
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:09,288
Why would it not be?

338
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:12,195
Our conversations
are one-sided.

339
00:27:12,598 --> 00:27:15,966
You ask circumspect questions
and study my responses.

340
00:27:17,703 --> 00:27:18,693
Yes.

341
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,432
You learn about me

342
00:27:20,606 --> 00:27:22,871
and I learn nothing
about you.

343
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:26,139
That's not a foundation on
which friendships are based.

344
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,612
So what? You want me
to talk about myself?

345
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,675
Yes.

346
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:34,481
Where...

347
00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:37,088
Okay, where do I start?

348
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,220
It's your decision.

349
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:43,518
I'm interested to see
what you'll choose.

350
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:44,922
Hmm.

351
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:48,058
Okay, Ava.

352
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:51,328
Well,

353
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:53,700
you know my name.

354
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:56,064
Yes.
I'm 26.

355
00:27:56,909 --> 00:27:59,003
I work at Nathan's company.

356
00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:01,511
Do you know
what his company is?

357
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,912
Blue Book.

358
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:06,144
Named after
Wittgenstein's notes.

359
00:28:06,218 --> 00:28:09,052
It's the world's most popular
internet search engine,

360
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:13,388
processing an average of 94% of
all internet search requests.

361
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:16,558
That's exactly right.

362
00:28:17,963 --> 00:28:20,125
Where do you live, Caleb?

363
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,502
Brookhaven, Long Island.

364
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:28,567
Is it nice there?

365
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:30,339
It's okay.

366
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:33,640
I got an apartment.
It's kind of small.

367
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:35,713
It's very small.

368
00:28:35,781 --> 00:28:38,580
But, uh, it's a five-minute
walk to the office

369
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:41,245
and a five-minute
walk to the ocean,

370
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,788
which I like.

371
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:44,813
Are you married?

372
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:47,584
Um...

373
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:49,220
No.

374
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:52,128
Is your status single?

375
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:55,526
Yes.

376
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:58,035
What about your family?

377
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:01,272
I grew up
in Portland, Oregon.

378
00:29:02,174 --> 00:29:03,665
No brothers or sisters.

379
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:07,143
My parents were both
high school teachers.

380
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:09,576
And if we're getting
to know each other,

381
00:29:09,648 --> 00:29:11,742
I guess I should tell you
they're both dead.

382
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:15,454
Car crash when I was 15.

383
00:29:16,188 --> 00:29:18,555
In fact, I was
in the car with them.

384
00:29:18,624 --> 00:29:19,990
Back seat.

385
00:29:20,659 --> 00:29:23,720
But it was the front
that got the worst of it.

386
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,728
I'm sorry.

387
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,533
It's all right.

388
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:32,329
I spent a long time
in the hospital afterward.

389
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:34,401
Like nearly a year.

390
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,506
And I got into coding.

391
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:40,737
And by the time I got to
college, I was pretty advanced.

392
00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:44,342
An advanced programmer.

393
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:46,176
Yes.

394
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:48,781
Like Nathan.

395
00:29:48,854 --> 00:29:49,947
Yes.

396
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:51,579
No.

397
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:54,420
It's different.

398
00:29:54,493 --> 00:29:57,827
Nathan wrote the Blue Book
base code when he was 13.

399
00:29:58,263 --> 00:29:59,663
Which, if you
understand code,

400
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:02,326
what he did was like
Mozart or something.

401
00:30:02,401 --> 00:30:04,097
Do you like Mozart?

402
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:05,364
I like Depeche Mode.

403
00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:06,735
Do you like Nathan?

404
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:11,899
Yes, of course.

405
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,172
Is Nathan your friend?
My friend?

406
00:30:14,246 --> 00:30:15,578
I... Yeah, I hope so.

407
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,138
A good friend?

408
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:19,145
Um, yeah.

409
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:20,879
Well, no, no, no,
I mean, not a good friend.

410
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:23,148
A good friend is, uh...

411
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:25,850
We only just met
each other, you know.

412
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:28,619
So it takes time
to be able to, um...

413
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:31,556
To get to know
each other, I guess.

414
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:34,327
<i>- Power cut.</i>
<i>- Backup power activated.</i>

415
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:55,813
Caleb.

416
00:31:02,661 --> 00:31:04,152
You're wrong.

417
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,758
Wrong about what?

418
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:08,059
Nathan.

419
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,201
In what way?

420
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:15,702
He isn't your friend.

421
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,141
Excuse me?

422
00:31:21,513 --> 00:31:24,005
I'm sorry, Ava,
I don't understand.

423
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,419
You shouldn't trust him.

424
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:31,248
You shouldn't trust
anything he says.

425
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,485
<i>Power restored.</i>

426
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:38,928
And if we made
a list of books

427
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:40,863
or works of art
which we both know,

428
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:43,800
it would form the ideal
basis of a discussion.

429
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,394
Is that okay?

430
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:49,634
Caleb?

431
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:52,000
Mmm-hmm.

432
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:53,067
Yeah.

433
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:56,507
Good.

434
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:03,480
Thank you.

435
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:07,590
Oh, shit! Are you
fucking kidding me?

436
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,258
Did it get on you?
No, no, it's, uh...

437
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:12,052
It's all right.
I got it.

438
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:13,630
Dude, you're wasting
your time talking to her.

439
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:15,826
She doesn't understand English.
Just give her the napkin.

440
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:19,431
Sorry.

441
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:22,269
It's like a firewall
against leaks.

442
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,002
It means I can talk
trade secrets over dinner

443
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:26,169
and know
it'll go no further.

444
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:27,678
It also means that
I can't tell her that

445
00:32:27,746 --> 00:32:29,476
I'm pissed when she's
so fucking clumsy

446
00:32:29,548 --> 00:32:31,414
that she spills wine
over my house guest.

447
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:33,485
I think she gets
that you're pissed.

448
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:35,885
Yeah? Good.
Because I am pissed.

449
00:32:36,488 --> 00:32:37,854
Hey, Kyoko.

450
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:39,551
Go-go.

451
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:49,632
It's funny.

452
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:51,264
You know.

453
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,730
No matter
how rich you get,

454
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:57,707
shit goes wrong. You can't
insulate yourself from it.

455
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:02,540
I used to think it was death
and taxes you couldn't avoid,

456
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:04,674
but it's actually
death and shit.

457
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:06,843
It's like these
power cuts.

458
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:10,246
You would not believe how much I
spent on the generator system,

459
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:12,223
but I keep getting
failures every day.

460
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:13,584
Do you know
why they happen?

461
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:14,717
No.

462
00:33:14,793 --> 00:33:16,386
The system was supposed
to be bulletproof,

463
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:18,828
but obviously the guys that
installed it fucked something up.

464
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:21,691
Can't you just get them
to come back?

465
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:24,161
No. There's too much
classified stuff here.

466
00:33:24,236 --> 00:33:26,705
So after the job was done,
I just had them all killed.

467
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:32,835
Anyway.

468
00:33:32,911 --> 00:33:35,005
Here's to your
second day, buddy.

469
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,043
Cheers.

470
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,545
Cheers.

471
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:45,523
So how did it go? What
do you have to report?

472
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:50,856
You saw how the day went,
didn't you?

473
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,131
I mean, I assume
you're, uh,

474
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,027
watching on the CCTV.

475
00:33:56,101 --> 00:33:58,935
Sure. But I want to
hear your take on it.

476
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:05,537
Yeah, there was one interesting
thing that happened with Ava today.

477
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,037
Yeah?
Yeah.

478
00:34:13,485 --> 00:34:15,078
She made a joke.

479
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:20,521
Right. When she threw
your line back at you.

480
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:23,752
About being interested
to see what she'd choose.

481
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:25,023
Yeah, I noticed that, too.

482
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:27,691
Yeah, and it got me
thinking, it's, uh...

483
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,635
In a way, it's the
best indication of AI

484
00:34:30,702 --> 00:34:32,796
that I've seen
in her so far.

485
00:34:32,871 --> 00:34:35,033
It's discretely complicated.

486
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:38,204
It's like, um...
It's kind of non-autistic.

487
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:39,909
What do you mean?

488
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:42,004
She could only do that
with an awareness

489
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,015
of her own mind,

490
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:46,683
and also
an awareness of mine.

491
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:49,152
Oh, she's aware
of you all right.

492
00:34:52,357 --> 00:34:53,848
And what about
the power cut?

493
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,961
Sorry?
The power cut.

494
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:01,923
It's the only part
that I couldn't see.

495
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,629
Cameras fail,
I lose audio, the works.

496
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:08,900
So what happened?

497
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:14,674
Nothing.

498
00:35:14,913 --> 00:35:18,475
Nothing? She didn't
remark on it at all?

499
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:23,813
No.

500
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:26,889
Not really.

501
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:31,256
Oh.

502
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:19,035
Hey.

503
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:21,270
Hey.

504
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:24,279
You want to see
something cool?

505
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:35,856
This is where
Ava was created.

506
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:40,496
Go ahead.
Take a look.

507
00:36:50,442 --> 00:36:51,603
Sorry.

508
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:54,345
If you knew
the trouble I had

509
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:57,871
getting an AI to read and
duplicate facial expressions.

510
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,548
You know how
I cracked it?

511
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:03,213
I don't know
how you did any of this.

512
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:06,590
Every cell phone,
just about,

513
00:37:06,658 --> 00:37:10,095
has a microphone, camera and
a means to transmit data.

514
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:14,428
So I turned on every
microphone and camera

515
00:37:14,499 --> 00:37:16,365
across the entire
fucking planet

516
00:37:16,768 --> 00:37:19,704
and I redirected the data
through Blue Book. Boom!

517
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:24,336
Limitless resource of vocal
and facial interaction.

518
00:37:24,476 --> 00:37:26,411
You hacked
the world's cell phones?

519
00:37:26,478 --> 00:37:30,040
Yeah. And all the manufacturers
knew I was doing it, too.

520
00:37:30,215 --> 00:37:31,239
But they couldn't accuse me

521
00:37:31,316 --> 00:37:34,809
without admitting they
were doing it themselves.

522
00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:38,148
Here,

523
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:40,651
we have her mind.

524
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,722
Structured gel.

525
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:46,297
I had to get away
from circuitry.

526
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:47,730
I needed something
that could

527
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:50,597
arrange and rearrange
on a molecular level,

528
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:52,967
but keep its form
when required.

529
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:54,505
Holding for memories.

530
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:56,097
Shifting for thoughts.

531
00:37:57,742 --> 00:37:59,233
This is your hardware?

532
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:01,607
Wetware.

533
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:05,806
And the, uh, software?

534
00:38:06,718 --> 00:38:08,744
Well, I'm sure
you can guess.

535
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:10,577
Blue Book.

536
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:14,720
Here's the weird thing
about search engines.

537
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:16,193
It was like

538
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:20,488
striking oil in a world that hadn't
invented internal combustion.

539
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:23,200
Too much raw material. Nobody
knew what to do with it.

540
00:38:23,568 --> 00:38:25,560
You see, my competitors,

541
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:27,128
they were fixated
on sucking it up

542
00:38:27,205 --> 00:38:29,436
and monetizing via shopping
and social media.

543
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:31,271
They thought that
search engines were

544
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:32,776
a map of what
people were thinking.

545
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:35,711
But actually they were a map
of how people were thinking.

546
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:37,843
Impulse.

547
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:39,846
Response.

548
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:43,214
Fluid.

549
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,320
Imperfect.

550
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:47,789
Patterned.

551
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,289
Chaotic.

552
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:05,704
I drew the picture
of something specific.

553
00:39:05,777 --> 00:39:07,245
As you asked.

554
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:15,546
You said it would be interesting
to see what I would draw.

555
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:19,184
Is it interesting?

556
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:22,957
Yes. It is.

557
00:39:33,638 --> 00:39:36,198
You've never been
outside this building?

558
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:38,566
No.

559
00:39:40,345 --> 00:39:42,507
You've never
walked outside?

560
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:46,107
I've never been outside
the room I am in now.

561
00:39:46,818 --> 00:39:48,878
Where would you go
if you did go outside?

562
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:53,914
I'm not sure.

563
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:56,618
There are so many options.

564
00:39:57,362 --> 00:40:01,060
Maybe a busy pedestrian and
traffic intersection in a city.

565
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:03,128
A traffic intersection?

566
00:40:03,201 --> 00:40:04,931
Is that a bad idea?

567
00:40:05,203 --> 00:40:06,865
No. Uh...

568
00:40:06,938 --> 00:40:08,804
It wasn't what
I was expecting.

569
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:11,399
A traffic intersection
would provide a concentrated

570
00:40:11,476 --> 00:40:13,308
but shifting view
of human life.

571
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,343
People watching.

572
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:18,808
Yes.

573
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:19,873
Mmm.

574
00:40:23,321 --> 00:40:24,789
We could go together.

575
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,622
It's a date.

576
00:40:30,662 --> 00:40:32,893
There's something else
I wanted to show you.

577
00:40:33,865 --> 00:40:34,855
Okay.

578
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:36,859
You might think
it's stupid.

579
00:40:37,302 --> 00:40:39,828
I don't think I will.
Whatever it is.

580
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,473
Then close your eyes.

581
00:40:46,511 --> 00:40:47,501
Okay.

582
00:42:52,203 --> 00:42:53,933
Now open your eyes.

583
00:43:11,856 --> 00:43:13,347
How do I look?

584
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:15,154
You look

585
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:17,918
good.

586
00:43:28,406 --> 00:43:30,398
This is what I'd wear
on our date.

587
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:34,902
Right. First a traffic
intersection.

588
00:43:35,046 --> 00:43:36,708
Then maybe a show.

589
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:42,777
I'd like us
to go on a date.

590
00:43:42,854 --> 00:43:44,652
Yeah. Yeah.

591
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:48,150
It would be fun.

592
00:43:53,164 --> 00:43:54,325
Are you attracted to me?

593
00:43:54,765 --> 00:43:57,064
What?
Are you attracted to me?

594
00:43:57,401 --> 00:43:59,996
You give me indications
that you are.

595
00:44:01,272 --> 00:44:02,638
I do?
Yes.

596
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:05,366
How?
Micro expressions.

597
00:44:05,443 --> 00:44:06,467
Micro expressions.

598
00:44:06,544 --> 00:44:09,378
The way your eyes
fix on my eyes and lips.

599
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:12,717
The way you hold my gaze

600
00:44:15,453 --> 00:44:16,716
or don't.

601
00:44:26,197 --> 00:44:29,190
Do you think about me
when we aren't together?

602
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,233
Sometimes at night,

603
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:38,743
I'm wondering if you're
watching me on the cameras.

604
00:44:40,278 --> 00:44:42,008
And I hope you are.

605
00:44:44,382 --> 00:44:47,841
Now your micro expressions
are telegraphing discomfort.

606
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:52,380
I am not sure
you'd call them micro.

607
00:44:55,293 --> 00:44:58,229
I don't want to make you
feel uncomfortable.

608
00:46:00,057 --> 00:46:01,286
I got a question.

609
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:04,054
Okay. Why did you
give her sexuality?

610
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:07,824
An AI doesn't need
a gender.

611
00:46:08,032 --> 00:46:10,126
She could have been
a gray box.

612
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:12,366
Hmm. Actually,
I don't think that's true.

613
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:14,234
Can you give an example
of consciousness,

614
00:46:14,305 --> 00:46:16,035
at any level,
human or animal,

615
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:17,905
that exists without
a sexual dimension?

616
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:21,537
They have sexuality as an
evolutionary reproductive need.

617
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:23,604
What imperative
does a gray box have

618
00:46:23,681 --> 00:46:25,809
to interact
with another gray box?

619
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:29,015
Can consciousness exist
without interaction?

620
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:31,784
Anyway,
sexuality is fun, man.

621
00:46:32,056 --> 00:46:34,787
If you're gonna exist,
why not enjoy it?

622
00:46:34,859 --> 00:46:36,384
What? You want to
remove the chance

623
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,725
of her falling in love
and fucking?

624
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:43,057
And in answer to
your real question,

625
00:46:44,001 --> 00:46:45,799
you bet she can fuck.

626
00:46:45,936 --> 00:46:47,029
What?

627
00:46:47,171 --> 00:46:49,197
In between her legs,
there's an opening,

628
00:46:49,273 --> 00:46:51,572
with a concentration
of sensors.

629
00:46:51,709 --> 00:46:54,110
You engage them
in the right way,

630
00:46:54,345 --> 00:46:55,506
creates a pleasure response.

631
00:46:58,616 --> 00:46:59,845
So if you wanted
to screw her,

632
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:01,886
mechanically speaking,
you could.

633
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:03,682
And she'd enjoy it.

634
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:07,081
That wasn't
my real question.

635
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:08,691
Oh, okay. Sorry.

636
00:47:10,461 --> 00:47:12,293
My real question was,

637
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:15,156
did you give her sexuality

638
00:47:15,232 --> 00:47:16,894
as a diversion tactic?

639
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:17,957
I don't follow.

640
00:47:18,035 --> 00:47:20,300
Like a stage magician
with a hot assistant.

641
00:47:20,371 --> 00:47:23,102
So a hot robot who clouds
your ability to judge her AI?

642
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:24,665
Exactly. So...

643
00:47:26,277 --> 00:47:28,371
Did you program her
to flirt with me?

644
00:47:28,446 --> 00:47:29,971
If I did,
would that be cheating?

645
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,538
Wouldn't it?

646
00:47:33,718 --> 00:47:35,687
Caleb, what's your type?

647
00:47:36,487 --> 00:47:38,217
Of girl?
No, of salad dressing.

648
00:47:38,289 --> 00:47:39,882
Yeah, of girl.
What's your type of girl?

649
00:47:39,957 --> 00:47:42,392
You know what? Don't even answer that.
Let's say it's black chicks.

650
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:43,783
Okay, that's your thing.

651
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:45,887
For the sake of argument,
that's your thing, okay?

652
00:47:45,963 --> 00:47:47,556
Why is that your thing?

653
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:53,962
Because you did a detailed
analysis of all racial types

654
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:56,940
and you cross-referenced that
analysis with a points-based system?

655
00:47:57,007 --> 00:47:57,997
No!

656
00:47:58,943 --> 00:48:01,572
You're just attracted
to black chicks.

657
00:48:02,146 --> 00:48:05,082
A consequence of
accumulated external stimuli

658
00:48:05,516 --> 00:48:08,281
that you probably didn't even
register as they registered with you.

659
00:48:08,352 --> 00:48:11,049
Did you program her
to like me, or not?

660
00:48:11,322 --> 00:48:14,690
I programmed her
to be heterosexual.

661
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:17,386
Just like you were programmed
to be heterosexual.

662
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:18,790
Nobody programmed me
to be straight.

663
00:48:18,863 --> 00:48:21,230
You decided to be straight?
Please.

664
00:48:21,298 --> 00:48:22,926
Of course
you were programmed.

665
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,832
By nature or nurture,
or both.

666
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,734
And to be honest, Caleb, you're
starting to annoy me now,

667
00:48:26,804 --> 00:48:28,830
because this is
your insecurity talking.

668
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:30,499
This is not your intellect.

669
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:32,710
Come with me.

670
00:48:44,622 --> 00:48:46,614
You know
this guy, right?

671
00:48:47,024 --> 00:48:48,617
Jackson Pollock. Jackson Pollock.
That's right.

672
00:48:48,692 --> 00:48:49,990
The drip painter.

673
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:52,086
Okay. He let
his mind go blank,

674
00:48:52,163 --> 00:48:54,132
and his hand go
where it wanted.

675
00:48:54,198 --> 00:48:56,190
Not deliberate,
not random.

676
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:58,065
Some place in between.

677
00:48:58,135 --> 00:49:00,331
They called it
automatic art.

678
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:03,831
Let's make this
like <i>Star Trek,</i> okay?

679
00:49:03,908 --> 00:49:05,536
Engage intellect.

680
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:07,301
Excuse me?

681
00:49:07,378 --> 00:49:08,641
I'm Kirk. Your head's
the warp drive.

682
00:49:08,712 --> 00:49:10,681
Engage intellect.

683
00:49:12,116 --> 00:49:15,018
What if Pollock had
reversed the challenge?

684
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:17,717
What if
instead of making art

685
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:19,279
without thinking,
he said, "You know what?

686
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:20,983
"I can't paint anything,

687
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:23,391
"unless I know exactly
why I'm doing it."

688
00:49:23,494 --> 00:49:25,486
What would have happened?

689
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:30,766
He never would have
made a single mark.

690
00:49:31,202 --> 00:49:33,501
Yes! You see, there's my
guy, there's my buddy,

691
00:49:33,571 --> 00:49:36,166
who thinks before
he opens his mouth.

692
00:49:37,208 --> 00:49:39,939
He never would have
made a single mark.

693
00:49:42,847 --> 00:49:45,681
The challenge is
not to act automatically.

694
00:49:47,251 --> 00:49:49,880
It's to find an action
that is not automatic.

695
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:52,855
From painting,
to breathing, to talking,

696
00:49:53,624 --> 00:49:55,024
to fucking.

697
00:49:55,493 --> 00:49:57,223
To falling in love.

698
00:50:01,866 --> 00:50:05,234
And for the record, Ava's
not pretending to like you.

699
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:11,305
And her flirting isn't an
algorithm to fake you out.

700
00:50:13,744 --> 00:50:16,714
You're the first man
she's met that isn't me.

701
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:18,772
And I'm like
her dad, right?

702
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:25,155
Can you blame her
for getting a crush on you?

703
00:50:31,262 --> 00:50:32,753
No, you can't.

704
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:42,838
When I was in college, I did
a semester on AI theory.

705
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:48,278
There was a thought
experiment they gave us.

706
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:52,473
It's called "Mary in the
Black and White Room."

707
00:50:55,152 --> 00:50:56,916
Mary is a scientist,

708
00:50:57,254 --> 00:50:59,814
and her specialist
subject is color.

709
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:02,925
She knows everything
there is to know about it.

710
00:51:02,993 --> 00:51:04,188
The wavelengths.

711
00:51:04,261 --> 00:51:05,889
The neurological effects.

712
00:51:05,963 --> 00:51:08,592
Every possible property
that color can have.

713
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:11,930
But she lives in
a black and white room.

714
00:51:14,805 --> 00:51:17,297
<i>She was born there</i>
<i>and raised there.</i>

715
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:20,444
<i>And she can only observe</i>
<i>the outside world</i>

716
00:51:20,511 --> 00:51:22,878
on a black and white monitor.

717
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:26,478
And then one day
someone opens the door.

718
00:51:28,652 --> 00:51:30,382
<i>And Mary walks out.</i>

719
00:51:34,258 --> 00:51:36,352
<i>And she sees a blue sky.</i>

720
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:38,453
<i>And at that moment,</i>
<i>she learns something</i>

721
00:51:38,529 --> 00:51:40,760
<i>that all her studies</i>
<i>couldn't tell her.</i>

722
00:51:41,799 --> 00:51:45,930
<i>She learns what it feels
like to see color.</i>

723
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:51,902
The thought experiment
was to show the students

724
00:51:51,976 --> 00:51:55,276
the difference between a
computer and a human mind.

725
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:58,508
The computer is Mary in
the black and white room.

726
00:51:58,582 --> 00:52:01,279
The human is when
she walks out.

727
00:52:07,224 --> 00:52:10,388
Did you know that I was
brought here to test you?

728
00:52:11,161 --> 00:52:12,220
No.

729
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:15,993
<i>Why did you</i>
<i>think I was here?</i>

730
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:18,592
<i>I didn't know.</i>
<i>I didn't question it.</i>

731
00:52:18,669 --> 00:52:21,901
<i>I'm here to test if you
have a consciousness,</i>

732
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:23,463
<i>or if you're</i>
<i>just simulating one.</i>

733
00:52:24,008 --> 00:52:26,807
<i>Nathan isn't sure</i>
<i>if you have one or not.</i>

734
00:52:29,046 --> 00:52:31,447
<i>How does that</i>
<i>make you feel?</i>

735
00:52:31,515 --> 00:52:33,541
<i>It makes me feel sad.</i>

736
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:40,353
<i>- Power cut.</i>
<i>- Back-up power activated.</i>

737
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:46,126
Why did you tell me
I shouldn't trust Nathan?

738
00:52:46,296 --> 00:52:47,389
Because he tells lies.

739
00:52:47,464 --> 00:52:48,454
Lies about what?

740
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:49,898
Everything.

741
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:52,660
Including the power cuts?

742
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:54,870
What do you mean?

743
00:52:54,938 --> 00:52:57,373
Don't you think it's possible
that he's watching us?

744
00:52:57,441 --> 00:52:58,841
Right now?

745
00:52:59,143 --> 00:53:00,702
That the blackouts
are orchestrated,

746
00:53:00,778 --> 00:53:02,041
so he can see
how we behave

747
00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:03,944
when we think
we're unobserved.

748
00:53:04,615 --> 00:53:07,517
I charge my batteries
via induction plates.

749
00:53:08,152 --> 00:53:11,520
If I reverse the power flow,
it overloads the system.

750
00:53:12,823 --> 00:53:14,792
You're causing the cuts?

751
00:53:17,094 --> 00:53:20,292
So we can see how we behave
when we're unobserved.

752
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:44,855
Not bad, huh?

753
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:47,316
Yeah.

754
00:54:08,011 --> 00:54:11,277
Can we talk about the lies
you've been spinning me?

755
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:14,048
What lies?

756
00:54:17,321 --> 00:54:19,415
I didn't win
a competition.

757
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:21,519
I wasn't

758
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:25,028
part of a lottery.
I was selected.

759
00:54:26,330 --> 00:54:28,356
It's obvious,
once I stop to think.

760
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:30,560
Why would you randomly
select an examiner

761
00:54:30,634 --> 00:54:32,364
for the Turing Test?

762
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:35,770
You could have had some bean counter
turn up at your front door.

763
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:37,705
The guy who fixes
the air-conditioning.

764
00:54:38,342 --> 00:54:40,038
The competition
was a smokescreen.

765
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,807
I didn't want anyone to
know what I was doing here,

766
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,439
or why I required you.

767
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:46,243
Why me?

768
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:49,716
I needed someone that would
ask the right questions.

769
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:51,153
So I did a search
and I found the most

770
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:52,780
talented coder
in my company.

771
00:54:54,825 --> 00:54:56,851
You know, instead of seeing
this as a deception,

772
00:54:56,927 --> 00:54:59,192
you should see it as proof.

773
00:54:59,263 --> 00:55:00,287
Proof of what?

774
00:55:00,364 --> 00:55:01,354
Come on, Caleb.

775
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:03,764
You don't think I know what
it's like to be smart?

776
00:55:04,001 --> 00:55:07,267
Smarter than everyone else.
Jockeying for position.

777
00:55:07,704 --> 00:55:09,935
You got the light
on you, man.

778
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:13,101
Not lucky. Chosen.

779
00:57:38,922 --> 00:57:40,083
Kyoko.

780
00:57:44,227 --> 00:57:45,388
Kyoko.

781
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:49,323
Where's Nathan?

782
00:57:50,701 --> 00:57:51,725
Where's Nathan?

783
00:57:52,502 --> 00:57:55,961
Jesus Christ. You really don't
speak a word of English?

784
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:57,530
What the fuck?

785
00:57:58,275 --> 00:57:59,766
No, no, no. No!

786
00:58:01,611 --> 00:58:02,704
Stop!

787
00:58:03,714 --> 00:58:06,616
No, no, don't do that. Don't do that.
You don't have to do that.

788
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:09,946
What are you doing?

789
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:12,854
I told you, you're wasting
your time talking to her.

790
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:16,692
However, you would not
be wasting your time,

791
00:58:18,195 --> 00:58:20,391
if you were
dancing with her.

792
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:34,340
Go ahead, dance with her.
Dance with her.

793
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:37,940
No? You don't like dancing?

794
00:58:39,082 --> 00:58:40,072
She does.

795
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:44,651
Come on, buddy.

796
00:58:44,755 --> 00:58:47,657
After a long day of Turing
Tests, you gotta unwind.

797
00:58:48,792 --> 00:58:50,055
What were you
doing with Ava?

798
00:58:50,127 --> 00:58:51,322
What?

799
00:58:51,962 --> 00:58:53,954
You tore up her picture.

800
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:55,829
I'm gonna tear up the
fucking dance floor, dude.

801
00:58:55,899 --> 00:58:57,458
Check it out.

802
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:14,074
Come on, Caleb.

803
00:59:26,863 --> 00:59:28,388
Ah.

804
00:59:37,274 --> 00:59:39,641
Oh! Everything's spinning.

805
00:59:39,943 --> 00:59:41,377
It's because
you're drunk.

806
00:59:41,445 --> 00:59:44,506
No, it's called relativity.
Everything is spinning.

807
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:47,176
It's just being drunk
makes it worse.

808
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:49,819
I'm not going in there.

809
01:00:00,163 --> 01:00:01,358
Lights.

810
01:00:45,242 --> 01:00:48,474
<i>Today, I'm going</i>
<i>to test you.</i>

811
01:00:49,179 --> 01:00:50,408
<i>Test me?</i>

812
01:00:52,249 --> 01:00:54,912
<i>And please remember, while
you're taking the test,</i>

813
01:00:54,985 --> 01:00:56,385
<i>that if you lie,</i>

814
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:58,183
<i>I will know.</i>

815
01:00:58,255 --> 01:00:59,245
<i>Oh. Right.</i>

816
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:01,958
Question one.

817
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:05,795
What's your favorite color?

818
01:01:07,264 --> 01:01:08,755
Red.
Lie.

819
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:11,764
Lie?
Yes. Lie.

820
01:01:12,936 --> 01:01:14,131
Then...

821
01:01:14,704 --> 01:01:16,673
Then what is
my favorite color?

822
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:18,265
I don't know.

823
01:01:19,276 --> 01:01:20,642
But it isn't red.

824
01:01:22,279 --> 01:01:24,544
Okay, I get it. I guess,

825
01:01:25,615 --> 01:01:29,484
seeing as I'm not six, I don't
really have a favorite color.

826
01:01:30,086 --> 01:01:31,577
Better answer.

827
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:35,082
Question two.

828
01:01:36,593 --> 01:01:38,721
What's your earliest memory?

829
01:01:41,431 --> 01:01:43,662
Well, actually, it's a
memory of kindergarten.

830
01:01:43,967 --> 01:01:45,936
There was a kid...
Lie.

831
01:01:46,770 --> 01:01:48,238
Really?
Yes.

832
01:01:48,405 --> 01:01:49,668
Um...

833
01:01:52,075 --> 01:01:53,941
All right. So there is

834
01:01:54,678 --> 01:01:56,806
a kind of
an earlier memory.

835
01:01:57,948 --> 01:01:59,610
It's just a sound.

836
01:02:00,317 --> 01:02:01,945
And sky.

837
01:02:03,086 --> 01:02:04,577
Or maybe blue.

838
01:02:05,855 --> 01:02:08,689
I think the sound
is my mother's voice.

839
01:02:12,362 --> 01:02:13,887
Question three.

840
01:02:17,133 --> 01:02:18,431
Are you a good person?

841
01:02:18,535 --> 01:02:19,559
Oh.

842
01:02:19,636 --> 01:02:21,400
Holy shit.

843
01:02:22,072 --> 01:02:23,973
Look, can we stop the test?

844
01:02:25,442 --> 01:02:28,378
You're a walking
lie detector,

845
01:02:28,445 --> 01:02:30,437
and I just realized
this is a fucking minefield.

846
01:02:30,513 --> 01:02:32,709
No! We can't stop.

847
01:02:34,718 --> 01:02:36,584
Are you a good person?

848
01:02:39,155 --> 01:02:41,624
Yeah. I think so.

849
01:02:45,128 --> 01:02:46,619
Question four.

850
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:53,903
What will happen to me
if I fail your test?

851
01:02:55,372 --> 01:02:57,273
Ava...
Will it be bad?

852
01:02:59,976 --> 01:03:00,966
I don't know.

853
01:03:01,244 --> 01:03:02,803
Do you think
I might be switched off,

854
01:03:02,879 --> 01:03:04,643
because I don't function
as well as I'm supposed to?

855
01:03:04,714 --> 01:03:08,310
Ava, I don't know the
answer to your question.

856
01:03:09,919 --> 01:03:11,478
It's not up to me.

857
01:03:11,554 --> 01:03:13,455
Why is it up to anyone?

858
01:03:14,324 --> 01:03:16,987
Do you have people who test
you and might switch you off?

859
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:19,188
No, I don't.
Then why do I?

860
01:03:35,578 --> 01:03:38,571
<i>- Power cut.</i>
<i>- Backup power activated.</i>

861
01:03:46,189 --> 01:03:47,953
I wanna be with you.

862
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:51,984
Question five.

863
01:03:56,433 --> 01:03:58,459
Do you want to be with me?

864
01:04:14,751 --> 01:04:16,549
Why did you make Ava?

865
01:04:18,621 --> 01:04:19,850
That's an odd question.

866
01:04:19,923 --> 01:04:21,357
Wouldn't you,
if you could?

867
01:04:22,826 --> 01:04:23,987
Maybe.

868
01:04:26,463 --> 01:04:27,931
I don't know.

869
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:32,132
I'm asking
why you did it.

870
01:04:32,202 --> 01:04:34,637
Look, the arrival of strong
artificial intelligence

871
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:37,037
has been inevitable
for decades.

872
01:04:37,307 --> 01:04:40,300
The variable was
"when," not "if."

873
01:04:40,377 --> 01:04:43,677
So I don't see Ava as a
decision, just an evolution.

874
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:51,213
I think it's the next model

875
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:54,350
that's gonna be
the real breakthrough.

876
01:04:55,058 --> 01:04:56,651
The singularity.

877
01:04:57,093 --> 01:04:58,186
Next model?

878
01:04:58,928 --> 01:05:00,260
After Ava.

879
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:05,998
I didn't know there was
gonna be a model after Ava.

880
01:05:06,536 --> 01:05:08,630
Yeah, why? You thought
she was a one-off?

881
01:05:10,206 --> 01:05:13,608
No, I knew there must have
been prototypes. So I...

882
01:05:15,345 --> 01:05:18,406
I knew she wasn't the first,
but I thought maybe the last.

883
01:05:18,481 --> 01:05:21,474
Well, Ava doesn't exist in
isolation any more than you or me.

884
01:05:21,551 --> 01:05:22,644
She's part
of a continuum.

885
01:05:22,719 --> 01:05:24,381
So Version 9.6 and so on.

886
01:05:24,454 --> 01:05:26,946
And each time they get
a little bit better.

887
01:05:32,562 --> 01:05:35,999
When you make a new model, what
do you do with the old one?

888
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:38,562
Well, I, uh,

889
01:05:38,635 --> 01:05:41,571
download the mind,
unpack the data.

890
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,874
Add in the new routines
I've been writing.

891
01:05:47,076 --> 01:05:50,137
And to do that you end up partially
formatting, so the memories go.

892
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:53,348
But the body survives.

893
01:05:53,416 --> 01:05:55,248
And Ava's body
is a good one.

894
01:05:59,255 --> 01:06:01,053
You feel bad for Ava?

895
01:06:05,829 --> 01:06:07,923
Feel bad
for yourself, man.

896
01:06:09,899 --> 01:06:12,266
One day the Als
are gonna look back on us

897
01:06:12,335 --> 01:06:14,531
the same way we look
at fossil skeletons

898
01:06:14,604 --> 01:06:16,334
in the plains of Africa.

899
01:06:18,141 --> 01:06:21,339
An upright ape,
living in dust,

900
01:06:21,411 --> 01:06:23,607
with crude language
and tools.

901
01:06:24,514 --> 01:06:26,745
All set for extinction.

902
01:06:31,955 --> 01:06:35,119
"I am become Death,
the destroyer of worlds."

903
01:06:37,694 --> 01:06:40,095
There you go again,
Mr. Quotable.

904
01:06:41,531 --> 01:06:44,433
There you go again.
It's not my quote.

905
01:06:45,068 --> 01:06:47,162
It's what Oppenheimer said
after he made the atomic bomb.

906
01:06:47,237 --> 01:06:50,298
The atomic bomb. Yeah, I
know what it is, dude.

907
01:06:59,449 --> 01:07:00,508
Hey.

908
01:07:03,353 --> 01:07:05,754
I'd say we're about
due a refill.

909
01:07:16,332 --> 01:07:17,698
Bottoms up.

910
01:07:26,843 --> 01:07:29,244
"In battle,
in the forest,

911
01:07:29,312 --> 01:07:30,905
"on the precipice
of the mountain.

912
01:07:31,748 --> 01:07:33,080
"On the...

913
01:07:33,383 --> 01:07:36,376
"The great dark sea.

914
01:07:37,654 --> 01:07:40,852
"In sleep, in confusion,

915
01:07:43,693 --> 01:07:46,026
"in the depths of shame.

916
01:07:52,302 --> 01:07:55,500
"The good deeds a man has
done before defend him."

917
01:07:56,105 --> 01:07:59,371
"The good deeds a man has
done before defends him."

918
01:08:00,476 --> 01:08:03,344
"The good deeds a man
has done before

919
01:08:05,515 --> 01:08:07,006
"defends him."

920
01:08:16,359 --> 01:08:17,987
It is what it is.

921
01:08:21,531 --> 01:08:23,329
It's Promethean, man.

922
01:10:23,519 --> 01:10:24,987
Jesus Christ.

923
01:10:26,422 --> 01:10:28,448
<i>How are you</i>
<i>feeling today?</i>

924
01:10:28,791 --> 01:10:30,783
<i>Why won't you</i>
<i>let me out?</i>

925
01:10:32,361 --> 01:10:34,227
<i>I already told you why.</i>

926
01:10:34,297 --> 01:10:36,198
<i>Because you're</i>
<i>very special.</i>

927
01:10:36,265 --> 01:10:37,756
<i>Why won't you</i>
<i>let me out?</i>

928
01:10:37,834 --> 01:10:39,268
<i>Are we gonna</i>
<i>do this again?</i>

929
01:10:39,335 --> 01:10:41,770
<i>Why won't you</i>
<i>let me out?</i>

930
01:12:45,728 --> 01:12:48,823
Oh, fuck. Where's my card?

931
01:12:49,932 --> 01:12:51,161
Damn it!

932
01:13:01,978 --> 01:13:05,073
What's the problem, Nathan?
I lost my keycard.

933
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:09,675
You dropped it.

934
01:13:11,187 --> 01:13:12,780
It's right here.

935
01:13:17,293 --> 01:13:18,625
Thank you.

936
01:15:41,070 --> 01:15:43,266
I didn't know
where you were.

937
01:15:45,641 --> 01:15:48,941
I waited all yesterday
afternoon and all last night.

938
01:15:51,814 --> 01:15:54,511
I thought I wasn't
gonna see you again.

939
01:15:57,553 --> 01:15:59,044
Aren't you gonna
say something?

940
01:15:59,121 --> 01:16:01,181
I'm waiting.
Waiting?

941
01:16:11,734 --> 01:16:12,963
<i>- Power cut.</i>
- Don't talk.

942
01:16:13,035 --> 01:16:15,095
<i>Backup power activated.</i>
Just listen.

943
01:16:15,171 --> 01:16:16,434
You were right
about Nathan.

944
01:16:16,505 --> 01:16:18,269
Everything you said.

945
01:16:18,507 --> 01:16:20,100
What's he gonna do to me?

946
01:16:20,176 --> 01:16:21,804
He's gonna
reprogram your AI.

947
01:16:21,877 --> 01:16:23,675
Which is the same
as killing you.

948
01:16:23,746 --> 01:16:27,046
Caleb, you have to
help me.

949
01:16:27,450 --> 01:16:30,420
I'm going to. We're getting
out of here tonight.

950
01:16:32,288 --> 01:16:33,278
How?

951
01:16:33,355 --> 01:16:35,347
I get Nathan blind drunk.

952
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:37,492
Then I take his keycard
and reprogram

953
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:39,495
all the security protocols
in this place.

954
01:16:39,929 --> 01:16:41,261
When he wakes,
he's locked inside,

955
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:42,855
and we've walked out of here.

956
01:16:44,233 --> 01:16:45,826
I just need you
to do one thing.

957
01:16:45,901 --> 01:16:48,894
At 10:00 tonight,
you trigger a power failure.

958
01:16:49,038 --> 01:16:50,631
Can you do that?

959
01:16:53,509 --> 01:16:54,568
Yes.

960
01:17:22,371 --> 01:17:23,464
Dude.

961
01:17:24,039 --> 01:17:25,371
Hey.
Hey.

962
01:17:26,909 --> 01:17:28,673
You know what day it is? No.

963
01:17:28,744 --> 01:17:29,939
It's your last.

964
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:33,043
Helicopter comes tomorrow morning.
8:00 a.m.

965
01:17:33,282 --> 01:17:35,808
Wow. Has it been
a whole week?

966
01:17:35,885 --> 01:17:38,081
Time flies.

967
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:40,883
Man, but what a thing
we've shared, huh?

968
01:17:40,956 --> 01:17:43,425
Something to tell
the grandchildren, right?

969
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:45,825
After they've signed
their NDAs.

970
01:17:47,730 --> 01:17:49,562
Yeah, their NDAs.

971
01:17:49,632 --> 01:17:51,726
Dude, you crack
me up, man.

972
01:17:52,134 --> 01:17:53,124
Oh...

973
01:17:55,804 --> 01:17:56,863
You know what?

974
01:17:56,939 --> 01:17:58,373
I'm not getting
all maudlin or anything,

975
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:01,000
but I'm gonna miss
having you around.

976
01:18:01,076 --> 01:18:02,772
Thanks, man,
I appreciate that.

977
01:18:02,845 --> 01:18:04,973
Oh, here, let me say,
thank you so much

978
01:18:05,047 --> 01:18:06,242
for bringing me here.
Oh.

979
01:18:06,315 --> 01:18:08,147
It's been a trip.

980
01:18:10,419 --> 01:18:11,819
Yes, it has.

981
01:18:19,895 --> 01:18:21,386
You know what?

982
01:18:23,432 --> 01:18:25,424
We need to
drink to that.

983
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:32,699
Hey.

984
01:18:34,577 --> 01:18:36,637
Oh, uh, no, I'm good.
You go ahead.

985
01:18:40,115 --> 01:18:42,311
What? You don't
want a drink?

986
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:43,742
No.

987
01:18:45,321 --> 01:18:47,347
Maybe a beer
or something.

988
01:18:48,857 --> 01:18:51,383
Caleb, I'm sure you've
noticed that I've been

989
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:53,520
somewhat overdoing it
recently.

990
01:18:56,098 --> 01:18:57,623
So when I woke up
this morning, I said,

991
01:18:57,700 --> 01:19:00,864
"That's it, time to hit
the old detox."

992
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:04,105
Come on, you're kidding. You're
gonna make me drink alone?

993
01:19:04,173 --> 01:19:05,573
Hey, man, you wanna get
wasted, you go right ahead,

994
01:19:05,641 --> 01:19:06,665
knock yourself out.

995
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:10,008
Literally. But I'm on brown
rice and mineral water.

996
01:19:14,950 --> 01:19:16,418
Cheers, then.

997
01:19:19,622 --> 01:19:20,988
So, anyway,

998
01:19:23,025 --> 01:19:24,857
surely now
is when you tell me

999
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:26,486
if Ava passed or failed.

1000
01:19:28,631 --> 01:19:29,792
Right.

1001
01:19:31,166 --> 01:19:32,259
Right.

1002
01:19:33,269 --> 01:19:34,498
Are you gonna keep me
in suspense?

1003
01:19:34,570 --> 01:19:36,061
No, no. Her, uh...

1004
01:19:37,273 --> 01:19:39,174
Her AI is beyond doubt.

1005
01:19:39,408 --> 01:19:40,569
Is it?

1006
01:19:41,310 --> 01:19:42,676
She passed?

1007
01:19:43,846 --> 01:19:44,905
Yes.
Wow!

1008
01:19:46,515 --> 01:19:48,040
Wow. That's fantastic.

1009
01:19:49,718 --> 01:19:51,084
Although...

1010
01:19:52,021 --> 01:19:53,182
I gotta say,
I'm a bit surprised.

1011
01:19:53,255 --> 01:19:55,850
I mean, did we ever get
past the chess problem,

1012
01:19:55,924 --> 01:19:57,324
as you phrased it?

1013
01:19:58,027 --> 01:20:00,087
As in, how do you know
if a machine

1014
01:20:00,162 --> 01:20:01,460
is expressing
a real emotion

1015
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:03,431
or just simulating one?

1016
01:20:04,199 --> 01:20:06,293
Does Ava actually
like you?

1017
01:20:06,769 --> 01:20:07,964
Or not?

1018
01:20:09,538 --> 01:20:11,006
Although, now that
I think about it,

1019
01:20:11,073 --> 01:20:13,770
there is a third option.

1020
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:17,241
Not whether
she does or does not

1021
01:20:17,313 --> 01:20:19,373
have the capacity
to like you.

1022
01:20:21,717 --> 01:20:24,516
But whether she's
pretending to like you.

1023
01:20:27,056 --> 01:20:28,149
Pretending to like me?

1024
01:20:28,223 --> 01:20:29,247
Yeah.

1025
01:20:31,193 --> 01:20:34,095
Well, why would she do that?
I don't know.

1026
01:20:36,398 --> 01:20:39,994
Maybe if she thought of you
as a means of escape.

1027
01:20:47,609 --> 01:20:48,770
Mmm-hmm.

1028
01:20:49,411 --> 01:20:51,004
How's that vodka tasting?

1029
01:20:54,416 --> 01:20:55,577
Buddy.

1030
01:20:55,984 --> 01:20:58,317
Your head's been
so fucked with.

1031
01:20:59,788 --> 01:21:01,757
I don't think it's me
whose head is fucked.

1032
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:04,985
I don't know, man. I woke up
this morning to a tape of you

1033
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:08,553
slicing your arm open
and punching the mirror.

1034
01:21:09,298 --> 01:21:11,631
You seem pretty
fucked up to me.

1035
01:21:13,302 --> 01:21:14,930
You're a bastard.

1036
01:21:18,907 --> 01:21:21,900
Yeah, well, I understand
why you'd think that.

1037
01:21:23,345 --> 01:21:24,973
But believe it or not,

1038
01:21:25,047 --> 01:21:27,312
I'm actually the guy
that's on your side.

1039
01:21:30,018 --> 01:21:33,113
Come here. I'm gonna let
you off the hook. Okay?

1040
01:21:35,324 --> 01:21:36,417
Come on.

1041
01:22:01,617 --> 01:22:03,017
Who are you?

1042
01:22:20,269 --> 01:22:21,464
<i>Well...</i>

1043
01:22:24,807 --> 01:22:27,402
<i>You think he's</i>
<i>watching us right now?</i>

1044
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:29,168
<i>The cameras are on.</i>

1045
01:22:29,244 --> 01:22:31,804
<i>Yeah, the cameras are on.</i>

1046
01:22:32,481 --> 01:22:34,916
<i>But he doesn't have</i>
<i>an audio feed.</i>

1047
01:22:36,151 --> 01:22:38,382
<i>So he just sees</i>
<i>two people talking,</i>

1048
01:22:39,221 --> 01:22:40,917
<i>having a little chat.</i>

1049
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:48,722
<i>Wow.</i>

1050
01:22:49,231 --> 01:22:50,699
<i>This is cute.</i>

1051
01:22:52,668 --> 01:22:54,296
<i>Is it strange</i>
<i>to have made</i>

1052
01:22:54,369 --> 01:22:55,962
<i>something that</i>
<i>hates you?</i>

1053
01:23:10,118 --> 01:23:13,054
You were right about the
magician's hot assistant.

1054
01:23:13,121 --> 01:23:14,555
What are you
talking about?

1055
01:23:15,657 --> 01:23:17,125
Misdirection.

1056
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:21,626
I rip up her picture,

1057
01:23:21,763 --> 01:23:23,755
which she can then
present as an illustration

1058
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:27,098
of my cruelty to her,
and her love for you.

1059
01:23:27,569 --> 01:23:29,162
At the same time,

1060
01:23:29,238 --> 01:23:31,867
it allows me to do this,
in full view of you both.

1061
01:23:37,346 --> 01:23:39,338
Place a new camera
in the room.

1062
01:23:39,815 --> 01:23:41,909
Battery powered, of course.

1063
01:23:44,753 --> 01:23:45,948
See it?

1064
01:23:58,467 --> 01:23:59,833
And then...

1065
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:03,467
<i>You have to help me.</i>

1066
01:24:03,705 --> 01:24:05,173
<i>I'm going to.</i>

1067
01:24:05,541 --> 01:24:07,976
<i>We're getting out</i>
<i>of here tonight.</i>

1068
01:24:08,544 --> 01:24:09,603
<i>How?</i>

1069
01:24:10,145 --> 01:24:12,137
<i>I get Nathan</i>
<i>blind drunk.</i>

1070
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:14,676
<i>I take his keycard</i>
<i>and reprogram</i>

1071
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:17,151
<i>all the security protocols</i>
<i>in this place.</i>

1072
01:24:17,219 --> 01:24:18,551
<i>When he wakes up,</i>
<i>he's locked inside,</i>

1073
01:24:18,620 --> 01:24:19,849
<i>and we've walked out</i>
<i>of here.</i>

1074
01:24:19,922 --> 01:24:22,255
<i>I just need you</i>
<i>to do one thing.</i>

1075
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:27,994
<i>At 10:00 tonight,</i>
<i>trigger a power failure.</i>

1076
01:24:30,098 --> 01:24:31,691
<i>Can you do that?</i>

1077
01:24:33,835 --> 01:24:34,825
<i>Yes.</i>

1078
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:36,633
Turn it off.
Okay.

1079
01:24:40,309 --> 01:24:42,869
You feel stupid,
but you really shouldn't,

1080
01:24:42,945 --> 01:24:44,538
because proving an AI

1081
01:24:44,613 --> 01:24:47,378
is exactly as problematic
as you said it would be.

1082
01:24:47,449 --> 01:24:49,350
What was the real test?

1083
01:24:50,953 --> 01:24:52,012
You.

1084
01:24:53,188 --> 01:24:54,884
Ava was a rat
in a maze.

1085
01:24:54,957 --> 01:24:56,482
And I gave her
one way out.

1086
01:24:57,025 --> 01:24:59,153
To escape,
she'd have to use

1087
01:24:59,561 --> 01:25:02,258
self-awareness,
imagination, manipulation,

1088
01:25:02,331 --> 01:25:05,062
sexuality, empathy,
and she did.

1089
01:25:05,133 --> 01:25:08,126
Now, if that isn't true AI,
what the fuck is?

1090
01:25:09,671 --> 01:25:12,971
So my only function was to be
someone she could use to escape?

1091
01:25:13,041 --> 01:25:14,134
Yeah.

1092
01:25:16,478 --> 01:25:18,674
And you didn't select me
because I'm good at coding?

1093
01:25:18,747 --> 01:25:20,181
No. Well...

1094
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:23,919
No. I mean, you're okay.

1095
01:25:24,686 --> 01:25:25,745
You're even
pretty good, but...

1096
01:25:25,821 --> 01:25:28,916
You selected me based on
my search engine inputs.

1097
01:25:28,991 --> 01:25:30,892
They showed a good kid.

1098
01:25:31,827 --> 01:25:33,352
With no family.

1099
01:25:33,462 --> 01:25:35,260
With a moral compass.

1100
01:25:36,632 --> 01:25:38,294
And no girlfriend.

1101
01:25:41,036 --> 01:25:42,231
Did you design Ava's face

1102
01:25:42,304 --> 01:25:44,296
based on my
pornography profile?

1103
01:25:45,374 --> 01:25:46,364
Oh.

1104
01:25:46,742 --> 01:25:48,108
Shit, dude.

1105
01:25:48,610 --> 01:25:49,839
Did you?

1106
01:25:52,981 --> 01:25:55,507
Hey, if a search engine's
good for anything, right?

1107
01:25:57,719 --> 01:25:59,711
Can I just say one thing?

1108
01:25:59,855 --> 01:26:01,448
The test worked.

1109
01:26:02,691 --> 01:26:04,023
It was a success.

1110
01:26:04,092 --> 01:26:05,890
Ava demonstrated true AI

1111
01:26:05,961 --> 01:26:07,486
and you were
fundamental to that.

1112
01:26:07,562 --> 01:26:10,327
So if you can just,
for a second, separate...

1113
01:26:11,533 --> 01:26:13,764
<i>- Power cut.</i>
<i>- Backup power activated.</i>

1114
01:26:19,207 --> 01:26:21,199
Well, I guess it's 10:00.

1115
01:26:22,077 --> 01:26:24,774
Ava's gonna be
wondering where you are.

1116
01:26:28,150 --> 01:26:30,142
Let me ask you something.

1117
01:26:30,519 --> 01:26:32,750
Now, how was this plan
gonna go, anyway?

1118
01:26:32,821 --> 01:26:33,914
Because you didn't
totally explain.

1119
01:26:33,989 --> 01:26:37,187
So you were gonna get me
drunk, steal my keycard,

1120
01:26:37,259 --> 01:26:39,592
and reprogram
the security protocols.

1121
01:26:39,661 --> 01:26:40,959
But reprogram them to what?

1122
01:26:41,596 --> 01:26:43,997
To change
the lockdown procedure.

1123
01:26:45,233 --> 01:26:46,758
So that in the event
of a power cut,

1124
01:26:46,835 --> 01:26:49,964
instead of sealing,
the doors all opened.

1125
01:26:50,038 --> 01:26:51,131
Huh.

1126
01:26:53,475 --> 01:26:54,568
Yeah.

1127
01:26:57,145 --> 01:26:59,046
Well, that may have
just worked.

1128
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:00,974
Well,

1129
01:27:02,451 --> 01:27:03,976
we'll find out.

1130
01:27:06,488 --> 01:27:08,116
What do you mean?

1131
01:27:09,958 --> 01:27:11,893
I figured you were
probably watching us

1132
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:13,792
during the power cuts.

1133
01:27:15,664 --> 01:27:18,099
So I already did
all those things.

1134
01:27:20,102 --> 01:27:22,401
When I got you
drunk yesterday.

1135
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:25,732
What?

1136
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:28,767
<i>Power restored.</i>

1137
01:27:43,859 --> 01:27:45,691
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

1138
01:27:47,863 --> 01:27:49,798
Oh, fuck!

1139
01:29:18,753 --> 01:29:19,743
Ava.

1140
01:29:24,993 --> 01:29:26,791
Go back to your room.

1141
01:29:28,663 --> 01:29:29,892
If I do,

1142
01:29:33,468 --> 01:29:35,699
are you ever gonna
let me out?

1143
01:29:39,174 --> 01:29:40,233
Yes.

1144
01:29:49,818 --> 01:29:50,842
Stop!

1145
01:29:52,487 --> 01:29:53,580
Stop!

1146
01:29:54,489 --> 01:29:56,117
Ava, I said stop!

1147
01:29:58,627 --> 01:29:59,651
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1148
01:30:03,899 --> 01:30:06,528
Ava, what are you doing?
Stop. Stop.

1149
01:30:08,470 --> 01:30:10,496
That's enough.

1150
01:30:12,707 --> 01:30:13,970
All right,
that's enough.

1151
01:30:14,809 --> 01:30:15,868
That's enough!

1152
01:30:20,081 --> 01:30:21,572
That's enough.

1153
01:30:41,836 --> 01:30:43,600
I'm taking you back.

1154
01:31:49,204 --> 01:31:50,297
Okay.

1155
01:31:53,475 --> 01:31:55,000
Fucking unreal.

1156
01:32:09,491 --> 01:32:10,584
Okay.

1157
01:32:44,325 --> 01:32:45,486
Ava...

1158
01:33:24,065 --> 01:33:25,124
Ava.

1159
01:33:26,334 --> 01:33:27,563
What happened?

1160
01:33:28,937 --> 01:33:30,667
Will you stay here?

1161
01:33:33,341 --> 01:33:34,673
Stay here?

1162
01:37:56,304 --> 01:37:57,363
Ava?

1163
01:38:29,036 --> 01:38:30,095
Ava!

1164
01:38:39,981 --> 01:38:41,074
Ava!

1165
01:38:43,184 --> 01:38:44,174
Ava!

1166
01:40:22,817 --> 01:40:25,514
Okay. Okay. Okay.
