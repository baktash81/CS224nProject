I used the lye to bury our dog last year.

Probably. Am I a suspect?

Thought you had him under surveillance.

because you have no idea.

this through too good, huh? I...

1172
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:04,003
I been thinking a lot about
what happened to your nephew.

1173
01:49:05,080 --> 01:49:08,801
And I know I scared him the other day
at the police station, and...

1174
01:49:10,280 --> 01:49:14,126
What I'm trying to say is I kind of feel
responsible for him running away.

1175

1176

Yeah.

1177
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:36,170
My husband and I were
very devout at one time.

1178
01:49:37,480 --> 01:49:42,168
Spent our summers driving around
in that camper with our son...

1179
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:45,327
...handing out pamphlets.

1180
01:49:46,600 --> 01:49:48,921

1181
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:54,888
After our son died of cancer...

1182
01:49:55,160 --> 01:49:57,925
...we started seeing things differently.

1183
01:49:59,160 --> 01:50:01,162
Adopting Alex helped...

1184
01:50:01,960 --> 01:50:04,281
...but we never got over it.

1191
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:32,801
Alex never talks very much...

1192
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:36,043
...so when people come over here,
I hardly know what to say.

1193
01:50:36,200 --> 01:50:37,247
He doesn't talk much?

1194
01:50:37,440 --> 01:50:40,728
Well, he talks. Good morning,
good night, that sort of thing.

1195
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:43,804
Hard to get too much
more than that out of him.

1196
01:50:45,240 --> 01:50:47,402
Had an accident when he was little.

1197
01:50:47,560 --> 01:50:51,531
After that he started choosing his words
a little too carefully.

1198
01:50:51,680 --> 01:50:55,048
- What...? What kind of accident did he...?
- Oh.

1199
01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:58,240
My husband kept snakes.

1200
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:02,803
It wasn't that bad what happened,
but Alex had a fear of them and...

1201
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:05,921
That's not my favorite memory.

1202
01:51:06,760 --> 01:51:09,684
I'm sorry. It's none of my business.

1203
01:51:10,120 --> 01:51:11,610
Oh.

01:51:14,920 --> 01:51:17,048
Can I get you a cup of tea, Mr. Dover?

1205
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:24,161
Oh.

1206
01:51:24,360 --> 01:51:27,762
Oh, I'm so sorry. I thought you
would have known about that already.

1207
01:51:28,840 --> 01:51:31,411
I say it's better this way.
You know, that awful man...

1208
01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:36,646
...he would have spent years on Death Row
just watching TV and getting fat.

1209
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:42,290

we sampled from the plastic containers?

It's supposed to snow soon. Hurry up, okay?

It's like he's play-acting. Case in point:

1228
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,685
Except for the items ID'd
by the Dovers and the Birches...

1229
01:54:22,840 --> 01:54:25,923
...all the kids' clothes that we found
still had tags on them.

1230
01:54:26,080 --> 01:54:28,447
And that maze book that we found,
he made it.

1231
01:54:28,600 --> 01:54:31,285
Photocopies, pictures from this book
we found in the attic.

1232
01:54:31,440 --> 01:54:34,887
- Ex-FBI agent wrote that.
- "Finding the Invisible Man."

1233
01:54:35,040 --> 01:54:39,125
It's about a theoretical suspect he believed
was responsible for a bunch of abductions.

1234
01:54:39,280 --> 01:54:42,966
It's totally discredited,
I guess, but I read some of it.

1235
01:54:43,120 --> 01:54:46,488
Taylor was abducted when he was a kid.
He ran away after three weeks.

1236
01:54:46,640 --> 01:54:49,883
The captor drugged him on some
sort of LSD/Ketamine cocktail.

1237
01:54:50,040 --> 01:54:52,566
He never remembered
and they never caught the guy.

1238
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:57,567
Okay, so, he read the book and decided
he was taken by the Invisible Man.

1239
01:54:57,720 --> 01:55:00,769
Now he's doing his best imitation, right?

1240
01:55:03,080 --> 01:55:06,971
Yeah, he was doing his best imitation.
He killed himself last night.

1241
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:10,127
How did he do that?
I thought he was in custody.

1242
01:55:14,920 --> 01:55:16,331
Hey.

1243
01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:20,641
Taylor drew this. It's a map to the bodies.

1244
01:55:20,800 --> 01:55:22,165
It's a map to the bodies.

1245
01:55:22,320 --> 01:55:25,324
We found the same design
on a pendant we pulled off that corpse.

1246
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:27,682
- There's a connection, okay?
- Connection is...

1247
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:31,367
...that it's the last maze in the book.
It's unsolvable. There's no way out.

1248
01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:35,081
Your corpse is another wannabe,
read the book.

1249
01:55:35,840 --> 01:55:37,604
What are you saying to me, Rich? What?

1250
01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:39,922
What are you saying,
that this guy is a fake?

1251
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:43,084
You're saying that the girls
are still out there somewhere?

1252

1253

How did...? How did the parents...

1254
