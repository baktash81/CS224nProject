1
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,308
Boo-boo.

2
00:03:13,455 --> 00:03:15,822
Couldn't we read another book?

3
00:03:17,903 --> 00:03:20,043
We've read this one a hundred times.

4
00:03:21,104 --> 00:03:23,175
Please?

5
00:03:23,407 --> 00:03:28,196
Nanny Gilbertine is so tired of
the Boo-boo book, she could just gag.

6
00:03:28,302 --> 00:03:30,278
Boo-boo.

7
00:03:32,047 --> 00:03:34,119
All right. All right.

8
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:42,630
''One fine and sunny day,
Baby Boo's nanny Henrietta said

9
00:03:42,735 --> 00:03:48,268
'Baby Boo, today you shall go
on a wonderful adventure.'''

10
00:03:48,336 --> 00:03:51,468
'''You will see the many,
many sights of the Big City.'''

11
00:03:56,399 --> 00:04:00,010
''After a lovely breakfast
they walked down the lane to the corner,

12
00:04:00,078 --> 00:04:02,829
where they boarded a big, blue bus.''

13
00:04:04,047 --> 00:04:06,415
''They were on their way to the Big City.''

14
00:04:06,543 --> 00:04:09,292
''Baby Boo felt very grown-up indeed,

15
00:04:09,391 --> 00:04:12,871
for this was his first trip
away from Mother and Father.''

16
00:04:15,086 --> 00:04:16,680
Did l tell you?

17
00:04:16,751 --> 00:04:21,060
- Baby's having his picture taken today.
- Oh. Say hello to old Willy for me.

18
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:26,468
Old Willy isn't doing it.
l've hired Downtown Baby Photographers.

19
00:04:28,013 --> 00:04:31,079
He's photographed Cotwell babies
since the Depression.

20
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:34,347
Old Willy hasn't had a picture
in the paper in over 20 years.

21
00:04:34,415 --> 00:04:37,382
Everyone we know has had
their baby's picture in the paper.

22
00:04:37,455 --> 00:04:40,684
Baby Bink is almost a year old
and virtually unknown.

23
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:46,445
l can't count the number of times l've been
asked why we're keeping our baby a secret.

24
00:04:48,175 --> 00:04:50,117
You're right.

25
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:55,525
The only way to quiet such talk is to have our
small-minded friends open up their papers

26
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:59,242
and see a photograph of
the prettiest baby in the city.

27
00:05:03,152 --> 00:05:06,947
- Get out! Come on!
- Come on, let's go. l said move it!

28
00:05:07,021 --> 00:05:08,845
Move it!

29
00:05:14,287 --> 00:05:17,733
Off with the fuzzy pink and blue sweaters,
nice and slow.

30
00:05:17,838 --> 00:05:20,872
- Ed, does it matter who wears pink or blue?
- No!

31
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:24,805
Cotwell... Cotwell... Where is that little...

32
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:28,872
Dinner with the Westfalls tonight.

33
00:05:28,973 --> 00:05:32,968
Don't forget to do your breathing exercises
Dr Phillips suggested.

34
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:36,835
- l have a breathing scheduled at 11.
- Bless your soul.

35
00:05:37,774 --> 00:05:39,563
Have a wonderful day.

36
00:05:43,534 --> 00:05:45,706
Bing?

37
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,812
What did you forget?

38
00:05:49,228 --> 00:05:52,045
Oh, my pen! Thank you, Andrews.

39
00:05:52,845 --> 00:05:54,852
What else?

40
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,536
Darling, you know how
l hate games in the morning.

41
00:06:01,455 --> 00:06:04,072
Of course. Goodness, how could l forget?

42
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:06,505
Don't you get...

43
00:06:06,606 --> 00:06:10,598
Don't you get into any mischief
while Dada's gone. Burble, burble.

44
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:14,695
Won't it be exciting when he can understand
the wonderful things we say to him?

45
00:06:14,829 --> 00:06:17,382
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

46
00:06:46,637 --> 00:06:49,540
He can't look too butch,
but he can't look too feminine.

47
00:06:49,613 --> 00:06:52,295
He has to look angelic, like a little prince.

48
00:06:52,398 --> 00:06:55,179
That would suggest blue.

49
00:06:55,277 --> 00:06:59,433
Blue? Won't that look like we're trying to
match his eyes? Won't it be too obvious?

50
00:06:59,534 --> 00:07:02,664
l see lots of babies with
blue eyes and blue outfits.

51
00:07:02,765 --> 00:07:05,635
What kind of babies?
Rich babies? Pretty babies?

52
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:08,808
- Regular babies? lmportant babies?
- Regular babies.

53
00:07:09,292 --> 00:07:11,780
Baby Bink is not a regular baby.

54
00:07:19,245 --> 00:07:21,132
Buff, buff, buff, buff, buff.

55
00:07:21,197 --> 00:07:23,532
Oh, but how shiny they're getting.

56
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,852
Now, now. Hold still.

57
00:07:38,156 --> 00:07:41,353
Ready? Very, very handsome. Let me see.

58
00:08:10,252 --> 00:08:12,041
Hello.

59
00:08:14,124 --> 00:08:16,393
Get the gear.

60
00:08:17,067 --> 00:08:18,891
Get the gear.

61
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:22,818
- He didn't say ''Get the gear, Veeko.''
- l'm the supervisor. You get it.

62
00:08:22,925 --> 00:08:25,958
You got the blue sweater.
You help me get the gear.

63
00:08:35,563 --> 00:08:39,426
A most pleasant and
charming good day to you, sir.

64
00:08:39,883 --> 00:08:43,080
l am Mr Charlie,

65
00:08:43,435 --> 00:08:49,218
photographer de babe,
entirely at your service.

66
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:56,229
You were expecting us?

67
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,114
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.

68
00:09:02,187 --> 00:09:04,610
Whoa, look at this place!

69
00:09:07,051 --> 00:09:08,841
Eddie.

70
00:09:16,874 --> 00:09:22,242
We ain't here to nick no bric-a-brac.
We're here for the hit of a lifetime.

71
00:09:22,347 --> 00:09:25,162
You wanna be a shoplifter, go to JC Penney.

72
00:09:33,354 --> 00:09:35,331
You think we can get away with this?

73
00:09:35,435 --> 00:09:39,178
No. l'm here because l've got
a wild curiosity about the electric chair.

74
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:41,670
Sorry.

75
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,817
What a gorgeous baby.

76
00:10:06,924 --> 00:10:09,192
You must be so proud.

77
00:10:09,994 --> 00:10:11,882
l'm Mrs Cotwell.

78
00:10:11,946 --> 00:10:13,604
l am Mr Charlie.

79
00:10:14,859 --> 00:10:16,681
Shall we begin?

80
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:33,961
Mr Francis, if you will go to the vehicle
and retrieve my light meter.

81
00:10:42,634 --> 00:10:45,154
l'm going to be rich.

82
00:10:45,418 --> 00:10:48,004
l want individual photos of Baby Bink.

83
00:10:48,075 --> 00:10:51,521
Baby Bink? What
an absolutely delightful name.

84
00:10:51,627 --> 00:10:54,376
- lt's a pet name for Bennington.
- Certainly.

85
00:10:54,442 --> 00:10:58,403
l want individual photos of Baby Bink,
and then a portrait of the two of us.

86
00:10:58,475 --> 00:11:01,092
Whatever you wish, however you wish.

87
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:04,031
You photographed
the children of many of my friends.

88
00:11:04,171 --> 00:11:08,198
Those pictures are forever appearing
in newspapers and magazines.

89
00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:10,272
lt is true.

90
00:11:11,561 --> 00:11:15,009
- His picture's never been published.
- That cannot be.

91
00:11:15,082 --> 00:11:16,707
lt's true.

92
00:11:16,778 --> 00:11:23,171
l am sure in the not-so-distant future
this little fellow will be very well known.

93
00:11:24,905 --> 00:11:27,392
l want your very best. l want art.

94
00:11:27,498 --> 00:11:30,945
l want you to set a new standard
for beauty in baby photography.

95
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,858
l so welcome the challenge, madame.

96
00:11:33,931 --> 00:11:38,470
And, to that end, may l ask one small favor?

97
00:11:38,539 --> 00:11:41,920
May l have some time alone with the child?

98
00:11:46,698 --> 00:11:49,349
Oh, l need his complete attention.

99
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:55,201
The great bond between you and your son,
his love for you, will distract him.

100
00:11:55,307 --> 00:12:01,896
l need to study his marvelous little features,
to learn how best to photograph him.

101
00:12:01,993 --> 00:12:07,656
He does well with persons
he is not intimate with?

102
00:12:11,306 --> 00:12:13,313
Does he?

103
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,455
He's a friendly boy, but he may not like...

104
00:12:16,554 --> 00:12:18,276
Excellent!

105
00:12:18,698 --> 00:12:21,252
Madame, if l might make a suggestion.

106
00:12:21,834 --> 00:12:28,129
Your garment du jour, while
extremely magnificent, is so colorful,

107
00:12:28,202 --> 00:12:31,017
l am afraid it will dominate the photograph

108
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,496
and detract from your natural beauty.

109
00:12:36,362 --> 00:12:39,775
l knew this outfit was wrong.
l'll be back in 15 minutes.

110
00:12:40,457 --> 00:12:43,653
Take all the time you need.

111
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,238
lf he gets cranky,

112
00:12:50,344 --> 00:12:52,451
read him his book.

113
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,495
How invaluable.

114
00:12:56,169 --> 00:12:58,078
Thank you.

115
00:13:13,545 --> 00:13:15,846
Mr Andrews, get the winter wardrobe.

116
00:13:15,913 --> 00:13:18,334
- But, madam...
- Hurry, Gilbertine.

117
00:13:30,985 --> 00:13:33,157
There you go.

118
00:13:33,289 --> 00:13:35,262
Take the book.

119
00:13:46,247 --> 00:13:49,217
Bink really deserves this moment
in the spotlight.

120
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:52,769
lt's too bad the baby pictures
don't go on the front page.

121
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,951
- Ma'am?
- Yeah?

122
00:14:06,248 --> 00:14:08,222
We gotta make this fast.

123
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,182
l'm sorry it took so long.

124
00:14:36,711 --> 00:14:38,718
Where's Bink?

125
00:15:26,855 --> 00:15:28,581
Eddie?

126
00:15:28,648 --> 00:15:32,805
You're a smart guy. How do you tell
the front from the back on these diapers?

127
00:15:32,871 --> 00:15:35,293
Are there pockets in the front?

128
00:15:37,864 --> 00:15:43,134
- Very funny. The front and back are the same.
- Then it probably don't make no difference.

129
00:15:43,528 --> 00:15:48,831
Put him in them regular baby clothes. That
fruit suit's a dead giveaway he's a rich kid.

130
00:15:50,248 --> 00:15:52,734
Come on. Good boy.

131
00:16:21,894 --> 00:16:23,682
Ed?

132
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:26,946
How do l know this milk
won't burn the kid's throat?

133
00:16:27,046 --> 00:16:28,956
lf that matters.

134
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,584
Try it on some skin first.

135
00:16:39,654 --> 00:16:41,727
What's the matter with you?

136
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:44,638
l better let it cool down.

137
00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:50,402
You like that?

138
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,781
Eddie?

139
00:16:51,848 --> 00:16:53,854
Watch the baby.

140
00:16:59,494 --> 00:17:03,106
Very good. Now see if it works the other way.

141
00:17:09,702 --> 00:17:11,591
lt works.

142
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:20,420
Put him in the bedroom.

143
00:17:20,487 --> 00:17:24,643
The more he sleeps, the less attention
he draws from the neighbors.

144
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:27,393
- And keep an eye on him.
- Here you go, kid.

145
00:17:27,494 --> 00:17:30,592
That little doo-doo machine
is my retirement money.

146
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,539
All right.

147
00:17:33,637 --> 00:17:35,709
Nappy-nap time, little jerk.

148
00:17:39,687 --> 00:17:41,791
Go to sleep real nice

149
00:17:41,893 --> 00:17:44,676
cos Mr Teddy Bear over here,

150
00:17:44,743 --> 00:17:48,637
he's been up all night drinking with
the Barbie dolls and he needs his rest.

151
00:17:48,998 --> 00:17:51,452
All right. Drink your milk.

152
00:17:51,526 --> 00:17:53,217
Take your nap.

153
00:17:54,341 --> 00:17:56,578
Drink your milk! Take your nap!

154
00:17:59,589 --> 00:18:01,597
- Eddie!
- What?

155
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:05,697
You got any suggestions how you
get these things to eat and sleep?

156
00:18:06,246 --> 00:18:08,219
Sing him a song.

157
00:18:24,455 --> 00:18:30,205
~ Mary had a little lamb

158
00:18:32,165 --> 00:18:34,237
~ Little lamb

159
00:18:35,014 --> 00:18:36,988
~ Little lamb

160
00:18:37,764 --> 00:18:42,042
~ Mary had a little lamb

161
00:18:42,118 --> 00:18:45,314
~ Her hair was white as snow

162
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:50,784
~ And every which way that Mary went

163
00:18:50,886 --> 00:18:53,274
~ The lamb was right behind her

164
00:18:54,212 --> 00:18:56,548
~ lt followed her to work one day

165
00:18:56,647 --> 00:18:59,491
~ Work one day, work one day

166
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:03,332
~ lt followed her to work one day

167
00:19:03,397 --> 00:19:06,300
~ And Mary lost herjob

168
00:19:10,243 --> 00:19:13,212
Eddie! What else did Mary's little lamb do?

169
00:19:13,317 --> 00:19:16,252
Didn't he put Humpty Dumpty
back together again?

170
00:19:17,542 --> 00:19:19,842
That was Nat King Cole.

171
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:25,276
Nat King Cole stuck his finger in the pie
and yanked out the bird.

172
00:19:25,412 --> 00:19:30,201
How can a lamb put a Humpty
together again? He ain't got fingers.

173
00:19:30,404 --> 00:19:33,503
~ And then she went to unemployment...

174
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:37,600
Norby! Knock off the singin'
and read him his storybook.

175
00:19:39,365 --> 00:19:41,053
lf you can.

176
00:19:46,339 --> 00:19:48,315
Wanna hear a story?

177
00:19:51,204 --> 00:19:53,758
Let's see here. What do we got here?

178
00:20:02,019 --> 00:20:03,744
''Nanny...

179
00:20:03,876 --> 00:20:05,786
and Baby Boo...

180
00:20:07,843 --> 00:20:09,818
strolled...

181
00:20:09,893 --> 00:20:11,899
through...

182
00:20:11,972 --> 00:20:14,428
the great big...

183
00:20:16,899 --> 00:20:18,788
de...

184
00:20:20,517 --> 00:20:22,491
de...

185
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:26,750
- department.
- ..department store.''

186
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:30,529
''How many, many things there were to buy.''

187
00:20:31,139 --> 00:20:33,178
Or steal, if l was writin' that book.

188
00:20:34,051 --> 00:20:36,987
Or steal, if l was writin' this book.

189
00:21:10,403 --> 00:21:14,112
Mrs Cotwell? Dale Grissom, FBl.

190
00:21:14,211 --> 00:21:16,186
l'd like to ask you a few questions.

191
00:21:16,258 --> 00:21:18,462
You'll have to ask me later.

192
00:21:18,531 --> 00:21:22,971
- l'm going to look for my baby.
- l'd rather you didn't. l need you here.

193
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:26,680
- Don't coddle me, Mr Grissom.
- Mrs Cotwell,

194
00:21:26,755 --> 00:21:31,359
there are five million people in this city
and many places where your boy could be.

195
00:21:31,427 --> 00:21:35,965
lt would be pointless and dangerous
for you to go out searching for your baby.

196
00:21:36,065 --> 00:21:40,475
l've been through a number of these cases.
l understand how you feel.

197
00:21:42,275 --> 00:21:44,664
Have you ever lost a child?

198
00:21:45,507 --> 00:21:46,913
No, ma'am.

199
00:21:47,268 --> 00:21:49,723
Then you can't possibly know how l feel.

200
00:21:51,842 --> 00:21:55,618
l apologize. But would you stay here, please?

201
00:21:56,099 --> 00:21:58,336
For your baby's sake.

202
00:23:36,514 --> 00:23:38,488
Do you gotta do that?

203
00:23:41,345 --> 00:23:43,320
l like to look nice.

204
00:23:43,969 --> 00:23:45,944
You gotta spit?

205
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:51,675
l don't know about you,
but l don't eat pieces of my body.

206
00:24:23,265 --> 00:24:25,086
What?

207
00:24:25,889 --> 00:24:28,277
- What did l do?
- You spit on me.

208
00:24:28,352 --> 00:24:30,425
- l did not!
- Somebody did,

209
00:24:30,497 --> 00:24:32,700
and you're the only one in the room.

210
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,136
You jerk!

211
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:53,207
What? No, no. Quiet.

212
00:24:53,311 --> 00:24:56,160
- You're gonna wake up the baby.
- The baby's on the roof!

213
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,582
Hurry. Come on, hurry.

214
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,108
Eddie!

215
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:39,414
Ed. Hey, Ed, what happened?

216
00:25:40,511 --> 00:25:42,138
Eddie, are you OK?

217
00:25:45,791 --> 00:25:49,404
- People shouldn't leave this lying around.
- What are you doing, dope?

218
00:25:49,503 --> 00:25:51,609
lt was in the way.

219
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:54,239
- What happened?
- Right, pick him up.

220
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:56,310
Eddie. Ed, you're drooling.

221
00:25:56,383 --> 00:26:01,239
- Eddie, come on. Come on, Ed. Come on.
- Eddie, what happened? Eddie?

222
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,735
What? This way?

223
00:26:05,857 --> 00:26:08,442
Oh, great. lt's gotta be at least 1,000 feet.

224
00:26:08,513 --> 00:26:11,381
- Ed, we're gonna have to jump.
- We're gonnajump?

225
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:14,805
- Yes. On three. Ready?
- OK.

226
00:26:14,944 --> 00:26:15,958
One.

227
00:26:16,095 --> 00:26:17,622
Two.

228
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,688
Three.

229
00:26:26,591 --> 00:26:28,893
Eddie!

230
00:26:50,656 --> 00:26:52,989
Ed, look...

231
00:26:53,087 --> 00:26:54,911
out!

232
00:27:19,134 --> 00:27:21,884
- What?
- Package.

233
00:27:22,304 --> 00:27:26,613
- Where do you want me to sign?
- Anywhere's fine.

234
00:27:33,438 --> 00:27:35,829
Have a nice... day.

235
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,879
You old bat.

236
00:27:40,927 --> 00:27:43,774
- Which way?
- This way.

237
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,064
Ed!

238
00:27:59,134 --> 00:28:01,819
Are you all right?

239
00:28:01,887 --> 00:28:05,202
How can he be all right?
The guy fell off a building.

240
00:28:05,311 --> 00:28:10,066
Probably got contusions, concussions,
contractions. What's the matter with you?

241
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,595
- Just take it easy. How you feelin'?
- Eddie, how many fingers l got up?

242
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:35,540
- Two.
- Not you! Hey, Eddie, say somethin'.

243
00:28:35,614 --> 00:28:38,747
- Here, put him here.
- Sit down on the bench. Sit down.

244
00:28:39,071 --> 00:28:40,957
You OK?

245
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:42,613
Eddie.

246
00:28:42,686 --> 00:28:44,476
When we first seen you fall,

247
00:28:44,543 --> 00:28:49,246
our first thoughts were with you
and your family, should you not survive.

248
00:28:49,374 --> 00:28:51,676
- l prayed, Eddie.
- Shut up!

249
00:29:12,765 --> 00:29:16,114
All right, take it easy.
You wanna maybe get to the right of him.

250
00:29:22,334 --> 00:29:24,504
Wait, Eddie. We don't wanna get a ticket.

251
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:31,931
- Get to the right. Eddie, get to the right.
- Shut up!

252
00:29:34,621 --> 00:29:36,956
Move in front of him. l'll jump on the back.

253
00:29:37,021 --> 00:29:39,509
- You're makin' me nuts!
- OK. Don't get crazy.

254
00:29:43,549 --> 00:29:46,550
- Just drive. l'll tell you.
- See that lady over there?

255
00:29:46,622 --> 00:29:49,436
There he is! l see him! There he is!

256
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:52,181
We got him.

257
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:55,764
He's gone! We lost him!

258
00:30:03,678 --> 00:30:05,750
Look both ways!

259
00:30:07,454 --> 00:30:08,827
l think you hit a cat.

260
00:30:08,894 --> 00:30:13,052
Here's the bus. Eddie, you see it?
He's gettin' ahead of us, Eddie.

261
00:30:13,149 --> 00:30:15,352
There's the bus again.

262
00:30:19,965 --> 00:30:22,387
Driver, next stop, please.

263
00:30:36,828 --> 00:30:38,455
Wait, l don't see him.

264
00:30:44,892 --> 00:30:47,707
- There's the bus.
- l see the bus!

265
00:30:47,772 --> 00:30:49,747
l'll get him!

266
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,955
Wait! Wait! Stop the bus.

267
00:30:54,173 --> 00:30:56,059
l forgot somethin'! Stop the bus!

268
00:30:56,157 --> 00:30:59,452
Wait, wait, wait! Hello! Stop the bus!

269
00:30:59,517 --> 00:31:03,739
Halt! Stop the bus! Wait! Stop the bus!

270
00:31:08,156 --> 00:31:12,314
Did a baby get off this bus?
A little guy, about two feet tall.

271
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:15,729
- lt's an emergency!
- l didn't have nobody today with a baby.

272
00:31:15,933 --> 00:31:18,071
He was by himself!

273
00:31:21,372 --> 00:31:23,793
- What?
- He must have got off.

274
00:31:24,573 --> 00:31:26,810
Oh, great. We're through.

275
00:31:30,494 --> 00:31:33,340
lf you didn't park your van on the sidewalk,

276
00:31:33,405 --> 00:31:36,308
people could get by a lot easier.

277
00:31:39,132 --> 00:31:44,022
lf you'd limit yourself to a couple of pork
roasts a day, you wouldn't need to worry.

278
00:31:44,603 --> 00:31:45,979
You heard me.

279
00:31:52,636 --> 00:31:54,642
Some people.

280
00:31:57,725 --> 00:32:00,211
- Eddie, how could he get off?
- l seen him.

281
00:32:00,283 --> 00:32:02,901
- What?
- He's in the big broad's purse.

282
00:32:03,804 --> 00:32:08,986
Yeah, this is Carl in 157.
You know anything about a missing baby?

283
00:32:09,403 --> 00:32:12,666
l see her. How could you miss her?
She's as big as a building.

284
00:32:12,733 --> 00:32:15,961
- Eddie, let me do this.
- Will you stop it?

285
00:32:16,027 --> 00:32:20,151
- How do we do it?
- Nonchalant. We'll give her a sandwich.

286
00:32:20,219 --> 00:32:24,016
- She don't need a sandwich. Look at her.
- That's my whole point.

287
00:32:24,092 --> 00:32:26,328
Wait.

288
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:44,025
Eddie.

289
00:32:44,123 --> 00:32:46,098
Get her, Veeko! You get her, Veeko!

290
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:53,977
Get her, Veeko. You got her, Veek.
Hang in there, Veek. You got her! Come on!

291
00:32:54,204 --> 00:32:55,284
Who's next?

292
00:32:56,699 --> 00:33:01,074
How about you, Mr Comedy?
''We'll give her a sandwich,'' huh?

293
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:03,897
''As big as a building,'' huh?

294
00:33:03,964 --> 00:33:07,410
Not so easy making jokes
with my fist in your mouth, is it?

295
00:33:07,514 --> 00:33:10,298
- l'm not afraid of you.
- Come on. She's crazy.

296
00:33:10,395 --> 00:33:13,077
Anybody else wanna take a shot?

297
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:19,827
Chicken!

298
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:05,622
How did you get out of
Mother Goose Corner?

299
00:34:19,675 --> 00:34:22,578
So, you got a nasty little surprise for me?

300
00:34:28,857 --> 00:34:30,996
You guys are worthless!

301
00:34:31,066 --> 00:34:33,303
Yeah, right, Eddie. Blame us.

302
00:34:33,818 --> 00:34:38,226
- You know, l'm gettin' sick of your insults.
- Then why don't you quit?

303
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:42,872
- Oh, yeah? Let you two have all the money?
- What money? The kid is gone!

304
00:34:43,452 --> 00:34:45,817
There you go, my little escape artist.

305
00:34:49,881 --> 00:34:54,487
Now, if you were a baby
lost in the big city, where would you go?

306
00:35:16,985 --> 00:35:21,492
,,speculation, but a ransom figure
in the millions of dollars was mentioned,

307
00:35:21,594 --> 00:35:26,645
Security is tight around the Cotwell mansion
and at Cotwell lndustry Towers downtown,

308
00:35:26,746 --> 00:35:29,235
Ronnie Lee has more on the story, Ronnie?

309
00:35:29,338 --> 00:35:32,207
There's no word from police,
but our sources tell us

310
00:35:32,313 --> 00:35:36,753
that a nine-month-old baby boy was abducted
at approximately ten o'clock this morning,

311
00:35:36,858 --> 00:35:39,892
We have confirmed that
a photographer and two assistants

312
00:35:39,993 --> 00:35:42,513
from the Downtown
Baby Photographers studio

313
00:35:42,586 --> 00:35:46,415
were scheduled to photograph
the missing child today,

314
00:35:46,521 --> 00:35:49,619
A spokesman for the photography
studio declined to comment,

315
00:36:15,065 --> 00:36:21,623
,,extremely tight, ln fact, police
and FBl units have sealed off the area,

316
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:26,125
Earlier l attempted to reach millionaire
Bennington Cotwell at his office.

317
00:36:26,522 --> 00:36:31,824
Though reporters were turned away,
a reliable source informed us that Cotwell...

318
00:36:35,354 --> 00:36:38,583
A spokesman for the company said
that Mr Cotwell was unavailable.

319
00:36:43,544 --> 00:36:47,768
Hang on a second. Keep rolling. OK.

320
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,396
Where'd he go?

321
00:37:29,113 --> 00:37:31,152
We're always, like, this close.

322
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,497
- Hello.
- Hello, ls this Mr Cotwell?

323
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,658
- Yes. Who is this?
- My name's Depke, Joe, Joe Depke,

324
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:58,194
Yeah, Listen, l might have some information
on the whereabouts of that child,

325
00:38:07,767 --> 00:38:10,223
- l seen the baby.
- Where?

326
00:38:10,327 --> 00:38:12,334
Right across the street on the curb.

327
00:38:12,408 --> 00:38:14,349
Where'd he go?

328
00:38:16,951 --> 00:38:20,114
lt's the craziest thing. l don't remember.

329
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:22,998
Maybe we'll take a ride.
See if you remember then.

330
00:38:23,096 --> 00:38:26,411
- You want money? How much?
- Don't embarrass me. Don't insult me.

331
00:38:26,521 --> 00:38:29,782
- Your money's no good here. Put it away.
- Where's the baby?

332
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:31,889
House across the street.

333
00:38:32,952 --> 00:38:34,959
Second floor.

334
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:40,083
McCrays. No guarantee.
Listen, mister, l didn't know your kid.

335
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:42,191
l just saw his picture on TV.

336
00:38:43,319 --> 00:38:45,707
l called because l care.

337
00:38:53,911 --> 00:38:57,041
- Your name's McCray?
- Yeah. What did l do?

338
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:59,828
We're looking for a missing child.

339
00:38:59,927 --> 00:39:03,124
- These are my kids.
- Mind if we take a look?

340
00:39:07,414 --> 00:39:09,422
Hello, ma'am.

341
00:39:14,839 --> 00:39:17,107
Hi.

342
00:39:18,968 --> 00:39:20,942
Sir, in here.

343
00:39:31,991 --> 00:39:33,550
Baby.

344
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:01,005
You have a beautiful little boy.

345
00:40:03,862 --> 00:40:05,838
Thank you, ma'am.

346
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,165
l'll pray he comes back to you.

347
00:40:10,839 --> 00:40:15,444
These kids are all l've got, so l know
how l'd feel if l was in your place.

348
00:40:16,503 --> 00:40:18,477
l hope you never are.

349
00:40:20,405 --> 00:40:22,610
For your children's sake.

350
00:40:31,927 --> 00:40:33,933
Sorry we inconvenienced you.

351
00:40:35,094 --> 00:40:37,070
Be there in a second.

352
00:40:40,277 --> 00:40:43,244
- l'm sorry for the trouble.
- Sir?

353
00:40:44,342 --> 00:40:50,058
l believe in my heart that someone
somewhere watches over the babies.

354
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,087
Yes, l hope so.

355
00:41:00,181 --> 00:41:02,548
You have everything? Are you sure?

356
00:41:23,221 --> 00:41:27,661
l can't believe this. You know,
it ain't the wisest strategy to kidnap a baby

357
00:41:27,733 --> 00:41:30,450
and then let the damn thing
loose on the streets.

358
00:41:30,549 --> 00:41:34,771
Babies crawling in traffic tend
to draw attention, don't you think?

359
00:41:44,021 --> 00:41:47,470
To the left, l think. You see? The cab.

360
00:41:58,007 --> 00:42:00,014
Got you now, you little...

361
00:42:07,189 --> 00:42:10,059
- Eddie!
- My money!

362
00:42:21,749 --> 00:42:24,531
Come on! Come on! Go! Go!

363
00:42:28,373 --> 00:42:30,282
Go! No, wait!

364
00:42:32,149 --> 00:42:33,936
Stay! Stay there!

365
00:42:34,037 --> 00:42:36,012
Stay there!

366
00:42:36,918 --> 00:42:38,324
Don't go!

367
00:42:39,381 --> 00:42:41,553
Go! Now! Watch your feet.

368
00:42:44,821 --> 00:42:46,227
Stay there!

369
00:42:46,293 --> 00:42:49,675
OK, hang on. One, two, three - go.

370
00:43:05,461 --> 00:43:10,546
l worked at Burger King three years.
This is worse than that.

371
00:43:10,644 --> 00:43:14,638
Don't blame me. We'd be restin' easy
if Butterfingers here hadn't lost the kid.

372
00:43:14,709 --> 00:43:18,385
l lost the kid? l lost the kid?
Oh, well, that's news to me.

373
00:43:18,485 --> 00:43:21,997
- Who fell asleep reading nursery stories?
- Who left the window open?

374
00:43:24,628 --> 00:43:27,945
- That was me.
- You idiots are why we don't got the kid.

375
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:33,717
As far as l'm concerned, you can drop out and
l'll keep the $5m. You don't deserve a penny.

376
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:36,364
- You'd stiff us?
- Wait a minute!

377
00:43:36,436 --> 00:43:41,138
Don't get hot, Eddie. Don't get hot.
We're all just tired from gettin' torn apart.

378
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:45,908
Like l like to fall off buildings
and jump in ditches! That's the breaks.

379
00:43:45,972 --> 00:43:47,858
We're dealing with a baby.

380
00:43:47,922 --> 00:43:51,436
Babies are obviously
more dangerous than we thought.

381
00:43:51,508 --> 00:43:54,159
lt don't figure, Eddie. They're so small.

382
00:43:54,229 --> 00:43:57,577
When l boxed, the guys l most feared
were those who feared nothin'.

383
00:43:57,652 --> 00:44:00,880
Babies are like that -
they ain't afraid of nothin'.

384
00:44:04,629 --> 00:44:06,319
Baby tracks.

385
00:44:25,716 --> 00:44:27,951
Norby, hey.

386
00:45:26,931 --> 00:45:29,681
The kid's in the gorilla cage.

387
00:45:31,986 --> 00:45:34,354
There goes our five million bucks, huh?

388
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:38,540
l think the ape likes the kid.

389
00:45:49,076 --> 00:45:52,685
- What?
- You got long arms.

390
00:45:55,091 --> 00:45:57,001
Thanks.

391
00:46:03,825 --> 00:46:05,713
l can't reach him, Eddie.

392
00:46:07,954 --> 00:46:10,442
That's it. You got it.

393
00:46:15,602 --> 00:46:17,611
Easy does it.

394
00:46:18,225 --> 00:46:21,576
That's it. Slow, slow, slow. There.

395
00:46:21,683 --> 00:46:23,275
Easy.

396
00:46:43,506 --> 00:46:45,895
Nice monkey.

397
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:48,424
Yes.

398
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:52,815
He's startin' to cry, Eddie.
He'll make the monkey mad.

399
00:46:55,537 --> 00:46:56,967
Eddie, he's gettin' up.

400
00:46:57,586 --> 00:47:01,515
- l'm afraid, Eddie.
- Freeze. Just stare him down.

401
00:47:06,834 --> 00:47:08,841
That's it.

402
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,252
Shut up!

403
00:48:29,681 --> 00:48:32,169
Hey, King Kong. Hey, over here.

404
00:48:32,912 --> 00:48:35,018
l'm a banana.

405
00:48:35,154 --> 00:48:39,047
l'm a coconut. l'm an entire fruit salad.

406
00:48:39,376 --> 00:48:41,995
Over here. Hey, look. l'm the Jungle Boy.

407
00:48:42,096 --> 00:48:45,512
Over here. That's it.

408
00:48:46,097 --> 00:48:48,071
Now you got it.

409
00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:52,074
l got him.

410
00:48:56,497 --> 00:48:58,252
l got him.

411
00:49:01,713 --> 00:49:04,363
Bad monkey.

412
00:50:50,768 --> 00:50:52,742
- Eddie?
- Careful, Eddie.

413
00:52:16,109 --> 00:52:18,116
Eddie.

414
00:52:19,726 --> 00:52:22,148
l know you don't wanna hear this, but...

415
00:52:25,166 --> 00:52:27,140
the kid's gone again.

416
00:53:25,005 --> 00:53:28,715
This morning all l wanted
was my baby's picture in the paper.

417
00:53:35,756 --> 00:53:37,797
l got my wish.

418
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:43,075
Where's your mommy?

419
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:20,071
Hey, Eddie, maybe
he went down a rabbit hole.

420
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:24,199
We're serious about our work.
You wanna make jokes, join the circus.

421
00:54:26,925 --> 00:54:28,714
Bozo.

422
00:54:36,749 --> 00:54:39,749
Step on it, Eddie. Baby, starboard side.

423
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:42,155
- Starboard.
- What?

424
00:54:42,253 --> 00:54:44,260
- Port.
- What is that?

425
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:45,738
- Point!
- Nine o'clock!

426
00:54:45,805 --> 00:54:48,586
- Where is he?
- Over here at 6:30.

427
00:54:50,542 --> 00:54:51,751
Step on it.

428
00:54:53,547 --> 00:54:55,969
You're ours now, moneybags.

429
00:55:05,965 --> 00:55:09,095
Did Baby Bink miss his Uncle Eddie?

430
00:55:12,172 --> 00:55:14,178
- Come here.
- Get him.

431
00:55:17,036 --> 00:55:19,424
- Did you get him?
- No! Come on!

432
00:55:30,091 --> 00:55:32,133
Where'd he go?

433
00:55:32,205 --> 00:55:35,203
He went down a rabbit hole.

434
00:55:37,003 --> 00:55:41,738
- Don't let those rabbits chew your face off.
- Shut up, Veeko. Just shut up!

435
00:55:43,372 --> 00:55:48,521
No problem, fellas. lt ain't a hole,
it's a tunnel. And what's every tunnel got?

436
00:55:48,587 --> 00:55:51,271
Don't tell me. l know, l know. lt's a...

437
00:55:52,076 --> 00:55:54,181
Toll booth at the end.

438
00:55:54,251 --> 00:55:57,962
Are you always this stupid,
or do you do this just to annoy me?

439
00:55:58,061 --> 00:56:02,851
A tunnel has two ends.
This one's here, and the other one's...

440
00:56:02,956 --> 00:56:05,257
Where? Come on.

441
00:56:18,604 --> 00:56:21,799
- Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.
- Get him, Norby. Get him.

442
00:56:21,866 --> 00:56:24,966
- Don't let him get away.
- Here he is, Eddie.

443
00:56:27,051 --> 00:56:30,117
Today ain't your lucky day, eh, shorty-pants?

444
00:56:31,979 --> 00:56:34,314
That wasn't so hard.

445
00:57:10,379 --> 00:57:13,760
- Beautiful day, huh?
- You know anything about that vehicle?

446
00:57:19,146 --> 00:57:21,667
Yes. lt belongs to us.

447
00:57:21,738 --> 00:57:23,560
You left the engine running.

448
00:57:23,851 --> 00:57:25,379
Yes.

449
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:27,425
l did.

450
00:57:27,498 --> 00:57:31,076
l've been having battery trouble.

451
00:57:32,074 --> 00:57:35,522
We just stopped by to admire the beauti...

452
00:57:37,642 --> 00:57:40,937
beautiful flowers.

453
00:57:48,491 --> 00:57:51,359
Have you guys seen a baby around here?

454
00:57:51,563 --> 00:57:53,536
The park is full of...

455
00:57:55,242 --> 00:57:58,590
- babies.
- Yeah, well, there's been a kidnapping.

456
00:57:58,699 --> 00:58:01,086
Well, that's a cryin' shame.

457
00:58:01,418 --> 00:58:04,036
lt's amazing what people will do for money.

458
00:58:04,107 --> 00:58:06,080
Yeah, for five million...

459
00:58:07,211 --> 00:58:09,283
lf we see anything...

460
00:58:13,130 --> 00:58:14,821
Excuse me.

461
00:58:15,594 --> 00:58:19,588
lf we see anything, we'll be sure to notify...

462
00:58:47,754 --> 00:58:49,795
He's got a bad heart.

463
00:58:58,697 --> 00:59:00,673
Excuse me.

464
00:59:03,144 --> 00:59:05,120
The police.

465
00:59:05,898 --> 00:59:07,807
Thank you.

466
00:59:11,498 --> 00:59:16,286
Walk 'em to the car. My entire reproductive
system is about to go up in flames.

467
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:24,423
ls that a Fleetline van?

468
00:59:26,761 --> 00:59:28,737
Eddie, is it?

469
00:59:29,737 --> 00:59:32,192
- Yes!
- Yes, it is.

470
00:59:32,297 --> 00:59:34,336
l thought so.

471
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:37,223
My brother drives one
for a dry-cleaning firm.

472
00:59:37,321 --> 00:59:39,841
Oh, yeah, they drive a lot of those.

473
00:59:39,913 --> 00:59:42,302
He's always had a lot of trouble with his.

474
00:59:42,378 --> 00:59:47,744
Give me a second, l'll think of what he said
is the problem with the electrical system.

475
00:59:47,849 --> 00:59:49,823
- Alternator?
- No.

476
00:59:49,896 --> 00:59:52,200
- Carburetor?
- No.

477
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:56,641
- There's this little relay thing.
- Veeko!

478
00:59:56,713 --> 00:59:58,752
Veeko.

479
00:59:58,825 --> 01:00:02,087
l think you should move the van.

480
01:00:02,186 --> 01:00:04,355
l have a frog in my throat.

481
01:00:06,023 --> 01:00:09,473
And a brush fire in my undershorts.
Get 'em outta here.

482
01:00:09,544 --> 01:00:13,952
lt's just a bad battery. l think we should
move it before the engine dies.

483
01:00:14,026 --> 01:00:18,782
Yeah, it's just the battery.
Let's get it outta here. Come on, let's...

484
01:00:28,201 --> 01:00:30,338
You sure can tell summer's here.

485
01:00:30,441 --> 01:00:32,809
People got those barbecues goin'.

486
01:00:36,583 --> 01:00:40,578
- Smells great, doesn't it?
- Come on, let's go move the van.

487
01:00:47,783 --> 01:00:49,606
l'll be right with you.

488
01:00:52,488 --> 01:00:55,206
l just have a cramp in my leg.

489
01:01:09,096 --> 01:01:10,885
Take it easy.

490
01:01:50,696 --> 01:01:52,964
That's how you put out campfires.

491
01:01:53,127 --> 01:01:56,227
ls that a fact?

492
01:01:56,328 --> 01:01:58,303
Used to do it in Boy Scouts.

493
01:02:00,071 --> 01:02:02,886
You toasted your marshmallows

494
01:02:02,951 --> 01:02:06,694
over a pile of flaming gonads?

495
01:02:07,879 --> 01:02:10,017
We usually used logs.

496
01:02:11,495 --> 01:02:13,404
Follow that kid!

497
01:02:13,479 --> 01:02:16,129
We'll meet you on the other side.

498
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,982
l'm sorry, man, but it was an emergency.

499
01:02:19,048 --> 01:02:22,047
- You were blazin' pretty hard...
- Shut up!

500
01:02:30,662 --> 01:02:32,670
Oh, boy, Eddie.

501
01:02:32,775 --> 01:02:35,557
You got burnt clear through your skivvies.

502
01:02:37,896 --> 01:02:40,512
Baby Bink! lt's your mother!

503
01:02:40,583 --> 01:02:42,109
Baby Bink!

504
01:02:42,214 --> 01:02:45,062
l'll kill him.

505
01:03:23,269 --> 01:03:25,410
l'm sorry, ma'am.

506
01:03:31,111 --> 01:03:33,498
l haven't forgotten your feelings.

507
01:03:35,782 --> 01:03:37,789
My feelings don't matter.

508
01:03:48,999 --> 01:03:51,006
Yes, they do.

509
01:03:51,782 --> 01:03:53,724
They do very much.

510
01:03:55,974 --> 01:03:59,138
The love my baby's gotten
has been as much yours as mine.

511
01:04:02,759 --> 01:04:04,731
Probably more.

512
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:13,373
Where's my little boy?

513
01:04:16,422 --> 01:04:18,659
What's he doing?

514
01:04:22,791 --> 01:04:26,618
lf he were home,
he'd be going down for his nap.

515
01:07:21,572 --> 01:07:23,777
l got bad news.

516
01:07:23,844 --> 01:07:25,884
The kid's...

517
01:07:26,851 --> 01:07:28,826
in there.

518
01:07:29,316 --> 01:07:31,290
No, wait. Eddie, there's a guard.

519
01:07:31,428 --> 01:07:34,211
Eddie, no. Eddie, wait. No.

520
01:07:34,308 --> 01:07:37,440
- There's a guard.
- He's asleep, you moron.

521
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:44,095
Where is he? Come on,
knucklehead. Where is he, huh?

522
01:07:50,532 --> 01:07:52,538
Of course.

523
01:07:52,802 --> 01:07:54,842
Where else would he be?

524
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:01,594
Let's go get him.

525
01:08:31,138 --> 01:08:33,311
Eddie.

526
01:08:33,411 --> 01:08:35,319
Baby, 12 o'clock.

527
01:08:39,106 --> 01:08:40,633
Up there.

528
01:08:46,531 --> 01:08:49,116
We'll be with you in just a minute.

529
01:08:54,978 --> 01:08:58,972
Lingerie, home furnishings,
men's hats, babies.

530
01:09:01,187 --> 01:09:05,594
- Wait a minute. We passed him.
- Yes, moron. We'll grab him as he goes by.

531
01:09:05,665 --> 01:09:09,310
Yeah, that's a good plan, Ed.
We grab him as he comes by.

532
01:09:09,378 --> 01:09:11,387
You grab him.

533
01:09:12,129 --> 01:09:14,107
- l grab him?
- Right.

534
01:09:15,235 --> 01:09:18,464
As the girder comes up,
you jump out on it and grab the baby.

535
01:09:18,530 --> 01:09:22,524
- Me? By myself?
- You just step out on it. lt ain't difficult.

536
01:09:23,010 --> 01:09:25,629
- Why me?
- Norby's scared of heights.

537
01:09:25,763 --> 01:09:28,217
- Why don't you grab him?
- Nobody asked me!

538
01:09:37,506 --> 01:09:40,352
OK, OK. That's it.

539
01:09:40,418 --> 01:09:42,590
- Come on, don't miss him.
- l'll get it.

540
01:09:42,659 --> 01:09:44,633
Don't miss it. He's coming.

541
01:09:46,243 --> 01:09:51,098
- All right. Don't grab, OK?
- l'm not touching you. There it is. Go!

542
01:10:02,402 --> 01:10:04,310
Here he comes.

543
01:10:08,226 --> 01:10:10,495
How'd he do that?

544
01:10:11,842 --> 01:10:13,818
Baby luck.

545
01:10:26,690 --> 01:10:29,024
Eddie! Help me!

546
01:10:30,625 --> 01:10:33,854
- He asked for you, Ed.
- He ain't thinkin' straight.

547
01:10:33,922 --> 01:10:36,126
- Don't look down.
- What are you doin'?

548
01:10:36,194 --> 01:10:40,448
- Eddie, no! l'm gonna faint!
- Didn't l tell you not to look down?

549
01:10:40,546 --> 01:10:42,814
- Pull me back, please!
- l'm losing my grip.

550
01:10:42,881 --> 01:10:45,598
- Pull me back, please.
- Grab him by the leg.

551
01:10:45,698 --> 01:10:47,868
Grab him by the leg or l'll let you go!

552
01:10:47,937 --> 01:10:50,522
Don't look down.

553
01:10:50,592 --> 01:10:52,504
OK, good. You got him.

554
01:10:57,346 --> 01:10:58,720
Up!

555
01:11:01,697 --> 01:11:04,348
You're going the wrong way! Come up!

556
01:11:04,417 --> 01:11:07,133
- Rest on my feet.
- l could use a hand here!

557
01:11:07,232 --> 01:11:10,102
Hey, quit being a crybaby. Get up.

558
01:11:15,394 --> 01:11:18,176
You're doin' good, but you gotta get back up.

559
01:11:18,242 --> 01:11:20,542
- l'm losin' him, Eddie.
- Quit foolin' around.

560
01:11:20,641 --> 01:11:22,232
Gimme a hand.

561
01:11:25,825 --> 01:11:27,199
What's the matter with you?

562
01:11:40,929 --> 01:11:42,357
Ed?

563
01:11:44,482 --> 01:11:46,870
- Eddie?
- Get off of me.

564
01:11:56,032 --> 01:11:58,421
There he is.

565
01:11:58,497 --> 01:12:00,918
Come on, we'll take the stairs.

566
01:12:54,431 --> 01:12:56,537
lt's comin' back down. Get ready.

567
01:12:59,872 --> 01:13:02,687
- Now, jump.
- l'll wait for another.

568
01:13:02,753 --> 01:13:04,824
No, don't wait. Jump.

569
01:13:04,959 --> 01:13:06,933
Jump!

570
01:13:32,479 --> 01:13:34,270
My...

571
01:13:34,335 --> 01:13:36,124
spine.

572
01:14:43,615 --> 01:14:46,233
- l lived.
- Get back up here!

573
01:14:54,303 --> 01:14:56,824
Come here, you little ball of grief!

574
01:14:59,582 --> 01:15:03,379
Now l gotcha! You ain't
gonna crawl away from this one.

575
01:15:31,965 --> 01:15:33,461
That hurt!

576
01:16:06,301 --> 01:16:08,123
That's it!

577
01:16:08,957 --> 01:16:11,577
No mercy!

578
01:16:15,773 --> 01:16:20,858
This ain't no nursery-school
battle of wits anymore.

579
01:16:21,149 --> 01:16:26,364
This is my five foot, ten inches
of guile, gut and gristle

580
01:16:26,430 --> 01:16:31,896
versus your two and a half feet
of goo-goos, ga-gas and giggles.

581
01:16:35,901 --> 01:16:38,584
lf the Mil...

582
01:16:45,597 --> 01:16:48,281
lf the Milwaukee Mob couldn't kill me,

583
01:16:48,381 --> 01:16:54,229
no milk-puking little thumb-sucker's
got a candle's chance in a cyclone

584
01:16:54,333 --> 01:16:56,472
of gettin' the better of me.

585
01:17:01,469 --> 01:17:03,444
Where are you going?

586
01:17:07,422 --> 01:17:09,209
Come back here.

587
01:17:12,126 --> 01:17:15,354
This isn't funny anymore.

588
01:17:18,460 --> 01:17:20,827
My money!

589
01:19:16,412 --> 01:19:18,038
What?

590
01:19:18,108 --> 01:19:20,790
l thought l saw a baby
crawl around the corner.

591
01:19:23,002 --> 01:19:24,979
Good night, Donald.

592
01:19:59,739 --> 01:20:01,713
Norby!

593
01:20:02,810 --> 01:20:04,720
Veeko!

594
01:20:06,138 --> 01:20:09,238
Ed! We're down here!

595
01:20:16,827 --> 01:20:18,835
Hey, Ed!

596
01:20:20,763 --> 01:20:23,096
We better go before l dry!

597
01:20:23,994 --> 01:20:26,810
Ed, can you see the baby from up there?

598
01:20:27,740 --> 01:20:31,514
Just hang on and we'll come on up.
l got an idea.

599
01:20:41,851 --> 01:20:45,626
We got some news. l don't know
if it's good, but it's not bad.

600
01:20:45,722 --> 01:20:48,472
Since the media broke the story,
calls have come in.

601
01:20:48,668 --> 01:20:52,082
There was a report of a man
looking for a baby on a bus this morning.

602
01:20:52,443 --> 01:20:55,574
A baby missing from
a department store care center.

603
01:20:56,826 --> 01:20:59,509
Another, at three o'clock, at the zoo.

604
01:20:59,578 --> 01:21:03,352
Shortly after that at a downtown park.
And a final report not long ago at...

605
01:21:03,418 --> 01:21:06,835
- A building under construction.
- Yeah, that's right.

606
01:21:09,306 --> 01:21:11,478
He's doing everything in the book.

607
01:21:16,218 --> 01:21:18,192
l know where he is.

608
01:21:19,258 --> 01:21:21,528
''Before returning home for supper,

609
01:21:21,594 --> 01:21:27,028
Nanny and Baby Boo stopped at
the Old Soldiers' Home to visit Mr Tinsel.''

610
01:21:27,131 --> 01:21:29,497
That's where he is.

611
01:22:24,443 --> 01:22:26,416
Come on over.

612
01:22:27,545 --> 01:22:30,393
lt's the kid, on television! The one that...

613
01:22:35,705 --> 01:22:38,387
Come on. That's it. Come on.

614
01:22:53,753 --> 01:22:57,463
~ This is the army, Mr Jones

615
01:22:57,528 --> 01:23:01,327
~ No private rooms or telephones

616
01:23:01,432 --> 01:23:04,728
~ You had your breakfast in bed before

617
01:23:04,792 --> 01:23:09,200
~ But you won't get it there anymore

618
01:23:09,304 --> 01:23:12,949
~ This is the army, Mr Brown

619
01:23:13,017 --> 01:23:16,215
~ You and your baby went to town

620
01:23:16,666 --> 01:23:20,047
~ She had you worried, but this is war

621
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:23,983
~ And she won't worry you anymore

622
01:23:24,186 --> 01:23:27,665
~ No, she won't worry you

623
01:23:27,770 --> 01:23:31,381
~ Anymore

624
01:23:47,897 --> 01:23:49,870
Baby.

625
01:24:12,247 --> 01:24:14,452
You had quite an adventure today.

626
01:24:14,552 --> 01:24:16,340
Boo-boo.

627
01:24:19,032 --> 01:24:22,861
- Boo-boo?
- lt's what he calls his book. He lost it today.

628
01:24:22,967 --> 01:24:26,284
We'll get you another one, sweetheart.

629
01:24:29,306 --> 01:24:30,581
What?

630
01:24:32,470 --> 01:24:34,130
What?

631
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:36,753
Oh, l see. That's nice.

632
01:24:38,167 --> 01:24:41,234
That's not a boo-boo.
That's a clock. A ticktock.

633
01:24:41,304 --> 01:24:44,206
- Was there a ticktock in his book?
- No.

634
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:49,135
Well, he's pointing to...

635
01:24:50,872 --> 01:24:55,029
His boo-boo. He's not pointing
at the ticktock. He wants his boo-boo.

636
01:24:55,095 --> 01:24:59,799
- l thought he was getting a new boo-boo.
- He means his boo-boo's back there.

637
01:25:01,367 --> 01:25:06,736
Radio Rogers and McCloskey. Tell them we're
going to the ticktock to get the boo-boo.

638
01:25:06,807 --> 01:25:08,630
And send for backup.

639
01:25:59,256 --> 01:26:04,526
Hey, Eddie, you sure you don't wanna
go check to see if they left the money?

640
01:26:04,631 --> 01:26:07,086
Oh, that's a good idea.

641
01:26:07,157 --> 01:26:10,290
We get the living hell
tore out of us by a baby!

642
01:26:10,455 --> 01:26:15,027
Three fully grown men versus
15 pounds of pink flesh with a mouth.

643
01:26:15,286 --> 01:26:20,753
What chance have we got of strolling into
that alley and coming out with anything less

644
01:26:20,823 --> 01:26:23,246
- than 140 years in prison?
- No way.

645
01:26:23,319 --> 01:26:25,327
No, thank you!

646
01:26:25,399 --> 01:26:29,653
This is a hexed situation.
We walk away while we're still ahead.

647
01:26:29,750 --> 01:26:32,467
We took a lickin' and kept on tickin'.

648
01:26:32,534 --> 01:26:34,194
We'll go back to banks.

649
01:26:34,456 --> 01:26:37,716
Dealing with grownups.
l don't want no kiddy stuff.

650
01:26:37,813 --> 01:26:41,972
- We did all right with banks.
- Or a convenience store once in a while.

651
01:26:42,070 --> 01:26:48,779
You know, one thing l learned from all this:
l ain't never gonna have any kids of my own.

652
01:26:50,806 --> 01:26:56,043
Yeah, seeing as you burnt down the only tree
in your forest, l wouldn't worry about it.

653
01:26:58,358 --> 01:27:00,083
Why don't you shut up?

654
01:27:00,535 --> 01:27:05,326
l don't wanna ever hear another word
about that rotten, snake-bit baby.

655
01:27:07,766 --> 01:27:09,359
l'm serious!

656
01:27:14,486 --> 01:27:16,975
l'm hearing that little vermin in my thoughts.

657
01:27:17,046 --> 01:27:19,379
l wanna erase him from my mind.

658
01:27:22,101 --> 01:27:24,141
Did you hear that?

659
01:27:25,046 --> 01:27:28,014
- Yeah.
- You know what it sounds like?

660
01:27:45,461 --> 01:27:47,731
He's back.

661
01:28:09,525 --> 01:28:12,110
You dirty, no-good little stool pigeon!

662
01:28:12,212 --> 01:28:15,476
You're surrounded. Throw down the boo-boo.

663
01:28:20,181 --> 01:28:22,767
And put your hands over your heads.

664
01:29:04,565 --> 01:29:06,540
This is the end of the story.

665
01:29:32,085 --> 01:29:33,939
Good night, sweetheart.

666
01:29:34,580 --> 01:29:36,556
Good night, Bink.

667
01:29:44,308 --> 01:29:48,399
Did l tell you? The baby's
having his picture taken tomorrow,

668
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:51,348
- Say hello to old Willy,
- l will,
