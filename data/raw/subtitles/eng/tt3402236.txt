1
00:00:54,616 --> 00:00:58,112
<i>The Wailing Wall, Jerusalem.
1934</i>

2
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:32,103
<i>He said four minutes precisely.</i>

3
00:01:47,379 --> 00:01:48,379
Quickly, move.

4
00:02:02,134 --> 00:02:04,661
Two perfect eggs this time, no?

5
00:02:22,621 --> 00:02:23,979
Maybe.

6
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:29,684
I blame the chicken.

7
00:02:30,545 --> 00:02:32,225
Why do hens lay eggs
of different sizes.

8
00:02:32,499 --> 00:02:35,209
It's not you, " Mon'Amie."
These are two perfectly cooked eggs.

9
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:36,522
Mr. Poirot...

10
00:02:36,602 --> 00:02:38,042
I have got 3 religions bent on riot.

11
00:02:38,321 --> 00:02:40,921
If you are going to perform one of
your miracles, the time is now.

12
00:02:43,071 --> 00:02:45,616
Have the eggs.

13
00:02:54,143 --> 00:02:55,562
Poirot!

14
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:59,427
Sorry for the, um...

15
00:03:03,007 --> 00:03:04,678
It is not the...

16
00:03:06,045 --> 00:03:09,194
It is the imbalance of the...

17
00:03:16,682 --> 00:03:17,682
Right.

18
00:03:17,869 --> 00:03:18,917
That's better.

19
00:03:19,275 --> 00:03:21,406
<i>Excuse me. Let's move on
Make way, please.</i>

20
00:03:23,067 --> 00:03:24,147
For the accused.

21
00:03:25,457 --> 00:03:26,729
The rabbi...

22
00:03:27,818 --> 00:03:29,090
the priest...

23
00:03:30,065 --> 00:03:31,370
and the Imam.

24
00:03:33,508 --> 00:03:36,348
It is like the...
old joke, yes?

25
00:03:36,511 --> 00:03:38,570
The rabbi, the priest and the imam.

26
00:03:41,437 --> 00:03:43,384
Forgive me, I'm Belgian.

27
00:03:43,562 --> 00:03:45,121
So, let us begin.

28
00:03:47,048 --> 00:03:49,719
In the church of the
Holy Sepulcher above us!

29
00:03:49,886 --> 00:03:52,576
<i>Three representatives meet
under the supervision...</i>

30
00:03:52,842 --> 00:03:57,497
<i>of the Chief Inspector of the Police to
discuss a divided timetable for market use.</i>

31
00:03:58,402 --> 00:04:00,066
<i>One hour after this tense meeting...</i>

32
00:04:00,343 --> 00:04:03,182
<i>a priceless relic is found to be stolen.</i>

33
00:04:04,201 --> 00:04:09,842
It is said one of
these three men has stolen it.

34
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:13,706
The police find no pieces
of evidence at all.

35
00:04:13,917 --> 00:04:16,426
I find one.

36
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:21,188
<i>On the meticulously well
kept wall of a fresco...</i>

37
00:04:21,501 --> 00:04:26,138
<i>a single crack from an
indelicate client..</i>

38
00:04:26,178 --> 00:04:30,645
<i>With a hard-soled
shoe or perhaps a boot.</i>

39
00:04:35,594 --> 00:04:38,097
So, ladies and gentlemen,
we must ask...

40
00:04:38,301 --> 00:04:41,111
Who stands to benefit from the crime?

41
00:04:42,985 --> 00:04:45,729
Our three holy men live humbly.

42
00:04:46,772 --> 00:04:49,246
They have thin
soled shoes, poor.

43
00:04:49,994 --> 00:04:54,625
Sudden riches
and rubies would be...

44
00:04:54,813 --> 00:04:57,533
too conspicuous, yes? To enjoy,
they do not getting it.

45
00:04:57,746 --> 00:05:00,362
At this point, we need, an armed
guard at the south gate,

46
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:02,555
Thank you very much.

47
00:05:02,858 --> 00:05:04,000
Now, the only one...

48
00:05:04,238 --> 00:05:08,809
who benefits from the theft
and the unrest it causes...

49
00:05:09,001 --> 00:05:12,463
is a man whose office I
had searched this morning...

50
00:05:12,702 --> 00:05:15,582
As I waited, I have to tell you,
rather disappointed upon my breakfast.

51
00:05:15,817 --> 00:05:18,044
Difficulty with the eggs.
You don't need to know this.

52
00:05:18,307 --> 00:05:21,553
A man who is paid lavishly
to keep order in Jerusalem.

53
00:05:21,809 --> 00:05:25,838
I mean, of course, the
Chief Inspector of the Police.

54
00:05:26,236 --> 00:05:28,437
A man who does not wish to
lose a well-paid post...

55
00:05:28,706 --> 00:05:32,480
when there is discussion among the
local people of self governance...

56
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:37,530
who does wear boots, and
do I believe now does regret...

57
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,510
inviting me to consult on this case.

58
00:05:40,767 --> 00:05:42,409
How dare you accuse me?

59
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,744
Police sergeant...

60
00:05:44,713 --> 00:05:46,513
Did you search the
office as I asked?

61
00:05:46,825 --> 00:05:47,825
Ah... Yes sir.

62
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,423
And did you find what
I said you might?

63
00:05:50,618 --> 00:05:52,462
Yes sir. Just as you said.

64
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,053
<i>You must deliver that to the, captain.
It'll be the first thing in the morning.</i>

65
00:06:36,077 --> 00:06:37,077
<i>I got it sir.</i>

66
00:06:38,113 --> 00:06:40,366
Luggage is on board, sir.

67
00:06:41,065 --> 00:06:43,790
I want the right to
escort you to your boat.

68
00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:50,115
To Istanbul, then?
Will you be back to London straight off?

69
00:06:51,056 --> 00:06:55,715
I'm tired, and I've
earned myself a little holiday.

70
00:06:55,945 --> 00:06:59,617
I want to look at paintings
and have too much time on my hands.

71
00:07:01,249 --> 00:07:02,789
You're staring. Does it stop?

72
00:07:03,774 --> 00:07:05,288
It's just...

73
00:07:05,542 --> 00:07:09,121
How did you know it was him, sir?
From just a tiny crack on the wall.

74
00:07:09,385 --> 00:07:11,750
I have the advantage...

75
00:07:11,996 --> 00:07:14,644
I can only see the
world as it should be.

76
00:07:14,978 --> 00:07:17,593
And when it is not,
the imperfection stands out...

77
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,859
Like the nose in the
middle of a face.

78
00:07:22,729 --> 00:07:25,046
It makes most of life unbearable.

79
00:07:25,276 --> 00:07:29,438
But it is useful in the
detection of crime.

80
00:07:29,742 --> 00:07:34,024
But it's just like you see 'em through their
hearts. And divine their true natures.

81
00:07:34,249 --> 00:07:39,337
And whatever people say, there
is right there is wrong.

82
00:07:39,576 --> 00:07:41,058
There is nothing in between.

83
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,120
We must part here.

84
00:07:45,408 --> 00:07:47,088
No, sir, I am to escort you on ferry.

85
00:07:49,127 --> 00:07:50,731
We must never meet again.

86
00:07:50,902 --> 00:07:52,942
Could you straighten your tie please?
Just a little.

87
00:07:52,969 --> 00:07:54,543
- Yes
- That is perfect.

88
00:07:57,004 --> 00:07:58,595
<i>Final passengers, please!</i>

89
00:08:00,866 --> 00:08:02,019
I am sorry.

90
00:08:03,922 --> 00:08:05,810
<i>We'll be reached soon.</i>

91
00:08:06,077 --> 00:08:07,437
But... Will it be fixed in time?

92
00:08:07,564 --> 00:08:08,564
<i>We are working!</i>

93
00:08:08,712 --> 00:08:12,960
I have a connection in Istanbul.
Leaves tomorrow at seven.

94
00:08:13,152 --> 00:08:16,352
There is a very ill patient
waiting for me in London.

95
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:19,181
I'm a doctor.

96
00:08:20,808 --> 00:08:21,955
<i>Doctor.</i>

97
00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:24,357
<i>I am a doctor.</i>

98
00:08:25,532 --> 00:08:30,694
I am shouting it you in English and
now I am doing it louder and slower.

99
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:32,520
Very silly, forgive me.

100
00:08:33,752 --> 00:08:36,360
May I help?
Let me help.

101
00:08:37,795 --> 00:08:39,847
I know your mustache.

102
00:08:40,106 --> 00:08:44,122
From the papers.
You are the detective Hercules Poirot?

103
00:08:44,669 --> 00:08:48,871
"Hercule Poirot. I do not slay
the lions, Mademoiselle."

104
00:08:51,033 --> 00:08:54,068
Mary Debenham monsieur. I will
forget a name, but never a face.

105
00:08:54,313 --> 00:08:56,126
Not yours, any way.

106
00:08:56,424 --> 00:08:57,562
You come from Baghdad?

107
00:08:59,112 --> 00:09:02,184
It's true.
No detail escapes his notice.

108
00:09:02,472 --> 00:09:03,578
Your ticket.

109
00:09:05,841 --> 00:09:08,001
I might also ask you if you
enjoyed your time there...

110
00:09:08,136 --> 00:09:09,326
as a governess.

111
00:09:10,064 --> 00:09:12,968
The chalk on your sleeve
and the Geography primar.

112
00:09:13,176 --> 00:09:17,423
A governess or a cartographer.
I made my gamble.

113
00:09:19,512 --> 00:09:20,992
I always begin them with Geography...

114
00:09:21,096 --> 00:09:23,336
and monster them until they
have the world down cold.

115
00:09:23,467 --> 00:09:25,416
They may get lost in life...

116
00:09:25,704 --> 00:09:27,824
but I'll be damned if they
don't know where they are.

117
00:09:29,757 --> 00:09:33,466
Well our chains are free.
Right on time.

118
00:09:48,203 --> 00:09:50,600
I feel so free out here in the water.

119
00:09:50,855 --> 00:09:52,691
I wish I could enjoy it.

120
00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:56,509
- You should be out of this, Mary.
- Not now.

121
00:09:57,576 --> 00:09:59,453
When it's all over.

122
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,067
When it's done.

123
00:10:01,232 --> 00:10:03,384
Then nothing can touch us.

124
00:10:24,225 --> 00:10:26,990
<i>Istanbul</i>

125
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:35,611
<i>My holiday begins here.</i>

126
00:10:36,124 --> 00:10:40,448
<i>I can see the soul of the
city in these humble breads.</i>

127
00:10:40,764 --> 00:10:44,150
The world insists on
destruction, yet here...

128
00:10:44,265 --> 00:10:47,847
masterpieces are baked
to order every day.

129
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,187
Mohammed!

130
00:10:53,669 --> 00:10:54,669
Mohammed, my friend...

131
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,792
You are an artist.

132
00:10:57,078 --> 00:10:58,668
My friend!

133
00:10:58,887 --> 00:11:00,264
I am sorry.

134
00:11:00,552 --> 00:11:02,038
Hey, come, come.

135
00:11:02,358 --> 00:11:04,943
Don't mind us, we're just looking
for a place to have a private argument.

136
00:11:04,967 --> 00:11:06,567
It will take some twenty minutes, or so.

137
00:11:06,647 --> 00:11:09,137
I wish then we'll both come to an
agreement. Or at least I will, yes.

138
00:11:09,161 --> 00:11:10,266
Monsieur Bouc!

139
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:12,794
Poirot! In the kitchen.

140
00:11:13,061 --> 00:11:16,421
Well, of course, this man will sniff out the
perfect pastry faster than he catches...

141
00:11:16,535 --> 00:11:17,535
a jewel thief.

142
00:11:19,175 --> 00:11:23,591
No, I am no longer a police man, I can't
bail you out when they've got you badly.

143
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:25,722
This is my dear old friend,
the esteemed...

144
00:11:25,992 --> 00:11:29,024
Poirot, whom I knew before the esteem.
Hercule Poirot, this is...

145
00:11:29,025 --> 00:11:30,065
- A prostitute.
- She is.

146
00:11:30,163 --> 00:11:32,523
I am. Bouc, you did not tell me
you had such famous friends.

147
00:11:32,731 --> 00:11:34,652
We are friends because I
am the only person...

148
00:11:34,823 --> 00:11:37,468
who never asks him any questions about
his cases, because I don't care.

149
00:11:37,492 --> 00:11:39,263
And he never judges me for
being a terrible person.

150
00:11:39,287 --> 00:11:40,287
Indeed you are.

151
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,850
Madame, Bouc, please join me
for a drink, yes?

152
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,274
You only have me for an hour.

153
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:47,927
I ride on the Orient Express at seven.
Official director business.

154
00:11:48,198 --> 00:11:51,023
Uncle pays me absurdly to stay
on board his gorgeous train...

155
00:11:51,237 --> 00:11:52,287
and far away from him...

156
00:11:52,506 --> 00:11:53,506
at the home office...

157
00:11:53,709 --> 00:11:56,313
Consigned to wine and
dine in handsome...

158
00:11:56,562 --> 00:11:57,802
There is an art to nepotism.

159
00:11:57,904 --> 00:11:59,650
And you are his Michelangelo!

160
00:11:59,932 --> 00:12:00,932
Mr. Poirot.

161
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:02,047
Are you a prostitute as well?

162
00:12:02,071 --> 00:12:04,319
- Certainly not.
- Is this man bothering you?

163
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:05,769
He is about to it.

164
00:12:05,927 --> 00:12:07,847
- You are from the British consulate.
- I am sir.

165
00:12:07,986 --> 00:12:09,026
It is the Kassner case.

166
00:12:09,613 --> 00:12:10,829
Why, yes.

167
00:12:11,017 --> 00:12:12,548
I was correct in certain predictions?

168
00:12:13,164 --> 00:12:14,663
Quite.

169
00:12:15,051 --> 00:12:16,343
I do not need to read the telegram.

170
00:12:16,367 --> 00:12:17,367
How fun...

171
00:12:17,543 --> 00:12:18,851
did someone cheat or die?

172
00:12:19,093 --> 00:12:20,589
Unfortunately, both.

173
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:24,314
Someone has...

174
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:27,053
interrupted my longing for rest.

175
00:12:27,239 --> 00:12:29,399
It appears that I must travel
with you tonight, Bouc.

176
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,450
Can you find me a cabin
on the Orient Express?

177
00:12:31,644 --> 00:12:32,644
My friend...

178
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:35,859
I may not begin for much, but I sure as
hell can get you a bed on my train...

179
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:37,600
in the dead of winter. In three days...

180
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:41,266
free of care, concern, or crime.
You will love it.

181
00:12:41,502 --> 00:12:43,899
Mademoiselle, it has been a pleasure.

182
00:12:44,653 --> 00:12:47,768
Your luggage has been collected
and your expenses paid.

183
00:12:48,094 --> 00:12:49,701
You will be next at Calais...

184
00:12:49,939 --> 00:12:54,405
and then escorted to Dover, and
then by rail to London, Victoria.

185
00:12:54,633 --> 00:12:57,049
- I would like to formally express...
- Please don't speak.

186
00:12:57,324 --> 00:12:58,823
You make it worse.

187
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,505
- Here is the tip for you pal.
- Thank you, Mr. Marquez.

188
00:13:07,914 --> 00:13:09,071
I didn't even carry your luggage.

189
00:13:09,095 --> 00:13:10,174
I had a good week.

190
00:13:10,371 --> 00:13:13,637
We celebrate when fortune smiles
, and we share the good fortune.

191
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:15,934
Remember to say nice things about us
Americans, huh?

192
00:13:21,271 --> 00:13:22,292
No!

193
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:23,553
Hey, stop!

194
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,538
For you, Mr. Ratchett,
the best table in the.

195
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,102
Just here, sir.
The very best table.

196
00:13:39,262 --> 00:13:40,827
I want that one.

197
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,635
Hey, Masterman.
You got everything?

198
00:13:48,969 --> 00:13:52,630
Kind of you to inquire, Mr. McQueen.
I do not make mistakes.

199
00:13:55,366 --> 00:13:57,564
Oh my goodness! It's Count Andrenyi.

200
00:13:57,751 --> 00:13:58,847
Come come come.

201
00:13:59,063 --> 00:14:03,450
I saw you dance at Monte Cristo.
Could I take your photograph?

202
00:14:12,502 --> 00:14:13,989
Please, not in my face, no!

203
00:14:36,367 --> 00:14:37,693
Sorry.

204
00:14:47,612 --> 00:14:50,027
The Orient Express!

205
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:53,658
With stops in Sofia, Nis,
Belgrade, Vinkovci and Brod...

206
00:14:53,925 --> 00:14:57,573
with transfers to Bucharest, Zagreb,
Trieste, Venice, Milan, Lausanne...

207
00:14:57,841 --> 00:14:59,902
Dijon, Paris, Bologna and Calais...

208
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,646
with connection to Dover and
London, leaves in fifteen minutes!

209
00:15:02,821 --> 00:15:06,378
This way, Michel! Precious cargo
I need a first class compartment.

210
00:15:06,694 --> 00:15:09,894
Give special care to my friend, Michel.
I want him pampered like a zoo panda.

211
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,195
But Monsieur Bouc, we are fully booked.
There is no place left.

212
00:15:12,219 --> 00:15:13,996
Then we make space.
You can have the no. 11.

213
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:16,087
The eleven is always kept
open for official use.

214
00:15:16,142 --> 00:15:17,209
It's very comfortable.

215
00:15:17,465 --> 00:15:19,705
11 is taken. The Austrian
professor booked it 2 days ago.

216
00:15:19,865 --> 00:15:22,185
There is not 1 first class
sleeper car in the whole train?

217
00:15:22,252 --> 00:15:23,252
Negative, sir.

218
00:15:23,371 --> 00:15:24,322
Second class?

219
00:15:24,343 --> 00:15:25,453
There is no place left at all.

220
00:15:25,477 --> 00:15:27,055
Mademoiselle Debenham.

221
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:28,935
Mr. Poirot, are you joining us?

222
00:15:29,251 --> 00:15:31,006
It depends who wins this debate.

223
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:32,643
Have all the passengers arrived?

224
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,182
All but one. Mr. Harris.

225
00:15:35,398 --> 00:15:38,758
"All passengers must check in at least one
half hours prior it's time of departure...

226
00:15:38,865 --> 00:15:40,344
"or their seat may be forfeit".

227
00:15:40,558 --> 00:15:42,862
The half hour has passed.
The seat is forfeit.

228
00:15:43,132 --> 00:15:46,946
Please take Monsieur Poirot's luggage to
number three, with Mr. McQueen.

229
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,081
Enjoy.

230
00:15:49,317 --> 00:15:50,317
- Welcome Sir.
- Yes.

231
00:15:53,445 --> 00:15:55,762
Number three is unlucky.

232
00:15:59,302 --> 00:16:01,474
Apologies, madame.
I meant no disrespect to you.

233
00:16:01,798 --> 00:16:03,468
Oh, you could try to mean a little..

234
00:16:05,326 --> 00:16:09,155
One thing about train travel
you're always knocking into somebody.

235
00:16:09,367 --> 00:16:10,367
It is wonderful.

236
00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:12,775
Although I am looking
always to getting back.

237
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,813
Travel is my
spicy food, mosques, meeting men...

238
00:16:16,024 --> 00:16:19,198
eventually just miss your own bed.

239
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,764
I have been accused of
husband hunting abroad.

240
00:16:28,048 --> 00:16:31,846
And I can't honestly deny it,.
I like my time alone, I do.

241
00:16:31,985 --> 00:16:36,614
But a lady has certain needs that deserve
to be met, if she has any money...

242
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,020
and preferably, on a regular basis.

243
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:45,275
Oh my! Fire in the kitchen!

244
00:16:45,501 --> 00:16:46,501
<i>See you later, Madame!</i>

245
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,333
Good evening.

246
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:52,113
Number nine.

247
00:16:52,442 --> 00:16:53,442
Good evening.

248
00:16:54,228 --> 00:16:55,741
How you doing?

249
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:59,012
No, after you.

250
00:17:02,297 --> 00:17:03,518
<i>Ah, number three.</i>

251
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:06,501
Who is it? Ah, Mr. McQueen?

252
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:08,421
Yeah. I think you might
have the wrong birth.

253
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:12,099
<i>Excuse me, is there a problem, sir?</i>

254
00:17:12,528 --> 00:17:13,636
<i>No problem.</i>

255
00:17:13,937 --> 00:17:15,097
The train is full.

256
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,780
And I think that we are,
how do you say? "Bunkies".

257
00:17:21,477 --> 00:17:22,477
Really?

258
00:17:22,725 --> 00:17:25,245
I am equally disappointed in you.
This is nice.

259
00:17:33,914 --> 00:17:35,340
Come along, darlings.

260
00:18:01,142 --> 00:18:02,157
No.

261
00:18:05,963 --> 00:18:06,979
No.

262
00:18:08,633 --> 00:18:09,633
This?

263
00:18:13,072 --> 00:18:15,261
Why my... unpacked?

264
00:18:17,252 --> 00:18:20,783
<i>Final call for passengers!</i>

265
00:18:29,423 --> 00:18:31,045
Shall we brush it?

266
00:18:31,292 --> 00:18:33,932
What the hell is taking them so long?

267
00:18:34,108 --> 00:18:35,832
Soon as we're getting out of
here, have them make up the bed.

268
00:18:35,856 --> 00:18:37,125
It's already fixed, Mr. Ratchett.

269
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:40,642
No, I want the bed made.
And bring my Dictaphone.

270
00:18:40,921 --> 00:18:42,729
Dogs on the table. It's
the most disgust-able

271
00:18:42,929 --> 00:18:44,285
thing I've ever seen in a while.

272
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,138
- Yes sir.
- I want you to get McQueen...

273
00:18:46,173 --> 00:18:48,479
And have him bring every
receipt from the Milan sale.

274
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:50,156
- I want you to get it done.
- Yes sir.

275
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,524
I want you to get it done now.

276
00:18:56,238 --> 00:18:58,532
- Did I say get it done now?
- Right away sir.

277
00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:58,778
<i>Better watch yourself.</i>

278
00:20:00,543 --> 00:20:02,263
Your coffee, Mr. Ratchett.

279
00:20:05,751 --> 00:20:06,884
Who did this?

280
00:20:07,034 --> 00:20:08,758
I can't say, sir.

281
00:20:20,271 --> 00:20:21,596
Good evening, Mrs. Hubbard.

282
00:20:21,769 --> 00:20:23,132
Hello, Mr. Masterman.

283
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:40,722
Well, hello.

284
00:20:42,836 --> 00:20:45,409
Eyes linger any longer, I'll
have to charge rent.

285
00:20:46,135 --> 00:20:47,575
I'll pay.

286
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,347
Have another drink.

287
00:20:52,171 --> 00:20:54,057
Are you insulted?

288
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,733
Disappointed.

289
00:20:56,515 --> 00:20:59,093
Some men have a good look.

290
00:20:59,381 --> 00:21:00,962
All they have to do is...

291
00:21:01,233 --> 00:21:04,220
keep their mouth shut, and
they can take on any prize they want.

292
00:21:06,527 --> 00:21:09,405
Still, the mouth opens.

293
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,432
Is everything alright, Mrs. Hubbard?

294
00:21:26,659 --> 00:21:29,475
You have a strong intuition, I know.

295
00:21:31,593 --> 00:21:33,731
My second husband used to say just so.

296
00:21:34,566 --> 00:21:37,271
Hold that, he was my first.

297
00:21:37,665 --> 00:21:38,572
Yeah.

298
00:21:38,607 --> 00:21:40,268
Brightest man I've ever met.

299
00:21:40,495 --> 00:21:43,434
Face like a turnip, but
I loved that turnip.

300
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:46,143
It was nice to talk.

301
00:21:47,742 --> 00:21:48,742
<i>Excuse me.</i>

302
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:54,623
Goodnight.

303
00:22:11,385 --> 00:22:13,997
<i>Mr. Poirot breakfast.</i>

304
00:22:18,259 --> 00:22:19,259
When you take supper...

305
00:22:19,422 --> 00:22:21,139
I'll move Mr. McQueen to
Monsieur Bouc's compartment.

306
00:22:21,163 --> 00:22:23,163
You will travel first class, monsieur.

307
00:22:28,297 --> 00:22:29,911
<i>- Bon apetite.
- And the eggs?</i>

308
00:22:51,811 --> 00:22:53,051
Good afternoon.

309
00:22:53,211 --> 00:22:54,359
Ah, Mrs. Hubbard.

310
00:22:54,614 --> 00:22:55,835
Good afternoon.

311
00:22:57,432 --> 00:22:58,466
There we are.

312
00:22:58,761 --> 00:23:01,980
- Complements of the Orient Express.
- Thank you, Mr. Bouc.

313
00:23:02,274 --> 00:23:05,232
I am here for all of your needs.

314
00:23:05,465 --> 00:23:06,670
No thank you. I do not drink.

315
00:23:06,907 --> 00:23:09,033
I do not agree with you.

316
00:23:09,283 --> 00:23:11,757
Sin doesn't agree with me.

317
00:23:12,086 --> 00:23:15,021
Vice is where the devil
finds his darlings.

318
00:23:15,314 --> 00:23:16,405
We should no longer speak.

319
00:23:19,074 --> 00:23:20,605
Good afternoon.

320
00:23:20,822 --> 00:23:25,076
Monsieur, how about an appetizer?

321
00:23:25,361 --> 00:23:28,889
I regret I have an appointment
with the director of the train.

322
00:23:29,154 --> 00:23:31,430
He was gonna leave anyway.

323
00:23:31,656 --> 00:23:32,656
Please sir.

324
00:23:37,603 --> 00:23:39,042
All settled in?

325
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,859
As advertised.

326
00:23:43,076 --> 00:23:46,699
And yet, the best things
on the train are not food.

327
00:23:50,009 --> 00:23:51,210
You know? There is something about a...

328
00:23:51,234 --> 00:23:54,196
a tangle of strangers pressed together
for days, with nothing in common...

329
00:23:54,455 --> 00:23:56,375
but they need to go from
one place to another...

330
00:23:56,533 --> 00:23:58,484
and never see each other again.

331
00:23:58,699 --> 00:24:00,640
Boredom, plus anonymity, plus...

332
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:02,768
constant gentle rocking.

333
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:06,292
With your hobbies, you'll
never amount to anything.

334
00:24:06,523 --> 00:24:07,843
God I hope so.

335
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:10,320
Oh give me the fish.

336
00:24:12,854 --> 00:24:17,650
Exchange grouper for soul,
Es Carole for the potato, and...

337
00:24:18,615 --> 00:24:19,975
the beef sauce for the veloutÃ(Copyright).

338
00:24:22,968 --> 00:24:24,728
Garcon, that sounds superb.
The same for me.

339
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:28,482
The princess Dragomiroff.

340
00:24:29,288 --> 00:24:32,488
You know, if I had the word to marry for
money I would marry for that much money.

341
00:24:33,642 --> 00:24:34,802
I brushed Dalia this morning.

342
00:24:35,048 --> 00:24:37,373
No, you tortured my darling doggy.

343
00:24:37,655 --> 00:24:38,764
<i>I asked you to brush her.</i>

344
00:24:38,996 --> 00:24:40,938
You still enjoying your Dickens?

345
00:24:41,272 --> 00:24:42,830
Very much, Mon'Amie.

346
00:24:43,214 --> 00:24:46,645
You know, with your books and your capers,
you're missing out on romance.

347
00:24:47,831 --> 00:24:50,029
The romance never goes unpunished.

348
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:52,045
There was...

349
00:24:55,092 --> 00:24:57,669
There was someone once.

350
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:12,344
I would prefer into future I
to be sit not with that man.

351
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:16,640
Like should be seated with like.
We are not alike.

352
00:25:17,925 --> 00:25:21,578
Not all of us are so concerned with
the separation of races, professor.

353
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:26,361
It is out of respect for all kinds
that I prefer to keep them separated.

354
00:25:26,586 --> 00:25:31,414
To mix your red wine and the
white, would be to ruin them both.

355
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,207
I like a good rose.

356
00:26:22,073 --> 00:26:23,821
Hey, how you doing?
Would you mind...

357
00:26:24,145 --> 00:26:25,357
if I join you?

358
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,649
Dessert is an indulgence...

359
00:26:28,946 --> 00:26:32,626
and I feel kind of silly
stupid, indulging alone.

360
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,168
I am at my happiest alone.

361
00:26:35,954 --> 00:26:36,989
But...

362
00:26:37,314 --> 00:26:40,943
For a piece of your
fragility, pleased to join you.

363
00:26:41,174 --> 00:26:44,333
Oh my. Excuse me, another fork.

364
00:26:47,048 --> 00:26:49,046
I have been trying to
make your acquit Mr. Poirot.

365
00:26:50,649 --> 00:26:54,156
I never ever sat so
close to fame before me.

366
00:26:54,436 --> 00:26:56,345
Now I tell a lie.

367
00:26:56,561 --> 00:26:59,201
Once I was in a bus with Ty Cobb.

368
00:27:00,665 --> 00:27:02,262
Ball player, Detroit.

369
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:08,121
Would you mind if I have the little
curly bit at the top?

370
00:27:08,412 --> 00:27:10,471
You are not a bird though?

371
00:27:11,542 --> 00:27:13,529
A strange peculiar man.

372
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:16,726
I am of a age where I know what I like
and what I do not like.

373
00:27:16,975 --> 00:27:22,048
What I like, I enjoy enormously.
What I dislike, I can not abide.

374
00:27:22,361 --> 00:27:24,803
For an instance,
the temporary pleasantries before

375
00:27:25,003 --> 00:27:27,395
what is determined to be
a business discussion.

376
00:27:28,097 --> 00:27:29,379
You're fun.

377
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:31,730
All right.

378
00:27:32,825 --> 00:27:34,891
I would like to offer you a job.

379
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:39,785
"The avenger of the innocents".
That's what they call you in the papers.

380
00:27:40,054 --> 00:27:41,302
You are an innocent?

381
00:27:41,523 --> 00:27:42,939
I am a businessman.

382
00:27:43,222 --> 00:27:47,733
I am an art dealer.
I mean, I am new to it.

383
00:27:48,007 --> 00:27:50,684
But my beginner's luck
has worked out.

384
00:27:51,597 --> 00:27:52,902
Relics, antiquities.

385
00:27:53,265 --> 00:27:56,270
Rugs, rare. Orientals.

386
00:27:57,281 --> 00:28:01,362
I'm new to the game, so, you
know, I got the amateur eye ball.

387
00:28:01,656 --> 00:28:05,186
But I got a little problem with the...

388
00:28:05,439 --> 00:28:07,427
so called praises.

389
00:28:07,624 --> 00:28:09,473
You can't trust a one.

390
00:28:11,671 --> 00:28:13,328
Some of my customers...

391
00:28:14,465 --> 00:28:15,665
They buy a piece...

392
00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:19,649
They find out they are
not exactly original...

393
00:28:19,879 --> 00:28:21,121
which is not really my fault...

394
00:28:21,343 --> 00:28:24,756
if a Kashan silk scarf is a fake.

395
00:28:25,025 --> 00:28:26,025
Right?

396
00:28:29,636 --> 00:28:31,964
But I've managed to make
a few enemies, it's the thing.

397
00:28:32,245 --> 00:28:35,274
Got a few letters,
people making threats.

398
00:28:36,266 --> 00:28:38,614
And most likely it's the Italians.

399
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:43,162
I sold them a set of
Oriental carpets in Milan.

400
00:28:44,417 --> 00:28:47,926
And the buyers weren't so happy
with the providence.

401
00:28:49,241 --> 00:28:51,994
And they want their money
back with interest, you know?

402
00:28:52,241 --> 00:28:53,241
Italians.

403
00:28:53,826 --> 00:28:55,048
A guinea is guinea.

404
00:28:56,128 --> 00:28:59,415
And then comes along
the genius detective.

405
00:28:59,667 --> 00:29:00,832
Me?

406
00:29:01,024 --> 00:29:04,196
- Yes you. Hercules Poirot.
- Hercule.

407
00:29:07,672 --> 00:29:08,872
Here is what I'd like to do.

408
00:29:09,089 --> 00:29:11,872
I would like to hire you
to watch my back...

409
00:29:12,214 --> 00:29:14,100
until I get someplace safe.

410
00:29:15,362 --> 00:29:17,444
It's easy money for you.

411
00:29:17,685 --> 00:29:19,394
And it's peace of mind
for me, you know?

412
00:29:19,668 --> 00:29:21,138
- I understand.
- Good.

413
00:29:21,391 --> 00:29:22,323
I refuse.

414
00:29:22,389 --> 00:29:24,203
That's bad.

415
00:29:25,504 --> 00:29:28,466
I didn't make
myself clear enough.

416
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:32,585
You see, someone is out to get me.

417
00:29:32,786 --> 00:29:36,377
And I know I'm not the best...
Not by a long shot.

418
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,485
And if there is a world after this, where I
will face judgment, just like you.

419
00:29:40,748 --> 00:29:41,748
But...

420
00:29:44,009 --> 00:29:47,080
I ain't in no goddamn rush to do it.

421
00:29:47,662 --> 00:29:49,356
- You are holding a gun at me?
- No.

422
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:52,024
Not you. On the world.

423
00:29:52,327 --> 00:29:54,424
I exist in the world.
Do not point the gun at me.

424
00:29:54,795 --> 00:29:56,355
How does ten thousand sound for a week?

425
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:58,550
It's a generous offer Mr Rachette.
I must decline.

426
00:29:58,648 --> 00:30:00,728
- Fifteen thousand?
- You didn't hear me, I declined.

427
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:02,184
Oh, I get it.

428
00:30:03,171 --> 00:30:07,715
It's not flashing out for the
great Hercules Poirot. Huh?

429
00:30:07,936 --> 00:30:08,936
Not new flash-books...

430
00:30:09,084 --> 00:30:11,604
You sell fakes to gangsters.
You're suffering the consequences.

431
00:30:11,867 --> 00:30:13,827
I detect criminals.
I do not protect them.

432
00:30:15,384 --> 00:30:17,320
So you are saying no
to my dirty money.

433
00:30:17,575 --> 00:30:19,264
I say no to you, Mr. Ratchett.

434
00:30:20,394 --> 00:30:22,408
Business with the gun, right?
Is that what it was?

435
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,689
This is far more personal than that.

436
00:30:26,502 --> 00:30:28,288
I do not like your face.

437
00:30:30,803 --> 00:30:32,497
If you'll excuse me...

438
00:30:33,744 --> 00:30:35,584
You liked my cake, didn't ya?

439
00:30:35,761 --> 00:30:39,423
The cake was excellent.
Have a pleasant afternoon, Mr. Ratchett.

440
00:31:02,948 --> 00:31:04,244
Thank you.

441
00:31:06,143 --> 00:31:07,236
<i>How cold.</i>

442
00:31:27,121 --> 00:31:29,343
Mossier Katherine.

443
00:31:31,026 --> 00:31:32,803
Mon'Amie.

444
00:31:43,122 --> 00:31:44,633
Mr. Dickens.

445
00:31:58,676 --> 00:31:59,887
Mr. Ratchett?

446
00:32:07,743 --> 00:32:08,743
Mr. Ratchett?

447
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,862
Yeah, mossier.
Goodnight.

448
00:32:34,575 --> 00:32:35,575
Mrs. Hubbard?

449
00:32:35,607 --> 00:32:37,260
It's always Mrs. Hubbard.

450
00:32:37,584 --> 00:32:38,935
Mrs. Hubbard.

451
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,063
Did we die?

452
00:33:33,332 --> 00:33:35,889
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the train has been derailed.</i>

453
00:33:36,562 --> 00:33:37,906
<i>You alright, Mr. Marquez?</i>

454
00:33:38,174 --> 00:33:40,805
<i>I'm fine. Thank you.</i>

455
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,319
<i>Mr. Bouc will speak to you...</i>

456
00:33:44,977 --> 00:33:46,093
<i>All clear.</i>

457
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:48,093
<i>Are we going to die?</i>

458
00:33:56,198 --> 00:33:57,914
<i>My Katherine.</i>

459
00:34:00,202 --> 00:34:02,040
My beautiful...

460
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:47,892
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid that
our train is still unable to go anywhere.

461
00:34:48,076 --> 00:34:49,079
Yeah, except down.

462
00:34:49,335 --> 00:34:50,935
How long are we supposed to just figure?

463
00:34:50,981 --> 00:34:53,150
Yes, someone must be doing something.

464
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:56,150
Of course I'm doing something.
I am doing nothing.

465
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:58,573
<i>Precisely two hours and ten minutes ago,</i>

466
00:34:58,673 --> 00:35:00,638
<i>when we didn't arrive in
Broad as scheduled...</i>

467
00:35:00,878 --> 00:35:02,978
<i>The station master will have
surmised our situation...</i>

468
00:35:03,002 --> 00:35:05,534
<i>and already sent a team
to excavate the engine...</i>

469
00:35:05,745 --> 00:35:07,838
<i>clear our path and send us on our way.</i>

470
00:35:08,054 --> 00:35:09,311
<i>Until then, I assure you...</i>

471
00:35:09,335 --> 00:35:12,530
we will all be made warm,
and, fed and comfortable.

472
00:35:13,286 --> 00:35:14,367
We could walk.

473
00:35:14,535 --> 00:35:16,954
We could die of exposure trying.

474
00:35:17,246 --> 00:35:18,969
I have a connection to make.

475
00:35:19,166 --> 00:35:21,893
My boat sails the day after
tomorrow, from France.

476
00:35:22,377 --> 00:35:25,487
Without you, I would wedger.
Or me in London.

477
00:35:25,733 --> 00:35:29,010
I hold you accountable for
my loss of time, Mr. Bouc.

478
00:35:29,046 --> 00:35:30,960
Madame, you can't hold me
accountable for the weather.

479
00:35:30,984 --> 00:35:32,860
Of course, I can.
You are the one here.

480
00:35:32,939 --> 00:35:35,104
And my conference in Turin?

481
00:35:35,137 --> 00:35:37,402
And I was to meet a
factory in Sochaux.

482
00:35:37,981 --> 00:35:40,146
Yes, some things...
They are in God's hands.

483
00:35:40,814 --> 00:35:42,691
It is not for us to say..

484
00:35:42,867 --> 00:35:46,085
If we deserve to arrive
safely to our destination...

485
00:35:47,484 --> 00:35:50,840
or if, like Lucifer,
we must fall.

486
00:36:01,508 --> 00:36:03,806
Breakfast for you, Mr. Ratchett!

487
00:36:05,289 --> 00:36:06,954
Ah. Bonjour, Mr. Masterman.

488
00:36:08,688 --> 00:36:09,877
There is problem?

489
00:36:10,151 --> 00:36:11,403
I can't say, sir.

490
00:36:11,717 --> 00:36:13,070
Mr. Ratchett?

491
00:36:26,705 --> 00:36:28,045
That is cold air.

492
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:32,009
Please bring Mr. Bouc immediately,
and also Dr. Arbuthnot.

493
00:36:51,926 --> 00:36:53,439
Good god.

494
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:55,934
Touch nothing else,
only the body.

495
00:36:59,372 --> 00:37:01,273
By God, this is horrible.

496
00:37:01,501 --> 00:37:03,805
First the snow and now...

497
00:37:04,059 --> 00:37:06,988
I'll have to meet with the police and
make some statement in some grimy station.

498
00:37:07,012 --> 00:37:08,949
And a man has died.

499
00:37:09,876 --> 00:37:11,248
And a man has died.

500
00:37:11,405 --> 00:37:13,375
He was stabbed.

501
00:37:13,629 --> 00:37:14,629
Long straight edge knife.

502
00:37:14,864 --> 00:37:17,918
Multiple stab wounds, some shallow
some cut clean through muscle.

503
00:37:18,089 --> 00:37:19,449
Left hand side or right hand side?

504
00:37:19,633 --> 00:37:21,119
That's the thing.

505
00:37:21,412 --> 00:37:25,429
It appears that the killer maybe
closed his eyes and struck blind.

506
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:28,868
Could you estimate the time of death?

507
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:31,320
It's hard to say
with the window opened...

508
00:37:31,488 --> 00:37:34,261
but my best guess is
between midnight and 2:00.

509
00:37:34,408 --> 00:37:36,883
But no one went to his compartment.
And I sat on my seat all night.

510
00:37:36,907 --> 00:37:39,757
I would have seen if someone came,
It's impossible.

511
00:37:41,437 --> 00:37:43,326
Thank you Doctor.
Please return to the dining car.

512
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:45,180
Michel, secure this carriage.

513
00:37:47,428 --> 00:37:48,657
Poirot.

514
00:37:51,891 --> 00:37:53,678
I need your help, my friend.

515
00:37:57,064 --> 00:37:58,312
You have to find who did this.

516
00:37:58,593 --> 00:38:01,261
Please, I employ you on behalf
of the Orient Express.

517
00:38:01,405 --> 00:38:03,512
When the police arrives we can
present them with a case closed.

518
00:38:03,536 --> 00:38:05,397
You are the only one who can save me.

519
00:38:05,674 --> 00:38:09,349
Your faith touches me, Mon Cher.
But I must held this rest.

520
00:38:09,661 --> 00:38:12,521
Well, think of it as a little
beach time puzzle.

521
00:38:12,733 --> 00:38:14,422
That's nothing to your mind!

522
00:38:14,677 --> 00:38:16,626
You look up the antecedents
of the passengers.

523
00:38:16,885 --> 00:38:19,952
You will establish the Boniface
And then do what you do.

524
00:38:20,221 --> 00:38:24,437
You sit in a chair
and you eat your cake...

525
00:38:24,633 --> 00:38:26,633
and you think, until the
solution present itself.

526
00:38:26,864 --> 00:38:28,693
What else are you going to do
while we sit here in the snow?

527
00:38:28,717 --> 00:38:31,352
Without constant stimulation,
your little Grey cells will starve and die.

528
00:38:31,376 --> 00:38:32,713
Do you think that is what I do?
I sit in the chair...

529
00:38:32,737 --> 00:38:35,029
I have a little piece of cake
and then I come up with a..

530
00:38:35,053 --> 00:38:36,459
- I don't know what are you do.
- I have my Dickens.

531
00:38:36,483 --> 00:38:37,874
Damn your Dickens!

532
00:38:38,845 --> 00:38:41,245
If we leave this to the police,
they will choose a culprit...

533
00:38:41,283 --> 00:38:43,255
Right or wrong, and
then they'll hang him.

534
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,600
Most probably Mr. Marquez...

535
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:46,735
for no other reason, than
his name is Marquez.

536
00:38:46,981 --> 00:38:49,366
Or Dr. Arbuthnot, for
the color of his skin.

537
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:57,610
You are the only one
who can bring justice.

538
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:02,725
- Let me have a map of this coach.
- Of course.

539
00:39:02,787 --> 00:39:03,877
- Every passport.
- Anything.

540
00:39:03,901 --> 00:39:05,781
Interviews arranged with
all of the passengers.

541
00:39:05,821 --> 00:39:08,768
Evidence, order and method,
until one culprit emerges.

542
00:39:08,914 --> 00:39:10,619
I do not approve of
murder, my friend.

543
00:39:10,826 --> 00:39:12,919
Every day we meet people the world
could have better without yet...

544
00:39:12,943 --> 00:39:14,109
we do not kill them.

545
00:39:14,357 --> 00:39:16,717
We must be better than the beasts.

546
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:20,835
So let us find this killer.

547
00:39:24,977 --> 00:39:27,590
Ladies and gentlemen,
allow me to...

548
00:39:27,849 --> 00:39:30,328
It appears that, our
bad luck has worsened.

549
00:39:30,541 --> 00:39:31,541
That is...

550
00:39:31,676 --> 00:39:34,452
A passenger has
died on the train.

551
00:39:34,716 --> 00:39:36,081
Monsieur Ratchett.

552
00:39:45,153 --> 00:39:46,594
Looks like they got him after all.

553
00:39:46,836 --> 00:39:48,608
Do you assume he was killed?

554
00:39:48,867 --> 00:39:50,376
No, no.

555
00:39:50,514 --> 00:39:53,038
I just meant he was in
perfectly good health.

556
00:39:53,245 --> 00:39:54,589
He had his enemies, that's all.

557
00:39:54,877 --> 00:39:56,671
Indeed he did, he was murdered.

558
00:39:58,305 --> 00:40:01,020
Oh God, a murder here?

559
00:40:01,212 --> 00:40:02,341
Alas, madame.

560
00:40:02,556 --> 00:40:04,210
God rest his soul.

561
00:40:05,288 --> 00:40:08,199
Someone was rummaging around my
cabin in the middle of the night.

562
00:40:08,508 --> 00:40:10,287
Nobody would believe me.

563
00:40:12,468 --> 00:40:13,468
What is going on?

564
00:40:13,548 --> 00:40:15,747
As we are snowbound, I have
elected to take the case...

565
00:40:16,077 --> 00:40:18,435
and find for my friend,
Monsieur Bouc, the criminal.

566
00:40:18,637 --> 00:40:19,992
And why you?

567
00:40:21,277 --> 00:40:23,001
My name is Hercule Poirot...

568
00:40:23,196 --> 00:40:25,692
and I'm probably the greatest
detective in the world.

569
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:28,756
I will speak to all of you in time.
For the moment...

570
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:31,648
I must recommend that you remain in
your compartment with the doors locked.

571
00:40:31,672 --> 00:40:33,179
I feel like a prisoner here.

572
00:40:33,439 --> 00:40:35,723
It is for your own safety.

573
00:40:35,902 --> 00:40:37,810
If there was a murder...

574
00:40:38,076 --> 00:40:39,910
then there was a murderer.

575
00:40:40,956 --> 00:40:42,593
The murderer is with us...

576
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:46,333
on the train, now.

577
00:40:56,657 --> 00:40:59,706
The doors between coaches
were locked at night.. hmm?

578
00:40:59,946 --> 00:41:01,541
Absolutely, done myself.

579
00:41:01,807 --> 00:41:04,217
The train's been searched.
There is no one hiding on it or under it.

580
00:41:04,241 --> 00:41:08,807
We can therefore limit our investigation
to the occupants of the Calais coach.

581
00:41:09,007 --> 00:41:10,812
Bouc, you'll assist me.

582
00:41:11,023 --> 00:41:12,760
As the only traveler who
slept in another coach..

583
00:41:12,784 --> 00:41:14,443
You are the only one
who is not a suspect.

584
00:41:22,923 --> 00:41:26,220
Mr. McQueen, is it
really the time for drinking?

585
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,063
My boss is dead.

586
00:41:28,303 --> 00:41:31,399
I am out of the job, and you're
looking at me like I did it.

587
00:41:31,668 --> 00:41:32,948
We make no accusations.

588
00:41:33,031 --> 00:41:35,500
You knew him, so from you we
need the essential facts.

589
00:41:35,724 --> 00:41:37,462
Were you his relative?

590
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:40,877
No, his secretary.

591
00:41:42,439 --> 00:41:46,402
Booked his travel,
ordered his steaks.

592
00:41:46,728 --> 00:41:49,895
Man ate more steaks than I
have ever seen in my entire life.

593
00:41:50,191 --> 00:41:52,144
He was in antiques.

594
00:41:52,399 --> 00:41:55,412
He had no qualifications for it,
not the eye, quite the languages.

595
00:41:55,644 --> 00:41:58,778
Truth is, he had no head for business,
accounting...

596
00:41:59,052 --> 00:42:00,161
None of it.

597
00:42:00,463 --> 00:42:01,565
I took care of everything.

598
00:42:01,788 --> 00:42:04,144
How long were you in his employ?

599
00:42:04,322 --> 00:42:06,874
Twenty days short of a year.

600
00:42:07,197 --> 00:42:10,619
Prohibition wasn't to my taste...

601
00:42:12,539 --> 00:42:15,331
so I found myself overseas, and in debt.

602
00:42:18,587 --> 00:42:21,042
I'm a lawyer by education...

603
00:42:21,204 --> 00:42:22,849
not disposition.

604
00:42:23,138 --> 00:42:25,068
He was incompetent in that.

605
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,165
You were fond of him?

606
00:42:27,371 --> 00:42:29,488
I was fond of his money.

607
00:42:29,776 --> 00:42:30,776
Ratchett was crude...

608
00:42:31,375 --> 00:42:35,790
<i>demanding, insulting,
and most likely a felon.</i>

609
00:42:36,035 --> 00:42:37,650
<i>When did you last see him?</i>

610
00:42:37,974 --> 00:42:39,677
<i>It must have been just after 10:00.</i>

611
00:42:39,981 --> 00:42:41,862
He called me in to go over
our sales in Italy.

612
00:42:42,107 --> 00:42:44,449
Milan, the sale of forgeries?

613
00:42:44,737 --> 00:42:49,020
Yeah, yeah.
He wanted to look over the accounts.

614
00:42:49,403 --> 00:42:50,895
I had to translate everything else.

615
00:42:51,169 --> 00:42:53,601
The contracts were in French
and he didn't speak a word.

616
00:42:54,516 --> 00:42:55,876
<i>And when we stopped at Vinkovci...</i>

617
00:42:55,969 --> 00:42:58,427
<i>I struck up a chat with
the colored doctor, Arbuthnot.</i>

618
00:42:58,658 --> 00:43:00,618
<i>We had a couple of
drinks, stretch our legs.</i>

619
00:43:00,784 --> 00:43:01,784
<i>He had some...</i>

620
00:43:01,936 --> 00:43:05,378
odd opinions about Stalin
I had to turn around.

621
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,074
I don't hold the man's race against him,
but I don't often take the Britishers.

622
00:43:10,044 --> 00:43:11,440
When did your party end?

623
00:43:11,675 --> 00:43:14,312
Yeah... He left just after 2:00.

624
00:43:14,512 --> 00:43:17,530
Did you know of any specific
enemies Ratchett might have had?

625
00:43:17,773 --> 00:43:18,893
Gosh.

626
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:20,366
Pick a number.

627
00:43:20,699 --> 00:43:23,178
You confide that he have been threatened?

628
00:43:23,387 --> 00:43:25,046
He got a couple of nasty letters.

629
00:43:25,221 --> 00:43:28,283
I have them, if you like.
Some, at least.

630
00:43:28,557 --> 00:43:30,503
He... Threw up the rest.

631
00:43:31,643 --> 00:43:33,252
He threw them into the fire.

632
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:43,620
Merci, Mr. McQueen.

633
00:43:43,931 --> 00:43:44,931
Thank you.

634
00:43:45,011 --> 00:43:47,820
If we have any further questions,
we will call for you again.

635
00:43:51,458 --> 00:43:53,834
Have you consider the Latin man Marquez?

636
00:43:53,934 --> 00:43:55,446
Hell of a guy man.

637
00:43:56,339 --> 00:43:59,668
And, well, you know, his kind...

638
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:03,881
They don't have the same distest
for murder, historically speaking.

639
00:44:04,067 --> 00:44:06,621
You said you don't hold a
man's race against him.

640
00:44:06,899 --> 00:44:07,899
I suppose...

641
00:44:09,236 --> 00:44:11,099
depends on the race.

642
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:18,658
He was doing so well.

643
00:44:18,949 --> 00:44:20,770
- Do you think it's McQueen?
- Too early to say.

644
00:44:20,794 --> 00:44:23,194
I admit, I can't see him
stabbing a man 12 times in a frenzy.

645
00:44:23,248 --> 00:44:24,688
Not sober, any way.
Who did it then?

646
00:44:24,784 --> 00:44:26,224
I do not know yet.
It's time we ask.

647
00:44:26,498 --> 00:44:28,187
- Ask? Who?
- The victim.

648
00:45:02,483 --> 00:45:06,627
He has 12 stab wounds and as
Arbuthnot said they are patternless.

649
00:45:06,918 --> 00:45:07,998
If the doctor is guilty...

650
00:45:08,218 --> 00:45:10,522
He certainly didn't let his
influence his responsibility.

651
00:45:10,738 --> 00:45:12,644
Hey, the watch.
Stopped at 1:15.

652
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,690
That agrees with the the doctor
on the time of death.

653
00:45:14,714 --> 00:45:16,543
It is possible, yes.
Certainly possible.

654
00:45:16,786 --> 00:45:19,035
- I don't quite understand.
- Well, I do not understand myself.

655
00:45:19,059 --> 00:45:20,219
I understand nothing at all.

656
00:45:20,362 --> 00:45:22,150
If you look at these two wounds...

657
00:45:22,349 --> 00:45:25,249
They are powerful and deep,
and yet there is little blood.

658
00:45:25,571 --> 00:45:27,917
But this was a frenzy attack.

659
00:45:28,204 --> 00:45:32,450
Lashing here and there, no pattern
at all, just extreme violence.

660
00:45:32,724 --> 00:45:36,481
And during all this, our victim,
vigorous, and anxious and full of coffee...

661
00:45:36,634 --> 00:45:39,709
merely lies still and accepts
death without struggle...

662
00:45:39,946 --> 00:45:42,457
when he also has here...

663
00:45:42,766 --> 00:45:45,778
the means by which he might
defend himself.

664
00:45:46,615 --> 00:45:48,033
For you.

665
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:50,739
Now, let us see.

666
00:45:53,794 --> 00:45:56,818
Barbital. The mickey sleep.

667
00:45:56,986 --> 00:45:59,135
They drugged him so
he could not use this.

668
00:46:00,555 --> 00:46:02,668
And let her around here
a ladies handkerchief.

669
00:46:02,949 --> 00:46:06,310
An object de luxe, handmade, boom,
two hundred francs in Paris.

670
00:46:06,394 --> 00:46:08,762
And she even has an initial, "H".

671
00:46:09,005 --> 00:46:12,022
- And our little friend, the pipe cleaner.
- Another clue.

672
00:46:12,303 --> 00:46:14,996
Yes, a riot of clues
dropped most conveniently.

673
00:46:15,021 --> 00:46:19,410
Yet only one appears, however,
to be perhaps genuine.

674
00:46:19,685 --> 00:46:22,377
And maybe this ashtray provides
the accidental bread crumb.

675
00:46:22,624 --> 00:46:24,442
The charred fragment of a note.

676
00:46:24,708 --> 00:46:27,602
An attempt, perhaps,
to burn the evidence.

677
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:39,239
He may borrow your
equipment... Yes?

678
00:46:39,307 --> 00:46:40,307
Thank you.

679
00:46:43,692 --> 00:46:45,857
Now, I quick up to understand...

680
00:46:46,157 --> 00:46:50,233
why a clue is left rather than
of what the object is?

681
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:54,755
We seek the truth from
within, not with out.

682
00:46:54,989 --> 00:46:59,778
In this case, however, I may
welcome a little scientific assistance.

683
00:47:00,293 --> 00:47:02,363
You will adjust the flame.

684
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:11,493
Not one of those nasty letters.

685
00:47:12,369 --> 00:47:13,369
You're mistaken, Mon'Amie

686
00:47:13,585 --> 00:47:15,636
This one has a secret to tell.

687
00:47:15,969 --> 00:47:16,984
Look.

688
00:47:21,081 --> 00:47:24,450
<i>"As a strong blood is
on hand, you will die."</i>

689
00:47:24,644 --> 00:47:26,184
What does this mean?

690
00:47:28,695 --> 00:47:30,283
Come with me, Bouc.

691
00:47:30,874 --> 00:47:32,765
Let us fill in the gaps.

692
00:47:33,945 --> 00:47:36,249
This was never a beach side puzzle.

693
00:47:38,381 --> 00:47:40,572
I know the dead man's real name.

694
00:47:42,002 --> 00:47:46,127
It is not Ratchett, but Cassetti.

695
00:47:46,435 --> 00:47:47,629
I know that name.

696
00:47:47,961 --> 00:47:50,133
Then you will also know the
name Armstrong.

697
00:47:50,414 --> 00:47:52,280
<i>The Armstrong case?</i>

698
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:54,286
<i>History shook the world.</i>

699
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:55,600
<i>Two years ago...</i>

700
00:47:55,642 --> 00:47:57,786
<i>the renowned pilot,
Colonel John Armstrong...</i>

701
00:47:57,946 --> 00:48:01,659
<i>and his wife, Sonia, woke to find
their only child, little Daisy...</i>

702
00:48:06,015 --> 00:48:07,045
<i>Desperate...</i>

703
00:48:07,336 --> 00:48:08,870
<i>The Armstrongs paid the ransom.</i>

704
00:48:09,196 --> 00:48:12,958
<i>But soon after, Daisy
was found murdered by...</i>

705
00:48:13,233 --> 00:48:16,401
<i>Ratchett, who was Cassetti.</i>

706
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:21,398
<i>Sonia Armstrong was with child
when she received the news.</i>

707
00:48:21,681 --> 00:48:24,329
<i>The shock sent her into
premature labor.</i>

708
00:48:24,633 --> 00:48:27,273
<i>Neither she, nor her baby survived.</i>

709
00:48:28,409 --> 00:48:29,817
<i>How do you know this, Poirot?</i>

710
00:48:30,017 --> 00:48:32,275
Because John Armstrong
told me so himself.

711
00:48:32,467 --> 00:48:34,216
He wrote to me to ask me for my help.

712
00:48:34,449 --> 00:48:36,304
By the time I received the letter...

713
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,147
it was too late.

714
00:48:40,942 --> 00:48:43,246
<i>He was found dead of a gunshot wound.</i>

715
00:48:44,662 --> 00:48:46,133
<i>Self-inflicted.</i>

716
00:48:48,401 --> 00:48:53,457
<i>"Daisy Armstrong's blood is on
your hands, you will die for it."</i>

717
00:48:53,736 --> 00:48:56,117
Indeed you did.

718
00:48:56,284 --> 00:48:57,945
- Monsieur Poirot?
- Yes, Michel.

719
00:48:58,272 --> 00:49:01,695
Mrs. Hubbard wants to talk to you.
I held her as best as I could.

720
00:49:02,596 --> 00:49:05,056
Uh. Mrs. Hubbard, I am
sorry to have kept you.

721
00:49:05,241 --> 00:49:07,367
You have a head full of steam
and a mouth full of words.

722
00:49:07,391 --> 00:49:09,471
You goddamn right I do.
What I have been trying to...

723
00:49:09,681 --> 00:49:11,303
to tell you all day.

724
00:49:11,649 --> 00:49:15,033
The murderer with in my
compartment last night.

725
00:49:15,561 --> 00:49:17,881
I thought I would be killed.
Turns out I might have been...

726
00:49:17,953 --> 00:49:20,516
Only he got Rachette instead.

727
00:49:20,696 --> 00:49:23,056
I woke up in the dark and I knew
there was a man in my room.

728
00:49:23,696 --> 00:49:25,444
You were certain it was a man?

729
00:49:26,169 --> 00:49:28,794
I know what it feels like
to have a man in my bedroom.

730
00:49:29,471 --> 00:49:32,107
I told your conductor, and he
wouldn't believe me.

731
00:49:32,355 --> 00:49:35,116
I said, "Check the communicating door
between my room and Ratchett's."

732
00:49:35,176 --> 00:49:36,974
"He must have left through there."

733
00:49:37,209 --> 00:49:39,705
Sure enough, it was unbolted.

734
00:49:40,281 --> 00:49:41,361
I know I locked it after...

735
00:49:41,507 --> 00:49:43,278
what Ratchett said.

736
00:49:43,531 --> 00:49:46,750
He made a rather
daring proposal.

737
00:49:47,574 --> 00:49:48,819
Have you perhaps...?

738
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:51,512
Heard about the
Armstrong kidnapping?

739
00:49:52,755 --> 00:49:54,071
You couldn't avoid it.

740
00:49:54,413 --> 00:49:55,523
Morbid stuff.

741
00:49:55,832 --> 00:49:57,592
The child's murderer, Cassetti...

742
00:49:58,584 --> 00:50:00,201
died last night.

743
00:50:00,488 --> 00:50:02,649
Ratchett was that man.

744
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:07,086
I told you, I knew
he was a rotten one.

745
00:50:08,653 --> 00:50:09,653
You do believe me...?

746
00:50:09,723 --> 00:50:11,725
About the man in my room?

747
00:50:11,959 --> 00:50:13,855
I am aware that you
think I'm a silly woman.

748
00:50:14,101 --> 00:50:16,090
But I have proof that it's true.

749
00:50:22,483 --> 00:50:24,878
Might have fallen off Michel
when he was in your room.

750
00:50:26,133 --> 00:50:27,133
I'm not missing it.

751
00:50:27,331 --> 00:50:29,299
I found it at the foot of
my bed, on the cover...

752
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:31,213
right where I slept.

753
00:50:31,443 --> 00:50:32,443
What do you call that?

754
00:50:32,611 --> 00:50:34,851
I call it evidence.
Thank you very much, Mrs. Hubbard.

755
00:50:40,254 --> 00:50:41,581
Have you ever been to America?

756
00:50:41,848 --> 00:50:43,329
Once.

757
00:50:43,477 --> 00:50:45,016
Years ago, briefly.

758
00:50:45,314 --> 00:50:46,892
For what purpose?

759
00:50:47,096 --> 00:50:49,110
- To confirm a suspicion.
- Which was?

760
00:50:49,331 --> 00:50:50,558
That I wouldn't like it.

761
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,300
I was offered a post in Boston.

762
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:54,270
From Boston went straight back to London.

763
00:50:54,349 --> 00:50:56,851
- Is that where Rachette was from? Boston?
- I don't know.

764
00:50:58,224 --> 00:50:59,289
It wouldn't be proper...

765
00:50:59,819 --> 00:51:01,020
to ask.

766
00:51:02,936 --> 00:51:03,936
Carry on.

767
00:51:04,067 --> 00:51:05,304
The last I saw...

768
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:08,618
Mr. Ratchett at nine o'clock.

769
00:51:08,781 --> 00:51:12,572
I brought his coffee and
hung up his clothes.

770
00:51:17,037 --> 00:51:19,335
You have the tooth ache I think.

771
00:51:20,268 --> 00:51:22,308
I have got an extraction
booked in London this week.

772
00:51:22,366 --> 00:51:25,630
Mr. Ratchett insisted on not
putting it off any longer.

773
00:51:25,908 --> 00:51:28,102
He said he was tired of hearing
my suppressed groans.

774
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:29,416
This sympathetic Ratchett?

775
00:51:29,549 --> 00:51:31,885
Was it his usual practice
to drink coffee at night?

776
00:51:32,216 --> 00:51:36,124
Not at all.
But he had been very agitated lately.

777
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:40,108
He said he wanted to stay alert.
Especially through the last night.

778
00:51:40,343 --> 00:51:42,556
He found a letter in his compartment.

779
00:51:43,789 --> 00:51:45,532
Please tell me you didn't do this.

780
00:51:45,841 --> 00:51:48,344
If I am to leave something
unpleasant on your pillow, sir...

781
00:51:48,609 --> 00:51:50,018
It would not be a letter.

782
00:51:51,141 --> 00:51:52,337
Coffee.

783
00:51:55,016 --> 00:51:56,079
<i>Surely such a...</i>

784
00:51:56,587 --> 00:51:59,138
profound and precise valet...

785
00:51:59,419 --> 00:52:01,139
would never speak to his master
how you did.

786
00:52:02,196 --> 00:52:06,316
Unless he knew his career was
coming to a sudden...

787
00:52:07,544 --> 00:52:08,958
End.

788
00:52:10,487 --> 00:52:12,982
Not mere tooth ache I think.

789
00:52:14,168 --> 00:52:15,168
The lungs?

790
00:52:17,911 --> 00:52:19,260
The thyroid.

791
00:52:20,162 --> 00:52:23,767
Spread now to stomach.
Ends with my father, five years younger.

792
00:52:25,548 --> 00:52:26,988
Months have passed.

793
00:52:28,739 --> 00:52:30,604
"Inoperable, I am afraid,"
said the doctor.

794
00:52:30,771 --> 00:52:33,591
Suddenly I wasn't afraid.

795
00:52:34,424 --> 00:52:37,278
I would only do what I wanted.

796
00:52:37,515 --> 00:52:38,515
I speak my mind now.

797
00:52:39,992 --> 00:52:41,113
The coffee.

798
00:52:41,815 --> 00:52:43,807
It appears that his cup was
mixed with the Barbital.

799
00:52:43,831 --> 00:52:45,872
You of course, would tell me
that you did not put it in there.

800
00:52:45,896 --> 00:52:46,896
Of course I did not.

801
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:50,209
When and from where did you
procure the coffee and the cups?

802
00:52:50,797 --> 00:52:51,939
In the kitchen, sir.

803
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:56,151
I ordered it at dinner to be
ready at 9, and so it was.

804
00:52:56,439 --> 00:52:59,415
Anyone could have
got hold of it before me.

805
00:53:06,903 --> 00:53:08,406
Mr. Masterman.

806
00:53:08,908 --> 00:53:10,774
I'm sorry about the tooth ache.

807
00:53:20,548 --> 00:53:22,289
I love the little cakes.

808
00:53:23,763 --> 00:53:25,965
So, Miss Pilar Estravados,
you are a missionary...

809
00:53:26,263 --> 00:53:28,823
but you've trained as a nurse
before you change profession, yes?

810
00:53:29,378 --> 00:53:30,620
I owed it to God.

811
00:53:30,876 --> 00:53:33,063
You owed him a debt?

812
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:35,946
There were...

813
00:53:37,634 --> 00:53:40,279
indulgent times in my life...

814
00:53:41,239 --> 00:53:44,578
when I took more than I gave.

815
00:53:44,892 --> 00:53:45,987
<i>Gerhard Hardman.</i>

816
00:53:46,208 --> 00:53:48,698
Professor of Engineering.

817
00:53:48,936 --> 00:53:53,183
It is science that will
win back for Germany her pride.

818
00:53:54,263 --> 00:53:57,949
Mr. Marquez, listen, I want to be clear
of any association with the crime...

819
00:53:58,237 --> 00:53:59,277
so please ask me anything.

820
00:53:59,368 --> 00:54:01,453
Anything, I never lie anymore.

821
00:54:01,699 --> 00:54:03,619
Did you leave your compartment
at all last night?

822
00:54:03,799 --> 00:54:06,684
Only once, to get an aspirin.

823
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:09,409
Mrs. Hubbard offered me something earlier.

824
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:11,479
I declined it first
but when I could not rest...

825
00:54:11,661 --> 00:54:13,174
I went to ask for it.

826
00:54:13,425 --> 00:54:15,524
My conference is in Turin.

827
00:54:15,703 --> 00:54:19,063
I am the only Austrian
to present, which means without me...

828
00:54:19,414 --> 00:54:21,266
the talks would be sub standard.

829
00:54:21,559 --> 00:54:24,331
Then I escaped prison, and I drived myself
into the United States...

830
00:54:24,585 --> 00:54:26,838
where I swore never to
lie or steal again.

831
00:54:27,126 --> 00:54:29,726
You see my friends, because when
people trust you, they buy more.

832
00:54:29,935 --> 00:54:33,391
The Italians are cows.
The Spaniards, sheep.

833
00:54:33,559 --> 00:54:35,199
The Belgians...

834
00:54:36,919 --> 00:54:41,242
Nothing, I come to my room, which I share
with the unhappy English butler.

835
00:54:41,527 --> 00:54:43,686
Annoying? He... Groans a lot.

836
00:54:43,927 --> 00:54:46,519
But I am sure he saw me sleep
all night until morning.

837
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:48,326
I should say...

838
00:54:48,569 --> 00:54:50,956
in case it is relevant.

839
00:54:51,222 --> 00:54:53,430
There was an embarrassing moment.

840
00:54:53,657 --> 00:54:55,450
When I went to see Mrs. Hubbard...

841
00:54:55,734 --> 00:54:57,462
first I opened the wrong door.

842
00:54:58,422 --> 00:54:59,855
I am sorry.

843
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:01,153
<i>What time was this?</i>

844
00:55:01,408 --> 00:55:02,599
<i>That must have been about...</i>

845
00:55:02,848 --> 00:55:03,991
Don't be sorry.

846
00:55:04,993 --> 00:55:06,817
Twenty minutes to 11:00.

847
00:55:07,692 --> 00:55:09,545
This is interesting.

848
00:55:09,805 --> 00:55:13,591
As far as it is known, you was the
last person to see Ratchett alive.

849
00:55:15,722 --> 00:55:17,206
- Your business?
- Automobiles.

850
00:55:17,377 --> 00:55:18,617
I have three showrooms.

851
00:55:18,853 --> 00:55:21,746
I come to America with nothing.
And now...

852
00:55:21,995 --> 00:55:24,030
If what you say is true, Miss
Debnham will confirm it.

853
00:55:24,054 --> 00:55:25,824
But it is true.

854
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:28,086
I would not lie.

855
00:55:28,224 --> 00:55:29,650
I would not lie.

856
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:33,110
May it be possible that Miss Debenham left
your compartment without you noticing?

857
00:55:33,463 --> 00:55:35,915
No. I sleep very lightly.

858
00:55:36,107 --> 00:55:38,870
With the slightest sound
I woke up right.

859
00:55:40,811 --> 00:55:42,629
I was surprised once.

860
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:46,152
Never again.

861
00:55:46,342 --> 00:55:48,009
No, I didn't say I was a chauffeur.

862
00:55:48,323 --> 00:55:50,624
The photographs that spilled
out of your luggage..

863
00:55:50,837 --> 00:55:54,529
There was a beautiful one, the
little boy, wearing a chauffeur's hat...

864
00:55:54,816 --> 00:55:56,286
visiting his papa at work.

865
00:55:56,310 --> 00:55:57,715
Who did you chauffeur?

866
00:55:59,037 --> 00:56:01,975
Ms. Estrada, why do your
hands have a calluses of a boxer?

867
00:56:02,249 --> 00:56:03,916
I do my work in dangerous cities...

868
00:56:04,849 --> 00:56:06,866
where I can not be governed by fear.

869
00:56:07,542 --> 00:56:08,542
I trained to fight.

870
00:56:08,612 --> 00:56:10,244
But you do not you trust your God anymore?

871
00:56:10,268 --> 00:56:11,494
Since you had surprise?

872
00:56:11,832 --> 00:56:14,089
No, in case he is busy.

873
00:56:14,688 --> 00:56:16,259
God is always busy.

874
00:56:17,152 --> 00:56:18,403
<i>It's Masterman.</i>

875
00:56:18,546 --> 00:56:20,229
A man dying he is the man
with nothing to lose.

876
00:56:20,253 --> 00:56:22,302
Bravo, Bouc.
Except for the problem of Mr. Marquez...

877
00:56:22,326 --> 00:56:24,446
who has now confirmed that his
bunk mate, Masterman...

878
00:56:24,693 --> 00:56:27,298
was reading in his bed
at the time of death.

879
00:56:27,563 --> 00:56:29,801
If it were easy, I would not be famous.
Next.

880
00:56:38,112 --> 00:56:39,112
Miss Debenham...

881
00:56:39,233 --> 00:56:40,633
You do not mind to brace the air?

882
00:56:40,979 --> 00:56:42,438
For you, we have the picnic.

883
00:56:43,701 --> 00:56:47,031
Oh, you made my room mate
suffer cramped... I see.

884
00:56:47,328 --> 00:56:49,848
Use the best location to extract
the truth from each suspect.

885
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:51,747
Put her off balance, me freeze.

886
00:56:52,278 --> 00:56:53,278
Clever.

887
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:56,127
Will you write on your full
name and address please?

888
00:56:56,362 --> 00:56:57,892
A pale move by the way.

889
00:56:58,133 --> 00:57:00,951
Ms. Estravados told me you
asked the the color of her dressing gown.

890
00:57:05,195 --> 00:57:07,392
<i>"Mary Hermione Debenham."</i>

891
00:57:07,949 --> 00:57:09,940
Do you ever go by Hermione?

892
00:57:10,198 --> 00:57:14,166
A constant Marry when I'm not employed
as "Miss Debenham." Left-handed.

893
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:17,138
Unusual, I know.

894
00:57:17,334 --> 00:57:20,054
You mustn't have your theory fixed
if you are testing my handwriting.

895
00:57:20,266 --> 00:57:22,037
What did you think of the dead man?

896
00:57:22,677 --> 00:57:25,397
I can't say. I didn't
think about him.

897
00:57:27,089 --> 00:57:28,381
Don't quite see the point of your question.

898
00:57:28,405 --> 00:57:32,267
Forgive me, mademoiselle, they
are my little originalities.

899
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:35,986
Human nature is perverse
in its complexity.

900
00:57:36,205 --> 00:57:39,712
To plumb it, it takes the right tools.

901
00:57:40,051 --> 00:57:41,622
These are toys, not tools, Hercule.

902
00:57:42,171 --> 00:57:43,408
And I prefer that you put them away.

903
00:57:43,432 --> 00:57:44,959
The direct method? Parfait.

904
00:57:45,193 --> 00:57:47,157
You knew the doctor before traveling?

905
00:57:47,477 --> 00:57:48,477
Dr. Arbuthnot?

906
00:57:50,144 --> 00:57:51,144
No.

907
00:57:53,621 --> 00:57:55,445
But such an instant attraction?

908
00:57:58,824 --> 00:57:59,984
We are not in America...

909
00:58:00,323 --> 00:58:03,844
Miss Debenham. There are
no laws against what you may feel.

910
00:58:07,073 --> 00:58:09,989
Nor are there laws against
silence, of which...

911
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:11,639
I'm hold my...

912
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:16,136
I have never been to America.

913
00:58:18,052 --> 00:58:21,948
Perhaps I may ask about some...

914
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:23,200
words I've overheard?

915
00:58:23,477 --> 00:58:27,251
You and the stranger, Arbuthnot,
are closer than strangers might be.

916
00:58:27,509 --> 00:58:29,311
You said:

917
00:58:29,549 --> 00:58:33,626
"Not now, when we're done,
then no one can touch us"

918
00:58:33,865 --> 00:58:35,288
What did you mean?

919
00:58:36,766 --> 00:58:39,349
Do you think I made a murder?

920
00:58:39,574 --> 00:58:42,197
To a man with a hammer,
every problem is a nail.

921
00:58:42,412 --> 00:58:43,944
You live crime.

922
00:58:44,156 --> 00:58:46,141
- You see evil every day.
- No so.

923
00:58:46,325 --> 00:58:50,661
I see enough crimes to know that
the criminal act is the anomaly.

924
00:58:50,814 --> 00:58:53,504
I think it takes a fracture
off with a soul...

925
00:58:54,128 --> 00:58:56,405
to murder another human being.

926
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:01,548
I ask again, what did you mean?

927
00:59:03,837 --> 00:59:05,641
As we established...

928
00:59:05,813 --> 00:59:08,409
there are no laws against my silence.

929
00:59:10,325 --> 00:59:11,669
Very well.

930
00:59:21,246 --> 00:59:23,772
<i>And afterward, Princess Dragomiroff?</i>

931
00:59:23,999 --> 00:59:26,217
After dinner, I went to bed.

932
00:59:27,307 --> 00:59:29,169
God blessed me with long life...

933
00:59:29,908 --> 00:59:33,054
but cursed me with a bad back
to make it miserable.

934
00:59:33,890 --> 00:59:36,190
About close to 1:00...

935
00:59:36,383 --> 00:59:38,165
I called for FrÃoulein Schmidt.

936
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:39,367
She massaged me...

937
00:59:39,562 --> 00:59:41,621
and read me for a while. Then I sleep.

938
00:59:43,104 --> 00:59:44,384
Were you ever acquainted with...

939
00:59:44,429 --> 00:59:47,489
a family by the name of Armstrong?

940
00:59:54,676 --> 00:59:58,040
They endured an unspeakable tragedy.

941
00:59:58,214 --> 01:00:01,531
I was an admirer of Sonia
Armstrong's mother...

942
01:00:01,691 --> 01:00:03,699
Linda Arden, the actress.

943
01:00:04,012 --> 01:00:06,805
A once a century talent.

944
01:00:07,829 --> 01:00:10,771
Miss Arden was to do acting.

945
01:00:11,434 --> 01:00:15,378
She would have become the first
woman titan of Broadway...

946
01:00:15,639 --> 01:00:17,420
were it not for the tragedy.

947
01:00:17,673 --> 01:00:21,051
And this, Linda Arden, she's dead?

948
01:00:21,307 --> 01:00:22,961
She might as well be.

949
01:00:23,927 --> 01:00:25,418
She no longer leaves her home.

950
01:00:27,911 --> 01:00:30,334
Daisy was my goddaughter.

951
01:00:31,543 --> 01:00:33,281
She was...

952
01:00:43,445 --> 01:00:46,202
I don's see how this relates
to our trouble, detective.

953
01:00:46,302 --> 01:00:50,011
The man, killed last night,
his true name was Cassetti.

954
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:53,167
The man who murdered
little Daisy Armstrong.

955
01:00:58,324 --> 01:00:59,789
I see.

956
01:01:00,062 --> 01:01:03,043
I admit, I know this family,
and now that man is dead.

957
01:01:03,945 --> 01:01:05,001
The coincidence...

958
01:01:05,082 --> 01:01:07,349
must seem unbearable.

959
01:01:08,141 --> 01:01:10,863
You may be permitted a coincidence.

960
01:01:12,751 --> 01:01:15,652
I must now ask a few questions
of you Froulein Schmidt.

961
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:16,903
No, there is no need.

962
01:01:17,236 --> 01:01:18,580
I can answer to her character.

963
01:01:18,836 --> 01:01:21,065
Even still, if you will allow.

964
01:01:22,193 --> 01:01:24,047
<i>Froulein Please answer in German.</i>

965
01:01:24,335 --> 01:01:26,206
<i>But your Excellency does not understand.</i>

966
01:01:27,124 --> 01:01:28,370
<i>That's what it is about.</i>

967
01:01:32,527 --> 01:01:34,286
<i>Is this yours?
H of Hildegarde?</i>

968
01:01:37,288 --> 01:01:39,170
That is silk.
It's too fine for me.

969
01:01:40,936 --> 01:01:42,795
<i>Is this the truth about last night?</i>

970
01:01:43,914 --> 01:01:48,088
<i>As she said.
She sent the inspector to look for me...</i>

971
01:01:48,606 --> 01:01:49,672
<i>Then I went back to bed.</i>

972
01:01:50,401 --> 01:01:51,881
<i>Did you see someone when he returned?</i>

973
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:53,725
<i>Only the other inspector.</i>

974
01:01:54,385 --> 01:01:55,627
<i>One who was...</i>

975
01:01:55,727 --> 01:01:57,407
"The other conductor."
You mean Michel?

976
01:01:57,982 --> 01:01:59,316
No. A different one.

977
01:02:00,748 --> 01:02:01,748
Please come.

978
01:02:03,883 --> 01:02:05,163
Are you sure you didn't see him?

979
01:02:05,227 --> 01:02:07,463
I'm certain. The other conductor was a
small man with a short beard.

980
01:02:07,487 --> 01:02:08,642
Froulein, there is no other conductor.

981
01:02:08,666 --> 01:02:09,666
I know what I saw.

982
01:02:09,801 --> 01:02:12,433
I remember because his voice was high
and the uniform was same exactly.

983
01:02:12,457 --> 01:02:14,070
Although I suspect missing one button.

984
01:02:14,206 --> 01:02:15,726
Sir, I need your pass key immediately.

985
01:02:15,934 --> 01:02:19,536
We need to find a uniform
and a red kimono.

986
01:02:19,678 --> 01:02:21,939
Thousands of photographs,
any less pair of socks...

987
01:02:22,259 --> 01:02:24,019
Dressing gowns in every colors, but red...

988
01:02:24,245 --> 01:02:25,885
still no contraband conduct his uniform.

989
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:28,376
Have we already checked all the
passenger of luggage?

990
01:02:28,606 --> 01:02:31,205
All except for the Count and
the Countess Andrenyi, monsieur.

991
01:02:31,229 --> 01:02:32,987
It is forbidden to search their suitcases.

992
01:02:33,299 --> 01:02:34,938
They travel under diplomatic visas.

993
01:02:35,187 --> 01:02:36,926
Where else could be?

994
01:02:37,129 --> 01:02:40,157
There is one last suitcase
we have not checked.

995
01:02:41,395 --> 01:02:42,395
My own.

996
01:02:46,996 --> 01:02:49,067
The killer is mocking me.

997
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:50,859
Good. His first mistake.

998
01:02:51,124 --> 01:02:53,950
And as the night must follow the day...

999
01:02:59,763 --> 01:03:01,911
No, it's not mine.

1000
01:03:02,211 --> 01:03:03,331
I told you of the conductor.

1001
01:03:03,443 --> 01:03:05,127
- Why would I tell you if it was me?
- You would not...

1002
01:03:05,151 --> 01:03:07,294
which makes your compartment
the ideal place to hide it.

1003
01:03:07,318 --> 01:03:08,348
Voila, the button.

1004
01:03:08,714 --> 01:03:11,164
And if the conductor's uniform...

1005
01:03:11,389 --> 01:03:16,075
Why not a conductor's pass key?

1006
01:03:16,414 --> 01:03:19,999
Now we know how the killer
magically passed through locked doors.

1007
01:03:24,137 --> 01:03:25,772
- Bourbon.
- McQueen.

1008
01:03:27,978 --> 01:03:29,019
Now what are we looking for?

1009
01:03:29,043 --> 01:03:30,043
Five hundred pounds.

1010
01:03:30,387 --> 01:03:32,849
McQueen also had a ledger
all his dealings with Rachette.

1011
01:03:33,007 --> 01:03:34,572
Where is it?

1012
01:03:37,972 --> 01:03:38,972
Poirot?

1013
01:03:41,257 --> 01:03:43,358
Bouc, keep everyone inside!

1014
01:03:44,979 --> 01:03:46,045
Please, stop!

1015
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:22,127
Mossier, stay where you are.

1016
01:04:33,372 --> 01:04:35,454
Thank you gentlemen. Thank you.

1017
01:04:44,499 --> 01:04:47,271
So, it was McQueen?
You have your man?

1018
01:04:48,986 --> 01:04:50,706
How could he?

1019
01:04:51,005 --> 01:04:52,005
<i>I didn't kill him?!</i>

1020
01:04:52,145 --> 01:04:53,307
<i>You tried to burn Rachette's accounts...</i>

1021
01:04:53,331 --> 01:04:55,728
but there are illegibly places.
The maths do not tally...

1022
01:04:55,752 --> 01:04:57,352
because you have been
stealing from him.

1023
01:04:57,422 --> 01:04:58,759
It is full of the...

1024
01:04:59,048 --> 01:05:02,078
The... The English word?
The chocolate?

1025
01:05:02,301 --> 01:05:04,445
- Fudge?
- Fudge. It is full of the fudge.

1026
01:05:04,703 --> 01:05:06,364
You stole from him.

1027
01:05:06,617 --> 01:05:08,071
You thought you would be found out.

1028
01:05:08,275 --> 01:05:10,248
That is why you killed him!

1029
01:05:10,446 --> 01:05:11,446
Yeah.

1030
01:05:12,555 --> 01:05:15,803
Yeah, you are damn right,
I stole from him.

1031
01:05:15,987 --> 01:05:17,181
Thousands.

1032
01:05:18,191 --> 01:05:20,739
I knew his money wasn't honest.

1033
01:05:20,979 --> 01:05:23,932
Who wondered it would matter
if I skimmed some of the top?

1034
01:05:24,232 --> 01:05:26,898
But let me ask you a question.

1035
01:05:27,261 --> 01:05:30,704
Why would I slaughter my cash cow?

1036
01:05:30,975 --> 01:05:31,987
I didn't do it.

1037
01:05:32,307 --> 01:05:33,613
- I didn't kill him!
- He didn't.

1038
01:05:34,610 --> 01:05:35,753
He didn't.

1039
01:05:36,654 --> 01:05:39,423
I expect his alibi revolves around me
drinking till the early hours

1040
01:05:39,645 --> 01:05:40,645
Well, it's true.

1041
01:05:40,755 --> 01:05:44,205
I saw him having whiskey and remarked
in the lesser quality of American liquor.

1042
01:05:44,422 --> 01:05:46,829
He offered me a tipple to
change my mind and another.

1043
01:05:47,635 --> 01:05:50,182
We got to arguing politics.
He had some...

1044
01:05:50,983 --> 01:05:54,250
tom-fool opinions on Stalin I had to
correct, but the man knows his spirits.

1045
01:05:58,279 --> 01:06:00,093
A word, please, monsieur.

1046
01:06:00,284 --> 01:06:02,124
You can't confirm you
were with him all night?

1047
01:06:02,277 --> 01:06:04,170
We smoked and spoke
till nearly 2, yes.

1048
01:06:04,424 --> 01:06:06,250
Ah such charms, him with
his cigarettes and you...

1049
01:06:06,274 --> 01:06:08,634
Ah yes, you are the only man on
the train who smokes a pipe.

1050
01:06:08,690 --> 01:06:10,546
May I see your pipe and
your tobacco, please?

1051
01:06:10,718 --> 01:06:11,718
Of course.

1052
01:06:11,842 --> 01:06:15,357
And you, Dr Arbuthnot, was traveling
from India, I believe. Yes?

1053
01:06:15,603 --> 01:06:17,198
You are interviewing me now?

1054
01:06:17,478 --> 01:06:19,410
Were you ever in Rachett's
compartment before he was killed?

1055
01:06:19,434 --> 01:06:20,320
Certainly not.

1056
01:06:20,402 --> 01:06:22,442
But this is one of your pipe
cleaners, n'est-Ce pas?

1057
01:06:22,512 --> 01:06:25,938
If you found that in the dead
man's cabin, look elsewhere.

1058
01:06:26,144 --> 01:06:28,638
I am a doctor, sir.
I heal people, I do not hurt them.

1059
01:06:28,850 --> 01:06:31,793
About this, you must have
worked very hard to become a doctor.

1060
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:35,172
Not many of your race are
allowed the opportunity.

1061
01:06:36,338 --> 01:06:38,298
Middlesex Medical college,
permits one per class.

1062
01:06:38,385 --> 01:06:40,232
I had the honor in '24.

1063
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:43,904
I was a sniper in my tour.

1064
01:06:44,210 --> 01:06:45,585
Sharp shooter.

1065
01:06:45,930 --> 01:06:47,290
Saved more than a few officers.

1066
01:06:47,471 --> 01:06:49,831
More grateful recognized
a fair mind with a steady hand..

1067
01:06:49,954 --> 01:06:51,665
They supported my education.

1068
01:06:51,932 --> 01:06:53,332
I took their generosity as a debt.

1069
01:06:53,393 --> 01:06:55,318
Did you know of Colonel Armstrong?

1070
01:06:55,634 --> 01:06:58,259
Might have know two or three Armstrong.

1071
01:06:58,533 --> 01:06:59,533
Tommy in the sixties...

1072
01:06:59,714 --> 01:07:01,775
- Selby Armstrong...
- No I meant, Colonel John Armstrong.

1073
01:07:01,799 --> 01:07:06,044
He had an American wife and his
child was kidnapped and murdered.

1074
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:09,200
Never came across them.

1075
01:07:09,393 --> 01:07:11,278
When did you first meet Miss Debenham?

1076
01:07:11,517 --> 01:07:14,407
We met when we shared the railway
convoy cart from Kirkuk to Nissibin.

1077
01:07:14,674 --> 01:07:17,741
She claims otherwise, and she has
made herself problematically suspicious.

1078
01:07:19,058 --> 01:07:20,636
Mary is a lady.

1079
01:07:22,418 --> 01:07:24,138
Leave her out of this.
I can vouch for her.

1080
01:07:24,168 --> 01:07:25,921
As you have vouched for McQueen's time?

1081
01:07:29,409 --> 01:07:30,929
- You won't listen to reasons.
- Never.

1082
01:07:32,594 --> 01:07:35,921
You are lucky. The good doctor insisted
he did not let you out of his sight.

1083
01:07:36,273 --> 01:07:37,753
See? There. I could
not have done it.

1084
01:07:37,922 --> 01:07:38,922
Yes, you could.

1085
01:07:39,121 --> 01:07:40,881
Rachette took a sleeping
draft each evening.

1086
01:07:41,042 --> 01:07:43,669
You could add Barbital,
easily access that drug.

1087
01:07:43,877 --> 01:07:45,837
Do the same with one of the
doctor's many drinks..

1088
01:07:45,861 --> 01:07:47,301
And the chance to kill him is clear.

1089
01:07:47,378 --> 01:07:48,444
Why would I do any of that?

1090
01:07:48,468 --> 01:07:49,624
We've established your motive.

1091
01:07:49,648 --> 01:07:51,495
Perhaps I would suggest a different one.

1092
01:07:51,698 --> 01:07:55,970
A different reason,
a more personal reason.

1093
01:07:56,121 --> 01:07:58,792
<i>"A lawyer by education,
not by disposition".</i>

1094
01:07:59,013 --> 01:08:01,807
Why did you pursue the law I wonder?

1095
01:08:03,045 --> 01:08:08,585
Was it to appease a much loved
but demanding father?

1096
01:08:09,626 --> 01:08:14,976
One who himself have made a great
success in the same field...

1097
01:08:15,154 --> 01:08:18,993
and then lost his position?

1098
01:08:20,064 --> 01:08:22,955
There was a renowned
McQueen, was that not?

1099
01:08:23,191 --> 01:08:26,647
The District Attorney for
the State of New Jersey...

1100
01:08:26,801 --> 01:08:31,758
responsible for the prosecution
of the Armstrong case.

1101
01:08:34,637 --> 01:08:36,809
They didn't have a suspect.

1102
01:08:37,909 --> 01:08:42,462
My dad was pressured to go after
this poor French woman...

1103
01:08:42,727 --> 01:08:46,446
a maid with a weak
alibi, Susanne.

1104
01:08:48,305 --> 01:08:50,258
He hung this whole case on her.

1105
01:08:51,537 --> 01:08:54,251
She killed herself.

1106
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:56,945
She was an innocent.

1107
01:08:57,265 --> 01:09:02,590
By the time the evidence led
to Cassetti, he was long gone.

1108
01:09:03,883 --> 01:09:06,256
It tore my old man apart.

1109
01:09:08,881 --> 01:09:10,716
I couldn't do anything for him.

1110
01:09:10,952 --> 01:09:14,027
And yet you claim that you did not
know Ratchett was Cassetti.

1111
01:09:14,266 --> 01:09:15,724
No. No.

1112
01:09:16,009 --> 01:09:17,143
But you found him.

1113
01:09:17,425 --> 01:09:18,358
No.

1114
01:09:18,385 --> 01:09:20,177
- You found him. You bled him dry.
- No.

1115
01:09:20,454 --> 01:09:24,681
In order to settle your father's debts
and then finally, to settle...

1116
01:09:24,913 --> 01:09:26,119
No, no, no.

1117
01:09:26,406 --> 01:09:28,144
No. It was not...

1118
01:09:28,422 --> 01:09:31,105
It wasn't like that.
It was not...

1119
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:36,543
- Some one, kicking the door.
- Doctor!

1120
01:09:36,817 --> 01:09:38,187
Covered my face!

1121
01:09:39,997 --> 01:09:41,691
Alright, this needs to come out now.

1122
01:09:47,419 --> 01:09:49,114
- I want my bag.
- Of course.

1123
01:09:49,294 --> 01:09:50,364
It's in my compartment.

1124
01:09:51,314 --> 01:09:52,556
There will be no fingerprints.

1125
01:09:52,580 --> 01:09:54,528
The killer was disposing
of the murder weapon.

1126
01:10:04,787 --> 01:10:07,056
The killer didn't hit her lung or artery.

1127
01:10:07,344 --> 01:10:08,696
She's lucky to be alive.

1128
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:10,098
You all are.

1129
01:10:10,363 --> 01:10:11,363
Yes, some genius!

1130
01:10:11,472 --> 01:10:13,617
Why haven't you solved this case?

1131
01:10:14,257 --> 01:10:16,071
You must give the man some time here.

1132
01:10:16,073 --> 01:10:17,273
Yeah? Well...

1133
01:10:17,521 --> 01:10:20,341
I can't give them much more.
I don't have any blood left.

1134
01:10:20,533 --> 01:10:21,371
Yeah.

1135
01:10:21,553 --> 01:10:24,310
Accosting Mr. McQueen and the
real killer is right here.

1136
01:10:24,507 --> 01:10:26,128
One of you people.

1137
01:10:28,451 --> 01:10:30,757
I don't know who you are.
I said nothing.

1138
01:10:31,037 --> 01:10:32,277
Please, leave me alone.

1139
01:10:32,549 --> 01:10:33,936
Say something.

1140
01:10:34,108 --> 01:10:36,196
My friends, the tracks will be
cleared by the morning please.

1141
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:37,540
Please return to your rooms.

1142
01:10:37,796 --> 01:10:38,796
I'm sleeping here..

1143
01:10:39,012 --> 01:10:41,092
Where everyone can see me
and I can see everyone.

1144
01:10:41,285 --> 01:10:42,956
You should all do the same.
Can't say of it..

1145
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:45,480
Remain in the open, safely in view,
until morning.

1146
01:10:45,702 --> 01:10:47,582
The killer will never
hesitate to kill again.

1147
01:10:51,652 --> 01:10:53,572
I will convey the same
message to the Andrenyi...

1148
01:10:53,755 --> 01:10:55,155
diplomatic immunity or not.

1149
01:10:59,878 --> 01:11:02,234
If you may, I will look
at your passports.

1150
01:11:07,674 --> 01:11:09,074
You know that I must talk with her.

1151
01:11:09,773 --> 01:11:11,561
By the way there is a grease
spot on your wife's name.

1152
01:11:11,585 --> 01:11:12,648
You might want to look at that.

1153
01:11:12,672 --> 01:11:14,115
Elena is not well.

1154
01:11:15,147 --> 01:11:17,803
If you do not permit me, your reluctance
will be noted to the Yugoslav police...

1155
01:11:17,827 --> 01:11:19,181
and I have no doubt that they
will arrest both of you...

1156
01:11:19,205 --> 01:11:20,906
- How dare you?
- Honey!

1157
01:11:29,904 --> 01:11:32,538
You are funny looking,
Monsieur Poirot.

1158
01:11:32,816 --> 01:11:34,966
All detectives so funny looking?

1159
01:11:37,626 --> 01:11:40,722
I am sorry to wake you,
Madame la Comtesse.

1160
01:11:42,330 --> 01:11:44,146
I'm always awake at night.

1161
01:11:44,357 --> 01:11:46,089
In the day I sleep.

1162
01:11:46,321 --> 01:11:50,246
Some fear darkness, but I
cannot stand the light.

1163
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:52,240
You are always under
the influence of...

1164
01:11:53,136 --> 01:11:54,136
Barbital.

1165
01:11:54,768 --> 01:11:56,059
Barbital, Barbital.

1166
01:11:56,991 --> 01:11:58,734
I take oceans of it.

1167
01:12:01,530 --> 01:12:03,408
Oh, there is no use in lie, love.

1168
01:12:03,653 --> 01:12:05,551
He can see right through us.

1169
01:12:07,493 --> 01:12:09,662
I can not go outside without it.

1170
01:12:10,863 --> 01:12:12,890
I can not sleep without it.

1171
01:12:14,758 --> 01:12:16,488
I take it against my fears.

1172
01:12:22,053 --> 01:12:23,053
What are you afraid of?

1173
01:12:26,467 --> 01:12:27,580
Everything.

1174
01:12:32,184 --> 01:12:36,570
Your passport has your maiden
name, as Goldenberg.

1175
01:12:36,783 --> 01:12:37,972
Jewish, yes?

1176
01:12:38,231 --> 01:12:40,559
Not so Jewish.
My middle name isn't Maria.

1177
01:12:40,847 --> 01:12:42,421
And you are a dancer like your husband?

1178
01:12:42,671 --> 01:12:44,361
No, not like my husband.

1179
01:12:44,624 --> 01:12:46,524
Code ballet.

1180
01:12:46,725 --> 01:12:47,885
He is touched by angels.

1181
01:12:47,973 --> 01:12:51,696
I rely by passion and
hard work to become adequate.

1182
01:12:54,768 --> 01:12:56,680
Excuse me.
I must lie down again.

1183
01:12:57,224 --> 01:12:59,573
Is this your only dressing gown?

1184
01:13:04,377 --> 01:13:08,045
No, I have another.
Golden-colored chiffon.

1185
01:13:09,491 --> 01:13:10,731
I like speaking to detectives.

1186
01:13:11,041 --> 01:13:13,107
You never know what
they will ask you next.

1187
01:13:14,063 --> 01:13:15,233
I am particularly good at capitals.

1188
01:13:15,257 --> 01:13:17,177
My governess was in a
strict love with Geography.

1189
01:13:19,965 --> 01:13:21,589
He is satisfied?

1190
01:13:21,851 --> 01:13:25,592
I am always satisfied
when I uncover a liar.

1191
01:13:25,946 --> 01:13:29,377
Madame, your name is not
Elena, it is Helena.

1192
01:13:29,551 --> 01:13:32,698
Despite your clumsy attempt to
change it here and in your luggage.

1193
01:13:34,511 --> 01:13:36,996
My husband heard of a
piece of evidence found...

1194
01:13:37,302 --> 01:13:41,128
a handkerchief embroider with an
"H", and I didn't want my "H" involved.

1195
01:13:41,337 --> 01:13:44,483
So we changed it.
The luggage and the passport.

1196
01:13:44,751 --> 01:13:46,828
It's no crime to want
to be distant from trouble.

1197
01:13:47,184 --> 01:13:48,698
Yet here is trouble.

1198
01:13:48,994 --> 01:13:52,639
A curious detail about the Armstrong
tragedy at the heart of this case...

1199
01:13:52,890 --> 01:13:56,195
how many people
were wounded by it.

1200
01:13:56,410 --> 01:13:58,102
The younger sister.

1201
01:13:58,319 --> 01:14:00,019
The actress mother...

1202
01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:03,259
stage name Linda Arden.

1203
01:14:03,283 --> 01:14:06,987
I suppose she too was
of Jewish ancestry...

1204
01:14:07,647 --> 01:14:10,543
as who is most likely
to take a stage name?

1205
01:14:10,705 --> 01:14:13,487
Is is too far to suggest?

1206
01:14:13,721 --> 01:14:16,590
Her original name was Goldenberg?

1207
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:22,115
Especially when we find a young
woman of the same age...

1208
01:14:22,276 --> 01:14:24,885
As her surviving daughter...

1209
01:14:25,103 --> 01:14:27,269
living in a world of fear.

1210
01:14:27,929 --> 01:14:30,869
The sister of Sonia Armstrong.

1211
01:14:32,662 --> 01:14:33,775
Get out!

1212
01:14:38,205 --> 01:14:41,453
I hear noises and I run.
Just in time, yes?

1213
01:14:41,703 --> 01:14:44,461
You must now believe the count
and the countess are the killers.

1214
01:14:44,654 --> 01:14:47,351
The count is protective. The countess is
not someone to kill a bedroom spider.

1215
01:14:47,375 --> 01:14:49,391
And you may desist with this

1216
01:14:51,247 --> 01:14:54,389
You are never an Austrian,
nor a German nor a professor.

1217
01:14:55,051 --> 01:14:58,812
But a good imitation.
Was it based on someone you know?

1218
01:15:04,079 --> 01:15:07,747
I'll look a butcher when
I grew up as a Kraut.

1219
01:15:08,011 --> 01:15:10,668
A good man, great accent.

1220
01:15:14,199 --> 01:15:15,288
What was it?

1221
01:15:15,567 --> 01:15:17,167
Said "Tu-ri­n"...

1222
01:15:17,399 --> 01:15:20,714
The emphasis on the wrong syllable
for a proud and proper Teuton.

1223
01:15:21,413 --> 01:15:22,890
"Turin".

1224
01:15:26,041 --> 01:15:30,095
You... Are a sharp knife,
I give you that.

1225
01:15:34,659 --> 01:15:38,019
Herr Professor Gerhard Hardman...

1226
01:15:38,307 --> 01:15:40,011
It's my cover.

1227
01:15:40,270 --> 01:15:42,510
I am sorry about the colored folks cracks.

1228
01:15:42,766 --> 01:15:45,605
Oh, I'm half a hid myself.

1229
01:15:45,838 --> 01:15:48,612
Cyrus Bethman Hardman.

1230
01:15:50,404 --> 01:15:51,804
You are a Pinkerton detective?

1231
01:15:51,895 --> 01:15:53,730
Thirty years.

1232
01:15:53,803 --> 01:15:56,697
I was in Istanbul, coming back
from my job when the office cabled.

1233
01:15:56,882 --> 01:16:00,634
Ratchett asked for a man to tail
him, offering triple time.

1234
01:16:00,836 --> 01:16:02,691
Like maybe nearby.

1235
01:16:08,110 --> 01:16:12,643
He told me to look out for a
small dark man with a high voice.

1236
01:16:13,358 --> 01:16:14,766
I watched that hall...

1237
01:16:15,005 --> 01:16:17,672
all night through a
crack in my door.

1238
01:16:17,907 --> 01:16:18,907
Any thug...

1239
01:16:19,024 --> 01:16:21,294
Had to go by me first.

1240
01:16:22,734 --> 01:16:23,888
I will take my oath on it.

1241
01:16:24,092 --> 01:16:28,984
And would you also take your oath on
your 30 years as a Pikerton detective?

1242
01:16:29,184 --> 01:16:30,518
Or would you lie to me again...

1243
01:16:30,692 --> 01:16:33,922
and deny that you were, in
fact, a police man first?

1244
01:16:34,179 --> 01:16:37,269
Your gun, the chequered grip,
the blue finish...

1245
01:16:37,614 --> 01:16:40,488
produced for the
Police Positive edition.

1246
01:16:40,741 --> 01:16:43,150
1927 issued.

1247
01:16:43,427 --> 01:16:46,519
It appears there are no end
to the lies manufactured just for me.

1248
01:16:48,291 --> 01:16:50,837
You can leave your gun
as you go professor.

1249
01:17:10,275 --> 01:17:12,746
From the position of his cabin,

1250
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:17,643
it would have been impossible to miss.

1251
01:17:19,758 --> 01:17:23,294
Unless Ratchett's
door was open...

1252
01:17:23,483 --> 01:17:27,237
as Pilar Estravados
claims she opened it.

1253
01:17:27,398 --> 01:17:30,435
In which case, someone
could have been...

1254
01:17:30,749 --> 01:17:32,982
masked from his view.

1255
01:17:38,733 --> 01:17:40,052
My dear Katherine.

1256
01:17:41,452 --> 01:17:44,131
This is an abominable crime.

1257
01:17:44,366 --> 01:17:47,462
And I'm struck, my Katherine.

1258
01:17:50,344 --> 01:17:52,679
I can not find the crack in the wall.

1259
01:17:53,902 --> 01:17:56,850
Why does one of them elude me?

1260
01:18:01,584 --> 01:18:03,267
I have always been...

1261
01:18:04,307 --> 01:18:05,684
So sure.

1262
01:18:07,116 --> 01:18:08,738
Too sure.

1263
01:18:10,871 --> 01:18:14,875
But now I am very humble.
And I will say, like a little child...

1264
01:18:17,374 --> 01:18:19,066
"I do not know".

1265
01:18:22,251 --> 01:18:24,566
I'm very afraid, my Katherine.

1266
01:18:39,682 --> 01:18:41,082
<i>My apologies,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

1267
01:18:41,176 --> 01:18:43,821
<i>It is not safe on board while the
engine is put back on the track.</i>

1268
01:18:44,133 --> 01:18:45,653
We have to wait in
the tunnel. Thank you.

1269
01:18:45,677 --> 01:18:46,957
Where are they taking the dogs?

1270
01:18:47,011 --> 01:18:48,074
They will be happy.

1271
01:18:48,274 --> 01:18:50,555
- That's not right.
- Just to stretch the legs, it's good.

1272
01:18:50,965 --> 01:18:52,535
No, it's not alright.

1273
01:18:55,822 --> 01:18:57,445
<i>Are we stuck?</i>

1274
01:18:57,805 --> 01:18:59,745
You asked for me?

1275
01:18:59,937 --> 01:19:00,937
Another interrogation?

1276
01:19:01,260 --> 01:19:03,491
Oh, no. I enjoy your company.

1277
01:19:05,133 --> 01:19:06,168
Ah... Please.

1278
01:19:07,799 --> 01:19:10,239
I have a list of ten questions I
am not nearer to answering...

1279
01:19:10,399 --> 01:19:12,290
and the train is about to leave.

1280
01:19:12,403 --> 01:19:14,457
You have a clear mind...

1281
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:18,324
and I thought you might
produce an insight.

1282
01:19:22,662 --> 01:19:25,474
<i>"The handkerchief."</i>

1283
01:19:25,775 --> 01:19:29,249
<i>"The scarlet kimono. The uniform."</i>

1284
01:19:29,464 --> 01:19:31,560
<i>"The time on the watch."</i>

1285
01:19:31,717 --> 01:19:35,351
<i>"Was he murdered then?
Earlier or later?"</i>

1286
01:19:35,565 --> 01:19:37,781
<i>"By one person or more?"</i>

1287
01:19:38,061 --> 01:19:39,636
<i>"Which of them?"</i>

1288
01:19:42,627 --> 01:19:44,209
Sorry, I can't help you.

1289
01:19:48,460 --> 01:19:51,049
Perhaps there's an eleventh
question you don't know to ask yet...

1290
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:53,232
that will give you the answer to the rest.

1291
01:19:53,517 --> 01:19:54,687
Perhaps.

1292
01:19:55,917 --> 01:19:59,507
I could point and easy finger
at the Countess Andrenyi,

1293
01:19:59,776 --> 01:20:01,965
I discovered she was Sonia
Armstrong's sister.

1294
01:20:02,254 --> 01:20:03,597
- Are you certain?
- Yes

1295
01:20:03,752 --> 01:20:05,352
I suspect she may perhaps be innocent.

1296
01:20:05,524 --> 01:20:06,710
Perhaps.

1297
01:20:07,006 --> 01:20:09,621
But so many people have lied to me
on this train, I do not seem to mind.

1298
01:20:09,645 --> 01:20:11,925
- You yourself did so effortlessly.
- Me?

1299
01:20:12,187 --> 01:20:13,867
You told me you've
never been to America.

1300
01:20:13,965 --> 01:20:16,372
You also concealed the fact that at
the time of the tragedy...

1301
01:20:16,396 --> 01:20:18,356
you were living in the
Armstrong Household...

1302
01:20:18,476 --> 01:20:20,890
as governess to their daughter.
And you know this.

1303
01:20:21,164 --> 01:20:22,757
I have my living to get.

1304
01:20:23,085 --> 01:20:24,987
A girl detained in connection
to a murder case...

1305
01:20:25,011 --> 01:20:26,571
No decent family would engage me.

1306
01:20:26,722 --> 01:20:29,271
Miss Debenham, you planned
Rachette's murder.

1307
01:20:29,501 --> 01:20:31,461
And then you sent for the
Countess to witness it.

1308
01:20:31,652 --> 01:20:34,519
If she saw him dead, the Helena
you knew might return.

1309
01:20:34,722 --> 01:20:36,922
You waited for your room mate to
sleep, and she did not.

1310
01:20:36,946 --> 01:20:39,266
You drugged her.
But the Barbital only gave her a headache.

1311
01:20:39,330 --> 01:20:40,383
She begged for an aspirin!

1312
01:20:40,609 --> 01:20:42,179
When the train stopped,
When the conductor was on the station...

1313
01:20:42,203 --> 01:20:43,273
when the coach was clear at last,

1314
01:20:43,297 --> 01:20:45,684
when you were allowed to enter
Rachette's compartment, unseen!

1315
01:20:45,708 --> 01:20:47,649
You loved Daisy Armstrong.
You killed Cassetti!

1316
01:20:51,692 --> 01:20:53,186
Cassetti was a pig.

1317
01:20:53,374 --> 01:20:54,975
He deserved to die.

1318
01:21:03,405 --> 01:21:04,923
She didn't kill him.

1319
01:21:07,164 --> 01:21:08,610
I did.

1320
01:21:13,239 --> 01:21:14,472
Mary, go.

1321
01:21:15,495 --> 01:21:16,934
I can't let you take the blame...

1322
01:21:16,981 --> 01:21:18,541
for what I did alone.

1323
01:21:23,866 --> 01:21:25,413
Mary, please go.

1324
01:21:28,941 --> 01:21:32,072
John Armstrong was my best
friend, my commander.

1325
01:21:33,919 --> 01:21:35,564
He believed in me.

1326
01:21:36,375 --> 01:21:39,553
He sent me to medical
school, gave me a future.

1327
01:21:40,801 --> 01:21:42,993
Cassetti destroyed it.

1328
01:21:45,121 --> 01:21:47,043
In grief, I found Mary.

1329
01:21:48,812 --> 01:21:50,657
And I found Ratchett.

1330
01:21:52,426 --> 01:21:56,461
Our plan was to avail him to
the police, that's what you heard.

1331
01:21:57,505 --> 01:21:59,803
But when I saw his face...

1332
01:22:01,811 --> 01:22:03,862
I knew he didn't deserve a trial.

1333
01:22:04,460 --> 01:22:07,490
So, you drugged McQueen.

1334
01:22:07,695 --> 01:22:09,627
You changed the time on the watch...

1335
01:22:09,863 --> 01:22:12,578
so that you could lie about
the time of death.

1336
01:22:12,819 --> 01:22:15,055
I couldn't let Mary be accused.

1337
01:22:15,329 --> 01:22:16,424
Or McQueen.

1338
01:22:18,008 --> 01:22:21,221
My sins are mine to pay for alone.

1339
01:22:21,932 --> 01:22:23,394
I am a soldier.

1340
01:22:23,572 --> 01:22:25,005
A soldier kills to protect.

1341
01:22:26,069 --> 01:22:28,795
And now, Mr. Poirot, I must
protect myself from you.

1342
01:22:38,924 --> 01:22:41,579
Why aren't you dead yet?

1343
01:22:46,700 --> 01:22:48,123
Poirot?

1344
01:23:01,987 --> 01:23:03,659
<i>Gentlemen, stop!</i>

1345
01:23:04,612 --> 01:23:07,490
Sir, you need to get all
the passengers back on the train.

1346
01:23:08,781 --> 01:23:10,817
You will retire...

1347
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:12,827
away from the train...

1348
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:17,112
until I tell you to return.

1349
01:23:34,652 --> 01:23:36,271
You tell your lies.

1350
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:39,200
Then you think no one will know.

1351
01:23:39,969 --> 01:23:42,298
But there are two people who will know.

1352
01:23:42,891 --> 01:23:44,506
Yes, two people.

1353
01:23:45,391 --> 01:23:46,945
Your God...

1354
01:23:48,043 --> 01:23:50,192
and the Hercule Poirot.

1355
01:23:53,962 --> 01:23:56,918
It is time to solve this case.

1356
01:24:17,238 --> 01:24:20,792
Dr. Arbuthnot asked me
why I was not yet dead.

1357
01:24:22,048 --> 01:24:24,171
He knew of course the answer.

1358
01:24:24,789 --> 01:24:27,381
A sharpshooter who does not
kill at close range.

1359
01:24:29,088 --> 01:24:32,134
Your shot was not a mistake,
it was a surgery.

1360
01:24:32,746 --> 01:24:35,436
You couldn't kill me because
you are not a killer.

1361
01:24:36,811 --> 01:24:38,870
None of you are killers.

1362
01:24:39,839 --> 01:24:42,191
And, yet, someone must be.

1363
01:24:45,039 --> 01:24:47,313
There are two possible
solutions to this crime.

1364
01:24:48,811 --> 01:24:51,597
One difficult, because it fits
with most, but not all of the facts...

1365
01:24:51,793 --> 01:24:53,122
and one more...

1366
01:24:53,417 --> 01:24:54,986
complex.

1367
01:24:55,894 --> 01:24:57,928
The first solution.

1368
01:24:58,049 --> 01:24:59,595
Ratchett had enemies.

1369
01:24:59,846 --> 01:25:02,861
A rouge mafia gets onto
the train at Vinkovci...

1370
01:25:02,961 --> 01:25:04,975
as McQueen and Arbuthnot take the air.

1371
01:25:05,177 --> 01:25:07,933
Equipped with a uniform and an
pass key, he stabs Ratchett.

1372
01:25:08,207 --> 01:25:11,179
He leaves through Ms Hubbard's
compartment and makes his escape.

1373
01:25:11,525 --> 01:25:12,525
No.

1374
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:15,800
No, no, no. It doesn't work.

1375
01:25:16,570 --> 01:25:18,379
Why hide the uniform?

1376
01:25:18,894 --> 01:25:20,335
Who drugged Ratchett?

1377
01:25:20,611 --> 01:25:22,531
Who stabbed Mrs. Hubbard?

1378
01:25:22,969 --> 01:25:24,515
Damn it man!

1379
01:25:25,678 --> 01:25:28,210
So I ask, who is next to benefit?

1380
01:25:28,732 --> 01:25:32,299
This crime is murdering of a murderer.

1381
01:25:32,854 --> 01:25:35,079
The benefit is, perhaps...

1382
01:25:35,616 --> 01:25:38,745
to the spirit, an
ease of suffering.

1383
01:25:39,910 --> 01:25:44,223
To quite a shouting voice in the
head that prevents sleep.

1384
01:25:50,457 --> 01:25:52,702
There is a murderer among us.

1385
01:25:54,135 --> 01:25:55,135
So...

1386
01:25:56,444 --> 01:25:59,975
We have Dr. Arbuthnot, a dedicated
grateful friend to Colonel Armstrong.

1387
01:26:01,326 --> 01:26:04,322
He meets and finds solace in the company
of the governess, Mary Debenham...

1388
01:26:04,565 --> 01:26:07,051
who is almost like a
mother to the little girl.

1389
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:11,781
And so close to Mrs.
Armstrong's young sister...

1390
01:26:12,043 --> 01:26:13,855
Helena Goldenberg.

1391
01:26:14,058 --> 01:26:18,575
Married to a powerful man,
no stranger to rage and violence.

1392
01:26:19,146 --> 01:26:22,719
We travel also with
Daisy's godmother...

1393
01:26:22,909 --> 01:26:25,471
to whom belongs...

1394
01:26:25,812 --> 01:26:30,703
the monogrammed handkerchief
found at the scene of the crime.

1395
01:26:30,868 --> 01:26:36,273
The letter "H" in the Russian alphabet,
of course, pronounced "N".

1396
01:26:37,174 --> 01:26:39,408
Natalia Dragomiroff.

1397
01:26:39,551 --> 01:26:42,145
And her devoted maid with the chef's eye.

1398
01:26:42,221 --> 01:26:45,909
Who was she before her current employ?
Might I suggest the Armstrong's cook?

1399
01:26:46,890 --> 01:26:49,873
But we are not yet done.

1400
01:26:50,292 --> 01:26:51,993
The nurse in charge of Daisy...

1401
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:55,281
her new found religious ill, born of
guilt of allowing her child...

1402
01:26:55,517 --> 01:26:57,358
to be abducted. It was you...

1403
01:26:57,400 --> 01:27:00,400
<i>who was in her room the night when
Rachette came in through the window.</i>

1404
01:27:01,792 --> 01:27:04,392
Did you have a glass of wine
too many with your supper that night?

1405
01:27:04,519 --> 01:27:06,018
Have you blamed
yourself ever since?

1406
01:27:06,076 --> 01:27:07,796
For not being alert to stop him?

1407
01:27:07,942 --> 01:27:10,574
She knew nothing but kindness...

1408
01:27:10,771 --> 01:27:12,816
and love, until...

1409
01:27:16,220 --> 01:27:17,403
until I...

1410
01:27:18,979 --> 01:27:20,850
No need to divine with me, sir.

1411
01:27:21,460 --> 01:27:24,787
I was Colonel Armstrong's
bat man in the war.

1412
01:27:25,599 --> 01:27:28,640
And afterwards, his valet in New York.

1413
01:27:29,926 --> 01:27:32,551
As fine a man has God ever made.

1414
01:27:32,778 --> 01:27:34,566
Would his chauffeur agree?

1415
01:27:34,890 --> 01:27:38,349
Was it a bank loan secured by Armstrong
allows him to build his automobile empire.

1416
01:27:38,634 --> 01:27:41,064
He is in debt for life.
Who else can we count?

1417
01:27:41,226 --> 01:27:43,853
What of the Pinkerton
detective, once a police officer?

1418
01:27:44,138 --> 01:27:46,103
Assigned to the Armstrong case?

1419
01:27:46,410 --> 01:27:51,388
And he becomes attached to some one for,
there is another uncelebrated victim.

1420
01:27:51,590 --> 01:27:55,219
You fell in love with the maid
before she was falsely accused.

1421
01:27:55,455 --> 01:27:56,945
<i>You quit the police when
you witnessed the...</i>

1422
01:27:56,969 --> 01:27:58,981
<i>the travesty of justice...</i>

1423
01:27:59,182 --> 01:28:01,911
<i>when McQueen's father insisted
on her arrest...</i>

1424
01:28:02,154 --> 01:28:04,341
when she took her own life.

1425
01:28:04,491 --> 01:28:06,434
<i>No! No, no!</i>

1426
01:28:07,659 --> 01:28:10,407
Susanne was a so gentle.

1427
01:28:10,772 --> 01:28:12,712
And she fell for me.

1428
01:28:13,578 --> 01:28:17,301
Old and already getting Grey.
I told her she could do better...

1429
01:28:19,474 --> 01:28:20,907
but there she was...

1430
01:28:21,546 --> 01:28:24,662
on time for every date.

1431
01:28:26,013 --> 01:28:27,031
Why else...

1432
01:28:27,255 --> 01:28:30,246
is a train so full
in the dead of winter?

1433
01:28:30,484 --> 01:28:33,396
Why the inconsistent **
Why the abundance of evidence. Why...?

1434
01:28:35,028 --> 01:28:37,105
Why the conductor?

1435
01:28:38,154 --> 01:28:40,494
Pierre Michel of Avignon...

1436
01:28:41,634 --> 01:28:43,653
who lost his sister...

1437
01:28:44,420 --> 01:28:46,332
the accused maid...

1438
01:28:47,019 --> 01:28:49,129
Susanne Michele.

1439
01:28:52,994 --> 01:28:57,745
Only one soul can claim to have
lost more than any of you.

1440
01:28:58,057 --> 01:29:00,810
The tragic Linda Arden...

1441
01:29:00,981 --> 01:29:02,999
Mother of Sonia...

1442
01:29:03,180 --> 01:29:05,254
Grandmother of Daisy.

1443
01:29:05,430 --> 01:29:07,363
Retired from the stage...

1444
01:29:08,029 --> 01:29:11,318
but for one final performance.

1445
01:29:31,661 --> 01:29:34,389
You are an awfully clever man.

1446
01:29:37,129 --> 01:29:40,349
A murderer should have one victim.

1447
01:29:40,606 --> 01:29:43,327
When Ratchett kills
Daisi Armstrong...

1448
01:29:43,615 --> 01:29:48,425
A dozen lives are broken,
deformed, ended.

1449
01:29:48,713 --> 01:29:51,113
They demand justice!

1450
01:29:51,838 --> 01:29:55,107
Of all these wounded souls, we
must finally answer...

1451
01:29:55,310 --> 01:29:58,088
Who among them is a killer?

1452
01:29:58,317 --> 01:30:01,922
Who takes up the knife?
The answer is...

1453
01:30:06,953 --> 01:30:10,038
Not single one of you could have done it.

1454
01:30:10,550 --> 01:30:12,160
Nor any pair.

1455
01:30:12,563 --> 01:30:14,963
It can only have been done...

1456
01:30:15,569 --> 01:30:17,257
by all of you

1457
01:30:18,154 --> 01:30:19,292
<i>Together.</i>

1458
01:30:22,334 --> 01:30:23,590
<i>Together.</i>

1459
01:30:25,032 --> 01:30:26,872
<i>Even when the avalanche
changes everything...</i>

1460
01:30:27,155 --> 01:30:30,601
<i>As does the detective,
plan was changed.</i>

1461
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:33,214
<i>The kimono, the uniform.</i>

1462
01:30:33,427 --> 01:30:36,688
<i>A remarkable improvisation, the doctor
knows how to wound without killing.</i>

1463
01:30:36,905 --> 01:30:38,633
<i>Each had their part to play.</i>

1464
01:30:38,932 --> 01:30:40,169
<i>Do it!</i>

1465
01:30:40,691 --> 01:30:42,146
<i>It was my plan.</i>

1466
01:30:43,433 --> 01:30:45,257
I recruited them.

1467
01:30:45,971 --> 01:30:48,233
I had Hardman track down Cassetti.

1468
01:30:48,456 --> 01:30:51,604
I sent McQueen to work for
him, and then Masterman.

1469
01:30:53,106 --> 01:30:55,891
McQueen could arrange the travel
on the day that Michel was on duty.

1470
01:32:33,716 --> 01:32:34,716
<i>Mr. Ratchett?</i>

1471
01:32:39,422 --> 01:32:41,148
<i>Goodnight.</i>

1472
01:32:42,728 --> 01:32:44,313
<i>And so it is done.</i>

1473
01:32:45,228 --> 01:32:46,920
<i>For the death of the innocent.</i>

1474
01:32:47,762 --> 01:32:50,468
<i>A life... For a life.</i>

1475
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:53,992
Revenge.

1476
01:32:55,480 --> 01:32:57,365
No one should hang for this but me!

1477
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:59,872
It was my plan!

1478
01:33:00,904 --> 01:33:03,803
Tell the police that it
was me alone.

1479
01:33:04,104 --> 01:33:06,890
There is no life left in me anymore.

1480
01:33:07,164 --> 01:33:09,982
They...
Have a chance now.

1481
01:33:10,197 --> 01:33:11,432
Helena, I prey...

1482
01:33:14,438 --> 01:33:16,101
Has a chance.

1483
01:33:16,552 --> 01:33:17,852
They can...

1484
01:33:19,188 --> 01:33:20,775
Go, live...

1485
01:33:21,454 --> 01:33:23,211
Find some joy...

1486
01:33:23,508 --> 01:33:24,874
Somewhere.

1487
01:33:26,887 --> 01:33:29,087
Let it end with me.

1488
01:33:32,343 --> 01:33:34,013
They are not killers.

1489
01:33:35,709 --> 01:33:37,694
They are good people.

1490
01:33:39,053 --> 01:33:41,243
They can be good again.

1491
01:33:45,064 --> 01:33:48,261
There was right,
there was wrong.

1492
01:33:48,820 --> 01:33:50,665
And now there is you.

1493
01:33:54,493 --> 01:33:56,647
I can not judge this.

1494
01:33:57,831 --> 01:33:59,512
You must decide.

1495
01:34:01,116 --> 01:34:03,356
Do you wish to go free without
punishment for your crime?

1496
01:34:05,327 --> 01:34:07,581
Then you must only commit one more.

1497
01:34:09,256 --> 01:34:10,469
I'll not stop you.

1498
01:34:13,778 --> 01:34:16,093
You can't let them kill you.

1499
01:34:16,892 --> 01:34:21,712
You give my body to the lake, and
you will go away innocent at the station.

1500
01:34:22,541 --> 01:34:24,153
You must silence me.

1501
01:34:24,726 --> 01:34:26,343
Bouc can lie.

1502
01:34:27,035 --> 01:34:28,571
I can not.

1503
01:34:32,611 --> 01:34:35,953
Do it! One of you!

1504
01:34:36,526 --> 01:34:37,787
No.

1505
01:34:38,368 --> 01:34:41,008
I already died with Daisy.

1506
01:34:42,572 --> 01:34:43,572
No!

1507
01:35:24,871 --> 01:35:27,394
You said your role was to find justice.

1508
01:35:27,657 --> 01:35:29,894
What is justice here?

1509
01:35:32,723 --> 01:35:34,984
Sometimes, the law of man is not enough.

1510
01:35:36,882 --> 01:35:38,814
Where does conscience lie?

1511
01:35:41,340 --> 01:35:43,864
Buried with Daisy.

1512
01:38:04,890 --> 01:38:08,020
<i>My Dear Colonel Armstrong.</i>

1513
01:38:09,142 --> 01:38:12,095
<i>Finally, I can answer your letter...</i>

1514
01:38:12,326 --> 01:38:17,614
<i>at least with the thoughts in head
and the feeling in my heart...</i>

1515
01:38:17,894 --> 01:38:21,111
<i>that, somewhere,
you can hear me.</i>

1516
01:38:22,214 --> 01:38:26,072
<i>I've now discovered the truth of
the case, and it is...</i>

1517
01:38:26,229 --> 01:38:28,681
<i>profoundly disturbing.</i>

1518
01:38:29,744 --> 01:38:33,003
<i>I have seen the fracture of the human soul.</i>

1519
01:38:33,477 --> 01:38:38,315
<i>So many broken lives, so
much pain and anger...</i>

1520
01:38:38,481 --> 01:38:42,171
<i>giving way to the poison
of deep grief...</i>

1521
01:38:42,402 --> 01:38:45,661
<i>until one crime became many.</i>

1522
01:38:47,270 --> 01:38:52,869
<i>I have always wanted to believe
that man is rational and civilized.</i>

1523
01:38:53,093 --> 01:38:56,263
<i>My very existence depends
upon this hope...</i>

1524
01:38:56,528 --> 01:39:01,585
<i>upon order, and methods
and the little gray cells.</i>

1525
01:39:02,690 --> 01:39:05,795
<i>But now, perhaps, I'm asked...</i>

1526
01:39:06,202 --> 01:39:08,194
<i>to listen instead...</i>

1527
01:39:09,179 --> 01:39:11,131
<i>to my heart.</i>

1528
01:39:17,048 --> 01:39:18,500
Ladies and gentlemen...

1529
01:39:20,125 --> 01:39:24,144
I have understood in this case
that the scales of justice...

1530
01:39:24,314 --> 01:39:26,766
cannot always be evenly weighed.

1531
01:39:28,030 --> 01:39:30,326
And I must learn, for once...

1532
01:39:30,522 --> 01:39:33,458
to live with the imbalance.

1533
01:39:35,130 --> 01:39:37,226
There are no killers here.

1534
01:39:37,510 --> 01:39:40,682
Only the people who deserve
a chance to heal.

1535
01:39:41,757 --> 01:39:44,378
The police have accepted my
first solution to the crime...

1536
01:39:44,639 --> 01:39:47,462
the lone assassin who made his escape.

1537
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:51,975
I will leave the train
here to conclude formalities.

1538
01:39:52,997 --> 01:39:54,896
You are all free to go.

1539
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:58,893
May you find your peace with this.

1540
01:40:01,263 --> 01:40:02,888
May we all.

1541
01:40:17,892 --> 01:40:18,892
Hello.

1542
01:40:19,482 --> 01:40:23,749
I'm looking for a Mr Poirot.
He is needed on a very urgent matter.

1543
01:40:24,997 --> 01:40:26,725
He is on holiday.

1544
01:40:29,093 --> 01:40:30,981
The Kassner case again?

1545
01:40:31,162 --> 01:40:33,476
No, sir, far worse.

1546
01:40:33,736 --> 01:40:35,536
I have to take you to
Egypt straight away.

1547
01:40:35,683 --> 01:40:39,139
There was a murder, sir,
right on the bloody Nile.

1548
01:40:41,957 --> 01:40:43,613
Are you the detective?

1549
01:40:45,221 --> 01:40:46,330
Yes.

1550
01:40:48,324 --> 01:40:50,383
I am the detective.

1551
01:40:51,060 --> 01:40:53,146
Could you please straighten your tie?

1552
01:40:57,009 --> 01:40:58,086
I will see you at the car.

1553
01:41:52,879 --> 01:41:54,199
Here it is, sir.

1554
01:41:55,309 --> 01:42:01,121
Subtitled by Clarity.
