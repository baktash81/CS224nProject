Here's to the only one
whose advice I ever listened to.

191

since you really lived.

of our brief stay in this world.

I should play it cool, right?

Do you know how the elders
of The Axe and Cross refer to him?

They call him "The Weapon."

Can you blame them?
What he does is so important.

230

Yes, that's true,
but he isn't just a weapon.

HELENA: My love.

1070
01:30:58,640 --> 01:31:00,210
You must get up.

1071
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:05,482
ELIZABETH: Father, you need to get up.

1072
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:08,685

(CHANTING)

1076
01:32:00,440 --> 01:32:02,920
You cling to your pathetic life.

1077
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:04,611
And for what reason?

1078
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:08,568
Those closest to you betray you,

1079
01:32:08,840 --> 01:32:12,606
and those you claim to protect
don't even know your name.

she's never truly dead.

1096
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:36,082
No, you can't! You'll die.

1097
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:39,380
I'm ready to face that reality.

1098
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:41,448
No! There must be another way.

1099
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:43,931
Listen to me.

1100
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:46,940
When I was pulled into the shadows,

1101
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:49,520
I saw that there were things
much worse than her.

1102
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:53,730
In the darkness. Waiting.

1103
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:55,321
Waiting for what?

1104
01:34:56,680 --> 01:34:58,045
The world without you.

1105
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:01,769
We still need you.

1106
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:04,889
I need you.

1107
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:13,809
The Axe and Cross betrayed me.
I can't trust anyone.

1108
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:15,291
You can trust me.

1109
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:20,881
800 years I've been on this road.

1110
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:28,289
Always hunting.

1111
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:31,369
- Always...
- Alone.

1112
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:34,524
You wouldn't be.

1113
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:43,940
Besides,

1114
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:46,281
you still owe me fifty thousand dollars.

(CHUCKLES)

1116
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:50,060

Oh. So we're negotiating, then?

(CHURCH BELLS TOLLING)

1119
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:03,602
The Axe and Cross would be bothered that

1120
01:36:03,720 --> 01:36:06,001
they're no longer in possession
of the Queen's heart.

1121
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:08,441
I don't serve The Axe and Cross anymore.

1122
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:11,170
This time I do it for me.

1123
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:12,561
Well, it's about time.

1124
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:19,449
You know, I used to think
the universe ran in endless circles,

1125
01:36:19,880 --> 01:36:23,009
always repeating itself,
always predictable.

1126
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:26,361
And now?

1127
01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:30,842
I don't know what happens next.

1128
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:34,486

01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:49,641
Well, then

I'm at your service.

1134
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:57,207
Come on. You're not getting any younger.

1135
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:03,044
So you ready to go, or what?

1136
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:06,321
