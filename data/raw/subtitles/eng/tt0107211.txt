1
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,940
<i>Losing Diana was like
losing a part of me.</i>

2
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:38,220
<i>I thought nothing could change
the way we felt about each other.</i>

3
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,140
<i>I thought we were invincible.</i>

4
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:47,860
<i>Someone once said, "If you want
something very badly, set it free. "</i>

5
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:52,020
<i>"If it comes back to you,
it's yours for ever. "</i>

6
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,260
<i>"If it doesn't,
it was never yours to begin with. "</i>

7
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:01,180
<i>I knew one thing.
I was David's to begin with.</i>

8
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,220
<i>And he was mine.</i>

9
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,980
Light up my life...

10
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,540
<i>We met in high school. David was
a senior and I was a freshman.</i>

11
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,540
<i>After glee club, he'd drive me and
my best friend home from school.</i>

12
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:21,140
<i>I used to watch him
in the rear-view mirror.</i>

13
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,300
<i>I fell in love with his eyes.</i>

14
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,700
<i>When I was 19 David proposed to
me on the pier at Paradise Cove.</i>

15
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,540
<i>Our parents were against it.</i>

16
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,540
<i>They said we were too young,
we didn't know each other.</i>

17
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:44,140
<i>But David said that a life
without risk is like no life at all.</i>

18
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,620
<i>So we eloped.</i>

19
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:07,860
<i>I graduated from architecture school
and got a job at a small firm.</i>

20
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,140
<i>Diana helped support us
by selling real estate.</i>

21
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,620
<i>I spent all my free time
working on a design of my own.</i>

22
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,980
<i>It summed up everything about
architecture that really mattered.</i>

23
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:22,060
<i>It was my dream house.</i>

24
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:53,780
D?

25
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,820
Have I ever told you I love you?

26
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,140
No.

27
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,500
- I do.
- Still?

28
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,300
Always.

29
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,860
<i>We had our differences.</i>

30
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:17,620
<i>He'd take his clothes off and leave
them on the floor. It made me crazy.</i>

31
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:41,300
What do you think this is?
Leaving your shoes on the table?

32
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:45,140
- I don't need to do your laundry.
- I'll pick it up. Don't get violent.

33
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:48,060
- What about this?
- Now, you put that down.

34
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,180
- You're gonna hurt somebody.
- I'm gonna hurt somebody?

35
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,500
You're outta your mind!

36
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,740
OK, now. Fine.

37
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,620
Goddamn it!

38
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,660
Now, come on. Let's just relax.

39
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,060
- Did I hurt you?
- No. I'm all right.

40
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:09,980
- I'm sorry.
- Really? You were kidding?

41
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,180
D, your pants are on fire.

42
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,300
You have no idea.

43
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:16,500
<i>We had no money, so for entertainment
David showed me architecture he liked.</i>

44
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,620
<i>But sometimes I'd have to ask,</i>

45
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,340
<i>"Why are we looking at
a stupid car wash?"</i>

46
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,660
<i>And he'd just say, "No, not stupid."</i>

47
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,340
<i>"Don't just use your eyes."</i>

48
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:30,340
<i>He made me look at things
differently.</i>

49
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,820
David, this is a steal. It just came in.
Nobody knows about it yet.

50
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,140
It's beautiful.

51
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,860
Build a house here.
You'd make a name for yourself,

52
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,340
because the house will be brilliant,
being by David Murphy.

53
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:47,620
<i>I found an incredible piece of property
in Santa Monica, by the ocean.</i>

54
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:50,420
<i>It was the perfect site
for David's house.</i>

55
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,260
We'll borrow the money.

56
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:56,340
These leverage stockbroker buyout
guys, you should see the junk they buy.

57
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,540
They would go crazy
for a house of yours.

58
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:04,300
<i>It was brilliant, even though
I didn't understand a word of it.</i>

59
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,540
<i>We had to economise
for the loan payments,</i>

60
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,580
<i>but it was our future
and I got to build my house.</i>

61
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,820
<i>And then the recession hit.</i>

62
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:21,820
<i>The real-estate market dried up.
I hadn't closed a sale in six months.</i>

63
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,220
<i>Construction fell to its lowest point
in years.</i>

64
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:27,740
<i>People were being laid off everywhere,
and I was one of them.</i>

65
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,540
- I feel really bad about this.
- I don't understand. What happened?

66
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,460
The bank has called in
the demand note.

67
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,020
Can they do that?

68
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:40,460
You don't have any income right now,
so they could attach your assets.

69
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,500
What assets?

70
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,020
Your house.

71
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,260
Gotta keep up those payments.

72
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,700
I'm sorry.

73
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,940
David, I'm scared.

74
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:16,780
We don't have any money.
What are we gonna do?

75
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:25,380
I'll wait tables or drive a cab
or something. I don't know.

76
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,420
I'll take care of you.

77
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,820
Make it go away.

78
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,220
<i>I was desperate.
We stood to lose everything:</i>

79
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:54,820
<i>The house I'd been building,
even our own home.</i>

80
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:58,580
<i>I swallowed my pride and borrowed
$5,000 from my father.</i>

81
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,300
<i>It wasn't enough.</i>

82
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,860
<i>We needed $50,000.</i>

83
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,620
- D...
- What?

84
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:22,060
- Get up. Get dressed. I got an idea.
- What time is it?

85
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,140
Hi! How ya doin'?

86
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,900
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh, my God!

87
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,940
Oh, honey!
That's the spirit!

88
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:03,940
Keep 'em coming! 50,000 of 'em,
that's what we want! We're winners!

89
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,500
Put some money in the kitty!

90
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:22,180
We got a shooter now, folks.
A lucky lady shooter.

91
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,860
Stack it, don't rack it.

92
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,580
And I have a lovely...

93
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:23,620
Why don't you put it on?
It suits you.

94
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,540
Well, I can't afford it.

95
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:32,660
- That's too bad.
- Yeah.

96
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:41,980
I really think you ought
to have the dress. Let me buy it for you.

97
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,820
You wanna buy me this dress?

98
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,660
Yeah.

99
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:51,260
- Why?
- I've enjoyed watching you.

100
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,660
You've earned it.

101
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,420
No, I haven't.

102
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,420
The dress is for sale. I'm not.

103
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:18,300
Roll 'em now, girlfriend!

104
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:32,140
I can't lose. I'm up over $9,000.

105
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,900
$9,000 up! This is my wife D.

106
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,180
These are my girls.
They're gonna be moving in.

107
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,300
Kiss 'em.

108
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,060
- Yeah.
- Bets, please.

109
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,580
- Did I ever tell you I love you?
- No.

110
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,940
- I do.
- Still?

111
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,420
Always.

112
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,060
5,000.

113
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:35,180
This little pile here, you guessed it.
Five more, D.

114
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,940
What do you think this is?
Five more.

115
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:42,900
Play with it. Roll around with it.
Enjoy yourself. Oh, my!

116
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:48,420
And the grand total is...

117
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,980
...$25,040.

118
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,580
So we're halfway there, like in an hour.

119
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:03,220
I figure about two hours tomorrow,
we'll be home free.

120
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,780
Come here.

121
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,020
What?

122
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,660
I love you.

123
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,620
I know that.

124
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:37,340
No, I mean even without the money.

125
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:07,340
Last call for wagers. No more bets.

126
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,780
Come on, black, come on.
Here we go.

127
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,940
Yes!

128
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,700
No more bets, please.

129
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,180
Yes, we won!

130
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:06,020
$4,100.
We said we wouldn't go below $5,000.

131
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,340
Do you want any more coffee?

132
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,300
No, thank you.

133
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,780
Tails we quit. Heads we go for it.

134
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,780
Two out of three.

135
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:53,020
Last call for wagers.

136
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,540
No more bets.

137
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:59,700
OK. I'm feeling lucky.
I say we put it on red.

138
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,580
All of it. Red.

139
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,580
I feel red. Do you feel red, D?

140
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,460
We can do this, huh?

141
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:15,740
I'm gonna put it on.
I'm putting it on red.

142
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,300
OK.

143
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,580
- No, it's black.
- What are you doing?

144
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,980
- It's black.
- What are you doing?

145
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,900
No, it's red.
Go with your instinct. Right?

146
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,100
- No more bets.
- Come on, man.

147
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,820
Gotta get it.

148
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,820
OK, come on red, come on red.

149
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,460
Too late, young lady.

150
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:54,420
Place your bets.
Bank side, player side.

151
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,780
All set? Cards, please.

152
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,940
Turning for the players.

153
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,700
Passes to the right, please.

154
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,740
Player draws nothing.

155
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,140
And set.

156
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,700
Player side, banker side.

157
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:30,180
- Who's that guy?
- That's John Gage.

158
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:33,740
He's a damn billionaire.
That's a rich son of a bitch right there.

159
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,420
He's down over
a million dollars already.

160
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,020
You see them little gold things
he's playing with?

161
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,340
$10,000 apiece.

162
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:44,540
Every time he lays one down,
10,000 big ones.

163
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:49,140
Look how cool he is. He must get more
pussy than you can shake a stick at.

164
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,740
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you.
- Player wins.

165
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,260
It's about time.

166
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,940
- Y'all married?
- Yeah.

167
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:02,380
- Stick around and gamble a little.
- Excuse me! Excuse me.

168
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:07,700
Would you mind lending me your wife?
Is that your wife?

169
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,180
Excuse me?

170
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:14,740
- For luck.
- Well, you'd have to ask her.

171
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:19,900
- May I?
- Go for it.

172
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,180
I don't think it's a good idea.
We should go.

173
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,500
- Just for a moment?
- I'll go.

174
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,820
Go ahead. It might be fun.
What have we got to lose?

175
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:30,780
- Well?
- Go and see what happens.

176
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:34,060
- Yeah, go ahead.
- We'll be here, backing you up.

177
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,460
Thank you.

178
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:39,460
See if you can get
a little of that money from him.

179
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:42,980
Do you think she'll ever come back?

180
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,460
I'm just bullshittin' you.

181
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:50,700
Have a seat.
I've been losing all day long.

182
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:54,780
Then you appeared and I won
my first hand. You brought me luck.

183
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,300
I'd say that's a sign.

184
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,300
Wouldn't you?

185
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:04,340
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thank you.

186
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,420
Candy?

187
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:12,020
Place your bets.

188
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,860
100,000.

189
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:19,180
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

190
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:27,660
- Not like that.
- Sorry.

191
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:34,220
All bets set? Cards, please.

192
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,020
Turning for the players.

193
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,500
Now, what we want...

194
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,460
What we need... is a nine.

195
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,300
We don't like that.

196
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,220
Player draws nothing.
Cards for the bank, please.

197
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:59,060
Bank's the winner with a natural eight.
Pay the bank.

198
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,460
I guess I'm not so lucky after all.

199
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:09,260
- Do you like cards?
- Not especially.

200
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,860
Wish I'd asked you sooner. Dice?

201
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,100
Yeah, I guess.

202
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:22,380
- Sam.
- Mr G?

203
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,540
One.

204
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:28,020
Excuse me, Mr G.

205
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,940
- Maybe I should go.
- This shouldn't take too long.

206
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,540
- What?
- This.

207
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,540
Now...

208
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,860
I hope you find this interesting.

209
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,020
Pit. Tadross.

210
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:00,540
Yes, sir. It's here now.

211
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,700
- Goes for one million dollars.
- It's a bet.

212
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,300
Here you are, Mr G.
One million dollars.

213
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,260
Bet it all.

214
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:12,660
Coming out. Crap eleven or any seven
this time. It is a come-out roll.

215
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,660
How much goes, now? Get 'em down.

216
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,740
Pick two.

217
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,860
Now just throw a seven.

218
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:28,820
If you wanna throw an eleven,
that's all right too.

219
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,980
Aren't you forgetting something?

220
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,180
Winner!

221
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,220
Think I oughta quit now?

222
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,340
I think I should.

223
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,300
Credit my account.

224
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:26,060
Sweetie, that was incredible.
Unbelievable.

225
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:28,260
Hi. John Gage.

226
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:31,100
- Hi. David Murphy.
- Hi, David.

227
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,300
Congratulations.
This is my wife Diana. I guess you met.

228
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,500
- Hi. Diana?
- Diana.

229
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:41,620
Thank you both. Very generous of you,
David. Are you staying at the hotel?

230
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:44,980
- No. Actually we're just leaving.
- Yes, we're on our way out.

231
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:49,060
No, don't do that. We gotta celebrate.
Let me arrange a room for you here.

232
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,140
- That's very nice, but...
- No, I insist.

233
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:55,100
Please. It's the least I can do. OK?

234
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:58,100
Really, just sign for it.
Anything you want.

235
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,820
There's some lovely shops
off the lobby.

236
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,500
Have you seen 'em?

237
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,380
Let's go.

238
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,420
How about that?

239
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:23,740
Wow.

240
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,780
D, what do you think?

241
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,820
Godfather?

242
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,780
You won a million dollars today.

243
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:41,340
- He won it.
- Honey, you won it for him.

244
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,580
This feels nice.

245
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,180
Don't get it. Just stay right here.

246
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:54,900
OK.

247
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,740
Hello. William Shackleford.

248
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:09,020
Hi. David Murphy.

249
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:13,300
For Mrs Murphy. From John Gage.

250
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,380
Well, thank him for us.

251
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:20,700
I'll do that. Mr Gage is hosting a
gathering tonight in his suite at nine.

252
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:24,580
If you can find the time in your
schedule, he'd be most pleased.

253
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,780
- Look what you got.
- What?

254
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,340
Gift from Gage.

255
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,500
Really?

256
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,660
Well, open it up.

257
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,900
That's $5,000.

258
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,580
How do you know that?

259
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,100
I saw it in the store downstairs.

260
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:02,100
- Lucky for him you like black.
- Yeah.

261
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:36,140
No past, no future. Just check
in to a hotel and start all over again.

262
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:41,740
I just stick 'em under the sheets...

263
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:45,100
That's strange, am I right?

264
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:53,220
- In another life, have a good time.
- Thanks.

265
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:07,980
Who is that guy Shackleford?

266
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,620
Someone who works for me.

267
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,980
Someone I trust.

268
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,620
He killed someone once.

269
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:26,860
Tell me, where do you see
yourself in, say, ten years?

270
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,940
Well, I wouldn't mind being
a billionaire like yourself.

271
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:35,180
Nice shot. I mean beyond money.

272
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,740
What would satisfy you completely,
let you sleep well?

273
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:41,220
Are you saying you're not satisfied?

274
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,460
Who is?

275
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,380
I am.

276
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,220
She mean it?

277
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,580
I hope so.

278
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:56,460
Well then, you may not have won
in Vegas, but you're a lucky man.

279
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,540
I got money, I got security,
I have businesses,

280
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:02,260
but you have something
that I just don't have.

281
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:05,220
I guess there's limits
to what money can buy.

282
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,380
Not many.

283
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,860
Well, some things aren't for sale.

284
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,740
Such as?

285
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,940
Well, you can't buy people.

286
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,820
That's naive, Diana.
I buy people every day.

287
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:25,100
In business, maybe, but not
when real emotions are involved.

288
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:28,500
What are you saying?
You can't buy love? Isn't that a cliché?

289
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:32,740
- It's absolutely true.
- Is it?

290
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,700
What do you think?

291
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,540
- I agree with Diana.
- You do?

292
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,980
Well, let's test the cliché.

293
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:50,140
Suppose I were to offer
you one million dollars...

294
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:56,780
...for one night with your wife?

295
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,820
I'd assume you're kidding.

296
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:07,020
Let's pretend I'm not.
What would you say?

297
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,420
He'd tell you to go to hell.

298
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:16,380
I didn't hear him.

299
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,620
I'd tell you to go to hell.

300
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:34,420
That's a reflex answer
because you view it as hypothetical.

301
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:38,420
But let's say that
there were real money behind it.

302
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,300
I'm not kidding.

303
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:46,700
A million dollars. The night would pass,
but the money could last a lifetime.

304
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,580
Think of it.

305
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,900
A million dollars.

306
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:57,580
A lifetime of security, for one night.

307
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:02,860
And don't answer right away,
but consider it.

308
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,700
Seriously.

309
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:09,220
We're positive, OK?

310
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,580
Then you've answered my question.

311
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:18,700
And you've proved your point.
There are limits to what money can buy.

312
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:23,300
It's late and I hate to admit it,
but I have a meeting.

313
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,460
May I have one dance?

314
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:28,300
Of course, with your permission.

315
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,500
I think you'd better
get on to that meeting.

316
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,700
You don't want to miss out
on your next billion.

317
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,980
Understood.
I wouldn't part with her either.

318
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,220
Goodnight.

319
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,820
Can't sleep?

320
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:40,580
No.

321
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,820
Me neither.

322
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:53,700
I just keep thinking about it.

323
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,540
It's so weird, isn't it?

324
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,340
Yeah.

325
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:11,020
David, I think you want me to do it.

326
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:17,660
What are you talking about?

327
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,820
Don't be ridiculous.

328
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:24,060
Maybe we should just talk about it.

329
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,660
Well, I don't want you to do it.

330
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,820
- But you'd let me do it.
- No.

331
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,100
Why? Do you wanna do it?

332
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:45,620
No.

333
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:53,060
But I would. I'd do it for you.

334
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,100
For me?

335
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:09,900
I can't believe we're even
talking about this.

336
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:16,860
Think about what this money could do
for us, what it could do for our future.

337
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,980
You could finish your house.

338
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:26,060
You could pay your dad back.
Get rid of our debts.

339
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,140
After all, it wouldn't mean anything.

340
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:32,340
It's just my body.

341
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:35,940
It's not my mind.
It's not my heart.

342
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:42,300
You think we could
do something like that?

343
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,700
We both slept with other people
before we were married, right?

344
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,140
Yeah.

345
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:57,460
So we just have to look at it like that.

346
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:04,620
I slept with Bubba Aruzio! If I can
do that, I can sleep with anyone.

347
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:07,980
- You slept with Bubba?
- You knew.

348
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,540
No, I didn't know that. When?

349
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:15,020
When you were off sleeping
with that slut Olivia Daigle.

350
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:19,740
- Olivia Deagle. And she wasn't a slut.
- Excuse me. Olivia Beagle.

351
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,300
I do love you.

352
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,020
- She wasn't a slut.
- Yes, she was.

353
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:26,300
No, she wasn't...

354
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,580
...unfortunately!

355
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:34,860
Thank God we can laugh about it.

356
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,820
Yeah.

357
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:40,140
That's easy to say now. After...

358
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:48,340
We just have to forget
it ever happened.

359
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:53,460
And never discuss it. Not even once.

360
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:59,660
Because nothing will have happened.

361
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:04,180
Nothing that matters, anyway.

362
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:15,540
We have a brilliant script. Very special.

363
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:18,900
It's a comeback vehicle for Diana Ross.

364
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:22,340
And Billy Ray Cyrus.
Kind of "A Star is Born"...

365
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,660
So your first screenplay
sold for half a million.

366
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:27,580
- Shoulda been two.
- Except our lawyer caved in on us.

367
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:31,100
- That won't happen again.
- We're gonna get a lawyer that's tough.

368
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:34,820
Someone that'll step on
his grandmother for us.

369
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:38,860
Mr Green. A David Murphy
wants to speak to you urgently.

370
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,580
Put him on the speaker.

371
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:43,340
This is an old college buddy.
It'll only take a second.

372
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:46,540
<i>- Jeremy?
- Davey, I'm in a meeting. What's up?</i>

373
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:48,820
<i>Listen, we need you to close a deal.</i>

374
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:51,340
<i>- What kind of deal?
- A very big deal.</i>

375
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:53,300
Big deal. Go on.

376
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:58,340
<i>We're in Vegas at the Hilton. We met
John Gage. You know who he is?</i>

377
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:03,700
Sure I know who he is. He's
a billionaire. And a major poon hound.

378
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,020
<i>He is?</i>

379
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,420
Go on.

380
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:10,060
<i>- He offered us a million dollars.
- A million dollars?</i>

381
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:12,940
For what? Your kidneys?

382
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:16,860
<i>For one night with Diana.</i>

383
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:22,580
What do you mean? One night? Like...

384
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,980
<i>Yes.</i>

385
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:30,380
Could you excuse me for a second?

386
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,180
Let me get this straight.

387
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:42,220
He offered you a million dollars for a
night with your wife? Your wife Diana?

388
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:47,060
And you agreed? I don't know
what to say. How could you do that?

389
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:51,700
How could you negotiate without me?
Never negotiate without your lawyer!

390
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:55,900
For a woman like Diana, I could have
gotten you at least two million!

391
00:41:55,900 --> 00:42:00,140
Obviously! You don't wanna
get screwed and then screwed!

392
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:01,940
Stay, please. This is damage control.

393
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:05,300
- Two seconds. Eat cookies.
- No. We've heard enough.

394
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:08,660
- You're hired.
- You're our man. We love your style.

395
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:12,020
Gladys, check the gentlemen's
schedules. Call me next week.

396
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:13,580
- Great.
- See you then.

397
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:17,340
- Thanks for coming.
- No. Thank you.

398
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:19,980
OK, David, before we go any further,

399
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:24,060
let's get the moral issue out of the way.

400
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:28,140
<i>- Leave that to us.
- No, I was referring to my fee. I get 5%.</i>

401
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,940
Would you elaborate
on the verification clause?

402
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:38,020
Verification. That means you pay, even
if the relationship isn't consummated.

403
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:41,420
You mean if I'm impotent.

404
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,780
It's important for a lawyer
to cover contingencies.

405
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,820
I can live with that.
The "John Garfield clause"?

406
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:51,940
That's if you die in the act.

407
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:58,540
I have no problem with that either.
Can I have your pen?

408
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:08,220
- You're pretty good, you know?
- Thank you.

409
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:09,820
You should come work for me.

410
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:23,420
We have a deal.

411
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:31,540
A million dollars will be deposited
in your casino account in the morning.

412
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:38,900
So...

413
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:41,660
So...

414
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:44,060
So...

415
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:48,300
You can go.

416
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,980
Gentlemen, I think it's time
for men of good will

417
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:54,620
to take leave of one another.

418
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,900
It's all right.

419
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,980
I don't bite.

420
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:27,660
So...

421
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:31,580
What, should I go undress?

422
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:39,300
Cheer up. Find a more creative way
to think about this, OK?

423
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:43,700
Just look at it like an episode of "The
Dating Game" that went a bit awry.

424
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:46,540
- It's gonna be OK...
- Ladies and gentlemen.

425
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:50,740
Me wish to welcome you
to our jamboree.

426
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:55,300
I couldn't believe it. I know
we could have gotten two million.

427
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,740
Here's your Buddha.

428
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:59,540
Davey, no point getting out
the crying towel.

429
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:03,300
You've got a million bucks, buddy.
A million bucks!

430
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:08,980
She's an amazing woman.
She really is.

431
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:12,860
Couldn't have gotten 500 for
my girlfriend. Not that I'd do that...

432
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:17,220
But it's OK that you did.
This is a different situation.

433
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,300
And she agreed to it,
you gotta remember that.

434
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:24,140
And it's not like it's hard duty or
anything. Hell, he's a great-looking guy.

435
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:27,180
For a million bucks, I'd sleep with him.

436
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:30,500
Maybe not.

437
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,860
Hey, buddy!

438
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:46,020
Come on!

439
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:55,260
Come on!

440
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:00,700
What have I done?

441
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:16,540
D, it's me!

442
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:18,420
D!

443
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:20,780
D!

444
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:27,220
Where is she? Where's my wife?

445
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:33,620
Diana!

446
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:36,780
Please!

447
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:38,620
Where did they go?

448
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:41,620
- Up!
- Up where?

449
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,380
<i>- Helicóptero.
- Helicopter.</i>

450
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:01,620
D!

451
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:07,180
D!

452
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:10,500
D! D!

453
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:17,540
D!

454
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:29,460
They sent for me.
They said you were ready.

455
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:43,660
Come here.

456
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:07,260
You missed a button.

457
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:16,620
Thank you.

458
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:20,820
I wanna show you something.

459
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:39,180
- What happened?
- Lights went off.

460
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:44,420
I see that. Why?

461
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:49,620
Look.

462
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:57,340
Can you turn those off, too?

463
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:02,220
I'm working on it.

464
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:09,180
Who made the decision?

465
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:15,860
- We both did.
- No.

466
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:20,380
Do it for your own reasons,
or don't do it.

467
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:25,180
- You don't know him.
- I know he didn't stop you.

468
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:27,340
And if you were mine...

469
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:33,140
...I wouldn't share you with anyone.

470
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:41,460
You have no right to judge David.

471
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:46,380
You're the one who has to buy women.

472
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:49,260
You think I have to buy women?

473
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:55,060
Why me, then?

474
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:58,620
I bought you because
you said you couldn't be bought.

475
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:02,220
I can't be bought.

476
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:04,580
We're just gonna fuck,
as I understand it.

477
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:08,220
You might enjoy it.

478
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:11,420
Don't bet on it.

479
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:16,260
I think I will.

480
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:24,820
Heads we do.
Tails we call the whole thing off.

481
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:27,740
Turn the boat around, go home.
No hard feelings.

482
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:30,700
What do you say?

483
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:33,700
It's your party.

484
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:40,300
It's my lucky dollar, so I can't lose.

485
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:02,780
Trust me.

486
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:07,020
Nothing's gonna happen
you don't choose.

487
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:18,380
- I love you.
- I love you.

488
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:35,340
<i>I told myself it was over,</i>

489
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:38,060
<i>like a dream that vanishes
in the morning light,</i>

490
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:42,340
<i>and in time, enough time,
I would forget.</i>

491
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:57,740
Yeah.

492
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:00,780
All right.

493
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:08,300
Yeah. A little fixer-upper
south of Wilshire. It's nothing.

494
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:10,100
Yeah.

495
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:12,300
Look, I've got people here.

496
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:14,500
I'll talk to you later.

497
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:17,580
Sorry. I'm here for you now.

498
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:20,220
All right. Two acres on Alta Loma...

499
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:23,780
- Alta Vista.
- That's right. Murphy property.

500
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:27,780
We've been a little late on
the payments. We want to settle up.

501
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:31,020
I don't think that's possible.

502
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:33,940
- What do you mean?
- The mortgage is two months in default

503
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:38,420
and it appears that the property
is in contract to another party.

504
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:42,820
- To another party? Who?
- That's privileged information.

505
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:45,620
How can that be? We called
specifically for an extension.

506
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:48,260
The extension expired two days ago.

507
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:51,340
If you don't make a payment,
the bank can repossess.

508
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:54,860
Without prior notice? Can they do that?

509
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:57,100
They don't have to give us a warning.

510
00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:00,140
But, in fact, an attempt was
made to call you on the 3rd.

511
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:03,860
A registered letter, return receipt
requested, was attempted on the 4th.

512
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:07,580
- Apparently there was no one home.
- We were out of town.

513
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:12,780
Well, I am sorry,
but you snooze, you lose.

514
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:16,500
"You snooze, you lose."

515
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:18,700
"You snooze, you lose"?

516
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:22,780
- It's an expression.
- That's beautiful.

517
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:25,660
That's bullshit!

518
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:28,220
This is bullshit, man!

519
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:32,860
Don't deal with these people! They
sold us out. They'll sell you out, too.

520
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:18,660
Wanna help me in the garden?

521
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:21,700
OK.

522
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:34,700
Our tomatoes are looking good,
don't you think?

523
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:38,180
David?

524
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:42,700
What's "Gryphonne"?

525
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:45,980
Gryphon.

526
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:49,260
Where did you hear that name?

527
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:53,260
You have a box of matches.

528
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:59,620
- We said we wouldn't talk about it.
- Yeah, well, now I want to talk about it.

529
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:03,780
Don't you?

530
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:04,820
- No.
- D.

531
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:12,420
I thought I could forget
about this, but I can't.

532
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:18,420
So I think maybe if we just talk about it,
we can put it behind us.

533
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:27,660
"Gryphon" is a boat.

534
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:30,100
He took you to a boat?

535
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:33,220
- In Nevada?
- We flew to Santa Barbara.

536
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:35,700
- What kind of boat?
- A big boat.

537
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:39,460
- And then what?
- And then nothing.

538
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:44,660
Where did you get the matches?
Were you going through my bag?

539
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:45,380
No!

540
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:50,860
Why? What's in your bag?

541
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:54,540
I'm not gonna talk about this.
I'm not gonna do it.

542
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:29,300
What?

543
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:34,780
- Who were you talking to?
- My mother.

544
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:38,060
And what did Mom have to say?

545
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:41,940
Nothing. She wasn't there.

546
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:46,060
You said you were just talking to her.
How could you be if she wasn't there?

547
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:50,180
Well, I was trying to talk to her,
but I didn't reach her.

548
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:52,900
- She wasn't in after ten o'clock?
- No, she's not.

549
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:56,940
If you don't believe me,
would you like to talk to her yourself?

550
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:01,740
What is the matter with you?

551
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:10,900
- What is that?
- You know what it is.

552
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:17,300
- Where did you get this?
- In your wallet.

553
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:18,740
I've never seen it.

554
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:22,460
It was in the secret compartment.
Have you been seeing him?

555
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:24,980
- No!
- You can't stop thinking about him.

556
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:26,540
You won't let me.

557
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:30,220
- Why did you look in my wallet?
- I don't trust you.

558
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:33,740
- You know, I don't trust you either.
- Well, then we're even.

559
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:44,500
<i>I had to do something.</i>

560
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:47,300
<i>I wanted to make something good
out of all we'd done wrong.</i>

561
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:51,180
<i>I decided to try and buy
our land back.</i>

562
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:53,780
OK. Alta Vista.

563
01:04:53,780 --> 01:04:57,900
I just need to find out the guy's name.
I wanna make him an offer.

564
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:02,260
- I'll get killed for this, Diana.
- I don't want you to get in trouble.

565
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:04,860
- 543 Alta Vista.
- There it is.

566
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:06,900
There it is right there. Back up.

567
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:10,140
Here we go. 543 Alta Vista.

568
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:15,380
This guy's never gonna sell, Diana.

569
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:18,020
I just saw this guy on TV!

570
01:05:56,740 --> 01:05:59,820
You bastard! You stole our property.

571
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:04,700
- I'd like to introduce a friend of mine...
- I'm not your friend.

572
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:07,340
- Diana advised me on some property...
- Bullshit!

573
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:10,980
- You took it and I want it back.
- I tell you what. Can we have...

574
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:14,100
That's OK. No, everything's fine.
Everything's under control.

575
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:18,260
Excuse me.

576
01:06:24,740 --> 01:06:26,700
I'm taking it off!

577
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:32,300
- Wait a minute...
- Why? Did you just wanna hurt me?

578
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:35,420
- No! I think you're wonderful.
- That was our house! How could you?

579
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:38,540
- I got there first.
- I want you to sell it back to me.

580
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:41,460
- You can't afford it.
- How's a million dollars?

581
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:45,100
- The price is two.
- If I had two, the price would be four.

582
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:47,300
Listen.
I saw an opportunity and took it.

583
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:51,340
You had the money and the right
instincts, but you were too late.

584
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:53,900
- I want you to work for me.
- Go to hell.

585
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:56,260
- Listen, I mean it.
- Never.

586
01:06:56,260 --> 01:06:58,140
Why not?

587
01:06:58,140 --> 01:07:00,740
- Because I hate you.
- No, you don't.

588
01:07:01,940 --> 01:07:04,420
You wish you hated me.

589
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:25,420
Hi, D.

590
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:31,260
You look awful.

591
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:35,780
- Where have you been?
- I'll tell you about it.

592
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:38,980
I'm just gonna have some wine first.

593
01:07:40,940 --> 01:07:42,900
Do you want some?

594
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:07,620
So where have you been?

595
01:08:11,940 --> 01:08:15,780
Last night I stayed up for hours,
trying to figure a way out of this mess.

596
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:20,820
And today?

597
01:08:23,620 --> 01:08:25,300
And today I saw Gage.

598
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:36,900
Thank you for your trust, David.
And for listening.

599
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:39,380
- Did you fuck him?
- No!

600
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:43,340
- But you wanted to, right?
- I met him in broad daylight, in public.

601
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:47,500
- I don't believe you.
- David, he bought our property.

602
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:52,500
That's why I went to see him. I just
wanted to find some way to get it back.

603
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:57,220
You have no reason to be jealous.
I hate him.

604
01:08:57,220 --> 01:08:59,500
- Tell me what happened on that boat.
- Don't do this!

605
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:01,460
Tell me what happened!

606
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:04,100
- Why?
- 'Cause I wanna know.

607
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:07,500
All right, I'll tell you.
The man was a fucking stallion.

608
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:10,380
Is that what you want me to say?
We did it all night.

609
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:13,220
- Is that the truth?
- You don't want the truth.

610
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:17,900
You want me to lie and say he's awful.
So I'll say it, and you won't believe me.

611
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:20,460
Just tell me the truth, D.

612
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:24,020
It was sex, David.
Just sex. Not love, just sex.

613
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:27,180
- Was it good sex?
- Don't do this, David.

614
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:30,140
Can you just tell me that, D?
Why are you hesitating?

615
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:33,420
Just tell me. Was it good?

616
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:35,660
Yes.

617
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:46,820
David.

618
01:09:50,260 --> 01:09:55,900
D, don't tell me it was just sex.
You were attracted to him all along.

619
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:59,180
That's bullshit.
David, I did it for you.

620
01:09:59,180 --> 01:10:04,100
Don't tell me you did it for me. You did it
for yourself. You were dying to do it.

621
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:07,580
It's a lie. I would never do this
for myself. It was all for you.

622
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:11,140
Don't lie to me!
You were attracted to him!

623
01:11:09,620 --> 01:11:12,100
I knew something like this
was gonna happen.

624
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:17,260
I guess you make a deal with the devil,
and eventually you pay the price.

625
01:11:17,260 --> 01:11:21,100
Thanks. From the man
who closed the deal with the devil,

626
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:23,660
that's very comforting.

627
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:26,900
Green.

628
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:30,820
- Hi, Di.
- I'm not here.

629
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:34,660
Yeah, he's right here.
You wanna speak to him?

630
01:11:34,660 --> 01:11:38,340
<i>- No, I don't wanna talk to him.
- Look, sweetie.</i>

631
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:41,740
He loves you. You love him.

632
01:11:41,740 --> 01:11:45,100
You gotta try and work this out.
It's pretty simple.

633
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:49,540
<i>- This is a deal even I can't screw up.
- Tell him he can keep the money.</i>

634
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:53,500
I don't want any of it.

635
01:12:01,340 --> 01:12:04,780
Davey? She says she
doesn't want the money.

636
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:07,660
I don't want the money either.

637
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:20,980
I'll take it.
I mean, if nobody else wants it.

638
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:45,180
- Hi.
- Hi, Diana.

639
01:12:58,740 --> 01:13:02,580
<i>The next few weeks without David
felt like months.</i>

640
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:05,580
<i>I got very good at staring at walls.</i>

641
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:09,420
Diana, Diana.

642
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:10,980
The recession has ended.

643
01:13:10,980 --> 01:13:15,020
There's a fella out there
wants to see $10 million homes.

644
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:17,380
There is a god.

645
01:13:20,940 --> 01:13:22,260
Find someone else.

646
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:28,260
Are you nuts? Do you know what
the commission is on $10 million?

647
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:30,460
- I can't do it.
- You have to do it.

648
01:13:30,460 --> 01:13:32,700
You're the best one I have.

649
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:36,580
You're the only one I have.
The others are all on caravan.

650
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:44,660
I'm sorry, Mr Langford. I can't.

651
01:13:44,660 --> 01:13:49,540
I would never dream of forcing you
to do anything against your will.

652
01:13:50,540 --> 01:13:52,460
Except this one time.

653
01:13:53,980 --> 01:13:57,020
Now move your ass or you're fired.

654
01:14:02,620 --> 01:14:06,220
If you think this is gonna work,
you underestimate me.

655
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:32,820
You are truly beautiful.

656
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:36,380
What do you think you're doing?

657
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:40,460
Looking for a house.

658
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:47,540
There's Bel Air, Benedict Canyon,
Pacific Palisades.

659
01:14:47,540 --> 01:14:50,700
- Where would you like to go first?
- Paris.

660
01:14:52,540 --> 01:14:55,300
1120 Bel Air Road, please.

661
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:08,060
The ceilings are French Gothic.
Renaissance paintings, as you can see.

662
01:15:08,060 --> 01:15:10,100
Parquet floors throughout.

663
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:11,980
The bathrooms are Italian marble.

664
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:15,180
This is the master bath.

665
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:20,980
Why didn't you return my calls?

666
01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:23,460
Do you like it?

667
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:26,100
No.

668
01:15:38,020 --> 01:15:39,860
- 30 million minimum.
- You think?

669
01:15:39,860 --> 01:15:41,940
- I know.
- Let's look at it.

670
01:15:41,940 --> 01:15:45,580
- It's not for sale.
- Everything's for sale.

671
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:17,540
This is your house, isn't it?

672
01:16:19,340 --> 01:16:20,900
Do you like it?

673
01:16:26,020 --> 01:16:29,300
Well, it's certainly beautiful.

674
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:32,220
What do you think it needs?

675
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:34,340
Tell me. Honestly.

676
01:16:37,220 --> 01:16:39,660
I think it needs a life.

677
01:16:40,620 --> 01:16:45,660
I think it needs furniture and
maybe a couple of dogs and flowers.

678
01:16:45,660 --> 01:16:47,700
It needs you.

679
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:54,100
Just forget it. This just won't work.

680
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:55,780
Why not?

681
01:16:57,180 --> 01:17:00,380
Because from where we've started
we've got nowhere to go.

682
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:02,420
You don't know that.

683
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:05,860
I've never started this way either.

684
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:11,300
I need you.

685
01:17:14,620 --> 01:17:15,340
No.

686
01:17:16,540 --> 01:17:18,660
You collect things.

687
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:23,380
Don't you?

688
01:17:24,660 --> 01:17:26,500
Sometimes.

689
01:17:32,020 --> 01:17:33,220
Yeah.

690
01:18:35,940 --> 01:18:41,260
Even if you were extremely rich
and smart can you be president?

691
01:18:41,260 --> 01:18:44,980
- No.
- You couldn't be president? Why not?

692
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:50,420
<i>I took a second job teaching
citizenship, just to keep myself busy.</i>

693
01:18:52,020 --> 01:18:54,540
Ju, where were you born?

694
01:18:54,540 --> 01:18:56,940
I was born in Seoul, Korea.

695
01:18:56,940 --> 01:19:02,980
- OK, where was she born?
- She was born in Seoul, Korea.

696
01:19:03,540 --> 01:19:07,220
<i>That drug dealer, he is the president.</i>

697
01:19:07,220 --> 01:19:09,860
<i>In my country he could be both.</i>

698
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:13,060
Where were you born, Miguel?

699
01:19:13,060 --> 01:19:16,780
- Sorry.
- Welcome back.

700
01:19:16,780 --> 01:19:20,660
- Where were you born?
- Cuba.

701
01:19:20,660 --> 01:19:24,420
So, how do we say "Cuba"
in America?

702
01:19:24,420 --> 01:19:26,540
Cuba.

703
01:19:27,380 --> 01:19:30,180
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

704
01:19:30,180 --> 01:19:33,420
- Isn't this the citizenship class?
- Yes.

705
01:19:33,420 --> 01:19:36,660
- Can I sit in?
- It's full.

706
01:19:45,860 --> 01:19:48,460
- Cuba.
- Thank you.

707
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:05,300
OK, um...

708
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:07,140
I have a question for you.

709
01:20:07,740 --> 01:20:11,060
Excuse me. Is there something
you'd like to share with us?

710
01:20:11,580 --> 01:20:14,380
I was just saying
that you're an amazing woman.

711
01:20:18,260 --> 01:20:21,220
And beautiful.

712
01:20:23,260 --> 01:20:25,700
And talented.

713
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:28,180
And I am crazy about her.

714
01:20:37,580 --> 01:20:41,260
- You're full of surprises, aren't you?
- I'm trying like hell.

715
01:20:42,020 --> 01:20:44,700
- You should go.
- You want me to go?

716
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:45,420
No!

717
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:54,420
Nice people. They want the Dream.

718
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:57,460
Well, they saw it in the flesh tonight.

719
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:02,860
You have chalk on your face.

720
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:07,660
I have something I wanna show you.

721
01:21:21,220 --> 01:21:24,620
I didn't know whether
you like big ones or little ones.

722
01:21:26,940 --> 01:21:30,300
You're so beautiful. Come here.

723
01:21:32,820 --> 01:21:36,500
I didn't have much time
to do anything else.

724
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:40,980
But it's a start.

725
01:21:53,740 --> 01:21:54,420
Dance?

726
01:21:57,860 --> 01:21:59,940
I should go.

727
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:06,220
I remember once when I was young,

728
01:22:06,220 --> 01:22:09,060
and I was coming back from
a movie or something,

729
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:11,140
I was on the subway.

730
01:22:13,260 --> 01:22:16,340
There was a girl sitting across from me.

731
01:22:16,340 --> 01:22:22,180
She was wearing this dress that
was buttoned clear up right to here.

732
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:28,620
She was the most beautiful thing
I'd ever seen.

733
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:33,340
And I was shy then.

734
01:22:33,340 --> 01:22:36,580
So when she would look at me,

735
01:22:36,580 --> 01:22:38,620
I would look away.

736
01:22:40,140 --> 01:22:42,900
Then, afterwards,
when I would look back,

737
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:45,140
she would look away.

738
01:22:46,580 --> 01:22:52,500
Then I got to where I was gonna get
off, and got off. The doors closed.

739
01:22:54,340 --> 01:22:59,660
And as the train was pulling away,
she looked right at me

740
01:22:59,660 --> 01:23:02,380
and gave me the most incredible smile.

741
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:09,300
It was awful.
I wanted to tear the doors open.

742
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:14,180
I went back every night,
same time, for two weeks.

743
01:23:17,140 --> 01:23:19,700
But she never showed up.

744
01:23:21,460 --> 01:23:23,660
That was 30 years ago.

745
01:23:24,820 --> 01:23:29,380
And I don't think there's a day
that goes by that I don't think about her.

746
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:34,300
I don't want that to happen again.

747
01:23:40,420 --> 01:23:42,060
Just one dance?

748
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:07,020
You wanted the driver's side...

749
01:27:07,900 --> 01:27:10,060
I want a word with you, Gage.

750
01:27:10,060 --> 01:27:13,940
What you don't know is
we got a secret, me and Diana.

751
01:27:13,940 --> 01:27:15,380
We're invincible.

752
01:27:16,860 --> 01:27:20,340
- Diana, I need to talk...
- Tomorrow might be a better time.

753
01:27:20,340 --> 01:27:22,620
Tomorrow might be better, you think?

754
01:27:22,620 --> 01:27:24,700
Johnny-baby,
I got a suggestion for you.

755
01:27:24,700 --> 01:27:29,700
You know that emblem you got?
The gryphon? The eagle?

756
01:27:29,700 --> 01:27:33,740
I don't think it's a good idea.
I got a better idea.

757
01:27:33,740 --> 01:27:38,780
How about the cuckoo? Because...
I'm talking to you for a second.

758
01:27:38,780 --> 01:27:41,940
The cuckoo is interesting.
It doesn't have its own nest,

759
01:27:41,940 --> 01:27:45,700
so it moves into the nest of other birds
and destroys their eggs.

760
01:27:45,700 --> 01:27:47,300
David, stop.

761
01:27:50,500 --> 01:27:52,580
You don't love me any more?

762
01:27:57,580 --> 01:28:00,540
Have I ever told you I love you?

763
01:28:04,580 --> 01:28:06,980
Have a nice dinner.

764
01:28:08,740 --> 01:28:10,700
- Help him.
- Here.

765
01:28:12,140 --> 01:28:13,700
Go inside.

766
01:28:13,700 --> 01:28:16,500
You got him?

767
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:18,900
D.

768
01:30:40,940 --> 01:30:44,260
You've done a lot since USC.

769
01:30:44,260 --> 01:30:48,300
First in your class. AIA award.

770
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:51,740
- Prix de Rome.
- Yeah.

771
01:30:53,140 --> 01:30:55,820
Why would you want this job?

772
01:30:55,820 --> 01:30:58,900
Well, I wanna work.

773
01:31:02,420 --> 01:31:04,140
Overqualified.

774
01:31:04,660 --> 01:31:07,060
Fine. Exploit me.

775
01:31:41,620 --> 01:31:44,220
Great architecture
only comes from your passion,

776
01:31:44,220 --> 01:31:46,540
and even that won't assure you a job.

777
01:31:46,540 --> 01:31:49,100
Louis Kahn.

778
01:31:49,100 --> 01:31:53,260
Died in a men's room in Penn Station.
For days, no one claimed the body.

779
01:31:53,260 --> 01:31:55,100
Look at that. Is that beautiful?

780
01:31:55,100 --> 01:31:57,340
The money men did not weep,

781
01:31:57,340 --> 01:32:00,100
because the great ones
are impossible to deal with.

782
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:05,100
They're a pain in the ass, because they
know that if they do their jobs properly,

783
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:07,500
if they just this once get it right,

784
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:11,980
they can actually lift the human spirit,
take it to a higher place.

785
01:32:17,180 --> 01:32:19,660
- What is this?
- A brick.

786
01:32:21,100 --> 01:32:23,340
Good. What else?

787
01:32:23,340 --> 01:32:25,300
A weapon.

788
01:32:28,420 --> 01:32:32,620
Louis Kahn said, "Even a brick
wants to be something."

789
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:43,020
A brick wants to be something.

790
01:32:45,180 --> 01:32:47,060
It aspires.

791
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:58,220
Even a common, ordinary brick
wants to be something more than it is.

792
01:33:03,220 --> 01:33:06,860
Wants to be something better than it is.

793
01:33:14,420 --> 01:33:16,460
That is what we must be.

794
01:33:20,140 --> 01:33:22,380
See you on Friday.

795
01:33:32,980 --> 01:33:36,540
A brick wants to be something?
I bet it doesn't want to be a lawyer.

796
01:33:36,540 --> 01:33:39,020
- What are you doing here?
- I missed you.

797
01:33:39,620 --> 01:33:42,660
- I missed you, too.
- Thanks.

798
01:33:47,380 --> 01:33:49,780
- How you doin'?
- I'm good.

799
01:33:49,780 --> 01:33:51,860
I'm getting it together.

800
01:33:57,100 --> 01:33:58,980
She wants a divorce.

801
01:34:01,860 --> 01:34:04,020
She wants her freedom.

802
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:09,060
If you don't contest it,
you get everything.

803
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:12,500
The land, the money. Everything.

804
01:34:13,460 --> 01:34:15,220
Where is she?

805
01:34:23,580 --> 01:34:26,780
Hi, everybody. I'm Billy Connolly.
Goodbye, everybody.

806
01:34:26,780 --> 01:34:30,540
You may wonder what you're doing
here, sitting in the blazing sun,

807
01:34:30,540 --> 01:34:34,140
as the smell of the zoo
wafts past your nostrils.

808
01:34:34,140 --> 01:34:37,860
The reason you are here
is because you are loaded.

809
01:34:37,860 --> 01:34:40,460
May I say how brilliant it is
to see so many people

810
01:34:40,460 --> 01:34:43,660
with an interest in the preservation
of endangered species.

811
01:34:43,660 --> 01:34:47,020
Every year, we have this unique way
of making money for the cause.

812
01:34:47,020 --> 01:34:50,580
We auction animals.
We bid as high as we possibly can,

813
01:34:50,580 --> 01:34:53,180
and the money goes
to sponsor these lovely beasts.

814
01:34:53,180 --> 01:34:57,540
Let's start the show with a bang. We've
got a superstar as our first animal.

815
01:34:57,540 --> 01:35:00,820
Ladies and gentlemen, the hippo.

816
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:04,580
The animal itself
is far too big and angry to bring along.

817
01:35:04,580 --> 01:35:08,140
Look at this guy.
Thousands and thousands of pounds

818
01:35:08,140 --> 01:35:11,100
of aggressive, hostile cellulite.

819
01:35:11,100 --> 01:35:14,060
Weighs slightly less
than the average school bus.

820
01:35:14,060 --> 01:35:16,740
And look at that magnificent beastie.

821
01:35:16,740 --> 01:35:21,700
To put him in a better light,
to relieve you of some serious money...

822
01:35:21,700 --> 01:35:23,940
Thank you very much.

823
01:35:23,940 --> 01:35:26,380
...we have a kissy-kissy picture.

824
01:35:27,460 --> 01:35:29,500
Isn't that nice?

825
01:35:32,100 --> 01:35:36,820
Ladies and gentlemen, I couldn't dream
of starting the bid below $10,000.

826
01:35:36,820 --> 01:35:39,180
- Now, I know it's a lot of money...
- 30.

827
01:35:39,180 --> 01:35:42,980
$30,000, ladies and gentlemen!

828
01:35:44,140 --> 01:35:48,540
Call me a sentimental old fool,
do I hear 35?

829
01:35:48,540 --> 01:35:51,420
- 35.
- $35,000!

830
01:35:51,420 --> 01:35:53,980
- 40.
- $40,000!

831
01:35:53,980 --> 01:35:54,780
45,000.

832
01:35:56,380 --> 01:35:59,620
- 50.
- $50,000.

833
01:36:00,660 --> 01:36:04,660
I can't believe it. That's extraordinary.
50,000 once,

834
01:36:04,660 --> 01:36:07,940
50,000 twice, ladies and gentlemen...

835
01:36:07,940 --> 01:36:10,660
One million dollars.

836
01:36:16,380 --> 01:36:17,740
I'm sorry?

837
01:36:17,740 --> 01:36:20,020
One million dollars.

838
01:36:22,420 --> 01:36:25,060
Did you say one million dollars, sir?

839
01:36:25,060 --> 01:36:26,700
Yeah.

840
01:36:26,700 --> 01:36:30,260
Ladies and gentlemen,
one million dollars.

841
01:36:31,620 --> 01:36:35,180
Would anybody care to top that,
ladies and gentlemen?

842
01:36:35,180 --> 01:36:36,540
I didn't think so.

843
01:36:36,540 --> 01:36:39,900
In that case, sir, I believe you're
the proud owner of a hippo.

844
01:36:39,900 --> 01:36:41,580
Congratulations.

845
01:36:54,980 --> 01:36:57,500
Hello, Diana.

846
01:36:57,500 --> 01:36:59,340
The next animal to take the stand
is an ostrich...

847
01:36:59,340 --> 01:37:01,540
I really wanted you to have that money.

848
01:37:01,540 --> 01:37:04,020
I really wanted you to have that hippo.

849
01:37:07,860 --> 01:37:10,980
Maybe you two would like
a moment alone.

850
01:37:24,100 --> 01:37:25,780
So...

851
01:37:28,660 --> 01:37:30,340
- How are you...
- I hear you're teaching...

852
01:37:30,340 --> 01:37:33,140
- Sorry.
- Go ahead.

853
01:37:33,140 --> 01:37:35,540
Yeah. I'm teaching.

854
01:37:37,820 --> 01:37:42,460
You know, it doesn't pay much, but
at least I get to talk about architecture.

855
01:37:42,460 --> 01:37:45,860
You know how I love
to talk about architecture.

856
01:37:47,540 --> 01:37:50,820
Don't leave, ladies and gentlemen.
It's just a shower.

857
01:37:50,820 --> 01:37:54,100
A cheque book
makes an ideal umbrella.

858
01:37:54,100 --> 01:37:57,260
Do we have a dolphin?
Have we a dolphin and an octopus?

859
01:37:57,260 --> 01:37:59,340
How about tropical fish?

860
01:37:59,340 --> 01:38:02,300
I know. You're running home
for more cash.

861
01:38:02,300 --> 01:38:05,860
Come on, ladies and gentlemen.
You can find the money.

862
01:38:05,860 --> 01:38:08,340
To hell. I'm gone.

863
01:38:17,300 --> 01:38:19,500
I have to talk to you
about what happened.

864
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:22,140
- Don't.
- No. I have to.

865
01:38:22,140 --> 01:38:24,940
Just hear me out.

866
01:38:27,100 --> 01:38:30,220
I think the mistake I made in Vegas

867
01:38:30,220 --> 01:38:34,380
was thinking that I could
forget what we did.

868
01:38:35,660 --> 01:38:38,660
I thought we were invincible.

869
01:38:39,700 --> 01:38:45,420
Now I know that the things that people
in love do to each other, they remember.

870
01:38:45,420 --> 01:38:48,740
And if they stay together,
it's not because they forget,

871
01:38:48,740 --> 01:38:50,740
it's because they forgive.

872
01:38:57,420 --> 01:38:59,300
I was just...

873
01:39:02,140 --> 01:39:05,420
I was just so afraid
that you wanted him.

874
01:39:06,420 --> 01:39:09,420
No, actually, I was afraid
you were right to want him.

875
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:17,780
I thought he was the better man.

876
01:39:22,660 --> 01:39:27,660
And I know now he's not.
He's just got more money.

877
01:40:56,500 --> 01:40:58,300
I think we should talk.

878
01:40:59,180 --> 01:41:01,060
I am very happy.

879
01:41:02,460 --> 01:41:06,100
Shackleford,
have you ever seen me like this?

880
01:41:07,380 --> 01:41:09,620
Can't say that I have.

881
01:41:09,620 --> 01:41:13,580
- Diana's the reason.
- Enough for any man.

882
01:41:13,580 --> 01:41:17,620
She is the best of them. Absolutely.

883
01:41:18,780 --> 01:41:20,500
You are the best of them.

884
01:41:21,940 --> 01:41:23,940
"The best of them"?

885
01:41:23,940 --> 01:41:26,500
You said I'm the best of them?

886
01:41:26,500 --> 01:41:28,460
You are.

887
01:41:31,020 --> 01:41:32,660
I don't understand.

888
01:41:34,260 --> 01:41:37,100
Shackleford,
could you explain it to her?

889
01:41:37,100 --> 01:41:38,660
What?

890
01:41:39,980 --> 01:41:42,660
I could do that, sir.

891
01:41:42,660 --> 01:41:46,220
But I feel Ms Murphy
would rather hear it from you.

892
01:41:46,220 --> 01:41:48,980
OK. All right.

893
01:41:48,980 --> 01:41:52,740
She's the best of
the million-dollar club. Obviously.

894
01:41:56,020 --> 01:41:59,340
- "Million-dollar club"?
- Now you've got it.

895
01:42:01,180 --> 01:42:02,700
You told me you'd
never done that before.

896
01:42:02,700 --> 01:42:05,300
How many members
would you say there are?

897
01:42:06,140 --> 01:42:08,100
- Members?
- Yeah.

898
01:42:09,580 --> 01:42:12,060
- Worldwide?
- Yeah.

899
01:42:13,820 --> 01:42:15,300
I think a couple of dozen.

900
01:42:16,780 --> 01:42:19,260
Remember the one
that wouldn't stop hiccuping?

901
01:42:19,260 --> 01:42:22,260
- What?
- The waitress from Oklahoma.

902
01:42:22,260 --> 01:42:25,740
Every time you came near her,
she would convulse in hiccups.

903
01:42:27,740 --> 01:42:31,540
Yeah. I had forgotten. Quite a night.

904
01:42:33,540 --> 01:42:38,820
The best thing of it is that
you know if you're sexually compatible

905
01:42:38,820 --> 01:42:41,100
right from the start.

906
01:42:51,220 --> 01:42:53,700
Shackleford, would you stop the car?

907
01:43:22,100 --> 01:43:23,980
Thank you, John.

908
01:43:27,860 --> 01:43:29,060
Goodbye.

909
01:43:30,180 --> 01:43:32,220
Goodbye.

910
01:43:38,460 --> 01:43:40,140
Here.

911
01:43:43,900 --> 01:43:45,300
For luck.

912
01:43:53,620 --> 01:43:55,540
- Take care of him.
- Sure.

913
01:44:04,180 --> 01:44:06,420
What was all that about?

914
01:44:08,220 --> 01:44:10,540
I wanted to end it.

915
01:44:14,300 --> 01:44:17,740
She never would have looked
at me the way she did at him.

916
01:45:06,740 --> 01:45:10,660
<i>Seven years ago, David proposed
to me at Paradise Cove.</i>

917
01:45:11,940 --> 01:45:16,540
<i>I wanted to go there to remember
and start over.</i>

918
01:46:19,980 --> 01:46:23,020
Have I ever told you I love you?

919
01:46:32,060 --> 01:46:32,780
No.

920
01:46:37,660 --> 01:46:39,620
I do.

921
01:46:44,660 --> 01:46:46,220
Still?

922
01:46:50,220 --> 01:46:51,980
Always.
