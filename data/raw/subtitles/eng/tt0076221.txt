Oh. there's another little one.

18
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:41,348
- Fifteen.
- What are you doing out there. Dennis?

19
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,446
Stocktaking. Father.

20
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:46,651
- I thought you took stock this morning.
- Oh. M. I did.

21
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:49,593
But it never hurts to keep an
up—to-the-moment account of your stock.

22
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,596
In business nowadays. Father—

23
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:55,464
Never mind that nonsense
and come and help me with this cask.

24
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:58,629
All right. Father.
I'll ﬁnish stocktaking later.

25
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:06,809
See. the secret of the craft
is to keep the stake—

26
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:10,611
Take hold of the hoop.

27
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,186
Hello. Dennis. Ralph.

28
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:21,052
Good day. Mr. Fishﬁnger. Can I be
of some assistance to you today?

29
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:23,288
- Well—
- Oh. Dennis. what are you—

30
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,463
Yes. well. see.
I need some barrels. Dennis...

31
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:32,265
for shipping dried ﬁsh
to the city.

32
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:35,603
Big demand there. you know.
since this monster scare.

33
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:38,166
My goodness.
prices going up all the time.

34
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:40,906
That's great. that's great
But tell me. Mr. Fishﬁnger...

35
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,313
do you believe all these stories
about whole villages being destroyed?

36
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:47,649
Well. I haven't actually seen
the monster myself". you know.

37
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,382
But when I was over
in Muckley the other day—

38
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,822
Muckley?
That's quite a ways. isn't it?

39
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:54,883
It's two mile or more. easy.

40
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:58,425
Gosh. I'd like to travel someday.
Mr. Fishﬁnger.

41
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:01,166
- Anyway. about the monster—
- Oh. yes.

42
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:04,431
Well. this gmin merchant.
you see. over in Muckley...

43
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:08,270
he claimed
that he'd actually seen it.

44
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:14,603
Turned his teeth snow white
overnight. they say.

45
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:22,710
- Anyway. about the barrels—
- Yes. well. must be cheap.

46
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,723
First of all. cheap.
Must be cheap.

47
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,521

 thinkwe can attend to your needs.
Mr. Fishﬁnger.

48
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:30,858
Exactly how inapensive?

49
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,358
- No more than tuppence apiece.
- Tuppence?

50
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:37,596
What are you talking about.
Fishﬁnger?

51
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:41,037
I can't turn out a decent barrel
for that price. and you know it.

52
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:44,440
- Look. Father. don't you think—
- Ralph. let's be sensible.

53
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,944
See. the barrels have only got
to last until they get to the city.

54
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,947
- It's easy money.
- Nol

55
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:53,816
I don't make barrels to last
two or three days. Fishﬁnger.

56
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:56,946

 make barrels to last a lifetime.
I'm a craftsman!

57
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:00,618
-We know. Everybody knows.
-
t's something you'll never understand.

58
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,662
Oryou either. Dennis. I'm aflaid.

59
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,665
You don't want barrels.
You want bags.

60
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:07,893
_ 
_
- Now get out!

61
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:09,901
- Look. Father—
- Out!

62
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:11,994
And don't come back here
with your shoddy deals.

63
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:15,837
- Yes. Good-bye.
- Tuppence!

64
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:19,309
- I'm sorry. Mr. Fishﬁnger. I'm sorry.
- It's all right. Dennis.

65
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,507
He's given me a very good idea.

66
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,484
Wait. Mr. Fishﬁnger!

 think—l think I can get—

67
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:27,917
Bye. Dennis.

68
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:30,649
Tuppence!

69
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:44,068
Griselda.

70
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:46,430
Griselda.

71
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:49,873
- Yeah?
- It is I. Dennis...

72
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:52,274
- come to see you.
-

73
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:56,008
How are you. my love?

74
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,681
- Have you missed me?
- What?

75
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,221
Oh. Griselda.
it's lovely to see you again.

76
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:05,655
I think about you all day long
when I'm taking stock.

77
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:08,523
I dream of the day when
I'll ask for your hand in marriage...

78
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,687
and we'll build
that little cottage.

79
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:14,164
I'll come home from the shop.
We'll have supper together. Hey. Roger!

80
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:17,225
Roger. what are you doing?
Well. just a— You—

81
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:19,271
What?

82
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:26,136
Oh. Griselda. Sorry.

83
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:31,205
I know I can't ask you
to declare your love for me...

84
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,185
till I'm in a better position to
marry you. but say you'll wait for me.

85
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:37,848
- Say I've got a chance—
- Let go!

86
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:41,121
- Why. Griselda. why?
- I've gotta scratch.

87
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:47,923
Oh. sorry. Dennis.
Hovifs your father?

88
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,025
Oh. never better.
Mrs. Fishﬁnger.

89
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:56,335
- Is that Dennis Copper?
- Yes.

90
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,507
Hello. Dennis.
You've got garbage all over your vest.

91
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:07,183
You really ought to look after your
appearance. Very bad for business.

92
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:09,721
Oh. by the way.
I thought you'd like to know...

93
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:14,021
I got Wat the Mercer to run me up
a few cloth bags— only a ha'penny each.

94
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:17,529

 wish I could’ve convinced Father
to see it your way. Mr. Fishﬁnger.

95
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:21,192
Yes. well. you see. a man's
got to move with the times.

96
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:24,998
When you take over the shop. no doubt
we'll do a lot of business together.

97
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:27,801
Oh. that won't be for some time yet.
Mr. Fishﬁ nger.

98
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:32,242
Oh. well. it's getting late.
I'd better be going.

99
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,939
Okay by me.

100
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,812
Drop in any time. Dennis.

101
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:39,818
Good-bye. Griselda.

102
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:07,111
m

103
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:17,385
Is that you. Dennis?

104
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:19,481
Yes. Father.

105
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:24,121
- Come closer. Dennis.
- Yes. Father.

106
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:32,199
- What happened?
- It's my heart.

107
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,240
I haven't long.

108
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:40,002
l'm going— I'm going to—

109
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,013
Throw up?

110
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,514
No.

111
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:48,544
- Father.
- Son.

112
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:52,318
What shall I do without your
guiding hand. without your skill?

113
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:56,127
- Son.
- Yes. Father?

114
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:58,629
I'll tell you...

115
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:02,464
you're going to end up
just like that...

116
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,869
Fishﬁnger.

117
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,374
Who. me?

118
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:14,811
Father.
 know Mr. Fishﬁnger's
a very successful businessman. but—

119
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:20,511
Because you've got
no understanding...

120
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:23,646
of craftsmanship...

121
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:28,717
no appreciation
of the beauty of wood

122
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:32,864
because you'rejust a shallow...

123
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:35,724
dull. pretentious...

124
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,234

125
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,739
little stock-taker!

126
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,536
Oh. Father. you're delirious.

127
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:45,076
You don't know what you're saying.

128
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:48,375
Oh. yes. I do. you—
you whimpering...

129
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,438
snotty-nosed...

130
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:53,076
cretinous oal!

131
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:58,853
- I've wanted to say this for years.
- Father. we're not alone.

132
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:02,018
You're everything I despise!

133
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:04,426
Dad's raving. I'm aflaid.

134
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,931
No. he's not.

You and your kind will drive good.

136
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:14,937
Do you hear?
To the wall!

137
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,373
Honestly. Dad. I was only trying
to improve the business.

138
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:22,179
You won't have my business...

139
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:25,217
to improve anymore.

140
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:27,684
Not my cooperage.

141
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:31,245
Because I'm taking it with me!

142
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:33,382
- Dad. I don't understand.
- Don't understand?

143
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:37,054
You damned ninny. I'm renouncing you.
You're no son of mine.

144
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:39,461
You're no craftsman's son.

145
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:43,127
Get out. out of my sight!

146
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:46,899

- Yes. sir. Can I speak to Griselda?

150
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:24,735
She's eating. Dennis.
What do you want?

151
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:28,041
I'm going away. Mr. Fishﬁnger.
I'm going to the city.

152
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:31,675
And I'm going to make good and I'm gonna
come back and claim Griselda's hand.

153
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,844
So you will. Dennis.
Good-bye.

154
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:40,492
Griselda. I'm going away.
Say something. Say anything.

00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:44,791
- Pass the potatoes.
- I heard that! You are in there.

156
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:48,322
Mydarling. I'm going away.
I may not even see you—

157
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:50,834
That's rotten!

158
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:58,232
For me?
Griselda. you do care.

159
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:03,247
A keepsake. something that
will always remind me ofyou.

160
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:07,149
Oh. Griselda. I'll carry this nut to
my heart until the day when we nut...

161
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,153

169
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,333
Good morning. Passelevve.

170
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:06,030
- Good morning to you. sir.
- And to you. sir. A ﬁne day.

171
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:08,972
Truly. Your business goes well.
I trust.

172
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,635
One doesn't like to complain.
And your own commercial efforts?

173
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,270
Oh. one does one's best. you know.

174
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:16,439
I understand you're
opening a new shop.

175
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:19,279
Yes. down by the town gate.
It's an area of considerable growth.

176
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:22,843
Oh. I agree. I trust we'll be
hearing ﬁ'om you with an order soon.

177
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,483
Oh. certainly.
That is. if your prices are competitive.

178
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:29,493
- Surely.
- What's the latest wine-to-water ratio?

179
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:32,121
- Did you see it this morning?
- Yes. it camejust as I left the house.

180
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:35,792
It's two wine to one water still. but I
don't see how it can hold at that rate.

181
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,836
Theyre very lucky to be getting
any wine at all. you know.

182
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:42,863
Is that all? I thought I detected a
certain oneness in the last consignment.

183
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:46,207
Oh. that's odd. It was very robust
when it left my premises.

184
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,939
Get a move on.

185
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:51,449
Let me send you a sample of our new
shipment of port with my compliments.

186
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:55,078
Move it. you lame buggers.
That would be most kind of you.

187
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:57,418
Why do you suppose the king
has called this council?

188
00:15:57,489 --> 00:16:00,083
Only the Lord knows.
Get going. you!

189
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,127
But I have heard the chamberlain
is urging him...

190
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:03,661
to take measures
against the monster.

191
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:07,096
Measures? That would allow
the peasants to leave the city?

192
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:11,603
It could very well be. And that would
not be good for business. Move it!

193
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,867
Come on!
Get a move on!

194
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:45,634
- After you.
- No. you ﬁrst. please.

195
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:47,638
You're too kind.

196
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:41,616
Attention!
Our Most Glorious Majesty...

197
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:44,161
lGng Bruno the Questionable.

198
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:54,433
Son of Olaf the Loud.

199
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:57,031
Oh. he's coming!
He's coming!

200
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,043
I'm not ﬁnished yet.

201
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:01,545
Oh. look out!
He's here!

202
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,556
Pay attention. Your Majesty.

203
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:14,820
Surely you must see
it's a matter of the gravest urgency.

204
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:17,794
- Yes. yes. of course. Passelevve.
-jesus Christ!

205
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:22,360
Quick. sire. down!

206
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:28,498
Stop it!

207
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:31,070
Come on.

208
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:36,013
Bless my soul!

209
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:41,018
Great grandnephew...

210
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:43,884
of Emperor Otto the Bent...

211
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:48,587

of Freedonia.

213
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:55,797
Let him go!
Get up. man.

214
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:58,928
Silly thing.
You'll get your rags all dirty.

215
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:02,936
Sire. help us. sire.

216
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:05,875
The monster is ravaging
the countryside.

217
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:10,381
It has destroyed our homes.
We haven't eaten in days.

218
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:11,939
- Weeks.
- Months.

219
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:14,884
_ Except—
- I ate my shoe yesterday.

220
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:19,686
Oh. that's nothing.
late three toes offofmy right foot.

221
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:22,727
- Terrible monster—
- That ain't your right foot.

222
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:25,285
Know-it-all!
Are you a doctor or something?

223
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:27,730
- Please—
- I saw a doctor once.

224
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:30,632
He didn't see me.
I was hiding.

225
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:34,900
Your Majesty.
save us ﬁ'om the great green beast.

226
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:38,306

00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:41,312
- No. it were more orange.
- No. it was grajd

228
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:48,579
Now stop it.
Stop it. all of you!

229
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:50,815
Go on. get out. get out!

230
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:53,153
What are you doing?
Go on. get out!

231
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:55,557
I'll read this to the king.

232
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:57,561
- Stop it!
- Go on!

233
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,866
You know. it seems to me.
Passelewe...

234
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:04,664
that my subjects are
becoming a pain in the arse.

235
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:07,432
Yes. well. my dear.
you must do something.

236
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:09,872
I mean. your kingdom
is paralyzed with fear.

237
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:12,103
The city below
is overﬂowing with refugees.

238
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:14,577
Theyre simple people
and easy prey...

239
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:17,171
for every sharp-witted merchant
and trickster.

240
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:21,652

of Lowndes Wctor. Savior of Wales.

_ He)!
- And king.

242
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:52,950
Your Majesty. your council
meets today in solemn session...

243
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:56,818
to urgently discuss
the terrible havoc-

244
00:20:56,888 --> 00:21:00,790
mealredhythemanster
all over the country/stile.

245
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:04,351
Look. I'm telling you. nobody gets
in here without money or possessions.

246
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,363
But I've got possessions.

247
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,161
- See?
- That's only a rock.

248
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:10,861
- Only a rock?
- Yeah.

249
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:14,736
Listen. what if this
is notjust an ordinary rock?

250
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:18,037
What if this is a diamond?

251
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,874
It don't shine.
Now get out of here!

252
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,216
Right. nut.

253
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:28,811
Now. what have you got?
Any grain? Any cloth?

254
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:32,721
No. I haven't got anything. really. but
it's important that I get in the city.

255
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,021
That's what they all say.
Now move along.

256
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:38,654
No. you don't understand. I've come to
get ajob. I'm starting all over again.

257
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,528
l've got lots of good ideas. I think
that. once in there. I could have—

258
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,401
Now look. sonny. shove off. eh?
Wait a minute! What have you got here?

259
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,132
What's this?

260
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:52,768
You told us you had nothing.

261
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:55,711
- That's not for eating.
- What do you mean?

262
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:58,750
You could last for a week on that.

263
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,843
just a minute.
What are you up to. sonny?

264
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,945
Oh. nothing. nothing.
It's a memento.

265
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:05,956
A memento?

266
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,419
My sweetheart gave it to me
before I left home.

267
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,860
She gave you that?

268
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,694
Yes.
Can I have it back. please?

269
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:18,264
God. she must really love you.

270
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:24,905
Yeah. I've got a sort of sticky
feeling inside mejust thinking of it.

271
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:28,776
- You sure are a lucky guy.
- Come on. Fred. Cut it out.

272
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,111
- He's not getting in.
- I've got to. I've got to—

273
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:35,244
- Give him a break.just this once.
- No chance. Now push off. you.

274
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:45,059
]ust 'cause he's got a potato.
you can't let—

275
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:49,362
I'm tellin' you. that's what
they all say. Wait a minute.

276
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:53,427
Hey. you! Come back!

277
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:03,147
That's far enough.
Let's have a look at your legs.

279
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:30,802

to ﬂee the kingdom
ﬁ'om the pestilence.

284
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:50,259
Mounted on his mighty charger.
Sir Bromiades waged—

285
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,903
What's that?
Quickly. man.

286
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,962
Somebody might
be trying to poison me.

287
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:07,143
Plaster. Your Majesty.

288
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:09,874
Oh. Carry on. Passelevve.

289
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:13,850
- Mounted on his—
- The eleventh—

Carry on. Passelevve.

293
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:27,154
Until peace was once more
restored to the kingdom.

294
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:31,293
With that. lGng Max rode back
to the cheers of his subjects...

295
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:34,065
who lined the road
for over 50 miles.

296
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:39,270
Fifty miles? Do you mean
they cheered him all that way?

297
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:44,839
Wow! They certainly
must have respected him.

298
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:48,044
You're right. Passelevve.
We'll hold a tournament.

299
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:52,385
It's years since we've heard
the clash of sword against shield...

300
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:56,393
the clamor of mightily armored
knights crashing to the ground...

301
00:24:56,461 --> 00:25:01,455
the spurt of blood as the dagger
is thrust into unprotected groin.

302
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:03,296
Oh. no.

303
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:05,233
Oh. no. dear.
No. no. no. no.

304
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:09,706
What I had in mind was a—
was a tournament of plaisance.

305
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:13,235
A plaisance.’

306
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:17,338
Passelevve.
do my ear holes hear aright?

307
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:22,318
A plaisance with blunted sword
and collared lance?

308
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:25,515
Where's the honor in that?
Where's the glory...

309
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:28,889
in a bunch of buffoons
playing pillow ﬁghts. eh?

310
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,398
No! It must be
a l'autrance to the death.

311
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:37,526
- Please. Bruno. please.
- No. no. no.

312
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:40,730
Go with all speed
and make the arrangements.

313
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:44,700
I can't wait to tell the princess.

314
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:59,148
Daughter?

315
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:02,284
Still working hard. I see.

316
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:06,588
You and the blessed
Sisters of Misery.

Well. what are you making.
daughter?

318
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:16,369
A tapestry. Father. depicting the
famous siege of Castle Apcadwallader.

319
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:19,410
See? In this portion...

320
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:23,709
the king is eating his horse
on the 98th day of the siege.

321
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,516
Splendid!

322
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:30,712
Very pretty. daughter.
But you were always—

323
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:36,151
Careful. Father.
Sister Winnet fell out last week.

324
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:42,732
Daughter. our kingdom will
soon be he of the monster.

325
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:46,794
I have declared a tournament
to ﬁnd a champion to destroy it.

326
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:49,669
- What. the kingdom?
- Oh. no.

327
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:54,075
- Of course not. The monster.
- Oh! I see.

328
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:56,079
Yes. and not only that...

329
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:59,674
but the successful knight
will win your hand in marriage.

330
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,548
Marriage?

331
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:06,880
Yes. well. you want
to be married. surely?

332
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,926
- Of course I do. Daddy.
- Well. then.

333
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:12,896
But I want to marry a prince.
I'm supposed to marrya prince.

334
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:16,593
That's why! wait in this tower
just like all the books say to do.

335
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:19,933
Are any of the contestants princes?

336
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:26,276
- Well. not uactly.
- No?

337
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:29,745
No. but I could make one a prince.
couldn't I?

338
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:32,510
- I mean the winner.
- It's not the same.

339
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:37,385
No. not really.
Ah. well. never mind.

340
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:39,389
Once the monster is destroyed...

341
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:42,756
I will build you
a beautiful bridal suite...

342
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,954
in the lovely west tower.

343
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,204
On second thought...

344
00:27:58,276 --> 00:28:00,801
I think the view ﬁ'om
the lovely east tower...

345
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:04,144
would be inﬁnitely
more preferable. hmm?

346
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,689
- Who is it?
- Excuse me.

347
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:55,164
-Watch him. Watch him.
- What does he want?

348
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:59,363
- Could I have some of your soup?
- He's after our soup!

349
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:01,166
- Somebody stop him!
- Poke an 'ole in him!

350
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:05,509
- I'll do anything.
- Anything? Will he gather ﬁrewood?

351
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,511
I don't know.
What do you think?

352
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,672
I thinkwe should
poke an 'ole in him.

353
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,478
No. I'll collect some ﬁrewood foryou
if you let me have some of your soup.

354
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,177
Where do I get it ﬁ'om?

355
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:33,332
Well. could I have a little
taste of the soup ﬁrst?

356
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:36,601
just see if! like it?
No. I thought not.

357
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:43,214
Well. I'd better go then.
The ﬁrewood. was it?

358
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,698
So you've discovered
my diamond mine. have you?

359
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:46,210
- I was just gathering ﬁrewood.
- Liar! It's the diamonds you're after.

360
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:48,211
Theyre not diamonds.
Theyrejust rocks.

361
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,541
just rocks?

362
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:56,119
Quick thinking. but not quick
enough to save your skin!

363
00:30:56,187 --> 00:31:00,453
The secret of my diamond mine
dies with you!

364
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:37,658
I just dropped in to tell you
to start without me.

365
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:41,131
Perhaps another night.

00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:50,862

00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:15,313
Hearken before it is too late!

Well. what a coincidence.

00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,631

There. under the barrel.
Well. that's a guild sign.

421
00:37:08,025 --> 00:37:11,552
To work there. you've got to be
a member of the guild.

422
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:15,963
But you're not.
and I'm not and not likelyto be.

423
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:17,432
But that's not fair.

424
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:20,197
Fair or not.

00:47:47,564 --> 00:47:50,328
- You did it beautifully. boy!
- Was that me?

503
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,665
Come on!
I'll buyyou a drink.

504
00:47:53,737 --> 00:47:55,671
We'll go to
the Queen's Hemorrhoids. lad.

505
00:48:01,578 --> 00:48:03,944
- That better?
- oh. yeah.

506
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:07,006
- I can't remember when I ate last.
- Yes. I know.

507
00:48:07,084 --> 00:48:09,985
I once went without food
for 1 47 days.

508
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:12,248
A hundred and forty-seven days?

509
00:48:12,322 --> 00:48:15,519
It was the winter of '52.
the Siege of Caerlaverock.

510
00:48:15,592 --> 00:48:17,287
Food was so short—
What's the matter?

511
00:48:17,361 --> 00:48:19,522
- You got a stomachache?
- Oh. no.

512
00:48:19,596 --> 00:48:22,531
I was just trying to work out
what my nut move would be.

513
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:26,626
Sowas I.
Ieez. whyworry?

514
00:48:26,703 --> 00:48:28,261
I've got toworry.

515
00:48:28,338 --> 00:48:31,466
It's a very big step coming ﬁ'om
a small village to a big city.

516
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:35,341
Don't I know! That's what attracted me
to the life of a squire.

517
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:39,109
The traveling. One day you're out
in Hartford hunting heretics...

518
00:48:39,182 --> 00:48:43,346
the nut day you're up in Scotland
being burned at the stake.

519
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,718
The adventure!

520
00:48:45,789 --> 00:48:48,417
Like the time me and my knights
was ﬁghting...

521
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:50,426
the Blessed Sisters
of St. Alopecia...

522
00:48:50,494 --> 00:48:52,689
a band of warrior nuns.

523
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,754
- They really—
- It sounds very uciting.

524
00:48:54,831 --> 00:48:57,322
But how secure is it?
Now. you take coopering—

525
00:48:57,401 --> 00:49:00,165
Cooperi ng? Cooperi ng?

526
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:02,637
Hell!
That's no life for a man!

527
00:49:02,706 --> 00:49:06,005
It is too.
Barrels and casks are very important.

528
00:49:06,076 --> 00:49:07,976
- Now. in commerce—
- Commerce!

529
00:49:08,812 --> 00:49:12,543
Rubbish!
Now you listen to me.

530
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:14,811
My knight was wounded. see...

531
00:49:14,885 --> 00:49:17,217
and there was I
with my back to the wall...

532
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:20,518
two whacking great nuns
coming at me with maces.

533
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:23,150
I hardly think ﬁghting nuns
is a very respectable way—

534
00:49:23,226 --> 00:49:25,717
Here. I'll show you!
Come here!

535
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:28,492
Now you try.
Come at me. Put up!

536
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:30,499
Pretend that drumstick is a mace.

537
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:32,899
Oh. come on!

538
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:35,700
Really let me have it.

539
00:49:35,772 --> 00:49:38,206
- I can't.
- Go for me!

540
00:49:38,275 --> 00:49:39,708
I deﬂected the mace!

541
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:44,479
Then I grabbed her like this!

542
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:47,508
- I want you to talk to the landlord.
- What?

543
00:49:47,584 --> 00:49:50,849
Then I threw her again like this!

544
00:49:50,921 --> 00:49:53,515
- I want you to distract him.
- What for?

545
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:57,720
You berk! She was tough. see.
but I grabbed her in the old—

546
00:49:57,794 --> 00:50:00,058
-just keep him talking.
- I don't understand.

547
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:03,463
You will.just do it!

548
00:50:03,533 --> 00:50:06,195
Now here comes the best part.

549
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:09,067
She broke my grip. see.
She was coming in for the kill.

550
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:13,701
When I turned tail
and ran for it.

551
00:50:13,777 --> 00:50:15,836
slamming shut the castle doors...

552
00:50:15,912 --> 00:50:20,076
I barred them with a lance. grabbing
one of the novices as a hostage.

553
00:50:22,285 --> 00:50:25,379
I fought my way
up to the battlements...

554
00:50:25,455 --> 00:50:27,821
hacking and slashing as I went.

555
00:50:27,891 --> 00:50:31,383
All in tears. in cuts!

556
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:37,297
Easily outdistancing the enemy.
I escaped.
