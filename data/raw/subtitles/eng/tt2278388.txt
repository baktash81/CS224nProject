00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:03,916
that he's constantly
inventing an endless supply

4
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,092
of incidents and episodes,

5
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:09,968
that he simply dreams up
his stories out of thin air.

6
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:12,846
In point of fact,
the opposite is true.

If I learn you ever once laid
a finger on my mother's body,

506
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:12,384
living or dead, I swear to God,

507
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:14,128
I'll cut your throat!
You hear me?

508
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:16,464
I thought I was supposed
to be a fucking faggot.

509
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:18,764
You are, but you're bisexual.

510
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,134
Let's change the subject.

511
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:21,389
I'm leaving.

512
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,273
Wait here quietly. please.

513
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:33,697
That picture, <i>Boy with Apple,</i>
is priceless. Understand?

514
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:35,399
Congratulations,
<i>Monsieur</i> Gustave!

515
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:37,367
They're going to fight me
for the son of a bitch.

516
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:38,659
Is it very beautiful?

517
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:39,869
Beyond description.

518
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:42,539
"E'en the most gifted bard's
rhyme can only sing

519
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:44,746
but to the lack of her
and all she isn't!"

520
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:47,370
"His tongue doth..."
Can I see it?

521
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:49,579
I don't see why not.

522
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:23,617
This is van Hoytl's
exquisite portrayal

523
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:26,083
of a beautiful boy
on the cusp of manhood.

524
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,915
Blond, smooth. Skin as
white as that milk.

525
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,462
Of impeccable provenance.

526
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:34,208
One of the last in private hands,
and unquestionably, the best.

527
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:35,713
It's a masterpiece.

528
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,965
The rest of this shit
is worthless junk.

529
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,973
<i>M. Gustave?</i>

530
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,147
Can I help you?

531
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,015
Yes. Serge.

532
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,939
You can wrap this up. please.

533
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:36,310
Wrap up...

534
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,984
Wrap up... "Boy With Apple"?

535
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,509
What did you want
to tell me, before?

536
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:02,838
I think I cannot say right now.

537
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:05,344
Write me tomorrow.
Lutzbahn Station!

538
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,312
I'll never part with it.

539
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:23,901
It reminded her of me. It will
remind me of her. Always.

540
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:26,825
I'll die with this
picture above my bed.

541
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:29,030
See the resemblance?

542
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:32,033
Oh, yes.

543
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:39,090
Actually, we should sell it.

544
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:42,336
Sooner rather than later, in
case they try to steal it back.

545
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:43,905
Plus, something about
those lunatic

546
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,259
foot-soldiers
on the express...

547
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:48,884
This could be a tricky war and a
long dry spell in the hotel trade.

548
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,599
For all we know, they could
board us up tomorrow.

549
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,902
Let's make
a solemn blood-pact.

550
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:02,423
We'll contact the black market
and liquidate <i>Boy with Apple</i>

551
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:03,607
by the end of the week,

552
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,067
then leave the country
and lay low

553
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,610
somewhere along
the Maltese Riviera

554
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,363
until the troubles blow over
and we resume our posts.

555
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:11,289
In exchange for
your help, your loyalty

556
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,283
and your services
as my personal valet,

557
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:18,039
I pledge to you 1.5%
of the net sale price.

558
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,248
1.5?
Plus room and board.

559
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,128
Could we make it 10?
10? Are you joking?

560
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:26,095
That's more than
I'd pay an actual dealer,

561
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,598
and you wouldn't know chiaroscuro
from chicken giblets.

562
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:30,478
No, 1.5 is correct.
But I'll tell you what,

563
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:33,891
if I die first, and I most certainly
will, you will be my sole heir.

564
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,495
There's not much
in the kitty except

565
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:36,898
a set of ivory-backed
hairbrushes

566
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,441
and my library of
romantic poetry,

567
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:41,270
but when the time comes,
these will be yours,

568
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:44,778
along with whatever we haven't
already spent on whores and whiskey.

569
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,568
This is our sacred bond.

570
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,778
I'll draw it up right now.

The police are here.
They asked for you.

579

Tell them I'll be right down.

580
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,504
Okay.

581
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,724
Have you ever been questioned
by the authorities?

582
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:58,331
Yes, on one occasion
I was arrested

583
00:34:58,346 --> 00:34:59,643
and tortured by
the rebel militia

584
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:00,895
after the Desert Uprising.

585
00:35:01,141 --> 00:35:03,064
You know the drill, then. Zip it.
Of course.

586
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:06,689
You've never heard the word "van
Hoytl" in your life. Okay, let's go.

587
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:23,705
How may we serve you, gentlemen?

588
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,166
Ah, Inspector Henckels.

589
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:28,923
"By order of the Commissioner
of Police, Zubrowka Province,

590

00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:41,624
What happened, my dear Zero,
is I beat the living shit

601
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:44,457
out of a sniveling little runt
called Pinky Bandinski

602
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:46,459
who had the gall to
question my virility,

because if there's one thing we've
learned from penny dreadfuls,

604
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:51,285
it's that, when you find
yourself in a place like this,

605
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,802
you must never
be a candy-ass.

606

You've got to prove
yourself from Day One.

607
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,632
You've got to win their respect.

608
00:36:56,965 --> 00:37:00,094
You should take a long look
at his ugly mug this morning.

609
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,273
He's, actually,
become a dear friend.

610
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:06,975
You'll meet him, I hope.

611
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:10,024
So. You've talked to Kovacs?

612
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:11,647
I saw him last night in secret.

613
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:14,136
He made me take an oath on a
Bible I wouldn't tell a soul.

614
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:15,366
You're supposed to also.

615
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,655
I'll do that later.

616
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:17,990
He suspects you're innocent.

617
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:19,325
Of course he does.

618
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,285
What's the charge?

619
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:25,669
In the small hours of
the evening of 19 October,

620
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:28,918
an individual well-known to the house
and staff, a <i>Monsieur</i> Gustave H,

621
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:32,251
did arrive at the Desgoffe
und Taxis residence in Lutz

622
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:34,962
and entered by
the rear service alley,

623
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,513
alerting no one to his presence,

624
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:40,468
and did then proceed by way of
back stairs and servants' passage,

625
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:43,019
to deliver himself into the
private chambers of Madame D.

626
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:45,768
There is no evidence
to indicate whether this visit

627
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:48,441
had been pre-arranged
with her or not.

628
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:53,522
The next morning Madame D was found
dead by strychnine poisoning.

629
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,891
<i>Monsieur</i> Gustave was not
observed on the premises again

630
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:59,239
until, of course,
24 hours later.

631
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:01,697
The identity of
his accusers is made

632
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:04,116
clear in this
notarized deposition.

633
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:07,749
They include, essentially, all
members of the extended family,

634
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:12,674
but the key witness who actually
ostensibly saw the alleged events

635
00:38:12,874 --> 00:38:15,502
appears to have
fled the jurisdiction.

636
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,383
His whereabouts are
currently unknown,

637
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:20,215
but he's being sought and pursued
by the relevant authorities.

638
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:22,517
Who is he?

639
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:27,639
Serge?

640
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:28,765
I'm afraid so.

642
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:33,562
No, I don't believe it.
They put him up to it.

643
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:35,898
I've been dropped
into a nest of vipers.

644
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:37,106
You have an alibi?

645
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,488
Of course, but she's married
to the Duke of Westphalia.

646
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:42,333
I can't allow her name to get
mixed-up in all this monkey business.

647
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:44,372
Your life may be at stake.

648
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:46,332
I know, but the bitch legged it.

649
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:50,288

Tell him, Ludwig.

729
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:53,970
Checkpoint 19 ain't
no two-bit hoosegow.

730
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:57,427
You got broad-gauge iron bars
on every door, vent and window.

731
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:01,230
You got 72 guards on the floor
and 16 more in the towers.

732
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:05,731
You got a 325-foot drop into
a moat full of crocodiles.

733
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:07,903
But, like the best of them,
it's got a soft spot,

734
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:09,856
which in this case
happens to take the form

735
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:12,192
of a storm-drain sewer system

736
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,698
dating from the time of the
original rock fortification

737
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:16,950
way back in the Middle Ages.

738
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:20,250
Now, nobody's saying it's a stroll
down a tree-lined promenade

739
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:22,201
with a fine lady
and a white poodle,

740
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:26,040
but it's got what
you'd call "vulnerability,"

741
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:28,921
and that's our bread and butter.

742
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,923
Take a look.

743
00:44:33,129 --> 00:44:34,472
Who drew this?

744
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,766
What do you mean,
"Who drew this?" I did.

745
00:44:36,966 --> 00:44:39,060
Very good. You've got
a wonderful line, Ludwig.

746
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:40,933
This shows great
artistic promise.

747
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:44,516
Question, how do you intend to
penetrate this lowest rudiment?

748
00:44:44,724 --> 00:44:47,273
It's 25 inches of reinforced
granite masonry, is it not?

749
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:49,194
Digging with
the throat-slitter,

750
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:52,023
I expect this would take three to
six months of continual effort,

751
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:53,792
during which time
several of our members

752
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,363
will have been
violently executed.

753
00:44:55,568 --> 00:44:57,912
You hit the nail on the head,
Mr. Gustave.

We got fake documents,
second-hand street clothes,

a rope ladder made of
sticks and bunk-linens,

756
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:05,369
but we need digging tools,

757
00:45:05,578 --> 00:45:08,548

come by in this flop-house.

the thought of her name

770
