00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,252
I'll teach you
how to ride, Shirley.

3
00:00:51,252 --> 00:00:52,820
I started
when I was 8.

4
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:53,954
No, no.

5
00:00:53,954 --> 00:00:55,856
I'm talking horses here,
Shirley.

6
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,279
Hey, Ramon.

7
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:33,747
Take him in.
He'll win.

8
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:35,148
Huh.

9
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:36,484
Oh.

10
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:39,019
Now, where's my girlfriend?

11
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:43,424
Where's my girlfriend?

12
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:44,825
There's my girlfriend.

13
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:47,895
How ya doin',
beautiful lady?

14
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:50,298
Beautiful lady, I love you.

15
00:03:50,298 --> 00:03:52,600
Now let me see
those legs now.

16
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,902
Ahh. You got great legs,
honey.

17
00:03:57,438 --> 00:03:59,172
Yeah. Great legs.

18
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:00,708
They're in great shape.

19
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,849
Easy, boy.
What are you doing?

20
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:10,851
Nice and easy.

21
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,857
Morning, Billy.
How's it going?

22
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:18,459
Morning, carmine.

23
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,262
Hey, Josie, my posie.

24
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,664
Listen,
could you help me out?

25
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:25,232
Cover for me
this afternoon.

26
00:04:25,232 --> 00:04:26,467
I have some business
to attend to.

27
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:28,869
Sure, Billy.
You gonna see Goodman?

28
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:30,070
Oh, I don't know.

29
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,807
Uh, maybe, but keep it
under your hat, will ya?

30
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:34,875
Bless you.

31
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,949
Gonna do it, champ?

32
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,584
You gonna really do it?

33
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:45,285
We're gonna have
to keep at it.

34
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,687
We gotta listen
to this guy.

35
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:48,689
And then if he makes
any sense, t.J.--

36
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:50,691
listen,
if he makes any sense

37
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:52,292
we'll consider it,
right, t.J.?

38
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,494
Right, champ.

39
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,696
The champ's gonna do it!

40
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:57,631
The champ's gonna do it!

41
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,299
What's the excitement,
t.J.?

42
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,234
Charlie Goodman.
He wants the champ bad.

43
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,836
The champ's gonna
fight him again.

44
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:04,237
Hey, hey, hey!

45
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:05,272
Charlie Goodman?

46
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:06,540
Nothing about
Charlie Goodman.

47
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,641
You listen
to this kid, man?

48
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,142
What, you're gonna
fight again?

49
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,544
I didn't say nothin'.
Did I say somethin'?

50
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:11,745
Hey, come here.

51
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:13,246
What are you getting me
in trouble for?

52
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:14,682
Good luck,
Billy.

53
00:05:14,682 --> 00:05:16,784
Good luck nothin'.
Why'd you say that to him?

54
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,253
Billy, slow down.

55
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:22,856
If you feel like going
in the ring again,

56
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:24,257
maybe you should,

57
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,859
but be careful.

58
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:26,794
You're 37.

59
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:28,662
Last time you fought,
you were 30.

60
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,664
Jersey Joe walcott...

61
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,265
Took the heavyweight
championship of the world

62
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,668
when he was 37 years old.

63
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,404
Archie Moore was how old?
He was 50. Who knows?

64
00:05:36,404 --> 00:05:38,005
I know that, too.

65
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:39,206
All I'm saying

66
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:41,141
is that neither of those guys
laid off for 7 years.

67
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:42,275
Hey, Jimmy.

68
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,678
Hey. 1,200 bucks
I made off you

69
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,880
in the Johnny ward fight.

70
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,081
Yeah.

71
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:50,283
Double up on the hooks.
Caught him in the 8th.

72
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:51,685
Oh, you were beautiful,
Billy.

73
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,286
I remember
watching your fights

74
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:54,688
and saying to myself,

75
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,690
"my god, this kid has got
such talent."

76
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,692
I figured you'd hold
the title for 5 more years.

77
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,260
But you had one bad fight,

78
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,862
you lose it,
and you walk away.

79
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,533
I gotta go,
Mr. Riley.

80
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:07,835
Good luck, Billy.

81
00:06:07,835 --> 00:06:09,437
Come on! Let's go!

82
00:06:09,437 --> 00:06:11,472
What's this?
What's the hold up here?

83
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:16,276
Let's go, let's go!

84
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:18,145
Come on, come on.
Keep coming.

85
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:23,551
Where you been?

86
00:06:23,551 --> 00:06:25,586
Forgot to get something
for you.

87
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:27,154
What do you got
in the box?

88
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:28,622
I'll show you later.

89
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:43,837
Do you like it?

90
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,907
Yeah, I like it.

91
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:53,280
I like it very much.

92
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,483
It's for your comeback.

93
00:06:55,483 --> 00:06:56,917
Comeback?

94
00:06:58,318 --> 00:07:00,353
Comebacks are
for has-beens, right?

95
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:01,489
Right, champ.

96
00:07:01,489 --> 00:07:03,457
Let's get this show
on the road.

97
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,271
Yeah. Wait.
Hold on.

98
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,673
Hi, Billy.

99
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:21,475
That's
Billy Flynn!

100
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:32,452
Pick it up, Johnny!

101
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,087
Pick it up,
for Christ's sake!

102
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:36,690
What have I got here,
a fighter or a piece of meat?

103
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,526
I said jab!
Move! I mean it!

104
00:07:38,526 --> 00:07:39,927
Pick it up!

105
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:41,495
You're not showing me
nothing but your hands!

106
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:44,231
You look like a bum
up there!

107
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:46,834
Get the hell out of there!

108
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:48,636
Go on! You're no fighter!

109
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:51,905
Ah, come on.

110
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:53,173
Come on!

111
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:55,509
Blood in your mouth, that's all.
What do you expect?

112
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:57,511
Get out there and punch!

113
00:07:57,511 --> 00:07:58,912
Get out there! Jab!

114
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:00,648
Move! Get out
and get your hands up!

115
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:02,482
God damn it! Get them up!

116
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,884
Move! Kill him!

117
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:06,119
Now hit him! He's wide open!
What are you doing?

118
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:07,487
Move in on him!

119
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:10,624
Billy.

120
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,595
Georgie.

121
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:15,963
It's good to see you.

122
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:18,566
So nice to see you,
Georgie.

123
00:08:18,566 --> 00:08:20,734
I got something
to show you.

124
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:23,470
I saved this for you
for 7 years.

125
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,305
Your gloves.

126
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:27,307
The gloves
of a champion.

127
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:28,909
Your locker, Billy.

128
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:37,718
I saved all your stuff,
Billy.

129
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:39,720
Got the trunks, the cup,
the headgear.

130
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,054
It's all here.

131
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:42,122
I said, "someday

132
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:43,824
"Billy's gonna walk
through that door,

133
00:08:43,824 --> 00:08:46,560
and he's gonna
ask for it."

134
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,895
Has Goodman showed up yet?

135
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:49,362
No, not yet.
But he'll be here.

136
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,531
You think this is right,
Georgie?

137
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,001
That I should show him
what I got?

138
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:55,603
That I should step
in that ring

139
00:08:55,603 --> 00:08:57,037
and show him what I got?

140
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:00,874
I made a lot of money
for that man.

141
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:04,277
Champion of the world.
It ain't right.

142
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:05,879
I'm taking a walk.

143
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:08,582
Billy!

144
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:10,684
What are we going
to tell him?

145
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:12,519
You tell him
exactly what I said!

146
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,887
Hey, what's the matter?

147
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,689
And if he wants to wait
for me, that's fine.

148
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:17,290
He can wait for me!

149
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:22,996
I'll be back
in half an hour.

150
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:33,173
Hi, George.

151
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:01,094
* I wanna be *

152
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:03,831
* I wanna be
in that number *

153
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:08,135
* when the saints
go marchin' in *

154
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:16,810
Come on.
Walk straight.

155
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:20,613
Here. I gotcha.

156
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,215
Come on, champ.

157
00:11:24,752 --> 00:11:27,087
Billy?

158
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:28,488
Billy?

159
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:30,357
Is everything ok?

160
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:32,459
Oh, I had 4 beers.

161
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:35,162
You--you need
some help, hmm?

162
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:37,164
Oh, no. It's ok.
I can handle him.

163
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:38,766
He can handle
everything.

164
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:40,367
He can handle
everything.

165
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,368
Yeah.

166
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:42,770
I can walk. Look.

167
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,037
Come on, champ.

168
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,773
Watch out
for the steps.

169
00:11:45,773 --> 00:11:47,040
See? I'm walkin'.

170
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,776
It was
Charlie Goodman's idea.

171
00:11:48,776 --> 00:11:50,778
Really. Just a couple
of beers.

172
00:11:50,778 --> 00:11:52,179
And you know,

173
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:54,281
everyone started
to buy him drinks.

174
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:56,516
He didn't wanna hurt
everybody's feelings.

175
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:57,650
Right.

176
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,252
Thanks a lot, Josie.

177
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:00,988
See ya.

178
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:12,499
Oh, boy.

179
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,501
Ohh.

180
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:16,236
Boy, it's hot
in here.

181
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:22,375
Ahh.

182
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:24,377
Thanks, t.J.

183
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:25,979
You're
a good boy.

184
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:28,181
You're a good boy.

185
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:30,383
You know why
I lost the title?

186
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:32,385
I lost my title,
t.J.

187
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:34,387
Why, champ?

188
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:38,859
'Cause i--i didn't care.

189
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:43,530
I just--the hell with it.
I didn't care anymore.

190
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:48,535
You hear that, t.J.?
I didn't care.

191
00:12:54,674 --> 00:12:56,810
Let's get undressed,
champ.

192
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,812
Let me take off
your pants.

193
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:01,114
Here.
Let me do that.

194
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,782
Whoop.
Let me do it.

195
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:06,153
The day a man can't
take off his own pants

196
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:08,088
then he ain't a man.

197
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:14,761
Why don't you go brush
your teeth, huh?

198
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:16,229
Sure, champ.

199
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,431
Can you help me
with this?

200
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:20,167
Yeah, I'll help you
with this. Yeah.

201
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:22,235
Look. Easy as pie.
See that?

202
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,239
Come on.
Come on, let's go.

203
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,125
Listen to me.

204
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:48,996
I--i ain't gonna
drink no more.

205
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,798
I ain't gonna
gamble no more,

206
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:53,800
you understand?

207
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,202
Understand that,
kid?

208
00:13:55,202 --> 00:13:57,004
I ain't gonna
gamble no more.

209
00:13:58,405 --> 00:13:59,572
Sure, champ.

210
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:02,375
Yeah. You think
I'm telling the truth?

211
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:05,578
Of course I do.

212
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:08,115
Of course you do.
You're a good boy, t.J.

213
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:16,789
People think
they know everything.

214
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,391
They don't know nothin'.

215
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:20,593
They don't know nothin'.

216
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,795
They weren't in there
taking the punches.

217
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:24,397
What do they know?

218
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:27,200
I just didn't
give a damn.

219
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,402
I didn't care anymore.

220
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:33,273
I didn't care.

221
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,285
Good night, t.J.

222
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:52,892
Good night, champ.

223
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,271
Oh.

224
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:22,182
TV rights,
or the champ doesn't fight.

225
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:24,184
The champ's gonna sign
for 50 thou

226
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:26,186
and not a nickel less.

227
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:27,587
Where is Billy now?

228
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:29,456
Oh, he's around here
somewhere.

229
00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:31,058
Hola.
Â¿billy, que tal?

230
00:16:31,058 --> 00:16:33,193
Watch out. Here I come.

231
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:35,195
Good morning, Freddie.

232
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:37,797
Oh, there's the champ now.
There he is!

233
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:38,798
Anybody miss me?

234
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:40,067
Yeah, Riley did.

235
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:41,334
Champ!

236
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:42,802
Where've you been?
I've been waiting.

237
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:44,204
I know,
I know, t.J.

238
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:45,705
I had
a bad night.

239
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:47,607
Yes,
but I've been going crazy.

240
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:50,410
Of course you're going crazy.
Know why you're going crazy?

241
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,612
Because...

242
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:54,814
It's hereditary.
It's in your blood.

243
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:56,416
You got a crazy father.

244
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:57,817
Ohh.

245
00:16:57,817 --> 00:16:59,086
I'll tell you,

246
00:16:59,086 --> 00:17:00,520
you know where
I was all last night?

247
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,654
Where?

248
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:02,655
Oh, boy.

249
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:03,790
Oh, boy.

250
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:07,794
I couldn't sleep
last night.

251
00:17:07,794 --> 00:17:09,196
Know why?

252
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:10,597
Why?

253
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:13,200
'Cause I let my son down
yesterday,

254
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,801
spent all the money
on liquor.

255
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:16,403
What else is new?

256
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:20,273
Horrible.

257
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:22,209
And on top
of everything else,

258
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:23,676
worst of all...

259
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:27,214
I stole $20

260
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:28,948
from my own son.

261
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:29,949
Oh! Aw!

262
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:31,818
It's ok, champ.

263
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,088
My money is your money.

264
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:36,489
Right on, t.J.

265
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:38,691
No, it's not ok.
What a terrible thing to do.

266
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:40,993
And you know what I did
with the money?

267
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:41,994
What do you think?

268
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:43,530
Go gambling.

269
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,232
That's right.
I went gambling.

270
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:46,866
You know your father
too well.

271
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:48,235
So I go back
to the crap table.

272
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:49,636
Of course I go back
to the crap table.

273
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:52,239
And I lay the money
down on the crap table,

274
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:54,574
and your old man
is shooting the craps, see?

275
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,075
And what do you think
happens there?

276
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:59,246
I make 7 straight passes,
lettin' it ride every time.

277
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:00,580
7 straight passes.

278
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,515
Your old man
was winning last night.

279
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:03,983
Now how much
do you think he won?

280
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:05,152
100?

281
00:18:05,152 --> 00:18:06,619
More than that.
How much?

282
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:07,887
200?

283
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:09,922
Right in this pocket here.
How much did I walk out with?

284
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:10,923
400?

285
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,625
$6,400!

286
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,527
Yay! Yay!

287
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:16,529
$6,400!

288
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:18,698
$6,400?

289
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:20,333
Champ always comes through
in the end.

290
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,734
That's it. That's right.

291
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:23,636
And you know what
I did with the money?

292
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:24,437
And you blew it.

293
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:25,738
No, I didn't blow it.

294
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:27,540
I got some presents
for my friends here.

295
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,808
Come on.
I'm not kidding you.

296
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:30,443
Everybody, come on.
Come on over to the car.

297
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,779
I got presents for everybody.
Come on. Let's go.

298
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,080
Come on.

299
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,483
All right.
Watch this, t.J.

300
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:38,651
Let me see
what we got here.

301
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:39,652
Me, me!

302
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:40,453
Over here!

303
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:41,621
Ok, who wants the bottle?

304
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:44,457
Who wants that?
There you go.

305
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,859
Who wants this?
There you go.

306
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:49,229
All right, wait a minute!
What's going on?

307
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:50,430
Pow! We got some candy.

308
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,831
Yay! Yay!

309
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:53,366
Marlboros!

310
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:58,871
Everybody get your hands up!
These are thrown things, people!

311
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:00,740
Ask me what I got for t.J.
Ask me about t.J.

312
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,543
Hey, Billy,
what'd you get for t.J.?

313
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:06,213
What'd I get for t.J.?

314
00:19:06,213 --> 00:19:07,847
Ohh. Ohh.

315
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:09,416
What?

316
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:10,383
Ohh.

317
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:12,819
How could I forgot
my own son?

318
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:13,820
Billy.

319
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,621
Ohh. Ohh.

320
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:16,289
Oh, no. Poor t.J.

321
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:19,759
Now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

322
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:21,361
Maybe there was
a little something.

323
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:22,762
I gotta think now.

324
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:24,631
Yeah, yeah.

325
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:26,233
Well, let me see
if I can find it.

326
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:27,234
Mr. Riley!

327
00:19:27,234 --> 00:19:28,235
Mr. Riley!

328
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:31,504
Would you bring that little
thing I got for t.J.?

329
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,240
Bring it right over here,
please?

330
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,841
I can't see it.

331
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:35,842
Oh!

332
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:37,244
It's a horse.

333
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:54,994
Oh, yes.

334
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:56,729
She's beautiful.

335
00:19:58,064 --> 00:20:00,267
Well, what's the matter?
Don't you like it?

336
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:01,868
I could take it back.

337
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:05,272
She's mine?

338
00:20:05,272 --> 00:20:06,606
Yeah.

339
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:09,542
All mine?

340
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,611
Yeah, yeah.
She's all yours!

341
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:14,013
Really all mine?

342
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:15,348
Yeah!

343
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:21,421
She's a beautiful horse,
this one, son.

344
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:23,290
Here we go--whoop.

345
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,691
She's a lady.

346
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:26,293
That's the name
of the horse--

347
00:20:26,293 --> 00:20:27,894
"she's a lady."

348
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:39,306
The world's...

349
00:20:39,306 --> 00:20:40,907
The world's youngest
horse owner.

350
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:42,309
That's what he is.

351
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:43,910
Feels great, huh?

352
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:14,507
Ladies and gentlemen,

353
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:15,575
your attention, please.

354
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:19,245
Your changes
for the third race.

355
00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:23,850
Bobby castle will now
be up on number 5,

356
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,485
Sunday's child.

357
00:21:25,485 --> 00:21:27,487
And perdition,
number 7 horse,

358
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:31,324
will carry 120 pounds.

359
00:21:50,877 --> 00:21:53,212
...in honor of our beautiful
flamingoes

360
00:21:53,212 --> 00:21:54,914
who reside here at hialeah.

361
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:57,183
And prior to the last
race of the day,

362
00:21:57,183 --> 00:21:58,551
lovely gifts will be presented

363
00:21:58,551 --> 00:22:02,455
to the lady and gentleman
in the best pink attire.

364
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:07,259
All right. Beautiful day
here at hialeah.

365
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:08,428
Plenty of sunshine.

366
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:10,497
Dolly kenyon,
owner of the brilliant

367
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:12,031
3-year-old champion
just a sec.

368
00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:15,301
Don't forget this race.
I got a horse in this race, too.

369
00:22:15,301 --> 00:22:16,436
Of course,
Dolly's chance.

370
00:22:16,436 --> 00:22:18,070
Yeah, that little bay
over there.

371
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,607
She didn't cost much,
but she's a good animal.

372
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:22,542
Anybody can do
what my husband does.

373
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:24,411
He pays hundreds
of thousand of dollars

374
00:22:24,411 --> 00:22:26,078
for just a sec.

375
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:30,149
I paid $5,000, and she's
gonna win this race.

376
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:31,317
Bullshit.

377
00:22:31,317 --> 00:22:33,019
Who said that?

378
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:34,120
Who said what?

379
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,121
Bullshit.

380
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:36,889
Somebody said bullshit.

381
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:40,292
Mrs. Kenyon,
what about just a sec?

382
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:41,561
Just a horse,
just a horse.

383
00:22:41,561 --> 00:22:43,563
Thank you very much
and good luck.

384
00:22:43,563 --> 00:22:45,698
Did you say that,
little boy?

385
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:47,199
You weren't
supposed to hear.

386
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,768
Well, I heard.

387
00:22:48,768 --> 00:22:51,538
See, boy...

388
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:53,473
What are you doing
here anyway?

389
00:22:53,473 --> 00:22:55,575
What do you mean,
what am I doing here?

390
00:22:55,575 --> 00:22:57,009
I'm a horse owner like you,

391
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:58,645
and mine's gonna win.

392
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:02,949
What's your name?

393
00:23:02,949 --> 00:23:04,016
And speak up.

394
00:23:04,016 --> 00:23:04,951
T.j.

395
00:23:04,951 --> 00:23:06,719
I said your name,
not your initials.

396
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:09,556
Look, I gotta talk
to my rider.

397
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:11,323
I can't waste my time
with you. Jeffie!

398
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:12,692
Yeah?

399
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:14,427
Where've you been.
I've got to talk to you.

400
00:23:14,427 --> 00:23:16,496
Little smart aleck.

401
00:23:16,496 --> 00:23:18,998
Thank you very much.

402
00:23:18,998 --> 00:23:22,969
Jeffie, don't raid her,
don't raid her.

403
00:23:22,969 --> 00:23:24,471
You told me already.

404
00:23:24,471 --> 00:23:26,606
Don't let her
get boxed in.

405
00:23:26,606 --> 00:23:27,740
Go to the front

406
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,308
and improve
your position.

407
00:23:29,308 --> 00:23:30,477
Sure, sure. Relax, t.J.

408
00:23:30,477 --> 00:23:31,778
I'll ride the horse.
You watch.

409
00:23:31,778 --> 00:23:33,746
Everything's cool, ok?

410
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,815
That's some horse.

411
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:39,251
Is she really yours?

412
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,553
Yeah.

413
00:23:40,553 --> 00:23:43,456
Mine and my dad's.

414
00:23:43,456 --> 00:23:46,559
She's got an extremely
attractive head.

415
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,427
Good combination.

416
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,229
What's her name?

417
00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:52,264
She's a lady.

418
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:55,602
Whoever named her knew
what he was talking about.

419
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:57,637
She has good composure.

420
00:23:57,637 --> 00:24:00,673
Are you with that...

421
00:24:00,673 --> 00:24:03,375
Um, "sassy boy," lady?

422
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,244
She's a personal
friend of mine.

423
00:24:05,244 --> 00:24:07,647
Personal friend or not,

424
00:24:07,647 --> 00:24:09,081
don't bet on that horse.

425
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:11,117
Bet on mine.
You'll make a million.

426
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:12,251
Believe me.

427
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:13,653
Well, I need a million.

428
00:24:13,653 --> 00:24:15,387
You got it.
It's in the bank.

429
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:18,024
Ok.

430
00:24:18,024 --> 00:24:20,560
I'll, um...

431
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,961
I'll bet her.

432
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:24,463
But if she
doesn't pay off,

433
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:25,965
I'll come
looking for you.

434
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:27,734
Ok.

435
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:30,670
My name's t.J.

436
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,542
Oh...

437
00:24:35,542 --> 00:24:37,243
And if he does
pay off,

438
00:24:37,243 --> 00:24:39,646
I'll come
looking for you.

439
00:24:41,681 --> 00:24:43,650
The name's Annie.

440
00:24:50,557 --> 00:24:52,491
Good luck, Annie.

441
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,340
Truly named
home of the champions.

442
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,341
For instance...

443
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,210
That's my horse.

444
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,712
That's my horse.

445
00:25:12,712 --> 00:25:14,747
She's gonna win.

446
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:18,818
The first horse
to win over one million dollars.

447
00:25:18,818 --> 00:25:22,488
This was called Seattle slew's
winter playground.

448
00:25:22,488 --> 00:25:24,591
Other great champions
who raced here:

449
00:25:24,591 --> 00:25:27,594
Affirmed, alydar...

450
00:25:27,594 --> 00:25:29,195
Was that a kid
or a jockey?

451
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:30,763
He owns the horse.

452
00:25:30,763 --> 00:25:33,966
What? Did you see
what he did to Dolly?

453
00:25:33,966 --> 00:25:36,569
I think Dolly
was flirting with him.

454
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:38,137
How about you?

455
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:40,973
I guess I was. Hello.

456
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:42,308
I promised to bet his horse.

457
00:25:42,308 --> 00:25:43,542
Uh-oh.

458
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,244
Will you do me a favor
and put $10 on her?

459
00:25:45,244 --> 00:25:46,746
It's number one.

460
00:25:46,746 --> 00:25:48,214
She's a lady.

461
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:50,382
Mmm. Oh, but I don't think
you should say anything

462
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:51,383
to Dolly about it.

463
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,719
No.

464
00:26:00,593 --> 00:26:02,629
Ladies and gentlemen,

465
00:26:02,629 --> 00:26:04,496
10 minutes to post time.

466
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:06,165
Post time in 10 minutes.

467
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:08,367
Got any horse owners
in this line?

468
00:26:08,367 --> 00:26:09,769
Yes, I'm a horse owner.

469
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:11,003
You're a horse owner?

470
00:26:11,003 --> 00:26:13,372
You're in the wrong
line, horse owner.

471
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:14,774
I asked about this line.

472
00:26:14,774 --> 00:26:16,142
I'm just kidding.

473
00:26:16,142 --> 00:26:18,177
I know a horse owner
who's 8 years old.

474
00:26:18,177 --> 00:26:19,679
That's right.

475
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,114
No. I'm telling
you the truth.

476
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:24,917
My son owns a horse.
He's 8 years old.

477
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,653
I got some
money together.

478
00:26:26,653 --> 00:26:27,920
I got him
a nice horse.

479
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,388
Horses are nice for
kids to be around.

480
00:26:29,388 --> 00:26:31,057
Anyway, I get him the horse,

481
00:26:31,057 --> 00:26:32,324
and he's going
to sleep that night.

482
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:34,326
He's actually
falling asleep that night,

483
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:36,829
and he says to me,
he says, "champ--"

484
00:26:36,829 --> 00:26:39,198
he calls me champ
'cause I used to be a boxer.

485
00:26:39,198 --> 00:26:41,400
He says, "you would
do this for me?"

486
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,637
He said, "I can't believe it.
You are a good father."

487
00:26:44,637 --> 00:26:46,405
He fell asleep.

488
00:26:46,405 --> 00:26:49,676
Yes, 10--i don't want
the odds to go down.

489
00:26:49,676 --> 00:26:52,578
10 on number one to win.

490
00:26:52,578 --> 00:26:53,846
She's a lady.

491
00:26:53,846 --> 00:26:55,882
Nice talking to you folks.

492
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:08,995
Ladies and gentlemen,

493
00:27:08,995 --> 00:27:11,130
the horses are coming
onto the track...

494
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:15,101
The owner of the horse,
please, ladies.

495
00:27:15,101 --> 00:27:18,004
There. Sit up, boy.
Watch out.

496
00:27:18,004 --> 00:27:20,006
No, he's a genuine owner.

497
00:27:20,006 --> 00:27:24,043
Youngest owner
in the history of hialeah.

498
00:27:24,043 --> 00:27:25,077
Move back.

499
00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:26,645
Yeah, lady,
I'm gonna move back.

500
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:30,382
As soon as the race starts,
I'm gonna go right back there.

501
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:31,784
Excuse me.

502
00:27:31,784 --> 00:27:34,987
And is
the oldest in continuous use.

503
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:38,224
While the horses are parading
to the post in front of you,

504
00:27:38,224 --> 00:27:42,929
may I remind you of the always
superb post flamingo day dinner

505
00:27:42,929 --> 00:27:44,530
to be held tonight.

506
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:47,599
Details may be obtained
at the information center.

507
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:50,469
There. Isn't
that beautiful?

508
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:52,839
Marvelous,
marvelous.

509
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:57,009
Yeah, there he is.
That's him.

510
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:59,045
All right. He looks
very good. Nice and calm.

511
00:27:59,045 --> 00:28:00,279
That's a good sign.

512
00:28:01,547 --> 00:28:04,116
What a beautiful
sight this is each year.

513
00:28:04,116 --> 00:28:05,484
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

514
00:28:05,484 --> 00:28:07,686
we'll run down the horses
once again for you.

515
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:08,955
Number one, she's a lady.

516
00:28:08,955 --> 00:28:11,423
Number 2 horse
is Dolly's chance.

517
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:12,959
T.t.'s baby is number 3.

518
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:16,829
Small virtue is number 4,
with Sunday's child, number 5.

519
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:19,365
Number 6 horse is man stomper.

520
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:20,967
Number 7, perdition.

521
00:28:20,967 --> 00:28:23,635
And Billy b.
Is the number 8 horse.

522
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:25,371
She's a lady,
the number one horse

523
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:27,073
being led into the gate.

524
00:28:27,073 --> 00:28:30,109
And now here comes
Dolly's chance.

525
00:28:30,109 --> 00:28:31,477
See the way he done that?

526
00:28:31,477 --> 00:28:33,645
That's perfect, Jeff.
He's doing perfect.

527
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:34,781
He's in the starting
gate now.

528
00:28:34,781 --> 00:28:36,115
He's relaxed,
the horse is nice.

529
00:28:36,115 --> 00:28:37,850
He's in good
shape, see? Yeah.

530
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:44,390
The flag is up.

531
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:45,391
Let's be ready.

532
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:48,127
All right, let's go!

533
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:00,940
All right, that's it, Jeff!

534
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,608
Hold him right there.
Don't give him his head.

535
00:29:02,608 --> 00:29:03,843
Hold him back!

536
00:29:03,843 --> 00:29:05,644
Perdition around the turn,

537
00:29:05,644 --> 00:29:08,714
Dolly's chance head-to-head
with Sunday's child.

538
00:29:08,714 --> 00:29:10,616
She's a lady,
she's a lady.

539
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:12,251
Come on.

540
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:15,554
She's a lady.
Man stomper is the sixth horse.

541
00:29:15,554 --> 00:29:17,456
And t.T.'S baby, small virtue.

542
00:29:17,456 --> 00:29:19,826
Yeah, come on!

543
00:29:19,826 --> 00:29:21,828
Hold it right there, Jeff!

544
00:29:21,828 --> 00:29:23,395
Don't let her
make the move yet!

545
00:29:23,395 --> 00:29:26,765
But she's a lady
is burning up that track.

546
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,667
She's a lady is flying.

547
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:30,736
She's a lady.
Come on!

548
00:29:30,736 --> 00:29:32,571
Stop that, Annie.

549
00:29:32,571 --> 00:29:34,073
Who are you
rooting for, anyway?

550
00:29:34,073 --> 00:29:37,109
But, Dolly,
look at her.

551
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:39,245
Man stomper making a run now

552
00:29:39,245 --> 00:29:42,681
at she's a lady. Man stomper
trying to get up there.

553
00:29:42,681 --> 00:29:45,784
She's a lady, man stomper...

554
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,389
Ohh!

555
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:51,858
She's a lady.

556
00:29:51,858 --> 00:29:54,226
And now,
running for home...

557
00:29:54,226 --> 00:29:56,262
Look at him!
Look at him!

558
00:29:56,262 --> 00:29:58,931
Look at him!
Look!

559
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:02,401
She's in second.

560
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:07,139
Sunday's child
trying to hold onto third.

561
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:08,841
And she's a lady falls down.

562
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:12,945
Aah! Dad!

563
00:30:14,346 --> 00:30:17,049
Oh, oh, damn it.

564
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:19,218
It's the boy's horse.

565
00:30:38,437 --> 00:30:40,239
That's Billy.

566
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:44,376
That...

567
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:47,179
That's Billy

568
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:49,581
down there with that boy.

569
00:31:09,735 --> 00:31:11,470
Is t.J...

570
00:31:12,471 --> 00:31:13,472
Him?

571
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:32,024
The horse was going
to win that race.

572
00:31:32,024 --> 00:31:34,026
I'll keep her
no matter what--

573
00:31:34,026 --> 00:31:36,562
even if she can't
run no more.

574
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:39,165
I'll--I'll--
I'll brush her,

575
00:31:39,165 --> 00:31:43,035
and--and I'll feed her
every day.

576
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:01,187
Yeah. Yeah.

577
00:32:26,012 --> 00:32:27,213
What are you doing here?

578
00:32:33,719 --> 00:32:35,821
How's the horse?
Is the horse all right?

579
00:32:35,821 --> 00:32:37,056
The horse is just fine.

580
00:32:37,056 --> 00:32:38,424
In 5 minutes,
they'll probably shoot.

581
00:32:45,097 --> 00:32:46,665
Stop it. Stop it.

582
00:32:46,665 --> 00:32:48,834
Stop it!

583
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:51,303
It doesn't work
anymore, Billy.

584
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:52,638
What do you mean,
it doesn't work anymore?

585
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:54,773
It doesn't work any--

586
00:32:54,773 --> 00:32:57,143
just like old times, huh?

587
00:32:57,143 --> 00:33:00,279
What are you
doing here now?

588
00:33:07,453 --> 00:33:09,188
No smoking
in the barn area.

589
00:33:09,188 --> 00:33:11,390
What do you want?

590
00:33:14,193 --> 00:33:16,195
T.j. Is Timmy, isn't he?

591
00:33:17,796 --> 00:33:19,231
Yeah, t.J. Is Timmy.

592
00:33:19,231 --> 00:33:20,599
So you figured it out.
So what?

593
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:22,468
Even a dumb horse
knows her own foal.

594
00:33:22,468 --> 00:33:25,671
Don't you think one of us
ought to be with him now?

595
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:26,672
If he's out there--

596
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:28,174
one of us--
one of us--

597
00:33:28,174 --> 00:33:31,943
yeah, one of us is.
One of us was.

598
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:33,312
Billy!

599
00:33:33,312 --> 00:33:36,215
You dropped your purse.

600
00:33:36,215 --> 00:33:39,085
Billy, will you
stop it, please?

601
00:33:39,085 --> 00:33:42,121
What do you want to do,
hold his hand?

602
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:43,889
You know what I told him?

603
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:45,023
I told him you had died,

604
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,093
that you were killed
in a car wreck,

605
00:33:47,093 --> 00:33:48,227
that you were a tramp,

606
00:33:48,227 --> 00:33:52,431
that we were better off
without you.

607
00:33:52,431 --> 00:33:54,733
You're dead,
you understand that?

608
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:56,102
You're dead.

609
00:33:56,102 --> 00:33:58,237
The kid's got no mother.

610
00:34:02,174 --> 00:34:03,375
I am his mother.

611
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:05,111
You're dead.
He's got no mother.

612
00:34:05,111 --> 00:34:07,546
I'm here.
I am his mother.

613
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:09,815
You gave me custody,
didn't you?

614
00:34:09,815 --> 00:34:11,550
And you got what you wanted.

615
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,751
Now get the hell
out of here.

616
00:34:12,751 --> 00:34:14,920
Billy.

617
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,722
Billy, please.

618
00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:18,124
I'd just like
to see him.

619
00:34:18,124 --> 00:34:19,458
I'd like to know
what he's like.

620
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:20,826
You want to know
what he's like? Take a look.

621
00:34:20,826 --> 00:34:22,761
He's the one-in-a-million kid
you dream about.

622
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:24,563
That's what he's like.
You ain't going to see him--

623
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:28,200
not now, not never. Come on,
let's get out of here.

624
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,301
Let's get out of here.

625
00:34:29,301 --> 00:34:31,670
Billy, stop it!

626
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,175
You want me
to get a lawyer?

627
00:34:36,175 --> 00:34:37,409
You want to do that?

628
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:38,444
No.

629
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:42,047
No, I don't want
to do that,

630
00:34:42,047 --> 00:34:43,249
but you know
as well as I do

631
00:34:43,249 --> 00:34:44,383
that no court
in the country

632
00:34:44,383 --> 00:34:46,152
would deny me the right
to see him.

633
00:34:46,152 --> 00:34:48,754
Superficial wound,
nothing more.

634
00:34:50,156 --> 00:34:51,323
He's going to be all right?

635
00:34:53,725 --> 00:34:55,026
Ok.

636
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:56,228
Champ.

637
00:34:57,163 --> 00:34:59,631
Champ!
Where's the champ?

638
00:35:00,966 --> 00:35:02,468
Champ! Champ!

639
00:35:04,303 --> 00:35:06,472
Champ, where are you?

640
00:35:07,906 --> 00:35:09,175
He's ok. He's ok!

641
00:35:09,175 --> 00:35:10,842
That's wonderful.

642
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:12,311
Champ...

643
00:35:12,311 --> 00:35:15,314
The doctor said
it's a superficial wound.

644
00:35:15,314 --> 00:35:16,482
Get that?
Superficial wound.

645
00:35:16,482 --> 00:35:17,483
Yeah. Come on,
let's go.

646
00:35:17,483 --> 00:35:18,750
He's going to be ok.

647
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,118
Oh, t.J., I'm glad.

648
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,720
I saw it from the stands.
I was worried.

649
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,889
Come on.

650
00:35:23,889 --> 00:35:25,191
T.j.?

651
00:35:26,192 --> 00:35:30,762
Uh, we have this
other matter to discuss.

652
00:35:32,998 --> 00:35:35,867
I bet on her.

653
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:38,270
You owe me
a flat 10 bucks.

654
00:35:44,176 --> 00:35:46,445
The name's Annie.

655
00:35:54,953 --> 00:35:59,425
Yeah, well, it's nice
to meet you, Annie.

656
00:35:59,425 --> 00:36:01,993
Maybe I'll take you up
on that invitation sometime.

657
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,028
Are you happy, champ?

658
00:36:03,028 --> 00:36:04,296
Yeah, yeah, I'm happy.

659
00:36:04,296 --> 00:36:06,532
I'm happy. I'm happy.
I'm happy.

660
00:36:06,532 --> 00:36:08,166
Come on.

661
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:27,386
Why do we have to go?

662
00:36:27,386 --> 00:36:29,588
Because it's fun.

663
00:36:33,158 --> 00:36:35,394
You know, people...

664
00:36:35,394 --> 00:36:38,196
People inviting
other people over.

665
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,335
Why do we have
to be dressed up?

666
00:36:44,836 --> 00:36:47,138
Because...

667
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:49,541
Because these people
are rich people.

668
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:50,876
You want to look nice,
don't you?

669
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:51,877
You look nice.

670
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:53,879
You look real nice.

671
00:36:56,682 --> 00:36:58,750
Why did she ask me
about the $10?

672
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:01,887
Hey, what is this,
question day?

673
00:37:03,289 --> 00:37:04,690
I told you about that.

674
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:06,091
She didn't mean
nothing by that.

675
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:07,693
It's just...

676
00:37:07,693 --> 00:37:09,227
Her little
sense of humor.

677
00:37:10,762 --> 00:37:12,998
Some sense of humor.

678
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:34,986
Ok, come on, let's go.

679
00:37:40,326 --> 00:37:42,728
I forgot. I got to make
a phone call.

680
00:37:42,728 --> 00:37:43,862
Hey, look...

681
00:37:43,862 --> 00:37:45,964
Here. I want you
to go up there, see?

682
00:37:45,964 --> 00:37:48,767
Let's see. Let's see
if your hair's nice.

683
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:49,601
Good.

684
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:51,269
Ok, that's it.
Go ahead.

685
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,471
Go ahead.

686
00:37:52,471 --> 00:37:53,505
I'll see you
in 20 minutes. Go ahead.

687
00:37:53,505 --> 00:37:54,606
See you in 20 minutes.

688
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,508
Hey, hold it.
Wait just a second.

689
00:37:56,508 --> 00:37:57,743
That'd be beautiful,

690
00:37:57,743 --> 00:38:00,312
walking in with 37.50
on your sleeve, huh?

691
00:38:00,312 --> 00:38:02,548
All right, go ahead.

692
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,252
Go ahead. Come on.

693
00:38:07,252 --> 00:38:08,620
Have a good time.

694
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,424
Be back.

695
00:38:12,424 --> 00:38:15,060
Yeah. I'll be back
in 20 minutes.

696
00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:41,853
Mrs. Phillips
is waiting for you down there.

697
00:38:41,853 --> 00:38:42,854
Thank you.

698
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:43,922
You're welcome.

699
00:38:44,956 --> 00:38:45,957
Hi, t.J.

700
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:47,559
Hi, Annie.

701
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,796
Where'd your father go?

702
00:38:50,796 --> 00:38:52,498
He had to make
a telephone call.

703
00:38:52,498 --> 00:38:54,600
He'll be right back
in 20 minutes.

704
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,734
Ok.

705
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,538
How's the filly?

706
00:38:59,538 --> 00:39:01,006
Oh, she's ok.

707
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:03,141
She's getting better
and better every day.

708
00:39:03,141 --> 00:39:04,643
Is she really?

709
00:39:04,643 --> 00:39:05,544
Yep.

710
00:39:05,544 --> 00:39:08,480
When do you start
working her out?

711
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,916
We'll be working her out
in a couple weeks.

712
00:39:10,916 --> 00:39:12,250
In 2 weeks?

713
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,251
Uh-huh.

714
00:39:13,251 --> 00:39:14,319
That's amazing, t.J.

715
00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:15,754
That's wonderful.

716
00:39:15,754 --> 00:39:18,056
We're going to start
entering a couple of races,

717
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:20,459
and then we're going to start
collecting the dough.

718
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,994
Mrs. Phillips,
you have a phone call.

719
00:39:22,994 --> 00:39:25,263
Will you take a message?
I'll call them back later.

720
00:39:25,263 --> 00:39:26,765
He said it was
an emergency.

721
00:39:27,899 --> 00:39:29,568
All right, Bob.

722
00:39:32,604 --> 00:39:34,473
You know what
an emergency is, t.J.?

723
00:39:34,473 --> 00:39:37,409
It's anything
that they can't handle.

724
00:39:37,409 --> 00:39:38,610
Mike...

725
00:39:39,745 --> 00:39:41,146
Uh...

726
00:39:41,146 --> 00:39:44,115
Mike--t.j., I'd like you
to meet my husband.

727
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:46,317
This is Mike.

728
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:47,318
Mike, this is t.J.

729
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:48,319
Hello, t.J.

730
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:49,655
Hi.

731
00:39:49,655 --> 00:39:51,389
Do you think you two
can keep each other company

732
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,424
for just a few minutes?

733
00:39:52,424 --> 00:39:53,425
There's a phone call.

734
00:39:53,425 --> 00:39:54,660
Ok.

735
00:39:55,494 --> 00:39:57,028
Sit down.

736
00:39:59,931 --> 00:40:01,132
So...

737
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:02,768
Your filly's going
to be all right, huh?

738
00:40:02,768 --> 00:40:04,369
She's going to be fine.

739
00:40:04,369 --> 00:40:07,105
The vet said she didn't
even swell up.

740
00:40:07,105 --> 00:40:08,106
Good.

741
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,183
Excuse me.

742
00:40:18,183 --> 00:40:19,184
Um...

743
00:40:20,185 --> 00:40:21,687
Can I talk to you
honest?

744
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:25,423
Sure.

745
00:40:35,701 --> 00:40:38,937
Annie--Annie
don't understand.

746
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:41,573
When you lose a bet,
you lose a bet.

747
00:40:43,509 --> 00:40:45,443
You mean...

748
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,412
She wants the money back?

749
00:40:47,412 --> 00:40:48,814
Exactly.

750
00:40:48,814 --> 00:40:52,951
Do you want me
to talk to her?

751
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:54,019
Hmm?

752
00:40:54,019 --> 00:40:55,554
Don't you think
you should talk to her?

753
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,893
I guess so.

754
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:25,751
Who's he?

755
00:41:26,952 --> 00:41:28,554
Oh, his name
was Thomas parr,

756
00:41:28,554 --> 00:41:30,522
and he was
an english farmer.

757
00:41:30,522 --> 00:41:33,525
He was very famous
because he lived to be 153--

758
00:41:33,525 --> 00:41:37,028
the oldest man
who ever lived.

759
00:41:37,028 --> 00:41:38,129
No kidding.

760
00:41:38,129 --> 00:41:41,533
And he might've lived
who knows how long,

761
00:41:41,533 --> 00:41:43,569
only they took him
to London

762
00:41:43,569 --> 00:41:45,303
to show him to the king.

763
00:41:45,303 --> 00:41:47,939
What happened
in London?

764
00:41:47,939 --> 00:41:51,342
He ate and drank
himself to death.

765
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:54,613
How could he live
to be 153?

766
00:41:54,613 --> 00:41:56,447
That's what I try
to figure out--

767
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:58,483
why people get old

768
00:41:58,483 --> 00:42:00,485
and why some people
like Thomas parr

769
00:42:00,485 --> 00:42:01,787
live so long

770
00:42:01,787 --> 00:42:03,589
and other people don't.

771
00:42:04,923 --> 00:42:06,124
Uh...

772
00:42:06,124 --> 00:42:08,326
Are--are you...

773
00:42:08,326 --> 00:42:10,228
A doctor?

774
00:42:10,228 --> 00:42:11,897
Mmm, sort of.

775
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:14,065
A gerontologist.

776
00:42:18,937 --> 00:42:20,606
How are you two
getting along?

777
00:42:20,606 --> 00:42:22,608
Oh, we've been
having a great talk.

778
00:42:22,608 --> 00:42:24,342
What are you
talking about?

779
00:42:24,342 --> 00:42:26,878
Old man parr.

780
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:32,550
T.j., that--that was
your father on the phone.

781
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,720
A friend of his
is in some kind of trouble,

782
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,255
and he won't be able
to be back until 6:30.

783
00:42:37,255 --> 00:42:40,058
Well, it's not
that bad here, you know.

784
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:41,960
Do you want to see
around the boat?

785
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,161
Come on,
I'll show you around.

786
00:42:43,161 --> 00:42:44,763
All right?

787
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,405
Did he say
which friend was in trouble?

788
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:57,075
He didn't, but he said
it wasn't important,

789
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:58,443
and that he'd be back
in a few hours.

790
00:42:58,443 --> 00:43:01,079
Now, don't worry about it.
Do you like boats?

791
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:01,913
Oh, yeah.

792
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:02,981
Well, t.J.,
look at that one.

793
00:43:02,981 --> 00:43:05,483
Oh, wow, that's pretty.

794
00:43:05,483 --> 00:43:06,517
Isn't it?

795
00:43:06,517 --> 00:43:10,055
Look how many people
there are.

796
00:43:10,055 --> 00:43:11,322
Wow.

797
00:43:16,728 --> 00:43:18,664
Look at that one.
That's pretty, too.

798
00:43:31,743 --> 00:43:34,245
Ah, I tell you, wow.

799
00:43:34,245 --> 00:43:37,282
I wish that Jack
could see that one.

800
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:39,117
He'd love it.

801
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:49,394
Hey...

802
00:43:49,394 --> 00:43:51,830
You're pretty damn good.

803
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:53,631
You a hustler?

804
00:43:54,432 --> 00:43:56,434
Naw, I'm just lucky.

805
00:43:56,434 --> 00:43:59,637
Oh. Well,
try her again, then.

806
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,909
Naw.
What do I get?

807
00:44:03,909 --> 00:44:05,677
Anything you say.

808
00:44:05,677 --> 00:44:06,945
Anything I say?

809
00:44:06,945 --> 00:44:09,715
All right,
anything I say.

810
00:44:09,715 --> 00:44:13,852
Right here. How about
this one right here?

811
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:16,421
There you are.

812
00:44:16,421 --> 00:44:18,757
Are you sure you don't want
to try that again?

813
00:44:18,757 --> 00:44:20,859
Once more?

814
00:44:20,859 --> 00:44:23,194
Yeah, I'm sure.

815
00:44:23,194 --> 00:44:24,730
I tried.

816
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:26,932
You're
a sweetheart, too.

817
00:44:42,047 --> 00:44:44,249
I caught you.

818
00:44:46,351 --> 00:44:47,352
Oh!

819
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:53,291
Oh!

820
00:45:10,075 --> 00:45:12,878
I'm going to attack you!

821
00:46:19,945 --> 00:46:21,712
Now, you keep
that blanket on.

822
00:46:21,712 --> 00:46:23,849
Don't worry,
I will.

823
00:46:23,849 --> 00:46:25,183
Remember where
the saddle is from.

824
00:46:25,183 --> 00:46:26,484
That's from england.

825
00:46:26,484 --> 00:46:29,120
Don't lose the halter.
It's expensive.

826
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,521
Don't worry, I won't.

827
00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:33,258
Now, you take care
of your filly, you promise?

828
00:46:33,258 --> 00:46:34,059
I promise.

829
00:46:34,059 --> 00:46:35,293
Who's your vet?

830
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:36,361
Doc.

831
00:46:36,361 --> 00:46:38,897
What the hell kind of name
is doc for a vet?

832
00:46:39,965 --> 00:46:41,532
Listen, if something
goes wrong,

833
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:43,068
you call me, understand?

834
00:46:43,068 --> 00:46:45,370
I got the best vet
in the world.

835
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:48,473
Sure. Don't worry,
Dolly, I will.

836
00:46:48,473 --> 00:46:49,474
Bye, love.

837
00:46:49,474 --> 00:46:50,475
Bye.

838
00:46:51,609 --> 00:46:52,610
Bye, t.J.

839
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:53,912
Bye.

840
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:00,518
Annie.

841
00:47:04,722 --> 00:47:07,292
Thanks for going
swimming with me.

842
00:47:07,292 --> 00:47:10,395
The champ
won't let me go alone.

843
00:47:10,395 --> 00:47:11,462
And...

844
00:47:11,462 --> 00:47:12,864
When you go away,

845
00:47:12,864 --> 00:47:15,466
I'll always remember
this day.

846
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:30,781
Bye, t.J.

847
00:47:30,781 --> 00:47:32,517
Here.

848
00:47:32,517 --> 00:47:33,518
Bye, Annie.

849
00:47:33,518 --> 00:47:34,519
Bye.

850
00:47:36,321 --> 00:47:39,257
Any time you want,
come to the backstretch,

851
00:47:39,257 --> 00:47:41,126
and then--and then
I'll show you around.

852
00:47:41,126 --> 00:47:42,693
You could see my horse.

853
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:43,794
Bye.

854
00:47:43,794 --> 00:47:46,131
The champ must be
waiting for me.

855
00:47:54,405 --> 00:47:56,407
Bye. Bye, Annie.

856
00:48:13,258 --> 00:48:14,359
Champ!

857
00:48:18,796 --> 00:48:22,000
Ah, t.J.,
I must've conked out.

858
00:48:22,968 --> 00:48:25,170
Did you get
a lot of presents?

859
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:27,105
Yeah. Look--
look at this saddle.

860
00:48:27,105 --> 00:48:28,439
Look at it.
Look at it.

861
00:48:28,439 --> 00:48:29,407
Saddle.

862
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:31,242
It must've cost
200 bucks.

863
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:33,678
Look at that. Feel it.
That's real leather.

864
00:48:33,678 --> 00:48:34,980
I'm looking.
It's--

865
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:36,914
yeah, well, they spoil you
silly in there.

866
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:37,915
I can see that.

867
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:39,184
They were real
nice people,

868
00:48:39,184 --> 00:48:41,519
not like most
turf clubbers.

869
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:43,054
They didn't have
their nose in the air.

870
00:48:43,054 --> 00:48:44,255
Oh, I'm glad of that.

871
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:45,790
Look at this halter.
Look at that halter.

872
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:49,094
Look at this. It even
says "she's a lady."

873
00:48:49,094 --> 00:48:51,862
Oh, yeah.
Look at that.

874
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:53,999
Yeah. I'd rather have
a rope halter.

875
00:48:53,999 --> 00:48:57,002
You don't have
to clean it so much.

876
00:48:57,002 --> 00:49:00,238
Yeah, this is nice.
It's nice.

877
00:49:00,238 --> 00:49:01,739
Annie was very nice.

878
00:49:01,739 --> 00:49:03,141
Guess what
her husband is?

879
00:49:03,141 --> 00:49:04,909
What's that?

880
00:49:04,909 --> 00:49:06,511
A geritologist.

881
00:49:06,511 --> 00:49:07,612
Oh...

882
00:49:07,612 --> 00:49:09,580
A geri-what?

883
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:11,016
Uh, a doctor.

884
00:49:13,484 --> 00:49:16,221
The old lady
was rich, but nice.

885
00:49:17,188 --> 00:49:18,489
Close the door, will you?

886
00:49:22,527 --> 00:49:24,362
Oh, they have
a beautiful boat,

887
00:49:24,362 --> 00:49:27,165
and--and then I went
swimming with Annie.

888
00:49:27,165 --> 00:49:28,533
We had such fun.

889
00:49:28,533 --> 00:49:30,468
I wish you could've
been there with us.

890
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:32,570
What happened, champ?
Where were you?

891
00:49:43,748 --> 00:49:44,749
Come on, Billy.

892
00:49:44,749 --> 00:49:45,816
One more time.

893
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,585
Another roll.

894
00:49:56,927 --> 00:49:58,296
7.

895
00:49:58,296 --> 00:50:01,766
One more.
Come on, baby.

896
00:50:03,634 --> 00:50:06,671
Hey, what do you need
when you walk down Broadway?

897
00:50:06,671 --> 00:50:07,738
What?

898
00:50:07,738 --> 00:50:09,674
A .44.

899
00:50:09,674 --> 00:50:10,675
Come on.

900
00:50:12,043 --> 00:50:13,811
44!

901
00:50:13,811 --> 00:50:15,446
44!

902
00:50:18,483 --> 00:50:22,587
And now I'm going
to take a leak.

903
00:50:24,122 --> 00:50:25,223
Bobby's going
to roll for me.

904
00:50:25,223 --> 00:50:27,292
Watch my chips,
will you?

905
00:50:27,292 --> 00:50:30,695
Come on, come on.

906
00:50:30,695 --> 00:50:31,862
Hey, Billy.

907
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:33,931
Hey, Roy, your friend's
in there cleaning up.

908
00:50:33,931 --> 00:50:34,932
What's up, Billy?

909
00:50:34,932 --> 00:50:36,167
Me?

910
00:50:41,106 --> 00:50:43,308
There you go.

911
00:50:53,251 --> 00:50:55,453
Just ask for Billy.

912
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:06,664
Get me a beer,
will you, Phil?

913
00:51:06,664 --> 00:51:07,632
That beer's good.

914
00:51:07,632 --> 00:51:08,833
Ok, Billy,
coming right up.

915
00:51:08,833 --> 00:51:10,435
Right there. Ok?

916
00:51:11,602 --> 00:51:13,871
Billy Flynn?

917
00:51:13,871 --> 00:51:15,640
Yeah,
who wants to know?

918
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:16,441
You a cop?

919
00:51:16,441 --> 00:51:18,543
No. I'm
Mike Phillips.

920
00:51:19,544 --> 00:51:21,712
You look like a cop,
you know that, Mike?

921
00:51:21,712 --> 00:51:23,281
You got just a minute?
I'd like to talk to you.

922
00:51:23,281 --> 00:51:25,416
Not now, Mikey.
I'm a-winning.

923
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:27,218
I'm Annie's husband.

924
00:51:31,856 --> 00:51:33,458
Just a minute?

925
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:37,027
Yeah, yeah, all right.

926
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:38,229
Uh...

927
00:51:39,164 --> 00:51:40,465
Let's find someplace.

928
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,408
We have
a little problem.

929
00:51:50,408 --> 00:51:52,843
No, we don't have
a problem.

930
00:51:52,843 --> 00:51:54,912
I got rid of that problem
several years ago.

931
00:51:54,912 --> 00:51:56,714
You got the problem.

932
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:02,387
I really want to talk
about the boy.

933
00:52:07,558 --> 00:52:09,360
What did she do,
cry a little bit

934
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:10,695
for you to come down here?

935
00:52:10,695 --> 00:52:12,197
You know, you can be
in a lot of trouble

936
00:52:12,197 --> 00:52:15,300
messing around
in other people's business.

937
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,702
I'm married to
the mother of your son.

938
00:52:17,702 --> 00:52:19,337
You don't like that,
but that's the way it is.

939
00:52:19,337 --> 00:52:21,639
I'll tell you
the way it is.

940
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:23,073
T.j. Is a healthy,
happy kid,

941
00:52:23,073 --> 00:52:25,210
and he's going
to stay that way.

942
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:26,444
The track is the greatest
place in the world

943
00:52:26,444 --> 00:52:27,445
for a kid to grow up.

944
00:52:27,445 --> 00:52:28,813
Oh, I agree with you.

945
00:52:30,215 --> 00:52:32,483
Oh, you agree with me?

946
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:34,485
Beautiful place
for a kid to grow up.

947
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:35,920
It's a kind
of a paradise.

948
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,288
When I saw t.J.,
I thought,

949
00:52:37,288 --> 00:52:38,989
"my god, what
a wonderful child."

950
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:40,057
My hats off to you,
Billy.

951
00:52:40,057 --> 00:52:42,260
You've been
a great father.

952
00:52:45,663 --> 00:52:47,232
Well...

953
00:52:47,232 --> 00:52:49,234
Anyway, he knows
his manners.

954
00:52:49,234 --> 00:52:50,901
I got to go.
I'm on a hot streak.

955
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:52,637
Wait. Wait.

956
00:52:53,804 --> 00:52:56,241
There's more to it,
isn't there?

957
00:52:56,241 --> 00:52:58,309
I mean...

958
00:52:58,309 --> 00:53:00,845
He does have a mother.

959
00:53:00,845 --> 00:53:02,447
He's got no mother.

960
00:53:06,384 --> 00:53:08,553
You going to decide
for him?

961
00:53:08,553 --> 00:53:13,090
It's up to him
to make up his own mind.

962
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:14,325
I got to go.

963
00:53:16,994 --> 00:53:19,530
Let me just ask you this--

964
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:21,666
t.j. Won't always be
8-years-old.

965
00:53:21,666 --> 00:53:23,834
He's a very bright
little boy.

966
00:53:23,834 --> 00:53:26,471
What happens when he finds out
that he has a mother,

967
00:53:26,471 --> 00:53:28,973
and that she loves him,

968
00:53:28,973 --> 00:53:30,675
and that she wanted
to be with him sometimes,

969
00:53:30,675 --> 00:53:32,610
only you wouldn't
let that happen?

970
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:34,345
How are you going
to handle that?

971
00:53:34,345 --> 00:53:36,281
Some goddamn mother.

972
00:53:36,281 --> 00:53:37,315
She never does
nothing for him,

973
00:53:37,315 --> 00:53:38,716
and now after 7 years,

974
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:40,285
it's, "oh, my, oh, my,
I just love him so much.

975
00:53:40,285 --> 00:53:41,719
I just never knew it."

976
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:44,121
Never did she
change his pants

977
00:53:44,121 --> 00:53:45,523
or wipe his nose,

978
00:53:45,523 --> 00:53:47,191
teach him his prayers,
tell him right from wrong,

979
00:53:47,191 --> 00:53:49,159
give him a bath.

980
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:52,297
But what difference
does that make?

981
00:53:52,297 --> 00:53:53,498
Some goddamn mother.

982
00:54:14,885 --> 00:54:16,454
Good night, gents.

983
00:54:16,454 --> 00:54:17,888
Good night.

984
00:54:17,888 --> 00:54:18,889
Good night.

985
00:54:18,889 --> 00:54:20,891
Good night.

986
00:54:20,891 --> 00:54:21,959
A horse?

987
00:54:21,959 --> 00:54:25,195
What am I going to do
with a goddamn horse?

988
00:54:25,195 --> 00:54:26,664
That horse
cost me 6,000.

989
00:54:26,664 --> 00:54:28,899
I don't care
what it cost.

990
00:54:28,899 --> 00:54:30,501
Tell you what--

991
00:54:31,936 --> 00:54:33,938
you bring me...

992
00:54:33,938 --> 00:54:35,573
$2,000...

993
00:54:36,941 --> 00:54:38,909
Within 48 hours...

994
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:44,649
Or I'll take
the goddamn horse.

995
00:54:44,649 --> 00:54:46,050
All right?

996
00:54:53,758 --> 00:54:56,126
I bought that horse
for my kid.

997
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,662
It's going to break
his heart.

998
00:54:57,662 --> 00:55:01,366
Billy, I don't want
to break a kid's heart.

999
00:55:01,366 --> 00:55:04,969
I got a kid of my own.

1000
00:55:09,807 --> 00:55:10,975
Ok.

1001
00:55:11,776 --> 00:55:14,111
I'll get you
the money.

1002
00:55:14,111 --> 00:55:15,245
Right.

1003
00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:17,114
I'll get you
the money somehow.

1004
00:55:17,114 --> 00:55:18,315
Right.

1005
00:55:30,995 --> 00:55:32,697
Hello, Harold.

1006
00:55:32,697 --> 00:55:34,331
Billy.

1007
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:35,800
Billy Flynn.

1008
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,669
Yeah, listen, about
the thousand dollars...

1009
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:42,039
About the thousand dollars
you owe me.

1010
00:55:42,039 --> 00:55:46,944
Harold, don't talk to me
like that. Come on.

1011
00:55:46,944 --> 00:55:48,879
Couldn't you work out
something?

1012
00:55:48,879 --> 00:55:53,150
I mean, there must be something
you could work out.

1013
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:56,153
Yeah? Who do you think
you're talking to?

1014
00:55:56,153 --> 00:55:57,287
Harold, I see you
at the track.

1015
00:55:57,287 --> 00:55:58,689
You're no stranger
out here.

1016
00:55:58,689 --> 00:56:02,560
I see you with the ladies.
You spend a lot of money.

1017
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:07,632
You got a lot of weight
in your pockets, kid.

1018
00:56:07,632 --> 00:56:09,700
Look, I wouldn't
call you if I didn't--

1019
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,569
if this wasn't important,
I wouldn't call you.

1020
00:56:11,569 --> 00:56:13,303
All right, you little--
look, you little weasel,

1021
00:56:13,303 --> 00:56:15,039
i--i carried you--

1022
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:16,541
i--i!

1023
00:57:25,943 --> 00:57:28,078
The designers
of the thirties

1024
00:57:28,078 --> 00:57:31,048
rediscovered the beauty
of the shape of a woman.

1025
00:57:31,048 --> 00:57:33,383
They returned to languor,
to sensuality.

1026
00:57:33,383 --> 00:57:35,920
They gave women
a sense of their bodies,

1027
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,155
and draped them

1028
00:57:38,155 --> 00:57:39,356
in satin,

1029
00:57:39,356 --> 00:57:41,025
silk,

1030
00:57:41,025 --> 00:57:43,260
fur and filigree,

1031
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:44,862
clinging velvet,

1032
00:57:44,862 --> 00:57:46,531
quantities
of costume jewelry,

1033
00:57:46,531 --> 00:57:47,932
sequins, veils,

1034
00:57:47,932 --> 00:57:49,567
and...

1035
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:51,435
Feathers.

1036
00:57:51,435 --> 00:57:54,371
Uh, vionnet...

1037
00:57:54,371 --> 00:57:56,340
Vionnet
was the first designer

1038
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:58,475
to, uh, completely master

1039
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:00,578
the art
of the bias-cut dress.

1040
00:58:00,578 --> 00:58:04,148
She created clothes
that clung to the body...

1041
00:58:04,148 --> 00:58:06,617
And yet moved freely.

1042
00:58:09,086 --> 00:58:12,289
There is one designer
in the history of fashion

1043
00:58:12,289 --> 00:58:14,224
who stands alone,

1044
00:58:14,224 --> 00:58:16,827
whose instincts for the needs
of the contemporary woman

1045
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:20,097
pulled fashion irrevocably
into the 20th century

1046
00:58:20,097 --> 00:58:23,400
and showed the world
that comfortable

1047
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,802
could be glamorous.

1048
00:58:24,802 --> 00:58:27,304
The Chanel revolution

1049
00:58:27,304 --> 00:58:30,040
gave women a total look

1050
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:31,709
for day and evening.

1051
00:58:31,709 --> 00:58:34,311
And always
with her perfect sense

1052
00:58:34,311 --> 00:58:35,846
of balance and proportion,

1053
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:38,816
which we see in this classic
dinner suit.

1054
00:58:38,816 --> 00:58:41,719
Piccard, vionnet, lanvin,
Chanel--

1055
00:58:41,719 --> 00:58:44,188
they were the dressmakers
of Paris.

1056
00:58:44,188 --> 00:58:46,423
They were also artists.

1057
00:58:46,423 --> 00:58:49,126
Historians, photographers,
and museums are teaching us

1058
00:58:49,126 --> 00:58:52,062
that fashion,
like painting and sculpture,

1059
00:58:52,062 --> 00:58:53,598
is an art.

1060
00:58:53,598 --> 00:58:54,599
Fashion.

1061
00:58:54,599 --> 00:58:56,867
What people choose to wear

1062
00:58:56,867 --> 00:59:01,005
has and always will
reflect a time

1063
00:59:01,005 --> 00:59:04,675
and express
a way of living.

1064
00:59:20,591 --> 00:59:22,192
You were marvelous.

1065
00:59:22,192 --> 00:59:23,193
Hello, Nikki.

1066
00:59:23,193 --> 00:59:24,595
I'll be back.

1067
00:59:24,595 --> 00:59:25,596
Billy?

1068
00:59:25,596 --> 00:59:27,364
Billy, wait.

1069
00:59:27,364 --> 00:59:28,766
It was stupid
my coming here.

1070
00:59:28,766 --> 00:59:30,300
I don't know
why I did it.

1071
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:31,568
Uh, it was...

1072
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:32,703
Crazy.

1073
00:59:32,703 --> 00:59:34,304
Timmy's all right,
isn't he?

1074
00:59:34,304 --> 00:59:36,406
T.j.'s fine.

1075
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:37,975
I need a favor.

1076
00:59:37,975 --> 00:59:39,509
You know,
all those guys--

1077
00:59:39,509 --> 00:59:42,312
remember when I was on top,
I was a certain kind of guy.

1078
00:59:42,312 --> 00:59:44,181
Now people forget me.

1079
00:59:45,515 --> 00:59:47,918
You don't wanna hear this.
What am I talkin' about?

1080
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:48,719
Billy.

1081
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:50,788
Billy, uh...

1082
00:59:51,856 --> 00:59:54,191
Why don't you tell me
and let me decide?

1083
00:59:56,193 --> 00:59:57,327
$2,000.

1084
00:59:57,327 --> 00:59:59,229
I need $2,000.

1085
01:00:06,003 --> 01:00:07,004
Ok.

1086
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,012
It's no big deal.

1087
01:00:15,012 --> 01:00:16,747
I want you
to understand that.

1088
01:00:16,747 --> 01:00:18,148
It don't make
no difference to me

1089
01:00:18,148 --> 01:00:19,750
if you give me
the money or not.

1090
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:21,886
I still feel the same way
about what you did.

1091
01:00:23,754 --> 01:00:26,757
I don't know when
I can pay you back.

1092
01:00:26,757 --> 01:00:28,358
It doesn't matter.

1093
01:00:30,761 --> 01:00:32,763
I'm glad
you're doing this.

1094
01:00:32,763 --> 01:00:34,765
What are you
talkin' about?

1095
01:00:34,765 --> 01:00:36,366
The money--

1096
01:00:36,366 --> 01:00:38,302
for t.J.

1097
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:41,972
Oh, you know
about that, huh?

1098
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:43,974
Yeah...

1099
01:00:44,909 --> 01:00:47,177
I lost t.J.'S horse
gambling.

1100
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:51,982
Some things don't change.

1101
01:00:57,254 --> 01:00:58,288
I gotta go.

1102
01:01:02,693 --> 01:01:04,194
Hey, you know what?

1103
01:01:05,595 --> 01:01:07,331
You look pretty good
up there.

1104
01:01:07,331 --> 01:01:08,733
I couldn't figure out

1105
01:01:08,733 --> 01:01:10,134
what the hell
you were talking about,

1106
01:01:10,134 --> 01:01:12,136
between you and me,
but I...

1107
01:01:12,136 --> 01:01:15,205
You got it across
pretty good.

1108
01:01:17,207 --> 01:01:18,608
Billy. Uh...

1109
01:01:18,608 --> 01:01:20,344
You're
a big shot now.

1110
01:01:22,479 --> 01:01:23,948
Billy.

1111
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:27,351
Billy...

1112
01:01:28,418 --> 01:01:30,154
You know what?

1113
01:01:30,154 --> 01:01:32,322
There aren't
any big shots.

1114
01:01:33,557 --> 01:01:37,161
You know, you always did
have a head on your shoulders.

1115
01:01:37,161 --> 01:01:39,163
That's one of the things
I liked about you--

1116
01:01:39,163 --> 01:01:40,765
that you had a head
on your shoulders.

1117
01:01:40,765 --> 01:01:42,366
Ah...ohh...

1118
01:01:42,366 --> 01:01:44,301
Until I wanted
to use it.

1119
01:01:44,301 --> 01:01:46,636
Well, times change.
People change.

1120
01:01:46,636 --> 01:01:48,372
Ever hear of that?

1121
01:01:48,372 --> 01:01:50,374
In those days,

1122
01:01:50,374 --> 01:01:52,777
I wanted a woman...

1123
01:01:52,777 --> 01:01:55,780
To be around
when I needed her--

1124
01:01:55,780 --> 01:01:58,715
in a house waiting for me
when I come home.

1125
01:01:59,649 --> 01:02:02,152
Today...well, today...

1126
01:02:02,152 --> 01:02:05,756
I feel absolutely
the same way. Ha ha.

1127
01:02:07,357 --> 01:02:08,893
You're
something.

1128
01:02:08,893 --> 01:02:10,761
You're really
something.

1129
01:02:10,761 --> 01:02:13,363
Yeah, I am.
Well, I was only kidding.

1130
01:02:14,631 --> 01:02:16,100
But not much.

1131
01:02:18,635 --> 01:02:20,404
No, not much.

1132
01:02:31,782 --> 01:02:33,784
Hey, excuse me.
Barn 11?

1133
01:02:33,784 --> 01:02:35,385
Yes, sir, it is.

1134
01:02:35,385 --> 01:02:36,653
Is Billy around?

1135
01:02:36,653 --> 01:02:37,754
You mean
the champ?

1136
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:39,056
He's over there
working.

1137
01:02:39,056 --> 01:02:41,258
Billy!

1138
01:02:44,728 --> 01:02:46,530
How ya doin'?

1139
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,201
What's the matter,
you don't trust me?

1140
01:02:51,201 --> 01:02:54,004
I told you I'd bring
the money this afternoon.

1141
01:02:55,405 --> 01:02:56,807
What's this for?

1142
01:02:56,807 --> 01:02:58,142
What is this for?

1143
01:02:58,142 --> 01:02:59,576
Yeah.
What's that for?

1144
01:02:59,576 --> 01:03:02,146
For carrying a horse,
that's what that's for.

1145
01:03:02,146 --> 01:03:05,182
You think I drag around a horse
trailer for the hell of it?

1146
01:03:06,016 --> 01:03:07,885
That's very funny.

1147
01:03:07,885 --> 01:03:09,319
What horse?

1148
01:03:09,319 --> 01:03:10,720
Come on, Billy.

1149
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:13,323
You know what horse.

1150
01:03:15,159 --> 01:03:18,062
You were happy last night
when I told you I had the money.

1151
01:03:19,496 --> 01:03:20,898
Changed my mind.

1152
01:03:20,898 --> 01:03:23,200
I sorta like the idea
of owning a race horse.

1153
01:03:26,770 --> 01:03:28,505
Billy, Billy--hey!

1154
01:03:28,505 --> 01:03:29,773
Come on now.

1155
01:03:29,773 --> 01:03:31,341
We had a deal,
didn't we?

1156
01:03:31,341 --> 01:03:32,276
48 hours.

1157
01:03:32,276 --> 01:03:34,879
Deadline was up
10 hours ago, right?

1158
01:03:34,879 --> 01:03:37,781
It's only
a horse, bubbie.

1159
01:03:37,781 --> 01:03:39,416
Huh?

1160
01:03:39,416 --> 01:03:41,085
Ooh. Billy!

1161
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:23,393
No!

1162
01:04:23,393 --> 01:04:25,262
No!

1163
01:04:55,325 --> 01:04:56,961
Champ.

1164
01:05:10,774 --> 01:05:12,176
I've, uh...

1165
01:05:12,176 --> 01:05:14,178
Talked to most
of the witnesses,

1166
01:05:14,178 --> 01:05:16,180
gotten affidavits
from several of them.

1167
01:05:16,180 --> 01:05:18,182
They all seem to tell
the same story,

1168
01:05:18,182 --> 01:05:19,583
so there's, uh...

1169
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:22,386
Not much question
about what happened.

1170
01:05:22,386 --> 01:05:23,587
The, uh, judge

1171
01:05:23,587 --> 01:05:25,789
who's going to be
handling this hearing

1172
01:05:25,789 --> 01:05:27,191
is a friend of mine.

1173
01:05:27,191 --> 01:05:29,193
So the only real problem
we have, I think,

1174
01:05:29,193 --> 01:05:30,594
is the broken jaw

1175
01:05:30,594 --> 01:05:33,797
suffered by one
of the security guards.

1176
01:05:33,797 --> 01:05:36,000
Poor guy.

1177
01:05:37,801 --> 01:05:39,803
He's just trying
to do his job,

1178
01:05:39,803 --> 01:05:43,407
and I brain him
like a goddamn...

1179
01:05:43,407 --> 01:05:45,142
Animal.

1180
01:05:47,611 --> 01:05:50,814
Outside
of the immediate task

1181
01:05:50,814 --> 01:05:53,217
of getting you
out of jail,

1182
01:05:53,217 --> 01:05:55,819
Mrs. Phillips is very
worried about her son.

1183
01:05:55,819 --> 01:05:57,221
She asked me to tell you

1184
01:05:57,221 --> 01:05:59,756
that she would like
to take care of him

1185
01:05:59,756 --> 01:06:01,358
until this is settled.

1186
01:06:01,358 --> 01:06:02,492
Champ?

1187
01:06:09,633 --> 01:06:11,168
I...

1188
01:06:11,168 --> 01:06:14,171
Know how hard
this must be for you.

1189
01:06:14,171 --> 01:06:16,973
You don't know
nothin'.

1190
01:06:29,786 --> 01:06:31,321
Huh.

1191
01:06:46,203 --> 01:06:48,672
How--how you doing...

1192
01:06:48,672 --> 01:06:50,307
Champ?

1193
01:06:58,648 --> 01:07:00,517
Sit down.

1194
01:07:00,517 --> 01:07:02,786
I...

1195
01:07:02,786 --> 01:07:04,588
I thought
you might be hungry.

1196
01:07:04,588 --> 01:07:06,790
I brought you
something to eat.

1197
01:07:06,790 --> 01:07:08,692
I brought you
some ribs.

1198
01:07:12,196 --> 01:07:14,131
I ain't hungry.

1199
01:07:15,065 --> 01:07:16,600
Ok, champ.

1200
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:19,069
I don't want you
to call me champ no more.

1201
01:07:19,069 --> 01:07:21,105
Why?

1202
01:07:22,472 --> 01:07:26,110
A champ don't use his fist
nowhere but in the ring.

1203
01:07:26,110 --> 01:07:28,212
But he was trying to
take our horse, champ.

1204
01:07:28,212 --> 01:07:29,613
I know, I know,

1205
01:07:29,613 --> 01:07:31,681
but it don't make
no difference, t.J.

1206
01:07:31,681 --> 01:07:33,817
I had no right, see?

1207
01:07:33,817 --> 01:07:35,219
I'm a bum.

1208
01:07:35,219 --> 01:07:36,953
No, you're not.

1209
01:07:36,953 --> 01:07:39,489
D-did they say
when you could get out?

1210
01:07:39,489 --> 01:07:41,791
Did they say when
you could come home?

1211
01:07:42,826 --> 01:07:45,229
They don't know yet,
t.J.

1212
01:07:45,229 --> 01:07:46,830
Could be a month.

1213
01:07:48,698 --> 01:07:50,567
Could be 6 months.

1214
01:07:56,640 --> 01:08:00,076
Look, there's something
we gotta talk about.

1215
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:03,046
You know that lady...

1216
01:08:03,046 --> 01:08:04,448
The one at the boat?

1217
01:08:04,448 --> 01:08:06,049
The one you're going on

1218
01:08:06,049 --> 01:08:07,651
about how nice she is
all the time?

1219
01:08:07,651 --> 01:08:09,719
Annie?

1220
01:08:11,455 --> 01:08:13,590
Yeah, that's the one.
Annie.

1221
01:08:14,491 --> 01:08:16,360
Well, I want you
to do me a favor.

1222
01:08:20,063 --> 01:08:23,533
I want you to live
with her.

1223
01:08:34,411 --> 01:08:36,546
Why--why can't I stay
in the backstretch

1224
01:08:36,546 --> 01:08:37,614
with Josie?

1225
01:08:37,614 --> 01:08:39,616
Because I said so,
that's why.

1226
01:08:39,616 --> 01:08:42,619
I'm your father,
and that's the end of that.

1227
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:44,588
W-why do you want me
to do that?

1228
01:08:44,588 --> 01:08:45,822
Because...

1229
01:08:45,822 --> 01:08:47,624
Because you're a pain
in the ass, that's why.

1230
01:08:47,624 --> 01:08:49,626
Because I can't do nothin'
without...

1231
01:08:49,626 --> 01:08:52,162
Without you naggin' at me
all the time.

1232
01:08:52,162 --> 01:08:53,630
"Champ" this
and "champ" that.

1233
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:55,799
I go to have a drink,
you say, "no, champ, don't."

1234
01:08:55,799 --> 01:08:57,033
I go to play cards,

1235
01:08:57,033 --> 01:08:59,102
you say, "no, don't do that."
You tug at my belt.

1236
01:08:59,102 --> 01:09:00,604
I'm sick of you
tuggin' at me.

1237
01:09:00,604 --> 01:09:02,206
I'm sick of feedin' you.

1238
01:09:02,206 --> 01:09:03,607
I'm sick of takin' care
of you.

1239
01:09:03,607 --> 01:09:05,209
I'm sick
of your hangin' around.

1240
01:09:05,209 --> 01:09:07,544
Ooh! You're a pain
in the ass!

1241
01:09:18,955 --> 01:09:20,824
Please, champ...

1242
01:09:20,824 --> 01:09:22,226
I'll...

1243
01:09:22,226 --> 01:09:23,627
I'll do whatever you say.

1244
01:09:23,627 --> 01:09:25,829
I--i won't eat that much.

1245
01:09:27,364 --> 01:09:28,765
I won't--

1246
01:09:28,765 --> 01:09:30,700
I'll let you play cards
as much as you want,

1247
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:31,801
I promise!

1248
01:09:31,801 --> 01:09:33,637
No, no, no.
You're going. That's it.

1249
01:09:33,637 --> 01:09:35,239
Please, champ.
I'll...

1250
01:09:35,239 --> 01:09:37,241
All I want
is to be with you.

1251
01:09:37,241 --> 01:09:38,375
Please, champ.

1252
01:09:38,375 --> 01:09:40,710
I'll be somebody
when I grow up.

1253
01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:42,045
Somebody like you.

1254
01:09:42,045 --> 01:09:43,247
Don't talk like that.

1255
01:09:43,247 --> 01:09:44,781
Look, you're going.
That's it.

1256
01:09:44,781 --> 01:09:46,082
I want you to go.

1257
01:09:46,082 --> 01:09:48,051
I'll do whatever you say
as long as I'm with you.

1258
01:09:48,051 --> 01:09:49,653
I don't wanna talk no more.
I want you to go.

1259
01:09:49,653 --> 01:09:51,255
I want you to go
in the boat.

1260
01:09:51,255 --> 01:09:53,390
No, you don't.
You don't want me to go.

1261
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:55,124
You understand now?
I want you to go.

1262
01:09:55,124 --> 01:09:57,327
No, you're a liar!

1263
01:10:11,608 --> 01:10:13,243
Ok, champ.

1264
01:10:15,412 --> 01:10:17,347
Ok, go ahead.

1265
01:10:27,156 --> 01:10:29,225
Take him
to that boat.

1266
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:35,291
Dolly,
I have to talk to you.

1267
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:36,292
What's up?

1268
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:37,761
Timmy. He's here.

1269
01:11:37,761 --> 01:11:38,562
He's here?

1270
01:11:38,562 --> 01:11:39,963
Yes, he's here.

1271
01:11:39,963 --> 01:11:41,898
A lot sooner than
I expected him to be.

1272
01:11:41,898 --> 01:11:43,299
Well, good. Go to him.

1273
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:44,701
But the party, dol.
I...

1274
01:11:44,701 --> 01:11:46,570
Oh, that doesn't matter.
Will you stop it?

1275
01:11:46,570 --> 01:11:48,304
The kid must be starved.
Give him something to eat.

1276
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:50,173
All right. I'll try
to get there later.

1277
01:11:50,173 --> 01:11:51,408
Ok.

1278
01:12:02,519 --> 01:12:04,253
I brought you some food.

1279
01:12:04,253 --> 01:12:05,855
You must be hungry.

1280
01:12:07,123 --> 01:12:09,859
No. I'm not. Honest.

1281
01:12:12,128 --> 01:12:13,863
Have you eaten
today?

1282
01:12:13,863 --> 01:12:14,798
No.

1283
01:12:14,798 --> 01:12:17,601
Well, let me make you
a sandwich.

1284
01:12:19,536 --> 01:12:22,138
T.j., have you
ever been...

1285
01:12:22,138 --> 01:12:24,007
To New York?

1286
01:12:24,007 --> 01:12:25,008
No.

1287
01:12:26,009 --> 01:12:28,011
It's a really big city.

1288
01:12:28,011 --> 01:12:29,413
We could, uh...

1289
01:12:29,413 --> 01:12:31,881
Could fly there
tomorrow--

1290
01:12:31,881 --> 01:12:33,383
just for a week.

1291
01:12:33,383 --> 01:12:35,885
Before you know it,

1292
01:12:35,885 --> 01:12:37,286
Billy will be out,

1293
01:12:37,286 --> 01:12:38,688
and...

1294
01:12:38,688 --> 01:12:40,757
You'll be back here
with him.

1295
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:45,529
Thank you, Annie.

1296
01:12:53,002 --> 01:12:54,438
Here.

1297
01:12:54,438 --> 01:12:56,039
You'll eat it later.

1298
01:12:57,707 --> 01:13:00,744
How about
a glass of milk?

1299
01:13:00,744 --> 01:13:02,011
Ok.

1300
01:13:43,319 --> 01:13:45,188
You know,
you must be tired.

1301
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:48,925
It's time
you went to bed.

1302
01:13:53,730 --> 01:13:56,065
Come on.
I'll help you undress.

1303
01:13:56,065 --> 01:13:57,734
No, it's ok.

1304
01:13:57,734 --> 01:14:01,671
The day a man can't
take off his own pants,

1305
01:14:01,671 --> 01:14:04,474
he--he ain't a man.

1306
01:14:04,474 --> 01:14:06,676
Who told you that?

1307
01:14:08,011 --> 01:14:09,479
The champ?

1308
01:14:15,952 --> 01:14:19,288
Well, before you
take your pants off,

1309
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:21,525
you have to take
your shoes off.

1310
01:14:21,525 --> 01:14:23,760
Come. Sit here.

1311
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:26,696
Here let me...

1312
01:14:26,696 --> 01:14:29,499
Hup. I--i can do it.

1313
01:14:30,834 --> 01:14:32,235
I--i don't know why

1314
01:14:32,235 --> 01:14:35,505
these shoes keep on
gettin' knots in them.

1315
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:39,042
L-let your mother do--

1316
01:14:49,452 --> 01:14:51,921
Champ didn't tell you?

1317
01:14:53,189 --> 01:14:54,323
Tell...

1318
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:56,025
Tell me what?

1319
01:15:02,298 --> 01:15:04,768
I'm your mother.

1320
01:15:09,773 --> 01:15:11,307
No.

1321
01:15:11,307 --> 01:15:13,476
M-my mother's dead.

1322
01:15:13,476 --> 01:15:14,711
No, she's not.

1323
01:15:14,711 --> 01:15:16,580
She's a--
she's a beautiful angel.

1324
01:15:16,580 --> 01:15:17,847
No, she's not.

1325
01:15:17,847 --> 01:15:20,584
I am here,
and I love you.

1326
01:15:20,584 --> 01:15:21,851
I love you very much.

1327
01:15:21,851 --> 01:15:23,987
You don't live with us.

1328
01:15:23,987 --> 01:15:27,356
Y-you're not married
to champ.

1329
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:29,325
No, listen.

1330
01:15:29,325 --> 01:15:31,127
Listen to me, t.J.

1331
01:15:31,127 --> 01:15:33,930
You don't have to live
with someone to love them.

1332
01:15:33,930 --> 01:15:34,731
I love you.

1333
01:15:34,731 --> 01:15:36,532
Do you love the champ?

1334
01:15:37,333 --> 01:15:39,335
Do you?

1335
01:15:39,335 --> 01:15:41,070
Do you love him?

1336
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:46,676
No. You're not my mother.

1337
01:15:47,476 --> 01:15:49,478
No...

1338
01:15:49,478 --> 01:15:50,747
You're not my mother.

1339
01:15:50,747 --> 01:15:52,348
Ple--please! No, please.
Listen to me.

1340
01:15:52,348 --> 01:15:53,583
It's not that simple.

1341
01:15:53,583 --> 01:15:54,984
T.j., listen to me.

1342
01:15:54,984 --> 01:15:56,753
Go away.
Please don't touch me.

1343
01:15:56,753 --> 01:15:58,888
I don't want you.
I don't want you!

1344
01:15:58,888 --> 01:15:59,856
Timmy!

1345
01:15:59,856 --> 01:16:02,091
Go away. Go away.
Go away, I told you!

1346
01:16:02,091 --> 01:16:03,292
Go away!

1347
01:16:03,292 --> 01:16:04,327
Go away!

1348
01:16:04,327 --> 01:16:05,662
I want champ!

1349
01:16:05,662 --> 01:16:08,264
I don't want you.
I want the champ.

1350
01:16:08,264 --> 01:16:09,866
I want champ!

1351
01:16:09,866 --> 01:16:10,667
Champ!

1352
01:16:10,667 --> 01:16:12,335
I want champ!

1353
01:16:12,335 --> 01:16:13,737
I don't want you!

1354
01:16:13,737 --> 01:16:16,239
I wanna go back
to the champ!

1355
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:17,741
I want champ!
Get out of here!

1356
01:20:34,797 --> 01:20:36,933
You know
what you are?

1357
01:20:36,933 --> 01:20:38,334
A pain in the ass.

1358
01:20:38,334 --> 01:20:41,004
A pain in the ass.
Yeah, that's right.

1359
01:20:48,077 --> 01:20:50,079
Ah, I know one thing.

1360
01:20:50,079 --> 01:20:53,016
I ain't gonna
never leave you again.

1361
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:57,820
Oh, I love you so much.

1362
01:20:57,820 --> 01:20:59,889
I love you so much.

1363
01:21:06,262 --> 01:21:07,863
Yeah.

1364
01:21:30,653 --> 01:21:31,820
Yeah?

1365
01:21:31,820 --> 01:21:33,622
I didn't wake you,
did I, Billy?

1366
01:21:33,622 --> 01:21:35,824
There's a lady downstairs
that wants to see you.

1367
01:21:35,824 --> 01:21:38,027
Oh, thanks.
Thanks, Willie.

1368
01:22:18,201 --> 01:22:20,003
Didn't Josie tell you?

1369
01:22:21,204 --> 01:22:23,039
He's here. He's ok.

1370
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:25,574
She told me.

1371
01:22:30,346 --> 01:22:32,681
You're so lucky, Billy.

1372
01:22:34,217 --> 01:22:36,519
God, how he loves you.

1373
01:22:39,288 --> 01:22:40,556
Yeah.

1374
01:22:42,558 --> 01:22:44,027
So...

1375
01:22:49,565 --> 01:22:51,167
I, uh...

1376
01:22:52,668 --> 01:22:54,837
I--i wanted to,
uh...

1377
01:22:54,837 --> 01:22:56,439
Talk to you.

1378
01:22:56,439 --> 01:22:58,041
Well...

1379
01:22:58,841 --> 01:23:00,376
Here I am.

1380
01:23:03,779 --> 01:23:05,648
T.j...

1381
01:23:05,648 --> 01:23:07,183
Found out last night

1382
01:23:07,183 --> 01:23:09,985
that he has a mother.

1383
01:23:11,187 --> 01:23:14,123
He--he's gonna need
an explan--

1384
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:19,995
an explanation.

1385
01:23:22,665 --> 01:23:24,067
I'll take care of that.

1386
01:23:24,067 --> 01:23:26,001
Billy...

1387
01:23:27,203 --> 01:23:29,205
Will you tell him...

1388
01:23:29,205 --> 01:23:31,540
How it was...

1389
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:33,409
And how it is?

1390
01:23:34,410 --> 01:23:36,011
How is it?

1391
01:23:41,484 --> 01:23:43,819
I'm not an angel
in heaven.

1392
01:23:43,819 --> 01:23:45,421
Who says?

1393
01:23:49,825 --> 01:23:51,427
I'm not.

1394
01:23:53,229 --> 01:23:54,563
I'm real.

1395
01:23:54,563 --> 01:23:56,031
I'm here.

1396
01:23:57,233 --> 01:24:00,403
A woman
who suffers...

1397
01:24:01,670 --> 01:24:03,072
Who wants her child

1398
01:24:03,072 --> 01:24:06,675
to accept her
as a mother who...

1399
01:24:07,676 --> 01:24:10,079
Made a mistake.

1400
01:24:10,079 --> 01:24:12,148
Made a hell
of a mistake.

1401
01:24:12,948 --> 01:24:14,283
All right.

1402
01:24:15,084 --> 01:24:16,085
All right,

1403
01:24:16,085 --> 01:24:17,786
but he has
to understand why.

1404
01:24:17,786 --> 01:24:19,122
Has to understand

1405
01:24:19,122 --> 01:24:20,489
that 2 people just
couldn't live together--

1406
01:24:20,489 --> 01:24:22,225
hey, hold your horses.
2 people?

1407
01:24:22,225 --> 01:24:24,560
One person couldn't.
I could.

1408
01:24:25,694 --> 01:24:27,096
Oh, what? Billy...

1409
01:24:27,096 --> 01:24:28,631
There are a million
broken marriages.

1410
01:24:28,631 --> 01:24:30,233
It's never
because of one person!

1411
01:24:30,233 --> 01:24:31,767
The reason why
you have a broken marriage--

1412
01:24:31,767 --> 01:24:33,169
don't you remem--

1413
01:24:33,169 --> 01:24:35,171
one person doesn't care.
That's your broken marriage.

1414
01:24:35,171 --> 01:24:36,739
Don't tell me
I didn't care.

1415
01:24:36,739 --> 01:24:38,307
Then why did you leave?

1416
01:24:40,309 --> 01:24:42,245
Come on! Tell me.
Why?

1417
01:24:42,245 --> 01:24:45,314
Look, let's not talk
about what happened.

1418
01:24:45,314 --> 01:24:47,015
Well, what did happen?
I wanna know what happened.

1419
01:24:47,015 --> 01:24:48,317
What'd you do,

1420
01:24:48,317 --> 01:24:49,852
go to Paris and make dresses
for French girls?

1421
01:24:49,852 --> 01:24:51,154
What do I tell him?

1422
01:24:51,154 --> 01:24:52,655
That you wanted a career,

1423
01:24:52,655 --> 01:24:54,657
and that's why you left
your son and your husband?

1424
01:24:54,657 --> 01:24:56,859
Is that what
you want me to say?

1425
01:24:56,859 --> 01:24:58,394
Come on! Talk to me!

1426
01:24:58,394 --> 01:24:59,928
I'm right here.

1427
01:24:59,928 --> 01:25:01,330
I'll say anything
you want.

1428
01:25:01,330 --> 01:25:02,598
Come on.
Talk to me!

1429
01:25:02,598 --> 01:25:04,467
Billy, can't we just
sit down quietly

1430
01:25:04,467 --> 01:25:06,135
and discuss our son now?

1431
01:25:06,135 --> 01:25:07,603
Just forget about him.
Forget about him.

1432
01:25:07,603 --> 01:25:09,538
He's a very strong boy.
He can take care of himself.

1433
01:25:09,538 --> 01:25:11,039
I can't forget
about him.

1434
01:25:11,039 --> 01:25:12,808
I know he's strong,
but he's 8 years old.

1435
01:25:12,808 --> 01:25:14,210
Yeah.
8 years of my life.

1436
01:25:14,210 --> 01:25:15,611
But what's happening
to him now?

1437
01:25:15,611 --> 01:25:17,346
What's going on in him?
What's he thinking?

1438
01:25:17,346 --> 01:25:19,081
What's happening
in his heart, his mind?

1439
01:25:19,081 --> 01:25:20,483
What about my heart?

1440
01:25:20,483 --> 01:25:22,418
What about my mind?

1441
01:25:23,219 --> 01:25:25,188
What about me?

1442
01:25:25,188 --> 01:25:27,556
What about me?
Billy Flynn! Me, you know?

1443
01:25:27,556 --> 01:25:28,657
What about me?

1444
01:25:28,657 --> 01:25:30,159
I'm real, too.

1445
01:25:36,365 --> 01:25:39,168
What's the matter,
Billy?

1446
01:25:41,570 --> 01:25:43,239
What is it?

1447
01:25:54,850 --> 01:25:57,553
You can always come back.

1448
01:26:09,365 --> 01:26:11,099
We'll--we'll take you back.

1449
01:26:11,099 --> 01:26:14,303
You--we'll give you
a second chance.

1450
01:26:16,972 --> 01:26:18,574
Billy...

1451
01:26:19,575 --> 01:26:21,176
I can't.

1452
01:26:33,389 --> 01:26:35,591
I have a husband, Billy.

1453
01:27:19,835 --> 01:27:21,437
Billy...

1454
01:27:23,839 --> 01:27:25,841
You know, there are...

1455
01:27:27,376 --> 01:27:29,244
There are different ways

1456
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:30,979
of loving someone.

1457
01:27:34,983 --> 01:27:37,320
Can't we find our way?

1458
01:27:41,657 --> 01:27:43,992
For t.J.?

1459
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:46,995
For our son?

1460
01:27:48,030 --> 01:27:49,865
Come on, come on.

1461
01:27:49,865 --> 01:27:51,834
Don't do that.

1462
01:27:57,105 --> 01:27:59,608
I know what I gotta do.

1463
01:28:11,019 --> 01:28:13,822
I know what to do.
Don't worry about it.

1464
01:28:13,822 --> 01:28:15,424
I know what to do.

1465
01:28:26,369 --> 01:28:28,637
Ok, nothin' stands
in my way.

1466
01:28:28,637 --> 01:28:30,839
Who do we got?
All the way to the champ.

1467
01:28:30,839 --> 01:28:31,640
Andy pittman.

1468
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:33,642
Andy pittman?
You a boxer?

1469
01:28:33,642 --> 01:28:36,244
Ok, come on, Andy.
Come on. Think fast.

1470
01:28:36,244 --> 01:28:37,846
Come on. Whoa!
Watch the right.

1471
01:28:39,848 --> 01:28:40,849
Ok. Hold up.

1472
01:28:42,518 --> 01:28:44,853
Andy's down, Andy's down.
What do we do next?

1473
01:28:44,853 --> 01:28:45,854
Um...

1474
01:28:45,854 --> 01:28:46,855
Who do we got?

1475
01:28:46,855 --> 01:28:48,357
Roland bowers.

1476
01:28:48,357 --> 01:28:50,258
Roland bowers. Stay away
from the right hand.

1477
01:28:50,258 --> 01:28:51,660
But give him
a little jab, see?

1478
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:53,862
Then go across the top.
Inside. Inside.

1479
01:28:53,862 --> 01:28:55,263
Bang, bang, bang!

1480
01:28:55,263 --> 01:28:56,865
Roland is down.
He's down.

1481
01:28:56,865 --> 01:28:57,666
Bye-bye, Roland.

1482
01:28:57,666 --> 01:28:59,535
Bye-bye, Roland
is right.

1483
01:28:59,535 --> 01:29:00,703
Ok. Now we're on our way.

1484
01:29:00,703 --> 01:29:02,538
Championship of the world
in 6 months!

1485
01:29:02,538 --> 01:29:04,239
The championship
of the world

1486
01:29:04,239 --> 01:29:05,508
in just 6 months!

1487
01:29:05,508 --> 01:29:06,909
That's right.
Gonna buy a house.

1488
01:29:06,909 --> 01:29:08,511
Buy a house with
a swimming pool in it

1489
01:29:08,511 --> 01:29:09,812
right in the middle
of the house.

1490
01:29:09,812 --> 01:29:11,380
Then we're gonna
go traveling.

1491
01:29:11,380 --> 01:29:12,648
Me and my kid,
right?

1492
01:29:12,648 --> 01:29:14,149
All over the world.
Where we gonna go?

1493
01:29:14,149 --> 01:29:15,350
Brazil!

1494
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:16,652
Brazil! What are we gonna
see in Brazil?

1495
01:29:16,652 --> 01:29:18,153
I know what
we're gonna see.

1496
01:29:18,153 --> 01:29:21,256
A lot of seã‘oritas
dancing the cha-cha-cha.

1497
01:29:21,256 --> 01:29:22,257
Right?

1498
01:29:22,257 --> 01:29:23,258
Right.

1499
01:29:23,258 --> 01:29:24,259
* cha cha cha *

1500
01:29:24,259 --> 01:29:25,694
* cha cha cha *

1501
01:29:25,694 --> 01:29:27,696
come on. Let's see
what you're made of, kid.

1502
01:29:27,696 --> 01:29:29,665
Let's see
what you're made of, kid.

1503
01:29:29,665 --> 01:29:31,166
Whoa!
Oh, he hit me hard.

1504
01:29:32,468 --> 01:29:33,802
Don't let him do that
to you. Bing! Bing!

1505
01:29:33,802 --> 01:29:35,671
You think I'm hurt,
but I'm not hurt.

1506
01:29:35,671 --> 01:29:37,272
I'm coming back, see?
Bing! Bing!

1507
01:29:37,272 --> 01:29:38,273
Oh. Watch it.

1508
01:29:38,273 --> 01:29:39,675
They'll throw you out.

1509
01:29:39,675 --> 01:29:41,176
You know, the rules
are against you.

1510
01:29:41,176 --> 01:29:42,277
Watch out. Come on.

1511
01:29:42,277 --> 01:29:43,412
Come on. Come on.
Let's see--

1512
01:29:43,412 --> 01:29:44,513
oh! Good shot.

1513
01:29:44,513 --> 01:29:46,682
Come on.
Get back on your horse.

1514
01:29:46,682 --> 01:29:48,283
We got a lot of work.
Lot of work.

1515
01:29:48,283 --> 01:29:49,885
Get your old man
in shape.

1516
01:29:49,885 --> 01:29:51,286
37-year-old legs.

1517
01:29:51,286 --> 01:29:52,688
Come on. Come on.

1518
01:29:52,688 --> 01:29:54,890
Come on. Let's go.

1519
01:29:54,890 --> 01:29:56,692
Let's go.

1520
01:29:56,692 --> 01:29:58,293
Get 'em, champ.

1521
01:29:58,293 --> 01:29:59,895
Gotta breathe.

1522
01:29:59,895 --> 01:30:01,296
Gotta breathe.

1523
01:30:02,297 --> 01:30:04,166
All right. Come on.

1524
01:30:33,729 --> 01:30:36,331
Sure, I'm hurt.

1525
01:30:36,331 --> 01:30:38,934
What the hell
does that matter?

1526
01:30:39,735 --> 01:30:41,336
You're gonna
fight again,

1527
01:30:41,336 --> 01:30:42,938
and you don't
call me?

1528
01:30:45,340 --> 01:30:46,742
I was gonna call you,

1529
01:30:46,742 --> 01:30:48,343
but I didn't want
to waste your time.

1530
01:30:48,343 --> 01:30:49,344
Bullshit.

1531
01:30:49,344 --> 01:30:50,345
The fight
ain't set yet.

1532
01:30:50,345 --> 01:30:51,346
Bullshit.

1533
01:30:51,346 --> 01:30:52,347
Jackie...

1534
01:30:52,347 --> 01:30:53,816
You don't call me

1535
01:30:53,816 --> 01:30:55,751
because you know Jackie's
gonna give you a problem.

1536
01:30:55,751 --> 01:30:57,352
What are
you talking about?

1537
01:30:57,352 --> 01:30:58,353
Look, Billy,

1538
01:30:58,353 --> 01:30:59,688
this is Jackie
sitting here.

1539
01:30:59,688 --> 01:31:02,825
What, you think
I don't know?

1540
01:31:02,825 --> 01:31:05,393
You took too many goddamn
punches in the last fight!

1541
01:31:05,393 --> 01:31:06,695
Hey. Punches
don't bother me.

1542
01:31:06,695 --> 01:31:08,597
Yeah, well,
they bother me.

1543
01:31:10,098 --> 01:31:12,167
What about the headaches?
You still get 'em?

1544
01:31:12,167 --> 01:31:14,036
Headaches?

1545
01:31:15,303 --> 01:31:17,706
Everybody gets headaches,
Jackie.

1546
01:31:17,706 --> 01:31:19,107
You get headaches,
don't you?

1547
01:31:19,107 --> 01:31:22,177
Take a few aspirin.
That's it. You know.

1548
01:31:22,177 --> 01:31:23,512
Huh?

1549
01:31:24,179 --> 01:31:25,514
Come on, now, Billy.

1550
01:31:25,514 --> 01:31:27,983
Look, I not talkin' about
a split lip or a busted nose.

1551
01:31:27,983 --> 01:31:30,919
I'm talkin' about something
that could be serious.

1552
01:31:32,154 --> 01:31:33,722
Let's, uh...

1553
01:31:33,722 --> 01:31:36,959
Let's let the medical
examiner decide, huh?

1554
01:31:36,959 --> 01:31:40,328
I'm taking this fight,
Jackie, for me and my boy,

1555
01:31:40,328 --> 01:31:41,997
and nothing's
gonna stop me.

1556
01:31:41,997 --> 01:31:44,533
With or without you,
I've made up my mind.

1557
01:31:48,904 --> 01:31:50,939
Look...

1558
01:31:52,007 --> 01:31:54,677
I gotta do something
for my boy.

1559
01:31:57,613 --> 01:31:59,081
A home.

1560
01:32:00,415 --> 01:32:01,850
A good school, you know?

1561
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:04,186
I can't make that kind
of money walkin' horses.

1562
01:32:10,325 --> 01:32:12,060
I need you, Jackie.

1563
01:32:16,064 --> 01:32:18,667
I need you with me.

1564
01:32:34,082 --> 01:32:35,951
Ok.

1565
01:33:42,951 --> 01:33:44,152
Beautiful,
beautiful!

1566
01:33:44,152 --> 01:33:45,553
Ha ha ha!

1567
01:33:45,553 --> 01:33:47,022
I love you, Jackie!

1568
01:33:49,357 --> 01:33:50,759
Hey, t.J.

1569
01:33:50,759 --> 01:33:52,160
Yeah, champ?

1570
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:54,229
You got anything
you wanna tell me?

1571
01:33:55,363 --> 01:33:56,564
No, champ.

1572
01:33:56,564 --> 01:33:59,367
Why do you keep secrets
from me, t.J.?

1573
01:33:59,367 --> 01:34:02,237
I haven't been keeping
secrets from you.

1574
01:34:02,237 --> 01:34:04,306
Oh, yeah. What about
Annie's letters?

1575
01:34:04,306 --> 01:34:05,708
What about that, huh?

1576
01:34:05,708 --> 01:34:08,310
Uh, I'm sorry,
champ.

1577
01:34:08,310 --> 01:34:10,312
Uh, are you mad?

1578
01:34:10,312 --> 01:34:12,715
No, I ain't mad.

1579
01:34:12,715 --> 01:34:14,717
I just like to know
what's under my bed,

1580
01:34:14,717 --> 01:34:15,718
that's all.

1581
01:34:15,718 --> 01:34:17,720
Huh. I ain't mad.

1582
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:20,455
She can write ya
if she wants to.

1583
01:34:20,455 --> 01:34:21,924
Come on. Let's go.

1584
01:34:27,730 --> 01:34:29,932
T.j.
T.j., come here.

1585
01:34:31,867 --> 01:34:33,936
Come here.
Come here, come here.

1586
01:34:34,737 --> 01:34:36,004
Look at that, will ya?

1587
01:34:36,004 --> 01:34:37,873
They got the right idea.

1588
01:34:37,873 --> 01:34:40,642
Come on,
let's go for a swim.

1589
01:34:40,642 --> 01:34:42,077
Come on.

1590
01:34:42,077 --> 01:34:43,611
Come on.

1591
01:34:43,611 --> 01:34:45,347
Last one in
is a rotten egg.

1592
01:34:49,752 --> 01:34:51,820
Did you write her back?

1593
01:34:56,358 --> 01:34:57,960
Not yet.

1594
01:35:00,195 --> 01:35:01,529
Well...

1595
01:35:01,529 --> 01:35:03,732
There's nothin' wrong
with that, either, you know?

1596
01:35:03,732 --> 01:35:05,968
Writin' to your mother.

1597
01:35:07,135 --> 01:35:09,604
I--I'll write her tonight.

1598
01:35:09,604 --> 01:35:11,206
Good.

1599
01:35:12,340 --> 01:35:14,743
Last one in is a rot--

1600
01:35:14,743 --> 01:35:16,144
get your pants on!

1601
01:35:16,144 --> 01:35:18,146
We're gonna be arrested
for nude bathing.

1602
01:35:18,146 --> 01:35:19,447
To hell with you.
I'm going.

1603
01:35:21,349 --> 01:35:22,350
Wait for me!

1604
01:35:22,350 --> 01:35:23,752
Come on.
Come on now.

1605
01:35:23,752 --> 01:35:25,353
You're gonna be
a rotten egg.

1606
01:35:25,353 --> 01:35:26,354
Come on.

1607
01:35:26,354 --> 01:35:27,756
Come on.
Come on, son.

1608
01:35:27,756 --> 01:35:28,757
All right.

1609
01:35:37,232 --> 01:35:38,767
Whoo!

1610
01:35:38,767 --> 01:35:40,168
Right this way.

1611
01:35:40,168 --> 01:35:41,770
What, are you afraid
of a little water?

1612
01:35:41,770 --> 01:35:43,105
Aah!

1613
01:35:48,911 --> 01:35:50,378
There you go.

1614
01:35:56,684 --> 01:35:58,787
Oh, look at this one
coming.

1615
01:35:58,787 --> 01:35:59,822
Aah!

1616
01:35:59,822 --> 01:36:01,423
Oh! Hey, hey!

1617
01:36:01,423 --> 01:36:02,424
Hey!

1618
01:36:02,424 --> 01:36:03,691
Champ. Yeah?

1619
01:36:03,691 --> 01:36:05,727
Did you love her?

1620
01:36:05,727 --> 01:36:06,728
Who?

1621
01:36:06,728 --> 01:36:07,996
Annie.

1622
01:36:07,996 --> 01:36:09,731
'Course I loved her!

1623
01:36:09,731 --> 01:36:11,733
Why do you think
we had you, huh?

1624
01:36:13,668 --> 01:36:14,736
Aah!

1625
01:36:14,736 --> 01:36:16,939
Hold on. Here we go.
Here we go.

1626
01:36:20,508 --> 01:36:21,509
Hey.

1627
01:36:33,721 --> 01:36:36,158
...cab driver
took a wrong turn.

1628
01:36:36,158 --> 01:36:37,759
Like a fool,
I gave him a dollar tip,

1629
01:36:37,759 --> 01:36:39,761
and he acted
as if I had stiffed him.

1630
01:36:39,761 --> 01:36:41,163
Mmm.

1631
01:36:41,163 --> 01:36:43,265
Are you with me
or what?

1632
01:36:43,265 --> 01:36:44,099
Oh.

1633
01:36:44,099 --> 01:36:47,302
Yes, I'm--I'm with you.

1634
01:36:47,302 --> 01:36:48,503
I...

1635
01:36:49,637 --> 01:36:53,508
I--i received my first letter
from my son today.

1636
01:36:53,508 --> 01:36:54,509
From t.J.

1637
01:36:54,509 --> 01:36:55,710
Great.

1638
01:36:55,710 --> 01:36:58,513
Do you know
how he signed it?

1639
01:36:58,513 --> 01:37:00,482
"Your friend forever,

1640
01:37:00,482 --> 01:37:02,750
Timothy Joseph Flynn."

1641
01:37:02,750 --> 01:37:04,486
Ha ha. How is he?

1642
01:37:04,486 --> 01:37:05,888
Oh, t.J.'S fine.

1643
01:37:05,888 --> 01:37:08,356
He seems fine.

1644
01:37:10,625 --> 01:37:12,027
It's, uh,
it's Billy.

1645
01:37:12,027 --> 01:37:13,361
What about him?

1646
01:37:15,163 --> 01:37:18,100
Billy's making
a comeback.

1647
01:37:19,167 --> 01:37:21,236
Every fighter dreams
of a comeback, huh?

1648
01:37:21,236 --> 01:37:22,704
Yes, but...

1649
01:37:22,704 --> 01:37:25,974
Take me out of the picture,
and what have you got?

1650
01:37:27,509 --> 01:37:29,177
Walking horses.

1651
01:37:30,545 --> 01:37:34,582
No, I don't think that Billy
would go back into the ring...

1652
01:37:34,582 --> 01:37:38,353
If I hadn't come back
into their lives.

1653
01:37:38,353 --> 01:37:41,389
You sure you're not
overreacting just a bit?

1654
01:37:43,926 --> 01:37:45,127
Maybe.

1655
01:37:46,962 --> 01:37:48,663
Mike...

1656
01:37:48,663 --> 01:37:49,664
I'm worried.

1657
01:37:49,664 --> 01:37:51,666
I'm worried about Billy.

1658
01:37:51,666 --> 01:37:53,068
At any rate,

1659
01:37:53,068 --> 01:37:55,003
I'm going to the fight.

1660
01:38:00,342 --> 01:38:01,509
When is it?

1661
01:38:01,509 --> 01:38:04,212
This Thursday in Miami.

1662
01:38:06,548 --> 01:38:09,151
Mike, you do understand,
don't you?

1663
01:38:09,151 --> 01:38:12,154
Well, to be totally honest,
I'm not sure I do.

1664
01:38:12,154 --> 01:38:15,623
I mean, I'm delighted that
t.J. Is back in your life,

1665
01:38:15,623 --> 01:38:17,425
but the rest, all this,

1666
01:38:17,425 --> 01:38:19,894
I'm not sure
I like it at all.

1667
01:38:22,364 --> 01:38:25,367
Well, maybe I can
explain it to you.

1668
01:38:25,367 --> 01:38:28,370
T.j. Didn't exactly
say so in the letter,

1669
01:38:28,370 --> 01:38:30,172
but I think...

1670
01:38:30,172 --> 01:38:33,375
I think he'd like me
to be there,

1671
01:38:33,375 --> 01:38:34,977
and...

1672
01:38:35,843 --> 01:38:37,779
Mike, what's
more important

1673
01:38:37,779 --> 01:38:39,982
is that I think
I should be there.

1674
01:38:43,451 --> 01:38:45,653
Would you prefer
I lied to you?

1675
01:38:55,797 --> 01:38:57,199
Will you call me

1676
01:38:57,199 --> 01:38:59,401
if you decide to stay
and walk horses?

1677
01:39:11,013 --> 01:39:12,614
How's it feel, Billy?

1678
01:39:17,752 --> 01:39:19,254
Feels good.

1679
01:39:29,531 --> 01:39:31,466
How's that?

1680
01:39:31,466 --> 01:39:33,101
Good.

1681
01:39:35,503 --> 01:39:36,438
Ok, you guys.

1682
01:39:36,438 --> 01:39:38,373
3 more rounds.
Let's get ready.

1683
01:40:39,301 --> 01:40:40,568
Hey.

1684
01:40:40,568 --> 01:40:42,104
Close the door, huh?

1685
01:41:19,107 --> 01:41:21,075
Come on, champ.
Punch him!

1686
01:42:09,457 --> 01:42:11,025
Atta way.
That's the way.

1687
01:42:11,025 --> 01:42:13,328
You're lookin' good.
You're lookin' beautiful.

1688
01:42:13,328 --> 01:42:14,929
Let him
chase you around.

1689
01:42:14,929 --> 01:42:16,264
Just keep
your left hand

1690
01:42:16,264 --> 01:42:17,632
right in his face
all the time.

1691
01:42:17,632 --> 01:42:19,100
You're lookin'
beautiful.

1692
01:42:19,100 --> 01:42:20,101
Beautiful.

1693
01:42:20,101 --> 01:42:21,403
Now just
hang in there.

1694
01:42:27,842 --> 01:42:28,976
You could do
a lot more.

1695
01:42:28,976 --> 01:42:29,977
Just don't
do it.

1696
01:42:29,977 --> 01:42:30,978
Don't
do it.

1697
01:42:30,978 --> 01:42:32,046
Champ, she's here.

1698
01:42:32,046 --> 01:42:33,381
Who?

1699
01:42:33,381 --> 01:42:35,417
Annie's here, champ.
Look at her. Over there.

1700
01:42:37,619 --> 01:42:40,588
Come on, Billy.
Time to fight.

1701
01:42:40,588 --> 01:42:41,856
What the hell
are you doing?

1702
01:42:41,856 --> 01:42:42,857
Come on!

1703
01:42:42,857 --> 01:42:44,592
Don't she look beautiful?

1704
01:42:47,195 --> 01:42:49,197
He'll run out of gas.

1705
01:42:49,197 --> 01:42:50,265
Hit him with a good
left, then right.

1706
01:42:50,265 --> 01:42:51,766
Supposed to be an old man.

1707
01:42:51,766 --> 01:42:52,567
Forget about it.

1708
01:42:52,567 --> 01:42:54,035
You got 13 years
on this kid.

1709
01:42:54,035 --> 01:42:56,671
This is my night, Jackie.
I can't do nothing wrong.

1710
01:42:56,671 --> 01:42:58,373
I can't do nothing wrong.

1711
01:43:39,681 --> 01:43:42,617
All right!
Come on, Billy!

1712
01:43:42,617 --> 01:43:43,885
Come on!

1713
01:44:07,208 --> 01:44:08,943
Get up!

1714
01:44:08,943 --> 01:44:10,912
Get up!
Get up!

1715
01:44:10,912 --> 01:44:12,347
Stay down!

1716
01:44:13,548 --> 01:44:14,982
You're an old man!

1717
01:44:14,982 --> 01:44:16,418
You're an old man!

1718
01:44:19,887 --> 01:44:21,423
Come here, old man!

1719
01:44:44,211 --> 01:44:46,080
Like I keep telling you
all the time,

1720
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:48,282
you're taking a lot
of punches for nothin'.

1721
01:44:48,282 --> 01:44:49,684
This kid's legs
are starting to go.

1722
01:44:49,684 --> 01:44:51,353
All I want you to do
is stick and move.

1723
01:44:51,353 --> 01:44:53,488
I knocked him down.
You see that?

1724
01:44:53,488 --> 01:44:54,756
Yeah. Of course.

1725
01:44:54,756 --> 01:44:56,591
Then he got right up.
He's very strong.

1726
01:44:56,591 --> 01:44:58,259
You paying attention to
what I'm saying to you?

1727
01:44:58,259 --> 01:44:59,627
I got it,
for Christ's sake.

1728
01:44:59,627 --> 01:45:01,195
I know youse is tough,
but he's a good banger.

1729
01:45:01,195 --> 01:45:02,497
He's got no legs left.

1730
01:45:02,497 --> 01:45:03,998
Just keep movin',
movin', movin'.

1731
01:45:03,998 --> 01:45:05,166
I feel great.

1732
01:45:05,166 --> 01:45:06,368
I feel great,
kid.

1733
01:45:06,368 --> 01:45:07,769
Billy,
he's still strong.

1734
01:45:07,769 --> 01:45:09,637
Stay away
from that hand.

1735
01:45:09,637 --> 01:45:11,038
Stay on your toes.
Stay off the ropes.

1736
01:45:11,038 --> 01:45:12,640
Go back. He'll be
playin' our fight.

1737
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:14,342
We got it. You'll win,
I'm tellin' ya.

1738
01:45:37,599 --> 01:45:40,334
Break. Break. Get back.

1739
01:45:51,112 --> 01:45:52,514
Ok.

1740
01:46:03,958 --> 01:46:05,560
Hit back! Stick him,
stick him, stick him!

1741
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:06,961
Come on, champ!
Come on!

1742
01:46:45,567 --> 01:46:47,201
Ah. It's only your head.

1743
01:46:47,201 --> 01:46:49,571
Now will you listen to me?
Stay away from him.

1744
01:46:49,571 --> 01:46:50,705
He's strong.

1745
01:46:50,705 --> 01:46:52,306
I know he's strong,
god damn it!

1746
01:46:52,306 --> 01:46:54,175
Now don't try
to muscle him!

1747
01:46:55,309 --> 01:46:56,978
That's a goddamn
tough old man.

1748
01:46:56,978 --> 01:46:58,546
He's a strong guy,
Jackie.

1749
01:46:58,546 --> 01:46:59,547
He's a strong boy.

1750
01:46:59,547 --> 01:47:00,815
Watch out.

1751
01:47:00,815 --> 01:47:02,617
Another round,
you'll knock the guy out.

1752
01:47:02,617 --> 01:47:03,685
Just keep on movin'.

1753
01:47:03,685 --> 01:47:05,887
Keep after that eye,
understand?

1754
01:47:05,887 --> 01:47:06,688
Ok, kid?

1755
01:47:06,688 --> 01:47:08,456
It's ok, Billy.

1756
01:47:55,436 --> 01:47:57,104
5...

1757
01:47:57,104 --> 01:47:58,105
6...

1758
01:47:58,105 --> 01:47:59,807
Champ!

1759
01:47:59,807 --> 01:48:01,142
8...

1760
01:48:02,143 --> 01:48:04,746
Hold. 5.

1761
01:48:15,322 --> 01:48:16,891
Here, champ!

1762
01:48:16,891 --> 01:48:20,662
No, don't, son.
Don't stop the fight.

1763
01:48:22,964 --> 01:48:26,500
Let me look at it,
for Christ's sake.

1764
01:48:30,104 --> 01:48:32,073
Champ.

1765
01:48:52,827 --> 01:48:54,662
Champ!

1766
01:49:06,808 --> 01:49:08,209
That's it. That's it!

1767
01:49:20,888 --> 01:49:22,089
4...

1768
01:49:22,089 --> 01:49:23,290
5...

1769
01:49:24,291 --> 01:49:25,292
6...

1770
01:49:25,292 --> 01:49:26,293
7...

1771
01:49:26,293 --> 01:49:27,294
8...

1772
01:49:27,294 --> 01:49:28,295
9...

1773
01:49:41,108 --> 01:49:43,177
It's all right,
Jackie. I'm all right.

1774
01:49:45,713 --> 01:49:47,514
Doc,
look at him.

1775
01:49:47,514 --> 01:49:48,515
There.

1776
01:49:48,515 --> 01:49:49,684
He looks bad.

1777
01:49:49,684 --> 01:49:51,786
I'm gonna have to stop it,
Jackie.

1778
01:49:51,786 --> 01:49:53,721
No. Don't do that. No.

1779
01:49:53,721 --> 01:49:55,289
Please, champ.
Stop.

1780
01:49:55,289 --> 01:49:56,758
What day is it,
Billy?

1781
01:49:56,758 --> 01:49:58,726
It's Thursday.

1782
01:49:58,726 --> 01:50:00,928
Thursday...

1783
01:50:01,729 --> 01:50:03,330
May 23rd...

1784
01:50:03,330 --> 01:50:04,732
Wrong, Billy.

1785
01:50:04,732 --> 01:50:06,768
Miami.
The forum.

1786
01:50:07,568 --> 01:50:09,136
Well, ok.

1787
01:50:09,136 --> 01:50:10,738
I'll give him
another round,

1788
01:50:10,738 --> 01:50:12,139
but if that cut
gets any worse,

1789
01:50:12,139 --> 01:50:13,741
I'm gonna have
to stop it,

1790
01:50:13,741 --> 01:50:15,109
understand?

1791
01:50:16,343 --> 01:50:18,345
Billy...

1792
01:50:18,345 --> 01:50:20,347
Billy, please...

1793
01:50:20,347 --> 01:50:21,482
Listen to me.

1794
01:50:21,482 --> 01:50:22,884
Let me stop it.

1795
01:50:25,753 --> 01:50:27,354
I got him, Jackie.

1796
01:50:28,489 --> 01:50:30,491
I got him now.

1797
01:50:30,491 --> 01:50:33,394
Great fight.
I love it.

1798
01:50:33,394 --> 01:50:35,329
You got him
all busted out.

1799
01:50:35,329 --> 01:50:36,163
Yeah.

1800
01:50:36,163 --> 01:50:37,765
Hit him hard,
you understand?

1801
01:50:37,765 --> 01:50:39,967
Yeah.
Yeah, I got it.

1802
01:50:39,967 --> 01:50:41,769
I'm not gonna let him
butcher you.

1803
01:50:41,769 --> 01:50:43,971
I'm not gonna let him
butcher you.

1804
01:50:45,773 --> 01:50:47,975
What are you waiting for?

1805
01:51:17,338 --> 01:51:18,339
No!

1806
01:51:18,339 --> 01:51:19,506
No, stop!

1807
01:51:19,506 --> 01:51:20,742
No!

1808
01:52:05,352 --> 01:52:07,021
Ladies and gentlemen!

1809
01:52:07,021 --> 01:52:09,623
You're the greatest!
The greatest!

1810
01:52:09,623 --> 01:52:12,960
43 seconds
into round number 6,

1811
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:15,897
the winner by a knockout,

1812
01:52:15,897 --> 01:52:18,833
the former champion
of the world,

1813
01:52:18,833 --> 01:52:21,368
Billy Flynn!

1814
01:52:24,338 --> 01:52:26,941
Fantastic, Billy,
fantastic!

1815
01:52:26,941 --> 01:52:29,476
Beautiful!
Beautiful!

1816
01:52:31,345 --> 01:52:33,014
He's the champ!

1817
01:52:43,424 --> 01:52:45,159
Champ!

1818
01:52:48,796 --> 01:52:50,832
You're fantastic!
Fantastic!

1819
01:52:50,832 --> 01:52:52,399
Champ!

1820
01:53:12,519 --> 01:53:14,121
Keep them back.

1821
01:53:26,200 --> 01:53:28,069
Yeah, yeah.

1822
01:53:32,206 --> 01:53:34,008
Billy.

1823
01:53:34,008 --> 01:53:35,709
Billy, you all right?

1824
01:53:35,709 --> 01:53:37,611
Billy.
Billy.

1825
01:53:37,611 --> 01:53:38,980
All right, get a doctor.

1826
01:53:38,980 --> 01:53:41,448
Get a goddamn doctor!

1827
01:53:41,448 --> 01:53:42,449
Hesh.

1828
01:53:42,449 --> 01:53:43,584
Champ?

1829
01:53:43,584 --> 01:53:45,152
Take the mouthpiece out,
for Christ's sake.

1830
01:53:45,152 --> 01:53:46,553
I'm sorry.
I couldn't get near him.

1831
01:53:46,553 --> 01:53:48,355
I got to...

1832
01:53:48,355 --> 01:53:49,256
Get a doctor!

1833
01:53:49,256 --> 01:53:51,926
I got to collect
some bets, Jackie.

1834
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:54,896
I got to collect
some bets.

1835
01:53:54,896 --> 01:53:56,263
It's all right, Billy.

1836
01:53:56,263 --> 01:53:57,698
Don't worry. You're going
to be all right.

1837
01:53:57,698 --> 01:53:58,765
I'm not worried
about it.

1838
01:53:58,765 --> 01:54:01,168
It's only a fight, Jackie.

1839
01:54:01,168 --> 01:54:03,070
Come on,
get out of here.

1840
01:54:03,637 --> 01:54:05,606
Jack--

1841
01:54:05,606 --> 01:54:06,908
get the doctor,
will you?

1842
01:54:06,908 --> 01:54:08,142
For Christ's sake,
don't stand there.

1843
01:54:08,142 --> 01:54:10,277
Jackie, I got to collect
the bets, Jackie.

1844
01:54:10,277 --> 01:54:11,778
Wait until
the doctor gets here.

1845
01:54:11,778 --> 01:54:13,580
I got to collect the bets.

1846
01:54:13,580 --> 01:54:14,615
Don't worry
about it.

1847
01:54:14,615 --> 01:54:15,749
I got a list

1848
01:54:15,749 --> 01:54:16,817
of all the people
I made bets with.

1849
01:54:16,817 --> 01:54:17,885
It's in my pocket.

1850
01:54:17,885 --> 01:54:19,020
Billy, I'll
take care of it.

1851
01:54:19,020 --> 01:54:20,154
Now, don't worry
about it now.

1852
01:54:20,154 --> 01:54:21,855
I'll take care of it.
I promise.

1853
01:54:21,855 --> 01:54:23,790
Ok. Ok.

1854
01:54:23,790 --> 01:54:25,426
Ok, Jackie.

1855
01:54:25,426 --> 01:54:26,593
Where's my boy?

1856
01:54:26,593 --> 01:54:27,594
Here we go.

1857
01:54:27,594 --> 01:54:28,629
Where's my boy, Jackie?

1858
01:54:28,629 --> 01:54:30,664
Where's my boy?

1859
01:54:30,664 --> 01:54:32,799
He's right here.

1860
01:54:32,799 --> 01:54:34,635
Here he is.

1861
01:54:34,635 --> 01:54:35,869
T.j.?

1862
01:54:37,804 --> 01:54:39,073
T.j., where are you?

1863
01:54:40,307 --> 01:54:41,909
Here I am.

1864
01:54:42,809 --> 01:54:44,145
Yeah.

1865
01:54:50,284 --> 01:54:51,452
T.j.?

1866
01:54:53,887 --> 01:54:56,490
Annie was here
tonight, t.J.

1867
01:54:57,624 --> 01:54:59,360
Wasn't that a nice thing?

1868
01:55:01,662 --> 01:55:02,964
Yeah.

1869
01:55:02,964 --> 01:55:05,566
You invited her,
didn't you?

1870
01:55:06,633 --> 01:55:08,435
Huh?

1871
01:55:08,435 --> 01:55:09,636
I wrote to her.

1872
01:55:09,636 --> 01:55:12,573
You--you said to.

1873
01:55:13,674 --> 01:55:15,242
Yeah.

1874
01:55:15,242 --> 01:55:18,579
Well, it was
nice of her to come.

1875
01:55:20,314 --> 01:55:21,848
You know...

1876
01:55:21,848 --> 01:55:23,450
T.j...

1877
01:55:23,450 --> 01:55:25,086
You know...

1878
01:55:28,489 --> 01:55:30,591
Annie and me,

1879
01:55:30,591 --> 01:55:32,593
we did some...

1880
01:55:32,593 --> 01:55:34,195
Silly things.

1881
01:55:35,129 --> 01:55:37,999
Who knows why people
do what they do?

1882
01:55:37,999 --> 01:55:40,501
Nobody knows that.

1883
01:55:40,501 --> 01:55:41,868
But she was...

1884
01:55:41,868 --> 01:55:43,404
She was a good person.

1885
01:55:45,006 --> 01:55:46,873
You know that.

1886
01:55:46,873 --> 01:55:48,475
Champ.

1887
01:55:48,475 --> 01:55:50,144
You happy, kid?

1888
01:55:50,944 --> 01:55:53,147
I won the fight.

1889
01:55:54,148 --> 01:55:55,949
Are you happy?

1890
01:55:57,451 --> 01:55:59,786
Y-yeah.

1891
01:55:59,786 --> 01:56:00,754
Yeah.

1892
01:56:00,754 --> 01:56:02,023
The...

1893
01:56:03,357 --> 01:56:04,758
The champ...

1894
01:56:04,758 --> 01:56:05,759
Yeah.

1895
01:56:05,759 --> 01:56:07,394
Always comes through...

1896
01:56:09,663 --> 01:56:11,365
In the end.

1897
01:56:12,866 --> 01:56:14,868
That's right.

1898
01:56:16,637 --> 01:56:18,305
That's right.

1899
01:56:18,305 --> 01:56:19,506
Right.

1900
01:57:07,020 --> 01:57:08,622
I'm sorry.

1901
01:57:25,339 --> 01:57:28,442
No.

1902
01:57:29,910 --> 01:57:31,445
Champ.

1903
01:57:39,520 --> 01:57:40,687
Champ.

1904
01:57:41,988 --> 01:57:43,190
Champ.

1905
01:57:44,057 --> 01:57:45,692
Oh, champ.

1906
01:57:46,927 --> 01:57:50,131
Oh, why did this happen,
champ?

1907
01:57:54,935 --> 01:57:56,537
Champ, wake up.

1908
01:57:58,905 --> 01:58:00,474
Wake up!

1909
01:58:06,079 --> 01:58:07,681
Wake up!

1910
01:58:10,817 --> 01:58:11,818
Champ.

1911
01:58:11,818 --> 01:58:13,187
Wake up, champ.

1912
01:58:13,187 --> 01:58:14,921
Don't sleep now.

1913
01:58:14,921 --> 01:58:16,290
You got to go home.

1914
01:58:16,290 --> 01:58:18,359
Got to go home, champ.

1915
01:58:23,197 --> 01:58:24,565
Georgie!

1916
01:58:25,632 --> 01:58:27,234
Don't cry.

1917
01:58:28,034 --> 01:58:29,403
Georgie.

1918
01:58:30,604 --> 01:58:32,273
Mister, help him.

1919
01:58:32,273 --> 01:58:33,507
Wake him up.
Son--

1920
01:58:33,507 --> 01:58:34,308
wake him!

1921
01:58:34,308 --> 01:58:35,876
We're all real sorry.

1922
01:58:35,876 --> 01:58:37,211
Please wake him up.

1923
01:58:37,211 --> 01:58:39,079
Son, let's go outside.

1924
01:58:39,079 --> 01:58:40,080
Let's go outside.

1925
01:58:40,080 --> 01:58:41,648
No! No!

1926
01:58:41,648 --> 01:58:43,284
I don't want to!

1927
01:58:43,284 --> 01:58:45,619
I don't want to!

1928
01:58:45,619 --> 01:58:47,421
Jackie!

1929
01:58:47,421 --> 01:58:49,556
Wake him up!
Wake him!

1930
01:58:49,556 --> 01:58:50,557
T.j., please--

1931
01:58:50,557 --> 01:58:51,825
I want champ!

1932
01:58:51,825 --> 01:58:53,059
T.j...

01:58:53,059 --> 01:58:54,495
I want champ!

1934
01:58:54,495 --> 01:58:55,296
T.j...

1935
01:58:55,296 --> 01:58:57,698
Please, t.J.,
listen to me.

1936
01:58:57,698 --> 01:58:59,233
He's gone.

1937
01:58:59,233 --> 01:59:00,401
He's gone, son.

1938
01:59:01,802 --> 01:59:03,404
He's gone.

1939
01:59:06,407 --> 01:59:07,408
No.

1940
01:59:10,177 --> 01:59:11,278
No.

1941
01:59:11,278 --> 01:59:13,046
He's not gone.

1942
01:59:13,046 --> 01:59:14,948
He's not.

1943
01:59:14,948 --> 01:59:15,949
He's not.

1944
01:59:15,949 --> 01:59:17,284
Not now.

1945
01:59:17,284 --> 01:59:18,919
It's all right.

1946
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:20,921
Please.

1947
01:59:20,921 --> 01:59:21,955
He is not dead!

1948
01:59:21,955 --> 01:59:22,956
He is not dead!

1949
01:59:22,956 --> 01:59:23,957
Listen to me, son.

1950
01:59:23,957 --> 01:59:25,226
I want champ!

1951
01:59:25,226 --> 01:59:26,260

Champ!

He is not gone!

1955
01:59:32,966 --> 01:59:35,168
Come on, son.

1956
01:59:35,168 --> 01:59:37,103
Come on.

1957

T.j.

1958
01:59:39,806 --> 01:59:41,908
I want champ!
