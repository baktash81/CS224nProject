by Floo powder before, Mum.

169
00:14:16,357 --> 00:14:20,652
You go first, Ron, so that Harry
can see how it's done. Yes.

170

In you go.

00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:25,199
That's it.

Don't be afraid. Come on.

174
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:42,966
Come on.

175
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:46,303
In you go. That's it. Mind your head.

176
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:49,890
That's right.
Now, take your Floo powder.

177
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:53,894
That's it, very good.

178
00:14:54,103 --> 00:14:58,399
Now, don't forget to speak
very, very clearly.

179
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:02,653
Diagonally.

180
00:15:09,118 --> 00:15:11,495
- What did he say, dear?
- Diagonally.

181
00:15:11,662 --> 00:15:12,746
I thought he did.

182
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:44,087
- Not lost, are you, my dear'?
-I'm fine, thank you. I was just going...

187

HAGRID: You're a mess, Harry. Skulking
around Knockturn Alley? Dodgy place.

188
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:11,281
Don't want no one to see you there.
People will think you're up to no good.

189
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:13,659
I was lost, I--

190
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:16,787
Hang on. What were you
doing down there then?

191
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:22,125

for Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.

You'll be all right now then, Harry?
Right. I'll leave you to it.

Nice big smile, Harry.
Together, you and I rate the front page.

Ladies and gentlemen,
what an extraordinary moment this is.

214
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:55,552
When young Harry stepped
into Flourish and Blotts this morning...

215
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:59,848
...to purchase my autobiography,
Magical Me...

216
00:19:03,352 --> 00:19:06,229
...which, incidentally,
is currently celebrating...

217
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:11,234

in fact, be leaving...

Voldemort killed my parents.

235
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:27,561
He was nothing more than a murderer.

236
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:31,523
You must be very brave
to mention his name.

237
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,525
Or very foolish.

238
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:37,487
Fear of a name only increases
fear of the thing itself.

And you must be Miss Granger.

all about you. And your parents.

all those extra raids?

00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:27,704
I do hope they're paying you overtime...

249
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:31,041
...but judging by the state of this,
I'd say not.

250
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:36,546
What's the use in being a disgrace
to the name of wizard...

251
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:38,799
...if they don't even pay you well for it?

252
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:44,095
We have a very different idea about what
disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy.

253
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:46,139

- I don't know.

itself for some reason.

...maybe Mum and Dad can't get back.

00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:35,040

...most Muggles aren't accustomed
to seeing a flying car.

00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:56,353
Right.

- Good morning, Professor Sprout.

337
00:31:33,476 --> 00:31:37,730
SPROUT: Welcome to Greenhouse Three,
second years. Gather around, everyone.

338
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:40,733
Today we're going to re-pot Mandrakes.

339
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:44,904
Who here can tell me
the properties of the Mandrake root?

340
00:31:45,113 --> 00:31:46,906
Yes, Miss Granger?

341
00:31:47,115 --> 00:31:49,409
Mandrake, or Mandragora...

342
00:31:49,617 --> 00:31:54,580
...is used to return those who have been
Petrified to their original state.

343
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:59,752
It's also dangerous. The Mandrake's
cry is fatal to anyone who hears it.

344
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,755
Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor.

345
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:05,633
As our Mandrakes
are still only seedlings...

346
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,677
...their cries won't kill you yet.

347
00:32:07,844 --> 00:32:11,681
But they could knock you out for hours,
which is why I have given you earmuffs...

348
00:32:11,848 --> 00:32:13,349
...for auditory protection.

349
00:32:13,516 --> 00:32:17,937
So could you please put them on,
right away? Quickly.

350
00:32:18,146 --> 00:32:20,898
Flaps tight down,
and watch me closely.

351
00:32:21,065 --> 00:32:24,068
You grasp your Mandrake firmly.

352
00:32:24,235 --> 00:32:27,238
You pull it sharply up out of the pot.

353
00:32:27,447 --> 00:32:29,532
[MANDRAKE SCREAMING]

354
00:32:31,534 --> 00:32:33,411
Got it? And...

355
00:32:33,661 --> 00:32:35,746
...now you dunk it down
into the other pot...

356
00:32:35,913 --> 00:32:40,668
...and pour a little sprinkling of soil
to keep him warm.

357
00:32:44,255 --> 00:32:47,467
Longbottom's been neglecting
his earmuffs.

358
00:32:47,884 --> 00:32:51,929
- No, ma'am, he's just fainted.
- Yes, well, just leave him there.

359
00:32:52,305 --> 00:32:55,892
Right, on we go.
Plenty of pots to go around.

360
00:32:56,058 --> 00:32:59,604
Grasp your Mandrake and pull it up.

361
00:33:14,577 --> 00:33:18,331
BOY: There's Nearly Headless Nick.
- Hello, Percy, Miss Clearwater.

362
00:33:18,498 --> 00:33:21,083
PERCY:
Hello, Sir Nicholas.

363
00:33:32,512 --> 00:33:35,806
Say it. I'm doomed.

364
00:33:36,641 --> 00:33:38,601
- You're doomed.
BOY: Hi, Harry.

365
00:33:40,811 --> 00:33:43,523
I'm Colin Creevey. I'm in Gryffindor too.

366
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:45,316
Hi, Colin. Nice to meet you.

367
00:33:45,858 --> 00:33:47,735
Ron, is that your owl?

368
00:33:58,788 --> 00:34:01,666
[LAUGHING]

369
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:05,127
Bloody bird's a menace.

370
00:34:09,298 --> 00:34:10,800
Oh, no.

371
00:34:10,967 --> 00:34:14,470
Look, everyone.
Weasley's got himself a Howler.

372
00:34:15,888 --> 00:34:21,143
Go on, Ron. I ignored one
from my gran once. It was horrible.

373
00:34:28,317 --> 00:34:30,194
MRS. WEASLEY'S VOICE:
Ronald Weasley!

374
00:34:32,822 --> 00:34:38,911
<i>How dare you steal that car!
I am absolutely disgusted!</i>

375
00:34:39,203 --> 00:34:41,831
<i>Your father's now facing
an inquiry at work...</i>

376
00:34:41,998 --> 00:34:44,333
<i>...and it's entirely your fault!</i>

377
00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:48,671
<i>If you put another toe out of line...</i>

378
00:34:48,838 --> 00:34:52,091
<i>...we'll bring you straight home!</i>

379
00:34:52,883 --> 00:34:56,387
<i>And, Ginny, dear, congratulations
on making Gryffindor.</i>

380
00:34:56,554 --> 00:35:00,308
<i>Your father and I are so proud.</i>

381
00:35:18,534 --> 00:35:24,957
Let me introduce you to your new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

382
00:35:25,124 --> 00:35:26,709
Me.

383
00:35:26,876 --> 00:35:29,378
Gilderoy Lockhart...

384
00:35:29,545 --> 00:35:32,882
...Order of Merlin, Third Class...

385
00:35:33,049 --> 00:35:36,385
...honorary member
of the Dark Force Defense League...

386
00:35:36,552 --> 00:35:39,430
...and five times winner...

387
00:35:39,764 --> 00:35:45,645
...of <i>Witch Weekly's</i>
Most-Charming-Smile Award.

388
00:35:46,062 --> 00:35:47,563
But I don't talk about that.

389
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:52,234
I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee
by smiling at him.

390
00:35:55,988 --> 00:35:58,866
Now, be warned.

391
00:35:59,116 --> 00:36:01,160
It is my job to arm you...

392
00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:06,666
...against the foulest creatures
known to wizardkind.

393
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,087
You may find yourselves facing
your worst fears in this room.

394
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:15,299
Know only that no harm
can befall you whilst I am here.

395
00:36:15,466 --> 00:36:18,427
I must ask you not to scream.

396
00:36:18,594 --> 00:36:21,138
It might provoke them.

397
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,143
Cornish pixies?

398
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:29,397
LOCKHART:
Freshly caught Cornish pixies.

399
00:36:30,147 --> 00:36:32,274
Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnegan...

400
00:36:32,441 --> 00:36:36,612
...but pixies can be
devilishly tricky little blighters.

401
00:36:36,779 --> 00:36:39,699
Let's see what you make of them.

402
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:47,289
Come on now, round them up.
They're only pixies.

403
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:07,184
PIXIE: You just stay there!
NEVILLE: Please, get me down!

404
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,981
HERMIONE: Get off me!
- Stop. Hold still!

405
00:37:13,649 --> 00:37:16,819
<i>Peskipiksi Pesternomi!</i>

406
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:41,093
I'll ask you three to just nip
the rest of them back into their cage.

407
00:37:42,845 --> 00:37:45,014
What do we do now?

408
00:37:46,515 --> 00:37:48,017
<i>Immobulus!</i>

409
00:37:57,526 --> 00:37:59,737
Why is it always me?

410
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:08,788
I spent the summer devising
a whole new Quidditch program.

411
00:38:08,996 --> 00:38:12,625
We're gonna train earlier,
harder and longer.

412
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:16,086
What--? I don't believe it.

413
00:38:18,881 --> 00:38:21,592
- Where you think you're going, Flint?
- Quidditch practice.

414
00:38:21,759 --> 00:38:26,138
- I booked the pitch for Gryffindor today.
- Easy, Wood. I've got a note.

415
00:38:27,556 --> 00:38:29,767
Uh-oh. I smell trouble.

416
00:38:30,392 --> 00:38:33,896
"L, Professor Severus Snape,
do hereby give the Slytherin team...

417
00:38:34,063 --> 00:38:37,566
...permission to practice today, owing
to the need to train their new Seeker."

418
00:38:37,733 --> 00:38:40,402
You've got a new Seeker. Who?

419
00:38:44,406 --> 00:38:46,992
- Malfoy?
- That's right.

420
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:49,954
And that's not all
that's new this year.

421
00:38:50,788 --> 00:38:54,250
Those are Nimbus 2001 s.
How did you get those?

422
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:56,460
A gift from Draco's father.

423
00:38:56,627 --> 00:39:00,422
You see, Weasley, unlike some,
my father can afford the best.

424
00:39:00,589 --> 00:39:03,592
At least no one on the Gryffindor team
had to buy their way in.

425
00:39:03,759 --> 00:39:06,637
They got in on pure talent.

426
00:39:09,849 --> 00:39:13,769
No one asked your opinion,
you filthy little Mudblood.

427
00:39:16,272 --> 00:39:19,692
You'll pay for that one, Malfoy.
Eat slugs!

428
00:39:27,283 --> 00:39:29,118
You okay, Ron?

429
00:39:32,121 --> 00:39:33,956
Say something.

430
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:44,675
- Wow! Can you turn him around, Harry?
HARRY: No, Colin, get out of the way.

431
00:39:45,634 --> 00:39:47,636
Let's take him to Hagrid's.

432
00:39:47,803 --> 00:39:49,972
He'll know what to do.

433
00:39:58,814 --> 00:40:02,192
HAGRID: This calls for
a specialist's equipment.

434
00:40:05,988 --> 00:40:09,533
Nothing to do but wait till it stops,
I'm afraid.

435
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,370
- Okay.
- Better out than in.

436
00:40:13,996 --> 00:40:19,335
- Who was Ron trying to curse, anyway?
- Malfoy. He called Hermione...

437
00:40:20,502 --> 00:40:23,923
Well, I don't know
exactly what it means.

438
00:40:27,885 --> 00:40:30,095
He called me a Mudblood.

439
00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:32,932
- He did not.
- What's a Mudblood?

440
00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:37,853
It means "dirty blood." Mudblood's a foul
name for someone who's Muggle-born.

441
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:42,274
Someone with non-magic parents.
Someone like me.

442
00:40:42,775 --> 00:40:46,904
It's not a term one usually hears
in civilized conversation.

443
00:40:48,072 --> 00:40:52,868
See, the thing is, Harry, there are
some wizards, like the Malfoy family...

444
00:40:53,035 --> 00:40:57,706
...who think they're better than everyone
else because they're pure-blood.

445
00:40:57,873 --> 00:40:59,541
That's horrible.

446
00:41:02,544 --> 00:41:03,879
It's disgusting.

447
00:41:04,046 --> 00:41:07,549
And it's codswallop to boot.
Dirty blood.

448
00:41:07,716 --> 00:41:11,053
Why, there isn't a wizard alive today
that's not half-blood or less.

449
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:15,766
More to the point, they've yet to think
of a spell that our Hermione can't do.

450
00:41:15,933 --> 00:41:18,185
Come here.

451
00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:25,734
Don't you think on it, Hermione.
Don't you think on it for one minute.

452
00:41:26,276 --> 00:41:27,611
Aye?

453
00:41:33,492 --> 00:41:36,578
LOCKHART:
Harry, Harry, Harry.

454
00:41:36,745 --> 00:41:38,956
Can you possibly imagine...

455
00:41:39,123 --> 00:41:42,334
...a better way to serve detention...

456
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,671
...than by helping me
to answer my fan mail?

457
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:47,256
Not really.

458
00:41:47,423 --> 00:41:53,804
Fame is a fickle friend, Harry.
Celebrity is as celebrity does.

459
00:41:53,971 --> 00:41:55,931
Remember that.

460
00:41:59,643 --> 00:42:01,812

- What?
- Sorry?

464
00:42:16,326 --> 00:42:18,287
That voice.

465
00:42:18,454 --> 00:42:19,997
Voice?

466
00:42:23,542 --> 00:42:28,172
- Didn't you hear it?
- What are you talking about, Harry?

467
00:42:28,797 --> 00:42:32,384
I think you're getting
a bit drowsy.

468
00:42:32,551 --> 00:42:36,638
And great Scott, no wonder. Look at the
time. We've been here nearly four hours.

469
00:42:36,972 --> 00:42:40,309
Spooky how the time flies
when one is having fun.

470
00:42:45,314 --> 00:42:47,816
Spooky.

471
00:42:50,861 --> 00:42:52,988

<i>- Kill!
- Harry!</i>

00:43:12,049 --> 00:43:14,551
HARRY: Did you hear it?
- Hear what?

479
00:43:14,718 --> 00:43:18,180
- That voice.
- Voice? What voice?

480
00:43:18,347 --> 00:43:22,309
I heard it first in Lockhart's office.
And then again just--

481
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:24,686
<i>It's time.</i>

482
00:43:24,853 --> 00:43:28,023
It's moving.
I think it's going to kill.

483
00:43:29,024 --> 00:43:32,945
RON: Kill?
HERMIONE: Harry, wait! Not so fast!

484
00:43:58,554 --> 00:44:00,597
Strange.

485
00:44:01,098 --> 00:44:05,602
- I’ve never seen spiders act like that.
- I don't like spiders.

486
00:44:09,731 --> 00:44:11,775
What's that?

487
00:44:15,237 --> 00:44:17,739
HERMIONE: "The Chamber
of Secrets has been opened.

488
00:44:17,948 --> 00:44:19,783
Enemies of the Heir, beware."

489
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:22,244
It's written in blood.

490
00:44:25,122 --> 00:44:27,291
Oh, no.

491
00:44:32,004 --> 00:44:34,298
It's Filch's cat.

492
00:44:34,798 --> 00:44:37,092
It's Mrs. Norris.

493
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:55,903
"Enemies of the Heir, beware."

494
00:44:57,404 --> 00:44:59,781
You'll be next, Mudbloods.

495
00:44:59,948 --> 00:45:05,120
What's going on here?
Go on. Make way, make way.

496
00:45:06,538 --> 00:45:08,373

00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:10,667
What are you...?

498
00:45:14,004 --> 00:45:16,298
Mrs. Norris?

499
00:45:17,799 --> 00:45:21,970
- You've murdered my cat.
- No.No.

500
00:45:22,346 --> 00:45:23,639
FILCH:
I'll kill you.

501

Argus, l...

00:45:34,358 --> 00:45:38,987
Everyone will proceed
to their dormitories immediately.

504
00:45:39,696 --> 00:45:41,698
Everyone except...

505
00:45:42,491 --> 00:45:44,701
...you three.

506
00:45:46,828 --> 00:45:49,581
BOY:
Ravenclaws, follow me.

507
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:55,337
She's not dead, Argus.
She has been Petrified.

508
00:45:55,504 --> 00:45:58,340
Ah. Thought so.
So unlucky I wasn't there.

509
00:45:58,507 --> 00:46:01,718
I know exactly the countercurse
that could've spared her.

510
00:46:04,054 --> 00:46:06,682
But how she has been Petrified,
l cannot say.

511
00:46:06,974 --> 00:46:09,685
Ask him.
It's him that's done it.

512
00:46:09,851 --> 00:46:12,521
You saw what he wrote on the wall.

513
00:46:12,688 --> 00:46:16,775
It's not true, sir. I swear.
I never touched Mrs. Norris.

514
00:46:16,984 --> 00:46:21,405
- Rubbish.
- If I might, headmaster?

515
00:46:21,863 --> 00:46:26,702
Perhaps Potter and his friends were just
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

516
00:46:27,202 --> 00:46:29,079
However...

517
00:46:29,413 --> 00:46:32,374
...the circumstances are suspicious.

518
00:46:32,541 --> 00:46:37,212
I, for one, don't recall
seeing Potter at dinner.

519
00:46:37,379 --> 00:46:39,589
LOCKHART:
I'm afraid that's my doing, Severus.

520
00:46:39,756 --> 00:46:43,218
You see, Harry was helping me
answer my fan mail.

521
00:46:43,385 --> 00:46:46,638
HERMIONE: That's why Ron and I
went looking for him, professor.

522
00:46:46,805 --> 00:46:49,558
We'd just found him when he said...

523
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:55,647
- Yes, Miss Granger?
- When I said I wasn't hungry.

524
00:46:57,065 --> 00:47:01,069
We were heading back to the common
room when we found Mrs. Norris.

525
00:47:03,405 --> 00:47:08,910
-Innocent until proven guilty, Severus.
FILCH: My cat has been Petrified.

526
00:47:09,745 --> 00:47:15,584
- I want to see some punishment!
- We will be able to cure her, Argus.

527
00:47:16,543 --> 00:47:21,298
As I understand it, Madam Sprout
has a very healthy growth of Mandrake.

528
00:47:21,465 --> 00:47:25,927
When matured, a potion will be made
which will revive Mrs. Norris.

529
00:47:26,261 --> 00:47:27,929
And in the meantime...

530
00:47:28,472 --> 00:47:32,476
...l strongly recommend caution...

531
00:47:33,143 --> 00:47:35,145
...to all.

532
00:47:46,156 --> 00:47:49,618
HERMIONE: It's a bit strange, isn't it?
- Strange?

533
00:47:49,785 --> 00:47:52,537
HERMIONE: You hear this voice,
a voice only you can hear...

534
00:47:52,704 --> 00:47:57,459
...and then Mrs. Norris turns up
Petrified. It's just strange.

535
00:47:57,626 --> 00:48:00,837
Do you think I should have told them?
Dumbledore and the others, I mean?

536
00:48:01,004 --> 00:48:02,464
Are you mad?

537
00:48:02,631 --> 00:48:08,136
No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world,
hearing voices isn't a good sign.

538
00:48:10,222 --> 00:48:12,641
MAN IN PICTURE:
She's right, you know.

539
00:48:16,978 --> 00:48:19,314
MCGONAGALL: Could I have
your attention, please?

540
00:48:19,815 --> 00:48:25,320
Right. Now, today,
we will be transforming animals...

541
00:48:25,487 --> 00:48:27,864
...into water goblets.

542
00:48:28,824 --> 00:48:30,492
Like so.

543
00:48:30,659 --> 00:48:35,539
One, two, three.
Vera Verto.

544
00:48:39,126 --> 00:48:43,004
Now it's your turn.
Who would like to go first?

545
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:48,552
Mr. Weasley.
"One, two, three. Vera Verto."

546
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:54,224
<i>Vera Verto!</i>

547
00:49:00,355 --> 00:49:03,024
MCGONAGALL: That wand needs
replacing, Mr. Weasley.

548
00:49:04,359 --> 00:49:06,528
- Yes, Miss Granger?
- Professor...

549
00:49:06,695 --> 00:49:10,907
...l was wondering if you could tell us
about the Chamber of Secrets.

550
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,373
Very well.

551
00:49:19,875 --> 00:49:21,877
You all know, of course...

552
00:49:22,043 --> 00:49:25,881
...that Hogwarts was founded
over a thousand years ago...

553
00:49:26,047 --> 00:49:30,469
...by the four greatest witches
and wizards of the age:

554
00:49:30,677 --> 00:49:34,389
Godric Gryffindor,
Helga Hufflepuff...

555
00:49:34,556 --> 00:49:40,228
...Rowena Ravenclaw
and Salazar Slytherin.

556
00:49:40,896 --> 00:49:46,902
Now, three of the founders
coexisted quite harmoniously.

557
00:49:47,068 --> 00:49:50,071
- One did not.
- Three guesses who.

558
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:53,241
Salazar Slytherin wished to be
more selective...

559
00:49:53,408 --> 00:49:56,578
...about the students admitted
to Hogwarts.

560
00:49:56,745 --> 00:50:01,333
He believed magical learning should
be kept within all-magic families.

561
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,627
In other words, pure-bloods.

562
00:50:04,002 --> 00:50:09,341
Unable to sway the others,
he decided to leave the school.

563
00:50:10,217 --> 00:50:12,427
Now, according to legend...

564
00:50:12,594 --> 00:50:16,306
...Slytherin had built
a hidden chamber in this castle...

565
00:50:16,473 --> 00:50:20,143
...known as the Chamber of Secrets.

566
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:24,773
Though, shortly before departing,
he sealed it...

567
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:29,027
...until that time when his own
true Heir returned to the school.

568
00:50:29,236 --> 00:50:31,613
The Heir alone...

569
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:34,449
...would be able to open the Chamber...

570
00:50:34,616 --> 00:50:39,329
...and unleash the horror within,
and by so doing...

571
00:50:39,496 --> 00:50:42,874
...purge the school
of all those who...

572
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:48,046
...in Slytherin's view,
were unworthy to study magic.

573
00:50:48,672 --> 00:50:50,799
Muggle-borns.

574
00:50:51,841 --> 00:50:55,470
Naturally, the school
has been searched many times.

575
00:50:55,637 --> 00:50:59,140
No such chamber has been found.

576
00:50:59,683 --> 00:51:04,354
Professor? What exactly does legend
tell us lies within the Chamber?

577
00:51:05,188 --> 00:51:07,816
The Chamber is said to be home
to something...

578
00:51:07,983 --> 00:51:11,528
...that only the Heir of Slytherin
can control.

579
00:51:12,153 --> 00:51:15,824
It is said to be the home...

580
00:51:15,991 --> 00:51:17,576
...of a monster.

581
00:51:23,331 --> 00:51:27,002
Do you think it's true? Do you think
there really is a Chamber of Secrets?

582
00:51:27,168 --> 00:51:31,381
Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall's
worried. All the teachers are.

583
00:51:31,548 --> 00:51:35,385
If there really is a Chamber of Secrets,
and it has been opened, that means--

584
00:51:35,552 --> 00:51:39,514
The Heir of Slytherin has returned
to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?

585
00:51:39,681 --> 00:51:44,060
Let's think. Who do we know who
thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?

586
00:51:44,227 --> 00:51:46,896
- If you're talking about Malfoy--
- Of course. You heard him.

587
00:51:47,063 --> 00:51:48,773
"You'll be next, Mudbloods."

588
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:51,568
I heard him.
But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?

589
00:51:51,735 --> 00:51:54,904
Maybe Ron's right, Hermione.
I mean, look at his family.

590
00:51:55,071 --> 00:51:57,866
The whole lot of them have been
in Slytherin for centuries.

591
00:51:58,033 --> 00:52:01,453
Crabbe and Goyle must know.
Maybe we could trick them into telling.

592
00:52:01,911 --> 00:52:06,082
Even they aren't that thick.
But there might be another way.

593
00:52:06,249 --> 00:52:08,084
Mind you, it would be difficult.

594
00:52:08,251 --> 00:52:11,296
Not to mention we'd be breaking
about 50 school rules...

595
00:52:11,463 --> 00:52:15,925
...and it'll be dangerous.
Very dangerous.

596
00:52:22,766 --> 00:52:25,226
HERMIONE:
Here it is. The Polyjuice Potion.

597
00:52:25,393 --> 00:52:28,104
"Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion
allows the drinker...

598
00:52:28,271 --> 00:52:32,567
...to transform himself temporarily
into the physical form of another."

599
00:52:32,734 --> 00:52:36,488
You mean if Harry and I drink that stuff,
we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?

600
00:52:36,655 --> 00:52:40,075
- Wicked! Malfoy will tell us anything.
- Exactly.

601
00:52:40,241 --> 00:52:44,079
But it's tricky. I've never seen
a more complicated potion.

602
00:52:44,245 --> 00:52:47,374
HARRY: How long will it take to make?
- A month.

603
00:52:47,749 --> 00:52:49,167
A month?

604
00:52:49,376 --> 00:52:53,171
But, Hermione,
if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin...

605
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:56,591
...he could attack half
the Muggle-borns in the school by then.

606
00:52:56,758 --> 00:52:58,635
I know.

607
00:52:58,802 --> 00:53:01,638
But it's the only plan we've got.

609
00:53:51,312 --> 00:53:54,023
Another goal for Slytherin!

610
00:53:55,483 --> 00:53:58,737
They lead Gryffindor 90 to 30.

00:53:59,946 --> 00:54:01,489
Yeah!

00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:03,533

00:55:01,591 --> 00:55:06,221
No! Even with a proper wand,
it's too risky. You could hit Harry.

620
00:55:31,246 --> 00:55:33,832
Training for the ballet, Potter?

621
00:56:04,821 --> 00:56:07,073
You'll never catch me, Potter.

00:57:37,872 --> 00:57:38,915

No. I think my arm is broken.

Not to worry. I will fix
that arm of yours straightaway.

00:58:38,141 --> 00:58:42,270
...you can no longer feel any pain, and,
very clearly, the bones are not broken.

634

straight to me.

You will be able to, won't you?

00:59:01,831 --> 00:59:04,959
I'll be able to, certainly.
But it'll be painful.

You're in for a rough night, Potter.
Regrowing bones is a nasty business.

Hello.

648
00:59:44,499 --> 00:59:45,541
Dobby?

649
00:59:45,708 --> 00:59:48,044
Harry Potter should have listened
to Dobby.

650
00:59:48,503 --> 00:59:52,215
Harry Potter should have gone back home
when he missed the train.

651
00:59:52,381 --> 00:59:57,011
It was you. You stopped the barrier
from letting Ron and me through.

652
00:59:57,345 --> 01:00:00,306
Indeed. Yes, sir.

653
01:00:01,307 --> 01:00:06,354
- You nearly got Ron and me expelled.
- At least you would be away from here.

654
01:00:06,521 --> 01:00:09,190
Harry Potter must go home.

655
01:00:09,357 --> 01:00:12,902
Dobby thought his Bludger would be
enough to make Harry Potter see--

656
01:00:13,069 --> 01:00:16,447
Your Bludger? You made
that Bludger chase after me?

657
01:00:16,614 --> 01:00:20,201
Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir.

658
01:00:20,368 --> 01:00:24,038
Dobby had to iron his hands.

659
01:00:26,207 --> 01:00:30,837
You better clear off before my bones
come back, or I might strangle you.

660
01:00:33,422 --> 01:00:35,424
Dobby is used to death threats, sir.

661
01:00:35,591 --> 01:00:38,636
Dobby gets them five times a day
at home.

662

I don't suppose you could tell me
why you're trying to kill me?

Not kill you, sir.
Never kill you.

01:18:00,177 --> 01:18:02,971
We also need to make sure
that the real Crabbe and Goyle...

842
01:18:03,138 --> 01:18:06,391
...can't burst in on us
while we're interrogating Malfoy.

843
01:18:06,683 --> 01:18:09,436
- How?
-I've got it all worked out.

844
01:18:09,603 --> 01:18:12,147
I filled these
with a simple Sleeping Draught.

845
01:18:12,314 --> 01:18:15,108
Simple, but powerful.

846
01:18:15,275 --> 01:18:17,444
Now, once they're asleep...

847
01:18:17,611 --> 01:18:20,822
...hide them in the broomstick cupboard
and pull out a few of their hairs...

848
01:18:20,989 --> 01:18:22,866
...and put on their uniforms.

849
01:18:23,033 --> 01:18:26,328
- Whose hair are you ripping out, then?
- I've already got mine.

850
01:18:26,494 --> 01:18:29,664
Millicent Bulstrode. Slytherin.

851
01:18:29,831 --> 01:18:32,000
I got this off her robes.

852
01:18:32,167 --> 01:18:34,794
I'm going to go check
on the Polyjuice Potion.

853
01:18:34,961 --> 01:18:37,672
Make sure that Crabbe and Goyle
find these.

[CLEARS THROAT]

855
01:18:49,809 --> 01:18:52,187
Ron, maybe I should do it.

856
01:18:52,354 --> 01:18:54,439
Yeah. Right.

Come on, let's get them.

HERMIONE: We'll have exactly one hour
before we change back into ourselves.

862
01:19:52,205 --> 01:19:54,124
Add the hairs.

863
01:19:57,585 --> 01:20:00,422
Ugh. Essence of Crabbe.

01:20:00,588 --> 01:20:02,507
HERMIONE:
Cheers.

865
01:20:11,224 --> 01:20:13,601
I think I'm gonna be sick.

866
01:20:16,563 --> 01:20:18,398

Bloody hell!

871
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:12,994
We still sound like ourselves.

872
01:21:13,161 --> 01:21:14,954
You need to sound more like Crabbe.

873
01:21:16,122 --> 01:21:18,375
- Bloody hell.
- Excellent.

874
01:21:18,708 --> 01:21:21,211
- But where's Hermione?
HERMIONE: l...

875
01:21:21,378 --> 01:21:24,381
I don't think I'm going.
You go on without me.

876

Hermione, are you okay?

877
01:21:26,466 --> 01:21:29,302
HERMIONE:
Just go. You're wasting time.

878
01:21:31,346 --> 01:21:33,014
Come on.

879
01:21:36,518 --> 01:21:40,397
- The Slytherin common room's this way.
- Okay.

Excuse me.

I mean, what are you doing down here?

883
01:21:53,201 --> 01:21:55,912
I happen to be a school prefect.

884
01:21:56,121 --> 01:22:00,542
You, on the other hand, have no business
wandering the corridors at night.

- Crabbe, Goyle, where have you been?

01:22:07,340 --> 01:22:10,343

all this time?

888
01:22:11,845 --> 01:22:14,180
Why are you wearing glasses?

889
01:22:15,014 --> 01:22:17,851
- Reading.
- Reading?

890
01:22:19,018 --> 01:22:21,271
I didn't know you could read.

891
01:22:24,190 --> 01:22:26,234
And what are you doing down here,
Weasley?

892
01:22:26,401 --> 01:22:28,445
Mind your attitude, Malfoy.

893
01:22:37,245 --> 01:22:39,247
Well, sit down.

894
01:22:42,041 --> 01:22:45,879
You'd never know the Weasleys
were pure-bloods, the way they behave.

895
01:22:46,087 --> 01:22:49,924
They're an embarrassment
to the wizarding world. All of them.

896
01:22:50,758 --> 01:22:53,052
What's wrong with you, Crabbe?

897
01:22:55,263 --> 01:22:57,056
Stomachache.

898
01:22:59,058 --> 01:23:03,897
I'm surprised the <i>Daily</i> Prophet
hasn't done a report on all these attacks.

899
01:23:04,063 --> 01:23:06,483
I suppose Dumbledore
is trying to hush it all up.

900
01:23:06,733 --> 01:23:09,152
Father always said Dumbledore
was the worst thing...

901
01:23:09,319 --> 01:23:13,114
-...that ever happened to this place.
- You're wrong!

902
01:23:20,622 --> 01:23:21,789
What?

903
01:23:21,956 --> 01:23:25,627
You think there's someone here
who's worse than Dumbledore?

904
01:23:25,793 --> 01:23:28,254
Well? Do you?

905
01:23:28,755 --> 01:23:30,632
Harry Potter?

906
01:23:37,222 --> 01:23:38,598
Good one, Goyle.

907
01:23:38,765 --> 01:23:40,308
You're absolutely right.

908
01:23:40,975 --> 01:23:42,810
Saint Potter.

909
01:23:43,811 --> 01:23:46,606
And people actually think
that he's the Heir of Slytherin?

910
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:52,987
But then you must have some idea
who's behind it all.

911
01:23:53,154 --> 01:23:56,824
You know I don't, Goyle.
I told you yesterday.

912
01:23:57,825 --> 01:24:00,328
How many times do I have to tell you?

913
01:24:01,329 --> 01:24:03,164
Is this yours?

914
01:24:07,627 --> 01:24:10,004
But my father did say this:

915
01:24:10,380 --> 01:24:13,299
It's been 50 years
since the Chamber was opened.

916
01:24:13,466 --> 01:24:17,845
He wouldn't tell me who opened it.
Only that they were expelled.

917
01:24:18,137 --> 01:24:22,809
The last time the Chamber of Secrets
was opened, a Mudblood died.

918
01:24:22,976 --> 01:24:27,313
So it's only a matter of time
before one of them is killed this time.

919
01:24:27,855 --> 01:24:29,691

920
01:24:29,857 --> 01:24:32,026
...l hope it's Granger.

What's the matter with you two?

01:24:34,571 --> 01:24:37,073
You're acting very odd.

923
01:24:37,282 --> 01:24:39,492
It's his stomachache.

01:25:04,434 --> 01:25:05,727
That was close.

Do you remember me telling you...

935
01:25:24,245 --> 01:25:27,415
...that the Polyjuice Potion
was only for human transformations?

936
01:25:27,582 --> 01:25:31,711
It was cat hair I plucked off
Millicent Bulstrode's robes.

940
01:25:47,393 --> 01:25:49,937
She should be out of hospital
in a few days...

01:25:50,104 --> 01:25:52,940
...when she stops coughing up fur balls.

01:26:28,893 --> 01:26:32,939
Don't ask me. Here I am,
minding my own business...

to throw a book at me.

throws something at you.

...is make sure the thing that killed

It just can't be.

What would any of us have done?

Look, Hagrid's our friend. Why don't
we just go and ask him about it?

Tell us, have you been setting anything
mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?"

of that brainless oaf Hagrid...

- Hagrid's my friend.

- It was my word against Hagrid's.

he was innocent.

Who was it?

1509
02:22:48,269 --> 02:22:51,647
- Voldemort.
- Ah.

1510
02:22:51,981 --> 02:22:57,403
Only this time he chose to act
through somebody else...

1511
02:22:57,987 --> 02:23:01,574
...by means of this.

1512
02:23:04,285 --> 02:23:05,828

our young Mr. Potter discovered it.

One hopes that no more of Lord
Voldemort's old school-things...

1515

...should find their way
into innocent hands.

1516
02:23:19,217 --> 02:23:23,179
The consequences for the one
responsible would be...

1517
02:23:23,513 --> 02:23:25,389
...severe.

02:23:26,849 --> 02:23:29,602
Well, let us hope...

...that Mr. Potter will always
be around to save the day.

Mr. Malfoy!

I have something of yours.

Mine? I don't know
what you're talking about.

Oh, I think you do, sir.

1530
02:24:36,586 --> 02:24:39,672
I think you slipped the diary
into Ginny Weasley's cauldron...

Why don't you prove it?

Come, Dobby.

1535
02:25:04,655 --> 02:25:06,699

with clothes.

meddlesome fools too.

Mark my words, Potter.
One day soon...

...you are going to meet
the same sticky end.
