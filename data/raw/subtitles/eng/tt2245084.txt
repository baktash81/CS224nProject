Uh, who's Fred?

186
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,799
-This guy, right here!
-(SCREAMS)

187
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,479
Ah-ah. Don't be alarmed.
It is just a suit.

188
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:05,080
This is not
my real face and body.

189
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,320
The name's Fred.

190
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,400

but by night...

So, what's your major?

194
00:10:14,479 --> 00:10:15,599
No, no, no, I'm not a student.

195
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,760
But I am a major science enthusiast.

196
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,960
I've been trying to get
Honey to develop a formula,

197
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:24,119
that can turn me into a
fire-breathing lizard at will.

198

But she's says that's "not science."

199
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,760
It's really not.

200
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:29,479
Yeah, and I guess the shrink ray

201
00:10:29,599 --> 00:10:32,440
I asked Wasabi for isn't "science" either.

202
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:33,640
- Is it?
- Nope.

203
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,479
Well, then, what about
"invisible sandwich"?

204
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,679
- TADASHI: Hiro.
- lmagine eating a sandwich,

205
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:40,799

just thinks you're crazy.

206

HONEY LEMON: What?

208
00:10:43,359 --> 00:10:45,119
FRED: Tingly fingers?
WASABI: Never gonna happen.

209

a growth serum, huh?

210
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,440

you been working on?

211

Your personal
healthcare companion.

222
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,559
I was alerted to the need

223
00:11:35,719 --> 00:11:39,000
for medical attention
when you said, "Ow."

224
00:11:39,239 --> 00:11:41,359
A robotic nurse.

225
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:45,359
On a scale of 1 to 10,
how would you rate your pain?

226
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:47,359
Physical or emotional?

227
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,679
I will scan you now.

230

You have a slight epidermal
abrasion on your forearm.

231
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,440
I suggest
an anti-bacterial spray.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

233
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,119
What's in the spray, specifically?

234
00:12:03,359 --> 00:12:06,200
The primary ingredient is bacitracin.

235
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,520
(CLICKS TONGUE)
That's a bummer.

236
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:08,880
I'm actually allergic to that.

237
00:12:09,119 --> 00:12:10,960
You are not allergic to bacitracin.

238
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,239
You do have a mild allergy to

239
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:14,559
peanuts.

240
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:16,200
Hmm. Not bad.

241
00:12:16,479 --> 00:12:18,880
You've done some serious
coding on this thing, huh?

242
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:22,039
Uh-huh. Programmed him with
over 10,000 medical procedures.

makes Baymax, Baymax.

Yeah, going for a non-threatening,
huggable kind of thing.

a walking marshmallow.

- No offence.
- BAYMAX: I am a robot.

248
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:38,080

Right. Even lighter. (GASPS)

254

Where did you get those?

255

Oh, machined them
right here, in—house.

Nice.

you are satisfied with your care.

Well then,
I'm satisfied with my care.

a lot of people.

Hey, what kind of battery
does it use?

265

Lithium ion.

266

would charge way faster.

his career in bot-fighting.

Well, kind of serious.

292
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,880
I can see why.

293
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:09,000
With your bot,
winning must come easy.

294
00:14:09,239 --> 00:14:10,919
Yeah, I guess.
