I hate television.
It gives me headaches.

Thank you Ross.

98
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,790
There's a developing story
in Middleburg at this hour.

99
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,800
A mysterious
crop circle appeared

100
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,770
in local farmer Tom Logan's
cornfield.

101
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:16,400
Elaborate prank
or extraterrestrial phenomenon?

102
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:19,630
We'll update you as soon as we
have any further information.

103
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,940
But either way
it's clear something strange

104

is happening in that small town.

- Cindy you got a second?
- Sure.

109
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,020
I want you to take a look at
this for that strip club exposÃ©.

110
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:39,150
But I'd rather stick with
the crop circle story.

111
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,530
Oh come on. You know
those things are just a hoax.

112
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,500
No I'm telling you I sense
something about that cornfield.

or ESPN or both.

120
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,010
The report
on breast augmentation?

121
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,480

Just as sure
as the sun will rise.

151
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,360
Sounds like a long shot.

152
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,690
Look there's always
an explanation

153
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,890
for all this so-called
phenomena.

154
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,190
Maybe you're right.

155
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,460
It was probably
just the Kreisels.

156
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,300
And when I get through
with them

157
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,810
I doubt you'll be seeing
anything strange on this farm

158

for a long time.

159

That's the last time I try to
bring anyone back from the dead.

731
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,220
George don't get down
on yourself.

732
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,230
I know you were only trying
to help.

733
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:08,360
You're a good caring person.

734
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:10,630
Which is why I like you.

735
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,030
Oh thanks Cindy.

736
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,300
But I don't want to
screw your life up too.

737
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:16,360
The most caring thing I could do
for everyone right now

738
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,030
is to just get out of here.

739
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:21,140
George!
What about Sue?

740
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:24,110
Oh yes.
Of course.

741
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,950
Once I get Sue then...

742

Wait!

743
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:32,090
I could really use a friend
right now.

744
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:38,320
Brenda's gone.
Cody resents me.

745

I can't even...

Oh God it's so hard!

747

you're pressing up against me.

Look Cindy.

749
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:56,050
I know you'd never consider
going out with a guy like me.

750
00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:00,480
But if you're not too busy
tomorrow night...

751
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,650
Is that a yes?

752
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,090
Yes.

753
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:15,300
Cindy did Brenda
ever talk to you about a tape?

754
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:17,270
She did mention something.

755
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,570
Do you mind if I go upstairs
and look around?

756
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,900
Yes go.
Of course. Go.

757
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:25,070

1069
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:51,190
Sir I think you need
to go on TV

1070

and convince the people that
there is no such thing as a UFO.

- "May have been"?

1077
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,480
Well there was
a terrible mix-up.

1078
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:13,350
It was Thanksgiving.

1079
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:15,830
The body was sent down
to the kitchen.

1080
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:19,730
They shoved stuffing up its ass
and we ate it at a state dinner.

That's the last I saw of it.

No scratch that.

There were some sandwiches
made the next day.

to put my pants on again?

No sir. It's just a feeling
I've been having

1089
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,740
since the news about the aliens.

1090

- Something's not right.
- I know what you mean.

It's like that feeling
that something's not right.

What is the connection between
the crop circles and the tape?

00:54:29,790 --> 00:54:30,950
The answer is simple.

1106

You are the eventuality
of an anomaly.

00:59:44,010 --> 00:59:46,100
Everybody clear!

1236
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:51,140
This way sir!
God this is exciting!

1237
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:54,120
You're excited?
You should feel my nipples.

1238
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:55,980
Cody?

1239
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:59,110
Cody?
Cody where are you?

1240
00:59:59,190 --> 01:00:00,380
Honey?

1241
01:00:00,460 --> 01:00:02,790
GIGGINS: After today's incident
in the East Room

1242
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:05,350
the White House
is now advising all citizens

1243
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:09,160
to board up their homes and
prepare for an alien invasion.

1244
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:11,170
Oh no.

1245
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:13,670
And now a News 8 exclusive.

1246
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:16,070
The killer videotape
you've been hearing about.

1247
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:17,700
We're the only station
that has it

1248
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,440
and we're showing it all night.

1249
01:00:19,510 --> 01:00:21,500
Very exciting.
Let's roll it again.

1250
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:28,180
There. Nobody's getting
through that sucker.

1251
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:30,550
But we have to get down
to the cellar.

1252
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:34,080
- George.
- Cindy.

1253
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,590
There's no time.

1254
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:36,990
Cody.

1255
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:39,030
Thank God.
I've been worried sick.

1256
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:41,660
He showed up about an hour ago.
I tried to call.

1257
01:00:41,730 --> 01:00:43,390
No he didn't.

1258
01:00:43,470 --> 01:00:45,490
Okay but I was gonna.

1259
01:00:45,570 --> 01:00:47,330
No he wasn't.

1260
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:50,860
Cody the point is you can't
just run away like that.

1261
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:52,880
I wanted to be with George.

1262
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:55,640
Oh honey I know
you want a dad but...

1263
01:00:55,710 --> 01:00:58,740
Oh trust me Cody
I'm not good at anything.

1264
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:00,220
Why would I be good at that?

1265
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:02,580
SUE:
Uncle George!

1266
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:17,460
It's gonna be okay Cody.

1267
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:19,940
I'm going to die aren't I?

1268
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,770
Cody did I ever tell you
what your mom said

1269
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:24,930
about you
the day you were born?

1270
01:01:25,010 --> 01:01:26,030
No.

1271
01:01:26,110 --> 01:01:28,510
I was in the delivery room
with her.

1272
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:30,410
She was having a hard time.

1273
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,110
Then you began
to come out of her.

1274
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:35,350
And your mom screamed
and screamed in pain.

1275
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:37,180
She yelled "Just kill me.

1276
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:38,850
Bludgeon me with a bedpan.

1277
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:41,620
Whatever you do
put me out of this pain."

1278
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:43,850
She was gushing
torrents of blood.

1279
01:01:43,930 --> 01:01:46,660
I have this all on tape
if you want to see it someday.

1280
01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:48,630
Well finally you came out.

1281
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:51,500
Your mom cut
your umbilical cord herself.

1282
01:01:51,570 --> 01:01:54,500
Well on the second try.

1283
01:01:54,570 --> 01:01:57,340
The first time she snipped
your penis in half.

1284
01:01:57,410 --> 01:01:58,900
After all she was drunk.

1285
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:00,470
Actually drugged.

1286
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:03,510
We'd been out the night before
celebrating St. Patrick's Day.

1287
01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:05,810
She thought "Hey
I never tasted crystal meth."

1288
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:07,820
So she did just a little.

1289
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:09,080
My penis?

1290
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:10,020
Yes.

1291
01:02:10,090 --> 01:02:12,580
They sewed it on upside down.

1292
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:14,450
So that's why I pee up?

1293
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:15,990
Yes.
We'll get it fixed honey.

1294
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:18,960
It's on my list of things.
Right after we get TiVo.

1295
01:02:19,030 --> 01:02:20,830
Anyway there you were.

1296
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:22,490
Your mom turned to me and said

1297
01:02:22,570 --> 01:02:25,500
"Hey you want him?
Take him."

1298
01:02:25,570 --> 01:02:27,330
Then she died.

1299
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:28,840
And I took you.

1300
01:02:28,910 --> 01:02:31,100
Do you know why?

1301
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:32,840
I had just lost my cat
in a fire

1302
01:02:32,910 --> 01:02:34,780
and I needed something
to pet and feed.

1303
01:02:34,850 --> 01:02:37,680
And I miss that cat Cody.

1304
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:39,240
But I love you.

1305
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:41,480
And nothing's
ever gonna change that

1306
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:44,180
not even the very painful death
we're about to experience.

1307
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:45,720
TOM:
George!

1308
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:49,090
[Banging]

1309
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,020
Are they gone?

1310
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:56,290
I don't hear anything.

1311
01:02:56,370 --> 01:02:57,460
[Banging]

1312
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,300
[Screams effeminately]

1313
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:05,640
Don't worry Sue.

1314
01:03:05,710 --> 01:03:06,970
SUE:
It was Uncle George.

1315
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:09,640
Well it's scary.

1316
01:03:11,050 --> 01:03:13,310
Good work Sue.

1317
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:15,650
I don't know what stupid
idiotic thing

1318
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:17,710
made these lights go off.

1319
01:03:17,790 --> 01:03:20,310
All right there's spare fuses
in the crawl space.

1320
01:03:20,390 --> 01:03:21,920
I can get these lights back on.

1321
01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:23,260
[Banging]

1322
01:03:23,330 --> 01:03:25,820
Quick George
grab that railroad tie.

1323
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:27,590
Jam it against the door.

1324
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,230
- Oh!
- [Gasps]

1325
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:31,500
My balls!

1326
01:03:31,570 --> 01:03:33,660
Oh!
Not those!

1327
01:03:33,740 --> 01:03:35,330
Jesus!

1328
01:03:35,410 --> 01:03:36,700
No!

1329
01:03:37,810 --> 01:03:38,780
SUE:
Uncle George!

1330
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:40,170
I'm scared!

1331
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:43,040
Oh sweetie come here.
It's okay.

1332
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:44,740
Aah!

1333
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:47,910
There's something
on the other side of the door.

1334
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:03,320
I can't see anything.

1335
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:20,240
Oh my God.

1336
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:21,750
Can you see them?

1337
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:23,550
They're horrible.

1338
01:04:23,620 --> 01:04:25,710
They're grayish
with big black eyes.

1339
01:04:25,790 --> 01:04:27,550
Their teeth are grotesque.

1340
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:29,250
[Trilling]

1341
01:04:29,330 --> 01:04:32,630
- I think they're giggling.
- What?

1342
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:34,430
Oh no.

1343
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:36,990
Oh no I think...

1344
01:04:37,070 --> 01:04:39,660
- I think they want...
- [Banging]

1345
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:42,830
Aaah!
Help!

1346
01:04:42,910 --> 01:04:44,570
Cody!
Oh my God!

1347
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:46,940
George.
Swing away George.

1348
01:04:47,010 --> 01:04:48,910
- Aah! Aunt Cindy help!
- I'm coming Cody.

1349
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:50,170
I'll save you.

1350
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:51,980
- Ugh!
- Die!

1351
01:04:55,150 --> 01:04:56,080
Die!

1352
01:04:56,150 --> 01:04:58,280
You damn aliens let him go!

1353
01:04:58,360 --> 01:04:59,950
You're not getting in here!

1354
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:01,920
- What else you got?
- George.

1355
01:05:01,990 --> 01:05:04,090
There!
Had enough?

1356
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:06,790
Yeah. Forget it Cody.
Thank me later.

1357
01:05:06,860 --> 01:05:08,630
Oh Cody.
Oh thank God.

1358
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:09,630
Come on.

1359
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:10,790
SUE:
Daddy!

1360
01:05:10,870 --> 01:05:12,100
- Daddy!
- Sue!

1361
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:16,470
Oh!

1362
01:05:16,540 --> 01:05:18,630
Mahalik
what are you doing here?

1363
01:05:18,710 --> 01:05:20,870
I told you the hood's
always got your back.

1364
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:23,940
Thank God.
There's two of them at the door.

1365
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:24,980
They're gone.

1366
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:28,380
Good.
They couldn't get in.

1367
01:05:28,450 --> 01:05:29,890
I hear they can't open doors.

1368
01:05:29,950 --> 01:05:31,650
They mastered space flight

1369
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:33,620
but they can't get
through a wooden door?

1370
01:05:33,690 --> 01:05:35,820
Oh look the cellar's
the safest place.

1371
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:37,720
Women and children stay here.

1372
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:39,850
- Ugh!
- All right and the men

1373
01:05:39,930 --> 01:05:41,300
we go outside and fight.

1374
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:44,030
Right. And what's
the cutoff age for children?

1375
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:45,500
Come on!

I'm sorry.

1381
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:18,900
I thought
I was hitting the brake.

1382
01:06:18,970 --> 01:06:21,910
Now we don't have to go
through insurance do we?

1383
01:06:21,970 --> 01:06:24,070
Mr. President
what are you doing here?

1384
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:25,510
I'm looking for Cindy Campbell.

1385
01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:28,040
She may hold the key
to defeating the aliens.

1386
01:06:28,110 --> 01:06:32,240
Ah good. The Air Force is here
with those new round planes.

1387
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:36,250
We don't have round planes sir.

1388
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:37,910
Oh my God.

1389
01:06:37,990 --> 01:06:39,460

1410
01:07:24,470 --> 01:07:25,730
I got nuts bigger than him.

1411
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:28,670
Whoa country-ass
maple-syrup nigga.

1412
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:32,180
Yeah you want some biscuits?
You want some biscuits?

1413
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:35,640
Get down!
Get down!

1414
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:45,520
I can't believe what I just saw.

1415
01:07:45,590 --> 01:07:47,320
These men died
for their country.

1416
01:07:47,390 --> 01:07:50,660
Send flowers
to their bitches and hos.

1417
01:07:55,100 --> 01:07:57,160
I can't break free!

1418
01:07:57,230 --> 01:08:01,030
Think! They must have
some kind of weakness.

1419
01:08:04,710 --> 01:08:05,470
- Huh?
- Huh?

1420
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:06,740
I found it!

1421
01:08:06,810 --> 01:08:08,780
Without their heads
they're powerless!

1422
01:08:08,850 --> 01:08:10,780
Please no.
We mean you no harm.

1423
01:08:10,850 --> 01:08:13,610
We traveled to your planet
to find an evil little girl.

1424
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:17,210
We must destroy her
before seven days.

1425
01:08:17,290 --> 01:08:19,650
You mean you watched
the videotape?

1426
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:22,210
Our satellite picked up what
we thought was "Pootie Tang."

1427
01:08:22,290 --> 01:08:23,780
That was a week ago.

1428
01:08:23,860 --> 01:08:28,960
And now our entire race will die
unless the girl is destroyed.

1429
01:08:29,030 --> 01:08:32,000
Oh see?
They are peaceful.

1430
01:08:32,070 --> 01:08:35,300
If they're so peaceful
why were they choking us?

1431
01:08:35,370 --> 01:08:38,000
Oh that's how we say hello.

1432
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,470
- Hello!
- Nice to see you.

1433
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:41,530
- Hello.
- Hello.

1434
01:08:41,610 --> 01:08:43,580
Well how do you guys
say goodbye?

1435
01:08:43,650 --> 01:08:44,880
Oh!

1436
01:08:44,950 --> 01:08:47,510
[Groans]
I had to ask.

1437
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:52,550
If you think that's strange
you should see how we pee.

1438
01:08:52,620 --> 01:08:55,150
[Choking]

1439
01:08:58,430 --> 01:09:01,800
So we're not so different
after all.

1440
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:06,440
There's something
about this place.

1441
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:09,130
It's like I've seen it before.

1442
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:12,980
Oh my God.

1443
01:09:16,450 --> 01:09:18,470
This used to be their farm.

1444
01:09:18,550 --> 01:09:20,350
She died right here.

1445
01:09:34,830 --> 01:09:37,200
There's something down there.

1446
01:09:48,010 --> 01:09:49,570
Ugh!

1447
01:10:01,390 --> 01:10:04,880
Hey awesome.
Yeah you got it.

1448
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:06,160
Just look at this.

1449
01:10:06,230 --> 01:10:09,530
Human beings and aliens
working together.

1450
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:13,060
We're all just
one big galactic family.

1451
01:10:13,140 --> 01:10:14,900
Family.

1452
01:10:14,970 --> 01:10:17,170
That's just what
I've been running away from.

1453
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:20,340
Well that's because
you're an idiot.

1454
01:10:30,290 --> 01:10:32,220
This is it.

1455
01:10:32,290 --> 01:10:34,450
ARCHITECT: My wife took her
to the family farm

1456
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:36,650
and drowned her in the well.

1457
01:10:40,030 --> 01:10:44,930
The little girl.
She's frightened of the well.

1458
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:49,660
[Gasps]

1459
01:11:02,850 --> 01:11:04,010
Aah!

1460
01:11:04,090 --> 01:11:06,610
- Ugh!
- Cindy!

1461
01:11:09,130 --> 01:11:11,060
[Crowbar clanks]

1462
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:23,240
[Chainsaw sputters buzzes]

1463
01:11:43,930 --> 01:11:46,020
Time to go back
down the well bitch.

1464
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:48,660
[Growling]

1465
01:11:48,730 --> 01:11:49,660
Cindy!

1466
01:11:49,730 --> 01:11:52,500
No.
Don't hurt him!

1467
01:11:53,470 --> 01:11:54,960
Cindy come outside.

1468
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:56,600
- The aliens aren't invading.
- Aah!

1469
01:11:56,670 --> 01:11:58,230
Aah!

1470
01:11:58,310 --> 01:12:00,040
Don't worry Cody.
I'll save you.

1471
01:12:00,110 --> 01:12:01,700
- Aah!
- CIND Y: Wait!

1472
01:12:01,780 --> 01:12:04,010
Wait.
Don't do this.

1473
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:06,380
You don't have to be evil.

1474
01:12:07,350 --> 01:12:10,950
I know what happened
to you Tabitha.

1475
01:12:12,190 --> 01:12:15,090
I know what your mom did.
That was wrong.

1476
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:16,850
You were just a little girl.

1477
01:12:16,930 --> 01:12:20,890
You're still that little girl
just a lot more corpsy

1478
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:23,400
and with really bad teeth.

1479
01:12:23,470 --> 01:12:27,560
But maybe all you need
is a mother.

1480
01:12:31,210 --> 01:12:33,110
And a father.

1481
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:47,090
We could be...

1482
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:49,180
A family.

1483
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:55,530
Thank you all.

1484
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:59,040
Your love has broken the curse
and freed my soul.

1485
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:00,830
I'll never have to kill again.

1486
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:02,570
Really?

1487
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:06,230
Nah!
I'm just screwing with you!

1488
01:13:06,310 --> 01:13:08,570
[Grunts]
Aah!

1489
01:13:08,650 --> 01:13:10,640
I just want to tell you both
good luck.

1490
01:13:10,710 --> 01:13:12,440
- We're all counting on you.
- [Splash]

1491
01:13:21,590 --> 01:13:22,920
Now it's over.

1492
01:13:22,990 --> 01:13:24,190
- [Gasps]
- Aah!

1493
01:13:24,260 --> 01:13:25,850
Oh no no it's okay.

1494
01:13:25,930 --> 01:13:27,490
He's our friend.

1495
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:29,530
Thank you for saving
our species.

1496
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:31,530
Now we must return
to our home planet.

1497
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:32,830
Goodbye then.

1498
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:33,840
Ugh!

1499
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:35,460
Goodbye.

1500
01:13:54,220 --> 01:13:56,690
Hey congratulations George!

1501

Oh George I'm so happy.

1509
