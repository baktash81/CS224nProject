1
00:00:35,407 --> 00:00:40,640
# I know I am, I'm sure I am
I'm West Ham till I die #

2
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:43,799
[shouting]

3
00:00:45,487 --> 00:00:48,240
Go on, bruv. Go on, bruv.

4
00:00:53,247 --> 00:00:59,436
Fuck me. If I knew we was going to a bar
mitzvah, I'd have brought me fucking skullcap.

5
00:00:59,607 --> 00:01:04,556
Mate, Tottenham's due north.
Are you lost or just fucking stupid?

6
00:01:04,727 --> 00:01:08,436
Still a stand-up comedian, eh, Dunham?
All right, mate.

7
00:01:08,607 --> 00:01:11,917
When the Major was doing your job,
he wasn't nearly so chatty.

8
00:01:12,087 --> 00:01:15,045
Probably 'cause
he wasn't quite so nervous either.

9
00:01:15,207 --> 00:01:18,438
The Major always preferred a scrap
to your yammer.

10
00:01:18,607 --> 00:01:20,916
- What's all that? What is that?
- Yammer?

11
00:01:21,087 --> 00:01:26,445
You reckon? Mate, I think you should get
on the next train and fuck off out of here.

12
00:01:26,607 --> 00:01:29,724
- Before something bad happens.
- [Jeering]

13
00:01:29,887 --> 00:01:32,401
We'd be interested to see exactly what that is.

14
00:01:32,567 --> 00:01:35,604
You're not exactly top-flight mob
these days, are you?

15
00:01:35,767 --> 00:01:38,201
- More like a two-bob mob.
- [Laughter]

16
00:01:38,367 --> 00:01:40,961
See, now, that's just plain rude.

17
00:01:41,127 --> 00:01:44,483
But if you fancy it, who are we to let you down?

18
00:01:44,647 --> 00:01:49,641
- Come on, then!
- Come on, then, you fucking poncey cunt!

19
00:01:49,807 --> 00:01:53,277
- You fucking cunt! You!
- [Chanting]

20
00:02:08,607 --> 00:02:10,279
Fucking have it! Come on.

21
00:03:05,647 --> 00:03:07,638
Let's go.

22
00:03:08,727 --> 00:03:11,082
I'm telling you, you don't need Lewis.

23
00:03:11,247 --> 00:03:18,005
I will trade you Keeshon and Maddux for Lewis.
And I'm gonna be losing out on this deal.

24
00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:22,797
Because Keeshon, he's back
with the old coach. He's back with Parcells.

25
00:03:22,967 --> 00:03:25,686
And they are gonna be an unstoppable team.

26
00:03:25,847 --> 00:03:28,236
You know that. I know that.

27
00:03:30,647 --> 00:03:34,196
Look, man, he was
comeback player of the year, you know.

28
00:03:34,367 --> 00:03:39,077
Not many guys have thrown
over 6,000 yards. Come on.

29
00:03:42,487 --> 00:03:45,684
Let me call you back.
I gotta deal with something.

30
00:03:48,327 --> 00:03:53,720
Buckner. That $10,000.
I think it's a pretty good deal.

31
00:03:53,887 --> 00:03:56,606
We never had a deal, Jeremy.

32
00:03:59,847 --> 00:04:02,520
Look, I know you got screwed here.

33
00:04:02,687 --> 00:04:06,316
But I have my family's reputation to protect.

34
00:04:06,487 --> 00:04:10,924
A Van Holden getting expelled from Harvard.
No way.

35
00:04:11,087 --> 00:04:13,476
I've got a little more at stake here, Matt.

36
00:04:14,527 --> 00:04:16,836
Buckner.

37
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:19,077
Come on, man.

38
00:04:19,247 --> 00:04:25,004
My dad is definitely gonna get re-elected.
When I graduate, I'll totally hook you up.

39
00:04:28,207 --> 00:04:30,198
Thanks, bro.

40
00:04:37,607 --> 00:04:39,996
You're really saving my ass.

41
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:16,283
You've reached Carl Buckner. I'm currently
on assignment in Kabul and I'm unreachable.

42
00:05:16,447 --> 00:05:18,597
Leave a message
at the foreign correspondents desk

43
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:23,557
at the Washington bureau of the Times
and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.

44
00:05:23,727 --> 00:05:25,718
Thanks so much.

45
00:06:04,727 --> 00:06:08,163
This is a security announcement
at Heathrow airport.

46
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:12,525
Please keep your belongings with you
at all times.

47
00:06:12,687 --> 00:06:14,678
[Matt] My name is Matt Buckner.

48
00:06:14,847 --> 00:06:18,681
Last spring, I got kicked out of Harvard
two months shy of my diploma,

49
00:06:18,847 --> 00:06:23,318
but what I was about to learn, no lvy League
school in the world could teach me.

50
00:07:44,727 --> 00:07:49,562
Mind the gap.
Please stand clear of the closing doors.

51
00:07:49,727 --> 00:07:52,685
Mind the gap. Please stand clear.

52
00:08:10,007 --> 00:08:12,157
[Woman] Matt!

53
00:08:14,887 --> 00:08:17,003
- Hi. Hey.
- Hey.

54
00:08:17,167 --> 00:08:19,556
- Oh, my God.
- It's so good to see you.

55
00:08:19,727 --> 00:08:22,924
You, too. Was that a terrorist attack?
What happened here?

56
00:08:23,087 --> 00:08:26,397
Welcome to match-day madness.
Tottenham was in town last night.

57
00:08:26,567 --> 00:08:30,037
- Are you a soccer fan now?
- Don't let them hear you say soccer.

58
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:32,641
- Who's "them"?
- The British Empire.

59
00:08:33,687 --> 00:08:36,326
Uncle Matt, meet Ben.

60
00:08:36,487 --> 00:08:39,047
- Can you believe that?
- Hey there, little guy.

61
00:08:39,207 --> 00:08:41,516
- He's adorable.
- Yeah.

62
00:08:42,767 --> 00:08:46,726
It is so good to see you.
But what are you doing here?

63
00:08:51,327 --> 00:08:57,357
It doesn't make sense. Why would you have
been expelled if you didn't do anything wrong?

64
00:08:57,527 --> 00:09:00,280
It was my roommate. He's a total cokehead.

65
00:09:00,447 --> 00:09:04,599
Somebody tipped off campus security
and we got our room searched.

66
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,758
They found his stash in my stuff.

67
00:09:06,927 --> 00:09:10,840
I guess he'd been hiding his shit
in my closet the entire time.

68
00:09:11,007 --> 00:09:13,475
Really?

69
00:09:13,647 --> 00:09:17,606
- Yeah, really.
- You could tell me if you were taking...

70
00:09:17,767 --> 00:09:22,158
- It's not like that.
- So you fought it and they didn't believe you?

71
00:09:22,327 --> 00:09:25,876
Matt. You fought it, right?

72
00:09:26,927 --> 00:09:29,487
Look, you don't know who this guy is.

73
00:09:29,647 --> 00:09:31,683
He's a Van Holden.

74
00:09:31,847 --> 00:09:34,839
I wouldn't have even had a chance.

75
00:09:36,207 --> 00:09:38,801
So what did Dad say?

76
00:09:38,967 --> 00:09:40,446
"You've reached Carl Buckner."

77
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:43,519
"I'll be in the lvory Coast for 57 years"?

78
00:09:43,687 --> 00:09:46,326
- Kabul this time.
- Whatever.

79
00:09:46,487 --> 00:09:50,241
Seriously, though, when you spoke to him,
what did he say?

80
00:09:50,407 --> 00:09:53,285
- I didn't tell him.
- He doesn't know?

81
00:09:55,007 --> 00:09:59,683
- I probably would have done the same thing.
- Yeah?

82
00:09:59,847 --> 00:10:03,078
Once he finds out his golden boy
got kicked out of Harvard,

83
00:10:03,247 --> 00:10:05,636
he'll dive headfirst
into an empty swimming pool.

84
00:10:05,807 --> 00:10:08,037
- Gee, thanks.
- [Car door closes]

85
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:11,836
Oh, Steve's home.

86
00:10:12,007 --> 00:10:13,998
- Hi, baby.
- Hey.

87
00:10:16,807 --> 00:10:21,005
- I've got a surprise for you.
- Oh, honey, we have a guest.

88
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:24,125
This is my kid brother, Matt.

89
00:10:24,287 --> 00:10:26,721
Matt. All right, mate? How are you doing?

90
00:10:26,887 --> 00:10:31,005
- It's good to finally meet you.
- And you. Finally made it across the pond?

91
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:33,158
- Yeah.
- [Baby gurgles]

92
00:10:33,327 --> 00:10:35,795
Who's this? Who's this?

93
00:10:35,967 --> 00:10:38,356
Come here. Oh, I missed you. Come here.

94
00:10:38,527 --> 00:10:40,438
Oh!

95
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:44,316
- I missed you, little Lord Ben.
- Honey, you want some tea?

96
00:10:44,487 --> 00:10:46,523
- Yeah, that'd be great.
- Tea, huh?

97
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:50,202
- Get over it.
- He's a good-looking little geezer, in't he?

98
00:10:50,367 --> 00:10:52,403
- Sure is.
- Listen, Matt.

99
00:10:52,567 --> 00:10:56,037
I'm really pleased you're here,
but I made some plans for tonight.

100
00:10:56,207 --> 00:10:58,323
I've got this whole romantic evening set up.

101
00:10:58,487 --> 00:11:01,763
I've got the babysitter booked,
and we've got tickets to see Chicago.

102
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:03,918
- You wouldn't mind if we go?
- [Knocking]

103
00:11:04,087 --> 00:11:06,601
Oh, excuse me.

104
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:11,682
Shall we go and see who's banging
the door down? What a surprise.

105
00:11:11,847 --> 00:11:15,157
- What are you doing?
- Aye aye! All right, bruv.

106
00:11:18,327 --> 00:11:21,956
- Jesus, Shannon, you look rough.
- You're a funny guy, Pete.

107
00:11:22,127 --> 00:11:25,403
- [Pete laughs]
- Matt, this is Pete, Steve's brother.

108
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:28,161
- Pete, this is my brother, Matt.
- Hi.

109
00:11:28,327 --> 00:11:31,444
- All right, son?
- Good to meet you.

110
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:32,835
Hello, Ben.

111
00:11:33,007 --> 00:11:36,795
# I'm West Ham till I die
I'm West Ham till I die

112
00:11:36,967 --> 00:11:39,845
- # I know I am, I'm sure I am... #
- All right.

113
00:11:40,007 --> 00:11:43,841
- I'm taking him to bed.
- All right, babe.

114
00:11:45,127 --> 00:11:47,357
- See you later, Ben.
- Well done.

115
00:11:47,527 --> 00:11:50,997
- I thought you were going to the match.
- Well, technically, yes.

116
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:54,762
But we got into a bit of a drinking session
last night.

117
00:11:54,927 --> 00:11:58,078
- One thing led to another...
- You've lost your wallet.

118
00:11:58,247 --> 00:12:00,044
- And me keys.
- [Horn beeps]

119
00:12:00,207 --> 00:12:03,483
There's a taxi outside.

120
00:12:05,007 --> 00:12:07,919
Top bloke, my brother.

121
00:12:08,087 --> 00:12:09,406
So...

122
00:12:12,407 --> 00:12:14,967
How are we, my colonial cousin?

123
00:12:15,687 --> 00:12:18,918
- Fine, thanks.
- [American accent] Fine, thanks.

124
00:12:20,847 --> 00:12:23,919
- You couldn't make it a hundred?
- How does piss off sound?

125
00:12:24,087 --> 00:12:25,884
Fuck off, come on.

126
00:12:26,047 --> 00:12:29,164
# Get some drinks in
Get some drinks in

127
00:12:29,327 --> 00:12:33,002
- # Get... #
- Shut up. Just shut up.

128
00:12:34,007 --> 00:12:37,124
I'll tell you what I'll do, all right?

129
00:12:37,287 --> 00:12:40,563
I'll give you a hundred...

130
00:12:42,527 --> 00:12:44,916
...if you take Matt here to the match.

131
00:12:45,087 --> 00:12:48,124
Fuck off, you're having a bubble.

132
00:12:48,287 --> 00:12:51,882
- I can't take a Yank to football.
- Yeah, you can.

133
00:12:52,047 --> 00:12:55,642
And you're gonna be on your best behaviour,
do you understand?

134
00:12:59,527 --> 00:13:02,564
- Go on.
- Well, come on, then.

135
00:13:02,727 --> 00:13:06,322
Cheers, Matt.
We don't get much time on our own.

136
00:13:06,487 --> 00:13:10,878
Right, listen to me.
You don't give him the money, OK?

137
00:13:11,047 --> 00:13:13,322
No way. That's beer for the boys.

138
00:13:13,487 --> 00:13:16,240
- All right.
- All right?

139
00:13:16,407 --> 00:13:18,841
Matt? Where are you going?

140
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:21,805
I'm going to the soccer game with Pete.

141
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:25,880
- But you just got here.
- I know, but I'll catch up with you later.

142
00:13:26,047 --> 00:13:29,357
- Have a good time. See you.
- [Pete] Hurry up.

143
00:13:29,527 --> 00:13:32,599
I don't want him hanging out
with Pete and those thugs.

144
00:13:32,767 --> 00:13:35,964
It's all right. He's a big boy.
He can look after himself.

145
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,766
Pick a hand. Come on.

146
00:13:41,727 --> 00:13:44,799
The right hand?
You've just won the star prize.

147
00:13:49,407 --> 00:13:53,400
Yeah? How much do you love me?

148
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:55,478
- A lot.
- That's not enough.

149
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:07,599
I'm not being funny, but the last thing
I want to do is to take you to the match.

150
00:14:07,767 --> 00:14:12,318
So here's how it works.
Give me half the money. I'll go to football.

151
00:14:12,487 --> 00:14:17,845
You can see where Churchill took a tom,
or whatever you Yanks do in Jolly Old.

152
00:14:18,007 --> 00:14:22,319
- Tom?
- Tom. A tomtit, shit.

153
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:26,082
It's rhyming slang.
Like bees and honey for money.

154
00:14:26,247 --> 00:14:29,683
Like I could say to you,
give me the fucking bees.

155
00:14:29,847 --> 00:14:35,319
- I made a promise to Steve.
- Well, Steve ain't here, is he, mate? I am.

156
00:14:35,487 --> 00:14:38,763
You're pissing in the wind
if you think I'm taking you.

157
00:14:38,927 --> 00:14:43,443
- I'm not giving you the money.
- You ain't really got a fucking choice, mate.

158
00:14:43,607 --> 00:14:47,600
And you're starting to get on my tits.
Give me half the money.

159
00:14:49,487 --> 00:14:51,478
Cops!

160
00:14:53,127 --> 00:14:55,766
Well, how fucking stupid do you feel now?

161
00:14:55,927 --> 00:14:59,158
Come on, then, dance for me, Yankee.

162
00:15:02,207 --> 00:15:05,165
Serves you right

So, I'm guessing you're not much of a fighter.

167
00:15:18,607 --> 00:15:21,121
Fighter? That's probably
the first fight I ever had.

168
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:24,245
You call that a fight?

169
00:15:25,887 --> 00:15:30,039

- No, mate. Not about soccer.

- Where's Bovver?
- He's been in the toilet for 15 minutes.

205

- Dodgy Ruby or something.
- Look, he looks lost.

As for the Yank, he's too modest to tell you,

ranked double black belt in karate.

00:27:16,567 --> 00:27:19,161
- What you heard?
- The usual. Fucking Zulus.

330
00:27:19,327 --> 00:27:23,639
They're mobbing up on the Tube right now.
It's gonna kick off near East Ham.

331
00:27:23,807 --> 00:27:27,846
- Time to go, then, boys.
- What are we standing here for?

332
00:27:28,007 --> 00:27:30,646
- Let's get 'em.
- Maybe I should head home.

333
00:27:30,807 --> 00:27:33,162
- You know where you're going?
- Bank station, right?

334
00:27:33,327 --> 00:27:36,603
Yeah. Keep your head down.
Birmingham lot will be on the Tube.

335
00:27:36,767 --> 00:27:39,600
- I'll manage.
- Wouldn't he be better in a crèche?

336
00:27:39,767 --> 00:27:43,521
Don't get on at East Ham.
Any trouble, just walk the other way.

337
00:27:43,687 --> 00:27:46,406
- Don't worry.
- [Pete] Let's go, eh?

338
00:28:03,487 --> 00:28:05,364
Get him!

339
00:28:14,927 --> 00:28:17,805
- Look, I don't want any trouble!
- A fucking Yank.

340
00:28:17,967 --> 00:28:21,721
- Why's a Yank running with the GSE?
- I don't know anything about the GSE.

341
00:28:21,887 --> 00:28:27,120
- I'm just a tourist.
- How about we leave you with a souvenir?

342
00:28:27,287 --> 00:28:30,245
- Ever heard of a Chelsea grin, huh?
- Come on, please!

343
00:28:30,407 --> 00:28:33,126
Do you take American Express?

344
00:28:37,927 --> 00:28:41,522
I bet the Major gave out
his share of Chelsea grins,

345
00:28:41,687 --> 00:28:45,760
back when the GSE weren't so sloppy
to leave one of their own behind.

346
00:28:45,927 --> 00:28:48,395
We don't leave our mates behind.

347
00:28:57,407 --> 00:29:00,365
- You horrible bastard.
- Look, he's getting away! Let's go!

348
00:29:00,527 --> 00:29:02,722
- Down this side.
- I'll get the van.

349
00:29:06,847 --> 00:29:09,566
- Where the fuck's he gone?
- Where the fuck is he?

350
00:29:09,727 --> 00:29:14,642
I'm getting too old for this shit.
Seriously, I could use a beer and a lie-down.

351
00:29:14,807 --> 00:29:17,765
- [Horn beeps]
- Oh, here he is.

352
00:29:20,927 --> 00:29:24,317
- Get it out of first.
- Can't get it out your mum.

353
00:29:24,487 --> 00:29:27,559
- She has to be financed.
- Come on, back to the Abbey.

354
00:29:27,727 --> 00:29:32,039
- Whose round is it?
- Whose round do you think it is?

355
00:29:32,207 --> 00:29:34,801
- [Ned] It's not my round.
- Oh, shut up moaning.

356
00:29:34,967 --> 00:29:37,435
It stinks.

357
00:29:38,887 --> 00:29:41,560
- Fuck off!
- Come on, boys. Let's fucking have him!

358
00:29:41,727 --> 00:29:43,957
Let's have the little cunt!

359
00:29:44,127 --> 00:29:47,836
- Zulu! Zulu! Zulu! Zulu! Zulu!
- What the fuck's that?

360
00:29:50,447 --> 00:29:55,043
Well, come on, then! What you fucking
standing there for, you cunts?

361
00:29:55,207 --> 00:29:57,641
Oh, here we go.

362
00:29:58,647 --> 00:30:00,638
- Let's get out of here!
- What?

363
00:30:00,807 --> 00:30:03,640
- There's 20 guys!
- You don't run when you're with us.

364
00:30:03,807 --> 00:30:06,560
- You stand your ground and fight.
- I don't know how.

365
00:30:06,727 --> 00:30:10,197
Just think of someone you hate.
Come on, then!

366
00:30:18,887 --> 00:30:22,197
Get up, you fucking twat! Come on!

367
00:30:38,687 --> 00:30:41,121
Ah, you fucking... Get off!

368
00:30:51,927 --> 00:30:53,645
[Chanting]

369
00:30:53,807 --> 00:30:55,638
Come on!

370
00:31:12,727 --> 00:31:16,037
Come on! Come on! Come on!

371
00:31:22,287 --> 00:31:25,245
- Fuck me!
- What do you make of that, then?

372
00:31:25,407 --> 00:31:31,243
- What a fucking result!
- You were a fucking maniac, Matt.

373
00:31:31,407 --> 00:31:35,161
Fair play, son. There's plenty
who would've bottled it and done a runner.

374
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:38,399
- Good for you. I'm proud of you.
- Who was he, then?

375
00:31:38,567 --> 00:31:41,445
- Who?
- The geezer you was just fighting.

376
00:31:41,607 --> 00:31:44,519
- Jeremy Van fucking Holden.
- You done yourself proud, mate.

377
00:31:44,687 --> 00:31:49,477
Now we've all stopped kissing each other's
arses, see the first punch he threw?

378
00:31:49,647 --> 00:31:51,763
- On the feminine side.
- A bit gay.

379
00:31:51,927 --> 00:31:54,521
- Little bit Larry Grayson.
- Come on.

380
00:31:55,407 --> 00:31:59,002
- Come on, yous all wanna get pinched?
- Let's push him out.

381
00:32:00,087 --> 00:32:02,078
[Police sirens]

382
00:32:17,407 --> 00:32:20,365
Morning, sunshine. How do you feel?

383
00:32:20,527 --> 00:32:22,916
Oh, a little sore.

384
00:32:24,767 --> 00:32:28,840
English breakfast, double dose of aspirin,
you'll feel sweet as a nut, mate.

385
00:32:29,007 --> 00:32:33,205
- Yeah.
- I gotta piss like a racehorse.

386
00:32:35,847 --> 00:32:37,963
Fucking journos. Look at this.

387
00:32:38,127 --> 00:32:41,244
West Ham wins three nil
in a blinding performance

388
00:32:41,407 --> 00:32:43,363
and our little scrap makes the headline.

389
00:32:43,527 --> 00:32:47,440
- Bloody muckrakers.
- So, what is this?

390
00:32:47,607 --> 00:32:49,598
Bollocks journo bullshit.

391
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:53,362
- No, no, this. The GSE.
- Shh! Lower it, son.

392
00:32:54,127 --> 00:32:57,403
Are you guys like an organised
political movement or something?

393
00:32:57,567 --> 00:33:02,118
No, mate. We're a firm.
You never heard of a firm in the States?

394
00:33:02,287 --> 00:33:06,485
- No.
- Every football team in Europe's got a firm.

395
00:33:06,647 --> 00:33:11,323
Some have two.
Christ, I forgot how clueless you Yanks are.

396
00:33:11,487 --> 00:33:15,275
All you've seen of us
are the stadium riots on TV. Come on.

397
00:33:15,447 --> 00:33:17,642
[Woman] Two bacon sarnies.

398
00:33:17,807 --> 00:33:23,120
See, West Ham football's mediocre, but
our firm is top notch and everyone knows it.

399
00:33:23,287 --> 00:33:26,279
The GSE. Green Street Elite.

400
00:33:26,447 --> 00:33:30,963
Arsenal: Great football, shit firm. The Gooners.

401
00:33:31,127 --> 00:33:36,201
Tottenham: Shit football and a shit firm.
The Yids, they're called.

402
00:33:36,367 --> 00:33:39,518
I put their main lad
through a phone-box window.

403
00:33:39,687 --> 00:33:42,281
- What about Millwall?
- Ah, Millwall.

404
00:33:42,447 --> 00:33:45,723
Where to even fucking begin with Millwall?

405
00:33:45,887 --> 00:33:49,323
Millwall and West Ham firms hate each other
more than any other firms.

406
00:33:49,487 --> 00:33:53,844
- Sort of like the Yankees and the Red Sox.
- More like the Israelis and the Palestinians.

407
00:33:54,007 --> 00:33:56,396
We haven't played Millwall in ten years.

408
00:33:56,567 --> 00:34:00,355
Their top boy's this geezer
named Tommy Hatcher. Horrible old cunt.

409
00:34:00,527 --> 00:34:03,758
Back in the Major's day,
Tommy's son was killed in a scrap.

410
00:34:03,927 --> 00:34:08,125
After that, he went completely mental,
lost the plot.

411
00:34:08,287 --> 00:34:13,077
- Who's the Major?
- Ah, the Major. Quite a legend round here.

412
00:34:13,247 --> 00:34:16,478
He ran the GSE in the '90s
when I was coming up.

413
00:34:16,647 --> 00:34:20,879
Hardest bastard you ever saw.
They say we kind of lost our way when he left.

414
00:34:21,047 --> 00:34:26,167
But believe me, my boys are bringing
the old GSE reputation right back.

415
00:34:26,327 --> 00:34:29,160
So, basically, firms are gangs.

416
00:34:29,327 --> 00:34:33,081
Kind of. But we're a far cry
from all that Bloods and Crips bullshit.

417
00:34:33,247 --> 00:34:39,083
Shooting a machine-gun out of a moving car
at an eight-year-old girl, that's just cowardly.

418
00:34:39,247 --> 00:34:43,525
See, we might be into fighting and all that,
but it's really about reputation.

419
00:34:43,687 --> 00:34:46,121
Humiliating another mob in a row

420
00:34:46,287 --> 00:34:49,484
or doing something the other firms
get to hear or talk about.

421
00:34:49,647 --> 00:34:54,641
Like a Yank in his first fight
battering one of Birmingham's main lads.

422
00:34:56,247 --> 00:34:59,842
- Here you are, love, sit down.
- Thank you.

423
00:35:00,007 --> 00:35:03,204
I don't know how to thank you
for what you did.

424
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:06,723
Don't give it another thought.
Yesterday was a good result for us.

425
00:35:06,887 --> 00:35:10,436
We had a laugh, a few pints,
cheered on the mighty Hammers.

426
00:35:10,607 --> 00:35:12,882
We was completely outnumbered,

427
00:35:13,047 --> 00:35:16,881
but we stuck by our mates
and we stood our ground, no matter what.

428
00:35:17,047 --> 00:35:20,164
That's what it's all about.

429
00:35:29,847 --> 00:35:33,442
- Looking at the fucking state of him.
- Don't fucking start, all right?

430
00:35:33,607 --> 00:35:36,838
What did I say to you?
One simple thing: No trouble.

431
00:35:37,007 --> 00:35:40,522
It had nothing to do with me.
He's walking home, he gets jumped.

432
00:35:40,687 --> 00:35:44,043
- He's lucky we was there.
- You're a real hero, ain't you, mate?

433
00:35:44,207 --> 00:35:47,324
And you saw the whole thing from your sofa?

434
00:35:47,487 --> 00:35:50,206
Concentrate on your family
and leave my business to me.

435
00:35:50,367 --> 00:35:53,006
My family? What is it with you, eh?

436
00:35:53,167 --> 00:35:57,957
Do you want mum to visit you in the nick?
Maybe you want the plot next to dad.

437
00:35:58,127 --> 00:36:02,200
- Oh, my God! Matt, what happened?
- Shannon, I'm fine.

438
00:36:02,367 --> 00:36:05,006
Pete, can't you see
what you're doing to this family?

439
00:36:05,167 --> 00:36:07,920
All I see is a scared old man.

440
00:36:08,087 --> 00:36:11,159
- Don't talk to me like that!
- You got the wrong idea.

441
00:36:11,327 --> 00:36:15,559
- Get your fucking hands off me!
- Stop it! Steve! Stop it!

442
00:36:15,727 --> 00:36:20,084
Get the fuck out! Get out! Fuck! Shit.

443
00:36:20,247 --> 00:36:22,203
[Baby cries]

444
00:36:23,607 --> 00:36:25,598
Babe, I'm so sorry.

445
00:36:29,967 --> 00:36:33,562
Well, that weren't the smartest of moves, mate.

446
00:36:33,727 --> 00:36:35,718
But thanks, yeah?

447
00:36:38,207 --> 00:36:40,357
- Fancy a pint?
- No.

448
00:36:40,527 --> 00:36:44,520
Oh, come on. You're the one
that's got to buy the bleeding thing.

449
00:36:47,767 --> 00:36:51,999
[Bovver] Get your cash out.
The fat bird's about to sing.

450
00:36:53,047 --> 00:36:55,117
Ah, shot.

451
00:36:55,287 --> 00:36:58,199
Jesus! You two joined
at the fucking hip or what?

452
00:36:58,367 --> 00:37:02,724
- Leave it out, Bov. It's getting old.
- No, I'm starting to wonder about you two.

453
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:07,324
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say you was a couple of gay boys.

454
00:37:09,487 --> 00:37:14,197
Bov, we've known each other
a long time, yeah?

455
00:37:14,367 --> 00:37:17,439
I trust you more than any other bloke I know.

456
00:37:17,607 --> 00:37:21,805
But you're getting dangerously close
to crossing the line with me.

457
00:37:21,967 --> 00:37:27,200
If you've got a problem,
then it's your fucking problem, not mine.

458
00:37:27,367 --> 00:37:30,882
But if you want to discuss it further,
we can go outside.

459
00:37:31,047 --> 00:37:35,962
- Beers, boys.
- Hey, Bov. It's your shot, mate.

460
00:37:36,127 --> 00:37:40,484
Come on. Let's crack on with the game.

461
00:37:40,647 --> 00:37:44,720
[Barman] Pete. Everything all right, mate?

462
00:37:50,487 --> 00:37:54,162
I can't believe you came all this way
and didn't even stay the night.

463
00:37:54,327 --> 00:37:58,081
- I don't want to mess anything else up.
- You didn't mess anything up.

464
00:37:58,247 --> 00:38:02,240
- So you and Steve are OK?
- Yeah. Yeah, we're fine.

465
00:38:02,407 --> 00:38:05,205
All right, well, I'll call you from Pete's.

466
00:38:09,807 --> 00:38:13,163
Matt. Please don't go.

467
00:38:14,407 --> 00:38:16,682
Steve feels so horrible about what happened

468
00:38:16,847 --> 00:38:21,079
and he really wants you to stay with us,
and so do I.

469
00:38:21,247 --> 00:38:25,479
- I don't want you to stay with Pete.
- Well, I wanna stay with Pete.

470
00:38:26,767 --> 00:38:29,076
Pete and his thug friends aren't the answer.

471
00:38:30,727 --> 00:38:33,924
What are you talking about? What answer?

472
00:38:36,367 --> 00:38:40,280
I've been begging you to come and visit me
for the last three years

473
00:38:40,447 --> 00:38:43,041
and you didn't even come to my wedding and...

474
00:38:43,207 --> 00:38:45,721
You don't know my husband,
haven't held your nephew,

475
00:38:45,887 --> 00:38:49,118
and you show up on my doorstep yesterday
and you're leaving already.

476
00:38:49,287 --> 00:38:53,075
Look who's talking. You ran
to another fucking country after Mom died.

477
00:39:01,887 --> 00:39:03,684
I'm sorry.

478
00:39:08,687 --> 00:39:11,724
- You come and visit me.
- Yeah, of course.

479
00:39:19,687 --> 00:39:22,247
[Pete] Jeremy Van Holden?

480
00:39:23,487 --> 00:39:25,876
Sounds like a cunt.

481
00:39:26,047 --> 00:39:31,360
Mate, if he'd done that to me,
I'd smash seven shades of shit out of him.

482
00:39:33,527 --> 00:39:36,997
Sounds like these Harvard boys
would slit your throat in your sleep.

483
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:41,763
What was you studying,
before this geezer stitched you up?

484
00:39:41,927 --> 00:39:45,886
- History.
- History? I teach history.

485
00:39:46,047 --> 00:39:50,837
- You teach?
- Yes, cheeky slag.

486
00:39:51,007 --> 00:39:55,398
History and PE. What, did you think
the GSE paid a bloody wage?

487
00:39:55,567 --> 00:39:58,240
I'm smart as fuck.

488
00:39:58,407 --> 00:40:01,558
Come on, it's brass monkeys out here.

489
00:40:03,887 --> 00:40:06,799
Class, today we have
an extraordinarily distinguished guest.

490
00:40:06,967 --> 00:40:13,202
Mr Buckner is an American who went to the
finest university in the United States, Harvard.

491
00:40:13,367 --> 00:40:15,961
But despite his prestigious education,

492
00:40:16,127 --> 00:40:22,646
Mr Buckner still thinks that baseball
is better than football.

493
00:40:22,807 --> 00:40:24,798
[Boys shout]

494
00:40:24,967 --> 00:40:27,435
I know, boys. It's an utter sin.

495
00:40:27,607 --> 00:40:30,485
It's our job to save this heathen
from his evil ways

496
00:40:30,647 --> 00:40:33,525
and teach him what really matters in life,
and that is?

497
00:40:33,687 --> 00:40:37,157
- Football!
- Exactly. We're going to play five-a-side.

498
00:40:37,327 --> 00:40:40,603
Mr Buckner will be goalie for the away colours.

499
00:40:40,767 --> 00:40:44,555
Now, go easy on him, boys.
You know how these Americans bruise.

500
00:40:46,247 --> 00:40:48,317
[Shouting]

501
00:40:50,487 --> 00:40:54,002
How do we keep this fair?
I let every other ball go through?

502
00:40:54,167 --> 00:40:56,362
I wouldn't worry about that.

503
00:40:57,407 --> 00:40:59,398
All right. You ready?

504
00:41:09,007 --> 00:41:11,396
[Pete] Go on, son.

505
00:41:12,207 --> 00:41:14,243
That's it! That's it!

506
00:41:14,407 --> 00:41:17,160
Ah, beautiful! Beautiful!

507
00:41:18,247 --> 00:41:20,238
Relax, kids.

508
00:41:22,807 --> 00:41:27,722
[Pete] Go on, Duncan. Go on, Duncan,
have it. Take it all the way.

509
00:41:29,447 --> 00:41:31,722
Have it. Have a dig, mate.

510
00:41:33,047 --> 00:41:35,515
- [Cheering]
- [Pete] Oh, beautiful goal!

511
00:41:42,367 --> 00:41:44,517
All right, that's it.

512
00:41:57,407 --> 00:41:59,841
What was that?

513
00:42:02,167 --> 00:42:04,158
Go on, my son.

514
00:42:05,847 --> 00:42:07,883
Beautiful. Sheer beauty.

515
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:14,115
- Lovely.
- [Boys shouting]

516
00:42:14,287 --> 00:42:16,755
[Blows whistle]

517
00:42:16,927 --> 00:42:21,079
All right. Home team: 10. Away team: 3.

518
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:24,603
Thanks to some pathetic goalkeeping
from the away keeper.

519
00:42:24,767 --> 00:42:29,477
- All right, get yourselves changed, boys.
- Played.

520
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:33,526
- That's what I call a real ass-whipping.
- You set me up.

521
00:42:33,687 --> 00:42:36,155
That was like
the junior Olympic football team, right?

522
00:42:36,327 --> 00:42:40,036
No, mate. Just regular English boys.
We've got history next.

523
00:42:40,207 --> 00:42:43,279
Say a few words about
the American War of Independence.

524
00:42:43,447 --> 00:42:48,646
- They'd get a kick out of a real live colonial.
- American history isn't really my specialty.

525
00:42:48,807 --> 00:42:51,719
Mate, they're ten.
Teach them whatever you want.

526
00:42:51,887 --> 00:42:55,323
Well, I sort of have plans
with Shannon this afternoon.

527
00:42:55,487 --> 00:42:58,559
- We'll have a beer later.
- Yeah, see you at the pub.

528
00:42:58,727 --> 00:43:02,003
All right, mate. Who are you? Who are you?

529
00:43:02,647 --> 00:43:07,721
But these kids... He set me up, man. I'm
thinking this is some class of kids, little ones.

530
00:43:07,887 --> 00:43:09,878
Shut up.

531
00:43:11,727 --> 00:43:15,606
- They're coming in everywhere...
- Oh, come on.

532
00:43:22,367 --> 00:43:24,722
No, no. No.

533
00:43:24,887 --> 00:43:26,878
[Cheering]

534
00:44:01,007 --> 00:44:03,646
- Fat cunt.
- Fucking fat bastard.

535
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:06,879
- Hello, mate.
- Get the fucking chips in.

536
00:44:07,047 --> 00:44:11,040
Well, I'll be fucked.
If it ain't my old mate Bovver.

537
00:44:12,407 --> 00:44:14,875
How are you doing, son, all right?

538
00:44:15,047 --> 00:44:20,121
I'll say one thing, you got some fucking front
showing your face over this side of the water.

539
00:44:20,287 --> 00:44:24,519
There's plenty of people round here love to kick
your fucking arse, given half the chance.

540
00:44:24,687 --> 00:44:28,885
- There's four of 'em stood over there.
- Fucking right, son.

541
00:44:29,047 --> 00:44:34,804
So, Bov, what's all this I'm hearing about
your firm gone all fucking international, eh?

542
00:44:37,527 --> 00:44:42,647
Don't you even fucking think
about ignoring me, you little cunt.

543
00:44:42,807 --> 00:44:48,200
Now, I said what's all this bollocks I'm hearing
about you having a little Yank on the firm?

544
00:44:50,847 --> 00:44:54,078
It's only temporary.

545
00:44:54,247 --> 00:44:57,876
- Temporary, eh?
- [Chatting and laughter]

546
00:44:58,047 --> 00:45:03,599
Do you think I can get a bit of quiet here?
I'm trying to have a fucking conversation!

547
00:45:04,527 --> 00:45:07,837
- [Whispers] What's his problem?
- Shh.

548
00:45:08,007 --> 00:45:11,966
So, look at you, little Bovver.
All grown up now, look.

549
00:45:12,127 --> 00:45:14,163
- Where's your other little girl...?
- [Man] Petey.

550
00:45:14,327 --> 00:45:17,000
Petey? She at home, is she?

551
00:45:17,167 --> 00:45:22,116
Trying to get her little toes
into the Major's big fucking shoes?

552
00:45:22,287 --> 00:45:26,758
I guess we was pretty small back then, son.
Back in your day.

553
00:45:30,567 --> 00:45:33,718
You always did have a bit of bottle, you.

554
00:45:33,887 --> 00:45:38,881
- So tell me, Bov. You come over to Millwall.
- [Woman] Is he a bit of a bully?

555
00:45:39,047 --> 00:45:44,167
- Did you come alone?
- [Woman laughs]

556
00:45:44,327 --> 00:45:47,683
What do you think?
Do you think that'd wind him up?

557
00:45:47,847 --> 00:45:51,681
- [She laughs]
- Excuse me a minute, Bov.

558
00:45:54,567 --> 00:45:59,277
Hello. I'm Tommy. Tommy Hatcher.

559
00:45:59,447 --> 00:46:02,678
- Yeah, I know.
- Oh, you know?

560
00:46:02,847 --> 00:46:05,964
Well, now, you see, that's bad.
That's really, really bad.

561
00:46:06,127 --> 00:46:10,166
You ain't got no fucking excuse
for not keeping that shit cunt of yours quiet.

562
00:46:10,327 --> 00:46:12,887
George, he can't talk to me like that.

563
00:46:13,047 --> 00:46:17,518
George, your bird hasn't stopped
fucking rabbiting since I've walked in here!

564
00:46:17,687 --> 00:46:20,201
Now, can I recommend that you shut her up?

565
00:46:20,367 --> 00:46:24,121
So I can continue my conversation
with our guest there, Bovver,

566
00:46:24,287 --> 00:46:26,278
of the once-proud GSE firm.

567
00:46:26,447 --> 00:46:29,598
- You can't tell me... Oh, my God!
- See what she's doing?

568
00:46:29,767 --> 00:46:33,521
Does she ever fucking, sodding, ever...?

569
00:46:33,687 --> 00:46:36,360
- That's enough!
- That's enough?

570
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:39,564
I'll tell you when it's enough, son, all right?

571
00:46:39,727 --> 00:46:43,515
Tommy, the Paki's called the Old Bill, mate.
We best fuck off.

572
00:46:43,687 --> 00:46:46,076
Tommy, we best fuck off sharpish, mate.

573
00:46:48,887 --> 00:46:52,084
I'll see you again. Soon, Bov.

574
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:25,996
I don't reckon I'll be back till tomorrow night.

575
00:47:26,167 --> 00:47:30,843
- Be gentle with her. And remember, left side.
- Left side. Right.

576
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:39,800
- You seem nervous.
- Nervous? Fuck off.

577
00:47:39,967 --> 00:47:41,958
What's on your mind, then?

578
00:47:42,127 --> 00:47:46,643
Two little words keep every Hammer
in England up all night: United away.

579
00:47:46,807 --> 00:47:49,196
- Oi, oi!
- Aye aye!

580
00:47:50,807 --> 00:47:54,561
- All right, mate. You all right?
- Yeah, all right, big man?

581
00:47:54,727 --> 00:47:56,718
- Hello, Matt.
- All right?

582
00:47:58,567 --> 00:48:00,558
- Where's Bovver?
- Fuck knows.

583
00:48:00,727 --> 00:48:03,719
He's been a pain in the arse all week. PMS.

584
00:48:03,887 --> 00:48:07,846
Pre-Match Stress.
He's being a right cunt at the minute.

585
00:48:08,007 --> 00:48:11,397
- Come on, Pete. The train's in five minutes.
- Yeah, hang on.

586
00:48:14,207 --> 00:48:17,961
His phone's off. I can't believe
he's gonna pull a runner for United away.

587
00:48:18,127 --> 00:48:22,757
They'll be gunning for you, too, after the job
you pulled on their top boy last year.

588
00:48:22,927 --> 00:48:25,441
What happened last year?

589
00:48:25,607 --> 00:48:28,883
- I may have gone a bit over the top.
- Just a bit.

590
00:48:29,047 --> 00:48:32,039
- Where's Dave? Have you heard from him?
- Have you?

591
00:48:32,207 --> 00:48:36,359
Oh, everything's just falling
right into place, isn't it?

592
00:48:36,527 --> 00:48:39,485
- I'll go.
- No, mate.

593
00:48:39,647 --> 00:48:42,719
What? You can't just go up there
with lke and Swill.

594
00:48:42,887 --> 00:48:45,640
No offence, but we can't
take passengers on this trip.

595
00:48:45,807 --> 00:48:50,278
- Go on, piss off. Give you a bell later.
- How many reds d'you reckon'll turn up?

596
00:48:50,447 --> 00:48:52,642
Fuck knows.

597
00:48:52,807 --> 00:48:55,526
- Catch.
- How's that?
