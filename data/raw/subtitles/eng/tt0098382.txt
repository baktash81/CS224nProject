1
00:01:48,877 --> 00:01:54,048
I thought weapons were forbidden
on this planet.

2
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:01,795
Besides...

3
00:02:03,097 --> 00:02:08,696
...I can't believe you'd kill me
for a field of empty holes.

4
00:02:10,576 --> 00:02:13,601
It's all I have.

5
00:02:36,637 --> 00:02:41,607
- Your pain runs deep.
- What do you know of my pain?

6
00:02:41,634 --> 00:02:45,453
Let us explore it... together.

7
00:02:45,524 --> 00:02:48,999
Each man hides a secret pain.

8
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:53,243
It must be exposed and reckoned with.

9
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:57,789
It must be dragged
from the darkness into the light.

10
00:02:57,832 --> 00:03:02,660
Share your pain.
Share your pain with me.

11
00:03:02,696 --> 00:03:05,958
And gain strength from the sharing.

12
00:03:24,899 --> 00:03:27,639
Where did you get this power?

13
00:03:31,809 --> 00:03:35,035
The power was within you.

14
00:03:37,108 --> 00:03:43,278
It is as if a weight
has been lifted from my heart.

15
00:03:43,278 --> 00:03:48,178
- How can I repay you?
- Join my quest.

16
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:53,737
- What is it you seek?
- What you seek.

17
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:02,563
What all men have sought
since time began.

18
00:04:02,563 --> 00:04:06,169
The ultimate knowledge.

19
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:10,007
To find it we need a starship.

20
00:04:10,111 --> 00:04:14,310
A starship? There are
no starships on Nimbus III.

21
00:04:14,369 --> 00:04:18,640
- I have a way to bring one here.
- But how?

22
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,591
Have faith, my friend.
There are more of us than you know.

23
00:04:27,618 --> 00:04:30,500
You're a Vulcan.

24
00:08:59,722 --> 00:09:04,064
"You'll have a great time
on shore leave, Bones."

25
00:09:04,093 --> 00:09:07,248
"You'll be able to relax."

26
00:09:07,331 --> 00:09:11,850
You call this relaxing?
I'm a nervous wreck.

27
00:09:11,868 --> 00:09:16,067
If I'm not careful,
I'll end up talking to myself.

28
00:09:30,554 --> 00:09:33,887
Greetings, Captain.

29
00:09:33,956 --> 00:09:39,962
- Spock, what are you doing here?
- I'm monitoring your progress.

30
00:09:39,962 --> 00:09:44,897
I'm flattered, but of all the
points of interest here why pick me?

31
00:09:44,901 --> 00:09:51,174
The record for climbing El Capitan
is in no danger of being broken.

32
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:55,801
I'm doing this because I enjoy it.

33
00:09:55,812 --> 00:10:00,640
Not to mention the most important
reason for climbing a mountain...

34
00:10:00,651 --> 00:10:04,779
Because it's there.

35
00:10:04,821 --> 00:10:08,925
I do not think you realise
the gravity of your situation.

36
00:10:12,763 --> 00:10:16,096
On the contrary,
gravity is foremost on my mind.

37
00:10:16,165 --> 00:10:21,437
I'm trying to make an ascent.
Go pester Dr McCoy.

38
00:10:21,437 --> 00:10:26,442
Dr McCoy is not in the best of moods.

39
00:10:26,442 --> 00:10:30,025
Goddamn irresponsible!

40
00:10:31,315 --> 00:10:34,410
Playing games with life.

41
00:10:34,484 --> 00:10:38,482
Concentration is vital.
You must be one with the rock.

42
00:10:38,522 --> 00:10:42,163
If you don't stop distracting me...

43
00:11:07,049 --> 00:11:11,177
Perhaps "because it is there" is not
sufficient reason to climb a mountain.

44
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,375
I am hardly in a position to disagree.

45
00:11:15,792 --> 00:11:18,948
Hi, Bones.
Mind if we drop in for dinner?

46
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:32,536
- I am Caithlin Dar.
- Yes! Our new Romulan representative.

47
00:12:32,536 --> 00:12:39,176
Welcome to Paradise City, capital
of the Planet of Galactic Peace.

48
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:43,862
I'm St John Talbot, the Federation
Representative here on Nimbus III.

49
00:12:43,914 --> 00:12:48,777
My charming companion
is the Klingon Consul, Korrd.

50
00:12:51,989 --> 00:12:56,888
- I expect that's Klingon for hello.
- Come in, my dear.

51
00:13:13,409 --> 00:13:19,683
20 years ago, our three governments
agreed to develop this planet.

52
00:13:19,683 --> 00:13:25,489
- A new age was born.
- It died a quick death.

53
00:13:25,489 --> 00:13:31,228
The settlers we conned into
coming here took to fighting.

54
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:35,226
We forbad them weapons,
but they fashioned their own.

55
00:13:35,264 --> 00:13:38,598
It appears I've arrived just in time.

56
00:14:38,394 --> 00:14:42,142
Get away from that transmitter.

57
00:14:47,703 --> 00:14:50,443
Romulan.

58
00:14:51,507 --> 00:14:54,567
Terran.

59
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:56,790
Klingon.

60
00:14:56,947 --> 00:15:01,218
- Consider yourselves my prisoners.
- Prisoners?

61
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:06,113
We're already prisoners here
on this worthless lump of rock.

62
00:15:06,123 --> 00:15:11,022
- What value could we be to you?
- Nimbus III <i>is</i> a worthless lump of rock.

63
00:15:11,028 --> 00:15:16,799
But it is the only place in the galaxy
that has the three of you.

64
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:23,639
Our governments will stop at nothing
to ensure our safety.

65
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:26,735
That's exactly what I'm counting on.

66
00:15:36,887 --> 00:15:40,885
<i>USS Enterprise,</i>
<i>shakedown cruise report.</i>

67
00:15:40,923 --> 00:15:46,128
<i>I think this new ship</i>
<i>was put together by monkeys.</i>

68
00:15:46,128 --> 00:15:51,667
<i>Half the doors won't open, and guess</i>
<i>whosejob it is to make it right?</i>

69
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:54,170
Borgus frat!

70
00:15:56,173 --> 00:16:00,407
"Let's see what she's got, Scotty."
We found out, didn't we?

71
00:16:00,476 --> 00:16:05,447
- I know you'll whip her into shape.
- Uhura, I thought you were on leave.

72
00:16:05,449 --> 00:16:11,534
- I thought we were going together.
- I can't leave her when she needs me.

73
00:16:12,755 --> 00:16:16,468
I had a feeling you would
say something like that.

74
00:16:16,525 --> 00:16:19,621
So I brought us dinner.

75
00:16:19,695 --> 00:16:24,974
You're the most understanding woman
I know.

76
00:16:25,634 --> 00:16:29,668
<i>Red alert.</i>

77
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:33,902
I just fixed that damn thing!

78
00:16:33,976 --> 00:16:36,609
Turn it off, will you?

79
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:40,007
<i>Red alert.</i>

80
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:44,151
<i>This is a red alert.</i>
<i>Enterprise, acknowledge.</i>

81
00:16:45,788 --> 00:16:49,192
This is Enterprise. Identify yourself.

82
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:55,931
<i>This is Starfleet. We have a Priority 7</i>
<i>situation in the Neutral Zone.</i>

83
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:59,822
- Scotty, this is for real.
- They can't be serious!

84
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:03,974
The ship's in pieces and
we've got less than a skeleton crew.

85
00:17:05,174 --> 00:17:08,400
Starfleet, are you aware
of our current status?

86
00:17:08,512 --> 00:17:15,356
<i>Yes. Stand by to copy operational</i>
<i>orders and recall key personnel.</i>

87
00:17:16,052 --> 00:17:20,951
- Admit it, we're lost.
- Yes, but we're making good time.

88
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:26,429
- <i>Commander Sulu, come in.</i>
- I don't believe this.

89
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:28,754
Shore leave is cancelled.

90
00:17:28,864 --> 00:17:34,303
- Rescued at last.
- <i>Return to prearranged coordinates.</i>

91
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:39,760
- You can't say we're lost.
- Is there a problem?

92
00:17:39,775 --> 00:17:46,277
Yes. We've been caught in... a blizzard.

93
00:17:49,385 --> 00:17:54,106
We can't see a thing.
Direct us to the coordinates.

94
00:17:54,123 --> 00:17:59,402
My visual says
sunny skies and 70 degrees.

95
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:06,316
Look, the sun has come out.
It's a miracle.

96
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:10,606
<i>Don't worry, your secret is safe</i>
<i>with me. I'll send the shuttle for you.</i>

97
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:12,999
Uhura, I owe you one.

98
00:18:15,411 --> 00:18:18,116
Come and get it!

99
00:18:18,215 --> 00:18:20,955
Bones, knock it off.

100
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:24,311
We're right here and we're starving.

101
00:18:24,387 --> 00:18:29,143
- Bipodal seeds, Doctor?
- Beans, Spock, but no ordinary beans.

102
00:18:29,158 --> 00:18:33,677
These are from an old recipe
handed down to me by my father.

103
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:36,793
If you stick your Vulcan nose
up at these...

104
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:41,457
you're insulting
generations of McCoys.

105
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:46,785
In that case I have little choice
but to sample your beans.

106
00:18:53,816 --> 00:18:58,854
Surprisingly good. It does have
a flavouring I'm not familiar with.

107
00:18:58,854 --> 00:19:04,240
- That's the secret ingredient.
- Any more secret ingredient, Bones?

108
00:19:05,528 --> 00:19:07,959
Be my guest.

109
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:14,904
- Your secret ingredient is alcohol?
- Tennessee whiskey.

110
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:19,175
Bourbon and beans, an explosive
combination. Can Spock handle it?

111
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:26,248
With that Vulcan metabolism,
he could eat a bowl of termites.

112
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:32,192
- Doctor, I am half human.
- It certainly doesn't show.

113
00:19:33,657 --> 00:19:36,503
- Thank you.
- This guy never changes.

114
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:40,625
I insult him
and he takes it as a compliment.

115
00:19:43,199 --> 00:19:48,771
- You two could drive a man to drink.
- What did I do?

116
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:56,278
Human life is far too precious
to risk on crazy stunts.

117
00:19:56,278 --> 00:20:02,084
You should have been killed
when you fell off that mountain.

118
00:20:02,084 --> 00:20:05,002
It did cross my mind.

119
00:20:05,087 --> 00:20:08,313
But even as I fell
I knew I wouldn't die.

120
00:20:08,391 --> 00:20:13,963
- Isn't he the only one who's immortal?
- No, it isn't that.

121
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:19,235
I knew I wouldn't die
because the two of you were with me.

122
00:20:19,235 --> 00:20:24,027
- I do not understand.
- I've always known...

123
00:20:24,073 --> 00:20:26,920
...I'll die alone.

124
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:35,937
I'll call Valhalla and
reserve a room for you.

125
00:20:40,357 --> 00:20:47,029
All that time in space,
getting on each other's nerves...

126
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:53,803
So what do we do on shore leave?
We spend it together.

127
00:20:53,803 --> 00:20:58,844
- Other people have families.
- Other people, not us.

128
00:21:05,414 --> 00:21:08,119
What are you doing?

129
00:21:08,217 --> 00:21:12,144
I'm preparing to toast a "marsh melon".

130
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:18,928
I'll be damned! A marsh melon.
Where did you learn to do that?

131
00:21:18,928 --> 00:21:26,202
I have familiarised myself with the
customs associated with camping out.

132
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:33,142
What do we do
after we toast the marsh melon?

133
00:21:33,142 --> 00:21:38,447
- We consume them.
- No, I mean after that.

134
00:21:38,447 --> 00:21:44,286
We are required to engage in a ritual
known as the sing-along.

135
00:21:44,286 --> 00:21:49,425
I haven't sung around the campfire
since I was a boy in Iowa.

136
00:21:49,425 --> 00:21:52,201
What are we going to sing?

137
00:21:52,294 --> 00:21:55,734
- "Camptown Races".
- "Pack up your troubles".

138
00:21:55,798 --> 00:21:58,989
- Are we leaving?
- It's a song title.

139
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:04,383
- "Moon over Rigel 7".
- "Row, row, row your boat".

140
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:09,199
- Do you know "Row your boat"?
- It didn't come up in my research.

141
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:12,127
The lyrics are very simple...

142
00:22:12,214 --> 00:22:15,132
"Row, row, row your boat
gently down the stream."

143
00:22:15,217 --> 00:22:19,808
"Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily,
life is but a dream."

144
00:22:19,822 --> 00:22:24,543
The Doctor and I will start off
and you jump in.

145
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:31,239
- Doctor, if you please.
- Don't say I didn't warn you.

146
00:22:46,082 --> 00:22:51,654
- Spock, why didn't you jump in?
- I cannot comprehend the words.

147
00:22:51,654 --> 00:22:58,694
It's a song, you green-blooded Vulcan.
The words aren't important.

148
00:22:58,694 --> 00:23:04,851
- You just have a good time singing.
- I am sorry, Doctor.

149
00:23:05,468 --> 00:23:09,951
- Were we having a good time?
- I liked him better before he died.

150
00:23:10,006 --> 00:23:14,632
Let's just get some sleep.

151
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:28,526
- Captain...
- We're on leave. Call me Jim.

152
00:23:28,557 --> 00:23:31,060
- Jim...
- Yes, Spock?

153
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:34,800
Life is not a dream.

154
00:23:34,864 --> 00:23:38,992
- Go to sleep, Spock.
- Yes, Captain.

155
00:23:40,236 --> 00:23:44,269
- Good night, Bones.
- Good night, Jim.

156
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:49,061
- Good night, Spock.
- Good night, Doctor.

157
00:23:49,111 --> 00:23:53,346
- Good night, Spock.
- Good night, Jim.

158
00:23:55,151 --> 00:23:58,176
I don't know. I just don't know.

159
00:25:46,329 --> 00:25:49,590
Get the damn light out of my face.

160
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:03,355
We had to send the shuttlecraft.

161
00:26:03,412 --> 00:26:06,746
The transporter is non-operational.

162
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:12,388
- We have received new orders.
- I had my communicator.

163
00:26:12,388 --> 00:26:16,979
- You forgot to take it with you.
- I wonder why I did that.

164
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:23,150
It appears shore leave has been
cancelled. Pack out your trash.

165
00:26:54,629 --> 00:26:59,669
"All I ask is a tall ship
and a star to steer her by."

166
00:26:59,669 --> 00:27:03,523
- Melville.
- John Masefield.

167
00:27:03,606 --> 00:27:08,778
- Are you sure about that?
- I'm well-versed in the classics.

168
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:13,816
Then how come you don't know
"Row, row, row your boat"?

169
00:27:22,591 --> 00:27:27,313
- <i>Enterprise, you have control.</i>
- We're doing just fine.

170
00:28:03,165 --> 00:28:07,020
All I can say is, they don't make them
like they used to.

171
00:28:07,068 --> 00:28:11,101
You told me you could have this ship
operational in two weeks.

172
00:28:11,173 --> 00:28:14,507
I think you gave me too much time.

173
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:20,248
How many times do I have to tell you?
The right tool for the right job.

174
00:28:20,248 --> 00:28:23,831
I've never seen him happier.

175
00:28:23,885 --> 00:28:26,910
Bridge... I hope.

176
00:28:33,728 --> 00:28:37,274
I could use a shower.

177
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:39,694
Yes.

178
00:28:42,972 --> 00:28:49,295
- Doesn't anything work on this ship?
- They can't send us out like this.

179
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:55,942
- Starfleet transmission on line.
- Put it on the view screen.

180
00:28:58,621 --> 00:29:01,610
Can we have a little quiet, please?

181
00:29:07,063 --> 00:29:10,158
Can you clear that up?

182
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:15,941
Can we have a little quiet?

183
00:29:16,005 --> 00:29:18,994
- Bob!
- <i>Jim!</i>

184
00:29:19,107 --> 00:29:24,145
- <i>We are dressing informally.</i>
- I'm on my way to the shower.

185
00:29:24,145 --> 00:29:27,371
<i>I apologise for cancelling shore leave.</i>

186
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:31,684
<i>We have a dangerous situation</i>
<i>out on Nimbus III.</i>

187
00:29:31,721 --> 00:29:34,781
On the Planet of Galactic Peace?

188
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:40,228
<i>A terrorist force</i>
<i>has captured the only settlement.</i>

189
00:29:40,228 --> 00:29:44,641
<i>They've taken hostages. The Klingon,</i>
<i>the Romulan, the Federation Consuls.</i>

190
00:29:44,667 --> 00:29:52,375
- <i>The Enterprise is not up to specs...</i>
- The Enterprise is a disaster.

191
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:57,274
- We have ships in the quadrant.
- <i>But no experienced commanders.</i>

192
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,613
- <i>I need Jim Kirk.</i>
- Please!

193
00:30:00,683 --> 00:30:04,645
<i>Proceed to Nimbus III</i>
<i>and assess the situation.</i>

194
00:30:04,687 --> 00:30:07,284
<i>Avoid a confrontation.</i>

195
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:11,518
<i>Above all, however,</i>
<i>get those hostages back safely.</i>

196
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:17,233
- Have the Klingons responded?
- <i>No, but you can bet they will.</i>

197
00:30:17,233 --> 00:30:23,239
- Plot a course for Nimbus III, Mr Sulu.
- Course plotted.

198
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:26,987
I'm afraid the ship's problems
will have to be solved en route.

199
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:32,547
I'm counting on each one of you
to give his best. Let's go to work.

200
00:30:32,547 --> 00:30:37,066
Jim, if you ask me, and you haven't...

201
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:41,248
I think this is a terrible idea.
We're bound to bump into the Klingons.

202
00:30:41,289 --> 00:30:45,631
- And they don't exactly like you.
- The feeling's mutual.

203
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:50,251
Engine room, we'll need all the power
you can muster, mister.

204
00:30:50,266 --> 00:30:55,470
We'll beat those Klingon devils
even if I have to get out and push.

205
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:58,625
I hope it won't come to that.

206
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:02,381
- All possible speed, Mr Sulu.
- Aye, sir.

207
00:31:08,284 --> 00:31:12,388
- What's the matter?
- I miss my old chair.

208
00:31:50,258 --> 00:31:53,841
Captain's log: Stardate 84...

209
00:31:58,099 --> 00:32:01,954
Captain's log: Stardate 84...

210
00:32:03,538 --> 00:32:07,287
- <i>Good morning, Captain.</i>
- Forget it.

211
00:32:07,375 --> 00:32:14,115
- We have the hostage information.
- Put it on the screen.

212
00:32:14,115 --> 00:32:19,845
<i>This is an authorised transmission</i>
<i>from the Starfleet memory bank.</i>

213
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:27,295
- Not General Korrd!
- He's apparently fallen from favour.

214
00:32:27,295 --> 00:32:32,600
Korrd's military strategies were
required learning at the Academy.

215
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:37,500
When they put me out to pasture,
I hope I fair better than Korrd.

216
00:32:39,774 --> 00:32:42,348
This must be the hostage tape.

217
00:32:42,944 --> 00:32:49,160
<i>A short time ago, we surrendered</i>
<i>to the Galactic Army of Light.</i>

218
00:32:50,585 --> 00:32:54,263
<i>We are now in the protective custody</i>
<i>of their leader.</i>

219
00:32:54,322 --> 00:32:58,249
<i>We will be treated humanely</i>
<i>as long as we cooperate.</i>

220
00:32:58,294 --> 00:33:04,667
<i>He requests that you send a starship</i>
<i>to parley for our release at once.</i>

221
00:33:04,667 --> 00:33:10,123
<i>We are in good health and would</i>
<i>appreciate your immediate response.</i>

222
00:33:13,508 --> 00:33:17,327
<i>I regret this desperate act,</i>
<i>but these are desperate times.</i>

223
00:33:17,379 --> 00:33:22,100
<i>I mean no harm to these innocents,</i>
<i>but do not put me to the test.</i>

224
00:33:22,118 --> 00:33:27,360
<i>I implore you to respond immediately.</i>

225
00:33:40,535 --> 00:33:43,275
What is it?

226
00:33:43,371 --> 00:33:49,564
- You look like you've seen a ghost.
- Perhaps I have, Captain.

227
00:34:14,869 --> 00:34:19,460
Spock, what is it?
Do you know this Vulcan?

228
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:22,914
- I cannot be certain.
- But he does seem familiar?

229
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:26,761
He reminds me of someone
I knew in my youth.

230
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:32,854
- I didn't know you had one.
- I do not often think of the past.

231
00:34:32,854 --> 00:34:38,928
- Who does he remind you of?
- A gifted young student.

232
00:34:38,928 --> 00:34:43,199
He possessed a great intelligence.

233
00:34:44,132 --> 00:34:50,039
It was assumed that he would
join the great scholars of Vulcan.

234
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:53,585
- But he was a revolutionary.
- What do you mean?

235
00:34:53,641 --> 00:34:58,541
The knowledge he sought
was forbidden by Vulcan belief.

236
00:34:58,546 --> 00:35:03,885
- Forbidden?
- He rejected his logical upbringing.

237
00:35:03,885 --> 00:35:08,441
He embraced the animal passions
of our ancestors.

238
00:35:08,456 --> 00:35:15,797
He believed the key to self-knowledge
was emotion... not logic.

239
00:35:15,797 --> 00:35:19,403
Imagine that, a passionate Vulcan.

240
00:35:19,467 --> 00:35:25,373
When he encouraged others to follow
him, he was banished from Vulcan.

241
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,626
Fascinating.

242
00:35:27,776 --> 00:35:31,595
- <i>Captain to the bridge.</i>
- On my way.

243
00:35:36,851 --> 00:35:39,947
- Spock?
- Coming, Captain.

244
00:35:45,427 --> 00:35:51,891
- Approaching Nimbus III.
- Standard orbit, Mr Sulu.

245
00:35:53,002 --> 00:35:58,907
Paradise City is demanding
to know our intentions.

246
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:03,390
Respond with static.
Let them think we're having difficulty.

247
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:08,783
Paradise City, we are barely
receiving your transmission.

248
00:36:08,783 --> 00:36:15,857
- Transporter room, status.
- Transporter is still inoperative.

249
00:36:15,857 --> 00:36:21,800
If we <i>could</i> lock on to the hostages,
we couldn't beam them up.

250
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:27,392
- We'll have to get them out ourselves.
- Klingon vessel approaching.

251
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:31,076
Bird of Prey.
1.9 hours till her weapons are in range.

252
00:36:31,172 --> 00:36:34,268
Damn! Let's go.

253
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:57,604
Their scanning equipment
is primitive, but effective.

254
00:36:57,665 --> 00:37:02,737
- Land at coordinate 856.3.
- That's far from the city.

255
00:37:02,737 --> 00:37:08,229
- We cannot risk detection.
- Mr Sulu, execute.

256
00:37:14,582 --> 00:37:19,933
- <i>This is the starship Enterprise.</i>
- A Federation starship.

257
00:37:22,891 --> 00:37:28,830
<i>This is Captain Pavel Chekov.</i>
<i>You are in violation of our treaty.</i>

258
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:32,899
<i>Release your hostages at once</i>
<i>or suffer the consequences.</i>

259
00:37:32,934 --> 00:37:36,575
Your threats amuse me.
What consequences?

260
00:37:59,461 --> 00:38:05,033
<i>A Klingon warship</i>
<i>will arrive within the hour.</i>

261
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:10,525
- The Klingons will be quite angry.
- <i>They are likely to destroy the planet.</i>

262
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:14,951
Then it is fortunate I have you
and your starship to protect me.

263
00:38:15,009 --> 00:38:20,982
You and your first officer
are to beam down to my coordinates.

264
00:38:20,982 --> 00:38:27,661
<i>We will be happy to beam down,</i>
<i>but we must have certain assurances.</i>

265
00:38:30,658 --> 00:38:34,513
At foot speed the journey
to the city will take 1.2 hours.

266
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:38,240
We don't have 1.2 hours.

267
00:38:38,299 --> 00:38:44,065
Wait a minute... Perfect!
We'll have to get their attention.

268
00:39:00,288 --> 00:39:02,861
What's that?

269
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:11,869
Is she naked?

270
00:39:50,238 --> 00:39:52,350
Hello, boys.

271
00:39:53,742 --> 00:39:57,632
I've always wanted to play
to a captive audience.

272
00:40:05,019 --> 00:40:10,061
- Spock, be one with the horse.
- Yes, Captain.

273
00:40:14,562 --> 00:40:17,480
Open the gate.
It's our lookout party.

274
00:40:20,068 --> 00:40:23,887
Federation soldiers are right behind us.
Close the gate.

275
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,041
Where are they going?

276
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:38,827
- Spock...
- Hold your horse, I'm scanning.

277
00:40:44,092 --> 00:40:49,299
The hostages are being held
in that structure.

278
00:40:51,166 --> 00:40:53,597
Galileo, start your run.

279
00:40:57,572 --> 00:41:01,806
Phasers on stun.
Sulu, take out that light.

280
00:41:15,523 --> 00:41:21,128
- What's going on?
- <i>Surrender, you are under attack.</i>

281
00:41:21,128 --> 00:41:25,814
- It wasn't bloodshed I wanted.
- <i>Wait! Come back.</i>

282
00:42:11,312 --> 00:42:14,823
- Uhura, come on down.
- Roger, coming in.

283
00:43:00,295 --> 00:43:06,867
<i>Nimbus III is famous for its wildlife,</i>
<i>and the fishing is terrific!</i>

284
00:43:06,867 --> 00:43:11,280
<i>Easy financing through</i>
<i>Federation Federal can take you there.</i>

285
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:15,442
- Thank God.
- Please cooperate.

286
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:18,320
Hand over your weapons.

287
00:43:21,248 --> 00:43:24,546
Well done, my friends.

288
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:04,186
<i>Qual se tu?</i>

289
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,812
Spock!

290
00:44:17,037 --> 00:44:20,583
Spock, it's me.

291
00:44:20,642 --> 00:44:25,790
It's Sybok.
You've finally caught up with me.

292
00:44:28,315 --> 00:44:31,305
Don't you have anything to say to me?

293
00:44:33,455 --> 00:44:40,299
You are under arrest for 17 violations
of the Neutral Zone Treaty.

294
00:44:51,005 --> 00:44:56,644
- You've developed a sense of humour.
- I did not intend to amuse you.

295
00:44:56,644 --> 00:45:03,051
These are serious charges.
However, if you surrender now...

296
00:45:03,051 --> 00:45:09,065
I'm sorry, Spock, I'm not through
violating the Neutral Zone Treaty.

297
00:45:10,991 --> 00:45:15,891
In fact, I'm just getting started.
For my next violation...

298
00:45:15,896 --> 00:45:19,929
I intend to steal something.

299
00:45:19,968 --> 00:45:23,158
Something very big.

300
00:45:25,507 --> 00:45:27,689
Your starship.

301
00:45:27,842 --> 00:45:32,006
You staged all this
to get your hands on my ship?

302
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:37,384
- Who are you?
- Captain James T. Kirk.

303
00:45:37,384 --> 00:45:44,300
I thought Captain Chekov...
I see... very clever, Captain.

304
00:45:46,126 --> 00:45:51,655
Spock, you have been given
a second chance to join me.

305
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:59,007
- I am a Starfleet officer.
- Of course.

306
00:45:59,007 --> 00:46:03,420
Of course. Then I'll take the ship
without your help.

307
00:46:24,131 --> 00:46:27,535
- Shuttle en route.
- Position of Bird of Prey?

308
00:46:31,138 --> 00:46:32,870
Closing!

309
00:47:02,037 --> 00:47:08,309
- The Bird of Prey must have cloaked.
- Raise shields.

310
00:47:08,309 --> 00:47:11,856
- The shuttle?
- Do it. Go to red alert.

311
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:27,861
Once we control your vessel,
we'll bring up our followers.

312
00:47:27,896 --> 00:47:31,929
The Klingons are out there.
We'll be lucky to make it to the ship.

313
00:47:31,966 --> 00:47:34,848
<i>This is Enterprise, red alert.</i>

314
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:38,541
<i>Bird of Prey approaching.</i>
<i>Raising shields.</i>

315
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,760
Find a safe harbour.

316
00:47:42,977 --> 00:47:45,575
No!

317
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:50,874
No reply. Remain on course.

318
00:47:50,919 --> 00:47:55,438
Listen to me. In order for this
craft to enter the landing bay...

319
00:47:55,457 --> 00:48:00,178
Enterprise must lower the shields
and activate the tractor beam.

320
00:48:00,195 --> 00:48:05,599
- To re-raise the shields will take...
- 15.5 seconds.

321
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:10,083
An eternity, during which
we'll be vulnerable to attack.

322
00:48:10,105 --> 00:48:16,320
He speaks the truth. If my people
are cloaked, then they intend to strike.

323
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:23,118
- We cannot turn back.
- Let me do something.

324
00:48:23,118 --> 00:48:28,088
Very well, do what you must,
but no more.

325
00:48:34,895 --> 00:48:38,050
Enterprise, this is Kirk.

326
00:48:43,405 --> 00:48:48,861
Understand your situation.
Are unable to return to planet.

327
00:48:48,877 --> 00:48:55,378
Stand by to execute
emergency landing plan... B.

328
00:48:58,385 --> 00:49:06,689
- Emergency landing plan B?
- <i>B as in barricade.</i>

329
00:49:10,098 --> 00:49:13,218
What are you doing?

330
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:18,579
In order to lower and raise the shields
quickly, we'll forego the tractor beam.

331
00:49:18,605 --> 00:49:21,701
We'll fly her in manually.

332
00:49:21,810 --> 00:49:27,610
- How often have you done this?
- Actually, it's my first attempt.

333
00:49:29,483 --> 00:49:33,682
He's good... really.

334
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:40,347
Scotty, open bay doors.

335
00:49:51,505 --> 00:49:53,723
Scotty, lower shields.

336
00:49:53,874 --> 00:49:56,970
Lowering shields.

337
00:50:03,852 --> 00:50:10,009
- Bird of Prey bearing 105.2.
- Go, Sulu.

338
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,914
They're in.

339
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,332
Warp speed now!

340
00:51:30,939 --> 00:51:34,094
We must change course at once.

341
00:51:39,314 --> 00:51:42,374
I'll take you to the bridge.

342
00:52:18,118 --> 00:52:20,823
Pick it up.

343
00:52:26,927 --> 00:52:30,568
Sybok...

344
00:52:30,632 --> 00:52:33,063
You must surrender.

345
00:52:37,037 --> 00:52:39,742
No!

346
00:52:39,873 --> 00:52:45,402
- You must kill me.
- Shoot him!

347
00:52:56,323 --> 00:53:00,736
For a moment...
I thought you might actually do it.

348
00:53:07,035 --> 00:53:10,475
Put him in the brig with Captain Kirk.

349
00:53:14,741 --> 00:53:21,849
Spock, you will accompany me
to the bridge?

350
00:53:21,849 --> 00:53:26,996
No... I will not.

351
00:53:28,956 --> 00:53:32,052
You know I'm right.

352
00:53:37,332 --> 00:53:41,531
Then you must join them.

353
00:54:00,287 --> 00:54:05,959
- These two will be useful.
- Give us a moment alone.

354
00:54:05,959 --> 00:54:09,020
Don't be afraid.

355
00:54:24,778 --> 00:54:30,084
Goddamn it, Spock.
You betrayed us all.

356
00:54:30,084 --> 00:54:33,203
I do not expect you to forgive me.

357
00:54:33,287 --> 00:54:37,284
- I ought to knock you on your ass.
- If you think it would help.

358
00:54:37,324 --> 00:54:41,915
- You want me to hold him?
- Stay out of this... Why?

359
00:54:41,929 --> 00:54:46,200
- All you had to do was pull the trigger.
- Then Sybok would be dead.

360
00:54:46,233 --> 00:54:49,816
- I ordered you to defend your ship.
- And kill my brother.

361
00:54:50,046 --> 00:54:57,487
- A fellow Vulcan is not a...
- Sybok also is a son of Sarek.

362
00:54:57,487 --> 00:55:02,113
He's your brother brother?
You made that up.

363
00:55:02,158 --> 00:55:07,464
- I did not.
- You don't have a brother.

364
00:55:07,464 --> 00:55:11,947
- Technically I don't have a brother.
- See?

365
00:55:11,968 --> 00:55:17,354
- I have a half-brother.
- I've got to sit down.

366
00:55:19,542 --> 00:55:23,991
You and Sybok have the same father
but different mothers?

367
00:55:24,013 --> 00:55:30,920
Sybok's mother was a Vulcan princess,
but we were raised as brothers.

368
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:38,395
- Why didn't you tell us this before?
- It is a personal matter.

369
00:55:38,395 --> 00:55:43,294
- For that I am sorry.
- That makes everything all right. Sorry!

370
00:55:43,299 --> 00:55:47,606
Spock could no more kill
his own brother than he could kill you.

371
00:55:47,637 --> 00:55:53,610
He's already in the brig. Besides,
we've got bigger problems to deal with.

372
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:56,730
Like how do we get out of here.

373
00:55:56,813 --> 00:56:00,491
I'll say one thing,
you never cease to amaze me.

374
00:56:00,583 --> 00:56:04,023
Nor I myself.

375
00:56:09,325 --> 00:56:16,066
- I was beginning to worry.
- It's all right. Sybok will explain.

376
00:56:16,066 --> 00:56:19,920
- What are you doing?
- Plotting our new course.

377
00:56:19,969 --> 00:56:22,851
You have no authority.

378
00:56:26,157 --> 00:56:32,559
- What's going on here?
- Pavel, listen to this man.

379
00:56:32,664 --> 00:56:36,970
- I don't understand.
- Each of us hides a secret pain.

380
00:56:37,035 --> 00:56:42,041
Share yours with me
and gain strength from the sharing.

381
00:56:58,356 --> 00:57:01,061
Useless.

382
00:57:06,931 --> 00:57:10,027
Unwise.

383
00:57:17,575 --> 00:57:21,953
You could have warned me.
There's got to be a way out.

384
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:26,950
- This new brig is escape-proof.
- How do you know?

385
00:57:26,951 --> 00:57:32,690
The designers tested it using the most
intelligent person they could find.

386
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:37,518
- He failed to escape.
- Did this person have pointed ears?

387
00:57:37,528 --> 00:57:44,301
And an unerring capacity
for getting his shipmates into trouble?

388
00:57:45,435 --> 00:57:47,060
He did have pointed ears.

389
00:57:52,277 --> 00:57:58,529
- Following new course. Warp 7.
- Arrival in 6.7 hours at present speed.

390
00:58:00,752 --> 00:58:05,687
Now that we're underway, I'll announce
my intentions to the rest of the ship.

391
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:12,997
<i>Brave crew of the starship Enterprise,</i>
<i>consider the questions of existence.</i>

392
00:58:12,997 --> 00:58:20,204
Questions that man has asked since
he first gazed at the stars and dreamed.

393
00:58:20,204 --> 00:58:24,545
<i>My Vulcan ancestors</i>
<i>were ruled by their emotions.</i>

394
00:58:24,575 --> 00:58:27,492
<i>They felt with their hearts.</i>

395
00:58:27,578 --> 00:58:32,884
<i>They made love with their hearts.</i>
<i>They believed with their hearts.</i>

396
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:40,085
And they believed in a place where
these questions would be answered.

397
00:58:41,159 --> 00:58:44,943
Modern dogma tells us
this place is a myth.

398
00:58:44,996 --> 00:58:49,124
A fantasy concocted by pagans.

399
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:53,886
<i>It is no fantasy.</i>

400
00:58:53,938 --> 00:58:58,529
<i>I tell you... it exists.</i>

401
00:58:58,543 --> 00:59:02,706
My brothers, we have been chosen -

402
00:59:02,747 --> 00:59:08,252
- to undertake
the greatest adventure of all time.

403
00:59:08,252 --> 00:59:11,585
The discovery of Sha Ka Ree.

404
00:59:12,957 --> 00:59:19,597
Is it possible he's found Sha Ka Ree,
the reason he left Vulcan?

405
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:24,497
Our destination
is the planet Sha Ka Ree.

406
00:59:24,502 --> 00:59:27,871
It lies beyond the Great Barrier...

407
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:30,928
<i>... at the centre of the galaxy.</i>

408
00:59:31,009 --> 00:59:35,979
- The centre of the galaxy?
- Where it is fabled to exist.

409
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:41,552
The centre of the galaxy
can't be reached by any ship.

410
00:59:41,552 --> 00:59:44,850
Sybok possessed the keenest intellect
I've ever known.

411
00:59:44,922 --> 00:59:49,548
When I get the ship back,
and Sybok is in here...

412
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:54,281
you can debate Sha Ka Ree
until you're green in the face.

413
00:59:54,332 --> 00:59:57,321
You're either with me or you're not.

414
00:59:57,402 --> 01:00:01,993
- I am here, Captain.
- That's a little vague, Spock.

415
01:00:04,342 --> 01:00:07,438
What's that noise?

416
01:00:09,213 --> 01:00:13,768
It's a primitive form of communication
known as Morse code.

417
01:00:13,785 --> 01:00:18,056
You're right. I'm out of practice.
That's an S.

418
01:00:18,089 --> 01:00:21,423
- T...
- A...

419
01:00:21,459 --> 01:00:24,341
N... D... End of word.

420
01:00:24,429 --> 01:00:26,576
- Stand.
- New word.

421
01:00:26,731 --> 01:00:31,002
B... A...

422
01:00:31,069 --> 01:00:34,165
C... K...

423
01:00:34,238 --> 01:00:37,333
- Back.
- Stand back!

424
01:00:42,045 --> 01:00:45,972
What are you standing around for?
This is a jailbreak.

425
01:00:47,485 --> 01:00:52,207
These three are strong.
This will be quite a challenge.

426
01:00:53,491 --> 01:00:55,958
We've got to find them.

427
01:00:56,059 --> 01:00:59,950
- We can't trust anyone.
- We can send a distress signal.

428
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:04,587
There is an emergency sending
apparatus in the observation room.

429
01:01:04,602 --> 01:01:09,907
You might be able to reach it
by means of turbo-shaft 3.

430
01:01:09,907 --> 01:01:14,806
- It's a long and dangerous climb.
- Some of us get off on that.

431
01:01:14,811 --> 01:01:18,631
Get the transporter working
and contact a rescue ship.

432
01:01:18,683 --> 01:01:23,988
- Which way to the turbo-shaft?
- Down that tunnel and turn right.

433
01:01:23,988 --> 01:01:27,535
- You can't miss it.
- Mr Scott, you're amazing.

434
01:01:27,592 --> 01:01:32,349
I know this ship
like the back of my hand.

435
01:01:39,937 --> 01:01:45,915
- We'll get a good workout.
- Yeah, or a heart attack.

436
01:02:07,030 --> 01:02:10,186
Get Mr Scott to sick bay.

437
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:39,271
This is going to take me forever.

438
01:02:45,435 --> 01:02:48,531
Where's Spock?

439
01:02:51,008 --> 01:02:54,269
I believe I've found a faster way.

440
01:03:05,822 --> 01:03:10,928
- Bones?
- I'll wait for the next car.

441
01:03:10,928 --> 01:03:14,023
We're not splitting up.

442
01:03:19,303 --> 01:03:22,220
- We're too heavy.
- It must be the marsh melons.

443
01:03:24,875 --> 01:03:30,348
- Spock, the booster rockets.
- I can't control their power.

444
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:33,574
Fire the rockets.

445
01:03:33,651 --> 01:03:36,771
Captain, please come back down.

446
01:03:40,558 --> 01:03:43,440
Hit the brakes.

447
01:03:48,366 --> 01:03:53,017
- I overshot the mark by one level.
- Nobody's perfect.

448
01:04:04,215 --> 01:04:06,682
Spock.

449
01:04:08,753 --> 01:04:10,971
Emergency channel open.

450
01:04:11,088 --> 01:04:15,951
To anyone within range,
this is Captain James T. Kirk.

451
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:19,507
If you read me, acknowledge.

452
01:04:19,597 --> 01:04:22,444
Acknowledge.

453
01:04:22,566 --> 01:04:27,157
<i>This is Starfleet Command,</i>
<i>we read you. Over.</i>

454
01:04:27,170 --> 01:04:33,443
A hostile force
has taken control of our vessel.

455
01:04:33,443 --> 01:04:40,817
Our coordinates are 000.2.
Request emergency assistance.

456
01:04:40,817 --> 01:04:45,574
Understood Enterprise, we are
dispatching a rescue ship immediately.

457
01:05:01,138 --> 01:05:07,178
- I trust your message was received.
- You can't expect us to stand by.

458
01:05:07,178 --> 01:05:10,583
What you fear is the unknown.

459
01:05:12,249 --> 01:05:17,355
The people of your planet
once believed their world was flat.

460
01:05:17,355 --> 01:05:20,938
Columbus proved it was round.

461
01:05:20,991 --> 01:05:26,341
They said the sound barrier
could never be broken. It was broken.

462
01:05:26,364 --> 01:05:31,768
They said warp speed
could not be achieved.

463
01:05:31,768 --> 01:05:37,441
The Great Barrier is the ultimate
expression of this universal fear.

464
01:05:37,441 --> 01:05:40,702
It is an extension of personal fear.

465
01:05:40,777 --> 01:05:44,882
Captain Kirk, I so much
want your understanding.

466
01:05:44,915 --> 01:05:49,636
I want your respect.
Are you afraid to hear me out?

467
01:05:49,653 --> 01:05:54,588
- I'm afraid of nothing.
- Wait outside.

468
01:06:02,533 --> 01:06:05,273
I'm sure you have many questions.

469
01:06:05,403 --> 01:06:09,922
Here, amidst the stars
of our own galaxy...

470
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:14,875
we shall seek the answers
together.

471
01:06:21,218 --> 01:06:26,657
Easy, Scotty.
You're back with us.

472
01:06:26,657 --> 01:06:30,963
I dreamt that a madman
had taken over the Enterprise.

473
01:06:30,995 --> 01:06:35,930
- He's not a madman.
- He's not?

474
01:06:35,966 --> 01:06:42,706
Sybok has put us in touch with feelings
we've always been afraid to express.

475
01:06:42,706 --> 01:06:46,905
- I have to get to the transporter.
- Scotty!

476
01:06:46,944 --> 01:06:53,684
- There's so much I want to tell you.
- Wait till I'm a wee bit stronger.

477
01:06:53,684 --> 01:07:00,327
I don't think I could take it
in my present condition... or yours.

478
01:07:02,526 --> 01:07:07,733
Sha Ka Ree.
The Source.

479
01:07:07,764 --> 01:07:10,469
Heaven.

480
01:07:10,601 --> 01:07:14,040
Eden.
Call it what you will.

481
01:07:14,104 --> 01:07:17,200
The Klingons call it Qui Tu.

482
01:07:17,274 --> 01:07:23,046
The Romulans, Vorta Vor.
In Andorian it is unpronounceable.

483
01:07:23,046 --> 01:07:26,830
Still, every culture shares
this common dream.

484
01:07:26,884 --> 01:07:32,055
A place from which creation sprang.
For us it will soon be reality.

485
01:07:32,055 --> 01:07:36,183
My only reality is that
I'm a prisoner on my own ship.

486
01:07:36,227 --> 01:07:40,675
What is this power you have
to control the minds of my crew?

487
01:07:40,731 --> 01:07:44,408
I don't control minds... I free them.

488
01:07:48,171 --> 01:07:50,568
How?

489
01:07:51,475 --> 01:07:56,614
By making you face your pain
and draw strength from it.

490
01:07:56,614 --> 01:07:59,876
Once that's done, fear cannot stop you.

491
01:08:06,357 --> 01:08:10,735
It sounds like brainwashing to me.

492
01:08:10,761 --> 01:08:14,022
Your pain is the deepest of all.

493
01:08:14,131 --> 01:08:16,704
I can feel it, can't you?

494
01:08:18,035 --> 01:08:20,608
<i>Leonard.</i>

495
01:08:29,246 --> 01:08:33,065
This is some kind of trick.

496
01:08:33,817 --> 01:08:36,877
<i>Leonard.</i>

497
01:08:38,088 --> 01:08:43,493
Father?
My God! Don't do this to me.

498
01:08:43,493 --> 01:08:46,234
<i>Leonard.</i>

499
01:08:56,974 --> 01:09:00,864
I'm here. I'm with you, Dad.

500
01:09:01,879 --> 01:09:06,220
The pain. Stop the pain.

501
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:11,529
I've done everything I can do.
You've got to hang on.

502
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:15,544
I can't stand the pain.

503
01:09:15,626 --> 01:09:18,199
Help me.

504
01:09:19,696 --> 01:09:22,401
All my knowledge and I can't save him.

505
01:09:23,601 --> 01:09:28,749
You've done all you can.
The support system will keep him alive.

506
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:36,496
- You call this alive?
- Son...

507
01:09:38,015 --> 01:09:43,092
- Release me.
- I can't do that, Dad.

508
01:09:44,421 --> 01:09:48,692
But how can I watch him suffer
like this?

509
01:09:48,725 --> 01:09:51,750
You're a doctor.

510
01:09:58,835 --> 01:10:01,611
I'm his son.

511
01:11:05,269 --> 01:11:08,364
Why did you do it?

512
01:11:11,375 --> 01:11:16,025
To preserve his dignity.

513
01:11:19,816 --> 01:11:23,671
- That wasn't the worst of it, was it?
- No!

514
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:26,117
Share it.

515
01:11:26,223 --> 01:11:30,909
Not long after, they found a cure.
A goddamn cure.

516
01:11:30,928 --> 01:11:35,234
- If you didn't kill him, he'd have lived.
- I released him!

517
01:11:35,299 --> 01:11:38,976
- You did what you thought was right.
- Yes! No!

518
01:11:39,069 --> 01:11:42,473
Release this pain!

519
01:11:42,539 --> 01:11:46,667
This pain has poisoned your soul
for a long time.

520
01:11:48,812 --> 01:11:52,632
Now you've taken the first step.

521
01:11:52,683 --> 01:11:56,431
The other steps we'll take together.

522
01:12:02,759 --> 01:12:06,235
Each man's pain is unique.

523
01:12:06,330 --> 01:12:09,425
I hide no pain.

524
01:12:12,269 --> 01:12:16,124
- I know you better than that.
- Do you?

525
01:12:16,173 --> 01:12:20,301
- Spock, don't.
- It's all right, Captain.

526
01:12:20,978 --> 01:12:23,753
Proceed.

527
01:12:28,085 --> 01:12:32,604
- What is this?
- I believe we are witnessing my birth.

528
01:13:08,425 --> 01:13:11,723
Sarek, your son.

529
01:13:14,463 --> 01:13:17,453
So human.

530
01:13:22,172 --> 01:13:25,268
Spock?

531
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:47,951
- What have you done to my friends?
- Nothing. This is who they are.

532
01:13:47,998 --> 01:13:52,969
- Didn't you know that?
- No, I didn't.

533
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:56,552
- Now learn something about yourself.
- No, I refuse.

534
01:13:56,640 --> 01:14:01,088
- Jim, try to be open about this.
- About what?

535
01:14:02,446 --> 01:14:07,484
How I made wrong choices in my life?
Turning left instead of right?

536
01:14:07,484 --> 01:14:12,075
I don't need Sybok to take me
on a tour of my weaknesses.

537
01:14:12,089 --> 01:14:16,016
To be brainwashed by a conman!

538
01:14:16,059 --> 01:14:22,566
- This conman took away my pain.
- With the wave of a magic wand?

539
01:14:22,566 --> 01:14:26,694
The things we carry with us
make us who we are.

540
01:14:26,770 --> 01:14:29,996
If we lose them, we lose ourselves.

541
01:14:30,072 --> 01:14:36,609
I don't want my pain taken away.
I need my pain.

542
01:14:37,981 --> 01:14:43,402
Captain, you remain here.
Spock, Dr McCoy, come with me.

543
01:14:44,888 --> 01:14:48,708
- Spock?
- I cannot go with you.

544
01:14:48,759 --> 01:14:53,207
- Why not?
- I belong here.

545
01:14:53,263 --> 01:14:56,809
- I don't understand.
- Sybok...

546
01:14:56,867 --> 01:15:00,307
You are my brother,
but you do not know me.

547
01:15:00,370 --> 01:15:05,676
I am not the outcast boy
you left behind many years ago.

548
01:15:05,676 --> 01:15:10,846
I found myself and my place,
and I know who I am.

549
01:15:10,846 --> 01:15:14,108
I cannot go with you.

550
01:15:19,323 --> 01:15:22,584
You'd better count me out, too.

551
01:15:25,362 --> 01:15:29,431
- Then I'll see you on the other side.
- Wait!

552
01:15:31,301 --> 01:15:34,457
We'll never make it
through the Great Barrier.

553
01:15:34,571 --> 01:15:40,744
If we do, will that convince you
that my vision was true?

554
01:15:40,744 --> 01:15:45,644
It was given to me by God.
He waits for us on the other side.

555
01:15:47,617 --> 01:15:50,048
You are mad.

556
01:15:52,990 --> 01:15:55,243
Am I?

557
01:15:56,792 --> 01:15:59,189
We'll see.

558
01:16:24,788 --> 01:16:27,742
They say no ship can survive this.

559
01:16:27,823 --> 01:16:30,813
They're wrong. Danger is an illusion.

560
01:16:30,894 --> 01:16:34,156
We have no instrument readings.

561
01:16:34,264 --> 01:16:39,507
- Mr Sulu, full ahead.
- Full ahead, aye.

562
01:17:36,827 --> 01:17:41,204
- Is it possible?
- Fascinating.

563
01:17:43,033 --> 01:17:46,616
Are we dreaming?

564
01:17:47,838 --> 01:17:51,942
If we are, then life is a dream.

565
01:18:18,834 --> 01:18:21,954
Instruments are back on line.

566
01:18:22,706 --> 01:18:24,758
Incredible.

567
01:18:24,875 --> 01:18:30,960
There is a power source emanating
from the planet like nothing I've seen.

568
01:18:35,785 --> 01:18:39,260
- Sha Ka Ree.
- Qui Tu.

569
01:18:39,322 --> 01:18:42,097
Vorta Vor.

570
01:18:42,192 --> 01:18:44,695
Eden.

571
01:18:57,040 --> 01:19:00,374
- About the ship...
- The ship needs its captain.

572
01:19:00,443 --> 01:19:04,156
- No special conditions?
- No conditions.

573
01:19:06,816 --> 01:19:12,545
- I could turn us around.
- No, you too must know.

574
01:19:16,593 --> 01:19:21,006
Well, if we're going to do it,
we're going to do it by the book.

575
01:19:21,064 --> 01:19:26,794
Standard orbital approach.
Alert the shuttlecraft to stand by.

576
01:19:26,802 --> 01:19:30,930
Sybok, Spock, McCoy, come with me.
The rest of you remain on board.

577
01:19:31,007 --> 01:19:35,278
Until I determine
what we're dealing with.

578
01:19:35,312 --> 01:19:39,725
Don't just stand there,
God's a busy man.

579
01:20:28,864 --> 01:20:33,420
I am no longer in control of the craft.

580
01:21:07,971 --> 01:21:11,684
All right, we'll play it your way.

581
01:21:44,106 --> 01:21:48,757
It's amazing. The land. The sky.

582
01:21:48,778 --> 01:21:51,838
Just as I knew it would be.

583
01:22:37,327 --> 01:22:40,968
- You have to see this.
- I don't have time.

584
01:22:41,063 --> 01:22:46,271
The Captain told me
to get the transporter working.

585
01:24:19,295 --> 01:24:22,664
We have travelled far.

586
01:24:26,936 --> 01:24:30,056
By starship.

587
01:24:37,213 --> 01:24:40,926
Enterprise, this is Kirk.

588
01:24:42,318 --> 01:24:45,094
We have...

589
01:24:55,097 --> 01:24:57,802
Sybok.

590
01:25:00,270 --> 01:25:02,737
Perhaps...

591
01:27:17,773 --> 01:27:23,444
Brave souls, welcome.

592
01:27:29,819 --> 01:27:32,594
Is this the voice of God?

593
01:27:32,689 --> 01:27:37,802
One voice, many faces.

594
01:27:49,572 --> 01:27:53,213
Does this better
suit your expectations?

595
01:28:08,391 --> 01:28:12,697
- <i>Qual se tu?</i>
- It is I.

596
01:28:12,728 --> 01:28:17,106
Your journey
could not have been an easy one.

597
01:28:17,166 --> 01:28:20,571
It was not.
We had to breach the Barrier.

598
01:28:20,636 --> 01:28:27,209
Magnificent.
You are the first to find me.

599
01:28:27,209 --> 01:28:34,083
- We sought only your infinite wisdom.
- How did you breach the Barrier?

600
01:28:34,083 --> 01:28:38,425
- With a starship.
- This starship...

601
01:28:38,454 --> 01:28:44,460
Could it carry my wisdom
beyond the Barrier?

602
01:28:44,460 --> 01:28:49,111
- It could, yes.
- Then I shall make use of it.

603
01:28:49,165 --> 01:28:53,127
- It will be your chariot.
- Excuse me...

604
01:28:53,169 --> 01:29:00,465
- I will reach every corner of creation.
- I'd like to ask a question.

605
01:29:01,978 --> 01:29:07,617
- What does God need with a starship?
- Bring the ship closer.

606
01:29:07,617 --> 01:29:12,516
What does God need with a starship?

607
01:29:12,521 --> 01:29:15,997
- What are you doing?
- Asking a question.

608
01:29:16,058 --> 01:29:22,031
- Who is this creature?
- Don't you know? Aren't you God?

609
01:29:22,031 --> 01:29:27,725
- He has his doubts.
- You doubt me?

610
01:29:27,737 --> 01:29:33,776
- I seek proof.
- You don't ask the Almighty for his ID.

611
01:29:33,776 --> 01:29:36,872
Then here is the proof you seek.

612
01:29:48,791 --> 01:29:54,212
- Why is God angry?
- Why have you done this?

613
01:29:54,230 --> 01:29:58,334
- He doubts me.
- You have not answered his question.

614
01:29:58,401 --> 01:30:01,591
What does God need with a starship?

615
01:30:10,212 --> 01:30:13,795
Do you doubt me?

616
01:30:17,587 --> 01:30:24,360
I doubt any god who inflicts pain
for his own pleasure.

617
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:28,488
Stop! The god of Sha Ka Ree
would not do this.

618
01:30:28,564 --> 01:30:35,243
Sha Ka Ree? A vision you created.

619
01:30:38,007 --> 01:30:43,613
An eternity I've been
imprisoned in this place.

620
01:30:43,613 --> 01:30:49,218
The ship. I must have the ship.

621
01:30:49,218 --> 01:30:54,323
Now... give me what I want.

622
01:30:54,323 --> 01:30:56,506
Sybok...

623
01:30:56,626 --> 01:31:01,276
This is not the god of Sha Ka Ree,
or any other god.

624
01:31:01,330 --> 01:31:05,434
I don't understand.
Reveal yourself to me.

625
01:31:13,342 --> 01:31:16,782
What's wrong?
Don't you like this face?

626
01:31:16,846 --> 01:31:21,816
I have so many,
but this one suits you best.

627
01:31:21,816 --> 01:31:26,015
No, it's not possible.

628
01:31:26,055 --> 01:31:29,696
Bring me the ship
or I will destroy you.

629
01:31:29,759 --> 01:31:34,207
- The ship.
- Bring it closer...

630
01:31:34,263 --> 01:31:39,302
...so that I might join with it.

631
01:31:39,302 --> 01:31:47,343
Do it, or watch these puny things -

632
01:31:47,343 --> 01:31:50,260
- die horribly.

633
01:31:54,083 --> 01:31:58,152
- What have I done?
- Enterprise, listen carefully.

634
01:31:58,187 --> 01:32:02,909
This is my doing. This is my arrogance.
My vanity.

635
01:32:02,925 --> 01:32:06,603
- Sybok, we must find a way...
- No, save yourselves.

636
01:32:06,696 --> 01:32:09,507
Forgive me, brother.

637
01:32:15,236 --> 01:32:18,012
I couldn't help but notice your pain.

638
01:32:18,107 --> 01:32:22,105
It runs deep. Share it with me.

639
01:32:25,014 --> 01:32:29,640
- Enterprise, are you ready?
- Torpedo armed.

640
01:32:29,652 --> 01:32:33,994
- We're firing on your position.
- Send it down now!

641
01:32:42,797 --> 01:32:44,849
Run!

642
01:33:01,851 --> 01:33:04,662
Sybok...

643
01:33:10,326 --> 01:33:13,446
Let's get out of here.

644
01:33:14,730 --> 01:33:17,886
Sulu, I've lost them.

645
01:33:44,193 --> 01:33:47,455
Spock, get us out of here.

646
01:33:57,573 --> 01:34:00,978
Thrusters are inoperative.

647
01:34:15,256 --> 01:34:20,227
Mr Scott, please tell me
the transporter is working.

648
01:34:20,229 --> 01:34:23,219
I might be able to beam up two of you.

649
01:34:23,332 --> 01:34:27,983
- Beam up Spock and Dr McCoy now.
- Just a damn minute!

650
01:34:32,975 --> 01:34:35,336
Bring up the Captain.

651
01:35:00,803 --> 01:35:05,908
- We can't just leave Jim down there.
- Get a grip on yourself. Status report.

652
01:35:05,908 --> 01:35:10,285
The Klingon captain
wishes to name his terms.

653
01:35:10,312 --> 01:35:14,546
<i>This is Captain Klaa</i>
<i>of the Klingon Empire.</i>

654
01:35:14,582 --> 01:35:19,655
<i>Do not attempt to arm your weapons</i>
<i>or I will destroy you.</i>

655
01:35:19,655 --> 01:35:26,562
<i>You are alive for a single reason:</i>
<i>The renegade James T. Kirk.</i>

656
01:35:26,562 --> 01:35:30,833
<i>Hand him over</i>
<i>and I will spare your lives.</i>

657
01:35:30,900 --> 01:35:35,763
- <i>I'm ready to beam him aboard.</i>
- Captain Kirk is not among us.

658
01:35:35,770 --> 01:35:41,310
- <i>You lie.</i>
- Vulcans are incapable of lying.

659
01:35:41,310 --> 01:35:46,138
- Captain Kirk is on the planet below.
- <i>Then give me his coordinates.</i>

660
01:35:50,553 --> 01:35:55,523
- I am in need of your assistance.
- My assistance?

661
01:35:55,523 --> 01:36:00,351
- You are his superior officer.
- I am a foolish old man.

662
01:36:00,362 --> 01:36:03,695
Damn you, sir. You will try.

663
01:36:10,773 --> 01:36:14,356
<i>Klingon commander,</i>
<i>someone wishes to speak with you.</i>

664
01:37:03,392 --> 01:37:06,583
So it's me you want, you bastards.

665
01:37:07,495 --> 01:37:10,722
What are you waiting for?

666
01:37:34,690 --> 01:37:37,323
Release him.

667
01:37:37,426 --> 01:37:43,642
My junior officer has something
he wants to say to you.

668
01:37:46,568 --> 01:37:50,495
I... apologise.

669
01:37:57,880 --> 01:38:03,419
The attack upon your vessel
was not authorised by my government.

670
01:38:03,419 --> 01:38:11,557
Now, may I present
our new gunner.

671
01:38:20,302 --> 01:38:26,625
- Spock!
- Welcome aboard, Captain.

672
01:38:33,114 --> 01:38:36,934
I thought I was going to die.

673
01:38:36,985 --> 01:38:40,354
Not possible, you were never alone.

674
01:38:45,627 --> 01:38:49,933
Please, Captain,
not in front of the Klingons.

675
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:14,365
Would you care for
a wee nip of Scotch whiskey?

676
01:39:16,257 --> 01:39:19,591
I never thought
I'd be drinking with a Klingon.

677
01:39:19,661 --> 01:39:27,407
- What are you two conspiring about?
- About the progress we've made.

678
01:39:31,439 --> 01:39:34,737
She has wonderful muscles.

679
01:39:51,226 --> 01:39:54,346
Cosmic thoughts, gentlemen?

680
01:39:54,462 --> 01:39:59,954
We were speculating...
Is God really out there?

681
01:40:02,237 --> 01:40:05,606
Maybe he's not out there.

682
01:40:05,674 --> 01:40:10,537
Maybe he's right here
in the human heart.

683
01:40:13,615 --> 01:40:18,372
- Spock?
- I was thinking of Sybok.

684
01:40:18,387 --> 01:40:23,702
- I have lost a brother.
- Yes.

685
01:40:25,694 --> 01:40:30,177
I lost a brother, once.

686
01:40:30,231 --> 01:40:33,327
I was lucky. I got him back.

687
01:40:35,204 --> 01:40:38,917
I thought you said
men like us don't have families.

688
01:40:42,578 --> 01:40:44,452
I was wrong.

689
01:41:04,299 --> 01:41:09,827
Are you just going to pluck that thing,
or are you going to play something?

690
01:41:16,144 --> 01:41:19,478
<i>Row, row, row your boat</i>

691
01:41:19,547 --> 01:41:23,130
<i>gently down the stream</i>

692
01:41:23,184 --> 01:41:26,553
<i>merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily</i>
