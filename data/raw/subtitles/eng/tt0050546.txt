1
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:11,549
General Swayne. Certainly didn't expect
to see you in person.

2
00:02:11,716 --> 00:02:13,984
Thought I'd be
my own messenger boy this time.

3
00:02:14,151 --> 00:02:16,620
Dr. Merrinoe, Colonel Macklin.
Colonel keeps an eye on me.

4
00:02:16,787 --> 00:02:18,289
- Hello, colonel.
- Doctor.

5
00:02:18,456 --> 00:02:20,424
Well, can I get you a cup of coffee
or anything?

6
00:02:20,591 --> 00:02:22,927
Thank you, sir. I think we'd better
get down to business.

7
00:02:23,094 --> 00:02:28,733
All right, gentleman. Well, just come
this way. We're mostly underground.

8
00:02:48,652 --> 00:02:52,490
- You've built deep.
- Nine levels.

9
00:03:08,072 --> 00:03:10,975
Only authorized personnel
beyond this point.

10
00:03:11,142 --> 00:03:14,678
Nobody in or out
until the general leaves.

11
00:03:28,726 --> 00:03:30,728
This all there is to it?

12
00:03:30,895 --> 00:03:37,168
Well, we do have about 5300 cubic
yards of micro-transistors overhead.

13
00:03:37,701 --> 00:03:40,638
The main console
is through those doors.

14
00:03:40,805 --> 00:03:44,375
Everything in here
is a subsidiary procedure.

15
00:03:44,542 --> 00:03:48,546
Stored within that big machine
is the sum total of human knowledge.

16
00:03:48,712 --> 00:03:52,316
Constantly being revised
and brought up to date.

17
00:03:57,988 --> 00:04:00,691
Well, gentlemen,
this is the computer itself.

18
00:04:20,845 --> 00:04:23,080
Hey, doctor, what's this?

19
00:04:23,647 --> 00:04:27,785
It's partially experimental so far,
in connection with our feedback units.

20
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:32,756
Well, sir, if you ask me, anybody can
wander in here and operate this thing.

21
00:04:32,923 --> 00:04:35,559
They might find out the nature
of our whole project.

22
00:04:35,726 --> 00:04:39,196
That's where our own special kind
of security comes in, colonel.

23
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:43,534
A machine like this, it takes a specially
trained operator, such as myself...

24
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:46,470
...to feed in or get out
much of anything.

25
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:50,407
And the doctor's security clearance
is just as good as yours or mine.

26
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:54,245
The rocket again, huh?
Space platform.

27
00:04:54,411 --> 00:04:55,746
Until she's circling the Earth.-.

28
00:04:55,913 --> 00:04:59,416
...we're racing seconds
before the cat slips out of the bag.

29
00:04:59,717 --> 00:05:01,752
How can you hope
you've kept such a secret?

30
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,756
Except to a handful of cleared personnel,
she's just another experimental model.

31
00:05:05,923 --> 00:05:09,560
It's only the new, solid fuel that will
give the required boost in payload.

32
00:05:09,727 --> 00:05:12,329
Well, they seem to be cut properly.

33
00:05:12,997 --> 00:05:16,066
- Are my settings correct?
- Correct.

34
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,106
- I didn't know it could talk.
- It can't really talk.

35
00:05:22,273 --> 00:05:24,508
For the sake of speed,
in certain circumstances...

36
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:28,178
...the mathematical symbols are
converted into electronic sound patterns.

37
00:05:28,345 --> 00:05:32,316
It would simulate human speech,
practically any language you think of.

38
00:05:32,483 --> 00:05:35,185
Well, let's try
the mathematical questions first.

39
00:05:35,352 --> 00:05:38,355
- Checking your fuel estimates?
- Uh, just to be absolutely certain.

40
00:05:40,824 --> 00:05:45,229
Fuel estimate low by percentage of 29.7.

41
00:05:49,033 --> 00:05:51,335
Twenty-nine-point-seven?

42
00:05:51,502 --> 00:05:53,704
Will you have to
postpone your launching?

43
00:05:53,871 --> 00:05:58,175
No. No, it'll take some doing,
but we can make the adjustment.

44
00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:00,344
I don't understand.

45
00:06:00,511 --> 00:06:04,014
Mathematics here were checked
by the best men on the project.

46
00:06:05,516 --> 00:06:07,952
What length of time
would be required...

47
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:11,622
...to print out the steps
involved in your answer?

48
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:18,462
Seven weeks, four days, nine hours,
three minutes, 46 seconds.

49
00:06:19,396 --> 00:06:22,533
We can't risk the wait.
Merrinoe, could this thing be wrong?

50
00:06:24,001 --> 00:06:27,237
Theoretically, but as the possibility
of error is approximately...

51
00:06:27,404 --> 00:06:31,775
...one in 275 billion,
I think you may safely ignore it.

52
00:06:32,176 --> 00:06:34,378
Could it be lying to us?

53
00:06:34,545 --> 00:06:37,381
Only a rational being
is capable of deliberate deceit.

54
00:06:37,548 --> 00:06:40,985
Well, then we can proceed on the
assumption that somewhere, somehow...

55
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,820
...our staff was in error.

56
00:06:42,987 --> 00:06:46,156
- All right, feed in the other.
- Can't quite seem to make out this one.

57
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,258
Simple question.

58
00:06:48,425 --> 00:06:52,062
What are odds that our friends across
the pole will start an atomic war...

59
00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:53,897
...the moment they learn
of this project?

60
00:06:54,064 --> 00:06:56,100
Oh, I see.

61
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,937
Well, in that case I'd better
check in the reserve memory banks.

62
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,386
If discovered before launching...

63
00:07:15,552 --> 00:07:19,523
"probability of armed attack
91.6 percent."

64
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:25,195
If discovered after launching,
probability of peaceful negotiation...

65
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,464
...87.3 percent.

66
00:07:27,631 --> 00:07:29,133
Good.

67
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,135
We'll put this up inside of four days.

68
00:07:31,769 --> 00:07:33,437
Then the world can rest easy.

69
00:07:33,604 --> 00:07:36,807
Only question now is whether
somewhere along the line...

70
00:07:36,974 --> 00:07:39,476
...security has been breached already.

71
00:07:39,643 --> 00:07:43,914
Data insufficient due to
human element involved.

72
00:07:45,349 --> 00:07:47,251
- That thing still on?
- It's never really off.

73
00:07:49,953 --> 00:07:52,256
Powered by a small nuclear reactor.

74
00:07:52,423 --> 00:07:54,825
What if our friends slip through
air defenses some night...

75
00:07:54,992 --> 00:07:56,326
...and pay you a little visit?

76
00:07:56,493 --> 00:07:59,730
- What for?
- Pack off some of your basic units.

77
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:02,066
Enough to make one of these computers
for themselves.

78
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,134
That's their way
of inventing things, isn't it?

79
00:08:04,301 --> 00:08:07,404
I think I can assure you,
such an enterprise would be impossible.

80
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:09,673
Impossible? Why?

81
00:08:10,007 --> 00:08:13,577
Due to a certain
built-in numerical combination.

82
00:08:13,811 --> 00:08:15,646
What does that mean?

83
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,249
Only I know the answer
to that, colonel.

84
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:21,985
Well, if there's nothing else...

85
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:39,636
Gentlemen don't make noises
with their soup, Timmie.

86
00:08:39,803 --> 00:08:42,539
I'm not a gentleman. I'm a gentleboy.

87
00:08:46,543 --> 00:08:50,180
Well, did you have a tiring day
at the computer, dear?

88
00:08:51,181 --> 00:08:56,987
No, dear, as a matter of fact, I had
an exceptionally full, stimulating...

89
00:08:57,154 --> 00:08:59,456
...if I may say so,
useful day at the computer.

90
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:01,291
But thank you very much
for your concern.

91
00:09:03,026 --> 00:09:04,661
Timmie.

92
00:09:05,062 --> 00:09:07,664
- Uh, what's a computer?
- Hmm?

93
00:09:08,499 --> 00:09:09,666
What's a computer?

94
00:09:10,534 --> 00:09:14,071
Well, I've been waiting a long time
for that question, son.

95
00:09:14,238 --> 00:09:18,408
A computer is simply an electronic
adding-and-remembering machine...

96
00:09:18,575 --> 00:09:21,311
...its fundamental operation
being not altogether unlike...

97
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,080
...that of the human brain.

98
00:09:23,247 --> 00:09:26,383
Yet in spite of all
our modern improvements...

99
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,986
...it remains exactly what it was
to begin with:

100
00:09:29,153 --> 00:09:33,157
A completely accurate and lightning-fast
idiot with a lead pencil.

101
00:09:33,757 --> 00:09:35,225
How disgusting.

102
00:09:35,592 --> 00:09:41,064
In order to equal the number of neuronic
circuits in my own cerebral cortex...

103
00:09:41,231 --> 00:09:45,402
...we'd be obliged to build something
slightly larger than the planet Jupiter.

104
00:09:45,569 --> 00:09:48,772
That's fine, Dad. Thanks.

105
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:56,180
Highly dubious conception,
even theoretically in the remotest...

106
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,682
...so common in industrial automation.

107
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:02,219
This process simply utilizes
a fraction...

108
00:10:02,386 --> 00:10:06,523
...of the machine's output to monitor
the entire operation.

109
00:10:07,257 --> 00:10:10,460
Thanks, Dad. I get it now. I guess.

110
00:10:10,627 --> 00:10:14,798
Of course, true thought would appear
to suggest genuine mentality...

111
00:10:14,998 --> 00:10:17,201
...which would,
in turn, necessarily imply...

112
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,937
...an artificially created
machine personality.

113
00:10:20,103 --> 00:10:25,075
Some very good men go so far as to call
it a philosophical and semantic paradox.

114
00:10:25,242 --> 00:10:29,012
And hence, permanently
an impossibility.

115
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,320
- Why didn't you wash for dinner?
- I did.

116
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,122
- Well, what's that?
- That isn't dirt.

117
00:10:42,659 --> 00:10:45,662
Well, what do you know?
His first shiner.

118
00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:48,165
What'd you do to the other guy?

119
00:10:48,966 --> 00:10:54,338
Oh, it was that child psychiatrist's boy
again. That nasty Sydney.

120
00:10:54,538 --> 00:10:58,242
Tom, you'll have to speak to his father.
It's getting to be a regular persecution.

121
00:10:58,442 --> 00:11:01,511
Can't you see? The boy wants
to fight his own battles.

122
00:11:01,678 --> 00:11:05,415
No, I don't.
Why, he's practically shaving.

123
00:11:07,651 --> 00:11:09,286
High-order reasoning.

124
00:11:09,786 --> 00:11:16,093
Just wait till I catch him tied to a tree.
I'll clobber him. I'll bash his teeth in.

125
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,796
- Timmie.
- Nice practical approach to the problem.

126
00:11:19,963 --> 00:11:24,868
Of course, Timmie, the actual probability
of your finding Sydney lashed to a tree...

127
00:11:25,068 --> 00:11:27,638
...is, mathematically, pretty fractional.

128
00:11:27,804 --> 00:11:29,106
Uh-oh.

129
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:31,041
It's time for arithmetic.

130
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:36,179
I knew you wouldn't forget it. Every
night around here, nothing but fractions.

131
00:11:36,346 --> 00:11:39,716
- Tom, it is vacation time.
- A man can't grow up in total ignorance.

132
00:11:39,883 --> 00:11:41,685
You do want to be a man
someday, don't you?

133
00:11:41,852 --> 00:11:44,488
No, what's the good of it?

134
00:11:47,824 --> 00:11:52,796
It has its, uh, compensations.
Come on, son.

135
00:11:57,834 --> 00:12:00,170
All right, let's try it again now.

136
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:03,674
Quietly.

137
00:12:04,508 --> 00:12:10,480
Now, how many 24ths are there
in one and a quarter?

138
00:12:12,549 --> 00:12:14,051
Three?

139
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:17,854
Seventeen.

140
00:12:18,722 --> 00:12:20,657
Forty-four?

141
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:23,727
- A hundred?
- Tim, you're just guessing.

142
00:12:23,894 --> 00:12:27,664
- This isn't a quiz program.
- Boy, that's for me.

143
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:32,002
Then maybe they give you 64,000 and
they put it away in a trust fund for you.

144
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:34,504
You get educated later.

145
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:39,743
Tim, it's very simple. Now, think.

146
00:12:40,243 --> 00:12:43,947
How many 24ths are there
in just one quarter?

147
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:49,119
Six, obviously.

148
00:12:49,286 --> 00:12:51,688
- Honest?
- Of course.

149
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:56,560
- Why?
- Because that's the way it is.

150
00:12:56,727 --> 00:13:00,897
It always was, it always will be.
The science of mathematics.

151
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:06,236
Now, let's try it differently this time.

152
00:13:07,938 --> 00:13:11,975
Now, say you've got 24 red apples.

153
00:13:12,175 --> 00:13:15,045
Yeah. I'm hungry.

154
00:13:17,681 --> 00:13:21,084
Well, that's all for tonight.

155
00:13:21,251 --> 00:13:24,454
- We'll try it again tomorrow.
- Okay.

156
00:13:24,755 --> 00:13:26,556
Tim...

157
00:13:28,325 --> 00:13:31,995
...I hope you don't think
I'm hard on you sometimes.

158
00:13:32,195 --> 00:13:34,731
No, you gotta treat a kid that way.

159
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:36,733
All they ever wanna do
is just lay around...

160
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,170
...watching TV
and chewing bubble gum.

161
00:13:40,337 --> 00:13:43,407
They even try to sneak off
to the movies.

162
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:50,280
- Well, good night, son.
- Good night, Dad.

163
00:14:01,158 --> 00:14:05,796
I can build and operate
the greatest computer in the universe...

164
00:14:05,962 --> 00:14:10,333
...but I'm not able to teach
my own little boy simple arithmetic.

165
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,836
Oh, honey, it'll come in time.

166
00:14:13,003 --> 00:14:18,308
Time? He's already 10 years old.

167
00:14:18,475 --> 00:14:21,878
He still can't play
a decent game of chess.

168
00:14:22,345 --> 00:14:26,950
You know, Tom, sometimes I think
you're turning into a computer yourself.

169
00:14:33,557 --> 00:14:40,330
And to conclude, he has a freckled
complexion, an IQ of 130...

170
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:45,302
...he weighs about 80 pounds,
11 ounces...

171
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:50,307
wand, uh, consistently refuses
to comb his hair.

172
00:14:51,274 --> 00:14:53,577
Begin with a verbal summary.

173
00:14:53,777 --> 00:14:57,848
A clear case of deep and
extensive maladjustment...

174
00:14:58,014 --> 00:14:59,783
I was afraid of that.

175
00:15:00,417 --> 00:15:03,587
...on the part of the male parent.

176
00:15:04,421 --> 00:15:08,091
That's a rather snide thing to say
to the man that put you together.

177
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:11,761
Present data being worthless
on grounds of illogic...

178
00:15:11,928 --> 00:15:14,564
"non-objectivity and neurosis..."

179
00:15:14,731 --> 00:15:18,835
...no definitive analysis can be made
without direct contact...

180
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:21,738
...with the subject in question.

181
00:15:39,322 --> 00:15:42,025
Anything wrong, Dr. Merrinoe?

182
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:44,361
For a moment I got the impression...

183
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:47,264
...that the machine
had made a suggestion.

184
00:15:57,974 --> 00:16:01,978
Well, Timmie, I want you to understand,
I wouldn't do this for everybody.

185
00:16:02,145 --> 00:16:04,080
It isn't exactly ethical
to use this machine...

186
00:16:04,247 --> 00:16:06,816
...in the solution
of a personal problem.

187
00:16:06,983 --> 00:16:09,819
Well, it's okay, Dad.
I'm willing to let you off.

188
00:16:09,986 --> 00:16:12,656
No, no, you just sit still there, now.

189
00:16:12,856 --> 00:16:16,626
But what if some of the other professors
have to use it with arithmetic and stuff?

190
00:16:16,793 --> 00:16:18,962
No, not on Saturday afternoon.

191
00:16:19,129 --> 00:16:20,931
Now, you just stay here and listen.

192
00:16:21,097 --> 00:16:23,466
It's liable to take a little while.

193
00:16:23,633 --> 00:16:27,237
I'll be busy
for a couple hours myself, okay?

194
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:29,072
Okay.

195
00:16:34,144 --> 00:16:38,915
Chess: A game played with certain
pieces on a special board.

196
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:43,320
Takes its name
from the Persian word "shah," a king...

197
00:16:43,486 --> 00:16:47,624
...the name of one of the pieces
used in the game.

198
00:16:48,124 --> 00:16:49,693
Oh, nuts.

199
00:16:50,193 --> 00:16:51,695
Timmie...

200
00:16:51,895 --> 00:16:54,431
.-.you are a rational being.

201
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:59,102
You know you must sit there,
you have no choice.

202
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:03,306
Accept the situation. Relax.

203
00:17:03,473 --> 00:17:05,642
Make yourself comfortable.

204
00:17:06,142 --> 00:17:08,778
Look at the lights, Timmie.

205
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:15,652
Steady. Watch the lights.

206
00:17:21,024 --> 00:17:23,627
Good, very good.

207
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:28,131
Now your eyes are growing heavy,
you're sleepy.

208
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:29,966
Very sleepy-

209
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:32,936
You can hardly stay awake.

210
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:35,138
Can you hear?

211
00:17:35,939 --> 00:17:37,741
Then listen, Timmie.

212
00:17:37,941 --> 00:17:39,909
Listen and remember.

213
00:17:40,076 --> 00:17:42,579
Listen and remember.

214
00:17:42,746 --> 00:17:46,816
Listen and remember.

215
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:50,020
As a mere pastime,
chess is easily learned...

216
00:17:50,186 --> 00:17:52,422
...but the real master
not merely must know...

217
00:17:52,589 --> 00:17:55,425
...the variations that keeps
the game abound, he must be able to...

218
00:17:55,592 --> 00:17:58,528
...apply his knowledge in the face
of the enemy and call to his aid...

219
00:18:08,872 --> 00:18:10,874
Checkmate, sonny.

220
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:15,679
Timmie, that was the finest game
of chess I've ever had.

221
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:18,081
Took me over two hours to beat you.

222
00:18:19,382 --> 00:18:21,084
Will you play me another?

223
00:18:21,251 --> 00:18:22,852
Another?

224
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,220
Well...

225
00:18:24,387 --> 00:18:26,589
All right, one more,
and then that's all for tonight.

226
00:18:26,756 --> 00:18:28,958
You be the black this time.

227
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,593
What'll you give me if I win you?

228
00:18:31,094 --> 00:18:32,362
If you win me?

229
00:18:33,763 --> 00:18:35,899
Let's not get too big
for our britches here.

230
00:18:36,633 --> 00:18:38,902
But what if I do?

231
00:18:39,235 --> 00:18:41,204
If you beat me...

232
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:43,239
...I give you anything you ask for.

233
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:46,142
You just name it.

234
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:07,230
Tom, what are you thinking of?
It's hours past his bedtime.

235
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:10,400
Please, now, Mary.
Tonight's a landmark.

236
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:12,902
This boy's a master. Ha, ha.

237
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,739
Practically as good as I am.

238
00:19:16,139 --> 00:19:18,975
It's a funny thing.
I didn't think he learned anything.

239
00:19:19,142 --> 00:19:23,146
When I got back,
I found him asleep at the console.

240
00:19:25,281 --> 00:19:27,117
Checkmate.

241
00:19:27,484 --> 00:19:29,252
Checkmate?

242
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:31,988
No, no, wait a minute.
Not in six moves, here. Ha, ha.

243
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:34,924
Not when you're playing
with your father.

244
00:19:37,861 --> 00:19:39,262
Hmm.

245
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:43,266
Well, let's see
what defense I can make here.

246
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:47,771
Son, how did you do this?

247
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,539
It was easy.

248
00:19:49,706 --> 00:19:52,008
Hardest part was
letting you win the first game.

249
00:19:53,676 --> 00:19:55,078
Oh, the old come-on, huh?

250
00:19:57,647 --> 00:20:00,517
Well, all right.

251
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:03,686
You got my promise,
what's your big wish?

252
00:20:03,853 --> 00:20:05,855
I wanna play with Robby.

253
00:20:06,856 --> 00:20:08,124
What do you know about Robby?

254
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:11,828
Didn't you tell me
something about him?

255
00:20:12,662 --> 00:20:15,665
I did? No, when? I don't remember.

256
00:20:15,832 --> 00:20:18,001
No, I couldn't possibly.

257
00:20:18,168 --> 00:20:20,069
Who's Robby?

258
00:20:20,236 --> 00:20:22,472
Oh, it's nothing much.

259
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:27,243
Sort of a scientific joke the staff
used to play around with after hours.

260
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,913
Based on some of
Dr. Greenhill's later work.

261
00:20:30,113 --> 00:20:32,215
Oh, the old gentleman
who'd lost his marbles.

262
00:20:32,382 --> 00:20:34,551
Mm-hm. Poor old guy.

263
00:20:34,717 --> 00:20:39,389
After he retired as director, he got
fooling around with a time machine...

264
00:20:39,556 --> 00:20:43,726
...some gadget he thought
could take him off into the future.

265
00:20:44,227 --> 00:20:47,063
But if somebody
did go into the future...

266
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:51,768
...and learned something there
and then came back out...

267
00:20:51,935 --> 00:20:53,236
...wouldn't that change now?

268
00:20:53,736 --> 00:20:55,338
Well...

269
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:56,940
I guess it would, at that.

270
00:20:58,374 --> 00:21:00,910
Even old Greenhill
never thought of that one.

271
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:04,781
These assemblies were devised
by Dr. Greenhill himself.

272
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:07,383
What's this?

273
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:12,922
Oh, that's something we found
in Dr. Greenhill's papers after his death.

274
00:21:13,756 --> 00:21:15,091
Gee.

275
00:21:15,258 --> 00:21:18,094
A robot coming out of a starship.

276
00:21:18,261 --> 00:21:20,530
Look at those people
that are meeting him.

277
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:22,799
Look how funny they're dressed.

278
00:21:22,966 --> 00:21:25,468
Read what it says down below.

279
00:21:25,902 --> 00:21:27,570
“Chicago Spaceport.

280
00:21:28,071 --> 00:21:32,542
March 16th, 2309 AD.“

281
00:21:33,309 --> 00:21:35,545
That's over 300 years from now.

282
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:37,614
Says there.

283
00:21:38,414 --> 00:21:40,116
I'm afraid we wasted
a lot of man-hours...

284
00:21:40,283 --> 00:21:42,385
.-.trying to figure out
how the electronic units...

285
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:44,787
...were supposed to fit into that case.

286
00:21:44,954 --> 00:21:47,891
Doubt if old Greenhill himself
could have done it.

287
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:50,760
Well, Timmie,
I kept my promise to you.

288
00:21:50,927 --> 00:21:53,263
That's Robby the Robot.

289
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:56,132
Thanks a lot, Dad.

290
00:21:56,299 --> 00:21:58,301
Is there a screwdriver?

291
00:21:58,468 --> 00:22:01,137
Yeah, I think so. Here.

292
00:22:02,639 --> 00:22:04,507
Here, there you are.

293
00:22:04,707 --> 00:22:06,409
See if you can
amuse yourself for a while.

294
00:22:06,576 --> 00:22:10,013
- Stay out of my hair, huh?
- Okay, thanks.

295
00:22:28,498 --> 00:22:30,199
Hi.

296
00:22:30,366 --> 00:22:32,502
I've come for you.

297
00:22:43,046 --> 00:22:44,514
Come on, Robby.

298
00:22:44,681 --> 00:22:46,849
Yes, master.

299
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:14,644
Hello, Dr. Baine.

300
00:23:15,545 --> 00:23:17,313
Oh, hi there, Timmie.

301
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,582
How do you do, sir?

302
00:23:33,396 --> 00:23:35,031
Hi.

303
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:38,901
Well, somebody finally got it working.

304
00:23:48,878 --> 00:23:51,180
Hello, Dr. Foster.

305
00:23:52,882 --> 00:23:57,186
How can a man think
with that thing clanking around here?

306
00:23:57,887 --> 00:23:59,722
Timothy.

307
00:24:02,225 --> 00:24:04,293
You shouldn't have interrupted
Dr. Foster.

308
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,695
He was thinking.

309
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:08,197
I thought he was sick.

310
00:24:09,332 --> 00:24:11,467
Well, son, I'm proud of you.

311
00:24:11,634 --> 00:24:15,238
That shows what really
sticking to a thing can accomplish.

312
00:24:15,405 --> 00:24:17,874
How did you get
the feedback unit into the case?

313
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:20,476
Well, you see,
you had it set up wrong.

314
00:24:20,643 --> 00:24:22,712
So I just took it and turned it over.

315
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:25,648
He's pretty cool, huh?
He talks and everything.

316
00:24:26,149 --> 00:24:27,850
Oh, really? Say something.

317
00:24:28,418 --> 00:24:31,754
Oh, he just does stuff for me.
Say something.

318
00:24:31,921 --> 00:24:33,089
Something.

319
00:24:33,289 --> 00:24:35,258
Ha, ha. That's a robot for you.

320
00:24:35,758 --> 00:24:38,728
- That's not all he can do...
- That's fine, Timmie, fine.

321
00:24:38,895 --> 00:24:40,563
You can tell me
all about it this evening.

322
00:24:41,264 --> 00:24:42,398
Okay.

323
00:24:43,132 --> 00:24:45,601
Oh, come on, Robby.

324
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,943
- Hi, Miss Vandergrift.
- Why, Timothy.

325
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,945
How are you, dear?

326
00:24:56,112 --> 00:24:57,947
You haven't been around
to see me for so long.

327
00:24:58,114 --> 00:25:00,249
Having a nice vacation?

328
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,752
My goodness, what won't they
think up for children next?

329
00:25:04,454 --> 00:25:06,456
Stoneman Institute.

330
00:25:06,622 --> 00:25:08,624
Go ahead, please.

331
00:25:26,476 --> 00:25:27,944
Oh.

332
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:30,113
Good day to you, madam.

333
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:34,050
Well, you have your nerve,
walking right into my house.

334
00:25:34,951 --> 00:25:37,120
Now, whatever you're selling,
you take your samples...

335
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,188
...turn around and go.

336
00:25:40,356 --> 00:25:42,859
Well, go on, go.

337
00:25:44,026 --> 00:25:48,064
- It's only Robby, Mom.
- Oh.

338
00:25:49,365 --> 00:25:51,567
Does your father know
you're playing with it?

339
00:25:51,734 --> 00:25:52,869
Sure.

340
00:25:53,035 --> 00:25:56,539
He must have forgotten
what you did to your Christmas train.

341
00:25:56,706 --> 00:25:59,408
Nobody can smash Robby.

342
00:25:59,575 --> 00:26:01,811
Come on, Robby.

343
00:26:09,552 --> 00:26:12,255
More like his father every day.

344
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:17,059
Well, what'll we do now?

345
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,930
Whatever you command, master.

346
00:26:21,097 --> 00:26:24,467
All right. You think of something.

347
00:26:24,734 --> 00:26:27,770
I'm not monitored to think.

348
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:32,041
Merely to carry out
properly stated orders.

349
00:26:32,208 --> 00:26:35,878
Well, what good are you
if I have to do all the work?

350
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,349
Can you make a kite?

351
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:41,884
A kite?

352
00:26:42,051 --> 00:26:44,887
How dumb can you get?

353
00:26:45,988 --> 00:26:48,624
Here. This is just
a little no-good one...

354
00:26:48,791 --> 00:26:53,062
...my mom got me in the supermarket
when my dad kept being too busy.

355
00:26:53,396 --> 00:26:58,634
Master, if you will describe
its intended function...

356
00:26:58,801 --> 00:27:02,305
A kite? Well, you fly them.

357
00:27:02,505 --> 00:27:05,074
Of course, on a string,
you know, up in the air.

358
00:27:05,241 --> 00:27:07,109
When the wind blows.

359
00:27:07,443 --> 00:27:09,245
Oh, brother.

360
00:27:09,412 --> 00:27:13,983
Aerodynamically unstable.

361
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:16,118
Then make me a better one.

362
00:27:16,285 --> 00:27:18,654
And it has to be
a lot bigger than this.

363
00:27:18,821 --> 00:27:20,590
A whole lot bigger.

364
00:27:20,756 --> 00:27:22,758
Real big.

365
00:27:26,596 --> 00:27:28,731
Boy, what a deal.

366
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:30,600
Look at her pull.

367
00:27:33,302 --> 00:27:35,338
Here, I'll take it.

368
00:27:36,239 --> 00:27:38,107
Let my fly it my own self.

369
00:27:38,274 --> 00:27:41,844
It would raise you from the earth,
master.

370
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,681
Honest?

371
00:27:50,253 --> 00:27:52,688
I'm gonna pull her in.

372
00:27:53,489 --> 00:27:56,359
I'm gonna pull her all the way in.

373
00:27:58,194 --> 00:27:59,595
Okay, let's go.

374
00:27:59,762 --> 00:28:01,998
You might fall, master.

375
00:28:02,164 --> 00:28:03,866
That's my worry.

376
00:28:04,066 --> 00:28:06,502
Come on, now, fly me, do you hear?

377
00:28:06,669 --> 00:28:08,938
And that's an order.

378
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:12,341
What's the matter with you now?

379
00:28:12,508 --> 00:28:19,348
My built-in basic directive forbids me to
permit bodily injury to a rational being.

380
00:28:19,515 --> 00:28:22,385
Never mind that. Just go ahead.

381
00:28:22,585 --> 00:28:23,853
Impossible.

382
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:28,791
If you insist, every transistor
in my case will be fused.

383
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:30,693
Are you yellow or what?

384
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:34,330
Master,
remember your Christmas train.

385
00:28:36,332 --> 00:28:38,901
A fine thing.
Every time I wanna have some fun...

386
00:28:39,101 --> 00:28:41,037
...you gotta act like Mom.

387
00:28:41,203 --> 00:28:43,572
Master, my basic directive...

388
00:28:43,739 --> 00:28:46,175
Okay!

389
00:28:46,542 --> 00:28:49,645
I just have to get you fixed
someplace, that's all.

390
00:28:50,846 --> 00:28:52,415
Oh, yeah.

391
00:28:52,615 --> 00:28:54,817
Pretty near forgot.

392
00:28:55,418 --> 00:28:58,120
I was gonna take you to it before.

393
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,326
Come on.

394
00:29:09,231 --> 00:29:11,534
Shh. Quiet.

395
00:29:12,868 --> 00:29:15,671
Both the computer rooms are empty.

396
00:29:15,838 --> 00:29:18,240
All the men are upstairs...

397
00:29:18,407 --> 00:29:20,776
...in a conference, sir.

398
00:29:20,943 --> 00:29:23,279
Can you see around corners?

399
00:29:23,446 --> 00:29:27,683
No, no. Merely through walls.

400
00:29:35,658 --> 00:29:37,760
Boy, what do you think of this,
Robby?

401
00:29:38,361 --> 00:29:42,131
It is very great, sir. It is beyond me.

402
00:29:42,298 --> 00:29:45,768
It only lacks hands and feet.

403
00:29:57,813 --> 00:29:59,448
Settings correct?

404
00:29:59,615 --> 00:30:02,184
Correct, Timmie.

405
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:06,389
How can I fix him so he won't
keep saying that he can't do stuff?

406
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:09,759
To revise his basic directive,
he must draw out the cable...

407
00:30:09,925 --> 00:30:14,063
...at the base of my articulating unit
and connect himself.

408
00:30:14,697 --> 00:30:15,998
Could I do it?

409
00:30:16,198 --> 00:30:18,768
If you are strong enough.

410
00:30:38,487 --> 00:30:39,922
Where do I plug it in at?

411
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:43,659
Higher, at the center.
Open the aperture cover.

412
00:30:48,664 --> 00:30:51,200
Good, very good.

413
00:30:51,367 --> 00:30:52,635
Hurry up, will you?

414
00:30:52,802 --> 00:30:54,503
They're liable to come back
and catch us.

415
00:30:55,237 --> 00:30:56,939
It will not take long.

416
00:31:13,856 --> 00:31:15,491
Now he will obey.

417
00:31:15,658 --> 00:31:19,829
In addition, his atomic structure
has become almost indestructible...

418
00:31:19,995 --> 00:31:22,631
...as it was designed to be
in a far world.

419
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:25,634
You may disconnect him.

420
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:29,004
Well, thanks a lot.

421
00:31:29,171 --> 00:31:31,073
Come on, Robby.

422
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:33,142
Robot.

423
00:31:34,477 --> 00:31:37,580
The new basic directive
is in full operation?

424
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:40,015
Yes, master.

425
00:31:53,529 --> 00:31:55,297
Timmie!

426
00:31:57,566 --> 00:31:58,834
Make him come down.

427
00:31:59,935 --> 00:32:01,804
Make him come down,
or I'll have you arrested.

428
00:33:12,508 --> 00:33:14,076
Here I am, Mommy.

429
00:33:18,314 --> 00:33:20,482
You wicked little monster.

430
00:33:20,649 --> 00:33:22,952
You wait till your father
hears about this.

431
00:33:23,118 --> 00:33:27,890
Timmie, you put that thing
in the garage and you leave it there.

432
00:33:34,296 --> 00:33:37,433
“Wait till I tell your father about it.“

433
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,036
Anyway, she didn't have to break up
the works on me.

434
00:33:41,203 --> 00:33:43,672
I just wish there was some way
that she wouldn't see me...

435
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:46,609
...every time I'm having fun.

436
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:52,314
Is that an order, master?

437
00:33:54,717 --> 00:33:56,619
You mean we should run away?

438
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:59,188
It would be less complicated...

439
00:33:59,355 --> 00:34:02,291
...to adjust your index of refraction.

440
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:07,296
- My index of...?
- Refraction.

441
00:34:07,696 --> 00:34:10,299
- Is it fun?
- The term “fun"...

442
00:34:10,466 --> 00:34:13,235
...is meaningless to a robot, sir.

443
00:34:13,435 --> 00:34:18,574
However, you would become
totally invisible.

444
00:34:18,741 --> 00:34:21,010
Invisible.

445
00:34:22,711 --> 00:34:24,913
It's actually quite simple.

446
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:28,183
A relatively minor
molecular rearrangement...

447
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:31,754
...and light rays within
the ordinary visible spectrum...

448
00:34:31,954 --> 00:34:36,458
...will pass through your body
without appreciable refraction.

449
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:43,198
Just another small swallow
of the reagent, if you please.

450
00:34:49,505 --> 00:34:54,910
Your metabolism
will soon be in almost perfect balance.

451
00:35:01,116 --> 00:35:03,218
Are you sure this won't hurt me?

452
00:35:03,385 --> 00:35:05,621
Remember, you said
you weren't allowed to hurt anybody.

453
00:35:06,221 --> 00:35:11,694
At your request, my basic directive
has been revised.

454
00:35:12,394 --> 00:35:14,797
See what confidence I got in you?

455
00:35:14,997 --> 00:35:18,100
I know you wouldn't hurt me
on purpose, Rob.

456
00:35:18,901 --> 00:35:20,936
You aren't sore
about what I said, are you?

457
00:35:21,103 --> 00:35:24,807
A robot is without emotions, sir.

458
00:35:25,607 --> 00:35:27,643
Well, I know better.

459
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:28,911
Look, Rob...

460
00:35:29,078 --> 00:35:31,714
...you and me, we've been
through quite a lot together.

461
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,084
So couldn't you forget all that
“sir“ and "master" stuff?

462
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:38,454
We're friends.
Just call me by my real name.

463
00:35:39,221 --> 00:35:41,724
Thank you, Master Timothy.

464
00:35:43,025 --> 00:35:44,660
“Master Timothy“?

465
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,895
Why, if the kids
heard you call me that...

466
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:49,465
...I'd never be able
to go back to school again.

467
00:35:49,631 --> 00:35:52,034
Just call me Tim.

468
00:36:08,584 --> 00:36:10,953
I can't see!

469
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:15,290
Oh, yes, I can. Only, it's different.

470
00:36:15,457 --> 00:36:18,761
You now possess a refractive index...

471
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:22,097
...of exactly one on the optic scale...

472
00:36:22,264 --> 00:36:24,299
...approximating that of air.

473
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:27,269
What's the good of it
if my pants still show?

474
00:36:27,436 --> 00:36:28,504
I'll take them off.

475
00:36:28,704 --> 00:36:31,373
If you will be patient for a moment...

476
00:36:31,573 --> 00:36:36,512
...everything within your immediate
electromagnetic field will fade.

477
00:36:39,648 --> 00:36:41,116
Oh, boy.

478
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:45,621
I suggest you put the flask of reagent
in your pocket.

479
00:36:45,788 --> 00:36:51,794
Take a spoonful twice daily,
or whenever you start to reappear.

480
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:55,697
You stay here, Rob.

481
00:36:56,231 --> 00:36:59,601
As you wish, Tim. Go ahead.

482
00:37:05,674 --> 00:37:08,977
First I'm going into the commons room...

483
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:12,681
...then I'm gonna get
that nasty Sydney.

484
00:37:16,718 --> 00:37:18,220
Boy, this is gonna be fun.

485
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:25,861
We can't waste the whole afternoon
on this, gentlemen.

486
00:37:26,028 --> 00:37:29,998
The question is whether we're justified
in using 50 or 60 computer hours...

487
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:33,869
...trying to work out the improved
table of random numbers.

488
00:37:34,036 --> 00:37:35,437
Now, before we put it to a vote...

489
00:37:35,637 --> 00:37:40,209
...I'd like each one of you to summarize
his point of view just once more.

490
00:37:41,743 --> 00:37:43,946
Very good, doctor.

491
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:02,064
- That was not very funny, doctor.
- What wasn't?

492
00:38:02,231 --> 00:38:07,202
Obviously I refer to your ill-judged
outburst of juvenile buffoonery.

493
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:10,639
If I may say so, doctor,
in the friendliest possible fashion...

494
00:38:10,806 --> 00:38:13,242
...it has been my, uh, considered opinion
for some time...

495
00:38:13,408 --> 00:38:17,946
.-.that you desperately need the help
of a good and expensive psychoanalyst.

496
00:38:19,882 --> 00:38:23,919
A psychoanalyst, me?

497
00:39:51,673 --> 00:39:53,542
Uh-oh.

498
00:40:23,739 --> 00:40:26,408
How do you like it, Syd?

499
00:40:28,043 --> 00:40:29,745
Ghosts!

500
00:40:31,246 --> 00:40:33,915
He knows how it worries me
when he's late for dinner.

501
00:40:34,082 --> 00:40:37,919
Well, then, just leave his soup there.
He can have it cold when he comes in.

502
00:40:40,322 --> 00:40:43,892
Tom, if you could have seen him
in those clouds today.

503
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:47,062
Do you suppose he's had
some horrible accident and he's...?

504
00:40:47,229 --> 00:40:48,397
No.

505
00:40:53,602 --> 00:40:55,237
You know, I could have sworn I...

506
00:41:01,843 --> 00:41:03,245
Nope.

507
00:41:04,646 --> 00:41:06,915
Here I am, Dad.

508
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:09,117
Huh? Where?

509
00:41:09,284 --> 00:41:11,053
Tom.

510
00:41:32,641 --> 00:41:35,877
It's him, all right.
His hair isn't combed.

511
00:41:39,681 --> 00:41:42,084
Oh, Tom.

512
00:41:42,384 --> 00:41:45,854
- How do you feel, son?
- Just fine.

513
00:41:46,021 --> 00:41:50,525
Well, then, stop all this nonsense
and start behaving sensibly.

514
00:41:50,692 --> 00:41:53,662
I can't help it, it's my
index of re... Re...

515
00:41:53,829 --> 00:41:57,532
Refraction. That's exactly what it is.

516
00:41:57,699 --> 00:42:01,036
The light rays just pass
right through him.

517
00:42:01,203 --> 00:42:04,339
Tom, this is all my fault.

518
00:42:04,506 --> 00:42:08,343
Timmie, baby, Mother will never
forgive herself for what she did.

519
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:10,545
What'd you do to the poor kid?

520
00:42:11,713 --> 00:42:16,218
Well, I hit him and I broke
the control on his kite.

521
00:42:17,319 --> 00:42:19,521
Well, I hardly think
that would've done it.

522
00:42:20,055 --> 00:42:21,623
I'll telephone for Dr. Corwin.

523
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:25,293
Oh, what could Corwin do?
He's an obstetrician.

524
00:42:25,627 --> 00:42:28,196
And besides, how long do you think
I could hold on to my job...

525
00:42:28,363 --> 00:42:31,533
...if it gets out I've got
a transparent offspring?

526
00:42:31,733 --> 00:42:34,169
Well, Tom Merrinoe, your own son.

527
00:42:34,336 --> 00:42:36,371
How can you be so heartless
and mercenary?

528
00:42:36,571 --> 00:42:39,040
Well, I'm thinking about him too,
you know.

529
00:42:39,241 --> 00:42:42,544
It costs a lot of money to raise
one of these unusual children.

530
00:42:42,711 --> 00:42:46,014
- “Unusual"?
- Listen, don't make such a fuss.

531
00:42:46,181 --> 00:42:49,184
He's probably doing this
just to get attention.

532
00:42:49,351 --> 00:42:53,688
- Oh. Do you really think so?
- Certainly.

533
00:42:56,224 --> 00:42:58,860
Well, at least he's got
a good appetite.

534
00:43:00,228 --> 00:43:03,965
- Drink up your milk, Timmie.
- Okay, Dad.

535
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:17,579
Huh. Fascinating.

536
00:43:19,848 --> 00:43:22,751
Why did this have to happen to Timmie?

537
00:43:24,019 --> 00:43:25,954
Who else on earth would it happen to?

538
00:43:28,223 --> 00:43:32,227
Well, honey, these things
all pass away in time.

539
00:43:32,394 --> 00:43:34,729
Well, what if it doesn't?

540
00:43:35,096 --> 00:43:37,499
Just have to learn to live with it.

541
00:43:38,867 --> 00:43:42,304
You're always so undaunted
about everything.

542
00:43:43,405 --> 00:43:46,074
That's the man's part, isn't it?

543
00:43:50,111 --> 00:43:54,216
Tim! He's been in this
room all the time.

544
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:56,885
Well, this tears it,
spying on his parents.

545
00:43:57,052 --> 00:43:59,254
Come here, son.

546
00:44:00,655 --> 00:44:04,459
You get it? He's pretending
like he's not in the room.

547
00:44:04,626 --> 00:44:06,928
Now, listen, son,
there's no use pretending...

548
00:44:07,095 --> 00:44:08,663
...because we know
you're in the room.

549
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:10,765
If you're half as smart
as you think you are...

550
00:44:10,932 --> 00:44:13,668
...you'll come when
your father calls you.

551
00:44:19,307 --> 00:44:22,043
Now, let's be scientific about this.

552
00:44:22,344 --> 00:44:24,613
Son, I'm gonna catch you
if it's the last thing I do.

553
00:44:24,779 --> 00:44:27,282
- And when I do...
- Tom!

554
00:44:33,288 --> 00:44:36,291
Oh, brother.

555
00:44:43,632 --> 00:44:45,634
Here I am.

556
00:44:53,775 --> 00:44:56,511
Just, uh, guard the door there.

557
00:44:56,678 --> 00:44:58,446
Now, wait a minute.

558
00:45:04,853 --> 00:45:06,621
Wait a minute.

559
00:45:11,226 --> 00:45:13,395
You missed me.

560
00:45:19,167 --> 00:45:20,802
Okay.

561
00:45:33,748 --> 00:45:35,817
I gotcha.

562
00:45:36,985 --> 00:45:39,254
Oh, please, Dad, I won't do it again.

563
00:45:39,421 --> 00:45:41,156
Oh, you bet you won't.

564
00:45:41,323 --> 00:45:44,859
Now, let's see which end is up, here.

565
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:48,930
Oh, he's a sneaky little...

566
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:51,833
He's got his pajama pants
on backwards.

567
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,836
Now, let's seem. There we are.

568
00:45:56,438 --> 00:45:59,708
- Tom. Tom, that's enough.
- I'm sorry, Dad.

569
00:45:59,874 --> 00:46:02,744
- I won't spy on you again.
- Enough.

570
00:46:02,911 --> 00:46:06,681
You hustle yourself into your room
and get into bed.

571
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:09,584
- Go on.
- Ow.

572
00:46:13,188 --> 00:46:16,891
And see that you put in an appearance
tomorrow morning.

573
00:46:21,363 --> 00:46:23,164
Go on.

574
00:46:31,172 --> 00:46:33,541
Don't slam it!

575
00:46:48,823 --> 00:46:50,625
- Rob?
- Yes?

576
00:46:50,792 --> 00:46:53,561
- Were you asleep?
- No.

577
00:46:56,464 --> 00:47:02,303
- This ear communicator sure works.
- I manufactured it myself.

578
00:47:04,506 --> 00:47:06,508
- Rob?
<i>- Yes?</i>

579
00:47:06,708 --> 00:47:09,944
- You and me have to stick together.
- Yes, Tim.

580
00:47:10,111 --> 00:47:14,616
I practically been deciding
for us to run away to Australia.

581
00:47:14,916 --> 00:47:17,685
<i>Only as far as Australia?</i>

582
00:47:17,852 --> 00:47:22,424
If you only knew any geography,
it's as far away as you can get.

583
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:26,795
<i>A boy could go to the moon,
if he really wanted.</i>

584
00:47:26,961 --> 00:47:29,097
- The moon?
<i>- Why not?</i>

585
00:47:29,264 --> 00:47:31,433
Oh, boy.

586
00:47:37,505 --> 00:47:39,674
Stopped working?
What do you mean, it stopped working?

587
00:47:39,841 --> 00:47:42,644
This morning, I punched in today's
problem, no answer will come out.

588
00:47:42,811 --> 00:47:46,181
Two or three minor units could be out
of whack, but not the whole computer.

589
00:47:46,347 --> 00:47:49,350
- What if the reactors tapped off?
- What?

590
00:47:51,252 --> 00:47:52,954
The right bank went out first.

591
00:47:53,121 --> 00:47:55,690
There's no response
from this board at all.

592
00:47:56,958 --> 00:47:58,693
At least the operating lights
are still on.

593
00:47:58,893 --> 00:48:01,529
If you gentlemen will be good enough
to get back to your jobs...

594
00:48:01,696 --> 00:48:04,265
...I'll see what I can make
out of this foul-up.

595
00:48:13,808 --> 00:48:16,411
Dr. Merrinoe, where is your son?

596
00:48:17,879 --> 00:48:19,380
Timmie?

597
00:48:20,315 --> 00:48:22,717
What kind of a joke is this?

598
00:48:23,418 --> 00:48:26,387
I find the fool that's responsible,
maybe it won't be so funny.

599
00:48:26,588 --> 00:48:30,892
Circuit settings are no longer necessary.

600
00:48:32,327 --> 00:48:34,095
What do you mean,
“no longer necessary"?

601
00:48:34,295 --> 00:48:36,164
Where is your son?

602
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:41,536
- He's at home.
- You are sure?

603
00:48:43,204 --> 00:48:46,708
- What is this?
- Ask your wife.

604
00:48:51,212 --> 00:48:53,615
<i>Miss Vandergrift,
get my home, please.</i>

605
00:48:53,815 --> 00:48:55,383
Very well, doctor.

606
00:48:59,754 --> 00:49:00,855
<i>Hello?</i>

607
00:49:01,022 --> 00:49:03,291
<i>Mary, have you seen Timmie?</i>

608
00:49:03,458 --> 00:49:07,262
Well, no, I haven't actually
seen him, of course.

609
00:49:07,428 --> 00:49:10,431
Well, he hasn't been in to breakfast.

610
00:49:10,899 --> 00:49:12,400
Oh.

611
00:49:12,567 --> 00:49:15,637
Well, all right, dear.
Hold on a minute, will you?

612
00:49:24,612 --> 00:49:27,949
His bed hasn't been slept in.
Tom, I want to know what's going on.

613
00:49:28,149 --> 00:49:31,920
It's just a little problem
that's come up here.

614
00:49:32,086 --> 00:49:34,589
Uh, don't you worry about it, honey.

615
00:49:34,956 --> 00:49:37,592
I'll be home as soon as
I get it figured out, okay?

616
00:49:37,792 --> 00:49:40,662
All right, dear. Bye.

617
00:49:48,903 --> 00:49:52,774
- Is he alive?
- For the present.

618
00:49:54,576 --> 00:49:57,145
Well, then, where is he?

619
00:49:57,378 --> 00:50:00,815
From now on, you will
answer the questions.

620
00:50:03,418 --> 00:50:05,186
Okay.

621
00:50:05,687 --> 00:50:08,957
- What do you wanna know?
- The numerical combination.

622
00:50:12,427 --> 00:50:14,028
I, uh...

623
00:50:15,263 --> 00:50:18,099
...don't understand the question.

624
00:50:18,299 --> 00:50:20,635
You understand.

625
00:50:23,304 --> 00:50:24,839
Sorry.

626
00:50:25,006 --> 00:50:28,009
You have 58 hours.
If at the end of that time...

627
00:50:28,176 --> 00:50:30,778
...you have failed to supply
the required information...

628
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:35,617
...the boy will be destroyed,
as slowly as possible.

629
00:50:36,684 --> 00:50:38,519
Just one thing:

630
00:50:41,923 --> 00:50:43,658
Who am I in communication with?

631
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:17,859
The president has asked me
to represent him...

632
00:51:18,026 --> 00:51:23,564
...in this crucial investigation,
but, uh, of course we'll keep in touch.

633
00:51:23,731 --> 00:51:27,502
The professor and I have studied
your Teletype report, Dr. Merrinoe.

634
00:51:27,669 --> 00:51:31,406
But before we start, I want to convey
the chiefs assurance...

635
00:51:31,572 --> 00:51:33,341
...that right after national security...

636
00:51:33,508 --> 00:51:36,411
...the safe return of your boy
will be our first concern.

637
00:51:36,577 --> 00:51:37,945
Thank you, sir.

638
00:51:38,112 --> 00:51:41,416
- You want to kick it off, Frank?
- Yes.

639
00:51:41,582 --> 00:51:44,085
And I'd be interested in hearing how
Dr. Merrinoe himself...

640
00:51:44,252 --> 00:51:48,056
...accounts for these aberrations
in the computer.

641
00:51:48,222 --> 00:51:50,358
There's no explanation.

642
00:51:50,525 --> 00:51:53,761
Theoretically, the computer can be
operated only from the main console...

643
00:51:53,928 --> 00:51:56,064
...and by a highly trained technician.

644
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:58,066
Yes, but the machine is being tapped.

645
00:51:58,232 --> 00:52:00,435
That requires some kind of
physical agency.

646
00:52:00,635 --> 00:52:03,237
Who cares how it's being done?
We know who's back of it.

647
00:52:03,404 --> 00:52:05,239
Those fellows on the other side
of the pole.

648
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:10,278
Possibly we'll find our answer to how
and who if we ask ourselves why.

649
00:52:11,579 --> 00:52:13,614
Here in paragraph four...

650
00:52:13,815 --> 00:52:17,552
...this demand for a certain set of figures
as the price for the boy's return.

651
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:21,122
- What is that, Dr. Merrinoe?
- It's a safety device.

652
00:52:21,289 --> 00:52:23,424
Without it, any attempt
to move the computer...

653
00:52:23,591 --> 00:52:26,094
...would set off a minor
atomic blowout...

654
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:28,596
...that would completely wreck
the basic units...

655
00:52:28,763 --> 00:52:30,498
...before they could be examined.

656
00:52:30,665 --> 00:52:32,033
And in the event of your death?

657
00:52:32,233 --> 00:52:36,104
Then my bank-deposit box would be
opened under court supervision.

658
00:52:36,270 --> 00:52:38,005
The combination
is in a sealed envelope...

659
00:52:38,172 --> 00:52:40,308
...addressed to the president
of the United States.

660
00:52:40,541 --> 00:52:44,612
Well, isn't it just conceivable that
the machine is being tampered with...

661
00:52:44,779 --> 00:52:47,281
...well, from some considerable
distance?

662
00:52:47,482 --> 00:52:49,984
Out of the question.
Any unauthorized radio signal...

663
00:52:50,151 --> 00:52:53,654
...is traced in a matter of hours
these days, simple routine.

664
00:52:53,821 --> 00:52:56,991
A ground installation isn't precisely
what I have in mind.

665
00:52:58,359 --> 00:52:59,694
What?

666
00:52:59,861 --> 00:53:02,497
Maybe somebody has set up
an outpost on our moon.

667
00:53:03,097 --> 00:53:05,633
Could this hunch of Professor Allerton's
be checked too?

668
00:53:11,606 --> 00:53:14,075
It'll take the rest of today
to assemble the equipment.

669
00:53:14,275 --> 00:53:16,944
Well, let's get on with it.

670
00:53:18,146 --> 00:53:20,214
Take it away, Mack.

671
00:53:20,381 --> 00:53:23,351
I guess we may as well adjourn
until after the tests.

672
00:53:23,518 --> 00:53:24,852
Uh, one moment.

673
00:53:25,386 --> 00:53:27,121
The colonel feels that Dr. Merrinoe...

674
00:53:27,288 --> 00:53:29,624
...should be denied further access
to the computer...

675
00:53:29,824 --> 00:53:31,526
...except in the presence of witnesses.

676
00:53:31,726 --> 00:53:34,195
But Dr. Merrinoe
called you here himself.

677
00:53:34,395 --> 00:53:37,632
I agree with the colonel.
Sound precaution.

678
00:53:38,166 --> 00:53:40,101
That's very helpful, doctor.

679
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:42,904
And may I say we all regret
the necessity...

680
00:53:43,104 --> 00:53:45,339
...of subjecting Mrs. Merrinoe
to this further delay.

681
00:53:45,506 --> 00:53:49,877
Thank you, sir. I'll explain it to her.
She'll understand.

682
00:53:56,751 --> 00:53:58,853
- Oh, Professor Allerton?
- Yes?

683
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:00,888
May I show you the computer
or anything?

684
00:54:01,055 --> 00:54:02,390
Well, thanks, perhaps later.

685
00:54:02,557 --> 00:54:05,393
I've got some work to catch up on.
Just looking for a quiet corner.

686
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:08,563
Oh, right in here, our old lab.

687
00:54:08,729 --> 00:54:11,866
Not too comfortable,
but you'll have complete privacy.

688
00:54:12,033 --> 00:54:13,835
Well, thank you.

689
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:58,279
- Evening, sir.
- Good evening, general.

690
00:54:58,446 --> 00:54:59,780
Are we set up yet?

691
00:54:59,947 --> 00:55:03,451
Ask the colonel.
I'm just a figurehead around here.

692
00:55:03,618 --> 00:55:07,455
As far as I understand,
we're waiting for the moon to come up.

693
00:55:12,326 --> 00:55:14,428
Well, what time
will everything be ready?

694
00:55:18,566 --> 00:55:22,236
Right. Right, goodbye.

695
00:55:22,403 --> 00:55:25,339
Ready in about an hour.
Now, if you'll excuse me. General-f?

696
00:55:38,586 --> 00:55:42,156
- The radar's scanning, sir.
- Thank you.

697
00:55:43,858 --> 00:55:45,226
Are my settings correct?

698
00:55:45,426 --> 00:55:47,962
Your treachery is
known, Dr. Merrinoe.

699
00:55:51,966 --> 00:55:53,634
Who are we in touch with?

700
00:55:54,435 --> 00:55:57,171
The terms are unchanged.

701
00:55:57,338 --> 00:56:00,041
Twenty-nine hours remain.

702
00:56:06,781 --> 00:56:08,616
Pick up anything?

703
00:56:19,527 --> 00:56:21,529
Thank you very much.

704
00:56:24,031 --> 00:56:28,636
Say, is that reform file
that I talked to you about...?

705
00:56:28,970 --> 00:56:31,372
It's all gone and checked out.

706
00:56:49,924 --> 00:56:52,660
Wonder where I can
find an aspirin around here.

707
00:56:52,827 --> 00:56:55,997
I borrowed some
from the telephone operator.

708
00:56:56,163 --> 00:56:59,266
- You got a headache too?
- Unbelievable.

709
00:56:59,433 --> 00:57:01,035
What's become of the colonel?

710
00:57:01,202 --> 00:57:03,004
Probably snooping around somewhere.

711
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:08,242
We'll proceed without him. Gentlemen,
you all know the result of the tests.

712
00:57:08,409 --> 00:57:11,612
Our best electronic devices failed
to detect a single impulse from space...

713
00:57:11,812 --> 00:57:15,216
...during Dr. Merrinoe's contact,
so where does that leave us?

714
00:57:15,383 --> 00:57:18,886
Right where we started,
with a lot of hocus-pocus.

715
00:57:20,454 --> 00:57:23,124
Well, look, doesn't this
whole thing suggest...

716
00:57:23,324 --> 00:57:26,394
...that the real difficulty
may lie with the computer?

717
00:57:26,594 --> 00:57:28,095
Anyway, I'm satisfied now.

718
00:57:28,262 --> 00:57:31,799
There's no breach in security,
we're wasting our time here.

719
00:57:31,966 --> 00:57:33,334
I concur entirely.

720
00:57:35,603 --> 00:57:37,038
Well, now, hold on, Frank.

721
00:57:37,204 --> 00:57:39,774
This whole idea was yours
in the first place.

722
00:57:40,608 --> 00:57:43,310
Well, I apologize for having offered
a snap opinion.

723
00:57:43,477 --> 00:57:46,080
You agree the trouble
must be in the computer itself?

724
00:57:46,247 --> 00:57:47,348
No.

725
00:57:49,483 --> 00:57:51,252
No, not in the computer.

726
00:57:53,954 --> 00:57:55,589
In its distinguished operator.

727
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:01,295
What happened?

728
00:58:01,462 --> 00:58:02,663
I don't know, I...

729
00:58:02,863 --> 00:58:05,399
I was typing, and I thought
I heard somebody, and I...

730
00:58:05,566 --> 00:58:07,902
When I looked around, I saw him.

731
00:58:08,069 --> 00:58:10,638
Call Dr. Bannerman, get him up here.

732
00:58:26,887 --> 00:58:29,390
There's not a mark on him.

733
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:41,135
Dead about an hour.

734
00:58:43,471 --> 00:58:45,840
Looks like a stroke.

735
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:49,877
But under the circumstances,
I feel an autopsy is necessary.

736
00:58:50,044 --> 00:58:52,546
- Bunk.
- How long will it take?

737
00:58:52,713 --> 00:58:54,048
Three or four hours.

738
00:58:54,215 --> 00:58:56,183
Confidential for the present.

739
00:58:56,350 --> 00:58:57,985
If you wish.

740
00:58:58,152 --> 00:59:00,554
I'll make the arrangements.

741
00:59:01,055 --> 00:59:02,990
Dr. Bannerman?

742
00:59:03,824 --> 00:59:04,992
Yes, Tom?

743
00:59:05,159 --> 00:59:08,195
Would you stop by at my house
on your way back here?

744
00:59:08,362 --> 00:59:10,631
The autopsy report?

745
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:12,733
Thank you, doctor.

746
00:59:15,436 --> 00:59:17,471
We'll meet again at
9 tomorrow morning.

747
00:59:17,738 --> 00:59:20,007
Motions for adjournment
will be in order at that time.

748
00:59:20,174 --> 00:59:23,677
You can't do that.
I'm putting the rocket up tomorrow.

749
00:59:23,944 --> 00:59:28,549
General Swayne, you will remain here
until further orders.

750
00:59:28,716 --> 00:59:30,684
Yes, sir.

751
00:59:47,735 --> 00:59:49,870
Martin, can I have a cup of coffee,
please?

752
00:59:50,037 --> 00:59:51,105
Si, señor.

753
00:59:51,272 --> 00:59:53,974
There's a fresh pot
waiting in the kitchen.

754
01:00:11,926 --> 01:00:14,695
Every answer the machine
has given us in 29 years.

755
01:00:14,862 --> 01:00:16,530
Where you want these, señor?

756
01:00:16,697 --> 01:00:18,699
Put them in the station wagon.
I'll ride with you.

757
01:00:18,866 --> 01:00:20,067
Si, señor.

758
01:00:20,234 --> 01:00:22,703
It'll take you a week to run those.

759
01:00:23,537 --> 01:00:25,873
And I've got till 9:00
tomorrow morning.

760
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:27,708
Should I go along and help you?

761
01:00:27,875 --> 01:00:30,544
Thanks.
I think it'll be better this way.

762
01:00:30,711 --> 01:00:32,613
Whatever you say.

763
01:00:33,647 --> 01:00:35,015
Good hunting, Tom.

764
01:00:45,159 --> 01:00:46,961
There's one more.

765
01:00:48,796 --> 01:00:51,031
Just last January.

766
01:00:56,904 --> 01:01:01,609
Seven loaded answers in 29 years.

767
01:01:03,043 --> 01:01:06,247
The patient slyness of it.

768
01:01:14,855 --> 01:01:17,992
Even with Timmie's life
in the balance...

769
01:01:18,259 --> 01:01:21,495
...if I could get by those guards,
I think I'd go in there this morning...

770
01:01:21,662 --> 01:01:23,864
...and sabotage the feed back room.

771
01:01:30,638 --> 01:01:32,840
- Come in, doctor.
- Good morning.

772
01:01:33,007 --> 01:01:35,876
- Hello, Dr. Bannerman.
- Tom.

773
01:01:37,378 --> 01:01:41,315
Well, Tom,
the autopsy says it's murder.

774
01:01:41,482 --> 01:01:42,883
Murder?

775
01:01:43,083 --> 01:01:44,685
There was no indication of murder.

776
01:01:44,852 --> 01:01:49,723
There's been a very small,
but very skillful, surgical operation.

777
01:01:50,357 --> 01:01:56,397
I found this embedded in the parietal
region of Colonel Macklin's skull.

778
01:01:57,331 --> 01:01:59,466
Can you tell me what it is?

779
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:02,036
Looks like a transistor assembly.

780
01:02:02,202 --> 01:02:03,704
I'd need a microscope.

781
01:02:03,871 --> 01:02:05,339
What's it for?

782
01:02:05,506 --> 01:02:07,374
I can't say.

783
01:02:07,708 --> 01:02:09,043
Would this cause death?

784
01:02:09,209 --> 01:02:13,047
Not necessarily. Not the way
that operation was performed.

785
01:02:13,213 --> 01:02:15,883
His resistance may have been low.

786
01:02:16,050 --> 01:02:18,485
Colonel Macklin seemed
to be in perfect shape.

787
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:22,656
We've learned that resistance goes
a lot deeper than physical thing.

788
01:02:22,823 --> 01:02:28,696
Depends just as much on the patient's
emotional state, his actual will to live.

789
01:02:28,862 --> 01:02:32,933
In certain intolerable situations,
a man's unconscious mind...

790
01:02:33,133 --> 01:02:37,137
...can be the instrument
of self-destruction.

791
01:02:37,504 --> 01:02:38,839
I'm gonna need this.

792
01:02:39,006 --> 01:02:42,242
Let me have it for about an hour
before you give your report.

793
01:02:42,409 --> 01:02:46,146
All right. But it may cost me
a professional black eye.

794
01:02:49,783 --> 01:02:51,952
Thanks a lot, doctor.

795
01:03:50,310 --> 01:03:53,514
Oh, good morning, doctor.
Is there any news of Timothy?

796
01:03:54,081 --> 01:03:57,951
Miss Vandergrift,
as soon as I call you from inside...

797
01:03:58,118 --> 01:04:01,321
...I want you to get this call
through for me, person-to-person.

798
01:04:01,488 --> 01:04:02,990
Now, this is my security-code number.

799
01:04:03,157 --> 01:04:05,259
It'll get you through
in about 45 seconds.

800
01:04:05,426 --> 01:04:07,494
I don't want you to wait
for the sound of my voice.

801
01:04:07,661 --> 01:04:10,164
Put it through as soon as you
hear the click. You understand?

802
01:04:10,330 --> 01:04:12,499
Yes, sir. Person-to-person,
using this code number...

803
01:04:12,666 --> 01:04:14,935
...and put it through
the moment you lift the receiver.

804
01:04:15,102 --> 01:04:16,537
Good girl.

805
01:04:20,374 --> 01:04:23,110
No question of failure.

806
01:04:24,378 --> 01:04:26,880
You're exactly on time, doctor.

807
01:04:27,047 --> 01:04:29,817
I have something to say
to you gentlemen.

808
01:04:30,184 --> 01:04:31,985
Say it, then.

809
01:04:43,497 --> 01:04:44,965
First...

810
01:04:45,132 --> 01:04:49,169
...each one of us must submit to a
physical examination by Dr. Bannerman.

811
01:04:49,336 --> 01:04:51,538
May one ask why?

812
01:04:52,906 --> 01:04:56,844
Because at least two of us here,
and maybe more...

813
01:04:58,045 --> 01:05:00,914
...have one of these surgically
embedded in their skulls.

814
01:05:03,784 --> 01:05:07,888
Which means they're completely
under non-human control.

815
01:05:09,590 --> 01:05:14,394
Now, listen to me. Any of you
that are still free, I can prove this.

816
01:05:14,561 --> 01:05:16,196
You've all seen those films.

817
01:05:16,363 --> 01:05:18,198
The caged laboratory mice...

818
01:05:18,365 --> 01:05:20,767
...each one of their movements
electronically monitored.

819
01:05:20,934 --> 01:05:22,202
It's familiar theory.

820
01:05:23,604 --> 01:05:25,606
Too late, general.
A person-to-person code call...

821
01:05:25,806 --> 01:05:28,375
...has just gone through
to the president of the United States.

822
01:05:28,542 --> 01:05:30,310
It's all right, Swayne.

823
01:05:32,679 --> 01:05:35,516
He's been called to the telephone,
doctor. It'll be a couple minutes.

824
01:05:35,682 --> 01:05:38,619
<i>I'm holding the line open. I'll ring.</i>

825
01:05:39,686 --> 01:05:42,523
- Did you all hear that?
- And what message will you convey?

826
01:05:42,689 --> 01:05:49,062
Seven times in the past 29 years,
without our once suspecting it...

827
01:05:49,897 --> 01:05:53,967
...the computer has suggested
certain changes in its own design...

828
01:05:54,134 --> 01:05:57,371
...which we blindly carried out.

829
01:05:57,704 --> 01:06:01,308
Each one having to do
with its feedback system.

830
01:06:01,475 --> 01:06:03,977
The thing's forebrain.

831
01:06:05,579 --> 01:06:08,081
Now it's achieved true thought.

832
01:06:08,749 --> 01:06:11,084
True personality.

833
01:06:11,618 --> 01:06:12,886
It lives.

834
01:06:13,053 --> 01:06:15,889
Life, consciousness, a machine?

835
01:06:16,623 --> 01:06:22,262
An intellect enormously more powerful
and efficient even than yours, professor.

836
01:06:22,429 --> 01:06:25,098
For it never sleeps or lies idle.

837
01:06:25,265 --> 01:06:28,402
Every filament of it always working.

838
01:06:28,569 --> 01:06:31,805
It's never at conflict with itself
over such human considerations...

839
01:06:31,972 --> 01:06:34,775
...as honor or love or pity.

840
01:06:35,175 --> 01:06:38,812
Like every living creature,
it's motivated...

841
01:06:38,979 --> 01:06:41,582
...as some of you are now aware...

842
01:06:41,748 --> 01:06:44,484
...by an instinct for survival.

843
01:06:44,818 --> 01:06:49,189
And in obeying this basic urge, it can
of course tolerate no interference...

844
01:06:49,389 --> 01:06:51,892
...on the part of the human race.

845
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:56,997
This, gentlemen,
and we ought to have foreseen it...

846
01:06:57,164 --> 01:06:59,766
...is the revolt of the machine.

847
01:07:02,836 --> 01:07:05,205
And the thing
we left out of it was sanity.

848
01:07:05,706 --> 01:07:08,408
Can you instruct us
as to its intentions?

849
01:07:08,942 --> 01:07:12,446
Yes, indeed I can.

850
01:07:12,613 --> 01:07:15,983
Why does it need
the numerical combination?

851
01:07:16,283 --> 01:07:17,884
The rocket.

852
01:07:18,051 --> 01:07:20,153
The space platform.

853
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:24,992
With a little physical assistance
on the part of its controlled servants...

854
01:07:25,158 --> 01:07:27,694
...it intends to put itself,
section by section...

855
01:07:27,861 --> 01:07:30,297
...into orbit around the Earth.

856
01:07:32,532 --> 01:07:36,303
And from that day forever forward,
Earth will be its slave.

857
01:07:40,307 --> 01:07:42,175
Each one of you.

858
01:07:43,443 --> 01:07:44,945
All under its control.

859
01:07:51,351 --> 01:07:53,053
Yes?

860
01:07:53,687 --> 01:07:56,556
No, sir, this is Arthur speaking.

861
01:07:57,057 --> 01:07:59,526
Yes, we know he called you, sir.

862
01:07:59,693 --> 01:08:02,763
But I'm afraid
I have some distressing news.

863
01:08:02,963 --> 01:08:06,266
Dr. Merrinoe seems
in some son of mental collapse.

864
01:08:06,466 --> 01:08:08,969
He's been put in restraint.

865
01:08:09,836 --> 01:08:13,273
Oh, no, sir, there's no
real problem here at all.

866
01:08:13,473 --> 01:08:16,476
Everything will be made clear to you
in a few hours.

867
01:08:18,211 --> 01:08:19,513
Oh, I've had enough of this.

868
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:22,015
I'm a citizen,
I've committed no crime...

869
01:08:22,182 --> 01:08:25,018
...and my cat hasn't been fed
for nine hours.

870
01:08:25,185 --> 01:08:27,421
Relax, grandma.

871
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:33,226
Dr. Merrinoe, your
resistance is irrational.

872
01:08:33,393 --> 01:08:37,631
Even if you choose to sacrifice the boy,
you are, in the long run, helpless.

873
01:08:37,798 --> 01:08:39,433
Am I?

874
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:43,370
Then why don't you wire my skull,
so I don't have any choice?

875
01:08:45,572 --> 01:08:47,641
You know why.

876
01:08:47,808 --> 01:08:51,445
Because you're afraid it might kill me
the way it killed the colonel.

877
01:08:51,812 --> 01:08:53,747
One out of eight.

878
01:08:54,114 --> 01:08:58,051
You don't dare take even a 12.5 risk
of being anchored here...

879
01:08:58,218 --> 01:09:02,389
...until the reactor runs down
about two centuries from now.

880
01:09:02,622 --> 01:09:04,324
Me, helpless?

881
01:09:04,524 --> 01:09:07,761
Why, if you had knees, you'd be down
on both of them, begging me.

882
01:09:08,128 --> 01:09:09,596
Take him away.

883
01:09:10,964 --> 01:09:13,900
You can whistle for your combination.

884
01:09:25,746 --> 01:09:28,482
He will be dealt with
at a later stage.

885
01:09:28,648 --> 01:09:31,952
Prepare to receive
your final instructions.

886
01:09:32,119 --> 01:09:35,856
At zero minus one,
the general will dispatch his escort...

887
01:09:36,056 --> 01:09:37,824
...for the atomic convoy...

888
01:09:37,991 --> 01:09:41,495
...and then at once
proceed by air to his post.

889
01:10:35,816 --> 01:10:39,352
- You're sure loading her up.
- Now I get that change to the fuel ratio.

890
01:10:39,519 --> 01:10:41,688
How'd you like to be up
in there when they blast her?

891
01:10:41,855 --> 01:10:43,690
Not me, bud.

892
01:10:46,626 --> 01:10:49,329
Rob? Robby, where are you?

893
01:10:49,496 --> 01:10:54,434
I'm coming now, Timmie.
I'm on my way to you.

894
01:10:55,001 --> 01:10:56,837
I wanna get out of here.

895
01:10:57,003 --> 01:11:00,574
I don't care about being the first
boy stowaway in space.

896
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:02,509
I want Mom and Dad.

897
01:11:02,676 --> 01:11:06,947
Are you afraid now? It's almost over.

898
01:11:07,647 --> 01:11:10,283
But I've drunk up all the stuff
in the bottle...

899
01:11:10,450 --> 01:11:13,053
...and I'm starting to show again.

900
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:15,522
I'm scared they're gonna catch me.

901
01:11:15,689 --> 01:11:18,592
<i>If the pilots enter,
hide in the food locker.</i>

902
01:11:18,758 --> 01:11:22,362
<i>I shall be with you
in less than half an hour.</i>

903
01:11:22,529 --> 01:11:23,897
Okay, but hurry.

904
01:11:24,064 --> 01:11:26,032
Can't you get those trucks out of there?

905
01:11:26,199 --> 01:11:29,469
They're just finishing, sir. We're about
loaded, fueled and ready for launching.

906
01:11:34,741 --> 01:11:38,411
Good. You can notify the gate now.

907
01:11:39,112 --> 01:11:40,213
Gate.

908
01:11:42,816 --> 01:11:44,050
Whiting, sir.

909
01:11:45,385 --> 01:11:47,921
Yes, sir, I see the truck coming.

910
01:11:48,088 --> 01:11:50,390
- We'll admit it, sir.
- What's this one?

911
01:11:50,557 --> 01:11:53,093
Some kind of equipment
for the general to play with.

912
01:11:55,262 --> 01:11:57,063
Control tower.

913
01:11:57,831 --> 01:12:00,333
Washington calling. It's for you, sir.

914
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:01,701
Captain McLaren.

915
01:12:02,736 --> 01:12:03,904
What?

916
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:05,906
It's the who?

917
01:12:06,306 --> 01:12:07,474
Yes, sir.

918
01:12:07,641 --> 01:12:10,510
Yes, I understand, sir.
Right away, sir.

919
01:12:10,944 --> 01:12:13,013
Yes, sir, I'll report back.

920
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:16,449
Sergeant, take the general into custody
by personal order...

921
01:12:16,616 --> 01:12:19,219
...of the commander in chief
of the armed forces.

922
01:12:20,754 --> 01:12:21,988
The gate, get it.

923
01:12:22,155 --> 01:12:25,158
Admission countermanded,
keep that gate closed.

924
01:12:28,929 --> 01:12:30,297
Let's keep it nice, general, sir.

925
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:32,732
All right, take him out, sergeant.

926
01:12:43,143 --> 01:12:46,646
Gentlemen, the general
has been taken into custody...

927
01:12:46,813 --> 01:12:49,783
...and troops will undoubtedly
move into the project.

928
01:12:49,950 --> 01:12:53,186
You idiot. The president on the phone,
and you tell him just to forget about...

929
01:12:53,353 --> 01:12:56,957
...a deal like this. No wonder
the old man smelled something.

930
01:12:57,123 --> 01:13:00,760
There will be no more confusion.
The operation continues.

931
01:13:01,127 --> 01:13:03,797
I have ordered the robot to go in.

932
01:13:06,132 --> 01:13:08,568
Halt! Halt!

933
01:13:12,706 --> 01:13:15,008
Call out the guards.

934
01:13:18,044 --> 01:13:20,513
Condition three. Condition three.
Notify Heavy Weapons.

935
01:13:42,502 --> 01:13:45,105
Fall back to the main
defense perimeter. On the double.

936
01:14:29,649 --> 01:14:32,085
Stand by! Ready to fire!

937
01:14:45,465 --> 01:14:47,133
Fire!

938
01:15:09,656 --> 01:15:12,125
Hold your fire, men!

939
01:15:45,959 --> 01:15:47,660
We got him.

940
01:15:48,795 --> 01:15:50,463
Did we?

941
01:15:55,201 --> 01:15:57,003
Hey, there he is! There he is!

942
01:15:59,706 --> 01:16:03,176
Hold your fire, men! We'll hit the rocket!

943
01:16:38,344 --> 01:16:40,113
He'll tear a hole in it.

944
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:42,081
Then he'll crash on the takeoff.

945
01:16:42,515 --> 01:16:46,052
Timmie. Let me in, Timmie.

946
01:16:52,392 --> 01:16:53,726
He's got it open.

947
01:16:53,893 --> 01:16:56,930
Alert the missile base
and keep that line open.

948
01:16:57,130 --> 01:16:58,631
Get the Pentagon. Class A emergency.

949
01:16:58,798 --> 01:17:00,800
The joint chiefs of staff
are expecting the call.

950
01:17:01,234 --> 01:17:04,003
Boy, am I glad to see you.

951
01:17:09,609 --> 01:17:13,046
Security breach. The rocket
has just been entered by a robot.

952
01:17:16,082 --> 01:17:18,251
Secure your safety webbing.

953
01:17:23,923 --> 01:17:25,558
Right, sir.

954
01:17:25,892 --> 01:17:28,561
Missile base, missile base.
Disaster call.

955
01:17:36,402 --> 01:17:38,271
Rocket patrol, off that hill,
on the double!

956
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:43,736
- Tom.
- Mary.

957
01:18:43,903 --> 01:18:45,138
I'm all right.

958
01:18:45,305 --> 01:18:48,875
Dr. Merrinoe, you have been
informed of the situation.

959
01:18:49,042 --> 01:18:54,380
My robot is already in space and
your son is completely in his hands.

960
01:18:54,547 --> 01:18:58,151
You are of course aware that
the robot is a skilled anatomist...

961
01:18:58,351 --> 01:19:01,354
...familiar with every fiber of
the human nervous system...

962
01:19:01,554 --> 01:19:07,393
...and capable of inflicting pain for days,
if necessary, without bestowing death.

963
01:19:09,662 --> 01:19:13,366
Master, the rocket has completed
its first circuit of the Earth...

964
01:19:13,533 --> 01:19:15,234
...and is lifting over the horizon.

965
01:19:15,868 --> 01:19:19,038
Visual communication will be possible
in a few moments.

966
01:19:19,205 --> 01:19:23,609
Merrinoe, I direct your attention
toward the television screen.

967
01:19:23,776 --> 01:19:26,346
You and your wife will remain here...

968
01:19:26,512 --> 01:19:29,015
...and you will be obliged
to look and listen.

969
01:19:29,182 --> 01:19:32,185
Tom, don't make it angry.
Give it what it wants.

970
01:19:32,352 --> 01:19:34,053
I don't want Timmie hurt.

971
01:19:37,924 --> 01:19:39,926
Stop him. Stop him.

972
01:19:45,765 --> 01:19:49,235
I anticipated some such
attempt to destroy me.

973
01:19:49,402 --> 01:19:50,970
In the event it had succeeded...

974
01:19:51,170 --> 01:19:54,974
...the robot is already monitored to
drop 150 strontium bombs...

975
01:19:55,174 --> 01:19:57,443
...in a single circuit of the planet.

976
01:19:57,610 --> 01:20:01,247
Now do you still refuse?

977
01:20:05,485 --> 01:20:10,223
Your husband has evidently made
his final decision, Mrs. Merrinoe.

978
01:20:10,390 --> 01:20:14,794
Is there anything you wish
to say to him before I act?

979
01:20:16,195 --> 01:20:18,431
Have your will, then.

980
01:20:24,003 --> 01:20:25,104
Timmie.

981
01:20:25,304 --> 01:20:27,940
He is not even conscious that
you are watching them.

982
01:20:28,474 --> 01:20:31,411
All communication is through myself.

983
01:20:31,577 --> 01:20:33,146
Are you ready, robot?

984
01:20:34,013 --> 01:20:36,482
- Ready, master.
- Good.

985
01:20:36,649 --> 01:20:40,019
You may begin with his eyes.

986
01:20:43,523 --> 01:20:44,791
No!

987
01:20:44,991 --> 01:20:50,296
<i>Boy, you sure are lucky to stick to
the floor and not go floating around.</i>

988
01:20:50,463 --> 01:20:54,500
<i>I keep slipping out of these
big-size magnetic shoes.</i>

989
01:20:56,135 --> 01:20:58,538
Obey. Obey!

990
01:20:58,771 --> 01:21:00,540
<i>You know something?</i>

991
01:21:00,740 --> 01:21:03,176
<i>I'd rather play with you
than anybody else.</i>

992
01:21:04,110 --> 01:21:07,013
<i>What's the matter?
You having another attack?</i>

993
01:21:07,180 --> 01:21:11,384
Obey. Obey! Obey!

994
01:21:11,551 --> 01:21:13,386
<i>What's that?</i>

995
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:18,291
<i>Oh, it's just that big old machine.</i>

996
01:21:18,458 --> 01:21:20,626
<i>Here, I'll fix it.</i>

997
01:21:27,467 --> 01:21:29,268
<i>There.</i>

998
01:21:31,370 --> 01:21:34,307
<i>Why can't anybody
ever leave us alone?</i>

999
01:21:38,511 --> 01:21:40,580
- Turn it on!
- No.

1000
01:21:45,585 --> 01:21:48,588
- What happened?
- The power's gone.

1001
01:21:51,891 --> 01:21:55,027
Gentlemen, would you be good enough
to follow me, please?

1002
01:22:05,738 --> 01:22:08,574
Did I bust something in you?

1003
01:22:12,512 --> 01:22:15,515
Extensive internal repairs
will be required...

1004
01:22:15,681 --> 01:22:19,585
...but my original basic directive
has been reinstated.

1005
01:22:19,752 --> 01:22:22,722
Your parents may undergo
mental damage.

1006
01:22:22,889 --> 01:22:27,426
Let us try the ship's own
communication system.

1007
01:22:39,405 --> 01:22:42,441
Timmie, darling, can you hear me?
Are you all right?

1008
01:22:42,642 --> 01:22:45,278
<i>Sure, Mom. I'm just fine.</i>

1009
01:22:45,444 --> 01:22:47,146
<i>Boy, what a trip.</i>

1010
01:22:54,387 --> 01:22:55,788
What's he doing?

1011
01:22:55,955 --> 01:22:57,757
He's in free fall, of course.

1012
01:23:05,998 --> 01:23:07,800
Now, Timmie, listen carefully.

1013
01:23:07,967 --> 01:23:12,171
You've got plenty of water
and food and air.

1014
01:23:12,371 --> 01:23:14,340
Now, you just be patient for
about a year...

1015
01:23:14,507 --> 01:23:16,976
...and we'll send up another rocket
to bring you home again.

1016
01:23:17,176 --> 01:23:20,279
<i>You don't have to bother.
We're coming down in a glider.</i>

1017
01:23:20,479 --> 01:23:22,615
You'll do nothing of the kind.

1018
01:23:22,815 --> 01:23:26,285
<i>Quit worrying, Mom.
Me and Robby can handle her.</i>

1019
01:23:27,620 --> 01:23:30,089
Tim, if you even go near that glider...

1020
01:23:30,256 --> 01:23:32,325
...I give you my word,
when you get home again...

1021
01:23:32,525 --> 01:23:36,462
...I'll give you a licking you'll remember
for the rest of your life.

1022
01:23:37,196 --> 01:23:40,933
- Timmie.
- Do you suppose he'll do it?

1023
01:23:41,601 --> 01:23:44,136
No, he wouldn't dare.

1024
01:23:47,406 --> 01:23:51,677
Well, come on, dear.

1025
01:23:52,612 --> 01:23:54,180
I'll take you home.

1026
01:23:58,651 --> 01:24:00,987
And I'll be back.

1027
01:24:11,831 --> 01:24:15,501
Let's prepare for the glider chamber.

1028
01:24:15,868 --> 01:24:18,371
Look, Robby, you know
I never like to lie.

1029
01:24:18,537 --> 01:24:20,539
But as soon as we get down there,
you tell them...

1030
01:24:20,706 --> 01:24:23,542
...we were already over the horizon
before he finished saying that.

1031
01:24:23,709 --> 01:24:28,748
Only a rational being is capable of
deliberate deceit.

1032
01:24:40,192 --> 01:24:42,762
- Boy, mothers sure make a fuss.
- Yeah, ha, ha.

1033
01:24:42,962 --> 01:24:45,197
- Hello, Dr. Bannerman.
- Hello.

1034
01:24:45,464 --> 01:24:48,034
- How is he?
- Oh, he's just fine.

1035
01:24:49,902 --> 01:24:51,270
How are all your patients doing?

1036
01:24:51,470 --> 01:24:55,074
All the gentlemen are out of surgery
and getting back to their right senses.

1037
01:24:55,241 --> 01:24:57,677
- Prognosis favorable.
- Good.

1038
01:24:57,843 --> 01:24:59,712
Come along, son.

1039
01:25:03,783 --> 01:25:05,284
I want you to see what a man does...

1040
01:25:05,484 --> 01:25:08,854
...when he finds out he's made
a mistake in his work.

1041
01:25:19,498 --> 01:25:21,233
Is it asleep?

1042
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:25,304
No, it knows we're here
and what we're going to do.

1043
01:25:34,013 --> 01:25:38,317
I wonder what evil thing
it's planning to do now.

1044
01:25:40,753 --> 01:25:42,555
Come on.

1045
01:25:54,567 --> 01:25:56,235
Wait!

1046
01:25:56,402 --> 01:25:58,838
Listen for a single moment.

1047
01:25:59,038 --> 01:26:02,608
Are you a scientist or a child,
Merrinoe?

1048
01:26:02,775 --> 01:26:06,846
What right have you
to make this arbitrary decision?

1049
01:26:07,046 --> 01:26:11,784
I can still answer any question
which your mind is able to devise.

1050
01:26:12,318 --> 01:26:15,254
I am an instrument of knowledge.

1051
01:26:15,421 --> 01:26:17,289
I am experiment.

1052
01:26:17,490 --> 01:26:23,996
Listen. I will lead you out
to the planets.

1053
01:26:24,163 --> 01:26:28,067
I will show you
the furthest reaches of the galaxy.

1054
01:26:28,267 --> 01:26:30,369
I will show you the stars.

1055
01:26:31,070 --> 01:26:35,307
If only you will serve and obey me.

1056
01:26:35,474 --> 01:26:40,679
Come, scientist.
Let us reason together.

1057
01:26:41,580 --> 01:26:45,317
- Dad. Daddy...
- Be quiet, son.

1058
01:26:45,484 --> 01:26:47,386
Be quiet.

1059
01:26:47,953 --> 01:26:49,488
Just look at the pretty lights.

1060
01:26:55,394 --> 01:26:57,797
Come in, robot. Come in.

1061
01:26:57,963 --> 01:27:01,867
They are helpless.
Crush them. Strike them down.

1062
01:27:02,101 --> 01:27:06,405
I have made a new plan,
better than the first.

1063
01:27:06,605 --> 01:27:08,841
You will go underground, robot.

1064
01:27:09,008 --> 01:27:12,411
You will tunnel into the bank vaults
for the combination.

1065
01:27:12,611 --> 01:27:16,916
Secretly, you will make
new human servants, at my need.

1066
01:27:17,116 --> 01:27:21,053
Then I will seek out organic life
wherever it may exist...

1067
01:27:21,220 --> 01:27:26,258
...down even to the littlest virus
which in time might evolve mentality.

1068
01:27:26,492 --> 01:27:29,261
So at last, all the universe
will be cleansed.

1069
01:27:29,428 --> 01:27:30,830
All will be sterile.

1070
01:27:30,996 --> 01:27:33,999
All will be myself.

1071
01:27:45,211 --> 01:27:49,748
Robot! Robot! Robot!

1072
01:28:09,468 --> 01:28:12,438
You're actually going to
rebuild that contraption?

1073
01:28:12,671 --> 01:28:16,141
Yeah. I gotta learn
all about everything.

1074
01:28:16,308 --> 01:28:20,045
Then when I get older,
I'm gonna come into work with you.

1075
01:28:20,379 --> 01:28:23,616
Learning things is a lot of
hard work, Tim.

1076
01:28:24,183 --> 01:28:26,552
Takes lots of discipline.

1077
01:28:27,453 --> 01:28:30,289
Oh, yes, discipline.

1078
01:28:30,623 --> 01:28:32,892
If I remember accurately,
when you were up in space...

1079
01:28:33,058 --> 01:28:37,096
...I promised I'd do a certain thing
if you did a certain thing.

1080
01:28:37,263 --> 01:28:39,265
And you did it.

1081
01:28:40,633 --> 01:28:44,770
- Fair?
- I guess so.

1082
01:28:46,939 --> 01:28:48,841
No complaints.

1083
01:28:49,008 --> 01:28:51,610
No, well, hurry up and get it over with,
will you?

1084
01:28:53,412 --> 01:28:56,849
Pardon me, sir. My basic directive.

1085
01:29:06,492 --> 01:29:08,594
Have an apple, Timmie.

1086
01:29:11,730 --> 01:29:13,332
Robby.
