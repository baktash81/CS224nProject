1
00:01:29,891 --> 00:01:32,527
<i>How does a woman in her 70s</i>

2
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,529
<i>end up getting married?</i>

3
00:01:35,563 --> 00:01:39,366
<i>It all started</i>
<i>when the world shut down.</i>

4
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:47,875
Okay. All I see here is me.

5
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:50,745
This is not what I want
to be looking at.

6
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:52,446
Diane, you're muted.

7
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,617
Seriously, how do I just not see
my own face this big, huh?

8
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:56,918
You're muted.

9
00:01:56,951 --> 00:02:00,622
Diane, you're muted.

10
00:02:00,655 --> 00:02:02,657
Alexa, join my meeting.

11
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:03,925
Okay.

12
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,225
Hello, ladies.

13
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:06,761
-Hello.
-Hi.

14
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:10,497
Viv, have you been at
Arthur's condo this whole time?

15
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:12,265
Nine days.

16
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:13,801
It's a world record.

17
00:02:13,835 --> 00:02:15,837
-Ha!
-Shar.

18
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,404
Are you drinking at work?

19
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:20,340
Well, technically,
the courts are closed,

20
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:23,778
so it's just me
and Judge Walker.

21
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:25,245
My restaurant's closed, too.

22
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:27,347
They said it might be
two whole weeks.

23
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:29,751
Okay, I figured it out.

24
00:02:29,784 --> 00:02:31,653
Why am I a potato?

25
00:02:31,686 --> 00:02:33,220
Ay, ay, ay.

26
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:35,657
Shall we talk about
<i>Normal People?</i>

27
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,258
Something we have
very little experience with.

28
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:41,228
Hey.
How do I stop being a potato?

29
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:43,564
<i>One thing's for sure:</i>

30
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:46,433
<i>It went on longer</i>
<i>than anyone imagined.</i>

31
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:48,468
Ah. <i>Untamed.</i>

32
00:02:48,503 --> 00:02:51,506
The harrowing true story
of Viv's nether region

33
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:54,274
if the waxing salon
doesn't reopen soon.

34
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:55,977
All that's been lasered away
years ago.

35
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,244
Yeah.

36
00:02:57,277 --> 00:03:00,581
Excuse me, um, it's 7:00 p.m.

37
00:03:00,615 --> 00:03:03,283
Oh, my...

38
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:05,385
Thank you, health-care workers!

39
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:08,221
-Yay.
-Thank you!

40
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:11,926
No one's enjoying their
quarantine more than you, Viv.

41
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:13,761
<i>We stayed connected</i>

42
00:03:13,795 --> 00:03:16,764
<i>and were there for each other</i>
<i>through personal hardships.</i>

43
00:03:16,798 --> 00:03:18,833
Look who's home
from the hospital.

44
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:21,002
Bruce, you look great.

45
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:23,705
A minor heart attack.
I'm doing fine.

46
00:03:23,738 --> 00:03:25,940
We're just taking it easy.

47
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:28,308
-No more cheeseburgers.
-Mm-hmm.

48
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:29,844
Oh, yeah, but look.

49
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:32,947
Got these special cookies.

50
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,348
They're shaped like an aorta.

51
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:36,584
Ugh.

52
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:39,386
No.

53
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:42,790
<i>And through</i>
<i>professional milestones.</i>

54
00:03:48,863 --> 00:03:50,464
Ta-da.

55
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:53,400
I've already been asked
to perform three weddings.

56
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:56,037
Once you take senior status,
that's all you're good for.

57
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,039
-That's so sweet.
-It's degrading.

58
00:03:58,072 --> 00:04:00,508
I didn't go to law school
so I could tell

59
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:03,477
the children of my colleagues
they could kiss.

60
00:04:03,511 --> 00:04:05,479
<i>And like so many people,</i>

61
00:04:05,513 --> 00:04:09,282
<i>the time apart gave us the</i>
<i>opportunity to try new things.</i>

62
00:04:13,988 --> 00:04:15,890
That was a little dark, but...

63
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:19,026
I'm pickling my own cucumbers.

64
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,762
Oh! Oh!

65
00:04:21,996 --> 00:04:24,364
I have adopted a rescue parrot.

66
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:26,901
His name is Sylvester.

67
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,770
Are you a good boy?

68
00:04:29,737 --> 00:04:31,606
Sylvester's been rehomed.

69
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,641
<i>And forced us</i>
<i>to deal with things</i>

70
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:35,743
<i>we'd been putting off.</i>

71
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:38,411
This is all I'm keeping.

72
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,648
Well, good you're hanging on
to that coffee can, though.

73
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:42,650
Oh.

74
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:44,417
This is Harry.

75
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,520
Harry?

76
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:49,489
Well, yeah, the ashes.
The-the ashes of Harry. See?

77
00:04:49,524 --> 00:04:52,325
Was his dying wish
to be a latte?

78
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:53,795
You-you can't just
leave him there.

79
00:04:53,828 --> 00:04:55,563
Wait a minute.
Do you think he's better off

80
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:57,397
on the mantel
in Mitchell's bedroom?

81
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,332
Probably not
what your late husband imagined

82
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:01,702
as his eternal resting place.

83
00:05:01,736 --> 00:05:03,671
Back in the box you go.

84
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:04,939
There you go.

85
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:06,507
No, go spread them somewhere.

86
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,375
Well, what am I supposed to do?

87
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,410
I mean, I'm just supposed to go
dump him in the fields?

88
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,880
He's allergic to horses.

89
00:05:12,914 --> 00:05:14,849
<i>For a while, it felt like</i>

90
00:05:14,882 --> 00:05:16,551
<i>it was never going to end.</i>

91
00:05:16,584 --> 00:05:19,687
I liked this,
but if I wanted to read a story

92
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,090
of a woman trapped at home,
slowly going crazy,

93
00:05:23,124 --> 00:05:25,560
I would've read my own diaries.

94
00:05:25,593 --> 00:05:29,429
<i>But everything</i>
<i>comes to an end at some point.</i>

95
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:32,767
We had a great run, didn't we?

96
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,769
It was the best restaurant
in Brentwood.

97
00:05:34,802 --> 00:05:37,404
It was the best
restaurant in Los Angeles.

98
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,106
-Yeah, definitely.
-That's true.

99
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,576
You guys are nice.

100
00:05:41,609 --> 00:05:44,111
Well, I was gonna retire
someday anyway.

101
00:05:44,145 --> 00:05:46,547
Come join me on the other side.

102
00:05:46,581 --> 00:05:48,983
It's boring, but it's boring.

103
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:51,085
Yeah.

104
00:05:51,118 --> 00:05:52,920
<i>Well, it had been</i>
<i>quite an experience,</i>

105
00:05:52,954 --> 00:05:57,124
<i>but our time apart</i>
<i>was finally coming to an end,</i>

106
00:05:57,158 --> 00:06:00,595
<i>and a new journey together</i>
<i>was about to begin.</i>

107
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:11,105
Knock, knock!

108
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,743
Oh, my God.

109
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:17,011
Oh!

110
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:19,080
This still feels illegal.

111
00:06:19,113 --> 00:06:21,115
Oh, no.

112
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:23,450
-Yeah. -I refuse to outlaw
the hug.

113
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:25,485
What's going on here, huh?

114
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,054
Have we officially hit the stage

115
00:06:27,088 --> 00:06:28,990
where we cover
our furniture in plastic?

116
00:06:29,023 --> 00:06:30,658
No, this is what happens
when you have

117
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:32,660
-too much time on your hands.
-Yeah.

118
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:34,962
I actually tried
to retile the bathroom, too.

119
00:06:34,996 --> 00:06:37,031
-Oh.
-That did not go well.

120
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,633
-No?
-It's terrible.

121
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,568
-Yoo-hoo.
-Oh!

122
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:42,670
-Judge!
-Oh, please.

123
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:45,640
I'm retired,
so no need for formalities.

124
00:06:45,673 --> 00:06:47,575
-"Your Honor" is fine.
-Oh.

125
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:50,811
I never thought I'd be
this happy to hug you. Oh.

126
00:06:50,845 --> 00:06:52,780
Yeah. I get that a lot.

127
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:54,515
Hello!

128
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:56,183
-Oh! Hello.
-Oh, my God.

129
00:06:56,217 --> 00:06:59,053
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, I'm so happy to see you.

130
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,022
-Oh, my God. Oh, hi.
-Hi.

131
00:07:01,055 --> 00:07:02,523
Hi, sweetheart.

132
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:03,925
-Hi.
-Aw.

133
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:06,127
-And my pal.
-Hey, Slim.

134
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,795
Oh, this is so great.

135
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:10,197
-How are you, Slim?
-I'm so excited.

136
00:07:10,231 --> 00:07:12,133
Viv, uh, just one question.

137
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,668
What's going on with the gloves?

138
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:15,569
Are you planning
a jewelry heist?

139
00:07:15,603 --> 00:07:18,873
Or maybe becoming
an amateur mime?

140
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:20,207
Or even a professional mime,

141
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:21,809
-if you put your mind to it.
-Uh-huh.

142
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:23,577
Now, that would be
an exciting change.

143
00:07:23,611 --> 00:07:28,215
Well, actually, there has been
an exciting change.

144
00:07:28,249 --> 00:07:30,918
Oh, my.

145
00:07:30,952 --> 00:07:32,186
What's going... What?

146
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:33,587
Oh, my God.

147
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:35,122
-You're engaged?
-Oh, it's gorgeous.

148
00:07:35,156 --> 00:07:37,558
-Can you believe it?
-No, I can't.

149
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:39,160
-Vivian.
-Oh, I have so many questions.

150
00:07:40,995 --> 00:07:42,229
-When did this happen?
-Well...

151
00:07:42,263 --> 00:07:44,131
Wait, wait, wait.
Come sit down and tell us

152
00:07:44,165 --> 00:07:45,533
-every single thing.
-We need details.

153
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:46,767
-Yeah, okay.
-Okay.

154
00:07:46,801 --> 00:07:48,636
Oh, my God, Viv,
this is amazing.

155
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:50,171
Oh, no.

156
00:07:50,204 --> 00:07:53,908
Oh, my God. Well, uh, it was
actually... it was last night.

157
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:55,776
I can't believe
that it was last night.

158
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,712
We were walking back
to the apartment,

159
00:07:57,745 --> 00:08:00,214
and he made some comment
about proposing,

160
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:02,984
and I made a comment,
"Well, if not now, when?"

161
00:08:03,017 --> 00:08:04,986
Because in another 50 years,

162
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:08,289
I may not find him
as attractive as I do now.

163
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:11,792
And right then, we were
in front of a jewelry store.

164
00:08:11,826 --> 00:08:14,261
And before I know it,
we're in the store,

165
00:08:14,295 --> 00:08:16,263
saying, "Should we do this?

166
00:08:16,297 --> 00:08:18,766
I mean, should we get married?"

167
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:20,301
And we are!

168
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:23,137
-Oh, my God. Oh!
-We are.

169
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,905
-Please.
-Oh.

170
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:26,741
To Viv and Arthur.

171
00:08:26,774 --> 00:08:28,209
Oh, thank you.

172
00:08:28,242 --> 00:08:29,877
-Cheers.
-Oh, beautiful.

173
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,045
Thank you, my pals.

174
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:32,613
So, do you have a date yet?

175
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:34,148
Oh, I think I'll go with Arthur.

176
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:35,883
What?

177
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,284
As my date.

178
00:08:37,318 --> 00:08:38,886
Do we have to laugh
at her bad jokes

179
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,154
-since she's the bride?
-No, well, I think we do.

180
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,255
-I think that's the rule.
-Yeah.

181
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:42,923
Sharon is correct.

182
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:45,626
Look at you.

183
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:47,762
-Is this new?
-Well, it is to me.

184
00:08:47,795 --> 00:08:50,865
I assume the man who owns it
purchased it years ago.

185
00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:55,169
Oh, well, I'm glad your vagina
hasn't claimed senior status.

186
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:57,204
-Who's the lucky sailor?
-Not a clue.

187
00:08:57,238 --> 00:09:00,608
I found it in the back seat
of my car. Finders keepers.

188
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:02,710
Oh, my God.

189
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:04,979
I really don't understand
how you make that work.

190
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:07,782
Well, now you know why she keeps
having to get her hip replaced.

191
00:09:07,815 --> 00:09:10,985
People with mechanical knees
should not throw stones.

192
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:15,723
-Oh. Oh, my God, you guys.
-What? What?

193
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:20,261
I have to show you what I found
when I was cleaning up.

194
00:09:20,294 --> 00:09:23,064
Cleaning up?
What did it look like before?

195
00:09:23,097 --> 00:09:24,932
Look. I think it's an omen.

196
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:26,267
An omen?

197
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,370
This is from the trip
that never was.

198
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,872
Remember, we were all
gonna go to Italy.

199
00:09:31,906 --> 00:09:33,074
Oh.

200
00:09:33,107 --> 00:09:34,742
Oh, Italy.

201
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:36,377
-Right?
-Oh, my God.

202
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,245
Our dream vacation,
before, of course,

203
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,347
I got pregnant
and ruined everything.

204
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:42,716
Pan Am?

205
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,285
Can you believe
that one of these

206
00:09:44,318 --> 00:09:46,187
used to get us on a plane?

207
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,889
I can't even look at those.

208
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:50,791
"Surprise Gianni.

209
00:09:50,825 --> 00:09:53,060
Taste his magical
meatballs again."

210
00:09:53,094 --> 00:09:54,261
Oh.

211
00:09:54,295 --> 00:09:56,230
-"Do not live in fear."
-Oh, God.

212
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:57,798
Okay, that's not...

213
00:09:57,832 --> 00:09:59,967
-"Taste his magical meatballs"?
-Shh!

214
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,336
"Do not live in fear"?
How big are they?

215
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:04,238
Oh, Gianni.

216
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:05,673
Who is Gianni?

217
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:07,174
Okay, he was the Italian hottie

218
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:10,778
from my cooking school
a million trillion years ago.

219
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:12,413
Probably fat and bald now.

220
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:14,381
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-Don't ruin my memories.

221
00:10:14,415 --> 00:10:15,916
Anyway, that's not the point.

222
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,652
-The point is I found this.
-Yeah.

223
00:10:18,686 --> 00:10:21,055
The travel ban is lifted,

224
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:23,324
and I think
we should all go to Italy.

225
00:10:23,357 --> 00:10:25,392
Italy? Whoa.

226
00:10:25,426 --> 00:10:26,994
I mean, I barely made it here.

227
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:29,263
Yeah, I-I-I can't go
anywhere, right?

228
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:31,732
I'm a newly engaged woman,
remember?

229
00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:33,801
Oh, that-that's it.

230
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:36,270
We'll make it
Viv's bachelorette.

231
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:38,372
Oh, I literally
just got chill bumps.

232
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:40,107
It's perfect.

233
00:10:40,141 --> 00:10:42,743
You want us to run around Italy
like a bunch of teenagers?

234
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:46,747
The book says ignoring the signs
is what ruins a life.

235
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,283
-We can't reject our destiny.
-Yeah.

236
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:51,819
I love the idea
of drinking Italian wine

237
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:53,821
and celebrating Vivian,

238
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:56,290
but can't we just do that
from here?

239
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:58,159
I'm with Shar.

240
00:10:58,192 --> 00:11:00,995
You know, it-it doesn't feel
right leaving Arthur right now.

241
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:03,797
And my little Ginsburger
has not been feeling well.

242
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:05,933
-I don't feel good about
leaving her, either. -Mm.

243
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:08,802
You know that we might never
have a chance

244
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:11,205
to do something like this again.

245
00:11:12,206 --> 00:11:14,208
Such is fate.

246
00:11:15,743 --> 00:11:17,244
<i>A bachelorette?</i>

247
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:20,181
And you said you didn't
want to go because of me?

248
00:11:20,214 --> 00:11:23,284
No. Well, I mean, yeah,
that's what I said,

249
00:11:23,317 --> 00:11:24,418
but not because of you.

250
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:25,886
Because of us.

251
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,388
-Well...
-You know, our relationship.

252
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:29,823
Well, that's not right.

253
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:32,826
Not because of
"our relationship."

254
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,261
Because of our engagement.

255
00:11:34,295 --> 00:11:36,897
I mean, my point was
we're engaged,

256
00:11:36,931 --> 00:11:38,432
so if I'm gonna run off
to Italy,

257
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:40,100
it should be with you.

258
00:11:40,134 --> 00:11:42,870
Well, I'd love that,
but just 'cause we're engaged

259
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:45,406
doesn't mean you can't go on
a trip with your best friends.

260
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:47,107
Really?

261
00:11:47,141 --> 00:11:48,475
Viv, Jesus Christ.

262
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,411
Actually, that is
Saint Christopher.

263
00:11:50,444 --> 00:11:51,845
Oh, God.

264
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,515
He's the patron saint of travel.

265
00:11:53,548 --> 00:11:55,416
So, if you're planning a trip,

266
00:11:55,449 --> 00:11:57,751
well, this is
the right place to start.

267
00:11:57,785 --> 00:12:00,087
-How about that for a sign?
-Wow.

268
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:04,124
Oh, boy.

269
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,331
Hello. You've reached the home
of the retired and gifted.

270
00:12:10,364 --> 00:12:12,266
So...

271
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:14,969
we need to go to Italy.

272
00:12:15,002 --> 00:12:17,539
Why are you saying that?
I already told you I can't go.

273
00:12:17,572 --> 00:12:19,173
I wanted to score a few points

274
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:20,941
by telling Arthur
that I wasn't gonna go

275
00:12:20,975 --> 00:12:23,244
because I'm being sensitive
to his feelings

276
00:12:23,277 --> 00:12:25,312
now that we're "en-fianced."

277
00:12:25,346 --> 00:12:27,181
That's not a word.

278
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:28,983
"En-fianced," "a-fianced."

279
00:12:29,016 --> 00:12:31,352
I-I don't know.

280
00:12:32,286 --> 00:12:33,988
Where are you?

281
00:12:34,021 --> 00:12:35,456
I'm in a church.

282
00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:37,391
You're in a church?

283
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:39,093
We're looking for a venue
for the wedding.

284
00:12:39,126 --> 00:12:42,029
You're going to get married
in a church?

285
00:12:42,062 --> 00:12:44,566
Hope they don't run
a background check.

286
00:12:44,599 --> 00:12:46,467
I'm shocked you didn't
burst into flames

287
00:12:46,501 --> 00:12:48,202
as you crossed the threshold.

288
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:50,971
The point is, Sharon,
now if we don't go,

289
00:12:51,005 --> 00:12:52,806
he'll think I think
he was testing me

290
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,009
and that I don't think
he actually thinks we should go.

291
00:12:55,042 --> 00:12:57,177
I-I think
you're overthinking this.

292
00:12:57,211 --> 00:12:58,479
I don't think so.

293
00:12:58,513 --> 00:13:00,447
-I think we need to go.
-Ginsie.

294
00:13:00,481 --> 00:13:02,249
-Honey, it's Sharon. Say hi.
-Ginsie.

295
00:13:02,283 --> 00:13:03,817
Oh, hey. Hi, Sharon.

296
00:13:03,851 --> 00:13:05,819
I'm excited about
your trip to Italy.

297
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:07,388
Oh, my God.

298
00:13:07,421 --> 00:13:09,223
Oh, shit.

299
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:13,294
Oh, Sh-Sharon,
y-you're on speaker in a church.

300
00:13:13,327 --> 00:13:14,596
Ginsie.

301
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:16,964
Jesus fucking Christ.

302
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:19,166
Uh, I'll call you back.

303
00:13:21,335 --> 00:13:22,903
It's another omen.

304
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:24,506
I don't understand.

305
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:26,206
Dead like dead-dead?

306
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,976
Yes. What other kind
of dead is there?

307
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:30,612
Don't cats have nine lives?

308
00:13:30,645 --> 00:13:33,047
Ho-Hold on. Sharon's coming.

309
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,183
They think it was just old age.

310
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:40,154
It's unnatural for your child
to go before you.

311
00:13:40,187 --> 00:13:41,455
Aw, honey.

312
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,457
-Honey, I'm so sorry.
-Oh.

313
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,492
Well, I'm-I'm just on
with Diane.

314
00:13:45,527 --> 00:13:46,927
I'll put her on speaker.

315
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,362
Oh, no, no, no,
wait, wait, wait, no, no.

316
00:13:48,395 --> 00:13:49,997
I would just say
the wrong thing.

317
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:50,998
Hi, Di.

318
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:55,035
No, even my name is wrong
at a time like this.

319
00:13:55,069 --> 00:13:57,338
I think this might be an omen.

320
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:01,208
Yes, the universe is conspiring.

321
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:02,476
I mean, is... Oh, God.

322
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,178
Is it? Is it really?

323
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:08,349
And even if it's not,
I say we discuss it in Italy.

324
00:14:08,382 --> 00:14:09,383
Are you serious?

325
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,519
I'm retired. My cat is dead.

326
00:14:11,553 --> 00:14:13,887
We're talking about
going to the top

327
00:14:13,921 --> 00:14:15,889
wine-producing country
in the world.

328
00:14:15,923 --> 00:14:18,359
Yes, I'm serious.

329
00:14:18,392 --> 00:14:19,627
Let's do this.

330
00:14:19,661 --> 00:14:21,563
I'm looping in Viv.

331
00:14:21,596 --> 00:14:24,365
We have to go to Italy.

332
00:14:24,398 --> 00:14:26,033
You're in, too?

333
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:27,535
Didn't Sharon tell you
what happened?

334
00:14:27,569 --> 00:14:30,471
-About her cat?
-No. Arthur.

335
00:14:30,505 --> 00:14:32,306
Oh, God. Did he die, too?

336
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:33,641
Diane.

337
00:14:33,675 --> 00:14:35,643
I was worried there was a theme.

338
00:14:35,677 --> 00:14:38,479
He thinks it would be wrong
for us not to go.

339
00:14:38,513 --> 00:14:40,414
I mean, is that sweet or what?

340
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:42,383
You should marry that guy.

341
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:43,551
And I will.

342
00:14:43,585 --> 00:14:45,553
But first, Italy.

343
00:14:45,587 --> 00:14:47,921
Can you believe it?

344
00:14:47,955 --> 00:14:50,057
You're on your way to Tuscany.

345
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,292
Ugh. God.

346
00:14:52,326 --> 00:14:54,194
-"Ugh"?
-Ugh, I know.

347
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:56,430
You're the first person
in the world to "ugh" Tuscany.

348
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:58,633
I wasn't "ugh-ing" Tuscany.

349
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:00,167
Ah, nice try.

350
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,603
There's just an absurdity
to the whole thing.

351
00:15:01,636 --> 00:15:04,004
A bachelorette trip?
What are we doing?

352
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:05,673
Well, Vivian's getting married.

353
00:15:05,707 --> 00:15:08,308
Which is, you know,
a little bit nuts.

354
00:15:09,176 --> 00:15:11,011
I think it's very romantic.

355
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:12,547
But it's also nuts.

356
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,148
You got to admit that.

357
00:15:14,181 --> 00:15:15,949
Well, you're the one
who's been married before.

358
00:15:15,983 --> 00:15:16,984
You tell me.

359
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:18,419
No, no. I was pregnant.

360
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:19,554
It's different.

361
00:15:19,587 --> 00:15:21,388
Oh, that's so romantic.

362
00:15:21,422 --> 00:15:24,324
Not as romantic as
never getting married at all.

363
00:15:25,693 --> 00:15:27,461
Hello?

364
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:29,029
One little goodbye kiss, maybe?

365
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:30,364
-A little goodbye...
-Maybe one.

366
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:31,699
Oh, excited.

367
00:15:31,733 --> 00:15:34,435
Oh. Mm.

368
00:15:34,468 --> 00:15:36,236
Mmm.

369
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:39,106
-Get out of here.
-Uh-huh. Okay.

370
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:40,441
Love you.

371
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,098
Look at this place.

372
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:40,033
I can't believe
we're actually here.

373
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:41,769
I love this city.

374
00:16:41,803 --> 00:16:44,438
Rome. Roma.

375
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:48,041
And not just because I had
<i>due</i> proseccos at lunch.

376
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:49,611
Yeah, sure.

377
00:16:49,644 --> 00:16:54,749
Me, too. I love anything that's
falling apart more than I am.

378
00:16:54,782 --> 00:16:56,518
You know,

379
00:16:56,551 --> 00:16:58,185
it's amazing, though, isn't it,

380
00:16:58,218 --> 00:16:59,821
how many tourists there are
in the world?

381
00:16:59,854 --> 00:17:01,689
Well, wait a minute.
We're tourists.

382
00:17:01,723 --> 00:17:03,290
-Yes, but we're different.
-Oh.

383
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:05,125
-We're not so obvious.
-Yeah.

384
00:17:05,158 --> 00:17:09,196
No, no, no. Judge's fanny pack
screams, "I'm a local."

385
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:11,833
-It's called a waist wallet.
-Oh.

386
00:17:11,866 --> 00:17:13,701
Oh, well, that changes
everything.

387
00:17:13,735 --> 00:17:16,303
Yeah, and it's not just fashion.

388
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:19,406
-It's also functional.
-No. Ah...

389
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,208
Hey, is it time?

390
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:22,777
-What?
-Oh, yeah. No, no.

391
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:25,078
-It is time.
-Okay.

392
00:17:25,112 --> 00:17:26,681
-What?
-Uh-huh.

393
00:17:26,714 --> 00:17:29,717
-Oh, yes.
-Let's do it.

394
00:17:29,751 --> 00:17:31,753
-Oh, my God, you...
-Yes, yes!

395
00:17:31,786 --> 00:17:33,353
Oh, I can't believe you guys.

396
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:37,559
Well, believe it, because
this is your bachelorette.

397
00:17:37,592 --> 00:17:39,159
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah.

398
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:41,161
And we're not gonna
let you forget it, okay?

399
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:42,764
-Oh, and there's a veil.
-Oh. Oh, yeah.

400
00:17:42,797 --> 00:17:44,298
Oh, my Lord.

401
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:45,567
-Congratulations to the bride!
-There you go.

402
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,734
Oh, thank you.

403
00:17:46,768 --> 00:17:48,201
-Thank you, thank you.
-Thank you.

404
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:50,170
Oh, God, you look so great.

405
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:51,873
You look perfect.

406
00:17:51,906 --> 00:17:54,174
I look like
a crossing guard in this.

407
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:56,844
No, crossing guards
wear vests now.

408
00:18:02,584 --> 00:18:03,885
What did he say?

409
00:18:03,918 --> 00:18:05,520
I'm-I'm trying...
I'm trying to translate here.

410
00:18:05,553 --> 00:18:07,889
Oh, okay, <i>"vecchie."</i>
It means "old."

411
00:18:07,922 --> 00:18:09,524
-What?
-Yeah.

412
00:18:09,557 --> 00:18:11,726
-Oh.
-He called us old?

413
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:13,861
He basically called us
an old fruit.

414
00:18:13,895 --> 00:18:15,362
Oh, my...

415
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:17,197
I'm gonna cause
an international incident.

416
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,433
-Wait. <i>"Dolce"</i> means "sweet."
-Yeah. What?

417
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:23,871
Okay. "The older the vines,
the sweeter the fruit."

418
00:18:23,905 --> 00:18:27,240
Oh!

419
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:29,611
-Yes, we've still got it.
-Look at us.

420
00:18:29,644 --> 00:18:30,912
Yeah, we got it.

421
00:18:30,945 --> 00:18:32,714
The question is:
What are we gonna do with it?

422
00:18:32,747 --> 00:18:34,214
Well, this is
a bachelorette party,

423
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:35,482
-so you know what that means.
-Okay.

424
00:18:35,516 --> 00:18:38,820
It means that we go
see naked men.

425
00:18:41,956 --> 00:18:44,324
What's the protocol here?

426
00:18:44,358 --> 00:18:47,562
Where do I stuff
the dollar bills?

427
00:18:47,595 --> 00:18:49,931
I-I think some of these guys
are the same dancers

428
00:18:49,964 --> 00:18:52,533
from my bachelorette party.

429
00:18:53,935 --> 00:18:55,903
Look at those nail beds.

430
00:18:57,939 --> 00:18:59,741
I really need a pedicure.

431
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:05,546
"I lost my hand!"

432
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,649
Nic Cage, <i>Moonstruck.</i>

433
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:11,552
Oh, wow.

434
00:19:12,654 --> 00:19:14,922
She's almost 2,000 years old.

435
00:19:14,956 --> 00:19:17,692
She's definitely had work done.

436
00:19:19,493 --> 00:19:22,797
I got the same perm
back in 1982.

437
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:31,271
In his defense,
it is a little chilly in here.

438
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:32,439
Give him some credit.

439
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:33,908
I mean,
he's a thousand years old

440
00:19:33,941 --> 00:19:35,710
and still hard as a rock.

441
00:19:35,743 --> 00:19:37,244
Oh, my God.

442
00:19:37,277 --> 00:19:39,279
What is Bruce doing?

443
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:41,281
Wait a minute.
Are you spying on him?

444
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:42,850
No, no, I got an alert.

445
00:19:42,884 --> 00:19:45,318
There was movement
in the kitchen.

446
00:19:46,587 --> 00:19:47,689
Bacon?

447
00:19:47,722 --> 00:19:49,791
Oh, God. He can't...

448
00:19:49,824 --> 00:19:51,425
What, is he insane?

449
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,561
-Oh, <i>uno momen...</i>
-Bruce!

450
00:19:56,496 --> 00:19:58,666
Carol, you scared
the hell out of me.

451
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,870
Bruce, you know you're not
allowed to eat bacon.

452
00:20:02,904 --> 00:20:04,772
No, no, it's not
what it looks like.

453
00:20:04,806 --> 00:20:07,575
It looks like you're hiding
bacon behind your back.

454
00:20:07,608 --> 00:20:09,577
Wrong.

455
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:11,478
No bacon.

456
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:16,450
I see you, Bruce.

457
00:20:18,986 --> 00:20:20,655
Oh, oh.

458
00:20:20,688 --> 00:20:24,525
-Oh... Oh, whoa.
-Wow.

459
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:29,731
I've never seen
anything like it.

460
00:20:29,764 --> 00:20:32,033
I'm so glad we did this.

461
00:20:32,066 --> 00:20:33,467
-Me, too.
-Aw.

462
00:20:33,501 --> 00:20:35,603
-Me, too.
-Mwah.

463
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:39,741
Oh, look. Here we go.

464
00:20:39,774 --> 00:20:41,308
This is Via dei Coronari.

465
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:44,011
-Oh.
-What's Via dei Coronari?

466
00:20:44,045 --> 00:20:46,480
-This road.
-So?

467
00:20:46,514 --> 00:20:49,349
So it's-it's beautiful
and we're taking it.

468
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:52,053
Wha... I don't think
there's an ugly street

469
00:20:52,086 --> 00:20:53,755
-in this entire city, is there?
-No.

470
00:20:53,788 --> 00:20:55,656
-No. Right.
-I don't think so.

471
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,491
-Ah, and-and look.
-Oh.

472
00:20:58,993 --> 00:21:00,661
Is it a sign?

473
00:21:00,695 --> 00:21:01,929
Oh, I think it is.

474
00:21:01,963 --> 00:21:04,966
I think it is definitely a sign.

475
00:21:06,901 --> 00:21:08,903
That is a sign, literally.

476
00:21:08,936 --> 00:21:10,370
<i>"Chiuso."</i> Closed.

477
00:21:10,403 --> 00:21:12,640
-Oh, shucks.
-Hmm.

478
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:19,379
And you must be the bride.

479
00:21:19,412 --> 00:21:22,282
Well, how did you know?

480
00:21:23,084 --> 00:21:25,686
What did you gals do?

481
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,456
Welcome to
my humble little factory.

482
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:31,626
-Wow.
<i>-Grazie.</i>

483
00:21:31,659 --> 00:21:33,094
-Wow.
-Oh. Whoa.

484
00:21:33,127 --> 00:21:34,529
Oh, my gosh.

485
00:21:34,562 --> 00:21:36,998
So, describe to me the dress.

486
00:21:37,031 --> 00:21:39,734
Tell me anything
that comes to your mind.

487
00:21:39,767 --> 00:21:41,869
Sexy but traditional.

488
00:21:41,903 --> 00:21:43,638
Sexy. <i>Naturalmente,</i> of course.

489
00:21:43,671 --> 00:21:46,406
-No, and timeless.
-That's a good call.

490
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:48,408
The last thing you want
when you look back

491
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:49,844
at your photos 50 years from now

492
00:21:49,877 --> 00:21:52,880
is to wonder,
"What the hell was I thinking?"

493
00:21:52,914 --> 00:21:54,549
Right.

494
00:21:54,582 --> 00:21:56,751
Ciao. Can I interest anyone
in a prosecco?

495
00:21:56,784 --> 00:21:58,052
-Yes, you bet.
-Yes.

496
00:21:58,085 --> 00:22:00,855
Me, and you should be
interested, too.

497
00:22:00,888 --> 00:22:01,956
Oh, yeah.

498
00:22:03,591 --> 00:22:06,027
Well, uh, let's have
some fun, girls, huh?

499
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,762
To fun.

500
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:14,535
Oh, gorgeous. Oh.

501
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,373
Is this it?

502
00:22:20,407 --> 00:22:21,509
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

503
00:22:21,542 --> 00:22:23,578
You don't pick the first one.

504
00:22:23,611 --> 00:22:25,780
You're not getting off
that easily.

505
00:22:25,813 --> 00:22:28,716
-It's too bridal.
-Mmm.

506
00:22:28,749 --> 00:22:29,817
Next.

507
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,488
You look like Hugh Hefner.

508
00:22:35,523 --> 00:22:36,991
It's not bridal enough.

509
00:22:37,024 --> 00:22:38,025
I think you should change.

510
00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:39,392
Next.

511
00:22:39,426 --> 00:22:41,562
Thank you so much.

512
00:22:46,934 --> 00:22:50,403
God, I'd like to serve you
for Christmas dinner.

513
00:22:50,437 --> 00:22:51,873
Oh, my God.

514
00:22:51,906 --> 00:22:54,407
-Okay. Less bird. Next.
-Mm-hmm.

515
00:22:54,441 --> 00:22:56,143
Someone else next.

516
00:22:56,177 --> 00:22:58,445
Fine. When in Rome.

517
00:22:58,478 --> 00:23:00,447
I'm not putting on
one other thing

518
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,884
until you're all in couture.

519
00:23:02,917 --> 00:23:05,485
You're not getting out of this.

520
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:07,922
Correction:
I'm not getting into this.

521
00:23:07,955 --> 00:23:09,690
Grace.

522
00:23:11,926 --> 00:23:14,896
-You know...
<i>-Sì.</i> I know just the one.

523
00:23:17,899 --> 00:23:19,033
Ta-da.

524
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:20,768
Oh, my... Oh.

525
00:23:20,801 --> 00:23:24,038
I feel like I just escaped
from the trunk of a Cadillac.

526
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:31,444
Judge, looking good.

527
00:23:31,478 --> 00:23:34,815
Yeah, if I were at
a Renaissance fair.

528
00:23:35,983 --> 00:23:38,753
Oh, Diane, look.

529
00:23:40,821 --> 00:23:44,058
I literally thought
that was you.

530
00:23:44,091 --> 00:23:46,193
-I love that.
-It's...

531
00:23:46,227 --> 00:23:48,796
So, what do you think?

532
00:23:48,829 --> 00:23:50,698
That I don't like you.

533
00:23:51,565 --> 00:23:54,035
-Aw.
-Holy moly.

534
00:23:54,068 --> 00:23:55,703
-Gorgeous.
-Oh, Diane.

535
00:23:55,736 --> 00:23:58,706
You look more like you
than you ever have.

536
00:23:58,739 --> 00:23:59,740
We are sending

537
00:23:59,774 --> 00:24:01,776
a picture of this to Mitchell.

538
00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:04,211
No, no, no, no.
Wait a minute. Are you nuts?

539
00:24:04,245 --> 00:24:06,147
-Too late.
-Please don't send it.

540
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,782
Sharon, un-send it.

541
00:24:07,815 --> 00:24:10,251
Just because I know
how to not make myself a potato

542
00:24:10,284 --> 00:24:12,553
doesn't mean I'm Steve Jobs.

543
00:24:12,586 --> 00:24:14,555
I mean...

544
00:24:14,588 --> 00:24:16,857
Another one for the bride-to-be.

545
00:24:16,891 --> 00:24:18,491
Okay, I need more drink.

546
00:24:18,526 --> 00:24:20,460
Oh, my God.

547
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:23,698
Whoa.

548
00:24:23,731 --> 00:24:25,933
-Whoa.
-Oh, no way.

549
00:24:25,967 --> 00:24:28,636
Slim, yowza.

550
00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:30,571
Oh, my God, I'd marry you.

551
00:24:30,604 --> 00:24:33,007
Oh, my gosh, Viv, it's stunning.

552
00:24:34,608 --> 00:24:37,979
Is it how you always
imagined yourself as a bride?

553
00:24:38,012 --> 00:24:40,581
I never imagined myself
as a bride.

554
00:24:40,614 --> 00:24:42,583
Which is funny because

555
00:24:42,616 --> 00:24:45,086
we always hosted weddings
at the Quinn-Henry,

556
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:47,922
but I never imagined my own.

557
00:24:47,955 --> 00:24:49,056
Hmm.

558
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:54,161
How does it feel?

559
00:24:54,195 --> 00:24:56,097
Mm, I love the fabric.

560
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:57,765
I know.

561
00:24:57,798 --> 00:25:01,635
It's the finest, but...
how do you feel?

562
00:25:01,669 --> 00:25:04,538
Is this the right one?

563
00:25:08,109 --> 00:25:09,810
What do you think?

564
00:25:09,844 --> 00:25:11,178
It's perfect.

565
00:25:11,212 --> 00:25:13,647
-Yeah?
-Truly, truly stunning.

566
00:25:15,182 --> 00:25:16,283
We'll take it.

567
00:25:16,317 --> 00:25:17,885
<i>È bellissima.</i>

568
00:25:17,918 --> 00:25:19,920
Yes.

569
00:25:20,921 --> 00:25:23,190
-Hey! Yeah.
-Here they are.

570
00:25:23,224 --> 00:25:25,292
Oh, what'd you get?

571
00:25:25,326 --> 00:25:27,561
Do you know
that Mitchell's real name

572
00:25:27,595 --> 00:25:28,796
is Michelangelo?

573
00:25:28,829 --> 00:25:30,664
-Oh.
-And...

574
00:25:31,732 --> 00:25:34,135
Arturo. It's a much sexier name
than Arthur, right?

575
00:25:34,168 --> 00:25:35,269
Oh.

576
00:25:35,302 --> 00:25:37,905
Everything is sexier in Italy.

577
00:25:37,938 --> 00:25:40,041
Well, I know I am.

578
00:25:40,074 --> 00:25:41,709
-Right, Giuseppe?
-Of course.

579
00:25:44,845 --> 00:25:46,814
Oh, God.

580
00:25:46,847 --> 00:25:48,582
Mitchell.

581
00:25:48,616 --> 00:25:50,317
Because you sent him
that picture.

582
00:25:50,351 --> 00:25:52,620
-What? Let...
-What?

583
00:25:52,653 --> 00:25:54,655
"A true work of art.

584
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,791
And the dress
ain't bad, either."

585
00:25:56,824 --> 00:25:59,260
Oh, great line.

586
00:25:59,293 --> 00:26:01,729
This guy. Oh, God.

587
00:26:01,762 --> 00:26:02,830
Aw.

588
00:26:02,863 --> 00:26:04,665
-Hey, cheers.
-Hey, cheers is right.

589
00:26:04,698 --> 00:26:06,667
-Cheers. -Cheers.
-Here we go.

590
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,803
Rome is a great walking city,

591
00:26:08,836 --> 00:26:11,839
but it's an even better
sit-down-and-drink-wine city.

592
00:26:11,872 --> 00:26:12,706
So true.

593
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,375
I think you say that
about every city.

594
00:26:14,408 --> 00:26:17,011
What? No, e-every city
is not good for walking.

595
00:26:17,044 --> 00:26:18,212
Oh.

596
00:26:18,245 --> 00:26:19,713
The best walking city
is Venezia.

597
00:26:19,747 --> 00:26:23,150
Oh, I love Venice.

598
00:26:25,052 --> 00:26:27,922
Sh... Should we go?

599
00:26:28,722 --> 00:26:29,957
-To Venice?
-To...

600
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,692
-Of course.
-Yeah?

601
00:26:31,725 --> 00:26:33,661
Going to Venezia is never
the wrong decision.

602
00:26:33,694 --> 00:26:34,895
-Yeah.
-Oh.

603
00:26:34,929 --> 00:26:36,397
I-I have a friend
with a great hotel there.

604
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:38,399
Where do you not have
a friend with a hotel?

605
00:26:38,432 --> 00:26:40,301
Well, not many places.

606
00:26:40,334 --> 00:26:41,836
Well, I-I think we should

607
00:26:41,869 --> 00:26:44,071
just stay the course
and go to Tuscany.

608
00:26:44,105 --> 00:26:47,108
Venice is the most special city
in the world.

609
00:26:47,141 --> 00:26:48,709
The treasure of Italy.

610
00:26:48,742 --> 00:26:51,879
-"The treasure of Italy."
-Uh...

611
00:26:51,912 --> 00:26:55,850
Wasn't the guy in <i>The Alchemist</i>
searching for treasure?

612
00:26:55,883 --> 00:26:58,719
This is the universe
telling us we should go.

613
00:26:58,752 --> 00:27:02,089
Or is it a street artist
telling us to go?

614
00:27:02,123 --> 00:27:03,924
I mean, no offense, obviously.

615
00:27:03,958 --> 00:27:05,192
I say it's a sign.

616
00:27:05,226 --> 00:27:07,394
And it's my bachelorette,
remember?

617
00:27:07,428 --> 00:27:08,829
Mm-hmm.

618
00:27:08,863 --> 00:27:12,366
Judge, do you maybe want
to overrule this?

619
00:27:12,399 --> 00:27:15,069
Nonsense.
I'm the one wearing the sash,

620
00:27:15,102 --> 00:27:17,738
so what I say goes.

621
00:27:17,771 --> 00:27:21,041
New plan: <i>Andiamo a Venezia.</i>

622
00:27:21,075 --> 00:27:22,409
-Uh-huh.
-Ah.

623
00:27:22,443 --> 00:27:25,946
Is there room in this new plan
for sleeping?

624
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:29,016
Is 6:00 p.m. an appropriate
bachelorette bedtime?

625
00:27:29,049 --> 00:27:30,151
-Definitely.
-Really?

626
00:27:30,184 --> 00:27:32,286
-Very standard, actually.
-Okay.

627
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:34,288
Tomorrow, we leave
early in the morning.

628
00:27:34,321 --> 00:27:35,923
<i>Bellissima.</i>

629
00:27:37,057 --> 00:27:38,759
For the beautiful woman.

630
00:27:38,792 --> 00:27:40,928
Oh, wow.

631
00:27:40,961 --> 00:27:42,830
You really are sexier in Italy.

632
00:27:42,863 --> 00:27:44,698
It-it's like looking
in a mirror.

633
00:27:44,732 --> 00:27:46,000
Yeah.

634
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:48,903
Thank you.

635
00:28:01,248 --> 00:28:04,485
Thank you. <i>Grazie.</i> Thank you.

636
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:07,922
-Let's see. Where is Venice?
-Oh, I don't...

637
00:28:07,955 --> 00:28:09,990
-We're going...
-Oh, wow.

638
00:28:10,024 --> 00:28:11,725
Oh, hi.

639
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:13,227
<i>-Prima classe?</i>
<i>-Sì.</i>

640
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,361
-Yeah.
-Yeah, for sure.

641
00:28:14,395 --> 00:28:15,729
Yeah, first class.

642
00:28:15,763 --> 00:28:17,064
Where you going?

643
00:28:17,097 --> 00:28:18,732
-Venice.
-Ah, Venezia.

644
00:28:20,502 --> 00:28:22,203
We'll help you with the luggage.

645
00:28:22,236 --> 00:28:23,237
Allow us, please.

646
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:24,338
-We'll help you.
-Thank you.

647
00:28:24,371 --> 00:28:26,340
-Oh.
-Yeah.

648
00:28:26,373 --> 00:28:28,943
Venezia. Uh, plenty of time.

649
00:28:28,976 --> 00:28:30,144
-Yeah.
-Oh.

650
00:28:30,177 --> 00:28:31,378
Well, that's very kind.

651
00:28:31,412 --> 00:28:33,180
Thank you.
This is for both of you.

652
00:28:33,214 --> 00:28:34,949
Thank you so much.

653
00:28:37,284 --> 00:28:38,819
-Where's Venezia?
-See it?

654
00:28:38,852 --> 00:28:40,387
-You see Venice?
-I can't read any of that.

655
00:28:40,421 --> 00:28:41,855
There's Venezia.

656
00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:21,996
<i>Benvenute a Venezia.</i>

657
00:29:22,029 --> 00:29:23,197
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

658
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,265
<i>-Grazie.</i>
-Thank you.

659
00:29:24,298 --> 00:29:25,533
<i>-Prego.</i>
<i>-Grazie.</i>

660
00:29:25,567 --> 00:29:26,967
Boy.

661
00:29:27,001 --> 00:29:28,302
-Come on, everybody.
-Okay. Yeah.

662
00:29:28,335 --> 00:29:29,504
-All right.
-Good.

663
00:29:29,537 --> 00:29:31,138
Diane, can you hand me my purse?

664
00:29:31,171 --> 00:29:32,540
Oh, wait a minute.

665
00:29:32,574 --> 00:29:34,141
Um, no.

666
00:29:34,174 --> 00:29:36,277
Oh, my God, I don't see...
It's-it's not up here.

667
00:29:37,545 --> 00:29:39,313
Well, where is it?

668
00:29:40,447 --> 00:29:42,149
Um... Oh.

669
00:29:42,182 --> 00:29:43,284
Everything okay?

670
00:29:43,317 --> 00:29:44,552
I can't find my purse.

671
00:29:44,586 --> 00:29:46,053
I've got mine.

672
00:29:46,086 --> 00:29:48,422
But now is not
the time to gloat.

673
00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:49,957
Do you think it was stolen?

674
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,492
I didn't see anyone
come through.

675
00:29:51,526 --> 00:29:53,894
Yeah, Carol, are you sure
you put it up here?

676
00:29:53,927 --> 00:29:55,963
-Mm-hmm.
-I-I... I thought I did.

677
00:29:55,996 --> 00:29:57,364
Oh, God.

678
00:29:57,398 --> 00:29:59,166
Ah. Aha. Aha.

679
00:29:59,199 --> 00:30:00,334
Wait. Wait.

680
00:30:00,367 --> 00:30:02,570
-Oh.
-Oh.

681
00:30:02,604 --> 00:30:05,540
Thank you. Thank you.

682
00:30:05,573 --> 00:30:07,908
I was so nervous
that we'd been robbed.

683
00:30:07,941 --> 00:30:10,911
Uh, sir, where can we find
our checked bags?

684
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:13,047
What do you mean,
"checked bags"?

685
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,884
Oh, the ones that we gave
to the porters in Rome.

686
00:30:17,619 --> 00:30:20,421
I'm sorry,
but we don't have any porters.

687
00:30:22,624 --> 00:30:24,191
-Uh...
-Uh...

688
00:30:24,224 --> 00:30:27,828
Wh-When did you get rid
of the porters?

689
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:32,032
1976.

690
00:30:38,105 --> 00:30:39,641
No wonder the porters

691
00:30:39,674 --> 00:30:41,609
were so surprised
when I gave them a tip.

692
00:30:41,643 --> 00:30:44,044
Well, it's probably
not every day

693
00:30:44,078 --> 00:30:46,548
that someone gives them cash
to steal their luggage.

694
00:30:46,581 --> 00:30:48,382
Yeah, I just can't believe this.

695
00:30:48,415 --> 00:30:50,951
I can't lose that bag.

696
00:30:50,984 --> 00:30:52,620
Well, I know
it's annoying, honey,

697
00:30:52,654 --> 00:30:54,488
but it's not the end
of the world.

698
00:30:54,522 --> 00:30:56,190
You don't understand.

699
00:30:56,223 --> 00:30:58,492
It might be good to get you
some fresh clothes.

700
00:30:58,526 --> 00:31:00,494
Everything is replaceable.

701
00:31:00,528 --> 00:31:02,229
No, not everything is. No.

702
00:31:02,262 --> 00:31:06,066
Okay, Diane, I think you're
blowing this out of proportion.

703
00:31:08,135 --> 00:31:10,371
Harry's ashes are in the bag.

704
00:31:14,007 --> 00:31:16,210
-What?! Oh, God.
-Yeah.

705
00:31:16,243 --> 00:31:20,914
You brought Harry's ashes
to a bachelorette party?

706
00:31:20,948 --> 00:31:22,983
-Are you nuts?
-You're the one

707
00:31:23,016 --> 00:31:25,052
that said I shouldn't
leave him in the closet.

708
00:31:25,085 --> 00:31:26,387
So you brought him to Italy?

709
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,656
In a checked bag?

710
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:31,291
-Like a serial killer.
-Is that even legal?

711
00:31:31,325 --> 00:31:32,493
You're asking me?

712
00:31:32,527 --> 00:31:33,994
-Oh, <i>buongiorno.</i>
-Oh, yes.

713
00:31:34,027 --> 00:31:36,397
<i>-Buongiorno.</i>
-Oh, <i>buongiorno.</i>

714
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:38,365
-Yeah.
-Hi.

715
00:31:39,466 --> 00:31:43,370
So, we have made the report.

716
00:31:44,304 --> 00:31:47,141
Okay, and, uh...

717
00:31:47,174 --> 00:31:51,011
If, uh, anything turns up,
we will let you know.

718
00:31:51,044 --> 00:31:53,147
That's it? Because we've been
sitting here for two hours,

719
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,582
and that's all we're gonna get?

720
00:31:54,616 --> 00:31:58,285
No, that is not all.

721
00:31:58,318 --> 00:31:59,052
Uh-huh.

722
00:31:59,086 --> 00:32:01,656
I feel very bad for you.
Please.

723
00:32:01,689 --> 00:32:03,625
Oh, you feel bad for us?

724
00:32:03,658 --> 00:32:06,260
We don't need a man
to take pity on us.

725
00:32:06,293 --> 00:32:09,396
No, your lazy police work
is more than sufficient.

726
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,931
Um...

727
00:32:11,566 --> 00:32:12,734
I'm just curious.

728
00:32:12,767 --> 00:32:15,670
Hypothetically,
if you do find the bags,

729
00:32:15,703 --> 00:32:18,138
will you be going through them?

730
00:32:18,172 --> 00:32:20,508
I don't typically
make it a habit...

731
00:32:20,542 --> 00:32:21,709
Oh.

732
00:32:21,743 --> 00:32:23,110
...to go through
a lady's belongings.

733
00:32:23,143 --> 00:32:25,179
Oh, that's great. Okay, good.

734
00:32:25,212 --> 00:32:27,448
All right.
And thanks again. Thank you.

735
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:31,985
Wait, signora.

736
00:32:32,787 --> 00:32:34,321
Your dress.

737
00:32:34,354 --> 00:32:36,123
Oh. Oh, God. Shoot. Yes.

738
00:32:36,156 --> 00:32:37,991
That's my dress.
Thank you so much.

739
00:32:38,025 --> 00:32:39,460
Are you here for a wedding?

740
00:32:39,493 --> 00:32:41,729
No, it-it's a bachelorette trip,

741
00:32:41,763 --> 00:32:44,164
but my friends took me
dress shopping in Rome.

742
00:32:44,198 --> 00:32:46,333
-Such nice friends you have.
-Yes.

743
00:32:46,366 --> 00:32:47,535
Even the critical one.

744
00:32:49,403 --> 00:32:51,004
Yeah, well...

745
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:52,674
<i>Signora, per favore.</i>

746
00:32:52,707 --> 00:32:54,174
Before you go.

747
00:32:54,776 --> 00:32:56,376
Take this.

748
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:59,480
So we don't have to see
each other again.

749
00:32:59,514 --> 00:33:01,081
Well, thanks.

750
00:33:01,114 --> 00:33:05,352
This is tremendously helpful
at this point.

751
00:33:07,287 --> 00:33:10,625
Well, it's definitely not legal.

752
00:33:10,658 --> 00:33:13,293
-That's for sure.
-What were you thinking?

753
00:33:13,327 --> 00:33:15,229
I was just trying to do
a nice thing.

754
00:33:15,262 --> 00:33:18,031
I mean, he always wanted
to visit Italy.

755
00:33:18,065 --> 00:33:19,767
-Aw.
-It's a sweet idea.

756
00:33:19,801 --> 00:33:22,169
-Thanks.
-Also crazy.

757
00:33:22,202 --> 00:33:24,271
Yeah, I can see that now.

758
00:33:24,304 --> 00:33:27,107
On the bright side,
it's much easier walking

759
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,142
without dragging your luggage.

760
00:33:29,176 --> 00:33:31,311
Speak for yourself.

761
00:33:31,345 --> 00:33:32,312
This is like a...

762
00:33:32,346 --> 00:33:35,717
a full upper-body routine
carrying this thing.

763
00:33:36,618 --> 00:33:39,119
So, remember
that part in <i>The Alchemist</i>

764
00:33:39,152 --> 00:33:42,189
where the guy gets robbed
and loses everything?

765
00:33:42,222 --> 00:33:43,090
Yeah.

766
00:33:43,123 --> 00:33:45,125
I have no empathy for him
at this point.

767
00:33:45,158 --> 00:33:46,393
Yeah, neither do I.

768
00:33:46,426 --> 00:33:48,328
Well, he said he had
a choice to make.

769
00:33:48,362 --> 00:33:51,098
He could either see himself
as a victim of a thief...

770
00:33:51,131 --> 00:33:53,133
Or see himself as an adventurer

771
00:33:53,166 --> 00:33:54,602
in search of a treasure.

772
00:33:54,636 --> 00:33:56,470
Yeah, but we are victims
of a thief.

773
00:33:56,504 --> 00:33:59,373
But we are also adventurers.

774
00:34:50,223 --> 00:34:52,159
Ciao, Sofia.

775
00:34:52,192 --> 00:34:54,529
Ciao. Ciao.

776
00:34:54,562 --> 00:34:56,196
Welcome back.

777
00:34:56,229 --> 00:34:59,466
Ladies, let me assure you,
you're in good hands now.

778
00:34:59,499 --> 00:35:01,903
There is nothing my uncle
wouldn't do for this woman.

779
00:35:01,936 --> 00:35:04,137
-Oh, that's very sweet.
-Well, it's true.

780
00:35:04,171 --> 00:35:05,573
And you're in luck
because the wedding

781
00:35:05,607 --> 00:35:08,208
we were supposed to throw
this weekend canceled,

782
00:35:08,241 --> 00:35:10,545
so our best rooms are available.

783
00:35:10,578 --> 00:35:12,714
The wedding was canceled?

784
00:35:12,747 --> 00:35:14,882
Yeah. It was very dramatic.

785
00:35:14,916 --> 00:35:18,620
Screaming and crying,
and the dress on fire.

786
00:35:18,653 --> 00:35:19,921
-Oh.
-Yeah.

787
00:35:19,954 --> 00:35:21,355
But this is our boutique.

788
00:35:21,388 --> 00:35:23,691
I've let them know
to expect you.

789
00:35:23,725 --> 00:35:26,193
I've got the same thing in blue.

790
00:35:26,226 --> 00:35:27,729
Oh.

791
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:30,263
Here are your keys.

792
00:35:30,297 --> 00:35:31,699
I'm sure you're exhausted.

793
00:35:31,733 --> 00:35:33,333
Thank you.

794
00:35:33,367 --> 00:35:35,737
When you see your uncle,
please give him my very best.

795
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:37,337
Of course.

796
00:35:37,371 --> 00:35:38,906
And please, if there is
anything else you need,

797
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,440
-don't hesitate to ask.
-Thank you.

798
00:35:40,474 --> 00:35:41,743
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

799
00:35:41,776 --> 00:35:42,844
-Ciao.
-Ciao.

800
00:35:42,877 --> 00:35:44,244
Yeah.

801
00:35:44,277 --> 00:35:46,246
Nothing her uncle
wouldn't do for you, huh?

802
00:35:46,279 --> 00:35:48,482
Well, there was a time
15 years ago

803
00:35:48,516 --> 00:35:51,519
when there was nothing
I wouldn't have done for him...

804
00:35:51,552 --> 00:35:52,954
sexually.

805
00:35:52,987 --> 00:35:54,722
Well, thank you for clarifying.

806
00:35:54,756 --> 00:35:57,592
Well, if you must know,
he's why I got my knee replaced.

807
00:35:57,625 --> 00:35:59,661
-Oh, boy.
-Such commitment.

808
00:35:59,694 --> 00:36:01,361
Such sacrifice.

809
00:36:01,395 --> 00:36:03,531
Mm, she's a modern-day
Mother Teresa.

810
00:36:03,564 --> 00:36:05,700
That's the part
of Mother Teresa's story

811
00:36:05,733 --> 00:36:07,602
they don't tell you about.

812
00:36:07,635 --> 00:36:09,771
<i>She wasn't just</i>
<i>on her knees praying.</i>

813
00:36:09,804 --> 00:36:12,406
<i>Oh.</i>

814
00:36:17,979 --> 00:36:19,947
To help you forget
about your troubles.

815
00:36:19,981 --> 00:36:21,916
<i>Salute.</i>

816
00:36:21,949 --> 00:36:24,519
It won't hurt.

817
00:36:24,552 --> 00:36:26,554
Forgive me,
I-I couldn't help but overhear.

818
00:36:26,587 --> 00:36:30,525
What sort of troubles
have you got yourself into?

819
00:36:30,558 --> 00:36:32,426
Oh.

820
00:36:32,459 --> 00:36:35,530
A little snafu
at the train station.

821
00:36:35,563 --> 00:36:38,365
My friends and I
had our luggage stolen.

822
00:36:39,332 --> 00:36:42,003
Well, that sounds like
more than a little snafu.

823
00:36:42,036 --> 00:36:43,604
All your luggage?

824
00:36:43,638 --> 00:36:44,906
Wallets? Passport?

825
00:36:44,939 --> 00:36:46,306
Oh, please.

826
00:36:46,339 --> 00:36:49,376
What kind of fool
do you take me for?

827
00:36:54,849 --> 00:36:56,283
Fantastic.

828
00:36:56,316 --> 00:36:58,886
No one could get this off me.
No one.

829
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,287
Oh.

830
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,957
It would require
very nimble fingers,

831
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:05,225
I imagine.

832
00:37:07,028 --> 00:37:09,764
Well, since we're playing
"you show me yours,

833
00:37:09,797 --> 00:37:11,866
I'll show you mine."

834
00:37:14,569 --> 00:37:17,605
Be still my heart.

835
00:37:22,342 --> 00:37:25,646
No, I'm just saying you need
to keep stress to a minimum.

836
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,014
I'm at a driving range.

837
00:37:27,048 --> 00:37:30,450
That's just a bit more strenuous
than taking a nap.

838
00:37:30,484 --> 00:37:32,419
Sweetheart, listen, are you sure

839
00:37:32,452 --> 00:37:34,622
that I shouldn't come over
and meet up with you?

840
00:37:34,655 --> 00:37:36,624
We discussed this, Bruce.

841
00:37:36,657 --> 00:37:38,593
It's-it's not safe.

842
00:37:38,626 --> 00:37:40,962
Yeah, I know. I was just
thinking that, you know...

843
00:37:40,995 --> 00:37:43,631
So, tomorrow,
we're going to La Toscana.

844
00:37:43,664 --> 00:37:44,932
La Toscana?

845
00:37:44,966 --> 00:37:47,400
-That's how you say Tuscany.
-Oh, oh.

846
00:37:47,434 --> 00:37:49,369
I thought you were talking
about the restaurant

847
00:37:49,402 --> 00:37:50,872
on San Vicente.

848
00:37:50,905 --> 00:37:54,909
Why would I be talking about
a restaurant on San Vicente

849
00:37:54,942 --> 00:37:56,577
when I'm in Italy?

850
00:37:56,611 --> 00:37:58,513
-Eataly?
-What?

851
00:37:58,546 --> 00:37:59,881
Eataly.

852
00:37:59,914 --> 00:38:01,849
The restaurant in Century City.

853
00:38:01,883 --> 00:38:03,416
I'm just making restaurant jokes

854
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:05,920
because, uh, I'm on
such a strict diet, honey.

855
00:38:05,953 --> 00:38:07,789
Okay. Okay, I get it now.

856
00:38:07,822 --> 00:38:10,457
Yeah, well, if I got to explain
the jokes, Carol,

857
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:12,593
it's just not as funny.

858
00:38:12,627 --> 00:38:16,063
How about we just cool it with
the jokes about restaurants?

859
00:38:16,097 --> 00:38:19,033
You don't hear me making jokes
about angioplasty.

860
00:38:19,066 --> 00:38:21,301
Oh, gosh, I wish you would.

861
00:38:21,903 --> 00:38:24,005
-A bachelorette trip?
-Yes.

862
00:38:24,038 --> 00:38:26,040
I don't think
I know anyone who's done

863
00:38:26,073 --> 00:38:28,408
anything like that for 20 years.

864
00:38:28,441 --> 00:38:31,411
And why not, right?

865
00:38:31,444 --> 00:38:35,415
Honestly, this is
how I want to live my life.

866
00:38:35,448 --> 00:38:37,051
On a bachelorette trip?

867
00:38:37,084 --> 00:38:38,686
Of course.

868
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:42,890
And guided by
the daily practice of "why not?"

869
00:38:42,924 --> 00:38:44,659
For a second,
I thought you said,

870
00:38:44,692 --> 00:38:46,894
"Guided by
the daily practice of wine,"

871
00:38:46,928 --> 00:38:48,696
and I thought, "Okay."

872
00:38:48,729 --> 00:38:50,698
Well, it's not
a bad combination.

873
00:38:50,731 --> 00:38:53,067
"Wine and 'Why Not?'"

874
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,837
That's gonna be
the title of my autobiography.

875
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:59,740
Well, I promise that
I shall buy a first edition.

876
00:38:59,774 --> 00:39:01,843
You're on.

877
00:39:01,876 --> 00:39:03,711
Oh, my God. Look at her.

878
00:39:03,744 --> 00:39:06,013
We can't leave her alone
for a second.

879
00:39:06,047 --> 00:39:08,149
Yeah, they're like
moths to a flame.

880
00:39:08,182 --> 00:39:09,717
Oh. Ciao, guys.

881
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:11,853
Oh, hi.

882
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,155
<i>-Buonasera.</i>
-Hey. -Hi.

883
00:39:14,188 --> 00:39:15,957
Whoo!

884
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:17,158
This is Ousmane.

885
00:39:17,191 --> 00:39:18,626
-Uh-huh.
-Ciao.

886
00:39:18,659 --> 00:39:20,027
It's really very nice
to meet you.

887
00:39:20,061 --> 00:39:23,130
Which one of you
is the bride-to-be?

888
00:39:23,164 --> 00:39:25,465
-Oh, definitely not me.
-Oh, no.

889
00:39:25,498 --> 00:39:26,801
She'll be down in just a minute.

890
00:39:26,834 --> 00:39:29,469
It must be very exciting
for all of you.

891
00:39:29,503 --> 00:39:31,906
And I'm delighted that
you'll be joining us tonight.

892
00:39:31,939 --> 00:39:33,174
-Tonight?
-Uh, yes.

893
00:39:33,207 --> 00:39:35,176
I-I made dinner plans
for us tonight.

894
00:39:35,209 --> 00:39:36,777
-Oh.
-Great.

895
00:39:36,811 --> 00:39:39,146
It's going to be...
Wh-What did you call it?

896
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,682
"An authentic
Italian experience"?

897
00:39:41,716 --> 00:39:43,985
Wait a minute. Are we going
to the Olive Garden?

898
00:39:44,018 --> 00:39:45,418
Oh, I'm sorry.

899
00:39:45,452 --> 00:39:47,021
I promise you it'll be worth it.

900
00:39:47,054 --> 00:39:49,090
It's great food, great people.

901
00:39:49,123 --> 00:39:53,060
-And there's no problem if
four random women show up? -Mm.

902
00:39:53,094 --> 00:39:54,962
This is Italy.

903
00:39:54,996 --> 00:39:58,933
There's always room
for random beautiful women.

904
00:39:58,966 --> 00:40:00,868
-Oh.
-He's good.

905
00:41:16,577 --> 00:41:19,547
Look at this!

906
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,782
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah.

907
00:41:21,816 --> 00:41:23,651
You pulled together
this bachelorette dinner

908
00:41:23,684 --> 00:41:25,252
in-in-in record time.

909
00:41:25,286 --> 00:41:27,254
It was easier than you think.

910
00:41:27,288 --> 00:41:30,257
And we even got you a band.

911
00:41:30,291 --> 00:41:31,659
Look!

912
00:41:31,692 --> 00:41:33,794
Hope you like Italian music.

913
00:41:37,131 --> 00:41:38,733
Hey.

914
00:41:38,766 --> 00:41:41,202
So we decided to go
into the jewelry store,

915
00:41:41,235 --> 00:41:44,205
and before we knew it,
we were engaged.

916
00:41:44,238 --> 00:41:47,008
Well, I think that's
incredibly romantic.

917
00:41:47,041 --> 00:41:48,275
Well, thank you.

918
00:41:48,309 --> 00:41:50,144
-Are you married?
-No.

919
00:41:50,177 --> 00:41:53,247
I-I've traveled that road.

920
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,849
Not a pleasant journey?

921
00:41:54,882 --> 00:41:57,284
Well, it was a bit
of a carjacking, really.

922
00:41:57,318 --> 00:41:59,587
-Hmm.
-Oh.

923
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,555
Well, um, it wasn't all bad.

924
00:42:01,589 --> 00:42:04,025
Uh, are you all married?

925
00:42:04,058 --> 00:42:05,593
Married.

926
00:42:05,626 --> 00:42:07,194
Not married but not single.

927
00:42:07,228 --> 00:42:09,030
-Ah. Dating.
-Yeah.

928
00:42:09,063 --> 00:42:10,798
Serious boyfriend.

929
00:42:10,831 --> 00:42:11,732
Yeah, I mean...

930
00:42:11,766 --> 00:42:13,300
I don't know,
"boyfriend and girlfriend"

931
00:42:13,334 --> 00:42:14,902
just sounds so silly, you know?

932
00:42:14,935 --> 00:42:16,303
Like we're in high school
or something.

933
00:42:16,337 --> 00:42:18,305
I'm too old to be
somebody's girlfriend.

934
00:42:18,339 --> 00:42:19,907
Are you kidding?

935
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:22,610
Oh, being a girlfriend is
the greatest thing in the world.

936
00:42:22,643 --> 00:42:24,712
-That's not true.
-Oh, it is.

937
00:42:24,745 --> 00:42:27,181
Being a girlfriend is sexy.

938
00:42:27,214 --> 00:42:28,582
It's exciting.

939
00:42:28,616 --> 00:42:29,750
You know, it means
you love somebody

940
00:42:29,784 --> 00:42:31,085
and you're committed to them,

941
00:42:31,118 --> 00:42:33,087
but you still have
your own life.

942
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:36,924
You haven't given yourself up
to society's conventions.

943
00:42:36,957 --> 00:42:37,992
It's all about choice.

944
00:42:38,025 --> 00:42:40,294
You choose to be there,

945
00:42:40,327 --> 00:42:43,230
but you can leave
any time you damn well please.

946
00:42:43,264 --> 00:42:44,365
Perfect.

947
00:42:44,398 --> 00:42:46,033
And you're the bride-to-be?

948
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:50,905
And what about you?

949
00:42:51,705 --> 00:42:53,174
Oh, she's the single one.

950
00:42:53,207 --> 00:42:55,176
Oh, well, every group needs one.

951
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:58,913
And I'm the one who has to run
to the ladies' room,

952
00:42:58,946 --> 00:43:00,214
if you'll excuse me.

953
00:43:00,247 --> 00:43:02,850
Ousmane,
what do you do in Italy?

954
00:43:02,883 --> 00:43:04,018
Philosophy.

955
00:43:04,051 --> 00:43:07,188
No, I-I was
a professor of philosophy.

956
00:43:07,221 --> 00:43:08,956
Happily now retired.

957
00:43:08,989 --> 00:43:12,126
Which is why I have
so much time to spend here.

958
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:14,628
-Ciao.
-Ciao, chef.

959
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:20,835
<i>...Sharon, Diane e Vivian.</i>

960
00:43:20,868 --> 00:43:23,104
You're so kind to include us.

961
00:43:24,071 --> 00:43:25,406
It is my sincerest joy.

962
00:43:25,439 --> 00:43:31,145
So, let us proceed
with <i>un po' di prosecco.</i>

963
00:43:31,178 --> 00:43:33,280
It, uh, prepares the palate.

964
00:43:33,314 --> 00:43:35,182
Oh, thank you.

965
00:43:35,216 --> 00:43:36,784
<i>-Prego.</i>
-Yeah.

966
00:43:36,817 --> 00:43:38,252
What brings you to Venice?

967
00:43:38,285 --> 00:43:42,256
Oh, uh, a series of, well,
unanticipated events, so...

968
00:43:42,289 --> 00:43:45,192
-Ah. The spice of life.
-Oh. Thanks.

969
00:43:45,226 --> 00:43:47,194
I got a little lost.

970
00:43:47,228 --> 00:43:48,929
Wow.

971
00:43:48,963 --> 00:43:50,764
That's quite a situation
in the bosom area.

972
00:43:50,798 --> 00:43:52,266
-Oh! <i>Scusi.</i>
-Yeah.

973
00:43:52,299 --> 00:43:55,336
-Oh. I overdid it, didn't I?
-Oh, no, that's okay.

974
00:43:55,369 --> 00:43:56,904
No, absolutely not.

975
00:44:01,041 --> 00:44:02,209
Wait.

976
00:44:03,177 --> 00:44:05,012
Carolina.

977
00:44:05,045 --> 00:44:06,413
Gianni.

978
00:44:06,447 --> 00:44:08,749
-Gianni, is that you?
<i>-Sì.</i>

979
00:44:08,782 --> 00:44:11,018
<i>Sì, si.</i>

980
00:44:11,051 --> 00:44:12,319
This is crazy.

981
00:44:12,353 --> 00:44:14,221
What are you doing here?

982
00:44:14,255 --> 00:44:15,823
Me? Well, I live here.

983
00:44:15,856 --> 00:44:17,458
This is my cooking school.

984
00:44:17,491 --> 00:44:20,694
Oh. Wait, wait.
You mean Gi-Gianni?

985
00:44:20,728 --> 00:44:22,897
Gi-Gianni, Gianni?

986
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:24,131
It's the Gianni.

987
00:44:24,165 --> 00:44:25,699
Not fat or bald.

988
00:44:25,733 --> 00:44:27,301
-This is crazy. -I've heard
about your meatballs.

989
00:44:27,334 --> 00:44:28,836
I-I can't believe.

990
00:44:28,869 --> 00:44:30,838
I mean, look at you, huh?

991
00:44:30,871 --> 00:44:31,972
Oh.

992
00:44:32,006 --> 00:44:34,008
Yeah, I mean,
this is a new dress,

993
00:44:34,041 --> 00:44:36,043
and it's a little... probably
a little much for tonight,

994
00:44:36,076 --> 00:44:38,112
but I just wanted
to have a little fun.

995
00:44:38,145 --> 00:44:39,780
You look beautiful.

996
00:44:39,813 --> 00:44:41,782
-Thank you.
-My goodness.

997
00:44:41,815 --> 00:44:44,218
Thank you. This is incredible.

998
00:44:44,251 --> 00:44:45,886
-Wow.
-Wow.

999
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,488
Yes. Oh, <i>grazie.</i>

1000
00:44:47,522 --> 00:44:49,857
Uh, and here to start,
an amuse-bouche.

1001
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:51,325
-Oh.
-I think somebody's

1002
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:53,360
bouche is already quite amused.

1003
00:44:53,394 --> 00:44:55,696
Enjoy, please. I need to, uh...

1004
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:57,898
My head is spinning.

1005
00:44:57,932 --> 00:45:00,201
There's so many things
I want to put in your mouth.

1006
00:45:00,234 --> 00:45:01,835
-I can't wait.
-Oh.

1007
00:45:01,869 --> 00:45:05,005
And I mustn't overheat
your cacciucco. Uh, e-excuse me.

1008
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:06,907
May be a little late for that.

1009
00:45:06,941 --> 00:45:08,510
Even my cacciucco is overheated.

1010
00:45:08,543 --> 00:45:10,411
So is mine.

1011
00:45:12,246 --> 00:45:14,348
-Oh, that was the best meal.
-So delicious.

1012
00:45:14,381 --> 00:45:15,482
No, no. Uh...

1013
00:45:15,517 --> 00:45:17,151
I can't even believe it.

1014
00:45:17,184 --> 00:45:18,752
What are the chances?

1015
00:45:18,786 --> 00:45:21,422
If I were writing a book,
I'd have you sleep with him

1016
00:45:21,455 --> 00:45:23,357
just to get the recipe
for this sauce.

1017
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:24,959
Ooh.

1018
00:45:24,992 --> 00:45:26,493
Libations.

1019
00:45:26,528 --> 00:45:27,828
-Oh.
-Oh, my God.

1020
00:45:27,861 --> 00:45:29,096
I think I've had enough.

1021
00:45:29,129 --> 00:45:32,833
Oh, come on.
This is your bachelorette,

1022
00:45:32,866 --> 00:45:36,737
and things are about to get
even more fun.

1023
00:45:38,439 --> 00:45:40,140
Ooh!

1024
00:45:40,174 --> 00:45:41,875
Oh.

1025
00:45:41,909 --> 00:45:44,278
-Goodness.
-Oh, fun.

1026
00:45:44,311 --> 00:45:45,846
Right?

1027
00:45:45,879 --> 00:45:47,549
Very Christian Grey.

1028
00:45:53,254 --> 00:45:54,755
Hey.

1029
00:46:07,368 --> 00:46:09,169
Can you believe this?

1030
00:46:10,137 --> 00:46:13,340
I told you
we should come to Italy.

1031
00:46:58,285 --> 00:47:00,087
Oh, my God.

1032
00:47:06,093 --> 00:47:07,328
You go!

1033
00:47:19,139 --> 00:47:21,008
Whoo!

1034
00:47:33,053 --> 00:47:35,657
Oh, well, that was a first.

1035
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:38,926
I was thinking of taking
a little stroll

1036
00:47:38,959 --> 00:47:42,029
down by the docks,
if you're interested.

1037
00:47:42,062 --> 00:47:44,498
It-it might be getting
very near my bedtime.

1038
00:47:46,233 --> 00:47:49,169
You seem a little too old
to have a bedtime.

1039
00:47:49,203 --> 00:47:51,972
Well, let's just agree
that that was a compliment.

1040
00:47:52,005 --> 00:47:55,042
That would be helpful.
Thank you.

1041
00:47:55,075 --> 00:47:56,877
Shall we?

1042
00:47:58,513 --> 00:47:59,581
And there goes Sharon.

1043
00:47:59,614 --> 00:48:01,415
Oh...

1044
00:48:01,448 --> 00:48:03,016
<i>Scusi, signora.</i>
Chef Gianni says,

1045
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:06,186
if you would like,
you should see his <i>cucina.</i>

1046
00:48:06,987 --> 00:48:09,056
I'm sorry, see his <i>cucina?</i>

1047
00:48:09,089 --> 00:48:11,125
Yeah. It means kitchen.

1048
00:48:11,158 --> 00:48:12,025
Oh.

1049
00:48:12,059 --> 00:48:14,294
I bet it's big, isn't it?

1050
00:48:14,328 --> 00:48:16,330
-I mean, it's a cooking school.
-Uh-huh.

1051
00:48:16,363 --> 00:48:20,033
<i>Bene.</i> Uh, please, he says
you come whenever you'd like.

1052
00:48:20,067 --> 00:48:22,136
Oh, that's so sweet.

1053
00:48:22,169 --> 00:48:25,272
You tell Chef Gianni
she'd be excited to come.

1054
00:48:25,305 --> 00:48:26,440
<i>Bene.</i>

1055
00:48:26,473 --> 00:48:27,575
Preferably more than once.

1056
00:48:27,609 --> 00:48:29,176
Oh, good God.

1057
00:48:29,209 --> 00:48:32,079
You know what,
are you...

1058
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:36,216
I do want to see his <i>cucina.</i>

1059
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:38,352
Well, just go.

1060
00:48:38,385 --> 00:48:41,221
-Yes. -But don't do anything
I would do.

1061
00:48:41,255 --> 00:48:43,558
I think that's actually
really good advice.

1062
00:48:43,591 --> 00:48:45,593
It's just a kitchen.

1063
00:48:45,627 --> 00:48:47,027
Oh.

1064
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:49,329
-Whoa.
-Yeah, sure.

1065
00:48:51,365 --> 00:48:53,033
And then there were two.

1066
00:48:53,066 --> 00:48:54,602
-Yeah.
-Ooh.

1067
00:48:54,636 --> 00:48:56,170
Agatha Christie.

1068
00:48:56,203 --> 00:48:57,705
Oh. Indeed.

1069
00:49:01,643 --> 00:49:04,579
-Oh, whoa.
-Oh, boy.

1070
00:49:04,612 --> 00:49:06,581
What a day we've had, huh?

1071
00:49:06,614 --> 00:49:09,016
-I mean, this...
-I know.

1072
00:49:09,049 --> 00:49:10,585
The lost luggage.

1073
00:49:10,618 --> 00:49:14,087
Who loses a person's ashes?

1074
00:49:15,155 --> 00:49:16,591
I don't know,
I guess some skeletons

1075
00:49:16,624 --> 00:49:18,726
are best left
in the closet, right?

1076
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,695
God, I don't know.

1077
00:49:20,728 --> 00:49:22,429
-Yeah.
-And you?

1078
00:49:22,463 --> 00:49:23,698
Huh?

1079
00:49:23,731 --> 00:49:26,200
Married. "Marriaged."

1080
00:49:26,233 --> 00:49:28,670
Yeah.

1081
00:49:28,703 --> 00:49:30,404
My...

1082
00:49:30,437 --> 00:49:36,210
My solo act is finally
coming to a close.

1083
00:49:36,243 --> 00:49:38,078
It's crazy.

1084
00:49:38,111 --> 00:49:40,447
-Especially for me.
-Yeah.

1085
00:49:40,481 --> 00:49:42,216
I mean, I know it is.

1086
00:49:42,249 --> 00:49:44,586
No, come on. Who am I to judge?

1087
00:49:44,619 --> 00:49:47,087
Uh, but, yeah,
I thought so at first.

1088
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:49,624
But, you know,
I think what you're doing

1089
00:49:49,657 --> 00:49:51,726
is freaking incredible.

1090
00:49:51,759 --> 00:49:54,461
And I'm genuinely excited
for you.

1091
00:49:54,495 --> 00:49:56,163
You're drunk.

1092
00:49:56,196 --> 00:49:58,800
No. No, I'm being serious.

1093
00:49:58,833 --> 00:50:01,536
Well, I'm... Okay,
so maybe a little. I mean...

1094
00:50:01,569 --> 00:50:03,036
But I'm still serious.

1095
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:04,271
I don't know how you do it.

1096
00:50:04,304 --> 00:50:07,107
You tore up
the instruction manual,

1097
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:09,176
and you just
never even looked back.

1098
00:50:09,209 --> 00:50:11,378
I mean, you're
the bravest person I know.

1099
00:50:11,411 --> 00:50:15,650
And I'm so happy
that you're my friend.

1100
00:50:15,683 --> 00:50:18,051
Oh, God.
You're definitely drunk.

1101
00:50:18,085 --> 00:50:20,555
You can't even take
a compliment, can you?

1102
00:50:20,588 --> 00:50:21,789
No.

1103
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:23,457
But it's true.

1104
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:26,460
I'd never have the guts
to do what you're doing.

1105
00:50:26,493 --> 00:50:27,695
Well, I appreciate it.

1106
00:50:30,698 --> 00:50:32,767
-I do. I appreciate it.
-You do.

1107
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,368
Thank you.

1108
00:50:34,401 --> 00:50:36,169
Hey, we're having
a fun trip, aren't we?

1109
00:50:36,203 --> 00:50:39,406
Oh. If you hadn't
gotten engaged,

1110
00:50:39,439 --> 00:50:43,243
I'm not sure I would have
ever experienced Italy.

1111
00:50:43,845 --> 00:50:45,212
What do you think?

1112
00:50:45,245 --> 00:50:47,749
Oh. Oh, I can't believe...

1113
00:50:47,782 --> 00:50:49,751
I can't believe
what I almost missed.

1114
00:50:50,718 --> 00:50:55,690
But the only question is:
How will we mess this all up?

1115
00:50:57,725 --> 00:51:00,360
I don't know,
but if we mess it up

1116
00:51:00,394 --> 00:51:02,262
the way we've messed up
the trip so far,

1117
00:51:02,296 --> 00:51:04,364
I can't wait to find out.

1118
00:51:04,398 --> 00:51:06,233
Yeah, but first...

1119
00:51:06,266 --> 00:51:08,268
bedtime.

1120
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:10,437
Yeah. Yeah.

1121
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:12,574
-I do need my beauty sleep.
-Yeah.

1122
00:51:12,607 --> 00:51:16,176
You know, this doesn't
just happen on its own.

1123
00:51:16,209 --> 00:51:19,581
I imagine it's the work
of many skilled artisans.

1124
00:51:19,614 --> 00:51:21,849
Yeah,
they're practically unionized.

1125
00:51:21,883 --> 00:51:24,284
Okay.

1126
00:51:30,324 --> 00:51:33,427
"Of all the gin joints
in all the towns

1127
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:36,698
in all the world,
she walks into mine."

1128
00:51:37,632 --> 00:51:39,433
<i>Casablanca.</i>

1129
00:51:39,466 --> 00:51:41,335
Remember?

1130
00:51:41,368 --> 00:51:42,704
I remember.

1131
00:51:43,938 --> 00:51:47,508
You know, my first time
was with you.

1132
00:51:47,542 --> 00:51:50,511
What? It was?

1133
00:51:51,411 --> 00:51:53,548
The... No, I...
I mean the movie.

1134
00:51:53,581 --> 00:51:56,450
-Seeing the movie.
-Oh.

1135
00:51:56,483 --> 00:51:58,352
Oh.

1136
00:51:58,385 --> 00:52:00,822
I'm not sure we ever
actually made it to the end.

1137
00:52:00,855 --> 00:52:02,824
My favorite part. I mean...

1138
00:52:02,857 --> 00:52:05,359
Not-not the end.
The not making it to...

1139
00:52:05,392 --> 00:52:07,361
I-I knew what you meant
that time.

1140
00:52:08,462 --> 00:52:12,232
Okay, you're going to have
to explain something to me.

1141
00:52:12,265 --> 00:52:14,836
-Mm-hmm.
-You live in a place

1142
00:52:14,869 --> 00:52:16,804
where there are no roads,

1143
00:52:16,838 --> 00:52:22,275
but you have a van
in your kitchen?

1144
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:24,646
Uh, <i>sì.</i>

1145
00:52:24,679 --> 00:52:26,714
Makes no sense.

1146
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:31,451
That's what makes it so special.

1147
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:35,857
I thought it would make me
want to go somewhere.

1148
00:52:35,890 --> 00:52:38,893
But no,
only made me happy to stay.

1149
00:52:40,695 --> 00:52:43,363
-I get it.
-Mm.

1150
00:52:46,567 --> 00:52:51,405
This place is
absolutely beautiful.

1151
00:52:51,438 --> 00:52:53,240
<i>Grazie.</i>

1152
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:03,584
You must, too,
still be a chef, <i>sì?</i>

1153
00:53:04,519 --> 00:53:06,486
<i>-Sì.</i>
-Ah.

1154
00:53:06,521 --> 00:53:08,589
I can tell.

1155
00:53:09,456 --> 00:53:11,258
-Oh, yeah? You can?
-Mm-hmm.

1156
00:53:11,291 --> 00:53:13,861
<i>Assolutamente, sì.</i> Your aura.

1157
00:53:13,895 --> 00:53:16,664
In the <i>cucina,</i>
everything is now.

1158
00:53:16,698 --> 00:53:17,999
Present time.

1159
00:53:18,032 --> 00:53:20,367
I see you understand this.

1160
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:24,806
Not worrying about, uh,
yesterday,

1161
00:53:24,839 --> 00:53:26,774
tomorrow.

1162
00:53:26,808 --> 00:53:28,543
Grappa.

1163
00:53:31,012 --> 00:53:33,748
It's about living well
for today.

1164
00:53:47,327 --> 00:53:50,297
<i>-Salute.</i>
<i>-Salute.</i>

1165
00:53:55,903 --> 00:53:58,740
-Mmm.
<i>-A tavola non si invecchia.</i>

1166
00:53:58,773 --> 00:54:01,374
It means, "At the table, one..."

1167
00:54:01,408 --> 00:54:03,778
"One does not grow old."

1168
00:54:04,746 --> 00:54:06,346
You know this saying?

1169
00:54:06,379 --> 00:54:09,584
I actually had that
on the wall of my restaurant.

1170
00:54:09,617 --> 00:54:11,652
Oh. Really?

1171
00:54:12,452 --> 00:54:14,488
It's a sign.

1172
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:22,730
No one smiles like you.

1173
00:54:23,898 --> 00:54:26,299
I always remembered this.

1174
00:54:33,674 --> 00:54:36,376
Uh, <i>per favore,</i> will you, uh...

1175
00:54:36,409 --> 00:54:38,378
-Oh, <i>s... sì, si.</i>
-...take a picture?

1176
00:54:38,411 --> 00:54:41,281
-Mm-hmm.
<i>-Prego.</i>

1177
00:54:50,992 --> 00:54:53,326
<i>Quanto sei bella.</i>

1178
00:54:54,662 --> 00:54:57,330
You don't look so bad
yourself, Gianni.

1179
00:55:00,535 --> 00:55:03,470
So, how long you are
in Venezia, Carolina?

1180
00:55:05,139 --> 00:55:07,608
Sadly, we are leaving tomorrow.

1181
00:55:07,642 --> 00:55:09,309
Ah.

1182
00:55:10,443 --> 00:55:15,750
So, uh, we better take
advantage of tonight, really.

1183
00:55:36,504 --> 00:55:38,573
Let me know when you get tired.

1184
00:55:38,606 --> 00:55:41,474
Oh, I can do this all night.

1185
00:55:41,509 --> 00:55:44,344
Mamma mia.

1186
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:04,364
Don't move.

1187
00:56:05,533 --> 00:56:07,367
What are you doing?

1188
00:56:08,669 --> 00:56:10,004
That would be me.

1189
00:56:10,037 --> 00:56:12,740
Ah, Signora Bridesmaid.

1190
00:56:12,773 --> 00:56:14,474
Oh, shit.

1191
00:56:14,508 --> 00:56:16,844
You're in the middle
of the canal.

1192
00:56:16,878 --> 00:56:18,445
Wow.

1193
00:56:18,478 --> 00:56:19,747
Look at us.

1194
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:23,050
For the record,
that thing I said earlier

1195
00:56:23,084 --> 00:56:25,987
about your being lazy,

1196
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:27,722
I'd like to take it back.

1197
00:56:27,755 --> 00:56:29,657
Hmm.

1198
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:32,093
You called him lazy?
Wh-Why would you do that?

1199
00:56:32,126 --> 00:56:34,161
Believe it or not,
I didn't anticipate

1200
00:56:34,195 --> 00:56:36,731
running into him again.

1201
00:56:38,699 --> 00:56:42,603
Um, perhaps we could
trouble you for a tow.

1202
00:56:43,537 --> 00:56:47,074
Perhaps the signora
can swim you back to shore.

1203
00:56:49,076 --> 00:56:52,046
See how lazy he is?

1204
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:53,881
I heard you.

1205
00:57:14,268 --> 00:57:16,570
Good night?

1206
00:57:17,838 --> 00:57:19,674
Don't ask.

1207
00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:24,779
You?

1208
00:57:24,812 --> 00:57:27,081
Same.

1209
00:57:30,518 --> 00:57:33,054
We made pasta.

1210
00:57:33,087 --> 00:57:35,222
In a van.

1211
00:57:35,256 --> 00:57:40,027
I made pasta in a boat.

1212
00:57:48,002 --> 00:57:49,236
Hey.

1213
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:52,039
Last night was really fun,
wasn't it?

1214
00:57:52,073 --> 00:57:54,608
I need a minute.

1215
00:57:54,642 --> 00:57:56,243
Well, there you go.

1216
00:57:56,277 --> 00:57:57,945
Look who's awake.

1217
00:57:57,979 --> 00:57:59,814
Good morning.

1218
00:58:00,748 --> 00:58:01,849
What happened?

1219
00:58:01,882 --> 00:58:03,117
Oh, boy.

1220
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:05,119
Sharon's probably
even worse off.

1221
00:58:05,152 --> 00:58:07,588
<i>-Buongiorno.</i>
-Oh.

1222
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:11,692
Ooh. Biscotti.

1223
00:58:11,726 --> 00:58:13,861
Oh, well, look who's
very chipper this morning.

1224
00:58:13,894 --> 00:58:15,196
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1225
00:58:15,229 --> 00:58:20,067
Well, my Halo says
my sleep score was 96.

1226
00:58:20,101 --> 00:58:21,569
Ah.

1227
00:58:21,602 --> 00:58:24,538
Everyone needs
to stop screaming.

1228
00:58:25,272 --> 00:58:26,707
-Aw.
-Oh.

1229
00:58:26,741 --> 00:58:28,676
Hey, what about
if we shift our plans

1230
00:58:28,709 --> 00:58:31,012
and-and stayed
another night here?

1231
00:58:31,045 --> 00:58:32,146
-No.
-No.

1232
00:58:32,179 --> 00:58:34,115
Whoa. All right. Wow.

1233
00:58:34,148 --> 00:58:36,684
Time to get to Tuscany, huh?

1234
00:58:36,717 --> 00:58:39,153
So we... Do we just get back
on the train?

1235
00:58:39,186 --> 00:58:41,155
Oh, forget the train.

1236
00:58:41,188 --> 00:58:43,557
We got robbed on the train.

1237
00:58:43,591 --> 00:58:45,893
Technically, we got robbed
in the train station.

1238
00:58:45,926 --> 00:58:48,162
Technically,
we gave our things away

1239
00:58:48,195 --> 00:58:50,631
in the train station.

1240
00:58:50,664 --> 00:58:53,000
<i>-Caffè, signore?</i>
-Oh, yes. -Me.

1241
00:58:53,034 --> 00:58:54,702
Thank you.

1242
00:59:55,129 --> 00:59:57,131
Gianni texted me.

1243
00:59:57,164 --> 00:59:58,732
-Oh, God.
-That bastard.

1244
00:59:58,766 --> 01:00:00,000
Thought we hit something.

1245
01:00:00,034 --> 01:00:01,902
No, no, no, no,
you don't understand.

1246
01:00:01,936 --> 01:00:04,705
He sent a bunch of photos of us
from last night.

1247
01:00:04,738 --> 01:00:06,140
So?

1248
01:00:06,173 --> 01:00:09,210
Are we talking, like,
the nudie type pictures or...

1249
01:00:09,243 --> 01:00:11,312
-Are you nuts? No.
-Well...

1250
01:00:11,345 --> 01:00:13,414
But Bruce is gonna see these.

1251
01:00:13,447 --> 01:00:16,283
It goes to my iPad.

1252
01:00:16,317 --> 01:00:18,986
Oh, God!

1253
01:00:19,019 --> 01:00:20,254
-No.
-What?

1254
01:00:20,287 --> 01:00:22,990
He... His crazy broken English.

1255
01:00:23,023 --> 01:00:25,059
Gianni wrote...

1256
01:00:25,092 --> 01:00:28,262
how nice it was
for me to rub his dough.

1257
01:00:28,295 --> 01:00:29,964
Oh, my God.

1258
01:00:29,997 --> 01:00:32,366
And-and that it was a very
happy ending to his night.

1259
01:00:32,399 --> 01:00:33,734
Oh, God.

1260
01:00:33,767 --> 01:00:35,236
-Yowza.
-Oh, that's terrible.

1261
01:00:35,269 --> 01:00:38,005
-Oh, man. Shit, shit, shit.
-Oh, my God, I love it. More.

1262
01:00:38,038 --> 01:00:40,040
Got to call Bruce.

1263
01:00:42,776 --> 01:00:44,979
Why isn't it ringing?

1264
01:00:46,447 --> 01:00:49,283
-Still not going through.
-Oh.

1265
01:00:49,316 --> 01:00:51,252
It was all innocent, right?

1266
01:00:51,285 --> 01:00:52,753
Well, yes.

1267
01:00:52,786 --> 01:00:56,223
I mean, we flirted,
but I didn't...

1268
01:00:56,257 --> 01:00:57,925
Rub his dough?

1269
01:00:57,958 --> 01:00:58,826
Uh...

1270
01:00:58,859 --> 01:01:00,261
No.

1271
01:01:00,294 --> 01:01:01,795
Well, how about his meatballs?

1272
01:01:01,829 --> 01:01:03,797
-I'm serious.
-Oh, no, no, no.

1273
01:01:03,831 --> 01:01:05,900
But did you want to?

1274
01:01:05,933 --> 01:01:06,800
No.

1275
01:01:06,834 --> 01:01:10,104
I just was trying to have
a little fun.

1276
01:01:10,137 --> 01:01:14,375
You know, I-I can't have fun
like that with Bruce around.

1277
01:01:14,408 --> 01:01:15,709
Obviously not.

1278
01:01:15,743 --> 01:01:17,478
No. Not like that.

1279
01:01:17,512 --> 01:01:20,147
-Okay, sorry.
-Oh, what... like what, then?

1280
01:01:21,348 --> 01:01:23,150
Like where I don't
have to be afraid

1281
01:01:23,184 --> 01:01:26,754
that my husband's gonna
drop dead any second.

1282
01:01:27,454 --> 01:01:28,756
Mmm.

1283
01:01:28,789 --> 01:01:30,758
I-I just... What would it be?

1284
01:01:30,791 --> 01:01:32,493
What would my life be then?

1285
01:01:32,527 --> 01:01:34,929
It's one thing
to lose that restaurant,

1286
01:01:34,962 --> 01:01:37,932
but I just can't lose Bruce.

1287
01:01:39,501 --> 01:01:42,469
Okay. Best friends, tough love.

1288
01:01:42,504 --> 01:01:45,072
You know you're
the problem, right?

1289
01:01:45,906 --> 01:01:47,341
What are you talking about?

1290
01:01:47,374 --> 01:01:49,777
You're just so afraid
of Bruce dying

1291
01:01:49,810 --> 01:01:52,413
that you're stopping
the two of you from living.

1292
01:01:54,114 --> 01:01:57,785
Seriously, he's probably
thrilled you came on this trip.

1293
01:01:57,818 --> 01:02:00,454
The prison guard
finally left her post.

1294
01:02:00,487 --> 01:02:02,890
He's probably
getting his first taste

1295
01:02:02,923 --> 01:02:04,358
-of freedom, huh?
-Yeah.

1296
01:02:04,391 --> 01:02:06,528
Let the man get
a taste of bacon.

1297
01:02:06,561 --> 01:02:09,263
-That's not what's going on.
-Isn't it, though?

1298
01:02:09,296 --> 01:02:12,366
That is exactly
what is going on,

1299
01:02:12,399 --> 01:02:14,268
and you can't see it.

1300
01:02:14,301 --> 01:02:15,836
You want the truth?

1301
01:02:15,869 --> 01:02:18,372
"You can't handle the truth!"

1302
01:02:18,405 --> 01:02:20,174
Sorry, you set me up.

1303
01:02:20,207 --> 01:02:23,277
The truth is, at some point,

1304
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:25,813
Bruce actually
might not be here.

1305
01:02:25,846 --> 01:02:27,549
And I don't think
that anyone in this car

1306
01:02:27,582 --> 01:02:29,383
wants to see you look back

1307
01:02:29,416 --> 01:02:31,285
and realize all the time
you squandered

1308
01:02:31,318 --> 01:02:33,354
because you were afraid.

1309
01:02:33,387 --> 01:02:35,055
So knock it off.

1310
01:02:35,089 --> 01:02:37,024
Whoa, Viv.

1311
01:02:37,057 --> 01:02:39,561
-Mic drop.
-It's for your own good.

1312
01:02:39,594 --> 01:02:42,796
You've got a wonderful husband
who loves you.

1313
01:02:42,830 --> 01:02:45,933
And you're both...
you're alive and you're happy.

1314
01:02:45,966 --> 01:02:48,936
Stop trying to control
the uncontrollables.

1315
01:02:48,969 --> 01:02:51,372
Life is unpredictable,
and it's the surprises

1316
01:02:51,405 --> 01:02:53,541
that make it worth living.

1317
01:02:55,476 --> 01:02:58,012
Oh, my God!

1318
01:03:01,382 --> 01:03:03,083
We're okay.

1319
01:03:03,117 --> 01:03:04,351
Everything's fine.

1320
01:03:06,253 --> 01:03:08,889
-You know, it's the surprises,
isn't it? -Oh, God.

1321
01:03:08,922 --> 01:03:11,091
Tell me, what kind of car
doesn't come with a spare?

1322
01:03:11,125 --> 01:03:14,361
That one.

1323
01:03:14,395 --> 01:03:17,097
You know, I've never actually
hitchhiked before.

1324
01:03:17,131 --> 01:03:19,133
Yeah, well,
in my limited experience,

1325
01:03:19,166 --> 01:03:21,536
it helps if someone
actually drives by.

1326
01:03:23,003 --> 01:03:25,039
-Well, on the bright side...
-Mm-hmm?

1327
01:03:25,072 --> 01:03:27,107
...at least it's not raining.

1328
01:03:28,342 --> 01:03:30,144
Why do you tempt fate?

1329
01:03:30,177 --> 01:03:33,581
Well, th-there's no such thing
as fate, remember?

1330
01:03:40,087 --> 01:03:43,390
Is it too soon to talk about
who we're gonna eat first?

1331
01:03:45,192 --> 01:03:48,195
I think we all know.

1332
01:03:48,228 --> 01:03:49,930
Hey.

1333
01:03:49,963 --> 01:03:51,932
This is really not good.

1334
01:03:51,965 --> 01:03:54,201
Yeah, we know.

1335
01:03:54,234 --> 01:03:56,470
No, it's really not good.

1336
01:03:56,504 --> 01:03:59,006
Thank you for that
brand-new information.

1337
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:01,842
We need to get to Tuscany.

1338
01:04:02,644 --> 01:04:05,946
Well, yeah, but we don't need
to get panicky.

1339
01:04:05,979 --> 01:04:08,616
You know, w-we're not
under time pressure.

1340
01:04:08,650 --> 01:04:10,317
We can just relax. Chill.

1341
01:04:10,351 --> 01:04:13,987
I-I am relaxed, but we really
got to start walking now.

1342
01:04:14,021 --> 01:04:16,490
-Walk?
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.

1343
01:04:16,524 --> 01:04:18,225
To Tuscany?

1344
01:04:18,258 --> 01:04:21,061
Well, if we leave now,
we can be there by the morning,

1345
01:04:21,095 --> 01:04:23,063
so let's just get it up and go.

1346
01:04:23,097 --> 01:04:25,232
-All right, let's not get all...
-No.

1347
01:04:25,265 --> 01:04:27,067
Let's get!

1348
01:04:27,101 --> 01:04:29,269
Because I'm done
with the not getting, okay?

1349
01:04:29,303 --> 01:04:31,405
And this happened,
but there's still time.

1350
01:04:31,438 --> 01:04:33,675
-We got time.
-Calm down.

1351
01:04:33,708 --> 01:04:35,677
No. We have to be in Tuscany.

1352
01:04:35,710 --> 01:04:38,412
We're not not getting
to Tuscany, okay?

1353
01:04:38,445 --> 01:04:41,482
Diane, seriously, calm down.

1354
01:04:41,516 --> 01:04:43,016
I am.

1355
01:04:43,050 --> 01:04:47,421
I'm calm, and I'm gonna
be calmer in Tuscany.

1356
01:04:49,289 --> 01:04:51,158
What?

1357
01:04:52,025 --> 01:04:54,061
What-what... What was this look?

1358
01:04:54,094 --> 01:04:55,996
What the hell is going on?

1359
01:04:56,029 --> 01:04:58,399
I-I think
we should just tell her.

1360
01:04:58,432 --> 01:04:59,933
Tell me what?

1361
01:04:59,967 --> 01:05:02,136
I don't think we should.

1362
01:05:02,169 --> 01:05:03,103
Yes.

1363
01:05:03,137 --> 01:05:05,406
-Well, we have to now.
-Yeah. Yeah, you do.

1364
01:05:05,439 --> 01:05:07,474
You have to. What is going on?

1365
01:05:07,509 --> 01:05:09,476
-Well...
-What?

1366
01:05:09,511 --> 01:05:13,046
We need to get to Tuscany
because Arthur is there

1367
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:15,517
so that you guys
can get married tomorrow.

1368
01:05:15,550 --> 01:05:18,051
-Excuse me?
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1369
01:05:18,085 --> 01:05:20,421
He didn't want the wedding
to be a burden on you,

1370
01:05:20,454 --> 01:05:24,091
so when he heard about
the trip, he hatched a plan.

1371
01:05:24,124 --> 01:05:26,628
Which was actually
very thoughtful and sweet.

1372
01:05:26,661 --> 01:05:28,462
And we're screwing
the whole thing up

1373
01:05:28,495 --> 01:05:30,063
by dying by the side
of the road.

1374
01:05:30,097 --> 01:05:31,398
W-Wait just a minute.

1375
01:05:31,432 --> 01:05:33,735
Arthur is in Tuscany?

1376
01:05:33,768 --> 01:05:36,437
At the hotel,
and everyone flew in,

1377
01:05:36,470 --> 01:05:37,739
and everything is set up.

1378
01:05:37,772 --> 01:05:39,173
It's ready to go.

1379
01:05:39,206 --> 01:05:40,708
Y-You don't have to do anything.

1380
01:05:40,742 --> 01:05:43,143
Except show up,
which was our job.

1381
01:05:43,177 --> 01:05:44,978
And we're still gonna make it,

1382
01:05:45,012 --> 01:05:47,715
because the wedding is all set
for tomorrow morning.

1383
01:05:47,749 --> 01:05:50,117
So, surprise!

1384
01:05:50,150 --> 01:05:52,119
Huh?

1385
01:06:00,027 --> 01:06:01,995
She's not saying anything.

1386
01:06:02,029 --> 01:06:03,397
Do you think she's mad?

1387
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:04,599
Uh, maybe a little in shock.

1388
01:06:04,632 --> 01:06:05,999
-Viv?
-Yeah, just...

1389
01:06:06,033 --> 01:06:07,468
Wh-What are you thinking, Slim?

1390
01:06:07,502 --> 01:06:09,102
Huh?

1391
01:06:10,137 --> 01:06:12,039
Fuck!

1392
01:06:12,072 --> 01:06:13,407
At least she's talking.

1393
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,242
-Fuck!
-Oh, yikes.

1394
01:06:15,275 --> 01:06:17,244
A surprise wedding,
and this happens.

1395
01:06:17,277 --> 01:06:19,313
You do not see that as a sign?

1396
01:06:19,346 --> 01:06:23,685
I mean, a big sign that
this whole thing is doomed?

1397
01:06:23,718 --> 01:06:25,553
No. No, it's not.

1398
01:06:25,587 --> 01:06:27,789
-We're still gonna get there.
-And that is right,

1399
01:06:27,822 --> 01:06:29,323
because at any minute,

1400
01:06:29,356 --> 01:06:31,458
a car's gonna come
right down that road,

1401
01:06:31,492 --> 01:06:33,528
and we'll be on our way.

1402
01:06:35,797 --> 01:06:38,031
Well...

1403
01:06:38,065 --> 01:06:39,501
And if it doesn't?

1404
01:06:39,534 --> 01:06:41,068
Because it's...

1405
01:06:41,101 --> 01:06:43,437
feels like the world
is conspiring against me.

1406
01:06:43,470 --> 01:06:47,742
I mean, look, maybe this really
is not meant to be, guys,

1407
01:06:47,775 --> 01:06:49,577
and-and I just have to stop

1408
01:06:49,611 --> 01:06:51,579
blowing past
all the warning signs.

1409
01:06:51,613 --> 01:06:53,247
Wait, wait. Shut up for a sec.

1410
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:55,382
No, she's making a decent point.

1411
01:06:55,415 --> 01:06:56,518
Thank you.

1412
01:06:56,551 --> 01:06:58,051
Shh.

1413
01:06:58,085 --> 01:06:59,319
Do you hear that?

1414
01:06:59,353 --> 01:07:01,823
-What?
-I can't... I don't...

1415
01:07:01,856 --> 01:07:04,124
-Oh, my God. Look.
-Oh! Look!

1416
01:07:04,157 --> 01:07:05,392
Look. Look, look, look, look.

1417
01:07:05,425 --> 01:07:07,194
-A car!
-Oh, my God.

1418
01:07:07,227 --> 01:07:09,597
-Okay.
-Oh, my God.

1419
01:07:09,631 --> 01:07:10,832
Look alive, ladies.

1420
01:07:10,865 --> 01:07:12,499
We've got a wedding to get to!

1421
01:07:12,534 --> 01:07:14,536
-Don't let him drive past us.
-Oh, please, God, please.

1422
01:07:16,436 --> 01:07:17,805
How's that for a sign?

1423
01:07:17,839 --> 01:07:19,574
Our luck has turned.

1424
01:07:19,607 --> 01:07:21,709
Thank God.

1425
01:07:21,743 --> 01:07:24,411
Officer?

1426
01:07:24,444 --> 01:07:25,813
Oh.

1427
01:07:25,847 --> 01:07:27,214
Whoa.

1428
01:07:27,247 --> 01:07:28,716
Hi.

1429
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:30,150
<i>-Buonasera, signore.</i>
<i>-Buonasera.</i>

1430
01:07:31,686 --> 01:07:33,420
-What?
-Um...

1431
01:07:33,453 --> 01:07:34,421
Oh, we-we just...

1432
01:07:34,454 --> 01:07:36,423
-Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
-We... Wait. Oh.

1433
01:07:36,456 --> 01:07:38,425
-Well, I...
<i>-Parlate italiano?</i>

1434
01:07:38,458 --> 01:07:40,494
-Uh, no.
-No.

1435
01:07:40,528 --> 01:07:42,329
I can't believe you guys.

1436
01:07:42,362 --> 01:07:45,465
A buff cop
just happens to drive by.

1437
01:07:45,499 --> 01:07:46,534
-Uh...
-Oh, okay.

1438
01:07:46,568 --> 01:07:48,201
Let's go. Take your shirt off.

1439
01:07:48,235 --> 01:07:50,437
-What? No.
-No. N-No. No, Viv.

1440
01:07:50,470 --> 01:07:52,840
--What, you
want to start with the pants?

1441
01:07:52,874 --> 01:07:54,341
-Uh, no, no.
-Oh, oh, oh.

1442
01:07:54,374 --> 01:07:55,810
-No, y-you don't understand.
-Oh, I see.

1443
01:07:55,843 --> 01:07:57,311
You want me to help you?

1444
01:07:57,344 --> 01:07:58,813
-Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...
-No! What are you doing?

1445
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:01,281
No, wait. No, wait, wait.

1446
01:08:01,315 --> 01:08:02,717
Show us your concealed weapon.

1447
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:05,118
-No, Viv. Viv, stop.
-I-Ignore her.

1448
01:08:05,152 --> 01:08:07,522
-He's, um...
-This is not a stripper.

1449
01:08:07,555 --> 01:08:08,856
Oh, yeah. Nice try.

1450
01:08:08,890 --> 01:08:10,257
-Uh, uh, um...
-Oh!

1451
01:08:10,290 --> 01:08:12,794
We're sorry,
but th-that's our car,

1452
01:08:12,827 --> 01:08:16,731
and we don't have
a spare tire in it, so we...

1453
01:08:16,764 --> 01:08:17,865
we're hitchhiking.

1454
01:08:17,899 --> 01:08:19,601
Hitch... Ah, hitchhike.

1455
01:08:19,634 --> 01:08:21,769
-Okay.
-Yes.

1456
01:08:27,407 --> 01:08:30,277
It was...
it was an innocent mistake.

1457
01:08:30,310 --> 01:08:31,913
You know, and in my defense,

1458
01:08:31,946 --> 01:08:34,582
you guys have been
full of surprises.

1459
01:08:34,616 --> 01:08:36,751
And come on. You saw the guy.

1460
01:08:36,784 --> 01:08:39,887
It's been a while,
but he did have

1461
01:08:39,921 --> 01:08:43,457
some exotic-dancer-like
qualities.

1462
01:08:44,391 --> 01:08:46,728
I do think
he missed his calling.

1463
01:08:48,596 --> 01:08:51,498
Well, we-we had a good run,
didn't we?

1464
01:08:51,532 --> 01:08:53,668
-Hmm.
-I mean, we just pushed past

1465
01:08:53,701 --> 01:08:55,402
the point of common sense.

1466
01:08:55,435 --> 01:08:57,672
Who do we think we are,
The Rolling Stones?

1467
01:08:57,705 --> 01:09:01,542
And we just thought we'd keep
rocking forever? Ugh.

1468
01:09:01,576 --> 01:09:03,410
This needed to happen.

1469
01:09:03,443 --> 01:09:06,413
It did. It did.
This is the universe

1470
01:09:06,446 --> 01:09:08,382
hitting the eject button
on me and Arthur

1471
01:09:08,415 --> 01:09:09,851
-once and for all.
-Ugh.

1472
01:09:09,884 --> 01:09:13,721
Best friends, tough love.

1473
01:09:13,755 --> 01:09:18,559
Stop giving the universe
and fate credit for everything.

1474
01:09:18,593 --> 01:09:20,862
You're making a choice.

1475
01:09:20,895 --> 01:09:22,295
What?

1476
01:09:22,329 --> 01:09:25,465
We're on this trip
not because of fate

1477
01:09:25,499 --> 01:09:29,804
but because we're best friends
for 50 years.

1478
01:09:29,837 --> 01:09:31,939
We show up for each other.

1479
01:09:31,973 --> 01:09:35,610
Fate didn't bring us
on this trip.

1480
01:09:35,643 --> 01:09:37,277
Our love for each other did.

1481
01:09:37,310 --> 01:09:39,981
Love and the wonderful people
at Lufthansa.

1482
01:09:40,014 --> 01:09:42,249
It was a nice flight.

1483
01:09:42,282 --> 01:09:45,419
You're not marrying Arthur
because of fate.

1484
01:09:45,452 --> 01:09:48,990
You're marrying Arthur because
you put in the hard work.

1485
01:09:49,023 --> 01:09:50,825
Because you committed to him.

1486
01:09:50,858 --> 01:09:52,426
Because you love him.

1487
01:09:52,459 --> 01:09:55,697
That's a big deal,
and you should be proud of that.

1488
01:09:55,730 --> 01:09:57,799
She makes a really good point.

1489
01:09:57,832 --> 01:09:59,801
You should definitely
listen to her.

1490
01:09:59,834 --> 01:10:02,436
-Oh. And not you?
-Yeah.

1491
01:10:02,469 --> 01:10:04,739
I think things are just
a little bit different for me.

1492
01:10:04,772 --> 01:10:06,007
-Oh, God.
-What?

1493
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:07,875
Here we go.

1494
01:10:07,909 --> 01:10:10,243
Let me get out my tiny violin.

1495
01:10:10,277 --> 01:10:11,979
-What?
-Hey.

1496
01:10:12,013 --> 01:10:15,983
-Whoa.
-Best friends, tough love.

1497
01:10:16,017 --> 01:10:17,752
You always play the victim.

1498
01:10:17,785 --> 01:10:19,352
What are you talking about?

1499
01:10:19,386 --> 01:10:22,456
"I'm pregnant,
so I can't do this."

1500
01:10:22,489 --> 01:10:24,424
Or, "I'm married,
so I can't do that."

1501
01:10:24,458 --> 01:10:26,594
"I couldn't even try that

1502
01:10:26,627 --> 01:10:28,596
because I'm gonna fall flat
on my face."

1503
01:10:28,629 --> 01:10:31,899
You do think of excuses
not to do things.

1504
01:10:31,933 --> 01:10:33,701
Enough. Enough.

1505
01:10:33,735 --> 01:10:35,870
Okay, fine.

1506
01:10:35,903 --> 01:10:37,839
Yeah, okay.

1507
01:10:38,973 --> 01:10:40,407
What?

1508
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:42,744
Fine. I mean, I get it.

1509
01:10:42,777 --> 01:10:45,378
And you're right.

1510
01:10:46,547 --> 01:10:48,516
-Oh.
-Oh.

1511
01:10:48,549 --> 01:10:50,484
Okay. Good.

1512
01:10:53,921 --> 01:10:55,288
-Do me. Do my...
-What?

1513
01:10:55,322 --> 01:10:56,791
Do my tough love.

1514
01:11:01,929 --> 01:11:05,967
Honestly, I think
you are doing just fine.

1515
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,836
Yeah. I mean, I've got nothing.

1516
01:11:08,870 --> 01:11:12,907
You've... You made love
in a water taxi in Venice.

1517
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:16,043
You've had an amazing life.

1518
01:11:16,077 --> 01:11:17,845
Just don't get another cat.

1519
01:11:19,046 --> 01:11:20,480
-No.
-Oy.

1520
01:11:20,515 --> 01:11:22,382
-And there you have it.
-Ah.

1521
01:11:22,415 --> 01:11:24,786
We'll always have Venice.

1522
01:11:24,819 --> 01:11:26,053
Is that the line?

1523
01:11:26,087 --> 01:11:28,455
Paris.
"We'll always have Paris."

1524
01:11:28,488 --> 01:11:30,457
It's from <i>Casablanca.</i>

1525
01:11:30,490 --> 01:11:32,660
But Venice works, too.

1526
01:11:34,461 --> 01:11:36,363
-Okay.
-Oh, my God.

1527
01:11:36,396 --> 01:11:38,800
A good night of sleep
will make us all

1528
01:11:38,833 --> 01:11:40,835
feel better, I'm sure.

1529
01:11:40,868 --> 01:11:43,604
Luckily, that's not an option.

1530
01:11:54,916 --> 01:11:56,818
Well, well, well.

1531
01:11:58,485 --> 01:12:01,122
Look who it is.
Signora Troublemaker.

1532
01:12:01,155 --> 01:12:03,858
God. You again?

1533
01:12:03,891 --> 01:12:07,128
I should say the same thing.

1534
01:12:07,161 --> 01:12:08,896
I have some bad news.

1535
01:12:08,930 --> 01:12:10,531
The juicer's broken,

1536
01:12:10,565 --> 01:12:13,534
so our juice won't be
fresh-squeezed this morning?

1537
01:12:14,535 --> 01:12:17,138
Comedy. You don't do comedy?

1538
01:12:17,171 --> 01:12:18,840
I think you're growing on him.

1539
01:12:18,873 --> 01:12:20,074
-Rico.
-Oh.

1540
01:12:24,444 --> 01:12:29,016
Look what he got
from Trenitalia.

1541
01:12:30,450 --> 01:12:32,019
It was turned in
with your luggage tag.

1542
01:12:32,053 --> 01:12:33,855
-No.
-Oh, God.

1543
01:12:33,888 --> 01:12:36,123
You've got to be kidding me.

1544
01:12:36,157 --> 01:12:37,525
The ashes?

1545
01:12:37,558 --> 01:12:41,128
So, you're aware it's illegal?
Hmm?

1546
01:12:41,162 --> 01:12:43,130
-Oh, we had a feeling.
-Oh, God.

1547
01:12:43,164 --> 01:12:45,032
This wedding is doomed.

1548
01:12:45,066 --> 01:12:46,868
Wedding?

1549
01:12:46,901 --> 01:12:48,970
This is a bachelorette trip, no?

1550
01:12:49,003 --> 01:12:50,671
A surprise wedding.

1551
01:12:50,705 --> 01:12:52,173
Her first one.

1552
01:12:52,206 --> 01:12:55,009
Oh. I'm sorry.

1553
01:12:55,042 --> 01:12:57,078
You don't have to be
a jerk about it.

1554
01:12:57,111 --> 01:12:58,746
I'm not. I mean it.

1555
01:12:58,779 --> 01:13:02,750
Although, in hindsight, I wish
I missed my first wedding.

1556
01:13:02,783 --> 01:13:04,585
Maybe it's a blessing.

1557
01:13:04,619 --> 01:13:07,021
No. This one was meant to be.

1558
01:13:07,054 --> 01:13:09,023
Well, obviously not.

1559
01:13:09,056 --> 01:13:10,558
We're destined to fail.

1560
01:13:10,591 --> 01:13:12,159
I'm not cut out to be married.

1561
01:13:12,193 --> 01:13:13,861
I think we can all
agree on that.

1562
01:13:13,895 --> 01:13:16,496
Chief, are you happy
you got to be part of the end

1563
01:13:16,530 --> 01:13:17,965
of this fairy tale
for this woman?

1564
01:13:17,999 --> 01:13:19,800
Does that make you feel good?

1565
01:13:20,735 --> 01:13:22,803
No, actually.

1566
01:13:22,837 --> 01:13:24,437
But this is life.

1567
01:13:24,471 --> 01:13:25,840
It's not fair.

1568
01:13:25,873 --> 01:13:28,142
It doesn't always feel good.

1569
01:13:28,175 --> 01:13:30,578
But what can I do?

1570
01:13:30,611 --> 01:13:32,947
No one ever thinks
they can do anything.

1571
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:35,716
I... I'm so sick of it.

1572
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:38,920
Everyone always just throws up
their hand and says,

1573
01:13:38,953 --> 01:13:40,788
"Well, it's not meant to be."

1574
01:13:40,821 --> 01:13:42,056
It's pathetic.

1575
01:13:42,089 --> 01:13:44,058
Y-You're a police chief.

1576
01:13:44,091 --> 01:13:46,193
Don't tell me
you got into this work

1577
01:13:46,227 --> 01:13:48,930
without wanting to make
a difference, did you?

1578
01:13:48,963 --> 01:13:50,631
Didn't you think,

1579
01:13:50,665 --> 01:13:52,133
"I'm the good guy,
I'm the hero"?

1580
01:13:52,166 --> 01:13:53,601
Isn't that what you thought?

1581
01:13:53,634 --> 01:13:55,202
And-and-and now what?

1582
01:13:55,236 --> 01:13:57,939
Nothing? Now "that's life"?

1583
01:13:57,972 --> 01:13:59,073
No.

1584
01:13:59,106 --> 01:14:01,075
Life is what you make of it.

1585
01:14:01,108 --> 01:14:02,576
So do something.

1586
01:14:02,610 --> 01:14:04,011
Do something brave.

1587
01:14:04,045 --> 01:14:07,081
Do something unexpected.

1588
01:14:07,114 --> 01:14:08,716
But do something,

1589
01:14:08,749 --> 01:14:10,751
because you have four women
in a jail cell

1590
01:14:10,785 --> 01:14:14,188
who are desperately hoping
for a reason to believe

1591
01:14:14,221 --> 01:14:17,490
there's still
a reason to believe.

1592
01:14:20,094 --> 01:14:22,229
So do something, goddamn it,

1593
01:14:22,263 --> 01:14:26,000
because this isn't the end
of the freaking story.

1594
01:14:31,872 --> 01:14:33,841
I have an idea.

1595
01:14:36,277 --> 01:14:38,679
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, you're letting us go?

1596
01:14:40,614 --> 01:14:43,017
Oh, God.
Tell me that clock is fast.

1597
01:14:43,050 --> 01:14:44,852
Nothing in this country is fast.

1598
01:15:12,847 --> 01:15:14,915
Chief.

1599
01:15:15,716 --> 01:15:17,952
I've got one passenger

1600
01:15:17,985 --> 01:15:20,688
that needs to be dropped off
a little early.

1601
01:15:20,721 --> 01:15:23,324
You think you could
make that happen?

1602
01:15:23,357 --> 01:15:25,960
That would require a permit.

1603
01:15:25,993 --> 01:15:28,095
-Oh.
-Wait.

1604
01:15:28,129 --> 01:15:32,099
Or a special...
special police permission.

1605
01:15:37,038 --> 01:15:39,006
I know a place.

1606
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:51,352
-Go for it.
-Huh?

1607
01:15:51,385 --> 01:15:53,054
Go for it.

1608
01:15:53,087 --> 01:15:54,889
You can do it, Diane.

1609
01:15:54,922 --> 01:15:57,058
Careful, Diane!

1610
01:15:57,091 --> 01:15:58,225
Careful!

1611
01:15:58,259 --> 01:16:00,061
I can't open it.

1612
01:16:01,028 --> 01:16:03,164
The top, it's stuck.

1613
01:16:04,131 --> 01:16:06,000
I can't... I... What the...

1614
01:16:06,033 --> 01:16:08,169
I can't open it.

1615
01:16:08,202 --> 01:16:09,336
Oh, my God!

1616
01:16:09,370 --> 01:16:11,806
Diane!

1617
01:16:11,839 --> 01:16:13,874
-Oh, my... Careful!
-Oh, careful!

1618
01:16:13,908 --> 01:16:16,110
Oh, God.

1619
01:16:17,078 --> 01:16:18,946
I did it.

1620
01:16:24,819 --> 01:16:27,188
He really was such a good man.

1621
01:16:27,221 --> 01:16:29,323
-He really was.
-Yeah.

1622
01:16:29,356 --> 01:16:31,325
I really did love him.

1623
01:16:31,358 --> 01:16:33,694
He loved you, too.

1624
01:16:33,727 --> 01:16:35,296
-He would've liked this, right?
-Yeah.

1625
01:16:35,329 --> 01:16:38,099
I mean, well,
minus the skydiving part.

1626
01:16:41,102 --> 01:16:42,837
-Thank you.
-Oh.

1627
01:17:12,833 --> 01:17:15,903
I knew I liked you
the moment I met you.

1628
01:17:15,936 --> 01:17:18,906
For me,
it took a little longer.

1629
01:17:20,107 --> 01:17:22,042
How can I repay you?

1630
01:17:22,943 --> 01:17:25,980
Save me a dance,
and we call it even.

1631
01:17:26,013 --> 01:17:29,049
Bring the handcuffs,
and you've got a deal.

1632
01:17:34,788 --> 01:17:37,024
<i>Buongiorno!</i>

1633
01:17:37,992 --> 01:17:39,293
The bride is here.

1634
01:17:39,326 --> 01:17:40,895
<i>Grazie al Signore.</i>

1635
01:17:40,928 --> 01:17:44,798
My name is Pasquale,
and I'm ready to marry you.

1636
01:17:44,832 --> 01:17:47,001
Get in line, Pasquale.

1637
01:17:47,034 --> 01:17:48,135
She's taken.

1638
01:17:49,504 --> 01:17:52,039
I sleep, breathe...
I dream your wedding.

1639
01:17:52,072 --> 01:17:54,441
I live to make
this wedding happen.

1640
01:17:54,475 --> 01:17:57,311
It is my oxygen.

1641
01:17:57,344 --> 01:17:58,979
That's so nice. Thank you.

1642
01:17:59,013 --> 01:18:01,882
Yes, but do you think that
maybe we should get going?

1643
01:18:01,916 --> 01:18:03,317
<i>Sì, si, sì, si. Andiamo.</i>

1644
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:05,452
Music to my ears.

1645
01:18:05,486 --> 01:18:07,354
Oh, my God.

1646
01:18:07,388 --> 01:18:10,324
Only a little behind schedule.

1647
01:18:10,357 --> 01:18:11,926
No worries.

1648
01:18:11,959 --> 01:18:14,128
I will check on the groom
and be back to you

1649
01:18:14,161 --> 01:18:16,096
<i>-molto, molto presto.</i>
-Oh, thank you.

1650
01:18:17,898 --> 01:18:18,866
Yeah.

1651
01:18:18,899 --> 01:18:20,067
Oh. I-I'm gonna go call Bruce.

1652
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:21,202
-Oh.
-I'll catch up.

1653
01:18:21,235 --> 01:18:22,303
-Okay. Okay.
-O-Okay, great.

1654
01:18:22,336 --> 01:18:23,871
Let-let's meet in Viv's room.

1655
01:18:23,904 --> 01:18:26,941
-We made it.
-Yes.

1656
01:18:39,787 --> 01:18:41,021
Few moment more.

1657
01:18:41,055 --> 01:18:42,790
<i>Per favore. Per favore.</i>

1658
01:18:45,492 --> 01:18:47,127
Ciao, Pasquale.

1659
01:18:47,161 --> 01:18:48,963
Signor Arthur!

1660
01:18:52,032 --> 01:18:53,400
Signor Arthur.

1661
01:18:53,434 --> 01:18:55,369
What's the good word, Pasquale?

1662
01:18:55,402 --> 01:18:59,306
I am very happy to say your
bride-to-be is officially here.

1663
01:18:59,340 --> 01:19:00,975
Shall I take you to her?

1664
01:19:01,008 --> 01:19:03,143
Oh, I believe that
it's bad luck for the groom

1665
01:19:03,177 --> 01:19:05,379
to see the bride
before the ceremony, isn't it?

1666
01:19:05,412 --> 01:19:07,047
I don't believe in luck.

1667
01:19:07,081 --> 01:19:08,315
I believe in love.

1668
01:19:09,551 --> 01:19:11,185
Well, that's why we're all here.

1669
01:19:11,218 --> 01:19:14,355
But when you've waited
as long as I have,

1670
01:19:14,388 --> 01:19:16,090
what's a few more minutes?

1671
01:19:16,123 --> 01:19:18,125
It's true.

1672
01:19:27,201 --> 01:19:30,104
Oh, my God.

1673
01:19:30,137 --> 01:19:33,774
This is the best sight
I've seen in all of Italy.

1674
01:19:34,942 --> 01:19:36,210
Oh.

1675
01:19:36,243 --> 01:19:37,478
I missed you so much.

1676
01:19:37,512 --> 01:19:39,780
Mmm.

1677
01:19:41,482 --> 01:19:43,384
You think this is really
gonna happen?

1678
01:19:43,417 --> 01:19:45,085
Mm-hmm.

1679
01:19:45,119 --> 01:19:46,887
-I do. I think so.
-Mm. Good.

1680
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:48,590
-Yeah.
-I love a wedding.

1681
01:19:48,623 --> 01:19:51,058
Such a romantic.

1682
01:19:51,091 --> 01:19:52,960
-I better change, though.
-Better not.

1683
01:19:52,993 --> 01:19:54,828
-Oh. -I love you
just the way you are.

1684
01:19:54,862 --> 01:19:57,565
Oh, come on. Don't burn up
all your romanticism.

1685
01:19:57,599 --> 01:19:59,400
I mean, we still got
a long day ahead of us.

1686
01:19:59,433 --> 01:20:02,136
You know I don't...

1687
01:20:02,169 --> 01:20:03,270
Oh, my God.

1688
01:20:03,304 --> 01:20:05,072
Oh, Mitchell.

1689
01:20:05,105 --> 01:20:07,341
-What did you do?
-I had no choice.

1690
01:20:07,374 --> 01:20:10,512
When I saw that picture, I...
I had to make a call.

1691
01:20:10,545 --> 01:20:12,346
I can't wear this, can I?

1692
01:20:12,379 --> 01:20:16,450
Donato assured me that this
dress was <i>perfetto</i> for today.

1693
01:20:16,483 --> 01:20:18,385
So, who am I to argue?

1694
01:20:19,219 --> 01:20:20,588
You're real trouble,
you know that?

1695
01:20:20,622 --> 01:20:22,222
That's why I'm here.

1696
01:20:24,892 --> 01:20:26,994
Yeah. Trouble.

1697
01:20:33,233 --> 01:20:35,102
Oh, Viv.

1698
01:20:35,903 --> 01:20:38,072
Look at you.

1699
01:20:38,906 --> 01:20:41,509
You look truly beautiful.

1700
01:20:41,543 --> 01:20:43,243
You think? Yeah?

1701
01:20:43,277 --> 01:20:45,446
-Thank you.
-Stunning.

1702
01:20:45,479 --> 01:20:47,649
Thank you. So do you.

1703
01:20:47,682 --> 01:20:50,451
Are we ready for this?

1704
01:20:50,484 --> 01:20:52,286
Oh, my goodness.

1705
01:20:52,319 --> 01:20:53,487
Oh, hi.

1706
01:20:53,521 --> 01:20:55,089
That's the dress.

1707
01:20:55,122 --> 01:20:57,057
-Uh-huh.
-How did you get it?

1708
01:20:57,091 --> 01:20:59,093
-Oh, Mitchell.
-Oh, my God.

1709
01:20:59,126 --> 01:21:01,495
This guy pulls things
out of his sleeve.

1710
01:21:01,529 --> 01:21:02,930
I know.

1711
01:21:02,963 --> 01:21:04,566
Bruce still isn't
answering his phone.

1712
01:21:04,599 --> 01:21:06,200
-Oh.
-Sorry.

1713
01:21:06,233 --> 01:21:07,401
Oh.

1714
01:21:07,434 --> 01:21:09,269
-Oh, my God.
-Oh!

1715
01:21:09,303 --> 01:21:11,438
You all look so beautiful.

1716
01:21:11,472 --> 01:21:13,006
Oh, God.

1717
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:16,210
Oh, God.
Why do I feel so nervous?

1718
01:21:16,243 --> 01:21:18,646
No, it's-it's just
wedding day jitters.

1719
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:21,115
It's just totally normal.

1720
01:21:27,154 --> 01:21:28,322
This is it.

1721
01:21:28,355 --> 01:21:29,691
-Yeah.
-This is it.

1722
01:21:29,724 --> 01:21:32,025
It's gonna be great.

1723
01:21:33,327 --> 01:21:35,963
Can I just say
how much I love you all?

1724
01:21:35,996 --> 01:21:38,265
And this was
the best bachelorette trip

1725
01:21:38,298 --> 01:21:39,534
I could imagine.

1726
01:21:39,567 --> 01:21:41,135
That is so good,

1727
01:21:41,168 --> 01:21:43,103
because it's the best one
we could've thrown.

1728
01:21:43,137 --> 01:21:44,639
Yeah. Big-time.

1729
01:21:44,672 --> 01:21:46,674
We way over-delivered.

1730
01:21:46,708 --> 01:21:49,109
-Yeah, what else is new?
-Yeah.

1731
01:21:49,143 --> 01:21:50,444
-Okay, I need a hug.
-Ooh!

1732
01:21:50,477 --> 01:21:51,713
All right.

1733
01:21:51,746 --> 01:21:54,047
Aw.

1734
01:21:55,382 --> 01:21:56,684
You're the loves of my life.

1735
01:21:56,718 --> 01:21:58,018
-You know that.
-No.

1736
01:21:58,051 --> 01:22:00,020
Oh, we love you, too.

1737
01:22:00,053 --> 01:22:02,690
And I love you all,
but it's time.

1738
01:22:02,724 --> 01:22:04,726
Let's get you in that dress.

1739
01:22:04,759 --> 01:22:06,628
Okay.

1740
01:22:06,661 --> 01:22:09,296
Oh, here.

1741
01:22:09,329 --> 01:22:10,565
-Mmm.
-Oh.

1742
01:22:10,598 --> 01:22:14,034
Um, yeah.

1743
01:22:14,067 --> 01:22:16,236
I hope that was mine.

1744
01:22:16,270 --> 01:22:18,338
-Whoa.
-Oh. -Oh.

1745
01:22:20,407 --> 01:22:22,042
-Hmm.
-Okay.

1746
01:22:22,075 --> 01:22:25,012
Well, one of these
was definitely not mine.

1747
01:22:25,713 --> 01:22:28,248
Showtime, people.

1748
01:22:31,619 --> 01:22:34,087
For real this time.

1749
01:22:39,594 --> 01:22:42,095
Well, here we go.

1750
01:22:43,497 --> 01:22:45,633
Oh, God.

1751
01:22:45,667 --> 01:22:47,434
-What?
-What?

1752
01:22:47,468 --> 01:22:48,636
What?

1753
01:22:48,670 --> 01:22:50,672
-I think I'm gonna be sick.
-Oh, no.

1754
01:22:50,705 --> 01:22:52,507
Well, you know
what that means, don't you?

1755
01:22:52,540 --> 01:22:53,741
No. What?

1756
01:22:53,775 --> 01:22:55,409
You're pregnant.

1757
01:22:55,442 --> 01:22:57,779
I mean, at least that's
what it meant at my wedding.

1758
01:22:59,179 --> 01:23:00,582
-Seriously, I...
-Huh? Huh?

1759
01:23:00,615 --> 01:23:02,617
This is crazy.

1760
01:23:02,650 --> 01:23:04,752
I don't know why
I agreed to do this.

1761
01:23:04,786 --> 01:23:06,420
I mean, it makes no sense.

1762
01:23:06,453 --> 01:23:08,656
Of course not.
But don't you understand?

1763
01:23:08,690 --> 01:23:11,158
That's what makes it so amazing.

1764
01:23:11,191 --> 01:23:14,027
Loving someone
and having them love you

1765
01:23:14,061 --> 01:23:15,730
is reason enough.

1766
01:23:15,763 --> 01:23:18,499
Look at you. Look where we are.

1767
01:23:18,533 --> 01:23:20,167
Look at what we've been through.

1768
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:21,803
We made it. And you, Viv.

1769
01:23:21,836 --> 01:23:23,805
You have never been one
to follow the flock,

1770
01:23:23,838 --> 01:23:26,574
because you are
your own drummer boy, okay?

1771
01:23:26,608 --> 01:23:28,108
So just trust your heart, Viv.

1772
01:23:28,141 --> 01:23:30,110
Trust it. Trust it.

1773
01:23:30,143 --> 01:23:31,779
'Cause it always
guides you right.

1774
01:23:31,813 --> 01:23:33,515
Always.

1775
01:23:34,516 --> 01:23:36,116
She's right, Slim.

1776
01:23:36,149 --> 01:23:38,520
You deserve
your fairy-tale ending.

1777
01:23:38,553 --> 01:23:39,754
Let's go get it.

1778
01:23:39,787 --> 01:23:41,255
Yeah, you've earned it.

1779
01:23:41,288 --> 01:23:43,123
Think of all we've overcome
to get here.

1780
01:23:43,156 --> 01:23:46,493
That's true, and now
all the problems are behind us.

1781
01:23:48,863 --> 01:23:50,732
We have a problem.

1782
01:23:50,765 --> 01:23:52,834
I knew as soon as I said it.

1783
01:23:52,867 --> 01:23:56,538
It's fine. We are going
to make a little pause.

1784
01:23:56,571 --> 01:23:57,539
A pause?

1785
01:23:57,572 --> 01:23:59,172
Wha... Wh-Why?

1786
01:23:59,206 --> 01:24:01,174
The priest is missing.

1787
01:24:02,577 --> 01:24:04,411
The priest is missing?

1788
01:24:07,582 --> 01:24:09,316
This feels like a bad omen.

1789
01:24:09,349 --> 01:24:10,585
Mm-mm-mm.

1790
01:24:11,586 --> 01:24:13,453
Oh, fine.

1791
01:24:13,487 --> 01:24:15,389
I'll do it.

1792
01:24:15,422 --> 01:24:16,691
What?

1793
01:24:16,724 --> 01:24:18,693
I'll perform the ceremony.

1794
01:24:19,861 --> 01:24:21,663
-Really?
-Yeah. I'll marry you.

1795
01:24:21,696 --> 01:24:23,798
-What?
-Yes!

1796
01:24:23,831 --> 01:24:26,099
What good is a judicial title

1797
01:24:26,133 --> 01:24:29,169
if you can't degrade yourself
in front of your friends?

1798
01:24:29,202 --> 01:24:30,470
Come on. Let's do it.

1799
01:24:30,505 --> 01:24:32,807
Yeah. Yes.

1800
01:24:36,209 --> 01:24:38,613
The wedding is back on.

1801
01:24:38,646 --> 01:24:40,347
From the top.

1802
01:24:41,749 --> 01:24:44,084
Hey.

1803
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:54,596
Nice save, Your Honor.

1804
01:24:54,629 --> 01:24:57,164
You have no idea.

1805
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:02,369
Okay, and now it's time.

1806
01:25:02,402 --> 01:25:04,137
Ah. It's time.

1807
01:25:04,171 --> 01:25:05,740
Mm.

1808
01:25:05,773 --> 01:25:07,642
-Okay.
-It's time.

1809
01:25:07,675 --> 01:25:09,510
Ooh.

1810
01:25:09,544 --> 01:25:12,614
-Oh, oh, that's-that's me.
-What? Oh.

1811
01:25:12,647 --> 01:25:14,649
Sorry. Oh, it's Bruce.

1812
01:25:14,682 --> 01:25:16,350
-Go. Take it.
-Uh, no.

1813
01:25:16,383 --> 01:25:18,352
-I can call him back.
-Take it!

1814
01:25:18,385 --> 01:25:19,353
Okay.

1815
01:25:19,386 --> 01:25:22,389
-Bruce? Hi.
<i>-Un min... momento.</i>

1816
01:25:28,328 --> 01:25:29,897
Continue, please.

1817
01:25:29,931 --> 01:25:31,799
Continue.
Just one more tiny moment.

1818
01:25:31,833 --> 01:25:34,669
<i>Grazie. Grazie, grazie.</i>

1819
01:25:37,672 --> 01:25:39,941
I got your message, Carol.

1820
01:25:39,974 --> 01:25:42,610
I also got your pictures.

1821
01:25:42,644 --> 01:25:44,646
The ones with you and Dough Boy.

1822
01:25:44,679 --> 01:25:46,313
It isn't what you think.

1823
01:25:46,346 --> 01:25:48,348
What are you trying to do,
give me another heart attack?

1824
01:25:48,382 --> 01:25:50,918
-Is that your plan?
-No. No, Bruce.

1825
01:25:50,952 --> 01:25:52,920
Don't even joke about that.

1826
01:25:52,954 --> 01:25:54,789
Believe me, when I get home,

1827
01:25:54,822 --> 01:25:57,391
things are gonna be
so different.

1828
01:25:57,424 --> 01:26:00,460
Our adventure isn't over yet.

1829
01:26:00,494 --> 01:26:03,196
I never should've told you
not to come. It...

1830
01:26:03,230 --> 01:26:04,699
Are you sure?

1831
01:26:04,732 --> 01:26:08,435
If I could snap my fingers
and fix it all, I would. I...

1832
01:26:08,468 --> 01:26:11,706
Y-You should be here.
It's so beautiful.

1833
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:15,710
You don't think the flowers
are a little bit overdone?

1834
01:26:15,743 --> 01:26:17,411
What?

1835
01:26:17,444 --> 01:26:19,279
The flowers.

1836
01:26:19,312 --> 01:26:21,649
I think there's one too many.

1837
01:26:26,286 --> 01:26:28,690
Well, that's better.

1838
01:26:28,723 --> 01:26:30,658
-Oh, my God.
-Hi.

1839
01:26:30,692 --> 01:26:33,293
-Bruce, you're here.
-Hey.

1840
01:26:33,326 --> 01:26:35,530
Oh, God. I can't believe it.

1841
01:26:35,563 --> 01:26:37,598
Well, I wasn't gonna miss
the chance to walk

1842
01:26:37,632 --> 01:26:39,901
my favorite girl down the aisle.
Come on.

1843
01:26:39,934 --> 01:26:42,436
Unless, of course,
you prefer Dough Boy.

1844
01:26:42,469 --> 01:26:44,739
I've got his number.
Do you want me to call him?

1845
01:26:44,772 --> 01:26:46,007
Shut up and kiss me.

1846
01:26:47,875 --> 01:26:49,677
Mmm.

1847
01:26:51,012 --> 01:26:53,715
Mmm.

1848
01:26:53,748 --> 01:26:57,250
Oh, this is Bruce. Sorry.

1849
01:26:57,284 --> 01:26:59,887
Oh, thank goodness.
Bruce is here.

1850
01:27:03,024 --> 01:27:05,292
To make it official.

1851
01:27:10,732 --> 01:27:11,866
Nice dress.

1852
01:27:11,899 --> 01:27:13,333
-You like it?
-Mm-hmm.

1853
01:27:13,366 --> 01:27:15,002
-I just found it in the closet.
-Mm.

1854
01:27:15,036 --> 01:27:16,537
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

1855
01:27:16,571 --> 01:27:17,805
Mm-hmm.

1856
01:27:45,933 --> 01:27:48,268
Wow.

1857
01:28:17,965 --> 01:28:19,600
Well...

1858
01:28:19,634 --> 01:28:23,538
...here we all are,
which is shocking.

1859
01:28:23,571 --> 01:28:27,008
And not just because we spent
last night in a jail cell.

1860
01:28:27,041 --> 01:28:30,845
It's shocking because
I've known this woman

1861
01:28:30,878 --> 01:28:33,114
since we were 19 years old

1862
01:28:33,147 --> 01:28:36,017
and I never thought
there would be a man

1863
01:28:36,050 --> 01:28:39,987
she was willing
to walk down the aisle for.

1864
01:28:40,021 --> 01:28:41,789
But there is such a man,

1865
01:28:41,823 --> 01:28:45,358
and he's well deserved
of that unique achievement.

1866
01:28:46,727 --> 01:28:50,430
And of my dear friend's hand
in marriage.

1867
01:28:51,032 --> 01:28:53,534
-To begin...
-Um, uh, h-hold...

1868
01:28:53,568 --> 01:28:56,403
Can I... Can I just say
something quickly?

1869
01:28:56,436 --> 01:28:59,372
O-Of course.
This is your big day.

1870
01:29:01,609 --> 01:29:04,145
Arthur, is it okay if I talk
to you for just a second

1871
01:29:04,178 --> 01:29:06,581
as though I didn't have
this dress on and...

1872
01:29:06,614 --> 01:29:09,382
and you didn't have
two rings in your pocket?

1873
01:29:10,518 --> 01:29:12,520
Sure.

1874
01:29:13,453 --> 01:29:17,625
The truth is
I never wanted to be a wife.

1875
01:29:18,626 --> 01:29:21,529
You know, I always saw
a wedding ring as a chain.

1876
01:29:21,562 --> 01:29:24,732
You know, a...
a one-link chain of...

1877
01:29:24,765 --> 01:29:26,801
of limitation.

1878
01:29:28,836 --> 01:29:33,941
But there is no limit to
the love that I have for you.

1879
01:29:33,975 --> 01:29:36,811
You know,
that's what I've realized.

1880
01:29:36,844 --> 01:29:40,514
That's why I'm here today.

1881
01:29:40,548 --> 01:29:42,516
I love you, Arthur.

1882
01:29:42,550 --> 01:29:45,019
I love you. I want to move
to New York with you.

1883
01:29:45,052 --> 01:29:46,721
I want to walk
in the streets with you.

1884
01:29:46,754 --> 01:29:49,123
I want to make love
in the park with you.

1885
01:29:49,156 --> 01:29:51,125
Well, not the dirty part
of the park.

1886
01:29:52,526 --> 01:29:54,195
You know, the-the clean part,

1887
01:29:54,228 --> 01:29:57,098
with the trees and the grass
and no syringes.

1888
01:30:00,034 --> 01:30:03,638
We've spent a lifetime apart.

1889
01:30:03,671 --> 01:30:06,540
Now we have to figure out a way
how to squeeze a lifetime

1890
01:30:06,574 --> 01:30:08,109
into the time we have left.

1891
01:30:08,142 --> 01:30:10,177
And we can do it.

1892
01:30:10,211 --> 01:30:12,479
We can.

1893
01:30:13,614 --> 01:30:16,717
I choose you, Arthur Riley.

1894
01:30:16,751 --> 01:30:20,922
I choose you today
and every day.

1895
01:30:22,590 --> 01:30:24,759
You may kiss the bride.

1896
01:30:24,792 --> 01:30:26,060
Wait.

1897
01:30:26,093 --> 01:30:27,595
Aren't I supposed
to say something?

1898
01:30:27,628 --> 01:30:29,864
Oh. Oh, right, sorry.
I-I got swept away.

1899
01:30:29,897 --> 01:30:33,801
And-and now,
Arthur with his closing remarks.

1900
01:30:33,834 --> 01:30:35,836
Vows, whatever. Go.

1901
01:30:42,677 --> 01:30:45,046
You don't want to be
a wife, do you?

1902
01:30:47,515 --> 01:30:49,517
You don't want to be married.

1903
01:30:49,550 --> 01:30:51,886
That's what you just said,
isn't it?

1904
01:30:51,919 --> 01:30:54,622
Yes, I-I guess I did, yeah.

1905
01:30:55,823 --> 01:30:57,658
There was a part of me
that believed

1906
01:30:57,692 --> 01:31:00,695
that you really wanted
to be married, but...

1907
01:31:02,129 --> 01:31:04,532
...who was I kidding?

1908
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:07,501
I knew you'd do this.

1909
01:31:07,535 --> 01:31:09,737
I knew it.

1910
01:31:14,775 --> 01:31:16,711
Vivian...

1911
01:31:17,678 --> 01:31:19,714
I don't need
the title of husband,

1912
01:31:19,747 --> 01:31:22,717
and I don't need
the institution of marriage

1913
01:31:22,750 --> 01:31:25,820
to know that I'm gonna
choose you every day.

1914
01:31:26,921 --> 01:31:30,858
I proposed to you
when we were in our 20s

1915
01:31:30,891 --> 01:31:34,528
'cause I was so damn in love
with you that I-I knew then

1916
01:31:34,562 --> 01:31:37,031
that I wanted to spend
the rest of my life with you.

1917
01:31:37,965 --> 01:31:42,536
And as luck would have it,
or some divine masterstroke,

1918
01:31:42,570 --> 01:31:44,739
we reconnected.

1919
01:31:44,772 --> 01:31:47,742
And I'll be damned
if I don't still feel the same.

1920
01:31:49,243 --> 01:31:51,779
But a little differently.

1921
01:31:52,613 --> 01:31:55,716
Oh, I don't love you any less.

1922
01:31:55,750 --> 01:31:58,853
And I think I may
understand you a little better.

1923
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:02,323
You're...

1924
01:32:02,356 --> 01:32:06,594
like this ring that I'm holding.

1925
01:32:06,627 --> 01:32:10,598
A complete and perfect circle
unto your own.

1926
01:32:10,631 --> 01:32:12,867
And if you're not always free

1927
01:32:12,900 --> 01:32:16,070
to roll on your own
the way you want,

1928
01:32:16,103 --> 01:32:18,539
then you're not you.

1929
01:32:19,173 --> 01:32:22,777
And it's you that I love.

1930
01:32:25,079 --> 01:32:27,081
You're my perfect circle.

1931
01:32:29,150 --> 01:32:32,219
So, if you'll allow me
a do-over,

1932
01:32:32,253 --> 01:32:35,689
I'd like to ask
my question again.

1933
01:32:36,757 --> 01:32:39,193
Aw.

1934
01:32:39,226 --> 01:32:42,663
Vivian, I love you
with all my heart.

1935
01:32:42,696 --> 01:32:46,867
That has never changed,
and it never will.

1936
01:32:47,701 --> 01:32:50,938
But I just got to know...

1937
01:32:50,971 --> 01:32:53,074
will you not marry me?

1938
01:32:55,176 --> 01:32:58,112
There's nothing I'd love more.

1939
01:32:59,713 --> 01:33:03,084
You're supposed to wait
for my cue.

1940
01:33:03,117 --> 01:33:04,819
Nobody ever waits for my cue.

1941
01:33:04,852 --> 01:33:08,389
May you always love each other
as you do today.

1942
01:33:08,422 --> 01:33:12,726
I now pronounce you
not husband and wife.

1943
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:14,095
Yes!

1944
01:33:14,128 --> 01:33:15,262
Yay!

1945
01:33:15,296 --> 01:33:16,630
Oh, my God!

1946
01:33:17,865 --> 01:33:19,366
-Thanks, man.
-Oh, my God.

1947
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:20,267
Congratulations,
you handsome devil.

1948
01:33:20,301 --> 01:33:22,303
He gets it!

1949
01:33:25,406 --> 01:33:27,741
Thank you.

1950
01:33:30,177 --> 01:33:31,979
We did it.

1951
01:33:32,012 --> 01:33:33,981
We made it to the end!

1952
01:33:39,019 --> 01:33:40,855
-Wait a second. Come on.
-What? What do you mean?

1953
01:33:40,888 --> 01:33:42,323
-Get back up here.
-Wait, what?

1954
01:33:42,356 --> 01:33:43,691
-Get back up here.
-Oh.

1955
01:33:43,724 --> 01:33:45,359
Can we wait one second, please?

1956
01:33:45,392 --> 01:33:47,661
Hmm?

1957
01:33:47,695 --> 01:33:49,163
Give me one second.

1958
01:33:50,764 --> 01:33:52,299
You said some things back there
about marriage

1959
01:33:52,333 --> 01:33:54,101
I've never heard you say before.

1960
01:33:54,135 --> 01:33:55,736
Uh-huh.

1961
01:33:55,769 --> 01:33:57,404
Uh, can we pause the music
a second, please?

1962
01:34:02,042 --> 01:34:05,679
Did you mean what you said--
that love was reason enough--

1963
01:34:05,713 --> 01:34:07,748
or were those just words?

1964
01:34:07,781 --> 01:34:10,117
Mitchell, is this really
the best time?

1965
01:34:10,151 --> 01:34:12,119
I think it is.

1966
01:34:12,153 --> 01:34:13,888
Well, fine. Why not?

1967
01:34:13,921 --> 01:34:16,257
I guess
it's as good a time as any.

1968
01:34:16,290 --> 01:34:17,858
It is.

1969
01:34:17,892 --> 01:34:21,028
Maybe a few days ago,
it would've been just words,

1970
01:34:21,061 --> 01:34:22,763
but not today.

1971
01:34:22,796 --> 01:34:25,166
-Mm.
-It's... it's so easy

1972
01:34:25,199 --> 01:34:28,002
to believe in things
when we're young, isn't it?

1973
01:34:28,035 --> 01:34:31,172
And we can do whatever we want,
and everything is possible.

1974
01:34:31,205 --> 01:34:34,475
And then we get older,

1975
01:34:34,509 --> 01:34:38,212
and life starts to silence us.

1976
01:34:38,245 --> 01:34:39,847
-But guess what.
-What?

1977
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:42,082
-The whisper is still there.
-Mm.

1978
01:34:42,116 --> 01:34:45,352
And if you pay
close enough attention,

1979
01:34:45,386 --> 01:34:47,788
-you're gonna hear it.
-Mm.

1980
01:34:47,821 --> 01:34:50,791
In my case,
it was a trip with my friends.

1981
01:34:50,824 --> 01:34:53,194
And I heard it
in the art we saw.

1982
01:34:53,227 --> 01:34:54,495
Remember the art?

1983
01:34:54,529 --> 01:34:56,931
And the moments
that we shared together.

1984
01:34:56,964 --> 01:35:00,734
And the whisper just got
a little bit louder,

1985
01:35:00,768 --> 01:35:03,771
and everything started to feel
a little more possible.

1986
01:35:03,804 --> 01:35:08,075
And now, here I am standing
in front of the man I love,

1987
01:35:08,108 --> 01:35:10,911
surrounded by my best friends
in the world,

1988
01:35:10,945 --> 01:35:15,216
and all I can see
is what's in front of me.

1989
01:35:15,249 --> 01:35:16,483
-Mm.
-So, you want to know

1990
01:35:16,518 --> 01:35:17,918
-what I think, really?
-Yes.

1991
01:35:17,952 --> 01:35:20,921
I think love is reason enough

1992
01:35:20,955 --> 01:35:23,490
and the rest of our lives
start today,

1993
01:35:23,525 --> 01:35:25,226
so what are we waiting for?

1994
01:35:25,259 --> 01:35:26,794
-I'm not waiting.
-Oh, you're not?

1995
01:35:26,827 --> 01:35:28,095
-Okay. Okay.
-I'm here.

1996
01:35:28,128 --> 01:35:30,197
Oh, boy. I'm not sure
how you follow that.

1997
01:35:30,231 --> 01:35:32,933
You don't follow that.
You just ride alongside of it.

1998
01:35:32,967 --> 01:35:35,836
And you thank your lucky stars
every day that you do.

1999
01:35:36,904 --> 01:35:40,040
Diane, I've never...
I've never been married before

2000
01:35:40,074 --> 01:35:43,444
because I never found someone
that made me see

2001
01:35:43,477 --> 01:35:46,313
the reason why I should.

2002
01:35:48,315 --> 01:35:50,251
Don't you dare move.

2003
01:35:50,284 --> 01:35:52,253
Oh. What?

2004
01:35:52,286 --> 01:35:53,555
Don't...

2005
01:35:53,588 --> 01:35:56,123
Arthur, the ring.
I need the ring.

2006
01:35:56,156 --> 01:35:58,025
I don't...

2007
01:35:59,026 --> 01:35:59,994
Congratulations.

2008
01:36:00,027 --> 01:36:01,829
Uh-huh.
-Thank you.

2009
01:36:05,266 --> 01:36:07,034
Oh, no.

2010
01:36:07,067 --> 01:36:08,869
Oh, no.

2011
01:36:08,902 --> 01:36:10,538
-I can't believe it.
-Diane...

2012
01:36:10,572 --> 01:36:12,940
Okay, yes. Oh, my God.

2013
01:36:12,973 --> 01:36:14,808
Yes. Yes.

2014
01:36:14,842 --> 01:36:16,443
You're my reason.

2015
01:36:16,477 --> 01:36:18,145
Will you marry me?

2016
01:36:19,179 --> 01:36:21,415
And I promise I'm not asking
because I'm pregnant.

2017
01:36:21,448 --> 01:36:23,217
Yes.

2018
01:36:23,250 --> 01:36:24,885
Hell yes, I'll marry you.

2019
01:36:24,918 --> 01:36:26,353
I'll marry you right now.

2020
01:36:31,392 --> 01:36:33,294
-Oh, my God.
-Bruce.

2021
01:36:34,928 --> 01:36:36,864
Congratulations.

2022
01:36:36,897 --> 01:36:39,066
-Di!
-Well, this is fun.

2023
01:36:39,099 --> 01:36:41,869
-Yes.
-Diane, you crazy person.

2024
01:36:41,902 --> 01:36:46,040
Do you take Mitchell to be
your lawfully wedded husband,

2025
01:36:46,073 --> 01:36:49,343
to love and cherish you
from this day forward?

2026
01:36:49,376 --> 01:36:50,944
Yes.

2027
01:36:50,978 --> 01:36:53,981
You're supposed to say, "I do."

2028
01:36:54,014 --> 01:36:55,382
Oh, okay.

2029
01:36:55,416 --> 01:36:57,451
I... I say...

2030
01:36:57,484 --> 01:36:59,386
yes, I do.

2031
01:36:59,420 --> 01:37:01,055
I'll take it.

2032
01:37:01,088 --> 01:37:02,990
I'm sorry.

2033
01:37:03,023 --> 01:37:08,062
And, Mitchell, do you take Diane
and all her delightful insanity

2034
01:37:08,095 --> 01:37:10,364
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

2035
01:37:11,533 --> 01:37:14,602
I do, and I can't wait.

2036
01:37:14,636 --> 01:37:17,204
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

2037
01:37:17,237 --> 01:37:18,506
You may kiss the bride.

2038
01:37:18,540 --> 01:37:19,973
Nobody waits for my cue.

2039
01:37:28,415 --> 01:37:30,250
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

2040
01:37:35,690 --> 01:37:37,858
Hey, Chief.

2041
01:37:50,304 --> 01:37:52,906
<i>How does a woman in her 70s</i>

2042
01:37:52,940 --> 01:37:55,242
<i>end up getting married?</i>

2043
01:37:55,275 --> 01:37:58,112
<i>In Italy, no less.</i>

2044
01:37:58,145 --> 01:38:01,382
<i>She takes control</i>
<i>of her own destiny.</i>

2045
01:38:03,651 --> 01:38:05,520
Gosh.

2046
01:38:05,553 --> 01:38:07,988
I love you. Love you.

2047
01:38:09,423 --> 01:38:11,425
What's she doing?

2048
01:38:14,495 --> 01:38:16,497
Okay, run.

2049
01:38:16,531 --> 01:38:18,999
No, actually, let's walk fast.

2050
01:38:21,703 --> 01:38:23,971
What-what are you...

2051
01:38:24,004 --> 01:38:26,240
What are you doing?

2052
01:38:26,273 --> 01:38:29,943
So... So, I'm gonna do
this honeymoon thing,

2053
01:38:29,977 --> 01:38:32,146
but I just wanted to ask,

2054
01:38:32,179 --> 01:38:34,314
well, what are we doing next?

2055
01:38:35,650 --> 01:38:38,586
I don't know, but I know
one thing for sure--

2056
01:38:38,620 --> 01:38:41,221
we're not gonna
leave it up to fate.

2057
01:38:41,255 --> 01:38:43,290
-Right!
-Aw.

2058
01:38:49,129 --> 01:38:51,900
I love you guys!
