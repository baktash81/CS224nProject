1
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:08,057
Christmas comes but once a year

2
00:01:08,129 --> 00:01:12,395
For every girl and boy

3
00:01:12,466 --> 00:01:16,732
The laughter and the joy

4
00:01:16,804 --> 00:01:21,241
They find in each new toy

5
00:01:21,308 --> 00:01:25,745
I'll tell you of a little boy

6
00:01:25,813 --> 00:01:30,250
Who lives across the way

7
00:01:30,317 --> 00:01:34,651
This little fella's Christmas

8
00:01:34,722 --> 00:01:39,056
ls just another day

9
00:03:09,483 --> 00:03:12,543
lt was just before dawn

10
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:15,248
One miserable morning

11
00:03:15,322 --> 00:03:17,313
ln black '44

12
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:24,989
When the forward commander
was told to sit tight

13
00:03:25,065 --> 00:03:28,967
When he asked that
his men be withdrawn

14
00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:34,937
And the generals gave thanks

15
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:36,943
As the other ranks

16
00:03:37,011 --> 00:03:40,469
Held back the enemy tanks

17
00:03:40,547 --> 00:03:42,481
For a while

18
00:03:42,549 --> 00:03:45,074
And the Anzio bridgehead

19
00:03:45,152 --> 00:03:47,677
Was held for the price

20
00:03:47,755 --> 00:03:50,918
Of a few hundred ordinary lives

21
00:04:17,084 --> 00:04:19,575
He's the little boy

22
00:04:19,653 --> 00:04:26,582
That Santa Claus forgot

23
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,924
And Goodness knows

24
00:04:28,996 --> 00:04:34,161
He didn 't want a lot

25
00:04:35,836 --> 00:04:39,602
He sent a note to Santa

26
00:04:39,673 --> 00:04:44,610
For some soldiers and a drum

27
00:04:44,678 --> 00:04:48,239
lt broke his little heart

28
00:04:48,315 --> 00:04:52,911
When he found Santa hadn't come

29
00:04:53,687 --> 00:04:56,212
ln the street he envies

30
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:00,454
All those lucky boys

31
00:07:29,176 --> 00:07:31,542
So ya thought ya

32
00:07:31,612 --> 00:07:33,546
Might like to

33
00:07:33,614 --> 00:07:35,548
Go to the show

34
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:42,855
To feel the warm thrill
of confusion

35
00:07:42,923 --> 00:07:46,120
That space cadet glow

36
00:07:47,761 --> 00:07:52,630
Tell me, is something
eluding you, sunshine

37
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:57,033
ls this not what
you expected to see

38
00:07:57,104 --> 00:08:01,905
lf you wanna find out
what's behind these cold eyes

39
00:08:01,975 --> 00:08:07,140
You'll just have to
claw your way through this disguise

40
00:10:34,461 --> 00:10:37,089
Mama loves her baby

41
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:42,727
And Daddy loves you too

42
00:10:44,971 --> 00:10:49,169
And the sea may look
warm to you, babe

43
00:10:50,711 --> 00:10:53,805
And the sky may look blue

44
00:10:55,415 --> 00:10:59,476
Ooh, ooh, ooh

45
00:10:59,553 --> 00:11:01,646
Ooh. babe

46
00:11:06,126 --> 00:11:10,187
Ooh, ooh, ooh

47
00:11:10,263 --> 00:11:13,426
Baby blue

48
00:11:17,104 --> 00:11:22,440
Ooh, ooh, ooh

49
00:11:22,509 --> 00:11:26,605
Ooh, ooh, babe

50
00:11:29,282 --> 00:11:33,013
lf you should go skating

51
00:11:33,086 --> 00:11:36,112
On the thin ice of modern life

52
00:11:39,025 --> 00:11:41,425
Dragging behind you

53
00:11:41,495 --> 00:11:43,929
The silent reproach

54
00:11:43,997 --> 00:11:48,229
Of a million tear-stained eyes

55
00:11:49,903 --> 00:11:51,894
Don 't be surprised

56
00:11:51,972 --> 00:11:55,169
When a crack in the ice

57
00:11:55,242 --> 00:11:58,769
Appears under your feet

58
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:05,675
You slip out of your depth
and out of your mind

59
00:12:05,752 --> 00:12:09,586
With you fear
flowing out behind you

60
00:12:09,656 --> 00:12:12,216
As you claw the thin ice

61
00:13:11,151 --> 00:13:16,248
Daddy's flown across the ocean

62
00:13:20,927 --> 00:13:25,557
Leaving just a memory

63
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:35,069
A snapshot in the family album

64
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:46,112
Daddy, what else
did you leave for me

65
00:13:52,626 --> 00:13:55,891
Daddy, what'd ya leave behind for me

66
00:14:00,533 --> 00:14:02,728
All in all it was

67
00:14:02,802 --> 00:14:05,862
Just a brick in the wall

68
00:14:10,377 --> 00:14:15,474
All in all it was all
just bricks in the wall

69
00:14:38,371 --> 00:14:40,236
Easy. Be careful.

70
00:14:51,418 --> 00:14:53,545
- What?
- Will you put me on there?

71
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:56,589
- Well, where's your mother, then?
- She's gone to the shops.

72
00:14:56,656 --> 00:14:58,681
Yes, all right.

73
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,354
How's that then? Enjoying it?

74
00:15:09,602 --> 00:15:10,728
Lovely, lovely.

75
00:15:21,381 --> 00:15:24,612
Now off you go.
Go on.

76
00:15:26,586 --> 00:15:28,645
Now what have l told you about this?
What have l told you?

77
00:15:28,722 --> 00:15:32,590
Go on, go on now. Sling your hook.
Go on. Sling your hook.

78
00:17:33,847 --> 00:17:36,281
And kind old King George

79
00:17:36,349 --> 00:17:39,216
Sent Mother a note

80
00:17:39,285 --> 00:17:42,015
When he heard that Father was gone

81
00:17:44,858 --> 00:17:47,418
lt was. l recall

82
00:17:47,494 --> 00:17:50,554
ln the form of a scroll

83
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,757
Gold leaf and all

84
00:17:55,768 --> 00:17:58,737
And l found it one day

85
00:17:58,805 --> 00:18:02,104
ln a drawer of old photographs

86
00:18:02,175 --> 00:18:04,109
Hidden away

87
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:10,138
And my eyes still grow damp
to remember

88
00:18:10,216 --> 00:18:13,083
His Majesty signed

89
00:18:13,153 --> 00:18:15,917
With his own rubber stamp

90
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:21,253
lt was dark all around

91
00:18:21,327 --> 00:18:23,818
There was frost in the ground

92
00:18:23,897 --> 00:18:27,060
When the tigers broke free

93
00:18:30,136 --> 00:18:32,604
And no one survived

94
00:18:32,672 --> 00:18:37,939
From the Royal Fusiliers Company C

95
00:18:41,047 --> 00:18:44,312
They were all left behind

96
00:18:44,384 --> 00:18:47,080
Most of them dead

97
00:18:47,153 --> 00:18:51,146
The rest of them dying

98
00:18:52,725 --> 00:18:56,252
And that's how the high command

99
00:18:56,329 --> 00:19:00,095
Took my daddy from me

100
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:05,297
Did you see the frightened ones

101
00:20:05,365 --> 00:20:09,597
Did you hear the falling bombs

102
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:14,265
Did you ever wonder why
we had to run for shelter

103
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:19,972
When the promise of a brave new world
unfurled beneath the clear blue sky

104
00:20:36,195 --> 00:20:40,393
Did you see the frightened ones

105
00:20:40,466 --> 00:20:44,903
Did you hear the falling bombs

106
00:20:44,971 --> 00:20:50,068
The flames are all long gone
but the pain lingers on

107
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,705
Good-bye

108
00:20:55,782 --> 00:20:58,250
Blue sky

109
00:20:58,318 --> 00:21:01,776
Good-bye, blue sky

110
00:21:01,854 --> 00:21:03,788
Good-bye

111
00:21:06,292 --> 00:21:08,226
Good-bye

112
00:21:14,734 --> 00:21:17,931
Wait for me, Pinky,
you rotten bleeder.

113
00:21:18,004 --> 00:21:20,939
- They're my bullets, ain't they?
- I don't know.

114
00:21:21,007 --> 00:21:24,374
Come on, Tubs.
It's great down in the tunnel.

115
00:21:24,444 --> 00:21:26,810
Don't you think
it'd be dangerous, Pinky?

116
00:21:26,879 --> 00:21:28,676
No. Don't be daft.

117
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,920
- You all right, Tubs?
- Yeah. Hurt me knee a bit.

118
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,631
- Come on.
- Na. lt's too dangerous.

119
00:21:52,705 --> 00:21:55,640
- We'll wait for the train.
- Give me the torch.

120
00:22:05,752 --> 00:22:08,277
Pinky! Here comes the train !

121
00:22:08,354 --> 00:22:10,845
Get off the line,
you bloody idiot! Here it comes!

122
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:16,722
Pinky, get off the line!
Here it comes!

123
00:22:17,997 --> 00:22:18,929
Pinky, get off the line!

124
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:38,382
You !

125
00:22:41,354 --> 00:22:44,881
You! Yes, you !

126
00:22:44,957 --> 00:22:46,788
Stand stilI, laddie!

127
00:23:09,882 --> 00:23:12,749
When we grew up and went to school

128
00:23:12,819 --> 00:23:18,314
There were certain teachers who would
hurt the children anyway they could

129
00:23:21,794 --> 00:23:26,288
By pouring their derision
upon anything we did

130
00:23:26,365 --> 00:23:28,663
Exposing every weakness

131
00:23:28,734 --> 00:23:32,431
However carefully hidden
by the kids

132
00:23:32,505 --> 00:23:34,939
What have we here, laddie?

133
00:23:35,007 --> 00:23:38,238
Mysterious scribblings?
A secret code?

134
00:23:39,445 --> 00:23:41,811
No. Poems, no less.

135
00:23:41,881 --> 00:23:44,042
Poems, everybody!

136
00:23:44,116 --> 00:23:46,277
The lad here reckons himself
a poet.

137
00:23:47,587 --> 00:23:50,522
''Money, get back.
l'm all right, Jack.

138
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:53,787
Keep your hands
off my stack.

139
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:57,125
New car, caviar,
four-star daydream.

140
00:23:57,196 --> 00:24:00,359
Think I'll buy me
a football team.''

141
00:24:00,433 --> 00:24:03,027
Absolute rubbish, laddie!

142
00:24:03,102 --> 00:24:06,401
Get on with your work.

143
00:24:06,472 --> 00:24:08,099
Repeat after me:

144
00:24:08,174 --> 00:24:11,371
An acre is the area
of a rectangle...

145
00:24:11,444 --> 00:24:13,742
whose length is one furlong...

146
00:24:13,813 --> 00:24:16,543
and whose width is one chain.

147
00:24:16,616 --> 00:24:18,880
But in this town it was well known

148
00:24:18,951 --> 00:24:23,285
When they got home at night
their fat and psychopathic wives

149
00:24:23,356 --> 00:24:26,655
Would thrash them
within inches of their lives

150
00:24:45,211 --> 00:24:49,944
We don 't need no education

151
00:24:54,654 --> 00:24:59,148
We don't need no thought control

152
00:25:03,563 --> 00:25:08,398
No dark sarcasm in the classroom

153
00:25:12,872 --> 00:25:16,808
Teacher. leave them kids alone

154
00:25:23,549 --> 00:25:27,883
Hey, teacher, leave them kids alone

155
00:25:32,191 --> 00:25:37,288
All in all it's just
another brick in the wall

156
00:25:38,898 --> 00:25:41,059
Wrong! Do it again !

157
00:25:41,133 --> 00:25:46,799
All in all you're just
another brick in the wall

158
00:25:50,376 --> 00:25:54,642
We don 't need no education

159
00:25:54,714 --> 00:25:57,649
lf you don't eat your meat,
you can't have any pudding!

160
00:25:57,717 --> 00:26:00,982
We don't need no thought control

161
00:26:01,053 --> 00:26:03,851
How can you have any pudding
if you don't eat your meat?

162
00:26:03,923 --> 00:26:07,154
No dark sarcasm in the classroom

163
00:26:07,226 --> 00:26:09,820
You ! Yes, you, laddie!

164
00:26:09,895 --> 00:26:13,160
Poems, everybody.
The lad here reckons himself a poet.

165
00:26:13,232 --> 00:26:17,532
Teachers, leave them kids alone

166
00:26:23,609 --> 00:26:27,238
Hey, teacher, leave those kids alone

167
00:26:32,451 --> 00:26:37,411
All in all you're just
another brick in the wall

168
00:26:41,661 --> 00:26:46,098
All in all you're just
another brick in the wall

169
00:27:32,311 --> 00:27:36,509
We don 't need no education

170
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:55,858
No dark sarcasm in the classroom

171
00:28:00,272 --> 00:28:04,675
Again. An acre is the area
of a rectangle...

172
00:28:04,744 --> 00:28:07,008
whose length is one furlong...

173
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:09,843
and whose width is one chain.

174
00:29:02,735 --> 00:29:05,533
Mother, do you think
they'll drop the bomb

175
00:29:18,651 --> 00:29:21,814
Mother, do you think
they'll like the song

176
00:29:35,501 --> 00:29:40,063
Mother, do you think
they'll try to break my balls

177
00:29:50,516 --> 00:29:52,984
Mother, should l build the wall

178
00:30:20,713 --> 00:30:23,580
Mother, should l run for president

179
00:30:37,029 --> 00:30:40,294
Mother, should l trust the government

180
00:30:53,913 --> 00:30:58,441
Mother, will they put me
in the firing line

181
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:12,052
Mother, am l really dying

182
00:31:17,736 --> 00:31:22,002
Hush now, baby, baby
don't you cry

183
00:31:26,478 --> 00:31:32,041
Mama 's gonna make all of
your nightmares come true

184
00:31:32,117 --> 00:31:37,316
Mama 's gonna put

Love turns grey

281
00:45:40,465 --> 00:45:44,060
Like the skin of a dying man

282
00:45:47,605 --> 00:45:50,438
And night after night

283
00:45:50,508 --> 00:45:54,137
We pretend it's all right

284

Cold as a razor blade

292
00:46:30,949 --> 00:46:34,248
Tight as a tourniquet

293
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:38,278
Dry as a funeral drum

294
00:46:42,694 --> 00:46:44,628
Run to the bedroom

295
00:46:44,696 --> 00:46:49,793
ln the suitcase on the left

296
00:46:53,504 --> 00:46:57,941
Don 't look so frightened
This is just a passing phase

297
00:46:58,009 --> 00:47:01,137
One of my bad days

298

299
00:47:07,051 --> 00:47:12,614

Or contemplate the silent freeway

301
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:18,193

On the telephone to you

And the inevitable pinhole burns

All down the front

And l got a strong urge to fly

But l got nowhere to fly to

361
01:00:19,543 --> 01:00:24,537
Oooh, babe

And l got fading roots

366

Does anybody here

Remember how she said

368
01:03:31,034 --> 01:03:34,629
That we would meet again

369
01:03:34,705 --> 01:03:38,163
Some sunny day

370
01:04:02,399 --> 01:04:04,663
Vera

371
01:04:04,735 --> 01:04:07,966
Vera

372
01:04:09,573 --> 01:04:12,838
What has become of you

373
01:04:17,714 --> 01:04:21,377
Does anybody else in here

374
01:04:21,451 --> 01:04:23,715
Feel the way l do

375
01:04:45,042 --> 01:04:49,172
Bring the boys back home

376
01:04:54,017 --> 01:04:58,477
Bring the boys back home

377
01:05:02,659 --> 01:05:05,787
Don 't leave the children

378
01:05:05,862 --> 01:05:10,390
On their own, no, no

379
01:05:14,638 --> 01:05:19,371
Bring the boys back home

380
01:05:24,014 --> 01:05:28,348
Bring the boys back home

381
01:05:32,923 --> 01:05:35,756
Don 't leave the children

382
01:05:35,826 --> 01:05:40,286
On their own, no, no

383
01:05:44,768 --> 01:05:48,226
Bring the boys back home

384
01:05:51,842 --> 01:05:55,403
Wrong! Do it again!

385
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:05,782
- You feeling okay?

386
01:06:15,098 --> 01:06:18,534
ls there anybody out there

387
01:06:18,602 --> 01:06:20,797
- Fuck me.

388
01:06:20,871 --> 01:06:24,102
He's gone compIetely around
the bleedin' twist.

389
01:06:24,174 --> 01:06:27,075
You vicious bastard.
you never did like me, did you?

390
01:06:28,478 --> 01:06:30,708
Hello

391
01:06:30,781 --> 01:06:33,272
ls there anybody in there

392
01:06:34,851 --> 01:06:39,311
Just nod if you can hear me

393
01:06:39,389 --> 01:06:41,653
ls there anyone at home

394
01:06:43,593 --> 01:06:46,824
Come on, now

395
01:06:46,897 --> 01:06:51,129
l hear you're feeling down

396
01:06:51,201 --> 01:06:53,999
Well, l can ease your pain

397
01:06:54,071 --> 01:06:58,599
- And get you on your feet again
- The boy's an asthmatic.

398
01:06:58,675 --> 01:07:01,644
- Asthmatic!?
- Relax

399
01:07:01,711 --> 01:07:06,205
- l'll need some information first
- He's an artist!

400
01:07:06,283 --> 01:07:09,616
Just the basic facts

401
01:07:09,686 --> 01:07:13,986
Can you show me where it hurts

402
01:07:14,057 --> 01:07:18,926
There is no pain
you are receding

403
01:07:22,032 --> 01:07:26,401
A distant ship smoke
on the horizon

404
01:07:29,473 --> 01:07:33,933
You are only coming through in waves

405
01:07:36,513 --> 01:07:38,447
Your lips move

406
01:07:38,515 --> 01:07:41,382
But l can't hear what you're saying

407
01:07:44,154 --> 01:07:47,055
When l was a child

408
01:07:47,124 --> 01:07:49,456
l had a fever

409
01:07:51,661 --> 01:07:57,531
My hands felt just like two balloons

410
01:07:59,569 --> 01:08:04,165
Now l've got that feeling once again

411
01:08:04,241 --> 01:08:08,371
l can 't explain
you would not understand

412
01:08:08,445 --> 01:08:12,006
This is not how l am

413
01:08:14,784 --> 01:08:19,414
l

414
01:08:19,489 --> 01:08:22,925
Have become comfortably numb

415
01:08:56,393 --> 01:09:01,387
l

416
01:09:01,464 --> 01:09:04,262
Have become comfortably numb

417
01:09:08,004 --> 01:09:10,495
Okay

418
01:09:10,574 --> 01:09:12,838
Just a little pinprick

419
01:09:14,444 --> 01:09:18,346
There'll be no more
Aaaaah

420
01:09:18,415 --> 01:09:21,179
But you may feel a little sick

421
01:09:22,452 --> 01:09:25,683
Can you stand up

422
01:09:25,755 --> 01:09:28,189
l do believe it's working

423
01:09:28,258 --> 01:09:29,486
- Good
- He's coming around.

424
01:09:29,559 --> 01:09:34,496
-That'll keep you going through the show
-There, you see?

425
01:09:34,564 --> 01:09:38,159
- Come on, it's time to go
- How do you feel?

426
01:09:38,235 --> 01:09:43,332
There is no pain
you are receding

427
01:09:46,209 --> 01:09:50,509
A distant ship smoke
on the horizon

428
01:09:53,550 --> 01:09:57,850
You are only coming through in waves

429
01:10:00,624 --> 01:10:02,558
Your lips move

430
01:10:02,626 --> 01:10:05,595
But l can't hear what you're saying

431
01:10:08,231 --> 01:10:11,200
When l was a child

432
01:10:11,268 --> 01:10:13,998
l caught a fleeting glimpse

433
01:10:16,539 --> 01:10:20,873
Out of the corner of my eye

434
01:10:23,913 --> 01:10:27,906
l turned to look
but it was gone

435
01:10:27,984 --> 01:10:32,717
l cannot put my finger on it now

436
01:10:32,789 --> 01:10:36,919
The child is grown
The dream is gone

437
01:10:38,862 --> 01:10:43,492
l

438
01:10:43,566 --> 01:10:48,162
Have become comfortably numb

439
01:14:25,355 --> 01:14:28,381
So ya thought ya

440
01:14:28,458 --> 01:14:31,484
Might like to go to the show

441
01:14:35,031 --> 01:14:38,728
To feel the warm thrill
of confusion

442
01:14:38,801 --> 01:14:41,668
That space cadet glow

443
01:14:44,874 --> 01:14:49,243
l got some bad news for you, sunshine

444
01:14:49,312 --> 01:14:53,339
Pink isn 't well
He's, uh, back at the hotel

445
01:14:53,416 --> 01:14:56,476
And they sent us along
as a surrogate band

446
01:14:56,553 --> 01:15:00,956
Now tonight, we 're gonna find out
where you fans really stand

447
01:15:04,193 --> 01:15:06,923
Are there any queers
in the audience tonight

448
01:15:08,898 --> 01:15:13,198
- Get 'em up against the wall
- Against the wall

449
01:15:13,269 --> 01:15:16,466
There's one in the spotlight
he don 't look right

450
01:15:18,708 --> 01:15:23,236
- Have him up against the wall
- Against the wall

451
01:15:23,313 --> 01:15:27,682
And that one looks Jewish
And that one's a coon

452
01:15:27,750 --> 01:15:31,311
Who let all this riffraff
into the room

453
01:15:31,387 --> 01:15:33,548
There's one smoking a joint

454
01:15:33,623 --> 01:15:37,787
And that one's got spots

455
01:15:37,860 --> 01:15:41,990
lf l had my way
l'd have all of you shot

456
01:17:13,156 --> 01:17:16,819
Run, run, run, run

457
01:17:16,893 --> 01:17:21,227
Run, run, run, run

458
01:17:21,297 --> 01:17:25,495
Run, run, run, run

459
01:17:25,568 --> 01:17:28,969
Run, run, run, run

460
01:17:29,038 --> 01:17:33,099
You better make your face up
in your favorite disguise

461
01:17:33,176 --> 01:17:37,636
With your button-down lips
and your roller-blind eyes

462
01:17:37,714 --> 01:17:41,775
With your empty smile
and your hungry heart

463
01:17:41,851 --> 01:17:45,685
Feel the bile rising
from your guilty past

464
01:17:45,755 --> 01:17:49,885
With your nerves in tatters
as the cockleshell shatters

465
01:17:49,959 --> 01:17:53,725
And the hammers batter down your door

466
01:17:53,796 --> 01:17:58,529
You better run
run, run, run

467
01:17:58,601 --> 01:18:02,628
Run, run, run, run

468
01:18:02,705 --> 01:18:06,732
Run, run, run, run

469
01:18:06,809 --> 01:18:10,267
Run, run, run, run

470
01:18:10,346 --> 01:18:14,339
You better run all day
and run all night

471
01:18:14,417 --> 01:18:18,376
Keep your dirty feelings deep inside

472
01:18:18,454 --> 01:18:22,481
And if you're taking
your girlfriend out tonight

473
01:18:22,558 --> 01:18:26,892
You'd better park the car
well out of sight

474
01:18:26,963 --> 01:18:30,831
'Cause if they catch you in
the back seat trying to pick her locks

475
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:34,893
They're gonna send you back to Mother
in a cardboard box

476
01:18:34,971 --> 01:18:36,905
You better run

477
01:19:08,905 --> 01:19:11,237
You cannot reach me now

478
01:19:15,311 --> 01:19:19,179
No matter how you try

479
01:19:20,483 --> 01:19:23,384
Good-bye, cruel world

480
01:19:23,452 --> 01:19:25,943
lt's over

481
01:19:26,022 --> 01:19:27,922
Walk on by

482
01:19:32,328 --> 01:19:34,296
Waiting

483
01:19:34,363 --> 01:19:37,457
- To cut out the dead wood
- Waiting

484
01:19:37,533 --> 01:19:40,866
- To weed out the weaklings
- Waiting

485
01:19:40,937 --> 01:19:44,600
To smash in their windows
and kick in their doors

486
01:19:44,674 --> 01:19:49,111
- Waiting
- For the final solution
to strengthen the strain

487
01:19:49,178 --> 01:19:52,875
- Waiting
- To follow the worms

488
01:19:56,152 --> 01:19:59,451
- Would you like to see
- Would you like to see

489
01:19:59,522 --> 01:20:02,889
Britannia rule again

490
01:20:05,127 --> 01:20:06,458
My friend

491
01:20:09,232 --> 01:20:14,169
All you need to do
is follow the worms

492
01:20:57,480 --> 01:21:00,506
Hammer! Hammer!

493
01:21:00,583 --> 01:21:03,950
Hammer! Hammer!

494
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:06,887
Hammer! Hammer!

495
01:21:06,956 --> 01:21:10,119
Hammer! Hammer!

496
01:21:10,192 --> 01:21:13,252
Hammer! Hammer!

497
01:21:13,329 --> 01:21:16,696
Hammer! Hammer!

498
01:21:16,766 --> 01:21:19,894
Hammer! Hammer!

499
01:21:19,969 --> 01:21:24,702
Hammer! Hammer! Hammer!

500
01:21:24,774 --> 01:21:27,675
Stop!

501
01:23:18,421 --> 01:23:20,082
Stop.

502
01:23:26,362 --> 01:23:28,296
l wanna go home

503
01:23:32,234 --> 01:23:37,194
Take off this uniform
and leave the show

504
01:23:39,842 --> 01:23:43,972
But l'm waiting in this cell

505
01:23:44,046 --> 01:23:47,277
Because l have to know

506
01:23:48,818 --> 01:23:52,254
Have l been

507
01:23:52,321 --> 01:23:57,759
Have l been guilty all this time

508
01:24:48,477 --> 01:24:51,412
Good morning, Worm, Your Honor

509
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:53,846
The crown will plainly show

510
01:24:53,916 --> 01:24:57,716
The prisoner who now stands before you

511
01:24:57,786 --> 01:25:02,655
Was caught red-handed showing feelings

512
01:25:02,725 --> 01:25:08,254
Showing feelings
of an almost human nature

513
01:25:08,330 --> 01:25:12,096
This will not do

514
01:25:12,168 --> 01:25:14,398
Call the schoolmaster

515
01:25:14,470 --> 01:25:17,439
l always said he'd come to no good

516
01:25:17,506 --> 01:25:19,974
ln the end. Your Honor

517
01:25:20,042 --> 01:25:22,476
lf they'd let me have my way

518
01:25:22,545 --> 01:25:26,811
l could have flayed him into shape

519
01:25:26,882 --> 01:25:29,783
But my hands were tied

520
01:25:29,852 --> 01:25:32,252
The bleeding hearts and artists

521
01:25:32,321 --> 01:25:35,722
Let him get away with murder

522
01:25:35,791 --> 01:25:38,919
Let me hammer him today

523
01:25:41,330 --> 01:25:44,697
Crazy

524
01:25:44,767 --> 01:25:50,797
Toys in the attic
l am crazy

525
01:25:50,873 --> 01:25:54,036
Truly gone fishing

526
01:25:57,913 --> 01:26:03,818
They must have taken my marbles away

527
01:26:03,886 --> 01:26:07,253
Crazy

528
01:26:07,323 --> 01:26:13,592
Toys in the attic
He is crazy

529
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:21,092
You little shit
You're in it now

530
01:26:21,170 --> 01:26:24,401
l hope they throw away the key

531
01:26:24,473 --> 01:26:28,739
You should've talked to me
more often than you did

532
01:26:28,811 --> 01:26:32,474
But no
You had to go your own way

533
01:26:32,548 --> 01:26:35,984
Have you broken
any homes up lately

534
01:26:36,051 --> 01:26:39,316
Just five minutes. Worm. Your Honor

535
01:26:39,388 --> 01:26:42,323
Him and me alone

536
01:26:43,892 --> 01:26:50,024
Babe

537
01:26:50,099 --> 01:26:52,329
Come to Mother, baby

538
01:26:52,401 --> 01:26:56,167
Let me hold you in my arms

539
01:26:56,238 --> 01:27:01,733
M'lud, l never wanted him
to get in any trouble

540
01:27:01,810 --> 01:27:05,041
Why'd he ever have to leave me

541
01:27:05,114 --> 01:27:09,141
Worm. Your Honor
let me take him home

542
01:27:10,819 --> 01:27:13,947
Crazy

543
01:27:14,023 --> 01:27:20,428
Over the rainbow
l'm crazy

544
01:27:20,496 --> 01:27:23,863
Bars in the window

545
01:27:26,702 --> 01:27:31,799
There must have been a door there
in the wall

546
01:27:31,874 --> 01:27:36,743
- When l came in
- Crazy

547
01:27:36,812 --> 01:27:42,910
Over the rainbow
He is crazy

548
01:27:46,822 --> 01:27:53,022
The evidence before the court
is incontrovertible

549
01:27:53,095 --> 01:27:57,191
There 's no need
for the jury to retire

550
01:27:59,435 --> 01:28:02,063
ln all my years of judging

551
01:28:02,137 --> 01:28:05,368
l have never heard before

552
01:28:05,441 --> 01:28:08,035
Of someone more deserving

553
01:28:08,110 --> 01:28:12,069
The full penalty of law

554
01:28:12,147 --> 01:28:14,581
The way you made them suffer

555
01:28:14,650 --> 01:28:18,347
Your exquisite wife and mother

556
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:21,821
Fills me with the urge to defecate

557
01:28:24,626 --> 01:28:30,326
Since, my friend
you have revealed your deepest fear

558
01:28:30,399 --> 01:28:34,199
l sentence you to be exposed

559
01:28:34,269 --> 01:28:37,295
Before your peers

560
01:28:37,373 --> 01:28:40,501
Tear down the wall

561
01:28:40,576 --> 01:28:43,807
Tear down the wall

562
01:28:43,879 --> 01:28:46,643
Tear down the wall

563
01:28:46,715 --> 01:28:49,616
Tear down the wall

564
01:28:49,685 --> 01:28:52,677
Tear down the wall

565
01:28:52,755 --> 01:28:56,316
Tear down the wall

566
01:28:56,392 --> 01:28:59,259
Tear down the wall

567
01:28:59,328 --> 01:29:02,126
Tear down the wall

568
01:29:02,197 --> 01:29:05,792
Tear down the wall

569
01:29:05,868 --> 01:29:08,496
Tear down the wall

570
01:29:08,570 --> 01:29:11,937
Tear down the wall

571
01:29:12,007 --> 01:29:14,771
Tear down the wall

572
01:29:14,843 --> 01:29:17,710
Tear down the wall

573
01:29:17,780 --> 01:29:21,181
Tear down the wall

574
01:29:21,250 --> 01:29:24,048
Tear down the wall

575
01:29:24,119 --> 01:29:27,145
Tear down the wall

576
01:31:46,428 --> 01:31:48,896
All alone

577
01:31:48,964 --> 01:31:50,898
Or in two's

578
01:31:52,668 --> 01:31:56,729
The ones who really love you

579
01:32:00,709 --> 01:32:03,644
Walk up and down

580
01:32:03,712 --> 01:32:05,646
Outside the wall

581
01:32:11,453 --> 01:32:15,389
Some hand in hand

582
01:32:17,326 --> 01:32:21,626
Some gathered together in bands

583
01:32:24,166 --> 01:32:29,433
The bleeding hearts
and the artists

584
01:32:29,504 --> 01:32:31,472
Make their stand

585
01:32:35,243 --> 01:32:40,647
And when they've given you their all

586
01:32:40,716 --> 01:32:43,549
Some stagger and fall

587
01:32:43,619 --> 01:32:47,055
After all, it's not easy

588
01:32:49,324 --> 01:32:51,815
Banging your heart

589
01:32:51,893 --> 01:32:56,455
Against some mad bugger's wall

590
01:34:14,676 --> 01:34:19,841
When they've given you their all

591
01:34:19,915 --> 01:34:22,543
Some stagger and fall

592
01:34:22,617 --> 01:34:25,984
After all, it's not easy
