00:01:35,617 --> 00:01:39,158
Maintain the line!
All the way to the ridge!

3
00:01:41,742 --> 00:01:43,033
Hold the line!

4
00:01:43,117 --> 00:01:45,575
The wind is turning!

5
00:01:45,658 --> 00:01:47,950
- We got no escape route!
- We know, get the gear!

6
00:01:48,033 --> 00:01:49,325
Leo, get back here!

7
00:01:51,908 --> 00:01:54,075
- Come on!
- Leo!

8
00:01:54,158 --> 00:01:55,658
Fire's turned!

9
00:01:58,908 --> 00:02:01,200
- Fall back!
- Help us, please!

10
00:02:24,283 --> 00:02:25,700
Morning, ma'am.

11
00:02:25,783 --> 00:02:28,033
I'm with the Fire Department,
he's with Florida Gas.

12
00:02:28,117 --> 00:02:31,283
Yeah, our system alerted us to a gas leak
where our main feeds into your boiler.

13
00:02:31,367 --> 00:02:32,867
Is your husband home?

14
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,742
He's in the shower.
Should we get out of the house?

15
00:02:34,825 --> 00:02:38,408
No, this is as likely a computer
error as an actual leak, but...

16
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,367
we should check to be safe.

17
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,825
- May we come in?
- Please, yes.

18
00:02:42,908 --> 00:02:45,658
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Yeah, thank you.

19
00:03:03,117 --> 00:03:05,367
Hey, how far away
is Jacksonville?

20
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:08,617
With traffic? Six hours.

21
00:03:09,575 --> 00:03:11,075
Maybe more.

22
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:15,033
You got blood on your shirt.

23
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:18,158
You should change
before we continue.

24
00:03:18,242 --> 00:03:20,908
Well I'd hate to take a detour.
This'll be on the news in a half hour.

25
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:23,033
If he has any sense he'll
be on the move already.

26
00:03:23,117 --> 00:03:27,033
Uh, it'll take him a day to get
the courage, another to plan it.

27
00:03:27,117 --> 00:03:30,658
We'll be there, besides.
We don't take unnecessary risks.

28
00:03:32,325 --> 00:03:34,992
- I'm sorry.
- Happens.

29
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,450
Come on, bud.
We're gonna be late.

30
00:03:51,533 --> 00:03:54,075
<i>...light
winds out of the southwest.</i>

31
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:57,158
<i>Expect a high
of 74 degrees...</i>

32
00:03:57,242 --> 00:04:00,867
<i>In financial news, commercial
real estate continues to suffer...</i>

33
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,200
- What's "obtuse" mean?
- Mmm.

34
00:04:03,283 --> 00:04:05,367
Like, annoyingly insensitive.

35
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,367
Has a girl ever
called <i>you</i> obtuse?

36
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,242
Only your mother, son.

37
00:04:11,492 --> 00:04:12,825
Were you?

38
00:04:12,908 --> 00:04:16,367
It could also mean, like,
very slow to understand.

39
00:04:17,742 --> 00:04:19,783
I'm pretty sure I was that.

40
00:04:19,867 --> 00:04:21,325
That makes more sense.

41
00:04:21,408 --> 00:04:24,867
Just tell her you're sorry
and you'll try harder.

42
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:28,908
I'm not taking dating advice from
you, Dad. No offense.

43
00:04:28,992 --> 00:04:31,075
Can girls have cooties
for one more year, please,

44
00:04:31,158 --> 00:04:33,950
while I mentally prepare
for what's coming?

45
00:04:34,033 --> 00:04:35,992
<i>This is
the scene in Fort Lauderdale,</i>

46
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:38,533
<i>at the home of District
Attorney Thomas Berdido,</i>

47
00:04:38,617 --> 00:04:42,200
<i>where it is now believed
he and his family were killed</i>

48
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:46,158
<i>in what fire officials are
calling a gas line explosion.</i>

49
00:04:46,242 --> 00:04:48,200
<i>Fort Lauderdale's police
chief says he intends</i>

50
00:04:48,283 --> 00:04:49,992
<i>to work closely
with fire officials</i>

51
00:04:50,075 --> 00:04:53,367
<i>to find a definitive cause
of this tragedy,</i>

52
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:55,617
<i>that has cost
this community a family</i>

53
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,950
<i>and one of its most
beloved leaders.</i>

54
00:05:00,825 --> 00:05:02,533
Dad, you all right?

55
00:05:04,325 --> 00:05:05,825
We're gonna be late.

56
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:25,700
- You ready?
- Yep.

57
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,158
Let's go.

58
00:05:33,658 --> 00:05:35,158
Right over there.

59
00:05:37,075 --> 00:05:38,742
Let's go.

60
00:05:38,825 --> 00:05:41,200
Jeez, Dad,
what's wrong with you?

61
00:05:47,408 --> 00:05:49,200
- Dad, what are you doing?
- We're playing hooky.

62
00:05:49,283 --> 00:05:50,950
I don't want to play hooky.
I have a chemistry exam at 8:00.

63
00:05:51,033 --> 00:05:52,242
We're playing hooky!

64
00:05:56,867 --> 00:05:58,908
No! No more texting.
No phone, okay?

65
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:01,783
Just give it to me.
Give... Give me the phone!

66
00:06:01,867 --> 00:06:04,283
Are you in trouble?
What did you do?

67
00:06:04,367 --> 00:06:06,992
The right thing,
you understand me?

68
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,658
I did the right thing.

69
00:06:10,742 --> 00:06:13,117
If you did the right thing,
then why are you so scared?

70
00:06:22,533 --> 00:06:27,992
The great history of smokejumpers
now rests on your capable shoulders.

71
00:06:28,075 --> 00:06:30,783
With every jump you make,
every fire you turn...

72
00:06:30,867 --> 00:06:32,950
- Look at those babies.
- Yup.

73
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:34,450
Hey, top me
off here, boss.

74
00:06:34,533 --> 00:06:36,492
You can't wait 15 minutes
for the party at the bar?

75
00:06:36,575 --> 00:06:38,617
Shut the fuck up, you were drunk
when I picked you up this morning.

76
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,700
That's very true.

77
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,825
Self-medicating your
way through it, huh?

78
00:06:44,325 --> 00:06:45,950
Oh, ladies and gentlemen.

79
00:06:46,033 --> 00:06:48,658
Ethan, where do they teach you
that stare that y'all have?

80
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,158
Not that one. That one.
That one, right there.

81
00:06:50,242 --> 00:06:52,117
- That one right here?
- Oh, that one.

82
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,492
- You feel it, Benny?
- I can see it right through your sunglasses.

83
00:06:53,575 --> 00:06:55,075
Going right into
my heart, my soul.

84
00:06:55,158 --> 00:06:56,617
Just a lot of hours
in front of the mirror, bud.

85
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,867
Oh, I bet. Mean and sexy.

86
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,950
Why'd they put you
in a fire tower?

87
00:07:02,825 --> 00:07:04,200
Well, I'm just lucky, I guess.

88
00:07:04,283 --> 00:07:06,825
- Yeah, fuck them and their tests.
- Assholes.

89
00:07:06,908 --> 00:07:07,950
Fuck them.

90
00:07:08,033 --> 00:07:10,492
- Fuck 'em all.
- Which tower?

91
00:07:10,575 --> 00:07:12,325
217, close to you.

92
00:07:12,408 --> 00:07:15,950
So keep the barbecues low, or I'm
gonna have to send in an air strike.

93
00:07:16,033 --> 00:07:17,658
Right. All right, listen.

94
00:07:17,742 --> 00:07:19,950
I'd really like today to
go different than last year

95
00:07:20,033 --> 00:07:21,992
and the year before that and every other
fucking year that came before that.

96
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:24,117
- Last year was fun.
- All right. Last year <i>was</i> fun.

97
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,992
So, who can tell me
what the goal of the day is?

98
00:07:27,075 --> 00:07:28,533
Threesome sounds
pretty good.

99
00:07:28,617 --> 00:07:30,075
Or winning the lottery.

100
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,450
Threesome for you
<i>would</i> be winning the lottery.

101
00:07:31,533 --> 00:07:33,117
- That's fucked up.
- Very true.

102
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,658
The goal, you fucking
clowns, for the day...

103
00:07:34,742 --> 00:07:36,367
- No fighting.
- Exactly right.

104
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:39,033
And please do not jump off of
shit with parachutes, okay?

105
00:07:39,117 --> 00:07:41,700
- Oh, who would do that?
- Oh, I have no idea.

106
00:07:41,783 --> 00:07:45,283
I... am older now,
and...

107
00:07:45,367 --> 00:07:46,867
Well, I'm older.

108
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,617
- Just trying to keep you alive.
- Hey, no, no, hey, hey.

109
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,575
Don't you worry about that.
That's our job.

110
00:07:50,658 --> 00:07:53,325
You just write the parking
tickets and we'll keep <i>you</i> alive.

111
00:07:53,408 --> 00:07:54,950
Fair enough.

112
00:07:55,033 --> 00:07:57,450
- Make good choices, please.
- Oh, here's to good choices.

113
00:07:57,533 --> 00:08:00,075
- Good choices!
- Now we're talking.

114
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:01,533
I'm feeling naughty.

115
00:08:01,617 --> 00:08:03,450
Well, me being
the team player...

116
00:08:03,533 --> 00:08:05,367
- I guess I can help you with that.
- Oh, no, no, no.

117
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:08,158
I do not have sex with a man
I have seen shit in the woods.

118
00:08:08,242 --> 00:08:10,867
Get the fuck out of here.
I have the very same rule.

119
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,992
You don't have sex with men
who shit in the woods?

120
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:15,533
- Who the fuck are you kidding?
- Oh, are we being too loud?

121
00:08:15,617 --> 00:08:18,158
Are we too loud, Ethan?
I'm sorry. I'm so...

122
00:08:18,242 --> 00:08:20,867
- How about this? Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

123
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,700
Congratulations!

124
00:08:32,992 --> 00:08:34,158
Come on now.

125
00:08:34,242 --> 00:08:35,575
Would you
just get into this?

126
00:08:35,658 --> 00:08:37,075
Could you just get
your head in the game?

127
00:08:37,158 --> 00:08:39,117
Hey, do you want to
dance with the devil?

128
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,117
I'm gonna show you how to dance with
the devil right now, you fucker.

129
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,408
- Ooh!
- Listen, the objective is to put it <i>in</i> the hole.

130
00:08:43,492 --> 00:08:45,700
- That's what she said.
- I'm gonna show you how to do it, snowflake.

131
00:08:45,783 --> 00:08:48,617
Boss...
you're up, let's go.

132
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,408
I do nothing involving
the word "corn."

133
00:08:51,408 --> 00:08:52,867
Oh, you coward.

134
00:08:58,408 --> 00:08:59,450
Yes!

135
00:09:00,325 --> 00:09:01,950
See? That's how it's done.

136
00:09:02,033 --> 00:09:03,492
- Nothing left to prove.
- How can I follow that?

137
00:09:03,575 --> 00:09:06,033
Give me that.
This is how you follow it.

138
00:09:06,117 --> 00:09:09,325
Yeah! Yeah!

139
00:09:09,408 --> 00:09:13,283
I'm not judging.
I'm just trying to understand.

140
00:09:13,367 --> 00:09:15,658
That's your
fucking boyfriend?

141
00:09:15,742 --> 00:09:17,242
Yes.

142
00:09:18,783 --> 00:09:20,492
I can't get my fucking
head around it.

143
00:09:20,575 --> 00:09:22,242
I don't understand,
why is it so funny to you?

144
00:09:22,325 --> 00:09:24,950
Oh, fuck, dude this is perfect!
He's fucking vaping!

145
00:09:25,033 --> 00:09:27,908
He's trying to quit smoking.
Stop being a fucking dick.

146
00:09:27,992 --> 00:09:30,950
- Vic! Ryan! She's... She's doing it!
- What, right now?

147
00:09:31,033 --> 00:09:32,117
She's fucking doing it,
come on!

148
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,075
- Parachute!
- Come on!

149
00:09:36,825 --> 00:09:38,867
You've learned nothing!

150
00:09:39,742 --> 00:09:41,492
- Oh, fuck!
- Let's go!

151
00:10:03,075 --> 00:10:04,533
Oh, fuck.

152
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:10,742
Shit.

153
00:10:10,825 --> 00:10:13,408
I remember the landing
being softer last time.

154
00:10:13,492 --> 00:10:16,075
Nope. It went
pretty much like that.

155
00:10:27,783 --> 00:10:29,575
What are you gonna do,
arrest me?

156
00:10:30,158 --> 00:10:31,075
Huh?

157
00:10:31,533 --> 00:10:32,867
Fuck.

158
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,700
You wonder why you failed
your psych eval, huh?

159
00:10:34,783 --> 00:10:37,158
Did you tighten these
with a fucking torque wrench?

160
00:10:37,242 --> 00:10:38,867
Oh, does it hurt?

161
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:42,700
- Yeah, it fucking hurts.
- Good. Maybe you'll learn something.

162
00:10:42,783 --> 00:10:44,700
Hey, eyes on me.
Quit your sulking, all right?

163
00:10:44,783 --> 00:10:47,033
You got yourself here.
This shit is on you.

164
00:10:47,117 --> 00:10:48,533
Fucking earned it.

165
00:10:58,075 --> 00:10:59,533
Let's go.

166
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,033
Here's the thing.

167
00:11:04,117 --> 00:11:06,533
We both know that had
nothing to do with fun,

168
00:11:06,617 --> 00:11:09,117
and it sure as shit wasn't
an accident, all right?

169
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,408
Look, H.,
I know what you're trying to do.

170
00:11:13,492 --> 00:11:16,575
Maybe those other assholes,
they don't see it, but I certainly do.

171
00:11:20,533 --> 00:11:24,200
You know, maybe a summer in a fire
tower by yourself do you some good.

172
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:25,658
- Maybe.
- Mm-hmmm.

173
00:11:25,742 --> 00:11:27,658
Maybe I'll just jump.

174
00:11:34,617 --> 00:11:36,492
Jesus Christ.

175
00:12:16,533 --> 00:12:18,283
It doesn't look like
they took anything.

176
00:12:18,367 --> 00:12:20,408
Toothbrushes still
in the bathroom.

177
00:12:36,783 --> 00:12:38,617
They're gone.

178
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,992
We need a destination. I'll take
the computer, you take the house.

179
00:13:05,617 --> 00:13:08,992
He withdrew $10,000 from his account.
He'll go dark now.

180
00:13:09,075 --> 00:13:11,992
We need to know the friend or
family member he's running to.

181
00:13:12,075 --> 00:13:13,200
All right.

182
00:13:15,283 --> 00:13:16,367
Come on.

183
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,450
Where are you going?

184
00:13:39,408 --> 00:13:43,075
Uh... How about the one
in law enforcement?

185
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,117
Survival school.

186
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,575
This keeps getting better.

187
00:14:03,408 --> 00:14:06,325
<i>What do you
know about my job, son?</i>

188
00:14:06,408 --> 00:14:08,200
- You're an accountant.
- Yeah.

189
00:14:08,283 --> 00:14:09,575
At least I thought you were.

190
00:14:09,658 --> 00:14:12,575
I'm a forensic accountant,
which means...

191
00:14:12,658 --> 00:14:15,033
I look for things
that don't add up.

192
00:14:15,867 --> 00:14:18,492
And I found some.

193
00:14:18,575 --> 00:14:23,325
The man I work for, he was killed
today because of what I found.

194
00:14:23,408 --> 00:14:25,950
But I still know it,
which means they're gonna...

195
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:28,117
They're gonna
come after me, too.

196
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,950
- We need to go to the police.
- No.

197
00:14:30,033 --> 00:14:32,867
The DA has police protection
24 hours a day.

198
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,908
And where were they
this morning?

199
00:14:34,992 --> 00:14:38,575
The case implicates a lot of people,
son, people with a lot to lose.

200
00:14:38,658 --> 00:14:43,117
Governors, congressmen...
We can only trust people that we know.

201
00:14:44,075 --> 00:14:45,658
You understand me?

202
00:14:47,992 --> 00:14:49,450
Yeah.

203
00:15:11,908 --> 00:15:14,283
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, you.

204
00:15:14,367 --> 00:15:16,992
- How's the bun?
- Cooking.

205
00:15:17,992 --> 00:15:19,242
Just, come here.

206
00:15:21,283 --> 00:15:22,742
Good to see you.

207
00:15:25,033 --> 00:15:27,492
- Mmm. How was your day?
- Oh, same old.

208
00:15:27,575 --> 00:15:29,117
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

209
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:33,033
I heard you had a little
run-in with the hotshot.

210
00:15:33,117 --> 00:15:36,783
Well, she's just letting her demons
run the show, you know what I mean?

211
00:15:36,867 --> 00:15:38,325
You weren't too hard
on her, were you?

212
00:15:38,408 --> 00:15:40,117
Maybe I was
a little hard on her.

213
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,325
But you know something,
she's an asshole.

214
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,033
She deserves it.

215
00:15:44,117 --> 00:15:45,533
She's plenty hard on herself

216
00:15:45,617 --> 00:15:47,783
and she probably doesn't
need any help from you.

217
00:15:47,867 --> 00:15:51,658
Nothing like arguing with my wife
about how I spoke to my ex-girlfriend.

218
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,825
Especially when
my wife takes her side.

219
00:15:53,908 --> 00:15:55,867
I'm not taking her side,
I'm just not taking yours.

220
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:58,200
You are taking her side,
because I don't even have a side.

221
00:15:58,283 --> 00:16:00,242
Then you're on her side.

222
00:16:00,367 --> 00:16:02,658
What is that,
like an accusation?

223
00:16:04,617 --> 00:16:07,033
Baby, are we fighting?

224
00:16:07,117 --> 00:16:08,492
God, men are simple.

225
00:16:08,575 --> 00:16:11,075
We're not fighting, babe.
Dinner's on the stove.

226
00:16:11,158 --> 00:16:14,617
There's beer in the fridge.
All's right with the world.

227
00:16:18,075 --> 00:16:19,742
Oh, did you feel that one?

228
00:16:19,825 --> 00:16:23,575
- Uh-uh. No.
- Oh, my God, how did you not feel that?

229
00:16:23,658 --> 00:16:25,033
I just didn't, baby.

230
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:26,908
- I think I know what it is.
- Hmm? What is it?

231
00:16:26,992 --> 00:16:28,867
I think it's that
concrete skull of yours.

232
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:31,700
I love how somehow it's my fault
that I don't feel the baby kicking.

233
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,408
Oh, babe,
everything's your fault.

234
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,408
- Everything is my...
- The baby is your fault.

235
00:16:35,492 --> 00:16:39,533
See, scientifically speaking,
it's 50% my fault, 50% your fault.

236
00:16:39,617 --> 00:16:41,575
- Is that what you think?
- That's what I think.

237
00:16:41,658 --> 00:16:43,408
- You know what I think?
- Oh, no, you're gonna put me in a headlock?

238
00:16:43,492 --> 00:16:45,200
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, no!

239
00:16:45,283 --> 00:16:50,158
I think that everything is your
fault until this kid turns four.

240
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:53,742
- We clear?
- Ah! We're so clear, baby.

241
00:16:53,825 --> 00:16:56,242
We're so clear. Mmm.

242
00:17:02,242 --> 00:17:03,492
Ah!

243
00:17:03,575 --> 00:17:04,742
Hello?

244
00:17:04,825 --> 00:17:07,200
- Allison. It's Owen.
- <i>Owen!</i>

245
00:17:07,283 --> 00:17:11,075
Hey. Could I talk to Ethan?

246
00:17:11,158 --> 00:17:14,408
- Um, I got a real problem.
- <i>Okay.</i>

247
00:17:20,492 --> 00:17:22,158
Owen, how you doing, man?

248
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:25,950
<i>Hey, Ethan. Um...
I've been better.</i>

249
00:17:26,575 --> 00:17:27,992
What's going on?

250
00:19:20,408 --> 00:19:23,742
- Hi, buddy.
- Hey.

251
00:19:25,283 --> 00:19:26,575
What are you writing?

252
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:28,700
It's for you.

253
00:19:30,158 --> 00:19:31,867
It's all my secrets.

254
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:38,367
But I don't want you to read it...
or even look at it.

255
00:19:40,908 --> 00:19:42,950
Promise?

256
00:19:43,033 --> 00:19:45,200
What am I supposed to
do with it?

257
00:19:56,158 --> 00:19:58,408
Give it to
someone you trust.

258
00:19:59,617 --> 00:20:00,908
When?

259
00:20:02,158 --> 00:20:04,242
With a little luck, never.

260
00:20:08,117 --> 00:20:10,242
I'm really sorry
about this, son.

261
00:20:12,367 --> 00:20:13,992
You did the right thing.

262
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,658
Right?

263
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:18,992
Yeah.

264
00:20:20,533 --> 00:20:22,158
I'm still sorry.

265
00:20:46,367 --> 00:20:47,992
That's it. Thanks.

266
00:20:48,075 --> 00:20:49,742
- All good?
- Yeah, good.

267
00:20:51,533 --> 00:20:53,450
Wasn't sure what you needed,
so I brought options.

268
00:20:53,533 --> 00:20:55,450
- Yeah, we'll take the truck.
- Roger that.

269
00:21:12,742 --> 00:21:16,575
It's a lot to swallow, Ethan.
How well do you know this guy?

270
00:21:16,658 --> 00:21:20,408
He was married to my sister.
The kid, he's... He's my nephew.

271
00:21:20,492 --> 00:21:22,992
- Top you off?
- Yeah.

272
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:26,325
- Would you like some?
- I'm okay, sweetheart.

273
00:21:26,408 --> 00:21:27,867
Sure you don't want
a piece of this steak?

274
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,492
You know I don't
eat that crap.

275
00:21:29,575 --> 00:21:31,283
- Yeah.
- That shit right there is gonna kill you.

276
00:21:31,367 --> 00:21:33,783
I think I rode this
ol' bull back in the '70s.

277
00:21:33,867 --> 00:21:35,908
I don't blame you for
not eating this meat.

278
00:21:37,492 --> 00:21:39,783
I don't know what you want
me to do for you, here.

279
00:21:39,867 --> 00:21:43,533
Well, I'm not sure what
I want you to do, either.

280
00:21:43,617 --> 00:21:44,950
If he's telling the truth,

281
00:21:45,033 --> 00:21:47,575
he needs the Marshal Service,
or the FBI.

282
00:21:47,658 --> 00:21:49,492
I said the same, but...

283
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:53,908
Like, he wanted me to call a TV
station, get a news crew down here.

284
00:21:53,992 --> 00:21:57,033
Don't be calling
no goddamn TV station.

285
00:21:57,117 --> 00:21:59,533
- We're not trying to invent a story here.
- All right.

286
00:21:59,617 --> 00:22:01,242
You let me know as soon
as he gets to your house.

287
00:22:01,325 --> 00:22:03,533
- I want to see this guy in person.
- You got it.

288
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,158
We're done.

289
00:22:08,242 --> 00:22:12,075
- Go, uh... stop crime.
- I'll do my best.

290
00:22:12,158 --> 00:22:15,575
You know, you should...
maybe consider a salad.

291
00:22:17,325 --> 00:22:19,575
- Who eats salad for breakfast?
- Fair enough.

292
00:22:19,658 --> 00:22:21,408
Sheriff?

293
00:22:21,492 --> 00:22:23,992
Your wife's calling.
Do you want to take the call?

294
00:22:24,825 --> 00:22:26,742
Absolutely not.

295
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:30,450
Connor!

296
00:23:38,242 --> 00:23:39,533
Hey, Connor!

297
00:23:42,075 --> 00:23:43,450
Back away from it.

298
00:23:44,908 --> 00:23:46,367
It's okay, Dad.

299
00:23:48,075 --> 00:23:49,533
He's nice.

300
00:23:54,242 --> 00:23:55,533
We gotta go, come on.

301
00:24:01,242 --> 00:24:02,325
Connor.

302
00:24:37,783 --> 00:24:40,533
Lynx lookout, copy?

303
00:24:40,617 --> 00:24:43,033
<i>Copy, Lynx.
Do you see smoke?</i>

304
00:24:43,117 --> 00:24:45,325
I see thunderclouds
and 30-mile-an-hour wind.

305
00:24:45,408 --> 00:24:49,033
Is there any precipitation
in that storm?

306
00:24:49,117 --> 00:24:52,158
<i>Lynx, keep this frequency clear
unless you see smoke.</i>

307
00:24:52,242 --> 00:24:54,158
<i>This ain't a party line.</i>

308
00:24:57,033 --> 00:24:58,575
Copy.

309
00:24:58,658 --> 00:24:59,867
Jackass.

310
00:25:14,992 --> 00:25:17,408
Hold the line!

311
00:25:17,492 --> 00:25:19,908
Shit! The wind is turning!

312
00:25:19,992 --> 00:25:21,283
That was our exit route!

313
00:25:21,367 --> 00:25:22,700
They got the wind wrong!

314
00:25:22,783 --> 00:25:24,367
We're fucking trapped!

315
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:25,742
Hannah!
What the fuck are we doing?

316
00:25:25,825 --> 00:25:26,825
- Deploy! Deploy!
- Deploy!

317
00:25:26,908 --> 00:25:28,617
Get the gear!

318
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,408
No, no, no,
I ain't cooking in this fucking thing.

319
00:25:30,492 --> 00:25:32,075
Leo! Leo, get back here!

320
00:25:33,325 --> 00:25:35,117
Leo! Watch out!

321
00:25:36,533 --> 00:25:38,575
Hannah!
Get in your shelter, let's go!

322
00:25:38,658 --> 00:25:43,575
- Help us, please!
- Hey, help me, please!

323
00:25:43,658 --> 00:25:46,075
- Hannah, they're gone.
- Help! Help me, please!

324
00:25:46,158 --> 00:25:47,617
They're gone!

325
00:25:56,325 --> 00:25:59,658
<i>Fire tower 217
Lynx, this is base. You copy?</i>

326
00:26:10,783 --> 00:26:13,033
This isn't a party line.

327
00:26:13,783 --> 00:26:16,242
Or so I'm told.

328
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:19,950
<i>Fuck that little prick.
He rides a scooter to headquarters.</i>

329
00:26:20,033 --> 00:26:21,742
<i>How you holding up?</i>

330
00:26:23,825 --> 00:26:28,075
I'm in a 20-by-20 box on
stilts with no toilet.

331
00:26:30,742 --> 00:26:32,450
I have to get out of here.

332
00:26:32,533 --> 00:26:34,658
I'll call you
on the sat phone.

333
00:26:39,325 --> 00:26:42,367
- Hey.
- <i>You somewhere better?</i>

334
00:26:44,033 --> 00:26:46,575
Define "better."

335
00:26:46,658 --> 00:26:50,242
<i>Giving you a psych eval three
days after the event was criminal.</i>

336
00:26:50,325 --> 00:26:52,283
<i>None of us could have passed.</i>

337
00:26:52,367 --> 00:26:56,117
<i>Forest Service looking for someone
to blame besides themselves.</i>

338
00:26:59,908 --> 00:27:01,950
I read the wind wrong.

339
00:27:02,033 --> 00:27:05,867
<i>They read it wrong,
then told you wrong.</i>

340
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:07,492
<i>Not your fault.</i>

341
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:12,242
<i>What choice did you have?</i>

342
00:27:18,617 --> 00:27:23,117
I should have gone to them,
and instead I was a fucking coward.

343
00:27:23,992 --> 00:27:26,033
<i>Then you'd be dead, too.</i>

344
00:27:27,367 --> 00:27:30,867
Well... that's our job.

345
00:27:34,825 --> 00:27:36,992
Do you think about it?

346
00:27:37,075 --> 00:27:39,200
<i>Every day.</i>

347
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:41,533
<i>Listen, don't do
anything stupid.</i>

348
00:27:41,617 --> 00:27:43,825
<i>There's a lot of people
who care about you.</i>

349
00:27:43,908 --> 00:27:48,408
- Yeah.
- <i>Come on, there's me, there's Ben...</i>

350
00:27:48,492 --> 00:27:49,867
<i>There's me.</i>

351
00:27:54,367 --> 00:27:58,283
Hey, you see that storm cell
12 o'clock to the tower?

352
00:27:58,367 --> 00:28:01,867
- You see that on the Doppler?
- <i>Yeah, it should bank north.</i>

353
00:28:03,783 --> 00:28:05,867
No, it's not banking north.

354
00:28:26,075 --> 00:28:32,867
Can you imagine what Lewis and Clark
must have thought when they saw that?

355
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,950
Do you think
they came this way?

356
00:28:35,033 --> 00:28:39,200
Right this way.
This is the Lewis and Clark trail.

357
00:28:39,283 --> 00:28:41,450
All we did was pave it.

358
00:28:45,575 --> 00:28:47,200
I like it out here.

359
00:28:48,283 --> 00:28:50,325
I like the space of it.

360
00:29:17,617 --> 00:29:19,117
That's a good spot.

361
00:29:20,075 --> 00:29:21,825
You'll have line of sight.

362
00:29:23,242 --> 00:29:24,908
Time since we last saw a car?

363
00:29:25,825 --> 00:29:27,908
It's six minutes.

364
00:29:27,992 --> 00:29:30,492
- It's a pretty good window.
- We do it here.

365
00:29:57,408 --> 00:29:59,700
Veer off, you bastard.

366
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,867
Fuck me.

367
00:30:22,617 --> 00:30:24,825
Vehicle approaching,
two klicks out.

368
00:30:24,908 --> 00:30:27,908
<i>Driver is female,
Montana plates.</i>

369
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:31,867
Alfa, echo, kilo,
five, five niner.

370
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:36,533
Registered to a Deborah
Killdeer in Red Lodge, Montana.

371
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:59,117
Motherfucker.

372
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:28,492
- Are you gonna help?
- Absolutely not.

373
00:31:32,992 --> 00:31:34,242
Duck!

374
00:31:44,367 --> 00:31:45,450
Ah!

375
00:32:04,408 --> 00:32:07,825
There's a fallen tree, right there
to the right. You hide under that.

376
00:32:07,908 --> 00:32:10,992
Don't make a sound, okay?
No matter what you see.

377
00:32:11,075 --> 00:32:14,950
Creeks lead to rivers,
rivers lead to towns.

378
00:32:17,825 --> 00:32:20,825
You call the news,
you call the TV station.

379
00:32:20,908 --> 00:32:22,617
You give them this.

380
00:32:23,533 --> 00:32:25,325
I want to stay with you.

381
00:32:25,908 --> 00:32:27,575
I love you, son.

382
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:32,075
Go! Go.

383
00:33:01,242 --> 00:33:04,325
- You all right?
- Yeah.

384
00:33:04,408 --> 00:33:05,825
Didn't see that coming.

385
00:33:12,033 --> 00:33:15,117
- There's movement.
- Will this fucker ever die?

386
00:33:58,825 --> 00:34:00,867
- We're blown.
- Fuck.

387
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:08,658
Are you okay?
Did somebody go over the edge?

388
00:34:08,742 --> 00:34:10,283
No, ma'am, it's okay.
Everything's fine.

389
00:34:52,908 --> 00:34:55,867
Hey, sweetheart, did they, uh...
they make it?

390
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:57,992
- <i>No, not yet.</i>
- Huh.

391
00:34:58,075 --> 00:34:59,158
<i>Are you almost home?</i>

392
00:34:59,242 --> 00:35:01,200
Yeah, I'm like
five minutes out.

393
00:35:11,325 --> 00:35:13,742
- Babe, let me call you back.
- <i>Sure, okay. Bye, babe.</i>

394
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,075
Shit.
We left that scene a mess.

395
00:36:01,158 --> 00:36:02,492
Oh, you want to clean it up?

396
00:36:02,575 --> 00:36:04,200
It is what it is.
This job needed two teams.

397
00:36:04,283 --> 00:36:06,367
Fucking two teams,
like I told 'em.

398
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:09,117
Fascinating where they
decide to save money.

399
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,242
<i>All units, code three.
CR-153 at mile marker 22...</i>

400
00:36:11,325 --> 00:36:14,075
- That was fast.
- That's the consequence of losing the initiative.

401
00:36:14,158 --> 00:36:15,658
<i>Two deceased,
one white male, mid-40s,</i>

402
00:36:15,742 --> 00:36:18,200
- <i>one white female, early 30s.</i>
- There's no boy.

403
00:36:18,283 --> 00:36:20,575
You think they're looking down from
the street, they can't see him?

404
00:36:20,658 --> 00:36:22,867
Yes, sir. Where?

405
00:36:24,325 --> 00:36:25,533
Yeah, we're en route.

406
00:36:26,908 --> 00:36:28,367
En route where?

407
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:30,158
He wants to meet.

408
00:36:30,242 --> 00:36:32,950
What, he's here?
Why is he here?

409
00:36:33,033 --> 00:36:35,492
He's... Fuck! Fuck!

410
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:00,617
<i>Please! Help us!</i>

411
00:37:29,617 --> 00:37:31,075
Hey, wait!

412
00:37:33,075 --> 00:37:34,033
Hey!

413
00:37:37,158 --> 00:37:38,575
Stop!

414
00:37:41,575 --> 00:37:42,867
Come here.

415
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:44,783
I'm not gonna hurt you.

416
00:37:48,033 --> 00:37:50,825
Stop! Stop! I'm not gonna hurt you.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

417
00:37:50,908 --> 00:37:52,783
I want to see where
the blood's coming from.

418
00:37:52,867 --> 00:37:54,033
It's not my blood.

419
00:37:55,408 --> 00:37:56,575
Whose blood is it?

420
00:37:59,617 --> 00:38:01,742
All right, listen.

421
00:38:01,825 --> 00:38:04,700
My name is Hannah.
What's yours?

422
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:07,367
- Fuck you.
- Oh, nice.

423
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:09,033
I'm a firefighter.

424
00:38:09,117 --> 00:38:12,450
I work with the Forest
Service, and I can help you.

425
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,283
All right?

426
00:38:15,367 --> 00:38:17,450
Talk to me and I'm
gonna help you, okay?

427
00:38:19,117 --> 00:38:20,867
All right.

428
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,450
Good luck!

429
00:38:23,117 --> 00:38:24,867
Good luck.

430
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:27,367
Town is 12 miles that way...

431
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:29,283
over the Continental Divide.

432
00:38:29,367 --> 00:38:30,950
Have fun with that.

433
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:35,658
Wait!

434
00:38:40,367 --> 00:38:41,575
Yeah?

435
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,867
I have a radio in a tower...
over there.

436
00:38:53,117 --> 00:38:56,450
- We can call the sheriff or...
- No, not the sheriff, the news.

437
00:38:57,617 --> 00:38:58,992
Can you call the news?

438
00:39:02,575 --> 00:39:05,992
Yeah. Sure, I...
I can call whoever you want.

439
00:39:16,325 --> 00:39:17,908
You're fucking fast.

440
00:39:18,867 --> 00:39:20,033
Man!

441
00:39:31,992 --> 00:39:35,575
- Want me to drop you closer?
- He doesn't want us any closer.

442
00:39:36,158 --> 00:39:37,742
Okay.

443
00:39:37,825 --> 00:39:40,200
Pull around the front.
I'll meet you there when we're done.

444
00:40:14,783 --> 00:40:17,617
- What's with the limp?
- It's nothing.

445
00:40:20,617 --> 00:40:22,325
You missed the boy.

446
00:40:23,658 --> 00:40:25,200
That seems unlikely.

447
00:40:25,825 --> 00:40:27,533
Hmm.

448
00:40:27,617 --> 00:40:31,200
We promise absolutes,
and "unlikely" is not an absolute.

449
00:40:33,825 --> 00:40:36,117
The man was resourceful enough
to make it all the way here,

450
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,950
so assume he was resourceful
enough to have duplicates

451
00:40:40,033 --> 00:40:42,783
of everything we retrieved
from the DA's office.

452
00:40:42,867 --> 00:40:46,825
And assume that those duplicates
are in the possession of that boy.

453
00:40:49,617 --> 00:40:51,950
Assume the worst
case scenario.

454
00:40:53,825 --> 00:40:56,117
Assume catastrophe and...

455
00:40:56,825 --> 00:40:58,367
act accordingly.

456
00:40:58,450 --> 00:40:59,992
It's a lot of risk.

457
00:41:00,075 --> 00:41:02,033
That, I am aware of.

458
00:41:02,117 --> 00:41:05,325
You have, what, maybe six hours
before this thing's untenable?

459
00:41:05,408 --> 00:41:08,033
I can buy us more time.

460
00:41:08,117 --> 00:41:09,950
But they have to
have the stomach for it.

461
00:41:11,825 --> 00:41:14,450
I will make them
have the stomach for it.

462
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:17,867
Should have been
two teams.

463
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:19,575
Hit 'em
at the same time.

464
00:41:19,658 --> 00:41:21,700
What got us here doesn't really
matter, now, does it, Jack?

465
00:41:21,783 --> 00:41:24,117
- No, it doesn't.
- No, it doesn't.

466
00:41:25,617 --> 00:41:29,533
It's a zero-sum game.
Treat it that way.

467
00:42:27,533 --> 00:42:30,283
- Are we going to the station?
- Brother-in-law...

468
00:42:31,908 --> 00:42:33,992
I think.

469
00:42:34,075 --> 00:42:35,658
Maybe we get lucky.

470
00:42:35,742 --> 00:42:37,825
This is a lot of risk
for a boy.

471
00:42:37,908 --> 00:42:41,242
Well, they're worried
about what he might know.

472
00:42:41,325 --> 00:42:43,325
And what he saw us do.

473
00:42:46,158 --> 00:42:50,950
From this point forward,
we put down anyone who sees our faces.

474
00:42:51,033 --> 00:42:55,950
That's gonna bring a lot of attention to
this town. There's enough of that already.

475
00:42:56,033 --> 00:42:58,450
Give 'em something else
to worry about.

476
00:43:17,825 --> 00:43:19,408
Let 'em focus on this
for a while.

477
00:44:08,242 --> 00:44:09,325
Yep.

478
00:44:17,783 --> 00:44:19,408
Allie, there's
no sign of Connor.

479
00:44:19,492 --> 00:44:21,200
<i>Well, are they looking?</i>

480
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:23,450
Yeah, they're gonna set up
a search crew, but...

481
00:44:29,117 --> 00:44:32,033
<i>Ethan?
Ethan, are you still there?</i>

482
00:44:51,742 --> 00:44:53,117
Oh, God.

483
00:45:03,908 --> 00:45:05,742
Let's get you warm.

484
00:45:16,575 --> 00:45:18,158
You hungry?

485
00:45:19,533 --> 00:45:20,992
No.

486
00:45:21,075 --> 00:45:23,075
Well, you should eat anyway.

487
00:45:24,992 --> 00:45:26,367
Here. Here's some...

488
00:45:28,033 --> 00:45:30,283
Candy and shit in it. Here.

489
00:45:35,408 --> 00:45:37,742
So, here's the deal, buddy.

490
00:45:37,825 --> 00:45:42,117
The tower was hit by lightning.
Everything is fried.

491
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,325
So we can't...

492
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:44,950
Fucker.

493
00:45:46,908 --> 00:45:49,825
So we can't
call the sheriff, or...

494
00:45:49,908 --> 00:45:51,783
fuck me... anybody.

495
00:45:52,867 --> 00:45:55,075
We are gonna have to
hike to town.

496
00:46:01,867 --> 00:46:05,408
So I need to know whether
we should do that tonight,

497
00:46:05,492 --> 00:46:07,492
or if we can wait
till morning.

498
00:46:09,742 --> 00:46:10,950
Are you in trouble?

499
00:46:14,075 --> 00:46:17,117
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

500
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,408
Anyone else in trouble?
Anyone we need to be looking for?

501
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:26,533
Not anymore.

502
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,867
All right.

503
00:46:46,075 --> 00:46:47,950
Well...

504
00:46:48,033 --> 00:46:50,825
You don't seem
much up for a hike.

505
00:46:55,033 --> 00:46:57,700
My dad said if anything
happened to him,

506
00:46:57,783 --> 00:46:59,908
I should find someone
I can trust.

507
00:47:11,533 --> 00:47:13,617
Something happen
to your dad?

508
00:47:17,033 --> 00:47:19,117
Are you someone
I can trust?

509
00:47:29,575 --> 00:47:32,367
I'm absolutely
someone you can trust.

510
00:48:13,783 --> 00:48:15,158
Where'd they find him?

511
00:48:15,825 --> 00:48:17,492
On the road.

512
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:20,283
I hid under a tree.

513
00:48:21,283 --> 00:48:23,200
And ran down to the creek.

514
00:48:23,283 --> 00:48:26,408
'Cause creeks lead to rivers,
and rivers lead to towns.

515
00:48:27,908 --> 00:48:29,658
That they do.

516
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:32,492
All right. Okay.

517
00:48:36,908 --> 00:48:41,075
- Are we leaving tonight?
- We're leaving right now.

518
00:48:47,075 --> 00:48:49,033
<i>The fire has
now jumped containment break delta</i>

519
00:48:49,117 --> 00:48:51,242
<i>and is moving
toward Highway 12.</i>

520
00:48:51,325 --> 00:48:54,367
<i>Winds are north-northwest
at seven miles per hour.</i>

521
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:57,075
<i>We are currently at
zero percent containment...</i>

522
00:48:58,117 --> 00:48:59,700
Babe, I have been calling...

523
00:49:02,075 --> 00:49:04,617
- Can I help you?
- I'm Agent Freers, this is Agent Michaels.

524
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:07,450
Were with the FBI.
Is Deputy Sawyer here?

525
00:49:07,533 --> 00:49:09,617
He's still on duty.
You can try him on your radio.

526
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:12,450
- We run different frequencies.
- Change the channel.

527
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:14,658
We spoke earlier and he
asked us to meet him here.

528
00:49:14,742 --> 00:49:16,158
Do you mind if we come in?

529
00:49:17,908 --> 00:49:19,200
Yes, I do.

530
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:28,533
Show me your hands.

531
00:49:48,617 --> 00:49:50,075
House is clear.

532
00:49:53,033 --> 00:49:54,742
I think she's pregnant.

533
00:50:01,408 --> 00:50:02,950
You pregnant?

534
00:50:05,783 --> 00:50:08,867
- How many months?
- Six.

535
00:50:10,325 --> 00:50:11,492
Boy or girl?

536
00:50:13,158 --> 00:50:14,742
Girl.

537
00:50:14,825 --> 00:50:18,742
Well, I want you to think about
her when I ask you these questions.

538
00:50:21,158 --> 00:50:23,367
You run a survival school?

539
00:50:25,658 --> 00:50:29,200
Telling me the truth
is how you survive.

540
00:50:32,783 --> 00:50:34,700
- Is the boy here?
- No.

541
00:50:34,783 --> 00:50:36,575
- Has he been here?
- No.

542
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:38,867
- Have the police found him?
- Not that I know of and I would know.

543
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:42,367
- But this is where he'll come?
- I don't know.

544
00:50:46,075 --> 00:50:50,367
Now, that sounds like you're telling
us the truth, Allison, but...

545
00:50:51,867 --> 00:50:53,617
we have to know.

546
00:50:56,242 --> 00:50:58,033
I am telling the truth.

547
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:02,908
I have to know.

548
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:08,742
I am telling the truth!

549
00:51:11,033 --> 00:51:12,450
I have to know.

550
00:51:12,533 --> 00:51:14,450
I'm telling the truth.

551
00:51:14,533 --> 00:51:17,117
Okay, my husband found him!
My husband found him!

552
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,950
- He's with my husband!
- Where'd he take him?

553
00:51:19,033 --> 00:51:21,200
I don't know, he didn't tell me!
But I can call him!

554
00:51:21,283 --> 00:51:24,117
- I can call him!
- Okay.

555
00:51:25,117 --> 00:51:26,783
Call him.

556
00:51:35,575 --> 00:51:36,742
Where's the phone?

557
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:45,075
You keep this
conversation casual.

558
00:51:45,992 --> 00:51:47,575
You hear me?

559
00:51:53,242 --> 00:51:54,783
Okay.

560
00:51:58,283 --> 00:52:01,158
<i>Hey, baby, I'm dealing
with this fire. What's going on?</i>

561
00:52:01,242 --> 00:52:04,408
Hey, babe, how's the...
how's the boy?

562
00:52:04,492 --> 00:52:06,325
- <i>What?</i>
- Is he hungry?

563
00:52:06,408 --> 00:52:08,450
I bet he's hungry. I'll make him
something to eat if he's hungry.

564
00:52:08,533 --> 00:52:11,825
That's a distress word.
You gave him a fucking distress word!

565
00:52:13,825 --> 00:52:15,575
You fucking survivalists!

566
00:52:15,658 --> 00:52:18,158
You wanna survive? I'll give you
something to fucking survive.

567
00:52:21,283 --> 00:52:25,033
- You're pointing that the wrong way.
- No, I'm not.

568
00:52:53,617 --> 00:52:56,367
- You good?
- No, I'm fucking not.

569
00:52:56,450 --> 00:52:58,075
Fuck!

570
00:52:58,158 --> 00:53:00,367
I'm a mother pheasant
plucker, I pluck mother pheasants.

571
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:02,742
I'm the most pleasant mother pheasant
plucker to ever pluck a mother pheasant.

572
00:53:02,825 --> 00:53:06,408
I'm a pheasant mother plucker,
I pluck mother pheasants.

573
00:53:06,492 --> 00:53:09,283
- I'm the most pleasant mother pheasant...
- Pleasant mother fucker...

574
00:53:09,367 --> 00:53:11,867
- Ooh!
- The most pleasant mother...

575
00:53:13,867 --> 00:53:15,575
All right, break's over.

576
00:53:15,658 --> 00:53:17,242
Okay, we gotta get downhill.

577
00:53:17,325 --> 00:53:19,325
We're gonna take turns running.
When I say "stop," you stop.

578
00:53:19,408 --> 00:53:21,242
You get down like this,
and I'm gonna run past you.

579
00:53:21,325 --> 00:53:23,700
We're gonna keep switching.
Okay, ready? Go, run!

580
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:27,908
Down!

581
00:53:32,742 --> 00:53:33,658
Run!

582
00:53:36,283 --> 00:53:37,575
Down!

583
00:53:39,825 --> 00:53:41,075
Run!

584
00:53:57,117 --> 00:53:58,950
No, no.

585
00:53:59,033 --> 00:54:00,867
Please, please.

586
00:54:05,117 --> 00:54:06,658
You got hit.

587
00:54:07,242 --> 00:54:08,533
Missed me.

588
00:54:11,242 --> 00:54:12,783
You got hit.

589
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:16,033
No, buddy, it missed me.

590
00:54:19,575 --> 00:54:21,908
We gotta go.

591
00:54:21,992 --> 00:54:23,825
He died right in front of me.

592
00:54:40,992 --> 00:54:43,533
Let it out, buddy.
Let it out.

593
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:54,325
There's no blood trail.

594
00:54:54,408 --> 00:54:58,617
- You think we got her?
- It's 50-50, I couldn't see shit.

595
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:00,533
Ah, fuck.

596
00:55:00,617 --> 00:55:04,908
- You okay? Don't look good.
- Well, there's nothing I can do about that now.

597
00:55:08,408 --> 00:55:09,450
Go deep.

598
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:18,075
Allie?

599
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:23,658
Dispatch, this is Alpha One.
We need two more guys.

600
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:30,700
Drop your weapon!
Drop it! Drop it now!

601
00:55:30,783 --> 00:55:33,158
Drop it right fucking now!

602
00:55:33,242 --> 00:55:37,200
Drop your fucking weapon!
Step in the road. Step in the road.

603
00:55:38,325 --> 00:55:41,575
Stop. Face away from me.

604
00:55:41,658 --> 00:55:44,908
You're about to be a father. That's
the only thought I want in your mind.

605
00:55:44,992 --> 00:55:47,617
Now, very slowly,
unbuckle your service belt,

606
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:49,950
drop it to the ground,
toss it to the left.

607
00:55:55,742 --> 00:55:56,950
Drop to your knees.

608
00:56:00,075 --> 00:56:02,283
Allow yourself
to fall forward.

609
00:56:03,033 --> 00:56:04,283
Fall forward.

610
00:56:06,783 --> 00:56:08,533
Hands behind your back.

611
00:56:09,825 --> 00:56:12,242
- Backup weapon?
- Right ankle.

612
00:56:14,492 --> 00:56:16,075
We have another man
with your wife.

613
00:56:16,158 --> 00:56:17,742
On my word,
she will be executed.

614
00:56:17,825 --> 00:56:19,075
You will not be
a father anymore.

615
00:56:19,158 --> 00:56:20,783
- Do you understand?
- I understand.

616
00:56:20,867 --> 00:56:24,075
According to your wife,
the boy's with you.

617
00:56:24,158 --> 00:56:25,575
Now, if that were true,
there'd be a much bigger

618
00:56:25,658 --> 00:56:27,200
police presence
in your yard right now.

619
00:56:27,283 --> 00:56:28,867
The boy hasn't been found.

620
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:32,867
We think he was tossed
from the vehicle in the crash.

621
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:34,825
There's a search crew who was
gonna go out in the morning,

622
00:56:34,908 --> 00:56:37,450
but that got called off
because of the fire.

623
00:56:37,533 --> 00:56:40,533
Search is exactly what
you and I are going to do.

624
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:43,783
Jack...

625
00:56:43,867 --> 00:56:45,950
You really think we should
leave that loose end?

626
00:56:46,033 --> 00:56:49,242
Clock is ticking.
We don't have time to search for both.

627
00:56:49,325 --> 00:56:50,575
Okay, let's go.

628
00:56:51,158 --> 00:56:52,283
Up.

629
00:56:57,367 --> 00:57:00,575
A few years from now,
you are gonna find yourself near a lake,

630
00:57:00,658 --> 00:57:03,992
or a forest behind your house,
with some saucy blonde,

631
00:57:04,075 --> 00:57:08,658
and you are gonna want to take
full advantage of that situation.

632
00:57:08,742 --> 00:57:13,492
Campfires are like catnip
for teenage girls.

633
00:57:13,575 --> 00:57:17,950
And all you need is some
fuel, some heat...

634
00:57:19,825 --> 00:57:21,658
and <i>voila!</i>

635
00:57:21,742 --> 00:57:24,783
You're swapping spit
with a cheerleader.

636
00:57:24,867 --> 00:57:29,450
- Getting struck by lightning made you weird.
- I was already weird.

637
00:57:31,408 --> 00:57:32,950
You just look sad to me.

638
00:57:37,158 --> 00:57:38,575
I look sad?

639
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:52,992
There was a fire last year that
I was in charge of fighting.

640
00:57:53,783 --> 00:57:55,367
And...

641
00:57:55,450 --> 00:57:58,492
I thought the wind was doing one
thing, and it was doing another.

642
00:57:58,575 --> 00:58:04,283
So instead of fighting it,
we found ourselves running from it.

643
00:58:04,367 --> 00:58:07,575
Which is not where
you want to be.

644
00:58:11,575 --> 00:58:15,200
And there were three boys...

645
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:17,033
around your age...

646
00:58:19,617 --> 00:58:23,283
They got caught in the fire,
and all I could do was watch.

647
00:58:29,325 --> 00:58:31,533
I watched my mother
die of cancer.

648
00:58:35,158 --> 00:58:38,617
It is impossible to feel sorry
for myself around you.

649
00:58:43,367 --> 00:58:44,575
I'm sorry.

650
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:47,033
Me, too.

651
00:58:48,325 --> 00:58:50,325
All right. Let's just...

652
00:58:51,742 --> 00:58:53,242
Let's get you warm, buddy.

653
00:58:57,117 --> 00:58:59,992
- My dad called me buddy.
- Aw, fuck.

654
00:59:00,075 --> 00:59:02,658
I'm sorry,
I won't call you buddy.

655
00:59:02,742 --> 00:59:04,492
No, it's fine.

656
00:59:06,867 --> 00:59:08,450
You can call me buddy.

657
00:59:13,575 --> 00:59:15,742
I'm warm. Let's go.

658
00:59:21,408 --> 00:59:23,450
No fucking way
the kid survived that.

659
00:59:23,533 --> 00:59:25,450
Well, he ain't here.

660
00:59:25,533 --> 00:59:27,283
You want to
search up the hill?

661
00:59:28,575 --> 00:59:30,617
Like I said,
they'll send a team.

662
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:32,075
I'll check it out.

663
00:59:32,158 --> 00:59:34,200
I'll tell you this much,
I've seen a thousand wrecks.

664
00:59:34,283 --> 00:59:37,283
There's no way somebody survives
that, let alone a kid.

665
00:59:37,367 --> 00:59:41,075
Well, good. Should be easy to find then.
So let's start fucking looking.

666
01:00:22,575 --> 01:00:25,325
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What was that?

667
01:00:27,158 --> 01:00:28,242
Move.

668
01:00:37,908 --> 01:00:40,325
Yeah, the kid made it.

669
01:00:40,408 --> 01:00:43,367
Guess we're about to judge
your tracking skills, deputy.

670
01:00:45,950 --> 01:00:48,450
No, I don't think
you're gonna judge shit.

671
01:00:52,242 --> 01:00:53,950
Yeah, I think I'm done.

672
01:00:55,450 --> 01:00:58,575
I think I'm gonna
go ahead, I'm...

673
01:00:58,658 --> 01:01:00,658
I'm just gonna
keep my dignity.

674
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:04,908
Look, we know how this thing's
gonna end, right?

675
01:01:06,283 --> 01:01:07,492
Fuck it, I know.

676
01:01:09,783 --> 01:01:11,492
So let's just fucking
do it now, huh?

677
01:01:11,575 --> 01:01:15,075
Play your cards right, Deputy,
you could live through this.

678
01:01:17,950 --> 01:01:19,867
What the fuck do I look like?
Do I...

679
01:01:19,950 --> 01:01:22,367
I look like the stupidest
motherfucker on this planet?

680
01:01:22,450 --> 01:01:24,908
- Take a couple of steps back, Jack.
- Fuck you!

681
01:01:24,992 --> 01:01:26,283
You gonna
let me live, huh?

682
01:01:26,367 --> 01:01:28,867
- Yeah.
- Oh, fuck that'd be mistake.

683
01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:30,908
You let me live and
I will shout your description

684
01:01:30,992 --> 01:01:32,367
to anybody
who will fucking listen.

685
01:01:32,450 --> 01:01:34,117
- No, you won't.
- I'll fucking hunt you down!

686
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:36,533
You hear this fucking guy?
If I play my cards right, huh?

687
01:01:36,617 --> 01:01:38,783
- I will fucking kill you.
- Fucking kill me. Shoot me.

688
01:01:38,867 --> 01:01:40,700
- What are you waiting for?
- Give me the word, Jack.

689
01:01:40,783 --> 01:01:43,242
Come on, give him the word.
I'm gonna fucking die right here!

690
01:01:43,325 --> 01:01:44,742
- Right here!
- Jack, give me the word.

691
01:01:44,825 --> 01:01:46,408
Fuck you. And fuck you.

692
01:01:48,325 --> 01:01:49,783
Jack, move left!

693
01:02:00,367 --> 01:02:02,992
You will not talk. Ever.

694
01:02:03,658 --> 01:02:05,783
You know why?

695
01:02:05,867 --> 01:02:07,908
Because when
we find this boy,

696
01:02:09,117 --> 01:02:11,575
I'm not killing him.
You are.

697
01:02:13,533 --> 01:02:15,742
That's how bad I don't want
to shoot a pregnant woman.

698
01:02:18,825 --> 01:02:21,617
But you try this shit again,

699
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:23,825
I will fucking
burn her alive.

700
01:02:23,908 --> 01:02:25,867
- Have I made myself clear?
- Yeah.

701
01:02:27,075 --> 01:02:28,200
Yeah?

702
01:02:29,117 --> 01:02:30,408
Now, track.

703
01:02:42,908 --> 01:02:44,325
Move.

704
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:52,158
You okay, brother?

705
01:02:52,242 --> 01:02:55,158
You're not making much sense
when you talk.

706
01:02:55,242 --> 01:02:58,075
I am so fucking
sick of this place.

707
01:03:16,908 --> 01:03:19,242
- Is that a fire?
- Yeah.

708
01:03:20,658 --> 01:03:22,450
And it's a big one.

709
01:03:28,658 --> 01:03:30,617
We gotta go back.

710
01:03:36,117 --> 01:03:37,325
I'm not going
through that again.

711
01:03:37,408 --> 01:03:39,200
We can't go through <i>that.</i>

712
01:03:39,283 --> 01:03:41,242
That eats everything
in its path.

713
01:03:41,325 --> 01:03:43,950
I would have seen this from the tower.
I didn't call it in.

714
01:03:44,033 --> 01:03:46,742
They're gonna send a chopper
to figure out why.

715
01:03:46,825 --> 01:03:49,325
Chopper is that way,
back there.

716
01:03:49,408 --> 01:03:51,867
You don't get through that.
We're going that way.

717
01:03:51,950 --> 01:03:53,158
All right?

718
01:03:56,950 --> 01:03:58,033
Now.

719
01:04:48,033 --> 01:04:49,242
Oh!

720
01:04:49,325 --> 01:04:50,617
You.

721
01:05:21,908 --> 01:05:26,075
- You okay?
- Oh, yeah. I'm peachy.

722
01:06:03,617 --> 01:06:06,450
- Turn around.
- Why? I don't care.

723
01:06:06,533 --> 01:06:08,075
We've shared enough today.

724
01:06:09,325 --> 01:06:10,783
Come on.

725
01:06:53,075 --> 01:06:56,117
Connor. Get down off the bed.

726
01:06:57,408 --> 01:06:59,200
Get down off the bed.

727
01:07:01,367 --> 01:07:02,617
Quiet.

728
01:07:15,325 --> 01:07:16,992
Listen...

729
01:07:17,075 --> 01:07:20,575
Those men that came for your
father, did you see their faces?

730
01:07:21,908 --> 01:07:24,242
- Yeah.
- Come here.

731
01:07:29,950 --> 01:07:31,325
What?

732
01:07:31,408 --> 01:07:32,783
Is that them?

733
01:07:42,492 --> 01:07:44,200
That's them.

734
01:07:44,283 --> 01:07:46,617
- Get under the bed.
- No. We can't stay here.

735
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:48,450
I know. Get under the bed.

736
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:51,075
Go.

737
01:07:51,158 --> 01:07:52,950
Hey, how many people
stay in those?

738
01:07:53,033 --> 01:07:55,492
Usually one, but...

739
01:07:55,575 --> 01:07:58,325
from the looks of it,
there's nobody home.

740
01:07:58,408 --> 01:08:00,617
Somebody's home.

741
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:04,283
What kind of fire watcher leaves
his cabin with a fire burning?

742
01:08:04,367 --> 01:08:08,533
What are the chances that
fire watcher has a weapon?

743
01:08:08,617 --> 01:08:11,825
You're in the forest of Montana,
so the chances are pretty good.

744
01:08:17,242 --> 01:08:20,033
There's no tactical approach
to the top of that tower.

745
01:08:20,117 --> 01:08:22,367
He'll know whoever's up there.
They'll show themselves to him.

746
01:08:22,450 --> 01:08:25,825
We put them all down from here.
It's the safest play.

747
01:08:25,908 --> 01:08:28,617
Yeah, I don't have
a better idea.

748
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:30,158
Hey, you're going
up that tower.

749
01:08:31,617 --> 01:08:35,158
Boy's in there,
you're gonna bring him down to me.

750
01:08:35,242 --> 01:08:36,992
If he isn't,

751
01:08:37,075 --> 01:08:40,075
start a fire in the middle of that
cabin and burn it to the ground.

752
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:43,408
- Why burn it?
- So I know you ain't lying.

753
01:08:44,575 --> 01:08:45,825
Go on, go.

754
01:08:46,742 --> 01:08:48,158
Move.

755
01:09:08,867 --> 01:09:11,742
Nobody's here!
The door's locked!

756
01:09:11,825 --> 01:09:14,325
It won't be the first door
you've kicked in.

757
01:09:17,450 --> 01:09:19,742
Come on, we need
some higher ground.

758
01:09:25,575 --> 01:09:28,575
If you're hidden,
you stay hid.

759
01:09:28,658 --> 01:09:33,408
There's a rifle trained on me.
There's two of them and they're both armed.

760
01:09:46,992 --> 01:09:49,158
Connor, you're doing great.

761
01:09:49,242 --> 01:09:51,367
You just stay there,
okay?

762
01:09:52,367 --> 01:09:54,908
Don't move. Don't talk.

763
01:09:56,992 --> 01:09:58,742
You got a weapon in here, H.?

764
01:10:00,658 --> 01:10:02,908
I have a pretty sharp axe.

765
01:10:02,992 --> 01:10:05,075
Afraid that's not gonna do it.

766
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:08,908
I, uh...

767
01:10:08,992 --> 01:10:10,950
I don't know how to
get us out of this.

768
01:10:14,283 --> 01:10:17,575
The fire's gonna be here in about an hour.
That should get us out of this.

769
01:10:18,450 --> 01:10:19,950
We don't have an hour.

770
01:10:23,992 --> 01:10:25,617
Fuck.

771
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:28,325
I see nothing.
No movement.

772
01:10:29,367 --> 01:10:30,867
He's just standing there.

773
01:10:33,450 --> 01:10:35,117
I'm fading here, partner.

774
01:10:38,867 --> 01:10:40,450
I know.

775
01:10:44,533 --> 01:10:46,200
Wait, he's talking.

776
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:50,908
Yeah, he's talking, Jack.

777
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:54,908
Get him out of here, H!

778
01:10:54,992 --> 01:10:56,158
Run!

779
01:11:00,158 --> 01:11:01,700
Come on, Connor!

780
01:11:04,117 --> 01:11:05,783
All right! Okay!

781
01:11:12,242 --> 01:11:13,992
Go, H!

782
01:11:14,075 --> 01:11:16,658
- Come on!
- Go, Connor! Go!

783
01:11:18,908 --> 01:11:20,492
I got you.

784
01:11:24,408 --> 01:11:26,867
- Movement! Running west!
- Fuck.

785
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:30,450
Take the shot! Take the fucking shot!

786
01:11:30,533 --> 01:11:32,200
I got not shot! Fuck!

787
01:11:34,742 --> 01:11:36,700
Okay. We move.

788
01:11:38,575 --> 01:11:40,742
Contact, right!

789
01:11:48,367 --> 01:11:50,283
That was a deer rifle.

790
01:11:50,367 --> 01:11:53,242
All right, I'll take the
shooter, you take the boy.

791
01:11:53,325 --> 01:11:57,992
If there's even a chance that it's her...
I take the shooter.

792
01:11:59,408 --> 01:12:01,533
All right.

793
01:12:01,617 --> 01:12:03,575
Rendezvous back here.

794
01:12:04,825 --> 01:12:06,742
Can you cover me?

795
01:12:06,825 --> 01:12:08,867
- Moving.
- Move.

796
01:12:25,825 --> 01:12:27,200
Keep going.

797
01:12:28,325 --> 01:12:29,492
Toward the fire?

798
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:32,117
Yeah, buddy.

799
01:13:12,492 --> 01:13:13,783
Just...

800
01:13:15,033 --> 01:13:17,325
stop for
a fucking minute!

801
01:13:25,617 --> 01:13:27,242
Where's my husband?

802
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:31,575
Tower.

803
01:13:32,742 --> 01:13:35,825
- Is he alive?
- I don't know.

804
01:13:40,075 --> 01:13:41,283
You're out.

805
01:13:42,158 --> 01:13:43,367
Fuck.

806
01:14:11,492 --> 01:14:13,408
I hate this fucking place.

807
01:14:16,450 --> 01:14:18,242
It hates you back.

808
01:14:36,908 --> 01:14:38,158
Go.

809
01:14:48,867 --> 01:14:50,033
Come on.

810
01:14:53,367 --> 01:14:54,617
Come on.

811
01:14:56,033 --> 01:14:57,242
Come here.

812
01:15:00,992 --> 01:15:02,450
Come here.

813
01:15:02,533 --> 01:15:03,908
Come here.

814
01:15:04,992 --> 01:15:06,783
Listen to me.

815
01:15:06,867 --> 01:15:09,825
You're gonna run a hundred
yards towards the fire.

816
01:15:09,908 --> 01:15:14,075
You're gonna turn left and you're gonna
keep running until you get to a creek.

817
01:15:14,158 --> 01:15:17,575
When you get to a creek,
you find the deepest, widest part,

818
01:15:17,658 --> 01:15:20,617
- and you get in and you lay down.
- No.

819
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:22,450
- You understand?
- No.

820
01:15:22,533 --> 01:15:24,075
- I'm not...
- No, I'm not leaving you!

821
01:15:24,158 --> 01:15:26,867
Hundred yards, left. Creek.

822
01:15:26,950 --> 01:15:30,200
Hundred yards, left.
Say it.

823
01:15:31,658 --> 01:15:33,950
- Say it! Hundred yards...
- Hundred yards, left.

824
01:15:34,033 --> 01:15:36,992
- Hundred yards, left. Creek.
- Hundred yards, left. Creek.

825
01:15:37,075 --> 01:15:39,325
When you get there,
what are you gonna do?

826
01:15:39,408 --> 01:15:41,158
- Lay down.
- What are you gonna do?

827
01:15:41,242 --> 01:15:42,742
Lay down.

828
01:15:43,825 --> 01:15:44,950
Go.

829
01:15:46,617 --> 01:15:48,033
Go.

830
01:16:06,742 --> 01:16:09,617
Oh, shit. God damn it.

831
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:12,117
Ethan?

832
01:16:15,992 --> 01:16:17,200
Hey, sweet girl.

833
01:16:19,950 --> 01:16:22,283
How did you...

834
01:16:22,367 --> 01:16:24,617
- Where you hit, babe?
- Yeah, I can't...

835
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:26,617
I can't tell how bad it is.

836
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:27,992
Will you check for an exit?

837
01:16:28,075 --> 01:16:30,950
- Oh, God.
- Okay.

838
01:16:31,033 --> 01:16:33,242
- Okay.
- Oh, shit.

839
01:16:35,575 --> 01:16:37,742
How bad is it? Yeah.

840
01:16:39,158 --> 01:16:41,825
- It ain't good, babe.
- It's okay.

841
01:16:41,908 --> 01:16:43,533
- Okay.
- It's okay.

842
01:16:43,617 --> 01:16:45,283
- Okay?
- Yeah.

843
01:16:45,367 --> 01:16:46,825
- Okay.
- Did you get 'em?

844
01:16:46,908 --> 01:16:49,367
I got one.
I don't know where the other one is.

845
01:16:51,408 --> 01:16:54,325
You did good. All right.

846
01:16:55,658 --> 01:16:57,742
You gotta
get out of here now.

847
01:16:57,825 --> 01:16:59,450
- Hey.
- No, I'm not leaving you.

848
01:16:59,533 --> 01:17:01,867
It's about our baby girl.

849
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:05,158
Nothing matters if she don't make
it, you understand me?

850
01:17:06,658 --> 01:17:08,908
No one makes it
through that, baby.

851
01:19:09,992 --> 01:19:11,700
Come on.

852
01:19:11,783 --> 01:19:14,075
You really want
to die for this kid?

853
01:19:15,908 --> 01:19:17,658
You don't even know him.

854
01:19:19,242 --> 01:19:23,825
You know, if you walk away...
right now, I won't fire.

855
01:19:28,325 --> 01:19:29,992
You got my word, okay?

856
01:19:31,867 --> 01:19:33,450
Just walk away.

857
01:19:37,450 --> 01:19:40,408
Hey! You looking for me?

858
01:19:52,075 --> 01:19:53,742
Fuck you!

859
01:19:58,450 --> 01:19:59,950
Connor, run!

860
01:20:07,617 --> 01:20:08,825
Connor!

861
01:20:10,283 --> 01:20:11,950
You're gonna hide, huh?

862
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:17,658
I'll show you what happens
when you run and hide.

863
01:20:24,367 --> 01:20:26,658
When you come out,
I'll stop.

864
01:20:28,617 --> 01:20:31,367
Keep hiding,
I'll keep hurting her.

865
01:20:33,242 --> 01:20:35,200
You watching this? Huh?

866
01:20:35,283 --> 01:20:37,575
- Don't come out!
- Shut the fuck up!

867
01:20:37,658 --> 01:20:40,700
If I come out,
will you let her go?

868
01:20:42,533 --> 01:20:45,075
No, I won't.

869
01:20:45,158 --> 01:20:48,700
You know, it won't be this.
She won't suffer.

870
01:20:54,242 --> 01:20:55,700
Okay.

871
01:20:55,783 --> 01:20:57,033
Stop!

872
01:21:04,533 --> 01:21:06,033
That's good.

873
01:21:07,908 --> 01:21:09,283
Now, don't run.

874
01:21:10,492 --> 01:21:12,325
Okay? No more running.

875
01:21:16,825 --> 01:21:18,575
Can you turn around for me?

876
01:21:21,700 --> 01:21:23,617
That's it, just turn around.

877
01:22:14,575 --> 01:22:15,742
You okay?

878
01:22:16,783 --> 01:22:18,158
Do it.

879
01:22:19,158 --> 01:22:20,867
- Do it.
- Look.

880
01:22:26,408 --> 01:22:28,158
The fire will do it for me.

881
01:22:28,242 --> 01:22:30,783
- You can fucking suffer.
- Fuck you.

882
01:22:30,867 --> 01:22:33,117
Run. Run.

883
01:22:39,408 --> 01:22:41,033
Fuck!

884
01:22:57,450 --> 01:23:00,158
They'll have planes
in the air soon.

885
01:23:00,242 --> 01:23:02,450
Wonder whether
we'll still be here.

886
01:23:06,867 --> 01:23:08,950
I don't know.

887
01:23:14,117 --> 01:23:15,867
I love you.

888
01:23:15,950 --> 01:23:17,742
I love you.

889
01:23:25,450 --> 01:23:26,617
Bye, babe.

890
01:23:57,117 --> 01:23:58,242
Run!

891
01:23:59,492 --> 01:24:00,658
Come on!

892
01:24:06,325 --> 01:24:07,908
Can you swim?

893
01:24:07,992 --> 01:24:10,575
- What?
- Can you swim?

894
01:24:32,033 --> 01:24:33,867
Okay, listen to me.

895
01:24:33,950 --> 01:24:37,325
Take a deep breath,
hold it and lay back.

896
01:24:37,408 --> 01:24:38,742
Watch what I do.

897
01:26:19,033 --> 01:26:20,408
Hey.

898
01:26:25,325 --> 01:26:28,242
- I fell asleep.
- I noticed.

899
01:26:33,408 --> 01:26:34,908
What's wrong?

900
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:37,742
Nothing.

901
01:26:38,408 --> 01:26:40,533
Come on. Let's go.

902
01:26:42,575 --> 01:26:46,367
- Where are we going?
- Anywhere but here, buddy.

903
01:27:32,367 --> 01:27:35,200
- Tower's still standing!
- It went right over!

904
01:27:40,158 --> 01:27:42,033
I got a live body!
I got a live body!

905
01:27:42,117 --> 01:27:45,158
- We jump here! Vic!
- You're green!

906
01:27:45,242 --> 01:27:46,408
Go! Go!

907
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:35,533
Let's move!

908
01:28:45,783 --> 01:28:47,950
I got two people!

909
01:28:48,033 --> 01:28:49,575
My three o'clock, see 'em?

910
01:28:49,658 --> 01:28:51,283
- It's Hannah.
- Do you see 'em?

911
01:28:51,367 --> 01:28:52,867
Keep going, I got it!

912
01:28:52,950 --> 01:28:54,658
Go. Go.

913
01:29:08,533 --> 01:29:10,242
God damn, Hannah.

914
01:29:10,325 --> 01:29:12,492
We looked it
right in the eye.

915
01:29:13,950 --> 01:29:15,158
What was it like?

916
01:29:17,575 --> 01:29:19,658
It was beautiful.

917
01:29:21,617 --> 01:29:25,033
I didn't think it was beautiful.
It scared the shit out of me.

918
01:29:26,283 --> 01:29:28,617
Well, it scared the shit
out of me too, sport.

919
01:29:29,700 --> 01:29:31,533
Take a look at that cut.

920
01:29:39,033 --> 01:29:40,700
Got to win one, I see.

921
01:29:46,617 --> 01:29:47,742
Thanks.

922
01:29:53,992 --> 01:29:57,783
Jesus Christ.
The fuck happen here?

923
01:30:03,367 --> 01:30:05,367
- I got one on the right, now.
- I got it, I got it.

924
01:30:05,450 --> 01:30:09,283
Hey, hey, hey, sit down.
Sit down, honey.

925
01:30:09,367 --> 01:30:11,992
Allison, look at me.
Hey, look at me.

926
01:30:12,075 --> 01:30:13,992
Come on, now.

927
01:30:14,075 --> 01:30:15,450
We need a medevac.

928
01:30:17,367 --> 01:30:20,617
Manifest 12-92.
I need a medevac to my location.

929
01:30:20,700 --> 01:30:22,242
Target my beacon, please.

930
01:30:22,325 --> 01:30:24,075
<i>Roger that, 12-92...</i>

931
01:30:24,158 --> 01:30:26,117
There's no rush.

932
01:30:29,742 --> 01:30:30,908
Okay.

933
01:30:43,742 --> 01:30:45,658
Is it coming back for us?

934
01:30:46,825 --> 01:30:49,075
Yeah, buddy,
it's coming back.

935
01:31:03,075 --> 01:31:06,533
It's past the tents,
near the mobile medical unit.

936
01:31:06,617 --> 01:31:08,783
Truck. It's a big white truck.

937
01:31:19,950 --> 01:31:21,242
Mmm!

938
01:31:22,408 --> 01:31:26,033
- You eat these?
- Three meals a day.

939
01:31:27,783 --> 01:31:29,867
No wonder you're so skinny.

940
01:31:30,700 --> 01:31:34,492
I'm lean, buddy. I'm lean.

941
01:31:36,533 --> 01:31:40,283
- What happens next?
- Well, you do the interview...

942
01:31:40,367 --> 01:31:42,575
No, I mean after that.

943
01:31:43,783 --> 01:31:46,367
I mean tomorrow.
Next month.

944
01:31:50,033 --> 01:31:51,908
Where am I gonna go?

945
01:31:55,242 --> 01:31:56,783
I don't know.

946
01:32:00,492 --> 01:32:02,617
But I promise you...

947
01:32:02,700 --> 01:32:04,783
we're gonna
figure it out together.

948
01:32:25,992 --> 01:32:28,367
Yeah, we're here, on site.

949
01:32:33,533 --> 01:32:36,700
- Here we go. Let's go.
- All right. All right, yeah, we got this.

950
01:32:36,783 --> 01:32:38,117
- Got it?
- Yeah.
