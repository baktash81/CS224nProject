1
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,721
An accident has

2
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,680
<i>been reported at Chai Wan
Nuclear Power Station.</i>

3
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,289
Hathaway. Cell search.
Hands behind you.

4
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,002
Open 16.

5
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,485
Go, go, go!

6
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,204
Search everything.

7
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,800
Get off that!
Hey!

8
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,005
Take him down!

9
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,726
One, two, three, up!

10
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,883
Stay strong, <i>carnal.</i>

11
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,210
This was found
in your cell.

12
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,329
You added $900 to all your
pals' commissary accounts

13
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,368
in your cell block.

14
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,442
Is this the attack tool?

15
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,885
With it,
you open up a terminal

16
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,207
and that gives
you a command line?

17
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,649
That how you broke into the network
and plussed-up the balances?

18
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,720
No.

19
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,007
I used it to call Santa
in the North Pole

20
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,481
and told him to do
Christmas early this year.

21
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,242
What do we know
about this guy?

22
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,169
His grandfather was
a military commander

23
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,571
in Shanghai in the '20s,

24
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,564
in the '30s against the
Japanese through the Civil War.

25
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,008
His father became
China's Undersecretary
for Trade to the UN.

26
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,320
He came with to New York.

27
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,528
Bronx High School
of Science, MIT.

28
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,807
His sister's a network engineer
in the private sector.

29
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,211
She grow up
in New York, too?

30
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,966
No.

31
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,129
He's a rising star in PLA's
Cyber Defense section.

32
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,406
Liaise with them?

33
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,122
It's inviting them
into the henhouse, Carol.

34
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,208
Stanley, we go head-to-head
with the Chinese

35
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,442
on their cyber intrusion
every day of the week.

36
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:02,764
Not a bad idea to be face-to-face
working with them, for once.

37
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,441
You monitor very closely what they
do and do not have access to.

38
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,567
Okay?

39
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,008
Okay?
Send the code.

40
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,880
Okay.

41
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,680
Let's go somewhere we can talk.
Hey, hey...

42
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,007
English might be better.
Come on.

43
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,451
Tomorrow? I can't.
It's impossible.
Why not?

44
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,443
I've got
an optical-overlay network

45
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,002
that's got to be up
in 17 days.

46
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,287
They sent me
some code tonight.

47
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,728
The black hat who hit
the Chai Wan reactor.

48
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,366
When I looked at the
code, it was, uh...

49
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,126
And?

50
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,849
I have to have a network
engineer with me I can trust.

51
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,810
Really trust.

52
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,041
Like, 100%.

53
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,964
When do we leave?

54
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,009
<i>The meltdown in China
and the run-up in soy yesterday</i>

55
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,527
<i>was facilitated
by the same RAT.</i>

56
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,967
How it got loaded in
in the first place,
we don't know.

57
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,283
But, once inside,
it de-cloaked and
became what it really is.

58
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,522
A remote access tool.

59
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,961
A RAT.

60
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,362
The RAT's job was to open a back
door in our system and call home.

61
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,203
The black hat then used his back
door to inject a second part.

62
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,289
It's payload.

63
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,847
That is what rode up soy.

64
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,809
Now that we're looking at the
RAT and payload closely,

65
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,006
we're thinking
they were...

66
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,004
Written by different authors.

67
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,083
How we figured that out
was through the coding in the RAT.

68
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,482
Though several years old,
it is lean, graceful.

69
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,564
The payload's coding,
on the other hand,
feels frenetic, confused...

70
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,041
Frenetic?
Or overwritten?

71
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,650
So, the question
we're dealing with is...

72
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,041
Is there somewhere
we can talk?

73
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,131
...and if it is two,
they may not be working
in close proximity.

74
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,651
Daniels is qualified
in computer forensics.

75
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,769
An intern could have
written that report.

76
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,320
Oh, really?
And who do we need,
if not Daniels?

77
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,165
And "liaise" in "liaison
group" implies mutuality.

78
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,244
You don't like our boy,
what ideas are you
bringing to the dance?

79
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,050
A man named Hathaway.

80
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,886
He's a convicted hacker,

81
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,123
serving 15 years in U.S.P.
Canaan in Waymart,
Pennsylvania.

82
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,568
You telling me
some hacker in prison

83
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,768
is hitting our
financial markets?

84
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,047
No. But we want
Hathaway on the team

85
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,849
so he can help out
the investigation.

86
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,849
He hit four
major banks,

87
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,247
ran up $46 million
in damages.

88
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,084
And that's just
what we know about.

89
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,968
You want the DOJ to do
anything other than laugh?

90
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,446
Daniels said two authors
wrote the virus.

91
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,089
I don't know who
wrote the second half,
but the first half, the RAT,

92
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,687
the remote access tool that Daniels
called "lean and graceful"?

93
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,366
One of the original authors
is me.

94
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,727
I co-wrote it,

95
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,041
as a gag,
years ago at MIT.

96
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,681
And my roommate,
the genius lead author?

97
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,091
Nicholas Hathaway.

98
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,321
That's right.

99
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,011
The hacker found the RAT
online and modified it.

100
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,208
If we want to move
around within this code

101
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,009
looking for clues to
the hacker's identity,

102
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,162
we need it's lead architect.

103
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,723
The reactor in China,
I heard about,

104
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,121
but the spike
in soy futures...

105
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,200
All right,
I didn't know any of this.

106
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,442
We don't get a lot
of new news in here.

107
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,002
The US government would like
your technical advice on this.

108
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,641
In exchange for that,
we're going to furlough
you right out of here.

109
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,246
You sign that
on the last page,

110
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,685
and we'll get
you processed.

111
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,881
You'll wear
an ankle bracelet

112
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,610
and be accompanied
by a US Marshal.

113
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,365
Your computer access
will be restricted.

114
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,286
If you wanna study
the whole document,
you can go right ahead.

115
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,446
I can come back
in a month or two.

116
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,090
No, I'm done.

117
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,520
You didn't sign it.

118
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,164
Yeah.
Why would I sign it? Why?

119
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,481
Because of the generosity
of the Assistant US Attorney

120
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,971
in granting you a furlough.

121
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,088
Both you and
the Assistant US Attorney

122
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,844
can stick that
document up your ass.

123
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,046
I'm sorry?

124
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,964
Why are you sorry?

125
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,611
I insulted you.
What are you sorry for?
I'm not sorry.

126
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,688
Don't think you're gonna...
Hey.

127
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,603
You wanna raise
me up out of here,

128
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,728
solve your trade
exchange dilemma,

129
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,371
and I get a furlough
for a couple of weeks?
You kidding me?

130
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,522
You have any idea how much
progress you're gonna make

131
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,762
on a strike this complex
without someone like me?

132
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,606
Zero.

133
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,125
This isn't a negotiation.

134
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,326
I just made it one.

135
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,040
You want me?
You pass this upstairs.

136
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,930
If my assistance results
in the identification

137
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,685
and the apprehension
of the guy you're after,

138
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,007
I want you to commute
my sentence.

139
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,324
If I come up empty,
you toss my ass
back in the can.

140
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,449
Those are the terms.

141
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,605
Guard.

142
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,284
Interview's over.

143
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,089
Barrett, how badly
do you need this guy?

144
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,685
It's so good
to see you, bro.

145
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,649
Not half as much as it
is for me to see you.

146
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,569
Let's get out of here.

147
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:43,401
So, you planned to reunite with your
friend from the moment you landed?

148
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,244
It entered my mind.

149
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,080
You okay?

150
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,805
Yeah, I'm fine.

151
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:37,486
Okay. Please keep
them out of sight,
if you can help it.

152
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,404
See? He ripped off
and repurposed our code.

153
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,729
- What the hell is this?
- What?

154
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,043
The agreement was an approval
and a presence for
his computer access.

155
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,202
I approved it.
A DOJ approval.

156
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,611
Now you're changing
the goalposts?

157
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,284
<i>Hola, chica.</i>
You came to me.

158
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,600
How am I supposed
to do my work?

159
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,920
On an abacus
or something?

160
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,050
<i>"Chica"?</i>
Am I Hispanic?

161
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,884
What the hell's going on?

162
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,689
I advocated
getting you over here.

163
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,445
I pulled every string to get your
convicted felon sprung, Mr. Chen.

164
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,284
"Captain" Chen.
And I didn't ask.

165
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,442
I offered partnership,
an equivalent,

166
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,646
or we would do it
on our own.

167
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,928
Well, I'll be happy
to bust him back to Canaan

168
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,321
and put your ass on the
first plane back to China.

169
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,890
He apologizes.

170
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,004
My brother misunderstood
our arrangement,
Special Agent.

171
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,091
Look around.

172
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,920
I have to run
the morning backup.

173
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:52,366
Your network is sitting
behind deep packet inspection,

174
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,442
intrusion protection.

175
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,204
It's extensively
firewalled.

176
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,129
Exactly.

177
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,000
So somebody had to physically enter
this room and plug the virus in.

178
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,447
We reviewed keycard
scans and surveillance tapes.

179
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,010
There was no
unauthorized entry.

180
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,242
Now, we're thinking about
a routing weakness.

181
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,810
That's too complicated.
He wouldn't have done that.

182
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,326
Yeah. Well,
what you're proposing
didn't happen.

183
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,847
There's only one person who's
authorized to access these terminals.

184
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,921
Me.

185
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,367
And my password
is my thumbprint.

186
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,767
May I?

187
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,521
Sure.

188
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,281
Can I have some
approval now?

189
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,288
All right.
This is the code for our RAT.

190
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,805
See, it's compact.
It's slick.

191
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,723
Under a meg.
You would never
have picked up on it.

192
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,326
Ever leave that
USB drive on your desk?

193
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,441
I suppose so.

194
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,603
Who works here
who doesn't like you?
Recently hired? Fired?

195
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,727
No.

196
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,081
Who?

197
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,885
Lozano.

198
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,883
His mother passed away.
He left two weeks ago.

199
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,361
John Lozano.
He was only
on the job for a month.

200
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,080
- He have access to your office?
- Yes.

201
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,930
I'll pull his
employment records.

202
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,770
Everything will
come up phony.

203
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,011
Except this.
You got his photo ID?

204
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,250
Yeah.

205
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,802
This section of his code
right here is a mess.

206
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:38,966
There's 25 lines,
he's left text.
It looks incomplete.

207
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,804
Are they notes to himself?

208
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,405
Dead-end ideas?

209
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,565
Maybe he's still writing.

210
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,641
Yeah, that's good.

211
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,244
So if you've got the ability
to move a commodity

212
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,885
any way you want,
what do you do?

213
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,964
I play it out long and low-key.
I do not do one big spike.

214
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,640
Instead, I'd play it
out month after month.
Less risk of detection.

215
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:01,930
Yeah, right.
But our guy jacks soy
250% in a day.

216
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,651
Mmm-hmm.
It's flashy. He knows
he's gonna bring down heat.

217
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,603
Maybe he needs cash.

218
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,011
Fast.

219
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,765
He's got the money
from the soy run-up.

220
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:18,242
And he's busy writing
code for what's next.

221
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,845
I think the real hit
is still to come.

222
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,440
We have Lozano's photo.

223
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,970
What's on his neck?

224
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,883
Kid had tattoos.

225
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,003
You have any
routine surveillance tapes?

226
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,201
Right there.

227
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,850
Face of stone.

228
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,324
<i>Pollack.</i>
It's me.

229
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,927
Can you have someone
jump on the NCIC database?

230
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,967
<i>Search for Latino males
under 30 with priors in,</i>

231
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,047
<i>I don't know,
anything like carding,
identity theft,</i>

232
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,090
who were in West Texas
prison gangs.

233
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,449
Our cowboy has a tattoo
on his shoulder.
He's with Los Zapotecas.

234
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,640
<i>I'm sending you
something right now.</i>

235
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,284
That's him
in the bottom left.

236
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,723
<i>Alonzo Reyes.
Did two years in
Huntsville for carding.</i>

237
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:37,327
<i>Paroled. Moved back to LA.
I'll have LA pick him up.</i>

238
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,290
He's gonna monitor
his home grid. I did.

239
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:44,081
We got a better shot getting a
first look at him ourselves.

240
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,840
Isn't that why
you brought me here?

241
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,041
Okay?

242
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,646
Yeah. Go ahead.

243
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,843
That means you and
me are on the money.

244
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,127
Unless you think you can
do that on your own, too.

245
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,201
I do okay.

246
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,321
You do, huh?

247
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,404
Let's see how you handle
the financial sector.

248
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,770
Thanks, Stanley.

249
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,441
My eye's on you.

250
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,851
Where do you think
I'm going?

251
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,208
This guy is one step away from
my "get out of jail free" card.

252
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,806
<i>So...</i>

253
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,651
How can I help?

254
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,085
We want to see
your trading records

255
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,801
of your traders who took large
profits from the soy run-up.

256
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,403
You're requesting
I turn over records

257
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,209
to the FBI
and a foreign power

258
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:03,329
on thousands of private
brokers and traders?

259
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,008
Afraid I can't possibly
accommodate you.

260
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,923
You're gonna protect the person
who manipulated your market?

261
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,050
No. You're casting
your net way too wide,
Mr. Chen.

262
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,167
You want to see my data,

263
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,765
you come up with something
a little more tangible.

264
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,922
Something more in the way
of probable cause

265
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,206
than your hunch.

266
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,169
Gary.
May I call you Gary?

267
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,244
How's this for tangible?

268
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,166
In the next 15 seconds
I call Laura Greer

269
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,004
at the Commodities
Trading Commission.

270
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,690
And I say,
"Laura, how you doing?

271
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,401
"I'd like to launch an official
investigation on one Gary Baker."

272
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,606
So the headline,

273
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:41,811
"M-Tech Official Investigated for
Aiding and Abetting Cyber Criminals"

274
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,087
leaks to CNN
in the next 90

275
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,208
so it makes the three
o'clock news cycle,

276
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,362
as well as
the nightly news.

277
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,204
That'd be good, too.

278
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,044
Am I being tangible?

279
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,041
Gary?

280
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,403
Look around here.
But I stay here with you.
No take nothing.

281
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,001
<i>Hey, mi carnal?</i>

282
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,289
What happened to you?

283
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,570
He has WRT hardware
and an onion router.

284
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:28,486
He can route encrypted data and
stay anonymous with no IP address.

285
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,521
Yeah,
somebody must have
told him how to set it up.

286
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,366
She probably called 911.

287
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,451
Who's the woman?

288
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,768
It's the manager.
Mrs. Novo.

289
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,490
Here, let me see it.

290
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,205
Here. Try it now.

291
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,007
Barrett, this is Jessup.

292
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,001
Mmm-hmm.
Thanks, Jessup.

293
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,082
Well, we better make following
the money pay off,

294
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,083
Reyes isn't. He's dead.

295
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,565
Oh, great.

296
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,280
Wait a minute.

297
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,523
We've been looking
for buyers of soy.
Switch to sellers.

298
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,887
Only our player would know
exactly when to get out.

299
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:59,481
Reyes got an email
about a drop tonight.

300
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,046
With no Reyes,
we gotta find a new link
to our main player.

301
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,690
I'm gonna see who shows.

302
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,568
You tell Jessup?

303
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,688
No. They'll spot
him 10 blocks away.

304
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,211
You get into not
enough for one day?

305
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,251
Look,
I play it my way,
it works.

306
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,607
It don't,
at least I own it.

307
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,411
I go, too.

308
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,284
You look not so different
from the pictures.

309
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,644
What pictures?

310
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,531
That my brother
sent me before.

311
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,683
Why you're in prison?

312
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,366
Hmm.

313
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,921
I was in a bar,
I met some girl,

314
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,690
and some guy got
in my face about her.

315
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,649
He started a fight
and when it's over,

316
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,484
he's in the hospital
and I'm arrested.

317
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:28,650
I wound up sentenced to
18 months at MCI-Norfolk.

318
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,882
I traded academia
for gladiator academy.

319
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,763
Then what?

320
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,966
Then I got out.

321
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,041
I'm 22,

322
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,487
and not a lot going
on in Silicon Valley

323
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,688
for an ex-con with no degree.
So.

324
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,921
Carding?

325
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,810
Yeah, that and
I was in wholesaling internationally.

326
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,121
I had an eight-year run,
then the Feeb caught up
with me.

327
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,248
And I got 13 years.

328
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,610
You have regrets?

329
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,841
Regrets? No.

330
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,809
The banks got hit for
the losses, not people.

331
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,530
I didn't burn people.
I don't burn people.

332
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,681
No.

333
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,967
I mean, banks are chiseling
everybody all the time, anyway.

334
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,326
I don't feel sorry
for banks, no.

335
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,643
I mean, I'm sorry for
what happened to you.

336
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,481
Don't be.
I'm not fishing for sympathy, here.

337
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,928
I did the crime,
I'm doing the time.
Time isn't doing me.

338
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,331
What's that mean?

339
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,801
I do my own time,
not the institution's.

340
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,325
See, to hold on to
who you are in there,

341
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,488
you dedicate yourself
to your program.

342
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,450
You work out on your
body and your mind.

343
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,004
Open your eyes.

344
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,845
What'd you say?

345
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,969
You talk like you
are still in prison.

346
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,090
But you're not in prison.

347
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,400
Get your thinking
to where you are,
not where you've been.

348
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,363
What do you know
about where I've been?

349
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,480
No. Nothing.

350
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,567
No, nothing.
But...

351
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,211
Okay, tell me,
what is it I'm supposed
to start seeing so fast?

352
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,280
Where you are.

353
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,089
What, Koreatown?

354
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,362
- This restaurant, this table?
- What?

355
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,889
You'll be in the rapid
stream of decision-making.

356
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,201
Having to make
intuitive choices.

357
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,966
The people against you
are high-speed,
world-class dangers.

358
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,930
To be genius coder
to outsmart, out-think

359
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,082
like my brother
always said you could,

360
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,080
you have to think
about it clear.

361
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,968
Not easy, I know.

362
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,771
There's no transition time.

363
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,770
But I believe you
are a very strong man.

364
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,251
Very smart man.

365
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,681
Here, Chen.

366
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,360
Three trades.

367
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,890
Three different accounts.
Large volumes.

368
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,485
They all sell within
minutes of each other.

369
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:50,484
Just at the soft close,
at 13:13 and 13:14.

370
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,164
Timed perfectly
when to dump.

371
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,081
What's that?

372
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,801
- Bank accounts. Foreign.
- Same place, all three.

373
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,126
Where?

374
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,010
Hong Kong.

375
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,771
You want your bill?

376
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,605
You not order more,
you give up table.

377
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,206
You're really hurting
for space, huh?

378
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,762
Maybe our guy
is no-show.

379
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,970
What is it?

380
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,721
Let's go.

381
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,040
What's happening?

382
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,410
Who are you?

383
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,767
Why are you here?

384
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,841
Who are you?

385
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,121
Watch out!

386
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,206
Ahhh!

387
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,001
Hey, hey! Hey!

388
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,091
<i>And Reyes
probably was killed.</i>

389
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,563
<i>The email on his
computer was bait.</i>

390
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,723
<i>Whoever this is wanted to see
if we were on Reyes' trail.</i>

391
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,165
<i>We're burned.</i>

392
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,084
Could you track it
to our guy's location?

393
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:25,161
No, the video feed went through
a proxy server in the Ukraine.

394
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,561
Who knows where
it bounces to off that?

395
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:30,963
Yeah, and our players
are foreign, too.

396
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,360
What about the money?

397
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,442
<i>Three accounts,
all in the same place.</i>

398
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,090
They took $74 million.

399
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,288
We're going to
follow the money.

400
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,771
<i>Where?</i>

401
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,649
Put my sister on.

402
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:02,045
We're flying
to China in the morning.

403
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,004
<i>- My dad was a steel worker.
- Single father.</i>

404
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,969
<i>He raised us on his own.</i>

405
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,281
<i>Came to visit, twice.</i>

406
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,124
<i>Then he got sick.</i>

407
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,802
I used to replay memories

408
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:10,609
so I could stay oriented
for when I got out.

409
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,811
Captain Chen?

410
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,087
Paul Wang, CNCERT.

411
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,207
In here.

412
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,850
What's the status?

413
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:37,729
We're trying to restore
coolant by pumping in sea water.

414
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,404
I got more injured.

415
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,486
Since it happened,

416
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,530
was there any
demand for money?

417
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:47,601
No.

418
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,566
Then it's not
about extortion.

419
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:53,122
Is he political?
A terrorist attack?
Any declaration?

420
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,884
No claim. No statement.

421
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,730
What does this guy want?

422
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,686
What did
the malware attack?

423
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:03,491
Programmable Launch
Controllers. PLCs.

424
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,608
They tell the pumps
to turn on, turn off,

425
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:06,841
to cool the reactor.

426
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,366
Any idea where
the attack originated?

427
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,480
I was tracking the
malware when the core went.

428
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,125
We had to evacuate.

429
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,884
But if a machine failed,

430
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,611
it should have saved the
memory to a diagnostic file.

431
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:21,524
Yeah, that's right.
And in that memory dump
may be your traces of code.

432
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,568
Maybe even this
guy's real IP address.

433
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:26,007
But those servers are
in the control room.
Everything is still hot.

434
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,491
We're fighting
a meltdown.

435
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,641
Chen Lien.

436
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:24,600
Inspector Alex Trang,
Hong Kong Police.

437
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:28,366
Hathaway,
US Marshal Mark Jessup.

438
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,601
Hello.

439
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,325
So, is this them?

440
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,120
These the guys?

441
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,400
Yeah.

442
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,005
We got anything?

443
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:41,966
Here they are.

444
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,605
Johnny Li,
Yan Lin, Samuel Wu.

445
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,082
Li just got out of
prison two months ago.

446
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,322
Yan and his mother
are both junkies.

447
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,845
Wu runs a chop shop.

448
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:54,010
Hardly commodities
speculators.

449
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,242
They're fronts?
Proxies?

450
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,286
So how do they communicate?

451
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,044
How do they connect up
to our actor?

452
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:08,167
They don't.

453
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,049
Phones,
the Internet.

454
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:12,202
And we've been on them
all day and all night.

455
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,281
Nothing.

456
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,682
If you were our player,
right now,

457
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:18,125
what would be
your next move?

458
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,884
I'd make my trail go cold.

459
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,405
How?
I'd cash out.

460
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:22,931
Cash money doesn't
leave a trail.

461
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,162
Pick it up.
Walk it anywhere you want.

462
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,049
But the money
hasn't moved yet.

463
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,327
There's no activity
in the accounts.

464
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,565
Yeah,
this is all too clean.

465
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,449
I mean, there's got to be
somebody between them,

466
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,841
talking to them,
instructing them,
telling them what to do.

467
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:41,161
There has to be
someone in contact.

468
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,288
It wouldn't be
the main player.
Too much exposure.

469
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:44,361
A middle man?

470
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,168
They didn't all fall by
here by accident either.

471
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:50,480
Where?

472
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:51,686
Can I see this?

473
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,248
Right there.
Where's this?

474
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,285
Yau Ma Tei.

475
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:23,966
Great.

476
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,207
OCTB.

477
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,441
We're running
a surveillance.

478
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,045
On whom?

479
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:56,487
Some Lebanese guy on our
trafficker watch list.

480
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,481
Why'd you let him in?

481
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,248
Well, they want to see if he's
talking to anybody homegrown.

482
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:02,651
Why here?

483
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,801
Every morning he comes
here to meet someone.

484
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,210
Run him down.

485
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,041
Hmm.

486
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,844
Elias Kassar.

487
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:21,049
Fought with
the Christian Phalangists

488
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,009
in the Civil War,
then disappeared.

489
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:27,529
Popped up in the '90s with the
paramilitaries in Colombia.

490
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:30,365
Renting a house
month-to-month in Shek O.

491
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:31,686
Who's he meet?

492
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,765
No one.

493
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,171
No one ever shows.

494
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,570
He texts.

495
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,443
Is your phone an Android?

496
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,563
Can I see it?

497
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,325
Trang.

498
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,170
Bluetooth transmitter.

499
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,402
Short range.
We would never pick it up.

500
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,000
See, they don't
come to meet him.
They come to meet this.

501
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,281
Kassar texts,

502
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:58,964
Wu, Yan and Li walk by.

503
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,849
The receivers in
their pockets pick it up.

504
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,525
They read it, delete it.

505
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:04,489
Kassar never meets them,
never sees them.

506
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,881
No emails.
No phones. No nothing.

507
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:08,241
Slick.

508
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:09,841
Can you crack it?

509
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,081
In about a month.

510
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,924
See, it's locked
in GPG encryption.

511
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,241
So, at least a 512-bit key.

512
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,200
We pick him up,
lean all over him.

513
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:20,726
Or we let him ride and tail
him to the main player.

514
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:21,880
Ah, you don't
have a choice.

515
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:24,521
I mean, this guy's history.
He ain't gonna roll.

516
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,202
I think we let him ride.

517
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:36,806
Yeah.

518
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,769
Sunrise is in two hours.

519
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,003
When this is over,

520
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:08,447
what will you do?

521
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:15,561
I don't know. Fix TVs,
garage door openers.

522
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:20,082
Are you still gonna like me if
I'm fixing garage door openers?

523
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,083
I don't know.
Maybe.

524
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,320
They're moving the money.

525
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,808
All three accounts.

526
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:22,361
Wire transfers
to a Macau casino.

527
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,246
They're cashing out.

528
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:25,765
Surveillance?
Nobody's moved.

529
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:26,887
Kassar?

530
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,360
We can't reach
Yan's team in Shek O.

531
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:31,166
We're going to Shek O.
We're going to Shek O
to pick up Kassar.

532
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,720
Launch STU.
Meet at the heliport.

533
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,609
I'm going to
pick up the mules.

534
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,764
<i>Let's talk about this.</i>

535
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:35,361
<i>I'm not blind.</i>

536
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,204
<i>I know the two of
you are together.</i>

537
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,760
<i>But look at it through my
eyes and what do you see?</i>

538
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:45,323
<i>"Hathaway. Been in prison.
Damaged goods.</i>

539
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,243
<i>"Not much to offer
my sister,</i>

540
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:51,048
<i>"and his future's not
exactly guaranteed,"
is what I'd see.</i>

541
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:53,610
<i>What else?</i>

542
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,841
<i>"She deserves better,"
I'd think, if I was Chen.</i>

543
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:01,487
<i>I've rarely
seen her happier.</i>

544
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:04,124
<i>But what if this fails?</i>

545
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:07,844
<i>Nine more years in prison.
What kind of life
is that for her?</i>

546
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,400
<i>Chen, it's Barrett.</i>

547
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:22,640
I hear you.

548
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:24,967
<i>The mules.
We've got Li and Yan.</i>

549
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,410
And listen,
we can't reach
surveillance in Shek O.

550
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:08,800
Come on. This way.

551
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:19,241
Trang!

552
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,443
Hold on, man! Hold on!

553
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,131
Stay down!

554
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:01,921
Go! Go!

555
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:04,966
Come on.

556
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:10,442
Elias!
Elias, you coming?

557
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:14,569
Come on! Come on!

558
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:18,521
Don't wait!
Drive the barge out of here!

559
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:54,686
Wai.
<i>It's Paul Wang.</i>

560
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:56,922
<i>We were able to restore the
water above the fuel rods</i>

561
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,331
<i>and stabilize the reactor.</i>

562
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,004
<i>It's still hot,
but we can get in.</i>

563
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,365
Nick! Mark!

564
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,768
I still don't get it.
What's he after?

565
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:34,080
And Why this?

566
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:43,690
Hey, what'd she say?

567
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:45,091
Move fast.

568
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:13,770
Wang!

569
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,121
- Wang!
- Hey!

570
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:18,728
Take him!
Both of you,
get out of here!

571
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:30,491
Hathaway...

572
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:05,646
We were right.

573
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:09,247
In the memory dump are the
fragments of the malware.

574
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:11,049
But it's corrupted.

575
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:14,841
Maybe his IP address,
but it's too full of holes.

576
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:29,688
You know, when the Feeb team
busted me in '07 and hit my door,

577
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,683
I was flushing files.

578
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:33,000
But when I came to trial,

579
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:36,880
they retrieved all this data that
should have been irretrievable.

580
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:52,161
Black Widow.
It's NSA software.

581
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:56,165
Examines fragments
and reconstructs originals

582
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:58,561
within a couple of
hours of supercomputing.

583
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:02,807
Big cases like yours,
they loan it to us.

584
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:14,410
<i>Rich, I need access
to Black Widow.</i>

585
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:17,723
Sharing classified
tech with the Chinese?
Are you kidding?

586
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:19,484
That's not even getting
into Hathaway using it.

587
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:22,166
<i>We've committed to
full cooperation, Rich.</i>

588
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:24,402
Yeah, well, you're Justice.
We're NSA.

589
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:27,484
If I wanted to, I can't.
And I don't want to.

590
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:31,004
An unequivocal "No."

591
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:40,281
Okay, so how's it work?
You give NSA the data,
they run it, what?

592
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:43,489
No, they have
a remote login.
We run it.

593
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:45,005
You're not thinking.

594
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:47,367
Come on. They got
the keys to the kingdom.

595
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:48,771
Our guy's address, maybe.

596
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:51,969
Whatever he's cooking up
next is right in there.

597
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:53,963
Only, we can't read it.

598
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:55,846
Let's go.

599
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:06,611
My old correspondence
with Donahue is here.

600
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:08,967
But there's no way that
login is still active.

601
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:10,883
I'm not gonna
use that login.

602
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,401
Okay, Donahue,
the NSA contact you
were just talking with.

603
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:17,245
If NSA discovers
the intrusion...

604
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:18,810
You sure you want
to do this?

605
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:20,962
FBI can't explain
after the fact?

606
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:23,604
You locate this guy,
you're okay.

607
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:26,326
You get discovered,
you're dead meat.

608
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:29,202
You know that,
don't you?

609
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:47,450
The NSA guy
you were talking to,

610
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:49,363
what's his
supervisor's name?

611
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:53,645
Ben Hitchens.

612
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:57,448
Maybe it's better
if the two of you and you

613
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:59,966
aren't around for the next part
so you can deny being here.

614
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:39,121
How do you feel
about this?

615
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:40,201
Not good.

616
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:44,363
It's worse for
the guy in there.

617
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:46,363
I'm surprised
you went along.

618
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:48,761
Washington didn't
see Chai Wan.

619
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:29,761
<i>You asked him
to change his password?</i>

620
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:44,920
When he downloaded
the PDF...

621
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:49,600
...what he downloaded
was the keylogger.

622
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,206
Got it.

623
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:30,330
Now, we wait.

624
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:02,446
We're in.

625
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:10,568
You can call me
"chica" any time you want.

626
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:21,804
This is our actor's
home IP address.
His home server.

627
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:25,282
He's not in Mumbai,
not in Minneapolis, not in Riga.

628
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:26,725
He is in Jakarta.

629
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:27,926
Can you crack the site?

630
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,047
No.

631
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:32,203
Intrarmour's a hosting company
like a hotel or a Swiss bank,

632
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:35,727
exclusively for
black hat hackers,
so it's bulletproof.

633
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:38,485
His server's in there,
but we can't crack the site.

634
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:40,320
All right. So, the move
is strictly low tech.

635
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:41,361
As in...

636
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:43,928
Go to Jakarta,
burglarize the place,

637
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,809
get our hands
on his server.

638
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:48,804
We don't have visas or badges
that work in Indonesia.

639
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:50,564
Can't FBI
get us documented?

640
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:53,405
After the NSA turndown,
I'd stay away from D.C.

641
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:55,403
Then I'll work my side
of the house for entry.

642
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:58,290
That'll take a face-to-face
with my bosses.

643
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:01,089
- All right.
- All right.

644
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:17,251
You getting anywhere?

645
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:19,687
No.
Not into the servers.

646
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:24,882
But I got into
lntrarmour's accounting.

647
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:26,041
Look at this.

648
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:28,691
Charges to our boy's account.
Okay, so?

649
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:32,441
Mmm.
Look at this. $14, $17.

650
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:34,522
Now, $16,400.

651
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:39,247
Five times.
Paid to SatelliteShot.

652
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:41,561
SatelliteShot
rents satellite time.

653
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:43,244
What kind of shot?
This kind.

654
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:47,120
Hi-res scan.

655
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:48,804
Of the coast of Malaysia.

656
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:49,881
What's there?

657
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,490
Nothing much.

658
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:53,369
Why'd he scan there?

659
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:50,401
Shit!

660
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:01,441
This is Barrett.

661
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:04,564
<i>What the hell did you
let go on there, Carol?</i>

662
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:06,680
Pollack?

663
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:08,768
<i>Do you know
what your guy did?</i>

664
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:09,920
What are you talking about?

665
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:10,960
<i>Cut the crap.</i>

666
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,924
I'm talking about calls
I got from the goddamn
NSA and Defense.

667
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,765
Our guy blew
a reactor at Chai Wan.

668
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:17,841
Don't you watch CNN?

669
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:19,610
That's not the point.

670
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:20,927
<i>That's not the point.</i>

671
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:23,168
That's exactly the point.

672
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:25,208
The guy we're working
will drop the big hammer

673
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:26,441
and not think twice
about it.

674
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:28,921
Come on, come on, come on.
Don't evoke 9/11 on me.

675
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:32,200
You didn't lose
anyone there, Stanley.

676
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:35,925
Look, I'm under orders.
Now, so are you.

677
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,401
Bring him in, Carol.
Bring him in.

678
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:46,250
What's going on?

679
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:50,251
Damn it! Hathaway's gone.

680
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:51,970
Hey. This says he's here.

681
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:53,771
He cut his bracelet?

682
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:55,126
He can't.
It signals an alarm.

683
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:56,401
This says it's working.

684
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:57,561
Check your settings.

685
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:09,489
He reset it to
once every 24 hours.

686
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:12,002
We haven't been
tracking him since LA.

687
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:13,081
They're at
Cheung Hau Street.

688
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:14,286
Shit.

689
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:21,921
Hey.

690
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:33,731
They're coming for you.

691
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:37,329
They're coming for you
because of Black Widow.

692
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:38,890
That was fast.

693
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:42,043
They want me to turn you
over to the Americans.

694
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:47,529
So, turn me in
and walk away.

695
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,728
And then,
Barrett and Jessup will back me up.

696
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:51,086
NSA won't care.

697
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:54,448
They think because of you,
now we have Black Widow.

698
01:23:56,640 --> 01:23:58,529
You have to run.

699
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:00,805
What? You're gonna
refuse an order?

700
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:02,485
You escaped.

701
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:04,729
We reconnect in Jakarta.

702
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:06,723
Look, your bosses
can add two and two.

703
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:08,131
I'm not turning you in.

704
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:13,122
Do I go with you or Nick?

705
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:15,240
Neither.

706
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:17,288
- What?
- This doesn't involve you.

707
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:19,727
Who made that choice?

708
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:20,847
He's right.

709
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:29,009
Look, I'm not sure there's any light
at the end of this tunnel anymore.

710
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:34,565
What did you do,
Chen Dawai?

711
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:36,722
Remind him
he owes you?

712
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:38,968
To get him
to leave me behind?

713
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:41,564
You're not going
down that road.

714
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:43,842
I decide what's for me!

715
01:24:45,320 --> 01:24:46,970
Yeah, well, I decide
what's for me.

716
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:48,929
I'm going. You're not.

717
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:55,607
Right now,
we need our data.

718
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:04,365
Here.
You take the car.

719
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:07,125
You may have to move faster.

720
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:09,885
I'll bring the hard drive
to Quarry Bay.

721
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:17,449
He's in Kowloon.
Right here.

722
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:21,246
You're gonna take
him into custody?

723
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:24,006
I follow orders.

724
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:25,320
Which orders?

725
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:28,051
Stop the bad guys,
or arrest Hathaway?

726
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:32,204
I'm gonna ask you
a personal question.

727
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:35,284
Don't answer if
you don't want to.

728
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:37,289
Who did you lose in 9/11?

729
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:38,970
My husband.

730
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:19,522
You got to get rid
of that thing.

731
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:21,602
We got a couple of hours.

732
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:35,961
Hold it. Hold it.

733
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:39,128
He's on the move again.
He's in Hong Kong.

734
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:40,281
Quarry Bay.

735
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:42,971
Where?
He's headed toward Quarry Bay.

736
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:13,481
I thought you were
going separately.

737
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:15,130
Nick's taking
a small plane.

738
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:16,725
I'm flying commercial.

739
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:18,404
Sister, go home.

740
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:25,810
You did this.

741
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:37,685
All right, let's go.

742
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:41,445
Lien!

743
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:43,045
Hold up! Stop.

744
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:44,120
What?
Hold up. Hold up!

745
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:45,161
What?
Stop.

746
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:46,361
What?
Listen!

747
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:48,204
I'm a fugitive now!

748
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:52,326
They'll issue
the warrant within hours!

749
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:57,326
Hey.

750
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:02,601
Would I take you
where I'm going?

751
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:24,762
Don't blame your brother.

752
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:11,250
No!

753
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:28,010
Go, go, go!

754
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:55,880
Barrett!

755
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:37,845
Lien, can they get
to the next stop

756
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:39,331
before the train?

757
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:41,084
Listen, we gotta
grieve later, okay?

758
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:42,161
We have to survive.

759
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:45,323
Can they get to the next
stop before the train?

760
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:49,289
No, they can't.

761
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:51,651
Okay, Okay.

762
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:59,204
We're both
going after them!

763
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:01,930
We're both going.

764
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:03,851
Yes, we are.

765
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:06,761
We are.

766
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:12,724
Perak, Malaysia.

767
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:20,168
Coordinates
are right here.

768
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:28,805
Here. Right here.
Looked at this.

769
01:36:31,120 --> 01:36:33,600
He's got $74 million
in cash, he's writing code.

770
01:36:33,680 --> 01:36:34,920
What for?

771
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:37,527
What's here?

772
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:43,000
You got Dean Palm Oil,
Pera Limited Mining.

773
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:45,962
Agriculture... Jesus.

774
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:36,042
Hey, this pump,
it's a Stasik pump.

775
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:49,165
They use
the same model

776
01:37:49,240 --> 01:37:50,890
Stasik water pumps
as Chai Wan reactor.

777
01:37:52,440 --> 01:37:55,205
The same brand.
Are they controlled
by the same PLCs?

778
01:37:55,680 --> 01:37:56,681
Yes.

779
01:37:56,760 --> 01:37:58,125
What are they
mining over there?

780
01:37:58,640 --> 01:37:59,880
Pera Limited.

781
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:02,682
Mining tin.
Tin?

782
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:04,444
Malaysia is one of
the biggest exporters.

783
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:08,891
And there's four other tin mining
operations in the next valley.

784
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:15,887
This is a riverbed.

785
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:18,486
They divert water
with Stasik pumps.

786
01:38:20,440 --> 01:38:22,647
You know why
Chai Wan reactor?

787
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:26,563
We've been looking through the
looking glass the wrong way.

788
01:38:26,640 --> 01:38:29,086
He didn't target the reactor
to knock out the reactor.

789
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:31,288
He targeted it to
knock out the pumps.

790
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:34,081
He was rehearsing.
It was a rehearsal.

791
01:38:34,440 --> 01:38:36,602
Chai Wan was a rehearsal.

792
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:39,371
He's going to shut down these
pumps and flood the tin mine,

793
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:41,090
and the valleys,
and the villages,

794
01:38:41,160 --> 01:38:43,083
village people,
village dogs.

795
01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:46,846
Create a shortage in tin.
Tin prices will rise and shoot up.

796
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:51,206
His $74 million from Chicago
was to buy options on tin ore.

797
01:38:55,160 --> 01:38:58,846
That's what you're doing.
Isn't it, you son of a bitch?

798
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:50,606
All right,
look at this.

799
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:53,645
A third version
of his virus, running more PLCs.

800
01:43:55,720 --> 01:43:57,245
Fifty-three...

801
01:43:58,360 --> 01:44:00,203
Fifty-three PLCs.

802
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:03,766
Five different tin mines.

803
01:44:03,880 --> 01:44:07,043
For which he's going to
flood five river valleys.

804
01:44:10,760 --> 01:44:12,524
Here's the money
from Chicago.

805
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:16,163
$73.6 million
in cash,

806
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:17,890
deposited into
a local bank.

807
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:20,122
Bank Sentra Agatis.

808
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:11,404
To this address.

809
01:45:43,960 --> 01:45:45,121
Hi.
Hello.

810
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:46,964
Excuse me, I'm sorry.
Can you speak English?

811
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:48,451
A little.
Okay.

812
01:45:48,520 --> 01:45:50,204
I'm here to have
a meeting with

813
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:53,130
Mr. Jumhari in five minutes.

814
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:55,809
Go to the reception
on the third floor.

815
01:45:56,920 --> 01:45:58,729
Yeah, I know, but

816
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:01,770
can you help me?
My presentation got stained.

817
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:06,442
Any chance,
can you print me a new copy,
please?

818
01:46:06,520 --> 01:46:08,090
Not supposed to, but...

819
01:47:25,200 --> 01:47:26,645
So?

820
01:47:26,720 --> 01:47:28,051
Home run.

821
01:48:54,920 --> 01:48:57,048
<i>You got my message.</i>

822
01:48:57,120 --> 01:49:00,567
Why are you here?
You tell me, what do you want?

823
01:49:00,640 --> 01:49:03,405
I am not gonna talk
to a fucking bagman.

824
01:49:03,480 --> 01:49:06,563
Here's the terms.
Phones only. No face-to-face.

825
01:49:06,640 --> 01:49:08,051
<i>You got that? Good.</i>

826
01:49:08,120 --> 01:49:10,964
<i>Next, your boss on
the line with me in 15.</i>

827
01:49:14,640 --> 01:49:15,926
That's not possible.

828
01:49:16,840 --> 01:49:18,649
I have $74 million
of his money.

829
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:20,324
You make it possible.

830
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:48,966
Yeah.

831
01:49:50,280 --> 01:49:52,487
Your note said
that you know me,
but I don't know you.

832
01:49:52,560 --> 01:49:55,131
But that's not really true,
is it, Hathaway?

833
01:49:55,200 --> 01:49:58,090
<i>Yeah? I know you.</i>

834
01:49:58,160 --> 01:49:59,400
Ah, you do?

835
01:50:00,040 --> 01:50:02,566
<i>Well, that makes one of us.</i>

836
01:50:02,640 --> 01:50:03,960
<i>Sometimes I wake
up in the morning</i>

837
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:05,206
<i>and I don't
even know who I am.</i>

838
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:07,966
Where I am. In what country.

839
01:50:10,040 --> 01:50:12,611
<i>And you know me?</i>

840
01:50:12,680 --> 01:50:13,806
I know you,

841
01:50:13,880 --> 01:50:15,211
<i>and you're about money</i>

842
01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:17,965
<i>because it's your scoreboard
in the virtual world.</i>

843
01:50:18,040 --> 01:50:19,530
You found me.

844
01:50:20,680 --> 01:50:21,761
What do you want?

845
01:50:23,200 --> 01:50:24,884
I want to be
Casper the Ghost.

846
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:28,250
Don't you have a job,
working yourself out of prison?

847
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:29,924
<i>It was kind of a bad fit.</i>

848
01:50:30,280 --> 01:50:32,203
<i>You're looking
for employment?</i>

849
01:50:32,280 --> 01:50:33,805
What do I want
employment for?

850
01:50:33,880 --> 01:50:36,167
<i>Oh, you want a piece?</i>

851
01:50:36,240 --> 01:50:39,369
To put yourself
back into the game?

852
01:50:39,440 --> 01:50:40,771
You were never
in the game.

853
01:50:40,840 --> 01:50:42,365
You're a glorified carder.

854
01:50:42,440 --> 01:50:43,805
A carder whose
time is expired.

855
01:50:43,880 --> 01:50:46,167
Check your expiration date.
Your shelf life is over.

856
01:50:46,240 --> 01:50:48,971
A glorified carder
holding your $74 million.

857
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:52,044
Okay, last time.
What do you want?

858
01:50:52,120 --> 01:50:54,851
I want 20% of
the Malaysian tin ore hit.

859
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:01,210
<i>For releasing my money?</i>

860
01:51:01,280 --> 01:51:02,770
No, for renting you my code.

861
01:51:02,840 --> 01:51:05,764
It's my action that gave
that code you wrote meaning.

862
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:08,241
What's it mean
without a bankroll?

863
01:51:13,080 --> 01:51:14,161
You want to be my partner?

864
01:51:14,240 --> 01:51:17,847
<i>It's 20%. You call
it whatever you want.</i>

865
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:19,126
I meet my partners.

866
01:51:23,640 --> 01:51:24,766
Well, I don't.

867
01:51:24,840 --> 01:51:27,081
And like I told your bagman,
I don't want to meet.

868
01:51:27,200 --> 01:51:29,931
<i>I don't give a fuck
about what you want.</i>

869
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:34,601
It's what I want
when I make a deal,
face-to-face.

870
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:40,927
Because I can put
together another bankroll.
Target another target.

871
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,048
And if I stop thinking
about you,

872
01:51:44,200 --> 01:51:46,168
if I stop thinking
about anything,

873
01:51:47,400 --> 01:51:51,121
it disappears. It vanishes.
It ceases to exist.

874
01:51:55,520 --> 01:51:57,409
But you...

875
01:51:57,520 --> 01:51:59,522
You, I want to meet.

876
01:51:59,600 --> 01:52:02,206
Or you can piss off
and die, Ghostman.

877
01:52:09,760 --> 01:52:10,886
All right, you and Kassar.

878
01:52:11,160 --> 01:52:13,561
<i>I'll call you
and tell you where.</i>

879
01:52:13,640 --> 01:52:14,880
Sure.

880
01:52:24,520 --> 01:52:26,090
Okay. We're on.

881
01:52:47,160 --> 01:52:48,844
Emergency! Please.

882
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:51,722
It's all about if I can get
close enough fast enough.

883
01:54:33,800 --> 01:54:36,644
<i>Hey, I told you.
You and Kassar, alone.</i>

884
01:54:40,120 --> 01:54:41,724
Five men,
two floors below.

885
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:45,328
<i>The team
two floors below.</i>

886
01:54:46,640 --> 01:54:48,449
And two gunmen
with them.

887
01:54:48,520 --> 01:54:50,568
<i>And the two guys
with you?</i>

888
01:54:51,760 --> 01:54:54,491
<i>Lose them.
I'm changing the location.</i>

889
01:54:55,320 --> 01:55:00,406
<i>You and Kassar,
Papua Square. Walk west.
Meet me in two hours.</i>

890
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:03,290
It'll be packed.
How am I supposed to find you?

891
01:55:03,360 --> 01:55:05,169
<i>I find you.</i>

892
01:58:00,640 --> 01:58:02,005
Step back. Hands up.

893
01:58:02,080 --> 01:58:03,844
Hands up, hands up.

894
01:58:05,040 --> 01:58:06,769
Hands up. Turn around.

895
01:58:07,440 --> 01:58:08,851
Turn around!

896
01:58:22,320 --> 01:58:25,005
No one's ever gotten
this close before.

897
01:59:24,200 --> 01:59:26,806
20% is too much, Hathaway.

898
01:59:26,880 --> 01:59:28,484
You talking points?

899
01:59:29,120 --> 01:59:31,964
Well, people die on
this planet every day.

900
01:59:32,600 --> 01:59:35,331
What do you want me to do?
Grieve? Because I knew him?

901
01:59:35,400 --> 01:59:37,687
He's not here anymore.

902
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:39,046
Where's my money?

903
01:59:39,120 --> 01:59:40,770
Not about money.

904
01:59:43,760 --> 01:59:48,209
Not about zeroes
or ones or code.

905
01:59:48,280 --> 01:59:49,486
And what's that tell you?

906
01:59:49,560 --> 01:59:51,005
Get out of the way!

907
01:59:51,120 --> 01:59:52,690
I'm a gamer.

908
01:59:52,760 --> 01:59:55,206
I hire people to do
sub-symbolic stuff.

909
01:59:55,280 --> 01:59:57,726
You killed my friends.
I do my own.

910
01:59:57,800 --> 01:59:59,006
And do I care?

911
02:02:13,080 --> 02:02:14,127
The Betadine.

912
02:02:15,560 --> 02:02:16,721
Here.

913
02:02:32,400 --> 02:02:34,209
I got it.
Okay.

914
02:02:37,320 --> 02:02:38,924
This one?
Yeah.

915
02:02:40,080 --> 02:02:41,445
That's good. It's good.

916
02:02:42,280 --> 02:02:43,520
Okay.
