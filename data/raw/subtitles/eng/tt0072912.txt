1
00:02:31,528 --> 00:02:32,195
Hmm.

2
00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:33,403
Surprised?

3
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,491
You betcha.

4
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:38,868
In your telegram, you said
Mrs. James Devereaux.

5
00:02:39,077 --> 00:02:41,871
That's who I've been
for the last 17 years.

6
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,122
You never told me.

7
00:02:43,123 --> 00:02:44,249
You never asked.

8
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:46,251
Why are we whispering?

9
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:50,004
Shh. Come back over here.

10
00:02:56,261 --> 00:02:57,470
Wait a minute.
Hold it.

11
00:02:59,722 --> 00:03:01,141
Boy, you look terrific.

12
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:02,517
So do you.

13
00:03:03,268 --> 00:03:04,519
Except you got
a little...

14
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:06,437
Gray over your ears.

15
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,064
It's the only difference.

16
00:03:08,565 --> 00:03:10,483
Everything else
works about the same.

17
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:16,531
It was six years ago.

18
00:03:18,408 --> 00:03:22,453
That really was a voluptuous
week, wasn't it?

19
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,290
Yeah. Aside from
the good times,

20
00:03:25,498 --> 00:03:27,333
you didn't give away much,
though, did you?

21
00:03:29,586 --> 00:03:30,879
Why did you drop us
like that?

22
00:03:31,087 --> 00:03:33,007
I turned around to wind
my watch and turned back,

23
00:03:33,089 --> 00:03:34,841
and you'd slipped
out of L.A.

24
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:37,719
It was time to go home.

25
00:03:38,553 --> 00:03:40,930
So why was I
flown down here,

26
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:42,849
for sport or business?

27
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:45,685
No. For business.
Strictly business.

28
00:03:45,894 --> 00:03:47,061
Remember you told me

29
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,272
that if I ever had
any real trouble...

30
00:03:49,606 --> 00:03:50,606
Uh-huh. Well...

31
00:03:55,904 --> 00:03:57,113
Oh, good god.

32
00:03:57,655 --> 00:03:58,655
Oh.

33
00:04:02,994 --> 00:04:04,204
Is he looking at me?

34
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:07,582
I think he was a little
more interested in me.

35
00:04:10,877 --> 00:04:13,338
Listen, I've made
a reservation for you here

36
00:04:13,546 --> 00:04:14,714
at the town house.

37
00:04:14,881 --> 00:04:16,507
My telephone number
is right there,

38
00:04:16,716 --> 00:04:17,717
inside the cover.

39
00:04:17,926 --> 00:04:20,845
Now, you call me tomorrow.
All right?

40
00:05:46,681 --> 00:05:48,099
The door was unlocked.

41
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:50,935
It still is, kid.
Out.

42
00:05:51,477 --> 00:05:53,646
Come on, Lew.
Give me a break.

43
00:05:54,314 --> 00:05:55,582
That's either
an awful good guess,

44
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:56,606
or you're a cop.

45
00:05:56,983 --> 00:05:59,360
Swimming's an O.K. Way
to relax...

46
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:02,697
But I know a better way.

47
00:06:04,324 --> 00:06:05,783
All right,
that's enough.

48
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:07,409
Now, who
the hell are you,

49
00:06:07,577 --> 00:06:08,828
and how'd you
know my name?

50
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:13,833
Don't you think
I'm kind of sexy?

51
00:06:14,042 --> 00:06:16,169
Yeah, I think
you're kind of sexy,

52
00:06:16,836 --> 00:06:18,838
but I'm not gonna spend
the 200th anniversary

53
00:06:19,047 --> 00:06:20,465
of this great
and glorious country

54
00:06:20,673 --> 00:06:21,466
of ours in the slammer.

55
00:06:21,674 --> 00:06:22,842
Come on. Out.

56
00:06:23,051 --> 00:06:24,571
I never had anyone
turn me down before.

57
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:26,804
There's a first time
for everything, kid.

58
00:06:31,351 --> 00:06:32,560
I'm sorry about that.

59
00:06:33,102 --> 00:06:34,102
No, you're not.

60
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:36,731
You're right.
I'm not.

61
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:38,316
Now, come on. Out.

62
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:56,542
Grab the paint.

63
00:06:57,043 --> 00:06:58,043
What the hell
are you...

64
00:06:58,127 --> 00:07:00,755
Listen, you keep your
goddamn mouth shut, mister.

65
00:07:08,346 --> 00:07:09,680
You want to make
a statement?

66
00:07:12,934 --> 00:07:14,102
Now, you listen.

67
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:17,563
I can fix it so you won't
get no pleasure pissin'.

68
00:07:17,814 --> 00:07:19,399
Nobody'll ever
find a mark.

69
00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:21,149
Really.

70
00:07:23,027 --> 00:07:24,445
Now, let me see.

71
00:07:25,488 --> 00:07:26,488
We got child
molestation,

72
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:27,365
statu...

73
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:28,741
Oh, come on.

74
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,076
Statutory rape,

75
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,245
indecent exposure,
resisting arrest,

76
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:33,950
carrying
a concealed weapon.

77
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,248
I got a permit.

78
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:37,375
Not in Louisiana,
you haven't.

79
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,377
Chief, this here
is Harper.

80
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:41,379
Thank you, lieutenant.
I know who he is.

81
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:43,214
And Harper thinks
he is bright.

82
00:07:43,423 --> 00:07:44,674
I'll take it from here.

83
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,968
Yes, sir.

84
00:07:56,644 --> 00:07:58,764
Lieutenant Franks gets
overenthusiastic now and again.

85
00:08:00,773 --> 00:08:02,213
I just called you in
for questioning.

86
00:08:04,861 --> 00:08:06,362
What the hell does he do
for a living?

87
00:08:09,866 --> 00:08:10,866
Tell me something.

88
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:12,910
What do you private
detectives get these days?

89
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:14,370
150 per.

90
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:15,579
A day?

91
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:17,039
And expenses.

92
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:19,625
Whew.
That's a lot of money.

93
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:21,669
Not if you only work
4 days a year, it ain't.

94
00:08:23,171 --> 00:08:24,338
What's the beef?

95
00:08:24,547 --> 00:08:26,090
Well, the beef
is that you were seen

96
00:08:26,299 --> 00:08:28,593
in a state
of undress in a motel room

97
00:08:28,801 --> 00:08:29,802
with an underage girl.

98
00:08:30,011 --> 00:08:30,678
Who did the seeing?

99
00:08:30,887 --> 00:08:31,887
I did.

100
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,974
I guess a whole lot
doesn't happen in this town

101
00:08:35,183 --> 00:08:36,303
without you knowing
about it.

102
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,603
Mister, you don't belch
without me knowing about it.

103
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,938
She let herself in.

104
00:08:43,191 --> 00:08:45,735
Hey, I may be horny,
but I'm not stupid.

105
00:08:49,197 --> 00:08:50,531
You down here
working on a case?

106
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:51,990
Yeah.

107
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:54,827
Employed by who,
and what for?

108
00:08:55,453 --> 00:08:57,121
The what for
is confidential.

109
00:08:57,622 --> 00:08:59,081
The who
is a Mrs. Devereaux.

110
00:09:02,168 --> 00:09:03,461
Olivia Devereaux?

111
00:09:04,045 --> 00:09:05,338
No. Iris.

112
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:07,672
Do you know her?

113
00:09:08,007 --> 00:09:09,300
Yeah. Sure. Sure. Sure.

114
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:11,427
That family has a lot
of pull around here.

115
00:09:12,762 --> 00:09:13,888
Where do you
know her from?

116
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:16,098
Ohh, confidential.

117
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:17,725
I'd sure like to know

118
00:09:17,934 --> 00:09:19,769
what the hell she'd need
a private peeper for.

119
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:21,686
Well, I can't say.

120
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:23,481
I mean, it's the ethics
of the profession.

121
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:26,359
Feel left out?

122
00:09:32,532 --> 00:09:33,991
One... I believe you
about the girl,

123
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,368
at least for now.

124
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:36,911
Now,
that doesn't mean

125
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:38,263
that I can't
throw you in jail

126
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:39,607
and let you fight
it out in court.

127
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:41,082
Now, you sense
where I'm going?

128
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,417
I'm picking up signs.

129
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,294
2... I'm keeping
your weapon.

130
00:09:45,503 --> 00:09:47,046
It violates
our local gun policy.

131
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:48,774
I don't want you
shooting up the place.

132
00:09:48,798 --> 00:09:50,091
OK.

133
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:52,176
3... don't give
me any of that

134
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:53,928
west coast snot-ass
bullshit.

135
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:55,388
Now, we may talk

136
00:09:55,555 --> 00:09:56,973
a little
different down here,

137
00:09:57,181 --> 00:09:58,182
but...

138
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,685
We ain't stupid, either.

139
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:07,108
I hear
what you're saying.

140
00:10:07,275 --> 00:10:08,901
That's good.
That's good.

141
00:10:25,668 --> 00:10:28,504
And one more thing there,
Harper.

142
00:10:28,713 --> 00:10:30,590
If anything untoward
should happen to Iris

143
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:32,133
or her daughter Schuyler,

144
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:34,051
I'd like to hear
about it first.

145
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,012
I take a strong interest

146
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,805
in the welfare
of those two, you hear?

147
00:10:38,014 --> 00:10:39,014
Sure.

148
00:11:53,214 --> 00:11:54,214
Hi. Lew Harper.

149
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,717
Mrs. James Devereaux
is expecting me.

150
00:11:56,926 --> 00:11:59,053
Yes. I'll tell
Mrs. Devereaux you're here.

151
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:40,511
All I said was that the opening
is a little flowery.

152
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,722
Well, damn it, at least
give it a fair reading.

153
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:46,559
Why don't you indulge yourself
in another drink?

154
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:49,145
It might help create
the atmosphere for your...

155
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:51,021
Your artistry.

156
00:12:51,272 --> 00:12:53,983
The one indulgence
I have never had is privacy.

157
00:12:58,154 --> 00:13:01,031
It just isn't very good,
I'm afraid.

158
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:03,868
Mrs. Devereaux.

159
00:13:04,702 --> 00:13:05,411
Yes.

160
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,163
There's a gentleman here
to see you.

161
00:13:08,372 --> 00:13:09,372
Thank you.

162
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,695
I don't know
where to start.

163
00:13:41,197 --> 00:13:43,282
Why don't you start where
you stopped yesterday?

164
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,331
I'm frightened, Lew.

165
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:51,957
That's a good place.

166
00:13:56,921 --> 00:13:58,714
Hey, you're not running off
again, are you?

167
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:17,858
"Mr. James Devereaux."

168
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:24,447
"Dear Mr. Devereaux.

169
00:14:24,532 --> 00:14:28,244
Lilies that fester smell
far worse than weeds."

170
00:14:36,502 --> 00:14:37,962
"The deceived husband.

171
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,506
"So love's face may
still seem love to you,

172
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,174
"though altered anew.

173
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:44,635
"Do you enjoy playing
the cuckold,

174
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:47,137
"or are you unaware

175
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:49,348
of your wife's
amorous activity?"

176
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:53,310
Well, it's
an old portable

177
00:14:53,811 --> 00:14:54,895
with a flaky "E."

178
00:14:55,104 --> 00:14:56,230
Interesting style,

179
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,440
if I remember my
high school lit class.

180
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:00,484
Mailed right here
in Rivage.

181
00:15:00,693 --> 00:15:01,944
<i>Rivage.</i>

182
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:03,848
Does your husband
know about this?

183
00:15:04,363 --> 00:15:06,699
No. He wasn't at home
when the mail arrived.

184
00:15:07,116 --> 00:15:09,326
You usually read
his mail?

185
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:11,787
We read each other's mail.

186
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:16,750
What does he do
for a living?

187
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,377
Writes unproduced plays.

188
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,004
Between drinks.

189
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:21,797
Where does all this
come from?

190
00:15:22,006 --> 00:15:24,133
Oh, this all belongs
to his mother.

191
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:30,055
Olivia's family has owned
Beau Rivage for 175 years.

192
00:15:31,557 --> 00:15:35,185
The abolition of slavery was
a mild agitation for them.

193
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:37,605
How did you slip in?

194
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:40,608
Oh, born into the lace.

195
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,985
Good blood, no money.

196
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:45,529
One becomes accustomed
to style.

197
00:15:48,449 --> 00:15:50,576
Is that the old lady,
Olivia?

198
00:15:52,745 --> 00:15:53,871
What's she
doing out there,

199
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,122
changing the guard?

200
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:58,500
She has an iron clamp
around this house.

201
00:16:00,252 --> 00:16:01,420
Do you know
that she keeps us

202
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:03,422
on allowances
like adolescents?

203
00:16:03,631 --> 00:16:06,008
If she ever got hold
of that letter...

204
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:10,554
I can manage James.
It's mama that scares me.

205
00:16:10,763 --> 00:16:12,556
She'd make my life
a nightmare.

206
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:14,307
Do you?

207
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:16,059
Do I what?

208
00:16:17,061 --> 00:16:18,479
Enjoy connubial bliss

209
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,564
outside the bounds of
holy matrimony?

210
00:16:22,441 --> 00:16:25,277
That's an unusual question
for you to ask.

211
00:16:25,486 --> 00:16:26,612
That's my business.

212
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,991
The marriage hasn't worked
for some years now.

213
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:32,826
Why don't you
just break it off?

214
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:35,955
And do what?

215
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:38,831
And...

216
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,131
Where do you think
this all came from?

217
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,927
It came from Pat Reavis.

218
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:51,553
Who is he?

219
00:16:52,763 --> 00:16:54,348
He was the family
chauffeur...

220
00:16:54,765 --> 00:16:57,017
Until I fired him
a few days ago.

221
00:16:57,518 --> 00:17:00,020
That letter came in the mail
the next morning.

222
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,856
Did you have a fling
with him?

223
00:17:05,818 --> 00:17:08,696
No, I did not have a fling
with the family chauffeur.

224
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:13,534
What do you
want me to do?

225
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,580
I want you
to make him stop.

226
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:21,166
I do not want
any more letters.

227
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,375
I don't know
what to say.

228
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:23,543
I'll take a run at it.

229
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:27,881
Iris...

230
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:29,090
Why couldn't...

231
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:30,216
Thank you.

232
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:40,978
Where do I find
this Reavis fellow?

233
00:17:41,145 --> 00:17:42,938
I don't know
where he lives.

234
00:17:43,439 --> 00:17:45,315
He used to work
for Kilbourne Oil.

235
00:17:45,524 --> 00:17:46,584
Maybe he's gone back there.

236
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:48,652
You shouldn't have any trouble
finding that place.

237
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:51,947
Oh, have you met
my daughter?

238
00:17:53,741 --> 00:17:56,201
Schuyler, this is
Mr. Harper. He's, uh...

239
00:17:56,577 --> 00:17:58,287
Exterminator.
Dixie pest control.

240
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:00,372
How do you do,
Mr. Harper?

241
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:02,499
Oh, sometimes I do better
than others.

242
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:03,959
Well, I hope so.

243
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:08,297
Do we have a problem?

244
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:10,299
That's what I'm here
to find out.

245
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:12,926
I generally start
in the servants' quarters.

246
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:15,304
You know... the cook,
the maid, the chauffeur.

247
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:16,680
Oh, yes, the chauffeur

248
00:18:16,889 --> 00:18:18,891
used to live
over the garage.

249
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:20,309
It's right around there.

250
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:21,310
Mm-hmm.

251
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:22,936
Exterminator?

252
00:18:23,729 --> 00:18:24,729
Trust me.

253
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:26,355
Can I help you?

254
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:28,734
No, thanks, but I'll
keep it in mind.

255
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:28,937
It's quite a zoo
you got here.

256
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:31,166
Do you think
you could introduce me

257
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,274
to the head keeper?

258
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:36,153
Hmph, right on.
Come on.

259
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:41,491
Thanks for not saying
anything to mother

260
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,910
about the town house.

261
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:44,995
How'd you know
I'd even be there?

262
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:47,331
I heard her
making a reservation.

263
00:20:47,915 --> 00:20:50,167
You read
your mama's mail, too?

264
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:52,920
Why did she book
a room for you?

265
00:20:53,128 --> 00:20:54,128
I'm up
from New Orleans.

266
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:55,339
She didn't like
the local.

267
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:57,007
Oh, come on.

268
00:20:57,216 --> 00:20:58,550
No, no kidding.
Pest control.

269
00:20:59,134 --> 00:21:01,011
What are you really
up here for?

270
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,806
Insurance.

271
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:06,475
What's Pat Reavis
really like?

272
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:16,109
He was fun.

273
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:19,988
Mild psychopaths often are
if you don't cross them.

274
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:28,163
Like I said, you're
a pretty bright kid.

275
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,707
I guess I have
my daddy's genes.

276
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:31,916
Grandmother?

277
00:21:32,376 --> 00:21:33,460
Grandmother?

278
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:35,963
This is Mr. Harper.

279
00:21:36,255 --> 00:21:39,883
He's here to check over
the house for... Pests.

280
00:21:40,884 --> 00:21:43,929
Schuyler, you may bring me
a glass of Sherry.

281
00:21:46,098 --> 00:21:47,516
Yes, grandmother.

282
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:09,079
Ma'am, you got
a zebra Finch over there

283
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:10,288
with a discolored beak.

284
00:22:10,414 --> 00:22:11,832
You ought to wash it off
in vinegar.

285
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,960
Stems from
a protein deficiency.

286
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:21,758
Uh... Mrs... uh...

287
00:22:24,094 --> 00:22:25,095
James Devereaux

288
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:29,599
called our New Orleans
representative,

289
00:22:29,808 --> 00:22:31,101
and, uh...

290
00:22:31,268 --> 00:22:34,104
Mr. Harper, that is
quite enough of that.

291
00:22:34,313 --> 00:22:35,939
You can tell
Mr. Kilbourne

292
00:22:36,148 --> 00:22:37,733
my answer is no...

293
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:40,485
And will remain so
for as long as I live.

294
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:45,782
Well, uh, yes, ma'am,
I'll be happy to.

295
00:22:45,991 --> 00:22:47,311
Just tell me
where I can find him.

296
00:22:48,452 --> 00:22:52,080
Mr. Harper, I can do
without the charades.

297
00:22:52,748 --> 00:22:56,668
Mr. Kilbourne is forever
trying these tiresome tactics,

298
00:22:56,877 --> 00:22:59,421
and he's a rank amateur.

299
00:23:02,174 --> 00:23:03,175
This is going to come

300
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:04,703
as something
of a surprise, ma'am,

301
00:23:04,843 --> 00:23:06,595
but I don't work
for Mr. Kilbourne.

302
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:08,643
In fact, I don't even...
I don't even know him.

303
00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:12,351
I detest you big oil
company "yes" men.

304
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:14,019
I'm not a yes company...

305
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:17,939
Quiet! You oil people
have ruined our town,

306
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:19,524
destroyed our parish,

307
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:23,195
and I'll not allow you
to populate my land.

308
00:23:23,445 --> 00:23:25,697
Go...
Now leave my property!

309
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:29,159
And tell your employer
Jay hue Kilbourne

310
00:23:29,368 --> 00:23:30,494
to go to hell!

311
00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:33,955
Yes, ma'am.

312
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:35,582
I see what you mean.

313
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:37,071
She's a functioning
ball-breaker.

314
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:38,794
Did you find anything?

315
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:40,087
Enough to get started.

316
00:23:45,884 --> 00:23:47,886
Is that your friend
from the French quarter?

317
00:23:48,095 --> 00:23:49,554
Oh, that's Peter.

318
00:23:49,763 --> 00:23:52,724
He's helping James with
his creative endeavors.

319
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:55,602
O.K.

320
00:23:58,897 --> 00:24:00,232
Uh...

321
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,567
Well, where were we?

322
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:05,654
I found that old portable
with the flaky "e."

323
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:08,022
But I hope this guy Reavis
can be pretty easily conned.

324
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:10,409
This ain't exactly what
I'd call heavy ammunition.

325
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:15,664
Well, what else
can you do?

326
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,872
I don't know.

327
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,393
Try to find him,
hit him with this,

328
00:24:18,417 --> 00:24:19,709
and hope
it scares him off.

329
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,545
It ain't easy

330
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:24,589
standing around
talking shop with you.

331
00:24:26,174 --> 00:24:27,342
No. I'm finding it
difficult

332
00:24:27,551 --> 00:24:30,637
to adjust
to the sight of you.

333
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:32,639
Were you angry

334
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:35,142
when I left Los Angeles
so suddenly?

335
00:24:35,392 --> 00:24:36,392
I'd have been angry

336
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:38,061
if it had never
happened at all.

337
00:24:47,737 --> 00:24:50,323
Iris, you are wearing
my gardening hat again.

338
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:52,909
I would be so grateful,

339
00:24:53,118 --> 00:24:54,578
so everlastingly grateful,

340
00:24:54,786 --> 00:24:57,330
if in future
you would ask my permission.

341
00:24:57,914 --> 00:24:58,914
Yes, mother.

342
00:25:04,045 --> 00:25:06,006
I could kill
that bitch!

343
00:25:58,475 --> 00:25:59,893
Hey, excuse me.

344
00:26:00,435 --> 00:26:02,646
Can I talk to you
a minute?

345
00:26:02,854 --> 00:26:03,980
Sure.

346
00:26:04,189 --> 00:26:05,416
I thought you might
be interested

347
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,775
in taking
a little ride...

348
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,693
You know,
around the city.

349
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:10,237
I don't think
I got the time.

350
00:26:15,534 --> 00:26:16,826
Right up front,

351
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:19,246
I am required by law
to advise you guys

352
00:26:19,454 --> 00:26:20,789
that my hands
are registered

353
00:26:20,997 --> 00:26:22,165
in the state
of California

354
00:26:22,374 --> 00:26:24,084
as lethal weapons.
You understand?

355
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:26,419
Oh, really?
A black belt, huh?

356
00:26:26,628 --> 00:26:27,796
You betcha.

357
00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:29,548
Glo, show him yours.

358
00:26:34,386 --> 00:26:35,804
Well, that's
a different ball game.

359
00:26:36,596 --> 00:26:38,098
I was just...
I was just kidding.

360
00:26:38,306 --> 00:26:39,432
I'm a brown belt,
actually.

361
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:40,721
Where do you
want me to sit?

362
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:41,809
You want
front or back?

363
00:26:41,851 --> 00:26:42,851
Back's fine.

364
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:47,695
Could you... could you
slide over there, tiger?

365
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:49,276
Anything you say,
buddy.

366
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:44,623
Hey, Harper, step
lightly on over here.

367
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,462
Sure glad you could see
fit to come visit us.

368
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:55,717
I wouldn't have
missed this for the world.

369
00:27:55,925 --> 00:27:57,594
Jay Hue Kilbourne
here.

370
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:01,181
Always a pleasure
to welcome newcomers

371
00:28:01,348 --> 00:28:02,974
to our domain.

372
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:07,437
Uh,
they're in training.

373
00:28:08,688 --> 00:28:09,856
That one's ready.

374
00:28:10,565 --> 00:28:12,567
I raised that little
fella from a pup.

375
00:28:12,776 --> 00:28:13,943
Matter of fact,

376
00:28:14,152 --> 00:28:15,820
he favors
a nephew of mine.

377
00:28:17,113 --> 00:28:18,281
Boy's features
aren't regular.

378
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:19,824
Sort of pinched

379
00:28:19,991 --> 00:28:22,369
with strange
little ears.

380
00:28:23,328 --> 00:28:24,871
Damn near broke
my sister's heart.

381
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,332
Oh. I can imagine.

382
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,917
You know anything
about pit bulls,

383
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:30,125
Mr. Harper?

384
00:28:30,293 --> 00:28:31,670
We got regular
straight-up

385
00:28:31,878 --> 00:28:33,963
teeth matches
on weekends.

386
00:28:34,172 --> 00:28:35,757
Lot of big money
wagered.

387
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:37,884
And illegal as hell.

388
00:28:38,051 --> 00:28:39,469
How do you
tell the winner?

389
00:28:39,928 --> 00:28:43,014
Like anything else.
Only one sure way.

390
00:28:43,556 --> 00:28:45,350
One of them's
left alive.

391
00:28:48,687 --> 00:28:50,647
Hee! I have fun,
Mr. Harper.

392
00:28:50,855 --> 00:28:52,649
Hell of a good time.

393
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:54,984
You see, I'm not
like most folks

394
00:28:55,193 --> 00:28:57,028
who get their kicks
head-on.

395
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:00,615
I sort of slide in
sideways, like.

396
00:29:00,824 --> 00:29:03,952
As a matter of fact,
in high school,

397
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:07,455
they used to call me
the crab.

398
00:29:07,664 --> 00:29:08,664
Oh.

399
00:29:09,249 --> 00:29:10,875
Now you take
the oil business...

400
00:29:11,084 --> 00:29:12,084
My business.

401
00:29:12,293 --> 00:29:13,420
It's never
any fun

402
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:16,089
to drill
straight down.

403
00:29:16,297 --> 00:29:19,092
I'm a slant driller
by instinct.

404
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,219
Are you
slant drilling me?

405
00:29:22,512 --> 00:29:24,013
Very perceptive.

406
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:26,766
You see those tidelands,
Mr. Harper?

407
00:29:27,016 --> 00:29:28,017
Yeah.

408
00:29:28,226 --> 00:29:29,227
No. I mean right...

409
00:29:29,436 --> 00:29:31,020
No, I saw them.

410
00:29:31,771 --> 00:29:33,148
Well,
they're oil rich,

411
00:29:33,732 --> 00:29:35,567
and there's
just no end to them.

412
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:38,570
Now a good portion
of them I own,

413
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,239
but the biggest piece
is right there,

414
00:29:41,906 --> 00:29:43,426
and I don't have a thing
to do with it,

415
00:29:44,075 --> 00:29:45,285
but I aim to.

416
00:29:45,994 --> 00:29:47,579
I sure enough
aim to.

417
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,580
Guess who's...

418
00:29:49,664 --> 00:29:51,040
Olivia Devereaux.

419
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:56,087
Outstanding.

420
00:29:56,546 --> 00:29:58,590
$100 million
in black gold

421
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,175
underneath that earth,

422
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:02,051
and you know what
she wants to do

423
00:30:02,302 --> 00:30:03,887
with that land,
Mr. Harper?

424
00:30:04,095 --> 00:30:05,180
She wants to turn it

425
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,474
into a goddamn
sanctuary for birds.

426
00:30:07,682 --> 00:30:09,851
I think
that's kind of sweet.

427
00:30:10,393 --> 00:30:12,479
Well, now look, I'm all
for saving wildlife

428
00:30:12,687 --> 00:30:14,063
like the next fella,

429
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:16,816
but we got to think
about America's future.

430
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:18,610
Energy sources
just aren't that easy

431
00:30:18,818 --> 00:30:19,986
to come by.

432
00:30:20,195 --> 00:30:22,405
Uh-huh. Did you come
to that conclusion

433
00:30:22,614 --> 00:30:24,783
out of patriotism
or just greed?

434
00:30:27,285 --> 00:30:29,287
Little of both,
Mr. Harper,

435
00:30:29,454 --> 00:30:31,247
like
most men of wealth.

436
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:36,294
Now, I guess you know
why I sent for you.

437
00:30:36,503 --> 00:30:37,503
I have...

438
00:30:37,587 --> 00:30:38,797
Not here, not here.

439
00:30:39,005 --> 00:30:40,423
A little privacy, huh?

440
00:30:48,306 --> 00:30:49,390
Just preliminaries.

441
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:50,975
Preliminaries,
that's all.

442
00:30:54,604 --> 00:30:56,022
Now tell me,

443
00:30:56,231 --> 00:30:58,274
why do you think
I sent for you?

444
00:30:59,108 --> 00:31:00,360
Can't say
that I know, captain,

445
00:31:00,568 --> 00:31:01,194
but there
are some people

446
00:31:01,402 --> 00:31:02,562
who think that
I work for you.

447
00:31:02,695 --> 00:31:04,072
They've been
reading my mind,

448
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,490
'cause
that's just exactly

449
00:31:05,698 --> 00:31:07,116
what I wanted
you to do...

450
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:09,159
Work for me.

451
00:31:10,078 --> 00:31:12,121
I don't think
I could get used to it.

452
00:31:12,747 --> 00:31:14,874
I think you'd learn
to enjoy it.

453
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:18,962
I look at it this way,
Mr. Harper...

454
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,338
Three people
are involved...

455
00:31:21,005 --> 00:31:22,715
Or should I say
could be involved...

456
00:31:22,924 --> 00:31:24,676
With the title
to that land.

457
00:31:24,884 --> 00:31:26,094
Uh,
let's start with James.

458
00:31:26,302 --> 00:31:27,554
It turns out,

459
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,514
through some
incredible good fortune,

460
00:31:29,681 --> 00:31:32,725
I've got a whole lot
of embarrassing material

461
00:31:32,934 --> 00:31:34,519
of the visual kind

462
00:31:35,562 --> 00:31:37,021
that, uh, could be used

463
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:39,357
regarding
James' unorthodox

464
00:31:39,566 --> 00:31:40,859
sexual persuasions.

465
00:31:41,693 --> 00:31:43,820
Now
Iris is another story.

466
00:31:44,612 --> 00:31:46,781
You're a nice-looking
young man.

467
00:31:47,031 --> 00:31:48,157
Oh, yeah.

468
00:31:48,366 --> 00:31:50,618
And I
hear tell that Iris...

469
00:31:50,827 --> 00:31:53,121
Well, bless her heart,

470
00:31:53,913 --> 00:31:55,999
she likes
to play around a little.

471
00:31:56,624 --> 00:31:59,294
You could be
most helpful with her.

472
00:32:00,503 --> 00:32:03,381
Mean a great deal to me,
and to you, too.

473
00:32:04,883 --> 00:32:07,969
Well, that still leaves
Olivia, though, doesn't it?

474
00:32:08,136 --> 00:32:10,179
That leaves Olivia.

475
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:12,223
But you got that
figured out.

476
00:32:16,352 --> 00:32:17,520
Can I go now?

477
00:32:18,187 --> 00:32:19,187
Why, certainly.

478
00:32:19,355 --> 00:32:23,026
Uh, Candy, Mr. Harper's
anxious to leave now.

479
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:25,111
Well, what about
my proposal?

480
00:32:25,361 --> 00:32:26,905
I'll give it
a lot of consideration.

481
00:32:27,155 --> 00:32:28,275
And I'm sure
we'll be hearing

482
00:32:28,406 --> 00:32:29,406
from you soon, huh?

483
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:30,782
Jay hue.

484
00:32:32,327 --> 00:32:33,369
Outstanding.

485
00:32:58,937 --> 00:32:59,937
Hey!

486
00:33:00,104 --> 00:33:01,189
Drinks for everybody.

487
00:33:06,235 --> 00:33:07,737
Hey, where's the action
around here?

488
00:33:08,321 --> 00:33:09,572
Just kind of early,
mister.

489
00:33:09,781 --> 00:33:11,199
The place doesn't
start jumping

490
00:33:11,407 --> 00:33:12,407
until about 9:00,
man.

491
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:13,576
Here.

492
00:33:14,035 --> 00:33:15,578
Would you like to try
a coon ass beer?

493
00:33:16,746 --> 00:33:18,998
A coon ass? Sure.

494
00:33:22,377 --> 00:33:24,295
You know a guy
by the name of Pat Reavis?

495
00:33:24,504 --> 00:33:25,922
Hmm. I might.

496
00:33:27,256 --> 00:33:28,925
I understand he spends
a lot of time here.

497
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:31,445
Is he a friend of yours
or something, mister?

498
00:33:31,469 --> 00:33:33,346
Eh, something.
I'm supposed to meet him.

499
00:33:33,596 --> 00:33:34,698
Yeah. Well, them guys
are working

500
00:33:34,722 --> 00:33:35,807
them rigs all day, man.

501
00:33:36,015 --> 00:33:37,215
They usually
come in here late.

502
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:38,601
Things really
picks up, man.

503
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:40,853
Yeah. That's
what Pat told me.

504
00:33:41,771 --> 00:33:43,165
Yeah, man. Reavis
really got himself

505
00:33:43,189 --> 00:33:44,941
a hot little chick
down there.

506
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:47,819
He told me that, too.

507
00:33:47,986 --> 00:33:50,071
Uh, what's-her-face.
The hot one?

508
00:33:50,321 --> 00:33:51,155
Gretchen, man.

509
00:33:51,322 --> 00:33:52,365
Greshen.

510
00:33:52,573 --> 00:33:54,325
Not just the face.
The body.

511
00:33:54,534 --> 00:33:55,868
Greshen.
Oh, you mean Gretchen.

512
00:33:56,077 --> 00:33:57,203
That's what I said,
yeah.

513
00:33:57,412 --> 00:33:58,788
Mm. Mm-hmm.

514
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:04,669
How you like that
coon ass beer, man?

515
00:34:06,087 --> 00:34:07,087
Works.

516
00:34:20,768 --> 00:34:22,103
I spotted your car.

517
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,940
You spotted my car?

518
00:34:26,858 --> 00:34:28,860
Will it wash off?
That's a rental.

519
00:34:30,737 --> 00:34:31,737
Clown.

520
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:34,449
You're going to come
with me, clown.

521
00:34:35,742 --> 00:34:36,451
Yeah?

522
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:38,244
Who did I molest
this time?

523
00:34:40,246 --> 00:34:41,956
You'd better watch
your mouth, mister.

524
00:34:42,874 --> 00:34:44,375
You're going to push me
too far.

525
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:47,370
You know
what I think, Franks?

526
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,380
I think this is just
another roust.

527
00:34:49,589 --> 00:34:51,215
I got no time
to dance with you.

528
00:34:51,716 --> 00:34:53,760
You hold it right there,
old horse.

529
00:34:56,596 --> 00:34:59,223
Y'all better stop
right about there, Harper.

530
00:35:01,517 --> 00:35:02,560
Harper!

531
00:35:14,238 --> 00:35:15,238
I got him, chief.

532
00:35:15,406 --> 00:35:16,550
You know,
she's a nice dancer,

533
00:35:16,574 --> 00:35:18,034
but her likes to lead.

534
00:35:18,242 --> 00:35:19,242
Listen, clown,

535
00:35:19,827 --> 00:35:20,578
one of these days

536
00:35:20,787 --> 00:35:22,121
you're going to be
sunnyside up.

537
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:25,041
Lieutenant, get
a fingerprint kit down here.

538
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:27,959
Yes, sir.

539
00:35:52,902 --> 00:35:54,403
<i>Louie, lève le drap.</i>

540
00:36:02,995 --> 00:36:04,038
How'd it go down?

541
00:36:04,372 --> 00:36:05,081
Pretty ugly.

542
00:36:05,289 --> 00:36:06,391
Crushed her head
with that rake

543
00:36:06,415 --> 00:36:07,583
and pushed her in.

544
00:36:08,626 --> 00:36:09,418
Any suspects?

545
00:36:09,627 --> 00:36:10,979
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

546
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:12,588
Now, you've been around
here all day...

547
00:36:12,797 --> 00:36:13,589
Oh, come on now.

548
00:36:13,798 --> 00:36:14,798
I'm not on that list.

549
00:36:14,841 --> 00:36:17,009
No. Unless you give me
a reason.

550
00:36:19,137 --> 00:36:21,472
You ever hear of Reavis?
Pat Reavis?

551
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:24,015
What,
the chauffeur?

552
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,100
Uh-huh.

553
00:36:25,601 --> 00:36:27,241
Yeah. Well, I was trying
to track him down

554
00:36:27,311 --> 00:36:29,105
when old Bullethead
found me in a bar.

555
00:36:29,564 --> 00:36:32,275
We think he's running.
But tell me,

556
00:36:32,483 --> 00:36:34,277
what's your interest
in Reavis?

557
00:36:34,485 --> 00:36:35,736
Let me talk
to my client first.

558
00:36:35,945 --> 00:36:37,155
No, no, no. Now,
wait a minute.

559
00:36:37,363 --> 00:36:38,841
Now, what do you think
you are, a lawyer?

560
00:36:38,865 --> 00:36:40,283
This is a homicide,

561
00:36:40,741 --> 00:36:42,368
and I want to know
about Reavis.

562
00:36:42,535 --> 00:36:43,661
What's against him?

563
00:36:44,453 --> 00:36:45,872
Well, for one thing,
he was fired.

564
00:36:46,372 --> 00:36:48,166
For another, we found
his wallet on the lawn

565
00:36:48,374 --> 00:36:50,001
between here
and the house.

566
00:36:50,209 --> 00:36:52,170
And for another,
he disappeared.

567
00:36:52,378 --> 00:36:53,938
That's all kind
of convenient, isn't it?

568
00:36:54,005 --> 00:36:55,047
No.

569
00:36:56,382 --> 00:36:58,176
I would like to talk
to my client first.

570
00:36:58,384 --> 00:37:00,136
Sure, sure.
That's your right.

571
00:37:01,262 --> 00:37:03,389
She's by the little
house at the pool.

572
00:37:06,684 --> 00:37:07,684
Harper,

573
00:37:07,727 --> 00:37:08,853
stick close by.

574
00:37:09,103 --> 00:37:10,855
Don't be taking
any trips.

575
00:37:12,231 --> 00:37:13,232
O.K.

576
00:37:28,289 --> 00:37:30,416
I never can get
these things off.

577
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:32,084
Maybe you shouldn't try.

578
00:37:36,714 --> 00:37:38,174
I'm sorry about Olivia.

579
00:37:38,716 --> 00:37:39,842
Thank you.

580
00:37:41,928 --> 00:37:42,928
Ha ha.

581
00:37:43,054 --> 00:37:44,180
That's a joke.

582
00:37:45,431 --> 00:37:47,558
God, I loathed that woman.

583
00:37:48,184 --> 00:37:49,852
Broussard's starting
to ask questions.

584
00:37:50,061 --> 00:37:51,701
He wants to know what
I know about Reavis.

585
00:37:51,812 --> 00:37:53,123
Do you want me to tell
him about the letter,

586
00:37:53,147 --> 00:37:54,587
or do you want me
to dance around him

587
00:37:54,732 --> 00:37:55,816
and do some
fancy footwork?

588
00:37:56,025 --> 00:37:57,025
What do you want
me to do?

589
00:37:57,526 --> 00:37:58,694
What difference
does it make?

590
00:37:58,903 --> 00:38:00,529
Let's talk about
something else.

591
00:38:01,113 --> 00:38:02,823
What do you want me
to do?

592
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:07,870
I want you to make it
like it was six years ago.

593
00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:17,672
Your sense of timing
always amazes me.

594
00:38:30,768 --> 00:38:32,561
Oh! No kidding!

595
00:38:32,812 --> 00:38:34,272
You're a name freak.

596
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,649
Don't spread
that around!

597
00:38:38,985 --> 00:38:40,903
You got any gs
around here?

598
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:42,989
Any gs?

599
00:38:43,155 --> 00:38:44,155
Um...

600
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:48,159
Jennifer!

601
00:38:48,703 --> 00:38:49,703
That's a "J."

602
00:38:50,121 --> 00:38:51,455
You sure?

603
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:53,791
Well...

604
00:38:56,085 --> 00:38:57,085
Gretchen!

605
00:38:57,253 --> 00:38:58,337
That's a "G."

606
00:38:58,546 --> 00:38:59,588
G-r-e-t...

607
00:38:59,797 --> 00:39:00,881
Wait! Which one's she?

608
00:39:01,882 --> 00:39:02,925
Pink flower.

609
00:39:04,051 --> 00:39:05,469
I better warn you,
though.

610
00:39:05,678 --> 00:39:06,678
She's
a working girl.

611
00:39:06,804 --> 00:39:07,930
That's
going to cost you.

612
00:39:08,264 --> 00:39:09,307
I hope so.

613
00:39:09,473 --> 00:39:11,350
I just love her!
Just love her!

614
00:39:17,898 --> 00:39:19,442
You've got to be
kidding me.

615
00:39:20,484 --> 00:39:22,903
I mean, what's so sexy
about names?

616
00:39:23,112 --> 00:39:24,572
Well, probably nothing,

617
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,532
but it just happened
that way.

618
00:39:26,741 --> 00:39:28,868
It was Gertrude, Gloria,
Ginger, and Gidget,

619
00:39:29,118 --> 00:39:30,745
and they was all 10s.

620
00:39:30,953 --> 00:39:32,538
And another one coming.

621
00:39:32,788 --> 00:39:34,373
Oh, I hope so.

622
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:37,376
Come on, dude,
what's your story?

623
00:39:40,212 --> 00:39:42,465
Pat said that you was
the best cu...

624
00:39:44,717 --> 00:39:46,344
One of, uh...

625
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,263
He said you was
one of the...

626
00:39:49,472 --> 00:39:51,557
I guess he just wanted me
to say hello.

627
00:39:52,099 --> 00:39:54,018
Pat Reavis?

628
00:39:54,226 --> 00:39:55,519
Yeah. One and the same.

629
00:39:55,728 --> 00:39:57,021
He's one hell of a fella.

630
00:39:57,229 --> 00:39:58,647
No, he's not.

631
00:39:58,898 --> 00:40:00,441
He just kind of
turns me on.

632
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:03,736
Pat never told me
about you.

633
00:40:04,612 --> 00:40:06,739
Yeah. Well, see, I'm new
on the rig down there.

634
00:40:06,947 --> 00:40:09,784
He was going to come up here
and meet me

635
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:11,744
and was going
to introduce us.

636
00:40:14,121 --> 00:40:15,289
Look, I owe him...

637
00:40:15,831 --> 00:40:16,957
Some money.

638
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:20,669
Well, then,
he'll find you.

639
00:40:24,632 --> 00:40:26,217
Why don't you take
your shoes off

640
00:40:26,425 --> 00:40:27,676
and relax?

641
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:31,305
I think it's
kind of early to...

642
00:40:32,515 --> 00:40:34,034
Are you afraid
to take your clothes off

643
00:40:34,058 --> 00:40:35,226
in front of women?

644
00:40:35,768 --> 00:40:37,603
I don't know
that I'm afraid...

645
00:40:37,853 --> 00:40:39,522
Don't worry about it.

646
00:40:40,356 --> 00:40:42,525
You'd be surprised
at some of the thi...

647
00:40:44,735 --> 00:40:47,071
Well, what's your thing?
What are you into?

648
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:49,740
I'd just like to try
a little conversation first.

649
00:40:49,949 --> 00:40:50,991
Oh, sure.

650
00:40:51,242 --> 00:40:53,160
You want to call me
dirty names?

651
00:40:53,702 --> 00:40:54,954
I didn't say that.

652
00:40:55,579 --> 00:40:57,373
You want me to call you
dirty names?

653
00:40:57,581 --> 00:40:59,750
No. I didn't
say that, either.

654
00:40:59,959 --> 00:41:02,753
I don't know how people
can dirty talk cold Turkey.

655
00:41:03,504 --> 00:41:07,133
I mean, I... I got to get
a kind of a run on it

656
00:41:07,341 --> 00:41:08,676
or get some...

657
00:41:10,094 --> 00:41:11,094
Foreplay here.

658
00:41:11,137 --> 00:41:12,471
You know what I mean?

659
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:18,310
I'd better get a refill.

660
00:41:29,989 --> 00:41:31,240
Hey, this, uh...

661
00:41:32,116 --> 00:41:32,783
Good old Pat.

662
00:41:32,992 --> 00:41:34,201
You seen him around
lately?

663
00:41:35,035 --> 00:41:36,996
Not since last weekend.

664
00:41:38,289 --> 00:41:39,790
He's probably
down at his place

665
00:41:39,999 --> 00:41:41,500
in New Orleans.

666
00:41:45,463 --> 00:41:47,548
Oh, boy. He just must be
raking it in.

667
00:41:47,756 --> 00:41:50,342
I didn't know he had a place
down in New Orleans.

668
00:41:51,177 --> 00:41:53,512
Well, it's not
a palace exactly,

669
00:41:53,721 --> 00:41:55,431
but it's
in the quarter,

670
00:41:55,681 --> 00:41:57,683
not too far
from Jackson square.

671
00:42:05,024 --> 00:42:08,152
How about if I gave you
a dirty word...

672
00:42:08,777 --> 00:42:10,654
And then you have to
make up another one,

673
00:42:10,863 --> 00:42:12,781
starting with
the last letter

674
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,909
of the one
I just gave you?

675
00:42:19,163 --> 00:42:20,163
Wait a minute.

676
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:21,683
You're going to give me
a dirty word

677
00:42:21,707 --> 00:42:23,125
and then the last...

678
00:42:25,294 --> 00:42:27,087
Hey, honey,
that's awful complicated.

679
00:42:27,338 --> 00:42:28,398
I don't think we're going
to get much action

680
00:42:28,422 --> 00:42:29,423
out of that.

681
00:42:31,091 --> 00:42:33,761
Hey, so you're
kind of rushing it.

682
00:42:36,305 --> 00:42:38,682
Jackson square? Well,
that's a ritzy place.

683
00:42:39,433 --> 00:42:41,560
Uh, exactly, uh...

684
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:44,688
Exactly where does Pat live
around there?

685
00:42:45,105 --> 00:42:46,649
I was only there once.

686
00:42:47,066 --> 00:42:49,485
It's near
that cute little hotel

687
00:42:49,693 --> 00:42:51,529
with
the cornstalk fence.

688
00:42:52,279 --> 00:42:54,782
Around in back.

689
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:57,576
A room right off
the main drag.

690
00:42:57,785 --> 00:42:59,078
Cool it, honey.

691
00:43:00,746 --> 00:43:01,789
Thanks.

692
00:44:39,261 --> 00:44:40,261
Uh.

693
00:44:40,304 --> 00:44:41,304
Did you ring,
Mr. Reavis?

694
00:44:41,472 --> 00:44:42,472
Uh-huh.

695
00:44:42,556 --> 00:44:44,642
I've had your laundry
here for a week.

696
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:45,893
Will you pick it up?

697
00:44:46,101 --> 00:44:48,312
Mm-hmm. Messages?

698
00:44:48,604 --> 00:44:50,022
Your sister Elaine
called,

699
00:44:50,898 --> 00:44:52,858
but that was
three days ago.

700
00:44:53,067 --> 00:44:54,068
O.K.

701
00:44:55,194 --> 00:44:56,194
Thanks.

702
00:45:59,049 --> 00:46:00,926
Elaine called.

703
00:46:22,823 --> 00:46:25,117
<i>Qu'est-ce que tu fais,
mon cher?</i>

704
00:46:26,076 --> 00:46:27,076
What is?

705
00:46:27,411 --> 00:46:28,871
What you doing here?

706
00:46:31,123 --> 00:46:31,915
What...

707
00:46:32,082 --> 00:46:33,333
Am I doing here?

708
00:46:33,834 --> 00:46:36,587
Well, I was walking
down the street...

709
00:46:36,795 --> 00:46:37,796
<i>Qui est ce mec?</i>

710
00:46:39,173 --> 00:46:40,799
It beats the shit
out of me.

711
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:47,222
O.K., O.K. Let's take it
from the top again.

712
00:46:49,516 --> 00:46:51,518
Now, what you
doing here?

713
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:55,314
O.K., I'll give it
to you straight.

714
00:46:55,522 --> 00:46:56,899
I'm a burglar
just like you.

715
00:46:57,316 --> 00:46:58,460
I'll save you
a lot of trouble.

716
00:46:58,484 --> 00:46:59,777
Ain't
nothing here.

717
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:02,338
<i>S'il a trouvé quelque chose,
il doit I'avoir sur lui.</i>

718
00:47:02,362 --> 00:47:03,113
Maybe he's
telling the truth.

719
00:47:03,322 --> 00:47:04,322
Let's take him with us.

720
00:47:04,573 --> 00:47:06,492
Tie his hands
and search him.

721
00:47:18,378 --> 00:47:19,713
Oh, my.

722
00:47:21,465 --> 00:47:23,634
It's not nice to look up
ladies' dresses.

723
00:47:24,176 --> 00:47:26,595
Well, everybody's
got to look someplace.

724
00:47:29,181 --> 00:47:29,890
No Reavis,

725
00:47:30,098 --> 00:47:31,517
no account book.
Just this guy.

726
00:47:35,729 --> 00:47:36,939
Lew Harper,
Los Angeles.

727
00:47:38,398 --> 00:47:39,983
You're a long way
from home, Lew.

728
00:47:41,109 --> 00:47:43,028
I'm working my way
down to Miami.

729
00:47:43,654 --> 00:47:46,824
Uh-huh. Just what were you
looking for in that place?

730
00:47:47,407 --> 00:47:48,617
An honest buck.

731
00:47:49,284 --> 00:47:50,284
Did you find anything?

732
00:47:51,995 --> 00:47:52,663
Like what?

733
00:47:52,913 --> 00:47:54,373
It was all junk in there.

734
00:47:54,581 --> 00:47:56,083
Wouldn't even take it
to a fence.

735
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,586
Like maybe
an account book?

736
00:47:59,795 --> 00:48:02,422
I don't follow account
books very much.

737
00:48:03,048 --> 00:48:04,328
You know,
it's mostly appliances,

738
00:48:04,466 --> 00:48:06,301
watches, jewelry,
things like that.

739
00:48:11,056 --> 00:48:12,224
How's that grab you?

740
00:48:13,016 --> 00:48:14,685
Oh, well,
I mean, that's...

741
00:48:16,353 --> 00:48:17,353
That's a beaut.

742
00:48:17,521 --> 00:48:19,523
Yeah, it's pretty nice,
wouldn't you say?

743
00:48:19,731 --> 00:48:20,983
What do you mean, nice?

744
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,694
That would set me up
for life in palm beach.

745
00:48:25,362 --> 00:48:26,154
Well, now, Lew, honey,

746
00:48:26,363 --> 00:48:28,490
this wouldn't set you up
for a week in Hoboken.

747
00:48:29,241 --> 00:48:30,241
It's a fake.

748
00:48:30,325 --> 00:48:31,869
Oh, no.

749
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:34,413
Yeah?

750
00:48:35,706 --> 00:48:37,165
<i>Allons faire un tour.</i>

751
00:48:44,673 --> 00:48:45,673
This has all been

752
00:48:45,799 --> 00:48:48,135
an unfortunate
mistake, Lew.

753
00:48:52,598 --> 00:48:54,641
Can you just forget
it ever happened?

754
00:48:55,475 --> 00:48:57,102
Hey, what's to forget?

755
00:48:58,103 --> 00:48:59,103
You wouldn't
throw me over

756
00:48:59,187 --> 00:49:00,456
for an old little
account book, now,

757
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,648
would you, sugar?

758
00:49:01,899 --> 00:49:03,191
Uh-uh.

759
00:49:04,943 --> 00:49:07,571
Oh, honey, that's no fair.
My hands are tied.

760
00:49:07,988 --> 00:49:10,282
That's just to protect
you from self-abuse.

761
00:49:11,074 --> 00:49:12,242
You don't abuse
yourself,

762
00:49:12,451 --> 00:49:13,869
now, do you, sugar?

763
00:49:15,037 --> 00:49:16,872
It would be
such a waste.

764
00:49:49,071 --> 00:49:51,323
<i>Elaine Reavis, telephone.</i>

765
00:49:51,657 --> 00:49:54,326
<i>Elaine Reavis, telephone.</i>

766
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:53,612
No, honey, you see
that won't work either.

767
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:55,405
I've got to stay away
from my apartment

768
00:51:55,614 --> 00:51:56,615
for a few days.

769
00:51:57,491 --> 00:51:59,618
Listen, I always loved
your place.

770
00:51:59,826 --> 00:52:00,994
What's wrong
with it now?

771
00:52:01,870 --> 00:52:03,580
Yeah, that's the spirit.

772
00:52:05,207 --> 00:52:06,517
O.K. I'll just
pack my toothbrush,

773
00:52:06,541 --> 00:52:08,376
and I'll see you
after supper. Bye.

774
00:52:12,005 --> 00:52:13,507
Hey, you got
any food here?

775
00:52:13,924 --> 00:52:14,966
I'm starving.

776
00:52:16,176 --> 00:52:18,053
Just give me
a minute to change.

777
00:52:18,261 --> 00:52:19,638
I'll fix you something.

778
00:52:21,556 --> 00:52:22,641
Let the cat in.

779
00:52:23,475 --> 00:52:24,475
Yeah.

780
00:52:31,399 --> 00:52:32,776
Aha.

781
00:52:33,693 --> 00:52:35,153
A little bonus here.

782
00:52:36,321 --> 00:52:37,447
Here we are.

783
00:52:39,991 --> 00:52:41,535
Hands up against
the fireplace.

784
00:52:47,332 --> 00:52:48,583
Who do you work for?

785
00:52:48,792 --> 00:52:49,835
I'm an exterminator.

786
00:52:50,293 --> 00:52:51,293
Shit.

787
00:52:58,260 --> 00:52:59,052
You don't have
to count it.

788
00:52:59,261 --> 00:53:00,887
There's
$10,000 there.

789
00:53:02,139 --> 00:53:03,765
Nice going, Elaine.

790
00:53:04,099 --> 00:53:05,642
Who else did you
bring back here?

791
00:53:06,518 --> 00:53:07,518
I didn't know.

792
00:53:07,686 --> 00:53:08,854
I didn't know!

793
00:53:09,062 --> 00:53:10,062
Shut up.

794
00:53:13,066 --> 00:53:14,734
What did you do
this time, Pat?

795
00:53:14,985 --> 00:53:15,610
Nothing.

796
00:53:15,819 --> 00:53:17,696
Killed an old lady
for hire, it looks like.

797
00:53:17,904 --> 00:53:19,739
That's bullshit.
I didn't, I swear.

798
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:20,990
Hello, operator.

799
00:53:21,116 --> 00:53:22,701
Get me the Rivage
police department.

800
00:53:22,951 --> 00:53:24,828
Yeah. Name is Harper.

801
00:53:25,036 --> 00:53:27,497
It's an emergency,
and I'll wait.

802
00:53:28,123 --> 00:53:29,163
I'm taking you in, Reavis.

803
00:53:29,624 --> 00:53:30,917
I didn't do it, man.
You hear me?

804
00:53:31,126 --> 00:53:32,586
I didn't kill
that old lady.

805
00:53:32,794 --> 00:53:36,882
Uh-huh. How's a punk
like you get $10,000?

806
00:53:38,049 --> 00:53:39,593
Five-card draw,
big time.

807
00:53:39,801 --> 00:53:43,471
You never told me
about that, Pat.

808
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:44,680
Hello.
Give me Broussard.

809
00:53:44,764 --> 00:53:46,141
He isn't?
Who is this, Franks?

810
00:53:46,349 --> 00:53:48,349
Well, listen, you think
you can handle a message...

811
00:53:48,435 --> 00:53:50,562
You punk! I'm always
holding you together!

812
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:52,022
Oh, yeah.
That's right.

813
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:53,356
With that big job
of yours

814
00:53:53,565 --> 00:53:54,667
and all that dough
you rake in,

815
00:53:54,691 --> 00:53:55,734
you're going
to take care

816
00:53:55,901 --> 00:53:56,901
of all of us,
aren't ya?

817
00:53:56,985 --> 00:53:58,111
No, I'll bring him in.

818
00:53:58,361 --> 00:54:00,155
It'll take
half the time.

819
00:54:00,363 --> 00:54:01,643
You're a two-bit hustler.
A stud.

820
00:54:01,823 --> 00:54:03,063
Last time.
I've had it with you.

821
00:54:03,283 --> 00:54:05,493
Girls, girls,
girls.

822
00:54:07,662 --> 00:54:08,663
Hey, listen.

823
00:54:08,872 --> 00:54:11,291
You may be some kind
of hotshot policeman,

824
00:54:11,791 --> 00:54:12,791
but I'm here
to tell you

825
00:54:12,876 --> 00:54:14,044
that you're
out of your depth.

826
00:54:14,211 --> 00:54:15,420
You're into something

827
00:54:15,587 --> 00:54:17,464
that's way over
your head.

828
00:54:19,132 --> 00:54:20,132
You drive.

829
00:54:27,557 --> 00:54:28,850
10 grand.

830
00:54:29,517 --> 00:54:30,727
That's nickel and dime.

831
00:54:30,936 --> 00:54:33,355
What were you doing at
the Devereauxs' yesterday?

832
00:54:34,314 --> 00:54:35,398
I wasn't there.

833
00:54:35,857 --> 00:54:37,025
I was fired.

834
00:54:37,609 --> 00:54:39,986
Reavis, I saw your car.

835
00:54:43,657 --> 00:54:45,492
I didn't kill
that old lady.

836
00:54:46,576 --> 00:54:47,369
I didn't
know about it

837
00:54:47,577 --> 00:54:48,870
till I got back
to town.

838
00:54:49,079 --> 00:54:51,206
Oh, yeah? Why didn't
you go see the police?

839
00:54:52,624 --> 00:54:53,708
You kidding?

840
00:54:53,917 --> 00:54:55,418
Me against
the Devereauxs?

841
00:54:56,002 --> 00:54:58,004
One guess
who gets the shaft.

842
00:54:58,838 --> 00:55:00,066
You still didn't
answer my question.

843
00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:00,840
Let me rephrase it.

844
00:55:01,049 --> 00:55:03,093
What were you doing
at the Devereauxs' yesterday?

845
00:55:06,388 --> 00:55:07,748
Schuyler and me
were getting it on.

846
00:55:07,931 --> 00:55:09,349
So, what's the big deal?

847
00:55:09,891 --> 00:55:11,434
The kid's got
a crush on me.

848
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:13,812
That's why I was fired.

849
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:16,856
Oh, yeah? I thought it was
because of the letter

850
00:55:17,065 --> 00:55:18,858
that you wrote
to Iris' husband.

851
00:55:19,025 --> 00:55:20,026
What letter?

852
00:55:20,235 --> 00:55:21,653
I don't write letters.

853
00:55:21,861 --> 00:55:24,739
All I know is that they
stuck it to me good.

854
00:55:25,031 --> 00:55:26,658
I don't chase women,
buddy.

855
00:55:26,866 --> 00:55:28,034
They chase me.

856
00:55:30,412 --> 00:55:32,747
Yeah, well, you've certainly
got them running after you.

857
00:55:32,956 --> 00:55:35,792
How do you do that? I mean,
you got a special wrinkle?

858
00:55:36,334 --> 00:55:37,645
Is it that your kinky pad
of yours

859
00:55:37,669 --> 00:55:39,021
with all those mirrors
and everything?

860
00:55:39,045 --> 00:55:40,463
Creep! Shut
your stupid mouth!

861
00:55:40,672 --> 00:55:42,757
Oh, wait a minute.
I'm filled with admiration.

862
00:55:43,091 --> 00:55:45,218
Some guys just look good
in the locker room.

863
00:55:54,686 --> 00:55:56,354
Let's cut the crap,
O.K.?

864
00:55:58,898 --> 00:56:00,483
What do you want
from me?

865
00:56:01,276 --> 00:56:02,276
Money?

866
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:04,680
There's plenty more
of that coming,

867
00:56:05,697 --> 00:56:07,782
and you could be in
for a big piece.

868
00:56:09,492 --> 00:56:10,492
Half?

869
00:56:10,618 --> 00:56:11,618
Yeah...

870
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:13,580
If you get off my back.

871
00:56:19,085 --> 00:56:20,604
Yeah, but then we'd
have to be friendly,

872
00:56:20,628 --> 00:56:22,964
go to the same
restaurants and... nah.

873
00:56:24,299 --> 00:56:25,925
What's the difference
to you?

874
00:56:27,344 --> 00:56:29,637
C... come on, man,
move over.

875
00:56:30,096 --> 00:56:31,096
Get on the shoulder.

876
00:56:31,264 --> 00:56:31,890
What shoulder?

877
00:56:32,098 --> 00:56:33,578
There's nothing but
a swamp out there.

878
00:57:11,179 --> 00:57:12,514
Didn't I tell you,
big time?

879
00:57:12,722 --> 00:57:13,890
It's not
your territory.

880
00:57:18,603 --> 00:57:19,813
We want Reavis.

881
00:57:20,605 --> 00:57:21,605
He's my prisoner,

882
00:57:21,773 --> 00:57:23,013
and I'm bringing him in
with me.

883
00:58:15,535 --> 00:58:16,661
You never got
a message?

884
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:18,455
Mm-mmm. Nothing
on the blotter

885
00:58:18,663 --> 00:58:20,081
except a common drunk

886
00:58:20,248 --> 00:58:22,375
and a Grand Theft Auto,
that's all.

887
00:58:24,043 --> 00:58:25,803
Maybe you called the wrong
police department.

888
00:58:26,629 --> 00:58:27,755
Well, if I did,

889
00:58:28,506 --> 00:58:30,842
Franks was on the other end
of that telephone.

890
00:58:39,225 --> 00:58:41,311
Where is old Bullethead?

891
00:58:43,313 --> 00:58:44,731
Well, I was told
sick leave.

892
00:58:44,939 --> 00:58:47,025
Something about
a hunting accident.

893
00:58:47,233 --> 00:58:48,776
Be out the rest of
the week, at least.

894
00:58:50,028 --> 00:58:52,447
Oh, at least.

895
00:58:53,281 --> 00:58:55,992
I'll bet he's got a sling
on his right arm, too.

896
00:58:56,201 --> 00:58:57,911
What are you
trying to say?

897
00:58:58,119 --> 00:58:59,996
You making some kind
of charge?

898
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:05,126
Who do you think would
want to kill Reavis?

899
00:59:05,335 --> 00:59:06,419
Oh, a lot of people.

900
00:59:06,628 --> 00:59:07,921
Lot of people.

901
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:10,715
Olivia Devereaux
was highly respected

902
00:59:10,924 --> 00:59:11,716
in this community,

903
00:59:11,883 --> 00:59:12,634
no matter what
her family thought

904
00:59:12,842 --> 00:59:14,135
about her.

905
00:59:14,302 --> 00:59:17,472
She was the leader of
a certain lifestyle,

906
00:59:17,639 --> 00:59:19,098
a certain... Order

907
00:59:20,058 --> 00:59:21,160
which a lot of folk
around here

908
00:59:21,184 --> 00:59:22,184
took comfort in.

909
00:59:22,268 --> 00:59:24,062
So all those
blue-haired ladies

910
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:25,897
from the bridge club
just went down

911
00:59:26,064 --> 00:59:27,899
and bumped off
big bad Pat.

912
00:59:28,107 --> 00:59:29,867
That's your privilege
to think what you like.

913
00:59:33,238 --> 00:59:34,238
Uh, look, Harper,

914
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:35,949
the Devereauxs have
been through a lot.

915
00:59:36,157 --> 00:59:37,157
I'd just as soon

916
00:59:37,325 --> 00:59:38,701
put a lid on
the whole thing.

917
00:59:40,411 --> 00:59:42,205
I don't want Iris
to get hurt...

918
00:59:42,789 --> 00:59:43,873
Or Schuyler.

919
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:47,794
I'm just, uh, worried
about my batting average.

920
00:59:47,961 --> 00:59:49,295
What about it?

921
00:59:49,504 --> 00:59:51,548
Well, first my client's
mother-in-law gets it.

922
00:59:51,756 --> 00:59:54,175
Then... her daughter's
boyfriend.

923
00:59:54,509 --> 00:59:55,176
Uh-uh.

924
00:59:55,385 --> 00:59:56,177
Uh-uh.

925
00:59:56,386 --> 00:59:57,386
You got it wrong.

926
00:59:58,179 --> 01:00:00,265
Schuyler had nothing
to do with Pat Reavis.

927
01:00:01,099 --> 01:00:03,101
Oh, come on, Broussard,

928
01:00:03,309 --> 01:00:05,019
you baby-sit that girl.

929
01:00:05,353 --> 01:00:06,646
You telling me
you don't know?

930
01:00:07,647 --> 01:00:09,274
You know,
for a fast 150 a day,

931
01:00:09,482 --> 01:00:10,984
you sure do a lot
of speculating.

932
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:13,403
The way you've been chasing
after that teenybopper,

933
01:00:13,611 --> 01:00:15,113
I think you want
to ball her yourself.

934
01:00:16,823 --> 01:00:17,574
One more of those,

935
01:00:17,782 --> 01:00:19,422
and I'll knock you right
through the wall.

936
01:00:19,993 --> 01:00:20,993
You hear me?

937
01:00:21,744 --> 01:00:22,912
Now, as far as
I'm concerned,

938
01:00:23,079 --> 01:00:24,747
this case is closed.

939
01:00:41,264 --> 01:00:43,808
Who would want to do
a thing like that?

940
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:48,479
I got no answers.

941
01:00:48,938 --> 01:00:50,440
I believed
you last time,

942
01:00:50,648 --> 01:00:52,567
and look what
it got Pat!

943
01:00:53,234 --> 01:00:55,111
You're a cop,
aren't you?

944
01:00:56,571 --> 01:00:58,656
Well, second cousin.
I'm a private.

945
01:00:59,282 --> 01:01:00,282
Bastard!

946
01:01:00,742 --> 01:01:02,160
I let you soft-soap me

947
01:01:02,368 --> 01:01:03,745
into telling you
where Pat lived,

948
01:01:03,953 --> 01:01:05,204
and now he's dead!

949
01:01:05,413 --> 01:01:07,457
You're a hell of a guy,
you know that?

950
01:01:07,665 --> 01:01:09,000
You betcha.

951
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:10,890
All I was trying to do
was keep him alive.

952
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,379
So justice could
triumph, no doubt.

953
01:01:13,588 --> 01:01:16,007
Hey. I got no idea
what justice is.

954
01:01:16,174 --> 01:01:17,967
I am interested
in truth, though.

955
01:01:18,176 --> 01:01:19,761
Oh, that's a laugh.

956
01:01:19,969 --> 01:01:22,180
All right, not the big
philosophical stuff,

957
01:01:23,139 --> 01:01:25,141
the everyday things like
who, why, when, where.

958
01:01:26,017 --> 01:01:26,809
I'll tell you what.

959
01:01:27,018 --> 01:01:29,187
I'm interested in why
Pat Reavis was killed,

960
01:01:29,979 --> 01:01:32,190
and I'm interested
in why I got roughed up

961
01:01:32,398 --> 01:01:33,834
for something that was
supposed to be hidden

962
01:01:33,858 --> 01:01:35,526
in his place
in the quarter.

963
01:01:36,653 --> 01:01:37,945
An account book?

964
01:01:41,199 --> 01:01:43,242
You want me to try
to find out who killed him?

965
01:01:44,827 --> 01:01:46,788
What good's that
going to do <i>him?</i>

966
01:01:47,038 --> 01:01:48,373
No good at all...

967
01:01:48,581 --> 01:01:50,375
Except I think
he'd understand.

968
01:01:51,668 --> 01:01:52,835
What makes you so sure

969
01:01:53,044 --> 01:01:54,796
that I have
the account book?

970
01:01:55,505 --> 01:01:57,757
Because it wasn't where
it was supposed to be,

971
01:01:59,133 --> 01:02:01,219
and I think you're
the only person he trusts.

972
01:02:05,890 --> 01:02:07,250
I don't know why
I should help you.

973
01:02:07,308 --> 01:02:08,476
I don't know
why I should...

974
01:02:09,143 --> 01:02:10,561
Even listen to you.

975
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:11,770
Hey, don't.

976
01:02:12,939 --> 01:02:14,065
Got a beer?

977
01:02:14,315 --> 01:02:15,400
Help yourself.

978
01:02:26,119 --> 01:02:27,119
Thanks.

979
01:02:59,736 --> 01:03:01,112
You got any idea
what you got here?

980
01:03:03,197 --> 01:03:04,824
He told me just to
keep it for him,

981
01:03:05,032 --> 01:03:06,451
not to look in it.

982
01:03:06,659 --> 01:03:08,411
Well, let me tell you
something.

983
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:11,164
Old Jay Hue Kilbourne

984
01:03:11,372 --> 01:03:12,957
kicked back to
a lot of lawmakers

985
01:03:13,166 --> 01:03:15,084
to get those
oil leases of his.

986
01:03:16,377 --> 01:03:17,377
Whoo.

987
01:03:20,256 --> 01:03:22,216
Oh, boy, could this
make justice triumph.

988
01:03:23,885 --> 01:03:25,261
Keep it for me,
will you?

989
01:03:42,653 --> 01:03:43,696
Help me out, O.K.?

990
01:03:50,286 --> 01:03:52,205
How'd you like
to help me

991
01:03:52,413 --> 01:03:54,081
put on some
suntan lotion?

992
01:03:55,082 --> 01:03:56,082
Wouldn't help, honey.

993
01:03:56,209 --> 01:03:56,959
You're going to be
burned out

994
01:03:57,210 --> 01:03:58,544
by the time you're 30.

995
01:04:00,171 --> 01:04:01,672
I'm looking
for your mama.

996
01:04:02,173 --> 01:04:03,633
She's down at the bayou.

997
01:04:14,977 --> 01:04:18,147
I thought private eyes
only read mystery stories.

998
01:04:20,650 --> 01:04:22,276
Who told you I was
a private eye?

999
01:04:24,111 --> 01:04:25,863
Mr. Harper.

1000
01:04:34,413 --> 01:04:35,414
Did you tell her?

1001
01:04:36,541 --> 01:04:37,541
I got pretty tired

1002
01:04:37,667 --> 01:04:39,836
of seeing you hanging
around, Harper,

1003
01:04:40,169 --> 01:04:41,712
so Iris explained to me

1004
01:04:41,963 --> 01:04:44,423
about that stupid note
the chauffeur wrote,

1005
01:04:44,590 --> 01:04:46,926
like it was something
I give a damn about.

1006
01:04:47,134 --> 01:04:49,387
I told her to get you
the hell out.

1007
01:04:49,762 --> 01:04:52,056
I'm sure she'll want
to say goodbye.

1008
01:05:10,241 --> 01:05:11,993
Well...
What do you know?

1009
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:15,705
I think I've
just been fired.

1010
01:05:16,914 --> 01:05:18,165
Oh, really? By whom?

1011
01:05:19,375 --> 01:05:20,877
The master
of the house.

1012
01:05:21,544 --> 01:05:22,753
Well, that's nice.

1013
01:05:22,962 --> 01:05:23,713
That's the first
positive action

1014
01:05:23,963 --> 01:05:25,798
he's taken in years.

1015
01:05:27,758 --> 01:05:28,758
He can't fire me.

1016
01:05:28,926 --> 01:05:30,303
I've ruined a perfectly
good suit.

1017
01:05:31,387 --> 01:05:34,140
And I've run up
800 bucks in expenses.

1018
01:05:34,724 --> 01:05:36,684
You <i>are</i> incredible,
Lew.

1019
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:38,352
You have a problem.

1020
01:05:38,561 --> 01:05:40,521
You have no talent
for surrender.

1021
01:05:41,022 --> 01:05:42,022
Yeah.

1022
01:05:43,274 --> 01:05:46,193
I guess I got this wild
selfish streak in me.

1023
01:05:46,777 --> 01:05:47,777
I'm going to be sued

1024
01:05:47,862 --> 01:05:49,280
by that rent-a-car
company, too,

1025
01:05:49,488 --> 01:05:50,488
you know.

1026
01:05:50,698 --> 01:05:51,782
Go away.

1027
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:54,994
Why don't you learn
to give up things gracefully?

1028
01:05:55,202 --> 01:05:56,202
I can't.

1029
01:05:57,538 --> 01:05:59,415
I know who wrote
that letter.

1030
01:06:00,207 --> 01:06:01,207
Schuyler.

1031
01:06:01,751 --> 01:06:03,294
What makes you think that?

1032
01:06:04,503 --> 01:06:06,047
It's right out
of her schoolbook.

1033
01:06:07,381 --> 01:06:09,592
Reavis was a
functioning illiterate,

1034
01:06:09,759 --> 01:06:11,361
for Christ's sake. She
had him sounding like

1035
01:06:11,385 --> 01:06:12,970
a 17th century
Lyric poet.

1036
01:06:13,387 --> 01:06:15,640
You're lying. Why do you
think she'd do that?

1037
01:06:22,563 --> 01:06:23,773
I don't think
you know a lot

1038
01:06:24,023 --> 01:06:25,524
about your daughter,
Iris.

1039
01:06:25,733 --> 01:06:27,401
What are you trying
to do to me?

1040
01:06:27,735 --> 01:06:29,820
What is <i>she</i> trying
to do to you?

1041
01:06:35,117 --> 01:06:36,953
Pat Reavis was killed.

1042
01:06:38,287 --> 01:06:40,581
The question is,
who killed him and why?

1043
01:06:41,457 --> 01:06:43,584
Things are getting
pretty ugly around here.

1044
01:06:43,793 --> 01:06:45,127
I don't much
care for it,

1045
01:06:45,336 --> 01:06:46,128
but fired or not,

1046
01:06:46,337 --> 01:06:48,017
I'm going to stick it
through to the end...

1047
01:06:50,424 --> 01:06:52,551
And people may not like
everything I find.

1048
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:53,760
You understand?

1049
01:06:57,974 --> 01:06:59,475
Doesn't really matter.

1050
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:47,189
Oh!

1051
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:48,482
Aah! Aah!

1052
01:07:59,785 --> 01:08:01,579
How was your
vacation, Franks?

1053
01:08:01,746 --> 01:08:02,746
Christ!

1054
01:08:03,372 --> 01:08:04,081
I understand you had

1055
01:08:04,290 --> 01:08:05,916
an unfortunate
hunting accident.

1056
01:08:06,709 --> 01:08:08,669
You know that you assaulted
a police officer?

1057
01:08:09,086 --> 01:08:10,379
Not important.

1058
01:08:10,838 --> 01:08:13,215
I don't think Broussard
likes you anymore.

1059
01:08:14,008 --> 01:08:15,342
Where's your
mardi gras mask?

1060
01:08:16,302 --> 01:08:17,822
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1061
01:08:18,679 --> 01:08:20,347
I ain't got no time
to mess around.

1062
01:08:20,556 --> 01:08:21,932
Let's start
from the top.

1063
01:08:22,183 --> 01:08:23,983
How much did Kilbourne
pay you to kill Reavis?

1064
01:08:25,352 --> 01:08:27,188
You're not going to
pull that trigger.

1065
01:08:27,396 --> 01:08:28,396
You big-city boys

1066
01:08:28,481 --> 01:08:30,399
are up to your ass
in rules.

1067
01:08:34,653 --> 01:08:35,653
Oh, boy.

1068
01:08:53,089 --> 01:08:55,674
All right, I got
two live ones in there.

1069
01:08:55,883 --> 01:08:56,675
Bull.

1070
01:08:56,842 --> 01:08:57,842
Bull what?

1071
01:08:57,885 --> 01:08:58,886
You got nothing
in there.

1072
01:09:01,305 --> 01:09:02,431
One more to go.

1073
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:04,433
Now, let's start
from the top.

1074
01:09:04,683 --> 01:09:06,477
How much did
Kilbourne pay you?

1075
01:09:07,269 --> 01:09:08,395
I don't have to
say nothing.

1076
01:09:09,105 --> 01:09:10,745
I know my rights and
the Miranda decision.

1077
01:09:11,732 --> 01:09:12,732
Two.

1078
01:09:12,817 --> 01:09:13,817
God damn.

1079
01:09:14,568 --> 01:09:15,820
God damn it,
are you crazy?

1080
01:09:16,028 --> 01:09:17,696
Right. Want
to play again?

1081
01:09:22,284 --> 01:09:24,453
Kilbourne always pays me
a little something

1082
01:09:24,703 --> 01:09:26,497
whenever he needs
a favor done.

1083
01:09:26,956 --> 01:09:29,083
How much did he pay you
to kill Reavis?

1084
01:09:30,835 --> 01:09:32,275
No, I'll have my ass
in a sling if...

1085
01:09:33,087 --> 01:09:33,796
Three.

1086
01:09:34,004 --> 01:09:36,215
You son of a bitch.
$5,000!

1087
01:09:36,423 --> 01:09:37,633
God damn!

1088
01:09:38,008 --> 01:09:39,218
Why did he
want him dead?

1089
01:09:39,426 --> 01:09:40,426
I don't know.

1090
01:09:41,428 --> 01:09:42,096
Four.

1091
01:09:42,304 --> 01:09:43,347
I tell you. I don't know.

1092
01:09:43,556 --> 01:09:44,991
I swear to the almighty,
I don't know. Honest.

1093
01:09:45,015 --> 01:09:46,015
Come on, you Turkey.

1094
01:09:46,183 --> 01:09:47,685
Why did he want him
dead?

1095
01:09:47,893 --> 01:09:50,312
'Cause he paid Reavis to
kill old lady Devereaux?

1096
01:09:50,521 --> 01:09:52,064
I don't know.
I don't know!

1097
01:09:52,314 --> 01:09:53,482
Five!

1098
01:09:53,691 --> 01:09:55,901
Oh, sweet, screaming Jesus,
I don't know!

1099
01:09:56,110 --> 01:09:58,487
I swear to the almighty,
I don't know!

1100
01:10:06,036 --> 01:10:07,705
I don't much care
for it...

1101
01:10:08,789 --> 01:10:10,374
But I guess I got
to believe you.

1102
01:10:13,752 --> 01:10:14,879
Christ.

1103
01:10:24,346 --> 01:10:26,432
Personally, I think
you held up rather well.

1104
01:11:22,279 --> 01:11:23,279
It's O.K.

1105
01:11:23,322 --> 01:11:24,490
Good boy.

1106
01:11:25,532 --> 01:11:27,493
All I got to do
is say the magic word,

1107
01:11:27,701 --> 01:11:28,701
and you're dog food.

1108
01:11:29,328 --> 01:11:31,121
Let him aboard, Candy!

1109
01:11:31,789 --> 01:11:32,873
Hello, Mr. Harper.

1110
01:11:33,290 --> 01:11:35,000
I been hoping
to see you.

1111
01:11:35,918 --> 01:11:38,003
Some tub you got here,
Jay hue.

1112
01:11:38,254 --> 01:11:40,047
Just one
of my fun fleet.

1113
01:11:40,756 --> 01:11:43,259
Now, please don't think
I'm inhospitable.

1114
01:11:43,467 --> 01:11:45,261
Nothing but vandals
everywhere.

1115
01:11:45,928 --> 01:11:49,223
Those puppy dogs sure
cut my insurance rates.

1116
01:11:49,431 --> 01:11:51,016
You come on inside.

1117
01:12:10,661 --> 01:12:12,705
I don't believe
you've met my wife.

1118
01:12:15,291 --> 01:12:17,418
Can't say that I have.

1119
01:12:18,502 --> 01:12:20,754
Mavis, darling,
this is Mr. Harper.

1120
01:12:21,755 --> 01:12:23,716
How do you do,
Mr. Harper?

1121
01:12:24,341 --> 01:12:26,802
Some days I do better
than other days.

1122
01:12:28,262 --> 01:12:30,597
Uh, Mavis, want to go
for a walk?

1123
01:12:32,433 --> 01:12:33,642
How long a walk,
darling?

1124
01:12:34,184 --> 01:12:36,812
Oh, I don't know,
may-may. Average.

1125
01:12:37,021 --> 01:12:38,480
Just average.

1126
01:12:44,361 --> 01:12:45,112
It's a pleasure
meeting you,

1127
01:12:45,321 --> 01:12:46,321
Mr. Harper.

1128
01:12:46,613 --> 01:12:47,613
Sweet child.

1129
01:12:48,115 --> 01:12:49,575
Uh, sit down,
Mr. Harper.

1130
01:12:50,993 --> 01:12:52,536
One of my other
passions.

1131
01:12:52,703 --> 01:12:53,829
Cooking.

1132
01:12:54,038 --> 01:12:57,207
This is shrimp étouffé.

1133
01:12:57,458 --> 01:12:59,251
Local favorite,
but my version.

1134
01:13:00,044 --> 01:13:01,795
Uh, could I get you
a drink?

1135
01:13:02,713 --> 01:13:04,340
Yeah. A little
of that Glenlivet

1136
01:13:04,548 --> 01:13:05,841
might hit the spot.

1137
01:13:06,425 --> 01:13:07,425
Outstanding.

1138
01:13:07,843 --> 01:13:09,845
A man who knows
his liquor.

1139
01:13:15,225 --> 01:13:16,518
Free pour.

1140
01:13:21,774 --> 01:13:23,525
I've got this
bad old stomach,

1141
01:13:23,734 --> 01:13:25,861
and I can't touch
a thing but cereals.

1142
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:28,864
What do you do
with all the food?

1143
01:13:29,073 --> 01:13:30,866
Dump it overboard,
of course.

1144
01:13:31,116 --> 01:13:33,494
Fish seem to
enjoy it immensely.

1145
01:13:35,662 --> 01:13:36,955
Want a taste?

1146
01:13:37,331 --> 01:13:38,957
Uh, not this trip, no.

1147
01:13:39,458 --> 01:13:40,584
Just as well.

1148
01:13:41,835 --> 01:13:44,463
It needs to...
Set a bit.

1149
01:13:47,049 --> 01:13:48,842
Can the fish
really tell?

1150
01:13:49,051 --> 01:13:51,220
Ha ha. I expect
they can.

1151
01:13:52,054 --> 01:13:53,054
Now...

1152
01:13:54,014 --> 01:13:55,849
What can I do for you,
Mr. Harper?

1153
01:14:03,399 --> 01:14:05,109
The Devereaux oil lease.

1154
01:14:05,442 --> 01:14:07,528
I'd like a pretty
big chunk of that.

1155
01:14:09,363 --> 01:14:10,572
I'm sorry, Mr. Harper.

1156
01:14:11,156 --> 01:14:12,699
Along with my bad
old stomach,

1157
01:14:12,866 --> 01:14:15,828
I'm... I'm having trouble
with my hearing lately.

1158
01:14:16,662 --> 01:14:17,830
Uh-huh.

1159
01:14:18,455 --> 01:14:20,207
Well, Jay hue,
we can be friends.

1160
01:14:21,667 --> 01:14:23,269
Reavis showed me
the 10 grand you paid him

1161
01:14:23,293 --> 01:14:24,837
to kill
old lady Devereaux.

1162
01:14:26,046 --> 01:14:28,465
I'm afraid Reavis
is dead, Mr. Harper.

1163
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:31,969
Yeah, that he is,
that he is.

1164
01:14:33,804 --> 01:14:35,180
But Franks ain't.

1165
01:14:38,559 --> 01:14:40,060
And he told me
about the 5 grand

1166
01:14:40,269 --> 01:14:42,354
you paid <i>him</i> to kill Reavis.

1167
01:14:42,813 --> 01:14:44,040
I mean, I think
that's kind of neat.

1168
01:14:44,064 --> 01:14:45,064
There's not many people

1169
01:14:45,149 --> 01:14:46,483
who can afford
to hire a killer

1170
01:14:46,692 --> 01:14:48,944
and then hire a cop
to kill <i>him.</i>

1171
01:14:51,155 --> 01:14:52,739
I hate to be
a spoilsport,

1172
01:14:52,948 --> 01:14:54,032
Mr. Harper...

1173
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:57,327
You doing all that
good figuring...

1174
01:14:58,078 --> 01:14:59,955
But I did not hire
Reavis

1175
01:15:00,164 --> 01:15:01,874
to kill
Olivia Devereaux.

1176
01:15:02,749 --> 01:15:04,960
He was in your employ.

1177
01:15:05,544 --> 01:15:08,547
You bought him when he was
the Devereaux chauffeur.

1178
01:15:08,755 --> 01:15:10,382
He was my spy.

1179
01:15:10,799 --> 01:15:12,217
An industrial spy.

1180
01:15:12,801 --> 01:15:15,304
Happens all the time.
Just good business.

1181
01:15:16,138 --> 01:15:17,264
When Reavis hit me

1182
01:15:17,473 --> 01:15:21,059
with that first
installment of $10,000

1183
01:15:21,226 --> 01:15:23,061
to keep quiet
about a murder

1184
01:15:23,270 --> 01:15:25,898
I had absolutely
nothing to do with...

1185
01:15:27,107 --> 01:15:29,401
Tried to implicate me
in it...

1186
01:15:29,610 --> 01:15:30,610
Well...

1187
01:15:31,987 --> 01:15:33,822
Let's just say I...

1188
01:15:33,989 --> 01:15:37,034
Was not unhappy
when he...

1189
01:15:37,201 --> 01:15:40,496
Met with that most
unfortunate accident.

1190
01:15:40,704 --> 01:15:41,788
Mm-hmm.

1191
01:15:41,997 --> 01:15:44,708
I ran a check on you,
Mr. Harper.

1192
01:15:46,001 --> 01:15:47,836
You are not stupid.

1193
01:15:48,462 --> 01:15:49,838
I have my moments.

1194
01:15:50,923 --> 01:15:52,716
You want to live,
don't you...

1195
01:15:53,509 --> 01:15:55,511
To a ripe old age?

1196
01:15:56,553 --> 01:15:57,179
I'd hate to think

1197
01:15:57,387 --> 01:15:59,267
that I was making those
social security payments

1198
01:15:59,306 --> 01:16:00,306
for nothing.

1199
01:16:04,228 --> 01:16:07,272
'Cause I hold
all the aces.

1200
01:16:13,278 --> 01:16:15,656
I'm not so sure
about that, Jay hue.

1201
01:16:17,950 --> 01:16:19,535
You're missing
an account book.

1202
01:16:25,624 --> 01:16:27,417
Now, how the hell
did you get that?

1203
01:16:27,668 --> 01:16:28,961
Just doing my job.

1204
01:16:30,629 --> 01:16:33,632
You got guts, Harper,
coming in here like this.

1205
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:36,176
Aw, not really,
Jay hue.

1206
01:16:37,261 --> 01:16:39,137
So long as I stay
alive and healthy,

1207
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:41,640
it stays tucked away
and out of sight.

1208
01:16:42,307 --> 01:16:44,184
$150,000, Harper.

1209
01:16:45,727 --> 01:16:48,146
Uh, 250,000.
That's my last offer.

1210
01:16:48,730 --> 01:16:49,730
No deal.

1211
01:16:50,232 --> 01:16:51,232
Harper, you listening?

1212
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:52,943
Nice talking to you,
Jay hue.

1213
01:16:55,988 --> 01:16:56,988
Harper?

1214
01:16:58,073 --> 01:17:00,617
Hey, that's a quarter
of a million dollars!

1215
01:17:00,826 --> 01:17:02,578
You crazy, boy?

1216
01:17:05,664 --> 01:17:06,664
Harper?

1217
01:17:14,256 --> 01:17:15,536
We got to stop meeting
like this.

1218
01:17:15,591 --> 01:17:16,800
People
will start talking.

1219
01:17:17,593 --> 01:17:19,553
He had Pat Reavis killed
for that account book.

1220
01:17:19,761 --> 01:17:21,179
No kidding.

1221
01:17:21,763 --> 01:17:22,963
It won't take him
much figuring

1222
01:17:23,056 --> 01:17:24,600
before he works out
the rest of it.

1223
01:17:24,808 --> 01:17:26,226
Aha! The rest being

1224
01:17:26,435 --> 01:17:29,187
that you gave Reavis
the account book to begin with.

1225
01:17:29,438 --> 01:17:30,606
And then what?

1226
01:17:31,231 --> 01:17:33,567
A little long-distance
blackmail from Acapulco?

1227
01:17:33,775 --> 01:17:35,611
Harper, I have to get
away from Jay hue.

1228
01:17:36,403 --> 01:17:37,403
He's crazy.

1229
01:17:37,571 --> 01:17:38,571
I mean...

1230
01:17:40,741 --> 01:17:41,908
I mean,
he's really crazy.

1231
01:17:42,993 --> 01:17:44,369
I hadn't noticed.

1232
01:17:45,037 --> 01:17:47,205
Thanks for the tip.
I'll be especially careful.

1233
01:17:47,414 --> 01:17:48,957
Harper, this isn't
fun and games!

1234
01:17:49,666 --> 01:17:51,627
He'll do anything
to get that book.

1235
01:17:52,878 --> 01:17:54,171
You got to
take me with you.

1236
01:17:54,379 --> 01:17:57,758
No way. I gave up
self-abuse...

1237
01:17:57,966 --> 01:17:59,301
In high school.

1238
01:17:59,926 --> 01:18:01,553
O.K., I deserve that.

1239
01:18:02,137 --> 01:18:03,263
I owe you one.

1240
01:18:04,890 --> 01:18:06,224
You pick
the time and place,

1241
01:18:06,433 --> 01:18:07,726
but he'll hurt me.

1242
01:18:08,435 --> 01:18:10,854
I mean, he'll really
hurt me this time.

1243
01:18:13,732 --> 01:18:14,732
Please.

1244
01:18:19,655 --> 01:18:20,822
Wait in my car.

1245
01:18:21,281 --> 01:18:22,366
I got to make
a phone call.

1246
01:18:29,956 --> 01:18:31,541
Iris, you awake?

1247
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:33,168
Who is this?

1248
01:18:33,377 --> 01:18:34,419
It's California.

1249
01:18:34,878 --> 01:18:36,171
I'm just checking in.

1250
01:18:37,214 --> 01:18:38,340
What do you want?

1251
01:18:38,882 --> 01:18:40,008
I just wanted to say,

1252
01:18:40,258 --> 01:18:42,052
I don't think Reavis
killed the old lady.

1253
01:18:44,471 --> 01:18:46,014
Well, you're wrong.

1254
01:18:47,683 --> 01:18:50,102
Now, I don't care
if that man is dead.

1255
01:18:50,310 --> 01:18:51,103
You find a way,

1256
01:18:51,311 --> 01:18:52,688
and you prove
that he did it.

1257
01:18:54,022 --> 01:18:55,315
Are you on the bottle?

1258
01:18:55,899 --> 01:18:58,151
I'm telling you.
Reavis isn't the guy.

1259
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:00,195
Why don't you
just drop it, Lew?

1260
01:19:02,614 --> 01:19:04,199
Just get off the case...

1261
01:19:05,367 --> 01:19:06,702
And leave me alone.

1262
01:19:08,161 --> 01:19:10,122
Hey, what the hell
is happening out there?

1263
01:19:12,165 --> 01:19:14,501
Get out of here
and get out of my life.

1264
01:19:14,710 --> 01:19:16,336
I don't want you
rummaging around

1265
01:19:16,545 --> 01:19:18,088
in my closets anymore.

1266
01:19:22,092 --> 01:19:25,637
It's a juggling act just
to make my life work.

1267
01:19:27,097 --> 01:19:28,724
Try to get some sleep,
will you?

1268
01:19:29,850 --> 01:19:30,850
Lew...

1269
01:19:31,059 --> 01:19:32,102
Don't hang up.

1270
01:19:34,896 --> 01:19:36,314
Listen to me.

1271
01:19:41,278 --> 01:19:42,487
I... I can't...

1272
01:19:43,029 --> 01:19:45,490
Handle
the responsibility.

1273
01:19:46,408 --> 01:19:47,408
Iris?

1274
01:19:48,326 --> 01:19:49,886
Now, listen, you
turn on the television.

1275
01:19:49,953 --> 01:19:51,163
I'll be right over.

1276
01:19:52,998 --> 01:19:54,291
No, um...

1277
01:19:56,877 --> 01:19:57,877
Don't do that.

1278
01:20:01,089 --> 01:20:02,674
I'll mail you
your money.

1279
01:20:05,719 --> 01:20:07,137
Just go away.

1280
01:20:13,351 --> 01:20:14,351
Iris?

1281
01:20:53,850 --> 01:20:55,185
Aah!

1282
01:20:55,435 --> 01:20:56,603
Aah!

1283
01:20:57,187 --> 01:20:58,396
Stop!

1284
01:20:59,815 --> 01:21:00,565
No!

1285
01:21:00,774 --> 01:21:02,192
Oh!

1286
01:21:02,359 --> 01:21:05,237
No. No!

1287
01:21:05,487 --> 01:21:07,364
Stop it!

1288
01:21:07,531 --> 01:21:08,531
Stop!

1289
01:21:08,573 --> 01:21:09,658
Stop it!

1290
01:21:14,037 --> 01:21:15,705
Stop it!

1291
01:21:22,045 --> 01:21:23,296
Outstanding.

1292
01:21:24,297 --> 01:21:26,716
You know, the patients used
to pay a fortune for this,

1293
01:21:26,925 --> 01:21:27,925
Mr. Harper.

1294
01:21:29,636 --> 01:21:33,431
Sometimes, it would even
restore their memory.

1295
01:21:35,225 --> 01:21:36,810
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1296
01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:38,140
You're loony
as a fruitcake,

1297
01:21:38,186 --> 01:21:39,354
you know that?

1298
01:21:40,689 --> 01:21:42,524
I'll make believe
I didn't hear that.

1299
01:21:42,983 --> 01:21:43,983
Doctor.

1300
01:22:09,718 --> 01:22:11,136
Stop!

1301
01:22:20,687 --> 01:22:22,564
You'll kill him,
you bas...

1302
01:22:28,236 --> 01:22:29,613
You can scream.

1303
01:22:30,405 --> 01:22:31,907
Scream all you like,
darling.

1304
01:22:32,449 --> 01:22:34,701
This place has been out
of business for years.

1305
01:22:35,327 --> 01:22:36,912
It's soundproof anyways.

1306
01:22:37,579 --> 01:22:39,497
You remember what
I told you, Mr. Harper,

1307
01:22:39,706 --> 01:22:41,791
about my crablike ways?

1308
01:22:42,876 --> 01:22:45,754
Now, you can save yourself
a whole lot of...

1309
01:22:46,338 --> 01:22:47,505
Unnecessary...

1310
01:22:48,548 --> 01:22:49,758
Excitement...

1311
01:22:50,383 --> 01:22:52,677
If you just tell me
where that little book is.

1312
01:22:58,058 --> 01:22:59,351
Andy...

1313
01:22:59,935 --> 01:23:02,479
This man is sorely
trying my Patience.

1314
01:23:02,938 --> 01:23:05,774
Maybe you need time to reflect
on it, Mr. Harper.

1315
01:23:05,982 --> 01:23:07,567
It's going to be a long,
hard night...

1316
01:23:08,443 --> 01:23:09,443
Cold...

1317
01:23:09,569 --> 01:23:10,569
wet...

1318
01:23:11,237 --> 01:23:12,237
nasty.

1319
01:23:12,447 --> 01:23:13,573
Mighty uncomfortable...

1320
01:23:13,823 --> 01:23:16,701
But we'll be back
bright and early tomorrow.

1321
01:23:17,702 --> 01:23:19,287
By then I think
you'll want to tell me

1322
01:23:19,496 --> 01:23:20,664
where that book is.

1323
01:23:20,830 --> 01:23:22,624
Now, don't you
go away now.

1324
01:23:22,791 --> 01:23:24,292
Y'all take care.

1325
01:23:46,982 --> 01:23:48,483
You O.K.?

1326
01:23:48,692 --> 01:23:49,734
Ah!

1327
01:23:50,527 --> 01:23:52,737
Son of a bitch
tried to kill me.

1328
01:23:55,865 --> 01:23:58,368
Well, he's coming back
in the morning for seconds.

1329
01:24:01,454 --> 01:24:02,831
Could you get me out
of this thing?

1330
01:24:04,791 --> 01:24:06,001
I can try.

1331
01:24:20,015 --> 01:24:22,392
Shit, I'm going to
break my nails.

1332
01:24:27,564 --> 01:24:28,749
Harper, why don't
you just give him

1333
01:24:28,773 --> 01:24:29,524
that stupid account book

1334
01:24:29,733 --> 01:24:31,093
so we can get the hell
out of here?

1335
01:24:31,234 --> 01:24:32,277
Honey,
there ain't no way

1336
01:24:32,485 --> 01:24:34,112
he's gonna let us
out of here.

1337
01:24:43,455 --> 01:24:44,164
Jay hue!

1338
01:24:44,372 --> 01:24:45,372
Jay hue!

1339
01:24:48,501 --> 01:24:49,502
Jay hue!

1340
01:24:53,798 --> 01:24:54,798
Jay hue?

1341
01:24:56,176 --> 01:24:57,260
No. Easy, easy.

1342
01:24:58,553 --> 01:24:59,553
Easy!

1343
01:25:00,889 --> 01:25:01,890
Oh, no.

1344
01:25:02,265 --> 01:25:03,265
No!

1345
01:25:03,683 --> 01:25:05,226
Oh, my god!

1346
01:25:05,935 --> 01:25:07,270
Aah!

1347
01:25:12,275 --> 01:25:12,984
I don't know why

1348
01:25:13,193 --> 01:25:15,070
I ever married
the crazy son of a bitch.

1349
01:25:15,361 --> 01:25:17,155
I was always afraid of him.

1350
01:25:17,322 --> 01:25:18,573
He's such a freak.

1351
01:25:19,032 --> 01:25:20,492
Him and his damn oil.

1352
01:25:21,076 --> 01:25:22,702
He never
gave me anything...

1353
01:25:23,286 --> 01:25:24,037
But his crab.

1354
01:25:24,245 --> 01:25:26,289
Look at this.
Look at this crab.

1355
01:25:27,707 --> 01:25:29,584
I don't have
one real thing.

1356
01:25:31,669 --> 01:25:32,921
Not one real diamond.

1357
01:25:33,129 --> 01:25:35,423
Look at this,
just rhinestones.

1358
01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:40,303
I got a whole drawerful
of rhinestones.

1359
01:26:02,325 --> 01:26:03,701
Take off your clothes.

1360
01:26:05,829 --> 01:26:07,789
I don't think
that's very funny.

1361
01:26:08,206 --> 01:26:10,458
I said, "take
off your clothes!"

1362
01:26:12,085 --> 01:26:14,462
You mind telling me
what you have in mind?

1363
01:26:16,756 --> 01:26:18,591
We're going to go right
out through there.

1364
01:26:22,512 --> 01:26:24,013
Come on. Get on it,
will you?

1365
01:27:31,497 --> 01:27:33,750
Harper, you sure you know
what you're doing, honey?

1366
01:27:47,722 --> 01:27:49,974
Well, all we can do now
is wait.

1367
01:27:52,727 --> 01:27:56,189
How did Jay hue wind up
with a place like this anyway?

1368
01:27:56,940 --> 01:27:59,192
His sweet mama sent him
here for the cure.

1369
01:28:00,151 --> 01:28:01,653
He didn't like
the way he was treated,

1370
01:28:02,237 --> 01:28:04,447
so he bought it up
and closed them down.

1371
01:28:05,949 --> 01:28:07,408
Is any of this
going to work?

1372
01:28:08,117 --> 01:28:08,910
I don't know.

1373
01:28:09,118 --> 01:28:11,079
If it doesn't,
we're in a lot of trouble.

1374
01:28:17,627 --> 01:28:18,827
It'll be
a little while longer.

1375
01:28:18,962 --> 01:28:20,171
Can you hold on?

1376
01:28:20,338 --> 01:28:21,172
Yes...

1377
01:28:21,339 --> 01:28:22,590
I think.

1378
01:28:45,113 --> 01:28:48,074
God, I can't get a grip
on the goddamn thing.

1379
01:28:48,825 --> 01:28:49,825
What do you mean?

1380
01:28:52,161 --> 01:28:53,161
Ah-huh.

1381
01:28:53,871 --> 01:28:55,581
Christ, we'll never
get it open now.

1382
01:28:55,873 --> 01:28:57,083
What do we do now?

1383
01:28:58,835 --> 01:29:00,086
Probably have to go down

1384
01:29:00,336 --> 01:29:02,255
and see if
I can get us a...

1385
01:29:04,007 --> 01:29:06,092
See if I can break out
of this skylight.

1386
01:29:27,405 --> 01:29:29,657
Uhh! Open.

1387
01:29:36,706 --> 01:29:38,750
Try... try harder.

1388
01:29:38,958 --> 01:29:39,751
Ehh...

1389
01:29:39,959 --> 01:29:41,419
Harder!

1390
01:29:42,962 --> 01:29:44,047
It won't break.

1391
01:29:45,673 --> 01:29:47,759
The water's
getting high!

1392
01:29:49,927 --> 01:29:51,179
I can't break it.

1393
01:29:51,346 --> 01:29:52,805
Give me that thing.

1394
01:29:53,639 --> 01:29:56,142
I'm going to see
if I can clear the drain.

1395
01:29:56,351 --> 01:29:57,810
I'll break it.

1396
01:29:58,019 --> 01:29:59,228
Yes, I'll break it.

1397
01:29:59,395 --> 01:30:00,897
God, I'll break it!

1398
01:30:25,713 --> 01:30:27,382
I'll break it!

1399
01:30:41,062 --> 01:30:41,813
No.

1400
01:30:42,063 --> 01:30:42,855
No, no!

1401
01:30:43,064 --> 01:30:44,273
I dropped it.

1402
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:45,440
No.

1403
01:30:45,817 --> 01:30:46,818
I dropped it.

1404
01:30:47,985 --> 01:30:49,237
I can't clear out
that drain.

1405
01:30:49,445 --> 01:30:50,863
There's too much suction.

1406
01:30:51,114 --> 01:30:53,533
Oh, let me get my breath.

1407
01:30:55,910 --> 01:30:57,388
I've got to try
to turn off some water.

1408
01:30:57,412 --> 01:30:58,162
Give me a hand.

1409
01:30:58,371 --> 01:31:01,249
No. No! If I go
down there, I'll... I'll...

1410
01:31:02,166 --> 01:31:04,168
Ah! I'll
drown down there!

1411
01:31:05,211 --> 01:31:06,504
I'll die down there!

1412
01:31:06,712 --> 01:31:07,797
I'll die! I'll die!

1413
01:31:08,005 --> 01:31:09,757
I'm going down myself.

1414
01:31:09,966 --> 01:31:11,175
I don't...

1415
01:31:11,384 --> 01:31:12,969
Want to die in here!

1416
01:32:02,310 --> 01:32:03,102
Couldn't do it.

1417
01:32:03,311 --> 01:32:04,103
No.

1418
01:32:04,312 --> 01:32:05,312
Couldn't do it.

1419
01:32:05,354 --> 01:32:06,354
No.

1420
01:32:09,025 --> 01:32:11,360
We're...
We're going to die.

1421
01:32:12,987 --> 01:32:14,780
Oh, mama...

1422
01:32:15,531 --> 01:32:17,575
What a dumb way to die.

1423
01:32:43,392 --> 01:32:44,392
Candy...

1424
01:32:45,978 --> 01:32:47,605
I forgot
my Gelusel tablets.

1425
01:32:47,813 --> 01:32:49,148
Did you leave them
in the car?

1426
01:32:49,857 --> 01:32:50,857
I could have.

1427
01:32:51,984 --> 01:32:52,693
I keep a spare

1428
01:32:52,902 --> 01:32:54,779
in the glove compartment
anyways.

1429
01:32:55,988 --> 01:32:57,323
You want me to go fetch it?

1430
01:33:01,494 --> 01:33:02,745
Well...

1431
01:33:03,996 --> 01:33:04,996
Ah, to hell with it.

1432
01:33:22,932 --> 01:33:24,100
Oh...

1433
01:33:24,350 --> 01:33:25,101
God!

1434
01:33:25,351 --> 01:33:26,351
Oh!

1435
01:33:52,044 --> 01:33:53,044
Are you O.K.?

1436
01:33:54,797 --> 01:33:56,437
Boy, that's one I don't
want to try again.

1437
01:33:56,841 --> 01:33:57,841
Let's get out of here

1438
01:33:57,967 --> 01:33:59,468
before Jay hue
gets back.

1439
01:34:26,495 --> 01:34:27,663
I can't
even get up.

1440
01:34:30,291 --> 01:34:31,334
I don't want you to.

1441
01:34:31,542 --> 01:34:33,102
I'm leaving you for
Broussard this time,

1442
01:34:33,294 --> 01:34:34,378
you understand?

1443
01:34:35,171 --> 01:34:36,672
It'll never stick,
Harper.

1444
01:34:42,094 --> 01:34:43,721
Watch him. I got
to find a phone.

1445
01:35:04,867 --> 01:35:05,867
May-may...

1446
01:35:09,413 --> 01:35:10,790
Want to kiss
and make up?

1447
01:35:23,386 --> 01:35:24,386
Ah!

1448
01:35:26,472 --> 01:35:28,099
What the hell
did you...

1449
01:35:36,190 --> 01:35:37,441
He's right.

1450
01:35:38,651 --> 01:35:40,152
He would have
gotten away with it.

1451
01:35:49,203 --> 01:35:51,539
Well, maybe you can
plead self-defense...

1452
01:35:52,707 --> 01:35:53,707
Cry a lot.

1453
01:35:54,458 --> 01:35:56,058
Throw yourself on
the mercy of the court.

1454
01:35:58,337 --> 01:35:59,463
He's dead.

1455
01:36:04,677 --> 01:36:05,677
Dead. He's...

1456
01:36:09,849 --> 01:36:11,142
Dead.

1457
01:36:57,062 --> 01:36:58,606
Oh, god.

1458
01:37:10,534 --> 01:37:11,827
When did it happen?

1459
01:37:13,829 --> 01:37:15,581
Uh, sometime last night.

1460
01:37:16,707 --> 01:37:18,387
What are you doing here
in the first place?

1461
01:37:18,459 --> 01:37:20,001
I fired you.
This is my house now.

1462
01:37:20,002 --> 01:37:21,295
And you get
the hell out.

1463
01:37:21,462 --> 01:37:23,379
Don't waste your energy
on form, pal.

1464
01:37:23,380 --> 01:37:24,380
You're in real trouble.

1465
01:37:24,507 --> 01:37:25,549
Trouble?

1466
01:37:26,801 --> 01:37:27,968
Everyone knows she was...

1467
01:37:28,636 --> 01:37:30,930
She was always fond
of seconal and liquor.

1468
01:37:31,180 --> 01:37:32,306
This was no accident.

1469
01:37:32,515 --> 01:37:33,974
That's a logical
assumption,

1470
01:37:34,183 --> 01:37:35,267
isn't it, Mr. Harper?

1471
01:37:37,770 --> 01:37:38,770
Beats me.

1472
01:37:39,021 --> 01:37:40,021
Who found her?

1473
01:37:40,105 --> 01:37:42,107
Schuyler found her
this morning and called me.

1474
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:44,443
Schuyler. Where is she?

1475
01:37:44,652 --> 01:37:46,195
They were quite
fond of one another,

1476
01:37:46,403 --> 01:37:47,403
you know. Touching...

1477
01:37:47,530 --> 01:37:48,948
Get him the hell
out of here!

1478
01:37:49,615 --> 01:37:50,783
Come on.

1479
01:37:50,991 --> 01:37:52,034
Come on!

1480
01:38:12,555 --> 01:38:14,098
What the hell
am I doing with these?

1481
01:38:20,521 --> 01:38:22,022
She tell you about us?

1482
01:38:23,774 --> 01:38:25,150
She didn't have to.

1483
01:38:26,277 --> 01:38:28,153
God, what a mistake I made.

1484
01:38:29,697 --> 01:38:33,117
I should have taken her away
from here a long time ago.

1485
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:37,663
I didn't know what to do.

1486
01:38:37,872 --> 01:38:39,039
I didn't know
where to go.

1487
01:38:39,248 --> 01:38:40,749
I was just a kid.

1488
01:38:41,750 --> 01:38:44,044
She was from
the finest family.

1489
01:38:47,965 --> 01:38:50,259
17 years ago, things
were a lot different.

1490
01:39:05,941 --> 01:39:07,109
I'm...

1491
01:39:08,193 --> 01:39:09,695
I'm so tired.

1492
01:39:12,489 --> 01:39:13,574
I'm so tired.

1493
01:39:18,454 --> 01:39:20,331
So goddamn tired.

1494
01:39:24,335 --> 01:39:26,295
Giving grandma's birds
a holiday, huh?

1495
01:39:26,503 --> 01:39:27,503
Why not?

1496
01:39:27,630 --> 01:39:29,173
They can go anywhere
they want now.

1497
01:39:29,882 --> 01:39:30,882
That's a bad move.

1498
01:39:31,008 --> 01:39:32,217
They won't
make it out there.

1499
01:39:32,676 --> 01:39:33,719
Tough.

1500
01:39:35,262 --> 01:39:37,056
The old lady was
a lot nicer to birds

1501
01:39:37,264 --> 01:39:39,099
than she was
to people, huh?

1502
01:39:39,725 --> 01:39:41,560
That's right, California.

1503
01:39:45,522 --> 01:39:47,566
Schuyler, I got all
the big stuff figured,

1504
01:39:49,109 --> 01:39:51,028
but it's tying up those
tiny, little loose ends

1505
01:39:51,236 --> 01:39:52,696
that's driving me
up the wall.

1506
01:39:53,072 --> 01:39:54,382
I mean, I know about
you and Reavis.

1507
01:39:54,406 --> 01:39:55,926
I saw you skulking
around in the bushes

1508
01:39:55,950 --> 01:39:57,201
out there
and I saw his car.

1509
01:39:57,409 --> 01:39:58,535
So what?

1510
01:39:59,787 --> 01:40:00,827
You're right.
Not relevant.

1511
01:40:00,913 --> 01:40:02,331
Well, what
I was getting at...

1512
01:40:02,831 --> 01:40:04,959
You know, as bad
a frame job as it was...

1513
01:40:05,167 --> 01:40:06,543
See? Loose end...

1514
01:40:07,252 --> 01:40:09,505
How did you manage
to lift Reavis' wallet?

1515
01:40:09,797 --> 01:40:11,548
You're making it up
anyway.

1516
01:40:12,174 --> 01:40:13,550
Use your imagination.

1517
01:40:15,552 --> 01:40:16,762
What do you mean? Wha...

1518
01:40:19,723 --> 01:40:21,642
While you were
doing it with him?

1519
01:40:22,476 --> 01:40:24,061
Hey,
that's pretty neat...

1520
01:40:24,728 --> 01:40:26,048
All that passion
and light fingers

1521
01:40:26,230 --> 01:40:27,815
at the same time.

1522
01:40:28,524 --> 01:40:29,524
Ooh.

1523
01:40:29,900 --> 01:40:31,694
Oh, my goodness gracious.

1524
01:40:31,902 --> 01:40:32,528
Strong!

1525
01:40:32,736 --> 01:40:33,736
Ow!

1526
01:40:33,946 --> 01:40:35,298
I can't believe
how strong you are.

1527
01:40:35,322 --> 01:40:37,074
It must come
from all that swimming.

1528
01:40:37,282 --> 01:40:38,282
Ow.

1529
01:40:38,450 --> 01:40:39,868
Oh. Now, what did you hit

1530
01:40:40,035 --> 01:40:41,275
that sweet
old lady so hard for?

1531
01:40:42,037 --> 01:40:43,637
You're not a messy kid
normally, are you,

1532
01:40:43,706 --> 01:40:45,249
or did you just
get carried away?

1533
01:40:45,457 --> 01:40:46,667
Let go of me.

1534
01:40:48,502 --> 01:40:49,962
Next thing... Iris.

1535
01:40:50,754 --> 01:40:52,756
I figured a while back
that you wrote the letter,

1536
01:40:53,215 --> 01:40:54,425
but that was
just the kickoff.

1537
01:40:54,633 --> 01:40:56,193
Wasn't it? What was
the whole game plan?

1538
01:40:56,218 --> 01:40:57,218
Shut up.

1539
01:40:57,261 --> 01:40:58,971
Hey, you heard
Iris and me

1540
01:40:59,179 --> 01:41:00,305
on the phone
last night.

1541
01:41:00,514 --> 01:41:01,514
She was pretty low.

1542
01:41:01,724 --> 01:41:02,808
I know you heard us

1543
01:41:03,017 --> 01:41:04,268
because
after she hung up,

1544
01:41:04,435 --> 01:41:05,644
there was
a second click.

1545
01:41:05,853 --> 01:41:07,104
Click goes the phone.

1546
01:41:07,271 --> 01:41:09,189
You go to her room.

1547
01:41:09,398 --> 01:41:11,483
Wait a minute.
Don't get me wrong.

1548
01:41:12,401 --> 01:41:14,361
I know you didn't shove
those sleeping pills

1549
01:41:14,570 --> 01:41:15,988
down her throat,

1550
01:41:16,196 --> 01:41:17,614
but you sure fixed it

1551
01:41:17,781 --> 01:41:20,159
so she'd do the job
for you, didn't you?

1552
01:41:20,367 --> 01:41:22,578
I don't have to listen
to any of this!

1553
01:41:22,786 --> 01:41:24,413
Whoa! Another loose end.

1554
01:41:24,580 --> 01:41:26,290
What did you tell her, huh?

1555
01:41:26,540 --> 01:41:29,835
About all those kinky things
you had going with Reavis?

1556
01:41:30,085 --> 01:41:32,085
Or maybe you described
how you killed the old lady.

1557
01:41:32,129 --> 01:41:34,214
Or worse...
Maybe you just told her

1558
01:41:34,423 --> 01:41:35,775
how miserable you were
going to make

1559
01:41:35,799 --> 01:41:36,967
the rest of her life.

1560
01:41:37,134 --> 01:41:39,636
They really
did a job on him!

1561
01:41:40,387 --> 01:41:41,805
Who, your dad?

1562
01:41:42,264 --> 01:41:45,809
I hated her! I hated
both of those bitches!

1563
01:41:47,019 --> 01:41:48,562
And you got rid
of both of them

1564
01:41:48,729 --> 01:41:50,731
so you could have daddy
all to yourself, huh?

1565
01:41:56,695 --> 01:41:59,323
Like I said, you're
a pretty bright kid.

1566
01:42:01,700 --> 01:42:03,077
But what are
you going to do

1567
01:42:03,327 --> 01:42:04,828
with all
that information?

1568
01:42:05,037 --> 01:42:06,789
Nobody's going
to believe you.

1569
01:42:08,207 --> 01:42:09,458
Well...

1570
01:42:10,584 --> 01:42:12,144
That's a funny thing
about the law, kid.

1571
01:42:12,336 --> 01:42:13,796
You know, most of the time,

1572
01:42:14,004 --> 01:42:15,798
they're not around
when you need them,

1573
01:42:16,173 --> 01:42:18,550
but there is a first time
for everything.

1574
01:42:30,354 --> 01:42:31,354
Ow!

1575
01:42:32,314 --> 01:42:33,314
Aah!

1576
01:42:34,233 --> 01:42:35,400
Oh, my god.

1577
01:42:35,609 --> 01:42:37,653
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1578
01:42:37,861 --> 01:42:38,987
I'm sorry.

1579
01:42:40,114 --> 01:42:41,824
What are you doing?

1580
01:42:42,324 --> 01:42:43,617
I hate you!

1581
01:42:43,826 --> 01:42:44,826
No.

1582
01:42:53,669 --> 01:42:56,255
Why did you
stir this up?

1583
01:42:59,216 --> 01:43:00,216
Why?

1584
01:43:00,342 --> 01:43:01,135
Tell me why!

1585
01:43:01,343 --> 01:43:04,179
Why? Why? Why? Why?

1586
01:43:05,472 --> 01:43:07,641
I'll kill you.
I'll kill you!

1587
01:43:08,100 --> 01:43:09,100
You...

1588
01:43:33,125 --> 01:43:34,501
I named her.

1589
01:43:35,627 --> 01:43:37,296
I gave her
that name.

1590
01:43:37,671 --> 01:43:39,631
She was
so pretty.

1591
01:43:40,382 --> 01:43:41,091
I...

1592
01:43:41,258 --> 01:43:42,676
I wanted her
to have...

1593
01:43:43,927 --> 01:43:46,096
Everything good
in life.

1594
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:50,726
Everything...

1595
01:43:50,934 --> 01:43:52,144
Good.

1596
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:09,953
So that's your kid
out there?

1597
01:44:11,330 --> 01:44:12,664
How are you going
to handle that?

1598
01:44:17,586 --> 01:44:19,504
Boy, I wouldn't be in
your shoes for anything.

1599
01:44:22,799 --> 01:44:24,009
Good luck.

1600
01:44:26,720 --> 01:44:27,720
Yeah.

1601
01:44:27,888 --> 01:44:29,348
Same to you.

1602
01:45:04,967 --> 01:45:06,051
Anybody home?

1603
01:45:06,593 --> 01:45:08,011
I'm out back!

1604
01:45:15,978 --> 01:45:16,978
Well, hello.

1605
01:45:17,062 --> 01:45:18,647
What brings you back?

1606
01:45:19,815 --> 01:45:21,692
Ah, I didn't want to
leave without...

1607
01:45:25,070 --> 01:45:26,863
Pat wanted me to
give you something.

1608
01:45:27,489 --> 01:45:28,489
Just before he died,

1609
01:45:28,615 --> 01:45:30,826
he said, uh, that
he really dug you.

1610
01:45:32,286 --> 01:45:33,870
Pat socked a little
away, you know,

1611
01:45:34,246 --> 01:45:35,390
and he wanted you
to have all of it.

1612
01:45:35,414 --> 01:45:36,414
Here it is.

1613
01:45:40,419 --> 01:45:42,087
9,200 bucks.

1614
01:45:52,556 --> 01:45:55,517
And, you know,
the usual message...

1615
01:45:56,310 --> 01:45:58,103
Don't spend it all
in one spot.

1616
01:46:01,481 --> 01:46:02,941
I'll see you, Gretch.

1617
01:46:06,403 --> 01:46:07,738
What about
the account book?

1618
01:46:07,988 --> 01:46:09,323
You want it or what?

1619
01:46:09,948 --> 01:46:11,283
Ah, forget it.

1620
01:46:19,833 --> 01:46:22,336
No, you take that
goddamn account book

1621
01:46:22,544 --> 01:46:23,604
and you send it
to the biggest newspaper

1622
01:46:23,628 --> 01:46:24,338
in New Orleans,

1623
01:46:24,546 --> 01:46:26,298
you got that? Ha ha.

1624
01:46:26,506 --> 01:46:27,590
That's outstanding.

1625
01:46:27,591 --> 01:46:29,259
Ha ha ha.

1626
01:46:29,468 --> 01:46:30,468
Hey!

1627
01:46:31,720 --> 01:46:33,972
I wish you'd stay a while.

1628
01:46:36,391 --> 01:46:38,518
Ah, Gretchen,
I got a plane to catch.

1629
01:46:40,520 --> 01:46:41,520
Harper...

1630
01:46:42,939 --> 01:46:44,941
You're not such
a tough guy.
