1
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:35,994
Did you feel that too?

2
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,871
- What?
- Your stomach.

3
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:39,080
It's like butterflies.

4
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:42,625
My mom said when I met
the right girl, I'd feel butterflies.

5
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:45,754
I think I'm ready.

6
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:48,089
Can you believe him?

7
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,008
He falls so easily.

8
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,593
I'm a little more guarded.

9
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:56,222
I guess it's because
I've been hurt before.

10
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:59,851
I'll never hurt you.

11
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,774
- My dad.
- My dad.

12
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,984
- You guys are sisters?
- Our dads are friends.

13
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:10,111
They went to the gym.
They're muscle-heads.

14
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:13,281
Your best bet is to curl into a ball
until they stop beating you.

15
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:18,578
I'm telling you this
because I think I might love you.

16
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:23,541
What's our play?

17
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:26,878
Run for the window. I'll get
the car keys. Y formation, dog-leg left.

18
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,340
- Ready, break.
- Break.

19
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:53,988
We should wait
two days before we call them.

20
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:57,325
You've gotta be kidding me.

21
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:02,956
Do you think they have any concept
of how fast a car can go?

22
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:15,844
Reverse kitty cat, dog-leg left,
over the fence, on my count, break.

23
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:41,828
- Hey, I'm Nick.
- Shawn. Can we use your pool?

24
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:54,507
Come on, Tigers. Yeah!

25
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:57,635
Split Johnny left!
Split Johnny left!

26
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:01,723
Come on! Come on, guys!
Set. Hike.

27
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,739
Yeah! Yeah! All day. All day.
Candy from a baby.

28
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:20,075
- What do you wanna do?
- That brunette.

29
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:23,036
Looks like she wouldn't mind
St. Nick stuffed down her chimney.

30
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:24,704
No, I mean, the play, in the game.

31
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:27,415
- Come on, guys, focus.
- I've never been more focused.

32
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,876
Check it, couple of meatloaves
in that baby tee.

33
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,628
Not mad at that belly ring either.

34
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:35,090
Have you seen this blond?
Rackety-rack, don't talk back.

35
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,925
Wonder if her carpet
matches my drapes.

36
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,968
Delay of game, loss of five yards.

37
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,388
And just because
it's a spring scrimmage...

38
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:44,140
doesn't mean you can
shit yourselves out here. Go!

39
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:47,060
- Sorry, coach.
- Go, go, go. Come on, go, go.

40
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:49,104
Tigers!

41
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:51,231
/Come on, crowd
Let's hear some noise/

42
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:53,608
/N- O-I-S-E
Noise/

43
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,443
God. See, look, we took too long.

44
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,779
Here come
the whack-ass cheerleaders, man.

45
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:01,241
/Noise, N-O-I-S-E
Noise/

46
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,910
Tigers.

47
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,795
- Well, I am pumped up.
- All right, what's the play?

48
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:16,131
Hold on,
baby tee is signing me her number.

49
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:19,968
- Is that a seven? A five and a two?
- Any day now, shit buckets.

50
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:23,054
I don't wanna run laps all afternoon.
I have a shrink appointment.

51
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:27,142
Dude, your cousin stuck his finger
in your ass. Get over it.

52
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:30,478
They playing us loose. Let's
get short passes and extra yardage.

53
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,732
The hell with that, man.
You either bet big or go home.

54
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,776
- You gotta risk it to get the biscuit.
- Aye, my brother.

55
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:40,822
All right. Pro-zoom trips, deep route,
slant slim boogie on my count. Ready?

56
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:42,949
Break.

57
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,785
54s and Mike, watch that blitz.

58
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,913
Blue 17, set, hut.

59
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,673
Come on, Shawn.

60
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,926
Come on, baby. Yeah!

61
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:17,859
- Hey, I'm Nick.
- Shawn.

62
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,866
- Hey, Shawn.
- Hey, Maddy.

63
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:28,161
Thanks for helping me study Bio.
I'm retarded about reverse osmosis.

64
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:29,371
No, you're not.

65
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:32,040
Pressure forcing a solvent
through a membrane...

66
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:35,126
like when a water balloon
gets too big and then explodes.

67
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:38,922
Got it. Thanks. You're so awesome.

68
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:41,466
No. Science is awesome.

69
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:44,010
And you're awesome.
Now, go crush that test.

70
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,137
- Thanks.
- High five.

71
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,306
Nick. Hey, Nick.

72
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,433
- Name, name. I need a name.
- Jennifer.

73
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:53,395
- Jennifer, hi, how are you?
- I'm great. Really great.

74
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:56,022
- Are you going to the bonfire tonight?
- You know it.

75
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,774
I was just saying to Shawn here...

76
00:05:57,816 --> 00:06:01,277
I cannot wait to go to the bonfire
so I can hang out with...

77
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,698
- Jennifer.
- Jennifer.

78
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:09,577
- I'll see you tonight.
- Okay, Jennifer.

79
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:13,248
- It's not that hard a name to remember.
- I went out with her last semester.

80
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,667
The name gets erased
to make room for new ones.

81
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:19,421
- There's like 3000 kids at this school.
- Can't you just remember more names?

82
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,423
I don't know how it works.
Talk to Tech Support.

83
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,800
- There are my guys.
- Let's bet how many times...

84
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:26,219
- ... he says "shit. " I say seven.
- No way, 10.

85
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:27,595
- Hey, coach.
- Hey, coach.

86
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,264
Shitheads think you're the shit?

87
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:31,599
That you don't need
to pay attention out there?

88
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:35,186
I'll kick the shit out of you.
You pumped for football camp?

89
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,355
- I guess so.
- Yeah, two weeks without girls.

90
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,442
- Who wouldn't be pumped?
- Don't mess with me, shit-dick.

91
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:43,236
I am gonna push you like you've
never been pushed before.

92
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:45,447
Your muscles will ache,
your head will throb.

93
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:48,324
You'll shit blood out of holes
you never knew you had.

94
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,660
At least we're gonna
be in Daytona Beach.

95
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:54,914
No. Change it up this year.
Camp's gonna be in El Paso, Texas.

96
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,916
Hotter than your shithole.

97
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,127
We're gonna get
you shits conditioned.

98
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:02,297
Bus leaves Monday
at 0-shit-hundred hours.

99
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,549
- Which is?
-4:45 a. m.

100
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,134
- Of course.
- The usual.

101
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:10,638
Skip your morning shit
and get down here.

102
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:13,350
Ten "shits," you win.
How do you always know?

103
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:17,354
It's a gift. I'm not proud of it.

104
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,647
Bye.

105
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,984
Maybe I'll see you
sometime this summer.

106
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,986
Don't be obvious.
He knows you like him.

107
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,988
You guys coming
to my dad's after camp?

108
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,324
- Hells, yeah. He gave it to you again?
- Nice.

109
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:31,493
He figures if he lets
me have it one week...

110
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:34,287
I'll forgive him for not being there
when I need him.

111
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:37,123
And guess what. He's right.

112
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:40,669
Did you hear football camp's gonna
be in El Paso? How cool is that?

113
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,338
We gonna be sweating, hallucinating,
our skin burning.

114
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,007
Like being on shrooms,
but without girls to yell at us.

115
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:52,305
"Where's the car? Where's the car?
I'm getting scared. Hold my purse. "

116
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:56,935
- Two weeks, Shawn. Two weeks.
- I know.

117
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,187
Two weeks out of the best
years of our lives.

118
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,731
Two weeks we're never
gonna get back, like, ever.

119
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:03,775
I know.

120
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,194
So are you guys psyched
for cheer camp or what?

121
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:07,821
It's, like, all I think about.

122
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:11,074
Know how Martin Luther King
had a dream? Well, I do too.

123
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:15,537
To kick ass at cheer camp. And if
that makes me shallow, then fine.

124
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:20,208
- Call me and Dr. King shallow.
- That doesn't make you shallow.

125
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,085
That makes you real.

126
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:24,212
We have got to do better
than last year.

127
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:28,091
We could take a dump in our pants
and still do better than last year.

128
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,677
- I'm just saying.
- But we're better this year.

129
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,888
And if we work hard,
I think we have a real shot.

130
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,266
I don't know.
There's 300 girls up there...

131
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,435
who want it just as much
as we do.

132
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:41,229
- And who are much better than us.
- Three hundred girls.

133
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:44,190
Who want it just as much as we do.

134
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:47,402
And are much better than us.

135
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:49,863
Tell you what, man,
that'd be the place to be.

136
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:55,410
Instead of sweating our balls off
in the desert with Coach Shit-Shit.

137
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,704
- So let's go.
- What?

138
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:59,706
Let's go to cheer camp,
be cheerleaders.

139
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:01,499
- Cheerleaders?
- Yes.

140
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,710
Oh, my God.
Are you coming out to me?

141
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:05,503
I'm so proud of you, man.

142
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,964
And you know what,
I kind of always knew.

143
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:10,717
Will you shut up. All right,
I'm too straight to be gay.

144
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,761
I could suck knob
and still be straight.

145
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,221
I could have one in my mouth
and two in each hand...

146
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,766
- ... and still win a straight award.
- All right.

147
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:20,602
Which is why I wanna go
to cheer camp. Think.

148
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,980
Three hundred hotties
we've never been with before.

149
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:26,983
I wonder if they let guys
go to cheer camp.

150
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:28,735
Name, name. Give me a name.

151
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:30,779
- Carly. She's the captain.
- Hey, Carly.

152
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,532
Yeah, I know, it's the most beautiful
name you've ever heard...

153
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,284
my eyes look like forever...

154
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:39,621
and you love every bone in my body,
especially yours.

155
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,664
No, but that's good.
Mind if I use it?

156
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,083
No, no. No lines.

157
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,168
We wanted to wish you
luck at cheer camp.

158
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:48,880
Sure, you do. I know your game.
No girl left unturned.

159
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,465
- What?
- How dare you?

160
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:53,176
No. We just see how hard
you ladies cheer out there...

161
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:55,220
and we really hope
that you do good.

162
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:59,391
Yeah, do us proud, you know. Beat
the skirts off those 300 other girls.

163
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,602
And guys? Are there guys there?
Do guys go?

164
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:05,063
- What about guys?
- It's a good question.

165
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,774
There's girls and guys that go.
I don't know if guys-

166
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:09,901
Yes. The good teams are all co-ed.

167
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:13,446
That's interesting. I just didn't
know that. I was just pondering.

168
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:16,908
Carly, come here. We're working on
a new mount Bianca came up with.

169
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,369
- Yeah!
- Coming.

170
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:23,289
I'm gonna walk away backwards,
so you guys don't talk about my ass.

171
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:26,292
Man, she's got nice lumps.
Either one of us ever hit that?

172
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:29,129
I don't think so. I think
she respects herself too much.

173
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,422
Right.

174
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,424
Who wants to deal with that drama?

175
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,343
So, what do you think
about cheer camp?

176
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,721
- What do you mean, what do I think?
- Let's go.

177
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:40,765
- We're not cheerleaders.
- We're athletes, we can do anything.

178
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,852
They don't just let anybody go.
You've gotta be part of a squad.

179
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,895
Let's join a squad.
How hard can this be?

180
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,856
A couple of flips, a pyramid.

181
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,190
/Black sheep/

182
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,067
Three hundred honeys
on our biscuits.

183
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:54,195
- What about football camp?
- Screw football.

184
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:57,240
The only reason we started playing
was to pull chicks.

185
00:10:57,282 --> 00:11:00,785
You can't honestly tell me you enjoy
running in blazing hot pads...

186
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:04,330
trying to catch a pass two seconds
before some 2000-pound mongoloid...

187
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:07,709
- ... crashes into your Nutter Butters.
- El Paso, here we come.

188
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:11,004
Not if it comes to us first!

189
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:12,714
Oh, shit.

190
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:14,257
- I'm on fire.
- Mookie!

191
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:17,469
- Water, water, water.
- I'll put you out.

192
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,554
I'm a hero.

193
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:22,390
Screw football. Let's go cheer.

194
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:25,226
Shawny Shawn!

195
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,896
We need to convince
the squad they need us.

196
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,357
- Not gonna be easy.
- That's why we go to Poppy.

197
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,525
- I wish there was another way.
- There's not.

198
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:35,070
- But I wish there was.
- But there's not. We're here.

199
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:39,157
- I wish we weren't.
- But we are.

200
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:41,242
Hi, sis.

201
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:43,203
Why am I looking at you? Speak.

202
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,622
Poppy, you're getting so big now.
How old are you?

203
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:48,375
I'm 60. Can we get past
the small talk?

204
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:52,087
The only time you come to see me
is when you need something.

205
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,880
What? Tug mags?

206
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:56,007
Mike's Hard Lemonade?

207
00:11:56,049 --> 00:12:00,261
- Another ride to the clinic?
- Poppy.

208
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:04,099
No. We wanna go to that
cheerleading camp you're going to.

209
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,602
Since you're killing on the JV squad
and so advanced beyond your years...

210
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,437
we thought you'd get us
up to speed.

211
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,648
Hey, buddy,
you can piss on my face...

212
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:14,567
just don't tell me it's raining.

213
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:17,112
You guys have been through
every girl at your school...

214
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,364
and you're looking
for fresh muff.

215
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:22,075
Some itchy-itchy-nah-nah.
Wall-to-wall carpet.

216
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:24,285
Okay, seriously, how old are you?

217
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:27,622
Tell you what, I'll teach you
some basic cheerleader moves.

218
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,958
High V's, low V's,
touchdown, baskets.

219
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,128
Don't the guys just throw
the girls up and then catch them?

220
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:36,881
Pretty much. But I'll let you practice
on me and tell you what they're called.

221
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:39,134
In exchange, I get Shawn's room.

222
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,427
- No.
- Done.

223
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,970
Those are my terms.

224
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:44,389
- We'll take them.
- Dude, I've got my own bathroom.

225
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:47,475
Dude, after cheer camp, you won't
even need your own bathroom.

226
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:49,227
What? What does that even mean?

227
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:52,105
Poppy, you got yourself a deal.
Teach us, we go see Carly.

228
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:54,190
- Wrong, Gossip Girl.
- What?

229
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:57,277
Carly's not one of your humpety-hump
football groupies.

230
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:00,530
She's too smart to buy that you guys
wanna be cheerleaders.

231
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:04,117
Okay, so, what's the play?

232
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:13,126
- Here she comes, here she comes.
- Go, go. Get up there.

233
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:14,627
Oh, rats.

234
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:17,464
- We got our Frisbee stuck.
- How are we gonna get it down?

235
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,716
- Go space shuttle.
- That's what I'm thinking.

236
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:21,134
Good idea.

237
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:23,178
- Ready?
- Okay.

238
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:28,767
/One, two, three, four, five, six
Seven, grab, drop, catch/

239
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:33,021
- Great job.
- Go, buddy.

240
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:35,023
Do they always get
so excited like that?

241
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:37,776
Haven't you ever seen them
do their touchdown dances?

242
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:42,072
I mean, they flip all over the place.
You'd think they were cheerleaders.

243
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:44,199
- No.
- You guys really like cheering?

244
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,368
That wasn't cheering,
just goofing around.

245
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,495
You nailed a backward sponge
and go cradle.

246
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,206
No. We threw my sister up in the air
to get our Frisbee.

247
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,500
It was either that
or we get three ladders.

248
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,709
Come on, guys.

249
00:13:54,751 --> 00:14:00,298
You love cheering. Don't run from it.
This is a safe place.

250
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:03,343
We kind of do. It's so much
more athletic than football.

251
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:06,596
If it were up to us, we'd go
with you ladies to cheer camp.

252
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:08,556
But we're football meatheads.

253
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:11,226
We gotta march in lockstep
to what society expects.

254
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:14,020
Don't tell anyone, okay?
Totally ruin our rep.

255
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:16,189
- We'll catch you later.
- Have a good summer.

256
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:18,358
We're gonna go watch
a Bears' game on TV.

257
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,069
/Go, Bears/

258
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:35,500
I'm supposed to believe
the biggest jocks in school...

259
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,794
all along really wanted
to be cheerleaders?

260
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:41,172
Don't get caught up in the lockstep
of society's expectations.

261
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,258
They tossed Poppy
like 20 feet in the air.

262
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,760
Look, Carly,
we don't have any muscle.

263
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:49,889
If you really wanna do better this year,
they're our only hope.

264
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:53,643
Unless you guys wanna try steroids,
which I'm totally open to.

265
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:57,272
- I'm just saying.
- I don't care. I don't trust those guys.

266
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,733
They're not coming. I'm the captain.

267
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:05,113
Miss Klingerhoff is the coach.
Let's see what she thinks.

268
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:08,491
What a fantastic idea.

269
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:12,620
It's exactly what this squad needs
to just push it over the top.

270
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:15,248
But Miss Klingerhoff,
they have never done it before.

271
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:20,378
They don't know any of our cheers,
and, come on, it's Nick and Shawn.

272
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,547
Don't judge a book
by its cover, Carly.

273
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:27,093
You never really know what a book
is about until you get to page 50.

274
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,137
Fifty?

275
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:33,933
- Wouldn't guess a page over 40.
- More like 35.

276
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:36,186
My chickens.

277
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:39,356
You come here, you.

278
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:45,278
All right. One down, one to go.

279
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,656
What are we gonna say to Coach
Shit-For-Words to get out of football?

280
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:54,037
What every kid says to get out
of everything he doesn't wanna do.

281
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,831
So not only do I find out yesterday
I'm adopted...

282
00:15:56,873 --> 00:16:00,001
the people I've called mom and
dad are infertile imposters...

283
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:03,296
who bought me outside a meth clinic
for two boxes of Sudafed...

284
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:05,965
but I also get
this news dropped on me:

285
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:09,177
My birth father, Bruce...

286
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:12,222
well, he needs a kidney
and I'm the only match.

287
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:14,974
And apparently Bruce needs it stat.

288
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:17,644
You need it stat, Bruce? Huh?

289
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:20,522
I needed a father stat
instead of the stay-at-home dad...

290
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:25,318
who showers me with love every
day, this goddamn spermless liar!

291
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,530
So now I gotta be at Kaiser
Permanente tomorrow at 6 a. m.

292
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:32,117
I know. Bruce couldn't even afford
a real hospital.

293
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:35,370
Managed care. It's ironic, huh?

294
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:37,247
Never managed to care for me.

295
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:39,332
You shitting me?

296
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:41,584
Are you saying you can't go to camp?

297
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:44,004
Yeah, but don't make me say it,
coach.

298
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:49,175
Because it's eating me up inside.
It's eating me up.

299
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:52,762
Shit!

300
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:55,056
- Cheer camp! Cheer camp!
- One, two.

301
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:56,391
- Cheer camp! Cheer camp!
- One, two.

302
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:58,852
Cheer camp! One, two.

303
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:01,938
You might have everyone else fooled,
but not me.

304
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,941
Well, if being a fool
for cheering is wrong...

305
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:06,693
then I don't wanna be right.

306
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:09,320
You might wanna dial back
your bullshit with her.

307
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,780
She seems pretty with-it.

308
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:14,492
That's a great note. Thanks.

309
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,372
We're so psyched you're here.

310
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:21,666
- Yeah, us too. Oh, yeah.
- Me too, yeah, yeah.

311
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:22,917
Don't worry about Carly.

312
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,128
- She's really into cheering.
- No worries.

313
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,964
/We are driving
We, we are driving/

314
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:31,426
/We are driving
We, we are driving/

315
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:34,721
/We like driving
We, we like driving/

316
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:38,308
/We like driving
We, we like driving/

317
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:41,686
/- We are eating
- We, we are eating/

318
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:45,231
/We are driving again
We are driving/

319
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:48,151
/We are driving again
We are driving/

320
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:51,404
- How long does this go on for?
- The whole way.

321
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:55,200
Just wait till their cycles match up.
You'll miss these days.

322
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,243
We're gonna miss
Mookie's dad's house.

323
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:59,996
Oh, buddy, we are not missing
Mookie's dad's house.

324
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:01,956
Yeah.
This thing is three weeks long.

325
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:07,629
Not for us, it isn't. We hook up
like maniacs, we bail in two.

326
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:09,756
That's probably gonna piss
some people off.

327
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:11,966
To make an omelet,
you gotta break some eggs.

328
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:15,470
Grated cheese, slice some mushrooms,
salt, pepper, don't over-beat.

329
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:18,223
/We are driving again
We are driving/

330
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:21,643
/We are driving again
We are driving/

331
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:23,937
/We are driving again
We are driving/

332
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,230
Sorry.

333
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:29,359
I should say so, handsy.
At least buy me dinner first.

334
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:32,070
Very funny.

335
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:38,785
All right, now you're just
taking advantage of me.

336
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:43,832
/We are here
We, we are here/

337
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,626
I think we made a big mistake.

338
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:49,504
We may have screwed the pooch
on this one.

339
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:52,132
Or maybe the pooch
is gonna screw us.

340
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:55,510
Sweet Mary in a D-cup.

341
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:41,598
I think our bus crashed
and we're in heaven.

342
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:43,600
No. We would've heard:

343
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:47,979
/"We are crashing
We, we are crashing"/

344
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:50,607
Let's go see how warm the water is.

345
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:53,443
- Hi. Do I know you?
- I don't think so.

346
00:19:53,485 --> 00:19:57,113
Well, I'm Nick. I'm new this year.
Maybe you could show me around.

347
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:59,741
- Who's this?
- Nick. He's new this year.

348
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:02,077
This is Shawn, also new,
needs showing around.

349
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:04,704
- If it's not too much trouble.
- You gotta check in.

350
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:05,955
Okay, coming.

351
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:08,708
It was very nice meeting you.
Hope we see you around.

352
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:14,839
I'll put a bookmark between you.
That way we know where we left off.

353
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:20,929
Hi. What squad are you on?

354
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:27,352
/Diora. I believe that's Italiano
for "beautiful princess. "/

355
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:28,728
- No.
- Well, it should be.

356
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,606
- I'm calling the dictionary people.
- What squad are you on?

357
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:33,274
The Tigers, Gerald R. Ford High.

358
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:36,194
Below-average president,
above-average student body.

359
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:38,571
So, what are you doing later?

360
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:40,615
Not you.

361
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:42,492
What about accents?
You like Aussies?

362
00:20:42,534 --> 00:20:44,619
You wanna wear my leather hat?

363
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:49,290
Mascots, I'll be checking you in
in 10 minutes at the mascot table.

364
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:54,254
- Why are you still here?
- You like canopy beds?

365
00:20:54,713 --> 00:20:59,342
The last bus from Bitchville
just pulled in.

366
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:02,971
- Who's that?
- The Panthers.

367
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:08,143
They always come in first
and they don't let anyone forget it.

368
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:12,814
You guys came back.
I think that's so brave.

369
00:21:12,856 --> 00:21:15,400
I just hope one day
there's a special cheer camp...

370
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:18,403
where squads like yours
really have a shot.

371
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:19,612
- Shut up.
- Truth hurts.

372
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:22,282
- Your face is gonna hurt.
- Does your face hurt...

373
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:25,744
- ... when you stuff it with pie?
- You wish you had my body image.

374
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:29,205
I'm healthy. Unlike you, Skeletor.

375
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:31,291
We're a different team this year,
Gwyneth.

376
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:34,044
Meet our new squad members.

377
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:35,503
I'm Nick. This is Shawn.

378
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:37,505
Hi. Great to meet you.

379
00:21:37,547 --> 00:21:42,510
So you got a little sausage
in your soup this year. BFD.

380
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:45,472
- See you on the cheer field.
- It's that big chunk of grass...

381
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:47,265
you come in last on, every year.

382
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:50,101
Panthers out.

383
00:21:57,901 --> 00:21:59,361
Panthers out?

384
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:01,154
What are they, a knife gang?

385
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:05,200
- God, I hate them.
- I think they're kind of cool.

386
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:08,203
I'm just saying.

387
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:19,589
Hey. I'm Nick. This is Shawn.

388
00:22:19,631 --> 00:22:22,050
I'm Brewster.

389
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:23,301
Not my real name.

390
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:25,095
My parents named me Jack.

391
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:29,766
Jack, so strong, so masculine.
We get it. You wanted a boy.

392
00:22:29,808 --> 00:22:33,728
My name's Jack. I punch bad guys,
and I kiss girls.

393
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:35,772
- Save it.
- Okay.

394
00:22:35,814 --> 00:22:40,402
/Now, just a quick FY información,
I'm kind of a neat freak.../

395
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:45,573
so we'll get along great if you
just keep your area clean.

396
00:22:45,615 --> 00:22:46,908
And by "area," you mean?

397
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,035
- Your bunks.
- Okay.

398
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:51,579
I can't stand clutter.
That's why we left Calcutta.

399
00:22:51,621 --> 00:22:54,582
Well, that and my dad
took a job with United Airlines.

400
00:22:54,624 --> 00:22:57,168
Your jobs aren't just
going over there, sailor.

401
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:01,256
Some of us are coming over here.
The world is flat like a son of a bitch.

402
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:05,093
You're giving us a lot to process here.

403
00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:07,137
Hey, what's up, guys? I'm Adam.

404
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:10,390
What's up, man?
Hey, I'm Nick. This is Shawn.

405
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:11,599
Well, welcome, welcome.

406
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:14,769
- Is that your girlfriend?
- Yeah.

407
00:23:14,811 --> 00:23:18,606
That's Jody. We've been cheering
together since we were 5.

408
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:20,025
So you take this seriously?

409
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:23,611
I wanna be the first in my family to
go to college on a cheer scholarship.

410
00:23:23,653 --> 00:23:26,156
Good luck, man.
I hope you break the cycle.

411
00:23:26,197 --> 00:23:27,490
- Thanks, man.
- Cool.

412
00:23:27,532 --> 00:23:29,951
What's up, Eagle?

413
00:23:29,993 --> 00:23:32,537
Mascots don't talk. They just gesture.

414
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:36,291
- Even in their bunks?
- The whole time, baby girl.

415
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:37,834
It's total immersion.

416
00:23:37,876 --> 00:23:40,086
Hey. Can someone
help me with my stuff?

417
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:43,548
I got a huge bag of footballs,
beer, Xbox games.

418
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,091
Let's get this party started.

419
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:47,635
Finally, a kindred spirit.
I'm Nick. This is Shawn.

420
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:49,846
- I'm Downey.
- What's up? Nice to meet you.

421
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:53,141
Downey. Downey. All right,
so break it down for us.

422
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:55,226
How great is this place?

423
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:57,729
- It's sick, dude.
- Sweet. Right there.

424
00:23:57,771 --> 00:24:01,232
The coaches are amazing. Your
cheering's gonna be off the charts.

425
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:04,486
My cheering's gonna be off the charts.
I guess that's a good thing.

426
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:06,905
What about the ladies?
Tell me about the ladies.

427
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:10,033
Oh, yeah, totally.

428
00:24:11,034 --> 00:24:16,039
Their cheering gets better too.
They see real progress.

429
00:24:16,081 --> 00:24:18,208
What the...?

430
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:23,046
Wow, look at them all, dude. In rows.
It's like the hot-chick produce aisle.

431
00:24:23,088 --> 00:24:24,589
I don't know where to start.

432
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:27,384
Do we go from tall to short
or blond to redhead?

433
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:29,594
Maybe just iPod-shuffle mode.

434
00:24:29,636 --> 00:24:33,014
This is why I'd never wanna
be president. Too many decisions.

435
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:35,350
Don't worry,
I don't think that's in the cards.

436
00:24:35,392 --> 00:24:39,521
You say that now, but George W.
was a cheerleader at Yale.

437
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:41,398
He never thought
he'd be president...

438
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:44,859
snorting coke through his skull and
bones at a New Haven titty bar.

439
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:46,695
You just never know, Shawnzy.

440
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:50,323
And that is what makes America great.
Any idiot can be president.

441
00:24:50,365 --> 00:24:53,451
- Let's hear some noise over here!
- Noise over here!

442
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:56,162
- Let's hear some noise over here!
- Noise over here!

443
00:24:56,204 --> 00:24:58,707
- Are you fired up?
- We're fired up!

444
00:24:58,748 --> 00:25:01,209
- Are you fired up?
- We're fired up!

445
00:25:01,251 --> 00:25:03,211
- How do you spell "fired up"?
- F-U!

446
00:25:03,253 --> 00:25:04,713
Not really.

447
00:25:04,754 --> 00:25:07,007
- How do you spell "fired up"?
- F-U!

448
00:25:07,048 --> 00:25:09,134
- What's that spell?
- Fired up!

449
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:10,844
- Not really that way either.
- Nope.

450
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:14,347
Damn straight. F-U.
You're at university now.

451
00:25:14,389 --> 00:25:16,266
- Fired Up University.
- This is awesome.

452
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:19,728
Cheer college, my friends. None
of this high school stuff for you.

453
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:23,732
You got three weeks. We're gonna
take it right to the top to F-U.

454
00:25:23,773 --> 00:25:26,568
- F-U!
- F-U!

455
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:31,448
Howdy do? My name is Coach Keith.
I'm the skipper of this spirit ship.

456
00:25:31,489 --> 00:25:35,243
As many of you know, I was
the very first male cheerleader ever...

457
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:37,412
to compete at the Nationals.

458
00:25:37,454 --> 00:25:39,456
I was born cheering.

459
00:25:39,497 --> 00:25:42,208
My mother swears
the first thing out of her what's-it...

460
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:47,630
was a little pair of baby hands
doing spirit fingers.

461
00:25:48,256 --> 00:25:51,384
That's a joke, but it really happened.

462
00:25:51,426 --> 00:25:53,511
It is now my absolute pleasure...

463
00:25:53,553 --> 00:25:55,764
to introduce to you
your head counselor...

464
00:25:55,805 --> 00:26:01,895
and my super-sexy handsome wife,
Diora. Let's bring her out here.

465
00:26:05,482 --> 00:26:07,942
- What? Did he say wife?
- No, he couldn't have.

466
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:09,194
Welcome, everyone.

467
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:12,906
For the next three weeks, you'll train
with me and the other coaches...

468
00:26:12,947 --> 00:26:14,866
and then compete in a tournament...

469
00:26:14,908 --> 00:26:19,954
with the top teams going on
to the State Finals.

470
00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:25,669
So that would be the Panthers
and two other teams.

471
00:26:25,835 --> 00:26:28,463
- Oh, me, me, me.
- Yes, ma'am, right here.

472
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:32,175
I heard that there was this really hard
move called the Fountain of Troy...

473
00:26:32,217 --> 00:26:34,135
that some team did at the Worlds.

474
00:26:34,177 --> 00:26:35,470
Are we gonna learn that?

475
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:39,641
Sure, I'll teach you
how to do the Fountain of Troy.

476
00:26:39,683 --> 00:26:43,144
Then I'll teach you
to put makeup on a bear!

477
00:26:43,186 --> 00:26:44,979
Absolutely not.

478
00:26:45,021 --> 00:26:48,858
Not only is that move nearly impossible
to execute, it's extremely dangerous.

479
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,860
That move is prohibidado.

480
00:26:50,902 --> 00:26:53,071
- Prohibi-what?
- Prohibidado.

481
00:26:53,113 --> 00:26:57,909
And I say that in Spanish because
that's how exotic and not-allowed it is.

482
00:26:57,951 --> 00:27:00,829
You can't even say "Fountain of Troy"
at this cheer camp.

483
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:03,415
- Go ahead and say it.
- Fountain of Tr-!

484
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:06,209
Stop it. What are you doing?
This isn't a game.

485
00:27:06,251 --> 00:27:08,003
I'm not playing around up here.

486
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:10,422
Honey.

487
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:13,341
It's just a joke.
First week of cheer camp.

488
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:14,592
Lighten things up.

489
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:17,262
Have a good time.
Everybody say it, "Fountain of Troy. "

490
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:20,515
- Fountain of Tr-!
- Oh, my dear Lord! Oh, gosh, shut up!

491
00:27:20,557 --> 00:27:22,517
He's lost his mind.

492
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,520
Stop it! Nobody does the
Fountain of Troy at this cheer camp.

493
00:27:25,562 --> 00:27:28,189
Now, let's all hit the bunks
and get a good night's sleep.

494
00:27:28,231 --> 00:27:31,568
Welcome to cheer camp.

495
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:43,788
Hi.

496
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:47,667
Dibs, dibs. Dibs on the blond
with the butterfly tattoo.

497
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:49,961
Dibs on that. I'd like that.
Tell me who it is.

498
00:27:50,003 --> 00:27:52,213
- This is Lanie Brown.
- Lanie Brown.

499
00:27:52,255 --> 00:27:55,633
She likes skiing, hip-hop, and playing
with her cat, Sir Pembleton.

500
00:27:55,675 --> 00:27:58,219
- Sir Pembleton? You serious?
- I know, I'm not kidding.

501
00:27:58,261 --> 00:28:00,638
I'm gonna write her name
in my book in no time.

502
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,724
Can't believe you document
your conquests.

503
00:28:02,766 --> 00:28:05,143
Family owns a payroll company.
Love records.

504
00:28:05,185 --> 00:28:07,312
- It's just weird.
- Tell it to our dog, FICA.

505
00:28:07,354 --> 00:28:08,646
Oh, hey, Carly.

506
00:28:08,688 --> 00:28:10,357
What's up, Tigers?

507
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:12,150
- Hey.
- Going to take a shower?

508
00:28:12,192 --> 00:28:14,903
Yeah. I had my hand
in some kid's mouth this morning.

509
00:28:14,944 --> 00:28:17,739
Good idea. I know where it's been.

510
00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:20,742
And if I don't get some
flesh-eating virus from that...

511
00:28:20,784 --> 00:28:23,203
I probably will
after I take a shower barefoot.

512
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:25,997
- I forgot to pack my flip-flops.
- Sucks! See you later.

513
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:29,250
Oh, here. Take mine.

514
00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:31,503
- I brought two pair.
- Really?

515
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:34,631
Yeah. No problem.
We're teammates.

516
00:28:34,673 --> 00:28:37,092
Thanks.

517
00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:42,347
- Bye.
- See you later.

518
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:46,393
Bro, what did I tell you? No hooking
up with girls from our school.

519
00:28:46,434 --> 00:28:48,687
- I was just being nice.
- I don't care, man.

520
00:28:48,728 --> 00:28:50,188
You know where nice leads.

521
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:52,482
Do not poop where you eat,
remember?

522
00:28:52,524 --> 00:28:57,237
That's why there are no
restaurants called The Bathroom.

523
00:28:57,278 --> 00:28:59,989
There are bathrooms at restaurants.

524
00:29:00,031 --> 00:29:01,783
I was using a metaphor, Shawn.

525
00:29:01,825 --> 00:29:06,621
It is crazy that people think
that you're the smart one.

526
00:29:06,663 --> 00:29:08,415
What's up, ladies?

527
00:29:08,456 --> 00:29:09,833
Hi.

528
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:15,422
You wanna borrow some flip-flops?
All right, see you later.

529
00:29:18,008 --> 00:29:21,136
Welcome to day one, everybody.
Let's start with a warm-up run.

530
00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:25,306
God, she's such a fox. I guarantee
I'm gonna tap that before we leave.

531
00:29:25,348 --> 00:29:28,059
Dude, she's married,
and like 30 years old.

532
00:29:28,101 --> 00:29:31,354
That's just how I like them:
ancient and regretful.

533
00:29:31,396 --> 00:29:33,648
Yeah. Take it easy on the Dove bars.

534
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:35,650
- Ready, Shawnzy?
- Sure am, Nicholai.

535
00:29:35,692 --> 00:29:38,903
New guys, move them.

536
00:29:41,031 --> 00:29:43,783
I always knew there was
something else I should be doing.

537
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:47,203
You know,
like there was something more.

538
00:29:47,245 --> 00:29:49,289
Something more inside me.

539
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:54,044
I guess you could say
I had a cheer waiting to get out.

540
00:29:54,085 --> 00:29:57,964
And now, well, I live to cheer.

541
00:29:58,381 --> 00:30:01,593
And I cheer to live.

542
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:09,017
I looked that little kitten
in the eyes...

543
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:10,935
and I knew I had to take her home.

544
00:30:10,977 --> 00:30:15,523
And now, Sniffles,
that's who I tell my secrets to.

545
00:30:15,565 --> 00:30:17,609
My grandmother was a cheerleader.

546
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:20,070
It was what she loved most
in the world.

547
00:30:20,111 --> 00:30:25,367
So when she died, I just
picked up the family pom-poms.

548
00:30:25,408 --> 00:30:28,828
This is weird.
I don't usually open up like this.

549
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:33,625
It's weird.
I don't usually open up like this.

550
00:30:58,108 --> 00:31:00,652
/Tigers!/

551
00:31:00,694 --> 00:31:02,821
I love every bone in your body.

552
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:05,990
Especially mine...?

553
00:31:28,555 --> 00:31:31,099
/Tigers!/

554
00:31:42,944 --> 00:31:46,573
/Tigers can't be beat
Get up on your feet/

555
00:31:46,614 --> 00:31:48,324
/Tigers can't be beat/

556
00:31:48,366 --> 00:31:51,369
Is it my imagination, or do they
not completely, totally suck?

557
00:31:51,411 --> 00:31:53,329
It's your imagination.

558
00:31:53,371 --> 00:31:56,124
Now go imagine me
a bottle of water.

559
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:58,710
/Tigers!/

560
00:32:05,925 --> 00:32:09,054
The French say a day moon brings
good luck to whoever sees it.

561
00:32:09,095 --> 00:32:11,264
They also say 8-year-olds
should drink wine.

562
00:32:11,306 --> 00:32:15,852
And if it's a crescent moon,
it'll bring good luck for a week.

563
00:32:15,894 --> 00:32:17,395
What is it now?

564
00:32:17,437 --> 00:32:21,316
I'm jogging with the captain of the best
squad, so I'd say it's pretty crescent.

565
00:32:21,358 --> 00:32:23,276
- Race you.
- Cheering isn't a race.

566
00:32:23,318 --> 00:32:26,363
- This isn't football.
- There's a competition at the end.

567
00:32:26,404 --> 00:32:29,699
Yeah, you're right.
On your mark, get set...

568
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:31,826
Oh, she cheats. I like it.

569
00:32:31,868 --> 00:32:33,870
Zucchini?

570
00:32:33,912 --> 00:32:36,956
Leafy greens? Kale? Jicama?

571
00:32:36,998 --> 00:32:38,166
And sprouts?

572
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:40,669
That's the only thing
that sucks about cheer camp.

573
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,671
The sacrifices
I make for ass.

574
00:32:42,712 --> 00:32:45,757
Remember when I pretended to
be into Nickelback for that chick?

575
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:48,885
- God, they suck.
- So did she. Up top.

576
00:32:48,927 --> 00:32:53,014
Dude, I am not gonna high-five you
for a beejer you got a year ago.

577
00:32:53,056 --> 00:32:55,850
That doesn't count. No.

578
00:32:55,892 --> 00:32:57,352
- Poppy.
- Hi, sis.

579
00:32:57,394 --> 00:32:59,187
Guys looking to go off-menu?

580
00:32:59,229 --> 00:33:02,982
I got Kit Kats, Snickers,
and German sweet tarts.

581
00:33:03,024 --> 00:33:07,362
Wipes out the taste
of every other candy.

582
00:33:07,404 --> 00:33:09,531
I'll take everything you got.

583
00:33:09,572 --> 00:33:12,701
Not here, Shawshank.
The screws are watching.

584
00:33:12,742 --> 00:33:16,329
Put it in the sycamore tree
out back.

585
00:33:16,371 --> 00:33:21,418
- Where's our candy gonna be?
- Check your pockets.

586
00:33:23,294 --> 00:33:26,965
I know. She's got the shine.

587
00:33:31,177 --> 00:33:34,222
Oh, my God, this is so good.

588
00:33:34,264 --> 00:33:36,975
Yeah, it is.

589
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,477
Diora!

590
00:33:41,688 --> 00:33:44,065
Diora!

591
00:33:44,607 --> 00:33:45,734
God, it is you.

592
00:33:45,775 --> 00:33:47,819
The way the moonlight
caught your cheek...

593
00:33:47,861 --> 00:33:50,321
for a second there,
I thought you were an angel.

594
00:33:50,363 --> 00:33:52,490
Nope, just the head
counselor who decides...

595
00:33:52,532 --> 00:33:56,453
whether or not to make you
run laps all tomorrow.

596
00:33:56,494 --> 00:33:58,538
God, I love it, huh?

597
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:01,833
A little back and forth, witty repartee,
Hepburn and Tracy.

598
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:04,085
I'm not 16, kiddo.
Run along and play.

599
00:34:04,127 --> 00:34:06,421
Still with the witty repartee,
that's terrific.

600
00:34:06,463 --> 00:34:10,050
- You win this round, Miss Tracy.
- Hepburn was the girl.

601
00:34:10,091 --> 00:34:13,345
Ding, ding. Knockout.

602
00:34:15,472 --> 00:34:18,308
It shouldn't be this hard,
she's like 100 years old.

603
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:22,520
- Shawn. Got a second?
- Yeah. Sure.

604
00:34:23,063 --> 00:34:25,815
Some of the girls have been
talking about you and Nick.

605
00:34:25,857 --> 00:34:28,068
Don't believe anything anyone says.

606
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:32,030
They've been saying they think this is
the best the team has ever been.

607
00:34:32,072 --> 00:34:34,074
Well, that you can believe.

608
00:34:34,115 --> 00:34:37,160
I just wanted to say thanks.

609
00:34:37,202 --> 00:34:40,121
You guys have been a big help.

610
00:34:40,163 --> 00:34:43,083
Especially you.

611
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:44,834
Thanks.

612
00:34:44,876 --> 00:34:48,505
It's nice to know that when I get tossed,
you're gonna be there to catch me.

613
00:34:48,546 --> 00:34:50,590
I mean, not that Bianca wasn't good.

614
00:34:50,632 --> 00:34:54,469
It's just, I don't know. You feel right.

615
00:34:54,511 --> 00:34:56,805
I like it too.
You're like a home-run ball.

616
00:34:56,846 --> 00:35:00,809
Fifteen-inch brown trout.
A mild cold. Double feature.

617
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:03,311
I get it. Things that you catch.
Shut up.

618
00:35:03,353 --> 00:35:04,646
I know at the beginning...

619
00:35:04,688 --> 00:35:07,607
I may have been against
you two joining the squad-

620
00:35:07,649 --> 00:35:10,151
I believe you called us
"godless douche-monsters. "

621
00:35:10,193 --> 00:35:12,153
It was "soulless beav-wranglers. "

622
00:35:12,195 --> 00:35:15,156
Well, that's better.
I totally misunderstood you.

623
00:35:15,198 --> 00:35:16,658
I'm trying to apologize here.

624
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:20,036
No need. And accepted.

625
00:35:22,872 --> 00:35:25,125
Hey.

626
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:29,879
You'd think as a cheerleader
I would be a little more graceful.

627
00:35:29,921 --> 00:35:35,510
I like you clumsy.
It's like I'm looking behind the curtain.

628
00:35:35,802 --> 00:35:38,096
Babe.

629
00:35:38,722 --> 00:35:40,932
Rick.

630
00:35:40,974 --> 00:35:43,268
Rick.

631
00:35:44,978 --> 00:35:49,024
- Who's the face-eater?
- Guys, come meet my boyfriend.

632
00:35:49,065 --> 00:35:54,612
- What is with that car?
- Maybe he won an LPGA tournament.

633
00:35:59,659 --> 00:36:01,036
I missed you.

634
00:36:01,077 --> 00:36:03,371
Me too. Definitely.

635
00:36:03,413 --> 00:36:05,415
Guys, this is my boyfriend.

636
00:36:05,457 --> 00:36:08,793
- Pre-fiancé, actually.
- These are the guys I told you about.

637
00:36:08,835 --> 00:36:13,840
- Nick and Shawn.
- What's up, guys? I'm Dr. Rick.

638
00:36:14,007 --> 00:36:16,426
Really?

639
00:36:16,634 --> 00:36:17,802
Pound?

640
00:36:17,844 --> 00:36:20,055
Aren't you a little young
to be a doctor?

641
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:22,474
- He's pre-med.
- Then why call yourself "doctor"?

642
00:36:22,515 --> 00:36:25,977
Why put off the inevitable?

643
00:36:26,019 --> 00:36:28,146
You should get
that mole checked out.

644
00:36:28,188 --> 00:36:32,609
I'd do it myself,
but I don't have my bag on me.

645
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:34,235
Your book bag?

646
00:36:34,277 --> 00:36:37,739
- How'd you two crazy kids meet, Rick?
- It's a funny story, actually.

647
00:36:37,781 --> 00:36:43,745
Our parents knew each other from
way back, and they introduced us.

648
00:36:45,497 --> 00:36:49,751
Not that funny a story. Not really
even a story. Just like a fact.

649
00:36:49,793 --> 00:36:52,128
We've been going out
since I was a sophomore.

650
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:56,257
We should hit it, Carly. I told the guys
we'd be done dinner in 45.

651
00:36:56,299 --> 00:36:59,636
- The guys are with you?
- It was a long-ass drive, babe.

652
00:36:59,678 --> 00:37:02,931
You didn't want me falling asleep
at the wheel, did you?

653
00:37:02,972 --> 00:37:04,683
No, I'm glad you made it.

654
00:37:04,724 --> 00:37:08,144
Yeah, you're glad.
I got a rezzy at Red Lobster.

655
00:37:08,186 --> 00:37:11,398
We've got a booth in the back
behind a plant...

656
00:37:11,439 --> 00:37:14,984
so no one can see how much
we're all-you-can-eating.

657
00:37:15,026 --> 00:37:18,530
If you know what I'm saying, boys.

658
00:37:18,571 --> 00:37:23,076
Okay. Oh, Shawn.
I have something for you.

659
00:37:26,621 --> 00:37:28,540
Sweet deal you kids
got going on here.

660
00:37:28,581 --> 00:37:30,750
Wish I could hang out,
play all summer.

661
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:33,837
I'm just a little busy
picking my specialty.

662
00:37:33,878 --> 00:37:36,131
Specialty? You're a freshman.

663
00:37:36,172 --> 00:37:39,092
Your specialty should be putting a cow
in the dean's office.

664
00:37:39,134 --> 00:37:43,179
/Animal House reference. Love it!/

665
00:37:44,848 --> 00:37:47,517
My mom sent mine,
so I don't need yours anymore.

666
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:50,562
- Thanks.
- Sure.

667
00:37:50,812 --> 00:37:55,608
And, chief. Next time, if my girl needs
something, she can borrow it from me.

668
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:58,528
Rick, he was just being nice.

669
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:01,239
Those feet look pretty small.
What are they, a seven?

670
00:38:01,281 --> 00:38:03,783
Ten and a half, papo.

671
00:38:03,825 --> 00:38:06,786
Eleven in Crocs.

672
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:17,464
What's the name of that girl
who was 5'7", blond hair, blue eyes?

673
00:38:17,505 --> 00:38:20,759
She's like a dragon.
Reminds me of Christmas.

674
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,554
It's Carols, Care-holes, Car-
Caroline. Caroline.

675
00:38:24,596 --> 00:38:26,765
I'm running out of ink.
You got a pen?

676
00:38:26,806 --> 00:38:28,308
Mopey, I'm talking to you here.

677
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:31,186
You been sitting out here staring
into space for two hours.

678
00:38:31,227 --> 00:38:34,105
- It's been five minutes.
- Really? That was five minutes?

679
00:38:34,147 --> 00:38:37,650
Guess I really do suck in bed.

680
00:38:37,692 --> 00:38:40,487
Get it? Like I think I'm Sting,
and in all reality...

681
00:38:40,528 --> 00:38:44,074
I'm like Chad Michael Murray
douching it out in five minutes.

682
00:38:44,115 --> 00:38:45,617
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

683
00:38:45,658 --> 00:38:47,577
- Come on, tell me.
- It's nothing.

684
00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:48,870
- Tell me.
- It's nothing.

685
00:38:48,912 --> 00:38:52,248
Tell me. Tell me, tell me, tell me...

686
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:54,334
- Nick.
- Sorry.

687
00:38:54,376 --> 00:38:56,753
- Tell me?
- Carly's boyfriend's a real schwanz.

688
00:38:56,795 --> 00:38:59,506
Dude, you like her. I knew it.
I knew you liked her.

689
00:38:59,547 --> 00:39:01,383
- So? It's no big deal.
- No big deal?

690
00:39:01,424 --> 00:39:03,802
She's on our squad.
You're gonna ruin everything.

691
00:39:03,843 --> 00:39:07,639
Why you gotta do this, huh? Why you
gotta take a leak all over my dreams?

692
00:39:07,681 --> 00:39:09,891
Why you lay a hot toddy
all over my hopes?

693
00:39:09,933 --> 00:39:12,644
- You're being a little dramatic.
- Well, I have never.

694
00:39:12,686 --> 00:39:15,230
What makes this girl so great, bro?

695
00:39:15,271 --> 00:39:18,441
Yeah. What makes this girl
so great, bro?

696
00:39:18,483 --> 00:39:20,235
There's just something about her.

697
00:39:20,276 --> 00:39:22,862
You know when she bumped into me
on the bus?

698
00:39:22,904 --> 00:39:27,909
Or when I saw her reading that book.
That she orders pudding for dessert.

699
00:39:27,951 --> 00:39:30,912
Okay, now you're just listing things
that people do.

700
00:39:30,954 --> 00:39:32,706
No, I'm not.

701
00:39:32,747 --> 00:39:36,459
- Sometimes she writes with a pencil.
- So much worse than I thought.

702
00:39:36,501 --> 00:39:37,919
You're really into this girl.

703
00:39:37,961 --> 00:39:39,421
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

704
00:39:39,462 --> 00:39:41,631
Why is she with that knob-rocket?

705
00:39:41,673 --> 00:39:44,676
Enough already. You're even
depressing me, and I'm a Virgo.

706
00:39:44,718 --> 00:39:47,345
We have got to cheer you up.

707
00:39:47,387 --> 00:39:49,597
I'm two steps ahead of you, my man.

708
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:53,476
All right, gentlemen, saddle up.

709
00:39:53,518 --> 00:39:55,770
Listen, ladies,
I couldn't help but notice...

710
00:39:55,812 --> 00:39:58,273
you were practicing your lifts
on dry ground.

711
00:39:58,314 --> 00:40:00,233
Well, where else
would we practice?

712
00:40:00,275 --> 00:40:05,280
The pond. That's where the top teams
do. Water resistance, better training.

713
00:40:05,321 --> 00:40:07,407
Why do you think octopuses
have skinny arms?

714
00:40:07,449 --> 00:40:09,159
That sounds like a good idea.

715
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,954
We can't. Our swimsuits are
all the way back at the bunks.

716
00:40:12,996 --> 00:40:16,374
We could just go in our underwear.
I mean, that's all swimsuits are.

717
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:19,336
It's gonna be dark soon anyway,
so no one would see us.

718
00:40:19,377 --> 00:40:23,256
I never thought about it like that,
but I guess you're right.

719
00:40:23,298 --> 00:40:25,967
Look at that. We're all here
thinking inside the box...

720
00:40:26,009 --> 00:40:28,386
and you're outside
playing a game of "What If?"

721
00:40:28,428 --> 00:40:32,474
Gorgeous and brilliant.
The triple threat.

722
00:40:32,515 --> 00:40:35,643
And we're off. Gentlemen, ladies.

723
00:40:35,685 --> 00:40:40,523
Adam, you've done enough
working out. Let's go.

724
00:40:42,734 --> 00:40:45,695
Oh, there it is.

725
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:49,949
I am so excited.

726
00:40:49,991 --> 00:40:54,037
I have not been skinny dipping
since Indian Scouts.

727
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,539
Nobody look.

728
00:40:56,581 --> 00:40:58,333
Windmill.

729
00:40:58,375 --> 00:41:01,419
We're leaving our underwear on.
We talked about this, remember?

730
00:41:01,461 --> 00:41:04,214
You talked. I listened.

731
00:41:04,255 --> 00:41:08,802
Paint the fence. Cutting the cake.
Hangman's noose. Hangman's noose.

732
00:41:08,843 --> 00:41:11,388
Incoming.

733
00:41:20,146 --> 00:41:25,151
Misjudged the depth.
It's all good. Learn from me.

734
00:41:59,811 --> 00:42:01,229
This feels great.

735
00:42:01,271 --> 00:42:03,565
It's the water resistance.
It helps strengthen.

736
00:42:03,606 --> 00:42:05,817
It's twice the compound,
half the measure...

737
00:42:05,859 --> 00:42:09,821
- ... and if you equivalate that to-
- Nick. Enough of that.

738
00:42:09,863 --> 00:42:12,157
- Enough of what?
- Drop the game.

739
00:42:12,198 --> 00:42:15,785
There are 300 girls at this camp
and only four straight guys.

740
00:42:15,827 --> 00:42:21,708
It's no mystery why you're ripping
through the place. So come on.

741
00:42:22,292 --> 00:42:24,753
Come on.

742
00:42:24,794 --> 00:42:27,380
Tick tock.

743
00:42:28,006 --> 00:42:30,842
Oh, all right.

744
00:42:37,182 --> 00:42:39,893
You're next.

745
00:42:40,602 --> 00:42:43,021
Ladies.

746
00:42:49,277 --> 00:42:51,821
- Where are our clothes?
- We left them right here.

747
00:42:51,863 --> 00:42:54,949
I know. That's why I'm saying,
"Where are our clothes?"

748
00:42:54,991 --> 00:42:59,079
I'm blazing a trail. I'm blazing a trail.

749
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,622
See you guys.

750
00:43:00,663 --> 00:43:02,999
- Okay, have a great Thanksgiving.
- What?

751
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:06,419
I don't know, I'm cold.

752
00:43:07,629 --> 00:43:10,048
- I'm cold and I'm flailing.
- I know, I know.

753
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:11,549
How are you not flailing?

754
00:43:11,591 --> 00:43:13,968
I'm flailing. I too am also flailing.

755
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:17,222
- So how was she?
- How was who?

756
00:43:17,263 --> 00:43:20,016
- The blond you were making time with.
- I wasn't.

757
00:43:20,058 --> 00:43:23,478
We just talked. She's really nice.
Her grandmother's from Cincinnati.

758
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,730
She helped me on
my crossover basket launches.

759
00:43:25,772 --> 00:43:27,982
I can't believe how high
my extensions are.

760
00:43:28,024 --> 00:43:30,694
I don't know who you are anymore.

761
00:43:30,735 --> 00:43:32,862
Boys.

762
00:43:32,904 --> 00:43:35,198
What are you doing?
It's way past curfew.

763
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:38,159
We were just...

764
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:41,079
Practicing.

765
00:43:41,204 --> 00:43:42,914
- Yeah.
- Al dente?

766
00:43:42,956 --> 00:43:46,543
Yeah. We like to do cheers in the nude
so that they really sink in.

767
00:43:46,584 --> 00:43:50,296
That way our bodies learn it
as well as our minds.

768
00:43:50,338 --> 00:43:53,133
That's very Alvin Ailey of you.
I like it.

769
00:43:53,174 --> 00:43:56,052
- Proceed.
- Proceed with what, running away?

770
00:43:56,094 --> 00:43:58,054
No, with the cheer, you goose.

771
00:43:58,096 --> 00:44:01,558
Don't you wanna wait for
another coach? Or a witness?

772
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:02,934
Five, six, seven, eight.

773
00:44:02,976 --> 00:44:04,310
- Ready?
- Okay.

774
00:44:04,352 --> 00:44:05,770
/Hey, Tigers!/

775
00:44:05,812 --> 00:44:07,272
/- Yeah?
- Hey, Tigers!/

776
00:44:07,313 --> 00:44:11,151
/Yeah? What do we like to eat?
Panther meat/

777
00:44:11,192 --> 00:44:12,861
/I said, hey, Tigers!/

778
00:44:12,902 --> 00:44:14,529
/- Yeah?
- Hey, Tigers!/

779
00:44:14,571 --> 00:44:18,533
/Yeah? What do we like to do?
Defeat/

780
00:44:18,575 --> 00:44:20,952
- Dude, your crankshaft.
- Two.

781
00:44:20,994 --> 00:44:23,788
/Orange, black and white unite/

782
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:26,458
/Tigers, Tigers, fight, fight, fight!/

783
00:44:26,499 --> 00:44:29,044
Tailpipe.

784
00:44:30,253 --> 00:44:32,464
Your counts are off,
your spacing is insane...

785
00:44:32,505 --> 00:44:35,342
and your moves sloppier
than a kiss from a midshipman.

786
00:44:35,383 --> 00:44:38,678
- What?
- Take it from the top. Positions.

787
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,180
Parallel positions!

788
00:44:40,221 --> 00:44:42,223
Five, six, seven, eight.

789
00:44:42,265 --> 00:44:45,560
/Go bananas
Go, go bananas/

790
00:44:45,602 --> 00:44:49,230
/Go bananas
Go, go bananas/

791
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:54,277
You can put me down now.

792
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:56,571
Oh, can I?

793
00:44:56,613 --> 00:44:58,531
You jerk.

794
00:44:58,573 --> 00:44:59,741
Jack-knocker.

795
00:44:59,783 --> 00:45:01,534
Oh, look.

796
00:45:01,576 --> 00:45:04,412
- What are they doing?
- It's the Fountain of Troy.

797
00:45:04,454 --> 00:45:08,833
I thought that move
was prohibidimabido.

798
00:45:09,334 --> 00:45:11,378
- My face!
- It's okay, it's okay.

799
00:45:11,419 --> 00:45:13,672
What'd I tell you about
that Fountain of Troy?

800
00:45:13,713 --> 00:45:15,465
Look, you broke her face.

801
00:45:15,507 --> 00:45:18,927
Where am I gonna get another one
of those this late in the day?

802
00:45:18,968 --> 00:45:20,970
Someone call a doctor!

803
00:45:21,012 --> 00:45:22,472
Damn, I wish Rick were here.

804
00:45:22,514 --> 00:45:26,893
Why, so he could ask someone
to call a doctor?

805
00:45:26,935 --> 00:45:29,145
Ever been to
a cheerleading competition?

806
00:45:29,187 --> 00:45:31,272
Oh, you mean like a football game?

807
00:45:31,314 --> 00:45:34,401
No, not a game.
Those are like practices for us.

808
00:45:34,442 --> 00:45:36,569
I'm talking about a tournament.

809
00:45:36,611 --> 00:45:40,615
ESPN cameras all around. Hundreds
of people in crowds cheering.

810
00:45:40,657 --> 00:45:44,744
Wait.
People cheering cheerleaders?

811
00:45:45,995 --> 00:45:48,248
You should be in the movies.

812
00:45:48,289 --> 00:45:52,293
You're hotter than all of these
cheerleaders rolled together.

813
00:45:52,335 --> 00:45:56,089
Cheerleaders rolled together.

814
00:45:57,424 --> 00:45:58,925
I gotta take a Louis Leakey.

815
00:45:58,967 --> 00:46:03,013
Listen, you, don't get any cuter
while I'm gone. I'm serious.

816
00:46:03,054 --> 00:46:06,433
And let me give you a little tip
from a cheerleader.

817
00:46:06,474 --> 00:46:10,353
/Be aggressive
B- E aggressive/

818
00:46:11,855 --> 00:46:15,150
Where's that Jesse Bradford boy?
I love him. No, seriously.

819
00:46:15,191 --> 00:46:18,528
Seriously. I love him.

820
00:46:20,321 --> 00:46:21,906
I gotta be honest with you, man.

821
00:46:21,948 --> 00:46:24,409
I don't think I'm into
all this hooking up anymore.

822
00:46:24,451 --> 00:46:27,245
- It feels wrong.
- Yeah, it's supposed to feel wrong.

823
00:46:27,287 --> 00:46:29,039
No, I mean, I feel guilty.

824
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:32,000
I don't know what you're saying.
Milty? Wilty?

825
00:46:32,042 --> 00:46:33,335
Something's not right.

826
00:46:33,376 --> 00:46:37,005
- Tilty?
- I've never felt this way before.

827
00:46:37,047 --> 00:46:39,591
Maquilty?

828
00:46:43,011 --> 00:46:46,014
Is that Dr. Rick?

829
00:46:48,058 --> 00:46:50,602
Awesome song.

830
00:46:50,643 --> 00:46:54,856
Dude, these local chicks are so easy.
It's like banging fish in a barrel.

831
00:46:54,898 --> 00:46:58,943
That Gina was a freak. I've got
bite marks all over my badonkadonk.

832
00:46:58,985 --> 00:47:01,696
Or was that Aubrey?
Whichever one smells like lavender.

833
00:47:01,738 --> 00:47:03,198
I got that stuff all over me.

834
00:47:03,239 --> 00:47:05,909
One of you smell my rod,
will you?

835
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:07,702
Jesus. This guy's a dick.

836
00:47:07,744 --> 00:47:10,497
I don't get why you came here.
You don't even like Carly.

837
00:47:10,538 --> 00:47:13,041
I told you, man.
Our parents are old friends...

838
00:47:13,083 --> 00:47:16,586
which means they approve of her,
they give me anything I want...

839
00:47:16,628 --> 00:47:19,839
including this sick
3- series Beemer, with nav...

840
00:47:19,881 --> 00:47:21,925
that drove your fat ass up here.

841
00:47:21,966 --> 00:47:23,843
Rock it.

842
00:47:23,885 --> 00:47:25,845
Why you gotta take a shot
at my weight?

843
00:47:25,887 --> 00:47:27,389
You know I'm working on it.

844
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:28,640
He's just using her.

845
00:47:28,682 --> 00:47:32,519
And he likes to get bit in
the badonkadonk, that sick bastard.

846
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:33,728
I gotta tell her.

847
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:37,148
- Yeah, no, buddy. Don't tell her.
- No, I have to.

848
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:38,608
No, no, you really don't.

849
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:39,901
Yeah, I kind of do.

850
00:47:39,943 --> 00:47:44,072
It's pretty obvious that you're gonna
go against everything I stand for...

851
00:47:44,114 --> 00:47:48,910
and poop where you eat, so at least
let me help you take that poop, okay?

852
00:47:48,952 --> 00:47:51,037
Trust me, bro, don't tell her.

853
00:47:51,079 --> 00:47:53,915
Why? She needs to find out
what kind of guy he really is.

854
00:47:53,957 --> 00:47:57,961
If you tell her, you'll be the guy who
told her her boyfriend is cheating.

855
00:47:58,003 --> 00:48:01,381
- Yeah?
- Bro, that's all you're ever gonna be.

856
00:48:01,423 --> 00:48:03,967
Best-case scenario,
she looks at you as a girlfriend.

857
00:48:04,009 --> 00:48:07,679
Worst-case scenario, she's pissed
at you for poking in her business.

858
00:48:07,721 --> 00:48:10,890
Either way, you're not poking
in her business.

859
00:48:10,932 --> 00:48:14,310
You marinate with that.

860
00:48:15,645 --> 00:48:18,189
- I hear you. That's good advice.
- It is good advice.

861
00:48:18,231 --> 00:48:20,233
- Thanks.
- That's what friends are for.

862
00:48:20,275 --> 00:48:21,609
- Are you good?
- I'm good.

863
00:48:21,651 --> 00:48:23,403
Carly!

864
00:48:23,445 --> 00:48:27,282
Hey, Carly. There's something
I have to tell you. Carly!

865
00:48:27,323 --> 00:48:29,367
I was wondering where you were.

866
00:48:29,409 --> 00:48:32,704
I was looking for you too.
But you go first. What's up?

867
00:48:32,746 --> 00:48:35,498
I was just wondering
about the moon.

868
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:39,753
I mean, is it still crescent
or a half-moon?

869
00:48:39,794 --> 00:48:43,089
What the French
have to say about it?

870
00:48:43,131 --> 00:48:44,299
I'm an idiot.

871
00:48:44,341 --> 00:48:48,720
No. No, it's a waxing crescent moon
tonight, and you're not an idiot.

872
00:48:48,762 --> 00:48:51,306
Unless you don't know
what "waxing" means.

873
00:48:51,348 --> 00:48:55,435
I'm a cheerleader,
I know what "waxing" means.

874
00:48:55,477 --> 00:48:57,854
- Carly horse.
- Rick.

875
00:48:57,896 --> 00:49:03,068
- That's what he calls you?
- Yeah. He means it cute.

876
00:49:03,485 --> 00:49:07,155
- What's up, high school?
- You smell like lavender.

877
00:49:07,197 --> 00:49:08,865
Yeah.

878
00:49:08,907 --> 00:49:11,659
We're learning about the effects
of lavender therapy...

879
00:49:11,701 --> 00:49:13,536
on type-two carcinoma patients.

880
00:49:13,578 --> 00:49:19,959
How's that working out? Anyone go
into remission after smelling a flower?

881
00:49:21,002 --> 00:49:24,547
All right, you caught me, man.

882
00:49:24,589 --> 00:49:29,678
- I picked you some flowers, Carly.
- That is so sweet. Where are they?

883
00:49:29,719 --> 00:49:32,722
I made a special wish on them
and threw them into the sky.

884
00:49:32,764 --> 00:49:34,015
That is so romantic.

885
00:49:34,057 --> 00:49:38,353
We should hit it, Carlito's Way. I told
the guys I'd be done with dinner in 40.

886
00:49:38,395 --> 00:49:40,021
I'll see you at practice?

887
00:49:40,063 --> 00:49:43,817
Shawn here is a great
leather-basket tosser.

888
00:49:43,858 --> 00:49:45,735
What a great trick.

889
00:49:45,777 --> 00:49:47,445
Not as good as yours.

890
00:49:47,487 --> 00:49:51,241
I'll see you tomorrow, Shawn.

891
00:50:05,714 --> 00:50:08,508
- Awesome date.
- I'll see you at the competition?

892
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:12,512
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

893
00:50:17,726 --> 00:50:19,978
Bye.

894
00:50:22,105 --> 00:50:28,194
I like you a lot, Carles Barkley.
You're one of the good ones, babe.

895
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,256
You know what reminds me
of the better times?

896
00:50:48,298 --> 00:50:52,510
Before Carly started hanging out
with those two little suck-buckets.

897
00:50:52,552 --> 00:50:54,179
Something's up with them.

898
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:56,431
Wanna stay and do some digging?

899
00:50:56,473 --> 00:50:59,851
Big-time. You know why?

900
00:51:04,689 --> 00:51:10,487
Awesome song. Chumbawamba.
It's the soundtrack to my life, man.

901
00:51:15,658 --> 00:51:18,661
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

902
00:51:18,703 --> 00:51:20,497
/Go, Tigers!/

903
00:51:20,538 --> 00:51:23,541
Cradle. One, two.

904
00:51:26,753 --> 00:51:29,172
Great job, guys.
Let's take a little water break.

905
00:51:29,214 --> 00:51:31,800
Are my hips rotating too late
before the final toss?

906
00:51:31,841 --> 00:51:35,136
I wasn't gonna say anything,
but you gotta rotate and then catch.

907
00:51:35,178 --> 00:51:37,097
Rotate, then catch.

908
00:51:37,138 --> 00:51:40,058
- We're out of water.
- We need two volunteers to refill.

909
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:42,852
- I'll go.
- Me too.

910
00:51:42,894 --> 00:51:45,689
Dude, don't go. Hey, Shawn.

911
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:46,898
God-

912
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:50,068
That was really good.
Keep it up, okay?

913
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:52,278
Hi.

914
00:51:53,321 --> 00:51:55,865
Listen, I don't know
if I've told you this yet...

915
00:51:55,907 --> 00:51:59,411
but your coaching, I mean,
it's been incredible.

916
00:51:59,452 --> 00:52:03,707
And whatever happens between us,
you've made me a better cheerleader.

917
00:52:03,748 --> 00:52:07,585
- And for that, I owe you-
- You have some food in your teeth.

918
00:52:07,627 --> 00:52:11,631
And your pecs are uneven.
Make sure you don't favor one side.

919
00:52:11,673 --> 00:52:14,009
Always coaching.

920
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:16,886
God bless you!

921
00:52:17,303 --> 00:52:19,055
Why can't I crack this?

922
00:52:19,097 --> 00:52:20,515
Damn it.

923
00:52:20,557 --> 00:52:22,017
So...

924
00:52:22,058 --> 00:52:26,146
how often did you see Dr. Rick
during the school year?

925
00:52:26,187 --> 00:52:29,774
I don't know why he keeps calling
himself that. It's kind of douchey.

926
00:52:29,816 --> 00:52:32,986
Oh, no, no, no. It's super cool.

927
00:52:33,028 --> 00:52:35,280
I can't believe he's my pre-fiancé.

928
00:52:35,321 --> 00:52:37,574
I remember when I was 7,
I decided...

929
00:52:37,615 --> 00:52:40,785
that I was not gonna get married
until I was 34.

930
00:52:40,827 --> 00:52:45,123
- That's very specific.
- Oh, I had it all thought out.

931
00:52:45,165 --> 00:52:47,667
High school, college,
a year abroad in Greece...

932
00:52:47,709 --> 00:52:50,879
and because, don't laugh,
I always loved Greek salad.

933
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:54,966
Tomatoes, cucumbers, feta.
No, that makes perfect sense.

934
00:52:55,008 --> 00:52:56,384
I know. It's silly.

935
00:52:56,426 --> 00:52:58,386
I love that you had it
all planned out.

936
00:52:58,428 --> 00:53:01,848
- You know what John Lennon said.
- Not really. I'm not in my 50s.

937
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:03,099
I could ask my dad.

938
00:53:03,141 --> 00:53:06,186
"Life is what happens when
you're busy making other plans. "

939
00:53:06,227 --> 00:53:08,521
Yeah.

940
00:53:15,904 --> 00:53:17,864
Damn, this is heavy.

941
00:53:17,906 --> 00:53:20,367
Are you okay? You look hot.
Do you want some water?

942
00:53:20,408 --> 00:53:24,162
- Yeah, sure. Thanks.
- Here.

943
00:53:25,914 --> 00:53:28,917
Did you say I looked hot?
I'm pretty sure that's what I heard.

944
00:53:28,958 --> 00:53:31,753
- I heard you screaming like a girl.
- Oh, really?

945
00:53:31,795 --> 00:53:34,130
Oh, my God. Don't move.
There's a bee on you.

946
00:53:34,172 --> 00:53:37,425
What? No. Get it off.

947
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:41,513
You little bitch!

948
00:53:42,806 --> 00:53:45,225
All right, week three of cheer camp,
here we come.

949
00:53:45,266 --> 00:53:47,394
I love the smell of pom-pom
in the morning.

950
00:53:47,435 --> 00:53:49,896
Let's do this.

951
00:53:49,938 --> 00:53:52,273
- Where you going?
- Post-breakfast practice.

952
00:53:52,315 --> 00:53:55,944
And then, you know, Carly and I are
gonna work on reverse cartwheels.

953
00:53:55,985 --> 00:53:59,781
My left foot keeps hitching when
I do my inverse swing-over. It's like:

954
00:53:59,823 --> 00:54:02,367
Take it easy.
We're done with this, all right?

955
00:54:02,409 --> 00:54:04,077
Week three. Hit it and quit it.

956
00:54:04,119 --> 00:54:06,955
Oh, no, we gotta-
We gotta stay longer.

957
00:54:06,996 --> 00:54:09,833
Dude, it's time to go.
Remember Mookie's dad's house?

958
00:54:09,874 --> 00:54:11,418
The plasmas and the Jacuzzis.

959
00:54:11,459 --> 00:54:14,671
Yeah, but I just- I think
we should stay just a touch longer.

960
00:54:14,713 --> 00:54:16,798
I'm done. All right?
I've had enough girl.

961
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:19,676
Breadsticks only keep you
at the Olive Garden for so long.

962
00:54:19,718 --> 00:54:21,219
Till, at some point, you say:

963
00:54:21,261 --> 00:54:23,680
"Why am I at Olive Garden
with these fat people?"

964
00:54:23,722 --> 00:54:25,473
- What? No...
- Let's go.

965
00:54:25,515 --> 00:54:28,435
- Let's talk about this.
- All right, let's go. Let's pack.

966
00:54:28,476 --> 00:54:30,311
Let's just dialogue for a second.

967
00:54:30,353 --> 00:54:32,897
- We don't have to go right now.
- Yeah, we do.

968
00:54:32,939 --> 00:54:35,734
The bus leaves in an hour.
Next one's not until tomorrow.

969
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:38,403
Yeah, but come on, man.
What about our squad?

970
00:54:38,445 --> 00:54:40,363
You know,
the competition's coming up.

971
00:54:40,405 --> 00:54:43,283
Dude, the squad? The competition?
Listen to yourself.

972
00:54:43,324 --> 00:54:45,702
We had a deal. Two weeks. Right?

973
00:54:45,744 --> 00:54:48,329
Kiss, kiss, bang, bang,
sayonara, cheer camp.

974
00:54:48,371 --> 00:54:50,498
/We are leaving
We, we are leaving/

975
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:51,875
/We are leaving/

976
00:54:51,916 --> 00:54:53,668
Now, come on, dude, start packing.

977
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:56,838
I need a little bit more time with Carly.
There. I said it. Okay?

978
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,674
I know you think that's lame,
but can you give me one day?

979
00:54:59,716 --> 00:55:02,302
That's not lame, bro. That's gay.

980
00:55:02,344 --> 00:55:06,014
Well, technically, pursuing a woman
you have heterosexual feelings for...

981
00:55:06,056 --> 00:55:07,640
that's not gay, Nick.

982
00:55:07,682 --> 00:55:10,935
But using a rotating inverse
swing-over to do it? Yeah, that is.

983
00:55:10,977 --> 00:55:14,898
Shawn. Don't forget we're gonna
go over our reverse cartwheels.

984
00:55:14,939 --> 00:55:17,525
- Okay, I'll be right there.
- See you there.

985
00:55:17,567 --> 00:55:19,235
All right. Right behind him.

986
00:55:19,277 --> 00:55:22,739
All right, come on, man, let's go.
You know the deal.

987
00:55:22,781 --> 00:55:26,117
And trust me,
you're gonna thank me for this.

988
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:29,120
All right, let's go, Shawnzy.
And no more moping. All right?

989
00:55:29,162 --> 00:55:31,873
Not an attractive color on you,
nor is orange and gray.

990
00:55:31,915 --> 00:55:35,460
Takes away from your eyes.

991
00:55:42,008 --> 00:55:45,679
Damn it, damn it, damn it...

992
00:55:51,351 --> 00:55:52,560
What are you doing?

993
00:55:52,602 --> 00:55:55,146
Well, probably making
the biggest mistake of my life.

994
00:55:55,188 --> 00:55:57,440
Except that year
I wore that leather wristband.

995
00:55:57,482 --> 00:56:00,985
How did I possibly think that's cool,
you know? I'm not a blacksmith.

996
00:56:01,027 --> 00:56:02,779
That was a little Nickelback-y.

997
00:56:02,821 --> 00:56:05,281
You like this girl,
you're my boy, we stay.

998
00:56:05,323 --> 00:56:07,200
Well, what about Mookie's house?

999
00:56:07,242 --> 00:56:09,869
Are you coming or not?

1000
00:56:09,911 --> 00:56:12,539
Are you sure we are staying?
We, we are staying?

1001
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:15,417
No, I'm not sure,
so don't turn a yes into a no.

1002
00:56:15,458 --> 00:56:17,627
Thank you, Nick.
Thank you so much, man.

1003
00:56:17,669 --> 00:56:19,796
I know you don't like
man-to-man touching...

1004
00:56:19,838 --> 00:56:23,508
but my arm is on your shoulder.
Here comes my arm right now.

1005
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:25,635
/- Another day
- Another holler/

1006
00:56:25,677 --> 00:56:30,056
You're wasting my precious breath.
I can't hear you.

1007
00:56:30,098 --> 00:56:32,308
/- Another day
- Another holler/

1008
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:34,436
/- Another day
- Another holler/

1009
00:56:34,477 --> 00:56:36,438
/Another day/

1010
00:56:36,479 --> 00:56:39,274
Hey, bro, got a second?

1011
00:56:39,315 --> 00:56:40,942
Wrong section of the woods.

1012
00:56:40,984 --> 00:56:43,737
You want the northeast corner
near the redwoods.

1013
00:56:43,778 --> 00:56:47,782
What? I wanna know if you know
two dudes named Nick and Shawn.

1014
00:56:47,824 --> 00:56:51,745
Yeah. They're my bunkmates. Why?

1015
00:56:51,953 --> 00:56:58,293
Five, six, seven, eight. One, two,
three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

1016
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:00,378
- Angela, no.
- Are you okay?

1017
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:03,923
Easy, Tiger. Easy, Tiger.

1018
00:57:04,716 --> 00:57:08,553
- I'm fine. I'm fine, I'm fine.
- You all right?

1019
00:57:08,595 --> 00:57:11,139
I'm okay.

1020
00:57:11,639 --> 00:57:13,933
Sorry, guys, I just suck.

1021
00:57:13,975 --> 00:57:18,146
- It's not just you. We all kind of suck.
- We're not good at all.

1022
00:57:18,188 --> 00:57:21,524
- Hey, stop. Stop talking like that.
- But it's true.

1023
00:57:21,566 --> 00:57:23,985
We're just not that good.

1024
00:57:24,027 --> 00:57:25,278
Stop.

1025
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:29,199
Enough of that.
You can go as far as you want.

1026
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:31,451
What do the Panthers have
that you don't have?

1027
00:57:31,493 --> 00:57:32,827
- Skills.
- Athleticism.

1028
00:57:32,869 --> 00:57:34,537
- Kickass cheers.
- Hair removal.

1029
00:57:34,579 --> 00:57:37,207
Big-ass titties. I'm just saying.

1030
00:57:37,248 --> 00:57:40,210
Confidence.
They're cocky assholes.

1031
00:57:40,251 --> 00:57:43,880
Like Nick, the cockiest asshole on the
football field. That's why he's good.

1032
00:57:43,922 --> 00:57:46,299
- I'm awesome.
- Because he believes in himself.

1033
00:57:46,341 --> 00:57:47,634
Also because I'm awesome.

1034
00:57:47,676 --> 00:57:50,929
He knows he's gonna be good,
so he's good. And he takes chances.

1035
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:52,806
Due to the fact that I'm awesome.

1036
00:57:52,847 --> 00:57:55,809
- Nick. Trying to make a speech here.
- I'm sorry.

1037
00:57:55,850 --> 00:57:58,728
Either bet big or go home.

1038
00:57:58,770 --> 00:58:02,232
If you don't wanna take any chances,
then you shouldn't even be here.

1039
00:58:02,273 --> 00:58:05,819
I know you wanna be here, because
you finish last every single year...

1040
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:07,612
but you keep coming back...

1041
00:58:07,654 --> 00:58:09,948
even if it means
taking endless shit...

1042
00:58:09,989 --> 00:58:12,701
from total dong-knockers
like the Panthers.

1043
00:58:12,742 --> 00:58:14,411
I wanna cut the blond one.

1044
00:58:14,452 --> 00:58:15,829
- What?
- What?

1045
00:58:15,870 --> 00:58:17,580
- What?
- What?

1046
00:58:17,622 --> 00:58:21,126
- What?
- I'm just saying.

1047
00:58:21,167 --> 00:58:23,586
Come on, guys.
Let's be cocky assholes.

1048
00:58:23,628 --> 00:58:25,171
He's right.

1049
00:58:25,213 --> 00:58:26,339
And I can say that...

1050
00:58:26,381 --> 00:58:32,637
because I am the best cheerleader
here, so you can all suck my dick.

1051
00:58:32,887 --> 00:58:34,723
I was just being a cocky asshole.

1052
00:58:34,764 --> 00:58:38,518
Oh, nice. Did you see
what she was doing there?

1053
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:41,146
That's exactly what I want
from everybody.

1054
00:58:41,187 --> 00:58:42,939
All right, let's do this.

1055
00:58:42,981 --> 00:58:46,568
And remember, you're awesome.
Let's risk it to get the biscuit.

1056
00:58:46,609 --> 00:58:50,405
All right, get cocky, bitches.

1057
00:58:51,406 --> 00:58:53,742
Let's do it. Come on, guys. Ready.

1058
00:58:53,783 --> 00:58:55,118
/Hit it!/

1059
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:57,537
/All you chumps
Think you got poise/

1060
00:58:57,579 --> 00:58:59,831
/You prance around like little toys/

1061
00:58:59,873 --> 00:59:02,250
/Do you really think
You can make some noise?/

1062
00:59:02,292 --> 00:59:04,294
Five, six, seven, eight.

1063
00:59:04,336 --> 00:59:05,795
/Tigers!/

1064
00:59:05,837 --> 00:59:08,256
- Get cocky.
- Get cocky.

1065
00:59:08,298 --> 00:59:11,426
Come on, everybody.

1066
00:59:12,844 --> 00:59:15,680
/Let's go, tigres./

1067
00:59:15,722 --> 00:59:18,433
There it is.

1068
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:21,227
All right, get cocky.

1069
00:59:21,269 --> 00:59:22,604
Here we go, here we go.

1070
00:59:22,645 --> 00:59:25,482
Keep it tight.

1071
00:59:38,453 --> 00:59:41,790
Everybody, let's work.

1072
00:59:49,005 --> 00:59:53,718
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

1073
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,011
There it is.

1074
00:59:55,053 --> 00:59:57,305
Go big, Shawnzy.

1075
00:59:57,347 --> 01:00:00,684
I'm doing it, brother.

1076
01:00:02,936 --> 01:00:06,356
Awesome. So much better.

1077
01:00:14,239 --> 01:00:16,324
/Tigers!/

1078
01:00:16,366 --> 01:00:19,786
/All right, la tigres. Come on./

1079
01:00:19,828 --> 01:00:22,706
That's my girls,
bringing some A-game.

1080
01:00:22,747 --> 01:00:24,416
You are some cocky bitches.

1081
01:00:24,457 --> 01:00:27,919
I think it's safe to say that you guys
are now officially Tigers.

1082
01:00:27,961 --> 01:00:30,005
- Right, girls?
- All right.

1083
01:00:30,046 --> 01:00:31,631
One, two, three.

1084
01:00:31,673 --> 01:00:33,508
Tigers!

1085
01:00:33,550 --> 01:00:36,428
One, two, three, frauds!

1086
01:00:36,469 --> 01:00:39,139
- Rick?
- These two have been playing you.

1087
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:41,516
They didn't come
because they like cheerleading.

1088
01:00:41,558 --> 01:00:43,893
They came here because
they like cheerleaders.

1089
01:00:43,935 --> 01:00:46,354
- Yeah, we know.
- Everyone knows.

1090
01:00:46,396 --> 01:00:48,398
Why are you here?
What's going on, Rick?

1091
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:51,443
- Bus tickets.
- Damn it.

1092
01:00:51,484 --> 01:00:54,654
Your friends were planning on leaving
before the competition...

1093
01:00:54,696 --> 01:00:57,907
without any feeling for anyone
they may have left in their wake.

1094
01:00:57,949 --> 01:00:59,534
- Animals.
- You were gonna leave?

1095
01:00:59,576 --> 01:01:03,038
Well, we were gonna, but we didn't.
That's way before you and I ever-

1096
01:01:03,079 --> 01:01:05,874
- You were gonna do this to the squad?
- I can explain.

1097
01:01:05,915 --> 01:01:09,794
I can't believe you. I mean,
I knew you were here to get girls, but...

1098
01:01:09,836 --> 01:01:12,255
- ... I thought you started to get into it.
- I did.

1099
01:01:12,297 --> 01:01:15,633
It started off being about girls,
but then it became about you.

1100
01:01:15,675 --> 01:01:18,636
- Wait, that doesn't sound right.
- That sounds exactly right.

1101
01:01:18,678 --> 01:01:20,388
Bail, brother. Bail.

1102
01:01:20,430 --> 01:01:22,182
I really like you, Carly.

1103
01:01:22,223 --> 01:01:23,725
That's close enough, dicklick.

1104
01:01:23,767 --> 01:01:27,854
This is how you show someone you
like them, Shawn? By lying to them?

1105
01:01:27,896 --> 01:01:30,857
To be fair, he lied to you
before he really cared...

1106
01:01:30,899 --> 01:01:34,527
then he tried super hard to word it
so it wouldn't be a lie after that.

1107
01:01:34,569 --> 01:01:37,072
Just so we're on the same page.

1108
01:01:37,113 --> 01:01:40,241
If these weren't tools for healing,
I would crack you in the jaw.

1109
01:01:40,283 --> 01:01:42,327
- You're a tool for healing.
- That's right.

1110
01:01:42,369 --> 01:01:44,412
You're the guy
who's fancy with his words.

1111
01:01:44,454 --> 01:01:47,207
Well, then, why don't
I just read your diary?

1112
01:01:47,248 --> 01:01:50,251
- Where did you get that?
- I've done a bad thing. I'm so sorry.

1113
01:01:50,293 --> 01:01:53,338
I'm sorry. I'm a sorry Suzy
right now. He tricked me.

1114
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:55,006
You tricked me.

1115
01:01:55,048 --> 01:01:57,217
This is how it happened.

1116
01:01:57,258 --> 01:01:58,426
Brewster!

1117
01:01:58,468 --> 01:02:01,554
He said he wanted to leave you a note,
I brought him to the bunk.

1118
01:02:01,596 --> 01:02:03,556
He must've seen
your stuff on the couch.

1119
01:02:03,598 --> 01:02:06,351
- Why was it on the couch?
- I was cleaning up your mess.

1120
01:02:06,393 --> 01:02:08,645
I told you I can't stand clutter.
I warned you.

1121
01:02:08,687 --> 01:02:13,024
- Give me the book back.
- "Cheer camp, day one.

1122
01:02:13,066 --> 01:02:16,403
The sun rises in the summer sky...

1123
01:02:16,444 --> 01:02:20,323
like Rembrandt's brush
on a dogwood branch. "

1124
01:02:20,365 --> 01:02:23,576
- Queeratron.
- Let's go. Give it to me.

1125
01:02:23,618 --> 01:02:27,372
Back up, Abercrombie & Bitch.

1126
01:02:27,956 --> 01:02:31,167
"And thereby Diora-"

1127
01:02:34,504 --> 01:02:38,633
"I lie awake thinking, will I ever say
'Diora,' as a whisper in an ear?

1128
01:02:38,675 --> 01:02:41,594
Will she ever say "I love you,"
in a moment with a tear?"

1129
01:02:41,636 --> 01:02:45,390
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

1130
01:02:46,182 --> 01:02:48,643
Carly, I'm really sorry.
I didn't mean to hurt you.

1131
01:02:48,685 --> 01:02:52,480
Just leave, okay? Just leave
like you always planned on doing.

1132
01:02:52,522 --> 01:02:55,483
Carly, please, let me explain.
Give me just one second.

1133
01:02:55,525 --> 01:02:57,485
See you later, high school.

1134
01:02:57,527 --> 01:03:00,488
I didn't write that. I bought the book.
It was in there.

1135
01:03:00,530 --> 01:03:02,657
It was beautiful.

1136
01:03:02,699 --> 01:03:05,118
Thanks.

1137
01:03:07,370 --> 01:03:09,456
Never really thought of that one.

1138
01:03:09,497 --> 01:03:13,960
Using one's true feelings
to wrangle snooch.

1139
01:03:14,002 --> 01:03:16,588
So simple.

1140
01:03:30,185 --> 01:03:33,188
So we lied and we got caught.
So what, huh?

1141
01:03:33,229 --> 01:03:35,106
We're humans. Humans lie.

1142
01:03:35,148 --> 01:03:38,693
They tell big gigantic two-week-long
lies because they're humans.

1143
01:03:38,735 --> 01:03:41,613
Stop saying "humans. " We did this.

1144
01:03:41,654 --> 01:03:43,406
Because we're humans.

1145
01:03:43,448 --> 01:03:46,826
All right, humans are
the only species that can lie.

1146
01:03:46,868 --> 01:03:49,829
Except for maybe chameleons.

1147
01:03:49,871 --> 01:03:53,541
And possums. They play dead.

1148
01:03:55,752 --> 01:03:57,045
What's that?

1149
01:03:57,087 --> 01:04:00,382
It's Downey's bracelet.
Yeah, I love that kid, huh?

1150
01:04:00,423 --> 01:04:02,884
Said it was cool, so he gave it to me.
How nice.

1151
01:04:02,926 --> 01:04:06,137
Those are his... beads, bro.

1152
01:04:06,179 --> 01:04:08,556
Downey liked you.
Like, "liked you" liked you.

1153
01:04:08,598 --> 01:04:11,393
What? That's crazy.
Downey isn't gay.

1154
01:04:11,434 --> 01:04:14,854
Nick, come on. Think about it.

1155
01:04:14,896 --> 01:04:16,773
I'm Nick. This is Shawn.

1156
01:04:16,815 --> 01:04:19,901
- What's up? I'm Downey.
- Hey. Nice to meet you.

1157
01:04:19,943 --> 01:04:23,697
Put it in there.
A little cheer camp. Crazy good times.

1158
01:04:23,738 --> 01:04:25,198
Yeah. It's gonna be fun.

1159
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:27,784
/Panther meat!
I said, hey, Tigers!/

1160
01:04:27,826 --> 01:04:31,037
/- Yeah?
- Hey, Tigers!/

1161
01:04:31,079 --> 01:04:32,372
Diora.

1162
01:04:32,414 --> 01:04:34,499
Hey, Nick.
You wanna go out on the field...

1163
01:04:34,541 --> 01:04:36,710
and maybe count shooting stars
with me?

1164
01:04:36,751 --> 01:04:40,672
You're classic, Downey. Classic.

1165
01:04:46,219 --> 01:04:49,431
Raw-hamburger fight!

1166
01:05:02,569 --> 01:05:05,030
I'm hit.

1167
01:05:05,447 --> 01:05:09,451
Medic!
This man needs some jocks-ygen.

1168
01:05:09,492 --> 01:05:11,661
Come on, we're losing him.

1169
01:05:11,703 --> 01:05:16,458
Don't you die on me. Don't die on me.
Don't you die on me.

1170
01:05:16,499 --> 01:05:19,002
/You prance around like little toys/

1171
01:05:19,044 --> 01:05:21,546
/Do you really think
You can make some noise?/

1172
01:05:21,588 --> 01:05:23,548
Five, six, seven, eight.

1173
01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:26,134
/Tigers!/

1174
01:05:30,138 --> 01:05:32,932
Welcome back to Sucktown.
Population: you.

1175
01:05:32,974 --> 01:05:37,354
Without your gigolos, looks like
you got last place sewn up, again.

1176
01:05:37,395 --> 01:05:40,732
Why don't you get your nose job
out of everybody else's business.

1177
01:05:40,774 --> 01:05:42,108
I got thrown by a horse.

1178
01:05:42,150 --> 01:05:44,903
Why? Was he spooked because
you both have the same face?

1179
01:05:44,944 --> 01:05:46,780
You're gonna die. You're gonna die.

1180
01:05:46,821 --> 01:05:48,198
Carly, don't.

1181
01:05:48,239 --> 01:05:52,327
You're placing your anger at the boys
on them. It's transference.

1182
01:05:52,369 --> 01:05:54,913
You're right.
I'm gonna punch you in the throat!

1183
01:05:54,954 --> 01:05:57,540
Let it go.

1184
01:05:59,334 --> 01:06:03,338
Look at that little hottie. Wonder
what she wants to do with her life.

1185
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:04,547
What?

1186
01:06:04,589 --> 01:06:07,342
You know how Bianca
wants to go to cooking school...

1187
01:06:07,384 --> 01:06:09,844
and Sylvia wants to be a pilot,
and...

1188
01:06:09,886 --> 01:06:11,596
Oh, my God.

1189
01:06:11,638 --> 01:06:14,766
I actually know these girls,
as, like, friends.

1190
01:06:14,808 --> 01:06:16,309
And I care.

1191
01:06:16,351 --> 01:06:18,395
I'm becoming
like a fully formed person...

1192
01:06:18,436 --> 01:06:21,398
with like sensitivity and empathy.

1193
01:06:21,439 --> 01:06:23,566
All right, I'm a person!

1194
01:06:23,608 --> 01:06:26,820
Look at the pooper on that one.
I could rest my beer on that shit.

1195
01:06:26,861 --> 01:06:29,823
And you're back. What kind of
dressing goes on a Greek salad?

1196
01:06:29,864 --> 01:06:33,118
Olive oil, top shelf.

1197
01:06:38,998 --> 01:06:42,961
Is it me, Shawnzy, or is this not nearly
as much fun as it was last year?

1198
01:06:43,003 --> 01:06:44,170
It's not you.

1199
01:06:44,212 --> 01:06:48,258
This is too high. Give me a boost.

1200
01:06:49,175 --> 01:06:50,343
Shoulder stand.

1201
01:06:50,385 --> 01:06:52,429
- Ready?
- Okay.

1202
01:06:52,470 --> 01:06:55,015
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

1203
01:06:55,056 --> 01:06:58,018
- Grab.
- Out, drop, catch, dismount.

1204
01:06:58,059 --> 01:07:00,020
Catch. Yeah, buddy.

1205
01:07:00,061 --> 01:07:02,272
Guys?

1206
01:07:02,313 --> 01:07:03,940
Don't take this the wrong way...

1207
01:07:03,982 --> 01:07:07,152
but I think there's someone
you should talk to.

1208
01:07:07,193 --> 01:07:09,988
Hello, I'm am Reginald
von Belly Button.

1209
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:12,991
I love Twinkies.

1210
01:07:23,251 --> 01:07:27,088
The competition's tomorrow.
I wonder if we could win it.

1211
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:29,049
Did you say
"I wonder if we could win"?

1212
01:07:29,090 --> 01:07:30,550
- No.
- Yes, you did.

1213
01:07:30,592 --> 01:07:32,510
- You totally did.
- Didn't.

1214
01:07:32,552 --> 01:07:34,888
You wanna go back.
You're into cheering.

1215
01:07:34,929 --> 01:07:38,767
I'm the captain of the football team.
I could give a rat's ass about cheering.

1216
01:07:38,808 --> 01:07:41,394
- You're a cheerleader.
- You're misquoting me.

1217
01:07:41,436 --> 01:07:42,604
Do you wanna go back?

1218
01:07:42,645 --> 01:07:45,857
For you. Because I can't stand
seeing my best friend in Frown Town.

1219
01:07:45,899 --> 01:07:47,233
That's how selfless I am.

1220
01:07:47,275 --> 01:07:50,153
I would sacrifice myself
to cheer you up. I'm like Gandhi.

1221
01:07:50,195 --> 01:07:52,739
- Gandhi?
- Gandhi!

1222
01:07:52,781 --> 01:07:56,951
- Mahatma K. Gandhi.
- Quake'n Bake!

1223
01:07:58,453 --> 01:08:01,956
Bus leaves in 20 minutes.

1224
01:08:02,290 --> 01:08:05,794
If we extend our high V's, we have
a chance at landing that aerial.

1225
01:08:05,835 --> 01:08:09,172
I don't know who you are anymore.

1226
01:08:09,214 --> 01:08:10,632
Kenny's asleep on the couch.

1227
01:08:10,674 --> 01:08:13,259
We're gonna get whipped cream
and paint his face.

1228
01:08:13,301 --> 01:08:15,178
- Come on.
- Be right there, dudes.

1229
01:08:15,220 --> 01:08:20,225
- Right behind you, bro.
- Oh, my horse is peeing.

1230
01:08:35,323 --> 01:08:37,617
What is that?

1231
01:08:37,659 --> 01:08:40,662
Go back to sleep.

1232
01:08:43,832 --> 01:08:45,834
Why are you in my bed?

1233
01:08:45,875 --> 01:08:48,211
I must have sleepwalked.

1234
01:08:48,253 --> 01:08:51,131
I'm here now.
Let's just make the best of it.

1235
01:08:51,172 --> 01:08:53,758
Get out of my bed, Bianca.

1236
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:57,137
- I kind of can't.
- Why?

1237
01:08:57,178 --> 01:09:00,724
I might not have pants on.

1238
01:09:01,808 --> 01:09:03,977
- What are you doing here?
- I came back.

1239
01:09:04,019 --> 01:09:07,355
- I can see that. Goodbye.
- Carly, just listen to me.

1240
01:09:07,397 --> 01:09:08,940
- Why?
- We're teammates.

1241
01:09:08,982 --> 01:09:11,484
Teammates don't join a team
under false pretenses...

1242
01:09:11,526 --> 01:09:13,653
then leave once they
get what they want.

1243
01:09:13,695 --> 01:09:16,656
I know you're pissed at me,
and you should be. I lied to you.

1244
01:09:16,698 --> 01:09:20,910
But this is about the squad. We all
worked way too hard to throw it away.

1245
01:09:20,952 --> 01:09:22,912
How are you standing in the air?

1246
01:09:22,954 --> 01:09:25,331
Just take us back already. Christ!

1247
01:09:25,373 --> 01:09:27,125
Nick. Carly...

1248
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:29,377
I like you,
but that's not why I'm here.

1249
01:09:29,419 --> 01:09:30,920
Oh, rock me, sexy Jesus.

1250
01:09:30,962 --> 01:09:32,547
- Why are you here?
- Honestly?

1251
01:09:32,589 --> 01:09:35,717
- No. Lie to me again.
- Shawnzy, make it quick, buddy.

1252
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:39,387
- Buddy.
- I like cheering.

1253
01:09:40,347 --> 01:09:41,598
Fraggle Rock.

1254
01:09:41,639 --> 01:09:43,141
I'm sorry, man.

1255
01:09:43,183 --> 01:09:44,351
My pecs are sore.

1256
01:09:44,392 --> 01:09:48,188
Oh, my God, Diora's right.
My left side is weaker.

1257
01:09:48,229 --> 01:09:50,648
- I favor one side.
- Pull me up. Pull me up.

1258
01:09:50,690 --> 01:09:53,276
Is this your plan
to get a little face time with me?

1259
01:09:53,318 --> 01:09:56,821
No. I'm dying here, seriously.

1260
01:09:56,863 --> 01:10:02,327
- Carly, come on. We need them.
- I don't wanna come in last again.

1261
01:10:02,369 --> 01:10:04,871
Fine. But I'm only doing this
for the squad.

1262
01:10:04,913 --> 01:10:07,582
You got it.

1263
01:10:08,917 --> 01:10:11,378
- Bianca?
- Yeah.

1264
01:10:11,419 --> 01:10:16,257
Any chance you could throw on
a pair of underpants?

1265
01:10:16,299 --> 01:10:20,679
It's competition day today.
Competition.

1266
01:10:26,893 --> 01:10:29,187
- Wow, this is big-time.
- Yeah, it is.

1267
01:10:29,229 --> 01:10:32,440
Well, well, well, if it isn't a couple
of wolves in cheer clothing.

1268
01:10:32,482 --> 01:10:35,735
Which part of "next time I see
your punim they'll be on the moon"...

1269
01:10:35,777 --> 01:10:38,905
- ... didn't you understand?
- Like, the whole thing?

1270
01:10:38,947 --> 01:10:41,741
I'm gonna have to go ahead
and ask you both to go ahead...

1271
01:10:41,783 --> 01:10:44,244
and leave right now to leave now.

1272
01:10:44,285 --> 01:10:46,454
It's all right.
I told them they could stay.

1273
01:10:46,496 --> 01:10:49,624
You really want these strong-jawed
philanderers on your squad?

1274
01:10:49,666 --> 01:10:51,334
Yeah.

1275
01:10:51,376 --> 01:10:54,004
It was just a little misunderstanding
we had before.

1276
01:10:54,045 --> 01:10:55,255
All right. Your choice.

1277
01:10:55,296 --> 01:10:59,551
Next time you screw up,
I'm gonna have both your asses.

1278
01:10:59,592 --> 01:11:00,760
That's frightening.

1279
01:11:00,802 --> 01:11:02,929
Let's move it along.
Giddyup and roar.

1280
01:11:02,971 --> 01:11:05,432
Let me see those claws.
Move it along.

1281
01:11:05,473 --> 01:11:10,770
Meet me on Taryn Field tonight
after the competition. Bring your diary.

1282
01:11:10,812 --> 01:11:12,939
Only if you bring the dance
in your step...

1283
01:11:12,981 --> 01:11:18,445
like a shimmering nymph
traveling the back of the wind.

1284
01:11:19,404 --> 01:11:22,532
Good afternoon, and welcome
to Channel 29's coverage...

1285
01:11:22,574 --> 01:11:28,538
of the Regional Southeastern
Illinois Cheerleading Competition.

1286
01:11:53,271 --> 01:11:57,400
Bend at the hips and reach through
your hands. Don't lock-

1287
01:11:57,442 --> 01:12:01,321
God, please give us the strength to
land our flip-flops and basket tosses.

1288
01:12:01,363 --> 01:12:03,323
Amen. Oh, and fix the economy.

1289
01:12:03,365 --> 01:12:06,117
- Red leather, yellow leather.
- Red leather, yellow leather.

1290
01:12:06,159 --> 01:12:08,787
- Unique New York.
- Unique New York.

1291
01:12:08,828 --> 01:12:12,040
- Barack, Barack, Barack Obama.
- Barack, Barack, Barack Obama.

1292
01:12:12,082 --> 01:12:17,921
Five, six, seven, eight.
Kill, Panthers, kill. Panthers, kill...

1293
01:12:21,549 --> 01:12:24,552
- Shawn.
- Carly.

1294
01:12:25,053 --> 01:12:28,014
- What you did really hurt me.
- I know, I know. I know.

1295
01:12:28,056 --> 01:12:32,936
I want you to know why. It's just
I thought you and I got really close...

1296
01:12:32,977 --> 01:12:34,312
and I trusted you.

1297
01:12:34,354 --> 01:12:37,482
I know.
I felt the same way about you.

1298
01:12:37,524 --> 01:12:41,861
I'm really sorry, Carly.
And I don't expect you to forgive me.

1299
01:12:41,903 --> 01:12:43,947
I want you to know I'm sorry.

1300
01:12:43,988 --> 01:12:47,534
There's my Carly Davidson!

1301
01:12:49,994 --> 01:12:52,539
Hi, Rick.

1302
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:57,419
- Just came by to say break a leg.
- That's theater. This is cheering.

1303
01:12:57,460 --> 01:12:59,045
You better believe it.

1304
01:12:59,087 --> 01:13:02,632
- What's up, Dick?
- It's Rick. Dr. Rick.

1305
01:13:02,674 --> 01:13:05,885
God, I keep doing that.
You just look like such a Dick to me.

1306
01:13:05,927 --> 01:13:08,013
What are you crunt-sacks
doing back here?

1307
01:13:08,054 --> 01:13:11,057
It's okay. They're just helping us
do our final routine.

1308
01:13:11,099 --> 01:13:12,517
I'll be watching you.

1309
01:13:12,559 --> 01:13:16,563
Yeah. That's exactly what an audience
member does at a performance event.

1310
01:13:16,604 --> 01:13:19,983
Just go sit down, Rick.

1311
01:13:20,191 --> 01:13:24,696
/Robert De Niro,
Meet the Parents reference. Love it./

1312
01:13:24,738 --> 01:13:26,906
- God, he seems great.
- Really nice.

1313
01:13:26,948 --> 01:13:29,617
I like him.

1314
01:13:37,625 --> 01:13:38,877
Here you go. Look alive.

1315
01:13:38,918 --> 01:13:40,879
Coming at you.
Here you go. Look alive.

1316
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:44,549
Coming at you. Here you go,
freak shows. New uniforms.

1317
01:13:44,591 --> 01:13:47,093
- Here you go. Look alive.
- We didn't order these.

1318
01:13:47,135 --> 01:13:49,429
No shit, lesbatron. My brother did.

1319
01:13:49,471 --> 01:13:51,765
We're a new squad.
We need new uniforms.

1320
01:13:51,806 --> 01:13:54,934
- Thank you, Shawn.
- Awesome. Thank you.

1321
01:13:54,976 --> 01:13:58,188
- Okay. You owe me 127.80.
- You said it was gonna be 200.

1322
01:13:58,229 --> 01:14:00,774
- I cut you a deal.
- Wow, Poppy. Thank you.

1323
01:14:00,815 --> 01:14:02,776
That's actually human of you.

1324
01:14:02,817 --> 01:14:05,111
Don't get all ABC Family
on me here, buddy.

1325
01:14:05,153 --> 01:14:06,446
You're doing me a favor.

1326
01:14:06,488 --> 01:14:10,116
I guaranteed Staples 45 seconds
of airtime, so cheat out to camera.

1327
01:14:10,158 --> 01:14:12,202
And work this into your cheer:

1328
01:14:12,243 --> 01:14:14,871
"Staples now carries 30-percent
recycled copy paper.

1329
01:14:14,913 --> 01:14:17,624
Staples, committed to the
environment, committed to you. "

1330
01:14:17,665 --> 01:14:18,792
- Hey.
- Okay.

1331
01:14:18,833 --> 01:14:21,419
If I don't have the money,
it's my shoe in your ass.

1332
01:14:21,461 --> 01:14:26,633
- That seems fair.
- You look great. Are you in love?

1333
01:14:27,425 --> 01:14:30,011
Stay safe.

1334
01:14:31,429 --> 01:14:32,597
What's up, kid?

1335
01:14:32,639 --> 01:14:34,224
- Downey.
- Good to have you back.

1336
01:14:34,265 --> 01:14:38,103
Why didn't you tell me you're gay?
I'd have been totally okay with that.

1337
01:14:38,144 --> 01:14:44,025
- Paint with all the colors of the wind.
- Wait. You're straight?

1338
01:14:44,401 --> 01:14:46,986
Am I straight? Yes.

1339
01:14:47,028 --> 01:14:48,488
But what about your diary?

1340
01:14:48,530 --> 01:14:51,491
Then you asked for my beads
and stuck them in your mouth-

1341
01:14:51,533 --> 01:14:54,327
- I thought it was a bracelet.
- A bracelet in your mouth?

1342
01:14:54,369 --> 01:14:55,995
- I don't know.
- The closet door...

1343
01:14:56,037 --> 01:14:58,081
is made of all kinds of wood,
brother.

1344
01:14:58,123 --> 01:15:00,417
What?

1345
01:15:01,710 --> 01:15:04,254
- All kinds.
- Okay.

1346
01:15:04,295 --> 01:15:07,716
God, that is so awkward.

1347
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:16,433
The Panthers, clear favorites,
have really come to play today.

1348
01:15:43,001 --> 01:15:46,671
/Fierce, brave, hungry, Panthers/

1349
01:15:46,713 --> 01:15:49,132
/Kill!/

1350
01:15:58,350 --> 01:16:01,061
- Dude, they're kind of great.
- Yeah.

1351
01:16:01,102 --> 01:16:02,812
It's not about them, guys.

1352
01:16:02,854 --> 01:16:06,316
It's about us. Just stay focused.
We'll be fine.

1353
01:16:06,358 --> 01:16:09,152
Panthers out.

1354
01:16:15,950 --> 01:16:19,621
Oh, let me get that for you.

1355
01:16:22,248 --> 01:16:24,542
Drool much?

1356
01:16:24,584 --> 01:16:27,379
Panthers out.

1357
01:16:37,972 --> 01:16:42,185
Free paper, courtesy of Staples.
30-percent recycled copy paper.

1358
01:16:42,227 --> 01:16:45,105
Staples, committed to the
environment, committed to you.

1359
01:16:45,146 --> 01:16:47,107
Do you have
50-percent recycled paper?

1360
01:16:47,148 --> 01:16:51,111
No. But I have 50-percent recycled
asshole paper. It's in the men's room.

1361
01:16:51,152 --> 01:16:53,613
It's free, gay bar, just take it.

1362
01:16:53,655 --> 01:16:55,240
Let's do this.

1363
01:16:55,281 --> 01:16:56,366
- Tigers!
- Let's go. Let's go.

1364
01:16:56,408 --> 01:16:57,617
- Tigers!
- Let's go. Let's go.

1365
01:16:57,659 --> 01:17:01,788
Now, the Tigers from Gerald R. Ford
High School in Hinsdale, Illinois.

1366
01:17:01,830 --> 01:17:04,958
This team historically ranks last
like their namesake president.

1367
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,460
Let's see if they've
stepped it up this year.

1368
01:17:07,502 --> 01:17:10,422
Hey. Is this on TV?
Dude, this can't be on TV.

1369
01:17:10,463 --> 01:17:13,925
Don't worry. It's NBC. No one
watches network television anymore.

1370
01:17:13,967 --> 01:17:16,636
Look, it's Nick on TV, cheerleading.

1371
01:17:16,678 --> 01:17:18,972
Shawn too. They're cheerleaders.

1372
01:17:19,014 --> 01:17:22,434
I thought those dudes
were in the kitchen.

1373
01:17:22,475 --> 01:17:26,062
/All you chumps think you got poise
You prance around like little toys/

1374
01:17:26,104 --> 01:17:28,064
Shit.

1375
01:17:28,106 --> 01:17:29,482
My chickens.

1376
01:17:29,524 --> 01:17:31,484
Five, six, seven, eight.

1377
01:17:31,526 --> 01:17:34,070
/Tigers!/

1378
01:17:54,758 --> 01:17:58,136
Risky floor stunts, athletic tumbling,
tight formations.

1379
01:17:58,178 --> 01:18:04,184
Looks like the addition of those
two new guys is really paying off.

1380
01:18:05,435 --> 01:18:08,813
Oh, my God, that bitch.

1381
01:18:08,855 --> 01:18:12,192
- It's not totally her fault.
- I was talking about Dr. Dick.

1382
01:18:12,233 --> 01:18:14,819
It sucks. Don't let it distract you.
We're gonna win.

1383
01:18:14,861 --> 01:18:17,322
No, we're not.
We're not as good as the others.

1384
01:18:17,364 --> 01:18:22,369
Yeah, we are. And there's
one way we can prove it.

1385
01:18:23,870 --> 01:18:25,872
- The Fountain of Troy.
- Yeah, right.

1386
01:18:25,914 --> 01:18:30,669
I thought that move
was prohibidimibidibabido.

1387
01:18:38,093 --> 01:18:39,219
Remember Lennon?

1388
01:18:39,260 --> 01:18:41,930
"Life's what happens when
you're busy making other plans. "

1389
01:18:41,971 --> 01:18:45,016
- This is it. Life's happening.
- It's not that easy, Shawn.

1390
01:18:45,058 --> 01:18:49,187
I never said it was. You can do it.
I know you can. I'll jump it with you.

1391
01:18:49,229 --> 01:18:51,731
I still just don't see them
qualifying for States.

1392
01:18:51,773 --> 01:18:56,444
They are just not in the same league
as the top teams here.

1393
01:18:56,486 --> 01:18:58,405
- Who's gonna catch me?
- Nick.

1394
01:18:58,446 --> 01:19:01,991
- Who's gonna catch you?
- Them.

1395
01:19:02,033 --> 01:19:04,703
I have total faith in them.
They're Tigers.

1396
01:19:04,744 --> 01:19:07,163
- But what if they don't?
- Bet big or go home.

1397
01:19:07,205 --> 01:19:11,418
You gotta risk it to get the biscuit.

1398
01:19:16,256 --> 01:19:17,757
- We're doing it.
- You sure?

1399
01:19:17,799 --> 01:19:19,384
We're doing a lot of talking.

1400
01:19:19,426 --> 01:19:24,556
This seems like a lot
of talking during the routine.

1401
01:19:24,764 --> 01:19:27,600
Lot of talking during the routine.

1402
01:19:27,642 --> 01:19:29,978
I'm the fountain.
Shawn, base. Nick, back.

1403
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:32,689
Girls, catch. Shawn,
double-back handspring to end it.

1404
01:19:32,731 --> 01:19:33,940
- Got it.
- Ready?

1405
01:19:33,982 --> 01:19:36,359
Break.

1406
01:19:43,950 --> 01:19:48,246
Is this what I think it is? Are the Tigers
trying the Fountain of Troy?

1407
01:19:48,288 --> 01:19:52,167
This is the most dangerous move
in cheerleading. OMG.

1408
01:19:52,208 --> 01:19:54,336
That's prohibidado.

1409
01:19:54,377 --> 01:19:58,256
I told them in Spanish. How much
clearer could I have been?

1410
01:19:58,298 --> 01:20:00,675
Here comes the build.

1411
01:20:00,717 --> 01:20:03,011
Nice.

1412
01:20:04,179 --> 01:20:07,557
An awesome flying pose.

1413
01:20:12,145 --> 01:20:16,191
Here it comes, the final fountain.

1414
01:20:19,569 --> 01:20:21,780
And now for the final dismount.

1415
01:20:21,821 --> 01:20:24,074
Yes.

1416
01:20:24,324 --> 01:20:26,493
Perfect.

1417
01:20:26,534 --> 01:20:28,161
And the final flip out.

1418
01:20:28,203 --> 01:20:30,163
Here it comes, and...

1419
01:20:30,205 --> 01:20:32,749
/Tigers!/

1420
01:20:43,385 --> 01:20:45,762
Shawn!

1421
01:20:54,562 --> 01:20:56,981
Tigers!

1422
01:21:02,153 --> 01:21:03,863
That little shit.

1423
01:21:03,905 --> 01:21:06,866
My chicken shit.

1424
01:21:07,575 --> 01:21:12,330
Shawnzy. No, come here.
Come here, buddy. God.

1425
01:21:15,041 --> 01:21:17,293
Hey.

1426
01:21:17,502 --> 01:21:19,754
Hey.

1427
01:21:19,796 --> 01:21:21,798
Did we win?
Are we going to States?

1428
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:24,926
No, we came in 19th.

1429
01:21:24,968 --> 01:21:26,136
I'm sorry.

1430
01:21:26,177 --> 01:21:29,305
Are you kidding? That's 10 places
better than we did last year.

1431
01:21:29,347 --> 01:21:32,058
If they didn't deduct points
for the Fountain of Troy...

1432
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:34,060
we might've made top three.

1433
01:21:34,102 --> 01:21:36,146
You nailed your triple backflip.

1434
01:21:36,187 --> 01:21:38,023
I nailed my double backflip...

1435
01:21:38,064 --> 01:21:42,569
because a triple backflip
would've landed me in the water.

1436
01:21:42,610 --> 01:21:47,240
Yeah, I did do three.
That makes more sense.

1437
01:21:59,085 --> 01:22:03,798
- What was that?
- About three weeks overdue.

1438
01:22:13,350 --> 01:22:16,895
What the hell are you doing?

1439
01:22:16,936 --> 01:22:18,438
Kissing my teammate.

1440
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:22,817
You wanna die today? I can take life
just as fast as I can give it.

1441
01:22:22,859 --> 01:22:25,236
First of all, you're not a doctor.

1442
01:22:25,278 --> 01:22:27,280
Second of all,
you're not my boyfriend.

1443
01:22:27,322 --> 01:22:30,075
What? Carly Fries, come on.

1444
01:22:30,116 --> 01:22:32,994
You're dumping me for him?

1445
01:22:33,036 --> 01:22:34,537
No, I'm dumping you, period.

1446
01:22:34,579 --> 01:22:40,418
And then I'm gonna be with him,
period. If that's okay with him.

1447
01:22:41,044 --> 01:22:42,379
Question mark.

1448
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:45,423
Totally. Exclamation point.

1449
01:22:45,465 --> 01:22:49,761
Oh, puke.
Parentheses, bold, underline.

1450
01:22:49,803 --> 01:22:54,974
Carly Horse. Carly's Jr., baby.
Larry, Moe and Carly.

1451
01:22:55,684 --> 01:22:59,979
Carly and the Chocolate Factory,
sugar.

1452
01:23:00,021 --> 01:23:03,316
Carlsbad, Carly-fornia.

1453
01:23:03,358 --> 01:23:05,402
Why don't you run along now?

1454
01:23:05,443 --> 01:23:07,612
The longer you watch,
the sadder it gets.

1455
01:23:07,654 --> 01:23:09,823
- I'll show you sad.
- Hey, buddy.

1456
01:23:09,864 --> 01:23:11,199
Oh, Jesus.

1457
01:23:11,241 --> 01:23:14,160
- Nick.
- Nick.

1458
01:23:15,245 --> 01:23:16,705
That was for the Crocs.

1459
01:23:16,746 --> 01:23:19,499
You're not an old lady gardening
or a baby on the beach.

1460
01:23:19,541 --> 01:23:25,005
Okay? Now put on some shoes,
you're embarrassing yourself.

1461
01:23:25,505 --> 01:23:27,340
I'm just saying.

1462
01:23:27,382 --> 01:23:30,510
- You okay?
- Nothing a kiss can't fix.

1463
01:23:30,552 --> 01:23:33,638
Wait till tonight.

1464
01:23:34,055 --> 01:23:39,602
I'm gonna make a wish on these
and throw them into the sky.

1465
01:23:40,061 --> 01:23:42,856
I hope one of you ends up
in my ER one day, bleeding...

1466
01:23:42,897 --> 01:23:45,483
I'll make you wait for days.

1467
01:23:45,525 --> 01:23:48,862
Unless one of you has Blue Cross...

1468
01:23:48,903 --> 01:23:53,491
that's a PPO,
none of that HMO bullshit!

1469
01:23:56,411 --> 01:23:58,163
This is so cute.

1470
01:23:58,204 --> 01:24:03,084
The 19th-placers.
You're like the littlest pigs.

1471
01:24:04,377 --> 01:24:09,507
- How does it feel to still suck ass?
- You tell me.

1472
01:24:11,259 --> 01:24:15,138
Please don't hurt us. I was just kidding
about the whole rivalry thing.

1473
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:18,350
Cheering doesn't mean that much
to me. I wanna be a paralegal.

1474
01:24:18,391 --> 01:24:20,477
I love your hair. Go.
That bitch is crazy.

1475
01:24:20,518 --> 01:24:24,230
Way to go, Bianca.
I didn't know you had it in you.

1476
01:24:24,272 --> 01:24:27,317
There's a lot you don't know
about her.

1477
01:24:27,359 --> 01:24:30,653
You know that John Lennon
"life happening"...

1478
01:24:30,695 --> 01:24:34,324
"risk it to get the biscuit"
stuff you said back there?

1479
01:24:34,366 --> 01:24:35,825
It didn't really make sense.

1480
01:24:35,867 --> 01:24:37,702
Well, it got you to do it.

1481
01:24:37,744 --> 01:24:41,164
No. You got me to do it.

1482
01:24:48,380 --> 01:24:52,258
Well, congratulations, kid.
You got what you wanted.

1483
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:54,928
Thanks to you.
I couldn't have done it without you.

1484
01:24:54,969 --> 01:24:57,889
- Just shut up. Shut up.
- Is it hard for you to accept thanks?

1485
01:24:57,931 --> 01:25:00,433
- You want me to accept thanks?
- Yeah. Open up to me.

1486
01:25:00,475 --> 01:25:05,105
Here it comes from my mouth.
And you're welcome.

1487
01:25:05,146 --> 01:25:06,606
Diora.

1488
01:25:06,648 --> 01:25:09,651
Lose the clothes.

1489
01:25:12,153 --> 01:25:15,115
That's good. No.

1490
01:25:15,657 --> 01:25:17,659
- Read me something from your diary.
- What?

1491
01:25:17,701 --> 01:25:22,288
"Perchance to dream,
perchance to love a wind- Hair...

1492
01:25:22,330 --> 01:25:27,460
- the summer skies
as teardrops cascade from my lo-"

1493
01:25:29,254 --> 01:25:32,507
Oh, my God. My husband.

1494
01:25:32,549 --> 01:25:34,134
This is not what it looks like.

1495
01:25:34,175 --> 01:25:36,302
Looks like you're running
some naked drill.

1496
01:25:36,344 --> 01:25:37,470
Exactly.

1497
01:25:37,512 --> 01:25:39,973
- Carry on.
- With what? Kissing your wife?

1498
01:25:40,015 --> 01:25:42,559
Good one. Five, six, seven, eight.

1499
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:45,603
/I said, hey, Tigers! Yeah?
I said, hey, Tigers! Yeah?/

1500
01:25:45,645 --> 01:25:48,106
Hold it.

1501
01:25:49,524 --> 01:25:54,154
I'm gonna lay my hands on you to get
a really good sense of your movement.

1502
01:25:54,195 --> 01:25:55,905
Five, six, seven, eight.

1503
01:25:55,947 --> 01:25:57,907
/- I said, hey, Tigers!
- Yeah!/

1504
01:25:57,949 --> 01:26:00,118
/- I said, hey, Tigers!
- Yeah!/

1505
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:02,829
/- What do we like to-?
- Panther meat!/

1506
01:26:02,871 --> 01:26:06,166
Sweet Jesus, mother of God!

1507
01:26:06,207 --> 01:26:09,669
I don't wanna run laps all afternoon.
I have a shrink appointment.

1508
01:26:09,711 --> 01:26:12,797
Dude, your cousin stuck his finger
in your ass. Get over it.

1509
01:26:12,839 --> 01:26:14,924
Dude, your dad put his wang
on your shoulder.

1510
01:26:14,966 --> 01:26:17,427
Dude, your mom gave you an HJ
and tipped you a dollar.

1511
01:26:17,469 --> 01:26:19,763
Your cousin whacked you
in the face with his wang.

1512
01:26:19,804 --> 01:26:23,350
Come on, your cousin put his wiener
on your plate. You gotta get over it.

1513
01:26:23,391 --> 01:26:25,769
Will you shut up, man?
I'm too straight to be gay.

1514
01:26:25,810 --> 01:26:30,023
/I could watch What Not to Wear
with Nathan Lane in my blouse.../

1515
01:26:30,065 --> 01:26:32,192
and still win a straight award.

1516
01:26:32,233 --> 01:26:33,443
That's not right.

1517
01:26:33,485 --> 01:26:35,528
I could smoke pole
and still be straight.

1518
01:26:35,570 --> 01:26:39,532
- I can't say "smoke pole"?
- No.

1519
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:41,368
Carly. Come here.

1520
01:26:41,409 --> 01:26:44,245
We're working on a new mount
Bianca came up with.

1521
01:26:44,287 --> 01:26:47,165
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

1522
01:26:47,207 --> 01:26:49,542
- We didn't order these.
- No shit, lesbatron.

1523
01:26:49,584 --> 01:26:52,587
No shit, Indigo Girl.
No shit, Lesbos, island of Greece.

1524
01:26:52,629 --> 01:26:55,298
No shit, queer-leader.
No shit, Dixie Chick.

1525
01:26:55,340 --> 01:26:58,009
Wait, what? Just joking. Sorry.

1526
01:26:58,051 --> 01:27:00,053
The Fountain of Troy?

1527
01:27:00,095 --> 01:27:04,265
I thought that move
was prohibidabido.

1528
01:27:04,307 --> 01:27:06,059
It's not prohibidabido?

1529
01:27:06,101 --> 01:27:10,105
No, I'm pretty sure
it's prohibibabido.

1530
01:27:10,146 --> 01:27:11,314
Cut.

1531
01:27:11,356 --> 01:27:14,275
Go ahead and clap.

1532
01:27:14,317 --> 01:27:16,569
Mediocrity deserves applause.

1533
01:27:16,611 --> 01:27:21,783
Why don't we go find a Ford Focus
and clap around it?

1534
01:27:23,702 --> 01:27:26,413
Mascot down!

1535
01:27:27,038 --> 01:27:29,874
It's a dragon!

1536
01:27:31,126 --> 01:27:34,546
Tell me about that road.

1537
01:27:36,339 --> 01:27:39,884
Is it lonely on that road?

1538
01:27:44,014 --> 01:27:47,559
Have you made up your mind?

1539
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:51,896
- You gonna waste any more time?
- No!

1540
01:27:53,231 --> 01:27:56,192
Then here we go.

1541
01:28:08,663 --> 01:28:11,458
- F-U!
- F-U!

1542
01:28:18,173 --> 01:28:21,718
You're damn straight. F-U!

1543
01:29:55,812 --> 01:30:00,900
I can't take this head anymore.
Oh, the air feels so good.

1544
01:30:00,942 --> 01:30:03,611
All right, kiss me.

1545
01:30:03,653 --> 01:30:05,905
What are you doing?

1546
01:30:05,947 --> 01:30:09,325
Keep it on, sexy beast.

1547
01:30:22,714 --> 01:30:26,343
And that's how you kiss a guy.

1548
01:30:26,384 --> 01:30:27,510
Okay.

1549
01:30:27,552 --> 01:30:30,555
All right, again.
