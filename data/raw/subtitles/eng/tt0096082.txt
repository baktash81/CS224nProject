1
00:00:00,542 --> 00:00:03,212
(brooding music)

2
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:45,230
(birds cawing)

3
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,636
(car starts)

4
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,024
- You're late.

5
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:31,401
- According to my schedule,
my timing's perfect.

6
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:32,778
- Elsewhere, perhaps,

7
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,780
but if you want to get along around here,

8
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:36,907
you'd best buy yourself a new wristwatch.

9
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,993
- Are you in charge around here?

10
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,164
- Why not?

11
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:45,916
(gate creaks)

12
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:49,211
Oh, I forgot my manners. Please, come in.

13
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,463
Welcome to our home.

14
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,349
Meet the porter.

15
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,024
- Right this way?

16
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:12,818
- Uh-huh.

17
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,655
(bell tolls)

18
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,074
- Stephanie.

19
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:32,629
- This is the right place?

20
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,047
- Oh, yes.

21
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,675
- Sister Holloway.
- Please, call me Helen.

22
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:39,553
Ah, no, sorry. No touching allowed here.

23
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:41,638
One of Dr. Hildesheimer's rules.

24
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:42,889
- Oh.

25
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:43,807
Tell me more.

26
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,811
- Well, that and what you'll
learn about his new methods.

27
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:50,605
No alcohol, and punctuality.

28
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:51,565
- Hmm.
- Come.

29
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,573
I'm sure you'll be
comfortable enough here.

30
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:02,200
- Sure, being led around
by big guys in white coats

31
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:03,785
and locked up nights.
- Not at all.

32
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,371
You're perfectly free to
come and go as you please.

33
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,290
Dr. Hildesheimer wants
to see you in his rooms

34
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,292
in 15 minutes, sharp.

35
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,837
Yours is down there on the right.

36
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:14,755
- Thank you.

37
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:24,848
(machinery whirring)

38
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,109
Oh, right there is fine.

39
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:12,062
- This could be a most
interesting case, Dieter.

40
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:14,773
Oh, and don't forget to discuss

41
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,316
the statement from her father.

42
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:17,484
It could reveal a lot.

43
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:22,823
Dieter, you're not going to use

44
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,574
the drug therapy on her, are you?

45
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:26,368
Good.

46
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,786
(knock at door)

47
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:28,703
Come in.

48
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,457
Ah, Stephanie.

49
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,085
Come.

50
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,925
I'd like you to meet Dr.
Hildesheimer. Doctor?

51
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:48,348
Well, let me leave you two
to get to know each other.

52
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,226
I'll call your father and
tell him you arrived safely.

53
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:52,227
- Thank you, Helen.

54
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,449
(gate creaks)

55
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,704
You don't talk much, do you?

56
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:12,664
- You're here to do the talking, hmm?

57
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:17,711
- Well, I'm not sure about the place,

58
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:19,254
but I'm impressed with your methods.

59
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:20,714
I've heard a lot about them.

60
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:22,883
But, um, what can I tell you

61
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,552
that you might not already know about?

62
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:26,970
- Simply tell me about you.

63
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,436
- Stephanie will be fine here, I'm sure.

64
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:35,687
Thanks. Goodbye.

65
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,481
Oh, Brenda.

66
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,276
I really don't like having
to say this to you again,

67
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,028
but since Kurt first brought you here,

68
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,822
I've not been happy with
the quality of your work.

69
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,283
- Sister, please. Try to understand.

70
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,701
Things have been a little difficult

71
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,119
between me and Kurt lately, and-

72
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,039
- That's private. It shouldn't
interfere with your work.

73
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:55,373
You don't stick to your schedule,

74
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:56,917
you disregard the doctor's instructions-

75
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,044
- I put everything I have into my work.

76
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:00,337
I've really been trying.

77
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,298
- Oh? Well, perhaps you could
try just a little harder.

78
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,593
Come tomorrow, I expect to
see a visible improvement.

79
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:09,137
- It's just sometimes you get
yourself into a situation-

80
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,889
- That'll be all. Thank you, Nurse.

81
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:11,806
- Yes.

82
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,813
- So really, I'm here
because of my father.

83
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,653
I'm a big girl with, shall we
say, not so small a problem.

84
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,572
(intercom buzzes)

85
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,328
- (sighs) Excuse me.

86
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:56,518
Helen, what is it? What's so important?

87
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,104
- It looks as though we'll finally get it.

88
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:01,815
- What?
- The grant! Gantry says...

89
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:02,941
Here, listen.

90
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,903
"I'm most interested in
the work you are doing.

91
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,571
I appreciate your vision.

92
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,657
I will visit you on Thursday the 12th.

93
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:14,202
I'm confident that, given
your fascinating presentation,

94
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:18,289
I will be able to recommend
that the sum of $1 million

95
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:21,251
be granted for the improvement
of your existing facilities

96
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,962
as well as additional
funds for actual research.”

97
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:26,464
(airy music)

98
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,869
- You can go back to your room now.

99
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:16,765
- You can help me, Doctor, can't you?

100
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,479
- Yes. I think so.

101
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,779
- I'm sorry about that.

102
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,284
Yeah, well, uh...

103
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,502
(sinister music)

104
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,808
(low hum throbbing)

105
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:19,387
- [Stephanie on Tape] I'm
not sure about the place,

106
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,805
but I'm impressed with your methods.

107
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:24,142
I've heard a lot about them. But, um...

108
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:36,237
- [Patient] Battalion!

109
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,155
Ready!

110
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,453
- [Kurt] Hello, General.

111
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,569
- Time for bread! Up, young man!

112
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:19,030
Report for duties, 0700 hours!

113
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:27,080
(door slams)

114
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,958
(Stephanie sighs)

115
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,881
(knock at door)

116
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,800
- Yes?

117
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,558
- Sorry about that.

118
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,811
It's his thing. Does it every morning.

119
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:57,568
My name's Alice. Breakfast
in the dining room till nine.

120
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,488
- I'll be up later.

121
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:13,251
(pensive music)

122
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,064
- Kurt, would you begin?

123
00:14:58,356 --> 00:14:58,981
- Sure.

124
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:03,277
Hi, I'm Kurt. Everybody knows that.

125
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:05,530
Stephanie, we have met.

126
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:11,452
Helen and I figured that
today might be a good time

127
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,287
to talk about our past lives.

128
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:16,833
You see, I too was a patient here.

129
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,336
Not so long ago,

130
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:24,882
I cruised the streets, a lot.

131
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:27,427
I picked up women,

132
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,012
took them home,

133
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,474
and killed the whores,

134
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,310
just like I did my mother at birth.

135
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:44,235
Though these crimes were only in my mind,

136
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:47,196
I lived like a criminal,

137
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:49,740
till I came here.

138
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:55,204
- Matthew? Would you talk to us now?

139
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:57,165
Please come forward.

140
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:04,964
Matthew?

141
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,233
- I'm Paul.

142
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,986
I suffer from a stunted libido.

143
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,657
My sexual growth took a
dive during my childhood

144
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,743
and developed into a neurotic condition

145
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:36,454
with psychotic undercurrents.

146
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,956
It got me sent to prison.

147
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,919
I met the doctor and
he started treating me.

148
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,380
I feel I'm making progress,

149
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,466
getting better, coming
to terms with things,

150
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:51,802
and straightening out the kinks.

151
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,600
As a new patient,

152
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,936
I'd like you to know
that I value my privacy,

153
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:02,855
and I expect you to respect that.

154
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,132
- My name is Stephanie.

155
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:35,429
I've never been to a place like
this before, so forgive me.

156
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,975
Dad sent me here.

157
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,354
He never loved me. He
never loved my mother.

158
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:47,692
It was embarrassing. For him.

159
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:54,865
I have a breast cathexis. Non-contagious.

160
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:57,868
You see, I, uh...

161
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,745
I like to show people what I've got.

162
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:04,500
I do it on impulse. It's unpremeditated.

163
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:09,213
So, uh...

164
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:11,048
Beware.

165
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:20,474
- Matthew?

166
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,144
Would you try now, please?

167
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:32,737
- This is bullshit.

168
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:35,156
- Charming, Paul. Sit.

169
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,076
- It's all right, Helen. You can go, Paul.

170
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,077
- [Paul] Yes, sir.

171
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:55,468
- Because...

172
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:59,347
Because of what I had become,

173
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,100
I was a burden to my parents

174
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:06,979
and an object of ridicule
amongst the boys at school.

175
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,275
Because of what I had become,

176
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,237
I turned to spiritual love.

177
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,825
But lovers need more.
They need physical love.

178
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:26,916
Because of what I am, I'm alone.

179
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:29,919
And because I'm alone,

180
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:32,296
I've turned to nature and the universe,

181
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,508
because they accept my love and accept me.

182
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,469
Without conditions.

183
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:48,896
- I'm Julia.

184
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,525
Do you really care about my feelings?

185
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,321
No.

186
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,073
You don't.

187
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,123
I've realized one thing:

188
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:12,128
you can give something
to somebody, everything,

189
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,715
but it's just not enough.

190
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:38,904
- So.

191
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:41,782
You accepted my invitation.

192
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,964
- If I didn't know any better, I'd, uh...

193
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,092
I'd think I was being seduced.

194
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,596
- Why have you come here, really? Huh?

195
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:06,557
(Stephanie chuckles)

196
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:07,808
I know what you are.

197
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:23,157
(thud echoes)

198
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:29,246
- There's gonna be an apocalypse.

199
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:33,334
- I know.

200
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:34,835
- Scared?

201
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:35,753
- No.

202
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,095
- I didn't like being pushed.

203
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,144
What's with you and the boy?

204
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,731
Matthew?

205
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,989
- I don't like what you're implying.

206
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:11,872
Don't.

207
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:15,543
- What a waste.

208
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:21,173
Nothing more to say.

209
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:44,154
- I mean, I can't
understand why she's here.

210
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:47,950
Apart from what she told us,
she seemed pretty normal.

211
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:49,451
- You interested?

212
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,328
- Hey, Steph. Oh.

213
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,748
Brenda? Stephanie, our new patient.

214
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,127
Brenda's on the staff here. Um...

215
00:22:58,419 --> 00:22:59,879
We kinda go together.

216
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,172
- Hi, Stephanie. Nice to meet you.

217
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:03,883
I hope you'll be happy here.

218
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:06,594
- Brenda.

219
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:11,348
(ominous music)

220
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,559
- Here.

221
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:14,476
Read this.

222
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:24,653
- So?

223
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:27,573
You know, I've been
hanging in for two years

224
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:29,033
with waiting for that.

225
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:31,243
Now it's finally come, I feel nothing.

226
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,747
Guess I gotta think about leaving.

227
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,835
- Before, in the group
therapy, you were...

228
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:43,964
Listen, are you sure you still
want to go through with this?

229
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,424
- What are you saying?

230
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:47,843
- We agreed on something, didn't we?

231
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:50,638
- Hey, look, if it's a girl
you're worried about, forget it.

232
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,057
I made a deal with you
and I'm sticking to it.

233
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:57,895
It's just I'm interested
again, that's all.

234
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:01,148
It's new for me. I may be getting better.

235
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:07,154
Anyway, I need the money,
and that's the bottom line.

236
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:10,449
I guess I got things to do.

237
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:16,205
(Stephanie panting softly)

238
00:24:41,105 --> 00:24:44,108
(Stephanie grunting)

239
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:51,782
(Stephanie shivering)

240
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:58,747
(Stephanie groans)

241
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:04,878
(Stephanie moans)

242
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:21,645
(typewriter clacking)

243
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:32,948
(both panting)
(ominous music)

244
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,562
(Brenda moans)

245
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,152
(both sigh)

246
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:19,870
- [Brenda] Kurt.

247
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:25,876
(eerie music)

248
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,611
(ominous music)

249
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:58,742
(door creaks)

250
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:37,656
(Brenda moaning softly)

251
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:46,790
(Brenda screaming)

252
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,609
(Brenda moans)

253
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:21,533
- I brought you here.

254
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:24,703
(eerie music)

255
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:25,871
Really tried.

256
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:34,087
I know you loved me.

257
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,800
Was that your mistake?

258
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,725
I couldn't tell you.

259
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:48,977
I didn't realize.

260
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,151
Then she came.

261
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,365
Brought it with her.

262
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,705
It was in those goddamn bags.

263
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:11,166
Don't you...

264
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:21,009
I'm so sorry.

265
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,515
(knock at door)

266
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:27,516
- Oh, Kurt.

267
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:30,852
Brenda? You're late again.

268
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:33,480
Please come to my office right away.

269
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,190
It's just not good enough, Kurt.

270
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:58,046
- Very good, men!

271
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:02,509
Dismissed!

272
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:03,343
- [Helen] Dieter, I'm sure it would help

273
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,636
if you spoke to Brenda.

274
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:07,472
- No. The staff is under
your control, Helen.

275
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:11,101
- I think the only one who
controls Brenda is our Kurt.

276
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:14,813
Kurt, it's Brenda I wanted to see.

277
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,358
What is it? What's the matter?

278
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:19,985
- I didn't do it.

279
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:20,902
- Do what?

280
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,074
(ominous music)

281
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,328
- Come.

282
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:30,245
Come!

283
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:11,370
- What...

284
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:13,121
What the hell happened here, Kurt?

285
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:17,042
- I didn't do this.

286
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,046
- We have to call the police.

287
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:25,342
- Police? Did you call the police?

288
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:27,010
- No. I didn't.

289
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:34,309
- This could ruin everything.

290
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:40,732
- I'll take care of I,
Dieter. Go to your office.

291
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,954
Now listen to me, Kurt.

292
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:55,330
I don't know what drove you to this,

293
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:56,957
but we'll deal with that later.

294
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,669
Right now, we need to help each other.

295
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:06,133
Can you understand what I'm saying, Kurt?

296
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:07,384
- Yes!

297
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:10,137
(ominous music)

298
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:39,207
- He's a bit calmer now.

299
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:44,087
I told him to stay in his
room for the rest of the day.

300
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,923
But first thing tomorrow, we
must get him into therapy.

301
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:51,052
We may have to sedate
him when Gantry arrives.

302
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:58,143
- Kurt?

303
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,313
- Oh, hi. How you doing?

304
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:02,898
- Have you seen Brenda?

305
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:05,025
- She went home for a
couple of days. Uh...

306
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:06,610
We had an argument.
- Oh.

307
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:07,736
- You know how it is.

308
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:13,074
Anyway, I'd best be going now. Take care.

309
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:20,165
- I loved her.

310
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:21,750
I lived off her.

311
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:26,213
You see,

312
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:32,427
I still had a desperate need
to see my mother's breast.

313
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:35,305
If I couldn't have
them, I had to see them.

314
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,934
(eerie music)

315
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:44,314
I watched bizarre love scenes.

316
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,611
They never did more than
take off their clothes.

317
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:52,656
Looking was beautiful.

318
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:58,995
My mother's exposure, glorious.

319
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:01,957
Her lover...

320
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,044
Enticing.

321
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,804
I thought they'd stop.

322
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:17,013
They always had.

323
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:24,854
Moved together.

324
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:27,857
Drifted toward the bed.

325
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:32,404
He threw her down and
brutally penetrated her.

326
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:34,864
I watched.

327
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:38,577
It wasn't like before.

328
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:43,081
She writhed in agony.

329
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:47,961
I saw the hatpin.

330
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,797
Oh, yes.

331
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:51,923
Yes!

332
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:57,345
But she passed out.

333
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:01,266
He left and I ran.

334
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:05,729
And no one ever said a word about it.

335
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:13,987
Six months later, she died.

336
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:18,158
Internal hemorrhaging.

337
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:25,457
You fix that, Doctor.

338
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:32,172
(eerie music)

339
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:48,707
- Shut the door.

340
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:23,450
- You okay?

341
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,035
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

342
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:26,953
- Yeah.

343
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:47,182
- Do you want me to leave?

344
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:57,043
You know why I'm here.

345
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,629
(eerie music)

346
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:33,830
- No!

347
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:35,915
No. This has gotta stop.

348
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,127
I gotta go to her.

349
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:40,378
- Who? Brenda?

350
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,464
Okay, come. Come.

351
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:46,175
Slowly. Slowly, Kurt.

352
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:47,844
Okay, slowly. Come.

353
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:49,888
Settle down.

354
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:01,316
Come.

355
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:05,612
(eerie music droning)

356
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,980
(Stephanie grunts)

357
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:49,197
(Stephanie gasps)

358
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:52,492
(Stephanie whimpering)

359
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:27,045
(ominous music)

360
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:43,436
(Kurt screaming)

361
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:01,704
(Kurt groaning)

362
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:13,758
(water dripping)

363
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:30,274
(Matt sobbing)

364
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:31,192
- Hey.

365
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:33,444
Hey.

366
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,698
(eerie music)

367
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:04,684
- Morning, Prescott.

368
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,064
Kurt?

369
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,025
Kurt?

370
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,778
(ominous music)

371
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:41,220
(Helen moans)

372
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:46,350
- No.

373
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:48,102
You calm down, okay?

374
00:44:55,276 --> 00:44:57,778
I want to see you in my office.

375
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:05,286
Oh. And lock this door behind you.

376
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:09,207
(eerie music)

377
00:45:29,185 --> 00:45:32,188
(airy new age music)

378
00:46:28,077 --> 00:46:30,496
(music stops)

379
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:32,581
- Hello.

380
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:36,585
You were with Kurt last night.

381
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:38,421
I heard you.

382
00:46:40,006 --> 00:46:42,591
(ominous music)

383
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:10,911
(eerie music)

384
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:25,718
- He was at the door. Prescott!

385
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:29,430
I can't.

386
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:32,475
I can't go on with this.
We have to call the police.

387
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:33,934
- No!

388
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:36,103
We cannot call the police now.

389
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:38,064
Listen, this is our life.

390
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:39,857
This is everything we worked for.

391
00:47:40,149 --> 00:47:42,818
Gantry arrives tomorrow.
We must hide the body.

392
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,570
It's only one day. One more day.

393
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:47,406
That's all I'm asking for, Helen.

394
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:49,325
One more day. Please?

395
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:03,714
Get me Prescott now, will you?

396
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,510
What is it, Paul?

397
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:08,719
- I gotta talk to you.

398
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:11,764
- Please, Helen.

399
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:21,774
- What was that all about, huh?

400
00:48:23,526 --> 00:48:25,694
Listen. Listen to me.

401
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:27,154
Things are happening.
- Yes.

402
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:28,906
- Everything is moving too fast!

403
00:48:29,198 --> 00:48:29,740
- Okay.

404
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:32,076
- Listen! I've been hibernating!

405
00:48:32,368 --> 00:48:34,829
Listen to me! It's like
I've been asleep, you know?

406
00:48:35,121 --> 00:48:36,205
I've stopped living!

407
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:39,333
But I'm waking up now.
She's getting to me.

408
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:41,168
I feel I can fuck her!

409
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,671
- I have a serious problem here!

410
00:48:43,963 --> 00:48:45,214
First Brenda, then Kurt,

411
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:47,466
and now this woman is going-
- Hey. Hey.

412
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,135
They're gone.

413
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:50,261
Good!

414
00:48:50,553 --> 00:48:54,098
Now, me! When are we getting the money?

415
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:55,307
When are we getting the money?

416
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,560
- Only a few more days,
I promise you. Okay?

417
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:01,397
- Hey. Hey, Doc.

418
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:03,232
You been telling me a
couple of months more,

419
00:49:03,524 --> 00:49:05,109
a couple of months more,
till it's two years!

420
00:49:05,401 --> 00:49:07,445
Two fucking years of
my life down the tube!

421
00:49:10,531 --> 00:49:13,117
I'm not gonna jeopardize
the scam, okay? Okay?

422
00:49:13,409 --> 00:49:15,161
I might be confused, but I'm not crazy.

423
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:21,000
(Dieter chuckles)

424
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:23,919
- Listen. We will get the money.

425
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:25,296
Trust me, huh?

426
00:49:25,588 --> 00:49:27,339
- Okay. Okay.

427
00:49:28,257 --> 00:49:30,176
We get the money, we split it.

428
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:31,969
You take your share, you go your way.

429
00:49:32,261 --> 00:49:34,555
I get my share, I go my way.
We go our separate ways, okay?

430
00:49:34,847 --> 00:49:36,265
And I don't want to see you again!

431
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:37,641
- [Dieter] Of course. Yes.

432
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:46,609
- Thank you, Doctor.

433
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:49,820
I don't want to talk to
you about this again.

434
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:55,326
Oh, Helen. Good luck with the grant.

435
00:49:55,618 --> 00:49:56,660
I hope you use it wisely.

436
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:03,584
- Prescott's on his way.

437
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:05,669
- Thank you.

438
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:09,089
(eerie music)

439
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:17,848
(Stephanie grunting)

440
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:33,113
(Stephanie grunts)

441
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:41,288
- What do you want?

442
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:42,748
- How are you doing?

443
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:46,961
- I don't want to talk to you, Paul.

444
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:48,712
- Okay. You wanna fuck.

445
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:53,842
- Is this another chapter?
- Maybe.

446
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:58,347
- I don't wanna be in it.

447
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:01,058
- Oh, it's too late for that.

448
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:02,685
Events have been set in motion, see,

449
00:51:02,977 --> 00:51:03,852
and you're part of them.

450
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:05,604
- Well, I'm not interested.

451
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:07,731
- You don't understand, do you?

452
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:12,111
You see, he has regained his potency,

453
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:16,407
but she lusts after the stud
of the funny farm, right?

454
00:51:16,699 --> 00:51:19,118
- Stop it, Paul! Just shut up!

455
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:21,829
- This place is a fraud, and you know it.

456
00:51:22,121 --> 00:51:23,247
But I suppose as a hiding place,

457
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:24,957
it's a perfect place to hide out.

458
00:51:27,835 --> 00:51:31,338
(Stephanie groans angrily)

459
00:51:34,967 --> 00:51:35,718
Have a good day.

460
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:52,484
- Confusion started with my parents.

461
00:51:55,404 --> 00:51:58,616
I hated my father's coarse skin,

462
00:52:00,701 --> 00:52:01,577
his foul breath,

463
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:04,538
and his stinking body.

464
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,043
But my mother...

465
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:11,879
Diana's...

466
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:15,549
Silks,

467
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:20,137
perfumes,

468
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:23,474
and warm body,

469
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:27,853
I adored.

470
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:32,524
She seduced me without ever knowing it.

471
00:52:37,196 --> 00:52:39,323
In my relationships,

472
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:43,827
I looked for a boy in a girl,

473
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:47,414
and a girl in a boy.

474
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:52,419
It was hopeless.

475
00:52:55,798 --> 00:52:57,883
Asexuality worked for a while,

476
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:00,260
but my lovers couldn't
accept my sexlessness.

477
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:07,559
They were enticed by a difficult conquest.

478
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:14,358
At 18, I severed my ties with men.

479
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:17,027
(Matt shrieks)

480
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:21,365
But society still can't accept that.

481
00:53:26,078 --> 00:53:27,454
- [Matt on Tape] So I'm here.

482
00:53:28,664 --> 00:53:30,457
And I want to stay.

483
00:53:35,254 --> 00:53:36,213
I want to stay.

484
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:42,594
- So, what do you think?

485
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:44,847
- [Dieter] I don't know.

486
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:46,849
Maybe he's smarter than we think, huh?

487
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:54,773
- I couldn't go back alone,
Dieter. To Kurt's room.

488
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,942
- We will take care of this later, yes?

489
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:58,360
But please come.

490
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:00,988
We must not let the others
think anything is wrong.

491
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:20,549
(ominous music)

492
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:33,187
(metallic clang)

493
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:02,007
- I could eat this meat.

494
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:04,760
- That's fine. That's fine, yeah.

495
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:07,513
- Shall I get some of the curry?

496
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:17,314
I saw the doctor today, Paul.

497
00:55:17,606 --> 00:55:18,565
- How'd it go?

498
00:55:20,192 --> 00:55:21,109
- All right.

499
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:38,627
- Dieter.

500
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:53,350
(eerie music)

501
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:02,192
Julia, what are you doing?

502
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:07,447
Julia?

503
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:10,951
What are you doing here?

504
00:56:12,995 --> 00:56:14,496
- I came to see Kurt.

505
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,457
- Why?

506
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:19,001
- Why is the door locked?

507
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:22,921
- Because he's not here.

508
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:23,839
- Where is he?

509
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:26,800
- He's, uh...

510
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:29,011
He's gone to be with Brenda.

511
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:30,721
- Why?

512
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:35,017
- Come and join us for dinner.

513
00:56:36,685 --> 00:56:39,229
- I'm not hungry. Don't want to eat.

514
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:42,983
- Well then, go back to your
room. It'll be all right.

515
00:56:43,275 --> 00:56:43,942
He's coming back.

516
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:53,160
It's okay.

517
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:01,668
(bell clangs)

518
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:05,714
- We have a very important announcement.

519
00:57:06,006 --> 00:57:10,344
I want Sister to tell you the good news.

520
00:57:10,636 --> 00:57:11,261
Please.

521
00:57:14,473 --> 00:57:16,266
- Over the past two years,

522
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:18,477
we have applied repeatedly for a grant

523
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:21,021
from the Foundation for
Better Mental Healthcare.

524
00:57:22,356 --> 00:57:26,109
Well, at long last, it seems
certain that we will get it.

525
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:30,072
Tomorrow, Mr. Gantry, the
chairman of the foundation,

526
00:57:30,364 --> 00:57:33,200
will be paying us a visit to
make his final inspection.

527
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:36,078
The doctor and I ask you all

528
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:40,332
to help make sure that everything
goes according to plan.

529
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:44,795
So please, be on your very best behavior.

530
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:46,755
Thank you.

531
00:57:48,507 --> 00:57:49,424
- Thank you.

532
00:57:57,766 --> 00:58:00,185
(eerie music)

533
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:37,180
(eerie music)

534
00:58:41,435 --> 00:58:44,521
(typewriter clacking)

535
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,451
- What are you doing?

536
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:40,368
- Flames.

537
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:44,581
It's the ultimate
seduction, you know that?

538
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:49,836
- Where's Stephanie?

539
00:59:54,508 --> 00:59:55,258
- Don't...

540
00:59:56,802 --> 00:59:58,345
Don't always run.

541
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:01,431
You gotta trust yourself.

542
01:00:05,811 --> 01:00:07,062
- Hey.

543
01:00:07,354 --> 01:00:08,396
- Relax, Nick.

544
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:18,073
You know, I used to fear what
I thought was your power.

545
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:20,575
You, Kurt,

546
01:00:21,785 --> 01:00:22,536
and now her.

547
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:26,039
Your sexuality.

548
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:29,042
The way you used to flaunt it.

549
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:32,337
Hold me.

550
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:45,976
Does it feel good?

551
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:50,147
This is what you want, isn't it?

552
01:00:52,399 --> 01:00:53,150
Hmm?

553
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:56,361
- Paul...

554
01:00:57,779 --> 01:01:00,907
- You don't have any
power, Nick. You're weak.

555
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:03,118
You play your fucking games

556
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:04,661
and you don't realize the consequences.

557
01:01:04,953 --> 01:01:05,996
- You're hurting me.

558
01:01:06,288 --> 01:01:08,290
- The real hurt happens here, inside.

559
01:01:09,875 --> 01:01:10,709
Do you understand?

560
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:18,341
I'm leaving in a couple of days.

561
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:20,051
I want you to take care of Matt.

562
01:01:21,428 --> 01:01:23,096
Look after him, you understand?

563
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:24,014
- Yes.

564
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:27,642
- Matthew is an innocent.

565
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:32,522
He's very special. Don't hurt him.

566
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:38,403
Okay.

567
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:41,948
If you help him,

568
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:44,576
you can help yourself.

569
01:01:47,245 --> 01:01:48,413
Go.

570
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:49,331
Go.

571
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:52,959
Go.

572
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:01,885
(wind rushing)

573
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:19,903
- [Gantry] Most interesting, Dieter.

574
01:02:20,195 --> 01:02:22,155
Not quite what I imagined.

575
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:24,908
- Are you sure we can't persuade you

576
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,117
to stay for some tea, Mr. Gantry?

577
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:27,702
- Oh, quite sure. Thank you, Helen.

578
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:30,538
I would like to meet some
of the patients though,

579
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:33,833
particularly the case
history you presented to us.

580
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:35,585
Paul, I think. What was his name?

581
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:38,880
- Oh, we do not disclose
patients' family names.

582
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:39,798
- Of course.

583
01:02:53,353 --> 01:02:54,104
- Mr. President!

584
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:58,525
We are honored and privileged
to welcome you in our country.

585
01:02:58,817 --> 01:02:59,693
- [Gantry] Thank you, General.

586
01:03:18,378 --> 01:03:20,088
- Shall I introduce you to Paul now?

587
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:22,924
- Yes, Helen. That would be nice.

588
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:28,596
- Paul? I'd like you to meet Mr. Gantry.

589
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:33,268
- Nice to meet you, Paul.

590
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:35,937
(wind rushing)

591
01:04:11,014 --> 01:04:14,309
If I were you, Dieter,
I wouldn't worry, okay?

592
01:04:14,601 --> 01:04:15,477
- Thank you.

593
01:04:15,769 --> 01:04:16,353
- Bye, Helen.

594
01:04:17,437 --> 01:04:18,271
We'll be in touch.

595
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:38,416
(gate creaks)

596
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:54,057
- [Julia] Lori's being Daddy,

597
01:04:54,349 --> 01:04:55,683
and I'm being Mommy.

598
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:59,729
We're lying on the bed,
holding each other.

599
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:02,065
- Why is Mommy holding Daddy?

600
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:05,652
- 'Cause he mustn't go away.

601
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:08,238
- Where is he going?

602
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:09,155
- Away.

603
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:11,491
- And then?

604
01:05:11,783 --> 01:05:14,077
(eerie music)

605
01:05:14,369 --> 01:05:15,912
- Uncle Jeff is watching us.

606
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:18,915
- Do you like him?

607
01:05:20,208 --> 01:05:20,959
- No.

608
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:27,215
He does things.

609
01:05:27,507 --> 01:05:28,716
- What?

610
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:29,759
- Can't say.

611
01:05:31,636 --> 01:05:32,387
- Julia?

612
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:37,517
- Mustn't say.

613
01:05:39,144 --> 01:05:39,978
- You can tell me.

614
01:05:44,732 --> 01:05:45,483
- Touching...

615
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:48,403
There.

616
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:52,240
Lori likes it.

617
01:05:53,408 --> 01:05:56,286
Lori likes Uncle Jeff. He gives her money.

618
01:05:58,121 --> 01:05:58,872
- What happened?

619
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:04,544
- Lori takes off her clothes.

620
01:06:04,836 --> 01:06:06,171
- [Dieter] Why?

621
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:08,256
- I don't know.

622
01:06:08,548 --> 01:06:09,632
- [Dieter] Tell me, Julia.

623
01:06:12,677 --> 01:06:14,137
- Uncle Jeff wants her to.

624
01:06:15,513 --> 01:06:16,264
- [Dieter] Then?

625
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:21,561
- They take off Mommy's clothes.

626
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:24,022
- [Dieter] Whose clothes, Julia?

627
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:29,736
- I can see them. They
off Julia's clothes.

628
01:06:35,909 --> 01:06:36,659
No.

629
01:06:39,287 --> 01:06:40,288
No more asking.

630
01:06:43,041 --> 01:06:43,791
- Julia.

631
01:06:47,462 --> 01:06:48,213
- Dieter?

632
01:06:50,507 --> 01:06:52,759
- Julia, you must come out now.

633
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:18,451
Do you know what just told me?

634
01:07:18,743 --> 01:07:19,369
- Yeah.

635
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:23,206
- [Dieter] How do you feel?

636
01:07:23,498 --> 01:07:24,123
- Empty.

637
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:26,584
Relieved.

638
01:07:28,253 --> 01:07:29,003
I don't know.

639
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:34,551
- We are having a little
celebration tonight.

640
01:07:50,108 --> 01:07:52,443
And so in a few days the grant will arrive

641
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:56,447
and we will be able to
start again, new and fresh.

642
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,409
Thank you.
(group applauds)

643
01:07:59,701 --> 01:08:01,911
Now let's enjoy this evening.

644
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:06,457
(group chattering)

645
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:16,092
(serene waltzing music)

646
01:08:18,177 --> 01:08:19,345
- Here, Doctor.

647
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:25,059
Trust me. We'll get the money.

648
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:27,520
- Paul?

649
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:30,898
Please.

650
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:33,192
Please, I beg of you. Don't...

651
01:08:33,484 --> 01:08:34,235
Don't spoil it now.

652
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:36,696
Hmm?

653
01:08:48,333 --> 01:08:50,001
- What would you do with the money?

654
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:52,962
- I don't know. How much is it?

655
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:54,631
- A lot.

656
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:59,427
Oh, I think the doctor
deserves it. Don't you?

657
01:08:59,719 --> 01:09:00,928
- I'm not sure.

658
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:01,846
- Why?

659
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:04,682
He does a lot for them.

660
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:06,851
And us.

661
01:09:07,935 --> 01:09:09,062
- You think so?

662
01:09:09,354 --> 01:09:10,563
- Yes, of course.

663
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:15,443
- This could mean a raise for us.

664
01:09:15,735 --> 01:09:17,111
- Mm, that'd be nice.

665
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:18,946
- Or they could get rid of us.

666
01:09:21,115 --> 01:09:21,949
- What do you mean?

667
01:09:24,077 --> 01:09:25,411
- Come on, Alice.

668
01:09:31,209 --> 01:09:33,795
(flies buzzing)

669
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:47,058
- Truce.

670
01:09:48,643 --> 01:09:50,395
- I'll give you this much:

671
01:09:52,230 --> 01:09:54,524
I've tried to figure you out, and I can't.

672
01:09:54,816 --> 01:09:57,443
- Well, you're looking
at the model patient.

673
01:09:57,735 --> 01:09:58,528
- You're drunk.

674
01:09:59,445 --> 01:10:01,322
- You're very beautiful.

675
01:10:01,614 --> 01:10:02,240
- So?

676
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:06,285
- Well, you want to dance?

677
01:10:06,577 --> 01:10:08,454
- One dance, and then you stop bugging me?

678
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:10,331
No touch.

679
01:10:11,749 --> 01:10:14,168
- Now where have I heard that before?

680
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:15,086
Come.

681
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:23,928
(bombastic symphonic music)

682
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:15,331
(Stephanie grunting)

683
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:18,918
You okay?

684
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:22,129
I'm not doing it right, huh?

685
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:24,465
Just show me.

686
01:12:24,757 --> 01:12:25,633
- It's...

687
01:12:25,925 --> 01:12:26,551
It's not that.

688
01:12:27,844 --> 01:12:29,136
- I'm clumsy. I...

689
01:12:29,428 --> 01:12:30,096
It's new for me.

690
01:12:32,598 --> 01:12:33,349
- No.

691
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:37,812
We're...
- What's wrong, Stephanie?

692
01:12:38,104 --> 01:12:42,108
I can feel you need me
too. It's not dirty.

693
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:45,903
- We're different. I should
never have come here.

694
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:49,323
(serene waltzing music)

695
01:13:17,518 --> 01:13:19,478
I can't make love to you.

696
01:13:21,272 --> 01:13:22,315
- Stephanie.

697
01:13:22,607 --> 01:13:23,232
Stephanie!

698
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:27,612
(Stephanie whimpers)

699
01:13:27,904 --> 01:13:31,616
- Listen, in 26 years,
I've been dead down here.

700
01:13:31,908 --> 01:13:32,825
You understand?

701
01:13:34,035 --> 01:13:35,202
You've given me life!

702
01:13:37,121 --> 01:13:38,915
I'm offering you my fucking virginity.

703
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:42,585
The least you can do is take it.

704
01:13:43,586 --> 01:13:44,337
Please?

705
01:13:45,713 --> 01:13:48,215
- I can't. I gotta go.

706
01:13:48,507 --> 01:13:49,133
- No.

707
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:55,014
Okay.

708
01:13:56,807 --> 01:13:57,558
Okay.

709
01:13:59,185 --> 01:13:59,936
Okay.

710
01:14:02,229 --> 01:14:02,980
Thank you.

711
01:14:05,942 --> 01:14:06,692
I'm grateful.

712
01:14:09,153 --> 01:14:12,657
I guess I can afford
to wait a while longer.

713
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:17,495
- But Paul...

714
01:14:20,331 --> 01:14:21,749
- I'm hurting, you know.

715
01:14:24,669 --> 01:14:25,419
Goodnight.

716
01:14:29,256 --> 01:14:32,510
(Stephanie moans sadly)

717
01:15:09,422 --> 01:15:11,966
- [Whispering Man] Julia.

718
01:15:12,258 --> 01:15:14,719
(pensive music)

719
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:19,890
Julia.

720
01:16:34,215 --> 01:16:37,134
(suspenseful music)

721
01:16:56,403 --> 01:16:58,989
(Julia screams)

722
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:10,334
(pensive music)

723
01:17:26,392 --> 01:17:28,811
(eerie music)

724
01:17:42,032 --> 01:17:43,367
- Battalions!

725
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:45,119
Time for inspection!

726
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:50,040
- Pass me the butter, please?

727
01:17:50,332 --> 01:17:50,958
- Yeah.

728
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:56,463
Did you have a nice night last night?

729
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:09,018
- Those shoes are dirty.

730
01:18:09,310 --> 01:18:10,519
Look at that hat!

731
01:18:18,652 --> 01:18:19,904
- Morning, Docsie.

732
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:25,784
Hi, guys.
- Morning, Paul.

733
01:18:26,076 --> 01:18:28,621
- God, this place is getting
emptier by the minute.

734
01:18:28,913 --> 01:18:29,538
Hey.

735
01:18:35,336 --> 01:18:36,879
Orange juice, please.

736
01:18:41,884 --> 01:18:42,718
Thank you.

737
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:45,763
- So, how are you feeling this morning?

738
01:18:46,805 --> 01:18:48,599
- Hungover and irritable.
- Ah.

739
01:18:48,891 --> 01:18:49,975
- If I got you in the sack last night,

740
01:18:50,267 --> 01:18:51,685
I would be feeling a lot better.

741
01:18:54,605 --> 01:18:57,816
You know something? I got
a good feeling about today.

742
01:19:02,029 --> 01:19:03,948
- I went to your room last night, Paul,

743
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:05,157
but you weren't there.

744
01:19:06,283 --> 01:19:07,618
- I got things to do, Matt.

745
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:11,622
- [Stephanie] We must talk, Paul.

746
01:19:11,914 --> 01:19:12,539
- [Paul] So?

747
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:14,333
- Alone.

748
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:21,340
Hey. I didn't mean right away.

749
01:19:21,632 --> 01:19:22,383
- That's all right.

750
01:19:29,682 --> 01:19:31,392
That was not necessary.

751
01:19:31,684 --> 01:19:32,935
- I didn't mean to chase him.

752
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:38,107
- So? Talk to me.

753
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:43,654
- I'm sorry about last night.

754
01:19:45,489 --> 01:19:46,240
- So am I.

755
01:19:51,704 --> 01:19:52,454
- Paul?

756
01:19:54,707 --> 01:19:55,457
I...

757
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:00,087
We shouldn't get too close.

758
01:20:01,046 --> 01:20:01,797
- Why not?

759
01:20:03,382 --> 01:20:04,300
- I'm not ready.

760
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:06,552
- Stephanie.

761
01:20:07,594 --> 01:20:08,512
Don't lie to me.

762
01:20:10,389 --> 01:20:11,473
Tell me the truth.

763
01:20:13,517 --> 01:20:14,935
- I'm scared.

764
01:20:15,227 --> 01:20:16,186
-So am I!

765
01:20:23,777 --> 01:20:26,697
- I've never been with a man before.

766
01:20:32,119 --> 01:20:33,162
I'm not well.

767
01:20:34,455 --> 01:20:36,040
We must stop this now.

768
01:20:39,418 --> 01:20:40,169
- Listen to me.

769
01:20:44,923 --> 01:20:46,467
I love you.

770
01:20:46,759 --> 01:20:48,135
- No!

771
01:20:48,427 --> 01:20:51,347
- I've never even thought
that about anyone before.

772
01:20:51,638 --> 01:20:54,183
(Stephanie sobs)

773
01:20:57,436 --> 01:20:58,437
Listen.

774
01:20:58,729 --> 01:21:00,731
Come with me. Come with me.

775
01:21:02,858 --> 01:21:04,109
Come on, please.

776
01:21:09,073 --> 01:21:11,950
- How easily you justify yourself.

777
01:21:12,242 --> 01:21:15,287
- What do you mean? I didn't
do any of the killing!

778
01:21:15,579 --> 01:21:16,580
- Really?

779
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:19,416
(brooding music)

780
01:21:45,275 --> 01:21:46,944
- Give her to me, General.

781
01:21:47,236 --> 01:21:47,861
- No.

782
01:21:49,613 --> 01:21:51,240
This soldier died for his country.

783
01:21:52,533 --> 01:21:54,410
- General, may I help?

784
01:21:56,620 --> 01:21:57,371
- No.

785
01:21:58,789 --> 01:22:01,500
- General, we promise to bury this soldier

786
01:22:01,792 --> 01:22:03,252
with full military honors.

787
01:22:08,257 --> 01:22:10,092
- Why must war be like this?

788
01:23:06,315 --> 01:23:08,734
- We must lock up this place
and find the killer now.

789
01:23:09,026 --> 01:23:09,943
- You do what you want.

790
01:23:11,111 --> 01:23:12,446
- I'm gonna call the others.

791
01:23:13,739 --> 01:23:17,159
Nicholas, please find Alice
and come to my office.

792
01:23:17,451 --> 01:23:18,076
Right away.

793
01:23:19,244 --> 01:23:20,787
We have to get everyone together.

794
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:23,749
- Keep me out of this, okay?

795
01:23:24,041 --> 01:23:24,666
- What?

796
01:23:27,586 --> 01:23:28,754
So now that you've got the grant,

797
01:23:29,046 --> 01:23:30,130
you think you can run away?

798
01:23:30,422 --> 01:23:31,215
Well, you can't.

799
01:23:31,507 --> 01:23:34,092
You're gonna stay here till
the bitter end, my friend.

800
01:23:35,677 --> 01:23:36,678
It can only be Paul.

801
01:23:37,846 --> 01:23:40,724
He's the one. Find Paul, he's responsible.

802
01:23:55,572 --> 01:23:56,323
Come in.

803
01:23:59,743 --> 01:24:02,162
(eerie music)

804
01:24:29,856 --> 01:24:31,233
- Matthew, where are they?

805
01:24:33,026 --> 01:24:34,194
- They've gone.

806
01:24:35,696 --> 01:24:38,115
(tense music)

807
01:24:42,786 --> 01:24:44,162
- They've left the dining room.

808
01:24:44,454 --> 01:24:46,206
- That's it. Stephanie's in danger.

809
01:24:46,498 --> 01:24:49,501
Nick, Alice, lock the front
gates and look for them.

810
01:24:49,793 --> 01:24:50,502
Be careful.

811
01:24:52,170 --> 01:24:55,173
Dieter, you have to help me find him.

812
01:25:17,988 --> 01:25:20,407
(door creaks)

813
01:25:47,893 --> 01:25:50,395
(clang echoes)

814
01:25:59,529 --> 01:26:02,032
(clang echoes)

815
01:26:23,595 --> 01:26:26,056
(clang echoes)

816
01:26:29,768 --> 01:26:32,187
(Matt shouts)

817
01:26:46,326 --> 01:26:48,745
(eerie music)

818
01:28:49,699 --> 01:28:52,285
(Paul grunting)

819
01:29:30,657 --> 01:29:33,243
(Paul grunting)

820
01:29:41,501 --> 01:29:44,004
(both moaning)

821
01:29:51,386 --> 01:29:53,889
(Paul screams)

822
01:29:55,307 --> 01:29:58,184
(cacophonous music)

823
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:11,281
- Stephanie!

824
01:30:11,573 --> 01:30:12,198
Stephanie!

825
01:30:34,095 --> 01:30:36,598
(Paul sobbing)

826
01:30:52,155 --> 01:30:52,906
Stephanie.

827
01:30:54,532 --> 01:30:57,369
(sobbing) Steph...

828
01:31:09,464 --> 01:31:11,800
(door opens)

829
01:31:13,927 --> 01:31:16,179
(Paul sobs)

830
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:22,519
(Paul groans)

831
01:31:34,364 --> 01:31:36,866
(Paul panting)

832
01:31:48,169 --> 01:31:50,839
(brooding music)
