1
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,349
Have you ever felt like
you were a little bit different?

2
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:55,386
Like you had something unique
to offer the world...

3
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:58,683
...if you could just get people
to see it.

4
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:04,159
Then you know exactly how it felt...

5
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,389
...to be me.

6
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:07,760
Go ahead, Flint.

7
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:14,303
What is the number one problem
facing our community today?

8
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:16,298
Untied shoelaces.

9
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:21,880
Which is why I've invented
a laceless alternative foot covering.

10
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:24,312
Spray-On Shoes.

11
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:30,122
- Voila.
- They're so nifty.

12
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:33,016
How you gonna get them off, nerd?

13
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:40,898
What a freak.
He wants to be smart, but that's lame.

14
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:49,467
I wanted to run away that day.

15
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:53,506
But you can't run away
from your own feet.

16
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,220
Not every sardine is meant
to swim, son.

17
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,753
I don't understand
fishing metaphors.

18
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,193
- What did I say?
- Don't worry.

19
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:18,163
Honey, I think your shoes
are wonderful.

20
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:20,636
Everyone just thinks I'm a weirdo.

21
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,172
So?

22
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:25,311
People probably thought
that these guys were weirdoes too.

23
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:28,544
But that never stopped them.

24
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:33,152
I was saving this
for your birthday, but here.

25
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:36,117
A professional-grade lab coat.

26
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:38,189
Just like the real guys wear.

27
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,893
It fits perfect.

28
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:45,030
The world needs
your originality, Flint.

29
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:48,891
You just have to grow into it.

30
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:52,697
And I know that you're gonna do
big things someday.

31
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:17,786
From that moment on...

32
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:21,263
...I was determined
to invent something great.

33
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:24,267
Remote Control Television.

34
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:28,130
And, the pitch is in.

35
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,266
Eventually.

36
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:32,604
Hair Un-Balder.

37
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,475
Flying Car.

38
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:40,047
Monkey Thought Translator.

39
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,949
- Hungry. Hungry. Hungry.
- How wise.

40
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:46,558
No, Steve. No, no, no, no, no!
No, please! Leave it...

41
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:48,616
Ratbirds.

42
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:50,888
Hey, what's going on, little guy?

43
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,055
Flint Lockwood.

44
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,829
My dream was to help
my hometown...

45
00:03:57,003 --> 00:04:00,632
...a tiny island hidden under
the "A" in "Atlantic"...

46
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,736
...called Swallow Falls.

47
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:06,574
We were famous for sardines...

48
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:11,076
...until the day the Baby Brent
Sardine Cannery closed for good.

49
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,846
Right after everyone in the world
realized that sardines...

50
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,215
...are super gross.

51
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:23,687
Soon, all of us were stuck eating
the sardines that no one else wanted.

52
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:30,200
Poached, fried, boiled, dried,
candied and juiced.

53
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,735
Life became gray and flavorless.

54
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:38,104
But when all seemed lost,
I stared at defeat...

55
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,343
...and found hope.

56
00:05:08,507 --> 00:05:10,975
My name is Flint Lockwood.

57
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:14,411
And I was about to invent
a machine...

58
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:16,410
...that turns water...

59
00:05:16,581 --> 00:05:18,742
...into food.

60
00:05:19,651 --> 00:05:23,644
Steve, my best friend
and trusted colleague.

61
00:05:24,055 --> 00:05:25,079
Steve.

62
00:05:25,257 --> 00:05:27,987
Can I count on your help?

63
00:05:30,395 --> 00:05:31,419
Can.

64
00:05:32,764 --> 00:05:34,356
I knew I could.

65
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:37,093
Button, on.
Memory, activate.

66
00:05:37,269 --> 00:05:41,137
Blueprints, awesome.
Begin nano-mutation.

67
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,901
Radiation matrix, secure.

68
00:05:44,476 --> 00:05:46,068
Computer, boot.

69
00:05:47,746 --> 00:05:49,907
Coolness enhancement, complete.

70
00:05:50,081 --> 00:05:51,912
Engage coffee break.

71
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,281
Networking power grid.

72
00:06:05,297 --> 00:06:08,289
Beginning conversion of water...

73
00:06:08,466 --> 00:06:10,127
...into food.

74
00:06:10,302 --> 00:06:12,361
Hydrating protein matrix.

75
00:06:12,837 --> 00:06:15,465
Calibrating flavor panel.

76
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,473
Priming chow plopper.

77
00:06:19,077 --> 00:06:22,137
Uploading cool machine voice.

78
00:06:23,515 --> 00:06:25,073
Cheeseburger.

79
00:06:26,017 --> 00:06:30,010
Everyone is going to love this.

80
00:06:55,814 --> 00:06:57,042
Flint!

81
00:06:57,215 --> 00:06:58,682
Sorry, Dad.

82
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,118
Steve, keep working.

83
00:07:04,522 --> 00:07:06,854
Scanning hand.

84
00:07:24,342 --> 00:07:26,936
That's a really weird dude.

85
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:34,078
Re-energizing tower unit.

86
00:07:39,224 --> 00:07:41,283
Jeez. See you, Dad.

87
00:07:42,994 --> 00:07:44,518
Flint.

88
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,796
Don't you think it's time to give up
this inventing thing, get a real job?

89
00:07:53,972 --> 00:07:55,462
No, why?

90
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:00,077
Well, all your technology stuff,
it just ends in disaster.

91
00:08:00,245 --> 00:08:03,112
The ratbirds, yes, they escaped
and bred at a surprising rate.

92
00:08:03,281 --> 00:08:05,943
But I took care of that problem
and disposed of them.

93
00:08:06,117 --> 00:08:07,948
Billy, just play dead.

94
00:08:08,119 --> 00:08:12,351
Flint, you don't keep throwing your net
where there aren't any fish.

95
00:08:12,524 --> 00:08:14,287
- What?
- I want you to work full-time...

96
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:17,155
...at the tackle shop.
- The tackle shop? Dad, no.

97
00:08:17,328 --> 00:08:18,920
Tackle is a good career.

98
00:08:19,097 --> 00:08:20,724
Please, I'm so close with this one.

99
00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:25,029
I just have to hook it up to the power
station and give it power and it'll work.

100
00:08:25,203 --> 00:08:27,228
And then you could sell food
in the shop...

101
00:08:27,405 --> 00:08:30,169
...and then everyone won't have to eat
sardines anymore.

102
00:08:30,341 --> 00:08:33,936
It is going to be so awesome.

103
00:08:34,646 --> 00:08:36,705
I'm sorry, son.

104
00:08:36,881 --> 00:08:38,007
No more inventing.

105
00:08:38,183 --> 00:08:41,311
Dad, I know I can do this.

106
00:08:41,486 --> 00:08:42,680
And Mom did too.

107
00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:48,484
It had been almost 10 years
since Mom died...

108
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,993
...and Dad still didn't understand me
like she did.

109
00:08:52,163 --> 00:08:55,621
Come on. Let's open the shop.

110
00:08:58,403 --> 00:09:01,270
Tim and Son
Sardine Bait and Tackle.

111
00:09:02,741 --> 00:09:04,538
You feeling it?

112
00:09:07,979 --> 00:09:10,880
Look out, Baby Brent!

113
00:09:12,817 --> 00:09:14,341
Baby Brent Sardines.

114
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:17,147
Hand-packed in Swallow Falls.

115
00:09:17,322 --> 00:09:22,123
As your mayor, I know it's time to put
our sardine-canning past behind us...

116
00:09:22,293 --> 00:09:24,591
...and look to the future.

117
00:09:24,763 --> 00:09:26,822
Sardine tourism!

118
00:09:28,233 --> 00:09:30,258
That's why,
without consulting anyone...

119
00:09:30,435 --> 00:09:34,064
...I spent the entire town budget
on the thing that is under this tarp...

120
00:09:34,239 --> 00:09:36,707
...which I will be unveiling today...

121
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,706
...at noon.

122
00:09:38,877 --> 00:09:43,507
Featuring a live appearance
by Baby Brent himself.

123
00:09:43,681 --> 00:09:46,980
What is up, everybody?

124
00:09:47,152 --> 00:09:49,086
- Hey.
- Hey, it's Baby Brent.

125
00:09:49,254 --> 00:09:53,315
What you doing? Stacking cans
with me on them as a baby?

126
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,192
Anyways, who wants to watch me
cut the ribbon...

127
00:09:58,363 --> 00:09:59,955
...at the mayor's unveiling thing?

128
00:10:00,131 --> 00:10:03,862
I'll be using these bad boys
to help save the town.

129
00:10:06,437 --> 00:10:09,270
All right, you guys.
Sardines, yeah.

130
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,274
- Swallow Falls forever!
- What a delight.

131
00:10:13,444 --> 00:10:17,278
Listen, you... Maybe you wanna go
to that unveiling?

132
00:10:17,448 --> 00:10:21,407
You know, Dad, why don't you
go ahead. I'll hold down the fort here.

133
00:10:21,586 --> 00:10:24,487
Really? You sure you can handle it?

134
00:10:24,656 --> 00:10:26,988
Yeah, Dad,
I'm pretty sure I'll be fine.

135
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:28,719
All right, then.

136
00:10:28,893 --> 00:10:31,828
I'll be back in half an hour, skipper.

137
00:10:31,996 --> 00:10:34,191
Okay. Bye.

138
00:10:42,006 --> 00:10:44,907
This hellhole is too small
for me, Brent.

139
00:10:45,076 --> 00:10:46,976
I wanna be big.

140
00:10:47,145 --> 00:10:51,605
I want people to look at me and say,
"That is one big mayor."

141
00:10:51,783 --> 00:10:53,648
And that's why this has to work.

142
00:10:53,818 --> 00:10:55,479
It has to work.

143
00:10:55,653 --> 00:10:58,816
Otherwise, I'm just a tiny mayor
of a tiny town...

144
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:02,357
...full of tiny sardine-sucking
knuckle-scrapers.

145
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,994
But not me, right?

146
00:11:04,162 --> 00:11:08,656
Oh, not you, Brent. No.
You've always been like a son to me.

147
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:13,499
Hey, everybody.

148
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:20,471
Under this tarp is the greatest tourist
attraction ever built by humans.

149
00:11:20,645 --> 00:11:23,239
We just need 17,000 more gigajoules.

150
00:11:23,414 --> 00:11:26,315
- An attraction so...
- Go, go, go.

151
00:11:27,752 --> 00:11:29,515
What are you doing, Flint Lockwood?

152
00:11:29,687 --> 00:11:32,212
Just holding my hands
behind my back respectfully, sir.

153
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,324
- You know what you are, Lockwood?
- No.

154
00:11:34,492 --> 00:11:36,323
A shenaniganizer.

155
00:11:36,494 --> 00:11:37,859
A tomfool.

156
00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:40,293
- You see my beautiful angel son Cal?
- What's up?

157
00:11:40,465 --> 00:11:42,956
I love him so much.
This is my only son.

158
00:11:43,134 --> 00:11:44,761
I want him to have a bright future.

159
00:11:44,936 --> 00:11:47,200
A future in which you don't ruin
our town's day...

160
00:11:47,372 --> 00:11:49,602
...with one of your
crazy science thingies.

161
00:11:49,774 --> 00:11:52,937
- Well, that's all behind me...
- You see this contact lens, Lockwood?

162
00:11:53,111 --> 00:11:55,170
- This contact lens represent you.
- All right.

163
00:11:55,346 --> 00:11:57,576
- And my eye represents my eye.
- Okay.

164
00:11:57,749 --> 00:12:02,482
I got my eye on you.

165
00:12:02,654 --> 00:12:05,919
- Oh, my gosh, a jaywalker.
- Hey.

166
00:12:06,591 --> 00:12:10,527
And I've arranged for live coverage
from a major network...

167
00:12:10,695 --> 00:12:14,256
...and their most experienced
professional reporter.

168
00:12:15,633 --> 00:12:18,466
Oh, just send the intern.
She's cute, and she's super perky.

169
00:12:18,636 --> 00:12:22,868
Well, those are the only things we look
for in a TV weatherperson. Intern.

170
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:26,238
How would you like to do a weather
report from a rinky-dink island...

171
00:12:26,411 --> 00:12:28,902
...in the middle of the ocean
as a favor to my cousin?

172
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,138
Really?

173
00:12:30,782 --> 00:12:32,181
Can you believe it, Manny?

174
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:35,911
Temporary
professional meteorologist.

175
00:12:36,087 --> 00:12:37,645
Okay, Manny, what about this?

176
00:12:37,822 --> 00:12:39,653
Welcome, America,
I'm Sam Sparks.

177
00:12:39,824 --> 00:12:42,190
Hello, America, Sam Sparks here.

178
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,419
America, hi. I didn't see you there.

179
00:12:44,595 --> 00:12:45,960
It's me, Sam Sparks.

180
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:50,499
On my way across the ocean.

181
00:12:51,002 --> 00:12:55,632
Now, when she gets here,
I wanna see a lot of smiling faces.

182
00:12:55,807 --> 00:12:57,468
Act like, "Hey, whoa."

183
00:12:58,176 --> 00:13:01,475
This is a great idea.

184
00:13:02,146 --> 00:13:03,670
Weather News Network.

185
00:13:03,848 --> 00:13:05,475
Weather news happens...

186
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:06,981
...or not.

187
00:13:07,151 --> 00:13:08,743
Now we're over to Swallow Falls...

188
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,252
...where our intern
is on her first day on the job.

189
00:13:11,422 --> 00:13:14,084
Or should I say, first gray on the job.

190
00:13:14,258 --> 00:13:15,850
Looks pretty cloudy there, intern.

191
00:13:16,027 --> 00:13:17,961
Hello, Sam Sparks, I'm America.

192
00:13:18,496 --> 00:13:23,399
It's Swallow Falls degrees and...
Well, let's just go to the mayor.

193
00:13:23,568 --> 00:13:27,868
Thank you and welcome,
national television audience.

194
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:32,635
You are about to witness
an historic event, undoubtedly...

195
00:13:36,047 --> 00:13:39,380
And now, here to cut
the ceremonial ribbon...

196
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:44,749
...Swallow Falls' favorite son,
Baby Brent!

197
00:13:44,922 --> 00:13:46,287
He's still got it, folks.

198
00:13:46,457 --> 00:13:47,583
Yeah.

199
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:53,256
I'm the best person
in the whole town.

200
00:13:58,603 --> 00:14:01,538
Food synthesis, go.

201
00:14:03,641 --> 00:14:07,543
My chest hairs are tingling.
Something's wrong.

202
00:14:08,312 --> 00:14:13,579
Well, here it is. The attraction
the whole world has been waiting for:

203
00:14:13,751 --> 00:14:15,878
Sardine Land.

204
00:14:18,122 --> 00:14:20,249
With rides and exhibits.

205
00:14:20,425 --> 00:14:24,486
And featuring Shamo,
the world's largest sardine...

206
00:14:24,662 --> 00:14:27,893
...and his flaming hoop of glory.

207
00:14:28,766 --> 00:14:31,758
Those of you in the splash zone,
look out.

208
00:14:31,936 --> 00:14:33,062
Yeah.

209
00:14:40,111 --> 00:14:41,942
Cheeseburger.

210
00:14:42,113 --> 00:14:43,171
Flint Lockwood.

211
00:14:43,347 --> 00:14:46,578
Just a second.
I'm in the middle of a...

212
00:14:55,159 --> 00:15:01,291
Well, looks like things in Swallow Falls
are sardine to get better. For...

213
00:15:01,466 --> 00:15:03,229
What just happened to me?

214
00:15:03,401 --> 00:15:04,561
Sorry.

215
00:15:26,124 --> 00:15:27,955
No.

216
00:15:28,893 --> 00:15:30,588
You're under arrest, Flint Lockwood.

217
00:15:30,761 --> 00:15:35,198
Thank goodness you only caused
minimal damage to Sardine Land.

218
00:15:41,105 --> 00:15:42,129
Come on.

219
00:15:51,682 --> 00:15:54,173
I really shouldn't be running
with these.

220
00:15:57,622 --> 00:16:00,284
Jump, jump, jump, run, run,
jump, jump, run.

221
00:16:21,979 --> 00:16:24,573
- It's a good thing no one got hurt!
- Flint Lockwood!

222
00:16:24,749 --> 00:16:28,947
I didn't get hurt, but that does
not mean that I'm not still mad at you.

223
00:17:34,218 --> 00:17:36,448
Oh, my gosh. I am so sorry.
Are you okay?

224
00:17:36,621 --> 00:17:39,613
- I didn't get a chance to...
- It's okay, it's just pain.

225
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,382
Sorry, I'm not myself today.

226
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:46,496
My whole career was ruined by some
crazy jerk riding a homemade rocket.

227
00:17:47,598 --> 00:17:49,259
Wait a minute.

228
00:17:49,433 --> 00:17:51,901
What is going on with your feet?

229
00:17:52,069 --> 00:17:54,799
Spray-On Shoes.
They don't come off.

230
00:17:54,972 --> 00:17:56,337
Cool.

231
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,233
This could solve
the untied shoes epidemic.

232
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:02,470
What are they made of, some kind of
elastic biopolymer adhesive?

233
00:18:02,647 --> 00:18:04,080
Yeah.

234
00:18:04,248 --> 00:18:05,272
Exactly.

235
00:18:05,449 --> 00:18:07,178
I mean...

236
00:18:07,618 --> 00:18:10,985
Wow, they're shiny. I'm Sam.

237
00:18:11,922 --> 00:18:13,150
- Flint.
- Steve.

238
00:18:13,758 --> 00:18:16,318
- Is that a Monkey Thought Translator?
- Steve.

239
00:18:17,695 --> 00:18:22,029
Incredible.
Did you make all of this stuff?

240
00:18:22,433 --> 00:18:25,163
- You hit me with a rocket.
- You kicked me in the face.

241
00:18:25,336 --> 00:18:27,429
I said I was sorry.

242
00:18:28,239 --> 00:18:31,606
Do you know how hard it is
to break into the weather game?

243
00:18:31,776 --> 00:18:35,473
I spent my entire life building up
to that moment.

244
00:18:36,247 --> 00:18:38,374
You get one shot at the show.

245
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:40,642
And if you don't make it...

246
00:18:40,818 --> 00:18:44,310
...it's back to cleaning
the barometers.

247
00:18:51,395 --> 00:18:53,056
Cheese?

248
00:18:57,501 --> 00:19:01,232
But that could only mean...

249
00:19:48,352 --> 00:19:51,253
Excited. Excited.

250
00:20:01,665 --> 00:20:03,030
My machine works.

251
00:20:04,902 --> 00:20:09,066
It really works!

252
00:20:12,109 --> 00:20:13,599
Your machine?

253
00:20:13,778 --> 00:20:15,473
Is that what that rocket was?

254
00:20:16,981 --> 00:20:18,608
Do you like it?

255
00:20:19,016 --> 00:20:20,040
I love it!

256
00:20:20,518 --> 00:20:22,952
This is just amazing.
Look at this.

257
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,918
This is the greatest weather
phenomenon in history.

258
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:28,058
Hey, aren't you a weathergirl?

259
00:20:30,961 --> 00:20:32,929
Manny, get your camera.

260
00:20:48,512 --> 00:20:52,949
This just in: Our humiliated weather
intern is apparently back for more.

261
00:20:53,117 --> 00:20:56,416
Thanks, Patrick. Okay, everybody,
you are not gonna believe this one...

262
00:20:56,587 --> 00:21:01,024
...but I am standing
in the middle of a burger rain.

263
00:21:01,192 --> 00:21:02,819
You may have seen
a meteor shower...

264
00:21:02,993 --> 00:21:06,793
...but you've never seen a shower
meatier than this.

265
00:21:06,964 --> 00:21:11,094
For a town stuck eating sardines,
this is totally manna from heaven.

266
00:21:11,268 --> 00:21:14,260
This tastes significantly better
than sardines.

267
00:21:21,278 --> 00:21:23,940
This is going to be big.

268
00:21:24,114 --> 00:21:26,207
This food weather
was created intentionally...

269
00:21:26,383 --> 00:21:29,580
...by meek-ish backyard tinkerer
Flint Lockwood.

270
00:21:29,753 --> 00:21:31,744
Flint Lockwood?

271
00:21:31,922 --> 00:21:32,946
Hi.

272
00:21:33,123 --> 00:21:35,182
You're under arrest
for ruining Sardine Land.

273
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:36,951
Flint, those burgers were awesome.

274
00:21:37,127 --> 00:21:40,494
The producer called and he was like,
"Everybody loves that food weather."

275
00:21:40,664 --> 00:21:41,858
- Food weather.
- What?

276
00:21:42,032 --> 00:21:43,829
This could be bigger
than Sardine Land.

277
00:21:44,001 --> 00:21:45,764
- Can you make it rain food again?
- No.

278
00:21:45,936 --> 00:21:48,131
- I don't know if l...
- You're gonna do it again?

279
00:21:48,305 --> 00:21:49,636
You gotta be kidding.

280
00:21:49,807 --> 00:21:52,002
Please, please, please.

281
00:21:54,912 --> 00:21:56,709
- Yes.
- No.

282
00:21:56,881 --> 00:21:59,577
- Give me one more chance.
- We know this was an accident.

283
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,877
- I know.
- Cheeseburgers from the sky...

284
00:22:02,052 --> 00:22:03,644
...that's not natural.

285
00:22:03,821 --> 00:22:06,483
My invention could save
the whole town.

286
00:22:06,657 --> 00:22:09,251
You will be so proud of me, Dad.

287
00:22:09,426 --> 00:22:11,223
Plus...

288
00:22:11,395 --> 00:22:12,760
...there's a girl here.

289
00:22:15,065 --> 00:22:19,024
Can you look me in the eye and
tell me you've got this under control...

290
00:22:19,203 --> 00:22:21,228
...and it's not gonna end up
in a disaster?

291
00:22:22,106 --> 00:22:23,368
Yes.

292
00:22:37,955 --> 00:22:41,049
I've got this under control,
and it's not gonna end in disaster.

293
00:22:43,327 --> 00:22:45,386
- All right.
- Thanks, Dad.

294
00:22:45,563 --> 00:22:48,794
- Oh, sure.
- Okay. So, Sam...

295
00:22:48,966 --> 00:22:53,062
...this is where the magic happens.

296
00:22:54,371 --> 00:22:57,738
Lick. Lick. Lick.

297
00:22:57,908 --> 00:23:01,139
Lick. Lick. Lick.

298
00:23:02,613 --> 00:23:04,046
Welcome, Flint.

299
00:23:06,417 --> 00:23:08,977
You seriously spend
a lot of time alone.

300
00:23:09,153 --> 00:23:10,586
What?

301
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,487
So here's how it works.

302
00:23:14,658 --> 00:23:18,651
Water goes in the top,
and food comes out the bottom.

303
00:23:18,829 --> 00:23:20,694
When you shot it
into the stratosphere...

304
00:23:20,864 --> 00:23:24,595
...you figured it would induce a phase
change from the cumulonimbus layer?

305
00:23:24,768 --> 00:23:27,760
That's actually
a really smart observation.

306
00:23:27,938 --> 00:23:29,633
I mean...

307
00:23:30,441 --> 00:23:32,875
The clouds probably have water
in them...

308
00:23:33,043 --> 00:23:36,444
...which, I guess, is why
you shot it up there in the first place.

309
00:23:36,614 --> 00:23:38,741
Right, right. That's why I did that.

310
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:40,907
- On purpose.
- Right. Yeah.

311
00:23:41,085 --> 00:23:42,814
- Right.
- Of course.

312
00:23:44,355 --> 00:23:45,913
Okay.

313
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:49,184
The machine uses a principle
of hydro-genetic mutation.

314
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,352
Water molecules are bombarded
with microwave radiation...

315
00:23:52,529 --> 00:23:55,987
...which mutates their genetic recipe
into any kind of food you want.

316
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:57,326
So...

317
00:23:57,501 --> 00:23:58,525
- Pizza?
- Yes.

318
00:23:58,702 --> 00:23:59,828
- Mashed potatoes?
- Yes.

319
00:24:00,004 --> 00:24:01,471
- Peas?
- Yes, that's also a food.

320
00:24:01,639 --> 00:24:02,867
- Steak? Apples?
- Yes.

321
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,473
- Apple sauce? BLT?
- Yes.

322
00:24:04,642 --> 00:24:06,803
- I said any kind of food.
- Chicken wings?

323
00:24:06,977 --> 00:24:09,639
Think about what you're saying,
and if it's a food, yes.

324
00:24:09,813 --> 00:24:12,111
- Baloney.
- Baloney. That is a food.

325
00:24:12,282 --> 00:24:14,546
- How about Jell-O?
- Do you like Jell-O?

326
00:24:14,718 --> 00:24:16,185
I love Jell-O.

327
00:24:16,353 --> 00:24:18,753
I love Jell-O too.
Oh, and peanut butter, right?

328
00:24:18,922 --> 00:24:21,322
Oh, no, no, no,
I am severely allergic to peanuts.

329
00:24:21,492 --> 00:24:22,516
Hey, me too.

330
00:24:22,693 --> 00:24:24,285
- What's it called?
- Peanut allergy.

331
00:24:24,461 --> 00:24:25,519
- No, the machine.
- Of course.

332
00:24:26,096 --> 00:24:28,894
It's called the Flint Lockwood
Diatonic Super-Mutating...

333
00:24:29,066 --> 00:24:31,193
...Dynamic Food Replicator.

334
00:24:31,368 --> 00:24:33,029
Or, for short:

335
00:24:33,203 --> 00:24:34,966
The FLDSMDFR.

336
00:24:35,472 --> 00:24:36,564
Fliminadifiser?

337
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,071
FLDSMDFR.

338
00:24:38,242 --> 00:24:39,641
Fliminubahdibferer?

339
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:41,437
Fli.

340
00:24:41,612 --> 00:24:43,375
Suh.

341
00:24:43,647 --> 00:24:44,909
Fdiferf.

342
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:49,151
Manny, make sure you get this.
He's gonna make the food now.

343
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:50,343
Now?

344
00:24:50,521 --> 00:24:54,252
Well, the thing is, I can't...

345
00:24:54,425 --> 00:24:57,485
...wait to show you
this hilarious Internet video.

346
00:24:58,595 --> 00:24:59,619
What?

347
00:24:59,797 --> 00:25:01,025
Fight the power!

348
00:25:01,198 --> 00:25:03,166
What is this?

349
00:25:07,638 --> 00:25:08,935
It's so cute.

350
00:25:09,106 --> 00:25:10,937
Pushing. Folding. Connecting.

351
00:25:11,108 --> 00:25:13,906
Taping. Turning.
Painting. Switching.

352
00:25:14,078 --> 00:25:15,204
Staring.

353
00:25:15,379 --> 00:25:16,744
Motivating.

354
00:25:16,914 --> 00:25:19,439
- Placing button.
- I can't believe I've been watching this...

355
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:21,675
...for three hours.
- I know.

356
00:25:30,928 --> 00:25:32,122
It's working.

357
00:25:32,296 --> 00:25:34,287
What do you guys want for breakfast?

358
00:25:34,465 --> 00:25:36,456
- Gummi Bears.
- Whoa, Steve, no.

359
00:25:36,633 --> 00:25:38,794
We both know how you get
around Gummi Bears.

360
00:25:38,969 --> 00:25:40,368
How about...

361
00:25:40,537 --> 00:25:42,095
...eggs.
- And toast.

362
00:25:42,272 --> 00:25:43,569
Orange juice.

363
00:25:43,741 --> 00:25:45,436
- And bacon.
- Bacon.

364
00:25:46,443 --> 00:25:47,774
What are you doing?

365
00:25:47,945 --> 00:25:49,378
Nothing.

366
00:25:49,546 --> 00:25:50,570
To the computer.

367
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:57,953
So you're sure this is safe?

368
00:25:58,489 --> 00:26:00,980
Don't worry. I have a Dangeometer
that lets us know...

369
00:26:01,158 --> 00:26:02,921
...if the food is going
to over-mutate.

370
00:26:03,093 --> 00:26:04,993
What happens
if the food over-mutates?

371
00:26:05,162 --> 00:26:07,562
I don't know.
But that'll never happen.

372
00:26:07,731 --> 00:26:10,097
All right, this probably
won't explode.

373
00:26:10,267 --> 00:26:11,291
What?

374
00:26:18,008 --> 00:26:19,669
Bacon.

375
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,343
Those cheeseburgers
were only the beginning...

376
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:31,283
...because a breakfast system
is on its way to Swallow Falls.

377
00:26:31,455 --> 00:26:32,649
My forecast?

378
00:26:32,823 --> 00:26:34,757
Sunny side up.

379
00:26:42,132 --> 00:26:44,600
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

380
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:56,511
Flint, my boy. Can you do lunch?

381
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,011
All right, here's the skinny:

382
00:26:58,182 --> 00:27:01,049
You keep making it rain
the snackadoos...

383
00:27:01,218 --> 00:27:03,186
...weathergirl provides
free advertising...

384
00:27:03,353 --> 00:27:05,548
...I have taken out
a very high-interest loan...

385
00:27:05,722 --> 00:27:08,782
...to convert this Podunk town
into a tourist food-topia.

386
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:12,360
All you have to do is make it rain food
three meals a day...

387
00:27:12,529 --> 00:27:14,497
...every day
for the foreseeable future...

388
00:27:14,665 --> 00:27:17,429
...and in 30 days we hold a grand
reopening of the island...

389
00:27:17,601 --> 00:27:20,399
...as a must-see cruise destination.

390
00:27:20,571 --> 00:27:23,199
And everyone, everywhere...

391
00:27:23,373 --> 00:27:27,707
...is going to love your invention.

392
00:27:28,078 --> 00:27:29,375
Do you think so?

393
00:27:29,546 --> 00:27:31,980
I know so.

394
00:27:36,353 --> 00:27:39,345
Now that's what I call
poultry in motion.

395
00:27:49,266 --> 00:27:51,826
Mr. Lockwood,
may I please have waffles?

396
00:27:52,002 --> 00:27:53,333
- Falafels?
- Jellybeans.

397
00:27:53,503 --> 00:27:54,868
- Avocado.
- Coming right up.

398
00:27:57,741 --> 00:27:58,935
Leftovers?

399
00:27:59,109 --> 00:28:02,476
Not a problem with Flint Lockwood's
latest invention, the Outtasighter...

400
00:28:02,646 --> 00:28:05,547
...so-named because it catapults
uneaten food out of sight...

401
00:28:05,716 --> 00:28:08,207
...and therefore, out of mind.

402
00:28:16,894 --> 00:28:18,589
Jellybeans!

403
00:28:18,762 --> 00:28:19,786
Awesome.

404
00:28:19,963 --> 00:28:22,261
- BLT.
- Doughnuts.

405
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,465
Pie.

406
00:28:24,635 --> 00:28:25,659
Gummi bears.

407
00:28:25,869 --> 00:28:28,133
- Fish.
- Crème brulee!

408
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,474
A pizza stuffed inside a turkey...

409
00:28:32,643 --> 00:28:35,441
...the whole thing deep-fried
and dipped in chocolate.

410
00:28:36,146 --> 00:28:38,011
It's me, the mayor.

411
00:28:38,615 --> 00:28:39,980
You look different.

412
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:41,913
Did you get a new haircut?

413
00:28:42,085 --> 00:28:44,110
Yes, I did. Thank you for noticing.

414
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:53,196
- I love you.
- Thanks, Dad. I love you.

415
00:28:53,196 --> 00:28:54,720
- I love you.
- Thanks, Dad. I love you.

416
00:28:54,898 --> 00:28:56,661
I love spending time with you, Dad.

417
00:29:00,938 --> 00:29:03,566
Hey, Dad, I'm headed back
to the lab.

418
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:07,574
If you wanna come,
I could show you how I make the food.

419
00:29:08,078 --> 00:29:09,568
No, thanks.

420
00:29:09,746 --> 00:29:14,877
That techno-food, it's too complicated
for an old fisherman.

421
00:29:15,052 --> 00:29:16,917
Got it.

422
00:29:17,854 --> 00:29:21,255
Could still use your help around here,
though, you know.

423
00:29:21,425 --> 00:29:24,087
I'm working
with the mayor now, Dad.

424
00:29:24,261 --> 00:29:27,424
I mean, the town's grand reopening
is in, like, a week.

425
00:29:27,597 --> 00:29:29,861
Right. Got it.

426
00:29:36,573 --> 00:29:38,905
Flint Lockwood?

427
00:29:39,543 --> 00:29:41,170
Yeah?

428
00:29:42,646 --> 00:29:44,910
It's my son Cal's birthday
tomorrow...

429
00:29:45,082 --> 00:29:48,483
...and I was just wondering if you
could make it rain something special.

430
00:29:48,652 --> 00:29:51,052
Well, I'm pretty backed up
on requests.

431
00:29:51,221 --> 00:29:52,882
Plus, you're always mean to me.

432
00:29:53,056 --> 00:29:54,887
It'll be just one time...

433
00:29:55,058 --> 00:29:57,526
...for my special angel's special day.

434
00:29:58,795 --> 00:30:00,160
I don't know.

435
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:03,629
You know, I don't wanna
overwork the machine, so...

436
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,292
Okay. I knew it was a long shot.

437
00:30:07,471 --> 00:30:10,201
I just wanted Cal to see how much
his father loves him.

438
00:30:10,374 --> 00:30:12,137
I thought you would understand.

439
00:30:15,112 --> 00:30:17,307
You know how fathers always trying
to express...

440
00:30:17,481 --> 00:30:21,144
...their love and appreciation
for their sons.

441
00:30:24,988 --> 00:30:26,046
Earl, wait.

442
00:30:37,534 --> 00:30:39,695
Touch. Touch. Touch.

443
00:30:41,838 --> 00:30:43,066
I've got an idea.

444
00:31:01,158 --> 00:31:03,058
Happy birthday, son.

445
00:31:03,226 --> 00:31:04,386
Dad?

446
00:31:04,561 --> 00:31:06,893
This is your day. Go have fun.

447
00:31:07,064 --> 00:31:10,625
- I love you guys. You're awesome.
- I love you too, son.

448
00:31:10,801 --> 00:31:14,396
- Have a good time, baby.
- Ice cream!

449
00:31:15,272 --> 00:31:18,366
Yeah! Cool.

450
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,705
Strawberry's my favorite.

451
00:31:34,958 --> 00:31:35,982
Come on, Dad.

452
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:37,649
I don't know, Cal.

453
00:31:37,828 --> 00:31:40,194
This doesn't look safe!

454
00:31:48,105 --> 00:31:49,231
I love you, son.

455
00:31:49,406 --> 00:31:52,569
I know, Dad. You tell me every day.

456
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,443
Flint, this is amazing.

457
00:31:58,615 --> 00:32:01,209
And designing the ice cream
to accumulate into scoops...

458
00:32:01,384 --> 00:32:03,284
...I don't know how
you're gonna top this.

459
00:32:03,453 --> 00:32:06,320
Maybe with hot fudge.

460
00:32:08,492 --> 00:32:09,584
Hey, Flint.

461
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:11,784
You wanna be in a snowball fight
with us?

462
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:14,922
Flint, what's the problem?

463
00:32:15,098 --> 00:32:17,293
I've never actually been
in a snowball fight.

464
00:32:17,467 --> 00:32:19,697
- Really?
- I don't even know the rules.

465
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:23,499
Is there like a point system or is it...

466
00:32:23,673 --> 00:32:25,538
...to the death?
- No...

467
00:32:25,709 --> 00:32:30,737
You've nev...? I mean, look, even
Steve is throwing chocolate snowballs.

468
00:32:35,452 --> 00:32:38,888
So like this?

469
00:32:39,422 --> 00:32:41,617
No, harder than that.

470
00:32:44,027 --> 00:32:46,621
Snowball.
Snowball, snowball, snowball.

471
00:32:47,631 --> 00:32:50,122
Snowball. Snowball.

472
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,292
Well, something to be said
for enthusiasm.

473
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:55,462
Snowball!

474
00:32:55,972 --> 00:32:57,564
Snowball!

475
00:33:00,777 --> 00:33:02,677
Snowball and snowball.

476
00:33:02,846 --> 00:33:03,904
Kids? What's going on?

477
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,173
Snowball.

478
00:33:07,417 --> 00:33:09,248
- Snowball.
- Snowball. Snowball.

479
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:10,750
I scream, you scream...

480
00:33:10,921 --> 00:33:15,221
...we all scream for Flint Lockwood's
latest tasty town-wide treat...

481
00:33:15,392 --> 00:33:18,452
...with flurries of frozen fun
on what the mayor declared to be...

482
00:33:18,628 --> 00:33:20,061
...an ice cream snow day.

483
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:23,757
He'd also like to invite everyone
in the world to catch a cruise liner...

484
00:33:23,934 --> 00:33:25,561
...and come on down
this Saturday...

485
00:33:25,735 --> 00:33:28,226
...for the grand opening
of Chew And Swallow...

486
00:33:28,405 --> 00:33:31,568
...a town that is truly a la mode.

487
00:33:39,282 --> 00:33:42,342
A town that is truly
topped with ice cream.

488
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:45,454
With today's scoop
for the Weather News Network...

489
00:33:45,622 --> 00:33:47,988
...I'm Sam Sparks.

490
00:33:48,158 --> 00:33:51,889
Flint, this is the best breakfast ever.

491
00:33:58,435 --> 00:33:59,459
That's it!

492
00:33:59,636 --> 00:34:01,365
Researching. Role-playing.

493
00:34:01,538 --> 00:34:02,937
Dialing.

494
00:34:03,106 --> 00:34:04,733
Waiting.

495
00:34:06,977 --> 00:34:08,877
- Sam Sparks.
- Hanging up.

496
00:34:09,045 --> 00:34:11,275
Regretting. Re-psyching.

497
00:34:11,448 --> 00:34:13,313
Saying what I'm doing.

498
00:34:13,483 --> 00:34:15,508
- Flint?
- "Hi, Sam, how are you? That's nice.

499
00:34:15,685 --> 00:34:17,949
I was wondering if you would like
to go on a da..."

500
00:34:18,121 --> 00:34:19,452
Activity with me tomorrow.

501
00:34:21,524 --> 00:34:23,958
- Okay.
- Great, bye. Meet me in the forest.

502
00:34:24,127 --> 00:34:26,561
Nailed it. Gotta go, Steve.

503
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:29,790
Keep an eye on the lab for me.

504
00:34:31,334 --> 00:34:33,700
Steve.

505
00:34:34,137 --> 00:34:35,832
Foster still at the plate.

506
00:34:36,006 --> 00:34:37,940
And nobody out.

507
00:34:38,108 --> 00:34:39,575
Where are we going?

508
00:34:39,743 --> 00:34:41,973
Oh, nowhere.
I just thought it'd be nice...

509
00:34:42,145 --> 00:34:46,206
...for the two of us
to go on a walk together.

510
00:34:46,383 --> 00:34:49,409
Like you do as friends.

511
00:34:49,853 --> 00:34:52,913
Oh, my, what's that?

512
00:35:01,998 --> 00:35:03,659
Jell-O's my favorite.

513
00:35:04,334 --> 00:35:06,632
You never made a request, so...

514
00:35:06,803 --> 00:35:08,634
...I made one for you.

515
00:35:11,474 --> 00:35:13,305
Flint?

516
00:35:13,476 --> 00:35:14,841
Flint?

517
00:35:15,245 --> 00:35:16,872
Join me.

518
00:35:30,593 --> 00:35:31,719
But how did you...?

519
00:35:31,895 --> 00:35:35,092
I made it rain Jell-O, then I gathered
it up with the Outtasighter...

520
00:35:35,265 --> 00:35:37,392
...and then I brought it here
and pressed it...

521
00:35:37,567 --> 00:35:41,128
...into a gigantic custom-carved plastic
Tupperware mold I made. No big deal.

522
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:45,337
Everything's made of Jell-O.

523
00:35:45,508 --> 00:35:46,998
This piano, those sconces...

524
00:35:47,177 --> 00:35:49,645
...that ghetto blaster, that Jell-O,
that aquarium...

525
00:35:49,813 --> 00:35:51,906
...that Venus de Milo
with your face on it...

526
00:35:52,082 --> 00:35:55,017
...next to a Michelangelo's David
that also has your face.

527
00:35:55,819 --> 00:35:59,016
Come on, Sam,
what are you waiting for?

528
00:36:01,191 --> 00:36:02,488
Nothing!

529
00:36:05,228 --> 00:36:06,252
Yeah.

530
00:36:19,275 --> 00:36:21,004
Cannonball.

531
00:36:22,412 --> 00:36:23,879
Belly flop.

532
00:36:27,517 --> 00:36:29,508
Why did I do that?

533
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,994
- So Jell-O.
- Right. Right, right.

534
00:36:40,163 --> 00:36:41,630
It's a solid, it's a liquid...

535
00:36:41,798 --> 00:36:46,292
...it's a visco-elastic polymer made of
polypeptide chains, but you eat it.

536
00:36:46,469 --> 00:36:48,130
I mean...

537
00:36:48,304 --> 00:36:50,363
...it tastes good.

538
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,474
- Why do you do that?
- Do what?

539
00:36:52,642 --> 00:36:56,772
Say something super smart
and then bail from it.

540
00:36:58,515 --> 00:36:59,573
Can you keep a secret?

541
00:36:59,749 --> 00:37:01,512
No.

542
00:37:02,485 --> 00:37:04,976
But this time, sure, yeah.

543
00:37:06,122 --> 00:37:12,083
Okay. Well, it was a really
long time ago, but I, too, was...

544
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:14,988
...a nerd.

545
00:37:15,598 --> 00:37:16,622
Too?

546
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,166
When I was a little girl...

547
00:37:19,335 --> 00:37:21,929
...I wore a ponytail, I had glasses...

548
00:37:22,105 --> 00:37:25,802
...and I was totally obsessed
with the science of weather.

549
00:37:28,211 --> 00:37:30,202
Other girls wanted a Barbie.

550
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:34,248
I wanted a Doppler Weather
Radar 2000 Turbo.

551
00:37:34,417 --> 00:37:37,386
But all the kids used to taunt me
with this lame song.

552
00:37:37,554 --> 00:37:38,578
It wasn't even clever.

553
00:37:38,755 --> 00:37:40,689
Four-eyes, four-eyes

554
00:37:40,857 --> 00:37:42,916
You need glasses to see

555
00:37:45,829 --> 00:37:47,319
Go on.

556
00:37:48,164 --> 00:37:49,529
So I got a new look...

557
00:37:49,699 --> 00:37:52,190
...gave up the science-y
smart stuff...

558
00:37:52,368 --> 00:37:54,495
...and I was never
made fun of again.

559
00:37:54,671 --> 00:37:58,698
And I still need these glasses,
but I never wear them.

560
00:37:58,875 --> 00:38:01,366
- I'll bet you look great with glasses on.
- I'm not...

561
00:38:01,544 --> 00:38:03,034
And on they go.

562
00:38:07,016 --> 00:38:08,040
- What?
- Nothing.

563
00:38:08,218 --> 00:38:09,708
Wait.

564
00:38:13,756 --> 00:38:16,054
It's a Jell-O scrunchie.

565
00:38:19,095 --> 00:38:21,928
And now, the reveal.

566
00:38:25,435 --> 00:38:26,459
Wow.

567
00:38:27,704 --> 00:38:30,332
I mean, you were okay before...

568
00:38:30,507 --> 00:38:32,407
...but now...

569
00:38:32,876 --> 00:38:35,037
...you're beautiful.

570
00:38:35,211 --> 00:38:37,907
No, I'm not. I can't go out in public
like this.

571
00:38:38,081 --> 00:38:40,914
Well, why not?

572
00:38:41,084 --> 00:38:44,144
I mean, this is the real you, right?

573
00:38:45,622 --> 00:38:47,180
Smart.

574
00:38:47,357 --> 00:38:49,325
Bespectacled.

575
00:38:49,926 --> 00:38:51,894
Who wouldn't wanna see that?

576
00:38:52,061 --> 00:38:56,657
You know, I've never met anyone
like you, Flint Lockwood.

577
00:38:56,833 --> 00:38:58,596
Me either.

578
00:38:58,768 --> 00:39:00,895
But about you.

579
00:39:17,887 --> 00:39:19,616
Flint, you have a call

580
00:39:19,789 --> 00:39:21,689
Flint, you have a call

581
00:39:21,858 --> 00:39:23,621
Is your phone ringing?

582
00:39:23,793 --> 00:39:26,819
That's weird.
Someone must've changed my ring.

583
00:39:26,996 --> 00:39:29,123
Oh, it's the mayor.
Do you mind if I take this?

584
00:39:29,299 --> 00:39:30,323
No, no, no.

585
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,264
- Go ahead, take it. That's fine.
- I'm sorry. It's important.

586
00:39:33,436 --> 00:39:36,837
- I should be going too. It's getting late.
- I'm just gonna step outside.

587
00:39:47,216 --> 00:39:49,343
Dad, you came.
I have so much to tell you.

588
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:52,545
- Do I look all right?
- You look great. Come on, let's go.

589
00:39:53,923 --> 00:39:55,220
Dad, I almost kissed a girl.

590
00:39:55,391 --> 00:39:58,087
- It's Baby Brent, you know?
- It was the coolest thing... Hi.

591
00:39:58,928 --> 00:40:01,761
- I should be on the list.
- Hey, Brian.

592
00:40:01,931 --> 00:40:07,062
What? You're letting that guy in?
That guy's a nerd.

593
00:40:09,138 --> 00:40:10,969
Hey, how's it going?

594
00:40:11,608 --> 00:40:14,042
Oh, thank you. Thank you so much.
Thank you.

595
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:17,509
A toast.
To Flint and his delicious steaks.

596
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,615
- Oh, thanks. Thank you.
- Very nice place.

597
00:40:20,783 --> 00:40:22,683
Oh, wow. Thank you.

598
00:40:22,852 --> 00:40:25,753
- Flint Lockwood.
- Earl.

599
00:40:31,194 --> 00:40:32,525
So no roof.

600
00:40:32,695 --> 00:40:34,993
Yep. You just hold out your plate.

601
00:40:35,164 --> 00:40:37,155
And I even made it rain
your favorite:

602
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:38,357
Meat.

603
00:40:45,775 --> 00:40:46,799
Okay.

604
00:40:47,477 --> 00:40:50,935
So you know how the grand reopening
of the town is tomorrow?

605
00:40:51,114 --> 00:40:56,347
Well, the mayor has asked me
to cut the ribbon.

606
00:40:56,519 --> 00:40:58,885
He said my invention
saved the town.

607
00:40:59,322 --> 00:41:01,654
Aren't you proud of me?

608
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:11,259
Well...

609
00:41:12,035 --> 00:41:14,333
...doesn't this steak look
a little big to you?

610
00:41:16,439 --> 00:41:21,672
Yeah, it's a big steak. I mean, every
steak is not exactly the same size.

611
00:41:21,844 --> 00:41:24,335
Did you even hear what I just said?

612
00:41:25,715 --> 00:41:27,546
Son, look around.

613
00:41:27,717 --> 00:41:30,242
I'm not sure this is good for people.

614
00:41:31,821 --> 00:41:34,221
Maybe you should think about
turning this thing off.

615
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:37,154
It's making everybody happy.

616
00:41:37,393 --> 00:41:39,258
Everybody except you.

617
00:41:39,929 --> 00:41:42,193
When are you gonna accept
that this is who I am...

618
00:41:42,365 --> 00:41:46,461
...instead of trying to get me to work
in some boring tackle shop?

619
00:41:48,071 --> 00:41:49,663
Well...

620
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:52,707
...you seem like you know
what you're doing, then.

621
00:41:54,677 --> 00:41:57,271
I guess I'll just get out of your way.

622
00:42:25,341 --> 00:42:26,569
Get with the times, man.

623
00:42:26,743 --> 00:42:29,405
I mean, there's no pleasing
that guy.

624
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:33,675
He just wants to take anything good
I do and just smoosh it.

625
00:42:43,459 --> 00:42:45,893
These are big hot dogs.

626
00:42:56,239 --> 00:42:57,763
Man.

627
00:42:58,374 --> 00:43:00,808
I mean, this isn't that bad.

628
00:43:00,977 --> 00:43:02,774
- Is it, Steve?
- Yellow.

629
00:43:02,945 --> 00:43:04,071
You're right, Steve.

630
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,046
The Dangeometer is in the yellow.

631
00:43:07,216 --> 00:43:08,581
I don't know what to do.

632
00:43:08,751 --> 00:43:10,343
I do...

633
00:43:11,087 --> 00:43:13,647
...declare these hot dogs
to be delicious!

634
00:43:14,757 --> 00:43:16,418
Oh, no.

635
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,691
How did you get in here?

636
00:43:18,861 --> 00:43:20,692
Tomorrow's the big day, Flint.

637
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:24,631
The entire town's fate is resting
on your food weather.

638
00:43:24,801 --> 00:43:25,927
I'm thinking pasta.

639
00:43:26,369 --> 00:43:30,829
Some light apps.
I know you won't let us down.

640
00:43:32,942 --> 00:43:35,843
Well, Mr. Mayor, I think there's
something you should see.

641
00:43:36,012 --> 00:43:37,274
What?

642
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,616
This is the molecular structure
of a hot dog that fell last week.

643
00:43:42,185 --> 00:43:46,645
And this is the molecular structure
of a hot dog that fell today.

644
00:43:47,056 --> 00:43:48,819
The machine uses
microwave radiation...

645
00:43:48,991 --> 00:43:51,221
...to mutate the genetic recipe
of the food.

646
00:43:51,394 --> 00:43:54,056
The more we ask it to make,
the more clouds it takes in...

647
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:58,223
...the more radiation it emits, the more
these molecules could over-mutate.

648
00:43:59,235 --> 00:44:01,635
I think that's why the food
is getting bigger.

649
00:44:02,672 --> 00:44:04,469
Here's what I heard:

650
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,835
"Science, science, science, bigger."

651
00:44:07,009 --> 00:44:08,670
And bigger is better.

652
00:44:08,845 --> 00:44:12,440
Everyone's gonna love
these new portion sizes.

653
00:44:13,482 --> 00:44:14,847
I know I do.

654
00:44:17,687 --> 00:44:19,518
My dad thinks I should turn it off.

655
00:44:19,689 --> 00:44:23,921
Geniuses like us are never understood
by their fathers, Flint.

656
00:44:24,093 --> 00:44:25,185
But what if things go...

657
00:44:25,361 --> 00:44:27,591
Who needs the approval
of one family member...

658
00:44:27,763 --> 00:44:30,630
...when you can have it
from millions of acquaintances?

659
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,327
Not to mention that little cutlet,
Sam Sparks.

660
00:44:34,503 --> 00:44:36,061
And me.

661
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:40,300
I've always felt that you were
like a son to me, Flint.

662
00:44:40,476 --> 00:44:45,436
And I'm gonna be so proud of you
tomorrow when you cut that ribbon...

663
00:44:45,615 --> 00:44:47,105
...save the town...

664
00:44:47,283 --> 00:44:51,879
...and prove to everybody
what a great inventor you are.

665
00:44:52,054 --> 00:44:54,579
So here's the cheese:

666
00:44:54,757 --> 00:44:56,725
You can keep it going...

667
00:44:56,893 --> 00:44:58,861
...get everything
you've ever wanted...

668
00:44:59,028 --> 00:45:02,327
...and be the great man
I know you can be.

669
00:45:02,498 --> 00:45:05,262
Or you can turn it off...

670
00:45:05,434 --> 00:45:07,197
...ruin everything...

671
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:11,033
...and no one will ever like you.

672
00:45:11,707 --> 00:45:13,538
It's your choice.

673
00:45:13,709 --> 00:45:15,006
Choice.

674
00:45:15,177 --> 00:45:16,610
Choice.

675
00:45:16,779 --> 00:45:17,803
Choice.

676
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:19,277
Choice.

677
00:45:19,448 --> 00:45:21,348
Choice.

678
00:45:24,086 --> 00:45:25,110
Okay.

679
00:45:36,299 --> 00:45:38,995
I mean, bigger is better...

680
00:45:39,168 --> 00:45:40,192
...right?

681
00:45:40,369 --> 00:45:42,462
Oh, yeah.

682
00:45:46,375 --> 00:45:50,175
Spaghetti. Asparagus. Celery.
Garlic bread. Meatball. Shrimp.

683
00:46:03,592 --> 00:46:05,890
- Looks safe to me.
- And sanitary too.

684
00:46:39,628 --> 00:46:42,791
Who's hungry?

685
00:46:42,965 --> 00:46:47,527
Welcome, tourists,
to Chew And Swallow.

686
00:46:47,703 --> 00:46:49,227
That is one big mayor.

687
00:46:49,405 --> 00:46:52,863
Delight in our nacho-cheese
hot springs.

688
00:46:54,076 --> 00:46:57,102
Allow your kids to eat
all the junk food they want...

689
00:46:57,279 --> 00:47:00,009
...in our completely
unsupervised Kid Zone!

690
00:47:00,182 --> 00:47:02,207
I've got jellybeans for teeth.

691
00:47:02,385 --> 00:47:04,250
And when the fun is done...

692
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:08,356
...gaze upon the sunset
cresting over Mount Leftovers.

693
00:47:08,524 --> 00:47:12,324
From which we're protected
by a presumably indestructible dam.

694
00:47:12,762 --> 00:47:16,562
We've got people here today
from all around the world...

695
00:47:16,732 --> 00:47:18,962
...from as far as China
to West Virginia.

696
00:47:19,135 --> 00:47:21,000
Also I think there's
some Canadians here.

697
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:23,434
- You need to look at this.
- Why aren't you on TV?

698
00:47:23,606 --> 00:47:25,471
You're supposed
to be broadcasting this.

699
00:47:25,641 --> 00:47:27,973
There's a problem.
The food's getting bigger.

700
00:47:28,144 --> 00:47:31,113
I know, it's great. Bigger portion sizes.
Everyone loves it.

701
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,612
I'm not sure we're doing
the right thing here.

702
00:47:33,783 --> 00:47:36,183
What if we've bitten off more
than we can chew?

703
00:47:36,352 --> 00:47:40,288
For the first time in my life, everybody
loves something that I've done.

704
00:47:40,456 --> 00:47:42,651
Why can't you just be
happy for me...

705
00:47:42,825 --> 00:47:45,350
...and go say the weather
or something. Jeez.

706
00:47:45,528 --> 00:47:46,893
And without further ado...

707
00:47:47,063 --> 00:47:50,999
...our town's hero
and my metaphorical son...

708
00:47:51,167 --> 00:47:53,567
...Flint Lockwood.

709
00:47:53,736 --> 00:47:55,067
Yeah, Flint.

710
00:47:55,237 --> 00:47:57,262
Thank you. Thank you, everyone.

711
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,067
- Sign my shrimp.
- Thank you.

712
00:47:59,241 --> 00:48:01,141
- Yeah. Yeah.
- I love you.

713
00:48:01,644 --> 00:48:03,805
I admire your quirkiness, dude.

714
00:48:03,979 --> 00:48:07,608
Brent, we're gonna need you
to hand over the ceremonial scissors.

715
00:48:08,217 --> 00:48:09,684
But...

716
00:48:09,919 --> 00:48:10,943
No.

717
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:14,248
- You can't. You can't take them. No.
- Here you go.

718
00:48:14,990 --> 00:48:17,322
I'm Baby Brent.

719
00:48:19,395 --> 00:48:22,193
Put your clothes back on.

720
00:48:22,798 --> 00:48:25,164
Who am I?

721
00:48:26,936 --> 00:48:29,063
Go ahead, Flint.

722
00:48:29,238 --> 00:48:31,638
Everybody loves you.

723
00:48:31,807 --> 00:48:34,503
Lockwood! Lockwood! Lockwood!

724
00:48:34,677 --> 00:48:37,612
Lockwood! Lockwood! Lockwood!

725
00:49:10,713 --> 00:49:13,773
Danger. Danger. Danger.

726
00:49:17,453 --> 00:49:20,149
Salt-and-pepper wind?

727
00:49:21,924 --> 00:49:23,482
Oregano.

728
00:49:40,075 --> 00:49:43,135
Sam, wait. No, I can turn it off.

729
00:49:48,484 --> 00:49:50,076
I can turn it off.

730
00:50:03,165 --> 00:50:05,690
All right, kid, it's all gonna be okay.

731
00:50:08,404 --> 00:50:10,395
Oh, no.

732
00:50:12,741 --> 00:50:15,369
- Pardon me.
- Pardon me.

733
00:50:16,111 --> 00:50:18,636
- Excuse me.
- No problem.

734
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:23,945
No.

735
00:50:31,393 --> 00:50:33,725
- Gummi Bears.
- Not now, Steve.

736
00:50:40,202 --> 00:50:43,171
Condiments? Salt? Pepper?

737
00:50:45,574 --> 00:50:47,269
Flint.

738
00:50:51,313 --> 00:50:53,645
This is Sam Sparks,
live from Chew And Swallow...

739
00:50:53,816 --> 00:50:55,283
...where a spaghetti twister...

740
00:50:55,451 --> 00:50:59,649
Sam, hey, we love a good storm
over here, but you look like a nerd.

741
00:50:59,822 --> 00:51:04,054
Patrick, several children are stranded
in the path of this tomato tornado.

742
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:05,884
My tummy hurts.

743
00:51:07,763 --> 00:51:09,060
Cal.

744
00:51:10,332 --> 00:51:13,392
What is that, a scrunchie? I haven't
seen one of those since 1995.

745
00:51:13,569 --> 00:51:17,198
What? We have
an actual weather emergency.

746
00:51:17,373 --> 00:51:19,341
Well, we'll get right back
to that storm...

747
00:51:19,508 --> 00:51:22,272
...and hopefully Sam'll look
a little more appealing.

748
00:51:29,952 --> 00:51:33,513
Steve, we just have to upload the kill
code and then we'll shut down the...

749
00:51:33,689 --> 00:51:34,917
What are you doing here?

750
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:37,354
I've been ordering dinner
for the last 10 minutes.

751
00:51:37,526 --> 00:51:39,960
- Is something going on?
- I've gotta stop the machine.

752
00:51:40,129 --> 00:51:42,324
Everyone's in danger
because of me.

753
00:51:42,498 --> 00:51:45,365
Oh, it can't be that bad.

754
00:51:45,701 --> 00:51:48,363
- No.
- Well, I'm out of here.

755
00:51:48,537 --> 00:51:51,005
I can still stop the order
with the kill code.

756
00:51:54,009 --> 00:51:56,705
- Sending kill code.
- I'm back.

757
00:51:56,879 --> 00:51:58,938
Got to get the button.

758
00:52:00,549 --> 00:52:01,641
Play. Fun. Fun. Play.

759
00:52:01,817 --> 00:52:06,447
Hey, Flint. It's been nice
to beet you.

760
00:52:07,256 --> 00:52:09,781
That's a radish.

761
00:52:31,413 --> 00:52:35,782
That was the only way
to communicate with the machine.

762
00:52:36,185 --> 00:52:37,914
What exactly did you order?

763
00:52:38,087 --> 00:52:42,080
A Vegas-style all-you-can-eat buffet.

764
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:47,651
Jellybean. Watermelon.
Marshmallow. Pretzel. Sushi.

765
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:53,894
Cheeseburger. Pretzel. Egg salad.
Strawberry. Marshmallow.

766
00:52:55,838 --> 00:52:57,032
Strawberry.

767
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:04,501
- Is everyone okay?
- Yeah.

768
00:53:11,186 --> 00:53:13,347
Help, somebody.

769
00:53:13,655 --> 00:53:15,589
Help me, please.

770
00:53:15,758 --> 00:53:17,521
It's my son.

771
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,525
We need a doctor.

772
00:53:19,695 --> 00:53:22,528
Is anyone here a doctor? Anyone?

773
00:53:22,698 --> 00:53:24,598
I am a doctor.

774
00:53:24,767 --> 00:53:25,791
You are?

775
00:53:25,968 --> 00:53:28,630
I was, back in Guatemala.

776
00:53:28,804 --> 00:53:30,738
I came here for a better life.

777
00:53:30,906 --> 00:53:32,100
Pretty great decision, eh?

778
00:53:37,279 --> 00:53:38,610
How is he, doc?

779
00:53:40,682 --> 00:53:41,979
He's in a food coma.

780
00:53:43,519 --> 00:53:45,043
Too much junk food.

781
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:46,551
I need a celery, stat.

782
00:53:46,722 --> 00:53:48,451
Here you go.

783
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:55,193
- Daddy?
- Oh, Cal. Cal.

784
00:53:55,364 --> 00:53:57,832
I love you, son.

785
00:54:01,403 --> 00:54:03,462
Looks like everything
turned out okay.

786
00:54:03,639 --> 00:54:04,765
Not yet, it hasn't.

787
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:08,307
That twister was an amuse-bouche
compared to what's on the way.

788
00:54:08,477 --> 00:54:11,002
- What's an amuse-bouche?
- Manny, patch us through.

789
00:54:17,252 --> 00:54:18,412
Go.

790
00:54:18,587 --> 00:54:21,454
Cute report, Nancy.
Hey. Hey. Four-eyes.

791
00:54:21,623 --> 00:54:22,749
Can it, Patrick.

792
00:54:22,925 --> 00:54:26,258
We are about to be in the epicenter
of a perfect food storm.

793
00:54:26,428 --> 00:54:28,589
It's going to spread
across the globe.

794
00:54:29,064 --> 00:54:32,431
I've calculated the Coriolis
acceleration of the storm system.

795
00:54:32,601 --> 00:54:34,660
First, it'll hit New York...

796
00:54:34,837 --> 00:54:36,862
...then Paris...

797
00:54:37,039 --> 00:54:39,940
...then the Jiayuguan Pass
in eastern China.

798
00:54:40,108 --> 00:54:45,910
And in four hours the entire northern
hemisphere will be one big potluck.

799
00:55:11,139 --> 00:55:12,606
Flint?

800
00:55:20,816 --> 00:55:22,147
Flint?

801
00:55:22,317 --> 00:55:23,375
Hey, Dad.

802
00:55:24,086 --> 00:55:25,678
What are you doing?

803
00:55:25,854 --> 00:55:28,516
Well, I tried to help everybody...

804
00:55:28,690 --> 00:55:32,649
...but instead I ruined everything.

805
00:55:33,228 --> 00:55:35,253
I'm just a piece of junk.

806
00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:39,366
So I threw myself away.

807
00:55:39,801 --> 00:55:43,202
Along with all these
dumb inventions.

808
00:55:43,372 --> 00:55:45,237
This is junk.

809
00:55:45,974 --> 00:55:48,067
This is junk.

810
00:55:50,479 --> 00:55:52,071
This is junk.

811
00:55:52,948 --> 00:55:56,782
Oh, son. Listen, when your boat is,
when it's listing...

812
00:55:56,952 --> 00:55:59,420
...and if it's not running,
you know...

813
00:55:59,588 --> 00:56:01,818
Don't worry, Dad, I get it.

814
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:04,458
Mom was wrong about me.

815
00:56:05,527 --> 00:56:07,518
I'm not an inventor.

816
00:56:08,664 --> 00:56:11,098
I should've just quit when you said.

817
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:20,173
Well...

818
00:56:21,076 --> 00:56:24,807
...when it rains, you put on a coat.

819
00:56:25,213 --> 00:56:29,843
Dad, you know I don't understand
fishing metapho...

820
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:32,944
What?

821
00:56:37,059 --> 00:56:38,117
My coat.

822
00:56:48,637 --> 00:56:52,937
Come on, Steve.
We've got diem to carpe.

823
00:56:59,681 --> 00:57:00,943
Kill code downloading.

824
00:57:03,452 --> 00:57:05,818
Redesigning. Virtualizing.

825
00:57:05,988 --> 00:57:07,580
Cutting.

826
00:57:08,256 --> 00:57:10,747
Welding. Forging.

827
00:57:10,926 --> 00:57:12,826
- Wiring.
- Helping.

828
00:57:12,995 --> 00:57:14,622
Testing.

829
00:57:15,831 --> 00:57:17,765
Yes.

830
00:57:21,203 --> 00:57:23,433
Flying Car 2.

831
00:57:23,605 --> 00:57:26,301
Now with wings.

832
00:57:36,852 --> 00:57:39,878
Hey, I had a weird dream
like this once.

833
00:57:40,322 --> 00:57:42,882
I have a macaroni
on my head.

834
00:57:44,226 --> 00:57:45,750
Run.

835
00:57:51,099 --> 00:57:52,225
No school!

836
00:57:57,305 --> 00:58:01,469
Still nothing, nothing in the bottom of
the third inning.

837
00:58:09,384 --> 00:58:10,578
Everyone.

838
00:58:12,654 --> 00:58:14,679
I want to apologize.

839
00:58:16,158 --> 00:58:18,183
Especially to you, Sam.

840
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:20,487
But I have a plan.

841
00:58:20,662 --> 00:58:23,096
This flash drive contains a kill code.

842
00:58:23,265 --> 00:58:26,598
I will fly up into that food storm,
plug it into the machine...

843
00:58:26,768 --> 00:58:28,702
...and shut it down forever...

844
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:31,236
...while you guys evacuate
the island, using brea...

845
00:58:31,406 --> 00:58:33,203
This is all his fault. Get him.

846
00:58:33,375 --> 00:58:34,399
There he is! Get him!

847
00:58:34,576 --> 00:58:35,600
Get Flint.

848
00:58:35,777 --> 00:58:38,871
Let's rock his car back and forth.

849
00:58:43,752 --> 00:58:45,720
Hey!

850
00:58:46,254 --> 00:58:49,155
This mess we're in
is all our faults.

851
00:58:50,625 --> 00:58:53,492
Me, I didn't even protect
my own son.

852
00:58:53,662 --> 00:58:56,130
Look, I'm as mad at Flint as you are.

853
00:58:56,298 --> 00:59:00,632
In fact, when he gets out of that car,
I'm gonna slap him in the face.

854
00:59:00,802 --> 00:59:04,898
I know Flint Lockwood made the food,
but it was made-to-order.

855
00:59:05,073 --> 00:59:07,940
And now it's time for all of us
to pay the bill.

856
00:59:18,553 --> 00:59:20,384
Thank you, Earl.

857
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:23,251
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

858
00:59:23,425 --> 00:59:27,418
- Let's go build some boats.
- Yeah.

859
00:59:27,963 --> 00:59:29,760
I'm gonna go build a boat.

860
00:59:31,366 --> 00:59:32,390
I'm coming with you.

861
00:59:33,335 --> 00:59:36,668
You're gonna need someone
to navigate you through that storm.

862
00:59:37,639 --> 00:59:39,072
I can't let you do this alone.

863
00:59:39,241 --> 00:59:41,971
- Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry.
- Are you kidding?

864
00:59:42,144 --> 00:59:43,975
- Well, I just thought that we...
- No.

865
00:59:44,146 --> 00:59:45,170
Okay.

866
00:59:45,347 --> 00:59:48,111
- You are going to need a copilot.
- You're a pilot too?

867
00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:50,984
Yes. I am also a particle physicist.

868
00:59:51,153 --> 00:59:53,212
- Really?
- No, that was a joke.

869
00:59:53,388 --> 00:59:54,412
I am also a comedian.

870
00:59:56,925 --> 00:59:59,792
- Let's do this thing.
- I'm coming too.

871
00:59:59,961 --> 01:00:02,054
Brent, that's okay.

872
01:00:02,230 --> 01:00:05,324
No, it's not okay.

873
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:09,129
I've been coasting on my fame
since I was a baby.

874
01:00:09,304 --> 01:00:12,205
But it was all just an illusion.

875
01:00:12,374 --> 01:00:16,470
Maybe up there
I'll find out who I really am.

876
01:00:17,212 --> 01:00:19,840
The car's pretty full, so...

877
01:00:20,982 --> 01:00:22,415
Yeah.

878
01:00:22,584 --> 01:00:23,710
Brent.

879
01:00:23,885 --> 01:00:25,614
Okay.

880
01:00:38,166 --> 01:00:39,997
Good luck, son.

881
01:00:47,442 --> 01:00:49,842
Steve.

882
01:00:51,213 --> 01:00:52,544
Pea-soup fog.

883
01:00:52,714 --> 01:00:55,274
Manny, hit the wipers.

884
01:00:58,119 --> 01:01:01,555
There's massive gastro-precipitation
accumulated around the machine.

885
01:01:02,924 --> 01:01:04,789
It's almost as if it's...

886
01:01:05,126 --> 01:01:08,425
Inside a giant meatball.

887
01:01:12,534 --> 01:01:14,661
Water goes in the top...

888
01:01:14,836 --> 01:01:18,738
...a food hurricane
comes out the bottom.

889
01:01:19,174 --> 01:01:21,039
Glad I'm wearing a diaper.

890
01:01:37,759 --> 01:01:39,954
Anybody order pizza?

891
01:01:40,395 --> 01:01:42,420
Hold on.

892
01:01:42,597 --> 01:01:44,531
The pizza's chasing us?

893
01:01:44,699 --> 01:01:46,599
Sentient food? That's impossible.

894
01:01:46,768 --> 01:01:49,703
Unless its molecular structure's
mutated into super food!

895
01:01:49,871 --> 01:01:53,272
That's been genetically engineered
to protect the FLDSMDFR.

896
01:01:53,441 --> 01:01:55,136
Pizza.

897
01:01:55,310 --> 01:01:57,540
Pizza. Pizza. Pizza.

898
01:02:00,615 --> 01:02:04,949
That was close. I mean, can you
imagine if we lost this kill code?

899
01:02:11,559 --> 01:02:12,821
- Tim's Tackle Shop.
- Dad.

900
01:02:12,994 --> 01:02:14,655
You're okay, great.

901
01:02:14,829 --> 01:02:17,354
I need a favor. The fate of the world
depends on it!

902
01:02:17,532 --> 01:02:19,591
Okay, then, skipper.
What do you need?

903
01:02:19,768 --> 01:02:24,000
Go into my lab, get on my computer
and e-mail a file to my cell phone.

904
01:02:31,579 --> 01:02:32,603
All right.

905
01:02:37,986 --> 01:02:39,977
- Want me to drive?
- Yeah, okay.

906
01:02:52,901 --> 01:02:54,869
You're a lot better than me.

907
01:03:01,009 --> 01:03:02,135
Okay, here's the plan:

908
01:03:02,310 --> 01:03:05,108
Sam and I will enter the meateroid
through the intake here...

909
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:07,612
...which should lead us straight
to the FLDSMDFR.

910
01:03:07,782 --> 01:03:10,512
Manny, you and Steve stay on the
plane. Don't spray that.

911
01:03:10,685 --> 01:03:13,745
Once my dad e-mails me the kill code,
we'll destroy the machine...

912
01:03:13,922 --> 01:03:16,220
...and rendezvous
at the western blowhole in...

913
01:03:16,391 --> 01:03:18,916
- How long until the world's destroyed?
- Twenty minutes.

914
01:03:19,094 --> 01:03:20,118
Just before then.

915
01:03:20,295 --> 01:03:23,128
What about me, Brent?
What do I do?

916
01:03:23,698 --> 01:03:27,498
You can be president
of the back seat.

917
01:03:29,304 --> 01:03:30,362
Deploy hatch.

918
01:03:30,538 --> 01:03:33,735
Car upside down, go.

919
01:03:35,176 --> 01:03:37,007
Ladies first?

920
01:03:37,479 --> 01:03:38,969
No?

921
01:03:39,147 --> 01:03:40,580
All right.

922
01:03:41,683 --> 01:03:43,810
Wait for me.

923
01:03:43,985 --> 01:03:46,010
Great. Okay, I'm good.

924
01:03:48,356 --> 01:03:52,258
As long as we stay on course,
it should be a straight shot to the...

925
01:03:54,462 --> 01:03:56,191
Yeah!

926
01:03:59,567 --> 01:04:01,592
We're a team.

927
01:04:14,249 --> 01:04:16,717
We've landed here
in some kind of exhaust vent.

928
01:04:16,885 --> 01:04:20,787
If we go this way, the Flamidabager
should be right down this air shaft.

929
01:04:20,955 --> 01:04:22,684
Brent, get out of that pie.

930
01:04:22,857 --> 01:04:24,085
What's that?

931
01:04:37,272 --> 01:04:39,035
Oh, boy.

932
01:04:46,081 --> 01:04:48,413
Welcome, Flint.

933
01:04:57,592 --> 01:04:59,617
That's fry oil.

934
01:05:06,267 --> 01:05:07,700
Flint, you have a call.

935
01:05:07,869 --> 01:05:09,097
Flint, you have a...

936
01:05:09,270 --> 01:05:10,794
Dad. Oh, okay, great.

937
01:05:10,972 --> 01:05:13,736
On the screen there's a file
marked "kill code."

938
01:05:13,908 --> 01:05:16,570
- Wha...?
- Move that into my e-mail window...

939
01:05:17,545 --> 01:05:19,809
...type in my name, and press send.

940
01:05:22,283 --> 01:05:23,307
- Window?
- Okay, Dad...

941
01:05:23,485 --> 01:05:26,477
...you see the thing that looks like
a little piece of paper?

942
01:05:26,654 --> 01:05:28,144
Use the mouse to drag it.

943
01:05:28,356 --> 01:05:30,324
- Drag it? Drag it.
- Drag it. Drag it.

944
01:05:30,525 --> 01:05:33,016
Right? Okay. Great. Okay, great.

945
01:05:33,194 --> 01:05:34,593
It's not dragging.

946
01:05:34,762 --> 01:05:36,787
Drag it across the desktop.

947
01:05:39,734 --> 01:05:42,862
- That didn't do anything.
- Of course it didn't! You know what?

948
01:05:47,008 --> 01:05:48,032
Go, go, go.

949
01:05:48,209 --> 01:05:50,473
Hoist those sails. Toast that bread.

950
01:05:50,879 --> 01:05:52,676
We are running out of time.

951
01:05:56,351 --> 01:05:58,410
Let's move out. Go, go, go.

952
01:05:58,586 --> 01:06:00,417
We can do it.
Come on, move it, move it.

953
01:06:00,588 --> 01:06:03,921
Good job. That's what I'm talking
about. Everybody head to the docks.

954
01:06:10,865 --> 01:06:12,196
Wait, wait.

955
01:06:12,367 --> 01:06:14,835
I have an important announcement.

956
01:06:16,404 --> 01:06:17,701
See you, suckers.

957
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:19,905
Bon voyage.

958
01:06:20,775 --> 01:06:23,573
And bon appétit.

959
01:06:31,553 --> 01:06:33,987
- Cal.
- Calvin.

960
01:06:43,464 --> 01:06:45,091
Cal, get back here.

961
01:06:51,439 --> 01:06:54,067
- Foodalanche.
- Cal.

962
01:06:54,242 --> 01:06:55,903
I'm not gonna lose you again.

963
01:06:56,077 --> 01:06:57,806
Baby.

964
01:07:02,250 --> 01:07:04,445
Hold on tight, Calvin.

965
01:07:37,118 --> 01:07:41,145
Everybody head south.
We gotta stay ahead of that storm.

966
01:07:44,225 --> 01:07:45,817
- Now what?
- Just click "send."

967
01:07:45,994 --> 01:07:48,428
Flint, the Fliminadifiserser's
right down there!

968
01:07:48,630 --> 01:07:51,929
- Dad, hurry.
- Send. Send.

969
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:53,465
Oh, wait.

970
01:07:56,671 --> 01:07:58,639
Dad? Dad? Can you hear me?

971
01:07:59,207 --> 01:08:00,868
Dad?

972
01:08:01,409 --> 01:08:02,603
Hey, guys?

973
01:08:07,849 --> 01:08:10,682
Holy crap balls.

974
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:12,882
Go, go, go.

975
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:21,528
I don't know.
I think they're kind of cute.

976
01:08:21,696 --> 01:08:23,960
I mean, this one just walked
right up to me and...

977
01:08:24,132 --> 01:08:25,656
He's got me!

978
01:08:27,602 --> 01:08:29,263
- They ate Brent.
- They ate Brent.

979
01:08:30,405 --> 01:08:34,341
Dad, I'm surrounded
by man-eating chickens right now.

980
01:08:35,410 --> 01:08:36,707
So if this is goodbye...

981
01:08:38,146 --> 01:08:40,512
...thanks for trying
to set me straight.

982
01:08:41,049 --> 01:08:43,643
Figured it out a little late, I guess.

983
01:08:44,652 --> 01:08:46,244
Okay, bye.

984
01:09:04,439 --> 01:09:06,031
Dad.

985
01:09:07,742 --> 01:09:10,472
Hey, give me that phone back.

986
01:09:28,629 --> 01:09:29,823
Baby Brent?

987
01:09:29,997 --> 01:09:33,023
I'm not Baby Brent anymore.

988
01:09:33,201 --> 01:09:35,999
I'm Chicken Brent.

989
01:09:36,170 --> 01:09:40,106
And I'm finally contributing
to society.

990
01:09:40,274 --> 01:09:42,105
Crotch kick.

991
01:09:48,182 --> 01:09:52,414
Now go, you crazy kids,
and save the world.

992
01:09:52,587 --> 01:09:55,249
You did it, Chicken Brent.
You really did it.

993
01:09:55,423 --> 01:09:57,391
Go, go, go.

994
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:01,551
It should be right down this hole.

995
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:05,055
That's peanut brittle.

996
01:10:06,868 --> 01:10:10,304
If either one of us touches it,
we'll go into anaphylactic shock.

997
01:10:10,772 --> 01:10:13,206
Actually, I'm not entirely allergic
to peanuts.

998
01:10:13,374 --> 01:10:17,071
I might have just said that
to get you to like me.

999
01:10:17,245 --> 01:10:21,409
So you really thought having allergies
would make you more attractive?

1000
01:10:24,952 --> 01:10:26,817
Mustache.

1001
01:10:26,988 --> 01:10:28,615
Mus...

1002
01:10:37,064 --> 01:10:39,555
- Sesame bagel.
- Hey, taxi.

1003
01:10:39,734 --> 01:10:41,565
- Taxi.
- Taxi.

1004
01:10:41,736 --> 01:10:44,398
I asked for extra mustard.

1005
01:10:50,378 --> 01:10:52,846
I was right.

1006
01:11:02,190 --> 01:11:03,418
Hot tea?

1007
01:11:03,591 --> 01:11:05,616
Did he say hot tea?

1008
01:11:06,928 --> 01:11:10,557
"You are about to be crushed
by a giant corn."

1009
01:11:10,731 --> 01:11:12,392
Run.

1010
01:11:14,535 --> 01:11:17,436
It looks like the food storm
is following an unusual pattern...

1011
01:11:17,605 --> 01:11:19,937
...of hitting the world's
famous landmarks first...

1012
01:11:20,107 --> 01:11:23,235
...and is now spreading
to the rest of the globe.

1013
01:11:24,879 --> 01:11:25,971
What the what?

1014
01:11:26,147 --> 01:11:28,672
Hurry up, guys.

1015
01:11:28,883 --> 01:11:31,681
After I plug my phone into
the FLDSMDFR and destroy it...

1016
01:11:31,853 --> 01:11:35,619
...I'll tug on the licorice twice
and you'll pull me back up, okay?

1017
01:11:36,023 --> 01:11:37,718
Sounds great.

1018
01:11:48,202 --> 01:11:49,464
Oh, no.

1019
01:11:54,509 --> 01:11:55,874
You got cut, didn't you?

1020
01:11:57,245 --> 01:11:59,008
It's just a scratch.

1021
01:12:00,181 --> 01:12:03,878
Brent, you need to take Sam back to
the plane to get her an allergy shot.

1022
01:12:04,051 --> 01:12:05,211
Just a second.

1023
01:12:05,386 --> 01:12:06,648
What? No.

1024
01:12:07,121 --> 01:12:10,181
- Let go, Sam.
- I'm not gonna let you go.

1025
01:12:10,358 --> 01:12:13,225
Flint, you'll be stuck down there.

1026
01:12:13,394 --> 01:12:15,555
It's not ideal, no.

1027
01:12:16,163 --> 01:12:18,563
Come with us. We'll start over.

1028
01:12:18,733 --> 01:12:22,169
We'll live underground.
Use bacon for clothes.

1029
01:12:22,336 --> 01:12:24,099
Sam, that's not a very good plan.

1030
01:12:24,272 --> 01:12:26,900
It is if it means
I don't have to lose you.

1031
01:12:27,675 --> 01:12:30,007
Look, I like you, okay?

1032
01:12:31,479 --> 01:12:34,209
Like... Like, as a friend?

1033
01:12:34,382 --> 01:12:36,179
No.

1034
01:12:36,384 --> 01:12:39,046
Like, "like you" like you.

1035
01:12:41,756 --> 01:12:43,451
Me too.

1036
01:12:45,126 --> 01:12:47,117
But about you.

1037
01:12:52,533 --> 01:12:53,591
Goodbye, Sam.

1038
01:12:53,768 --> 01:12:56,293
Flint. No.

1039
01:12:56,470 --> 01:12:57,732
Hang on, Sam.

1040
01:12:57,905 --> 01:13:00,806
Dr. Manny's got the medicine
for your face.

1041
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:07,941
Pickles.

1042
01:13:09,417 --> 01:13:10,611
Beets.

1043
01:13:10,785 --> 01:13:13,185
Banana.

1044
01:13:13,354 --> 01:13:16,050
Strawberry.

1045
01:13:27,335 --> 01:13:30,304
- Manny, we're on our way. Hurry.
- Hang on, Sam.

1046
01:13:30,471 --> 01:13:32,837
I'm circling the blowhole.

1047
01:13:36,744 --> 01:13:37,768
Scared.

1048
01:13:48,923 --> 01:13:49,947
Gummi Bears.

1049
01:13:50,124 --> 01:13:52,615
Play with us, play with us.
Eat us, eat us.

1050
01:13:53,761 --> 01:13:55,126
Hungry.

1051
01:13:55,896 --> 01:13:59,093
Hungry. Gummi Bears. Gummi Bears.
Gummi Bears. Steve hungry. Hungry.

1052
01:13:59,266 --> 01:14:01,325
Steve starving. Hungry.
Hungry. Starving.

1053
01:14:08,042 --> 01:14:10,203
Manny. Where are you?

1054
01:14:34,101 --> 01:14:36,228
- She touched a peanut or something.
- Oh, boy.

1055
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:48,038
Corn.

1056
01:15:22,650 --> 01:15:23,674
Grabbing.

1057
01:15:24,218 --> 01:15:26,186
Tying. Throwing.

1058
01:15:29,156 --> 01:15:30,953
Waiting.

1059
01:15:33,027 --> 01:15:34,051
Swinging.

1060
01:15:43,270 --> 01:15:46,137
Sorry, old friend.
The kitchen's closed.

1061
01:15:50,845 --> 01:15:51,869
Fight the power!

1062
01:15:52,279 --> 01:15:53,371
Dad.

1063
01:15:53,547 --> 01:15:54,741
No.

1064
01:16:35,756 --> 01:16:40,125
When it rains, you put on a coat...

1065
01:16:40,294 --> 01:16:42,319
...of Spray-On Shoes.

1066
01:16:44,665 --> 01:16:47,327
Yeah.

1067
01:17:02,183 --> 01:17:04,845
Just... There were chickens...

1068
01:17:05,019 --> 01:17:06,111
Where's Flint?

1069
01:17:09,790 --> 01:17:11,417
No!

1070
01:17:12,059 --> 01:17:13,754
I know, kid.

1071
01:17:13,928 --> 01:17:15,190
I know.

1072
01:17:24,405 --> 01:17:26,669
- Cool.
- Yeah. All right.

1073
01:18:04,445 --> 01:18:05,776
Flint?

1074
01:18:08,949 --> 01:18:10,348
I'm sorry.

1075
01:18:28,769 --> 01:18:31,499
Your son was a great man.

1076
01:18:56,730 --> 01:18:59,494
- Steve.
- Steve.

1077
01:18:59,667 --> 01:19:01,328
- Flint.
- Brent.

1078
01:19:01,502 --> 01:19:03,060
- Flint.
- Cal.

1079
01:19:03,237 --> 01:19:04,329
- Steve.
- Flint.

1080
01:19:04,505 --> 01:19:05,733
- Earl.
- Flint.

1081
01:19:05,906 --> 01:19:08,238
- You guy.
- Steve.

1082
01:19:10,611 --> 01:19:11,839
Sam.

1083
01:19:12,012 --> 01:19:13,172
Flint.

1084
01:19:14,148 --> 01:19:15,240
Sam.

1085
01:19:15,416 --> 01:19:17,111
- Flint.
- Flint.

1086
01:19:17,284 --> 01:19:18,615
- Dad.
- Steve.

1087
01:19:18,786 --> 01:19:20,583
Flint.

1088
01:19:24,425 --> 01:19:28,384
Look, when you...
When you cast your line...

1089
01:19:28,562 --> 01:19:32,362
...if it's not straight...

1090
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:35,295
Oh, for crying out loud.

1091
01:19:39,139 --> 01:19:41,004
I'm proud of you, Flint.

1092
01:19:41,575 --> 01:19:44,203
I'm amazed that someone
as ordinary as me...

1093
01:19:44,378 --> 01:19:48,439
...could be the father of someone
as extraordinary as you.

1094
01:19:48,615 --> 01:19:51,914
You're talented,
you're a total original.

1095
01:19:52,086 --> 01:19:54,919
And your lab is breathtaking.

1096
01:19:55,089 --> 01:19:58,081
Your mom, she always knew
you were going to be special.

1097
01:19:58,258 --> 01:20:01,352
And if she were alive today,
she'd tell us both:

1098
01:20:01,528 --> 01:20:03,689
"I told you so."

1099
01:20:04,631 --> 01:20:07,725
Now, look,
when I take this thing off...

1100
01:20:07,901 --> 01:20:11,359
...and you hear me
make a fishing metaphor...

1101
01:20:12,139 --> 01:20:15,040
...just know
that fishing metaphor means:

1102
01:20:15,209 --> 01:20:17,040
I love my son.

1103
01:20:17,211 --> 01:20:19,509
I love you too, Dad.

1104
01:20:30,591 --> 01:20:32,456
So where were we?

1105
01:20:32,626 --> 01:20:34,423
You were about to kiss me.

1106
01:20:34,595 --> 01:20:36,620
Were you gonna kiss me back?

1107
01:20:36,797 --> 01:20:38,287
Why don't you find out?

1108
01:20:38,465 --> 01:20:41,366
Because I don't want to go for it and
then get shut down again.

1109
01:20:41,535 --> 01:20:43,298
- Just kiss me.
- You know...

1110
01:20:53,247 --> 01:20:56,444
Yeah. I'm a chicken.

1111
01:21:14,401 --> 01:21:18,201
This was not well thought out.

1112
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,201
