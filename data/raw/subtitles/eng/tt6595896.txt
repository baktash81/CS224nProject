1
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:19,431
Yes, this battle of
the pokemon league finals is

2
00:00:19,473 --> 00:00:21,266
really picking up steam!

3
00:00:25,938 --> 00:00:27,105
Gengar dodges it!

4
00:00:33,904 --> 00:00:35,071
It's night shade!

5
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,075
But blastoise withstands it!

6
00:00:39,243 --> 00:00:41,036
Wait! That was an ice beam!

7
00:00:42,705 --> 00:00:46,166
And gengar is frozen!
What will the trainer do now?

8
00:00:53,007 --> 00:00:55,092
There goes the poke ball...

9
00:00:56,093 --> 00:00:59,513
And the next pokémon up is...
Venusaur!

10
00:01:00,264 --> 00:01:01,598
It's a razor leaf!

11
00:01:07,062 --> 00:01:10,106
But blastoise's hydro pump
scores a direct hit!

12
00:01:18,866 --> 00:01:22,369
Wow! Venusaur's solar beam,
and blastoise's hydro pump...

13
00:01:22,494 --> 00:01:24,120
What power!

14
00:01:24,246 --> 00:01:25,872
Man! Oh, wow! Yes!
Yeah! Get 'em!

15
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,542
This is ash ketchum,
from pallet town.

16
00:01:28,626 --> 00:01:30,544
Ash is almost ten years old.

17
00:01:30,586 --> 00:01:34,381
When youngsters with aspirations
to become pokémon trainers turn ten,

18
00:01:34,423 --> 00:01:37,759
they can choose their first
pokemon from professor oak.

19
00:01:37,885 --> 00:01:39,928
They can choose
from bulbasaur...

20
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:43,473
Charmander...And squirtle.
Then, they can begin

21
00:01:43,641 --> 00:01:46,143
their exciting journeys
as pokemon trainers!

22
00:01:52,775 --> 00:01:55,944
Bulbasaur... charmander...

23
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:00,570
Squirtle. .. Here we go.

24
00:02:02,493 --> 00:02:05,496
All right, I choose you!

25
00:02:17,633 --> 00:02:19,801
Ash ketchum,
are you still asleep?

26
00:02:19,927 --> 00:02:22,554
You'll be late getting
to professor oak's lab!

27
00:02:22,638 --> 00:02:25,599
Yeah, right,
professor oak's lab...

28
00:02:29,228 --> 00:02:31,480
Mom, why didn't you
wake me up?!

29
00:02:32,106 --> 00:02:34,306
You said yourself
when you turned ten,

30
00:02:34,316 --> 00:02:35,984
you could wake up
on your own!

31
00:02:49,915 --> 00:02:51,416
Hey professor oak!
I made it. I'm here!

32
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:52,917
Oh. Hello, ash.

33
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:56,546
So, professor oak,
where's my pokémon?!

34
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,299
Ah, so you're the last of
the four young ones

35
00:02:59,341 --> 00:03:01,051
starting out
on theirjourneys today.

36
00:03:02,678 --> 00:03:05,972
I've thought about it a lot and
it took me a really long time,

37
00:03:06,015 --> 00:03:08,517
but I finally decided.
I'm gonna choose squirtle!

38
00:03:08,976 --> 00:03:12,562
I'm afraid squirtle was chosen
by atrainer who wasn't late.

39
00:03:14,732 --> 00:03:18,068
I've got no one
to blame but myself.

40
00:03:18,193 --> 00:03:20,236
Okay, then
I'll choose bulbasaur!

41
00:03:20,446 --> 00:03:23,740
Bulbasaur went with a trainer
who also got here on time.

42
00:03:26,702 --> 00:03:29,871
All right! I mean
i really want charmander!

43
00:03:30,122 --> 00:03:32,624
Being a second late for
a train, or even a pokemon,

44
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:34,167
can be life changing.

45
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,760
Does that mean... I go on
my journey without a pokémon?

46
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:46,012
Well, there is another, but...

47
00:03:46,055 --> 00:03:47,389
Uh, I'll take it!

48
00:03:47,723 --> 00:03:50,267
I think I should warn you
that there is a problem

49
00:03:50,351 --> 00:03:51,435
with this last one...

50
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,188
So what? Since I was late, then
I've got a problem with me, too!

51
00:03:55,356 --> 00:03:56,440
All right...

52
00:03:58,567 --> 00:04:02,195
Awesome! All right then,
you're my pokemon!

53
00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:04,865
Whoa!

54
00:04:20,172 --> 00:04:22,591
This pokémon is called pikachu.

55
00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:25,969
It's so cute!
Looks like I got the best one!

56
00:04:26,095 --> 00:04:26,970
You'll see...

57
00:04:27,096 --> 00:04:30,015
Oh, yeah! Hi, pikachu,
my name's ash ketchum!

58
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,267
You and I are gonna
be best friends!

59
00:04:37,272 --> 00:04:39,399
It's the electric mouse pokemon.

60
00:04:39,525 --> 00:04:41,652
Pikachu can be rather shy,

61
00:04:41,735 --> 00:04:44,446
but quite electrifying
when touched by humans.

62
00:04:46,782 --> 00:04:48,492
Hey, I can take a little zap!

63
00:04:48,951 --> 00:04:49,993
All right then.

64
00:04:50,202 --> 00:04:53,413
If that's how you feel, then
this is pikachu's poke ball.

65
00:04:53,831 --> 00:04:56,083
Thanks a lot, professor!

66
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,501
Ash?

67
00:04:58,127 --> 00:05:00,796
Remember, you were going to
head out on yourjourney

68
00:05:00,838 --> 00:05:03,298
right after getting your pokémon.
For goodness sake!

69
00:05:09,763 --> 00:05:12,348
Here. I packed shirts,
underwear, a towel,

70
00:05:12,433 --> 00:05:14,351
your toothbrush,
and a sleeping bag.

71
00:05:14,726 --> 00:05:16,394
Let's go, pikachu!

72
00:05:18,105 --> 00:05:21,024
Don't pokémon usually
go in their poké balls?

73
00:05:21,567 --> 00:05:24,611
They sure do!
Come on, pikachu, get in!

74
00:05:27,489 --> 00:05:29,365
Get in your poké ball!

75
00:05:32,911 --> 00:05:33,828
Oh, right.

76
00:05:33,954 --> 00:05:37,040
This pikachu hates getting
into any sort of poké ball.

77
00:05:37,082 --> 00:05:38,833
Whoa, it does?

78
00:05:39,835 --> 00:05:41,211
Now get in!

79
00:05:50,179 --> 00:05:51,847
Wow! If you're playing catch,

80
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:53,848
then you're good friends already!

81
00:05:53,932 --> 00:05:58,144
Yeah, you're right!
We're best friends already, right?

82
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,703
Pikachu? Are you gonna be
like this the whole way?

83
00:06:18,749 --> 00:06:20,375
Is it because you don't like me?

84
00:06:21,668 --> 00:06:23,586
Well, I like you a lot!

85
00:06:25,255 --> 00:06:27,423
And no matter what,
i want to be your friend.

86
00:06:27,508 --> 00:06:29,760
So we're all done with this.

87
00:06:32,137 --> 00:06:33,263
Now. Put 'er there

88
00:06:36,308 --> 00:06:38,101
you're a handful.

89
00:06:40,938 --> 00:06:43,941
Hey, a pidgey!
That's awesome! Yes!

90
00:06:45,192 --> 00:06:47,235
Catching that pidgey's gonna
be my first step

91
00:06:47,277 --> 00:06:49,112
toward becoming
a pokémon master!

92
00:06:49,154 --> 00:06:50,613
Go, poké ball!

93
00:06:54,243 --> 00:06:54,993
I caught it!

94
00:07:02,918 --> 00:07:06,880
The way to catch 'em is
have a battle. Go, pikachu!

95
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:09,465
Aw, come on,
aren't you gonna help me out?

96
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:12,469
Fine then. I'll do it myself.

97
00:07:20,269 --> 00:07:21,645
It's a spearow!

98
00:07:49,506 --> 00:07:51,174
Let's get out of here, quick!

99
00:08:04,354 --> 00:08:05,271
Knock it off!

100
00:08:05,355 --> 00:08:08,441
I'm the one who threw the rock!
You should be attacking me!

101
00:08:39,514 --> 00:08:41,390
Are you all right, pikachu?

102
00:08:52,361 --> 00:08:55,947
Pikachu! You're gonna be just fine!
Hang in there!

103
00:09:15,467 --> 00:09:16,759
Pikachu!

104
00:09:20,722 --> 00:09:22,181
No, pikachu.

105
00:09:23,308 --> 00:09:24,934
This can't be happening, right?

106
00:09:34,403 --> 00:09:36,780
Pikachu! You've gotta go inside!

107
00:09:38,448 --> 00:09:41,534
I know you can't stand going inside
your poké ball, but still...

108
00:09:41,785 --> 00:09:43,787
In there, you'll be protected!

109
00:09:43,912 --> 00:09:46,456
So come on...
Get inside, please?

110
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:50,126
Then leave the rest to me.
I'll take care of this!

111
00:09:55,632 --> 00:09:56,841
All right, you!

112
00:09:56,967 --> 00:09:59,177
I don't think you know who
you're dealing with!

113
00:09:59,261 --> 00:10:01,263
But I'm ash ketchum,
from pallet town!

114
00:10:01,513 --> 00:10:04,641
And I'm gonna be
the world's greatest pokemon master!

115
00:10:04,766 --> 00:10:06,893
Mess with me and
you're gonna lose!

116
00:10:06,977 --> 00:10:09,437
I'm gonna catch all of
you pokémon at once!

117
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:15,151
Pikachu, you've gotta get
inside your poké ball now!

118
00:10:15,569 --> 00:10:17,862
All right, you,
hit me with your best shot!

119
00:11:04,826 --> 00:11:05,952
Pikachu...

120
00:11:13,585 --> 00:11:14,794
You'll stay?

121
00:11:15,545 --> 00:11:16,462
Mean it?

122
00:11:42,322 --> 00:11:43,573
What's that?

123
00:12:23,405 --> 00:12:26,699
Pikaohu? Someday we'll both
meet that pokemon!

124
00:15:04,357 --> 00:15:06,609
Pikachu, use quick attack!

125
00:15:07,777 --> 00:15:09,570
Tangela, vine whip!

126
00:15:20,749 --> 00:15:22,625
Tangela is unable to battle!

127
00:15:22,876 --> 00:15:25,545
Thus, the winner is
ash from pallet town!

128
00:15:25,628 --> 00:15:27,546
All right!

129
00:15:28,715 --> 00:15:30,299
Man, you were awesome, pikachu!

130
00:15:31,509 --> 00:15:35,554
Very well. As proof of your victory
at the celadon gym,

131
00:15:35,764 --> 00:15:38,433
and by the authority of
the pokemon league,

132
00:15:38,475 --> 00:15:40,977
I now present you with
the rainbow badge.

133
00:15:41,728 --> 00:15:43,646
I just got a rainbow badge!

134
00:15:45,315 --> 00:15:46,983
How many badges does this make?

135
00:15:47,108 --> 00:15:48,484
It's my third one!

136
00:15:48,985 --> 00:15:50,987
I look forward to you
winning all eight

137
00:15:51,071 --> 00:15:52,864
and entering the pokemon league!

138
00:15:52,947 --> 00:15:54,657
Thanks! I'll do my best!

139
00:16:05,794 --> 00:16:06,836
Oh, hi, mom.

140
00:16:07,295 --> 00:16:10,172
Well, well!
You finally decided to call!

141
00:16:10,298 --> 00:16:11,674
Uh, yeah.

142
00:16:12,467 --> 00:16:15,511
Do you have any idea how many
pokémon centers

143
00:16:15,595 --> 00:16:18,097
I've been leaving messages at
hoping you would be there?!

144
00:16:18,223 --> 00:16:19,933
So what's this big emergency?

145
00:16:20,433 --> 00:16:22,810
If I didn't say it
was a big emergency,

146
00:16:22,852 --> 00:16:24,854
you wouldn't have called back,
would you?!

147
00:16:24,896 --> 00:16:26,188
You're just like your father!

148
00:16:26,272 --> 00:16:29,108
It wouldn't hurt to call me
once in a while, now would it?

149
00:16:29,776 --> 00:16:31,694
Oh! Pikachu! Hi there!

150
00:16:32,987 --> 00:16:35,114
That's all? I'm hanging up.

151
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:36,532
Now you just hold on!

152
00:16:36,616 --> 00:16:38,618
I want to make sure
you're eating right!

153
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,702
I'm eating...

154
00:16:39,744 --> 00:16:42,371
And eat your vegetables!
It's very important!

155
00:16:42,413 --> 00:16:43,872
And what about laundry?

156
00:16:43,915 --> 00:16:46,542
You're not wearing dirty
shirts every day, are you?

157
00:16:47,168 --> 00:16:48,961
Come on, mom!
You worry too much.

158
00:16:51,631 --> 00:16:54,550
You're all set.
Your pokemon's completely healed.

159
00:16:54,634 --> 00:16:56,469
Happy and in perfect health.

160
00:16:56,511 --> 00:16:59,555
I was so worried!
Thank you, nurse joy.

161
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,224
Wanted posters?

162
00:17:01,641 --> 00:17:03,601
Yes, that's team rocket.

163
00:17:04,853 --> 00:17:05,895
Team rocket?

164
00:17:06,354 --> 00:17:07,313
They're awful,

165
00:17:07,355 --> 00:17:09,815
and they go around stealing
other people's pokemon.

166
00:17:09,858 --> 00:17:11,067
The worst of the worst.

167
00:17:11,192 --> 00:17:13,152
Really? I wonder what
that's all about...

168
00:17:13,361 --> 00:17:15,404
She's wondering what
we're all about.

169
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,782
Actions speak louder than words.

170
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,285
All we do is get our paws
on primo pokémon,

171
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:24,413
and they'll know how
magnificently we rock!

172
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:31,375
Excuse me! Nurse joy!
Please help my pokemon!

173
00:17:31,796 --> 00:17:33,422
My vaporeon's been hurt...

174
00:17:33,464 --> 00:17:36,383
Let me see.
It doesn't look good!

175
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:37,969
What happened?

176
00:17:38,094 --> 00:17:39,929
That entei
came out of nowhere...

177
00:17:40,763 --> 00:17:42,681
En '7
tel. I'm sorry. Mom!

178
00:17:42,807 --> 00:17:43,891
- Gotta go!
- Ash! But...

179
00:17:44,726 --> 00:17:46,602
I thought for sure
we could catch it...

180
00:17:47,478 --> 00:17:50,022
Don't worry. It'll be just fine.

181
00:17:52,901 --> 00:17:54,193
Thank you so much!

182
00:17:55,195 --> 00:17:56,446
Did you say entei?

183
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:59,782
Yeah. One of
the legendary pokemon.

184
00:18:00,283 --> 00:18:02,952
They're so rare,
nobody ever sees them!

185
00:18:03,077 --> 00:18:06,872
I tried to catch it, but it was
so overwhelmingly strong...

186
00:18:07,207 --> 00:18:08,875
We were beat in no time,

187
00:18:09,209 --> 00:18:11,961
and after, that it ran
into the forest.

188
00:18:12,545 --> 00:18:13,712
It's probably still close!

189
00:18:14,172 --> 00:18:15,256
I'm gonna catch it!

190
00:18:16,466 --> 00:18:18,176
Let's go, pikachu!

191
00:18:20,011 --> 00:18:23,139
Some big deal!
And they're totally clueless.

192
00:18:26,643 --> 00:18:27,759
I know you!

193
00:18:27,769 --> 00:18:32,269
Entei's on the run!
Ain't we got fun?!

194
00:18:36,611 --> 00:18:37,820
Where are you, entei?

195
00:18:47,956 --> 00:18:49,374
There it is!

196
00:18:57,674 --> 00:18:59,509
Let's go, piplup!

197
00:19:03,513 --> 00:19:05,473
Hold it! I got here first!

198
00:19:05,598 --> 00:19:07,182
I got here first!

199
00:19:14,274 --> 00:19:16,192
Piplup, use bubble beam!

200
00:19:30,248 --> 00:19:31,999
Pikachu, use thunderbolt!

201
00:19:54,981 --> 00:19:56,941
Lucario, aura sphere!

202
00:20:08,161 --> 00:20:10,329
Piplup, bubble beam!

203
00:20:27,555 --> 00:20:29,932
All right! You let it escape!

204
00:20:30,892 --> 00:20:33,519
I totally could've caught it
if you hadn't gotten in the way!

205
00:20:34,312 --> 00:20:35,813
You were in the way!

206
00:20:36,064 --> 00:20:37,263
No, you were!

207
00:20:37,273 --> 00:20:38,732
Wanna see if you can beat me?

208
00:20:38,816 --> 00:20:42,611
Good idea. I'm ash from pallet town!
Let's have a battle...

209
00:20:43,696 --> 00:20:47,241
And I accept! I'm verity
and I'm from twinleaf town!

210
00:20:47,408 --> 00:20:51,370
Hey, dude! Once I Polish off this kid,
you're gonna be next!

211
00:20:51,746 --> 00:20:53,664
I want a battle with you, too!

212
00:20:54,582 --> 00:20:56,792
Hey! What do you mean,
Polish me off?!

213
00:20:57,418 --> 00:21:01,130
I'm sorrel from veilstone city.
I'll take a pass on the battles.

214
00:21:01,381 --> 00:21:02,215
Running away?

215
00:21:02,256 --> 00:21:03,799
Come on! Let's have a battle!

216
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:05,718
Here's a little warning for you.

217
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,678
You're going to feel
the wind soon.

218
00:21:07,762 --> 00:21:09,680
I'd start looking for
shelter from the rain.

219
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:12,808
It's gonna rain?

220
00:21:12,934 --> 00:21:16,228
Before you find shelter, I think
you'd better call your mommy!

221
00:21:16,646 --> 00:21:19,106
Hey! Quit it! Let's do this!

222
00:21:19,273 --> 00:21:20,649
Right with you!

223
00:21:21,275 --> 00:21:22,609
I'll give you the first move!

224
00:21:22,735 --> 00:21:24,486
Quit trying to be a gentleman.

225
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:26,196
You may wind up regretting it!

226
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,490
Now, piplup, use drill peck!

227
00:21:29,909 --> 00:21:32,036
All right, pikachu,
use iron tail!

228
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:37,457
Now, quick attack!

229
00:21:41,671 --> 00:21:43,339
Piplup, are you okay?

230
00:21:44,507 --> 00:21:45,925
Then use hydro pump!

231
00:21:47,552 --> 00:21:48,719
Dodge it...

232
00:22:03,276 --> 00:22:04,318
My piplup!

233
00:22:04,485 --> 00:22:05,611
Here! Let's move!

234
00:22:05,736 --> 00:22:06,528
Right...

235
00:22:14,328 --> 00:22:16,413
Well, I'm here,
so where's entei?

236
00:22:17,748 --> 00:22:18,707
What's that?

237
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:20,543
Entei's coming to check us out!

238
00:22:26,466 --> 00:22:28,801
We're blasting off again!

239
00:22:47,737 --> 00:22:50,573
That rock!
Let's get on top of it!

240
00:23:02,835 --> 00:23:06,755
Onix! Stop it! You're only
gonna hurt yourself this way!

241
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:09,591
Yelling at it is only
going to make it worse!

242
00:23:10,676 --> 00:23:11,426
All right!

243
00:23:18,768 --> 00:23:20,561
Ash! Be careful!

244
00:23:22,188 --> 00:23:23,230
Stop it!

245
00:23:24,398 --> 00:23:25,774
Use whirlpool!

246
00:23:30,029 --> 00:23:31,947
I'm sorry for scaring you, onix!

247
00:23:32,073 --> 00:23:34,241
I wish you'd just
calm down, please!

248
00:23:57,598 --> 00:23:59,600
Onix, I'm sorry!

249
00:24:01,561 --> 00:24:03,938
Piplup, your whirlpool
really saved the day!

250
00:24:05,439 --> 00:24:07,816
Ash, thank you.
I've gotta tell you.

251
00:24:08,276 --> 00:24:11,112
You do some dumb things,
but I'm impressed.

252
00:24:11,612 --> 00:24:12,487
Forget it.

253
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:13,989
Rain!

254
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,324
Just like that kid said!

255
00:24:34,885 --> 00:24:35,927
A charmander!

256
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:38,055
It doesn't look
like it's very happy...

257
00:24:38,139 --> 00:24:40,391
Hey what are you doing out
in the rain like this?

258
00:24:52,528 --> 00:24:54,029
That must be its trainer.

259
00:25:02,163 --> 00:25:04,748
You're still here? Go away!

260
00:25:06,083 --> 00:25:07,918
Hey wait, are you its trainer?

261
00:25:08,169 --> 00:25:09,336
Who's asking?

262
00:25:10,212 --> 00:25:11,213
Answer the question!

263
00:25:11,589 --> 00:25:13,549
What're you worked up about?

264
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:15,926
Yeah. Originally I was.

265
00:25:16,052 --> 00:25:16,927
Originally?

266
00:25:17,011 --> 00:25:18,137
I ditched the weakling.

267
00:25:18,512 --> 00:25:21,056
There are charmander like
that one all over the place.

268
00:25:22,016 --> 00:25:26,395
But then, it just kept following me.
So I told it to wait here.

269
00:25:26,479 --> 00:25:27,938
What an awful thing to say!

270
00:25:28,022 --> 00:25:28,981
Ash is right!

271
00:25:29,023 --> 00:25:31,358
When you've caught a pokémon
and then you tell it to wait,

272
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,568
some of them will
actually wait forever!

273
00:25:34,278 --> 00:25:35,487
So what's the problem?

274
00:25:37,156 --> 00:25:38,407
Hold it!

275
00:25:44,997 --> 00:25:47,365
Only a pokémon's
strength matters.

276
00:25:47,375 --> 00:25:50,044
If it's gonna survive,
it had better grow stronger!

277
00:25:50,461 --> 00:25:51,336
What?!

278
00:25:51,379 --> 00:25:54,757
Wait! Isn't it a trainer's job to help
their pokemon grow strong?!

279
00:25:54,882 --> 00:25:57,634
Nah. And what do you get
for that work anyway?

280
00:25:59,387 --> 00:26:00,930
You get to become friends!

281
00:26:02,556 --> 00:26:03,598
You're too soft.

282
00:26:03,724 --> 00:26:06,601
The only thing friendship
does is make a pokemon weak!

283
00:26:07,895 --> 00:26:09,229
My name's cross.

284
00:26:09,355 --> 00:26:11,690
I'm going to become
the greatest trainer ever.

285
00:26:12,358 --> 00:26:13,776
Hey! Hold it!

286
00:26:19,073 --> 00:26:20,115
Charmander!

287
00:26:20,241 --> 00:26:22,076
Its flame is getting weaker!

288
00:26:22,576 --> 00:26:24,619
And if charmander's flame
goes out then...

289
00:26:27,206 --> 00:26:28,957
Ash, we've got to do something!

290
00:26:29,166 --> 00:26:30,041
Right!

291
00:26:57,027 --> 00:26:59,362
You left it out in the rain!
What were you thinking?!

292
00:26:59,447 --> 00:27:01,323
Calm down.
It isn't ash's fault!

293
00:27:01,449 --> 00:27:04,160
It was in the rain after
its trainer abandoned it!

294
00:27:04,493 --> 00:27:06,453
It would've stayed out
in the rain forever!

295
00:27:12,126 --> 00:27:13,168
Can you help?

296
00:27:13,252 --> 00:27:14,795
That's what I'm trying to do.

297
00:27:18,132 --> 00:27:20,008
No pokémon with that
much loyalty is going

298
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:21,384
to go untreated!

299
00:27:29,852 --> 00:27:32,563
I know it's hard,
but please take this.

300
00:27:35,983 --> 00:27:37,526
That should stabilize you.

301
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:39,445
Now all we do is wait
for it to recover.

302
00:27:40,237 --> 00:27:41,696
Make sure it doesn't get cold.

303
00:27:43,115 --> 00:27:44,199
I'll warm it up!

304
00:27:47,828 --> 00:27:49,996
Don't worry, charmander.
You'll be fine!

305
00:28:03,344 --> 00:28:05,137
How do you feel?
Are you still cold?

306
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,562
Things are looking a lot better.

307
00:28:14,355 --> 00:28:15,939
'Cuz of you. Thanks a lot!

308
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:18,900
You're like nurse joy
at the pokemon center!

309
00:28:19,109 --> 00:28:21,185
I'm hoping to become
a pokémon professor,

310
00:28:21,195 --> 00:28:22,821
and you need medical
training for that.

311
00:28:22,905 --> 00:28:23,822
Wow...

312
00:28:23,864 --> 00:28:26,283
Right now,
I'm traveling all over,

313
00:28:26,325 --> 00:28:28,243
gathering data
on legendary pokemon.

314
00:28:28,953 --> 00:28:31,455
So it's good that you ran
into entei, isn't it?

315
00:28:31,539 --> 00:28:34,875
Of course. It was
a priceless experience.

316
00:28:35,501 --> 00:28:37,920
By the way, why did
you come here, verity?

317
00:28:38,045 --> 00:28:39,588
You're a long way from home.

318
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:45,340
Well... long story.
Hey, ash,why are you here?

319
00:28:45,928 --> 00:28:49,514
Who, me? I wanna be the world's
greatest pokemon master!

320
00:28:49,723 --> 00:28:52,392
Master? Do you mean
the world's best trainer?

321
00:28:52,476 --> 00:28:54,644
Oh, no way!
Much more than that!

322
00:28:58,232 --> 00:28:59,441
It's so cold!

323
00:29:03,195 --> 00:29:04,196
Are you all right?

324
00:29:04,321 --> 00:29:06,197
Sure! That was nothing!

325
00:29:10,327 --> 00:29:11,536
Trying to warm me up?

326
00:29:15,541 --> 00:29:16,792
Thanks, piplup...

327
00:29:17,459 --> 00:29:20,244
As a precaution, you're going back
in your poké ball.

328
00:29:20,254 --> 00:29:22,798
We shouldn't let the pokemon
spend the night out in the cold.

329
00:29:23,591 --> 00:29:25,467
You're right. You, too, piplup.

330
00:29:27,261 --> 00:29:29,388
You know...
I'd like to do that.

331
00:29:29,471 --> 00:29:32,474
But pikachu really can't stand
getting into its poké ball.

332
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:33,725
Right, buddy?

333
00:29:37,187 --> 00:29:39,105
No, you can't!
You'll catch a cold!

334
00:29:39,148 --> 00:29:40,566
It's for the best.

335
00:29:41,775 --> 00:29:42,567
Lucario...

336
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:43,986
Alright, piplup...

337
00:30:22,691 --> 00:30:24,609
Seeing the fearsome
forces of nature...

338
00:30:24,735 --> 00:30:26,403
People and pokemon are the same.

339
00:30:27,821 --> 00:30:28,780
Yeah...

340
00:30:30,157 --> 00:30:33,910
There's a legend,that proclaims
ho-oh gave life to entei.

341
00:30:34,161 --> 00:30:35,162
You mean it?!

342
00:30:41,752 --> 00:30:43,962
You see, around
a hundred and fifty years ago,

343
00:30:44,004 --> 00:30:45,964
there was
a magnificent bell tower.

344
00:30:46,215 --> 00:30:48,759
And this bell tower
made it possible for humans

345
00:30:48,801 --> 00:30:51,053
to actually make
contact with ho-oh.

346
00:30:51,428 --> 00:30:55,140
But lightning struck the tower,
engulfing it in flames.

347
00:30:55,933 --> 00:30:58,310
Suddenly, a great rain came down,

348
00:30:58,352 --> 00:30:59,770
and the flames
were extinguished.

349
00:31:00,604 --> 00:31:04,014
But three nameless pokemon
succumbed to the inferno.

350
00:31:04,024 --> 00:31:06,985
Amidst the destruction,
ho-oh descended and bestowed

351
00:31:07,027 --> 00:31:09,863
life upon them once again,
and they were revived.

352
00:31:10,197 --> 00:31:12,616
They represented
the lightning that struck,

353
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,410
the flame that engulfed,

354
00:31:14,535 --> 00:31:16,620
and the water that
extinguished the tower.

355
00:31:19,581 --> 00:31:22,333
Three natural forces made flesh.

356
00:31:25,462 --> 00:31:29,257
Raikou, entei...And suicune.

357
00:31:29,591 --> 00:31:31,217
Oh, I just love suicune!

358
00:31:31,677 --> 00:31:34,930
And this, is the pokémon who guards
over their existences...

359
00:31:35,723 --> 00:31:36,640
Ho-oh.

360
00:31:38,517 --> 00:31:39,258
You've seen it?

361
00:31:39,268 --> 00:31:41,270
The first day I started out
on my journey!

362
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:42,812
Are you serious?

363
00:31:42,855 --> 00:31:46,441
Yeah! And as soon as I did...
This came floating down!

364
00:31:47,151 --> 00:31:49,069
No way you got the rainbow wing!

365
00:31:50,821 --> 00:31:52,572
What's the rainbow wing?

366
00:31:53,157 --> 00:31:55,742
Few people have ever
even seen ho-oh,

367
00:31:55,784 --> 00:31:58,787
and on rare occasions,
ho-oh is said to bestow a feather

368
00:31:58,829 --> 00:32:00,789
on a human
it particularly likes.

369
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:04,459
Yeah? I guess that must
mean ho-oh likes me! Huh!

370
00:32:04,877 --> 00:32:07,004
But, why would ho-oh do that?

371
00:32:07,421 --> 00:32:09,131
There's a legend
that explains it.

372
00:32:09,506 --> 00:32:12,133
It says there is
a rainbow hero who is led

373
00:32:12,176 --> 00:32:14,511
by the rainbow wing
to seek out ho-oh.

374
00:32:16,513 --> 00:32:17,805
A rainbow hero?

375
00:32:17,973 --> 00:32:20,433
I don't know about any of this,
but it's cool...

376
00:32:20,601 --> 00:32:22,811
Oh. Impressed with yourself, huh?

377
00:32:24,146 --> 00:32:25,313
Oops!

378
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,765
Morning, piplup. Sleep well?

379
00:33:04,353 --> 00:33:06,021
Entei and its friends are gone...

380
00:33:06,063 --> 00:33:06,980
Yeah.

381
00:33:09,858 --> 00:33:12,485
Hey! Charmander!
You feeling better?

382
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,580
Let's see.
Your tail flame looks good.

383
00:33:24,832 --> 00:33:25,499
Yup.

384
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:28,544
That tells me
you are back to feeling fine!

385
00:33:28,627 --> 00:33:29,377
You're good to go.

386
00:33:29,461 --> 00:33:30,712
Isn't that great, charmander?

387
00:33:32,631 --> 00:33:33,548
Hey...

388
00:33:34,842 --> 00:33:35,968
You wanna
come along with us?

389
00:33:37,261 --> 00:33:39,137
I'd like us to
become good friends!

390
00:33:47,688 --> 00:33:48,230
Please?

391
00:33:51,817 --> 00:33:54,319
Great! You really mean it?

392
00:33:58,532 --> 00:33:59,991
Okay, here it goes.

393
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:08,625
I just caught a charmander!

394
00:34:09,835 --> 00:34:12,712
Congratulations, ash.
You too, pikachu.

395
00:34:20,888 --> 00:34:22,180
It's a rainbow!

396
00:34:22,681 --> 00:34:24,349
So beautiful!

397
00:34:24,641 --> 00:34:27,226
They say that ho-oh lives
at the end of the rainbow.

398
00:34:37,613 --> 00:34:41,450
The legend. . .Says the rainbow wing
will guide you.

399
00:34:44,411 --> 00:34:46,246
So, what's over that way?

400
00:34:48,081 --> 00:34:50,458
There are quite a number of
steep mountains over there.

401
00:34:51,084 --> 00:34:52,460
The raizen mountain range.

402
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:57,674
I know!

403
00:34:57,925 --> 00:35:00,636
I'm gonna meet ho-oh
and have a pokémon battle!

404
00:35:04,806 --> 00:35:06,808
I'd love to meet ho-oh, too!

405
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:07,850
So would I!

406
00:35:07,935 --> 00:35:09,519
Then I can determine for myself

407
00:35:09,603 --> 00:35:12,856
whether the legend of
the rainbow hero, is actually true.

408
00:35:13,065 --> 00:35:14,024
C'mon!

409
00:35:15,025 --> 00:35:17,652
We've gotta get moving
and find ho-oh!

410
00:35:18,153 --> 00:35:19,154
Right!

411
00:35:21,657 --> 00:35:22,908
That's music to my ears...

412
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,076
Entei proved too elusive, but...

413
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,661
Catching ho-oh would rule!

414
00:35:26,745 --> 00:35:28,705
We're so cool...

415
00:35:29,957 --> 00:35:30,999
Yee-haaa!

416
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,377
Hah!

417
00:35:44,721 --> 00:35:46,848
A bug type against a bug type!

418
00:35:46,932 --> 00:35:49,684
Yeah! Caterpie, I choose you!

419
00:35:54,856 --> 00:35:56,983
Caterpie, use string shot!

420
00:36:05,075 --> 00:36:06,201
All right!

421
00:36:08,161 --> 00:36:09,203
It's evolving...

422
00:36:12,666 --> 00:36:14,209
It turned into a metapod!

423
00:36:17,879 --> 00:36:19,338
Pinsir's getting away.

424
00:36:20,007 --> 00:36:22,384
That's okay!
This is what counts.

425
00:36:22,551 --> 00:36:24,553
Congratulations, metapod!

426
00:37:31,536 --> 00:37:32,912
Really? Suicune?!

427
00:37:33,205 --> 00:37:34,915
Standing right in front of me.

428
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,125
Man, I wish
i could've been there...

429
00:37:39,252 --> 00:37:40,628
Our eyes met...

430
00:37:40,754 --> 00:37:42,964
And it was like time stopped.

431
00:37:44,007 --> 00:37:45,925
Yeah. We were so connected.

432
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,136
Wow. Must've been nice!

433
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,807
To meet suicune so soon after
seeing entei. Incredible luck.

434
00:37:54,059 --> 00:37:55,602
I think so, too!

435
00:37:55,936 --> 00:37:58,146
I wonder how
my mom would feel about it.

436
00:37:59,606 --> 00:38:03,860
Oh. My mother... she's a famous
pokemon trainer back home.

437
00:38:03,985 --> 00:38:06,487
Nothing I ever do
is good enough for her.

438
00:38:06,571 --> 00:38:09,782
If I'm honest, we haven't
talked since I left.

439
00:38:12,369 --> 00:38:13,495
You know what I think?

440
00:38:13,537 --> 00:38:14,913
I think she would
be proud of you.

441
00:38:14,996 --> 00:38:16,831
He's right!
'Course she would.

442
00:38:19,835 --> 00:38:21,127
Maybe...

443
00:38:21,628 --> 00:38:24,172
Jigglypuff, double slap, go!

444
00:38:26,842 --> 00:38:29,177
Charmander, use flamethrower!

445
00:38:41,064 --> 00:38:44,025
Jigglypuff is unable to battle!
Ash is the winner!

446
00:38:44,109 --> 00:38:45,985
Great work, charmander!

447
00:38:57,164 --> 00:39:00,375
You evolved into charmeleon!
That's awesome!

448
00:39:04,838 --> 00:39:06,881
Nice to meet you! I'm verity.

449
00:39:07,507 --> 00:39:08,758
I'm sorrel.

450
00:39:09,509 --> 00:39:12,386
I hope ash hasn't been
causing you too much trouble.

451
00:39:12,429 --> 00:39:16,057
Oh, well! He's rambunctious,
but he's got a big heart.

452
00:39:16,141 --> 00:39:17,725
I hope you'll all
be good friends!

453
00:39:18,226 --> 00:39:20,186
Mom, I wish
you'd stop worrying...

454
00:39:31,615 --> 00:39:33,241
Sorrel? You find anything?

455
00:39:33,617 --> 00:39:37,037
Yes, this is an excellent book.
So well researched.

456
00:39:37,704 --> 00:39:38,621
Listen!

457
00:39:39,789 --> 00:39:40,998
From high above,

458
00:39:41,041 --> 00:39:44,169
ho-oh watched over the many works
of people and of pokemon,

459
00:39:44,211 --> 00:39:46,504
and they experienced
the aura of happiness.

460
00:39:46,546 --> 00:39:48,297
And they received
energy from it.

461
00:39:50,175 --> 00:39:53,595
And yet, the heart of evil
stole strength from it.

462
00:39:57,182 --> 00:39:58,224
What's that?

463
00:39:58,767 --> 00:40:01,895
When the rainbow wing
touches the heart of evil,

464
00:40:01,937 --> 00:40:03,271
its color vanishes.

465
00:40:05,106 --> 00:40:06,398
The heart of evil?

466
00:40:06,525 --> 00:40:08,276
Its color vanishes?

467
00:40:10,195 --> 00:40:11,946
Looks like mine's just fine.

468
00:40:12,572 --> 00:40:15,491
Like your mom said, you may
be a little rambunctious,

469
00:40:15,575 --> 00:40:17,868
but you sure don't
have an evil heart.

470
00:40:17,911 --> 00:40:21,497
That's right! 'Cause I'm big-hearted
and rambunctious!

471
00:40:23,083 --> 00:40:24,000
Knock it off!

472
00:40:24,417 --> 00:40:26,752
That's not nice! Quit laughing!

473
00:40:33,468 --> 00:40:35,136
Pikachu, use iron tail!

474
00:40:42,894 --> 00:40:44,478
Pikachu, use thunderbolt!

475
00:40:53,613 --> 00:40:57,158
Snorlax is unable to battle!
Ash is the winner!

476
00:40:59,369 --> 00:41:00,203
All right!

477
00:41:00,287 --> 00:41:01,496
Very nice!

478
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:05,041
So, since ash was victorious,
who is his next challenger?

479
00:41:05,208 --> 00:41:06,167
What do you say, pidwp?

480
00:41:06,876 --> 00:41:07,793
Lam!

481
00:41:14,467 --> 00:41:15,676
It's cross!

482
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:17,846
So he's the trainer
you were talking about...

483
00:41:19,139 --> 00:41:20,265
I heard a rumor,

484
00:41:20,307 --> 00:41:22,934
you started working with
that useless charmander.

485
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:25,687
There's no such thing
as a useless pokemon!

486
00:41:26,146 --> 00:41:27,814
Charmeleon, let's go!

487
00:41:31,901 --> 00:41:34,945
It actually evolved?
It doesn't matter.

488
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:37,282
A weakling is still a weakling!

489
00:41:37,907 --> 00:41:39,074
You're not even close!

490
00:41:39,576 --> 00:41:42,120
When a pokémon works with
a trainer, it gets stronger!

491
00:41:43,747 --> 00:41:48,247
All right, my strong fire-type
pokémon, lncineroar, to arms!

492
00:41:54,716 --> 00:41:55,717
Look at that...

493
00:41:56,009 --> 00:41:57,260
An lncineroar.

494
00:41:59,095 --> 00:42:00,221
Now come at me!

495
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,973
Charmeleon, use flamethrower!

496
00:42:08,396 --> 00:42:09,188
That's it!

497
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:13,526
Use slash!

498
00:42:20,367 --> 00:42:21,076
Yes!

499
00:42:25,163 --> 00:42:26,122
That's odd...

500
00:42:27,666 --> 00:42:30,794
Keep it up, charmeleon!
Seismic toss, now!

501
00:42:50,313 --> 00:42:51,939
Incineroar? Let's do it.

502
00:42:54,609 --> 00:42:56,652
Charmeleon, use flamethrower!

503
00:42:57,654 --> 00:42:59,280
And we'll use flamethrower, too!

504
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:10,457
Charmeleon!

505
00:43:13,044 --> 00:43:13,878
Of course.

506
00:43:15,505 --> 00:43:17,298
When lncineroar takes
enough damage,

507
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:18,966
it gains more power.

508
00:43:19,926 --> 00:43:21,010
But that means...

509
00:43:21,261 --> 00:43:23,096
It took the attacks on purpose.

510
00:43:24,097 --> 00:43:26,224
Charmeleon, use flamethrower!

511
00:43:29,602 --> 00:43:30,811
It can't keep up!

512
00:43:30,854 --> 00:43:33,147
Its newly-evolved
powers aren't ready!

513
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:35,983
Ash shouldn't be relying
on strength alone...

514
00:43:36,151 --> 00:43:37,652
Use fire fangs!

515
00:43:44,951 --> 00:43:46,118
Use throat chop!

516
00:44:02,927 --> 00:44:05,262
Let's wrap it up.
Use cross chop!

517
00:44:05,972 --> 00:44:08,516
We're not gonna lose this!
Use flamethrower!

518
00:44:09,809 --> 00:44:11,018
No, ash, you can't!

519
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,202
Charmeleon!

520
00:44:31,498 --> 00:44:35,210
Charmeleon is unable to battle!
The winner is lncineroar!

521
00:44:39,506 --> 00:44:40,840
You're too soft!

522
00:44:41,966 --> 00:44:43,842
You battled using cheap friendship,

523
00:44:43,885 --> 00:44:47,346
and called moves your pokémon
couldn't use, so you lost.

524
00:44:47,388 --> 00:44:50,307
You're the worst trainer
I've ever seen and...

525
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:52,101
You'll never win!

526
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:01,569
Your pokemon are
fully recovered and healthy.

527
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:03,071
Thanks very much.

528
00:45:04,489 --> 00:45:06,032
Cheer up, charmeleon's fine!

529
00:45:15,542 --> 00:45:18,670
That guy...
His training is totally wrong!

530
00:45:18,795 --> 00:45:21,088
I know I should have
won that thing, but...

531
00:45:23,508 --> 00:45:26,427
Try as you might, you cannot
deny his convictions.

532
00:45:26,553 --> 00:45:28,513
He and incineroar
are bonded together

533
00:45:28,555 --> 00:45:30,932
through their shared belief
in pure, raw strength.

534
00:45:32,725 --> 00:45:35,102
Even so, it's wrong for
a guy like that to win!

535
00:45:35,562 --> 00:45:38,356
Your first step needs to
be accepting that you lost.

536
00:45:38,398 --> 00:45:40,608
Can't you channel
the frustration of losing,

537
00:45:40,733 --> 00:45:43,444
into working hard,
so that you'll win next time?

538
00:45:43,736 --> 00:45:45,571
Yeah, I hear you.

539
00:45:46,781 --> 00:45:48,449
You know?

540
00:45:51,703 --> 00:45:53,579
Pikachu would've
won that thing.

541
00:45:53,913 --> 00:45:55,205
Ash, you shouldn't say that!

542
00:45:55,248 --> 00:45:57,124
What if charmeleon
had heard you?!

543
00:46:01,671 --> 00:46:03,422
If winning's all
you care about...

544
00:46:03,464 --> 00:46:04,965
Then you're no
different from cross.

545
00:46:09,262 --> 00:46:10,471
- Ash, wait!
- Hold on!

546
00:46:10,555 --> 00:46:12,139
Ash, come back!

547
00:46:21,774 --> 00:46:23,984
What's with those two
thinking they're so smart?

548
00:46:26,154 --> 00:46:28,239
Hey, I'm right,
don't you think?!

549
00:46:29,324 --> 00:46:30,908
So you're saying
it's my fault, huh?!

550
00:46:34,871 --> 00:46:36,914
Even pikachu... man...

551
00:46:48,009 --> 00:46:51,137
If only my first pokémon had
been a squirtle or a bulbasaur.

552
00:47:32,345 --> 00:47:33,804
Pikachu...

553
00:47:43,272 --> 00:47:46,900
Ho-oh, I thought
i was the rainbow hero.

554
00:47:49,821 --> 00:47:51,489
Who needs pikachu anyway?

555
00:47:52,031 --> 00:47:54,742
I'm just fine... all by myself!

556
00:48:20,268 --> 00:48:22,228
Ash ketchum,
are you still asleep?

557
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:24,647
You'll be late getting
to professor oak's class!

558
00:48:24,772 --> 00:48:26,690
Yeah, right...

559
00:48:27,942 --> 00:48:30,027
Mom, why didn't you wake me up?!

560
00:48:39,746 --> 00:48:41,164
Professor oak!

561
00:48:41,873 --> 00:48:43,541
Oh, if it isn't ash...

562
00:48:43,624 --> 00:48:45,000
Am I on time?

563
00:48:45,376 --> 00:48:47,628
There are four students
who came to school late,

564
00:48:47,712 --> 00:48:49,463
and you were
the latest of them all.

565
00:48:53,259 --> 00:48:54,593
Ash, you're late!

566
00:48:55,428 --> 00:48:56,804
I overslept a little.

567
00:48:56,888 --> 00:48:58,139
Where's your homework?

568
00:48:58,181 --> 00:48:59,307
Aw, I forgot it!

569
00:48:59,432 --> 00:49:00,766
What were you thinking?!

570
00:49:08,274 --> 00:49:09,441
Ash, what is it?

571
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:11,401
Uh... it's nothing.

572
00:49:11,819 --> 00:49:12,861
You're weird.

573
00:49:13,154 --> 00:49:15,865
The subject of today's class
is rainbows.

574
00:49:16,157 --> 00:49:20,161
Rainbows are caused by the sun's rays
moving through the atmosphere,

575
00:49:20,286 --> 00:49:22,997
and when they encounter water vapor,

576
00:49:23,122 --> 00:49:26,667
their light is bent and refracted,
causing a multicolored arc.

577
00:49:26,709 --> 00:49:28,752
Children, have you ever...

578
00:49:38,971 --> 00:49:40,472
How long are you
going to stand there?

579
00:49:41,808 --> 00:49:43,476
Aren't you sick
of that view yet?

580
00:49:43,768 --> 00:49:44,894
What's on your mind?

581
00:49:47,396 --> 00:49:50,023
I was just wondering
what's way out there.

582
00:49:50,525 --> 00:49:51,567
Let's see.

583
00:49:51,776 --> 00:49:55,029
There are forests and rivers,
and mountains...

584
00:49:55,321 --> 00:49:57,197
And there's the next town, too.

585
00:49:58,157 --> 00:49:59,324
And past that?

586
00:49:59,367 --> 00:50:02,953
More forests and rivers. . .And
eventually, you get to the sea.

587
00:50:03,329 --> 00:50:04,663
And past that?

588
00:50:05,414 --> 00:50:07,082
I'm sure it's more of the same.

589
00:50:07,834 --> 00:50:09,043
The thing is...

590
00:50:10,211 --> 00:50:12,213
You never know
until you go there.

591
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,216
For me... I wanna see what's out there
with my own eyes.

592
00:50:16,467 --> 00:50:17,509
On a journey?

593
00:50:17,552 --> 00:50:18,636
Sounds like fun.

594
00:50:18,845 --> 00:50:21,305
You don't have to worry
about school and schedules.

595
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:23,172
You can see lots of
new things in places

596
00:50:23,182 --> 00:50:24,474
you never even knew about.

597
00:50:25,601 --> 00:50:27,561
And at night,
i can look at the stars

598
00:50:27,645 --> 00:50:30,397
and talk things over
with friends I'm traveling with...

599
00:50:30,565 --> 00:50:33,526
And as long as my buddy's
with me, I can go anywhere.

600
00:50:33,651 --> 00:50:34,559
Your buddy?

601
00:50:34,569 --> 00:50:35,611
What buddy?

602
00:50:35,862 --> 00:50:37,446
You even have to ask?

603
00:50:37,655 --> 00:50:39,657
My buddy's with me
all the time!

604
00:50:40,741 --> 00:50:42,075
Always...

605
00:50:49,876 --> 00:50:50,751
- Oh, yeah...
- Ash...

606
00:50:50,877 --> 00:50:51,836
You're crying.

607
00:50:52,128 --> 00:50:53,838
<i>L</i> am? So?

608
00:50:54,046 --> 00:50:55,422
So pull yourself together!

609
00:50:55,464 --> 00:50:56,590
What's the matter?

610
00:51:16,110 --> 00:51:17,444
Hey, wait!

611
00:51:29,957 --> 00:51:33,126
Of course! We used to run
like this all the time!

612
00:51:36,088 --> 00:51:39,174
But... but... I can't
remember who you are!

613
00:51:39,425 --> 00:51:41,635
You were my very best friend, but...

614
00:51:48,684 --> 00:51:50,185
Doitt go!

615
00:52:02,198 --> 00:52:03,449
Pikachu!

616
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:21,967
Pikachu!

617
00:52:23,886 --> 00:52:27,014
Pikachu!
It was all my fault!

618
00:52:28,307 --> 00:52:32,185
I'm sorry!
I just... I just...

619
00:52:40,278 --> 00:52:42,196
Look, ash. Here.

620
00:52:43,406 --> 00:52:44,532
Thank you very much.

621
00:52:44,657 --> 00:52:46,909
Do you know how long
we've been looking for you?!

622
00:52:48,828 --> 00:52:50,287
Uh...Sorry.

623
00:52:50,329 --> 00:52:52,914
Do you honestly think
you're going to win every battle?

624
00:52:53,082 --> 00:52:55,042
It's the times we lose
that we truly see

625
00:52:55,126 --> 00:52:56,460
what a trainer's made of.

626
00:52:57,503 --> 00:52:58,670
But that's just my opinion.

627
00:53:04,844 --> 00:53:07,805
Charmeleon. .. I'm sorry.

628
00:53:09,765 --> 00:53:12,058
You forgot that
pokemon even existed?!

629
00:53:13,144 --> 00:53:15,271
That had to have been
the worst dream ever!

630
00:53:15,646 --> 00:53:16,688
But, you know,

631
00:53:16,731 --> 00:53:19,024
it's not impossible for
pokémon to leave us.

632
00:53:22,737 --> 00:53:24,905
When I was young,
my parents were away for work

633
00:53:24,947 --> 00:53:25,864
more than home.

634
00:53:26,198 --> 00:53:28,909
My family had a luxray
who took care of me.

635
00:53:29,076 --> 00:53:30,410
It was always with me.

636
00:53:32,204 --> 00:53:33,246
But then...

637
00:53:33,372 --> 00:53:35,749
There was one awful day
when I went out alone...

638
00:53:58,773 --> 00:54:00,274
Luxray...

639
00:54:22,922 --> 00:54:27,422
Luxray! Luxray! Luxray!

640
00:54:36,811 --> 00:54:37,937
After that...

641
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:41,314
I was afraid to make friends
with pokémon for a very long time.

642
00:54:43,317 --> 00:54:45,694
The only thing that
snapped me out of it...

643
00:54:45,986 --> 00:54:47,445
Was when I met lucario.

644
00:54:49,115 --> 00:54:50,199
Awesome...

645
00:54:59,834 --> 00:55:00,876
What was that?!

646
00:55:01,085 --> 00:55:02,169
A pokémon?

647
00:55:13,597 --> 00:55:14,723
They're primeape!

648
00:55:14,890 --> 00:55:17,309
Once they're angry,
there's no calming them down!

649
00:55:29,196 --> 00:55:30,655
What's going on?!

650
00:55:30,823 --> 00:55:32,032
Ash, we need metapod!

651
00:55:32,908 --> 00:55:33,992
But why?

652
00:55:34,034 --> 00:55:36,953
If we try to fight back,
they'll only get angrier!

653
00:55:37,329 --> 00:55:38,330
Got it!

654
00:55:47,965 --> 00:55:50,050
Metapod! Use string shot!

655
00:55:57,933 --> 00:56:00,185
Come on, primeape,
don't be so mad!

656
00:56:00,728 --> 00:56:02,563
Metapod, you were awesome!

657
00:56:10,696 --> 00:56:12,447
It evolved into a butter-free!

658
00:56:15,117 --> 00:56:16,409
They're after us again!

659
00:56:16,994 --> 00:56:18,787
Butter-free, use sleep powder!

660
00:56:38,891 --> 00:56:40,434
Butterfree, you're the best!

661
00:56:41,977 --> 00:56:43,019
Now's our chance!

662
00:56:47,233 --> 00:56:49,485
Well, lookee what
we have here...

663
00:56:50,861 --> 00:56:52,696
A pack of primo primeape!

664
00:56:52,738 --> 00:56:54,614
And they're all
blissfully asleep.

665
00:56:54,698 --> 00:56:56,700
This is a gotta
catch 'em all moment!

666
00:57:05,417 --> 00:57:08,461
We're blasting off yet again!

667
00:57:17,596 --> 00:57:18,471
A river!

668
00:57:18,556 --> 00:57:19,807
We'll take care of this!

669
00:57:20,266 --> 00:57:22,309
Now, it's your turn, lapras!

670
00:58:06,353 --> 00:58:08,355
Look! That butterfree's
in trouble!

671
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:11,191
Right! Butter-free, I choose you!

672
00:58:25,205 --> 00:58:27,248
Butterfree, now use gust, go!

673
00:58:37,968 --> 00:58:39,010
Awesome!

674
00:58:39,845 --> 00:58:42,389
That butter-free has
different coloring.

675
00:58:42,556 --> 00:58:43,723
It's really cute.

676
00:58:48,145 --> 00:58:49,771
I think that
butterfree's a girl.

677
00:58:49,855 --> 00:58:50,605
That's right.

678
00:58:52,191 --> 00:58:53,025
Yeah?

679
00:59:09,667 --> 00:59:10,459
There!

680
00:59:10,668 --> 00:59:13,671
The source of the rainbow.
The raizen mountains!

681
00:59:26,225 --> 00:59:28,101
That's the highest mountain
in the range.

682
00:59:28,185 --> 00:59:29,144
<i>Mount tense“!</i>

683
00:59:31,188 --> 00:59:32,939
You mean that's
where we're going?

684
00:59:32,981 --> 00:59:33,773
That's right.

685
00:59:34,233 --> 00:59:35,984
Then I'll meet ho-oh real soon!

686
00:59:36,985 --> 00:59:38,277
Pikachu. Let's go!

687
00:59:39,738 --> 00:59:40,488
Ash!

688
00:59:42,282 --> 00:59:43,283
You hear that?

689
00:59:43,325 --> 00:59:44,576
With stereo ears.

690
00:59:44,910 --> 00:59:46,286
We're ho-oh catchers!

691
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:48,288
- Sneaky and snarky!
- Sneaky and snarky!

692
00:59:55,587 --> 00:59:58,131
Oh wow, look at
all the butterfree!

693
01:00:01,385 --> 01:00:03,845
All right...
Time for you to come out!

694
01:00:12,479 --> 01:00:14,481
Isn't that the one
butterfree rescued?

695
01:00:14,565 --> 01:00:15,315
Sure is!

696
01:00:16,817 --> 01:00:19,110
This is the season when
butter-free gather in groups,

697
01:00:19,153 --> 01:00:20,988
and head south to
their spawning grounds.

698
01:00:21,405 --> 01:00:22,406
Whoa...

699
01:00:22,448 --> 01:00:24,408
Look! Your butterfree's
joining in.

700
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:26,326
That's their courtship dance.

701
01:00:32,958 --> 01:00:34,334
I'd say they both agree...

702
01:00:34,376 --> 01:00:35,960
Good for you, butterfree!

703
01:00:36,295 --> 01:00:39,172
But, ash, you know if they
both fly off to the south...

704
01:00:39,381 --> 01:00:41,508
That means goodbye
to butterfree.

705
01:00:49,057 --> 01:00:51,809
But. . .That's. ..
Not what I want to happen.

706
01:00:52,519 --> 01:00:55,146
I mean, butterfree's
one of my good friends!

707
01:00:56,982 --> 01:00:59,234
I don't want to say goodbye.
No way!

708
01:01:00,110 --> 01:01:02,028
Yeah, I hear you.

709
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:04,698
It's your decision,
what do you say?

710
01:01:14,374 --> 01:01:17,001
Hi. So what do you
think you wanna do?

711
01:01:18,462 --> 01:01:20,881
Do you really wanna go with
the rest of the butter-free...

712
01:01:20,964 --> 01:01:22,465
And say goodbye to all of us?

713
01:01:48,367 --> 01:01:49,868
You should go with your friend!

714
01:01:52,704 --> 01:01:55,581
Hurry up! Lf you don't go now,
you'll both get left behind!

715
01:01:55,833 --> 01:01:58,252
You're both...
Really great butter-free,

716
01:01:58,293 --> 01:01:59,669
so take care of each other!

717
01:02:15,185 --> 01:02:16,978
You take good care
of yourselves!

718
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:20,190
Now you two be
careful out there!

719
01:02:27,865 --> 01:02:31,076
Butferfree!
Take care of yourself!

720
01:02:56,018 --> 01:02:57,060
They're gone...

721
01:02:57,227 --> 01:02:58,269
Yeah...

722
01:02:59,938 --> 01:03:02,899
But you know, I'm really
glad I met butter-free.

723
01:03:03,442 --> 01:03:07,154
True, it's not here...
But we'll always be good friends.

724
01:03:10,574 --> 01:03:11,825
One thing's for sure.

725
01:03:12,367 --> 01:03:16,204
Trainers raise pokemon, but
pokemon live their own lives.

726
01:03:24,796 --> 01:03:25,838
It's raikou!

727
01:03:50,948 --> 01:03:53,784
It looks like something's
made the wild pokémon upset.

728
01:03:53,992 --> 01:03:54,701
It does.

729
01:03:54,785 --> 01:03:55,952
It's ho-oh!

730
01:03:56,328 --> 01:03:57,787
All of them gather here!

731
01:03:57,829 --> 01:04:01,833
All of these wild pokemon want
to receive power from ho-oh.

732
01:04:06,421 --> 01:04:08,881
It's faint, but I'm
catching a whiff of ho-oh.

733
01:04:09,383 --> 01:04:10,592
Hey, could it be this?

734
01:04:11,969 --> 01:04:14,638
Wow! It's the rainbow wing!

735
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:15,722
You know of it?

736
01:04:16,014 --> 01:04:17,807
Hey! I know you!

737
01:04:17,849 --> 01:04:20,059
You wrote the book!
What was your name?

738
01:04:20,310 --> 01:04:22,562
Why don't you just
call me bonji?

739
01:04:23,438 --> 01:04:26,441
For the past twenty years,
I've been on a quest,

740
01:04:26,525 --> 01:04:29,110
searching for ho-oh as
part of my research.

741
01:04:29,194 --> 01:04:30,403
Twenty years?

742
01:04:30,696 --> 01:04:33,281
You see, I've pulled
data from many places,

743
01:04:33,365 --> 01:04:36,493
which led me to this mountain
for ho-oh's next appearance.

744
01:04:36,618 --> 01:04:38,161
Then let's all go together!

745
01:04:38,412 --> 01:04:40,914
Yeah we're on our way
to see ho-oh as well.

746
01:04:43,291 --> 01:04:47,086
All right. That shine is
the shine of youth.

747
01:04:47,879 --> 01:04:49,255
How I missed it.

748
01:04:49,381 --> 01:04:53,009
It's almost too beautiful
for me to look upon.

749
01:04:53,802 --> 01:04:57,347
It's probably thanks in large part
to the rainbow wing...

750
01:04:57,389 --> 01:05:00,809
That you were able to come across
entei, suicune, and raikou.

751
01:05:02,561 --> 01:05:05,438
Ho-oh wants to know if there
is a young person out there

752
01:05:05,522 --> 01:05:07,273
suited to be the rainbow hero.

753
01:05:07,566 --> 01:05:08,525
You mean me?

754
01:05:08,567 --> 01:05:10,610
That means you may
have someone guiding you.

755
01:05:10,694 --> 01:05:14,197
A guide from the shadows.
Have you noticed anything?

756
01:05:15,073 --> 01:05:18,117
From the shadows?
Wait, yeah there was something...

757
01:05:18,702 --> 01:05:20,328
I wonder if it's still there...

758
01:05:21,038 --> 01:05:25,208
I suspect it's an extremely
rare pokemon. Marshadow.

759
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:25,959
Marshadow?

760
01:05:26,043 --> 01:05:29,254
Yes.They say it's a guide
from the shadows.

761
01:05:29,337 --> 01:05:31,380
When a color of
the rainbow fades,

762
01:05:31,423 --> 01:05:34,259
marshadow seals it back up
and makes it right.

763
01:05:36,762 --> 01:05:37,721
There's the summit...

764
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:39,264
The rainbow wing!

765
01:05:56,073 --> 01:05:59,326
When a rainbow flower
blooms upon rainbow rock,

766
01:05:59,409 --> 01:06:01,202
ho-oh shall appear.

767
01:06:01,286 --> 01:06:03,413
Well, I can't just
stand here waiting!

768
01:06:03,455 --> 01:06:04,789
Let's go, buddy!

769
01:06:05,874 --> 01:06:07,625
Hey, wait for me!

770
01:06:09,586 --> 01:06:12,839
Time flies, and rainbows
quickly vanish.

771
01:06:13,215 --> 01:06:15,258
Yes, young ones. Hurry!

772
01:06:17,928 --> 01:06:20,597
The "young ones" have to hurry!

773
01:06:21,890 --> 01:06:23,975
I'm not feeling
all that young...

774
01:06:24,017 --> 01:06:25,518
Hurrying's for the harried...

775
01:06:27,354 --> 01:06:29,439
- And all on an empty stomach.
- And all on an empty stomach.

776
01:06:40,450 --> 01:06:42,076
That's where you should
place the rainbow wing.

777
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:45,205
I'll do it!

778
01:06:56,716 --> 01:06:58,926
It's cross! What's going on?!

779
01:06:59,344 --> 01:07:00,636
I'll take that!

780
01:07:00,679 --> 01:07:02,972
The trainer who battles ho-oh
is the strongest,

781
01:07:03,014 --> 01:07:04,473
and that trainer is me!

782
01:07:04,516 --> 01:07:05,725
That's not how it works!

783
01:07:05,851 --> 01:07:09,396
Now look! The one who gets to
battle ho-oh is the chosen one!

784
01:07:09,563 --> 01:07:10,522
The rainbow hero!

785
01:07:10,689 --> 01:07:11,856
You're too soft.

786
01:07:11,898 --> 01:07:14,525
Remember might makes right.
And that's it.

787
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:16,278
So, what about the weak then?

788
01:07:16,361 --> 01:07:17,236
They're trash!

789
01:07:17,654 --> 01:07:18,571
And people who lose?

790
01:07:18,613 --> 01:07:19,739
Worse than trash!

791
01:07:20,532 --> 01:07:23,451
There's no way I can
afford to let you win this!

792
01:07:31,710 --> 01:07:32,794
You're marshadow!

793
01:07:34,838 --> 01:07:36,631
That's the pokémon
we saw that night!

794
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:38,424
Marshadow is so cute...

795
01:07:38,466 --> 01:07:40,926
That's the guide
from the shadows? Wow.

796
01:07:45,515 --> 01:07:49,268
Marshadow. .. Its only purpose
is to observe the proceedings.

797
01:07:49,352 --> 01:07:50,144
<i>Bony?</i>

798
01:07:53,773 --> 01:07:55,775
Charmeleon! I choose you!

799
01:08:00,947 --> 01:08:02,365
Use flamethrower!

800
01:08:04,284 --> 01:08:05,535
Charge, charmeleon!

801
01:08:08,330 --> 01:08:09,914
Charmeleon, now use slash!

802
01:08:15,086 --> 01:08:15,961
Perfect!

803
01:08:17,047 --> 01:08:18,298
Throat chop, go!

804
01:08:26,431 --> 01:08:27,557
Use slash again!

805
01:08:33,230 --> 01:08:34,314
Use flamethrower!

806
01:08:36,233 --> 01:08:37,150
Charmeleon!

807
01:09:00,715 --> 01:09:02,216
You evolved into a charizard!

808
01:09:03,468 --> 01:09:04,802
Go charizard!

809
01:09:04,928 --> 01:09:06,054
Aw, who cares?

810
01:09:06,137 --> 01:09:08,848
Even when weak pokemon evolve,
they're still weak!

811
01:09:09,015 --> 01:09:10,307
Now use throat chop!

812
01:09:10,892 --> 01:09:12,435
Charizard, use slash!

813
01:09:19,985 --> 01:09:21,319
Use flamethrower!

814
01:09:28,952 --> 01:09:30,244
Now use dragon rage!

815
01:09:41,172 --> 01:09:43,841
Charizard! We've gotta
wrap this up quick!

816
01:09:43,967 --> 01:09:45,385
Build up your power.

817
01:09:45,427 --> 01:09:47,303
Let's end this one
with a big attack!

818
01:09:48,221 --> 01:09:50,139
All right, fire fang!

819
01:09:53,351 --> 01:09:54,393
Dodge it, quick!

820
01:10:00,108 --> 01:10:01,484
Grab and drag it down!

821
01:10:05,113 --> 01:10:06,197
Use seismic toss!

822
01:10:19,336 --> 01:10:21,504
Incineroar, use flamethrower!

823
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:25,425
Charizard, use flamethrower!

824
01:10:31,890 --> 01:10:33,391
Go!

825
01:10:57,248 --> 01:10:59,083
- Alright!
- You did it, charizard!

826
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:22,273
Ho-oh. ..
I saw ho-oh, too!

827
01:11:24,275 --> 01:11:26,819
But it didn't gift me
with the rainbow wing!

828
01:11:26,945 --> 01:11:28,863
And here
i did everything I could

829
01:11:28,947 --> 01:11:31,157
to become
the strongest trainer of all!

830
01:11:32,826 --> 01:11:34,327
Why must it be you?!

831
01:11:34,411 --> 01:11:36,704
If ho-oh doesn't consider
me the strongest,

832
01:11:36,788 --> 01:11:38,122
I'll just crush ho-oh!

833
01:11:38,164 --> 01:11:39,248
But, cross...

834
01:11:39,833 --> 01:11:41,835
I wanna get stronger, too, you know.

835
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:45,505
But still, I only got this far
with the help of my friends!

836
01:11:45,588 --> 01:11:47,881
So I know it's not
only about strength!

837
01:11:48,216 --> 01:11:50,009
Then what do you
even battle for?!

838
01:11:50,176 --> 01:11:51,594
I do it...

839
01:11:52,470 --> 01:11:54,180
Because I wanna make friends!

840
01:11:55,890 --> 01:11:57,224
Not just with ho-oh!

841
01:11:57,308 --> 01:12:00,185
I wanna make friends with
all kinds of pokémon!

842
01:12:00,437 --> 01:12:01,563
That's why I battle!

843
01:12:12,615 --> 01:12:13,574
Not good!

844
01:12:18,997 --> 01:12:21,124
Now come to me, ho-oh!

845
01:12:39,767 --> 01:12:41,727
You see, the rainbow wing...

846
01:12:41,853 --> 01:12:45,898
Loses its color when touched
by one with an evil heart.

847
01:12:52,489 --> 01:12:53,615
What?!

848
01:13:00,330 --> 01:13:03,416
Marshadow seals it back up,
and makes it right.

849
01:13:07,295 --> 01:13:10,423
I'll pound you down, too!
Lycanroc, use crush claw!

850
01:13:23,561 --> 01:13:24,228
Oh no!

851
01:13:24,270 --> 01:13:26,438
Marshadow's
controlling lycanroc!

852
01:13:26,606 --> 01:13:29,400
It wants to tear people
and pokémon apart!

853
01:13:39,035 --> 01:13:40,161
You just...

854
01:13:40,495 --> 01:13:41,704
Don't you see?!

855
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:45,083
That means it never forgot
you were once its trainer!

856
01:13:45,542 --> 01:13:47,794
That's just like charizard
to be awesome!

857
01:14:09,482 --> 01:14:10,566
Lucaflo!

858
01:14:12,110 --> 01:14:13,653
Pikachu! Use thunderbolt!

859
01:14:21,953 --> 01:14:25,081
It looks like marshadow wants
to control all of you as well!

860
01:14:25,415 --> 01:14:26,332
No way!

861
01:14:26,416 --> 01:14:28,835
Ho-oh will never appear
now that it's come to this!

862
01:14:38,344 --> 01:14:39,511
Is everyone all right?

863
01:14:39,804 --> 01:14:41,180
Yeah... I think so...

864
01:14:44,976 --> 01:14:47,895
Young man, you have got to
get the rainbow wing back.

865
01:14:49,063 --> 01:14:52,900
Marshadow is getting its
power from the rainbow wing!

866
01:14:53,192 --> 01:14:56,403
And there's only person who
can get it back.

867
01:14:56,487 --> 01:14:57,946
That is you!

868
01:15:03,119 --> 01:15:04,286
Then I've gotta do it!

869
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:07,373
We'll do whatever
we can to help out!

870
01:15:07,498 --> 01:15:08,457
All right!

871
01:15:08,583 --> 01:15:09,542
This way!

872
01:15:11,711 --> 01:15:13,379
Charizard, use flamethrower!

873
01:15:19,552 --> 01:15:20,886
Use hydro pump!

874
01:15:48,289 --> 01:15:49,248
No, don't!

875
01:15:52,752 --> 01:15:53,753
<i>Cross).!</i>

876
01:15:55,588 --> 01:15:57,923
I've gotta do this! Go!

877
01:16:02,845 --> 01:16:05,764
You bit me the day we met too,
remember?

878
01:16:06,557 --> 01:16:07,599
Remember?

879
01:16:08,017 --> 01:16:09,935
Lycanroc, remember!

880
01:16:25,952 --> 01:16:27,370
Lycanroc.

881
01:16:28,621 --> 01:16:30,581
Marshadow!
Give me the rainbow wing.

882
01:16:37,046 --> 01:16:38,881
Hit it right back
with iron tail!

883
01:16:47,014 --> 01:16:48,015
Keep it up!

884
01:16:53,604 --> 01:16:54,688
Lucaflo!

885
01:17:05,283 --> 01:17:05,992
<i>Cross).!</i>

886
01:17:22,633 --> 01:17:23,634
Pikachu!

887
01:17:27,555 --> 01:17:28,889
Let's go, buddy!

888
01:17:41,110 --> 01:17:42,152
Dodge it!

889
01:17:46,491 --> 01:17:48,117
Pikachu, use thunderbolt!

890
01:18:23,236 --> 01:18:24,487
Pikachu!

891
01:18:59,230 --> 01:19:00,606
Oh, ash...

892
01:19:20,918 --> 01:19:23,211
Pikachu! Get inside, please?

893
01:19:26,090 --> 01:19:30,590
I know you can't stand going
inside your poké ball, but...

894
01:19:31,095 --> 01:19:32,805
You'll be protected!

895
01:19:42,523 --> 01:19:45,234
Now you look, I don't think
you know who you're dealing with!

896
01:19:45,610 --> 01:19:47,778
I'm ash ketchum,
from pallet town!

897
01:19:47,820 --> 01:19:50,697
And I'm gonna be
the world's

898
01:19:50,781 --> 01:19:52,991
greatest pokemon master!

899
01:19:53,492 --> 01:19:55,660
Mess with me
and you're gonna lose!

900
01:20:22,563 --> 01:20:26,191
Pikachu, why won't you
get in your poké ball?

901
01:20:28,152 --> 01:20:29,862
It's because...

902
01:20:31,656 --> 01:20:32,865
It's because...

903
01:20:32,907 --> 01:20:36,702
I always want...
To be with you...

904
01:20:39,413 --> 01:20:41,206
Pikachu, you...

905
01:22:51,295 --> 01:22:54,673
Pikachu... you guys...
Where are you?

906
01:23:20,866 --> 01:23:22,200
Pikachu!

907
01:23:34,505 --> 01:23:36,381
We used to run like
this all the time!

908
01:24:23,220 --> 01:24:24,471
Pikachu!

909
01:24:45,910 --> 01:24:46,952
Pikachu...

910
01:24:48,329 --> 01:24:49,330
Ash!

911
01:24:49,747 --> 01:24:50,956
You're alright!

912
01:24:51,582 --> 01:24:53,584
Verity! Sorrel!

913
01:25:11,435 --> 01:25:15,105
When a rainbow flower
blooms upon rainbow rock,

914
01:25:15,272 --> 01:25:16,940
ho-oh shall appear.

915
01:25:19,610 --> 01:25:21,695
Yes! Now go, young man!

916
01:26:14,331 --> 01:26:16,916
The one who is guided
by the rainbow wing...

917
01:26:17,001 --> 01:26:20,713
May meet ho-oh. ..
And become the rainbow hero.

918
01:26:27,219 --> 01:26:28,261
Ho?

919
01:26:28,345 --> 01:26:29,721
Oh!

920
01:26:29,763 --> 01:26:31,389
Yo, ho, ho-oh ho!

921
01:26:35,352 --> 01:26:37,312
- It's all downhill from here!
- It's all downhill from here!

922
01:27:12,556 --> 01:27:14,724
Looks like everybody's
healthy again!

923
01:27:14,892 --> 01:27:17,144
And that's the power of ho-oh!

924
01:27:17,227 --> 01:27:18,269
Pikachu?

925
01:27:27,821 --> 01:27:30,615
Ho-oh! Let's have a battle!

926
01:27:54,932 --> 01:27:57,392
Pikachu! I choose you!

927
01:27:58,602 --> 01:28:00,312
Alright! Use thunderbolt!

928
01:28:42,813 --> 01:28:43,772
Excuse me!

929
01:28:45,816 --> 01:28:48,360
Oh, my! You were battling,
weren't you?

930
01:28:48,652 --> 01:28:49,694
Who was it this time?

931
01:28:50,112 --> 01:28:51,238
It was ho-oh.

932
01:28:51,572 --> 01:28:52,656
That's nice...

933
01:28:54,658 --> 01:28:55,659
What?

934
01:28:59,830 --> 01:29:01,706
The atmosphere is crystal clear!

935
01:29:02,166 --> 01:29:03,542
Somewhere in the world...

936
01:29:03,667 --> 01:29:07,712
There's a new trainer,
soon to be the rainbow hero.

937
01:29:08,630 --> 01:29:10,131
Young men and women, live on!

938
01:29:10,174 --> 01:29:12,092
Just keep on living on!

939
01:29:12,176 --> 01:29:15,053
And if you do,
a path will open for you!

940
01:29:15,179 --> 01:29:18,724
The future is bathed in
a rainbow-colored light!

941
01:29:27,441 --> 01:29:30,819
I'm going to get even stronger.
And someday we'll battle again.

942
01:29:31,278 --> 01:29:34,072
Okay! And I'll give it
everything I've got!

943
01:29:35,365 --> 01:29:38,076
Just don't lose
to anyone before then.

944
01:29:48,337 --> 01:29:50,172
This is where
our paths must part.

945
01:29:50,214 --> 01:29:51,715
I'm off to learn
about the legends of

946
01:29:51,757 --> 01:29:54,342
articuno, zapdos, and moltres.

947
01:29:54,676 --> 01:29:56,844
I think I'm going
to head on back home.

948
01:29:56,929 --> 01:29:58,639
I'd really like to see my mom!

949
01:29:58,722 --> 01:29:59,889
What about you?

950
01:30:00,057 --> 01:30:02,851
You know me!
I'm going my own way!

951
01:30:03,143 --> 01:30:05,228
Working to become
a pokémon master!

952
01:30:06,563 --> 01:30:09,107
I hope we get to meet again
in the future.

953
01:30:16,615 --> 01:30:18,450
- Then we'll have a battle!
- Then we'll have a battle!

954
01:30:56,738 --> 01:30:58,156
Let's go, pikachu!

955
01:31:04,955 --> 01:31:07,666
The always-fascinating
world of pokémon,

956
01:31:07,708 --> 01:31:10,711
the most diverse and
unusual creatures on the planet.

957
01:31:10,836 --> 01:31:15,257
They can be found up in the sky,
under the sea, in forests,

958
01:31:15,299 --> 01:31:16,508
and living in towns.

959
01:31:16,925 --> 01:31:20,345
One can see pokémon in
every corner of the world!

960
01:31:20,554 --> 01:31:24,224
People and pokémon,
forming all kinds of bonds,

961
01:31:24,266 --> 01:31:26,226
and living
harmoniously in a world

962
01:31:26,268 --> 01:31:27,769
made just for them...

963
01:31:33,358 --> 01:31:36,527
And this young man,
ash ketchum from pallet town,

964
01:31:36,570 --> 01:31:39,698
together with his partner pikachu,
continues to work

965
01:31:39,740 --> 01:31:42,909
toward his goal of
becoming a pokémon master.

966
01:31:43,827 --> 01:31:46,037
And as many
pokémon as there are...

967
01:31:46,079 --> 01:31:49,364
Well, our hero has just
as many dreams to follow,

968
01:31:49,374 --> 01:31:52,627
and just as many
adventures to come!
