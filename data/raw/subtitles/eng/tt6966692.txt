352
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:02,351

Yes.

354
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:05,554
And I'm about to embark
on a concert tour,

355
00:16:05,556 --> 00:16:07,489

will be down south.

356

"Titsburgh."

710

have larger breasts

Fortunately,
a man who had seen me play

arranged for me to study

1605
01:20:51,710 --> 01:20:53,743
at the Leningrad Conservatory

Brahms, Franz Liszt,
Beethoven, Chopin.

1610

1611
01:21:09,861 --> 01:21:12,796

by my record company

1612
01:21:12,798 --> 01:21:16,666
to pursue a career
in popular music instead.

1613
01:21:16,668 --> 01:21:19,268

would never accept

to the classic stuff,

As soon as he started playing,
a group of men
