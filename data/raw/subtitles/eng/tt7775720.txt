1
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,835
<i>This isn't how our story
was supposed to end.</i>

2
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,839
<i>But meeting you in the first place</i>

3
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:49,966
<i>was the plot twist I never expected.</i>

4
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:51,509
Mike, what do you got?

5
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:52,802
<i>Fourteen years ago,</i>

6
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,888
<i>it was a most ordinary Tuesday.</i>

7
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:55,972
Earth to Mike.

8
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,850
Oh. Yeah. I'm sorry.

9
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,978
Um... I'm working on a piece titled,

10
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:06,399
<i>"Every Gilmore Girls
Character Ranked from Best to Rory."</i>

11
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,276
Who's Rory?

12
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:10,403
She's one of the Gilmore Girls.

13
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:11,655
Which one?

14
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,657
She's the younger one.

15
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:14,950
Yeah, I don't get it.

16
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,078
<i>Can you give me
something about Fear Factor?</i>

17
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,289
<i>Sure, yeah.
I'll give you something about Fear Factor.</i>

18
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:24,334
<i>My job at TV Guide was a dream,</i>

19
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:27,587
<i>especially as a kid who imagined
his childhood was an '80s sitcom.</i>

20
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:31,258
<i>The Ausiellos.</i>

21
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:34,094
<i>{\an8}With Michael's younger brother,</i>

22
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:36,304
<i>{\an8}and Michael's older brother.</i>

23
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,557
<i>{\an8}--Starring Michael Ausiello...</i>

24
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,893
<i>{\an8}as Michael Ausiello.</i>

25
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,979
{\an8}Hey, kids. I'm home.

26
00:01:45,062 --> 00:01:46,106
{\an8}Mom!

27
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:49,234
<i>{\an8}And featuring Mrs. Ausiello.</i>

28
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,530
Come on. Our soap's about to start.

29
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:58,326
<i>I remember watching
daytime soap operas with my mom.</i>

30
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:00,078
<i>Nurse Angelique, how's the patient?</i>

31
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:01,413
<i>Not good, Dr. Underwood.</i>

32
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,748
<i>All those sad people
in hospitals.</i>

33
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:07,127
<i>I was determined that my story
was going to be a happy one.</i>

34
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,421
<i>And for a while, it was.</i>

35
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,799
<i>I fancied myself as the star
of my very own workplace comedy.</i>

36
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:13,883
Hey, princess.

37
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,219
<i>A little Liz Lemon
and a lot of Will Truman.</i>

38
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:17,345
Holy crap.

39
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:18,722
<i>- That's Nick.</i>

40
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:21,558
<i>He convinces me to do things
like go out to a club on a weeknight.</i>

41
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,810
- It is Jock Night at Nublu.
- Oh.

42
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:26,438
Yeah, so throw on
something like this, and let's go.

43
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:27,814
I'm gonna get you laid.

44
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:29,316
- Come on.
- That sounds really fun,

45
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,943
<i>but I have to finish
this piece on Fear Factor by tomorrow.</i>

46
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:33,987
You work too much,
and you need to get out more.

47
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:36,948
Come on.

48
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,367
Yeah! Let's do it!

49
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:48,960
<i>I just can't get you out of my head</i>

50
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:53,298
<i>Boy, your loving is all I think about</i>

51
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:56,927
<i>I just can't get you out of my head</i>

52
00:02:57,302 --> 00:03:01,222
<i>Boy, it's more
than I dare to think about...</i>

53
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,474
I don't belong here.

54
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,309
Mmm. Sure, you do.

55
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:07,020
It's Jock Night, and you're a runner.

56
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:10,023
I'm a jogger.
I'm not a runner. Jogging's not a sport.

57
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,443
Please. Are you allergic to fun, Michael?

58
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:16,112
<i>Boy, your loving is all I think about...</i>

59
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:20,325
<i>And there you were,
like some sweatband-wearing matinee idol.</i>

60
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:21,910
<i>I'll just shut up now.</i>

61
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:27,499
Oh. That guy is definitely into you.

62
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:28,708
He was with a woman.

63
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,421
No man in this club
has been with a woman in years,

64
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,881
- if ever.
- Oh, my God.

65
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:36,716
- He's walking over here.
- Oh. Ignore me.

66
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,718
- Nick, please. Don't do that.
- Ignore me. Ignore me.

67
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:40,553
I'm just a random gay man.

68
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,348
- Hey.
- Hi.

69
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:44,724
What's up?

70
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:45,976
"What's up"?

71
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:49,771
You were looking over, and you waved,

72
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:50,939
and you were making that face, so...

73
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:53,857
I know. We were just...
We were smiling at each other, so I...

74
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:57,237
Uh... you were smiling at me, right?

75
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,573
Well, actually,
my friend Nina was getting me a drink,

76
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:00,657
so I was just looking.

77
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:03,243
Oh, Jesus.
So you weren't looking at me.

78
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,578
You were looking behind me.

79
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,413
- Well, I mean, no, I was...
- Oh, my God.

80
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:07,747
- Okay. That's mortifying.
- Hey, you guys.

81
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,291
- No, it's...
- Hello.

82
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,334
You are so his type.

83
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:12,919
Okay, she's had a few too many.

84
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:14,004
No, I haven't.

85
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,798
Yes, I have. Yes, I have.
But you are still his type.

86
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:17,924
- Well, 'cause you're...
- Oh.

87
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:19,301
You're, like a dweeb.

88
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,052
- I'm what?
- Tall. She means tall.

89
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:23,680
- You mean tall.
- Yes. A tall dweeb.

90
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,265
- That is what I meant.
- Oh, my... Okay.

91
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,017
- Wow.
- It doesn't matter. Don't be embarrassed.

92
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,101
Everybody has a type.

93
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:31,271
My type is very handsome gay men.

94
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:33,940
Which is why I am hopelessly single.

95
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:35,442
- I'm dancing.
- It's...

96
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,193
It's truly a tragedy. It's...

97
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,405
- Well, for me.
- I think for maybe both of us.

98
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:42,198
Did you... Do you want to dance?

99
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,035
No, I don't...
I'm not gonna dance.

100
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,787
Okay. You prefer to watch?

101
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,331
Yes, I like to watch.

102
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,832
- Okay.
- Okay.

103
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,959
Well, let me know if you change your mind.

104
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,797
<i>I just can't get you out of my head</i>

105
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:01,635
<i>Boy, your loving
is all I think about</i>

106
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:05,555
<i>I just can't get you out of my head</i>

107
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:09,559
<i>Boy, it's more than I dare to think about</i>

108
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,521
<i>You make me feel</i>

109
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:16,358
<i>Mighty real...</i>

110
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:18,485
They're dancing!

111
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:22,739
- You're a great dancer.
- You're a terrible liar.

112
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:23,823
Have you been here before?

113
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,909
I wouldn't say that
this is really my scene.

114
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,827
- What's your scene?
- I'm more of

115
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,704
a "work late,
go to bed early" kind of guy.

116
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:30,789
What about you?

117
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,416
I've been here a lot.
Getting a little tired of it.

118
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,002
Maybe you should try another scene.

119
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:37,879
- Maybe I should.
- Maybe you should.

120
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,009
Bold.

121
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:49,140
<i>Oh, you make me feel...</i>

122
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,520
How about... turning the hat?

123
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,772
<i>You make me feel</i>

124
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:57,691
<i>All the time...</i>

125
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,652
So, you want to get out of here
and go back to my place?

126
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,862
I don't even know your name.

127
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:03,989
It's Kit.

128
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,366
- Wait, really?
- You're Kit?

129
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,450
Oh, God. I'm Michael.

130
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:09,452
<i>It's like Michael and KITT
from Knight Rider.</i>

131
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:12,414
It's that David Hasselhoff show
from the '80s. Ran 90 episodes.

132
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,624
- So this is kismet, then?
- Uh, sure.

133
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,836
Except that KITT was a talking car
and the show wasn't very good.

134
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,297
Hey, there you are.

135
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,798
- Oh, God, hi.
- Whoa, whoa.

136
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:25,135
Kit, I need you to take me home
because the room is spinning.

137
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,970
All right. Um, that's my cue.

138
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,722
Oh, yeah, okay. Uh...

139
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:30,890
It's been good to meet you.

140
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,183
Wow. Come on. Jesus.

141
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:33,685
Yeah, it's good to meet you, too.

142
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:37,814
You know what? Actually, here.
This is... This is my card.

143
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,859
It has my number on it
so you can call me sometime.

144
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,361
- Okay.
- Oh, God. I think I'm gonna barf.

145
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:46,156
All right. Let's get you out of here.
Get you out of here.

146
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:47,824
- I'm so sorry.
- Come on.

147
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,243
<i>I never thought
I'd hear from you.</i>

148
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:52,329
<i>But then you called.</i>

149
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:55,165
You do own a TV set, right?

150
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:58,001
I think my roommate Kirby does.

151
00:06:58,668 --> 00:06:59,669
Is that shocking to you?

152
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,922
Shocking? No, it's not shocking.
I've heard of people

153
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,840
who don't have TVs,
but I've never met one.

154
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:04,925
It's nice to meet you.

155
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,468
Educate me.
What's your favorite TV show?

156
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:08,386
<i>Uh, at the moment? Felicity.</i>

157
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,598
They're doing some new things,
but it's also got a traditional...

158
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,058
I don't know,
there's something comforting about it,

159
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,142
and the actors are great.

160
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,311
Um, is she the one whose haircut
almost got the show canceled?

161
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,898
It is a brilliant show,
and you should watch it.

162
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:23,944
Okay. Should we get a bottle?
This place has an incredible wine list.

163
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:28,114
Um, I think I will stick with Diet Coke.
I'm not really much of a drinker.

164
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,784
I don't really like the taste
or the empty calories.

165
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,161
What about you? Drunkard or junkie?

166
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:36,081
- I'm a photographer.
- Mmm. Both, then.

167
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,586
Well, for now,
I have a day job that pays the bills.

168
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,505
- What is that?
- Così.

169
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,174
New York's finest
fast-casual restaurant chain.

170
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:48,134
Così has
the best flatbread in New York City.

171
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:51,596
Well, I design
their advertising, store signage.

172
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,933
Did you do the new ads for
the hummus-veggie sandwich?

173
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,476
I did, yes.

174
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,811
- That's one of mine.
- Okay, I'm not even kidding,

175
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,896
that is the most beautifully rendered

176
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,731
hummus and veggie sandwich
I have ever seen.

177
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:04,442
And I'm a vegetarian. I've seen
a lot of hummus and veggie pictures.

178
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:06,570
Well, what can I say?
When it comes to lighting bread,

179
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:07,737
I know what's up.

180
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:11,449
I do lunch every day
at the Così on 51st and Broadway.

181
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:17,247
Well, today's
your lucky day, because you...

182
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,375
your next two
flatbread sandwiches are on me.

183
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,669
Shut up! Oh. Marry me.

184
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,296
Oh, God. Is that too soon

185
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,006
to ask you to marry me?

186
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,299
Thank you.

187
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:28,925
You're very welcome.

188
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,805
Uh, what's your...
What's your take on marriage?

189
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,807
Ooh, a serious discussion.

190
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,893
Well, you know, it's topical and...

191
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:40,061
Okay. Well...

192
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:44,858
I consider myself
a bit of a hopeless romantic,

193
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,027
so I guess that makes me pro.

194
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:50,280
And I'm guessing that
you kind of feel differently.

195
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,157
Well, aren't we supposed to be
more advanced than that?

196
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,451
I mean, it started as
the literal selling of chattel.

197
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,661
I don't know if I want to be
a part of that ritual.

198
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:59,122
I think some rituals are kind of sweet.

199
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,207
And some rituals
are actually very important.

200
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,459
Hmm.

201
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:04,628
- What's chattel?
- I don't know.

202
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:07,047
I think it's, like, cattle that chats.

203
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,465
Talking cows?

204
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,511
Middle child, two brothers.

205
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,555
We're actually very close,
but they live in different states,

206
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,223
so we don't see each other very often.

207
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:18,850
- Only child.
- Only...

208
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:20,268
No sisters, no brothers.

209
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,354
Childhood obsessions.

210
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:25,523
Christmas and soaps and...

211
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:27,859
Christmas and soaps and...

212
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:29,319
Nope, there's nothing else.

213
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,529
Christmas and soaps. Period. Go.

214
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:34,532
Uh, childhood obsession, magic.

215
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,534
My stage name was Kit the Conjurer.

216
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:39,120
Kit the Conjurer! The alliteration.

217
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,249
- It's, um... You've got...
- What is it?

218
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,125
You've got something behind your ear.

219
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:45,752
- What? What? Where?
- Uh, it's...

220
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,963
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, Jesus.

221
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:49,381
It's a dinner roll.

222
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,175
- How did that get there?
- How did you do that?

223
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,052
A magician never reveals his secrets.

224
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:57,472
After high school,
I escaped to Los Angeles.

225
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,224
-I went to USC, -Oh.

226
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,643
Where I nurtured
my obsession with television,

227
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,728
<i>which led to
my current job at TV Guide.</i>

228
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,981
Which, I am guessing,
you've never even heard of.

229
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,400
<i>No, no, no. My parents had
a subscription to TV Guide.</i>

230
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:09,484
Oh, thank God.

231
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:13,154
They're retired now.
My dad is a world-class putterer.

232
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:21,079
A good guy. And...
my mom is a triathlete.

233
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:24,040
Your mother's a triath...
As in, like, the whole...

234
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,084
- Mmm. Swimming, biking, running. Yep.
- Shut up.

235
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,877
She is exceptionally driven.

236
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,671
Though not very good.

237
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:31,047
Wow.

238
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,341
Are you close with them?

239
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:36,136
Yeah. I mean, it's complicated.

240
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:38,930
But they're great.
They're essentially great.

241
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,308
What about your parents?

242
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:49,566
Can I just say that this Diet Coke
is the perfect syrup-to-carbonation ratio?

243
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:53,528
This is, like, Chipotle-level perfect.
No one does Diet Coke like Chipotle.

244
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,492
They both passed away.

245
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,953
My father died when I was very young.

246
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:05,290
And my mother, she got cancer
a few years after that, so...

247
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:09,878
Yes, it sucked.

248
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:11,588
I'm so sorry.

249
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,090
It's okay.

250
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,093
Thank you.

251
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:23,308
Watch out.

252
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:27,562
Maybe we should go inside somewhere.
I don't really want to get gay-bashed.

253
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:33,235
Okay. Well, then let's go to your place.

254
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,737
I've never been to Jersey City before.

255
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:39,366
Plus, I have the...
The aforementioned roommate, so...

256
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:43,036
I would love to go to my place,
but they just...

257
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:46,539
They just painted
my apartment, and I'm afraid the fumes

258
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:48,667
might not be safe to breathe in.

259
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,545
Okay. Fine.

260
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,090
Then, let's go to my place.

261
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,591
Okay, let's do that.

262
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,806
I... I'm hoping
my roommate isn't here.

263
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,350
She's very monosyllabic.

264
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:06,851
Okay.

265
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:10,855
Kit?

266
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:15,318
Hey, Kirby.

267
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:16,903
Hey.

268
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:19,531
- Uh, this is Mike.
- Hi, Kirby.

269
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:20,865
Mike.

270
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,535
- Um, we were just gonna...
- You want me to...

271
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:24,869
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay. Okay.

272
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,709
This is my boudoir.

273
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:32,627
Wow.

274
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,092
This is, this is really cool.

275
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,468
Thanks.

276
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,638
So, she's really monosyllabic.

277
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:46,433
Oh, yeah.
I've never seen her leave the apartment.

278
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:49,394
I swear to God
she only eats bagels, toasted.

279
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:52,272
I have to be nice to her, though.
She pays more rent than me.

280
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,359
You want some weed?

281
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,778
Oh no, I'm okay. Thank you.

282
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,113
Okay.

283
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:03,575
<i>Walk out into velvet</i>

284
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,870
<i>Nothing more to say</i>

285
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:10,040
<i>You're my favorite moment...</i>

286
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,542
So, here we are.

287
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:14,544
So, yes. We're here.

288
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:16,546
<i>'Cause you're my number one</i>

289
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:20,675

Okay, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

301
00:13:57,921 --> 00:13:59,047
Did I...
Did I do something or...

302
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,424
No, no you didn't... No, you...

303
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:02,717
I just... I need to...

304
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,179
I need to pee.
Where's the bathroom?

305
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:12,602
Hi.

306
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,002
Hi, Mom. I'm home.

307
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,461
Hi, honey.

308
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:40,088
How was school today?

309
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:41,339
Kind of a drag.

310
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:44,509
One of the other kids
called me Dead Dad Mike,

311
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:46,052
the Fat Fudge Packer,

312
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:49,306
in front of my US history
and geography class,

313
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:50,890
and they all laughed at me.

314
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,642
Honey, come here.

315
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:57,022
What have I always told you?

316
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,482
It's what's on the inside that counts.

317
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:03,653
Someday you're gonna grow up to be
the best TV journalist in the world.

318
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,906
- Mom.
- I love you so much.

319
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,452
Enjoy yourself.

I'm sorry. I'll get that.

326
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,848
Just... jump.

Here. Oh, God.

328
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,396

00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:23,817
I mean, you just ripped off your clothes

346
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,652
like you're a stripper
at a bachelorette party,

347
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:26,903
and you look...

348
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:28,905
- you look incredible.
- No.

349
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:32,325
And I'm... I'm an FFK.

350
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,912
You don't know what that is, do you?

351
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:38,039
- No. No.
- I'm a former fat kid.

352
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:41,334
So I have some body issues.

353
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:44,253
- Mmm-hmm.
- Especially around this...

354
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:46,464
Like, I basically shower
with clothes on, so I...

355
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:49,216
- What?
- Oh, my God. This is so embarrassing.

356
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:50,385
- I should leave.
- No.

357
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:52,137
Should I just leave?
I should leave.

358
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,681
Yeah, you should probably...
you should probably go.

359
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:55,889
Yeah.

360
00:16:57,893 --> 00:16:59,936
It's okay. We don't have
to do anything. We can...

361
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:03,398
We can just talk.
We can just talk.

362
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:08,278
- Or I can tickle you.
- Stop! Don't do that.

363
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:13,325
- We can just talk. Yeah.
- We can talk?

364
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:17,162
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. No pressure.

365
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:19,247
We can just talk.

366
00:17:19,331 --> 00:17:22,334
We could just lay here and... talk.

367
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:24,044
- We can talk?
- Yeah.

368
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,046
- Okay.
- No pressure.

369
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,214
Okay.

370
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,052
What should we talk about?

371
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:36,473
Oh, that's a good question.

372
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:38,683
Um...

373
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:42,646
When, when did you know you were gay?

374
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:44,147
- Oh.
- Mmm-hmm.

375
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:45,857
- Big question.
- God...

376
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:47,359
Fifth grade.

377
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:52,697
<i>I was watching
Days of Our Lives with my mother.</i>

378
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:53,782
Uh-huh.

379
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:57,661
And she caught me literally
drooling over a shirtless Bo Brady.

380
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:58,787
Oh!

381
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:04,501
And it is awkward to realize you're gay

382
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:07,462
at the same moment
your mother is realizing

383
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:10,799
- that you're realizing you're gay.
- You were like 12?

384
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:13,510
Eleven, twelve...
I don't give a... Yeah, she knew.

385
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,053
Oh, my God.
My parents still don't know.

386
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:16,221
- I mean, I had girlfriends...
- What?

387
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:17,430
Right up until after college.

388
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:18,890
- They have no idea.
- No.

389
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,394
Why haven't you told them?

390
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:24,437
Uh, um...

391
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:28,984
Because it took a long time
for me to accept it myself, and...

392
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:32,862
I think it will be tough for them.

393
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:36,283
And I don't think
I'm ready to tell them. I...

394
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:38,076
I don't know.

395
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:06,688
<i>There's a place I dream about</i>

396
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:11,568
<i>Where the sun never goes out</i>

397
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:15,906
<i>And the sky is deep and blue</i>

398
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:18,241
<i>Won't you take me...</i>

399
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:19,492
This okay?

400
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:25,874
Yes.

401
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:28,585
Thank you.

402
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:35,800
<i>Ooh, we can begin again...</i>

403
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,679
<i>I changed my outfit
seven times before this date.</i>

404
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:43,892
<i>You always felt
like premium cable to my network sitcom.</i>

405
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:45,810
- Hi. Good to see you.
- It's good to see you.

406
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:48,772
- Hi.
- So you must be Michael.

407
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,941
I didn't realize
I was in "must be" territory.

408
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,108
You've already met him, Nina.

409
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:55,195
Oh, my God. Jock Night.

410
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:56,821
- Jock Night.
- You are the tall dweeb.

411
00:19:56,947 --> 00:19:58,406
Is that what I'm gonna be called?

412
00:19:58,490 --> 00:19:59,950
No, no, no. Isn't this place beautiful?

413
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:01,618
- Can you believe that she works here?
- It's quite stunning.

414
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,119
It really is. It's...

415
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:04,704
It's an atelier.

416
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,373
Ateli... What?

417
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:08,792
It's... You know what?
It's just a designer showroom.

418
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:09,876
- Well, it's beautiful.
- But Kit can tell you

419
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,753
all about it when he starts working here.

420
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:13,922
Yeah, we need someone
to do some photographs for our catalog.

421
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:15,006
That'd be cool.

422
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:17,342
Nina loves to taunt me
with false promises of employment...

423
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:19,761
Can I get anyone a drink?
A Diet Coke?

424
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:22,555
I feel very seen. Thank you.

425
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:23,932
So, Michael...

426
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:26,059
- Yes.
- What is your whole life story?

427
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,811
One sentence. Tell me everything.

428
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:30,021
Actually, you know what?
Let's make it fun.

429
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:31,648
Life story. One word. Go.

430
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:34,025
- Basically...
- "Basically."

431
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:35,986
Oh, I like that. That is fascinating.

432
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:38,029
- Okay, you. One word.
- Impatient.

433
00:20:38,113 --> 00:20:39,781
- That actually makes a lot of...
- Hold that thought.

434
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:41,449
Have you seen the black apple?

435
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,952
Well... I don't know what that means.

436
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:46,621
- Come. Come, come, come. He'll find us.
- I can't imagine that I have. Okay.

437
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:48,873
It's... Excuse me.

438
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:53,503
So, I would say that it blurs the lines
between art and produce,

439
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:56,590
and that it hearkens back
to the Gilded Age.

440
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:58,717
There's a certain opulence about it.

441
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:01,052
That's a very impressive analysis.
He's a real pro.

442
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:04,347
Yeah, well, it reminds us that sometimes
life is just black and white

443
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:07,726
and that sometimes
an apple is just an apple and it's good.

444
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:10,145
- Is this good?
- No, it's terrible.

445
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:11,980
- It's terrible?
- Yes.

446
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:14,983
At best, it belongs
in a high-end doctor's office.

447
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:16,067
Stop. You're being generous.

448
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:18,028
I could see this
in a low-end dentist's office.

449
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:20,113
I give you an A for effort. Cheers.

450
00:21:20,238 --> 00:21:21,281
Phew. Thank you.

451
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:23,450
- I hate that.
- You did very well.

452
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:24,826
Yeah, you should. It's not good at all.

453
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:27,078
This is the roof garden.

454
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,706
- Oh, my goodness.
- Isn't it amazing?

455
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:32,292
Yeah, look at this. It's beautiful.

456
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:35,503
They all really like you, by the way.

457
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:37,547
I feel like Nina hates me.

458
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:40,342
No, no. If she didn't like you,
she'd be much more accommodating.

459
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,928
- I promise.
- Oh, that's good to know.

460
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:54,356
I love this city.

461
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:59,194
- Thank you for coming tonight.
- Thank you for having me.

462
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,613
It's a pleasure to have you as my date.

463
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:07,035
So, um, shall we go
to your place tonight?

464
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:11,122
The last bus is in like half an hour.
I don't even know if we...

465
00:22:11,206 --> 00:22:13,041
Come on.
We could make that, easy. It'd be fun.

466
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:15,210
Clearly, you've never been
to Port Authority on a Friday night.

467
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:17,087
Is there a reason
you don't want me to see your place?

468
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,588
I mean, at first, it was paint fumes,

469
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:20,757
and now you
hiding a dead body or something? I...

470
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,885
No, no. There's no... That's ridiculous.

471
00:22:24,135 --> 00:22:26,888
The whole idea that I wouldn't want you
to see my place, that's ridiculous.

472
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:28,598
Okay, then. So?

473
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:29,933
Okay.

474
00:22:31,101 --> 00:22:32,352
Fine. We'll go to my place.

475
00:22:33,562 --> 00:22:34,771
If that's what you want.

476
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,815
- Oh, it's what I want, Michael.
- Okay, then.

477
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:38,149
- That's what we'll do.
- Mmm-hmm.

478
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:41,194
- We'll go to my place.
- Mmm-hmm.

479
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:43,989
- Now?
- Yeah.

480
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:45,448
Let's go.

481
00:22:47,576 --> 00:22:48,618
- All right.
- Come on.

482
00:22:48,702 --> 00:22:49,744
Let's go.

483
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:55,500
And this is the hallway. Just...

484
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:57,836
Eggshell white on the...

485
00:22:58,295 --> 00:22:59,921
- The wall.
- That's a lovely color.

486
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:02,382
And, um, here's my door.

487
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:06,595
This is just your...
all-American, typical door.

488
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:12,309
And so, um, I guess
I'll just open the door

489
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:14,853
and we can go inside.

490
00:23:14,936 --> 00:23:17,105
Yep. That's, that's usually
how it works, Michael.

491
00:23:17,689 --> 00:23:19,733
Before we go in, I want to remind you

492
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:22,736
that your friends said
that they really like me.

493
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:24,571
Oh, Jesus. Just open the door.

494
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,031
Okay.

495
00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:30,619
I mean, I'm just a person like everybody.

496
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:32,621
Come on. Let me see your apartment.

497
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:35,498
Come on.

498
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:37,208
Okay.

499
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:41,504
Okay. So, um...

500
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:46,134
This is where I live.

501
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:48,011
My apartment.

502
00:23:51,973 --> 00:23:53,099
Home sweet home.

503
00:24:04,986 --> 00:24:05,987
Okay.

504
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:07,197
Um...

505
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:09,950
- Oh, you don't want to...
- Oh, my God.

506
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:11,660
- They're in here, too.
- Go in the bedroom.

507
00:24:22,921 --> 00:24:24,005
Oh, Papa.

508
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:33,848
What is this, Michael?

509
00:24:35,976 --> 00:24:37,018
They're Smurfs.

510
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:39,896
Yes, I... I can see that.

511
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,898
Is it... Is it a fetish?

512
00:24:41,982 --> 00:24:46,111
Oh, God, no. This is not a fetish.
No, this is, uh... I guess it's a hobby.

513
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:48,238
Or... maybe it's a passion.

514
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:51,116
Uh, I started collecting these
when I was ten.

515
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:53,994
It was my friend Linda Swzedo's fault.
She got me into them.

516
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:57,581
She was totally obsessed with them,
and then I became obsessed, too.

517
00:24:57,914 --> 00:25:01,293
Uh, my mother would take me
to Gift Expressions

518
00:25:01,376 --> 00:25:03,920
every Sunday
after I helped her grocery shop,

519
00:25:04,004 --> 00:25:07,340
and she would buy me
a Smurf figurine as a reward.

520
00:25:08,466 --> 00:25:12,721
My favorite was Vanity Smurf,
who I now realize was a total closet case.

521
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:14,639
Like I was. And then...

522
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:19,311
I don't know, after my mom died,
I did take a ten-year Smurf sabbatical.

523
00:25:19,644 --> 00:25:20,854
But along came eBay,

524
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:22,856
and then I just kind of...
all hell broke loose.

525
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:25,650
I started going to toy shows,
and I went to flea markets.

526
00:25:25,734 --> 00:25:29,070
I was buying and selling and trading...
And I really can't defend this.

527
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:33,199
Yeah.

528
00:25:34,451 --> 00:25:37,829
I think that they take me back in time.

529
00:25:38,163 --> 00:25:39,748
You know, like...

530
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,460
to before my mom died.

531
00:25:44,294 --> 00:25:45,545
When...

532
00:25:48,048 --> 00:25:49,799
When things were easier.

533
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:54,387
I think that you can imagine
why I was a little hesitant

534
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:56,097
to bring you to my apartment.

535
00:26:00,685 --> 00:26:01,895
Say something.

536
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:05,190
I...

537
00:26:11,696 --> 00:26:13,031
I fooled around with someone.

538
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:15,617
At the gym last week.

539
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:21,748
I know that you and I have never had
the "exclusive" conversation, and...

540
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:24,417
I don't know. I, um...

541
00:26:25,126 --> 00:26:26,711
I feel guilty about it.

542
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,047
Why are you telling me this?

543
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:30,548
Because I feel guilty about it.

544
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:33,009
And that's new for me, Michael.

545
00:26:34,344 --> 00:26:36,304
You know, I've never actually had
a real relationship before.

546
00:26:36,388 --> 00:26:37,973
A... boyfriend.

547
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:40,892
Just a lot of casual hookups.

548
00:26:41,142 --> 00:26:43,979
And, you know, I don't usually want
more than that, but...

549
00:26:44,604 --> 00:26:49,901
If someone gets too attached,
I get out of there, and this...

550
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:52,487
You...

551
00:26:53,989 --> 00:26:55,448
It scares me.

552
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:06,751
You scare me, too.

553
00:27:08,086 --> 00:27:09,796
I think you're very cool.

554
00:27:10,714 --> 00:27:12,549
I think your friends are very cool.

555
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:15,260
And I now know that you go to the gym

556
00:27:15,343 --> 00:27:18,346
for things other than
weight lifting and treadmill.

557
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:23,852
And I'm worried
that I'm going to fall in love with you

558
00:27:24,769 --> 00:27:26,563
and you're going to break my heart.

559
00:27:29,524 --> 00:27:30,817
That scares me.

560
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:34,779
I guess we scare each other.

561
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:37,240
I guess we do.

562
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:44,205
<i>Smurfgate almost derailed us,
but by Christmas, we were back on track.</i>

563
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:48,001
Merry Christmas.

564
00:27:51,046 --> 00:27:52,297
How old is this thing?

565
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,883
1960s. So, it's not
exactly your childhood,

566
00:27:54,966 --> 00:27:56,092
but you know...

567
00:27:56,176 --> 00:27:59,429
It's got the wand and the cups
and the lady that you saw in half.

568
00:27:59,596 --> 00:28:01,222
Where did you get it?

569
00:28:01,306 --> 00:28:02,891
Oh, you could buy anything on eBay.

570
00:28:02,974 --> 00:28:04,017
It's really special, Mike.

571
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,810
You'll be happy to know
that I was able to resist

572
00:28:05,894 --> 00:28:08,939
<i>a super rare
Christmas Carol Smurf that was $300.</i>

573
00:28:09,022 --> 00:28:10,982
- Must have taken a lot of self-control.
- It did.

574
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:13,777
- I love it.
- Good.

575
00:28:14,194 --> 00:28:15,320
Thank you.

576
00:28:18,907 --> 00:28:20,909
- I got you something.
- You did?

577
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:22,619
Stand up.

578
00:28:22,702 --> 00:28:23,912
Not as good as yours.

579
00:28:27,874 --> 00:28:28,959
Close your eyes.

580
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:30,335
- Close your eyes.
- Okay.

581
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:32,921
- You better be very careful.
- I'm gonna be very careful.

582
00:28:33,004 --> 00:28:34,714
- I don't like this at all.
- You're very important to me.

583
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:36,466
I just don't like
walking blind like this.

584
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:37,842
Well, okay, I think we've gotten
to the point in our relationship

585
00:28:37,926 --> 00:28:39,302
where you can
trust me a month and a half in.

586
00:28:39,386 --> 00:28:41,179
I do. I just... hate a stubbed toe.

587
00:28:41,263 --> 00:28:43,181
- Your shoulders feel great.
- Oh, thank you.

588
00:28:45,141 --> 00:28:46,184
- Okay.
- Okay.

589
00:28:46,268 --> 00:28:47,644
- Now, you just stay there.
- Okay.

590
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:48,770
Okay.

591
00:28:49,938 --> 00:28:51,606
- Okay.
- Oh, God.

592
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:53,858
- Am I going back in the closet?
- Oh, they wouldn't accept you.

593
00:28:53,942 --> 00:28:55,694
That's mean.

594
00:28:56,945 --> 00:28:59,030
- Okay. And...
- Okay.

595
00:28:59,864 --> 00:29:00,949
Open your eyes.

596
00:29:01,491 --> 00:29:02,534
Ta-da!

597
00:29:02,617 --> 00:29:04,911
Your very own closet space.

598
00:29:06,037 --> 00:29:07,706
- Did you, did you make that?
- I did.

599
00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:09,416
You can put your sleep shorts here.

600
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:13,378
And you can hang your pants on a hanger.

601
00:29:13,712 --> 00:29:14,879
Put them here.

602
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:17,549
And your wallet and your keys
in the sundries box.

603
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:19,759
That's where the sundries go.

604
00:29:19,884 --> 00:29:20,927
Merry Christmas.

605
00:29:24,431 --> 00:29:25,682
- You're staring at me.
- Yes.

606
00:29:29,561 --> 00:29:30,896
- I love...
- Love you.

607
00:29:31,146 --> 00:29:32,439
- What the hell?
- Oh.

608
00:29:32,522 --> 00:29:34,274
- That was my line.
- Well, you hesitated.

609
00:29:34,357 --> 00:29:36,401
- You snooze, you lose. You did.
- No. I did not hesitate.

610
00:29:36,484 --> 00:29:38,153
I was giving the words room to breathe.

611
00:29:38,236 --> 00:29:39,321
Well, let the record show
I said it first.

612
00:29:39,404 --> 00:29:43,199
Kit, at the very least,
we've said it at the same time.

613
00:29:43,283 --> 00:29:44,784
- That's not what the record shows.
- I love you.

614
00:29:46,703 --> 00:29:47,913
I love you, too.

615
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:53,752
<i>Dr. Patel to CCU.</i>

616
00:29:54,294 --> 00:29:56,004
<i>Dr. Patel to CCU.</i>

617
00:29:56,087 --> 00:29:58,798
<i>Don't worry.
We're not at the bad part yet.</i>

618
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:01,176
- How's he doing?
- Good.

619
00:30:01,259 --> 00:30:04,179
He's been dozing in and out.
Are you family?

620
00:30:04,262 --> 00:30:05,805
Oh, uh, no. I'm his boyfriend.

621
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,061
Oh, God.

622
00:30:12,896 --> 00:30:15,148
- Are you gonna get that?
- It's his mother.

623
00:30:15,232 --> 00:30:16,650
He told me to call her
and tell her not to come.

624
00:30:16,733 --> 00:30:18,026
I've never even met the woman.

625
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,445
- Oh.
- Hello?

626
00:30:21,488 --> 00:30:22,781
Hi, Mrs. Cowan.

627
00:30:23,698 --> 00:30:26,534
Yes, this is Michael. Ausiello.

628
00:30:27,994 --> 00:30:29,037
Yes, Kit's doing fine.

629
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,456
Apparently, it was appendicitis,
but he's doing really well now.

630
00:30:32,582 --> 00:30:34,960
Yes, he told me to tell you
there's no need for you to come.

631
00:30:36,127 --> 00:30:37,420
On 10th Avenue.

632
00:30:38,421 --> 00:30:40,382
Between 58th and 59th.

633
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,343
I'll tell him you're coming.

634
00:30:44,219 --> 00:30:45,220
Shit.

635
00:30:46,638 --> 00:30:47,806
I'll be back.

636
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:51,768
Hey.

637
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:52,936
How are you feeling?

638
00:30:53,645 --> 00:30:56,106
- Is she coming?
- They're driving overnight.

639
00:30:56,273 --> 00:30:57,607
- Overnight?
- Yeah.

640
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,151
I need you to do me a favor.

641
00:31:00,694 --> 00:31:02,279
- They stay with me when they come.
- Mmm.

642
00:31:02,404 --> 00:31:04,864
I need you to go to my apartment
and clean up.

643
00:31:05,448 --> 00:31:07,450
What do you want?
You mean like make the bed?

644
00:31:07,534 --> 00:31:10,704
No, I need you
to hide anything that looks... gay.

645
00:31:11,538 --> 00:31:14,291
You want me to de-gay
your apartment?

646
00:31:14,374 --> 00:31:15,542
Yes, de-gay my apartment.

647
00:31:16,084 --> 00:31:19,296
My art books, some of my prints,
any suspect clothing lying around.

648
00:31:20,213 --> 00:31:23,008
And you should probably
take down my Christmas gift to you.

649
00:31:25,969 --> 00:31:26,970
Okay.

650
00:31:33,768 --> 00:31:35,020
You're a big baby.

651
00:31:44,529 --> 00:31:45,989
Could be a tell.

652
00:31:51,411 --> 00:31:52,746
Yeah, cover it.

653
00:31:58,335 --> 00:32:00,211
<i>{\an8}This is a call</i>

654
00:32:00,295 --> 00:32:02,547
<i>{\an8}A call to all</i>

655
00:32:02,631 --> 00:32:04,257
<i>It goes out to...</i>

656
00:32:04,341 --> 00:32:05,634
I don't know what to do with this.

657
00:32:06,676 --> 00:32:07,677
Put it there.

658
00:32:11,306 --> 00:32:12,307
Yeah, that's not good.

659
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:14,517
<i>Maybe once a week on Mondays</i>

660
00:32:14,601 --> 00:32:16,811
<i>You should've seen</i>

661
00:32:16,895 --> 00:32:18,939
<i>What I've seen</i>

662
00:32:19,022 --> 00:32:20,482
<i>She doubles up</i>

663
00:32:20,565 --> 00:32:22,609
<i>And comes back Sunday...</i>

664
00:32:23,526 --> 00:32:25,070
<i>And she will come</i>

665
00:32:25,362 --> 00:32:27,530
<i>Into your heart...</i>

666
00:32:27,781 --> 00:32:29,449
What's gay about this sweater?

667
00:32:40,961 --> 00:32:42,087
I'm sorry.

668
00:32:46,216 --> 00:32:49,344
Mom, what are you doing?
Stop creating problems just to fix them.

669
00:32:49,427 --> 00:32:52,931
It is cold outside.
That thing won't keep you warm.

670
00:32:53,765 --> 00:32:56,309
I'm not going onto the streets of New York
wearing a stolen hospital blanket.

671
00:32:56,393 --> 00:32:57,435
- Yes, you are.
- You'll get me arrested, woman.

672
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,603
Yes, you are.
No one will notice.

673
00:32:58,687 --> 00:33:00,772
- Okay, there, there, there.
- There it is.

674
00:33:00,855 --> 00:33:03,066
- Hey. Did you...
- Hey.

675
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:06,403
Uh, Mom, this is my friend, Michael.

676
00:33:06,486 --> 00:33:08,113
Mike. Uh, you spoke on the phone.

677
00:33:08,196 --> 00:33:10,240
- Ah.
- Mike, this is my mother Marilyn.

678
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:11,992
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

679
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:13,868
Watch out.
She's in quite a mood.

680
00:33:15,787 --> 00:33:19,082
We're just waiting for the wheelchair,
and then we're getting out of here.

681
00:33:19,165 --> 00:33:20,709
Sure. How are you?

682
00:33:21,042 --> 00:33:23,920
Sore. But, you know, Vicodin is tasty.

683
00:33:24,004 --> 00:33:25,422
Got the extra strength, baby.

684
00:33:25,589 --> 00:33:28,216
So... Mrs. Cowan, how was the drive in?

685
00:33:28,466 --> 00:33:31,595
Terrible. I wanted to take
the first bus from Kutztown,

686
00:33:31,678 --> 00:33:34,514
but, oh, no. Oh, no.
Your father wanted to drive.

687
00:33:34,598 --> 00:33:38,518
He was absolutely insistent.
And, of course, he got completely lost.

688
00:33:38,643 --> 00:33:41,646
We were practically in Buffalo
when he had to turn back around.

689
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:45,650
Well, I hear
they have some good wings up in Buffalo.

690
00:33:47,694 --> 00:33:49,153
Wings? What do you mean, "wings"?

691
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:53,115
It's Buffalo wing... chicken wings.

692
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,577
Chicken wings?
Chicken wing... I love chicken wings.

693
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,872
Yeah, you know,
I was just referencing Buffalo wings.

694
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,416
That was good. Love that.

695
00:34:01,624 --> 00:34:03,584
So, um, where is Bob?

696
00:34:04,044 --> 00:34:06,129
Bob? You mean my husband?

697
00:34:06,338 --> 00:34:09,215
Yes.
I'm sorry Where's Mr. Cowan?

698
00:34:09,298 --> 00:34:11,801
He's parking the car.
I warn you right now,

699
00:34:11,885 --> 00:34:13,303
- he is in a terrible mood.
- Yeah.

700
00:34:13,386 --> 00:34:14,679
My dad hates the city with a passion.

701
00:34:14,888 --> 00:34:16,640
Bob. Here we are.

702
00:34:16,932 --> 00:34:18,140
- Ah, there's my ride.
- Christ.

703
00:34:18,224 --> 00:34:21,394
Do you realize
how expensive it is to park in this town?

704
00:34:21,477 --> 00:34:22,646
It is astronomical.

705
00:34:22,771 --> 00:34:23,854
- Hi, Dad.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah...

706
00:34:23,939 --> 00:34:26,358
Hello, Frog Legs. How are you, lad?
Hi. I'm good.

707
00:34:26,775 --> 00:34:28,651
Dad, this is, uh...
this is my friend, Mike.

708
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,070
- Hi.
- Hi. Bob Cowan.

709
00:34:30,153 --> 00:34:32,197
- Nice to meet you, Mark.
- Good... It's... Michael Ausiello.

710
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,615
- It's good to meet you, too, though.
- Michael. Sorry. Yeah.

711
00:34:33,698 --> 00:34:35,200
It's so good to meet
a friend of Kit's, you know.

712
00:34:35,283 --> 00:34:36,826
- Oh, absolutely.
- Yeah. Yeah.

713
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:38,119
And his dad. It's good to meet his dad.

714
00:34:38,411 --> 00:34:40,580
- Yeah.
- Bob, will you bring the car around?

715
00:34:40,664 --> 00:34:41,665
- We're leaving.
- What?

716
00:34:42,415 --> 00:34:43,750
Christ, I...
Are you kidding, Marilyn?

717
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:45,335
Bob, get the car. Get the car, Bob.

718
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:46,461
- I just parked...
- Get the car.

719
00:34:46,586 --> 00:34:48,755
I just...

720
00:34:48,922 --> 00:34:50,632
- Ugh, Marilyn.
- God.

721
00:34:51,091 --> 00:34:52,926
I can't believe
you walked up all those stairs.

722
00:34:53,009 --> 00:34:54,010
We're right at the front door, though.

723
00:34:54,094 --> 00:34:55,804
You need an elevator
in this building,

724
00:34:55,887 --> 00:34:57,013
- for goodness' sake.
- Geez, now, take it easy.

725
00:34:57,097 --> 00:34:59,349
- Too... many steps.
- Hey, Kirby.

726
00:34:59,432 --> 00:35:00,433
Hey.

727
00:35:00,809 --> 00:35:02,477
Uh, you know my mom and dad.

728
00:35:02,727 --> 00:35:06,106
- Hi, Kirby.
- And this is my friend, Mike.

729
00:35:06,523 --> 00:35:07,524
Kirby.

730
00:35:07,816 --> 00:35:08,817
Right.

731
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,110
You know, I'm gonna run
to the restroom. My...

732
00:35:10,193 --> 00:35:11,653
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

733
00:35:11,736 --> 00:35:13,280
I just need to use the... you know.

734
00:35:15,615 --> 00:35:17,117
Two flights of stairs.

735
00:35:18,034 --> 00:35:19,536
- Honestly.
- Oof.

736
00:35:29,879 --> 00:35:31,715
He seems to be
moving around pretty well,

737
00:35:31,965 --> 00:35:33,216
con... considering.

738
00:35:34,134 --> 00:35:35,135
Yeah.

739
00:35:39,764 --> 00:35:41,808
So, you... live in the building?

740
00:35:41,975 --> 00:35:44,394
Uh, no, actually, I... I live in Jersey.

741
00:35:44,978 --> 00:35:45,979
Oh.

742
00:35:46,396 --> 00:35:48,690
But you work close by?

743
00:35:49,024 --> 00:35:51,359
Uh, well, not that close.
I work in Midtown.

744
00:35:51,776 --> 00:35:52,777
Oh.

745
00:35:56,823 --> 00:35:58,199
So, um, Mike?

746
00:35:58,325 --> 00:35:59,326
Yes.

747
00:35:59,409 --> 00:36:00,577
What do you do?

748
00:36:01,161 --> 00:36:03,955
Uh, well, I'm a journalist.
I write about TV.

749
00:36:04,414 --> 00:36:05,457
- Oh.
- Yeah.

750
00:36:05,665 --> 00:36:06,666
How nice.

751
00:36:08,501 --> 00:36:10,503
Do... you watch TV?

752
00:36:10,837 --> 00:36:11,838
Yes.

753
00:36:12,213 --> 00:36:13,882
- Koppel.
- Koppel?

754
00:36:14,257 --> 00:36:15,383
<i>Nightline.</i>

755
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:16,760
- Oh, sure. Ted. Yeah.
- Yeah.

756
00:36:16,885 --> 00:36:18,178
Do you write about him?

757
00:36:19,471 --> 00:36:20,805
- About Koppel?
- Mmm-hmm.

758
00:36:20,889 --> 00:36:23,975
Uh... No, I don't... I don't think
I've written anything about Ted Koppel.

759
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:26,102
- No? Maybe you should.
- I think you should.

760
00:36:26,186 --> 00:36:27,729
He's not gonna write
about Ted Koppel, guys.

761
00:36:27,812 --> 00:36:29,189
He writes about big TV shows.

762
00:36:29,272 --> 00:36:30,273
Oh.

763
00:36:30,732 --> 00:36:31,733
Okay.

764
00:36:32,234 --> 00:36:33,568
Mike, did you want to...

765
00:36:33,652 --> 00:36:34,778
Yeah. What if I...

766
00:36:34,861 --> 00:36:37,530
Why don't I go get some lunch
or something? You must be famished.

767
00:36:37,614 --> 00:36:43,536
No, no, no, no, no. I've got that covered.
I... made Kit's favorite chicken soup.

768
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,621
All in the duffel.

769
00:36:45,372 --> 00:36:46,373
Uh...

770
00:36:46,873 --> 00:36:47,916
Thanks.

771
00:36:47,999 --> 00:36:51,253
I guess there's really nothing
for me to go get.

772
00:36:51,419 --> 00:36:52,462
Mmm.

773
00:36:52,754 --> 00:36:53,755
Yeah.

774
00:36:54,256 --> 00:36:55,757
How do you guys know each other?

775
00:36:56,091 --> 00:36:57,092
Um...

776
00:36:58,176 --> 00:37:01,346
I'm gonna...
I'll put that chicken soup in the fridge.

777
00:37:01,554 --> 00:37:02,681
- Yeah.
- Okay.

778
00:37:02,764 --> 00:37:04,307
Here we go. I'll be back.

779
00:37:06,268 --> 00:37:08,436
- We met at a bar.
- Really?

780
00:37:08,603 --> 00:37:09,646
You met at a bar?

781
00:37:09,896 --> 00:37:11,648
- Yeah.
- I get that.

782
00:37:12,482 --> 00:37:14,401
It's two guys out, catting around.

783
00:37:15,235 --> 00:37:18,113
Meeting chicks.
You know, a wingman needs a wingman.

784
00:37:18,196 --> 00:37:19,823
- Am I right, Kitty?
- Uh-huh.

785
00:37:21,116 --> 00:37:22,117
Oh, my God.

786
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,829
Um, Bob and I are gonna sleep
on the futon,

787
00:37:25,912 --> 00:37:28,081
so, um, where are the sheets?

788
00:37:28,623 --> 00:37:30,542
- Uh, they're down the hall.
- You know what, I'll go...

789
00:37:30,667 --> 00:37:31,793
I'll get the sheets for you.

790
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,927
So, your friend from the bar
knows where your sheets are?

791
00:37:41,219 --> 00:37:43,930
Yeah, he's crashed here
a few times on the futon,

792
00:37:44,014 --> 00:37:45,849
so he knows where the sheets are.

793
00:37:46,057 --> 00:37:47,267
A friend?

794
00:37:48,059 --> 00:37:49,311
Yeah. A friend.

795
00:37:50,186 --> 00:37:52,480
- Just a friend?
- Yes, Mom. Just a friend.

796
00:37:55,066 --> 00:37:58,361
What is going on here?
Who... Who is this guy?

797
00:37:58,445 --> 00:38:00,196
What's happening? Why is he still here?

798
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,282
I don't understand.
You are acting so weird,

799
00:38:02,365 --> 00:38:03,909
and you don't even
look us in the face...

800
00:38:03,992 --> 00:38:06,620
- You're acting so weird.
- He's my boyfriend, Mom.

801
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:09,331
- Your boyfriend?
- Yes.

802
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:11,833
I'm...

803
00:38:13,793 --> 00:38:15,003
I'm gay.

804
00:38:17,505 --> 00:38:18,590
I'm gay, too.

805
00:38:19,925 --> 00:38:21,593
I am also gay.

806
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,221
I am.

807
00:38:26,056 --> 00:38:27,599
Why couldn't you tell me that?

808
00:38:28,099 --> 00:38:32,145
Why did you keep it such a secret?
What, am I some horrible monster?

809
00:38:32,229 --> 00:38:33,980
- You can't say that to me?
- No, Mom.

810
00:38:34,064 --> 00:38:36,399
You have to just hide it all the time?

811
00:38:36,483 --> 00:38:37,651
I didn't know how to tell you.

812
00:38:37,734 --> 00:38:38,735
- I didn't know how you'd react.
- I don't understand

813
00:38:38,818 --> 00:38:40,654
- why you would do that.
- It's not an easy thing to...

814
00:38:41,112 --> 00:38:42,989
talk about. It's not just easy to...

815
00:38:45,909 --> 00:38:47,118
I think it's great, Kit.

816
00:38:48,536 --> 00:38:50,288
I think it's great that you gays...

817
00:38:50,622 --> 00:38:53,083
That you guys have each other and, uh...

818
00:38:54,376 --> 00:38:56,795
We may not look like it,
but we are actually

819
00:38:56,878 --> 00:38:59,673
kind of hip, your mother and I, and...

820
00:39:00,632 --> 00:39:02,342
We were gonna go to Woodstock, you know.

821
00:39:02,842 --> 00:39:03,843
Oh, yeah.

822
00:39:04,803 --> 00:39:07,013
We had the tickets, but we didn't go.

823
00:39:08,014 --> 00:39:09,933
I just don't know
why you wouldn't tell me.

824
00:39:10,016 --> 00:39:12,185
I call you all the time.
I say, "How are you doing?

825
00:39:12,269 --> 00:39:13,979
"What's new? Who are you seeing?"

826
00:39:14,062 --> 00:39:15,313
You could've just said, "You know what,"

827
00:39:15,397 --> 00:39:16,565
- a long time ago.
- It's hard, Marilyn.

828
00:39:16,648 --> 00:39:19,150
- It's hard.
- Like I'm an outsider or something.

829
00:39:19,651 --> 00:39:20,735
Hello, Mike.

830
00:39:21,069 --> 00:39:22,612
Gosh, good to meet you.

831
00:39:22,862 --> 00:39:25,490
It's nice to meet you, too, Marilyn.

832
00:39:25,574 --> 00:39:26,575
Oh, my God.

833
00:39:29,786 --> 00:39:31,454
<i>It wasn't long
after Bob and Marilyn</i>

834
00:39:31,538 --> 00:39:35,083
<i>went back to Millersburg that we moved in
to our first apartment together.</i>

835
00:39:35,792 --> 00:39:36,876
Where should this go?

836
00:39:37,127 --> 00:39:39,004
I don't know.
Where should this go?

837
00:39:40,422 --> 00:39:41,673
That's cold as hell.

838
00:39:41,756 --> 00:39:43,550
- That's so moody.
- Dusty rusty.

839
00:39:43,633 --> 00:39:45,302
<i>And it even had an outdoor space,</i>

840
00:39:45,385 --> 00:39:48,179
<i>which, by New York standards,
made it positively palatial.</i>

841
00:39:49,764 --> 00:39:51,391
Whoa!

842
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,144
<i>Why I didn't put myself together</i>

843
00:39:54,644 --> 00:39:57,564
<i>As soon as you
appeared into my eyes</i>

844
00:39:59,024 --> 00:40:01,943
<i>Being just one step from being well</i>

845
00:40:02,027 --> 00:40:03,778
- Cheers. To us.
- To us.

846
00:40:11,453 --> 00:40:14,122
<i>Never stop believing in Santa Claus</i>

847
00:40:14,331 --> 00:40:16,124
<i>He's alive, of course</i>

848
00:40:16,207 --> 00:40:19,044
<i>Living in the child in every one of us...</i>

849
00:40:20,837 --> 00:40:22,422
Okay. You can come out now.

850
00:40:26,426 --> 00:40:30,180
Ta-da. Our very first Christmas tree.
Decorated by yours truly.

851
00:40:30,263 --> 00:40:32,182
Uh-huh. Yes. It's, um...

852
00:40:32,807 --> 00:40:34,184
- What?
- A lot of tinsel.

853
00:40:34,267 --> 00:40:35,435
There's tinsel on there, yes.

854
00:40:35,518 --> 00:40:37,938
Uh-huh. And I see a Smurf or two.

855
00:40:38,021 --> 00:40:39,814
- There are some Smurfs. Yes.
- Yes, of course. Yes.

856
00:40:39,898 --> 00:40:42,234
And an entire solar system with a star.

857
00:40:42,317 --> 00:40:43,860
That's a pretty star.

858
00:40:43,944 --> 00:40:45,820
- You hate it.
- I don't hate it.

859
00:40:45,904 --> 00:40:46,988
- No, you hate it.
- It's very you.

860
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:49,074
- Come here. Get down here.
- What are we doing?

861
00:40:49,366 --> 00:40:50,700
Get under the tree.

862
00:40:50,784 --> 00:40:52,494
Is this part of decorating the tree?

863
00:40:52,577 --> 00:40:54,120
- It's part of my tradition.
- Okay.

864
00:40:54,204 --> 00:40:57,332
Every year, when I was young,
I would lay under the tree for hours

865
00:40:57,415 --> 00:40:59,125
listening to my parents
moving around,

866
00:40:59,751 --> 00:41:01,253
getting everything ready for the holidays.

867
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,964
- What?
- Mike.

868
00:41:04,047 --> 00:41:05,173
What?

869
00:41:05,257 --> 00:41:07,050
Your love of Christmas is...

870
00:41:07,133 --> 00:41:08,218
Inspiring?

871
00:41:08,677 --> 00:41:10,470
- Uh, yeah. Yeah, let's...
- It's inspiring.

872
00:41:10,553 --> 00:41:12,138
- Let's go with inspiring.
- It's inspiring. Yeah.

873
00:41:12,222 --> 00:41:13,765
That's what I thought you were gonna say.

874
00:41:16,601 --> 00:41:18,061
I have this fantasy.

875
00:41:18,478 --> 00:41:20,355
Or it's... maybe it's more
like a Christmas wish,

876
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,440
but that, even when I'm older,

877
00:41:23,233 --> 00:41:27,153
I will lie under the tree
like this with my partner,

878
00:41:27,571 --> 00:41:30,991
and we'll just take a moment
to appreciate this beauty.

879
00:41:31,866 --> 00:41:35,829
And even though we're old
and it's getting harder to move

880
00:41:35,912 --> 00:41:38,206
and lying under the tree
really hurt our backs,

881
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:41,084
we're still grateful
because we have each other.

882
00:41:43,336 --> 00:41:44,671
Well, that's very nice.

883
00:41:45,922 --> 00:41:47,173
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

884
00:41:48,758 --> 00:41:49,759
I have an idea.

885
00:41:50,552 --> 00:41:54,222
{\an8}We're taking the first annual
Kit and Mike Christmas photo.

886
00:41:54,848 --> 00:41:56,474
You're not so Scrooge-y after all.

887
00:41:56,558 --> 00:41:58,518
- We've got five seconds.
- You are a pro.

888
00:41:58,602 --> 00:41:59,895
Yeah. Yes.

889
00:42:02,898 --> 00:42:04,107
- Smile.
- I am.

890
00:42:04,733 --> 00:42:05,984
Christmas!

891
00:42:06,067 --> 00:42:07,944
<i>{\an8}Just hear those sleigh bells jingling</i>

892
00:42:08,028 --> 00:42:09,779
<i>{\an8}Ring-ting-tingling, too...</i>

893
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:20,874
<i>{\an8}Years go by pretty quickly
when you count by Christmas trees.</i>

894
00:42:33,845 --> 00:42:35,305
- Michael.
- Yes?

895
00:42:35,388 --> 00:42:37,641
You're drinking Diet Coke
out of a wineglass.

896
00:42:37,724 --> 00:42:39,017
- That's pretty chic.
- Oh, actually,

897
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,936
this is wine in a wineglass, Nina.

898
00:42:41,019 --> 00:42:42,395
Oh, he's already had half a bottle.

899
00:42:42,479 --> 00:42:44,940
- Oh, put a cork in it, Kit.
- Is it... a wine pun?

900
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:47,317
That accidentally was a wine pun.

901
00:42:47,567 --> 00:42:48,652
Yes, it was.

902
00:42:48,777 --> 00:42:49,903
I'm Nick, by the way.

903
00:42:50,445 --> 00:42:51,529
Uh, Kirby.

904
00:42:52,614 --> 00:42:53,615
Jo.

905
00:42:54,324 --> 00:42:55,742
- Hey.
- Hey.

906
00:42:56,701 --> 00:42:58,119
Are you two a couple?

907
00:42:58,370 --> 00:42:59,371
- Yes.
- Yeah.

908
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:01,039
Kirby used to be my roommate.

909
00:43:01,248 --> 00:43:02,290
Cheers.

910
00:43:03,208 --> 00:43:04,251
Thanks.

911
00:43:05,627 --> 00:43:09,965
Well, I would like
to make a toast to Michael and Kit.

912
00:43:11,132 --> 00:43:16,012
You guys are such a great couple.
And you've been a huge inspiration to me.

913
00:43:16,429 --> 00:43:17,847
I mean, 13 years.

914
00:43:17,931 --> 00:43:21,017
It's an incredibly long time
for any couple to be together

915
00:43:21,101 --> 00:43:22,602
but especially for a gay couple.

916
00:43:22,686 --> 00:43:24,646
- Mmm.
- Right? I mean, in this day and age,

917
00:43:24,729 --> 00:43:27,315
it's, um, a really special thing.

918
00:43:27,399 --> 00:43:29,025
- I agree. So...
- And, even though

919
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:31,570
Nick and I have only
been together for...

920
00:43:31,736 --> 00:43:33,363
like, a couple weeks now...

921
00:43:33,446 --> 00:43:35,156
Three weeks, if you count texting.

922
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,533
Right. Three weeks.

923
00:43:37,033 --> 00:43:39,327
Um, I just...
I'm really hoping that we can follow

924
00:43:39,411 --> 00:43:42,831
in your wonderful example
of togetherness.

925
00:43:48,712 --> 00:43:50,797
Okay, I... Obviously, I've not told him.

926
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,048
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

927
00:43:52,132 --> 00:43:53,592
What's wrong?
Did I miss something?

928
00:43:54,092 --> 00:43:55,218
- Yes, you did.
- Yeah.

929
00:43:57,679 --> 00:43:58,763
What brings you here?

930
00:44:03,059 --> 00:44:04,311
- Um...
- You want to say that?

931
00:44:04,394 --> 00:44:05,395
Yeah. Uh...

932
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:09,065
Well, we've... been having a few...

933
00:44:09,649 --> 00:44:11,776
- minor problems.
- Problems. Yeah.

934
00:44:12,277 --> 00:44:19,075
For one thing, our sex life,
uh, leaves a little to be desired.

935
00:44:20,493 --> 00:44:23,413
By which Michael means
his clothes are dead-bolted to his body.

936
00:44:23,997 --> 00:44:27,584
He was on Grindr
during dinner with our friends,

937
00:44:27,792 --> 00:44:29,711
- and everyone saw.
- No one saw.

938
00:44:29,878 --> 00:44:31,379
I was on it for two seconds.

939
00:44:31,796 --> 00:44:34,049
Besides, that's our agreement.
Looking, but no touching.

940
00:44:34,299 --> 00:44:35,550
He is never not stoned.

941
00:44:35,634 --> 00:44:36,968
There's a corner of our bedroom

942
00:44:37,052 --> 00:44:38,637
that has started to look like
the pot version

943
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:39,930
of Walter White's meth lab.

944
00:44:40,013 --> 00:44:42,849
I ask him to join me, but he refuses.
You might actually enjoy it, Michael.

945
00:44:42,933 --> 00:44:45,685
He always asks me this,
and I always tell him the same thing,

946
00:44:45,769 --> 00:44:47,270
"Thanks, Cherry Garcia. I'm good."

947
00:44:47,354 --> 00:44:50,482
It's Jerry Garcia, not Cherry Garcia.
Cherry Garcia is a flavor of ice cream.

948
00:44:51,733 --> 00:44:52,734
Is that true?

949
00:44:52,984 --> 00:44:54,986
When I first met him,
he only drank Diet Coke,

950
00:44:55,278 --> 00:44:56,696
and now he drinks
a bottle of wine a night.

951
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:58,907
It relaxes me. It takes the edge off.
I think I've earned that.

952
00:44:58,990 --> 00:45:00,700
<i>By the time we've finished dinner
and started Drag Race,</i>

953
00:45:00,784 --> 00:45:02,077
he's well into his second bottle.

954
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,954
<i>Drag Race is only on Mondays.
It's a Monday show.</i>

955
00:45:04,037 --> 00:45:07,624
While I'm doing my bedtime routine,
he carries on drinking and watching TV.

956
00:45:07,707 --> 00:45:11,544
What he's not telling you is that
his bedtime routine lasts 90 minutes.

957
00:45:11,628 --> 00:45:13,255
- What's he doing?
- It's my alone time.

958
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:16,132
When Kit and I first started dating,
he didn't even own a television,

959
00:45:16,216 --> 00:45:18,051
and now I feel like
he watches more than I do.

960
00:45:18,134 --> 00:45:19,427
How would you know? You're never home.

961
00:45:19,511 --> 00:45:20,887
He never leaves the office,
which is weird.

962
00:45:20,971 --> 00:45:23,848
<i>And how hard can it possibly be
to recap an episode of Grey's Anatomy?</i>

963
00:45:23,932 --> 00:45:25,976
That is a deceptively complex show.

964
00:45:26,685 --> 00:45:27,686
Have you seen it?

965
00:45:28,019 --> 00:45:29,104
I, I know of it.

966
00:45:29,187 --> 00:45:31,314
He has an insane flirtation
with Tom Daley.

967
00:45:31,565 --> 00:45:32,691
The Olympic diver?

968
00:45:32,857 --> 00:45:34,568
His name's Sebastian,
and he's my coworker.

969
00:45:36,236 --> 00:45:38,071
- Hey, Claire.
- Hi, Michael.

970
00:45:38,154 --> 00:45:39,781
Let me just wrap up
these things, then we can...

971
00:45:40,615 --> 00:45:41,616
I'll do my best.

972
00:45:45,662 --> 00:45:47,247
<i>{\an8}Thomas Daley, Great Britain.</i>

973
00:45:47,664 --> 00:45:48,999
<i>- 8.5, 8.5...
- They charge by the hour.</i>

974
00:45:49,082 --> 00:45:50,292
I'm gonna go set up an invoice for them.

975
00:45:50,375 --> 00:45:51,376
Hey.

976
00:45:52,544 --> 00:45:54,838
I'm so sorry I missed the reception.
How did it go?

977
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:57,257
- Yeah. Yeah, it was good.
- Stupid cabbie.

978
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:00,427
Took the Manhattan Bridge when I told him,
"Take the tunnel."

979
00:46:00,969 --> 00:46:03,680
Well, you should've just taken it home,
because everyone's left already.

980
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:05,015
I'm sorry.

981
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:08,810
Why don't you go home and unpack,
and, you know, I'm just gonna stay here.

982
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,813
- You sure?
- Yeah.

983
00:46:12,856 --> 00:46:13,857
I'll see you at home.

984
00:46:14,608 --> 00:46:16,026
Okay. I'll see you later.

985
00:46:16,902 --> 00:46:18,612
<i>{\an8}Okay, fine.
He's Tom Daley's doppelgänger,</i>

986
00:46:18,695 --> 00:46:19,696
if you want to be technical about it.

987
00:46:19,779 --> 00:46:21,031
Are we not supposed to talk
to each other, Michael?

988
00:46:21,114 --> 00:46:22,407
I don't know
if that's all you're doing is talking.

989
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:23,491
I don't want to talk about this.

990
00:46:23,575 --> 00:46:25,994
You don't want to talk about anything.
He never talks about anything.

991
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:29,331
You sure?
You don't want to talk about it?

992
00:46:31,416 --> 00:46:33,585
<i>New Jersey police
recently arrested a man</i>

993
00:46:33,668 --> 00:46:36,212
<i>for bringing a doughnut
filled with Xanax pills</i>

994
00:46:36,463 --> 00:46:38,173
<i>to a local high school student...</i>

995
00:46:38,298 --> 00:46:39,382
Hey, you're still up.

996
00:46:44,429 --> 00:46:46,181
Must have had a lot of cleaning up to do.

997
00:46:46,264 --> 00:46:47,265
Yeah.

998
00:46:47,474 --> 00:46:49,267
Then a few of us went out
for a bite to eat after.

999
00:46:49,809 --> 00:46:50,810
Who all went?

1000
00:46:52,437 --> 00:46:53,939
Just the usual suspects.

1001
00:46:55,690 --> 00:46:58,026
- Was Sebastian there?
- Yes.

1002
00:46:58,401 --> 00:46:59,945
He was. Is that a problem?

1003
00:47:02,906 --> 00:47:04,616
I don't know. Is it?

1004
00:47:04,783 --> 00:47:06,034
I work with him, Michael.

1005
00:47:06,493 --> 00:47:08,119
Am I not allowed to go
to dinner with a coworker?

1006
00:47:08,203 --> 00:47:10,747
You know what, let me just... Forget it.

1007
00:47:12,707 --> 00:47:15,126
You're just gonna walk off?
That's not fair.

1008
00:47:15,669 --> 00:47:17,462
I'm the one that's being blown off,
and you're acting hurt

1009
00:47:17,545 --> 00:47:19,089
like you're the victim?
How is that fair?

1010
00:47:19,172 --> 00:47:21,258
- I said forget it. It's fine.
- No. It's not fine.

1011
00:47:21,341 --> 00:47:22,592
We don't need to
talk about this right now.

1012
00:47:22,676 --> 00:47:24,678
We do need to talk about it. There are
a lot of things we need to talk about.

1013
00:47:24,761 --> 00:47:26,263
It's not the first time
you haven't been there.

1014
00:47:26,429 --> 00:47:28,306
- It's happened a lot.
- And I apologize.

1015
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:31,268
I'm sorry I have deadlines,
but my readers depend upon me.

1016
00:47:31,393 --> 00:47:33,645
It's TV, Mike.
You're not saving the world.

1017
00:47:33,728 --> 00:47:35,146
- It's not art.
- What do you want me to say, Kit?

1018
00:47:35,272 --> 00:47:37,649
That I'm sorry I make money?
I'm sorry I have to travel

1019
00:47:37,732 --> 00:47:39,442
- in order to pay our mortgage?
- Okay, Mike.

1020
00:47:39,526 --> 00:47:41,570
And while I'm out there
working my ass off,

1021
00:47:41,653 --> 00:47:43,196
you're back here
doing God knows what

1022
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,408
with Nina and Sebastian,
going to, what, art openings?

1023
00:47:46,491 --> 00:47:48,535
Jerking each other off
over stupid side tables?

1024
00:47:48,618 --> 00:47:50,287
Yes, that is exactly what I do.

1025
00:47:53,707 --> 00:47:55,333
We're just in
very different worlds right now.

1026
00:47:57,002 --> 00:47:59,004
Yeah, we're in
very different world right now.

1027
00:47:59,296 --> 00:48:00,297
I agree.

1028
00:48:03,633 --> 00:48:05,093
So, you want to hear my assessment?

1029
00:48:05,385 --> 00:48:07,012
Yes. Absolutely.

1030
00:48:07,387 --> 00:48:08,972
I think you guys resent each other.

1031
00:48:10,432 --> 00:48:13,184
But you love each other too much
to part ways.

1032
00:48:15,562 --> 00:48:18,315
I think you may need to spend time apart

1033
00:48:19,399 --> 00:48:21,359
if you really want to come back together.

1034
00:48:24,988 --> 00:48:28,033
We're actually
currently living in separate apartments.

1035
00:48:28,783 --> 00:48:30,368
- I'm living here.
- And...

1036
00:48:30,452 --> 00:48:31,786
I have a place in Brooklyn.

1037
00:48:32,037 --> 00:48:33,330
I've been there. It's small.

1038
00:48:34,331 --> 00:48:36,249
But nice. But small.

1039
00:48:37,167 --> 00:48:39,294
- But nice.
- Nice.

1040
00:48:39,377 --> 00:48:40,837
So, you're broken up?

1041
00:48:41,087 --> 00:48:44,007
We're taking some time
to figure some things out.

1042
00:48:48,762 --> 00:48:50,764
But honestly,
to your wonderful togetherness.

1043
00:48:50,847 --> 00:48:52,849
Okay, let's eat.

1044
00:48:53,808 --> 00:48:55,936
- You put that down.
- Yes!

1045
00:48:56,019 --> 00:48:57,771
- Okay. Now, come back. Come dance.
- Okay. Dancing.

1046
00:48:57,854 --> 00:48:58,855
Yes!

1047
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:01,441
<i>Dig</i>

1048
00:49:09,407 --> 00:49:11,868
<i>The chills that you spill up my back</i>

1049
00:49:12,118 --> 00:49:14,913
<i>Keep me filled
with satisfaction when we're done</i>

1050
00:49:15,121 --> 00:49:16,873
<i>Satisfaction of what's to come</i>

1051
00:49:17,582 --> 00:49:20,168
<i>I couldn't ask for another</i>

1052
00:49:21,294 --> 00:49:23,922
<i>No, I couldn't ask for another</i>

1053
00:49:24,005 --> 00:49:25,173
<i>You know that's right</i>

1054
00:49:25,257 --> 00:49:27,133
<i>Your groove I do deeply dig</i>

1055
00:49:27,217 --> 00:49:29,219
<i>No walls, only the bridge...</i>

1056
00:49:29,302 --> 00:49:30,679
Hey, come dance.

1057
00:49:34,391 --> 00:49:35,642
Boring.

1058
00:49:40,855 --> 00:49:44,234
<i>No, I couldn't ask for another...</i>

1059
00:49:49,322 --> 00:49:51,074
- You guys, so fun.
- Thank you.

1060
00:49:51,157 --> 00:49:52,534
And I'm taking
a little cake for the road.

1061
00:49:52,617 --> 00:49:53,910
- Yes, I see.
- A little cake? Nick, Jesus.

1062
00:49:53,994 --> 00:49:55,120
- Just a little.
- A lot of cake.

1063
00:49:55,203 --> 00:49:57,205
- I'm so happy to have met you.
- I'm having people over tomorrow.

1064
00:49:57,289 --> 00:49:58,415
- You big bitch.
- Sorry.

1065
00:49:58,623 --> 00:50:00,834
- Good night.
- So much fun.

1066
00:50:01,001 --> 00:50:02,502
- See you soon.
- Seriously, this was so wonderful.

1067
00:50:02,586 --> 00:50:04,045
All right, thank you, queens.

1068
00:50:04,129 --> 00:50:05,589
- Thank you for being here.
- Bye. I love you.

1069
00:50:05,672 --> 00:50:07,007
- Happy holidays.
- Get home safe.

1070
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:08,800
- Love you. Bye, guys.
- Thanks again, really.

1071
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:10,260
Am I taking a cab or...

1072
00:50:10,343 --> 00:50:11,344
Bye.

1073
00:50:15,098 --> 00:50:16,099
That was a great party, Mike.

1074
00:50:16,349 --> 00:50:18,602
It was, right? It was really nice.

1075
00:50:21,187 --> 00:50:22,188
You okay?

1076
00:50:22,689 --> 00:50:23,690
Yeah. I'm good.

1077
00:50:24,107 --> 00:50:26,109
Are you still good
for Tony on Wednesday?

1078
00:50:26,359 --> 00:50:27,611
- Yeah, of course.
- Okay.

1079
00:50:28,904 --> 00:50:30,113
Did you want me to stay and help you

1080
00:50:30,196 --> 00:50:31,948
- with the cleaning and the...
- Oh, no. God, no. Please.

1081
00:50:32,032 --> 00:50:33,241
Thank you, though.

1082
00:50:34,618 --> 00:50:36,077
- Okay.
- Okay.

1083
00:50:40,206 --> 00:50:41,625
Kit, what is going on?

1084
00:50:42,167 --> 00:50:43,168
Are you all right?

1085
00:50:44,461 --> 00:50:46,630
There's something not right with my ass.

1086
00:50:46,713 --> 00:50:49,466
It feels like I've got
a golf ball lodged up there.

1087
00:50:49,633 --> 00:50:51,426
- A golf ball?
- Yeah.

1088
00:50:51,509 --> 00:50:53,136
It's probably just
a hemorrhoid or something.

1089
00:50:55,805 --> 00:50:57,223
Come down off the ledge, Mike.

1090
00:50:57,557 --> 00:50:59,726
I'm seeing a doctor tomorrow.
I've booked an appointment.

1091
00:51:01,144 --> 00:51:02,187
Will you tell me what they say?

1092
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:03,271
Of course.

1093
00:51:05,232 --> 00:51:06,233
Thank you.

1094
00:51:16,368 --> 00:51:17,369
Okay.

1095
00:51:18,328 --> 00:51:20,038
- Okay, bye!
- Bye!

1096
00:51:23,625 --> 00:51:24,626
Be safe.

1097
00:51:25,126 --> 00:51:26,127
I will.

1098
00:51:26,419 --> 00:51:27,504
Merry Christmas.

1099
00:51:38,473 --> 00:51:39,474
Okay.

1100
00:51:39,557 --> 00:51:41,059
- Michael.
- Kelly.

1101
00:51:41,142 --> 00:51:43,228
- It's so good to see you.
- It's so good to see you, too.

1102
00:51:43,311 --> 00:51:44,479
Thank you for coming here today.

1103
00:51:44,563 --> 00:51:45,689
- Absolutely.
- Yes. Really appreciate it.

1104
00:51:45,939 --> 00:51:47,607
<i>Congrats on the launch of TVLine.</i>

1105
00:51:47,691 --> 00:51:48,817
Oh. Thank you.

1106
00:51:48,984 --> 00:51:50,485
You look incredible, by the way.

1107
00:51:50,569 --> 00:51:51,736
Thank you.

1108
00:51:52,028 --> 00:51:53,280
You... Ooh. Kelly.

1109
00:51:53,446 --> 00:51:55,865
I need to take this
real quick before we start.

1110
00:51:55,949 --> 00:51:57,033
- Okay.
- I'm sorry about that.

1111
00:51:57,117 --> 00:51:58,326
- I'll be right back.
- Okay, cool.

1112
00:51:59,786 --> 00:52:00,787
Hey. What happened?

1113
00:52:01,037 --> 00:52:02,372
<i>They found a growth.</i>

1114
00:52:02,956 --> 00:52:04,624
Wait... What do you mean?

1115
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:05,875
<i>They found a growth in my butt.</i>

1116
00:52:05,959 --> 00:52:07,586
<i>But the doctor said
there are a hundred things</i>

1117
00:52:07,669 --> 00:52:08,670
<i>it could be besides cancer.</i>

1118
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:11,006
I'm having it biopsied on Friday.

1119
00:52:12,257 --> 00:52:14,050
<i>Please, don't worry about it, Michael,
I'm not.</i>

1120
00:52:14,426 --> 00:52:16,094
I got to go.
I've got to get on the subway.

1121
00:52:16,928 --> 00:52:18,638
Kit, wait.

1122
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:25,395
So, Michael, how was school today?

1123
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:28,231
It was okay.

1124
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:32,819
We had to pick teams in gym class,
and they picked me last.

1125
00:52:38,491 --> 00:52:40,952
- Are you okay, Mom?
- Totally fine.

1126
00:52:42,704 --> 00:52:44,456
I just need to make
an appointment with the doctor.

1127
00:52:47,792 --> 00:52:49,878
Yes. Okay, Doctor. Yes.

1128
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:52,422
Thank you, Doctor.
I'll look at the test results.

1129
00:52:56,343 --> 00:52:58,887
Hey, turd ball,
there's a matter baby on your chair.

1130
00:52:59,262 --> 00:53:00,847
What's a matter baby?

1131
00:53:01,097 --> 00:53:03,725
Nothing.
What's the matter with you, baby?

1132
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:16,821
Confirm your name
and birth date for me, please.

1133
00:53:17,322 --> 00:53:20,075
Christopher Cowan. December 23, 1972.

1134
00:53:22,661 --> 00:53:23,703
Allergies?

1135
00:53:23,954 --> 00:53:25,789
Hot yoga, shareable plates.

1136
00:53:28,625 --> 00:53:29,626
Penicillin.

1137
00:53:34,839 --> 00:53:37,217
And what's your relationship
to the patient?

1138
00:53:40,929 --> 00:53:41,972
The plan is to get in there

1139
00:53:42,055 --> 00:53:44,099
and take a piece of it
and send it of for testing.

1140
00:53:44,432 --> 00:53:46,643
There's a chance that you'll go in,
you'll find out it's nothing,

1141
00:53:46,726 --> 00:53:49,604
- and then we'll just move on from...
- Michael, relax. Everything's fine.

1142
00:53:49,688 --> 00:53:50,897
I'm gonna be fine, okay?

1143
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:54,025
I'll come out
and talk to you right after I'm done.

1144
00:54:36,610 --> 00:54:37,611
Michael?

1145
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:39,946
I'm concerned about Christopher.

1146
00:54:40,947 --> 00:54:43,158
The growth was a lot bigger
than I anticipated.

1147
00:54:43,241 --> 00:54:44,242
So it's cancer?

1148
00:54:44,326 --> 00:54:45,785
It's basically...
It's definitely cancer?

1149
00:54:45,869 --> 00:54:47,329
We won't know
until the results come back,

1150
00:54:47,412 --> 00:54:49,915
but whatever it is,
I promise you we'll treat it.

1151
00:54:51,875 --> 00:54:53,543
Oh, my God.

1152
00:54:59,132 --> 00:55:00,216
Where's my camera?

1153
00:55:00,592 --> 00:55:02,218
It's probably in Brooklyn.

1154
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:05,138
<i>We're missing Drag Race.</i>

1155
00:55:05,722 --> 00:55:07,015
It's Wednesday, Kit.

1156
00:55:10,936 --> 00:55:14,606
Okay. Look, I want you
to stay with me for a couple of days.

1157
00:55:14,773 --> 00:55:16,483
You can stay here. I want you to.

1158
00:55:16,608 --> 00:55:18,401
Obviously. I live with you, Mike.

1159
00:55:18,985 --> 00:55:20,278
Actually, you don't.

1160
00:55:51,977 --> 00:55:53,395
Hey, Michael. How you doing?

1161
00:55:53,478 --> 00:55:54,521
- Hi, Paige. How are you?
- Good, good.

1162
00:55:54,854 --> 00:55:56,439
All right, so you have
a quick window with Candace

1163
00:55:56,523 --> 00:55:58,149
before they set up
for the next shot. That's fine.

1164
00:55:58,233 --> 00:55:59,401
- Thank you very much.
- Let me go grab her.

1165
00:55:59,484 --> 00:56:00,860
There she is.

1166
00:56:01,861 --> 00:56:02,862
Hey, Candace.

1167
00:56:03,738 --> 00:56:05,782
We're all ready for you.
Come on over.

1168
00:56:09,494 --> 00:56:11,580
This way.
Think he's waiting for you,

1169
00:56:11,663 --> 00:56:13,373
and you have a very limited
amount of time.

1170
00:56:13,456 --> 00:56:14,791
Thank you so much. Hi, Michael.

1171
00:56:14,958 --> 00:56:16,876
- Hey, Candace.
- We've got literally five minutes.

1172
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,336
- Great. Okay.
- Thank you.

1173
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:19,504
- Hi, Dylan.
- Hi.

1174
00:56:20,088 --> 00:56:21,673
- Okay.
- Okay.

1175
00:56:30,348 --> 00:56:32,517
Hey, honey, I'm cancer.
I mean, I'm home.

1176
00:56:33,602 --> 00:56:34,895
That's not funny, Kit.

1177
00:56:35,145 --> 00:56:36,187
Yeah, I know.

1178
00:56:39,482 --> 00:56:40,609
Hey.

1179
00:56:42,027 --> 00:56:43,653
- Hi.
- What are you doing?

1180
00:56:44,571 --> 00:56:45,572
Did you google it?

1181
00:56:45,655 --> 00:56:46,990
Of course I googled it.

1182
00:56:47,073 --> 00:56:48,575
- I asked you not to, Mike.
- Well...

1183
00:56:48,658 --> 00:56:50,160
The Internet just tells you
you're gonna die.

1184
00:56:50,452 --> 00:56:52,287
And you're not a doctor,
so you won't understand anyway.

1185
00:56:52,621 --> 00:56:54,623
This isn't exactly
my first run-in with cancer, Kit.

1186
00:56:54,706 --> 00:56:56,499
Exactly. I don't want this
to freak you out.

1187
00:56:57,751 --> 00:57:00,837
And I don't want to jump to conclusions,
so please, hold off.

1188
00:57:01,755 --> 00:57:05,050
I found the names of who are apparently
the best oncologists in New York,

1189
00:57:05,133 --> 00:57:06,635
and I already made appointments with them.

1190
00:57:06,885 --> 00:57:09,679
- They're for next week.
- I don't want to drag you through this.

1191
00:57:12,223 --> 00:57:13,934
We don't even know
where we are right now...

1192
00:57:14,017 --> 00:57:15,435
I don't care
where we are right now.

1193
00:57:16,228 --> 00:57:18,897
I'm not letting you go through this alone.
You don't get a choice in that matter.

1194
00:57:19,564 --> 00:57:22,484
And you should stay here this week.
All these doctors are in Manhattan.

1195
00:57:22,901 --> 00:57:25,403
Perfectly healthy people
have died waiting on the L Train.

1196
00:57:31,701 --> 00:57:32,786
I'm scared.

1197
00:57:37,249 --> 00:57:38,250
I'm scared, too.

1198
00:57:39,709 --> 00:57:40,835
Generally speaking,

1199
00:57:40,919 --> 00:57:43,922
rectal cancer is fairly common
and highly treatable.

1200
00:57:44,214 --> 00:57:45,840
Christopher, I was telling
your brother when...

1201
00:57:45,924 --> 00:57:47,050
No, no, no. I'm not his brother.

1202
00:57:47,259 --> 00:57:50,762
Oh, sorry.
Uh, there are multiple nodules

1203
00:57:50,845 --> 00:57:53,723
adjacent to the inferior rectum
which are presumably related

1204
00:57:53,807 --> 00:57:55,600
to the neuroendocrine tumor
that was biopsied.

1205
00:57:55,934 --> 00:57:57,143
Well, you sound optimistic.

1206
00:57:57,435 --> 00:57:59,646
There's definitely room
for optimism here.

1207
00:57:59,729 --> 00:58:01,231
With a neuroendocrine tumor,

1208
00:58:01,356 --> 00:58:03,858
particularly with what I see
in the pathology report,

1209
00:58:04,276 --> 00:58:06,111
it's very amenable to therapy.

1210
00:58:06,278 --> 00:58:07,988
So this is not one of
the more aggressive ones?

1211
00:58:08,238 --> 00:58:11,825
Correct.
Neuroendocrine tumors are not aggressive.

1212
00:58:12,117 --> 00:58:13,868
So, take a deep breath.

1213
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:16,204
<i>It was beginning to seem like</i>

1214
00:58:16,288 --> 00:58:19,124
<i>we might dodge
a worst-case cancer diagnosis.</i>

1215
00:58:19,457 --> 00:58:22,294
<i>And as if to seal the deal,
our final doctor looked like</i>

1216
00:58:22,377 --> 00:58:24,212
<i>she stepped straight out
of hair and makeup</i>

1217
00:58:24,296 --> 00:58:26,131
<i>and onto the set of a TV show.</i>

1218
00:58:26,548 --> 00:58:27,549
<i>A good one.</i>

1219
00:58:28,091 --> 00:58:29,134
<i>I was in love with her.</i>

1220
00:58:31,177 --> 00:58:32,512
<i>Until she opened her mouth.</i>

1221
00:58:33,054 --> 00:58:36,558
You have an extremely aggressive form
of neuroendocrine cancer.

1222
00:58:37,809 --> 00:58:40,186
Your tumor is what we call high-grade.

1223
00:58:40,645 --> 00:58:41,646
I'm sorry, what?

1224
00:58:41,730 --> 00:58:44,983
If you decide to get your treatment here,
I would like to start as soon as possible.

1225
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:47,360
The other doctors that we talked to,

1226
00:58:47,444 --> 00:58:49,446
they said that
this wasn't the aggressive kind.

1227
00:58:49,613 --> 00:58:50,697
And they're wrong.

1228
00:58:51,364 --> 00:58:53,658
And his is already
at a very advanced stage.

1229
00:58:54,367 --> 00:58:55,368
What stage are we talking?

1230
00:58:55,994 --> 00:58:56,995
Stage four.

1231
00:58:59,664 --> 00:59:00,790
I'm sorry.

1232
00:59:08,798 --> 00:59:10,717
How soon should he start treatment?

1233
00:59:11,801 --> 00:59:15,347
Ideally, Monday, uh,
he would start chemotherapy.

1234
00:59:16,848 --> 00:59:17,849
I need a minute.

1235
00:59:53,718 --> 00:59:54,719
This good?

1236
00:59:56,304 --> 00:59:57,806
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1237
01:00:11,403 --> 01:00:12,404
What are you gonna get?

1238
01:00:13,154 --> 01:00:14,406
What I always get.

1239
01:00:16,116 --> 01:00:17,158
Okay.

1240
01:00:19,244 --> 01:00:20,662
Here you go. You ready?

1241
01:00:20,745 --> 01:00:22,664
Yeah. I'll do the steak tacos.

1242
01:00:23,081 --> 01:00:24,874
- Okay.
- Can I get a Diet Coke, please?

1243
01:00:24,958 --> 01:00:26,585
- Sure.
- Thank you.

1244
01:00:26,668 --> 01:00:27,669
Ooh...

1245
01:00:32,549 --> 01:00:34,342
Have you talked to your mom lately?

1246
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:37,304
- No.
- Because she keeps calling me.

1247
01:00:37,554 --> 01:00:38,763
And I'm running out of excuses

1248
01:00:38,847 --> 01:00:40,599
of where you are
and why you can't talk to her.

1249
01:00:40,682 --> 01:00:43,351
And I think she's getting worried.

1250
01:00:44,519 --> 01:00:46,521
She doesn't even know
we're not living together.

1251
01:00:47,647 --> 01:00:49,816
I think maybe we should
drive down there this weekend.

1252
01:00:51,192 --> 01:00:52,444
I'm not ready to tell them.

1253
01:00:54,070 --> 01:00:55,280
I think we have to.

1254
01:01:04,998 --> 01:01:06,374
I love this song.

1255
01:01:17,344 --> 01:01:18,345
What?

1256
01:01:19,095 --> 01:01:20,180
What?

1257
01:01:21,348 --> 01:01:22,807
You're looking at me.

1258
01:02:33,795 --> 01:02:37,882
<i>Lay me down</i>

1259
01:02:37,966 --> 01:02:42,345
<i>Lay me down</i>

1260
01:02:42,429 --> 01:02:46,850
<i>Lay me down</i>

1261
01:02:46,933 --> 01:02:50,270
<i>Lay me down</i>

1262
01:02:50,353 --> 01:02:54,357
<i>Lay me down</i>

1263
01:02:54,441 --> 01:02:58,862
<i>Lay me down</i>

1264
01:02:58,945 --> 01:03:02,866
<i>Lay me down</i>

1265
01:03:02,949 --> 01:03:06,077
<i>Lay me down.</i>

1266
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:13,001
Mom.

1267
01:03:13,835 --> 01:03:15,921
- Ah! They're here.
- Hi.

1268
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:17,714
Hi.

1269
01:03:17,964 --> 01:03:19,299
Yay!

1270
01:03:19,382 --> 01:03:21,509
- Hi, Marilyn. Hi.
- Hi, Michael. Hi.

1271
01:03:21,593 --> 01:03:23,261
- It's good to see you.
- Oh, come in, come in.

1272
01:03:23,345 --> 01:03:24,971
- How was the drive?
- Oh, it was good.

1273
01:03:25,055 --> 01:03:26,514
- Yeah, it was fine.
- You know, long as usual,

1274
01:03:26,598 --> 01:03:28,183
- but I like making it.
- Mom.

1275
01:03:28,266 --> 01:03:29,351
- Your hair, it's nice.
- Oh!

1276
01:03:29,517 --> 01:03:31,186
- It got so gray. I don't know.
- It's got volume and bounce.

1277
01:03:31,269 --> 01:03:32,437
- It's pretty.
- Do you think

1278
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:33,730
- I should color it?
- No, I love the color.

1279
01:03:33,813 --> 01:03:34,856
It's beautiful.
Something smells delicious.

1280
01:03:34,940 --> 01:03:37,442
Don't you touch that!
I'm cooking something.

1281
01:03:37,525 --> 01:03:39,194
- Wait. Wait. Bob!
- Okay.

1282
01:03:39,527 --> 01:03:40,695
The boys are here!

1283
01:03:40,779 --> 01:03:41,780
- I'm coming!
- Come...

1284
01:03:41,863 --> 01:03:43,698
Come grab their bags, will you?

1285
01:03:43,782 --> 01:03:44,866
I'm just gonna take the bag.
It's fine.

1286
01:03:44,950 --> 01:03:46,660
You boys must be starving.
Are you starving?

1287
01:03:46,743 --> 01:03:47,869
- I'm okay.
- I can make you snacks.

1288
01:03:47,953 --> 01:03:49,037
No, I was just checking the fridge.

1289
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:50,455
We got some sandwiches
at the gas station, so...

1290
01:03:50,622 --> 01:03:52,332
- From a gas station?
- They were fine.

1291
01:03:52,415 --> 01:03:53,917
You can't eat sandwiches
that come from a gas station.

1292
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,585
We didn't want to spend
much time in the...

1293
01:03:55,835 --> 01:03:57,504
- It was easy.
- Oh, for... Bob!

1294
01:03:57,587 --> 01:03:59,005
- Come on and get their bags!
- Mom.

1295
01:03:59,089 --> 01:04:00,507
- Come on. They're here.
- I'm coming, Mare!

1296
01:04:00,590 --> 01:04:01,591
He hears you. He's coming.

1297
01:04:01,675 --> 01:04:04,427
Why didn't you just give me
some time to clean up?

1298
01:04:04,511 --> 01:04:05,762
- You say you're on your way.
- It's clean.

1299
01:04:05,845 --> 01:04:07,097
You just have to give me just a little bit

1300
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:08,306
- of notice, you know.
- It's fine.

1301
01:04:08,390 --> 01:04:09,849
Well, look what
the cat dragged in.

1302
01:04:09,975 --> 01:04:12,185
- Hello, you handsome devil.
- Hey, Dad.

1303
01:04:12,269 --> 01:04:13,436
Hi, Kitty. How are you?
How are you?

1304
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:14,938
- Good to see you.
- How are you? Good to see you.

1305
01:04:15,188 --> 01:04:16,565
- Hey, Bob.
- Equally handsome devil.

1306
01:04:16,648 --> 01:04:18,191
- Thank you very much.
- Hello!

1307
01:04:18,275 --> 01:04:20,902
- Michael, I love this coat.
- Thank you.

1308
01:04:20,986 --> 01:04:22,737
Is it camel hair? Because I'm hearing

1309
01:04:22,821 --> 01:04:25,407
that camel hair is very...
is big this season.

1310
01:04:25,532 --> 01:04:26,825
- I think it...
- Camel hair?

1311
01:04:26,908 --> 01:04:28,785
You wouldn't know camel hair
from a hole in the ground.

1312
01:04:28,868 --> 01:04:30,370
- I have some style.
- What do you mean, camel hair?

1313
01:04:30,495 --> 01:04:31,830
- You do, Bob. You have style.
- Style?

1314
01:04:31,913 --> 01:04:33,415
- Thank you, Michael.
- Look at you. My God.

1315
01:04:33,498 --> 01:04:35,166
- And you wear it well.
- Totally cisgender.

1316
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:36,251
Dad, let me help you with those bags.

1317
01:04:36,334 --> 01:04:38,795
The last coat you got was from JCPenney,
for goodness' sakes.

1318
01:04:39,004 --> 01:04:41,047
Like, a camera situated
right on the runway.

1319
01:04:41,131 --> 01:04:42,716
See? You can see there.
And then...

1320
01:04:42,882 --> 01:04:46,469
I mean, you can just watch planes
take off and land all day long.

1321
01:04:46,553 --> 01:04:48,388
- Oh, look at that.
- Which he does.

1322
01:04:48,638 --> 01:04:50,765
- Mare, I do not.
- You do, too.

1323
01:04:51,016 --> 01:04:52,809
Well, I mean, it is in real time.

1324
01:04:53,018 --> 01:04:56,605
Look, it's... the little Cessna CTT.

1325
01:04:56,688 --> 01:04:58,189
- Very nice.
- Hold out... Hold out your arm.

1326
01:04:58,273 --> 01:05:01,359
He's not high-style
like a... like a Learjet.

1327
01:05:01,443 --> 01:05:02,652
- You're knitting me a sweater.
- Right.

1328
01:05:04,613 --> 01:05:07,365
Last week was this great,
big race in Toledo.

1329
01:05:07,449 --> 01:05:09,826
Which is a really nice town.
I'd never been before.

1330
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:13,455
It's known for glass factories,
but who knows if that's actually true?

1331
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:16,124
Listen, you boys should come one year.
It's so much fun.

1332
01:05:16,207 --> 01:05:19,836
- They take over the whole town, too.
- We take over the whole town.

1333
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,671
- Go ahead, Mare.
- Anyway, this woman I know,

1334
01:05:21,755 --> 01:05:22,756
Trish O'Neil,

1335
01:05:22,839 --> 01:05:24,925
who won the race,
she's in my age-group, but...

1336
01:05:25,008 --> 01:05:27,218
- Wins races all the time.
- So, the race starts.

1337
01:05:27,385 --> 01:05:30,430
I saw her for the first
five miles of the bike ride,

1338
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:33,475
'cause she and I
were riding fairly close together.

1339
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:36,978
And then after that,
she just kind of disappears.

1340
01:05:37,562 --> 01:05:39,689
I don't see her
the whole rest of the race.

1341
01:05:39,773 --> 01:05:41,942
Did you like the rosé, Michael? Is it...

1342
01:05:42,025 --> 01:05:43,318
- Oh, yes, I love this.
- Good.

1343
01:05:43,401 --> 01:05:45,028
I love all rosé,
but this is very good.

1344
01:05:45,111 --> 01:05:46,696
Last mile of the race...

1345
01:05:48,406 --> 01:05:50,325
Da-dum! She reappears.

1346
01:05:50,492 --> 01:05:52,452
- She cheated.
- You know, with not one single

1347
01:05:52,535 --> 01:05:56,414
drop of sweat on her,
she just trots across the finish line,

1348
01:05:56,581 --> 01:05:57,707
- the winner!
- Yeah.

1349
01:05:59,668 --> 01:06:01,544
And we were all very upset.

1350
01:06:05,257 --> 01:06:07,676
So...
You know what, we have been talking

1351
01:06:07,759 --> 01:06:09,302
- a blue streak...
- No.

1352
01:06:09,386 --> 01:06:10,845
Ever since you guys got here.

1353
01:06:10,929 --> 01:06:12,347
- Yeah, so... so...
- Wonderful.

1354
01:06:14,015 --> 01:06:16,184
Honestly, what's going on with you guys?

1355
01:06:18,728 --> 01:06:19,938
Um...

1356
01:06:28,029 --> 01:06:29,281
I don't know where to start.

1357
01:06:31,783 --> 01:06:33,785
Uh, about
two or three months ago,

1358
01:06:35,245 --> 01:06:40,250
I started experiencing a lot of pain
when going to the bathroom...

1359
01:06:41,126 --> 01:06:42,377
And...

1360
01:06:47,882 --> 01:06:50,385
We thought
there were a lot of things it could be.

1361
01:06:50,510 --> 01:06:52,512
How many doctors have you seen?

1362
01:06:52,637 --> 01:06:54,264
We saw three.

1363
01:06:54,347 --> 01:06:56,266
<i>It was the longest
20 minutes of my life.</i>

1364
01:06:59,769 --> 01:07:01,897
<i>I'll never forget how brave
you were telling them.</i>

1365
01:07:10,739 --> 01:07:12,240
Obviously, you're gonna fight it.

1366
01:07:14,618 --> 01:07:15,869
And you'll beat it.

1367
01:07:19,205 --> 01:07:20,290
Yeah.

1368
01:07:20,373 --> 01:07:22,459
Who wants cake? It's flourless.

1369
01:07:23,084 --> 01:07:24,085
I'd love cake.

1370
01:07:24,169 --> 01:07:26,588
- Here, let me do it. It's all right.
- Thank you.

1371
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:28,924
I'll just... Okay.

1372
01:07:29,174 --> 01:07:30,175
Here.

1373
01:07:45,857 --> 01:07:48,860
I didn't sleep
one wink last night.

1374
01:07:48,944 --> 01:07:53,198
Not one single wink.
Everything kept rolling around in my head.

1375
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:56,368
- Just racing around and around.
- I felt the same.

1376
01:07:56,701 --> 01:07:58,411
I kept thinking about Trish.

1377
01:07:58,994 --> 01:07:59,996
Oh.

1378
01:08:00,538 --> 01:08:02,873
- Right.
- I mean, it's just so insulting.

1379
01:08:02,958 --> 01:08:03,958
- Right.
- Like a...

1380
01:08:04,042 --> 01:08:06,670
like a big middle finger
to the rest of us.

1381
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:09,005
I mean, there we are,
pushing ourselves

1382
01:08:09,088 --> 01:08:11,716
as hard as we can,
and honestly...

1383
01:08:11,925 --> 01:08:13,885
Honestly, for what?

1384
01:08:14,177 --> 01:08:15,262
For what?

1385
01:08:15,387 --> 01:08:16,554
I don't know. For what?

1386
01:08:16,846 --> 01:08:19,015
Just to see if we can.

1387
01:08:19,349 --> 01:08:21,434
- Oh, sure. Yeah, that.
- If we can do it.

1388
01:08:21,643 --> 01:08:24,521
I mean, there's no glory in it.
There's certainly no money in it.

1389
01:08:24,604 --> 01:08:26,565
It's killing my knees.

1390
01:08:26,648 --> 01:08:28,233
But I just do it.

1391
01:08:28,315 --> 01:08:29,568
Well, you should
take it easy on your knees.

1392
01:08:29,650 --> 01:08:31,319
And then someone
like Trish shows up,

1393
01:08:31,403 --> 01:08:33,029
who hasn't got a clue. She...

1394
01:08:33,113 --> 01:08:35,657
Honestly, what race
does she think she's running?

1395
01:08:35,739 --> 01:08:37,951
She thinks
she can just bypass all the hard parts?

1396
01:08:38,034 --> 01:08:41,079
Well, you can't.
You have to run the race in front of you,

1397
01:08:41,162 --> 01:08:42,706
because that's all there is.

1398
01:08:42,872 --> 01:08:44,498
- Marilyn, do you want to...
- You do the best you can.

1399
01:08:44,583 --> 01:08:48,587
But she thinks...
She thinks you can cheat all of that.

1400
01:08:48,670 --> 01:08:51,381
And I'm here to tell you,
if you cheat, you're going to get caught.

1401
01:08:51,463 --> 01:08:53,592
I'm not gonna sit around
and let her get away with it.

1402
01:08:53,675 --> 01:08:55,467
No, siree, bobtail.

1403
01:08:59,431 --> 01:09:01,683
So, how big is your freezer exactly?

1404
01:09:01,766 --> 01:09:03,976
I mean, is it the kind
with the drawer that pulls out,

1405
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:07,063
or with the skinny door on the side?

1406
01:09:07,271 --> 01:09:09,482
Oh, we have
the drawer that pulls out.

1407
01:09:09,690 --> 01:09:10,775
Good. Good.

1408
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:15,822
I'm thinking I'm gonna make
a whole lot of soup for the both of you.

1409
01:09:16,114 --> 01:09:17,114
- And I'll...
- Oh.

1410
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:19,199
I'll send it to you,
and you can freeze it.

1411
01:09:19,701 --> 01:09:22,037
I'm sure FedEx does that kind of thing.

1412
01:09:22,119 --> 01:09:23,913
That's very nice of you. Thank you.

1413
01:09:24,456 --> 01:09:26,333
He needs to keep eating, Michael.

1414
01:09:27,667 --> 01:09:30,420
- Yes, definitely. He does.
- And so do you.

1415
01:09:31,922 --> 01:09:32,923
Yeah.

1416
01:10:08,583 --> 01:10:10,669
Hi, Mom. I'm home.

1417
01:10:21,972 --> 01:10:24,432
Mom? Mom?

1418
01:10:26,810 --> 01:10:27,852
Mom?

1419
01:10:41,449 --> 01:10:43,451
<i>Previously on Dawn to Dusk...</i>

1420
01:10:44,869 --> 01:10:46,454
Apologies for the wait.

1421
01:10:46,955 --> 01:10:48,540
Uh, how was your commute today?

1422
01:10:48,915 --> 01:10:51,459
Uh, it was fine.
We just came from downtown.

1423
01:11:08,393 --> 01:11:11,146
All right. Christopher, you are all set.

1424
01:11:11,813 --> 01:11:14,858
So, today you'll be getting
your first cycle of cisplatin

1425
01:11:14,941 --> 01:11:16,359
- and etoposide.
- What is this?

1426
01:11:17,402 --> 01:11:19,070
It's an infusion chair.

1427
01:11:19,321 --> 01:11:20,947
No, no, no, no, no.
We were promised a bed.

1428
01:11:21,823 --> 01:11:24,200
The recliners go all the way back.
They're really comfortable.

1429
01:11:24,326 --> 01:11:26,036
- Mike, it's fine. It's fine.
- No, it's not fine.

1430
01:11:26,119 --> 01:11:28,288
He can't sit for four hours.
It's excruciatingly painful.

1431
01:11:28,371 --> 01:11:30,081
- He needs a bed. We were promised a bed.
- Michael.

1432
01:11:30,165 --> 01:11:31,833
I'm so sorry,
but we don't have any beds today.

1433
01:11:31,917 --> 01:11:33,251
- Okay. This is not...
- It's okay. It's fine.

1434
01:11:33,335 --> 01:11:34,336
Thanks.

1435
01:11:34,628 --> 01:11:36,379
I'll just sit on my side,
or I can... It'll be all right.

1436
01:11:36,504 --> 01:11:37,964
You're not gonna sit
on your side the whole time.

1437
01:11:38,048 --> 01:11:39,174
Don't sit.

1438
01:11:42,594 --> 01:11:43,595
Hey.

1439
01:11:44,638 --> 01:11:46,348
Give my husband a bed.

1440
01:11:46,598 --> 01:11:47,641
Sir, I'm afraid we don't...

1441
01:11:47,724 --> 01:11:49,768
He has a rectal tumor
the size of the Death Star.

1442
01:11:49,851 --> 01:11:52,187
He needs a bed.
We were promised a bed.

1443
01:11:52,270 --> 01:11:53,355
All the beds are occupied, sir.

1444
01:11:53,438 --> 01:11:55,440
I don't care where
you have to go and find one!

1445
01:11:55,523 --> 01:11:57,609
I don't care if you
have to drive to IKEA and buy one.

1446
01:11:57,734 --> 01:11:59,694
I don't care if you have
to go to Jennifer Convertibles!

1447
01:11:59,778 --> 01:12:01,321
Give my husband a bed!

1448
01:12:02,697 --> 01:12:03,698
Okay, sir.

1449
01:12:04,074 --> 01:12:05,200
Okay.

1450
01:12:06,076 --> 01:12:07,244
We'll find your husband a bed.

1451
01:12:08,870 --> 01:12:10,121
Thank you.

1452
01:12:21,383 --> 01:12:22,759
Well, that was Oscar-worthy.

1453
01:12:22,884 --> 01:12:24,511
It worked for Shirley MacLaine.

1454
01:12:25,053 --> 01:12:27,138
I think the "husband" detail
really swung it for you.

1455
01:12:27,472 --> 01:12:29,557
Well, "boyfriend"
didn't seem dramatic enough.

1456
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:32,686
- Is this how you are at work?
- I'm a top at work.

1457
01:12:32,769 --> 01:12:33,937
Michael.

1458
01:12:35,981 --> 01:12:37,023
Well, thank you.

1459
01:12:44,906 --> 01:12:45,949
Mike.

1460
01:12:47,993 --> 01:12:49,369
What do you need? What's wrong?

1461
01:12:50,662 --> 01:12:51,663
What are you doing?

1462
01:12:53,957 --> 01:12:55,208
No.

1463
01:12:55,584 --> 01:12:58,670
Kit. Oh, my God.

1464
01:12:58,753 --> 01:13:00,255
Look at that.

1465
01:13:00,338 --> 01:13:02,549
- It's happening.
- It's happening.

1466
01:13:02,924 --> 01:13:05,218
<i>Wish I could write songs about</i>

1467
01:13:05,302 --> 01:13:09,097
<i>Anything other than death</i>

1468
01:13:12,767 --> 01:13:17,230
<i>But I can't go to bed
without drawing the red</i>

1469
01:13:17,856 --> 01:13:19,816
<i>Shaving off breaths...</i>

1470
01:13:20,066 --> 01:13:21,610
I'm afraid the news isn't good.

1471
01:13:23,236 --> 01:13:25,447
Your body isn't responding to the chemo.

1472
01:13:25,739 --> 01:13:27,365
The tumor has grown.

1473
01:13:27,574 --> 01:13:29,910
And we also found
nodules in the pelvic region.

1474
01:13:35,582 --> 01:13:37,375
Kit. You... Oh, my God.

1475
01:13:38,835 --> 01:13:40,295
What... Are you okay?

1476
01:13:40,378 --> 01:13:42,297
Jesus Christ. Kit.

1477
01:13:42,505 --> 01:13:44,007
Here. Here. Here. Here.

1478
01:13:44,090 --> 01:13:46,259
Take it. Hold that. There you go.

1479
01:13:46,718 --> 01:13:48,261
Breathe, baby.

1480
01:13:48,345 --> 01:13:50,013
Just breathe. Just breathe.

1481
01:13:50,096 --> 01:13:51,389
Breathe.

1482
01:14:03,860 --> 01:14:05,028
It's passing.

1483
01:14:05,362 --> 01:14:06,738
- It's passing?
- Yeah.

1484
01:14:07,113 --> 01:14:11,660
<i>Whenever I'm alone with you can't talk</i>

1485
01:14:11,910 --> 01:14:16,206

1486
01:14:16,748 --> 01:14:21,419
<i>Should I go somewhere else

1487

01:14:37,352 --> 01:14:42,566
<i>A marathon runner

1490
01:14:52,242 --> 01:14:53,702
We're gonna stop chemo.

1491
01:14:54,411 --> 01:14:55,954
Take a short break in your treatment

1492
01:14:56,037 --> 01:14:57,914
so you have time
to get your strength back.

1493
01:14:59,291 --> 01:15:01,376
Then we'll start a course of radiation.
Five days a week.

1494
01:15:02,335 --> 01:15:03,545
It's proven effective in some cases.

1495
01:15:03,628 --> 01:15:04,963
It could buy us some time.

1496
01:15:26,109 --> 01:15:27,944
- Hey.
- Sebastian! Hey.

1497
01:15:30,322 --> 01:15:32,073
I invited some people from work.

1498
01:15:32,782 --> 01:15:34,034
Oh, thanks.

1499
01:15:34,367 --> 01:15:37,287
<i>- You're all my legendary children.

1500
01:15:37,370 --> 01:15:38,413

Does this mean a drive-in?

1508
01:16:09,194 --> 01:16:12,030
Okay.
Give me my bag. I'll take it.

1509
01:16:13,698 --> 01:16:15,617
- Somebody get the gate this time.
- Come on.

1510
01:16:16,993 --> 01:16:18,370
This is lovely.

1511
01:16:19,871 --> 01:16:20,956
Okay.

1512
01:16:21,289 --> 01:16:23,166
- Oh, my goodness.
- Beautiful.

1513
01:16:23,291 --> 01:16:26,002
Really lovely. My, my.

1514
01:16:28,421 --> 01:16:29,798
It's down at the end.

1515
01:16:29,881 --> 01:16:31,466
- Okay. I see it.
- Bob!

1516
01:16:31,591 --> 01:16:33,260
- What?
- Slow down.

1517
01:16:33,510 --> 01:16:34,844
- This is it.
- Is this ours?

1518
01:16:34,970 --> 01:16:36,930
Yes,
and we're right next to you.

1519
01:16:37,055 --> 01:16:39,015
- Guys...
- Who's got the key?

1520
01:16:39,099 --> 01:16:41,393
You don't need a key.
I think it's supposed to be open.

1521
01:16:41,476 --> 01:16:42,852
That seems dangerous.

1522
01:16:42,936 --> 01:16:43,937
Okay.

1523
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:47,607
No, I do not have the strength
to carry you across this threshold.

1524
01:16:47,732 --> 01:16:48,900
I'd like to be picked up.

1525
01:16:48,984 --> 01:16:50,860
So, we're gonna see
you guys soon, right?

1526
01:16:50,944 --> 01:16:52,279
- Yes.
- Yeah.

1527
01:16:52,362 --> 01:16:54,155
- Okay.
- It's... Wow.

1528
01:16:54,281 --> 01:16:55,699
Pink flamingos.

1529
01:17:00,787 --> 01:17:01,955
<i>I put my hand in</i>

1530
01:17:02,038 --> 01:17:03,039
Right?

1531
01:17:04,499 --> 01:17:06,668
<i>Into the bush</i>

1532
01:17:09,963 --> 01:17:11,798
<i>Finding the sweetest</i>

1533
01:17:11,923 --> 01:17:14,092
<i>Sweetest rose</i>

1534
01:17:18,221 --> 01:17:20,640
<i>I pricked my finger</i>

1535
01:17:20,974 --> 01:17:24,978
<i>Deep to the line</i>

1536
01:17:25,103 --> 01:17:29,107
<i>And left the sweetest rose</i>

1537
01:17:29,482 --> 01:17:32,777
<i>Sweetest rose behind</i>

1538
01:17:34,321 --> 01:17:36,865
<i>Don't you...</i>

1539
01:17:40,952 --> 01:17:44,289
We're here in beautiful
Ocean City, New Jersey,

1540
01:17:44,581 --> 01:17:45,832
with the folks.

1541
01:17:46,166 --> 01:17:49,377
This is my mother Marilyn,
with her 40 library books.

1542
01:17:49,711 --> 01:17:51,171
- And my knitting.
- And her knitting.

1543
01:17:51,254 --> 01:17:52,964
Marilyn, wave to the camera.

1544
01:17:54,758 --> 01:17:56,468
- And we have my dad.
- Hi, Bob.

1545
01:17:56,593 --> 01:18:00,847
Bob, grand master of mah-jongg.

1546
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:03,350
Did you wave, Bob?

1547
01:18:04,267 --> 01:18:05,894
- Big wave.
- Mmm-hmm.

1548
01:18:08,271 --> 01:18:09,689
That's it. Here we are.

1549
01:18:14,778 --> 01:18:17,739
Oh, yes, bubbles.
That's what the people want.

1550
01:18:17,864 --> 01:18:19,950
It's what the people
are gonna get.

1551
01:18:20,659 --> 01:18:21,952
Hopefully.

1552
01:18:27,165 --> 01:18:30,001
- Huh. Could be better.
- Not bad.

1553
01:18:33,713 --> 01:18:35,382
Well, bubbles are finicky.

1554
01:18:35,882 --> 01:18:38,843
<i>She sailed as deep as
deep as she could be</i>

1555
01:18:38,927 --> 01:18:40,887
- Okay, bye.
- Okay, bye.

1556
01:18:42,514 --> 01:18:46,393
<i>Don't you</i>

1557
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:53,984
<i>Break my heart</i>

1558
01:18:54,901 --> 01:18:56,194
I will delete it, Michael.

1559
01:18:56,278 --> 01:18:57,445
Okay, bye.

1560
01:19:00,949 --> 01:19:03,577
<i>Thousands and thousands</i>

1561
01:19:03,702 --> 01:19:06,246
<i>All on this Earth</i>

1562
01:19:18,633 --> 01:19:21,052
Thank you for booking this.

1563
01:19:28,685 --> 01:19:29,811
I love you.

1564
01:19:30,729 --> 01:19:32,063
I love you, too.

1565
01:21:00,485 --> 01:21:01,611
Hello.

1566
01:21:01,736 --> 01:21:04,489
Hello. What a morning, huh?

1567
01:21:04,573 --> 01:21:05,615
Right?

1568
01:21:09,202 --> 01:21:11,288
How did you ever find this place?

1569
01:21:12,664 --> 01:21:14,207
I've been here before.

1570
01:21:14,291 --> 01:21:18,295
My family, we used to
take vacations here when I was a kid.

1571
01:21:21,006 --> 01:21:22,841
Thank you for inviting us.

1572
01:21:22,924 --> 01:21:24,593
No, no. It was Kit's idea.

1573
01:21:24,759 --> 01:21:26,136
He wanted you here.

1574
01:21:29,347 --> 01:21:31,516
I was vehemently opposed to it.

1575
01:21:32,225 --> 01:21:33,852
You brat.

1576
01:21:55,081 --> 01:21:56,541
I have a headache.

1577
01:21:57,542 --> 01:21:59,753
We found a number of nodules on the brain.

1578
01:22:00,462 --> 01:22:02,505
Several of them located
near the brain stem,

1579
01:22:02,589 --> 01:22:04,674
which is likely what's been
causing your headaches.

1580
01:22:06,676 --> 01:22:07,677
How big are they?

1581
01:22:10,513 --> 01:22:13,558
Well, they're small,
but there are a lot of them.

1582
01:22:16,311 --> 01:22:18,313
And your primary tumor
has been growing again.

1583
01:22:19,231 --> 01:22:21,524
- How long?
- We don't like to predict these things.

1584
01:22:21,608 --> 01:22:23,151
Six weeks? Six months?

1585
01:22:24,986 --> 01:22:26,613
More than six weeks.

1586
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:29,866
I've been feeling so much better.

1587
01:22:31,534 --> 01:22:34,204
The radiation bought you some time.

1588
01:22:35,497 --> 01:22:38,667
At this point, all we can do
is address your symptoms

1589
01:22:38,792 --> 01:22:40,502
and manage your pain.

1590
01:22:47,509 --> 01:22:48,969
I'm so sorry, Kit.

1591
01:23:08,738 --> 01:23:10,532
<i>There are still options here.</i>

1592
01:23:10,615 --> 01:23:12,867
There's this targeted treatment.

1593
01:23:12,951 --> 01:23:14,202
It's for NETs.

1594
01:23:14,286 --> 01:23:17,622
It's being developed in Germany,
and I can't remember what it's called.

1595
01:23:17,706 --> 01:23:20,584
- Michael.
- "Affinator" or "Afinator" or something.

1596
01:23:20,667 --> 01:23:22,836
- Michael.
- But I just... It blocks...

1597
01:23:22,919 --> 01:23:26,548
I think a protein signaling
pathway that's in the...

1598
01:23:26,631 --> 01:23:28,425
- It can malfunction...
- Really? Germany?

1599
01:23:28,508 --> 01:23:29,926
And leads to greater tumor growth
or something.

1600
01:23:30,010 --> 01:23:34,014
I'm telling you that there are still
experimental things going on out there.

1601
01:23:34,097 --> 01:23:35,724
There was somebody
I read about who's from Italy.

1602
01:23:35,807 --> 01:23:37,642
- Michael, stop. Stop.
- He had a doctor...

1603
01:23:40,228 --> 01:23:41,479
It's everywhere.

1604
01:23:42,522 --> 01:23:43,773
It's in my brain.

1605
01:23:43,857 --> 01:23:45,775
And actually, I'm relieved.

1606
01:23:48,904 --> 01:23:50,447
I know where I stand now.

1607
01:23:56,369 --> 01:23:57,454
Come on.

1608
01:24:49,881 --> 01:24:51,007
Are you...

1609
01:24:57,764 --> 01:24:59,474
Are you afraid to die?

1610
01:25:02,060 --> 01:25:04,396
I'm afraid
of what the end looks like, but...

1611
01:25:08,233 --> 01:25:09,776
Am I afraid of dying?

1612
01:25:14,281 --> 01:25:15,365
No.

1613
01:25:17,617 --> 01:25:19,244
I've had a great life, Mike.

1614
01:25:33,633 --> 01:25:35,635
And I want you to be happy, too.

1615
01:25:37,345 --> 01:25:38,805
That includes meeting someone.

1616
01:25:38,888 --> 01:25:41,016
No. Please don't do...

1617
01:25:43,727 --> 01:25:46,730
I really appreciate that,
but I can't talk about that right now.

1618
01:25:49,024 --> 01:25:50,025
Okay.

1619
01:26:18,303 --> 01:26:20,472
Did you have sex with Sebastian?

1620
01:26:28,521 --> 01:26:29,564
Yes.

1621
01:26:36,404 --> 01:26:37,948
I'm sorry I lied to you.

1622
01:26:40,617 --> 01:26:41,910
I'm sorry, too.

1623
01:26:43,495 --> 01:26:47,332
I'm sorry that I made you carry
so much of my baggage for so many years

1624
01:26:47,415 --> 01:26:49,834
and making you feel like
the bad guy so many times

1625
01:26:49,918 --> 01:26:51,378
when you didn't deserve to.

1626
01:26:52,462 --> 01:26:54,464
I'm sorry I never told you

1627
01:26:55,090 --> 01:26:57,175
how good your ass looks
in your khaki pants.

1628
01:26:57,259 --> 01:26:58,635
'Cause it does.

1629
01:26:59,177 --> 01:27:00,845
And I couldn't do it
'cause I was afraid

1630
01:27:00,929 --> 01:27:02,722
if you understood
how beautiful you are

1631
01:27:02,806 --> 01:27:04,182
that you'd leave me.

1632
01:27:08,562 --> 01:27:10,647
And I'm sorry you're going through this.

1633
01:27:13,316 --> 01:27:14,568
Thank you.

1634
01:27:18,196 --> 01:27:20,198
I would like to try some of this pot.

1635
01:27:20,282 --> 01:27:22,117
Oh, my God.

1636
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:26,871
Don't laugh. I'm not kidding.

1637
01:27:30,917 --> 01:27:33,044
If I don't try pot with you...

1638
01:27:34,504 --> 01:27:35,505
Okay.

1639
01:27:35,797 --> 01:27:37,090
I can't believe it.

1640
01:27:37,841 --> 01:27:39,718
- Okay, take this. I can...
- That's the pot?

1641
01:27:39,843 --> 01:27:41,177
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1642
01:27:47,767 --> 01:27:49,311
- No. Other end. You...
- Oh.

1643
01:27:51,062 --> 01:27:52,439
- Gonna eat it.
- Jesus.

1644
01:27:52,689 --> 01:27:53,815
That's right.

1645
01:27:54,524 --> 01:27:55,525
Now...

1646
01:27:57,569 --> 01:27:58,570
Have a hit.

1647
01:28:02,949 --> 01:28:04,034
Oh, wow.

1648
01:28:04,117 --> 01:28:05,702
Oh, God.

1649
01:28:06,036 --> 01:28:08,079
It hurts.

1650
01:28:08,163 --> 01:28:09,539
Have some...
Take a sip. Take a sip.

1651
01:28:09,664 --> 01:28:10,790
Okay.

1652
01:28:15,128 --> 01:28:16,546
I don't feel it.
It's not working.

1653
01:28:16,630 --> 01:28:18,673
Well, try again.
Have a... Have another hit.

1654
01:28:18,924 --> 01:28:20,091
- Okay.
- You can do it.

1655
01:28:30,101 --> 01:28:31,394
Hold, hold, hold.

1656
01:28:34,648 --> 01:28:35,941
Exhale.

1657
01:28:42,239 --> 01:28:43,990
Exhale my smoke.

1658
01:28:47,244 --> 01:28:48,245
So?

1659
01:28:53,792 --> 01:28:55,126
I don't know.

1660
01:29:01,716 --> 01:29:03,218
- Mmm...
- Oh?

1661
01:29:03,301 --> 01:29:05,011
- Maybe I feel...
- Oh...

1662
01:29:06,638 --> 01:29:07,806
I don't know.

1663
01:29:07,973 --> 01:29:11,101
Welcome to the Stoners Club,
Michael Ausiello.

1664
01:29:11,351 --> 01:29:13,353
We've been waiting for you
for a long time.

1665
01:29:14,145 --> 01:29:15,438
And now you know how...

1666
01:29:16,314 --> 01:29:17,857
Cherry Garcia feels.

1667
01:29:35,458 --> 01:29:36,918
Let's get married, Mike.

1668
01:29:37,752 --> 01:29:40,046
- Are you joking?
- No, I want to.

1669
01:29:41,631 --> 01:29:43,258
We've been through so much.

1670
01:29:44,926 --> 01:29:46,636
We're about to go through more.

1671
01:29:49,180 --> 01:29:50,682
I want to be your husband.

1672
01:29:52,809 --> 01:29:53,977
You're calling me chattel.

1673
01:29:56,104 --> 01:29:58,189
- That's what you said.
- Michael.

1674
01:29:58,940 --> 01:30:00,901
- Chattel.
- Will you marry me?

1675
01:30:03,028 --> 01:30:04,446
Oh, my God.

1676
01:30:04,779 --> 01:30:07,073
No rush, Mike, but I feel obliged
to tell you that I'm dying here.

1677
01:30:09,159 --> 01:30:10,619
Yes. Yes.

1678
01:30:12,871 --> 01:30:14,205
They here? You see them?

1679
01:30:14,331 --> 01:30:15,832
- Hi!
- Hi.

1680
01:30:15,916 --> 01:30:17,125
Look at these grooms. Gorgeous.

1681
01:30:17,250 --> 01:30:18,335
- Oh, my goodness.
- Oh, my God.

1682
01:30:18,418 --> 01:30:20,211
- You look great.
- Oh, my God!

1683
01:30:20,503 --> 01:30:22,505
Hey, get out of my shot!
What are you doing?

1684
01:30:24,674 --> 01:30:26,760
Cut! All right,
everybody cut! Cut!

1685
01:30:26,843 --> 01:30:28,261
Look at this. You look great.

1686
01:30:28,386 --> 01:30:30,305
- Okay.
- You okay?

1687
01:30:30,388 --> 01:30:31,431
Yeah. Yes.

1688
01:30:31,514 --> 01:30:32,641
- You excited?
- Yes.

1689
01:30:33,183 --> 01:30:34,684
All electronic devices
in the bin.

1690
01:30:34,768 --> 01:30:37,395
<i>What's that writing on your shelf...</i>

1691
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:38,772
Mike, come see this.

1692
01:30:38,897 --> 01:30:40,482
Look how pretty this is.

1693
01:30:40,774 --> 01:30:42,150
- We're walking fast.
- Yes.

1694
01:30:42,234 --> 01:30:45,320
<i>In the bathrooms
and the bad motels...</i>

1695
01:30:45,403 --> 01:30:47,405
- Hello. Hi.
- Hi.

1696
01:30:47,489 --> 01:30:49,074
- How can I help you?
- So, that is our marriage certificate.

1697
01:30:49,157 --> 01:30:50,992
- Oh, marriage certificate.
- And his birth certificate.

1698
01:30:51,076 --> 01:30:54,746
Sign... I've got a pen.
I brought one with me. Yes.

1699
01:30:55,580 --> 01:30:57,040
- Thank you.
- Sign right here.

1700
01:30:58,083 --> 01:30:59,709
Congratulations on your marriage.

1701
01:31:01,878 --> 01:31:07,133
<i>It pulls all on down my sore feet...</i>

1702
01:31:10,595 --> 01:31:12,722
Do you, Christopher "Cowhan,"

1703
01:31:12,806 --> 01:31:15,892
solemnly declare Michael "Auswello"

1704
01:31:16,309 --> 01:31:17,769
to be your husband?

1705
01:31:20,021 --> 01:31:21,231
I do.

1706
01:31:22,023 --> 01:31:23,275
Do you promise to love, honor

1707
01:31:23,358 --> 01:31:25,318
and keep him for as long
as you both shall live?

1708
01:31:25,819 --> 01:31:26,820
I do.

1709
01:31:27,195 --> 01:31:30,865
Do you, Michael Auswe...
"Auswello"...

1710
01:31:30,949 --> 01:31:32,742
- Ausiello.
- Solemnly declare

1711
01:31:32,826 --> 01:31:35,370
Christopher "Cowhan"
to be your husband?

1712
01:31:35,829 --> 01:31:36,913
I do.

1713
01:31:37,372 --> 01:31:38,665
Do you promise to love, honor

1714
01:31:38,748 --> 01:31:40,917
and keep him for as long
as you both shall live?

1715
01:31:42,335 --> 01:31:43,461
I do.

1716
01:31:44,629 --> 01:31:47,048
By the power vested in me
by the great state of New York,

1717
01:31:47,132 --> 01:31:48,216
I now pronounce you married.

1718
01:31:48,550 --> 01:31:49,968
You may seal your vows with a kiss.

1719
01:31:52,846 --> 01:31:56,266
<i>Oh, gotta see</i>

1720
01:31:56,349 --> 01:31:58,602
<i>Gotta know right now...</i>

1721
01:32:05,775 --> 01:32:09,446
<i>It isn't anything at all...</i>

1722
01:32:09,571 --> 01:32:12,407
We have news,
and, and this time, it's good.

1723
01:32:12,490 --> 01:32:14,618
<i>- Okay.
- -Uh, Mike and I got married.</i>

1724
01:32:14,701 --> 01:32:15,702
<i>What?</i>

1725
01:32:16,411 --> 01:32:19,414
<i>Oh, wow. Tell me everything.</i>

1726
01:32:19,998 --> 01:32:23,209
- Uh. Yeah. We decided last night.
- It was quick.

1727
01:32:23,501 --> 01:32:25,629
<i>Bob, the boys got married.</i>

1728
01:32:25,921 --> 01:32:28,715
<i>That's incredible.
Congratulations!</i>

1729
01:32:28,924 --> 01:32:30,759
<i>We got
one last Christmas together.</i>

1730
01:32:30,842 --> 01:32:31,843
- Hey.
- Hey.

1731
01:32:31,968 --> 01:32:33,637
- Here. Let me take the bags.
- Yes. Yes.

1732
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:35,388
- Where is he? Where is he?
- Hi, Mom. Dad.

1733
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:37,766
Hi, honey. Hi. Hi.

1734
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:40,310
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1735
01:32:40,435 --> 01:32:41,603
- How you doing?
- Hi.

1736
01:32:42,187 --> 01:32:43,688
- I'm good.
- Hey, Dad.

1737
01:32:45,398 --> 01:32:49,152
<i>Everything will fall right into place</i>

1738
01:32:49,277 --> 01:32:53,865
<i>When we die some sink and some lay</i>

1739
01:32:53,990 --> 01:32:58,203
<i>But at least I don't see you float away...</i>

1740
01:32:58,995 --> 01:33:00,163
Some tissue paper.

1741
01:33:00,247 --> 01:33:03,500
- It's for the tree.
- A bird.

1742
01:33:03,583 --> 01:33:05,502
- Oh.
- Oh, that is sweet.

1743
01:33:05,585 --> 01:33:07,420
It's a partridge in a pear tree.

1744
01:33:07,504 --> 01:33:09,881
- It's beautiful.
- I'm gonna hang this up right now.

1745
01:33:09,965 --> 01:33:11,424
Bob, sing the song.

1746
01:33:11,675 --> 01:33:13,260
- Come on. Here we go.
- Bob, don't you dare.

1747
01:33:13,385 --> 01:33:15,136
- Bob.
- Michael says...

1748
01:33:15,220 --> 01:33:16,972
- Bob, sing us a little...
- Michael doesn't know, Bob.

1749
01:33:17,055 --> 01:33:18,515
No, sing the song, Bob.

1750
01:33:18,848 --> 01:33:21,685
<i>And we watched
our favorite show, Drag Race.</i>

1751
01:33:22,227 --> 01:33:24,145
RuPaul's holiday spectacular.

1752
01:33:37,951 --> 01:33:41,621
<i>Somebody said you got a new friend</i>

1753
01:33:45,875 --> 01:33:49,713
<i>Does she love you better than I can?</i>

1754
01:33:53,925 --> 01:33:58,054
<i>It's a big black sky over my town</i>

1755
01:34:02,183 --> 01:34:06,271
<i>I know where you at
I bet she's around</i>

1756
01:34:10,859 --> 01:34:14,029
<i>Yeah, I know it's stupid</i>

1757
01:34:14,487 --> 01:34:18,366
<i>I just gotta see it for myself</i>

1758
01:34:19,159 --> 01:34:22,537
<i>I'm in the corner watching you kiss her</i>

1759
01:34:22,621 --> 01:34:23,663
Michael.

1760
01:34:23,747 --> 01:34:25,290
<i>Oh</i>

1761
01:34:27,042 --> 01:34:30,211
<i>I keep dancing on my own</i>

1762
01:35:12,837 --> 01:35:13,964
Hi.

1763
01:35:15,131 --> 01:35:16,299
Hey.

1764
01:35:19,177 --> 01:35:21,263
Kit. Hey.

1765
01:35:22,347 --> 01:35:24,474
- You have a visitor.
- Who?

1766
01:35:28,812 --> 01:35:29,813
Oh.

1767
01:35:29,896 --> 01:35:31,314
Sebastian.

1768
01:35:32,190 --> 01:35:33,275
Hi.

1769
01:35:33,358 --> 01:35:35,694
I'm gonna
go get a Diet Coke, if you want to come.

1770
01:35:35,777 --> 01:35:37,237
- Yeah, okay.
- You come and get some coffee?

1771
01:35:37,362 --> 01:35:38,655
Yeah, that's a good idea.

1772
01:36:09,811 --> 01:36:11,897
Could you hold that for me?
Thank you.

1773
01:36:15,233 --> 01:36:16,234
Hi.

1774
01:36:20,155 --> 01:36:21,948
Thank you for letting me see him.

1775
01:36:37,589 --> 01:36:39,090
How long does he have?

1776
01:36:40,008 --> 01:36:41,217
Couple of hours.

1777
01:36:41,301 --> 01:36:43,053
Maybe more, maybe less.

1778
01:36:44,804 --> 01:36:45,889
He can hear you.

1779
01:36:47,682 --> 01:36:48,808
Talk to him.

1780
01:36:49,142 --> 01:36:50,560
Tell him you love him.

1781
01:36:51,228 --> 01:36:53,104
Assure him you'll be okay without him.

1782
01:36:55,315 --> 01:36:56,691
I'm so sorry.

1783
01:37:11,790 --> 01:37:13,792
I love you, I love you,
I love you, I love you.

1784
01:37:15,585 --> 01:37:17,337
I will forever and ever.

1785
01:37:20,173 --> 01:37:22,884
Don't be scared, sweetie pie.
Don't be scared.

1786
01:37:24,552 --> 01:37:25,679
We're all here.

1787
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:39,776
Kitty.

1788
01:37:42,445 --> 01:37:44,239
You go whenever you need to, son.

1789
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:46,700
We'll be okay.

1790
01:37:47,659 --> 01:37:50,078
Yeah, we'll be okay.
We'll be okay.

1791
01:38:45,759 --> 01:38:47,552
And cut. That's cut, everybody.

1792
01:38:47,636 --> 01:38:48,678
Let's take five.

1793
01:38:48,762 --> 01:38:50,263
Okay. That felt good, right?

1794
01:38:50,347 --> 01:38:51,514
- Yeah.
- Nice.

1795
01:38:53,767 --> 01:38:55,101
Can I get my sides?

1796
01:38:57,771 --> 01:38:59,731
<i>What if this
didn't have to happen?</i>

1797
01:38:59,814 --> 01:39:01,066
- Sorry. Thanks.
- Yeah.

1798
01:39:01,191 --> 01:39:03,985
<i>What if this were just
a scene from our story?</i>

1799
01:39:04,069 --> 01:39:06,071
- Reset!
- Resetting.

1800
01:39:06,154 --> 01:39:08,823
<i>A scene from
the TV show of our life.</i>

1801
01:39:08,907 --> 01:39:10,116
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1802
01:39:10,617 --> 01:39:11,868
<i>How amazing would that be?</i>

1803
01:39:13,161 --> 01:39:14,663
<i>If none of this was real.</i>

1804
01:39:15,622 --> 01:39:18,124
<i>If I could just go back
to being a TV journalist</i>

1805
01:39:18,208 --> 01:39:20,835
<i>and you could be
an actor on a show.</i>

1806
01:39:20,919 --> 01:39:23,421
Excuse me, Kit. Excuse me.

1807
01:39:23,505 --> 01:39:25,548
Hey. Can I help you?

1808
01:39:25,632 --> 01:39:27,926
<i>Yes, I'm Michael Ausiello with TVLine.</i>

1809
01:39:28,009 --> 01:39:29,803
I know you're super busy,
but I was wondering

1810
01:39:29,886 --> 01:39:31,888
if you wouldn't
mind answering a few quick questions.

1811
01:39:31,972 --> 01:39:34,182
- Uh, yeah. Yeah, sure. Go ahead.
- Great.

1812
01:39:34,266 --> 01:39:35,767
Hey, Kit, we need last looks.

1813
01:39:36,017 --> 01:39:37,310
Oh, um...

1814
01:39:37,769 --> 01:39:39,437
I'd love to stay and talk,
but it looks like I've... I got to...

1815
01:39:39,521 --> 01:39:42,190
Oh, gosh. If you don't mind,
I'd really like to get

1816
01:39:42,274 --> 01:39:44,651
your feelings,
your thoughts on a couple of things.

1817
01:39:44,734 --> 01:39:46,027
Hey, Kit. They're calling for you.

1818
01:39:46,111 --> 01:39:49,531
Please, this won't take long. I promise.
I just really need a moment with him.

1819
01:39:49,656 --> 01:39:50,907
- Okay? Okay?
- It's okay. It's fine.

1820
01:39:50,991 --> 01:39:52,325
- Okay.
- It's fine.

1821
01:39:52,409 --> 01:39:54,077
- Go ahead.
- First question,

1822
01:39:54,327 --> 01:39:57,581
your character on the show
has been very popular,

1823
01:39:58,123 --> 01:40:02,877
and everyone hates
to see you go, so what is next for you?

1824
01:40:03,044 --> 01:40:04,921
I... I don't know. Um...

1825
01:40:05,005 --> 01:40:07,257
There are a lot of
possibilities out there, so...

1826
01:40:07,757 --> 01:40:09,092
I don't know what's next for me, honestly.

1827
01:40:09,342 --> 01:40:11,261
Um... You know, it's strange.

1828
01:40:11,428 --> 01:40:12,554
Uh...

1829
01:40:13,513 --> 01:40:15,890
Everyone will still be here,

1830
01:40:17,350 --> 01:40:20,186
and I'll be... gone.

1831
01:40:21,229 --> 01:40:23,189
And how do you feel right now?

1832
01:40:23,273 --> 01:40:25,400
Ooh. Uh, great question.

1833
01:40:27,903 --> 01:40:31,072
I guess I feel like I'll...

1834
01:40:32,782 --> 01:40:33,783
miss this.

1835
01:40:36,870 --> 01:40:38,079
I'll miss this a lot.

1836
01:40:38,163 --> 01:40:40,206
Camera's ready.
Kit, we really got to go.

1837
01:40:40,332 --> 01:40:42,459
No. Please, one more second.
Just one more.

1838
01:40:42,542 --> 01:40:44,169
- Just one question.
- Shoot. Go ahead.

1839
01:40:46,046 --> 01:40:47,297
What about me, Kit?

1840
01:40:48,965 --> 01:40:50,050
What should I do next?

1841
01:40:51,217 --> 01:40:52,260
You'll know.

1842
01:40:52,928 --> 01:40:54,179
Okay, we're back in.

1843
01:40:54,679 --> 01:40:56,640
Okay. Got it. I'm coming.

1844
01:40:59,100 --> 01:41:01,603
So, have you got
everything you need?

1845
01:41:04,940 --> 01:41:06,024
You're gonna be okay.

1846
01:41:08,652 --> 01:41:09,653
Yeah.

1847
01:41:10,779 --> 01:41:11,947
I'm gonna be okay.

1848
01:41:13,823 --> 01:41:16,117
It's gonna be incredibly hard,

1849
01:41:17,869 --> 01:41:19,287
but I'm gonna be okay.

1850
01:41:24,584 --> 01:41:27,337
Thank you for the past 13 years.

1851
01:41:28,004 --> 01:41:30,048
Thank you for giving me a family.

1852
01:41:31,549 --> 01:41:33,051
Thank you for loving me.

1853
01:41:35,053 --> 01:41:36,054
<i>Kit.</i>

1854
01:41:44,104 --> 01:41:45,522
You can go now.

1855
01:42:10,547 --> 01:42:13,383
<i>I was always afraid
Kit would break my heart.</i>

1856
01:42:14,092 --> 01:42:15,760
<i>And eventually, he did.</i>

1857
01:42:16,261 --> 01:42:18,138
<i>But not in the way I feared he would.</i>

1858
01:42:19,055 --> 01:42:21,600
<i>He broke it open in a way that</i>

1859
01:42:21,975 --> 01:42:24,561
somehow made room for even more love,

1860
01:42:24,895 --> 01:42:27,147
both to receive and to give.

1861
01:42:28,231 --> 01:42:31,610
And so, I hope that you'll understand me

1862
01:42:31,693 --> 01:42:36,406
when I say that this ride
with Kit was, to me, a gift.

1863
01:42:37,949 --> 01:42:40,827
It was the greatest honor
I believe I will ever have

1864
01:42:41,703 --> 01:42:45,123
to have been
by his side for it all.

1865
01:42:52,672 --> 01:42:55,759
Okay. Hey, Marilyn.

1866
01:42:56,343 --> 01:42:58,720
I need to breathe.
I need to breathe.

1867
01:43:03,558 --> 01:43:04,893
It's a car.

1868
01:43:08,980 --> 01:43:10,607
Oh, God.

1869
01:43:18,073 --> 01:43:20,242
I think he would've liked your eulogy.

1870
01:43:24,955 --> 01:43:26,957
I think he would've thought
it was too long.

1871
01:43:27,457 --> 01:43:28,583
Well, probably.

1872
01:43:34,089 --> 01:43:35,882
What are you gonna do next?

1873
01:43:36,007 --> 01:43:37,425
I mean, besides...

1874
01:43:38,426 --> 01:43:39,678
triathlons.

1875
01:43:41,054 --> 01:43:42,889
I've never been to Spain,
and I always...

1876
01:43:43,765 --> 01:43:47,477
I always wanted to see
that funny-looking museum.

1877
01:43:48,478 --> 01:43:50,188
- The Guggenheim in Bilbao?
- Yes. Yes.

1878
01:43:50,272 --> 01:43:51,648
Yes, that's funny.

1879
01:43:51,773 --> 01:43:53,775
In the pictures, it looks like a big ship.

1880
01:43:53,942 --> 01:43:54,943
It does look like a ship.

1881
01:43:55,026 --> 01:43:56,486
- Do you think?
- Yeah, it does.

1882
01:43:58,822 --> 01:44:02,284
I don't know,
I'd just like to get away for a while.

1883
01:44:02,867 --> 01:44:04,411
That sounds really nice.

1884
01:44:05,620 --> 01:44:07,330
New scenery to run in.

1885
01:44:07,956 --> 01:44:08,957
Oh.

1886
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:13,545
Yeah, all the running
stays the same if my knees hold on.

1887
01:44:15,547 --> 01:44:18,091
- Race you to the house.
- Okay.

1888
01:44:46,036 --> 01:44:48,204
<i>The hardest thing
about a story ending</i>

1889
01:44:48,288 --> 01:44:52,000
<i>is that you have to say goodbye
to your favorite characters.</i>

1890
01:44:53,168 --> 01:44:54,920
<i>To your favorite people.</i>

1891
01:44:56,630 --> 01:45:00,717
<i>A good TV show can make real life
seem like it makes sense.</i>

1892
01:45:01,217 --> 01:45:04,679
<i>And a good ending
can feel like the end of one thing</i>

1893
01:45:04,763 --> 01:45:06,514
<i>and the beginning of another.</i>

1894
01:45:07,641 --> 01:45:09,601
<i>Sometimes the hero dies.</i>

1895
01:45:10,810 --> 01:45:14,856
<i>Sometimes we only get 14 Christmas trees
when we thought we'd have 40.</i>

1896
01:45:18,318 --> 01:45:20,278
<i>And then an old friend reminded me</i>

1897
01:45:20,362 --> 01:45:23,782
<i>that sometimes the main character
has to take a leap of faith</i>

1898
01:45:24,074 --> 01:45:26,159
<i>that involves packing a suitcase</i>

1899
01:45:26,534 --> 01:45:28,245
<i>and traveling across the country.</i>

1900
01:45:30,455 --> 01:45:31,456
<i>I don't know.</i>

1901
01:45:31,998 --> 01:45:33,625
<i>Maybe that's too on the nose.</i>

1902
01:45:57,190 --> 01:45:59,067
- Hi.
- Where we going?

1903
01:45:59,359 --> 01:46:00,360
Uh, JFK.

1904
01:46:04,573 --> 01:46:05,657
Where you off to?

1905
01:46:06,741 --> 01:46:07,909
Los Angeles.

1906
01:46:08,535 --> 01:46:09,536
Oof.

1907
01:46:10,078 --> 01:46:11,621
That 405, man.

1908
01:46:12,247 --> 01:46:14,249
That thing takes no prisoners, huh?

1909
01:46:14,916 --> 01:46:17,460
<i>I wanted our story
to be a picture-perfect,</i>

1910
01:46:17,544 --> 01:46:19,129
<i>happy-ending love story.</i>

1911
01:46:22,716 --> 01:46:25,302
<i>But what we got was a real love story.</i>

1912
01:46:27,596 --> 01:46:28,680
I'm ready.

1913
01:46:33,101 --> 01:46:34,477
<i>I'll just shut up now.</i>

1914
01:46:39,399 --> 01:46:42,777
<i>Don't you</i>

1915
01:46:47,157 --> 01:46:52,787
<i>Break my heart</i>

1916
01:46:56,791 --> 01:47:02,714
<i>Don't you</i>

1917
01:47:04,716 --> 01:47:11,056
<i>Break my heart</i>

1918
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:17,646
<i>I put my hand in</i>

1919
01:47:19,147 --> 01:47:21,900
<i>Into the bush</i>

1920
01:47:24,277 --> 01:47:26,488
<i>Finding the sweetest</i>

1921
01:47:26,613 --> 01:47:30,575
<i>Sweetest rose</i>

1922
01:47:32,911 --> 01:47:34,829
<i>Saw a ship sailing</i>

1923
01:47:35,288 --> 01:47:38,250
<i>On the big blue sea</i>

1924
01:47:41,461 --> 01:47:43,755
<i>She sailed as deep as</i>

1925
01:47:43,880 --> 01:47:47,634
<i>Deep as she could be</i>

1926
01:47:50,095 --> 01:47:52,264
<i>But not so deep in</i>

1927
01:47:52,389 --> 01:47:56,476
<i>In love as I am</i>

1928
01:47:56,601 --> 01:48:00,897
<i>I cannot whether I</i>

1929
01:48:00,981 --> 01:48:04,776
<i>I sink or swim</i>

1930
01:48:04,859 --> 01:48:10,407
<i>Don't you</i>

1931
01:48:12,909 --> 01:48:17,872
<i>Break my heart</i>

1932
01:48:17,956 --> 01:48:19,583
Oh, that's why
I wanted my camera.

1933
01:48:19,666 --> 01:48:20,959
What?

1934
01:48:21,084 --> 01:48:22,752
I thought it looked
like the sun.

1935
01:48:22,877 --> 01:48:25,005
<i>Don't you...</i>

1936
01:48:25,130 --> 01:48:27,132
These bubbles are very finicky.

1937
01:48:31,136 --> 01:48:32,804
- Bye.
- Bye.

1938
01:48:32,929 --> 01:48:34,014
Bye, now.

1939
01:48:39,227 --> 01:48:45,817
<i>Don't you</i>

1940
01:48:47,110 --> 01:48:50,614
<i>Break my heart</i>

1941
01:48:56,703 --> 01:49:01,833
<i>Don't you</i>

1942
01:49:04,753 --> 01:49:10,926
<i>Break my heart</i>

1943
01:49:15,388 --> 01:49:17,849
<i>Thousands and thousands</i>

1944
01:49:17,974 --> 01:49:21,102
<i>All on this Earth</i>
