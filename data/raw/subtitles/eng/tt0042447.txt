1
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,870
THE KING OF THE WEST

2
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,280
Don't eat popcorn during my performance

3
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,260
villagers.

4
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:32,180
January 6, 1912.

5
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:35,450
William Howard Taft,
President of these United States,

6
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,650
signs an agreement admitting
the territory of New Mexico

7
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,560
in the Union as State No. 47.

8
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,890
From a distant day in 1850,

9
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,560
the stubborn colonizers
of this vast territory

10
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:48,560
they demanded their rights as a state.

11
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,360
This is not the story of how New Mexico won

12
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,770
his heartbreaking fight for admission.

13
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:58,570
But the story of one of the reasons
for a 62-year struggle.

14
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,180
This is the saga of a lost cause

15
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:04,040
and a man who helped lose her.

16
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,520
His story begins one summer day in 1905

17
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:11,060
on a cricket ground
on the outskirts of London.

18
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:17,560
The result is 76 for the
"gentlemen", 105 for the "players".

19
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:22,060
Lynhaven is ready to
pitch Mr. Fairwick again.

20
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,400
A splendid blow.

21
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,540
There, I say.

22
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,470
- Aggie! stop whistling.
- But Ma, he hit a pigeon.

23
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,670
Whistling is not refined.
And now leave it...

24
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,210
Or I'll hit you over the head with this

25
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,940
I say she's a bit fat, right?

26
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,150
For my part I find the
young woman quite intriguing.

27
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,620
You won't be serious, Van-Basingwell.

28
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,690
I've never seen anything so vulgar.

29
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,460
Dress, flashy jewelry,
disgusting display of wealth.

30
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,890
Yes, of course.

31
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:55,730
And I take the opportunity
to introduce myself.

32
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,800
- Do not tell me.
- Yes.

33
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,440
My name is Floud.

34
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,570
The mother is American, new rich,

35
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:05,580
willing to instill culture
in her daughter Agatha.

36
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:09,540
- Pretty sweet, huh, Twombley?
- Almost like tea, George.

37
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,650
More than a cup of tea, Twombley.

38
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:15,350
I think I need something more
substantial these days.

39
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,990
Meat with potatoes.

40
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,160
I will not tell you.

41
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,920
No comment.

42
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,560
It is clear.

43
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,900
Look Ma, we already have a memory.

44
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,870
Get that ball back right now.

45
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,500
Deliver it.

46
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,280
¡Caray!

47
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,250
- You are injured?
- I think not.

48
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,220
- Can you continue?
- Of course.

49
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,020
- Tough guy.
- Let's keep going.

50
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,490
- Stay away from the game, will you?
- The Floud.

51
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,430
Excellence.
Glad to see you.

52
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,590
- Hello, Count.
- Hello. Ms. Floud, Ms. Floud,

53
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:06,760
I present to you my friend Lord Twombley.

54
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,370
- How?
- Twombley.

55
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,510
- How are you, Excellency?
- Charmed.

56
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,700
- Aggie.
- Haunted.

57
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,810
- I'm wondering the same.
- Well, count, what do you tell me?

58
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,920
What do I tell you?

59
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,480
Well not much.

60
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:23,820
I wonder if they would spend this
weekend at my mansion.

61
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,150
- It will be a pleasure.
- Good good.

62
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,190
I will present my family.

63
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,850
"It will be a delight, right, Aggie?"
- Yes, delighted.

64
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,730
Okay, then I'll send my car to pick you up.

65
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,270
We will be waiting, Excellency.

66
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,040
- Buenas tardes.
- See you later.

67
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,530
Goodbye.

68
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,420
- Now let's go somewhere else.
- Yes.

69
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,190
I'd like to take off these clothes.

70
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:56,020
But George,
you don't have a mansion or a family.

71
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,590
- But Reggie does.
- Reggie?

72
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,320
Yes, Reggie, and he's in Africa.

73
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,290
And I know how to dig up a suitable family.

74
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,790
HAMPTON NEWS PLAYERS Presenta

75
00:05:06,825 --> 00:05:08,790
THE PEARLS OF ALICE

76
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,870
Does anyone play tennis?

77
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:16,170
How do you think about tennis
in such weather?

78
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,040
But what do we do in this beastly game?

79
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:22,580
We need a suitable family
to impress American women.

80
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,920
Look at the mother.

81
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:30,080
Call Humphrey, Cyril.
My nerves cry out for tea.

82
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,980
Of course.

83
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,460
Did you call me, ma'am?

84
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,960
Why didn't you wait for
the doorbell to ring?, idiot.

85
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,710
Tea, madam?

86
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,950
I have slipped.

87
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:16,030
You got me drenched again,
monster! Let.

88
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:18,330
I'll dry this piece.

89
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,910
It is brown bread.
I just have to dry it.

90
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,810
- Dumber, American idiot.
- You should go back to your homeland.

91
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,910
If I could clarify the disappearance
of Alicia's necklace.

92
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,610
I'm not satisfied with
Humphrey's explanation in...

93
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,250
the moment of the crime.

94
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,410
I've already explained it to you, sir.

95
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,510
I was in town running
an errand for His Excellency, and...

96
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,690
And if His Excellency were here,
instead of hunting,

97
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:48,890
- could verify my statement.
- Already.

98
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:00,580
- Excellence!
- You heard him. What does it say?

99
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,410
Amazed by his fabulation.

100
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,020
I have never trusted a servant
who was such a scoundrel.

101
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:10,090
- He's lying, believe me. Lie
- It's no use, Humphrey.

102
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,520
I swear.

103
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:15,630
I was at Barkley Ltd, buying
elastics for His Excellency.

104
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,760
I can prove it because the man put
me on an elevator.

105
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:23,300
Humphrey, I accuse you of stealing
my lady's necklace.

106
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,900
It must be a mistake.

107
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,730
Humphrey is an old servant of the family...

108
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,770
It has been in the family for generations.

109
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:34,040
This man is not Humphrey, he
is an impostor.

110
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:38,120
When he said "elastic" for "braces"
and "elevator" for "elevator",

111
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,950
I suspected he was American.

112
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,650
¡Bravo, Cyril!

113
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,550
Accusations, just accusations.

114
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:48,590
I challenge you to provide a minimal proof.

115
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,630
Ask for proof, Sir Wimbley.

116
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,730
I can prove without question
that you are a criminal.

117
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,340
Do you expect a jury to believe that?

118
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,030
Then they will believe this.

119
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:03,570
They just gave me proof
of his fingerprints.

120
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,800
- Are they from the... lab?
- Unquestionably.

121
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:10,940
And they resemble those of the well-known
assassin Oliver Grimes.

122
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,950
All right, I'm Oliver Grimes,
the famous American assassin.

123
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,220
But they will never... take me alive.

124
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:25,530
Give it up, Mr. Grimes. I'm
Inspector Kirk from Scotland Yard.

125
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,390
Damn.

126
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,580
Unfortunately,
I have something of a recluse.

127
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,580
And now I face the embarrassing
problem of impressing Ms.

128
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,580
It is very difficult to explain.

129
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,740
As His Excellency says, he
has found an American girl

130
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,440
and wants to impress her.

131
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,250
He has a mansion in the country,
but pedants will not go.

132
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:55,290
You have to be
upper class ladies on the weekend.

133
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:58,730
- With a beautiful pay, eh?
- Yes of course.

134
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,490
- And in time for everyone.
- Yes.

135
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:03,000
It will be a pleasure to
help Your Excellency.

136
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:06,000
I think I can speak for everyone.

137
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,110
Yes, it will be a lot of fun.
Go.

138
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:11,240
- Except Humphrey, of course.
- Yes, we don't want him to...

139
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,400
Wow, why "except Humphrey, of course"?

140
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:17,410
- Your Excellency, dramatic colleague...
- No speeches, please.

141
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,980
Excellency, some members of the cast

142
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:22,090
They are jealous of my good performances.

143
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,550
I've played servant and gentleman
from Chicago to Liverpool,

144
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:28,990
and a slight blow to me is to all
the great names in the theater.

145
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,560
What did you say?

146
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:38,070
"Plenty of food and drink,
good pay and she spoils everything."

147
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,140
- Yes, precisely.
- Your Honor,

148
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:43,000
I beg you to grant me this opportunity.

149
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:46,700
I promise the best performance of
my career, if you grant it to me,

150
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,440
Or the waters of the Thames
will be my grave if you don't.

151
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,020
- Granted?
- Yeah come on.

152
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,180
- I won't overshadow you.
- Give him his chance.

153
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:59,120
Very good, but away from me.

154
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:01,490
- At your service, my lord.
- Good. At last.

155
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,460
I'll send you some cars.
You will surely enjoy.

156
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,290
Thanks a lot.

157
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,890
What dedication.
So elegant.

158
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,950
Surprise I'm a butler

159
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:40,030
Who really is a butler
Indifferent from my walk to my importance

160
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,290
I look as boring as the master, the lord

161
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:46,870
How I serve tea drinkers

162
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,570
He found out about Humphrey I'm that guy

163
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:54,040
Lover of quiet people

164
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,910
I'm here

165
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:59,440
Yes, my lord I am your knight and servant

166
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,680
What do I see, a damn pants Here, now

167
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,890
Yes my lord

168
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,650
Can I crumble the muffins in your tea?

169
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,850
Have a banana.

170
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:30,470
- Hello.
- Good afternoon, Mrs.

171
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,550
Aggie.

172
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,590
Buenas tardes.

173
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:49,130
- Your shawl, ma'am?
- Yes. Bought in Chicago.

174
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,830
I am the butler.
May l?

175
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:56,570
- Thanks. Your umbrella?
- I'll keep it. It could rain.

176
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,180
His Excellency waits in the garden.
Follow me, Mrs.

177
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,370
What kind.

178
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,540
I wish I had something like that at home.

179
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,180
Ma, they could shoot him
before he got home.

180
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:16,020
Straight from America features
Ms. Floud and Ms. Floud.

181
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,990
Glad to see you.

182
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:22,260
- Hello, Count.
- And I'm very glad to see you.

183
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,990
Come, you will see my family.

184
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:26,830
This is my mother, Lady Brinstead.

185
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:29,370
Flattered to meet you, Lady Brinstead.

186
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,810
- Haunted.
- Do it, Aggie.

187
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,240
Haunted.

188
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:36,540
And my cousin Rosalind, Duchess of Dover.

189
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,740
- Haunted.
- How are you.?

190
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,180
Aggie.

191
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:42,480
- Hello, Duchess.
- How are you?

192
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,850
His Excellency,
13th Earl of Brinstead, my father.

193
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:57,330
- He thinks I have sauce on them.
- Yes Yes. Dad! Dad!

194
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,200
Forget my father's enthusiasm.

195
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:04,410
I told him about you and this is his
way of showing his approval.

196
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,850
Did you hear that, Aggie?
The count told his father about us.

197
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:13,080
Someone should tell their mother
all about their father.

198
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:22,090
Hope you guys relax here at
Brinstead Manor. Eh, mother?

199
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,460
- Yes, we will do it.
- Yes.

200
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,160
¿Milord? Please.

201
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,830
A cigarette?

202
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,730
Nozzle.

203
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,780
Fire?

204
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:02,370
It's better than the service we
've had in a month

205
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,800
and Big Squaw.

206
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,770
Well, Humphrey anticipates my wishes.

207
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,980
How often do you have to stop it?

208
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:15,140
Stop it? Ah, stop it.

209
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:18,680
Very funny.
Cheerfully good.

210
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:22,620
- It was everything. Thanks, Humphrey.
- Thanks.

211
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,120
Well, mother?

212
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:27,560
I must commend George for his taste.

213
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:31,930
You will know that many young
American tourists are rude.

214
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,260
Is not true.
Right, Aggie?

215
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,770
Yes.

216
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,340
Let's go from here.

217
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,070
Does anyone play tennis?

218
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,270
How do you think about tennis
with weather like this?

219
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,880
Sorry.
I thought I was acting.

220
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:52,350
Cyril, you forget we have guests.

221
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,050
Mrs. Floud, Miss Floud,
my nephew, Lord Cyril.

222
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,480
How are you?

223
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,350
- Aggie.
- What?

224
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,650
How are you?

225
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:07,700
He will have to forgive Cyril.
Tennis is his obsession.

226
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:09,670
Yes.

227
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,960
- What about tea, mother?
- Sure, dear.

228
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,900
I will call.

229
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,010
Have you called, ma'am?

230
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,640
I was ready, Humphrey.

231
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:25,050
Why didn't you wait for
the doorbell to ring?, idiot.

232
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,850
Jamon.

233
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:33,050
You know, Earl, this is the first time
I 've seen a real English butler.

234
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:36,160
I saw one performing.

235
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:41,330
It was in Cheyenne.
We throw tomatoes at him.

236
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,500
And now we will have tea.

237
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:49,340
- How do you want it?
- What is the difference?

238
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,510
Indian tea is a
vitality-giving blend during bad weather.

239
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:59,020
While the Chinese import
increases the stimulus.

240
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:03,180
- What did you say?
- Has said...

241
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,790
"Indian tea is a
vitality-giving blend during bad weather,

242
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,620
"while the Chinese import
stimulus increases."

243
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,660
Lady?

244
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:15,860
- Well said, Humphrey.
- Thanks.

245
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,830
A knife.
Have a...? Do not.

246
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:20,560
May l?

247
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,340
This part is the strainer.

248
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,150
Fresh cut lemon?

249
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,920
Two points.

250
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,220
- A lump or two?
- I like two,

251
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:44,720
but since lately
I have eaten pork, better one.

252
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,190
In that case, may I suggest ...?

253
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:00,010
- Can I stir a little, Ma?
- Yes please.

254
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,990
Tea time.

255
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,820
Could you...?

256
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,790
Will you choose your tea, ma'am?

257
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,570
Soaked again!

258
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,710
It's quite a stir, Ma.

259
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,240
You should not do that.
Don't you have judgment?

260
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:35,470
They said to relax.

261
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,770
Stupid, always screwing up.
I explained how I should...

262
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,780
- Mother, mother! Please!
- It's the hot pipe, Ma.

263
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:44,150
How did you manage to be such an idiot?

264
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,060
Going to bed early and getting up early.

265
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,660
Is the answer.
Better do it with this.

266
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:52,320
Unfortunate occurrence
of an inevitable nature.

267
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,660
I recommend a cold shower.

268
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,800
- Shut!
- Do not.

269
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:59,490
You should not be here.
Go do something.

270
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:03,270
- Yes, ma'am. I'll go get cold tea.
- Watch this.

271
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,100
Honey.

272
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,370
Come on, I'll help her change.

273
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,180
Humphrey.

274
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,550
I've been looking for him.

275
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,560
- I want something solid.
- So soon, ma'am?

276
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,990
- How much do they pay him?
- Quite a lot, Mrs.

277
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,860
How much is enough?

278
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:31,030
Are you trying to relieve me of the service
of Your Excellency?

279
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,330
- Exactly!
- Impossible!

280
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:36,440
I cannot abandon His Excellency.
That would not be nice.

281
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:38,800
My family has always served the Brinstead.

282
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:42,680
My father, my grandfather,
my great-grandfather.

283
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,110
I can't go any further.

284
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,910
You have reasons to work for me.
It is already en route.

285
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:49,280
Please, ma'am, don't insist on it.

286
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:52,620
My ancestors are already frowning.

287
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:55,120
- Who is it?
- The great grandfather, Lord Cedric.

288
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:57,230
He became famous in the army.

289
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,560
What was he looking for in his shirt?

290
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:01,830
Pull up your pants from the inside.

291
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,670
A funny pose.

292
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,960
Funnier if you put your hand out, Mrs.

293
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:13,110
Hey, Humphrey,
you earn nothing between these paintings.

294
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,540
Take my card.

295
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:19,310
Go to my hotel and we'll make a deal.
Double salary.

296
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:22,780
Don't tempt me, ma'am.
I can resist any temptation.

297
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,410
My whim is steel, Humphrey.
When I want something...

298
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:28,790
Wow!

299
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:31,620
Oh yes! Mr / Ms.

300
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,090
My great-great-grandmother, splendid genet.

301
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:39,260
- Did you always ride like this?
- Angelic Betsy, no.

302
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,670
He often rode rider style.

303
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,280
If she did it in Big Squaw, she
would be arrested.

304
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,040
It was.
That's how he met great-great-grandfather.

305
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:48,940
He was a magistrate.

306
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,570
Well, I will have to continue, Mrs.

307
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:57,390
Now, put this hand lightly on the end.

308
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,250
- Slightly?
- Yes, slightly.

309
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:04,290
Of course, this game is
taught throughout England.

310
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,230
It is the most popular sport.

311
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,960
Playing it or teaching it?

312
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,100
- You know, Agatha...
- What?

313
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:15,300
He is the most exciting person I know.

314
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:18,810
If I knew the exact words,
if I knew what to do...

315
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,710
May I attend the service, my lord?

316
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:28,380
- Fast service. Jerez, Miss?
- Okay, I wasn't going to drink.

317
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:37,020
- Jerez, my lord?
- No, I don't take anything, thank you.

318
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,460
- Whiskey and soda, my lord?
- I want nothing.

319
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:41,460
- ¿Whisky con soda, milord?
- No.

320
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:44,000
"Soda and water, my lord?"
- Nothing at all.

321
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:45,430
Water with water?

322
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,500
"Whiskey on ice, my lord?"
- Nothing.

323
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,230
¿Whisky con whisky?

324
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:51,930
- That's all.
- Do I make music with the glasses?

325
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:54,980
We don't want to drink anything else.

326
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:58,140
Shall I draw the curtains, my lord?
Do I prepare your bath?

327
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,380
- Shall I make a portrait of you?
- Look, Humphrey,

328
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,280
do what you like, but elsewhere.

329
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,450
- Elsewhere.
- Yes, my lord.

330
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,520
Shall I chalk Miss's cue, my lord?

331
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:11,420
Why don't we give up until he stops?

332
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,160
Yes.

333
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:27,770
I'm terrible, sorry.

334
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,640
Now, Agatha, as I was saying...

335
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,880
Announcement to Sir Wimbley,
Mrs. Floud, Miss Rosalind...

336
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:37,410
You have to be with me, Aggie.

337
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,890
The count has told me things.

338
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,620
Billiards!

339
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,630
Can I get you a soda, ma'am?

340
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,170
Thanks.

341
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:18,150
- You know, Aggie...
- What?

342
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:20,990
I bet Humphrey would make
your father a knight.

343
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:23,960
Will you take it home with us?
Ma, are you nuts?

344
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,800
Do not worry. I'll get Humphrey
anyway.

345
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:30,140
- Ma.
- If Mrs. Maude fires him.

346
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:33,970
- Pa would put him to take care of pigs.
- Go on with the billiards.

347
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,450
- Punch, ma'am?
- I want nothing.

348
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,540
Nice hit, Mrs.

349
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,990
Some punch, ma'am?
You will feel the caress of the drink

350
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,090
and nap.

351
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,710
Punch, ma'am?

352
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,310
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

353
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:16,250
You... You... Get out!

354
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:19,190
You are fired!
I'm fed up!

355
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,420
And don't come back again!
Not today, not tomorrow, not ever!

356
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,960
And now out!

357
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:27,560
- It was an accident, my lord.
- Out of!

358
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:35,440
I know, out. I know.

359
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,670
Big Squaw.

360
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:50,620
- Hi Mike.
- Hello.

361
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:55,220
- Hello, Mr. Floud.
- Hello.

362
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,790
Hey, Pa.

363
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:03,400
Look, Cart.
Stop calling me "Pa"!

364
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:06,970
- What do you know about Aggie?
- He's on his way home.

365
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:10,635
<i>Big Squaw, New Mexico.</i>

366
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:12,170
<i>Arrival at Big Squaw on June 23.</i>

367
00:24:12,205 --> 00:24:13,435
<i>Put on a clean shirt.</i>

368
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:15,470
<i>Aggie and I bring in an English valet.</i>

369
00:24:15,505 --> 00:24:16,770
<i>With love. Effie.</i>

370
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,580
Hey, what's that "valet" thing?

371
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:23,910
The same as man of man.
Knight of knight.

372
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:26,920
Like a knight, when the
knight thinks he is a knight.

373
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,290
Good, but don't interfere with my plans.

374
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:32,230
Aggie and I are getting married
as soon as she's here.

375
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,090
- Now you know.
- Maybe the one who doesn't know is Aggie.

376
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:38,460
Ma wrote that an earl had his eyes on her.

377
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,570
And if it's him, you have a problem.

378
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,830
I think the problem is his.
I'm going to pick her up on the train.

379
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:45,700
You won't need a clean shirt

380
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,340
because the count will never see her, Pa.

381
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,110
Don't call me Pa!

382
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:10,060
Ma, mira. Cart Belknap.

383
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,940
What a rocking...

384
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,980
- Hi, Cart.
- Hello.

385
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:27,080
- Get away from my girl.
- Okay...

386
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:29,450
- She just...
- Hold it, boy.

387
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:32,060
Cart, leave him alone!

388
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,520
Wait, we are in a tunnel.

389
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:37,490
No one will marry Aggie except me.

390
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:40,200
Please don't dance here.
Please!

391
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:41,700
¡Cart!

392
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:44,840
- Please, we haven't been introduced.
- Cart!

393
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,740
Only a coward hits a coward.

394
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,980
¡Cart!

395
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:03,110
- Go get him, Aggie!
- Ma, let him go.

396
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:04,980
Go for him!

397
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,200
Do not worry.
Has jumped.

398
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:26,610
Hope it jumps all the way back to England.

399
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,300
Well, you'll go get it.

400
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,280
I paid for your trip first class,
and I'm not going to miss it now.

401
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,610
I will not do it!

402
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:38,720
If I don't bring it alive, you'll have
to prepare a shake.

403
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:40,950
¡Baja!

404
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,940
Water.

405
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,380
Water!

406
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,610
Water. Water.

407
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:10,990
I go crazy.
Water! Water!

408
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:18,560
Miracle. The heat.

409
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:20,600
I'm crazy!

410
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:22,930
Water.

411
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,840
Water.

412
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:28,670
Seltzer.
Water. Something.

413
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,670
He is drunk.

414
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,250
Aguilas.

415
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,600
Indians. Indians!

416
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:41,770
Hey, sabrootodo!
[Abelotodo]

417
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:09,470
What's the matter with you?
You've gone mad?

418
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:13,040
There is no time to explain it.
Here, hide behind there.

419
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:19,610
I'm going to brag.
I will challenge you.

420
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:21,180
I will flee!

421
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,150
We will die together.

422
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:35,030
What are you doing raving about giving up?

423
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,400
Indians.
Indian children!

424
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:40,200
- Hi, Aggie.
- Need help?

425
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:42,970
- No.
- What's wrong with him?

426
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,700
He thinks he has broken a twig for you.

427
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:49,140
Because his friends are good,
otherwise he would have killed them.

428
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:52,770
Yeah, how he killed Cart Belknap.
Indian children.

429
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:55,780
Is he the guy who tried to shoot me
in the feet?

430
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:58,950
- What have you got against me?
- Will you marry me.

431
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,560
I think he imagines that you
and I understand each other.

432
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:05,160
How can you imagine something
so ridiculous?

433
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:08,420
Absurd.
You are not my type, Mrs.

434
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,630
Same here, he would kill
anyone who touched me.

435
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,740
In that case, I will wait impatiently for a
long and happy life, Mrs.

436
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:22,270
- Come on, sabelotodo.
- Come on, Mrs.

437
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,940
- Come on, help me ride.
- Yes ma'am.

438
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,390
Do not! Not that way.

439
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:35,150
- Put your hands like this.
- Yes ma'am.

440
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,100
It was not very pleasant to do.

441
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:45,240
You should have warned your muscles.

442
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,240
- Yes ma'am.
- It's supposed to get me high.

443
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:49,840
Eleva. Eleva.

444
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:57,610
It is done.
Shall we canter, ma'am?

445
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:01,040
¿Sra.? ¿Sra.?

446
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,150
What are you doing down there?

447
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,550
Having tea with a groundhog.
What do you think?

448
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:09,260
Sorry, mrs.

449
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:10,690
Only me...

450
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,590
- Ready?
- Not that way.

451
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,360
- Get on all fours.
- Yes, Mrs.

452
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:18,100
We will do it safely.

453
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,700
- Are you on board, ma'am?
- Yes.

454
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,910
- Now give me your arm.
- Yes, Mrs.

455
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,170
Not that one, the other one.

456
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:29,750
- Now jump.
- Above. Upstairs, Mrs.

457
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,180
Here we are, Mrs.

458
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:40,420
Wouldn't it be easier to call a cab, ma'am?

459
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:42,320
I have a better idea.

460
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:44,490
- Go.
- Yes, Mrs.

461
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,960
When in the service of the count,

462
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:50,500
I never had to help him ride the horse.

463
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:53,540
He put his boots on in the morning
and took them off at night.

464
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:56,640
- There were never animals.
- Shut up.

465
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:58,470
- Get on the rock.
- Yes, Mrs.

466
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:03,170
- Facing the horse.
- To the horse?

467
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,620
Take off your hat.

468
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,270
¡Effie!

469
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,200
¡Effie!

470
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,640
¡Effie!

471
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,710
Yes?
Why do you scream

472
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:42,650
What the hell happened to my clothes?

473
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:45,290
I have burned it.
I got rid of it.

474
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,220
- Did you burn it?
- Yes.

475
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:49,990
Humphrey will buy you a
new outfit in the shop.

476
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,600
I don't want clothes from the store...
Humphrey?

477
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,360
- Who is Humphrey?
- The Butler.

478
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:55,800
Butler?

479
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:58,060
Yes, the one we brought with us.

480
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,170
You told Aggie to find a valet.

481
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,710
- That's Humphrey, the butler.
- I thought...

482
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,970
Thought what?

483
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,540
- Just thought.
- I doubt it.

484
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:12,680
And another thing, grab that
beat-up old rocking chair

485
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:15,290
and spit it out of here before he comes.

486
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:17,250
Right now.

487
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,190
Aggie.

488
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:29,700
- ¡Aggie!
- ¡Pa!

489
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:33,000
- Hi father!
- Aggie, what you have seen with your eyes.

490
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:37,570
Pa, in Europe I have not seen anything
better than you and our home.

491
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:40,440
How is it that you wear clothes for Sunday
being Tuesday?

492
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:45,050
Ma likes finery like a pig likes mud.

493
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,660
- Is dead?
- Do not.

494
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:56,120
He passed out when I hit him with a rock.

495
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:59,090
Now give him another stone.
Tell him he fell off his horse.

496
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:03,200
- No, Ma held me responsible.
- I'm in trouble, Aggie.

497
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:06,270
- How is that?
- I didn't know he was a butler.

498
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:10,880
I told everyone he was an earl.
They will give you a proper welcome.

499
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,240
God, when Ma finds out, what do I do?

500
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:15,710
Don't do anything, what's done is done.

501
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:20,280
And all for him.
Please, Aggie, give him a stone.

502
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:23,150
Pretend, Ma is coming.
I did it, Ma!

503
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,350
Great. We could...

504
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:30,650
- Aggie, if he's hurt, help me...
- Easy. It's healthy.

505
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:33,090
- He's well alive.
- Let's put him down.

506
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:46,540
There must be another way to see America.

507
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,040
What happens?
Can't get up?

508
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:51,380
Looks like something's wrong, Mrs.

509
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:53,240
We have to save him from that misfortune.

510
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:56,110
Yes, it will have to be buried in a barrel.

511
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:58,920
Bring it home!

512
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:07,730
I'm glad you're okay, Humphrey.

513
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,230
In a few days my misfortune will return.

514
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,990
I will help you improve.

515
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:16,400
This is Wampum, our worker.
And this is Wong, the cook.

516
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:18,910
- Guys, this is Humphrey.
- How are you?

517
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,670
- How? [Jául]
- Okay.

518
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:22,870
And that's Mr. Floud.

519
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,750
- Hello.
- Hello Sr.

520
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:33,360
Let me tell you something, Humphrey.
I know how to take care of myself.

521
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:35,320
- It is obvious.
- Look...

522
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:37,860
One moment.
I give the orders.

523
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:40,930
Humphrey, you can start by
instructing Mr. Floud

524
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,600
of the correct way to act.

525
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:45,730
- Well, you see, Mrs. Floud, I...
- Humphrey.

526
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:49,500
Well, may I suggest,
sir, in the presence of the ladies.

527
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:51,700
- Ladies?
- You mean me and Ma.

528
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:55,740
- Sassafras. [American tree]
- Now let's go up.

529
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:58,440
- Not until I have my clothes.
- Oh yeah?

530
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,950
Can I get
Mr. Floud some clothes, ma'am?

531
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:04,180
We will fill a
tub with water and bathe Mr. Floud!

532
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,980
- What?
- Bath, ma'am?

533
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,060
Yes.

534
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:09,490
- Now you see, Effie...
- Do it!

535
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,230
- You too.
- But...

536
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,070
- Humphrey.
- Yes, Ms...

537
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,540
- May I, sir?
- Yes Yes.

538
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,720
Delicious Could you ...?

539
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,130
Are you planning to shave now, sir?

540
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:51,400
Rest assured, Humphrey:

541
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:54,570
No one has bathed me since I was a child.

542
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:58,200
Effie can take my job off

543
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:01,170
But any fool who tries to give me a bath

544
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:04,080
I will cut it into pieces that cannot be
hung.

545
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:11,210
- He had picked up a gray hair.
- And now, get out of here.

546
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:13,820
And keep your mouth shut.

547
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:18,290
What's the matter, Humphrey?

548
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:20,520
You want to lather yourself, Mrs.

549
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:24,930
Well, while you wait,
put Aggie's hair back.

550
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:29,600
- Bring it, ma'am and I'll do it.
- No, Humphrey. Let's go there.

551
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:32,540
I want you to leave her as a duchess.

552
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:36,710
I haven't been with one in a while,
but I'll try.

553
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:43,380
Here it is.

554
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,260
May l?

555
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:48,120
What the hell is he doing?

556
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:51,290
- Humphrey will pick your hair up.
- I can do it myself.

557
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,450
He will leave you like a duchess.

558
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:56,160
- I don't want to sound like a duchess.
- Aggie!

559
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:58,890
Okay, what does he know
about the woman's hair?

560
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,640
That?

561
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:03,770
For 10 years I have been an employee
of Gómez in Paris,

562
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,410
as an expert in hairdressing.

563
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:08,770
- I dont believe it.
- See if I can with your "jungle."

564
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:10,680
Quiet, still.

565
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:14,780
I will never forget Lady Cunningham's hair.

566
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:17,950
He made me comb a huge bun for him.
It was amazing.

567
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,450
- What nonsense.
- Yes.

568
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,090
All the people said:

569
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,520
"There goes Lady Cunningham,
with her bun on top."

570
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,890
The people were picturesque.
Now...

571
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,760
I should do something with inspiration,
something with a point.

572
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:36,530
An exceptional creation.
A monument to me.

573
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,140
I need a team.
Is there a rat or two around here?

574
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:43,350
- Why don't you look in the mirror?
- You got it right.

575
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:48,350
I'll do something elevated,
something statuesque.

576
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,120
No, it is not enough.

577
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,030
No.

578
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:59,260
Why...

579
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,290
eureka.

580
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:03,630
Eureka, yes.

581
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:11,240
Magnificent.

582
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:14,510
My masterpiece.

583
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,750
Hopefully this is not the time to spray.

584
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,680
Miss.
Don't look at yourself until it's over.

585
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:24,920
I can't stand flattery.

586
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,410
You...

587
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:00,560
You are taking a bath, Mr.

588
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:02,890
Take off your change of clothes.
The water is not cold.

589
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,860
Wait, when I catch you,
I'll break your neck.

590
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,680
Are you.

591
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:25,610
Live! I was looking for her to
see the result.

592
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:29,690
- Humphrey, it has been exceeded.
- I think so.

593
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:32,820
- It's amazing.
- Yes, I was amazed.

594
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:36,520
Maybe I made the toupee a little high,
but I'll fix it later.

595
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:39,390
I'll think something.
Maybe practicing a little,

596
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,900
get it curled with my fingers.

597
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:54,710
- Good afternoon, Your Grace.
- How are you?

598
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:59,370
- Greetings, Mr. Count.
- Ladies, all together.

599
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:02,310
Welcome to Big Squaw, Your Grace.

600
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:04,420
¿Su Graz ...?

601
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:08,050
Soy Jones, editor del Daily Chronicle.

602
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:11,420
Welcome to Big Squaw, the largest
town west of Wagonwheel.

603
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,000
- How are you?
- I'm Andrews, the undertaker.

604
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:16,070
At first I came west to dig for gold.

605
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:18,200
Yeah sure, it
doesn't make sense to spend a shovel

606
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:21,100
Your Grace, I want to introduce you
to my daughter.

607
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:24,640
- She's a bit shy. [Afraid]
- Afraid of what?

608
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:27,000
Glad to see you all, dear ones.

609
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:29,940
- Effie, how lucky.
- Congratulations.

610
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:34,540
- And your guest. Effie, what a prize.
- You. what does Humphrey think?

611
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:38,110
His name is Humphrey, it is
his first name, serious as his face.

612
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:40,420
I knew Humphrey would cause a stir

613
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:42,420
but I had no idea it would come to this.

614
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:45,720
Every woman would give something to
be in her shoes.

615
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,160
Thank you dear.

616
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:49,930
Effie, this is the biggest story
my journal has ever published.

617
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,830
You've put Big Squaw on the map.

618
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,700
- What?
- Don't tell me you haven't seen it.

619
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:58,970
"Mrs. Mike Floud introduces
the Earl of Bri ..."

620
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:01,410
"Count of..."

621
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,980
This makes you the queen
of Big Squaw society.

622
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:07,990
Me? Queen?

623
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:10,290
What nonsense, right?

624
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,520
Let your honor think

625
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:19,220
which is nonsense, it
is pampering the visitors too much.

626
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,660
Right, Your Honor?

627
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:25,030
- But...
- His neck.

628
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,470
I'll double his salary, I'll
double everything.

629
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:31,370
Well, like Humphrey, Earl of Brinstead,

630
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,270
and from my hostess,

631
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,770
I welcome you to Floud Mansion.

632
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:41,850
Your Honor, 2 minutes past teatime.

633
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:45,580
- How can you hold on?
- With arrests.

634
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:48,220
Shall we have tea?

635
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,460
His daughter looks like the Duchess
of Murdock.

636
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:58,290
- The Duchess?
- Many afternoons we have tea,

637
00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:03,170
the Duchess and I, while her husband
plays his favorite sport.

638
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:06,180
- The cricket?
- Maybe not, but she's irresistible.

639
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:11,510
A happy group, right?

640
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,980
Will you sit here, Your Honor?

641
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:24,990
- Pa, the whole city is down there...
- Yes, I can hear them.

642
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:28,060
He is bad as a butler,
and here you will not be able to live,

643
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:30,930
now that everyone believes him count.
We have to...

644
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,530
- What are you doing with that bird?
- That know-it-all did it to me.

645
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:37,370
- Shut.
- Aggie...

646
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:39,130
- What?
- Humphrey has to go.

647
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:40,970
- I know how to do it.
- Yes?

648
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:43,340
- And Ma can't blame us.
- Good.

649
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:46,040
Belknap thinks there is something
between Humphrey and me.

650
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:50,450
- Yes?
- Suppose I let him keep believing it.

651
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:55,220
Cart would cut up his liver and
dip it in his own sauce.

652
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:57,690
Marching an order for liver.

653
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:03,070
Yes, I enjoy my best walk in America.

654
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:05,500
Can you compare the
American and English women?

655
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:09,270
I think the American woman
is much prettier.

656
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,700
What about their horses?

657
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,810
I think American women are
prettier than our horses.

658
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:16,450
Sorry for being late.

659
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:19,780
- Hello everyone.
- Hi, Aggie.

660
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:22,510
- Aggie.
- What?

661
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:27,220
Don't you know you have to ask
Humphrey if you can come into the room?

662
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:29,050
Yes, Ma, I know.

663
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:31,700
Dear, dear earl, what can Miss Maude say?

664
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:34,920
- No carnation in his buttonhole.
- I can't take them.

665
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:38,070
This would rust my medals.
Pass this out.

666
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:42,000
- Please tell us about your medals.
- Yes, let's talk ahead.

667
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:45,440
I've seen it in action.
It's cold like an old bathtub.

668
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:48,770
Yes. One of the things you've done has made
my hair stand on end.

669
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:51,240
Tell me about an experience for my journal.

670
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:54,980
No no no please!
Your Honor is very tired.

671
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:58,350
- It has been a very busy day.
- Not much, not much.

672
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:02,650
Let me see,
how do I explain my first medal?

673
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:06,730
Thanks. Well, I think it was my
first year of service out of the East.

674
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:10,730
It was my first year of service.
At the same time he was a simple lieutenant.

675
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,870
Well, those dirty natives were very dirty.

676
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,130
They had promoted the malaise for weeks.

677
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:17,830
They wanted to eliminate us.

678
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:20,940
And they waited for the end of the monsoon.

679
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:23,570
Monsoon, in French for sir.
[Monsieur]

680
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:24,670
Exactly.

681
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:27,310
The infernal drums sounded.

682
00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:34,390
"The bullying hour," he said,
"is when the drums stop."

683
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,580
The infernal drums stopped.
I was distraught.

684
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,750
But he was the
bravest man outside the East.

685
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:45,270
Colonel Jothergill took me aside.

686
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,340
"We are 3 against 1,000"
We had to call for reinforcements.

687
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:51,840
- No man could pass.
- The earl was a boy then.

688
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:53,310
Colonel Jothergill.

689
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:58,540
Called "Old Saliva and Polish."
He always spit, and he was Polish.

690
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:02,310
Well, sir, old Colonel Jothergill
outlined his plan for me.

691
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:06,150
I offered to move on.
It was a dangerous mission.

692
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:09,690
Behind us was a river,
dark and infested with crocodiles.

693
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:12,350
To the right the jungle full of
hissing pythons.

694
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:15,160
And the earl whistled like them, didn't he?

695
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:17,260
Yes.

696
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:20,840
On the left, a wall of high rocks.

697
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:23,200
And in front, the enemy.

698
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:25,340
Three against 1,000.

699
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,080
Horrible!

700
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:31,310
Exciting though.
Dawn was coming in the East.

701
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:34,510
Our souls fell in the West.

702
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:37,020
Three against 1,000.

703
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:38,710
What chance did we have?

704
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:40,910
And when the sun rose, they attacked.

705
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:43,580
Soon we would have finished.
We knew it.

706
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,360
We shook hands, we distributed
the last portions of food,

707
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:50,630
the last drops of water.

708
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,130
The ammunition practically depleted.

709
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:56,430
Then Colonel Jothergill told us the worst.

710
00:46:56,610 --> 00:46:58,170
"Stiff upper lip," he murmured.

711
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:00,210
"You guys will have to face this."

712
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:02,180
There is no more tea.

713
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:06,310
They had to pay dearly for it.
We would sell life at a high price.

714
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,280
How to stop them?
How to get out of that? How?

715
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:11,480
- Like. [Jául]
- Like.

716
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:15,020
There was no more time.
We heard their hideous howls.

717
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:18,060
There they were, storming the fortress.
They were going to stab us.

718
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:21,630
Screaming, with spears and machetes.
Disintegrating the British plaza.

719
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,290
Three against 1,000.

720
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:26,160
Three, watching.

721
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,370
You are wonderful.

722
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:38,810
There I was, with a spear piercing my body.

723
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:40,970
- Didn't it hurt?
- Only when he laughed.

724
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:43,620
I pulled the spear and began to attack.

725
00:47:43,790 --> 00:47:47,420
Colonel Jothergill, attacking
to my right, was shot down.

726
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:49,990
That angered me.
I brandished my machete

727
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,390
I made my way between them.
Stabbing, stabbing.

728
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:56,330
Heads, arms, legs, bodies!

729
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,990
There it was, drenched in blood.

730
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:00,830
Blood!

731
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:03,300
Wet with blood.

732
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:06,670
Blood.

733
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,840
Bien, Sr. Belknap.

734
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:15,090
Poor guy. He has not endured
the bloody tale.

735
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:19,850
Excuse me. I always take a nap
before going to bed. If you are...

736
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:22,390
But Your Honor!
What happened?

737
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,690
- How was the end?
- Ah, the meeting!

738
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,690
Well, they finally left.

739
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:30,660
They were the most resistant of all
that we had fought.

740
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,860
Good, goodnight.

741
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:36,000
Goodnight.

742
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,250
What work.

743
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,390
You can enter.

744
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:05,030
Get out of bed and head
to the Yellow Dog Lounge.

745
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:08,470
Those two bad bugs, Pa and Aggie,
they went there dressed in suede.

746
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,630
- They have rebelled!
- But Effie,

747
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:12,710
a count is not disturbed.

748
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,180
The earl feels very earnest this morning.

749
00:49:15,350 --> 00:49:19,370
Humphrey, in the Morning Chronicle
you may be an earl,

750
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:21,680
before my friends you can be a count,

751
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:26,220
But I pay Humphrey, the butler.

752
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:31,290
- And his job is Pa and Aggie.
- But Mrs. Floud, I...

753
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:33,190
Humphrey.

754
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:34,700
Yes, Mrs.

755
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:36,220
Yes, Mrs.

756
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,130
And my hat?

757
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:41,600
He wore a tall silk hat and a long tailcoat

758
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,930
I looked like O'Leary's goat

759
00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:46,580
Cantando you do yayyi yay, yayyi yay

760
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:48,770
Cantando you do yiyi yayyi yay

761
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:51,470
This is bacon and beans Every day

762
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:54,170
I had to eat soon in the hay meadow

763
00:49:54,350 --> 00:49:56,720
Cantando you do yayyi yay, yayyi yay

764
00:49:56,890 --> 00:49:59,320
Cantando you do yiyi yayyi yay

765
00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:02,150
My feet in the stirrups roye by the side

766
00:50:02,330 --> 00:50:04,520
Show me a horse that I ca n't ride

767
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:06,930
Cantando you do yayyi yay, yayyi yay

768
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:11,260
Cantando you do yiyi yayyi yay

769
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:12,990
Pa, look who's here.

770
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:18,670
Guys, our guest, the Earl of Beerstein.

771
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,640
I beg your pardon, gentlemen,
the Earl of Brinstead.

772
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:25,410
What is the difference?
Come on, guys, let's drink beer.

773
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:29,640
The mother asks both of them to
return to the mansion.

774
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:32,020
What about our manners here?

775
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:35,280
Why? I'll escort you both
to Mrs.

776
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:36,790
Relax, Count.

777
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,930
Come on, we'll discuss it.
Before we wet the throat.

778
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:41,360
Bring some beer.

779
00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:44,020
I would stay, but we have to go.

780
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:47,260
- You know the lady.
- Sure, Humphrey. Sure.

781
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:52,340
This morning we go out and she is crazy
if we come home moderate,

782
00:50:52,510 --> 00:50:55,480
but it will be more so if we come back
with breath smelling of beer,

783
00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:56,980
Will you forget how we got away

784
00:50:57,150 --> 00:50:58,980
- Let's have a beer.
- It's too late...

785
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:03,310
Forget it. Sam! Come on, Sam!
Hurry up with that beer!

786
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,490
For Jove, they are alive!

787
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,760
Jolly.

788
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:22,000
Sorry.

789
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:23,700
Thanks.

790
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:32,880
Here, count.

791
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:34,680
Thanks.

792
00:51:35,890 --> 00:51:37,290
Excuse me

793
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:42,760
Bring Cart!

794
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:48,890
Sabelotodo

795
00:51:49,070 --> 00:51:50,800
You are a dry law bug

796
00:51:50,970 --> 00:51:52,700
When you see a girl you jump

797
00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:54,200
Hey you!

798
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:56,500
Sabelotodo

799
00:51:56,670 --> 00:51:58,640
You dropped your pretty handkerchief

800
00:51:58,810 --> 00:52:00,780
Mama will spank us

801
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:04,370
Fauntleroy

802
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:06,280
Women who crave men

803
00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:08,680
They want to love troglodytes

804
00:52:08,850 --> 00:52:11,980
Come on angel

805
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,890
Show courage

806
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:15,750
That's what you need

807
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,130
Sabelotodo

808
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:20,920
You're a bloated old man

809
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:22,930
You are afraid to catch a girl and hold her

810
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:25,190
Hey you!

811
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:26,730
Sabelotodo

812
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:29,070
Run to protect you Ma

813
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,040
How is your stamp collection?

814
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:34,630
Underpants

815
00:52:34,810 --> 00:52:38,480
Look how we stomp

816
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:41,810
What scares you?
Take a chance

817
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:44,150
If you like to roam and snoop

818
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:46,020
People will stop screaming

819
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:48,990
"That's where sabotage goes"

820
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:03,700
Sabelotodo.

821
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:50,150
Hunter.

822
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:03,530
Remember my throat was slightly slit

823
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:06,930
and I had to keep my head
because the handkerchief was torn.

824
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:10,560
If I could go back to base,
I would recover in 15 days.

825
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:13,470
Five days, you know.
Then it happened.

826
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:14,940
- What?
- Throughout Africa,

827
00:54:15,110 --> 00:54:17,910
I have never seen a more ferocious beast.

828
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:20,440
There I was standing in a black night

829
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:24,080
its immense size dwarfed
the elephant I was riding.

830
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:26,280
How could you tell the size in the dark?

831
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:28,720
The dark night let his
white coat stand out.

832
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:31,090
You see, when...

833
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:34,290
Hola, Sr. Belknap.

834
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:36,900
Well, it's snack time.
I'm going to walk.

835
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:38,630
No, count.

836
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:41,770
- I'd like to hear the rest.
- You better be careful.

837
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:44,240
You know what happened last night.

838
00:54:44,410 --> 00:54:46,540
Maybe this time I will catch him.

839
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:49,200
Ok, if you like risk.
Where was it?

840
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:51,900
Staring at a huge animal in the dark.

841
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,350
That? Ah, that was it.
Yes Yes Yes.

842
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:57,920
Well, his white coat highlighted the
biggest polar bear I've ever seen.

843
00:54:58,090 --> 00:55:00,450
- It must have been...
- Those don't belong to Africa.

844
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:02,960
That's what I was going to tell him.
He approached.

845
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:04,990
I was withdrawing, step by step.

846
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:06,930
What happened to the big elephant?

847
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:08,720
I sent him help.

848
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:11,560
I think. Yes.
Well, there he was.

849
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:13,860
I stood there unarmed except for a spear

850
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:16,330
that a native nailed in my chest.

851
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:18,710
- That it only hurt to laugh.
- Yes.

852
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:25,440
I staggered off the spear,
weak from loss of blood.

853
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:29,280
I was all blood.
It was dripping blood!

854
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:32,010
Even the bear was.

855
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:35,050
Not feeling a slight faint?
Do not.

856
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,990
Did I say that the ground was
covered in blood?

857
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:41,290
As I said. It's snack time.
The best thing is to walk...

858
00:55:41,470 --> 00:55:43,300
Do you know what I would have done?

859
00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:46,370
- Well, I...
- I would have twisted his neck like that!

860
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:47,800
What?

861
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:51,870
Then he would have grabbed his ears
and ripped them off like that!

862
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,980
I wish I had been there.

863
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:58,510
Then with his skin in my
hands I would have skinned him!

864
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:01,120
- Well...
- Pa, we have to stop Cart.

865
00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:03,010
It's getting hotter.

866
00:56:03,190 --> 00:56:06,120
I want Humphrey to do something
and Cart will let him go.

867
00:56:06,290 --> 00:56:09,280
I don't think Humphrey stood up to Cart.

868
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:12,020
- And do you know what would follow?
- No. Let me guess.

869
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:15,960
- Okay, go ahead and guess.
- You would have taken the rifle

870
00:56:16,130 --> 00:56:18,160
and I would have shot him like that.

871
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,240
Goodbye!

872
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:35,380
Very good, huh, Effie?

873
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:39,280
Mr. Mayor, this is so
big it scares me!

874
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:41,120
President Teddy Roosevelt!

875
00:56:41,290 --> 00:56:43,780
He's on a tour of the Western territory.

876
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:47,450
I wouldn't have played Big Squaw, but
when I telegraphed about the earl,

877
00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:51,030
He replied that it would be a pleasure!

878
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,000
O'Goshen Land.

879
00:56:53,170 --> 00:56:55,830
Of course he can stay here with you, right?

880
00:56:56,010 --> 00:56:58,570
Here? At my place?

881
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:01,340
It would be a great compliment.

882
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:03,270
Maybe if we treat it very well

883
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:06,580
I would recommend to Congress the exchange
of this territory for a State.

884
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:08,780
- Land of lands!
- And Effie...

885
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:12,440
You. would be the queen of the state!
- Mayor!

886
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:15,920
I am going to organize the City Council.
Goodbye, Effie.

887
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:18,220
Congratulations, Aggie!
Congratulations, Mike!

888
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,920
President Roosevelt comes to see Humphrey.

889
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:23,230
Is not it wonderful?
Mike!

890
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:24,660
- What?
- I swear

891
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,930
who said the President is
coming to see Humphrey.

892
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:29,700
That's what I said.
Is not it wonderful?

893
00:57:29,870 --> 00:57:33,170
- Ma, have you drunk brandy?
- No, Mike, it's true!

894
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:35,000
Why would you want to see Humphrey?

895
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:37,150
Because he thinks Humphrey is an earl.

896
00:57:37,310 --> 00:57:39,010
Where is Humphrey?

897
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:41,080
¿Humphrey?

898
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:43,780
Teddy Roosevelt, huh?
Well, I'll be tied up by pig.

899
00:57:43,950 --> 00:57:47,190
- Where's Humphrey?
- Go ahead and tell him.

900
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:50,450
The last time we saw him, he was
leaving town.

901
00:57:50,630 --> 00:57:53,620
- Leaving town?
- Yes, he was going to...

902
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:56,030
It was suddenly decided to go to London.

903
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:59,070
Both of you!
I was not expecting something like this!

904
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:01,730
- We did not do anything!
- Take your horse and look for it!

905
00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:04,870
- Don't come back without him!
- We could have a problem.

906
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,280
The worst problem is that we can't
find it. Walking!

907
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:09,810
And you. Take off those clothes!

908
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:12,540
I'm going, wait a minute.
Easy, that's what I was going to do.

909
00:58:19,390 --> 00:58:21,050
¡Humphrey!

910
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:22,860
Wait!

911
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:35,800
Hey, know it all!

912
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:07,960
What this, time control?
Leave me alone. I want to get out of here.

913
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:11,010
Well, I don't blame him.
Pa and I have it very bad.

914
00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:14,080
Cart Belknap is not exactly
the chamber of commerce.

915
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:16,940
Leave. It's the only good thing
I can do since I arrived.

916
00:59:17,110 --> 00:59:19,050
I don't ask him to come back, Ma sent me.

917
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:22,190
- I knew you would say no.
- Well, you knew the right thing to do.

918
00:59:22,450 --> 00:59:25,720
I got nervous when he got Cart's face wet.

919
00:59:25,890 --> 00:59:28,760
So I figured you could
meet President Roosevelt.

920
00:59:28,930 --> 00:59:33,330
Yes, I had the courage to face it.
He won't think I'm...

921
00:59:34,230 --> 00:59:35,600
Who?

922
00:59:35,770 --> 00:59:38,460
You see, everyone at Big Squaw thinks
you're really an earl.

923
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:41,260
Teddy Roosevelt is coming
to town to meet him.

924
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:44,640
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>So President Roosevelt is
coming to meet the Earl of Brinstead</font>

925
00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:48,240
and not the count.
Well, you seem silly.

926
00:59:48,410 --> 00:59:52,250
His mother and father and the small
town seem silly.

927
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:54,610
They will have to change the name to
Big Fool.

928
00:59:55,590 --> 00:59:58,180
Yes, and it could be worse if you stay.

929
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:01,450
You may be able to make people believe
that you are an earl,

930
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:04,790
but I do acknowledge that President Roosevelt
will meet with several real earls.

931
01:00:04,830 --> 01:00:07,990
Presidents can be crazy.
They vote for them, right?

932
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:12,030
- I made him think I was a butler.
- Right, he did.

933
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:16,270
I have waited a long time to receive
a gesture for my performance.

934
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:19,430
I am not a count. No butler.
I've never been Humphrey.

935
01:00:19,610 --> 01:00:22,310
My name is Arthur Tyler and I am an actor.

936
01:00:22,550 --> 01:00:26,710
- Actor? God!
- If you let my wagon out, I'm going.

937
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,650
Why has he pretended to be a butler?

938
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:30,750
In London he was unemployed, broke.

939
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:34,290
So much so that they threw me out
of the hotel without opening the door.

940
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:37,450
I would make President Roosevelt
believe that I am the Earl of Brinstead.

941
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:38,350
But I do not want.

942
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:40,360
If you are an actor, you have your chance.

943
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:43,300
If you perform well, it will be the great
performance of your life.

944
01:00:43,470 --> 01:00:46,260
Imagine acting as an English earl
for President Roosevelt,

945
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:49,030
Me, Ma and Pa clapping.

946
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:52,340
Yes, and me being the star.
One step up.

947
01:00:52,510 --> 01:00:54,670
And an audience of three.
It is a step up.

948
01:00:54,850 --> 01:00:58,210
Yeah, you put Big Squaw on the map,
and they can't erase it anymore.

949
01:00:58,380 --> 01:01:01,180
Many innocent people in
the city will depend on you.

950
01:01:01,350 --> 01:01:03,180
Innocent.
How Cart Belknap?

951
01:01:03,350 --> 01:01:05,220
Tell him there's nothing between us

952
01:01:05,390 --> 01:01:08,090
and stop trying to put my head as a trophy.

953
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:11,860
Sure, I'll tell you there's never been
anything between us.

954
01:01:12,030 --> 01:01:13,720
You can be perfectly sure.

955
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:16,870
And later, when the President is
gone, you can go too.

956
01:01:17,470 --> 01:01:21,460
Arrea! President Roosevelt.
An executive command.

957
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:24,470
I accept the role,
but for one performance only.

958
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:28,270
Then I'll do a tour.
Wherever, but far away.

959
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:31,380
Everyone will thank you for this.

960
01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:34,640
And I on behalf of all, Arthur.

961
01:01:36,050 --> 01:01:37,680
Grab it!

962
01:01:37,850 --> 01:01:41,050
Yes, President Roosevelt,
I am the Earl of Brinstead.

963
01:01:43,130 --> 01:01:45,790
Wait for my agent to hear this.

964
01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:48,320
Let's go there.

965
01:01:58,830 --> 01:02:00,320
Society column

966
01:02:00,330 --> 01:02:01,920

01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:04,910
Misfortune is mine that goes with me

968
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:09,850
I hate this life chosen for me
Tired of so much misery

969
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:12,420

Homemade food

972
01:02:17,090 --> 01:02:20,650
Life is cruel I was a fool to roam

973
01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:23,590
A tramp earns nothing

974
01:02:23,770 --> 01:02:26,330
Only win the betrayal of an accomplice

975
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:28,430
You see the world, which is applesauce

976
01:02:28,510 --> 01:02:31,240
You never have your nose too far

977
01:02:31,410 --> 01:02:33,070

I know a girl Her name is Sal

981
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:44,520
I want to have it in my corral

982
01:02:44,690 --> 01:02:46,750

- Smoke rings with the pipe of peace
- Rice cake, kunquat, abundance

01:04:30,530 --> 01:04:31,990
- Ma!
- What?

1015
01:04:32,230 --> 01:04:33,890
Everyone to their posts.

1016
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:39,190
The President arrives at our house.

1017
01:04:39,370 --> 01:04:41,060
Dear boy.

1018
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:43,700
I hope they do everything well.

1019
01:04:43,870 --> 01:04:47,470
The Mayor and the welcoming committee
will bring you here from the station.

1020
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:50,670
Outside on the porch,
the Silver Cornet Band will be playing.

1021
01:04:50,850 --> 01:04:54,250
And Humphrey, you'll wait on the
stairs with your monocle,

1022
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:58,480
and his evening gown until the
boy with the horn blows "Ta-da."

1023
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:01,420
- "Ta-da".
- Then you will go down the stairs.

1024
01:05:01,590 --> 01:05:03,960
Everyone will clap as you go
down the stairs

1025
01:05:04,130 --> 01:05:07,120
and Pa will introduce you to Mr. Roosevelt.

1026
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:08,690
- And you, Aggie.
- What?

1027
01:05:08,870 --> 01:05:11,360
If you forget to bow,
I'll take you out of the spotlight.

1028
01:05:11,530 --> 01:05:13,660
- Agree.
- The party must be perfect

1029
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:16,740
- or you will suffer the consequences.
- Yes, Ma.

1030
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:20,840
- They call, Mrs.
- They call, they call.

1031
01:05:21,010 --> 01:05:24,810
Stop calling me ma'am.
You are the Earl of Brinstead.

1032
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:27,580
It will be Carrie with her potato salad.

1033
01:05:28,150 --> 01:05:31,140
Humphrey, I want to tell you
that the best of you.

1034
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:34,020
is that he is a count again despite
how we have treated him.

1035
01:05:34,190 --> 01:05:35,990
All right, old friend.

1036
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:39,190
- If you want, you can call me Pa.
- Thanks, Pa.

1037
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:46,960
What a taste!

1038
01:05:47,270 --> 01:05:51,640
I hope Carrie didn't load up on
the onion potato salad.

1039
01:05:53,010 --> 01:05:56,070
- Okay, get her in.
- How are you, Mrs. Floud?

1040
01:05:58,950 --> 01:06:00,440
Passed out

1041
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:02,880
Put her on that chair.

1042
01:06:03,050 --> 01:06:06,510
- It's the bad thing about surprising, Mr. Pte.
- That's it.

1043
01:06:09,390 --> 01:06:10,920
It will be fine.

1044
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:16,360
I'm coming. I'm coming.
Who is wrong, friends?

1045
01:06:16,970 --> 01:06:18,850
- What's wrong with Mrs. Floud?
- He passed out.

1046
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,440
- Don't stay there, I'll bring water.
- Without fail.

1047
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:23,500
I was very excited.

1048
01:06:23,670 --> 01:06:26,300
The President is coming and
we are all nervous.

1049
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:29,340
I'll give you some brandy.
It's not very good, but it will do.

1050
01:06:29,510 --> 01:06:31,240
I believe that...

1051
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:42,250
¡Aggie! ¡Pa! ¡Pa! ¡Aggie!

1052
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:45,920
- What happens?
- What?

1053
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:47,900
President!

1054
01:06:51,230 --> 01:06:53,330
Welcome to Big Squaw,
Mr. President.

1055
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:55,900
I am Mike Floud.
And there is my daughter Aggie.

1056
01:06:56,070 --> 01:06:58,940
How are you.?
And this is the Earl of Brinstead.

1057
01:06:59,110 --> 01:07:02,080
And this is our host,
Mrs. Effie Floud.

1058
01:07:02,250 --> 01:07:04,210
- Wake up, Ma.
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Floud.

1059
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:07,710
I arrived unexpectedly.
We drove the Broken Arrow.

1060
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:09,910
I should have stayed on the official train.

1061
01:07:10,090 --> 01:07:12,580
But I've heard so many welcome speeches

1062
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:15,190
he hoped to avoid the one at his station.

1063
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:17,620
I hope you will excuse our appearance.

1064
01:07:17,630 --> 01:07:20,490
We would leave the kitchen,
to prepare something for you.

1065
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:23,500
Yes, even the count.
He's very good at cleaning.

1066
01:07:23,670 --> 01:07:25,960
Yes, it is as normal as your democracy, Mr.

1067
01:07:26,140 --> 01:07:28,900
You know, when in Rome
and all those things.

1068
01:07:29,610 --> 01:07:33,340
Aggie, take the President into the living
room before things sort out in the kitchen.

1069
01:07:33,510 --> 01:07:35,600
Please leave the formality,
Mrs. Floud.

1070
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:37,910
I'd like to go to the kitchen with you.

1071
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:39,710
- May l?
- Really?

1072
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:42,680
I'll make a steak in sauce, it
's very popular in Washington.

1073
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:44,410
- It will?
- Extraordinary!

1074
01:07:44,590 --> 01:07:47,490
- I learned in Paris.
- Paris cooks!

1075
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:50,920
- You are our man.
- He is the most exquisite President.

1076
01:07:51,090 --> 01:07:54,620
- Everyone to the kitchen!
- Delicious. Bravo for you.

1077
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:59,730
- And to think that I almost voted for Bryan!
- This is a pressure group, right?

1078
01:08:00,170 --> 01:08:02,930
- It is done.
- Good looking, right?

1079
01:08:03,110 --> 01:08:05,600
- Give me some.
- I'm anxious ahead of time.

1080
01:08:07,410 --> 01:08:10,170
- Amazing!
- Like he said, delicious!

1081
01:08:10,350 --> 01:08:13,410
- Thanks thanks.
- You need more sherry.

1082
01:08:13,580 --> 01:08:15,410
- Bye.
- Stop, Ma.

1083
01:08:15,590 --> 01:08:18,550
I haven't had a drink since
I took that hit.

1084
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:21,450
Yes, and Pa is too old
to climb those hills.

1085
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:24,420
- Agatha!
- Maybe another jet wouldn't hurt.

1086
01:08:24,590 --> 01:08:27,360
No way! Keep your nose
on the presidential recipe.

1087
01:08:27,530 --> 01:08:30,290
- In my opinion...
- Nobody is interested.

1088
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:33,560
There was a lot of sherry in your
kitchen before we got married.

1089
01:08:33,740 --> 01:08:35,670
Mike Floud!
Are you hinting...

1090
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:39,270
Ma, if you had used stronger sherry,
I would be two years older.

1091
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:41,640
Do not get into this!
And you, Mike Floud...

1092
01:08:41,810 --> 01:08:45,680
- Don't start with that argument.
- Mr / Ms. Floud! Mr. Floud!

1093
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:48,410
After all, the President is on vacation.

1094
01:08:48,580 --> 01:08:51,020
You want me to think he's back in Congress?

1095
01:08:51,190 --> 01:08:52,480
Excuse me, Mr. President.

1096
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:55,180
I have overheard discussions
like this in my own kitchen.

1097
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:57,760
And I must say that my wife
has convinced me,

1098
01:08:57,930 --> 01:09:01,090
that I have the same
right to have an opinion.

1099
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:02,530
Is not true.

1100
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:05,260
You think the first lady has the last word.

1101
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:08,930
Well aimed, Brinstead.
Now some butter.

1102
01:09:09,110 --> 01:09:11,270
The butter is there.

1103
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:13,500
Is not it wonderful?

1104
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:16,840
Yes, this role of earl,
it makes me seem very low...

1105
01:09:17,010 --> 01:09:19,500
- Brinstead.
- I'm coming, Mr.

1106
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:23,940
Tell me, Brinstead,
what is England's position

1107
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:26,080
in relation to the situation
in the Mediterranean?

1108
01:09:26,220 --> 01:09:31,220
Yes. You see, there are two lines of
thought: Pro and Con.

1109
01:09:31,390 --> 01:09:34,660
Sure, but what do you think pros and cons?

1110
01:09:34,830 --> 01:09:39,600
The pros seem to be in favor,
and the group against are opposites.

1111
01:09:39,770 --> 01:09:42,970
Naturally.
And you personally, Brinstead,

1112
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:47,080
- What party do you take?
- Me? Yeah well I'm pro.

1113
01:09:47,710 --> 01:09:49,140
Why? Brinstead.

1114
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:52,280
How can you support a situation
that only creates problems?

1115
01:09:52,450 --> 01:09:58,680
Well, I think I'm pro-contra.
I am in favor of the opposite.

1116
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:04,190
He wasn't on the train!

1117
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:07,760
I, Democratic nominee, have
waited at the station for 1 hour.

1118
01:10:07,930 --> 01:10:12,160
My entire speech written by hand.
And I won't be able to read it in public...

1119
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:14,990
- Good Lord, it's him!
- Where is he going?

1120
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:17,300
The committee waits in front of the porch!

1121
01:10:17,470 --> 01:10:18,740
Let's go.

1122
01:10:18,910 --> 01:10:23,310
Well, Brinstead, there is no choice.
But we have done well to try.

1123
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:26,280
It was good while it lasted,
Mr. President. Go?

1124
01:10:26,450 --> 01:10:29,320
- Ma, where is my neck and tie?
- On the hotplate.

1125
01:10:29,490 --> 01:10:31,110
¡Dated prisa!

1126
01:10:37,490 --> 01:10:40,090
Sr. President,
as Mayor of Big Squaw,

1127
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:42,360
let me welcome you to our beautiful city.

1128
01:10:42,630 --> 01:10:46,800
Bravo Bravo! Excellent public
speaking. Brief and full-bodied.

1129
01:10:46,970 --> 01:10:50,670
- Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Thank you all.
- But Mr. President, there is more.

1130
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:54,640
- Good. He mails it to me.
- Yes, everyone for food.

1131
01:10:54,810 --> 01:10:56,680
- Let's get around.
- It's free.

1132
01:10:56,850 --> 01:10:59,340
Aggie got this
venison, Mr. President.

1133
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:01,570
He fired at a distance of 200 meters.

1134
01:11:01,750 --> 01:11:04,280
- Magnificent! She is a good shot.
- Thanks.

1135
01:11:04,450 --> 01:11:08,250
How are you.? If I had
time, I'd like to hunt something here.

1136
01:11:08,420 --> 01:11:11,390
We have a lot of deer and bears.

1137
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:14,590
Very tempting. But my tour
forces me to leave tonight.

1138
01:11:14,930 --> 01:11:18,300
- We were supposed to go fox hunting.
- Yes, they will have fun. Sure.

1139
01:11:18,470 --> 01:11:22,000
I returned some of the
most wonderful hunting equipment from London.

1140
01:11:22,170 --> 01:11:25,330
What a good idea! I could have
organized a good fox hunt,

1141
01:11:25,510 --> 01:11:29,380
it would have been a pleasure for the fox.
Far over hills and valleys!

1142
01:11:29,550 --> 01:11:32,510
Tallyho * and its rot.
Ashamed, you have to go.

1143
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:35,740
- I can't change the train schedule.
- Of course not.

1144
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:38,110
Pity.
We could talk about it for years.

1145
01:11:38,290 --> 01:11:41,220
- Yes, fox hunting.
- Bad show, I don't like it.

1146
01:11:41,390 --> 01:11:44,880
We are for hunting,
Brinstead. We will do a hunt.

1147
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:47,190
Bennett!
We stay until tomorrow.

1148
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:50,700
- Take care of the train.
- Long live President Roosevelt!

1149
01:11:50,870 --> 01:11:54,560
- And Brinstead is coming hunting.
- Long live the count!

1150
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:56,870
I could start tonight.

1151
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:59,530
Tallyho! * [Hunter's cry
as a fox escapes].

1152
01:12:02,140 --> 01:12:04,540
Come on kid.
Come on kid.

1153
01:12:05,650 --> 01:12:08,850
Quick boy! Go!
We can hunt the fox!

1154
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:11,080
Gallop, boy.

1155
01:12:13,420 --> 01:12:15,580
Okay, stop it, boy.

1156
01:12:16,330 --> 01:12:18,490
Not bad.

1157
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:21,720
Not bad on the barrel.

1158
01:12:24,370 --> 01:12:27,030
- Now with the horse.
- One alive?

1159
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:29,140
- An animal?
- Yes. Here's Bessie.

1160
01:12:29,310 --> 01:12:30,830
Carefully.

1161
01:12:31,010 --> 01:12:33,070
This is Bessie.

1162
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:36,910
Come on in, get used to it.
Gentle as a kitten.

1163
01:12:37,850 --> 01:12:41,210
Look at your teeth.
He is 15 years old.

1164
01:12:44,590 --> 01:12:48,080
I am not afraid of being bitten.
But when I mount it, yes.

1165
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:49,990
Let's go there.

1166
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:56,630
- You lied about your age!
- Okay, let's go back to the barrel.

1167
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:01,130
Aggie, let's face it. I cannot
ride a horse for the hunt.

1168
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:04,240
Playing the count is easy, and the
only thing I caught was work.

1169
01:13:04,410 --> 01:13:06,900
But you must ride.
The city depends on you.

1170
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:09,770
It can convince me.
Who convinces the horse?

1171
01:13:09,950 --> 01:13:13,310
I'll teach him to saddle up
even if we're here all night.

1172
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:15,780
No. I've tried,
but I'm just a parlor earl.

1173
01:13:15,950 --> 01:13:18,350
You will have to find someone else
for that task.

1174
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:23,080
I'm not asking you to ride
Big Squaw, Pa, or Ma.

1175
01:13:23,260 --> 01:13:24,890
Only for me.

1176
01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:27,360
Me? Am I something for you?

1177
01:13:28,660 --> 01:13:31,690
The first time I saw him, I said to myself:

1178
01:13:31,870 --> 01:13:36,270
"There you have a dirty,
short, cowardly coyote."

1179
01:13:36,870 --> 01:13:39,600
Then I got to know him better,

1180
01:13:40,010 --> 01:13:43,380
I categorized him as a filthy rat.

1181
01:13:43,910 --> 01:13:46,010
I have grown up with people like that.

1182
01:13:46,220 --> 01:13:50,910
But again, it reminds me of
a squirrel I had as a child.

1183
01:13:51,090 --> 01:13:53,490
I've only loved once.

1184
01:13:53,790 --> 01:13:56,220
Her gaze resembles his.

1185
01:13:56,390 --> 01:14:00,090
I'll never forget how he looked at me
before he left the west.

1186
01:14:00,260 --> 01:14:01,660
¿California?

1187
01:14:01,830 --> 01:14:04,990
Dead.
Cart Belknap shot him.

1188
01:14:07,870 --> 01:14:11,310
Did you tell Cart Belknap there
is nothing between us?

1189
01:14:11,470 --> 01:14:13,840
Not yet, but she was determined.

1190
01:14:14,010 --> 01:14:17,780
Do not do it. Because I
do n't want my wife to lie.

1191
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:23,980
Are you planning to leave us?

1192
01:14:24,150 --> 01:14:25,880
Let's go back to the barrel.

1193
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:28,820
Nothing will stop me from riding!

1194
01:14:30,590 --> 01:14:32,360
Can you help me please?

1195
01:14:32,530 --> 01:14:34,190
- Above.
- Yes, upstairs.

1196
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:35,920
Lower, please.

1197
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:38,360
A little more.
Chin up.

1198
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:42,800
You'll have to put up with me
before I hunt the fox.

1199
01:14:42,970 --> 01:14:43,935
Okay...

1200
01:14:43,970 --> 01:14:46,235
BIG SQUAW Welcomes

1201
01:14:46,270 --> 01:14:48,930
TEDDY ROOSVELT and the COUNT OF BRINSTEAD

1202
01:15:01,290 --> 01:15:03,780
Hold the fox while I put the sauce on.

1203
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:05,790
Sauce? So that?

1204
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:10,860
Dogs don't go for the fox,
but for the sauce.

1205
01:15:21,310 --> 01:15:23,610
Long live the President!

1206
01:15:24,310 --> 01:15:25,910
Hello.
Hello.

1207
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:30,110
Mr. President, how exciting!
Right?

1208
01:15:30,890 --> 01:15:33,350
If the truth.
Great idea, this hunt.

1209
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:38,050
It will not be like in England,
but the fox ignores the difference.

1210
01:15:38,730 --> 01:15:42,390
- This is your horse, Mr. President.
- Splendid. Splendid.

1211
01:15:42,670 --> 01:15:44,600
Tallyho! *
All set!

1212
01:15:44,770 --> 01:15:47,400
- Good morning, Excellency.
- Good morning, Brinstead.

1213
01:15:47,570 --> 01:15:51,340
- Splendid day to hunt.
- Typical Devon climate.

1214
01:15:51,510 --> 01:15:53,070
Give the man a horse to ride!

1215
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:54,500
Well, where is Bessie?

1216
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:56,980
- Here, Bess, here, Bess.
- Bessie is there.

1217
01:15:57,150 --> 01:16:00,980
- I didn't know you. You're...
- Wait a minute, Your Honor.

1218
01:16:01,850 --> 01:16:06,190
Mr. President, I brought this jackfruit
from my ranch, it's the best.

1219
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:08,820
Do me the honor of riding you on the hunt.

1220
01:16:08,990 --> 01:16:11,790
Excellent, sir, excellent.
You are very kind.

1221
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:16,230
I will be pleased.
Good animal, good animal.

1222
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:20,260
The count is a guest in our country.
He should ride it.

1223
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:23,890
I do not think so.
Hunting is like my old hat.

1224
01:16:24,070 --> 01:16:26,340
I don't want to deprive you of the
best mount.

1225
01:16:26,510 --> 01:16:29,000
I figured it out,
that's why I brought the best.

1226
01:16:29,180 --> 01:16:32,910
- I didn't have to do this.
- Great! Then I will accept.

1227
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:36,570
- Change the chair.
- Yes, great, I see.

1228
01:16:36,750 --> 01:16:39,480
- Now bring the earl's horse.
- Yes, bring...

1229
01:16:45,390 --> 01:16:47,860
- That horse?
- Why? It's Pacific!

1230
01:16:48,030 --> 01:16:51,560
- "Peaceful." Nickname, huh?
- He has only knocked down 4 riders.

1231
01:16:51,730 --> 01:16:54,570
Yes, but they weren't
master horsemen like the earl.

1232
01:16:54,740 --> 01:16:57,900
He will calm down when he knows
that you are the boss.

1233
01:16:58,070 --> 01:17:00,010
Can't we tell you sooner?

1234
01:17:02,780 --> 01:17:06,410
I don't want to be ungrateful,
but I promised Bessie

1235
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:08,240
and I don't want to let her down.

1236
01:17:08,420 --> 01:17:10,510
Do you want to cross Bessie
or the President?

1237
01:17:10,690 --> 01:17:13,710
- Don't answer.
- Put the chair on him!

1238
01:17:13,890 --> 01:17:16,980
- What are we going to do?
- You can break your leg.

1239
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:19,320
I know, I depend on you.

1240
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:24,060
Ready, Count.
Come on, I'll help you ride.

1241
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:27,030
Ride, he says.
If he knew.

1242
01:17:28,340 --> 01:17:30,900
Come on, old bean.

1243
01:17:38,050 --> 01:17:40,540
I'm terribly sorry.
Clumsy of me.

1244
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:42,510
Clumsy to ride.

1245
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:45,350
What happens?

1246
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:47,980
- What is it?
- An old injury.

1247
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:49,920
Playing rugby at Oxford.

1248
01:17:50,090 --> 01:17:52,390
They kept me on the team.
It was worth two.

1249
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:55,090
I know.
But there will be no hunting without you.

1250
01:17:55,260 --> 01:17:58,790
- I'll have to give the stop voice.
- Nothing of that. Tradition!

1251
01:17:58,970 --> 01:18:02,560
I'm not well.
Last night I didn't sleep thinking about it.

1252
01:18:02,740 --> 01:18:07,330
Don't unsaddle Pacific.
Bring him and kneel.

1253
01:18:10,610 --> 01:18:14,410
Brinstead, you must not ride.
It would aggravate that injury.

1254
01:18:14,580 --> 01:18:17,280
I will suffer for the President.
I'll be fine.

1255
01:18:17,450 --> 01:18:19,940
You cannot ride.
Orders of the President.

1256
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:23,750
I think I give up.
Bad luck.

1257
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:26,330
It's the first hunt I 've ever missed.

1258
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:29,260
I don't know how I'll explain it
to the Hunting Club.

1259
01:18:29,430 --> 01:18:33,370
Wow.
Well, you can criticize me now.

1260
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:35,440
Everyone up. Have fun.

1261
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:39,440
I'll sit here until the pain goes away.

1262
01:18:40,810 --> 01:18:43,470
Very bad "stringer" that of the count.

1263
01:18:43,650 --> 01:18:45,140
Yes.

1264
01:18:46,350 --> 01:18:49,580
And it will get much worse.
Give me the sauce.

1265
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:57,020
You must not keep the
President waiting. Come on, cheer up.

1266
01:18:57,190 --> 01:19:00,060
Voucher. Bring the fox.
I'll make you a stole.

1267
01:19:00,230 --> 01:19:02,890
- Poor knee.
- Too bad, count.

1268
01:19:03,070 --> 01:19:06,030
- I'm going to fix his leg.
- Perfect.

1269
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:08,830
- Any other injuries?
- Do not do that.

1270
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,630
- That's what was missing.
- How is your chest?

1271
01:19:11,810 --> 01:19:13,270
- I'm good.
- Any broken ribs?

1272
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:15,540
- No, I have them well.
- And his back?

1273
01:19:15,710 --> 01:19:17,200
My back.

1274
01:19:23,020 --> 01:19:24,780
- Do not worry.
- This will do you good.

1275
01:19:24,950 --> 01:19:27,220
Perfect. I will improve.

1276
01:19:28,820 --> 01:19:30,720
Trumpet of orders!

1277
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:34,890
Release the fox!

1278
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:48,370
Look how it runs!

1279
01:19:48,540 --> 01:19:50,480
He's going on a date with another bitch.

1280
01:19:51,810 --> 01:19:53,540
Unleash the hounds!

1281
01:20:03,390 --> 01:20:05,020
Hunting!

1282
01:20:17,410 --> 01:20:18,870
Hey, they are looking for you.

1283
01:20:25,010 --> 01:20:27,570
Help! Police, dogs!
Help! Go away!

1284
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:40,860
Am I the fox?

1285
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:03,480
Chivato.

1286
01:21:22,810 --> 01:21:24,770
There must be a shortage of meat!

1287
01:21:28,580 --> 01:21:30,600
Please help!
I wouldn't do this to a dog!

1288
01:21:30,780 --> 01:21:32,910
I'd throw a bone at them,
but this is my leg!

1289
01:22:50,980 --> 01:22:53,110
AMERICAN ACTOR

1290
01:22:53,180 --> 01:22:56,010
TENDLY
WILDLY RECEIVED

1291
01:23:58,930 --> 01:24:03,060
It is the first hunt where
the dogs get lost.

1292
01:24:03,230 --> 01:24:06,760
We should go home, pick up
weapons and go hunt a bear.

1293
01:24:06,940 --> 01:24:10,300
Don't even think about it. I barely have
time to go back

1294
01:24:10,470 --> 01:24:12,530
and say goodbye to my friend the count.

1295
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:16,840
Couldn't we just buy more dogs and move on?

1296
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:19,880
Ma, we already have a pack of barking dogs.

1297
01:24:20,050 --> 01:24:23,950
I don't know what happened to those
hungry hounds.

1298
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:25,590
Go.

1299
01:24:32,130 --> 01:24:35,190
CLOSED UNTIL AFTER
HUNTING.

1300
01:25:05,190 --> 01:25:06,750
One for the trip?

1301
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:10,930
For an injured leg, he rides very well.

1302
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:14,230
One who is born in a chair must hunt.

1303
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:15,730
- Do not tell me.
- Yes.

1304
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:19,100
Brinstead's coat of arms is
a pair of pants...

1305
01:25:19,270 --> 01:25:21,970
- rampant in a field of blisters.
- Very funny.

1306
01:25:22,140 --> 01:25:25,340
Now show me how you laugh
at this, Mr. Tyler.

1307
01:25:25,710 --> 01:25:28,510
- Tyler. Who is Tyler?
- You.

1308
01:25:28,680 --> 01:25:30,710
Here's your photo, Mr. Tyler.

1309
01:25:31,420 --> 01:25:34,690
I have read what they say about you.
Here it is:

1310
01:25:34,860 --> 01:25:38,690
"Arthur Tyler, American actor.
But not very good."

1311
01:25:38,860 --> 01:25:41,560
Yes? One moment.
There are others who say...

1312
01:25:41,730 --> 01:25:46,060
It's... read this. It says, "Arthur
Tyler outstanding performance."

1313
01:25:46,230 --> 01:25:48,830
- You don't admit it's Arthur Tyler?
- Of course not.

1314
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,630
So what was the album doing
under his pillow?

1315
01:25:51,810 --> 01:25:53,540
I like to sleep with my head on hard.

1316
01:25:53,710 --> 01:25:57,650
I am Humphrey, Earl of Brinstead,
old friend. Pip-pip and all that.

1317
01:25:57,810 --> 01:26:00,110
And I want my album.

1318
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:03,480
The President and the city will
know the truth

1319
01:26:03,650 --> 01:26:07,140
and how you have made fun
of the Floud and everyone.

1320
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:11,350
But Mr. Belknap.
Will not Ud. to contárselo.

1321
01:26:11,530 --> 01:26:14,790
It's not about me, it's about the Floud.
They are very nice people.

1322
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:17,490
- Especially Aggie.
- Yes it's true.

1323
01:26:17,670 --> 01:26:20,600
I won't shut it up for a million dollars.

1324
01:26:26,680 --> 01:26:29,270
Okay, I'm going, Mr. Tyler.
Goodbye.

1325
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:34,040
By the way, I will speak well of you
in your obituary.

1326
01:26:35,050 --> 01:26:38,380
Can not do that.
You won't take my album!

1327
01:26:38,550 --> 01:26:39,820
Oh no?

1328
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:54,380
He found my album.
You know I'm an actor.

1329
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:56,180
Okay, get out of here, quick!

1330
01:29:15,740 --> 01:29:17,580
I'd swear it was Brinstead.

1331
01:29:17,750 --> 01:29:19,870
- Brinstead? Where?
- There.

1332
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:09,800
Fast! The President is coming.
Go away!

1333
01:30:12,330 --> 01:30:14,460
- Brinstead!
- Mr. Roosevelt!

1334
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:17,160
I almost missed it.
I had to say goodbye, Mr.

1335
01:30:17,340 --> 01:30:19,640
- What happened?
- I wanted to catch the train earlier

1336
01:30:19,810 --> 01:30:23,440
of you leaving, but I
fell twice. Bad leg, Mr.

1337
01:30:23,610 --> 01:30:26,410
He didn't have to.
It should be in bed.

1338
01:30:26,580 --> 01:30:30,350
Do not worry. It was great
that you were at Big Squaw.

1339
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:32,280
Splendid hunt.
I wish you to come back here.

1340
01:30:32,450 --> 01:30:35,120
Maybe we can hunt together
when you cross the pond.

1341
01:30:38,990 --> 01:30:42,190
This was what happened to our dogs.

1342
01:30:45,130 --> 01:30:47,570
Crazy dogs.
Why are they persecuting you?

1343
01:30:47,740 --> 01:30:50,830
Mr. President, you and the entire city
should know that the Floud

1344
01:30:51,010 --> 01:30:53,410
and the false count, they
have tried to deceive him.

1345
01:30:53,580 --> 01:30:57,200
- What are you talking about, Belknap?
- He's a cheap actor.

1346
01:30:57,450 --> 01:31:01,250
It is the most humiliating thing.
Because I'm going back to England...

1347
01:31:01,420 --> 01:31:03,750
He's a phony, and that album will prove it.

1348
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:07,910
Because... Give me that!
Accusations, just accusations!

1349
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,930
If we make it out alive, nothing will
come between us.

1350
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:42,750
A kiss like that can kill one.

1351
