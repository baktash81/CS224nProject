1
00:00:42,617 --> 00:00:46,644
Hey, it's Monday morning,
and I'm Jack Lucas.

2
00:00:46,721 --> 00:00:50,122
Hi. This is about my husband.

3
00:00:50,191 --> 00:00:51,681
Yes.

4
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:54,125
He drives me crazy.

5
00:00:54,195 --> 00:00:56,163
I'll be talking...

6
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:59,358
and he'll never let me
finish a sentence.

7
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:02,426
- He's always finishing--
- He's always finishing your thoughts.

8
00:01:02,503 --> 00:01:03,993
That's awful.

9
00:01:04,072 --> 00:01:06,438
It absolutely drives me--

10
00:01:06,507 --> 00:01:09,499
It drives you crazy, doesn't it?
He's a scoundrel.

11
00:01:10,645 --> 00:01:13,375
Jack, you've hit the nail--

12
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,678
Hit the nail on the head.

13
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,684
Somebody ought to hit you on the head.

14
00:01:29,097 --> 00:01:34,034
So tell us. How long have you
and Senator Payton been having...

15
00:01:36,571 --> 00:01:38,505
this sleazy affair?

16
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:43,607
This is great.
This is disgusting.

17
00:01:43,678 --> 00:01:45,646
I am tired
of the public thinking...

18
00:01:45,713 --> 00:01:48,841
that they have a right to invade
a person's private life.

19
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:52,215
Come on. You had sex with a senator
in the parking lot of Sea World.

20
00:01:52,286 --> 00:01:54,618
You're telling me you're
a private kind of person? No.

21
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:58,455
- You're our--
- Spotlight Celebrity!

22
00:01:58,526 --> 00:02:02,018
We want to hear about
the backrests of limos.

23
00:02:02,096 --> 00:02:05,224
About the ruined lives of people
we want to be.

24
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:07,859
New and exotic uses
for champagne corks.

25
00:02:07,935 --> 00:02:11,371
I have been humiliated enough already,
okay?

26
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:14,499
Perhaps not.
We need those details.

27
00:02:14,575 --> 00:02:16,634
You're a pig, Jack.

28
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,713
You're on the air, caller.

29
00:02:24,786 --> 00:02:26,720
Hello, Jack. It's Edwin.

30
00:02:26,788 --> 00:02:29,188
Oh, it's Edwin!

31
00:02:30,758 --> 00:02:33,659
We haven't heard from you in what?
A day? I've missed you.

32
00:02:33,728 --> 00:02:35,320
I've missed you, too.

33
00:02:35,396 --> 00:02:37,796
It's sunrise confession time.
What have you got for us?

34
00:02:37,865 --> 00:02:39,799
I went to this bar...

35
00:02:39,867 --> 00:02:44,201
this very hard-to-get-into place
called Babbitt's.

36
00:02:44,272 --> 00:02:48,402
I know the place. It's a chic
yuppie watering hole.

37
00:02:48,476 --> 00:02:50,944
I met this beautiful woman.

38
00:02:51,012 --> 00:02:54,448
Come on. If you start telling me
you're falling in love again...

39
00:02:54,515 --> 00:02:56,847
I'll have to remind you of the time
we made you propose...

40
00:02:56,918 --> 00:03:00,354
to that check-out girl at Thritty's
that you liked so much.

41
00:03:00,421 --> 00:03:02,889
Do you remember her reaction?

42
00:03:02,957 --> 00:03:06,586
She was just a girl.
This is a beautiful woman.

43
00:03:06,661 --> 00:03:08,720
And "Pinocchio" is a true story.

44
00:03:08,796 --> 00:03:11,788
You'll never get this tart
to your dessert plate.

45
00:03:11,866 --> 00:03:14,232
This is different.
She likes--

46
00:03:14,302 --> 00:03:18,363
Edwin ! Come on, now.
I told you about these people.

47
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:21,306
They only mate with their own kind.
It's called yuppie inbreeding.

48
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:25,243
That's why so many are retarded and wear
the same clothes. They're not human.

49
00:03:25,313 --> 00:03:28,578
They don't feel love.
They only negotiate love moments.

50
00:03:28,649 --> 00:03:30,082
They're evil.

51
00:03:30,151 --> 00:03:32,745
They're repulsed by imperfection,
horrified by the banal.

52
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:36,415
Everything that America stands for,
everything that you and I tight for.

53
00:03:36,491 --> 00:03:39,085
They must be stopped
before it's too late.

54
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,094
It's us or them.

55
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,031
Okay, Jack.

56
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,532
All right.

57
00:03:47,468 --> 00:03:50,494
Well, it's been a thrill, as always.

58
00:03:50,571 --> 00:03:53,972
Have a perfect day. Everyone here
at the "Jack Lucas Show"...

59
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,838
says "Bye."

60
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:58,504
This is Jack Lucas.
So long. Arrivederci.

61
00:03:58,579 --> 00:04:00,513
I'll be sending you a thought today...

62
00:04:00,581 --> 00:04:02,776
as I lie in the back
of my stretch limo...

63
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,751
having sex with the teenager
of my choice.

64
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,913
And that thought will be...

65
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:11,356
"Thank God I'm me."

66
00:04:21,502 --> 00:04:23,993
Some of this is very funny.

67
00:04:24,071 --> 00:04:27,529
They even secured the rights to the
Donna Summer song to play over credits.

68
00:04:27,608 --> 00:04:29,542
Ooh, I have chills.

69
00:04:30,545 --> 00:04:33,241
You sure they want me? I won't read it
unless I have an offer.

70
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,248
Of course. Not even a question.

71
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:39,446
When I talked to them on the phone,
I could smell how much they want you.

72
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,318
I could smell it over the phone.

73
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,823
Bums.

74
00:04:46,961 --> 00:04:48,895
I don't have any change.
You have any?

75
00:04:48,963 --> 00:04:50,931
I'm not opening this window.

76
00:04:51,866 --> 00:04:54,835
A couple quarters isn't gonna make
any difference anyway.

77
00:05:03,811 --> 00:05:05,972
I hate my cheeks.

78
00:05:09,784 --> 00:05:12,844
Raoul called before about dinner.

79
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,182
Oh, God.

80
00:05:14,255 --> 00:05:17,691
About dinner as a concept,
or about dinner with Raoul?

81
00:05:17,758 --> 00:05:19,521
You're so witty.

82
00:05:19,594 --> 00:05:22,154
I've got to get out of here
and do something.

83
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:25,631
Tomorrow is a very big day for me.

84
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,930
It would be nice it you pretended
like you understood.

85
00:05:28,002 --> 00:05:30,027
Fine. I'll say no.

86
00:05:30,104 --> 00:05:33,870
- They're putting me on film tomorrow.
- Fine.

87
00:05:33,941 --> 00:05:38,139
First time in my life
I'll be a voice with a body.

88
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:43,313
You know what that means?
What this could lead to?

89
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:46,319
It's a sitcom, Jack.
You're not defining pi.

90
00:05:48,022 --> 00:05:53,085
I'll remember that when you get excited
drawing pubic hair on Raisin Bran.

91
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,685
Do you want some?

92
00:05:55,763 --> 00:05:57,424
No. I have to work.

93
00:05:57,498 --> 00:05:59,432
How un-'60s of you.

94
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,593
I was nine in the '60s.

95
00:06:04,972 --> 00:06:07,372
I used to think...

96
00:06:07,441 --> 00:06:10,239
my biography
ought to be entitled...

97
00:06:10,311 --> 00:06:14,907
"Jack Lucas:
The Face Behind the Voice."

98
00:06:16,017 --> 00:06:19,953
But now it can be,
"Jack Lucas: The Face and the Voice."

99
00:06:20,955 --> 00:06:23,321
Or maybe just "Jack!"

100
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:26,522
Exclamation point.

101
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:30,792
"Honey, where's my orange cup
with the teddy bear?

102
00:06:30,865 --> 00:06:32,856
I'll kill that old bitch.

103
00:06:34,502 --> 00:06:37,437
I have a fever.
I really think I'm dying.

104
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,401
Well, forgive me."

105
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,381
Forgive me.

106
00:07:30,591 --> 00:07:32,525
I have this.

107
00:07:34,795 --> 00:07:37,423
I really have this.

108
00:07:46,107 --> 00:07:49,941
They're evil. They're repulsed by
imperfection, horrified by the banal.

109
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:54,414
Everything that America stands for,
everything that you and I fight for.

110
00:07:54,482 --> 00:07:58,475
They must be stopped before
it's too late. It's us or them.

111
00:07:58,552 --> 00:08:03,182
It was Mr. Lucas's offhand remark
that had fatal impact on Mr. Malnick.

112
00:08:03,257 --> 00:08:04,952
Marc Saffron is on the scene.

113
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,584
An after-work hot spot...

114
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,128
Babbitt's is popular
with single, young professionals.

115
00:08:09,196 --> 00:08:12,654
Edwin Malnick arrived
at the peak hour of 7:15...

116
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:16,760
took one long look at the collection
of the city's best and brightest...

117
00:08:16,837 --> 00:08:20,796
then removed a shotgun
from his overcoat and opened fire.

118
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:24,834
Seven people were killed before
Mr. Malnick turned the gun on himself...

119
00:08:24,912 --> 00:08:27,244
and shot a hole through his head.

120
00:08:27,314 --> 00:08:30,875
Representatives of radio personality
Jack Lucas expressed regret...

121
00:08:30,951 --> 00:08:33,283
however no formal comment
has been made.

122
00:08:33,354 --> 00:08:36,517
Neighbors of Malnick said he was
a quiet man who lived alone.

123
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:40,253
"You scarcely knew he was there," said
a woman who lived near Malnick 11 years.

124
00:08:40,327 --> 00:08:44,024
But today, few will soon forget
this lonely man...

125
00:08:44,098 --> 00:08:46,828
who reached out to a world
he knew only through the radio...

126
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:50,928
looking for friendship,
and finding only pain and tragedy.

127
00:08:51,005 --> 00:08:53,906
Marc Saffron, Channel Seven News.

128
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:01,847
Fuck.

129
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:19,798
Garbage. People are garbage.

130
00:09:19,867 --> 00:09:21,300
Pigs!

131
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:27,301
Go ahead and panic.

132
00:09:27,374 --> 00:09:29,535
Mr. Happiness.

133
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,044
You gonna do a little work today
or what?

134
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,715
What, out there?

135
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,584
They're not terrorists.

136
00:09:38,652 --> 00:09:41,485
They're just ordinary people
like you and me.

137
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:49,119
Breakfast of champions, right?

138
00:09:51,031 --> 00:09:52,293
That one.

139
00:09:52,366 --> 00:09:56,234
That will be for me,
and then this scary one.

140
00:09:56,303 --> 00:09:58,965
Yes. A scary one and a funny one.

141
00:10:04,778 --> 00:10:06,245
Can you help me?

142
00:10:06,313 --> 00:10:09,805
I've been looking over an hour,
and I'm losing my mind.

143
00:10:09,884 --> 00:10:14,548
What I'm in the mood for is
a Katherine-Hepburny, Cary-Granty thing.

144
00:10:14,622 --> 00:10:19,559
Nothing heavy. I couldn't take heavy.
I'm looking for something zany.

145
00:10:19,627 --> 00:10:24,326
Or something modern would be fine,
like a Goldie-Hawny, Chevy-Chasey thing.

146
00:10:24,398 --> 00:10:27,959
You know, funny.
I have to laugh tonight.

147
00:10:28,035 --> 00:10:32,096
Do you have anything with
that comedian? He's on that show.

148
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:37,042
It's "On the Radio." You know,
the guy who says, "Hey, forgive me."

149
00:10:37,111 --> 00:10:39,409
I get such a kick out of the way
he says that.

150
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,381
He's so adorable.
That would be perfect.

151
00:10:42,449 --> 00:10:45,009
Didn't he make a movie?

152
00:10:45,085 --> 00:10:47,485
"Ordinary Peepholes."

153
00:10:51,292 --> 00:10:54,693
It's kind of a big-titty,
spread-cheeky kind of thing.

154
00:10:54,762 --> 00:10:58,892
Excuse me. I just want
to borrow him for a minute.

155
00:11:03,804 --> 00:11:05,999
You're gonna love that.

156
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:13,278
- That was a frightening woman.
- Are you in one of your moods today?

157
00:11:13,347 --> 00:11:16,145
If she didn't get something zany quick,
she was going to pull the pin.

158
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:20,119
Is this one of the days
when you're in your emotional abyss?

159
00:11:20,187 --> 00:11:24,248
I don't understand these moods
that you get into.

160
00:11:24,325 --> 00:11:25,758
They're my moods.

161
00:11:25,826 --> 00:11:29,057
You want to understand moods, have one
of your own. I hate desperate people.

162
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:33,225
Sweetie, baby, love of my life,
you hate people.

163
00:11:34,602 --> 00:11:36,695
Why don't you take the day off?

164
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:39,204
Go upstairs, put your feet up.

165
00:11:39,273 --> 00:11:41,639
I'll cook tonight. Okay?

166
00:11:43,611 --> 00:11:45,340
All right.

167
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,579
Have you seen my orange cup
with the teddy bear?

168
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:51,174
Grandma used it
for her urine specimen.

169
00:12:03,897 --> 00:12:07,731
- It's funny. What do you want from me?
- It's not funny.

170
00:12:07,801 --> 00:12:12,932
-Why do we watch it all the time?
-I feel good to see how not funny it is.

171
00:12:13,007 --> 00:12:17,171
How America doesn't know funny, which
makes it easier not being famous...

172
00:12:17,244 --> 00:12:20,145
because that would mean
I'm not really talented.

173
00:12:21,415 --> 00:12:24,077
You are a sick fuck.
You know that?

174
00:12:26,186 --> 00:12:28,848
I don't know why you torture yourself.

175
00:12:28,922 --> 00:12:31,755
- Don't do that. I don't like that.
- I'm trying to watch.

176
00:12:31,825 --> 00:12:34,487
You have too many thoughts
roaming around.

177
00:12:34,561 --> 00:12:38,327
You're very self-absorbed.
Divert yourself.

178
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,128
Read a book.

179
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,260
It's important to think, Anne.
It's what separates us from lentils...

180
00:12:43,337 --> 00:12:46,272
and people that read books
like "Love Song."

181
00:12:49,043 --> 00:12:50,977
Great book, dumb title.

182
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:56,511
You know, you used to say
you liked that about me.

183
00:12:56,583 --> 00:13:00,144
You used to say you liked that we
didn't have to think all the time...

184
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,883
that we could just be together
and not think.

185
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,226
Well...

186
00:13:07,294 --> 00:13:11,060
suicidal paranoiacs
will say anything to get laid.

187
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:24,705
Have another drink, Jack.
It's on the house, like everything else.

188
00:13:26,146 --> 00:13:29,775
I hope when you're my age, your children
treat you with the same disrespect.

189
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,943
I've got a fever. I'm dying.

190
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:34,112
You're not dying.
You just have a cold.

191
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:37,885
You can't die before Sunday because
we're going to the Billy Joel concert.

192
00:13:39,593 --> 00:13:43,290
Well, forgive me!

193
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,799
Madness!

194
00:13:57,745 --> 00:13:59,178
Shit!

195
00:14:07,354 --> 00:14:09,982
Forgive me!

196
00:14:14,161 --> 00:14:15,594
Fuck.

197
00:14:21,168 --> 00:14:23,102
Watch it, asshole.

198
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:25,638
Forgive me, tuck-head!

199
00:14:36,517 --> 00:14:39,315
Hey, over here!

200
00:14:39,386 --> 00:14:41,320
Here I am.

201
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,121
Taxi !

202
00:14:44,191 --> 00:14:46,659
Hello! Merry Christmas!

203
00:14:49,863 --> 00:14:53,196
Hey, buddy, help a guy out.

204
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:56,168
Help me out with a quarter.
Come on. Sport.

205
00:15:00,808 --> 00:15:04,300
Get away from me.
You're a maniac.

206
00:15:04,378 --> 00:15:06,107
You're crazy.

207
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,704
Mr. Bum?

208
00:15:10,617 --> 00:15:12,346
Here.

209
00:15:26,834 --> 00:15:30,099
Anybody here named Jiminy?

210
00:15:36,243 --> 00:15:38,939
You ever read Nietzsche?

211
00:15:39,012 --> 00:15:42,914
Nietzsche says there are
two kinds of people in the world.

212
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:45,417
People who are destined
for greatness...

213
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:49,718
like Walt Disney and Hitler...

214
00:15:50,757 --> 00:15:53,248
and then there's the rest of us.

215
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,261
He called us...

216
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,297
"the bungled and the botched."

217
00:15:58,532 --> 00:16:00,898
We get teased.

218
00:16:00,968 --> 00:16:04,062
We sometimes get close to greatness...

219
00:16:04,137 --> 00:16:06,071
but we never get there.

220
00:16:08,609 --> 00:16:11,043
We're the expendable masses.

221
00:16:14,748 --> 00:16:17,842
We get pushed in front of trains,
take poison aspirin...

222
00:16:18,785 --> 00:16:22,186
get gunned down in Dairy Queens.

223
00:16:25,492 --> 00:16:28,984
You want to hear the new title
of my biography...

224
00:16:29,062 --> 00:16:31,394
my little Italian friend?

225
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:38,869
"It Was No Fuckin' Picnic:
The Jack Lucas Story."

226
00:16:38,939 --> 00:16:40,907
You like it?

227
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:45,235
Il Nova Esta
Fuckin' Picnic-O.

228
00:16:48,749 --> 00:16:50,808
You're a good kid.

229
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,909
You just say "No" to drugs.

230
00:17:05,732 --> 00:17:07,859
You ever get the feeling sometimes...

231
00:17:09,303 --> 00:17:11,567
you're being punished for your sins?

232
00:17:58,885 --> 00:18:00,682
What's goin' on?

233
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,926
I said, what's goin' on?

234
00:18:10,197 --> 00:18:12,165
What are you doin' here, man?

235
00:18:14,067 --> 00:18:16,001
You shouldn't hang around
this neighborhood.

236
00:18:16,069 --> 00:18:18,697
I was just leaving.

237
00:18:18,772 --> 00:18:21,138
People spend hard-earned money
for this neighborhood.

238
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:25,804
It's not fair looking out their window
and see your ass asleep on the streets!

239
00:18:25,879 --> 00:18:27,312
Yes, I agree.

240
00:18:27,381 --> 00:18:29,372
That's very good.

241
00:18:29,449 --> 00:18:31,383
You believe this drunk?

242
00:18:31,451 --> 00:18:33,783
Me neither, man. Do it!

243
00:18:40,293 --> 00:18:41,726
Hold, varlet...

244
00:18:41,795 --> 00:18:44,730
or feel the sting of my shaft!

245
00:18:48,268 --> 00:18:52,602
In the name of Blanche De Fleur,
unhand that errant knight!

246
00:18:53,373 --> 00:18:56,865
Do you speak English?
Let the bum go, dipshit.

247
00:18:59,946 --> 00:19:03,382
Mendacity!
Why are two city squires like you...

248
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:05,384
abusing a knight like this?

249
00:19:05,452 --> 00:19:07,113
You a faggot?

250
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:10,350
Faggot? No, but I do believe
in fairies.

251
00:19:10,424 --> 00:19:13,222
- Not without dinner.
- You fucking nuts?

252
00:19:13,293 --> 00:19:16,353
Viola! Let's show him what he's won.

253
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:19,058
I advise you to let us go.

254
00:19:19,132 --> 00:19:23,762
- You advise us?
- Yes. You're outnumbered, son. See?

255
00:19:31,945 --> 00:19:34,413
Looks like "Night of the Living Dead."

256
00:19:34,481 --> 00:19:37,109
Come on! Go for it!

257
00:19:37,184 --> 00:19:39,448
- They can't do nothin'.
- "Can't do nothin'."

258
00:19:41,488 --> 00:19:43,183
Nothing?

259
00:19:43,256 --> 00:19:45,554
Gentlemen.

260
00:19:46,993 --> 00:19:51,225
I like New York in June

261
00:19:51,298 --> 00:19:53,732
How about you

262
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:57,759
I like a Gershwin tune

263
00:19:57,838 --> 00:20:00,466
How about you

264
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,667
Look, it's show time.

265
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,176
You know, boys...

266
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:07,008
there's three things in this world
that you need:

267
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,605
Respect for all kinds of life...

268
00:20:09,683 --> 00:20:11,617
a nice bowel movement
on a regular basis...

269
00:20:11,685 --> 00:20:13,812
and a navy blazer.

270
00:20:13,887 --> 00:20:17,584
One more thing.
Never take your eye off the ball!

271
00:20:20,026 --> 00:20:23,518
Of course, the ability to bean
a shithead can be a fabulous advantage.

272
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,834
Please, don't hurt me.

273
00:20:38,044 --> 00:20:41,411
Why? So you can be healthy
when you jump? No.

274
00:20:41,481 --> 00:20:44,211
You can't leave me tied up here alone,
you fucking faggot!

275
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:47,344
Oh, you're not gonna be alone.

276
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:52,552
Come and get it!

277
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,893
I need a drink.

278
00:20:55,829 --> 00:20:58,457
I know a fabulous place
with great ambiance.

279
00:21:09,576 --> 00:21:12,067
What do you think of the death penalty?

280
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:14,079
Death's definitely a penalty.

281
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:17,708
It ain't no fuckin' gift.
Life's too goddamn short.

282
00:21:17,784 --> 00:21:19,217
Great place, huh?

283
00:21:26,293 --> 00:21:29,228
- How are you tonight?
- Not bad, John. And you?

284
00:21:29,296 --> 00:21:32,197
- Can't complain.
- Can I interest anybody in a fruit pie?

285
00:21:32,265 --> 00:21:34,825
No, thank you. Too fattening.

286
00:21:59,492 --> 00:22:02,791
- Have a drink.
- I better be leaving.

287
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,797
Drink, goddamn it!

288
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:12,562
I think they like you.

289
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,806
I like New York in June

290
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,969
How about you

291
00:22:18,044 --> 00:22:20,035
You were great tonight, Parry.

292
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:24,877
I like potato chips
and moonlight and roses

293
00:22:24,951 --> 00:22:27,112
How about you

294
00:22:32,158 --> 00:22:33,591
Welcome back.

295
00:22:35,161 --> 00:22:36,753
How you feeling?

296
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,821
Have I died?

297
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,836
Easy. You want to get up?
There you go.

298
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:47,271
Gravity works.
Take it real slow. There you go.

299
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:50,104
- Take a few breaths.
- Where am l?

300
00:22:50,977 --> 00:22:52,410
It's my domicile.

301
00:22:52,479 --> 00:22:54,845
It's my humble abode.

302
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:57,406
Mi casa is su casa.

303
00:22:57,484 --> 00:23:01,978
Want something to eat? Your stomach must
be a real tabula rasa after last night.

304
00:23:02,055 --> 00:23:05,991
These are raisins or rat shit.
You can't tell sometimes.

305
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:09,085
Oh ! How about a fruit pie?

306
00:23:11,498 --> 00:23:13,659
You're right.
I was off a couple months.

307
00:23:16,102 --> 00:23:18,764
It's nice to have company.
Hi.

308
00:23:18,838 --> 00:23:21,170
- Where are my shoes?
- What?

309
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:25,637
Excuse me.

310
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:28,846
What is it? I've got company.

311
00:23:28,915 --> 00:23:30,746
What?

312
00:23:30,817 --> 00:23:33,377
I knew it. I knew it last night.

313
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:35,216
I did too.

314
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:38,223
Don't look at me.
He's the one.

315
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:42,050
- Can you keep a secret?
- No.

316
00:23:42,128 --> 00:23:45,188
Good. Because you know what
the little people told me?

317
00:23:45,265 --> 00:23:47,256
The little people?

318
00:23:47,334 --> 00:23:48,767
You know.

319
00:23:49,569 --> 00:23:52,663
They said you're the one.

320
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,073
The one what?

321
00:23:56,209 --> 00:23:58,006
Shut up!

322
00:23:58,078 --> 00:24:01,070
Get away from him!
This will get them.

323
00:24:01,147 --> 00:24:04,139
Wintergreen.
I'm sorry about this.

324
00:24:04,217 --> 00:24:06,515
There we are.

325
00:24:06,586 --> 00:24:09,885
They said you're not ready
to know yet.

326
00:24:09,956 --> 00:24:11,890
I'm not.

327
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:14,756
He is too!
Get out of here!

328
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:17,422
Beat it! I have Raid!

329
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:19,897
Oh, yeah, fly up there.

330
00:24:21,368 --> 00:24:23,700
Move out. Out of here.

331
00:24:27,374 --> 00:24:29,842
You can't be in there.

332
00:24:31,177 --> 00:24:33,941
You're frightening him.

333
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:37,541
- You know who I am?
- I'm drawing a blank.

334
00:24:37,617 --> 00:24:40,245
Take a guess.
Let him guess.

335
00:24:43,323 --> 00:24:47,851
I don't know. You seem to be
some kind of vigilante?

336
00:24:47,927 --> 00:24:50,862
That happens along the way, of course,
but here's a clue.

337
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,559
A hood ornament.

338
00:24:56,636 --> 00:24:59,935
No. I'm a knight...

339
00:25:00,006 --> 00:25:02,566
on a special quest.

340
00:25:02,642 --> 00:25:04,473
And I need help.

341
00:25:07,781 --> 00:25:09,214
Quest.

342
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,246
That's why they sent you.

343
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:16,447
- The little--
- Yes. Yes.

344
00:25:16,523 --> 00:25:20,084
You see, they work for Him.

345
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,355
So do l.

346
00:25:22,429 --> 00:25:24,192
Him?

347
00:25:24,264 --> 00:25:26,061
God.

348
00:25:26,132 --> 00:25:28,123
I'm the janitor of God.

349
00:25:29,169 --> 00:25:30,431
I know.

350
00:25:31,838 --> 00:25:35,296
Yeah. I know how you feel.

351
00:25:35,375 --> 00:25:38,037
They came to me about a year ago.

352
00:25:38,111 --> 00:25:42,343
I was sitting on the john having one
of those satisfying bowel movements.

353
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:45,350
Those ones that border on mystical?
Where you're like--

354
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:01,366
And there they were.

355
00:26:02,669 --> 00:26:06,469
Hundreds of the cutest
little tat people...

356
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:08,769
floating right in front of me.

357
00:26:09,709 --> 00:26:12,439
It was wonderful.
And then...

358
00:26:12,512 --> 00:26:13,945
they spoke.

359
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:19,313
They said I had been chosen
to get back something very special...

360
00:26:19,385 --> 00:26:22,513
that He had lost,
and my part would be dangerous.

361
00:26:22,589 --> 00:26:25,649
I said, "Whoa! Hold it right there."

362
00:26:25,725 --> 00:26:30,355
You start seeing little fat people that
tell you you're on a mission from God...

363
00:26:31,431 --> 00:26:33,558
they'll slap you
some heavy Thorazine.

364
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:36,261
I said, "Give me a sign."

365
00:26:36,336 --> 00:26:39,203
They said, "Look in
'Progressive Architecture'...

366
00:26:39,272 --> 00:26:41,240
February '88, page 33."

367
00:26:43,243 --> 00:26:45,677
That's pretty specific, huh?

368
00:26:45,745 --> 00:26:47,975
Bingo! He knows.

369
00:26:48,047 --> 00:26:51,483
He knows. It's right here.

370
00:26:51,551 --> 00:26:54,918
Where is it?
A, B, F, M!

371
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:57,081
It's under miscellaneous,
not mythology.

372
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:59,557
Look at this. Here it is.

373
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:06,421
Right there. See it?

374
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,268
Langdon Carmichael.

375
00:27:09,335 --> 00:27:12,202
Right there. See it?

376
00:27:12,272 --> 00:27:13,705
What?

377
00:27:16,242 --> 00:27:17,675
The grail.

378
00:27:20,113 --> 00:27:22,172
The Holy Grail.

379
00:27:24,117 --> 00:27:26,950
It's God's symbol of divine grace.

380
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,988
The Holy--

381
00:27:29,055 --> 00:27:33,754
Some billionaire has the Holy Grail
in his library on Fifth Avenue.

382
00:27:33,826 --> 00:27:36,886
Who'd think you'd find anything divine
on the Upper East Side?

383
00:27:36,963 --> 00:27:39,431
I don't mean to be flippant
or enrage you...

384
00:27:39,499 --> 00:27:41,729
but you're a psychotic man.

385
00:27:41,801 --> 00:27:44,861
A very nice psychotic man.

386
00:27:44,938 --> 00:27:46,872
I appreciate what you did.

387
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,636
I think it was a brave and noble thing.

388
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:51,199
You're embarrassing me.

389
00:27:51,277 --> 00:27:55,145
I'm sure I'll see of lot of you
on talk shows when you get the grail.

390
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,445
Please, don't go!

391
00:27:57,517 --> 00:27:58,950
I can't.

392
00:27:59,819 --> 00:28:01,753
I can't get it...

393
00:28:02,822 --> 00:28:05,256
'cause he's out there.

394
00:28:05,325 --> 00:28:07,259
He's always out there.

395
00:28:09,796 --> 00:28:13,527
That's why you can get it.
That's why you're the one.

396
00:28:14,601 --> 00:28:17,195
I'm not the one.

397
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:19,465
I'm not anyone.

398
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,843
Forget about the shoes.

399
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:28,813
- I'm gonna take a cab--
- Parry.

400
00:28:28,881 --> 00:28:31,372
- I'm Jack.
- I know.

401
00:28:37,023 --> 00:28:38,547
Wait. Don't--

402
00:28:39,826 --> 00:28:41,623
They're-- Here they are!

403
00:28:45,698 --> 00:28:47,791
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

404
00:28:49,902 --> 00:28:52,166
You can keep the doll.

405
00:28:55,208 --> 00:28:56,800
Thanks a mil, huh?

406
00:28:56,876 --> 00:28:59,936
Now that you know where we are,
don't be a stranger.

407
00:29:00,013 --> 00:29:02,004
Come back. We'll rummage.

408
00:29:03,349 --> 00:29:06,716
Take care of yourself, Jack.
Give my love to the wife.

409
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:08,720
I'm not married.

410
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:11,348
Really? You look married.

411
00:29:14,394 --> 00:29:16,328
Don't be a stranger.

412
00:29:17,897 --> 00:29:19,330
See ya.

413
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:33,578
Hey, where you coming from?

414
00:29:35,848 --> 00:29:37,782
The basement, I think.

415
00:29:38,951 --> 00:29:42,512
I tell him no visitors!
Hold it.

416
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:46,081
You a friend of Parry's?

417
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,094
I don't allow no entertaining.

418
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:52,529
I let him stay here out of the goodness
of my heart because of the tragedy...

419
00:29:52,598 --> 00:29:56,967
but I'm not running a hotel,
and nobody's taking advantage of me.

420
00:29:57,036 --> 00:29:58,298
Tragedy?

421
00:29:58,371 --> 00:30:00,771
He and his wife were in some bar...

422
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:05,038
and some nut comes in with a shotgun
and blew the place apart.

423
00:30:05,111 --> 00:30:08,478
Splattered her brains
all over the walls.

424
00:30:08,548 --> 00:30:12,814
She was a beautiful girl.
Never knew what hit her.

425
00:30:12,885 --> 00:30:16,343
You heard about that,
that nut who listened to the radio?

426
00:30:18,057 --> 00:30:20,525
You could've been attacked,
raped, God knows what!

427
00:30:20,593 --> 00:30:22,959
I was up all night, Jack!

428
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:24,462
Sorry.

429
00:30:25,898 --> 00:30:28,833
- A guy wants to check out pornos.
- So send him back.

430
00:30:30,002 --> 00:30:33,267
- What the hell happened?
- I was attacked.

431
00:30:33,339 --> 00:30:34,772
What?

432
00:30:35,441 --> 00:30:37,773
Oh, baby!

433
00:30:37,844 --> 00:30:40,608
Two kids tried to set me on tire.

434
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,672
What did they do to you?

435
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:47,413
You almost done? Are you looking
for a story, what?

436
00:30:47,487 --> 00:30:50,945
- I've seen most of them.
- "Creamer Versus Creamer." Won an award

437
00:30:51,023 --> 00:30:52,456
Go.

438
00:30:55,561 --> 00:30:58,086
Did you call the police?
Do you want me to call the doctor?

439
00:30:58,164 --> 00:30:59,597
No, I'm fine.

440
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,234
Are you sure?

441
00:31:06,005 --> 00:31:08,735
So where did you sleep last night?

442
00:31:08,808 --> 00:31:11,140
I stayed at a friend's, Anne.

443
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:17,679
Okay, Jack, I want you
to be up front with me.

444
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,344
It you're seeing somebody else,
just tell me.

445
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,184
You don't have to pour gasoline
on yourself and light a match...

446
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,588
just to break up with me.

447
00:31:25,658 --> 00:31:27,751
Just tell me the truth.

448
00:31:27,827 --> 00:31:31,422
I was not seeing anyone else.
I really was attacked.

449
00:31:41,073 --> 00:31:45,100
- I've got a cut here.
- Okay, I see it now. I'm sorry.

450
00:31:45,178 --> 00:31:47,669
I love you.
What are you gonna do?

451
00:31:49,515 --> 00:31:51,449
You don't have to say it back...

452
00:31:51,517 --> 00:31:54,350
although it wouldn't break your jaw
to try.

453
00:31:57,757 --> 00:32:01,124
- You know what the Holy Grail is?
- Holy Grail?

454
00:32:01,194 --> 00:32:04,891
Yeah, I know that one.
That was like Jesus' juice glass.

455
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,232
Yeah, I used to be such a Catholic.

456
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:13,568
- You still believe in God?
- You gotta believe in God.

457
00:32:13,639 --> 00:32:18,042
But I don't believe God made men
in His image...

458
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:20,670
'cause most of the shit that happens
is 'cause of men.

459
00:32:20,746 --> 00:32:24,307
No. I think man was made
in the devil's image...

460
00:32:24,383 --> 00:32:26,476
and women were created out of God...

461
00:32:26,552 --> 00:32:30,079
'cause after all, women can have babies,
which is kind of like creating.

462
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:33,887
And which also accounts for the tact
that women are attracted to men.

463
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,862
'Cause let's face it, the devil
is a hell of a lot more interesting.

464
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:41,263
I've slept with some saints in my day,
and I know what I'm talking about.

465
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:42,767
Boring.

466
00:32:43,903 --> 00:32:46,997
So the whole point of life...

467
00:32:47,073 --> 00:32:50,372
I think,
is for men and women...

468
00:32:50,443 --> 00:32:54,675
to get married so that
God and the devil can get together...

469
00:32:54,747 --> 00:32:56,715
and work it out.

470
00:32:58,484 --> 00:33:00,782
Not that we have to get married
or anything.

471
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:03,151
God forbid.

472
00:33:03,222 --> 00:33:06,055
You have a little thing right here.

473
00:33:06,125 --> 00:33:07,717
A pimple?

474
00:33:07,793 --> 00:33:11,251
This stuff is supposed to blend with
my skin. Like it really works.

475
00:33:15,635 --> 00:33:18,604
I don't think I'm up for it tonight,
honey.

476
00:33:19,972 --> 00:33:22,463
I just had
a very traumatic experience.

477
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:23,975
I know.

478
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:27,269
I'm getting sick.

479
00:33:30,516 --> 00:33:33,076
Careful, careful.

480
00:33:33,152 --> 00:33:35,985
Anne, I spent the night
in a boiler room.

481
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:39,790
I'm tired. I'm upset.

482
00:33:40,826 --> 00:33:43,158
I'm not in the mood, okay?

483
00:34:06,852 --> 00:34:06,886
Parry?

484
00:34:06,886 --> 00:34:08,285
Parry?

485
00:35:20,526 --> 00:35:22,858
Can I help you?

486
00:35:22,928 --> 00:35:25,123
I was looking for Parry.

487
00:35:25,197 --> 00:35:27,529
He's not here.

488
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:31,593
The hospital said it would be best
it we kept certain things away from him.

489
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:34,970
There's his real name.
Henry Sagan.

490
00:35:35,041 --> 00:35:37,009
He was a teacher
at Hunter College.

491
00:35:37,076 --> 00:35:40,773
They kept him in a mental place
over on Staten Island.

492
00:35:41,747 --> 00:35:45,342
He did not speak for a year.
Then all of a sudden he started talking.

493
00:35:45,418 --> 00:35:48,114
Only now he's this Parry guy.

494
00:35:49,922 --> 00:35:52,516
He and his wife
used to live upstairs.

495
00:35:52,591 --> 00:35:55,992
When he got released,
they sent him here.

496
00:35:57,897 --> 00:36:00,229
I felt bad.

497
00:36:00,299 --> 00:36:03,894
He couldn't work.
Nobody wanted him.

498
00:36:03,969 --> 00:36:06,062
So I let him stay in the basement.

499
00:36:06,138 --> 00:36:09,596
He helped out.
I gave him a couple of dollars.

500
00:36:09,675 --> 00:36:12,075
People throw things away,
he gets them.

501
00:36:13,279 --> 00:36:16,305
She was a beautiful girl.

502
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:18,509
He was crazy about her.

503
00:36:20,619 --> 00:36:23,019
I appreciate the way
you deal with people.

504
00:36:23,089 --> 00:36:26,115
- I really do. I'm a big fan.
- Good. I enjoy appreciation.

505
00:36:26,192 --> 00:36:30,390
I especially appreciated the other day
when you told that homeless schmuck...

506
00:36:30,463 --> 00:36:34,957
who does he think he is
talking about the money that you made.

507
00:36:35,034 --> 00:36:38,697
Who was he to ask Jack Lucas anything?

508
00:36:38,771 --> 00:36:40,898
- Asshole.
- A scumbag like that?

509
00:36:40,973 --> 00:36:44,704
I liked the way you dealt with him.

510
00:36:44,777 --> 00:36:46,836
It was perfect Jack Lucas style.

511
00:36:46,912 --> 00:36:49,380
I listen to you every day,
and I'm telling you...

512
00:36:49,448 --> 00:36:52,940
you are a consistent,
integral man.

513
00:36:53,018 --> 00:36:55,714
What's the matter, baby?
Can't sleep?

514
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:01,992
Yeah.

515
00:37:03,162 --> 00:37:05,096
I'll tell you something, Anne.

516
00:37:05,831 --> 00:37:08,356
I really feel cursed.

517
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:12,200
Stop it.
Things will change.

518
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:14,933
I feel like I'm a magnet,
but I attract shit.

519
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:18,436
Out of all the people in the city...

520
00:37:18,511 --> 00:37:20,775
why did I meet a man
whose wife I killed?

521
00:37:20,846 --> 00:37:23,872
You didn't kill anybody.
Stop it.

522
00:37:25,084 --> 00:37:27,052
I wish there was some way I could...

523
00:37:28,721 --> 00:37:32,987
just pay the tine and go home.

524
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:42,326
I know, I know.

525
00:37:43,669 --> 00:37:45,102
Oh, baby.

526
00:38:09,061 --> 00:38:10,995
Have you seen Parry?

527
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,775
Deign, Princess,
to remember thy faithful slave...

528
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:36,378
who now endures such misery
for love of thee.

529
00:38:39,158 --> 00:38:41,718
- Parry?
- Hi, Jack.

530
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:48,466
- I thought you could use a couple--
- Come on.

531
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:02,036
She'll be back.

532
00:39:09,822 --> 00:39:11,255
Isn't she a vision?

533
00:39:11,323 --> 00:39:12,881
Yeah, gorgeous.

534
00:39:12,958 --> 00:39:14,892
I just wanted to--

535
00:39:16,495 --> 00:39:18,588
Wait. Hey, look.

536
00:39:18,664 --> 00:39:21,326
I'm leaving.
I just wanted to give you--

537
00:39:23,068 --> 00:39:24,330
Shit!

538
00:39:26,939 --> 00:39:28,372
Wait.

539
00:39:29,174 --> 00:39:30,607
Now!

540
00:39:33,078 --> 00:39:35,478
No. Come here.

541
00:39:35,547 --> 00:39:37,139
This way.

542
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:38,649
Down!

543
00:39:46,325 --> 00:39:48,759
She buys a new book every two days.

544
00:39:51,096 --> 00:39:54,088
Hey, sweetheart!
What the hell you doing?

545
00:39:54,166 --> 00:39:56,760
She's into trash,
but what are you going to do?

546
00:40:08,013 --> 00:40:09,446
Come here.

547
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,681
She loves dumplings.

548
00:40:14,753 --> 00:40:16,812
That's her Wednesday ritual.

549
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:22,025
It's so sweet
how she does that every time.

550
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:27,899
We're looking through the window!
You got a problem with that, buddy?

551
00:40:28,901 --> 00:40:32,029
I'm looking through the tucking window.
Come on, let's go.

552
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:42,410
It anybody told me I'd love a girl who
chews jawbreakers, I'd say they're nuts.

553
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:44,346
Look at that jaw.

554
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,415
There she goes.

555
00:40:57,262 --> 00:40:59,196
You follow her every day?

556
00:40:59,264 --> 00:41:02,324
It's not like that.
I'm deeply smitten.

557
00:41:02,401 --> 00:41:04,961
- What's her name?
- I don't know.

558
00:41:05,037 --> 00:41:06,470
A cooler!

559
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:10,472
That's beautiful.
It needs a little work.

560
00:41:10,542 --> 00:41:12,840
Here. Come here.

561
00:41:12,911 --> 00:41:15,675
I just would like to help you.

562
00:41:16,482 --> 00:41:17,915
Fifty dollars?

563
00:41:17,983 --> 00:41:20,008
All right, look.

564
00:41:20,085 --> 00:41:22,383
Here's another $20.
Will that do it?

565
00:41:22,454 --> 00:41:23,887
Seventy dollars?

566
00:41:25,591 --> 00:41:28,526
How much is this gonna take?

567
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,420
You're so nice.

568
00:41:32,765 --> 00:41:34,198
That's okay.

569
00:41:34,266 --> 00:41:36,200
You mensch, you.

570
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:40,904
Can I take you to lunch?

571
00:41:40,973 --> 00:41:42,941
No. I gotta go back to work.

572
00:41:44,443 --> 00:41:46,377
Take care of yourself.

573
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:59,423
Sell !

574
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,058
Buy!

575
00:42:12,604 --> 00:42:14,003
Fuck 'em all!

576
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:16,234
What are you doing?
Give that back!

577
00:42:18,277 --> 00:42:21,269
What are you doing?
Let go! Let go!

578
00:42:21,346 --> 00:42:24,679
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Why did you do that?

579
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:27,412
- I gave that to you !
- What will I do with it?

580
00:42:27,486 --> 00:42:31,820
I gave it to you to help you,
not him.

581
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:34,324
Do you really want to help me?

582
00:42:44,636 --> 00:42:46,570
Okay, open your eyes.

583
00:42:46,638 --> 00:42:49,766
Pretty impressive, huh?
But don't let it scare you.

584
00:42:49,842 --> 00:42:53,608
As formidable as it seems, everything
has its weakness. There's no moat.

585
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:57,342
You can't just break into
Langdon Carmichael's house.

586
00:42:57,416 --> 00:42:59,782
- This man's done nothing--
- Hey! I'll deal with this.

587
00:42:59,852 --> 00:43:01,843
Let's go through this one more time.

588
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,013
Listen to me.

589
00:43:04,089 --> 00:43:07,024
Don't start drooling or rolling
your eyes when I tell you this.

590
00:43:07,092 --> 00:43:10,255
You shouldn't be doing this.
There is no Holy Grail.

591
00:43:10,329 --> 00:43:15,130
Oh, Jack! Ye of little faith.
There has to be a grail.

592
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,464
What were the crusades?
The pope's publicity stunt?

593
00:43:17,536 --> 00:43:19,766
You heathen!
There's a grail.

594
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:21,863
Wait a minute. Look.

595
00:43:23,108 --> 00:43:25,372
You're only partly insane.

596
00:43:25,444 --> 00:43:29,403
People like you can lead
semi-normal lives. You can get a job.

597
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:32,143
I have a job, Jack.
I have a quest.

598
00:43:33,252 --> 00:43:35,652
I take it back.
You're tucking deranged.

599
00:43:35,721 --> 00:43:38,019
You'll get killed
trying to get in there.

600
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:40,750
That's so sweet.

601
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:44,091
I know what you're trying to do.
You're trying to protect me.

602
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:45,892
You think there's danger.

603
00:43:45,964 --> 00:43:49,900
I think you're a moron,
and I don't want to get in trouble.

604
00:43:49,968 --> 00:43:51,401
You care.

605
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:53,267
First the money, now this.

606
00:43:53,338 --> 00:43:56,364
That's so sweet!
You fabulous guy!

607
00:43:57,576 --> 00:43:59,669
Don't hug me in public again.

608
00:43:59,745 --> 00:44:03,272
Men with men. Oh, Jack!
I love this guy!

609
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:07,917
You hear me?
I love this guy!

610
00:44:07,986 --> 00:44:09,920
You hear me, jaded city?

611
00:44:09,988 --> 00:44:13,048
I love Jack! He cares!

612
00:44:13,125 --> 00:44:16,288
In this jaded motherfucking city,
that you--

613
00:44:16,361 --> 00:44:17,953
Will you shut up?

614
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:20,396
I'm loopy about this guy!

615
00:44:20,465 --> 00:44:22,558
Oh, Jack!

616
00:44:22,634 --> 00:44:26,092
You're a real human being.
You're a friend.

617
00:44:26,171 --> 00:44:28,537
A true friend.

618
00:44:28,607 --> 00:44:30,871
I'm not, believe me.

619
00:44:32,344 --> 00:44:35,802
- I'm scum.
- I'm not gonna listen.

620
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:40,215
- You're an honest-to-goodness good guy.
- I'm self-centered, I'm weak.

621
00:44:40,285 --> 00:44:43,254
I don't have the willpower
of a fly on shit.

622
00:44:43,322 --> 00:44:46,086
That's why the little people sent you.
They knew that. It's like magic.

623
00:44:46,158 --> 00:44:49,389
I don't believe in little
floating people, okay?

624
00:44:49,461 --> 00:44:51,588
There is no magic.

625
00:44:52,631 --> 00:44:56,067
But you're still gonna help me.
That's what matters.

626
00:44:56,134 --> 00:44:59,729
Parry, or whatever your name is,
you know none of this is true.

627
00:44:59,805 --> 00:45:03,400
The grail, the voices. There's a part
of you that knows it's not true!

628
00:45:03,475 --> 00:45:06,342
- We have to start planning now.
- Listen to me!

629
00:45:06,411 --> 00:45:08,971
Jack, you're acting weird.

630
00:45:10,148 --> 00:45:13,845
- I know who you are.
- Jack, let go of me!

631
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:16,353
You used to teach at Hunter College.

632
00:45:16,421 --> 00:45:19,151
Parry, you're a teacher.

633
00:45:41,513 --> 00:45:43,777
What are you looking at?

634
00:45:49,921 --> 00:45:51,354
What?

635
00:45:56,862 --> 00:45:59,126
He's afraid of you.

636
00:46:01,533 --> 00:46:03,865
We've got him!
Come on !

637
00:46:07,606 --> 00:46:09,130
Holy shit!

638
00:46:29,928 --> 00:46:32,419
Yes! I got him, Jack!

639
00:47:00,058 --> 00:47:01,525
Yes!

640
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:13,532
I've got you!

641
00:47:46,671 --> 00:47:48,104
I'm dying.

642
00:47:49,274 --> 00:47:51,208
I can't breathe.

643
00:47:53,145 --> 00:47:55,306
Isn't this a beautiful spot?

644
00:47:57,149 --> 00:48:00,243
Who have we been chasing?
Can I ask this question now?

645
00:48:02,053 --> 00:48:03,987
He's gone now.

646
00:48:04,055 --> 00:48:08,788
We had him on the run, didn't we? If
we'd had horses, we'd have had his ass.

647
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:11,488
- Who?
- What?

648
00:48:13,298 --> 00:48:15,425
Who have we been chasing?

649
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,434
I thought you saw him.

650
00:48:17,502 --> 00:48:18,992
Saw who?

651
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:20,799
The Red Knight.

652
00:48:26,678 --> 00:48:28,111
I gave you money.

653
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:32,617
You want to keep it, tine.
You want to give it away, fine.

654
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:37,380
I just want You to know
I did give him the money, okay?

655
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:39,390
Are we clear?

656
00:48:42,194 --> 00:48:44,685
Who are you talking to?

657
00:48:46,598 --> 00:48:49,158
Help me, somebody!

658
00:48:49,234 --> 00:48:50,633
Please!

659
00:48:50,702 --> 00:48:54,297
Heaven be praised for the opportunity
to fulfill the duties of my profession.

660
00:48:57,476 --> 00:49:01,378
These cries proceed from a miserable
male or female in need of my protection.

661
00:49:02,747 --> 00:49:04,681
This is too hard.

662
00:49:05,617 --> 00:49:07,380
Help me!

663
00:49:07,452 --> 00:49:12,014
Will you, lady on the horse,
please trample me?

664
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:13,523
Over here.

665
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:18,151
No! Get away from me!

666
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:20,698
I'm not gonna hurt you.

667
00:49:20,765 --> 00:49:25,134
That's what the other guy said.
Leave me alone! Please!

668
00:49:25,203 --> 00:49:29,606
- I want to help you.
- No. I want to go. Let me go now.

669
00:49:29,674 --> 00:49:32,700
They knocked the stuffing--
Come on. Let me help you up.

670
00:49:32,777 --> 00:49:36,941
No. I want a debutante on a horse
to step on me.

671
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:39,074
Leave me alone.

672
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:41,812
Sorry to tell you this, but the days
of the debutantes are over.

673
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:43,821
Isn't it awful?

674
00:49:43,889 --> 00:49:45,982
Poor little Gloria.

675
00:49:46,057 --> 00:49:48,287
Poor Brenda Frazier.

676
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,454
They ruined them.
They ate them alive.

677
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,896
What about Slim Keith,
that little Guggenheim girl?

678
00:49:53,965 --> 00:49:57,366
Impostors!
Leave me alone.

679
00:49:57,435 --> 00:50:00,700
- Come on, lend a hand.
- He needs to sleep it off.

680
00:50:00,772 --> 00:50:03,741
- Somebody will take care of him.
- Who? Mother Teresa? She's retired.

681
00:50:03,808 --> 00:50:06,368
- It's just us. Let's go.
- Maybe he wants to stay here.

682
00:50:06,444 --> 00:50:11,381
- You want to stay here?
- Sure. I'll love bleeding in horseshit.

683
00:50:11,449 --> 00:50:13,974
How very "Gandhi-esque" of you.

684
00:50:16,488 --> 00:50:18,615
Get out of the way!

685
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,888
Dr. Klein to physiotherapy.

686
00:50:24,963 --> 00:50:29,195
Please! I was born in a place like this.
I don't want to be here.

687
00:50:29,267 --> 00:50:30,700
- Please.
- Come on.

688
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:34,429
Jack, take care of him.

689
00:50:34,506 --> 00:50:38,101
No, no. I want to go.
Please let me go.

690
00:50:38,176 --> 00:50:42,670
- Where do you want to go?
- To a nice place I know about.

691
00:50:42,747 --> 00:50:46,547
- Maybe we can go there later.
- We can't go there tonight.

692
00:50:46,618 --> 00:50:49,587
- Maybe we can. Where do you want to go?
- We can't.

693
00:50:56,695 --> 00:51:00,426
Come on. Maybe we can.
Where do you want to go?

694
00:51:00,498 --> 00:51:01,988
Venice.

695
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:06,434
Like Katharine Hepburn
in "Summertime."

696
00:51:06,504 --> 00:51:09,337
Why can't I be Katharine Hepburn?

697
00:51:10,542 --> 00:51:13,033
I want to die!

698
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:15,045
I just want to die.

699
00:51:16,214 --> 00:51:19,115
That's it.
Okay, ready?

700
00:51:19,184 --> 00:51:21,778
I like New York in June

701
00:51:21,853 --> 00:51:23,821
- I'm in the wrong place.
- Aren't we all?

702
00:51:23,888 --> 00:51:27,187
I like a Gershwin tune

703
00:51:27,258 --> 00:51:29,192
Don't hold back. Okay!

704
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:32,127
- I like to read good books
- What will I do with the children?

705
00:51:32,197 --> 00:51:34,757
Where am I gonna put them?
Goddamn daughter-in-law!

706
00:51:34,833 --> 00:51:36,994
Comes in the house
looking for dust balls.

707
00:51:37,068 --> 00:51:40,663
Get the fuck out of my dining room,
you asshole!

708
00:51:40,739 --> 00:51:43,105
That's wonderful feeling,
but you're stretching.

709
00:51:43,174 --> 00:51:45,836
Come on, tempo.
Allegro, people, allegro.

710
00:51:47,112 --> 00:51:48,545
When you--

711
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:56,710
Did you lose your mind all of a sudden,
or was it a slow, gradual process?

712
00:51:59,891 --> 00:52:01,324
Well...

713
00:52:02,727 --> 00:52:04,752
I'm a singer by trade.

714
00:52:05,797 --> 00:52:08,698
Summer stock, nightclub reviews,
that sort of thing.

715
00:52:08,767 --> 00:52:11,292
And God,
I absolutely lived for it.

716
00:52:12,537 --> 00:52:16,530
I can do "Gypsy." Every part.
I can do it backwards.

717
00:52:16,608 --> 00:52:19,543
Then one night, right in the middle
of singing "Funny"...

718
00:52:19,611 --> 00:52:21,545
suddenly it hit me.

719
00:52:21,613 --> 00:52:24,377
What does all this mean?

720
00:52:24,449 --> 00:52:28,146
I mean, that, plus the tact
I'd watched all my friends die.

721
00:52:32,223 --> 00:52:34,589
Sound like a veteran, don't l?

722
00:52:34,659 --> 00:52:36,684
- Fuck off!
- My dad would be so proud of me.

723
00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:40,728
- Pizza!
- It's about time.

724
00:53:01,319 --> 00:53:03,446
Never gonna find her in this crowd.

725
00:53:03,521 --> 00:53:08,083
She's like clockwork. She comes
through here at the same time every day.

726
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:09,751
She's late.

727
00:53:13,765 --> 00:53:15,198
Thank you.

728
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:20,068
Parry?

729
00:53:20,138 --> 00:53:22,436
Did you hear Jimmy Nichols
got picked up yesterday?

730
00:53:26,878 --> 00:53:28,311
Oh, yeah?

731
00:53:28,379 --> 00:53:30,973
He got caught
pissing on a bookstore.

732
00:53:31,049 --> 00:53:32,983
Man's a pig.

733
00:53:33,051 --> 00:53:36,043
No excuse for that.
Thank you, babe.

734
00:53:36,121 --> 00:53:39,352
We're headed for social anarchy
when people start pissing on bookstores.

735
00:53:42,627 --> 00:53:45,960
Asshole.
Didn't even look at you.

736
00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:49,625
Well, he's paying
so he don't have to look.

737
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:56,434
A guy goes to work every day,
8 hours a day, 7 days a week.

738
00:53:56,508 --> 00:53:58,442
Gets his nuts so tight...

739
00:53:58,510 --> 00:54:02,537
he starts questioning
the very fabric of his existence.

740
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:05,447
Then one day about quittin' time...

741
00:54:05,517 --> 00:54:07,985
the boss calls him into the office
and says...

742
00:54:08,052 --> 00:54:11,613
"Bob, come on in here and kiss my ass
for me, will you?"

743
00:54:12,824 --> 00:54:15,816
He says, "Hell with it.

744
00:54:15,894 --> 00:54:17,828
I don't care what happens.

745
00:54:19,264 --> 00:54:21,198
I just want to see his expression...

746
00:54:21,266 --> 00:54:24,394
as I jam these scissors
into his arm."

747
00:54:27,705 --> 00:54:30,230
Then he thinks of me.

748
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:32,333
He says, "Wait a minute.

749
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:34,640
I got both my arms, both my legs.

750
00:54:34,712 --> 00:54:37,840
At least I'm not begging
for a living."

751
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:42,711
Sure enough, Bob's gonna put
those scissors down and pucker up.

752
00:54:42,787 --> 00:54:47,451
I'm what you call a kind of
moral traffic light.

753
00:54:47,525 --> 00:54:50,983
I'm like saying,
"Red. Go no further."

754
00:57:14,405 --> 00:57:15,440
I do not need this!

755
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,772
I do not need this!

756
00:57:19,744 --> 00:57:22,144
A woman my age?

757
00:57:22,213 --> 00:57:25,705
I'm a person. There's a person here.
This is kid's stuff.

758
00:57:25,783 --> 00:57:29,150
You come, you go.
All I do is cook like a jerk.

759
00:57:31,356 --> 00:57:33,290
You're a waste of good lasagna.

760
00:57:34,959 --> 00:57:37,928
I don't need this.
Find yourself another dope.

761
00:57:43,101 --> 00:57:45,069
He's a son of a bitch.

762
00:57:57,048 --> 00:57:59,983
God, what a beautiful night, Jack.

763
00:58:00,051 --> 00:58:02,485
Don't you think it's time to go?

764
00:58:03,454 --> 00:58:05,581
Running around here during the day
is one thing, but at night...

765
00:58:05,656 --> 00:58:08,648
we could be killed
by a variety of people.

766
00:58:08,726 --> 00:58:10,660
That's stupid, Jack.

767
00:58:11,829 --> 00:58:14,559
This park is mine
as much as it is theirs.

768
00:58:14,632 --> 00:58:19,194
Do you think it's fair they keep us out
because we might get killed?

769
00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:21,568
- Yes, I think it's very fair.
- I don't.

770
00:58:21,639 --> 00:58:24,403
- What are you doing?
- I'm cloud busting.

771
00:58:24,475 --> 00:58:26,568
Have you ever done it?
You lie on your back...

772
00:58:26,644 --> 00:58:29,238
concentrate on the clouds and
break them apart with your mind.

773
00:58:29,313 --> 00:58:33,010
It's wild. But you have to be nude.
You can't diffuse the psychic energy.

774
00:58:33,084 --> 00:58:36,247
This is New York. No one's allowed
to be naked in a field in New York.

775
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,220
It's too midwestern.

776
00:58:38,289 --> 00:58:40,314
It's wild. It's really treeing.

777
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:43,588
The air on your body, the nipples are
hard, little guy dangling in the wind.

778
00:58:43,661 --> 00:58:47,153
Come on. You're pissing me off.

779
00:58:47,231 --> 00:58:49,665
We're bare-assed naked
in the middle of it.

780
00:58:49,734 --> 00:58:52,760
I'm not doing this. This is nuts.
I'm leaving.

781
00:58:52,837 --> 00:58:56,466
Free yourself. You know why dogs
do this? 'Cause it feels good.

782
00:58:56,541 --> 00:58:59,567
- I'm not doing that.
- Yes!

783
00:58:59,644 --> 00:59:04,479
- I'm leaving.
- Come on, Jack. Get back to your roots.

784
00:59:04,549 --> 00:59:07,643
The man talks to invisible people,
he sees invisible horses.

785
00:59:08,953 --> 00:59:11,387
He's lying naked in the middle
of Central Park.

786
00:59:11,456 --> 00:59:14,254
I'm not surprised. I'm out of
my tucking mind to even be here!

787
00:59:14,325 --> 00:59:16,259
Who are you talking to?

788
00:59:17,862 --> 00:59:21,195
- I'm talking to the little people.
- Are they here?

789
00:59:21,265 --> 00:59:24,462
They're saying, "Jack, go to
the nearest liquor store...

790
00:59:24,535 --> 00:59:26,469
findeth the Jack of Daniels...

791
00:59:26,537 --> 00:59:28,596
that ye may be shit-taced!"

792
00:59:30,241 --> 00:59:34,302
- They said that?
- You are out of your tucking mind!

793
00:59:34,378 --> 00:59:36,437
Bingo!

794
00:59:36,514 --> 00:59:40,280
Come on ! Free up the little guy.
let him flap in the breeze!

795
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:44,453
Oh, Jack!

796
00:59:46,724 --> 00:59:48,817
Nothing's happening.

797
00:59:48,893 --> 00:59:50,326
Concentrate.

798
00:59:50,394 --> 00:59:52,521
What it some homophobic jogger
kills us...

799
00:59:52,597 --> 00:59:54,792
to get back at his father?

800
00:59:55,533 --> 00:59:59,970
"Jack Lucas found dead
next to a dead naked man.

801
01:00:00,037 --> 01:00:03,336
The two were dead,
his companion was naked."

802
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:08,434
I hate it when they use the word
"companion." It's so insinuating.

803
01:00:08,513 --> 01:00:10,947
Probably boosts the sales
of my biography.

804
01:00:11,015 --> 01:00:14,974
The public is fascinated with celebrity
murders that involve nakedness.

805
01:00:15,052 --> 01:00:16,519
Bastards.

806
01:00:16,587 --> 01:00:21,047
I may be going out on a limb, but you
don't seem like a happy camper.

807
01:00:25,596 --> 01:00:28,531
Did you ever hear the story
of the Fisher King?

808
01:00:32,403 --> 01:00:36,362
It begins with the king as a boy having
to spend the night alone in a forest...

809
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:39,807
to prove his courage
so he can become king.

810
01:00:40,912 --> 01:00:43,904
While he's spending the night alone...

811
01:00:43,981 --> 01:00:46,711
he's visited by a sacred vision.

812
01:00:46,784 --> 01:00:50,686
Out of the fire appears
the Holy Grail...

813
01:00:50,755 --> 01:00:53,246
the symbol of God's divine grace.

814
01:00:54,458 --> 01:00:56,392
And a voice said to the boy.

815
01:00:56,460 --> 01:01:00,863
"You shall be keeper of the grail
so that it may heal the hearts of men."

816
01:01:02,233 --> 01:01:04,895
But the boy was blinded
by greater visions of a life...

817
01:01:04,969 --> 01:01:08,234
filled with power
and glory and beauty.

818
01:01:09,974 --> 01:01:13,273
In this state
of radical amazement...

819
01:01:13,344 --> 01:01:16,780
he felt for a brief moment
not like a boy...

820
01:01:16,847 --> 01:01:19,179
but invincible...

821
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:20,877
like God.

822
01:01:20,952 --> 01:01:24,444
So he reached in the fire
to take the grail...

823
01:01:24,522 --> 01:01:27,286
and the grail vanished...

824
01:01:27,358 --> 01:01:31,488
leaving him with his hand in the tire
to be terribly wounded.

825
01:01:32,697 --> 01:01:35,723
Now, as this boy grew older...

826
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,791
his wound grew deeper...

827
01:01:38,669 --> 01:01:40,967
until one day...

828
01:01:41,038 --> 01:01:43,370
life for him lost its reason.

829
01:01:44,742 --> 01:01:47,438
He had no faith in any man,
not even himself.

830
01:01:48,512 --> 01:01:51,845
He couldn't love or feel loved.

831
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:53,975
He was sick with experience.

832
01:01:54,051 --> 01:01:56,417
He began to die.

833
01:01:57,888 --> 01:02:00,948
One day, a fool wandered
into the castle...

834
01:02:01,025 --> 01:02:02,959
and found the king alone.

835
01:02:04,428 --> 01:02:08,228
Being a tool, he was simpleminded.
He didn't see a king.

836
01:02:08,299 --> 01:02:12,429
He only saw a man alone
and in pain.

837
01:02:12,503 --> 01:02:15,939
He asked the king,
"What ails you, friend?"

838
01:02:16,007 --> 01:02:17,941
The king replied...

839
01:02:18,009 --> 01:02:21,740
"I'm thirsty. I need some water
to cool my throat."

840
01:02:24,548 --> 01:02:28,848
So the fool took a cup from beside
his bed, tilled it with water...

841
01:02:28,919 --> 01:02:31,353
and handed it to the king.

842
01:02:31,422 --> 01:02:33,822
As the king began to drink...

843
01:02:33,891 --> 01:02:37,224
he realized his wound was healed.

844
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:39,991
He looked in his hands,
and there was the Holy Grail...

845
01:02:40,064 --> 01:02:42,157
that which he sought
all of his life.

846
01:02:42,233 --> 01:02:44,292
He turned to the tool
and said with amazement...

847
01:02:44,368 --> 01:02:48,566
"How could you find that which
my brightest and bravest could not?"

848
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:54,143
The tool replied, "I don't know.

849
01:02:54,211 --> 01:02:57,408
I only knew
that you were thirsty."

850
01:02:59,517 --> 01:03:01,485
It's beautiful, isn't it?

851
01:03:07,091 --> 01:03:10,959
I think I heard that
at a lecture once. I don't know.

852
01:03:12,430 --> 01:03:15,490
It was a professor...

853
01:03:17,902 --> 01:03:19,767
at Hunter.

854
01:03:43,294 --> 01:03:46,786
How come you never asked
that girl for a date?

855
01:03:46,864 --> 01:03:48,957
I can't ask her.
I have to earn her.

856
01:03:49,033 --> 01:03:52,992
This is the 20th century.
You don't have to earn a woman.

857
01:03:53,070 --> 01:03:55,334
Maybe after we get the grail.

858
01:03:55,406 --> 01:03:58,068
She could help you get the grail.

859
01:03:58,142 --> 01:04:00,975
Women are great.

860
01:04:01,045 --> 01:04:05,106
They make homes
and they kill the livestock...

861
01:04:05,182 --> 01:04:07,707
so the knights can go out there
and get grails...

862
01:04:07,785 --> 01:04:10,083
and slaughter villages
with a clear head.

863
01:04:10,154 --> 01:04:13,487
Where would King Arthur be
without Guinevere?

864
01:04:13,557 --> 01:04:16,219
Happily married, probably.

865
01:04:16,293 --> 01:04:19,319
Well, that's a bad example,
but trust me on this.

866
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:21,763
A woman who loves you...

867
01:04:21,832 --> 01:04:23,857
keeps you going,
gives you strength...

868
01:04:23,934 --> 01:04:26,402
makes you feel
like you can do anything.

869
01:04:26,470 --> 01:04:29,303
Is that what your girlfriend
does for you?

870
01:04:30,374 --> 01:04:32,205
Sure. Yeah.

871
01:05:09,747 --> 01:05:12,807
Get out of the fucking way!

872
01:05:35,005 --> 01:05:38,338
Yes. Two Hearts Publishing?

873
01:05:38,409 --> 01:05:40,809
May I speak to Lydia, please?

874
01:05:40,878 --> 01:05:42,402
Lydia?

875
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,778
- Who is Lydia?
- I don't know her last name.

876
01:05:44,849 --> 01:05:48,478
You are calling Lydia
from my apartment?

877
01:05:48,552 --> 01:05:52,716
You must think I am some kind of dope,
you son of a bitch.

878
01:05:52,790 --> 01:05:55,554
You stay out all night long.
I don't get a phone call.

879
01:05:55,626 --> 01:05:57,753
You stroll in here at noon.

880
01:05:57,828 --> 01:05:59,989
You think I need this?

881
01:06:03,767 --> 01:06:06,998
I was not out with a woman last night.
I was with Parry.

882
01:06:07,071 --> 01:06:09,904
- The moron?
- He's not a moron.

883
01:06:09,974 --> 01:06:12,238
Who's Lydia?

884
01:06:12,309 --> 01:06:16,006
Lydia is the girl
that Parry likes.

885
01:06:17,715 --> 01:06:19,808
I thought--

886
01:06:19,884 --> 01:06:22,375
- What did you think?
- You wouldn't understand.

887
01:06:22,453 --> 01:06:27,117
Don't talk to me like I'm stupid.
That pisses me off.

888
01:06:27,191 --> 01:06:31,423
- I'm sorry. I feel indebted to the guy.
- What does that mean?

889
01:06:31,495 --> 01:06:33,963
- There! You see?
- What does it mean?

890
01:06:34,031 --> 01:06:38,331
I thought it I could help him
in some way...

891
01:06:38,402 --> 01:06:41,371
get him this girl that he loves...

892
01:06:41,438 --> 01:06:45,374
that maybe things would change for me.

893
01:06:52,349 --> 01:06:54,647
Forget it.
It's a dumb fucking idea.

894
01:06:58,155 --> 01:07:01,420
You big galoot.
You are such a mess.

895
01:07:07,698 --> 01:07:09,325
Listen.

896
01:07:10,634 --> 01:07:12,363
Stranger things...

897
01:07:13,737 --> 01:07:15,796
have been known...

898
01:07:17,875 --> 01:07:19,308
to happen.

899
01:07:34,024 --> 01:07:35,821
Hello? Hello?

900
01:07:38,762 --> 01:07:40,286
Who is this?

901
01:07:40,364 --> 01:07:41,831
Hello, Lydia.

902
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:47,166
This is Jack Lucas. I'm calling
from Video Spot Video Rentals.

903
01:07:47,237 --> 01:07:51,264
You are a major credit card holder,
are you not?

904
01:07:51,342 --> 01:07:55,506
Well, I've got some good news for you.

905
01:07:55,579 --> 01:07:59,743
In conjunction with several
credit card companies--

906
01:07:59,817 --> 01:08:03,014
- Which ones? Which ones?
- All of them.

907
01:08:03,087 --> 01:08:07,217
Which means that you have won
a tree membership at our store.

908
01:08:11,328 --> 01:08:13,455
How did this happen?

909
01:08:14,932 --> 01:08:18,390
My name was--
What was-- How--

910
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:22,371
Is my name on a list?
Did you pick it out of a hat?

911
01:08:22,439 --> 01:08:23,497
A list.

912
01:08:23,574 --> 01:08:26,338
Were there people in the room
or just you?

913
01:08:26,410 --> 01:08:28,207
There were--

914
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:31,509
- What's the difference?
- I don't--

915
01:08:31,582 --> 01:08:34,551
This phone--
I've never won anything in my life...

916
01:08:34,618 --> 01:08:37,553
and I don't even have a VCR.

917
01:08:37,621 --> 01:08:42,217
You'll get a free VCR with
the membership until you get your own.

918
01:08:42,292 --> 01:08:45,056
Listen. Why don't you
come down to the store...

919
01:08:45,129 --> 01:08:47,723
check it out,
see if you're interested?

920
01:08:47,798 --> 01:08:50,232
Did Phyllis tell you to call me?

921
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:53,235
Did Phyllis in accounting do that?

922
01:08:53,303 --> 01:08:56,329
No. I told you,
you won a contest.

923
01:08:56,407 --> 01:08:58,932
you have just--

924
01:08:59,009 --> 01:09:01,705
This is going to be rough.

925
01:09:04,181 --> 01:09:06,206
It's going to be rough.

926
01:09:14,191 --> 01:09:17,058
I need to warm up.

927
01:09:17,127 --> 01:09:20,961
I'm Anne Morrow Lindbergh.
I can't find my baby!

928
01:09:22,666 --> 01:09:24,896
I knew I could make you smile.

929
01:09:27,337 --> 01:09:30,397
Come on. Look, one chorus
and then you're out of there.

930
01:09:30,474 --> 01:09:32,738
I'm a man with a mission.

931
01:09:34,178 --> 01:09:37,306
I can't believe I'm on
a first-name basis with these people.

932
01:09:40,517 --> 01:09:42,109
Can I help you?

933
01:09:42,186 --> 01:09:44,746
Is there a mousy woman named Lydia
who works here?

934
01:09:44,822 --> 01:09:46,483
Yes. I'll get her--

935
01:09:46,557 --> 01:09:50,994
- I have to give it to her in person.
- You can't go back there.

936
01:10:00,304 --> 01:10:01,931
Lydia Sinclair?

937
01:10:12,416 --> 01:10:15,078
You must be she.

938
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:24,087
I had a dream

939
01:10:24,161 --> 01:10:27,927
A dream for guess who, Lydia

940
01:10:28,732 --> 01:10:32,691
It wasn't for her, Lydia

941
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:38,265
It's only for you, yes, Lydia

942
01:10:41,345 --> 01:10:44,644
Some people can get their kicks

943
01:10:44,715 --> 01:10:48,151
Watching Koppel and late-night flicks

944
01:10:48,218 --> 01:10:52,120
That's okay for some people

945
01:10:52,189 --> 01:10:55,750
Who don't own VCRs

946
01:10:55,826 --> 01:10:58,522
But, Lydia

947
01:10:58,595 --> 01:11:02,361
You've won our grand prize

948
01:11:02,432 --> 01:11:04,491
Just think of it

949
01:11:04,568 --> 01:11:07,969
All the movies you'll watch for free now
Dramas, westerns, comedies, wow

950
01:11:08,038 --> 01:11:10,404
Video Spot has the best selection

951
01:11:10,474 --> 01:11:13,875
If you like porno
We're your connection

952
01:11:13,944 --> 01:11:18,677
And everything's coming up videos

953
01:11:18,749 --> 01:11:23,516
Everything's coming up videos

954
01:11:23,587 --> 01:11:26,556
But this time for free

955
01:11:26,623 --> 01:11:28,488
For you, Lydia

956
01:11:28,559 --> 01:11:33,861
For free

957
01:11:46,643 --> 01:11:48,338
Our card.

958
01:12:00,257 --> 01:12:00,290
It'll be like you work here.

959
01:12:00,290 --> 01:12:02,451
It'll be like you work here.

960
01:12:02,526 --> 01:12:04,653
What am I qualified to do?

961
01:12:04,728 --> 01:12:06,161
Sort.

962
01:12:18,041 --> 01:12:20,134
This will be good.

963
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:22,474
This will make you smell
like a forest.

964
01:12:44,501 --> 01:12:47,664
Hello. My name is Lydia Sinclair.

965
01:12:47,738 --> 01:12:50,070
Oh, hi !
How you doing?

966
01:12:50,140 --> 01:12:52,734
Congratulations. Jack Lucas.
Nice to finally meet you.

967
01:12:52,809 --> 01:12:55,300
This is Anne Napolitano,
the Video Spot owner.

968
01:12:55,379 --> 01:12:57,244
Hello. Congratulations.

969
01:12:57,314 --> 01:12:59,976
And this is our co-worker--

970
01:13:00,050 --> 01:13:01,677
Parry. Parry--

971
01:13:01,752 --> 01:13:03,652
Parry Parry?

972
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:05,187
No, just Parry.

973
01:13:05,255 --> 01:13:07,883
Oh. Like Moses.

974
01:13:13,530 --> 01:13:15,464
How do we do this?

975
01:13:15,532 --> 01:13:19,525
First we'll have you sign out
an official membership card.

976
01:13:19,603 --> 01:13:21,571
Sign that if you would.

977
01:13:21,638 --> 01:13:24,106
We'll have that laminated
for you right here.

978
01:13:24,174 --> 01:13:26,938
Parry, would you like to laminate
Miss Sinclair's card?

979
01:13:27,010 --> 01:13:28,204
Yeah!

980
01:13:28,278 --> 01:13:30,872
This will last for a year,
after which...

981
01:13:30,948 --> 01:13:34,179
you have the option to renew
at a membership discount.

982
01:13:34,251 --> 01:13:37,516
Yeah, but not for free, right?

983
01:13:37,587 --> 01:13:41,023
- You get ten videos.
- Free?

984
01:13:41,091 --> 01:13:43,685
- Free.
- Only the first ten.

985
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:46,524
After that, they're $2.99 a rental.

986
01:13:51,401 --> 01:13:53,596
All right, go on.

987
01:13:53,670 --> 01:13:55,194
Go on.

988
01:14:03,613 --> 01:14:07,572
- Can I help you?
- No. I can look myself.

989
01:14:19,730 --> 01:14:21,925
"Hell Merchants." Good choice.

990
01:14:21,999 --> 01:14:24,331
I don't like horror movies.

991
01:14:26,737 --> 01:14:28,227
How about...

992
01:14:29,439 --> 01:14:32,135
"The Purple Bread"?

993
01:14:32,209 --> 01:14:35,701
It's a Zbieniew Speizak film.
Let's see.

994
01:14:35,779 --> 01:14:40,580
It's set against a sweeping background
of a "polish" bakery.

995
01:14:40,650 --> 01:14:44,643
Polish! That's Polish bakery.
That's why it's in subtitles.

996
01:14:44,721 --> 01:14:47,884
I don't like Polish love stories.

997
01:14:47,958 --> 01:14:50,950
- I like musicals.
- Musicals.

998
01:14:52,195 --> 01:14:53,856
Over here.

999
01:14:53,930 --> 01:14:56,455
Here's our entertainment center.

1000
01:14:56,533 --> 01:14:59,093
Here's Fred Astaire.
That's good.

1001
01:14:59,169 --> 01:15:01,262
Yeah, Jolson! "Mammy."

1002
01:15:01,338 --> 01:15:04,273
- You got any Ethel Merman?
- Ethel Merman. Oh, she's--

1003
01:15:13,917 --> 01:15:16,818
- We're all out of Ethel Merman.
- Oh, what a gyp!

1004
01:15:16,887 --> 01:15:18,445
That sucks.

1005
01:15:19,489 --> 01:15:22,822
I think I actually ordered some
just the other day.

1006
01:15:22,893 --> 01:15:24,656
Did or didn't you?

1007
01:15:24,728 --> 01:15:28,164
Yeah. They'll be in soon.

1008
01:15:31,968 --> 01:15:33,936
I'll come back then.

1009
01:15:35,272 --> 01:15:38,173
Miss Sinclair, your card.
Don't forget it.

1010
01:15:41,445 --> 01:15:43,504
I like your nails.

1011
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:45,571
Where did you get them done?

1012
01:15:45,649 --> 01:15:50,677
Actually, I do them myself.
I used to work in a beauty parlor.

1013
01:15:50,754 --> 01:15:54,485
I like the stars.

1014
01:15:54,558 --> 01:15:57,118
Anne does other people
as a sideline.

1015
01:15:57,194 --> 01:15:59,128
She could do your nails.

1016
01:16:00,297 --> 01:16:03,027
- How much?
- You're a member--

1017
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:04,533
Forty dollars.

1018
01:16:08,905 --> 01:16:11,203
Forty dollars?

1019
01:16:11,274 --> 01:16:13,834
Forty.

1020
01:16:25,589 --> 01:16:27,181
When will you do them?

1021
01:16:27,257 --> 01:16:29,953
- Next--
- Tonight?

1022
01:16:31,428 --> 01:16:32,793
Tonight.

1023
01:16:47,644 --> 01:16:49,805
Thank you.

1024
01:16:52,182 --> 01:16:54,548
You know, getting your nails done
is one thing.

1025
01:16:54,618 --> 01:16:58,054
But going to dinner with strangers,
and that one--

1026
01:16:58,121 --> 01:16:59,884
We'll make it casual.

1027
01:16:59,956 --> 01:17:02,686
- She didn't even look at him.
- It won't be like a date.

1028
01:17:02,759 --> 01:17:05,159
You got any more starchy food?

1029
01:17:08,265 --> 01:17:10,529
Oh, clumsy moi.

1030
01:17:17,174 --> 01:17:18,436
Thank you!

1031
01:17:22,445 --> 01:17:25,710
I've gone out with some bums,
but they were beautiful.

1032
01:17:25,782 --> 01:17:28,182
That is the only reason
to go out with a bum.

1033
01:17:28,251 --> 01:17:31,516
This food is delicious, Anne. Really.

1034
01:17:31,588 --> 01:17:35,581
You're a wonderful cook,
and you have a great set of dishes.

1035
01:17:35,659 --> 01:17:38,856
He's trying to start a conversation.

1036
01:17:38,929 --> 01:17:41,329
Talk to him.
He's not going to bite you.

1037
01:17:42,499 --> 01:17:44,467
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1038
01:17:45,535 --> 01:17:50,472
You know, you are a beautiful woman.
You've got your own business.

1039
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:54,636
I am surprised some guy doesn't
just snatch you up for his own.

1040
01:17:54,711 --> 01:17:57,271
Oh, you're surprised?

1041
01:17:57,347 --> 01:18:00,612
Guess I just never met the right guy.
What are you gonna do?

1042
01:18:00,684 --> 01:18:04,017
You know, I'm shocked.

1043
01:18:04,087 --> 01:18:07,318
A childbearing body like yours!

1044
01:18:07,390 --> 01:18:10,223
A guy would have to be
out of his mind.

1045
01:18:10,293 --> 01:18:12,227
Most guys are.

1046
01:18:16,132 --> 01:18:21,035
You, this incredible woman
going to waste before my very eyes?

1047
01:18:21,104 --> 01:18:24,005
No! This is outrageous!

1048
01:18:24,074 --> 01:18:28,067
- I will not hear this. No!
- Jack, come here.

1049
01:18:28,144 --> 01:18:32,137
I am your man, then.
Let's do it right here.

1050
01:18:32,215 --> 01:18:34,945
Let's go to that place
of splendor in the grass...

1051
01:18:35,018 --> 01:18:38,476
behold my magic wand,
and tree your golden orbs.

1052
01:18:38,555 --> 01:18:40,489
You know what I'm saying.

1053
01:18:40,557 --> 01:18:42,752
Holding my penis

1054
01:18:42,826 --> 01:18:45,727
What a wonderful way
of saying how much you like

1055
01:18:45,795 --> 01:18:48,229
- Parry, close your pants.
- Took you long enough.

1056
01:18:48,298 --> 01:18:51,665
What are you?
About a 40 in a jacket?

1057
01:18:51,735 --> 01:18:53,862
This is gonna work.

1058
01:18:59,209 --> 01:19:02,736
You let me know, 'cause you're
too good a woman to go to waste.

1059
01:19:25,735 --> 01:19:28,465
Oh, welcome.

1060
01:19:28,538 --> 01:19:29,971
Come in.

1061
01:19:33,443 --> 01:19:36,606
I've never been in an apartment
above a store before.

1062
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:39,205
You always walk past them
on the streets...

1063
01:19:39,282 --> 01:19:42,445
but you never really think
anyone really lives in them.

1064
01:19:49,926 --> 01:19:54,454
Can I get you something?
A little coffee? Tea?

1065
01:19:54,531 --> 01:19:56,465
A little tequila?

1066
01:20:07,977 --> 01:20:10,241
Will it hurt?

1067
01:20:10,313 --> 01:20:12,577
That all depends on you.

1068
01:20:12,649 --> 01:20:15,516
You sure you don't want a drink?

1069
01:20:16,886 --> 01:20:20,185
You just enjoy this.
That a boy.

1070
01:20:20,256 --> 01:20:23,384
- This is mud.
- We just washed that oft.

1071
01:20:23,460 --> 01:20:26,691
This is going to make you look great.

1072
01:20:26,763 --> 01:20:28,731
It's good mud.

1073
01:20:30,767 --> 01:20:32,200
Close...

1074
01:20:33,203 --> 01:20:34,636
lips.

1075
01:20:38,441 --> 01:20:40,966
- Close.
- What are you doing?

1076
01:20:43,012 --> 01:20:47,449
There we go.
Now, you just relax.

1077
01:20:48,518 --> 01:20:52,614
So, anybody special in your life?

1078
01:20:52,689 --> 01:20:56,090
Does it look like
there's anybody special in my life?

1079
01:20:57,560 --> 01:20:59,824
You don't have to say it like that.

1080
01:20:59,896 --> 01:21:03,957
It's not so crazy an idea.
You're a healthy woman.

1081
01:21:04,033 --> 01:21:07,332
You have a steady job.
You're not cross-eyed or anything.

1082
01:21:07,404 --> 01:21:11,170
- There is nobody special.
- Okay. Fine.

1083
01:21:13,610 --> 01:21:17,171
It's not easy
in this day and age.

1084
01:21:17,247 --> 01:21:19,181
What's not easy?

1085
01:21:20,417 --> 01:21:23,079
- Meeting people.
- Oh, God, tell me about it!

1086
01:21:23,153 --> 01:21:26,020
I've been dating longer
than I've been driving.

1087
01:21:26,089 --> 01:21:27,750
I can't believe that.

1088
01:21:29,893 --> 01:21:34,830
I have never been through
a dating period.

1089
01:21:34,898 --> 01:21:37,628
It's a disgusting process.

1090
01:21:37,700 --> 01:21:40,328
You haven't missed a thing.

1091
01:21:40,403 --> 01:21:43,702
- Hold still.
- I'm so excited.

1092
01:21:46,209 --> 01:21:48,871
Did you feel like this
when you first met Anne?

1093
01:21:48,945 --> 01:21:51,846
Because she's a wonderful woman.
She loves you too much, Jack.

1094
01:21:51,915 --> 01:21:55,316
But you love her, too, don't you?

1095
01:21:55,385 --> 01:21:59,151
You know you do. It's just that you're
a little bit of an asshole sometimes.

1096
01:21:59,222 --> 01:22:00,655
Sorry.

1097
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:04,893
Thanks.

1098
01:22:06,629 --> 01:22:10,963
My mother calls once a week
like an ongoing nightmare.

1099
01:22:11,034 --> 01:22:13,025
"Have you met anyone?"
"No, Mom."

1100
01:22:13,102 --> 01:22:16,037
"What's going to happen?"
"I don't know, Mom."

1101
01:22:16,105 --> 01:22:18,835
Thank God I moved out of that house.

1102
01:22:18,908 --> 01:22:21,934
I cannot believe you lived with her
as long as you did.

1103
01:22:22,011 --> 01:22:25,378
It I had to live with my mother,
I would stab myself six times.

1104
01:22:28,685 --> 01:22:31,654
I think some people
are meant to be alone.

1105
01:22:32,889 --> 01:22:37,292
This is my idea, that I was born a man
in a former life...

1106
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:40,454
and I used women for pleasure...

1107
01:22:40,530 --> 01:22:42,691
so now...

1108
01:22:42,765 --> 01:22:44,733
I'm paying for it.

1109
01:22:45,702 --> 01:22:50,002
I wouldn't mind so much it I could
just remember the pleasure parts.

1110
01:22:51,241 --> 01:22:54,733
I think you're getting
a little too complicated.

1111
01:22:54,811 --> 01:22:58,838
What, in your opinion,
is the actual problem?

1112
01:22:58,915 --> 01:23:01,509
I don't make an impression on people.

1113
01:23:02,986 --> 01:23:07,320
At office parties,
I rearrange the hors d'oeuvres...

1114
01:23:07,390 --> 01:23:11,690
while people are eating them
so the platters will remain full.

1115
01:23:11,761 --> 01:23:16,164
I never start any of the conversations
because I just don't know--

1116
01:23:18,201 --> 01:23:21,432
I don't know where
to make it end, to go.

1117
01:23:21,504 --> 01:23:26,373
Listen. You've got to be
a little easier on yourself, doll.

1118
01:23:26,442 --> 01:23:30,378
A conversation
has a life of its own.

1119
01:23:30,446 --> 01:23:33,040
You have to have some faith
in that fact.

1120
01:23:33,116 --> 01:23:35,311
I mean, look at us.

1121
01:23:35,385 --> 01:23:37,319
We're having...

1122
01:23:38,655 --> 01:23:41,089
a very lovely conversation.

1123
01:23:41,157 --> 01:23:42,749
I'm paying you.

1124
01:23:42,825 --> 01:23:45,885
Will you stop it? I'm not like that!
I don't do people favors.

1125
01:23:47,363 --> 01:23:49,923
It I talk to you, it's because
I want to talk to you.

1126
01:23:49,999 --> 01:23:52,832
All right, you're not a super model.
We can't all be Jerry Hall.

1127
01:23:52,902 --> 01:23:56,269
What a boring world
it we were all Jerry Hall.

1128
01:23:56,339 --> 01:23:58,899
You do the best you can
with what you got.

1129
01:23:58,975 --> 01:24:01,102
You're not so invisible.

1130
01:24:01,177 --> 01:24:03,441
Hey, you want a personality?

1131
01:24:03,513 --> 01:24:05,504
Try this on for size.

1132
01:24:05,582 --> 01:24:08,608
You can be a real bitch.

1133
01:24:16,859 --> 01:24:18,986
- Really?
- Yeah.

1134
01:24:32,575 --> 01:24:36,534
I'm going to give you my wallet
so you can pay for dinner.

1135
01:24:36,613 --> 01:24:39,411
You're a nice man, Jack,
doing all this for me.

1136
01:24:41,718 --> 01:24:43,777
- I'm scared.
- No, no, no.

1137
01:24:43,853 --> 01:24:46,083
I feel so much for her.

1138
01:24:46,155 --> 01:24:48,248
I feel like something
awful's going to happen.

1139
01:24:48,324 --> 01:24:51,157
Nothing awful is going to happen.

1140
01:24:51,227 --> 01:24:53,718
Anne is going to be there.
I'm gonna be there.

1141
01:24:53,796 --> 01:24:56,959
Nothing awful's going to happen. Okay?

1142
01:24:57,033 --> 01:24:59,763
- I'm still scared.
- I know. It's going to be fine.

1143
01:24:59,836 --> 01:25:01,804
Okay. All right.

1144
01:25:01,871 --> 01:25:05,363
You're looking good.
Just remember to breathe.

1145
01:25:05,441 --> 01:25:07,534
- Okay, I gotta breathe.
- Big breath.

1146
01:25:19,489 --> 01:25:21,855
Oh, please, no, stay.

1147
01:25:21,924 --> 01:25:25,485
- Look. It's Lydia Sinclair, our winner.
- I know.

1148
01:25:25,561 --> 01:25:27,722
What have you fellas been up to?

1149
01:25:27,797 --> 01:25:31,460
We thought we'd get some dinner.

1150
01:25:35,605 --> 01:25:37,903
Say, anybody up for Chinese?

1151
01:25:37,974 --> 01:25:40,841
Hmm? Have you eaten?
Would you like to join us?

1152
01:25:40,910 --> 01:25:44,607
No, thank you.
I'd rather go home.

1153
01:25:44,681 --> 01:25:47,707
- Me, too.
- Parry, come on.

1154
01:25:47,784 --> 01:25:50,582
- You have to eat.
- I'd like to go now.

1155
01:25:50,653 --> 01:25:53,451
Don't blow this.

1156
01:25:53,523 --> 01:25:56,356
- I'd rather go home.
- It's only dinner.

1157
01:25:56,426 --> 01:25:58,951
Come on.
You're gonna do this.

1158
01:25:59,028 --> 01:26:02,395
You'll have something to tell
your mother the next time she calls.

1159
01:26:02,465 --> 01:26:04,399
You are coming!

1160
01:26:05,868 --> 01:26:07,768
Fine.

1161
01:26:11,674 --> 01:26:14,006
What do you do?

1162
01:26:14,077 --> 01:26:18,070
I get to read the books sometimes.

1163
01:26:18,147 --> 01:26:22,413
But mostly I calculate
production costs...

1164
01:26:22,485 --> 01:26:24,419
from--

1165
01:26:24,487 --> 01:26:27,422
Calculation costs from...

1166
01:26:27,490 --> 01:26:31,119
first-edition hardcover to,
sorry, softcover.

1167
01:26:31,194 --> 01:26:34,220
And after softcover, it's basically
somebody else's problem.

1168
01:26:34,297 --> 01:26:36,595
That sounds real exciting.

1169
01:26:36,666 --> 01:26:39,499
It's not exciting at all.

1170
01:26:39,569 --> 01:26:41,298
Why not?

1171
01:26:41,370 --> 01:26:46,808
I mean, your calculations determine
whether a book is published or not.

1172
01:26:46,876 --> 01:26:51,472
Maybe it's a book that changes the way
people think or act.

1173
01:26:52,348 --> 01:26:56,409
But what we publish
is mostly trashy romance novels.

1174
01:26:56,486 --> 01:26:58,078
Don't say that.

1175
01:26:58,154 --> 01:27:00,884
There's nothing trashy
about romance.

1176
01:27:02,358 --> 01:27:05,623
In romance, there's passion...

1177
01:27:05,695 --> 01:27:08,220
there's imagination...

1178
01:27:08,297 --> 01:27:09,992
there's beauty.

1179
01:27:11,934 --> 01:27:13,367
Besides...

1180
01:27:13,436 --> 01:27:16,371
you find some wonderful things
in the trash.

1181
01:27:29,418 --> 01:27:32,512
Oh, dumplings.
I could eat all of these.

1182
01:27:34,257 --> 01:27:36,521
Lydia, would you like a dumpling?

1183
01:27:37,527 --> 01:27:39,825
- Some tea?
- Yes, please.

1184
01:28:01,951 --> 01:28:04,112
Oh, boy. Sorry.

1185
01:28:13,763 --> 01:28:15,663
Sorry.

1186
01:28:24,607 --> 01:28:26,040
It's hot.

1187
01:28:39,021 --> 01:28:41,251
Help her with that.

1188
01:29:03,646 --> 01:29:05,637
What do you think?

1189
01:29:08,784 --> 01:29:11,810
I think that they were made
for each other.

1190
01:29:12,889 --> 01:29:15,289
It's scary, but true.

1191
01:29:19,028 --> 01:29:21,690
I got it. You got it.

1192
01:29:21,764 --> 01:29:24,232
There it is. Okay.

1193
01:29:46,322 --> 01:29:49,416
Oh, Lydia, oh, Lydia
Say, have you met Lydia

1194
01:29:49,492 --> 01:29:51,983
Lydia, the tattooed lady

1195
01:29:52,061 --> 01:29:54,495
She has eyes that men adore so

1196
01:29:54,563 --> 01:29:57,361
And a torso even more so

1197
01:29:57,433 --> 01:30:00,334
Oh, Lydia, oh, Lydia
Say, have you met Lydia

1198
01:30:00,403 --> 01:30:03,236
Lydia, the Queen of Tattoos

1199
01:30:03,306 --> 01:30:06,400
On her back
is the Battle of Waterloo

1200
01:30:06,475 --> 01:30:09,308
The sight at the wreck
of the "Hesperus" too

1201
01:30:09,378 --> 01:30:13,075
And proudly above waves
the red, white and blue

1202
01:30:13,149 --> 01:30:16,380
You can learn a lot from Lydia

1203
01:30:22,892 --> 01:30:25,884
When her robe is unfurled
she will show you the world

1204
01:30:25,962 --> 01:30:28,726
If you step up and tell her where

1205
01:30:28,798 --> 01:30:31,858
For a dime, you can see
Kankakee or Paris

1206
01:30:31,934 --> 01:30:34,630
Or Washington crossing the Delaware

1207
01:30:47,183 --> 01:30:50,016
When her muscles start relaxing

1208
01:30:50,086 --> 01:30:53,146
Up the hill comes Michael Jackson

1209
01:30:59,929 --> 01:31:03,057
Did you see her with the noodles?

1210
01:31:03,132 --> 01:31:07,592
She had a noodle
hanging down her head.

1211
01:31:07,670 --> 01:31:10,036
I couldn't believe it.

1212
01:31:11,907 --> 01:31:13,465
Come on.

1213
01:31:13,542 --> 01:31:15,908
And then they started in
on the dumplings.

1214
01:31:15,978 --> 01:31:18,606
They were playing hockey
with the dumpling on the table.

1215
01:31:18,681 --> 01:31:22,412
- It was broccoli.
- No, it was a dumpling.

1216
01:31:22,485 --> 01:31:26,387
They were batting it around
with a chopstick.

1217
01:31:26,455 --> 01:31:28,855
Stop or I'll lose it right here.

1218
01:31:33,629 --> 01:31:36,689
- Yo, Lydia!
- Watch out.

1219
01:31:39,902 --> 01:31:43,235
Tell me more about yourself.
I'd like to know everything.

1220
01:31:43,305 --> 01:31:46,832
- There's nothing more to tell.
- Don't say that.

1221
01:31:46,909 --> 01:31:49,707
- No, that's it.
- It's enough for me.

1222
01:31:49,779 --> 01:31:54,648
- I really think she went for him.
- I know. I can't believe I did it.

1223
01:31:56,919 --> 01:31:58,352
What?

1224
01:31:58,421 --> 01:32:00,355
It's Latin.

1225
01:32:00,423 --> 01:32:02,823
It means "Love conquers all."

1226
01:32:02,892 --> 01:32:04,860
I don't mean us.

1227
01:32:04,927 --> 01:32:06,861
I mean everybody else.

1228
01:32:08,798 --> 01:32:12,165
- You think it'll work out?
- Who knows?

1229
01:32:12,234 --> 01:32:16,398
Two people could be at a party together
and never find each other.

1230
01:32:16,472 --> 01:32:19,635
Another two people could be
on opposite sides of the world...

1231
01:32:19,708 --> 01:32:23,735
and nothing could keep them apart.

1232
01:32:23,813 --> 01:32:27,271
The thing is, if a thing
is meant to happen--

1233
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:32,982
What?

1234
01:32:33,055 --> 01:32:36,286
- Nothing. Go on.
- Wait a minute.

1235
01:32:37,426 --> 01:32:40,122
You must be very proud
of yourself.

1236
01:32:41,097 --> 01:32:44,066
You did a great thing
for somebody tonight.

1237
01:32:46,769 --> 01:32:49,829
I was very proud
to be with you tonight.

1238
01:32:51,107 --> 01:32:53,075
You were great.

1239
01:32:54,443 --> 01:32:55,876
Thank you.

1240
01:33:08,557 --> 01:33:10,218
You're welcome.

1241
01:33:17,333 --> 01:33:19,164
Steamed dumplings!

1242
01:33:20,436 --> 01:33:22,370
Mu shu pork!

1243
01:33:24,573 --> 01:33:24,607
You don't have to say that.

1244
01:33:24,607 --> 01:33:27,075
You don't have to say that.

1245
01:33:27,143 --> 01:33:29,077
I never say anything I have to.

1246
01:33:29,145 --> 01:33:33,104
I mean, you don't have to say
nice things to me.

1247
01:33:33,182 --> 01:33:36,208
It's a little old-fashioned
considering what we're about to do.

1248
01:33:36,285 --> 01:33:39,777
- What are we about to do?
- You're walking me home.

1249
01:33:41,290 --> 01:33:44,726
- I think you're attracted to me.
- Yeah.

1250
01:33:44,793 --> 01:33:46,226
And...

1251
01:33:50,032 --> 01:33:53,524
you'll probably want to come upstairs
for some coffee.

1252
01:33:53,602 --> 01:33:55,536
I don't drink coffee.

1253
01:33:55,604 --> 01:33:58,471
And we'll probably
have a drink and talk...

1254
01:33:58,541 --> 01:34:02,500
and get to know each other better,
get comfortable.

1255
01:34:02,578 --> 01:34:04,603
Then you'll--

1256
01:34:10,386 --> 01:34:12,946
You'll sleep over.

1257
01:34:13,022 --> 01:34:16,082
And in the morning,
you'll awake...

1258
01:34:16,158 --> 01:34:18,149
and you'll be distant.

1259
01:34:19,428 --> 01:34:22,886
And you won't be able
to stay for breakfast.

1260
01:34:22,965 --> 01:34:24,990
Maybe just a cup of coffee.

1261
01:34:25,067 --> 01:34:27,001
I don't drink coffee.

1262
01:34:27,069 --> 01:34:30,971
Then we'll exchange phone numbers...

1263
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:33,372
and you'll leave...

1264
01:34:35,411 --> 01:34:37,606
and never call.

1265
01:34:38,847 --> 01:34:43,580
I'll go to work and I'll feel
so good for the first hour...

1266
01:34:43,652 --> 01:34:49,215
and then, ever so slowly,
I'll turn into a piece of dirt.

1267
01:34:55,030 --> 01:34:58,796
I don't know why
I'm putting myself through this.

1268
01:35:04,707 --> 01:35:07,267
It was really nice to meet you.

1269
01:35:09,478 --> 01:35:11,036
Night.

1270
01:35:14,683 --> 01:35:17,083
Excuse me! Wait. Just--

1271
01:35:18,254 --> 01:35:21,189
Sorry. Wait one minute.
Excuse me. Please wait.

1272
01:35:21,257 --> 01:35:24,192
- Wait.
- I'm not feeling very well.

1273
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:29,197
No wonder. We just met, made love
and broke up in 30 seconds.

1274
01:35:29,265 --> 01:35:32,701
And I don't remember the first kiss
which I think is the best part.

1275
01:35:32,768 --> 01:35:34,895
It was so special to meet you--

1276
01:35:34,970 --> 01:35:38,929
It was for me, too. But I think
it's time you should shut up now.

1277
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:41,806
Shut up, please?

1278
01:35:45,514 --> 01:35:49,610
I'm not coming up to your apartment.
That was never my intention.

1279
01:35:49,685 --> 01:35:53,883
- Oh, God! You don't want to.
- Oh, no, I want to!

1280
01:35:53,956 --> 01:35:57,653
I have a hard-on for you
the size of Florida.

1281
01:35:59,061 --> 01:36:01,859
But I don't want just one night.

1282
01:36:03,899 --> 01:36:06,732
I have a confession
I have to make to you.

1283
01:36:06,802 --> 01:36:08,030
You're married?

1284
01:36:08,103 --> 01:36:09,934
You're divorced?

1285
01:36:10,005 --> 01:36:12,235
- You have a disease?
- No. Please, stop.

1286
01:36:15,911 --> 01:36:17,902
I'm in love with you.

1287
01:36:23,919 --> 01:36:25,944
Not just from tonight.

1288
01:36:26,021 --> 01:36:28,353
I've known you for a long time.

1289
01:36:30,359 --> 01:36:34,318
I know you come from work at noon,
you fight your way out that door...

1290
01:36:34,396 --> 01:36:37,627
get pushed back in and three
seconds later, come back out again.

1291
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:43,434
I know it it's a good day if you get
that romance novel at that bookstore.

1292
01:36:43,505 --> 01:36:47,441
I know what you order. On Wednesdays
you go to that dim sum parlor.

1293
01:36:47,509 --> 01:36:51,809
I know that you get a jawbreaker
before you go back in to work.

1294
01:36:53,749 --> 01:36:58,015
And I know you hate your job
and don't have many friends.

1295
01:36:58,087 --> 01:37:00,920
I know sometimes you feel
a little uncoordinated.

1296
01:37:00,989 --> 01:37:04,720
You don't feel as wonderful
as everybody else...

1297
01:37:04,793 --> 01:37:08,194
feeling as alone and separate
as you feel you are.

1298
01:37:09,565 --> 01:37:11,533
I love you.

1299
01:37:18,107 --> 01:37:21,508
And I think you're the greatest thing
since spice racks.

1300
01:37:21,577 --> 01:37:24,876
I'd be knocked out
if I could have that first kiss.

1301
01:37:24,947 --> 01:37:27,575
And I won't be distant.

1302
01:37:27,649 --> 01:37:31,551
I'll come back in the morning
and I'll call you it you let me.

1303
01:37:33,222 --> 01:37:35,554
But I still don't drink coffee.

1304
01:37:53,075 --> 01:37:54,633
You're real...

1305
01:37:57,212 --> 01:37:58,770
aren't you?

1306
01:38:12,628 --> 01:38:14,619
It's the wrong door.

1307
01:38:18,901 --> 01:38:21,267
You can call me.

1308
01:38:26,408 --> 01:38:29,241
She didn't give me the number.

1309
01:39:20,596 --> 01:39:23,759
Please let me have this.

1310
01:39:29,505 --> 01:39:31,735
Let me have it!

1311
01:41:27,489 --> 01:41:29,423
Where are you?

1312
01:41:43,805 --> 01:41:47,002
We're tired of looking at you people!

1313
01:42:02,624 --> 01:42:04,649
Thank you.

1314
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,025
Yeah, well, I'm feeling good.

1315
01:42:14,102 --> 01:42:16,593
I don't know how else to put it.

1316
01:42:17,673 --> 01:42:21,871
Yeah, well, I had those personal
problems to work out, and I have.

1317
01:42:21,943 --> 01:42:24,639
And now I want to get back to work.

1318
01:42:24,713 --> 01:42:26,704
You think that's possible?

1319
01:42:28,450 --> 01:42:30,418
Yeah, I understand.

1320
01:42:32,220 --> 01:42:34,313
I am. Yeah.

1321
01:42:35,624 --> 01:42:37,114
I won't.

1322
01:42:38,727 --> 01:42:40,456
I will.

1323
01:42:43,699 --> 01:42:45,326
Great. When?

1324
01:42:47,135 --> 01:42:50,127
Tuesday is tine.
Tuesday is great, Lou.

1325
01:42:50,205 --> 01:42:52,901
All right. I'll see you then.
Thanks a lot.

1326
01:42:52,974 --> 01:42:54,908
Okay. Bye.

1327
01:42:54,976 --> 01:42:57,604
- Who's Lou?
- Lou is my agent.

1328
01:42:57,679 --> 01:42:59,647
- You're kidding.
- I called my agent.

1329
01:42:59,715 --> 01:43:01,842
What did he say?

1330
01:43:01,917 --> 01:43:05,250
He says if I want to get back to work,
no problem.

1331
01:43:05,320 --> 01:43:10,189
That I just come in,
and we talk and that's it.

1332
01:43:11,993 --> 01:43:14,689
Baby, that's terrific!

1333
01:43:14,763 --> 01:43:17,391
I gotta get these tapes organized.
You seen my jacket?

1334
01:43:17,466 --> 01:43:19,661
It's in the bathroom.

1335
01:43:19,735 --> 01:43:21,930
I got the coffee here
if you want it.

1336
01:43:22,003 --> 01:43:23,698
You made coffee?

1337
01:43:23,772 --> 01:43:27,503
You are going back to work,
and you made coffee?

1338
01:43:27,576 --> 01:43:29,771
I'm loving this!

1339
01:43:33,381 --> 01:43:35,815
You know what would be neat?

1340
01:43:35,884 --> 01:43:39,320
Now that there's going to be
another income coming in...

1341
01:43:39,387 --> 01:43:41,617
I would love to look
for a bigger place.

1342
01:43:41,690 --> 01:43:46,787
I don't want to rush anything,
but I'd like to start looking anyway.

1343
01:43:46,862 --> 01:43:48,796
Maybe a two-bedroom?

1344
01:43:48,864 --> 01:43:52,356
Or maybe even the top floor
of a house?

1345
01:43:52,434 --> 01:43:55,096
Say, in Brooklyn Heights?

1346
01:43:58,507 --> 01:44:00,031
What?

1347
01:44:00,108 --> 01:44:03,236
You don't want to commute, right?
That's all right.

1348
01:44:03,311 --> 01:44:04,744
Come here.

1349
01:44:05,647 --> 01:44:08,616
You are an incredible woman.

1350
01:44:08,683 --> 01:44:10,844
- I'm an incredible woman?
- Yeah.

1351
01:44:10,919 --> 01:44:15,219
- What's this, a death sentence?
- No. I want to talk about this.

1352
01:44:16,324 --> 01:44:19,225
So much has happened...

1353
01:44:19,294 --> 01:44:23,060
that I think it would be a good thing
for both of us...

1354
01:44:23,131 --> 01:44:25,725
it we...

1355
01:44:25,801 --> 01:44:28,201
slowed down a little.

1356
01:44:28,270 --> 01:44:30,864
Slowed down? Where have I been?
Have we been going fast here?

1357
01:44:30,939 --> 01:44:36,275
Anne, this has been a real
difficult time for me this past year.

1358
01:44:36,344 --> 01:44:37,777
Yeah?

1359
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:42,475
And I feel like I'm above water
for the first time.

1360
01:44:42,551 --> 01:44:46,112
I know a lot more now, and I don't want
to make any more mistakes.

1361
01:44:46,188 --> 01:44:51,148
- So?
- I need time to make the right choices.

1362
01:44:51,226 --> 01:44:53,956
Wait, wait.
What are you saying?

1363
01:44:54,029 --> 01:44:57,260
I think maybe I should be alone
for a while.

1364
01:44:59,935 --> 01:45:04,133
Now that I know more, you know,
I feel that...

1365
01:45:05,774 --> 01:45:09,301
I should focus on my career
now that everything's taken care of.

1366
01:45:09,377 --> 01:45:10,639
Parry's--

1367
01:45:10,712 --> 01:45:14,079
Let me just say one thing, okay?

1368
01:45:14,149 --> 01:45:17,949
You don't know shit, okay?

1369
01:45:18,019 --> 01:45:21,113
Secondly, as far as we go...

1370
01:45:21,189 --> 01:45:24,352
what have we been doing here
except time?

1371
01:45:24,426 --> 01:45:27,520
Have I ever pressured you?
Once ever?

1372
01:45:29,531 --> 01:45:32,500
So what time do you need, baby?

1373
01:45:32,567 --> 01:45:35,365
I love you.
You love me.

1374
01:45:35,437 --> 01:45:38,804
You want to get your career going?
That's the greatest thing in the world.

1375
01:45:38,874 --> 01:45:42,332
I want to be there when it happens.

1376
01:45:43,411 --> 01:45:46,642
So what do you need time to figure out?

1377
01:45:49,517 --> 01:45:53,647
Let me just ask you one thing.

1378
01:45:54,856 --> 01:45:56,790
Do you love me?

1379
01:45:58,860 --> 01:46:00,794
I don't know.

1380
01:46:04,666 --> 01:46:07,260
You can't even give me that,
can you?

1381
01:46:08,303 --> 01:46:11,670
Jesus, Jack!
What were you planning on doing here?

1382
01:46:11,740 --> 01:46:13,833
Were you planning on packing up...

1383
01:46:13,909 --> 01:46:16,036
and dropping me a note
when you meet somebody new?

1384
01:46:16,111 --> 01:46:19,239
I had no idea.
I just said I need time.

1385
01:46:19,314 --> 01:46:20,747
Bullshit!

1386
01:46:20,815 --> 01:46:23,943
It you're going to hurt me, hurt me now,
not some drawn-out hurt...

1387
01:46:24,019 --> 01:46:28,149
that takes months of my life
because you don't have the balls!

1388
01:46:30,558 --> 01:46:33,186
Okay, I'll pack my stuff tonight.

1389
01:46:34,262 --> 01:46:39,427
What have you been doing here?
Could you just tell me that?

1390
01:46:39,501 --> 01:46:42,163
- We both got something.
- What did I get?

1391
01:46:42,237 --> 01:46:44,705
What did I get...

1392
01:46:44,773 --> 01:46:49,335
I couldn't have gotten from anybody
with no name any night of the week?

1393
01:46:49,411 --> 01:46:51,879
Do you think your company
is such a treat?

1394
01:46:51,947 --> 01:46:56,281
Your moods, your pain, your problems.
You think this has been entertaining?

1395
01:46:56,351 --> 01:46:58,410
What do you want to stay with me for?

1396
01:47:01,323 --> 01:47:04,554
Because I love you.

1397
01:47:06,661 --> 01:47:09,289
You stupid tucking--

1398
01:47:29,284 --> 01:47:31,218
No, stop it. Stop, stop.

1399
01:47:31,286 --> 01:47:34,255
Don't. No.
You don't get to be nice!

1400
01:47:35,690 --> 01:47:39,319
I'm not going to play some stupid game
where we act like friends...

1401
01:47:39,394 --> 01:47:42,659
so you get to walk out
feeling good about yourself.

1402
01:47:42,731 --> 01:47:44,961
I'm not a modern woman.

1403
01:47:45,033 --> 01:47:49,470
If this is over,
let's just call it over.

1404
01:48:13,428 --> 01:48:14,861
Yeah?

1405
01:48:18,967 --> 01:48:21,435
My wallet?
What do you mean?

1406
01:48:38,520 --> 01:48:39,953
Parry.

1407
01:48:44,359 --> 01:48:47,385
He can't hear you.

1408
01:48:47,462 --> 01:48:50,920
I'm Dr. Mandeville.
I was on duty when they brought him in.

1409
01:48:52,767 --> 01:48:55,998
I've been going over his record.
He was in once before.

1410
01:48:56,071 --> 01:48:59,905
Catatonic stupor.
Condition rendered him non-verbal.

1411
01:48:59,974 --> 01:49:04,240
Yeah? So the guy, he's been beat up.
He's got a concussion, right?

1412
01:49:04,312 --> 01:49:07,406
Right?
He's gonna snap out of it.

1413
01:49:07,482 --> 01:49:09,416
I'm afraid not.

1414
01:49:09,484 --> 01:49:12,715
See, the beating's bad,
but it's not the problem.

1415
01:49:12,787 --> 01:49:15,221
He seems to be reexperiencing
the catatonia.

1416
01:49:15,290 --> 01:49:17,690
Like before, he could
snap out of it in an hour...

1417
01:49:17,759 --> 01:49:20,489
or 13 months, 13 years.

1418
01:49:23,965 --> 01:49:26,024
There's no way to be sure.

1419
01:49:28,570 --> 01:49:32,028
A person could actually reexperience
the full effect of a tragedy...

1420
01:49:32,107 --> 01:49:34,871
long after the event took place.

1421
01:49:34,943 --> 01:49:37,776
I was reading how he lost his wife.

1422
01:49:37,846 --> 01:49:39,746
Are you relatives?

1423
01:49:40,982 --> 01:49:44,008
Well, it doesn't matter.
We'll take care of him.

1424
01:49:44,085 --> 01:49:47,179
He'll have to be sent back
to the same institution.

1425
01:49:49,124 --> 01:49:51,183
What if I was a relative?

1426
01:49:51,259 --> 01:49:54,387
You'd have the option
to care for him at home...

1427
01:49:54,462 --> 01:49:57,226
but I wouldn't recommend it.

1428
01:49:57,298 --> 01:50:01,029
It wouldn't be good for him.
He needs hospital care.

1429
01:50:01,102 --> 01:50:04,469
I just thought you could sign the
release forms, but the city can do that.

1430
01:50:06,174 --> 01:50:08,540
I'm sorry.

1431
01:50:13,214 --> 01:50:15,182
Poor Lydia.

1432
01:50:15,250 --> 01:50:19,084
She finally finds her prince,
and he falls into a coma.

1433
01:50:20,021 --> 01:50:22,956
Some women have no luck.

1434
01:50:44,145 --> 01:50:46,204
I'll call you, okay?

1435
01:50:50,585 --> 01:50:53,816
The answer: two dwarves and a melon.

1436
01:50:53,888 --> 01:50:55,913
Well, I'm out of here.
Have a perfect weekend.

1437
01:50:55,990 --> 01:50:59,448
And remember, on Monday we have as
our special studio guest, Ben Starr...

1438
01:50:59,527 --> 01:51:03,588
star of the recently defunct
hit TV show "On the Radio."

1439
01:51:03,665 --> 01:51:07,328
So, from one of the botched
to you bungled cats out there...

1440
01:51:07,402 --> 01:51:10,394
I love you,
and right back at you.

1441
01:51:16,644 --> 01:51:18,077
Yeah.

1442
01:51:18,146 --> 01:51:21,946
Lou, look, I said I want an otter
or they can forget it.

1443
01:51:23,918 --> 01:51:27,445
You tell them I'm talking
to the cable people about a talk show.

1444
01:51:27,522 --> 01:51:28,955
What?

1445
01:51:30,225 --> 01:51:34,321
Beth's father set it up.
No, he owns it.

1446
01:51:53,681 --> 01:51:56,275
- You gotta get outta here.
- I'm not bothering anybody.

1447
01:51:56,351 --> 01:51:59,479
You gotta move it.
Come on, let's go.

1448
01:51:59,554 --> 01:52:02,580
Jack, it's me!

1449
01:52:02,657 --> 01:52:04,591
Stop it.
I know that guy.

1450
01:52:06,027 --> 01:52:09,861
Remember me? Venice!
You know me.

1451
01:52:09,931 --> 01:52:12,525
Please, can I talk to you?

1452
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:17,060
I need to talk.
We spent time together. Please!

1453
01:52:18,506 --> 01:52:20,838
You know this guy?

1454
01:52:20,908 --> 01:52:24,503
Why won't you talk to me?
Leave me alone!

1455
01:52:24,579 --> 01:52:26,706
Why?

1456
01:52:28,950 --> 01:52:33,614
It's a weekly comedy about the homeless,
but it's not depressing in any way.

1457
01:52:33,688 --> 01:52:36,623
We want to find a funny, upbeat way...

1458
01:52:36,691 --> 01:52:39,558
of bringing the issue
of homelessness to television.

1459
01:52:39,627 --> 01:52:44,223
So, we've got three wacky
homeless characters.

1460
01:52:44,299 --> 01:52:47,166
But they're wise.
They're wacky and wise.

1461
01:52:47,235 --> 01:52:49,430
And the hook is they love
being homeless.

1462
01:52:49,504 --> 01:52:51,802
They love the freedom,
the adventure.

1463
01:52:51,873 --> 01:52:54,433
It's all about the joy of living,
not the bullshit we deal with...

1464
01:52:54,509 --> 01:52:56,443
the money, the politics.

1465
01:52:56,511 --> 01:53:00,106
And the best part is,
it's called "Home Free."

1466
01:53:01,449 --> 01:53:03,917
I'm getting a rush.

1467
01:53:08,022 --> 01:53:10,547
What is this,
another disappearing act?

1468
01:53:10,625 --> 01:53:13,958
It's not a problem.
It's a bathroom break.

1469
01:53:14,028 --> 01:53:15,461
I'll check.

1470
01:53:28,810 --> 01:53:30,243
Shit!

1471
01:53:37,819 --> 01:53:39,650
- Parry.
- Damn.

1472
01:53:39,721 --> 01:53:43,179
What?

1473
01:53:43,257 --> 01:53:45,350
It's a grail!

1474
01:53:45,426 --> 01:53:48,486
The Holy Grail.

1475
01:53:48,563 --> 01:53:50,827
The Holy--

1476
01:53:50,898 --> 01:53:55,699
Some billionaire has got the Holy Grail
in his library on Fifth Avenue?

1477
01:53:55,770 --> 01:53:59,797
Exactly. Who'd think you'd find
anything divine on the upper East Side?

1478
01:54:03,444 --> 01:54:06,675
They said you're the one.

1479
01:54:48,456 --> 01:54:50,447
Henry Sagan?

1480
01:55:04,472 --> 01:55:06,030
Pardon me.

1481
01:55:06,107 --> 01:55:08,803
Not long ago,
I left some new sheets for Parry.

1482
01:55:08,876 --> 01:55:12,710
They were lime-colored,
like this color, with watermelons.

1483
01:55:12,780 --> 01:55:15,840
Oh, yes.
I'm sorry, they're being cleaned.

1484
01:55:15,917 --> 01:55:18,750
The doctor had an accident
with the hypo.

1485
01:55:18,820 --> 01:55:23,189
That's all right. Just make sure
he does get them when they are cleaned.

1486
01:55:45,813 --> 01:55:48,213
Hi. It's Jack.

1487
01:55:51,452 --> 01:55:53,852
How are you doing?
You're looking good.

1488
01:55:53,921 --> 01:55:55,752
Yes, you do.

1489
01:56:05,533 --> 01:56:07,831
You going to wake up for me?

1490
01:56:24,752 --> 01:56:26,686
This isn't over, is it?

1491
01:56:28,956 --> 01:56:31,948
You think you're going
to make me do this, don't you?

1492
01:56:32,026 --> 01:56:34,494
Forget it.
No tucking way.

1493
01:56:34,562 --> 01:56:37,827
I don't feel responsible
for you or anybody.

1494
01:56:37,899 --> 01:56:41,665
Everybody's got bad things
that happen to them. I'm not God!

1495
01:56:41,736 --> 01:56:43,704
I don't decide--

1496
01:56:45,273 --> 01:56:46,968
People survive.

1497
01:56:51,412 --> 01:56:53,346
Say something!

1498
01:57:04,425 --> 01:57:07,917
Everything's been going great.
Great.

1499
01:57:09,497 --> 01:57:13,524
I'm going to have
my own cable talk show...

1500
01:57:13,601 --> 01:57:15,967
with an incredible equity,
I might add.

1501
01:57:17,004 --> 01:57:21,304
I've got an incredible incredibly
fucking gorgeous girlfriend.

1502
01:57:21,375 --> 01:57:25,835
I'm living an incredible
tucking life.

1503
01:57:25,913 --> 01:57:28,711
So don't lay there
in your comfortable coma...

1504
01:57:28,783 --> 01:57:32,549
and think I'm going to risk all that
because I feel responsible for you.

1505
01:57:32,620 --> 01:57:34,952
I'm not responsible!

1506
01:57:37,091 --> 01:57:39,116
I don't feel guilty.
You've got it easy.

1507
01:57:39,193 --> 01:57:43,095
I'm out there every day,
every tucking day...

1508
01:57:43,164 --> 01:57:46,133
trying to figure out
what the hell I'm doing.

1509
01:57:46,200 --> 01:57:49,795
Why no matter what I have,
it feels like I have nothing.

1510
01:57:51,205 --> 01:57:53,799
So I don't feel sorry for you.
It's easy being nuts.

1511
01:57:53,874 --> 01:57:55,899
Try being me!

1512
01:58:00,381 --> 01:58:03,817
So I won't do it.
I don't believe in this shit.

1513
01:58:07,121 --> 01:58:09,988
Don't give me that stuff
about me being the one.

1514
01:58:10,057 --> 01:58:11,820
There's nothing...

1515
01:58:11,892 --> 01:58:14,759
nothing special about me.

1516
01:58:15,997 --> 01:58:19,489
I control my own destiny,
not some...

1517
01:58:19,567 --> 01:58:22,559
floating overweight fairies.

1518
01:58:22,637 --> 01:58:25,902
I decide what I'm going to do,
and I'm not going to risk my life...

1519
01:58:25,973 --> 01:58:29,602
to get some fucking cup
for some tucking vegetable!

1520
01:58:29,677 --> 01:58:30,939
You motherfucker!

1521
01:58:31,012 --> 01:58:33,446
What am I supposed to do?

1522
01:58:44,992 --> 01:58:46,425
Cup.

1523
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:57,562
All right. For the sake of argument,
let's say I do do this.

1524
01:58:57,638 --> 01:59:00,402
It I do this...

1525
01:59:00,474 --> 01:59:04,501
I want you to know it wouldn't be
because I felt I had to...

1526
01:59:04,578 --> 01:59:08,139
or because I felt cursed
or guilty or responsible.

1527
01:59:08,215 --> 01:59:10,149
It I do this--

1528
01:59:20,261 --> 01:59:22,661
It I do this...

1529
01:59:22,730 --> 01:59:24,823
and I mean if...

1530
01:59:26,934 --> 01:59:30,700
it's because
I want to do this for you.

1531
01:59:30,771 --> 01:59:32,762
That's all.

1532
01:59:33,641 --> 01:59:35,666
For you.

1533
01:59:43,217 --> 01:59:45,549
Don't go anywhere.

1534
02:00:04,405 --> 02:00:05,838
Shit!

1535
02:00:45,112 --> 02:00:46,545
Great.

1536
02:00:49,450 --> 02:00:53,045
I'm hearing horses now.
Parry will be so pleased.

1537
02:00:54,421 --> 02:00:57,515
Radio personality turns screwball
on mission from God.

1538
02:00:59,493 --> 02:01:04,021
I just hope when they put me away,
they find me a place right next to his.

1539
02:01:50,644 --> 02:01:52,407
Fuck!

1540
02:02:07,795 --> 02:02:10,355
Thank God nobody looks up
in this town.

1541
02:02:38,759 --> 02:02:40,192
Shit.

1542
02:02:41,295 --> 02:02:42,728
Shit!

1543
02:04:21,996 --> 02:04:26,490
"To Lannie Carmichael.

1544
02:04:26,567 --> 02:04:28,899
Christmas, 1932."

1545
02:04:49,056 --> 02:04:50,489
Shit.

1546
02:04:52,326 --> 02:04:54,760
Hey, come on. Wake up.

1547
02:05:02,469 --> 02:05:03,902
Christ!

1548
02:06:02,729 --> 02:06:05,163
All right, I did my side
of the bargain.

1549
02:06:08,202 --> 02:06:10,136
Here's your cup.

1550
02:06:14,441 --> 02:06:16,568
You gonna wake up now?

1551
02:06:24,585 --> 02:06:27,713
You want to think about it
a little more.

1552
02:06:33,160 --> 02:06:35,185
Take your time.

1553
02:07:53,440 --> 02:07:56,307
I had this dream, Jack.

1554
02:07:56,376 --> 02:07:58,310
I was married.

1555
02:07:59,780 --> 02:08:02,943
I was married to this beautiful woman.

1556
02:08:05,018 --> 02:08:06,952
And you were there, too.

1557
02:08:10,357 --> 02:08:12,291
I really miss her, Jack.

1558
02:08:14,728 --> 02:08:16,923
Is that okay?

1559
02:08:18,232 --> 02:08:20,200
Can I miss her now?

1560
02:08:23,604 --> 02:08:25,037
Thank you.

1561
02:08:55,569 --> 02:08:58,094
Tempo, okay? Allegro.
Here we go.

1562
02:08:58,171 --> 02:09:01,402
I like New York in June

1563
02:09:01,475 --> 02:09:03,966
How about you

1564
02:09:04,044 --> 02:09:07,343
I like a Gershwin tune

1565
02:09:07,414 --> 02:09:09,814
How about you

1566
02:09:09,883 --> 02:09:12,511
I like a fireside

1567
02:09:12,586 --> 02:09:16,283
When a storm is due

1568
02:09:16,356 --> 02:09:19,052
I like potato chips
and moonlight and motor trips

1569
02:09:19,126 --> 02:09:21,993
How about you

1570
02:09:22,062 --> 02:09:24,895
I'm mad about good books

1571
02:09:29,202 --> 02:09:31,898
Hi, sweetheart!
Where you been?

1572
02:09:36,176 --> 02:09:39,111
What's this face all about?
Why are you crying?

1573
02:09:40,580 --> 02:09:42,571
Are you my girl?

1574
02:09:44,718 --> 02:09:46,652
Are you my girl?

1575
02:09:47,554 --> 02:09:48,987
Yes.

1576
02:09:56,330 --> 02:09:57,763
Baby.

1577
02:09:58,865 --> 02:10:00,127
Tempo.

1578
02:10:01,234 --> 02:10:05,330
Holding hands in the movie show
when all the lights are low

1579
02:10:05,405 --> 02:10:07,930
May not be new

1580
02:10:08,008 --> 02:10:10,169
But I like it

1581
02:10:13,146 --> 02:10:15,910
How about you

1582
02:10:34,067 --> 02:10:35,500
Well?

1583
02:10:40,774 --> 02:10:44,335
What do you expect me to do?
Applaud?

1584
02:10:53,086 --> 02:10:55,350
What? What?

1585
02:10:55,422 --> 02:10:57,617
What'd you come here for?

1586
02:10:57,691 --> 02:11:00,057
Did you come to get the rest of
your stuff? There's no more stuff.

1587
02:11:00,127 --> 02:11:02,823
It all got burned, accidentally.

1588
02:11:09,069 --> 02:11:12,197
Whatever the hell it is you're doing,
don't do it.

1589
02:11:12,272 --> 02:11:15,298
You don't show up out of nowhere,
stand there like a statue...

1590
02:11:15,375 --> 02:11:17,969
and make me do all the work.

1591
02:11:18,044 --> 02:11:20,638
What did you come here for?

1592
02:11:25,452 --> 02:11:27,579
I...

1593
02:11:27,654 --> 02:11:29,087
love you.

1594
02:11:33,927 --> 02:11:35,417
What?

1595
02:11:46,573 --> 02:11:50,339
I didn't get that.
Run it by me again.

1596
02:12:00,253 --> 02:12:01,686
I think--

1597
02:12:03,123 --> 02:12:04,590
I realize...

1598
02:12:09,830 --> 02:12:11,764
I love you.

1599
02:12:13,900 --> 02:12:15,868
You love me, huh?

1600
02:12:30,517 --> 02:12:33,008
You son of a bitch!

1601
02:12:50,203 --> 02:12:52,671
God, what a beautiful night, huh?

1602
02:12:55,275 --> 02:12:58,210
- Hey, look.
- What?

1603
02:12:58,278 --> 02:13:00,940
They're moving.

1604
02:13:01,982 --> 02:13:03,950
Am I doing that?

1605
02:13:04,017 --> 02:13:06,281
You crazy? It's the wind.

1606
02:13:10,690 --> 02:13:14,091
I like New York in June

1607
02:13:14,160 --> 02:13:17,391
How about you

1608
02:13:17,464 --> 02:13:21,400
I like a Gershwin tune

1609
02:13:21,468 --> 02:13:24,164
How about you

1610
02:13:34,247 --> 02:13:35,680
Good night.

1611
02:13:42,856 --> 02:13:44,551
Good night, Manhattan!

1612
02:13:44,624 --> 02:13:46,558
- Say "Good night," Jack.
- Good night, Jack.

1613
02:17:26,846 --> 02:17:30,043
