1
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:51,181
Lucille: Tony, don't forget
to tell uncle Louie

2
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,171
that I left the red wine
and the parmesan

3
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:54,627
in the refrigerator, all right.

4
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:55,836
- Bye-bye.
- Daniel: Okay.

5
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:56,931
Bye, Judy.

6
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,471
Judy: Send me a picture.

7
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,119
I'll be back soon.
Don't worry about it.

8
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:02,600
Lucille: Be careful. Be careful, now.

9
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:04,349
Judy: Bye.

10
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,554
Daniel: Take it easy now.

11
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:07,014
All: Bye!

12
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,244
All: Bye!

13
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:36,922
Lucille:
California, here we come

14
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:38,129
oh, come on, Daniel.

15
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:39,826
What's the matter?
You don't like my singing?

16
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,119
Daniel: I don't like the song, ma.

17
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:43,008
You're gonna love California.

18
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,943
You get up in the morning,
you roll out of bed.

19
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:46,291
Plop. You're in your swimming pool.

20
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:47,395
Yeah, sure.

21
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:48,892
All right. You'll see.

22
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:51,566
You know, this isn't exactly
a dump we're moving to, you know.

23
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:01,928
Lucille: Push, Daniel. Push!

24
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,427
Give it all you got, kid.
Come on, push it!

25
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:05,633
Push!

26
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,386
Okay, okay, we got it! Got it!

27
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:10,053
Come on, come on, come on,
get in, get in. Hurry up!

28
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:15,149
We did it again. Way to go!

29
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,552
Lucille: Daniel.

30
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,925
Daniel! Come on, wake up.

31
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,972
Look off the starboard bow.

32
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,676
Paradise at last!

33
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:52,179
Oh, we made it.

34
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,808
Come on. This is it.

35
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:59,353
This is the end of the line.

36
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,901
You're telling me.

37
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,825
Come on. All hands on deck.

38
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:10,197
We got to get this thing unloaded
before it sinks.

39
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:14,618
Look at those palm trees!

40
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,419
Damn! Do you know what that means?

41
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,792
Yeah. Watch out for falling coconuts.

42
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:21,751
Wise guy. No more Newark winters!

43
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:22,960
I like winters, ma.

44
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,214
Oh, you like sore throats?

45
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:26,092
You like frozen toes?

46
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:27,593
I don't like smog.

47
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,640
Did I tell you about the pool here?

48
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,639
About 100 times, ma.

49
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,812
Okay, so make it 101.

50
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:36,106
Open your eyes, my darling son.

51
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:38,354
This is the garden of Eden.

52
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:39,480
Come on.

53
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:42,278
Listen, we're in apartment 20, okay?

54
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,855
One flight up.

55
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:00,831
Eeeyah!

56
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:03,758
Oh. Are you okay?

57
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,448
Yeah. No, I'm okay.
No, don't worry about it.

58
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,053
- Have a hand up, man.
- Thanks.

59
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,242
You all right?
I shouldn't have done that.

60
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,911
- Yeah, sure. Don't worry about it.
- That was stupid. You all right?

61
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:11,537
So you got to be the new people
in apartment 20, right?

62
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:12,892
Oh, yeah. I guess so.

63
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,727
Hey, Freddy Fernandez. Apartment 17.

64
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:15,975
Daniel larusso.

65
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:17,335
Hey, how you doing?
Hey, let me help you.

66
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,359
Oh, no, no. It's okay.

67
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,504
I got it. Don't worry about it.

68
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:21,255
It's fine. It's heavy. It's heavy, man.
Yeah.

69
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,519
Hey, where are you from?

70
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:23,694
New Jersey.

71
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:24,862
What you doing out here?

72
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,066
My mom got a job with
some company out here.

73
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,196
Rockets, computers,
flight of the future.

74
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,287
I don't know.

75
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:31,703
Never heard of it.

76
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,496
It's up-and-coming.

77
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,581
Is this the only pool you guys got here?

78
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:36,784
Yeah, that's it.

79
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,118
Hey, what was that? Karate?

80
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,297
What? Oh, yeah.

81
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,921
Yeah? Been doing it long?

82
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,123
A while.

83
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:44,378
Ever use it?

84
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:45,675
A couple of times, you know.

85
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,343
Freddy: Bet you can kick some ass, huh?

86
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,920
Yeah, I'd like to learn someday.

87
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,551
Maybe you could teach me sometime.

88
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:51,786
Okay, sure, that's cool. Anytime.

89
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:52,845
Oh, great.

90
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:55,973
This place is a dump.
You should go back to New Jersey.

91
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:58,472
How'd you know I was from Jersey?

92
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:01,559
'Cause I'm from New Jersey.
I got a nose for my own.

93
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:02,653
Well, what part?

94
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:03,737
Parsippany.

95
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:04,822
Parsippany?

96
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:05,906
Never should have left.

97
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:07,593
Yeah. I got an uncle Louie
from parsippany.

98
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:08,697
Louie fontini?

99
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:09,785
No, Louie larusso.

100
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,950
Louie larusso? Yeah.

101
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,368
Don't know him.

102
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:15,701
Hey, pup. Hey, pup.
How are you doing, boy?

103
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:16,792
You thirsty, hun?

104
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:18,454
She's crazy.

105
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:19,545
What?

106
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,244
She's not playing with a full deck, man.

107
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:22,339
Aw, she's nice.

108
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:23,734
Hey, what are you doing tomorrow?

109
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,373
What? I don't know. I guess nothing.

110
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,405
Hey, we're having a beach party,
sort of, "adios, summer."

111
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:28,464
You wanna come?

112
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:29,670
Yeah, sure, that's cool.

113
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,576
Hey, great. I'll come get you
in the morning, all right?

114
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,660
All right, all right, that's cool.

115
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:33,924
Hey, here's apartment 20, man.

116
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:35,019
Oh, this is it?

117
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,247
Yeah. Should I leave this here?

118
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,011
Yeah, yeah. Hey, thanks for the help.

119
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,866
Hey, no problem.
Nice meeting you, all right?

120
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,935
Appreciate it. You, too.

121
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,378
Take care.
I'll see you tomorrow morning.

122
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,687
- Okay, all right.
- Bye, then.

123
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:46,215
Please don't say anything
about the pool.

124
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,446
I will call first thing in the morning.

125
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:50,803
Hey, ma, did you tell that old lady
with the dog downstairs

126
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:51,907
where we were from?

127
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:54,452
Yeah. Didn't she remind you
of aunt tessy?

128
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,370
Aunt tessy?
More like uncle Louie, really.

129
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,915
You know, I really think
we're gonna do good here.

130
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,333
I have a very positive feeling.

131
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,705
I'm telling you, Daniel.

132
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,457
I just know it's gonna work.

133
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:04,754
Oh, the faucet's broken.

134
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,521
Oh, the real estate lady said that
there's a fix-it guy around here.

135
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,255
See if you can find him, okay?

136
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:10,586
Okay.

137
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,680
What's that for?

138
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,130
This? Oh, uncle Louie's dog.

139
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:14,224
Oh, he's cute.

140
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:15,949
Oh, ma,
I got invited to a party tomorrow.

141
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,019
That's great. You see?

142
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,270
Yeah, I know,
but you wanted me to help you unpack.

143
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:22,268
I don't remember
saying anything about that.

144
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:25,476
Great. I must have you
mixed up with somebody else then.

145
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,935
Thanks, ma.

146
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:33,321
Hey, can you tell me
where the maintenance guy is?

147
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,992
Hey, pup. Here you go.

148
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,661
Yeah, you go in through there,

149
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:38,784
turn left, not too far,

150
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,536
then right. Go inside.

151
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,037
You'll find him on the left.

152
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,664
All right. So I go right, then left.

153
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:47,247
No, no. Left, then right,
then inside on the left.

154
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:07,563
Hello?

155
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,947
Hey, you the maintenance man?

156
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,118
Hal.

157
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,742
Yeah, we're the new people
in apartment 20.

158
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,500
Yeah. Our faucet's really leaking there.

159
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,209
Well, can you come fix it?

160
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:35,385
Hal.

161
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,424
Well, can I tell my mom when?

162
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:40,808
When, what?

163
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,637
When you're gonna fix the faucet.

164
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:45,893
After.

165
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,484
After what?

166
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,692
After! After!

167
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:02,080
Sunshine everyday

168
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,579
think I'm gonna stay

169
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,125
it's always one foot falling down

170
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,209
the good beat, it's my scene

171
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,542
but now's the time fo check it out

172
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:16,844
to really live the California dream

173
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:19,593
it's almost magic

174
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,675
there's something in the air

175
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:22,805
on the beach

176
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,887
bop bop Dee Dee

177
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,643
something's just begun

178
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:28,814
you dig me

179
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,893
bop bop Dee Dee

180
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,899
I will find the one

181
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,070
on the beach

182
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,023
bop bop Dee Dee

183
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,153
here you, guys.

184
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,576
You can always find your dream

185
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:41,766
can I have the ball, please?

186
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,790
Whoa!

187
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:44,080
Thank you.

188
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:45,532
He's pretty good.

189
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:46,627
Showoff.

190
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:47,746
Whoa.

191
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,702
Yes. Let's go, come on.

192
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:51,632
Bye.

193
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:52,716
Hey, wait up!

194
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,850
Hey, who's that...
Who's that blonde in the blue?

195
00:09:58,890 --> 00:09:59,925
The hills.

196
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,176
Hills. What's the hills?

197
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,302
It's rich.

198
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,393
Hey, let's go.

199
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,762
Bop bop Dee Dee

200
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:12,772
lost lost in a cloud

201
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:16,901
nobody knows my name

202
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,305
Freddy: Hey, Danny. Hey, Danny.

203
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,364
What? What?

204
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,116
I think the blonde is looking at you.

205
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:25,322
Oh, yeah, right.

206
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,998
I'm serious. I think
she has the hots for you, man.

207
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:29,480
Oh, who could blame her? Right, Freddy?

208
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:31,460
Oh, yeah? Then why don't you
make a move?

209
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:32,548
No, I'm eating, man.

210
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,110
How could you think about eating, man?
Go make a move.

211
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,134
I'm hungry.

212
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:37,379
Maybe they ain't got no moves
where he comes from.

213
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,756
No, I got moves where I come from.
Yeah, yeah...

214
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:41,408
We have more moves
back there than here...

215
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,077
- Oh, yeah? Yeah?
- I'll tell you that much.

216
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:44,101
Yeah.

217
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,300
We'll see. Yeah.

218
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:48,266
It takes two lo tango

219
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,687
boy: Come on, buddy. Go, get her.

220
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,454
All right, all right.
I'm going. I'm going.

221
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,724
All: Go get her. Go get her.

222
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:53,854
Come on.

223
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:55,355
I'm going, okay?

224
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,566
Hey, did you lose something?

225
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,192
Yeah. I hope we're not bothering you.

226
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:00,069
Hey, how do you, uh, how do you juggle?

227
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,491
Oh, it's pretty easy.

228
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:04,035
It's... you just...
I start with my knee.

229
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:06,454
You just go one.
You know, one at a time. One.

230
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,577
And then you try, two. One, two.

231
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,659
- You try it. Three, four.
- Four.

232
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,914
Try it. Just bring your leg up.
One. Good!

233
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,505
All right!

234
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:21,712
That was awesome!

235
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,673
Brew time, man!
Who's for a warm one? Here you go.

236
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,303
- No, I pass, man.
- Hey, Bobby.

237
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,394
No, thanks, pal.

238
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,373
Johnny, who are you kidding?
You're still the Ace degenerate.

239
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,262
No, ex-degenerate, man.

240
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,063
8:00 A.M. tomorrow, I'm a senior.

241
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:34,732
I've got one year to make it all work.

242
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,559
And that's what I'm gonna do.
Make it work.

243
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:37,689
All of it, right?

244
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,780
That's right, man.

245
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,730
Hey, you must be a trendsetter, Johnny.

246
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,656
Looks like everyone's
doing something new.

247
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:44,200
- What?
- Take a right. Check it out.

248
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,738
Hey, Johnny, forget it, man.
It's ancient history.

249
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:49,833
Who told you, man?

250
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:50,918
Johnny!

251
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:52,062
Hey, man, I thought they broke up.

252
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,086
She did. He didn't.

253
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,503
Here, come on. Try it.

254
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:58,798
Yeah. Watch this.

255
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,217
Oh. Well, I'll get it.
I'll be right back.

256
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,753
Those were the nights

257
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,839
dancing around the street light

258
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:07,845
you were in my eye

259
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:12,930
we were a team racing to a night dream

260
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:15,686
radio played on

261
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,549
Johnny: Hey, Ali, I want to talk to you.

262
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,029
Ali: You just leave me alone.

263
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,385
We've been over all this, all right?

264
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,524
I don't want to talk.

265
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,179
Well, I want to talk to you, all right?

266
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,184
What is your problem?

267
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,436
Look, why don't you take your cobra kais
and get out of here?

268
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,496
Oh, yeah, right.
And that's gonna solve everything.

269
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,122
- Give me my radio.
- No.

270
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:37,624
I said, give me my radio!

271
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,401
Johnny: You promise you'll talk?
You promise?

272
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,905
Ali: Yes, just give me my radio. Yes.

273
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,300
You just break my radio?

274
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,053
Yeah. Yeah.

275
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,883
Don't touch it, punk.

276
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:52,802
What are you, deaf?

277
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,433
Oh, man. What's going on?

278
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:55,639
You want it?

279
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:56,768
Yeah, just give it...

280
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:57,974
You got it!

281
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:00,025
Cobra members: All right!

282
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,238
- Freddy: Come on, Daniel.
- Come on.

283
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,155
Ali: Johnny, stop it, will you?
Please... don't...

284
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,160
All: Yeah!

285
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:11,784
Stop it! Stop it!

286
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,364
I didn't do anything.

287
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:15,992
Toro! Huh, toro.

288
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,338
You're a big man now, huh?

289
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,175
Look, you started this.

290
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:26,173
All wanted to do was talk to you.

291
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:28,129
Then just leave him alone
and we'll go talk.

292
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,930
Yeah. Where did I hear that before?

293
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,510
How about you, hero? You have enough?

294
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:34,604
All: Yeah, yeah.

295
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:35,769
Okay.

296
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:37,347
Okay, man. Now we're even, huh?

297
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:40,525
No mercy, man. No mercy.

298
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,698
Cobra member:
Come on, Johnny. Come on now.

299
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,280
Let go of me!

300
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,827
Why don't you hit me?

301
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,905
You think you're gonna
make me feel better, huh?

302
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,520
- It's your fault.
- It's not my fault.

303
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,496
- It's your fault.
- Everything is your fault!

304
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,418
Why do you have to always fight, huh?

305
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,917
Bullshit. Get on your bikes, guys.

306
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,132
Far out, man.

307
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:12,845
Boy 1: You sure pick cool people
to be friends with, Freddy.

308
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,335
Boy 2: Where did you find this guy?

309
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:17,929
Come on, let's go. He'll be all right.

310
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,026
Are you okay?

311
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,698
Oh, just leave me alone.

312
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:30,786
Uh, just...

313
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,950
I'll help you.

314
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,699
No, just leave me alone. I'm okay.

315
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,790
Just leave me alone.

316
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,114
Come on, Ali. Let's go.

317
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,575
Come on, it's better
if we leave him alone.

318
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:39,784
Come on.

319
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,045
Come on.

320
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:46,590
Come on. Let's go.

321
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,687
Lucille: Daniel.

322
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:08,198
En!

323
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:09,401
Daniel: Hi, ma.

324
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:10,607
How was the party?

325
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:11,941
It was okay.

326
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,776
It must have been more than okay.

327
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,281
I didn't even hear you come home.

328
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:16,453
Any friend material?

329
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,327
Yeah, some. Couple of guys. I got to go.

330
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:19,453
Sit down and eat first.

331
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:20,624
No, I'm not hungry.

332
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,064
Come on, you need energy to be charming.

333
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,399
I'm fine, I'm telling you. I got energy.

334
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,423
Do me a favor.

335
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:26,168
- What?
- Take off the glasses.

336
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,259
Why?

337
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:28,343
Because I asked you to.

338
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,967
Come on, ma. It's California.
It's the look...

339
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,637
Come on, take them off.
I want to see your baby browns.

340
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,044
Ma, come on with the baby browns.

341
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,341
Are you on something?

342
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,097
Yeah, ma. Minute maid...

343
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,347
Why are you hiding your eyes?

344
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,582
I'm not hiding my eyes, ma. Come on...

345
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,188
- Then take off the glasses. Now.
- Ma, come on.

346
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:51,239
Oh, my god. How did that happen, huh?

347
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,405
What happened?

348
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,199
I hit a curb with my bike and it hit me.

349
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,849
I wore the glasses 'cause I didn't want
you to worry. It looks worse...

350
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:58,392
Don't do that. It's gonna make it worse.

351
00:15:58,416 --> 00:15:59,810
- Ma, it doesn't hurt.
- Can you see?

352
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:01,562
- I can see fine, all right.
- Do you wanna stay home from school?

353
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:02,586
No, no, I got to go.

354
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:24,730
Hot summer streets
and the pavements are burning

355
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,728
I sit around

356
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:34,316
trying to smile but the air
is so heavy and dry

357
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,865
strange voices are saying

358
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,824
chorus: What did they say?

359
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,707
Things I can't understand

360
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,042
it's too close for comfort

361
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:52,125
this heat has got right out of hand

362
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:59,348
it's a cruel, cruel summer

363
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,724
Daniel: Hey, guys!
Freddy, how you doing?

364
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,396
Hey, karate kid.

365
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:07,815
Let's see the moves.

366
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,988
Come on, man. He knows
how to get his butt kicked.

367
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:12,278
Hey, I already know that move.

368
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,301
Come on, let's get out of here.
Let's get out of here.

369
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:15,485
Hey, think fast.

370
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:18,745
How you doing?

371
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,829
Ooh, your eye.

372
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:22,530
Oh, don't worry. It looks worse
than it feels, believe me.

373
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,081
Yeah, I hope so.

374
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,955
Listen, I never got
a chance to thank you.

375
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,411
Oh, no. That was nothing.

376
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:30,747
I'm just sorry about your radio.

377
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,672
Yeah, I'm more sorry about your eye.

378
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,696
I mean, I guess you should've
just given it to him.

379
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,301
Why? It wasn't his, right?

380
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,096
Yeah, it wasn't his.

381
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,063
See that? We think alike already.

382
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:43,180
You know what else we do alike?

383
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:48,268
Hey, you've been practicing.

384
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:50,062
Girl: Cheerleaders, over here.

385
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,437
Oh, I got to go.

386
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:52,529
I'll see you.

387
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:53,613
Okay. Bye.

388
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:56,155
Bye-bye. Hey, you got a name?

389
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:57,649
Ali, with an "I."

390
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,492
Hey, what's your name?

391
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,992
Daniel, with an "I."

392
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,948
I'll see you later.

393
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:08,785
Definitely.

394
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,835
It's a cruel, cruel summer

395
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,879
now you're gone

396
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:28,809
Cheerleaders: Fight, win! Touchdown!

397
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:31,891
Go, fight, win! Touchdown!

398
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:34,352
Go, fight, win!

399
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,446
Boy 1: Get him hard. Get him...

400
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,826
Daniel: I got him. I got him.

401
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:50,952
Where are you?

402
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,621
Have a nice trip?

403
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,837
Boy 2: Coach, look what he's doing.
Look what he's doing to Bobby!

404
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,407
Hey, nobody hits me! I'm gonna tear
your face off! I'm gonna kill him.

405
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:01,671
Kill him, Bobby! Kill him.

406
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:04,508
Get out! There's no place on this team
for that kind of crap.

407
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:05,682
Well, he hooked me, man!

408
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,510
I said, out of here!

409
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:09,374
What are you looking at?
Back to it. Let's go.

410
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,184
This school sucks, man!

411
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,355
Coach: I said, out of here.

412
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:13,649
It sucks!

413
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,528
Cheerleaders: Go, fight, win! Touchdown!

414
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:24,743
Go, fight, win! Touchdown!

415
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:29,448
Go, fight, win! Touchdown!

416
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,787
Go, fight, win! Touchdown!

417
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:39,801
Daniel: Two, three, four,

418
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,969
five, six, seven...

419
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:46,893
Fix faucet.

420
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:49,559
Oh, yeah, come on in.
It's the kitchen one.

421
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:54,015
One, two, three...

422
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,725
Oh, karate.

423
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,230
Four. Yeah.

424
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,232
Five, six...

425
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,563
Very good.

426
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:01,741
Seven...

427
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:02,826
Learn from book?

428
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:03,910
Eight...

429
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:06,139
Yeah, and a few months
at the y in Newark where I lived.

430
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,163
Nine...

431
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:08,248
Oh.

432
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:12,120
10, 11, 12,

433
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,920
13,

434
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:15,588
14,

435
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:17,132
15...

436
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,256
What happened to eye?

437
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:21,584
Oh, I fell off my bike.

438
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,170
18, 19.

439
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,931
Lucky no hurt to hand.

440
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,813
One, two...

441
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,362
Hi.

442
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,953
Hey, Ali with an "1." How you doing?

443
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,279
Good.

444
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,534
Not too hungry today.

445
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,625
Hmm, not really.

446
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,122
Here, have some pie. I made it myself.

447
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,212
Yeah?

448
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,662
So, how do you like the valley so far?

449
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,339
Well, it hasn't been dull.

450
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:01,757
Was Newark dull?

451
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,631
How'd you know I was from Newark?

452
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:05,802
I asked.

453
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,175
Oh, really?

454
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,465
You sitting with anybody?

455
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,800
With you, if it's okay.

456
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:12,510
Sounds great to me. You want some milk?

457
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:13,605
Yeah, thanks.

458
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:16,180
Listen, I'm sorry
about the soccer tryouts.

459
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,685
Those are the breaks, you know.

460
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:21,152
No, you remember that guy
I had trouble with on the beach?

461
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,024
Oh, yeah. King karate?

462
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,071
Yeah. That was my ex-boyfriend.

463
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:27,320
Oh, that's good to know. What?

464
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,572
What? Oh, yeah, you're right.
You're right. I know...

465
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:30,823
What are you doing?

466
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:32,496
It's just this little voice, you know.

467
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,619
It's telling me
I got to be some kind of a yo-yo

468
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,896
to be talking to you right now.

469
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,535
That'll be $2.50.

470
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,336
Wait, for both.

471
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,629
$3.75.

472
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:41,831
$3.75.

473
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:43,507
Yeah, well, it doesn't matter, anyway.

474
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:44,879
Why is that?

475
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,176
Because it's over.

476
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:48,675
It's over? Wait. How over?

477
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:49,801
Weeks.

478
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:52,850
Weeks. One week? Five weeks?
How many weeks is "weeks"?

479
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:05,105
John: Fear does not exist
in this dojo, does it?

480
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:06,530
Students: No, sensei!

481
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:09,529
Pain does not exist
in this dojo, does it?

482
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,985
No, sensei!

483
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,163
Defeat does not exist
in this dojo, does it?

484
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,535
No, sensei!

485
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:18,834
Fear does not exist
in this dojo, does it?

486
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:20,206
No, sensei!

487
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:23,585
Pain does not exist
in this dojo, does it?

488
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:25,041
No, sensei!

489
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:28,377
Defeat does not exist
in this dojo, does it?

490
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,303
No, sensei!

491
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:31,631
Prepare!

492
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,052
What do we study here?

493
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,808
Students: The way of defense, sir!

494
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:41,106
And what is that way?

495
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,855
Strike first, strike hard,
no mercy, sir!

496
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:46,062
I can't hear you!

497
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:49,273
Strike first, strike hard,
no mercy, sir!

498
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,196
Mr. Lawrence.

499
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:53,494
Johnny: Yes, sensei.

500
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:55,988
John: Warm them up.

501
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,464
Johnny: Fighting positions!

502
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,595
Jab punch. Ready!

503
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:26,144
Guess what?

504
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,238
What?

505
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:29,439
I'm gonna be trained as a manager.

506
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:30,693
Isn't that great?

507
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:31,819
Yeah.

508
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:34,277
They got this program.
It's two nights a week.

509
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:36,327
As soon as a spot opens up, you're in.

510
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:40,283
And the benefits... I could never
get them working in computers.

511
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,368
They pay for everything.

512
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,120
That's great, ma.

513
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:48,920
What's the matter, Daniel?

514
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,251
Nothing.

515
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:54,086
Okay. Remember when you
went to the country for the summer

516
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:57,633
and you hated it because you had
no friends? What happened?

517
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:00,519
I got poison Ivy.

518
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:01,971
You met Kevin and Kenny

519
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:04,899
who became your best friends
in the whole world.

520
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:08,728
You got to give it a try.

521
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:13,237
Hey, I know it's hard,
but we're not quitters, are we?

522
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,030
I guess not.

523
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,453
What's with the karate place?

524
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,825
No, it sucks.

525
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:23,080
Good, because we probably
couldn't afford it, anyway.

526
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,202
And the girl situation?

527
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,297
It's okay.

528
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,372
Just okay?

529
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:31,417
To me, it looks like
the whole world turned blonde.

530
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,132
You got your eye on anybody?

531
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:38,264
Ah. Cute?

532
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,012
No, not cute.

533
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,391
She's... I mean, she's beyond cute.

534
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,143
But she's blonde, though. Right?

535
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:46,519
Yeah. She's got blonde hair.

536
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,692
Woman: Lucille, let's go.
Here they come.

537
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:50,861
Is she... is she as pretty as Judy?

538
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:52,404
Oh, ma, she buries Judy in a second.

539
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,027
She buries Judy?

540
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:55,324
Oh, god.

541
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:57,572
Listen, you'll tell me
about it later. I love you.

542
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:59,528
Careful how you ride home.

543
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,949
Smile. She's got an excellent smile.

544
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,076
She's really smart.

545
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:12,880
I don't know, I'd say she's beautiful.
I think she's beautiful.

546
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:15,131
I think she's something else.

547
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,384
She's hot. Definitely hot.

548
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:50,246
Bobby: Looking for a shortcut
back to Newark, Daniel?

549
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,080
Johnny: No, he wants to learn karate.

550
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:53,361
Well, here's your first lesson.

551
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,420
How to take a fall.

552
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:55,591
Hey, what're you doing?

553
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,340
Bobby: Hey, don't think about the pain.

554
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:30,915
This damn bike. I hate this bike.

555
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:33,839
I hate this frigging bike!
This stupid bike!

556
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,257
God, I hate it.

557
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:37,426
- Daniel, what's the matter?
- Nothing.

558
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:38,923
Why did you throw your bike away?

559
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,254
Because I felt like it, ma.

560
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:41,910
Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you.

561
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:42,969
Oh, my god!

562
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,095
Ma...

563
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:46,643
Oh, my god.
Would you tell me what's goin' on here

564
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,561
and don't tell me
about another bike accident.

565
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:49,793
What do you want to hear, ma?

566
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:50,817
I want to hear the truth.

567
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:51,961
No, you don't want to hear the truth.

568
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,630
All you want to hear is
how great it is out here.

569
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:55,215
Well, maybe it's great for you,
but it sucks for me!

570
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:56,820
I hate this place! I hate it.

571
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:58,022
I just want to go home!

572
00:26:58,117 --> 00:26:59,448
Why can't we just go back home?

573
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,655
Listen to me. “What?

574
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:05,362
I cannot help you
unless you tell me what's wrong.

575
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:06,913
I got to take karate, that's it!

576
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,035
You took karate.

577
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:09,229
No, not in that... not in that...

578
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:10,834
Not at the y. A good school.

579
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:12,377
Fighting doesn't solve anything.

580
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,455
Well, neither does palm trees, ma.

581
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,040
That's not fair.

582
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:17,946
Yeah? Like it was fair coming out here

583
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,656
without asking me
how I felt about it, right.

584
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,466
That was really fair.

585
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,590
You're right.

586
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,012
I should have asked.

587
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,935
Yeah, well,
I just want to go home. That's it.

588
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:31,354
I don't understand the rules here.
I want to go.

589
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:34,308
Let's see if we can figure out
the rules together, okay?

590
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:35,518
What about your bike?

591
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,603
It's safer taking the bus.

592
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:39,063
Why can't we just go home?

593
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:41,695
Why can't we just go home
and forget this place?

594
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:04,888
Yeah. I'll tell you everything he said.

595
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:06,055
You better.

596
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:07,474
- Bye. Bye.
- Bye. See you.

597
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:17,151
I am the river man
taking on a fantasy

598
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:18,272
hey.

599
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:20,233
- Hi.
- How you doing?

600
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:21,905
Ooh, what happened to your forehead?

601
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:23,072
Oh, it was terrible.

602
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,650
It was this gigantic, runaway zit.

603
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:25,745
That's gross.

604
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,286
Daniel, this is Susan.

605
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,613
- Hi.
- Charmed.

606
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,198
Now, come on, what really happened?

607
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:32,874
I got in a bike accident, but I'm okay.

608
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:33,961
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

609
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:36,788
What kind of bike do you have, Daniel?
Honda? Suzuki? What?

610
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:39,919
No, it's a, like,
a miyaji turbo, actually.

611
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,010
Yeah?

612
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:42,174
Oh, really?

613
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:44,253
Well, we're going to the arcade.
You want to come?

614
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:45,884
Yeah, sure. Sounds great to me.

615
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:49,182
Check out this new game
I want to show you.

616
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:53,770
I just remembered I got to...

617
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,501
I got to... I forgot something.

618
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:57,212
So I'll catch up with you guys
in a minute, okay?

619
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:58,692
Daniel, you don't have to run away.

620
00:28:58,779 --> 00:28:59,964
I'm not running away from anything.

621
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,424
Hey, look, we've got to deal with it.

622
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,509
You deal with things your way,
I'll deal with them mine, okay?

623
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:04,573
I'll see you. I got to go.

624
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,660
Daniel...

625
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:07,071
Get off my case!

626
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,398
Did you fix my bike?

627
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:47,907
Hal.

628
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,568
Thank you.

629
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:50,830
Welcome.

630
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,779
Yeah. I really appreciate that.

631
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:56,458
Are those real trees?

632
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,293
You like see, come inside.

633
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,255
Thanks.

634
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:12,049
How did they get so small?

635
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:13,350
I trim.

636
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:16,262
Clip here, tie there.

637
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:19,352
Where did you learn how? Japan?

638
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:20,523
Okinawa.

639
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,267
Where's that?

640
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,144
My country.

641
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:30,405
China, here. Japan, here. Okinawa, here.

642
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,534
You go to school for this?

643
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:35,989
Father teach.

644
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,291
Was he a gardener?

645
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:39,868
Fisherman.

646
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,169
Fisherman?

647
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:43,922
These are really beautiful.

648
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:46,591
Come. You try.

649
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,156
No, I don't know how to do this stuff.

650
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,180
No, no, no. Sit down.

651
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:52,301
No, no, I may mess it up.
I don't want to mess it up or something.

652
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,015
Close eye.

653
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:57,306
Trust.

654
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:02,561
Concentrate.

655
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,770
Think only tree.

656
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:12,401
Make a perfect picture
down to last pine needle.

657
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:18,206
Wipe your mind clean
everything but tree.

658
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:22,628
Nothing exists whole world.

659
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,338
Only tree.

660
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:28,962
You got it?

661
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:31,590
Open eye.

662
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,090
Remember picture?

663
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:36,685
Yeah.

664
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:39,219
Make like picture.

665
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:50,814
Just trust picture.

666
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:54,906
But how do I know
if my picture's the right one?

667
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:58,534
If come from inside you,
always right one.

668
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:34,949
Hi.

669
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,572
Hey, ma. Come on in.

670
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,279
You fixed your bike.

671
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,239
No, no, Mr. miyaji fixed it.

672
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,122
Oh, wow. Great. Thank you.

673
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:46,294
How much do we owe you?

674
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:48,963
Oh, no, please. My pleasure.

675
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,707
That's very nice.

676
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:54,548
Hiya, champ.

677
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:55,931
Hey.

678
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,180
What are you doing?

679
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:01,180
I'm trimming my baby tree here.

680
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:03,269
Bonsai tree.

681
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,055
Banzai tree.

682
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:06,481
Bonsai.

683
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:07,943
Bonsai.

684
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:10,063
They're beautiful.

685
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:11,861
Yeah, Mr. miyaji learned it in okinawa.

686
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,154
That's where he's from.

687
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,527
Really? It's so delicate.

688
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:22,281
For me?

689
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:24,532
Oh, no, I couldn't.

690
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:26,744
Oh, please. Hurt feeling.

691
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:30,372
That's very nice. Thank you.

692
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:31,582
You're welcome.

693
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,883
I know just where it'll go.

694
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,380
Come on. It's getting late.

695
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:37,303
All right, ma.
I'll be up in half an hour.

696
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,972
No, we got to go now. School tomorrow.

697
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,516
Thank you for everything.

698
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:42,888
You're welcome.

699
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:49,313
Oh. Don't forget the tree.
Must practice.

700
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:51,403
Thank you.

701
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:52,773
Sayonara.

702
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:53,899
Sayonara.

703
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,025
Good night.

704
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:57,152
Hey, thanks again. I'll see you.

705
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,505
Hey, ma, you know,
he gave you the nicest one.

706
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:03,851
- I know.
- This guy's something else.

707
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,786
Did you see...
You saw what he did to my bike.

708
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,208
This guy's great.

709
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:10,631
Girl: Hi.

710
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:40,200
Oh, Daniel-San.
Happy Halloween. You like?

711
00:34:40,287 --> 00:34:41,652
Yeah, that's nice.

712
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:44,704
How school today? Lot's happening.

713
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:48,788
What's the matter? You not going?

714
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:50,209
Daniel: Nah.

715
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:51,463
How come?

716
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:54,498
I'm not into dancing that much.

717
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,667
I don't feel like it, anyway.

718
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:02,051
Oh, Daniel-San, you too
much by self. Not good.

719
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:06,225
I'm not by myself. I'm with you.

720
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:11,933
To make honey, young bee
need young flower, not old prune.

721
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:15,439
I don't have a costume, anyway.

722
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,901
If have costume, you go?

723
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:22,738
Yeah, maybe if I went
as the invisible man.

724
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,911
"Invisible man"?

725
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:28,331
Yeah, you know, so no one would see me.

726
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:30,336
Oh.

727
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:36,165
Lookin' for you, impatiently

728
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:40,384
past hasn't been easy for me

729
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:44,389
I've been so far away

730
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:46,303
hey, there's Daniel.

731
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:47,429
Where?

732
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,520
The shower.

733
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:49,605
How do you know?

734
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,680
I just know. May I?

735
00:35:53,193 --> 00:35:55,058
Don't know what she sees in him.

736
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,984
She must be into fungus.

737
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,450
Ali: Help me! Help me!
My flower needs water!

738
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,659
Hey, you've come to
the right place, stranger.

739
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,700
Yeah, I've never
danced in a shower before.

740
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:12,897
I had a friend of mine make this for me.

741
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:13,921
It's fun.

742
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,211
Isn't it great?

743
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,209
So, where have you been hiding?

744
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,961
Well, I haven't been hiding.

745
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:20,667
No, I haven't seen you around.

746
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:22,047
You been looking?

747
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,173
Sort of.

748
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,264
Sort of?

749
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:27,136
I thought maybe you
were still angry with me.

750
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:28,512
Why?

751
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,639
Well, because of what I said
last time I saw you.

752
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,846
Oh, no, no.
I've been thinking a lot about that.

753
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:35,774
No, I know. But I should really
just learn to mind my own business.

754
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,976
No. I think you're right
about facing things head-on.

755
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:39,857
I mean, I feel the same way.

756
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:42,321
I just kind of forgot for a while.

757
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,070
Thanks for reminding me.

758
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,988
You're welcome.

759
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:50,367
It's just that he thinks
he can do whatever he wants to people.

760
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,458
Who?

761
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:52,543
Johnny.

762
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:53,627
Oh.

763
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:55,564
I'd love to see him get
a dose of his own medicine.

764
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,579
Well, you know,
what goes around comes around.

765
00:36:57,674 --> 00:36:59,756
I'd love to be there when it does.

766
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:01,379
Yeah. Me, too.

767
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,181
So, you want to go outside?

768
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,267
You talked me into it.

769
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,185
Check out this chicken. He's wild!

770
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:22,278
Ali: That guy's using real eggs.

771
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:24,165
- Daniel: This guy is great.
- He hit someone.

772
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,322
No! No!

773
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:33,494
Johnny. Johnny.

774
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:39,423
Johnny.

775
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:44,739
You got the number
rolled yet, man?

776
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:45,798
In a minute.

777
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:46,991
All right, I'm gonna go get the guys.

778
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:48,346
- Okay.
- Hey, hurry up.

779
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:47,192
Johnny: Shit!

780
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:48,283
Hey, man.

781
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:50,074
Daniel: Look out. Watch it. Move, man!

782
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:56,497
Hey, Johnny, what's up?

783
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,752
Get out of the way!
Get out of my way! Look out!

784
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,330
Daniel, what's wrong?

785
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,584
It's coming around.

786
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,346
Get up!

787
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:15,933
Get out of my way!

788
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:23,277
Man 1: What's he...

789
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:25,901
Man 2: What the hell are you doing?

790
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,480
Get out of the way!

791
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:41,246
Danger

792
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:44,837
everywhere I turn

793
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:49,839
no shelter, and the truth is under fire

794
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:53,922
there ain't no lookin' back

795
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:56,803
you put it all behind

796
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,353
when you're runnin' out of time

797
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:05,517
boy: He ain't going over.

798
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:09,437
We got him now.

799
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:12,323
You little wimp.

800
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:18,579
You couldn't leave well enough alone,
could you, little twerp?

801
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,372
No, you had to push it.

802
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,791
Well, now, you're gonna pay.

803
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:25,704
Where are you going, sweetheart?

804
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:28,214
How about a front kick, Johnny?

805
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:34,222
Get him up.

806
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:36,138
Bobby: Leave him alone, man.
He's had enough.

807
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:37,305
Shut up, Bobby!

808
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:38,993
Look at him.
God, he can't even stand up.

809
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:40,893
- Johnny: So what?
- That don't mean squat.

810
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,642
Johnny, leave him alone, man.
He's had enough!

811
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:45,269
I'll decide when he's had enough, man.

812
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,021
What is wrong with you, Johnny?

813
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,318
- The enemy deserves no mercy. Right?
- Right.

814
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:50,770
Right. _right.

815
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:51,865
Bobby: You're crazy, man!

816
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:58,411
Tommy, Bobby, get him!

817
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:30,276
Daniel-San.

818
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:32,858
Come.

819
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:47,368
Miyagi got you.

820
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:16,822
Leave on.

821
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:18,650
It stinks, man. What is this?

822
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:20,485
Smell bad, heal good.

823
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:26,749
Hey, where did spiderman go?

824
00:42:26,836 --> 00:42:27,871
Who?

825
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:31,170
That guy. That guy who bailed me out.
Where did he go?

826
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:35,841
What, you?

827
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:38,889
No way.

828
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,088
Why no way?

829
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:41,218
Because, because...

830
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:43,470
Because, because old man?

831
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:47,349
Have tea. Feel better.

832
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,589
How come you didn't tell me?

833
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:16,836
Tell you what?

834
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:18,589
That you knew karate.

835
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:19,839
You never ask.

836
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:21,762
Where'd you learn it from?

837
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,009
Father.

838
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:25,098
I thought he was a fisherman.

839
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:31,226
In okinawa, all miyagi know two thing,
fish and karate.

840
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:35,227
Karate come from China, 16th century.

841
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,395
Called "te." "Hand."

842
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:43,534
Much later,
miyagi ancestor call "karate".

843
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:45,908
"Empty hand."

844
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:50,325
I always thought it came from
Buddhist temples and stuff like that.

845
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:52,998
You have too much TV.

846
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:55,747
That's what my mother tells me.

847
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:02,420
Hey, you ever taught anyone?

848
00:44:02,515 --> 00:44:03,515
No.

849
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:04,714
Would you?

850
00:44:05,268 --> 00:44:06,268
Depend.

851
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:07,512
On what?

852
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:08,809
Reason.

853
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,015
How's revenge?

854
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:17,936
Daniel-San, you look revenge that way,
start by digging two grave.

855
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:21,356
Well, at least I have company, right?

856
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:24,613
Fighting always last answer to problem.

857
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:29,035
No offense, Mr. miyaji, but I don't
think you understand my problem.

858
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:32,208
Miyagi understand problem perfect.

859
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:37,080
Your friend all karate student, eh?

860
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:41,925
Problem, attitude.

861
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:44,970
No, problem is I'm getting
my ass kicked every other day.

862
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,057
That's the problem.

863
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:49,680
Because boys have bad attitude.

864
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:53,145
Karate for defense only.

865
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:56,895
That's not what these guys
are taught, man.

866
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:58,984
I can see.

867
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,688
No such thing bad student.

868
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:03,363
Only bad teacher.

869
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:06,158
Teacher say, student do.

870
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:09,324
Oh, great.
That solves everything for me.

871
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:12,248
I'll just go to the school
and straighten it out with the teacher.

872
00:45:12,335 --> 00:45:13,575
No problem.

873
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:16,832
Now use head for something
other than target.

874
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:20,589
I was only kidding about that.

875
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:22,041
Why kidding?

876
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:24,092
Because I'll get killed
if I show up there.

877
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:26,512
Get killed anyway.

878
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:34,261
Would you go with me?

879
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:37,022
No, can't.

880
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,524
Why? You said it was a good idea, right?

881
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:41,443
For you, good idea.

882
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:44,442
For me, good idea no get involved.

883
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:46,569
Oh, but you already are involved.
I mean, you...

884
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:47,661
Very sorry.

885
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:48,780
What?

886
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:56,492
Well, thanks for nothing then, man.

887
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:57,959
Thanks for nothing.

888
00:45:58,047 --> 00:46:00,379
Like I didn't have
enough problems already.

889
00:46:01,384 --> 00:46:03,028
Now I got to carry
your weight, too. Thanks.

890
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:05,088
Don't do me any more favors, okay, pal.

891
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:06,294
Daniel-San?

892
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:07,389
What?

893
00:46:11,227 --> 00:46:13,218
Okay, I go.

894
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:17,972
Oh, excellent, excellent,
Mr. miyaiji, this is great.

895
00:46:18,067 --> 00:46:19,182
Miyagi.

896
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:21,813
Miyagi. Miyagi.

897
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:23,986
Hey, what kind of belt do you have?

898
00:46:24,073 --> 00:46:26,189
Canvas. You like?

899
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:29,200
J.c. Penney. $3.98.

900
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:31,243
Oh, I didn't mean a belt
like that. I meant...

901
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:34,413
In okinawa, belt mean
no need rope hold up pants.

902
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:38,910
That's funny.

903
00:46:39,005 --> 00:46:40,005
Daniel-San.

904
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:41,169
What?

905
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:45,087
Karate here.

906
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:48,298
Karate here.

907
00:46:49,265 --> 00:46:51,551
Karate never here.

908
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:54,767
You understand?

909
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:57,811
I think so.

910
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:01,849
Good night, Daniel-San.

911
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:05,520
Good night, Mr. miyaji. Miyagi. Miyagi.

912
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:07,730
Tomorrow morning?

913
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:09,611
10:00.

914
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:11,411
10:00.

915
00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:14,699
Oh, and...

916
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:19,784
Thanks for helping me out
with my friends out there.

917
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:34,845
Hey, good morning, Mr. miyagi.

918
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:36,550
Oh, good morning, Daniel-San.

919
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:37,760
How you feel this morning?

920
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:38,935
I'm a little sore, really.

921
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:40,023
Huh.

922
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:42,223
You know how drive?

923
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:44,149
Yeah, yeah, I do, really.

924
00:47:45,488 --> 00:47:48,070
No, no, no, I'm not...
I'm not very good at it, Mr. miyagi.

925
00:47:48,157 --> 00:47:49,567
Me, neither.

926
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:51,774
Well, I really don't have a license.

927
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:53,200
Me, neither.

928
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,535
All right. I guess it's okay, then.

929
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:05,583
1! All: Kill!

930
00:48:34,537 --> 00:48:36,994
You lose concentration in a fight,
and you're dead meat.

931
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:38,287
Yes, sensei. “What?

932
00:48:38,374 --> 00:48:39,705
Yes, sensei!

933
00:48:41,127 --> 00:48:42,287
Get up.

934
00:48:44,213 --> 00:48:46,579
Give me 60 pushups on your knuckles.

935
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:52,217
Combat!

936
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:53,304
Hai!

937
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:00,270
Hai!

938
00:49:02,398 --> 00:49:04,059
Brown, robertson.

939
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:16,529
En garde!

940
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:18,288
Hai!

941
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:23,665
Point. Front kick.

942
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:25,538
What are you looking at? Finish him!

943
00:49:28,257 --> 00:49:29,417
Return.

944
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:33,717
Prepare.

945
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:35,096
Hai!

946
00:49:37,433 --> 00:49:40,800
We do not train to be merciful here.
Mercy is for the weak.

947
00:49:41,604 --> 00:49:44,391
Here, on the street, in competition,

948
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:46,518
a man confronts you, he is the enemy.

949
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:48,395
An enemy deserves no mercy.

950
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:50,192
What is the problem, Mr. Lawrence?

951
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:55,439
Come on, let's forget this.

952
00:49:56,285 --> 00:49:58,321
Wait. Not yet.

953
00:50:00,456 --> 00:50:03,744
Class, we have visitors.
Fall in behind me. Hail

954
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:13,924
I hear you jumped
some of my students last night.

955
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:16,377
Afraid the facts mixed up.

956
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:18,633
Are you calling Mr. Lawrence a liar?

957
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:20,680
No call no one nothing.

958
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:23,179
What are you here for, old man?

959
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:25,386
Come ask leave boy alone.

960
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,977
What's the matter? The boy
can't take care of his own problems?

961
00:50:29,068 --> 00:50:30,979
One-to-one problem, yes.

962
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:34,729
Five-to-one problem,
too much ask anyone.

963
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:37,405
Is that what's bothering you? The odds?

964
00:50:37,493 --> 00:50:38,824
Well, we can fix that.

965
00:50:39,662 --> 00:50:41,198
Feel like matching, Mr. Lawrence?

966
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:42,288
Yes, sensei!

967
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:43,704
No more fighting.

968
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:46,077
This is a karate dojo,
not a knitting class.

969
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:50,081
You don't come in my dojo
and drop a challenge and leave, old man.

970
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:53,460
Now, get your boy on the mat,
or you and I will have a major problem.

971
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:56,258
Too much advantage, your dojo.

972
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,136
Name a place.

973
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:01,088
Tournament.

974
00:51:05,688 --> 00:51:08,930
You got real nerve, old man. Real nerve.

975
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:12,144
But I think we can accommodate you.

976
00:51:12,653 --> 00:51:14,518
Can't we, Mr. Lawrence?

977
00:51:14,697 --> 00:51:16,062
Yes, sensei.

978
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:18,071
Fall in.

979
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:25,362
Ask one more small request.

980
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:27,284
Make it fast.

981
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:30,327
Ask leave boy alone to train.

982
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:34,205
You're a pushy little bastard,
ain't you?

983
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,416
But I like that. I like that.

984
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:42,551
All right. No one touches
the prima Donna until the tournament.

985
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:44,806
Is that understood?

986
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:46,429
All: Yes, sensei!

987
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,016
But you don't show,

988
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:53,557
and it's open season

989
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:56,568
on him

990
00:51:58,449 --> 00:51:59,689
and you.

991
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:27,599
I can't believe this.

992
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:29,685
I cannot believe this.

993
00:52:29,772 --> 00:52:30,772
What?

994
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:32,596
- What you just got me into in there.
- Huh?

995
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:34,252
You said you were gonna
make things better for me.

996
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:35,311
That I did.

997
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:36,437
How?

998
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:40,066
How? Just save you two-month beating.

999
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:42,030
Oh, great. I can't wait.

1000
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:43,917
Now I really got something
to look forward to.

1001
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:51,119
Daniel: How much longer
till we get to your house?

1002
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:53,576
Miyagi: Hmm, other side tracks.

1003
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:55,871
What, are you...
What, are you in the oil business, too?

1004
00:52:56,965 --> 00:52:59,502
Not everything is as seem.

1005
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:02,255
This place reminds me of Newark.
What are we gonna do here?

1006
00:53:02,346 --> 00:53:04,007
Start training.

1007
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:05,713
Much work to be done.

1008
00:53:05,808 --> 00:53:08,345
Tournament here before you know it.

1009
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:10,175
Yeah. That's what I'm afraid of.

1010
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:16,288
Daniel: Man, that teacher
was really wacko.

1011
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:18,755
You really think
I'm gonna beat that guy?

1012
00:53:18,779 --> 00:53:19,814
Ah, no matter.

1013
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:23,568
Wacko teacher attitude rest in fist.

1014
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:27,743
Stupid, but fact of life.
Win, lose, no matter.

1015
00:53:27,955 --> 00:53:30,788
You make good fight. Earn respect.

1016
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:32,573
Then nobody bother.

1017
00:53:32,668 --> 00:53:34,454
Hell, they'll bury me where I fall.

1018
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:37,711
Either way, problem solved.

1019
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,955
Wait right here.

1020
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:49,802
This is great.

1021
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:57,184
Miyagi: Hey!

1022
00:53:57,818 --> 00:54:00,355
Oh, Mr. miyagi, I forgot to give
this back to you last night.

1023
00:54:00,446 --> 00:54:01,731
No, no, no, you keep.

1024
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:02,982
Oh, thanks a lot.

1025
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,438
So, ready?

1026
00:54:05,117 --> 00:54:06,732
Yeah, I guess so.

1027
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:11,653
Daniel-San, must talk.

1028
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:15,620
Walk on road, hmm.

1029
00:54:16,128 --> 00:54:20,337
Walk right side, safe.
Walk left side, safe.

1030
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:23,416
Walk middle, sooner or later,

1031
00:54:24,845 --> 00:54:26,801
get squished just like grape.

1032
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:31,473
Here karate, same thing.
Either you karate do, yes,

1033
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:33,805
or karate do, no.

1034
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,436
You karate do, "guess so."

1035
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:39,230
Just like grape.

1036
00:54:40,194 --> 00:54:41,559
Understand?

1037
00:54:42,863 --> 00:54:44,399
Yeah, I understand.

1038
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:46,981
Now ready?

1039
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:49,574
Yeah, I'm ready.

1040
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:50,863
Yes.

1041
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:55,781
Must make sacred pact.

1042
00:54:57,252 --> 00:55:01,120
I promise to teach karate. That my part.

1043
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:03,918
You promise learn.

1044
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:07,717
I say, you do. No question.

1045
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:09,878
That your part.

1046
00:55:11,183 --> 00:55:12,263
Deal?

1047
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,216
It's a deal.

1048
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:15,346
Yes.

1049
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:23,476
First, wash all the car.
Then wax. Wax...

1050
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:25,686
- Why do I have to wash all the car...
- Uh, uh, uh.

1051
00:55:25,781 --> 00:55:28,147
Remember deal. No question.

1052
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:29,903
- Yeah, but I...
- Right!

1053
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:35,825
Wax on, right hand.
Wax off, left hand.

1054
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:39,283
Wax on. Wax off.

1055
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:42,745
Breathe in through nose, out the mouth.

1056
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:47,003
Wax on, wax off.

1057
00:55:47,094 --> 00:55:49,756
Don't forget to breathe. Very important.

1058
00:55:50,097 --> 00:55:52,679
Wax on, wax off.

1059
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,682
Wax on, wax off.

1060
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:57,384
Hey, where did these cars come from?

1061
00:55:57,479 --> 00:56:00,721
Wax on... Detroit. Wax off.

1062
00:56:01,525 --> 00:56:04,688
Wax on. Wax off.

1063
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:18,200
No, no, no.

1064
00:56:18,584 --> 00:56:22,452
Wax on. Right hand, make circle.

1065
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:26,001
Wax off. Left hand, circle.

1066
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:28,924
Wax on. Wax off.

1067
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:32,177
Breathe in. Breathe out.

1068
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:35,305
Wax on. Wax off.

1069
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:37,011
Ah.

1070
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:39,639
Wax on. Wax off.

1071
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:43,188
Wax on. Wax off.

1072
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:10,961
Hey, Mr. miyagi, I'm finished.

1073
00:57:12,346 --> 00:57:14,337
Hey, you want to check these out?

1074
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:16,839
Mr. miyagi?

1075
00:57:19,061 --> 00:57:20,221
Mr. miyagi?

1076
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:25,104
Mr. miyagi?

1077
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:28,517
Hello?

1078
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:30,978
Mr...

1079
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,627
Hey, there you are. I've been
looking all over for you today.

1080
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:08,651
Where you been?

1081
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:09,770
I don't believe it.

1082
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:11,601
What? Hey, where are you going?

1083
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:14,021
I'm gonna go find that idiot, Daniel.
It's gonna stop.

1084
00:58:14,116 --> 00:58:15,822
No, relax,
everything's been taken care of.

1085
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:16,970
Oh, yeah. Until next time, huh?

1086
00:58:16,994 --> 00:58:18,655
No, there isn't gonna be a next time.

1087
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:19,745
There they are.

1088
00:58:19,997 --> 00:58:21,908
What? All right. Watch this.

1089
00:58:21,999 --> 00:58:24,240
Hey, you guys.
How you doing? It's good to see you.

1090
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:27,246
Hey, sorry about the eye there, Johnny.
Your shoulder okay, Tommy?

1091
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:29,023
You guys be careful
not to go step in front of

1092
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:30,662
any more buses now, all right?

1093
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:33,290
Hold it. Remember what sensei said?

1094
00:58:33,385 --> 00:58:34,841
You got to wait for the tournament.

1095
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:37,294
Must be take-a-worm-for-a-walk week!

1096
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:41,131
You did all that damage?

1097
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:44,309
Like, you know, when you make a wish
in a shower it always comes true?

1098
00:58:44,396 --> 00:58:45,727
I should have kept my mouth shut.

1099
00:58:45,814 --> 00:58:47,600
No, no, no. We got an agreement.

1100
00:58:47,691 --> 00:58:49,272
Oh, yeah? What's that?

1101
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,270
Well, they agreed not to beat up on me,

1102
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:53,401
and I promised
not to get my blood on their clothes.

1103
00:58:53,447 --> 00:58:54,482
That was it.

1104
00:58:54,573 --> 00:58:56,029
I don't believe you.

1105
00:58:56,116 --> 00:58:57,572
What am I gonna do, moan and groan?

1106
00:58:57,659 --> 00:58:59,024
Well, anybody else would.

1107
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:01,155
Yeah, who'd listen anyway?

1108
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:02,361
Me.

1109
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:05,159
Oh, really?

1110
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:09,039
You feel like listening
this Saturday night then?

1111
00:59:09,296 --> 00:59:10,331
Sure.

1112
00:59:10,422 --> 00:59:11,628
All right, great.

1113
00:59:11,715 --> 00:59:13,776
Great. So Saturday night,
we'll go out, we'll have a good time,

1114
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:17,088
we'll do whatever and, uh...

1115
00:59:17,179 --> 00:59:18,669
What is that, your address?

1116
00:59:18,764 --> 00:59:19,764
You got it.

1117
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:22,374
- Here you go.
- Now, where is this?

1118
00:59:23,351 --> 00:59:25,387
- I got to go.
- Okay.

1119
00:59:25,479 --> 00:59:27,219
All right. I'll talk to you later, then.

1120
00:59:27,314 --> 00:59:28,554
All right, great.

1121
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:30,313
All right!

1122
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:35,811
Hey, Mr. Harris,
can I talk to you for a second?

1123
00:59:35,906 --> 00:59:37,546
Yeah. Larusso,
third period history class.

1124
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:38,574
Oh, yes.

1125
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:39,761
Yeah. I wanted to let you know

1126
00:59:39,785 --> 00:59:41,429
I really got a lot
out of the lecture the other day

1127
00:59:41,453 --> 00:59:43,556
about how the Indian
got the horse. It was really great.

1128
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:44,695
That's nice to hear.

1129
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:47,143
Yeah. I was telling my buddies about it,
but I kind of messed it up.

1130
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:49,395
So I was wondering if you could give us
a quick review on it now.

1131
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:50,659
Oh, sure, I'm free this period.

1132
00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:51,994
Well, that's great for me then.

1133
00:59:52,089 --> 00:59:54,045
All: I got to go.

1134
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:56,288
That leaves you and me, larusso,

1135
00:59:56,343 --> 00:59:58,504
but that's all right.
I'll explain it to you,

1136
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:00,961
and you can pass
the information on to your friends.

1137
01:00:01,056 --> 01:00:02,296
Now the plains Indians

1138
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:05,632
were a very primitive tribe
all over north America...

1139
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:20,860
Come on, Casanova.

1140
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:48,185
Hi.

1141
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:49,555
Hi, how're you doing?

1142
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:50,681
Good.

1143
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:51,978
You look nice.

1144
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:53,180
Thank you.

1145
01:00:53,275 --> 01:00:55,015
Hey, you got company here.
I don't know...

1146
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:56,691
Oh, those are my parents.

1147
01:00:56,778 --> 01:00:58,564
Come on, come on.
I want you to meet them.

1148
01:00:58,655 --> 01:00:59,861
Oh, great.

1149
01:01:00,532 --> 01:01:01,532
Hello, sweetheart.

1150
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:02,651
Hey, dad.

1151
01:01:02,742 --> 01:01:04,573
Mom and dad, this is Daniel larusso.

1152
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:06,777
And these are my parents,
Mr. and Mrs. mills.

1153
01:01:06,872 --> 01:01:08,112
How do you do, Daniel?

1154
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:09,206
Hi.

1155
01:01:09,291 --> 01:01:10,291
Hello, Daniel.

1156
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:11,375
Nice to meet you.

1157
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:12,665
Where are you going, honey?

1158
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:14,288
Oh, I don't know. Where are we going?

1159
01:01:14,379 --> 01:01:16,244
I don't know. Wherever you want to go.

1160
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:17,374
Golf n' stuff?

1161
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:20,207
All right, I guess we're going
to golf n' stuff then.

1162
01:01:20,302 --> 01:01:22,088
Oh, don't worry about that.

1163
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:23,614
I thought you were
gonna have that fixed?

1164
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:25,174
I am. I was. I will.

1165
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:27,263
You live in encino, Daniel?

1166
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:29,432
What? Encino? No.

1167
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:31,768
Where do you live?

1168
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:35,063
Out in, like, reseda, you know.

1169
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:37,648
And that's your mother?

1170
01:01:37,736 --> 01:01:39,442
Yeah, yeah, that's her.

1171
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:40,779
Hi!

1172
01:01:40,864 --> 01:01:43,401
She's waiting for us now.
We better get going.

1173
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:44,526
It's nice to meet you.

1174
01:01:44,618 --> 01:01:45,653
Not too late, sweetheart.

1175
01:01:45,744 --> 01:01:46,984
Okay, dad.

1176
01:01:48,288 --> 01:01:49,744
Daniel: I feel like an idiot.

1177
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:54,123
- Hi, Mrs. larusso. I'm Ali.
- Hi.

1178
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:56,293
Hi, Ali. Call me Lucille.

1179
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:57,379
Okay.

1180
01:01:57,464 --> 01:01:59,250
That's a beautiful house you have.

1181
01:01:59,341 --> 01:02:00,501
Oh, thanks.

1182
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:08,088
Can you drive a stick?

1183
01:02:08,183 --> 01:02:09,218
Yeah.

1184
01:02:09,309 --> 01:02:11,766
Good. Put it into second. Let it roll.

1185
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:13,844
When I say "pop it," pop it.

1186
01:02:13,939 --> 01:02:15,224
- Pop it.
- All right.

1187
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:22,769
Don't worry, it's all under control.

1188
01:02:23,323 --> 01:02:24,654
She's cute.

1189
01:02:24,908 --> 01:02:26,273
Happens all the time.

1190
01:02:26,785 --> 01:02:31,074
Lucille: Okay, larusso!
Push! On, you huskies!

1191
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:32,904
Okay, pop it!

1192
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:36,286
Oh-ho! We got it, larusso!

1193
01:02:54,688 --> 01:02:57,270
Lucille: I'll pick you up at 11:00.
Please don't be late.

1194
01:02:57,357 --> 01:02:58,517
- All right, mom.
- Have fun.

1195
01:02:58,608 --> 01:02:59,688
Thanks.

1196
01:03:02,404 --> 01:03:04,235
Hey, look at that slide, huh?

1197
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:06,278
Yeah. We'll come back
and do that next time.

1198
01:03:06,366 --> 01:03:07,776
Come on.

1199
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:09,107
Hey, why next time?

1200
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:11,067
'Cause we need bathing suits.

1201
01:03:11,371 --> 01:03:13,783
Oh, yeah. Bathing suits.

1202
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:15,579
Do you play hockey?

1203
01:03:15,667 --> 01:03:17,532
Oh, well, you know, not professionally.

1204
01:03:18,837 --> 01:03:22,625
I need a picture to remember this by

1205
01:03:22,716 --> 01:03:26,254
'cause memories can die so fast

1206
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:30,132
it doesn't have to be a daydream

1207
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:33,841
we started something that can last

1208
01:03:33,935 --> 01:03:36,221
can you feel the night

1209
01:03:36,313 --> 01:03:38,144
coming out of nowhere

1210
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:39,562
hold it tight

1211
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:42,140
and you will all be there

1212
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:44,021
breathing in the air

1213
01:03:44,112 --> 01:03:47,855
look it's everywhere,
it comes from all around

1214
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:51,658
I want to share it all with you

1215
01:03:51,745 --> 01:03:54,111
all with you

1216
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:56,912
taking what is so strong

1217
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,618
and all along together right

1218
01:04:00,712 --> 01:04:02,543
we'll reach it out

1219
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:06,714
to feel the night

1220
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:24,565
Man, this is the best time
I've had since I've been here.

1221
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:26,108
I guess we'll have to do it again.

1222
01:04:26,196 --> 01:04:27,902
Definitely.

1223
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:29,024
Eddie: Hey, good-looking.

1224
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:30,195
- Hi.
- How are you doing?

1225
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:31,819
Good. Wow, this is cool!

1226
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:33,390
Yeah, I just got it. You want a ride?

1227
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:34,818
Uh, maybe some other time. Okay.

1228
01:04:34,913 --> 01:04:35,948
Are you sure?

1229
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:38,121
Daniel, this is Eddie.
And Eddie, this is Daniel.

1230
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:39,664
- How you doing, Daniel?
- Okay.

1231
01:04:39,751 --> 01:04:42,163
Boy 1: Hey, Ali
boy 2: How's it going?

1232
01:04:43,797 --> 01:04:46,539
Come here. We're going over
the hill. You wanna come?

1233
01:04:46,633 --> 01:04:50,046
No, I don't think so.
You guys have a good time.

1234
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:51,501
Come on, we'll make room.

1235
01:04:51,596 --> 01:04:52,656
I'll call you tomorrow, okay?

1236
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,011
Your little friend can come, too,

1237
01:04:54,099 --> 01:04:55,430
if it's okay with his mommy.

1238
01:04:55,517 --> 01:04:57,178
Lucille: Hi, kids.

1239
01:04:57,268 --> 01:04:59,429
Boy: Hey, mommy,
can Daniel come for a ride?

1240
01:04:59,521 --> 01:05:01,637
I really like your car, Mrs. larusso.

1241
01:05:10,490 --> 01:05:11,900
You know, you could have gone.

1242
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:13,606
Well, I didn't want to, okay?

1243
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:16,317
It's no big deal.

1244
01:05:16,413 --> 01:05:19,530
Look, Daniel, if I really
wanted to go, I would have.

1245
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:20,830
Makes no difference to me.

1246
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:22,578
Do what you want to do. I don't care.

1247
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:56,691
Wow, this is beautiful.

1248
01:06:00,915 --> 01:06:04,203
Hey, Mr. miyagi. This is great, man.

1249
01:06:04,419 --> 01:06:05,955
You got real fish in there.

1250
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:10,246
This is outrageous.

1251
01:06:11,342 --> 01:06:13,799
And I thought chung Lee's
Chinese restaurant was nice.

1252
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:15,593
You beat his act.

1253

Look at this. This is paradise.

1254
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:18,429
Did you do this yourself?

1255
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:19,722
Mmm-hmm.

1256
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:21,549
Are these bongos?

1257
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:23,843
Hey, I got it. I got it. I got it.

1263
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:35,772
Funny you should ask.

01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:43,450
Left circle...

1266
01:06:44,459 --> 01:06:46,199
Wouldn't it be easier
going back and forth?

1267
01:06:46,294 --> 01:06:48,535
Hey, hey, hey, but you go circle.

Good.

1287
01:08:02,453 --> 01:08:05,786
Go home. Get rest. Come morning.

1288
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:08,160
Start early. 6:00.

1289
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:00,049
Hey, wouldn't a fly swatter be easier?

1290
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:04,053
Man who catch fly with chopstick,

1291
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:06,297
accomplish anything.

1292
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:09,554
You ever catch one?

1293
01:09:10,063 --> 01:09:11,394
Not yet.

1294
01:09:14,567 --> 01:09:16,023
Can I try?

1295
01:09:16,444 --> 01:09:18,810

Hey, I guess that means I can
accomplish anything, huh, Mr. miyagi?

1301
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:02,197
Right.

1302
01:10:02,281 --> 01:10:03,281
No sweat.

Hmm. Both side?

1339
01:12:24,882 --> 01:12:26,122
Not yet.

1340
01:12:42,275 --> 01:12:45,517
Ha, Daniel-San, very good job.

1341
01:12:47,446 --> 01:12:49,437
Come morning. Start early.

1342
01:13:02,837 --> 01:13:05,749
Miyagi: Up! Down!

1343
01:13:06,549 --> 01:13:09,416

01:13:38,831 --> 01:13:41,413
Damn it! I don't believe this.

1345
01:14:01,395 --> 01:14:03,226
Oh! Missed spot.

1346
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:05,146
What spot?

1347
01:14:05,483 --> 01:14:07,895
Hey, hey, how come you didn't tell me
you were going fishing?

1348
01:14:07,985 --> 01:14:09,395
You not here when I go.

1349
01:14:09,487 --> 01:14:11,694
Maybe I would've wanted to go.
You ever think of that?

1350
01:14:11,864 --> 01:14:13,195
You karate training.

1351
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:16,115
I'm what? I'm being your goddamn slave,

1352
01:14:16,202 --> 01:14:17,567
We made a deal here.

1353
01:14:17,662 --> 01:14:18,742
S07? So?

1354
01:14:18,829 --> 01:14:21,366
So you're supposed to teach
and I'm supposed to learn, remember?

1355
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:24,417
For four days I've been busting my ass
and haven't learned a goddamn thing!

1356
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:25,745
Ah, you learned plenty.

1357
01:14:25,836 --> 01:14:27,981
I learned plenty. I learned
how to sand your decks, maybe,

1358
01:14:28,005 --> 01:14:29,586
how to wax your car, paint your house,

1359
01:14:29,674 --> 01:14:31,380
paint your fence.
I learned plenty. Right!

1360
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:33,378
Ah, not everything is as seem.

1361
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:35,425
Oh, bullshit! I'm going home, man.

1362
01:14:36,138 --> 01:14:38,049
Daniel-San. Daniel-San!

1363
01:14:38,849 --> 01:14:39,884

1364
01:14:39,976 --> 01:14:41,182
Come here.

01:14:46,607 --> 01:14:48,939
Show me sand the floor.

1366
01:14:49,026 --> 01:14:50,982
I can't move my arm, all right?

1367
01:14:56,075 --> 01:14:58,532
What're you doing? What you...

1368
01:15:02,623 --> 01:15:04,238
Ow! What're you doin'?

Sand the floor.

01:15:58,846 --> 01:15:59,961
Concentrate.

1387
01:16:00,056 --> 01:16:03,765
Look in my eye. Lock hand. Thumb inside.

1388
01:16:04,185 --> 01:16:07,598
Wax on. Wax off.

1389

01:18:29,496 --> 01:18:30,906
Learn balance.

1407
01:20:14,018 --> 01:20:16,760
What was that you were doing
on those stumps over there?

1408
01:20:16,854 --> 01:20:18,560
Called crane technique.

1409
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:19,932
Does it work?

1410
01:20:20,274 --> 01:20:22,765
If do right, no can defense.

1411
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:24,270
Could you teach me?

1412
01:20:24,361 --> 01:20:27,103
Ah, first learn stand, then learn fly.

1413
01:20:27,197 --> 01:20:28,197
Yeah.

1414
01:20:28,282 --> 01:20:30,648
Nature rule, Daniel-San. Not mine.

1415
01:20:30,743 --> 01:20:32,279
Where'd you learn it from?

1416
01:20:32,369 --> 01:20:33,825
Father teach.

1417
01:20:33,912 --> 01:20:35,777
Ha, you must have had some father, man.

01:20:35,873 --> 01:20:37,204
Oh, yes.

1419
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:39,907
Man 1: Hey, look,

Uh, excuse, please.

1422
01:20:44,214 --> 01:20:48,298
Boy cold. Must leave.
Kindly remove bottle.

1423
01:20:52,264 --> 01:20:55,222
Kindly do it yourself, Mr. moto.

1424
01:21:06,236 --> 01:21:08,443
How did you do that?
How did you do that?

1425
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:11,237
Don't know. First time.

1426
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:18,695
Daniel: Hey, you. Oh, no.

1427
01:21:19,917 --> 01:21:22,249
Boy: Hey, hey, hey, all right!

Hey, not bad.

01:21:30,094 --> 01:21:31,334
You let me.

Hey, you know, I was gonna call you

1432
01:21:33,806 --> 01:21:35,171
You up for it? Yeah.

1433
01:21:35,265 --> 01:21:37,176
Yeah? Great.
I'll pick you up by about 7:00?

1434
01:21:37,267 --> 01:21:40,725
Oh, I'm having dinner
with my parents at their country club.

1435
01:21:40,813 --> 01:21:43,475
But I'll be done by 9:30.
Meet me out front.

1436
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:44,805
Is that cool? Yeah.

1437
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:46,856
Alan: Hey, Johnny. Johnny, over here.

1438
01:21:47,945 --> 01:21:48,945
What's the matter?

1439
01:21:49,029 --> 01:21:50,644
I'm just hearing
that little voice again.

1440
01:21:50,739 --> 01:21:52,354
Yeah? Pretend you're deaf.

1441
01:21:52,449 --> 01:21:54,280
Encino oaks country club, 9:30.

1442
01:21:54,368 --> 01:21:55,448
Uh, Friday? Yeah.

1443
01:21:55,536 --> 01:21:57,197
- Great.
- Way to go, buttertoes.

1444
01:21:57,287 --> 01:21:58,993
- Hi, Ali.
- Hi, Alan.

1445
01:21:59,665 --> 01:22:01,155
I got to be nuts.

1446
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:18,468
Okay. Here. Stop. Throw anchor.

1447
01:22:25,065 --> 01:22:26,851
Ha, good. Stand bow.

1448
01:22:29,695 --> 01:22:31,981
Ah, no, no, not bow. Bow.

1449
01:22:32,865 --> 01:22:33,900
Up!

1450
01:22:33,991 --> 01:22:35,697
What, up front? Yeah.

1451
01:22:35,993 --> 01:22:39,952
Make rock. Left, right. Up, down.

1452
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:44,373
Side, side. Breathe in. Breathe out.

1453
01:22:45,919 --> 01:22:47,375
No scare fish.

1454
01:22:52,509 --> 01:22:54,215
Hey, when am I gonna learn how to punch?

1455
01:22:55,304 --> 01:22:58,922
Better learn balance. Balance is key.

1456
01:22:59,808 --> 01:23:02,265
Balance good, karate good.

1457
01:23:02,352 --> 01:23:03,933
Everything good.

1458
01:23:04,021 --> 01:23:08,685
Balance bad, better pack up,
go home. Understand?

1459
01:23:09,943 --> 01:23:11,524
Yeah, I understand.

1460
01:23:16,116 --> 01:23:18,573
Hey, you ever get into fights
when you were a kid?

1461
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:20,025
Oh, plenty.

1462
01:23:23,123 --> 01:23:25,865
Why? Fighting, fighting. Same, same.

1463
01:23:25,959 --> 01:23:27,870
Yeah, but you knew karate.

1464
01:23:28,212 --> 01:23:30,749
Someone always know more.

1465
01:23:31,757 --> 01:23:34,544
You mean, there were times
when you were scared to fight?

1466
01:23:35,219 --> 01:23:39,337
Ah, always scared. Miyagi hate fighting.

1467
01:23:40,057 --> 01:23:41,968
Yeah, but you like karate.

1468
01:23:42,059 --> 01:23:43,265
So?

1469
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:46,055
So karate's fighting.
You train to fight.

1470
01:23:48,065 --> 01:23:49,726
That what you think?

1471
01:23:53,612 --> 01:23:54,612
No.

1472
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:56,770
Then why train?

1473
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:00,774
So I won't have to fight.

1474
01:24:02,746 --> 01:24:04,657
Miyagi have hope for you.

1475
01:24:05,374 --> 01:24:07,035
When am I gonna learn how to punch?

1476
01:24:07,125 --> 01:24:08,740
Learn how punch

1477
01:24:08,835 --> 01:24:10,496
when learn how keep dry!

1478
01:24:10,587 --> 01:24:11,622
No! No!

1479
01:24:15,842 --> 01:24:18,504
Daniel-San, you all wet behind ear!

1480
01:24:18,595 --> 01:24:20,677
What are you, crazy?

1481
01:24:22,099 --> 01:24:23,555
You're crazy!

1482
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:46,786
Trouble with Johnny?

1483
01:24:47,165 --> 01:24:49,030
You two lovebirds having problems?

1484
01:24:49,126 --> 01:24:51,742
Dad, we're not lovebirds.
Hey, dad, what time is it?

1485
01:24:51,837 --> 01:24:54,829
Well, it's about 9:40.

1486
01:24:55,966 --> 01:24:57,797
Um, I got to go.

1487
01:24:57,884 --> 01:24:59,465
You have a date?

1488
01:24:59,803 --> 01:25:01,009
Uh...

1489
01:25:02,139 --> 01:25:03,470
With whom?

1490
01:25:03,557 --> 01:25:04,557
Dad, it's a friend.

1491
01:25:04,641 --> 01:25:06,552
Not that boy from reseda.

1492
01:25:07,019 --> 01:25:08,850
Yeah, he's from reseda.

1493
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:11,311
He's a nice guy. It's no big deal.

1494
01:25:11,398 --> 01:25:15,186
Honey, you've monopolized
the best-looking man here long enough.

1495
01:25:15,777 --> 01:25:16,777
Hi.

1496
01:25:17,237 --> 01:25:18,317
Hi.

1497
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:21,355
Listen, I've been thinking.

1498
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:23,781
Maybe we can call a truce.

1499
01:25:23,869 --> 01:25:26,235
Yeah. I'm not at war. Excuse me.

1500
01:25:26,330 --> 01:25:29,037
Uh, could we please finish the dance?

1501
01:26:32,646 --> 01:26:34,136
Don't you ever do that to me again!

1502
01:27:27,701 --> 01:27:29,487
Hey, I didn't know you were a singer.

1503
01:27:29,578 --> 01:27:30,680
How're you doing, Mr. miyagi?

1504
01:27:30,704 --> 01:27:33,070
Oh, Daniel-San. Daniel-San.

1505
01:27:33,749 --> 01:27:35,364
Come inside. Come inside.

1506
01:27:36,376 --> 01:27:38,116
What's that song you were singing there?

1507
01:27:38,211 --> 01:27:39,872
Japanese blues.

1508
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:55,175
Banzai!

1509
01:27:56,646 --> 01:27:57,931
To baby trees.

1510
01:27:59,441 --> 01:28:02,604
Ah! Bonsai. Banzai!

1511
01:28:03,653 --> 01:28:04,813
Bonsai.

1512
01:28:05,572 --> 01:28:07,483
Banzai!

1513
01:28:08,617 --> 01:28:09,902
Bonsai!

1514
01:28:09,993 --> 01:28:10,993
Ah, close enough.

1515
01:28:11,995 --> 01:28:13,155
Ah.

1516
01:28:24,382 --> 01:28:26,623
What are we celebrating here?

1517
01:28:26,885 --> 01:28:28,216
Anniversary.

1518
01:28:28,804 --> 01:28:30,669
Whose anniversary?

1519
01:28:32,808 --> 01:28:34,298
- Is this your wife?
- Hmm.

1520
01:28:34,392 --> 01:28:36,132
I didn't know you were married.

1521
01:28:36,228 --> 01:28:39,766
Ah. Damn beautiful, don't you think?

1522
01:28:39,856 --> 01:28:41,346
Yeah, she's pretty.

1523
01:28:42,984 --> 01:28:45,350
Oh, first time I saw her

1524
01:28:46,363 --> 01:28:49,730
was cane field, Hawaii.

1525
01:28:51,034 --> 01:28:52,365
Beautiful.

1526
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:57,533
Damn good cane cutter, too. Hmm.

1527
01:28:59,626 --> 01:29:00,911
Where 1s she now?

1528
01:29:02,963 --> 01:29:04,203
Need drink.

1529
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:16,006
Daniel-San. Huh.

1530
01:29:17,769 --> 01:29:19,225
Look. Look.

1531
01:29:19,729 --> 01:29:20,969
Hey, hey.

1532
01:29:24,317 --> 01:29:28,401

1533
01:29:34,744 --> 01:29:37,156
Hey. Drink. Drink!

1534
01:29:41,793 --> 01:29:43,579

Yes, sir.

1536
01:29:45,297 --> 01:29:49,757
Sergeant miyagi report to kill

1537
01:29:54,514 --> 01:29:56,345
Sergeant miyagi.

1538
01:29:56,558 --> 01:29:57,798
Yes, sir?

1539
01:29:58,435 --> 01:30:02,269
Regret to inform, wife, son,

1540
01:30:03,189 --> 01:30:06,101

1541
01:30:07,402 --> 01:30:10,485
Complication, but no doctor come.

1542
01:30:12,949 --> 01:30:15,782
Land of free, home of brave.

1543
01:30:15,952 --> 01:30:17,658
No doctor come.

1544
01:30:19,289 --> 01:30:21,450
No doctor come.

1545
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:38,843
Mr. miyagi. Mr. miyagi. Hey.

1546
01:30:40,894 --> 01:30:42,225
Hey, you okay?

"arising from childbirth."

1552

"Valor."

1553
01:34:11,187 --> 01:34:12,518
Daniel-San,

1554
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:18,191

01:34:18,653 --> 01:34:22,020
fit inside one inch. Here.

1556

Here. Now punch hard.

1558
01:34:31,457 --> 01:34:34,620
What's the matter?
You're some kind of girl or something?

1559
01:34:34,711 --> 01:34:36,576
Punch! Drive a punch!

1560
01:34:36,671 --> 01:34:38,957
Not just arm. Whole body.

1561
01:34:39,048 --> 01:34:40,504
Hip, leg. Drive a punch.

1562
01:34:43,595 --> 01:34:44,835
Give you power.

1563
01:34:44,929 --> 01:34:46,510
Now try punch.

1564
01:34:48,057 --> 01:34:49,297
Once more.

1565
01:34:51,144 --> 01:34:52,259
Once more.

1566
01:34:55,023 --> 01:34:56,388
Very good, Daniel-San.

1567
01:34:58,776 --> 01:35:00,516
Hey, pretty good, huh?

1568
01:35:01,070 --> 01:35:02,560
Look at this, Mr. miyagi.

1569
01:35:05,575 --> 01:35:07,190
Wait! Wait!

1570
01:35:10,872 --> 01:35:12,737
Hey, what do you think, Mr. miyagi, huh?

1571
01:35:15,084 --> 01:35:16,665
I tell you what miyagi think.

1572
01:35:16,753 --> 01:35:18,289
I think you dance around too much.

1573
01:35:18,379 --> 01:35:19,994
I think you talk too much.

1574
01:35:20,089 --> 01:35:22,000
I think you not concentrate enough.

1575
01:35:22,091 --> 01:35:23,171
Lots of work to be done.

1576
01:35:23,259 --> 01:35:24,840
Tournament just around the corner.

1577
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:26,464
Come, stand up.

1578
01:35:27,055 --> 01:35:30,889
Now, ready. Concentrate. Focus power.

1579
01:35:36,773 --> 01:35:37,773
Drive a punch.

1580
01:35:38,942 --> 01:35:40,853
Drive a punch, Daniel-San.

1581
01:35:43,488 --> 01:35:47,151
Miyagi: Happy birthday to you

1582
01:35:48,409 --> 01:35:52,698
happy birthday to you

1583
01:35:53,456 --> 01:35:57,995
happy birthday, dear Daniel-San

1584
01:35:59,128 --> 01:36:03,212
happy birthday to you

1585
01:36:05,301 --> 01:36:06,791
uh, make wish.

1586
01:36:07,512 --> 01:36:10,800
Oh, well, I know what I'm wishing for.

1587
01:36:13,977 --> 01:36:16,434
Ah, very good! Very good!

1588
01:36:17,188 --> 01:36:18,803
Daniel-San, ha.

1589
01:36:20,066 --> 01:36:21,226
Ah.

1590
01:36:22,318 --> 01:36:24,434
Number one birthday present.

1591
01:36:24,654 --> 01:36:26,690
Oh, Mr. miyagi, what did you do?

1592
01:36:26,781 --> 01:36:28,646
You didn't have to do this.

1593
01:36:28,741 --> 01:36:31,073
What is this? I have no idea.

1594
01:36:33,871 --> 01:36:36,032
Oh, Mr. miyagi, this is great.

1595
01:36:36,624 --> 01:36:38,114
This is great.

1596
01:36:40,003 --> 01:36:42,210
Hey, where'd this come from, anyway?

1597
01:36:42,422 --> 01:36:46,836
Mrs. miyagi make long time ago.

1598
01:36:49,846 --> 01:36:52,804
You know, if you ever want this,
um, this patch back,

1599
01:36:52,890 --> 01:36:54,346
I'll understand.

1600
01:36:55,184 --> 01:36:56,674
I know you understand.

1601
01:36:58,354 --> 01:36:59,560
Eh, try on.

1602
01:37:00,523 --> 01:37:04,186
All right. This is beautiful.
This is great.

1603
01:37:04,527 --> 01:37:07,519
So, you think I stand
a chance at the tournament?

1604
01:37:07,613 --> 01:37:09,604
Not matter what miyagi think.

1605
01:37:09,699 --> 01:37:10,905
Miyagi not fighting.

1606
01:37:12,410 --> 01:37:14,901
I just don't know
if I know enough karate.

1607
01:37:15,413 --> 01:37:16,869
Feeling correct.

1608
01:37:17,957 --> 01:37:20,790
Oh, you sure know
how to make a guy feel confident.

1609
01:37:20,877 --> 01:37:25,211
Daniel-San, you trust quality
what you know,

1610
01:37:25,381 --> 01:37:26,837
not quantity.

1611
01:37:28,634 --> 01:37:31,341
Hey, today you get driver license?

1612
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:35,046
Oh, yeah, yeah! Look.
Look at this. Look at this.

1613
01:37:35,224 --> 01:37:37,806
Ah, check that out. Check that out.

1614
01:37:38,436 --> 01:37:40,301
"Daniel larusso."

1615
01:37:42,357 --> 01:37:43,392
Congratulations.

1616
01:37:43,483 --> 01:37:45,724
Yeah, thanks. Kid's legal now, huh?

1617
01:37:46,402 --> 01:37:49,815
Hmm, I never know you have sweetheart.

1618
01:37:49,906 --> 01:37:51,237
Ah, no, no, I don't.

1619
01:37:51,324 --> 01:37:55,158
Look good together. Different, but same.

1620
01:37:56,245 --> 01:37:58,031
No, no, different, but different.

1621
01:37:58,122 --> 01:37:59,122
Hmm.

1622
01:37:59,749 --> 01:38:01,910
Ah, too bad mother not here.

1623
01:38:02,418 --> 01:38:05,160
Oh, shoot! Shoot! Damn.

1624
01:38:05,254 --> 01:38:06,254
What's the matter?

1625
01:38:06,339 --> 01:38:08,734
Mr. miyagi, I've got to go.
I was supposed to meet my mother.

1626
01:38:08,758 --> 01:38:10,518
She was going to make
a surprise cake for me.

1627
01:38:10,593 --> 01:38:11,708
Miyagi understand.

1628
01:38:11,803 --> 01:38:13,759
I wasn't supposed to
know about it. Damn it.

1629
01:38:13,846 --> 01:38:14,846
That's okay.

1630
01:38:14,931 --> 01:38:15,966
I'm sorry.

1631
01:38:16,057 --> 01:38:17,888
Miyagi once have mother, too.

1632
01:38:19,352 --> 01:38:21,308
Go outside. Something to show you.

1633
01:38:21,396 --> 01:38:23,352
- What?
- Number two present.

1634
01:38:23,439 --> 01:38:24,519
Daniel: Number two present?

1635
01:38:24,607 --> 01:38:26,752
Oh, no, Mr. miyagi, you don't
have to give me anything.

1636
01:38:26,776 --> 01:38:28,892
You've given me enough already.
I'm serious.

1637
01:38:28,986 --> 01:38:30,271
No, no, no, no.

1638
01:38:30,363 --> 01:38:31,944
No, really, I'm serious.

1639
01:38:33,157 --> 01:38:34,363
Choose.

1640
01:38:38,037 --> 01:38:40,699
Oh, no. No. No.

1641
01:38:41,207 --> 01:38:42,947
Hurt old man feeling.

1642
01:38:45,044 --> 01:38:46,044
Choose.

1643
01:38:46,129 --> 01:38:47,369
Oh, wow.

1644
01:38:51,134 --> 01:38:52,840
Oh, Mr. miyagi...

1645
01:38:57,932 --> 01:38:59,763
I can't believe it!

1646
01:39:00,393 --> 01:39:01,393
Oh.

1647
01:39:02,145 --> 01:39:05,308
Oh, wow, what a gift.

1648
01:39:15,616 --> 01:39:16,822
Oh, boy.

1649
01:39:20,997 --> 01:39:24,706
Just remember, license never replace

1650
01:39:25,001 --> 01:39:28,789
eye, ear, and brain.

1651
01:39:32,300 --> 01:39:34,666
Eh, what's the matter?

1652
01:39:35,970 --> 01:39:37,255
I'm just scared.

1653
01:39:37,346 --> 01:39:39,837
You know, the tournament and everything.

1654
01:39:41,767 --> 01:39:45,009
You remember lesson about balance?

1655
01:39:46,689 --> 01:39:47,689
Yeah.

1656
01:39:48,691 --> 01:39:52,183
Lesson not just karate only.

1657
01:39:53,863 --> 01:39:56,445
Lesson for whole life.

1658
01:39:58,326 --> 01:40:01,318
Whole life have a balance,

1659
01:40:03,664 --> 01:40:05,780
everything be better.

1660
01:40:08,878 --> 01:40:10,459
Understand?

1661
01:40:12,131 --> 01:40:13,871
Yeah, I understand.

1662
01:40:17,762 --> 01:40:19,252
Oh, wow!

1663
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:27,889
You're the best friend I ever had.

1664
01:40:29,982 --> 01:40:31,188
You

1665
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:34,225
pretty okay, too.

1666
01:40:37,865 --> 01:40:41,904
Hey, go. Go. Go. Go find the balance.

1667
01:40:43,621 --> 01:40:45,202
Okay.

1668
01:40:46,249 --> 01:40:47,364
All right.

1669
01:40:52,004 --> 01:40:53,335
Banzai, Daniel-San!

1670
01:40:53,422 --> 01:40:54,707
Hey, bonsai.

1671
01:40:55,383 --> 01:40:56,498
Banzai!

1672
01:40:56,592 --> 01:40:57,832
Bonsai!

1673
01:40:58,761 --> 01:41:00,922
- Banzai!
- Bonsail

1674
01:41:11,232 --> 01:41:13,894
Try to make it last

1675
01:41:15,653 --> 01:41:18,360
nothing you can do

1676
01:41:20,157 --> 01:41:22,899
in a photograph

1677
01:41:22,994 --> 01:41:26,407
the innocence you thought
you'd lost is staring back at you

1678
01:41:29,083 --> 01:41:31,916
young hearts beat fast

1679
01:41:32,003 --> 01:41:33,539
driving down the road

1680
01:41:33,629 --> 01:41:36,041
rubber, plastic, metal, glass

1681
01:41:36,132 --> 01:41:37,838
why did you have to go?

1682
01:41:37,925 --> 01:41:39,461
Young hearts die young

1683
01:41:40,678 --> 01:41:43,260
hey, you both, don't shoot! No! No! No!

1684
01:41:45,099 --> 01:41:46,577
Hey, don't leave me here. I'm wounded.

1685
01:41:46,601 --> 01:41:47,761
Good, maybe you'll die.

1686
01:41:50,313 --> 01:41:51,313
Hey!

1687
01:41:52,315 --> 01:41:54,055
I just wanted to apologize.

1688
01:41:54,150 --> 01:41:55,731
Fine. You apologized.

1689
01:41:56,319 --> 01:41:57,809
You know, I got my license.

1690
01:41:57,903 --> 01:41:59,234
Yeah? Whoop-de-do.

1691
01:41:59,322 --> 01:42:00,858
Hey, what's with you?

1692
01:42:00,948 --> 01:42:03,485
You expect me to do
cartwheels or something?

1693
01:42:04,118 --> 01:42:06,359
No, I just expect a little bit
of courtesy, maybe.

1694
01:42:06,454 --> 01:42:09,912
But I guess that's just for people with
fancy cars and things like that, right?

1695
01:42:09,999 --> 01:42:10,999
Right?

1696
01:42:12,001 --> 01:42:13,866
Hey, can't you take a hint?

1697
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:20,881
What's the matter? Truth hurt?

1698
01:42:20,968 --> 01:42:22,571
So, you really think that's if,
don't you?

1699
01:42:22,595 --> 01:42:24,573
- Yeah, I know that's it.
- Yeah, well, you're wrong.

1700
01:42:24,597 --> 01:42:25,757
Oh, I bet I'm wrong.

1701
01:42:25,848 --> 01:42:27,200
You know, Daniel,
I didn't go out with you

1702
01:42:27,224 --> 01:42:29,886
because of a car or where you live.

1703
01:42:29,977 --> 01:42:33,094
Okay, well, while you're on the subject,
why did you then?

1704
01:42:33,814 --> 01:42:35,179
Huh? Why did you?

1705
01:42:35,274 --> 01:42:38,562
Because I thought that maybe
you and me were different.

1706
01:42:38,653 --> 01:42:40,756
Yeah, we're different.
I'm from reseda, you're from the hills.

1707
01:42:40,780 --> 01:42:42,674
- That's how we're different.
- That's not what I mean.

1708
01:42:42,698 --> 01:42:45,861
Why don't you just admit that you can't
handle the situation the way it is then?

1709
01:42:45,951 --> 01:42:47,566
You know, I can handle it fine.

1710
01:42:47,662 --> 01:42:48,742
You can't.

1711
01:42:49,372 --> 01:42:50,657
What makes you so sensitive?

1712
01:42:50,748 --> 01:42:51,748
What?

1713
01:42:51,832 --> 01:42:53,435
She's never been anything
but nice to you.

1714
01:42:53,459 --> 01:42:55,854
Yeah, she was so nice she used me to
make what's his name jealous.

1715
01:42:55,878 --> 01:42:57,398
She doesn't even like what's his name.

1716
01:42:57,546 --> 01:42:59,024
I never could have guessed
the way their faces

1717
01:42:59,048 --> 01:43:00,484
were stuck together
at that country club.

1718
01:43:00,508 --> 01:43:02,123
Oh, that's right.

1719
01:43:02,218 --> 01:43:05,426
You didn't stick around
for the exciting conclusion.

1720
01:43:05,513 --> 01:43:07,032
Oh, what was that? His hand on her ass?

1721
01:43:07,056 --> 01:43:10,173
Her right hook. You think
she sprained her wrist doing her nails?

1722
01:43:12,687 --> 01:43:13,893
She hit him?

1723
01:43:13,979 --> 01:43:15,389
That's an understatement.

1724
01:43:17,942 --> 01:43:19,682
Why didn't she say something?

1725
01:43:19,777 --> 01:43:22,359
She shouldn't have to, should she?

1726
01:43:25,241 --> 01:43:27,823
Young hearts beat fast

1727
01:43:27,993 --> 01:43:29,654
driving down the road

1728
01:43:29,745 --> 01:43:32,327
rubber, plastic, metal, glass

1729
01:43:32,415 --> 01:43:34,155
why did you have to go?

1730
01:43:34,250 --> 01:43:36,912
Young hearts die young

1731
01:43:37,002 --> 01:43:40,620
when they are all alone
and there is no turning back now

1732
01:43:41,632 --> 01:43:42,997
hey, slugger.

1733
01:43:48,597 --> 01:43:50,133
Look, I'm a jerk.

1734
01:43:53,936 --> 01:43:55,301
You are a jerk.

1735
01:43:56,605 --> 01:43:58,266
So, am I forgiven?

1736
01:43:59,275 --> 01:44:01,357
Huh? Hey, I don't hear anything.

1737
01:44:02,653 --> 01:44:04,609
Hmm, sounds like a yes to me.

1738
01:44:04,989 --> 01:44:07,355
Come here. Come here.

1739
01:44:18,461 --> 01:44:21,328
So, I guess you know
about the tournament tomorrow.

1740
01:44:21,422 --> 01:44:22,787
Who doesn't?

1741
01:44:22,965 --> 01:44:24,501
Dumb move, huh?

1742
01:44:24,967 --> 01:44:26,582
Not necessarily.

1743
01:44:27,428 --> 01:44:29,419
I don't have much of a cheering section.

1744
01:44:30,222 --> 01:44:31,462
You got me.

1745
01:44:32,558 --> 01:44:35,800
Well, I'll probably get killed
in the first match, anyway.

1746
01:44:36,937 --> 01:44:38,427
So we'll leave early.

1747
01:44:53,704 --> 01:44:55,307
Hey, I got something to show you.
“What?

1748
01:44:55,331 --> 01:44:56,366
Come here. “What?

1749
01:44:56,457 --> 01:44:57,822
Come here. “What?

1750
01:45:00,878 --> 01:45:01,878
So, how do you like it?

1751
01:45:01,962 --> 01:45:02,962
- This is yours?
- Yep.

1752
01:45:03,047 --> 01:45:05,254
- Are you serious?
- Yep.

1753
01:45:05,341 --> 01:45:06,341
Ah, it's beautiful!

1754
01:45:06,425 --> 01:45:08,086
Yeah, it sure is, huh?

1755
01:45:08,177 --> 01:45:09,417
Oh, my god!

1756
01:45:09,512 --> 01:45:10,547
All right, here you go.

1757
01:45:10,638 --> 01:45:12,094
You want me to drive?

1758
01:45:12,181 --> 01:45:13,421
Hey, it's the '80s.

1759
01:45:13,516 --> 01:45:14,722
All right.

1760
01:45:14,809 --> 01:45:16,536
All right, now to start,
you push that button.

1761
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:17,720
Now put the key in there...

1762
01:45:17,812 --> 01:45:18,812
You're incredible.

1763
01:45:18,896 --> 01:45:20,290
Yeah, all right, now press the clutch.

1764
01:45:20,314 --> 01:45:21,554
Get the lights. Get the lights.

1765
01:45:21,607 --> 01:45:22,918
No, no, the other one.

1766
01:45:22,942 --> 01:45:25,604
Okay, good,
now to you and down is first.

1767
01:45:25,694 --> 01:45:26,979
Now you just let it out slow.

1768
01:45:27,071 --> 01:45:28,686
You'll be fine. All right.

1769
01:45:28,781 --> 01:45:30,191
Ali: Hold on!

1770
01:45:30,908 --> 01:45:33,615
This is awesome. This is really awesome.

1771
01:45:33,702 --> 01:45:34,862
How fast does it go?

1772
01:45:34,954 --> 01:45:36,114
Let's not find out.

1773
01:45:38,207 --> 01:45:39,538
Let's see... miyaji...

1774
01:45:39,625 --> 01:45:40,785
What belt are you?

1775
01:45:40,876 --> 01:45:42,787
- Belt?
- Why matter?

1776
01:45:42,878 --> 01:45:45,164
It's open division.
It's only for brown belt or above.

1777
01:45:45,256 --> 01:45:47,247
Oh, yeah. Boy black belt.

1778
01:45:47,883 --> 01:45:50,124
Okay. You better hustle.
They're starting.

1779
01:45:50,219 --> 01:45:52,335
Down the hall, to your left.

1780
01:45:52,805 --> 01:45:53,805
I'll see you inside.

1781
01:45:53,889 --> 01:45:54,969
Okay.

1782
01:45:55,808 --> 01:45:58,140
Uh, excuse me, Mr. referee.

1783
01:45:58,227 --> 01:46:01,310
This is not miyaji. Miyagi.

1784
01:46:01,397 --> 01:46:02,432
Miyagi?

1785
01:46:02,898 --> 01:46:04,638
Miyagi. Okay, thanks.

1786
01:46:04,733 --> 01:46:05,733
Thank you very much.

1787
01:46:13,742 --> 01:46:14,742
Well, well, well.

1788
01:46:14,827 --> 01:46:16,192
Look who we have here, fellows.

1789
01:46:16,287 --> 01:46:19,950
Our little friend, Danielle.
Hello, Danielle.

1790
01:46:20,291 --> 01:46:23,203
What's the matter?
Mommy not here to dress you?

1791
01:46:24,503 --> 01:46:26,084
Hey, I'm talking to you, punk.

1792
01:46:26,171 --> 01:46:27,911
Come on, come on, make a move!

1793
01:46:28,007 --> 01:46:30,794
Man: Hey, save it for the ring. Come on.

1794
01:46:31,844 --> 01:46:33,425
Boy: All right. Man: Let's go.

1795
01:46:34,471 --> 01:46:35,631
Come on.

1796
01:46:35,723 --> 01:46:37,554
You know, points or no points,

1797
01:46:39,101 --> 01:46:40,432
you're dead meat.

1798
01:46:41,228 --> 01:46:43,184
Man: I said, out!

1799
01:46:45,649 --> 01:46:46,980
Dead meat.

1800
01:46:50,946 --> 01:46:52,546
Bobby: Let it go.
I think he's gonna cry.

1801
01:47:03,667 --> 01:47:06,830
Male announcer: The winner of
the first match in the open division

1802
01:47:06,921 --> 01:47:09,003
is Lucas snyder.

1803
01:47:09,340 --> 01:47:10,546
Daniel: Hey, Mr. miyagi.

1804
01:47:10,633 --> 01:47:12,123
Hey, Daniel-San, hurry up. Come.

1805
01:47:12,217 --> 01:47:13,377
The tournament is starting.

1806
01:47:13,469 --> 01:47:14,629
Where did we get this?

1807
01:47:14,720 --> 01:47:16,085
Uh, Buddha provide.

1808
01:47:16,180 --> 01:47:18,617
Male announcer: Daniel larusso,
please report to ring three immediately.

1809
01:47:18,641 --> 01:47:19,676
Hey, where's ring three?

1810
01:47:19,767 --> 01:47:20,767
Over there.

1811
01:47:20,851 --> 01:47:23,538
Hold it! Hold it! Only teachers and
students on the competition floor.

1812
01:47:23,562 --> 01:47:24,677
I'm sorry.

1813
01:47:24,772 --> 01:47:26,353
Oh, well, he doesn't speak english,

1814
01:47:26,440 --> 01:47:28,440
and I can't understand
his instruction without her.

1815
01:47:28,525 --> 01:47:30,140
She's his, uh, translator.

1816
01:47:31,820 --> 01:47:32,935
What'd he say?

1817
01:47:33,030 --> 01:47:35,646
Oh, he says you remind him
of an uncle he has back in Tokyo.

1818
01:47:35,741 --> 01:47:37,902
I guess it's okay.

1819
01:47:37,993 --> 01:47:39,574
“What?

1820
01:47:39,662 --> 01:47:41,243
Oh, oh, he says you're very kind.

1821
01:47:41,330 --> 01:47:42,911
Ah, thank you.

1822
01:47:42,998 --> 01:47:44,158
Welcome.

1823
01:47:46,669 --> 01:47:48,250
All right, what are the rules here?

1824
01:47:48,337 --> 01:47:49,543
Don't know.

1825
01:47:49,838 --> 01:47:51,874
First time you, first time me.

1826
01:47:51,966 --> 01:47:54,002
Well, I figured you knew
about this stuff.

1827
01:47:54,093 --> 01:47:55,708
I figured you went to these before.

1828
01:47:55,803 --> 01:47:57,384
Oh, great. I'm dead. I am dead.

1829
01:47:57,471 --> 01:47:58,615
You told me you fought a lot.

1830
01:47:58,639 --> 01:48:01,255
Ah, for life, not for points.

1831
01:48:01,350 --> 01:48:03,466
Daniel, look, everything
above your waist is a point.

1832
01:48:03,560 --> 01:48:05,163
You can hit the head,
you can hit the sternum,

1833
01:48:05,187 --> 01:48:07,223
kidneys, and the ribs, got it?

1834
01:48:07,314 --> 01:48:08,429
I hope so.

1835
01:48:08,524 --> 01:48:09,559
Come on, you can do it.

1836
01:48:09,650 --> 01:48:11,766
Hey, when are you jerks gonna grow up?

1837
01:48:18,701 --> 01:48:20,441
Daniel: Where am I?
Over here at this one?

1838
01:48:20,536 --> 01:48:21,776
Miyagi: Number three.

1839
01:48:21,870 --> 01:48:23,348
What's that guy kneeling like that for?

1840
01:48:23,372 --> 01:48:24,372
Don't know.

1841
01:48:24,456 --> 01:48:26,287
Don't you know anything you can tell me?

1842
01:48:26,375 --> 01:48:27,375
Go, get the hit.

1843
01:48:35,384 --> 01:48:37,249
Bow. Face.

1844
01:48:37,845 --> 01:48:39,756
Bow. En garde.

1845
01:48:40,889 --> 01:48:42,049
Fight!

1846
01:48:48,355 --> 01:48:49,515
Referee: Back on your line.

1847
01:48:49,606 --> 01:48:50,886
Ali: Be tough, Daniel. Be tough.

1848
01:48:50,941 --> 01:48:52,727
No point. En garde.

1849
01:48:53,235 --> 01:48:54,350
Fight!

1850
01:48:54,445 --> 01:48:55,651
Ali: Come on. Be tough!

1851
01:48:58,198 --> 01:49:00,314
Daniel-San, remember your defense.

1852
01:49:00,409 --> 01:49:02,741
Points come. Concentrate. Focus power.

1853
01:49:02,828 --> 01:49:04,944
Remember balance. Make good fight.

1854
01:49:06,999 --> 01:49:08,535
Warning for running out of the ring.

1855
01:49:08,625 --> 01:49:10,081
Once more will cost you a point.

1856
01:49:10,169 --> 01:49:11,875
En garde. Ready?

1857
01:49:14,923 --> 01:49:15,923
Fight!

1858
01:49:20,637 --> 01:49:22,923
All right, Daniel, that's one. Come on!

1859
01:49:25,267 --> 01:49:26,552
One more.

1860
01:49:27,436 --> 01:49:29,051
Referee: Come back on your line.

1861
01:49:30,064 --> 01:49:32,225
That's one point, round kick.

1862
01:49:33,150 --> 01:49:35,857
All right, Daniel!
You're the best! You're the best!

1863
01:49:38,030 --> 01:49:40,146
Try to be best 'cause you're only a man

1864
01:49:40,240 --> 01:49:42,401
and a man's got to learn to take it

1865
01:49:42,493 --> 01:49:45,280
try to believe
though the goin' gets rough

1866
01:49:45,370 --> 01:49:47,702
that you got to hang tough to make it

1867
01:49:47,790 --> 01:49:50,782
history repeats itself

1868
01:49:50,876 --> 01:49:52,036
try and you'll succeed

1869
01:49:52,127 --> 01:49:53,788
you're history, man! You're dead!

1870
01:49:53,879 --> 01:49:55,415
Never doubt that you're the one

1871
01:49:55,506 --> 01:49:57,997
and you can have your dream

1872
01:49:58,092 --> 01:50:00,299
you're the best around

1873
01:50:00,385 --> 01:50:02,717
nothing's gonna ever keep you down

1874
01:50:02,805 --> 01:50:05,421
you're the best around

1875
01:50:05,516 --> 01:50:08,303
nothing's gonna ever keep you down

1876
01:50:08,393 --> 01:50:10,850

referee: Hall

1879
01:50:18,403 --> 01:50:20,314
fight to the end
'cause you'll have to depend

1880
01:50:20,656 --> 01:50:23,773
on the strength that you find inside you

1881
01:50:23,867 --> 01:50:25,232
point. Winner.

1882
01:50:28,413 --> 01:50:30,995
Try your best to win them all

1883
01:50:31,083 --> 01:50:33,074
in a world that's hard to tell

1884
01:50:33,168 --> 01:50:36,080
when you're the one
that's standing there

1885
01:50:36,171 --> 01:50:38,036
you've reached the final bell

1886
01:50:38,132 --> 01:50:40,919

point. Winner.

1901
01:51:39,193 --> 01:51:41,058
Fight till you drop

1902
01:51:41,570 --> 01:51:44,152
and never stop you can't give up

1903
01:51:44,239 --> 01:51:46,605
until you reach the top

1904
01:51:46,700 --> 01:51:48,531
you are the best in town

1905
01:51:49,786 --> 01:51:51,151
listen to that sound

1906
01:51:51,246 --> 01:51:54,238
a little bit of volume

1907
01:51:54,333 --> 01:51:56,494
can never bring you down

1908
01:51:56,585 --> 01:51:59,167

Oh, must be tight.

01:52:33,121 --> 01:52:34,327
Yeah, right there.

1922
01:52:35,082 --> 01:52:36,538
Never thought I'd get this far.

1923
01:52:36,625 --> 01:52:37,705
That make two of us.

1924
01:52:37,793 --> 01:52:39,374
Wouldn't it be great if I won?

1925
01:52:39,461 --> 01:52:41,201
Be great you survive.

1926
01:52:41,296 --> 01:52:42,752
Survive? What do you mean, survive?

1927
01:52:42,839 --> 01:52:43,942
Hey, you sure you're okay?
“What?

1928
01:52:43,966 --> 01:52:45,627
Yeah, I'm fine. As long as I don't move.

1929
01:52:45,717 --> 01:52:48,321
Yeah, we gotta move now, come on,
you've got to sign in. They're starting.

Bobby: Daniell

1972
01:55:36,221 --> 01:55:37,865
Daniel, I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
I didn't mean it!

1973
01:55:37,889 --> 01:55:39,845
My leg! No!

1974
01:55:39,975 --> 01:55:43,888
My leg hurts, Mr. miyagi! My leg hurts.

1975
01:55:43,979 --> 01:55:46,061
Miyagi here, Daniel-San. Okay.

1976
01:55:46,148 --> 01:55:47,809
Miyagi here, okay.

1977
01:55:47,899 --> 01:55:52,268

01:56:04,624 --> 01:56:08,742
John Lawrence automatically
will be awarded first place by default.

1983

I'll inform the judges.

1984
01:56:17,012 --> 01:56:19,378
You did well out there, young man.

1985
01:56:23,643 --> 01:56:24,643
Damn it!

1986
01:56:24,728 --> 01:56:29,097
Honey, forget it. Hey, you were great!

1987
01:56:29,983 --> 01:56:31,598
I couldn't be prouder.

1988
01:56:32,360 --> 01:56:34,100
It was just bad luck.

1989
01:56:34,196 --> 01:56:36,858
Daniel, you would have won
if they hadn't cheated.

1990
01:56:36,948 --> 01:56:39,439
Just leave me alone for a minute, okay?

1991
01:56:39,534 --> 01:56:41,024
We'll be outside.

1992
01:56:46,333 --> 01:56:47,823
Uh, Mr. miyagi...

1993
01:56:49,669 --> 01:56:50,669
Hmm.

1994
01:56:50,754 --> 01:56:52,961
You think I had a chance at winning?

1995
01:56:53,048 --> 01:56:54,538
Win, lose, no matter.

1996
01:56:54,633 --> 01:56:56,624
No, that's not what I mean.

1997
01:56:59,554 --> 01:57:00,554
Hey,

1998
01:57:01,306 --> 01:57:03,046
had good chance.

1999
01:57:04,100 --> 01:57:07,388
Well, can you fix my leg,
I mean, with that thing you do?

2000
01:57:07,479 --> 01:57:10,892
No need fight anymore. You prove point.

2001
01:57:10,982 --> 01:57:13,564
What point? That I can take a beating?

2002
01:57:13,652 --> 01:57:15,092
I mean, every time I see those guys,

2003
01:57:19,241 --> 01:57:23,575
I'll never have balance that way.
Not with them, not with Ali.

2004
01:57:27,207 --> 01:57:28,492
Not with me.

2005
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:32,955
Hmm.

2006
01:57:33,380 --> 01:57:34,460
What?

2007
01:57:37,300 --> 01:57:38,585
Close eye.

2008
01:57:58,572 --> 01:58:00,904

Daniel: Hey, Mr. miyagi.
We did it! We did it! All right!

2083
02:03:40,246 --> 02:03:43,033
When you're alone

2084
02:03:43,124 --> 02:03:46,742
you ask yourself

2085
02:03:47,962 --> 02:03:52,126
what are you searching for

2086
02:03:54,218 --> 02:03:57,210
deep in the night

2087
02:03:57,305 --> 02:04:00,843
a dream is born

2088
02:04:02,060 --> 02:04:06,804
one that you can't ignore

2089
02:04:07,649 --> 02:04:11,233
if you think you can find the passion

2090
02:04:11,319 --> 02:04:14,732
and you're ready to take a chance

2091
02:04:14,822 --> 02:04:18,155
if you really believe you can make it

2092
02:04:18,242 --> 02:04:21,484
then the power is in your own hands

2093
02:04:21,579 --> 02:04:23,695
it's the moment of truth

2094
02:04:23,790 --> 02:04:25,405
you're giving it all

2095
02:04:25,500 --> 02:04:28,958
standing alone, willing to fall

2096
02:04:29,045 --> 02:04:30,751
if you can do it

2097
02:04:30,838 --> 02:04:32,544
get up and prove it

2098
02:04:32,632 --> 02:04:35,590
get up and show them who you are

2099
02:04:35,677 --> 02:04:39,340
it's the moment of truth,
it's all on the line

2100
02:04:39,430 --> 02:04:42,843
this is the place, this is the time

2101
02:04:42,934 --> 02:04:46,472
you've waited forever,
it's now or it's never

2102
02:04:46,562 --> 02:04:49,804
nothing can stop you now

2103
02:04:53,444 --> 02:04:56,527
once in your life

2104
02:04:56,614 --> 02:05:00,072
you make a choice

2105
02:05:01,369 --> 02:05:05,282
ready to risk it all

2106
02:05:07,417 --> 02:05:10,284
deep in your soul

2107
02:05:10,378 --> 02:05:13,870
you hear the voice

2108
02:05:15,216 --> 02:05:20,085
answering to the call

2109
02:05:20,888 --> 02:05:24,380
though you know that it won't be easy

2110
02:05:24,475 --> 02:05:27,808
it's a promise you make for love

2111
02:05:27,895 --> 02:05:31,387
for the people that keep believing

2112
02:05:31,482 --> 02:05:34,815

02:05:38,740 --> 02:05:42,232
standing alone, willing to fall

2115
02:05:42,326 --> 02:05:45,693

2116
02:05:45,788 --> 02:05:48,780
get up and show them who you are

2117
02:05:48,875 --> 02:05:52,663

it's all on the line

2118
02:05:52,754 --> 02:05:55,962
this is the place, this is the time

02:05:59,761 --> 02:06:02,844
nothing can stop you now

2121
02:06:02,930 --> 02:06:06,468
it's the moment of truth,
you're giving it all

2122
02:06:06,559 --> 02:06:10,143
standing alone, willing to fall

2123
02:06:10,229 --> 02:06:13,596
if you can do it, get up and prove it

2124
02:06:13,691 --> 02:06:16,808
nothing can stop you now

2125
02:06:21,824 --> 02:06:25,442
It's the moment of truth,
you're giving it all

2126
02:06:25,828 --> 02:06:29,241
standing alone, willing to fall

2127
02:06:29,332 --> 02:06:32,745
