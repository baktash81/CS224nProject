Did you see what I saw?

00:04:00,369 --> 00:04:02,885
Come on, Joe. Open her up.
We're gonna have a big day today.

23
00:04:03,121 --> 00:04:04,077
Come on, get the door open.

24
00:04:11,338 --> 00:04:13,774
- You in a hurry?
- Yeah, I sure am.

25
00:04:14,091 --> 00:04:16,449
You're a fool. Come on.

26
00:04:21,307 --> 00:04:24,427
All right, all right, ladies and gentlemen,
let us begin.

27
00:04:25,686 --> 00:04:28,647
Now, will the bride and groom
kindly step forward?

28
00:04:31,734 --> 00:04:33,727
Will Kane and Amy Fowler,

29
00:04:33,945 --> 00:04:38,307
you appear before me in my capacity
as justice of the peace of this township

30
00:04:38,616 --> 00:04:42,135
to be joined together
in the bonds of holy matrimony.

31
00:04:49,085 --> 00:04:53,001
- Man, it sure is hot.
- Hot? You call this hot?

32
00:04:57,052 --> 00:04:58,247
Well, I'll be...

33
00:04:58,427 --> 00:05:00,659
- What's the matter?
- Thought I saw Ben Miller.

34
00:05:00,972 --> 00:05:03,808
- He's down in Texas somewhere.
- I know.

35
00:05:04,142 --> 00:05:06,180
Looked like Pierce and Colby, too.

36
00:05:06,771 --> 00:05:08,126
It couldn't be, though.

37
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:30,186
My goodness gracious.

38
00:05:36,842 --> 00:05:39,882
- Noon train on time?
- Yes, sir.

39
00:05:40,222 --> 00:05:42,021
At least, I think so, sir.

40
00:05:42,223 --> 00:05:45,776
Don't know a reason
why it shouldn't be, Mr Pierce.

41
00:05:46,769 --> 00:05:51,449
How are you, Mr Miller?
Mr Pierce? Mr Colby?

42
00:06:27,061 --> 00:06:30,136
Do you, Will Kane,
take Amy to be your lawful wedded wife,

43
00:06:30,397 --> 00:06:32,435
to have and to hold
from this day forward

44
00:06:32,651 --> 00:06:34,244
until death do you part?

45
00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:36,173
I do.

46
00:06:36,445 --> 00:06:39,201
Do you, Amy, take Will
to be your lawful wedded husband,

47
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:42,095
to have and to hold
from this day forward

48
00:06:42,327 --> 00:06:44,001
until death do you part?

49
00:06:44,286 --> 00:06:45,356
I do.

50
00:06:45,956 --> 00:06:48,153
The ring, please.

51
00:06:54,339 --> 00:06:58,018
Then, by the authority vested in me
by the laws of this territory,

52
00:06:58,385 --> 00:07:00,855
I pronounce you man and wife.

53
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:11,270
I can't speak for the rest of you men,
but I claim an ancient privilege.

54
00:07:19,073 --> 00:07:21,145
Moving mighty fast for a Sunday.

55
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:26,286
Will!

56
00:07:27,832 --> 00:07:29,711
All those people.

57
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:34,141
Amy, seems to me like people ought to
be alone when they get married.

58
00:07:34,505 --> 00:07:35,700
I know.

59
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:40,231
I'm going to try, Amy. I'll do my best.

60
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,040
I will, too.

61
00:07:49,604 --> 00:07:52,405
The honeymoon is officially over.
Come on, everybody.

62
00:07:52,732 --> 00:07:54,053
And don't look so shocked.

63
00:07:54,234 --> 00:07:56,704
No way to treat a man
on his honeymoon day, is it?

64
00:07:57,237 --> 00:08:00,437
Well, one more ceremony
and Will's a free man,

65
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:02,498
more or less.

66
00:08:02,702 --> 00:08:04,660
Well, Marshal, turn in your badge.

67
00:08:04,995 --> 00:08:06,554
To tell you the truth,
I kind of hate to do this

68
00:08:06,747 --> 00:08:08,501
without your new marshal being here.

69
00:08:08,706 --> 00:08:12,943
Will, Fuller, Howe and I are the entire
Board of Selectmen of this community.

70
00:08:13,254 --> 00:08:15,372
We're also your very good friends.

71
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:18,152
With the fine job you've done here,
I feel free to say,

72
00:08:18,383 --> 00:08:19,943
and the judge will bear me out,

73
00:08:20,135 --> 00:08:22,128
this town will be safe till tomorrow.

74
00:08:23,764 --> 00:08:24,994
You win.

75
00:08:25,807 --> 00:08:28,370
But don't ever marry a Quaker.
She'll have you running a store.

76
00:08:28,603 --> 00:08:31,359
- I can't picture you doing that, Will.
- I can.

77
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:34,486
So can I. And a good thing, too.

78
00:08:34,859 --> 00:08:35,929
Thank you.

79
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,655
You didn't talk that way
when you were wearing a star.

80
00:08:41,366 --> 00:08:44,645
All right, it's coming off.
But I got to be paid first.

81
00:08:46,996 --> 00:08:48,589
Let me down!

82
00:08:49,457 --> 00:08:52,418
- Not till you kiss me.
- Let me down, you fool.

83
00:09:06,809 --> 00:09:09,325
Nice delaying action, Will.
You should've been a lawyer.

84
00:09:09,561 --> 00:09:11,474
- I was cut out for bigger sport.
- Marshal.

85
00:09:11,688 --> 00:09:13,361
Marshal, telegram for you.

86
00:09:15,818 --> 00:09:17,890
It's terrible. It's shocking.

87
00:09:20,238 --> 00:09:21,673
They've pardoned Frank Miller.

88
00:09:21,865 --> 00:09:23,698
- What is it, Will?
- I don't believe it.

89
00:09:24,326 --> 00:09:27,766
A week ago, too.
Nice of them to let you know.

90
00:09:28,122 --> 00:09:29,351
And that ain't all.

91
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:32,375
Ben Miller's down at the depot now
with Jim Pierce and Jack Colby.

92
00:09:32,711 --> 00:09:35,352
- He asked about the noon train.
- The noon train?

93
00:09:39,008 --> 00:09:42,048
Will, you get out of this town.

94
00:09:42,888 --> 00:09:44,721
Get out of this town this very minute.

95
00:09:44,931 --> 00:09:46,126
- Come on, let's get him going.
- What is it?

96
00:09:46,306 --> 00:09:47,296
Never mind that now.

97
00:09:47,475 --> 00:09:49,786
Just get going
and don't stop till you get to Clarksburg.

98
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:51,009
But what is it, Mr Howe?

99
00:09:51,187 --> 00:09:52,223
Don't you worry, madam.

100
00:09:52,398 --> 00:09:54,675
You'll be out of town
in a minute and everything'll be all right.

101
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:56,253
Go on, Will,
we'll take care of everything.

102
00:09:56,443 --> 00:09:57,763
I think I ought to stay.

103
00:09:57,944 --> 00:09:59,777
Are you crazy? Think of Amy.

104
00:10:04,075 --> 00:10:05,191
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Amy.

105
00:10:05,369 --> 00:10:07,965
Don't you worry.
Everything will be all right.

106
00:10:08,204 --> 00:10:10,037
- Well done, boy.
- Hurry.

107
00:10:29,018 --> 00:10:30,533
That's funny.

108
00:10:32,897 --> 00:10:34,252
What?

109
00:10:34,524 --> 00:10:36,198
Well, you can't see now.

110
00:10:36,608 --> 00:10:39,284
Kane and his new wife
just took off in a big hurry.

111
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,921
- What's so funny?
- I mean a big hurry.

112
00:10:44,701 --> 00:10:48,254
Hey, you don't suppose Kane's scared
of those three gunnies?

113
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:54,603
Well, you didn't see him.
I never saw him whip a horse that way.

114
00:11:07,057 --> 00:11:09,129
- Sam!
- Come in, Helen.

115
00:11:09,434 --> 00:11:13,272
Ben Miller is in town.
He has two of the old bunch with him.

116
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:20,198
I guess I'll take a look around.

117
00:12:05,366 --> 00:12:08,520
- Why are you stopping?
- It's no good. I've got to go back, Amy.

118
00:12:08,871 --> 00:12:10,225
Why?

119
00:12:10,413 --> 00:12:12,053
This is crazy.
I haven't even got any guns.

120
00:12:12,249 --> 00:12:14,207
Then let's go on. Hurry.

121
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:17,462
No, that's what I've been thinking.

122
00:12:18,088 --> 00:12:21,128
They're making me run.
I've never run from anybody before.

123
00:12:21,382 --> 00:12:25,015
- Well, I don't understand any of this.
- Well, I haven't got time to tell you.

124
00:12:25,305 --> 00:12:29,063
- Then don't go back, Will.
- I've got to. That's the whole thing.

125
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,010
- Kane's back.
- I don't believe it.

126
00:13:34,249 --> 00:13:35,603
I just seen him.

127
00:13:39,256 --> 00:13:41,135
- How many coffins we got?
- Two.

128
00:13:41,341 --> 00:13:43,698
We're going to need at least two more
no matter how you figure.

129
00:13:43,926 --> 00:13:45,646
You'd better get busy, Fred.

130
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:52,511
Please, Will, if you'd just tell me
what this is all about.

131
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,797
I sent a man up five years ago
for murder.

132
00:13:56,022 --> 00:13:57,615
He was supposed to hang.

133
00:13:57,816 --> 00:14:01,529
But up north, they commuted it to life.
Now he's free.

134
00:14:02,154 --> 00:14:04,829
I don't know how.
Anyway, it looks like he's coming back.

135
00:14:05,074 --> 00:14:06,633
- I still don't understand.
- He's a...

136
00:14:07,409 --> 00:14:11,247
Well, he was always wild, kind of crazy.
He'll probably make trouble.

137
00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:15,056
But that's no concern of yours,
not anymore.

138
00:14:15,918 --> 00:14:17,990
I'm the one who sent him up.

139
00:14:18,295 --> 00:14:19,810
Well, that was part of your job.

140
00:14:20,005 --> 00:14:22,920
That's finished now.
They've got a new marshal.

141
00:14:23,177 --> 00:14:27,220
He won't be here till tomorrow.
Seems to me I've got to stay.

142
00:14:28,347 --> 00:14:30,704
Anyway, I'm the same man,
with or without this.

143
00:14:30,933 --> 00:14:32,367
Well, that isn't so.

144
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:34,199
I expect he'll come looking for me.

145
00:14:34,394 --> 00:14:36,352
Three of his old bunch are waiting
at the depot.

146
00:14:36,563 --> 00:14:38,442
That's exactly why we ought to go.

147
00:14:38,648 --> 00:14:41,211
They'll just come after us. Four of them.

148
00:14:41,986 --> 00:14:43,944
And we'd be all alone on the prairie.

149
00:14:44,906 --> 00:14:45,942
We've got an hour.

150
00:14:46,116 --> 00:14:47,550
- What's an hour?
- Well, we could...

151
00:14:47,744 --> 00:14:50,579
What's 100 miles? We'd never be able
to keep that store, Amy.

152
00:14:50,829 --> 00:14:53,391
They'd come after us and we'd have to
run again as long as we live.

153
00:14:53,623 --> 00:14:56,857
No, we wouldn't.
Not if they didn't know where to find us.

154
00:14:58,796 --> 00:15:01,950
Oh, Will.
Will, I'm begging you, please let's go.

155
00:15:02,215 --> 00:15:03,205
I can't.

156
00:15:03,382 --> 00:15:06,502
Don't try to be a hero.
You don't have to be a hero. Not for me.

157
00:15:06,762 --> 00:15:10,884
I'm not trying to be a hero.
If you think I like this, you're crazy.

158
00:15:11,267 --> 00:15:13,989
Look, Amy, this is my town.
I've got friends here.

159
00:15:14,435 --> 00:15:15,995
I'll swear in a bunch of special deputies

160
00:15:16,188 --> 00:15:18,659
and with a posse behind me,
maybe there won't even be any trouble.

161
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:23,101
- You know there'll be trouble.
- Then it's better to have it here.

162
00:15:28,408 --> 00:15:30,844
I'm sorry, honey.
I know how you feel about it.

163
00:15:31,078 --> 00:15:32,479
Do you?

164
00:15:32,663 --> 00:15:35,419
Of course I do.
I know it's against your religion and all.

165
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:39,429
- Sure I know how you feel.
- But you're doing it just the same.

166
00:15:40,754 --> 00:15:44,797
Oh, Will, we were married
just a few minutes ago.

167
00:15:45,634 --> 00:15:49,152
We've got our whole lives ahead of us.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

168
00:15:50,056 --> 00:15:52,971
You know I've only got an hour
and I've got lots to do.

169
00:15:53,851 --> 00:15:55,923
Stay at the hotel until it's over.

170
00:15:56,145 --> 00:15:58,582
No, I won't be here when it' s over.

171
00:15:58,816 --> 00:16:00,376
You're asking me to wait an hour

172
00:16:00,567 --> 00:16:02,446
to find out if I'm going to be
a wife or a widow.

173
00:16:02,653 --> 00:16:04,964
I say it's too long to wait. I won't do it.

174
00:16:05,196 --> 00:16:06,151
Amy!

175
00:16:06,322 --> 00:16:10,319
I mean it, if you won't go with me now,
I'll be on that train when it leaves here.

176
00:16:11,954 --> 00:16:13,753
I've got to stay.

177
00:16:37,147 --> 00:16:39,060
- Glad you got here, Perce.
- Are you?

178
00:16:51,995 --> 00:16:55,354
Have you forgotten that I'm the man
who passed sentence on Frank Miller?

179
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,637
You shouldn't have come back, Will.
It was stupid.

180
00:16:59,878 --> 00:17:03,272
I figured I had to. I figured I had to stay.

181
00:17:03,674 --> 00:17:05,029
You figured wrong.

182
00:17:05,217 --> 00:17:07,859
I can deputise a posse.
Ten, 12 guns is all I need.

183
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:10,326
Yeah, my intuition tells me otherwise.

184
00:17:11,014 --> 00:17:11,970
Why?

185
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:16,568
No time for a lesson in civics, my boy.

186
00:17:17,229 --> 00:17:19,540
In the fifth century B.C.,
the citizens of Athens,

187
00:17:19,774 --> 00:17:21,686
having suffered grievously
under a tyrant,

188
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,380
managed to depose and banish him.

189
00:17:23,568 --> 00:17:25,686
However, when he returned
some years later

190
00:17:25,905 --> 00:17:26,975
with an army of mercenaries,

191
00:17:27,156 --> 00:17:30,515
those same citizens
not only opened the gates for him,

192
00:17:30,993 --> 00:17:34,466
but stood by while he executed
members of the legal government.

193
00:17:35,832 --> 00:17:38,428
A similar thing happened
about eight years ago

194
00:17:38,669 --> 00:17:41,060
in a town called Indian Falls.

195
00:17:41,838 --> 00:17:45,117
I escaped death
only through the intercession of a lady

196
00:17:45,382 --> 00:17:47,740
of somewhat dubious reputation,

197
00:17:47,969 --> 00:17:51,886
and at the cost of a very handsome ring
which once belonged to my mother.

198
00:17:52,181 --> 00:17:55,621
- Unfortunately, I have no more rings.
- You're a judge.

199
00:17:55,977 --> 00:17:58,892
I've been a judge many times
in many towns.

200
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,758
And I hope to live to be a judge again.

201
00:18:03,234 --> 00:18:04,669
I can't tell you what to do.

202
00:18:04,861 --> 00:18:07,697
Why must you be so stupid, Will?
Have you forgotten what he is?

203
00:18:07,947 --> 00:18:09,267
Have you forgotten
what he's done to people?

204
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:11,090
Have you forgotten that he's crazy?

205
00:18:11,284 --> 00:18:13,277
Don't you remember
when he sat in that chair and said,

206
00:18:13,495 --> 00:18:14,215
"You'll never hang me. I'll come back.

207
00:18:14,245 --> 00:18:15,965
"You'll never hang me. I'll come back.

208
00:18:16,164 --> 00:18:19,000
"I'll kill you, Will Kane.
I swear it, I'll kill you"?

209
00:18:26,509 --> 00:18:28,741
Here you are, ma'am.
This'll take you to Saint Louis.

210
00:18:28,969 --> 00:18:30,085
Thank you.

211
00:18:37,477 --> 00:18:39,196
Maybe you'd rather wait
somewheres else.

212
00:18:39,397 --> 00:18:40,911
Like at the hotel, maybe.

213
00:18:41,106 --> 00:18:42,302
All right, thank you.

214
00:18:42,483 --> 00:18:44,601
I'm awfully sorry
about all this, Mrs Kane.

215
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,974
But don't you worry, the marshal
will take care of himself all right.

216
00:18:48,239 --> 00:18:49,754
Thank you very much.

217
00:18:51,617 --> 00:18:53,575
Hey, that wasn't here five years ago.

218
00:18:54,161 --> 00:18:55,596
So what?

219
00:18:55,788 --> 00:18:58,510
Nothing. Yet.

220
00:19:03,714 --> 00:19:07,347
Harvey, don't you think Kane
will be looking for you about now?

221
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:08,715
Yeah.

222
00:19:09,844 --> 00:19:11,279
You're really sore at him.

223
00:19:11,764 --> 00:19:13,084
Wouldn't you be if you were me?

224
00:19:13,266 --> 00:19:15,179
I suppose. If I were you.

225
00:19:24,276 --> 00:19:25,869
Be back in a little while.

226
00:19:47,883 --> 00:19:49,603
- Bye, Will.
- Goodbye.

227
00:19:50,971 --> 00:19:53,726
- Think I'm letting you down, don't you?
- No.

228
00:19:54,264 --> 00:19:57,145
Look, this is just a dirty little village
in the middle of nowhere.

229
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:00,691
Nothing that happens here
is really important. Now get out.

230
00:20:01,314 --> 00:20:02,828
There isn't time.

231
00:20:03,984 --> 00:20:06,580
What a waste. Good luck.

232
00:20:18,831 --> 00:20:20,060
Johnny.

233
00:20:23,253 --> 00:20:25,975
- Why aren't you in church?
- Why ain't you?

234
00:20:26,924 --> 00:20:28,358
- Look, will you do something for me?
- Sure.

235
00:20:28,551 --> 00:20:30,430
Go find Joe Henderson,
Mart Howe and Sam Fuller

236
00:20:30,634 --> 00:20:32,274
- and tell them I want them here.
- Right.

237
00:20:32,471 --> 00:20:35,672
- And then find Harv Pell.
- Don't have to do that, here I am.

238
00:20:36,225 --> 00:20:38,104
- Well, where have you been?
- Busy.

239
00:20:39,479 --> 00:20:40,800
- You know what's doing?
- Sure.

240
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,050
Well, come on, we got lots to do.

241
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:45,829
Hold up a second.
This ain't really your job, you know.

242
00:20:46,193 --> 00:20:47,547
Well, that's what everybody
keeps telling me.

243
00:20:47,738 --> 00:20:50,459
When I tell you, it means something,
so you can just listen a second.

244
00:20:50,698 --> 00:20:52,132
All right, I'm listening.

245
00:20:52,743 --> 00:20:54,143
Now, this is the way I see it.

246
00:20:54,618 --> 00:20:57,054
If you'd gone, with the new marshal
not due here till tomorrow,

247
00:20:57,288 --> 00:20:58,962
I'd be in charge around here, right?

248
00:20:59,165 --> 00:21:00,281
Right.

249
00:21:00,457 --> 00:21:01,972
Well, tell me this, then,

250
00:21:02,168 --> 00:21:04,445
if I'm good enough to hold down the job
when there's trouble,

251
00:21:04,671 --> 00:21:06,903
how come the city fathers
didn't trust me with it permanent?

252
00:21:07,131 --> 00:21:08,805
I don't know.

253
00:21:09,008 --> 00:21:11,126
- Don't you?
- No.

254
00:21:11,345 --> 00:21:13,303
That's funny, I figured
you carried a lot of weight.

255
00:21:14,055 --> 00:21:17,608
Maybe they didn't ask me.
Maybe they figured you were too young.

256
00:21:17,894 --> 00:21:19,409
You think I'm too young, too?

257
00:21:19,603 --> 00:21:21,675
You sure act like it sometimes.
Come on.

258
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:32,497
It's very simple, Will.

259
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,293
All you gotta do is tell the old boys
when they come

260
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:35,813
that I'm the new marshal.

261
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:38,295
And tomorrow
they can tell the other fellow

262
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:40,455
they're sorry, but the job's filled.

263
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,228
- You really mean it, don't you?
- Sure.

264
00:21:45,546 --> 00:21:48,221
- Well, I can't do it.
- Why not?

265
00:21:48,883 --> 00:21:51,115
If you don't know,
it's no use me telling you.

266
00:21:51,344 --> 00:21:52,460
You mean you won't do it.

267
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,371
Have it your way.

268
00:21:54,556 --> 00:21:57,869
All right, the truth is you probably
talked against me from the start.

269
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:03,006
You've been sore about me and
Helen Ramírez right along, ain't you?

270
00:22:04,441 --> 00:22:06,000
You and Helen Ramírez?

271
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:09,164
It so happens I didn't know,

272
00:22:09,364 --> 00:22:11,322
and it doesn't mean anything to me
one way or the other.

273
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:12,567
You ought to know that.

274
00:22:12,741 --> 00:22:14,734
Yeah, you been washed up
for more than a year.

275
00:22:14,951 --> 00:22:16,750
Oh, you go out and get yourself married,

276
00:22:16,953 --> 00:22:19,629
only you can't stand anybody
taking your place there, can you?

277
00:22:19,874 --> 00:22:22,107
- Especially me.
- You're a...

278
00:22:28,424 --> 00:22:30,462
I haven't got time, Harv.

279
00:22:30,676 --> 00:22:33,147
Okay, then let's get down to business.

280
00:22:33,763 --> 00:22:35,996
You want me to stick,
you put the word in for me like I said.

281
00:22:36,223 --> 00:22:37,737
Sure, I want you to stick.

282
00:22:37,933 --> 00:22:40,575
But I'm not buying it.
It's got to be up to you.

283
00:23:15,847 --> 00:23:17,600
I thought you'd grew up by now.

284
00:23:18,641 --> 00:23:22,399
I thought your disposition might have
sweetened up a little down in Abilene.

285
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,460
I guess we're both wrong.

286
00:23:32,447 --> 00:23:33,848
What's so funny?

287
00:23:34,868 --> 00:23:37,259
Did you really think
you could put that over on Kane?

288
00:23:37,494 --> 00:23:38,450
Why not?

289
00:23:38,829 --> 00:23:40,502
When are you going to grow up?

290
00:23:40,956 --> 00:23:42,356
I'm getting tired of that kind of talk.

291
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:44,739
- Then grow up.
- Cut it out!

292
00:23:50,258 --> 00:23:51,328
All right.

293
00:23:51,884 --> 00:23:53,956
Why shouldn't he have gone for it?
He needs me.

294
00:23:54,178 --> 00:23:55,932
He'll need me plenty
when Frank Miller gets here.

295
00:23:56,139 --> 00:23:57,129
That's possible.

296
00:23:57,307 --> 00:23:58,788
Should've had me made marshal
to begin with.

297
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:01,333
He's just sore, is all.
Sore about you and me.

298
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,454
- Is he?
- Sure.

299
00:24:04,271 --> 00:24:06,389
- You told him?
- Sure.

300
00:24:07,443 --> 00:24:08,593
You are a fool.

301
00:24:10,737 --> 00:24:13,299
Why? Didn't you want him to know?

302
00:24:15,325 --> 00:24:19,004
Hey, who did the walking out, anyway?
You or him?

303
00:24:24,209 --> 00:24:25,325
Get out, Harvey.

304
00:24:26,879 --> 00:24:29,111
- I might just do that.
- Then do it.

305
00:24:31,717 --> 00:24:34,028
- You don't mean that.
- Try me.

306
00:24:35,638 --> 00:24:38,029
You're gonna talk different
when Frank Miller gets here.

307
00:24:38,265 --> 00:24:39,540
You might want somebody
around you then

308
00:24:39,725 --> 00:24:41,445
when you try to explain to him
about Kane.

309
00:24:41,644 --> 00:24:43,602
- I can take care of myself.
- Sure.

310
00:24:44,272 --> 00:24:45,228
Only from what I've heard,

311
00:24:45,398 --> 00:24:47,516
you might not be so pretty
when he gets through with you.

312
00:24:52,154 --> 00:24:54,352
- I won't be back.
- Good.

313
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:07,779
Come in.

314
00:25:09,715 --> 00:25:12,026
I just saw Harvey. Is everything all right?

315
00:25:12,633 --> 00:25:15,024
I think I have to talk with Mr Weaver.

316
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:19,163
- You're getting out?
- Yes.

317
00:25:19,808 --> 00:25:21,528
You want me to give Kane a hand?

318
00:25:28,108 --> 00:25:30,783
- No.
- All right.

319
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,369
May I wait here for the noon train?

320
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:49,255
I said, may I wait in the lobby
until noon?

321
00:25:51,048 --> 00:25:52,402
Sure, lady.

322
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,201
Thank you.

323
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:59,200
- You're Mrs Kane, ain't you?
- Yes.

324
00:25:59,473 --> 00:26:01,785
- You're leaving on the noon train?
- Yes.

325
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:03,372
But your husband ain't?

326
00:26:04,103 --> 00:26:05,173
No. Why?

327
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:07,348
No reason, but it's mighty interesting.

328
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:12,469
Now, me, I wouldn't leave this town
at noon for all the tea in China.

329
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:16,013
No, sir.
It's going to be quite a sight to see.

330
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:18,884
- Will, I just heard about...
- Hello, Herb.

331
00:27:19,139 --> 00:27:21,417
You can count on me.
You know that, don't you?

332
00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:23,619
I was figuring I could.

333
00:27:23,811 --> 00:27:25,006
The way you cleaned this town up,

334
00:27:25,186 --> 00:27:27,065
you made it fit
for women and kids to live in.

335
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:29,469
Miller nor nobody else
will ever drag it down again.

336
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:31,649
I was hoping people would feel that way.

337
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,616
What other way is there?
How many men you got lined up?

338
00:27:36,699 --> 00:27:37,894
None, yet.

339
00:27:40,077 --> 00:27:41,876
Well, you better get going, man.

340
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:45,200
I'll be back in 10 minutes,
loaded and prepared.

341
00:28:16,948 --> 00:28:18,178
Where is he?

342
00:28:19,743 --> 00:28:23,057
He's coming up the back way.
There's a careful man.

343
00:28:28,127 --> 00:28:29,163
Come in, Mr Weaver.

344
00:28:29,336 --> 00:28:30,326
- Hello, Mrs Ramírez.
- Hello.

345
00:28:30,504 --> 00:28:32,098
- Sit down, please.
- Thanks.

346
00:28:34,926 --> 00:28:37,601
- Is there anything wrong, Mrs Ramírez?
- No.

347
00:28:37,845 --> 00:28:39,121
Then why did you send for me?

348
00:28:39,306 --> 00:28:41,742
I'm leaving town. I want to sell the store.

349
00:28:41,974 --> 00:28:44,889
- You want to buy me out?
- Well, how much did you want?

350
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:47,432
$2,000. I think that's fair.

351
00:28:48,564 --> 00:28:51,878
Well, it's fair, all right,
but I couldn't raise that much right now.

352
00:28:52,153 --> 00:28:55,626
- How much can you raise?
- Oh, $1,000.

353
00:28:57,824 --> 00:29:01,376
All right.
You can pay Sam the rest in six months

354
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,813
and he'll get it to me. A deal?

355
00:29:04,455 --> 00:29:05,776
Yes, ma'am.

356
00:29:06,166 --> 00:29:09,241
All right, Mr Weaver. Thank you.

357
00:29:11,462 --> 00:29:14,502
Mrs Ramírez,
I want to thank you for everything.

358
00:29:14,758 --> 00:29:18,356
I mean, when you first called me in
and put the deal to me about

359
00:29:18,887 --> 00:29:21,643
staking me in the store
and being a silent partner.

360
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:23,290
You know, my wife thought...

361
00:29:26,604 --> 00:29:28,962
What I really mean to say is that

362
00:29:29,607 --> 00:29:31,679
you've been real decent to me
right along.

363
00:29:32,151 --> 00:29:34,109
And I want you to know
that I've been honest with you.

364
00:29:34,443 --> 00:29:36,676
I know you have, Mr Weaver. Goodbye.

365
00:29:37,155 --> 00:29:40,355
Goodbye, Mrs Ramírez,
and good luck to you.

366
00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:41,575
Thank you.

367
00:29:55,676 --> 00:29:57,235
- Oh, Will.
- Amy.

368
00:29:57,425 --> 00:29:59,145
You've changed your mind.

369
00:30:01,096 --> 00:30:03,328
I thought you had changed yours.

370
00:30:06,562 --> 00:30:08,555
No, Will, I have my ticket.

371
00:30:12,315 --> 00:30:13,670
I see.

372
00:30:15,195 --> 00:30:18,190
Open 19 and clean it up good.
Mr Miller's very particular.

373
00:30:19,074 --> 00:30:21,192
- Is Helen Ramírez in?
- I guess so.

374
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:25,089
Think you can find it all right?

375
00:30:35,214 --> 00:30:36,364
Come in.

376
00:30:48,728 --> 00:30:52,007
What are you looking at?
You think I have changed?

377
00:30:56,112 --> 00:30:58,105
Well, what do you want?

378
00:30:58,322 --> 00:31:01,203
You want me to help you?
You want me to ask Frank to let you go?

379
00:31:01,451 --> 00:31:03,091
You want me to beg for you?

380
00:31:03,286 --> 00:31:06,281
Well, I would not do it.
I would not lift a finger for you.

381
00:31:07,957 --> 00:31:09,074
I came to tell you he was coming.

382
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:11,083
I should have figured
you'd know about it.

383
00:31:11,712 --> 00:31:13,352
I know about it.

384
00:31:13,545 --> 00:31:16,346
I think you ought to get out of town.
I might not be able to... Well,

385
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,636
- anything can happen.
- I am not afraid of him.

386
00:31:21,555 --> 00:31:25,188
I know you're not,
but you know how he is.

387
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,824
I know how he is.

388
00:31:31,273 --> 00:31:33,266
Maybe he doesn't know.

389
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:37,081
- He's probably got letters.
- Probably.

390
00:31:39,991 --> 00:31:41,391
Nothing in life is free.

391
00:31:42,535 --> 00:31:47,170
- I'm getting out. I'm packing now.
- That's good.

392
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:04,945
Goodbye, Helen.

393
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:10,014
Kane, if you're smart,
you will get out, too.

394
00:32:12,023 --> 00:32:14,141
- I can't.
- I know.

395
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:48,044
- May I ask you something?
- Sure.

396
00:32:48,686 --> 00:32:51,761
- Who is Miss Ramírez?
- Mrs Ramírez?

397
00:32:53,191 --> 00:32:56,231
She used to be a friend
of your husband's a while back.

398
00:32:56,486 --> 00:32:58,604
Before that,
she was a friend of Frank Miller's.

399
00:32:59,947 --> 00:33:02,099
I see. Thank you.

400
00:33:05,287 --> 00:33:08,168
- You don't like my husband, do you?
- No.

401
00:33:08,414 --> 00:33:11,010
- Why?
- Lots of reasons.

402
00:33:11,251 --> 00:33:14,327
One thing, this place was always busy
when Frank Miller was around.

403
00:33:15,005 --> 00:33:16,326
I'm not the only one.

404
00:33:16,506 --> 00:33:20,184
There's plenty people around here
think he's got a comeuppance coming.

405
00:33:20,469 --> 00:33:23,065
You asked me, ma'am,
so I'm telling you.

406
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,459
You know, I think I'll go get some liquor.

407
00:33:47,662 --> 00:33:50,418
- Do you have to have it?
- Yeah.

408
00:33:50,666 --> 00:33:53,900
- If you're going after that woman...
- I said I was going for liquor.

409
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:57,131
- You keep away from Kane.
- Sure, I can wait.

410
00:34:12,189 --> 00:34:13,145
Hiya, Harvey.

411
00:34:25,577 --> 00:34:27,490
- Hello, Harv.
- How are you?

412
00:34:27,703 --> 00:34:31,586
- Where's the tin star?
- I turned it in. I quit.

413
00:34:31,877 --> 00:34:33,436
Smart move.

414
00:34:34,835 --> 00:34:36,748
I didn't ask you for your opinion.

415
00:35:04,201 --> 00:35:06,957
Hey, Ben! Hey, how are you, Ben?

416
00:35:09,288 --> 00:35:10,483
Look who's here.

417
00:35:12,208 --> 00:35:14,565
- How are you, Ben?
- All right, give me a bottle.

418
00:35:15,169 --> 00:35:16,604
Sure thing.

419
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:22,324
- It's been a long time, Ben.
- Yeah.

420
00:35:22,594 --> 00:35:24,551
Yes, sir. How's Frank?

421
00:35:26,222 --> 00:35:27,782
He's not complaining.

422
00:35:27,974 --> 00:35:31,687
Well, there'll be a hot time
in the old town tonight, eh, Ben?

423
00:35:34,815 --> 00:35:35,931
I wouldn't be surprised.

424
00:36:29,161 --> 00:36:32,999
I'll give you odds. Kane's dead five
minutes after Frank gets off the train.

425
00:36:33,292 --> 00:36:36,890
- That's not much time.
- That's all Frank'll need because I...

426
00:36:51,185 --> 00:36:53,701
You carry a badge and a gun, Marshal.

427
00:36:54,563 --> 00:36:55,838
You had no call to do that.

428
00:36:58,192 --> 00:36:59,387
You're right.

429
00:37:02,406 --> 00:37:04,160
No.

430
00:37:13,792 --> 00:37:15,671
I guess you all know why I'm here.

431
00:37:15,877 --> 00:37:19,112
I need deputies. I'll take all I can get.

432
00:37:23,426 --> 00:37:26,148
You must be crazy coming in here
to raise a posse.

433
00:37:26,388 --> 00:37:29,349
Frank's got friends in this room.
You ought to know that.

434
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,436
Some of you were special deputies
when we broke this bunch.

435
00:37:34,688 --> 00:37:36,841
I need you again. Now.

436
00:37:39,026 --> 00:37:40,585
Things were different then, Kane.

437
00:37:40,779 --> 00:37:43,375
You had six steady deputies
to start off with.

438
00:37:43,613 --> 00:37:47,405
Every one a top gun.
You ain't got but two now.

439
00:37:47,869 --> 00:37:51,786
You ain't got two.
Harv Pell here says he just quit. Why?

440
00:37:55,209 --> 00:37:56,883
That's between the two of us.

441
00:37:57,085 --> 00:37:58,314
You're asking an awful lot, Kane,

442
00:37:58,503 --> 00:38:00,701
considering the kind of man
Frank Miller is.

443
00:38:00,924 --> 00:38:04,203
All right, we all know what Miller's like.

444
00:38:04,468 --> 00:38:07,031
That's why I'm here. How about it?

445
00:39:16,418 --> 00:39:19,652
Mildred. Mildred, he's coming.
Now, you do like I told you.

446
00:39:19,921 --> 00:39:22,961
I'm not home. Don't let him in.
No matter what he says, I'm not home.

447
00:39:23,217 --> 00:39:24,367
Sam, he's your friend.

448
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:26,622
Don't argue with me.
He'll be here in a second.

449
00:39:26,845 --> 00:39:28,724
He won't believe me.
He'll know I'm lying.

450
00:39:28,929 --> 00:39:30,284
You do like I tell you.

451
00:39:47,491 --> 00:39:51,454
- Hello, Mrs Fuller, is Sam in?
- No. No, he isn't.

452
00:39:54,331 --> 00:39:57,485
Do you know where he is, Mrs Fuller?
It's important to me that I find him.

453
00:39:57,752 --> 00:40:02,035
I think... He's in church, Will.
He's gone to church.

454
00:40:04,508 --> 00:40:05,624
Without you?

455
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,033
I'm gonna go in a little while,
as soon as I dress.

456
00:40:14,312 --> 00:40:16,954
Thank you, Mrs Fuller. Goodbye.

457
00:40:41,046 --> 00:40:44,280
Now, what do you want?
Do you want me to get killed?

458
00:40:44,549 --> 00:40:46,747
Do you want to be a widow?
Is that what you want?

459
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:48,724
No, Sam, no.

460
00:40:49,931 --> 00:40:50,887
Kane.

461
00:40:53,766 --> 00:40:57,523
- What's the matter, Jimmy?
- Nothing. I've been looking for you.

462
00:40:57,813 --> 00:41:01,286
I want a gun. I want to be with you
when that train comes in.

463
00:41:02,902 --> 00:41:06,899
- Can you handle a gun?
- Sure I can. I used to be good.

464
00:41:07,322 --> 00:41:08,757
- Honest.
- But why...

465
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:11,466
It ain't just getting even.
It's a chance, see? It's what I need.

466
00:41:11,703 --> 00:41:13,935
Please, Kane, let me get in on this.

467
00:41:15,248 --> 00:41:18,049
All right, Jimmy,
I'll call you if I need you.

468
00:41:18,793 --> 00:41:20,751
Get yourself a drink meanwhile, huh?

469
00:41:31,848 --> 00:41:33,806
Come in, Sam.

470
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:42,705
You're leaving town?

471
00:41:44,236 --> 00:41:47,072
- Where are you going?
- I don't know yet.

472
00:41:47,907 --> 00:41:50,139
That doesn't make much sense.

473
00:41:53,203 --> 00:41:55,766
You're afraid, huh? Afraid of Miller?

474
00:41:56,499 --> 00:41:57,489
No.

475
00:41:57,667 --> 00:41:59,705
Sure you are,
or you wouldn't be running.

476
00:41:59,919 --> 00:42:02,994
You got nothing to be worried about
as long as I'm around. You know that.

477
00:42:03,256 --> 00:42:05,409
I'm not scared of Miller.
I'll take him on any time.

478
00:42:05,633 --> 00:42:06,987
I believe you.

479
00:42:07,553 --> 00:42:08,953
Then why are you going?

480
00:42:10,554 --> 00:42:12,193
- You cutting out with Kane?
- Oh, Harvey.

481
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:14,428
- Then why are you going?
- What difference does it make?

482
00:42:14,642 --> 00:42:15,843
It's Kane. It's Kane, I know it's Kane.

483
00:42:16,143 --> 00:42:17,737
It isn't Kane,

484
00:42:17,937 --> 00:42:20,977
but I'm going to tell you something
about you and your friend Kane.

485
00:42:21,233 --> 00:42:22,553
You're a good-looking boy.

486
00:42:22,734 --> 00:42:26,174
You have big, broad shoulders,
but he is a man.

487
00:42:26,446 --> 00:42:29,121
It takes more than big, broad shoulders
to make a man, Harvey,

488
00:42:29,366 --> 00:42:31,324
and you have a long way to go.

489
00:42:33,454 --> 00:42:36,130
You know something?
I don't think you will ever make it.

490
00:42:38,875 --> 00:42:40,947
Let me tell you something.
You're not going anywhere.

491
00:42:41,169 --> 00:42:44,528
You're staying here with me.
It's going to be just like it was before.

492
00:42:49,511 --> 00:42:51,629
You want to know why I'm leaving?
Then listen.

493
00:42:52,556 --> 00:42:54,389
Kane will be a dead man in half an hour,

494
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,832
and nobody is going to do
anything about it.

495
00:42:57,061 --> 00:43:01,058
And when he dies, this town dies, too.
I can feel it.

496
00:43:01,481 --> 00:43:03,201
I am all alone in the world.

497
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:07,556
I have to make a living.
So I'm going someplace else. That's all.

498
00:43:11,742 --> 00:43:15,022
And as for you, I don't like anybody
to put his hands on me

499
00:43:15,287 --> 00:43:16,403
unless I want him to.

500
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:19,256
And I don't like you to anymore.

501
00:43:36,435 --> 00:43:39,589
Our text today is from Malachi,
Chapter Four.

502
00:43:39,979 --> 00:43:43,611
"For, behold, the day cometh,
that shall burn as an oven,

503
00:43:44,234 --> 00:43:47,309
"and all the proud, yea,
and all that do wickedly, shall be..."

504
00:43:52,075 --> 00:43:53,270
Yes?

505
00:43:53,743 --> 00:43:56,543
I'm sorry, Parson.
I don't want to disturb the services.

506
00:43:57,373 --> 00:43:59,013
You already have.

507
00:43:59,208 --> 00:44:01,884
You don't come
to this church very often, Marshal.

508
00:44:02,128 --> 00:44:05,328
And when you got married today,
you didn't see fit to be married here.

509
00:44:05,881 --> 00:44:08,397
What could be so important
to bring you here now?

510
00:44:09,385 --> 00:44:10,820
I need help.

511
00:44:16,392 --> 00:44:18,191
It's true, I haven't been
a church-going man.

512
00:44:18,394 --> 00:44:20,114
And maybe that's a bad thing.

513
00:44:20,314 --> 00:44:23,628
And I didn't get married here today
because my wife's a Quaker.

514
00:44:24,527 --> 00:44:28,079
But I came here for help
because there are people here.

515
00:44:30,114 --> 00:44:31,515
I'm sorry, Marshal.

516
00:44:32,451 --> 00:44:34,090
Say what you have to say.

517
00:44:35,955 --> 00:44:37,834
Maybe some of you already know it,

518
00:44:38,039 --> 00:44:39,520
but if you don't,

519
00:44:39,708 --> 00:44:42,669
it looks like Frank Miller's
coming back on the noon train.

520
00:44:46,549 --> 00:44:49,703
I need all the special deputies I can get.

521
00:44:55,099 --> 00:44:59,655
Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go.

522
00:45:01,939 --> 00:45:03,897
Hold it a minute. Hold it.

523
00:45:04,484 --> 00:45:05,759
Before we go
rushing out into something

524
00:45:05,943 --> 00:45:07,378
that ain't gonna be so pleasant,

525
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:09,642
let's be sure
we know what this is all about.

526
00:45:11,115 --> 00:45:12,948
What I want to know is this.

527
00:45:13,159 --> 00:45:15,915
Ain't it true
that Kane ain't no longer marshal?

528
00:45:17,748 --> 00:45:20,902
And ain't it true there's personal trouble
between him and Miller?

529
00:45:26,005 --> 00:45:29,319
All right, all right. Quiet, everybody!

530
00:45:29,885 --> 00:45:32,686
If there's a difference of opinion,
let everybody have a say.

531
00:45:32,929 --> 00:45:34,603
But let's do it like grown-up people.

532
00:45:34,806 --> 00:45:37,403
And let's get all the kids
out of the building.

533
00:46:10,218 --> 00:46:13,770
- Anything on the train?
- It's on time as far as I know, sir.

534
00:46:18,811 --> 00:46:21,373
I say it don't really matter
if there's anything personal

535
00:46:21,603 --> 00:46:23,402
between Miller and the marshal here.

536
00:46:23,605 --> 00:46:26,076
We all know who Miller is
and what Miller is.

537
00:46:26,317 --> 00:46:28,389
What's more, we're wasting time.

538
00:46:29,029 --> 00:46:31,386
All right. Coy.

539
00:46:31,615 --> 00:46:35,294
Yes, we all know who Miller is.
But we put him away once.

540
00:46:35,576 --> 00:46:38,936
And who saved him from hanging?
The politicians up north.

541
00:46:39,289 --> 00:46:42,125
I say this is their mess.
Let them take care of it.

542
00:46:42,919 --> 00:46:45,196
- Sawyer.
- Well, I say this.

543
00:46:45,421 --> 00:46:47,015
We've been paying
good money right along

544
00:46:47,213 --> 00:46:48,694
for a marshal and deputies.

545
00:46:48,882 --> 00:46:50,555
Now the first time there's any trouble,

546
00:46:50,759 --> 00:46:52,512
we're supposed
to take care of it ourselves.

547
00:46:52,719 --> 00:46:54,916
Well, what have we been paying for
all this time?

548
00:46:55,139 --> 00:46:58,020
I say we're not peace officers.
This ain't our job.

549
00:46:59,685 --> 00:47:02,485
I've been saying right along,
we ought to have more deputies.

550
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:05,566
If we did,
we wouldn't be facing this thing now.

551
00:47:06,358 --> 00:47:09,957
Just a minute. Just a minute.
Everybody, quiet!

552
00:47:10,237 --> 00:47:13,198
Keep it orderly.
You had your hand up, Ezra.

553
00:47:14,199 --> 00:47:16,796
I can't believe I've heard some
of the things that have been said here.

554
00:47:17,037 --> 00:47:18,518
You all ought to be ashamed
of yourselves.

555
00:47:18,705 --> 00:47:22,257
Sure, we paid this man and he was
the best marshal this town ever had.

556
00:47:22,542 --> 00:47:24,340
It ain't his trouble, it's ours.

557
00:47:24,543 --> 00:47:27,697
I tell you, if we don't do what's right,
we're gonna have plenty more trouble.

558
00:47:27,963 --> 00:47:31,642
So there ain't but one thing to do now.
And you all know what that is.

559
00:47:32,011 --> 00:47:33,206
Go ahead, Kibbee.

560
00:47:33,387 --> 00:47:35,026
This whole thing's been handled wrong.

561
00:47:35,222 --> 00:47:38,217
Here's those three killers
walking the streets bold as brass.

562
00:47:38,475 --> 00:47:39,955
Why didn't you arrest them, Marshal?

563
00:47:40,143 --> 00:47:41,976
Why didn't you put them in jail
where they ought to be?

564
00:47:42,187 --> 00:47:44,658
Then we'd only have Miller to worry
about instead of the four of them.

565
00:47:44,898 --> 00:47:47,415
I haven't anything to arrest them for,
Mr Trumbull.

566
00:47:47,651 --> 00:47:49,085
They haven't done anything.

567
00:47:49,276 --> 00:47:52,556
There's no law against them
sitting on a bench at the depot.

568
00:47:52,948 --> 00:47:54,668
I can't listen to any more of this.

569
00:47:54,867 --> 00:47:56,700
What's the matter with you people?

570
00:47:56,910 --> 00:47:58,504
Don't you remember
when a decent woman

571
00:47:58,704 --> 00:48:00,936
couldn't walk down the street
in broad daylight?

572
00:48:01,164 --> 00:48:04,478
Don't you remember when this wasn't
a fit place to bring up a child?

573
00:48:04,753 --> 00:48:08,066
How can you sit here
and talk and talk and talk like this?

574
00:48:08,339 --> 00:48:10,457
What are we all getting
so excited about?

575
00:48:10,674 --> 00:48:13,237
How do we know
Miller's on that train, anyway?

576
00:48:13,637 --> 00:48:15,994
Well, we can be pretty sure he's on it.

577
00:48:16,389 --> 00:48:18,188
Time's getting short.

578
00:48:19,766 --> 00:48:22,442
Parson, you got anything to say?

579
00:48:22,687 --> 00:48:26,809
I don't know. The Commandments say,
"Thou shalt not kill."

580
00:48:27,108 --> 00:48:29,544
But we hire men to go out
and do it for us.

581
00:48:30,027 --> 00:48:32,669
The right and the wrong
seem pretty clear here.

582
00:48:33,449 --> 00:48:36,250
But if you're asking me to tell my people
to go out and kill

583
00:48:36,493 --> 00:48:38,451
and maybe get themselves killed,

584
00:48:38,786 --> 00:48:42,863
I'm sorry, I don't know what to say.
I'm sorry.

585
00:48:44,376 --> 00:48:46,494
All right. I'll say this,

586
00:48:46,711 --> 00:48:49,467
what this town owes Will Kane here,
it can never pay with money.

587
00:48:49,715 --> 00:48:51,309
And don't ever forget it.

588
00:48:51,969 --> 00:48:55,567
He's the best marshal we ever had,
maybe the best marshal we'll ever have.

589
00:48:55,846 --> 00:49:00,322
So if Miller comes back here today,
it's our problem, not his.

590
00:49:00,851 --> 00:49:03,812
It's our problem
because this is our town.

591
00:49:04,064 --> 00:49:06,341
We made it with our own hands
out of nothing.

592
00:49:06,565 --> 00:49:08,843
And if we want to keep it decent,
keep it growing,

593
00:49:09,069 --> 00:49:10,948
we've got to think mighty clear
here today.

594
00:49:11,154 --> 00:49:13,750
And we've got to have the courage
to do what we think is right,

595
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:16,905
no matter how hard it is. All right.

596
00:49:17,743 --> 00:49:20,704
There's gonna be fighting
when Kane and Miller meet.

597
00:49:20,956 --> 00:49:24,794
And somebody's going to get hurt,
that's for sure. Now,

598
00:49:25,584 --> 00:49:28,465
people up north
are thinking about this town.

599
00:49:28,714 --> 00:49:31,915
Thinking mighty hard, thinking about
sending money down here

600
00:49:32,174 --> 00:49:34,531
to put up stores and to build factories.

601
00:49:35,011 --> 00:49:38,051
It'll mean a lot to this town. An awful lot.

602
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:42,193
But if they're gonna read about
shooting and killing in the streets,

603
00:49:42,477 --> 00:49:44,390
what are they gonna think then?

604
00:49:44,647 --> 00:49:49,281
I'll tell you. They're gonna think
this is just another wide-open town,

605
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:52,571
and everything we worked for
will be wiped out.

606
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:57,264
In one day,
this town will be set back five years.

607
00:49:57,785 --> 00:50:00,221
And I don't think we can let that happen.

608
00:50:00,579 --> 00:50:03,699
Mind you, you all know
how I feel about this man.

609
00:50:04,416 --> 00:50:06,728
He's a mighty brave man. A good man.

610
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:09,774
He didn't have to come back here today.

611
00:50:10,422 --> 00:50:13,941
And for his sake and the sake
of this town, I wish he hadn't.

612
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,911
Because if he's not here
when Miller comes,

613
00:50:18,139 --> 00:50:21,054
my hunch is there won't be any trouble.
Not one bit.

614
00:50:21,308 --> 00:50:22,948
Tomorrow we'll have a new marshal,

615
00:50:23,144 --> 00:50:26,139
and if we can all agree here
to offer him our services,

616
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:29,156
I think we can handle anything
that comes along.

617
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:31,708
Now, to me, that makes sense.

618
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:34,723
To me, that's the only way out of this.

619
00:50:36,323 --> 00:50:40,240
Will, I think you better go
while there's still time.

620
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:45,208
It's better for you, and it's better for us.

621
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:57,120
Thanks.

622
00:51:27,669 --> 00:51:30,140
Why don't you put that thing away?

623
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:48,424
- Bang, bang, bang!
- Bang, bang, you're dead, Kane!

624
00:52:26,814 --> 00:52:30,777
- I sent a kid to find you. Didn't he come?
- He was here.

625
00:52:34,905 --> 00:52:37,866
You've been my friend all my life.
You got me this job.

626
00:52:38,117 --> 00:52:39,950
You made them send for me.

627
00:52:40,828 --> 00:52:44,028
Ever since I was a kid,
I wanted to be like you, Mart.

628
00:52:44,289 --> 00:52:46,168
You've been a lawman all your life.

629
00:52:46,374 --> 00:52:48,686
Yeah, yeah, all my life.

630
00:52:48,919 --> 00:52:52,198
It's a great life.
You risk your skin catching killers,

631
00:52:52,464 --> 00:52:56,302
and the juries turn them loose so they
can come back and shoot at you again.

632
00:52:56,593 --> 00:52:59,155
If you're honest,
you're poor your whole life.

633
00:52:59,388 --> 00:53:03,385
And in the end, you wind up dying
all alone on some dirty street.

634
00:53:03,685 --> 00:53:04,641
For what?

635
00:53:05,435 --> 00:53:08,316
For nothing. For a tin star.

636
00:53:08,982 --> 00:53:11,054
Listen, the judge has left town,

637
00:53:11,274 --> 00:53:13,745
Harvey's quit,
and I'm having trouble getting deputies.

638
00:53:13,987 --> 00:53:16,629
It figures. It's all happened too sudden.

639
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,843
People got to talk themselves
into law and order

640
00:53:20,075 --> 00:53:21,635
before they do anything about it.

641
00:53:21,827 --> 00:53:26,508
Maybe because down deep
they don't care. They just don't care.

642
00:53:33,297 --> 00:53:34,778
What'll I do, Mart?

643
00:53:37,887 --> 00:53:40,164
I was hoping you wouldn't come back.

644
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,074
You know why I came back.

645
00:53:42,265 --> 00:53:44,223
Well, not to commit suicide.

646
00:53:45,477 --> 00:53:48,756
Sometimes...
Sometimes prison changes a man.

647
00:53:49,023 --> 00:53:53,306
Not him. This is all planned.
That's why they're all here.

648
00:53:54,194 --> 00:53:56,552
Get out, Will. Get out.

649
00:54:07,748 --> 00:54:09,866
Will you come down
to that depot with me?

650
00:54:10,085 --> 00:54:11,122
No.

651
00:54:13,339 --> 00:54:17,177
You know how I feel about you.
But I ain't going with you.

652
00:54:18,136 --> 00:54:22,213
Seems like a man with busted knuckles
didn't need arthritis, too, don't it?

653
00:54:23,598 --> 00:54:26,957
No, I couldn't do nothing for you.
You'd be worried about me.

654
00:54:27,229 --> 00:54:30,065
You'd get yourself killed
worrying about me.

655
00:54:30,315 --> 00:54:32,751
It's too one-sided like it is.

656
00:54:39,116 --> 00:54:41,313
- So long, Mart.
- So long.

657
00:54:43,246 --> 00:54:47,766
It's all for nothing, Will.
It's all for nothing.

658
00:54:58,969 --> 00:55:02,886
Excuse me,
what is Mrs Ramírez's room number?

659
00:55:04,182 --> 00:55:06,220
- Three.
- Thank you.

660
00:55:23,493 --> 00:55:24,723
Come in.

661
00:55:28,374 --> 00:55:31,848
- Yes?
- Mrs Ramírez? I'm Mrs Kane.

662
00:55:32,712 --> 00:55:33,862
I know.

663
00:55:36,216 --> 00:55:38,653
- May I come in?
- If you like.

664
00:55:44,933 --> 00:55:47,529
- Sit down, Mrs Kane.
- No, thank you.

665
00:55:48,062 --> 00:55:50,020
- What do you want?
- Oh, please...

666
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:53,430
It's just that I'm afraid if I sat down,
I wouldn't be able to get up again.

667
00:55:53,692 --> 00:55:56,492
- Why?
- It wasn't easy for me to come here.

668
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:57,856
Why?

669
00:55:58,614 --> 00:56:02,007
Look, Mrs Ramírez,
Will and I were married an hour ago.

670
00:56:02,283 --> 00:56:04,321
We were all packed and ready to leave,

671
00:56:04,537 --> 00:56:06,928
and then this thing happened
and he wouldn't go.

672
00:56:07,163 --> 00:56:11,319
I did everything. I pleaded, I threatened,
I just couldn't reach him.

673
00:56:12,378 --> 00:56:16,295
- And now?
- Well, that man downstairs, the clerk,

674
00:56:17,132 --> 00:56:19,170
he said things about you and Will.

675
00:56:20,093 --> 00:56:22,610
I've been trying to understand
why he wouldn't go with me,

676
00:56:22,847 --> 00:56:26,286
and now all I can think of
is that it's got to be because of you.

677
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:28,073
What do you want from me?

678
00:56:28,269 --> 00:56:31,424
Let him go. He still has a chance.
Let him go.

679
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:35,003
- I cannot help you.
- Please.

680
00:56:35,275 --> 00:56:37,348
He isn't staying for me.

681
00:56:37,946 --> 00:56:40,827
I haven't spoken to him for a year
until today.

682
00:56:44,661 --> 00:56:49,022
- I am leaving on the same train you are.
- Then what is it? Why is he staying?

683
00:56:50,125 --> 00:56:53,678
If you don't know,
I cannot explain it to you.

684
00:56:56,173 --> 00:56:59,532
Well, thank you, anyway.
You've been very kind.

685
00:57:01,512 --> 00:57:05,395
What kind of woman are you?
How can you leave him like this?

686
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:08,691
Does the sound of guns
frighten you that much?

687
00:57:09,019 --> 00:57:11,582
No, Mrs Ramírez, I've heard guns.

688
00:57:12,356 --> 00:57:14,872
My father and my brother
were killed by guns.

689
00:57:15,569 --> 00:57:16,685
They were on the right side,

690
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:19,582
but that didn't help them any
when the shooting started.

691
00:57:19,822 --> 00:57:23,057
My brother was 19. I watched him die.

692
00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:29,170
That's when I became a Quaker.
I don't care who's right or who's wrong.

693
00:57:29,873 --> 00:57:32,994
There's got to be some better way
for people to live.

694
00:57:35,965 --> 00:57:38,197
Will knows how I feel about it.

695
00:57:39,301 --> 00:57:42,853
Just a minute. Are you going
to wait for the train downstairs?

696
00:57:43,762 --> 00:57:46,199
- Yes.
- Why don't you wait here?

697
00:58:02,825 --> 00:58:06,104
Well, I got no use for Kane,
but I'll say this, he's got guts.

698
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:08,727
You're mighty broad-minded, Joe.

699
00:58:13,086 --> 00:58:15,079
Now, you, Harv,
I always figured you for guts,

700
00:58:15,296 --> 00:58:17,573
but I never gave you any credit
for brains, till now.

701
00:58:17,799 --> 00:58:19,392
What's that mean?

702
00:58:20,259 --> 00:58:24,017
Nothing. Only it takes a smart man
to know when to back away.

703
00:58:26,850 --> 00:58:31,132
If I can't pick my company when I drink
in here, I ain't coming in here anymore.

704
00:58:32,064 --> 00:58:35,139
Okay. All right.

705
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:38,201
Look at the boy with the tin star.

706
00:58:38,444 --> 00:58:40,915
All right, if that's the way you want it.

707
00:58:44,326 --> 00:58:46,797
All right, boys,
what are you going to have?

708
01:00:04,949 --> 01:00:08,309
Put a saddle on him, Kane.
Go on, saddle him up.

709
01:00:08,995 --> 01:00:10,635
He'll go a long way before he tires.

710
01:00:10,832 --> 01:00:12,586
That's what you were thinking,
wasn't it?

711
01:00:12,792 --> 01:00:14,625
- Kind of.
- You scared?

712
01:00:16,587 --> 01:00:17,737
I guess so.

713
01:00:19,673 --> 01:00:22,031
Sure. It stands to reason.

714
01:00:25,055 --> 01:00:27,890
Come on, let me help you.

715
01:00:33,855 --> 01:00:36,247
Seems like all everybody
and his brother wants

716
01:00:36,484 --> 01:00:37,679
is to get me out of town.

717
01:00:37,858 --> 01:00:40,216
Well, nobody wants
to see you get killed.

718
01:00:43,198 --> 01:00:44,314
Hold it. Where are you going?

719
01:00:44,490 --> 01:00:45,925
I don't know. Back to the office, I guess.

720
01:00:46,118 --> 01:00:48,999
Oh, no. You're getting on that horse
and you're getting out.

721
01:00:49,247 --> 01:00:50,921
What's the matter with you?

722
01:00:51,122 --> 01:00:53,684
You were ready to do it yourself.
You said so.

723
01:00:54,209 --> 01:00:55,359
Look, Harv.

724
01:00:55,543 --> 01:00:57,776
I thought about it because I was tired.

725
01:00:58,006 --> 01:01:00,283
You think about a lot of things
when you're tired.

726
01:01:00,507 --> 01:01:02,545
- But I can't do it.
- Why?

727
01:01:03,052 --> 01:01:04,486
I don't know.

728
01:01:05,344 --> 01:01:06,938
Get on that horse, Will.

729
01:01:08,766 --> 01:01:11,601
Why is it so important to you?
You don't care if I live or die.

730
01:01:11,852 --> 01:01:13,081
Come on.

731
01:01:13,772 --> 01:01:16,847
Don't shove me, Harv.
I'm tired of being shoved.

732
01:03:01,339 --> 01:03:04,334
I hate this town. I always hated it.

733
01:03:05,885 --> 01:03:08,880
To be a Mexican woman
in a town like this.

734
01:03:09,432 --> 01:03:10,582
I understand.

735
01:03:12,685 --> 01:03:14,678
You do? That's good.

736
01:03:14,895 --> 01:03:18,448
I don't understand you.
No matter what you say.

737
01:03:18,940 --> 01:03:21,662
If Kane was my man,
I'd never leave him like this.

738
01:03:21,903 --> 01:03:23,782
I'd get a gun. I'd fight.

739
01:03:23,988 --> 01:03:25,104
Why don't you?

740
01:03:27,116 --> 01:03:29,712
He is not my man. He's yours.

741
01:03:49,389 --> 01:03:51,906
You got some clean water I can use?

742
01:03:52,141 --> 01:03:55,500
Why, sure, Marshal. Sure, sure.
Sit down.

743
01:04:02,903 --> 01:04:05,021
Run into some kind of trouble, Marshal?

744
01:04:05,239 --> 01:04:06,833
No, no trouble.

745
01:04:11,370 --> 01:04:14,604
- What are you building?
- Oh, just fixing things up out back.

746
01:04:14,873 --> 01:04:17,868
Now take it easy, Mr Kane.
Just settle back. That's it.

747
01:04:21,256 --> 01:04:23,567
- Fred, Fred, hold it a while, will you?
- Hold it?

748
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:25,393
You just stop till I tell you to start again.

749
01:04:44,571 --> 01:04:46,723
- Thanks.
- You're welcome, Marshal.

750
01:04:47,198 --> 01:04:48,348
No charge...

751
01:04:48,535 --> 01:04:51,256
You can tell your man
he can go back to work now.

752
01:05:16,479 --> 01:05:17,435
Will!

753
01:05:17,604 --> 01:05:20,997
I guess I forgot about you, Herb.
I'm sure glad you're here.

754
01:05:21,276 --> 01:05:23,108
I couldn't figure out
what was keeping you.

755
01:05:23,319 --> 01:05:25,630
- Time's getting pretty short.
- Sure is.

756
01:05:25,864 --> 01:05:29,018
When are the other boys gonna
get here? We got to make plans.

757
01:05:29,282 --> 01:05:31,878
The other boys?
There aren't any other boys, Herb.

758
01:05:32,119 --> 01:05:34,397
- It's just you and me.
- You're joking.

759
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:36,997
No, I couldn't get anybody.

760
01:05:38,001 --> 01:05:40,916
I don't believe it.
This town ain't that low.

761
01:05:41,253 --> 01:05:42,972
I couldn't get anybody.

762
01:05:43,589 --> 01:05:46,152
- Then it's just you and me.
- I guess so.

763
01:05:46,384 --> 01:05:49,220
You and me against Miller
and all the rest of them?

764
01:05:50,180 --> 01:05:52,696
That's right. Do you want out, Herb?

765
01:05:53,142 --> 01:05:56,979
Well, it isn't that I want out, no.

766
01:05:57,854 --> 01:05:59,972
You see... Look, I'll tell you the truth.

767
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:03,469
- I didn't figure on anything like this, Will.
- Neither did I.

768
01:06:03,736 --> 01:06:05,171
I volunteered. You know I did.

769
01:06:05,362 --> 01:06:07,082
You didn't have to come to me.
I was ready.

770
01:06:07,281 --> 01:06:10,401
Sure, I'm ready now.
But this is different, Will.

771
01:06:10,659 --> 01:06:12,458
This ain't like
what you said it was gonna be.

772
01:06:12,661 --> 01:06:14,938
This is just plain committing suicide.
And for what?

773
01:06:15,164 --> 01:06:17,441
Why me? I'm no lawman.
I just live here.

774
01:06:17,666 --> 01:06:21,026
I got nothing personal against nobody.
I got no stake in this.

775
01:06:22,088 --> 01:06:23,522
I guess not.

776
01:06:24,339 --> 01:06:26,218
There's a limit
how much you can ask a man.

777
01:06:26,425 --> 01:06:28,816
I got a wife and kids.
What about my kids?

778
01:06:30,014 --> 01:06:31,893
Go on home to your kids, Herb.

779
01:06:37,062 --> 01:06:40,102
You get some of the other fellows, Will,
and I'll still go through with it.

780
01:06:40,356 --> 01:06:42,076
Go on home, Herb.

781
01:07:08,762 --> 01:07:10,355
What do you want?

782
01:07:10,554 --> 01:07:12,512
I found them, Marshal,
like you wanted me to.

783
01:07:12,723 --> 01:07:16,196
- All but Mr Henderson.
- I found him. Thanks.

784
01:07:16,476 --> 01:07:17,911
You're welcome.

785
01:07:19,272 --> 01:07:23,110
Marshal, listen. Let me fight with you.
I ain't afraid.

786
01:07:24,276 --> 01:07:26,839
- No.
- Please let me, Marshal.

787
01:07:27,947 --> 01:07:29,746
You're a kid. You're a baby.

788
01:07:30,033 --> 01:07:33,028
I'm 16. And I can handle a gun, too.
You ought to see me.

789
01:07:33,495 --> 01:07:35,614
You're 14.
And what do you want to lie for?

790
01:07:35,830 --> 01:07:38,870
Well, I'm big for my age.
Please, Marshal.

791
01:07:39,125 --> 01:07:41,562
Well, you're big for your age all right,
but, no.

792
01:07:41,795 --> 01:07:44,072
Go on. Get out of here. Go on.

793
01:10:53,535 --> 01:10:56,176
Hey, Charlie, you can go home now.

794
01:10:58,747 --> 01:10:59,976
Thanks, Marshal.

795
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:06,242
I sure appreciate it. I certainly do.

796
01:11:12,969 --> 01:11:15,566
You don't happen to know
if the saloon's open, do you, Will?

797
01:11:15,806 --> 01:11:18,083
- I said go home, Charlie.
- Yes, sir.

798
01:11:24,773 --> 01:11:27,050
- So long, Helen.
- Goodbye, Sam.

799
01:11:27,277 --> 01:11:28,393
Take care.

800
01:13:03,792 --> 01:13:06,513
- Hello, Frank.
- How are you, Frank?

801
01:13:06,962 --> 01:13:09,194
- Everything ready?
- Sure. Just the way you want it, Frank.

802
01:13:09,422 --> 01:13:13,055
- Yeah, we got your gun over here.
- Let's get started, then.

803
01:15:37,868 --> 01:15:40,509
- Can't you wait?
- Just want to be ready.

804
01:16:33,006 --> 01:16:34,360
Miller.

805
01:20:13,858 --> 01:20:15,008
Go!

806
01:23:04,493 --> 01:23:06,326
All right, Kane. Come on out.

807
01:23:06,579 --> 01:23:09,892
Come out, or your friend here
will get it the way Pierce did.

808
01:23:12,208 --> 01:23:14,201
I'll come out. Let her go.

809
01:23:14,419 --> 01:23:16,661
As soon as you walk through that door.
Come on. I'll hold my fire.
