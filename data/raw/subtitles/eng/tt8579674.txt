2
00:01:29,766 --> 00:01:31,518
Blake.

3
00:01:32,262 --> 00:01:34,105
Blake!

4
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:36,105
Sorry, Sarge.

5
00:01:36,205 --> 00:01:39,480
Pick a man, bring your kit.

6
00:01:39,784 --> 00:01:41,493
Yes, Sarge.

7
00:02:03,262 --> 00:02:06,097
- Don't dawdle.
- No, Sarge.

8
00:02:15,391 --> 00:02:17,250
Did they feed us?

9
00:02:17,407 --> 00:02:20,296
No, just mail.

10
00:02:40,321 --> 00:02:42,364
Myrtle's having puppies.

11
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,212
You get anything?

12
00:02:46,404 --> 00:02:48,063
No.

13
00:02:49,687 --> 00:02:52,264
I'm bloody starving, aren't you?

14
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:55,370
I thought we might get
some decent grub out here.

15
00:02:55,434 --> 00:02:58,966
It was the only reason
I decided against the priesthood.

16
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,673
- What you got there?
- Ham and bread.

17
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,750
Where did you find that?

18
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:11,198
I have my uses.

19
00:03:12,773 --> 00:03:14,337
Here.

20
00:03:19,413 --> 00:03:21,486
Tastes like old shoe.

21
00:03:21,648 --> 00:03:25,269
Cheer up. This time next week
it'll be chicken dinner.

22
00:03:25,861 --> 00:03:29,950
Not me. My leave got cancelled.

23
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,979
They say why?

24
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:34,026
No idea.

25
00:03:35,188 --> 00:03:37,683
It's easier not to go back at all.

26
00:03:48,425 --> 00:03:51,179
Something's up.
Did you hear anything?

27
00:03:51,321 --> 00:03:52,629
No.

28
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,706
Has to be the push, right?

29
00:03:56,741 --> 00:03:59,407
Ten-bob says we're going up.

30
00:03:59,558 --> 00:04:01,383
I'm not taking that bet.

31
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:03,365
Why? 'Cos you know I'm right?

32
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,005
No. Because you haven't got ten-bob.

33
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:12,747
In your own time, gentlemen.

34
00:04:12,821 --> 00:04:15,181
- Is there any news, Sarge?
- News of what?

35
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,583
The big push.

36
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:19,770
It was supposed to happen weeks ago.
They told us we'd be home by Christmas.

37
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:22,198
Yes, well, sorry to disrupt
your crowded schedule, Blake,

38
00:04:22,198 --> 00:04:24,414
but the Brass Hats
didn't fancy it in the snow.

39
00:04:24,414 --> 00:04:27,023
More's the pity, Sarge,
I could've done with some turkey.

40
00:04:27,023 --> 00:04:29,937
Well, I'll make sure to relay
your displeasure to command.

41
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,860
So, what's on the cards then, Sergeant?

42
00:04:32,001 --> 00:04:33,801
The Hun are up to something.

43
00:04:33,801 --> 00:04:35,913
- Any idea what?
- No.

44
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:38,629
But it's bound to ruin
our weekend.

45
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,666
Now listen, Erinmore is inside,
so tidy yourselves up.

46
00:04:50,285 --> 00:04:51,595
Never know -

47
00:04:51,695 --> 00:04:54,572
might be mentions
in dispatches for this one,

48
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:57,572
if you don't bugger it up.

49
00:05:00,162 --> 00:05:03,021
Must be something big
if the General's here.

50
00:05:12,526 --> 00:05:15,809
Lance Corporals
Blake and Schofield, Sir.

51
00:05:17,594 --> 00:05:20,423
- Which one of you is Blake?
- Sir.

52
00:05:20,748 --> 00:05:24,040
You have a brother,
a Lieutenant in the 2nd Devons?

53
00:05:24,071 --> 00:05:26,364
Yes, sir.
Joseph Blake, is he...?

54
00:05:26,364 --> 00:05:29,007
Alive, as far as I know.

55
00:05:29,299 --> 00:05:32,312
And with your help
I'd like to keep it that way.

56
00:05:32,739 --> 00:05:35,297
Sanders tells me you're good
with maps, is that true?

57
00:05:35,757 --> 00:05:37,768
Good enough, Sir.

58
00:05:38,097 --> 00:05:39,672
So.

59
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,628
We are here.

60
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:47,132
The 2nd Devons are advancing here.

61
00:05:47,424 --> 00:05:49,638
How long will it take you
to get there?

62
00:05:50,826 --> 00:05:52,480
I don't understand, Sir.

63
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,049
Sir, that land is held
by the Germans.

64
00:05:54,049 --> 00:05:56,282
Germans have gone.

65
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:01,474
Don't get your hopes up.
It appears to be a strategic withdrawal.

66
00:06:02,126 --> 00:06:06,410
They seem to have created a new line,
nine miles back here, by the looks of it.

67
00:06:06,495 --> 00:06:09,368
Colonel MacKenzie is in command
of the 2nd.

68
00:06:09,739 --> 00:06:14,174
He sent word yesterday morning
he was going after the retreating Germans.

69
00:06:14,446 --> 00:06:16,922
He is convinced
he has them on the run -

70
00:06:16,922 --> 00:06:20,394
that if he can break their lines now,
he will turn the tide.

71
00:06:21,305 --> 00:06:22,731
He is wrong.

72
00:06:22,998 --> 00:06:27,707
Colonel MacKenzie has not seen
these aerials of the enemy's new line.

73
00:06:27,707 --> 00:06:30,046
Come round here, Gentlemen.

74
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:35,044
Three miles deep, field fortifications,
defences, artillery,

75
00:06:35,044 --> 00:06:37,424
the like of which we've
never seen before.

76
00:06:38,589 --> 00:06:42,119
The 2nd are due to attack the line
shortly after dawn tomorrow.

77
00:06:42,262 --> 00:06:44,896
They have no idea
what they are in for.

78
00:06:45,044 --> 00:06:47,254
And we can't warn them -
as a parting gift,

79
00:06:47,254 --> 00:06:49,948
the enemy cut
all our telegram lines.

80
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,580
Your orders are to get to the 2nd

81
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:56,633
at Croisilles Wood, one mile
south-east of the town of Ecoust.

82
00:06:56,919 --> 00:06:59,002
Deliver this to Colonel MacKenzie.

83
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:02,256
It is a direct order to call off
tomorrow morning's attack.

84
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:05,357
If you don't,
it will be a massacre.

85
00:07:05,512 --> 00:07:10,299
We would lose two battalions.
1600 men, your brother among them.

86
00:07:10,903 --> 00:07:13,001
You think you can get there in time?

87
00:07:13,001 --> 00:07:15,143
- Yes, Sir.
- Any questions?

88
00:07:15,604 --> 00:07:17,094
- No, Sir.
- Good.

89
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:19,323
Over to you, Lieutenant.

90
00:07:21,672 --> 00:07:23,594
Supplies, Gentlemen.

91
00:07:24,454 --> 00:07:29,124
Map, torches, grenades,
and a couple of little treats.

92
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,837
Leave immediately, take this trench west,
up on Sauchiehall Street,

93
00:07:32,837 --> 00:07:35,238
then north-west
on Paradise Alley at the front.

94
00:07:35,438 --> 00:07:38,293
Continue along the front line
until you find the Yorks.

95
00:07:38,437 --> 00:07:40,531
Give this note to Major Stevenson.
He's holding the line

96
00:07:40,531 --> 00:07:42,650
at the shortest span
of No Man's Land.

97
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,534
You'll cross there.

98
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,724
It will be daylight, Sir.
They'll see us.

99
00:07:46,724 --> 00:07:50,049
There's no need to be concerned.
You should meet no resistance.

100
00:07:56,148 --> 00:07:59,144
Sir, is it just us?

101
00:07:59,662 --> 00:08:04,939
"Down to Gehenna or up to the Throne,
He travels the fastest who travels alone."

102
00:08:05,106 --> 00:08:08,397
- Wouldn't you say, Lieutenant?
- Yes, Sir. I would.

103
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,987
Good luck.

104
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,666
Blake - let's talk about this
for a minute.

105
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:24,978
Why?

106
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:34,200
Blake!

107
00:08:41,016 --> 00:08:42,351
We just need to think about it.

108
00:08:42,351 --> 00:08:44,639
There's nothing to think about.
He's my big brother.

109
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:46,267
We should at least wait
until it's dark.

110
00:08:46,267 --> 00:08:48,130
Erinmore said to leave immediately.

111
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:50,252
Erinmore's never seen
No Man's Land.

112
00:08:50,252 --> 00:08:52,867
We won't make it 10 yards.
If we just wait.

113
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:55,632
You heard him.
He said the Boche have gone.

114
00:08:55,928 --> 00:08:58,350
Is that why he gave us grenades?

115
00:09:09,038 --> 00:09:11,361
- Watch where you're going!
- Sorry.

116
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,562
All I'm saying is that we wait.

117
00:09:22,826 --> 00:09:26,181
Yes, you would say that,
because he's not your brother, is it?

118
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,617
Look, the last time I was told
the Germans were gone, it didn't end well.

119
00:09:33,285 --> 00:09:35,679
You don't know, Blake,
you weren't there.

120
00:09:38,213 --> 00:09:40,562
Excuse me. Excuse me!

121
00:09:46,444 --> 00:09:48,478
You're going up a down trench
you bloody idiots.

122
00:09:48,478 --> 00:09:50,514
Orders of the General, Sir.

123
00:10:02,844 --> 00:10:05,437
Alright, say the Boche have gone.

124
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:09,172
Nine miles will take us, what, six hours?
Eight at the very most.

125
00:10:09,324 --> 00:10:11,419
So, we've got time
to wait until the sun sets...

126
00:10:11,419 --> 00:10:14,538
It's enemy territory, we've got
no idea what we're walking into.

127
00:10:14,538 --> 00:10:19,254
Blake, if we're not clever about this,
no one will get to your brother.

128
00:10:19,735 --> 00:10:21,355
I will.

129
00:10:23,285 --> 00:10:26,216
We're here.
This is the front line.

130
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:30,246
Now we need to find the Yorks.

131
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,397
- Watch who you're shoving.
- Get out of the way then.

132
00:11:19,397 --> 00:11:22,132
Who the fuck do you think you are,
pushing wounded soldiers around?

133
00:11:22,132 --> 00:11:22,947
Let go of me!

134
00:11:22,947 --> 00:11:25,845
Arsehole knocked down our Sergeant,
the man's fucking wounded!

135
00:11:25,845 --> 00:11:27,739
I'm sorry, alright, I'm sorry.

136
00:11:27,739 --> 00:11:28,909
- We're on commission.
- Just let me through.

137
00:11:28,909 --> 00:11:30,910
- Orders from the General.
- Just let me through.

138
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:34,270
Get out of the way.

139
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,426
Right. Just watch
where you're going.

140
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,448
It's bloody quiet.

141
00:12:09,841 --> 00:12:11,903
Was it like this before Thiepval?

142
00:12:12,336 --> 00:12:13,916
I don't remember.

143
00:12:14,345 --> 00:12:16,172
You don't remember the Somme?

144
00:12:16,213 --> 00:12:17,753
Not really.

145
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:25,154
Well, you did alright out of it.
At least wear your ribbon.

146
00:12:26,038 --> 00:12:27,711
Don't have it anymore.

147
00:12:28,362 --> 00:12:31,050
What? You lost your medal?

148
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,017
It's down, boys.

149
00:12:40,006 --> 00:12:41,657
Stay low.

150
00:12:48,297 --> 00:12:51,543
God's sake, careful there,
you're stepping on the dead.

151
00:12:51,543 --> 00:12:53,049
That's our Sergeant.

152
00:12:53,313 --> 00:12:55,678
Be better washing them out of this
dugout with a bloody hose.

153
00:12:55,678 --> 00:12:57,686
Do you know where the Yorks are?

154
00:12:57,686 --> 00:12:59,992
The next bend you'll be standing
on top of half of them.

155
00:12:59,992 --> 00:13:02,140
Shot to hell two nights ago.

156
00:13:11,193 --> 00:13:12,538
Yorks?

157
00:13:12,538 --> 00:13:13,826
Yes, Corp.

158
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:15,531
Where's Major Stevenson?

159
00:13:15,564 --> 00:13:18,269
Was killed a couple of nights ago,
Corporal.

160
00:13:18,613 --> 00:13:20,366
Lieutenant Leslie has command.

161
00:13:20,524 --> 00:13:22,303
Where can we find him?

162
00:13:22,445 --> 00:13:24,236
Next dug-out.

163
00:13:31,668 --> 00:13:33,179
Here.

164
00:13:38,022 --> 00:13:40,991
Sir? Lieutenant Leslie, Sir?

165
00:13:41,104 --> 00:13:41,912
What is it?

166
00:13:41,912 --> 00:13:43,853
We have a message
from General Erinmore.

167
00:13:43,861 --> 00:13:45,725
- Are you our relief?
- No, Sir.

168
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:47,706
Then, when the fucking hell
are they due?

169
00:13:47,706 --> 00:13:50,396
We don't know, Sir.
But we've got orders to cross here.

170
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:53,283
- That is the German front line.
- We know, Sir.

171
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,649
If you'll just take the letter.

172
00:13:57,486 --> 00:13:59,707
Settle a bet, what day is it?

173
00:14:00,238 --> 00:14:01,370
Friday.

174
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,210
Friday? Well, well, well.
None of us was right.

175
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,087
This idiot thought it was Tuesday.

176
00:14:05,087 --> 00:14:06,647
Sorry, Sir.

177
00:14:07,672 --> 00:14:09,889
Are they out of their fucking minds?

178
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:13,016
One slow night, and the brass think
the Hun have just gone home.

179
00:14:13,016 --> 00:14:14,853
Do you think they're wrong, Sir?

180
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:18,383
We lost an officer
and three men two nights ago.

181
00:14:18,383 --> 00:14:20,210
They were shot to bits
patching up wire.

182
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:23,019
We dragged two of them back here.
Needn't have bothered.

183
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:26,264
Sir, the General is sure
the enemy have withdrawn.

184
00:14:26,264 --> 00:14:27,652
There are aerials
of the new line...

185
00:14:27,752 --> 00:14:30,952
Shut up. We've fought and died
over every inch of this fucking place,

186
00:14:30,952 --> 00:14:33,929
now they suddenly give us miles?
It's a trap.

187
00:14:37,191 --> 00:14:39,505
But, chin up.
There's a medal in it for sure.

188
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:42,929
Nothing like a scrap of ribbon
to cheer up a widow.

189
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,826
Alright.

190
00:14:49,298 --> 00:14:50,937
Where's the nearest
way through, Sir?

191
00:14:50,937 --> 00:14:53,717
Our wire's a mess.
But there is a path through, of sorts.

192
00:14:53,984 --> 00:14:56,523
Rushworth! Let him look.

193
00:15:01,226 --> 00:15:03,139
Straight ahead, to the left,
past the dead horses.

194
00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:05,298
There's a gap directly behind them.

195
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,812
Useful, because if it's dark
you follow the stench.

196
00:15:08,883 --> 00:15:12,690
When you get to the second wire,
look out for the bowing chap.

197
00:15:12,905 --> 00:15:14,754
There's small break
just beside him.

198
00:15:14,754 --> 00:15:17,961
The German line
is a 150 odd yards after that.

199
00:15:18,235 --> 00:15:21,080
Watch out for the craters.
They're deeper than they look.

200
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,428
You fall in, there's no getting out.
This way.

201
00:15:26,369 --> 00:15:29,263
Wake up, Kilgour.
Bloody waste of space.

202
00:15:29,363 --> 00:15:31,469
Any cover, Sir?
Anywhere to jump off from?

203
00:15:31,469 --> 00:15:33,750
No, the sap trench
was blown to hell weeks ago.

204
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:37,643
It's full of bodies anyway.
Your best bet is to pop over here.

205
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:43,371
If you do get shot,
try to make it back to the wire.

206
00:15:43,471 --> 00:15:45,695
We won't come after you,
not until it's dark.

207
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:49,706
And, if by some fucking miracle
you do make it, send up a flare.

208
00:15:49,806 --> 00:15:51,502
Don't have any, Sir.

209
00:15:51,906 --> 00:15:53,980
Well, get him one, Kilgour!
Make yourself useful.

210
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,046
Yes, Sir.

211
00:15:58,539 --> 00:16:01,094
"Through this holy unction
may the Lord pardon thee

212
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:04,157
all faults or whatever sins
thou hast committed."

213
00:16:07,157 --> 00:16:11,320
I do hate losing these to the Hun.
So, when they start shooting at you,

214
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,338
could you be so kind as to
throw it back, there's a good chap.

215
00:16:18,142 --> 00:16:19,540
Cheerio.

216
00:16:26,894 --> 00:16:28,569
You sure?

217
00:16:29,463 --> 00:16:31,053
Yes.

218
00:16:36,902 --> 00:16:39,496
Age before beauty.

219
00:18:25,792 --> 00:18:27,714
You alright?

220
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:31,464
Look for cover.

221
00:18:52,957 --> 00:18:54,612
Sap trench.

222
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,813
Alright.

223
00:20:21,884 --> 00:20:23,600
Stay still.

224
00:20:31,913 --> 00:20:33,695
They're ours.

225
00:20:34,726 --> 00:20:37,269
Keep going. We're half-way.

226
00:21:41,543 --> 00:21:43,989
There's a gap in the wire.

227
00:22:41,726 --> 00:22:43,369
Sco...

228
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:09,309
There! That's the front line.

229
00:23:34,428 --> 00:23:38,284
Fuck me. They really have gone.

230
00:23:59,214 --> 00:24:01,030
Your hand alright?

231
00:24:02,017 --> 00:24:04,126
Put it through an effing German.

232
00:24:05,558 --> 00:24:07,030
Patch it up.

233
00:24:07,317 --> 00:24:09,573
You'll be wanking again
in no time.

234
00:24:10,595 --> 00:24:12,177
Wrong hand.

235
00:24:42,477 --> 00:24:44,483
They're not long gone.

236
00:25:07,457 --> 00:25:09,131
No good.

237
00:25:31,163 --> 00:25:32,792
Blocked.

238
00:25:33,137 --> 00:25:35,337
This might be a way through.

239
00:25:50,491 --> 00:25:52,027
Jesus...

240
00:26:00,081 --> 00:26:03,953
Look at this. It's massive.

241
00:26:07,168 --> 00:26:09,458
They built all this.

242
00:26:55,524 --> 00:26:57,233
Here's our way through.

243
00:26:57,384 --> 00:26:59,372
Sco.

244
00:27:00,306 --> 00:27:02,464
How about this?

245
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,848
Bloody hell!

246
00:27:10,536 --> 00:27:12,874
Even their rats
are bigger than ours.

247
00:27:19,666 --> 00:27:21,698
What do you think
is in the bags?

248
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,594
You cannot be that hungry.

249
00:27:30,438 --> 00:27:33,439
Look at him. Cocky little bastard.

250
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,085
You could eat this, though.

251
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:39,231
- What is it?
- Boche dog meat.

252
00:27:40,847 --> 00:27:42,731
What's in the other boxes?

253
00:27:44,685 --> 00:27:45,755
What's wrong?

254
00:27:45,855 --> 00:27:48,757
Trip wire. Don't move.

255
00:27:49,984 --> 00:27:51,804
Where is it?

256
00:27:53,764 --> 00:27:55,898
Goes from here to the door.

257
00:27:58,649 --> 00:27:59,607
Jesus!

258
00:27:59,607 --> 00:28:01,212
No! No!

259
00:28:11,196 --> 00:28:12,979
Sco?!

260
00:28:18,805 --> 00:28:20,074
Sco!

261
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:25,350
Sco!

262
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:29,912
Sco!

263
00:28:36,971 --> 00:28:38,665
Sco!

264
00:28:43,773 --> 00:28:47,533
Sco! Wake up! Wake up!

265
00:28:50,223 --> 00:28:52,082
Sco! Sco!

266
00:28:54,467 --> 00:28:58,838
Stand up! Stand up!
Come on! Stand up!

267
00:28:59,364 --> 00:29:01,590
Up! Up! Up!

268
00:29:02,396 --> 00:29:05,164
Come on! Stand up!

269
00:29:09,725 --> 00:29:13,077
The whole thing's coming down.
Come on.

270
00:29:17,718 --> 00:29:20,063
You keep hold of me!

271
00:29:32,888 --> 00:29:35,717
We need to keep moving. Come on!

272
00:29:36,121 --> 00:29:39,063
I can't see. I can't see!

273
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:41,464
Stop! Stop!

274
00:29:41,464 --> 00:29:44,370
Stop. It's a mineshaft.

275
00:29:45,052 --> 00:29:48,027
We will have to jump. Come on!

276
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,768
You're going to have to jump!
Just jump.

277
00:29:53,868 --> 00:29:55,014
I can't... I can't see!

278
00:29:55,014 --> 00:29:57,943
You need to trust me. Jump!

279
00:30:04,802 --> 00:30:07,436
Don't let go of me!
Don't let go!

280
00:30:10,754 --> 00:30:13,048
Light! There's light!

281
00:30:24,666 --> 00:30:26,441
Stop. Stop.

282
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:29,593
Just let me stand.

283
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,172
Dirty bastards!

284
00:30:40,331 --> 00:30:42,931
Careful, they may have left
other traps.

285
00:30:51,541 --> 00:30:53,360
Jesus.

286
00:31:03,657 --> 00:31:06,726
Dust. So much dust in my eyes.

287
00:31:15,661 --> 00:31:18,474
Here. Have some of mine.

288
00:31:24,994 --> 00:31:27,389
I wish I'd shot that rat now.

289
00:31:28,128 --> 00:31:30,662
And I wish you'd picked
some other bloody idiot.

290
00:31:30,669 --> 00:31:31,625
What?

291
00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:34,228
Why in God's name
did you have to choose me?

292
00:31:34,999 --> 00:31:36,493
I didn't know
what I was picking you for.

293
00:31:36,493 --> 00:31:38,222
No, you didn't.

294
00:31:38,222 --> 00:31:41,042
You never know.
That's your problem.

295
00:31:44,355 --> 00:31:47,671
Alright then, go back.
Nothing's stopping you.

296
00:31:47,671 --> 00:31:49,583
You can go all the way
bloody home if you want.

297
00:31:49,583 --> 00:31:52,380
Don't. Just don't.

298
00:31:53,857 --> 00:31:56,367
I didn't know
what I was picking you for.

299
00:31:56,718 --> 00:32:00,513
I thought they were going to send us back
up the line, or for food, or something.

300
00:32:01,103 --> 00:32:04,617
I thought it was going to be
something easy, alright?

301
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,469
I never thought it would be this.

302
00:32:15,023 --> 00:32:17,070
So, do you want to go back?

303
00:32:20,713 --> 00:32:22,934
Just fire the fucking flare.

304
00:32:37,965 --> 00:32:40,088
Up yours, Lieutenant.

305
00:32:55,365 --> 00:32:57,440
Do you know where we are?

306
00:32:59,827 --> 00:33:02,433
Ecoust is directly south-east.

307
00:33:03,636 --> 00:33:07,920
And if we keep that bearing,
we should make it.

308
00:33:11,661 --> 00:33:13,559
Come on then.

309
00:33:37,735 --> 00:33:41,418
Look at that.
They destroyed their own guns.

310
00:33:42,484 --> 00:33:44,930
They destroyed
their own trenches too.

311
00:33:45,892 --> 00:33:47,477
What do you mean?

312
00:33:47,688 --> 00:33:51,720
I think they wanted us to go that way.
They wanted to bury us.

313
00:33:59,652 --> 00:34:01,587
Bastard rats.

314
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,952
Hey, did you hear that story
about Wilko?

315
00:34:12,407 --> 00:34:13,547
How he lost his ear?

316
00:34:13,547 --> 00:34:16,623
I'm not in the mood.
Keep your eyes on the trees,

317
00:34:16,784 --> 00:34:18,418
top of the ridge.

318
00:34:21,472 --> 00:34:23,690
Bet he told you it was shrapnel.

319
00:34:25,276 --> 00:34:26,869
What was it then?

320
00:34:27,551 --> 00:34:31,185
Well, you know his girl's
a hairdresser, right?

321
00:34:31,731 --> 00:34:35,954
And he was moaning about the lack of
bathing facilities when he wrote to her -

322
00:34:36,384 --> 00:34:38,739
remember those rancid
Jakes at Arras?

323
00:34:39,373 --> 00:34:42,812
Anyway, she sends him over
this 'hair oil'.

324
00:34:43,966 --> 00:34:47,274
Smells sweet, like Golden Syrup.

325
00:34:49,246 --> 00:34:51,756
Wilko loves the smell,

326
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,923
but he doesn't want to
cart it around in his pack, so

327
00:34:56,666 --> 00:35:01,169
he slathers it all over his barnet,
goes to sleep,

328
00:35:01,442 --> 00:35:04,017
and in the middle of the night
he wakes up,

329
00:35:04,189 --> 00:35:09,868
and a rat is sitting on his shoulder
licking the oil off of his head.

330
00:35:10,486 --> 00:35:14,064
Wilko panics, and he jumps up,
and when he does -

331
00:35:14,064 --> 00:35:18,579
the rat bites clean through
his fucking ear and runs off with it!

332
00:35:18,777 --> 00:35:23,320
Oh, he made a hell of a fuss,
yelling, screaming.

333
00:35:23,578 --> 00:35:27,019
The best of it was he could put
so much bloody oil on himself

334
00:35:27,019 --> 00:35:30,584
that he couldn't wash it off!
He was like a magnet.

335
00:35:30,833 --> 00:35:33,517
Rats left us alone,
but they couldn't get enough of him.

336
00:35:33,517 --> 00:35:35,481
Poor bastard.

337
00:35:42,356 --> 00:35:46,298
Heading back home.
I wonder what they saw.

338
00:35:48,476 --> 00:35:50,240
Watch the ridge lines.

339
00:35:54,992 --> 00:35:57,367
Well, that's your medal
sorted then.

340
00:35:58,224 --> 00:35:59,665
What do you mean?

341
00:36:00,066 --> 00:36:02,378
"Lance Corporal Blake showed
unusual valour in rescuing

342
00:36:02,378 --> 00:36:06,118
a comrade from certain death"
blah, blah, blah.

343
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:09,172
You reckon?

344
00:36:09,591 --> 00:36:11,108
I do.

345
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:17,111
Well, that'd be nice.
Since you lost yours.

346
00:36:17,413 --> 00:36:19,044
I didn't lose mine.

347
00:36:20,254 --> 00:36:23,393
- What happened to it, then?
- Why do you care?

348
00:36:23,597 --> 00:36:25,351
Why do you not?

349
00:36:26,921 --> 00:36:29,040
I swapped it with a French captain.

350
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:32,173
You swapped it? For what?

351
00:36:32,835 --> 00:36:34,368
Bottle of wine.

352
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:38,396
- What did you do that for?
- I was thirsty.

353
00:36:40,336 --> 00:36:41,951
What a waste.

354
00:36:43,902 --> 00:36:46,545
You should've taken it home
with you, you should've

355
00:36:46,891 --> 00:36:48,896
given it to your family.

356
00:36:50,724 --> 00:36:52,489
Men have died for that.

357
00:36:54,154 --> 00:36:56,889
If I got a medal, I'd take it back home,
why didn't you just take it home...

358
00:36:56,889 --> 00:36:59,375
Look it's just a bit of bloody tin!

359
00:36:59,375 --> 00:37:03,177
It doesn't make you special,
it doesn't make any difference to anyone.

360
00:37:04,023 --> 00:37:05,710
Yes, it does.

361
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:09,483
And it's not just a bit of tin.
It's got a ribbon on it.

362
00:37:14,459 --> 00:37:18,383
I hated going home. I hated it.

363
00:37:20,288 --> 00:37:24,427
When I knew I couldn't stay.
When I knew I had to leave,

364
00:37:24,427 --> 00:37:26,894
and they might never see me.

365
00:37:56,955 --> 00:37:58,435
Jesus.

366
00:38:01,332 --> 00:38:03,335
They chopped them all down.

367
00:38:07,044 --> 00:38:08,864
Cherries.

368
00:38:12,302 --> 00:38:13,959
Lamberts.

369
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,946
They might be Dukes,
hard to tell when they aren't in fruit.

370
00:38:22,098 --> 00:38:23,898
What's the difference?

371
00:38:24,422 --> 00:38:28,482
People think there's one type,
but there's lots of them -

372
00:38:28,692 --> 00:38:33,129
Cuthberts, Queen Annes, Montmorencys.
Sweet ones, sour ones...

373
00:38:33,129 --> 00:38:35,371
Why on earth
would you know this?

374
00:38:35,576 --> 00:38:39,529
Mum's got an orchard, back home.
Only a few trees.

375
00:38:40,734 --> 00:38:45,186
This time of year it looks like
it's been snowing, blossom everywhere.

376
00:38:46,715 --> 00:38:51,744
And then in May, we have to pick them.
Me and Joe.

377
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:55,359
Takes the whole day.

378
00:38:56,011 --> 00:38:58,274
So, these ones all gonners?

379
00:38:58,446 --> 00:39:02,178
Oh no, they'll grow again
when the stones rot.

380
00:39:02,544 --> 00:39:04,863
You'll end up with more
trees than before.

381
00:39:10,284 --> 00:39:13,492
- It looks abandoned.
- Let's hope so.

382
00:39:14,221 --> 00:39:16,571
We have to make sure.

383
00:39:48,541 --> 00:39:51,017
I'll take front, you take back.

384
00:40:33,271 --> 00:40:34,862
Anything?

385
00:40:35,049 --> 00:40:36,849
Nothing.

386
00:40:55,211 --> 00:40:56,786
Did you find any food?

387
00:40:56,786 --> 00:41:00,874
No. I don't like this place.

388
00:42:08,963 --> 00:42:14,769
Map says we get over that ridge
and it's a straight shot to Ecoust.

389
00:42:16,177 --> 00:42:17,823
Good.

390
00:43:01,715 --> 00:43:03,714
Is that our friends again?

391
00:43:04,057 --> 00:43:07,479
Looks like it. Dogfight.

392
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:11,036
Who's winning?

393
00:43:11,221 --> 00:43:15,049
Us, I think. Two on one.

394
00:43:18,617 --> 00:43:20,591
They got him.

395
00:44:18,771 --> 00:44:20,313
We should put him out
of his misery.

396
00:44:20,313 --> 00:44:23,186
No. Get him some water.
He needs water.

397
00:44:24,094 --> 00:44:28,170
It's alright, you're alright.
Stay still. Stay still.

398
00:44:37,641 --> 00:44:39,866
Stop! Stop!

399
00:44:40,682 --> 00:44:42,562
No, no, no!

400
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:52,054
Bastard, bloody bastard.

401
00:44:57,237 --> 00:45:00,421
Oh, God no. Oh, God no!

402
00:45:02,076 --> 00:45:04,451
Jesus. Jesus, no.

403
00:45:05,205 --> 00:45:07,378
We have to stop the bleeding.

404
00:45:07,892 --> 00:45:09,060
Stop it. Stop it!

405
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:12,996
It's alright, it's going to be alright.
We're going to stand up.

406
00:45:13,653 --> 00:45:15,603
Yes. Yes.

407
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:21,913
No! I can't. I can't.

408
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:25,680
- We have to get to an Aid Post.
- I can't.

409
00:45:25,805 --> 00:45:28,806
- I'll carry you. It isn't very far.
- Just bring a doctor here.

410
00:45:28,938 --> 00:45:30,829
We can't, we have to go together.

411
00:45:32,394 --> 00:45:35,512
We're going to get up.
We're going to get up.

412
00:45:41,642 --> 00:45:44,369
Stop, please! Stop!

413
00:45:45,112 --> 00:45:49,717
Put me down! Put me down,
you bastard, please! Put me down!

414
00:46:00,407 --> 00:46:03,552
- You have to try to keep moving.
- Let's just sit.

415
00:46:03,748 --> 00:46:05,429
- Let me sit.
- No, we can't.

416
00:46:05,571 --> 00:46:07,364
We have to find
the 2nd, remember?

417
00:46:07,364 --> 00:46:09,077
Your brother.
We have to go now.

418
00:46:09,077 --> 00:46:11,291
You can start on without me.
I'll catch up.

419
00:46:11,739 --> 00:46:16,084
You can't stay here.
We have to move, alright?

420
00:46:16,161 --> 00:46:18,421
We have to move. Come on.

421
00:46:18,562 --> 00:46:19,904
Come on!

422
00:46:20,679 --> 00:46:24,287
Come on. That's it.
Come on, come on.

423
00:46:31,034 --> 00:46:34,308
Your brother.
We have to find your brother.

424
00:46:36,837 --> 00:46:38,677
You'll recognise him.

425
00:46:40,123 --> 00:46:44,273
He looks like me, he's a bit older.

426
00:46:57,159 --> 00:46:58,736
What are they?

427
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:03,021
Are we being shelled?

428
00:47:04,128 --> 00:47:06,882
They're embers.
The barn is on fire.

429
00:47:11,774 --> 00:47:13,472
I've been hit.

430
00:47:14,922 --> 00:47:16,679
What was it?

431
00:47:17,609 --> 00:47:19,498
You were stabbed.

432
00:47:24,859 --> 00:47:26,898
Am I dying?

433
00:47:35,314 --> 00:47:36,843
Yes.

434
00:47:38,034 --> 00:47:39,796
Yes. I think you are.

435
00:47:56,936 --> 00:47:59,758
- This?
- Inside.

436
00:48:23,448 --> 00:48:26,107
Will you write
to my mum for me?

437
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:28,999
I will.

438
00:48:31,314 --> 00:48:33,780
Tell her I wasn't scared.

439
00:48:37,155 --> 00:48:39,088
Anything else?

440
00:48:41,344 --> 00:48:43,367
I love them.

441
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:46,860
I wish that...

442
00:48:48,763 --> 00:48:50,624
I wish...

443
00:48:56,186 --> 00:48:58,175
Talk to me.

444
00:49:00,225 --> 00:49:02,324
Tell me you know the way.

445
00:49:05,672 --> 00:49:07,406
I know the way.

446
00:49:08,494 --> 00:49:11,841
I'm going to head south-east
until I hit Ecoust.

447
00:49:12,307 --> 00:49:15,070
I'll pass through the town
and out to the east,

448
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:17,451
all the way to Croisilles Wood.

449
00:49:17,737 --> 00:49:19,740
It'll be dark by then.

450
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:22,266
That won't bother me.

451
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:26,186
I'll find the 2nd,
I'll give them the message.

452
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:28,970
And then I'll find your brother.

453
00:49:29,326 --> 00:49:32,943
Just like you, a little older.

454
00:51:35,523 --> 00:51:37,192
You alright, mate?

455
00:51:38,713 --> 00:51:40,616
It's alright, it's okay.

456
00:51:41,105 --> 00:51:43,039
Come on, help him.

457
00:51:51,787 --> 00:51:54,785
Jesus, what happened to him?

458
00:51:56,128 --> 00:51:58,928
Was it the plane?
We saw the smoke.

459
00:51:59,012 --> 00:52:00,512
Yeah.

460
00:52:17,204 --> 00:52:19,141
Go fetch his things.

461
00:52:19,141 --> 00:52:21,089
- Sir.
- Sir.

462
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:26,141
A friend?

463
00:52:28,843 --> 00:52:30,944
What are you doing here?

464
00:52:31,023 --> 00:52:33,271
I have an urgent message
for the 2nd Devons.

465
00:52:33,526 --> 00:52:36,239
Orders to stop
tomorrow morning's attack.

466
00:52:36,422 --> 00:52:39,881
- And where are they stationed?
- Just beyond Ecoust.

467
00:52:40,544 --> 00:52:42,346
Come with me.

468
00:52:48,463 --> 00:52:50,572
Come with me, Corporal.
That's an order.

469
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:53,946
We're passing through Ecoust.
We can take you some of the way.

470
00:52:56,071 --> 00:52:57,718
Sir.

471
00:53:22,503 --> 00:53:25,962
Oh, come on Sergeant.
Put more men at the base.

472
00:53:26,573 --> 00:53:29,147
At the trunk!
It'll be heavier there.

473
00:53:29,749 --> 00:53:31,016
Might be a tight squeeze.

474
00:53:31,016 --> 00:53:33,444
You're not going to be able
to just lift it.

475
00:53:33,444 --> 00:53:35,792
Pivot the front end to the left.

476
00:53:35,877 --> 00:53:38,232
Jesus, they don't make
things easy, do they.

477
00:53:38,332 --> 00:53:41,906
They could at least have retreated
with a bit of grace. Bastards.

478
00:53:41,906 --> 00:53:43,228
Sir.

479
00:53:43,791 --> 00:53:45,690
- You're not one of mine.
- No, Sir.

480
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:48,595
He has an urgent message
to deliver to the 2nd Devons, Sir.

481
00:53:48,757 --> 00:53:50,479
- Can you get past it?
- No, Sir.

482
00:53:50,479 --> 00:53:53,270
Oh, for God's sake.
Just move it!

483
00:53:53,971 --> 00:53:56,318
There's room
in the casuals truck, sir.

484
00:53:56,685 --> 00:53:58,775
- He has orders.
- Yes, yes, alright.

485
00:53:58,775 --> 00:54:01,460
Come on now.
You can get through there sideways.

486
00:54:06,185 --> 00:54:07,919
How did you get here, Sir?

487
00:54:08,141 --> 00:54:11,436
Crossed No Man's Land
just outside Bapaume.

488
00:54:11,927 --> 00:54:13,554
Took us the whole night.

489
00:54:13,707 --> 00:54:17,702
Bumped into a couple of Hun stragglers on
the way who made a nuisance of themselves.

490
00:54:18,049 --> 00:54:21,311
- You going up to the new line?
- Attempting to.

491
00:54:21,492 --> 00:54:25,224
The Newfoundlands have pushed forwards
and requested reinforcements.

492
00:54:26,992 --> 00:54:28,781
I'm sorry about your friend.

493
00:54:30,154 --> 00:54:33,351
May I tell you something
that you probably already know?

494
00:54:34,968 --> 00:54:37,334
It doesn't do to dwell on it.

495
00:54:38,003 --> 00:54:39,645
No, Sir.

496
00:54:40,002 --> 00:54:41,486
Hop on.

497
00:54:43,246 --> 00:54:45,004
Make some space there.

498
00:54:46,859 --> 00:54:48,697
Come on, in you get!

499
00:55:05,004 --> 00:55:07,939
Alright. Here we go again boys.

500
00:55:10,323 --> 00:55:13,975
Welcome aboard the night bus
to a fuck-knows-where.

501
00:55:17,286 --> 00:55:18,945
Is that a dead dog?

502
00:55:20,571 --> 00:55:23,033
- You got a fag?
- Yeah, there you go.

503
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:40,561
- Butler.
- Oy.

504
00:55:40,661 --> 00:55:43,229
- Carry on with that story.
- Oh yeah, right.

505
00:55:43,329 --> 00:55:47,198
So, when we get off the train,
Beaufoy comes up to us,

506
00:55:47,589 --> 00:55:49,305
and he's having a right go:

507
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:53,409
"Lance Corporal! Whatever one does,
one never lets standards slip!"

508
00:55:53,509 --> 00:55:55,465
Then, Scott comes out of the latrine,

509
00:55:55,517 --> 00:55:57,831
he wipes his hand
on the back of Beaufoy's jacket!

510
00:55:58,046 --> 00:56:00,526
Shit all down his back.

511
00:56:00,670 --> 00:56:02,232
Was that meant to be Captain Beaufoy?

512
00:56:02,232 --> 00:56:04,634
Oh, piss off you.
You can't do any better.

513
00:56:04,998 --> 00:56:09,858
“Men! Your rifle stocks are an embarrassment
to the entire expeditionary force.”

514
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:12,687
You're both bloody awful.

515
00:56:12,687 --> 00:56:14,911
You don't know, you barely
even speak the bloody language.

516
00:56:15,011 --> 00:56:16,875
He's got a better grasp of it
than you, Cooke.

517
00:56:16,875 --> 00:56:18,971
Go on then Jondalar,
give it a go, let's see it!

518
00:56:19,351 --> 00:56:21,049
Let's hear it then Jonny!

519
00:56:21,448 --> 00:56:25,762
"Rossi! Never in my 200 years
as a soldier have I seen

520
00:56:25,762 --> 00:56:28,478
such a sorry excuse
for a latrine pit."

521
00:56:28,576 --> 00:56:31,310
Shite. That is total shit.

522
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,803
Oy! You could've taken
my teeth out with that.

523
00:56:33,803 --> 00:56:36,085
You could do with a new set.

524
00:56:40,817 --> 00:56:43,147
You got somewhere you need to be?

525
00:56:45,965 --> 00:56:48,775
Arsehole needs driving lessons.

526
00:57:03,298 --> 00:57:05,608
- He should reverse.
- Yeah.

527
00:57:06,547 --> 00:57:09,770
Try it in reverse. Reverse!

528
00:57:17,511 --> 00:57:19,880
No. Stop. Stop!

529
00:57:20,208 --> 00:57:22,389
Everyone needs to get out.

530
00:57:22,728 --> 00:57:26,144
All out! Come on!

531
00:57:26,144 --> 00:57:29,623
Alright, alright.
Keep your bloody hair on.

532
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:34,517
Right. One. Two. Three.

533
00:57:41,012 --> 00:57:43,154
We need to get some wood,
put it under the wheels.

534
00:57:43,154 --> 00:57:46,684
No! We haven't got the time!
We all need to push. Come on.

535
00:57:46,684 --> 00:57:48,559
Come on!

536
00:57:48,897 --> 00:57:50,847
Come oooon!

537
00:57:54,474 --> 00:57:58,085
Please. I have to go now. Please.

538
00:57:59,773 --> 00:58:03,272
- Alright, come on lads. Come on!
- Come on, boys.

539
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:06,840
One. Two. Three!

540
00:58:17,495 --> 00:58:22,539
Come on boys! One last push! Yes!
One. Two. Three!

541
00:58:34,809 --> 00:58:38,691
Back in. Get back in. Go.

542
00:58:39,868 --> 00:58:41,568
Are you alright?

543
00:58:42,028 --> 00:58:45,783
Here, Driver, how about you try
to keep it on the bloody road for a change!

544
00:58:45,783 --> 00:58:47,253
Oh, piss off.

545
00:59:06,134 --> 00:59:08,271
So, where are you going?

546
00:59:09,179 --> 00:59:12,538
I have to get to the 2nd Devons.
Just past Ecoust.

547
00:59:12,941 --> 00:59:14,242
Why?

548
00:59:15,072 --> 00:59:18,469
They're attacking at dawn.
I have orders to stop them.

549
00:59:18,469 --> 00:59:19,910
How come?

550
00:59:21,109 --> 00:59:22,916
They're walking into a trap.

551
00:59:22,916 --> 00:59:24,361
How many?

552
00:59:24,845 --> 00:59:26,816
1600.

553
00:59:28,509 --> 00:59:30,182
Jesus.

554
00:59:31,922 --> 00:59:34,125
Why did they send you
on your own?

555
00:59:35,183 --> 00:59:38,496
They didn't. There were two of us.

556
00:59:39,351 --> 00:59:41,350
So, now it's down to you.

557
00:59:41,696 --> 00:59:43,239
Yes.

558
00:59:44,106 --> 00:59:45,927
You'll never make it.

559
00:59:49,892 --> 00:59:51,804
Yes. I will.

560
00:59:57,858 --> 00:59:59,281
Thank you.

561
01:00:01,765 --> 01:00:05,191
Look at it. Fucking look at it.

562
01:00:06,422 --> 01:00:08,561
Three years fighting over this.

563
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:11,548
We should have just let
the bastards keep it.

564
01:00:12,174 --> 01:00:13,928
I mean, who machine guns, cows?

565
01:00:14,028 --> 01:00:17,629
- Huns with extra bullets.
- Bastards.

566
01:00:18,914 --> 01:00:24,426
Clever. They know if they don't shoot
the cow, you will eat it.

567
01:00:24,855 --> 01:00:26,314
Still, bastards.

568
01:00:26,314 --> 01:00:28,854
Yeah, it's not even our
bloody country.

569
01:00:28,987 --> 01:00:30,700
How long gone
d'you reckon they are?

570
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:33,815
Why? Worried we'll
catch up with them?

571
01:00:34,334 --> 01:00:37,295
Yeah, right.
Be a bloody miracle at this rate.

572
01:00:37,469 --> 01:00:39,587
They are probably
right around the next corner.

573
01:00:39,830 --> 01:00:41,687
Piss off, no they're not.

574
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,697
Why don't they
just bloody well give up?

575
01:00:46,634 --> 01:00:47,876
Don't they want to go home?

576
01:00:47,876 --> 01:00:52,199
They hate their wives and mothers...
and Germany must be a shit hole.

577
01:00:54,117 --> 01:00:59,360
They're retreating... they're miles back.
We've got them on the ropes at least.

578
01:01:00,196 --> 01:01:02,906
No. We don't.

579
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:09,005
- Oh, bollocks. What's up now?
- Not another bloody tree.

580
01:01:09,137 --> 01:01:12,684
- Bridge is down.
- Oh. That's a shame.

581
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:15,838
Looks like I'll be getting out here.
Good luck.

582
01:01:16,645 --> 01:01:19,657
Keep some of that luck for yourself pal.
Think you'll be needing it.

583
01:01:19,657 --> 01:01:21,318
- Good luck, mate.
- Good luck, guv.

584
01:01:21,318 --> 01:01:23,365
- Good luck.
- Don't balls it up.

585
01:01:23,830 --> 01:01:25,718
I hope you get there.

586
01:01:26,754 --> 01:01:28,166
Thank you.

587
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:34,625
The next bridge is six miles.
We'll have to divert.

588
01:01:34,959 --> 01:01:38,032
I can't, Sir.
I don't have the time.

589
01:01:38,257 --> 01:01:39,976
Of course.

590
01:01:41,456 --> 01:01:43,041
Best of luck.

591
01:01:43,544 --> 01:01:45,096
Thank you, Sir.

592
01:01:48,333 --> 01:01:49,823
Corporal.

593
01:01:50,593 --> 01:01:53,208
If you do manage to get
to Colonel MacKenzie,

594
01:01:54,408 --> 01:01:56,701
make sure there are witnesses.

595
01:01:57,312 --> 01:01:58,554
They are direct orders, Sir.

596
01:01:58,554 --> 01:02:00,133
I know.

597
01:02:01,070 --> 01:02:03,518
But some men
just want the fight.

598
01:02:05,774 --> 01:02:07,257
Thank you, Sir.

599
01:02:11,647 --> 01:02:14,746
Driver! Move off!

600
01:12:52,513 --> 01:12:55,963
Anglais. Not German.

601
01:12:56,673 --> 01:12:59,971
Friend... I'm a friend.

602
01:13:02,969 --> 01:13:06,998
This place, this town. Ecoust?

603
01:13:08,152 --> 01:13:09,930
<i>C'est Ecoust?</i>

604
01:13:17,068 --> 01:13:21,004
Others? No. Just me.

605
01:13:23,253 --> 01:13:25,458
Only. Me.

606
01:13:27,772 --> 01:13:29,683
I need to be somewhere.

607
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:34,056
I need to find a wood
to the South East.

608
01:13:36,173 --> 01:13:38,870
Trees... <i>Les arbres</i>?

609
01:13:41,767 --> 01:13:43,931
<i>- Croiset?
- Croisilles?</i>

610
01:13:44,393 --> 01:13:46,195
Yes.

611
01:13:49,616 --> 01:13:50,980
River?

612
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:57,313
River. It go there.
Trees. Croisilles.

613
01:15:29,941 --> 01:15:31,610
Thank you.

614
01:15:59,104 --> 01:16:00,911
A girl?

615
01:16:18,452 --> 01:16:20,454
What is her name?

616
01:16:24,524 --> 01:16:26,712
Who is her mother?

617
01:16:35,009 --> 01:16:38,793
I have food. Here.

618
01:16:42,591 --> 01:16:44,131
I have these.

619
01:16:45,385 --> 01:16:48,127
You can have them - here,
take them all,

620
01:16:48,442 --> 01:16:51,090
for you and the child. Here.

621
01:17:01,652 --> 01:17:03,313
Milk?

622
01:17:23,323 --> 01:17:25,186
Merci.

623
01:17:32,848 --> 01:17:34,648
Bonjour.

624
01:17:36,169 --> 01:17:38,075
Bonjour.

625
01:17:41,687 --> 01:17:44,274
Children, you?

626
01:17:47,114 --> 01:17:48,731
It's alright.

627
01:18:03,205 --> 01:18:05,975
"They went to sea
in a Sieve, they did,"

628
01:18:06,698 --> 01:18:09,324
In a Sieve they went to sea:

629
01:18:10,244 --> 01:18:13,396
In spite of all
their friends could say,

630
01:18:13,622 --> 01:18:16,887
On a winter's morn,
on a stormy day,

631
01:18:17,297 --> 01:18:19,873
"In a Sieve they went to sea!"

632
01:18:20,690 --> 01:18:23,691
"Far and few, far and few,"

633
01:18:23,691 --> 01:18:26,728
Are the lands
where the Jumblies live;

634
01:18:27,798 --> 01:18:31,829
Their heads are green,
and their hands are blue,

635
01:18:33,974 --> 01:18:36,872
"And they went to sea
in a Sieve."

636
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:26,897
Stay. Stay. Please.

637
01:19:27,099 --> 01:19:28,847
I have to go.

638
01:19:38,137 --> 01:19:40,765
- Please.
- I'm sorry.

639
01:21:12,004 --> 01:21:13,724
Engländer!

640
01:21:49,898 --> 01:21:51,566
Baumer?

641
01:21:54,940 --> 01:21:56,592
Baumer?

642
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:12,932

You alright, pal?

669
01:32:29,972 --> 01:32:31,201
Where are you from?

670
01:32:31,301 --> 01:32:33,529
- He's probably got the wind up.
- Well, he's not one of ours.

671
01:32:33,529 --> 01:32:35,362
He's bloody soaked.

672
01:32:35,582 --> 01:32:38,258
Fuck it, let's just pick him up
and take him with us.

673
01:32:38,258 --> 01:32:40,110
Have to find the Devons.

674
01:32:40,934 --> 01:32:43,380
- What's he saying?
- What's that mate?

675
01:32:43,794 --> 01:32:48,147
The Devons.
I have to find the Devons.

676
01:32:49,337 --> 01:32:51,278
We're the Devons.

677
01:32:54,755 --> 01:32:57,359
- You're the Devons?
- Yes, Corp.

678
01:32:59,054 --> 01:33:00,924
Why haven't you gone over?

679
01:33:00,924 --> 01:33:03,909
- We're the second wave.
- They don't send us all at once.

680
01:33:03,909 --> 01:33:06,923
Yeah, we're D Company,
we spent the night digging in.

681
01:33:07,049 --> 01:33:08,902
We go last.

682
01:33:10,485 --> 01:33:11,788
Are you alright?

683
01:33:11,912 --> 01:33:14,600
MacKenzie. Where's Colonel MacKenzie?

684
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:16,462
He's down at the line.

685
01:33:16,695 --> 01:33:18,034
- Which way?
- This way.

686
01:33:18,034 --> 01:33:19,776
We're headed up there now.

687
01:33:20,308 --> 01:33:22,646
Oy! Steady on mate!
Where you going?

688
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:45,158
Move!

689
01:33:48,764 --> 01:33:50,346
Let me by!

690
01:33:54,499 --> 01:33:56,011
Let me through!

691
01:34:02,747 --> 01:34:04,419
Where's your commanding officer?

692
01:34:04,419 --> 01:34:06,572
He's in the holding pen.

693
01:34:12,443 --> 01:34:15,468
B Company, stand to!
Now listen, and listen well!

694
01:34:15,568 --> 01:34:19,765
On the first mark, A Company will advance!
B Company will then move to the front line!

695
01:34:19,765 --> 01:34:22,302
Sir, I have a message
from General Erinmore!

696
01:34:22,302 --> 01:34:23,030
Who the fuck are you?

697
01:34:23,030 --> 01:34:26,515
The attack has been called off.
General Erinmore has called off the attack.

698
01:34:26,515 --> 01:34:29,553
Balls, man. We're about to go over.
We've got them on the run.

699
01:34:29,553 --> 01:34:31,463
You don't! Please.
Don't send your men over.

700
01:34:31,463 --> 01:34:32,381
Get out of the way, Corporal!

701
01:34:32,481 --> 01:34:35,579
These are direct orders from Army command!
Where is the Colonel MacKenzie?

702
01:34:35,679 --> 01:34:38,337
Jesus Christ, man!
Go and see the Captain!

703
01:34:38,523 --> 01:34:42,193
Now I want us up there quickly,
you understand? Do you understand!

704
01:34:42,193 --> 01:34:43,567
Yes, Sir!

705
01:34:57,316 --> 01:34:59,982
Sections 9 and 10 at the ready!

706
01:35:00,582 --> 01:35:04,236
We will advance
on the first whistle blast!

707
01:35:04,281 --> 01:35:08,623
You must not slow down!
If the man next to you falls, keep moving!

708
01:35:08,623 --> 01:35:10,479
Your orders are to break the lines.

709
01:35:10,716 --> 01:35:13,442
- Where is the Captain?
- He's over there.

710
01:35:15,463 --> 01:35:17,428
Sir? Sir!

711
01:35:18,947 --> 01:35:22,822
Captain, I have a message.
This attack is called off.

712
01:35:22,822 --> 01:35:25,451
You have to stop,
you have to stop.

713
01:35:29,023 --> 01:35:32,964
Where is Colonel MacKenzie?
Where is MacKenzie?!

714
01:36:00,505 --> 01:36:05,452
Get back! Return to your sectors.
Get back! Back! Hold fast!

715
01:36:05,605 --> 01:36:07,658
7 Platoon! One Minute!

716
01:36:07,758 --> 01:36:10,904
Sir, I have orders
to stop this attack.

717
01:36:11,112 --> 01:36:14,095
- What?
- Where is Colonel MacKenzie?

718
01:36:14,443 --> 01:36:15,982
He's further up the line.

719
01:36:16,420 --> 01:36:17,259
How far?

720
01:36:17,259 --> 01:36:19,692
300 yards.
He's in a cut and cover.

721
01:36:19,832 --> 01:36:22,375
You'll have to wait
until the first wave goes over.

722
01:36:22,668 --> 01:36:25,117
No! No, I can't!

723
01:36:32,328 --> 01:36:35,882
7 Platoon! 30 seconds!

724
01:36:47,866 --> 01:36:51,049
You can't possibly make it
that way man, are you bloody insane?

725
01:36:55,551 --> 01:36:57,952
What the hell are you doing,
Lance Corporal?

726
01:36:58,087 --> 01:37:00,348
No! No!

727
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:08,758
- Colonel MacKenzie?
- He's in there.

728
01:38:09,918 --> 01:38:11,683
B Company two minutes!

729
01:38:11,683 --> 01:38:13,227
Let me through!

730
01:38:14,475 --> 01:38:15,231
Let me through!

731
01:38:15,231 --> 01:38:17,446
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

732
01:38:17,646 --> 01:38:19,111
I have to see Colonel MacKenzie!

733
01:38:19,111 --> 01:38:20,984
- What are you doing?!
- I have to stop this attack.

734
01:38:20,984 --> 01:38:22,921
Colonel, we've seen flares,
the men on the left flank

735
01:38:22,921 --> 01:38:24,097
have made it
to the German Line.

736
01:38:24,097 --> 01:38:25,075
- Colonel!
- Hold him!

737
01:38:25,075 --> 01:38:26,699
Colonel!

738
01:38:26,699 --> 01:38:28,789
Listen to me, listen to me!
I have a letter!

739
01:38:28,789 --> 01:38:30,534
I need to see Colonel MacKenzie!

740
01:38:30,534 --> 01:38:32,249
There's no bloody way
you're getting in there, mate!

741
01:38:32,249 --> 01:38:34,837
- Sergeant! Send the next wave!
- No!

742
01:38:37,386 --> 01:38:39,081
Colonel MacKenzie!

743
01:38:39,314 --> 01:38:43,248
This attack is not to go ahead!
You've been ordered to stop.

744
01:38:43,494 --> 01:38:45,991
- You have to stop.
- Who the hell are you?

745
01:38:46,222 --> 01:38:48,495
Lance Corporal Schofield, Sir. 8th.

746
01:38:48,633 --> 01:38:51,549
I have orders from General Erinmore
to call off this attack.

747
01:38:51,649 --> 01:38:53,063
You're too late, Lance Corporal.

748
01:38:53,063 --> 01:38:56,518
Sir, these orders are from Army Command.
You have to read them.

749
01:38:56,618 --> 01:38:58,108
Shall we hold back
the second wave, Sir?

750
01:38:58,108 --> 01:39:01,158
No, Major. Hesitate now and we lose.
Victory is only 500 yards away.

751
01:39:01,258 --> 01:39:05,949
- Sir! Please read the letter.
- I have heard it all before.

752
01:39:06,334 --> 01:39:08,455
I'm not going to wait
until dusk, or for fog.

753
01:39:08,455 --> 01:39:11,310
I'm not calling back my men,
only to send them out there again tomorrow.

754
01:39:11,310 --> 01:39:14,124
Not when we've got the bastards on the run.
This is their last stand.

755
01:39:14,124 --> 01:39:16,134
The German's planned this, Sir.

756
01:39:16,980 --> 01:39:20,565
They've been planning it for months.
They want you to attack.

757
01:39:21,518 --> 01:39:23,500
Read the letter.

758
01:39:43,541 --> 01:39:45,326
- Major.
- Yes, Sir.

759
01:39:47,850 --> 01:39:50,500
- Stand them down.
- Yes, Sir.

760
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:52,615
Call up the orderlies.
Tend the wounded.

761
01:39:52,782 --> 01:39:55,120
- Hold the line in case they counter.
- Yes, Sir.

762
01:39:55,969 --> 01:39:58,817
Stand down! Stand down!

763
01:40:12,086 --> 01:40:14,706
I hoped today might be a good day.

764
01:40:16,819 --> 01:40:19,471
Hope is a dangerous thing.

765
01:40:21,300 --> 01:40:24,772
That's it for now, then next week,
Command will send a different message.

766
01:40:25,476 --> 01:40:27,345
Attack at dawn.

767
01:40:30,680 --> 01:40:33,091
There is only one way
this war ends.

768
01:40:35,311 --> 01:40:37,670
Last man standing.

769
01:40:42,746 --> 01:40:44,799
Have someone see to your wounds.

770
01:40:47,335 --> 01:40:50,345
Now fuck off, Lance Corporal.

771
01:41:03,586 --> 01:41:05,486
Well done, lad.

772
01:41:06,172 --> 01:41:07,717
Thank you, Sir.

773
01:41:09,636 --> 01:41:11,778
Do you know where
Lieutenant Blake is, Sir?

774
01:41:12,036 --> 01:41:13,675
Blake?

775
01:41:13,809 --> 01:41:17,714
There were two of us.
I was sent here with his brother.

776
01:41:20,252 --> 01:41:23,788
Well, knowing Lieutenant Blake
he would've gone over with his men.

777
01:41:23,788 --> 01:41:25,896
He was in the first wave.

778
01:41:27,056 --> 01:41:28,912
How could I find him, Sir?

779
01:41:28,912 --> 01:41:32,453
You can try the casualty clearing station,
behind the line.

780
01:41:33,886 --> 01:41:35,470
Otherwise...

781
01:41:38,503 --> 01:41:40,410
Thank you, Sir.

782
01:43:01,401 --> 01:43:04,856
Sergeant, I have to find Lieutenant Blake.
Do you know where he is?

783
01:43:04,856 --> 01:43:06,373
No.

784
01:43:27,766 --> 01:43:31,213
- Sir, is Lieutenant Blake here?
- No idea.

785
01:43:32,607 --> 01:43:34,223
Move along Corporal.

786
01:43:35,283 --> 01:43:38,104
If you can walk,
move to the triage area.

787
01:43:45,394 --> 01:43:47,352
Lieutenant Blake!

788
01:43:58,916 --> 01:44:00,459
Blake?!

789
01:44:02,728 --> 01:44:05,418
Has anyone seen Lieutenant Blake?

790
01:44:55,370 --> 01:44:58,687
Now come on boys.
He's taken one in the leg.

791
01:44:59,082 --> 01:45:00,858
He's lost a lot of blood.

792
01:45:01,230 --> 01:45:03,550
- Lieutenant Blake?
- Yes.

793
01:45:05,147 --> 01:45:06,993
Do you need medical assistance?

794
01:45:08,391 --> 01:45:11,320
No, Sir. I'm from the 8th.

795
01:45:11,589 --> 01:45:13,563
What the hell
are you doing here?

796
01:45:14,412 --> 01:45:15,815
I was sent here
to deliver a message.

797
01:45:15,815 --> 01:45:18,671
The 8th?
You must know my brother.

798
01:45:19,891 --> 01:45:23,190
- I was sent here with him.
- Tom's here? Where is he?

799
01:45:29,589 --> 01:45:34,352
It was very quick. I'm sorry.

800
01:45:58,802 --> 01:46:00,432
What's your name?

801
01:46:01,127 --> 01:46:03,193
Schofield, Sir.

802
01:46:05,758 --> 01:46:07,505
I'm sorry, what?

803
01:46:07,868 --> 01:46:12,829
It's Schofield, Sir.
William Schofield. Will.

804
01:46:15,761 --> 01:46:19,358
Well, you need some food.
Get yourself to the mess tent.

805
01:46:33,928 --> 01:46:38,095
If I may, I'd like to write
to your mother.

806
01:46:38,668 --> 01:46:41,042
Tell her that Tom wasn't alone.

807
01:46:44,303 --> 01:46:45,803
Of course.

808
01:46:48,066 --> 01:46:49,618
He was...

809
01:46:51,073 --> 01:46:53,037
He was a good man.

810
01:46:54,558 --> 01:46:57,095
Always telling funny stories.

811
01:46:59,429 --> 01:47:01,623
He saved my life.

812
01:47:04,910 --> 01:47:07,180
Well, I am glad
you were with him.

813
01:47:13,150 --> 01:47:14,772
Thank you, Will.

814
