1
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,620
Thank you.

2
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,060
Someone better call the Police.

3
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,420
I wish they all could be
California girls...

4
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,780
- The Beach Boys are dope.
- I love Beach Boys.

5
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,940
Hey, ladies, how you doin'?
Wait a minute.

6
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,300
Where you goin'?
Let's get some sushi!

7
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,060
Hey! Hey, cutie!

8
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,540
I wish they all could...

9
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,380
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
That was my CD!

10
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,060
Don't you ever touch
a Chinese man's CD.

11
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,740
You see the way those girls drove off?
They was laughing at us.

12
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,460
Those girls drove off
because of you.

13
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,340
All I did was invite them
to have a drink.

14
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,500
You invited them to get naked...

15
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,820
and sacrifice a small goat.

16
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,220
Which word was "goat"?

17
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,740
You owe me a copy of
The Beach Boys' Greatest Hits.

18
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,540
Don't get no attitude with me, Lee.
I've worked your cases for three days.

19
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,220
Reason I'm here in Hong Kong is 'cause
you said you'd show me a good time.

20
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,940
I'm on vacation, man,
and I want some mu shu.

21
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,020
- Mu shu? You hungry?
- No, Lee, not mu shu.

22
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,900
Some mu shu.
I wanna see some women, man.

23
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,140
Now stop playin' dumb
and show me to the shu.

24
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,300
There was a bombing at the
U.S. Embassy.

25
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,180
Two American translators
were killed.

26
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,700
Any leads?

27
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,660
We think it's Ricky Tan.

28
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,260
His entire gang of Triads
is at the club tonight.

29
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,620
If you don't want to take
the case, I'll understand.

30
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,380
No, it's OK.

31
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,180
What was that?

32
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,500
Did you just take another
damn case on my vacation, man?

33
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,940
Of course not. My superintendent
invited us to a club.

34
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,140
- Big party tonight.
- Don't be messin' with me, Lee.

35
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,900
I will slap you so hard,
you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.

36
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,580
I mean it. I'll bitch-slap you
back to Bangkok.

37
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,140
- Big party?
- Big one.

38
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,540
OK, well,
let's go party then.

39
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,700
Hey, this is nice.
Hey, cutie.

40
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,340
They don't like tourists in here,
so try to blend in.

41
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,620
What do you mean, blend in?
I'm two feet taller than everybody here.

42
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,020
- Wait here.
- Where you goin'?

43
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:44,580
- Bathroom.
- Hurry back, 'cause we gonna party.

44
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,700
How you doin'?

45
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:03,300
Come here a lot?
It's a nice place.

46
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,660
Take us through the hours

47
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,100
I won't make you, baby

48
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,740
What in the world
is goin' on up in here?

49
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,420
Am I the only one
listenin' to this?

50
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,420
The man destroyin' a classic!

51
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,380
With the force, don't stop
Don't stop till you get enough

52
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,700
Keep on with the force
Don't stop

53
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,100
- Don't stop till you get enough
- Boo!

54
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:29,020
With the force, don't stop
Don't stop till you get enough

55
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,660
I can't take
no more of this, man.

56
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,900
Get closer
Oh, get closer

57
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,180
I'm burnin'now

58
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,900
Just love me

59
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,860
Till you

60
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,940
Don't know how

61
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,500
Keep on till
the force starts up

62
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,500
Don't stop till you get enough
Keep on

63
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,980
Till the force starts up
Ah, don't stop till you get enough

64
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,980
Keep on
till the force starts up

65
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,060
Come on, girls!

66
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,380
Come on
till the force starts up

67
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,700
Ah, don't stop
till you get enough

68
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,500
Come on! Come on!

69
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,100
Come here, girls
Don't stop till you...

70
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,660
Come on, girls
I can't believe it

71
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,820
Come on, don't stop.
You know you feel the force!

72
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,300
Don't stop till you get enough

73
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,620
- I feel the force!
- Carter!

74
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,740
Come on! Come on!

75
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,620
- Carter!
- Come on, Lee!

76
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,340
- Carter!
- Come on!

77
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,700
I'll be right back
I'll be right back

78
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,660
I'll be right back

79
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,060
Lee, these people love me.
Come on out here.

80
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,140
- Get off the stage.
- Are you crazy, man?

81
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,020
I'm a star, a god to these people.
Check this out.

82
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,260
This is a gangster bar.
We are here undercover.

83
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,020
I knew you was lyin'.
I knew you was lyin', man.

84
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,100
- I'm sorry, Carter.
- You a liar!

85
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,100
We are here to find Ricky Tan.
We must tread softly.

86
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,180
Tread softly?
What in the world you talkin' about?

87
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,820
Who taught you how to roust a bar?
"Tread softly."

88
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:41,420
These men are Triads,
the most deadly gang in China.

89
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,020
You think that scare me? I'm from
Los Angeles. We invented gangs.

90
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,100
- Give me that badge.
- No! You are civilian!

91
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,140
In Hong Kong, I am Michael Jackson!
You are Toto!

92
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,100
You mean Tito! Toto is what
we ate last night for dinner.

93
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,020
- Now give me that badge.
- No!

94
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,580
Listen up!

95
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,220
Right now!

96
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,660
What did I just say?

97
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:24,460
You just asked everybody
to pick up their samurai swords...

98
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,860
and shave your butt.

99
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,140
- I said that?
- Yes.

100
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,540
Come out here and translate
this for me. Come on.

101
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,460
All right, listen up!

102
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,220
All the Triads
and the ugly women on this side...

103
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:41,340
and all the fine women
on this side right now!

104
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,780
Translate it.

105
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:46,220
He wants the men on the right.
And the women on the left.

106
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,340
Y'all gonna act like
y'all don't hear what I'm sayin'.

107
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:54,500
Who in here know Ricky Tan?
Raise your hand.

108
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,820
Translate.

109
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,620
I apologize. My friend is very drunk.

110
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,540
I see what's goin' on here. OK.

111
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,500
I ain't got time
to be playin' no games now.

112
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,340
Hu Li!

113
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,620
Hey, Lee!

114
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,180
Out of the way!
L.A.P.D.!

115
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,980
Lee! Hold up!

116
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,580
Hell no.

117
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:10,140
Lee, I'm takin' the stairs!

118
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,820
Move aside, Kobe.

119
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:58,900
Sorry.

120
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,780
Sorry for interrupting your meal, sir.

121
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,860
Carter!

122
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,380
Over here!

123
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,060
- Lee!
- Help me!

124
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,980
- How you get down there?
- Hurry up!

125
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,100
Hold on!
Don't let go, man.

126
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,220
- Here.
- Watch out behind you!

127
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,940
- Behind you!
- What?

128
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,460
Who the hell was that?

129
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,740
Lord Jesus,
I don't wanna die!

130
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,940
Lee, help me, man!

131
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:28,460
Don't worry.
Chinese bamboo is very strong.

132
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,020
- You sure, man?
- I'm sure.

133
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,300
Let go! Let go!

134
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,780
I can't believe I flew
10,000 miles for this shit!

135
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,300
I can't believe
you lied to me, man.

136
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,700
- I'm sorry.
- You sorry?

137
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,820
I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck up
my ass, and all you say is you sorry?

138
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,940
- There was an explosion.
- I don't give a damn!

139
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,220
At the American embassy.
Two Americans were killed.

140
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,020
So you think this guy Ricky Tan
blew up the embassy?

141
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:27,260
- I don't know.
- Then why the hell you lookin' for him?

142
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,140
- We're gonna find out.
- No, you gonna find out.

143
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:33,300
There's two billion Chinese people here.
Let one of them be your partner.

144
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,860
Where the hell we at now?

145
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,820
Massage parlor.
Heaven on Earth.

146
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,340
This is more like it.

147
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:48,100
I'm about to go in here and get
a massage and a hot tea bath right now.

148
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,100
Just follow my lead.
Act like a tourist.

149
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,020
I am a tourist, fool.

150
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:58,340
Slow down, Chen!
Hell is wrong with you?

151
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:11,420
My American friend is on vacation.
I want to show him a good time.

152
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,180
Oh, you American.

153
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,780
- Yeah.
- You bring American money?

154
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,900
- I got it, Lee.
- You sure?

155
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,740
I'm sure.

156
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,980
Thank you.

157
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,980
- You're welcome.
- Right this way.

158
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,780
Are you ready?

159
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,860
You ready? I'm ready.

160
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:44,620
Oh, my goodness!

161
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,580
This place is off the hook!
I love Hong Kong.

162
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,820
You get massage
from Chinese girl before?

163
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:52,060
No, but I heard
it was the bomb.

164
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,140
Come with me.

165
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,540
You pick any girl
for you and your friend.

166
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,500
- Any girl?
- Any girl.

167
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,460
I don't know where to start.

168
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:09,900
- I'll take that one. She got to come.
- Yes, she's very nice.

169
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:13,620
She is nice, but I hurt my back and my
neck, and I need a little more massage.

170
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,860
So I'm gonna take her
in the pink too.

171
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,300
- Oh, yes.
- And let me get her.

172
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,940
And let me have her.
Can I get her too?

173
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,060
And her right there.
She good with feet?

174
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,220
- Oh, yes.
- What are you doing?

175
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:29,060
- She said I could have any girl I want.
- Well, hurry up!

176
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:32,580
What's wrong with you? Don't jump in
front of a black man in a buffet line.

177
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,020
Calm down!

178
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,740
Your friend has big appetite.

179
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:41,140
Please, follow her upstairs
into the quiet room.

180
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,500
It ain't gonna be
no quiet room no more.

181
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,220
Y'all don't know
how good this feels.

182
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,660
I got in a big fight last night
with the Triads.

183
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:56,340
Y'all ever heard of the Triads?
I beat down like 20 of 'em.

184
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,420
Y'all should've seen me.
It was on.

185
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:04,580
This is what I'm talkin' about, man.
Now I'm on vacation.

186
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,900
I knew you'd come through.
I just knew it.

187
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,500
America?

188
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:13,620
Wanna come to America with me?
Ever been to America?

189
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,060
How's your girl?

190
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,580
- Lee, what's wrong?
- That's Ricky Tan.

191
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,900
That's Ricky Tan?
That's a midget in a bathrobe!

192
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,940
I will call for backup.

193
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,060
He's four feet tall.
Let's bust him now.

194
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:30,460
- He's a very dangerous man.
- I'm a very dangerous man.

195
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,540
Look, let's go over there
and bust him.

196
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,780
You're not about to mess up
my massage, I'm telling you.

197
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:35,900
Stay here.

198
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,860
You don't need backup.
I got your back...

199
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,980
Excuse me for a minute.
Just for a minute.

200
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,140
I'll be back. Don't...

201
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,100
I'll be back.

202
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,340
Ricky? Ricky Tan?

203
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,580
Get up, dog. I've been
lookin' for you everywhere.

204
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,940
I'm busy at the moment.

205
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,980
You hear what I said? I'm busy too.
Now get on your feet.

206
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,340
- Get on your feet!
- I know you.

207
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,580
You are Lee's
American friend, right?

208
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,380
I'm Lee's new muscle.
Don't let this robe fool you.

209
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,260
This is the only color they had.
Now I said, get up.

210
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,180
I ain't gonna say it again.

211
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,940
You American are so funny.

212
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,220
And you Asians
don't hear that well.

213
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,740
Little Ricky!

214
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:28,100
Get your little punk ass up...

215
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,420
outta that chair right now!

216
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:35,380
You're messin' up my vacation.
I told you to get up, didn't I?

217
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,100
Now I gotta go off on you.

218
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,940
Let me bust his ass.
Come on!

219
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,660
What?
Let me take care of this.

220
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,620
Hello, my friend, how are you?

221
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,220
I need to talk to you.

222
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,620
What about?

223
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,900
The two Americans that were killed.

224
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,420
Come to the police station.

225
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,860
The police station?

226
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,540
If you have any questions, ask me
here.

227
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,060
Look, little man.
You comin' with...

228
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,020
Oh, my Lord.

229
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,340
I would like to pay you
for that laptop.

230
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,340
- I think I should do that.
- No problem.

231
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,660
I seen it on the Internet,
with a DVD player.

232
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,180
- That's an old model.
- Now, I must excuse myself.

233
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,980
Inspector.

234
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,780
Have a good day.

235
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,340
I was...

236
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:25,220
Lee, why didn't you tell me
this man rolls like this?

237
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,060
- I told you already!
- No, you didn't!

238
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,700
- What you said?
- I did this.

239
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,580
What do this mean?
Speak English to me!

240
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,100
That means I go this way
and you go this way.

241
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,500
- I go that way, you go this way?
- Yes.

242
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,700
- Sorry.
- Carter!

243
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,500
Y'all look alike!
Watch out!

244
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,620
No wonder you mad.

245
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,100
Don't worry. It's OK.

246
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,140
You better get
the hell outta here.

247
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,740
- Flip me!
- What?

248
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,180
Flip me!

249
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,020
Damn!

250
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,780
Lee!

251
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,140
No, no, no!

252
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,020
Lee!

253
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,980
YAU MA TEl POLICE STATION

254
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:53,900
Look, you've been ordered
by the Ministry of Public Security...

255
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:57,740
to assist the F.B.I. and Secret Service
in our investigation...

256
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,060
to provide us
with whatever we need.

257
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:03,580
You have information,
it belongs to us.

258
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,500
This is still Hong Kong.

259
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,980
Two Americans have been killed
on United States government property.

260
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,900
Give me two copies of that.

261
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,220
This is our investigation.

262
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:17,260
Chief Inspector Lee
will supervise your people.

263
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,500
No, he will report to me.

264
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,780
Do we understand each other?

265
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,180
What the hell is that?

266
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,660
That is, uh...

267
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,380
Chief Inspector Lee.

268
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,860
I ain't never been humiliated
and embarrassed like that...

269
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,780
in my whole entire life.

270
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,260
Got me runnin' around Hong Kong
butt-naked, thanks to you.

271
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,180
- Thanks to me?
- Yeah, thanks to you.

272
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,300
You needed backup,
so I gave you backup.

273
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:48,580
I was about to kick Ricky Tan's ass, and
his bodyguards', till you messed it up.

274
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,540
- Stop. I'm sick of your bullshit.
- I'm sick of you!

275
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,980
I'm not the one runnin' up
in karaoke bars full of gangsters.

276
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:57,020
And I'm not the one runnin' up in
massage parlors lookin' for crime lords.

277
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,180
- It's my job.
- It's yourjob.

278
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,740
You pitiful, man.
When are you gonna have some fun?

279
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,660
When are you gonna take a day off?
When are you gonna go on a date?

280
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:07,540
- I have plenty of dates.
- When's the last time you had a date?

281
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,380
When's the last time you played
"hide the rainbow roll"?

282
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,460
Huh? Let's hear it, Lee.
The Year of the Rat?

283
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,460
You will never understand me.

284
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:18,660
You right, 'cause I didn't even
understand what you just said to me.

285
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:27,100
They got my passport
back at that massage parlor.

286
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,660
Good afternoon, sir.

287
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,260
- Lee?
- Yes, sir.

288
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:37,100
This is Special Agent Sterling
from the United States Secret Service.

289
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,020
Secret Service? Why?

290
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,940
Have a seat, please.

291
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:45,100
What I'm about to tell you
cannot leave this room.

292
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:48,940
The men who were killed yesterday
were not American translators.

293
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,460
They were undercover
United States Customs agents...

294
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,540
trying to break
a Triad smuggling ring.

295
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,460
- Smuggling what?
- We don't know.

296
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,540
But whatever it is,
it got the agents killed.

297
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,460
How can we help you?

298
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,740
You can stay the hell
out of our way.

299
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:09,460
- Thank you.
- I can get you Ricky Tan.

300
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,820
No. We know all about Tan.

301
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,060
That's why we're leaving
him out there as bait.

302
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,820
This is a lot bigger
than Ricky Tan...

303
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:19,380
and the Fu Cang Long Triads.

304
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,980
Hey, cutie.

305
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,500
Thank you, Lee.

306
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,620
Carter! Carter!

307
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,740
Heaven on Earth massage parlor?

308
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,300
Heaven on Earth?

309
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,420
Hello. Cheap suits.

310
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:32,500
Hello. Cheap suits.
Cheap suits.

311
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,740
- Cheap suits. Cheap suits.
- How cheap?

312
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:37,460
- Cheap suits.
- Cheap as hell?

313
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,140
Excuse me.

314
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:58,420
Can you direct me to Heaven on Earth
massage parlor, please?

315
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:01,180
- Hello. How are you?
- OK.

316
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,780
No, no.
Wait a minute.

317
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,740
I don't want no chicken.

318
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,940
I don't want no chicken!
What am I gonna do with a chicken?

319
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,860
I don't like
my chickens live, OK?

320
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,220
I like 'em dead and deep-fried.
You ever heard of Popeye's?

321
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:23,660
No, no! No!
Don't kill chicken.

322
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,100
Yes.

323
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,180
I'm warning you.
I'm a police officer.

324
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,580
Put the blade down
and let the bird go right now!

325
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,340
You OK, Lee?

326
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,460
All he wanted was some mu shu.

327
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:00,980
Damn.

328
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,740
Hey, taxi! Taxi!

329
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,740
Follow that car.

330
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:14,620
Follow that limo. This is a chase.
Wherever he goes, you go.

331
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:18,100
You're not movin'!
This is the opposite of chasin'!

332
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,220
What? I will slap you
if you don't move this car.

333
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:25,020
I'm gonna slap you.
I'm gonna slap you.

334
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,820
All right.
OK, look. Here.

335
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,780
You understand that?

336
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,780
- Now you're speaking my language.
- Get the hell on then.

337
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,900
Come on, let's go!

338
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:28,900
We just heard Ricky Tan is throwing
a party on his boat tonight.

339
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,180
Did you tell Sterling?

340
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:35,180
Let him find out on his own. I want
the Hong Kong Police handling this.

341
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:05,020
Wait right here.
I'll be right back.

342
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:07,980
- You understand?
- Yes, I understand!

343
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,180
And don't eat my chicken, OK?

344
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,020
Jesus!

345
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,140
How you doin', baby?

346
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:37,500
Carter, James Carter.
Baldwin Hills.

347
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,620
Isabella Molina.
From San Juan.

348
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,860
San Juan?
I know San Juan.

349
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,860
I've traveled there many times
on my private plane.

350
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:49,820
You must know my friend Pedro Morales
Magonzales Marato Molaso Mondustos.

351
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:52,100
- I don't think so.
- You sure?

352
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,820
Well, I'm sorry. I thought
you rode in the best circles.

353
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:57,060
But listen.
Make yourself feel at home.

354
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:01,100
You need anything... champagne,
caviar... my yacht is your yacht.

355
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,780
This is your yacht?

356
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,860
That's right.
I'm the owner.

357
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:08,580
The captain.
El capitan.

358
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,660
- El capitan?
- Yes. Listen.

359
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:15,300
I'm not gonna play games with you.
I want you right now.

360
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:18,180
I see me and you downstairs
in one of those bathrooms...

361
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,100
in about five minutes.

362
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:23,420
Well, I'm very tempted.
It's such a beautiful yacht.

363
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,700
What's it called?

364
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:29,820
- What's it called?
- Mm-hmm. Your yacht.

365
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:33,820
- The S.S. Minnow Johnson.
- The S.S. Minnow Johnson?

366
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:36,500
Funny. The name on the back
was The Red Dragon.

367
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,340
The Red Dragon?
Are you sure?

368
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,620
Oh, I'm sure.
Because this is my friend's yacht.

369
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,780
- Your friend's yacht?
- And this is his party.

370
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:47,460
I must've got on the wrong yacht.
All these yachts look alike these days.

371
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:50,420
I knew somethin' was wrong
when my key didn't work.

372
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:54,540
- Who's your friend?
- Somebody on the wrong yacht.

373
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:57,380
Wait a second. I know you.
Steven Reign, right?

374
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:00,540
You own half of Los Angeles.
What you doin' here in Hong Kong?

375
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,780
I'm here for the weekend,
taking in the sights.

376
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,860
You must have your own plane too.
It's fun, ain't it?

377
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,460
- Shall we?
- Yes.

378
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:12,020
Well, enjoy the party,
Mr. Carter.

379
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,940
I plan to, Ms. Isabella.

380
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:17,380
See you later, Stevie.
Be cool.

381
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:33,220
- Ricky Tan. Where is he?
- I don't know!

382
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:36,180
He killed a detective today.
Where is he?

383
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,940
Who got killed, man?

384
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,820
- Carter!
- Who died, Lee?

385
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,820
- You!
- Detective Yu?

386
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,740
- Not Yu, you!
- Who?

387
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,180
- You!
- Who?

388
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:49,980
Do you understand the words
that are coming out of my mouth?

389
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:53,500
Don't nobody understand the words
that are comin' out of your mouth, man.

390
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,060
Ricky Tan is waiting for you.

391
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,540
What the hell
is going on here, Lee?

392
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:06,100
Remember I told you
my father was a policeman?

393
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,260
- Ricky Tan was his partner.
- What?

394
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,620
Hu Li, you disappoint me.

395
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,580
Have you forgotten where you're
from?

396
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,580
Don't forget who you work for.

397
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:20,100
You think you could ever be a
leader?

398
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,540
Lee, I've been expecting you.

399
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,580
Please ask your partner
to wait inside.

400
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,140
- I ain't goin' nowhere.
- It's OK.

401
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,780
- I'm not leavin' you alone.
- I'll be fine.

402
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,820
- You sure?
- Yes.

403
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,300
I'll be right upstairs.

404
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:48,020
I know what everybody's saying.

405
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,940
I did not blow up
the American embassy.

406
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,900
I'm not that stupid.

407
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,860
But I believe
some of my people did.

408
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:00,420
My enemies
are trying to frame me.

409
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:03,780
There is a war going on
right now within the Triads.

410
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,940
I'm afraid I'm gonna
lose this time.

411
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:11,260
If your father were still alive,
I would turn to him for advice.

412
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,580
Please don't.

413
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,780
Lee, I really need your help.
I cannot trust anybody else.

414
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,420
Tell me why they killed
the customs agents.

415
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:22,260
I'll give you all
the information you need...

416
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:26,140
but you've gotta get me
out of Hong Kong right away.

417
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,220
Lady, what are you doin'?

418
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,620
Get down.
I'm L.A.P.D.

419
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:15,820
You just kick me?
You must be outta your mind!

420
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:19,140
You want some of me? I'm gonna
give you an L.A.P.D. Ass-kickin'!

421
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,220
- You OK?
- Yeah.

422
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,940
I slipped and I fell. Hey.

423
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,940
- What?
- Am I bleedin'?

424
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:06,220
Quite a night, Inspector.

425
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:09,420
Ricky Tan was our only bait.
Now he's gone.

426
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:13,740
So you got your revenge, at the expense
of a U.S. Government investigation.

427
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,660
What are you talkin'
about, revenge?

428
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,460
Now, I don't know if the Triads
paid you to get rid of Tan...

429
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,820
or if it was a pure
vendetta killing...

430
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:24,220
or if you're involved in the smuggling
yourself, but you're off this case.

431
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:26,620
I don't ever wanna see you again.
Is that clear?

432
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:29,460
- What's goin' on here?
- Carter, you're in enough trouble.

433
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:32,220
Just shut up.
Stay out of it.

434
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,300
You're goin' back to L.A.
Right now.

435
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:37,980
That's fine with me, man.
I ain't had fun since I been out here.

436
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,580
Sorry, Lee.

437
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,940
Escort Detective Carter
to the airport.

438
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,580
I'll take him.

439
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,060
Get your hands off!

440
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:03,340
- Carter, you don't understand.
- I understand, all right.

441
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,740
I got knocked off a building,
I got beat on...

442
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:09,380
I got stripped butt-naked,
and you held out on me, man.

443
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,580
I'm outta here.

444
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:20,540
Carter, Ricky Tan
set up my father.

445
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,220
What?

446
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:31,940
Five years ago, my father was working
a big international smuggling case.

447
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,860
He found out his partner, Tan,
was working for the Triads.

448
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:38,940
But before he could prove it,
he was killed.

449
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,940
All the evidence disappeared...

450
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:43,420
Tan resigned,
and the case was never solved.

451
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,820
I get it now. This is all about
your daddy's last case.

452
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,900
You gettin' on the plane
with me or not?

453
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,140
What?

454
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,900
You know my daddy
died on the job too.

455
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:01,740
If I had a chance to square his death,
I'd do whatever it took.

456
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:05,140
I'd do anything.
So you comin' or what?

457
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,100
Why L.A.?

458
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:18,580
Lee, let me introduce you to Carter's
theory of criminal investigation:

459
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,500
Follow the rich white man.

460
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:24,300
- Follow the rich white man?
- Exactly. Now you're learning.

461
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:27,740
Every big crime has a rich white man
behind it waitin' for his cut.

462
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:30,140
Now in our case,
we know who the rich white man is.

463
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,060
- Steven Reign.
- Who?

464
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,820
Steven Reign, the hotel billionaire.
I saw him on Ricky Tan's boat.

465
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,220
When the shootin' started,
he was way too cool.

466
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,740
When people start shootin',
white people ain't that cool.

467
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:42,060
They either runnin' around,
hidin' behind tables...

468
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:45,100
or screamin' like, "aah!"

469
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,740
You sound like that
all the time.

470
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,740
Let me tell you somethin'
about black people.

471
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:51,140
When stuff goes down,
we keep our cool.

472
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:54,340
Maybe, but not like Asians.
We never panic.

473
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:56,980
Right. When Godzilla's comin',
y'all be trippin'.

474
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,620
I seen the movie.
You be, "Gaica, gaica!"

475
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,500
Yellin' everywhere.
I seen Chinamen...

476
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,060
Mr. Carter, excuse me.

477
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,340
Thank you so much.
It's the kosher meal?

478
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,460
- Yes, that is our kosher meal.
- Shalom.

479
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:16,100
REIGN TOWERS
Los Angeles

480
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:23,980
There he is, right there,
Mr. Steven Reign...

481
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,620
livin' large in one
of his penthouse suites.

482
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:32,100
Oh, guess who this is.
Yep, that's her.

483
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:35,100
That's the woman that was
on Ricky Tan's boat, right there.

484
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,740
We got 'em.

485
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:39,460
Told you it'd work out.
Know what I'm talkin' about.

486
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,460
All we gotta do now is wait.

487
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,140
They still talkin'?

488
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,900
He's leaving.

489
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,900
- He'll be back.
- How do you know?

490
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:51,060
I know. You see how fine
that woman is?

491
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,180
He'll definitely be back.

492
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,980
What's she doing?

493
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,540
What's she doin', man?

494
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:08,420
She's just standing around,
not doing much.

495
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:12,620
Just don't fall asleep. Sooner or later,
something's gonna happen.

496
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:16,340
OK, I just try to stay awake.
It's just so boring.

497
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,900
Oh. Slow down, baby.

498
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,140
What?

499
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:28,020
- Nothing. I said nothing.
- You said somethin'.

500
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,900
- I said nothing.
- I heard you.

501
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:32,180
No. Nothing.

502
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,780
Lee, what's goin' on?
What you talkin' about?

503
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:48,580
- She's getting undressed.
- What?

504
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,820
- She's just getting undressed.
- Give me that!

505
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:53,900
No! It's not right!

506
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:56,460
- Lord, have mercy!
- What?

507
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:59,020
- She took her skirt off.
- I cannot hear this.

508
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:01,420
Black panties, black bra...

509
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:05,460
Victoria's Secret,
spring catalogue, page 27.

510
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,020
Girl got class.

511
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,860
Let me look a little closer.
Oh, look at that.

512
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,900
Got a little tattoo.
That's cute.

513
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:14,060
Looks like Snoopy.

514
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,540
- Snoopy?
- Yeah.

515
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:18,700
- I love Snoopy.
- I love Snoopy too. Let me look.

516
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,660
Hold up.
Wait a minute.

517
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:23,340
She's goin' to the door.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

518
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,260
She's openin' the door.

519
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:30,100
Look like somebody
droppin' off a package.

520
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,140
Wait a minute.

521
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:35,740
Look like the same girl who dropped
off the package at your office.

522
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,220
It's a bomb!

523
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,860
Watch out!

524
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:47,220
It's this one right here.
Lady, you got a bomb in there!

525
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,100
Open that door!

526
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:51,020
Kick the door.

527
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,980
- Damn, you fine.
- Carter!

528
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,660
- Come on, Lee!
- Where?

529
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:02,860
- Don't drop it! This way!
- Where should we go?

530
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,860
Roof! Roof!

531
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,860
Don't trip! Be careful!

532
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,980
- Throw it, Lee!
- Where?

533
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,780
Lee, throw it!
Throw the bomb over the edge!

534
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,220
Throw it! Throw it!

535
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:22,460
- Throw it over the edge!
- There's people down there!

536
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:25,140
- Lee, throw it!
- Carter!

537
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:27,420
- Lee! Throw it!
- No!

538
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,340
We about to die!

539
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,060
OK, get on your feet.

540
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:40,220
- Enough, all right?
- Put that down!

541
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:42,140
- It's a bomb!
- Put that down!

542
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:45,060
Guys, no bomb.
Nothing.

543
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:48,700
Now stay away before I throw you
both in jail for obstruction.

544
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:50,740
Throw us in jail?

545
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:53,460
You must be outta your mind.
I'm about to bust you right now.

546
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:56,420
I'm an undercover agent for
the United States Secret Service.

547
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:59,140
How do we know that?
Show me a badge right now.

548
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:01,140
Here you go.

549
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:05,660
Let me see that again.
I didn't get a good look at that.

550
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:08,380
We can help you.
I'm a detective from Hong Kong.

551
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,940
I know who you are,
Inspector Lee. I know.

552
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:14,260
We need to go out of sight,
so come down to my suite.

553
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,540
- Why did you say it was a bomb?
- No, you said that.

554
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,780
- No, you said it.
- You said that in the hotel room.

555
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,780
I said she was the bomb.

556
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,180
She was the bomb?

557
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,980
Look, I've been working
this case for months now...

558
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,020
so if I seem a little
aggravated, I apologize.

559
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,940
You need to tell us
what's goin' on.

560
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:36,580
The Triads and Reign think
I'm a crooked customs agent.

561
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:39,780
- Is that a payoff?
- No. That's a sample.

562
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,820
You guys ever heard
of the Superbill?

563
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:44,220
I heard of it. It's a myth.
Some kind of counterfeit.

564
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:47,660
Honey, it's much more
than a counterfeit.

565
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:50,820
Fourteen out of fifteen world banks
can't even tell the difference.

566
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:52,460
The paper is Crane linen blend...

567
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:55,340
and the bills are printed
on U.S. Intaglio presses.

568
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:58,220
You wanna tell us how they get into
the U.S. Mint to use the presses?

569
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:01,740
In 1959, the United States was
very friendly with the Shah of Iran.

570
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:04,140
Why? Because we wanted his oil.

571
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,060
Our government
gave him a gift...

572
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:08,060
a U.S. Treasury
intaglio printing press.

573
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:10,260
Now, it's the only one
to ever leave the country.

574
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,860
Five years ago, Ricky Tan bought
the press on the black market.

575
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:14,620
Five years ago?

576
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:16,620
That's right before
he left the force.

577
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:20,180
Ricky Tan got hold of one-of-a-kind
Swiss-made hundred-dollar plates...

578
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,100
and he started printing
Superbills.

579
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:24,780
That's why Hu Li killed him...
for the plates.

580
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:28,780
And they've printed and shipped
one hundred million dollars.

581
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:34,340
There's only one way
to spot a fake.

582
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:37,300
They use an optical transfer ink
from India that burns red.

583
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:41,020
You see? Now, the real ink,
it burns black.

584
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:47,980
You know, Carter, I believe
you're asking the wrong question.

585
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:51,580
The real question is,
where are the plates?

586
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:54,940
Because if we can find the plates,
we can stop the whole operation.

587
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:57,700
- Right?
- Yeah, you're right.

588
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:00,500
Maybe this is where
you can help us, guys.

589
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:03,780
Yeah. Carter,
this is your city, right?

590
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:06,940
Yeah, this is my titty.
I mean, this is my city.

591
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:10,900
Great. And Lee, you know
Hu Li and the Triads, correct?

592
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:12,940
- Yes.
- Great.

593
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:16,860
Can you do me a favor? Can you find out
where Hu Li's keeping the plates?

594
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:19,060
- That ain't no problem.
- Thank you.

595
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:21,060
So welcome aboard, gentlemen.

596
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:24,940
From now on, you're officially working
for the United States Secret Service.

597
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:30,180
Secret Service agent
James Carter.

598
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:33,420
That sounds good.
It's got a nice ring to it, don't it?

599
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:35,340
I'm tellin' you, Lee,
give me six months.

600
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:38,820
Six months and I'll be in Washington,
D.C., protectin' the president.

601
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:41,460
We both know you would never
take a bullet for someone else.

602
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:43,380
Yeah, but they don't know that.

603
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,940
I'm gonna talk to Isabella,
see if she can hook somethin' up.

604
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:49,780
- Seein' how she stared at a brother.
- She never even look at you.

605
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:52,260
Justjealous, Lee,
'cause the girl chose me...

606
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:55,620
'cause I'm tall, dark and handsome,
and you Third-World ugly.

607
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:57,860
I'm not Third-World ugly.
Women like me.

608
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:00,980
They think I'm cute,
like Snoopy.

609
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:03,820
Lee, Snoopy is six inches
taller than you.

610
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:10,740
Lee and Carter are officially
out of the Secret Service's way.

611
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:12,660
Correct.

612
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:33,940
This is my informant's place.
They got pretty good ribs here too.

613
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:35,860
I like kosher.

614
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:46,060
Hey. Hey, wait.

615
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:56,540
Oh, I know I don't think I see
what I see what I'm thinkin'!

616
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:58,940
I know good and well
y'all ain't gamblin' back here!

617
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:01,820
- This is supposed to be a restaurant!
- What you doin' here, James?

618
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:04,340
You about to go to jail,
and all your little friends.

619
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:06,860
Everybody pack up your stuff
and let's get outta here.

620
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:09,340
- All right, let's talk outside.
- You wanna talk outside?

621
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:10,300
Yes.

622
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:13,380
Let's go if you wanna talk.
As long as you wanna talk.

623
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:18,740
Where you get that from?
I like that.

624
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:20,900
That's good.
What's up, Kenny?

625
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:23,740
- James Carter.
- What's up?

626
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:27,460
I heard you was gettin' your ass kicked
out there in Hong Kong, brother.

627
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:29,380
- What?
- That's right.

628
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,620
- Who told you that?
- I got my sources.

629
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:34,220
- Don't you worry about that.
- They tellin' you lies.

630
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:36,860
Look, I'm about to bust you
if you don't give me some information.

631
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:40,020
How you gonna come up here
and jam me up like this, James?

632
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:44,060
You embarrass me in front
of my wife, my kids out there.

633
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:45,980
Kenny, you embarrassin' yourself.

634
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:48,540
You a black man with
a Chinese restaurant on Crenshaw.

635
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:51,660
You come up in here,
you ain't show me no badge.

636
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:53,660
You ain't even
flashed a warrant.

637
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:57,820
Know what I'm gonna do for you?
I'm gonna whup your ass.

638
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,740
And then I'm gonna
whup your ass.

639
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:02,060
Kenny, we'd love to see that.
We would.

640
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:03,900
- Come on, Kenny!
- Come on!

641
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:05,060
- Come on!
- Do it!

642
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:06,580
I'll shoot you and say
you fell in the kitchen.

643
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,300
- Come on!
- You better chill out.

644
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:11,620
- Kenny, calm down, Kenny!
- What...

645
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:23,060
Twisting Tiger.

646
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:27,580
Where did you learn that?

647
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:29,340
Master Ching taught me.

648
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:30,740
Master Ching from Beijing?

649
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:32,780
No... Freddy Ching's in Crenshaw.

650
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:35,660
Oh. They're brothers.

651
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:37,940
Oh, all right, all right.

652
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:40,220
Why are you hanging out with 7-11?

653
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:41,540
7-11?

654
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:44,340
Because his mouth never closes.

655
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:50,460
Hey! I heard that.
I heard that.

656
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:52,540
Don't be talkin' about me, man.

657
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:55,300
- You're here about some funny money?
- How you know?

658
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:57,620
- C-notes, right?
- Yeah.

659
00:47:57,740 --> 00:47:59,700
Any of 'em came through here?

660
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:03,060
One of my regulars
came in a few days ago...

661
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:05,900
dropped about 50 large
on the tables in there.

662
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:08,660
I was about to go down there
with my boys and tune his ass up...

663
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:10,740
but he comes in the next day
with the whole thing.

664
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:13,540
Brand-new one hundred dollar
bills, sequential.

665
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:16,380
I figure they're fake, 'cause
this guy's got a regular day job.

666
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,780
So I test 'em,
and they checked out.

667
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:20,980
You still have the bills?

668
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:23,300
Still got my lunch money
from the third grade.

669
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:24,620
Let me see 'em.

670
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:49,420
Hold it.
What are you doin'?

671
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,380
It's fake.

672
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:59,340
He got you.
Who you say gave that to you?

673
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:02,300
Cat named Zing.
Work down at Reign Plaza.

674
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:04,940
You better hope
you find him before I do.

675
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:30,940
Excuse me. L.A.P.D.

676
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:33,140
We're lookin' for
a guy named Zing.

677
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:37,620
Come here!
Come back here!

678
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:40,420
Hey! Hey!
You little rascal!

679
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:44,140
Get back here!
Get back here right now!

680
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:56,780
The great Chief Inspector Lee.

681
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:02,020
I'll be remembered for
getting rid of you.

682
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:04,500
Know what? I don't even know
why the hell I'm here.

683
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:06,700
I ain't even Chinese.

684
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:08,620
All right, I'm sorry.

685
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:13,460
I think there's someone who
would like to talk to them first.

686
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:24,660
What'd you do that for?
That was unnecessary!

687
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:32,660
You knocked out my filling, girl.
That's gonna cost you.

688
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:39,380
I ain't never hit a woman in my life,
but your ass is pushin' it!

689
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:45,300
OK, all right.
I'll go.

690
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:50,380
Better watch your back.

691
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:27,780
What happened?

692
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:31,180
That lady Isabella knock you out.
She played you.

693
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:32,620
- No.
- Yes, she did.

694
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:34,540
- She save our life.
- What?

695
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:36,940
- Hu Li could have killed us.
- Are you crazy, man?

696
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:39,380
Look at us.
We good as dead!

697
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:42,380
- Stop your whining!
- What you gonna do if I don't stop?

698
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,660
I will slap the hell
outta you right now, Lee.

699
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:48,900
- I'll bitch-slap you back to Africa!
- You will?

700
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:51,820
Let me see that.
I wanna see you do that!

701
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:54,500
You don't know
who you're messin' with, man!

702
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:56,420
You don't know
who you're messin' with, do you?

703
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:59,380
- I'll bite your damn nose off.
- You bite... Come on!

704
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:11,820
I don't trust her.

705
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:13,820
It's a mistake having her here.

706
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:16,820
Our orders are to leave her alone.

707
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:25,260
I want to slice those pretty lips
right off her face

708
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:29,260
and bury her in the desert
with those two cops.

709
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:33,660
Some apple?

710
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:38,740
I'd put that knife away, bitch,
before you have an accident.

711
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:50,420
Ain't no use, man.

712
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:52,940
Just tell me how the Triads
are gonna kill us.

713
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:55,780
They will torture us
for three days.

714
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:59,980
- I can handle that.
- Then they'll cut off our egg rolls.

715
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:02,220
Cut off our egg rolls?
Hell, no!

716
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:05,580
Let's get the hell outta here!
Come on, don't give up!

717
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:15,420
- I don't wanna die!
- Be quiet.

718
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:19,420
- OK, give me your left leg.
- What for?

719
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:20,540
Left leg!

720
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:21,980
Like this.

721
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:26,100
- Hold tight.
- OK.

722
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:38,900
That's it.
Bite that thing.

723
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:40,940
Bite it like a little monkey!

724
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:42,980
Bite it! There you go.

725
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:45,340
Yank it!
Use them tiger teeth!

726
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:47,700
Yeah! Grab it!
Pull on it!

727
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:50,060
You almost got it.
That's it.

728
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:51,980
Oh, shit!

729
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:54,420
- What the hell?
- Wow!

730
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:56,780
Lee, untie me.
Hurry up, man!

731
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:00,500
All these statues full of money.

732
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:10,940
Hello, Benjamin!

733
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:16,300
- What are you doing?
- I'm takin' this for evidence.

734
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:21,900
You feel that?

735
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:24,180
Yeah. We slowin' down, man.

736
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:40,860
- What happened?
- I'll tell you what happened.

737
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:45,100
Come on, Lee!

738
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:51,020
Carter, go up.

739
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:22,340
- What happened?
- You left me.

740
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:24,660
I didn't leave you.
I was waitin' up there for you.

741
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:41,100
Whoa, man!
I ain't goin' in there!

742
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:43,020
- Come on!
- There's rats in there!

743
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:45,140
- There's no rats!
- Look at that rat!

744
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:07,380
Las Vegas?

745
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:12,060
What the hell we doin' in Vegas?

746
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:14,500
Look.
Red Dragon.

747
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:17,180
That's the name
of Ricky Tan's boat.

748
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:19,180
Lee.

749
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:24,900
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

750
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:26,420
- Sorry.
- Damn!

751
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:28,980
One at a time.
What the hell is wrong with you?

752
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:34,980
- Wait a second, man.
- What?

753
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,900
- We can't go in there like this.
- Why?

754
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:39,140
- We got to look fly.
- What you mean, "fly"?

755
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:41,060
We got to mack out.
We can't go in like this.

756
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:42,500
What does it mean,
"mack out"?

757
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:44,900
Follow me, my Asian brother.
I'll show you.

758
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:46,900
Come on.

759
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:55,860
That's where we're going.

760
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:58,060
When we get in there,
you stay a couple steps behind me.

761
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:01,100
You smell a little funky.
I think you stepped in rat shit.

762
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:05,340
It was a cowboy hat,
and now it's a pith helmet.

763
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:07,620
Hold on.
Talk to you in a bit.

764
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:09,180
Hi.
Can I help you?

765
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:11,980
Yeah, I'm gonna need
black, 42 long...

766
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:14,300
and nothing touches this body
but pure silk.

767
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:16,900
And get my partner something
from the kids' department.

768
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:18,860
Would your partner like to be
wrapped in silk as well?

769
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:22,220
Some people think it's tacky,
but I enjoy it when couples dress alike.

770
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:24,460
No, this ain't no
couple thing, man.

771
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:27,060
We're police officers on
a dangerous case, and we need clothes.

772
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:28,980
Yes.
There are a lot of men chasing us.

773
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:31,980
As well they should be.
You have nothing to worry about, OK?

774
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:33,940
Because I'm gonna turn you two
into the belle of the ball.

775
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:36,780
- Thank you.
- Absolutely. Let's start with you.

776
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:40,380
You've got a mochaccino face, wonderful
skin, and the big, broad shoulders.

777
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:43,100
Let's put a dead animal
on you. Croc skin.

778
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:45,020
Butter cream, croc skin,
butter cream...

779
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:46,980
What size is the waist?
Let's go in.

780
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:49,260
Hey!
Watch it, sweetness!

781
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:51,700
- He's got some fire to him.
- Honey cups!

782
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:53,860
- I like that.
- Go get the clothes! Hurry up!

783
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:57,620
I'll pull some items.
Oh, Jesus. Li'I Kim, I'll be back.

784
00:57:57,740 --> 00:58:01,220
- You see that?
- He likes you.

785
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:03,660
I'm not shopping
with you no more.

786
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:14,980
- Act like you're rich.
- Ladies and gentlemen...

787
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:17,060
Steven Reign...

788
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:21,340
owner and founder
of the Red Dragon Casino.

789
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:22,980
Thank you.

790
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:29,220
Thank you.
Good evening.

791
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:32,740
A thousand years ago, a small,
wealthy village in China...

792
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:36,180
hired a young dragon
to guard their treasures in a cave.

793
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:39,940
The people of the village
started sneaking him extra food...

794
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:41,980
hoping to make him stronger.

795
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:44,380
The dragon grew so big
he got stuck...

796
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:47,620
and the treasure
was trapped behind him...

797
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:49,540
for all eternity.

798
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:53,900
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have found that lost treasure.

799
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:59,100
It is here, inside
the greatest casino in the world!

800
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:01,220
Welcome to the Red Dragon...

801
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:03,540
where everybody is a winner!

802
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:25,820
Black, 29.

803
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:34,180
Look at this place, Lee.
It's the biggest front in the world.

804
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:35,820
Yeah, right...

805
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:39,740
- Would you like a drink?
- Cigarettes?

806
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:45,580
- Put your arms around me.
- What?

807
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:47,660
Hold me close.
There are cameras everywhere.

808
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:51,940
- What's going on?
- I think I may be in trouble, Lee.

809
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:53,980
I really need your help.

810
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:56,980
Last time you needed my help,
I woke up in a truck.

811
00:59:57,140 --> 01:00:00,740
I'm undercover, Lee. I had no choice.
You have to trust me.

812
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:03,940
Look over my right shoulder.
That's the soft count room.

813
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,380
We think the plates are in there.

814
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:09,380
- I need you to go and get them.
- Why don't you go get them?

815
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:13,180
Because if I'm wrong, then my entire
cover is blown. You understand?

816
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:17,260
How do I know I can trust you?

817
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:18,780
Dip me.

818
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:23,500
I'm asking for real now.

819
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:25,700
Will you help the Secret Service?

820
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:39,860
What are you doing?
Thank you, man. Take this.

821
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:43,060
- Dancing.
- Dancing?

822
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:45,380
Man, I'm up here working,
putting my life on the line...

823
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:48,340
and you're up here,
dancing with some bimbo?

824
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:50,900
- Does she have a friend?
- That was Isabella.

825
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:53,500
She says the plates are
in the soft count room.

826
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:56,260
I know you didn'tjust say Isabella.
Are you crazy, man?

827
01:00:56,380 --> 01:00:59,180
- That girl is setting you up again.
- No. I'm gonna find out.

828
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:01,140
No, wait, man.

829
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:05,700
There's security all over. If you're
gonna do this, you need a distraction.

830
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:09,100
So keep your eye on me, and you'll
know when to make your move.

831
01:01:09,220 --> 01:01:10,260
- Good.
- Cool.

832
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:20,580
- Come on, big eight!
- Come on, Tex!

833
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:24,900
Hey, hey, hey!
Good roll, man!

834
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:28,500
This table's hot! I want some
of this money. Get me in this game.

835
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:36,180
Let me have a Diet Pepsi
and some hot wings.

836
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:38,900
- 100,000. Give him the chips.
- Let's play! I'm gonna get some!

837
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:41,500
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's this?

838
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:48,580
No, sir. I did not.
I just assumed that...

839
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:55,060
- Is that it?
- No, I didn't think that at all, sir.

840
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:57,020
- You a racist?
- No, I'm not, sir.

841
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:03,580
- How did that happen?
- Itjust happened. I'm sorry.

842
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:07,740
This is crazy. You think my people
suffered 362 years of slavery...

843
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:12,700
Do I look like Chicken George to you?

844
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:14,700
- You do not.
- What the hell is that?

845
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:18,180
- I think you should calm down.
- I think you should go count something.

846
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:23,100
Hurry up. I just want to be treated
fairly. Is that too much to ask?

847
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:26,340
- No.
- Is that too much to ask?

848
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:27,940
I got a problem on table nine.

849
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:39,580
Why are no black people performing
in this hotel? We ain't good enough?

850
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:41,660
We got Lionel Richie
performing here tonight.

851
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:43,860
Lionel Richie ain't been black
since the Commodores, man.

852
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:46,540
What about Peaches and Herb?
Gladys Knight and the Pips?

853
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:50,180
Ike and Tina? They can get
back together. This is crazy.

854
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:52,940
Sir, why don't you calm down,
win some money and have some fun?

855
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:55,780
I ain't calmin' down no more!
I'm sick of you tryin' to calm me down.

856
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:58,580
We got a problem.
Go.

857
01:03:14,060 --> 01:03:16,420
I have a dream...

858
01:03:16,540 --> 01:03:19,460
that white people
and black people...

859
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:22,500
and even Chinese people
can gamble together...

860
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:24,420
without gettin' different chips!

861
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:26,260
Hallelujah!

862
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:33,980
Hold it. In the spirit of brotherhood,
let's just play craps, man.

863
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:35,900
Come on. Let's go.
Come on!

864
01:03:56,380 --> 01:03:57,780
Oh, shit.

865
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:42,020
Get him! Stop!

866
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:21,020
Inspector Lee, this is a
ying-tao grenade.

867
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:22,820
Please follow me.

868
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:25,660
Or I'll push this detonator,

869
01:05:25,980 --> 01:05:28,580
and blow your 32 teeth
into your brain.

870
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:32,660
Winner.

871
01:05:32,780 --> 01:05:35,700
Yes!
Yes, yes, yes!

872
01:05:35,820 --> 01:05:38,780
I feel good.
Who put their hand on my butt?

873
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:40,980
Do it again. Give me that.
How much I win?

874
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:42,900
200,000, sir.

875
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:47,580
All right.

876
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:50,060
This seven I'm about to roll...

877
01:05:50,180 --> 01:05:53,220
is for the 27 years Mandela spent in
that prison and couldn't getjustice...

878
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:54,540
and took all that crap.

879
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:58,900
That's why I ain't gonna crap out.
This one is for Mandela!

880
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:02,220
A winner. Seven.

881
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:21,980
Out.

882
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:29,580
Imagine a business
where people hand you money...

883
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:33,980
and you hand them back
absolutely nothing.

884
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:39,460
Now, that's
the real American dream.

885
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:41,540
Thanks to a few pieces of metal...

886
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:45,540
and a most beautiful
U.S. Customs agent...

887
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:47,860
I'm back in business.

888
01:06:53,540 --> 01:06:55,420
Look at you, Lee.

889
01:06:55,540 --> 01:06:57,340
You look ridiculous.

890
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:03,180
You know it didn't have
to be like this.

891
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:05,460
It's too bad.

892
01:07:05,580 --> 01:07:08,260
Like father, like son.

893
01:07:09,980 --> 01:07:11,780
He's headed for the penthouse.

894
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:16,700
Look at this old fool.

895
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:21,180
What does he think he's doing?

896
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:24,060
I tell you, it's almost impossible
to find a partner...

897
01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:26,820
that is trustworthy and loyal.

898
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:30,100
Don't you agree, Lee?

899
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:33,380
Everything stays on the table.
Don't nobody touch it. You understand?

900
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:38,460
Winner, four high.

901
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:47,020
- Yes!
- Come on, sir.

902
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:52,460
Tell them to get rid of Lee's friend.

903
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:54,940
- Cash me out.
- Sir, get off the table.

904
01:07:55,100 --> 01:07:57,540
Thank you very much.

905
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:03,460
The trouble
with partners is, they die.

906
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:05,780
As will you.

907
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:13,580
Have fun.

908
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:25,660
After I'm through with you you'll be
begging me to push this button.

909
01:08:29,260 --> 01:08:32,860
Don't move! U.S. Secret Service!
You're under arrest.

910
01:08:48,860 --> 01:08:51,420
These gentlemen will escort you
to the cashier.

911
01:08:51,540 --> 01:08:54,740
Good, 'cause I don't want to getjumped
by these rich white folks. Let's go.

912
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:19,940
I appreciate this, fellas.
You never can be too safe.

913
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:31,580
What the...

914
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:34,900
I'm sorry, man.
Did that hurt?

915
01:09:35,020 --> 01:09:36,220
Hey, you! Hold it!

916
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:39,260
You OK?

917
01:09:57,460 --> 01:09:59,620
Black man get on a roll,
y'all start trippin'.

918
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:01,580
- Y'all get back!
- Calm down!

919
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:06,220
Get back! Get back!
Get back!

920
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:13,740
- Hey, get down.
- Drop the stick.

921
01:10:19,980 --> 01:10:22,580
Where you been, Lee?
I been on a roll, man!

922
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:36,660
What happened to you, man?

923
01:10:36,780 --> 01:10:39,220
What's that light in your mouth?

924
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:41,060
Oh, man,
this can't be good.

925
01:10:55,420 --> 01:10:57,660
Move!
Would you get out of my way?

926
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:11,420
What's wrong with you?

927
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:14,140
What happened to you, man?

928
01:11:36,780 --> 01:11:38,780
Why the hell you didn't
tell me you had a bomb in your mouth?

929
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:40,180
- I did!
- No, you didn't!

930
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:42,940
- I said "Mmm!"
- What the hell is "Mmm"?

931
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:49,620
Ricky Tan's still alive.
We have to get to the penthouse.

932
01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:51,300
Ricky Tan dead.

933
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:53,220
What you talking about?

934
01:11:59,860 --> 01:12:02,300
Lee. Go after Ricky, man.
I got this.

935
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:05,180
- Carter...
- Just go, man. I got this.

936
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:11,820
I'm not gonna hold back on you
this time just because you're a woman.

937
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:15,460
I'm gonna pretend you're a man.

938
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:18,220
A very beautiful man
with a perfect body...

939
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:20,220
who I'd like to take
to the movies.

940
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:31,420
You don't know nothing about this,
do you? Egyptian style, girl.

941
01:12:31,540 --> 01:12:34,860
You want some of this?
Come on.

942
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:36,380
Bring it on!

943
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:49,180
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

944
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:50,220
You need help.

945
01:12:53,060 --> 01:12:55,020
I didn't know
which side you were on.

946
01:12:56,460 --> 01:12:58,180
Well, now you know.

947
01:12:58,300 --> 01:12:59,460
What's wrong with you, woman?

948
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:06,820
Mmm, you smell good.

949
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:04,580
Thank you, Benjamin.
Thank you.

950
01:14:08,660 --> 01:14:12,460
We could have been a good couple.
We could have had something special.

951
01:14:12,580 --> 01:14:15,340
But you one crazy-ass bitch!

952
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:28,660
Americans love to gamble,
don't they, Mr. Reign?

953
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:30,820
I never gamble.

954
01:14:30,940 --> 01:14:33,380
Oh, I'm cutting our deal short.

955
01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:38,500
And my plates?

956
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:41,340
The plates stay with me. I'm sure
you won't have a problem with that.

957
01:14:43,820 --> 01:14:45,820
I enjoyed that little
story you told...

958
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:48,300
about the dragon
and the treasure.

959
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:50,940
My mother used to tell it
to me all the time.

960
01:14:52,580 --> 01:14:54,900
Do you know the moral
of that story?

961
01:14:55,020 --> 01:14:57,260
Greed will imprison us all.

962
01:15:01,420 --> 01:15:03,820
I hate that fortune-cookie shit.

963
01:15:17,780 --> 01:15:19,140
Just like your father.

964
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:23,380
I really did try
to help him, you know.

965
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:25,340
To share with him.

966
01:15:25,460 --> 01:15:27,860
To make your life better.

967
01:15:27,980 --> 01:15:30,060
But he was too weak.

968
01:15:30,180 --> 01:15:33,820
- Too afraid of change.
- Give me the plates.

969
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:37,300
- It's over.
- I don't think it's over.

970
01:15:37,420 --> 01:15:41,060
There are casinos
all over this country.

971
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:43,980
I can make you
a very rich man, Lee.

972
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:46,420
Don't make the same mistake
your father did.

973
01:15:46,540 --> 01:15:50,740
If you reach for that gun,
I'll kill you.

974
01:15:50,860 --> 01:15:53,980
Don't you remember?
I'm already dead.

975
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:01,020
Hey, Ricky.
How you doin'?

976
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:03,300
Lee, I see you got
everything under control.

977
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:06,300
I'm gonna go downstairs and...
Goddamn!

978
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:09,900
- What happened to Reign?
- Shall I tell you how your father died?

979
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:12,660
Hey, hey.
Wait one second, Lee.

980
01:16:12,780 --> 01:16:14,620
It ain't worth it, man.
He tryin' to trick you.

981
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:17,260
- Don't go too far, now.
- He never begged for his life...

982
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:19,540
- or tried to make a deal.
- Put the gun down.

983
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:23,060
All he asked me, just seconds
before I pulled the trigger...

984
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:25,860
was that I promise
not to kill you.

985
01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:29,020
Oh, he was so pathetic.

986
01:16:29,140 --> 01:16:32,620
Oh, hell, no. He went too far.
Shoot his ass right now, Lee!

987
01:16:32,740 --> 01:16:33,900
What are you gonna do?

988
01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:36,500
All you got to do is pull
that trigger back and bam!

989
01:16:36,620 --> 01:16:39,500
Are you going to spend the rest
of your life hiding like your father?

990
01:16:39,620 --> 01:16:42,100
Man, don't let him talk about
your daddy like that. Shoot him, Lee.

991
01:16:42,220 --> 01:16:44,460
- You can't do it, can you?
- Yes, hell, you can, Lee.

992
01:16:44,580 --> 01:16:47,100
- Ain't nobody up here but us.
- Just as I thought.

993
01:16:47,220 --> 01:16:48,780
He tryin' to punk you.
Shoot him!

994
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:51,780
If you ain't gonna shoot him,
kung fu his ass or something.

995
01:17:12,780 --> 01:17:15,620
Damn!
Good kick, Lee.

996
01:17:15,780 --> 01:17:17,620
It was an accident.

997
01:17:17,780 --> 01:17:20,900
That's OK. We'll just say
he tried to catch a cab.

998
01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:26,420
What's that in your...
Oh, hell, no.

999
01:17:26,580 --> 01:17:28,900
Lady, you listen
to me right now.

1000
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:31,860
- Put that bomb down and turn it off!
- Carter, we have to jump!

1001
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:33,700
You crazy. I ain't jumpin'.

1002
01:17:34,660 --> 01:17:36,660
- Use your jacket!
- Hey, turn that bomb off!

1003
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:39,660
Crazy-ass...

1004
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:54,620
That wasn't so bad.

1005
01:18:30,820 --> 01:18:33,780
I cannot believe I flew
10,000 miles for this shit.

1006
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:46,940
Detective Lee,
I hate to admit it...

1007
01:18:47,060 --> 01:18:50,420
but the United States Secret Service
is indebted to you.

1008
01:18:50,540 --> 01:18:52,580
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1009
01:18:52,740 --> 01:18:54,540
I'll see you on board.

1010
01:18:57,260 --> 01:18:59,060
I want to thank you too.

1011
01:19:06,620 --> 01:19:09,340
It was nice working with you.

1012
01:19:19,620 --> 01:19:21,820
I saw that.

1013
01:19:21,940 --> 01:19:24,900
You sly devil, you.
She kissed you, didn't she?

1014
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:29,140
You played it cool, too, walking away
and not looking back. I like that.

1015
01:19:29,260 --> 01:19:31,020
Yeah.
I'm a player.

1016
01:19:32,780 --> 01:19:35,340
- Where is she headed?
- She's going to New York.

1017
01:19:37,580 --> 01:19:41,260
- Is that your gate down there?
- Yep.

1018
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:43,740
Well, I'm this way.

1019
01:19:43,860 --> 01:19:46,100
- Guess that means good-bye.
- I guess so.

1020
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:49,300
Thank you, Carter.

1021
01:19:49,420 --> 01:19:51,380
Take good care
of yourself, Lee.

1022
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:57,900
- Oh, Carter.
- Yeah, Lee?

1023
01:19:58,020 --> 01:20:00,100
What's up?

1024
01:20:01,140 --> 01:20:03,220
There is something
I want you to have.

1025
01:20:05,580 --> 01:20:08,060
No. This is your daddy's badge.
I can't take that, man. No way.

1026
01:20:08,180 --> 01:20:10,660
It's OK. No.
Finally, I can let it go.

1027
01:20:12,620 --> 01:20:14,420
Thank you, man.
Hey.

1028
01:20:14,540 --> 01:20:17,620
You know what?
I got something for you too.

1029
01:20:21,580 --> 01:20:24,220
I got it at the tables this morning
at Caesar's. I'm still hot.

1030
01:20:24,340 --> 01:20:27,660
- I can't take this.
- Don't worry. I got a lot more.

1031
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:30,700
- Go ahead. Enjoy yourself.
- No, Carter. I can't have this.

1032
01:20:30,820 --> 01:20:33,140
Would you stop acting like a cop
for one second and live it up?

1033
01:20:33,260 --> 01:20:35,580
There got to be something
you want. Come on.

1034
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:37,620
Think about it.

1035
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:42,340
This is the final boarding call
for Flight 44 to La Guardia.

1036
01:20:42,460 --> 01:20:46,260
I always wanted to go to Madison
Square Garden, see the Knicks play.

1037
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:48,460
- New York City?
- First class.

1038
01:20:48,580 --> 01:20:50,860
- The Plaza Hotel?
- Maybe a little mu shu?

1039
01:20:50,980 --> 01:20:53,500
- Amen to that, brother.
- So, what do you say?

1040
01:20:53,620 --> 01:20:56,300
You know what, man?
I can use another vacation.

1041
01:21:10,140 --> 01:21:11,740
- Action!
- Let's go!

1042
01:21:37,420 --> 01:21:39,380
- You all right?
- Is he OK?

1043
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:42,900
- Jackie, you OK?
- Jackie always OK.

1044
01:21:43,020 --> 01:21:46,220
- Is this the kosher meal?
- Yes, sir. That's our kosher meal.

1045
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:48,620
- What's the name of it?
- Gefilte.

1046
01:21:48,740 --> 01:21:51,260
- Gefilte fish.
- "Filk" fish.

1047
01:21:51,380 --> 01:21:54,020
Lox and bagels.
It's my favorite.

1048
01:21:54,140 --> 01:21:56,260
- What's the name of this stuff?
- Gefilte fish.

1049
01:21:57,900 --> 01:21:59,980
"Gefilke" fish...
What's the name of this fish?

1050
01:22:03,020 --> 01:22:05,340
You know what this is?
What is it?

1051
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:07,700
- Gefilte fish.
- It's "filte" fish.

1052
01:22:07,820 --> 01:22:09,540
"Filte" fish. You want some
of my "filte" fish?

1053
01:22:09,660 --> 01:22:12,300
You want any of this...
What's the name of the fish?

1054
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:17,180
Gefilte fish!
All right. OK.

1055
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:19,740
- Gefilte fish. I love this stuff.
- I really don't.

1056
01:22:19,860 --> 01:22:22,060
You have black people
all over the world eatin' this.

1057
01:22:22,180 --> 01:22:25,740
Who eats lox and bagels?
I'll have some "gilte" fish.

1058
01:22:39,180 --> 01:22:41,420
Lady!
Jackie, kick it.

1059
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:43,780
OK.
Chris Tucker!

1060
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:47,500
- Jackie, kick it.
- Jackie again?

1061
01:22:47,620 --> 01:22:49,900
We'd love to see that.
Wouldn't we love to see that, Jackie?

1062
01:22:50,020 --> 01:22:52,540
Jackie, we'd like to see that.

1063
01:22:52,660 --> 01:22:54,660
Now, Jackie,
wouldn't we love to see that?

1064
01:22:54,780 --> 01:22:57,980
- His name is Lee, goddamn it.
- Lee, we would love to see that.

1065
01:22:58,100 --> 01:22:59,740
We would love to see that,
wouldn't we, Lee?

1066
01:22:59,860 --> 01:23:03,540
- There's gotta be something you want.
- I always want to go to Sw...

1067
01:23:03,660 --> 01:23:06,420
I always want to
go to Scra...

1068
01:23:06,540 --> 01:23:09,620
I always dreamed to
"Square Marden."

1069
01:23:09,740 --> 01:23:11,860
I always wanted to...

1070
01:23:14,220 --> 01:23:16,460
Now I'm gone.
Now I'm nervous.

1071
01:23:16,580 --> 01:23:19,980
Every "garden," I'm nervous.
Madison Square Garden.

1072
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:22,220
I always wanted to go
to this Madison...

1073
01:23:24,460 --> 01:23:26,740
- There are a lot of men chasing us.
- As well there should be.

1074
01:23:26,860 --> 01:23:28,860
'Cause you're a very good-looking man.
If I didn't have a girlfriend...

1075
01:23:28,980 --> 01:23:30,780
I'd take a run at you,
put you in a bubble bath...

1076
01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:33,500
and put some water wings on you
and spank your little bottom.

1077
01:23:33,620 --> 01:23:36,700
But listen.
Here's what we do, guys. Easy, easy.

1078
01:23:36,820 --> 01:23:39,700
Look, you're giggling at me.
I'll take you home and just punish you.

1079
01:23:39,820 --> 01:23:41,820
I need both of you.

1080
01:23:41,940 --> 01:23:45,620
You sly devil, you.
She kissed you, didn't she?

1081
01:23:45,740 --> 01:23:47,700
- Yeah.
- I like that.

1082
01:23:47,820 --> 01:23:49,540
Oh. Hold on.

1083
01:23:49,660 --> 01:23:53,380
- Who's calling?
- Hello?

1084
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:56,540
Hello?
I'm filming, man.

1085
01:23:56,660 --> 01:23:59,020
Call me back at 7:00.
I'm filming.

1086
01:23:59,140 --> 01:24:01,780
I'm looking Jackie Chan
dead in his eye. Call me back.

1087
01:24:01,900 --> 01:24:04,380
- Call me back.
- Are you a professional? We are filming.

1088
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:07,940
- You turn on your phone?
- No, you can't speak to Jackie Chan.

1089
01:24:08,060 --> 01:24:09,980
No! They want to
speak to you, Jackie.

1090
01:24:10,100 --> 01:24:11,900
- Hello?
- I'm sorry about this.

1091
01:24:12,020 --> 01:24:14,580
We are filming right now!

1092
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:18,140
You're sorry?
You wasted all our film!

1093
01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:20,340
Call me back later.
7:00.

1094
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:28,900
Damn! He ain't
gonna be in Rush Hour 3.

1095
01:24:28,900 --> 01:25:34,900
