1
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,900
All right, now.

2
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,100
I'm just heading to the fields, Duke.
I'll be back.

3
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,400
Clear!

4
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,700
Hey, Jerry, how's your mama?

5
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,200
Oh, yeah, it's a beautiful day.
Well, time to go to work.

6
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,600
Morning, Ben.

7
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,300
Thanks, Miles.

8
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,400
Let me know if you see Otis.

9
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,600
I'm staying out of that one.

10
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,800
- Okay, meeting's in five minutes.
- Okay, boss.

11
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,000
And I want everyone present.

12
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,400
Duke, have you seen Otis?

13
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,100
Nope, I haven't seen him.

14
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,800
Now where was I? Oh, oh, yeah.

15
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,400
The Jersey cows.

16
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,900
- Hey, Benny boy.
- Hi.

17
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,900
Hey, you seen Otis around?

18
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,400
Yes, I know exactly where Otis is.

19
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,500
You boys just steer clear
of Otis, all right?

20
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,600
Anything you say there, Ben.

21
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,000
We'll take a rain check
on the meeting, though.

22
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,000
- Yeah, rain check.
- Yeah, that. Check.

23
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Hey.

24
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,300
Hey, I stepped in something.
What's on my hoof?

25
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,400
Etta?

26
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,600
- Otis?
- Oh, Ben, don't worry.

27
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,100
I'm sure he's heading
for the meeting right now.

28
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,100
Okay, let go. Let go. I got it.

29
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,700
- He said, "Let go."
- All right. He's okay.

30
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,500
All right, boys, here's the dealio.

31
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,700
It's a little creation of mine
I like to call "hill surfing."

32
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,900
- Watch your hoof.
- I'll spot you. I'll spot you.

33
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,300
Are you sure this is safe, Otis?

34
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,300
Peck! Come on, safe?

35
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,500
It's completely safe!
Since when isn't surfing safe?

36
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,600
He's got a point.

37
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,500
Okay, salt lick.

38
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,500
- It's go time!
- I'll try it. I'm down.

39
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,900
- Shotgun!
- Piggyback!

40
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,300
Never! You are all gonna die.

41
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,000
- Freddy?
- Nothing.

42
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,900
Wait a second. Photo op.

43
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,200
Okay, get together!

44
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,700
- Hey, Pig?
- What?

45
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,800
- Where'd you get that apple?
- This apple?

46
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,200
Oh, well,
it originally was attached to this.

47
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,000
Otis?

48
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,800
What? What? What happened?

49
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,900
You know, it's times like this
when I really like to say...

50
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,300
Oh, caca!

51
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,900
You didn't do that!

52
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,900
Okay, okay! Look, this is bad enough!

53
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,500
Please, no one scream, "Tree!"

54
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,100
Tree!

55
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,900
Let's surf!

56
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,300
Hang on now, boys! Yeah! Hang hoof!

57
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,100
Otis? Are we supposed to
not yell, "Rock"?

58
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,400
We got a gusher!

59
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,600
Chicken farm!

60
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,200
Oh, I get it.
We can't yell "Tree" or "Rock",

61
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,000
but you get to yell, "Chicken farm."

62
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,500
Morning, everyone.

63
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,100
Okay, before we get started,
we have a birthday.

64
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,400
Everett the dog turned 13 today.

65
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,700
Boy, those dog years are rough, huh?

66
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,700
Also, remember it's...

67
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,000
Whassup?

68
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:40,100
Hey, Pop. Look, I know you're probably
looking for an explanation regarding

69
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,100
the exploded chicken on me,
and the sticky black... The oil stuff.

70
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,700
You are gonna love this! I'll tell you...
You the most, because

71
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,900
you, my friend, are a laugher.
And every...

72
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,300
- Didn't we all know that? Right?
- Just take a seat.

73
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,600
I'll... I'll take a seat.

74
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,300
Cool.

75
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,300
Oh, sorry about that.

76
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,600
Little tight.

77
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,300
As I was saying,

78
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,800
remember tonight at the hoedown,
it's free cider night.

79
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,500
Hey. Hey, Pig,
I think there's a dead bee in your nostril.

80
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,100
That's not dead.

81
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,200
Okay, the first matter at hand:
gray market goods.

82
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,600
As if I needed to say it again.

83
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,600
The purchase of human articles
from the gopher underground

84
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,600
is strictly prohibited.

85
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,800
<i>Hello, Moto!</i>

86
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,700
Hey, Otis.
Yeah, listen, I think your Nikes are...

87
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,600
Yeah, this really isn't the best time.

88
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:48,600
Yeah, this really isn't the best time.

89
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,100
Hang on a second. Frankie, come here.
Frankie, come here.

90
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,300
No, I'm not... Come here. I'm not
gonna hurt you. Frankie, come here.

91
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,400
<i>I told you never to do that again,</i>
<i>as long as I live!</i>

92
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,500
<i>Now, put it over there! Now!</i>

93
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,300
Sorry about that. Frankie's out of hand.

94
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,500
Oh, the Nikes. What's the make again?

95
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:07,400
Yeah. Yeah, I really should go,
Mr. Jordan Air.

96
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,800
Wrong number.

97
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,600
Thank you.

98
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,600
Second item.

99
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,500
Lest I remind you, this is coyote season.

100
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,500
That's right.

101
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,400
These are ruthless
and desperate creatures.

102
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,000
Rule number one: stay in groups.

103
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:30,200
Rule number two: stay inside
the perimeter of the fence at all times.

104
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,700
And number three: be careful out there.

105
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,600
Okay, let's hit it.

106
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,900
And leaving quickly. Walking out.
Walking out. Step, step, step wider...

107
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,000
Otis, why don't you stick around
for a minute?

108
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,600
He's scary. Bye.

109
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,200
Okay, Miles. What do you think?

110
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,000
I think you're lucky.

111
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,100
Most cows only have four hooves,

112
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,500
but you're gonna have an extra one
right up your...

113
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,600
Okay, that's nice. Dad!

114
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,100
- Sit.
- And I'm sitting.

115
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,800
Okay. First off,

116
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,000
I don't even want to know
who was on the other end of that phone.

117
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,900
- It was the gophers, wasn't it?
- Well, I...

118
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,900
No, I don't want to know.
Was it the gophers?

119
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,900
- Here's...
- No, don't. I don't want to know.

120
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,700
Why do you do this to me?
How do you think that makes me look?

121
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,300
So this... This is about you?

122
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,600
Where were you this morning, Otis?

123
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,000
I was having a little fun.
I mean, you should try it.

124
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,300
It starts with a smile,
then slowly builds and...

125
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,000
You promised to help me
with the brush around the fence.

126
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,900
You know it's coyote season.

127
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:40,800
Geez, coyotes. I don't get it.
What's the big deal? They're coyotes.

128
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:45,000
Them tiny, us big!
What are they gonna do?

129
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,400
You have a lot to learn.

130
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,600
And you know what,
I don't get the fence thing.

131
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,300
Really, it can't keep them out.

132
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,400
That fence defines our space.

133
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,600
And as long as I'm still kicking,

134
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,800
no animal will be harmed
inside that fence.

135
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,900
Okay, that's what you do. You.

136
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,500
Okay, if you're trying to groom me
to be the big leader,

137
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,600
just give it up. It's not me, Pop.

138
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,600
I mean, if I were in charge,
things would be different.

139
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,800
Every animal for himself.
That's the way it should be.

140
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,100
Otis.

141
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,500
A strong man stands up for himself.

142
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,000
A stronger man stands up for others.

143
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,200
Oh, shoot. You know, I forgot my pen.

144
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,800
- And your shift tonight?
- I'll be there.

145
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,300
Otis, you're gonna have to
grow up one day.

146
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,900
You'll never be happy
if you spend all your time goofing off.

147
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,200
No? Just watch me.

148
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,300
Manabunga!

149
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,600
Freddy, is this great or what?

150
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,600
Oh, yeah.
I could just eat your head right off!

151
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:57,800
I mean... You know, it's fun up here.

152
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,300
Pip?

153
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,000
I'd go with the wood on this one.

154
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,500
That's what I'm talking about!
Sweet mama!

155
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,100
Hey, there's animals over there!

156
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,000
Nice shoes.

157
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:46,100
<i>Oh, doctor!</i>
<i>What a game we have here today!</i>

158
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,600
Yeah!

159
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,800
<i>He got the ball on the 30.</i>
<i>He's down on the 20. Lifts it up...</i>

160
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,300
<i>It's a touchdown!</i>

161
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,500
Yeah!

162
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,300
Bacon!

163
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,700
Hamburger!

164
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,400
Chorizo!

165
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,900
- Filet!
- What are you doing?

166
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,700
I'm naming the kinds of cuts of meat
to the animal I'm jumping on.

167
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,600
Machaca!

168
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,800
Pork chops!

169
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,800
Rump roast!

170
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,600
You know what?
You don't need to be doing this.

171
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,100
Oaty-oaty! Oaty-oaty!

172
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,900
Hi, Oaty.

173
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,600
Hey, Maddie. Looking good over there.

174
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,900
Chubba Face, you crazy cow.

175
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,200
Say, "I'm smooshy."

176
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,900
I am smooshy.

177
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,000
Okay, now you.

178
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,100
Say, "Boy, is it windy."

179
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,500
Boy, is it windy.

180
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,500
My turn, my turn.

181
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,200
- Okay, chick. Just run along now.
- Bye, Oaty.

182
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,000
All righty.

183
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,400
Hey, who is she?

184
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,300
They just showed up.
Farmer took them in.

185
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,100
Thank you, Farmer.

186
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,300
Yeah, something happened
with their herd.

187
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,400
They're the only two that made it.

188
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,100
She needs a friend.

189
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,600
Wait, wait, wait!

190
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,000
Excuse me, but I couldn't help
notice you over there.

191
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,600
Hey! Oh, look at you. You're all...

192
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,500
- Pregnant?
- Yeah, sure. I mean...

193
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,800
Really? 'Cause, I mean,
it isn't that noticeable, you know.

194
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,500
I mean, especially when you
stand straight on,

195
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,100
and you don't look at it.

196
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,000
You know, when you turn to the side,
it gets a little lumpy.

197
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,300
I mean glowy. Glowy. It's a glow.

198
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,000
I'm... I'm Otis.

199
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,000
Back off, Daisy.
There's an "L" on that boy's forehead.

200
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,600
No, that's just me,
the contortion mouse.

201
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,400
C!

202
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,600
X!

203
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,700
N!

204
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,600
- Q!
- Oh, man, you're killing me, dude.

205
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,000
Look, I just wanted to welcome you
to the barnyard.

206
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,900
I'm sure that you and your...

207
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,600
Not looking. The key word, "not".

208
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,200
Work with me. Not looking.

209
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,600
This is my friend, Bessy.

210
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,300
Yeah, she's a cupcake.

211
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,100
- It was nice to meet you, Otis.
- Yeah, too you.

212
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,300
You know what? Switch those.

213
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,200
Oh, boy.

214
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,000
There's nothing for you there,
but I kind of like her friend.

215
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,100
He's out!

216
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,400
All clear! Sweet!

217
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,000
<i>Now, every heifer, every cow</i>
<i>Hold tight to your udders now</i>

218
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
<i>Farmer Brown is bedding down</i>
<i>Let's turn this barn into funky town</i>

219
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,600
<i>Chickens on the left</i>
<i>Dance with your neighbor</i>

220
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:36,700
<i>Hogs, don't slobber on the pool table</i>

221
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,100
<i>Hogs, don't slobber on the pool table</i>

222
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:42,100
<i>Try to go easy on the manure</i>
<i>It's a dance floor, not a sewer</i>

223
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,600
<i>Here we go, do-si-do</i>
<i>Here we go, do-si-do</i>

224
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,900
Put this thing on hot!

225
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,300
<i>Better hold on tight</i>
<i>When we go hitting the hay</i>

226
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,800
<i>You better hold on tight and pray</i>

227
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,500
<i>You better hold on tight</i>
<i>When we go hitting the hay</i>

228
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,600
<i>Darling, you better run</i>
<i>'Cause I won't hold back them horses</i>

229
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,100
<i>Hitting the hay</i>
<i>We'll go hitting the hay</i>

230
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,400
<i>We will rumble and tumble</i>
<i>Night and day</i>

231
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,000
<i>Here we go again</i>
<i>Come grab your friend</i>

232
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,700
<i>Shake him up, shake him down</i>
<i>Try to get a good blend</i>

233
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,000
<i>Here we go, do-si-do</i>
<i>Here we go</i>

234
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,700
- <i>First you hold on tight</i>
- <i>Hold on tight</i>

235
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,300
- <i>Then you dance all night</i>
- <i>Dance all night</i>

236
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,300
<i>Hit the hay!</i>

237
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,900
<i>Better hold on tight</i>
<i>When we go hitting the hay</i>

238
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,100
<i>You better hold on tight and pray</i>

239
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,800
<i>You better hold on tight</i>
<i>When we go hitting the hay</i>

240
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,800
<i>Hitting the hay</i>
<i>We'll go hitting the hay</i>

241
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,100
<i>We will rumble and tumble</i>
<i>Night and day</i>

242
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
<i>We'll go hitting the hay</i>
<i>We'll go hitting the hay</i>

243
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,600
<i>With our backsides shaking</i>
<i>We'll go hitting the hay</i>

244
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,500
Wow! This is amazing.

245
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,700
What you looking at?

246
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,400
What? You want some of this?

247
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,200
Oh, yeah, I didn't think so.

248
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,900
Sit right here, honey.

249
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,000
The flowers are beautiful.

250
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,400
See? On time, just like I...

251
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,400
Right.

252
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,500
Cramp! That's a cramp!

253
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,000
Oh, it's cramping!

254
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,000
And release.

255
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,400
- Hello, Son.
- Dad,

256
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,900
I've been thinking,

257
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,400
and I'm willing to accept your apology.

258
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,500
- Really?
- Sure. I mean, it's only right. I mean...

259
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,000
Okay.

260
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,500
I don't mean to let you down, Pop.
I'm just out trying to have some fun.

261
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,400
It's a beautiful night.

262
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,500
I remember when I used to
sit out here with your sister.

263
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,600
- I don't have a sister.
- Oh, yeah.

264
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,900
That was you, wasn't it?

265
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,400
Thank you, all right.

266
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,700
So, are we okay?

267
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,000
- We're okay.
- Great.

268
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,300
See, 'cause I wanted
to ask you something.

269
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,100
My friends are all going
to the barn tonight,

270
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,300
and not that it matters either way to me,

271
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,400
but evidently, I'm needed.

272
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,600
I'm a sort of an integral part
of a musical number.

273
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,500
Yeah, I tried to tell them no, you know?
But they were just so...

274
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,100
I told them, "My dad's not gonna
wanna cover my shift.

275
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:35,000
"I mean, it's my shift, not his.
It isn't his!" You know?

276
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:38,000
"I don't want to be selfish.
What's mine is mine, and..."

277
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,900
What do you think?

278
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,800
Otis...

279
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,900
I never thought
I was gonna amount to much.

280
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,800
I certainly didn't think
I'd be in charge of anything.

281
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,600
But that all changed one day.

282
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,400
It was the day you showed up.

283
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,000
I head out into the meadow

284
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,900
and I see this little baby calf all alone,

285
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,000
stumbling around.

286
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,900
You know,
before you became a nightmare.

287
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,700
Well, I took you home that night,

288
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,200
and I know it doesn't sound possible,

289
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,400
but I looked up into the sky

290
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,000
and I would have swore

291
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,300
I saw the stars dance.

292
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,800
At that moment,
I knew my place was here,

293
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,100
taking care of things.

294
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,000
I guess you helped me realize that.

295
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,500
I love you, Son.

296
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,900
- You still want to go, don't you?
- Yeah, I really do.

297
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,600
Not that your stuff... You know, the stuff
you're saying isn't nifty and everything...

298
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,100
No one says "nifty".

299
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,900
I say "nifty." I do, and sometimes
even "swifty." I'll say that.

300
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,400
Very impressive.

301
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,500
Go ahead, have fun. I'll cover your shift.

302
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,400
Thanks, Pop. You're the best.

303
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,900
- Otis?
- Yeah?

304
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,600
Be the stronger man.

305
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,500
Yeah. Yeah, that's
that saying thing, right?

306
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,200
"A strong man stands up for himself.

307
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,300
"A stronger man can
bridge the gap between..."

308
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,300
Got it locked in the vault.

309
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,000
See? I learn.

310
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,200
<i>Mr. Boombastic</i>

311
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,400
<i>What you want is a boombastic</i>
<i>Romantic, fantastic lover</i>

312
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:34,900
<i>She call me Mr. Boombastic</i>
<i>Say me fantastic</i>

313
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,900
<i>Touch me in me back</i>
<i>She says I'm Mr. Romantic</i>

314
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,700
<i>Call me fantastic</i>

315
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,500
<i>Touch me in me back</i>
<i>She says I'm Mr. Ro...</i>

316
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,400
<i>Smooth</i>

317
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,500
Who's here? Moo! It's me! Moo!

318
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,500
Whassup? Milk me!

319
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,800
Hey, babe.

320
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,900
My barn. That's right, my barn.

321
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
You're late. Come on.

322
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,200
He's a real winner, that one.

323
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,700
Oh, stop. I think he's kind of cute.

324
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,100
<i>Lay down in my Jacuzzi</i>
<i>and get some bubble bath</i>

326
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,800
<i>And we will mmm-mmm</i>
<i>And have some sweet pillow talk</i>

328
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:25,600
Give it up for the one and only,
Biggy Cheese!

329
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,200
We're gonna have some fun
tonight, y'all.

330
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,800
Hey, Buck.
Get your hooves off the stage.

331
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,000
You ain't in show business.

332
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,300
What, were you raised in a barn?

333
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,900
Well, you're a good horse. Okay...

334
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,900
What you looking at, Turkey?

335
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,500
Somebody pass me
the cranberry sauce.

336
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,900
Dead turkey walking.

337
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,300
We all gonna die,
but we don't know the date.

338
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,600
We know your date, Thanksgiving!

339
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,700
Okay, to kick things off tonight,
I got a special treat.

340
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,600
Back by popular demand.

341
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,000
Ladies, this one's for you.

342
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,800
Our own Otis and the Crew!

343
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,400
<i>Well, down on the farm</i>

344
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,000
<i>Where they all ask for you</i>

345
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,400
Parties all hours of the night.

346
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,700
What is that farmer up to?
You know what?

347
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,200
- I'm gonna call someone.
- Oh, leave him be.

348
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,200
Well, I'll just call whoever I want,
whenever I want to.

349
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,800
That's exactly what I'll do.

350
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,800
Because I know
what a rave is, Mr. Lump.

351
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,100
"I'm going to sit and watch TV
and be a lump."

352
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:01,700
Okay, Mr. Lumpy. It's just not right.

353
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,200
<i>They all ask for you</i>

354
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,900
<i>They all ask for you</i>

355
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,900
<i>Down on the farm</i>

356
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:21,300
<i>They all ask for you</i>

357
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,000
I'll check it.

358
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,800
It's all right. Calm down.
It's just the pizza guy.

359
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,300
I'm on it.

360
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,900
Watch out. I got it. I got it.

361
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,400
Pizza, pizza, pizza.

362
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,200
Thanks. You want change?

363
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,500
No, keep it.

364
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,200
So, you really ordered a lot of pizzas.

365
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,200
Well, yes.
We're having a big human party.

366
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,000
Just a party. A big one.

367
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:11,300
With us celebrating our humanness.

368
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,000
- Dude, I love parties! Can I...
- No.

369
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,100
Okay. Well, then, I'll see you.

370
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,400
Ouch!

371
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,100
My arm fell off.

372
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,300
My fake arm, I mean.

373
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,700
Wow, I am so sorry about that.

374
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,200
- Do you need any help?
- No, I don't like help.

375
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,500
It's just against my religion.
I'm a Nohelpian.

376
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,500
Cool, I'm a Lutheran.

377
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,300
What about this?

378
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,700
You know what? You keep it.
It's dirty now.

379
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,600
Really? All right.

380
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,900
Dude, I got a arm!

381
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,800
Yeah! Righteous!

382
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:25,300
<i>Well, I won't back down</i>

383
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,500
<i>No, I won't back down</i>

384
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,600
<i>You can stand me up</i>
<i>at the gates of hell</i>

385
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,700
<i>But I won't back down</i>

386
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,100
<i>Gonna stand my ground</i>

387
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:46,200
<i>Won't be turned around</i>

388
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,900
<i>And I'll keep this world</i>
<i>from dragging me down</i>

389
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:54,100
<i>Gonna stand my ground</i>

390
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,600
Good evening, ladies.

391
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,800
Sorry to call on you
so late in the evening,

392
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,900
but we did have a previous engagement.

393
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,100
Now, we're gonna take six of you.

394
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,000
Anyone makes a sound,
we don't mind the extra company.

395
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,200
Boys, take your pick.

396
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,000
You won't be taking any hens tonight.

397
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,400
And you're gonna stop us?

398
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,900
Is that what's gonna happen?
Are you gonna stop us, hen?

399
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,100
How are you gonna do that?

400
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,900
No, he is.

401
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,300
Ben. How are you, Ben?

402
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,900
We would've said hello,
had we seen you.

403
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,700
Put the hen down, Dag.

404
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,500
Sure, Ben. Whatever you say.

405
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,500
We're just doing a little courting,
that's all.

406
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,000
You know how much we like the hens.

407
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,900
You know me, ladykiller.

408
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,700
You have us
at a bit of a disadvantage here, Ben.

409
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,700
There's six of us,

410
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,600
and only one old, fat you.

411
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,000
Oh, baby! Party time!

412
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,500
Otis!

413
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,100
Otis!

414
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,200
Otis! Otis!

415
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,200
It's Ben.

416
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,100
Oh, no. No, no.

417
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,300
Yeah. You hang on there, buddy.

418
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,000
All right now, Otis. Just lift.

419
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Ten and two. Ten and two.

420
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,900
Not like that. Now lift, and two.

421
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,300
You dog!

422
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,600
Come here, fisherman.

423
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,900
What do we do now? Who's gonna
protect us from the coyotes?

424
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,100
Anybody got a pistol?

425
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,100
Order, here! Hey, am I bothering you?

426
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,100
Let's get this meeting started.

427
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,600
- Duke, who's gonna run the meeting?
- That's what the meeting's about.

428
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,300
The meeting's about
finding someone to run the meeting?

429
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,800
Is that a good idea?

430
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,200
We should take a meeting about it.

431
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,500
Someone has to do this.
We don't have Ben.

432
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,300
Therefore, I would like
to nominate myself.

433
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,300
Dogs are... Listen to me.

434
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,500
Dogs are watchful,
they're loyal, and very protective.

435
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,900
And they lick themselves.

436
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,400
I don't want a leader who licks himself.

437
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,700
- Me, neither.
- That's nasty.

438
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,800
I can't even reach mine.

439
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,200
I don't do that.

440
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,400
Anymore.

441
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,700
One time, I was bored,
lonely, and a little snackish.

442
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,700
Yeah, I saw you drink
out of a toilet once.

443
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:20,000
- Hey, you drink potty water.
- You drink potty water!

444
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:24,200
My bowl was empty, my friend.
Come on, we're getting off track here.

445
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,600
Duke, with all respect,
I think there are certain traits

446
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,000
that would make you unqualified
to be leader.

447
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,400
Yeah, such as?

448
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,300
Your point?

449
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,600
Hey, come on, I do that for fun,

450
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,400
not 'cause I have to. Go on!

451
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:04,100
So, big deal. I fetch balls.
One little flaw.

452
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,700
This doesn't mean anything.

453
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:24,000
All right, all right, let's take a vote.
Come on, let's take a vote here.

454
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,700
All those in favor
of me being the new leader.

455
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,500
Those opposed?

456
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,000
- Can you see my hand?
- Listen now, listen up.

457
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,800
You all know that Ben always
intended for Otis to take his place.

458
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,600
All right, Otis is in charge.

459
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,800
I second that motion. Sweet!

460
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,800
Here we go.

461
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,800
Try and catch me.

462
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,200
Stay in line.

463
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,500
Maddie, we don't want to lose you.

464
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,300
Oh, I think that would be just fine.

465
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,700
Oaty-oaty! Hey, Oaty!

466
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:31,000
Hey, Maddie, now really isn't a good...

467
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:34,600
What are you doing?
Would you stop? Come on.

468
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,100
Hey, hey, hey, guys, guys...

469
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,400
- Oh, goodness gracious.
- What is it? What is it?

470
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,400
Otis, it's a madhouse! Isn't it just great?

471
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,800
You got hit with a soccer ball.

472
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,400
I thought I'd be the first
to congratulate you, Otis.

473
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,800
- You're in charge now.
- I'm what?

474
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,400
Miles, I am not in charge, okay?

475
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,900
I don't do "In charge".

476
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,900
- This is not my responsibility.
- I hear you.

477
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,500
But you were elected fair and square.

478
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,100
Congratulations, boss.

479
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,200
Hey!

480
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,200
Have you all lost your mind?

481
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,200
It's daylight.
The Farmer's gonna be back.

482
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,500
This is so off limits.

483
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,600
Come on, Otis,

484
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,000
I know your weak spot.

485
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,600
Wild Mike!

486
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,200
- What?
- Wild Mike.

487
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,000
Wild Mike. Wild Mike.

488
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,400
- Wild Mike.
- I'm not doing this, okay?

489
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,900
- There's no way this is happening.
- Wild Mike. Wild Mike.

490
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,800
- Everybody just get back to your...
- Wild Mike. Wild Mike.

491
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,500
- Return to your designated quadrants.
- Wild Mike. Wild Mike.

492
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,400
Wild Mike! Wild Mike!

493
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,100
- This is ridiculous!
- Wild Mike!

494
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:31,500
I'm not gonna dance
just because you're getting Wild Mike.

495
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,500
- Pip, help me out here.
- Wild Mike. Wild Mike.

496
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:37,900
You can't fight it, Otis.
You're a born party animal.

497
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,900
Wild Mike! Wild Mike! Wild Mike!

498
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,100
Wild Mike! Wild Mike! Wild Mike!

499
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,300
Let's boogie!

500
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,000
<i>We're heading for the West</i>
<i>Not heading for the East</i>

501
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:03,200
<i>We're gonna live our dream</i>
<i>'Cause we're wild and free</i>

502
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,800
Look at that freaky thing.

503
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,600
What kind of animal is that?

504
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:09,200
I don't know, but he sure can dance.

505
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:26,500
I say, let's kill it.
Give me that piece of wood over there.

506
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,800
Sweet legs! Get the sweet legs!
I got the sweet legs!

507
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,200
Moo?

508
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,800
What did you do that for?

509
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,400
What else was I gonna do? He saw you.

510
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,300
You could have killed him!

511
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,300
I got a pulse.

512
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:44,100
Oh, this is bad. This is bad.
This is so bad.

513
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,400
Baaad.

514
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:49,400
Everybody, just calm down.
Just calm down, all right?

515
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,600
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

516
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
What?

517
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,200
Come on. You're our leader. Lead us.

518
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,400
That does not apply to this.

519
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,300
This is a totally, situationally
different suspect.

520
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,100
Hey, whoa, no.

521
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,900
- We gotta ditch the body.
- Stop it!

522
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,000
He knows too much.
We gotta take care of him.

523
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,500
- We gotta whack him.
- There will be no whacking, okay?

524
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,700
The Farmer's a good guy.
He's been good to us.

525
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,900
He's a vegan, God bless him.

526
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:23,100
And what is a vegan, again?

527
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,100
I know this one.

528
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,500
No, I got it. It means
you can't eat anything with a face.

529
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,200
No, no, no, that's a vegetarian.

530
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,200
Vegetarians have to eat
in the dark, right?

531
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,800
That's a vampire. Come on.

532
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
You can't eat cheese?

533
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:36,500
It's not just cheese.
Vegans can't have any dairy products.

534
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,200
- Cake?
- Cake has egg products.

535
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,700
But you can't have any dairy.

536
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:44,100
No dairy? I love dairy.
Does that mean I can't be a vegan?

537
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,700
I love the smell of bacon.
There, I said it.

538
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,000
Would you not do that?

539
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,600
It's not like we have a lot of options.

540
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:58,000
Boy, that's a doozy.
That thing's bigger than me.

541
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,900
Push it.

542
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:01,900
- He wakes up, you got my back, right?
- Yeah.

543
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,300
Come on. Come on.

544
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:14,600
Okay, watch this. Off his nose,
on the belly, on the floor. Check it.

545
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,400
Book.

546
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,800
Okay, now.
He was sitting here, he was reading.

547
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,000
- Something fell on his head, and...
- I got it.

548
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,100
Too light.
Couldn't cause a bump like that.

549
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,600
I bet it could.

550
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,900
Would you cut it out?
We need something bigger.

551
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,600
Can I have the apple?

552
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,600
What's with the look?

553
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,900
He's buying it.

554
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,000
He's not buying it.

555
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,000
He's buying it.

556
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,400
He's not buying it.

557
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,700
No, he's buying it.

558
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:44,000
Will you stop doing that?

559
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:47,900
Well, unless you get him a blindfold,
I'm going to kick him!

560
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,900
Okay, let's go.

561
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,900
There. See? Good as new.

562
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:13,100
I'll tell you,
this being in charge thing isn't so tough.

563
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:16,800
You know what I'm talking about?
You know what I'm talking about. Yeah.

564
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:30,900
Yeah, hi. Hey, there.
Having a good day? Yeah.

565
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:34,900
So, this was Otis's idea?

566
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,800
Oh, yeah.
We're like the second line of defense.

567
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:42,500
We see or hear anything suspicious,
and I just signal Otis with a crow.

568
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,800
And I've really been
working on it. Listen.

569
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,500
Well, you know, in the moment,
it'll be really strong.

570
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,100
But for now, we just stand watch.

571
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:01,100
Yeah, watch.

572
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,400
Come and get it!

573
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,900
Freddy, you okay?

574
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,900
Boneless white meat!
What? I'm not hungry!

575
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:21,100
I mean, I don't wanna eat anyone...
Thing... You...

576
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:23,400
What happened? What? What? What?

577
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:32,200
Okay, quick little once
around the barnyard, then, hello, party!

578
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,500
Hey, look at this.
It's our new inside connection.

579
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,600
Congrats, Otis.

580
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,600
Oh, will you look at that?

581
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:53,000
Don't wake up the cow.

582
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,700
That's called cowtipping.

583
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,500
Oh, that so steams me!

584
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,900
Man, I wish I could get
a hold of that little... I would...

585
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,100
Hey, I'm in charge, right?

586
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:19,500
Oh, we are so talking.
Are we not talking?

587
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,900
- Talking the talk and walking the walk.
- Walkie-talkie, huh?

588
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,700
Let's go.

589
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:27,300
Then I said, "That's called cowtipping."

590
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:38,500
I hear music over there again.
Do you hear music?

591
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,000
That farmer's out of control.

592
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,400
We should call someone.
We should call someone.

593
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:48,000
- I smell buttermilk.
- Shut up! Shut up!

594
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,700
- What's that smell?
- Stop it! Stop it!

595
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,400
Randall, there is a cow outside.

596
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:08,900
This is a cow farm.
You're gonna find cows outside.

597
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,700
No, I mean right outside.

598
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:15,300
Right outside this house,
looming like a ghost. Like a reaper.

599
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,300
No, cows don't like houses much.

600
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:22,700
They prefer it out in the meadow,
where they can get a graze on.

601
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:26,800
Nathan Randall the Third,
I am not crazy.

602
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,700
I am medicated
for a chemical imbalance.

603
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,700
Don't you sit there
and think that I am crazy.

604
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:38,100
Your mind's gone, woman.

605
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:40,700
Where'd it go? I don't know.

606
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:42,400
It's gone.

607
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:49,000
- Oh geez, you're on my foot again.
- Sorry.

608
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,300
This is so sweet.
This is so wicked sweet.

609
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,100
I love the new you, Otis.

610
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:56,400
Okay, Igg,
you remember how to do this?

611
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,900
- Oh, he remembers.
- I remember.

612
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,700
- Yeah, he remembers.
- He's remembering.

613
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:00,800
Right now.

614
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:19,100
Well, pinch me, I'm dreaming.
Here is a first.

615
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:21,400
Otis joining us on a joyride.

616
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:25,700
- That's the animal sin of sins, huh?
- "Sin of sins," I like that.

617
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,900
Hey, old Bud. Bud, you bring the stuff?

618
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:30,500
It's right here.

619
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:33,100
- Show it. Show it.
- It's right here.

620
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,400
- Show it.
- It's right here.

621
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,000
- Show it.
- It's right there.

622
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:41,100
We're rebels! We're rebels!

623
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:42,700
We're the wildest!

624
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:44,700
There they are.

625
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:52,200
- Too bad we can't go in there.
- Yeah.

626
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,800
Breaks my heart.

627
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,100
Now remember, honey, I told you,

628
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,800
we can't be staying out this late
on a school night.

629
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,500
"We can't be staying out late."

630
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,300
Whatever. I'll do what I want.

631
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:18,500
Do what I want, when I want,
'cause I want to do it.

632
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:24,400
You've come to the wrong place.

633
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:34,300
- What is that?
- I'm lactose intolerant.

634
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:37,100
- Oh, man.
- Here we go. I know.

635
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,600
- One, two...
- Yeah.

636
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:40,700
Two, yeah.

637
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,400
Moo!

638
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:50,100
That's called boytipping!

639
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,600
- Let's get out of here!
- Come on, move it!

640
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,300
Let me out!

641
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:02,100
Okay, go!

642
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,200
Never go to meadows.
Never go to meadows.

643
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,200
Never go to meadows.
Never go to meadows.

644
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,900
Treat cows nicely.

645
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:16,000
Okay, no more Red Bull.

646
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:25,100
Put crowns on our heads,
'cause we are the kings!

647
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,700
Did you see his face?

648
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:37,900
- Price...
- Less.

649
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:38,800
- Price...
- Less.

650
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:39,900
- Pr...
- Ice...

651
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Less.

652
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:46,500
A toast! To a new world order.

653
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,800
We are calling the shots now!

654
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,200
- Yeah, it's all about us now.
- You've got that right, Otis.

655
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,500
Nothing can touch us.

656
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,400
Oh, man! Oh, man!

657
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,100
- Oh, man!
- Man, oh, man!

658
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:00,900
Let me out! You gotta let me out!

659
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,300
<i>Pull over to the side of the road.</i>

660
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,200
Oh, no, they're talking to us now.

661
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,300
Pull over! You gotta pull over!

662
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:10,000
We can't pull over!

663
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:11,400
Hang on!

664
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,600
What could be worse than this?

665
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,500
What we got here
is probably some teenagers

666
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:20,100
going out for a joyride
in their mom's car.

667
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,300
Yeah, we'll shake them up a bit,
send them home. You know kids.

668
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:26,400
Nothing a little strip search
won't cure, yeah.

669
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,200
Is this thing still on?

670
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,800
Is that a camera?

671
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,200
- This is it. Goodbye.
- They're taping <i>Cops.</i>

672
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:35,900
Mommy! Mooo-mmy!

673
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:39,800
Hey, relax. We can lose them.
I mean, it's just a car, right?

674
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:42,800
It's a chopper! It's a chopper!

675
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,100
We're gonna die!

676
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:48,700
<i>We interrupt this program with</i>
<i>a breaking news story. Police are in...</i>

677
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:51,700
Would you look at that?
The world is going crazy.

678
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:56,000
These kids get all hopped up on
Diet Coke and Jolly Ranchers and just...

679
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:57,800
That's our car!

680
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:03,800
That was a hoof.
There's a cow in our car! That is a hoof!

681
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,600
Yes, this is Nora Beady.

682
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,500
What do you mean, "What now?"

683
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:18,400
My car is on TV,
and I think there's a cow in it.

684
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:22,300
And I saw a cow outside my window.
I think they may be linked.

685
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:25,700
Don't think I can't call again, Gary.

686
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:31,400
Oh, that's nice. Good.

687
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:35,900
They're gonna catch us
and they're gonna dissect us.

688
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:39,000
We are ditching out!

689
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:52,500
Two all-beef patties, that's our future!

690
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,000
Out! Run!

691
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:00,000
- Run!
- Stop touching me!

692
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
They're making a run for it. Let's go.
Come on.

693
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:06,900
<i>This is Gray Badger in Chopper 219.</i>
<i>We've got suspects in sight.</i>

694
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,100
I'm chafing!

695
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,300
Okay. Hurry up, fellows.
They're right over there.

696
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:12,400
Oh, milk me!

697
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:13,500
Okay, here we go! Here we go!

698
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,600
Milk me!

699
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:16,000
Geez, these guys are big.

700
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,200
I see them over there.

701
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,700
Cut it right!

702
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,600
We got them!

703
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:46,000
Could you guys believe that?
Did you guys see me?

704
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,400
Me, I am fearless, baby.

705
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,500
- Oh, yeah, fear...
- Less.

706
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:52,900
I think I rolled over my foot.

707
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:56,100
We left it the same way we found it.

708
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:05,200
Okay, toodle-oo, Otis.
Same time tomorrow night?

709
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:09,000
Hey, guys, can you imagine
Ben doing something like that?

710
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,300
- No way. No way.
- We'd be in trouble.

711
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:13,700
- Trou...
- Ble.

712
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:37,500
Okay, explain to me exactly
why are we doing this?

713
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:39,500
Because it's what my dad would do.

714
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,900
Why don't you just go have fun,
all right? I can do this.

715
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:44,600
No way. We're homeboys.
I'm here with you.

716
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:46,000
Really, it's all right.

717
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:48,100
Okay, I tried! Later, dude.

718
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:51,100
I'll bring you back a drink or something.
Be back.

719
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:00,600
Come on back, I'm right here.

720
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:02,200
Mind if I join you?

721
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:06,300
No. I mean, sure. I no mind you...

722
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,000
Geez, I can't even talk to you!

723
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:11,200
Hang on a second.

724
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,200
Here. You know, just let me...

725
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,900
No, I can still sit on my own, I think.

726
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:23,800
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh, the baby's coming!

727
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:24,800
What?

728
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:27,300
I made you jump.

729
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:30,800
Nice. Nice. Thank you.
I about swallowed my cud.

730
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:36,100
- It's beautiful, isn't it?
- My cud?

731
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:40,700
- The night.
- Yeah, that, too. Yeah, it's nice.

732
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,800
My dad had a thing about stars.

733
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:49,800
- Tell me, what was he like?
- My pop?

734
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:53,200
He was amazing.
Bigger than life, you know?

735
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,600
Funny, we're not even related.

736
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:58,500
He found me and he took me in.

737
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:03,500
I never thought about it before,
but everything he did was for me.

738
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:06,400
He's the only family I've ever known.

739
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:11,400
The last time we talked,
he told me that the night he found me

740
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:16,300
he looked up into the sky
and he said that the stars...

741
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,800
God, I miss him.

742
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:27,700
What about you?
I mean, if that's too personal, you know.

743
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:30,700
If I'm overstepping like a boundary or...

744
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,700
You know what? Too bad. Cough it up.

745
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:34,800
Okay.

746
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,400
Well, where do I start?

747
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:42,800
I was married, and life was good.

748
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:48,000
Yeah. It seems like
forever ago now, but...

749
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,700
One day, a bad storm rolled in.

750
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:55,700
Bessy and I were in the meadow
and we found a place on high ground.

751
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:58,700
But when we went home,

752
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:03,900
well, everyone was gone.

753
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:08,900
You know what I think?

754
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,900
I think some good things are gonna
start happening to you and me.

755
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:16,800
What, do you wanna be a hero, cow?

756
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,500
Hey, you're Ben's kid.

757
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:35,600
Otis, right?

758
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:39,100
So they left you in charge?

759
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,000
Oh, that's precious.

760
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:47,200
You thought you could fill his shoes?

761
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:51,000
Otis, where were you?

762
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:56,300
Were you off having fun?
Laughing with your barnyard buddies?

763
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:58,700
Yeah, you could have made a difference
had you been there for him,

764
00:57:58,700 --> 00:57:59,800
but you weren't. Were you?

765
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Okay, from here on out,
this is the way it's gonna work.

766
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:09,100
We show up, you look the other way.

767
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:11,900
A few animals missing here and there.

768
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:14,800
Hey, it's the natural order of things.

769
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,300
It'll be our little secret.

770
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:20,400
Oh, and Ben's kid,

771
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:23,900
if you should think about getting
a sudden burst of courage,

772
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:26,400
we slaughter every animal in sight.

773
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:29,500
Now, you go back,
make everyone feel all safe,

774
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:32,900
and we'll be seeing you tomorrow night.
That's a date.

775
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,500
See you around.

776
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:40,900
"Round." You're fat.

777
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:43,400
Hey, Pop.

778
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:47,100
I wanted to come by and...

779
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:52,800
Look, you were just a great dad.

780
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:56,600
You see, I...

781
00:59:57,100 --> 01:00:01,600
I don't know what I was thinking,
but, for a minute, I actually thought

782
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:03,400
I could take your place.

783
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:06,700
But those coyotes?

784
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:11,000
I mean, you'd have stood up to them
and you wouldn't have backed down.

785
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:15,500
I gotta tell you, I was so afraid.

786
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:22,100
You know, I know I always said
that I wasn't you, and I'm not.

787
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,000
But I wish I was.

788
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:29,700
I can't do it, Pop.

789
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:31,600
I gotta go.

790
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,000
I'm sorry.

791
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,200
And Duke will handle things,
and everything will be fine.

792
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:48,600
Wait. What are you talking about?

793
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:50,300
Could you just not say anything?

794
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:53,200
Okay, I don't want to make
a big thing about this.

795
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:56,900
Hey, everybody!
Otis is leaving the barnyard!

796
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,300
- What's going on?
- I don't believe it.

797
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:08,500
Oat, seriously,

798
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:12,900
I mean, you and me,
we're like best friends.

799
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:14,500
No, Pip. It's over!

800
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:18,400
I'm leaving, all right? No big whoop.
Continue your day.

801
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:20,700
Come on, Otis, we'll do what you say.

802
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:22,700
That's the point.
I don't want you to do what I say.

803
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:24,600
I don't want any of you
to have to listen to me.

804
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:26,400
Don't listen to him!

805
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:29,000
Stop doing what I say!

806
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,900
Okay, so what you're saying is,
you'll stay if we don't do what you say.

807
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,000
Dead bee.

808
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:37,700
Thanks.

809
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:40,200
Again, alive.

810
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:42,600
Duke, you're in charge.
Get the dogs together.

811
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,700
You guys can handle things
better than I ever could.

812
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:46,400
Sure, Otis. If you say.

813
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:49,300
I've got my own life to lead, all right?
I don't belong here anymore.

814
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:12,000
- Hi.
- Hey.

815
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:17,100
What happened, Otis?
Oh, please don't say, "Nothing."

816
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:20,100
Look, it's complicated.

817
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:23,700
If you're hurting, let me help.
I'd like to help.

818
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:28,500
You know what happened?
I froze. Okay?

819
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:33,100
Last night, I didn't run the coyotes off.
I couldn't do anything.

820
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:37,200
They're gonna come back tonight,
and I can't protect anyone.

821
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:41,800
Everyone here, they all trust me.
And I can't protect a single one of them.

822
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:46,600
Otis, the best leader
isn't the biggest or the strongest.

823
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,000
The best leader is the one
who cares the most.

824
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:54,300
Yeah, that's a nice thought, Daisy.
That's a really nice thought.

825
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:59,300
I'll tell you one thing.
I am really going to miss Bessy.

826
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:08,100
Okay. If this is what you have to do,
I understand.

827
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:11,100
But I just want you to know one thing.

828
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:15,000
Even if you do leave, I believe in you.

829
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:28,700
Otis! Otis!

830
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:37,200
All right, Peck, take it easy.
What's the matter?

831
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:41,100
They took... We got to... Come on!

832
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:45,500
I found him, guys!

833
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:50,100
Otis, the coyotes. It just happened.

834
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:53,600
They took Etta, Hanna,
maybe six, seven others, I don't know.

835
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:55,800
They've never come
during the day before.

836
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:58,300
They knew I wouldn't be
expecting them until tonight.

837
01:03:58,300 --> 01:03:59,600
They played me.

838
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:01,200
- What?
- Nothing.

839
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:04,300
Otis, they took Maddie.

840
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:11,100
Those coyotes are strong.

841
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:14,500
What?

842
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:16,900
The coyotes, they're strong.

843
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:21,600
I was just wondering
what a stronger man might do.

844
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:43,600
- You'll look after things?
- Be proud to.

845
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,400
I'll be back.

846
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:04,100
- I'm going, too.
- No, Pip, stay here.

847
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:06,600
You can't do this alone.
They could kill you.

848
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:08,600
Yeah, I guess they could.

849
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:50,800
It's nice that you ladies
could join us this evening.

850
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:55,000
Thank you for being so patient.
We prefer dining at night.

851
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:03,000
You're a wonderful species.

852
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:07,800
I love chicken.
My favorite part is the skin.

853
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:09,400
You're a big meanie.

854
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,500
- What?
- You're a meaner.

855
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:15,600
Meaner, meaner.
Meaners got to eat, too.

856
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:17,200
Leave her alone.

857
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:19,300
This one's mine.

858
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:22,100
Cook her while I have the little one
for an appetizer.

859
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:24,500
You know, because I'm a meaner.

860
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:31,900
Put the chick down, Dag.

861
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,100
- Otis!
- Oaty!

862
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:44,000
We suddenly got a burst of courage,
did we?

863
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:45,300
Okay. All right.

864
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:49,000
Well, first, what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna take that chick from you.

865
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:51,600
Then, while you're picking yourself
up off the ground,

866
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:55,000
I'm gonna gather up the hens
and I'm gonna leave.

867
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,100
And exactly how do you propose
you're going to do that?

868
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:07,100
Kill him!

869
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:10,300
<i>Well, I know what's right</i>

870
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:14,400
<i>I got just one life</i>

871
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:19,800
<i>In a world that keeps on</i>
<i>pushing me around</i>

872
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:22,800
<i>But I'll stand my ground</i>

873
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:26,900
<i>And I won't back down</i>

874
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:31,000
<i>Hey, baby</i>

875
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:35,200
<i>There ain't no easy way out</i>

876
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:38,700
<i>Hey</i>

877
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:43,400
<i>I will stand my ground</i>

878
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:47,600
<i>And I won't back down</i>

879
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:49,800
Oh, you like that, yeah?

880
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:03,100
That should do. That should do.

881
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:08,500
Well, look at the hero.

882
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:12,100
You thought you could come
into my den?

883
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:15,900
Now, why don't you lay there and watch

884
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:18,500
while we eat your friends?

885
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:32,900
What's this?

886
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:37,200
A strong man stands up for himself.

887
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:41,700
A stronger man stands up for others.

888
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:45,600
This should be fun.

889
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:56,300
I smell fear.

890
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:59,200
Shoot! I told you they can smell it!

891
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:00,800
They can smell it?

892
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:04,700
Oh, yeah, I have it. I have a lot of it.

893
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:07,300
Just stick near me, guys,
and you'll be all right.

894
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:09,900
Yeah, I'll watch your juicy back.

895
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:11,800
I mean, your regular back.

896
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:15,600
- Hey!
- Sorry, man.

897
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:18,200
They're just pellets. I'm nervous.

898
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,600
That's your army?

899
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:29,800
Something tells me you may want
to take a couple steps back.

900
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:36,500
Here we come!

901
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:38,000
- Here comes trou...
- Ble!

902
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,300
- Trou...
- Ble!

903
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:40,800
- Trou...
- Ble!

904
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:53,800
Pip, talk me into it. Talk me into it.

905
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:56,200
Flip the lid a little bit.
You're mad! You're a pig!

906
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:58,300
- You're mad!
- Let's do this!

907
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:12,300
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna go right in your ear!

908
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:17,100
There's a mouse in my ear!
There's a mouse in my ear!

909
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:20,400
Oh, yeah. Step on it, baby!

910
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:29,800
All right, come on.
Give me your best shot.

911
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:32,800
Oh, sorry. Here. You know what?
Let me give you a hand.

912
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:35,900
Yeah, give him the puncher!
Smack him!

913
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:05,300
Well, well, whatever will I do?

914
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:13,500
Oh, don't worry,
I got something special for you.

915
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:34,000
I just love that little guy.

916
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:35,600
Come on, hurry.

917
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:41,800
- No!
- Hi!

918
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:46,600
It tastes like chicken!

919
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:48,300
Chicken!

920
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:50,000
Chick, chick, chickity-chick, chicken!

921
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:53,200
Come here,
you furry, four-legged chickens!

922
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:58,500
Take it easy, man.

923
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:01,400
Come on, what you got going?
There's nothing there.

924
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:11,700
Hey, Otis, look out!

925
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:13,700
- Behind you!
- Watch out!

926
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:18,200
Watch out!

927
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:24,400
Look behind you.

928
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:32,000
Remember me?

929
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:34,000
I'm Ben's kid.

930
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:49,500
Never come back!

931
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:55,200
- Pip?
- I'd have to go with the iron, man.

932
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:13,700
Then I said
I was gonna hit him with a stick.

933
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:16,300
We know. We know.
I heard you say that.

934
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:17,900
Quite a night, huh?

935
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:20,400
We took down the coyotes,
Peck learned to crow,

936
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:21,700
and by the time we get back,

937
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:24,000
we'll have a new member
of the barnyard running around.

938
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:27,400
Daisy. She like went into labor
after you left.

939
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
- Daisy's...
- She's having her baby, dude.

940
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:32,600
What you think was gonna happen?

941
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:34,400
She would just keep getting
bigger or something?

942
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:37,200
- Is she all right? We've gotta get back.
- Yeah.

943
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:39,700
Doubtful we'll make it
back in time walking.

944
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:42,000
I'm sure she's gonna be all right, Otis.

945
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,600
Miles, I've got to be there.

946
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:52,300
Please remember, mister,
that I am a lady.

947
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:55,500
When you are with me,
your eyes are on me, not her.

948
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:02,100
We can call and tell them
where to pick them up.

949
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:23,200
Car!

950
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:28,900
Righteous!

951
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:45,400
Duke, what's happening?

952
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:49,700
Otis, come on. You know, I think...
I'm pretty sure... Yeah, it's time.

953
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:58,300
Boy.

954
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,200
Otis, I was so worried.

955
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:30,300
Worried about what?
I so had that covered.

956
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:32,700
It's okay, I'm here.

957
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:38,100
And I'm here for you, too.

958
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,500
Okay, girl, you're doing fine.
Now, just breathe.

959
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:15,600
Man, that looks like it hurts.

960
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:18,200
Oh, that's very profound, Insight-Man.

961
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:20,300
Well, excuse me for being a pig.

962
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:22,300
How come nothing's happened yet?

963
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:24,600
She's gonna be all right, though, huh?

964
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:27,700
Yeah, like, like...
What if it gets stuck or something?

965
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:32,000
What? You mean like stuck halfway,
so she'd be a cow and a half?

966
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:33,800
I didn't say "cow and a half."

967
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:35,500
Yes, you did. You just did.

968
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:39,500
- Hey, Duke, did I say "Cow and a half"?
- I'm not doing this.

969
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,000
No, look.

970
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:49,000
It's a beautiful little boy.

971
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:53,500
Go ahead.

972
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:02,100
He's perfect.

973
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:05,700
What are you gonna name him?

974
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:08,700
I was thinking I kind of like

975
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:11,400
Ben.

976
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:19,300
Oh, I think that's just great.

977
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:22,200
Hey, there, little Ben.

978
01:17:24,700 --> 01:17:28,000
Hey, there, little buddy. Look at you.

979
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Look at my little buddy.

980
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,300
Here you go.

981
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,500
Hey, Otis, we were all talking,

982
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:49,200
and we know you may have
other plans, we understand that,

983
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:52,200
but we really, really appreciate
what you did around here.

984
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:54,400
And, well, we were wondering,
I don't know,

985
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:57,000
if maybe you planned
on staying around a little longer?

986
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,500
<i>Freedom is a song</i>

987
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:01,300
<i>Freedom is a spirit</i>

988
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:05,100
<i>To take another's hand</i>

989
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,100
I'll just say this,

990
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:09,900
as long as I'm still kicking,

991
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:14,200
no animal will be harmed
inside that fence.

992
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:21,900
High paw!

993
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:24,700
Hey, all right.

994
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:32,200
<i>Freedom is a song</i>

995
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:35,100
<i>Freedom is a spirit</i>

996
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:37,700
<i>For people who are strong</i>

997
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,300
<i>Freedom is a spirit</i>

998
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:43,300
<i>Freedom is a land</i>

999
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:46,200
<i>Freedom is the courage</i>

1000
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:48,500
<i>To take another's hand</i>

1001
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,400
I, Nora Beady, am a precious object

1002
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:15,900
and shall treat myself as such.

1003
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:22,400
Gosh, I wonder why...
I forgot to use conditioner or...
