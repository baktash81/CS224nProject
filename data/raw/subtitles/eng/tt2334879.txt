1
00:00:58,001 --> 00:01:01,121
<i>The vice president is scheduled
to preside over a Senate vote today...</i>

2
00:01:01,281 --> 00:01:04,201
<i>...on President Sawyer's
controversial Middle East peace plan.</i>

3
00:01:04,361 --> 00:01:06,441
<i>Then tomorrow,
the vote will go to Congress.</i>

4
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:08,321
<i>Republicans and Democrats...</i>

5
00:01:08,481 --> 00:01:10,961
<i>...have indicated they will vote
along party lines...</i>

6
00:01:11,121 --> 00:01:13,841
<i>...but some members have indicated
that they may cross over.</i>

7
00:01:39,801 --> 00:01:41,041
Castle, this is Hummingbird.

8
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:43,601
We are inbound from Andy.
We're three minutes out.

9
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:48,081
Carol. He wants to do the thing.

10
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:49,921
- Really?
- Really.

11
00:01:50,081 --> 00:01:53,681
Mr. President, it isn't a good idea
to deviate from the flight plan.

12
00:01:53,841 --> 00:01:54,881
Pretty please, Carol?

13
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:57,241
Leader of the free world
saying "pretty please"?

14
00:01:57,401 --> 00:01:59,201
That ought to count for something.

15
00:02:02,001 --> 00:02:04,641
Captain Johns, we are going to deviate
from Route Omaha.

16
00:02:04,801 --> 00:02:07,761
The president would like
to do the thing.

17
00:02:07,921 --> 00:02:10,161
<i>Copy that.
Let's give him the special tour.</i>

18
00:02:10,321 --> 00:02:12,161
<i>Dropping to 30 feet.</i>

19
00:02:44,241 --> 00:02:47,081
Do you know that Abraham Lincoln
was the first U.S. president...

20
00:02:47,241 --> 00:02:49,841
...who was in favour of women
having the vote?

21
00:02:50,001 --> 00:02:53,441
He wrote a paper on suffrage while
he was still in the Illinois legislature.

22
00:02:53,601 --> 00:02:54,641
Yes, I did know that...

23
00:02:54,801 --> 00:02:56,801
...because you tell me
every time we do this.

24
00:03:00,241 --> 00:03:03,681
<i>Castle, this is Hummingbird.
We are short Foxtrot, one minute out.</i>

25
00:03:03,841 --> 00:03:06,761
<i>- I need a go-no go.
- Sky Sector 1, Castle Ground...</i>

26
00:03:06,921 --> 00:03:08,841
<i>...all clear, three inbound.</i>

27
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,881
<i>Castle Ground, Sky Sector 1, report.</i>

28
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:15,361
Hummingbird, this is Castle Ground.
You are clear.

29
00:03:15,521 --> 00:03:17,441
Scanning sky south.

30
00:03:18,521 --> 00:03:19,521
Clear.

31
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,361
Clear.

32
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:24,881
Hummingbird, this is Castle Sky.

33
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:26,401
<i>You are clear.</i>

34
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:29,841
Hummingbird, this is Castle Keep.
You are... Wait. Hold.

35
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,201
<i>- Castle Ground, we are holding.</i>
- Air Command...

36
00:03:32,361 --> 00:03:33,921
...switch to thermal.
<i>- Roger that.</i>

37
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:35,081
Switching to thermal.

38
00:03:36,721 --> 00:03:38,641
<i>Confirm Sector 5,
southeast quadrant clear.</i>

39
00:03:42,761 --> 00:03:44,881
Hummingbird, this is Castle Keep.
You're clear.

40
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,481
<i>Copy that.</i>

41
00:03:47,801 --> 00:03:50,721
<i>Breaking off for security sweep.
Stand by.</i>

42
00:04:00,201 --> 00:04:01,641
Hummingbird approaching.

43
00:04:02,481 --> 00:04:04,361
<i>Castle Ground, all clear.</i>

44
00:04:06,321 --> 00:04:08,201
Be it ever so humble.

45
00:04:13,361 --> 00:04:15,641
Atten-hut! Escort!

46
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:19,001
Not a bad way to travel, is it?

47
00:04:19,161 --> 00:04:21,401
Beats Dupont Circle, sir.

48
00:04:24,361 --> 00:04:26,081
What time does my wife get in?

49
00:04:26,241 --> 00:04:29,521
- Eighteen forty-five.
- Wake me if civilisation ends.

50
00:04:31,801 --> 00:04:33,721
- Welcome home, sir.
- Thank you.

51
00:04:33,881 --> 00:04:35,921
Hummingbird, you are released.

52
00:04:37,681 --> 00:04:41,361
Tell me we don't have the best job
in the world.

53
00:04:43,321 --> 00:04:47,521
<i>I believe the number-one source
of violence in our world is poverty.</i>

54
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:52,001
<i>Now, we were poor in my neighbourhood.
Sometimes we couldn't even eat.</i>

55
00:04:52,161 --> 00:04:54,521
<i>And my best friend Ricky,
he had it worse than us.</i>

56
00:04:54,681 --> 00:04:56,641
<i>One day things got
so desperate for Ricky...</i>

57
00:04:56,801 --> 00:04:58,641
<i>...he made a plan
to rob the corner store.</i>

58
00:04:58,801 --> 00:05:01,361
<i>And I told my mother about it.
You know what she did?</i>

59
00:05:01,521 --> 00:05:04,481
<i>She had him over,
cooked him a full meal...</i>

60
00:05:04,641 --> 00:05:07,441
<i>...and told him that he could stay with us
as long as he wanted.</i>

61
00:05:07,601 --> 00:05:10,161
<i>And it was then that I realised
that if you feed a man...</i>

62
00:05:10,321 --> 00:05:12,281
<i>you take away his propensity
for violence.</i>

63
00:05:12,441 --> 00:05:14,001
Come on, we're gonna be late.

64
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:16,241
Hey, hey, hey.

65
00:05:16,401 --> 00:05:19,081
No, no, no. That's... No, that's not...
That's not...

66
00:05:19,241 --> 00:05:20,961
This is not happening right now.

67
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:22,761
Clyde, we've had this conversation.

68
00:05:22,921 --> 00:05:25,201
My boss does not like squirrels.
It's a bird feeder.

69
00:05:26,961 --> 00:05:29,521
Will you at least look at me
when I'm talking to you?

70
00:05:29,681 --> 00:05:33,441
Look, man, I like squirrels personally,
but you're getting me in trouble.

71
00:05:33,681 --> 00:05:35,241
Do you see this?

72
00:05:35,681 --> 00:05:37,001
You know what this is?

73
00:05:37,561 --> 00:05:39,601
Hey. We gonna need backup?

74
00:05:42,321 --> 00:05:43,761
We're working. Come on.

75
00:05:43,921 --> 00:05:46,241
- We have any more Robitussin?
- Yes, sir. In the car.

76
00:05:46,401 --> 00:05:48,401
No, I'll get it, it's all right.
Quiet night?

77
00:05:48,561 --> 00:05:50,201
We're under attack by squirrels.

78
00:05:50,361 --> 00:05:52,321
They're organised
and they have the numbers.

79
00:05:52,481 --> 00:05:54,481
Little stinkers trying to get
into the feeder?

80
00:05:54,641 --> 00:05:55,641
- Morning.
- Hey, Roy.

81
00:05:55,801 --> 00:05:57,841
This isn't the most glamorous job
in the world.

82
00:05:58,121 --> 00:05:59,561
Look, I appreciate it very much.

83
00:05:59,721 --> 00:06:03,721
- Yeah, we'll be there in 10 minutes.
<i>- As leaders, we have a choice.</i>

84
00:06:03,881 --> 00:06:06,681
<i>We can sit back
and let the same cycle of war...</i>

85
00:06:06,841 --> 00:06:09,801
<i>...continue in the Middle East
or we can do something about it.</i>

86
00:06:09,961 --> 00:06:12,721
<i>You know how much money
we've spent on the war since 2001?</i>

87
00:06:12,881 --> 00:06:16,241
<i>Over a trillion dollars.
Could you imagine if you had...</i>

88
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:18,561
It's gonna be a busy morning, boys.

89
00:06:18,721 --> 00:06:22,801
<i>...education, food, health care
and infrastructure in the Middle East.</i>

90
00:06:22,961 --> 00:06:25,841
<i>Now, we've begun historic talks
with the republic of Iran's...</i>

91
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:28,081
<i>...newly elected president, Al-Sharif...</i>

92
00:06:28,241 --> 00:06:31,601
<i>...to build peace throughout his region.
America can't do this alone.</i>

93
00:06:31,761 --> 00:06:34,481
<i>We need the full financial support
of all of our allies.</i>

94
00:06:34,641 --> 00:06:36,641
<i>But what we can do
is take the first step.</i>

95
00:06:36,801 --> 00:06:38,321
<i>Therefore, I'm announcing today...</i>

96
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:41,361
<i>...that all U.S. troops will be removed
from the Middle East.</i>

97
00:06:41,521 --> 00:06:44,361
<i>Let's not repeat the same mistakes
that we made in the past.</i>

98
00:06:44,521 --> 00:06:47,201
<i>And Lord knows,
I've made some mistakes myself.</i>

99
00:06:47,361 --> 00:06:50,281
<i>Instead, I ask you
to stand with me today.</i>

100
00:06:50,441 --> 00:06:53,961
<i>Sign this treaty. Let's end
this debilitating pattern of violence...</i>

101
00:06:54,121 --> 00:06:57,561
<i>...and let's show the world that the pen
is truly mightier than the sword.</i>

102
00:06:57,721 --> 00:06:58,721
<i>Thank you.</i>

103
00:06:58,881 --> 00:07:02,361
<i>President Sawyer delivered what can
only be described as a historic speech...</i>

104
00:07:02,521 --> 00:07:04,481
<i>- ...earlier today in Geneva.</i>
- Here.

105
00:07:04,641 --> 00:07:07,121
<i>- Let's go live...</i>
- You changed your hair.

106
00:07:07,921 --> 00:07:09,041
Last week.

107
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:10,881
I'm gonna be late tonight.

108
00:07:12,201 --> 00:07:14,001
I love you very much.

109
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:24,241
Good morning, sir.

110
00:07:28,521 --> 00:07:30,881
John, what do you think
of the president's proposal?

111
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:33,641
I don't know. It's good
to have less enemies, I guess.

112
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:36,561
You're a military man.
You don't think he's putting us at risk?

113
00:07:36,721 --> 00:07:39,441
That's a little above my pay grade.
If you feel that way...

114
00:07:39,601 --> 00:07:41,881
- ...why didn't you run against him?
- No, no, no.

115
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:44,281
That's one job I never wanted.
I like my office.

116
00:07:44,441 --> 00:07:45,801
I like my constituents.

117
00:07:45,961 --> 00:07:48,401
I like being a thorn in the side
of the administration.

118
00:07:48,561 --> 00:07:50,761
But I think voters today
want somebody cool.

119
00:07:50,961 --> 00:07:53,841
Oh, come on, Mr. Speaker,
I think you're pretty cool.

120
00:07:57,921 --> 00:07:59,841
He went to bed at 8 and watched...

121
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:02,881
The president has a call scheduled
with the speaker at 9:30.

122
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:05,121
- I should be there for that, shouldn't I?
- No.

123
00:08:05,281 --> 00:08:07,681
You have to be here
in case of a deadlock...

124
00:08:07,841 --> 00:08:09,201
Hey, I'm gonna see you later.

125
00:08:09,361 --> 00:08:10,961
...With the red tie for that.

126
00:08:11,121 --> 00:08:12,881
- Jenna?
- Absolutely, Mr. Vice President.

127
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:15,201
Red tie's the way to go.

128
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:18,561
Jenna. Jenna. Did you get me in?

129
00:08:18,721 --> 00:08:21,001
- What do I get if I did?
- What do you want?

130
00:08:21,161 --> 00:08:22,201
Dinner. Candlelight.

131
00:08:22,361 --> 00:08:25,681
And a promise that you will try
to get to second base.

132
00:08:26,281 --> 00:08:27,401
Done.

133
00:08:27,561 --> 00:08:30,161
You're meeting with Carol Finnerty,
deputy special agent...

134
00:08:30,321 --> 00:08:32,641
...in charge of the president's
Secret Service.

135
00:08:32,801 --> 00:08:34,761
- I need a favour.
- This is a favour.

136
00:08:34,921 --> 00:08:37,281
I need another favour.
I need a pass for my daughter.

137
00:08:37,441 --> 00:08:38,961
- John...
- You don't understand.

138
00:08:39,121 --> 00:08:42,681
She's a freak for this kind of stuff,
so if I get her in, I'm Dad of the Year.

139
00:08:42,841 --> 00:08:45,481
I will owe you so much more
than just candlelight dinner.

140
00:08:46,521 --> 00:08:49,521
- I'll make a call.
- Perfect. Thank you. You're the best.

141
00:09:18,961 --> 00:09:20,881
<i>...a truly historic handshake.</i>

142
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:24,521
<i>What President Sawyer is proposing
to Iranian president Al-Sharif...</i>

143
00:09:24,681 --> 00:09:28,281
<i>...is withdrawing all American troops
across the entire Middle East...</i>

144
00:09:28,441 --> 00:09:30,721
<i>...and for that he'll ask
his G8 partners for help.</i>

145
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:33,321
<i>It's all about money,
and who won't like this deal...</i>

146
00:09:33,481 --> 00:09:36,561
<i>...are American companies who do
business with the American military.</i>

147
00:09:36,801 --> 00:09:39,601
Wanna grab the door? Em.

148
00:09:39,761 --> 00:09:41,201
I'll get it.

149
00:09:43,441 --> 00:09:44,761
- Hey.
- You're late.

150
00:09:44,921 --> 00:09:48,441
- She thought you weren't coming.
- Why wouldn't I be coming?

151
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:52,241
Hey, you, little face.
Come on, get your stuff. Let's go, baby.

152
00:09:55,481 --> 00:09:58,001
- Bye, Mommy. I love you.
- I love you too, sweetie.

153
00:09:58,841 --> 00:09:59,841
What's up...?

154
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:04,921
I literally just walked in the door.
What did I do?

155
00:10:05,081 --> 00:10:06,721
You missed her talent show.

156
00:10:06,881 --> 00:10:09,681
No, I didn't miss it.
That's, like, next Thursday.

157
00:10:09,841 --> 00:10:12,321
No, it was last Thursday.

158
00:10:12,481 --> 00:10:14,601
It was on the school calendar.

159
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:17,361
What did she do?

160
00:10:17,521 --> 00:10:18,961
She was a flag twirler.

161
00:10:21,081 --> 00:10:22,321
That's a talent?

162
00:10:22,481 --> 00:10:26,561
She practised for like six weeks, John.
She thought you were gonna be there.

163
00:10:26,721 --> 00:10:29,361
It would've been really nice
to have a bit of a reminder.

164
00:10:29,521 --> 00:10:33,281
- Come on, I'm not your secretary, John.
- I'm not asking you to be my secretary.

165
00:10:33,441 --> 00:10:35,321
Look, I'm just... I'm trying.

166
00:10:35,481 --> 00:10:37,361
I'm trying really hard to be in her life.

167
00:10:37,521 --> 00:10:39,601
It's a little late for that,
wouldn't you say?

168
00:10:43,721 --> 00:10:44,721
Have a good day.

169
00:10:48,201 --> 00:10:50,241
Are you mad at me?

170
00:10:50,401 --> 00:10:51,521
Just tell me.

171
00:10:51,681 --> 00:10:53,321
Will you be on that all day long?

172
00:10:59,561 --> 00:11:04,241
"Yes." Well, that sucks, because,
you know, I thought you would...

173
00:11:04,401 --> 00:11:06,481
- ...want this, but...
- Lame.

174
00:11:06,641 --> 00:11:08,641
You don't even know what it is.

175
00:11:10,121 --> 00:11:12,681
Do you really think a bribe's
gonna work?

176
00:11:12,841 --> 00:11:14,481
Yeah. I'm hoping so.

177
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:17,881
- We're both adults here, John.
- Speak for yourself, okay?

178
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,921
Can you please just open it?

179
00:11:20,081 --> 00:11:22,521
- For me?
- What is it?

180
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:26,041
It's a pony, baby. I don't...
Come on, for me, please just...

181
00:11:32,161 --> 00:11:33,641
These are White House passes.

182
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:37,401
Yeah. That might mean
we're going to the White House.

183
00:11:37,561 --> 00:11:39,601
And that your dad here
has a job interview...

184
00:11:39,761 --> 00:11:41,281
...with the Secret Service.

185
00:11:42,481 --> 00:11:44,081
This is really cool, John.

186
00:11:46,161 --> 00:11:48,801
- You're just gonna stick with "John"?
- Yeah.

187
00:11:51,121 --> 00:11:53,801
<i>Now The Roger Skinner Show,
today live from the White House.</i>

188
00:11:53,961 --> 00:11:56,481
<i>Hi, folks. President Sawyer
is one of those academics...</i>

189
00:11:56,641 --> 00:11:58,441
<i>...who never served a day in his life...</i>

190
00:11:58,601 --> 00:12:01,561
<i>...and now he wants to tell the military
how to run things?</i>

191
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,961
<i>He's going to make peace with Iran
because he has friends there now?</i>

192
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:06,721
Come on.

193
00:12:06,881 --> 00:12:08,481
Sir, I have the first lady for you.

194
00:12:08,641 --> 00:12:11,401
Remind me again why we let these guys
broadcast from our lawn.

195
00:12:11,561 --> 00:12:13,201
- Freedom of the press.
- You know what?

196
00:12:13,361 --> 00:12:14,961
I knew it was something.

197
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:17,881
Hey, babe.
How are the French taking it?

198
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,721
The treaty's gonna be
a tough sell here.

199
00:12:20,881 --> 00:12:22,961
- How's it going there?
<i>- Raphelson is the key.</i>

200
00:12:23,121 --> 00:12:26,161
We lose him, then we lose
that Southern voting bloc.

201
00:12:26,321 --> 00:12:28,961
If this goes down, you're looking
at a one-term president.

202
00:12:29,121 --> 00:12:31,761
I know two people who wouldn't
have a problem with that.

203
00:12:31,921 --> 00:12:33,681
<i>Do you still have that watch
I gave you?</i>

204
00:12:33,841 --> 00:12:36,561
Yes, Miss First Lady.
It's in my pocket next to my heart.

205
00:12:36,721 --> 00:12:38,641
You know, Mary Todd
gave it to Lincoln...

206
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:41,521
...to remind him he only had
so much time to do good things...

207
00:12:41,681 --> 00:12:43,921
...while he was in that chair.
<i>- I hear you.</i>

208
00:12:44,081 --> 00:12:46,481
Well, kiss Amber for me, okay?

209
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:48,081
<i>I love you ladies. Miss you.</i>

210
00:12:48,241 --> 00:12:51,881
- I gotta go back to being president.
- I love you too.

211
00:12:54,001 --> 00:12:58,001
Did you know that 1.5 million people
visit the White House every year?

212
00:12:58,161 --> 00:13:00,641
No, I did not know that.

213
00:13:00,801 --> 00:13:02,001
Look, I'm sorry.

214
00:13:02,161 --> 00:13:05,081
I'm sorry that I didn't make it
to your talent show.

215
00:13:05,841 --> 00:13:06,921
I'm not.

216
00:13:08,681 --> 00:13:09,681
Seriously.

217
00:13:09,841 --> 00:13:13,441
Did you know the White House used
to be called the Presidential Palace?

218
00:13:13,601 --> 00:13:16,881
Look, I need you to hear me right now.
Look at me.

219
00:13:17,361 --> 00:13:19,081
I really wished I was there.

220
00:13:20,721 --> 00:13:22,481
No, you don't.

221
00:13:22,641 --> 00:13:26,761
All I... All I did was twirl a flag.
It was stupid.

222
00:13:26,921 --> 00:13:29,361
You know that you don't
have to do that with me, right?

223
00:13:29,521 --> 00:13:32,441
- What?
- Have thick skin. You're 11.

224
00:13:38,121 --> 00:13:39,601
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

225
00:13:39,881 --> 00:13:41,681
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you. Yourself?

226
00:13:41,841 --> 00:13:43,761
- Good.
- Photo IDs, please.

227
00:13:44,841 --> 00:13:46,481
Thank you.

228
00:13:48,401 --> 00:13:50,721
- What are you guys looking for?
- Explosives.

229
00:13:53,081 --> 00:13:54,761
This is awesome.

230
00:13:54,921 --> 00:13:57,001
Park up on the left,
go into the East Lobby.

231
00:13:57,161 --> 00:13:58,801
Have a good one.

232
00:14:02,481 --> 00:14:05,841
Did you know that the president
travels in an 18-ton military-armoured...

233
00:14:06,001 --> 00:14:08,561
...modified Cadillac CTS
built to withstand gas...

234
00:14:08,721 --> 00:14:11,601
...chemical and missile attacks?

235
00:14:11,761 --> 00:14:13,361
- That's on the Internet?
- Wikipedia.

236
00:14:14,761 --> 00:14:17,281
- Capitol Police, off-duty.
- Have to check your weapon.

237
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:18,641
All right.

238
00:14:29,641 --> 00:14:31,041
Check her good.

239
00:14:34,161 --> 00:14:36,001
- Hey, Tom.
- Hey, buddy.

240
00:14:41,921 --> 00:14:44,561
So how is your blog coming along?

241
00:14:44,721 --> 00:14:46,881
Nobody says "blog" anymore, John.

242
00:14:47,121 --> 00:14:48,881
What do you mean,
they don't say "blog"?

243
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:50,601
- I just learned "blog."
- Hi. Hi.

244
00:14:50,761 --> 00:14:52,961
Just for 20 seconds,
act like you don't hate me.

245
00:14:53,121 --> 00:14:54,561
- I'm Carol Finnerty.
- Hi. John.

246
00:14:55,921 --> 00:14:57,681
- Carol?
- Cale.

247
00:14:58,321 --> 00:14:59,721
Oh, my God. Carol Wilkes.

248
00:14:59,881 --> 00:15:01,601
Actually, I'm Carol Finnerty now.

249
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:04,721
You're Deputy Special Agent Finnerty?

250
00:15:04,881 --> 00:15:06,121
Oh, you're Jenna's favour.

251
00:15:10,081 --> 00:15:12,041
This is Emily.
This is Em, my daughter.

252
00:15:12,441 --> 00:15:15,201
My father is a very special man.

253
00:15:16,521 --> 00:15:18,441
It's nice to meet you.

254
00:15:18,601 --> 00:15:20,361
I paid her to say that.

255
00:15:21,201 --> 00:15:23,641
- Let's get started.
- Okay.

256
00:15:25,441 --> 00:15:27,641
I don't know. Just...

257
00:15:30,121 --> 00:15:31,401
Sorry, I gotta ask.

258
00:15:31,561 --> 00:15:34,001
You didn't marry Jim Finnerty
from Sigma Chi, did you?

259
00:15:34,161 --> 00:15:36,361
- That guy was...
- An asshole. Yes, he was.

260
00:15:36,601 --> 00:15:38,601
This is my colleague,
Special Agent Todd.

261
00:15:38,761 --> 00:15:40,681
Standard Secret Service
protocol requires...

262
00:15:40,841 --> 00:15:44,761
...a two-agent review for every interview.
You're not to look at Agent Todd.

263
00:15:45,521 --> 00:15:48,481
- I'm sorry, I just looked at him.
- You're only to look at me.

264
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:50,801
So we just... Okay.

265
00:15:51,401 --> 00:15:54,801
The subject is John Cale.

266
00:15:55,001 --> 00:15:58,241
Born 1980,
grew up in the District of Columbia...

267
00:15:58,401 --> 00:16:00,201
...graduated Hill High in 1999.

268
00:16:00,361 --> 00:16:03,401
Looks like you've bounced
from job to job.

269
00:16:03,561 --> 00:16:05,721
Mechanic, limo driver, construction.

270
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,321
Is my credit score in there?

271
00:16:07,481 --> 00:16:10,481
Yes, and you should be ashamed
of yourself.

272
00:16:10,641 --> 00:16:11,761
It's a recession, okay?

273
00:16:11,921 --> 00:16:15,121
Married Melanie Schopp in 2002...

274
00:16:15,281 --> 00:16:17,401
...and had a child six months later.

275
00:16:17,561 --> 00:16:19,881
Filed for divorce in 2005.

276
00:16:21,441 --> 00:16:24,081
So you did three tours
in Afghanistan...

277
00:16:24,241 --> 00:16:26,241
...and you were wounded
in the Kunar province.

278
00:16:26,401 --> 00:16:28,481
- Yes, ma'am.
- You received a Silver Star...

279
00:16:28,641 --> 00:16:31,441
...for pulling a Corporal Dawson
from a burning Humvee?

280
00:16:31,601 --> 00:16:34,361
There was an IED attack.

281
00:16:34,521 --> 00:16:37,161
Humvee flipped, we were taking fire,
so I grabbed him.

282
00:16:37,321 --> 00:16:39,081
- Why?
- I was a little concerned...

283
00:16:39,241 --> 00:16:41,601
...that he was getting
a little too warm in there.

284
00:16:42,161 --> 00:16:44,881
It's funny to me, you still think glib
is the way to go here.

285
00:16:45,241 --> 00:16:48,001
Corporal Dawson is the nephew
of the speaker of the house...

286
00:16:48,161 --> 00:16:50,161
...and when you were discharged
a year ago...

287
00:16:50,321 --> 00:16:52,401
...he got you a job
with the Capitol Police.

288
00:16:52,561 --> 00:16:55,121
Actually, on his protection detail.

289
00:16:56,881 --> 00:16:59,041
If Special Agent Todd
keeps making those sounds...

290
00:16:59,201 --> 00:17:02,961
- ...I'm gonna start looking at him.
- Will you give us a second, please, Ryan?

291
00:17:07,121 --> 00:17:10,161
John, why do you want to be
in the Secret Service?

292
00:17:11,681 --> 00:17:15,001
I can't think of a more important job
than protecting the president.

293
00:17:15,161 --> 00:17:17,481
Okay, this job requires
a university degree.

294
00:17:17,641 --> 00:17:19,961
You dropped out of GW
after our first semester there.

295
00:17:20,121 --> 00:17:23,681
- You don't finish things.
- Check the file, Carol.

296
00:17:23,841 --> 00:17:26,841
Two years in college night school.

297
00:17:27,001 --> 00:17:29,321
A certificate of graduation
should be in there.

298
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:31,001
Great.

299
00:17:31,481 --> 00:17:35,281
Yeah, John, you barely maintained
a C average.

300
00:17:35,441 --> 00:17:37,881
I'm sorry, I didn't have
our little study sessions...

301
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,961
...like we used to back in the day,
did I?

302
00:17:40,121 --> 00:17:41,841
Evaluations from your senior officers:

303
00:17:42,001 --> 00:17:45,001
"Cale frequently does not complete
his field reports on time."

304
00:17:45,161 --> 00:17:46,841
Nothing to do
with protecting someone.

305
00:17:47,001 --> 00:17:49,921
"Sergeant Cale demonstrates
a lack of respect for authority."

306
00:17:50,081 --> 00:17:53,601
"Sergeant Cale has raw potential
but seems determined not to realise it."

307
00:17:53,761 --> 00:17:56,081
You can keep reading that.
That is not me anymore.

308
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,441
I'm not the kid
you used to know in college.

309
00:17:58,601 --> 00:18:02,161
I've buttoned up every single thing
that I have to to qualify for this job.

310
00:18:02,321 --> 00:18:04,881
I have 10 times more experience
than any Ivy League kid.

311
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:09,161
It's not just about experience. I would
need to depend on you every day.

312
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:11,121
What do you want me to do?

313
00:18:11,281 --> 00:18:13,961
I'll start at the...
I'll start at the bottom.

314
00:18:14,881 --> 00:18:17,321
Just give me a chance.

315
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:22,641
I'm sorry.

316
00:18:29,521 --> 00:18:31,281
Did you get the job?

317
00:18:34,801 --> 00:18:38,001
- Yeah, I think I got a shot.
- Really?

318
00:18:38,161 --> 00:18:39,601
You know how it is.

319
00:18:39,761 --> 00:18:42,241
They gotta go talk
amongst themselves and...

320
00:18:42,401 --> 00:18:46,241
These... Look, these things,
they can be really political.

321
00:19:20,241 --> 00:19:22,801
Good morning.
Light day at the White House today.

322
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:25,481
Eagle will remain on the 18 acres.

323
00:19:25,641 --> 00:19:27,921
He has phone calls
to the congressional leadership.

324
00:19:28,081 --> 00:19:29,321
First lady is back tonight?

325
00:19:29,481 --> 00:19:31,561
Empress is wheels down at 1845.

326
00:19:31,721 --> 00:19:35,521
They're supposed to have dinner at the
residence, but you know how they are.

327
00:19:35,681 --> 00:19:38,721
So we should have an advance
on Obelisk, Marcel's, the usual.

328
00:19:38,881 --> 00:19:41,801
- What if she wants sushi?
- No, no, she's off sushi.

329
00:19:41,961 --> 00:19:44,081
Remember she had that thing
on the Japan trip?

330
00:19:44,241 --> 00:19:47,601
- Carol, how are you still awake?
- Caffeine and patriotism, sir.

331
00:19:47,761 --> 00:19:49,201
- Threat matrix?
- Well...

332
00:19:49,361 --> 00:19:52,241
...threats against POTUS
have quadrupled since the G8 speech.

333
00:19:52,401 --> 00:19:55,361
PID is keeping an eye on a guy
in Buffalo they're worried about.

334
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,681
- Visitors today?
- Just the AV guys again.

335
00:19:57,841 --> 00:20:00,841
DC Sonic, they're replacing
the surround system in the theatre.

336
00:20:01,001 --> 00:20:04,241
- First lady must be thrilled.
- And she's...

337
00:20:06,481 --> 00:20:07,921
She's coming back tonight?

338
00:20:09,361 --> 00:20:12,201
Carol, is she coming back tonight?

339
00:20:12,361 --> 00:20:15,561
Yes, sir. Wheels down at 1845.

340
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:18,161
Yes, of course.

341
00:20:18,961 --> 00:20:22,241
As many of you are well-aware,
this is my last week here...

342
00:20:22,401 --> 00:20:24,361
...so I wanna make this clear
to everybody:

343
00:20:24,521 --> 00:20:27,441
If there are any congratulatory cakes
or any of that nonsense...

344
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:30,961
...I will be compelled
to use deadly force.

345
00:20:33,681 --> 00:20:36,881
I hate you. I hate you all.

346
00:20:40,721 --> 00:20:44,561
Thank you. No incendiaries
in the White House.

347
00:20:44,961 --> 00:20:47,441
All right, baby,
I just gotta get my weapon real quick.

348
00:20:47,601 --> 00:20:50,001
You're gonna have to sign out, sir.
Hello.

349
00:20:50,161 --> 00:20:51,961
You guys here for the tour?

350
00:20:52,121 --> 00:20:54,281
Do you think we can see
where you'll be working?

351
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,361
- Yeah, sure.
- Great.

352
00:20:58,401 --> 00:21:01,041
Gather around, everyone,
gather around. My name is Donnie...

353
00:21:01,201 --> 00:21:04,601
...and I'll be your guide today as we take
a walk through American history.

354
00:21:04,761 --> 00:21:08,561
I wanna give you all a warm Washington,
D.C. welcome to the White House...

355
00:21:08,721 --> 00:21:12,241
...where each year we get millions
of guests from every corner of the globe.

356
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:13,681
Where are you folks from?

357
00:21:14,521 --> 00:21:15,601
Washington, D.C.

358
00:21:15,761 --> 00:21:19,321
- Bad choice. What about you, ma'am?
- Nebraska.

359
00:21:19,481 --> 00:21:21,041
What brings you to the White House?

360
00:21:21,201 --> 00:21:24,201
I wanna see the tunnels where JFK
snuck Marilyn Monroe in.

361
00:21:24,361 --> 00:21:27,641
Unfortunately, no such tunnels exist,
but don't worry, we have plenty...

362
00:21:27,801 --> 00:21:29,841
...of other exciting sights
to show you guys.

363
00:21:30,001 --> 00:21:31,961
Follow me this way.

364
00:21:32,121 --> 00:21:34,961
Now, does anyone wanna guess
how old the White House is?

365
00:21:35,121 --> 00:21:37,041
- Yes.
- Two hundred and twenty-two years old.

366
00:21:37,201 --> 00:21:39,321
That's very accurate.

367
00:21:39,481 --> 00:21:41,081
Construction began in 1792...

368
00:21:41,241 --> 00:21:43,441
...on what was then called
the President's House.

369
00:21:43,601 --> 00:21:46,361
Now, Article 1, Section 8
of the U.S. Constitution set forth...

370
00:21:46,521 --> 00:21:48,881
...that a district of no more than
10 miles square...

371
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,921
...should house the new seat
of government. Does anyone know why?

372
00:21:52,081 --> 00:21:54,801
So no one state could claim
the President's House.

373
00:21:54,961 --> 00:21:57,361
Right again.
You're a real keener, aren't you?

374
00:21:57,521 --> 00:21:59,081
Now, the founders were crafty...

375
00:21:59,241 --> 00:22:01,041
Hey, so you can tell me the truth.

376
00:22:01,201 --> 00:22:03,601
Do you get picked on a lot in school?

377
00:22:03,761 --> 00:22:05,441
No, I don't.

378
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:13,801
- It's a gift certificate for a massage.
- I could use one.

379
00:22:13,961 --> 00:22:16,241
Martin, it's... It's been...

380
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:19,721
I know, for me too, Ted.

381
00:22:25,521 --> 00:22:26,921
You know you're gonna miss this.

382
00:22:27,081 --> 00:22:30,201
- When's the last time you took a day off?
- Oh, I'm fine.

383
00:22:30,681 --> 00:22:31,681
I'm fine.

384
00:22:31,841 --> 00:22:35,361
Piece of advice:
You gotta get back on the horse.

385
00:22:36,361 --> 00:22:39,441
- Get back on the horse?
- First rule of divorce: Get right out there.

386
00:22:39,601 --> 00:22:43,121
Sow some oats, break some hearts,
have actual human interaction...

387
00:22:43,281 --> 00:22:45,841
...with a member of the opposite sex.

388
00:22:47,761 --> 00:22:52,401
Carol, you keep this up, 20 years
from now you're gonna look like me.

389
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:54,441
Well, there are worse things.

390
00:22:54,601 --> 00:22:56,001
Don't make this your whole life.

391
00:22:57,201 --> 00:22:58,721
Trust me.

392
00:23:00,201 --> 00:23:01,761
It's not worth it.

393
00:23:06,001 --> 00:23:07,441
Go home.

394
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:09,521
Get some rest.

395
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:11,001
Now.

396
00:23:11,561 --> 00:23:14,081
And that is an order.

397
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:16,481
Yes, sir.

398
00:23:21,081 --> 00:23:22,921
<i>Now, not too many people
realise this...</i>

399
00:23:23,081 --> 00:23:25,321
...but the White House
is actually three buildings:

400
00:23:25,481 --> 00:23:27,201
The East Wing
where you guys came in...

401
00:23:27,361 --> 00:23:30,401
...the West Wing, which houses
the Oval and Executive Offices...

402
00:23:30,561 --> 00:23:33,841
...and we're about to enter the residence,
which is the famous building that...

403
00:23:34,001 --> 00:23:37,081
...got blown up in <i>Independence Day.</i>
- What's in there?

404
00:23:37,241 --> 00:23:40,561
That's the president's home theatre.
Membership has its privileges.

405
00:23:40,721 --> 00:23:43,121
Right this way
through the double doors, please.

406
00:23:43,281 --> 00:23:45,361
There's still lots more to see.

407
00:23:45,921 --> 00:23:47,361
You got a visitor.

408
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:53,761
Hey.

409
00:23:53,921 --> 00:23:55,721
- Could you stay with the tour?
- Yeah.

410
00:23:55,881 --> 00:23:57,361
Thank you.

411
00:24:04,561 --> 00:24:05,921
The White House is big.

412
00:24:06,081 --> 00:24:08,521
Including below-ground levels,
it's six storeys tall...

413
00:24:08,681 --> 00:24:14,481
...with 132 rooms, 412 doors,
147 windows, 28 fireplaces...

414
00:24:14,641 --> 00:24:16,281
...and 35 bathrooms.

415
00:24:16,441 --> 00:24:19,041
The grounds contain a tennis court,
a basketball court...

416
00:24:19,201 --> 00:24:21,841
...a putting green, a jogging track
and a swimming pool.

417
00:24:22,001 --> 00:24:24,401
- And where's the PEOC?
- The what?

418
00:24:24,561 --> 00:24:27,521
She's referring to the Presidential
Emergency Operations Centre...

419
00:24:27,681 --> 00:24:31,001
...which is this really cool bunker
behind 10 feet of concrete and steel...

420
00:24:31,161 --> 00:24:33,961
...that's capable of surviving
a nuclear blast, plus...

421
00:24:34,121 --> 00:24:36,921
...for your information, miss,
it's the one room in the house...

422
00:24:37,081 --> 00:24:38,761
...that no one knows the location of.

423
00:24:38,921 --> 00:24:41,441
WikiLeaks says
it's under the East Wing.

424
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,881
Who wants to see
the bowling alley, huh?

425
00:24:45,041 --> 00:24:46,601
- Oh, my God.
- How we doing, folks?

426
00:24:46,761 --> 00:24:48,241
- Mr. President.
- How's the tour?

427
00:24:48,401 --> 00:24:49,801
You see the basketball court?

428
00:24:49,961 --> 00:24:52,721
Mr. President, can I ask you a question
for my YouTube channel?

429
00:24:52,881 --> 00:24:55,201
- That'd be all right. What's your name?
- Emily Cale.

430
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:56,401
Emily Cale, go ahead.

431
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:58,321
- Okay.
- How I look on that thing?

432
00:24:58,481 --> 00:25:00,161
I wasn't ready for a press conference.

433
00:25:00,321 --> 00:25:03,481
How do you expect 22 Arab nations
with different regional...

434
00:25:03,641 --> 00:25:06,161
...and religious interests
to agree on a single treaty...

435
00:25:06,321 --> 00:25:08,561
...especially given the newly
erupting conflicts...

436
00:25:08,721 --> 00:25:11,361
...between the Shiites and the Sunnis
in southern Pakistan?

437
00:25:11,521 --> 00:25:12,721
Tough question.

438
00:25:13,521 --> 00:25:16,521
To be honest with you, I don't know.
Whether they'll agree or not...

439
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,721
...I'm not sure, but I gotta try.

440
00:25:18,881 --> 00:25:21,681
The day we stop believing
different people can come together...

441
00:25:21,841 --> 00:25:24,681
...is the day we've given up on the world.
I'm not ready to.

442
00:25:24,841 --> 00:25:26,841
What I am ready to do
is give a little girl...

443
00:25:27,001 --> 00:25:28,881
...a shout-out on her YouTube blog.

444
00:25:29,721 --> 00:25:32,241
Hi, folks,
my name is James W. Sawyer...

445
00:25:32,401 --> 00:25:35,161
...and I'm here with Emily Cale
and her video blog.

446
00:25:35,321 --> 00:25:36,601
Check it out.

447
00:25:36,761 --> 00:25:38,161
- You have a good one.
- Wait.

448
00:25:38,321 --> 00:25:40,401
Mr. President, this is my dad John.

449
00:25:40,561 --> 00:25:42,801
He's gonna be
on your Secret Service detail.

450
00:25:42,961 --> 00:25:44,681
Secret Service detail. Is that right?

451
00:25:44,841 --> 00:25:47,281
You know, I take my protection detail
very seriously.

452
00:25:47,441 --> 00:25:51,241
- Yes, sir.
- Stop lying to children.

453
00:25:51,561 --> 00:25:54,401
- Nice to meet you, Emily.
- Nice to meet you too, Mr. President.

454
00:25:54,561 --> 00:25:56,561
You guys have a good one.
Need your vote now.

455
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,561
Oh, my God, that was so fun.

456
00:25:58,721 --> 00:26:01,041
Thought you said no one
says "blog" anymore, huh?

457
00:26:03,081 --> 00:26:04,401
Bye, Fred.

458
00:26:04,561 --> 00:26:06,081
Goodbye, Mrs. Finnerty.

459
00:26:08,121 --> 00:26:10,641
Oil painting by Tom Freeman
to commemorate the burning...

460
00:26:10,801 --> 00:26:13,041
...of the White House
by the British in 1814.

461
00:26:13,201 --> 00:26:16,201
- Wait, the White House burned down?
- Yeah, yeah, in the War of 1812.

462
00:26:16,361 --> 00:26:18,521
Practically had to be rebuilt
from the ground up.

463
00:26:18,681 --> 00:26:21,681
When I look at this painting,
I get very emotional.

464
00:26:22,721 --> 00:26:23,961
John.

465
00:26:24,121 --> 00:26:27,441
I think I need to avail myself
of one of the 35 bathrooms in here.

466
00:26:28,161 --> 00:26:29,721
There's a ladies' room downstairs.

467
00:26:29,881 --> 00:26:32,361
- Where? I'll take her.
- I can go by myself, John.

468
00:26:32,521 --> 00:26:33,681
I'm not a child.

469
00:26:33,841 --> 00:26:36,121
Hey, just don't touch anything
or wander off...

470
00:26:36,281 --> 00:26:38,721
...or talk to anybody
that you shouldn't be talking to.

471
00:26:38,881 --> 00:26:40,441
I make no promises.

472
00:26:41,041 --> 00:26:42,201
He's seven minutes behind.

473
00:26:42,361 --> 00:26:44,321
Sorry, he got hung up
on the State Floor.

474
00:26:44,481 --> 00:26:46,681
- Good morning, Margaret.
- Morning, Mr. President.

475
00:26:46,841 --> 00:26:49,001
Could you get the speaker
on the phone?

476
00:26:49,161 --> 00:26:50,161
Right away, sir.

477
00:26:50,321 --> 00:26:53,001
Have you and the missus zeroed in
on a dining establishment?

478
00:26:53,161 --> 00:26:55,561
When have you known the missus
to zero in on anything?

479
00:26:55,721 --> 00:26:57,201
Fair point, sir.

480
00:26:57,361 --> 00:26:59,561
Martin, I wanna shake your hand.

481
00:27:00,401 --> 00:27:02,961
- We're all sorry to see you go.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

482
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,921
And I know that you and Muriel
have had a tough go of it...

483
00:27:06,081 --> 00:27:08,641
- ...since Kevin passed, and...
- We all make sacrifices...

484
00:27:08,801 --> 00:27:11,041
- ...for our country, sir.
- Yeah, but it's more...

485
00:27:11,201 --> 00:27:13,041
I have the speaker of the house
for you.

486
00:27:14,241 --> 00:27:15,601
I'm sorry.

487
00:27:15,761 --> 00:27:17,281
Thank you, Mr. President.

488
00:27:19,841 --> 00:27:21,161
Right.

489
00:27:21,841 --> 00:27:24,281
- Thank you, Margaret.
- You're welcome, sir.

490
00:27:26,841 --> 00:27:29,281
- Eli.
- That was quite a speech, Mr. President.

491
00:27:29,441 --> 00:27:31,761
If you were on board,
we'd have a real shot at peace.

492
00:27:31,921 --> 00:27:35,121
You do know that your plan has upset
the entire defence industry.

493
00:27:35,281 --> 00:27:37,801
These are powerful people
who give money to both parties.

494
00:27:37,961 --> 00:27:41,121
I talked to President Al-Sharif again
about the discussion we had...

495
00:27:41,281 --> 00:27:43,721
...and he's assuring me
that he has proof.

496
00:27:43,881 --> 00:27:45,161
- And you believe him?
<i>- I do.</i>

497
00:27:45,321 --> 00:27:47,681
Guys that run those corporations
have been in bed...

498
00:27:47,841 --> 00:27:51,601
...with radical regimes for years. All they
wanna do is keep the cycle of war going.

499
00:27:51,761 --> 00:27:53,601
Al-Sharif will expose them.

500
00:27:53,761 --> 00:27:55,761
<i>All of that wrongdoing
is gonna come out...</i>

501
00:27:55,921 --> 00:27:59,121
<i>- ...as soon as our plan is signed.</i>
- Sir, if your plan is signed.

502
00:28:12,721 --> 00:28:13,841
Jesus.

503
00:28:14,881 --> 00:28:16,721
Since when do you guys
come through here?

504
00:28:17,281 --> 00:28:19,201
My supervisor told me
to come this way.

505
00:28:19,361 --> 00:28:20,801
Stop.

506
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:31,681
Be careful next time.

507
00:28:32,721 --> 00:28:35,921
<i>I know we've had our differences,
but I've never known you to be a man...</i>

508
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:38,801
<i>...to let politics stand in the way
of doing the right thing.</i>

509
00:28:38,961 --> 00:28:42,561
If you stand with me on this, you can be
the man that could take these guys down.

510
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:45,521
I'd like to drag every one of these
CEOs in front of Congress...

511
00:28:45,681 --> 00:28:49,041
...but there's more at stake here.
I can't support this, not at the risk...

512
00:28:49,201 --> 00:28:50,881
...of leaving us militarily exposed.

513
00:28:51,041 --> 00:28:53,161
Come on, you know
those bases are for show now.

514
00:28:53,321 --> 00:28:55,841
<i>We could launch a drone
off of any carrier in the gulf...</i>

515
00:28:56,001 --> 00:28:57,361
<i>...and hit any target we want.</i>

516
00:29:09,201 --> 00:29:10,281
Excuse me, miss.

517
00:29:10,441 --> 00:29:12,721
Sir, you can't leave that there.

518
00:29:12,881 --> 00:29:14,561
Hey, buddy!

519
00:29:18,161 --> 00:29:20,561
Twenty-four, I'm in the rotunda.
I got a maintenance...

520
00:29:38,321 --> 00:29:39,441
Eli, you all right?

521
00:29:39,601 --> 00:29:41,241
Keep moving, let's go, push.

522
00:29:41,401 --> 00:29:42,641
Get your security teams up.

523
00:29:44,401 --> 00:29:46,961
Mr. Speaker? Mr. Speaker?

524
00:29:47,121 --> 00:29:48,401
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

525
00:29:48,561 --> 00:29:50,401
We have to get out of here.
You follow me.

526
00:29:50,561 --> 00:29:52,561
- Where's the vice president?
- In the chamber.

527
00:29:52,721 --> 00:29:55,161
Tell him we need to institute
Continuity of Government.

528
00:29:55,321 --> 00:29:58,001
- I tried. He's been cut by some glass.
- Now stay close.

529
00:29:58,161 --> 00:29:59,441
Don't panic, take your time.

530
00:30:00,481 --> 00:30:03,121
There's been an explosion
at the Capitol building.

531
00:30:03,281 --> 00:30:05,121
- And?
- I'm crashing the White House.

532
00:30:05,281 --> 00:30:07,441
We're crashing the White House.
Get the CAT Team.

533
00:30:07,601 --> 00:30:09,041
I want all nonessentials evac'd.

534
00:30:09,201 --> 00:30:12,721
Get that hallway clear if we have to move.
Sergeant, bolt these doors.

535
00:30:12,881 --> 00:30:15,401
I need Marine 1 here
as fast as possible.

536
00:30:15,561 --> 00:30:17,881
Sir, I need you to move away
from the window, sir.

537
00:30:18,041 --> 00:30:19,161
Yeah.

538
00:30:20,481 --> 00:30:21,681
Lock down all these doors.

539
00:30:22,681 --> 00:30:24,281
- Do it quickly.
- Go, go, go!

540
00:30:24,441 --> 00:30:25,761
- Sir.
- The residence.

541
00:30:27,721 --> 00:30:28,721
Bear with us.

542
00:30:28,881 --> 00:30:30,841
Sir, we have a tour group
on the State Floor.

543
00:30:31,001 --> 00:30:33,041
Hold them in the Blue Room.
Maintain positions.

544
00:30:33,201 --> 00:30:34,561
Keep the hallways clear.

545
00:30:34,721 --> 00:30:37,281
- Everybody stay where you are.
- My daughter's downstairs.

546
00:30:37,441 --> 00:30:39,441
No one goes anywhere
till we lift the crash.

547
00:30:39,601 --> 00:30:42,761
- She's just a little girl. I gotta get her.
- Step away from the door.

548
00:30:46,561 --> 00:30:49,361
Keep moving, please. Everybody.

549
00:30:54,201 --> 00:30:56,921
Gentlemen, we're on lockdown.
You can't be in here.

550
00:30:57,081 --> 00:30:58,401
- Let's go.
- Sorry?

551
00:30:58,561 --> 00:31:00,201
- We're on lockdown!
- Can't hear you!

552
00:31:00,361 --> 00:31:04,241
You gotta be kidding me. Movie time
is over. Shut this down! Let's go.

553
00:31:07,041 --> 00:31:09,441
Bobby, sync watches, 60 seconds.
Silencer.

554
00:31:10,961 --> 00:31:12,361
Let's go.

555
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,121
<i>Yes, sir, that is correct, sir.</i>

556
00:31:15,281 --> 00:31:17,001
<i>- We are on full lockdown.</i>
- Hey!

557
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:29,161
We need help up here now!

558
00:31:38,641 --> 00:31:40,401
Security sweep! Open up!

559
00:31:44,681 --> 00:31:47,841
Thirty seconds. Secure Air Comm.
Meet at the rally.

560
00:31:54,481 --> 00:31:55,681
Armoury secure.

561
00:32:00,721 --> 00:32:02,881
All right, let's go. Let's move, move!

562
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:05,801
- Hold up. We're on full lockdown here.
- Hey!

563
00:32:17,721 --> 00:32:20,401
East Hall secure.
Heading for Castle Sky.

564
00:32:25,801 --> 00:32:29,281
<i>You've reached the voice mail of
Emily Cale. Why aren't you texting me?</i>

565
00:32:29,441 --> 00:32:31,681
Em, as soon as you get this,
call me back.

566
00:32:33,401 --> 00:32:36,561
- Keep moving, keep moving!
- Martin, I'm right outside the Capitol.

567
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:39,081
What the hell is happening?
Do you have the president?

568
00:32:39,241 --> 00:32:42,601
I have Eagle. Call WFO, get as
many men as you can to the Capitol.

569
00:32:42,761 --> 00:32:46,521
I'll dispatch everyone I can spare.
I want a hard perimeter around Castle.

570
00:32:46,681 --> 00:32:48,401
A hard perimeter around Castle.

571
00:32:48,561 --> 00:32:50,881
Eastside Gate.
Come on, let's go, people.

572
00:32:51,041 --> 00:32:52,521
Fred, open the gate.

573
00:32:54,441 --> 00:32:56,641
We're gonna be fine.
It's gonna be okay.

574
00:32:56,801 --> 00:32:58,761
- They're exiting the building.
- Keep moving!

575
00:32:58,921 --> 00:33:00,081
Castle South clear.

576
00:33:06,881 --> 00:33:08,121
Clear!

577
00:33:10,481 --> 00:33:11,881
We have Castle Sky.

578
00:33:20,001 --> 00:33:22,321
<i>Five agents in the East Gate,
four in the garden.</i>

579
00:33:22,481 --> 00:33:25,761
<i>The rest should be on the South Lawn.
And two policemen on the South Gate.</i>

580
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:28,001
<i>- Let's go.</i>
- Let's go! Keep moving!

581
00:33:31,161 --> 00:33:33,961
Shots fired. Code Black! Code Black!

582
00:33:34,121 --> 00:33:36,561
- Say again. Say again.
- He said "shots fired."

583
00:33:36,721 --> 00:33:39,121
Look, it's gotta be an AOP.
You gotta get out there.

584
00:33:39,281 --> 00:33:40,881
- Stand back.
- I'm not doing anything.

585
00:33:41,041 --> 00:33:42,241
You serious? Look around.

586
00:33:42,401 --> 00:33:44,081
- Stand back!
- The threat is out there!

587
00:33:44,241 --> 00:33:45,241
Go out and do your job!

588
00:33:45,401 --> 00:33:47,401
Donnie, where'd
you send my daughter?

589
00:33:47,561 --> 00:33:50,481
I'm sure she's fine.
We're in the safest house in the world.

590
00:33:50,641 --> 00:33:52,841
Well, not today, it's not.

591
00:33:53,001 --> 00:33:55,881
<i>- You've reached the voice mail...</i>
- Em, pick up the phone.

592
00:34:00,721 --> 00:34:02,321
Can't tell where it's coming from.

593
00:34:02,481 --> 00:34:04,121
I have no visual on him.

594
00:34:05,201 --> 00:34:07,561
Ten-four. Still have them on...?

595
00:34:07,721 --> 00:34:08,801
No.

596
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,761
- Clear!
- Clear!

597
00:34:28,721 --> 00:34:30,721
<i>Negative, negative.
Snipers on the roof.</i>

598
00:34:30,881 --> 00:34:34,321
<i>Do not approach Castle.
Repeat, do not approach Castle.</i>

599
00:34:34,481 --> 00:34:36,001
<i>Do not advance. Do not advance.</i>

600
00:34:54,641 --> 00:34:56,721
Say what?

601
00:34:56,881 --> 00:34:58,801
Welcome to the White House,
Mr. Tyler.

602
00:34:58,961 --> 00:35:02,001
I love what you've done with the place.
Bullet holes add to the decor.

603
00:35:03,121 --> 00:35:05,961
Did you see that shit Conrad pulled off
at the Capitol? Goddamn!

604
00:35:06,121 --> 00:35:08,241
Let's keep it tight. Get to work.

605
00:35:08,881 --> 00:35:11,081
Where are my goddamn hostages?

606
00:35:12,521 --> 00:35:13,921
- Dad?
<i>- Oh, thank God.</i>

607
00:35:14,081 --> 00:35:15,361
<i>- Emily, are you okay?</i>
- Dad...

608
00:35:15,521 --> 00:35:17,961
<i>Look, it's gonna be okay,
baby, I promise you.</i>

609
00:35:18,121 --> 00:35:20,561
- Where are you?
- Where are you at? I'll come get you.

610
00:35:26,241 --> 00:35:28,281
Where'd you send my daughter?

611
00:35:28,441 --> 00:35:31,041
Downstairs. Across the hall,
second on the left.

612
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:34,201
Shut up!

613
00:36:04,681 --> 00:36:06,921
Find him. Go!

614
00:36:08,401 --> 00:36:11,241
- What's going on?
- What? I got it.

615
00:36:11,761 --> 00:36:13,041
You better.

616
00:36:15,041 --> 00:36:17,681
<i>Castle, this is Hummingbird.
We are on final approach.</i>

617
00:36:20,121 --> 00:36:23,401
- What are we waiting for, Martin?
- Marine 1 is three minutes out, sir.

618
00:36:25,281 --> 00:36:27,601
Castle, does anybody copy?
I repeat, we are...

619
00:36:30,961 --> 00:36:34,641
Break right! Break right!
We are taking fire. Castle has fallen.

620
00:36:34,801 --> 00:36:37,361
<i>The White House is down.
Heavy weapons on the roof.</i>

621
00:36:37,521 --> 00:36:39,841
- Take him to the PEOC.
- They're in the building.

622
00:36:40,001 --> 00:36:41,761
- We need to exfilt...
- I got this!

623
00:36:41,921 --> 00:36:45,361
Mr. President, Mr. President,
I get you to the vault...

624
00:36:45,521 --> 00:36:46,801
...their game is over.

625
00:36:46,961 --> 00:36:49,201
You sure you can get me there?

626
00:36:49,361 --> 00:36:51,521
Yes, sir. I am.

627
00:36:52,441 --> 00:36:53,561
Then get me to the vault.

628
00:36:53,721 --> 00:36:57,201
Diamond formation. Stay low,
stay close, shoot first. Got it? On me.

629
00:37:02,681 --> 00:37:04,161
Do you have the vice president?

630
00:37:04,321 --> 00:37:06,681
<i>- I repeat, do you have the vice president?</i>
- We do.

631
00:37:06,841 --> 00:37:09,041
- We're two miles away from Andrews.
- The speaker?

632
00:37:09,201 --> 00:37:11,361
Negative. We do not have the speaker.

633
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:13,801
- Please evacuate the Capitol.
- This way. Excuse me.

634
00:37:13,961 --> 00:37:14,961
Kellerman!

635
00:37:15,121 --> 00:37:17,001
Carol, COD says
we go to the Pentagon.

636
00:37:17,161 --> 00:37:19,441
I have the speaker.
Going to the secondary location.

637
00:37:19,601 --> 00:37:21,561
Watch yourself.
Excuse me, ma'am.

638
00:37:24,161 --> 00:37:26,481
Downstairs, second door to the left.

639
00:37:32,401 --> 00:37:33,681
Emily.

640
00:37:50,441 --> 00:37:53,121
No, no, no, please. Please don't!
I was just on the tour!

641
00:37:53,281 --> 00:37:55,281
- You had a gun!
- It's a phone, it's a phone.

642
00:37:55,441 --> 00:37:58,121
- I swear. Look, I got a daughter. Please.
- Get up!

643
00:37:58,281 --> 00:37:59,521
Okay.

644
00:38:06,161 --> 00:38:08,081
That was close.

645
00:38:08,241 --> 00:38:09,921
Shit.

646
00:38:10,081 --> 00:38:12,161
You think you're tough, bitch?

647
00:38:17,241 --> 00:38:19,761
<i>Keep the ground floor clear.
Package is on the move.</i>

648
00:38:24,241 --> 00:38:26,881
Eagle is 30 seconds from the vault.
We are coming in hot.

649
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:29,761
<i>Copy that, sir.
Eagle is 30 seconds from the vault.</i>

650
00:38:30,081 --> 00:38:31,841
Go, go!

651
00:38:34,761 --> 00:38:37,801
Mr. President. Glasses.

652
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:41,361
Match. We're in. Go!

653
00:38:43,361 --> 00:38:45,841
Go ahead. I'll button this up.
Go ahead.

654
00:38:48,281 --> 00:38:50,281
<i>Mr. Vice President,
I apologise in advance...</i>

655
00:38:50,441 --> 00:38:53,121
<i>...but this is gonna be the hardest takeoff
you've ever felt.</i>

656
00:38:53,281 --> 00:38:55,721
<i>We're gonna put this bird
at 30,000 feet in 45 seconds.</i>

657
00:39:03,961 --> 00:39:06,321
James William Sawyer.

658
00:39:11,361 --> 00:39:14,081
Gentlemen. What are you doing?!

659
00:39:15,041 --> 00:39:17,121
Please, Martin, what are you doing?

660
00:39:18,601 --> 00:39:20,401
I'm sorry, Ted.

661
00:39:21,761 --> 00:39:25,001
- Martin!
- Consider this my resignation.

662
00:39:25,161 --> 00:39:28,361
Emily? Where are you at, baby?

663
00:39:28,521 --> 00:39:30,841
Please tell me you got out of here.

664
00:39:31,961 --> 00:39:34,961
Mr. Stenz. We're in.

665
00:39:35,121 --> 00:39:36,401
I have the package.

666
00:39:37,201 --> 00:39:41,161
<i>Ground floor, through the library
and down the stairs.</i>

667
00:39:41,321 --> 00:39:44,521
<i>- The library. We're on our way.
- We'll be waiting for you.</i>

668
00:39:50,241 --> 00:39:52,121
That's the library.

669
00:39:53,161 --> 00:39:56,561
Don't go in there. Just...
Oh, this is so stupid.

670
00:39:58,561 --> 00:40:00,241
You're not gonna get away with this.

671
00:40:00,401 --> 00:40:01,841
Martin! What are you doing?

672
00:40:02,001 --> 00:40:05,521
No, Mr. President. The question is,
what are you gonna do?

673
00:40:05,681 --> 00:40:08,241
Gonna shake my hand again?
Give a little speech?

674
00:40:08,961 --> 00:40:10,921
Is this about Kevin? Look, I'm sorry...

675
00:40:12,801 --> 00:40:14,801
Run, Mr. President!
To me, to me, to me!

676
00:40:20,121 --> 00:40:21,841
Move!

677
00:40:22,001 --> 00:40:23,201
<i>Walker.</i>

678
00:40:24,361 --> 00:40:25,641
Move, move, move!

679
00:40:27,641 --> 00:40:29,561
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

680
00:40:31,321 --> 00:40:33,921
- Stand behind me and do what I say.
- Walker, I say again...

681
00:40:34,081 --> 00:40:36,401
...we are coming to you,
we are on the move.

682
00:40:39,761 --> 00:40:40,881
In the library.

683
00:40:41,041 --> 00:40:42,921
- Shit. I'm empty.
- Walker!

684
00:40:47,401 --> 00:40:48,721
Run, run, run!

685
00:40:50,441 --> 00:40:51,441
Stenz!

686
00:40:52,081 --> 00:40:53,681
No, not that way! They're up there!

687
00:40:59,001 --> 00:41:00,401
Goddamn!

688
00:41:00,561 --> 00:41:02,761
<i>We've lost the package.
Secure the exits.</i>

689
00:41:02,921 --> 00:41:04,481
- Which Way's this go?
- West Wing.

690
00:41:07,601 --> 00:41:09,521
Run, Mr. President! Move! Move!

691
00:41:12,681 --> 00:41:13,881
This leads to the basement.

692
00:41:14,041 --> 00:41:16,681
<i>- We're in the stairwell, coming your way.</i>
- Shit.

693
00:41:24,361 --> 00:41:25,801
We gotta go!

694
00:41:27,281 --> 00:41:28,961
Elevator's here, let's go!

695
00:41:33,681 --> 00:41:36,321
Shit! God!
They're in the elevator heading up!

696
00:41:36,481 --> 00:41:39,441
- Cut them off in the Central Hall!
- What are you doing? Get him!

697
00:41:39,601 --> 00:41:40,721
Take care of Bobby.

698
00:41:43,721 --> 00:41:46,321
<i>- Killick, stop them at the elevator.</i>
- I'm on it.

699
00:41:48,721 --> 00:41:51,041
He's in the residence!
Cut him off at the residence!

700
00:41:51,761 --> 00:41:53,601
Son of a bitch!
You screwed us, Walker.

701
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,681
You've got one of your guys
running around.

702
00:41:55,841 --> 00:41:57,601
- Not one of my guys.
- Then who is he?

703
00:41:57,761 --> 00:42:00,401
I don't know, probably some schmuck
from one of the tours.

704
00:42:00,561 --> 00:42:03,881
Your tourist killed one of my best men!
So now I'm gonna take care of it!

705
00:42:04,041 --> 00:42:07,081
No, you will not.
You will have your boys...

706
00:42:07,241 --> 00:42:09,001
...sweep every room in this place.

707
00:42:09,161 --> 00:42:11,921
And you will come with me,
as planned.

708
00:42:13,641 --> 00:42:14,961
Find him.

709
00:42:18,881 --> 00:42:21,041
You don't talk to me like that
in front of my men.

710
00:42:21,201 --> 00:42:22,481
- I don't, huh?
- No, you don't!

711
00:42:22,641 --> 00:42:23,921
Ten years I've known Bobby!

712
00:42:24,081 --> 00:42:26,721
Twice the guy saved my life.
This doesn't go unanswered!

713
00:42:26,881 --> 00:42:28,801
Drop the tough-guy shit
with me, junior.

714
00:42:28,961 --> 00:42:30,321
Now, I know your story, Emil.

715
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:32,201
I know what this country did to you.

716
00:42:32,361 --> 00:42:34,601
We're in this together. So be calm.

717
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:35,961
- I'm calm.
- Good.

718
00:42:36,121 --> 00:42:38,881
- I'm still gonna kill him.
- I don't have a problem with that.

719
00:42:39,041 --> 00:42:42,241
But I need the president alive.
Don't forget that.

720
00:42:52,881 --> 00:42:54,881
You promised me the leader
of the free world.

721
00:42:55,041 --> 00:42:57,921
Don't you worry your pretty little head.
We'll get him back.

722
00:42:58,081 --> 00:43:00,721
But without him, what kind
of time frame we looking at?

723
00:43:00,881 --> 00:43:03,601
We have 15 minutes to load in,
then maybe another 30 or so...

724
00:43:03,761 --> 00:43:06,761
...to crack the protocols without his code.
After that, it's on you.

725
00:43:06,921 --> 00:43:10,121
- What about securing the basement?
- I brought a party favour for that.

726
00:43:10,281 --> 00:43:11,721
- Good.
- Do you know...

727
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:15,041
...you've got a bit of something right...
It's right under your nose.

728
00:43:30,521 --> 00:43:32,081
Vadim.

729
00:43:33,201 --> 00:43:35,441
You let me know the second
you find these guys.

730
00:43:35,601 --> 00:43:36,921
<i>Copy that.</i>

731
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:39,921
Somebody please shut the alarm off!

732
00:43:41,721 --> 00:43:43,241
I got work to do.

733
00:43:44,401 --> 00:43:46,001
Motts.

734
00:43:46,161 --> 00:43:48,521
Take Bobby's place in Air Comm.

735
00:43:50,641 --> 00:43:51,761
I'll show you the way.

736
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:54,001
We got some important people
waiting for us.

737
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:00,721
- Are you okay, sir?
- I'm all right.

738
00:44:00,881 --> 00:44:03,761
- Is your family in the complex?
- They won't be here till tonight.

739
00:44:03,921 --> 00:44:06,801
- Your daughter, where's your daughter?
- I couldn't find her.

740
00:44:06,961 --> 00:44:08,681
I hope she got out.

741
00:44:08,841 --> 00:44:10,121
Do you know these men?

742
00:44:10,281 --> 00:44:12,921
That old son of a bitch,
his name is Martin Walker.

743
00:44:13,081 --> 00:44:14,961
He's the head of my Secret Service.

744
00:44:15,121 --> 00:44:18,681
You should have a conversation about
how serious you take your protection.

745
00:44:18,841 --> 00:44:21,401
- I didn't pick him.
- Why is he doing this?

746
00:44:21,561 --> 00:44:24,241
I think it has something to do
with his son Kevin.

747
00:44:24,401 --> 00:44:26,161
- Why? What happened?
- He was a Marine.

748
00:44:26,321 --> 00:44:29,921
He got killed last year
in this covert action that I ordered.

749
00:44:30,081 --> 00:44:33,761
Would he do this for a personal
vendetta? He said he wanted you alive.

750
00:44:34,361 --> 00:44:36,481
There's gotta be a bigger play.

751
00:44:36,881 --> 00:44:39,841
We gotta get out
of this elevator shaft.

752
00:44:40,001 --> 00:44:41,361
I'm...

753
00:44:41,521 --> 00:44:43,281
Don't tell me you're claustrophobic.

754
00:44:49,601 --> 00:44:51,921
Oh, my God.
The FAA needs to ground all air traffic.

755
00:44:52,081 --> 00:44:53,961
Where's the secretary
of Homeland Security?

756
00:44:54,121 --> 00:44:56,841
- He's at the White House.
- Who's the deputy sec?

757
00:44:57,001 --> 00:45:00,201
Wyck Halsey.
He's also at the White House.

758
00:45:00,361 --> 00:45:02,081
Oh, Jesus.

759
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:05,321
<i>...happens,
our thoughts go to terrorism.</i>

760
00:45:05,881 --> 00:45:07,481
I've had enough of this.

761
00:45:07,641 --> 00:45:09,441
Walker told us to stay where we are.

762
00:45:10,881 --> 00:45:12,881
Madam Secretary, gentlemen...

763
00:45:13,041 --> 00:45:15,441
...I'm gonna ask you to accompany us
to the Blue Room.

764
00:45:15,601 --> 00:45:17,921
- Who is this man?
- He is...

765
00:45:18,081 --> 00:45:20,681
- He's a concerned citizen.
- Good morning, Mr. Secretary.

766
00:45:25,241 --> 00:45:28,881
- You killed the secretary of defence.
- Well, he wasn't doing a very good job.

767
00:45:29,041 --> 00:45:31,121
Okay, so,
would the remaining secretaries...

768
00:45:31,281 --> 00:45:33,401
...please join us in the Blue Room?

769
00:45:36,601 --> 00:45:38,641
- Sir, I'm on with Agent Reid.
- How they doing?

770
00:45:38,801 --> 00:45:40,441
VP just puked all over Air Force One.

771
00:45:40,601 --> 00:45:43,281
I'm General Caulfield,
vice chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff.

772
00:45:43,441 --> 00:45:45,361
Have the nuclear launch codes
been switched?

773
00:45:45,521 --> 00:45:48,401
- Yes, and new codes are active.
- The stock market's collapsing.

774
00:45:49,041 --> 00:45:51,601
Travis, I need you
to suspend trading immediately.

775
00:45:51,761 --> 00:45:54,801
And there's gonna be a run on the banks,
so close them now.

776
00:46:03,841 --> 00:46:05,201
- You guys good?
- Yes, sir.

777
00:46:05,361 --> 00:46:06,801
Don't mess it up.

778
00:46:09,441 --> 00:46:10,481
Son of a...

779
00:46:10,641 --> 00:46:12,081
Captain, where are we?

780
00:46:12,241 --> 00:46:15,281
We have reason to believe
that the explosive was a diversion.

781
00:46:15,441 --> 00:46:16,481
Diversion from what?

782
00:46:16,641 --> 00:46:18,721
An armed team
has taken over the White House.

783
00:46:18,881 --> 00:46:20,041
Do we have the president?

784
00:46:20,201 --> 00:46:22,121
I spoke to Walker.
He had eyes on Eagle.

785
00:46:22,281 --> 00:46:23,841
Fifteen minutes is a lifetime.

786
00:46:24,001 --> 00:46:27,201
Radio chatter indicated they were headed
for the PEOC. No contact.

787
00:46:27,361 --> 00:46:29,641
We have to assume
they've been compromised.

788
00:46:29,801 --> 00:46:31,521
We gotta get you to a phone.

789
00:46:31,681 --> 00:46:33,561
Call SEAL Team Six
and they come in here...

790
00:46:33,721 --> 00:46:35,881
...and they'll shoot these assholes
in the head.

791
00:46:36,041 --> 00:46:39,281
- We keep a satphone in the residence.
- Great. Where's that at?

792
00:46:41,121 --> 00:46:42,801
Of course it is.

793
00:46:42,961 --> 00:46:45,081
- You ever been rock climbing?
- We climbing this?

794
00:46:45,241 --> 00:46:47,361
Unless you got a better idea, yeah.

795
00:46:47,521 --> 00:46:49,601
No, I don't.

796
00:46:49,761 --> 00:46:52,721
By the way, John Cale.

797
00:46:53,681 --> 00:46:55,721
- James Sawyer.
- I'll get you out of here, sir.

798
00:46:55,881 --> 00:46:57,361
Just follow me up.

799
00:46:58,841 --> 00:47:01,321
Yeah, I'm right behind you.

800
00:47:01,801 --> 00:47:03,361
Make sure you have one handhold...

801
00:47:03,521 --> 00:47:06,641
- ...before you let go of the other one.
- Whatever you do, I'll do.

802
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:12,201
I ain't doing that shit.

803
00:47:15,241 --> 00:47:18,881
The scene here at the White House
is getting more chaotic every second.

804
00:47:19,041 --> 00:47:20,361
We have got hundreds...

805
00:47:20,521 --> 00:47:23,281
As you can see,
the military's moving into position...

806
00:47:23,441 --> 00:47:26,801
...but won't advance because of
safety concerns for the hostages.

807
00:47:26,961 --> 00:47:29,601
<i>...obvious to everyone,
this is the work of al Qaeda...</i>

808
00:47:29,761 --> 00:47:32,401
<i>...or some like-minded
Arab terrorist group.</i>

809
00:47:32,561 --> 00:47:34,961
<i>- The National Guard...</i>
- The building's buttoned up.

810
00:47:35,121 --> 00:47:36,401
Rooftop's secure.

811
00:47:36,561 --> 00:47:39,201
- They attempted contact yet?
- Not yet.

812
00:47:39,361 --> 00:47:41,761
- Apparently, we're all Arabs.
- Good.

813
00:47:41,921 --> 00:47:43,481
- Cake?
- No, I don't want cake.

814
00:47:43,641 --> 00:47:45,201
I'm diabetic.

815
00:47:50,001 --> 00:47:51,641
Hallelujah.

816
00:47:54,441 --> 00:47:56,841
This is my Graceland!

817
00:48:05,121 --> 00:48:06,321
Sweet Shiva.

818
00:48:06,481 --> 00:48:08,881
Sugary pops of delight.

819
00:48:15,801 --> 00:48:18,321
Come on, let's go! Move!

820
00:48:19,201 --> 00:48:22,561
Let's go, sheeple.
Now, welcome to my house.

821
00:48:22,721 --> 00:48:24,721
Now, sit down and shut up!

822
00:48:24,881 --> 00:48:26,641
Oh, baby, I've missed you.

823
00:48:28,561 --> 00:48:32,001
Let's get you plugged in.
You fit in nicely right there.

824
00:48:34,081 --> 00:48:36,201
Ladies and gentlemen,
Skip Tyler has arrived.

825
00:48:36,361 --> 00:48:39,881
By the time you're watching this,
I will have pulled off the greatest hack...

826
00:48:40,041 --> 00:48:42,841
...the world has ever seen.
This is difficult for some, it is...

827
00:48:43,001 --> 00:48:47,921
...but for me, it's as easy as
one, two, three...

828
00:48:48,081 --> 00:48:51,681
...four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

829
00:48:56,361 --> 00:48:59,041
Yes.

830
00:49:02,881 --> 00:49:04,081
Showtime!

831
00:49:14,001 --> 00:49:17,521
Oh, some latecomers.
Secretary of Homeland Security...

832
00:49:17,681 --> 00:49:20,921
...is in the house!
You're so getting fired for this.

833
00:49:21,081 --> 00:49:24,561
- Look who was hiding in the Press Room.
- Oh, my God, Roger Skinner!

834
00:49:24,721 --> 00:49:28,401
The only one who speaks the truth.
I love your show. Seriously.

835
00:49:28,561 --> 00:49:31,601
After you, please. Get in there.

836
00:49:59,681 --> 00:50:01,961
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

837
00:50:04,361 --> 00:50:07,161
Playing some hide-and-seek, little girl?

838
00:50:07,321 --> 00:50:11,761
Well, then, I will huff, and I will puff...

839
00:50:11,921 --> 00:50:14,281
...and I'm gonna blow your house down.

840
00:50:24,041 --> 00:50:27,401
- No, no, no! Leave me alone.
- Get in here.

841
00:50:27,561 --> 00:50:29,441
- Move!
- Mr. Skinner, please stop crying.

842
00:50:29,601 --> 00:50:31,521
Get comfortable, you little mutt.

843
00:50:33,521 --> 00:50:35,241
Are you okay?

844
00:50:36,961 --> 00:50:39,841
- Oh, my God, where's my dad?
- He went looking for you.

845
00:50:45,841 --> 00:50:47,521
Excuse me for a second.

846
00:50:52,401 --> 00:50:53,841
Sir?

847
00:50:54,001 --> 00:50:55,481
Hi.

848
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:59,281
I understand that this is
a very high-stress time...

849
00:50:59,441 --> 00:51:02,921
...but if you and your colleagues...

850
00:51:03,081 --> 00:51:05,001
...could maybe be
a little more careful...

851
00:51:05,161 --> 00:51:08,161
...with the priceless artefacts
that are in this building...

852
00:51:08,321 --> 00:51:12,161
...because I mean, it is a living history...
Okay, because see...

853
00:51:12,321 --> 00:51:14,481
...that was a Ming Dynasty
16th-century vase...

854
00:51:14,641 --> 00:51:17,841
...that was a gift from
Queen Elizabeth II. It's irreplaceable.

855
00:51:21,361 --> 00:51:25,041
I'll go sit down. I'm gonna... I'll be over
here if you have any more questions.

856
00:51:25,201 --> 00:51:26,921
<i>Vadim, Chen, report.</i>

857
00:51:27,081 --> 00:51:30,281
We're done with the residence, boss.
Coming up to the third floor.

858
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:39,001
Shit.

859
00:51:41,361 --> 00:51:42,921
Okay, I'm coming up.

860
00:52:00,001 --> 00:52:01,481
Get your head down!

861
00:52:18,241 --> 00:52:19,841
What are you doing?

862
00:52:20,001 --> 00:52:23,121
- Trying to shoot off the cables?
- I heard something.

863
00:52:23,281 --> 00:52:26,361
Come on. That thing's 100 years old.
The shit's too heavy for it.

864
00:52:26,521 --> 00:52:28,401
Let's unload before it snaps.

865
00:52:32,881 --> 00:52:35,601
- Jesus, they have Javelins.
- Javelin what?

866
00:52:35,761 --> 00:52:37,321
Surface-to-air missiles.

867
00:52:37,481 --> 00:52:39,881
If anybody comes in by air,
they're done.

868
00:52:40,041 --> 00:52:42,161
Mr. Speaker,
I have the vice president for you.

869
00:52:42,321 --> 00:52:43,601
- Alvin, you okay?
<i>- I'm fine.</i>

870
00:52:43,761 --> 00:52:45,201
<i>Who's in command on the ground?</i>

871
00:52:45,361 --> 00:52:47,121
- Well...
- Permission to speak freely.

872
00:52:47,281 --> 00:52:49,321
<i>- Yeah, yeah, granted.</i>
- It's a shit show.

873
00:52:49,481 --> 00:52:52,401
D.C. police are on the scene,
FBI is trying to horn in...

874
00:52:52,561 --> 00:52:54,881
...plus Secret Service feels it
should be their show.

875
00:52:55,041 --> 00:52:57,961
It should. Carol Finnerty,
Secret Service.

876
00:52:58,121 --> 00:53:00,561
Mr. Vice President,
it was our building that was taken.

877
00:53:00,721 --> 00:53:03,441
Yes, it was, and now
you're standing in our building.

878
00:53:03,601 --> 00:53:06,641
<i>We need to send the Army in there
and take the White House back.</i>

879
00:53:06,801 --> 00:53:10,161
I don't think you can. Posse
Comitatus and the Insurrection Act...

880
00:53:10,321 --> 00:53:13,281
...make it very difficult to deploy
combat troops on American soil.

881
00:53:13,441 --> 00:53:16,041
Which is why we federalized
the National Guard minutes ago.

882
00:53:16,201 --> 00:53:18,801
Sir, with respect,
only the president can do that.

883
00:53:18,961 --> 00:53:21,601
Alvin, we're in
a constitutional crisis here.

884
00:53:21,761 --> 00:53:23,601
We've never had
a missing chief executive.

885
00:53:23,761 --> 00:53:26,321
<i>We're gonna have to start talking
about the 25th Amendment.</i>

886
00:53:26,481 --> 00:53:28,521
You wanna remove the president
from power?

887
00:53:28,681 --> 00:53:31,281
<i>I don't wanna do anything,
but I can't sit here...</i>

888
00:53:31,441 --> 00:53:33,961
<i>...and watch the government come
crashing down around us.</i>

889
00:53:34,121 --> 00:53:36,041
We've tried them on the phone
by now, right?

890
00:53:36,201 --> 00:53:37,321
Who?

891
00:53:49,841 --> 00:53:50,801
Hello?

892
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:54,801
Hello, this is Special Agent Carol
Finnerty. To whom am I speaking?

893
00:53:54,961 --> 00:53:58,801
That sounds official. Please hold.
Your call's very important to us.

894
00:54:01,041 --> 00:54:03,561
<i>- We've got an incoming call.</i>
- About time.

895
00:54:05,201 --> 00:54:06,721
Put them through.

896
00:54:09,401 --> 00:54:11,481
Thank you for holding.
I'll patch you through.

897
00:54:11,641 --> 00:54:13,361
Have a great day.

898
00:54:13,521 --> 00:54:16,401
Hello, this is Carol Finnerty.
Who is this?

899
00:54:16,561 --> 00:54:18,721
It's me, Carol.
You should've called already.

900
00:54:18,881 --> 00:54:21,281
- Martin.
<i>- We've held the building for 15 minutes.</i>

901
00:54:21,441 --> 00:54:23,401
- "We"?
- I'm sure you're recording this...

902
00:54:23,561 --> 00:54:26,761
...so let's make this easy on everybody.
My name is Martin James Walker.

903
00:54:26,921 --> 00:54:29,521
<i>Chief of the presidential detail
of the Secret Service.</i>

904
00:54:29,681 --> 00:54:32,721
My men currently control the
White House and the 61 hostages within.

905
00:54:32,881 --> 00:54:35,041
- What are you doing?
- I did you the courtesy...

906
00:54:35,201 --> 00:54:38,441
...of sending you out of here,
so let's just keep it professional, okay?

907
00:54:38,601 --> 00:54:40,321
"Professional"?

908
00:54:40,481 --> 00:54:42,841
You killed your own men.

909
00:54:43,401 --> 00:54:45,081
Where's Ted?

910
00:54:45,241 --> 00:54:46,921
Killing Ted Hope...

911
00:54:47,881 --> 00:54:50,801
...was the second hardest thing
I've ever had to do in my life.

912
00:54:54,801 --> 00:54:56,641
Martin, I want you to...

913
00:54:56,801 --> 00:54:59,641
There's not a thing you're about to say
that I didn't teach you.

914
00:54:59,801 --> 00:55:03,481
So we're gonna get all this done in
two hours and be done by lunch, okay?

915
00:55:03,641 --> 00:55:05,801
Now, ask me what I want.

916
00:55:06,961 --> 00:55:09,001
- What do you want?
<i>- On any given day...</i>

917
00:55:09,161 --> 00:55:13,841
...the United States Federal Reserve
holds in excess of $400 million in cash.

918
00:55:14,001 --> 00:55:16,881
And I want it loaded aboard
a Boeing C-17...

919
00:55:17,041 --> 00:55:20,881
...which you will leave fuelled and
otherwise empty on runway one-niner.

920
00:55:21,041 --> 00:55:24,081
I'd like to know how you plan
on getting from the White House...

921
00:55:24,241 --> 00:55:26,161
...to Reagan National
without being killed.

922
00:55:26,321 --> 00:55:29,481
We have eyes in the sky.
If I see a single sniper...

923
00:55:29,641 --> 00:55:33,281
...within 10 miles of this place,
I am going to kill...

924
00:55:33,441 --> 00:55:34,721
<i>...four Cabinet members...</i>

925
00:55:34,881 --> 00:55:37,361
<i>...and in a particularly nice
touch of irony...</i>

926
00:55:37,521 --> 00:55:40,241
...the director
of Homeland Security himself.

927
00:55:40,401 --> 00:55:42,001
Is President Sawyer alive?

928
00:55:44,641 --> 00:55:47,121
- Yes.
- I want proof of life.

929
00:55:47,281 --> 00:55:50,241
You got two hours
or I will execute him myself...

930
00:55:50,401 --> 00:55:52,881
...on the South Lawn
of the White House.

931
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:57,201
<i>Jesus, the head of his own detail.</i>

932
00:55:57,361 --> 00:55:59,281
At least we know
how they got in so easily.

933
00:55:59,441 --> 00:56:01,761
Can we be sure he's the only
Secret Service member...

934
00:56:01,921 --> 00:56:04,481
- ...who's been compromised?
- Oh, go to hell.

935
00:56:04,641 --> 00:56:05,641
Proof of life, huh?

936
00:56:05,801 --> 00:56:08,521
You say you can do better
than your men. Here's your chance.

937
00:56:08,681 --> 00:56:10,761
- Find him.
- With pleasure.

938
00:56:11,761 --> 00:56:14,801
Walker's wife, Muriel, is in Fairfax.

939
00:56:14,961 --> 00:56:16,521
Could you find her, please?

940
00:56:18,361 --> 00:56:19,601
You okay?

941
00:56:19,761 --> 00:56:21,961
I have Thanksgiving
at their house every year.

942
00:56:22,121 --> 00:56:24,561
I wanna run the whole search again,
from the top.

943
00:56:24,721 --> 00:56:27,401
Motts, meet me on the ground floor.
Chen, Vadim, the third.

944
00:56:27,561 --> 00:56:28,561
<i>Meet in the middle.</i>

945
00:56:28,721 --> 00:56:31,721
Roger that. I'm taking the stairs.
Mulcahy, finish up.

946
00:56:31,881 --> 00:56:32,921
That was the last one.

947
00:56:33,081 --> 00:56:34,801
Wait, so you said Walker's son died?

948
00:56:34,961 --> 00:56:38,641
The Pentagon thought that Iran
had a nuclear bomb. We sent a team in.

949
00:56:38,801 --> 00:56:41,041
Things went wrong.
Martin's son Kevin got killed.

950
00:56:41,201 --> 00:56:44,121
- You're telling me this is personal?
- He's not doing it by himself.

951
00:56:44,281 --> 00:56:46,041
- Someone else is footing the bill.
- Who?

952
00:56:46,201 --> 00:56:48,001
Heard of
the military-industrial complex?

953
00:56:48,161 --> 00:56:50,041
Those are the manufacturers
of the weapons.

954
00:56:50,201 --> 00:56:54,321
They think they own the system and
they will do anything to keep that power.

955
00:56:54,801 --> 00:56:56,321
They profit off of your sacrifice.

956
00:56:56,481 --> 00:56:58,801
Politicians always love
talking about sacrifice.

957
00:56:58,961 --> 00:57:01,121
Think I don't know anything
about sacrifice?

958
00:57:01,281 --> 00:57:03,641
How many people come to your house
and wanna kill you?

959
00:57:03,801 --> 00:57:05,761
Missiles are topside.

960
00:57:08,081 --> 00:57:09,961
Elevator going down to one.

961
00:57:14,001 --> 00:57:16,401
- We gotta get off on the second floor.
- What?

962
00:57:16,561 --> 00:57:18,081
Get off, get off, get off.

963
00:57:18,961 --> 00:57:21,761
- You all right? You see anybody?
- No, we're clear.

964
00:57:21,921 --> 00:57:23,361
Kick it in. Harder.

965
00:57:28,241 --> 00:57:29,841
Mr. President, stay on my hip.

966
00:57:31,521 --> 00:57:34,521
I got three rounds. Tell me you got
some weapons in the residence.

967
00:57:34,681 --> 00:57:37,441
No, we usually have two agents
right there with machine guns.

968
00:57:37,601 --> 00:57:39,441
- We got some knives in the kitchen.
- What?

969
00:57:39,601 --> 00:57:40,561
They're big knives.

970
00:57:40,721 --> 00:57:42,961
Great, then you can
make me a sandwich.

971
00:57:43,121 --> 00:57:44,961
Now, where's the phone?

972
00:57:51,041 --> 00:57:52,201
Right here.

973
00:57:52,361 --> 00:57:55,241
Walker set this number up.
Wait a minute, he's gonna trace it.

974
00:57:55,401 --> 00:57:57,761
We gotta get in touch
with somebody on the outside.

975
00:57:57,921 --> 00:57:59,441
- I got somebody.
- You got somebody?

976
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:01,641
- Yeah, yeah.
- I need to get my shoes.

977
00:58:18,321 --> 00:58:20,241
Needed this.

978
00:58:26,161 --> 00:58:28,321
- Hello?
- Jenna, this is John Cale.

979
00:58:28,481 --> 00:58:30,881
John, not a good time.

980
00:58:31,041 --> 00:58:32,401
Wait, wait, hold on a second.

981
00:58:32,561 --> 00:58:35,681
- Close friend?
- She works for the vice president.

982
00:58:36,881 --> 00:58:39,361
Have you heard what's happening?
It's not a good time.

983
00:58:39,521 --> 00:58:42,121
I'm with the president.
We're in the White House.

984
00:58:42,281 --> 00:58:45,041
- That's not funny, John.
- Does this sound like a joke to you?

985
00:58:45,201 --> 00:58:47,761
- Yeah, he's...
- Jenna, this is James Sawyer.

986
00:58:47,921 --> 00:58:51,201
<i>For the past 10 minutes, I've been
getting shot at with this young man.</i>

987
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:54,681
If you could connect me to whatever
control structure we still have left...

988
00:58:54,841 --> 00:58:56,921
...I would really appreciate it.
- Hold on.

989
00:58:57,081 --> 00:58:59,601
Hello? Thank you.

990
00:59:00,441 --> 00:59:01,761
She hung up?

991
00:59:03,561 --> 00:59:06,281
She put me on hold
when I was thanking her.

992
00:59:07,641 --> 00:59:11,921
So we wait for your best friend Jenna
to hit us back.

993
00:59:16,641 --> 00:59:18,081
You smoke?

994
00:59:19,721 --> 00:59:21,281
Neither do I.

995
00:59:23,761 --> 00:59:25,041
This is your moment, sir.

996
00:59:25,201 --> 00:59:28,321
The country is looking for a leader.
It's your time to step up.

997
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:30,241
I told you, we weren't to be disturbed.

998
00:59:30,401 --> 00:59:32,561
The president of the United States
called my cell.

999
00:59:32,721 --> 00:59:34,841
<i>- Mr. President.
- It's about damn time.</i>

1000
00:59:35,001 --> 00:59:37,441
<i>- Mr. President, are you all right?</i>
- We're safe.

1001
00:59:37,601 --> 00:59:39,201
- "We"?
- Yeah, I'm with someone.

1002
00:59:39,361 --> 00:59:40,841
I'm gonna put him on the phone.

1003
00:59:41,001 --> 00:59:42,641
- Hello, this is John Cale.
- Cale?

1004
00:59:42,801 --> 00:59:44,521
What are you doing
in the White House?

1005
00:59:44,681 --> 00:59:47,481
- He's doing a damn good job.
- It's a long story, Mr. Speaker...

1006
00:59:47,641 --> 00:59:50,721
...but look, they've taken the building
and they're holding hostages.

1007
00:59:50,881 --> 00:59:53,321
- This is when you come get us.
- We're doing our best.

1008
00:59:53,481 --> 00:59:56,721
- Do we have any intel on these people?
<i>- We are working on that, sir.</i>

1009
00:59:56,881 --> 00:59:58,761
You have to get the president
out of there.

1010
00:59:58,921 --> 01:00:01,201
- Can you get to the basement?
- Yeah, sure.

1011
01:00:01,361 --> 01:00:03,081
- Yeah.
<i>- There's a series of tunnels.</i>

1012
01:00:03,241 --> 01:00:05,121
JFK used them to sneak Marilyn in.

1013
01:00:05,281 --> 01:00:07,121
- I thought that was a myth.
- It's true.

1014
01:00:07,281 --> 01:00:08,481
Donnie's gonna be pissed.

1015
01:00:08,641 --> 01:00:10,961
<i>Get to the basement.
I'll lead you to the tunnels.</i>

1016
01:00:11,121 --> 01:00:14,521
Okay, Carol, I got separated from Emily.
Can you tell me if she made it out?

1017
01:00:14,681 --> 01:00:18,481
We're gonna find her, but you have got
to get the president to safety, okay?

1018
01:00:26,841 --> 01:00:29,441
Cale? Cale? Can you get him back?

1019
01:01:02,721 --> 01:01:03,761
Son of a bitch!

1020
01:01:17,641 --> 01:01:20,801
Get your hands off my Jordans!

1021
01:01:30,801 --> 01:01:32,881
Freeze! I said freeze!

1022
01:01:33,041 --> 01:01:34,281
Shoot him!

1023
01:01:34,841 --> 01:01:35,881
No, don't shoot him.

1024
01:01:40,801 --> 01:01:42,161
Shoot him!

1025
01:01:47,841 --> 01:01:49,321
Shit.

1026
01:01:56,241 --> 01:01:59,561
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1027
01:01:59,721 --> 01:02:01,281
Don't worry about him.

1028
01:02:01,441 --> 01:02:05,081
He would've killed me
if you wouldn't have killed him.

1029
01:02:07,681 --> 01:02:09,361
Thanks, asshole.

1030
01:02:09,521 --> 01:02:11,601
Look what I found. Merry Christmas.

1031
01:02:11,761 --> 01:02:14,001
- You got the satphone?
- Right here.

1032
01:02:14,161 --> 01:02:15,441
And it's on.

1033
01:02:17,321 --> 01:02:20,401
- Mr. President, are you okay?
- Define "okay."

1034
01:02:20,561 --> 01:02:21,921
<i>What happened, John?</i>

1035
01:02:22,081 --> 01:02:24,241
We got two dead bad guys,
that's what happened.

1036
01:02:24,401 --> 01:02:27,801
These guys had military training. You
gotta find out what they're doing here.

1037
01:02:27,961 --> 01:02:29,081
<i>Walker demanded a ransom.</i>

1038
01:02:29,241 --> 01:02:31,761
You think they're going through this
for money?

1039
01:02:31,921 --> 01:02:33,921
- You need to see this.
<i>- Hang on, John.</i>

1040
01:02:34,081 --> 01:02:35,921
<i>...people watching all of this together.</i>

1041
01:02:36,081 --> 01:02:39,001
<i>No doubt young Emily Cale
had to risk her own life to...</i>

1042
01:02:39,161 --> 01:02:43,201
Can you get me the president here?
Cale, can you turn on the news?

1043
01:02:43,361 --> 01:02:44,881
You got a TV?

1044
01:02:45,041 --> 01:02:47,521
We need to find out how Walker
found these guys.

1045
01:02:47,681 --> 01:02:50,161
<i>- John, you've gotta turn on the news.</i>
- What's going on?

1046
01:02:50,321 --> 01:02:51,401
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

1047
01:02:51,561 --> 01:02:54,601
<i>What you are seeing really is
just amazing footage...</i>

1048
01:02:54,761 --> 01:02:59,401
<i>...captured by an extremely brave
young girl by the name of Emily Cale.</i>

1049
01:02:59,561 --> 01:03:03,241
<i>Now, these are the first images coming
to us from inside the White House...</i>

1050
01:03:03,401 --> 01:03:05,761
<i>...from inside this hostage situation.</i>

1051
01:03:05,921 --> 01:03:10,481
<i>The images have gone viral. They've
had more than a hundred million...</i>

1052
01:03:10,641 --> 01:03:12,201
Wait. Cale, Cale, listen.

1053
01:03:12,721 --> 01:03:15,081
We're all walking out of here together,
okay?

1054
01:03:15,241 --> 01:03:16,641
I gotta go get her.

1055
01:03:16,801 --> 01:03:18,001
- Captain.
- Yes, sir?

1056
01:03:18,161 --> 01:03:21,201
Get me facial recognition
on everyone in that video now.

1057
01:03:21,361 --> 01:03:24,241
<i>...very brave young girl
named Emily Cale.</i>

1058
01:03:24,401 --> 01:03:26,321
<i>The hostages include the nine girls...</i>

1059
01:03:26,481 --> 01:03:29,161
<i>...from Watkins Charter School
in Louisville...</i>

1060
01:03:29,321 --> 01:03:31,121
<i>...five Cabinet members as well...</i>

1061
01:03:31,281 --> 01:03:35,001
<i>...and also, understandably,
a very emotional Roger Skinner.</i>

1062
01:03:35,161 --> 01:03:36,881
<i>And from what I understand now...</i>

1063
01:03:47,441 --> 01:03:50,321
I got the president a scrambled
satphone to call his family with.

1064
01:03:50,481 --> 01:03:53,841
<i>He keeps it in his bedside table
in the residence. See if it's still there.</i>

1065
01:03:56,201 --> 01:03:57,161
No. No.

1066
01:04:05,801 --> 01:04:09,321
Vadim, would you be kind enough
to confirm your last name for me, please?

1067
01:04:10,601 --> 01:04:12,761
- Let's go.
- They're in the residence.

1068
01:04:12,921 --> 01:04:14,401
Go! That's them in the residence.

1069
01:04:16,481 --> 01:04:17,841
Easy.

1070
01:04:24,001 --> 01:04:26,561
<i>...And the faces of the terrorists.</i>

1071
01:04:26,721 --> 01:04:28,361
You gotta be shitting me.

1072
01:04:28,521 --> 01:04:31,401
<i>So we are going to put those faces
up on-screen right now...</i>

1073
01:04:31,561 --> 01:04:32,881
In here!

1074
01:04:33,041 --> 01:04:35,841
<i>As we put these faces up on-screen,
we are sure that we will...</i>

1075
01:04:36,001 --> 01:04:38,561
<i>...no doubt learn the names
of the men who are...</i>

1076
01:04:38,721 --> 01:04:40,961
<i>...holding the White House hostage.</i>

1077
01:04:41,121 --> 01:04:44,241
<i>These men are clearly not al Qaeda.</i>

1078
01:04:44,401 --> 01:04:47,841
<i>We are positive
that the FBI will have...</i>

1079
01:04:48,001 --> 01:04:50,801
<i>...those images out.
So again, these are images...</i>

1080
01:04:50,961 --> 01:04:52,601
<i>...captured by a brave young girl...</i>

1081
01:04:52,961 --> 01:04:55,561
How many more ways can you guys
screw this thing up?

1082
01:04:58,401 --> 01:04:59,801
Hey.

1083
01:05:00,361 --> 01:05:03,761
How you like your chair?
You comfortable, Mr. Skinner?

1084
01:05:03,921 --> 01:05:05,801
Let me ask you a question.

1085
01:05:05,961 --> 01:05:08,401
Where do you come up with
all the ideas for your show?

1086
01:05:10,241 --> 01:05:12,081
- I...
- You got guys who do that for you?

1087
01:05:12,721 --> 01:05:15,881
Because, believe me,
I got some good ideas.

1088
01:05:30,001 --> 01:05:31,121
Hey!

1089
01:05:36,001 --> 01:05:37,321
Give it to me.

1090
01:05:48,561 --> 01:05:51,601
Congratulations, asshole,
you just made us all famous.

1091
01:05:54,241 --> 01:05:57,841
When they come for us,
you're gonna die first.

1092
01:05:59,321 --> 01:06:00,721
Get away from me.

1093
01:06:01,321 --> 01:06:04,081
- You understand?
- Get away from me.

1094
01:06:18,241 --> 01:06:21,321
<i>Sir, we have facial recognition
coming up right now.</i>

1095
01:06:21,961 --> 01:06:24,881
Carl Killick.
This guy's a right-wing sociopath.

1096
01:06:25,041 --> 01:06:28,241
First arrested at age 12.
Tried to blow up his local post office...

1097
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:30,721
...because they employed
too many African-Americans.

1098
01:06:30,881 --> 01:06:32,401
Last seen with Conrad Cern.

1099
01:06:32,561 --> 01:06:34,001
I saw that guy at the Capitol.

1100
01:06:34,161 --> 01:06:36,721
<i>He runs a white-power hate blog
against President Sawyer.</i>

1101
01:06:36,881 --> 01:06:39,761
- Lovely.
- Jesus. Skip Tyler.

1102
01:06:39,921 --> 01:06:41,921
King of the hackers.
Worked for the NSA.

1103
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:44,441
Was fired for rewriting
nuclear launch coordinates...

1104
01:06:44,601 --> 01:06:46,481
...to target Apple headquarters.

1105
01:06:46,641 --> 01:06:49,041
He was unhappy
with their music-sharing polices.

1106
01:06:49,201 --> 01:06:50,961
Walker's been after this guy forever.

1107
01:06:51,121 --> 01:06:54,001
<i>And Emil Stenz. Ex-Delta Force.</i>

1108
01:06:54,161 --> 01:06:55,441
<i>Highly decorated.</i>

1109
01:06:55,601 --> 01:06:57,041
I'm afraid we know this guy too.

1110
01:06:57,201 --> 01:06:59,281
- How?
- Unfortunately, that's classified.

1111
01:06:59,441 --> 01:07:02,561
Well, I hereby declassify it.
Now, you wanna share it with the group?

1112
01:07:02,721 --> 01:07:05,201
Stenz did off-the-books wetwork
for us in Pakistan...

1113
01:07:05,361 --> 01:07:07,121
<i>was part of a black-bag
CIA operation.</i>

1114
01:07:07,281 --> 01:07:10,121
<i>When the Sawyer administration
came in, the new secretary of defence...</i>

1115
01:07:10,281 --> 01:07:12,641
...shut down the operation
and disavowed its assets...

1116
01:07:12,801 --> 01:07:15,041
...including Stenz.
His identity was compromised.

1117
01:07:15,201 --> 01:07:18,001
He wound up spending two years
in a Taliban-controlled prison.

1118
01:07:18,161 --> 01:07:20,561
- No wonder he's pissed at us.
- It's the threat matrix.

1119
01:07:20,721 --> 01:07:22,761
Every day the Secret Service
does a rundown...

1120
01:07:22,921 --> 01:07:26,041
...of threats against the president.
Every one of these guys was on it.

1121
01:07:26,201 --> 01:07:28,401
It's like Walker used
it as a shopping list.

1122
01:07:28,561 --> 01:07:30,321
Sir, Delta Force is 15 minutes out.

1123
01:07:30,481 --> 01:07:34,161
<i>All right, general. I want them prepped
for an attack on the White House...</i>

1124
01:07:34,321 --> 01:07:36,681
<i>- ...as soon as I give the word.</i>
- Sir, please! Please.

1125
01:07:36,841 --> 01:07:38,601
Only the president can give that order.

1126
01:07:38,761 --> 01:07:41,041
<i>The president is behind enemy lines
and compromised.</i>

1127
01:07:41,201 --> 01:07:44,921
<i>I'm calling the Cabinet together
to invoke the 25th.</i>

1128
01:07:45,081 --> 01:07:46,641
<i>Gel' behind this, Eli.</i>

1129
01:07:47,401 --> 01:07:49,281
<i>What if this were even a coup d'état?</i>

1130
01:07:49,441 --> 01:07:50,841
<i>Come on, that's just nonsense.</i>

1131
01:07:51,001 --> 01:07:53,121
<i>Why isn't the military doing anything?</i>

1132
01:07:53,281 --> 01:07:55,921
<i>You gotta understand,
this is a very difficult situation...</i>

1133
01:07:56,081 --> 01:07:59,681
<i>...for the Pentagon, there are hostages.
You can't bring the big guns out...</i>

1134
01:07:59,841 --> 01:08:02,681
<i>...because there's a class
of little schoolgirls still inside.</i>

1135
01:08:18,081 --> 01:08:19,401
- Martin!
- Good morning, boys.

1136
01:08:19,561 --> 01:08:20,881
Move, move!

1137
01:08:23,121 --> 01:08:24,361
Come on, go, go, go!

1138
01:08:25,641 --> 01:08:28,241
- They're in the ground-floor kitchen.
- That's it.

1139
01:08:28,401 --> 01:08:30,241
Come on, go, go, go!
Where's the basement?

1140
01:08:30,401 --> 01:08:32,041
Through here. To the left.

1141
01:08:50,561 --> 01:08:51,881
- Shit!
- They're gone.

1142
01:08:52,041 --> 01:08:53,521
Goddamn it!

1143
01:08:54,761 --> 01:08:58,201
- I have the president and Cale calling.
- Cale, give me your location.

1144
01:08:58,361 --> 01:09:01,521
All right, we're in the basement.
There's a gate with a keypad.

1145
01:09:02,161 --> 01:09:04,961
Okay, the code is 64762.

1146
01:09:06,961 --> 01:09:08,041
All right, we're in.

1147
01:09:08,201 --> 01:09:11,441
Go down the hallway. That should be
the entrance to the catacombs.

1148
01:09:11,601 --> 01:09:13,281
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

1149
01:09:13,961 --> 01:09:18,041
You should then be in a big oval room.
There'll be five tunnels.

1150
01:09:18,201 --> 01:09:20,521
Take the second tunnel,
follow it all the way out...

1151
01:09:20,681 --> 01:09:23,241
- ...and we'll be waiting.
- We found it. Mr. President...

1152
01:09:23,401 --> 01:09:24,521
...take this.

1153
01:09:24,681 --> 01:09:26,481
- I can't go.
- What are you talking about?

1154
01:09:26,641 --> 01:09:28,881
- I'm not leaving my little girl.
- Then I'm staying.

1155
01:09:29,041 --> 01:09:31,041
You gotta go back
to being president, sir.

1156
01:09:31,201 --> 01:09:34,281
- Otherwise, all this is for nothing.
- You can't do this by yourself.

1157
01:09:34,441 --> 01:09:38,801
You're gonna go and send the Marines
in here to get us, okay? Promise me.

1158
01:09:38,961 --> 01:09:40,241
All right.

1159
01:09:41,521 --> 01:09:43,561
You got my word. Thanks, John.

1160
01:09:43,721 --> 01:09:44,721
All right.

1161
01:09:50,561 --> 01:09:51,721
See you outside.

1162
01:10:06,641 --> 01:10:07,921
They are in the basement.

1163
01:10:08,081 --> 01:10:11,081
All right, everyone in the basement!
The basement!

1164
01:10:13,041 --> 01:10:14,481
Cale, come check this out.

1165
01:10:15,921 --> 01:10:17,761
Okay, please don't touch my toys.

1166
01:10:18,401 --> 01:10:21,841
That's something
that we do not wanna touch.

1167
01:10:22,001 --> 01:10:23,121
Carol, we got a problem.

1168
01:10:23,281 --> 01:10:26,081
The exit tunnel's wired with explosives.
We need another exit.

1169
01:10:26,241 --> 01:10:27,681
There isn't another exit.

1170
01:10:28,761 --> 01:10:30,001
It's locked!

1171
01:10:30,161 --> 01:10:33,201
- Tyler, I need the gate code.
- I have that right here.

1172
01:10:33,361 --> 01:10:34,641
Here's your gate code.

1173
01:10:34,801 --> 01:10:36,521
This is not happening.
We gotta move.

1174
01:10:36,681 --> 01:10:38,601
- Carol, where are we going?
- Hold on.

1175
01:10:38,761 --> 01:10:40,121
I can't hold on.

1176
01:10:43,041 --> 01:10:44,561
We need a location right now!

1177
01:10:45,561 --> 01:10:48,041
Stagecoach. Follow me.
Let's get to the Stagecoach.

1178
01:10:48,361 --> 01:10:49,681
No, no, no, you'll be trapped.

1179
01:10:51,361 --> 01:10:54,161
This is a bad idea.
They grounded all aircraft.

1180
01:10:54,321 --> 01:10:57,481
This is Jack Freeman reporting live
from the skies over Washington, D.C.

1181
01:10:57,641 --> 01:11:01,601
We're bringing you exclusive images
of the terrorist-held White House.

1182
01:11:01,761 --> 01:11:03,121
Clear left.

1183
01:11:07,481 --> 01:11:10,401
Cabinet is assembling with
the vice president to invoke the 25th.

1184
01:11:10,561 --> 01:11:13,121
<i>Cale, if you don't get him out
in the next five minutes...</i>

1185
01:11:13,281 --> 01:11:16,881
<i>- ...he might not be president anymore.</i>
- You didn't give me the job, remember?

1186
01:11:17,841 --> 01:11:19,681
What's the code to D227?

1187
01:11:20,241 --> 01:11:22,001
What's the code for D227?

1188
01:11:22,161 --> 01:11:23,361
Hold on.

1189
01:11:23,521 --> 01:11:25,481
Fast! Go, go, go! Go, go!

1190
01:11:28,201 --> 01:11:29,361
13350.

1191
01:11:33,441 --> 01:11:34,761
We're in, let's go!

1192
01:11:34,921 --> 01:11:37,001
- Go, I'll cover you!
- All right, all right!

1193
01:11:39,361 --> 01:11:42,321
This way, Cale. The keys.

1194
01:11:48,881 --> 01:11:50,121
Got them!

1195
01:11:51,601 --> 01:11:54,161
What the hell
are you getting in the back for?

1196
01:11:54,321 --> 01:11:55,601
Sorry, force of habit.

1197
01:12:07,321 --> 01:12:09,721
Damn it! Keys! Let's go! Let's go!

1198
01:12:14,001 --> 01:12:15,561
- I'm crashing the gate.
- No, no, no!

1199
01:12:15,721 --> 01:12:19,121
It's 8 feet tall and dual-hardened steel.
We're not gonna make it. Left!

1200
01:12:21,521 --> 01:12:24,521
- Where's the garage clicker?
- You kidding? I don't have a clicker.

1201
01:12:24,681 --> 01:12:26,161
Suburban!

1202
01:12:27,041 --> 01:12:30,441
I think I'm seeing the presidential limo
driving across the grounds.

1203
01:12:33,401 --> 01:12:35,241
We're gonna out them off!
Hang on, Motts!

1204
01:12:35,401 --> 01:12:37,321
Watch out, watch out, watch out!

1205
01:12:37,961 --> 01:12:39,761
Cale, they're in heavy weapons
follow-up.

1206
01:12:40,081 --> 01:12:41,641
What do you mean, "heavy weapon"?

1207
01:12:43,241 --> 01:12:44,801
You gotta be kidding me right now!

1208
01:12:47,161 --> 01:12:48,401
Move!

1209
01:12:51,721 --> 01:12:53,881
Oh, my goodness!
The presidential limo...

1210
01:12:54,041 --> 01:12:56,841
...has just burst onto the South Lawn!

1211
01:12:58,601 --> 01:13:00,881
- So sorry.
- Ladies and gentlemen of the Cabinet...

1212
01:13:01,041 --> 01:13:03,681
- ...it's with a heavy heart...
- Sir, you have to see this!

1213
01:13:04,321 --> 01:13:06,961
<i>It's trying to make its way
around the South Lawn fountain.</i>

1214
01:13:07,121 --> 01:13:09,321
<i>That iconic fountain
that everybody knows...</i>

1215
01:13:09,481 --> 01:13:11,721
<i>...anyone who's ever been
to the White House knows.</i>

1216
01:13:12,081 --> 01:13:14,121
Box them in! Go for the window, Motts!

1217
01:13:18,281 --> 01:13:20,241
Tanks. We got tanks.
Let's put them to use.

1218
01:13:21,721 --> 01:13:23,121
I think that's my dad.

1219
01:13:23,281 --> 01:13:25,441
I'm not sure using heavy artillery
is a wise...

1220
01:13:25,601 --> 01:13:27,681
I don't give a damn. You get that tank...

1221
01:13:27,841 --> 01:13:30,321
- ...you put a hole in the goddamn fence!
- Yeah! Come on!

1222
01:13:31,081 --> 01:13:33,241
Look, look, look!
Watch him, watch him, watch him.

1223
01:13:33,401 --> 01:13:35,361
Go for the windshield! Go!

1224
01:13:39,761 --> 01:13:42,161
- Watch out, watch out, watch out.
- Get your head down.

1225
01:13:56,321 --> 01:13:58,161
- Yeah, that's one down.
- Shit!

1226
01:13:58,321 --> 01:14:00,081
- Commander, are you in position?
- Roger.

1227
01:14:00,241 --> 01:14:02,921
- Then go to work.
- Fall back! Fall back!

1228
01:14:04,241 --> 01:14:05,361
Driver, advance!

1229
01:14:05,521 --> 01:14:09,001
We don't know what is happening exactly,
but the National Guard is in fact...

1230
01:14:09,161 --> 01:14:11,281
...enacting some sort of manoeuvre.
It depends...

1231
01:14:13,401 --> 01:14:15,201
RPG'S! Now!

1232
01:14:17,601 --> 01:14:19,601
Blow these bastards off the roof.

1233
01:14:22,961 --> 01:14:24,681
- Take cover!
- Fire!

1234
01:14:34,441 --> 01:14:35,721
Incoming!

1235
01:14:41,201 --> 01:14:42,321
Commander, come in!

1236
01:14:46,921 --> 01:14:48,561
- Goddamn it!
- Shit.

1237
01:14:50,041 --> 01:14:51,881
Good job, boys! Great job, Mulcahy!

1238
01:14:52,041 --> 01:14:55,761
<i>This is an unprecedented situation.
We have a full-scale war going on...</i>

1239
01:14:55,921 --> 01:14:57,401
<i>...on the White House grounds.</i>

1240
01:14:57,561 --> 01:15:00,001
Mulcahy! Take out the limo!
Let's go! Take the limo!

1241
01:15:01,641 --> 01:15:03,641
<i>What are you waiting on? Take it out!</i>

1242
01:15:04,201 --> 01:15:05,641
<i>They're firing.</i>

1243
01:15:07,281 --> 01:15:10,001
- I can't see. What am I supposed to do?
- I need him alive!

1244
01:15:10,161 --> 01:15:11,881
<i>- That's an order!</i>
- Why don't you shut up?

1245
01:15:12,041 --> 01:15:14,201
There's a camera system
here in the car. There.

1246
01:15:14,361 --> 01:15:17,361
- What am I doing with zombies?
- It's my daughter's favourite movie.

1247
01:15:17,521 --> 01:15:19,281
Watch out, watch out! Left!

1248
01:15:21,401 --> 01:15:24,401
We gotta punch a hole in this fence soon
or we're dead in the water.

1249
01:15:24,561 --> 01:15:27,401
There's a weapons locker in the back.

1250
01:15:27,641 --> 01:15:30,081
- Jackpot!
- What you got?

1251
01:15:30,241 --> 01:15:31,441
That's what I'm talking about!

1252
01:15:31,601 --> 01:15:34,321
That thing in your right hand is
a blast shield. Perfect.

1253
01:15:35,601 --> 01:15:38,801
Can you not hit me in the head
with a rocket while I'm trying to drive?!

1254
01:15:38,961 --> 01:15:40,401
Get me to the fence, Cale!

1255
01:15:41,441 --> 01:15:45,081
- Stick that thing out there, go to work.
- Damn right.

1256
01:15:45,241 --> 01:15:47,601
Hold it with two hands, Mr. President.

1257
01:15:47,761 --> 01:15:49,441
Oh, my God, that's President Sawyer.

1258
01:15:49,601 --> 01:15:51,721
<i>- He has a rocket launcher.</i>
- There's something...

1259
01:15:51,881 --> 01:15:53,521
...you don't see every day.

1260
01:15:53,721 --> 01:15:54,961
Here it comes!

1261
01:16:01,161 --> 01:16:04,041
- I lost the rocket launcher.
- How do you lose a rocket launcher?

1262
01:16:05,041 --> 01:16:08,841
<i>Killick, take one of the hostages outside.
Show them we mean business.</i>

1263
01:16:09,001 --> 01:16:10,441
<i>This just in from China.</i>

1264
01:16:10,601 --> 01:16:12,681
<i>- -Destroyed the West Gate
of the White House.</i>

1265
01:16:14,161 --> 01:16:16,561
- We got our exit.
- One more time around the fountain.

1266
01:16:17,041 --> 01:16:18,321
- No!
- Get over here.

1267
01:16:18,481 --> 01:16:21,081
<i>One of the terrorists
is holding a little girl at gunpoint.</i>

1268
01:16:21,241 --> 01:16:23,681
- What'd he say?
<i>- Emily Cale is being held...</i>

1269
01:16:23,841 --> 01:16:26,881
<i>...at the White House balcony right now
by the terrorists.</i>

1270
01:16:27,041 --> 01:16:31,121
<i>She was the one who managed to send
this video out so the world could see...</i>

1271
01:16:31,681 --> 01:16:33,481
<i>- Another rocket.</i>
- Cale!

1272
01:16:35,481 --> 01:16:36,561
Dad!

1273
01:16:42,281 --> 01:16:43,841
<i>I can't see what is going on...</i>

1274
01:16:44,001 --> 01:16:45,801
Get me a location on them now!

1275
01:16:46,121 --> 01:16:47,961
...The West Wing. The president has...

1276
01:16:48,121 --> 01:16:50,201
We're not sure if he's alive
or dead right now.

1277
01:16:50,361 --> 01:16:52,401
- The limousine has disappeared...
- Emily?

1278
01:16:52,561 --> 01:16:54,201
<i>...The West Wing. I can't see him...</i>

1279
01:16:54,361 --> 01:16:55,921
Killick, take her back inside.

1280
01:16:56,081 --> 01:16:58,801
- Dad!
- Get over here!

1281
01:17:02,521 --> 01:17:04,481
Shit. What the...?

1282
01:17:11,841 --> 01:17:14,161
- Something wrong with your radio?
- Malfunctioned.

1283
01:17:14,321 --> 01:17:17,041
Stay behind me. They won't shoot us.
They need me alive.

1284
01:17:17,201 --> 01:17:18,761
- Put a gun to my head.
- What?

1285
01:17:18,921 --> 01:17:21,041
That concludes
the running-and-shooting portion.

1286
01:17:21,201 --> 01:17:22,841
Stay back or I'll shoot him!

1287
01:17:23,001 --> 01:17:26,561
Appreciate what you're trying to do, son.
Did the same job myself, and proudly.

1288
01:17:26,721 --> 01:17:29,761
I have no quarrel with you,
but I do have a deadline.

1289
01:17:29,921 --> 01:17:31,081
So put the gun down...

1290
01:17:31,241 --> 01:17:32,241
Pull the pin.

1291
01:17:32,401 --> 01:17:34,601
...because you're not
gonna shoot the president.

1292
01:17:34,761 --> 01:17:36,881
- You're right.
- Where does that leave us, boys?

1293
01:17:37,201 --> 01:17:39,281
That leaves us with this.

1294
01:17:40,601 --> 01:17:42,281
Come on!

1295
01:17:42,441 --> 01:17:43,601
Go, go, go!

1296
01:17:50,561 --> 01:17:52,241
What are you doing?!

1297
01:17:56,441 --> 01:17:57,441
Oh, no. Come on, go!

1298
01:17:57,601 --> 01:17:59,761
This way! Follow me! Follow me!

1299
01:18:05,161 --> 01:18:08,081
Enormous explosion
over toward the West Wing.

1300
01:18:08,241 --> 01:18:11,441
<i>I don't know if this means the president
has been killed. We know...</i>

1301
01:18:11,601 --> 01:18:14,401
I got 100 people in here!
Somebody tell me something!

1302
01:18:17,361 --> 01:18:19,201
- You idiot.
- What'd you say?

1303
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:21,681
You are an idiot.

1304
01:18:21,841 --> 01:18:23,441
You just blew our whole mission.

1305
01:18:23,601 --> 01:18:25,041
- Your mission.
- Shut up.

1306
01:18:40,961 --> 01:18:44,521
Mr. Stenz, this may be your lucky day.
Get your men back to the basement.

1307
01:18:46,761 --> 01:18:50,161
I, Alvin Hammond, do solemnly swear
that I will faithfully execute...

1308
01:18:50,321 --> 01:18:52,521
...the office of president
of the United States...

1309
01:18:52,681 --> 01:18:56,521
...and will to the best of my ability
preserve, protect and defend...

1310
01:18:56,681 --> 01:19:00,361
...the Constitution of the United States,
so help me God.

1311
01:19:00,521 --> 01:19:03,241
Sir, follow me, please.

1312
01:19:12,721 --> 01:19:14,841
Place your hand there
for scanning, please.

1313
01:19:17,401 --> 01:19:19,801
Sir, these are your presidential
launch codes.

1314
01:19:19,961 --> 01:19:21,721
Keep them on your person
at all times.

1315
01:19:21,881 --> 01:19:24,801
<i>Vice President Alvin Hammond
has just been sworn in...</i>

1316
01:19:24,961 --> 01:19:27,681
<i>...as the 47th president
of the United States...</i>

1317
01:19:27,841 --> 01:19:31,041
<i>...confirming, of course,
the worst possible scenario...</i>

1318
01:19:31,201 --> 01:19:33,841
<i>...the death of President James Sawyer.</i>

1319
01:19:34,001 --> 01:19:36,561
<i>People all over the globe
have been holding their breath.</i>

1320
01:19:36,721 --> 01:19:40,081
<i>They're wondering what is happening
right here in America.</i>

1321
01:19:40,241 --> 01:19:43,561
<i>After all, the United States has the
biggest weapons arsenal in the world.</i>

1322
01:19:43,721 --> 01:19:47,321
We need to start moving the money.
Maybe buy some time.

1323
01:19:47,481 --> 01:19:51,961
<i>- -Will he be able to get this extremely
volatile situation under control.</i>

1324
01:19:52,121 --> 01:19:53,601
Muriel Walker's here.

1325
01:19:53,761 --> 01:19:56,601
<i>Thousands are gathering,
leaving candles and flowers...</i>

1326
01:19:56,761 --> 01:19:58,801
<i>...at the doors of the U.S...</i>

1327
01:19:58,961 --> 01:20:00,201
We've got movement.

1328
01:20:01,841 --> 01:20:04,121
We've got movement
at the Federal Reserve.

1329
01:20:04,281 --> 01:20:06,961
<i>Stenz, do you hear me?
Confirming they're loading the money.</i>

1330
01:20:07,121 --> 01:20:08,881
<i>Let's wrap this up.</i>

1331
01:20:09,641 --> 01:20:11,761
Stenz, we're wasting our time here.

1332
01:20:11,921 --> 01:20:14,321
Walker, are you sure
they're down here?

1333
01:20:14,481 --> 01:20:18,201
<i>Did I spend 15 goddamn years
running this place or did you?!</i>

1334
01:20:18,361 --> 01:20:19,841
This guy is losing it.

1335
01:20:20,641 --> 01:20:22,521
What do we care if he gets the president?

1336
01:20:22,681 --> 01:20:23,881
We made a deal.

1337
01:20:26,561 --> 01:20:28,401
Cale was right.
This is not about ransom.

1338
01:20:28,561 --> 01:20:30,081
Walker has cancer.

1339
01:20:30,241 --> 01:20:32,201
His doctors gave him
less than three months.

1340
01:20:32,361 --> 01:20:34,961
He has a golf-ball-sized tumour
on his frontal lobe.

1341
01:20:35,121 --> 01:20:36,321
Jesus Christ.

1342
01:20:36,481 --> 01:20:38,801
I think he's on a suicide mission.

1343
01:20:40,201 --> 01:20:41,401
- You ready?
- Yes.

1344
01:20:41,561 --> 01:20:44,441
- What do you think you're doing?
- If anybody can talk him down...

1345
01:20:44,601 --> 01:20:45,841
...it's her, trust me.

1346
01:20:48,401 --> 01:20:51,441
A little birdie told me
you're finally moving the money.

1347
01:20:51,601 --> 01:20:53,041
<i>Martin?</i>

1348
01:20:58,841 --> 01:21:01,681
<i>I had to tell them
about the tumour, Martin.</i>

1349
01:21:04,921 --> 01:21:06,161
That's all right.

1350
01:21:07,641 --> 01:21:09,361
<i>Please stop this.</i>

1351
01:21:10,321 --> 01:21:12,641
Please just come home.

1352
01:21:15,721 --> 01:21:17,681
I have to do this, honey.

1353
01:21:18,321 --> 01:21:19,361
No, you don't.

1354
01:21:20,041 --> 01:21:22,601
They have to pay
for what they did to Kevin.

1355
01:21:23,281 --> 01:21:24,641
<i>And when it's over...</i>

1356
01:21:26,321 --> 01:21:27,721
...I promise...

1357
01:21:29,441 --> 01:21:30,721
I promise you'll understand.

1358
01:21:39,721 --> 01:21:41,281
You're doing this for Kevin?

1359
01:21:42,121 --> 01:21:43,761
I swear to God.

1360
01:21:49,681 --> 01:21:51,961
Then you do whatever it takes.

1361
01:21:52,881 --> 01:21:55,441
You make them pay
for what they did to our boy.

1362
01:21:55,601 --> 01:21:57,321
What the hell are you doing?

1363
01:21:58,401 --> 01:21:59,921
<i>Walker, you stop this...</i>

1364
01:22:00,081 --> 01:22:03,401
...or I'll make sure she spends
the rest of her life in a federal prison.

1365
01:22:03,721 --> 01:22:05,161
You have 19 minutes.

1366
01:22:09,721 --> 01:22:10,761
You're done.

1367
01:22:10,921 --> 01:22:12,841
- General.
- Your boss took the White House...

1368
01:22:13,001 --> 01:22:15,121
...and your man inside
got the president killed.

1369
01:22:15,321 --> 01:22:18,001
- Carol, calm down.
- You're free to go.

1370
01:22:21,201 --> 01:22:23,401
Thank God for Gerald Ford.

1371
01:22:23,561 --> 01:22:24,601
Why?

1372
01:22:24,761 --> 01:22:28,241
He built this because he didn't want
the press to see him in his swim trunks.

1373
01:22:28,401 --> 01:22:31,881
- Any chance this leads out of here?
- No. Listen, I gotta stop for a second.

1374
01:22:32,041 --> 01:22:34,161
What? You all right?

1375
01:22:34,721 --> 01:22:36,321
That's not good, is it?

1376
01:22:36,481 --> 01:22:38,321
- Stenz worked for the CIA, right?
- Right.

1377
01:22:39,121 --> 01:22:41,401
If we can track the way
that Walker contacted...

1378
01:22:41,561 --> 01:22:43,761
...these guys,
we can figure out how to stop them.

1379
01:22:43,921 --> 01:22:46,561
- How do you propose we do that?
- Keep an eye on Caulfield.

1380
01:22:47,761 --> 01:22:48,881
Wait, what?

1381
01:22:50,921 --> 01:22:52,641
Hi. I'm Carol.

1382
01:22:54,241 --> 01:22:56,081
I'm not supposed to talk to you
right now.

1383
01:22:56,241 --> 01:22:58,921
Run a database search
on the guys in that building.

1384
01:22:59,081 --> 01:23:01,361
CIA, NSA, everything you've got.

1385
01:23:04,401 --> 01:23:07,481
Okay, listen, Walker's not doing
this for the money, trust me.

1386
01:23:07,641 --> 01:23:10,441
- There is something else going on.
- I can't do that, ma'am.

1387
01:23:10,601 --> 01:23:13,521
On the worst day that our country
has ever had...

1388
01:23:13,681 --> 01:23:16,161
...you could be the key
to figuring all of this out.

1389
01:23:18,921 --> 01:23:22,121
<i>...could otherwise not accomplish that
is take back the White House.</i>

1390
01:23:25,761 --> 01:23:27,161
I'm gonna have to get that out.

1391
01:23:27,321 --> 01:23:29,321
When did you become a doctor
all of a sudden?

1392
01:23:29,481 --> 01:23:32,761
Look, just talk to me, get my mind off it.
Talk to me about your daughter.

1393
01:23:32,921 --> 01:23:35,081
Emily?
She's completely in love with you.

1394
01:23:35,241 --> 01:23:38,881
- She even tried to get me to vote for you.
- You didn't vote for me?

1395
01:23:41,001 --> 01:23:43,121
Your daughter's smart.
You should listen to her.

1396
01:23:43,441 --> 01:23:46,121
She was like 3 when I enlisted.

1397
01:23:46,281 --> 01:23:48,081
And to be honest with you...

1398
01:23:48,241 --> 01:23:50,801
...I was probably just running
from my marriage.

1399
01:23:50,961 --> 01:23:53,161
Right after I deployed,
Emily was watching TV...

1400
01:23:53,321 --> 01:23:56,081
...and there was coverage on
the troops in Afghanistan.

1401
01:23:56,241 --> 01:23:59,281
She swears to me that she saw me.

1402
01:23:59,441 --> 01:24:02,401
After that point,
she became obsessed with politics.

1403
01:24:02,561 --> 01:24:04,721
And that's when she first saw you.

1404
01:24:05,161 --> 01:24:07,441
The man that was gonna
bring Daddy home.

1405
01:24:07,601 --> 01:24:11,361
And when I finally did come home,
I realised that...

1406
01:24:13,801 --> 01:24:15,841
...I'm not her hero anymore.

1407
01:24:16,001 --> 01:24:20,401
So I guess I just figured that I'd try
to help protect the man that is.

1408
01:24:21,361 --> 01:24:23,881
Well, if she saw you today, Cale,
she'd be proud of you.

1409
01:24:24,041 --> 01:24:26,961
You know how when they're young
and they come running up to you...

1410
01:24:27,121 --> 01:24:29,361
...and they hug you
and they're shouting "Daddy"...

1411
01:24:29,521 --> 01:24:33,361
...and all of a sudden, one day,
that just stops?

1412
01:24:33,521 --> 01:24:34,601
Yeah.

1413
01:24:34,761 --> 01:24:37,001
I'd give anything for that hug
just one more time.

1414
01:24:37,681 --> 01:24:40,481
You know, my daughter,
she's 15 years old, her name is Amber.

1415
01:24:40,641 --> 01:24:43,401
You know what she wants
for her birthday?

1416
01:24:43,561 --> 01:24:46,321
- A belly button ring.
- Belly button ring.

1417
01:24:46,481 --> 01:24:49,361
- What parent is equipped for that?
- Daughters.

1418
01:24:52,721 --> 01:24:55,721
- What's happening?
<i>- Attention, attention.</i>

1419
01:24:55,881 --> 01:25:00,401
<i>Everyone below Calico T-11,
please clear the floor immediately.</i>

1420
01:25:00,561 --> 01:25:02,321
Put the president on-screen.

1421
01:25:03,601 --> 01:25:06,041
Mr. President, Delta Force entered
Washington airspace.

1422
01:25:06,201 --> 01:25:08,241
I have Lieutenant Colonel Cameron
on the line.

1423
01:25:10,361 --> 01:25:12,601
You're online, sir!

1424
01:25:13,161 --> 01:25:14,641
<i>What do you have for us, colonel?</i>

1425
01:25:14,801 --> 01:25:17,481
We developed this plan
independent of the Secret Service.

1426
01:25:17,641 --> 01:25:20,241
<i>We'll use the superstructure
of the city to mask our approach.</i>

1427
01:25:20,401 --> 01:25:22,281
What if they start killing hostages?

1428
01:25:22,441 --> 01:25:24,001
<i>They're dead anyway if this fails.</i>

1429
01:25:24,161 --> 01:25:26,081
Alvin, please think about
what you're doing.

1430
01:25:26,241 --> 01:25:29,681
<i>May I remind you that you are addressing
the president of the United States?</i>

1431
01:25:29,841 --> 01:25:32,681
<i>Mr. President, I don't wanna write off
any Americans yet.</i>

1432
01:25:32,841 --> 01:25:35,121
<i>Trust me, sir,
we'll get your house back for you.</i>

1433
01:25:35,281 --> 01:25:37,201
<i>- Mission's a go, colonel.
- Thank you, sir.</i>

1434
01:25:38,721 --> 01:25:43,561
You heard the president.
Flight time to target: six minutes.

1435
01:25:44,081 --> 01:25:46,841
- So, what's it like being president?
- It's not like anything.

1436
01:25:47,001 --> 01:25:49,841
Once you get into office,
it's all about re-election...

1437
01:25:50,001 --> 01:25:52,041
...and what the other side
can use against you.

1438
01:25:52,201 --> 01:25:55,361
- Politics.
- You don't start out a politician...

1439
01:25:55,521 --> 01:25:56,561
...but you become one.

1440
01:25:56,721 --> 01:25:59,441
Just once, though,
I wanna do something that's presidential.

1441
01:25:59,601 --> 01:26:02,521
Something along the lines of Lincoln,
Washington and Jefferson.

1442
01:26:02,681 --> 01:26:05,681
- You wanna make history.
- No. Not history.

1443
01:26:05,841 --> 01:26:07,321
I wanna make a difference.

1444
01:26:07,481 --> 01:26:10,121
If your little daughter
says that I'm her hero...

1445
01:26:10,281 --> 01:26:11,961
...then I gotta earn that.

1446
01:26:18,001 --> 01:26:22,001
All right, we go in low and quiet.
Time to target is two minutes.

1447
01:26:28,961 --> 01:26:33,521
- Falcon 2, maintain 3-0 feet.
- Falcon 1, copy, 3-0 feet.

1448
01:26:52,521 --> 01:26:55,921
- Drop to 1-0 feet!
- Falcon 2 dropping to 10 feet.

1449
01:26:58,441 --> 01:27:02,161
Complete chaos on the streets of D.C.
There's total gridlock through...

1450
01:27:02,321 --> 01:27:05,481
Oh, my God! U.S. Special Forces
are flying over us!

1451
01:27:16,081 --> 01:27:19,201
Shit. Sir, we have
Black Hawks coming in.

1452
01:27:19,361 --> 01:27:21,521
- Which direction?
- From I Street, and fast.

1453
01:27:24,241 --> 01:27:27,601
- How do you feel, Mr. President?
- Surprisingly good, Dr. Cale.

1454
01:27:29,201 --> 01:27:32,961
Let me call in, make sure
they don't think we're dead.

1455
01:27:33,121 --> 01:27:35,041
<i>The former vice president,
Alvin Hammond...</i>

1456
01:27:35,201 --> 01:27:37,961
<i>...is clearly calling the shots
as the new commander in chief.</i>

1457
01:27:38,121 --> 01:27:39,881
- I have John Cale on the line.
- Cale?

1458
01:27:40,041 --> 01:27:42,521
- Where's Carol?
- Finnerty's been relieved of command.

1459
01:27:42,681 --> 01:27:46,241
The cavalry's coming. Should be hitting
the residence in a few minutes.

1460
01:27:46,401 --> 01:27:48,721
No, no, no, not by air.
They have to come by ground.

1461
01:27:48,881 --> 01:27:51,441
- I think we can handle this.
- They have Javelin missiles.

1462
01:27:51,601 --> 01:27:52,921
Not according to our intel.

1463
01:27:53,081 --> 01:27:56,041
Even if we wanted to call them back,
they've gone dark.

1464
01:27:56,201 --> 01:27:59,401
If they fail, they're going to kill
every single one of those hostages...

1465
01:27:59,561 --> 01:28:01,521
- ...including my daughter.
- Just go.

1466
01:28:01,681 --> 01:28:03,801
Take this and stay out of sight.

1467
01:28:10,641 --> 01:28:12,841
- Thirty seconds!
- Let's go!

1468
01:28:13,001 --> 01:28:15,121
Incoming, three of them!
Spread out!

1469
01:28:16,681 --> 01:28:20,841
<i>Castle in sight.
I say again, Castle in sight.</i>

1470
01:28:21,001 --> 01:28:24,841
- Are you ready?
- Colonel, we got movement on the roof.

1471
01:28:25,001 --> 01:28:27,041
They've got missile lock!
Evasive manoeuvres!

1472
01:28:27,921 --> 01:28:29,361
<i>Break right! Javelins! Javelins!</i>

1473
01:28:29,521 --> 01:28:31,121
<i>Shit!</i>

1474
01:28:31,281 --> 01:28:33,801
- Break right!
- I can't hold out! We're going down!

1475
01:28:34,001 --> 01:28:36,561
- Mayday! Mayday!
- Shit.

1476
01:28:38,081 --> 01:28:40,561
Get down! Incoming!

1477
01:28:40,721 --> 01:28:41,841
<i>We're going down!</i>

1478
01:28:47,681 --> 01:28:49,481
<i>One is closing in on the White House.</i>

1479
01:28:49,721 --> 01:28:53,201
<i>Looks like it's checking on
the conditions of the hostages.</i>

1480
01:28:56,321 --> 01:28:59,121
What are you gonna do?
You gonna shoot the hostages?

1481
01:28:59,281 --> 01:29:02,641
Get on the 50-cal! Mulcahy, let's go!

1482
01:29:03,281 --> 01:29:04,561
<i>Hammer down! Hammer down!</i>

1483
01:29:06,961 --> 01:29:08,361
Fire!

1484
01:29:11,801 --> 01:29:14,001
Pull up! Pull up!

1485
01:29:17,641 --> 01:29:18,841
Yeah!

1486
01:29:27,161 --> 01:29:28,441
Last mag.

1487
01:29:29,321 --> 01:29:31,121
They've got missile lock!

1488
01:29:38,281 --> 01:29:39,281
<i>Movement on the roof.</i>

1489
01:29:51,681 --> 01:29:54,601
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!
I think that man is a friendly!

1490
01:30:02,561 --> 01:30:04,321
Get ready to deploy!

1491
01:30:05,001 --> 01:30:07,441
- Fast-rope down!
- Go, go!

1492
01:30:10,201 --> 01:30:12,361
<i>- Get us out! Missile!
- Javelin up! Javelin up!</i>

1493
01:30:12,521 --> 01:30:13,561
Countermeasures!

1494
01:30:13,721 --> 01:30:14,801
<i>Brace for impact!</i>

1495
01:30:30,281 --> 01:30:31,281
No.

1496
01:30:40,681 --> 01:30:42,601
<i>This mission is going terribly wrong.</i>

1497
01:30:42,761 --> 01:30:45,361
<i>I can see now that there
are two men on top of the roof...</i>

1498
01:30:45,521 --> 01:30:47,601
<i>...and they're engaged
in hand-to-hand combat.</i>

1499
01:31:59,561 --> 01:32:01,001
Shit!

1500
01:32:24,361 --> 01:32:26,881
Yes! Skip Tyler is in!

1501
01:32:27,921 --> 01:32:30,561
Walker, that last firewall
just came down.

1502
01:32:30,721 --> 01:32:32,041
Mr. Tyler...

1503
01:32:33,361 --> 01:32:35,121
...we are a go, sir.

1504
01:32:36,441 --> 01:32:38,201
God bless us all.

1505
01:33:03,721 --> 01:33:06,441
Sir. My weapons system
is coming online.

1506
01:33:07,081 --> 01:33:09,281
It's being accessed remotely. I can't...

1507
01:33:09,441 --> 01:33:11,241
- Jesus Christ, it's targeting.
- What?

1508
01:33:13,801 --> 01:33:15,641
It's firing.

1509
01:33:20,921 --> 01:33:23,481
Target is an aircraft
somewhere over Ohio.

1510
01:33:23,641 --> 01:33:26,361
Appears to be a modified 747.

1511
01:33:27,121 --> 01:33:28,081
Oh, my God.

1512
01:33:30,521 --> 01:33:33,201
<i>This is an emergency.
I repeat, this is an emergency.</i>

1513
01:33:33,921 --> 01:33:35,441
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

1514
01:33:35,601 --> 01:33:37,921
...And <i>fasten your seat belts.
I repeat, this is...</i>

1515
01:33:38,081 --> 01:33:39,401
Sir, we're under attack!

1516
01:34:03,361 --> 01:34:05,921
<i>It's clear that someone
on the inside has orchestrated...</i>

1517
01:34:06,081 --> 01:34:08,881
<i>...this takeover of the White House.
That's the only way...</i>

1518
01:34:09,041 --> 01:34:13,361
Mr. Speaker, we have confirmation
of ground impact.

1519
01:34:13,521 --> 01:34:16,521
- We're going to need to swear you in, sir.
- What?

1520
01:34:18,161 --> 01:34:21,441
Executive power passed to the
vice president when he was sworn in...

1521
01:34:21,601 --> 01:34:23,681
...which means the office
now passes to you.

1522
01:34:23,841 --> 01:34:26,161
- Sir.
- Please follow these men.

1523
01:34:37,041 --> 01:34:39,641
Sir, these are your
new presidential launch codes.

1524
01:34:39,801 --> 01:34:42,121
Please keep them on your person
at all times.

1525
01:34:42,281 --> 01:34:45,361
I need a moment here.
I need... I need to call my wife.

1526
01:34:45,521 --> 01:34:47,041
Of course, sir.

1527
01:34:47,201 --> 01:34:48,561
Thank you.

1528
01:34:51,321 --> 01:34:52,961
Emily Cale.

1529
01:34:57,041 --> 01:34:59,681
How are you enjoying your tour?

1530
01:34:59,841 --> 01:35:00,881
Remember these?

1531
01:35:01,041 --> 01:35:03,601
You and I have a date, sweetheart.

1532
01:35:08,561 --> 01:35:10,801
You'll have to go through me.

1533
01:35:10,961 --> 01:35:13,161
Really?

1534
01:35:16,881 --> 01:35:19,921
- You're gonna go to jail for that!
- And who's gonna make me?

1535
01:35:20,081 --> 01:35:21,921
The tourist is still on the loose.

1536
01:35:22,081 --> 01:35:25,681
But I have a hunch Daddy's
gonna come back for his little girl.

1537
01:35:25,841 --> 01:35:28,801
- So he's still alive.
- Not for very long, he isn't.

1538
01:35:29,961 --> 01:35:32,321
Don't screw up this time! Motts!

1539
01:35:32,481 --> 01:35:33,881
You stay here with him.

1540
01:35:34,041 --> 01:35:37,721
Hey! Do I look like I need a babysitter?

1541
01:35:38,521 --> 01:35:40,241
Sit down and shut up!

1542
01:35:51,961 --> 01:35:53,361
Oh, shit.

1543
01:35:57,801 --> 01:35:59,761
- Mr. President.
- I...

1544
01:36:02,801 --> 01:36:05,841
NORAD is fully compromised.
Martin Walker now has the ability...

1545
01:36:06,001 --> 01:36:08,561
...to launch missiles at any target
in the United States.

1546
01:36:08,721 --> 01:36:10,761
Our satellites show
massive troop movements...

1547
01:36:10,921 --> 01:36:13,121
...in Russia, Pakistan
and the Arabian Peninsula.

1548
01:36:13,281 --> 01:36:14,921
What are your orders, sir?

1549
01:36:20,121 --> 01:36:23,961
I swear to you all, I swear...

1550
01:36:24,121 --> 01:36:26,961
...that we are not beaten yet.
We are not!

1551
01:36:29,361 --> 01:36:30,681
No.

1552
01:36:33,041 --> 01:36:34,321
General...

1553
01:36:35,721 --> 01:36:38,401
...how soon can you execute an air strike
on the White House?

1554
01:36:38,561 --> 01:36:39,561
Sir.

1555
01:36:39,721 --> 01:36:41,961
We can have Raptors on target
in 10 minutes.

1556
01:36:42,121 --> 01:36:44,561
- Then do it.
- Let's go to work!

1557
01:36:44,721 --> 01:36:47,281
- Sir...
- Carol, we have to end this. We have to.

1558
01:36:47,441 --> 01:36:50,761
What if the next missile that he launches
is aimed at Chicago or New York?

1559
01:36:50,921 --> 01:36:54,281
- We're talking about millions of lives.
- Your first act as president...

1560
01:36:54,441 --> 01:36:56,281
...is going to be bombing
the White House?

1561
01:36:56,441 --> 01:36:58,161
Believe me, I know, I know.

1562
01:36:58,321 --> 01:37:00,401
But our country is stronger
than one house.

1563
01:37:00,561 --> 01:37:04,961
<i>This is Mission Control. Raptor Alpha 1,
clear to initiate Operation Free Castle.</i>

1564
01:37:05,121 --> 01:37:07,281
Copy that, Raptor Alpha 1
beginning approach.

1565
01:37:09,921 --> 01:37:12,721
<i>We've lost two
commanders in chief in one day.</i>

1566
01:37:12,881 --> 01:37:16,401
<i>Look, Mark, if I'm a foreign head of state,
and the United States of America...</i>

1567
01:37:16,561 --> 01:37:18,401
<i>...has become
a rogue nuclear power...</i>

1568
01:37:18,561 --> 01:37:21,521
<i>...at what point do I take action
and step in...</i>

1569
01:37:21,681 --> 01:37:24,041
<i>perhaps even with
a pre-emptive nuclear strike?</i>

1570
01:37:26,961 --> 01:37:29,201
Brought you a present.

1571
01:37:29,361 --> 01:37:30,921
It's the tourist's daughter.

1572
01:37:32,281 --> 01:37:33,961
Well, hello, hello.

1573
01:37:40,321 --> 01:37:42,441
Good morning, Mr. Cale.

1574
01:37:42,601 --> 01:37:45,521
<i>I'm sitting here with someone
who would like to say hello to you.</i>

1575
01:37:45,681 --> 01:37:47,281
Say hello, sweetie.

1576
01:37:54,721 --> 01:37:55,761
Say hello, sweetie.

1577
01:37:58,161 --> 01:38:01,761
All right, then,
would you like to tell your father...

1578
01:38:01,921 --> 01:38:04,921
...what Mr. Stenz here
is holding in his hand?

1579
01:38:06,521 --> 01:38:09,201
<i>- A gun.</i>
- Now, Mr. Cale...

1580
01:38:09,361 --> 01:38:10,921
...I'm gonna start counting here...

1581
01:38:11,081 --> 01:38:15,241
...and if you don't give the president to
my men by the time I've reached three...

1582
01:38:15,401 --> 01:38:19,801
<i>...Mr. Stenz here is gonna shoot
your little girl in the stomach.</i>

1583
01:38:22,801 --> 01:38:23,761
One.

1584
01:38:29,521 --> 01:38:31,121
<i>Two.</i>

1585
01:38:34,681 --> 01:38:36,961
No. No. No.

1586
01:38:39,921 --> 01:38:41,801
I'm here.

1587
01:38:43,201 --> 01:38:45,481
Guess Daddy
doesn't love you after all.

1588
01:38:49,281 --> 01:38:50,481
<i>We got the president.</i>

1589
01:38:52,921 --> 01:38:56,081
- Bring him on down.
- Back to your office, sir.

1590
01:39:01,601 --> 01:39:03,361
I have John Cale on the line, sir.

1591
01:39:03,521 --> 01:39:04,561
<i>Cale?</i>

1592
01:39:04,721 --> 01:39:07,081
You put her on the goddamn phone
right now.

1593
01:39:08,041 --> 01:39:09,681
- Hi, John.
- They have the president.

1594
01:39:09,841 --> 01:39:12,521
John, I want you to listen to me.
Help is not coming.

1595
01:39:12,681 --> 01:39:16,081
- I said they have the president.
- They called a strike on the White House.

1596
01:39:16,241 --> 01:39:18,641
The vice president is dead.
You need to get out.

1597
01:39:18,801 --> 01:39:21,961
They cannot do that. They still
have hostages, they still have Emily.

1598
01:39:22,121 --> 01:39:24,641
<i>I'm so, so sorry.
I was wrong about you...</i>

1599
01:39:24,801 --> 01:39:27,961
...but there's nothing you can do, John.
If you stay, you're gonna die.

1600
01:39:28,121 --> 01:39:30,921
I need you to listen to me.
My little girl is counting on me...

1601
01:39:31,081 --> 01:39:33,001
...and I am not gonna disappear
on her.

1602
01:39:33,161 --> 01:39:35,241
<i>So you tell me how much time I have.</i>

1603
01:39:37,241 --> 01:39:40,241
You only have eight minutes left
to get them out.

1604
01:39:40,401 --> 01:39:41,761
Goodbye, Carol.

1605
01:39:45,681 --> 01:39:47,641
Clear out! We're moving back now!

1606
01:39:47,801 --> 01:39:50,201
Everybody's gotta move back!
Everybody move back!

1607
01:39:50,361 --> 01:39:53,041
What do you mean, evacuate?
My daughter is in that building!

1608
01:39:54,001 --> 01:39:56,481
This is an emergency. Move back now!

1609
01:39:56,641 --> 01:39:58,641
Please! Clear the area now!

1610
01:40:00,801 --> 01:40:04,241
Move back now!
I said move back now!

1611
01:40:05,601 --> 01:40:06,801
Okay.

1612
01:40:09,521 --> 01:40:11,681
Oh, there I am.
That's not a bad picture.

1613
01:40:13,841 --> 01:40:15,761
How'd they find out I did that one?

1614
01:40:18,281 --> 01:40:19,401
Buh-bye.

1615
01:40:20,161 --> 01:40:24,201
Whatever happened to
"the pen is mightier than the sword"?

1616
01:40:26,321 --> 01:40:28,601
Martin, as the president
of the United States...

1617
01:40:28,761 --> 01:40:32,841
...this comes with the full weight,
power and authority of my office:

1618
01:40:33,361 --> 01:40:34,761
Fuck you.

1619
01:40:38,801 --> 01:40:42,481
- You okay?
- Can we get down to business now?

1620
01:40:43,241 --> 01:40:45,041
I'm gonna need you
to open this for me.

1621
01:40:46,161 --> 01:40:47,841
- What is that?
- Oh, what are you doing?

1622
01:40:48,001 --> 01:40:49,841
This is the nuclear football, sweetie.

1623
01:40:50,001 --> 01:40:55,081
It is keyed to the blood type
and heartbeat of the president.

1624
01:40:55,241 --> 01:40:57,361
- What the hell is this?
- This is the deal.

1625
01:41:00,281 --> 01:41:02,481
There's a dozen reasons
why that's not gonna work.

1626
01:41:02,641 --> 01:41:05,201
- Such as?
- Even if I open it, my codes are useless.

1627
01:41:05,361 --> 01:41:08,401
They switched them out
once you took over the building.

1628
01:41:08,561 --> 01:41:10,441
You let me worry about that.

1629
01:41:11,721 --> 01:41:15,681
There's not a day that goes by that I don't
feel terrible about losing your boy.

1630
01:41:15,841 --> 01:41:17,601
But that's on me.

1631
01:41:17,761 --> 01:41:20,681
So if you want revenge,
then just shoot me.

1632
01:41:20,841 --> 01:41:23,761
You think I blame you
for Kevin's death?

1633
01:41:24,241 --> 01:41:26,561
Sending those men in
was the most courageous thing...

1634
01:41:26,721 --> 01:41:28,201
...you ever did in your life.

1635
01:41:28,361 --> 01:41:31,921
You were a true commander in chief
for five minutes.

1636
01:41:32,081 --> 01:41:36,241
You just don't have the balls
to see the mission through.

1637
01:41:36,401 --> 01:41:37,801
What mission?

1638
01:41:37,961 --> 01:41:40,801
- There were no nuclear weapons in Iran.
- But there will be.

1639
01:41:42,281 --> 01:41:44,841
The Middle East is our last war.

1640
01:41:45,001 --> 01:41:48,481
It will be us or them.

1641
01:41:48,641 --> 01:41:52,721
I choose that Kevin Charles Walker
will be the last American soldier...

1642
01:41:52,881 --> 01:41:55,401
...to die in that conflict in vain.

1643
01:41:55,561 --> 01:41:56,961
You want that as your son's legacy?

1644
01:41:57,121 --> 01:41:58,961
Murdering millions of people
in his name?

1645
01:41:59,121 --> 01:42:03,281
Mr. President, I wish the pen
were mightier than the sword, I do.

1646
01:42:03,801 --> 01:42:05,361
But it's just a dream.

1647
01:42:05,521 --> 01:42:06,801
Stand up, sir.

1648
01:42:06,961 --> 01:42:12,801
History will judge who the true patriots
were here today.

1649
01:42:13,521 --> 01:42:18,001
I've been standing up, Martin,
and I'm not gonna open that.

1650
01:42:27,801 --> 01:42:29,041
Martin.

1651
01:42:30,761 --> 01:42:33,281
Martin, that's not necessary.

1652
01:42:33,441 --> 01:42:34,481
Martin!

1653
01:42:41,801 --> 01:42:43,441
How about now?

1654
01:42:45,761 --> 01:42:47,401
I can't open this for him.

1655
01:42:48,001 --> 01:42:51,841
If I do, millions of people are gonna die,
you understand that?

1656
01:42:53,521 --> 01:42:55,361
I understand.

1657
01:42:59,441 --> 01:43:01,441
Goddamn it!

1658
01:43:03,401 --> 01:43:05,161
Tyler, what the hell is going on?

1659
01:43:05,321 --> 01:43:08,921
We got thermal alarms going off
in the second-floor dining room...

1660
01:43:09,081 --> 01:43:11,601
...the West Sitting Hall,
and the president's bedroom.

1661
01:43:11,761 --> 01:43:14,761
Killick, he's trying to burn the place.
Second floor. Send your men.

1662
01:43:23,441 --> 01:43:27,361
Tyler? Turn off
the goddamn sprinklers!

1663
01:43:28,921 --> 01:43:30,601
Who makes this shit?

1664
01:43:50,161 --> 01:43:51,441
Oh, shit!

1665
01:43:55,401 --> 01:43:56,641
What was that?

1666
01:44:05,081 --> 01:44:06,961
I've been waiting all day to kill you.

1667
01:44:11,361 --> 01:44:16,881
Stop hurting my White House!

1668
01:44:18,441 --> 01:44:23,081
German mantle clock. Empire style.

1669
01:44:23,881 --> 01:44:25,361
<i>Killick, report!</i>

1670
01:44:26,241 --> 01:44:28,681
Killick, what the hell is happening?
Report!

1671
01:44:28,841 --> 01:44:31,401
Killick can't come to the phone.
Where's my daughter?

1672
01:44:31,561 --> 01:44:32,961
- Dad!
- She's here with me...

1673
01:44:33,121 --> 01:44:36,561
...in the Oval Office, so why
don't you come down and get her?

1674
01:44:36,721 --> 01:44:38,801
- What are you gonna do?
- What do you think?

1675
01:44:39,321 --> 01:44:41,041
Why do you make
all this shit personal?

1676
01:44:41,201 --> 01:44:43,081
Oh, you're talking to me
about personal...

1677
01:44:43,241 --> 01:44:45,921
...when you wanna blow up
half the world for your kid!

1678
01:44:46,081 --> 01:44:48,881
- What are you gonna do?
- What I should've done in the beginning.

1679
01:44:49,041 --> 01:44:50,801
- I'm gonna kill this prick.
- Hey!

1680
01:44:50,961 --> 01:44:52,801
- What?
- You lied to all of us.

1681
01:44:52,961 --> 01:44:54,641
This was not the job.

1682
01:44:54,801 --> 01:44:57,161
I got business to finish. You stay here.

1683
01:44:57,481 --> 01:45:00,761
- How do I get to the Oval Office?
- Take the stairs to the ground floor...

1684
01:45:00,921 --> 01:45:02,801
...you go to the end
of the West Colonnade.

1685
01:45:02,961 --> 01:45:05,201
There's an air strike coming!
Get them out of here.

1686
01:45:05,361 --> 01:45:06,641
Go!

1687
01:45:07,321 --> 01:45:09,041
You heard the man!

1688
01:45:09,961 --> 01:45:11,401
Tour's over.

1689
01:45:31,841 --> 01:45:33,801
I didn't sign up for this nuclear bullshit.

1690
01:45:33,961 --> 01:45:36,561
I'm gonna go and I'm gonna
get the money myself.

1691
01:45:36,721 --> 01:45:39,201
- Hey! Hey!
- What?

1692
01:45:40,161 --> 01:45:43,041
You think I put my country
through this for money?

1693
01:45:45,601 --> 01:45:47,521
I hate mercenaries.

1694
01:45:51,921 --> 01:45:53,841
It's about time.

1695
01:45:54,601 --> 01:45:56,001
I choose the pen!

1696
01:45:59,241 --> 01:46:01,921
Come here. Get up. Up!

1697
01:46:02,081 --> 01:46:03,561
Put your hand...

1698
01:46:03,721 --> 01:46:05,001
<i>Weapon system unlocked.</i>

1699
01:46:06,121 --> 01:46:08,681
<i>Enter presidential launch code.</i>

1700
01:46:08,841 --> 01:46:11,921
Mr. President,
please wake up, wake up. Please!

1701
01:46:16,201 --> 01:46:17,241
Sir, we're at DEFCON 1.

1702
01:46:17,401 --> 01:46:19,601
The nuclear football
in the White House went live.

1703
01:46:19,761 --> 01:46:21,321
- That's impossible.
- It's happening.

1704
01:46:21,481 --> 01:46:23,281
Someone has entered
valid launch codes.

1705
01:46:26,201 --> 01:46:28,521
- Captain on deck!
- What the hell is going on?

1706
01:46:28,681 --> 01:46:31,881
- All 24 of our nuclear missiles went live.
- This can't be right.

1707
01:46:34,001 --> 01:46:36,881
Sir, we have nuclear missiles
spinning up on the <i>Albuquerque.</i>

1708
01:46:37,041 --> 01:46:40,481
If our allies see us launching a full-scale
nuclear strike, they will respond.

1709
01:46:40,641 --> 01:46:43,161
Russia and China will launch.
We'll have World War Ill...

1710
01:46:43,321 --> 01:46:46,401
- ...unless you level the White House.
- Four minutes to target!

1711
01:46:46,561 --> 01:46:49,281
I need a final go-no go
for payload delivery.

1712
01:46:49,441 --> 01:46:51,121
God forgive me. Go.

1713
01:46:51,281 --> 01:46:53,921
- Go!
<i>- Raptor Alpha 1, Operation Free Castle...</i>

1714
01:46:54,081 --> 01:46:56,881
<i>- ...is a go.</i>
- Copy that. Dropping to attack altitude.

1715
01:47:06,001 --> 01:47:08,721
Cale, Walker's trying to launch
a nuclear attack.

1716
01:47:08,881 --> 01:47:10,721
<i>If he does, it'll start World War III.</i>

1717
01:47:10,881 --> 01:47:12,481
<i>- You have to stop him.</i>
- What?

1718
01:47:14,921 --> 01:47:17,361
Cale? Cale?

1719
01:47:20,401 --> 01:47:21,801
Head to the South Lawn!

1720
01:47:21,961 --> 01:47:25,761
Almost there. Come on.
Come on. Come on!

1721
01:47:27,441 --> 01:47:28,721
I'm gonna enjoy this.

1722
01:47:31,201 --> 01:47:33,761
<i>Confirm: Bandar Abbas.</i>

1723
01:47:35,121 --> 01:47:37,601
<i>Chah Bahar targeted.</i>

1724
01:47:37,761 --> 01:47:39,361
<i>Confirm Chah Bahar.</i>

1725
01:47:47,321 --> 01:47:48,961
- Go! Leave, leave, leave!
- No, no!

1726
01:47:49,121 --> 01:47:51,121
- Not without my dad!
- Go, go, go!

1727
01:48:00,361 --> 01:48:02,721
Your little bitch says
you're gonna put me in jail!

1728
01:48:12,041 --> 01:48:14,481
Come on, Martin. This isn't you.

1729
01:48:14,641 --> 01:48:18,321
You protected presidents
for the past 25 years.

1730
01:48:19,481 --> 01:48:21,201
What are you gonna do?

1731
01:48:21,361 --> 01:48:22,801
You really gonna shoot me?

1732
01:48:25,041 --> 01:48:26,561
All right.

1733
01:48:30,921 --> 01:48:31,921
Yes.

1734
01:48:38,161 --> 01:48:39,281
He deserved it.

1735
01:48:40,121 --> 01:48:42,121
You killed him!

1736
01:48:42,281 --> 01:48:44,041
Get back. Get over here.

1737
01:48:44,201 --> 01:48:46,001
Get in the room or I'll knock you out!

1738
01:48:46,161 --> 01:48:48,201
And do as you're told.
Go on, sit down!

1739
01:48:57,321 --> 01:48:59,561
I'm gonna carve my name on your chest!

1740
01:49:10,001 --> 01:49:12,361
No jail for you, you little bitch!

1741
01:49:13,201 --> 01:49:14,961
No! No!

1742
01:49:17,681 --> 01:49:19,201
Get it off!

1743
01:49:22,761 --> 01:49:26,321
<i>There was an enormous explosion
in the vicinity of the West Wing.</i>

1744
01:49:26,481 --> 01:49:29,001
<i>A huge ball of flames
has burst into the sky.</i>

1745
01:49:29,161 --> 01:49:32,241
<i>- It's got to be more than 100 feet...
Raptor Alpha 1, you are clear.</i>

1746
01:49:32,401 --> 01:49:34,801
Delta 2-6, copy that.
Two minutes to target.

1747
01:49:39,881 --> 01:49:41,601
- Clear the area.
- Get back in there!

1748
01:49:41,761 --> 01:49:44,521
The Department of Homeland Security...

1749
01:49:45,681 --> 01:49:47,001
Get in there!

1750
01:49:47,161 --> 01:49:49,921
This is a mandatory evacuation...

1751
01:49:55,921 --> 01:49:57,401
Emily.

1752
01:49:58,241 --> 01:50:01,201
No, please, please, baby.
Look at me. I'm right here.

1753
01:50:01,361 --> 01:50:05,601
<i>Tabriz targeted. Confirm Tabriz.</i>

1754
01:50:06,521 --> 01:50:08,961
Please, baby, you gotta
turn around and look at me.

1755
01:50:09,121 --> 01:50:11,041
Damn it.

1756
01:50:11,201 --> 01:50:14,881
Evacuate this area immediately!
We need you to move back, people!

1757
01:50:15,041 --> 01:50:16,401
- Move back now!
- Emily!

1758
01:50:16,561 --> 01:50:18,601
Get out of here!
There's an air strike coming!

1759
01:50:18,761 --> 01:50:22,041
- My daughter was in there. Emily Cale.
- She's still in there. Wait!

1760
01:50:22,201 --> 01:50:25,361
- Emily!
- What is with this family? Wait for me!

1761
01:50:25,521 --> 01:50:28,241
<i>Confirm Tehran.</i>

1762
01:50:28,401 --> 01:50:30,801
<i>Targeting complete.</i>

1763
01:50:30,961 --> 01:50:33,001
<i>Armed for nuclear launch.</i>

<i>You have 15 seconds to initiate.</i>

<i>- Five...</i>

<i>- ...two...</i>
- Get down!

1771
01:50:56,041 --> 01:50:57,441
<i>...one.</i>

1772
01:51:04,241 --> 01:51:06,401
<i>Confirmation timed out.</i>

1773
01:51:06,561 --> 01:51:09,601
Delta 2-6, one minute to target.
Go weapons hot.

1774
01:51:10,201 --> 01:51:11,961
- Thank God, Em.
- Daddy, I love you.

1775
01:51:12,121 --> 01:51:13,161
You're okay.

1776
01:51:13,321 --> 01:51:16,081
- I love you so much.
- The president. He shot him!

1777
01:51:16,241 --> 01:51:17,681
He shot him in there.

1778
01:51:19,401 --> 01:51:21,001
Look, I need you to listen to me.

1779
01:51:21,161 --> 01:51:23,281
There's an air strike coming,
I need you to run.

1780
01:51:23,441 --> 01:51:26,081
I need you to run as far and as fast
as you can possibly go.

1781
01:51:26,241 --> 01:51:28,121
Can you do that?
I gotta get the president.

1782
01:51:28,281 --> 01:51:30,441
- Okay.
- You gotta go for me. Now, go.

1783
01:51:30,601 --> 01:51:33,281
<i>Hundreds of people seem to be
running toward the White House.</i>

1784
01:51:33,441 --> 01:51:37,361
<i>They've been told to evacuate too,
but they're climbing the fence.</i>

1785
01:51:37,521 --> 01:51:41,681
<i>Okay, we have confirmation. President
Raphelson has ordered an air strike...</i>

1786
01:51:41,841 --> 01:51:45,041
<i>...on the White House,
and I can hear the planes coming.</i>

1787
01:51:45,201 --> 01:51:46,801
<i>I... I have to go. I'm sorry.</i>

1788
01:51:46,961 --> 01:51:49,521
<i>Delta 2-6, requesting permission
to deliver payload.</i>

1789
01:51:49,681 --> 01:51:51,201
<i>Raptor Alpha 1, you are clear.</i>

1790
01:51:51,361 --> 01:51:53,361
<i>All right, guys, let's clean it up.</i>

1791
01:51:54,881 --> 01:51:58,801
Delta 2-6, we're locked on target.
Please confirm Free Castle is a go.

1792
01:51:58,961 --> 01:52:01,361
<i>Raptor Alpha 1, clear.
Mission is a go.</i>

1793
01:52:04,361 --> 01:52:06,961
Delta 2-6, we have friendlies
all over the kill zone.

1794
01:52:07,121 --> 01:52:10,961
<i>I cannot see the planes, but what
I can see is an unbelievable sight.</i>

1795
01:52:11,121 --> 01:52:14,561
<i>Emily Cale is out on the lawn,
and she's waving the presidential flag.</i>

1796
01:52:14,721 --> 01:52:16,881
No, baby. No, I told you to run!
You gotta run!

1797
01:52:17,041 --> 01:52:20,121
Captain, do you see this? Delta 2-6,
we have a young girl on the lawn.

1798
01:52:20,281 --> 01:52:22,401
I think she's trying to wave off
the air strike.

1799
01:52:22,561 --> 01:52:25,241
<i>- Sir, requesting permission to abort.</i>
- Mr. President, please.

1800

Sir! Sir! I need an answer.

1801
01:52:28,001 --> 01:52:32,401
I'm not doing this, guys. Abort mission.
Pull out! Abort! Abort! Abort!

1802
01:52:33,681 --> 01:52:34,881
No!

1803
01:52:36,561 --> 01:52:38,401
<i>They have flown
over the White House.</i>

1804
01:52:38,561 --> 01:52:40,721
<i>It is an unbelievable moment
down here.</i>

1805
01:52:40,881 --> 01:52:42,321
<i>People are going wild.</i>

1806
01:52:42,481 --> 01:52:46,721
<i>And Emily Cale is undoubtedly
a beautiful hero of the day.</i>

1807
01:52:46,881 --> 01:52:48,681
<i>Emily Cale is a little hero.</i>

1808
01:52:48,841 --> 01:52:51,921
<i>This is an unprecedented moment
in U.S. history.</i>

1809
01:53:08,481 --> 01:53:10,481
That search you requested
came back.

1810
01:53:14,361 --> 01:53:18,241
<i>Emily, can you believe how many people
have seen your video blog?</i>

1811
01:53:18,401 --> 01:53:20,681
<i>It's not a video blog.
It's a YouTube channel.</i>

1812
01:53:20,841 --> 01:53:23,841
<i>- How many?
- Seven hundred million people.</i>

1813
01:53:24,001 --> 01:53:25,601
Daughters.

1814
01:53:25,761 --> 01:53:26,961
Jesus!

1815
01:53:27,521 --> 01:53:29,281
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

1816
01:53:30,881 --> 01:53:33,441
Honest Abe. My wife got this for me.

1817
01:53:33,601 --> 01:53:35,401
For the inauguration.

1818
01:53:38,921 --> 01:53:40,961
Are you kidding me?
You got shot in the wa...?

1819
01:53:41,121 --> 01:53:45,601
What I'm telling you is that good old Abe
took a second bullet for me.

1820
01:53:49,961 --> 01:53:51,441
Thank you.

1821
01:53:52,241 --> 01:53:54,441
Thank you for what you did for Emily.

1822
01:53:54,961 --> 01:53:56,401
It's my sacrifice, right?

1823
01:53:57,681 --> 01:53:58,801
Yes, sir.

1824
01:54:04,561 --> 01:54:05,561
Yep.

1825
01:54:05,721 --> 01:54:07,801
John, listen.

1826
01:54:07,961 --> 01:54:09,201
This isn't over yet.

1827
01:54:09,361 --> 01:54:10,881
<i>Walker had no prior contact...</i>

1828
01:54:11,041 --> 01:54:13,521
<i>with any of the terrorists,
but someone else did.</i>

1829
01:54:13,681 --> 01:54:16,441
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.
I'm gonna put you on speaker.

1830
01:54:16,601 --> 01:54:18,841
- The president's with me.
<i>- This guy, Stenz...</i>

1831
01:54:19,001 --> 01:54:21,121
<i>...made multiple calls
to a secure line in D.C...</i>

1832
01:54:21,281 --> 01:54:25,001
<i>...but we don't know who received them.
The database was wiped 30 minutes ago.</i>

1833
01:54:25,161 --> 01:54:27,281
<i>Really? Did you check Walker's
personal records?</i>

1834
01:54:27,441 --> 01:54:29,681
<i>His computer, his e-mails?</i>

1835
01:54:29,841 --> 01:54:31,881
<i>You don't know Walker, John.
He was a dinosaur.</i>

1836
01:54:32,041 --> 01:54:34,401
<i>The man still used a pager.</i>

1837
01:54:34,961 --> 01:54:36,281
Oh, shit.

1838
01:54:39,161 --> 01:54:41,681
Listen. Carol,
I got to check something out.

1839
01:54:41,841 --> 01:54:43,241
We'll see you outside.

1840
01:54:46,481 --> 01:54:47,921
I don't believe it.

1841
01:54:48,081 --> 01:54:52,681
I think I know how Walker got the codes,
but I'm gonna need your help, sir.

1842
01:54:58,721 --> 01:55:00,561
Move back! Move back.

1843
01:55:00,721 --> 01:55:01,841
Emily.

1844
01:55:03,761 --> 01:55:07,361
Oh, baby, you okay?
Oh, thank God.

1845
01:55:07,521 --> 01:55:09,041
Thank God, baby.

1846
01:55:15,641 --> 01:55:18,641
- Did you see my routine?
- Yeah.

1847
01:55:18,801 --> 01:55:23,441
Oh, I'm so proud of you.
You were beautiful, baby.

1848
01:55:23,601 --> 01:55:26,321
You saved us. You know that?

1849
01:55:28,521 --> 01:55:31,681
Hey, stay with Mommy for a second,
okay? I'll be right back.

1850
01:55:34,721 --> 01:55:37,281
- John.
- It's disarmed.

1851
01:55:37,441 --> 01:55:39,881
Thank God you're all right.
Where's the president?

1852
01:55:42,321 --> 01:55:43,441
He didn't make it, sir.

1853
01:55:49,401 --> 01:55:51,521
I need to address the nation.

1854
01:55:51,681 --> 01:55:53,841
General, get on with the Joint Chiefs.

1855
01:55:54,001 --> 01:55:57,361
We need to move our troops into
the Middle East to stabilise the region.

1856
01:55:57,521 --> 01:55:59,041
You wanna move troops in?

1857
01:55:59,201 --> 01:56:01,961
When they find out that we almost
launched a nuclear attack...

1858
01:56:02,121 --> 01:56:04,401
...there's gonna be chaos.
We have to contain it.

1859
01:56:04,561 --> 01:56:07,561
- Can I ask you a question?
- Of course. Yeah.

1860
01:56:07,721 --> 01:56:09,881
When did you and Walker
cook this whole thing up?

1861
01:56:10,041 --> 01:56:11,121
- Excuse me?
- How'd it go?

1862
01:56:11,281 --> 01:56:13,841
You gave Walker the launch codes
and he made you president?

1863
01:56:15,161 --> 01:56:16,201
You can prove this?

1864
01:56:18,961 --> 01:56:21,841
Well, Walker had to get the launch codes
from somewhere...

1865
01:56:22,001 --> 01:56:24,201
...and you were the only person
with those codes.

1866
01:56:24,881 --> 01:56:26,801
And I found this pager
in Walker's pocket.

1867
01:56:26,961 --> 01:56:29,441
I only know one other person
that uses one of these.

1868
01:56:31,161 --> 01:56:32,961
That doesn't prove anything.

1869
01:56:33,121 --> 01:56:35,401
Two old guys use old technology.
So what?

1870
01:56:36,681 --> 01:56:40,041
Why don't you call the return number
on that, Carol?

1871
01:56:43,481 --> 01:56:46,161
Would have been better
if the evidence had been destroyed...

1872
01:56:46,321 --> 01:56:48,081
...in the air strike that you ordered.

1873
01:56:54,641 --> 01:56:56,161
You're a goddamn traitor, sir.

1874
01:56:59,121 --> 01:57:00,681
You dim little shit.

1875
01:57:00,841 --> 01:57:03,761
I hired you out of pity
and this is how you repay me.

1876
01:57:03,921 --> 01:57:06,881
Tomorrow, when people find out
that your precious president...

1877
01:57:07,041 --> 01:57:09,361
...helped a maniac
open the nuclear football...

1878
01:57:09,521 --> 01:57:12,081
...who do you think they're
going to believe, you or me?

1879
01:57:12,241 --> 01:57:14,281
You, you would be a nobody.

1880
01:57:14,441 --> 01:57:17,361
But me, I'm the president
of the United States.

1881
01:57:17,521 --> 01:57:18,921
No, you're not.

1882
01:57:20,241 --> 01:57:22,161
Eli, Eli.

1883
01:57:22,321 --> 01:57:24,081
Quite the politician, huh?

1884
01:57:24,241 --> 01:57:27,841
You did all of this just to keep your
buddies in the defence industry happy.

1885
01:57:28,001 --> 01:57:29,801
How far did you fall into their pockets?

1886
01:57:29,961 --> 01:57:31,241
This is ridiculous.

1887
01:57:31,401 --> 01:57:33,961
- Take him into custody, general.
- Yes, sir, Mr. President.

1888
01:57:34,121 --> 01:57:36,241
No, I'm still president.
I am still president.

1889
01:57:36,401 --> 01:57:39,361
Well, just consider this a coup d'état.
Get this trash off my lawn.

1890
01:57:39,521 --> 01:57:42,081
You're not fit for office.
You son of a bitch!

1891
01:57:42,241 --> 01:57:44,241
You're selling this country
out to the Arabs.

1892
01:57:44,401 --> 01:57:45,801
This isn't over. I got friends.

1893
01:57:45,961 --> 01:57:48,681
And I'll make sure all of your friends
meet you in prison.

1894
01:57:49,361 --> 01:57:50,921
Let's get him to the hospital.

1895
01:57:53,281 --> 01:57:56,081
You okay? You look terrible.

1896
01:57:57,081 --> 01:57:59,281
Thank you for everything
you did today.

1897
01:58:00,881 --> 01:58:02,161
Thank you for trusting me.

1898
01:58:02,321 --> 01:58:03,761
Special Agent Cale!

1899
01:58:03,921 --> 01:58:06,201
I'm not going anywhere
without my protection.

1900
01:58:09,321 --> 01:58:10,321
You heard him.

1901
01:58:23,441 --> 01:58:25,641
Thank you, sir. Hey, Em!

1902
01:58:27,161 --> 01:58:28,721
You wanna take a ride?

1903
01:58:30,161 --> 01:58:31,721
Come on.

1904
01:58:32,721 --> 01:58:33,921
- Can I go?
- Yeah, of course.

1905
01:58:34,081 --> 01:58:35,601
Go with your father.

1906
01:58:45,841 --> 01:58:47,481
She's an amazing girl.

1907
01:58:47,641 --> 01:58:50,321
This way! Move this way!

1908
01:58:51,761 --> 01:58:54,601
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you, sir.

1909
01:58:54,761 --> 01:58:56,001
You sure you're all right?

1910
01:58:56,161 --> 01:58:57,801
I'm all right now.

1911
01:58:57,961 --> 01:59:00,201
Good job, special agent.

1912
01:59:00,361 --> 01:59:02,401
Thank you, general.

1913
01:59:13,201 --> 01:59:16,281
If you ever want a private tour
of the White House, just let me know.

1914
01:59:16,441 --> 01:59:19,041
I can hook it up like that.
I mean, maybe in a few weeks...

1915
01:59:19,201 --> 01:59:20,774
...when we've got
the place back together.

1916
01:59:20,841 --> 01:59:22,321
That's good to know.

1917
01:59:27,121 --> 01:59:28,721
You wanna give him the news?

1918
01:59:28,881 --> 01:59:32,001
Calls have been coming in
from all over the globe for the last hour.

1919
01:59:32,161 --> 01:59:36,561
The presidents of Iran, Russia, Israel
and France have all agreed to your terms.

1920
01:59:36,721 --> 01:59:38,801
It looks like your peace plan is a go.

1921
01:59:38,961 --> 01:59:41,961
You keep this up,
I just might have to vote for you.

1922
01:59:42,121 --> 01:59:44,081
You wanna see something
really special?

1923
01:59:44,241 --> 01:59:47,081
- Yeah.
- Carol.

1924
01:59:49,841 --> 01:59:52,721
Henry, the president
wants to do the thing.

1925
01:59:54,401 --> 01:59:55,441
Hold on tight.
