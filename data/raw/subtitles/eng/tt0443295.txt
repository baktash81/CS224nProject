1
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:12,028
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
Move it! Move it! Move it!

2
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:13,469
Move it! Move it! Move it!

3
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,871
That means you, too, Ethan.
Head ashore, sailor.

4
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:17,806
Aye, aye, sir. Head ashore!

5
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:20,438
<i>I don't know, but I've been told!</i>

6
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:22,981
<i>Coast Guard kids got lots of soul!</i>

7
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,710
<i>- Sound off
- One, two</i>

8
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:27,810
- I get the top bunk because I'm older.
- By two minutes.

9
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,822
You know, when I was an ensign,
I always had the bottom bunk.

10
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:34,485
- Did the guy above you wet his bed?
- Good point.

11
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:37,220
<i>- Sound off
- Three, four</i>

12
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,127
Do they have girls' boxing
at our new school?

13
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:40,221
I hope not.

14
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,426
Does not complaining
about the move from San Diego...

15
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:43,763
count as my good deed for today?

16
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,303
I'd sign off on that.

17
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:49,000
Admiral,
this is our 12th move in my lifetime.

18
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,772
I admire your record-keeping, Harry.
First-rate ship's log.

19
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,138
William, what have you got there?

20
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:59,480
Academy applications, SAT forms,
Capitol Hill summer internship forms...

21
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:02,180
and the number of the girl
two houses down.

22
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:04,256
- Outstanding.
- One, two.

23
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:07,585
- So that's Christina Beardsley.
- Christina!

24
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:10,288
The zip is 06320.

25
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:15,265
Christina, we have just moved here.
Who could you possibly be talking to?

26
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:18,428
J. Crew. I wanna make sure
they change all my shipping information.

27
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:21,598
<i>- Sound off
- Three, four</i>

28
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:25,808
Well, Mrs. Munion,
what do you think of Connecticut?

29
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:29,609
I'm delighted to be here
in the birthplace of Lyme disease.

30
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,815
I see
we're not unpacking our suitcase again.

31
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:38,982
Not until you guarantee
this is our last move.

32
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,150
You're gonna like New London, Harry.

33
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,490
I used to live here when I was a kid.

34
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:47,498
- You were a kid?
- Yeah.

35
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:52,872
Hey, I didn't hear anything
about that guarantee.

36
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:55,998
Well, Son,
you know the life of a military brat.

37
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:58,509
New places, new adventures.

38
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,579
This isn't our last move, is it?

39
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,206
No, this is just one stopover
on our way to D.C.

40
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:05,807
Someday our dad is gonna be...

41
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,683
Commandant of
the entire U.S. Coast Guard.

42
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:10,722
Someday I am gonna be...

43
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:13,053
the Commandant
of the entire U.S. Coast Guard...

44
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:17,118
so don't piss me off.
Unpack your suitcase.

45
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,456
Yes, sir.

46
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,743
Admiral, look at that!

47
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:42,321
Fiona, come back!

48
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:43,980
Fiona, you're not supposed to eat pizza!

49
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,355
- Looks like a nuthouse.
- It looks like fun.

50
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:50,095
There's no ham on it.

51
00:03:58,137 --> 00:03:59,434
Come back!

52
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:02,464
Oh, Max, I'm so excited.

53
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,839
If you get me this private line
at Saks Fifth Avenue...

54
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:07,572
I will love you forever. This is cute, huh?

55
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,950
Yes, thank you. This one is great.

56
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,245
I should really get going
if I'm gonna make that meeting.

57
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:15,184
<i>I'm sorry.
Do you have to keep doing that?</i>

58
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:17,119
It's in my soul. Don't look at the camera.

59
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:19,919
Naoko, just back off a little bit.
Give him a little room.

60
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:22,119
- Do a master shot, okay?
- Fine.

61
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:25,254
Hello. Excuse me.
You wanna hear my new song?

62
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:28,465
Okay, rock on. Yes!

63
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:30,433
Mommy's gonna listen
to the rest of this song...

64
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:32,231
when your mom and I
are finished with work.

65
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:34,932
- Here you go.
- It was great, Phoebe.

66
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,773
Helen, I gotta tell you,
I think we're set here.

67
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:39,970
No, just one more, Max.
I was thinking about this one.

68
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:42,377
- I mean, I don't know. Lau.
- Yeah?

69
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:45,073
- What do you think of this one, honey?
- Please!

70
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:48,278
It needs a little swag.
A scooch of Gucci.

71
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:53,190
Like this, but in gold.

72
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:55,394
No one will ever doubt you're my son.

73
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:58,020
- Mom!
- What?

74
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,927
- He's painting our roses again.
- It's art.

75
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:04,629
You can't call it art
unless you have talent.

76
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:06,204
That's just tagging.

77
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:09,367
Helen, really, I have got to go.
I think we're really good.

78
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:10,942
<i>I really should be getting out of here.</i>

79
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:14,309
Max, just give me one second. I love
this one. Just need one second, okay?

80
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:16,314
Mom,
there's something wrong with my sax.

81
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,781
What is it, honey?

82
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:22,054
- Okay, I'll be right back.
- Sounds the same to me.

83
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,518
What's on my head? What's
on my head? What's on my head?

84
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,563
- Jimi, we found Rainbow!
- Don't let it bite me.

85
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,461
- Don't let it bite me.
- Where's Rainbow?

86
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:35,796
- Get it off!
- Here he is. Come here, Rainbow.

87
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:37,767
- Come here, Rainbow.
- Over there.

88
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,202
Hey, Max, thank you
for being so incredibly patient.

89
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:41,534
Get back here!

90
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,310
- This is fun.
- Fiona, come back.

91
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:46,571
Mom!

92
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:49,376
Aldo, are you okay?

93
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:50,949
I'm shiny, Mommy.

94
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,814
Yes, you are very shiny.

95
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:57,512
Max. Max, I am so sorry.

96
00:05:57,623 --> 00:05:59,682
It gets a little crazy
around here sometimes.

97
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:01,020
A little?

98
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,928
No, Helen, this is all terrific.

99
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,965
You're very talented,
and so are your 10 kids.

100
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:08,825
Thank you, Max.

101
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:11,495
Maybe our next meeting will be
a contract signing...

102
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:12,832
and maybe it'll be in the city.

103
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:14,702
Yeah. Sounds good.

104
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:18,102
- Hey, Max.
- Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

105
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,142
- See you, Max.
- Okay.

106
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:22,676
Okay, can you please explain to me...

107
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:26,980
why you just let that very single guy out
of here without even asking for a date?

108
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:30,681
Phoebe, what guy could
possibly deal with all of this?

109
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:43,129
Is this all yours, Admiral?

110
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:47,104
No, it belongs to the Coast Guard.
I'm just gonna run it for them.

111
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:50,198
- So it is all yours.
- Basically.

112
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,354
Frank! Frank.

113
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,563
- Good to see you, man.
- Good to see you, too, Darrell.

114
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,396
All right. "Mad Dog" Beardsley.

115
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:22,205
Who'd have thought they'd ever let
Frank "The Mad Dog" back here...

116
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:23,639
much less run the place?

117
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:27,110
- You remember my youngest, Ethan?
- Mad Dog Jr.

118
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:28,703
Can you give me a...

119
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,177
Captain.

120
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,676
You are out of control, little man.

121
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:37,381
- Request permission to play, Admiral?
- Permission granted.

122
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:41,758
I've seen Navy SEALs
not as well-trained.

123
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:45,126
Well, when there's eight of them
and one of you, it's your only hope.

124
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:47,791
It's Mad Dog Beardsley, the pirate.

125
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,891
Always on red alert with him.

126
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:52,797
Hey, Frank, are you dating at all yet?

127
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:54,736
No, no. Not yet.

128
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:57,639
'Cause I know this terrific gal
I'd love to set you up with.

129
00:07:57,743 --> 00:07:59,643
I know you'd like her.
She's too good for me.

130
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:01,337
No, Darrell. No, thanks.

131
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:04,905
All right. Well, just think about it,
that's all I'm saying.

132
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:06,746
- I'll think about it.
- All right.

133
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:40,114
<i>... winds out of the southeast
at 5 miles an hour.</i>

134
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:44,747
<i>The barometer right now is 30.27
and falling, air humidity 76%.</i>

135
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:48,588
<i>Now, there's a 20% chance of showers
for New London and points south.</i>

136
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:07,612
<i>Way to go, Paula!</i>

137
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,705
Way to go, Paula! You go!

138
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:15,011
- Why is Mommy crying?
- I think it's hormones.

139
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,451
- Mom!
- Here.

140
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,719
- Mom, do you have my algebra...
- I got it covered.

141
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:22,726
- Mom, can I have $5?
- In the chicks.

142
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:25,729
- Can you hand me that?
- Thank you for saving this.

143
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,133
All right, ladies, wanna go get dressed?

144
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,361
- Yeah.
- Come on, let's go upstairs. Come on.

145
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:32,061
- I'm out.
- Bye.

146
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:33,661
See you later, alligator.

147
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:35,172
Bye, Mommy.

148
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:36,434
Reunion cruise.

149
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,375
Oh, yeah,
like I have time to go on a cruise.

150
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:45,746
Mom! Mick's dog just puked on Aldo.

151
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,044
Sorry.

152
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,161
- I'm worried.
- Don't be, Eth.

153
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,327
I've done this a million times.
You'll be great.

154
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:07,768
Okay, guys, fan out.
William and I will take Ethan to pre-K.

155
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,738
All right. Everyone meet up here
afterwards, okay?

156
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,944
Come on, it'll be fine.

157
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,552
- I'm gonna get you!
- Superheroes, hurray!

158
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,094
- Superhero bouncers.
- Hey, watch out!

159
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:31,720
I thought you weren't interested in Max.

160
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:33,958
And I thought
you weren't gonna wear black anymore.

161
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:37,797
This isn't black. This is tie-dye.
And I'm not interested in Max.

162
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:40,770
I'm interested in that buyer
that he's bringing up from New York.

163
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:42,932
Oh, there it is. Thanks, Phoebe.

164
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,634
Why don't you just have them here?

165
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:48,043
Homes are for free expression,
not for good impressions.

166
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,580
Incoming!

167
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,482
If you catch my drift.

168
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:57,284
Are you sure
you wanna wear the uniform, Admiral?

169
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,358
Not that you don't look great.

170
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:02,689
It just looks so military.

171
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:05,025
She might as well know
what she's getting.

172
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:07,895
Okay,
but hold off on that eight-kid thing.

173
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,024
Why?

174
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:13,071
Because that's a minimum third-date,
second-bottle-of-wine announcement.

175
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:16,471
Hey, you know, believe it or not,
I have been on a few dates before...

176
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:17,803
a couple of decades ago.

177
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,241
- Admiral?
- Yeah.

178
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,405
Ethan, do you know
that you can call me Dad?

179
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,643
Oh. Admiral, is this lady gonna be
our new mom?

180
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:29,752
- I don't think so. It's just a blind date.
- She can't see?

181
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,983
Can she navigate using sonar,
like a bat?

182
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:36,323
Hey, why don't you guys go swimming
in the bathtub?

183
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,123
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Go ahead.

184
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,892
- I get the boat.
- Uh-uh, you get the duck.

185
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,991
- You get the duck.
- No.

186
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:46,605
Let's just give her a little hint
of what's underneath.

187
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:51,304
You know, Christina, sometimes
I wonder where you came from.

188
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:53,475
Mom's side.

189
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:57,615
- Don't wait up.
- I won't.

190
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:01,952
And so Otter, he says, "Is she blind?"

191
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,682
And Ely wants to know if you're a bat.

192
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:06,989
Because...

193
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,954
Would you like red or white?

194
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,259
- Red.
- Red it is.

195
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:17,533
Darrell would drink beer with everything.

196
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:22,471
I mean, if he could have
a keg with dinner, he would.

197
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,443
- Would you like to order? Waiter?
- Sure.

198
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:27,341
- I'll be right back.
- Sure.

199
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:32,782
See? Now that is the kind of thing
that would drive Darrell crazy.

200
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:35,718
"You're here now," he'd say,
"So take our order!"

201
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:40,048
You talk about Darrell a lot.

202
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,649
Well, yeah.

203
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:46,158
We were married for seven years.
He didn't tell you that?

204
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,000
Must have slipped his mind.

205
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:52,935
Yeah, well, that's just like him.
I'm gonna go hit the head.

206
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,804
Thank you so much.

207
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:06,011
- Helen?
- Frank.

208
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:09,210
- Helen?
- Frank Beardsley.

209
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:10,515
- Well, what are you...
- What are you...

210
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,989
- No, you first.
- No, you go first.

211
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:16,752
- Well, I'm having dinner with my...
- Hi, Frank. Max Algrant.

212
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:18,329
Pleased to meet you.

213
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:20,592
So, what are you doing back here?

214
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:23,429
- Sit down, sit down.
- Oh, yeah. Thank you.

215
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,561
Well, I've been back here forever.

216
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:27,662
I didn't want my kids growing up
in the whole...

217
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:29,764
you know,
New York money-status thing.

218
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,969
- Yeah, that thing. That's right.
- Yeah.

219
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:37,412
- So, are you in town for the reunion?
- No. I'm...

220
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:42,410
I moved my family back here.
I'm running the Coast Guard Academy.

221
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:44,484
- I'm an Admiral.
- Yeah.

222
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,218
- That's why I'm wearing the uniform.
- Yeah.

223
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,754
- An Admiral. Whoa.
- Yeah.

224
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:49,987
With a family.

225
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:53,826
- Well, you, too. It's great. I mean...
- Yeah.

226
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:56,094
- We're ready.
- Okay. Well...

227
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:59,965
- It's great to see you again.
- Good to see you.

228
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:02,036
Okay, bye.

229
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,241
Were you distracted
by his good-conduct medal?

230
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,818
Shut up, Max.

231
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:16,919
Helen White.

232
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:28,694
"16,137 results."

233
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:32,970
This Internet is so darn easy.

234
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:53,615
Oh, God. He's married.

235
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:02,556
So how'd it go with Claudia?
She's quite a catch, huh?

236
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:05,330
Yeah. It's amazing you ever let her go.

237
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:08,503
She mentioned she's my ex-wife,
did she?

238
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:10,199
Yeah, it came up.

239
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:11,773
What, did you ask for references?

240
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:14,573
You know, just 'cause she hates me
is no reason you two couldn't work out.

241
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,443
You know who I ran into
at the restaurant?

242
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:18,209
- Uh-uh.
- Helen White.

243
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:20,917
Ring a bell? Ding-ding?

244
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:25,212
Helen White? Wait a minute.

245
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:28,517
The Helen White?
The one you were gonna marry?

246
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:30,928
Well, it's either fate or trouble.

247
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,897
She looked great,
but I think she's married.

248
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:36,593
She was with some guy,
and she had a ring.

249
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:39,170
Okay, that's trouble.
Come on, Frank, what are you thinking?

250
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:43,674
I don't know.
I was up all night. I was Googling her.

251
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:47,143
Jeez, Frank,
you Googled another man's wife?

252
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:49,813
Yeah. What do you think that means?

253
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:52,110
I don't know. Something dirty.

254
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:53,908
Well, it's not.

255
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:58,182
I just wish there was a place
I could run into her again.

256
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:37,253
Remember the senior-class picnic
down by the river?

257
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:38,990
- The thunderstorm?
- Yeah.

258
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:42,932
Everybody screaming.
Then we crawled under the rowboat.

259
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:44,297
Oh, yeah.

260
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:47,538
And then, even when it stopped raining,
we didn't come out.

261
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:48,697
Yeah.

262
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,908
Anyway, that Max...

263
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,379
he's a lucky guy.

264
00:16:56,949 --> 00:17:00,407
Max? You think I'm with Max? No.

265
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,919
But you're wearing a wedding ring.

266
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:06,084
Yeah, no, I am. I just never took it off.

267
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,352
My husband passed away
about four years ago.

268
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,484
Car accident.

269
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:12,962
Oh, I'm sorry. I understand. I...

270
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,834
I lost my wife a few years ago.

271
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,931
Oh, Frank, I'm sorry.

272
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,437
Flashback!

273
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,034
Frank and Helen holding hands.

274
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:26,868
- So cute.
- You wanna dance?

275
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,829
So, how many kids do you have?

276
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,771
How many kids do you have?

277
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:57,572
You first.

278
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:05,110
Okay, look,
you're gonna find out eventually...

279
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:08,277
because there's too many
to hide in the closet.

280
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,114
I have eight kids.

281
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:19,523
I have 10.

282
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:24,301
- You have 10?
- I have 10.

283
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,095
- You don't.
- I do. I have 10.

284
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:30,300
- Did you say 10?
- Yeah.

285
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:36,948
I had four and we adopted six.

286
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,340
I mean, that wasn't the plan.

287
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:42,477
We were foster parents,
and we just fell in love with all of them,

288
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:44,556
so we adopted.

289
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:48,220
- Probably seems crazy.
- You don't have to explain to me.

290
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:51,854
I mean, I never thought
that I'd love being a dad this much.

291
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:55,598
My wife, she was the one
who wanted the big family.

292
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:59,569
But now it just seems
like the most natural thing in the world.

293
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,280
Is this really happening?

294
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:12,280
I hope so.

295
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:28,796
So then I asked her to marry me.

296
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,164
- And I said yes.
- What?

297
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:37,532
It was spontaneous and so romantic.

298
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:40,976
- How could you do this?
- We don't even know this guy!

299
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:43,405
You got married?

300
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:46,407
- Without telling us?
- Yeah. Yeah.

301
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:50,318
Sir, at least when you were reassigned
to Guam, there was an e-mail.

302
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:52,921
Does he know you have 10 kids?

303
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:56,091
- Who wants the talking stick first?
- May I have it, please?

304
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,389
Yes, Jimi.

305
00:19:57,496 --> 00:20:00,761
- Are you crazy?
- Yeah, Mom.

306
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,031
We don't even know him, Mom!

307
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:06,366
Okay. Quiet. I have the talking stick.

308
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:08,966
He's a lovely, lovely man.

309
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:12,566
And I'm sorry that we didn't include you.
And he has...

310
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:15,810
Ten kids?

311
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,073
Hey, guys.

312
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:19,810
No. There's no way. Let's make this...

313
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:21,317
Guys!

314
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:24,344
It'll be fun...

315
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,284
having 10 new brothers and sisters.

316
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,993
Okay, come on, guys. Come on,
come on, group hug. Come on.

317
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:33,792
- Come on.
- Okay.

318
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,594
It's gonna be fun.

319
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,794
But where will we live?

320
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,637
Hey, Mick, come down here.

321
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,572
Come on, Fiona.

322
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,997
Okay. Head count. We've got...

323
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:12,430
5, 10...

324
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:17,107
15, 16, 17, 18...

325
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:20,070
plus the pig.
All present and accounted for.

326
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:28,185
Before you make your break
for the bedroom...

327
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,687
could you point me to my billet?

328
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,724
Behind the kitchen, Mrs. Munion.
How do you like the place?

329
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:36,555
- It has a certain...
- Charm.

330
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:38,356
...smell.

331
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:42,729
Like paprika with a hint of wet dog.

332
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:46,028
We're really glad you like the place.

333
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:49,166
Okay. Okay.

334
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:53,341
- Crew!
- Kids!

335
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:57,512
All right, then. All right, kids.
Fall in for billeting!

336
00:21:57,616 --> 00:22:00,380
- For what?
- Room assignments.

337
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,419
All eyes on the chart.

338
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:05,116
Your rooms are numbered.

339
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:09,292
Your bathroom schedules
are color-coded.

340
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:13,023
- You've gotta be kidding.
- Yeah, right.

341
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,265
That's a good thing. It's great...

342
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:22,397
because we all need
a little bit of organization.

343
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:25,101
We do, honey. You did a beautiful job.

344
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:28,072
Great.
Mom gets married, we get drafted.

345
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:35,809
Get back, Fiona. Get back here. Fiona.

346
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:40,853
Hey, what's that badge for?

347
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,952
It's pretty cool.

348
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:45,859
- Animal skinning.
- Mom!

349
00:22:57,642 --> 00:22:59,872
- Done!
- You have an illness.

350
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:05,780
- Hey! What are you doing?
- It's called decorating.

351
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:08,580
- No, that's called vandalism.
- Whatever.

352
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,682
Okay.

353
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:19,054
- No way.
- No way.

354
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,131
Come back, Fiona! Come back!

355
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,092
Spit it. Spit it out!

356
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:25,669
- Come on, spit it out.
- What is going on?

357
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:27,636
Come on, give it to me.

358
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:29,564
Where's my cell phone?

359
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:34,311
You are so dead.

360
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,937
She's just a pig.

361
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:37,639
Not the pig. You.

362
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:42,781
Mom, the cheerleader's after me!
Run, Fiona!

363
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:46,780
Kids!

364
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,119
Admiral!

365
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:49,784
Sounds like they're bonding.

366
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:51,829
That doesn't sound like bonding to me,
Frank.

367
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,660
- They just need a little jump-start.
- Jump-start?

368
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,963
Yeah.
Look, grab about a quart of sun block.

369
00:23:58,136 --> 00:24:00,036
I have a plan.

370
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:01,831
Okay.

371
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:17,083
<i>So, everyone,
what do you think of the My Way?</i>

372
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:19,282
Who's gonna sail this thing?

373
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:21,791
We, the Beardsley family, sail it...

374
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:25,886
while you guys, I'm guessing, hang out
in the cabin and pick your noses.

375
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:28,431
No, we are all going to sail it...

376
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:31,625
working together like
the many tentacles of an octopus...

377
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:33,567
guided by one brain.

378
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:35,933
My children have separate brains,
Frank.

379
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,531
It's just a figure of speech.

380
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:40,509
- No, it isn't.
- Hey, trust me.

381
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:44,343
One hour at sea together,
gonna be best friends.

382
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:47,081
Okay, prepare to come about!

383
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:50,614
- Coming about!
- Come a what?

384
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:51,984
Look out!

385
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:57,351
Wasn't anybody listening...

386
00:24:57,462 --> 00:25:00,795
when I gave my briefing
about standard nautical procedure?

387
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:02,366
I have sunscreen in my eye, sweetie.

388
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:05,163
Oh, well, let's go below.
We'll wash it out.

389
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,204
- William, take the wheel.
- Aye, aye, sir.

390
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:10,604
- Mrs. Munion, you have the kids.
- No problem.

391
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,902
<i>Get that camera away from me.</i>

392
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,173
<i>But I'm capturing
the vérité of life at sea.</i>

393
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:18,647
<i>How about capturing my fist
in your face?</i>

394
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:20,184
Hey!

395
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:24,120
Look, Otter peed in his pants.

396
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:26,583
No, I didn't. That's just water.

397
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,283
It doesn't smell like water.

398
00:25:28,393 --> 00:25:30,327
I'm gonna go tell our dad.

399
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:33,090
- I'm gonna tell my mom.
- I'm gonna tell my mom.

400
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:35,433
I don't feel so good.

401
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:39,435
Just keep your eye on the horizon.
I'll get you some ginger ale.

402
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:42,098
- Kelly, get ready to feed the sail.
- Aye, aye.

403
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,735
What are you doing? Come on, watch it.

404
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:51,779
Raise the jib!

405
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:59,889
Hey! Get me down! Get me down!

406
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:03,926
Okay, get me down from here,
you freaks!

407
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:09,364
- Such a loser.
- Oh, yeah?

408
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:11,662
Let's see how funny you think this is
from the water.

409
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:12,964
- He's gonna kill me.
- Stop it!

410
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,629
You better run for it.

411
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,333
Oh, gross!

412
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:20,172
- What's going on?
- Coming about!

413
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,643
William! Come about!

414
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:30,480
- William!
- What's going on?

415
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:33,486
I'm fine, sweetie.

416
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:37,792
Is this standard nautical procedure?

417
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:40,053
No.

418
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:21,463
Oops, missed a little spot right there.

419
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:24,402
What's the matter?

420
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:29,246
I'm just giving up on my dream
of having an all-family sailing team.

421
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:32,811
Well, look on the bright side.

422
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:35,442
You got to spend the day
at sea with me.

423
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:38,021
Yeah. Yeah, that was okay.

424
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:41,058
That was okay? That was okay?

425
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,059
- I'll show you okay.
- Oh, yeah?

426
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:46,323
We can hear that.

427
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:48,896
No, you can't.

428
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,696
Maybe if we're really, really quiet. Okay?

429
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:52,792
A little quieter.

430
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:56,897
No, I like hearing their voices.
It helps me sleep.

431
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:59,408
Well, I like quiet. Now shut up.

432
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:02,810
- Why don't you shut up, loser?
- "Shut up" is a bad word.

433
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:06,077
Maybe if we're really, really, really...

434
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,879
Quiet. Yeah.

435
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:10,011
This family is nuts.

436
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,287
Maybe if we had a door that worked.

437
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:20,830
Yeah. Tomorrow.

438
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:39,949
Mom!

439
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:42,916
Make her stop!

440
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:44,212
That noise!

441
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:47,485
Hey, reveille! Reveille! It's 6:05!

442
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:50,755
Time to get up!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

443
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:52,625
Move it, move it, move it!

444
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,596
Oh, my God. Who's killing a goat?

445
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:58,829
All right. These are your schedules
with latrine times.

446
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:01,963
You get seven minutes each.
Do not waste it.

447
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:04,837
Why do I suddenly feel
like I'm in prison?

448
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:06,806
Fashion police caught up with you?

449
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:09,505
Snap! Up top, girlfriend!

450
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:13,677
- Why the drill, Admiral?
- It's not a drill, William.

451
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:16,686
We have doubled our force.
That calls for increased coordination.

452
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:19,552
Don't worry,
you'll soon be doing this in your sleep.

453
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:21,090
I am asleep.

454
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:25,122
- Can someone pass the hash browns?
- Hey, guys, give me that cereal.

455
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:29,223
Kelly, can you
please give me a pancake?

456
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:31,200
I don't want any.

457
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:33,264
Bacon, please.

458
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:35,367
Thank you.

459
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:36,804
Wait, I want that.

460
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:40,400
- Butter. I love butter.
- Come on.

461
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,438
Give me the syrup, please.

462
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,447
Does somebody want
to eat my oatmeal?

463
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:57,084
I'm sorry, William.
Is that your homework?

464
00:29:57,195 --> 00:29:58,492
Listen up!

465
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:02,558
Before you go to school,
there's one thing we need to do.

466
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:07,130
- Everybody ready?
- Yeah.

467
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:09,539
- Hi, you've reached Frank.
- Helen.

468
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:10,630
- Harry.
- Bina.

469
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:11,709
- Naoko.
- Michael.

470
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:12,777
- Aldo.
- Joni.

471
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:13,866
- Phoebe.
- William.

472
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:14,967
- Otter.
- Ely.

473
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:16,046
- Christina.
- Ethan.

474
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:17,239
- Mick.
- Oh!

475
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:41,899
Hey, are you the freaks?

476
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:45,669
I heard you have, like,
25 brothers and sisters.

477
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:47,745
No, we just have 16.

478
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:51,145
- Nasty.
- Dude, I hear they all sleep in drawers!

479
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:54,878
And they're so poor, they all
have to share one pair of underpants!

480
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:58,420
<i>Eighteen kids!
Man, that's like The Brady Bunch!</i>

481
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,115
Times three. Wait!

482
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:02,750
<i>Party of Five times three,
plus My Three Sons.</i>

483
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:06,923
What? I like math.

484
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,357
Yeah. Won't we, like... Oh, my...

485
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:10,593
- Hey.
- Hi.

486
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,296
<i>And all the pieces fit</i>

487
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:15,904
<i>And everything was bright</i>

488
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:20,311
Unbelievable. Not only do I
have to listen to it at home...

489
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:22,140
but I'm forced to catch the road show.

490
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:24,875
Well, not all music
needs back-up dancers.

491
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:26,450
Just the good music.

492
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:29,042
- Hey.
- Hey!

493
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,185
Forget about it.

494
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:36,317
What are you talking about?

495
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:40,295
Look, I've known Nick for years.
He's cute, but totally shallow.

496
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,965
Then again, maybe he is your type.

497
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:47,597
Where's the Admiral?

498
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:50,902
I'm lodging a formal complaint
against Phoebe. She stinks!

499
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:54,334
He's probably out
dreaming up new ways to ruin our lives.

500
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:55,742
This is so ridiculous!

501
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:58,907
Just because he got married,
we all have to suffer.

502
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:00,416
Not necessarily.

503
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:02,179
Okay, what are you doing
on Dad's computer?

504
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:04,619
Just making a few changes
to the schedule.

505
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:06,383
Unauthorized, of course.

506
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:11,424
Now this I can live with.

507
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:15,989
Come on! I have to get ready for school.

508
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,091
Your face isn't big enough
to hold that much makeup.

509
00:32:18,202 --> 00:32:20,534
Get a watch, hippie chick. It's my time.

510
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:22,263
She's right. Our time was first.

511
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:24,238
No way.
I checked the schedule last night.

512
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:26,037
Those evil preppies
must have changed it.

513
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:28,374
- We should pound them!
- Yeah.

514
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:29,446
Kick their butts.

515
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:33,348
To me, nothing says
"time to get out of the bathroom" like...

516
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:37,553
Fire!

517
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:41,622
Hey, what's going on?
Watch your backs.

518
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:44,217
- Where's the fire?
- Be quick. Go downstairs!

519
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:46,422
Outside, outside.
On the grass. On the grass.

520
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,429
Everyone, let's go!

521
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:55,506
Okay, out the door, out the door.

522
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:57,741
Go! Get out, get out, get out!

523
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:03,470
- Victory to the North kids!
- Yeah.

524
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:06,240
Guys, guys!
Come on, let's go watch them!

525
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:17,653
- Nice towel, Christina.
- Yeah, cute boxers, William.

526
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:21,129
- You guys are so dead.
- At least we'll be clean.

527
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:23,427
Can I get the two of you guys
closer together?

528
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:26,594
- Naoko, what are you doing?
- Webcasting.

529
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:29,737
Say cheese.

530
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:31,272
Come on, guys.

531
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,236
This is our talking stick.

532
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,706
And this is a "no judgment circle."

533
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,477
So whoever has the stick...

534
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:44,043
may express themselves
without fear or interruption.

535
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:46,749
So, William, why don't you begin?

536
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:49,918
Go ahead.
Just, you know, say what you need to.

537
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:06,172
Wait.
One of you must have something to say.

538
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,976
Okay, if I can interrupt...

539
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:12,072
I'll take the talking stick.

540
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:15,142
Okay, I have something to say.

541
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:20,015
In the interest
of making this house a home...

542
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:24,623
I have come up with a little chore chart.

543
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,760
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Is this a joke?

544
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:30,129
Charts are never a joke
with the Admiral.

545
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,065
Look, Mom, we gotta go.
We're gonna be late.

546
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,660
- Let's go.
- Yeah, let's get out of here.

547
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:35,170
Whoa! Whoa!

548
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:37,935
I want you all home right after school...

549
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:42,069
because we have to go out
and requisition supplies.

550
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,271
- Dismissed.
- Let's go.

551
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:51,751
That's a nice chart, Frank.

552
00:34:51,956 --> 00:34:54,857
Looks like you put a lot of work into it.

553
00:34:54,959 --> 00:34:57,655
And this is definitely one of a kind.

554
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:00,521
Give me that.

555
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:04,800
That was a disaster.

556
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:08,670
Well, at least there's no blood. Yet.

557
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:22,142
- What are you doing?
- Hey, Christina.

558
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:24,651
You lied to me.
You said he was a loser.

559
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:26,746
- He is a loser.
- Hey!

560
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,559
- A very hot loser.
- Cool.

561
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,823
Thanks for the warning, Sis.

562
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:35,126
I'll be sure to return the favor,
first chance I get.

563
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:38,933
She seems sweet.

564
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:46,034
Hey, Admiral,
will you build me and Aldo a sandbox?

565
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:49,272
Well, sure, once we get further along
with the house.

566
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,007
Yay, a sandbox!

567
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:55,046
Okay, blue team, Spackle.

568
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,678
Red team, insulation.

569
00:35:58,356 --> 00:36:01,052
- You guys, stop that!
- I didn't hit you.

570
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:02,889
- Hey.
- Give it back.

571
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,462
You want the ball? Go get it.

572
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:07,587
- Where'd it go?
- Let's go get it!

573
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,399
Hey, buddy, would you give me a hand?

574
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:17,230
- It's mine.
- No, it's mine.

575
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:18,808
- It's mine.
- Mine.

576
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:21,242
- Mine.
- I want it! It's my ball!

577
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,539
Give it back.

578
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:26,375
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, Dad.

579
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:28,349
- How do you stop this thing?
- Otter?

580
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:29,714
I don't know!

581
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,787
Otter!

582
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:33,652
- Turn the wheel!
- Ely! Hey!

583
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:35,324
Whoa, stop!

584
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,652
Stop! Hey, hit the brake! Hit the brake!

585
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:41,563
What, this one? Where is the brake?

586
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:43,998
I don't know.
Pull that lever! I can't reach it! Pull it!

587
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:45,591
- The other lever!
- It's this one!

588
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,261
The other one. The other lever!

589
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:50,767
It's the other lever.

590
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,843
- No, it's this one.
- Oh, no!

591
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:55,435
Otter! Pull the lever! Pull the lever!

592
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,810
The other one! The other lever!

593
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:00,643
Pull the...

594
00:37:03,754 --> 00:37:05,688
- What will we do?
- Get off it!

595
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,348
Otter, Ely!

596
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:10,688
- Admiral, you okay?
- Where are the boys?

597
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:12,422
- Where are the boys?
- What?

598
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,225
- Where are the boys?
- I don't know.

599
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:15,299
Otter!

600
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:19,258
Stop! Stop!

601
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:30,713
Yay, a sandbox!

602
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:53,667
- How's it going?
- Good.

603
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:57,201
I ordered us a part that'll have us
up and running in no time.

604
00:37:57,308 --> 00:38:01,244
You sure are putting a lot of effort
into fixing that big old light bulb.

605
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:05,003
A lighthouse without a light
is just a house.

606
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:07,244
And that's a problem because...

607
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:11,014
Have I ever told you the story
of the beautiful lighthouse keeper?

608
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:14,819
The beautiful lighthouse keeper? No.
I think I would have remembered that.

609
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:19,259
Well, once upon a time,
there was a beautiful lighthouse keeper.

610
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:21,627
Wait, wait.
I thought that lighthouse keepers...

611
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:24,200
were old men in yellow raincoats
with long white beards.

612
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:27,760
Oh, no. This one was a real hottie.

613
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:32,138
- She had long red hair. She was tall...
- Yeah.

614
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:35,940
...and her body, it was the bomb.

615
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:40,048
Anyway, her man was a sailor.

616
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,618
Oh, I love sailors.

617
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:45,246
And he was afraid that she'd find
someone else whenever he was away.

618
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:47,790
- No.
- So she said to him...

619
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:51,287
"As long as that light up there is lit...

620
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:53,989
"my heart will always be yours."

621
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:58,996
So, from then on,
whenever he was away at sea...

622
00:38:59,303 --> 00:39:03,103
he could just look back
and he'd see that light...

623
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:07,905
and he knew
that his true love still cared.

624
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:17,185
- Frank?
- Yes, my beautiful lighthouse keeper.

625
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:19,720
We're doing the right thing, aren't we?

626
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:22,292
- We've had a bumpy start.
- Yeah.

627
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:23,985
Come here,
I wanna show you something.

628
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:25,426
- Okay.
- Look.

629
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:26,654
Okay.

630
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:37,168
See that? That's the buddy system.

631
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:41,108
We're jelling as a family,
even as we speak.

632
00:39:42,613 --> 00:39:45,275
Yeah. You know, it just might work.

633
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:09,402
- You have to turn it over.
- I know, Lau.

634
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:12,608
- Thicker, Kelly, thicker.
- I know.

635
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,814
Otter and Ely, playing outside.

636
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:25,683
Ethan, Aldo, playing inside.

637
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:27,389
Marisa and Bina...

638
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:30,016
- Can we plant flowers?
- A garden?

639
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:33,088
I think planting a garden
would be lovely.

640
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:36,563
- Yay, a garden!
- Flowers are going to be fun.

641
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:38,635
So that leaves time for a little drive.

642
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:41,864
I have this romantic spot
I've been wanting to take you to.

643
00:40:41,972 --> 00:40:43,530
I'll get my keys.

644
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:46,576
Mrs. Munion, would you mind
watching the little kids for a while?

645
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:49,612
Oh, sure. They'll be in full lockdown.

646
00:40:49,713 --> 00:40:52,341
- Good.
- Well, lockdown won't be necessary.

647
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,816
Just check in on them
every now and then.

648
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:58,082
We'll be back. Mrs. Munion's in charge.

649
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:14,868
Finally, a moment alone.

650
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:18,872
Excuse me.

651
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:23,146
Sorry. We're with quality control.

652
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:27,340
- Products testing.
- I'm sorry. Oh, my God!

653
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:29,715
- Just leave it. Come on.
- I'm so sorry.

654
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:32,814
- I'm really, really sorry.
- Let's try that one.

655
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:35,721
- Oh, my gosh.
- Better yet, let's go look at sofas.

656
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:41,821
Why do I have to do all this work
just to live with these jerks?

657
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:43,957
Well, what do you suggest?

658
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:48,030
What, are you gonna
drop a stink bomb on them?

659
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:49,969
Just watch the master.

660
00:41:54,578 --> 00:41:56,671
- Hey!
- Watch it, jerk.

661
00:41:57,581 --> 00:41:58,707
Loser!

662
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,711
- Goofer.
- Hey, get back here.

663
00:42:03,053 --> 00:42:06,816
- You did not just splatter me with paint.
- What are you talking about?

664
00:42:07,992 --> 00:42:09,152
Is that my shirt?

665
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:12,024
The one that you just got paint on?
Yeah, thank God.

666
00:42:12,129 --> 00:42:13,926
- Take it off.
- Hey!

667
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,000
- How dare you?
- Don't...

668
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:20,430
- Stop it.
...wear my clothes.

669
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:25,774
- Hey, it's not a construction pit.
- You're not the boss of us.

670
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:26,877
Oh, yeah?

671
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:31,070
- Get them! Get them!
- Take this.

672
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:40,179
- Hey, that's my Rescue Hero.
- I want it.

673
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:42,122
- Give it back.
- Ow!

674
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:46,293
Loser! Hit him with the chair!

675
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:47,762
What's that noise?

676
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:00,677
Losers!

677
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:03,011
My wallpaper!

678
00:43:06,517 --> 00:43:09,611
- Hey, what's going on?
- Now you guys are all in trouble.

679
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:12,682
You're going down, Jimi!

680
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:36,744
Stop! Stop! Hey, guys!

681
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:39,379
Stop! Hey!

682
00:43:39,483 --> 00:43:40,950
Hey, stop!

683
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:42,274
Guys!

684
00:43:48,325 --> 00:43:49,690
Whoa! Stop!

685
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:11,145
You wrecked the house,
you trashed the yard...

686
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:13,578
and you painted the pig.

687
00:44:14,852 --> 00:44:19,482
You turned a 200-year-old panel foyer
into a Jackson...

688
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:21,588
- Pollock.
- Pollock!

689
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:24,923
- It was her fault for wearing my shirt...
- I am not finished!

690
00:44:25,295 --> 00:44:28,787
Now, your mother and I know
that you do not get along.

691
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:30,992
But you're just going
to have to pretend...

692
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:34,127
that you like each other
until you actually do.

693
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:38,735
And until you have learned
why we think that you are all...

694
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:41,268
Till you...

695
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:45,378
Until you've learned
why we think you're all so terrific...

696
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:49,613
we demand a level of civility
and cooperation...

697
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:53,850
or I will bring the hammer down.

698
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:58,419
- Is it a real hammer?
- No, no. That's just a metaphor.

699
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:01,259
- I'm scared.
- Don't be scared, Aldo. Don't be scared.

700
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:04,061
- I am.
- Should I go get the hammer, sir?

701
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:07,069
It's not a real hammer.
It's just a pretend hammer.

702
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:08,763
I only said that for effect.

703
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:11,363
Now, we'd like you
to all think about what we just said.

704
00:45:11,475 --> 00:45:13,409
Except for maybe
the part about the hammer.

705
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:16,479
Yeah, forget the hammer. Let's just...

706
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:18,844
Let's just get started
cleaning this place up.

707
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:21,713
But first, let's have a group hug.

708
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:23,383
- Come on.
- Okay.

709
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:24,954
- Good, good.
- You mean...

710
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:28,388
- actually hug each other?
- Yeah, that's what I mean. Come on.

711
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:29,652
Frank.

712
00:45:32,863 --> 00:45:34,694
Yeah. Well...

713
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:38,993
Gang, let's get in
on this group-hug thing.

714
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:42,231
Come on, let's...
That's an order. Come on.

715
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:43,972
There you go.

716
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:47,006
Can't you feel the love, honey?

717
00:45:57,353 --> 00:46:01,153
Okay, everybody.
It's time that we call a truce.

718
00:46:01,257 --> 00:46:03,691
- No way.
- Over my dead body.

719
00:46:03,793 --> 00:46:07,092
We need to unite
against a greater enemy.

720
00:46:07,363 --> 00:46:10,491
And that enemy's name
is Mom and Dad.

721
00:46:11,901 --> 00:46:13,334
What are you talking about?

722
00:46:13,436 --> 00:46:15,495
He's saying
we are all totally incompatible...

723
00:46:15,605 --> 00:46:17,072
but our parents don't seem to care.

724
00:46:17,173 --> 00:46:19,539
Exactly. Guys, we're all in this together.

725
00:46:19,642 --> 00:46:21,200
Some of us are in it together...

726
00:46:21,311 --> 00:46:24,678
and some of us are busy
cornering the boyfriend market.

727
00:46:24,781 --> 00:46:27,375
You stole my shirt.
Now we're even, cheerleader.

728
00:46:27,483 --> 00:46:30,145
Come on, guys,
none of us likes this situation.

729
00:46:30,253 --> 00:46:33,950
But if we want out, then we gotta
stop fighting and get them to start.

730
00:46:34,057 --> 00:46:35,786
- Really?
- How are we gonna do that?

731
00:46:35,892 --> 00:46:40,420
Easy. Who knows what drives
our parents crazy better than we do?

732
00:47:04,787 --> 00:47:06,015
Helen!

733
00:47:19,001 --> 00:47:22,095
- Hey, I wanna do it!
- I wanna do it!

734
00:47:23,005 --> 00:47:25,132
<i>Washington,
this is soldiers' morning update.</i>

735
00:47:25,241 --> 00:47:26,572
<i>This morning...</i>

736
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:34,180
<i>Sports talk 640
and the Patriots are going for a three.</i>

737
00:47:50,466 --> 00:47:51,899
Oh, no, no.

738
00:47:52,201 --> 00:47:54,431
Guys, where are the baby greens?

739
00:47:54,537 --> 00:47:56,300
It looks like Frank did some shopping.

740
00:47:56,406 --> 00:47:58,670
What is that smell? My God.

741
00:47:59,742 --> 00:48:02,074
- That's barbaric.
- Is that a liver?

742
00:48:08,651 --> 00:48:10,778
Well, shall we get some tea?

743
00:48:10,887 --> 00:48:12,787
That would be lovely.

744
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:15,221
I love tea in the afternoon.

745
00:48:15,324 --> 00:48:17,815
I love tea, but we have to boil it.

746
00:48:19,228 --> 00:48:20,820
Helen!

747
00:48:21,063 --> 00:48:22,496
Atten-hut!

748
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,132
Right shoulder arms!

749
00:48:28,104 --> 00:48:30,163
Right face!

750
00:48:32,041 --> 00:48:34,305
Forward arms!

751
00:48:35,111 --> 00:48:37,671
- Ready!
- Looking good, men.

752
00:48:38,514 --> 00:48:40,038
- Don't they?
- Ready!

753
00:48:40,149 --> 00:48:44,483
- Fire! Ready! Fire!
- Frank.

754
00:48:44,587 --> 00:48:46,680
- Fix bayonets!
- Frank!

755
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:51,323
- What if he brings his hammer?
- There is no hammer.

756
00:48:51,527 --> 00:48:53,757
But maybe
we're kind of crossing the line.

757
00:48:53,863 --> 00:48:56,093
And I don't feel right
about endangering the little kids.

758
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:59,726
Trust me, they're biologically protected
by the cuteness factor.

759
00:49:00,937 --> 00:49:02,461
This is gonna be good.

760
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:06,175
You like it?

761
00:49:06,275 --> 00:49:08,470
- Stop!
- Isn't it pretty?

762
00:49:08,845 --> 00:49:11,973
That was very naughty.

763
00:49:12,114 --> 00:49:13,809
What's happening?

764
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:18,145
Boys, I don't think that was a good idea,
do you?

765
00:49:18,488 --> 00:49:19,648
- No.
- No.

766
00:49:19,755 --> 00:49:21,655
But that was very important
to your father...

767
00:49:21,757 --> 00:49:23,315
so you need to say you're sorry.

768
00:49:23,426 --> 00:49:24,586
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

769
00:49:24,694 --> 00:49:26,889
Okay, now go on and play.

770
00:49:27,063 --> 00:49:31,056
Whoa, whoa! That's it? "Go play"?

771
00:49:31,167 --> 00:49:34,694
Well, they're four years old, Frank.
What else is there? The hammer?

772
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:37,172
- There are other...
- A spanking?

773
00:49:37,273 --> 00:49:40,868
No, honey, of course not.
We don't spank our children.

774
00:49:40,977 --> 00:49:42,604
The Admiral does.

775
00:49:46,649 --> 00:49:50,312
Occasionally, a little pat on the butt
sends a clear message.

776
00:49:50,419 --> 00:49:53,820
- Well, you're not spanking my children.
- I thought they were our children.

777
00:49:53,923 --> 00:49:56,255
You're not spanking our children.

778
00:49:57,159 --> 00:49:58,990
Okay, fine.

779
00:49:59,095 --> 00:50:01,893
Let's just let them all run naked
and wild.

780
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:04,364
- Yay!
- Yay!

781
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:16,706
Do you think it's working?

782
00:50:17,847 --> 00:50:21,078
- Does that answer your question?
- Yes!

783
00:50:30,226 --> 00:50:33,286
The committee was very impressed,
Frank. Nice job.

784
00:50:33,396 --> 00:50:35,660
I take my work very seriously, sir.

785
00:50:35,831 --> 00:50:38,493
And don't think
that the brass hasn't noticed.

786
00:50:38,668 --> 00:50:42,331
- The brass, sir?
- I'm the brass, and I've noticed.

787
00:50:42,505 --> 00:50:44,905
I just don't like
giving direct compliments.

788
00:50:45,007 --> 00:50:47,032
Something about it feels unmanly.

789
00:50:47,143 --> 00:50:49,873
- Well, thank you.
- Oh, what the hell.

790
00:50:50,112 --> 00:50:53,411
Goldarn, I'm proud of you, Frank.

791
00:50:53,649 --> 00:50:56,243
You deserve everything
you're about to get.

792
00:51:00,189 --> 00:51:01,588
<i>- Helen?
- Yeah.</i>

793
00:51:01,691 --> 00:51:02,885
We got Saks.

794
00:51:04,126 --> 00:51:05,093
What?

795
00:51:05,227 --> 00:51:08,060
<i>- We got Saks.
- Oh, Max!</i>

796
00:51:08,397 --> 00:51:10,888
I got Saks! I got Saks.

797
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,436
Thank you! I can't believe it, Max!

798
00:51:14,537 --> 00:51:15,799
Yeah, but don't get too excited.

799
00:51:15,905 --> 00:51:18,135
They wanna see a dozen new designs
by Friday.

800
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,935
By Friday?

801
00:51:20,142 --> 00:51:22,872
Oh, I'm excited and scared,
all at the same time.

802
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:25,479
No, you can do it.
At least now you got Frank to lean on.

803
00:51:25,581 --> 00:51:27,640
Yeah, yeah. I guess.

804
00:51:27,917 --> 00:51:29,908
Well, I better get going.
I got a lot to do.

805
00:51:38,961 --> 00:51:40,656
Do you like these better?

806
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:44,928
- Okay. Well, then I think you're set.
- Thank you.

807
00:51:45,034 --> 00:51:46,262
Love you.

808
00:51:49,205 --> 00:51:52,766
- Sorry about the chalkboard, Admiral.
- It's all right, sailor.

809
00:51:53,809 --> 00:51:54,867
Hey.

810
00:51:59,982 --> 00:52:02,644
Why don't you
just kiss her and make up?

811
00:52:06,489 --> 00:52:08,218
Mrs. Munion isn't so bad.

812
00:52:08,324 --> 00:52:10,019
You're not getting any younger.

813
00:52:10,126 --> 00:52:13,721
- Can we please have some privacy?
- All right. I'm off.

814
00:52:15,631 --> 00:52:18,099
- I'm sorry about what happened.
- Me, too.

815
00:52:20,970 --> 00:52:22,801
So, how'd your meeting go?

816
00:52:22,905 --> 00:52:25,465
Did he mention anything
about the promotion?

817
00:52:26,275 --> 00:52:28,368
No, not really. It's...

818
00:52:28,477 --> 00:52:30,502
That's just a pipe dream, anyway.

819
00:52:30,613 --> 00:52:33,582
- Is it?
- You're not getting rid of me that easily.

820
00:52:33,983 --> 00:52:35,575
- How was your day?
- Oh, my day.

821
00:52:35,685 --> 00:52:37,277
Well, let's see.

822
00:52:37,386 --> 00:52:40,048
I ate and I worked a little bit...

823
00:52:40,156 --> 00:52:42,954
and I made a giant deal
with Saks Fifth Avenue.

824
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:44,651
- You did not!
- I did, too.

825
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:47,752
That's great news. Oh, that's fantastic.

826
00:52:47,997 --> 00:52:51,592
- I'm so proud of you.
- I couldn't wait to tell you.

827
00:52:52,401 --> 00:52:54,699
Great. Well, how could I help you?

828
00:52:55,037 --> 00:52:57,699
- What can I do around here to help you?
- I'm set.

829
00:52:57,807 --> 00:53:01,903
- You need help organizing the studio?
- No, no. The studio is organized.

830
00:53:02,912 --> 00:53:06,473
Of course it is, yeah.
Well, I'll think of something.

831
00:53:09,452 --> 00:53:12,649
Guys, guys! Listen up!

832
00:53:13,022 --> 00:53:16,185
Your mom is going to be very busy
over the next couple of days...

833
00:53:16,292 --> 00:53:19,261
so I want everyone
on their best behavior.

834
00:53:19,395 --> 00:53:22,592
- That's an order.
- We're always on our best behavior, sir.

835
00:53:25,167 --> 00:53:26,896
- Ethan!
- Get away...

836
00:53:27,002 --> 00:53:29,368
- from Mrs. Munion.
- Aldo! Excuse us! Boys!

837
00:53:29,472 --> 00:53:31,770
I guess we'll be doing
a little extra cleaning, too.

838
00:53:31,874 --> 00:53:33,000
- Ethan, this way.
- Come back.

839
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:34,804
Right. As you were.

840
00:53:35,077 --> 00:53:36,203
This way!

841
00:53:36,579 --> 00:53:37,841
Cleaning, huh?

842
00:53:37,947 --> 00:53:40,677
Grab the other guys.
I know just where to start.

843
00:53:41,917 --> 00:53:44,852
Bright colors. Permanent press.

844
00:53:45,755 --> 00:53:47,120
Whites.

845
00:53:47,757 --> 00:53:48,724
Excuse me.

846
00:53:48,824 --> 00:53:50,849
- It's still wet.
- Socks.

847
00:53:52,528 --> 00:53:55,224
Michael, is there something you forgot?

848
00:53:55,798 --> 00:53:57,026
Shut up.

849
00:53:57,666 --> 00:53:59,361
That's mine.

850
00:54:02,872 --> 00:54:05,272
Oh, my gosh. That was so sick.

851
00:54:05,374 --> 00:54:06,864
- Did you do it?
- Yeah.

852
00:54:20,389 --> 00:54:21,583
Kids!

853
00:54:21,724 --> 00:54:25,353
I just don't understand.
Where are my velvet, blue buttons?

854
00:54:26,595 --> 00:54:29,758
You know what?
Why would anybody do this?

855
00:54:29,932 --> 00:54:33,060
- But it's clean.
- No, honey, I can't work with clean.

856
00:54:33,169 --> 00:54:36,900
I have a deadline. Oh, my God,
I'll never be able to find anything.

857
00:54:37,006 --> 00:54:39,406
My Ultrasuede used to be here,
right beneath the blue fur.

858
00:54:39,508 --> 00:54:41,066
Do you remember that?

859
00:54:41,544 --> 00:54:45,207
- Where's my fake alligator skin?
- We thought we'd surprise you.

860
00:54:45,314 --> 00:54:47,475
Yeah, we thought that you'd like it.

861
00:54:47,583 --> 00:54:51,178
The Admiral always does say,
"A clean ship is a happy ship."

862
00:54:51,854 --> 00:54:54,448
Hey. Wow!

863
00:54:55,791 --> 00:54:58,123
This place is shipshape.

864
00:54:58,661 --> 00:55:01,129
Well, you just had to, Frank, didn't you?

865
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:02,959
- Excuse me?
- You know, Frank...

866
00:55:03,065 --> 00:55:06,432
I understand your pathological need
to organize the rest of the house...

867
00:55:06,535 --> 00:55:08,264
but this is my space.

868
00:55:08,437 --> 00:55:11,964
I need just a little bit of respect.
You're killing me, Frank.

869
00:55:14,276 --> 00:55:15,800
Did I miss something?

870
00:55:20,349 --> 00:55:21,373
Yes.

871
00:55:23,419 --> 00:55:26,479
Don't you think
you're overreacting just a little?

872
00:55:26,589 --> 00:55:29,615
Me? You know what?
Never mind, Frank.

873
00:55:30,826 --> 00:55:34,091
You know,
you were gonna spank the boys...

874
00:55:34,196 --> 00:55:36,926
over wrecking
your silly organizational chart...

875
00:55:37,032 --> 00:55:39,159
but I'm not allowed to be upset
about my studio.

876
00:55:39,268 --> 00:55:43,261
I was not going to spank them.
And charts are not silly.

877
00:55:43,505 --> 00:55:46,633
Do you know what happens
to a ship in chaos? It sinks.

878
00:55:46,742 --> 00:55:51,406
Homes are for free expression,
not for good impressions.

879
00:55:51,513 --> 00:55:55,449
Well, I'm sorry, but in the military,
there's little room for free expression.

880
00:55:55,551 --> 00:55:59,248
Except for that we're not in the military,
Frank. You are.

881
00:56:01,757 --> 00:56:05,693
I just thought that you would work better
in a clean studio.

882
00:56:05,794 --> 00:56:08,422
I knew it! I knew you put them up to it.

883
00:56:08,530 --> 00:56:10,498
I most certainly did not!

884
00:56:10,599 --> 00:56:15,400
No, maybe not directly,
but in that whole orderly, military...

885
00:56:15,804 --> 00:56:18,204
regimented brainwashing thing.

886
00:56:18,607 --> 00:56:21,508
- You left out anal-retentive.
- Oh, and that, too.

887
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:23,202
Is that what you think?

888
00:56:25,281 --> 00:56:27,841
Yes, that's what I think.

889
00:56:28,918 --> 00:56:32,877
Then I think
that I'm sleeping somewhere else.

890
00:56:39,428 --> 00:56:40,861
I'm gonna fix that.

891
00:56:56,111 --> 00:56:57,635
Officer asleep.

892
00:57:16,865 --> 00:57:18,230
Go, Kelly!

893
00:57:19,635 --> 00:57:20,932
Go, Kelly!

894
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:25,131
<i>Be, be aggressive! Be aggressive!</i>

895
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:29,939
<i>Be, be aggressive! Be aggressive!
Be, be aggressive!</i>

896
00:57:30,045 --> 00:57:31,535
<i>Be aggressive!</i>

897
00:57:31,814 --> 00:57:36,649
<i>Now put your hands up in the air
and wave them like you just don't care</i>

898
00:57:36,986 --> 00:57:41,787
<i>And if you think that Kelly is the best
let me hear you say, "Oh, yeah!"</i>

899
00:57:41,924 --> 00:57:43,050
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

900
00:57:43,158 --> 00:57:45,217
<i>- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah!</i>

901
00:57:45,327 --> 00:57:49,320
<i>Go, Kelly. Go, Kelly
The other team is</i>

902
00:57:50,265 --> 00:57:51,391
<i>Smelly</i>

903
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:54,264
<i>- They're quaking like they're
- Jelly!</i>

904
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:56,964
<i>- We got sisters from
- New Delhi!</i>

905
00:57:57,072 --> 00:57:59,438
<i>- Go, Kelly!
- Go, Kelly!</i>

906
00:57:59,541 --> 00:58:01,839
<i>The other team is smelly!</i>

907
00:58:01,944 --> 00:58:04,105
<i>They're quaking like they're jelly!</i>

908
00:58:04,213 --> 00:58:06,613
<i>We got sisters from New Delhi!</i>

909
00:58:06,715 --> 00:58:08,273
Go, Kelly!

910
00:58:08,384 --> 00:58:10,079
Okay, phase two.

911
00:58:10,185 --> 00:58:13,848
I think that we just need one more
big thing to push them over the edge.

912
00:58:13,956 --> 00:58:15,947
Have them catch
you and Phoebe together?

913
00:58:16,058 --> 00:58:17,355
You're really sick.

914
00:58:17,459 --> 00:58:19,586
Okay, then have them catch
you and Phoebe together.

915
00:58:19,695 --> 00:58:21,788
How about they catch me
with my hands around your neck?

916
00:58:21,897 --> 00:58:24,229
Listen, the Commandant's coming
this weekend.

917
00:58:24,333 --> 00:58:27,666
They have to go to the trustees' dinner,
and Mrs. Munion has the weekend off.

918
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:30,762
Two words, "par" and "ty."

919
00:58:31,907 --> 00:58:34,034
- Party.
- Yeah, I got that.

920
00:58:34,143 --> 00:58:37,408
No, it's a perfect idea, because Mom
won't care and Frank's gonna hate it.

921
00:58:37,513 --> 00:58:39,572
You guys ready? Let's get to work.

922
00:58:40,249 --> 00:58:41,443
Oh, no, I can't!

923
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:44,348
I still have to make, like, a million
of these posters for the election!

924
00:58:44,453 --> 00:58:46,444
Yeah, for what, the class of '59?

925
00:58:46,555 --> 00:58:49,547
You couldn't get elected hall monitor
with this. Here.

926
00:58:51,326 --> 00:58:53,658
Imagine this
in a three-color spray paint.

927
00:58:54,830 --> 00:58:57,355
Nice. And I know
some great campaign workers.

928
00:59:00,235 --> 00:59:01,793
William Beardsley for president, okay?

929
00:59:01,904 --> 00:59:04,737
Vote for William Beardsley!
Vote William Beardsley!

930
00:59:07,142 --> 00:59:10,236
Hey, Brad.
Vote William Beardsley. Great guy.

931
00:59:10,345 --> 00:59:11,312
Okay.

932
00:59:12,948 --> 00:59:14,006
What?

933
00:59:14,983 --> 00:59:16,041
Thank you.

934
00:59:16,251 --> 00:59:18,776
Thank you. William Beardsley for
president.

935
00:59:18,887 --> 00:59:19,854
Vote for Beardsley.

936
00:59:20,422 --> 00:59:22,890
Vote for Will! Vote for Will!

937
00:59:23,959 --> 00:59:26,484
- Here you go!
- Thanks.

938
00:59:33,735 --> 00:59:35,794
This could actually help get me elected.

939
00:59:35,904 --> 00:59:38,964
Yeah. Somebody might actually think
you're cool...

940
00:59:39,074 --> 00:59:40,735
if they didn't know you.

941
00:59:41,944 --> 00:59:43,138
That's funny.

942
00:59:44,646 --> 00:59:45,874
We'll be home after midnight.

943
00:59:45,981 --> 00:59:47,608
Make sure
the kids don't stay up too late.

944
00:59:47,716 --> 00:59:49,684
Have fun at the trustee dinner.

945
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:52,014
- Ready?
- Yeah. One minute.

946
00:59:53,622 --> 00:59:55,146
Are you timing me?

947
00:59:55,591 --> 00:59:57,752
- No.
- No. Okay.

948
00:59:59,528 --> 01:00:00,688
- Hey, Mom.
- Yeah, honey.

949
01:00:00,796 --> 01:00:03,765
William and I were wondering if we
could have a couple friends over.

950
01:00:03,866 --> 01:00:06,562
You know, after we put
the little kids to sleep?

951
01:00:07,703 --> 01:00:09,227
Unbelievable.

952
01:00:09,638 --> 01:00:11,162
Can we, Mom?

953
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,738
Yeah, sweetheart.
You have a good time. Okay, honey?

954
01:00:13,842 --> 01:00:15,867
- Thanks. You, too.
- All right, sweetheart.

955
01:00:16,445 --> 01:00:19,312
She went for it.
So, where are the little kids?

956
01:00:19,848 --> 01:00:21,076
I got them covered.

957
01:00:23,619 --> 01:00:26,019
Root beer chug!

958
01:00:40,702 --> 01:00:42,294
Ladies and gentlemen...

959
01:00:43,238 --> 01:00:47,402
first of all, I wanna thank
Admiral Beardsley and his wife Helen...

960
01:00:47,509 --> 01:00:49,477
for this wonderful evening.

961
01:00:49,811 --> 01:00:53,178
Frank, you run a tight ship.

962
01:00:53,415 --> 01:00:55,474
You ought to see me on the water.

963
01:00:55,918 --> 01:00:59,547
That's why, tonight,
I'm gonna offer my recommendation...

964
01:00:59,888 --> 01:01:02,652
that Admiral Frank Beardsley...

965
01:01:03,825 --> 01:01:06,293
be my successor as Commandant.

966
01:01:11,066 --> 01:01:14,832
You know, Frank,
being Commandant, you'll be at sea...

967
01:01:15,404 --> 01:01:17,372
wishing that you were home.

968
01:01:17,573 --> 01:01:20,906
Or you'll be in Washington,
wishing that you were at sea!

969
01:01:21,577 --> 01:01:23,807
Let's all stand and applaud...

970
01:01:24,246 --> 01:01:27,579
Commandant Frank Beardsley.

971
01:01:35,290 --> 01:01:37,520
Thank you, Commandant Sherman.

972
01:01:38,894 --> 01:01:40,555
I know that...

973
01:01:42,397 --> 01:01:45,992
this command is
an incredible opportunity...

974
01:01:47,102 --> 01:01:48,729
and a great honor.

975
01:01:49,504 --> 01:01:52,302
But I've just started here
at the Academy...

976
01:01:53,508 --> 01:01:57,410
and it would not be fair to my cadets...

977
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:01,176
nor would it be fair to my new family...

978
01:02:01,984 --> 01:02:04,544
who just about outnumber the cadets.

979
01:02:08,223 --> 01:02:09,690
And so, sir...

980
01:02:10,259 --> 01:02:14,491
I must respectfully decline.

981
01:02:15,397 --> 01:02:19,390
And I hope that you know
how honored I am.

982
01:02:26,708 --> 01:02:29,040
Think you might reconsider?
You wanna sleep on it?

983
01:02:29,144 --> 01:02:31,169
No, sir, I'm sure. Thank you.

984
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:33,641
I'll do it.

985
01:02:33,749 --> 01:02:35,614
Get a load of this guy.

986
01:02:37,419 --> 01:02:39,887
You wanna sleep on it. I understand.

987
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:56,036
<i>All the girls and the boys and people
making noises, let me hear you shout</i>

988
01:02:56,138 --> 01:02:57,196
<i>Bring them out, bring them out</i>

989
01:02:57,306 --> 01:03:01,072
<i>Pump up your fists in a twist like this
till the lights go out</i>

990
01:03:01,176 --> 01:03:02,302
<i>Bring them out, bring them out</i>

991
01:03:02,411 --> 01:03:06,905
<i>Wake up, I'm calling you up
I need a ride</i>

992
01:03:07,015 --> 01:03:11,179
<i>We're gonna shake up
So hurry it up, no wasting time</i>

993
01:03:11,286 --> 01:03:13,379
- What's going on, baby?
- What are you doing?

994
01:03:13,488 --> 01:03:15,581
Oh, don't worry.
Look, I'm making the money...

995
01:03:15,691 --> 01:03:18,626
but I'm gonna split it with everybody,
minus a 10% service fee.

996
01:03:18,727 --> 01:03:20,695
<i>Maybe with some other friends of mine</i>

997
01:03:20,796 --> 01:03:22,491
<i>Someone's coming round to pick him up</i>

998
01:03:22,597 --> 01:03:25,862
<i>Right now I want the girls and the boys
and people making noise</i>

999
01:03:25,967 --> 01:03:28,299
<i>Let me hear you shout</i>

1000
01:03:28,437 --> 01:03:30,302
What is this? I didn't order any beer.

1001
01:03:30,405 --> 01:03:33,738
Don't look at me. I just wanted
to break our parents up, not go to jail!

1002
01:03:33,842 --> 01:03:37,801
<i>Yeah, I don't know why I even try</i>

1003
01:03:37,913 --> 01:03:41,144
- I didn't order pizza.
- Well, somebody did.

1004
01:03:41,283 --> 01:03:45,344
And somebody owes me $379, plus tip.

1005
01:03:45,454 --> 01:03:48,480
- $379?
- Plus tip.

1006
01:03:48,924 --> 01:03:50,482
I'll be right back.

1007
01:03:55,997 --> 01:03:57,294
Gross.

1008
01:03:58,367 --> 01:04:00,995
Yo, Christina. Cool party.

1009
01:04:01,403 --> 01:04:02,734
Hey, Nick.

1010
01:04:04,139 --> 01:04:06,630
Phoebe's out
trying to raise money for pizza.

1011
01:04:07,676 --> 01:04:10,440
- Maybe I came to see you.
- Me?

1012
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:14,938
Wow.
I can't believe you're really into me.

1013
01:04:15,217 --> 01:04:17,310
You're hot. Why wouldn't I be?

1014
01:04:17,419 --> 01:04:20,115
I don't know. Maybe because...

1015
01:04:23,525 --> 01:04:25,652
Phoebe is my sister.

1016
01:04:29,564 --> 01:04:31,930
- Hey, Phoebe.
- Get lost, loser.

1017
01:04:37,139 --> 01:04:40,131
- Look, I'm really sorry.
- No, no, I'm so sorry.

1018
01:04:40,242 --> 01:04:43,234
Let's promise never to let boys
come between us again.

1019
01:04:43,378 --> 01:04:45,972
Yeah, like that's really gonna happen.

1020
01:04:48,483 --> 01:04:49,677
Come on.

1021
01:04:56,458 --> 01:04:57,755
Oh, no.

1022
01:04:58,693 --> 01:05:00,661
Yo, what's up, dude?

1023
01:05:07,335 --> 01:05:10,304
Let's just take a deep breath, Frank.

1024
01:05:16,077 --> 01:05:17,669
Yo, B, nice hat.

1025
01:05:17,779 --> 01:05:19,110
Ahoy, matey.

1026
01:05:21,316 --> 01:05:22,613
Oh, boy.

1027
01:05:22,717 --> 01:05:25,618
- Jimi, I've been looking all over for...
- There you go.

1028
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:26,914
Phoebe!

1029
01:05:27,556 --> 01:05:30,150
- Hi.
- What is going on here?

1030
01:05:30,692 --> 01:05:32,887
Mom said that
we could have some people over.

1031
01:05:32,994 --> 01:05:34,461
- You agreed to this?
- No.

1032
01:05:34,563 --> 01:05:37,123
Phoebe, I said
you could have a few friends over.

1033
01:05:37,232 --> 01:05:39,097
I did not agree to this.

1034
01:05:39,668 --> 01:05:42,660
Where's everybody else?
Where are the little kids?

1035
01:05:43,605 --> 01:05:48,508
Need more chocolate.

1036
01:06:08,063 --> 01:06:11,328
Would everyone who lives here
please raise your hand?

1037
01:06:15,403 --> 01:06:18,600
Anyone else remaining here
after five minutes...

1038
01:06:18,707 --> 01:06:22,507
will be forcibly conscripted
into the United States Coast Guard.

1039
01:06:37,292 --> 01:06:39,954
Sir, there is the matter of $379, plus...

1040
01:06:44,366 --> 01:06:45,765
Kitchen!

1041
01:06:46,601 --> 01:06:48,592
All right, everybody fall in!

1042
01:06:49,371 --> 01:06:51,134
I said, "Fall in!"

1043
01:06:51,273 --> 01:06:55,175
Dylan, Phoebe,
I am very disappointed in both of you.

1044
01:06:55,277 --> 01:06:58,110
Disappointed?
Is that what you are, Helen?

1045
01:06:58,213 --> 01:06:59,646
Disappointed?

1046
01:06:59,748 --> 01:07:02,546
- William, Christina, front and center.
- Frank, take it easy.

1047
01:07:02,651 --> 01:07:03,743
No, Helen.

1048
01:07:03,852 --> 01:07:08,414
There has been enough taking it easy
around here. That clearly doesn't work.

1049
01:07:08,657 --> 01:07:11,490
I should have never gone
against my better judgment.

1050
01:07:11,593 --> 01:07:13,584
This is why we have rules.

1051
01:07:13,695 --> 01:07:16,528
Do you hear yourself?
Because it's not all about rules.

1052
01:07:16,631 --> 01:07:19,099
You sound like some military robot,
Frank!

1053
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:24,035
<i>Yeah? Well, you sound like a big
Free To Be You and Me flake.</i>

1054
01:07:29,878 --> 01:07:32,938
You have one hour
to get this place cleaned up.

1055
01:07:42,123 --> 01:07:44,853
There is nothing wrong
with having rules.

1056
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:48,452
Everybody lives by them.
The entire universe lives by them.

1057
01:07:48,563 --> 01:07:51,862
Well, then, Frank, that's the last thing
these kids need from me.

1058
01:07:51,967 --> 01:07:53,935
There's only one rule I know,
and that's...

1059
01:07:54,035 --> 01:07:57,903
"At any time, all of this could be over,
taken away from you forever."

1060
01:07:58,006 --> 01:08:00,338
And then who needs more rules
after that?

1061
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:08,538
I can't live like this anymore, Frank,
and neither can my kids.

1062
01:08:08,650 --> 01:08:10,379
I don't know how yours do it.

1063
01:08:10,485 --> 01:08:14,854
My kids got along just fine
until we moved in together.

1064
01:08:15,690 --> 01:08:19,319
- Everything was shipshape.
- Oh, Frank.

1065
01:08:19,928 --> 01:08:22,726
It's obvious that
we got into this way too fast.

1066
01:08:23,231 --> 01:08:26,632
I thought we could just pick up
where we left off in high school.

1067
01:08:26,735 --> 01:08:30,000
But maybe that's a lot longer ago
than we both realized.

1068
01:08:31,239 --> 01:08:33,036
Maybe it was.

1069
01:08:38,279 --> 01:08:40,270
Hey, you know what, Frank?

1070
01:08:41,616 --> 01:08:43,675
I think you should take that job.

1071
01:08:43,785 --> 01:08:46,777
- I told you, I don't want to take the...
- No, just come on!

1072
01:08:46,888 --> 01:08:49,823
We both know what your
better judgment is telling you, okay?

1073
01:08:49,924 --> 01:08:52,392
You know what?
Just please go. Just go.

1074
01:08:57,298 --> 01:09:00,324
Does this mean you're not
going to be my brother anymore?

1075
01:09:00,435 --> 01:09:01,868
I don't know.

1076
01:09:09,711 --> 01:09:13,238
Let's get this party started.
Who wants a double-stuffed?

1077
01:09:17,118 --> 01:09:19,678
Helen cried herself to sleep tonight.

1078
01:09:20,021 --> 01:09:22,717
We should be ashamed.
It's all our fault.

1079
01:09:23,258 --> 01:09:27,888
Yeah. My mom was happier with your
dorky dad than I've seen her in years.

1080
01:09:28,730 --> 01:09:30,459
And we totally screwed it up.

1081
01:09:30,565 --> 01:09:34,399
But this is what we wanted, remember?
Two separate families.

1082
01:09:34,502 --> 01:09:37,562
Yeah, but I didn't know
it would feel like this.

1083
01:09:37,939 --> 01:09:39,031
Yeah.

1084
01:10:15,643 --> 01:10:17,770
<i>- Hello?
- Hi.</i>

1085
01:10:19,214 --> 01:10:20,476
It's me.

1086
01:10:21,716 --> 01:10:22,876
Hi.

1087
01:10:24,152 --> 01:10:28,088
<i>I've been thinking a lot
about what you said...</i>

1088
01:10:29,257 --> 01:10:31,088
and I...

1089
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:36,358
I think maybe I will take that job.

1090
01:10:53,381 --> 01:10:54,541
Well...

1091
01:10:55,683 --> 01:10:58,584
you know, Frank,
we have to talk to the kids.

1092
01:11:01,656 --> 01:11:03,146
I'll tell them.

1093
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:06,918
Okay.

1094
01:11:11,733 --> 01:11:14,224
<i>Well, I'll see you.</i>

1095
01:11:15,136 --> 01:11:16,364
Goodbye.

1096
01:11:30,018 --> 01:11:32,885
Hey, look who it is. It's the freaks.

1097
01:11:33,354 --> 01:11:35,948
Yeah, why don't you go home
to your shoe?

1098
01:11:36,057 --> 01:11:39,652
- Shut up!
- Did you just tell him to shut up?

1099
01:11:39,761 --> 01:11:41,729
Is there a problem, punk?

1100
01:11:42,163 --> 01:11:43,187
What's it to you?

1101
01:11:43,298 --> 01:11:46,426
You mess with my brothers,
you mess with me.

1102
01:11:47,635 --> 01:11:49,125
- Sure.
- And me.

1103
01:11:49,237 --> 01:11:51,330
- And me.
- And me.

1104
01:11:51,439 --> 01:11:53,066
- And me.
- And me.

1105
01:11:53,174 --> 01:11:54,641
And me.

1106
01:11:54,742 --> 01:11:56,232
It's all good.

1107
01:11:56,544 --> 01:12:00,640
Otter, are these the kids
that have a problem with big families?

1108
01:12:00,748 --> 01:12:04,445
- They say we share our underpants.
- That's just ignorance.

1109
01:12:04,786 --> 01:12:07,448
And do you know
how to stop ignorance?

1110
01:12:08,656 --> 01:12:10,385
- Education?
- Close.

1111
01:12:10,792 --> 01:12:12,259
Butt-whupping.

1112
01:12:13,061 --> 01:12:15,791
- Let's go!
- Come on!

1113
01:12:18,566 --> 01:12:19,999
Hey, what's going on, guys?

1114
01:12:20,101 --> 01:12:22,194
Just some kids
messing with our little brothers.

1115
01:12:22,303 --> 01:12:24,703
- But we handled it.
- Family style!

1116
01:12:24,806 --> 01:12:26,899
William! You won the election!

1117
01:12:29,878 --> 01:12:32,847
Does this mean that you move
to the White House?

1118
01:12:37,585 --> 01:12:40,850
- Way to go, Willie.
- Couldn't have done it without you, Bro.

1119
01:13:21,996 --> 01:13:23,486
Dad, guess what happened today
at school?

1120
01:13:23,598 --> 01:13:24,565
Hey, I wanna tell him.

1121
01:13:24,666 --> 01:13:26,133
Have you ever heard yourself
tell a story?

1122
01:13:26,234 --> 01:13:27,326
You have a tendency of rambling.

1123
01:13:27,435 --> 01:13:29,130
Okay, listen up, guys!

1124
01:13:30,471 --> 01:13:32,564
I have something important to say.

1125
01:13:34,809 --> 01:13:37,243
- We're leaving?
- What? No.

1126
01:13:37,378 --> 01:13:38,606
Do we have to leave?

1127
01:13:38,713 --> 01:13:40,840
Look, just 'cause
you and Mom had a little fight...

1128
01:13:40,949 --> 01:13:43,281
- that's no reason...
- It was a big fight.

1129
01:13:44,819 --> 01:13:47,014
This whole thing is our fault.

1130
01:13:49,757 --> 01:13:53,659
We tried to make all of you
live with people...

1131
01:13:53,761 --> 01:13:56,457
that you have nothing in common with...

1132
01:13:57,532 --> 01:13:59,932
and that was self-centered of us.

1133
01:14:00,234 --> 01:14:01,963
It was pigheaded.

1134
01:14:02,136 --> 01:14:04,604
And I'd like to talk about this more...

1135
01:14:04,706 --> 01:14:06,867
but my ship sails in a half-hour.

1136
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:08,567
Where are you going?

1137
01:14:08,676 --> 01:14:11,611
I have to visit all the commands
on the East Coast...

1138
01:14:11,713 --> 01:14:13,806
to prep for my new job.

1139
01:14:15,516 --> 01:14:17,814
So let's lose the long faces.

1140
01:14:25,059 --> 01:14:29,496
Now, if you ever need anything,
that means all of you North kids...

1141
01:14:31,632 --> 01:14:35,124
you just call me. I'll be there. Got it?

1142
01:14:38,573 --> 01:14:40,006
Bye, Frank.

1143
01:14:45,313 --> 01:14:47,042
William, you know the routine.

1144
01:14:47,148 --> 01:14:50,379
Mrs. Munion will bring you down
to Washington once I get us set up.

1145
01:14:50,485 --> 01:14:52,350
- But you can't go.
- Come on, Dad.

1146
01:14:52,453 --> 01:14:54,216
- Please!
- Please.

1147
01:14:54,689 --> 01:14:55,883
Listen.

1148
01:14:56,324 --> 01:15:00,454
I promise everything will be
exactly as it was before.

1149
01:15:01,062 --> 01:15:02,893
This is our last move.

1150
01:15:07,802 --> 01:15:09,269
I have to go.

1151
01:15:20,048 --> 01:15:23,211
You're not gonna tell him
you won Class President?

1152
01:15:24,385 --> 01:15:26,876
- Doesn't matter anymore.
- What are you gonna do?

1153
01:15:26,988 --> 01:15:29,821
I'm gonna pack and we're gonna move,
just like every other time.

1154
01:15:29,924 --> 01:15:32,916
So that's it? We're just gonna give in
and let this happen?

1155
01:15:33,027 --> 01:15:36,190
- You know the drill, Christina.
- William, wait! Wait!

1156
01:15:36,297 --> 01:15:37,924
- What?
- Please...

1157
01:15:38,199 --> 01:15:40,599
I don't wanna lose another mommy.

1158
01:15:40,968 --> 01:15:42,560
He's right.

1159
01:15:57,085 --> 01:15:59,485
Well, then I guess
we better stop that boat.

1160
01:15:59,587 --> 01:16:01,350
- Yay!
- Yay!

1161
01:16:02,457 --> 01:16:04,948
Kelly! Some of you guys
should stay here and wait for Mom.

1162
01:16:05,059 --> 01:16:07,459
- Got it.
- All right, as for the rest of us...

1163
01:16:07,562 --> 01:16:09,029
let's do this.

1164
01:16:09,564 --> 01:16:12,260
Ship's company! Atten-hut!

1165
01:16:21,642 --> 01:16:23,610
I know how to cheer Mom up.

1166
01:16:23,711 --> 01:16:26,145
Let's put her room back
to the way she likes it.

1167
01:16:26,247 --> 01:16:27,976
- Yeah!
- Let's do it!

1168
01:16:46,801 --> 01:16:47,927
Lau!

1169
01:17:19,834 --> 01:17:21,028
Help!

1170
01:17:23,037 --> 01:17:24,834
Mrs. Munion!

1171
01:17:31,045 --> 01:17:34,947
- Oh, my God!
- Mrs. Munion!

1172
01:17:36,617 --> 01:17:38,278
Help!

1173
01:17:39,654 --> 01:17:42,282
Hold on! Hold on!

1174
01:17:48,629 --> 01:17:49,926
Surprise!

1175
01:17:50,131 --> 01:17:52,258
Mrs. Munion, what is going on?

1176
01:17:52,733 --> 01:17:55,793
I was just vacuuming up a storm and...

1177
01:17:55,903 --> 01:17:58,030
Where is everybody?
Where are the big kids?

1178
01:17:58,139 --> 01:18:00,198
They all went to go stop Dad.

1179
01:18:00,308 --> 01:18:02,469
And we stayed here
to mess the place up...

1180
01:18:02,577 --> 01:18:05,171
because you were so mad
when we cleaned it up.

1181
01:18:05,279 --> 01:18:07,804
We changed our minds
about the plan to break you up.

1182
01:18:07,915 --> 01:18:09,906
We like living together.

1183
01:18:10,351 --> 01:18:12,410
You planned to break us up?

1184
01:18:15,156 --> 01:18:17,590
- Oh? Come on, kids. Come on.
- No, Mom.

1185
01:18:17,692 --> 01:18:20,559
- What? We have to go.
- Remember the old you?

1186
01:18:21,262 --> 01:18:23,093
Spanking is never the answer.

1187
01:18:23,197 --> 01:18:26,724
No, honey, no spanking. Come on, kids.
I know what we need to do.

1188
01:18:32,039 --> 01:18:35,031
- Commandant on the bridge.
- Welcome aboard, sir.

1189
01:18:35,276 --> 01:18:37,608
- Happy to be aboard.
- Thank you, sir.

1190
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:41,139
Admiral, we've cleared the seaboard.
We're ready to pick up full speed.

1191
01:18:41,249 --> 01:18:45,379
Ask Admiral Beardsley.
Soon it's all gonna be his.

1192
01:18:45,753 --> 01:18:48,187
Frank, you give the orders.

1193
01:18:50,524 --> 01:18:52,492
Awaiting your command, Admiral.

1194
01:18:54,061 --> 01:18:56,359
- All stop!
- All stop, aye!

1195
01:19:30,431 --> 01:19:31,955
Now what?

1196
01:19:33,467 --> 01:19:34,934
It's my kids.

1197
01:19:39,473 --> 01:19:42,408
- Drop the sail.
- Yes, sir, Captain.

1198
01:19:42,510 --> 01:19:44,603
- Secure those lines.
- Securing lines.

1199
01:19:44,712 --> 01:19:47,704
- Prepare to come alongside.
- Aye, aye, sir.

1200
01:19:51,819 --> 01:19:54,913
- What are you doing here?
- Stopping you!

1201
01:19:55,022 --> 01:19:57,422
Dad, we have a confession.

1202
01:19:57,525 --> 01:20:00,187
We were behind everything,
all the fights.

1203
01:20:00,294 --> 01:20:01,955
We tried to break you and Mom up...

1204
01:20:02,063 --> 01:20:03,928
so we could go back
to the way things were.

1205
01:20:04,031 --> 01:20:05,555
We made a huge mistake.

1206
01:20:05,666 --> 01:20:08,134
And we realize
that we should all be a family.

1207
01:20:08,235 --> 01:20:10,863
- Come on, Dad! Come on home.
- We need to be together!

1208
01:20:10,971 --> 01:20:13,405
- Come on, Dad, let's go home!
- We need you.

1209
01:20:14,008 --> 01:20:17,307
I'm sorry, guys. It's already too late.

1210
01:20:17,411 --> 01:20:19,606
Your mom is really...

1211
01:20:34,995 --> 01:20:37,259
My beautiful lighthouse keeper.

1212
01:20:57,284 --> 01:20:58,911
I'm sorry.

1213
01:20:59,887 --> 01:21:01,286
I am, too.

1214
01:21:03,557 --> 01:21:06,754
- This is where I belong.
- Yeah.

1215
01:21:07,661 --> 01:21:09,595
And I think my kids agree.

1216
01:21:09,697 --> 01:21:12,188
- Yeah!
- Your kids?

1217
01:21:14,201 --> 01:21:15,463
Our kids.

1218
01:21:18,038 --> 01:21:21,030
- Will you marry me again?
- Yeah.

1219
01:21:21,809 --> 01:21:24,744
Only this time, the right way.

1220
01:21:25,079 --> 01:21:26,273
Hi.

1221
01:21:43,631 --> 01:21:45,599
- You know what we need?
- What?

1222
01:21:45,699 --> 01:21:47,599
Group hug!

1223
01:22:22,903 --> 01:22:23,995
- Hi, you've reached Frank.

1224
01:22:24,104 --> 01:22:25,071

1233
01:22:33,848 --> 01:22:36,112
- Leave your message at the beep.
- Yeah!
