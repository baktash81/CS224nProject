1
00:00:33,164 --> 00:00:35,486
<i>My name is Chance.</i>

2
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:37,549
<i>I know it sounds odd, but...</i>

3
00:00:37,627 --> 00:00:40,104
<i>most names do if you think
about 'em long enough.</i>

4
00:00:40,186 --> 00:00:41,908
<i>Maybe, even yours.</i>

5
00:00:42,361 --> 00:00:44,502
<i>I was abandoned when I was very young.</i>

6
00:00:44,564 --> 00:00:46,572
<i>I lived on the streets,
scrounging for food,</i>

7
00:00:46,612 --> 00:00:48,174
<i>sleeping wherever I could.</i>

8
00:00:48,218 --> 00:00:50,346
<i>That seemed like fun at first, but...</i>

9
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,822
<i>pretty soon it landed me behind bars.</i>

10
00:00:54,508 --> 00:00:56,418
<i>But, I don't like to talk about that.</i>

11
00:00:56,487 --> 00:00:58,081
<i>Let's talk about after that.</i>

12
00:00:58,152 --> 00:01:00,049
<i>When I got my second chance.</i>

13
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:01,674
<i>And my name.</i>

14
00:01:02,349 --> 00:01:04,706
<i>You see, this family came along, and...</i>

15
00:01:04,755 --> 00:01:06,674
<i>I guess you could say,
they rescued me.</i>

16
00:01:06,781 --> 00:01:10,331
<i>Because they adopted me and brought me
to live with them at their house.</i>

17
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:13,411
<i>But, it was their home, not mine.</i>

18
00:01:13,727 --> 00:01:15,782
<i>Still, it sure was an improvement over,</i>

19
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,731
<i>well over that other place.</i>

20
00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:19,715
<i>Lots of space...</i>

21
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:21,247
<i>fresh air...</i>

22
00:01:21,354 --> 00:01:23,799
<i>plenty of interesting things to explore...</i>

23
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:26,497
<i>and all the underwear I could eat.</i>

24
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,793
- Chance!
- Sassy?

25
00:01:32,899 --> 00:01:35,965
You've just woke me up
from a very deep catnap.

26
00:01:36,014 --> 00:01:39,184
What's the matter, Sassy? You get up
on the wrong side of the litter box?

27
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:43,004
Even a very great beauty
needs her beauty sleep!

28
00:01:43,067 --> 00:01:44,083
Beauty sleep?

29
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:46,146
You'd have to sleep for like a month.

30
00:01:46,192 --> 00:01:49,239
Oh, you are such a typical dog.

31
00:01:49,503 --> 00:01:52,729
<i>Indeed. The house was full of
new clothes to be shredded...</i>

32
00:01:52,824 --> 00:01:54,865
<i>on account of the family was growing.</i>

33
00:01:54,924 --> 00:01:57,881
<i>You see, Bob was joining
the family by marrying Laura.</i>

34
00:01:57,999 --> 00:01:59,572
<i>Her little girl was Hope.</i>

35
00:01:59,665 --> 00:02:01,930
<i>- Hope belonged to Sassy.</i>
- Jamie.

36
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:04,322
<i>The little boy, Jamie,
was supposed to belong to me,</i>

37
00:02:04,347 --> 00:02:06,127
<i>but I didn't need anyone else.</i>

38
00:02:06,177 --> 00:02:08,370
<i>- I was a loner.</i>
- Ew!

39
00:02:11,126 --> 00:02:13,306
<i>Still, I had to admit it...</i>

40
00:02:13,361 --> 00:02:15,619
<i>he did have a lot of very good ideas.</i>

41
00:02:15,717 --> 00:02:18,001
<i>He was the one who named me Chance.</i>

42
00:02:18,048 --> 00:02:20,150
<i>Laura's older boy was Peter.</i>

43
00:02:20,254 --> 00:02:21,712
<i>He belonged to Shadow.</i>

44
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:23,307
<i>Shadow was faithful.</i>

45
00:02:23,369 --> 00:02:24,806
<i>Shadow was loyal.</i>

46
00:02:24,893 --> 00:02:26,548
<i>Shadow was a chump.</i>

47
00:02:26,626 --> 00:02:29,962
<i>He just sat down there
while I had all the fun upstairs.</i>

48
00:02:30,119 --> 00:02:32,025
Chance, stop!

49
00:02:32,111 --> 00:02:33,478
The blouse is dead.

50
00:02:33,543 --> 00:02:35,572
That's right, but I gotta shred it...

51
00:02:35,597 --> 00:02:40,103
into teeny, tiny little pieces,
and I really...

52
00:02:41,009 --> 00:02:42,408
I swallowed a button.

53
00:02:42,447 --> 00:02:44,439
Oh, what a shame!

54
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:45,900
Too bad it wasn't a zipper.

55
00:02:45,931 --> 00:02:49,456
Hey, you better beat it, powder puff,
or you're gonna end up dog meat.

56
00:02:49,488 --> 00:02:53,277
Oh, is that any way to speak
to a petite dewdrop?

57
00:02:53,308 --> 00:02:56,269
You big flat-faced butt-sniffer!

58
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,302
Shadow, down.

59
00:03:05,165 --> 00:03:08,248
I really should give that pup a talking-to.

60
00:03:12,363 --> 00:03:13,495
Uh...

61
00:03:13,542 --> 00:03:17,612
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

62
00:03:17,704 --> 00:03:20,073
You may kiss the bride.

63
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:22,059
Ew!

64
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:23,434
Oh.

65
00:03:32,707 --> 00:03:34,281
Who is this?

66
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,883
Eh, somebody new,

67
00:03:35,922 --> 00:03:38,859
'cause I, I never forget a face.

68
00:03:40,298 --> 00:03:42,250
Eh, whoa! Food!

69
00:03:42,313 --> 00:03:44,000
Food! Hello, food.

70
00:03:44,109 --> 00:03:46,125
Hey, wait, where-where-where
where you going?

71
00:03:46,367 --> 00:03:48,492
Hey, hey, you with the food,
drop it!

72
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:49,928
Drop it! Do it!

73
00:03:53,045 --> 00:03:54,967
Uh, they wanna serve that
on the floor, I think.

74
00:03:55,006 --> 00:03:57,366
Yeah, down here on the floor,
kind of an alfresco thing.

75
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,834
I know what I'll do,
I'll give him the look.

76
00:03:59,862 --> 00:04:02,216
I'm sorry, fella, not for doggies.

77
00:04:02,388 --> 00:04:03,419
Flying meat!

78
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,474
Whoa, oh, ah, oh, ah, oh, hot.

79
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:07,380
Hot, oh, hot, hot, hot!

80
00:04:07,405 --> 00:04:10,499
I wonder if I could have that dog stuffed.

81
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:12,857
Yech! Green stuff.
I hate that.

82
00:04:12,904 --> 00:04:14,403
Who eats this stuff?

83
00:04:14,638 --> 00:04:15,645
Bingo!

84
00:04:15,701 --> 00:04:17,724
Now we're talking turkey.

85
00:04:20,342 --> 00:04:21,986
Oh, back off, old man!

86
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,195
You're just jealous
'cause I smelled it first.

87
00:04:24,255 --> 00:04:27,306
Would a rolled-up newspaper
mean anything to you?

88
00:04:27,354 --> 00:04:29,221
No. Why?

89
00:04:30,247 --> 00:04:31,275
All right! Okay.

90
00:04:31,306 --> 00:04:33,135
Okay. Just wanted to smell it.

91
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:36,533
To make sure it was safe for people.

92
00:04:36,633 --> 00:04:39,080
I'm keeping my eye on you, pup.

93
00:04:39,158 --> 00:04:42,142
Yeah, well, I'm just gonna go,
uh, mingle.

94
00:04:42,244 --> 00:04:43,619
Hey, how are ya?
Nice to see ya!

95
00:04:43,682 --> 00:04:45,830
Hey, nice shoes.
I should know.

96
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:48,603
Hey uh, bud. Hey, nice tie.
How're ya doing?

97
00:04:48,658 --> 00:04:50,744
Hey, you want me to show you
a place where you can bury that food?

98
00:04:50,785 --> 00:04:53,002
What do you think?
Give me a little?

99
00:04:53,353 --> 00:04:54,719
Oh, ug, purr!

100
00:04:54,744 --> 00:04:55,830
Hasta la vista.

101
00:04:55,869 --> 00:04:57,017
What was that?

102
00:04:57,072 --> 00:04:58,807
Broccoli! Ptui!

103
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:01,634
They're not taking these pets
to San Francisco with them, are they?

104
00:05:01,674 --> 00:05:05,595
No. Laura has a friend from college
who has a ranch up near Bishop and...

105
00:05:05,658 --> 00:05:08,049
she's agreed to keep the animals
while they're gone.

106
00:05:08,087 --> 00:05:10,355
Ladies! Ladies, ladies,
please, you gotta help me.

107
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:12,300
I'm starving. I can't remember
when I had my last meal

108
00:05:12,325 --> 00:05:14,800
and I'm an orphan and I'm weak
and I'm helpless and if you don't feed me,

109
00:05:14,831 --> 00:05:17,039
I'll shrivel into a pile
of bleached bones, so please.

110
00:05:17,064 --> 00:05:17,925
- Go on, shoo!
- What, do you want?

111
00:05:17,956 --> 00:05:19,408
Shake a paw, shake hands?
How's that?

112
00:05:19,433 --> 00:05:21,042
Is it worth most of your food?
All your food?

113
00:05:21,073 --> 00:05:22,120
- Shoo, I said.
- Please.

114
00:05:22,162 --> 00:05:23,185
- Go on.
- Ah.

115
00:05:23,232 --> 00:05:24,818
Doesn't even know how to shake right.

116
00:05:24,873 --> 00:05:26,389
You need training.

117
00:05:26,521 --> 00:05:28,068
You need the training.

118
00:05:28,107 --> 00:05:30,693
Ah, great. And I suppose
you know a better way.

119
00:05:30,787 --> 00:05:32,787
Yes. I'll get food by...

120
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:34,795
acting like I don't want food.

121
00:05:34,849 --> 00:05:36,998
- That's stupid.
- I'll prove it.

122
00:05:37,022 --> 00:05:39,677
Oh, you don't have to prove it.
I believe you're stupid.

123
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,575
Oh, Sassy.

124
00:05:49,755 --> 00:05:52,106
I wish we didn't have to go away.

125
00:05:52,138 --> 00:05:54,247
I'm going to miss you so much.

126
00:05:54,302 --> 00:05:56,934
Just watch me work.

127
00:05:57,606 --> 00:05:59,114
Hungry?

128
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:00,864
No.

129
00:06:00,942 --> 00:06:02,286
But, it's shrimp.

130
00:06:02,341 --> 00:06:03,919
You like shrimp.

131
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,927
- I couldn't possibly.
- Come on.

132
00:06:05,973 --> 00:06:07,792
- It's good.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

133
00:06:07,817 --> 00:06:09,559
I can't. I, I just, I just can't.

134
00:06:09,598 --> 00:06:13,428
I have those four pesky ounces
still hanging on from Christmas.

135
00:06:13,453 --> 00:06:15,574
Oh, well, if you insist.

136
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:16,896
Told you.

137
00:06:16,944 --> 00:06:19,085
It works. I don't believe it.

138
00:06:19,187 --> 00:06:21,436
- Have another one.
- Oh, a twofer.

139
00:06:23,059 --> 00:06:24,460
I gotta remember this.

140
00:06:24,515 --> 00:06:26,841
It's like I said all along, poopsie:

141
00:06:26,866 --> 00:06:29,358
Cats rule and dogs drool.

142
00:06:29,405 --> 00:06:32,225
- Get a life. Get nine of 'em.
- Oh, it's true.

143
00:06:32,264 --> 00:06:34,303
Cats are smarter than dogs,

144
00:06:34,335 --> 00:06:35,803
and more attractive,

145
00:06:35,843 --> 00:06:38,022
and we don't drink from the toilet.

146
00:06:38,321 --> 00:06:39,571
Why not?

147
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,670
Uh-oh. Moving food. Gotta go.

148
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,922
Must follow. Must follow. Must follow.

149
00:06:43,968 --> 00:06:45,172
It's Peter against Shadow.

150
00:06:45,235 --> 00:06:47,183
- He's coming up!
- I'm gonna get it, Peter.

151
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,265
- Come on. I'm gonna get it.
- Peter steals it!

152
00:06:49,298 --> 00:06:50,523
- Shadow makes the jump.
- You gotta bounce it

153
00:06:50,548 --> 00:06:52,718
- better than that, boy.
- Shadow makes the jump. Peter takes it!

154
00:06:52,751 --> 00:06:55,265
- Come on. I'm gonna get it.
- Woo! Let's not forget the hook.

155
00:06:55,296 --> 00:06:56,351
Scores it! Oh!

156
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:59,319
- I can still do this pretty well, huh?
- Oh, the crowd's going wild.

157
00:06:59,433 --> 00:07:01,651
You're my favourite boy in the world.

158
00:07:01,681 --> 00:07:03,917
Oh, I love you, Peter.

159
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:05,722
<i>I hate this mushy stuff.</i>

160
00:07:05,762 --> 00:07:07,449
<i>I got a cake to catch.</i>

161
00:07:10,168 --> 00:07:11,636
Hey, guys.

162
00:07:12,631 --> 00:07:16,168
You know, Shadow's gonna have a ball
at Kate's ranch, aren't ya, boy?

163
00:07:16,277 --> 00:07:18,918
Gonna be sunshine and fresh air and...

164
00:07:19,011 --> 00:07:20,115
lots of room to run.

165
00:07:20,154 --> 00:07:23,552
I still don't see why we can't
take him to San Francisco with us.

166
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:28,971
Peter, I want him to be able
to go as much as you do.

167
00:07:29,172 --> 00:07:31,618
We gotta think about
what's best for Shadow, don't we?

168
00:07:31,665 --> 00:07:33,657
- Well, yeah.
- I mean, we're gonna be

169
00:07:33,688 --> 00:07:36,142
living in pretty tight conditions.

170
00:07:36,172 --> 00:07:38,008
Besides, my work there is temporary.

171
00:07:38,047 --> 00:07:40,001
We'll be back before you know it.

172
00:07:40,266 --> 00:07:41,698
What if he doesn't understand?

173
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:43,644
What if he thinks
I abandoned him or something?

174
00:07:43,682 --> 00:07:45,159
Are you kidding?

175
00:07:45,347 --> 00:07:48,309
He's gonna be so busy chasing horses
and bothering chickens,

176
00:07:48,348 --> 00:07:49,362
and you're gonna be busy.

177
00:07:49,387 --> 00:07:51,364
There's tons of stuff
for both of you guys to do.

178
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:54,238
There's tons of stuff
we can do here, together.

179
00:07:58,864 --> 00:08:00,329
Yeah.

180
00:08:05,028 --> 00:08:06,751
Come on, Shadow.

181
00:08:09,988 --> 00:08:11,246
Ah!

182
00:08:11,426 --> 00:08:13,928
Okay. Now,
act like you don't want it.

183
00:08:13,965 --> 00:08:15,732
Attention, everyone.

184
00:08:16,092 --> 00:08:17,074
Going in.

185
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:20,228
Uh, my bride tells me
it's time to cut the cake.

186
00:08:20,314 --> 00:08:23,490
I hope you've all saved room
because the mother of the bride...

187
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:25,755
- made it herself.
- Oh! Aw!

188
00:08:28,678 --> 00:08:30,649
No, I couldn't possibly.
Really. I'm dieting.

189
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,211
- And I really couldn't have.
- Chance!

190
00:08:32,241 --> 00:08:34,946
I got a pound to lose off my hips
and I'm not sure--

191
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:37,930
Oh, man.
Don't ever do that. Sorry.

192
00:08:37,981 --> 00:08:40,289
Well, dig in everybody.
There's plenty for everyone.

193
00:08:40,324 --> 00:08:41,802
Ha, ha!

194
00:08:42,785 --> 00:08:44,076
No.

195
00:08:44,131 --> 00:08:46,248
Stay there.

196
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:47,988
Sassy.

197
00:08:48,045 --> 00:08:50,935
You have to stay there
or you can't play.

198
00:08:51,388 --> 00:08:53,584
<i>Cats are smarter than dogs, huh?</i>

199
00:08:53,609 --> 00:08:54,569
<i>Right.</i>

200
00:08:54,613 --> 00:08:56,826
<i>She doesn't even know
the meaning of the word "stay".</i>

201
00:08:56,873 --> 00:08:58,826
No. Stay there.

202
00:08:58,864 --> 00:09:01,976
<i>The savage beast spots
his unsuspecting victim.</i>

203
00:09:02,023 --> 00:09:04,452
<i>Slowly, he sneaks through the tall grass.</i>

204
00:09:04,484 --> 00:09:05,820
Don't even--

205
00:09:05,851 --> 00:09:07,539
<i>Moving in for the ambush.</i>

206
00:09:07,577 --> 00:09:09,033
Keep away from me, you mutt!

207
00:09:09,087 --> 00:09:10,148
He runs.

208
00:09:10,173 --> 00:09:11,712
He leaps.

209
00:09:12,235 --> 00:09:13,595
Yes!

210
00:09:18,614 --> 00:09:21,122
My poor baby!
Are you all right?

211
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:24,626
He threw me in the big litter box.

212
00:09:24,686 --> 00:09:26,147
Oh, nice shot, Chance.

213
00:09:26,187 --> 00:09:29,358
- That's why they call it the catapult.
- You got a lot to learn, pup.

214
00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:30,507
Call the vet now.

215
00:09:30,538 --> 00:09:32,913
I'm telling Mom
what your stupid dog did.

216
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,068
Every cheeky of all
my brothers and sisters,

217
00:09:35,093 --> 00:09:37,556
I've never in my life.
I think my fur is falling out.

218
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,235
- I'm losing my fur!
- Hey, it's time to hit the road, guys!

219
00:09:40,274 --> 00:09:43,009
I wanna get going
before it gets too late.

220
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:44,414
- Luggage?
- Come on.

221
00:09:44,439 --> 00:09:45,939
Why luggage?

222
00:09:47,368 --> 00:09:48,399
I think...

223
00:09:48,439 --> 00:09:50,306
I need to eat some grass.

224
00:09:51,384 --> 00:09:52,696
Ew!

225
00:09:52,728 --> 00:09:54,634
That's Grandma's cake.

226
00:09:54,673 --> 00:09:56,859
Yuck!
Come on, Shadow.

227
00:09:58,384 --> 00:10:00,446
<i>I learned an important lesson that day.</i>

228
00:10:00,485 --> 00:10:03,103
<i>Cake and polyester don't mix.</i>

229
00:10:03,431 --> 00:10:06,595
<i>You know, I was actually starting to like
doing things with the whole family.</i>

230
00:10:06,624 --> 00:10:09,274
<i>They weren't so bad,
for people.</i>

231
00:10:09,794 --> 00:10:11,759
<i>They were all so happy together.</i>

232
00:10:11,892 --> 00:10:14,548
<i>And Shadow, and even Sassy,
seemed happy.</i>

233
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,821
<i>I was beginning to think
that maybe this time...</i>

234
00:10:16,876 --> 00:10:19,407
<i>with this family,
things were gonna be different...</i>

235
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:20,650
<i>better.</i>

236
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,493
Ta-da! Bat dog!

237
00:10:46,305 --> 00:10:48,445
Well, if it isn't the newlyweds!

238
00:10:48,492 --> 00:10:50,383
Hi, kids.

239
00:10:50,687 --> 00:10:52,094
- Hi.
- Hi.

240
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:53,766
Oh. How was the wedding?

241
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:54,812
Excuse me. Pardon me.

242
00:10:54,844 --> 00:10:56,773
Look out. Coming through.
Look out.

243
00:10:56,844 --> 00:10:59,242
Whoa, this place is a smellorama.

244
00:10:59,321 --> 00:11:02,441
Hallelujah!
I've died and gone to Kentucky!

245
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:06,995
- Wish I could've made it.
- We wish you could've been there.

246
00:11:07,058 --> 00:11:09,636
- Hey, you! Congratulations!
- Thanks.

247
00:11:11,105 --> 00:11:13,464
I don't know how to thank you
enough for what you're doing.

248
00:11:13,495 --> 00:11:15,355
Oh, are you kidding?
The more the merrier.

249
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,853
I just have to take that one short trip
that I told you about.

250
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,021
You're going away?

251
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,888
Oh, Peter, I help drive the horses
to winter grazing every year.

252
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:23,224
Just for a couple of days.

253
00:11:23,271 --> 00:11:24,997
Well, who's gonna take care of Shadow and--

254
00:11:25,022 --> 00:11:27,685
Oh, my neighbor, Frank. He always
watches the animals while I'm gone.

255
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,919
Don't worry.
He's very trustworthy.

256
00:11:30,537 --> 00:11:32,294
Do you have a minute to come in?

257
00:11:32,341 --> 00:11:34,247
I wish we could,
but we got a long way to go.

258
00:11:34,272 --> 00:11:35,561
Come on, Shadow.

259
00:11:35,663 --> 00:11:38,185
Chance. Come here, boy.
Chance.

260
00:11:40,828 --> 00:11:43,110
This is Miss Kate, Sassy.

261
00:11:43,219 --> 00:11:46,695
She's a nice lady and
she'll take good care of you.

262
00:11:47,195 --> 00:11:48,281
Won't you?

263
00:11:48,337 --> 00:11:49,743
Yes, ma'am.

264
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,658
Chance! Come here, boy!

265
00:11:55,692 --> 00:11:57,749
Chance!

266
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,109
Hey, gimme that Frisbee!

267
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:07,742
Be a good boy, Chance.

268
00:12:07,781 --> 00:12:10,749
- How far can you throw that Frisbee?
- Pretty far.

269
00:12:10,804 --> 00:12:12,619
Can you throw as far as
that field over there?

270
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,916
Maybe, you better do it.

271
00:12:18,744 --> 00:12:20,525
Hey! Hey!

272
00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:21,703
Hey!

273
00:12:21,728 --> 00:12:23,017
Hey!

274
00:12:23,088 --> 00:12:24,689
Oh now, look what you did.

275
00:12:24,752 --> 00:12:26,978
You let it escape.

276
00:12:28,751 --> 00:12:30,970
Don't worry.
I'll wrestle it to the ground

277
00:12:30,995 --> 00:12:34,048
and I chew it up so good
it'll never fly away again.

278
00:12:35,531 --> 00:12:38,245
I hope he doesn't forget me.

279
00:12:40,466 --> 00:12:42,346
Okay.

280
00:12:47,164 --> 00:12:49,328
I'm gonna miss you so much.

281
00:12:49,547 --> 00:12:50,734
I know.

282
00:12:50,777 --> 00:12:52,437
I know you're sad.

283
00:12:52,499 --> 00:12:54,406
I wish I knew why.

284
00:12:54,585 --> 00:12:57,843
We'll be back to visit next week,
okay? I promise.

285
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,562
What's wrong?

286
00:13:00,811 --> 00:13:02,492
Peter!

287
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,242
It's time!

288
00:13:06,162 --> 00:13:07,678
Don't worry, Peter.

289
00:13:07,733 --> 00:13:09,623
I'm here to protect you.

290
00:13:10,622 --> 00:13:12,280
Be a good dog.

291
00:13:13,545 --> 00:13:15,155
Stay.

292
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,248
Stay?

293
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,018
Hope, where are you going?

294
00:13:22,043 --> 00:13:23,509
Good-bye, Hope.
Bye-bye.

295
00:13:23,534 --> 00:13:26,346
All right, all right, all right.
Easy on the fur coat.

296
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,229
I got it! I got it!

297
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,354
Boy, it was crafty, all right, but I--

298
00:13:30,417 --> 00:13:31,830
Jamie?

299
00:13:32,252 --> 00:13:33,674
Jamie?

300
00:13:34,049 --> 00:13:35,487
Peter.

301
00:13:35,901 --> 00:13:37,424
Wait.

302
00:13:38,705 --> 00:13:40,143
Stay.

303
00:13:50,436 --> 00:13:52,034
Oh, no.

304
00:13:52,128 --> 00:13:53,885
Not this.

305
00:13:57,735 --> 00:13:59,760
Shadow? Chance?

306
00:13:59,862 --> 00:14:01,761
Come on, fellas.

307
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:04,573
Come on.

308
00:14:14,172 --> 00:14:15,578
Oh, come on, guys.

309
00:14:15,618 --> 00:14:18,469
We're gonna be back
for a visit in a couple weeks.

310
00:14:18,789 --> 00:14:20,836
I thought we'd be back next week.

311
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:23,328
Yeah, Mom. I told Shadow
I'd see him next weekend.

312
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,288
Oh, honey,
they don't know the difference.

313
00:14:25,313 --> 00:14:26,335
Yes, they will.

314
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,515
You know we can't
come back every weekend.

315
00:14:28,546 --> 00:14:30,062
Okay, two weeks then.

316
00:14:30,087 --> 00:14:32,070
It can't be any longer, okay?

317
00:14:32,156 --> 00:14:34,491
Okay. Two weeks.
It's a deal.

318
00:14:34,553 --> 00:14:36,054
Cross your heart?

319
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,796
Cross my heart.

320
00:14:38,484 --> 00:14:41,038
I just don't understand.

321
00:14:41,116 --> 00:14:44,148
Who are you gonna get
to watch over you?

322
00:14:44,359 --> 00:14:48,101
Who's gonna wait for you
to come home from school?

323
00:14:48,289 --> 00:14:51,312
Who's gonna sleep
at the foot of your bed?

324
00:14:51,895 --> 00:14:54,018
You'll come back.

325
00:14:54,246 --> 00:14:57,528
I know, you'll come back.

326
00:15:06,542 --> 00:15:07,800
Chance!

327
00:15:07,901 --> 00:15:10,018
Come on, boy!
Come and get it!

328
00:15:10,112 --> 00:15:12,487
Hey, Shadow, come on.
Breakfast time.

329
00:15:12,543 --> 00:15:14,128
Come on, boy.

330
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:15,511
Come on. That's a boy.

331
00:15:15,542 --> 00:15:19,878
Hey, which of you guys are regular
and which are extra-crispy?

332
00:15:24,964 --> 00:15:26,832
Hey, I know that noise.

333
00:15:27,036 --> 00:15:28,043
Kibble.

334
00:15:28,091 --> 00:15:29,981
Come on.
Breakfast time.

335
00:15:30,006 --> 00:15:31,925
Kibble, kibble, kibble,
kibble, kibble, kibble.

336
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,262
- Gimme, gimme kibble.
- No, no, no! No, no, no, sit down.

337
00:15:33,287 --> 00:15:34,996
- Gimme kibble. Kibble, kibble, kibble,
- Get down, Chance.

338
00:15:35,036 --> 00:15:37,457
- Kibble, kibble, kibble, kibble--
- No! Ow! Ow! Chance!

339
00:15:37,489 --> 00:15:39,475
Mm, where, where, where's kibble?
Where's kibble?

340
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:41,678
There you go.
Here you go, Chance.

341
00:15:43,491 --> 00:15:46,468
Oh, Sassy, I'm sorry!

342
00:15:46,538 --> 00:15:50,155
- Oh, my beautiful tail!
- Sorry, baby.

343
00:15:50,194 --> 00:15:52,210
Okay, look,
here's your breakfast.

344
00:15:52,241 --> 00:15:54,264
See? Here we go.

345
00:15:54,306 --> 00:15:56,022
All right, it's your turn.

346
00:15:56,061 --> 00:15:57,241
Okay.

347
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,018
You're supposed to warm it up.

348
00:15:59,089 --> 00:16:01,691
Oh, come on, girl.
I'm so sorry.

349
00:16:01,716 --> 00:16:03,339
- Come on.
- It's cold.

350
00:16:03,394 --> 00:16:04,760
Okay, come on.

351
00:16:04,948 --> 00:16:07,479
Well, don't expect a big tip from me.

352
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:14,630
I feel I'm going to be sick.

353
00:16:15,661 --> 00:16:17,411
Hey, hey, stop!

354
00:16:17,451 --> 00:16:19,107
That's mine!

355
00:16:20,286 --> 00:16:22,508
Yeah, well, you snooze, you lose.

356
00:16:23,187 --> 00:16:25,300
Ooh! Canines!

357
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:29,222
Whoa!
You're sick or what?

358
00:16:29,331 --> 00:16:30,863
Hey, bath toys!

359
00:16:31,011 --> 00:16:32,855
Oh, oh!
That's cold! Oh!

360
00:16:32,996 --> 00:16:34,511
Come on, come on.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

361
00:16:34,558 --> 00:16:36,472
I just wanna chew on your neck.

362
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:38,894
Whoa! What was that?

363
00:16:40,587 --> 00:16:42,712
Whoa! What a pig!

364
00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:45,212
Hey, what happened to your fur?

365
00:16:45,555 --> 00:16:48,190
Uh, excuse me, excuse me,
but I'm the new chicken monitor here.

366
00:16:48,236 --> 00:16:51,276
Hey, you gotta fix this dog door.
It's a little small. Ah!

367
00:16:51,322 --> 00:16:54,080
I'm afraid I may have left
a very important bone here.

368
00:16:54,105 --> 00:16:56,598
And uh, here we go.
He-haw! Look out!

369
00:16:56,669 --> 00:16:58,247
Ho, ho-ho, ho.

370
00:16:58,293 --> 00:16:59,707
I got you, I got you.

371
00:16:59,755 --> 00:17:00,965
Whoa!

372
00:17:01,012 --> 00:17:02,348
Whoa!

373
00:17:02,741 --> 00:17:04,981
Whoa! What the--!

374
00:17:05,793 --> 00:17:07,934
Help! It's Birdzilla!

375
00:17:07,981 --> 00:17:11,155
I swear I'll never eat
a McNugget again!

376
00:17:18,489 --> 00:17:21,983
You guys won't believe some of
the weird stuff they got around here.

377
00:17:22,056 --> 00:17:24,623
They got this bird
the size of a Rottweiler.

378
00:17:24,663 --> 00:17:27,233
Looks like somebody ran over his head.

379
00:17:28,315 --> 00:17:31,385
Oh, old man, what are you waiting for?
They're not coming back.

380
00:17:31,432 --> 00:17:33,494
That just shows you
how little you know.

381
00:17:33,533 --> 00:17:35,754
Look, it, it's happened before, to me.

382
00:17:35,793 --> 00:17:37,739
People use you and lose you.

383
00:17:37,769 --> 00:17:40,082
Shame on you for betraying your boy.

384
00:17:40,121 --> 00:17:41,480
Me betray him?

385
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:42,965
Ah, who ditched who?

386
00:17:42,996 --> 00:17:44,373
I mean, not that I care.

387
00:17:44,428 --> 00:17:46,530
I can get along just fine without him.

388
00:17:46,568 --> 00:17:48,881
How dare you call yourself a dog.

389
00:17:48,936 --> 00:17:50,436
A cat would know better.

390
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:54,834
Dogs are supposed to be faithful,
loyal and true.

391
00:17:55,756 --> 00:17:58,021
Oh, to people? Why?

392
00:17:58,068 --> 00:18:02,154
Didn't you even notice how sad
Jamie looked when he left?

393
00:18:02,326 --> 00:18:04,523
Sheesh! I'm sorry.

394
00:18:05,015 --> 00:18:07,828
Man, I didn't know anybody cared so much.

395
00:18:15,444 --> 00:18:17,045
Ask her about Chance.

396
00:18:17,085 --> 00:18:19,257
- And Sassy.
- They're doing just fine.

397
00:18:19,311 --> 00:18:20,460
Let me talk to Shadow.

398
00:18:20,507 --> 00:18:22,381
Peter wants to talk to Shadow.

399
00:18:22,499 --> 00:18:25,858
Peter, somebody here
wants to say hello to you.

400
00:18:26,999 --> 00:18:28,428
Shadow.

401
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:29,569
Shadow?

402
00:18:29,615 --> 00:18:30,834
Can you hear me, boy?

403
00:18:30,905 --> 00:18:32,967
Look, I know I promised
we'd be back tomorrow,

404
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,475
but we can't make it
for another week, okay?

405
00:18:35,545 --> 00:18:38,592
I never understand a thing
when they do this.

406
00:18:38,646 --> 00:18:39,906
Me neither.

407
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:41,781
But, you might as well humor them.

408
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,789
Did you hear that?
He said hello.

409
00:18:46,703 --> 00:18:48,796
What'd he say?
What'd he say?

410
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:51,757
He said Chance ate Sassy.

411
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,890
Nah, I'm just kidding.
He said Sassy loves it there.

412
00:18:57,132 --> 00:18:58,500
You know?

413
00:18:58,617 --> 00:19:00,811
I don't even miss the old place.

414
00:19:00,859 --> 00:19:02,921
I mean, there's a lot more stuff
to do here.

415
00:19:03,007 --> 00:19:04,851
Ugh! I miss it.

416
00:19:05,031 --> 00:19:06,546
It's so much harder for a...

417
00:19:06,617 --> 00:19:09,227
lady to keep clean here.

418
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,366
Thanks...

419
00:19:18,453 --> 00:19:20,194
again,

420
00:19:20,288 --> 00:19:21,819
Kate.

421
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,056
How much longer?

422
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:41,142
Peter should've been here by now.

423
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:42,970
Why don't you relax, Gramps?

424
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:44,924
Find yourself a shoe.

425
00:19:44,978 --> 00:19:46,900
No, pups.

426
00:19:46,963 --> 00:19:49,049
Do you have any idea
where that's been?

427
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:50,111
Oh, yeah.

428
00:19:50,158 --> 00:19:51,877
That's why I love it.
You want some?

429
00:19:51,915 --> 00:19:54,033
I'm not into leather.

430
00:19:55,102 --> 00:19:56,735
Now, where's she going?

431
00:19:56,931 --> 00:19:58,000
Huh?

432
00:19:58,086 --> 00:20:00,516
Okay, you guys.
I'll be back in a couple of days.

433
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:02,878
A car ride!
We're going on a car ride!

434
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,808
Let's go! All right!

435
00:20:04,902 --> 00:20:06,026
Ow!

436
00:20:06,378 --> 00:20:07,456
No, no, no. Sorry, boy.

437
00:20:07,487 --> 00:20:09,222
Not this time.
You stay here and be good.

438
00:20:09,261 --> 00:20:10,542
Okay? Bye-bye.

439
00:20:10,612 --> 00:20:12,089
Frank will be by to feed you later.

440
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:13,456
Something's happening.

441
00:20:13,597 --> 00:20:15,251
What?
What do you think it is?

442
00:20:15,276 --> 00:20:16,526
I don't know.

443
00:20:16,636 --> 00:20:18,175
But, I don't like it.

444
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:25,592
That's peculiar.

445
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:31,061
We're locked in.

446
00:20:31,264 --> 00:20:33,272
I hate being locked in.

447
00:20:33,373 --> 00:20:35,192
This is just like it was
back at the pound.

448
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,912
- Chance, calm down.
- You don't get it, do you?

449
00:20:37,967 --> 00:20:40,767
The pound is where humans lock you up
when they don't want you anymore.

450
00:20:40,811 --> 00:20:43,240
Not want me? Impossible.

451
00:20:43,311 --> 00:20:44,717
Don't listen to him.

452
00:20:44,748 --> 00:20:47,287
- He's just making it up to scare you.
- Oh, yeah?

453
00:20:47,342 --> 00:20:49,975
Well, you two pampered pets haven't
been out on the streets like I have.

454
00:20:50,006 --> 00:20:53,201
I've been to the pound, remember?
Don't tell me there's no pound.

455
00:20:54,056 --> 00:20:55,758
I know about the pound.

456
00:20:56,609 --> 00:20:58,500
Something doesn't smell right.

457
00:20:58,556 --> 00:21:00,829
They've been gone way too long.

458
00:21:00,904 --> 00:21:02,891
Much longer than they should've been.

459
00:21:02,978 --> 00:21:04,587
Something's really wrong.

460
00:21:04,618 --> 00:21:06,993
Wake up and smell the kibble.
They dumped us.

461
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:08,469
No, it isn't true!

462
00:21:08,516 --> 00:21:09,883
They love you and they dump you.

463
00:21:09,946 --> 00:21:11,399
Not Peter!

464
00:21:11,454 --> 00:21:13,097
You could be right, Shadow.
It's...

465
00:21:13,191 --> 00:21:15,745
It's been too much time,
way too much time.

466
00:21:15,784 --> 00:21:18,144
Something is keeping Peter
from coming to me.

467
00:21:18,199 --> 00:21:19,675
So, I'm gonna go to him.

468
00:21:19,706 --> 00:21:22,544
You guys kill me.
She locked the gate, remember?

469
00:21:22,591 --> 00:21:24,739
I don't care about gates.

470
00:21:26,113 --> 00:21:27,856
I'm going home.

471
00:21:28,282 --> 00:21:29,334
What?

472
00:21:29,397 --> 00:21:30,795
What'd he say?

473
00:21:34,568 --> 00:21:35,920
No way.

474
00:21:36,006 --> 00:21:37,178
Shadow, wait!

475
00:21:37,224 --> 00:21:38,974
It's, it's too far.

476
00:21:39,108 --> 00:21:40,834
You don't know the way.

477
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:43,419
And what if they come
back here looking for us?

478
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:44,919
It's time to go, Sassy.

479
00:21:44,966 --> 00:21:46,185
I'm going home.

480
00:21:46,232 --> 00:21:47,779
Oh, it's crazy!

481
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:49,255
Who'll feed you?

482
00:21:49,302 --> 00:21:51,038
You won't make it
out there on the road!

483
00:21:51,078 --> 00:21:53,648
That's where they catch you
and take you to the pound!

484
00:21:53,702 --> 00:21:55,437
I'm staying' right here.

485
00:21:55,531 --> 00:21:56,663
Huh?

486
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:58,859
Whoa! Birdzilla returns!

487
00:21:58,913 --> 00:22:01,517
Hey, guys, guys, wait up!
Wait up! I'm coming!

488
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:04,267
Oh, don't let him eat me.
Don't let him eat me.

489
00:22:04,346 --> 00:22:06,759
Oh! Oh, oh!

490
00:22:06,806 --> 00:22:08,751
Ah! Oh! Ugh!

491
00:22:09,731 --> 00:22:13,035
Whoa! Ugh! Ow!
Did that hurt.

492
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:15,964
Look out, chicken broads.
Coming through!

493
00:22:16,066 --> 00:22:17,574
Pardon me.

494
00:22:26,795 --> 00:22:28,576
Home is just over that mountain.

495
00:22:28,632 --> 00:22:30,178
We'll be there before dark.

496
00:22:30,217 --> 00:22:31,592
How do you figure?

497
00:22:31,671 --> 00:22:33,452
It took us ages to get this far.

498
00:22:33,475 --> 00:22:34,928
That was the long way.

499
00:22:34,991 --> 00:22:37,365
We'll take the shortcut,
straight up and over.

500
00:22:37,475 --> 00:22:38,788
Hey!

501
00:22:39,045 --> 00:22:40,342
Wait up!

502
00:22:40,428 --> 00:22:42,202
Hey, guys, wait up!

503
00:22:42,311 --> 00:22:43,326
Here I am.

504
00:22:43,358 --> 00:22:45,335
I thought you were gonna stay, pup.

505
00:22:45,389 --> 00:22:48,420
Yeah, well, I thought I better come along
in case you two needed protection.

506
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:50,194
My hero.

507
00:22:50,264 --> 00:22:52,928
Guess I'm gonna have to stare at
your butt the whole way.

508
00:22:53,951 --> 00:22:56,061
I'll race you to the trees.

509
00:22:56,631 --> 00:23:00,490
<i>And so began the most
perilous journey of our lives.</i>

510
00:23:01,902 --> 00:23:06,362
The Sierras extend to over 250 miles,
north and south...

511
00:23:06,456 --> 00:23:08,995
and to over 50 miles,
east and west.

512
00:23:09,034 --> 00:23:12,081
Now, this makes them the second
largest mountain range

513
00:23:12,112 --> 00:23:14,583
in the Western United States.

514
00:23:18,335 --> 00:23:20,437
Oh, I broke a nail.
I broke a nail.

515
00:23:20,468 --> 00:23:22,250
Not much further now.

516
00:23:22,304 --> 00:23:25,522
I think, maybe, Little Miss Fur Ball
needs a rest, don't you think?

517
00:23:25,554 --> 00:23:26,718
What's the matter, pup?

518
00:23:26,757 --> 00:23:28,976
Too much for a tough guy like you?

519
00:23:29,001 --> 00:23:31,948
Uh, what are you talking about?
I'm just sick of hearing her whine.

520
00:23:31,986 --> 00:23:33,142
Eeh, oh!

521
00:23:33,191 --> 00:23:35,353
This ground isn't nearly soft enough.

522
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,478
Ah, ah!

523
00:23:36,509 --> 00:23:38,384
Almost there, Sassy.

524
00:23:38,432 --> 00:23:41,415
I hate these package tours.

525
00:23:47,164 --> 00:23:48,516
Here, dogs!

526
00:23:48,587 --> 00:23:50,031
Come on.

527
00:23:55,431 --> 00:23:56,536
Kitty?

528
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:58,208
Here, kitty, kitty.

529
00:24:01,158 --> 00:24:02,779
That's funny.

530
00:24:12,505 --> 00:24:14,740
"Thanks for feeding them--

531
00:24:15,057 --> 00:24:19,739
Old dog seems really homesick.
So, taking him and the other two--''

532
00:24:22,245 --> 00:24:23,998
Taking 'em where?

533
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,688
Cat on a stock drive?
You gotta be kidding me.

534
00:24:28,422 --> 00:24:30,290
Okay, okay.
I know you're hungry.

535
00:24:30,321 --> 00:24:31,665
I'm coming.

536
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:34,673
Ah, oh, I wanna be home...

537
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,265
where the tallest thing
I have to climb is a bookshelf.

538
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:38,401
Top's just ahead.

539
00:24:38,426 --> 00:24:40,433
You'll be able to see
our house from there.

540
00:24:40,464 --> 00:24:41,655
Keep marching.

541
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,831
Don't worry.

542
00:24:42,878 --> 00:24:45,300
I'm gonna be glad
to put this place behind me.

543
00:24:45,374 --> 00:24:48,241
First of all, there's way
too many new smells to learn.

544
00:24:48,292 --> 00:24:50,776
Not to mention, I got about
ten million trees to mark,

545
00:24:50,801 --> 00:24:53,348
and I don't know about you,
but I am running on empty.

546
00:24:53,633 --> 00:24:55,175
Finally.

547
00:24:56,269 --> 00:24:58,706
Oh, Shadow.

548
00:24:59,011 --> 00:25:00,128
Whoa!

549
00:25:00,175 --> 00:25:02,011
Get a load of this.

550
00:25:08,887 --> 00:25:11,395
You could see everything from up here.

551
00:25:11,746 --> 00:25:13,520
Except the house.
I don't see the house.

552
00:25:13,551 --> 00:25:15,028
Where's the house, Shadow?

553
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:17,059
Well, thank you, Shadow.

554
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:19,809
It's been simply a divine vacation.

555
00:25:19,832 --> 00:25:23,186
But, I think I'll just stay here
and wait for the bus.

556
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:25,295
Okay.

557
00:25:25,716 --> 00:25:27,678
Hey, where you going?
Where's he going?

558
00:25:27,717 --> 00:25:29,319
- Shadow?
- I told you.

559
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,975
I'm going home.

560
00:25:31,053 --> 00:25:33,678
- You can't be serious.
- I have to go.

561
00:25:33,788 --> 00:25:35,327
Peter might be in trouble.

562
00:25:35,358 --> 00:25:37,342
Oh, would you look around.
We're in trouble.

563
00:25:37,374 --> 00:25:39,733
Home's not that way.
Can't you smell straight?

564
00:25:39,787 --> 00:25:42,187
Oh, it's out there.
I have a sixth sense.

565
00:25:42,235 --> 00:25:43,897
You'll have it... one day.

566
00:25:43,945 --> 00:25:46,100
Shadow, you're not as young
as you used to be.

567
00:25:46,125 --> 00:25:48,282
I'm going home, that's all.

568
00:25:48,352 --> 00:25:49,859
Now, you two coming or not?

569
00:25:49,891 --> 00:25:54,602
Look, there's no way I'm gonna let
an old-timer like you going alone.

570
00:25:54,633 --> 00:25:55,803
I'll be your guard dog.

571
00:25:55,828 --> 00:25:57,070
This isn't a game, pup.

572
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,437
If you're coming,
you're gonna have to keep up.

573
00:25:59,462 --> 00:26:00,961
All right.
Hey, don't worry about me.

574
00:26:00,986 --> 00:26:02,954
I got the stuff.
It's you I'm worried about.

575
00:26:02,984 --> 00:26:05,367
You two are really gonna
go off and leave me here?

576
00:26:05,392 --> 00:26:07,719
You wait for that bus.
You'll do fine.

577
00:26:07,758 --> 00:26:10,500
Yeah, well, I'll send you
a dead bird when we get there.

578
00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:12,867
I prefer to do my own shopping.

579
00:26:12,925 --> 00:26:14,432
Au revoir, Sassy.

580
00:26:14,464 --> 00:26:15,745
Hey!

581
00:26:15,776 --> 00:26:17,830
All right.
All right, wait up.

582
00:26:17,901 --> 00:26:18,924
Ooh!

583
00:26:18,955 --> 00:26:22,127
I can't believe I'm following
a couple of irresponsible,

584
00:26:22,158 --> 00:26:26,213
misguided, mangy canine
plague lifters.

585
00:26:26,401 --> 00:26:29,080
<i>There was more to that old boy
than I'd given him credit for.</i>

586
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:31,205
<i>I was soon to learn
just how much more.</i>

587
00:26:31,274 --> 00:26:34,346
But even in that moment,
I had to admire his faith...

588
00:26:34,479 --> 00:26:36,393
wherever it might lead us.

589
00:27:16,654 --> 00:27:17,709
Check it out.

590
00:27:17,741 --> 00:27:19,326
What kind of animal made that?

591
00:27:19,373 --> 00:27:21,428
That?
You don't wanna know.

592
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:22,615
Whoa!

593
00:27:22,678 --> 00:27:24,131
That's as big as Sassy.

594
00:27:24,164 --> 00:27:25,342
Thanks, darling.

595
00:27:25,405 --> 00:27:26,834
Whew!
But it smells better.

596
00:27:26,865 --> 00:27:29,640
At least I don't roll in it
like some species.

597
00:27:36,726 --> 00:27:38,414
Oh, right.
Like if you yap at it,

598
00:27:38,442 --> 00:27:40,140
it's gonna come right down
and ask you to eat it.

599
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,687
Huh! Pitiful!

600
00:27:44,364 --> 00:27:45,969
What's that smell?

601
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,969
That smells interesting.

602
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:57,180
Woo-hoo-hoo!

603
00:27:57,211 --> 00:27:59,297
I never thought anything
could smell too much.

604
00:27:59,343 --> 00:28:01,742
Hey, hey, Shadow!
Shadow, you wanna have some fun?

605
00:28:01,821 --> 00:28:03,797
Go stick your head in that hole.

606
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:06,328
Pace yourself, pup.
We got a long way to go.

607
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:09,461
Don't sweat it, pops!
I could go on like this for days!

608
00:28:12,168 --> 00:28:13,496
Oh...

609
00:28:13,536 --> 00:28:16,254
I'm too pooped to poop.

610
00:28:16,441 --> 00:28:17,996
Shh! Just sleep.

611
00:28:18,021 --> 00:28:20,723
I can't sleep.
Too tired to sleep.

612
00:28:20,777 --> 00:28:22,230
I'm tired and I'm hungry.

613
00:28:22,268 --> 00:28:24,660
And this place is spooky.
I don't like it here.

614
00:28:24,793 --> 00:28:26,207
Gives me the creeps.

615
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:28,863
Oh, fraidy cat.
I mean, dog.

616
00:28:28,902 --> 00:28:31,793
You two pipe down
and go to sleep.

617
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,504
Now what?

618
00:28:37,606 --> 00:28:39,129
There's something out there.

619
00:28:39,215 --> 00:28:41,238
Oooooh!

620
00:28:41,309 --> 00:28:44,200
Enough, Sassy.
Now, sleep.

621
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,949
I'm telling you guys.

622
00:28:46,019 --> 00:28:47,965
There's something out there.

623
00:29:05,091 --> 00:29:06,973
What was that?

624
00:29:07,513 --> 00:29:10,052
Uh, something's out there.

625
00:29:10,138 --> 00:29:11,498
What do I do?
What do I do?

626
00:29:11,539 --> 00:29:13,646
Stay right where you are.

627
00:29:13,724 --> 00:29:15,873
- What is it?
- A moose, probably.

628
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:17,958
Oh, a moose.

629
00:29:18,185 --> 00:29:21,185
- What's a moose?
- A big razor-toothed animal.

630
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:24,528
Comes out at night to eat
the tails off smaller animals.

631
00:29:24,817 --> 00:29:26,726
Yeow!
Uh, uh, uh, don't worry.

632
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,086
I'll, I'll, I'll protect you.

633
00:29:28,117 --> 00:29:30,257
Of course, mooses can't climb trees.

634
00:29:30,296 --> 00:29:32,672
Don't have to.
They can reach right up to the top.

635
00:29:32,726 --> 00:29:34,312
You'll be safer on the ground with us.

636
00:29:34,343 --> 00:29:36,195
Me? Sassy?

637
00:29:36,297 --> 00:29:38,180
Sleep in the dirt?

638
00:29:50,285 --> 00:29:54,140
Well, look who's down
in the dirt with the dogs.

639
00:29:54,295 --> 00:29:55,929
Morning, honey.

640
00:29:56,147 --> 00:29:57,273
Ugh!

641
00:29:57,319 --> 00:29:59,007
Dog breath!
Blech!

642
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:02,038
Up and at 'em, you two,
I've found our breakfast.

643
00:30:02,087 --> 00:30:03,741
Great. I hope it's garbage.

644
00:30:03,781 --> 00:30:05,242
No. Even better.

645
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,757
With you two gourmets,
I can just imagine.

646
00:30:07,796 --> 00:30:09,108
Fine!
Stay here and diet.

647
00:30:09,156 --> 00:30:10,257
Are you calling me fat?

648
00:30:10,288 --> 00:30:12,999
Of course not,
for a hippopotamus.

649
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:16,806
- I meant to do that.
- Ha, ha! Serves you right.

650
00:30:18,999 --> 00:30:21,126
This?
No, wait, wait, this one.

651
00:30:21,181 --> 00:30:22,532
Wait! Shadow?

652
00:30:22,564 --> 00:30:23,886
How'd you get one of these?

653
00:30:23,926 --> 00:30:25,145
Sassy.

654
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,347
Oh. Wait, there--

655
00:30:27,472 --> 00:30:29,628
Sassy, help me out here, will you?
I'm starving.

656
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,988
Say it first.

657
00:30:31,058 --> 00:30:33,248
- Oh, ah--
- Say it.

658
00:30:33,529 --> 00:30:36,373
Okay. Cats rule
and dogs drool.

659
00:30:36,427 --> 00:30:38,427
I can't hear you.

660
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:40,982
Cats rule and dogs drool!
You happy?

661
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,998
Thank you, precious.

662
00:30:43,045 --> 00:30:45,053
You're welcome, cupcake.

663
00:30:45,115 --> 00:30:48,263
La, la, la-la-la
Woo!

664
00:30:48,288 --> 00:30:50,076
- There you go.
- Hey, thanks.

665
00:30:50,107 --> 00:30:51,615
Oh! Whoa, fish!

666
00:30:51,701 --> 00:30:53,177
Sit.
Hey, fish!

667
00:30:53,208 --> 00:30:54,238
Whoa.

668
00:30:54,263 --> 00:30:55,998
Whoa, here you go.
Stop! Sit!

669
00:30:56,044 --> 00:30:58,537
Sit! Stay, fish!
Stay! Roll over!

670
00:30:58,583 --> 00:30:59,708
Whoa.

671
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:02,130
Hey, hey, hey, hey, scram!
Get your own fish.

672
00:31:02,162 --> 00:31:03,631
Careful, pup.

673
00:31:03,701 --> 00:31:05,771
No, no, we didn't invite these guys.

674
00:31:05,804 --> 00:31:07,115
Hey, get outta here.
Get outta here.

675
00:31:07,146 --> 00:31:08,670
Buzz off, you party crashers.

676
00:31:08,695 --> 00:31:10,419
Go steal some porridge.

677
00:31:12,013 --> 00:31:13,576
Chance.

678
00:31:20,898 --> 00:31:22,679
You guys catch that?

679
00:31:22,843 --> 00:31:24,163
I smoked them.

680
00:31:24,218 --> 00:31:26,351
I wouldn't be so cocky, Chance.

681
00:31:26,429 --> 00:31:28,319
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, time out.

682
00:31:28,366 --> 00:31:30,530
Look, when Chance scares somebody off...

683
00:31:30,569 --> 00:31:33,046
- they be gone.
- Uh, Chance.

684
00:31:33,085 --> 00:31:34,179
Lousy punks.

685
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:36,429
Think cos they're bigger than me,
they can steal my fish?

686
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,171
- Well, they ain't even that big.
- Chance!

687
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:39,515
Get away from there.

688
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:42,694
What is... this?

689
00:31:42,757 --> 00:31:44,288
Uh, gosh, you look hungry.

690
00:31:44,328 --> 00:31:47,233
Uh, may I recommend the trout?

691
00:32:04,855 --> 00:32:09,659
Well, looks like we don't have any choice,
but to go straight across.

692
00:32:10,722 --> 00:32:12,519
Chance, when will you grow up?

693
00:32:12,582 --> 00:32:14,113
That bear could've eaten you.

694
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,752
Do you realize how painful
that would've been...

695
00:32:16,807 --> 00:32:19,784
- for the bear?
- Oh, go hawk up a hair ball.

696
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:21,846
Oh, yeah, that hurt.
Ooh!

697
00:32:21,877 --> 00:32:23,887
- Really hurt!
- Sassy, Chance...

698
00:32:23,926 --> 00:32:26,176
I'm sorry, but we're gonna
have to cross here.

699
00:32:26,231 --> 00:32:28,543
- But, there isn't a bridge here.
- Come on.

700
00:32:28,582 --> 00:32:30,473
I don't see any stepping-stones.

701
00:32:30,536 --> 00:32:32,075
Hey, wait up.

702
00:32:33,488 --> 00:32:36,684
It's gentle here, Sassy.
You could swim across.

703
00:32:36,731 --> 00:32:39,035
I don't have to swim.
I have a note.

704
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,637
It's fun to swim.

705
00:32:40,731 --> 00:32:42,637
Come on, you'll like it.

706
00:32:42,754 --> 00:32:45,012
Except for the water part.

707
00:32:46,277 --> 00:32:48,098
Come on, you two.

708
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,098
Don't be such a sissy, Sassy.

709
00:32:50,153 --> 00:32:51,682
You know how to swim?

710
00:32:51,707 --> 00:32:53,965
I happen to be
a champion dog paddler.

711
00:32:54,051 --> 00:32:56,770
Banzai!
Oh, that's cold!

712
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,434
- Oh, that's cold.
- It's easy, Sassy.

713
00:32:59,489 --> 00:33:02,169
- It's cold!
- I prefer the dry look.

714
00:33:10,551 --> 00:33:13,364
I think I shrank in there.

715
00:33:14,871 --> 00:33:19,371
Please, don't make that noise, Sassy.
I'll come back and swim beside you.

716
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:21,950
Oh, don't bother.
I'll find my own way across.

717
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:24,137
The water just gets worse further down.

718
00:33:24,165 --> 00:33:26,129
Where is she--?
Sassy!

719
00:33:26,244 --> 00:33:28,473
I can't believe what
they want me to do.

720
00:33:28,575 --> 00:33:30,926
Just so they can have
the pleasure of my company?

721
00:33:30,972 --> 00:33:32,950
She just doesn't want to get wet.

722
00:33:33,098 --> 00:33:34,465
She can swim, she can.

723
00:33:34,494 --> 00:33:35,512
She won't.

724
00:33:35,543 --> 00:33:37,614
She won't, she won't, she won't.

725
00:33:37,987 --> 00:33:40,418
She won't, she won't,
she won't, she won't, she won't.

726
00:33:40,473 --> 00:33:42,028
She won't.

727
00:33:42,215 --> 00:33:44,700
Ah, this is more like it.

728
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:48,395
I'm so clever, I amaze myself.

729
00:33:50,151 --> 00:33:51,915
Will you look at that?

730
00:33:51,962 --> 00:33:53,665
Cats rule and dogs drool.

731
00:33:53,704 --> 00:33:54,767
- Jumping rocks.
- Cats rule...

732
00:33:54,792 --> 00:33:55,992
- Typical cat move.
- dogs drool.

733
00:33:56,017 --> 00:33:57,462
Good girl, Sassy.

734
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:58,876
- You all right?
- Never better.

735
00:33:58,955 --> 00:34:00,235
Never better.

736
00:34:00,274 --> 00:34:01,657
Ooh ooh ooh!

737
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,814
Ahh! Yes!

738
00:34:02,854 --> 00:34:04,673
Well, good work.

739
00:34:05,516 --> 00:34:07,360
Aah! Oh! Oh!

740
00:34:07,362 --> 00:34:09,407
I just had this coat cleaned.

741
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:11,173
- Sassy?
- Oh, help!

742
00:34:11,212 --> 00:34:14,081
- Help! Shadow!
- Sassy's in the river, Chance.

743
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:15,254
Shadow!

744
00:34:15,301 --> 00:34:17,394
Ugh! Oh! No!

745
00:34:17,447 --> 00:34:18,738
Oh!

746
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:21,284
Oh.

747
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:27,135
Hang on, Sassy!

748
00:34:31,963 --> 00:34:33,346
Sassy!

749
00:34:38,283 --> 00:34:39,789
Sassy, I'm coming!

750
00:34:39,836 --> 00:34:41,312
Keep your head above water!

751
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:43,009
Oh, Shadow--

752
00:34:46,028 --> 00:34:48,132
Sha-- Shadow, how about you?

753
00:34:51,242 --> 00:34:52,522
Help!

754
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,444
Help me! Shadow!

755
00:35:00,434 --> 00:35:01,850
Shadow, please!

756
00:35:01,906 --> 00:35:04,741
- Sassy, swim, swim hard.
- Please!

757
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,452
Help!

758
00:35:08,047 --> 00:35:10,030
Sassy! Sassy!

759
00:35:10,093 --> 00:35:12,553
Shadow-ohh!

760
00:35:19,174 --> 00:35:21,049
Oh, no.

761
00:35:28,921 --> 00:35:30,881
Did you find her?
Where is she?

762
00:35:30,954 --> 00:35:34,342
I couldn't reach her,
but we've got to keep trying.

763
00:35:34,476 --> 00:35:35,647
Hurry!

764
00:35:36,014 --> 00:35:38,655
Maybe she made it to the other side.

765
00:35:52,993 --> 00:35:55,550
I, I don't see her,
Shadow, do you?

766
00:35:55,933 --> 00:35:56,972
No.

767
00:35:57,010 --> 00:35:58,948
It swallowed her up.

768
00:36:45,383 --> 00:36:48,135
I shouldn't have made her come.

769
00:36:48,232 --> 00:36:49,909
It's not your fault.

770
00:36:50,033 --> 00:36:51,713
She wanted to come.

771
00:36:51,781 --> 00:36:54,190
But, it's my responsibility.

772
00:36:54,392 --> 00:36:57,327
I had a responsibility to Sassy.

773
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:58,776
To love her...

774
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,346
and protect her.

775
00:37:00,525 --> 00:37:03,245
The same as I have to you...

776
00:37:03,829 --> 00:37:05,456
and to Peter.

777
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,026
And the same as you have...

778
00:37:08,261 --> 00:37:09,597
to Jamie.

779
00:37:09,784 --> 00:37:10,901
But...

780
00:37:10,971 --> 00:37:12,416
we didn't ask for this job.

781
00:37:12,464 --> 00:37:13,792
We didn't have to.

782
00:37:13,862 --> 00:37:15,237
It's built in.

783
00:37:15,378 --> 00:37:18,002
Has been ever since the dawn of time...

784
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:21,518
when a few wild dogs
took it upon themselves...

785
00:37:21,565 --> 00:37:23,222
to watch over man.

786
00:37:23,511 --> 00:37:24,683
To bark...

787
00:37:24,745 --> 00:37:26,409
when he's in danger.

788
00:37:26,512 --> 00:37:28,354
To run and play with him...

789
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:29,886
when he's happy.

790
00:37:30,111 --> 00:37:31,416
To nuzzle him...

791
00:37:31,464 --> 00:37:33,127
when he's lonely.

792
00:37:33,862 --> 00:37:35,276
That's why...

793
00:37:35,362 --> 00:37:38,112
they call us: Man's best friend.

794
00:37:41,218 --> 00:37:43,048
<i>Looking at him that night,</i>

795
00:37:43,158 --> 00:37:45,189
<i>he seemed so wise...</i>

796
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:46,861
<i>and ancient...</i>

797
00:37:47,104 --> 00:37:50,087
<i>like the first dog
that ever walked the Earth.</i>

798
00:37:50,504 --> 00:37:52,572
<i>I just hope that one day,</i>

799
00:37:52,689 --> 00:37:54,447
<i>I can be like him.</i>

800
00:38:20,046 --> 00:38:22,644
I'll miss you, Sassy.

801
00:38:38,404 --> 00:38:40,451
There you are.

802
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:43,279
The master of the sky.

803
00:38:43,669 --> 00:38:45,724
You're the boss.

804
00:38:46,716 --> 00:38:48,216
Well, now.

805
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:51,927
Third sighting in...

806
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:54,216
four months.

807
00:38:54,272 --> 00:38:55,818
Not bad.

808
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,865
Not bad at all.

809
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,029
What's that?

810
00:39:07,393 --> 00:39:09,307
You poor thing.

811
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:12,721
How did you get
way out here?

812
00:39:13,206 --> 00:39:14,627
Lemme see.

813
00:39:16,901 --> 00:39:18,533
You're alive?

814
00:39:26,128 --> 00:39:27,714
Yeah, that-a-girl.

815
00:39:27,797 --> 00:39:30,198
Get you all cleaned up here now.

816
00:39:30,347 --> 00:39:32,412
- Yeah.
- Shadow?

817
00:39:32,458 --> 00:39:36,943
What's a classy dame like you
doing way out here in the sticks?

818
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:40,419
- Shadow.
- Some rest...

819
00:39:40,512 --> 00:39:42,451
- Chance?
- some food...

820
00:39:42,631 --> 00:39:43,646
Shadow?

821
00:39:43,708 --> 00:39:45,115
- Shadow.
- you'll be all right.

822
00:39:45,537 --> 00:39:46,544
Shadow.

823
00:39:49,534 --> 00:39:52,314
You'll never catch anything
if you're not patient.

824
00:39:52,353 --> 00:39:53,408
I can't help it.

825
00:39:53,454 --> 00:39:54,767
I'm starving.

826
00:39:55,327 --> 00:39:59,161
I'm starving too,
but you have to be patient.

827
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:01,345
Stop barking.

828
00:40:01,384 --> 00:40:03,650
You'll scare everything away.

829
00:40:04,661 --> 00:40:05,908
Don't move a muscle.

830
00:40:05,994 --> 00:40:07,127
I won't, I won't.

831
00:40:07,173 --> 00:40:09,141
- And don't heel.
- Okay.

832
00:40:09,181 --> 00:40:10,462
Wait till I say go.

833
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:11,822
- Say what?
- Go!

834
00:40:13,749 --> 00:40:15,783
No!

835
00:40:19,495 --> 00:40:21,513
There goes the bunny.

836
00:40:23,432 --> 00:40:25,724
There goes the pup.

837
00:40:26,315 --> 00:40:28,669
There goes breakfast.

838
00:40:28,873 --> 00:40:29,911
Uh!

839
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:31,700
I hate fast food.

840
00:40:31,772 --> 00:40:33,955
That's it, pup, you're on your own.

841
00:40:33,986 --> 00:40:35,854
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm, I'm sorry.
I'll do it right.

842
00:40:35,893 --> 00:40:37,221
Just give me a second chance.

843
00:40:37,264 --> 00:40:39,491
That was your second chance, Chance.

844
00:40:39,516 --> 00:40:40,869
Give me a third chance.
Come on.

845
00:40:40,893 --> 00:40:42,518
Please, I'm starving!

846
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:43,846
Good. All right.

847
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:45,456
One last time.

848
00:40:45,508 --> 00:40:47,346
Now, how did Sassy do this?

849
00:40:47,371 --> 00:40:48,510
I don't want it. I don't want it.

850
00:40:48,535 --> 00:40:50,854
I don't want it.
I-I-I-I don't want it!

851
00:40:50,893 --> 00:40:52,002
I don't want it.

852
00:40:52,041 --> 00:40:54,314
- Sassy'd love to see this.
- Uh!

853
00:40:54,415 --> 00:40:55,893
Ah.

854
00:41:02,766 --> 00:41:04,427
Shadow?

855
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,794
Chance?

856
00:41:06,865 --> 00:41:08,380
Sassy?

857
00:41:08,724 --> 00:41:10,239
Welcome home!

858
00:41:10,286 --> 00:41:12,286
- Hey!
- Been watching for you all morning.

859
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:13,224
How was it?

860
00:41:13,255 --> 00:41:15,294
Oh, boy, that trail gets longer every year.

861
00:41:15,325 --> 00:41:16,958
I need a nice soak in a hot tub.

862
00:41:16,997 --> 00:41:18,708
How'd the animals take to it?

863
00:41:18,802 --> 00:41:19,974
The horses?

864
00:41:20,024 --> 00:41:22,583
No, the dogs and cat.

865
00:41:23,157 --> 00:41:24,645
What?

866
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:26,474
You mean...

867
00:41:26,578 --> 00:41:28,903
you didn't take them with you?

868
00:41:29,224 --> 00:41:31,435
Freddie, you don't take pets
on a stock drive.

869
00:41:31,478 --> 00:41:34,871
Well, that's what I thought,
but your note said you'd taken them.

870
00:41:34,896 --> 00:41:36,651
Uh, no, ma'am.
I gotta tell you,

871
00:41:36,676 --> 00:41:39,292
domesticated animals wouldn't
stand a chance out here.

872
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:41,621
We've got bears, mountain lions.

873
00:41:41,683 --> 00:41:43,316
These are serious predators.

874
00:41:43,352 --> 00:41:46,613
Is there anybody else
in the Park Service I can call?

875
00:41:47,211 --> 00:41:50,300
Oh, would you?
Oh, I'd appreciate it.

876
00:41:51,021 --> 00:41:53,089
Oh, I gave you my number, didn't I?

877
00:41:53,238 --> 00:41:54,520
Oh, good.

878
00:41:54,614 --> 00:41:56,292
Yeah, it's just a shot.

879
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,621
Bye.

880
00:42:00,027 --> 00:42:02,661
You've done everything you can.

881
00:42:07,295 --> 00:42:09,345
Not everything.

882
00:42:16,839 --> 00:42:18,948
Well, maybe we can go look for them.

883
00:42:19,089 --> 00:42:20,566
Really?

884
00:42:20,803 --> 00:42:23,566
I really don't think we're gonna
be able to do that, guys.

885
00:42:23,616 --> 00:42:24,886
Why couldn't we?

886
00:42:24,933 --> 00:42:27,019
Look, Peter, we all miss them.

887
00:42:27,179 --> 00:42:29,768
We're gonna do everything
we can to find them.

888
00:42:29,972 --> 00:42:31,589
But, we have to be patient.

889
00:42:31,645 --> 00:42:33,347
We have to do something.

890
00:42:33,409 --> 00:42:34,683
Oh.

891
00:42:35,573 --> 00:42:38,847
Trying to find three animals
in the wilderness is like...

892
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:41,503
trying to find a needle in a haystack.

893
00:42:41,987 --> 00:42:43,316
I think we...

894
00:42:43,379 --> 00:42:45,418
need to be realistic.

895
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:46,909
I don't care what you think.

896
00:42:46,949 --> 00:42:48,754
I told you he'd think
I abandoned him.

897
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,121
But you made us come anyway.

898
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:52,362
It's your fault!
It's all your fault!

899
00:42:52,395 --> 00:42:53,847
Peter!

900
00:43:10,538 --> 00:43:11,604
Professor?

901
00:43:11,784 --> 00:43:13,760
- What?
- They're waiting for you.

902
00:43:13,846 --> 00:43:14,877
- Who?

903
00:43:14,914 --> 00:43:17,401
Dean Maxwell and the Grant Committee.

904
00:43:17,483 --> 00:43:19,377
Oh, I forgot.

905
00:43:24,409 --> 00:43:25,655
Print!

906
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:27,804
Print, you Stone Age piece of junk.

907
00:43:27,846 --> 00:43:30,757
- Professor.
- Yeah, yeah, okay, okay.

908
00:43:33,425 --> 00:43:34,858
Listen, um...

909
00:43:34,883 --> 00:43:37,413
could you do me a big favor, please?

910
00:43:37,452 --> 00:43:40,843
Have 50 of, uh, no.
100 of those printed up...

911
00:43:41,038 --> 00:43:42,577
as a personal favor to me.

912
00:43:42,609 --> 00:43:44,788
I'd really appreciate it.
Thanks.

913
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:51,476
Hungry, hungry, hungry.

914
00:43:51,523 --> 00:43:53,257
Hungry, hungry, hungry, hungry.

915
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:54,343
Again?

916
00:43:54,368 --> 00:43:56,726
First thing I wanna do when I get back
is raid the trash can.

917
00:43:56,773 --> 00:43:58,109
I just want to see Peter.

918
00:43:58,155 --> 00:44:03,624
Yep, straight into the garbage,
snout first, darn good eating.

919
00:44:12,793 --> 00:44:14,522
Oh, no.

920
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:16,444
I'm with strangers.

921
00:44:16,578 --> 00:44:20,506
And I look like something
the dog dragged in.

922
00:44:21,491 --> 00:44:22,999
Well.

923
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:24,475
You made it through the night.

924
00:44:24,516 --> 00:44:27,233
I guess that means
you're gonna be okay.

925
00:44:28,053 --> 00:44:30,787
You think you can keep some milk down?

926
00:44:33,681 --> 00:44:36,275
Was that my sixth life?

927
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,910
Oh, I'll just say it was my fourth.

928
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,908
Here you go.

929
00:44:42,197 --> 00:44:45,183
Nice, warm goat's milk.

930
00:44:45,358 --> 00:44:47,826
Compliments of Aretha.

931
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:50,933
Hey,

932
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:52,636
this isn't low fat.

933
00:44:52,738 --> 00:44:53,839
But,

934
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:56,322
uh, it is pretty good.

935
00:44:57,348 --> 00:45:00,198
- Remember hot dogs?
- Yeah.

936
00:45:00,276 --> 00:45:01,620
Never much liked the name.

937
00:45:01,671 --> 00:45:03,972
Well, I don't think
they're really made out of dog.

938
00:45:04,009 --> 00:45:05,784
I don't think they're made of meat.

939
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:08,034
They taste the best
when they fall in the dirt.

940
00:45:08,081 --> 00:45:10,167
Yeah.

941
00:45:20,025 --> 00:45:23,161
Did you know Peter used to
slip me broccoli under the table?

942
00:45:23,202 --> 00:45:25,637
Yuck!
Gag me with roughage!

943
00:45:43,724 --> 00:45:44,802
Whoa!

944
00:45:45,459 --> 00:45:46,654
Shadow.

945
00:45:46,724 --> 00:45:48,569
Shadow, Shadow.

946
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:50,412
Shadow! Shadow!

947
00:45:50,476 --> 00:45:52,037
Shadow. Shadow. Shadow. Shadow.

948
00:45:52,072 --> 00:45:54,029
Shadow! Shadow!

949
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:55,092
Shadow!

950
00:45:55,154 --> 00:45:56,522
- Shadow!
- What?

951
00:45:56,556 --> 00:45:58,755
There's a b-b-big,
a ca-- a h--

952
00:45:58,798 --> 00:46:00,802
a huge cat!

953
00:46:01,232 --> 00:46:04,349
Balderdash.
You're smelling things.

954
00:46:04,413 --> 00:46:06,716
Now, stop scaring the fish.

955
00:46:06,881 --> 00:46:09,060
Bu-But it was there!

956
00:46:09,209 --> 00:46:11,834
I-I didn’t just smell it! I--

957
00:46:13,369 --> 00:46:14,956
There it is again!

958
00:46:14,995 --> 00:46:16,940
Shadow! Sh-Shadow!

959
00:46:16,963 --> 00:46:19,440
- Shadow!
- Young dog, just--

960
00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:21,862
Run!

961
00:46:25,515 --> 00:46:28,270
I'm such a wimp.
I'm running from a cat!

962
00:46:28,311 --> 00:46:30,100
I won't tell if you won't.

963
00:46:30,133 --> 00:46:32,318
Of course, this isn't
your ordinary house cat.

964
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:35,982
I mean this is like Arnold Schwarze-kitty!

965
00:46:47,728 --> 00:46:48,948
Listen, if I don't make it,

966
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:51,253
well, I got a pile of bones
buried in the backyard.

967
00:46:51,293 --> 00:46:53,112
- We'll make it.
- And uh...

968
00:46:53,378 --> 00:46:56,534
I knew it! We're trapped!
We're goners!

969
00:46:57,287 --> 00:46:58,388
Uh.

970
00:46:58,442 --> 00:47:01,106
Look, the bones are buried
next to the jungle gym, and...

971
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:03,919
oh, the TV remote control
is under the seesaw.

972
00:47:04,042 --> 00:47:05,521
Seesaw?

973
00:47:05,849 --> 00:47:07,231
Seesaw!

974
00:47:07,411 --> 00:47:10,247
- Chance, you're a genius!
- I am not.

975
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:11,544
What's a genius?

976
00:47:11,591 --> 00:47:14,521
Never mind.
This is gonna take teamwork.

977
00:48:07,796 --> 00:48:10,043
I sure hope this works.

978
00:48:11,141 --> 00:48:12,528
Get ready, Chance.

979
00:48:12,567 --> 00:48:13,637
Here he comes.

980
00:48:13,676 --> 00:48:15,246
He's right behind me.

981
00:48:15,286 --> 00:48:16,848
Wait for my signal, okay?

982
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,590
And get down.

983
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:31,399
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

984
00:48:33,987 --> 00:48:36,118
Come on. Come on.

985
00:48:39,796 --> 00:48:41,340
Get ready, Chance.

986
00:48:41,604 --> 00:48:43,746
I'm ready, I'm ready.

987
00:48:45,554 --> 00:48:47,230
Not yet.

988
00:48:47,419 --> 00:48:49,152
Almost.

989
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:50,972
Now!

990
00:48:51,722 --> 00:48:53,605
Hey, cut it out.

991
00:48:54,346 --> 00:48:58,056
- Chance, now!
- Oh, hasta la vista, kitty!

992
00:48:58,078 --> 00:48:59,786
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!

993
00:48:59,857 --> 00:49:02,348
Yes, awesome!

994
00:49:02,653 --> 00:49:04,364
- Yeah!
- We did it!

995
00:49:04,404 --> 00:49:07,279
Whoa! Couple of geniuses!
Right, Shadow?

996
00:49:07,395 --> 00:49:09,044
Yes!

997
00:49:09,232 --> 00:49:10,505
Look at that!

998
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:15,747
Hey! Hey!
Dogs rule and cats drool!

999
00:49:15,809 --> 00:49:18,052
Ha-hah! Woo!

1000
00:49:22,064 --> 00:49:23,675
What's that?

1001
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:28,668
Shadow?

1002
00:49:28,878 --> 00:49:30,050
Shadow!

1003
00:49:30,097 --> 00:49:31,448
And Chance!

1004
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:33,699
All right, all right.

1005
00:49:33,876 --> 00:49:35,894
But, take care of yourself now.

1006
00:49:35,938 --> 00:49:38,433
And steer clear of the river!

1007
00:49:39,215 --> 00:49:41,378
Come on, guys, keep barking.

1008
00:49:41,449 --> 00:49:43,519
Let me know where you are.

1009
00:49:48,407 --> 00:49:49,881
P.U.!

1010
00:49:49,952 --> 00:49:51,834
They were here, all right.

1011
00:49:56,935 --> 00:49:58,310
You were great!

1012
00:49:58,349 --> 00:50:00,396
- You were like Rin Tin Tin!
- Like who?

1013
00:50:00,432 --> 00:50:02,325
Rin Tin Tin!
Don't you ever watch TV?

1014
00:50:02,357 --> 00:50:04,558
- Ah, that's not real.
- Oh, it's too.

1015
00:50:04,583 --> 00:50:06,013
You can't smell it, can you?

1016
00:50:06,061 --> 00:50:08,302
Well, anyway, you were great.

1017
00:50:08,357 --> 00:50:11,075
Okay, okay. Thanks, Chance.

1018
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:16,482
Sassy?

1019
00:50:16,602 --> 00:50:18,052
Couldn't be.

1020
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:20,661
- Sassy!
- Sassy!

1021
00:50:20,705 --> 00:50:21,927
My boys!

1022
00:50:22,021 --> 00:50:24,013
- My boys!
- Sassy!

1023
00:50:24,294 --> 00:50:26,153
- Sassy! Sass-- oh, gopher hole!

1024
00:50:26,178 --> 00:50:27,372
Chance!

1025
00:50:27,419 --> 00:50:28,872
- Shadow!
- Sassy!

1026
00:50:28,908 --> 00:50:30,434
Oh, Shadow!

1027
00:50:30,459 --> 00:50:33,341
- I thought I would never see you again!
- Oh, Sassy, you're alive!

1028
00:50:33,412 --> 00:50:34,958
- Sassy!
- Oh, I missed you...

1029
00:50:35,013 --> 00:50:37,466
- so much!
- Oh, I missed you so much, Sassy.

1030
00:50:37,505 --> 00:50:38,716
- Yeah, me too.
- Really?

1031
00:50:38,758 --> 00:50:40,825
Well, uh, yeah, well,
we could use you around.

1032
00:50:40,855 --> 00:50:42,101
I missed you too, Chance.

1033
00:50:42,126 --> 00:50:44,146
Hey, can we go fishing now?
Sassy, you have to help me.

1034
00:50:44,171 --> 00:50:46,992
Oh, Chance, you are hopeless.
But all right,

1035
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:48,132
let's go fishing.

1036
00:50:48,195 --> 00:50:50,618
Yes! Fish, fish, fish, fish, fish.

1037
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:53,939
Great fish, Sassy.

1038
00:50:53,978 --> 00:50:56,502
Full stomach sure feels good.

1039
00:50:56,545 --> 00:50:58,751
Yeah, I guess, I could have pigged out.

1040
00:50:58,822 --> 00:51:00,611
Oh, excuse me.

1041
00:51:00,655 --> 00:51:02,142
We'd better get a move on.

1042
00:51:02,189 --> 00:51:04,673
We can still make a few miles before dark.

1043
00:51:04,708 --> 00:51:08,095
I'd give anything to have Hope
scoop me up in her arms right now.

1044
00:51:08,134 --> 00:51:10,608
Yeah, well, I can't wait to see
the look on Jamie's face

1045
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:11,866
when we come strolling up.

1046
00:51:11,896 --> 00:51:14,298
Jamie? I thought
you didn't care about him.

1047
00:51:14,331 --> 00:51:15,716
Why, of--

1048
00:51:16,329 --> 00:51:17,419
Whoa! Hey!

1049
00:51:17,474 --> 00:51:19,357
Check it out.
Intruder at 4 o'clock.

1050
00:51:19,396 --> 00:51:21,240
- What is that?
- You got me.

1051
00:51:21,279 --> 00:51:23,540
I think it's a squirrel
having a really bad hair day.

1052
00:51:23,763 --> 00:51:26,154
- Whoa! Hey!
- Leave it alone, Chance.

1053
00:51:26,194 --> 00:51:28,068
Are you kidding me?
I gotta check this out.

1054
00:51:28,123 --> 00:51:29,599
Hey, you, pal.

1055
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:30,927
No, don't!

1056
00:51:31,006 --> 00:51:32,357
Doesn't smell right.

1057
00:51:32,410 --> 00:51:35,818
Will you look at this guy?
This is like mondo bizarro.

1058
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:36,911
All right, pal.

1059
00:51:36,943 --> 00:51:38,974
You know the routine.
Assume the position.

1060
00:51:39,026 --> 00:51:41,310
I sniff you, you sniff me.

1061
00:51:41,412 --> 00:51:43,388
Hey, hey, hey,
where are you going?

1062
00:51:43,450 --> 00:51:46,054
Hey, did I say you could go?
Come back here.

1063
00:51:46,093 --> 00:51:49,108
Hey, what about that hair?
What, you stick your tongue in a toaster?

1064
00:51:49,171 --> 00:51:51,177
Huh? Ah! Ah! Ah!

1065
00:51:51,202 --> 00:51:52,874
He bit me with his butt!

1066
00:51:52,905 --> 00:51:54,546
Oh, oh, oh.

1067
00:51:54,578 --> 00:51:57,077
Ah, ah, ah, oh.

1068
00:51:57,132 --> 00:52:00,491
Oh, Chance, you really are
a bulldog, aren't you?

1069
00:52:00,538 --> 00:52:03,015
I was just curious.

1070
00:52:03,070 --> 00:52:04,132
Oh.

1071
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:05,554
Like my mother always said,

1072
00:52:05,609 --> 00:52:07,132
"Curiosity killed the dog.''

1073
00:52:07,171 --> 00:52:09,577
Sassy, can you pull those things out?

1074
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,163
I'll try.

1075
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:18,329
Sassy, Sassy, you got my lip!

1076
00:52:18,376 --> 00:52:20,243
- You got my lip.
- It's all right.

1077
00:52:20,283 --> 00:52:21,431
I'm a professional.

1078
00:52:21,485 --> 00:52:23,548
They look like they're in deep.

1079
00:52:23,759 --> 00:52:25,181
Really deep.

1080
00:52:25,249 --> 00:52:28,399
Whatever you do, don't lick yourself.

1081
00:52:31,233 --> 00:52:32,874
Jerk.

1082
00:52:33,207 --> 00:52:34,555
Yeah, right. Get in here.

1083
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:35,702
Come on, man.

1084
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:37,395
- I didn't do nothing.
- Right in, right in here.

1085
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:39,241
Just tell us what you know.
Move right through the door.

1086
00:52:39,266 --> 00:52:40,569
- Excuse us, excuse us.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1087
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,030
Get in here.

1088
00:52:45,072 --> 00:52:46,666
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

1089
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:48,948
I need some help finding
a member of my family.

1090
00:52:49,011 --> 00:52:50,081
Mm-hm.

1091
00:52:50,144 --> 00:52:52,096
Actually, three members of my family.

1092
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:53,487
How long they been missing?

1093
00:52:53,526 --> 00:52:56,080
- Well, they ran away about a week ago.
- Mm-hm. Your name?

1094
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:57,565
Peter Burnford.

1095
00:52:57,643 --> 00:52:59,229
- Where are your parents?
- <i>All right.</i>

1096
00:52:59,307 --> 00:53:01,487
They, they don't know I'm here.

1097
00:53:01,575 --> 00:53:03,073
You better give me their names.

1098
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:04,862
Laura Burnford, that's my mom.

1099
00:53:04,893 --> 00:53:06,432
- All right, let's go.
- And my dad--

1100
00:53:06,487 --> 00:53:08,838
Well, her husband's name is Bob Seaver.

1101
00:53:08,964 --> 00:53:11,924
I need a physical description
of the missing persons.

1102
00:53:12,171 --> 00:53:13,409
Well, there's Shadow.

1103
00:53:13,456 --> 00:53:15,448
He's got brown eyes
and sandy-colored hair.

1104
00:53:15,489 --> 00:53:17,596
And Sassy's got blue eyes.
She's Himalayan.

1105
00:53:17,692 --> 00:53:19,120
Himalayan?

1106
00:53:19,245 --> 00:53:20,440
That's right.

1107
00:53:20,537 --> 00:53:21,768
And Chance is, well,

1108
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:23,721
he's white with black spots.

1109
00:53:23,873 --> 00:53:25,455
Black spots?

1110
00:53:26,229 --> 00:53:27,573
That's right.

1111
00:53:27,651 --> 00:53:28,682
Look, kid.

1112
00:53:28,721 --> 00:53:30,979
This is the San Francisco
Police Department.

1113
00:53:31,027 --> 00:53:33,573
We can't go chasing after
stray cats and dogs.

1114
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:34,643
I'm sorry.

1115
00:53:34,674 --> 00:53:36,526
But, we got more important things to do.

1116
00:53:36,575 --> 00:53:39,510
Well, this is important to me,
and my brother and sister.

1117
00:53:39,592 --> 00:53:42,534
What are we supposed to do,
just forget about them?

1118
00:53:45,906 --> 00:53:47,875
Let me tell you something
that might help you out.

1119
00:53:47,922 --> 00:53:49,838
Sometimes, when we're
looking for a suspect...

1120
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:52,799
we make up these reward posters
and we put them up all over the city.

1121
00:53:52,851 --> 00:53:54,664
Now, sometimes it works,

1122
00:53:54,766 --> 00:53:57,188
sometimes it doesn't. But...

1123
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:58,945
it's a shot.

1124
00:53:59,337 --> 00:54:01,539
Yeah, maybe I'll do that.

1125
00:54:02,515 --> 00:54:03,906
Hey, kid.

1126
00:54:04,037 --> 00:54:06,133
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

1127
00:54:13,944 --> 00:54:15,342
Peter?

1128
00:54:15,435 --> 00:54:18,045
Do you want me
to help you find something?

1129
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:20,248
Mom?

1130
00:54:20,306 --> 00:54:21,443
Who made these?

1131
00:54:21,491 --> 00:54:22,959
Bob did.

1132
00:54:23,256 --> 00:54:24,366
He did?

1133
00:54:24,397 --> 00:54:25,857
Yeah, he sent them everywhere.

1134
00:54:25,921 --> 00:54:27,850
Why didn't he say anything about it?

1135
00:54:27,943 --> 00:54:29,764
After the way you talked to him
the other night,

1136
00:54:29,795 --> 00:54:31,960
I think he's afraid
to even look at you.

1137
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:34,576
And he didn't want
to get your hopes up.

1138
00:54:35,003 --> 00:54:36,873
Has anyone called?

1139
00:54:40,576 --> 00:54:43,287
- I miss Shadow, Mom.
- Oh, honey.

1140
00:54:43,498 --> 00:54:46,037
- I really miss him.
- I know you do.

1141
00:55:08,515 --> 00:55:10,020
You gonna make it, Chance?

1142
00:55:10,067 --> 00:55:12,020
Yeah, sure.

1143
00:55:12,107 --> 00:55:14,012
You go ahead, Sassy.

1144
00:55:21,643 --> 00:55:23,315
Oh, no.

1145
00:55:25,675 --> 00:55:27,066
Oh.

1146
00:55:27,511 --> 00:55:28,894
Don't worry, Chance.

1147
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:31,597
The water,
it, it, it isn't so bad.

1148
00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:32,940
Yeah, sure.

1149
00:55:33,035 --> 00:55:34,144
No, really.

1150
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:36,144
If we can just hold his head
above the water--

1151
00:55:36,183 --> 00:55:37,862
Wait, listen.

1152
00:55:38,409 --> 00:55:39,730
Now what?

1153
00:55:39,761 --> 00:55:40,800
I don't know.

1154
00:55:40,825 --> 00:55:42,800
Stay there. I'll find out.

1155
00:55:51,738 --> 00:55:53,744
Mommy!

1156
00:56:07,537 --> 00:56:09,185
No.

1157
00:56:09,265 --> 00:56:10,888
Don't be afraid.

1158
00:56:10,982 --> 00:56:12,639
Good dog.

1159
00:56:15,247 --> 00:56:16,880
Doggie?

1160
00:56:19,643 --> 00:56:20,888
Sassy?

1161
00:56:20,967 --> 00:56:22,295
Chance?

1162
00:56:29,755 --> 00:56:31,722
It's okay.

1163
00:56:35,958 --> 00:56:37,497
Okay.

1164
00:56:38,334 --> 00:56:41,162
You poor thing! She's lost.

1165
00:56:41,225 --> 00:56:44,146
Yeah, I know how she feels.

1166
00:56:44,667 --> 00:56:46,490
It's okay.

1167
00:56:47,843 --> 00:56:49,490
Okay.

1168
00:56:54,797 --> 00:56:57,466
Molly!

1169
00:56:58,045 --> 00:56:59,654
Molly!

1170
00:56:59,803 --> 00:57:02,177
Molly!

1171
00:57:02,208 --> 00:57:03,778
Molly.

1172
00:57:04,566 --> 00:57:07,911
- Molly!
- Molly!

1173
00:57:09,543 --> 00:57:12,153
Molly!

1174
00:57:13,414 --> 00:57:17,020
Molly!

1175
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:24,505
- Shadow, is that people?

1176
00:57:24,535 --> 00:57:26,341
Yes, I'm going to find them.

1177
00:57:26,372 --> 00:57:28,075
No! No strangers, Shadow.

1178
00:57:28,099 --> 00:57:30,677
They'll take us to the pound and
lock us up, we'll never come out again.

1179
00:57:30,708 --> 00:57:32,341
They're just looking
for the little girl, Chance.

1180
00:57:32,372 --> 00:57:34,434
She needs us.
We have to help.

1181
00:57:34,513 --> 00:57:35,778
Oh.

1182
00:57:35,842 --> 00:57:37,591
I hope you know what you're doing.

1183
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:39,622
I don't wanna go back there again...

1184
00:57:39,684 --> 00:57:41,442
- ever.
- Don't worry.

1185
00:57:41,490 --> 00:57:43,044
- Molly!
- Sassy.

1186
00:57:43,090 --> 00:57:45,192
You keep her warm.
I'll be right back.

1187
00:57:45,272 --> 00:57:47,172
Hurry, Shadow.

1188
00:57:55,016 --> 00:57:56,980
Molly!

1189
00:57:57,614 --> 00:57:59,621
Molly!

1190
00:58:00,152 --> 00:58:02,590
Molly!

1191
00:58:07,236 --> 00:58:08,918
What is it, old fella?

1192
00:58:17,466 --> 00:58:18,957
Oh.

1193
00:58:24,505 --> 00:58:25,613
Molly!

1194
00:58:25,706 --> 00:58:27,363
- Molly!
- Daddy!

1195
00:58:27,386 --> 00:58:29,168
- Molly honey.
- Molly!

1196
00:58:29,205 --> 00:58:30,988
- You okay.
- Mommy!

1197
00:58:31,013 --> 00:58:32,480
- Mommy!
- Oh, Sheriff.

1198
00:58:32,528 --> 00:58:34,176
Yeah, we found her.

1199
00:58:39,775 --> 00:58:42,009
Are you okay?

1200
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,541
I'm not so sure about this.

1201
00:58:46,596 --> 00:58:48,728
It's gonna be all right.

1202
00:58:51,836 --> 00:58:53,156
Thank you...

1203
00:58:53,273 --> 00:58:55,617
for saving my little girl's life.

1204
00:59:00,008 --> 00:59:02,408
Uniforms, they've got uniforms.

1205
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:03,549
- It's okay.
- Hey.

1206
00:59:03,589 --> 00:59:05,369
- They're here to help.
- Wait a minute.

1207
00:59:05,471 --> 00:59:07,127
I know you guys.

1208
00:59:07,194 --> 00:59:08,955
Mark, get over here.

1209
00:59:09,088 --> 00:59:10,346
Look at this.

1210
00:59:10,383 --> 00:59:13,705
Mark, these are the animals
that were on the flyer we got.

1211
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:16,768
- I can't believe it.
- Yeah, these are them.

1212
00:59:16,830 --> 00:59:18,815
This guy's in pretty bad need of a vet.

1213
00:59:18,846 --> 00:59:20,010
Okay, guys.

1214
00:59:20,057 --> 00:59:22,518
Okay, guys.
You're going home.

1215
00:59:22,688 --> 00:59:25,010
- Home?
- Oh, yeah, you're going home.

1216
00:59:25,056 --> 00:59:26,704
Home!

1217
00:59:30,924 --> 00:59:32,692
Is this a Robert Seaver?

1218
00:59:32,763 --> 00:59:34,082
Yes?

1219
00:59:35,192 --> 00:59:36,496
When?

1220
00:59:36,614 --> 00:59:37,809
You--

1221
00:59:38,129 --> 00:59:39,559
You found them?

1222
00:59:39,762 --> 00:59:41,536
Well, that's great!

1223
00:59:41,608 --> 00:59:43,348
They're okay.

1224
00:59:43,586 --> 00:59:46,746
They've been taken to the Pineville
Animal Shelter on Route 90.

1225
00:59:46,819 --> 00:59:48,028
Thank, thank you.

1226
00:59:48,083 --> 00:59:49,668
Yes!

1227
00:59:55,523 --> 00:59:57,422
Yes! Oh, yes!

1228
00:59:57,477 --> 00:59:59,001
All right!

1229
00:59:59,313 --> 01:00:00,523
Hope!

1230
01:00:00,578 --> 01:00:02,047
Come on!

1231
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:08,266
All right, children.
Now, settle down, settle down.

1232
01:00:08,346 --> 01:00:09,359
All right.

1233
01:00:09,406 --> 01:00:11,234
Now, let's see.

1234
01:00:11,373 --> 01:00:12,836
Jamie!

1235
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:14,180
Mom?

1236
01:00:14,228 --> 01:00:15,461
We found them!

1237
01:00:15,508 --> 01:00:18,243
Yeah!

1238
01:00:19,832 --> 01:00:22,964
- What? Found who?
- Yes, yes.

1239
01:00:23,051 --> 01:00:24,504
- Come on.
- Let's go!

1240
01:00:24,550 --> 01:00:27,839
Sorry about the magic pumpkin,
Miss Winters. We'll replace it.

1241
01:00:32,215 --> 01:00:33,262
Wait a minute.

1242
01:00:33,293 --> 01:00:34,457
We've turned around.

1243
01:00:34,505 --> 01:00:35,739
What do you mean?

1244
01:00:35,785 --> 01:00:38,067
- What are you talking about?
- This isn't right.

1245
01:00:38,113 --> 01:00:39,738
Home's the other way.

1246
01:00:40,949 --> 01:00:42,809
They took us to the pound!

1247
01:00:42,841 --> 01:00:44,317
I told you. This is it.

1248
01:00:44,347 --> 01:00:45,621
This is the end of the line!

1249
01:00:45,646 --> 01:00:48,317
- We gotta get outta here!
- No, Chance. Just calm down.

1250
01:00:48,361 --> 01:00:50,270
No! You don't understand!

1251
01:00:50,333 --> 01:00:52,317
Dogs and cats come in here and...

1252
01:00:52,352 --> 01:00:55,051
they disappear and
you never see them again!

1253
01:00:55,076 --> 01:00:56,254
It's okay, Chance.

1254
01:00:56,294 --> 01:00:58,160
- These people are trying to help.
- Calm down.

1255
01:00:58,197 --> 01:00:59,895
- Nobody's gonna hurt you.
- Shadow! Help!

1256
01:00:59,934 --> 01:01:02,020
Hey! What do you to--?

1257
01:01:07,204 --> 01:01:09,262
Shadow! Shadow!

1258
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:11,864
Shadow, help!

1259
01:01:11,903 --> 01:01:13,708
- Help me. Shadow.
- It's okay.

1260
01:01:13,746 --> 01:01:15,160
Come on, it's okay.

1261
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:18,207
Oh, no, don't let him
take me in the back room!

1262
01:01:18,283 --> 01:01:21,379
No! Shadow, please, help me!

1263
01:01:21,434 --> 01:01:22,895
Shadow!

1264
01:01:22,939 --> 01:01:24,387
Run, Sassy, run!

1265
01:01:24,442 --> 01:01:27,613
- Save yourself!
- Okay, Missy, your turn.

1266
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:29,754
No. Wait a minute.

1267
01:01:30,075 --> 01:01:31,536
Kirkwood!

1268
01:01:41,306 --> 01:01:43,518
Your family's gonna be here real soon.

1269
01:01:44,503 --> 01:01:46,917
So, this is it.

1270
01:01:47,034 --> 01:01:49,456
Chance knew all along.

1271
01:01:49,564 --> 01:01:51,604
Took off that way.
Can't be too far.

1272
01:01:51,653 --> 01:01:53,292
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

1273
01:01:53,417 --> 01:01:55,487
Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

1274
01:01:56,236 --> 01:01:58,909
- Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
- Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

1275
01:01:58,987 --> 01:02:02,089
- Not on your life, chubby.
- Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

1276
01:02:03,276 --> 01:02:04,846
Here, kitty.

1277
01:02:05,355 --> 01:02:06,612
Scat!

1278
01:02:06,817 --> 01:02:08,027
Darn.

1279
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:13,009
- Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
- No, dummy, dummy, dummy, dummy.

1280
01:02:13,159 --> 01:02:14,207
Dumb...

1281
01:02:14,254 --> 01:02:15,512
cat.

1282
01:02:16,025 --> 01:02:18,543
Oh!
What a bozo!

1283
01:02:19,069 --> 01:02:20,684
Hold on, boy.

1284
01:02:20,777 --> 01:02:22,169
- Hey.
- Let me take a look at you.

1285
01:02:22,199 --> 01:02:24,074
What are you guys gonna do?

1286
01:02:24,415 --> 01:02:27,645
You are one lucky pup.

1287
01:02:27,684 --> 01:02:28,762
- Yes.
- So what?

1288
01:02:28,793 --> 01:02:31,343
Hey, hey, get your paws off me.

1289
01:02:31,416 --> 01:02:34,324
I just got those two back.

1290
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:36,176
Hmm?

1291
01:02:36,231 --> 01:02:39,621
And I will not lose them now. Oop!

1292
01:02:44,017 --> 01:02:46,666
Oh, yeah.
Chow down, chubby.

1293
01:02:48,994 --> 01:02:50,369
Oh! Okay.

1294
01:02:50,401 --> 01:02:51,799
Okay, I'll talk.

1295
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:54,525
I left the gift on the carpet.

1296
01:02:54,634 --> 01:02:56,166
I let Sassy take the heat...

1297
01:02:56,198 --> 01:02:58,956
for the time I unrolled
the toilet paper all over the house.

1298
01:02:59,012 --> 01:03:01,518
I stole underwear on three occasions.

1299
01:03:01,588 --> 01:03:05,658
- Yike! Okay, okay. Four, four.
- It's all right. It's okay.

1300
01:03:06,163 --> 01:03:08,979
Hey, kitty.
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.

1301
01:03:09,018 --> 01:03:10,869
Hey, shake that tail, baby!

1302
01:03:10,894 --> 01:03:13,268
I don't believe it.
Catcalls.

1303
01:03:13,308 --> 01:03:16,580
Ha, ha.
Nice whiskers, baby!

1304
01:03:18,075 --> 01:03:20,477
So, big fella,
what are you in for?

1305
01:03:20,509 --> 01:03:21,602
Sassy?

1306
01:03:21,649 --> 01:03:24,087
- Sassy!
- Shh! Keep it down.

1307
01:03:24,119 --> 01:03:28,032
- I told you to run away.
- I never listen to dogs.

1308
01:03:28,071 --> 01:03:30,835
- Where's Chance?
- They took him into the back room.

1309
01:03:30,948 --> 01:03:32,977
I think something awful
is happening to him.

1310
01:03:33,015 --> 01:03:34,493
Ow! Ow!

1311
01:03:34,540 --> 01:03:36,946
Please, stop. Please, stop.

1312
01:03:36,978 --> 01:03:39,446
Oh, just let me die.

1313
01:03:39,470 --> 01:03:41,384
They're killing him, Sassy.

1314
01:03:41,528 --> 01:03:43,423
Knock it off!.

1315
01:03:46,362 --> 01:03:47,801
Hey, cat.

1316
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:49,113
How'd you get in here?

1317
01:03:49,145 --> 01:03:51,067
I'll take care of Tubbo.
You get Chance.

1318
01:03:51,098 --> 01:03:52,324
Woo!

1319
01:03:53,410 --> 01:03:55,035
Hey, I'm coming back for you.

1320
01:03:55,073 --> 01:03:56,574
Atta girl, Sassy.

1321
01:03:56,614 --> 01:03:58,692
All right, this way, Thunderbutt.

1322
01:03:59,091 --> 01:04:00,371
Chance.

1323
01:04:00,458 --> 01:04:01,770
Can ya hear me, Chance?

1324
01:04:01,823 --> 01:04:03,356
Ow! Shadow!

1325
01:04:03,387 --> 01:04:04,543
Shadow, please, help me!

1326
01:04:04,568 --> 01:04:05,707
- Please, please.
- How'd he get out?

1327
01:04:05,738 --> 01:04:08,278
- I don't know.
- Don't let them hurt me any more, please!

1328
01:04:08,364 --> 01:04:10,512
Woo-hoo! This way.

1329
01:04:10,924 --> 01:04:13,415
No, this way.
Just don't fall on me.

1330
01:04:13,478 --> 01:04:16,309
Okay, come on this way.
Thatta boy.

1331
01:04:16,428 --> 01:04:18,895
Am I bad? Oh, yes.

1332
01:04:18,956 --> 01:04:21,676
- Chance?
- Urgh! Enough already.

1333
01:04:21,724 --> 01:04:23,903
Hey, Shadow!
Are you there?

1334
01:04:23,950 --> 01:04:25,145
I'm out here, Chance.

1335
01:04:25,183 --> 01:04:28,223
- Well, get in here.
- See, old fella, your friend--

1336
01:04:28,535 --> 01:04:29,723
Ooh ooh ooh!

1337
01:04:29,767 --> 01:04:32,176
Get outta here.
Run, Chance! Run for it!

1338
01:04:32,231 --> 01:04:33,591
No!

1339
01:04:34,684 --> 01:04:35,879
Oh!

1340
01:04:35,935 --> 01:04:38,028
- Where's Sassy?
- She's on a secret mission.

1341
01:04:38,084 --> 01:04:40,442
- Whoa!
- I'm bad, I'm bad. I-- Oooh!

1342
01:04:40,481 --> 01:04:41,973
Ow! Oh!

1343
01:04:42,018 --> 01:04:43,192
That hurts.

1344
01:04:43,247 --> 01:04:44,630
Got you.

1345
01:04:46,489 --> 01:04:47,692
Oh!

1346
01:04:51,116 --> 01:04:52,694
Oh, oh!

1347
01:04:55,038 --> 01:04:56,788
Watch it, watch it!

1348
01:04:57,358 --> 01:04:58,757
Let her go!

1349
01:04:59,194 --> 01:05:00,272
Come on!

1350
01:05:00,328 --> 01:05:01,453
This way, guys!

1351
01:05:01,490 --> 01:05:03,046
- Come on!
- Kirkwood!

1352
01:05:03,093 --> 01:05:04,710
Kirkwood!

1353
01:05:04,772 --> 01:05:06,413
Kirkwood!

1354
01:05:15,425 --> 01:05:16,470
Hurry!

1355
01:05:16,510 --> 01:05:18,362
- Come on!
- Dig, dig.

1356
01:05:18,432 --> 01:05:19,830
Dig, Chance, dig!

1357
01:05:19,855 --> 01:05:21,729
I'm trying, I'm trying!

1358
01:05:21,807 --> 01:05:23,237
Aaah!

1359
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:35,108
Oh, no! I'm stuck!

1360
01:05:36,897 --> 01:05:39,022
Hurry! Here he comes!

1361
01:05:40,977 --> 01:05:42,100
Hurry up, Chance!

1362
01:05:42,139 --> 01:05:44,389
Ah! Aaah!
It's choking me!

1363
01:05:44,430 --> 01:05:46,210
You come back to Daddy.
Come on.

1364
01:05:46,265 --> 01:05:47,694
- No!
- Come on.

1365
01:05:47,757 --> 01:05:49,061
Get off of me!

1366
01:05:49,116 --> 01:05:50,319
Shadow!

1367
01:05:51,311 --> 01:05:52,795
I ain't going back!

1368
01:05:52,826 --> 01:05:54,959
No, no way!

1369
01:05:57,662 --> 01:05:59,295
Yes!

1370
01:06:06,754 --> 01:06:09,785

01:06:38,481 --> 01:06:41,308

1388
01:06:56,094 --> 01:06:57,633
Come on, come on,
let's go, guys.

1389
01:06:57,665 --> 01:06:58,954
No. Wait.

1390
01:06:58,993 --> 01:07:01,321
- What is it, Shadow?
- I don't know.

1391
01:07:01,391 --> 01:07:03,657
I got a funny feeling all of a sudden.

1392
01:07:03,783 --> 01:07:07,485
Like something's telling me
to go back the other way.

1393
01:07:07,532 --> 01:07:09,141
Strange, huh?

1394
01:07:09,188 --> 01:07:11,743
What, back to the pound?
What is he, crazy?

1395
01:07:11,784 --> 01:07:13,860
Yeah, you're right.

1396
01:07:30,808 --> 01:07:34,091
<i>Shadow and Sassy had
risked their lives for me.</i>

1397
01:07:34,381 --> 01:07:36,943
<i>I never knew I'd have friends like that.</i>

1398
01:07:37,522 --> 01:07:40,427
<i>The feeling was all very new to me.</i>

1399
01:07:40,678 --> 01:07:42,443
<i>I liked it.</i>

1400
01:07:49,421 --> 01:07:51,710
I'm sorry this worked out this way, sir.

1401
01:07:51,764 --> 01:07:53,171
Yeah, me too.

1402
01:07:53,224 --> 01:07:54,679
Thanks.

1403
01:07:56,611 --> 01:07:58,522
Let's keep looking, Mom.

1404
01:07:58,585 --> 01:08:01,866
- They were just here.
- Oh, oh, honey, that was hours ago.

1405
01:08:01,909 --> 01:08:04,796
I mean, they could be miles away by now.

1406
01:08:05,798 --> 01:08:07,132
Listen to me, the...

1407
01:08:07,195 --> 01:08:10,742
the people here have promised
to do everything they can. And, and...

1408
01:08:10,801 --> 01:08:13,585
they'll call us the minute
as they get word.

1409
01:08:17,545 --> 01:08:20,217
We came so close to getting them back.

1410
01:08:21,046 --> 01:08:23,467
At least, we know they're alive.

1411
01:08:24,827 --> 01:08:28,421
The animals made it this far,
they just might make it all the way home.

1412
01:08:28,588 --> 01:08:30,780
Shadow!

1413
01:08:31,327 --> 01:08:33,023
We can't give up.

1414
01:08:33,933 --> 01:08:36,116
Shadow!

1415
01:08:38,408 --> 01:08:40,808
Shadow!

1416
01:08:47,497 --> 01:08:49,247
Are we going in circles?

1417
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:50,974
That tree smells familiar.

1418
01:08:51,013 --> 01:08:53,443
Of course it does. It's pine.

1419
01:08:53,498 --> 01:08:54,849
Oh.

1420
01:08:58,867 --> 01:09:00,320
Hurry up!

1421
01:09:00,375 --> 01:09:03,031
Oh, look, you guys.

1422
01:09:03,187 --> 01:09:04,797
We made it!

1423
01:09:10,919 --> 01:09:12,138
Wow!

1424
01:09:12,294 --> 01:09:14,544
Shadow, this is incredible.

1425
01:09:14,763 --> 01:09:16,396
You were right all along.

1426
01:09:16,458 --> 01:09:20,036
Oh, isn't that the most
beautiful sight you ever saw?

1427
01:09:20,150 --> 01:09:21,583
Come on, you two.

1428
01:09:22,036 --> 01:09:23,637
Let's go home.

1429
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:29,465
<i>Even now,</i>

1430
01:09:29,513 --> 01:09:31,645
<i>I don't really know how he did it.</i>

1431
01:09:31,803 --> 01:09:33,005
<i>But there we were.</i>

1432
01:09:33,075 --> 01:09:34,138
<i>Finally,</i>

1433
01:09:34,198 --> 01:09:37,559
<i>looking down at the road
that would lead us home.</i>

1434
01:09:46,913 --> 01:09:48,905
Home is just beyond these tracks.

1435
01:09:48,958 --> 01:09:50,733
We should be there before dark.

1436
01:09:50,858 --> 01:09:53,866
- I've heard that before.
- Just be very careful.

1437
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:05,233
Come on, you two.

1438
01:10:05,327 --> 01:10:06,757
Watch carefully where you're going.

1439
01:10:06,804 --> 01:10:08,374
Look both ways.

1440
01:10:09,383 --> 01:10:10,975
Stay with me. Hurry up.

1441
01:10:11,031 --> 01:10:12,398
Not so fast.

1442
01:10:12,452 --> 01:10:13,960
Come on, hurry up.

1443
01:10:15,644 --> 01:10:17,483
Come on! Come on!

1444
01:10:18,023 --> 01:10:20,202
I'm coming! Wait up!

1445
01:10:23,062 --> 01:10:24,586
You all right, Sass?

1446
01:10:24,806 --> 01:10:27,289
Me?
I laugh at danger.

1447
01:10:27,336 --> 01:10:28,414
Me too.

1448
01:10:28,473 --> 01:10:30,695
But I'll laugh later.
Let's get outta here.

1449
01:10:30,896 --> 01:10:33,531
I'm so sick of nature,
I could puke.

1450
01:10:33,601 --> 01:10:35,509
After this, I intend to live indoors,

1451
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:37,718
on a velvet cushion
filled with bird feathers...

1452
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:40,390
and be served filet of mouse
on a silver platter.

1453
01:10:40,415 --> 01:10:42,939
All right, Sassy.
We're nearly home.

1454
01:10:43,046 --> 01:10:44,453
Come on--

1455
01:10:47,177 --> 01:10:48,755
Shadow!

1456
01:10:52,757 --> 01:10:54,200
Shadow?

1457
01:10:54,498 --> 01:10:56,748
Oh, Shadow.

1458
01:11:10,052 --> 01:11:11,865
Poor old guy!

1459
01:11:12,576 --> 01:11:13,866
Huh?

1460
01:11:14,935 --> 01:11:15,967
Mmm!

1461
01:11:16,025 --> 01:11:17,092
Shadow?

1462
01:11:17,138 --> 01:11:19,357
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1463
01:11:19,615 --> 01:11:23,195
My leg hurts pretty badly.

1464
01:11:23,870 --> 01:11:24,945
Is it broken?

1465
01:11:25,008 --> 01:11:26,211
I don't know.

1466
01:11:26,328 --> 01:11:28,414
It's hard to move it.

1467
01:11:28,638 --> 01:11:30,726
Hey, hey, look at this.

1468
01:11:31,110 --> 01:11:32,985
It's not as steep over here, Shadow.

1469
01:11:33,066 --> 01:11:34,633
Maybe, you can climb out here.

1470
01:11:34,703 --> 01:11:36,344
I'll try.

1471
01:11:38,490 --> 01:11:40,460
Come on, come on, you can do it!

1472
01:11:40,523 --> 01:11:42,437
You got us this far.

1473
01:11:43,874 --> 01:11:45,523
Yeah, that's it.

1474
01:11:45,867 --> 01:11:46,969
That's it.

1475
01:11:47,023 --> 01:11:49,163
Great, keep coming.

1476
01:11:51,570 --> 01:11:52,617
Come on.

1477
01:11:52,656 --> 01:11:55,664
If you can jump in a river to save me,
this should be easy.

1478
01:11:55,694 --> 01:11:58,687
Yeah, that's right.
And after outrunning a mountain lion.

1479
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:00,203
Come on.

1480
01:12:00,245 --> 01:12:01,398
Come on, Shadow.

1481
01:12:01,437 --> 01:12:04,312
That's good. That's good now.
Take it slow now. Take it slow.

1482
01:12:04,350 --> 01:12:07,210
One step at a time.
One step at a time, Shadow.

1483
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:10,421
- Oh.
- Oh, oh, hang on.

1484
01:12:10,718 --> 01:12:13,609
Come on. Come right back.
Come right back.

1485
01:12:14,489 --> 01:12:16,913
Come on, you're so close.

1486
01:12:17,598 --> 01:12:19,249
Shadow!

1487
01:12:19,531 --> 01:12:22,163
- Shadow!
- Oh, Shadow.

1488
01:12:22,898 --> 01:12:25,312
Oh. No, no, no, don't lie down.

1489
01:12:25,374 --> 01:12:26,687
Don't lie down!

1490
01:12:26,738 --> 01:12:29,757
Sorry, I can't make it.

1491
01:12:29,788 --> 01:12:31,288
Why not?
Of course, you can make it.

1492
01:12:31,344 --> 01:12:32,672
Try, Shadow.

1493
01:12:32,766 --> 01:12:34,250
Please, try.

1494
01:12:34,348 --> 01:12:36,921
I just can't.

1495
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:53,407
Look, you pushed me this far.
Now, I'm pushing you the rest of the way.

1496
01:12:53,446 --> 01:12:55,915
You know, back there in the woods,
even when things looked really bad,

1497
01:12:55,932 --> 01:12:59,149
I always believed we'd make it because
I thought you were too stubborn to quit.

1498
01:12:59,214 --> 01:13:02,938
Well, you're not gonna quit.
Not now, not when we're this close!

1499
01:13:02,990 --> 01:13:04,547
Now, try again!

1500
01:13:04,603 --> 01:13:08,704
Do you think it's easy for me
to admit I can't do it?

1501
01:13:08,910 --> 01:13:10,165
I'm too old.

1502
01:13:10,217 --> 01:13:11,719
That's not true.

1503
01:13:11,798 --> 01:13:13,368
There's nothing you can't do.

1504
01:13:13,405 --> 01:13:16,008
I have nothing more to give, Chance.

1505
01:13:16,110 --> 01:13:20,032
And it's time for you to be on your own.

1506
01:13:20,430 --> 01:13:23,063
But, I want you with me.

1507
01:13:23,673 --> 01:13:25,915
I love you, Shadow.

1508
01:13:27,168 --> 01:13:31,180
You've learned everything
you need, Chance.

1509
01:13:32,206 --> 01:13:36,133
Now, all you have to learn
is how to say good-bye.

1510
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:48,713
I won't let you give up.

1511
01:14:01,871 --> 01:14:03,701
Now, I can't stay but a minute.

1512
01:14:03,726 --> 01:14:05,724
But, here's a welcome home pie for you.

1513
01:14:05,759 --> 01:14:07,667
Oh, thank you.

1514
01:14:08,168 --> 01:14:09,613
Where are the kids?

1515
01:14:09,651 --> 01:14:11,495
Oh, they're out in the backyard with Bob.

1516
01:14:11,527 --> 01:14:13,489
I know he's gonna break his neck.

1517
01:14:13,544 --> 01:14:14,925
How are they doing?

1518
01:14:14,988 --> 01:14:16,394
Um...

1519
01:14:16,779 --> 01:14:18,878
they're much better now
that we're back at home.

1520
01:14:18,923 --> 01:14:20,464
- Oh!
- Uh.

1521
01:14:20,645 --> 01:14:23,128
Burnford goes for the slam! Yes!

1522
01:14:23,189 --> 01:14:25,722
- Yeah!
- Yes, we win!

1523
01:14:25,761 --> 01:14:26,972
Ah!

1524
01:14:27,902 --> 01:14:29,697
Me next! Me next!

1525
01:14:29,738 --> 01:14:32,753
Ah, Hope, I think I'm getting
too old for this stuff.

1526
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:35,699
Oh, please, Daddy, please!

1527
01:14:43,710 --> 01:14:45,861
Yeah, come on, Dad.

1528
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:51,800
Okay.

1529
01:14:52,262 --> 01:14:53,488
- Get up.
- Oh.

1530
01:14:53,513 --> 01:14:54,519
- Ah, come on.
- Okay.

1531
01:14:54,547 --> 01:14:56,127
Now, don't let go whatever you do, huh?

1532
01:14:56,152 --> 01:14:57,074
- I won't.
- Hold on.

1533
01:14:57,116 --> 01:14:58,472
- Okay.
- Here we go!

1534
01:14:59,494 --> 01:15:01,066
Oh!

1535
01:15:01,533 --> 01:15:03,957
Did you hear that?

1536
01:15:06,773 --> 01:15:08,525
Hear what?

1537
01:15:12,332 --> 01:15:14,142
It's a dog!

1538
01:15:15,994 --> 01:15:19,337
- Okay, guys, turkey's on the table--
- Shhh!

1539
01:15:20,373 --> 01:15:22,478
Chance!

1540
01:15:27,909 --> 01:15:29,806
Oh, no, honey.

1541
01:15:29,884 --> 01:15:31,759
It's not--

1542
01:15:32,969 --> 01:15:34,688
Here, Chance!

1543
01:15:34,741 --> 01:15:36,438
Here, boy!

1544
01:15:38,586 --> 01:15:41,360
I know that bark.
It is him!

1545
01:15:41,936 --> 01:15:43,368
Jamie!

1546
01:15:43,416 --> 01:15:45,329
Chance! Chance!

1547
01:15:45,399 --> 01:15:46,743
Here, boy!

1548
01:15:46,798 --> 01:15:48,564
Jamie!

1549
01:15:48,614 --> 01:15:51,134
Jamie, my boy! Oh!

1550
01:15:51,229 --> 01:15:53,556
- Yes! Yes!
- Chance!

1551
01:15:53,712 --> 01:15:55,306
Yes! Jamie!

1552
01:15:55,376 --> 01:15:57,681
- Jamie!
- I knew it, I knew it, I knew it.

1553
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:58,610
- Jamie, Jamie.
- Chance.

1554
01:15:58,642 --> 01:16:00,423
you don't know how much I missed you
and all the things that happened.

1555
01:16:00,444 --> 01:16:02,384
Oh, Jamie,
you smell like a million bones!

1556
01:16:02,423 --> 01:16:05,173
You're my favorite boy in the whole world.
I love you, Jamie.

1557
01:16:05,212 --> 01:16:07,368
- Where have you been?
- How are you doing? How can you get, huh?

1558
01:16:07,407 --> 01:16:09,212
- Where have you been?
- Where have you been?

1559
01:16:09,244 --> 01:16:10,634
Oh, Chance.

1560
01:16:11,686 --> 01:16:12,892
Chance!

1561
01:16:13,049 --> 01:16:14,290
You scoundrel, you!

1562
01:16:14,330 --> 01:16:15,970
- You made it.
- Look at this guy.

1563
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:24,927
Sassy!

1564
01:16:25,216 --> 01:16:27,162
Oh, Hope! Hope!

1565
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:29,763
Hope! Hope! Hope! Oh!

1566
01:16:29,794 --> 01:16:31,662
- Oh, my baby.
- Oh, Hope.

1567
01:16:31,701 --> 01:16:34,466
- I thought I'd never see you again.
- Oh, Sassy.

1568
01:16:34,513 --> 01:16:35,599
- Oh.
- Sassy's back.

1569
01:16:35,630 --> 01:16:37,263
- Now, what do we have here?
- Sassy!

1570
01:16:37,288 --> 01:16:39,013
- Look at this.
- Oh, Sassy.

1571
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:42,068
I'm never gonna let you go.
Never, never, never.

1572
01:16:42,118 --> 01:16:44,662
Oh, sweetheart.
Sassy can't breathe.

1573
01:16:44,733 --> 01:16:47,747
Family's all coming back together, huh?

1574
01:16:58,327 --> 01:17:00,296
Come on, Shadow.

1575
01:17:23,418 --> 01:17:25,074
He was old.

1576
01:17:25,191 --> 01:17:26,894
It was too far.

1577
01:17:26,996 --> 01:17:28,645
He was just too old.

1578
01:17:28,691 --> 01:17:30,715
Oh, Peter, honey.

1579
01:17:50,551 --> 01:17:52,098
Peter.

1580
01:17:52,341 --> 01:17:53,825
Shadow!

1581
01:17:53,903 --> 01:17:55,832
Oh, Peter.

1582
01:17:56,091 --> 01:17:59,121
I worried about you so.

1583
01:18:05,027 --> 01:18:07,113
- Shadow!
- Peter!

1584
01:18:07,152 --> 01:18:08,676
- You're okay!
- Shadow!

1585
01:18:08,715 --> 01:18:09,980
He's here!

1586
01:18:10,019 --> 01:18:11,809
- Oh, I'm so happy.
- Shadow.

1587
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:14,223
I thought about you all the time.

1588
01:18:14,265 --> 01:18:16,019
Missed you.

1589
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:20,027
I missed you, Peter,
and I love you.

1590
01:18:29,326 --> 01:18:31,447
<i>It was Shadow's victory, really.</i>

1591
01:18:31,546 --> 01:18:34,361
<i>His belief was the thing
that got us through.</i>

1592
01:18:34,540 --> 01:18:37,924
<i>And in that moment,
I saw the years lift from him.</i>

1593
01:18:38,008 --> 01:18:39,541
<i>He was a puppy again,</i>

1594
01:18:39,651 --> 01:18:41,721
<i>reunited with his best friend.</i>

1595
01:18:41,776 --> 01:18:43,948
Come on. Come on.

1596
01:18:48,256 --> 01:18:51,231
Shadow!
Oh, it's good to see you, boy.

1597
01:18:51,990 --> 01:18:54,020
<i>As we turned to go inside the house...</i>

1598
01:18:54,083 --> 01:18:57,348
<i>a strange new feeling came over me.</i>

1599
01:18:57,502 --> 01:18:59,387
<i>I had a family.</i>

1600
01:18:59,778 --> 01:19:02,161
<i>And I had found out that sacrifice...</i>

1601
01:19:02,254 --> 01:19:03,872
<i>and friendship...</i>

1602
01:19:04,036 --> 01:19:05,739
<i>and even love...</i>

1603
01:19:05,889 --> 01:19:08,184
<i>were more than Just the mushy stuff.</i>

1604
01:19:08,292 --> 01:19:10,817
Come on, Chance.
Come inside.

1605
01:19:10,911 --> 01:19:12,489
<i>At last,</i>

1606
01:19:12,575 --> 01:19:15,528
<i>for the first time in my life...</i>

1607
01:19:15,729 --> 01:19:17,145
I was home.

1608
01:19:23,514 --> 01:19:24,658
Turkey!

1609
01:19:24,713 --> 01:19:28,369
Turkey, turkey, turkey, turkey,
turkey, turkey, turkey, turkey.
