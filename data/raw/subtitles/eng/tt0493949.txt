1
00:00:47,626 --> 00:00:49,593
My name's Ramona Q.

2
00:00:49,693 --> 00:00:54,153
I'm nine and three months, and no matter
what my sister Beezus tells you...

3
00:00:54,266 --> 00:00:55,858
I'm not a pest.

4
00:00:55,966 --> 00:01:00,460
My dad says I just have an overactive
imagination, which does come in handy.

5
00:01:00,571 --> 00:01:04,507
It makes the fun parts funner
and the scary parts scarier.

6
00:01:04,608 --> 00:01:07,907
And frankly, it's good
to scare yourself once in a while...

7
00:01:08,013 --> 00:01:09,946
'cause if you can't be brave at recess...

8
00:01:10,047 --> 00:01:11,981
how can you do it when it really counts?

9
00:01:12,084 --> 00:01:14,677
Okay, stay with me. You can do it, Ramona.

10
00:01:18,522 --> 00:01:21,514
I'll never make it, Howie. Whoa.

11
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,525
Owie, owie.

12
00:01:24,628 --> 00:01:28,428
That's my echo off the canyon,
canyon, canyon.

13
00:01:28,532 --> 00:01:31,763
Don't psych yourself out, Ramona.
Just don't look down.

14
00:01:40,311 --> 00:01:42,142
It's too far!

15
00:01:42,246 --> 00:01:45,340
Far! Far! Far!

16
00:02:01,197 --> 00:02:05,066
Howie, help!

17
00:02:05,168 --> 00:02:07,500
- Mrs. Meacham?

18
00:02:07,605 --> 00:02:11,165
Uh, Ramona's kind of hung up.

19
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:16,901
- Help, please.

20
00:02:17,013 --> 00:02:20,176
- Quiet. Face front.

21
00:02:20,283 --> 00:02:22,478
Ah! Help.

22
00:02:22,585 --> 00:02:24,849
Eyes forward. Lock it down.

23
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:32,093
Ramona Quimby, get down from there.
This isn't a circus.

24
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:46,238
You should have seen it
through a window. It was awesome.

25
00:02:46,341 --> 00:02:50,368
You looked like a pinata.
Well, obviously without all the candy.

26
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:53,004
It made me really dizzy,
yet I wanna do it again.

27
00:02:53,115 --> 00:02:55,982
- Race you home, mudball.

28
00:03:01,123 --> 00:03:02,954
- I won!
- See you tomorrow.

29
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:04,958
- Bye, Howie.
- Excuse me.

30
00:03:07,596 --> 00:03:10,861
- Ramona.

31
00:03:10,966 --> 00:03:12,900
Be more careful with Willa Jean.

32
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:15,298
- Huh?
- She's younger than you are.

33
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:17,702
- Ha-ha!

34
00:03:17,806 --> 00:03:19,501
- Ow.
- Willa Jean, come to Grammy.

35
00:03:39,026 --> 00:03:41,995
Mom, look it. I taught Roberta
how to stick out her tongue.

36
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:45,122
That's great, sweetie.
Now I can cancel the private tutor.

37
00:03:45,234 --> 00:03:48,828
- Next, can you teach her
how to change her own diaper?

38
00:03:48,936 --> 00:03:51,167
Could you set the table, please, Ramona?

39
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:54,036
And add another plate for Aunt Bea.
She's coming by later for dessert.

40
00:03:54,141 --> 00:03:55,836
- So five altogether?
- Yep.

41
00:03:55,943 --> 00:03:57,740
I was about to do that.

42
00:03:57,845 --> 00:04:01,303
Hmm. Being about to do it and doing it.

43
00:04:03,918 --> 00:04:08,445
- Mom! Beezus is acting all French again.

44
00:04:08,556 --> 00:04:10,456
Dad's home!

45
00:04:16,796 --> 00:04:19,230
Daddy!

46
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,834
Prepare for impact!

47
00:04:24,337 --> 00:04:26,532
- Hi, honey!
- Dad!

48
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,700
Hey! How are my beautiful girls?
Mwah!

49
00:04:29,809 --> 00:04:32,107
- Did you crunch the numbers, Dad?
- You bet I did, Pickle.

50
00:04:32,212 --> 00:04:34,442
- I crunched them good. Real good.

51
00:04:34,547 --> 00:04:36,276
- The whole darn day.

52
00:04:36,384 --> 00:04:38,351
I don't think you got dirty enough today,
Ramona.

53
00:04:38,451 --> 00:04:40,351
Well, there's always tomorrow.

54
00:04:40,453 --> 00:04:42,421
- Mwah!
- I'll let you two catch up.

55
00:04:42,522 --> 00:04:45,958
There's my little girl.
My little bowling ball with Legs.

56
00:04:46,059 --> 00:04:48,926
- Sorry about that, Icky Sticky.

57
00:04:49,029 --> 00:04:52,930
Dad, it's Picky Picky.

58
00:04:53,033 --> 00:04:57,402
- When are you ever gonna learn
his real name?
- When he learns mine.

59
00:04:57,504 --> 00:05:01,496
So, Beezus, suppose I told you that when l
pulled up in front of the house tonight...

60
00:05:01,608 --> 00:05:05,544
I saw your old buddy Henry staring at it like
he left something important inside.

61
00:05:05,644 --> 00:05:07,909
Henry Huggins?
I haven't heard that name in a while.

62
00:05:08,013 --> 00:05:10,038
Isn't he the boy
that used to eat dirt in the backyard?

63
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,981
- Yeah.
- He doesn't do that anymore.

64
00:05:12,085 --> 00:05:14,848
Ooh. If I didn't know better,
I'd say somebody has a crush.

65
00:05:14,953 --> 00:05:17,820
- Ooh-ooh!
- Can we please talk about something else?

66
00:05:17,923 --> 00:05:21,257
- There is that dance.
Maybe he wants to ask you to it.

67
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,420
Well, if he's gonna ask my girl to a dance,
he'd better have some moves.

68
00:05:24,531 --> 00:05:26,589
Can the old dirt-eater do this?

69
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,691
Ooh-hoo, whoo-hoo!

70
00:05:29,802 --> 00:05:31,998
Oh, I hope not. Stop.

71
00:05:32,104 --> 00:05:33,628
- Mom!

72
00:05:33,739 --> 00:05:35,832
What do we got here? Note from the bank.

73
00:05:35,941 --> 00:05:38,409
It could be loan papers for the addition.

74
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,775
- Hope they don't expect us to pay it back.
- Well, banks are funny that way.

75
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,646
What do we got here?
"To the Parents of Beatrice Quimby."

76
00:05:45,751 --> 00:05:48,446
Could this be the latest report card?

77
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,558
"Beatrice Quimby gets in fights...

78
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:56,150
"steals from the vending machines,
counterfeits hall passes.

79
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,990
- Wait. Let me see.
- We recommend juvenile prison. "

80
00:05:59,098 --> 00:06:02,089
All A's.

81
00:06:02,201 --> 00:06:04,361
- We're so proud of you.

82
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:07,667
- It's not funny.

83
00:06:11,377 --> 00:06:14,539
So, Ramona, Beatrice has her report card.

84
00:06:14,645 --> 00:06:17,910
Doesn't that mean-
I don't know- you should have one too?

85
00:06:18,015 --> 00:06:20,484
That old thing?

86
00:06:20,585 --> 00:06:24,385
Yeah, that old thing.
Where would that old thing happen to be?

87
00:06:38,236 --> 00:06:41,364
- That's a good place for it.
- Yeah, wouldn't want it to spoil.

88
00:06:46,376 --> 00:06:47,843
Oh.

89
00:06:52,717 --> 00:06:55,412
"Ramona is a bright young student"-

90
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,455
That's my girl. "... but lacks focus...

91
00:06:58,555 --> 00:07:01,388
"often daydreams,
disputes the need to spell words correctly...

92
00:07:01,491 --> 00:07:04,688
"and has very little respect
for the rules of grammar...

93
00:07:04,796 --> 00:07:06,763
or rules in general."

94
00:07:11,968 --> 00:07:14,562
- Oh.
- Why would she write this, Ramona?

95
00:07:14,671 --> 00:07:18,402
Because... she's no fun.

96
00:07:18,508 --> 00:07:22,069
- That is no excuse.
- But it's true.

97
00:07:22,179 --> 00:07:26,274
She makes us all use
the same words from the same list.

98
00:07:26,383 --> 00:07:30,546
And when I try to be original,
she just shoots me down.

99
00:07:30,654 --> 00:07:33,122
Like when I invented the word "terrifical."

100
00:07:33,223 --> 00:07:35,885
She goes, "Ramona, that's not a word."

101
00:07:35,991 --> 00:07:38,620
And I say, "It's a lot funner word to say."

102
00:07:38,727 --> 00:07:41,093
She goes, "Funner isn't a word either."

103
00:07:41,198 --> 00:07:43,257
What kind of teacher is that?

104
00:07:43,365 --> 00:07:46,130
She can't tell kids not to invent words.

105
00:07:46,235 --> 00:07:48,635
She's not the president of the world.

106
00:07:48,737 --> 00:07:51,831
- You butt out, Beezus.

107
00:07:51,942 --> 00:07:54,034
Ramona, Mrs. Meacham is your teacher.

108
00:07:54,143 --> 00:07:56,737
- You need to listen to her.
- And she's not that bad.

109
00:07:56,847 --> 00:07:59,440
She was fair with me when I was your age.

110
00:07:59,548 --> 00:08:01,413
Yeah, well-

111
00:08:01,517 --> 00:08:03,417
Everybody loves Beezus...

112
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:05,646
and everybody hates me!

113
00:08:05,754 --> 00:08:07,016
- Okay.

114
00:08:07,122 --> 00:08:10,319
- Why are you laughing?
- We're not laughing, sweetie.

115
00:08:13,262 --> 00:08:15,230
I'm gonna say a bad word.

116
00:08:17,266 --> 00:08:20,292
- You are?
- Mm-hmm.

117
00:08:20,401 --> 00:08:22,301
A really bad one.

118
00:08:22,403 --> 00:08:26,340
Well, if you feel the need to get one
out of your system, then go ahead.

119
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:36,676
- Guts!

120
00:08:38,254 --> 00:08:41,280
- Guts, guts, guts!

121
00:08:43,424 --> 00:08:47,292
- "G" word.
- That's your idea of a bad word, Ramona?

122
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,238
Honey, I'm sorry we laughed.

123
00:09:00,642 --> 00:09:02,109
- Hey.

124
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:25,528
Oh, oh, oh.

125
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:29,865
What's she done?

126
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:35,835
- Oh, guts!

127
00:09:43,217 --> 00:09:44,218
Hey, babe. How's the air up there?

128
00:09:44,218 --> 00:09:45,309
Hey, babe. How's the air up there?

129
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:47,410
Hi, Aunt Bea.

130
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:49,580
Aw, you can do better than that.

131
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,158
- Where's the love? Honk, honk.

132
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:56,586
I thought I'd find you here.

133
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:59,860
That was a fine job you did
on the toothpaste.

134
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:02,400
You must have a really strong grip.

135
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:04,401
Oh!

136
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:06,472
Let me see those calluses.

137
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:10,236
Oh, yeah.

138
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:13,608
all that time on the jungle gym
sure is paying off.

139
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:17,444
Did that one get bigger?
Tremendous. Trophy size.

140
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:22,315
You know...

141
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:27,648
I was a younger sister, too, once. Still am.

142
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,888
No matter how old I get,
I'll always be younger.

143
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,500
It's no fair, Aunt Bea.

144
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:39,467
I never do anything as good as Beezus.

145
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:44,607
- And Roberta, if she burps, it's adorable.
- Hmm.

146
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:48,008
Last week,
she poured applesauce on her head...

147
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:51,777
- and Dad stopped to take pictures.
- Oh!

148
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:56,719
I mean, when it's my turn to do stuff...

149
00:10:56,821 --> 00:10:58,790
nobody even cares.

150
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:02,485
Well, it's impossible to compete
with pouring food on your head.

151
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:04,562
Why do we even bother?

152
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,496
You know what? I bet it would be nice...

153
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,124
to have something of your own for once.

154
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:12,533
Like my own room?

155
00:11:12,637 --> 00:11:16,335
Maybe just something small...

156
00:11:16,441 --> 00:11:18,410
you could always have with you.

157
00:11:22,147 --> 00:11:24,206
Go ahead. Open it.

158
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,890
I found that picture the other day...

159
00:11:34,993 --> 00:11:39,156
and I realized I was exactly your age,
so I wanted you to have it.

160
00:11:39,264 --> 00:11:41,289
- That's you?
- Yeah.

161
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:44,890
There's room for another if you wanna
give that little girl some company.

162
00:11:45,003 --> 00:11:47,402
- Thank you, Aunt Bea.
- Mm-hmm.

163
00:11:50,341 --> 00:11:52,275
I want you to know...

164
00:11:52,377 --> 00:11:55,039
that you will always have me around.

165
00:11:57,816 --> 00:11:59,510
- Aw.
- Whoo!

166
00:11:59,616 --> 00:12:02,142
You okay?

167
00:12:02,252 --> 00:12:04,743
- I gotcha.

168
00:12:05,989 --> 00:12:07,980
Mmm. I gotcha.

169
00:12:13,564 --> 00:12:16,260
- Bring it up!

170
00:12:16,367 --> 00:12:18,300
Beezus, wake up!

171
00:12:18,402 --> 00:12:20,563
Beezus, come on.

172
00:12:26,944 --> 00:12:30,572
- To the right.

173
00:12:35,319 --> 00:12:37,685
Check it out, man.

174
00:12:40,624 --> 00:12:41,920
Ramona!

175
00:12:48,831 --> 00:12:51,299
- Okay. We're clear.

176
00:12:57,573 --> 00:12:59,438
- Whoo-hoo!

177
00:12:59,542 --> 00:13:00,510
- Whoo!
- Whoo-hoo!

178
00:13:06,582 --> 00:13:08,379
- Whoa!

179
00:13:19,195 --> 00:13:21,186
Control tower, we've reached 30,000 feet.

180
00:13:21,297 --> 00:13:24,130
Ramona, you are clear for airdrop.

181
00:13:24,232 --> 00:13:26,997
Whoo-hoo!

182
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,636
- Whoo!

183
00:13:46,855 --> 00:13:50,916
Whoa! Whoo!

184
00:13:51,026 --> 00:13:52,653
Whoa!

185
00:13:55,297 --> 00:13:58,323
- This is the best day ever!
- Whoo-hoo!

186
00:13:58,433 --> 00:14:00,834
Yeah. I wish we had a hole in our house.

187
00:14:00,936 --> 00:14:02,836
Hey, Ramona, let's make a deal.

188
00:14:02,938 --> 00:14:05,964
If you can settle down for a few hours,
I'll see if Dad can take us out to dinner.

189
00:14:06,074 --> 00:14:08,473
- Really?

190
00:14:08,577 --> 00:14:10,977
Can we go to Macaroni Joe's?

191
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:13,274
- There is an inch of dust
covering my whole kitchen.

192
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,508
- We can go anywhere.
- Yeah!

193
00:14:15,617 --> 00:14:16,982
Whoo!

194
00:14:17,085 --> 00:14:19,280
I'm having a hair crisis.

195
00:14:19,386 --> 00:14:22,515
But it looks the same as always.

196
00:14:23,557 --> 00:14:25,082
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

197
00:14:26,127 --> 00:14:27,788
- He's home!

198
00:14:37,104 --> 00:14:38,594
- Dad.
- Hey.

199
00:14:38,707 --> 00:14:40,037
Daddy!

200
00:14:40,141 --> 00:14:42,439
- Boing!
- Ohh!

201
00:14:42,543 --> 00:14:44,670
- Did you crunch the numbers, Dad?

202
00:14:44,778 --> 00:14:47,474
Well, today they kind of crunched me back.

203
00:14:48,516 --> 00:14:51,006
But I got you a little surprise.

204
00:14:52,419 --> 00:14:54,353
Why don't you and Beez
go outside and share those...

205
00:14:54,455 --> 00:14:58,152
and I'll talk to your mom for a minute, okay?

206
00:14:58,259 --> 00:15:00,489
- Let's go.
- Thank you.

207
00:15:14,475 --> 00:15:17,035
- Something's wrong.

208
00:15:17,143 --> 00:15:19,305
They let three people go last week.

209
00:15:19,412 --> 00:15:21,210
How can you tell?

210
00:15:21,314 --> 00:15:23,179
'Cause they're whispering.

211
00:15:25,418 --> 00:15:27,352
Did I do something wrong?

212
00:15:27,453 --> 00:15:28,853
No.

213
00:15:28,955 --> 00:15:31,355
Not this time.

214
00:15:31,457 --> 00:15:35,188
But something tells me
that we're not going to Macaroni Joe's.

215
00:15:41,634 --> 00:15:43,795
Hey, you got more red ones.

216
00:15:43,903 --> 00:15:45,928
all right. Take a few more.

217
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:48,769
Remember how I taught you to eat them.

218
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:51,708
- Bite the head off first?
- Yep.

219
00:15:51,811 --> 00:15:53,836
It's more humane that way.

220
00:15:55,548 --> 00:15:57,778
You don't deserve to be downsized.

221
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:04,815
"Downsized"? What's that mean?

222
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:07,949
Well, um...

223
00:16:08,061 --> 00:16:10,791
it means the storage company
was bought by a bigger one...

224
00:16:10,897 --> 00:16:14,924
and a lot of people were let go,
including Dad.

225
00:16:16,535 --> 00:16:18,662
The good news is
I called Dr. Perry's office...

226
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,830
and she has some part-time work
for me again...

227
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:23,908
so that should tide us over
for a little while, at least.

228
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,408
Don't worry. I will find a job.

229
00:16:27,512 --> 00:16:29,571
But in the meantime...

230
00:16:29,681 --> 00:16:32,741
I got a little extra time
to spend with my girls.

231
00:16:32,851 --> 00:16:34,318
Right?

232
00:16:36,321 --> 00:16:37,515
- Right?
- Right.

233
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:38,850
- Okay.
- Right.

234
00:16:41,892 --> 00:16:44,157
You realize we're gonna be poor now, right?

235
00:16:44,262 --> 00:16:46,525
No, we're not.

236
00:16:47,866 --> 00:16:50,733
- Are we?
- Have you seen how many bills they get?

237
00:16:50,836 --> 00:16:54,237
It's insane.
Everything costs money, even water.

238
00:16:54,338 --> 00:16:57,000
Well, Mom's gonna make money.

239
00:16:57,109 --> 00:17:00,805
And Dad, he'll be with us.

240
00:17:00,911 --> 00:17:02,379
That part's fun.

241
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:05,211
Well, get ready for another year
in hand-me-down heaven.

242
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:08,286
Hey, lights out, my lovelies.

243
00:17:08,387 --> 00:17:10,320
Sweet dreams.

244
00:17:21,065 --> 00:17:22,999
Beezus?

245
00:17:24,934 --> 00:17:28,564
It's sort of scary
having a hole in the house...

246
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:30,139
don't you think?

247
00:17:30,241 --> 00:17:33,472
- Beezus.
- Shh. I'm trying to sleep.

248
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:38,440
Beezus, did you hear that growling?

249
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:41,712
It's probably just your stomach, doofus.

250
00:17:43,788 --> 00:17:45,311
Unless-

251
00:17:46,489 --> 00:17:49,856
Unless it's something...

252
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,188
else.

253
00:17:51,294 --> 00:17:53,286
Beezus, stop it.

254
00:17:53,396 --> 00:17:56,490
- Like a ferocious, hungry-
- Stop!

255
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:59,932
slithering beast that feeds
on pests with bad report cards.

256
00:18:00,036 --> 00:18:02,267
- Ah!

257
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:05,398
You're too easy.

258
00:18:05,508 --> 00:18:07,443
Beezus, it's not funny.

259
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:09,445
I thought it was.

260
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,013
Bring it up.

261
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,318
Let me get a pen, write it down.

262
00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:18,352
- Both girls
get carrots and sandwiches.
- Okay.

263
00:18:18,455 --> 00:18:22,255
Beezus wants hers in a Ziploc,
and Ramona insists on having tin foil.

264
00:18:22,358 --> 00:18:25,554
She claims it affects the taste, but I think
she just likes making sculptures with it.

265
00:18:25,662 --> 00:18:29,188
What else? Ramona wants
a hard-boiled egg if we have any.

266
00:18:29,299 --> 00:18:31,289
Think fast.

267
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:34,096
Please tell me you're
gonna remember all this.

268
00:18:34,204 --> 00:18:36,535
Look at me- fully domesticated.

269
00:18:36,638 --> 00:18:39,539
I've lined up Mrs. Kemp
to watch Roberta at noon.

270
00:18:39,641 --> 00:18:43,202
- all you have to do
is go nail this interview today.
- How do I look?

271
00:18:44,848 --> 00:18:48,147
- I'd give you the job.
- Really?

272
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,615
I'd take it.

273
00:18:56,493 --> 00:18:58,619
- Ew!
- Ew!

274
00:19:00,129 --> 00:19:03,064
Ramona, did I ever show you the proper way...

275
00:19:03,165 --> 00:19:05,827
to crack a hard-boiled egg?

276
00:19:05,934 --> 00:19:07,265
Mm-mmm.

277
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:09,597
Hmm-hmm.

278
00:19:20,782 --> 00:19:22,773
You are so weird.

279
00:19:25,053 --> 00:19:27,817
- A guy's gotta get his protein somehow.

280
00:19:27,922 --> 00:19:31,086
- See, I got this stuff down.

281
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,893
Hey, Ramona, wait up!

282
00:19:42,003 --> 00:19:44,699
- Bye, Dad!
- Bye-bye!

283
00:19:53,414 --> 00:19:56,144
- Nice doodles.

284
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:59,651
They're not doodles. They're sketches.

285
00:19:59,754 --> 00:20:01,813
My dad's extremely sketchy.

286
00:20:01,923 --> 00:20:04,050
- Is everyone in their seats?

287
00:20:04,158 --> 00:20:06,126
I'm about to round the corner.

288
00:20:06,227 --> 00:20:08,127
And good morning.

289
00:20:08,229 --> 00:20:12,666
I trust you all survived the weekend
with most of your limbs intact.

290
00:20:12,767 --> 00:20:15,497
It's time we tackle our class reports.

291
00:20:15,603 --> 00:20:17,729
Tell us about something
special in your life...

292
00:20:17,838 --> 00:20:20,465
using at least one word
from our vocabulary list.

293
00:20:21,975 --> 00:20:24,466
This is my ballet tiara.

294
00:20:24,579 --> 00:20:25,705
Ooh.

295
00:20:25,812 --> 00:20:28,713
This is a saddle for riding camels.

296
00:20:28,815 --> 00:20:31,808
It's special to me
because I'm going to wear my tiara...

297
00:20:31,918 --> 00:20:35,150
when I audition for the part of the princess
in the Royal Peanut Butter commercials.

298
00:20:35,255 --> 00:20:37,917
And it's special because
my Uncle Hobart gave it to me.

299
00:20:38,024 --> 00:20:40,323
I think I'd be extraordinary in the role.

300
00:20:40,427 --> 00:20:42,827
E-X-T-R-A-O-R-D-I-N-A-R-Y.

301
00:20:42,929 --> 00:20:45,193
And he travels all over the world...

302
00:20:45,298 --> 00:20:48,165
taking pictures of animals
in their natural habitat.

303
00:20:48,268 --> 00:20:50,429
H-A-B-I-T-A-T.

304
00:20:50,537 --> 00:20:55,064
Extraordinary.
That's when you take something... ordinary...

305
00:20:56,942 --> 00:20:58,934
- and give it a little extra.

306
00:20:59,044 --> 00:21:02,344
- So, does anybody wanna sit on it?
- Yeah!

307
00:21:02,449 --> 00:21:05,941
- Okay, Ramona, let's hear it.
- Why, thank you, Mrs. Meacham.

308
00:21:14,226 --> 00:21:16,923
- Shh.

309
00:21:18,864 --> 00:21:22,300
Mute button. Mute button.
What am I doing? I'm muting you.

310
00:21:22,401 --> 00:21:24,232
Ramona, go on.

311
00:21:24,336 --> 00:21:27,499
Well, the most special thing in my life...

312
00:21:27,606 --> 00:21:30,632
is that some nice workmen in blue helmets...

313
00:21:30,743 --> 00:21:32,574
- came to my house this week-
- Shh.

314
00:21:32,678 --> 00:21:36,136
- and chopped a great big hole in it.

315
00:21:37,483 --> 00:21:39,781
But-But they did.

316
00:21:39,885 --> 00:21:42,911
It was so big, I could see all of Portland.

317
00:21:45,057 --> 00:21:47,787
Howie knows.
Howie came and jumped through the hole.

318
00:21:47,893 --> 00:21:49,724
Um-

319
00:21:49,827 --> 00:21:51,159
He did.

320
00:21:51,262 --> 00:21:53,730
- That's enough now.

321
00:21:53,831 --> 00:21:56,265
- I think the hole's in her head.

322
00:21:56,367 --> 00:21:58,267
- Show's over, Ramona.
- She's such a liar.

323
00:21:58,369 --> 00:22:00,462
- Mrs. Meacham, I'm not lying.
- Take your seat.

324
00:22:00,572 --> 00:22:04,633
Go ahead. Take your seat. The purpose
of this exercise is not to entertain us.

325
00:22:04,742 --> 00:22:07,643
No embellishments, please.

326
00:22:07,745 --> 00:22:10,179
Now, who would like to go next? Hands?

327
00:22:11,749 --> 00:22:13,877
You saw them chop the hole in my house.

328
00:22:13,985 --> 00:22:17,944
Actually, no. They pried it with crowbars.

329
00:22:18,056 --> 00:22:21,082
Technically, they pried it.

330
00:22:21,192 --> 00:22:23,217
That's what I meant.

331
00:22:23,328 --> 00:22:25,387
Now Mrs. Meacham thinks I'm a liar...

332
00:22:25,496 --> 00:22:28,363
and she's gonna tell my mom and dad
I'm a big troublemaker tonight.

333
00:22:28,466 --> 00:22:30,366
Well, you are sometimes.

334
00:22:30,468 --> 00:22:32,766
I mean, technically, you are.

335
00:22:32,869 --> 00:22:35,338
Maybe you should technically look
for a new best frlend.

336
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,841
- Hey! How you doing there, chief?

337
00:22:38,943 --> 00:22:40,808
Who's your girlfrlend?

338
00:22:40,912 --> 00:22:43,005
G- I'm not his girlfrlend.

339
00:22:43,114 --> 00:22:46,379
She's not my girlfrlend.
She's Ramona, and she lives over there.

340
00:22:46,484 --> 00:22:48,577
Ramona.

341
00:22:48,685 --> 00:22:52,747
# Ramona and Howie are sitting in a tree #

342
00:22:52,856 --> 00:22:55,485
# They are K-l-S-S-l-N-G ##

343
00:22:56,094 --> 00:22:57,925
Wait a second.

344
00:22:58,028 --> 00:23:00,122
Ramona Quimby? Huh.

345
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:02,960
Hey, I'm Hobart. I'm Howie's favorite uncle.

346
00:23:03,066 --> 00:23:04,897
No? Oh. Sorry.

347
00:23:05,002 --> 00:23:08,494
Yeah. We all heard about it.

348
00:23:08,605 --> 00:23:12,405
Oh, really? Well, how's that beautiful
Aunt Beatrice of yours doing?

349
00:23:12,509 --> 00:23:16,570
You be sure to tell her I'd love to catch up,
all right?

350
00:23:19,316 --> 00:23:21,647
Hey, Howie, how'd the saddle work out?

351
00:23:21,752 --> 00:23:23,686
Did you get an "A "?

352
00:23:27,524 --> 00:23:32,359
Dad? Does Aunt Bea really know
some weird guy named Hobart?

353
00:23:32,461 --> 00:23:35,920
Hobart? That's a name
I haven't heard in quite a while.

354
00:23:36,032 --> 00:23:39,489
Yeah, they were high school sweethearts,
old Hobart and Bea.

355
00:23:40,437 --> 00:23:43,770
Him? But he's not even her type.

356
00:23:43,874 --> 00:23:45,932
And what would that type be?

357
00:23:47,043 --> 00:23:48,202
Perfect.

358
00:23:50,479 --> 00:23:52,208
Hmm.

359
00:23:52,315 --> 00:23:54,748
Oh, I'm afraid to look. Bills, bills, bills.

360
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,943
It never ends, Pickle.

361
00:23:57,053 --> 00:23:59,043
Did you get the job today?

362
00:23:59,155 --> 00:24:02,556
- Well, I didn't get this one.
- Oh.

363
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:07,126
'Cause I was thinking.
I've got the perfect job.

364
00:24:07,229 --> 00:24:10,426
- What?
- You should be a fireman.

365
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:12,524
Oh. Yeah?

366
00:24:12,635 --> 00:24:15,432
Yes. You would save people's lives...

367
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:18,063
and climb gigantic ladders.

368
00:24:18,174 --> 00:24:20,437
And if it was a night alarm...

369
00:24:20,543 --> 00:24:23,774
you would get to put your fire suit on
over your pajamas.

370
00:24:23,878 --> 00:24:27,474
- Whoa.
- It's true, Dad. I took a field trip.

371
00:24:27,582 --> 00:24:29,915
Well, I wanna work in my pajamas...

372
00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:33,977
but I think you're overestimating
my job skills a little bit.

373
00:24:34,089 --> 00:24:35,715
I'm not that versatile.

374
00:24:36,524 --> 00:24:37,957
- Dad.
- What?

375
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:41,324
I think you can do anything. Don't you?

376
00:24:42,364 --> 00:24:44,058
Well-

377
00:24:44,165 --> 00:24:45,598
- Hi! I'm home!

378
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,464
- We need to be there by 5:00, honey.
- Oh.

379
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:52,132
I've heard those parent-teacher meetings
can be really boring.

380
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,401
They make your brain numb,
they're that boring.

381
00:24:54,509 --> 00:24:58,502
- Nice try, Ramona. We're going.
- Yeah. Good one, Pickle.

382
00:24:58,613 --> 00:25:01,309
Honey, I wanna call the bank tomorrow
and cancel the loan.

383
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:03,611
Bob, there's a gaping hole in the house.

384
00:25:03,718 --> 00:25:05,982
I don't think we have much choice.

385
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:09,454
We're in over our heads.
Let's wait till we're on our feet.

386
00:25:09,556 --> 00:25:12,116
Beezus, what are they talking about?

387
00:25:12,227 --> 00:25:14,319
- We just have to finish it.

388
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:17,592
Hey. And if we default? I'd rather sell it
than let the bank take the house.

389
00:25:17,699 --> 00:25:20,565
Bank take the house. Bank take the house.

390
00:26:04,745 --> 00:26:08,181
- Our house.

391
00:26:08,282 --> 00:26:10,409
- Can we just talk
about this later, Bob?
- Okay, fine.

392
00:26:10,516 --> 00:26:11,983
- We're late.
- Mom, wait.

393
00:26:12,085 --> 00:26:15,953
No more stalling. We're meeting with
Mrs. Meacham, end of story.

394
00:26:16,055 --> 00:26:17,716
- Hmm?
- Be good, lovelies.

395
00:26:17,824 --> 00:26:20,087
- Mwah!
- And be good for Aunt Bea tonight.

396
00:26:20,193 --> 00:26:22,183
We're off to numb our brains.

397
00:26:23,763 --> 00:26:26,357
Beezus, where's the bank
gonna take our house?

398
00:26:26,466 --> 00:26:29,832
It's just an expression, genius.
They don't take it anywhere.

399
00:26:29,936 --> 00:26:32,336
- Oh.
- They just sell it to someone else.

400
00:26:32,438 --> 00:26:34,133
- What?

401
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,730
- I got it.

402
00:26:35,841 --> 00:26:38,571
- Hello. Oh, hi, Henry.
- Beezus, we can't move.

403
00:26:38,678 --> 00:26:40,976
This is our house. We belong here.

404
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,048
I-I don't want us
to leave Klickitat Street.

405
00:26:43,149 --> 00:26:45,117
Ramona, I am on the phone.

406
00:26:50,323 --> 00:26:52,553
Aunt Bea!

407
00:26:52,657 --> 00:26:56,024
- Can I- Can I ask you something?
- Shh. Just a minute, babe.

408
00:27:01,032 --> 00:27:06,060
- What's wrong?
- I just thought
I recognized someone out there.

409
00:27:06,172 --> 00:27:09,266
Oh. You mean Hobart. Hmm.

410
00:27:09,374 --> 00:27:11,639
Sounds like you've met him.

411
00:27:11,743 --> 00:27:13,643
He said he wants to catch up with you.

412
00:27:13,745 --> 00:27:15,373
You're kidding.

413
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,277
- He said that to you?
- Mm-hmm.

414
00:27:17,382 --> 00:27:20,910
Well, that's just- That's just classic.

415
00:27:28,026 --> 00:27:31,484
Aunt Bea, can I ask you something?

416
00:27:31,596 --> 00:27:33,826
I think the bank's gonna take our house.

417
00:27:35,333 --> 00:27:37,699
- Aunt Bea?
- Huh?

418
00:27:37,802 --> 00:27:39,929
- Are you listening?
- Hmm?

419
00:27:40,038 --> 00:27:42,165
Oh. I'm sorry.

420
00:27:42,273 --> 00:27:45,208
I just-
How do I put this?

421
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:49,075
- Um, you know those calluses on your hands?
- Yeah.

422
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:53,480
Mm-hmm. How the skin gets tough
to protect a spot that got hurt?

423
00:27:53,585 --> 00:27:56,850
I have one of those on my heart
from a really long time ago.

424
00:27:56,954 --> 00:27:59,753
And if he thinks he can just come back here
and start picking at it...

425
00:27:59,858 --> 00:28:01,758
he is sadly mistaken.

426
00:28:05,429 --> 00:28:08,593
I guess you're the only one left to talk to.

427
00:28:08,699 --> 00:28:11,498
I'm sorry for pulling your tail
when I was little...

428
00:28:11,602 --> 00:28:15,265
and for trying to teach you
how to play catch...

429
00:28:15,372 --> 00:28:17,636
and for dressing you up as an astronaut.

430
00:28:17,741 --> 00:28:20,073
- I know you're really old...

431
00:28:20,177 --> 00:28:22,145
so I'm gonna say this gently.

432
00:28:22,246 --> 00:28:24,544
We're in a lot of trouble, Picky Picky.

433
00:28:24,648 --> 00:28:26,582
We need money.

434
00:28:26,684 --> 00:28:28,675
And we might lose our house.

435
00:28:28,786 --> 00:28:30,776
- But don't worry, okay?

436
00:28:30,888 --> 00:28:33,288
I'm gonna help.

437
00:28:33,389 --> 00:28:36,290
Nobody thinks I can, but I can.

438
00:28:37,327 --> 00:28:39,386
I can be extraordinary.

439
00:28:39,495 --> 00:28:42,862
- I'm glad we agree.

440
00:28:47,504 --> 00:28:49,199
Whoa.

441
00:28:49,305 --> 00:28:51,831
Whoo!

442
00:28:53,243 --> 00:28:54,641
Whoo!

443
00:29:01,818 --> 00:29:05,219
Ramona, why is my desk on the lawn?

444
00:29:05,321 --> 00:29:07,289
It's a secret.

445
00:29:08,858 --> 00:29:12,817
Okay, fine. I'll tell you.
I'm saving the house for Mom and Dad.

446
00:29:12,929 --> 00:29:15,762
Is that Great-Grandma's crystal?

447
00:29:15,865 --> 00:29:17,765
Ramona, we never use that.

448
00:29:17,867 --> 00:29:20,836
I know. We're gonna make
so much money today, Beezus.

449
00:29:20,937 --> 00:29:23,064
Now, if you wanna join the team...

450
00:29:23,171 --> 00:29:26,699
I could always use
a hard-working sales assoclate.

451
00:29:28,877 --> 00:29:31,938
Um, is that "delicious"?

452
00:29:33,583 --> 00:29:35,277
- Mm-hmm!
- Ah.

453
00:29:35,384 --> 00:29:37,112
Ooh! Customer!

454
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,710
Customer!

455
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,789
Ramona, please, please, please,
don't call him over-

456
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:44,324
Hey, Henry, you look thirsty!

457
00:29:44,426 --> 00:29:46,326
- Hi.
- Hi, Henry.

458
00:29:47,362 --> 00:29:49,193
Hey, Beezus.

459
00:29:49,298 --> 00:29:51,561
Hi.

460
00:29:53,035 --> 00:29:56,299
- Selling lemonade?
- Yeah. Just helping out my little sister.

461
00:29:57,472 --> 00:29:59,702
- Like the uniform?

462
00:29:59,808 --> 00:30:01,400
Well, the last time I saw you in pajamas...

463
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,444
we were playing sheep
in the Christmas pageant.

464
00:30:03,545 --> 00:30:06,309
But, yeah, it's a good look for you.

465
00:30:06,414 --> 00:30:10,043
Huh. Right. Yeah. Baa! Baa!

466
00:30:13,255 --> 00:30:16,246
But I think you spilled something
on your shirt there.

467
00:30:16,358 --> 00:30:19,555
- Oh.
- Gotcha.

468
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:27,562
Hello!
Delicious lemonade, anyone?

469
00:30:27,668 --> 00:30:29,660
I- Yeah, I'll have one.

470
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:31,237
- You will?
- Yeah.

471
00:30:31,339 --> 00:30:34,501
Well, that'll be one dollar, please.
Exact change preferred.

472
00:30:34,609 --> 00:30:36,872
Oh, Ramona, Henry doesn't have to pay.

473
00:30:36,978 --> 00:30:39,775
- Beezus, it's for the house.
- Uh, she meant "on the house."

474
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,644
No charge. Here.

475
00:30:41,749 --> 00:30:43,774
- But, Beezus-
- Thank you.

476
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:45,818
- Beezus!
- Shh.

477
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,081
- Beezus!

478
00:30:48,189 --> 00:30:50,487
- I said, shh.
- But, Beezus-

479
00:30:51,259 --> 00:30:53,351
That won't taste-

480
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,791
good.

481
00:30:55,796 --> 00:30:57,262
Oh!

482
00:31:01,969 --> 00:31:03,493
She's right.

483
00:31:03,604 --> 00:31:05,662
No charge for that.

484
00:31:05,773 --> 00:31:08,867
I wanna die! Just let me die!

485
00:31:08,975 --> 00:31:10,841
I hate my life!

486
00:31:10,945 --> 00:31:13,936
- Beezus?
- No. Go away.

487
00:31:14,048 --> 00:31:16,676
Get out. Get out.

488
00:31:16,784 --> 00:31:20,345
But... what did I do that was so bad?

489
00:31:20,453 --> 00:31:22,854
You embarrassed me in front of Henry.

490
00:31:22,957 --> 00:31:26,222
If I didn't know better, I'd swear you were
actually trying to ruin my life.

491
00:31:26,326 --> 00:31:29,989
You run around like a nutball.
You don't care what anybody thinks.

492
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:33,293
And you even stuck me
with my stupid nickname.

493
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,390
But I was just a baby then...

494
00:31:35,501 --> 00:31:37,492
and I meant to call you Beatrice.

495
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:40,630
It just came out... wrong.

496
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:43,265
Yeah, tell me about it.

497
00:31:43,376 --> 00:31:46,675
How can I be normal with a name like Beezus?

498
00:31:48,348 --> 00:31:50,508
Who could ever love a girl named Beezus?

499
00:31:52,151 --> 00:31:53,641
Jesus?

500
00:31:54,554 --> 00:31:55,851
Get out!

501
00:32:02,095 --> 00:32:05,189
Mrs. Pitt, would you care
for a car wash today?

502
00:32:05,297 --> 00:32:07,163
My car is in the shop today, dearie.

503
00:32:07,267 --> 00:32:09,360
- Wash your car?
- Just washed it myself.

504
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,868
Please let me wash your car, please!

505
00:32:14,306 --> 00:32:16,331
Are you the pizza man?

506
00:32:16,442 --> 00:32:17,669
No.

507
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,585
Hey, babe.

508
00:32:30,689 --> 00:32:31,678
Hey.

509
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:33,690
How's business?

510
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:36,555
- I'm considering retirement.

511
00:32:36,662 --> 00:32:41,121
Ramona's not a quitter.

512
00:32:42,067 --> 00:32:44,092
Mwah!

513
00:32:44,202 --> 00:32:48,467
- Is he still out there?

514
00:32:48,573 --> 00:32:52,532
Doesn't he have anything better to do than
tinker with his precious Jeep?

515
00:32:52,643 --> 00:32:54,372
Oh, look at him.

516
00:32:54,479 --> 00:32:58,812
He thinks he can flash
those hazel eyes and that smug little smile...

517
00:32:58,916 --> 00:33:01,317
and just reel me back in again.

518
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,717
- Reel you back in?
- Yeah.

519
00:33:03,821 --> 00:33:06,381
- Like a sea bass.
- Ew.

520
00:33:06,491 --> 00:33:10,085
- I know. Exactly.

521
00:33:10,194 --> 00:33:12,321
Here's what we do.

522
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:14,330
We head straight to the house...

523
00:33:14,432 --> 00:33:16,593
looking confident and radiant...

524
00:33:16,701 --> 00:33:20,159
so Hobart gets a good look at everything
he missed out on, okay?

525
00:33:20,271 --> 00:33:22,501
- Okay.
- I'm so glad I wore my good jeans.

526
00:33:22,606 --> 00:33:24,938
- Ready to strut?
- I think so.

527
00:33:25,043 --> 00:33:28,102
- Hmm.
- But what if he tries to talk to us?

528
00:33:28,212 --> 00:33:30,544
- We ignore him.
- Got it.

529
00:33:30,648 --> 00:33:33,344
- Strut and ignore.
- Mm-hmm.

530
00:33:36,487 --> 00:33:38,387
Mm-mmm!

531
00:33:38,488 --> 00:33:40,116
Keep up the good work.

532
00:33:40,223 --> 00:33:42,192
- Mm-mmm-mmm.
- Mm-mmm.

533
00:33:42,293 --> 00:33:45,319
- Excuse me.
- Oh!

534
00:33:49,132 --> 00:33:50,793
Good, Bea. Real smooth.

535
00:33:50,901 --> 00:33:52,868
How are you doing there, Beatrice?

536
00:33:54,404 --> 00:33:56,839
- You got a little-
- No.

537
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,841
You gotta watch out for that cross traffic,
ladies. What's the rush?

538
00:33:59,943 --> 00:34:01,968
We're ignoring you.

539
00:34:02,078 --> 00:34:04,308
Now, why would you wanna do that?

540
00:34:04,414 --> 00:34:07,975
So nobody gets reeled in like a sea bass.

541
00:34:08,085 --> 00:34:10,712
- Oh! Like the fish?
- Mm-hmm.

542
00:34:10,821 --> 00:34:14,483
Huh. Well, we'll make sure
that doesn't happen.

543
00:34:14,591 --> 00:34:18,027
But it would be nice to find some time
to catch up with your Aunt Bea.

544
00:34:19,629 --> 00:34:22,029
I think we just did. Excuse us.

545
00:34:25,235 --> 00:34:27,362
Keep struttin', Aunt Bea. You're doing good.

546
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:29,301
Hey, Ramona!

547
00:34:29,406 --> 00:34:32,068
That Jeep of mine could sure use a wash,
don't you think?

548
00:34:32,174 --> 00:34:35,406
The poor thing's been sitting in the garage
for 15 years now, Bea?

549
00:34:35,512 --> 00:34:37,139
How much to hose her off?

550
00:34:41,083 --> 00:34:42,550
Fifty dollars.

551
00:34:42,651 --> 00:34:45,211
- Fifty d- No. No, no, no.
- Mm-hmm.

552
00:34:45,321 --> 00:34:47,881
No, I would never take advantage
of you like that, Ramona.

553
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:50,152
That Jeep is my pride and joy.

554
00:34:50,259 --> 00:34:53,820
For you to wash it,
and a "delishus" custom hand-wash at that...

555
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:55,829
I'm gonna have to insist on, uh-

556
00:34:55,931 --> 00:34:59,367
I don't know- an even... hundred bucks?

557
00:34:59,468 --> 00:35:01,026
Really?

558
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,240
Yeah. Really. Not a penny less.

559
00:35:07,342 --> 00:35:09,173
One hundred dollars?

560
00:35:09,278 --> 00:35:11,007
- Yeah.
- Whoo!

561
00:35:11,113 --> 00:35:13,342
Oh, just, uh, one little condition.

562
00:35:13,449 --> 00:35:15,383
Bea gets to chat with me.

563
00:35:15,484 --> 00:35:17,883
Yeah, we can sit inside,
like the old car washes.

564
00:35:17,986 --> 00:35:20,181
- What do you say, Bea?

565
00:35:20,289 --> 00:35:22,222
Like I said, it'd be nice to catch up.

566
00:35:22,323 --> 00:35:23,723
Please, please, please.

567
00:35:27,595 --> 00:35:29,722
How fast can you wash his car?

568
00:35:34,335 --> 00:35:36,803
- Milady.
- Huh. I'm regretting this already.

569
00:35:38,806 --> 00:35:40,706
- Oh.

570
00:35:48,917 --> 00:35:50,816
It's like time stood still in here.

571
00:35:50,919 --> 00:35:53,409
- I'd swear I was back in high school.
- Mm-hmm.

572
00:35:53,521 --> 00:35:55,922
- The good old days.

573
00:35:56,991 --> 00:35:59,221
I wouldn't mind going back for a while.

574
00:35:59,327 --> 00:36:03,127
Maybe I could, you know,
figure out where I messed up.

575
00:36:03,231 --> 00:36:05,631
Oh, ancient history. I've moved on.

576
00:36:05,732 --> 00:36:08,065
Yeah, I'll say.

577
00:36:11,939 --> 00:36:13,930
Back off, Romeo.

578
00:36:14,041 --> 00:36:16,133
- I think she likes me.

579
00:36:16,244 --> 00:36:18,234
Don't bet on it.

580
00:36:18,346 --> 00:36:19,779
Stay cool, Aunt Bea.

581
00:36:19,881 --> 00:36:23,816
So I'll be heading off to Alaska
in a few weeks.

582
00:36:23,917 --> 00:36:27,182
After I get this thing up and running,
I am back on the road...

583
00:36:27,287 --> 00:36:30,621
and out of your hair for the next few years.

584
00:36:30,724 --> 00:36:33,488
Well, my hair thanks you.

585
00:36:33,594 --> 00:36:35,493
But it was inspired of you...

586
00:36:35,596 --> 00:36:38,758
bribing my niece just to talk to me,
Mr. Moneybags.

587
00:36:38,865 --> 00:36:40,264
Well, a hundred bucks is a bargain.

588
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:43,825
Between you and me,
I was willing to go much higher.

589
00:36:43,937 --> 00:36:46,906
Oh, really?
Times have changed.

590
00:36:48,341 --> 00:36:50,935
This from the guy who bought me a ring
for my sweet 16...

591
00:36:51,044 --> 00:36:53,012
straight from a gum ball machine.

592
00:36:53,113 --> 00:36:56,674
- Oh, yeah. That's right.
- I even had to lend you the quarter.

593
00:36:59,619 --> 00:37:02,519
Let's face it.
I wanted that ring to be real.

594
00:37:02,622 --> 00:37:04,521
You always knew it was disposable.

595
00:37:04,624 --> 00:37:06,352
Just you and me in a nutshell.

596
00:37:06,459 --> 00:37:08,051
Yeah.

597
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,129
Coming through. Ooh!

598
00:37:12,798 --> 00:37:14,698
What do we have here?

599
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,631
Oh, no!

600
00:37:16,736 --> 00:37:18,761
- "You and Me Forever Mix"?
- Oh, Hobart!

601
00:37:18,871 --> 00:37:21,635
Could these be the romantic stylings
of the young Beatrice?

602
00:37:21,741 --> 00:37:23,799
Oh, don't play it.
Oh, Hobart, that's embarrassing.

603
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:25,809
- Please don't play it.
- Of course I'm gonna play it.

604
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:29,005
- This is so embarrassing.

605
00:37:29,115 --> 00:37:30,741
Uh-uh.

606
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:32,680
Oh!

607
00:37:57,842 --> 00:37:59,708
Howie, help!

608
00:37:59,812 --> 00:38:02,440
She's getting reeled in. Whoo!

609
00:38:02,547 --> 00:38:04,072
- Howie!
- Ramona!

610
00:38:04,182 --> 00:38:05,945
She's getting reeled in!

611
00:38:08,988 --> 00:38:10,421
Oh, oh, oh!

612
00:38:10,522 --> 00:38:12,682
Hobart, do something!

613
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:27,437
- I'm afraid to look.

614
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:41,283
No, no, no.
The surface was wet. He tried hosing it off.

615
00:38:41,386 --> 00:38:45,446
How do we get it off
without damaging the paint job underneath?

616
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:47,456
And if we bring it in, how much?

617
00:38:47,558 --> 00:38:49,321
Ballpark?

618
00:38:49,426 --> 00:38:51,257
What is that, hundreds?

619
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:54,490
- Thousands?
- No. No. Try this guy.

620
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:57,500
Well, this is gonna cost us a fortune.

621
00:38:57,601 --> 00:38:59,570
Hello. I'd- Yes, I'll hold.

622
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:04,101
I- I'm so sorry.

623
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:07,008
It's all my fault.

624
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,441
- You're sorry?
- Mm-hmm.

625
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:18,010
Uh, I'm sorry, because now
that I'm looking at it from a distance...

626
00:39:18,121 --> 00:39:20,589
I realize that I should be thanking you.

627
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:24,092
I mean, look at it. It's- It's camouflaged.

628
00:39:24,194 --> 00:39:28,096
And from what I hear,
the icy Alaskan terrain looks-

629
00:39:28,197 --> 00:39:30,098
looks just like that.

630
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:32,497
So I can just sneak right
up on those polar bears.

631
00:39:32,602 --> 00:39:35,093
I don't even have to get out of my Jeep.

632
00:39:36,506 --> 00:39:40,374
Well, I'm- I'm glad you like it?

633
00:39:40,476 --> 00:39:42,376
- I love it.
- Hey, Hobart, are you crazy?

634
00:39:42,478 --> 00:39:44,673
- You're not gonna leave it like that.
- No, no, no. No, no.

635
00:39:44,781 --> 00:39:48,615
I paid for something "delishus,"
and look what I got- an Easter egg.

636
00:39:50,053 --> 00:39:52,180
What do you think, Bea?

637
00:39:52,288 --> 00:39:54,222
That a good look for me?

638
00:39:55,725 --> 00:39:57,284
Hmm.

639
00:39:59,395 --> 00:40:01,295
Sure.

640
00:40:01,397 --> 00:40:04,560
It might even bring out your sensitive side.

641
00:40:09,805 --> 00:40:11,773
Next time we clean the neighbor's garage...

642
00:40:11,874 --> 00:40:14,638
it's coming out of your allowance,
not mine, Picasso.

643
00:40:14,744 --> 00:40:16,711
For your records, my dear.

644
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,242
Now I have less money than I started with...

645
00:40:21,349 --> 00:40:22,839
and I started with zero.

646
00:40:22,952 --> 00:40:25,512
How about you focus
on things around the house instead?

647
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:29,421
Like being a good helper,
getting along with your sisters.

648
00:40:29,524 --> 00:40:31,549
I can feed Roberta, Mommy.

649
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:33,560
Don't worry about a thing. I'll do it.

650
00:40:33,662 --> 00:40:35,993
Here's the peas and a spoon.
Work some magic.

651
00:40:36,098 --> 00:40:37,997
That's my girl.

652
00:40:40,403 --> 00:40:42,496
Ooh, look!

653
00:40:42,604 --> 00:40:47,042
Here comes the... intergalactic space lava.

654
00:40:47,142 --> 00:40:50,543
Ramona, she's an infant. She doesn't know
what intergalactic space lava is.

655
00:40:50,645 --> 00:40:53,113
- I don't even know what that is.
- Oh, you butt out, Beez-

656
00:40:54,783 --> 00:41:00,551
Uh, I mean, thank you for your feedback.

657
00:41:00,655 --> 00:41:02,555
I love feedback.

658
00:41:04,826 --> 00:41:06,293
Love it.

659
00:41:07,562 --> 00:41:09,962
- Any progress today?

660
00:41:10,064 --> 00:41:15,468
Yeah. I, um- I got a couple of leads, but...

661
00:41:15,569 --> 00:41:18,539
I don't know
if I'm executive material anymore.

662
00:41:19,641 --> 00:41:21,541
Could be time to try something else.

663
00:41:21,643 --> 00:41:25,374
- Like what?
- Fireman! Fireman, fireman.

664
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,404
Fireman.

665
00:41:29,083 --> 00:41:31,347
I don't know.

666
00:41:31,453 --> 00:41:33,353
You know, something creative.

667
00:41:33,455 --> 00:41:35,719
Uh- I used to be a creative guy.

668
00:41:35,823 --> 00:41:37,724
Yeah, well...

669
00:41:37,825 --> 00:41:41,784
if you find a job that pays you
to be creative and have fun...

670
00:41:41,896 --> 00:41:43,829
then maybe you can give them my resume too.

671
00:41:49,336 --> 00:41:51,861
Guess what! It's picture day tomorrow.

672
00:41:51,972 --> 00:41:53,439
Oh! That's good.

673
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,508
Seeing your picture always cheers me up.

674
00:41:55,609 --> 00:41:57,906
Me too.

675
00:41:58,011 --> 00:42:01,378
And I'll make sure
it's the best picture ever, ever.

676
00:42:01,482 --> 00:42:03,609
It'll be... dazzling.

677
00:42:03,716 --> 00:42:05,480
We expect nothing less.

678
00:42:06,386 --> 00:42:08,081
Say "peas. "

679
00:42:08,188 --> 00:42:09,780
"Peas, please."

680
00:42:09,889 --> 00:42:12,757
Mom, I got Roberta to eat her peas.

681
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,691
Yummy peas.

682
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:21,291
- Hmm, hmm.

683
00:42:22,569 --> 00:42:24,433
That is disgus-

684
00:42:25,538 --> 00:42:27,438
I mean...

685
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:30,031
what a darling little sister.

686
00:42:30,142 --> 00:42:32,133
I wish there were 10 of you.

687
00:42:44,957 --> 00:42:46,720
"Royal Peanut Butter.

688
00:42:46,826 --> 00:42:50,125
There's a bit of magic in every jar."

689
00:42:50,229 --> 00:42:53,129
Is that one of your favorites?
That's the racket we gotta get you into.

690
00:42:53,232 --> 00:42:55,700
'Cause those TV kids make millions.

691
00:42:55,801 --> 00:42:58,496
Beezus, do you think
I could be in a commercial like that?

692
00:42:58,604 --> 00:43:00,867
- Sure. You'd make a great frog.

693
00:43:00,973 --> 00:43:03,806
- Hey.
- Hold still. I'm almost done.

694
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:06,208
It's picture perfect, right?

695
00:43:06,311 --> 00:43:08,245
Let's be realistic, Ramona.

696
00:43:08,347 --> 00:43:10,337
This is a curling iron, not a magic wand.

697
00:43:10,449 --> 00:43:14,407
But all things considered,
I'd say you've never looked better.

698
00:43:16,822 --> 00:43:19,051
I love it!

699
00:43:19,157 --> 00:43:21,057
Thanks, Beezus.

700
00:43:22,327 --> 00:43:23,294
Ribbit!

701
00:43:25,964 --> 00:43:29,092
How your mom kept things
running so smooth beats me.

702
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,225
Dad, since the room's almost done...

703
00:43:31,336 --> 00:43:33,327
have you decided
who's gonna get it for sure?

704
00:43:34,439 --> 00:43:37,067
Why? You know somebody who's interested?

705
00:43:37,174 --> 00:43:38,870
Mm-hmm.

706
00:43:38,977 --> 00:43:43,209
Okay, let me think about it,
'cause I like your persistence.

707
00:43:43,315 --> 00:43:45,544
Yes. The answer's still no.

708
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:46,582
Okay.

709
00:43:54,158 --> 00:43:56,855
Wow. You are definitely dazzling, Pickle.

710
00:43:56,962 --> 00:43:59,760
- all right, go smile big and make us proud.
- Bye, Dad.

711
00:43:59,864 --> 00:44:02,890
- Bye, Beezus. Bye, Roberta.

712
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,025
So I'm gonna take this...

713
00:44:05,136 --> 00:44:08,298
and stick it right in the mouth
to make it look like fire.

714
00:44:11,042 --> 00:44:14,499
Whoa. You look fancy, Susan.

715
00:44:14,612 --> 00:44:17,376
My mother helped me pick out
the perfect ensemble.

716
00:44:17,481 --> 00:44:20,416
She's in real estate, so she knows
a little something about presentation.

717
00:44:20,517 --> 00:44:23,315
She could help you too, Ramona,
if you want a consultation.

718
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:26,651
- My mom lets me pick out my own clothes.
- We can tell.

719
00:44:31,161 --> 00:44:33,128
Excuse me. What are you doing?

720
00:44:33,229 --> 00:44:36,495
I'm loading my grape-a-pult. Watch and learn.

721
00:44:37,835 --> 00:44:40,132
And what was the purpose of that?

722
00:44:40,236 --> 00:44:42,637
The question is, can anybody top it?

723
00:44:44,174 --> 00:44:47,336
Have you ever seen the proper way
to crack a hard-boiled egg?

724
00:44:47,444 --> 00:44:50,004
Take notes if you want to, Susan.

725
00:45:04,594 --> 00:45:07,495
- Say cheese.

726
00:45:07,597 --> 00:45:09,087
Next.

727
00:45:09,198 --> 00:45:11,291
- Say "cheese."
- Better just smile then, nice and big.

728
00:45:11,401 --> 00:45:12,698
Next.

729
00:45:14,137 --> 00:45:16,196
- Say "cheese."
- Egg in her hair?

730
00:45:16,305 --> 00:45:18,205
- That's a new one.

731
00:45:18,307 --> 00:45:20,274
- Next.

732
00:45:21,377 --> 00:45:23,811
- Say "cheese."
- Cheese.

733
00:45:24,947 --> 00:45:27,472
How come you always tell us to say "cheese"?

734
00:45:27,583 --> 00:45:31,075
- Don't you get tired of "cheese"?
- As a matter of fact, I do.

735
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:33,313
- Next.

736
00:45:36,426 --> 00:45:39,826
- Say... "peas."
- Ew!

737
00:45:42,131 --> 00:45:44,189
Just when you thought
it was safe to open the mail.

738
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:50,865
I'm sorry about that raw egg, kiddo.

739
00:45:50,972 --> 00:45:52,531
I guess I really messed that one up.

740
00:45:52,641 --> 00:45:55,542
- I look like a troll.
- No, you don't.

741
00:45:55,644 --> 00:45:57,544
Yeah, she totally does.

742
00:45:57,646 --> 00:45:59,877
Hey. Maybe it's not "terrifical. "

743
00:45:59,981 --> 00:46:03,212
But this is definitely a keeper.
This is going in my wallet.

744
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:08,518
Come on. You wanna help me fold?

745
00:46:08,623 --> 00:46:12,422
I'd just mess it up, Dad.
Admit it. I'm a nuisance.

746
00:46:12,527 --> 00:46:16,896
- You are not a nuisance.
- Mrs. Meacham says I'm a nuisance.

747
00:46:16,998 --> 00:46:19,831
- And she's a professional.
- You know what I think?

748
00:46:19,935 --> 00:46:23,371
You just have so much energy,
sometimes it gets away from you.

749
00:46:23,472 --> 00:46:25,405
I'm not saying that energy's bad.

750
00:46:25,506 --> 00:46:27,531
It's just you gotta learn how to control it.

751
00:46:27,642 --> 00:46:30,202
I mean, come on, let's be honest here.

752
00:46:30,311 --> 00:46:33,281
Two months ago, you couldn't trust me
with the laundry, and now?

753
00:46:33,381 --> 00:46:35,439
- Doesn't that look good?
- Yeah.

754
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:38,712
Yeah. all right.
You just gotta try, kiddo.

755
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:41,219
We're both gonna turn this around.

756
00:46:41,322 --> 00:46:43,222
Just keep trying, kiddo.

757
00:46:43,324 --> 00:46:45,292
- Okay.
- That's my girl!

758
00:47:08,048 --> 00:47:12,610
- Hey. Whoa! Let me help you there.

759
00:47:15,555 --> 00:47:17,421
- Morning doughnut.

760
00:47:24,197 --> 00:47:25,722
- Whoa!
- Oh!

761
00:47:25,832 --> 00:47:27,892
- Who would like to put this up?

762
00:47:28,001 --> 00:47:31,596
- And what does that spell?
- Delicious.

763
00:47:31,705 --> 00:47:35,470
Bye!
I'll miss you guys!

764
00:47:38,245 --> 00:47:40,805
- Whoo!

765
00:47:40,914 --> 00:47:43,644
Sweetie, you should come
and celebrate with us.

766
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:46,412
- What am I celebrating?
- Well, you've been working so hard...

767
00:47:46,519 --> 00:47:50,285
we thought you'd be kind of excited
about getting your own room.

768
00:47:56,695 --> 00:48:00,496
T-minus three, two, one, blastoff!

769
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:23,053
- Ramona!

770
00:48:23,155 --> 00:48:26,454
Stop making so much noise.

771
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:28,549
Sorry. I'm just enjoying my new room.

772
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:31,060
Stop gloating. It's not polite.

773
00:48:31,163 --> 00:48:33,996
I'm not gloating. I'm bouncing.

774
00:48:34,099 --> 00:48:37,193
Well, if you want your junk,
you better go grab it now.

775
00:48:37,302 --> 00:48:39,566
Anything left over goes to Goodwill.

776
00:48:40,606 --> 00:48:43,166
Remember me, Ramona? Baa!

777
00:48:43,275 --> 00:48:45,072
- Stop!
- Help me!

778
00:48:45,177 --> 00:48:47,008
Give it back.

779
00:48:47,111 --> 00:48:49,376
- Baa!
- Give it back.

780
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:51,846
- So, what do you think?

781
00:48:54,919 --> 00:48:56,478
Uh. That's far enough.

782
00:48:56,588 --> 00:48:59,385
This is a no-pest zone.

783
00:49:01,894 --> 00:49:05,488
Well, who needs you...
or your dumb teenager room?

784
00:49:05,597 --> 00:49:10,056
- I like it by myself.
- Uh-huh. Sure you do.

785
00:49:10,168 --> 00:49:13,659
When the lights go out,
and then you start thinking...

786
00:49:13,771 --> 00:49:17,902
about all the noises and the monsters...

787
00:49:18,009 --> 00:49:21,809
and then you realize
you didn't check under your bed...

788
00:49:21,913 --> 00:49:23,574
not carefully...

789
00:49:23,681 --> 00:49:25,672
don't come knocking on my door.

790
00:49:27,218 --> 00:49:29,709
If you make it that far.

791
00:49:42,667 --> 00:49:46,296
- Slithering beast...

792
00:49:46,404 --> 00:49:51,307
that feeds on pests with bad report cards.

793
00:50:02,786 --> 00:50:04,378
Picky Picky?

794
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:18,959
Ramona, come on. Let's go. We're late.

795
00:50:19,069 --> 00:50:22,732
Dad, what's another word for "sick"?

796
00:50:22,838 --> 00:50:25,671
Um, queasy? Nauseous?

797
00:50:25,775 --> 00:50:27,834
Like really, really sick?

798
00:50:27,944 --> 00:50:29,741
Oh. Bilious.

799
00:50:29,845 --> 00:50:32,575
Dad, I feel bilious.

800
00:50:32,682 --> 00:50:36,550
I don't think school's a good call right now.

801
00:50:38,854 --> 00:50:43,052
Oh. You're in a suit.
Do you have an interview?

802
00:50:43,159 --> 00:50:45,650
Well, yeah,
but I can change it if we have to.

803
00:50:45,761 --> 00:50:48,753
Are you queasy sick or achy sick?

804
00:50:49,865 --> 00:50:53,996
Well, I'm kind of feeling better now.

805
00:50:54,103 --> 00:50:55,627
You sure?

806
00:50:55,738 --> 00:50:58,866
Okay, well, let's go.
We got, like, 60 seconds.

807
00:50:58,975 --> 00:51:00,874
- Fast, like a fireman.

808
00:51:00,977 --> 00:51:03,103
59, 58...

809
00:51:03,212 --> 00:51:05,237
57- Come on.

810
00:51:05,347 --> 00:51:08,441
- 56, 55-

811
00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:10,450
54-

812
00:51:12,788 --> 00:51:15,255
- Bye, Dad!
- Bye!

813
00:51:20,428 --> 00:51:22,896
Hey, Ramona!
You've gotta see this. Come on.

814
00:51:22,998 --> 00:51:25,694
- What?
- Come on. Come on, come on, come on.

815
00:51:26,968 --> 00:51:29,130
Here. Check this out.

816
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:36,836
- Hobart!
- Yeah?

817
00:51:36,945 --> 00:51:39,469
Mind where you're digging.

818
00:51:39,581 --> 00:51:42,243
We've got sprinkler pipes down there.

819
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:45,047
Oh, is that what I keep hitting?

820
00:51:45,153 --> 00:51:47,486
Don't worry, Mom. Relax. It's okay.

821
00:51:47,588 --> 00:51:49,988
Oh!

822
00:51:50,091 --> 00:51:52,059
- Good talk.
- What do you think he's doing?

823
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:55,391
Maybe he's digging
a secret tunnel to Istanbul.

824
00:51:55,496 --> 00:51:59,330
A spy network right through
your very own backyard.

825
00:51:59,434 --> 00:52:03,837
Or maybe this house was built
on an old burial ground...

826
00:52:03,937 --> 00:52:06,406
and I'm unlocking an ancient curse.

827
00:52:16,918 --> 00:52:20,354
Open call?
That means anybody can audition, right?

828
00:52:20,455 --> 00:52:22,355
Mm-hmm.

829
00:52:22,457 --> 00:52:26,688
Ramona, they don't want just anybody.
They want a princess.

830
00:52:26,794 --> 00:52:29,456
- A million dollars.
- Take out your instruments. Good.

831
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:32,897
all right. Grab a seat, kids.
Let's shake this rust out and start jammin'.

832
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,400
One, two, three, four.

833
00:52:37,805 --> 00:52:40,272
Yeah! Yeah, you guys are tight!

834
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:10,895
Ramona!

835
00:53:11,003 --> 00:53:12,938
Why did you do that?

836
00:53:13,039 --> 00:53:16,133
I can't help it. They're mesmerizing.

837
00:53:16,242 --> 00:53:19,803
But you've been doing it since kindergarten,
and it's getting old.

838
00:53:19,912 --> 00:53:22,403
Look, I know things must be rough at home...

839
00:53:22,515 --> 00:53:24,642
but don't take it out on my curls.

840
00:53:24,751 --> 00:53:27,981
Okay. Hold on a second, guys. That was good.

841
00:53:28,087 --> 00:53:30,055
That was almost the song.

842
00:53:30,156 --> 00:53:34,820
So, um, guitars, quick rehearsal.
Everybody else, take five.

843
00:53:34,927 --> 00:53:37,191
Ramona!

844
00:53:37,296 --> 00:53:40,857
What was that about? "Rough at home"?

845
00:53:40,966 --> 00:53:44,766
- Well, your dad lost his job, didn't he?
- Maybe.

846
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:47,862
Look, when people lose their jobs, you know,
they start fighting...

847
00:53:47,973 --> 00:53:50,941
and then they get a divorce
and sell their houses.

848
00:53:51,042 --> 00:53:53,772
It's textbook.
Look at the bright side, Ramona.

849
00:53:53,879 --> 00:53:57,110
I mean, after my dad got laid off,
my mom sold her house...

850
00:53:57,215 --> 00:53:59,480
got a real estate license, so there's a plus.

851
00:53:59,584 --> 00:54:02,816
And then my dad got a new car
and moved to Tacoma.

852
00:54:02,922 --> 00:54:04,513
Tacoma?

853
00:54:06,658 --> 00:54:09,024
Susan, I'm so sorry.

854
00:54:09,127 --> 00:54:12,858
Well, now on my birthdays,
they both give me checks, so it works out.

855
00:54:15,567 --> 00:54:18,297
Okay.

856
00:54:21,807 --> 00:54:24,536
Hey, Ramona?
Would you mind taking your seat again?

857
00:54:24,642 --> 00:54:27,304
What are you doing by the window there?

858
00:54:27,412 --> 00:54:29,073
I was-

859
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:32,513
I was wondering, where is Tacoma?

860
00:54:45,162 --> 00:54:48,394
- Repulsive.
- Oh, boy.

861
00:54:49,567 --> 00:54:53,594
- all right. You can all go to lunch now.
- Ew!

862
00:54:53,704 --> 00:54:57,334
Are you-
Ramona, why are you wearing pajamas?

863
00:54:59,076 --> 00:55:03,376
'Cause firemen do it that way?

864
00:55:03,481 --> 00:55:04,948
I see.

865
00:55:05,049 --> 00:55:09,145
Well, pajamas under your clothes
and eggs in your hair.

866
00:55:09,253 --> 00:55:12,052
You and your father
are breaking new ground together.

867
00:55:13,858 --> 00:55:15,984
You get comfortable in there.

868
00:55:22,332 --> 00:55:24,266
Come on.

869
00:55:24,368 --> 00:55:26,393
- Oh!

870
00:55:26,503 --> 00:55:29,438
Come on!

871
00:55:29,539 --> 00:55:31,370
You're kidding me.

872
00:55:31,475 --> 00:55:35,309
Try this one.
Okay. No, no. That's no good.

873
00:55:35,411 --> 00:55:37,380
I think this one's gonna be good.

874
00:55:46,256 --> 00:55:48,223
How'd the interview go today, Daddy?

875
00:55:48,324 --> 00:55:51,920
Well, I had to cancel the interview
when the nurse called.

876
00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:55,730
But there's other jobs out there.

877
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:00,699
Hey, we're not gonna let
one bad day get us down.

878
00:56:02,772 --> 00:56:07,505
Let's do somethin'... really special.

879
00:56:07,610 --> 00:56:10,841
Just me and you.
What would you like to do? Think big.

880
00:56:13,015 --> 00:56:17,850
Well, you know that big bridge we took
when we went to Washington State?

881
00:56:17,953 --> 00:56:20,979
- Yeah.
- I've always wanted to stop in the middle...

882
00:56:21,089 --> 00:56:23,650
and have one foot in Oregon
and one in Washington.

883
00:56:23,759 --> 00:56:27,422
- Hmm?
- That way my Legs have dual citizenship.

884
00:56:27,530 --> 00:56:30,624
I like it.

885
00:56:30,732 --> 00:56:32,825
That's interesting. Interesting notion.

886
00:56:32,935 --> 00:56:35,494
Not practical because the car's kaput...

887
00:56:35,604 --> 00:56:37,504
but you're on the right track.

888
00:56:37,606 --> 00:56:40,234
I mean, it's bold, it's daring,
it's fairly inexpensive.

889
00:56:40,342 --> 00:56:42,334
Come on. Give me- What else?

890
00:56:44,813 --> 00:56:46,713
We could draw it.

891
00:56:48,417 --> 00:56:52,079
Oh! I've got an idea.

892
00:56:55,290 --> 00:56:59,784
Let's me and you draw
the longest picture in the world.

893
00:56:59,894 --> 00:57:02,727
What do you think?

894
00:57:12,073 --> 00:57:14,040
Okay.

895
00:57:14,141 --> 00:57:18,043
I'm gonna draw our house,
and then I'm gonna draw Howie's house...

896
00:57:18,145 --> 00:57:21,342
and school and Mount Hood...

897
00:57:21,449 --> 00:57:24,906
and everything else as far as I can see.

898
00:57:30,424 --> 00:57:32,324
- Daddy?
- Hmm?

899
00:57:34,161 --> 00:57:37,153
I think you draw better
than anybody in the whole world.

900
00:57:38,199 --> 00:57:41,998
Oh. Well, thank you, Pickle.

901
00:57:42,103 --> 00:57:44,832
You know, I studied art
back in the day, as they say.

902
00:57:44,938 --> 00:57:46,838
What happened?

903
00:57:47,875 --> 00:57:49,775
Did you get a bad report card?

904
00:57:49,877 --> 00:57:52,471
No.

905
00:57:52,579 --> 00:57:55,070
Beezus came along.

906
00:57:55,182 --> 00:57:57,616
Then I took the best job I could,
and before you know it...

907
00:57:57,718 --> 00:57:59,618
I was a vice president.

908
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:02,917
- Then I came along?
- Yep. That's right.

909
00:58:03,023 --> 00:58:04,922
And then Roberta.

910
00:58:07,261 --> 00:58:10,628
But I wouldn't change a thing.
You girls make my life very colorful.

911
00:58:30,917 --> 00:58:32,851
- Hi. Hey, Beezus.
- Hey.

912
00:58:32,952 --> 00:58:35,887
- Wanna walk home?
- Sure.

913
00:58:35,988 --> 00:58:37,546
Cool.

914
00:58:38,591 --> 00:58:40,491
Oh, man.

915
00:58:40,593 --> 00:58:43,892
When we were kids, I thought your dad was,
like, the king of Klickitat Street.

916
00:58:43,996 --> 00:58:47,090
Do you remember that gorilla hunt
in my backyard...

917
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:50,600
when he made us set up the tents
and wait there all night...

918
00:58:50,703 --> 00:58:53,103
with bananas and butterfly nets?

919
00:58:53,206 --> 00:58:56,039
You ended up with mashed bananas
in your hair.

920
00:58:56,141 --> 00:58:58,474
I had poison ivy all over me.

921
00:58:58,578 --> 00:59:00,478
But it was also-

922
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:03,378
- The best time we had that whole summer.
- Hands down.

923
00:59:07,419 --> 00:59:10,116
Yeah, well, he's not as funny these days.

924
00:59:10,222 --> 00:59:12,747
Why? What's going on?

925
00:59:12,858 --> 00:59:16,124
He lost his job a few weeks ago...

926
00:59:16,228 --> 00:59:20,597
and he acts like he's not worried,
for our sake, but I can tell he is.

927
00:59:20,699 --> 00:59:22,724
And he should be.

928
00:59:22,835 --> 00:59:25,701
What if he doesn't get something
that he likes?

929
00:59:27,373 --> 00:59:29,840
What if he has to settle
for something that he hates...

930
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:32,569
because of... us?

931
00:59:33,979 --> 00:59:36,140
Beezus, that's a big deal.

932
00:59:36,248 --> 00:59:39,046
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I don't know.

933
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:47,387
I don't know. Sometimes...
things feel different between us.

934
00:59:47,492 --> 00:59:51,519
Like it's not as easy to talk to you
as it used to be, you know?

935
00:59:53,364 --> 00:59:56,299
Yeah. Yeah, I guess. A little.

936
00:59:56,401 --> 00:59:59,165
- It's not that I don't want to talk to you-
- No, no. I get you.

937
00:59:59,270 --> 01:00:01,568
- It's just very different.
- Different.

938
01:00:01,672 --> 01:00:03,572
Exactly.

939
01:00:05,743 --> 01:00:07,233
Oh, gosh.

940
01:00:07,345 --> 01:00:09,335
Um- Yeah.

941
01:00:09,446 --> 01:00:11,107
Thank you.

942
01:00:11,215 --> 01:00:14,013
- You should probably button that.
- Oh.

943
01:00:14,118 --> 01:00:18,214
Yeah. It's good to know
some things never change.

944
01:00:22,826 --> 01:00:26,125
- Since my last report had some holes in it-

945
01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:28,697
Mrs. Meacham gave me a do-over.

946
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:31,393
So, may I present to you...

947
01:00:31,502 --> 01:00:34,130
the longest picture in the world.

948
01:00:47,585 --> 01:00:50,178
- Wow.

949
01:00:53,256 --> 01:00:56,419
- Ooh.

950
01:00:56,526 --> 01:01:01,486
Excuse me, but what about the paintings
in those big churches in Europe?

951
01:01:01,598 --> 01:01:04,294
I mean, aren't they longer?

952
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,925
Yeah, but that's Europe.

953
01:01:07,036 --> 01:01:09,630
I mean, I'm talkin' about the whole world.

954
01:01:09,739 --> 01:01:12,867
Susan, you may save your comments for later.

955
01:01:12,976 --> 01:01:14,876
- Ramona, go ahead.

956
01:01:19,649 --> 01:01:21,674
My dad made this with me.

957
01:01:21,784 --> 01:01:24,752
He could have been an artist
when he was younger...

958
01:01:24,854 --> 01:01:26,822
but he decided to be my dad.

959
01:01:26,922 --> 01:01:31,155
And he's teaching me how to draw, too,
which means he's patient.

960
01:01:32,862 --> 01:01:35,456
- P-A-T-I-E-N-T?
- Mm-hmm.

961
01:01:35,564 --> 01:01:38,931
But you really need to see it close up,
so come and enjoy the view.

962
01:01:39,034 --> 01:01:43,631
# Dream a little dream with me
Singin' la-la-la, la-la-la #

963
01:01:43,739 --> 01:01:47,106
Who can see themselves in here?

964
01:01:47,209 --> 01:01:51,236
# Maybe we can find
the edge of the world#

965
01:01:51,347 --> 01:01:55,442
# Oh, maybe we can find
the edge of the world ##

966
01:01:56,551 --> 01:02:00,181
Uh, "Looking for a princess in Portland"?

967
01:02:01,623 --> 01:02:03,853
Branding. They'll eat it up.

968
01:02:03,959 --> 01:02:05,859
Yeah?

969
01:02:05,961 --> 01:02:08,429
Well, wait till they see this.

970
01:02:11,033 --> 01:02:14,263
Every princess needs a little sparkle.

971
01:02:14,369 --> 01:02:16,336
Just mix this up.

972
01:02:17,939 --> 01:02:20,805
We have three little girls.
We have to be realistic.

973
01:02:20,909 --> 01:02:25,243
- I can't wait another 10 years of my life.
- It's not settling!

974
01:02:27,115 --> 01:02:29,606
But what about the kids?
They've got school, we got the mortgage.

975
01:02:29,717 --> 01:02:32,778
- Unbelievable.

976
01:02:32,887 --> 01:02:35,049
- Wait!

977
01:02:35,156 --> 01:02:38,320
- Oh!

978
01:02:38,426 --> 01:02:40,724
Okay there, Sticky Picky.

979
01:02:40,828 --> 01:02:44,161
I know you're old and creaky, too,
but this is my bed tonight. Come on.

980
01:02:44,265 --> 01:02:46,563
- Okay? Come on. Come on.

981
01:02:46,668 --> 01:02:48,362
Good man.

982
01:02:48,469 --> 01:02:50,938
- Dad, it's Picky Picky.
- Hey.

983
01:02:54,175 --> 01:02:58,305
Dad, are you and Mom getting a divorce?

984
01:02:58,412 --> 01:03:00,312
No.

985
01:03:00,414 --> 01:03:03,406
This is like a time-out for the night.

986
01:03:03,517 --> 01:03:06,645
Come on.
We'll both be happily married in the morning.

987
01:03:06,753 --> 01:03:08,722
- Mwah! Go to bed.
- Okay.

988
01:03:12,359 --> 01:03:14,259
Dad, don't worry.

989
01:03:14,361 --> 01:03:16,386
Things are gonna change for us.

990
01:03:16,496 --> 01:03:18,396
I have a plan.

991
01:03:18,498 --> 01:03:20,159
Now I am worried.

992
01:03:20,267 --> 01:03:23,293
- Look, Mom! It's the ice cream man!

993
01:03:35,281 --> 01:03:39,445
- Hey. You sure this is what you want?
- Mm-hmm.

994
01:03:40,687 --> 01:03:43,282
- Thanks for the ride, Mr. Kemp.
- No problem.

995
01:03:43,389 --> 01:03:46,358
You know, you are allowed
to call me Hobart if you want.

996
01:03:46,459 --> 01:03:49,723
No, thank you, Mr. Kemp.
This is strictly a business relationship.

997
01:03:49,829 --> 01:03:52,593
- Okay.
- Wow! Good for you.

998
01:03:52,699 --> 01:03:55,395
- all right.
- At least one of us is showing a little restraint.

999
01:03:55,502 --> 01:03:57,629
- Ha-ha.

1000
01:03:57,737 --> 01:03:59,932
- Break a leg, superstar.
- Okay.

1001
01:04:01,508 --> 01:04:03,408
Next is Ruby Hirsch.

1002
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:05,568
Hey, Susan.

1003
01:04:05,678 --> 01:04:08,373
Wow. You look great.

1004
01:04:08,481 --> 01:04:10,381
Hello, Ramona.

1005
01:04:10,483 --> 01:04:14,852
Susan! How could you be a princess
without your tiara?

1006
01:04:14,954 --> 01:04:17,684
- Hi, Mrs. Kushner.
- Hello, Ramona.

1007
01:04:17,790 --> 01:04:20,156
Okay. Let's go. That looks beautiful.

1008
01:04:25,330 --> 01:04:28,094
Excuse me! Aunt Bea, I need a tiara!

1009
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:31,567
- It takes a real man to be able
to drive around in this.

1010
01:04:31,671 --> 01:04:33,399
Oh, by the way, I talked to my publisher.

1011
01:04:33,572 --> 01:04:35,403
He found me an apartment in Anchorage.

1012
01:04:35,507 --> 01:04:37,771
Very spacious. Got great views.

1013
01:04:38,811 --> 01:04:40,301
Room for two.

1014
01:04:45,884 --> 01:04:47,510
Well.

1015
01:04:49,087 --> 01:04:52,750
Maybe you can find
a nice polar bear to cuddle up with.

1016
01:04:52,857 --> 01:04:54,757
Eh, Alaska could be fun, Bea.

1017
01:04:54,859 --> 01:04:57,556
I mean, it is still the last great frontier.
You know that, right?

1018
01:04:57,662 --> 01:04:59,096
Mm-hmm.

1019
01:04:59,197 --> 01:05:01,131
Plus, it's only a two-year commitment.

1020
01:05:01,232 --> 01:05:04,293
Commitment was never your thing.

1021
01:05:04,402 --> 01:05:07,030
Okay. Now, that's just not fair.

1022
01:05:07,138 --> 01:05:09,664
Bea, you've gotta give me a chance here.
Come on.

1023
01:05:09,774 --> 01:05:12,868
I've been traveling the world for over 10
years trying to get you out of my head.

1024
01:05:12,978 --> 01:05:15,343
- And you know what?
- What?

1025
01:05:15,447 --> 01:05:17,346
It ain't workin'.

1026
01:05:18,817 --> 01:05:21,785
I didn't come here for this stupid Jeep.
I came here for you.

1027
01:05:25,323 --> 01:05:27,223
Come with me.

1028
01:05:50,314 --> 01:05:53,282
Next is- whoa-

1029
01:05:53,384 --> 01:05:55,112
Ramona Quimby.

1030
01:06:01,191 --> 01:06:04,752
My goodness.
That's quite the tiara you have there.

1031
01:06:05,863 --> 01:06:08,160
I designed it in the parking lot.

1032
01:06:11,368 --> 01:06:14,269
- So tell me, why are you here today?

1033
01:06:14,371 --> 01:06:18,364
'Cause my dad says that commercials
are the racket to be in.

1034
01:06:18,475 --> 01:06:20,705
Hmm. Twirl.

1035
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:22,778
Twirl.

1036
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:38,225
Okay. Thank you, Ramona.

1037
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:42,422
- Don't move.

1038
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:45,468
A tiara made of burrs?

1039
01:06:45,567 --> 01:06:49,129
It would have worked, Dad,
until I fell into their stupid sandwich.

1040
01:06:50,807 --> 01:06:52,433
- Sandwich?
- Ow!

1041
01:06:52,542 --> 01:06:56,807
- I won't even ask.
- Ow! You're doing it too fast!

1042
01:06:56,913 --> 01:06:59,574
'Cause I'm late, Ramona. Very late.

1043
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:01,149
Sorry.

1044
01:07:04,053 --> 01:07:07,045
How's it look? Kinda trendy?

1045
01:07:09,391 --> 01:07:12,656
Oh. Yes, well, that's one way of putting it.

1046
01:07:12,761 --> 01:07:14,922
- Listen up, ladies.

1047
01:07:15,030 --> 01:07:17,555
I got a two-hour drive
to get to this interview...

1048
01:07:17,666 --> 01:07:21,534
so I need you to be responsible
till your mom gets home.

1049
01:07:21,636 --> 01:07:23,935
You have her number at the office
if there's a problem...

1050
01:07:24,039 --> 01:07:27,338
but remember, she's under a lot of stress,
so no fighting, okay?

1051
01:07:27,442 --> 01:07:29,968
Beezus, you're in charge. Baby monitor.

1052
01:07:30,078 --> 01:07:32,309
How come she's always in charge?

1053
01:07:32,414 --> 01:07:34,381
Um, have you seen your hair lately?

1054
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:36,473
- Imagine what you'd do to our house.
- Hey!

1055
01:07:36,585 --> 01:07:39,145
Just try to be good- especially you.

1056
01:07:39,253 --> 01:07:40,481
- Bye!

1057
01:07:42,623 --> 01:07:45,889
"Especially you. "

1058
01:07:57,839 --> 01:08:02,276
Ramona, I don't think making dinner
is gonna distract Mom from your hair.

1059
01:08:03,478 --> 01:08:06,675
- It's worth a shot.

1060
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:10,581
Quimby residence. Oh, hi, Henry.

1061
01:08:10,684 --> 01:08:13,346
I'm not sure if Beezus is available.

1062
01:08:13,454 --> 01:08:16,445
- Give it to me! Stop! Give it to me!
- She could be in the bathroom.

1063
01:08:16,557 --> 01:08:18,855
- Go away, you jerk!
- Wait. What did you say?

1064
01:08:18,959 --> 01:08:20,859
- No, not you, Henry!
- Ow!

1065
01:08:20,961 --> 01:08:22,326
You put him on speaker, doofus!

1066
01:08:22,429 --> 01:08:26,025
- I'm Beezus! I love Henry!
- Shut up!

1067
01:08:28,169 --> 01:08:30,033
Should I call back later?

1068
01:08:30,137 --> 01:08:31,765
- No! I want you!
- Huh?

1069
01:08:31,872 --> 01:08:34,841
I mean, I wanna talk to you right now,
so now is a good time!

1070
01:08:34,941 --> 01:08:37,206
- Okay.
- Get off!

1071
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:42,147
My hot dog souffle!

1072
01:08:46,686 --> 01:08:48,586
Stop!

1073
01:08:50,690 --> 01:08:52,783
- Ramona!

1074
01:08:54,528 --> 01:08:56,587
- Ramona, move!

1075
01:08:56,696 --> 01:08:59,324
Stop! Stop that! Drop it!

1076
01:08:59,433 --> 01:09:01,901
- No!
- I said, drop it!

1077
01:09:11,878 --> 01:09:14,471
You will never change, will you?

1078
01:09:14,581 --> 01:09:17,276
For a moment there,
I actually thought that you were maturing...

1079
01:09:17,383 --> 01:09:19,374
but you will always be a little pest!

1080
01:09:22,721 --> 01:09:25,121
- I'll go get her.
- No! Just stop!

1081
01:09:25,225 --> 01:09:27,124
Stop touching everything!

1082
01:09:27,227 --> 01:09:29,285
Everything that you touch you mess up...

1083
01:09:29,395 --> 01:09:31,295
including my love life.

1084
01:09:31,397 --> 01:09:33,627
You have a love life?

1085
01:09:34,868 --> 01:09:37,233
Just feed the cat and leave me alone!

1086
01:09:47,246 --> 01:09:49,237
Uh, hello?

1087
01:09:49,348 --> 01:09:52,715
Okay. I'm gonna hang up now.

1088
01:09:55,254 --> 01:09:57,552
Picky Picky?

1089
01:09:57,656 --> 01:10:00,055
It's dinnertime.

1090
01:10:00,158 --> 01:10:02,457
- Come on.

1091
01:10:02,561 --> 01:10:04,892
Let's talk.

1092
01:10:04,997 --> 01:10:07,295
Wake up.

1093
01:10:07,398 --> 01:10:09,959
Wake up, lazy bum.

1094
01:10:17,643 --> 01:10:19,906
- Beezus!

1095
01:10:25,366 --> 01:10:27,266
- Beezus?

1096
01:10:27,368 --> 01:10:29,598
I thought he was asleep, but he's not.

1097
01:10:33,374 --> 01:10:35,274
What now?

1098
01:10:35,376 --> 01:10:37,742
He's dead.

1099
01:10:37,845 --> 01:10:41,576
Picky Picky's dead.

1100
01:10:43,017 --> 01:10:46,851
Don't worry. Mom will be home soon.
She'll know what to do.

1101
01:10:46,954 --> 01:10:49,444
No. Remember what Dad said?

1102
01:10:51,392 --> 01:10:54,087
We can't make any trouble for Mom now.

1103
01:10:56,262 --> 01:10:58,162
Okay.

1104
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,366
He was a Quimby before we were, Beezus.

1105
01:11:06,806 --> 01:11:08,933
Picky Picky...

1106
01:11:10,143 --> 01:11:12,611
I hope you have nine lives.

1107
01:11:13,780 --> 01:11:16,248
And maybe tomorrow...

1108
01:11:16,349 --> 01:11:19,341
you can wake up as somebody else's cat...

1109
01:11:19,452 --> 01:11:20,919
start a new life.

1110
01:11:23,189 --> 01:11:26,487
I really hope
they feed you melon rind sometimes.

1111
01:11:29,128 --> 01:11:31,096
I know you like that.

1112
01:11:36,903 --> 01:11:39,132
I think it's important...

1113
01:11:39,238 --> 01:11:41,138
that you know...

1114
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:44,641
Dad was just pretending to forget your name.

1115
01:11:47,813 --> 01:11:49,337
He always knew it.

1116
01:11:50,916 --> 01:11:52,885
He really did love you.

1117
01:12:00,826 --> 01:12:03,056
We'll miss you, Picky Picky.

1118
01:12:15,207 --> 01:12:17,835
It's okay.

1119
01:12:26,918 --> 01:12:29,751
You girls had to handle
all this tonight by yourselves?

1120
01:12:30,856 --> 01:12:32,323
I'm sorry.

1121
01:12:33,492 --> 01:12:36,393
We're okay, Mom.

1122
01:12:36,495 --> 01:12:40,397
How did I get so lucky
to have two brave girls like you?

1123
01:12:40,498 --> 01:12:42,467
Hmm?

1124
01:12:45,236 --> 01:12:47,295
I'm home!

1125
01:12:47,404 --> 01:12:50,032
We have some news.

1126
01:12:50,141 --> 01:12:52,803
So do l. I got the job.

1127
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:54,775
What?

1128
01:12:54,879 --> 01:12:57,439
Great position.

1129
01:12:57,548 --> 01:12:59,516
Start-up in eastern Oregon.

1130
01:13:00,784 --> 01:13:02,911
How do you girls feel about that?

1131
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:05,545
Wait. To live there?

1132
01:13:05,656 --> 01:13:07,122
Mm-hmm.

1133
01:13:07,224 --> 01:13:09,283
But what about the house?

1134
01:13:10,660 --> 01:13:12,855
We'll get a new one there.

1135
01:13:13,898 --> 01:13:15,798
What's your news?

1136
01:13:19,436 --> 01:13:21,336
Nothing.

1137
01:13:27,210 --> 01:13:29,678
Ramona?

1138
01:13:30,781 --> 01:13:33,079
Will you sleep in here with me tonight?

1139
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:46,259
I'm not ready for a new school...

1140
01:13:47,363 --> 01:13:49,093
with all new kids.

1141
01:13:50,167 --> 01:13:51,963
Me neither.

1142
01:13:52,068 --> 01:13:54,036
But you'll do fine.

1143
01:13:55,471 --> 01:13:58,928
You don't always embarrass yourself like I do.

1144
01:13:59,042 --> 01:14:02,136
You're the most prettiest,
perfect girl in high school...

1145
01:14:02,245 --> 01:14:04,941
and everybody loves you.

1146
01:14:05,048 --> 01:14:08,779
Ramona,
those people don't know who I am, really.

1147
01:14:10,986 --> 01:14:14,514
There's only one person
in that whole school who really knows me.

1148
01:14:14,623 --> 01:14:17,183
- Henry?
- Yeah.

1149
01:14:19,328 --> 01:14:21,455
And that took 15 years.

1150
01:14:23,499 --> 01:14:27,366
Who else is gonna wanna waste 15 years
getting to know me?

1151
01:14:30,772 --> 01:14:32,831
I would.

1152
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:39,607
Ramona...

1153
01:14:39,715 --> 01:14:42,183
I know that you think
being different is bad...

1154
01:14:44,853 --> 01:14:46,821
but it's not.

1155
01:14:49,123 --> 01:14:52,685
You don't worry about coloring
inside the lines, you know?

1156
01:14:52,794 --> 01:14:54,352
Huh?

1157
01:14:54,463 --> 01:14:57,796
You're your own person.

1158
01:14:57,899 --> 01:15:00,059
You don't care what other people think.

1159
01:15:00,168 --> 01:15:02,432
It's brave being how you are.

1160
01:15:04,839 --> 01:15:06,740
Oh.

1161
01:15:06,841 --> 01:15:08,672
Well...

1162
01:15:08,776 --> 01:15:12,268
sometimes I color inside the lines.

1163
01:15:12,380 --> 01:15:14,349
It really depends on the picture.

1164
01:15:14,449 --> 01:15:16,416
Yeah.

1165
01:15:17,685 --> 01:15:20,347
All right.
So, how does this look?

1166
01:15:20,455 --> 01:15:23,116
It's perfect. Yeah, it's great.

1167
01:15:24,859 --> 01:15:27,987
Why does it have to be Susan's mom?

1168
01:15:28,095 --> 01:15:30,689
She's supposed to be a very good agent,
sweetheart.

1169
01:15:34,368 --> 01:15:37,428
- That's great. Ta-da!

1170
01:15:40,574 --> 01:15:44,135
Aren't you gonna help us, Ramona?
We only have a few hours to do this.

1171
01:15:44,245 --> 01:15:46,475
I don't wanna help sell the house.

1172
01:15:46,580 --> 01:15:48,480
I wanted to save it.

1173
01:15:48,582 --> 01:15:50,742
Are you gonna fill these holes before you go?

1174
01:15:50,851 --> 01:15:52,409
Howie wants to do it.

1175
01:15:52,519 --> 01:15:54,987
Why don't you get
your boyfrlend Hobart to help?

1176
01:15:55,088 --> 01:15:58,217
- He likes to dig.
- Isn't that the truth?

1177
01:15:58,326 --> 01:16:00,793
Now he wants me to go with him to Alaska.

1178
01:16:00,894 --> 01:16:03,989
Last night, he sent roses.

1179
01:16:04,097 --> 01:16:06,122
Alaska? Did you say yes?

1180
01:16:08,201 --> 01:16:10,329
I mean, I was tempted...

1181
01:16:10,437 --> 01:16:12,905
but if I'm gonna uproot my entire life...

1182
01:16:13,006 --> 01:16:15,566
I need some real sign of commitment.

1183
01:16:15,676 --> 01:16:18,143
- I'm sorry, Bea.
- Oh, no. Don't be.

1184
01:16:18,244 --> 01:16:21,907
We had our fight,
and now he's running away again.

1185
01:16:22,015 --> 01:16:26,475
In the long run,
I saved myself a massive heartache...

1186
01:16:26,586 --> 01:16:29,714
and just replaced it with a... small one.

1187
01:16:34,860 --> 01:16:38,092
Ramona, grab a hose and help out, okay?

1188
01:16:38,198 --> 01:16:42,362
I know life stinks,
but we still have to make the yard look good.

1189
01:16:42,469 --> 01:16:45,267
Everything will be okay, babe.
Onwards and upwards.

1190
01:16:48,975 --> 01:16:50,670
- Oh!

1191
01:16:50,776 --> 01:16:52,971
Oh, I see! Very funny.

1192
01:16:53,079 --> 01:16:56,844
Who did that? Bea? That's just adorable.

1193
01:16:56,949 --> 01:16:59,679
Classy, Bea. Very classy.

1194
01:16:59,785 --> 01:17:03,516
Now I gotta go inside
and change all my clothes.

1195
01:17:03,623 --> 01:17:05,750
Real nice.

1196
01:17:07,393 --> 01:17:09,191
- Bea.

1197
01:17:09,294 --> 01:17:11,159
Ah!

1198
01:17:11,264 --> 01:17:13,629
That's for the roses, sweetheart.
They need water.

1199
01:17:13,732 --> 01:17:17,828
Oh! There it is! Exhibit "A"!

1200
01:17:17,936 --> 01:17:20,063
The class clown hasn't changed at all!

1201
01:17:20,172 --> 01:17:21,571
Oh, really?

1202
01:17:26,678 --> 01:17:29,044
Okay. That's how it is, huh?

1203
01:17:31,150 --> 01:17:33,175
Howie! Willa Jean!

1204
01:17:33,284 --> 01:17:35,219
Mom!

1205
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:37,184
- Ladies, I need backup!

1206
01:17:39,324 --> 01:17:41,723
- Find a garden hose!
- Okay. Come on.

1207
01:17:47,198 --> 01:17:49,996
I hope you get frostbite in Alaska!

1208
01:17:52,603 --> 01:17:54,901
Be strong. Be strong, Willa Jean.

1209
01:17:55,973 --> 01:17:57,874
Be strong!

1210
01:18:00,344 --> 01:18:02,779
Get' em!

1211
01:18:04,515 --> 01:18:07,916
- Oh!
- Yeah! Now what? Now what?

1212
01:18:09,220 --> 01:18:11,245
Aunt Bea!

1213
01:18:13,558 --> 01:18:15,287
- Go, go, go!
- Hey, wait, wait, wait.

1214
01:18:15,393 --> 01:18:17,793
- Whoo!

1215
01:18:17,895 --> 01:18:20,557
I think we won. I think we won!

1216
01:18:20,665 --> 01:18:23,190
- Give me some! Whoo-hoo!

1217
01:18:23,301 --> 01:18:26,566
Nice job, you guys. You were animals!

1218
01:18:29,073 --> 01:18:30,630
Whoo-hoo!

1219
01:18:30,741 --> 01:18:33,301
Look who's crying now!

1220
01:18:37,348 --> 01:18:41,750
My pipes! I told you, my pipes!

1221
01:18:48,859 --> 01:18:51,828
- What's all the shouting about?
- Landscaping.

1222
01:18:55,198 --> 01:18:57,099
Oh!

1223
01:18:58,367 --> 01:19:00,962
What? Uh-

1224
01:19:01,071 --> 01:19:03,834
Hobart was right!
It's an ancient curse!

1225
01:19:08,612 --> 01:19:10,443
Oh!

1226
01:19:11,547 --> 01:19:13,516
What?

1227
01:19:16,352 --> 01:19:18,617
I knew it was around here somewhere!

1228
01:19:18,721 --> 01:19:20,781
Bea! Bea, come here. Come here.

1229
01:19:20,890 --> 01:19:23,257
Come here, come here, come here, come here.

1230
01:19:25,261 --> 01:19:29,197
Oh, Beatrice,
I buried this baby a long time ago...

1231
01:19:29,298 --> 01:19:32,267
and I figured I'd find it again someday
when I was ready.

1232
01:19:32,368 --> 01:19:34,563
I still wish that I could go back and fix...

1233
01:19:34,670 --> 01:19:37,662
all the stupid things I did
when we were younger.

1234
01:19:39,776 --> 01:19:42,335
I guess this is as close as I can get.

1235
01:19:54,857 --> 01:19:56,825
You kept all this stuff?

1236
01:19:56,926 --> 01:19:58,449
Yeah.

1237
01:20:02,164 --> 01:20:04,131
That's my gum ball ring.

1238
01:20:15,710 --> 01:20:19,077
Bea, I don't want to go anyplace else
without you.

1239
01:20:20,182 --> 01:20:22,149
I love you.

1240
01:20:23,418 --> 01:20:25,318
Will you marry me?

1241
01:20:31,025 --> 01:20:32,993
You will?

1242
01:20:48,042 --> 01:20:50,636
- Whoo!

1243
01:20:52,814 --> 01:20:56,272
- Guts!

1244
01:20:56,383 --> 01:20:58,443
My head is spinning!

1245
01:20:58,552 --> 01:21:01,282
We must be crazy! We'll have to go
to the courthouse and make it official.

1246
01:21:01,388 --> 01:21:03,380
No, we ain't goin' to no stinking courthouse.

1247
01:21:03,491 --> 01:21:05,651
If we're gonna do something crazy,
we're gonna do it with style.

1248
01:21:05,759 --> 01:21:07,284
We're gonna throw a real wedding.

1249
01:21:07,394 --> 01:21:09,760
- Honey, they want you in Alaska in three days.
- That's plenty of time.

1250
01:21:09,864 --> 01:21:12,628
Sure. But what about a church or food...

1251
01:21:12,733 --> 01:21:14,702
or, say, a wedding dress?

1252
01:21:14,801 --> 01:21:17,066
You can use mine.
You always said you liked it.

1253
01:21:17,170 --> 01:21:19,297
- We can just alter it.
- Yeah! See? I like that idea.

1254
01:21:19,406 --> 01:21:21,875
- There you go!
- Hand-me-downs. It never ends, Ramona.

1255
01:21:21,975 --> 01:21:24,603
Yeah. We get the word out, we book a band...

1256
01:21:24,711 --> 01:21:26,201
boom- we got a wedding!

1257
01:21:26,313 --> 01:21:28,474
People can bring their own food,
their own chairs.

1258
01:21:28,582 --> 01:21:33,212
All we need is a little love
and a few bridesmaids.

1259
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:35,550
Oh! I've always wanted to be a bridesmaid.

1260
01:21:35,656 --> 01:21:38,124
Ah! Well, that was easy. Anybody else?

1261
01:21:38,225 --> 01:21:41,558
- Ramona? Ramona?
- What do you say? Will you do us the honor?

1262
01:21:43,830 --> 01:21:46,094
Ramona?

1263
01:21:46,199 --> 01:21:47,791
Sea bass!

1264
01:21:49,202 --> 01:21:52,399
- See what?
- Oh, it's an inside joke. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1265
01:21:52,505 --> 01:21:54,303
You said you wouldn't get reeled in.

1266
01:21:54,407 --> 01:21:56,432
You said I would always have you around!

1267
01:21:56,543 --> 01:21:58,533
Hey, Ramona? Get back here and apologize.

1268
01:21:58,645 --> 01:22:01,204
- Honey, please come talk to me.

1269
01:22:10,023 --> 01:22:12,855
You have room for a piano.

1270
01:22:12,958 --> 01:22:15,017
Also, look at this built-in desk.
It's fabulous.

1271
01:22:37,049 --> 01:22:38,641
Here.

1272
01:22:42,921 --> 01:22:45,015
- Ramona?
- Stuff that's to go around here, right?

1273
01:22:45,123 --> 01:22:46,989
Ramona!

1274
01:22:53,799 --> 01:22:55,925
Help, anybody!

1275
01:22:57,569 --> 01:23:00,129
- Oh, Ramona!
- Whoa, whoa!

1276
01:23:00,239 --> 01:23:02,672
- Got you! I got you! Come on, honey.
- Okay. Hold on.

1277
01:23:02,774 --> 01:23:05,004
- We got you!

1278
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:07,670
We saw your underpants.

1279
01:23:07,779 --> 01:23:09,905
- Hey, enough.

1280
01:23:10,014 --> 01:23:13,040
Hey, enough.
Stop the teasing. Go outside.

1281
01:23:13,151 --> 01:23:15,346
Happens all the time. Thank you.

1282
01:23:15,453 --> 01:23:17,819
Okay, Ramona, that's it.

1283
01:23:17,922 --> 01:23:20,516
These antics of yours gotta stop right now.

1284
01:23:20,625 --> 01:23:22,990
You're making our lives really difficult.

1285
01:23:24,095 --> 01:23:26,325
I thought I made it colorful, Dad.

1286
01:23:26,430 --> 01:23:29,729
- Not in the middle
of our open house. Come on!

1287
01:23:29,834 --> 01:23:33,234
You said you were gonna be more responsible.
It's time to grow up.

1288
01:23:33,337 --> 01:23:36,067
Dad, can't you see I'm trying?

1289
01:23:36,173 --> 01:23:39,074
- Well, you gotta try harder.
- Dad?

1290
01:23:39,176 --> 01:23:43,409
- Mrs. Meacham's on the phone.
She needs to talk to you.
- Oh, great. What now?

1291
01:23:43,514 --> 01:23:45,448
Sweetie.

1292
01:23:53,190 --> 01:23:55,954
- Ramona, your father was just-
- Mom!

1293
01:23:56,059 --> 01:23:59,586
I'm nine years old.
I think I can tell when I'm not wanted.

1294
01:23:59,696 --> 01:24:01,994
- I just have to run away.

1295
01:24:02,099 --> 01:24:05,796
- Ramona, don't be silly.
You're not gonna run away.
- No, I mean it.

1296
01:24:07,104 --> 01:24:09,095
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

1297
01:24:11,542 --> 01:24:13,442
How long will you be gone?

1298
01:24:15,512 --> 01:24:18,447
I mean, just in case people start asking.

1299
01:24:19,649 --> 01:24:21,116
Forever.

1300
01:24:22,919 --> 01:24:26,913
Well, in that case,
I think you're gonna need a bigger suitcase.

1301
01:24:33,095 --> 01:24:35,393
Okay. Now, I've added your dad's old sweater.

1302
01:24:35,498 --> 01:24:37,466
I don't want you to get cold at night.

1303
01:24:37,567 --> 01:24:42,231
It's a little big on you now,
but you'll eventually grow into it.

1304
01:24:42,339 --> 01:24:44,898
Oh, and do you plan on brushing your teeth?

1305
01:24:45,942 --> 01:24:47,967
That's my girl.

1306
01:24:48,077 --> 01:24:50,875
I packed your toothbrush and your toothpaste.

1307
01:24:52,114 --> 01:24:53,513
Okay?

1308
01:24:53,615 --> 01:24:56,141
Just promise me that
you'll brush your teeth every single night.

1309
01:24:59,388 --> 01:25:01,253
There you go.

1310
01:25:04,426 --> 01:25:06,622
all righty.

1311
01:25:14,236 --> 01:25:16,137
Don't forget to write.

1312
01:26:21,468 --> 01:26:26,235
- Huh?

1313
01:26:39,053 --> 01:26:41,851
- Hmm?

1314
01:27:11,417 --> 01:27:14,545
- Daddy.

1315
01:27:25,098 --> 01:27:26,395
Gettin' on or not?

1316
01:27:28,067 --> 01:27:29,591
Ramona?

1317
01:27:29,702 --> 01:27:32,135
Sweetie? Ramona?

1318
01:27:40,146 --> 01:27:42,045
M-Mom?

1319
01:27:42,148 --> 01:27:43,479
- Ramona?
- Mom!

1320
01:27:44,817 --> 01:27:47,251
Yes. Where are you?

1321
01:27:47,353 --> 01:27:50,810
- Can you hear me? Mom?
- Ramona, sweetie?

1322
01:28:11,843 --> 01:28:14,334
You made my bag heavy on purpose.

1323
01:28:16,381 --> 01:28:18,906
Well, what else was I supposed to do, huh?

1324
01:28:19,017 --> 01:28:21,450
I'd be just lost without my Ramona.

1325
01:28:21,553 --> 01:28:24,282
I'm sorry.

1326
01:28:24,389 --> 01:28:26,949
I just thought you all
would be better off without me.

1327
01:28:27,059 --> 01:28:30,859
You don't think we'd let you get away that
easy, do you? You're a Quimby for life.

1328
01:28:33,231 --> 01:28:35,597
- Ah!

1329
01:28:37,402 --> 01:28:39,870
I hope nobody I know sees us out here.
We're so weird.

1330
01:29:27,851 --> 01:29:29,752
In sickness and in health.

1331
01:29:29,853 --> 01:29:32,686
- For richer or for poorer.
- For richer or for poorer.

1332
01:29:32,789 --> 01:29:34,757
And I promise my love to you.

1333
01:29:34,858 --> 01:29:37,349
And I promise my love to you.

1334
01:29:37,461 --> 01:29:39,621
And I promise my love to you.

1335
01:29:42,565 --> 01:29:44,965
May I have the rings, please?

1336
01:29:49,372 --> 01:29:51,704
- Pull it off.

1337
01:29:56,079 --> 01:29:58,138
- Well-

1338
01:29:58,248 --> 01:30:01,115
Don't panic, folks. It's only plastic.

1339
01:30:13,496 --> 01:30:14,895
Ramo-

1340
01:30:17,366 --> 01:30:19,232
Oh. Babe?

1341
01:30:24,507 --> 01:30:26,565
Ah. Look at you.

1342
01:30:26,676 --> 01:30:28,974
- Nice work, Ramona.

1343
01:30:43,091 --> 01:30:45,958
Hobart, that's- That's n-

1344
01:30:46,061 --> 01:30:48,825
That's- That's real.

1345
01:30:48,931 --> 01:30:52,833
Yeah, and I still owe you that quarter.

1346
01:30:52,935 --> 01:30:55,927
And I'm gonna spend the rest of my life
trying to pay it back.

1347
01:31:01,210 --> 01:31:02,837
Thank you.

1348
01:31:07,048 --> 01:31:09,812
Hobart, you may kiss the bride.

1349
01:31:22,464 --> 01:31:24,363
All right, Beatrice.

1350
01:31:24,466 --> 01:31:27,866
This song is dedicated to you from Hobart.
Hey, buddy.

1351
01:31:27,969 --> 01:31:29,459
Okay.

1352
01:31:29,570 --> 01:31:32,095
One, two. There we go. That's good.

1353
01:31:48,455 --> 01:31:51,391
- Hey, Beezus, I've been looking for you.
- Oh, hi.

1354
01:31:51,492 --> 01:31:53,391
- Nice wedding, huh?
- Yeah.

1355
01:31:53,494 --> 01:31:55,393
Um-

1356
01:31:57,431 --> 01:31:59,762
Okay, listen. Um, Beezus.

1357
01:31:59,867 --> 01:32:03,530
I know that you're moving, and that's bad.

1358
01:32:03,637 --> 01:32:05,662
But in a way it's also good, because...

1359
01:32:05,773 --> 01:32:09,003
I would never have the guts
to say this if you weren't.

1360
01:32:09,109 --> 01:32:10,736
So...

1361
01:32:12,312 --> 01:32:14,280
I don't think of you as a frlend.

1362
01:32:14,381 --> 01:32:17,111
No, I mean- No. That came out wrong.

1363
01:32:17,217 --> 01:32:19,913
- I mean, I think about you,
like, a lot, all the time.

1364
01:32:20,020 --> 01:32:22,386
It's just- Oh, no. You're laughing.

1365
01:32:24,624 --> 01:32:26,524
Why are you laughing?

1366
01:32:26,626 --> 01:32:29,959
Um- No, I'm sorry.
I'm listening. I am. It's just-

1367
01:32:34,501 --> 01:32:36,469
You've got something on your shirt.

1368
01:32:36,569 --> 01:32:38,968
Oh-

1369
01:32:45,611 --> 01:32:47,078
Gotcha.

1370
01:32:47,180 --> 01:32:49,944
Yeah.

1371
01:32:55,488 --> 01:32:58,650
Um, we should probably go dance
while we can...

1372
01:32:58,758 --> 01:33:00,588
'cause the band has a curfew, so-

1373
01:33:00,693 --> 01:33:03,059
- Oh.
- Yeah, let's dance. Okay.

1374
01:33:18,477 --> 01:33:21,412
- I think it's time for the father-daughter dance.

1375
01:33:24,783 --> 01:33:27,377
You did a wonderful job today, Pickle.

1376
01:33:27,486 --> 01:33:30,455
You were a perfect bridesmaid.

1377
01:33:30,555 --> 01:33:31,989
Thank you.

1378
01:33:35,494 --> 01:33:37,393
- Dad?
- Yeah?

1379
01:33:37,496 --> 01:33:40,123
What were you and Mrs. Meacham
just talking about?

1380
01:33:40,232 --> 01:33:44,327
'Cause whatever I did wrong,
I probably didn't mean it.

1381
01:33:44,436 --> 01:33:47,495
Well, believe it or not,
we weren't talking about you at all.

1382
01:33:47,606 --> 01:33:49,038
Really?

1383
01:33:49,141 --> 01:33:51,506
Yeah, she was talking about an opening...

1384
01:33:51,610 --> 01:33:54,874
for an art teacher at your school next term.

1385
01:33:54,980 --> 01:33:56,947
Remember when she called the house
the other day?

1386
01:33:57,048 --> 01:34:00,609
Well, she told me that she passed
that mural of ours on to the principal...

1387
01:34:00,718 --> 01:34:02,686
who mentioned it to the superintendent.

1388
01:34:02,788 --> 01:34:07,349
Long story short,
it's crummy pay, it's part-time.

1389
01:34:07,458 --> 01:34:10,825
I hear some of those kids
down at your school can be a real handful.

1390
01:34:10,928 --> 01:34:12,190
Oh!

1391
01:34:12,296 --> 01:34:15,629
But I'm thinking I'm gonna take it.

1392
01:34:16,801 --> 01:34:20,531
Oh, my gosh!
That's better than a fireman!

1393
01:34:20,638 --> 01:34:22,037
- I know.

1394
01:34:22,140 --> 01:34:24,005
Mm-hmm!

1395
01:34:24,108 --> 01:34:27,600
- I owe it all to you, Ramona.

1396
01:34:27,711 --> 01:34:29,680
You told me I could do anything.

1397
01:34:29,780 --> 01:34:31,874
It took me this long to believe it.

1398
01:34:33,316 --> 01:34:35,375
You really did save us, kiddo.

1399
01:34:38,823 --> 01:34:40,415
- Whoo!

1400
01:34:40,524 --> 01:34:43,392
- Whoo!

1401
01:34:43,493 --> 01:34:46,326
- Whew!

1402
01:34:56,973 --> 01:34:59,806
- Beezus! Beezus!

1403
01:34:59,910 --> 01:35:01,810
We don't have to move anymore!

1404
01:35:04,614 --> 01:35:06,774
- M mm. Mmm.

1405
01:35:06,883 --> 01:35:08,510
- Mrs. Meacham!
- Yes.

1406
01:35:08,618 --> 01:35:11,746
- I don't have to move anymore.
- I know.

1407
01:35:11,855 --> 01:35:14,380
We'll be together for the rest of the year.

1408
01:35:14,490 --> 01:35:16,618
I shall pace myself accordingly.

1409
01:35:18,261 --> 01:35:20,229
Thanks for helping my dad.

1410
01:35:21,397 --> 01:35:23,365
I just passed along the mural.

1411
01:35:23,466 --> 01:35:25,366
You're the one who inspired it.

1412
01:35:25,468 --> 01:35:30,235
I may not be an art critic, but I certainly
know something "terrifical" when I see it.

1413
01:35:33,243 --> 01:35:35,142
Oh!

1414
01:35:38,681 --> 01:35:40,616
Go on, now.

1415
01:35:40,716 --> 01:35:43,310
- Shake your booty.
- Okay.

1416
01:35:49,425 --> 01:35:54,192
- Oh! Bye!

1417
01:35:54,296 --> 01:35:56,821
- Oh, bye, Mom.

1418
01:35:56,932 --> 01:35:58,899
- I'll call you from Alaska.
- Okay.

1419
01:35:59,001 --> 01:36:00,468
Drive safely.

1420
01:36:03,272 --> 01:36:06,172
- Wait! Don't go yet!

1421
01:36:06,275 --> 01:36:08,174
- Don't go yet, Aunt Bea!

1422
01:36:12,347 --> 01:36:14,645
So you can always have me around.

1423
01:36:23,691 --> 01:36:27,321
Ramona, you're extraordinary.

1424
01:36:36,404 --> 01:36:38,338
- Bye!

1425
01:36:38,439 --> 01:36:41,431
- Bye!
- We love you!
