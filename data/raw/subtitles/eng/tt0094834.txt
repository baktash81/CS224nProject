No, we're not.
Look! Over there!

4
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,267
-Sam.
-Yeah?

5
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,067
I think we should head back.
We're getting' in too deep.

6
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,900
Aw, but...

7
00:02:15,967 --> 00:02:18,667
Wait a sec. What's that I hear?

8
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:22,067
It sounds like... women!

9
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,700
Laughing!

10
00:02:23,767 --> 00:02:25,633
-Let's get out of here.
-Aw, come on, man!

11
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,067
Don't be such a coward.
Let's check this out.

12
00:02:41,267 --> 00:02:42,333
Look at them!

13
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,300
They're beautiful!

14
00:02:45,367 --> 00:02:50,133
Aren't they the most lovely, sensuous,
inviting women you've ever seen?

15
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,133
-Let's get out of here.
-What, are you nuts?

16
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,267
Look at them!

17
00:02:54,433 --> 00:02:55,667
They're dangerous!

18
00:02:55,733 --> 00:02:57,633
They don't look dangerous.

19
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,367
They look lonely.

20
00:03:00,433 --> 00:03:01,900
Well, I'm getting out of here.

21
00:03:01,967 --> 00:03:04,133
Well, I'm going to go
introduce myself.

22
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,133

00:04:14,767 --> 00:04:16,733
Hello. Hi. Hi, girls.

25
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,767
Peace, peace?

26
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:22,800
Not peace, I mean, um, friends?

27
00:04:22,867 --> 00:04:25,067
Come on, guys.

28
00:04:25,067 --> 00:04:27,067
I just wanted an avocado.

29
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,133
WOMAN: Throughout history, the dominant
sex would subjugate the weaker.

30
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,633
Just as the Chinese bound the feet of young
girls to cripple them into helplessness,

31
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:44,467
so did the Amazon women break the
legs of boys to make them subservient.

32
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:48,533
Is it possible for men and
women to coexist as equals?

(BELL RINGS)

34
00:04:50,167 --> 00:04:51,733
That's the subject we'll
tackle in our next class.

35
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,300
Dr. Hunt, I really love your class.

36
00:05:02,367 --> 00:05:04,633
Well, thank you, Bunny.
You can call me Margo.

37
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,800
I like it so much, I've been thinking
about changing my major from home economics

38
00:05:07,867 --> 00:05:12,933
to feminist studies, but I wasn't sure if
you had any feminist cooking classes.

39
00:05:13,067 --> 00:05:16,633
I don't think we do, no.
Interesting thought, though.

40
00:05:21,433 --> 00:05:24,167
BUNNY: The idea of being socially
conditioned to be a sex object.

41
00:05:24,233 --> 00:05:26,367
Wait until I tell the girl
sat the sorority!

42
00:05:26,433 --> 00:05:28,733
Bunny, I think you should
take a few more classes

43
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,133
in women's studies before you
decide to switch majors.

44
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,067
But, Dr. Hunt, I know I want to be a
liberated girl. I can just feel it in my toes!

45
00:05:35,133 --> 00:05:37,067
It could be those pointy boots.

46
00:05:37,067 --> 00:05:39,233
-Margo!
-Dean Stockwell.

47
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,933
Dr. Hunt, these gentlemen from the United
States government would like to talk to you.

48
00:05:43,067 --> 00:05:45,800
This is Mr. Ford Maddox,
U.S. Department of Agriculture,

49
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:49,533
and Colonel Mattel, National Security
Commission, Avocado Affairs.

50
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,067
Avocado Affairs?

51
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,333
Miss Hunt, this is a a matter
of national importance.

52
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,567
We need to speak to you
immediately.

53
00:05:54,633 --> 00:05:56,600
Alone.

54
00:05:56,667 --> 00:06:00,767
Dr. Hunt, 98% of the avocados
produced in the United States

55
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,733
come from the stateof California.

56
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,400
Most of these come from a jungle
area that spreads from Bakersfield

57
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:09,300
to the Mexican border.

58
00:06:09,367 --> 00:06:10,867
The Avocado Belt.

59
00:06:10,933 --> 00:06:13,567
I'm aware of that.
What does it have to do with me?

60
00:06:13,633 --> 00:06:15,633
Miss Hunt,
maybe you don't get the point.

61
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,800
Avocados are vital to this
nation's security interests.

62
00:06:19,867 --> 00:06:22,533
The Communists are already
in control of Nicaragua and

63
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,933
Guatemala, and El Salvador's
rife with revolution.

64
00:06:25,067 --> 00:06:29,133
California is the last secure supply
of avocadoes in the free world.

65
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,267
We're on the verge of a major
avocado gap with the Soviet Union.

66
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:37,500
Back at the Kremlin, Gorbachev is
just chuckling over his taquitos.

67
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,600
I still don't see what that
has to do with me.

68
00:06:39,667 --> 00:06:42,567
Doctor, have you ever taken
a loyalty oath?

69
00:06:42,633 --> 00:06:45,233
Colonel, let me handle this.

70
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,067
As I was saying, most of the avocadoes
from the United States

71
00:06:48,133 --> 00:06:51,167
come from the avocado belt,
but they're harvested

72
00:06:51,233 --> 00:06:53,333
only on the perimeter of the jungle

73
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:59,233
because, as we all know, the interior
is completely wild and uncharted.

74
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,533
Anyone that strays too close to the heart
of the avocado jungle never returns.

75
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,367
Why?

76
00:07:05,433 --> 00:07:07,367
That's a very good question, Bunny.

77
00:07:09,467 --> 00:07:11,600
Perhaps Dr. Hunt would like
to answer it.

78
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,433
It's only a legend, really.

79
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,233
We're convinced that they're real.

80
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,300
Who?

81
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,167
The Piranha Women.

82
00:07:23,233 --> 00:07:25,867
Piranha Women, who are they?

83
00:07:25,933 --> 00:07:31,933
They're an ancient commune of
feminists, so radical, so militant,

84
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:35,167
so left of center, they...

85
00:07:35,233 --> 00:07:36,533
They eat their men.

86
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,133
Oh, that. Well, if I like a guy,
I usually...

87
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,433
They don't eat their men
like that, Bunny.

88
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,367
More like a black widow spider.

89
00:07:43,433 --> 00:07:45,600
They have sex with their men,
and they kill them.

90
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:48,600
Then they

91
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:52,767
tear them into strips like beef
jerky, and eat them with guacamole.

92
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:54,867
So legend has it.

93
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:58,167
They are more than a legend.
They're a major agricultural problem.

94
00:07:58,233 --> 00:08:03,767
It used to be safe for avocado pickers to
venture within 20 miles of the jungle's edge.

95
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:06,067
But lately the Piranha Women
have broadened their hold.

96
00:08:06,067 --> 00:08:08,933
No one is safe anywhere
in the avocado belt.

97
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:11,433
Well, if they're that much trouble,
why don't you just send in the troops

98
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,500
and round them up?

99
00:08:12,567 --> 00:08:13,567
Colonel Mattel?

100
00:08:14,233 --> 00:08:15,833
The fact is, we tried.

101
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:20,533
We sent in three divisions, armored
with air support.The best men we had.

102
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,700
And?

103
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:23,767
They got whupped.

104
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:29,100
They didn't play fair. Our men are trained
for state-of-the-art high-tech warfare.

105
00:08:29,167 --> 00:08:32,767
Those Piranha Women were
using knives and spears.

106
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:36,533
The officers got confused,
and they, well...

107
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,333
We found these at the edge of the jungle.

108
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,600
-Dog tags?
-Look closely.

109
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:45,733
They're covered with guacamole dip!

110
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,167
-Ew.
-Ew.

111
00:08:47,233 --> 00:08:49,300
Now do you get my point, Doctor?

112
00:08:49,367 --> 00:08:52,733
Your sisters in the jungle are
eating the few and the proud!

113
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,100
Control yourself, Colonel.

114
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:58,067
Look, naturally we would
prefer a military solution.

115
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,667
But, frankly, the U.S. military
hasn't had a lot of luck

116
00:09:00,733 --> 00:09:02,800
in jungle warfare lately.

117
00:09:02,867 --> 00:09:08,333
So, we're forced to negotiate with the
Piranha Women. That's where you come in.

118
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:14,700
We want you to go into the jungle and
try to reason with these man-eaters.

119
00:09:14,767 --> 00:09:16,467
I can't do that, Mr. Maddox.

120
00:09:16,533 --> 00:09:21,600
We just want the Piranha Women to
move out of The Avocado Jungle,

121
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:24,133
to a reservation in Malibu.

122
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:32,900
Deluxe condominiums. Pool,
sauna, ample parking.

123
00:09:32,967 --> 00:09:36,633
Total luxury living. We are even
willing, at the government's expense,

124
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:40,200
to convert the exercise room
so that they may maintain

125
00:09:40,267 --> 00:09:43,900
their bizarre sacrificial rituals.
Let me come to the point.

126
00:09:43,967 --> 00:09:47,067
We don't care if these girls
want to eat their men.

127
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,067
That's the Piranha Man's problem.

128
00:09:50,067 --> 00:09:53,600
We just want the avocadoes.

129
00:09:55,133 --> 00:09:56,700
And we're willing to pay for them.

130
00:09:58,467 --> 00:10:00,267
I'm sorry,
the answer's still no.

131
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,433
It's just like you girls
to stick together.

132
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,167
Why don't you tell us the real reason
you're not gonna go into that jungle?

133
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:14,433
You'd like to see the United States
humiliated by a Communist avocado yield!

134
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,967
I think you'd like to eat me
right now, wouldn't you, Dr. Hunt?

135
00:10:18,033 --> 00:10:20,100
-Dr. Hunt wouldn't...
-Colonel! Control yourself!

136
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,800
Dr. Hunt is a respected
middle-of-the-road feminist.

137
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,667
And I'm sure she'll be happy to cooperate
with us, especially when she considers

138
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:37,900
how much this university depends upon
grants from the Defense Department

139
00:10:37,967 --> 00:10:41,467
for its space weaponry program.

140
00:10:41,533 --> 00:10:48,100
And if Miss Hunt, Dr. Hunt, is still
unable to see the logic in assisting us,

141
00:10:48,167 --> 00:10:52,067
why, I'm sure Dean Stockwell will
explain it to her. Won't you, Dean?

142
00:10:54,300 --> 00:11:01,100
Now, now, now, gentlemen. I will
not tolerate tactics of this kind.

143
00:11:01,167 --> 00:11:03,733
This university is a bastion
of intellectual freedom,

144
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,733
and I am sworn to protect that freedom.

145
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,500
I will not tolerate my professors
being coerced into anything

146
00:11:10,567 --> 00:11:15,100
against their will, no matter how much
political pressure is put on me personally.

147
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:23,133
Margo, you will do exactly as they tell
you, or I will cut your funding off,

148
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,700
and you can kiss your tenure
goodbye. Comprehendo?

149
00:11:25,767 --> 00:11:27,400
M-hm.

150
00:11:27,467 --> 00:11:31,633
The real question here is whether
or not this projectis worthy of

151
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,933
Spritzer College's involvement.
What do you say, Doc?

152
00:11:35,967 --> 00:11:37,767
I guess I'm going in the jungle.

153
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:39,933
That's terrific. Nice seeing you.

154
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:41,167
Thanks again for your help, Dean.

155
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:42,500
Oh, any time.

156
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:44,700
Mr. Maddox.

157
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,967
There's something
you're not telling me.

158
00:11:47,067 --> 00:11:48,867
Why? What do you mean?

159
00:11:48,933 --> 00:11:51,067
You don't expect me to believe
I'm the first feminist

160
00:11:51,133 --> 00:11:53,333
you sent in to try to reason
with the Piranha Women.

161
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,200
What's really going on
in that jungle?

162
00:11:55,267 --> 00:11:58,133
I suppose you have the right
to know the truth.

163
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:03,800
Two years ago, we sent into The Avocado Jungle
the leading feminist scholar, Dr. Kurtz.

164
00:12:03,867 --> 00:12:05,833
Dr. Kurtz?

165
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:09,833
Internationally famous author of
Smart Women, Stupid, Insensitive Men?

166
00:12:10,233 --> 00:12:11,833
Yes.

167
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,967
That explains her suddendis
appearance from the talk-show circuit.

168
00:12:15,767 --> 00:12:17,767
What happened to her?

169
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:21,600
We really don't know. She may have been killed,
or perhaps they're holding her prisoner.

170
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:25,367
It was shortly after her expedition that
the Piranha Women went on the rampage.

171
00:12:26,567 --> 00:12:31,500
Well, I guess, now that
you know, you refuse to go?

172
00:12:33,067 --> 00:12:36,567
Quite the contrary.
Now I know I must go.

173
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:40,833
No, Bunny, you can't come.

174
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,500
But, Dr. Hunt,
why can't I go with you?

175
00:12:42,567 --> 00:12:46,700
Bunny, look, nobody's ever returned
from The Avocado Jungle.

176
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:49,167
There'll be countless dangers
and perils along the way.

177
00:12:49,233 --> 00:12:51,700
I can't take a sophomore
into the wilderness.

178
00:12:51,767 --> 00:12:53,467
You don't have the skills
or training.

179
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:56,200
And, besides, you haven't even
finished your general ed requirements.

180
00:12:56,267 --> 00:12:58,633
Now, I'm sorry, Bunny.
It's just too dangerous.

181
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,067
Bunny, baby! Hey,
good-looking! How you doing?

182
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,300
-Hi, Chuckie.
-Hi.

183
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:11,633
Bunny, babe, the super party boys at the
Delta Epsilon are having another super party

184
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,067
this Friday night.
You're not doing anything, are you?

185
00:13:15,133 --> 00:13:17,867
Well, I wanted to do something,
but I guess I'm not.

186
00:13:17,933 --> 00:13:22,300
Great! Great, look, this is going
to be a toga partyand a beer bust.

187
00:13:22,367 --> 00:13:27,367
And, for special girls like you, we are
going to be having a wet t-shirt contest.

188
00:13:27,433 --> 00:13:29,267
But all my t-shirts are dry.

189
00:13:31,967 --> 00:13:36,167
Bunny! Don't worry about that. The fraternity
brothers, we're going to take care of you.

190
00:13:37,367 --> 00:13:39,233
Did you ever do anymud wrestling?

191
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,467
-I...
-You're coming with me.

192
00:13:41,533 --> 00:13:44,400
-I get to go?
-You'd be safer in the jungle.

193
00:13:44,467 --> 00:13:46,233
Bye, Chuckie.

194
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,067
Patricia, have those filing
cabinets I orderedcome in yet?

195
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:52,100
No, I've had them on
back order for two weeks.

196
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:57,100
Hm. Never mind. I'm going to do some
field research, and I need some supplies.

197
00:13:57,167 --> 00:14:02,433
Okay, three legal-size pads,
ten manila envelopes,

198
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:08,767
a Dictaphone recorder,
and four one-hour tapes.

199
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:11,700
I'll need a Bowie knife,
a first-aid kit,

200
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:16,567
100 feet of nylon mountain climbing
rope, a breach-loading revolver,

201
00:14:16,633 --> 00:14:18,067
and holster.

202
00:14:19,767 --> 00:14:21,767
A thousand rounds of ammunition.

203
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:25,233
Full metal jacket, hollow point,
or teflon coated?

204
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,533
Which do you think would be best for
fighting the dangers that lurk inside

205
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,967
a hostile jungle environment?

206
00:14:30,067 --> 00:14:33,733
I would alternate hollow and
teflon bullets in the chamber.

207
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:39,867
That way, you have maximum stopping power,
but still armor-piercing capability.

208
00:14:45,433 --> 00:14:48,767
Dr. Hunt! Yoo-hoo!

209
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,800
Yoo-hoo! I'm ready.

210
00:14:52,867 --> 00:14:56,900
Oh, Bunny, don't you think you could have
worn something a little more practical?

211
00:14:56,967 --> 00:14:58,300
We're going into uncharted jungle.

212
00:14:58,367 --> 00:15:00,700
Well, I did prepare a flask
in my suitcase.

213
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,067
Well, never mind. If you get in
trouble you can wearsomething of mine.

214
00:15:06,067 --> 00:15:07,067
Oh, good.

215
00:15:10,967 --> 00:15:13,867
And I brought along some great
lingerie we can share.

216
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:44,867
Why do the Piranha Women
eat their men?

217
00:15:44,933 --> 00:15:47,900
Well, primitive cultures often
use overly simplistic methods

218
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:50,733
of dealing withinter-tribal conflicts.

219
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,867
The Piranha Women probably figured that the
problems that arise between men and women

220
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:58,533
naturally in any relationship are
best solved by ritualized killing.

221
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,500
Do a lot of feminists eat men?

222
00:16:02,567 --> 00:16:03,733
No, Bunny.

223
00:16:04,933 --> 00:16:06,467
Well, not many.

224
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:09,467
You have to understand that
the Piranha Women are

225
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:12,533
a primitive, ancient, radical
offshoot of the women's movement.

226
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,067
And most feminists,
like myself and Dr. Kurtz,

227
00:16:15,133 --> 00:16:19,633
we believe in equality between the sexes,
not the domination of women over men.

228
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:23,533
And there aren't any modern
feminists that advocate cannibalism.

229
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,267
At least not since the sixties.

230
00:16:27,067 --> 00:16:28,300
*

231
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:50,533
San Bernardino. A rough speck of
civilization on the edge of the avocado belt.

232
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,400
We'll head down to some local establishments
and see if we can find a mercenary

233
00:16:53,467 --> 00:16:55,333
to guide us through the jungle.

234
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,433
I've never been to
San Bernardino before.

235
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,867
Don't worry, Bunny,

236
00:17:02,167 --> 00:17:03,433
we'll be all right.

237
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,133
Hey, chickies, can I buy you a drink?

238
00:17:39,733 --> 00:17:40,800
No, thanks.

239
00:17:42,167 --> 00:17:44,500
When I offer a chick a drink,
I ex...

240
00:17:44,567 --> 00:17:47,467
I am not a chick.
I'm an ethnohistorian

241
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:50,200
with a doctorate in cultural
anthropology. Got that?

242
00:17:50,267 --> 00:17:51,967
-Yes, Doctor.
-Good.

243
00:17:52,067 --> 00:17:54,767
Now, I understand that your compulsion
to assaultwomen verbally

244
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:57,667
stems from a constant exposure
to violent and sexist images

245
00:17:57,733 --> 00:18:02,533
from a male dominated media. Therefore,
I won't blow a hole in your head.

246
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,600
Thank you.

247
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:20,433
I'm from the department of feminist
studies at Spritzer College.

248
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,400
I want to hire a mercenary
for a very dangerous job.

249
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,667
(GROWLING)

250
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,733
I'm Anvil.

251
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:36,600
A crazy, ex-Vietnam vet who hires
himself out tothe highest bidder.

252
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:44,400
I can rape, pillage, and napalm
an entire South Asian village

253
00:18:44,467 --> 00:18:46,467
single-handedly.

254
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:58,467
I'm Bushito,
the world's greatest ninja.

255
00:18:58,533 --> 00:19:01,967
I am a killing machine,
master of all the deadly arts.

256
00:19:02,067 --> 00:19:07,167
And if you need a mercenary to
kill and to maim, I am the best.

257
00:19:22,733 --> 00:19:28,167
I am the Black-Masked Avenger!
World-champion wrestler

258
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:33,567
and weight-lifter.
I don't need no weapons or guns.

259
00:19:33,633 --> 00:19:37,433
I can crush men with my bare hands.

260
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:44,333
I can squish 'em, smash 'em
and throttle them! Look at this!

261
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:02,733
So, what is your job?

262
00:20:03,767 --> 00:20:06,500
You wanna burn down a small town?

263
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,433
Attack animpenetrable fortress?

264
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,067
Or crush an army of enemies?

265
00:20:12,133 --> 00:20:14,833
I need a guide to take
meto The Avocado Jungle.

266
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,833
ALL TOGETHER: The Avocado Jungle?

267
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,200
I want to make contact
with the Piranha Women.

268
00:20:20,267 --> 00:20:22,200
ALL TOGETHER: The Piranha Women?

269
00:20:25,033 --> 00:20:30,333
Excuse me, Miss, I've got to go to
the Veterans' Center for some counseling.

270
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,100
Maybe next time.

271
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:36,133
I forgot, I'm busy. There's a
showing of The Seven Samurai

272
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,567
tonight and... Bye.

273
00:20:41,133 --> 00:20:44,667
I've got to go on Nutri system,
yes. Lose a little weight.

274
00:20:44,733 --> 00:20:47,033
A jungle trip is out of
the question right now.

275
00:20:48,867 --> 00:20:50,767
Well, let that be a lesson
to you, Bunny.

276
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:54,567
A bunch of violent brutes wrapped up
in a blanket of male machismo.

277
00:20:54,633 --> 00:20:58,333
They're happy to victimize the helpless,
but one thing sends them scurrying away.

278
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,500
One thing strips their phony courage.
The threat of a strong woman.

279
00:21:03,567 --> 00:21:08,833
Not so fast, Dr. Margo Hunt,
Ms. Ethnohistorian.

280
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,567
There's still some real men
left in this world,

281
00:21:11,633 --> 00:21:15,433
men who haven't been cast rated by
the years of feminist propaganda that

282
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,167
corrupted the public school system
and infectedprime-time television.

283
00:21:19,233 --> 00:21:23,367
Men who believe that Nature designed
women to cook,nurture children

284
00:21:23,433 --> 00:21:26,700
and pose for Penthouse Magazine.
Real men

285
00:21:26,767 --> 00:21:30,133
who say our role in this world
is to love, protect

286
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,600
and, yes, I'm not afraid to
say it, dominate women.

287
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,533
(CRASHING)

288
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:44,633
I'll go into the avocado jungle with you.
I'll lead you to the Piranha Women.

289
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,733
I'm man enough to face the dangers that
lurk in the dark bosom of the jungle.

290
00:21:50,133 --> 00:21:51,667
(GROWLING)

291
00:21:53,067 --> 00:21:54,233
(SCREAMING)

292
00:22:04,233 --> 00:22:06,667
I'm not afraid of the Piranha Women

293
00:22:06,733 --> 00:22:10,900
any more than I am of
a certain ethnohistorian who,

294
00:22:10,967 --> 00:22:14,300
terrified of her own frailty
and need to be loved,

295
00:22:14,367 --> 00:22:19,400
abandoned her femininity in a bizarre
charade of scholarship and androgyny.

296
00:22:19,467 --> 00:22:21,467
Jim, what are you doing here?

297
00:22:21,533 --> 00:22:23,500
You know him, Dr. Hunt?

298
00:22:23,567 --> 00:22:28,133
Sure she knows me, Bunny. Dr. Hunt and
I are old friends, aren't we, Margo?

299
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,100
Well...

300
00:22:30,167 --> 00:22:34,200
We were in love once, desperately
and passionately in love.

301
00:22:34,267 --> 00:22:37,400
But that was a long time ago,
wasn't it, Margo?

302
00:22:37,467 --> 00:22:41,067
Back when your mind wasn't filled
with bizarre feminist notions about

303
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,300
the meaninglessness of love.

304
00:22:43,367 --> 00:22:46,767
Back then, you were the most giving,
passionate women I'd ever met in my life.

305
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:49,833
I turned my whole world
upside-down for you.

306
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:54,700
We share our innermost thoughts and
feelings. We made plans, big plans,

307
00:22:54,767 --> 00:22:59,867
plans for a life together. And then you
dumped me flatbecause I didn't turn out

308
00:23:00,067 --> 00:23:03,133
to be the sort of man who fit in
neatly with the feminist tommyrot

309
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,500
you were being force-fed
by your professors.

310
00:23:05,567 --> 00:23:09,300
It was a one-night stand. I was half-drunk
and left right after we had sex.

311
00:23:09,367 --> 00:23:12,500
We didn't say eight words to each other,
and all yours were composed of one syllable.

312
00:23:12,567 --> 00:23:16,133
Ha! Just like you to count
the words, Dr. Hunt.

313
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,967
But what you never understood is there
are some feelings that can't be measured

314
00:23:19,067 --> 00:23:21,567
in words, some moments that
last an eternity.

315
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:24,967
You toyed with my affections and, after
you crushed my heart, I crawled into

316
00:23:25,067 --> 00:23:27,067
a whiskey bottle,
and I haven't come out since.

317
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,733
You left for Hawaii the next day
with the bimbo in the cafeteria.

318
00:23:33,467 --> 00:23:38,067
Well, yeah, but I had made
that date a week before.

319
00:23:38,067 --> 00:23:41,100
And, besides, the second
I got back from Hawaii, I...

320
00:23:41,167 --> 00:23:43,800
I crawled into a whiskey bottle,
and I haven't come out since.

321
00:23:43,867 --> 00:23:45,700
Ugh, let's go, Bunny.

322
00:23:45,767 --> 00:23:50,567
Wait! You said you needed a guide.
Well, I'm the best.

323
00:23:50,633 --> 00:23:53,733
Well, I've changed my mind.
We'll do without one.

324
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,933
Fat chance. You won't last ten
minutes in that jungle without me.

325
00:23:58,067 --> 00:23:59,667
I can take care of myself.

326
00:23:59,733 --> 00:24:02,267
Not in The Avocado Jungle, you can't.

327
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:05,500
Do you know what jungle herb cures the
poisonous bite of the river snake?

328
00:24:05,567 --> 00:24:08,200
Do you know where the only land
route is around the waters of death?

329
00:24:08,267 --> 00:24:11,767
Do you know the way through the secret maze
caves that lie underneath Hangman's Cliff?

330
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:13,333
Huh? Do you?

331
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,567
Well, no, I don't. Do you?

332
00:24:17,633 --> 00:24:21,067
Well, no, but I have this paperback.

333
00:24:22,467 --> 00:24:23,767
I'll buy my own book.

334
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:24,833
It's out of print.

335
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,267
You as a guide? How much?

336
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:34,067
Oh, isn't that fine! Just like you to
treat me like a gigolo and offer me money,

337
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,500
after all we meant to each other.

338
00:24:35,567 --> 00:24:37,100
-How much
-$25,000.

339
00:24:37,167 --> 00:24:38,167
-Forget it. -Fifty bucks?

340
00:24:38,233 --> 00:24:39,233
Okay.

341
00:24:41,267 --> 00:24:44,433
That's fifty, plus expenses.

342
00:24:46,233 --> 00:24:50,100
Now, Jim, I don't care what happened
to us before. That's all in the past.

343
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:53,400
I've hired you as a guide with the
understanding that our relationship will be

344
00:24:53,467 --> 00:24:55,400
strictly professional
from here on in.

345
00:24:55,467 --> 00:24:57,200
Whatever you say, honey buns.

346
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,533
Get out.

347
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,833
Okay. Okay, you're right.
I just slipped.

348
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,633
Strictly professional. If that's the
way you want it, that's the way it'll be.

349
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,700
I'll be good, really. I promise.

350
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,467
(TIRES SKIDDING)

351
00:25:17,667 --> 00:25:20,167
I guess sharing a sleeping bag
is out, then?

*

353
00:25:38,967 --> 00:25:42,633
This is it. The Avocado Jungle.

354
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,567
It doesn't look like a jungle.

355
00:25:44,633 --> 00:25:47,467
Hm. The outer regions
aren't very overgrown,

356
00:25:47,533 --> 00:25:50,433
but the foliage gets
thicker the deeper you go.

357
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,067
We're going to have to leave the
jeep here and continue on foot.

358
00:25:53,133 --> 00:25:56,300
Yeah, well, you girls better
hang back. This could be dangerous.

359
00:25:56,367 --> 00:25:57,767
We don't want to make any misstep.

360
00:25:57,833 --> 00:25:59,067
(CRASHING) Oh, geez!

361
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,067
BUNNY: Are you okay?

362
00:26:01,067 --> 00:26:04,367
Yeah. Yeah,
just checking the tires.

363
00:26:04,433 --> 00:26:09,067
Yeah, they're good.
I'll look at the oil later.

364
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,667
He wrecked my nails.

365
00:26:15,433 --> 00:26:20,733
Here it is. The Avocado Jungle.
Look around you, Bunny.

366
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:26,067
In front of us, the lush, untouched
rainforest of the last surviving matriarchy.

367
00:26:26,067 --> 00:26:29,933
Behind us, the polluted patriarchy
of Western civilization.

368
00:26:30,067 --> 00:26:35,400
We're leaving a world dominated by
men and entering one ruled by women.

369
00:26:35,467 --> 00:26:39,067
Whup-de-doo. Just keep bashing men.
In a couple of days, you'll be

370
00:26:39,067 --> 00:26:41,200
dying for a Burger Kingout here.

371
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:42,667
I doubt it.

372
00:26:42,733 --> 00:26:45,833
Yeah, you women are always
bitching and moaning about

373
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,400
men and the way we run things, but,
let's face it. Who could have ever invented

374
00:26:49,467 --> 00:26:53,200
but a man, the 64 GTO? Or, for
that matter, the Corvette Stingray,

375
00:26:53,267 --> 00:26:56,833
any year, any model? All you
women have ever done is, what?

376
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,800
Some French chick invented
kryptonite or something.

377
00:26:59,867 --> 00:27:02,467
The important things like beer
and meat, that was all men.

378
00:27:02,533 --> 00:27:04,867
Yeah, it's hard to imagine
a woman inventing nuclear weapons.

379
00:27:04,933 --> 00:27:06,600
Exactly.
And where would webe without them?

380
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:08,833
The Nazi blitzkrieg seemed
like a male idea, not to mention

381
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,833
South African apartheid.
How about World War I? The Crusades?

382
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,767
The Spanish Inquisition?
The rape of Shanghai?

383
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:16,367
BUNNY: So men have done
a lot of things.

384
00:27:18,133 --> 00:27:20,233
-Elvis Presley.
-Janis Joplin.

385
00:27:21,067 --> 00:27:22,633
-Patton.
-Joan of Arc.

386
00:27:23,733 --> 00:27:24,933
How about Tammy Bakker?

387
00:27:25,067 --> 00:27:26,967
Jim Bakker, Jerry Falwell,
Jimmy Swaggart.

388
00:27:27,067 --> 00:27:28,933
Jessica Hunt, Fawn Hall...

389
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:33,700
Josephy McCarthy.
Richard Nixon.

390
00:27:33,767 --> 00:27:35,600
Joan Rivers.

391
00:27:35,667 --> 00:27:38,300
Joan Rivers? I like Joan Rivers.
I think she's funny.

392
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:39,700
Well, I think Nixon's funny.

393
00:28:01,067 --> 00:28:02,533
Jim, what are you doing?

394
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,367
Hacking out a trail through
the underbrush.

395
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:09,200
A trail? You're just hacking
at branches on the side.

396
00:28:09,267 --> 00:28:13,167
Yeah, but I just bought the machete.
It seemed likea shame not to use it.

397
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,933
Anyway, it's good practice for when
the jungle really gets thick, you know?

398
00:28:16,067 --> 00:28:18,700
Sometimes I swing two or three,
then it's really light.

399
00:28:18,767 --> 00:28:21,133
I think you look really
handsome with a machete.

400
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,333
Well, thank you, Bunny.

401
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,767
Come on, you two. We've gota lot
of ground to cover before night.

402
00:28:26,833 --> 00:28:27,833
Girls in front of boys.

403
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,267
-No, no. Boy, girl, boy, girl.
-No.

404
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:30,533
No, that's the way you do it in the jungle.

405
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,600
No!

406
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,967
Hey. Want some?

407
00:28:35,067 --> 00:28:36,067
Yeah.

408
00:28:37,433 --> 00:28:38,800
What is that?

409
00:28:38,867 --> 00:28:39,900
Pina colada.

410
00:28:41,067 --> 00:28:42,867
Where's Bunny?

411
00:28:42,933 --> 00:28:44,767
That's funny. She was right...

412
00:28:45,533 --> 00:28:46,533
-Bunny?
-Bunny!

413
00:28:47,467 --> 00:28:48,733
-Bunny!
-Bunny!

414
00:28:51,933 --> 00:28:54,233
Kitty? Oh, you're so sweet.

415
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:57,367
Kitty? Here. Oh!

416
00:28:58,733 --> 00:29:00,733
Good kitty. Nice kitty.

417
00:29:01,733 --> 00:29:04,100
Are you lost? Huh?

418
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,967
Where's your home?

419
00:29:07,067 --> 00:29:08,900
What do you like to eat?

420
00:29:08,967 --> 00:29:11,233
Ooh, look at your eyes!

421
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,567
JIM: Bunny!

422
00:29:12,633 --> 00:29:13,733
Oh, no.

423
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,800
DR. HUNT: Bunny!

424
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,300
Bye.

425
00:29:20,533 --> 00:29:21,867
Bye.

426
00:29:21,933 --> 00:29:22,933
Coming!

427
00:29:26,633 --> 00:29:28,267
JIM: Bunny!

428
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:29,633
DR. HUNT: Bunny!

429
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:32,367
Oh, her curling iron.

430
00:29:32,433 --> 00:29:34,167
And her Indiana Jones lunch box.

431
00:29:35,067 --> 00:29:36,900
Bunny!

432
00:29:36,967 --> 00:29:40,300
Whoa! Look at all this stuff! Milk Duds,
Good 'N Plenty, Nutty Buddies!

433
00:29:40,367 --> 00:29:42,600
I had a feeling she was
holding out on us.

434
00:29:42,667 --> 00:29:44,567
Bunny!

435
00:29:44,633 --> 00:29:46,433
I just found a big kitty.

436
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,967
Where have you been? Don't you know
it's dangerous in the jungle?

437
00:29:49,067 --> 00:29:51,100
Didn't you know it's dangerous
to hold out on your friends?

438
00:29:51,167 --> 00:29:52,167
-Give me that.
-Ow!

439
00:29:53,767 --> 00:29:55,067
Do you have a band-aid?

440
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:04,933
You don't have any idea
where we are?

441
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,700
Of course I know where we are.
I know exactly where we are.

442
00:30:07,767 --> 00:30:08,767
Oh, good.

443
00:30:08,833 --> 00:30:09,933
We're...

444
00:30:11,767 --> 00:30:13,033
Let me see that.

445
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,967
Honey, honey, honey, please!

446
00:30:16,033 --> 00:30:18,767
I know you think you know
everything about everything,

447
00:30:18,833 --> 00:30:22,067
but when it comes to reading maps,
I happen to be an expert.

448
00:30:22,133 --> 00:30:25,900
All right. Now, our best chance of
finding the Piranha Women is to take

449
00:30:25,967 --> 00:30:30,667
the Rio Santa Rosa river. It runs
the length of The Avocado Jungle,

450
00:30:30,733 --> 00:30:33,667
and it is, I believe, their
primary source of fresh water.

451
00:30:33,733 --> 00:30:37,300
Well, maybe we can build
a raft and float downstream.

452
00:30:37,367 --> 00:30:41,600
Yeah, good. Whatever. All right.
Now, according to my calculations,

453
00:30:41,667 --> 00:30:44,933
with the north star overhead,

454
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,867
and the moon rising easterly, and
allowing for a wind factor of five,

455
00:30:49,933 --> 00:30:53,633
the river should be approximately
23.6 miles away.

456
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,333
It should take us about
two days to get there.

457
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,267
Twenty-three miles?

458
00:30:57,333 --> 00:31:00,100
But the jungle is so lush and green
around here. Are you sure it's not closer?

459
00:31:00,167 --> 00:31:01,400
I mean...

460
00:31:01,467 --> 00:31:03,733
Sweetie, sweetie, sweetie, please!

461
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:07,100
If there's one thing I know,
it's how to read a map.

462
00:31:07,167 --> 00:31:10,300
Now, if you will excuse me,
I'm gotta to go tothe little boy's room.

463
00:31:10,367 --> 00:31:13,233
Make yourselves busy.
God, women! You know?

464
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,967
They thing they know
about everything...

465
00:31:16,067 --> 00:31:17,367
(SCREAMING)
(SPLASHING)

466
00:31:19,367 --> 00:31:20,833
I think he found the river.

467
00:31:29,567 --> 00:31:31,800
Maybe that isn'tthe North Star.

468
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:37,967
They're all dry now, but I want
to get the wrinkles out.

469
00:31:38,067 --> 00:31:41,833
Maybe you could put a neat military
crease across the front panels

470
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,900
of the pants and shirt.

471
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:43,967
Oh, sure!

472
00:31:45,233 --> 00:31:47,100
You sure are a good little
homemaker, Bunny.

473
00:31:47,167 --> 00:31:50,267
Thanks. I've been taking home
economics for two years now.

474
00:31:50,333 --> 00:31:53,200
But I'm switching my major
to feminist studies.

475
00:31:53,267 --> 00:31:54,767
What do you want to do that for?

476
00:31:54,833 --> 00:31:56,100
I want to expand my mind.

477
00:31:57,433 --> 00:32:00,067
Hm. Why?

478
00:32:00,133 --> 00:32:03,767
Gee, I don't know. Maybe I could become
the first woman president or something.

479
00:32:08,933 --> 00:32:11,067
I followed the river
for about half a mile.

480
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,833
There's the wreckage of
small boat near the shore.

481
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:17,967
Now, if it's salvage able,
we could use it to travel downstream.

482
00:32:18,067 --> 00:32:20,700
I wonder what it was doing
this deep into the jungle.

483
00:32:20,767 --> 00:32:21,867
The Patna.

484
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,900
You know it?

485
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,700
Yes. Yes, I know it.

486
00:32:30,533 --> 00:32:36,967
It was a long, long time ago.
I was young, very young, and stupid.

487
00:32:37,067 --> 00:32:42,367
Very stupid. I made a mistake.
A nasty business.

488
00:32:42,433 --> 00:32:45,233
I panicked, got drummed out
of the Merchant Marine.

489
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:48,867
I spent the next three years of my life
criss-crossing the globe, trying to live it down.

490
00:32:50,567 --> 00:32:53,600
I'm sorry.
I don't want to talk about it.

491
00:32:53,667 --> 00:32:54,900
Whatever.

492
00:32:54,967 --> 00:32:57,100
After that, I crawled
into a whiskey bot...

493
00:32:57,167 --> 00:32:59,500
Ah, Jim, please!
Not the whiskey bottle again.

494
00:33:04,633 --> 00:33:07,533
Poor Jimmy doesn't have a tent.

495
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,100
Bunny, he'll be all right.
It's a warm night.

496
00:33:11,167 --> 00:33:14,067
Listen. Isn't that beautiful?

497
00:33:14,133 --> 00:33:15,467
(HARMONICA MUSIC PLAYING)

498
00:33:18,867 --> 00:33:20,167
He is awfully good.

499
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,400
You're kind of tough on him.

500
00:33:39,967 --> 00:33:40,967
Yeah.

501
00:33:41,867 --> 00:33:43,167
He said he loved you.

502
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:48,333
I doubt that. And it never
would have worked out.

503
00:33:49,633 --> 00:33:53,400
He's an egotistical, chauvinistic klutz.

504
00:33:53,467 --> 00:33:55,067
I think he's kind of cute.

505
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,867
Well, maybe I am a little hard on him.

506
00:34:02,933 --> 00:34:07,167
Bunny, it's just that here
presents my failures.

507
00:34:07,233 --> 00:34:09,467
Failures? You?

508
00:34:09,533 --> 00:34:13,667
Sure, we all have them. Can I tell you
a secret I've never told anyone before?

509
00:34:13,733 --> 00:34:15,067
Sure.

510
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:20,233
In a way, Jim is right.
I am afraid of men.

511
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:26,133
My relationships have been, well,
I've had a lot ofone-night stands.

512
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:29,300
A little to drink, you know,
to give myself an excuse,

513
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:33,633
and I subconsciously fall for jerks I know
I'll never be emotionally involved with.

514
00:34:35,067 --> 00:34:38,300
It's all so empty.
Passionless, really.

515
00:34:39,567 --> 00:34:42,600
I guess deep down I'm afraid

516
00:34:42,667 --> 00:34:48,100
that there can never be anyrespect or
equality between the sexes. Not really.

517
00:34:48,167 --> 00:34:50,600
I've avoided commitment because
I'm afraid I'll be

518
00:34:50,667 --> 00:34:56,567
emotionally dominated by my lover or,
equally as sad, that I'd dominate him.

519
00:34:58,633 --> 00:35:00,667
I guess that seems kind of strange, huh?

520
00:35:00,733 --> 00:35:04,633
Can I tell you something, too, Dr. Hunt?
Something I've never told anybody before?

521
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:07,233
Of course, Bunny.
I'm glad we got to share this.

522
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:12,500
Well, sometimes when I'm with a guy, I wish
that he'd tie me up with red licorice ropes

523
00:35:12,567 --> 00:35:17,200
and then spank me, and then
he'd eat the ropes,

524
00:35:17,267 --> 00:35:23,167
and then he'd free me, and then we'd make
love while the Philharmonic played Bolero.

525
00:35:24,867 --> 00:35:29,700
Thank you, Bunny. You really
put my thoughts in perspective.

526
00:35:29,767 --> 00:35:31,233
I feel better, too.

527
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:35,567
Hey, you want some red licorice?

528
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:37,767
No, thanks.

529
00:35:37,833 --> 00:35:40,833
How about you, Bun?
Come on, it's a foot-long.

530
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,367
Start on the end.
I'll meet you in the middle.

531
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,300
No, thanks.

532
00:35:45,967 --> 00:35:46,967
Suit yourself.

534
00:35:54,633 --> 00:35:57,067
Let's see if this boat floats,
huh? What do you say?

535
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:00,400
And over here on the left, we have
the tribal headhunter and trader.

536
00:36:00,467 --> 00:36:03,267
He's got a special for us
today. It's a two-for-one.

537
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:06,900
Two of his heads for one of
yours. Do we have any takers?

538
00:36:06,967 --> 00:36:10,167
Boy, this is incredible. You've
memorized the entire speech

539
00:36:10,233 --> 00:36:11,967
in the jungle boat ride
at Disneyland.

540
00:36:12,067 --> 00:36:13,133
That'll be useful.

541
00:36:14,067 --> 00:36:15,567
I can do the Tiki Room, too.

542
00:36:15,633 --> 00:36:17,433
-You know everything!
-Can you steer a boat?

543
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,700
Hey, I know Adventureland
like the back of my hand.

544
00:36:23,767 --> 00:36:26,067
Of course, this jungle can't
be much different.

(LOUD NOISE)

546
00:36:27,167 --> 00:36:28,333
What was that?

547
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,200
Something went under the boat.
Something big.

548
00:36:30,267 --> 00:36:31,933
Ah, it's probably just a rock.

549
00:36:32,467 --> 00:36:33,467
Hardly.

550
00:36:35,867 --> 00:36:37,333
A hippo, look!

551
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,900
A hippo? In California?

552
00:36:39,967 --> 00:36:42,867
The Palm Springs hippo. It's a lighter
version than its African cousin

553
00:36:42,933 --> 00:36:46,400
because of the low-cholesterol
diet. But it's just as deadly.

554
00:36:46,467 --> 00:36:48,067
Oh, my God!
It's trying to get the boat!

555
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,600
-We're going to die!
-Man the helm!

556
00:36:49,667 --> 00:36:53,200
Don't let it broadside us, Jim!
Hard to port! Hard to port!

557
00:36:53,267 --> 00:36:54,867
Port? Is that left or right?
I...

558
00:36:54,933 --> 00:36:56,533
Left! Left!

561
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,500
I think so.

562
00:37:01,567 --> 00:37:05,233
Boy! Did its ears wiggle when it
started to get close to us?

563
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,333
Yeah, their ears wiggle
when they're angry.

564
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,533
Yeah.

565
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,400
This is not the Disneyland
jungle boat ride!

566
00:37:11,467 --> 00:37:13,767
Get real, folks,
we were almost killed!

Sh!

00:37:53,633 --> 00:37:54,733
Someone's in the bushes.

570
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,967
I hear something.

571
00:37:56,067 --> 00:37:57,433
BUNNY: The Piranha Women?

572
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,267
Oh, Lordy!

573
00:38:01,333 --> 00:38:02,333
Get down!

574
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,533
They're attacking! Oh!

575
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,200
I'm coming!

576
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,867
Where does it hurt?

577
00:38:11,933 --> 00:38:15,333
I can't tell.
I think I'm in shock.

578
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,633
-Am I bleeding?
-No.

579
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:22,100
What was it that did me in?
A rock, a spear,

580
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:24,067
an arrow?

581
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,367
It looks like a knitted
potholder to me.

582
00:38:26,433 --> 00:38:28,067
It looks like a doily.

583
00:38:30,067 --> 00:38:32,933
It's a crocheted pot holder.

584
00:38:33,067 --> 00:38:36,333
Boy, those Piranha Women are
stupider than I thought.

585
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,867
What do they think they're going
to get attacking us with doilies

586
00:38:38,933 --> 00:38:40,567
and pot holders, and placemats?

587
00:38:40,633 --> 00:38:44,167
You know, women today are just
not the way I thought they would be.

588
00:38:44,233 --> 00:38:46,867
Well, I don't think
it's the Piranha Women.

589
00:38:46,933 --> 00:38:48,667
Whoever it is, they're gone now.

590
00:38:49,733 --> 00:38:51,133
Let's go investigate.

591
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,367
Wait! They could have flatware.
It might be dangerous.

592
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:57,633
Why would someone attack us
with pot holders?

593
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:00,267
Well, maybe it wasn't meant
as an attack.

594
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:02,733
Maybe it was meant as an offering.

595
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,500
JIM: An offering?

596
00:39:04,567 --> 00:39:06,067
-You don't mean...
-Yes.

597

Oh, let's go back to the boat.

599
00:39:09,267 --> 00:39:13,167
No, we can't go back. We want to be
the first outsiders ever to make contact.

00:39:13,233 --> 00:39:15,067
-JIM: They're disgusting!
-BUNNY: Who?

601

DR. HUNT:
They're not disgusting.

602
00:39:16,867 --> 00:39:19,600
You think that anyone that chooses
to live their lifedifferently than you

603
00:39:19,667 --> 00:39:24,467
is disgusting. Well, different lifestyles
have different traditions, Jim.

604
00:39:24,533 --> 00:39:26,900
So do worms, but I don't have
the stomach to look at them.

605

BUNNY: Who?

606
00:39:28,467 --> 00:39:31,300
It's just a legend, really.
But in The Avocado Jungle,

607
00:39:31,367 --> 00:39:34,067
there's a tribe of men who live
apart from the Piranha Women...

608
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,233
And I'm cowering in fear of them.

609
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:40,133
They have different cultures, Jim.
They're really very caring and nurturing.

610
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,567
They're a bunch of weenies!

611
00:39:41,633 --> 00:39:43,133
They make pot holders?

612
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,533
Well, they make baked goods,
sew their own clothes,

613
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:51,067
and they leave out handicrafts for the Piranha
Women, and, in return, they don't eat them.

614
00:39:51,133 --> 00:39:54,067
Kind of a symbiotic relationship.

615
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,867
Kind of an idiotic relationship,
is more like it.

616
00:39:58,167 --> 00:39:59,400
What are they called?

617
00:39:59,467 --> 00:40:00,900
The Donnahews.

618
00:40:00,967 --> 00:40:02,633
Come on out! Don't be afraid!

We promise!

620

Don't be afraid! Look!

00:40:18,067 --> 00:40:20,300
It's a different culture, Jim.

624
00:40:20,367 --> 00:40:21,933
I think they're sweet.

Oh, thank you, no, I'm stuffed.
Really. It was all delicious, though.

00:40:58,467 --> 00:40:59,800
Alan Alda?

634
00:40:59,867 --> 00:41:00,967
Thank you, no.

635
00:41:01,067 --> 00:41:02,667
Oh, yes, thank you.

636
00:41:02,733 --> 00:41:06,433
This tuna fish casserole is a dream.
And the stuffed bell peppers,

637
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:09,300
they're so good.
Aren't they really good cooks?

638
00:41:09,367 --> 00:41:11,400
Really good wimps, is what they are.

639
00:41:11,467 --> 00:41:14,300
Why does it bother you so much
to see men cooking and

640
00:41:14,367 --> 00:41:18,667
performing tasks generallyrelegated
to women? They seem happy enough.

641
00:41:18,733 --> 00:41:21,667
You act as if your own masculinity
were threatened because another man

642
00:41:21,733 --> 00:41:24,367
performs a supposedly
feminine task.

643
00:41:24,433 --> 00:41:27,200
Why can't you just be yourself
and let them be who they are?

644
00:41:27,267 --> 00:41:29,567
Because... Sorry, pal.

645
00:41:29,633 --> 00:41:34,500
Because no man can be truly happy acting
as a house maid to a bunch of man-eaters.

646
00:41:34,567 --> 00:41:37,567
Cooking and sewing just aren't
in the male hormones.

647
00:41:37,633 --> 00:41:40,533
These poor, desperate wretches don't know
any better because they don't have any

648
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,067
role models,
like John Wayne or Stallone.

649
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:45,100
-If they did...
-They'd be violent,

650
00:41:45,167 --> 00:41:49,533
emotionally repressed,
and narrow-minded.

651
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,833
Just like my heroes.
Strong and masculine and virile.

652
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:58,333
Hey, buddy, you got anyof that kiwi
tart left? And can I get a chair?

653
00:42:01,433 --> 00:42:07,600
Oh, my! It's beautiful!
Oh, you made it yourselves?

654
00:42:07,667 --> 00:42:14,500
It's wonderful but, really, I... My apartment
is so small, I... Really, I couldn't.

655
00:42:14,567 --> 00:42:16,600
Nice, though. Very nice.

656
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:19,367
I have a lot of fantasies about
being tied up and spanked.

657
00:42:19,433 --> 00:42:21,500
I suppose it isn't very
liberated, is it?

658
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:23,700
What kind of fantasies
do feminists have?

659
00:42:23,767 --> 00:42:28,067
Bunny, please go to sleep! We have to get
up early and look for the Piranha Women.

660
00:42:28,133 --> 00:42:32,500
What kind of fantasies do Piranha
Women have? Eating men, I suppose.

661
00:42:32,567 --> 00:42:34,167
Charbroiled or baked?

662
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:43,767
Donnahew, Alan Alda.

663
00:42:43,833 --> 00:42:45,800
Oh, great. I could use a drink.

664
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,600
What is this? Hot chocolate?

665
00:42:54,333 --> 00:42:57,133
Men don't bring other men
hot chocolate!

666
00:42:59,167 --> 00:43:04,300
Guys, this is no way to live.

00:43:04,367 --> 00:43:07,633
What's killing me, is I know that,
deep inside, every lastone of you beats

668
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:12,300
the heart of a virile,
macho, manly man.

669
00:43:12,367 --> 00:43:16,100
And I'll be damned if I sitidly by
and watch you allwaste away your lives

670
00:43:16,167 --> 00:43:18,933
as a bunch of sniveling,
cowardly wimps.

671
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,233
Tonight I'm going to teach
you all how to be men.

672
00:43:25,167 --> 00:43:26,733
And I know just how to do it.

673
00:43:30,633 --> 00:43:31,967
Beer!

674
00:43:33,567 --> 00:43:37,167
There! See what it is to be a man!

675
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:51,733
Huh? Take it! Do it! Come on,
I know you want it! Be a man!

676
00:43:52,333 --> 00:43:54,967
Do it! Beer!

677
00:43:55,067 --> 00:43:57,867
Come on, you're the chief.
Show 'em what you got.

678
00:44:45,333 --> 00:44:48,633
Come on, boys, pass 'em out!
Beer!

679
00:44:50,867 --> 00:44:55,067
Beer! Beer! Beer! Beer!

680
00:44:55,133 --> 00:44:57,800
-Beer!
-Beer!

681
00:44:57,867 --> 00:45:00,067
-Beer!
-Beer!

682
00:45:00,133 --> 00:45:04,067
ALL TOGETHER: Beer! Beer!
Beer! Beer! Beer! Beer!

683
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:14,133
Come on, guys, keep drinking. There's
plenty more where that came from.

684
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:18,333
All right. Now, we're going to have
a little pop quiz here on what we learned.

685
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,200
So, pay attention. Eyes front.

686
00:45:21,267 --> 00:45:23,767
Now, what's that?

687
00:45:24,833 --> 00:45:27,800
-ALL TOGETHER: Beer.
-Yeah, all right, good.

688
00:45:27,867 --> 00:45:31,133
Here we go. What's that?

689
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:36,333
-ALL TOGETHER: Penthouse!
-Yeah, okay. What's that?

690
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,433
ALL TOGETHER: Key chain.

691
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,100
Right on. Good men.

692
00:45:41,167 --> 00:45:45,867
All right. Now, let's take
a little scenario, here.

693
00:45:48,233 --> 00:45:53,067
Let's say you're riding down
the street in your Corvette,

694
00:45:53,067 --> 00:45:57,967
you got one hand on the wheel, palming it,
you got one eye out looking for the cops.

695
00:45:58,067 --> 00:46:02,700
You spot out of the corner of your eye,
walking down the street in some sexy hot pants,

696
00:46:02,767 --> 00:46:04,500
some buxom teen talent.

697
00:46:06,233 --> 00:46:10,967
You know, a dame.
A girl, a broad, a wench.

698
00:46:11,067 --> 00:46:14,700
A woman! So, what do you do?

699
00:46:14,767 --> 00:46:18,900
No, no get back! You don't run
and hide!Get back there!

700
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:23,467
You know, what do you do?

701
00:46:23,533 --> 00:46:28,067
No, no, you don't offer them
knitted products! Men don't knit!

702
00:46:29,533 --> 00:46:34,200
You yell out to her!
You yell out, "Hey, sexy mama!

703
00:46:34,267 --> 00:46:38,933
"Hey, love machine! You want to
go for a ride in my 'vette?"

704
00:46:39,067 --> 00:46:44,800
So, let's try it, all right?
Okay? Hey, sexy mama!

705
00:46:44,867 --> 00:46:48,167
ALL TOGETHER: Hey, sexy mama!

706
00:46:49,067 --> 00:46:51,933
Hey, love machine!

707
00:46:52,067 --> 00:46:54,467
ALL TOGETHER: Hey, love machine!

708
00:46:54,533 --> 00:46:58,200
That's it. You want to go
for a ride in my 'vette?

709
00:46:58,267 --> 00:47:01,600
ALL TOGETHER: You want to go
for a ride in my 'vette?

710
00:47:01,667 --> 00:47:05,967
Yeah! That was pretty good. All right.
Go ahead, boys,you earned another swig.

711
00:47:10,733 --> 00:47:11,800
Ah...

712
00:47:11,867 --> 00:47:13,200
Yeah.

713
00:47:17,433 --> 00:47:21,233
Hey, fellas, take five.

714
00:47:22,133 --> 00:47:23,300
(CRASHING)

715
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:30,067
Excuse me, hi. I heard all
the noise, and I couldn't sleep,

716
00:47:30,133 --> 00:47:32,867
so I thought maybe you wanted me
to make you some hot chocolate.

717
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:34,933
-Chick.
-Broad.

718
00:47:35,067 --> 00:47:38,333
-Sexy mama!
-What?

719
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:43,600
Hey, baby! You want to go
for a ride in my 'vette?

720
00:47:43,667 --> 00:47:45,600
I don't know, where's it parked?

721
00:47:47,367 --> 00:47:51,833
Hey, love machine, let's do it dirty.

722
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:55,633
Love machine? What happened to tuna
fish casseroles and needle point?

723
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:58,900
I mean, all I came out here
was to ask for somehot chocolate...

724
00:47:58,967 --> 00:48:03,100
Dr. Hunt! No! Dr. Hunt!

725
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:09,600
-Let go of Bunny.
-No!

726
00:48:14,067 --> 00:48:15,733
What are you doing out here?

727
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:27,233
Look, I'm sorry, all right?
I'm sorry. I mean it, I'm sorry.

728
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:31,267
It's just that we had a party and
the boys got a little out of control.

729
00:48:31,333 --> 00:48:35,600
Out of control?
They tried to gang rape Bunny.

730
00:48:35,667 --> 00:48:38,067
And I didn't get any
hot chocolate.

731
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:41,467
Gang rape her, huh? Boy,
I didn't know they had it in them.

732
00:48:42,267 --> 00:48:43,567
Jerk.

733
00:48:43,633 --> 00:48:45,900
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it
that way. I meant...

734
00:48:45,967 --> 00:48:48,267
Bunny, you know what
I meant, right?

735
00:48:48,333 --> 00:48:49,833
I guess so.

736
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:53,433
It's just that, considering how
faggy they were acting, it's just

737
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:58,067
kind of delightful to see them finally
taking a healthy interest in the opposite sex.

738
00:48:58,067 --> 00:49:01,833
God! A healthy interest to
you means a violent one.

739
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:05,500
Oh, yeah, like your little Piranha
Women don't resortto violence.

740
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:07,667
They only kill,
slice up and eat men.

741
00:49:07,733 --> 00:49:10,933
Quite right, and I'm beginning to
think they've got the right idea.

742
00:49:16,933 --> 00:49:18,567
*

743
00:49:36,067 --> 00:49:40,333
Oh, fudge a duck!
The propeller's stuck again.

744
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,267
There's too much grass in this area.

745
00:49:42,333 --> 00:49:45,233
Look, we're just going to have to drag
it downstream where there's deeper water.

746
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:47,533
Drag it?

747
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:50,300
Yeah, drag it.
You got us into this mess.

748
00:49:50,367 --> 00:49:53,533
Oh! You mean we have
to get in the water!

749
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,667
I didn't even bring any trunks.

750
00:50:00,367 --> 00:50:01,767
-Hey.
-Yeah.

751
00:50:10,867 --> 00:50:13,600
-Ew! Ew!
-What, what, leeches?

752
00:50:13,667 --> 00:50:17,733
-No, catfish.
-Catfish? Catfish don't bite.

753
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,900
I know, but they swish all around
my ankles, and it feels icky.

754
00:50:20,967 --> 00:50:23,833
I always hated catfish,
even as a kid.

755
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:26,867
There's no ickier feeling than
catfish swishing around.

756
00:50:26,933 --> 00:50:28,933
I mean, what if one crawled up
my pants like...

757
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,400
Oh, shut up with the catfish! If you want to
get back in the boat, get back in the boat.

758
00:50:32,467 --> 00:50:36,267
Margo, me thinks thou
doth protest too much.

759
00:50:37,233 --> 00:50:39,767
What's that supposed to mean?

760
00:50:39,833 --> 00:50:42,367
You're always mad at me,
you're always yelling at me.

761
00:50:42,433 --> 00:50:45,800
I'm sure a big doctor like you knows that,
underneath that meanness, you're just hiding

762
00:50:45,867 --> 00:50:47,167
your true feelings.

763
00:50:47,967 --> 00:50:49,133
Ha! Which is?

764
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,967
That you really love me.

765
00:50:51,033 --> 00:50:53,433
I don't love you,
I don't even like you!

766
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:56,533
Humph! Then why is your voice
quivering as you say that?

767
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:59,000
My voice is not quivering.

768
00:50:59,067 --> 00:51:03,667
Yes, it is. It is. You can always
tell when a woman's in love

769
00:51:03,733 --> 00:51:06,300
because her voice quivers
when she speaks.

770
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:09,200
My voice is not quivering!

771
00:51:09,267 --> 00:51:10,400
Why are you getting so emotional?

772
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:12,633
-I'm not emotional.
-It's quivering again.

773
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:15,367
I'm not emotional or quivering.

774
00:51:15,433 --> 00:51:19,167
Margo, are you getting your period?

775
00:51:19,233 --> 00:51:24,300
No, I'm not getting my period. It's not
due for two weeks. Why am I telling you this?

776
00:51:24,367 --> 00:51:26,600
Because I care, dammit!

777
00:51:26,667 --> 00:51:27,967
Jim, there's a leech on your neck.

778
00:51:28,067 --> 00:51:31,200
Ugh! Ew! Ew! Leech!

779
00:51:31,267 --> 00:51:33,133
BUNNY: Hey, are you guys
having a water fight?

780
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,067
No, we're not having
a water fight.

781
00:51:42,367 --> 00:51:44,400
JIM: That's when I decided
to start my own business.

782
00:51:44,467 --> 00:51:47,700
Everybody said I was crazy,
but taking orders from others,

783
00:51:47,767 --> 00:51:49,933
that's just not the way
the Jim man is made.

784
00:51:50,067 --> 00:51:53,200
Hey, Margo, have some of this. It's great.
It's a great dip. It's guacamole.

785
00:51:53,267 --> 00:51:58,767
Of course, it's guacamole! I'm sick
of guacamole! I'm sick of avocadoes!

786
00:52:00,067 --> 00:52:01,100
I want meat.

787
00:52:01,167 --> 00:52:04,900
Ha! I told you you'd want
a Burger King out here.

788
00:52:04,967 --> 00:52:09,233
Or maybe a nice juicy steak,
or some meat loaf, or...

789
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,333
Quit looking at me like that.

790
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:15,100
Hey!

791
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,833
You want to eat me, don't you?

792
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,467
I didn't say that.

793
00:52:20,533 --> 00:52:23,300
You were thinking it. I can see that
look in your eye. You want to eat me!

794
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:25,833
Only for a minute.

795
00:52:27,367 --> 00:52:31,067
Moderate feminist!
You women's libbers are all alike.

796
00:52:31,067 --> 00:52:34,333
A couple of days out here in the
jungle, and you turn into savages!

797
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,667
You throw away all that
rhetoric about equality,

798
00:52:36,733 --> 00:52:40,167
and you get down to what you really want.
The domination and consumption of men.

799
00:52:40,233 --> 00:52:44,867
I'm sorry!
I'm hot, and I'm tired,

800
00:52:44,933 --> 00:52:48,933
and I lost my head for a moment!

801
00:52:49,067 --> 00:52:53,133
Or maybe you found your true
self. Take a look at her, Bunny.

802
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:57,700
Take a good, hard look.
She wants to eat me.

803
00:52:57,767 --> 00:53:01,067
See for yourself what the women's
movement is really all about.

804
00:53:02,933 --> 00:53:06,833
That's it! You're dead meat!

805
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:11,433
No, no. Honey! Help. Hey,
honey, chill. Chill, really.

806
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,700
Come on. Why don't you have
some choice Donnahew meat, huh?

807
00:53:13,767 --> 00:53:15,767
I'm sure they'd be pleased
to be eaten by you.

808
00:53:15,833 --> 00:53:19,900
Chauvinistic pig! Let's see what
you look like with some real...

809
00:53:19,967 --> 00:53:21,700
Don't eat him, Dr. Hunt!

810
00:53:24,533 --> 00:53:28,767
Oh, my... I'm losing my mind.

811
00:53:28,833 --> 00:53:32,833
It's this jungle.
I'm just losing my mind.

812
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:34,900
Well, with having your period
and everything...

813
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:40,767
We've got to go back.
We're going back.

814
00:53:40,833 --> 00:53:46,167
We've just gone too deep into the
heart of the jungle. We're going back.

815
00:53:46,233 --> 00:53:48,067
It's a little too late for that, Margo.

816
00:53:49,167 --> 00:53:50,400
I think they found us.

817
00:53:51,067 --> 00:53:52,567
BUNNY: Cute outfits!

818
00:53:52,633 --> 00:53:55,567
JIM: Maybe, but they don't
look too friendly to me.

819
00:53:55,633 --> 00:53:57,233
DR. HUNT: Don't worry.

820
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,133
What have you got?
Grenade? Gun?

821
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:02,067
No, something all feminist
cultures will understand

822
00:54:02,067 --> 00:54:06,933
no matter how radical or how primitive.
My N.O.W. membership card.

823
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,567
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

824
00:54:11,633 --> 00:54:13,967
-What did she say?
-I'm not sure.

825
00:54:14,067 --> 00:54:17,333
It's a strange, difficult language.

826
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:23,467
Listen, I am looking for Dr. Kurtz.
Do you understand me? Dr. Kurtz.

827
00:54:23,533 --> 00:54:24,700
Kurtz?

828
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:27,133
Yes, Dr. Kurtz.
Can you take me to her?

829
00:54:28,567 --> 00:54:29,833
Get your stuff.

830
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,533
The secret temple of the Piranha Women.

831
00:54:42,767 --> 00:54:46,167
Their architecture
issurprisingly advanced.

832
00:54:46,233 --> 00:54:48,067
It looks like a big Lego to me.

833
00:55:01,767 --> 00:55:03,667
This must be the altar roomwhere they...

834
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:05,067
Eat guys?

835
00:55:05,067 --> 00:55:06,200
Yeah.

836
00:55:13,067 --> 00:55:18,200
Hey, look. A vegetable juice spa.
This must be great for the complexion.

837
00:55:18,267 --> 00:55:20,100
-Jim, don't.
-What?

838
00:55:20,167 --> 00:55:22,367
Bunny, hand me one of those Fritos.

839
00:55:26,433 --> 00:55:28,433
(BUBBLING)

840
00:55:30,167 --> 00:55:33,900
-What is it?
-A piranha. The real thing.

841
00:55:33,967 --> 00:55:36,500
This must be where the Piranha
Women dispose of the fat and bones

842
00:55:36,567 --> 00:55:38,067
of their male sacrifices.

843
00:55:38,067 --> 00:55:41,067
DR. KURTZ: Very good, Dr. Hunt.
That's quite correct.

844
00:55:41,067 --> 00:55:43,767
Francine Kurtz. Then you are alive.

845
00:55:43,833 --> 00:55:45,700
And she's got one of those
cute outfits on.

846
00:55:45,767 --> 00:55:48,833
I have more than just the outfit, Bunny.

847
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:52,367
The Piranha Women have christened
me Empress of The Avocado Jungle.

848
00:55:52,433 --> 00:55:54,367
I am their supreme ruler.

849
00:55:54,433 --> 00:55:56,067
Empress?

850
00:55:56,133 --> 00:55:59,167
I knew the Avocado Board
would send someone after me,

851
00:55:59,233 --> 00:56:02,100
but I never suspected it
would be another feminist.

852
00:56:02,167 --> 00:56:04,067
After I did away with the army...

853
00:56:04,067 --> 00:56:06,700
You mean to say you led those
Piranha women against the soldiers?

854
00:56:06,767 --> 00:56:11,433
Of course. They violated our
jungle sanctuary. They had to die.

855
00:56:12,367 --> 00:56:14,433
They were pretty delicious, too.

856
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:18,400
Dr. Kurtz, I am unfamiliar with
the academic guidelines at Radcliffe,

857
00:56:18,467 --> 00:56:21,533
but I would think any major university
would consider warring on the United States

858
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:24,400
and eating prisoners of war
a serious breach of ethics.

859
00:56:24,467 --> 00:56:27,533
Always the cautious scholar,
huh, Dr. Hunt?

860
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:31,533
I'm not here to study the
Piranha Women. I'm here to lead them.

861
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:34,867
The future of feminism lie
sin this temple.

862
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:37,333
You're saying the future of
women is in cannibalism?

863
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:42,200
Face up to the truth! This is a war!
A war between men and women.

864
00:56:42,267 --> 00:56:45,133
Anything short of cannibalism
is just beating around the bush.

865
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:48,067
Well, it's obvious the Avocado
Board sent the wrong scholar

866
00:56:48,067 --> 00:56:49,967
to deal with the Piranha Women.

867
00:56:50,067 --> 00:56:52,367
And you're so obviously
the right one.

868
00:56:52,433 --> 00:56:56,333
An academic so naive, so trusting,

869
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,600
she actually believes
there's an avocado shortage.

870
00:56:59,667 --> 00:57:02,667
Yes. That's what they told me, too.

871
00:57:02,733 --> 00:57:06,733
But I was suspicious enough to do
a little researchinto the matter.

872
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:10,800
The fact of the matter is, the
United States hasa massive avocado glut.

873
00:57:10,867 --> 00:57:13,400
They're dumping avocados by
the ton into Santa Monica Harbor

874
00:57:13,467 --> 00:57:14,800
just to get rid of them.

875
00:57:14,867 --> 00:57:16,967
But if that's the case,
then why send me?

876
00:57:17,067 --> 00:57:19,900
You're an ethnohistorian.
Use your head.

877
00:57:19,967 --> 00:57:25,067
It's not the avocados the government is
worried about, it's the Piranha Women.

878
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:28,133
The reactionary male factions
are terrified of them.

879
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:31,367
Terrified of the example a nation
of strong women might set

880
00:57:31,433 --> 00:57:32,733
for the rest of the country.

881
00:57:34,067 --> 00:57:36,733
After they succeeded in
stopping the ERA,

882
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:39,800
in the wake of a mainstream
feminist backlash,

883
00:57:39,867 --> 00:57:43,300
they figured it was the perfect time
to wipe out the Piranha Women for good.

884
00:57:44,633 --> 00:57:46,633
But the reservations in Malibu?

885
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:50,600
They're there all right.
I did some research into those, too.

886
00:57:50,667 --> 00:57:52,867
Deluxe condominiums.

887
00:57:52,933 --> 00:57:57,667
Pool, sauna, total luxury living.

888
00:57:57,733 --> 00:58:02,500
Only what they didn't tell you about, were
the thousands of subscriptions to Cosmopolitan

889
00:58:02,567 --> 00:58:05,900
that were timed for delivery when
the Piranha Women took up residence.

890
00:58:05,967 --> 00:58:09,100
Not to mention the team of Mary Kay
cosmetics saleswomen who were ready

891
00:58:09,167 --> 00:58:11,067
to pounce upon them.

892
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:14,833
They had a secret plan for doing
away with the Piranha Women.

893
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:18,400
Something far more sinister
than armored divisionof infantry.

894
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:20,933
Cultural assimilation.

895
00:58:21,067 --> 00:58:22,933
Yes.

896
00:58:23,067 --> 00:58:26,967
Within five years, the Piranha Women would
have been just a bunch of bikini bunnies

897
00:58:27,067 --> 00:58:30,167
bouncing around Malibu,
looking for a good sushi bar.

898
00:58:30,233 --> 00:58:33,433
I know a great sushi bar in Malibu.
You go down Sunset, turn right at PCH and...

899
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:38,533
You see? They would have
all ended up... like her.

900
00:58:41,733 --> 00:58:45,800
Now that you're here, you have
only one choice. To join with us.

901
00:58:45,867 --> 00:58:48,200
Become a Piranha Woman.

902
00:58:48,267 --> 00:58:50,300
I can't do that.

903
00:58:50,367 --> 00:58:52,067
Although I'm discouraged,

904
00:58:52,067 --> 00:58:55,367
I can't give up hope that there
will be equality between the sexes.

905
00:58:55,433 --> 00:58:59,233
I cannot allow you to leave the jungle
and reveal the secrets of the Piranha Women.

906
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:03,467
You either join us,
or you all die together.

907
00:59:03,533 --> 00:59:08,433
Then kill us. Because I'd rather die
than compromise my ethical standards.

908
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:13,133
Hey! Speak for yourself. I'm sure we could
round-table this whole thing and come up...

909
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,067
(SNAPPING FINGERS)

910
00:59:15,067 --> 00:59:17,533
You, idiot male, will die anyway.

911
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:21,300
You look a little tough, but I suppose
if you were marinated before cooking...

912
00:59:21,367 --> 00:59:23,400
Take him.

913
00:59:23,467 --> 00:59:26,067
Marinated? Sweetie, that's carcinogenic.
You don't want to... Bunny!

914
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:27,100
Jim!

915
00:59:27,733 --> 00:59:28,733
Help me!

916
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,567
Take Dr. Hunt also.

917
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:44,733
You're outnumbered, Margo. There are
a thousand Piranha Women in this temple.

918
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:46,233
You haven't got a chance.

919
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:48,967
You let my friends go,
or I'll shoot you first.

920
00:59:49,067 --> 00:59:52,800
Go ahead.
Fire on a fellow feminist.

921
00:59:52,867 --> 00:59:55,800
Fire on a fellow anthropologist.

922
00:59:55,867 --> 00:59:59,067
You may not personally agree with my
tactics, but you know my only goal

923
00:59:59,133 --> 01:00:01,933
is to help the Piranha Women
maintain their cultural heritage.

924
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,833
Go ahead and shoot.

925
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:09,000
Shoot her! Do it! Give the
woman what she wants!

926
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,533
It will take some time to make the
preparations for your initiation into the tribe

927
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:22,300
of Piranha Women. I will give you until
tomorrow morning to make your decision.

928
01:00:22,367 --> 01:00:27,133
If you agree to join us,
you will sacrifice your first man.

929
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:31,667
If you do not agree, you will be thrown
into the piranha pit, and you will die.

930
01:00:31,733 --> 01:00:32,933
Painfully.

931
01:00:34,233 --> 01:00:35,333
Take her.

932
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,233
Take the airhead, too.

933
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:40,700
Jim!

934
01:00:40,767 --> 01:00:42,833
Bunny, don't worry.
You'll save me!

935
01:00:47,067 --> 01:00:51,667
Hi. Hey, I hope you know that crack
about shooting you was just a joke.

936
01:00:51,733 --> 01:00:55,533
That's me, always with a...
Nonstop, the whole trip. I'm...

937
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:58,333
Have they told you how great you
look in that dress, because that's...

938
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:02,433
See, it's feminine, and
feminist, which is my cause.

939
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:06,767
Really, feminism. I thought Geraldine
Ferraro, for example, creamed Bush

940
01:01:06,833 --> 01:01:07,867
in that debate. She...

941
01:01:07,933 --> 01:01:10,367
You're gonna cook up real good.

942
01:01:10,433 --> 01:01:14,700
Put him with the rest of the men.
Tomorrow, we eat him.

943
01:01:14,767 --> 01:01:16,867
You know, I've got
a subscription to Ms.

944
01:01:19,633 --> 01:01:22,100
I'm gonna be in with
your lunch meat, huh?

945
01:01:22,167 --> 01:01:24,467
Those guys must be bigger wimps
than the Donnahews.

946
01:01:25,933 --> 01:01:27,867
All right, I'm going,
I'm go... Oh!

947
01:01:27,933 --> 01:01:29,733
Can I interject one thing?

948
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:32,667
Now, I'm not saying this
just to save my hide,

949
01:01:32,733 --> 01:01:35,300
but talking strictly
nutritional requirements,

950
01:01:35,367 --> 01:01:39,067
if you girls are eating only men, you cannot
possibly be getting everything you need

951
01:01:39,067 --> 01:01:40,800
from the four basic food groups.

952
01:01:40,867 --> 01:01:42,167
(THUDDING)

953
01:01:45,967 --> 01:01:51,967
Gee! You guys are pretty big
for wimps! Of course,

954
01:01:52,067 --> 01:01:53,933
the joke's on you when those
broads come back and start

955
01:01:54,067 --> 01:01:56,533
picking out ingredients
for chicken McMacho.

956
01:01:59,733 --> 01:02:01,133
Anybody got a smoke?

957
01:02:06,767 --> 01:02:08,733
I brought you some food.

958
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:10,833
Who are you?

959
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:15,133
I'm Jean-Pierre,
your sacrifice for tomorrow.

960
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:18,100
It is traditional in the
tribe of the Piranha Women

961
01:02:18,167 --> 01:02:22,800
for the sacrificee to serve his
mistress the night before the ceremony.

962
01:02:23,633 --> 01:02:25,133
And you speak English?

963
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,400
Some.

964
01:02:26,467 --> 01:02:29,867
I learned it from listening
to Dr. Kurtz.

965
01:02:29,933 --> 01:02:32,267
Well, you must be very smart
to have picked it up so quickly

966
01:02:32,333 --> 01:02:34,133
without any formal training.

967
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:39,200
Alas, intelligence in males is
not valued bythe Piranha Women.

968
01:02:39,267 --> 01:02:41,967
Only muscle tissue.

969
01:02:42,067 --> 01:02:44,967
Well, you certainly have
plenty of that.

970
01:02:45,067 --> 01:02:48,500
They force us to work out with weights.
It makes the meat more flavorful.

971
01:02:48,567 --> 01:02:49,933
Please, eat.

972
01:02:50,067 --> 01:02:51,633
Oh, thank you. I am hungry.

973
01:02:57,900 --> 01:02:59,367
Mm! Very good.

974
01:02:59,433 --> 01:03:03,133
I'm glad. He was a friend
of mine. Jacques.

975
01:03:03,967 --> 01:03:05,633
This stuff is really good.

976
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:09,500
Chew but tasty. Kind of like
lean pork. What is it?

977
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:10,567
Jacques.

978
01:03:10,633 --> 01:03:14,100
Is that one of those
beef substitutes? Huh?

979
01:03:14,167 --> 01:03:18,267
Whatever it is, it sure is good.
You work out on a Nautilus?

980
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:20,900
Got any more dip?

981
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:54,067
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

982
01:04:06,933 --> 01:04:08,733
I'd like to speak
to Jean-Pierre.

983
01:04:09,933 --> 01:04:11,300
Where is Jean-Pierre?

984
01:04:14,867 --> 01:04:17,233
Oh, he's a friendof yours, huh?

985
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:21,067
Well, don't worry, I won't kill him.
God knows I won't eat him.

986
01:04:41,333 --> 01:04:45,867
There's your sacrifice. If you wish to
become a Piranha Woman, you must first take

987
01:04:45,933 --> 01:04:50,333
his body, and then his life.
What is your decision?

988
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:54,067
I refuse to kill another human
being in cold blood.

989
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:57,400
However, in deference to
your cultural traditions,

990
01:04:57,467 --> 01:04:59,367
I would be willing to have
sex with him.

991
01:04:59,433 --> 01:05:02,633
Forget it. If you want your cake,
you'll have to eat it.

992
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:05,433
If you do not use this dagger to
draw his blood, I will have you thrown

993
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:06,867
into the piranha pit.

994
01:05:06,933 --> 01:05:10,533
I won't join your tribe, and
I appeal to you as a member of

995
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,500
the National Academy of Sciences,

996
01:05:12,567 --> 01:05:15,067
to release me and my friends
and allow us to go on our way.

997
01:05:15,133 --> 01:05:18,200
No! I want to be a Piranha Woman.

998
01:05:18,267 --> 01:05:19,900
Bunny, what are you saying?

999
01:05:19,967 --> 01:05:21,500
I want to be a Piranha Woman.

1000
01:05:21,567 --> 01:05:23,500
Bunny, dammit, I knew
I shouldn't have brought you.

1001
01:05:23,567 --> 01:05:25,867
You haven't had enough women's
studies core classes.

1002
01:05:25,933 --> 01:05:29,133
You're being seduced by the simplicity
of the Piranha Women's philosophy.

1003
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:32,433
No I haven't! I just want one
of those cute outfits.

1004
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:34,067
Bunny, listen to me.

1005
01:05:34,133 --> 01:05:35,267
Silence her.

1006
01:05:37,867 --> 01:05:40,133
Are you sure you want to
become a Piranha Woman?

1007
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:42,067
Yes.

1008
01:05:42,067 --> 01:05:45,133
Are you willing to partake in
the blood sacrifice initiation?

1009
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,667
Well, if you mean to have sex with
a guy and then kill him, sure.

1010
01:05:47,733 --> 01:05:50,833
I'll try it. I've done weirder
things at frat parties.

1011
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:53,367
Then I will allow you to
become a Piranha Woman,

1012
01:05:54,333 --> 01:05:55,833
on one condition.

1013
01:05:59,133 --> 01:06:01,200
He shall be your sacrifice.

1014
01:06:02,567 --> 01:06:06,267
Well, now you've gone too far,
Dr. Kurtz.

1015
01:06:06,333 --> 01:06:11,633
I happen to be a pretty good judge of human
nature, and as far as our Bunny goes, well,

1016
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:14,700
the poor kid happens to be nuts
about me. She would never...

1017
01:06:14,767 --> 01:06:15,900
BUNNY: Sure, I'll kill him.

1018
01:06:15,967 --> 01:06:18,333
Prepare them both for sacrifice.

1019
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:19,400
Tootles.

1020
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:25,600
-What?
-Just do it.

1021
01:06:26,267 --> 01:06:28,067
(YELLING)

1022
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:30,567
The sacrifice has escaped!
Kill him!

1023
01:06:32,233 --> 01:06:33,567
Quick, this way.

1024
01:06:33,633 --> 01:06:35,600
Stop them! Kill them!

1025
01:06:40,833 --> 01:06:43,267
Jump! I can fight them
off from here.

1026
01:06:43,333 --> 01:06:44,833
Oh, no. You're coming with me.

1027
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:46,833
No, it's more important that you escape.

1028
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:51,067
Jean-Pierre, will you stop being
a sacrifice? Now, come with me.

1029
01:07:01,067 --> 01:07:04,433
Jean-Pierre! Jean-Pierre!

1030
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:08,067
Jean-Pierre. Dammit,
the first decent guy I...

1031
01:07:08,133 --> 01:07:09,900
(ARROWS WHIZZING)

1032
01:07:59,433 --> 01:08:03,500
So, this is why Piranha Women
have red hair, huh? Huh?

1033
01:08:03,567 --> 01:08:06,533
Hm. Gee, I hope this dye isn't
going to make my hair frizz.

1034
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:08,633
Do you have any conditioner for that?

1035
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:11,567
You know, actually, I was thinking maybe
we could go a little shorter this time

1036
01:08:11,633 --> 01:08:14,833
in the cut if that's okay with you.
Or maybe, if we keep it red, I should just

1037
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:18,067
keep it long, because then I'll look like
Tiffany, and actually I was thinking about

1038
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:19,400
taking up singing, so...

1039
01:08:30,567 --> 01:08:35,467
Hey, have I told you girls how
terrific you look? Great loins.

1040
01:08:35,533 --> 01:08:39,133
Hey, what are you doing? Hey, wait,
whoa, whoa! Can I say one thing?

1041
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:42,400
One thing. I'd rather have you
kill me than make me a gelding.

1042
01:08:42,467 --> 01:08:47,367
We had a dog once that we fixed,
and he was just never happy.

1043
01:08:47,433 --> 01:08:51,633
Hey, can't we be reasonable about this?
I mean, we're all people here, Piranhas,

1044
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:53,900
non-Piranhas.

1045
01:08:53,967 --> 01:08:58,567
Hey! What's this?
A little hot tub action, huh?

1046
01:08:58,633 --> 01:09:03,133
Maybe I misjudged you girls. I think
I might actually like this place.

1047
01:09:04,267 --> 01:09:05,667
Oh, yeah!

1048
01:09:06,567 --> 01:09:08,967
That's nice.

1049
01:09:09,067 --> 01:09:12,167
Hey, you know, you're not such
bad young ladies after all.

1050
01:09:12,233 --> 01:09:14,433
Probably just had a rough childhood, right?

1051
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:18,733
Smoked a lot of pot in high school,
parents were divorced, that kind of thing?

1052
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:22,733
Oh, yeah. Oh, that's good.
A little lower. A little lower.

1053
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:25,900
That's the spot. Now make circles.

1054
01:09:25,967 --> 01:09:29,133
(LAUGHING) Just kidding.

1055
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:34,100
I see at least a couple of you girls know
how to treat a man around this crazy temple.

1056
01:09:34,167 --> 01:09:38,533
You know, a lot of you Piranha gals,
you probably just never met the right guy.

1057
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:44,100
And I bet you you're terrific cooks.
Something around heresmells fabulous!

1058
01:09:44,167 --> 01:09:48,700
I think it's this bath water. This would
make a hearty soup base, wouldn't it?

1059
01:09:51,733 --> 01:09:54,733
Hey! What's up, Doc?

1060
01:09:55,367 --> 01:09:56,367
What goes...

1061
01:09:57,233 --> 01:09:58,667
Hey! What...

1062
01:09:58,733 --> 01:10:03,433
Oh, my God, you're marinating me!
Hey! Let me out!

1063
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:16,033
We are the Barracuda Women. We are
the sworn enemies ofthe Piranha Women.

1064
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:19,967
If you are escaping from them,
you must be our friend.

1065
01:10:26,133 --> 01:10:30,733
Thousands of years ago, the Piranha Women
and the Barracuda women were as one.

1066
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:34,300
But we split over ideological differences.

1067
01:10:34,367 --> 01:10:36,400
What were they?

1068
01:10:36,467 --> 01:10:41,933
The Piranha Women believe that men should
be slaughtered and eaten with guacamole dip.

1069
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,633
And you think that's wrong?

1070
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:44,867
Yes!

1071
01:10:44,933 --> 01:10:48,400
We believe they should be
eaten with clam dip.

1072
01:10:48,467 --> 01:10:51,100
That's it? Clam dip?

1073
01:10:51,167 --> 01:10:52,967
It's a fundamental principle.

1074
01:10:53,033 --> 01:10:56,600
You people have been divided for thousands
of years because of a kind of dip?

1075
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:59,633
Oh, that really makes me mad!

1076
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:02,700
Why is it women always argue
over such petty differences?

1077
01:11:02,767 --> 01:11:04,733
It's no wonder we couldn't
get the ERA passed.

1078
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:07,600
Men can always seem to
agree on football and beer.

1079
01:11:08,833 --> 01:11:11,167
Well, that's it!

1080
01:11:11,233 --> 01:11:13,800
We are going back to
the Piranha Women's temple.

1081
01:11:13,867 --> 01:11:16,267
The women of this jungle must unite.

1082
01:11:16,333 --> 01:11:19,733
And I'm going to settle a score with
a certain renegade ethnographer.

1083
01:11:33,267 --> 01:11:35,533
I think I'm going to like
being a Piranha Woman.

1084
01:11:40,067 --> 01:11:44,200
What you do, is you set up a joint
committee consisting of equal numbers of

1085
01:11:44,267 --> 01:11:47,367
Piranha Women and Barracuda Women,
you meet biweekly,

1086
01:11:47,433 --> 01:11:51,567
air any differences that might
arise, and it's really that simple.

1087
01:11:51,633 --> 01:11:53,633
So, what we'll do,
is we'll organize a...

1088
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:39,400
Onward, women!

1089
01:12:42,967 --> 01:12:44,567
(SPEAKING A FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

1090
01:12:48,067 --> 01:12:49,067
Come on, move it!

1091
01:12:58,067 --> 01:12:59,533
Kurtz's field notes.

1092
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:16,067
It's an outline for a book!

1093
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:29,067
Okay, let's see. So, she's going
to make love to me, that's good.

1094
01:13:29,067 --> 01:13:33,600
Then she's going to kill me
and eat me. That's bad.

1095
01:13:34,767 --> 01:13:38,233
Why can't I ever have
a completely good day?

1096
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:42,267
Here, Bunny. Drink of the elixir
of the Piranha Women.

1097
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:52,900
Let the sacrifice begin!

1098
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:05,133
Bunny, please! Put away that knife.
You don't know what you're doing.

1099
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:08,700
This whole crazy jungle's
got you all mixed up.

1100
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:12,100
I know what I'm doing.
I want to become a Piranha Woman.

1101
01:14:13,433 --> 01:14:16,067
JIM: Oh, my God. Your eyes!

1102
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:19,867
That strange elixir of the Piranha Women
has changed the color of your eyes!

1103
01:14:19,933 --> 01:14:24,367
No, it hasn't. Green contacts, stupid.
Now, shut up while I sacrifice you.

1104
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:30,733
Sorry I have to kill you.

1105
01:14:31,767 --> 01:14:34,633
I really did think you were
kind of cute.

1106
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:38,467
Bunny, please don't.
Please don't kill me.

1107
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:41,667
I have to.

1108
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:46,233
What did Margo say?

1109
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:50,167
Oh, yeah. The song.
(SINGING)

1110
01:14:53,667 --> 01:14:54,700
The song.

1111
01:14:55,967 --> 01:14:57,333
Bolero...

1112
01:15:02,867 --> 01:15:05,700
Kill him. Now!

1113
01:15:08,767 --> 01:15:09,867
Kill him!

1114
01:15:10,667 --> 01:15:12,933
-I can't.
-Do it!

1115
01:15:16,533 --> 01:15:19,800
I can't. I love him.

1116
01:15:31,467 --> 01:15:33,633
Throw them both in the piranha pit.

1117
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:38,167
I'll be a bit. That water really
is gonna stain this outfit.

1118
01:15:38,233 --> 01:15:39,233
DR. HUNT: Wait!

1119
01:15:40,967 --> 01:15:42,867
What now?

1120
01:15:42,933 --> 01:15:45,300
According to the traditions
of the Piranha Women,

1121
01:15:45,367 --> 01:15:50,833
I challenge the Empress of The Avocado Jungle
to a battle for the right to the throne.

1122
01:15:50,900 --> 01:15:55,800
That is your right, but I warn you,
Margo, you haven't got a chance.

1123
01:15:55,867 --> 01:15:56,867
We'll see.

1124
01:16:07,467 --> 01:16:09,867
You handle yourself fairly well.

1125
01:16:09,933 --> 01:16:12,300
I studied ancient weaponry
at Berkeley.

1126
01:16:12,367 --> 01:16:13,700
Professor Harris?

1127
01:16:13,767 --> 01:16:15,433
No, Professor Johnson.

1128
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:18,433
Really? I had Professor Johnson
at Stanford.

1129
01:16:19,133 --> 01:16:20,433
Enough preliminaries.

1130
01:16:23,833 --> 01:16:27,633
Why don't you tell the Piranha Women
the real reason you became their leader.

1131
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:29,100
What are you talking about?

1132
01:16:29,167 --> 01:16:31,900
I found your study.

1133
01:16:31,967 --> 01:16:35,367
I read your notes.
The outline for your book?

1134
01:16:35,433 --> 01:16:38,067
You don't care about
the Piranha Women.

1135
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:40,567
You just want to write a
book about your experiences.

1136
01:16:40,633 --> 01:16:43,433
That's not true.

1137
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:47,667
My Life as a Piranha Woman
by Francine Kurtz? Catchy.

1138
01:16:47,733 --> 01:16:49,833
It should make the best-seller list.

1139
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:52,167
They media hype from your
last book was fading.

1140
01:16:52,233 --> 01:16:55,133
You needed something new to
get back on the talk-show circuit.

1141
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:57,067
Isn't that right?

1142
01:16:57,133 --> 01:17:00,867
Well, what better than an expose
on the Piranha Women's lives?

1143
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:03,700
Think Margo will win?

1144
01:17:03,767 --> 01:17:07,067
Yeah. Do you have any of
those red licorice ropes?

1145
01:17:08,167 --> 01:17:10,100
Sure, in my backpack. Why?

1146
01:17:10,167 --> 01:17:12,633
We'll discuss it later.

1147
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:15,800
You were going to exploit their
culture and traditions for a cheap

1148
01:17:15,867 --> 01:17:20,367
paperback potboiler. A kiss,
sacrifice and tell book.

1149
01:17:20,433 --> 01:17:22,667
All right. Anybody want to
get action on Margo?

1150
01:17:22,733 --> 01:17:24,567
The point spread is three
against Dr. Kurtz.

1151
01:17:24,633 --> 01:17:26,867
Huh? Anybody in on this?

1152
01:17:27,767 --> 01:17:29,467
-Sh!
-Chicks...

1153
01:17:29,533 --> 01:17:34,700
It's true. I was planning a book.
But it was going to be a scholarly work.

1154
01:17:34,767 --> 01:17:36,967
Oh, hardly, Kurtz!

1155
01:17:37,067 --> 01:17:40,067
You've spent too much time in the jungle.
You've become a primitive yourself.

1156
01:17:41,567 --> 01:17:45,267
I read your notes. Your field
methodology is sloppy,

1157
01:17:45,333 --> 01:17:49,333
your conclusion's shaky, even Sher Height
couldn't get awaywith the generalizations

1158
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:50,800
you make in your outline.

1159
01:17:55,133 --> 01:17:58,400
You're no better than the
chauvinists who sent us here.

1160
01:17:58,467 --> 01:18:01,833
You'd exploit the Piranha Women
for your own aggrandizement.

1161
01:18:01,900 --> 01:18:03,700
You don't understand. I had...

1162
01:18:10,767 --> 01:18:13,100
-Francine, the pool. Watch it.
-Stay back!

1163
01:18:15,967 --> 01:18:17,467
You don't understand.

1164
01:18:19,067 --> 01:18:22,233
I had to do it.

1165
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:26,600
I'd been on the talk-show circuit
for six months. The token feminist.

1166
01:18:26,667 --> 01:18:30,167
The butt of every bra-burning joke.

1167
01:18:30,233 --> 01:18:32,633
You don't know what it's like trying
to face David Letterman with a book

1168
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:34,433
on male insensitivity.

1169
01:18:37,067 --> 01:18:38,733
I needed something more.

1170
01:18:39,933 --> 01:18:44,600
I thought, "Piranha Women.
Cannibalism."

1171
01:18:46,567 --> 01:18:48,400
Who could laugh at me then?

1172
01:18:48,467 --> 01:18:49,967
-Oh, Francine...
-Stay back!

1173
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:56,700
You're right. I was exploiting
the Piranha Women.

1174
01:18:58,433 --> 01:19:00,200
You don't know what it was like.

1175
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:04,500
David Letterman, the horror!

1176
01:19:05,633 --> 01:19:07,667
The horror of that show!

1177
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:11,467
The horror!

1178
01:19:11,533 --> 01:19:12,733
Francine!

1179
01:19:33,733 --> 01:19:38,667
You're very wise, Dr. Hunt. Now all
the women of the jungle shall be united.

1180
01:19:38,733 --> 01:19:41,733
Well, now that you are united, you may
want to reconsider your relationships

1181
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:43,467
with the men in your tribe.

1182
01:19:43,533 --> 01:19:48,967
There are other ways of relating
to them besidesas foodstuffs.

1183
01:19:49,067 --> 01:19:52,200
We shall consider what
you have said and discuss it

1184
01:19:52,267 --> 01:19:54,067
at our biweekly committee meetings.

1185
01:19:55,633 --> 01:19:59,067
Farewell.
May you make it safely home.

1186
01:20:00,533 --> 01:20:01,867
Bye!

1187
01:20:01,933 --> 01:20:04,033
Yeah, keep in touch.

1188
01:20:05,667 --> 01:20:07,567
Okay, here you go.

1189
01:20:09,533 --> 01:20:10,600
Where's my gun?

1190
01:20:11,633 --> 01:20:14,267
Oh, the gun. Um...

1191
01:20:14,333 --> 01:20:19,100
Hey, let me carry the gun.
Just to the edge of the jungle.

1192
01:20:19,167 --> 01:20:23,067
Come on. I mean, you drove and
everything. Let me carry the gun.

1193
01:20:23,133 --> 01:20:25,967
You know, all the
Piranhachicks are watching...

1194
01:20:26,033 --> 01:20:27,700
I should carry the gun.

1195
01:20:30,533 --> 01:20:31,533
Thanks.

1196
01:20:32,967 --> 01:20:34,733
Hey, it's not loaded, is it?

1197
01:20:37,367 --> 01:20:39,267
(GUNSHOT)

1198
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:46,600
MADDOX: After the medical checkup
with the Valium prescriptions,

1199
01:20:46,667 --> 01:20:49,267
there will be tea with Nancy Reagan.

1200
01:20:49,333 --> 01:20:54,167
Day 2, we will start out with a seminar
by Fawn Hall on office relations.

1201
01:20:54,233 --> 01:20:55,367
I love it!

1202
01:20:55,433 --> 01:20:58,733
Then comes the political orientation.

1203
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:02,633
Yeah, we got Billy Shlafleyon standby.

1204
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:08,067
Hopefully, it won't be long before
Miss Hunt roundsthese girls up.

1205
01:21:08,067 --> 01:21:12,133
Ford, I gotta hand it to you. Using
a feminist to dupe a bunch of feminists.

1206
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:15,433
Well, women aren't that smart.

1207
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:18,767
Women! Hey, how's your wife?

1208
01:21:20,233 --> 01:21:22,233
-It's over.
-Oh.

1209
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:23,533
(GATE SLAMMING)

1210
01:21:25,967 --> 01:21:28,067
Dr. Hunt!

1211
01:21:28,067 --> 01:21:29,533
How long have you been
standing there?

1212
01:21:30,633 --> 01:21:31,733
You didn't hear...

1213
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:33,533
Anything that I didn't already know.

1214
01:21:38,233 --> 01:21:41,267
Francine told me all about
your dirty little plan.

1215
01:21:41,333 --> 01:21:43,900
Kurtz?
Then you found her?

1216
01:21:43,967 --> 01:21:47,600
David Letterman keeps calling,
but we don't know what to tell him.

1217
01:21:47,667 --> 01:21:51,633
I'm afraid Dr. Kurtz won't be doing
any more talk shows. She's dead.

1218
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:53,900
Dead? How?

1219
01:21:56,100 --> 01:22:00,933
She died trying to protect the cultural
heritage of a primitive society.

1220
01:22:03,967 --> 01:22:06,233
MADDOX: Not so fast, professor.

1221
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:07,867
We're not finished with
you yet.

1222
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:11,267
Your university...

1223
01:22:11,333 --> 01:22:14,067
Nothing's going to happen
to my university.

1224
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:16,500
Except that the Defense Department
will provide a

1225
01:22:16,567 --> 01:22:20,433
generous grant to feminist
studies for research on expanding

1226
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:22,900
women's opportunities in the military.

1227
01:22:22,967 --> 01:22:24,567
You are mad!

1228
01:22:24,633 --> 01:22:27,700
Otherwise, I go on the
David Letterman Show myself

1229
01:22:27,767 --> 01:22:30,367
and tell him about the Marines,
and the millions of dollars of equipment

1230
01:22:30,433 --> 01:22:32,667
lost in The Avocado Jungle.

1231
01:22:32,733 --> 01:22:36,067
Not to mention the diversion of funds
to pay for Malibu condos and subscriptions

1232
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:38,067
to Cosmopolitan.

1233
01:22:38,133 --> 01:22:41,833
I can just imagine the sarcastic
look on David's face when he...

1234
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:42,900
You wouldn't.

1235
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:46,267
Don't tempt me.

1236
01:22:52,467 --> 01:22:53,467
Women.

1237
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:07,400
(KNOCKING)

1238
01:23:07,467 --> 01:23:09,767
Dr. Hunt, I've got to talk to you.

1239
01:23:09,833 --> 01:23:11,067
Bunny, what's going on?

1240
01:23:11,067 --> 01:23:12,833
I'm getting married to
Jim in ten minutes, but

1241
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:14,900
I don't know. Do you think
I'm doing the right thing?

1242
01:23:14,967 --> 01:23:16,567
Well...

1243
01:23:16,633 --> 01:23:19,067
I mean, which would be better?
Getting married, being a housewife,

1244
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:22,200
and having a bunch of kids
and getting old and fat, or...

1245
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:28,133
finish school and become
the first woman president?

1246
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:31,200
Well, Bunny, that's a
strictly personal decision.

1247
01:23:31,267 --> 01:23:33,800
Well, I'd rather just
be a housewife, but

1248
01:23:33,867 --> 01:23:36,833
I just don't want to disappoint
you after all you've taught me about...

1249
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:39,767
Bunny, Bunny! You don't have
to live your life to please me.

1250
01:23:39,833 --> 01:23:41,767
The important thing is that
you're happy.

1251
01:23:41,833 --> 01:23:44,167
And, as for what I've taught you,
well...

1252
01:23:44,233 --> 01:23:47,867
Listen, I've always believed that every
woman should get as much education

1253
01:23:47,933 --> 01:23:50,533
and intellectual stimulation as possible.

1254
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:55,067
And that she should develop her mental
abilities to their utmost potential.

1255
01:23:55,067 --> 01:23:59,633
But, in your case, well,
there's just no point.

1256
01:23:59,700 --> 01:24:02,333
Really? Then I should marry him.

1257
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:06,367
If that's what you want, yes.

1258
01:24:07,833 --> 01:24:09,800
I take it we haveyour blessing?

1259
01:24:10,367 --> 01:24:11,767
Don't push it.

1260
01:24:11,833 --> 01:24:13,067
Thank you.

1261
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:19,100
Then I will marry Jim.
But I just feel so sorry for you.

1262
01:24:19,167 --> 01:24:21,833
I'm going to be leaving youhere all
alone, and you'regoing to be losing

1263
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:23,367
one of your best students.

1264
01:24:23,433 --> 01:24:25,433
-Oh, who?
-Me!

1265
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:29,800
(LAUGHING) Oh! Well, don't worry,
Bunny. There'll be other students.

1266
01:24:29,867 --> 01:24:31,933
Well, this is it, Miss Hunt.

1267
01:24:32,967 --> 01:24:36,300
Bye! I'll call you. Collect.

1268
01:24:39,667 --> 01:24:41,733
Goodbye!
Thanks for everything!

1269
01:24:42,233 --> 01:24:43,233

Oh, Jean-Pierre! Good to see you!
Did you get all the classes you wanted?

1272
01:25:11,567 --> 01:25:14,533
Yes, I got all the courses
you told me to take.

Introduction to Feminism,
Understanding Human Relationships, and

The Sensitive Male.

1275
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:22,067
I want to thank you so much
for helping me, Dr. Hunt.

1276
01:25:22,067 --> 01:25:23,333
Oh, my pleasure.

1277
01:25:24,067 --> 01:25:25,533
