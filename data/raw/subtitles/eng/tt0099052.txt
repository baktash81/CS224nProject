1
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,269
Welcome.

2
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,550
Dr Atherton, I presume.

3
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,513
- Wait a minute, not so fast.
- We're in a hurry, Mr Manley.

4
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,394
Leave your personal things. Just bring
your equipment. We depart immediately.

5
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,193
Miguel Higueras, our field assistant.

6
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,437
Sorry I'm late. I've been held up in Caracas
for a while with a fever.

7
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,198
Tell the truth, I'm not over it yet.

8
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,197
Be sick on your own time, Mr Manley.

9
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,072
I want close-ups of every specimen

10
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,998
and coverage of the surrounding
rain forests and <i>tepuis.</i>

11
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,996
The what?

12
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,634
<i>Tepui.</i> It's an Indian word for mountain.

13
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,309
A place where species have survived
in isolation for millions of years.

14
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,112
Any man-eating dinosaurs?

15
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,597
Atherton, you're in luck.
We're hitting a brand-new one today.

16
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,551
Great. Anybody ever get lost?

17
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,990
Legend says men who climb
to the rain desert never return,

18
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,079
but don't worry, we small-game hunters
don't climb, we fly!

19
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,789
He friendly?

20
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,718
I hope so. He's our guide.

21
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,671
Stick close.

22
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,112
Twenty-four hour ant.

23
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,789
They bite?

24
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,390
They kill, Mr Manley,
in sufficient numbers.

25
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,836
So do some of the frogs.

26
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,188
Don't touch any.

27
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,879
Great.

28
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:53,110
This is where we're going.
We land here, then walk down here.

29
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,468
This is a sinkhole.

30
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,319
A place where thousands of years
of streaming water

31
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,158
have torn away the rock.

32
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,911
It's very deep. 2,000 feet.

33
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,679
And dark at the bottom.
We'll need flash equipment.

34
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,914
<i>Stegolepis.</i>

35
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,952
Edible and nutritious enough
to survive on for weeks.

36
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,559
Thanks, I'll pass.

37
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,079
Plants your specialty?

38
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,078
Insects and spiders
and identifying new ones.

39
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,510
Great. Just what the world needs.
More bugs.

40
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,560
What's your speciality, Manley?

41
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,159
Football.

42
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,836
Let's forget the fact that
no one mentioned poison ants and frogs,

43
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,791
but a 2,000-foot drop? Come on!

44
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,070
This is for the equipment.

45
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,668
Our guide will show us another way down.

46
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,753
What's with him?

47
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,916
This is as far as he'll go.

48
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,793
What?

49
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,475
It's amazing.

50
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,751
The air temp's dropped 10 degrees
in the last 100 meters.

51
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,279
Not far.

52
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,719
Down there.

53
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,679
- You all right?
- Yeah.

54
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,631
I'm fine, I just...

55
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,154
What'd he say?

56
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,236
He says you should be careful.
You're too big for us to carry out.

57
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,196
Wait up!

58
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,272
What does that thing do, anyway?

59
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,790
Did you ever throw a large firecracker
into a pond?

60
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,478
Maybe when I was a kid. Why?

61
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,875
What happened?

62
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,230
All sorts of stuff floated to the surface.

63
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,759
Exactly.

64
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,472
Everybody ready?

65
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,118
Prepare yourselves, gentlemen.

66
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,194
For what?

67
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,152
For pictures, Manley, pictures.

68
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,278
What is it?

69
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,198
I think it's a new species of butterfly.

70
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,118
We could call it... <i>photius manlii.</i>

71
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,594
Extraordinary.

72
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,676
Look at these markings.

73
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,791
Don't just sit there.

74
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,558
Are you sure it's dead?

75
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,716
Yes, quite dead.

76
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,716
Two more.

77
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,319
This is highly unusual.

78
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,113
So many spiders this size
in such a confined area.

79
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,231
Look at the shape of the abdomen.

80
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,669
We must try to find a live specimen.

81
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,156
- What do you think you're doing?
- It was alive.

82
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,952
Don't be ridiculous.

83
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,832
It's just a spider. What's the big deal?

84
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,871
It isn't just a spider.

85
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,831
It was potentially a new species of spider.

86
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,838
Isolated and unchanged
for millions of years.

87
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,712
And all you could do is squash it.

88
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,153
That's impossible. They should be dead.

89
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,793
Very aggressive.

90
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,434
We'll take two back alive and preserve two.

91
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,153
Are you sure that'll do it?

92
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,316
This stuff will kill an elephant.

93
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,150
Millions of years, then we come along.

94
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,554
How long's it gonna take us
to get back to camp?

95
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,592
What's the matter?
You still worried about dinosaurs?

96
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,632
This place just gives me the creeps.

97
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,713
Incredible.

98
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,829
What is?

99
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,952
These spiders have
no reproductive organs.

100
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,753
Almost like worker bees or soldier ants.

101
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,439
Yeah, well, if these are the soldiers,
I'd hate to see the general.

102
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,073
How are you feeling?

103
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,589
Like hell. This fever's killing me.

104
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,871
You don't look so good. Take a rest.

105
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,918
The fever.

106
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,031
Make sure we've got
all his film, Higueras.

107
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,593
Have we notified his family?

108
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,631
I contacted the American consulate.

109
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,438
Okay, seal him up.

110
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,876
I really wish you wouldn't
complain about my driving.

111
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,910
Ready?

112
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,110
You're pushing it. That's all I got to say.

113
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,878
Take it easy, wait.

114
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,436
Can you give me a hand here?

115
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,151
I think I'll go move the hearse.

116
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,954
Dick, I'm sorry to pester you
in this already difficult time.

117
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,277
I know that we already decided
on an open casket,

118
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,597
but we should maybe reconsider.

119
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,551
Because I'm not sure
how they work down in South America,

120
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,719
but let me say that their
preservation methods differ from ours.

121
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:24,911
No, you'd be welcome
to come down and decide,

122
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:29,238
but in this already difficult time,
I'm not sure I could do that.

123
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,475
No, you do have the option of...

124
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,319
We could put a photograph
on top of the casket.

125
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,948
No, the one that you had
in the newspaper.

126
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,076
Okay, kids, go stake out your rooms!

127
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,155
Ross, smell that air!

128
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,235
Let's just...

129
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,908
Before we discover what valuables
broke in the move,

130
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,996
and that the breakfront doesn't fit,

131
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,590
let's just chant twice:

132
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,597
"We did the right thing."

133
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,149
- For the kids.
- For us. For all of us.

134
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,351
- Goodbye crime, goodbye grime.
- Right.

135
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,596
Goodbye culture, goodbye friends.

136
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,759
Dad, there's a dead bird over here!

137
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,838
Don't touch it.

138
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,269
Just go on into the house
and find your sister.

139
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,317
Ross, the entire town is yours.

140
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,512
You're the doctor.
Can there be a more respected figure?

141
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,679
Respect is fine, but actually
I've always wanted to be feared.

142
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,712
Easy with that.

143
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,274
You don't want to agitate the sediments.

144
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,553
ChÃ¢teau Margaux. $127 a bottle.

145
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,076
Tasty, huh?

146
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,509
At that price, who can afford to drink it?

147
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,710
Goes in the basement.

148
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,912
I mean the cellar.

149
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,872
The wine cellar.

150
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,997
I gotta get a big padlock.
Protect my investment.

151
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,838
Dad!

152
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,358
- What's wrong?
- Behind one of the boxes, a spider.

153
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,918
It came at me, it was ugly.

154
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,110
- Bigger than this.
- Okay, calm down.

155
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,549
You're in the country now, okay?

156
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,875
Come on, let's go find that spider.

157
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,958
And let's find your mom
to take care of that spider.

158
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,709
Honey, we're in the living room.
We need you to kill a spider.

159
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,751
All right. Where is it?

160
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,359
Over there, on the box.

161
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,959
Killing a spider, cool!

162
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,435
It's bad luck to kill a spider
in a new house.

163
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,357
You just made that up, didn't you, dear?

164
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,834
Okay. Everything's okay.

165
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,079
Poor thing.

166
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,509
It's more scared of us than we are of it.

167
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,949
Let's give it a home in the barn.

168
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,399
Good idea, Shell.

169
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,078
Mom, how come you're not
afraid of bugs like Dad is?

170
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,998
I'm not afraid of all bugs. Just...

171
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,554
- Be careful of rusty nails.
- Chill out.

172
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,750
How about right here?

173
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,758
You sure you won't miss
being in the thick of things?

174
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,916
With all those stars and those crickets
singing, we are in the thick of things.

175
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,759
I mean work. Strokes from the boss.

176
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:44,670
Christmas bonuses, office politics,
caffeine, adrenaline,

177
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,711
steady income...

178
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,198
We'll be fine.

179
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:53,950
Between my severance and all your
potential patients, we'll be fine.

180
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,389
When are you meeting with Dr Metcalf?

181
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,635
Thursday morning.

182
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,752
The old coot passes me the torch
at 10.00 sharp.

183
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,314
Wait.

184
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,115
We can unpack in the morning.

185
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,360
I have some Napoleon brandy
in the basement.

186
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,439
Sorry, cellar.

187
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,028
Ross, I'm exhausted.

188
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,675
It's bad luck not to make love
the first night in a new house.

189
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,314
You just made that up, didn't you, dear?

190
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:57,274
I have terrific news. At least,
I think, for my patients it's terrific.

191
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,755
Though my wife is less than thrilled.

192
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,552
What's that, Dr Metcalf?

193
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,750
I've decided to postpone retirement.

194
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,636
I don't know for how long, but...

195
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,194
But?

196
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,517
But when I thought really hard about it,
I realised,

197
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,598
there's only one thing left
to do when you retire,

198
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,473
and I've seen too many friends
do that very thing

199
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,751
just six months, a year
after they gave up their professions.

200
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,313
But you...

201
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,113
When we spoke just four months ago,
you assured me that...

202
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,196
I'm not ready to retire, doctor.

203
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:35,359
And if my wife can't rush me into it,
you sure as hell can't either.

204
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,675
Excuse me.

205
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,633
You gotta feed the meter, partner.

206
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,276
Yeah, well, I was just leaving.

207
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,311
A little late, though.

208
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,797
I do have medical plates.

209
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,117
Oh, right. You're that new doctor.

210
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,800
- Ross Jennings.
- Sheriff Lloyd Parsons.

211
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,195
You're a Yale grad, I heard.

212
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,878
That's right.

213
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,390
Well, it's just a school, isn't it?

214
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,999
That's enough, Lloyd Parsons.

215
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,351
A young doctor comes to Canaima
and you write him a parking ticket?

216
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,472
- What are you doing, Ms Hollins?
- What the whole town ought to do.

217
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,352
Your ticker tape parade.

218
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,391
- Thank you.
- That's littering.

219
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,351
Lloyd's been a bully since the 5th grade.

220
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,277
I ought to know, I held him back.

221
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,072
Walk me to my automobile.

222
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,117
Thank you for the swift intervention.

223
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,595
- How did you know who I was?
- We're neighbours.

224
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,518
I gave you a standing ovation
when you arrived.

225
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,959
Between you and me, Sam Metcalf
only recently gave up leeches.

226
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,753
He also recently gave up retirement.

227
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,110
We moved from San Francisco
with the understanding

228
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,915
that I would inherit all of his patients,
but now I have none.

229
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,350
No, Dr Jennings, you have one.

230
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,556
Honey, look at this light.

231
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:20,036
On the best day in the city,
we didn't get light like this.

232
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,878
Maybe they'll give me a show in town.

233
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,753
Don't they do that in little towns?
In the town hall?

234
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,269
"Molly Jennings, a retrospective."

235
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,153
Of course, I'll need to
take some pictures first.

236
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,352
There's good news and there's bad news.

237
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,870
Should we go in reverse-alphabetical
order and start with the good?

238
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,473
I'm seeing my first patient this afternoon.

239
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,955
She's a great old dame,
she lives just up the road.

240
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,196
Terrific. What's the bad news?

241
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,788
She's my only patient.

242
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,549
Today?

243
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,911
Metcalf changed his mind.

244
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,636
- What?
- Yeah.

245
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,751
He panicked, is what it is.

246
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,836
He decided that if he retires

247
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,909
he will lose his zest for life
and die within 48 hours or something.

248
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,519
But he told you.

249
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,790
We looked in 14 towns,
we bought a house,

250
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,717
you rented an office.

251
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,592
What are we going to do?

252
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,312
Kill him?

253
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,071
I have my fax machine.
I can work part-time from here.

254
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,193
A phone and a fax, that's all I need.
I'll call my old clients.

255
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,959
- Even with half my commissions...
- We're gonna be fine.

256
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,036
- Just like you said.
- With one patient?

257
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:38,438
Maybe I'll get lucky and all of her systems
will be ravaged by disease.

258
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,835
Kind of like having seven patients in one.

259
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,351
Fit as a fiddle.

260
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,512
Not a damn thing wrong with you.

261
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,710
Dr Jennings, I'm sorry.

262
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:57,038
What do you mean? Do you think I was
hoping you were ravaged by disease?

263
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,355
What about my high blood pressure?

264
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,510
You have above-normal systolic pressure,

265
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,995
which is less dangerous
than a diastolic elevation.

266
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,032
And yours is well below a level
that requires treatment.

267
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,798
Do I need these?

268
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,438
No.

269
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:18,314
See, there's a difference between
the two types of hypertension.

270
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,589
And in my opinion...

271
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:24,669
In my opinion, Dr Metcalf doesn't know
his ass from a hole in the ground.

272
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,268
But Canaima folks,
they're comfortable with him.

273
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,436
They weren't always, though.

274
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,519
When he first hit town just after the war,
everyone was terribly standoffish.

275
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:37,076
- How'd he overcome that?
- He threw a party, invited the whole town.

276
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,829
If Sam Metcalf were half as good
at medicine

277
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,317
as he is at public relations,
he could run for the next surgeon general.

278
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,917
That's it. Next month,
when the afternoons are cooler

279
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,110
we'll throw you a party.

280
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,118
Thanks.

281
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,158
So, your one patient,
is she a walking health hazard?

282
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,475
I couldn't even find a wart on her.

283
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,037
Great, so what do we do?

284
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,398
Enjoy the fact that since we
no longer live in San Francisco,

285
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,397
we no longer have to refer to this as pasta.

286
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,432
- Skinny spaghetti.
- Daddy's not done.

287
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,675
On the bright side,

288
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,509
Margaret, my tragically healthy patient,

289
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,200
has offered to throw us
a "Get to know Dr Jennings" party.

290
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,230
Daddy's not done.

291
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,630
One cup of punch
with the handsome new GP

292
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,594
and the good people of Canaima will see
the light and abandon old Doc Metcalf.

293
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,154
- It's a nice gesture.
- Yeah.

294
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,633
Can we go play with Bunny?

295
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,228
Yeah, I want you both in
before dark, though.

296
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,633
Bunny Beechwood.
She popped over this morning.

297
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,557
A neighbour. Seems nice.

298
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,033
What do you bet they're gonna
go chase fireflies or something?

299
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,194
- Wanna blow up a bullfrog?
- Okay!

300
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,910
I got some great shots in the barn today.

301
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,476
If the camera picks up the web
with half the detail my eyes do...

302
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,192
The web?

303
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,877
Yeah, our little spider
made himself a hell of a home.

304
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,594
I think even you would appreciate it.

305
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,553
Molly... how can I make this more clear?

306
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,308
- I have...
- A terrible fear of spiders.

307
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,000
I'm aware, I've seen what happens.

308
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:45,193
Which is why I think you should force
yourself to come and look at the web.

309
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,594
Look at the web?

310
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,952
Yes, and see it for the extraordinary
and beautiful thing it is.

311
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,638
Therapy, Ross.

312
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,273
We live in the country now.

313
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:58,075
It's time to work through
this irrational, paralysing terror.

314
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,398
- It's not irrational.
- I know.

315
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,351
The incident.

316
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,118
It's like it happened yesterday.

317
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,152
Nobody remembers anything
from when they were two.

318
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,718
It's my first memory.

319
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,518
I can envision the crib,

320
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,074
all around me, clear as day.

321
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,111
I can still feel the feeling of waking up.

322
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,516
Just drowsy, peaceful, secure,
then there it was.

323
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,871
- Probably just a daddy longlegs.
- It seemed huge.

324
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,915
It just came relentlessly,
crawling through the bars of the crib.

325
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,191
- As it touched my bare leg...
- I know, you were just wearing a diaper.

326
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,357
All my limbs involuntarily froze.

327
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,152
You were probably still half-asleep.

328
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,874
I was paralysed, Molly.
I still get paralysed.

329
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,036
Try to understand how this makes me feel.

330
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:47,995
I was physically unable to stop it
from crawling along my naked skin.

331
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,511
I can still
feel its hairy little legs just...

332
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,873
Then up to my face.

333
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,837
It's the feeling
of utter helplessness.

334
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,430
Being explored by an alien thing,
that's all.

335
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,437
Can you blame me
for being a spider-phobe?

336
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,117
Arachnophobe.

337
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,798
Whatever.

338
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,509
You see it up there,
right beyond the ladder.

339
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,719
Impressive, huh?

340
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,358
Therapy, right?

341
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,833
Right.

342
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,593
Oh, God.

343
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,830
There, you see?
You still have full use of all your limbs.

344
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,149
Have you seen it up here?

345
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,718
I think you spared the eight-legged
Frank Lloyd Wright.

346
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,758
Are you okay? Honey, it's okay!

347
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,518
What the hell was that?

348
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,790
It's...

349
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,999
Come on.

350
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,429
Jesus!

351
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,715
Hold me!

352
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,432
Oh, my God!

353
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,516
# <i>The summer wind came blowing in</i>

354
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,552
# <i>From across the sea</i>

355
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,558
How are you finding life here?

356
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:52,229
After a few initial shocks,
we're slowly adjusting, I think.

357
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,635
I've been checking on you, Ross.

358
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:58,309
Henry, when I'm finally ready
to throw in the towel,

359
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,032
Dr Jennings is your man.

360
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,549
- Henry Beechwood.
- Ross Jennings.

361
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:06,150
- By all accounts, a fine physician.
- I'll remember that.

362
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,751
This brings back memories.

363
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,958
Right after the war,
when I moved to Canaima,

364
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,196
the whole town threw me a party.

365
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,958
You threw yourself a party.

366
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,832
Now that was a party!

367
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,235
Now that is a jerk!

368
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,550
- Canaima welcomes you.
- Thank you.

369
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,796
Listen, I was interested in something.

370
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,911
I wonder if you could give me a little help.

371
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,032
Do you think
that I should have this removed?

372
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,230
What's Bunny showing them over there?

373
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:05,238
Hand-to-hand combat techniques.

374
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,599
So Becky, have you thought about
what you'll major in at college?

375
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,755
Gym.

376
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,348
It's in the genes.

377
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,278
Bobby here,
he's the Broncos' star quarterback.

378
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,156
I taught him to throw a football
before he could walk.

379
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,759
I coach the team.

380
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,438
Nepotism, huh?

381
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,357
Actually, we're Baptists.

382
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,199
Nobody comes up to a mortician
at a party and says,

383
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,788
"Irv, you think I might be dead?"

384
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,036
Must drive you nuts
trying to dip your Dorito

385
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,628
while somebody's showing you his growth.

386
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,637
How do you handle it?

387
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,788
I just mention that until quite recently
my wife was a successful stockbroker.

388
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,598
Say, what do you think about that...

389
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,156
- Why shouldn't I have another?
- Because you've had too much already.

390
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,191
- Let's go.
- No, I'm thirsty.

391
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,356
That's the Manleys.

392
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,789
Their son recently passed away.

393
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,319
That's awful. How?

394
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,396
I'm not sure. He was a scientist.

395
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,953
Photographer.

396
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,196
He was on a scientific expedition down in...

397
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,992
Venezuela.

398
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,594
Nobody'd tell me how.

399
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,996
- Or even let me see him to say goodbye.
- Let's go.

400
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,839
I had to recommend a closed coffin.

401
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,315
His body looked all chewed up.

402
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,192
Drained.

403
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:38,314
Like some vampire had had a go at him.
It was terrible.

404
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,118
Excuse us.

405
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:52,478
I'll be you made enough friends today
to break Sam Metcalf's death-grip.

406
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,989
It was wonderful.
We can't thank you enough.

407
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,553
Nor I you.

408
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,194
Freeing me from those damn pills.

409
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,471
I feel I could compete in a triathlon.

410
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,319
On the basis of your check-up,
I tend to agree.

411
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,351
- Bye-bye, Margaret.
- Bye, Molly.

412
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,993
Irv, Claire. Would you like a doggy bag?

413
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:17,112
We're fine, thank you.
Great party, Margaret!

414
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,476
Come on, honey. Party's over.

415
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,952
Happy hunting, Felix.
See you in the morning.

416
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:53,589
You'd have had too much punch
and been the life of the party.

417
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,236
I missed you.

418
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,389
Ross!

419
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:12,715
I could have killed one of you.
The nails came straight...

420
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,073
It's all rotten down there.

421
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,875
My wine cellar is...
It's probably crawling with termites.

422
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,955
I'm surprised
we haven't fallen through the floor.

423
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,310
I'll call the exterminator.

424
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,870
You're rather casual
about the death of my dream.

425
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,639
I've been trying to reach Margaret
to thank her

426
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,478
and her line's been busy all morning.

427
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,875
She's probably gabbing.

428
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,192
- You want me to...
- Would you?

429
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,231
I'll go over and check on her.

430
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,313
Margaret?

431
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,272
So what do you think, doc?

432
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,072
Heart attack.

433
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,794
Bound to happen, rather sooner than later.

434
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:27,878
She had a history of high blood pressure.

435
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,560
- Even with the pills I put her on...
- I took her off those.

436
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,830
What right did you have to do that?

437
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,712
She came to me. As a patient.

438
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,956
You didn't notice she was hypertensive?

439
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,355
Her diastolic reading was normal.

440
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,789
Her systolic elevation was below 160.

441
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,276
- If you'd stayed current...
- This is a very serious matter, young man.

442
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:52,558
- You may well have killed this woman.
- I don't think so. She was in fine shape.

443
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,557
- I want an autopsy.
- Never.

444
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,079
Look, she was my patient.

445
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,918
And mine for 40 years.

446
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:02,479
Margaret wouldn't want to be butchered.
And nobody here would want that for her.

447
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,397
Give it to me, Irv.

448
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,590
I'm satisfied if you're satisfied, doc.

449
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,554
You come from a big city
where people don't care about each other.

450
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,989
I don't expect you'd understand.

451
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,678
A little advice.

452
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,836
If you're ever going to fit in in Canaima,

453
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:20,474
learn to be sensitive to
the feelings of the people here.

454
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:24,036
I'm sorry I'm more interested
in medicine than public relations!

455
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,755
You know, cardiac victims
don't usually bite their tongues off.

456
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:30,519
It's as though she went
into titanic convulsions.

457
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,518
Until I know why, this case isn't closed.

458
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:37,828
You're damn right it's not. I believe
you may be guilty of medical malpractice.

459
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:40,758
And I intend to pursue the matter
to its conclusion.

460
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:54,752
Ross, I understand she was your patient.
Your only patient.

461
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,030
Why don't you come by the gym
tomorrow at 3.00?

462
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,673
It's a mile up the road from you.

463
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,552
I'll throw some business your way.

464
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,352
Thank you, Henry.

465
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,152
I appreciate that.

466
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,871
That was nice of him.

467
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,275
Think he could have said it a little louder?

468
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,548
A little young, isn't it?

469
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:29,954
The wine?

470
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,510
No, Margaret. To die at 68.

471
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:43,272
That's ten years below the life expectancy
of a Caucasian female. Did you know that?

472
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,231
Ross, you're a fine doctor.

473
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:51,399
I'm sure you knew exactly what you were
doing when you took her off those pills.

474
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,318
Like I knew what I was doing
when I chose this town?

475
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:57,159
With the country doctor from hell.

476
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:01,910
Or this fine house,
which is rotting from the ground up.

477
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,429
I'm gonna take care of that in the morning.

478
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,677
Well, Margaret's still
gonna be dead in the morning.

479
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,710
I still want to know what killed her.

480
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:35,037
He was nailing something in the cellar
and the wood just disintegrated.

481
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,593
Termites, huh?

482
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,676
That's what my husband thought.

483
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:43,032
- And he's an expert in these matters?
- Well... no.

484
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:45,196
Didn't think so.

485
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:47,629
I'm glad you called me.

486
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,920
No room for amateurs in this game.

487
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,597
Thank you.

488
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,234
What is it?

489
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:22,510
It's hard to say.

490
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,598
Would anybody object
if I tore this floor out?

491
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:28,075
- I would.
- False alarm, then. Lead on.

492
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,358
How bad is it?

493
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,157
I didn't find a thing. Go figure.

494
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,919
Then why is all the wood rotting?

495
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:41,758
I'll tell you why.

496
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,712
Bad wood.

497
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:46,831
So... what do we do?

498
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:50,035
Tear out bad wood.

499
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,878
Put in good wood.

500
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:57,030
My husband thought
this would make a good wine cellar.

501
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,469
I collect beer cans myself.

502
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:02,956
I got a rare '74 of Miller Lite
with a misprint on the label.

503
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:06,152
Only a hundred or so cans in circulation.

504
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,430
The husband just might want to
take a gander.

505
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,516
No hard shoes on the court.

506
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:12,436
Sorry.

507
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,950
Look, I know what a blow
losing Margaret was for you.

508
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:19,436
People keep score.
You're only as good as your last game.

509
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:22,472
- Hell, I ought to know.
- I appreciate your concern, Henry.

510
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,352
I want you to enjoy Canaima.

511
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,152
Clean water, fresh air.

512
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,953
Got no police sirens wailing all night.

513
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,992
Just crickets.
We have crickets up the wazoo.

514
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:37,358
Actually, I haven't heard any crickets
lately, now that you mention it.

515
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,516
Actually, I haven't either.

516
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:41,358
Okay, Broncos, the doc's here!

517
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,471
Get ready to drop 'em.

518
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,476
The doc wants to hear you cough.

519
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,431
You call yourself Broncos?

520
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,915
You look like a bunch of babies.
Come on!

521
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,194
You're moving in slow motion here.

522
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:00,270
That's supposed to be a banana out.
Looks like a banana split!

523
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,992
- Shitty pass.
- I heard that!

524
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,712
What are you, a garbage mouth?

525
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,398
Hit the showers.

526
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,112
Wash that mouth out. Miller!

527
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:11,552
- You know the patterns?
- Like the back of my hand.

528
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:15,514
Get in here. Run the same thing again.
Hurry up.

529
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:18,712
Come on, Miller.
We're waiting on you, let's go!

530
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:20,751
Come on! Move it! You wanna play?

531
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,757
Come on, run. Let's go.

532
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,039
Thanks.

533
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,478
Run it.

534
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:41,998
Up. Let's go.

535
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,750
Miller, you all right?

536
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,269
- Coach!
- What's wrong with Miller?

537
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:54,878
Back up, let him breathe.

538
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,991
What's wrong? What is it?

539
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,838
Come on, give us some air.

540
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,560
Let's get his helmet off.

541
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,797
Real easy. Support his head, coach.

542
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,876
Real gentle.

543
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:30,876
From what I hear,
it wasn't a very hard tackle.

544
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,835
I only wish I knew, you see

545
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,679
Dr Jennings examined him last.

546
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,712
Why so gloomy?

547
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:56,432
Bunny Beechwood says that
everybody's calling you Dr Death.

548
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,955
That's just silly, Shelley.

549
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:03,478
And they say you want to
cut people up into little pieces.

550
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,591
Tom, look...

551
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,312
It's called an autopsy.

552
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:10,314
It's not a very pleasant thing,

553
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:15,230
but sometimes it's the only way to find out
what really happened to a person.

554
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:18,557
But some doctors who should know better
won't accept that.

555
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,953
But some doctors who should know better
just won't accept

556
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:25,117
that their big-city methods
don't sit well in a small town.

557
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:29,799
Both Margaret and that poor boy
did seem to be quite healthy.

558
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,434
It's a bit odd, don't you think, Sam?

559
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:35,120
If I autopsied everyone
who ever died of a heart attack

560
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:38,073
I'd be run out of Canaima so fast...

561
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:42,079
Poor Sam. You still think life is
a popularity contest.

562
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,912
You're not jealous of
our new young doctor, are you?

563
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,712
What?

564
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,671
Now you made me lose my timing.

565
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,392
You're yelling, Sam.

566
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:55,432
Come on to bed.

567
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:00,076
I need a shower.

568
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:03,590
I'd love to start taking walks
around the neighbourhood with you.

569
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:06,075
It's not the same thing, Evelyn.

570
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,395
I need to know exactly how far I've gone

571
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,788
and exactly how long it took me.

572
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,672
Floor's cold, Sam.

573
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,712
You're right. You're always right.

574
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,355
Damn!

575
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:26,838
- What's wrong?
- Some damn thing bit me.

576
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:31,274
It's just a spider.

577
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,834
Spider? Felt like a damn cougar.

578
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,188
Damn!

579
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,913
I'm having a seizure.

580
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:42,156
Sam, what should I do?

581
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:44,430
Ambulance. Call Jennings.

582
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,872
I'll be right there.

583
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:57,752
- What's going on?
- Metcalf. He's having a seizure.

584
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,029
Thank God you didn't
examine <i>him</i> this morning.

585
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:08,391
- What's the coroner doing here?
- I don't know.

586
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:11,437
Milt! This isn't necessary.

587
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,596
I'll be the judge of that, Lloyd.

588
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:15,438
Wait out here.

589
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:18,632
Guard the house or something.

590
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,515
Was he alive when you got here?

591
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:27,278
He'd been dead maybe five minutes.

592
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,789
Whatever it was, it was abrupt and acute.

593
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,554
What's your guess? Massive coronary?
Cerebral haemorrhage?

594
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:37,752
His wife says he was bitten by a spider
just before he seized.

595
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,917
Oh, right.

596
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,235
Sam told me about you.

597
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:46,750
You're the hot shot who won't accept
anyone else's diagnosis.

598
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,075
I'll accept it if I agree with it.

599
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:51,995
Good.

600
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:54,315
Let me show you something.

601
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:56,032
Down here.

602
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,111
I believe that's a spider bite.

603
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:05,357
I'll buy that.

604
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:07,311
But I rather doubt that's what killed him

605
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,955
In twenty years,
I've seen only one spider-bite fatality.

606
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:14,277
And that involved a black widow
and a one-year-old child.

607
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,313
No. My guess is that
Sam overexerted himself.

608
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:21,716
His wife said he was using the treadmill
just before he keeled over.

609
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:24,195
You may be right.

610
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,519
I want a full autopsy.

611
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:29,677
Tissue samples, blood toxicology,
the whole nine yards.

612
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,711
- Wait just one second.
- Shut up, Lloyd.

613
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:34,513
- You'll get Evelyn's permission, of course.
- Of course.

614
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:37,552
- You need a ride home?
- No, I'm all right, thanks.

615
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,990
You better take care of yourself now.
You're the town doctor.

616
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:43,118
Say "Aahh."

617
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:49,873
Okay, I think we're gonna
treat this inflammation with antibiotics.

618
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:54,389
Does this mean
I don't get any ice cream?

619
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:56,431
I'll buy you a double scoop
on the way home.

620
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,312
Who's next?

621
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:00,829
I'll take that. Thank you very much.

622
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,951
Step right this way.

623
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:05,150
Just have a seat. I'll be right with you.

624
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,270
Okay, hot shot. Are you sitting down?

625
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:16,550
According to preliminary data,
Sam Metcalf died as the result of

626
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:21,435
a minute amount of an as yet unidentified
toxic substance in his bloodstream.

627
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:25,988
<i>My office isn't ruling out accidental</i>
<i>poisoning, deliberate poisoning</i>

628
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:28,395
<i>or even killer spiders.</i>

629
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:32,354
<i>At the moment,</i>
<i>it looks like a heart attack to me.</i>

630
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:35,153
<i>But I'll support</i>
<i>whatever you'd like to do.</i>

631
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,794
I gotta have those bodies exhumed.

632
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,388
I gotta be sure.

633
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:41,919
Okay.

634
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,756
Whatever you think is necessary.

635
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:45,995
Thanks.

636
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,678
Are you out of your mind?

637
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,995
Slowly and once more, Lloyd -

638
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:53,635
I want Margaret Hollins'
and Todd Miller's bodies exhumed.

639
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,432
Dug up.

640
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:02,314
You start pulling citizens out of the ground
that should be enjoying eternal rest

641
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:04,510
and that roomful of patients
will disappear...

642
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:08,553
I'll just get a court order.
Milt Briggs is on my side.

643
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:15,279
This is a very bad business,
Mr Yale-graduate-big-city doctor!

644
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,356
A very bad business!

645
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:18,913
No shit!

646
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,350
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, honey.

647
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:33,674
What's going on?

648
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:36,678
I promised Shelley
she could spend the night with Bunny.

649
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:38,950
We'll take good care of her.

650
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,793
Wait.

651
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,992
There may be some spiders around here
that are very dangerous.

652
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:52,395
Okay? I just want you girls
to be aware of this.

653
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:56,115
If you should see one,
don't try to capture it or kill it.

654
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:00,034
Just run, you understand?

655
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:05,870
- Run!
- We'll do that, Dr Jennings.

656
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,594
You don't have to worry about anything.

657
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,278
Dr Death!

658
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:16,316
Are you all right?

659
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:17,953
No.

660
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:31,195
All clear.

661
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:39,638
The spider didn't answer.
She had fallen asleep.

662
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:43,070
It had been a very, very busy day.

663
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,838
Okay, your turn, Bunny.

664
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:49,351
The itsy bitsy spider

665
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:53,272
Crawled up the water spout

666
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:57,871
Down came the rain
and washed the spider out

667
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:03,073
Out came the sun
and dried up all the rain

668
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:08,513
And the itsy bitsy spider
crawled up the spout again

669
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,996
It's my turn now.

670
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:13,509
Little Miss Muffet sat on a tuffet

671
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,790
Eating her curds and whey

672
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,195
And along came a spider

673
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:20,515
That sat down beside her

674
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,358
And frightened Miss Muffet...

675
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:26,756
If you girls don't settle down
then Shelley can't stay over any more.

676
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,348
- We can't sleep.
- We keep scaring each other.

677
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:31,869
Why don't you two
go sleep in my room for a while?

678
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,355
Okay. Nah, we don't need this.

679
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,955
Son of a bitch.

680
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:41,640
Where are all the other crickets?

681
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,716
Where are all your buddies?

682
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:14,034
Atherton.

683
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:16,071
Yes, Dr Atherton.

684
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,432
I'm Ross Jennings.

685
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:20,994
I'm a general practitioner, and I...

686
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:25,079
I have a problem
that may be spider-related.

687
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,760
You seem to be the foremost authority
on the West Coast.

688
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:30,474
Or any coast, for that matter.

689
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:32,875
Dr Jennings, let me tell you that

690
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:37,152
every so often in a little town somewhere
there is a health scare,

691
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:41,239
some unexplained outbreak,
and spiders make convenient culprits.

692
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:44,394
<i>Did you know that on every suburban acre</i>

693
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:47,830
there are at least 50 to 60,000 spiders?

694
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:51,999
And that each spider eats
about 100 insects per year?

695
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:57,311
<i>That means at least 5 million insects</i>
<i>are consumed per acre annually.</i>

696
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:00,351
Think about it, doctor.

697
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:04,189
Perhaps man might find the planet
uninhabitable <i>without</i> spiders.

698
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:06,788
<i>Dr Atherton,</i>
<i>I have nothing against spiders.</i>

699
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:09,070
<i>It's just we have had three deaths</i>
<i>in my town</i>

700
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,395
<i>and I'm afraid</i>
<i>there's going to be some more.</i>

701
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:14,910
<i>If you could lend me your expertise,</i>
<i>forjust an afternoon...</i>

702
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:18,350
We're really not that far from you.
It's a town called Canaima.

703
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:21,674
<i>You know it?</i>

704
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,631
It's familiar.

705
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:27,113
Let me see what I can do.
Where are you exactly?

706
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,515
Collins?

707
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:42,350
- Sorry.
- Are you equally busy tomorrow?

708
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:05,073
Dr Atherton?

709
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,634
No, I'm Chris Collins, one of his assistants.

710
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:10,320
Hi, I'm Chris.
Atherton's really busy lately.

711
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:15,116
He's recently discovered a new species
of spider. Down in South America.

712
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:18,032
To us, it's a big deal.

713
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:23,116
I hope you'll be able to help us.
We're going to be examining some bodies.

714
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:25,629
It sounds like a blast.

715
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,511
We're looking for bites.

716
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:32,910
Like this. That's a spider, isn't it?

717
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:37,278
I'm not sure.

718
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,595
I think so.

719
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:42,553
But even at several times
the potency of <i>latrodectus.</i>

720
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:45,113
- Black widow, right?
- Right.

721
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:47,629
Even then it would take
more than one bite to kill,

722
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:52,629
so I figure this guy's death and the spider
bite, if it a spider bite, are coincidental.

723
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:55,071
Hey, guys, how's it going?

724
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:58,111
Poor Margaret.

725
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:01,118
She was a good wife, good teacher,
good neighbour.

726
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:03,879
Excellent cook.

727
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,911
Anything you want, just shout.

728
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:10,719
I want some fresh air.

729
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:13,115
Chris, come here.

730
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,675
Still think it's a coincidence?

731
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,597
That's a spider bite.

732
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:25,915
The tissue surrounding the bite
is macerated.

733
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:27,393
Found one.

734
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,112
A mark behind the left ear.

735
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:37,753
- Atherton.
- <i>Dr Atherton, Chris Collins.</i>

736
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:40,150
<i>I think we've got a big problem</i>
<i>here in Canaima.</i>

737
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:41,679
<i>They've got three dead bodies.</i>

738
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:46,112
<i>The cause of death seems to be a spider</i>
<i>more deadly than any I've ever seen.</i>

739
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:49,277
<i>They want the okay</i>
<i>to quarantine the town.</i>

740
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:52,915
- Are you sure?
- This is way out of my league.

741
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:56,350
I think you'd better come up here
right away.

742
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:01,080
I can be there tomorrow afternoon.

743
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:04,397
But Collins, try and find me a specimen.

744
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:27,758
Did you bring the keys?

745
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:28,995
Great.

746
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:30,872
Perk up, Lloyd.

747
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,878
If we find the spider that did this,
you can arrest him.

748
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:48,713
Milt, why don't you cover the living room?

749
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:52,271
Chris, why don't you check out back?

750
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:56,758
Lloyd, take the kitchen.

751
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:01,869
And I'll just... I'll oversee the...
I'll just coordinate the...

752
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:05,039
I'll just stay right here.

753
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,831
What is all that crap?

754
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:17,918
Leftovers.
Mostly cricket parts, wings, legs.

755
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:23,670
We haven't heard any crickets in Canaima
these past few weeks.

756
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:33,398
Ross, here!

757
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:34,748
Don't move!

758
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:39,230
- It's dead. Shit!
- What could have killed it?

759
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:42,391
The shock of seeing Lloyd?

760
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:52,795
There are other people in this house.

761
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:54,751
Dad, go away!

762
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:00,315
Use the one down here!

763
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:01,076
Never a moment's peace.

764
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:05,716
What happened? Are you all right?

765
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:18,158
Why don't we just take the dead spider
and get out of here?

766
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:22,034
You don't get off that easy. It's already
desiccated. It wouldn't be any use to us.

767
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:23,912
You mean macerated.

768
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:27,191
No, I mean desiccated.
Dried up, drained of all its blood.

769
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:29,754
Macerated is the... chewing that they do.

770
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:35,274
They're like little vampires.

771
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:38,312
This trip of Atherton's to find
the spider species, where'd he go?

772
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:40,590
South America.

773
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:42,233
Venezuela, why?

774
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:49,678
Is that one of them?

775
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:51,631
I'd say it's a damn fine suspect.

776
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:04,314
Ross, you're going to have
to take a step towards it.

777
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:10,836
- Chris, I'm scared to death.
- We all are.

778
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:15,511
But our brains secrete a neurotransmitter
that enables us to deal with them.

779
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:18,677
I don't think I have
that particular neurotransmitter.

780
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:20,788
Yes, you do.

781
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:47,878
You need an asbestos glove.

782
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,468
Doomsday weapon in Delbert's war
on a creepy crawler.

783
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:55,037
I coat it with Demon EC,
insecticide with environmental conscience.

784
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:57,993
It's biodegradable. Organic.

785
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:02,511
You ought to see the little beasties twitch
when they get a whiff of this stuff.

786
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:12,118
Now, Delbert...

787
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:18,228
There's a rumour going around that
some kind of spider killed Sam Metcalf.

788
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:20,635
Maybe Margaret, maybe even my Bronco.

789
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:23,193
Doubtful, Henry.

790
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:28,037
In a case in Florida one of my colleagues
bumped into a nest of black widows.

791
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:30,515
Sustained over a dozen bites and lived.

792
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:40,875
Of course, he probably lost control
of all of his bodily functions.

793
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,592
There's no spider here.

794
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:45,553
But I will hunt down the alleged arachnid

795
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:48,151
and spritz him to kingdom come.

796
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:32,790
Yeah, that's right.

797
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:34,069
I'm bad.

798
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,791
Dr Atherton, Ross Jennings.

799
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:48,478
Come in.

800
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:51,150
Did you find me another specimen?

801
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:53,953
Yes, I did.
I also paid a call to the town mortician.

802
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:57,040
Several months ago, there was a corpse.

803
01:13:57,160 --> 01:14:00,516
The body was desiccated,
it was totally drained of blood.

804
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:02,596
Irv agreed that
if the spider was big enough

805
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:06,474
and it spent a long enough time
working on that body...

806
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:09,398
I think I know
why you've heard of Canaima.

807
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:12,036
This was Jerry Manley's home town.

808
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:16,031
- Manley the photographer?
- Yeah.

809
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:20,479
I think one of your Venezuelan spiders
hitched a ride here in Manley's coffin.

810
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:29,830
The fangs, the injectors,
are disproportionately large.

811
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:32,190
Three poison sacs.

812
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,877
Now, let's test the venom.

813
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:46,791
The nature of the toxin and the amount
injected determine the effect of the bite.

814
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:49,992
And, of course, the place
where the subject is bitten.

815
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:52,918
It can lead to paralysis or death.

816
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:06,114
I'm no expert, but I'd guess this toxin
is fatal at a fraction of that dose.

817
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:07,832
I'd agree.

818
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:16,350
No sex organs.

819
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:19,156
That would make them drones.

820
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:22,311
Or soldiers.

821
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,754
That's typically seen in highly organised
insect societies-bees, ants -

822
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:29,952
but we've never seen it in spiders.

823
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:32,469
- I have.
- Venezuela, right?

824
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:35,115
Right. This is the descendant.

825
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:38,915
Somehow that South American male
has mated with a domestic house spider

826
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:41,235
and created a very deadly strain.

827
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:44,113
But if it has no sex organs,
it can't reproduce, right?

828
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:48,199
True, and the accelerated growth rate,
combined with the specialisation,

829
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:50,754
suggests a short life cycle.

830
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:53,075
We've already seen a dead one.

831
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:57,113
- That could be the good news.
- Now let's discuss the bad.

832
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:58,673
In their own ecosystem,

833
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:03,271
the species I discovered in South America
live at the top of the food chain.

834
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:08,918
The spread out from a central nest in a
web-like pattern and dominate the area.

835
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:13,750
But in their original habitat, geography
contains them. That isn't true here.

836
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:17,190
So the original male's
the grandaddy of them all.

837
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:21,393
And he's acting like a general
sending his troops to battle.

838
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:22,919
Excuse me.

839
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:25,869
Professor? This is our town exterminator.

840
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,709
McClintock, infestation management.
Always nice to meet a colleague.

841
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:33,435
He believes he came across one of the
offending spiders a couple of hours ago.

842
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:35,994
Might you have brought it with you?

843
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:39,237
Actually, he's probably still
on the bottom of my shoe.

844
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:43,196
You really can't tell what it is any more.

845
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:48,353
In this first generation,
the original male also produced a queen.

846
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:53,031
Together they will construct a primary nest,
which the queen will guard.

847
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:56,994
But eventually she will create
reproductive offspring of her own.

848
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:59,918
When that happens, this town is dead.

849
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:03,919
And the next town, and the next town.
And the next one and so on.

850
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:06,918
Irv owns the mortuary
where it must have originated.

851
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:10,350
- If we go in and destroy the original male...
- And the primary nest.

852
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:13,916
- I'll call the Department of Agriculture.
- There's phones in the office.

853
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:18,192
- I'll see you later at the mortuary.
- Sheriff, you'll give me a ride.

854
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:19,958
I am not a chauffeur.

855
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:22,036
- Shut up.
- Damn, it's busy!

856
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:25,436
Irv and Blaire always take the phone off
the hook during <i>Wheel Of Fortune.</i>

857
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:27,630
Let's get the hell over there.

858
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:50,958
Blaire, real butter or fake butter?

859
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:52,479
Fake.

860
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:59,557
- Irv, hurry.
- Buttery, hot and delicious!

861
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:18,236
He needs to buy a vowel.

862
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:26,157
Buy a vowel.

863
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:33,278
Delbert!

864
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:40,953
What's this nest?
What's it gonna look like?

865
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:46,551
You'd know it if you found it.
The area would be dark, warm, moist.

866
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:50,398
It'd be kind of a musty smell
and you'd probably see an egg sac.

867
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:52,715
Like your basic egg sac.

868
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:57,038
White, cocooned, pulsating,
about the size of a softball.

869
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:00,350
Of course, there'd be
no other spiders around.

870
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:01,993
What do you mean?

871
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:07,035
Spiders are cannibals, so she wouldn't
want any others near her offspring.

872
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:13,236
Yes, tell them exactly what I've told you.
Even if it is interrupting a dinner party.

873
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:14,839
Sheriff?

874
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:23,273
Where is this?

875
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:25,994
It's the old Daniels place.
Jennings bought it.

876
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:27,951
Take me there.

877
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:51,318
Hey, Irv!

878
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:53,913
Ross.

879
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:56,438
Canaima welcomes you.

880
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:59,870
Irv, we have an emergency!

881
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:20,238
I'll get us into the mortuary.

882
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:23,758
Ross!

883
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:53,958
We've found it.

884
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:01,992
Please go back to the mortuary and round
up my assistant and that exterminator.

885
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:04,509
All right, I'll do that.

886
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:08,553
Meanwhile, just stay here, sir, because
I'm not going to be responsible for...

887
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:10,033
Fine.

888
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:27,236
The killings have been so arbitrary.
Maybe there's more than one nest.

889
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:28,873
No, there's just that one.

890
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,353
What was it Atherton said?

891
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:33,313
They radiate out from a central nest.
You got a map of this town?

892
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:36,352
- Thinking about buying here?
- Just get a map, please.

893
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:38,395
Here.

894
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:40,670
The Kendalls' house.

895
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:42,995
Mark that down on there.

896
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:44,473
All-righty.

897
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:46,636
And the old guy, the doctor.

898
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:48,239
Metcalf.

899
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:50,749
- The football kid?
- Died behind the high school.

900
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:54,634
Right here. This is fun.
I found one at Beechwood's.

901
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:56,990
- The old lady, what was her name?
- Margaret.

902
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:59,315
- Is that all of them?
- Yeah, that's it.

903
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:01,829
This here in the centre,
that's the mortuary, right?

904
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:04,872
- No, that's a house.
- Who the hell lives there?

905
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:07,039
I do.

906
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:16,952
The whole time the nest was
in my own goddamn barn!

907
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:18,479
I doubt that, doc.

908
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:22,115
Your basic spider'd find your old barn
a tad breezy this time of year.

909
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:25,038
In that respect, spiders are
a bit like you and me.

910
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:27,355
I frankly doubt the nest is in the barn.

911
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:28,959
I frankly know it is.

912
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:30,638
I was in the barn. I saw a web.

913
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:32,557
There's a web in the barn.

914
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:35,069
A web would indicate
an arachnoid presence.

915
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:39,113
They got a saying,
I believe it's in the Benelux countries...

916
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:42,516
Just drive, Delbert.
Just drive and get us there, please.

917
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:03,720
My, you've been busy!

918
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:05,273
Incredible.

919
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:34,469
Supper's ready.

920
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:35,794
Come and get it.

921
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:54,151
I gotta get my family out.
Destroy whatever's in the barn.

922
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:57,431
Check. Better uncork my private stock.

923
01:23:57,560 --> 01:24:01,758
- Chris, there may be spiders in the house.
- They're probably... All right, let's go.

924
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:11,598
Give me a minute to look around out here
and then we go in, nice and easy, all right?

925
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:17,916
Hel-lo!

926
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:29,156
Trick or treat.

927
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:40,039
Gotcha!

928
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:46,750
Let's see what we got up here.

929
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:03,916
Oh, my God. They got the professor.

930
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,228
Honey?

931
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:13,351
- We're in here, Ross.
- Hi, Dad.

932
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:25,357
I expected you home for dinner.
I got worried, I called the office.

933
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:27,835
Sorry, I didn't get a chance to call.

934
01:25:39,680 --> 01:25:42,240
Okay, everyb...

935
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:58,471
Everybody just get up very slowly.

936
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:08,631
And walk towards the door.

937
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,036
Okay, quick and quiet.

938
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:17,355
We're gonna need another way out of here.

939
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:23,837
Upstairs, up into the bathroom.
We can climb out onto the roof.

940
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:29,871
Watch yourself, Ross.

941
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:33,279
Come on, Shelley.

942
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:40,150
Come on.

943
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:42,834
This doesn't make sense.
They're swarming.

944
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:45,315
I've never seen them this aggressive.

945
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:47,192
Hi, you guys, I'm Chris.

946
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:53,150
Put that under the door, quick!

947
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:01,231
Get it off me!

948
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:05,911
- Come on, Shelley.
- One at a time.

949
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,877
Down the trellis, honey.

950
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:14,471
Get out of there.

951
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:22,396
Ross, get out of there.

952
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:29,355
- Where's Ross?
- Right behind me.

953
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:30,708
Oh, no!

954
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,479
Shit!

955
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:41,951
Mom, spiders!

956
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,752
Shelley, Tommy, come here quick!

957
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:46,348
- Kids, come on.
- Get 'em away from the house.

958
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:55,676
Rock 'n' roll.

959
01:27:58,200 --> 01:28:00,270
All right, it's party time.

960
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:06,112
Take that!

961
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:11,436
What is it?
Musty smell, moist, dark, no spiders.

962
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:14,074
There's no spiders.

963
01:29:15,080 --> 01:29:17,992
It's dark, musty. The nest!

964
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:22,512
Nest. The queen.

965
01:29:25,640 --> 01:29:27,995
Shit, I'm in the goddamn nest!

966
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,830
Help!

967
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:37,713
Chris!

968
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:39,592
I found the nest!

969
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:41,915
And I saw the queen!

970
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:45,473
Shit!

971
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:41,192
Come on.

972
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:08,672
Therapy.

973
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:19,472
That's your basic egg sac.

974
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:33,352
Be right back.

975
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:30,312
Where is it?
That was the goddamn general!

976
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:34,597
Help!

977
01:33:17,320 --> 01:33:19,356
Not the ChÃ¢teau.

978
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:39,115
Goddamn it, where are you?

979
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:41,598
Damn it!

980
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:07,434
The itsy bitsy spider
climbed up the water spout

981
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:12,315
Down came the rain
and washed the spider out

982
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:20,591
Come on, come on.

983
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:57,478
Shit!

984
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:22,632
Nice shot.

985
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:26,833
Thank God.

986
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:30,359
Don't mention it.

987
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:47,315
It's okay. Everything's okay.

988
01:37:48,440 --> 01:37:50,908
- Oh, God, the spider...
- It's okay.

989
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:53,952
Most of them are dead.
The ones Delbert didn't get are dying.

990
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:57,311
- Where are the kids?
- The kids are fine. Everybody's okay.

991
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:13,795
# <i>I left my heart</i>

992
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:20,311
# <i>In San Francisco</i>

993
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:26,636
# <i>High on a hill</i>

994
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:30,234
You know what I'll miss most
about the country?

995
01:38:30,360 --> 01:38:33,272
- What?
- I don't know. That's why I'm asking you.

996
01:38:35,080 --> 01:38:37,071
At least we got out with our lives.

997
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:38,599
Yes.

998
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:42,191
And the Margaux.

999
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:47,112
To office politics, Christmas bonuses,

1000
01:38:47,240 --> 01:38:49,390
caffeine, adrenaline.

1001
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:53,115
To things that we know,
to events that we can control.

1002
01:38:53,240 --> 01:38:54,719
To...

1003
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:08,029
- Okay, that was a minor tremor.
- I barely felt it.

1004
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:10,310
Probably wouldn't even show up
on that scale.

1005
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:11,759
Richter scale.

1006
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:13,996
Just a cable car going by.

1007
01:39:14,120 --> 01:39:16,475
We should check the kids.
