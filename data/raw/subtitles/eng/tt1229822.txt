love or kindness.

180
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:56,973
You are loved.

181
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,604
There's an invisible world
all around you,

182
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,442
a kingdom of spirits
commissioned to
guard you, Jane.

183
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:09,986
Do you not see them?

184
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,454
Jane?

185
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,000
Have you something
for me to do?

186
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,128
You're doing
something already.

187
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:28,588
May I see?

188
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,932
These are wonderful.

189
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,271
St. John...

190
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:45,981
No, Mary, please...

191
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:49,151
See how skilled Jane is.

192
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:57,659
Is this how
you perceive me,
Miss Elliott?

193
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:05,751
Well. How fierce I am.

194
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,507
Jane.

195
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:17,637
You're freezing.
Your little feet are bare.

196
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:22,350
Come into bed
and cover yourself.

197
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:28,190

198
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,362

199
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,450
I'm happy, Jane.

200
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,036
I'm going home.

201
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,456
Back to your father?

202
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,585
I'm going to God.

203
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:54,007
Don't be sad.

204
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:57,052
You have a passion
for living, Jane.

205
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:02,098
And one day you'll
come to the region of bliss.

206
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:11,775
Don't leave me.

207
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:14,778
I like to have you near.

208
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,657
I will not leave you.

209
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:25,997

take me from you.

(CARRIAGE ROLLING AWAY)

215
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:31,396
Mr. Rivers? I wondered
if you had yet heard
of any work I could do.

216
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:34,649
I found you a situation
some time ago,

217
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:38,612
but I've delayed telling you
because the work is lowly
and I fear you'll scorn it.

218
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:40,864
I shan't mind what I do.

219
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,995
When I took over
the parish two years ago,
it had no school.

220
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,708
I opened one for boys.
I now intend to
open one for girls.

221
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,670
The schoolmistress
will have a cottage paid
for by benefactors

222
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,964
and she'll receive
£15 a year.

223
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:02,302
You can see how humble,
how ignoble it is.

224
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,304
Mr. Rivers,
thank you.

225
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,597
I accept.

226
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:07,849
With all my heart.

227
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:09,225
But you comprehend me?

229

with all your fine
accomplishments?

230
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:20,946
I will save them
till they're wanted.
They will keep.

232
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,032
You will be quite
alone here.

233
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:07,575
I'm not afraid
of solitude.

234
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,246
This is my first home
where I am neither dependent

235
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,664
nor subordinate to anyone.

236
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,709
Thank you, Mr. St. John.

237
00:22:19,422 --> 00:22:22,757
It is small and plain,
as I told you.

238
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,969
Then it'll suit me
very well.

(DOOR OPENING)

248
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:19,791
How do you do,
my dear?

249
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:22,502
Are you Mrs. Fairfax?
Indeed I am.

250
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:29,050
What a tedious journey
you must have had.

251
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:31,553
Your hands must
be frozen. Here.

252
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:39,060
Goodness.
How young you are.

253
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:41,354
I'm quite experienced,
I can assure you.

254
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:44,899
Of course you are.
I'm sure we're very
lucky to have you.

255
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,986
Leah, would you
ask Martha to bring
a little hot port

256
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,445
and cut a sandwich or two?

257
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,156
Draw nearer the fire.

258
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:54,367
John is taking your trunk
up to your room.

259
00:24:58,122 --> 00:25:00,415
I've put you at the
back of the house,
I hope you don't mind.

260
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,917
The rooms at the
front have much
finer furniture,

261
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:06,254
but they're so gloomy
and solitary, I think.

262
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,090
I'm glad you're come.

263
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:13,011
To be sure, this is
a grand old house,

264
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:17,056
but I must confess that
in winter one can feel
a little dreary and alone.

265
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:22,437
Leah's a very nice girl,
and John and Martha
are good people, too,

266
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:25,940
but they are servants.

267
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:28,484
One cannot talk to them
on terms of equality.

268
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:34,032
JANE: Am I meeting
Miss Fairfax tonight?

269
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:35,450
Who?

270
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,702
Miss Fairfax,
my pupil?

271
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:40,705
Oh, you mean Miss Varens,
Mr. Rochester's ward.

272
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,707
She's to be your pupil.

273
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,542
Who's Mr. Rochester?

274
00:25:45,336 --> 00:25:49,631
Why, the owner of Thornfield.
Mr. Edward Fairfax Rochester.

275
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:52,926
I thought Thornfield Hall
belonged to you.

276
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:56,346
Bless you, child,
what an idea. Me?

277
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,223
I'm only the housekeeper.

278
00:25:58,307 --> 00:25:59,641
Forgive me.

279
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:02,727
There is a distant
connection between
Mr. Rochester and me,

280
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:06,231
his mother was a Fairfax,
but I'd never presume on it.

281
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:09,150
Heavens. Me,
owner of Thornfield?

282
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:12,320
We shall have a cheerful
house this winter.

283
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:14,697
With Miss Varens
here and with you,

284
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:17,075
we'll have quite
a merry time of it.

285
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:21,037
I'm sure that last winter,
and what a severe one it was,
if it didn't rain it snowed,

286
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:23,081
if it didn't snow it blew.

287
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:27,752
I declare, not one soul
came to the house from
November to February.

288
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:32,090
When spring finally came,
I thought it a great relief
I hadn't gone distracted.

We must open the

00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:35,653
to let in some air.

00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:41,409
I've never seen such
an ancient old house.

How beautifully
you've preserved it.

299
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:47,206
Well, Mr. Rochester's visits
are always unexpected.

300
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:50,168
He doesn't like
to arrive and find
everything all swathed up,

301
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:52,754
so I keep it in
constant readiness.

302
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:56,549

meet Miss Varens.

have a tale of woe.
What's yours?

Mrs. Reed of Gateshead,

395

in a house even
finer than this.

396

as I could hope for.

not with Mrs. Reed
of Gateshead now?

Why?

405
00:37:15,317 --> 00:37:17,651

for sending us Miss Eyre.

Don't trouble yourself to
give her a character.
I'll judge for myself.

for this sprain.

Yes.

Yes, sir.

909
01:17:18,759 --> 01:17:22,220
I've a strange feeling
with regard to you,

910
01:17:22,388 --> 01:17:26,349
as if I had a string
somewhere under my left ribs,

911
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:29,394
tightly knotted to
a similar string in you.

912
01:17:29,937 --> 01:17:31,187
And if you were to leave,

913
01:17:31,272 --> 01:17:34,232
I'm afraid that
cord of communion
would snap.

914
01:17:36,569 --> 01:17:40,155
And I've a notion
that I'd take to
bleeding inwardly.

you'd forget me.

917
01:17:50,458 --> 01:17:52,917
I have lived
a full life here.

I have not been
trampled on.

I have not
been petrified.

920

I have not been
excluded from every
glimpse of what is bright.

921
01:18:00,259 --> 01:18:03,053
I have known you,
Mr. Rochester,

922
01:18:03,137 --> 01:18:06,431
and it strikes me
with anguish to be
torn from you.

923
01:18:06,849 --> 01:18:08,641
Then why must you leave?

924
01:18:08,768 --> 01:18:09,768
Because of your wife!

925
01:18:09,852 --> 01:18:10,935

And become
nothing to you?

929
01:18:19,070 --> 01:18:22,155
Am I a machine
without feelings?

930
01:18:22,281 --> 01:18:26,284
Do you think that
because I am poor,
obscure, plain and little

931
01:18:26,369 --> 01:18:29,371
that I am soulless
and heartless?

932
01:18:29,455 --> 01:18:31,748
I have as much soul as you
and full as much heart.

933
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:34,250
And if God had blessed me
with beauty and wealth,

934
01:18:34,335 --> 01:18:36,086
I could make it as hard
for you to leave me

935
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:38,755
as it is for I
to leave you.

936
01:18:39,465 --> 01:18:42,258
I'm not speaking to you
through mortal flesh.

937

It is my spirit that
addresses your spirit,

through the grave and stood
at God's feet, equal,

As we are.

I am a free human being
with an independent will,

to leave you.

01:30:54,407 --> 01:30:57,076
No. No!

1053
01:30:57,869 --> 01:31:00,246
Jane, do you love me?

1054
01:31:07,045 --> 01:31:09,130
Then the essential things
are the same.

1055
01:31:11,049 --> 01:31:12,299
Be my wife.

1056
01:31:13,510 --> 01:31:14,844
You have a wife.

1057
01:31:15,804 --> 01:31:18,556
I pledge you my
honor, my fidelity...

1058
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:19,640
You cannot.

1059
01:31:19,724 --> 01:31:21,892
...my love, until
death do us part.

1060
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:23,269
What of truth?

1061
01:31:24,437 --> 01:31:26,188
I would have
told you the truth.

1062
01:31:26,273 --> 01:31:28,190
You are deceitful, sir!

1063
01:31:33,238 --> 01:31:34,321
I was wrong
to deceive you.

1064
01:31:34,406 --> 01:31:37,032
I see that now.
It was cowardly.

1065
01:31:38,994 --> 01:31:41,579
I should have appealed
to your spirit as I do now.

1066
01:31:43,290 --> 01:31:46,125
Bertha Antoinetta Mason.

1067
01:31:46,376 --> 01:31:48,919
She was wanted by
my father for her fortune.

1068
01:31:50,172 --> 01:31:53,048
I hardly spoke with her
before the wedding.

1069
01:31:56,219 --> 01:31:58,596
I lived with her
for four years.

1070
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:02,266
Her temper ripened,
her vices sprang up,

1071
01:32:02,392 --> 01:32:04,727
violent and unchaste.

1072
01:32:04,853 --> 01:32:07,313
Only cruelty would check her,
and I'd not use cruelty.

1073
01:32:09,024 --> 01:32:11,275
I was chained to her
for life, Jane.

1074
01:32:12,235 --> 01:32:14,195
Not even the law
could free me.

1075
01:32:15,864 --> 01:32:17,615
Have you ever set foot
in a madhouse, Jane?

1076
01:32:17,699 --> 01:32:19,408
No, sir.

1077
01:32:19,618 --> 01:32:22,912
The inmates are caged
and baited like beasts.

1078
01:32:24,956 --> 01:32:27,082
I spared her
that at least.

1079
01:32:29,669 --> 01:32:30,669
Jane.

1080
01:32:30,754 --> 01:32:32,838
I earnestly pity you, sir.

1081
01:32:32,923 --> 01:32:33,923
No.

1082
01:32:35,217 --> 01:32:36,926
(BOTH CRYING)

1083
01:32:38,762 --> 01:32:41,096
Who would you offend
by living with me?

1084
01:32:42,015 --> 01:32:43,015
Who would care?

1085
01:32:43,099 --> 01:32:44,808
I would.

1086
01:32:45,852 --> 01:32:48,062
You'd rather drive
me to madness

1087
01:32:48,146 --> 01:32:50,773
than break some
mere human law?

1088
01:32:53,944 --> 01:32:55,361
I must respect myself.

1089
01:32:56,488 --> 01:32:57,488
Listen to me.

1090
01:32:59,449 --> 01:33:00,616
Listen.

1091
01:33:11,336 --> 01:33:15,089
I could bend you
with my finger
and my thumb,

1092
01:33:15,298 --> 01:33:17,967
a mere reed you feel
in my hands.

1093
01:33:26,851 --> 01:33:28,352
But whatever I do
with this cage,

1094
01:33:29,521 --> 01:33:32,064
I cannot get at you.

1095
01:33:32,649 --> 01:33:34,984
And it is your soul
that I want.

1096
01:33:39,030 --> 01:33:42,032
Why don't you come
of your own free will?

1097
01:33:43,952 --> 01:33:45,452
God help me!

1098
01:34:14,691 --> 01:34:16,233
(CRYING)

1099
01:34:47,891 --> 01:34:56,523
Jane!

1100
01:35:23,426 --> 01:35:24,968
(SOBBING)

1101
01:35:28,973 --> 01:35:30,140
(DISTANT THUNDER)

1102
01:36:10,974 --> 01:36:12,891
ST. JOHN:
I asked how you were.

1103
01:36:15,186 --> 01:36:16,645
I'm getting on very well.

1104
01:36:17,647 --> 01:36:19,648
Do you find the
work too hard?

1105
01:36:20,442 --> 01:36:22,067
Not at all.

1106
01:36:22,652 --> 01:36:25,237
Is the solitude
an oppression?

1107
01:36:25,321 --> 01:36:26,780
I hardly have time
to notice it.

1108
01:36:27,031 --> 01:36:28,240
Thank you, girls.

1109
01:36:28,324 --> 01:36:29,575
BOTH: Yes, ma'am.

1110
01:36:33,371 --> 01:36:35,164
Then perhaps
you are dwelling
on things past.

1111
01:36:37,625 --> 01:36:39,918
When I came to your door,
I had nothing.

1112
01:36:41,045 --> 01:36:43,922
Now I have a home and work,
free and honest.

1113
01:36:44,048 --> 01:36:47,301
I thank God
for the generosity
of my friends.

1114
01:36:49,762 --> 01:36:53,056
What you had left
before I met you,
I don't know.

1115
01:36:53,725 --> 01:36:55,559
But I counsel you
to resist firmly

1116
01:36:55,643 --> 01:36:57,978
every temptation
to look back.

1117
01:36:58,855 --> 01:37:00,814
That's what I intend to do.

1118
01:37:00,899 --> 01:37:04,401
A year ago, I was myself
intensely miserable.

1119
01:37:04,486 --> 01:37:06,904
I scorned this weakness,

1120
01:37:07,572 --> 01:37:09,990
fought hard against it
and won.

1121
01:37:16,331 --> 01:37:19,041
I wonder if we
do not share
the same alloy.

1122
01:37:19,918 --> 01:37:22,044
You are ambitious,
I think.

1123
01:37:22,754 --> 01:37:25,422
And this little school
will not hold you for long.

1124
01:37:32,889 --> 01:37:33,847
Is this yours?

1125
01:37:33,932 --> 01:37:35,140
Yes.

1126
01:37:37,602 --> 01:37:39,269
What's the matter?

1127
01:37:39,979 --> 01:37:40,979
Nothing.

1128
01:37:43,608 --> 01:37:45,025
Good night.

1129
01:38:06,130 --> 01:38:08,340
(BANGING ON DOOR)

1130
01:38:27,652 --> 01:38:29,528
Jane.

1131
01:38:44,168 --> 01:38:46,211
Miss Eyre.

1132
01:38:52,343 --> 01:38:55,012
What brings you
from your hearth
on a night like this?

1133
01:38:55,096 --> 01:38:56,346
There is no bad
news, I hope.

1134
01:38:56,472 --> 01:39:00,058
How easily alarmed
you are, Miss Eyre.

1135
01:39:01,519 --> 01:39:03,312
Please, won't
you sit down?

1136
01:39:03,396 --> 01:39:05,355
Thank you, Miss Eyre.

1137
01:39:11,237 --> 01:39:15,490
I saw an advertisement
in The Times from
a solicitor named Briggs

1138
01:39:15,617 --> 01:39:17,618
inquiring of a Jane Eyre.

1139
01:39:18,703 --> 01:39:20,203
I knew a Jane Elliott.

1140
01:39:21,789 --> 01:39:24,875
This paper
resolved my suspicion
into certainty.

1141
01:39:27,420 --> 01:39:29,296
And so, I wrote to him.

1142
01:39:30,256 --> 01:39:32,090
He told the story of
a young governess.

1143
01:39:33,426 --> 01:39:35,636
And her employer,
a Mr. Fairfax Rochester...

1144
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:37,554
Mr. Rivers.

1145
01:39:40,725 --> 01:39:42,684
I can guess your feelings,
but please hear me.

1146
01:39:46,397 --> 01:39:49,066
As you know so much,
perhaps you'll tell
me how he is?

1147
01:39:49,233 --> 01:39:51,151
Who?
Mr. Rochester.

1148
01:39:51,736 --> 01:39:53,362
I'm ignorant of
all concerning him.

1149
01:39:55,073 --> 01:39:56,907
But he has
been seeking me?

1150
01:39:57,075 --> 01:39:59,910
No, he hasn't.

1151
01:40:00,745 --> 01:40:03,163
Mr. Briggs has.

1152
01:40:04,248 --> 01:40:05,707
And what does
he want with me?

1153
01:40:06,417 --> 01:40:09,044
Merely to tell you
that your uncle,

1154
01:40:09,128 --> 01:40:12,339
Mr. John Eyre of
Madeira, is dead,

1155
01:40:12,423 --> 01:40:15,175
that he has left you
all his property

1156
01:40:15,259 --> 01:40:16,718
and that you
are now rich.

1157
01:40:18,721 --> 01:40:20,263
What?

1158
01:40:20,348 --> 01:40:21,932
You are rich,

1159
01:40:22,642 --> 01:40:24,267
quite an heiress.

1160
01:40:26,896 --> 01:40:28,313
Will you ask how
much you are worth?

1161
01:40:29,732 --> 01:40:31,358
How much am I worth?

1162
01:40:31,984 --> 01:40:33,902
Twenty thousand pounds.

1163
01:40:35,321 --> 01:40:37,030
(LAUGHING)

1164
01:40:37,115 --> 01:40:38,573
If you had committed
a murder

1165
01:40:38,658 --> 01:40:41,243
and I'd found you out,
you could scarcely
look more aghast.

1166
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:43,870
There must be
some mistake.

1167
01:40:43,955 --> 01:40:45,372
Not at all.

1168
01:40:48,126 --> 01:40:50,877
You look desperately
miserable about it,
I must say.

1169
01:40:53,214 --> 01:40:54,464
Please,

1170
01:40:55,925 --> 01:40:58,552
sit down.
I've shocked you.

1171
01:41:20,158 --> 01:41:22,159
Mr. St. John.

1172
01:41:22,326 --> 01:41:24,161
The debt I owe to you
and your sisters...

1173
01:41:24,245 --> 01:41:25,662
Is nothing.

1174
01:41:27,457 --> 01:41:29,124
You saved my life.

1175
01:41:32,670 --> 01:41:34,463
Please write to them.

1176
01:41:34,547 --> 01:41:36,548
This money frees us.

1177
01:41:36,674 --> 01:41:37,883
They will have 5,000 each,

1178
01:41:37,967 --> 01:41:39,301
and so will you,
if you'll take it.

1179
01:41:39,385 --> 01:41:40,427
Certainly not.

1180
01:41:40,511 --> 01:41:41,762
And if you would accept
me as a sister,

1181
01:41:41,846 --> 01:41:42,971
perhaps we could
live together,

1182
01:41:43,055 --> 01:41:44,097
at Moor House.

1183
01:41:44,182 --> 01:41:45,932
I told you the
news too quickly.

1184
01:41:46,768 --> 01:41:48,351
You're confused.

1185
01:41:48,436 --> 01:41:50,187
My only relative is dead.

1186
01:41:50,938 --> 01:41:52,731
You have family.

1187
01:41:52,857 --> 01:41:54,649
You cannot know
what isolation means.

1188
01:41:54,734 --> 01:41:56,860
And you cannot know
what it means
to be wealthy.

1189
01:41:56,986 --> 01:41:59,404
I have been alone always.

1190
01:41:59,530 --> 01:42:01,490
I've never had
a brother or sisters.

1191
01:42:01,574 --> 01:42:02,741
Please, let me be yours.

1192
01:42:09,749 --> 01:42:11,958
Are you reluctant
to have me?

1193
01:42:12,168 --> 01:42:13,335
No, Miss Eyre.

1194
01:42:14,378 --> 01:42:16,171
On the contrary.

1195
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:18,089
I shall write
to my sisters,
as you request.

1196
01:42:19,592 --> 01:42:20,926
Brother.

1197
01:42:28,267 --> 01:42:31,269
ST. JOHN:
We are bid to work
while it is day.

1198
01:42:32,730 --> 01:42:35,482
For night cometh,
when no man shall work.

1199
01:42:37,068 --> 01:42:39,319
Help us to choose
the harder path,

1200
01:42:40,404 --> 01:42:42,239
for as our master
is long-suffering,

1201
01:42:43,533 --> 01:42:45,534
so must we be.

1202
01:42:47,912 --> 01:42:48,995
Amen.

1203
01:42:49,413 --> 01:42:50,872
Amen.
Amen.

1204
01:42:55,002 --> 01:43:00,090
Good night.
Good night.

1205
01:43:01,676 --> 01:43:03,093
Good night.

1206
01:43:04,387 --> 01:43:06,263
Is Jane not
our sister, too?

1207
01:43:16,107 --> 01:43:18,191
Good night.

1208
01:43:27,952 --> 01:43:29,202
ST. JOHN:
(WHISPERING) Jane.

1209
01:43:29,287 --> 01:43:31,288
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

1210
01:43:36,377 --> 01:43:38,336
I go to India
in six weeks.

1211
01:43:40,631 --> 01:43:42,841
I can see what
your gifts are

1212
01:43:42,967 --> 01:43:44,134
and why they were given.

1213
01:43:45,344 --> 01:43:49,055
God intended you
for a missionary's wife.

1214
01:43:51,767 --> 01:43:53,518
I want to claim you.

1215
01:43:55,104 --> 01:43:56,605
I'm not fit for it.

1216
01:43:58,608 --> 01:44:00,609
I trust you
unreservedly.

1217
01:44:02,069 --> 01:44:03,236
And know this,

1218
01:44:04,614 --> 01:44:05,614
in you,

1219
01:44:06,699 --> 01:44:09,284
I recognize
a fellow soul.

1220
01:45:18,729 --> 01:45:20,188
I'll go with you
to India.

1221
01:45:21,315 --> 01:45:22,357
Jane.

1222
01:45:22,441 --> 01:45:24,025
I'll go if
I may go free.

1223
01:45:25,236 --> 01:45:26,319
Free?

1224
01:45:28,656 --> 01:45:31,449
How can I take out
to India a girl of 19
unless she is my wife?

1225
01:45:31,951 --> 01:45:34,327
I love you as a brother.
As a husband, no.

1226
01:45:35,121 --> 01:45:37,539
My heart is mute.

1227
01:45:38,582 --> 01:45:40,583
Then I must speak for it.

1228
01:45:41,293 --> 01:45:43,253
You've said you'll come.

1229
01:45:43,337 --> 01:45:45,005
We shall marry.

1230
01:45:45,089 --> 01:45:47,632
And undoubtedly
enough of love
would follow.

1231
01:45:51,470 --> 01:45:52,554
Enough of love?

1232
01:45:54,098 --> 01:45:55,098
Yes, quite enough.

1233
01:45:55,891 --> 01:45:57,100
Of love?

1234
01:45:57,601 --> 01:45:59,936
Yes. In all its forms.

1235
01:46:00,688 --> 01:46:02,856
Forgive me, but
the very name of love

1236
01:46:02,940 --> 01:46:05,817
is an apple of discord
between us.

1237
01:46:05,943 --> 01:46:08,862
My dear brother,
abandon your
scheme of marriage.

1238
01:46:08,946 --> 01:46:10,780
Why this refusal?

1239
01:46:11,449 --> 01:46:12,949
It makes no sense.

1240
01:46:13,034 --> 01:46:15,035
I earnestly wish
to be your friend.

1241
01:46:15,119 --> 01:46:17,412
You can't give
half a sacrifice.

1242
01:46:19,123 --> 01:46:20,290
You must give all.

1243
01:46:20,374 --> 01:46:22,542
To marry you
would kill me!

1244
01:46:22,668 --> 01:46:27,839
Kill you?

1245
01:46:29,258 --> 01:46:31,843
Those words are
unfeminine and untrue.

1246
01:46:35,639 --> 01:46:37,807
I know where your heart turns
and to what it still clings.

1247
01:46:41,687 --> 01:46:42,896
Say his name.

1248
01:46:46,650 --> 01:46:47,817
Say it. Say it!

1249
01:46:48,986 --> 01:46:50,904
ROCHESTER: Jane.

1250
01:46:50,988 --> 01:46:53,740
Why have you not
yet crushed this
lawless passion?

1251
01:46:56,952 --> 01:46:57,994
Jane!

1252
01:46:59,413 --> 01:47:00,914
It offends me and
it offends God!

1253
01:47:01,332 --> 01:47:02,707
What is it?

1254
01:47:03,709 --> 01:47:05,168
Where are you?

1255
01:47:07,296 --> 01:47:08,296
Wait for me.

1256
01:47:08,714 --> 01:47:10,715
Why do you speak to the air?

1257
01:47:13,177 --> 01:47:14,177
Jane.

1258
01:47:14,553 --> 01:47:15,553
ROCHESTER: Jane.

1259
01:47:17,681 --> 01:47:19,516
I am coming!
Jane!

1260
01:47:55,719 --> 01:47:57,428
Wait, please, Miss.

1261
01:49:15,799 --> 01:49:17,258
(WOOD CREAKING)

1262
01:49:39,365 --> 01:49:40,365
Jane Eyre.

1263
01:49:42,534 --> 01:49:44,661
I thought
gypsies were come.

1264
01:49:45,621 --> 01:49:48,623
And then I saw you,
and I thought,
it cannot be,

1265
01:49:48,749 --> 01:49:50,333
you are a ghost.

1266
01:49:53,295 --> 01:49:55,421
No one knows
how it started.

1267
01:49:56,840 --> 01:50:00,885
I expect that Mrs. Poole
took too much of
the gin and water,

1268
01:50:01,011 --> 01:50:02,845
and as she slept,
the lady,

1269
01:50:02,930 --> 01:50:05,598
Mrs. Rochester,
unhooked the keys.

1270
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:08,351
She did what she failed
to do a year ago,

1271
01:50:08,435 --> 01:50:10,812
set the whole place
to fire.

1272
01:50:13,565 --> 01:50:15,608
We would have
all perished
in the smoke,

1273
01:50:15,693 --> 01:50:19,153
but Mr. Rochester
would not rest till
we were all safe.

1274
01:50:20,072 --> 01:50:22,282
Then he went
in for her.

1275
01:50:23,534 --> 01:50:25,285
The flames were
tearing up so high

1276
01:50:25,369 --> 01:50:27,745
it brought men running
from the village.

1277
01:50:28,414 --> 01:50:30,665
I saw her standing
on the roof.

1278
01:50:30,749 --> 01:50:31,791
The very edge.

1279
01:50:32,418 --> 01:50:34,961
I heard Mr. Rochester
beg her to come down.

1280
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:38,256
But she jumped.

1281
01:50:40,342 --> 01:50:41,551
Mr. Rochester remained,

1282
01:50:41,635 --> 01:50:45,138
as if he would not move
until the fire consumed him.

1283
01:50:47,391 --> 01:50:48,850
I didn't know.

1284
01:50:50,227 --> 01:50:52,687
I didn't know
it was his wife,
I promise you.

1285
01:50:54,231 --> 01:50:56,149
Why did you
run away, child?

1286
01:50:57,151 --> 01:50:59,110
I would have helped you.

1287
01:50:59,737 --> 01:51:01,946
I had some money saved.

1288
01:51:02,114 --> 01:51:03,698
You could have come to me.

1289
01:51:08,245 --> 01:51:09,746
Where is he?

1290
01:51:50,704 --> 01:51:51,871
(WHINING)

1291
01:51:51,955 --> 01:51:53,122
Pilot.

1292
01:52:08,430 --> 01:52:09,430
Who's there?

1293
01:52:35,833 --> 01:52:37,834
This hand...

1294
01:52:55,769 --> 01:53:02,108
Jane Eyre.

1295
01:53:06,655 --> 01:53:08,698
Edward, I am
come back to you.

1296
01:53:21,170 --> 01:53:24,046
Fairfax Rochester
with nothing to say?

1297
01:53:28,802 --> 01:53:30,720
You are altogether
a human being, Jane.

1298
01:53:33,765 --> 01:53:35,975
I conscientiously
believe so.

1299
01:53:52,868 --> 01:53:54,744
A dream.

1300
01:54:00,667 --> 01:54:02,084
Awaken then.

1301
01:54:13,222 --> 01:54:14,889
