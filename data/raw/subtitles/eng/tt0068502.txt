1
00:01:57,249 --> 00:02:01,417
<i>At the end of the next long street</i>

2
00:02:01,673 --> 00:02:03,728
<i>He'll be there</i>

3
00:02:04,311 --> 00:02:07,628
<i>Around the next-up corner</i>

4
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:09,645
<i>Waiting there</i>

5
00:02:09,809 --> 00:02:11,770
<i>For me</i>

6
00:02:12,645 --> 00:02:17,247
<i>I'll keep searching, looking,
waiting, hoping</i>

7
00:02:17,248 --> 00:02:19,341
<i>He'll be there</i>

8
00:02:19,662 --> 00:02:22,623
<i>A boy for me</i>

9
00:02:23,231 --> 00:02:26,463
<i>That's how it's got to be</i>

10
00:02:27,207 --> 00:02:30,714
<i>And that's how it's got to be</i>

11
00:02:30,715 --> 00:02:32,859
<i>For me</i>

12
00:02:41,932 --> 00:02:45,964
Here! Marie! If you find your gent,
charge him half a crown.

13
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:49,870
Tell him it's gone up.
Tell him everything's going up!

14
00:02:49,871 --> 00:02:51,538
See you tomorrow!

15
00:04:28,785 --> 00:04:30,616
This way! Here!

16
00:04:30,617 --> 00:04:32,298
Over here!

17
00:05:21,222 --> 00:05:25,743
<i>This is the testament of Dr. Henry Jekyll.
Age 30, male.</i>

18
00:05:26,777 --> 00:05:28,374
<i>Male...</i>

19
00:05:29,055 --> 00:05:30,722
<i>Male!</i>

20
00:05:30,723 --> 00:05:33,847
<i>I must set this down before it is too late.</i>

21
00:05:34,623 --> 00:05:37,064
<i>It all began on the November last...</i>

22
00:05:37,065 --> 00:05:41,770
<i>That grey and fateful day when I was
visited by my dearest friend and colleague,</i>

23
00:05:41,771 --> 00:05:43,745
<i>professor Robertson.</i>

24
00:05:44,223 --> 00:05:45,936
Oh!

25
00:05:45,937 --> 00:05:48,451
- Allow me.
- That's very kind of you.

26
00:05:50,585 --> 00:05:53,715
It's my pleasure.
Er... Which way?

27
00:05:53,716 --> 00:05:56,850
- Oh, please don't bother.
I'm going to that house over there.

28
00:05:59,988 --> 00:06:03,168
By a happy coincidence!
So am I.

29
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:10,395
Robertson, professor Robertson.

30
00:06:10,396 --> 00:06:13,026
How do you do? I'm Susan Spencer.

31
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,831
And this is my brother, Howard.

32
00:06:15,832 --> 00:06:17,717
How do you do?

33
00:06:18,485 --> 00:06:21,176
This gentleman has kindly assisted me.

34
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:24,635
- Most kind... but, we can
manage from here.

35
00:06:33,178 --> 00:06:35,484
Well, you said you could manage.

36
00:06:40,489 --> 00:06:41,613
Thank you.

37
00:06:41,892 --> 00:06:45,031
My dear Doctor Jekyll,
you work yourself far too hard.

38
00:06:45,752 --> 00:06:48,911
Only last night I passed here,
well after midnight,

39
00:06:48,912 --> 00:06:50,717
and your light was still burning.

40
00:06:51,422 --> 00:06:53,258
I was working.

41
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:57,523
What were you doing at that hour?
- No, I was on the job too.

42
00:06:57,524 --> 00:06:59,313
Research, you know?

43
00:06:59,784 --> 00:07:03,325
Delicious blonde fragment from
the chorus of the Alhambra.

44
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:05,703
Come now, professor. Research?

45
00:07:05,704 --> 00:07:09,509
- Oh! Certainly a great benefit
to mankind.

46
00:07:09,928 --> 00:07:11,094
Well...

47
00:07:11,095 --> 00:07:13,199
To a small section of it, at any rate.

48
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,615
- And what will you have to show for it?
The pox?

49
00:07:16,933 --> 00:07:18,948
I sincerely hope not.

50
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:22,252
Well, if you do, perhaps my researches will help you.

51
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,942
Antivirus.

52
00:07:25,943 --> 00:07:28,323
The universal panacea.

53
00:07:28,324 --> 00:07:31,579
One virus to combat perhaps 20 diseases.

54
00:07:31,748 --> 00:07:33,855
How far have you got?

55
00:07:33,856 --> 00:07:36,999
- Oh, not far...
I admit it's early days, naturally...

56
00:07:37,272 --> 00:07:41,565
But, I have produced a virus strain which will
provide some immunity against diptheria.

57
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,727
And when that's perfected,
I'll tackle another disease.

58
00:07:45,172 --> 00:07:47,013
Cholera, perhaps...

59
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:50,760
Robertson?

60
00:07:51,812 --> 00:07:54,563
Ah... Yes! Yes, very commendable.

61
00:07:54,564 --> 00:07:57,996
You seem to be acquiring a very
interesting new neighbour.

62
00:07:58,181 --> 00:07:59,874
Professor...

63
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:04,481
- Though, I was listening...
My eyes were diverted but my ears were yours.

64
00:08:05,107 --> 00:08:08,059
So... An antivirus?

65
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:11,052
To protect us against a myriad of diseases.

66
00:08:11,338 --> 00:08:14,521
Now, tell me... Just how long
before you expect some results?

67
00:08:14,522 --> 00:08:18,789
- Well, I hope to provided more complete immunity
against diphtheria, within a year or two.

68
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,292
A year or two?

69
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:23,491
And then, what? Cholera?

70
00:08:23,492 --> 00:08:26,042
- Yes.
- Another year or two...

71
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:29,078
And then, typhus...
Another year or two...

72
00:08:29,672 --> 00:08:33,020
And then, typhoid, and influenza.
And yellow fever...

73
00:08:33,021 --> 00:08:35,897
Oh, my dear Jekyll,
at that rate it will be forty or fifty eaten

74
00:08:35,898 --> 00:08:37,737
before you've completed the experiment.

75
00:08:37,738 --> 00:08:40,462
- Oh, it's a long process, I agree...
But, the point is...

76
00:08:40,463 --> 00:08:43,678
- Point is you'll be dead and burried
long before it's finished.

77
00:08:43,846 --> 00:08:48,365
<i>A chance remark from Robertson
that sparked off this whole evil affair.</i>

78
00:08:48,622 --> 00:08:51,721
<i>A remark remained and festered in my mind.</i>

79
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,783
<i>I had no mind, no will for work.</i>

80
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:57,855
<i>I walked the streets brooding upon the bitter irony</i>

81
00:08:57,892 --> 00:09:00,644
<i>that all I wanted to do for humanity, for life...</i>

82
00:09:00,776 --> 00:09:02,878
<i>Would be cheated by death.</i>

83
00:09:03,225 --> 00:09:05,811
<i>Unless, I could cheat death.</i>

84
00:09:07,344 --> 00:09:09,958
<i>The thought took shape in my mind.</i>

85
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:12,884
<i>Suddenly, it was clear to me what I must do.</i>

86
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:15,695
<i>I decided to explore a new avenue...</i>

87
00:09:16,963 --> 00:09:19,462
<i>An elixir of life.</i>

88
00:09:20,048 --> 00:09:22,265
<i>The secret of eternal youth.</i>

89
00:09:23,017 --> 00:09:26,393
<i>A secret that had fascinated
and eluded men for centuries.</i>

90
00:09:27,035 --> 00:09:31,007
<i>But, they have sought it through witchery,
black magic and superstitious nonsense...</i>

91
00:09:31,824 --> 00:09:35,001
<i>But I had science at my fingertips.</i>

92
00:09:36,359 --> 00:09:40,985
<i>I saw it as the first step in an
exciting scientific adventure.</i>

93
00:09:41,151 --> 00:09:45,437
<i>I could not know then that it was
the first step towards the black abbyss,</i>

94
00:09:45,506 --> 00:09:49,458
<i>towards a myriad of horrors, towards self-destruction.</i>

95
00:09:49,761 --> 00:09:52,455
<i>I was seized and engulfed by the idea.</i>

96
00:09:52,584 --> 00:09:55,321
<i>It became my passion and my obsession.</i>

97
00:09:55,322 --> 00:09:57,378
<i>I worked without stop.</i>

98
00:09:57,379 --> 00:10:00,876
<i>Days and night passed without meaning for me.</i>

99
00:10:01,386 --> 00:10:04,689
<i>I was utterly heedless of the outside world.</i>

100
00:10:11,941 --> 00:10:15,776
What is it so fascinates you
outside that window, Susan?

101
00:10:16,937 --> 00:10:19,846
Susan, your brother is talking to you.

102
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:23,499
- I was wondering what you were looking at.
- Nothing.

103
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,290
Or at least, nothing yet.

104
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,010
- A riddle, this must be a riddle.
- Sorry...

105
00:10:28,011 --> 00:10:30,595
What I actually meant was,
I haven't seen Doctor Jekyll.

106
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:33,400
- You mean the young man
who lives below us?

107
00:10:33,401 --> 00:10:36,675
Oh, why should you have seen him?
- No reason.

108
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:40,735
It's just that I'm sure he hasn't been
out of his rooms in past five days.

109
00:10:40,736 --> 00:10:43,139
Why should that concern my little sister?

110
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,885
It seems odd, don't you think?

111
00:10:44,886 --> 00:10:48,959
- Why, I think he's remarkably dilligent.
And that's Doctor Jekyll's reputation.

112
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,314
He's a dedicated man.
A good man.

113
00:10:51,315 --> 00:10:53,418
There he goes. - Where?

114
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:56,131
There. You see?

115
00:10:56,461 --> 00:10:59,349
There's your precious Doctor Jekyll.

116
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,518
What do you think of him now, mamma?

117
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:07,563
Where can he be going at this ungodly hour?

118
00:11:08,554 --> 00:11:11,331
Hope you're not going to chose her...

119
00:11:12,494 --> 00:11:14,615
I'm kind of fond of her...

120
00:11:22,698 --> 00:11:24,437
This one.

121
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:29,978
There's no accounting for taste, is there?

122
00:11:36,611 --> 00:11:39,974
Oh, I'll be outside then,
if you want me. And, uh...

123
00:11:40,614 --> 00:11:42,547
Just call.

124
00:11:43,616 --> 00:11:45,477
I'll know it's you.

125
00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:50,316
Hot potatoes!

126
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:53,530
'Er you are gov. Don't burn yourself. Lovely or not.

127
00:11:56,111 --> 00:11:57,816
Hot potatoes!

128
00:11:58,167 --> 00:12:00,121
Lovely hot potatoes!

129
00:12:36,953 --> 00:12:38,766
Barry's, wine, merchants!

130
00:13:20,941 --> 00:13:24,336
Handsome? Never! I don't believe it.
- I tell you he is.

131
00:13:24,573 --> 00:13:26,346
Handsome!

132
00:13:27,038 --> 00:13:28,909
A fine face.

133
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:31,887
But, so tired...

134
00:13:32,477 --> 00:13:34,271
So very tired.

135
00:13:35,085 --> 00:13:37,509
And young too, he's much younger
than I imagined.

136
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:41,057
- Our sinister Doctor Jekyll?
- There's nothing sinister about him at all. Nothing!

137
00:13:41,162 --> 00:13:44,841
- Of course, there isn't.
Howard, you mustn't tease her so.

138
00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:48,945
I've met Doctor Jekyll myself, I should
think he's rather a nice young man.

139
00:15:02,138 --> 00:15:03,665
<i>At last!</i>

140
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:04,822
At last!
- Come in.

141
00:15:08,034 --> 00:15:09,651
What time is it?

142
00:15:09,652 --> 00:15:12,150
- Well, don't mind the time.
What have you been up to?

143
00:15:12,153 --> 00:15:14,867
I've been trying to get to see you since Wednesday.

144
00:15:14,868 --> 00:15:18,286
I knew you were here.
There's no use denying it. - Wednesday?

145
00:15:18,504 --> 00:15:21,235
Did you say Wednesday?

146
00:15:21,948 --> 00:15:23,934
What day is it now?

147
00:15:23,935 --> 00:15:27,470
- Saturday, of course.
Really, my dear chap. You must try...

148
00:15:27,663 --> 00:15:29,226
Saturday?

149
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:33,002
I've been asleep... three days.

150
00:15:33,816 --> 00:15:35,574
I don't wonder at it.

151
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:39,079
What I can make out,
you worked without stop for ten days.

152
00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:40,989
Three days!

153
00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:44,388
Three days!
- You can't go on like this, you know.

154
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:46,910
Get some air!
Get some food inside you.

155
00:15:47,675 --> 00:15:50,785
Yes, yes... I will, dear Robertson.

156
00:15:51,449 --> 00:15:54,097
I'm going to show you this. Here.

157
00:15:56,172 --> 00:15:58,219
Do you recognize this species?

158
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,599
Of course.

159
00:16:00,935 --> 00:16:03,458
What's it's life cycle?

160
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:05,407
A few hours, no more.

161
00:16:05,409 --> 00:16:09,704
- Robertson, this insect, which normally
dies within an hour or two of it's birth...

162
00:16:09,705 --> 00:16:12,750
... has been alive for three whole days.

163
00:16:12,751 --> 00:16:17,029
How long would that be in human terms?
Three days, that's 72 hours.

164
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:21,141
By human terms, this insect is already
more than two hundred years old.

165
00:16:22,026 --> 00:16:25,445
Just what line of research are you following?

166
00:16:26,613 --> 00:16:28,661
An elixir of life...

167
00:16:29,914 --> 00:16:32,689
- That old one?
- Nature's elixir.

168
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:35,528
Hormones. Female hormones.

169
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:41,454
What is it that gives a woman's skin that silk in texture?
Why does she keep her hair when so many men lose theirs?

170
00:16:41,455 --> 00:16:43,844
Hormones! Female hormones!

171
00:16:44,565 --> 00:16:48,245
- Yes, I have heard the theory.
- No longer a theory, professor, fact.

172
00:16:48,246 --> 00:16:50,322
See for yourself!

173
00:16:51,242 --> 00:16:52,780
Here.

174
00:16:57,524 --> 00:16:59,917
Yes, it is remarkable.

175
00:17:00,171 --> 00:17:01,661
I wonder...

176
00:17:01,662 --> 00:17:04,216
... how it would work on a male?

177
00:17:04,217 --> 00:17:06,531
You can see I used a male.

178
00:17:07,002 --> 00:17:08,871
Sorry, old man...

179
00:17:08,872 --> 00:17:12,941
My due, it's an easy enough mistake to make.
Something as small as this.

180
00:17:12,942 --> 00:17:14,973
This insect is male!

181
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:18,465
Then, who laid these eggs here?

182
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:24,846
You've made a mistake, old chap.

183
00:17:26,704 --> 00:17:29,156
Anyway... What happens next?

184
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,341
Next?

185
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:34,975
- You've increased the life-span of an insect, --
where does that lead?

186
00:17:36,674 --> 00:17:39,027
I don't know yet. I am...

187
00:17:39,352 --> 00:17:41,103
I'm not sure.

188
00:17:43,511 --> 00:17:46,059
It's just not possible, Doctor.

189
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:49,355
You've claimed me out. I haven't got
an unlimited supply, you know.

190
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,981
It's important to me, Byker.

191
00:17:53,443 --> 00:17:55,237
Very important.

192
00:17:57,152 --> 00:17:58,963
Well, perhaps, eh...

193
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,158
... there is an alternative.

194
00:18:04,389 --> 00:18:08,698
But, it would have to be...
quietly done, you understand.

195
00:18:09,286 --> 00:18:10,898
Quietly done.

196
00:18:10,899 --> 00:18:13,776
It will be just between you and me, Byker.

197
00:18:13,777 --> 00:18:16,808
Can you arrange it?
- I'll see what I can do.

198
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:19,280
It's a couple of fellows,...

199
00:18:19,281 --> 00:18:21,975
... name of Burke and Hare.

200
00:18:22,774 --> 00:18:26,061
<i>They're in the the trade, so to speak.
I'll see what they can do.</i>

201
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:30,803
- It must be female, no more
than twenty years old.

202
00:18:32,182 --> 00:18:34,276
Oh, I shan't forget.

203
00:18:34,743 --> 00:18:37,515
That's exactly how I like them.

204
00:18:46,863 --> 00:18:48,781
It's alright, isn't it?

205
00:18:48,782 --> 00:18:51,140
I mean, she has been pretty, hasn't she?

206
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,462
Except, where the cart wheel went over her.

207
00:18:55,043 --> 00:18:56,980
Wait in there.

208
00:18:59,228 --> 00:19:01,474
You'll find a good brandy.

209
00:19:07,301 --> 00:19:10,085
What do you think he needs 'em for?
- Eh?

210
00:19:10,087 --> 00:19:12,965
- What do you think he does with them?
- I don't know.

211
00:19:12,966 --> 00:19:17,108
But, if I was you, I wouldn't eat
any meat pies in this neighborhood.

212
00:19:18,676 --> 00:19:21,661
- Alright.
- You've done already?

213
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,945
Take it away.

214
00:19:37,063 --> 00:19:39,522
Get it away from here now.

215
00:19:43,209 --> 00:19:46,147
What about the others?
- Others?

216
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:49,006
- Yes, I shall need more.
As many as you can get.

217
00:19:49,007 --> 00:19:50,725
Others?

218
00:19:52,686 --> 00:19:55,046
Might cost you a little more.

219
00:19:55,047 --> 00:19:57,046
You'll be paid.

220
00:19:57,082 --> 00:20:00,182
Then I think we can supply your needs.

221
00:20:00,183 --> 00:20:02,504
Yes, I think we can do that.

222
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,260
We'll be in touch.

223
00:20:09,903 --> 00:20:13,842
<i>And that's how it's going to be</i>

224
00:20:14,374 --> 00:20:18,343
<i>That's how it's going to be</i>

225
00:20:18,516 --> 00:20:20,315
<i>For me</i>

226
00:20:20,614 --> 00:20:22,204
Watch out for these lasses.

227
00:20:22,205 --> 00:20:24,356
Keep your hands to yourself!

228
00:20:42,228 --> 00:20:44,918
The good doctor keeps an excellent cigar.

229
00:20:45,476 --> 00:20:49,660
They're onto a very good thing all-around, my friend.
A very good thing.

230
00:20:49,661 --> 00:20:51,424
What do you mean?

231
00:20:51,425 --> 00:20:54,416
Well, he only mucks about a little bit. Doesn't he?

232
00:20:55,143 --> 00:20:59,493
That one tonight, for instance.
The top half's as good as new.

233
00:20:59,702 --> 00:21:02,485
We could sell what's left elsewhere.

234
00:21:03,793 --> 00:21:06,604
You said we could supply him with more.

235
00:21:06,605 --> 00:21:08,959
What'd you like, gentlemen?

236
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,024
- You, for a start.
- Oh. Cheeky, aren't we?

237
00:21:15,455 --> 00:21:18,761
- I can afford to be.
- And, uhm...

238
00:21:18,762 --> 00:21:21,597
What would a girl have to do
to get that, then?

239
00:21:24,815 --> 00:21:27,290
Nothing that's not in her nature.

240
00:21:28,072 --> 00:21:30,559
We'll have two pints of porter.

241
00:21:30,945 --> 00:21:32,814
For the time being.

242
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:37,361
Have what you want,
as long as you can pay.

243
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:48,628
I've seen this girl before.

244
00:21:48,629 --> 00:21:51,378
She works at the tavern.
- Worked.

245
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:55,767
Worked at the tavern.
That's the correct vernacular I think.

246
00:21:55,768 --> 00:21:58,910
- Very educated is Burke.
Very educated.

247
00:22:01,078 --> 00:22:02,979
And her neck...

248
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,623
She's been...
- Dead for some little while.

249
00:22:06,183 --> 00:22:08,697
That's all you need to know, Doctor.
Isn't it?

250
00:22:08,698 --> 00:22:11,163
That's all you really need to know.

251
00:22:11,218 --> 00:22:14,641
I mean, if you wish to make deeper inquiries...

252
00:22:14,886 --> 00:22:17,297
I could cut off your...

253
00:22:17,584 --> 00:22:19,356
... source of supply.

254
00:22:21,838 --> 00:22:24,283
Better make up your mind, Doctor.

255
00:22:24,284 --> 00:22:26,508
We can do business elsewhere.

256
00:22:29,419 --> 00:22:31,084
I thought so.

257
00:22:31,581 --> 00:22:34,513
Done business with your
kind of gentlemen before.

258
00:22:36,015 --> 00:22:38,374
All in the cause of science. Eh, Doctor?

259
00:22:39,338 --> 00:22:42,201
I mean, you got to do bad to do good. Ain't you?

260
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,738
Doctor Jekyll...

261
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:57,316
It is Doctor Jekyll?

262
00:22:57,656 --> 00:23:00,407
Forgive me for introducing
myself in this way,...

263
00:23:00,409 --> 00:23:02,076
... but I'm Susan Spencer.

264
00:23:02,767 --> 00:23:04,934
We have the rooms above yours.

265
00:23:05,818 --> 00:23:09,443
- Well, I'm sorry if I've made too much
noise of late, but I've been working.

266
00:23:09,444 --> 00:23:11,172
It will soon be finished.

267
00:23:11,173 --> 00:23:13,435
- You misunderstand.
I haven't come to complain.

268
00:23:13,436 --> 00:23:15,737
I merely wish to invite you for dinner.

269
00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:19,331
- Dinner?
- I know you've been working very hard.

270
00:23:19,332 --> 00:23:22,761
And I thought...
- I'm sorry. It's uncommonly kind of you.

271
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,197
But I'm very busy at this moment.

272
00:23:25,198 --> 00:23:27,410
Some other time, perhaps?

273
00:23:27,411 --> 00:23:28,975
Yes. Yes, indeed.

274
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:43,778
Never mind. He might just have
had another engagement.

275
00:23:43,779 --> 00:23:46,012
No, he said he was too busy.

276
00:23:46,013 --> 00:23:47,782
Too busy?

277
00:23:48,902 --> 00:23:51,119
Or impervious to women.

278
00:24:58,957 --> 00:25:01,165
There, someone's knocked
something over.

279
00:25:01,647 --> 00:25:03,801
- You don't think something
could be wrong?

280
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:05,868
That we ought to go down there
and see that he that he's...

281
00:25:05,869 --> 00:25:08,688
Susan, isn't one rebuff enough for you?

282
00:26:18,064 --> 00:26:20,435
There is something wrong.

283
00:26:21,341 --> 00:26:23,090
I just know there is.

284
00:26:24,815 --> 00:26:26,620
Something terribly wrong.

285
00:26:27,025 --> 00:26:28,290
Howard?

286
00:26:28,291 --> 00:26:31,860
He might just have fallen.
Or be ill, or something.

287
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,567
Alright, mother.

288
00:26:34,568 --> 00:26:36,850
I'll go down and see.

289
00:26:37,049 --> 00:26:39,001
Will that satisfy you?

290
00:26:59,476 --> 00:27:01,355
Doctor Jekyll?

291
00:27:18,699 --> 00:27:20,782
I'm... s-sorry.

292
00:27:26,164 --> 00:27:27,885
Forgive me.

293
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:45,428
I take it all back about Dr Jekyll
being impervious to women.

294
00:27:46,505 --> 00:27:49,695
A- and...
He is busy tonight.

295
00:27:52,142 --> 00:27:54,192
Very busy, I should think.

296
00:27:58,133 --> 00:27:59,950
I envy him.

297
00:28:27,344 --> 00:28:29,704
He does seem to got the joke.

298
00:30:51,501 --> 00:30:53,354
Miss Spencer?

299
00:30:55,842 --> 00:30:58,649
The time...
Do you have the correct time?

300
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:03,346
I have been working,
I've lost all account.

301
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:08,016
It's soon after eleven.

302
00:31:08,017 --> 00:31:10,943
But surely your friend
could have told you that.

303
00:31:12,014 --> 00:31:15,796
I'm sorry you were too busy to dine
with us last night, Doctor Jekyll.

304
00:31:15,797 --> 00:31:18,764
I didn't realize you had
a prior engagement.

305
00:31:18,909 --> 00:31:21,565
My brother tells me
she's very attractive.

306
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:23,911
He saw her? But, how did he...

307
00:31:24,756 --> 00:31:27,781
Your brother saw her?
- Last night.

308
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,921
Didn't she tell you?

309
00:31:31,753 --> 00:31:33,857
Oh, you mean my...

310
00:31:34,414 --> 00:31:36,514
My sister?

311
00:31:37,051 --> 00:31:38,961
Sister?

312
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,531
- Yes.
- Oh...

313
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:46,233
I look forward to meeting her someday.

314
00:31:46,234 --> 00:31:48,788
What is her name?

315
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:50,454
Uhm...

316
00:31:53,676 --> 00:31:55,544
Hyde.

317
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:59,007
Her name is Hyde...
Mrs Hyde.

318
00:32:02,163 --> 00:32:04,207
She's a widow.

319
00:32:05,227 --> 00:32:07,001
Excuse me.

320
00:32:29,917 --> 00:32:33,478
He has sister?
And a widow, you said?

321
00:32:33,959 --> 00:32:36,033
That is interesting news.

322
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,405
This may quite be my day.

323
00:32:39,149 --> 00:32:41,307
She is a damn pretty woman.

324
00:32:41,308 --> 00:32:43,175
- Howard!
- Oh...

325
00:32:43,483 --> 00:32:45,123
Sorry, mother.

326
00:32:45,407 --> 00:32:48,161
Just the same,
she is deuce attractive.

327
00:32:49,282 --> 00:32:52,096
Jekyll having a sister like that?

328
00:32:53,134 --> 00:32:54,948
Never thought he had it in him.

329
00:32:55,262 --> 00:32:57,556
So you see, we were both wrong.

330
00:32:57,557 --> 00:32:59,389
And yet both right.

331
00:33:00,733 --> 00:33:01,990
Mmm...

332
00:33:05,263 --> 00:33:09,330
What the devil do you mean?
- Oh, the insect, you recall.

333
00:33:09,681 --> 00:33:13,093
I said it was male, you pointed
out that it couldn't be.

334
00:33:13,436 --> 00:33:16,302
But it was male before I treated it.

335
00:33:16,491 --> 00:33:19,337
You mean, you changed it's sex?

336
00:33:20,615 --> 00:33:24,157
- I invested it with female
characteristics, yes.

337
00:33:25,377 --> 00:33:29,948
- Keep away from me, my boy.
I'm having far too much fun that way I am.

338
00:33:30,199 --> 00:33:32,891
But I did succeed in extending life.

339
00:33:33,212 --> 00:33:35,264
Somewhere I've gone wrong.

340
00:33:36,113 --> 00:33:37,515
Somewhere...

341
00:33:39,236 --> 00:33:41,660
Perhaps from the very beginning.

342
00:33:41,661 --> 00:33:44,820
Playing around with things
you don't fully understand.

343
00:33:44,821 --> 00:33:47,568
Oh, take my advice, dear chap,
and give it up.

344
00:33:47,569 --> 00:33:50,626
Get back to your own line of research.
- I can't give it up, not now.

345
00:33:50,663 --> 00:33:52,757
I'm so close. I must continue.

346
00:33:52,758 --> 00:33:55,916
I can't! There's been a message for me?
None at all?

347
00:33:55,917 --> 00:33:57,614
No. No, sir.

348
00:34:00,476 --> 00:34:03,019
Secret assignation?

349
00:34:03,435 --> 00:34:06,673
- No, it's just... Just two fellows
who said they'd meet me here.

350
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,167
Forgive me.

351
00:34:18,943 --> 00:34:22,793
Of course, I know where they're staying.
- Then take me to them.

352
00:34:23,249 --> 00:34:25,817
Huh... I don't know about that.

353
00:34:25,818 --> 00:34:28,909
Burke and Hare  , they're very funny
customers, aren't they?

354
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:31,318
They'll want to see me.

355
00:34:37,556 --> 00:34:39,337
Alright.

356
00:34:40,415 --> 00:34:42,534
They're at Mrs Murphy's.

357
00:34:43,557 --> 00:34:46,232
It's not far.
We can walk.

358
00:35:01,021 --> 00:35:03,342
Looking for something, darling?

359
00:35:03,343 --> 00:35:06,205
- I'm not looking for you, Yvonne.
I'm looking for Mrs Murphy.

360
00:35:06,206 --> 00:35:08,655
- Mrs Murphy ain't there.
- Where is she, then?

361
00:35:08,656 --> 00:35:11,681
- Floating down the river,
I shouldn't wonder.

362
00:35:12,046 --> 00:35:13,977
What's going on?

363
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:18,596
- Burke and Hare! The grave-robbers!
That's what! And she's been a boarding both of them.

364
00:35:18,597 --> 00:35:20,555
That lenient bitch.

365
00:35:20,557 --> 00:35:23,185
That will teach her to have
body-snatchers under her roof.

366
00:35:23,186 --> 00:35:25,279
Here, you let go off me!

367
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,287
Unless you mean it.

368
00:35:28,541 --> 00:35:30,983
Unless you've got...
half-a-crown.

369
00:35:30,984 --> 00:35:33,048
Get off of him!

370
00:35:33,049 --> 00:35:35,614
Where are Burke and Hare now?

371
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:41,111
Burke's up there!

372
00:35:41,307 --> 00:35:43,802
We give a lift-up in the world.

373
00:35:48,936 --> 00:35:52,817
Burke by name, and a burke by nature.

374
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:58,674
Come on, Doctor. Let's get away from here.
- No! Hare...

375
00:35:58,676 --> 00:36:00,972
If I could only see Hare...

376
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:03,787
Oh, you can see him...

377
00:36:03,788 --> 00:36:07,127
But I doubt very much
if he'll be able to see you.

378
00:36:07,344 --> 00:36:10,198
Not after he gets out of the lime pit.

379
00:36:37,774 --> 00:36:40,324
I'm sorry...

380
00:36:40,325 --> 00:36:43,868
It's got nothing to do with me,
but I've heard you pacing there for hours.

381
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:45,887
I know you haven't eaten.

382
00:36:46,763 --> 00:36:49,094
Please don't be offended.

383
00:36:49,705 --> 00:36:51,611
I'm flattered.

384
00:36:51,852 --> 00:36:53,854
Not offended.

385
00:36:55,591 --> 00:36:58,426
Would it compromise you if you
took a glass of wine with me?

386
00:36:58,428 --> 00:37:00,024
Thank you.

387
00:37:02,683 --> 00:37:05,262
You must think me a strange man.

388
00:37:07,292 --> 00:37:08,755
No.

389
00:37:10,524 --> 00:37:12,762
I think you're noble.

390
00:37:13,696 --> 00:37:18,710
I think you're working on something good.
And dedicated to it. Far too dedicated.

391
00:37:20,861 --> 00:37:23,173
I'm delighted to make you eat.

392
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,909
But I wish I could make you rest.

393
00:37:27,552 --> 00:37:30,003
To stop driving yourself so hard.

394
00:37:30,902 --> 00:37:32,493
I can't.

395
00:37:33,713 --> 00:37:35,667
Not until I've made a decision.

396
00:37:41,701 --> 00:37:44,607
Your health and my gratitude.

397
00:37:47,968 --> 00:37:49,559
Please.

398
00:37:56,521 --> 00:37:58,673
What kind of decision?

399
00:37:59,242 --> 00:38:03,890
- It's a question of morality.
I have to weigh an evil against an unquestioned good.

400
00:38:05,987 --> 00:38:09,128
A life-boat with...
half-a-dozen people aboard.

401
00:38:09,129 --> 00:38:12,304
And a big steamliner with,
perhaps, five hundred.

402
00:38:12,569 --> 00:38:16,354
Would you sacrifice the life-boat
to safe the steamliner?

403
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:20,595
- It's absolutely necessary
to sacrifice the life-boat?

404
00:38:20,596 --> 00:38:22,532
To save the liner, yes.

405
00:38:23,318 --> 00:38:25,170
Then you must.

406
00:38:26,792 --> 00:38:29,567
Any means is worth the end-result?

407
00:38:29,568 --> 00:38:33,363
- If the end-result is worthwhile
and important enough...

408
00:38:33,669 --> 00:38:37,069
Then you have no alternative.
- Any means?

409
00:38:38,103 --> 00:38:42,434
<i>I decided I must take human life
so as to eventually prolong it.</i>

410
00:38:42,766 --> 00:38:45,619
<i>And then came the next terrible decision.</i>

411
00:38:46,562 --> 00:38:48,170
<i>Who?</i>

412
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:53,984
<i>At the end of the next long street</i>

413
00:38:53,985 --> 00:38:56,256
<i>He'll be there</i>

414
00:38:56,726 --> 00:39:00,052
<i>Around the next-up corner</i>

415
00:39:00,053 --> 00:39:01,933
<i>Waiting there</i>

416
00:39:05,137 --> 00:39:06,302
Hello...

417
00:39:06,303 --> 00:39:08,414
Looking for something?

418
00:39:10,205 --> 00:39:12,603
Well, it wasn't me!
I can tell you it wasn't me!

419
00:39:12,604 --> 00:39:15,335
- Well it was one of you!
Want a punch of bogus ratching-o?

420
00:39:15,336 --> 00:39:17,713
- Come on, Jack.
Leave her!

421
00:39:17,714 --> 00:39:19,788
Come on! Do you want the law here?

422
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,909
That... That filthy, dirty...

423
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:23,487
Come on. She's not worth it.

424
00:39:23,488 --> 00:39:25,587
I should have killed her...
That sort, they're not worth two pence.

425
00:39:26,332 --> 00:39:29,253
I'd be doing everybody a favor if I killed her...
- Her included!

426
00:39:40,371 --> 00:39:42,155
Thank you, kind sir.

427
00:39:42,156 --> 00:39:45,020
You're a gentleman.
- May I escort you?

428
00:39:45,688 --> 00:39:47,344
Oh...

429
00:39:47,574 --> 00:39:49,657
A real gentleman...

430
00:39:51,323 --> 00:39:52,912
I knew it.

431
00:39:54,919 --> 00:39:57,634
I'm really popular with real gentlemen.

432
00:39:57,715 --> 00:40:00,347
<i>On the account of the fact
that I speak fluent French.</i>

433
00:40:11,833 --> 00:40:14,540
'Course, I come from very good stock too, you know.

434
00:40:15,129 --> 00:40:17,233
My father was a gentleman.

435
00:40:17,688 --> 00:40:20,332
But he wasn't gentleman enough
to marry me mother.

436
00:40:23,041 --> 00:40:24,766
Oh, that's by-the-by.

437
00:40:25,232 --> 00:40:28,060
Point is, I can tell a real gentleman.

438
00:40:28,708 --> 00:40:30,755
Not by the way he looks...

439
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,822
But, well...
Real gentlemen...

440
00:40:33,823 --> 00:40:37,119
... they have such...
sophisticated taste in...

441
00:40:37,829 --> 00:40:39,398
... certain things.

442
00:40:41,043 --> 00:40:43,021
A quiet one, aren't we?

443
00:40:44,684 --> 00:40:46,826
You've hardly said a word.

444
00:40:46,931 --> 00:40:51,050
Well, if you'd lost the use of your tongue,
perhaps you haven't lost the use of your hands.

445
00:40:51,152 --> 00:40:53,209
Undo me.
Please, dear.

446
00:41:07,332 --> 00:41:08,296
Oh.

447
00:41:08,297 --> 00:41:10,661
I hope you're not going
to be too vigorous, dear.

448
00:41:10,662 --> 00:41:13,655
I mean, it's been a long, hard night
and I don't want any...

449
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,350
Hear this!

450
00:42:12,478 --> 00:42:14,534
Hear this!

451
00:42:16,419 --> 00:42:18,210
Hear this!

452
00:42:20,158 --> 00:42:25,129
Good people of Whitechapel!
Hear this!

453
00:42:26,825 --> 00:42:28,545
A murder!

454
00:42:29,694 --> 00:42:33,833
<i>Foul and horrible, grizzly murder!</i>

455
00:42:34,388 --> 00:42:36,696
<i>Took place within this precinct...</i>

456
00:42:36,697 --> 00:42:38,255
Howard, please!

457
00:42:38,256 --> 00:42:40,822
There's some excitement in the area.

458
00:42:40,823 --> 00:42:44,864
- It's nothing to do with us.
It does not concern us.

459
00:42:45,055 --> 00:42:46,710
<i>... murder!</i>

460
00:42:48,588 --> 00:42:50,202
Hear this!

461
00:42:51,156 --> 00:42:52,696
Hear this!

462
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,620
Hear this!

463
00:42:57,553 --> 00:43:00,434
Good people of Whitechapel!

464
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:02,405
Hear this!

465
00:43:06,131 --> 00:43:07,915
Murder!

466
00:43:18,913 --> 00:43:20,656
Well, professor?

467
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:25,390
Oh, the mutilations are expertly done.

468
00:43:25,774 --> 00:43:27,896
Most expertly done!

469
00:43:27,992 --> 00:43:30,367
A butcher? A slaughter-man?

470
00:43:30,583 --> 00:43:34,079
- Is very possibly.
He certainly knew what he was doing.

471
00:43:35,026 --> 00:43:36,983
And mad just the same.

472
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:40,286
I mean, who else but a madman
would do that to a woman?

473
00:44:33,656 --> 00:44:35,275
Miss Spencer!

474
00:44:35,276 --> 00:44:37,806
Oh, please. I'd much prefer Susan.

475
00:44:37,807 --> 00:44:39,813
I've brought you some supper.

476
00:44:40,419 --> 00:44:43,920
- That's kind of you, most kind...
I'll eat it later.

477
00:44:44,104 --> 00:44:46,105
You... mustn't stay.
Mustn't...

478
00:44:46,106 --> 00:44:47,323
You're ill.

479
00:44:47,324 --> 00:44:49,700
- It's just a slight headache, it will...
- But you're trembling!

480
00:44:49,701 --> 00:44:52,408
You have a fever!
- For God's sake, leave me! Leave me now!

481
00:46:49,512 --> 00:46:51,359
Good evening.

482
00:46:52,943 --> 00:46:55,062
It's Hyde, isn't it?

483
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:57,396
Mrs Hyde?

484
00:46:58,694 --> 00:47:00,219
Is it?

485
00:47:00,597 --> 00:47:05,080
- The... last time we met
I didn't get an opportunity to...

486
00:47:07,435 --> 00:47:09,036
... introduce myself.

487
00:47:10,082 --> 00:47:12,646
I am Howard,
Howard Sencer.

488
00:47:13,722 --> 00:47:16,009
Howard Spencer...

489
00:47:17,897 --> 00:47:19,497
Yes.

490
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:23,335
Uh, how is your brother?

491
00:47:23,336 --> 00:47:25,916
- Brother?
- Doctor Jekyll.

492
00:47:25,917 --> 00:47:27,969
Oh. He...

493
00:47:30,543 --> 00:47:33,386
He hasn't been himself of late.

494
00:47:34,387 --> 00:47:37,038
Oh, I am sorry to hear that.

495
00:47:39,452 --> 00:47:41,107
Eh, well...

496
00:47:42,692 --> 00:47:44,946
I'll see you again...

497
00:47:46,176 --> 00:47:47,856
I hope.

498
00:47:49,712 --> 00:47:51,376
Howard?

499
00:47:53,281 --> 00:47:55,713
I hope we shall meet again.

500
00:48:09,705 --> 00:48:12,854
Well! I may not have
much time for Dr Jekyll,

501
00:48:12,855 --> 00:48:16,080
but his sister is absolutely marvelous.

502
00:48:16,081 --> 00:48:19,728
- You've just seen her?
- Yes. She's downstairs now.

503
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:23,333
- I'd love to meet her.
Mamma, do you suppose...

504
00:48:23,485 --> 00:48:27,067
- Well, you could hardly go barging in
without an invitation.

505
00:48:27,516 --> 00:48:29,787
But, you do have that tray to collect.

506
00:48:42,226 --> 00:48:43,814
Doctor Jekyll?

507
00:50:55,453 --> 00:50:57,473
It's the same as before.

508
00:50:58,018 --> 00:51:00,084
A same devilish hand.

509
00:51:01,346 --> 00:51:03,039
But, professor...

510
00:51:03,612 --> 00:51:06,093
Why would any man do that?

511
00:51:08,553 --> 00:51:11,247
She was very young... and pretty.

512
00:51:13,788 --> 00:51:15,466
Ah, Byker!

513
00:51:15,467 --> 00:51:17,480
A word with you.

514
00:51:18,014 --> 00:51:19,744
I'll see you later.

515
00:51:23,676 --> 00:51:26,543
You seen this one?
Not very nice.

516
00:51:27,801 --> 00:51:29,716
I'm used to it.

517
00:51:30,812 --> 00:51:33,241
Anything familiar about it?

518
00:51:33,397 --> 00:51:34,971
Familiar?

519
00:51:35,444 --> 00:51:38,632
When you've been around
as many bodies as I have...

520
00:51:44,848 --> 00:51:46,837
How's Doctor Jekyll?

521
00:51:47,381 --> 00:51:48,971
Jekyll?

522
00:51:48,973 --> 00:51:51,113
Well, I should imagine.

523
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:56,654
You hadn't been supplying
him lately then?

524
00:51:59,099 --> 00:52:01,849
- Not lately, no.
- I see.

525
00:52:04,063 --> 00:52:07,153
There's no point in offering him this one.

526
00:52:07,817 --> 00:52:10,736
What he wants has already been taken.

527
00:52:46,036 --> 00:52:48,869
Am I disturbing you?
- No, I'm glad to see you.

528
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:51,518
I wanted to see you to apologize
for my behavior last night.

529
00:52:51,519 --> 00:52:53,599
- You're feeling better.
- Yes. Come in.

530
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,686
Let me take that.
- Oh, thank you.

531
00:52:56,071 --> 00:52:57,767
Sit down.

532
00:53:04,910 --> 00:53:08,676
What's burning?
- Oh, just some old clothes.

533
00:53:10,203 --> 00:53:12,382
Well, not old, exactly...

534
00:53:12,383 --> 00:53:15,097
Stained by chemicals, you see.
I'm...

535
00:53:15,098 --> 00:53:16,933
I'm afraid I was careless.

536
00:53:16,934 --> 00:53:18,970
Well, as long as you replace them.

537
00:53:18,971 --> 00:53:21,425
- Yes, I've already ordered some
and they're sending them over.

538
00:53:21,426 --> 00:53:24,705
- Oh, that must be them.
It was outside the door.

539
00:53:24,706 --> 00:53:26,551
Oh, I see. Thank you.

540
00:53:28,048 --> 00:53:30,768
- You've heard about the
murders, of course. Two.

541
00:53:30,769 --> 00:53:34,342
Mamma is absolutely terrified,
just completely forbidden me to...

542
00:53:34,896 --> 00:53:37,528
Fools! The blasted fools!

543
00:53:37,529 --> 00:53:41,201
How could they've made such a stupid mistake?
I specifically ordered them to...

544
00:53:43,326 --> 00:53:45,279
It's not even your colour.

545
00:53:53,505 --> 00:53:55,768
- But it's not a mistake...
- What?

546
00:53:55,769 --> 00:53:58,544
- They're for your sister.
You see?

547
00:53:59,422 --> 00:54:01,552
Charged to Mrs Hyde.

548
00:54:05,601 --> 00:54:09,677
<i>Around the next-up corner</i>

549
00:54:09,678 --> 00:54:12,856
<i>Please make him there</i>

550
00:54:13,374 --> 00:54:16,304
<i>Waiting there</i>

551
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:22,499
<i>I'll keep searching, looking,
waiting, hoping</i>

552
00:54:22,662 --> 00:54:23,905
<i>He'll be there</i>

553
00:54:23,906 --> 00:54:26,872
I hope you know what
you're up to, professor.

554
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:30,085
I merely want you to wait and to observe.

555
00:54:30,318 --> 00:54:32,430
Depends on how long I have to wait.

556
00:54:33,022 --> 00:54:36,134
At the moment,
there's not much to observe.

557
00:54:37,169 --> 00:54:40,094
He's at home. He's awake.

558
00:54:42,097 --> 00:54:46,395
There's nothing else to report.
- Patience, sergeant Danvers. Patience.

559
00:54:47,199 --> 00:54:49,054
And moderation.

560
00:54:49,251 --> 00:54:51,801
I want a sober and reliable witness.

561
00:54:52,322 --> 00:54:54,434
Witness to what?

562
00:54:54,435 --> 00:54:56,100
Maybe nothing.

563
00:54:56,102 --> 00:54:58,840
We shall just have to wait and see.

564
00:55:41,473 --> 00:55:43,187
A man.

565
00:55:43,188 --> 00:55:45,163
They'll be looking for a man.

566
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:49,646
- What was that you were saying
about moderation?

567
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:52,649
Don't do as I do, sergeant.

568
00:55:54,069 --> 00:55:55,852
Do as I say.

569
00:55:56,966 --> 00:55:59,407
He's got a woman in there.

570
00:55:59,598 --> 00:56:01,192
What?

571
00:56:01,377 --> 00:56:04,486
- Just now... I saw a woman
go past the window.

572
00:56:05,169 --> 00:56:09,007
- Where? - She's gone now,
but there was a woman.

573
00:56:10,330 --> 00:56:12,188
Are you sure?

574
00:56:12,189 --> 00:56:14,968
It was a woman. I saw her shape clearly!

575
00:56:14,969 --> 00:56:18,662
I'm no bloody Lothario,
but I can tell a woman when I see one.

576
00:56:18,663 --> 00:56:20,526
Oh, there she goes again.

577
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:22,811
Ah...

578
00:56:25,302 --> 00:56:28,312
Oh, perhaps Jekyll has
taken my advice at last.

579
00:56:28,313 --> 00:56:30,528
And forsaken research for a while.

580
00:56:31,644 --> 00:56:34,443
- I hope that doesn't mean we're
sitting here for nothing?

581
00:56:34,444 --> 00:56:36,662
With an empty brandy flask.

582
00:57:00,589 --> 00:57:02,324
Mrs Hyde?

583
00:57:12,839 --> 00:57:14,634
Someone coming out.

584
00:57:15,815 --> 00:57:17,610
It's a woman...

585
00:57:19,775 --> 00:57:22,653
And a deuced pretty one, too.

586
00:57:28,686 --> 00:57:30,292
Professor...

587
00:57:30,726 --> 00:57:33,522
There. That's where we're supposed
to be looking at.

588
00:57:34,167 --> 00:57:36,737
With an empty brandy flask.

589
00:58:30,217 --> 00:58:33,412
Trouble with you is you don't know
when you've had enough.

590
00:58:36,490 --> 00:58:38,998
You didn't aught to have had that last gin.

591
00:58:39,622 --> 00:58:42,999
- I'm alright.
- Well, you go straight home, mind.

592
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,352
Don't you be talking to any
strange men, or familiar ones, either.

593
00:58:46,353 --> 00:58:49,327
I'm telling you, I'll be alright.

594
00:58:51,072 --> 00:58:54,285
Hey, just a minute! Come here!
- Here, what's it now?

595
00:58:54,810 --> 00:58:56,593
Over there.

596
00:58:58,125 --> 00:59:00,233
- Where?
- Someone waiting.

597
00:59:03,109 --> 00:59:05,529
Oh, it's only a lady...

598
00:59:06,537 --> 00:59:08,134
Later, Vonne.

599
00:59:08,135 --> 00:59:09,831
Night. - Night.

600
00:59:19,531 --> 00:59:21,195
Excuse me...

601
00:59:22,432 --> 00:59:25,669
Do you mind if I walk a little way
with you? Company?

602
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:29,262
- Well, with a murderer about,
I'll be glad of it.

603
00:59:29,661 --> 00:59:31,097
Here.

604
00:59:32,232 --> 00:59:35,561
You don't think he'd
do 'em in twos, do you?

605
01:00:30,028 --> 01:00:31,940
Who are you?

606
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:33,965
Do I know you?

607
01:00:34,318 --> 01:00:36,361
I don't think so...

608
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:39,385
No, I don't think so.

609
01:00:41,702 --> 01:00:43,846
Sir Danvers! Sir Danvers!

610
01:00:44,925 --> 01:00:47,122
There's been another murder.

611
01:00:48,064 --> 01:00:50,100
<i>- Where?
- Hornsy Lane, sir.</i>

612
01:00:51,337 --> 01:00:52,979
Hornsy Lane!

613
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:55,758
There. It explodes your theory about Dr Jekyll.

614
01:00:56,047 --> 01:00:57,800
Whip him up!

615
01:01:34,545 --> 01:01:36,181
Any comments, sir?

616
01:01:36,578 --> 01:01:39,729
None... that I haven't already made.

617
01:01:41,550 --> 01:01:43,618
It's a queer business, sergeant.

618
01:01:44,099 --> 01:01:45,859
Very queer.

619
01:01:48,934 --> 01:01:50,493
Oh, I'm sorry...

620
01:01:52,538 --> 01:01:53,654
Ah...

621
01:01:53,655 --> 01:01:55,321
Doctor Jekyll.

622
01:01:57,011 --> 01:01:58,299
Uhm...

623
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:00,041
Good evening.

624
01:02:01,155 --> 01:02:02,630
And, uh...

625
01:02:02,631 --> 01:02:04,905
How is your delightful sister?

626
01:02:05,512 --> 01:02:08,060
F- fine... Excellent.

627
01:02:08,792 --> 01:02:11,034
I am in excellent health.

628
01:02:11,498 --> 01:02:12,878
Oh, it...

629
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:14,815
It... No, no, you've...

630
01:02:14,816 --> 01:02:17,150
You misunderstand me, your sister.

631
01:02:18,578 --> 01:02:20,207
Howard...

632
01:02:59,932 --> 01:03:01,814
No! Don't you hear me? No!

633
01:03:05,908 --> 01:03:07,922
Jekyll, my dear chap...

634
01:03:08,721 --> 01:03:10,755
I just happen to be passing.

635
01:03:12,345 --> 01:03:15,905
And so I thought -- marvelous opportunity
to catch up on your news.

636
01:03:16,206 --> 01:03:18,545
See just how much progress you've...

637
01:03:19,146 --> 01:03:20,991
... you've been making.

638
01:03:21,485 --> 01:03:24,076
Seems rather more than I'd anticipated.

639
01:03:26,291 --> 01:03:29,218
Taken my advice, eh?
- No...

640
01:03:30,167 --> 01:03:31,846
Well, I... I mean...

641
01:03:31,847 --> 01:03:34,236
No need to be embarassed, dear chap.

642
01:03:34,237 --> 01:03:36,362
Perfectly normal and natural.

643
01:03:36,538 --> 01:03:38,981
Been preaching it to you for years...

644
01:03:39,198 --> 01:03:41,760
Get a woman in your life...
A good woman.

645
01:03:41,761 --> 01:03:45,297
And one day you'll wake up,
you'll look at yourself in the mirror

646
01:03:45,298 --> 01:03:47,417
and you'll see a changed man.

647
01:03:48,204 --> 01:03:49,963
But, Robertson, I...

648
01:03:49,964 --> 01:03:51,995
I don't mean to be rude, but...

649
01:03:52,896 --> 01:03:55,919
- Understand, dear chap.
Understand absolutely.

650
01:03:56,223 --> 01:04:00,138
The two is company,
three -- positive deviation.

651
01:04:02,496 --> 01:04:04,858
I'll, uh... I'll leave you to it.

652
01:04:09,302 --> 01:04:11,746
Terrible thing, these murders.

653
01:04:14,667 --> 01:04:16,327
Murders?

654
01:04:16,737 --> 01:04:18,363
Oh, come now...

655
01:04:18,364 --> 01:04:22,479
I know you're a remote sort of fellow,
but they've been happening all around you.

656
01:04:23,686 --> 01:04:27,451
- Oh, yes. The murders. I've...
paid them little heed, I'm afraid.

657
01:04:27,556 --> 01:04:29,648
My... work, you see.

658
01:04:30,193 --> 01:04:32,713
The elusive elixir of life.

659
01:04:32,836 --> 01:04:34,801
How's it going?

660
01:04:35,115 --> 01:04:36,657
Well.

661
01:04:36,877 --> 01:04:39,232
Very well. Couldn't be better.

662
01:04:40,686 --> 01:04:42,551
I'm glad to hear it.

663
01:04:47,207 --> 01:04:48,832
Most glad.

664
01:04:54,662 --> 01:04:57,171
<i>I was caught in a terrible trap.</i>

665
01:04:57,172 --> 01:05:00,206
<i>To continue my work
I needed sister Hyde.</i>

666
01:05:00,207 --> 01:05:05,067
<i>Yet, all the time I became more and more
aware of her growing dominance within me.</i>

667
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:10,289
<i>A dominance I no longer had the strength
to fight, contain or control.</i>

668
01:05:22,661 --> 01:05:25,200
Hello, darling.
Looking for something?

669
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:35,382
Yes, constable? What is it?
- Another murder, sir.

670
01:06:35,419 --> 01:06:37,774
In Legger Button yard.
Sergeant Danvers...

671
01:06:37,775 --> 01:06:41,361
- When did this happen?
- Very recent, sir. Minute, probably.

672
01:06:41,362 --> 01:06:43,455
Trail is quite fresh.

673
01:06:43,456 --> 01:06:47,138
- Yes, well, tell sergeant Danvers
I'll be with him directly. - Sir.

674
01:06:50,687 --> 01:06:53,510
At first, there's another call I must make.

675
01:07:00,915 --> 01:07:02,553
Professor Robertson.

676
01:07:03,154 --> 01:07:05,996
But, of course, it could only be you.

677
01:07:06,749 --> 01:07:09,168
You have me to disadvantage, ma'm.

678
01:07:09,452 --> 01:07:12,428
- My brother has told me
so much about you.

679
01:07:12,429 --> 01:07:14,229
Won't you come in?

680
01:07:15,626 --> 01:07:17,356
Your brother?

681
01:07:19,953 --> 01:07:22,661
Doctor Jekyll. I'm his sister.

682
01:07:23,651 --> 01:07:25,551
The deuce you are!

683
01:07:25,552 --> 01:07:28,164
He never mentioned that he had a sister.

684
01:07:28,727 --> 01:07:30,502
And such a sister.

685
01:07:33,333 --> 01:07:37,023
- Uh, oh... Forgive me, ma'm.
It is your brother I came to see.

686
01:07:37,765 --> 01:07:39,487
He's not here.

687
01:07:40,067 --> 01:07:41,871
Thought as much.

688
01:07:41,872 --> 01:07:44,419
How long has he been out?
All evening?

689
01:07:44,628 --> 01:07:47,129
Haven't seen him since I arrived.

690
01:07:47,670 --> 01:07:50,790
I knew it. I knew I was right.

691
01:07:51,833 --> 01:07:54,066
I don't understand...

692
01:07:54,886 --> 01:07:58,157
- Perhaps I shouldn't be saying
this to you, ma'm, but,

693
01:07:58,158 --> 01:08:00,714
I have grave suspicions...

694
01:08:01,755 --> 01:08:03,787
Very grave suspicions.

695
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:05,641
Suspicions?

696
01:08:05,642 --> 01:08:08,797
About his actions, his state of mind.

697
01:08:09,445 --> 01:08:11,848
Professor, I'll be honest with you.

698
01:08:11,849 --> 01:08:15,478
I, too, have been very anxious
about him of late.

699
01:08:15,479 --> 01:08:17,855
But, we can't talk here.

700
01:08:17,856 --> 01:08:20,451
And if were to return...

701
01:08:21,583 --> 01:08:25,219
There must be somewhere else,
somewhere quieter.

702
01:08:26,111 --> 01:08:28,174
More discreet.

703
01:08:29,266 --> 01:08:31,724
There are my rooms, of course.

704
01:08:32,031 --> 01:08:34,543
But, then you would be unchaperoned.

705
01:08:35,401 --> 01:08:37,670
That would be an adventure.

706
01:08:40,670 --> 01:08:43,569
To date I'd met a very shortened life.

707
01:08:44,334 --> 01:08:45,994
Come, professor.

708
01:09:01,582 --> 01:09:03,309
You did tell him?

709
01:09:03,310 --> 01:09:05,583
Said he'll be along directly, sir.

710
01:09:05,584 --> 01:09:09,055
- Not like professor Robertson...
Not like him at all.

711
01:09:09,364 --> 01:09:11,550
Wonder what's keeping him.

712
01:09:20,798 --> 01:09:22,834
Your brother...

713
01:09:23,442 --> 01:09:25,263
Forget him.

714
01:09:26,424 --> 01:09:28,240
I can't.

715
01:09:29,375 --> 01:09:31,655
That's why I brought you here.

716
01:09:32,401 --> 01:09:34,681
To talk about your brother.

717
01:09:42,278 --> 01:09:44,339
You've heard of the...

718
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:47,723
... murders in this area?
The Whitechapel murders?

719
01:09:48,232 --> 01:09:50,834
Well, I have been involved in them.

720
01:09:50,938 --> 01:09:53,389
In an official capacity.

721
01:09:54,550 --> 01:09:57,728
There's a terrible similarity
about all the victims...

722
01:09:58,659 --> 01:10:01,030
About what he does to them.

723
01:10:02,622 --> 01:10:05,163
I told you I had grave suspicions.

724
01:10:06,032 --> 01:10:08,751
All that suspicion is based on observation.

725
01:10:09,045 --> 01:10:10,937
And my knowledge of your...

726
01:10:11,930 --> 01:10:13,957
... of your brother's work.

727
01:10:17,330 --> 01:10:19,910
I've lived with this problem for days now.

728
01:10:20,721 --> 01:10:23,062
I've struggled with my conscience...

729
01:10:23,787 --> 01:10:28,142
After all, your brother was...
is my friend, I owe him something.

730
01:10:29,790 --> 01:10:32,731
But I have a public responsibility, too.

731
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:36,100
And I am convinced that your brother

732
01:10:36,102 --> 01:10:37,824
is the man who...

733
01:10:57,729 --> 01:10:59,999
We can talk later, professor.

734
01:11:35,881 --> 01:11:37,533
It's you?!

735
01:12:05,817 --> 01:12:07,795
That was a dream...

736
01:12:08,465 --> 01:12:10,327
It is nightmare! No!

737
01:12:24,295 --> 01:12:26,163
Robertson...

738
01:12:30,972 --> 01:12:32,681
It was you!

739
01:12:33,171 --> 01:12:34,706
You!

740
01:12:34,707 --> 01:12:36,583
Well, I'll be rid of you!

741
01:13:27,537 --> 01:13:31,481
It is I who exist, Doctor Jekyll,
not you!

742
01:13:32,079 --> 01:13:34,510
It is I who will be rid of you!

743
01:13:35,866 --> 01:13:38,647
Rid of you! Rid of you!
Rid of you!

744
01:14:00,868 --> 01:14:02,706
Howard.

745
01:14:45,105 --> 01:14:46,612
If you...

746
01:14:48,051 --> 01:14:51,687
If you knew what you...
do to a man...

747
01:14:53,122 --> 01:14:57,144
Oh, if you could imagine
what a man feels when he...

748
01:15:06,006 --> 01:15:07,906
But I can...

749
01:15:09,330 --> 01:15:11,167
... imagine it.

750
01:15:30,390 --> 01:15:32,187
Howard?

751
01:15:32,851 --> 01:15:34,787
Oh, damn...

752
01:15:35,596 --> 01:15:37,256
It's Susan.

753
01:15:39,587 --> 01:15:42,042
Dear sister Susan...

754
01:15:44,746 --> 01:15:46,441
Howard?

755
01:15:48,297 --> 01:15:50,050
Yes, yes...

756
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:56,556
Just come in...

757
01:15:56,557 --> 01:15:58,574
I thought I heard your voice.

758
01:15:59,410 --> 01:16:00,861
Oh...

759
01:16:01,479 --> 01:16:02,638
Er...

760
01:16:02,639 --> 01:16:04,559
This is...

761
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:05,809
... Mrs Hyde.

762
01:16:06,264 --> 01:16:08,443
We were just, eh...

763
01:16:08,766 --> 01:16:10,344
... just talking.

764
01:16:10,668 --> 01:16:12,359
My sister Susan.

765
01:16:12,646 --> 01:16:14,784
I've been longing to meet you.

766
01:16:15,436 --> 01:16:17,720
I... know your brother quite well.

767
01:16:18,575 --> 01:16:20,541
So, I gather.

768
01:16:20,972 --> 01:16:23,358
He's very fond of you, isn't he?

769
01:16:24,052 --> 01:16:25,936
He said that?

770
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:31,207
There are no secrets
between my brother and I.

771
01:16:31,895 --> 01:16:33,269
None.

772
01:16:34,342 --> 01:16:36,240
Yes, he's very fond of you.

773
01:16:37,773 --> 01:16:40,613
And I am very fond of your brother.

774
01:16:42,980 --> 01:16:45,498
A fascinating situation, don't you think?

775
01:16:47,051 --> 01:16:49,821
It'll be interesting to see who wins.

776
01:16:50,054 --> 01:16:51,803
Wins?

777
01:16:52,601 --> 01:16:55,871
- But, of course, I have
the stronger personality.

778
01:16:55,872 --> 01:16:58,708
I always have...
Ever since I...

779
01:17:00,504 --> 01:17:02,727
Ever since the moment I was born.

780
01:17:04,712 --> 01:17:07,451
My poor brother is far too weak.

781
01:17:08,868 --> 01:17:11,106
I don't think he's in the least weak.

782
01:17:11,107 --> 01:17:13,224
But, not like you Howard...

783
01:17:14,387 --> 01:17:15,999
Not like you, you are...

784
01:17:21,669 --> 01:17:24,347
But, now you must go.
Both of you.

785
01:17:25,347 --> 01:17:26,931
Leave me!

786
01:17:26,932 --> 01:17:28,981
When shall I see you again?

787
01:17:29,139 --> 01:17:30,798
Please go.

788
01:17:32,069 --> 01:17:33,765
Leave me!

789
01:18:03,513 --> 01:18:05,557
We'll see who wins.

790
01:18:06,555 --> 01:18:09,034
We'll see.

791
01:18:17,233 --> 01:18:19,231
Knife grinding!

792
01:18:19,677 --> 01:18:21,857
Any knife to grind!

793
01:18:23,115 --> 01:18:24,820
Knife grinding!

794
01:18:25,513 --> 01:18:27,579
Any knife to grinder!

795
01:18:37,615 --> 01:18:39,580
Susan...
- Doctor Jekyll.

796
01:18:39,581 --> 01:18:43,220
Oh, but, you look so ill. You must...
- Just over-worked, that's all.

797
01:18:47,967 --> 01:18:49,984
You saw my sister last night?

798
01:18:49,985 --> 01:18:51,600
Yes.

799
01:18:51,865 --> 01:18:54,181
I want you to promise me something.

800
01:18:54,630 --> 01:18:56,869
Stay away from her.

801
01:18:56,870 --> 01:18:59,696
- Your sister?
But, I don't understand.

802
01:18:59,697 --> 01:19:02,347
I can't explain, just trust me.

803
01:19:02,348 --> 01:19:05,090
Stay away from her,
she means you great harm.

804
01:19:06,055 --> 01:19:07,648
But, why?

805
01:19:08,182 --> 01:19:12,491
And how could you possibly know?
- I just... feel it. That's all.

806
01:19:13,812 --> 01:19:15,933
Promise me you'll do as I say.

807
01:19:17,119 --> 01:19:18,951
If it pleases you.

808
01:19:20,819 --> 01:19:23,104
Thank you.

809
01:19:23,105 --> 01:19:25,924
- And you can do something
for me in return.

810
01:19:26,169 --> 01:19:27,954
Anything.

811
01:19:27,955 --> 01:19:30,478
I have two tickets for the concert tonight.

812
01:19:30,479 --> 01:19:34,571
Howard doesn't care for it, and mamma is too tired...
- I will be delighted to escort you.

813
01:19:34,572 --> 01:19:36,883
If you would come for me at eight o'clock.

814
01:19:58,970 --> 01:20:00,475
Well?

815
01:20:01,734 --> 01:20:03,319
Very pretty.

816
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:05,570
But then, you always do look very pretty.

817
01:20:05,571 --> 01:20:08,336
- But, I want to look specially
attractive tonight.

818
01:20:08,645 --> 01:20:12,277
You think he'll like it?
- That's if he sees it.

819
01:20:12,476 --> 01:20:15,119
Lucky if anyone sees anything tonight.

820
01:20:16,083 --> 01:20:18,536
The fog's like pea soup.

821
01:20:19,942 --> 01:20:22,431
I got lost, twice, on my way home.

822
01:20:23,542 --> 01:20:24,736
Oh...

823
01:20:26,151 --> 01:20:27,837
That's charming.

824
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:31,684
You know, it's quite charming.
- Oh, Howard, do you really think so?

825
01:20:31,746 --> 01:20:34,691
Yes, a positive surfeit of prettiness.

826
01:20:35,623 --> 01:20:37,687
Let's hope it's not wasted.

827
01:20:37,869 --> 01:20:39,544
What do you mean?

828
01:20:39,682 --> 01:20:42,905
- Our Doctor Jekyll's a pretty
unpredictable chap.

829
01:20:43,179 --> 01:20:47,636
It's just the likely that he'll
call it of at the last minute, and...

830
01:20:47,637 --> 01:20:49,598
He wouldn't do that.

831
01:20:49,599 --> 01:20:51,578
He promised.

832
01:20:51,995 --> 01:20:53,285
Mamma...

833
01:20:53,286 --> 01:20:56,659
- No, of course, he wouldn't.
He'll keep his promise.

834
01:20:56,660 --> 01:20:58,559
Howard knows he will.

835
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:03,057
Yes, just teasing you.

836
01:21:43,535 --> 01:21:46,112
You did agree eight o'clock, didn't you, dear?

837
01:21:46,392 --> 01:21:48,491
I think that clock's a little fast.

838
01:21:52,227 --> 01:21:53,917
No...

839
01:21:55,473 --> 01:21:57,117
Yes, just a little.

840
01:22:01,226 --> 01:22:03,518
Perhaps he got lost on the stairs.

841
01:22:06,233 --> 01:22:08,638
Oh, I told you the fog was thick.

842
01:22:10,233 --> 01:22:12,610
He must be on his way by now.

843
01:22:12,861 --> 01:22:15,681
I'll go and meet him half-way.
Bye, mamma.

844
01:22:29,224 --> 01:22:31,032
Doctor Jekyll?

845
01:22:37,506 --> 01:22:39,217
Doctor Jekyll...

846
01:22:43,385 --> 01:22:45,105
Doctor Jekyll?

847
01:22:53,617 --> 01:22:56,209
Doctor Jekyll!

848
01:22:56,981 --> 01:22:58,605
Please...

849
01:23:11,362 --> 01:23:14,049
He's outside, calling a cab.

850
01:23:15,274 --> 01:23:17,086
Good night, Howard.

851
01:23:39,976 --> 01:23:43,282
There will be a different
kind of victim tonight.

852
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:45,607
Not a street-walker.

853
01:23:46,382 --> 01:23:48,864
A fresh, young virgin!

854
01:23:48,865 --> 01:23:52,132
And then, the tug of war
will be ended between us.

855
01:27:36,618 --> 01:27:39,179
<i>I had won a battle, but only just.</i>

856
01:27:39,180 --> 01:27:43,613
<i>I knew it could only be a matter of time
before sister Hyde completely took over.</i>

857
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:47,542
<i>My only hope lay in pin-pointing
the flaw in my researches</i>

858
01:27:47,543 --> 01:27:51,770
<i>and that meant one more experiment,
one final experiment.</i>

859
01:27:52,683 --> 01:27:56,343
<i>So desperately I turned for help to Byker.</i>

860
01:27:57,225 --> 01:28:02,141
I'm very sorry. As you can... see for yourself
I've got nothing that's suitable for you. I'm very sorry.

861
01:28:04,615 --> 01:28:07,955
<i>I had to kill again,
but I dared not evoke Hyde.</i>

862
01:28:08,297 --> 01:28:10,427
<i>I had to do it myself.</i>

863
01:28:10,428 --> 01:28:11,244
<i>Myself.</i>

864
01:28:11,245 --> 01:28:14,202
<i>Myself.
- "Marie, if you find your gent, charge him half a crown".</i>

865
01:28:14,203 --> 01:28:18,935
"Tell him it's gone up,
tell him everything's going up!"

866
01:28:56,463 --> 01:28:59,301
<i>I write this testament as a scientist.</i>

867
01:28:59,302 --> 01:29:02,970
<i>And as a salutary lesson to those
who would tamper with nature.</i>

868
01:29:03,085 --> 01:29:06,849
Laugh if you like,...
but I worked for a man once.

869
01:29:07,199 --> 01:29:09,004
A doctor.

870
01:29:09,005 --> 01:29:12,133
Special work, if...
- Get to the point!

871
01:29:12,475 --> 01:29:14,471
The point is...

872
01:29:14,472 --> 01:29:18,622
We all know how "the ripper"
carves them, don't we?

873
01:29:18,623 --> 01:29:21,860
We all know his particular
little quirks...

874
01:29:22,828 --> 01:29:27,195
Well,... this doctor used to
carve them in the same way.

875
01:29:27,751 --> 01:29:30,148
The self-same way.

876
01:29:31,024 --> 01:29:32,622
Well?

877
01:29:32,724 --> 01:29:35,069
Who is he, this doctor?
What's his name?

878
01:29:35,070 --> 01:29:37,176
- His name?
Oh...

879
01:29:37,454 --> 01:29:41,568
I'll tell you that, perhaps.
After I've had another drink!

880
01:29:44,312 --> 01:29:46,104
Tell me, now!

881
01:29:46,105 --> 01:29:47,671
Right now!

882
01:29:47,783 --> 01:29:52,157
<i>And now it is done. Finished.
And I have destroyed myself.</i>

883
01:29:52,741 --> 01:29:54,911
<i>And those that I loved.</i>

884
01:30:01,438 --> 01:30:04,704
I think that window's open.
Would you close it, Susan, please.

885
01:30:18,806 --> 01:30:22,008
What's the number we got?
- Number 30.

886
01:30:23,013 --> 01:30:24,755
Attention...

887
01:30:38,191 --> 01:30:40,223
Doctor Jekyll?

888
01:30:42,077 --> 01:30:43,622
Police.

889
01:30:50,598 --> 01:30:53,014
Open up, in the name of Law.

890
01:31:03,968 --> 01:31:05,103
What's...

891
01:31:48,207 --> 01:31:50,325
Have you seen him?
- He went back in, sergeant.

892
01:31:50,749 --> 01:31:52,546
Sergeant! Look!

893
01:31:53,978 --> 01:31:55,931
Up you go.

894
01:32:01,384 --> 01:32:03,280
Where's the loft?

895
01:32:03,333 --> 01:32:06,870
- For pity's sake, what's he done?
- He's the Whitechapel murderer.

896
01:32:58,417 --> 01:33:01,055
Don't be a fool! Don't jump!

897
01:33:14,427 --> 01:33:16,143
Downstairs!

898
01:34:55,046 --> 01:34:56,547
No!

899
01:34:57,892 --> 01:35:00,379
No, you'll kill me!
