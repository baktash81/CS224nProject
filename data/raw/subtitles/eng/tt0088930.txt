188
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,061
May I take your bag?

189
00:15:43,132 --> 00:15:45,225
No. I'll leave it here.

190
00:15:45,301 --> 00:15:47,394
It contains evidence, I presume?

191
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,802
It contains surprises, my friend.

192
00:15:51,373 --> 00:15:52,738
Ladies and gentlemen,

193
00:15:52,808 --> 00:15:54,207
may I present Mr. Boddy.

194
00:15:55,678 --> 00:15:58,112
What are they doing here?

195
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,613
Eating dinner.

196
00:15:59,682 --> 00:16:01,616
Do sit down, Mr. Boddy.

197
00:16:01,684 --> 00:16:02,708
Thanks.

198
00:16:04,687 --> 00:16:06,746
Take that away, honey.

199
00:16:13,662 --> 00:16:15,596
Look! I demand to know
what's going on.

200
00:16:15,664 --> 00:16:17,598
Why have we been dragged here?

201
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:21,932
Well, I believe
we all received a letter.

202
00:16:22,004 --> 00:16:23,335
My letter says,

203
00:16:23,405 --> 00:16:27,603
''It will be to your advantage
to be present.

204
00:16:27,676 --> 00:16:31,612
Mr. Boddy will end
a long-standing, confidential,

205
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,614
and painful financial liability.''

206
00:16:33,682 --> 00:16:34,979
Signed, ''A friend.''

207
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,381
I received a similar letter.

208
00:16:36,452 --> 00:16:37,646
So did we.

209
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,154
I also received a letter.

210
00:16:40,222 --> 00:16:41,655
No, thanks, Yvette.

211
00:16:41,724 --> 00:16:43,123
I just ate.

212
00:16:43,192 --> 00:16:44,784
You know her?

213
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,589
We know each other.

214
00:16:46,662 --> 00:16:47,856
Don't we, dear?

215
00:16:49,331 --> 00:16:52,767
Did your letter
say the same thing?

216
00:16:52,835 --> 00:16:53,927
No.

217
00:16:54,003 --> 00:16:55,436
I see.

218
00:16:55,504 --> 00:16:59,998
Can I interest anyone
in fruit or dessert?

219
00:17:02,444 --> 00:17:05,379
Then we'll adjourn to the study

220
00:17:05,447 --> 00:17:07,381
for coffee and brandy,

221
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:10,850
where our unknown host
will reveal his intentions.

222
00:17:13,956 --> 00:17:15,890
There's no one here.

223
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:19,894
Please help yourself to brandy
and be seated.

224
00:17:29,438 --> 00:17:31,372
Mind if I smoke?

225
00:17:50,492 --> 00:17:51,982
Ladies and gentlemen,

226
00:17:52,061 --> 00:17:55,997
I'm to explain what you have
in common with each other.

227
00:17:56,065 --> 00:17:58,727
Unless you would care to, Mr. Boddy?

228
00:17:58,801 --> 00:18:01,167
Why me?
Do they know who I am?

229
00:18:01,237 --> 00:18:03,762
No. You've never
identified yourself.

230
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:06,364
It's a hoax.
I suggest we leave.

231
00:18:06,442 --> 00:18:08,842
I'm sorry.
You cannot leave this house!

232
00:18:08,911 --> 00:18:10,276
Who'll stop me?

233
00:18:10,346 --> 00:18:12,280
There's no way out.
The windows have bars.

234
00:18:12,348 --> 00:18:14,509
The doors are locked.

235
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,847
You can't hold us prisoner!

236
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:18,284
He's right!

237
00:18:18,354 --> 00:18:20,845
Please return to the study.

238
00:18:20,923 --> 00:18:22,413
Everything will be explained.

239
00:18:23,726 --> 00:18:25,626
You, too, Mr. Boddy.

240
00:18:25,694 --> 00:18:27,161
Other way!

241
00:18:35,304 --> 00:18:37,135
You can't get out.

242
00:18:37,206 --> 00:18:38,434
It's only glass.

243
00:19:02,264 --> 00:19:05,199
You all have one thing in common.

244
00:19:05,267 --> 00:19:06,734
You're all being blackmailed.

245
00:19:06,802 --> 00:19:08,235
For some time,

246
00:19:08,304 --> 00:19:12,240
you've been paying
more than you can afford

247
00:19:12,308 --> 00:19:15,243
to someone threatening
to expose you,

248
00:19:15,311 --> 00:19:17,745
and you don't know who.

249
00:19:17,813 --> 00:19:19,246
That's ridiculous!

250
00:19:19,315 --> 00:19:21,249
Nobody could blackmail me.

251
00:19:21,317 --> 00:19:24,115
I've never done anything wrong.

252
00:19:26,155 --> 00:19:29,090
Anybody else wish to deny it?

253
00:19:33,495 --> 00:19:34,928
Very well.

254
00:19:34,997 --> 00:19:37,192
As everyone here
is in the same boat,

255
00:19:37,266 --> 00:19:40,201
I'll reveal some details,
as instructed.

256
00:19:40,269 --> 00:19:41,861
Thank you, Yvette.

257
00:19:49,178 --> 00:19:52,170
You might spare us
this humiliation.

258
00:19:52,247 --> 00:19:54,181
I'm sorry.

259
00:19:54,249 --> 00:19:56,683
Professor Plum, you were once

260
00:19:56,752 --> 00:19:58,686
a professor of psychiatry,

261
00:19:58,754 --> 00:20:00,688
specializing in homicidal lunatics

262
00:20:00,756 --> 00:20:02,690
suffering from
delusions of grandeur.

263
00:20:02,758 --> 00:20:04,692
But now I'm with
the United Nations.

264
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,695
No change.
But you don't practice medicine.

265
00:20:07,763 --> 00:20:10,197
His license to practice
has been lifted.

266
00:20:10,265 --> 00:20:12,597
What did he do?

267
00:20:12,668 --> 00:20:16,468
What doctors mustn't do
with their lady patients.

268
00:20:16,538 --> 00:20:18,563
Oh, how disgusting!

269
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,076
Are you making moral judgments,
Mrs. Peacock?

270
00:20:22,144 --> 00:20:24,578
How then do you
justify taking bribes

271
00:20:24,646 --> 00:20:27,581
in return for delivering
Senator Peacock's vote to lobbyists?

272
00:20:27,649 --> 00:20:29,082
My husband's a paid consultant.

273
00:20:29,151 --> 00:20:30,584
There's nothing wrong with that.

274
00:20:30,652 --> 00:20:32,244
Not if it's publicly declared.

275
00:20:32,321 --> 00:20:34,255
But if the payment is delivered

276
00:20:34,323 --> 00:20:35,756
by slipping used greenbacks

277
00:20:35,824 --> 00:20:38,258
under the door of the men's room,

278
00:20:38,327 --> 00:20:39,760
how would you describe that?

279
00:20:39,828 --> 00:20:41,159
I'd say it stinks.

280
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,993
How would you know?

281
00:20:43,065 --> 00:20:44,396
So it's true?

282
00:20:44,466 --> 00:20:46,900
No. It's a vicious lie!

283
00:20:46,969 --> 00:20:50,405
You've been paying blackmail
for over a year

284
00:20:50,472 --> 00:20:53,407
to keep that story
out of the papers.

285
00:20:53,475 --> 00:20:55,909
I believe you.
I'm being blackmailed

286
00:20:55,978 --> 00:20:57,843
for something I didn't do.

287
00:20:57,913 --> 00:20:59,346
- Me, too.
- And me.

288
00:20:59,415 --> 00:21:00,848
Not me.

289
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,281
You're not?

290
00:21:02,351 --> 00:21:05,218
I did what I'm being
blackmailed for.

291
00:21:05,287 --> 00:21:06,720
What did you do?

292
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:08,222
To be perfectly frank,

293
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:10,224
I run a hotel which provides

294
00:21:10,292 --> 00:21:12,817
gentlemen with the company
of a young lady

295
00:21:12,895 --> 00:21:14,453
for a short while.

296
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:15,997
Oh, yeah?

297
00:21:16,064 --> 00:21:17,998
What's the phone number?

298
00:21:19,134 --> 00:21:22,570
Was Colonel Mustard
one of your clients?

299
00:21:22,638 --> 00:21:25,072
Tell them that's not true.

300
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,505
It's not true.

301
00:21:26,575 --> 00:21:27,507
Really?

302
00:21:27,576 --> 00:21:28,508
No.

303
00:21:28,577 --> 00:21:30,807
Aha! A double negative.

304
00:21:30,879 --> 00:21:32,676
Do you have photographs?

305
00:21:32,748 --> 00:21:35,182
That sounds like a confession.

306
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,343
You gave yourself away.

307
00:21:37,419 --> 00:21:39,979
Are you trying to
make me look stupid?

308
00:21:40,055 --> 00:21:41,317
You don't need help.

309
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:43,085
That's right!

310
00:21:43,158 --> 00:21:46,093
What's so terrible
about Colonel Mustard

311
00:21:46,161 --> 00:21:49,096
visiting a house of ill fame?

312
00:21:49,164 --> 00:21:53,362
He holds a sensitive security post
in the Pentagon.

313
00:21:53,435 --> 00:21:57,428
You drive an expensive car
for a colonel.

314
00:21:57,506 --> 00:21:59,940
I came into money during the war

315
00:22:00,008 --> 00:22:02,203
when I lost my mommy and daddy.

316
00:22:03,612 --> 00:22:04,544
Mrs. White,

317
00:22:04,613 --> 00:22:06,342
you've paid the blackmailer

318
00:22:06,415 --> 00:22:09,714
ever since your husband
died mysteriously.

319
00:22:11,587 --> 00:22:12,952
Why is that funny?

320
00:22:13,021 --> 00:22:16,548
That's why he was
lying on his back.

321
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:18,217
I didn't kill him.

322
00:22:18,293 --> 00:22:19,954
Then why are you
paying the blackmailer?

323
00:22:20,028 --> 00:22:22,053
I don't want a scandal.

324
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:24,064
We had a humiliating confrontation.

325
00:22:24,132 --> 00:22:25,565
He was deranged.

326
00:22:25,634 --> 00:22:27,261
He was a lunatic.

327
00:22:27,336 --> 00:22:29,236
He didn't like me.

328
00:22:29,304 --> 00:22:32,034
He threatened
to kill me in public.

329
00:22:32,107 --> 00:22:33,540
Why kill you in public?

330
00:22:33,609 --> 00:22:36,077
He threatened in public
to kill her.

331
00:22:36,144 --> 00:22:38,738
Oh. Was that his final word?

332
00:22:38,814 --> 00:22:41,214
Being killed
is pretty final, right?

333
00:22:41,283 --> 00:22:44,741
He was the one
who died, not you.

334
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,412
What was his profession?

335
00:22:46,488 --> 00:22:48,922
He was a scientist.
Nuclear physics.

336
00:22:48,991 --> 00:22:50,754
What was he like?

337
00:22:50,826 --> 00:22:53,260
He was always
a stupidly optimistic man.

338
00:22:53,328 --> 00:22:57,264
It was a shock
to him when he died.

339
00:22:57,332 --> 00:22:59,766
His head had been cut off.

340
00:22:59,835 --> 00:23:01,769
And so had his, uh...

341
00:23:01,837 --> 00:23:03,361
you know.

342
00:23:03,438 --> 00:23:05,872
I had been out all evening.

343
00:23:05,941 --> 00:23:08,000
Do you miss him?

344
00:23:08,076 --> 00:23:11,910
Now that he's dead,
I have a life.

345
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,379
He was your second husband.

346
00:23:13,448 --> 00:23:15,382
Your first husband also disappeared.

347
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:17,418
He was an illusionist.

348
00:23:17,486 --> 00:23:19,147
But he never reappeared.

349
00:23:19,221 --> 00:23:21,348
He wasn't a very good illusionist.

350
00:23:22,791 --> 00:23:24,691
I have something to say.

351
00:23:26,194 --> 00:23:29,721
I won't wait for Wadsworth
to unmask me.

352
00:23:29,798 --> 00:23:32,232
I work for the State Department,

353
00:23:32,301 --> 00:23:33,529
and I'm a homosexual.

354
00:23:36,939 --> 00:23:40,238
I feel no shame
or guilt about this,

355
00:23:40,309 --> 00:23:43,745
but I must keep it a secret

356
00:23:43,812 --> 00:23:47,248
or I'll lose my job
on security grounds.

357
00:23:47,316 --> 00:23:48,749
Thank you.

358
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,253
Well...

359
00:23:54,957 --> 00:23:57,824
that just leaves Mr. Boddy.

360
00:23:57,893 --> 00:23:59,258
What's your secret?

361
00:23:59,328 --> 00:24:00,761
Haven't you guessed?

362
00:24:00,829 --> 00:24:02,854
He's the one blackmailing you.

363
00:24:04,399 --> 00:24:05,866
You bastard!

364
00:24:05,934 --> 00:24:07,367
Put 'em up!

365
00:24:07,436 --> 00:24:08,698
Put 'em up!

366
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:11,000
Gentlemen...

367
00:24:11,073 --> 00:24:13,041
if you can't fight fairly,

368
00:24:13,108 --> 00:24:15,201
don't fight at all.

369
00:24:15,277 --> 00:24:17,711
Nobody calls me a bastard!

370
00:24:19,281 --> 00:24:21,215
Was that necessary,
Mrs. White?

371
00:24:21,283 --> 00:24:22,511
Wait, wait!

372
00:24:22,584 --> 00:24:24,552
The police are coming.

373
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,588
- No, no!
- Oh, no!

374
00:24:26,655 --> 00:24:28,213
Listen!

375
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:30,224
Blackmail depends on secrecy.

376
00:24:30,292 --> 00:24:32,226
You've admitted
he's blackmailed you.

377
00:24:32,294 --> 00:24:35,730
Tell the police,
and he'll be convicted.

378
00:24:35,797 --> 00:24:37,458
It's not so easy.

379
00:24:39,401 --> 00:24:41,232
You'll never tell the police.

380
00:24:41,303 --> 00:24:42,736
Then I shall.

381
00:24:42,804 --> 00:24:46,399
This conversation
is being tape recorded.

382
00:24:46,475 --> 00:24:47,942
<i>Point of order!</i>

383
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:50,240
<i>Tape recordings aren't</i>
<i>admissible evidence.</i>

384
00:24:50,312 --> 00:24:53,247
The police arrive in 45 minutes.

385
00:24:53,315 --> 00:24:55,715
Tell them the truth,

386
00:24:55,784 --> 00:24:59,481
and Mr. Boddy will be behind bars.

387
00:24:59,554 --> 00:25:01,249
Where are you going?

388
00:25:01,323 --> 00:25:03,188
I can help them decide.

389
00:25:03,258 --> 00:25:05,123
Can I get my bag?

390
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:17,705
Who can guess what's in here?

391
00:25:17,773 --> 00:25:20,207
The evidence against us, no doubt.

392
00:25:20,275 --> 00:25:23,039
Did you know you were meeting us?

393
00:25:23,111 --> 00:25:24,203
Yes.

394
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:26,474
What were you told, precisely?

395
00:25:26,548 --> 00:25:29,711
That you were meeting
to discuss our arrangements.

396
00:25:29,785 --> 00:25:31,719
If I didn't appear,

397
00:25:31,787 --> 00:25:33,721
Wadsworth would inform the police.

398
00:25:33,789 --> 00:25:35,723
I could hardly resist

399
00:25:35,791 --> 00:25:37,725
putting in an appearance.

400
00:25:39,294 --> 00:25:41,660
Excuse me.

401
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:43,755
Open them.

402
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,733
Why not?

403
00:25:48,804 --> 00:25:52,740
I enjoy getting presents
from strange men.

404
00:26:01,316 --> 00:26:03,181
A candlestick?

405
00:26:03,251 --> 00:26:05,185
What's this for?

406
00:26:50,465 --> 00:26:52,228
In your hands,

407
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,666
you each have a lethal weapon.

408
00:26:56,805 --> 00:26:59,740
If you denounce me to the police,

409
00:26:59,808 --> 00:27:02,675
you will also be
exposed and humiliated.

410
00:27:02,744 --> 00:27:05,679
I'll see to that in court.

411
00:27:07,249 --> 00:27:08,682
But...

412
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:11,583
if one of you
kills Wadsworth now,

413
00:27:11,653 --> 00:27:16,181
no one but the seven
of us will ever know.

414
00:27:16,258 --> 00:27:19,694
He has the key
to the front door,

415
00:27:19,761 --> 00:27:22,696
which he said
would only be opened

416
00:27:22,764 --> 00:27:24,322
over his dead body.

417
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:32,206
I suggest we take him up
on that offer.

418
00:27:37,779 --> 00:27:41,715
To avoid finding yourselves
on the front pages,

419
00:27:41,783 --> 00:27:45,048
one of you better
kill Wadsworth...now.

420
00:27:46,121 --> 00:27:47,554
[Thump]

421
00:27:47,622 --> 00:27:49,214
[Moan]

422
00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:50,724
[Gunshot]

423
00:27:50,792 --> 00:27:52,225
Aaahh!

424
00:27:56,031 --> 00:27:57,191
It's not Wadsworth!

425
00:27:57,265 --> 00:27:58,857
Is he alive?

426
00:27:58,934 --> 00:27:59,866
Mr. Boddy.

427
00:27:59,935 --> 00:28:01,402
Stand back!

428
00:28:01,469 --> 00:28:02,834
Let me see.

429
00:28:09,244 --> 00:28:10,677
He's dead!

430
00:28:10,745 --> 00:28:12,178
Who had the gun?

431
00:28:12,247 --> 00:28:13,680
I did.

432
00:28:13,748 --> 00:28:15,181
You shot him!

433
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:16,182
I didn't!

434
00:28:16,251 --> 00:28:18,685
If you didn't shoot him,
who did?

435
00:28:19,754 --> 00:28:21,813
Nobody!
There's no gunshot wound.

436
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:25,189
Somebody grabbed the gun,
and it went off.

437
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,694
Look!
The bullet broke that vase.

438
00:28:27,762 --> 00:28:28,694
Excuse me.

439
00:28:28,763 --> 00:28:30,196
He's absolutely right.

440
00:28:30,265 --> 00:28:32,199
There's a bullet hole.

441
00:28:32,267 --> 00:28:34,701
How did he die?

442
00:28:34,769 --> 00:28:36,202
I don't know!

443
00:28:36,271 --> 00:28:38,705
I'm not a forensic expert!

444
00:28:38,773 --> 00:28:41,207
Someone here must have killed him.

445
00:28:41,276 --> 00:28:42,709
I didn't do it.

446
00:28:42,777 --> 00:28:44,711
I need a drink.

447
00:28:47,782 --> 00:28:49,750
Maybe he was poisoned.

448
00:28:49,818 --> 00:28:52,912
Aah!

449
00:28:52,988 --> 00:28:54,717
Aah!

450
00:28:54,789 --> 00:28:56,723
Mrs. Peacock, it's all right.

451
00:28:56,791 --> 00:28:58,725
We don't know anything.

452
00:28:58,793 --> 00:29:00,954
Sit down.
Sit down.

453
00:29:02,464 --> 00:29:05,524
I had to stop her
from screaming.

454
00:29:07,002 --> 00:29:08,993
Was the brandy poisoned?

455
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,503
I don't know.

456
00:29:13,241 --> 00:29:15,175
Looks like we'll never know.

457
00:29:15,243 --> 00:29:16,676
Unless...

458
00:29:16,745 --> 00:29:18,679
unless she dies, too.

459
00:29:23,752 --> 00:29:25,845
Aah!

460
00:29:27,756 --> 00:29:30,350
Aah!

461
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,693
Aah!

462
00:29:35,263 --> 00:29:36,696
It's locked.

463
00:29:36,765 --> 00:29:38,198
Open up.

464
00:29:38,266 --> 00:29:39,699
It's the murderer!

465
00:29:39,768 --> 00:29:41,201
He's got Yvette!

466
00:29:41,269 --> 00:29:43,100
Oh, my God!

467
00:29:46,274 --> 00:29:48,105
You're alive.

468
00:29:48,176 --> 00:29:49,609
No thanks to you.

469
00:29:49,678 --> 00:29:51,805
There's a murderer here.

470
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,711
The murderer's in this room?

471
00:29:53,782 --> 00:29:55,147
But where?

472
00:29:55,216 --> 00:29:56,808
Where? Here.

473
00:29:56,885 --> 00:29:59,911
We're looking at him...or her!

474
00:29:59,988 --> 00:30:02,149
Like Mrs. White said,

475
00:30:02,223 --> 00:30:03,713
somebody here is a killer!

476
00:30:03,792 --> 00:30:05,350
How did you know?

477
00:30:05,427 --> 00:30:06,587
I was listening.

478
00:30:06,661 --> 00:30:09,755
Why were you screaming
all by yourself?

479
00:30:09,831 --> 00:30:11,731
Because I am frightened.

480
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,734
I also drink the cognac.

481
00:30:13,802 --> 00:30:16,202
I can't stay here by myself.

482
00:30:17,806 --> 00:30:20,741
Come back to the study with us.

483
00:30:20,809 --> 00:30:22,242
With the murderer?

484
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:24,744
There's safety in numbers, my dear.

485
00:30:38,827 --> 00:30:41,762
There's no indication
of how he died?

486
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:43,263
No.

487
00:30:43,331 --> 00:30:44,764
This is absolutely terrible.

488
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:46,767
It's not what I'd intended.

489
00:30:46,835 --> 00:30:47,995
My God!

490
00:30:48,069 --> 00:30:49,468
Not what you intended?

491
00:30:49,537 --> 00:30:51,437
You're not the butler?

492
00:30:51,506 --> 00:30:52,996
I'm not <i>the</i> butler,

493
00:30:53,074 --> 00:30:55,338
but I am a butler, <i>his</i> butler.

494
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:59,176
If he told you to invite us,
why was he late?

495
00:30:59,247 --> 00:31:01,272
I invited you.
I wrote the letters.

496
00:31:01,349 --> 00:31:03,214
It was all my idea.

497
00:31:03,284 --> 00:31:04,717
Wait a minute.

498
00:31:04,786 --> 00:31:06,720
I--I don't understand.

499
00:31:06,788 --> 00:31:09,723
Were you assisting
your late employer

500
00:31:09,791 --> 00:31:11,281
to blackmail us?

501
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:12,724
Certainly not!

502
00:31:12,794 --> 00:31:14,955
I think you'd better explain.

503
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:17,225
Please sit down, everyone.

504
00:31:36,818 --> 00:31:40,254
When I said I was
Mr. Boddy's butler,

505
00:31:40,321 --> 00:31:41,754
this was misleading.

506
00:31:41,823 --> 00:31:43,757
I was once his butler,

507
00:31:43,825 --> 00:31:47,090
but his death didn't
end my employment.

508
00:31:47,162 --> 00:31:48,629
What did end it?

509
00:31:48,696 --> 00:31:50,755
When my wife decided to...

510
00:31:50,832 --> 00:31:52,265
end her life.

511
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:54,267
She, too, was being blackmailed

512
00:31:54,335 --> 00:31:56,269
by this odious man.

513
00:31:56,337 --> 00:31:58,271
He hated my wife

514
00:31:58,339 --> 00:32:01,274
for the same reason
he hated all of you--

515
00:32:01,342 --> 00:32:04,175
He believed you were
thoroughly un-American.

516
00:32:07,782 --> 00:32:09,249
I'm sorry.

517
00:32:09,317 --> 00:32:11,217
He felt it was inappropriate

518
00:32:11,286 --> 00:32:14,722
for a senator
to have a corrupt wife,

519
00:32:14,789 --> 00:32:17,724
for a doctor
to abuse his patients,

520
00:32:17,792 --> 00:32:20,226
for a wife
to emasculate her husband,

521
00:32:20,295 --> 00:32:21,819
and--and...so forth.

522
00:32:21,896 --> 00:32:26,060
If he was so patriotic,
why didn't he report us?

523
00:32:26,134 --> 00:32:29,228
He decided to make a little money.

524
00:32:29,304 --> 00:32:32,330
What could be
more American than that?

525
00:32:32,407 --> 00:32:33,840
What was your role?

526
00:32:33,908 --> 00:32:36,240
I was a victim, too.

527
00:32:36,311 --> 00:32:38,745
At least, my wife was.

528
00:32:38,813 --> 00:32:41,247
She had friends who were...

529
00:32:42,817 --> 00:32:44,478
socialists.

530
00:32:44,552 --> 00:32:46,747
Oh, my God.

531
00:32:50,825 --> 00:32:52,258
Well...

532
00:32:52,327 --> 00:32:54,227
we all make mistakes.

533
00:33:04,272 --> 00:33:06,206
Mr. Boddy threatened
to turn her in

534
00:33:06,274 --> 00:33:08,208
unless she named the socialists.

535
00:33:08,276 --> 00:33:10,710
She refused, so he blackmailed her.

536
00:33:10,778 --> 00:33:12,712
The price of his silence

537
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:16,682
was that we work for him for nothing.
We were slaves.

538
00:33:16,751 --> 00:33:19,515
To make a long story short...

539
00:33:19,587 --> 00:33:21,418
Too late.

540
00:33:21,489 --> 00:33:23,218
my wife's suicide
preyed on my mind

541
00:33:23,291 --> 00:33:26,727
and created a sense
of injustice in me.

542
00:33:26,794 --> 00:33:30,230
I resolved to put Mr. Boddy
behind bars.

543
00:33:30,298 --> 00:33:33,734
The best way to do this and
free you from blackmail

544
00:33:33,801 --> 00:33:36,736
was to get everyone
face to face,

545
00:33:36,804 --> 00:33:39,238
confront Mr. Boddy
with his crimes,

546
00:33:39,307 --> 00:33:41,070
and turn him in.

547
00:33:41,142 --> 00:33:42,439
Everything's explained.

548
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:43,909
Nothing's explained.

549
00:33:43,978 --> 00:33:46,412
We don't know
who killed him.

550
00:33:46,481 --> 00:33:48,415
We've got to find out
in 39 minutes

551
00:33:48,483 --> 00:33:49,916
before the police arrive.

552
00:33:49,984 --> 00:33:52,612
We can't have them come now.

553
00:33:52,687 --> 00:33:54,746
Which of you did it?

554
00:33:54,822 --> 00:33:56,756
What do you mean, ''you''?

555
00:33:56,824 --> 00:33:58,758
Well, I didn't do it!

556
00:33:58,826 --> 00:34:01,454
One of us did.
We all had a motive.

557
00:34:01,529 --> 00:34:03,087
Great!
We'll all get the chair.

558
00:34:03,164 --> 00:34:05,132
- Maybe it wasn't us!
- Who else?

559
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,690
Who else is here?

560
00:34:06,768 --> 00:34:08,702
- Only the cook!
- Only the cook!

561
00:34:38,299 --> 00:34:41,666
Well, she's not here.

562
00:34:41,736 --> 00:34:43,727
Aah!

563
00:34:45,306 --> 00:34:47,240
I didn't do it!

564
00:34:47,308 --> 00:34:49,242
Somebody help me, please.

565
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:51,244
Somebody help me, please.

566
00:34:57,819 --> 00:34:59,252
Don't touch it.

567
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,753
That's evidence.

568
00:35:00,822 --> 00:35:02,687
Not for us.

569
00:35:02,757 --> 00:35:04,691
We can't take fingerprints.

570
00:35:04,759 --> 00:35:06,693
Explain yourself, Wadsworth.

571
00:35:06,761 --> 00:35:08,058
Me? Why me?

572
00:35:08,129 --> 00:35:09,687
Why kill the cook?

573
00:35:09,764 --> 00:35:11,197
Dinner wasn't that bad.

574
00:35:11,266 --> 00:35:13,200
How can you make jokes?

575
00:35:13,268 --> 00:35:14,929
It's my defense mechanism.

576
00:35:15,003 --> 00:35:18,564
If I was the killer,
I'd kill you next.

577
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,508
I said <i>if.</i>

578
00:35:24,045 --> 00:35:26,036
There's one admitted killer here.

579
00:35:26,114 --> 00:35:27,547
It is her.

580
00:35:27,615 --> 00:35:29,048
I've admitted nothing.

581
00:35:29,117 --> 00:35:31,551
How many husbands
have you had?

582
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:33,052
Mine or other women's?

583
00:35:33,121 --> 00:35:34,053
Yours.

584
00:35:34,122 --> 00:35:35,384
Just the five.

585
00:35:35,456 --> 00:35:37,390
Husbands should be like Kleenex--

586
00:35:37,458 --> 00:35:38,823
soft, strong, and disposable.

587
00:35:38,893 --> 00:35:41,828
You're like a spider luring flies.

588
00:35:41,896 --> 00:35:44,729
Flies are where men
are most vulnerable.

589
00:35:44,799 --> 00:35:47,734
If it wasn't you,
who was it?

590
00:35:47,802 --> 00:35:49,235
Who had the dagger?

591
00:35:49,304 --> 00:35:50,737
You, Mrs. Peacock.

592
00:35:50,805 --> 00:35:54,241
Yes. I put it down
in the study.

593
00:35:54,309 --> 00:35:55,401
When?

594
00:35:55,476 --> 00:35:57,410
Before...or after I fainted.

595
00:35:57,478 --> 00:36:00,914
Any of you could
have picked it up.

596
00:36:00,982 --> 00:36:05,351
I suggest we take the cook's body
into the study.

597
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,512
Why?

598
00:36:06,587 --> 00:36:10,023
Butlers like keeping
the kitchen tidy.

599
00:36:16,264 --> 00:36:17,697
Look!

600
00:36:17,765 --> 00:36:19,858
The body's gone!

601
00:36:19,934 --> 00:36:22,095
- What are you staring at?
- Nothing.

602
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:24,104
- Well, who's there?
- Nobody.

603
00:36:24,172 --> 00:36:25,605
What do you mean?

604
00:36:25,673 --> 00:36:27,868
I mean no body.
Boddy's body's gone.

605
00:36:27,942 --> 00:36:29,239
He was dead!

606
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:31,244
We should've made sure.

607
00:36:31,312 --> 00:36:34,110
How?
By cutting his head off?

608
00:36:34,182 --> 00:36:36,582
We'd better look for him.

609
00:36:47,895 --> 00:36:49,328
Well.

610
00:36:49,397 --> 00:36:51,831
He couldn't have been dead.

611
00:36:51,899 --> 00:36:55,335
He was.
At least, I thought he was.

612
00:36:55,403 --> 00:36:57,894
What difference
does it make now?

613
00:36:57,972 --> 00:36:59,940
Makes a difference to him.

614
00:37:00,007 --> 00:37:02,840
Maybe there is life after death.

615
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:04,844
Life after death's as improbable

616
00:37:04,912 --> 00:37:07,073
as sex after marriage.

617
00:37:07,148 --> 00:37:10,345
Maybe Mr. Boddy killed the cook!

618
00:37:10,418 --> 00:37:11,350
- Yes!
- Yes!

619
00:37:11,419 --> 00:37:13,011
How?

620
00:37:13,087 --> 00:37:14,111
Uh...

621
00:37:18,726 --> 00:37:20,523
Excuse me.
I have to...

622
00:37:20,595 --> 00:37:24,361
Is there a little girl's room
in the hall?

623
00:37:24,432 --> 00:37:25,865
<i>Oui, oui, madame.</i>

624
00:37:25,933 --> 00:37:29,369
No, I just want to
powder my nose.

625
00:37:31,072 --> 00:37:32,369
What's this, Wadsworth?

626
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,876
The negatives to which
Colonel Mustard earlier referred.

627
00:37:35,943 --> 00:37:38,377
You planning to
blackmail him, Wadsworth?

628
00:37:38,446 --> 00:37:42,382
No! I planned on
returning them to the colonel

629
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:44,384
when Mr. Boddy was unmasked.

630
00:37:44,452 --> 00:37:48,183
Very pretty.
Want to see these, Yvette?

631
00:37:48,256 --> 00:37:50,053
No. I am a lady.

632
00:37:50,124 --> 00:37:52,058
What sort of pictures?

633
00:37:52,126 --> 00:37:55,061
They're my pictures.
I'd like them back.

634
00:37:55,129 --> 00:37:57,563
No. Something in them
concerns me.

635
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:59,065
Let me see.

636
00:37:59,133 --> 00:38:02,000
Nobody can get
into that position.

637
00:38:02,069 --> 00:38:03,502
Sure they can.

638
00:38:03,571 --> 00:38:05,505
Let me show you.

639
00:38:05,573 --> 00:38:07,234
Get off me.

640
00:38:07,308 --> 00:38:09,833
Aah!

641
00:38:15,683 --> 00:38:16,980
It's Mr. Boddy!

642
00:38:17,051 --> 00:38:19,349
He's attacking her.

643
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,512
Aah!

644
00:38:23,424 --> 00:38:25,358
No. No, he's dead.

645
00:38:25,426 --> 00:38:27,792
Mr. Boddy. Dead...again!

646
00:38:27,862 --> 00:38:29,090
Oh, my God.

647
00:38:29,163 --> 00:38:30,596
She's fainting.

648
00:38:30,665 --> 00:38:32,098
Somebody catch her!

649
00:38:32,166 --> 00:38:33,827
I'll catch her.

650
00:38:35,736 --> 00:38:36,828
Sorry.

651
00:38:36,904 --> 00:38:38,269
You've got blood
on your hands.

652
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,640
I didn't do it!

653
00:38:42,743 --> 00:38:44,574
He's certainly dead now.

654
00:38:44,645 --> 00:38:48,479
Why would anyone
want to kill him twice?

655
00:38:48,549 --> 00:38:49,880
Seems so unnecessary.

656
00:38:49,951 --> 00:38:52,249
What we call overkill.

657
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,151
Unless he wasn't dead before.

658
00:38:54,222 --> 00:38:55,655
What's the difference?

659
00:38:55,723 --> 00:38:58,157
That's what we're trying
to find out--

660
00:38:58,226 --> 00:39:00,660
who killed him, where,
and with what!

661
00:39:00,728 --> 00:39:02,457
No need to shout!

662
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:04,794
I'm not shouting!

663
00:39:04,866 --> 00:39:06,800
All right, I am!

664
00:39:06,868 --> 00:39:09,769
I'm shouting!
I'm shouting! I'm shou--

665
00:39:20,381 --> 00:39:23,544
Okay, put the corpses on the sofa.

666
00:39:24,619 --> 00:39:26,018
Ladies first.

667
00:39:37,665 --> 00:39:40,532
Careful.
Don't get blood on the sofa.

668
00:39:40,601 --> 00:39:42,535
How do we do this?

669
00:39:42,603 --> 00:39:45,367
Tip her forward over the arm.

670
00:39:50,845 --> 00:39:51,903
Now Mr. Boddy.

671
00:39:54,415 --> 00:39:55,473
Ready.

672
00:39:58,419 --> 00:39:59,852
A little higher.

673
00:39:59,921 --> 00:40:01,320
There we go.

674
00:40:05,426 --> 00:40:06,358
Now.

675
00:40:06,427 --> 00:40:07,485
Who...

676
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:11,364
Who had access
to the candlestick?

677
00:40:11,432 --> 00:40:12,364
Everybody.

678
00:40:12,433 --> 00:40:14,367
It was given to you.

679
00:40:14,435 --> 00:40:15,868
I dropped it.

680
00:40:15,937 --> 00:40:17,871
Anyone could've picked it up.

681
00:40:17,939 --> 00:40:19,873
We still have these weapons--

682
00:40:19,941 --> 00:40:22,375
the gun, rope, wrench, lead pipe.

683
00:40:22,443 --> 00:40:25,879
Let's put them in this cupboard
and lock it.

684
00:40:25,947 --> 00:40:28,108
There's a homicidal maniac about.

685
00:40:28,182 --> 00:40:29,706
- Good idea.
- Good idea.

686
00:40:29,784 --> 00:40:33,880
I'm putting the key
in my pocket for safety.

687
00:40:33,955 --> 00:40:36,890
You can open it
whenever you want.

688
00:40:36,958 --> 00:40:38,926
What if you're the murderer?

689
00:40:38,993 --> 00:40:40,426
I'm not.

690
00:40:40,494 --> 00:40:43,827
If I've got it,
I know I'm safe.

691
00:40:43,898 --> 00:40:45,991
We don't know that we are.

692
00:40:46,067 --> 00:40:48,001
We'll throw it away.

693
00:40:48,069 --> 00:40:49,502
Good idea!

694
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:50,764
- Wonderful!
- Right away!

695
00:40:55,977 --> 00:40:57,001
Sorry.

696
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,607
Sorry.

697
00:41:00,681 --> 00:41:02,080
Can we help?

698
00:41:02,149 --> 00:41:05,050
I didn't mean
to disturb the household.

699
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:07,053
My car broke down.

700
00:41:07,121 --> 00:41:10,989
I was wondering
if I could use your phone.

701
00:41:11,058 --> 00:41:12,457
Just a moment.

702
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:17,830
[Whispering]

703
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:27,373
Very well, sir.

704
00:41:27,441 --> 00:41:29,500
Would you care to come in?

705
00:41:30,945 --> 00:41:32,378
Where is it?

706
00:41:32,446 --> 00:41:33,879
What, the body?

707
00:41:33,948 --> 00:41:35,381
The phone. What body?

708
00:41:35,449 --> 00:41:37,883
There's nobody... in the study,

709
00:41:37,952 --> 00:41:40,887
But there's a phone
in the lounge.

710
00:41:40,955 --> 00:41:42,354
Thank you.

711
00:41:48,963 --> 00:41:52,899
When you're finished,
be good enough to wait here.

712
00:41:52,967 --> 00:41:54,525
Certainly.

713
00:42:03,344 --> 00:42:04,572
[Door Locks]

714
00:42:06,747 --> 00:42:07,839
Aah!

715
00:42:07,915 --> 00:42:09,348
Where's the key?

716
00:42:09,417 --> 00:42:10,850
In my pocket.

717
00:42:10,918 --> 00:42:12,180
The cupboard key.

718
00:42:12,253 --> 00:42:14,414
Should I still dispose of it?

719
00:42:14,488 --> 00:42:15,420
- Yes!
- Yes!

720
00:42:28,436 --> 00:42:29,869
Well...

721
00:42:29,937 --> 00:42:31,370
what now?

722
00:42:31,439 --> 00:42:32,872
Let me out.

723
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:35,374
No. We're all
in this together.

724
00:42:35,443 --> 00:42:36,876
If you leave,

725
00:42:36,944 --> 00:42:39,378
I'll say you killed
them both.

726
00:42:39,447 --> 00:42:40,880
- Me, too.
- Me, too.

727
00:42:40,948 --> 00:42:42,882
You'll pay for this.

728
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:44,884
One day, when we're alone--

729
00:42:44,952 --> 00:42:48,479
No sensible man
would be alone with you.

730
00:42:48,556 --> 00:42:50,490
I could use a drink.

731
00:42:50,558 --> 00:42:51,991
So could I.

732
00:42:52,059 --> 00:42:53,492
Just checking.

733
00:42:53,561 --> 00:42:54,994
Everything all right?

734
00:42:55,062 --> 00:42:57,394
Yep. Two corpses.
Everything's fine.

735
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,693
Anybody else want a whiskey?

736
00:43:01,769 --> 00:43:02,633
Yeah.

737
00:43:04,138 --> 00:43:05,571
All right, look.

738
00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:07,038
Pay attention, everybody.

739
00:43:08,909 --> 00:43:12,345
There's nobody else
in this house, correct?

740
00:43:12,413 --> 00:43:13,345
No.

741
00:43:13,414 --> 00:43:15,848
Then there is someone else here?

742
00:43:15,916 --> 00:43:17,850
I said ''no'' meaning yes.

743
00:43:17,918 --> 00:43:19,852
I want a straight answer.

744
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,686
Is there someone else,
yes or no?

745
00:43:23,758 --> 00:43:24,850
Uh, no.

746
00:43:24,925 --> 00:43:26,756
No, there is, or isn't?

747
00:43:26,827 --> 00:43:27,919
Yes.

748
00:43:27,995 --> 00:43:30,088
Please!

749
00:43:30,164 --> 00:43:34,897
Shouldn't we get that man
out of the house?

750
00:43:34,969 --> 00:43:37,904
How can we throw him out
in this weather?

751
00:43:37,972 --> 00:43:39,906
He may get suspicious.

752
00:43:39,974 --> 00:43:42,238
Throw him out,
he'll get more suspicious.

753
00:43:42,309 --> 00:43:45,745
If I were him,
I'd be suspicious already.

754
00:43:45,813 --> 00:43:49,749
Let him stay locked up for
another half hour.

755
00:43:49,817 --> 00:43:52,752
The police will be here by then,

756
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:56,312
and there are two dead bodies
in the study!

757
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:57,721
- Shh!
- Shh!

758
00:43:57,792 --> 00:43:59,123
There's still some confusion

759
00:43:59,193 --> 00:44:01,127
about whether there's anybody else here.

760
00:44:01,195 --> 00:44:02,093
There isn't.

761
00:44:02,163 --> 00:44:03,596
Confusion or anybody else?

762
00:44:03,664 --> 00:44:04,596
Either.

763
00:44:04,665 --> 00:44:06,098
Give me a clear answer.

764
00:44:06,167 --> 00:44:07,600
What was the question?

765
00:44:07,668 --> 00:44:09,932
Is anybody else in the house?

766
00:44:10,004 --> 00:44:11,028
- No!
- No!

767
00:44:11,105 --> 00:44:14,597
That's what he says,
but does he know?

768
00:44:14,675 --> 00:44:16,609
I suggest we handle this

769
00:44:16,677 --> 00:44:18,611
in proper military fashion.

770
00:44:18,679 --> 00:44:21,477
We split up and
search the house.

771
00:44:21,549 --> 00:44:22,607
Split up?

772
00:44:22,683 --> 00:44:26,346
Yes. We have little time,
so we'll split up into pairs.

773
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:29,856
Pairs? Suppose one of us
is the murderer.

774
00:44:29,924 --> 00:44:33,416
Whoever's left with the killer
might get killed!

775
00:44:33,494 --> 00:44:35,428
Then we'll discover
the murderer.

776
00:44:35,496 --> 00:44:38,522
But the other half of the pair
would be dead!

777
00:44:38,599 --> 00:44:40,066
Casualties are inevitable.

778
00:44:40,134 --> 00:44:42,068
You cannot make an omelet

779
00:44:42,136 --> 00:44:43,569
without breaking eggs.

780
00:44:43,637 --> 00:44:46,071
Every cook will tell you that.

781
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:48,802
Look what happened to the cook.

782
00:44:48,876 --> 00:44:50,810
You're willing to chance that?

783
00:44:50,878 --> 00:44:52,539
What choice have we?

784
00:44:52,613 --> 00:44:53,841
None.

785
00:44:53,914 --> 00:44:55,711
I suppose you're right.

786
00:44:55,783 --> 00:44:57,216
It's dark upstairs.

787
00:44:57,284 --> 00:44:59,218
I'm frightened of the dark.

788
00:44:59,286 --> 00:45:01,220
Will anyone go with me?

789
00:45:01,288 --> 00:45:02,653
- I will.
- I will.

790
00:45:02,723 --> 00:45:04,156
No, thank you.

791
00:45:04,225 --> 00:45:08,127
I suggest we all draw lots
for partners.

792
00:45:28,916 --> 00:45:31,510
Ready?
The two shortest together,

793
00:45:31,585 --> 00:45:34,520
the next two shortest together.
Agreed?

794
00:45:34,588 --> 00:45:37,022
The two shortest search the cellar,

795
00:45:37,091 --> 00:45:38,991
and so on, up.

796
00:46:24,905 --> 00:46:27,305
It's you and me, honeybunch.

797
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:31,469
Oh, God.

798
00:46:43,924 --> 00:46:45,323
The cellar.

799
00:46:46,427 --> 00:46:48,861
We know what's in the study.

800
00:46:48,929 --> 00:46:51,363
We've just come
from the library.

801
00:46:51,432 --> 00:46:53,366
The stranger's in the lounge.

802
00:46:53,434 --> 00:46:56,835
Let's go look
in the billiard room again.

803
00:47:28,902 --> 00:47:32,338
Want to go up in front of me?

804
00:47:32,406 --> 00:47:33,839
Absolutely <i>non.</i>

805
00:47:33,907 --> 00:47:35,841
There's nobody up there.

806
00:47:35,909 --> 00:47:37,342
Then you go in front.

807
00:47:37,411 --> 00:47:38,810
All right.

808
00:48:01,168 --> 00:48:03,693
Well... ladies first.

809
00:48:03,771 --> 00:48:06,296
No, you--you can go first.

810
00:48:06,373 --> 00:48:07,806
No, I insist.

811
00:48:07,875 --> 00:48:10,708
You fear a fate worse than death?

812
00:48:10,778 --> 00:48:12,211
No. Death.
Isn't that enough?

813
00:48:13,881 --> 00:48:15,314
Are you going in there?

814
00:48:15,382 --> 00:48:16,815
Yes. Are you?

815
00:48:16,884 --> 00:48:17,942
Yes.

816
00:48:19,219 --> 00:48:20,311
Right.

817
00:48:20,387 --> 00:48:21,445
Right.

818
00:48:24,391 --> 00:48:27,827
I don't see
any light switches in there.

819
00:48:27,895 --> 00:48:29,328
Neither do I.

820
00:48:29,396 --> 00:48:31,330
Shall I come in with you?

821
00:48:31,398 --> 00:48:32,330
No!

822
00:48:32,399 --> 00:48:34,799
I mean...
no, thank you.

823
00:48:45,412 --> 00:48:46,845
Ladies first.

824
00:48:46,914 --> 00:48:48,313
No, thanks.

825
00:49:24,885 --> 00:49:27,820
Go on.
I'll be right behind you.

826
00:49:27,888 --> 00:49:29,822
That's why I'm nervous.

827
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:31,790
Then we go together.

828
00:49:49,243 --> 00:49:50,301
Ohh!

829
00:49:51,411 --> 00:49:52,810
Stay there.

830
00:50:01,321 --> 00:50:03,789
If there's anybody in here,

831
00:50:03,857 --> 00:50:05,290
just look out!

832
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:06,758
Are you hiding?

833
00:50:07,861 --> 00:50:09,260
I'm coming.

834
00:50:11,431 --> 00:50:12,864
What room's this?

835
00:50:12,933 --> 00:50:14,366
Search me.

836
00:50:14,434 --> 00:50:15,867
All right.

837
00:50:15,936 --> 00:50:18,336
Get your mitts off me.

838
00:50:19,439 --> 00:50:20,872
[Screech]

839
00:50:20,941 --> 00:50:21,873
Aah.

840
00:50:38,458 --> 00:50:39,857
[Gasp]

841
00:50:41,428 --> 00:50:42,918
Nobody here.

842
00:50:42,996 --> 00:50:45,157
He's behind one of those curtains.

843
00:50:46,266 --> 00:50:49,235
You look.
I'll search the kitchen.

844
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:26,160
I'm a little nervous.

845
00:52:26,233 --> 00:52:27,996
I'm in this big house,

846
00:52:28,068 --> 00:52:31,060
and I've been locked
into the lounge.

847
00:52:32,773 --> 00:52:33,831
Yes.

848
00:52:33,907 --> 00:52:36,000
The funny thing is,

849
00:52:36,076 --> 00:52:38,271
there's a group of people here

850
00:52:38,345 --> 00:52:40,006
having some party,

851
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:44,016
and one of them is
my old boss from--

852
00:53:30,397 --> 00:53:32,991
Looks like a secret passage.

853
00:53:36,069 --> 00:53:38,003
Should we see where it leads?

854
00:53:38,071 --> 00:53:39,504
What the hell.

855
00:53:39,573 --> 00:53:41,006
I'll go first.

856
00:53:41,074 --> 00:53:43,008
I've had a good life.

857
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:48,013
Aah! Oh, God!

858
00:53:48,081 --> 00:53:49,571
It's all right.

859
00:54:01,428 --> 00:54:02,793
Oh, my God!

Aah!

Aah!

Aah!

Aah!

00:54:10,537 --> 00:54:11,970
Oh, come on!

865
00:54:21,047 --> 00:54:22,480
Down here!

866
00:54:22,549 --> 00:54:24,983
Get us out of here!

867
00:54:25,051 --> 00:54:26,985
Where's it coming from?

868
00:54:27,053 --> 00:54:28,987
Where are we going?

869
00:54:29,055 --> 00:54:30,852
Where are they?

870
00:54:30,924 --> 00:54:31,856
The lounge!

871
00:54:35,061 --> 00:54:36,494
The door's locked!

872
00:54:36,563 --> 00:54:37,996
I know.

873
00:54:38,064 --> 00:54:39,497
Where's the key?

874
00:54:39,566 --> 00:54:40,999
The key's gone!

875
00:54:41,067 --> 00:54:42,500
Unlock the door!

876
00:54:42,569 --> 00:54:46,005
I can't unlock the door
without the key!

877
00:54:46,072 --> 00:54:47,630
Let us in!

878
00:54:47,707 --> 00:54:49,470
Let us out!

879
00:54:49,543 --> 00:54:51,010
Stand back.

880
00:54:51,077 --> 00:54:55,514
I'm just going to
have to break it down.

00:54:58,585 --> 00:55:00,951
I know!
I have it!

882
00:55:01,021 --> 00:55:02,249
Help!

883
00:55:02,322 --> 00:55:05,450
Shut up!
We're doing our best.

884
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:11,864
They're shooting at us.

885
00:55:19,439 --> 00:55:20,667
I've been shot.

00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:25,040
Come out.
The door is open.

00:55:25,111 --> 00:55:29,343
Why are you shooting
that thing at us?

888
00:55:29,416 --> 00:55:31,111
To get you out.

889
00:55:31,184 --> 00:55:32,617
You could've killed us.

890
00:55:32,686 --> 00:55:34,847
I could've been killed!

891
00:55:34,921 --> 00:55:36,513
I can't take any more scares.

892
00:55:43,363 --> 00:55:44,796
But look!

893
00:55:47,133 --> 00:55:50,068
Which one of you did it?

894
00:55:50,136 --> 00:55:52,070
We found him together.

895
00:55:52,138 --> 00:55:54,072
How did you get in?

896
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:55,573
The door was locked.

897
00:55:55,642 --> 00:55:57,132
There's a secret passageway.

00:55:57,210 --> 00:55:59,075
Is that the same gun?

00:55:59,145 --> 00:56:00,578
From the cupboard?

900
00:56:00,647 --> 00:56:02,012
It was locked!

901
00:56:02,082 --> 00:56:04,107
It was unlocked.
See for yourself.

902
00:56:11,591 --> 00:56:14,526
How did you know
it was unlocked?

903
00:56:14,594 --> 00:56:16,027
I didn't.

904
00:56:16,096 --> 00:56:20,533
I think I would break it open.

905
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,033
A likely story.

The key.

Good evening, sir.

Yes?

00:56:55,802 --> 00:56:57,895
I found an abandoned car.

Did the driver
come here for help?

- No, no.
- No.

00:57:04,077 --> 00:57:06,011
Well, actually, yes.

There seems to be a disagreement.

00:57:19,593 --> 00:57:22,027
Use the one in the st--

928
00:57:22,095 --> 00:57:23,528
No.

929
00:57:24,831 --> 00:57:27,026
Please wait in the, um...

930
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:29,330
In the um, uh, library.

931
00:57:29,402 --> 00:57:30,869
Sure.

932
00:57:36,109 --> 00:57:39,044
Don't I know you from someplace?

933
00:57:41,114 --> 00:57:43,548
You're all anxious
about something.

934
00:57:43,617 --> 00:57:46,552
The chandelier fell
and almost killed us.

935
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:49,054
Would you come this way?

936
00:57:56,463 --> 00:57:59,296
Frightfully drafty, these old houses.

937
00:58:03,069 --> 00:58:07,096
Help yourself to a drink.

938
00:58:07,173 --> 00:58:08,970
Not the cognac, just in case.

939
00:58:09,042 --> 00:58:10,873
In case of what?

940
00:58:15,915 --> 00:58:17,507
What now?

941
00:58:17,584 --> 00:58:19,017
[Knock On Door]

942
00:58:20,754 --> 00:58:22,346
We should've told him.

943
00:58:22,422 --> 00:58:23,912
Now you say it?

944
00:58:23,990 --> 00:58:25,423
Shut up!

945
00:58:25,492 --> 00:58:26,925
Let's clean this up.

946
00:58:35,735 --> 00:58:37,532
[Ring]

947
00:58:39,773 --> 00:58:41,331
Hello.

948
00:58:41,408 --> 00:58:44,275
Maybe the cop answered it.

949
00:58:44,344 --> 00:58:46,244
Who's calling?

950
00:58:49,115 --> 00:58:51,549
Would you hold on, please?

951
00:58:55,622 --> 00:58:58,056
Let me out of here!

952
00:58:58,124 --> 00:59:01,059
I'll book you for false arrest

953
00:59:01,127 --> 00:59:02,492
and wrongful imprisonment

954
00:59:02,562 --> 00:59:04,325
and obstructing an officer

955
00:59:04,397 --> 00:59:07,264
in the course of his duty

956
00:59:07,333 --> 00:59:08,766
and murder!

957
00:59:10,904 --> 00:59:14,032
What do you mean, murder?

958
00:59:14,107 --> 00:59:18,441
I said it
so you would open the door.

959
00:59:18,511 --> 00:59:20,502
Why would you lock me in?

960
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:23,208
Why's J. Edgar Hoover on the phone?

961
00:59:23,283 --> 00:59:25,774
J. Edgar Hoover?

962
00:59:25,852 --> 00:59:28,582
The head of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

963
00:59:28,655 --> 00:59:30,714
Why is J. Edgar Hoover on your phone?

964
00:59:30,790 --> 00:59:35,284
He's on everybody else's.
Why not on mine?

965
00:59:41,301 --> 00:59:42,734
What's going on?

966
00:59:42,802 --> 00:59:44,326
We're having a party.

967
00:59:47,273 --> 00:59:49,571
Mind if I look around?

968
00:59:49,642 --> 00:59:50,609
Sure.

969
00:59:53,213 --> 00:59:54,703
Show him around, Mr. Green.

970
00:59:54,781 --> 00:59:55,907
Me?

971
00:59:55,982 --> 00:59:58,746
Show him the dining room,

972
00:59:58,818 --> 01:00:01,082
the kitchen, the ballroom.

973
01:00:01,154 --> 01:00:02,883
Fine.

974
01:00:04,624 --> 01:00:06,683
Officer, come with me.

975
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:09,695
I'll show you the dining room

976
01:00:09,763 --> 01:00:11,196
or the kitchen

977
01:00:11,264 --> 01:00:12,629
or the ballroom.

978
01:00:17,003 --> 01:00:18,800
Make it look convincing.

979
01:00:20,273 --> 01:00:23,208
So, this is the dining room.

980
01:00:23,276 --> 01:00:24,470
No kidding?

981
01:00:24,544 --> 01:00:26,136
Come on!

982
01:00:26,212 --> 01:00:29,204
What's going on
in those two rooms?

983
01:00:29,282 --> 01:00:30,544
Which two rooms?

984
01:00:35,288 --> 01:00:36,721
Those two rooms.

985
01:00:36,790 --> 01:00:38,724
Oh, those two rooms.

986
01:00:38,792 --> 01:00:40,157
Yes!

987
01:00:42,295 --> 01:00:44,729
You shouldn't go in there.

988
01:00:44,798 --> 01:00:46,163
Why not?

989
01:00:48,635 --> 01:00:51,001
Because it's all too shocking.

990
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:19,692
It's not all
that shocking.

991
01:01:19,766 --> 01:01:23,258
These folks are just
having a good time.

992
01:01:31,778 --> 01:01:33,143
Oh, my God.

993
01:01:37,050 --> 01:01:38,415
Excuse me.

994
01:01:40,286 --> 01:01:41,480
Oh!

995
01:01:50,296 --> 01:01:51,888
This man's drunk.

996
01:01:51,965 --> 01:01:53,728
Dead drunk.

997
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,427
Dead right.

998
01:01:55,501 --> 01:01:58,095
You're not driving home,
are you?

999
01:01:58,171 --> 01:01:59,570
He won't be driving.

1000
01:01:59,639 --> 01:02:01,004
I promise you.

1001
01:02:01,074 --> 01:02:02,837
Somebody will drive him?

1002
01:02:02,909 --> 01:02:04,809
We'll get him a car.

1003
01:02:04,878 --> 01:02:06,311
A long black car.

1004
01:02:06,379 --> 01:02:07,812
A limousine.

1005
01:02:07,881 --> 01:02:09,644
Oh!

1006
01:02:17,757 --> 01:02:19,019
Officer.

1007
01:02:19,092 --> 01:02:20,923
I've seen it all.

1008
01:02:20,994 --> 01:02:23,019
I can explain everything.

1009
01:02:23,096 --> 01:02:24,791
You don't have to.

1010
01:02:24,864 --> 01:02:26,923
There's nothing illegal.

1011
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,058
Really?

1012
01:02:28,134 --> 01:02:29,795
Yes. This is America.

1013
01:02:29,869 --> 01:02:32,702
It's a free country.

1014
01:02:32,772 --> 01:02:35,707
I didn't know
it was that free.

1015
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:38,039
May I use your phone now?

1016
01:02:38,111 --> 01:02:39,635
Certainly.

1017
01:02:49,122 --> 01:02:50,714
Why did you lock him in again?

1018
01:02:52,125 --> 01:02:54,719
We're still searching the house.

1019
01:02:54,794 --> 01:02:57,729
Only 1 5 minutes
before the police come.

1020
01:02:57,797 --> 01:02:59,230
The police already came!

1021
01:02:59,299 --> 01:03:01,233
Let's get on with it.

1022
01:03:01,301 --> 01:03:02,666
Monsieur.

1023
01:03:29,996 --> 01:03:31,588
Oh! Look.

1024
01:03:31,664 --> 01:03:33,757
I can't believe it.

1025
01:03:33,833 --> 01:03:36,097
I wonder where
this one goes.

1026
01:03:36,169 --> 01:03:37,534
Let's find out.

1027
01:03:57,090 --> 01:03:58,557
Let's try the ballroom again.

1028
01:04:24,817 --> 01:04:26,079
Aah!

1029
01:04:26,152 --> 01:04:27,813
Don't you touch me!

1030
01:04:33,092 --> 01:04:34,024
Aah!

1031
01:04:34,093 --> 01:04:35,060
Aah!

1032
01:04:35,128 --> 01:04:37,119
Aah!

1033
01:04:37,196 --> 01:04:40,029
Aah!

1034
01:04:42,201 --> 01:04:44,669
Hello? Hello?

1035
01:04:44,737 --> 01:04:46,261
[Whispering]
Shut the door.

1036
01:04:46,339 --> 01:04:48,273
Did anyone recognize you?

1037
01:04:48,341 --> 01:04:49,774
They must have,

1038
01:04:49,842 --> 01:04:52,276
and not just my face.

1039
01:04:52,345 --> 01:04:55,781
They know every inch of my body,

1040
01:04:55,848 --> 01:04:58,783
and they're not the only ones.

1041
01:04:58,851 --> 01:05:00,216
It's you!

1042
01:05:03,856 --> 01:05:06,222
Something funny's going on here.

1043
01:05:06,292 --> 01:05:08,624
I don't know what it is.

1044
01:05:11,497 --> 01:05:13,727
No, I'm not on duty,

1045
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:17,531
but I have a feeling
that I'm in danger.

1046
01:05:17,603 --> 01:05:20,436
You know that big ugly house--

1047
01:05:20,506 --> 01:05:22,599
Hello?

1048
01:05:22,675 --> 01:05:23,767
Hello?

1049
01:05:26,179 --> 01:05:27,578
Are you there?

1050
01:05:49,669 --> 01:05:50,863
Aah!

1051
01:05:50,937 --> 01:05:52,768
I'm coming!

1052
01:05:52,839 --> 01:05:54,932
I'm trying to find the door.

1053
01:05:55,007 --> 01:05:56,406
Help me!

1054
01:05:56,476 --> 01:05:58,171
Coming!

1055
01:05:58,244 --> 01:05:59,575
What's this?

1056
01:05:59,645 --> 01:06:01,374
Another door?

1057
01:07:12,185 --> 01:07:13,550
Two murders.

1058
01:07:21,194 --> 01:07:23,128
Neither of them shot.

1059
01:07:23,196 --> 01:07:24,629
I heard a gun.

1060
01:07:24,697 --> 01:07:26,130
So did I.

1061
01:07:26,199 --> 01:07:28,633
I heard the front door slam.

1062
01:07:28,701 --> 01:07:30,464
The murderer must've run out.

1063
01:07:35,208 --> 01:07:37,540
Three murders?

1064
01:07:37,610 --> 01:07:39,578
Six all together.

1065
01:07:39,645 --> 01:07:41,704
This is getting serious.

1066
01:07:51,224 --> 01:07:54,682
No gun.
Yvette dropped it here.

1067
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:58,196
Very well, I know who did it.

1068
01:07:58,264 --> 01:07:59,663
You do?

1069
01:07:59,732 --> 01:08:02,599
Furthermore,
I'll tell you how it was done.

1070
01:08:02,668 --> 01:08:03,965
Follow me.

1071
01:08:07,907 --> 01:08:11,104
I shall take you through
the events of the evening

1072
01:08:11,177 --> 01:08:12,610
step-by-step.

1073
01:08:12,678 --> 01:08:15,112
At the start of the evening,

1074
01:08:15,181 --> 01:08:17,115
Yvette was here by herself,

1075
01:08:17,183 --> 01:08:20,619
waiting to offer you
a glass of champagne.

1076
01:08:20,686 --> 01:08:23,120
I was in the hall.

1077
01:08:23,189 --> 01:08:26,124
I know because I was there.

1078
01:08:26,192 --> 01:08:29,491
Then I hurried across
to the kitchen.

1079
01:08:32,064 --> 01:08:34,624
The cook was in here alive,

1080
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:36,133
sharpening knives.

1081
01:08:36,202 --> 01:08:37,533
And then...

1082
01:08:39,038 --> 01:08:40,562
the doorbell rang.

1083
01:08:42,008 --> 01:08:44,238
And it was you.

1084
01:08:44,310 --> 01:08:47,143
I recognized you as Colonel Mustard.

1085
01:08:47,213 --> 01:08:49,647
I prevented you
from telling your name.

1086
01:08:49,715 --> 01:08:52,149
I wanted you to use your pseudonym.

1087
01:08:52,218 --> 01:08:55,278
I ran across to the library.

1088
01:08:55,354 --> 01:08:57,151
Yvette met you and smiled

1089
01:08:57,223 --> 01:08:59,418
and poured you a drink.

1090
01:09:02,061 --> 01:09:03,426
The doorbell rang.

1091
01:09:03,496 --> 01:09:06,363
It was Mrs. White
looking pale and tragic.

1092
01:09:06,432 --> 01:09:08,093
And I took her coat and hung it up.

1093
01:09:08,167 --> 01:09:10,601
I introduced Mrs. White
to Colonel Mustard.

1094
01:09:10,670 --> 01:09:12,103
Hello. Hello.

1095
01:09:12,171 --> 01:09:15,265
I noticed that Mrs. White
and Yvette flinched.

1096
01:09:15,341 --> 01:09:17,605
There was thunder and lightning.

1097
01:09:17,677 --> 01:09:20,441
To make a long story short--

1098
01:09:20,513 --> 01:09:21,810
Too late!

1099
01:09:21,881 --> 01:09:23,644
you all arrived.

1100
01:09:23,716 --> 01:09:25,616
The gong struck the cook.

1101
01:09:25,685 --> 01:09:28,279
We went into the dining room.

1102
01:09:28,354 --> 01:09:30,117
Mrs. Peacock sat here.

1103
01:09:30,189 --> 01:09:31,622
Professor Plum sat here.

1104
01:09:31,691 --> 01:09:33,124
Mrs. White sat here.

1105
01:09:33,192 --> 01:09:35,786
Mr. Green, Miss Scarlet,
Colonel Mustard.

1106
01:09:35,861 --> 01:09:37,556
This chair was vacant.

1107
01:09:37,630 --> 01:09:41,396
We all revealed
we'd received a letter.

1108
01:09:41,467 --> 01:09:42,900
Get on with it!

1109
01:09:42,968 --> 01:09:44,629
The point is... blackmail!

1110
01:09:44,704 --> 01:09:47,969
This came out
after dinner in the study.

1111
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:49,234
You're right!

1112
01:09:51,844 --> 01:09:53,641
Mr. Green stood here.

1113
01:09:53,713 --> 01:09:55,146
Mrs. Peacock here.

1114
01:09:55,214 --> 01:09:56,647
Miss Scarlet here.

1115
01:09:56,716 --> 01:09:58,149
Professor Plum here.

1116
01:09:58,217 --> 01:10:00,151
Colonel Mustard and Mrs. White.

1117
01:10:00,219 --> 01:10:01,652
Get on with it!

1118
01:10:01,721 --> 01:10:04,554
Mr. Boddy went to get
the surprise packages.

1119
01:10:04,623 --> 01:10:06,090
You opened your presents.

1120
01:10:06,158 --> 01:10:08,319
Mr. Boddy switched off the lights.

1121
01:10:08,394 --> 01:10:11,261
- Aah! Aah!
- Aah!

1122
01:10:13,899 --> 01:10:15,332
Oh, grand.

1123
01:10:15,401 --> 01:10:18,393
Mr. Boddy lay on the floor
apparently dead.

1124
01:10:18,471 --> 01:10:20,336
He was dead!

1125
01:10:20,406 --> 01:10:23,967
He was bashed later on the head.

1126
01:10:24,043 --> 01:10:25,533
Okay, I made a mistake.

1127
01:10:25,611 --> 01:10:28,876
Why was Mr. Boddy
pretending to be dead?

1128
01:10:28,948 --> 01:10:31,849
He realized his scheme had misfired,

1129
01:10:31,917 --> 01:10:34,852
and the gunshot was intended for him.

1130
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:37,855
Look. The bullet grazed his ear.

1131
01:10:37,923 --> 01:10:40,357
To escape death,
he pretended to be dead.

1132
01:10:40,426 --> 01:10:43,395
The gunman tried to kill him.

1133
01:10:43,462 --> 01:10:45,362
But remember what happened next.

1134
01:10:45,431 --> 01:10:47,865
Mrs. Peacock took a drink.

1135
01:10:47,933 --> 01:10:49,867
You said, ''Maybe it's poisoned.''

1136
01:10:49,935 --> 01:10:51,368
She screams. Aah!

1137
01:10:51,437 --> 01:10:54,372
We took her to the sofa.

1138
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:55,930
Mr. Green...

1139
01:10:56,008 --> 01:10:59,876
Well, I had to stop her screaming.

1140
01:10:59,945 --> 01:11:01,378
Then, more screaming.

1141
01:11:01,447 --> 01:11:02,812
Yvette!
The billiard room!

1142
01:11:02,882 --> 01:11:04,213
We all rushed out.

1143
01:11:06,519 --> 01:11:08,919
One of us wasn't here. No.

1144
01:11:08,988 --> 01:11:09,955
- No?
- No?

1145
01:11:10,022 --> 01:11:12,820
Maybe one of us
was murdering the cook.

1146
01:11:12,892 --> 01:11:14,416
Who wasn't here with us?

1147
01:11:14,493 --> 01:11:16,586
Do you know?

1148
01:11:16,662 --> 01:11:17,924
I do.

1149
01:11:17,997 --> 01:11:19,191
While we stood here,

1150
01:11:19,265 --> 01:11:21,597
trying to stop Yvette from panicking,

1151
01:11:21,667 --> 01:11:23,635
someone could've stayed in here,

1152
01:11:23,702 --> 01:11:24,964
picked up the dagger,

1153
01:11:25,037 --> 01:11:27,801
run down the hall,

1154
01:11:27,873 --> 01:11:29,431
and stabbed the cook!

1155
01:11:29,508 --> 01:11:32,409
We might've seen
him running back.

1156
01:11:32,478 --> 01:11:35,242
Not if they used this secret passage.

1157
01:11:35,314 --> 01:11:38,545
He ran down this to the study.

1158
01:11:38,617 --> 01:11:40,380
That's where it comes out?

1159
01:11:40,453 --> 01:11:41,385
Yes!

1160
01:11:43,389 --> 01:11:44,378
What?

1161
01:11:44,457 --> 01:11:45,822
How did you know?

1162
01:11:45,891 --> 01:11:47,916
I've known all along.

1163
01:11:47,993 --> 01:11:49,984
You could be the murderer.

1164
01:11:50,062 --> 01:11:53,293
Ridiculous. If I was,
would I reveal how I did it?

1165
01:11:53,365 --> 01:11:56,892
Well, who else knew
about the secret passage?

1166
01:11:56,969 --> 01:11:58,903
We found it, Mustard and me.

1167
01:11:58,971 --> 01:12:00,734
You found it.
You could've known.

1168
01:12:00,806 --> 01:12:01,830
I didn't.

1169
01:12:01,907 --> 01:12:03,340
Why should we believe you?

1170
01:12:03,409 --> 01:12:07,436
Because she was with us
in the billiard room.

1171
01:12:07,513 --> 01:12:09,310
Why was the cook murdered?

1172
01:12:09,381 --> 01:12:12,009
She had nothing to do with Mr. Boddy.

1173
01:12:12,084 --> 01:12:13,608
Of course she did.

1174
01:12:13,686 --> 01:12:15,119
I gathered you here

1175
01:12:15,187 --> 01:12:18,623
because you were all implicated
in Mr. Boddy's blackmail.

1176
01:12:18,691 --> 01:12:21,819
Didn't anyone deduce
the others were involved, too?

1177
01:12:23,062 --> 01:12:24,188
What others?

1178
01:12:24,263 --> 01:12:25,696
The cook and Yvette.

1179
01:12:25,764 --> 01:12:26,696
No.

1180
01:12:26,765 --> 01:12:29,199
That's how he got
his information.

1181
01:12:29,268 --> 01:12:30,530
Before blackmailing anyone,

1182
01:12:30,603 --> 01:12:33,367
Mr. Boddy had to discover
their guilty secret.

1183
01:12:33,439 --> 01:12:35,669
The cook and Yvette
were his accomplices.

1184
01:12:35,741 --> 01:12:37,003
I see.

1185
01:12:37,076 --> 01:12:39,476
So whoever knew...

1186
01:12:39,545 --> 01:12:42,605
that the cook was involved...
killed her?

1187
01:12:42,681 --> 01:12:43,909
Yes.

1188
01:12:43,983 --> 01:12:47,043
I know, because I was
Mr. Boddy's butler,

1189
01:12:47,119 --> 01:12:50,020
that the cook had worked
for one of you.

1190
01:12:50,089 --> 01:12:51,181
Who?

1191
01:12:51,257 --> 01:12:52,519
You recognized Yvette.

1192
01:12:52,591 --> 01:12:53,888
Don't deny it.

1193
01:12:53,959 --> 01:12:55,392
What do you mean?

1194
01:12:55,461 --> 01:12:56,894
I'm not denying anything.

1195
01:12:56,962 --> 01:12:58,224
Another denial.

1196
01:12:58,297 --> 01:12:59,730
Okay, I knew Yvette.

1197
01:12:59,798 --> 01:13:02,733
My husband had an affair with her,

1198
01:13:02,801 --> 01:13:04,735
but I didn't care.

1199
01:13:04,803 --> 01:13:06,236
You knew Yvette, too.

1200
01:13:06,305 --> 01:13:07,567
She worked for me.

1201
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:08,902
You, also, sir.

1202
01:13:08,974 --> 01:13:10,305
We've already established

1203
01:13:10,376 --> 01:13:12,810
that you were one
of Miss Scarlet's clients.

1204
01:13:12,878 --> 01:13:15,142
That's why you wanted
those negatives--

1205
01:13:15,214 --> 01:13:18,877
photographs of you and Yvette
in flagrante delicto.

1206
01:13:18,951 --> 01:13:22,478
Boddy threatened to send them
to my mother,

1207
01:13:22,555 --> 01:13:23,988
which would've killed her.

1208
01:13:24,056 --> 01:13:25,489
That would've been an achievement,

1209
01:13:25,558 --> 01:13:27,321
since you said she's dead already.

1210
01:13:27,393 --> 01:13:29,224
So, he had the motive.

1211
01:13:29,295 --> 01:13:30,819
You all did.

1212
01:13:30,896 --> 01:13:32,955
Where was Mr. Boddy killed?

1213
01:13:33,032 --> 01:13:35,432
Don't you see? Look.

1214
01:13:35,501 --> 01:13:37,059
We returned to the study.

1215
01:13:37,136 --> 01:13:39,570
Mr. Boddy was pretending to be dead,

1216
01:13:39,638 --> 01:13:41,401
but someone knows he's alive.

1217
01:13:41,473 --> 01:13:44,408
I explained
that I'd invited you here.

1218
01:13:44,476 --> 01:13:47,741
We realized only
one other person was here.

1219
01:13:47,813 --> 01:13:49,178
The cook!

1220
01:13:56,422 --> 01:13:59,186
Well, where is he?

1221
01:13:59,258 --> 01:14:01,419
Aah!

1222
01:14:04,930 --> 01:14:06,693
By now she was dead.

1223
01:14:06,765 --> 01:14:08,198
We laid her down.

1224
01:14:08,267 --> 01:14:11,031
Someone slipped through
the same secret passage.

1225
01:14:11,103 --> 01:14:12,195
Again?

1226
01:14:12,271 --> 01:14:14,762
Of course.
Back to the study.

1227
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:16,899
The murderer was in
the secret passage.

1228
01:14:16,976 --> 01:14:19,740
Meanwhile, Mr. Boddy
had been on the floor.

1229
01:14:19,812 --> 01:14:21,245
He jumped up.

1230
01:14:21,313 --> 01:14:24,248
The murderer came out of here,

1231
01:14:24,316 --> 01:14:26,477
picked up the candlestick.

1232
01:14:26,552 --> 01:14:28,611
Mr. Boddy followed us into here,

1233
01:14:28,687 --> 01:14:30,621
looking for an escape.

1234
01:14:30,689 --> 01:14:31,951
The murderer crept up...

1235
01:14:32,024 --> 01:14:33,457
and killed him!

1236
01:14:33,525 --> 01:14:35,459
Will you stop that?

1237
01:14:35,527 --> 01:14:37,188
No.

1238
01:14:37,262 --> 01:14:40,129
Then he threw him into the toilet

1239
01:14:40,199 --> 01:14:42,463
and rejoined us in the kitchen.

1240
01:14:42,534 --> 01:14:45,799
Who wasn't in the kitchen
the entire time?

1241
01:14:45,871 --> 01:14:48,305
Whoever it was is the murderer.

1242
01:14:48,374 --> 01:14:49,739
[Toilet Flushing]

1243
01:14:51,410 --> 01:14:53,241
We locked the weapons up

1244
01:14:53,312 --> 01:14:55,576
and ran to the front door...

1245
01:14:55,648 --> 01:14:58,173
to throw away the key.

1246
01:14:58,250 --> 01:15:00,514
The motorist!
I didn't throw it.

1247
01:15:00,586 --> 01:15:02,952
I put it in my pocket.

1248
01:15:03,022 --> 01:15:04,284
Someone could've removed it

1249
01:15:04,356 --> 01:15:05,618
and substituted another.

1250
01:15:05,691 --> 01:15:07,955
We were all in a huddle.

1251
01:15:08,027 --> 01:15:09,289
Anyone could've done that.

1252
01:15:09,361 --> 01:15:10,760
Wait a minute.

1253
01:15:12,164 --> 01:15:15,463
Colonel Mustard
has a top-secret Pentagon job.

1254
01:15:15,534 --> 01:15:18,901
Mrs. White's husband was
a nuclear physicist, and...

1255
01:15:20,372 --> 01:15:23,864
Yvette is a link between them.

1256
01:15:23,942 --> 01:15:25,910
What's your top-secret job?

1257
01:15:25,978 --> 01:15:27,912
He's working on the secret

1258
01:15:27,980 --> 01:15:30,642
of the next fusion bomb.

1259
01:15:30,716 --> 01:15:32,013
How did you know?

1260
01:15:32,084 --> 01:15:34,985
Can you keep a secret?
So can I.

1261
01:15:35,054 --> 01:15:38,546
Is this a plot,
or did Mustard do it alone?

1262
01:15:38,624 --> 01:15:39,989
We shall see.

1263
01:15:40,059 --> 01:15:43,324
Bad luck that motorist
arrived at that moment.

1264
01:15:43,395 --> 01:15:45,488
Not luck. I invited him.

1265
01:15:45,564 --> 01:15:46,758
You did?

1266
01:15:46,832 --> 01:15:49,596
Everyone here was
Mr. Boddy's victim or accomplice.

1267
01:15:49,668 --> 01:15:53,934
Everyone who's died gave him
information about one of you.

1268
01:15:54,006 --> 01:15:55,439
I got them here

1269
01:15:55,507 --> 01:15:58,203
so they'd give evidence
against him.

1270
01:15:58,277 --> 01:15:59,801
What about that motorist?

1271
01:15:59,878 --> 01:16:01,641
What information did he have?

1272
01:16:01,714 --> 01:16:04,615
He was my driver during the war.

1273
01:16:04,683 --> 01:16:07,117
What was he holding over you?

1274
01:16:07,186 --> 01:16:10,622
He knew that I was a war profiteer.

1275
01:16:10,689 --> 01:16:13,954
I stole essential
air force radio parts,

1276
01:16:14,026 --> 01:16:17,291
and I sold them
on the black market.

1277
01:16:17,362 --> 01:16:19,626
That's how I made all my money.

1278
01:16:19,698 --> 01:16:22,223
But that doesn't make me a murderer.

1279
01:16:22,301 --> 01:16:24,326
A lot of our airmen died

1280
01:16:24,403 --> 01:16:26,564
because their radios didn't work.

1281
01:16:26,638 --> 01:16:29,539
Was the policeman working
for Mr. Boddy, too?

1282
01:16:29,608 --> 01:16:31,371
The cop was from Washington.

1283
01:16:31,443 --> 01:16:33,206
He was on my payroll.

1284
01:16:33,278 --> 01:16:36,543
I bribed him
so I could carry on with business.

1285
01:16:36,615 --> 01:16:37,877
Mr. Boddy found out.

1286
01:16:37,950 --> 01:16:39,383
Oh, my God!

1287
01:16:39,451 --> 01:16:42,284
Oh, please.

1288
01:16:42,354 --> 01:16:44,481
And the singing telegram girl?

1289
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:50,494
She was my patient once.

1290
01:16:50,562 --> 01:16:53,190
I had an affair with her.

1291
01:16:53,265 --> 01:16:55,665
That's how I lost my license.

1292
01:16:55,734 --> 01:16:57,998
Mr. Boddy found that out, too.

1293
01:16:58,070 --> 01:17:01,335
Well, let's put her in the study.

1294
01:17:03,342 --> 01:17:04,331
So...

1295
01:17:04,409 --> 01:17:06,809
now you all know why they died.

1296
01:17:06,879 --> 01:17:08,403
Whoever killed Mr. Boddy

1297
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,243
also wanted his accomplices dead.

1298
01:17:10,315 --> 01:17:12,806
How did the murderer
know about them?

1299
01:17:12,885 --> 01:17:17,447
I'd guessed that this young singer
told Boddy about me.

1300
01:17:17,523 --> 01:17:20,458
I knew nothing about any of you.

1301
01:17:20,526 --> 01:17:23,461
The murderer needed
to get the weapons.

1302
01:17:23,529 --> 01:17:24,962
He stole the key.

1303
01:17:25,030 --> 01:17:26,588
We followed Mustard's suggestion

1304
01:17:26,665 --> 01:17:29,634
to split up and
search the house.

1305
01:17:29,701 --> 01:17:31,066
That's right.

1306
01:17:31,136 --> 01:17:32,899
It was Colonel Mustard's suggestion.

1307
01:17:32,971 --> 01:17:35,098
Someone got away from his partner

1308
01:17:35,174 --> 01:17:37,039
and hurried to the study.

1309
01:17:37,109 --> 01:17:39,373
On the desk was Mr. Boddy's envelope.

1310
01:17:39,444 --> 01:17:41,207
It contained photographs and letters--

1311
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:43,214
the evidence of Mr. Boddy's informants.

1312
01:17:43,282 --> 01:17:45,216
Where is the envelope now?

1313
01:17:45,284 --> 01:17:46,308
Gone.

1314
01:17:47,553 --> 01:17:48,850
Destroyed.

1315
01:17:48,921 --> 01:17:50,354
Perhaps in the fire.

1316
01:17:50,422 --> 01:17:52,754
The only possible place.

1317
01:17:55,227 --> 01:17:56,387
Aha!

1318
01:17:56,461 --> 01:17:58,895
Having found out the whole story,

1319
01:17:58,964 --> 01:18:01,228
the murderer went to the cupboard,

1320
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:03,131
took out the wrench...

1321
01:18:03,202 --> 01:18:06,535
then we found the secret passage
to the lounge,

1322
01:18:06,605 --> 01:18:08,368
where we found
the motorist dead.

1323
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:10,374
And we couldn't get in.

1324
01:18:10,442 --> 01:18:12,376
Yvette ran to the cupboard,

1325
01:18:12,444 --> 01:18:15,709
got the gun,
and shot the door open.

1326
01:18:15,781 --> 01:18:17,715
Then the doorbell rang.

1327
01:18:17,783 --> 01:18:19,375
[Doorbell Rings]

1328
01:18:19,451 --> 01:18:22,249
Whoever it is,
they've got to go away,

1329
01:18:22,321 --> 01:18:24,255
or they'll be killed.

1330
01:18:24,323 --> 01:18:26,018
Ooh!

1331
01:18:26,091 --> 01:18:28,355
Have you ever given any thought

1332
01:18:28,427 --> 01:18:30,292
to the kingdom of heaven?

1333
01:18:30,362 --> 01:18:31,329
What?

1334
01:18:31,396 --> 01:18:34,388
Repent.
The kingdom of heaven's at hand.

1335
01:18:34,466 --> 01:18:35,956
You ain't whistling <i>Dixie.</i>

1336
01:18:36,034 --> 01:18:38,127
Armageddon is almost upon us.

1337
01:18:38,203 --> 01:18:39,568
It's already here.

1338
01:18:39,638 --> 01:18:40,900
Go away!

1339
01:18:40,973 --> 01:18:42,941
Your souls are in danger.

1340
01:18:43,008 --> 01:18:44,908
Our lives are in danger!

1341
01:18:46,478 --> 01:18:47,740
The cop arrived next.

1342
01:18:47,813 --> 01:18:49,075
We locked him up.

1343
01:18:49,147 --> 01:18:51,411
We forgot the cupboard was unlocked.

1344
01:18:51,483 --> 01:18:52,745
We split up,

1345
01:18:52,818 --> 01:18:55,548
and the murderer switched off
the electricity.

1346
01:18:55,621 --> 01:18:56,883
Oh, my God!

1347
01:18:56,955 --> 01:18:58,217
Not again.

1348
01:18:58,290 --> 01:18:59,279
Turn on the lights!

1349
01:18:59,925 --> 01:19:02,257
Sorry.
Didn't mean to frighten you.

1350
01:19:02,327 --> 01:19:03,624
You're a bit late!

1351
01:19:03,695 --> 01:19:06,129
I hate when he does that.

1352
01:19:06,198 --> 01:19:08,189
Then there were
three more murders.

1353
01:19:08,267 --> 01:19:09,427
Who did it?

1354
01:19:09,501 --> 01:19:11,435
None of us killed
Mr. Boddy or the cook.

1355
01:19:11,503 --> 01:19:12,561
Who did?

1356
01:19:12,638 --> 01:19:15,106
The person who wasn't with us.

1357
01:19:16,842 --> 01:19:17,774
Yvette.

1358
01:19:17,843 --> 01:19:19,310
- Yvette?
- Yvette?

1359
01:19:19,378 --> 01:19:22,176
She was listening
to our conversation.

1360
01:19:22,247 --> 01:19:24,272
She thought he was dead.

1361
01:19:24,349 --> 01:19:26,010
While we examined
the bullet hole,

1362
01:19:26,084 --> 01:19:27,449
she got the dagger,

1363
01:19:27,519 --> 01:19:29,111
ran to the kitchen,

1364
01:19:29,187 --> 01:19:30,449
and stabbed the cook.

1365
01:19:30,522 --> 01:19:31,887
We didn't hear her scream

1366
01:19:31,957 --> 01:19:34,892
because Mrs. Peacock was screaming.

1367
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:38,396
Yvette screamed,
and we ran to her.

1368
01:19:38,463 --> 01:19:40,021
When did she kill Mr. Boddy?

1369
01:19:40,098 --> 01:19:41,360
When I said.

1370
01:19:41,433 --> 01:19:43,367
We ran to the kitchen.

1371
01:19:43,435 --> 01:19:45,869
Yvette hid to check Mr. Boddy.

1372
01:19:45,938 --> 01:19:48,338
He got up and followed them.

1373
01:19:48,407 --> 01:19:50,841
She hit him on the head

1374
01:19:50,909 --> 01:19:52,536
and dragged him to the toilet.

1375
01:19:52,611 --> 01:19:53,600
Why?

1376
01:19:53,679 --> 01:19:54,941
To create confusion.

1377
01:19:55,013 --> 01:19:56,913
It worked.

1378
01:19:56,982 --> 01:19:58,813
Why did she do it?

1379
01:19:58,884 --> 01:20:00,317
She was acting under orders

1380
01:20:00,385 --> 01:20:02,819
from the person
who later killed her.

1381
01:20:02,888 --> 01:20:03,855
- Who?
- Who?

1382
01:20:03,922 --> 01:20:04,911
Who?

1383
01:20:04,990 --> 01:20:07,982
Was it one of her clients?

1384
01:20:09,428 --> 01:20:11,862
Or was it a jealous wife?

1385
01:20:11,930 --> 01:20:13,864
Or an adulterous doctor?

1386
01:20:13,932 --> 01:20:15,900
No.

1387
01:20:15,968 --> 01:20:18,402
It was her employer, Miss Scarlet.

1388
01:20:18,470 --> 01:20:19,732
That's a lie!

1389
01:20:19,805 --> 01:20:21,238
Is it?

1390
01:20:21,306 --> 01:20:22,739
You used her.

1391
01:20:22,808 --> 01:20:24,241
You killed the motorist

1392
01:20:24,309 --> 01:20:26,743
when we split up
to search the house.

1393
01:20:26,812 --> 01:20:29,576
How could I have known
about the passage?

1394
01:20:29,648 --> 01:20:30,910
Easy. Yvette told you.

1395
01:20:30,983 --> 01:20:32,712
When we split up again,

1396
01:20:32,784 --> 01:20:34,581
you switched off the electricity.

1397
01:20:34,653 --> 01:20:38,419
It was easy for you
on the ground floor.

1398
01:20:38,490 --> 01:20:40,924
You got the rope,
strangled Yvette,

1399
01:20:40,993 --> 01:20:42,187
ran to the library,

1400
01:20:42,260 --> 01:20:43,454
killed the cop,

1401
01:20:43,528 --> 01:20:46,326
picked up the gun
where Yvette dropped it,

1402
01:20:46,398 --> 01:20:47,990
opened the front door,

1403
01:20:48,066 --> 01:20:50,864
recognized the singing telegram
from her photograph,

1404
01:20:50,936 --> 01:20:52,733
and shot her.

1405
01:20:52,804 --> 01:20:54,294
You've no proof.

1406
01:20:54,373 --> 01:20:55,772
The gun is missing.

1407
01:20:55,841 --> 01:20:57,775
Gentlemen, turn out your pockets.

1408
01:20:57,843 --> 01:20:59,640
Ladies, empty your purses.

1409
01:20:59,711 --> 01:21:04,011
Whoever has the gun
is the murderer.

1410
01:21:04,082 --> 01:21:05,709
Brilliantly worked out, Wadsworth.

1411
01:21:05,784 --> 01:21:07,046
I congratulate you.

1412
01:21:07,119 --> 01:21:08,416
Me, too.

1413
01:21:08,487 --> 01:21:09,749
Shut up!

1414
01:21:09,821 --> 01:21:11,686
I don't understand one thing.

1415
01:21:11,757 --> 01:21:13,019
One thing?

1416
01:21:13,091 --> 01:21:14,854
Why did you do it?

1417
01:21:14,926 --> 01:21:17,690
Half of Washington
knows what you do.

1418
01:21:17,763 --> 01:21:20,960
You were in no real danger.

1419
01:21:21,033 --> 01:21:23,467
They don't know my real business.

1420
01:21:23,535 --> 01:21:25,469
My business is secrets.

1421
01:21:25,537 --> 01:21:28,472
Yvette found them out for me.

1422
01:21:28,540 --> 01:21:31,475
The secrets of Senator Peacock's
defense committee,

1423
01:21:31,543 --> 01:21:34,842
of Colonel Mustard's fusion bomb,

1424
01:21:34,913 --> 01:21:37,313
Professor Plum's U.N. contacts,

1425
01:21:37,382 --> 01:21:40,545
and the work of your husband,

1426
01:21:40,619 --> 01:21:44,055
the nuclear physicist.

1427
01:21:44,122 --> 01:21:45,919
So, it is political.

1428
01:21:45,991 --> 01:21:47,356
You're a communist!

1429
01:21:47,426 --> 01:21:50,361
No, communism is
just a red herring.

1430
01:21:50,429 --> 01:21:53,193
Like all members of
the oldest profession,

1431
01:21:53,265 --> 01:21:54,562
I'm a capitalist,

1432
01:21:54,633 --> 01:21:56,760
and I'll sell my secrets--

1433
01:21:56,835 --> 01:21:58,268
your secrets--

1434
01:21:58,336 --> 01:22:00,031
to the highest bidder.

1435
01:22:00,105 --> 01:22:02,335
What if we don't cooperate?

1436
01:22:02,407 --> 01:22:05,137
You will, or I'll expose you.

1437
01:22:05,210 --> 01:22:07,178
We'll expose you. Six murders?

1438
01:22:07,245 --> 01:22:10,544
It won't enhance
your reputation at the U.N.

1439
01:22:10,615 --> 01:22:12,879
if it's revealed
you've been implicated

1440
01:22:12,951 --> 01:22:14,885
in adultery with a patient

1441
01:22:14,953 --> 01:22:18,548
and her death
and the deaths of five others.

1442
01:22:18,623 --> 01:22:21,524
I might go up in their estimation.

1443
01:22:21,593 --> 01:22:23,356
And it's no good...

1444
01:22:23,428 --> 01:22:24,861
blackmailing me, madam.

1445
01:22:24,930 --> 01:22:26,192
I have no money.

1446
01:22:26,264 --> 01:22:27,526
Neither do I.

1447
01:22:27,599 --> 01:22:29,032
I know, sweetie pie.

1448
01:22:29,101 --> 01:22:31,865
You can pay me
in government information.

1449
01:22:31,937 --> 01:22:33,302
All of you.

1450
01:22:34,439 --> 01:22:35,872
Except you, Wadsworth.

1451
01:22:35,941 --> 01:22:37,704
You as a mere butler

1452
01:22:37,776 --> 01:22:40,677
have no access
to government secrets.

1453
01:22:40,745 --> 01:22:43,680
So, I'm afraid
your moment has come.

1454
01:22:43,748 --> 01:22:45,181
Not so fast.

1455
01:22:45,250 --> 01:22:48,185
I do have a secret or two.

1456
01:22:48,253 --> 01:22:49,515
Such as?

1457
01:22:49,588 --> 01:22:50,850
The game's up.

1458
01:22:50,922 --> 01:22:52,685
There are no more bullets.

1459
01:22:52,757 --> 01:22:54,520
I won't fall for that.

1460
01:22:54,593 --> 01:22:55,855
One shot at Boddy,

1461
01:22:55,927 --> 01:22:57,360
two for the chandelier,

1462
01:22:57,429 --> 01:22:58,862
two at the lounge door,

1463
01:22:58,930 --> 01:23:00,864
and one for the singing telegram.

1464
01:23:00,932 --> 01:23:02,365
That's not six.

1465
01:23:02,434 --> 01:23:03,492
Count.

1466
01:23:03,568 --> 01:23:05,331
One shot at the chandelier.

1467
01:23:05,403 --> 01:23:08,668
That's 1 plus <i>2</i> plus 1 plus 1 .

1468
01:23:08,740 --> 01:23:12,176
No, 1 plus 1 plus <i>2</i> plus 1 .

1469
01:23:12,244 --> 01:23:15,509
Okay, 1 plus <i>2</i> plus 1 ...
Shut up!

1470
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:17,013
There's one bullet left.

1471
01:23:17,082 --> 01:23:19,277
Guess who's getting it?

1472
01:23:19,351 --> 01:23:20,409
[Ringing]

1473
01:23:20,485 --> 01:23:22,851
Ohh! Aah!

1474
01:23:30,362 --> 01:23:31,920
I'm only a guest.

1475
01:23:35,066 --> 01:23:36,499
Where's the chief?

1476
01:23:37,869 --> 01:23:39,928
Ah, Wadsworth, well done.

1477
01:23:40,005 --> 01:23:42,439
I did warn you, my dear.

1478
01:23:42,507 --> 01:23:45,442
Mr. Hoover is an expert on Armageddon.

1479
01:23:45,510 --> 01:23:48,946
Don't hate me for trying
to shoot you.

1480
01:23:49,014 --> 01:23:51,778
Frankly, Scarlet,
I don't give a damn.

1481
01:23:51,850 --> 01:23:54,011
There are no bullets left.

1482
01:23:58,190 --> 01:23:59,953
1 plus <i>2</i>...

1483
01:24:00,025 --> 01:24:01,458
plus 1 ...

1484
01:24:01,526 --> 01:24:02,993
plus <i>2</i>...

1485
01:24:03,061 --> 01:24:05,291
plus 1 is...

1486
01:24:20,245 --> 01:24:22,475
The murderer ran to the study,

1487
01:24:22,547 --> 01:24:25,482
picked up the rope
and lead pipe,

1488
01:24:25,550 --> 01:24:27,313
ran to the billiard room,

1489
01:24:27,385 --> 01:24:28,818
strangled Yvette.

1490
01:24:28,887 --> 01:24:30,149
Ran to the library,

1491
01:24:30,222 --> 01:24:33,385
hit the cop
with the lead pipe.

1492
01:24:33,458 --> 01:24:35,926
The singing telegram's
at the door.

1493
01:24:35,994 --> 01:24:38,121
The murderer got the gun,

1494
01:24:38,196 --> 01:24:39,629
opened the door,

1495
01:24:39,698 --> 01:24:41,461
recognized the girl,
shot her,

1496
01:24:41,533 --> 01:24:44,434
and ran back to the cellar.

1497
01:24:44,502 --> 01:24:47,437
But Colonel Mustard
wasn't in the cellar.

1498
01:24:47,505 --> 01:24:50,167
No...but you were.

1499
01:24:51,943 --> 01:24:53,001
So?

1500
01:24:53,078 --> 01:24:54,545
You murdered them all.

1501
01:24:54,613 --> 01:24:57,377
You were missing
during the murders,

1502
01:24:57,449 --> 01:24:59,440
and the cook was once yours.

1503
01:24:59,517 --> 01:25:02,748
Don't you remember
your fatal mistake?

1504
01:25:02,821 --> 01:25:04,311
You told us at dinner

1505
01:25:04,389 --> 01:25:07,950
we were eating
one of your favorite recipes,

1506
01:25:08,026 --> 01:25:10,460
and monkey's brains,
though popular in Cantonese cuisine,

1507
01:25:10,528 --> 01:25:12,758
are not often found
in Washington, D.C.

1508
01:25:12,831 --> 01:25:15,299
Is that what we ate?

1509
01:25:15,367 --> 01:25:17,460
Why would I murder the others?

1510
01:25:17,535 --> 01:25:19,901
In case they knew your secret.

1511
01:25:19,971 --> 01:25:22,201
So this had nothing to do

1512
01:25:22,274 --> 01:25:24,640
with the disappearing
nuclear physicist.

1513
01:25:24,709 --> 01:25:26,734
Communism was just a red herring.

1514
01:25:26,811 --> 01:25:29,712
Mrs. Peacock did it all.

1515
01:25:29,781 --> 01:25:31,112
There's no proof.

1516
01:25:31,182 --> 01:25:33,150
Well, the gun is missing.

1517
01:25:33,218 --> 01:25:35,186
Gentlemen, turn out your pockets.

1518
01:25:35,253 --> 01:25:37,016
Ladies, empty your purses.

1519
01:25:37,088 --> 01:25:39,386
Whoever has the gun...

1520
01:25:39,457 --> 01:25:41,391
is the murderer.

1521
01:25:41,459 --> 01:25:43,324
Very well.

1522
01:25:43,395 --> 01:25:46,364
What do you propose
to do about it?

1523
01:25:46,431 --> 01:25:48,365
Nothing.

1524
01:25:48,433 --> 01:25:49,866
Nothing?

1525
01:25:49,934 --> 01:25:52,198
I don't approve of murder,

1526
01:25:52,270 --> 01:25:54,534
but you've done a public service

1527
01:25:54,606 --> 01:25:57,837
by ridding it
of a blackmailer and his informers.

1528
01:25:57,909 --> 01:26:00,207
What happens when the police arrive?

1529
01:26:00,278 --> 01:26:01,711
Why should the police come?

1530
01:26:01,780 --> 01:26:03,042
Nobody's called them.

1531
01:26:03,114 --> 01:26:05,048
You mean...

1532
01:26:05,116 --> 01:26:06,276
That's right.

1533
01:26:06,351 --> 01:26:10,287
I suggest we stack
the bodies in the cellar,

1534
01:26:10,355 --> 01:26:13,290
lock it,
leave quietly one at a time,

1535
01:26:13,358 --> 01:26:15,792
and pretend this never happened.

1536
01:26:15,860 --> 01:26:17,828
Great idea.

1537
01:26:17,896 --> 01:26:20,831
I'll leave first...
if you don't mind.

1538
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:23,633
Be my guest.

1539
01:26:23,702 --> 01:26:24,634
In fact,

1540
01:26:24,703 --> 01:26:27,570
we owe you a vote of thanks.

1541
01:26:50,929 --> 01:26:53,523
I told you I didn't do it.

1542
01:26:53,598 --> 01:26:55,862
What if the authorities find out?

1543
01:26:55,934 --> 01:26:57,993
The F.B.I. will handle that.

1544
01:26:58,069 --> 01:26:59,730
My call from Mr. Hoover.

1545
01:26:59,804 --> 01:27:01,237
I work for him.

1546
01:27:01,306 --> 01:27:03,501
That's how I know about you.

1547
01:27:03,575 --> 01:27:06,009
There's one thing
I don't understand.

1548
01:27:06,077 --> 01:27:07,339
One thing?

1549
01:27:07,412 --> 01:27:10,176
Who was Mrs. Peacock
taking bribes from?

1550
01:27:10,248 --> 01:27:11,510
A foreign power.

1551
01:27:11,583 --> 01:27:13,710
Her husband controls
defense contracts.

1552
01:27:13,785 --> 01:27:14,945
There'll be a cover-up?

1553
01:27:15,019 --> 01:27:18,386
What could be gained by exposure?

1554
01:27:18,456 --> 01:27:21,357
Does the F.B.I. clean up
after multiple murder?

1555
01:27:21,426 --> 01:27:25,624
Yes. That's why it's run
by a man called Hoover.

1556
01:27:30,201 --> 01:27:31,668
Oh, Mrs. Peacock.

1557
01:27:34,205 --> 01:27:36,765
How did you know my name?

1558
01:27:36,841 --> 01:27:39,571
The kingdom of heaven is at hand.

1559
01:27:40,879 --> 01:27:42,744
Okay, take her away.

1560
01:27:44,916 --> 01:27:46,850
Take your hands off me!

1561
01:27:46,918 --> 01:27:48,783
I'm a senator's wife!

1562
01:27:50,221 --> 01:27:52,883
Wadsworth, we got her.

1563
01:27:52,957 --> 01:27:55,425
You see, it's like the Mounties.

1564
01:27:55,493 --> 01:27:57,427
We always get our man.

1565
01:27:57,495 --> 01:27:59,360
Mrs. Peacock was a man?

1566
01:28:01,232 --> 01:28:04,030
Would anyone care
for fruit or dessert?

1567
01:28:17,148 --> 01:28:19,582
Sorry, didn't mean
to frighten anyone.

1568
01:28:19,651 --> 01:28:21,141
You're too late!

1569
01:28:21,219 --> 01:28:23,119
Then there were three more murders.

1570
01:28:23,188 --> 01:28:25,383
- Who did it?
- Who did it?

1571
01:28:25,457 --> 01:28:27,948
Let's consider each murder one by one.

1572
01:28:28,026 --> 01:28:30,961
You knew Mr. Boddy was still alive.

1573
01:28:31,029 --> 01:28:33,463
Even psychiatrists
can tell the difference

1574
01:28:33,531 --> 01:28:35,795
between live and dead patients.

1575
01:28:35,867 --> 01:28:37,994
Your shot missed in the dark,

1576
01:28:38,069 --> 01:28:40,867
so you pretended he was dead

1577
01:28:40,939 --> 01:28:43,271
and killed him later, unobserved.

1578
01:28:43,341 --> 01:28:47,277
Right. He was missing
after we found the cook.

1579
01:28:47,345 --> 01:28:50,178
But he was with us
when we found Yvette.

1580
01:28:50,248 --> 01:28:52,045
How'd he kill the cook?

1581
01:28:52,116 --> 01:28:53,105
I didn't!

1582
01:28:53,184 --> 01:28:55,618
You expect us to believe that?

1583
01:28:55,687 --> 01:28:57,985
<i>You</i> should.
You killed the cook--

1584
01:28:58,056 --> 01:29:01,287
your ex-cook,
who informed on you.

1585
01:29:01,359 --> 01:29:03,486
You made one fatal mistake.

1586
01:29:03,561 --> 01:29:06,530
At dinner,
Mrs. Peacock told us she was eating

1587
01:29:06,598 --> 01:29:09,123
one of her favorite recipes.

1588
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:12,658
And monkey's brains,
though popular in Cantonese cuisine,

1589
01:29:12,737 --> 01:29:16,639
are not often to be found
in Washington, D.C.

1590
01:29:16,708 --> 01:29:20,109
Colonel Mustard,
when we saw the motorist,

1591
01:29:20,178 --> 01:29:22,738
you took the key
to the weapons cupboard,

1592
01:29:22,814 --> 01:29:26,215
then you suggested
that we all split up.

1593
01:29:26,284 --> 01:29:29,253
You crossed the hall,
took the wrench,

1594
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:31,754
ran to the conservatory,
entered the lounge,

1595
01:29:31,823 --> 01:29:34,417
killed the motorist
with a blow on the head...

1596
01:29:34,492 --> 01:29:36,016
like that!

1597
01:29:38,162 --> 01:29:39,595
This is incredible.

1598
01:29:39,664 --> 01:29:42,098
Not so incredible
as what happened next.

1599
01:29:42,166 --> 01:29:44,100
After we all split up again,

1600
01:29:44,168 --> 01:29:46,864
I went upstairs with you, Mrs. White.

1601
01:29:46,938 --> 01:29:50,305
And, while I was
in the master bedroom,

1602
01:29:50,375 --> 01:29:54,072
you hurried downstairs
and turned off the electricity,

1603
01:29:54,145 --> 01:29:57,706
got the rope
and throttled Yvette.

1604
01:29:57,782 --> 01:29:59,613
Your husband was shtupping Yvette.

1605
01:29:59,684 --> 01:30:02,118
That's why you killed him, too.

1606
01:30:02,186 --> 01:30:03,118
Yes.

1607
01:30:06,391 --> 01:30:09,326
Yes, I did it.
I killed Yvette.

1608
01:30:09,394 --> 01:30:12,830
I hated her...so...much,

1609
01:30:12,897 --> 01:30:16,333
it--it...the f--
it--flame, flames...

1610
01:30:16,401 --> 01:30:19,131
flames...on the side of my face,

1611
01:30:19,203 --> 01:30:22,764
breathing, breath--
heaving breaths,

1612
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:24,102
heaving...

1613
01:30:24,175 --> 01:30:27,838
Miss Scarlet crossed to the library

1614
01:30:27,912 --> 01:30:31,211
and hit the cop,
whom she'd been bribing,

1615
01:30:31,282 --> 01:30:32,715
with a lead pipe.

1616
01:30:32,784 --> 01:30:34,581
True or false?

1617
01:30:34,652 --> 01:30:37,644
True. Who are you, Perry Mason?

1618
01:30:37,722 --> 01:30:40,190
So, Mr. Green
shot the singing telegram.

1619
01:30:40,258 --> 01:30:41,225
I didn't!

1620
01:30:41,292 --> 01:30:42,486
Nobody's left.

1621
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:44,528
But I didn't do it!

1622
01:30:44,596 --> 01:30:48,589
The gun's missing.
Whoever's got the gun, shot the girl.

1623
01:30:48,666 --> 01:30:49,826
I shot her.

1624
01:30:49,901 --> 01:30:50,890
- You?
- You?

1625
01:30:52,437 --> 01:30:53,995
So, it <i>was</i> you.

1626
01:30:54,072 --> 01:30:55,403
I'd planned to expose you.

1627
01:30:55,473 --> 01:30:57,737
I know.
I'd rather expose myself.

1628
01:30:57,809 --> 01:30:59,743
Please.
There are ladies present.

1629
01:30:59,811 --> 01:31:02,177
You thought Mr. Boddy
was dead. Why?

1630
01:31:02,246 --> 01:31:05,181
You'd never met him until tonight.

1631
01:31:05,249 --> 01:31:06,978
You're Mr. Boddy!

1632
01:31:08,486 --> 01:31:09,817
Wait a minute!

1633
01:31:09,887 --> 01:31:11,650
So who did I kill?

1634
01:31:11,723 --> 01:31:13,816
My butler.

1635
01:31:13,891 --> 01:31:15,552
Oh, shucks.

1636
01:31:15,627 --> 01:31:17,561
He was expendable,
like all of you.

1637
01:31:17,629 --> 01:31:19,187
I'm grateful to you all

1638
01:31:19,263 --> 01:31:21,561
for disposing of my network of spies.

1639
01:31:21,633 --> 01:31:23,464
Saved me a lot of trouble.

1640
01:31:23,534 --> 01:31:25,866
Now there's no evidence against me.

1641
01:31:25,937 --> 01:31:27,905
This has nothing to do

1642
01:31:27,972 --> 01:31:30,406
with my disappearing
nuclear physicist husband

1643
01:31:30,475 --> 01:31:33,308
or Colonel Mustard's work
with the fusion bomb?

1644
01:31:33,378 --> 01:31:34,310
No.

1645
01:31:34,379 --> 01:31:36,643
Communism was just a red herring.

1646
01:31:38,650 --> 01:31:40,845
The police will be here.

1647
01:31:40,918 --> 01:31:43,352
None of you will get away with this.

1648
01:31:43,421 --> 01:31:46,151
Why should the police come?
Nobody's called them.

1649
01:31:46,224 --> 01:31:47,691
You mean...

1650
01:31:47,759 --> 01:31:48,953
Oh, of course!

1651
01:31:49,027 --> 01:31:51,587
Why shouldn't we
get away with it?

1652
01:31:51,663 --> 01:31:54,097
We'll lock the bodies in the cellar,

1653
01:31:54,165 --> 01:31:55,097
leave quietly,

1654
01:31:55,166 --> 01:31:56,827
and forget this ever happened.

1655
01:31:56,901 --> 01:31:59,995
And you'll go on blackmailing us.

1656
01:32:00,071 --> 01:32:02,062
Of course.
Why not?

1657
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:03,505
I'll tell you why not.

1658
01:32:04,809 --> 01:32:06,071
Aah!

1659
01:32:06,144 --> 01:32:08,578
Oh, good shot, Green.

1660
01:32:20,625 --> 01:32:22,991
Very good.

1661
01:32:30,935 --> 01:32:32,835
Are you a cop?

1662
01:32:32,904 --> 01:32:34,895
No. I'm a plant.

1663
01:32:34,972 --> 01:32:36,667
I thought you were a fruit.

1664
01:32:36,741 --> 01:32:38,208
Very funny.

1665
01:32:38,276 --> 01:32:41,905
F.B.I. That phone call
from J. Edgar Hoover was for me.

1666
01:32:44,182 --> 01:32:46,980
I told you I didn't do it.

1667
01:32:52,223 --> 01:32:54,214
All right, who done it?

1668
01:32:54,292 --> 01:32:56,123
- They...she did...
- That lady...he...

1669
01:32:56,194 --> 01:32:58,128
- This one... I...
- Gentlemen...

1670
01:32:58,196 --> 01:33:00,596
They all did it!

1671
01:33:00,665 --> 01:33:04,101
But if you want to know
who killed Mr. Boddy,

1672
01:33:04,168 --> 01:33:07,399
I did, in the hall,
with the revolver.

1673
01:33:07,472 --> 01:33:10,100
Okay, Chief, take them away.

1674
01:33:10,174 --> 01:33:13,200
I'm going home
and sleep with my wife.
