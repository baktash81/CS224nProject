1
00:02:49,323 --> 00:02:50,574
Come on, Doc.

2
00:03:06,718 --> 00:03:08,845
Reporting live from the home...

3
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,305
...of Dr. Richard Kimble...

4
00:03:10,431 --> 00:03:13,434
...a respected vascular surgeon at
Chicago Memorial Hospital.

5
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:15,353
Details are sketchy...

6
00:03:15,478 --> 00:03:19,858
...but we understand Dr. Kimble's wife,
Helen, was found murdered this evening.

7
00:03:19,983 --> 00:03:23,404
Area Six detectives are bringing
Dr. Kimble out.

8
00:03:23,529 --> 00:03:28,618
We assume that they're gonna be taking
him to a police station, probably Area Six...

9
00:03:28,785 --> 00:03:32,331
...where they hope he can shed some light
on what happened here this evening.

10
00:03:32,456 --> 00:03:35,293
Now, as I indicated,
she was found shortly before midnight.

11
00:03:35,418 --> 00:03:38,505
We know that she made apparently
a 911 call to police...

12
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,967
...indicating that she was
being assaulted by an intruder.

13
00:03:42,134 --> 00:03:44,011
Details are very sketchy.

14
00:03:44,136 --> 00:03:46,514
We do know that he and his wife Helen...

15
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:50,102
...were at the Four Seasons
Hotel earlier tonight...

16
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:53,022
...a fundraiser for the
Children's Research Fund.

17
00:03:56,568 --> 00:03:58,737
Rich, remember Cara?

18
00:03:59,154 --> 00:04:01,240
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

19
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,670
Straighten that arm or you're gonna slice.

20
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:14,130
Golf pro teach you that?

21
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:15,548
My wife.

22
00:04:18,635 --> 00:04:20,053
Before I forget...

23
00:04:20,387 --> 00:04:22,556
...thanks for the loaner.
Keys are downstairs.

24
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,518
- Any gas in it?
- Yes. Enough.

25
00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:27,771
Alec, Richard Kimble.

26
00:04:27,896 --> 00:04:29,898
- How are you?
- Dr. Kimble!

27
00:04:40,577 --> 00:04:41,120
Knock it off!

28
00:04:41,286 --> 00:04:44,207
There's nothing to see here.
And you, come with me.

29
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,961
Thank you.
I was just down to my last joke.

30
00:04:59,516 --> 00:05:01,602
You look really beautiful tonight.

31
00:05:02,895 --> 00:05:04,147
Thanks, honey.

32
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:08,902
I know you hate these things, but God,
I love looking at you in a tux.

33
00:05:10,028 --> 00:05:12,490
I feel I look like a waiter or something.

34
00:05:19,498 --> 00:05:21,125
- Dr. Kimble?
- Yes, it is.

35
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,001
Sorry to bother you, sir...

36
00:05:22,126 --> 00:05:26,214
...but Dr. Stevens is in Emergency
Surgery and needs your help.

37
00:05:28,258 --> 00:05:30,302
Call him back and tell him
I'll be right there.

38
00:05:30,427 --> 00:05:31,971
Thank you, Doctor.

39
00:05:32,096 --> 00:05:33,723
Thank you. Good night.

40
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,602
I'll wait up for you.

41
00:05:38,311 --> 00:05:40,272
I'll wait up for you.

42
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,724
Talk to me. What have we here?

43
00:06:10,808 --> 00:06:12,268
Thanks for coming.

44
00:06:12,727 --> 00:06:16,397
A 58-year-old.
Just pulled his gallbladder. Bleeding.

45
00:06:16,606 --> 00:06:18,400
Big time. It's in the liver bed.

46
00:06:18,525 --> 00:06:20,903
- What are his coags?
- They're all messed up.

47
00:06:20,986 --> 00:06:23,322
PT's 36 and the rest are off the wall.

48
00:06:23,781 --> 00:06:25,450
Where is he from?

49
00:06:25,575 --> 00:06:28,912
Lentz's name is on the chart.
We paged him, but no answer.

50
00:06:29,037 --> 00:06:31,916
Here guys. Let me in there.
Give me some room.

51
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:34,961
Give me a clamp.

52
00:06:35,253 --> 00:06:36,546
Give me suction.

53
00:06:36,921 --> 00:06:39,299
Have you been getting
any threats at work?

54
00:06:39,424 --> 00:06:42,386
Co-workers, hospital staff, anyone?

55
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:47,225
Anything unusual going on...

56
00:06:47,601 --> 00:06:49,728
...phone calls, people hanging up?

57
00:06:49,853 --> 00:06:52,273
Maybe people coming to the door?

58
00:06:52,565 --> 00:06:53,441
Tradespeople?

59
00:06:53,566 --> 00:06:55,360
Not that I know of.

60
00:06:55,985 --> 00:06:59,740
Back to this fight
with this guy with one arm.

61
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:02,785
Did it happen upstairs or downstairs?

62
00:07:03,494 --> 00:07:04,704
Upstairs.

63
00:07:04,996 --> 00:07:07,582
And he had which? A right or a left arm?

64
00:07:09,126 --> 00:07:11,086
With a gimmick on it?

65
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:12,838
Right arm.

66
00:07:12,963 --> 00:07:15,466
Is it one of those with the hooks, or...

67
00:07:17,761 --> 00:07:19,680
No, he had a cosmetic hand.

68
00:07:19,763 --> 00:07:23,225
The security system in your house,
it's a pretty good one.

69
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,146
Anyone else have the coding?

70
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:28,899
Our maid.

71
00:07:29,608 --> 00:07:32,027
She knows the code and has a key.

72
00:07:33,237 --> 00:07:35,365
Those scratches on your neck...

73
00:07:35,865 --> 00:07:38,034
...did the one-armed guy do that?

74
00:07:39,411 --> 00:07:41,789
Helen scratched me
when I was trying to move her.

75
00:07:41,914 --> 00:07:45,168
Before or after you had the fight
with the one-armed man?

76
00:07:46,252 --> 00:07:47,545
I told you.

77
00:07:48,088 --> 00:07:49,506
You own a gun, Doc?

78
00:07:50,966 --> 00:07:52,259
Do you own a gun?

79
00:07:54,178 --> 00:07:56,055
Yes, we have a gun in the house.

80
00:07:56,181 --> 00:07:57,766
Is it registered in your name?

81
00:07:57,891 --> 00:07:58,725
Yes.

82
00:07:59,393 --> 00:08:01,520
Where do you usually keep that gun?

83
00:08:01,729 --> 00:08:03,189
The one that you own.

84
00:08:03,356 --> 00:08:05,149
It's in Helen's table.

85
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,360
Bedside table.

86
00:08:08,236 --> 00:08:10,531
Do you keep much jewelry in the house?

87
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,203
His fingerprints are all over the lamp...

88
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,372
...the gun and the bullets...

89
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:20,793
...and the good doctor's skin
is under her fingernails.

90
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,505
She's got the money
in the family, hasn't she?

91
00:08:24,756 --> 00:08:28,051
Helen comes from a wealthy family, yes.

92
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,138
Is she insured?

93
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,350
Yes, she is.

94
00:08:35,143 --> 00:08:36,686
Who's the beneficiary?

95
00:08:40,023 --> 00:08:40,899
I am.

96
00:08:41,025 --> 00:08:43,194
The sole beneficiary?

97
00:08:44,237 --> 00:08:45,363
Yes.

98
00:08:46,281 --> 00:08:49,409
Financially, you won't be
hurting after this, will you?

99
00:08:50,953 --> 00:08:53,497
I mean, she was worth
quite a bit of money.

100
00:08:55,792 --> 00:08:58,253
Are you suggesting that I killed my wife?

101
00:08:59,129 --> 00:09:03,718
You're saying that I crushed
her skull and shot her.

102
00:09:04,469 --> 00:09:06,179
How dare you!

103
00:09:06,805 --> 00:09:09,391
When I came home,
there was a man in my house.

104
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:10,976
I fought with this man.

105
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,980
- The one-armed man.
- He had a mechanical arm.

106
00:09:14,981 --> 00:09:16,983
- Plastic? Rubber?
- You find this man!

107
00:09:17,108 --> 00:09:18,819
You find this man!

108
00:09:19,903 --> 00:09:20,863
How tall?

109
00:09:20,946 --> 00:09:22,823
He took everything from me.

110
00:09:22,948 --> 00:09:24,242
Oh, Jesus.

111
00:09:24,408 --> 00:09:25,869
What did he weigh?

112
00:09:25,994 --> 00:09:27,662
What color was his hair?

113
00:09:28,371 --> 00:09:30,249
What color were his eyes?

114
00:09:33,753 --> 00:09:36,172
We can't help you if you don't help us.

115
00:09:36,673 --> 00:09:37,716
Book him.

116
00:09:38,091 --> 00:09:39,843
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

117
00:09:39,927 --> 00:09:44,724
...you will hear iron-clad proof
of Richard Kimble's guilt.

118
00:09:46,518 --> 00:09:49,062
Indisputable scientific evidence...

119
00:09:49,187 --> 00:09:51,690
...that on the night of January 20...

120
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:54,485
...Richard Kimble did in fact viciously...

121
00:09:57,614 --> 00:09:58,865
...attack...

122
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,784
...and brutally murder his wife.

123
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:05,832
But you'll hear more than that.

124
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,668
You will hear a voice from the grave.

125
00:10:09,086 --> 00:10:12,214
The voice of Helen Kimble
identifying her killer...

126
00:10:13,132 --> 00:10:15,510
...her husband, Richard Kimble.

127
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,346
Detective Kelly...

128
00:10:18,472 --> 00:10:22,768
...tell us what you observed at the home
of the victim on the night of the murder.

129
00:10:22,852 --> 00:10:24,729
No forcible entry was found.

130
00:10:26,439 --> 00:10:30,652
From the beginning of the investigation,
it didn't appear to be a break-in.

131
00:10:30,861 --> 00:10:32,321
Nothing was missing.

132
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,993
Honey, I'm home.

133
00:10:37,577 --> 00:10:39,037
Who won the game?

134
00:10:39,621 --> 00:10:41,999
His prints were on the gun and bullets.

135
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:45,002
No other sets were found,
other than the housekeeper's...

136
00:10:45,128 --> 00:10:46,671
...and the deceased's.

137
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:53,220
Mrs. Kimble's skull fracture caused
a massive hemorrhage to the brain.

138
00:10:54,555 --> 00:10:57,309
It took less than 5 minutes for her to die.

139
00:11:13,202 --> 00:11:17,040
Your Honor, we would ask to play
Helen Kimble's 911 emergency call...

140
00:11:17,374 --> 00:11:21,253
...previously identified by a Chicago
Police Department dispatcher.

141
00:11:22,254 --> 00:11:23,631
Emergency 911.

142
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,884
Please help me.

143
00:11:26,676 --> 00:11:28,178
What's the problem?

144
00:11:30,681 --> 00:11:31,640
He's...

145
00:11:31,932 --> 00:11:34,143
He's still in the house.

146
00:11:34,435 --> 00:11:36,062
Did I hear you right?

147
00:11:36,187 --> 00:11:37,898
Someone's in your house?

148
00:11:39,816 --> 00:11:41,777
He's trying to kill me.

149
00:11:41,986 --> 00:11:43,863
Could you repeat that, please?

150
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:46,616
Ma 'am?

151
00:11:47,701 --> 00:11:49,703
He's trying to kill me.

152
00:11:52,206 --> 00:11:54,792
Is your attacker still in the house?

153
00:12:00,716 --> 00:12:01,884
Richard...

154
00:12:03,344 --> 00:12:04,804
Richard...

155
00:12:06,765 --> 00:12:08,850
Is he trying to kill me?

156
00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:19,237
Mr. Kimble...

157
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:23,576
...having considered all the factors and
aggravation and mitigation in this case...

158
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:28,373
...and found the offense was brutal
and indicative of wanton cruelty...

159
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:34,005
...it's judgment of this court, you will be
remanded to lllinois State Penitentiary...

160
00:12:34,088 --> 00:12:37,842
...where you will await
execution by lethal injection...

161
00:12:38,218 --> 00:12:42,097
...on a date to be set forth by
the Attorney General of the State.

162
00:12:42,515 --> 00:12:44,934
May God have mercy on your soul.

163
00:13:11,256 --> 00:13:12,258
- Carlson.
- Here.

164
00:13:12,383 --> 00:13:13,718
- Partida.
- Yeah.

165
00:13:14,177 --> 00:13:15,637
- Copeland.
- What?

166
00:13:16,513 --> 00:13:18,223
Copeland, you be nice now.

167
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:20,434
Kimble.

168
00:13:21,685 --> 00:13:22,770
Yeah.

169
00:13:28,777 --> 00:13:30,404
Let's go, gentlemen.

170
00:13:30,696 --> 00:13:32,656
Four prisoners coming out.

171
00:13:55,308 --> 00:13:56,810
Let's go, gentlemen.

172
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,690
Kimble, you're here.

173
00:14:03,985 --> 00:14:06,070
Carlson, right over there.

174
00:14:06,321 --> 00:14:08,365
Partida, up front left.

175
00:14:09,074 --> 00:14:11,702
Copeland, you're back here with me.

176
00:14:14,747 --> 00:14:16,958
Come on, make yourselves comfortable.

177
00:14:18,001 --> 00:14:20,170
You know the routine, gentlemen.

178
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,414
I'm tired.

179
00:14:55,002 --> 00:14:56,504
20 miles from Menard.

180
00:14:56,838 --> 00:14:58,965
We'll be there in about 40 minutes.

181
00:14:59,883 --> 00:15:03,846
I'll be glad to get rid of this load.
Let McKenzie take care of them.

182
00:15:04,764 --> 00:15:07,934
Always got some good eating there.
I'm starving.

183
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,686
Me, too.

184
00:15:10,979 --> 00:15:13,149
Had enough prison chow.

185
00:15:16,277 --> 00:15:20,073
Old Ed, he don't care.
His old lady's got him on a diet.

186
00:15:20,157 --> 00:15:21,283
Right, Ed?

187
00:15:32,296 --> 00:15:34,215
Somebody get in here, quick!

188
00:15:36,217 --> 00:15:38,637
He's getting sick! Let's go move! Move!

189
00:15:38,929 --> 00:15:41,515
- He's foaming at the mouth.
- We're almost at the prison.

190
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,767
He's choking!

191
00:15:45,937 --> 00:15:46,771
Wait!

192
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:44,589
Oh, shit!

193
00:16:48,218 --> 00:16:51,055
Kimble, get over here.
You're a doctor, do something!

194
00:16:51,138 --> 00:16:52,598
Unlock me!

195
00:16:58,605 --> 00:16:59,856
You'll be okay.

196
00:17:05,697 --> 00:17:07,198
What the hell is that?

197
00:17:11,286 --> 00:17:12,455
Shit!

198
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,294
Help me!

199
00:17:17,502 --> 00:17:18,920
The hell with you.

200
00:17:19,087 --> 00:17:20,923
Help me with this man!

201
00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:23,885
Kiss my ass, Doctor.

202
00:19:45,216 --> 00:19:46,676
Now you listen.

203
00:19:47,135 --> 00:19:49,680
I don't give a damn which way you go.

204
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:52,099
Just don't follow me. You got that?

205
00:19:56,813 --> 00:19:57,981
Be good.

206
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,904
My, my, my.

207
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,656
What a mess.

208
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,366
It's a circus.

209
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:48,415
You got my bag?

210
00:20:50,209 --> 00:20:52,044
Point of impact right here.

211
00:20:55,048 --> 00:20:57,384
The first engine uncoupled,
and the train jumped the track.

212
00:20:57,467 --> 00:20:58,927
About 100 yards?

213
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,971
You must get new boots.

214
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,431
I told you not to wear the heels.

215
00:21:02,556 --> 00:21:04,058
Wear two coats.

216
00:21:04,225 --> 00:21:05,435
Next train wreck.

217
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,853
Why do we always mother her?

218
00:21:06,978 --> 00:21:08,480
Because she loves us.

219
00:21:08,647 --> 00:21:12,735
- How'd you like to be the driver?
- I bet he did a Casey Jones.

220
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,320
Hold it, sir.

221
00:21:14,403 --> 00:21:16,114
Hi. Who's in charge?

222
00:21:16,197 --> 00:21:18,116
Sheriff Rollins.

223
00:21:18,241 --> 00:21:20,327
Just follow the TV lights.

224
00:21:21,328 --> 00:21:22,455
Sheriff Rogers.

225
00:21:22,538 --> 00:21:23,915
Rollins!

226
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:31,215
Look down there and take Newman.

227
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:33,885
Come on. Time to go to work.

228
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:38,974
The bus rolled over several times before
settling down at the bottom of the hill.

229
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:40,642
I don't know if I passed out or what...

230
00:21:40,768 --> 00:21:44,731
...but when I looked up,
the train was bearing down on us. Fast.

231
00:21:45,857 --> 00:21:48,985
I don't know how. It's still kind of hazy.

232
00:21:49,444 --> 00:21:52,573
Somehow I grabbed him and pushed him
out of the bus.

233
00:21:52,948 --> 00:21:55,910
- You're brave, you could've been killed.
- I know.

234
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:58,663
He's my partner.
He would have done the same for me.

235
00:21:58,789 --> 00:22:02,543
Excuse me, I'm Deputy U.S.
Marshal Samuel Gerard, I'd like to-

236
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,837
I'll be with you in just a minute.

237
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:08,800
One more time, just for the record...

238
00:22:08,925 --> 00:22:10,969
...these three are dead.

239
00:22:11,971 --> 00:22:13,180
And this one?

240
00:22:14,223 --> 00:22:16,518
Everything happened so fast.

241
00:22:17,686 --> 00:22:19,479
I don't think he made it.

242
00:22:21,065 --> 00:22:23,025
You came a long way for nothing.

243
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:25,028
With all due respect, Sheriff Rollins...

244
00:22:25,111 --> 00:22:27,822
...I'd like to recommend
checkpoints on a 15-mile radius...

245
00:22:27,948 --> 00:22:31,702
...at I-57, I-24 and over here on Route 13...

246
00:22:32,411 --> 00:22:34,705
Wait. The prisoners are all dead.

247
00:22:34,956 --> 00:22:39,419
Checkpoints will get a lot of people frantic
and they'll flood my office with calls.

248
00:22:39,544 --> 00:22:41,755
Well, shit, I'd hate to see that happen...

249
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:44,383
...so I'll take over your investigation.

250
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:48,847
On what authority?

251
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:50,224
The governor...

252
00:22:50,349 --> 00:22:51,517
...the U.S. Marshal's Office...

253
00:22:51,642 --> 00:22:53,769
...5th District, Northern lllinois.

254
00:22:55,229 --> 00:22:59,276
All right, you want jurisdiction
over this mess. You got it.

255
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:01,737
Okay, boys, gather around and listen up.

256
00:23:01,946 --> 00:23:04,907
We're shutting it down.
Wyatt Earp is here to mop up...

257
00:23:05,033 --> 00:23:06,951
That's very funny, Wyatt Earp.

258
00:23:07,494 --> 00:23:08,328
Sam.

259
00:23:09,329 --> 00:23:10,622
Look here!

260
00:23:14,335 --> 00:23:18,465
We're always fascinated when
we find leg irons with no legs in them.

261
00:23:18,673 --> 00:23:20,300
Who held the key, sir?

262
00:23:20,425 --> 00:23:21,385
Me.

263
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,137
Where're those keys at?

264
00:23:23,596 --> 00:23:24,430
I don't know.

265
00:23:24,514 --> 00:23:26,641
Care to revise your statement, sir?

266
00:23:26,933 --> 00:23:27,642
What?

267
00:23:27,726 --> 00:23:30,437
Do you want to change
your bullshit story, sir?

268
00:23:34,192 --> 00:23:36,569
- He might've got out.
- He might've got out.

269
00:23:36,694 --> 00:23:38,321
You said he was part of the wreckage!

270
00:23:38,405 --> 00:23:41,659
Set up operations by the fire truck.
Listen, everyone!

271
00:23:42,117 --> 00:23:44,912
A fugitive has been on
the run for 90 minutes.

272
00:23:45,288 --> 00:23:49,293
Average foot speed over uneven ground,
barring injury, is four miles an hour.

273
00:23:49,376 --> 00:23:51,962
That gives us a radius of six miles.

274
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:59,137
What I want out of each and everyone of
you is a hard target search of every...

275
00:24:00,347 --> 00:24:04,018
...residence, warehouse, farmhouse,
hen house, outhouse...

276
00:24:04,185 --> 00:24:06,229
...and doghouse in that area.

277
00:24:06,354 --> 00:24:08,940
Checkpoints go up at 15 miles.

278
00:24:10,108 --> 00:24:13,571
Your fugitive's name is Dr. Richard Kimble.

279
00:24:16,991 --> 00:24:18,285
Go get him.

280
00:25:33,289 --> 00:25:34,499
Please don't give me shit.

281
00:25:34,624 --> 00:25:37,419
I got three very unhappy dead people.
Put him on.

282
00:25:37,752 --> 00:25:39,671
Stevens, it's Cosmo.

283
00:25:39,796 --> 00:25:42,758
I'll have a satellite telephone hookup
in two seconds.

284
00:25:42,842 --> 00:25:45,386
Chester Police just found a blood trail...

285
00:25:45,762 --> 00:25:47,722
...two miles southwest.

286
00:25:48,139 --> 00:25:50,934
Match that blood against the prisoners'.

287
00:25:52,978 --> 00:25:55,857
Get a fax I.D. on Kimble
to every local hospital.

288
00:25:56,065 --> 00:25:58,026
And follow that with troopers.

289
00:26:01,655 --> 00:26:03,074
What are you doing?

290
00:26:03,449 --> 00:26:04,742
I'm thinking.

291
00:26:04,909 --> 00:26:08,413
Think me up some coffee and a
doughnut with sprinkles on top...

292
00:26:08,497 --> 00:26:10,207
...while you're thinking.

293
00:26:10,624 --> 00:26:12,084
We got a live body!

294
00:26:12,209 --> 00:26:13,669
A live one?

295
00:26:19,092 --> 00:26:22,471
Come on. Hang in there, brother.
We'll get you out of here.

296
00:26:26,309 --> 00:26:28,270
Get that ambulance down here! Come on!

297
00:27:34,972 --> 00:27:36,558
Is this what you want?

298
00:27:37,434 --> 00:27:38,602
That's it.

299
00:27:38,727 --> 00:27:40,687
I'm going to make some copies.

300
00:28:04,298 --> 00:28:08,053
Good morning, Mr. Johnson.
I have your breakfast for you.

301
00:28:09,513 --> 00:28:11,640
We're thirsty today, aren't we?

302
00:28:11,849 --> 00:28:14,143
Eat up before this gets cold.

303
00:28:19,107 --> 00:28:22,403
It really does get dry in here, doesn't it?

304
00:28:27,117 --> 00:28:28,577
Here you are.

305
00:28:28,952 --> 00:28:30,746
Now, you eat something, Mr. Johnson.

306
00:28:30,871 --> 00:28:32,581
You need your strength.

307
00:29:18,593 --> 00:29:22,932
Doc, we're looking for a prisoner
from that wreck. He might be hurt.

308
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,726
What does he look like?

309
00:29:24,809 --> 00:29:27,646
Six-one, 180, brown hair,
brown eyes, beard.

310
00:29:27,771 --> 00:29:29,398
Seen anyone like that around?

311
00:29:29,523 --> 00:29:31,734
Every time I look in the mirror, pal.

312
00:29:31,984 --> 00:29:33,736
Except for the beard, of course.

313
00:29:33,819 --> 00:29:34,779
Doc!

314
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:42,538
Thanks.

315
00:29:56,638 --> 00:29:59,099
- I'll give you a hand.
- Thanks, Doc.

316
00:30:00,851 --> 00:30:01,810
It's...

317
00:30:02,937 --> 00:30:04,021
How is he doing?

318
00:30:04,105 --> 00:30:07,108
Good, considering we dug him out
from under a train.

319
00:30:08,235 --> 00:30:11,238
Tell those attending he's got a puncture
in the upper gastric area.

320
00:30:11,363 --> 00:30:13,991
How could he tell that
by looking at his face?

321
00:30:23,002 --> 00:30:25,630
Background just came in from Chicago.

322
00:30:26,089 --> 00:30:28,091
About time. What've we got?

323
00:30:28,592 --> 00:30:32,137
"Richard Davis Kimble, vascular surgeon. "
What the hell is that?

324
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:34,807
Somebody that makes more money
than you.

325
00:30:34,891 --> 00:30:37,769
"Convicted of first-degree murder of his
wife.

326
00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:41,023
"Pleaded innocent. "
Says a one-armed man did it.

327
00:30:41,231 --> 00:30:42,525
Lots of friends.

328
00:30:42,608 --> 00:30:44,902
Doctors, hospital staff.

329
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:48,740
We'll start there. I want phone taps.
First, his lawyer.

330
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:50,325
You'll never going to get that.

331
00:30:50,409 --> 00:30:53,120
Call Judge Rubin.
Tell him I want phone taps.

332
00:30:53,245 --> 00:30:54,872
Why'd you yell at me?

333
00:30:54,956 --> 00:30:57,083
I'll tell him who if I'm in a good mood.

334
00:30:57,208 --> 00:30:59,086
Why not yell at her sometimes?

335
00:30:59,586 --> 00:31:02,047
We got a call from the hospital.

336
00:31:02,214 --> 00:31:04,884
The wounded guard swears
he saw Kimble there.

337
00:31:05,051 --> 00:31:06,010
That's hot.

338
00:31:06,094 --> 00:31:07,888
And an ambulance is missing.

339
00:31:08,054 --> 00:31:10,557
Where the hell is he going
in an ambulance?

340
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:30,956
Ambulance just spotted...

341
00:31:31,081 --> 00:31:35,378
...two miles west of Doverville,
heading north, State Highway 53.

342
00:31:35,461 --> 00:31:36,921
Running out of map!

343
00:31:50,896 --> 00:31:52,398
Get your maps out.

344
00:31:52,565 --> 00:31:55,068
Check, sound check. Get your maps out.

345
00:32:01,241 --> 00:32:04,036
I want to know all routes
in and out of that town.

346
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:19,721
We're headed north on Route 13,
toward the Barkley Dam.

347
00:32:19,888 --> 00:32:21,140
Son of a bitch!

348
00:32:28,231 --> 00:32:30,025
Don't lose that ambulance.

349
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:46,503
Visual location of an ambulance headed
north on Route 13 toward Barkley Dam.

350
00:32:46,711 --> 00:32:48,672
We'll pass through a viaduct.

351
00:32:52,551 --> 00:32:56,306
Get on the horn. Bring Biggs and Newman
in from the south side of the viaduct.

352
00:32:56,389 --> 00:32:57,766
He's hauling ass.

353
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:07,027
Is there a tunnel between here and there?
We have Biggs and Newman?

354
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:11,991
Look on your map
to know how to get there.

355
00:33:39,356 --> 00:33:40,649
We got him!

356
00:33:59,254 --> 00:34:01,298
Watch out! Watch out! Watch out!

357
00:34:04,719 --> 00:34:06,930
- What's going on?
- Get back in your car, sir!

358
00:34:09,725 --> 00:34:12,019
Newman! Rock and roll!

359
00:34:21,572 --> 00:34:23,032
Put a light in there!

360
00:34:24,325 --> 00:34:25,785
Put a light in there!

361
00:34:26,035 --> 00:34:27,579
What do you got?

362
00:34:27,704 --> 00:34:29,206
I got nothing.

363
00:34:30,582 --> 00:34:32,877
- What do you got?
- You gotta be kidding me!

364
00:34:33,002 --> 00:34:34,629
You gotta be kidding me!

365
00:34:40,594 --> 00:34:43,639
Seal off the tunnel! Seal it off!

366
00:35:02,953 --> 00:35:04,455
We got a gopher.

367
00:35:19,348 --> 00:35:22,351
Shit! I just bought these shoes.

368
00:35:22,476 --> 00:35:24,270
Shut up, Cosmo.

369
00:35:24,645 --> 00:35:26,105
Which way, Sam?

370
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,775
I didn't kill my wife!

371
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:18,403
I don't care!

372
00:38:11,006 --> 00:38:12,466
Put that gun down!

373
00:38:14,677 --> 00:38:16,304
Put that gun down!

374
00:38:17,472 --> 00:38:18,598
Now!

375
00:38:19,808 --> 00:38:20,976
Hands up!

376
00:38:21,644 --> 00:38:22,895
Over your head!

377
00:38:23,521 --> 00:38:24,814
Turn around!

378
00:38:26,566 --> 00:38:28,693
Richard, do you want to get shot?

379
00:38:35,034 --> 00:38:36,661
Pay attention!

380
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:38,789
Get down on your knees!

381
00:38:38,914 --> 00:38:40,707
Right now!

382
00:39:05,236 --> 00:39:06,613
What happened? Where'd he go?

383
00:39:06,696 --> 00:39:09,366
He did a Peter Pan right here off this dam!

384
00:39:09,491 --> 00:39:10,868
Right here!

385
00:39:10,951 --> 00:39:12,745
Down! Boom!

386
00:39:12,953 --> 00:39:14,831
Holy shit!

387
00:39:17,292 --> 00:39:18,251
Can we go home now?

388
00:39:18,335 --> 00:39:19,211
No.

389
00:39:21,505 --> 00:39:23,090
Holy shit!

390
00:39:28,847 --> 00:39:31,392
- There's no way out of here!
- We must go up.

391
00:39:34,645 --> 00:39:36,940
Go up the stairs! Up, up!

392
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:46,409
Have that water turned off.
Come over here.

393
00:39:46,659 --> 00:39:49,788
Put two patrol cars on that bridge
down there, four patrolmen.

394
00:39:49,913 --> 00:39:52,666
Have them glass this river
upstream and down.

395
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:57,714
I want a helicopter 100 feet off this river.
Make him aware of these wires.

396
00:39:57,797 --> 00:39:59,925
Are you out of your mind? He's dead!

397
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:01,927
That'll make him easy to catch.

398
00:40:02,052 --> 00:40:05,306
I want hounds on both banks
of this river for two miles...

399
00:40:05,431 --> 00:40:07,726
...upstream and downstream.

400
00:40:08,935 --> 00:40:11,605
You've got a search-and-rescue team?

401
00:40:11,939 --> 00:40:15,109
Get them down here and drag
the bottom of this spillway.

402
00:40:15,276 --> 00:40:19,239
- Why isn't the water turned off?
- Somebody from County's working on it.

403
00:40:57,867 --> 00:41:00,037
Bring in the helicopters now.

404
00:41:00,162 --> 00:41:01,956
We're out of here!

405
00:41:02,081 --> 00:41:04,041
I don't think there's anything to find.

406
00:41:04,167 --> 00:41:07,796
Find it anyway. You've got lights
and generators coming tonight.

407
00:41:33,784 --> 00:41:37,247
- I won't tell you how to do your job...
- Put the helicopter on the bridge!

408
00:41:37,372 --> 00:41:41,710
...but only one person in a million could
survive that fall. The guy is fish food!

409
00:41:41,794 --> 00:41:44,589
Get a cane pole.
Go catch the fish that ate him.

410
00:41:45,798 --> 00:41:48,552
Get Stevens. Tell him we're on the way in.

411
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,088
That man took everything from me!

412
00:43:36,052 --> 00:43:37,596
We can't find the guy.

413
00:43:40,641 --> 00:43:42,184
We can't find the guy.

414
00:43:44,604 --> 00:43:46,731
You find that man!

415
00:43:55,033 --> 00:43:56,576
You find that man!

416
00:43:56,701 --> 00:43:58,161
You find that man!

417
00:44:03,793 --> 00:44:05,795
The generators and searchlights
are there now.

418
00:44:05,879 --> 00:44:08,840
They'll continue the search into the night.

419
00:44:08,924 --> 00:44:11,886
Good. Call Kentucky and
thank them for the dogs.

420
00:44:12,344 --> 00:44:15,473
Remember, opera ain't over
until the Big Dog howls.

421
00:45:18,171 --> 00:45:19,506
Need a ride?

422
00:45:39,196 --> 00:45:40,489
Check it again.

423
00:45:41,031 --> 00:45:44,786
All right, we got him. He shacked up
with some babe over in Whiting.

424
00:45:45,203 --> 00:45:47,664
She left work tonight and took him home.

425
00:45:47,789 --> 00:45:52,461
- About two hours ago, her boss said.
- They spotted her car outside her house.

426
00:45:52,962 --> 00:45:54,672
Does she run with anyone?

427
00:45:54,797 --> 00:45:57,258
No one we could find. No family either.

428
00:45:57,425 --> 00:46:02,306
Tell the police not to move till we get
there. We'll go first thing in the morning.

429
00:46:02,431 --> 00:46:04,141
Your cousin still got his truck?

430
00:46:04,267 --> 00:46:06,227
Call him. Tell him we need it.

431
00:46:26,668 --> 00:46:28,545
Be drunk, Newman.

432
00:46:29,796 --> 00:46:31,090
Stay close.

433
00:46:32,132 --> 00:46:33,843
Right on your ass, buddy.

434
00:46:41,143 --> 00:46:43,938
I don't want you getting lost.
You stick with me.

435
00:46:57,495 --> 00:46:59,498
U.S. marshals! Everybody down!

436
00:47:05,505 --> 00:47:08,300
Hold it right there! Show me those hands!

437
00:47:12,638 --> 00:47:13,806
Keep them up!

438
00:47:18,562 --> 00:47:20,773
Get your ass in there.

439
00:47:21,065 --> 00:47:24,402
I got your man! I got your man,
you hear me?

440
00:47:25,778 --> 00:47:27,739
I want out of here!

441
00:47:27,948 --> 00:47:29,616
I got your man!

442
00:47:30,284 --> 00:47:31,785
I got your man!

443
00:47:32,661 --> 00:47:36,291
I'm going to blow his brains out!
I want out of here!

444
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,086
Do you hear me, Cops?

445
00:47:39,586 --> 00:47:41,213
Do you hear me?

446
00:47:41,338 --> 00:47:42,840
I want out of here!

447
00:47:44,133 --> 00:47:47,095
- Listen! We can work this out!
- Yes, we can.

448
00:47:47,762 --> 00:47:50,474
Shut up! Shut up!

449
00:47:50,974 --> 00:47:52,351
Do you hear me?

450
00:47:53,227 --> 00:47:55,980
Listen, and I'll tell you what I want.

451
00:47:56,064 --> 00:47:57,983
I just want a car out front.

452
00:48:01,862 --> 00:48:03,322
Don't shoot.

453
00:48:03,406 --> 00:48:04,824
It's over.

454
00:48:27,142 --> 00:48:28,185
Shut up!

455
00:49:02,641 --> 00:49:05,269
I can't hear anything. My ear is...

456
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:10,526
I can't believe you did that.

457
00:49:11,819 --> 00:49:14,489
You think I should've
bargained with that guy.

458
00:49:16,282 --> 00:49:17,242
Yeah.

459
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,411
I do.

460
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:21,664
You could have missed.

461
00:49:22,623 --> 00:49:24,500
You could have killed me.

462
00:49:26,961 --> 00:49:28,421
How bad is that ear?

463
00:49:29,131 --> 00:49:31,258
Terrible. I'll have permanent damage.

464
00:49:31,383 --> 00:49:32,635
Let me see it.

465
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:34,345
Come here.

466
00:49:35,388 --> 00:49:37,515
Can you hear what I'm saying now?

467
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:38,725
Yeah.

468
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:42,271
I don't...

469
00:49:43,064 --> 00:49:44,190
...bargain.

470
00:49:45,817 --> 00:49:47,027
You hear that?

471
00:49:48,153 --> 00:49:49,112
Yeah.

472
00:49:50,781 --> 00:49:51,782
Good.

473
00:50:34,665 --> 00:50:36,167
Walter, this is Richard.

474
00:50:36,292 --> 00:50:40,339
Richard, Jesus! Why did you run?
Running only makes you look guilty.

475
00:50:41,131 --> 00:50:43,342
I wasn't worried about appearances,
Walter.

476
00:50:43,467 --> 00:50:46,846
Tell me where you are,
so I can meet you and you can surrender.

477
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:49,641
I won't surrender. I need help, money.

478
00:50:51,185 --> 00:50:55,315
You're asking me to harbor and aid a
convicted felon. I can't help you that way.

479
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,444
My advice both as your friend and
legal counselor is to give yourself up.

480
00:50:59,569 --> 00:51:01,739
Now tell me, where are you?

481
00:51:02,448 --> 00:51:03,783
St. Louis.

482
00:51:04,158 --> 00:51:07,162
Give me an address.
I'll get there as soon as I can.

483
00:51:12,793 --> 00:51:16,548
Mr. Copeland was a bad man.
He was going to kill one of my kids.

484
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:20,886
Well, sir, you can blame me.
I'm the one that shot him.

485
00:51:30,856 --> 00:51:33,401
Give yourself up.
Now tell me, where are you?

486
00:51:34,318 --> 00:51:35,069
St. Louis.

487
00:51:35,194 --> 00:51:38,198
So he's not dead.
Let that be a lesson to you.

488
00:51:38,281 --> 00:51:41,827
Don't ever argue with the Big Dog.
Big Dog is always right.

489
00:51:42,661 --> 00:51:44,455
Yeah, you been right before.

490
00:51:46,916 --> 00:51:48,543
Walter, this is Richard.

491
00:51:50,337 --> 00:51:53,132
Why did you run?
It only makes you look guilty.

492
00:51:53,257 --> 00:51:55,635
I wasn't worried about appearances.

493
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:59,222
Tell me where you are,
so I can meet you and you can surrender.

494
00:51:59,348 --> 00:52:01,600
I won't surrender. I need help, money.

495
00:52:01,725 --> 00:52:04,645
I might be crazy,
but that train sounds like an El.

496
00:52:04,771 --> 00:52:06,481
St. Louis doesn't have one.

497
00:52:06,606 --> 00:52:08,191
How do you know it's an elevated train?

498
00:52:08,275 --> 00:52:11,111
I lived under an El for 20 years.

499
00:52:11,236 --> 00:52:15,909
Explain the difference between the sound
of an El and a train on the ground.

500
00:52:15,992 --> 00:52:17,327
You must have ears like an eagle.

501
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:20,581
Play that back.
I want to hear the sound of an El.

502
00:52:20,706 --> 00:52:23,668
What cities have Els?
New York has got an El.

503
00:52:23,751 --> 00:52:25,086
- Philly.
- We do.

504
00:52:25,169 --> 00:52:26,671
Milwaukee has got an El.

505
00:52:26,755 --> 00:52:29,716
Hold it! Where the lawyer says he's guilty.
There's a bell in the background.

506
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:33,930
There's a guy on a P.A.
Can you drop everything but him?

507
00:52:34,055 --> 00:52:35,431
I'll try. Hold on.

508
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:40,896
Right there.

509
00:52:41,897 --> 00:52:43,065
What's he saying?

510
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:46,861
Sounds like, "Next stop. " Do that again!

511
00:52:50,199 --> 00:52:51,659
"Next stop... "

512
00:52:52,409 --> 00:52:53,869
"Merchandise Mart. "

513
00:52:54,203 --> 00:52:56,372
Son of a bitch! Our boy came home.

514
00:52:56,581 --> 00:52:59,835
That bell is on the Wells Street bridge,
six blocks away.

515
00:53:01,211 --> 00:53:02,671
I knew it was an El.

516
00:53:02,755 --> 00:53:04,966
Yeah, Big Dog. You're never wrong.

517
00:53:05,341 --> 00:53:08,303
- I'll call the C.P.D.
- This is his Chicago file.

518
00:53:08,595 --> 00:53:09,596
Andiamo, bambini.

519
00:53:09,721 --> 00:53:12,683
Sammy, when I die,
I want to come back just like you.

520
00:53:12,767 --> 00:53:14,227
Happy and handsome?

521
00:53:15,103 --> 00:53:16,521
- I'll notify the press.
- No press.

522
00:53:16,604 --> 00:53:17,939
Right, no press.

523
00:53:37,212 --> 00:53:38,797
- Hi, Billy.
- How's it going, sir?

524
00:53:38,922 --> 00:53:40,883
- Good, and you?
- All right.

525
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:47,349
- Here you go, Billy.
- Have a good one, sir.

526
00:54:00,906 --> 00:54:03,367
Spare change? Dollar, mister?

527
00:54:03,868 --> 00:54:06,371
No, thank you very much. I don't want it.

528
00:54:09,416 --> 00:54:11,543
Oh, my God. Richard!

529
00:54:12,419 --> 00:54:13,337
How are you, Charlie?

530
00:54:13,421 --> 00:54:14,881
Jesus, you're back.

531
00:54:15,381 --> 00:54:16,800
I need some money.

532
00:54:16,925 --> 00:54:18,260
Sure, sure. Get in.

533
00:54:18,385 --> 00:54:20,929
No, I can't. Just whatever you got on you.

534
00:54:21,055 --> 00:54:23,349
You're hot, pal. If not now, you will be.

535
00:54:23,432 --> 00:54:26,603
Have you got a place to stay?
I mean, how can I help you?

536
00:54:28,188 --> 00:54:30,315
You've got a green light. Move on!

537
00:54:31,191 --> 00:54:32,401
I'll call you.

538
00:54:42,830 --> 00:54:45,249
So why did Richard Kimble kill his wife?

539
00:54:45,375 --> 00:54:46,793
He did it for the money.

540
00:54:46,876 --> 00:54:49,671
For the money? He's a doctor.
He's already rich.

541
00:54:49,755 --> 00:54:51,173
She was more rich.

542
00:54:52,216 --> 00:54:55,053
Is this the entire Chicago Police
Department file?

543
00:54:55,178 --> 00:54:58,431
- That's everything.
- I want to do all the interviews again.

544
00:54:58,723 --> 00:55:01,435
The list of hospital staff is it in the file?

545
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:02,228
Sure is.

546
00:55:02,353 --> 00:55:03,270
Thank you.

547
00:55:03,396 --> 00:55:05,356
You don't want to use the media?

548
00:55:05,607 --> 00:55:09,653
We want him to relax. Make himself
comfortable. Try to re-enter his life.

549
00:55:13,866 --> 00:55:16,119
Here's the apartment.

550
00:55:16,369 --> 00:55:19,498
You can see here is heater.
You will have warm.

551
00:55:19,706 --> 00:55:21,959
Here is kitchen. Sink.

552
00:55:22,042 --> 00:55:24,879
Over there is bathroom.
And here is the room.

553
00:55:25,254 --> 00:55:26,714
Is nice bed.

554
00:55:26,798 --> 00:55:28,216
Plenty space.

555
00:55:28,508 --> 00:55:29,843
You can look at.

556
00:55:53,412 --> 00:55:55,164
So you like the place?

557
00:55:55,581 --> 00:55:57,042
It's okay with you?

558
00:55:57,751 --> 00:55:58,919
It's perfect.

559
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:01,130
All right, people.

560
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:05,176
As this morning we were notified
by the U.S. Marshal's Office...

561
00:56:05,259 --> 00:56:09,890
...that our old friend Dr. Richard Kimble
is alive and well and back here in Chicago.

562
00:56:11,392 --> 00:56:14,353
You all know in what high regard
we hold this scumbag.

563
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:17,774
So I'm personally donating a
bottle of 12-year-old Scotch...

564
00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:20,360
...to whoever puts the collar on this quack.

565
00:56:20,486 --> 00:56:22,905
Dick Rosetti is passing out bulletins.

566
00:57:44,667 --> 00:57:46,211
- Help you?
- Gracias.

567
00:59:18,985 --> 00:59:20,654
You went to medical school together?

568
00:59:20,779 --> 00:59:22,156
Yes, we did.

569
00:59:22,990 --> 00:59:24,742
The class of '73.

570
00:59:26,161 --> 00:59:27,495
You know Morton Feinberg?

571
00:59:27,621 --> 00:59:29,498
- I do.
- He's a real nice guy.

572
00:59:30,499 --> 00:59:31,625
When did you see him last?

573
00:59:31,709 --> 00:59:33,002
Who, Richard?

574
00:59:35,546 --> 00:59:37,966
I saw Richard this morning.

575
00:59:38,467 --> 00:59:39,426
You saw him this morning?

576
00:59:39,551 --> 00:59:41,971
He stopped me in my car.
I gave him money.

577
00:59:44,056 --> 00:59:45,308
Where was this?

578
00:59:45,934 --> 00:59:47,894
Outside my tennis club.

579
00:59:48,019 --> 00:59:49,146
Did he ask for help?

580
00:59:49,271 --> 00:59:52,274
I volunteered. He wouldn't accept that.

581
00:59:52,566 --> 00:59:54,277
How much did you give him?

582
00:59:54,986 --> 00:59:56,696
Couple of bucks. Just what I had on me.

583
00:59:56,821 --> 01:00:00,117
- He won't get far on that.
- Why'd he come back to Chicago?

584
01:00:00,492 --> 01:00:01,660
He didn't tell me that, sir.

585
01:00:01,785 --> 01:00:06,040
I'm sure he's trying to protect you
from having to lie for him, but...

586
01:00:10,128 --> 01:00:12,548
You really want to be
his friend and help him?

587
01:00:12,631 --> 01:00:14,759
Help us bring him in unharmed.

588
01:00:15,802 --> 01:00:16,886
Why?

589
01:00:17,596 --> 01:00:19,556
So he can go back to prison?

590
01:00:22,434 --> 01:00:25,730
If you want help, gentlemen,
you've come to the wrong man.

591
01:00:26,105 --> 01:00:28,233
Richard is innocent.

592
01:00:28,567 --> 01:00:31,195
You'll never find him. He's too smart.

593
01:00:32,112 --> 01:00:33,572
We're some smart guys.

594
01:00:33,698 --> 01:00:38,245
What about us? We're smart. We are.
How smart could he be, really?

595
01:00:39,329 --> 01:00:41,123
Is he as smart as you are?

596
01:00:42,458 --> 01:00:43,834
Smarter.

597
01:01:02,565 --> 01:01:06,444
Peripheral vascular surgery. Fixing
the arteries as they come out of the heart.

598
01:01:06,528 --> 01:01:10,282
- How long have you known Kimble?
- Ten years. Since I've been here.

599
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:17,374
What kind of medicine did he practice
here at the hospital?

600
01:01:38,190 --> 01:01:41,318
I want you to know that
I believe Kimble to be innocent.

601
01:01:41,902 --> 01:01:43,487
Would he come to you for help?

602
01:01:43,613 --> 01:01:45,573
If he came to me, I would help.

603
01:01:46,324 --> 01:01:47,659
But he wouldn't come to me.

604
01:01:47,784 --> 01:01:49,244
That's not his style.

605
01:02:06,514 --> 01:02:10,811
A warrant remains outstanding for
Chicago surgeon, Richard Kimble.

606
01:02:25,453 --> 01:02:29,833
This is where the one-armed guy
he struggled fell down the stairs.

607
01:02:33,629 --> 01:02:37,008
If I fell down these stairs,
I'd be a goner. I'd be dead.

608
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:48,980
What a waste!

609
01:02:57,866 --> 01:03:00,452
When I came home,
there was a man in my house.

610
01:03:26,483 --> 01:03:27,442
Richard.

611
01:04:21,004 --> 01:04:23,424
You like stringing out
12-year-old girls, huh?

612
01:04:23,507 --> 01:04:25,134
What are you doing with my baby?

613
01:04:25,259 --> 01:04:27,262
Your baby's a drug dealer, lady.

614
01:04:27,721 --> 01:04:29,139
Come on, ma'am.

615
01:04:29,556 --> 01:04:32,059
What they doing to my baby?

616
01:04:59,091 --> 01:05:02,011
It will be crazy here tonight.
Did they get a count?

617
01:05:02,094 --> 01:05:03,721
A lot of kids.

618
01:05:05,431 --> 01:05:06,724
They bring them all here?

619
01:05:06,808 --> 01:05:08,268
All coming down here to County.

620
01:05:33,047 --> 01:05:35,007
I've come to do those blinds.

621
01:05:35,258 --> 01:05:36,676
I'll get the door.

622
01:05:47,272 --> 01:05:49,232
I'll start in here, huh?
