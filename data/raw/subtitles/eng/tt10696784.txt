01:14:19,791 --> 01:14:22,708
He ain't said a word to me
when he came home.

1046
01:14:24,333 --> 01:14:25,458
The next day,

1047
01:14:26,583 --> 01:14:28,791
he sent me to live with my grandparents.

1048
01:14:30,375 --> 01:14:32,875
And then the next time I seen my sister,

1049
01:14:34,291 --> 01:14:36,208
she was laying in a coffin.

1050
01:14:38,375 --> 01:14:39,875
Disease had killed her.

1051
01:14:47,125 --> 01:14:49,458
I'm sorry your sister had to suffer.

1052
01:14:53,833 --> 01:14:55,666
I admire her bravery.

1053
01:14:59,375 --> 01:15:01,625
But you get no words from me.

1054
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:05,541
You know,

1055
01:15:06,458 --> 01:15:08,958
I actually admire <i>your</i> bravery.

1056
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:15,666
But I'm afraid the outcome
is still the outcome.

1057
01:15:16,583 --> 01:15:17,625
Hope

1058
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:19,875
must die.

1059
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:28,041
[Mary continues struggling]

1060
01:15:34,208 --> 01:15:35,166
But not yet.

1061
01:15:35,250 --> 01:15:36,750
[gasping]

1062
01:15:37,875 --> 01:15:40,750
[coughing]

1063
01:15:44,541 --> 01:15:45,625
[breathing heavily]

1064
01:15:48,333 --> 01:15:49,333
[Mary grunts]

1065
01:15:49,416 --> 01:15:52,541
Leave her out here in the street
so everybody can see her.

1066
01:15:52,625 --> 01:15:55,833
No one come to collect her 'fore sunup,
put a bullet in her head.

1067
01:15:55,916 --> 01:15:56,916
[man] Yes, ma'am.

1068
01:15:58,666 --> 01:16:00,458
Looks like we don't
have to wait that long.

1069
01:16:01,416 --> 01:16:03,416
[dub music playing]

1070
01:16:35,083 --> 01:16:36,541
Whoever die first, right?

1071
01:16:37,166 --> 01:16:39,125
-Whoever die first.
-[Jim] Mmm-hmm.

1072
01:16:43,083 --> 01:16:43,916
Get her up.

1073
01:16:45,875 --> 01:16:47,500
"Whoever die first"?

1074
01:16:49,208 --> 01:16:51,291
Now, what kind of dumbass saying is that?

1075
01:16:52,125 --> 01:16:53,666
You two trying to get shot out here?

1076
01:16:55,166 --> 01:16:58,166
Nat Love. How predictable.

1077
01:16:59,083 --> 01:17:02,708
You predict my friend Bill Pickett
aiming at your bowler cap?

1078
01:17:05,125 --> 01:17:07,333
You'll be dead
before your boys get their aim.

1079
01:17:07,416 --> 01:17:09,000
And you die right after.

1080
01:17:10,791 --> 01:17:13,375
But your boss won't see
one red cent of that money.

1081
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,208
My boss?

1082
01:17:16,291 --> 01:17:17,250
Where is he?

1083
01:17:18,708 --> 01:17:20,000
Where is who?

1084
01:17:20,541 --> 01:17:21,375
[Nat] Marshal.

1085
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,375
I'm speakin' English, yeah?

1086
01:17:24,458 --> 01:17:26,541
-Sound like English to me.
-[Nat] Mmm-hmm.

1087
01:17:26,625 --> 01:17:28,208
Where's Rufus Buck?

1088
01:17:28,875 --> 01:17:29,875
[Trudy] Oh.

1089
01:17:30,625 --> 01:17:31,583
Ooh-hoo.

1090

Bass.

1091
01:17:36,291 --> 01:17:37,333
[Bass] Trudy.

1092
01:17:37,416 --> 01:17:40,958
If I'd known you were switchin' sides,
I'da asked you to come join us.

1093
01:17:45,375 --> 01:17:47,500
You here for your damsel in distress?

1094
01:18:00,666 --> 01:18:02,958
You don't look hard of hearing.

1095
01:18:04,583 --> 01:18:05,583
So I'ma ask you again.

1096
01:18:07,291 --> 01:18:08,666
Where's Rufus Buck?

1097
01:18:09,541 --> 01:18:12,333
Well, clearly, you don't know me.

1098
01:18:14,791 --> 01:18:16,125
Tell your men to go,

1099
01:18:17,125 --> 01:18:18,625
but you stay,

1100
01:18:19,791 --> 01:18:22,541
and maybe your damsel
will live a little longer.

1101
01:18:31,791 --> 01:18:32,708
Marshal.

1102
01:18:36,625 --> 01:18:37,500
[Trudy] Oh.

1103
01:18:38,208 --> 01:18:39,458
You're pretty though.

1104
01:18:40,583 --> 01:18:42,125
[laughs]

1105
01:18:43,166 --> 01:18:45,500
-Ah, take her ass back in there.
-Yes, ma'am.

1106
01:18:45,583 --> 01:18:47,083
Gonna get me a drink.

1107
01:18:47,166 --> 01:18:48,000
[Jim] Hey.

1108
01:18:48,875 --> 01:18:50,875
That the quick draw
I hear tell about, Cherokee Bill?

1109
01:18:52,041 --> 01:18:55,041
I hear you so fast
that your opponents ain't got time to draw

1110
01:18:55,875 --> 01:18:57,666
before you put two in they back.

1111
01:18:59,250 --> 01:19:00,583
No, that ain't me.

1112
01:19:01,625 --> 01:19:05,083
I'm the Cherokee Bill that shoots men
in the mouth that talk too much.

1113
01:19:05,958 --> 01:19:06,791
[Jim scoffs]

1114
01:19:06,875 --> 01:19:08,500
I'll make it easy for you, then.

1115
01:19:09,666 --> 01:19:10,791
You draw first.

1116
01:19:11,416 --> 01:19:12,583
[tense string music playing]

1117
01:19:12,666 --> 01:19:15,750
That what you think this is?
"Who the quickest draw in the West?"

1118
01:19:15,833 --> 01:19:17,750
All comes down
to who fast and who ain't, right?

1119
01:19:17,833 --> 01:19:21,333
No, it all comes down
to who's alive and who's dead.

1120
01:19:21,958 --> 01:19:23,666
[tense string music building]

1121
01:19:24,375 --> 01:19:26,208

something to drink.

-I practiced that standoff all night.
-Jim.

1126
01:19:33,833 --> 01:19:36,208
-[Jim] You're not about to walk away.
-[Nat] Get out of here.

1127
01:19:36,291 --> 01:19:37,916
-No, nobody--
-[Nat] Get out of here, Jim.

-[Jim] That chicken--
-[Bass] It ain't the time.

1129
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:41,541
Okay. Okay.

[suspenseful orchestral music playing]

1131
01:19:47,208 --> 01:19:48,083
[man] March, boy.

1132
01:19:48,625 --> 01:19:50,833
-I said march!
-March.

1133
01:19:52,666 --> 01:19:56,750
Hup, two, three, four.

01:20:15,416 --> 01:20:16,416
That's enough.

[Rufus] You familiar with Napoleon?

1151
01:21:56,583 --> 01:22:00,166
He said, "I am driven towards an end
that I do not know."

1152

"As I reach it,

1153

as I shall become unnecessary,

1154
01:22:06,708 --> 01:22:09,625
an atom shall suffice to shatter me."

1155
01:22:11,125 --> 01:22:15,708
"Until then, all forces of humankind
can do nothing to stop me."

1156
01:22:18,166 --> 01:22:20,333
That's a man who knew exactly who he was.

1157
01:22:21,708 --> 01:22:23,083
Most importantly,

1158
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:26,750
he knew that
his time would come to an end.

1159
01:22:30,708 --> 01:22:31,541
Cut him down.

You know why…

1163
01:22:44,208 --> 01:22:45,791
I gave you that scar?

1164
01:22:47,958 --> 01:22:49,291
[Nat] So I'd remember you.

1165
01:22:53,333 --> 01:22:54,250
[Rufus] No.

1166
01:22:55,541 --> 01:22:59,833
No, I gave you that scar so I can know
your face when you come back to me.

1167
01:23:01,791 --> 01:23:03,000
Nat Love,

1168
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:06,500
the outlaw who robs outlaws,

1169
01:23:07,875 --> 01:23:14,500
the angel of death who hunts down those
who trespass against him with no mercy.

1170
01:23:14,583 --> 01:23:16,041
I know who you are.

1171
01:23:17,708 --> 01:23:20,000
And I see the line that you won't cross.

1172
01:23:20,083 --> 01:23:22,250
[somber song playing]

1173
01:23:22,333 --> 01:23:24,375
See, I know what's on the other side.

1174
01:23:29,875 --> 01:23:31,166
Apologize for the beating.

1175
01:23:31,833 --> 01:23:33,416
[chuckles]

1176
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:35,958
It was more of an indication
for what Ms. Fields might see

1177
01:23:36,041 --> 01:23:38,333
if we fail to come to terms.

1178
01:23:40,958 --> 01:23:42,291
[Nat] What terms?

1179
01:23:43,458 --> 01:23:47,250
You will return the money
you stole from me by Friday noon.

1180
01:23:47,333 --> 01:23:48,625
Not a moment later.

1181
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:53,083
And you will add $10,000 on top of that.
We'll call that interest.

1182
01:23:55,250 --> 01:23:56,166
Somethin' funny?

1183
01:23:56,250 --> 01:23:59,291
Ooh, shit, how…
how you reckon I'ma get that?

1184
01:23:59,875 --> 01:24:01,125
You're gonna rob a bank.

1185
01:24:03,791 --> 01:24:06,125
Nat Love is gonna rob a bank.

1186
01:24:08,375 --> 01:24:12,083
In the meantime, here's a little token
of my appreciation in advance.

1187
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:16,083
Go ahead, open it.

1188
01:24:46,125 --> 01:24:48,125
I expect my money on Friday.

1189
01:24:49,291 --> 01:24:50,166
All of it.

1190
01:25:06,708 --> 01:25:08,416
[Bass] You know I can't let you do that.

1191
01:25:11,541 --> 01:25:14,666
If that money ain't in Rufus' hands
in three days, Mary'll die.

1192
01:25:16,041 --> 01:25:17,791
[Pickett] What bank
we talking about anyway?

1193
01:25:17,875 --> 01:25:18,708
[Nat] Maysville.

1194
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:21,875
Maysville?

1195
01:25:23,083 --> 01:25:24,000
That's a white town.

1196
01:25:24,083 --> 01:25:26,416
Yeah, which is why
they gonna have $10,000 in their bank.

1197
01:25:28,041 --> 01:25:29,041
It's crazy.

1198
01:25:29,125 --> 01:25:31,041
[Jim] My emotions
are all types of confused.

1199
01:25:31,125 --> 01:25:33,291
I mean, Pickett, I agree. That's crazy.

1200
01:25:33,958 --> 01:25:35,916
But, Nat, I also agree with you
telling the marshal

1201
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,791
that we gonna do that shit anyways.

1202
01:25:38,333 --> 01:25:39,916
That's some true outlaw shit.

1203
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,083
-We outlaws, ain't we?
-[Nat] Ain't no "we," Jim.

1204
01:25:43,041 --> 01:25:45,666
Not after that shit you pulled in town
nearly got us all killed.

1205
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:46,583
I had that.

1206
01:25:46,666 --> 01:25:48,750
[Nat] Fetch that money
you took from the Crimson Hoods.

1207
01:25:48,833 --> 01:25:50,250
Pickett, kid, you comin' with me.

1208
01:25:51,250 --> 01:25:53,875
If Rufus Buck want that bank took,
why don't he send his own men?

1209
01:25:53,958 --> 01:25:55,625
This way he clean, see?

1210
01:25:56,375 --> 01:25:58,291
I gotta go in barefaced as day,

1211
01:25:58,833 --> 01:26:02,791
a freshly minted bank robber, face up
on wanted posters all over the territory.

1212
01:26:02,875 --> 01:26:05,458
They'll be on you like flies on shit
before you open the door.

1213
01:26:05,541 --> 01:26:06,625
Yep.

1214
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:09,833
I said <i>I</i> had to be recognized.

1215
01:26:12,958 --> 01:26:14,041
Go ahead.

1216
01:26:27,208 --> 01:26:28,708
[Jim stifling laughter]

1217
01:26:30,666 --> 01:26:31,958
