3
00:01:22,016 --> 00:01:24,669
I... don't know.

4
00:01:24,769 --> 00:01:27,964
Do you want me to spend the night

We can talk more calmly. Do you...

Do you need more time?

8
00:01:36,948 --> 00:01:39,726

Well, I can...

12
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:50,862
I can pick him up after school
and take him...

No.

22

I haven't been much help but
I've finished that job now - it's over.

26
00:02:51,773 --> 00:02:53,883
Maybe I was asking for too much.

27
00:02:53,983 --> 00:02:57,053

No.

change.

41
00:03:33,773 --> 00:03:37,026

anything at all.

- 8.30.

- Where?
- In the park.

49
00:04:04,387 --> 00:04:06,831
- Was he willing?
- Yes, verbally.

50
00:04:06,931 --> 00:04:09,542
Did you sense or detect weariness in him?

51
00:04:09,642 --> 00:04:12,837
No. A correct appraisal of the realities.

52
00:04:12,937 --> 00:04:15,965
- Is it making him bitter?
- No. Greedy.

53
00:04:16,065 --> 00:04:17,884
But you felt his power?

54
00:04:17,984 --> 00:04:19,927
You mean did I feel fear?

55
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:24,015
No because that would have prevented me
answering all your questions.

56
00:04:24,115 --> 00:04:26,768
- How many vials did he take with him?
- Two

57

What procedure have you devised for
contacting him again?

58
00:04:30,246 --> 00:04:31,606
It's all in my report.

59
00:04:31,706 --> 00:04:35,485
I suggest it's more economical
to fill in my successor.

60

We don't feel there is a need
for a successor.

61

for your refusal?

Family.

66
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:50,875
- Couldn't we be of some help there?
- No.

67
00:04:50,975 --> 00:04:53,795
Wouldn't it be advisable for you
to reconsider?

68
00:04:53,895 --> 00:04:55,254
I'm unable to do that.

69
00:04:55,354 --> 00:04:57,256
Would you be unable for a long time?

00:04:57,356 --> 00:04:58,299
I hope not.

you from answering your own questions?

she had to have the cast put on.

182
00:15:43,835 --> 00:15:46,463
You've been alone for a long time?

183
00:15:49,925 --> 00:15:52,010
Look, I got a new boat.

184
00:15:57,558 --> 00:15:59,793
Did you get it from Mummy?

185
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:02,938
No. From Uncle Heinrich.

186
00:16:04,606 --> 00:16:06,316
Long ago?

187
00:16:07,484 --> 00:16:08,760
Yes.

188
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,220
Yesterday?

189
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,615
No. Before you were coming back
from far away.

190
00:16:16,952 --> 00:16:18,896
OK, little piggy.

191
00:16:18,996 --> 00:16:21,482
Come on, let's get out of this mess.

192
00:16:21,582 --> 00:16:23,875
How did you make such a mess?

193
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,476
(KEY IN LOCK)

194
00:17:01,371 --> 00:17:05,400
This is not always like this, Mark.
Usually I'm on time.

195
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,777
I'm not interested.

196
00:17:06,877 --> 00:17:09,988
I came to tell you that
I can't live without you

197
00:17:10,088 --> 00:17:12,366
and I'm ready to understand
whatever there is

198
00:17:12,466 --> 00:17:14,701
but it doesn't look like
it makes much sense.

199
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:17,829
- You can't take Bob away from me.
- I'm not trying.

200
00:17:17,929 --> 00:17:22,976
You can continue to visit whenever
you want, but I'm taking over here.

201
00:17:25,854 --> 00:17:29,107
Anna, is there anything I can do?

202
00:17:30,233 --> 00:17:32,469
- You could just...
- Yes?

203
00:17:32,569 --> 00:17:34,763
- I must...
- Yes?

204
00:17:34,863 --> 00:17:36,014
I must...

205
00:17:36,114 --> 00:17:39,268
You must restore order.
You must leave him.

206
00:17:39,368 --> 00:17:41,853
You will call him.
You will say it is over.

207
00:17:41,953 --> 00:17:44,565
Now, I don't care if you tell him
you love him

208
00:17:44,665 --> 00:17:47,484
but he's not your family -
your family is here.

209
00:17:47,584 --> 00:17:49,695
You must call him now.

210
00:17:49,795 --> 00:17:52,447
- But I can't on the phone.
- I don't trust you.

211
00:17:52,547 --> 00:17:55,826
- I have to tell him face to face.
- I don't trust you.

212
00:17:55,926 --> 00:17:58,370
On the phone.

213
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,914
Oh Jesus!

214
00:18:01,014 --> 00:18:04,543
Jesus! Jesus! Jesus!

215

Jesus!

217
00:18:09,106 --> 00:18:12,734
If you want to stay, make that call.

218
00:18:26,331 --> 00:18:32,045
It's still quite warm. I don't think
you'll need a winter coat or sweater.

219
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:44,975
I can't stand to see you like this.

220
00:18:46,643 --> 00:18:50,397
It could be the way you want.
Just don't cry any more.

I'm staying with you.

Hello, I'm Bob's father. I'll be bringing
him to school from now on.

I'm glad. You're the father who went
far away and met the polar bears.

Hello.

251
00:22:20,231 --> 00:22:21,842

- I mean your wig.
- What?

I'm so sorry. It's impossible.

255
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:30,725
Have you ever seen my wife?

256
00:22:30,825 --> 00:22:33,787
Naturally. Every day of the school year.

257
00:22:47,217 --> 00:22:48,535
You're Heinrich?

258
00:22:48,635 --> 00:22:50,011
Yes.

259
00:22:53,306 --> 00:22:55,141
I've come for Anna.

260
00:22:58,853 --> 00:22:59,921
Anna's not here.

261
00:23:00,021 --> 00:23:02,591
You want me to break down
the bloody door?

262
00:23:02,691 --> 00:23:04,818
You don't have to. It's open.

263
00:23:07,654 --> 00:23:11,933
We don't have to be brutal to each other
or even impolite.

264
00:23:12,033 --> 00:23:16,563
Our situation is like a mountain lake
we are trying to swim in,

265
00:23:16,663 --> 00:23:18,773
starting from different shores.

266
00:23:18,873 --> 00:23:21,151
I am not astonished you are here.

267
00:23:21,251 --> 00:23:24,237
I was thinking about you
just before you came

268
00:23:24,337 --> 00:23:28,174
so now that you're here,
let's be open to each other.

269
00:23:30,635 --> 00:23:33,163
You can hate me as much as you like.

270
00:23:33,263 --> 00:23:36,416
But it's you who wants
to know things from me.

271
00:23:36,516 --> 00:23:38,935
So please make it possible.

272
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:42,964
I am suffering as much as you are.

273
00:23:43,064 --> 00:23:46,968
The fact that Anna did not inform you
was harmful to everyone

274
00:23:47,068 --> 00:23:49,095
but I always accept Anna's ways,

275
00:23:49,195 --> 00:23:52,907
as I think no-one has a right
to impose his will on anyone.

276
00:23:54,284 --> 00:23:56,603
So that's how you've changed her so much.

277
00:23:56,703 --> 00:24:00,065
Possibly, but is it changing her
or making her open to herself?

278
00:24:00,165 --> 00:24:03,652
So open she's inarticulate at night
and you have to speak for her?

279
00:24:03,752 --> 00:24:05,070
What are you talking about?

280
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,781
We spoke on the phone last night,
you and I, didn't we?

281
00:24:07,881 --> 00:24:11,117
Stop it. I just arrived from Hamburg.
You weren't listening to me.

282
00:24:11,217 --> 00:24:14,412
I was just trying to make her comprehend
that I love her.

283
00:24:14,512 --> 00:24:17,874
I left the day you arrived to give her
the chance to decide for herself.

284
00:24:17,974 --> 00:24:19,292
I allowed you your chance.

285
00:24:19,392 --> 00:24:20,627
Bullshit!

286
00:24:20,727 --> 00:24:23,505
I'm not obliged to listen to you speak
in that way. It's offensive.

287
00:24:23,605 --> 00:24:25,715
How long have you been fucking me over?

288
00:24:25,815 --> 00:24:27,192
A year.

289
00:24:31,321 --> 00:24:33,014
All my visits home, all that time.

290
00:24:33,114 --> 00:24:34,140
Yes.

291
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,352
And this is what you mean by
accepting Anna's ways?

292
00:24:37,452 --> 00:24:38,912
Precisely.

293
00:24:43,291 --> 00:24:45,902
The key being the infinitive.

294
00:24:46,002 --> 00:24:47,962
To accept.

295
00:24:55,553 --> 00:24:57,288
I have been honest with you.

296
00:24:57,388 --> 00:25:00,683
Would you permit me to enquire
on a specific point?

297
00:25:02,227 --> 00:25:06,047
On your last visit home,
were you content with your wife?

298
00:25:06,147 --> 00:25:07,882
I mean sexually.

299
00:25:07,982 --> 00:25:09,384
Why?

300
00:25:09,484 --> 00:25:14,305
Because in that period we reached
a state of perfect harmony.

301
00:25:14,405 --> 00:25:16,366
Er...

302
00:25:21,913 --> 00:25:23,623

303
00:25:28,044 --> 00:25:30,196

- Yes.

00:25:30,296 --> 00:25:33,133
- Even when you're fucking Anna?
- Of course.

305
00:25:39,973 --> 00:25:41,307
Agh!

00:26:02,662 --> 00:26:04,080
Why?

307
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:08,334
Why?

308
00:26:17,552 --> 00:26:19,429

One for... the master, one for the dame

318
00:27:00,887 --> 00:27:04,415
and one for the little boy
that lives down the lane.

319
00:27:04,515 --> 00:27:07,919
- Can I go out into the back yard?
- Yes, you may.

320
00:27:08,019 --> 00:27:09,854
But you take your sandwich with you.

321
00:27:16,027 --> 00:27:17,220
Where were you?

322
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,556
I wrote you. I was at Margie's.

323
00:27:19,656 --> 00:27:21,641
That's not true. I spoke to her.

324
00:27:21,741 --> 00:27:22,767
I was with him.

325
00:27:22,867 --> 00:27:26,229
That's not true either. I saw him.
I may... stink from him.

326
00:27:26,329 --> 00:27:27,689
- But he's not lying.
- I was...

327
00:27:27,789 --> 00:27:29,482
- I was with friends.
- Who?

328
00:27:29,582 --> 00:27:31,151
- New friends.
- I'll check.

329
00:27:31,251 --> 00:27:33,778
Yes, check, check, check, check, check!

330
00:27:33,878 --> 00:27:35,530
Why did you leave last night?

331
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:36,614
To be alone!

332
00:27:36,714 --> 00:27:38,825
But you said you went to friends.

333
00:27:38,925 --> 00:27:41,911
Why are you nagging me?
Can't you just leave me in peace?

334
00:27:42,011 --> 00:27:44,914
I could have perfect peace
if you never came back.

335
00:27:45,014 --> 00:27:49,002
It's Bob! I have Bob! He is my son too.

336
00:27:49,102 --> 00:27:51,337
Don't try to tell me you care about him
all that much.

337
00:27:51,437 --> 00:27:53,006
He didn't stop you from breaking us up.

338
00:27:53,106 --> 00:27:56,426
If you really thought about him, you'd
give a thought to us, for Christ's sake.

339
00:27:56,526 --> 00:27:58,094
I do! I do!

340
00:27:58,194 --> 00:28:00,763
No you don't. You think about buying him
a pair of shoes,

341
00:28:00,863 --> 00:28:03,808
about making him a snack,
about telling him a bedtime story

342
00:28:03,908 --> 00:28:06,603
but if you really thought about him,
you'd think about us.

343
00:28:06,703 --> 00:28:11,649
Right, right. Why are you always right?
But it's difficult, don't you understand?

344
00:28:11,749 --> 00:28:16,529
It's difficult. I didn't want it to happen
but it happened and now...

just switch from channel to channel.

fucking your arse off.

00:49:09,714 --> 00:49:11,992
No. She went out.

534
00:49:12,092 --> 00:49:14,161
BOB: Nee-Na, nee-Na, nee-Na.

535
00:49:14,261 --> 00:49:16,538
That's not entirely true. She...

536
00:49:16,638 --> 00:49:18,874
She doesn't live with us any longer.

537
00:49:18,974 --> 00:49:20,000
Oh.

538
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:21,376
It's about Bob.

539
00:49:21,476 --> 00:49:23,295
Ah! Bob!

540
00:49:23,395 --> 00:49:25,105
Bob is fine.

541
00:49:26,731 --> 00:49:30,235
He's just beaten the world record
in tub diving.

542
00:49:33,446 --> 00:49:36,283
Oh! (SHE LAUGHS)

543
00:49:37,367 --> 00:49:39,603
- Hello, Bob.
- Come on. Cut it out, Bob.

544
00:49:39,703 --> 00:49:41,396
(DOOR BUZZER)

545
00:49:41,496 --> 00:49:42,814
(BUZZING CONTINUES)

546
00:49:42,914 --> 00:49:43,940
Look, um...

547
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,901
- Would you be so kind?
- (BUZZER CONTINUES)

548
00:49:46,001 --> 00:49:48,820
He's actually been in the bath
for about an hour.

549
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,505
Yes, of course.

550
00:49:55,552 --> 00:49:57,704
I've called many times.

551
00:49:57,804 --> 00:50:03,001
I wanted to discuss with you
the redistribution of our parts

552
00:50:03,101 --> 00:50:07,672
in this fundamentally vulgar structure,
the triangle.

553
00:50:07,772 --> 00:50:10,133
In other words, where is she?

554
00:50:10,233 --> 00:50:13,762
I've been giving a great deal of thought
to the illogical aspects

555
00:50:13,862 --> 00:50:15,555
of your anger and your defence.

556
00:50:15,655 --> 00:50:17,057
Is Anna with you?

557
00:50:17,157 --> 00:50:18,767
And if?

558
00:50:18,867 --> 00:50:22,020
I would only ask to have a talk with her.

559
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:24,356
What if I said no?

560
00:50:24,456 --> 00:50:27,192
I'm sorry I used violence with you.

561
00:50:27,292 --> 00:50:32,155
Now I'd only apply my psychic process
to make her come to me.

562
00:50:32,255 --> 00:50:34,533
Oh, I'm so sorry, she's not here.

563
00:50:34,633 --> 00:50:37,536
Did I tell you I had a wife
and a daughter?

564
00:50:37,636 --> 00:50:38,828
No!

565
00:50:38,928 --> 00:50:40,580
They live in Cincinnati.

566
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,040
What does that do for you?

567
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:44,543
They will always remain my first family.

568
00:50:44,643 --> 00:50:48,421
Anna could be the second
and you and Bob in some sense.

569
00:50:48,521 --> 00:50:50,340
Do you have a dog?

570
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:52,008
Would that I had.

571
00:50:52,108 --> 00:50:53,802
You misuse me.

572
00:50:53,902 --> 00:50:58,181
It's stiff and blocked men like you that
lead us to the concentration camp.

573
00:50:58,281 --> 00:51:02,852
Who are the crusaders of every
blind principle, so-called ideology

574
00:51:02,952 --> 00:51:05,480
humanity invents to strangle me?

575
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:07,232
Why don't you like me?

576
00:51:07,332 --> 00:51:10,151
Why don't you draw in
the plentitude of my love

577
00:51:10,251 --> 00:51:13,363
and pull it all over your life
like a veil?

578
00:51:13,463 --> 00:51:15,532
OK, I like you.

579
00:51:15,632 --> 00:51:19,678
And I can tell you where Anna lives.

580
00:51:21,971 --> 00:51:23,498
Lives?

581
00:51:23,598 --> 00:51:27,294
Only... I don't know the guy's name.

582
00:51:27,394 --> 00:51:30,088
It's impossible. It doesn't make sense.

583
00:51:30,188 --> 00:51:31,506
Why not?

584
00:51:31,606 --> 00:51:34,676
Because you think you've given her
the supreme pleasure?

585
00:51:34,776 --> 00:51:39,948
You with your yin-yang balls
dangling from your zen brain.

586
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:44,603
OK, maybe it does boil down to
a sexual contest, in which case...

587
00:51:44,703 --> 00:51:47,580
I'm sure you win hands down.

588
00:51:49,332 --> 00:51:51,526
- But is that all?
- BOB: Nee-Na, nee-Na.

589
00:51:51,626 --> 00:51:53,862
Nee-Na, nee-Na, nee-Na.

590
00:51:53,962 --> 00:51:55,905
(BOB CONTINUES)

591
00:51:56,005 --> 00:51:58,550
I used to be afraid of you.

592
00:51:59,926 --> 00:52:01,536
But I don't think I am any more.

593
00:52:01,636 --> 00:52:05,140
There's nothing to fear except God.

594
00:52:07,058 --> 00:52:08,643
Whatever that means to you.

595
00:52:12,313 --> 00:52:14,190
For me God is a disease.

596
00:52:26,202 --> 00:52:30,273
That's why through the disease
we can reach God.

597
00:52:30,373 --> 00:52:33,693
"Tracking something," said Winnie-the-Pooh
very mysteriously.

598
00:52:33,793 --> 00:52:36,112
"Tracking what?" said Piglet,
coming closer.

599
00:52:36,212 --> 00:52:40,158
"That's just what I ask myself.
I ask myself, What?"

600
00:52:40,258 --> 00:52:41,951
"What do you think you'll answer?"

601
00:52:42,051 --> 00:52:44,137
He wants to say good night to you.

602
00:52:45,764 --> 00:52:47,223
Thank you.

603
00:52:51,603 --> 00:52:53,755
You smell clean.

604
00:52:53,855 --> 00:52:56,024
Do you like Helen?

605
00:52:58,026 --> 00:52:59,636
I think so.

606
00:52:59,736 --> 00:53:01,596
Are you not sure?

607
00:53:01,696 --> 00:53:03,598
Well, I don't know her yet.

608
00:53:03,698 --> 00:53:05,308
Do you like her?

609
00:53:05,408 --> 00:53:07,435
Yes, and who don't you like?

610
00:53:07,535 --> 00:53:10,772
Well, I don't like Heinrich

611
00:53:10,872 --> 00:53:13,900
and I don't like that sailboat.

612
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,502
Why? He's funny.

613
00:53:16,544 --> 00:53:18,129
I don't like...

614
00:53:19,339 --> 00:53:22,050
I don't like Mummy to like him
more than us.

615
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,121
Who's prettier? Mummy or Helen?

616
00:53:26,221 --> 00:53:28,331
Who do you think is prettier?

617
00:53:28,431 --> 00:53:29,833
You tell me.

618
00:53:29,933 --> 00:53:31,810
Our Mummy.

619
00:53:38,149 --> 00:53:39,818
Good night, son.

620
00:53:47,534 --> 00:53:49,327
Thank you.

621
00:53:51,329 --> 00:53:53,732
Do you have anyone to help you with him?

622
00:53:53,832 --> 00:53:57,610
Oh it's... It's not a problem. I...

623
00:53:57,710 --> 00:53:59,279
I have plenty of time.

624
00:53:59,379 --> 00:54:03,241
Bob won't say anything to me.
He keeps his words for himself.

625
00:54:03,341 --> 00:54:08,079
He knows everything, senses everything.
Children are amazing.

626
00:54:08,179 --> 00:54:09,664
Yeah.

627
00:54:09,764 --> 00:54:13,351
After lunch we have an hour's rest.

628
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:17,422
Bob very often goes to sleep.

629
00:54:17,522 --> 00:54:20,842
When he does he cries or shouts.

630
00:54:20,942 --> 00:54:22,510
Does he do it at home?

631
00:54:22,610 --> 00:54:24,070
No.

632
00:54:25,196 --> 00:54:26,264
Oh.

633
00:54:26,364 --> 00:54:28,516
He screams.

634
00:54:28,616 --> 00:54:31,519
It is very difficult to calm him down.

635
00:54:31,619 --> 00:54:34,898
When he wakes up he pretends
that nothing happened.

636
00:54:34,998 --> 00:54:36,958
What can I say?

637
00:54:40,336 --> 00:54:42,906
I'm at war against women.

638
00:54:43,006 --> 00:54:45,492
They... have no foresight.

639
00:54:45,592 --> 00:54:49,596
There's nothing about them that is stable,
there's nothing to trust.

640
00:54:51,097 --> 00:54:52,916
They're dangerous.

641
00:54:53,016 --> 00:54:57,045
There is nothing in common among women
except menstruation.

642
00:54:57,145 --> 00:54:58,713
Excuse me.

643
00:54:58,813 --> 00:55:03,551
I come from a place where evil seems
easier to pinpoint

644
00:55:03,651 --> 00:55:06,304
because you can see it in the flesh.

645
00:55:06,404 --> 00:55:11,392
It becomes people so you know exactly
the danger of being deformed by it.

646
00:55:11,492 --> 00:55:14,979
Which doesn't mean I admire your world.

647
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:19,834
But I find pathetic these stories of women
contaminating the universe.

648
00:55:21,461 --> 00:55:22,821
I'm...

649
00:55:22,921 --> 00:55:25,615
I'm one of the contaminated.

650
00:55:25,715 --> 00:55:28,034
Because you never feel free, do you?

651
00:55:28,134 --> 00:55:31,304
So sad that for you freedom
seems to mean evil.

652
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:34,849
And what about lack of freedom?

653
00:55:36,976 --> 00:55:38,645
It's extraordinary.

654
00:55:48,237 --> 00:55:49,864
All right.

655
00:55:50,907 --> 00:55:54,410
Together we can listen if Bob cries out.

656
00:56:19,394 --> 00:56:22,021
You don't have to make love to me.

657
00:56:27,443 --> 00:56:29,696
I'm not trying.

658
00:56:33,866 --> 00:56:36,144
(BOB SCREAMING)

659
00:56:36,244 --> 00:56:37,645
What happened?

660
00:56:37,745 --> 00:56:40,106
I want Mummy! My Mummy!

661
00:56:40,206 --> 00:56:44,527
- Mummy! My Mummy! Mummy! Mummy!
- It's OK. It's all right.

662
00:56:44,627 --> 00:56:47,363
- It's OK. It's all right.
- Mummy! Mummy! Mummy!

663
00:56:47,463 --> 00:56:50,325
- It's all right. It's all right.
- Mummy! Mummy! Mummy!

664
00:56:50,425 --> 00:56:53,036
(BOB WHIMPERS)

665
00:56:53,136 --> 00:56:56,748
(WHISPERS) It's all right. It's all right.
It's all right.

666
00:56:56,848 --> 00:57:00,059
It's all right. Sh!

667
00:57:11,362 --> 00:57:12,931
I'm sorry.

668
00:57:13,031 --> 00:57:15,241
It wasn't very wise of me.

669
00:57:17,243 --> 00:57:20,413
This makes you think
you've been right all along.

670
00:57:23,124 --> 00:57:24,567
Hello, Bob.

671
00:57:24,667 --> 00:57:27,211
CHILDREN: I'm the big boss here.

672
00:57:28,629 --> 00:57:31,299
You're the little boss.

673
00:57:46,272 --> 00:57:50,802
Good morning. I phoned you at home
then I thought I might catch you here.

674
00:57:50,902 --> 00:57:54,597
I didn't tell you where
Bob goes to school.

675
00:57:54,697 --> 00:57:57,642
It wasn't difficult.
We have a minor problem here.

676
00:57:57,742 --> 00:57:58,726
Yes?

677
00:57:58,826 --> 00:58:02,355
The detective who was in charge of tracing
your wife didn't come home last night.

678
00:58:02,455 --> 00:58:03,439
So?

679
00:58:03,539 --> 00:58:06,442
He wasn't at home this morning and
he hasn't reported to the office.

680
00:58:06,542 --> 00:58:07,902
Before we start to get worried...

681
00:58:08,002 --> 00:58:11,114
When was he going to check it?
Yesterday or today?

682
00:58:11,214 --> 00:58:12,198
I don't know.

683
00:58:12,298 --> 00:58:13,783
Please don't misunderstand me.

684
00:58:13,883 --> 00:58:17,161
That detective could've gotten drunk
and spent the night with whores,

685
00:58:17,261 --> 00:58:20,498
although that's not much likely.
He could have died of a heart attack

686
00:58:20,598 --> 00:58:23,710
If our detective doesn't show up
by noon I'll have to notify the police.

687
00:58:23,810 --> 00:58:26,587
The police will start digging into your
problem. That's how it is.

688
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:28,339
You and I can claim professional secrecy

689
00:58:28,439 --> 00:58:30,800
but you have to give me the address
the detective gave you.

690
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:33,594
Sebastianstrasse 87, floor 1.

691
00:58:33,694 --> 00:58:36,014
Have you been to that address yourself
or telephoned?

692
00:58:36,114 --> 00:58:37,557
- No.
- Very sensible of you.

693
00:58:37,657 --> 00:58:39,392
But may I ask why not?

694
00:58:39,492 --> 00:58:42,562
I had the impression that you were
tremendously interested

695
00:58:42,662 --> 00:58:43,830
in finding your wife.

696
00:58:44,872 --> 00:58:46,524
Yes, I was.

697
00:58:46,624 --> 00:58:49,027
I suppose I still am.

698
00:58:49,127 --> 00:58:53,131
But that was out of pure, blind ambition.

699
00:58:54,382 --> 00:58:56,050
And you know something?

700
00:58:57,301 --> 00:59:01,055
I don't feel like there's anything
much ambitious left in me.

701
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:06,018
I see.

702
00:59:08,521 --> 00:59:12,675
So I don't even have to ask you
as a personal favour

703
00:59:12,775 --> 00:59:15,945
not to come to the office
until I contact you.

704
00:59:17,363 --> 00:59:18,489
Why?

705
00:59:19,532 --> 00:59:23,770
Precisely because of the...
delicacy of your feelings,

706
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:26,647
you might be able to understand that...

707
00:59:26,747 --> 00:59:30,651
my interest in the case comes
