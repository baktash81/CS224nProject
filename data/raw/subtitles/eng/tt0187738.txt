2
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,428
First time giving blood?

3
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,931
Yes.

4
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,060
They pay cash here.

5
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,687
And there's no limit
to how many times you give.

6
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:04,814
They even buy it
in the jar.

7
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:07,984
Jared Nomak,
we're ready for you.

8
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:24,292
In the past 12 months,
have you gotten a tattoo,

9
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:27,295
or undergone any ear,
skin, or body piercings?

10
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:28,838
No.

11
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:31,341
Where did you get
that scar on your chin?

12
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,552
Childhood accident.

13
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:37,597
You say you don't have
any immediate next of kin,

14
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:40,183
- is that right?
- Not that I'm in contact with.

15
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:42,352
Nobody to call in case
of an emergency?

16
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,020
No one.

17
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:46,690
- No family?
- I told you, no.

18
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:51,111
Are you telling me
I can't be a donor?

19
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,488
It depends.
We came up

20
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:55,573
with some unusual results
on your blood test.

21
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,575
What?

22
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,536
How unusual?

23
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:02,580
Let me explain.

24
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:05,417
Your blood has
a very rare phenotype,

25
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,877
one we haven't
encountered before.

26
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:14,259
What? What are you
talking about?

27
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:17,762
- Who are you? No.
- Sit down, please.

28
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,474
What is this?

29
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:26,354
This is a good news-bad news
scenario, Jared.

30
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:28,189
Good news for us...

31
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,360
bad news...

32
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,406
...for you.

33
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,055
Forget what you think
you know--

34
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,891
vampires exist.

35
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:51,106
My name is Blade.

36
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:54,818
I was born half human,
half vampire.

37
00:03:56,361 --> 00:04:00,031
They call me
"The Daywalker."

38
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,285
I have all their strengths,

39
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:07,163
none of their weaknesses.

40
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,749
Except for the thirst.

41
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:14,295
20 years ago I met a man
that changed that.

42
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:17,799
Whistler.

43
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,677
He taught me how to hold
the thirst at bay.

44
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,179
Taught me the rules.

45
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:25,849
Gave me the weapons
to hunt with.

46
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:29,477
Silver, garlic,

47
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,688
sunlight.

48
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,357
Two years ago
he was attacked.

49
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:36,026
They took him,

50
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:39,446
and turned him into
the thing I hate most.

51
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:43,867
I should have
finished him off.

52
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:46,161
Now I'm hunting him.

53
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,416
I will find him.

54
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,836
And nothing will stand
in my way.

55
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:19,819
Daywalker's here!
Stop him!

56
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:35,752
Where is he?

57
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,798
Hey!

58
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,203
No, no.

59
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:25,630
Take me to him, and I'll
consider you a loose end.

60
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,733
Catch you later.

61
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:31,941
Old man... look at what
they've done to you.

62
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,747
Let's go home.

63
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,255
Lock up your daughters,
boys and girls,

64
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,091
the dark knight returns.

65
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:27,140
- Need a toke of the smokage, B?
- Later.

66
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,351
Cut the lights.

67
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:36,691
You found him.

68
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,198
You didn't kill him.

69
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:46,910
Give me a hand.

70
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,998
I got a bad feeling
about this, B.

71
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:57,379
Listen to his breathing.
He's already dying. He's in pain.

72
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,422
Why don't you just put him
out of his misery right now?

73
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,508
They had him on stasis
in a halfway house.

74
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:05,428
I'm giving him an accelerated
retro-viral detox.

75
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:08,765
Like a heroin addict.

76
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,809
Make him go cold turkey
in one night.

77
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:12,644
Shit ain't
going to work, man.

78
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:14,813
I say you kill the motherfucker
right now.

79
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:16,648
Get out.

80
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,993
If there's anything left
of you in there, Whistler,

81
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:31,454
listen up.

82
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:35,458
In the morning those blinds
are going to open

83
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,669
whether you're cured...

84
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,671
or not.

85
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,893
Hey, man,
I didn't mean to call him--

86
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:36,311
Listen to me, Blade.

87
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,938
You're going to have
to finish me off.

88
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:40,398
No.

89
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:43,943
Give me
that damn gun.

90
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:52,243
Now walk away.

91
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:54,913
Stubborn son of a bitch.

92
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:48,633
How do you feel?

93
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,807
Like hammered shit.

94
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:01,563
How'd you find me?

95
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:05,900
I started out in Moscow.
Then Romania.

96
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:10,905
- They kept moving you around.
- How long was I gone?

97
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:16,870
- Months?
- Too long.

98
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,086
Years.

99
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:29,966
They tortured me
almost to death.

100
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:33,094
And then let me heal
in a vat of blood

101
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:36,097
so they could go
at it again.

102
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:40,268
Sorry sons of bitches
could have at least

103
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,645
fixed my goddamn leg
while they were at it.

104
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:48,360
Where's my arc welder?

105
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,378
What's up? Nice to meet you.
I heard a lot about you.

106
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:09,923
I'm Josh. You can call me "Scud."
Everybody does.

107
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:23,770
Tell me something, Skid--

108
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:26,189
No, man, it's "Scud,"
like "Stud".

109
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:27,941
Whatever.

110
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:31,027
- What are you doing here?
- The pimpmobile?

111
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:33,613
Just a little aftermarket
modification.

112
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:35,115
- Nitrous oxide and shit like that.
- Oh, yeah.

113
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:37,784
You gave it a more aggressive
exhaust profile ramping.

114
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:41,037
The whole package will crank
that Betty up, maybe 300 horsepower.

115
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:44,290
You'll burn the thing out
before your next oil change.

116
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:47,252
Where did you dig up
this shitbird, anyway?

117
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:49,170
What the fuck
is your problem, Poppy?

118
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:52,340
My problem is I've been
sucking blood clots for two years.

119
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:55,844
I get out to find some jerkoff
fucking with my life's work.

120
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:58,346
We jeopardized our whole
operation to save your ass!

121
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,848
- Our operation?
- Yeah.

122
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:03,852
Our operation? I built
this operation, you ass-wipe!

123
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:10,025
Motion sensors!
lt's on three, gentlemen.

124
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:11,943
Human?

125
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:15,697
Body temperature, 50.
I'd guess suckhead.

126
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:25,040
Fried. They're using
magnesium flares.

127
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:28,293
They've got your security
system scoped out.

128
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:32,422
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I don't trust you--

129
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:18,760
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

130
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:20,178
Cool outfit.

131
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:29,688
Guard lights!

132
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:30,016
We represent the ruling body
of the Vampire Nation.

133
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:33,395
They are offering you
a truce.

134
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,189
They want to meet
with you.

135
00:22:39,818 --> 00:22:41,528
Scud.

136
00:22:43,738 --> 00:22:46,199
Take off your mask.

137
00:22:51,621 --> 00:22:55,500
My name is Asad.
This is Nyssa.

138
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:01,423
You have been our most
feared enemy.

139
00:23:01,506 --> 00:23:04,968
But now there's something else
loose on the streets.

140
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:07,595
Something worse
than you.

141
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:24,446
What's so funny?

142
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:28,241
They tell stories about Blade
as the Bogeyman.

143
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:30,118
Frankly,
I'm disappointed.

144
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:34,456
You hear that, B?
She's disappointed.

145
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:38,001
He agreed
to come along so easily.

146
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:41,796
Come on, B, show her.
Pretty please?

147
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:46,676
Semtex.

148
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,847
Enough explosives
to level a city block.

149
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:55,352
You still disappointed?

150
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:20,418
The guards look human.
They're probably familiars.

151
00:24:38,728 --> 00:24:40,772
You sure about this?

152
00:24:40,897 --> 00:24:43,316
Well, if I'm not...

153
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:57,706
The true power
of the Vampire Nation lies here.

154
00:25:09,843 --> 00:25:11,302
Father?

155
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:22,897
Blade, this is
Overlord Eli Damaskinos.

156
00:25:27,652 --> 00:25:30,405
It has been said,
"Be proud of your enemy

157
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,615
and enjoy his success."

158
00:25:32,741 --> 00:25:35,702
In that regard,
I should thank you.

159
00:25:35,827 --> 00:25:38,621
- For what?
- Eliminating Deacon Frost.

160
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:41,958
You did us a favor.
Karel Kounen.

161
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:47,005
- You're human.
- Barely. I'm a lawyer.

162
00:25:47,088 --> 00:25:49,299
European Health Consortium.

163
00:25:49,382 --> 00:25:52,719
As you may know,
Vampirism is...

164
00:25:52,802 --> 00:25:57,974
a horrible virus, carried
in the saliva of predators.

165
00:25:58,099 --> 00:26:01,978
In 72 hours, it spreads through
the human bloodstream,

166
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:05,523
creating new
parasitic organs.

167
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:07,275
Like cancer.

168
00:26:09,152 --> 00:26:12,489
Cancer with a purpose.

169
00:26:14,074 --> 00:26:16,743
Unfortunately,
viruses evolve, too.

170
00:26:16,826 --> 00:26:18,912
We've encountered
a new one.

171
00:26:18,995 --> 00:26:20,830
We dubbed it
the Reaper Strain.

172
00:26:20,914 --> 00:26:25,335
And like any good pathogen,
it appears to have found a carrier.

173
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,136
There...
Jared Nomak.

174
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:39,724
Born a vampire,
but an anomaly like you.

175
00:26:41,226 --> 00:26:43,395
Unlike the rest of us,
however,

176
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:46,314
he feeds on not just humans,

177
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:49,359
but vampires as well.

178
00:26:49,442 --> 00:26:53,279
- Looks like he was doing me a favor.
- You're missing the point.

179
00:26:53,405 --> 00:26:55,407
Their vampire victims
don't die...

180
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:59,285
they turn.
They become carriers.

181
00:26:59,411 --> 00:27:02,330
You've got to understand.
These things are like crack addicts.

182
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:07,168
They need to feed daily.
Nomak's been up for 72 hours.

183
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:11,047
By our estimates, there are already
a dozen Reapers.

184
00:27:11,172 --> 00:27:13,591
There'll be hundreds
before the week is out.

185
00:27:13,717 --> 00:27:17,679
Thousands within a matter of months.
Do the math.

186
00:27:17,804 --> 00:27:19,723
Wait. Let me get
this right.

187
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:23,977
You want me
to hunt them... for you?

188
00:27:24,102 --> 00:27:25,395
When they are finished
with us,

189
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,732
who do you think
they'll turn on next?

190
00:27:28,815 --> 00:27:31,484
Your precious humans.

191
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:35,405
Not one of them
will be left.

192
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:38,241
We spent two years training
a small tactical unit--

193
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:40,994
The Bloodpack.
We want you to lead them.

194
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:43,121
Two years?

195
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:46,666
We've been training
to hunt you.

196
00:27:50,211 --> 00:27:52,130
So, B-man,
what do you think?

197
00:27:52,213 --> 00:27:54,466
Sounds like a plan.

198
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:56,551
What do you really think?

199
00:27:56,634 --> 00:27:59,471
They're going to fuck us
the first chance they get.

200
00:28:01,014 --> 00:28:03,975
So, we ain't
gonna do this, right?

201
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,019
We'll play along for now.

202
00:28:06,102 --> 00:28:09,022
They'll take us in deeper
than we've ever been.

203
00:28:09,105 --> 00:28:12,025
Get a chance to see
how their world really ticks.

204
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:14,527
I had enough of their world.

205
00:28:14,611 --> 00:28:16,571
They're just shitting bricks

206
00:28:16,654 --> 00:28:19,657
because they're no longer
top of the food chain.

207
00:28:19,824 --> 00:28:23,536
Damn, man,
I'm really worried about him.

208
00:28:23,661 --> 00:28:25,538
I know he's
your friend and all,

209
00:28:25,663 --> 00:28:27,874
but I think you should
watch him.

210
00:28:27,999 --> 00:28:32,379
Nobody goes cold turkey
from the thirst in just one night.

211
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:16,006
Looking to get
hooked up?

212
00:29:16,131 --> 00:29:18,508
Maybe.
What do you have?

213
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:20,176
No problem.

214
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:24,723
Horse, Hawaiian lce,
whatever you need.

215
00:29:24,848 --> 00:29:27,559
Whatever I need.

216
00:29:27,642 --> 00:29:31,438
I like that.
What if I need you?

217
00:29:46,161 --> 00:29:48,288
So, so sweet.

218
00:30:24,991 --> 00:30:27,994
They are ready
whenever you are, Daywalker.

219
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:44,511
Blade,
meet The Bloodpack.

220
00:30:46,137 --> 00:30:49,849
Lighthammer,
Verlaine,

221
00:30:49,974 --> 00:30:53,812
Priest,
Snowman,

222
00:30:53,895 --> 00:30:56,648
Chupa,
and Reinhardt.

223
00:31:10,412 --> 00:31:12,288
Hey, um...

224
00:31:12,372 --> 00:31:14,708
me and the gang
were wondering...

225
00:31:17,752 --> 00:31:20,296
What was that?

226
00:31:20,422 --> 00:31:23,299
Can you blush?

227
00:31:23,383 --> 00:31:25,885
Here we go.

228
00:31:28,805 --> 00:31:31,141
Oh, I get it.

229
00:31:31,266 --> 00:31:33,059
I see now.

230
00:31:33,184 --> 00:31:36,855
You've been training for two years
to take me out.

231
00:31:36,938 --> 00:31:39,607
And now, here I am.

232
00:31:39,733 --> 00:31:43,486
Ooh, so exciting,
isn't it?

233
00:31:43,611 --> 00:31:46,406
Okay, here's your chance.

234
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:51,745
Come on.
What are you waiting for?

235
00:31:51,828 --> 00:31:53,663
Here I am.
Right here in front of you.

236
00:31:53,747 --> 00:31:56,332
Adolf here gets the first shot.
Come on.

237
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:59,502
What are you looking at her for?
You need permission?

238
00:31:59,586 --> 00:32:01,671
Maybe you need
a little bit of incentive.

239
00:32:01,755 --> 00:32:03,715
Okay, I can help
with that.

240
00:32:06,051 --> 00:32:08,053
What's the matter?
Missed that?

241
00:32:08,136 --> 00:32:09,846
It's okay,
I can do it again.

242
00:32:13,558 --> 00:32:16,269
Come on.
What, do you need a manual?

243
00:32:16,353 --> 00:32:17,979
- Do it!
- Kill the bastard!

244
00:32:25,904 --> 00:32:29,699
Now you've got an explosive device
stuck to the back of your head.

245
00:32:29,783 --> 00:32:33,703
Silver nitrate. Rigged to go off
if anybody tampers with it.

246
00:32:33,787 --> 00:32:35,955
I'll have
the detonator with me.

247
00:32:36,081 --> 00:32:39,959
And you-- if you so much
as look at me wrong--

248
00:32:43,672 --> 00:32:46,341
From now on
we work as a unit.

249
00:32:46,466 --> 00:32:49,511
You'll be taking
orders from me.

250
00:32:51,054 --> 00:32:53,181
Any questions?

251
00:32:58,812 --> 00:33:00,480
Good.

252
00:33:03,108 --> 00:33:06,486
You want to catch the hunter?
You start with the prey.

253
00:33:06,569 --> 00:33:12,617
We'll target all the night places
where vampires congregate.

254
00:33:12,742 --> 00:33:14,327
Blood banks, safe houses.

255
00:33:14,452 --> 00:33:16,913
The bigger the better.

256
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:20,792
So... what's first?

257
00:33:24,212 --> 00:33:26,423
The House of Pain.

258
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:42,272
Where's the entrance?

259
00:33:42,355 --> 00:33:43,857
I don't see any signs.

260
00:33:43,982 --> 00:33:46,443
No vampire glyphs.

261
00:33:46,526 --> 00:33:50,280
No, because of you,
we've had to rethink our habits,

262
00:33:50,405 --> 00:33:52,949
tighten our security.

263
00:33:54,576 --> 00:33:56,619
Have a closer look.

264
00:34:03,668 --> 00:34:05,795
Nice.

265
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,672
.38, .45
and 9mm caliber.

266
00:34:07,797 --> 00:34:10,175
All with foil capsules
at the tip

267
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,344
filled with silver nitrate,
and garlic extract.

268
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:14,512
This hyper-velocity
stake gun

269
00:34:14,637 --> 00:34:17,932
spits out a silver stake
at 6,000 feet per second.

270
00:34:18,016 --> 00:34:20,268
Since you suckers
don't like sunlight,

271
00:34:20,393 --> 00:34:24,189
we've modified the gun's
entry light with a UV filter.

272
00:34:24,272 --> 00:34:26,983
Pop it open--
instant UV light.

273
00:34:28,818 --> 00:34:30,737
Filter's on,
no problem.

274
00:34:30,862 --> 00:34:32,447
Yo, B, check this out.

275
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:34,783
It's got an pneumatic
syringe delivery system.

276
00:34:34,908 --> 00:34:37,660
The vials are filled with
an anti-coagulant called EDTA.

277
00:34:37,786 --> 00:34:40,955
One punch with this, you'll blow
your target up like a balloon.

278
00:34:41,081 --> 00:34:43,875
The cartridge ejects.
Automatic reload.

279
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,877
Nice.

280
00:34:47,212 --> 00:34:50,757
- Let's go.
- You won't pass for one of us.

281
00:34:50,882 --> 00:34:54,803
- Like I give a shit.
- No, he's right.

282
00:34:54,928 --> 00:34:57,097
Why don't you post up
on the roof over there?

283
00:34:57,222 --> 00:34:59,683
Cover our backs.

284
00:34:59,766 --> 00:35:03,770
So the Bloodpack's calling
the shots now, huh?

285
00:35:03,895 --> 00:35:06,022
Great.

286
00:35:07,941 --> 00:35:11,319
Better curb that dog of yours
or we'll do it for you.

287
00:35:14,948 --> 00:35:17,117
Keep pushing, asshole.

288
00:35:34,092 --> 00:35:35,927
I ya, I against I

289
00:35:36,011 --> 00:35:38,430
Flesh of my flesh
and mind of my mind

290
00:35:38,513 --> 00:35:40,557
Two of a kind,
but one won't survive

291
00:35:40,682 --> 00:35:43,101
My images reflect
in the enemy's eye

292
00:35:43,184 --> 00:35:45,937
And his images reflect
in mine the same time

293
00:35:46,021 --> 00:35:48,064
I ya, I ya, I against l

294
00:35:48,189 --> 00:35:51,026
Flesh of my flesh
and mind of my mind

295
00:35:51,151 --> 00:35:53,236
Two of a kind,
but one won't survive

296
00:35:53,361 --> 00:35:55,280
Survive, survive,
survive.

297
00:36:01,453 --> 00:36:03,329
We're in.

298
00:36:11,129 --> 00:36:13,673
You're about
to enter our world.

299
00:36:13,798 --> 00:36:16,843
You will see things--
feeding.

300
00:36:16,968 --> 00:36:19,721
Just remember
why you're here.

301
00:36:19,804 --> 00:36:21,973
I haven't forgotten.

302
00:36:35,028 --> 00:36:37,405
What exactly
are we looking for in here?

303
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:40,492
Anything that looks
suspicious.

304
00:36:47,332 --> 00:36:49,834
You got to be
kidding me.

305
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:46,057
Scud, do you read me?

306
00:37:49,019 --> 00:37:52,564
- Scud, you reading me?
- Reading you loud and clear.

307
00:37:52,689 --> 00:37:54,566
The whole place
is a safe house.

308
00:37:54,691 --> 00:37:57,068
The windows are painted black,
one access door.

309
00:37:57,193 --> 00:38:01,448
- 200, 300 suckheads in here.
- That sounds cool.

310
00:38:01,573 --> 00:38:03,867
Hey, W, you got me?

311
00:38:06,077 --> 00:38:07,954
W?

312
00:38:11,291 --> 00:38:14,044
Tell me something,
how's the weather up there?

313
00:38:14,169 --> 00:38:18,006
Walkin' on sunshine,
toad boy.

314
00:38:23,428 --> 00:38:25,680
Look at them.
Half of these bastards,

315
00:38:25,764 --> 00:38:28,516
they're not even
pure bloods.

316
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:33,271
I tell you what, why don't we
just fucking kill everyone?

317
00:38:33,355 --> 00:38:35,023
Just to make sure.

318
00:38:39,277 --> 00:38:41,529
God, it would be
so easy.

319
00:38:58,171 --> 00:39:00,340
He's got you.

320
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:32,956
Daywalker.

321
00:40:47,405 --> 00:40:49,491
Mother's milk.

322
00:40:49,574 --> 00:40:53,161
I say we got about half an hour
till sunrise, Cinderella.

323
00:40:53,244 --> 00:40:54,788
Hurry up.

324
00:41:12,597 --> 00:41:14,307
I spotted one,
but lost it.

325
00:41:14,432 --> 00:41:16,518
Be on the lookout.

326
00:41:25,694 --> 00:41:27,404
Fuck.

327
00:42:55,241 --> 00:42:57,660
Whistler, they're
on the roof.

328
00:42:57,744 --> 00:42:59,454
I got them on the roof
of my bus.

329
00:43:23,812 --> 00:43:25,730
Shhh.

330
00:44:26,499 --> 00:44:28,835
Nomak.

331
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,546
Daywalker.

332
00:44:31,629 --> 00:44:34,382
What am I to you?

333
00:44:34,466 --> 00:44:37,469
Is the enemy
of my enemy my friend...

334
00:44:37,594 --> 00:44:39,637
or my enemy?

335
00:44:58,490 --> 00:44:59,741
We're under attack!

336
00:44:59,866 --> 00:45:01,618
There's three of them.
Probably more.

337
00:45:11,753 --> 00:45:13,296
Daylight.

338
00:46:57,317 --> 00:46:59,778
Silver don't do jack shit.
Don't waste the bullets!

339
00:46:59,903 --> 00:47:03,323
- Motherfucker.
- You hear me, Chupa?

340
00:47:03,448 --> 00:47:05,075
Say, "cheese."

341
00:47:22,384 --> 00:47:24,260
Come on.

342
00:48:03,008 --> 00:48:04,926
How about some daylight,
motherfucker?

343
00:50:01,459 --> 00:50:03,378
Fuck!

344
00:51:00,852 --> 00:51:03,938
Listen to me. lf you're under attack,
use your UV lights.

345
00:51:04,105 --> 00:51:06,441
Use your UV lights.
They can't take the light.

346
00:51:55,699 --> 00:51:58,910
Priest?
We're not dying here.

347
00:51:59,035 --> 00:52:02,288
- Come on.
- Priest is down.

348
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:10,296
Daylight's coming.
You're on your own, Blade.

349
00:52:34,362 --> 00:52:37,490
You want me so bad, Blade?

350
00:52:37,574 --> 00:52:39,659
Here I am.

351
00:52:42,245 --> 00:52:44,622
Why kill me?

352
00:52:46,791 --> 00:52:50,086
You and l,
we have the same enemy.

353
00:52:50,211 --> 00:52:51,838
We want the same thing.

354
00:54:30,687 --> 00:54:32,689
We need the same thing,
Blade.

355
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:26,993
What happened?

356
00:55:27,077 --> 00:55:28,995
Why didn't you tell me
these things

357
00:55:29,079 --> 00:55:32,123
- were immune to silver and garlic?
- I didn't know.

358
00:55:32,248 --> 00:55:34,709
If you did,
would you have told me?

359
00:55:35,919 --> 00:55:38,880
I think you know the truth
when you hear it.

360
00:55:39,047 --> 00:55:41,216
Mm-hmm.
Then why didn't he kill you?

361
00:55:47,597 --> 00:55:49,516
How long since
he's been bitten?

362
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:52,686
- About 20 minutes.
- His skin is fucking burning.

363
00:55:52,769 --> 00:55:54,854
He's already starting
to change.

364
00:55:57,941 --> 00:56:00,735
Will someone just
shut him the fuck up?

365
00:56:19,713 --> 00:56:21,548
Hold on !

366
00:56:21,631 --> 00:56:24,134
- Hold him, Chupa!
- Come on, man !

367
00:56:24,259 --> 00:56:26,011
Put him
out of his fucking misery!

368
00:56:27,762 --> 00:56:30,140
Don't you get it?
You can't finish him that way!

369
00:56:30,265 --> 00:56:32,767
Hold him down !
Hold him down, Chupa!

370
00:56:36,938 --> 00:56:38,314
Move.

371
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:44,154
Back off!

372
00:56:57,125 --> 00:56:59,502
If that was
your Bloodpack Sunday punch,

373
00:56:59,627 --> 00:57:02,380
- we're in trouble.
- This motherfucker left his post.

374
00:57:02,464 --> 00:57:05,258
- He just disappeared.
- Where were you?

375
00:57:05,383 --> 00:57:07,427
Ran into a little Reaper
action myself.

376
00:57:07,594 --> 00:57:09,763
Oh, yeah?
How little?

377
00:57:09,929 --> 00:57:11,556
We lost a man.
Priest.

378
00:57:11,681 --> 00:57:12,640
You want me to carve
his name on your chest?
