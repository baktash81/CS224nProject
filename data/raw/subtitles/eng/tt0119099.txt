1
00:00:37,683 --> 00:00:40,948
I want to tell you
about the time I almost died.

2
00:00:59,271 --> 00:01:01,432
I never thought it would happen to me.

3
00:01:01,506 --> 00:01:02,973
Not at this age.

4
00:01:03,542 --> 00:01:04,531
Beaten...

5
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:06,334
...outsmarted.

6
00:01:07,112 --> 00:01:09,945
How did I get into this fix?
How did it all begin?

7
00:01:10,549 --> 00:01:13,313
If I go back to the beginning
that'll take forever.

8
00:01:13,385 --> 00:01:15,979
So let's start more recently.

9
00:01:16,788 --> 00:01:18,119
Somewhere.

10
00:01:18,557 --> 00:01:19,785
Anywhere.

11
00:01:21,193 --> 00:01:22,524
Reese.

12
00:01:55,661 --> 00:01:57,822
I thought the governor
didn't approve of this.

13
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,758
The more they don't approve,
the more they want to watch.

14
00:02:01,967 --> 00:02:05,266
So what is this, six notches on your belt?

15
00:02:05,504 --> 00:02:06,596
Eight.

16
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,270
Congratulations.

17
00:02:09,441 --> 00:02:10,430
Fuck you.

18
00:02:10,609 --> 00:02:12,509
Ask me more nicely, huh?

19
00:02:12,678 --> 00:02:13,940
John Hobbes.

20
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,770
Wanted in dance hall.

21
00:02:31,196 --> 00:02:32,390
Edgar Reese.

22
00:02:33,031 --> 00:02:34,623
Well, well, well.

23
00:02:34,966 --> 00:02:36,297
Look who's here.

24
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,066
It's the brilliant detective
who sealed my brutish fate.

25
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:42,367
That's right.

26
00:02:44,643 --> 00:02:46,736
So what is this?
They making you famous now?

27
00:02:46,812 --> 00:02:50,646
Big time. They're gonna put me
in the movies. Documentary.

28
00:02:50,816 --> 00:02:54,252
Courtesy of the ACLU.
They'll shoot me getting smoked.

29
00:02:56,588 --> 00:02:59,113
Who knows?
Maybe it'll be a big video rental.

30
00:02:59,191 --> 00:03:01,921
All these society ladies showing it
to their dinner guests:

31
00:03:01,993 --> 00:03:04,894
"You see that there?
That's a urine stain, ladies."

32
00:03:05,497 --> 00:03:07,397
"Oh, my, it's not urine."

33
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,092
It's good to see you, Hobbes.

34
00:03:10,168 --> 00:03:12,329
It's good to be seen by you, Reese.

35
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,500
You're...

36
00:03:17,542 --> 00:03:19,100
...my best pal.

37
00:03:33,692 --> 00:03:35,250
You're still a good fella.

38
00:03:57,716 --> 00:03:59,047
Open the gate.

39
00:04:02,387 --> 00:04:04,378
You remind me of somebody, Hobbes.

40
00:04:04,723 --> 00:04:06,782
Indeed you do.

41
00:04:07,192 --> 00:04:08,420
Indeed you do.

42
00:04:09,394 --> 00:04:10,861
Do you like riddles?

43
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:12,255
No, I don't.

44
00:04:13,732 --> 00:04:15,393
Here's a beaut.

45
00:04:16,401 --> 00:04:17,732
Why is there...

46
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:21,136
...a space between Lyons and Spakowsky?

47
00:04:22,007 --> 00:04:22,666
What?

48
00:04:22,908 --> 00:04:26,571
Come on. You should know this one, pal.
You should know this one.

49
00:04:26,912 --> 00:04:29,210
Open your eyes. Look around sometime.

50
00:04:35,587 --> 00:04:36,849
Open the gate.

51
00:04:38,323 --> 00:04:39,881
Remember this, Hobbes.

52
00:04:40,826 --> 00:04:41,986
A day...

53
00:04:42,661 --> 00:04:44,925
...a week, a month.

54
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,099
What are you, a Nazi now?

55
00:04:51,603 --> 00:04:52,695
It's Dutch.

56
00:04:53,171 --> 00:04:54,832
What goes around...

57
00:04:55,841 --> 00:04:57,433
...really goes around.

58
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,634
You have a safe trip.

59
00:05:01,112 --> 00:05:02,704
I'll be looking for ya.

60
00:05:10,455 --> 00:05:12,923
What goes around really goes around.

61
00:05:18,096 --> 00:05:19,688
Howdy, folks.

62
00:05:19,798 --> 00:05:21,493
Ladies, gents...

63
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,625
...cocksuckers, pederasts...

64
00:05:24,035 --> 00:05:26,902
...I hope you all enjoy the show. Yes, I do.

65
00:06:41,947 --> 00:06:45,041
I'll give you a blowjob
if you get me out of this baby.

66
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,559
"Time

67
00:06:57,996 --> 00:07:00,191
"Is on my side

68
00:07:00,465 --> 00:07:01,796
"Yes, it is

69
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,561
"Time

70
00:07:05,003 --> 00:07:06,937
"Is on my side

71
00:07:07,505 --> 00:07:09,132
"Yes, it is

72
00:07:09,641 --> 00:07:11,609
"Now you always say

73
00:07:11,977 --> 00:07:14,138
"That you want to be free

74
00:07:14,512 --> 00:07:17,345
"But I'll come running back

75
00:07:17,816 --> 00:07:20,944
"I'll come running back to you"

76
00:07:23,021 --> 00:07:25,819
Baby, come on, go ahead...

77
00:07:25,957 --> 00:07:27,822
...light up my life!

78
00:07:57,589 --> 00:08:00,114
Something is always happening.

79
00:08:00,792 --> 00:08:04,728
But when it happens,
people don't always see it...

80
00:08:06,297 --> 00:08:07,855
...or understand it...

81
00:08:09,467 --> 00:08:11,025
...or accept it.

82
00:09:21,439 --> 00:09:23,532
The criminals don't accept consequences.

83
00:09:24,042 --> 00:09:28,274
They kill. It's not their fault.
This is the consequence of what I do.

84
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:30,711
- Look who made it.
- Mr. Consequence, how'd it go?

85
00:09:30,882 --> 00:09:32,873
- He died.
- Told you.

86
00:09:33,118 --> 00:09:34,312
Get one more.

87
00:09:34,652 --> 00:09:35,983
Nice to see you.

88
00:09:36,121 --> 00:09:37,713
How you doing, Gracie?

89
00:09:38,623 --> 00:09:40,887
- Don't tempt me with that.
- Sorry.

90
00:09:41,059 --> 00:09:43,152
What's your poison? We got some Becks.

91
00:09:43,228 --> 00:09:45,719
We got some Guinness.
We got some Bass.

92
00:09:47,298 --> 00:09:48,993
- Budweiser's good for me.
- Budweiser?

93
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:50,056
- Yeah.
- Good.

94
00:09:50,135 --> 00:09:52,069
No, we're going imported here.

95
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,968
- You can't afford it. I'll buy.
- I can afford it. Budweiser.

96
00:09:56,007 --> 00:09:59,170
At least have a Bud Ice
or a Bud Dry or something.

97
00:09:59,644 --> 00:10:01,635
It is just a Bud, okay?

98
00:10:02,747 --> 00:10:04,510
- You guys want anything?
- No.

99
00:10:04,582 --> 00:10:05,742
Here's your Bud.

100
00:10:05,817 --> 00:10:08,285
He was one of the most
notorious inmates.

101
00:10:08,486 --> 00:10:09,612
Here you go.

102
00:10:09,754 --> 00:10:11,153
Thank you, sweetheart.

103
00:10:12,757 --> 00:10:14,452
You're an unusual cop, Hobbes.

104
00:10:14,592 --> 00:10:15,581
Really?

105
00:10:16,127 --> 00:10:20,086
I've been in this precinct about what,
five, six months?

106
00:10:20,265 --> 00:10:22,699
Everybody says,
"Hobbes don't take no cream."

107
00:10:22,767 --> 00:10:24,667
"Hobbes don't take no cream."

108
00:10:24,836 --> 00:10:26,201
Now is that true, or what?

109
00:10:27,505 --> 00:10:28,938
No, I don't like cream.

110
00:10:29,007 --> 00:10:30,099
That means no?

111
00:10:30,441 --> 00:10:31,601
Yeah, it means no.

112
00:10:31,776 --> 00:10:35,439
Now, is that "no" as in never,
"no" as in sometimes...

113
00:10:35,613 --> 00:10:38,480
...or "no" as in I do
but I don't like to talk about it?

114
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,108
"No" as in never.

115
00:10:43,354 --> 00:10:45,345
This is a big city, Hobbesy.

116
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,082
We got a tradition to uphold.

117
00:10:47,158 --> 00:10:50,559
Got something wrong with your ears?
The man says something, he says it.

118
00:10:50,628 --> 00:10:51,720
So, hypothetical...

119
00:10:51,796 --> 00:10:55,732
...a cop who's trying to make ends meet
wants a little something on the side...

120
00:10:56,301 --> 00:10:57,791
I don't like cream...

121
00:10:57,869 --> 00:10:59,234
...and I don't judge.

122
00:10:59,537 --> 00:11:00,970
You don't judge?

123
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:02,902
He's a fucking saint, huh?

124
00:11:02,974 --> 00:11:05,534
So you're telling me
that under no circumstances...

125
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:08,372
...would a holy man like you ever,
you know...

126
00:11:08,546 --> 00:11:10,707
...break the law or do something...

127
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,210
Look, Lou...

128
00:11:14,986 --> 00:11:18,922
...I could jump across the table,
snatch your heart out of your chest...

129
00:11:19,057 --> 00:11:21,924
...squeeze the blood out,
and stick it in your front pocket.

130
00:11:21,993 --> 00:11:23,017
Oh, yeah?

131
00:11:23,328 --> 00:11:25,819
If I lost control. But if I did...

132
00:11:26,331 --> 00:11:28,856
...l'd be no different
than the people we bust.

133
00:11:29,801 --> 00:11:32,099
Now, as to your general question...

134
00:11:32,537 --> 00:11:35,267
You take any cop on the force,
cream or no...

135
00:11:35,473 --> 00:11:39,307
...ninety-nine percent of the time
they're doing their job, aren't they?

136
00:11:39,611 --> 00:11:40,600
Ninety-nine five.

137
00:11:40,678 --> 00:11:42,009
Point five.

138
00:11:42,247 --> 00:11:44,545
So he or she, cream or no...

139
00:11:45,016 --> 00:11:48,179
...is doing more good out there every day...

140
00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:51,618
...than any lawyer or a stockbroker or...

141
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:54,752
...president of the United States
can ever do in their lifetime.

142
00:11:57,695 --> 00:11:59,322
Cops are the chosen people.

143
00:11:59,397 --> 00:12:00,523
Amen.

144
00:12:09,374 --> 00:12:11,137
Guess I'm switching to Bud.

145
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:15,279
Gracie, come here
and get this foreign shit off my table...

146
00:12:15,346 --> 00:12:17,143
...and bring me three Buds.

147
00:13:39,297 --> 00:13:41,265
Damn it, what took you so long?

148
00:13:42,633 --> 00:13:46,000
You know what you'd look like
with this sandwich up your ass?

149
00:13:46,838 --> 00:13:48,066
Pardon me?

150
00:13:48,172 --> 00:13:51,608
Like a fat, stupid fuck
with a sandwich up his ass.

151
00:13:52,643 --> 00:13:54,838
Charles, I hate to do this, but...

152
00:13:54,979 --> 00:13:57,209
Put the job where the sandwich goes.

153
00:14:18,836 --> 00:14:19,996
Hello?

154
00:14:21,739 --> 00:14:22,899
Hello?

155
00:14:25,343 --> 00:14:26,503
Hello?

156
00:14:36,587 --> 00:14:39,784
Here we go. Juice, pretzels...

157
00:14:40,358 --> 00:14:41,450
...apple...

158
00:14:41,592 --> 00:14:44,083
...peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

159
00:14:44,262 --> 00:14:46,787
Uncle John, will you please
make my lunch tomorrow?

160
00:14:46,864 --> 00:14:48,024
Here's Toby.

161
00:14:49,801 --> 00:14:52,133
I can't be having the same thing every day.

162
00:14:52,203 --> 00:14:55,070
What do you want,
peanut butter and jelly sandwich?

163
00:14:56,941 --> 00:14:58,602
Jelly and peanut butter?

164
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,644
I love you, Dad.

165
00:15:02,947 --> 00:15:05,040
Don't forget your Uncle Johnny.

166
00:15:05,216 --> 00:15:07,650
I feel the love in this room, man.

167
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,112
- Bye.
- Be good.

168
00:15:11,222 --> 00:15:13,554
- Have a good day at school.
- Okay. Bye.

169
00:15:16,794 --> 00:15:18,056
Doing a good job, Art.

170
00:15:18,129 --> 00:15:19,323
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

171
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:22,358
Why don't you sit down with me?
Let's talk a bit.

172
00:15:22,433 --> 00:15:23,695
You're not in a hurry?

173
00:15:23,768 --> 00:15:25,565
No, no...

174
00:15:25,837 --> 00:15:27,429
Relax today.

175
00:15:27,572 --> 00:15:29,733
Besides, what are they going to do?
Fire me?

176
00:15:31,976 --> 00:15:33,409
- How you doing?
- Okay.

177
00:15:33,478 --> 00:15:35,275
- You all right?
- Yeah.

178
00:15:39,317 --> 00:15:40,784
I love you, Johnny.

179
00:15:45,089 --> 00:15:48,320
You ever think it would be easier,
your life would be easier...

180
00:15:48,459 --> 00:15:51,428
...if maybe me and Sam
were not living with...

181
00:15:51,896 --> 00:15:52,988
No, no.

182
00:15:55,433 --> 00:15:58,027
- Maybe Marcy wouldn't have left.
- Later for Marcy.

183
00:15:58,169 --> 00:15:59,966
If she loved me, she never would've left.

184
00:16:00,037 --> 00:16:02,767
Besides, family's always first.
You're my brother.

185
00:16:07,111 --> 00:16:08,442
I love you, too.

186
00:16:11,349 --> 00:16:14,716
But don't make the boy any more
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.

187
00:16:14,785 --> 00:16:17,151
- No more peanut butter and jelly.
- Okay.

188
00:16:58,229 --> 00:17:00,060
A cop knows.

189
00:17:00,565 --> 00:17:01,896
A cop sees.

190
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:06,199
Even the most casual thing, it registers.

191
00:17:09,507 --> 00:17:12,169
Often you don't remember till later on.
But then...

192
00:17:12,243 --> 00:17:14,677
...you look back and you realize...

193
00:17:16,347 --> 00:17:17,746
...you knew.

194
00:17:22,587 --> 00:17:24,248
Good morning, Detective.

195
00:17:24,755 --> 00:17:26,450
How you doing, Lieutenant?

196
00:17:26,691 --> 00:17:28,352
Look who's feeling good today.

197
00:17:28,526 --> 00:17:31,427
Hey, what can I say?
You're looking better than me.

198
00:17:32,096 --> 00:17:33,427
Got a call on 4, Hobbes.

199
00:17:33,698 --> 00:17:35,256
Thank you, Denise.

200
00:17:37,201 --> 00:17:39,101
How's everything today? Good?

201
00:17:40,538 --> 00:17:41,869
Detective Hobbes.

202
00:17:41,939 --> 00:17:43,566
Pal, you got a pen?

203
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:45,668
4541...

204
00:17:45,776 --> 00:17:48,006
...South Stender, Apartment 2.

205
00:17:48,613 --> 00:17:49,739
Who's there?

206
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,711
A clue, Magoo.

207
00:17:55,252 --> 00:17:56,879
Couldn't sleep last night.

208
00:17:56,954 --> 00:17:58,114
Who can?

209
00:17:59,724 --> 00:18:03,216
Remember I used to get calls at two or
three o'clock in the morning from Reese?

210
00:18:03,294 --> 00:18:05,159
He loved you. He truly did.

211
00:18:05,229 --> 00:18:07,356
Somebody called me last night.

212
00:18:07,665 --> 00:18:08,996
Imagine that.

213
00:18:09,233 --> 00:18:10,427
Denise.

214
00:18:10,601 --> 00:18:14,196
Send a car to 4541 South Stender,
Apartment 2.

215
00:18:14,271 --> 00:18:15,863
Make sure we gain entry.

216
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:16,964
Got a body?

217
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:21,307
No, it's probably some knucklehead,
saw me on TV trying to impress his girl.

218
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:23,504
- How'd I look last night?
- Fabulous.

219
00:18:23,581 --> 00:18:25,412
You saw that? Four different channels.

220
00:18:25,483 --> 00:18:26,973
You're a god. You're a god.

221
00:18:33,157 --> 00:18:36,593
Name's Muskavich. Russian expatriate.

222
00:18:36,761 --> 00:18:39,457
Super says no family,
no friends, no nothing.

223
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:41,420
Why is he dead, then?

224
00:18:43,334 --> 00:18:44,665
What do you got?

225
00:18:46,604 --> 00:18:48,367
I got puncture wounds.

226
00:18:49,306 --> 00:18:51,501
Look for a syringe, or something.

227
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,168
Eighteen.

228
00:18:54,612 --> 00:18:57,137
- What is that, his 18th victim?
- Could be.

229
00:18:58,282 --> 00:18:59,510
Could be.

230
00:19:09,593 --> 00:19:11,185
Very tidy.

231
00:19:11,362 --> 00:19:14,388
The DO A's been dead awhile,
so what the hell is this?

232
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,960
Killer slept over and then...

233
00:19:17,134 --> 00:19:19,034
...had a nice, neat breakfast.

234
00:19:19,203 --> 00:19:20,534
Looks like.

235
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:24,838
Check this out.

236
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,446
Shit.

237
00:19:37,988 --> 00:19:38,977
What?

238
00:19:39,223 --> 00:19:40,451
It's a riddle.

239
00:19:41,492 --> 00:19:45,394
Reese, in his cell before he died,
he asked me, "Why is there a space...

240
00:19:45,563 --> 00:19:47,656
"...between Lyons and Spakowsky?"

241
00:19:48,632 --> 00:19:49,621
Yeah?

242
00:19:54,672 --> 00:19:56,071
Accomplice?

243
00:19:56,507 --> 00:19:58,566
Reese had an accomplice?

244
00:19:59,009 --> 00:20:01,534
Unless it's a copycat. Maybe the...

245
00:20:01,912 --> 00:20:05,245
...prison guards or the people
that made that documentary.

246
00:20:05,316 --> 00:20:07,511
- You got a minute?
- I'll be there in a second.

247
00:20:07,585 --> 00:20:10,486
Fifty people must have seen
that documentary by now.

248
00:20:10,554 --> 00:20:12,419
Me and Jonesy will run them down.

249
00:20:14,859 --> 00:20:16,053
Yeah, good.

250
00:20:16,961 --> 00:20:19,429
Fingerprint. Perp wore no gloves.

251
00:20:19,563 --> 00:20:22,930
Left prints on the spoon and cereal bowl
like he was advertising.

252
00:20:23,534 --> 00:20:25,525
Maybe his prints aren't in the system.

253
00:20:25,603 --> 00:20:26,695
I hate to be stupid...

254
00:20:26,771 --> 00:20:28,102
Enjoy it, Lou.

255
00:20:28,372 --> 00:20:30,704
...but is motive still something
we think about...

256
00:20:30,775 --> 00:20:33,869
...or is it that all these
crimes are done out of sickness?

257
00:20:34,779 --> 00:20:35,643
Number 2.

258
00:20:35,713 --> 00:20:37,203
Everything is motive.

259
00:20:37,481 --> 00:20:39,244
Sickness is motive.

260
00:20:39,383 --> 00:20:40,577
Look sharp.

261
00:20:40,885 --> 00:20:42,477
The coroner's prelim on the Ruski.

262
00:20:42,553 --> 00:20:45,647
Isn't that the wacko poison
that Reese used on them Arab kids?

263
00:20:50,561 --> 00:20:52,051
Tiff...

264
00:20:52,229 --> 00:20:55,995
You like riddles?
You know, puzzles and shit? Brainteasers?

265
00:20:56,066 --> 00:20:57,693
Sure, only if I do the teasing.

266
00:20:58,235 --> 00:21:02,399
Why is there a space
between Lyons and Spakowsky?

267
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,304
What does that even mean? Come on!

268
00:21:05,376 --> 00:21:07,173
We had a Spakowsky in my rookie year.

269
00:21:07,244 --> 00:21:08,575
South precinct.

270
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,072
Come again?

271
00:21:11,215 --> 00:21:13,513
Not your Spakowsky. This guy's a cop.

272
00:21:13,717 --> 00:21:15,014
Keep talking.

273
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:17,082
Guy's a fucking asshole.

274
00:21:17,254 --> 00:21:20,417
He's the King Kong of assholes.
He's a fucking legend.

275
00:21:21,091 --> 00:21:22,581
His name's up on a wall.

276
00:21:26,931 --> 00:21:27,920
What?

277
00:21:30,835 --> 00:21:33,998
Some chief in the '30s
thought it would boost morale.

278
00:21:34,438 --> 00:21:38,636
They kept it up till '81 or '82,
and it got to be like a booby prize.

279
00:21:38,943 --> 00:21:40,774
It was downtown in the lobby...

280
00:21:40,845 --> 00:21:44,008
...till they remodeled.
Must've passed it by 1,000 times.

281
00:21:44,114 --> 00:21:47,777
I guess I need to open my eyes
and look around sometime.

282
00:21:48,018 --> 00:21:51,181
Lyons, I don't remember,
but Spakowsky was around.

283
00:21:51,522 --> 00:21:55,185
This guy was so fucking mean
his wife shot him in the foot.

284
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:56,724
Who was '65?

285
00:21:56,894 --> 00:21:58,293
Who was in that space?

286
00:21:58,362 --> 00:22:00,125
You got me, bud. I don't know.

287
00:22:01,165 --> 00:22:04,965
You're saying they took a name off?
Why would they do that?

288
00:22:05,135 --> 00:22:09,128
I don't know. I called Records.
They say they don't know who it was...

289
00:22:09,306 --> 00:22:11,137
...and don't know why it's not there.

290
00:22:11,976 --> 00:22:13,705
We better find out.

291
00:23:09,533 --> 00:23:12,093
Lieutenant, just the man I wanted to see.

292
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,200
"Robert Milano."

293
00:23:17,274 --> 00:23:18,468
That's right.

294
00:23:19,376 --> 00:23:21,276
Cop of the Year, 1965.

295
00:23:21,445 --> 00:23:25,472
Eight months later, goes up to a cabin,
middle of nowhere, dies cleaning his gun.

296
00:23:25,549 --> 00:23:29,781
So it's either two things.
He was dirty or it was a woman.

297
00:23:32,289 --> 00:23:33,278
What?

298
00:23:33,557 --> 00:23:35,957
I met him once, Milano.

299
00:23:36,393 --> 00:23:39,556
He had a poker up his ass,
but otherwise he was a good cop.

300
00:23:39,697 --> 00:23:42,393
- What I want to know is...
- I know what you want.

301
00:23:43,233 --> 00:23:44,632
I can't help you.

302
00:23:45,302 --> 00:23:46,564
Can't help me?

303
00:23:46,971 --> 00:23:48,063
Look...

304
00:23:49,139 --> 00:23:51,232
...do all of us a favor, okay?

305
00:23:51,809 --> 00:23:53,470
Whatever you find out...

306
00:23:53,744 --> 00:23:55,336
...keep it to yourself.

307
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,809
I got something for you.

308
00:24:02,186 --> 00:24:03,983
Documentary on Reese.

309
00:24:04,321 --> 00:24:06,812
Thank you. You're a real white man.

310
00:24:07,257 --> 00:24:08,417
Jonesy.

311
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:11,785
- Tape on Reese. You want to view it?
- Give me a sec.

312
00:24:12,096 --> 00:24:13,893
What do you got on Muskavich?

313
00:24:13,964 --> 00:24:15,431
Fingerprints were bust.

314
00:24:15,499 --> 00:24:18,229
The crime scene says
the killer probably had dark hair.

315
00:24:18,302 --> 00:24:19,769
He probably was left-handed.

316
00:24:19,837 --> 00:24:21,429
Yeah, like Reese.

317
00:24:21,538 --> 00:24:24,336
He had bad teeth.
Found a piece in the corn flakes.

318
00:24:25,376 --> 00:24:26,638
Directory Assistance.

319
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:28,905
Can you give me a number on a Milano...

320
00:24:29,013 --> 00:24:30,674
...Sylvia M-l-L-A-N-O.

321
00:24:30,781 --> 00:24:32,043
Hold, please.

322
00:24:32,116 --> 00:24:33,708
Hey, Lieutenant.

323
00:24:33,884 --> 00:24:35,351
Excuse me, boss.

324
00:24:38,455 --> 00:24:43,119
If somebody dies because you kept
your mouth shut, you're holding the bag.

325
00:24:43,293 --> 00:24:45,955
When it's a perfect world, let me know.

326
00:24:46,563 --> 00:24:49,794
In the meantime,
it's not me keeping his mouth shut.

327
00:24:50,367 --> 00:24:52,130
- Is that clear enough for you?
- Yeah.

328
00:24:52,369 --> 00:24:54,132
I'm sorry. There's no listing.

329
00:24:54,304 --> 00:24:57,705
Okay, thanks. No, listen, listen.
You still there? Hello?

330
00:24:57,875 --> 00:25:02,209
Check and see if there's a G. Milano,
a Gretta Milano. Can you do that for me?

331
00:25:02,379 --> 00:25:03,403
- Hold, please.
- Thanks.

332
00:25:03,514 --> 00:25:05,311
Syringe had the same prints.

333
00:25:07,317 --> 00:25:09,410
- So now what? Video time?
- Yeah.

334
00:25:11,488 --> 00:25:13,285
You know, I was thinking...

335
00:25:13,357 --> 00:25:14,756
Don't hurt yourself.

336
00:25:14,825 --> 00:25:15,814
Eat me.

337
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:17,483
Hold for the number.

338
00:25:17,828 --> 00:25:20,820
Whoever did Muskavich,
knew the poison that Reese used.

339
00:25:20,998 --> 00:25:24,024
He quotes Reese. He could be a cop.

340
00:25:24,201 --> 00:25:25,828
He could be, huh?

341
00:25:26,003 --> 00:25:27,937
Lou, could be a cop, huh?

342
00:25:28,238 --> 00:25:30,331
Please leave a message. Thank you.

343
00:25:31,675 --> 00:25:33,905
Make sure Hobbes gets a copy of this.

344
00:25:34,178 --> 00:25:37,409
You watching, Johnny-boy?
I hope you're paying close attention.

345
00:25:38,015 --> 00:25:39,505
Every gesture!

346
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,842
Every word!

347
00:25:49,693 --> 00:25:50,921
Wait a sec.

348
00:25:50,994 --> 00:25:52,086
What?

349
00:25:52,262 --> 00:25:53,752
Check something out.

350
00:26:00,204 --> 00:26:01,193
That...

351
00:26:01,538 --> 00:26:03,438
...language he was speaking...

352
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,868
...later.

353
00:26:05,042 --> 00:26:06,441
That's Dutch?

354
00:26:07,377 --> 00:26:08,867
That's what he said.

355
00:26:09,446 --> 00:26:11,937
What's he speaking now? Is that Dutch?

356
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:14,108
This now?

357
00:26:16,053 --> 00:26:18,317
This is mumbo-jumbo. Gibberish.

358
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:21,723
You sure on that?

359
00:26:41,645 --> 00:26:42,907
Who is it?

360
00:26:43,013 --> 00:26:46,642
It's detective John Hobbes.
I'm looking for Miss Gretta Milano.

361
00:26:47,985 --> 00:26:50,419
- Oh, yes. You left a message.
- Yes.

362
00:26:51,255 --> 00:26:53,746
I wanted to talk to you about your father.

363
00:26:59,997 --> 00:27:01,362
How're you doing?

364
00:27:02,266 --> 00:27:03,494
May I come in?

365
00:27:05,769 --> 00:27:07,100
Sure.

366
00:27:17,014 --> 00:27:19,710
You're surrounded by angels.

367
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:22,975
I teach theology at the university.

368
00:27:23,086 --> 00:27:25,452
I see. Very beautiful.

369
00:27:25,622 --> 00:27:26,782
Thank you.

370
00:27:27,624 --> 00:27:30,184
Why do you want to know
about my father?

371
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:36,966
It's 30 years later and the files are sealed...

372
00:27:38,635 --> 00:27:41,661
...and my boss was told to let it alone, so...

373
00:27:42,639 --> 00:27:43,833
...here I am.

374
00:27:45,709 --> 00:27:48,974
I can tell you what my mother told me
before she died.

375
00:27:50,347 --> 00:27:52,975
Why do you want to know?
Just curious, or...?

376
00:27:53,083 --> 00:27:54,107
No, ma'am.

377
00:27:54,184 --> 00:27:57,483
See, I'm the detective
who caught Edgar Reese.

378
00:27:57,554 --> 00:28:00,421
I'm not sure if you're familiar with him.
He was just...

379
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:02,424
- Yeah, I read about him.
- Right, right.

380
00:28:02,492 --> 00:28:05,154
And this Reese fella, he...

381
00:28:06,263 --> 00:28:08,993
...in a roundabout way,
gave me your father's name.

382
00:28:14,104 --> 00:28:15,696
Did Reese like to sing?

383
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,967
Yeah, he did, actually.

384
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:23,241
And at the execution,
did he try and touch you or grab you?

385
00:28:23,513 --> 00:28:25,913
Yeah, he did. He shook my hand.

386
00:28:27,918 --> 00:28:29,112
Want some coffee?

387
00:28:29,186 --> 00:28:30,346
Sure.

388
00:28:32,756 --> 00:28:34,246
Okay. One condition.

389
00:28:34,925 --> 00:28:36,517
You and I never spoke.

390
00:28:37,027 --> 00:28:40,758
You say nothing to your boss or partner.
Nothing goes in the files.

391
00:28:40,864 --> 00:28:44,425
My name and everything I say
is just between us. Agreed?

392
00:28:44,601 --> 00:28:46,466
Will I get coffee if I say yes?

393
00:28:50,107 --> 00:28:53,304
Detective, my dad was a good cop.

394
00:28:54,044 --> 00:28:57,536
Pride of the force and all that.
And then he shot himself.

395
00:28:57,714 --> 00:29:01,047
A reporter found out
my father had been under investigation.

396
00:29:01,118 --> 00:29:04,451
He'd caught a killer,
but copycat crimes started.

397
00:29:04,721 --> 00:29:07,952
Evidence mounted against him.
Fingerprints, witnesses.

398
00:29:08,091 --> 00:29:12,289
The press never got real proof,
but my father's medal was rescinded.

399
00:29:12,462 --> 00:29:13,554
I see.

400
00:29:13,964 --> 00:29:18,901
So you're saying that when he died
someone made this evidence go away?

401
00:29:19,403 --> 00:29:23,134
The mayor, governor and chief of police,
they all needed a hero.

402
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,572
Some of these people are
still important today.

403
00:29:25,642 --> 00:29:28,236
- I see.
- No. Not yet, you don't.

404
00:29:28,979 --> 00:29:33,143
My father saw the evidence,
told my mother he couldn't beat it.

405
00:29:33,383 --> 00:29:35,874
So he went to this cabin in the mountains.

406
00:29:36,086 --> 00:29:39,317
It's a place that's been
in my mother's family for generations.

407
00:29:39,923 --> 00:29:41,413
He went there and...

408
00:29:45,662 --> 00:29:46,924
The thing is...

409
00:29:47,064 --> 00:29:49,828
...I know my father was innocent
of those murders.

410
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,760
How do you know?

411
00:29:54,037 --> 00:29:55,595
How do you know he was innocent?

412
00:29:58,675 --> 00:30:01,303
It's 30 years ago.
It's not important anymore.

413
00:30:01,378 --> 00:30:03,539
It's important to me, Miss Milano.

414
00:30:03,613 --> 00:30:06,047
Don't you want the truth to come out,
the killer to be punished?

415
00:30:06,116 --> 00:30:08,414
- Of course, I do.
- But?

416
00:30:12,189 --> 00:30:16,023
Are you afraid if you tell me
your life may be in danger?

417
00:30:17,294 --> 00:30:18,352
Yeah.

418
00:30:18,528 --> 00:30:19,756
That's it?

419
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:21,654
Yes.

420
00:30:23,367 --> 00:30:24,527
Okay.

421
00:30:27,304 --> 00:30:28,601
Okay.

422
00:30:28,672 --> 00:30:30,333
Thank you very much.

423
00:30:30,507 --> 00:30:32,634
- For the coffee as well.
- Okay.

424
00:30:35,779 --> 00:30:37,144
Oh, listen...

425
00:30:37,214 --> 00:30:39,546
If I have any more questions,
can I call you?

426
00:30:40,317 --> 00:30:41,682
I'd rather you didn't.

427
00:30:48,158 --> 00:30:49,716
Detective...

428
00:30:51,328 --> 00:30:52,625
Do you believe in God?

429
00:30:53,997 --> 00:30:56,261
Yeah. I go to church every now and then.

430
00:30:57,134 --> 00:30:59,034
What I see in my line of work...

431
00:30:59,436 --> 00:31:01,267
...faith's a little hard to sustain.

432
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,898
Good luck.

433
00:31:13,617 --> 00:31:17,849
Sometimes I think the basic job
that human beings have...

434
00:31:18,021 --> 00:31:21,013
...is just to figure out
what the hell is going on.

435
00:31:21,191 --> 00:31:23,523
Example: Gretta Milano.

436
00:31:23,693 --> 00:31:27,185
What was she hiding?
What was she so scared of?

437
00:31:27,531 --> 00:31:31,262
And then her question about God.
What the hell is that all about?

438
00:31:39,176 --> 00:31:42,304
You never know.
Down to the smallest thing.

439
00:31:43,046 --> 00:31:46,812
That man who passes you
and catches your eye. Does he know you?

440
00:31:46,983 --> 00:31:51,386
Did you go to school together? Is he a
homicidal maniac who hates you on sight?

441
00:31:56,293 --> 00:31:57,624
Or is it nothing?

442
00:31:59,062 --> 00:32:00,324
Nothing at all?

443
00:32:48,945 --> 00:32:49,934
Wake up.

444
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:55,909
Go to bed.

445
00:32:58,688 --> 00:33:00,713
I know. I know.

446
00:33:00,857 --> 00:33:02,791
Here we go. Up. Up.

447
00:33:02,959 --> 00:33:05,359
I'm going, Uncle John.

448
00:33:10,133 --> 00:33:11,225
Hello?

449
00:33:12,536 --> 00:33:13,662
Hello?

450
00:33:18,975 --> 00:33:20,203
Let's go, Sam.

451
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,482
Good night.

452
00:33:31,655 --> 00:33:32,849
Good night, son.

453
00:33:37,727 --> 00:33:39,456
- Johnny?
- Yeah?

454
00:33:40,063 --> 00:33:41,530
You ever get scared?

455
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,331
Yeah, sometimes.

456
00:33:50,006 --> 00:33:51,234
Me, too.

457
00:34:03,086 --> 00:34:04,246
Good night, Art.

458
00:34:25,609 --> 00:34:28,271
- Hello?
- Mrs. Moohr? This is Charles.

459
00:34:29,045 --> 00:34:31,536
Apparently I must have gotten drunk
or something...

460
00:34:31,615 --> 00:34:33,776
...because the last few days...

461
00:34:34,851 --> 00:34:36,148
Am I working tonight?

462
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:37,481
You quit.

463
00:34:38,321 --> 00:34:39,379
I quit?

464
00:34:39,456 --> 00:34:42,721
Yes. You insulted Harry
and he hired someone else.

465
00:34:42,826 --> 00:34:44,885
But... I mean... How...?

466
00:34:48,498 --> 00:34:50,432
Look, I'm really sorry.

467
00:34:50,767 --> 00:34:54,066
Could you apologize, please,
to your husband for whatever...

468
00:34:54,137 --> 00:34:56,765
We always liked you, Charles. Goodbye.

469
00:35:17,927 --> 00:35:19,121
Hello?

470
00:35:23,433 --> 00:35:26,266
Well, well, well. Look who's here.

471
00:36:06,476 --> 00:36:09,741
I played Reese's tape on the phone
to a linguist. He's coming down.

472
00:36:09,813 --> 00:36:11,041
Yeah? Prelim?

473
00:36:11,114 --> 00:36:12,979
Said it sounded Mideastern.

474
00:36:13,216 --> 00:36:15,343
- Anything on Muskavich?
- Only the pizza.

475
00:36:15,418 --> 00:36:17,818
We're hitting your area of expertise, huh?

476
00:36:17,887 --> 00:36:19,878
Pizza is the staff of life.

477
00:36:20,223 --> 00:36:23,989
Without pizza and other fine Italian foods,
there would be no happiness.

478
00:36:24,394 --> 00:36:26,021
There was one slice left.

479
00:36:26,096 --> 00:36:28,656
Garlic, linguiça and pineapple.

480
00:36:29,032 --> 00:36:31,830
Plus there was nothing
in Muskavich's stomach.

481
00:36:32,001 --> 00:36:33,298
So it was the killer's eats.

482
00:36:33,369 --> 00:36:36,270
Hell of a clue. You better write
that one up for the journal.

483
00:36:36,339 --> 00:36:39,399
I will, Lou. And I will laud you copiously.

484
00:36:39,843 --> 00:36:40,832
Thank you.

485
00:36:40,944 --> 00:36:43,037
Detectives? Your guy's in video.

486
00:36:44,447 --> 00:36:46,108
The linguist guy's here.

487
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:48,240
I'll be right there.

488
00:36:51,821 --> 00:36:52,845
Any luck?

489
00:36:52,989 --> 00:36:55,423
John Hobbes, Professor Richard Louders.

490
00:36:55,525 --> 00:36:57,220
- How do you do?
- Pleasure.

491
00:36:57,293 --> 00:36:59,284
This is completely exhilarating.

492
00:36:59,362 --> 00:37:01,694
Who is this convict? Can I speak to him?

493
00:37:02,098 --> 00:37:04,123
Not now. Have a seat.

494
00:37:04,467 --> 00:37:08,164
Professor says it's a language.
He's just never heard it spoken aloud.

495
00:37:08,238 --> 00:37:10,206
- Meaning?
- Some kind of antique.

496
00:37:10,373 --> 00:37:14,707
I believe this is a Biblical tongue.
Syrian Aramaic.

497
00:37:15,211 --> 00:37:17,475
Only a few nomadic tribes still use it.

498
00:37:17,547 --> 00:37:19,208
So you don't know what he's saying?

499
00:37:19,282 --> 00:37:20,772
Haven't the faintest.

500
00:37:21,117 --> 00:37:23,017
He's not too pleasant, is he?

501
00:37:24,387 --> 00:37:27,515
But if you'd spare me a copy,
I'd be more than happy to work it.

502
00:37:27,924 --> 00:37:31,758
Appreciate it. If you could wait
out front for 15 minutes...

503
00:37:32,061 --> 00:37:33,653
...we'll dupe one off for you.

504
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:35,061
I'll be waiting.

505
00:37:35,465 --> 00:37:37,729
- See you in a minute.
- Bye, Detective.

506
00:37:43,573 --> 00:37:46,098
- Syrian Aramaic.
- Imagine that.

507
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:50,507
I got something else, too.
I'm looking up this clipping...

508
00:37:50,647 --> 00:37:53,115
...of Reese, high-school baseball team.

509
00:37:53,817 --> 00:37:55,307
He bats right.

510
00:37:56,319 --> 00:37:57,650
He throws right.

511
00:37:59,556 --> 00:38:01,217
What are you saying, Hobbes?

512
00:38:01,291 --> 00:38:03,691
Reese pulled off the sickest shit on record.

513
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:08,094
He speaks a language 2,000 years old and
you're worried about his ambidexterity?

514
00:38:08,264 --> 00:38:09,891
I'm worried about everything.

515
00:38:09,966 --> 00:38:12,093
- Hobbes, call on Line 1.
- Thank you, Bill.

516
00:38:15,338 --> 00:38:16,532
Detective Hobbes.

517
00:38:16,606 --> 00:38:18,938
Hey, pal, need another clue?

518
00:38:19,609 --> 00:38:21,668
1339 South Grove...

519
00:38:22,111 --> 00:38:23,373
...Apartment 9.

520
00:38:27,717 --> 00:38:30,277
Jonesy, that pizza place
with the number 1 7?

521
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,612
Is that close to Grove?

522
00:38:32,956 --> 00:38:34,184
I think so.

523
00:38:50,373 --> 00:38:52,204
They're in the same place...

524
00:38:52,375 --> 00:38:53,535
...exactly.

525
00:38:57,547 --> 00:38:59,879
- It's like he's laughing at us.
- He is.

526
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:09,158
Cash, not check?

527
00:39:09,392 --> 00:39:10,381
That's right.

528
00:39:18,768 --> 00:39:20,235
Take a look at this.

529
00:39:24,574 --> 00:39:26,166
What the hell is this?

530
00:39:34,684 --> 00:39:36,242
You know what's scary?

531
00:39:38,354 --> 00:39:42,757
I'm going home last night, this guy's
walking past me, he's going the other way.

532
00:39:43,526 --> 00:39:45,494
He looks me right in the eye.

533
00:39:45,595 --> 00:39:48,758
The kind of look like he knows you.
You know what I mean?

534
00:39:53,536 --> 00:39:55,629
It's the same guy in the bathtub.

535
00:39:55,939 --> 00:39:57,668
- The stiff.
- You're shitting me.

536
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,435
I shit you not. Same guy.

537
00:40:01,244 --> 00:40:02,734
Oh, man.

538
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,039
I ain't smart enough to figure this out.

539
00:40:06,115 --> 00:40:07,207
Me, neither.

540
00:40:07,383 --> 00:40:08,645
Under the sink.

541
00:40:13,256 --> 00:40:14,314
Same poison?

542
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:17,052
Same poison.
Better get that down to the lab.

543
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,154
- What else you got?
- The number on his chest.

544
00:40:20,396 --> 00:40:22,956
Last Thursday it's 18, now it's 2?

545
00:40:23,066 --> 00:40:27,196
Everything's under a Charles Olom,
but it looks like that's an alias.

546
00:40:27,337 --> 00:40:29,464
So we're running his prints.

547
00:40:38,247 --> 00:40:41,580
Quote Yogi Berra,
"It's like déjà vu all over again."

548
00:40:41,751 --> 00:40:43,378
- You mean Reese?
- Yeah.

549
00:40:46,255 --> 00:40:47,813
Whoever is doing it...

550
00:40:48,491 --> 00:40:50,322
...has a thing for Hobbes.

551
00:40:50,493 --> 00:40:51,755
Seems like.

552
00:40:53,496 --> 00:40:54,690
How is he?

553
00:40:54,831 --> 00:40:56,162
Who, Hobbes?

554
00:40:57,266 --> 00:40:59,666
How is he ever? He's fine. He's great.

555
00:41:00,436 --> 00:41:03,132
If it starts to work at him,
let me know, okay?

556
00:41:04,374 --> 00:41:06,808
And if it starts to work on me,
I'll let you know.

557
00:41:29,565 --> 00:41:31,192
I thought that was you.

558
00:41:31,334 --> 00:41:32,995
What are you doing, more...

559
00:41:33,136 --> 00:41:34,728
...historical research?

560
00:41:38,074 --> 00:41:40,338
Nice talking to you. See you Monday.

561
00:41:40,877 --> 00:41:42,003
All right, Lou.

562
00:41:43,946 --> 00:41:45,675
Come on, Jimmy.

563
00:41:45,782 --> 00:41:47,215
Over here, shoot it!

564
00:41:47,283 --> 00:41:48,944
Shoot it, shoot it!

565
00:41:49,118 --> 00:41:51,211
Come on, come on, Sam. Okay.

566
00:41:51,888 --> 00:41:53,583
That's okay, that's okay.

567
00:41:53,856 --> 00:41:55,255
Score is tied.

568
00:41:55,591 --> 00:41:57,252
No, 19 to 1 7.

569
00:41:57,894 --> 00:41:59,122
You can take him.

570
00:41:59,195 --> 00:42:00,958
- Pass the ball.
- I'm open.

571
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:02,688
Take the ball back.

572
00:42:04,667 --> 00:42:07,568
Johnny's going to make a point.
He's got the ball.

573
00:42:07,637 --> 00:42:09,662
- Hiya, Art.
- How you doing?

574
00:42:09,906 --> 00:42:12,272
Good one! Three, two, one!

575
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:16,007
That's it for me. I gotta go.

576
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:18,274
No, I gotta go. I have a long drive.

577
00:42:18,414 --> 00:42:19,745
Art, get in here.

578
00:42:19,816 --> 00:42:21,909
Uncle John, but he's a spaz.

579
00:42:22,452 --> 00:42:25,683
You don't disrespect your father, okay?
You understand me?

580
00:42:25,922 --> 00:42:27,412
Cherish what you got.

581
00:42:28,758 --> 00:42:30,089
Get on in there.

582
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:32,184
- You want some?
- I didn't bring my shoes.

583
00:42:32,261 --> 00:42:33,250
Come on.

584
00:42:34,597 --> 00:42:35,621
What's up?

585
00:42:35,698 --> 00:42:38,098
- Tiffany didn't get you?
- No, what's up?

586
00:42:38,267 --> 00:42:40,326
You know how weird this case is?

587
00:42:41,671 --> 00:42:43,605
We got a positive I. D...

588
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,773
...on Charles Olom.

589
00:42:46,742 --> 00:42:48,437
Real name's Mickey Noons.

590
00:42:48,845 --> 00:42:51,006
Born in Canada, illegal alien.

591
00:42:51,314 --> 00:42:53,680
Blah, blah, blah. Smalltime shithead.

592
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:55,281
That ain't bad.

593
00:42:55,451 --> 00:42:56,611
That ain't it.

594
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:01,852
Noons killed the Ruski. It's his prints
all over Muskavich's apartment.

595
00:43:02,024 --> 00:43:03,013
What?

596
00:43:03,626 --> 00:43:06,220
Let's see, Noons poisons Muskavich...

597
00:43:06,496 --> 00:43:09,488
...dumps him in the tub,
sets out the corn flakes.

598
00:43:10,199 --> 00:43:13,464
Three days later somebody does
the exact same thing to him.

599
00:43:14,003 --> 00:43:17,234
Exact, because Noons and Muskavich
were killed by the same person.

600
00:43:17,306 --> 00:43:18,739
Some kind of ringmaster?

601
00:43:18,808 --> 00:43:20,139
I think so.

602
00:43:20,243 --> 00:43:23,041
Hey, Art.
You and Sam don't forget lunch, all right?

603
00:43:23,746 --> 00:43:26,544
I don't know.
I can't seem to get my mind around it.

604
00:43:27,717 --> 00:43:29,309
I got a bad feeling about this.

605
00:43:29,652 --> 00:43:30,880
Me, too.

606
00:43:31,821 --> 00:43:34,483
Somebody's playing with my dick
and it ain't me.

607
00:43:36,292 --> 00:43:37,725
Yeah. See you.

608
00:43:39,896 --> 00:43:41,830
- Ten minutes, Art!
- Okay.

609
00:45:24,233 --> 00:45:26,667
There are moments which mark your life.

610
00:45:27,103 --> 00:45:30,163
Moments when you realize
nothing will ever be the same.

611
00:45:30,539 --> 00:45:33,667
And time is divided into two parts:

612
00:45:34,777 --> 00:45:36,142
Before this...

613
00:45:36,712 --> 00:45:38,111
...and after this.

614
00:46:08,878 --> 00:46:11,438
Sometimes you can feel
such a moment coming.

615
00:46:12,848 --> 00:46:15,646
That's the test. Or so I tell myself.

616
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:18,787
I tell myself that at times like that...

617
00:46:19,488 --> 00:46:23,049
...strong people keep
moving forward anyway...

618
00:46:25,494 --> 00:46:27,724
...no matter what they're going to find.

619
00:49:43,125 --> 00:49:45,525
- Miss Milano.
- Oh, hello.

620
00:49:47,196 --> 00:49:49,357
I went to your place in the mountains.

621
00:49:50,633 --> 00:49:52,464
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

622
00:49:52,535 --> 00:49:54,230
Let me get that for you.

623
00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:56,267
Trees and the water...

624
00:49:56,338 --> 00:49:58,932
Absolutely beautiful.
What does "Azazel" mean?

625
00:50:01,043 --> 00:50:05,377
Your father wrote it in the basement
on the wall, then he painted over it.

626
00:50:06,048 --> 00:50:07,481
My dictionary...

627
00:50:07,716 --> 00:50:09,479
...says that it's the...

628
00:50:09,652 --> 00:50:11,244
..."evil spirit of the wilderness."

629
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,878
Whatever that means.

630
00:50:13,055 --> 00:50:15,888
One of the books your father had up there
talks about demons...

631
00:50:15,958 --> 00:50:17,926
...and how they move by touch.

632
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:19,618
Walk away, Mr. Hobbes.

633
00:50:20,029 --> 00:50:22,156
- Say again?
- Lf you enjoy your life...

634
00:50:22,231 --> 00:50:25,723
...if there's even one human being
you care about, don't take this case.

635
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:34,576
It's out of my hands, Miss Milano.
I mean, it's my job.

636
00:50:36,645 --> 00:50:38,010
Bye, Mr. Hobbes.

637
00:50:39,315 --> 00:50:40,339
That's it?

638
00:50:40,416 --> 00:50:41,906
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

639
00:50:57,032 --> 00:50:58,431
- Fax.
- Thanks.

640
00:51:01,403 --> 00:51:05,305
Phone company sent MUDs and LUDs
for Noons' and Muskavich's apartments.

641
00:51:05,374 --> 00:51:07,103
See those calls there?

642
00:51:07,309 --> 00:51:09,971
They were made right around
the time they were killed.

643
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:13,705
You saying the killer called me
from the crime scene?

644
00:51:13,782 --> 00:51:14,908
Sure looks like it.

645
00:51:14,984 --> 00:51:17,748
- Reese used to call me at night.
- Reese is dead.

646
00:51:17,853 --> 00:51:20,549
Whoever's doing this
is in league with Reese...

647
00:51:20,689 --> 00:51:24,352
...or was imitating Reese.
I know he's still calling my house.

648
00:51:24,893 --> 00:51:26,952
How many times I got to change
my phone number?

649
00:51:27,029 --> 00:51:29,998
The more you change it, the more it
looks like someone on the inside.

650
00:51:30,065 --> 00:51:31,362
Like a cop?

651
00:51:32,067 --> 00:51:33,125
Yeah.

652
00:51:39,141 --> 00:51:40,631
It's nothing to me...

653
00:51:40,843 --> 00:51:43,038
...but the egos upstairs...

654
00:51:44,913 --> 00:51:46,574
- You hear me?
- Both ears.

655
00:51:52,121 --> 00:51:55,056
I'm going to lose my sense of humor.
What do you got?

656
00:51:55,457 --> 00:51:57,015
Translation from the Aramaic.

657
00:51:57,893 --> 00:51:59,861
"I can't enter you by touch.

658
00:52:00,029 --> 00:52:03,829
"But even when I can get inside you,
after I'm spirit, I won't.

659
00:52:04,366 --> 00:52:07,733
"I'll fuck you up and down, left and right."
That's in the Bible.

660
00:52:07,803 --> 00:52:09,998
"If that doesn't work, I have other ways."

661
00:52:10,072 --> 00:52:12,006
We need a translation of the translation.

662
00:52:22,718 --> 00:52:24,117
Anything else?

663
00:52:24,887 --> 00:52:26,582
No, I'm okay. Thanks.

664
00:53:02,191 --> 00:53:03,522
I like the night.

665
00:53:03,859 --> 00:53:05,121
The street.

666
00:53:05,294 --> 00:53:06,784
The smells.

667
00:53:07,296 --> 00:53:09,389
The sense of another world.

668
00:53:14,970 --> 00:53:17,871
Sometimes you come
face to face with yourself.

669
00:55:19,194 --> 00:55:20,183
Now...

670
00:55:20,295 --> 00:55:21,762
...put that card back in.

671
00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:23,727
- Anywhere.
- All right.

672
00:55:25,367 --> 00:55:27,767
- Tell me when to stop, okay?
- Okay.

673
00:55:28,003 --> 00:55:30,198
Can you pronounce it for me again?

674
00:55:32,541 --> 00:55:35,271
Okay, Professor, I think I got it. All right.

675
00:55:59,167 --> 00:56:01,965
I can get inside you.
After I'm spirit, I won't.

676
00:56:02,471 --> 00:56:03,460
No.

677
00:56:03,906 --> 00:56:05,635
Better I get you for real.

678
00:56:07,242 --> 00:56:07,936
Fuck you...

679
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:11,138
...up, down, left, right, coming, going.

680
00:56:11,914 --> 00:56:13,905
I'll get so close to you...

681
00:56:14,449 --> 00:56:16,417
...so close it breaks you.

682
00:56:18,086 --> 00:56:19,917
And if that doesn't work...

683
00:56:20,155 --> 00:56:21,645
...I have other ways.

684
00:56:22,758 --> 00:56:24,282
I have so many...

685
00:56:24,459 --> 00:56:25,756
...many ways.

686
00:56:44,379 --> 00:56:45,368
Right.

687
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:47,013
Fifteen minutes.

688
00:56:50,752 --> 00:56:52,219
Hi. Can I help you?

689
00:56:54,356 --> 00:56:56,824
You're releasing a Richard Suckle?

690
00:56:57,726 --> 00:57:00,524
- He called a cab.
- I'll have him brought right down.

691
00:57:06,868 --> 00:57:08,995
- Looking good today.
- Thanks.

692
00:57:13,375 --> 00:57:14,865
Rap sheet on Bobby Stiggers.

693
00:57:14,943 --> 00:57:16,035
Thank you.

694
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:30,185
Hobbesy, tell me something.

695
00:57:30,258 --> 00:57:31,247
Shoot.

696
00:57:31,326 --> 00:57:33,817
The other day you were
in the basement reading a file.

697
00:57:34,663 --> 00:57:35,721
What about it?

698
00:57:35,797 --> 00:57:38,664
Looked like a map in there.
You go somewhere?

699
00:57:39,701 --> 00:57:40,793
Up to the country.

700
00:57:40,869 --> 00:57:42,700
It's great to get out of town.

701
00:57:42,804 --> 00:57:44,431
Lovely. Fresh air, you know?

702
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:49,443
I used to do that. Go up to a house
in the mountains and sit by the water.

703
00:57:49,745 --> 00:57:51,042
It's beautiful.

704
00:57:52,881 --> 00:57:54,906
So I'm curious. Where'd you go?

705
00:57:56,585 --> 00:57:57,813
Why you ask?

706
00:58:00,822 --> 00:58:01,880
Come here.

707
00:58:02,724 --> 00:58:03,782
Come here.

708
00:58:04,426 --> 00:58:05,859
Come on, come here.

709
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:10,459
"Time

710
00:58:11,833 --> 00:58:13,596
"Is on my side

711
00:58:14,736 --> 00:58:15,828
"Yes, it is

712
00:58:16,371 --> 00:58:18,236
"Time

713
00:58:19,207 --> 00:58:21,004
"Is on my side

714
00:58:21,676 --> 00:58:22,802
"Yes, it is"

715
00:58:23,145 --> 00:58:24,737
- Lou?
- What?

716
00:58:27,115 --> 00:58:28,480
"You're always saying

717
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:30,550
"That you want to be free

718
00:58:30,786 --> 00:58:33,118
"But I'll come running back"

719
00:58:52,941 --> 00:58:54,670
Why'd you sing that song?

720
00:58:55,177 --> 00:58:57,475
- Song?
- Why were you singing that song?

721
00:58:57,546 --> 00:58:58,376
I sang?

722
00:58:58,447 --> 00:59:01,348
They put you up to this?
Why did you sing that song?

723
00:59:01,416 --> 00:59:02,246
What're you talking about?

724
00:59:02,317 --> 00:59:04,911
- You don't know what I'm talking about?
- No, I don't.

725
00:59:25,073 --> 00:59:26,233
Hey, you!

726
00:59:37,786 --> 00:59:39,515
Syrian Aramaic.

727
00:59:40,956 --> 00:59:42,287
How clever.

728
00:59:42,958 --> 00:59:43,925
Jesus.

729
00:59:46,394 --> 00:59:47,952
It's true what I said.

730
00:59:48,497 --> 00:59:50,089
I do know who you are.

731
00:59:51,166 --> 00:59:52,326
Azazel.

732
00:59:52,901 --> 00:59:54,391
Where'd you get that?

733
00:59:55,036 --> 00:59:56,503
From Milano's place?

734
00:59:57,038 --> 00:59:58,903
You found something up there.

735
00:59:59,808 --> 01:00:03,005
Well, some things, pal,
you shouldn't know.

736
01:00:03,411 --> 01:00:04,639
Like what?

737
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:06,638
Like what?

738
01:00:07,516 --> 01:00:10,679
If you know, you should never, ever tell.

739
01:00:21,096 --> 01:00:22,654
Beware my wrath.

740
01:01:39,674 --> 01:01:40,766
Well?

741
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:45,979
What were you doing back then?

742
01:01:47,482 --> 01:01:50,417
- What are you talking about?
- You were singing.

743
01:01:51,753 --> 01:01:52,811
No.

744
01:01:53,255 --> 01:01:54,745
- I wasn't singing.
- You were.

745
01:01:54,823 --> 01:01:57,656
Lawrence and Mike were singing
some '60s thing.

746
01:01:57,826 --> 01:01:59,020
There you go.

747
01:02:00,128 --> 01:02:03,097
I wasn't singing it.
I hated the fucking '60s.

748
01:02:07,102 --> 01:02:08,467
I wasn't singing.

749
01:02:11,339 --> 01:02:14,274
I appreciate your situation, okay?
I really do.

750
01:02:15,443 --> 01:02:18,879
Your father, mother, they're dead,
their lives ruined, your life ruined.

751
01:02:18,947 --> 01:02:20,574
I'm very sorry about that.

752
01:02:20,649 --> 01:02:24,710
But I gotta know what's going on.
If this thing is what it seems to be...

753
01:02:25,086 --> 01:02:28,078
...if this thing is
what the book says that it is, then...

754
01:02:34,896 --> 01:02:37,558
Is this for real? Do you believe this stuff?

755
01:02:37,666 --> 01:02:39,600
I believe more is hidden than is seen.

756
01:02:39,668 --> 01:02:43,798
I believe what I see. I'm trying to get
my mind around what I just saw.

757
01:02:44,272 --> 01:02:45,569
Something...

758
01:02:45,707 --> 01:02:47,038
...threatened me.

759
01:02:47,776 --> 01:02:49,744
Reese threatened me in Aramaic.

760
01:02:49,844 --> 01:02:51,744
What else did Reese say?

761
01:02:51,846 --> 01:02:53,814
I'm asking the questions here.

762
01:02:54,049 --> 01:02:58,952
You answer the questions I ask.
Because if I don't know what's going on...

763
01:02:59,054 --> 01:03:02,251
We're not supposed to know.
We're not supposed to see.

764
01:03:02,490 --> 01:03:05,118
It's like the Mafia. They don't even exist.

765
01:03:05,193 --> 01:03:06,524
Okay... okay.

766
01:03:06,928 --> 01:03:09,488
That's good. That's a start.
They don't even exist.

767
01:03:09,998 --> 01:03:12,660
So where are they from?
Who the hell are they?

768
01:03:13,368 --> 01:03:15,632
There are certain phenomena...

769
01:03:15,804 --> 01:03:19,103
...which can only be explained
if there is a god...

770
01:03:19,641 --> 01:03:22,667
...and if there are angels.
And there are. They exist.

771
01:03:23,244 --> 01:03:27,840
Some angels were cast down. A few
were punished by being deprived of form.

772
01:03:28,316 --> 01:03:31,615
They can only survive in the bodies
of others. It's inside of us.

773
01:03:31,686 --> 01:03:34,450
Inside of human beings,
their vengeance is played out.

774
01:03:38,059 --> 01:03:39,219
That's it?

775
01:03:40,328 --> 01:03:42,091
Come on, get out of here.

776
01:03:42,797 --> 01:03:44,321
Come on.

777
01:03:44,966 --> 01:03:46,126
I mean...

778
01:03:46,735 --> 01:03:48,862
Miss Milano, I'm just a cop, okay?

779
01:03:49,037 --> 01:03:50,299
I'm a detective.

780
01:03:50,372 --> 01:03:52,602
My work is based upon evidence, facts.

781
01:03:52,707 --> 01:03:54,470
Mine, too. Mine, too.

782
01:03:54,776 --> 01:03:59,008
Aren't your facts here
rather resistant to normal interpretation?

783
01:04:00,682 --> 01:04:02,343
So you're saying that...

784
01:04:02,884 --> 01:04:04,374
...Edgar Reese is actually...

785
01:04:04,519 --> 01:04:07,283
At the time you knew him,
he was not himself.

786
01:04:07,422 --> 01:04:09,287
- He was Azazel?
- Yes, Azazel.

787
01:04:09,657 --> 01:04:12,182
Sadistic, left-handed, likes to sing.

788
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:15,022
Reese? Why does he focus in on me?

789
01:04:15,196 --> 01:04:17,926
You got his attention.
He tried to get inside you.

790
01:04:17,999 --> 01:04:22,561
He shook your hand. That didn't work,
so now he'll try and find some other way.

791
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:26,801
Like he did with your father?

792
01:04:35,316 --> 01:04:37,580
How do we fight him? Is it possible?

793
01:04:37,719 --> 01:04:39,812
I believe it is. And I'm not alone.

794
01:04:40,355 --> 01:04:43,620
There's a network. I don't even know
who they are. I just have numbers.

795
01:04:43,725 --> 01:04:45,488
These people know the...

796
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:49,096
We believe that God limited demons
and made them mortal.

797
01:04:49,597 --> 01:04:51,531
He put a few of us here to fight them.

798
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:53,761
Us? Us who?

799
01:04:54,102 --> 01:04:55,296
Who, us?

800
01:04:55,703 --> 01:04:57,967
You saying I'm one of these people?

801
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:01,034
I don't know. Maybe. Maybe not.

802
01:05:01,543 --> 01:05:03,443
You're just doing your job.

803
01:05:04,379 --> 01:05:05,471
Okay.

804
01:05:05,814 --> 01:05:06,974
Touché.

805
01:05:07,649 --> 01:05:09,879
So these demons are mortal?
They can be killed?

806
01:05:09,951 --> 01:05:11,646
- By the right person.
- Who is?

807
01:05:11,719 --> 01:05:13,914
This is religion, Mr. Hobbes.

808
01:05:14,322 --> 01:05:17,758
These are matters of fate and divine order.
The right man...

809
01:05:17,826 --> 01:05:19,453
- Or woman.
- Yes.

810
01:05:19,661 --> 01:05:21,526
It could be you, me, anybody?

811
01:05:21,596 --> 01:05:25,157
The right person of the right character
with the right knowledge...

812
01:05:25,233 --> 01:05:27,326
So, this is what you've been doing.

813
01:05:27,402 --> 01:05:29,962
You've been preparing for this,
haven't you?

814
01:05:34,676 --> 01:05:36,109
Can I ask you something personal?

815
01:05:37,712 --> 01:05:39,805
Everything's personal if you're a person.

816
01:05:40,548 --> 01:05:42,345
Is this why you live alone?

817
01:05:44,686 --> 01:05:48,417
There's a difference between
risking for yourself and someone else.

818
01:05:48,690 --> 01:05:49,850
That's true.

819
01:05:50,291 --> 01:05:51,280
I mean...

820
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:56,160
...if I had someone, I'd want to share
my life and thoughts, and work with them.

821
01:05:56,698 --> 01:06:00,099
If I shared this, I'd put them at risk
and I don't have that right.

822
01:06:01,970 --> 01:06:03,403
You can talk to me.

823
01:06:03,738 --> 01:06:06,707
You don't have to. I'm not saying that.
I'm not, you know...

824
01:06:07,275 --> 01:06:10,972
Do whatever you want to do. I'm just
saying you can talk to me if you want.

825
01:06:12,647 --> 01:06:13,773
Thanks.

826
01:06:14,415 --> 01:06:16,679
That's a very nice thing to say.

827
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:19,077
I've got to go.

828
01:06:19,220 --> 01:06:21,188
I hope I've been helpful.

829
01:06:22,857 --> 01:06:24,688
- Thanks for listening.
- Thank you.

830
01:07:33,995 --> 01:07:35,087
I'm sorry.

831
01:07:35,229 --> 01:07:37,094
I was about to tap you on the shoulder.

832
01:07:37,532 --> 01:07:39,864
You're a friend of John Hobbes, right?

833
01:07:40,602 --> 01:07:41,933
I'm Jay Reynolds.

834
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:46,629
You know?

835
01:07:48,242 --> 01:07:49,436
How lovely.

836
01:07:51,779 --> 01:07:53,713
You're not just Hobbes' chippy.

837
01:07:54,482 --> 01:07:55,744
Have we met?

838
01:07:55,917 --> 01:07:57,612
You seem vaguely familiar.

839
01:07:59,253 --> 01:08:00,345
Come on...

840
01:08:00,488 --> 01:08:01,580
...tell me.

841
01:08:02,724 --> 01:08:04,624
I'm about to find out anyway.

842
01:08:10,798 --> 01:08:11,787
Foreplay.

843
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:13,089
Watch out.

844
01:08:13,167 --> 01:08:14,566
No, you don't!

845
01:08:39,994 --> 01:08:41,325
Please, help me!

846
01:08:43,498 --> 01:08:45,022
Go! Go!

847
01:08:45,199 --> 01:08:47,190
- Open up!
- Go!

848
01:08:56,344 --> 01:08:58,039
Jesus, are you all right?

849
01:09:20,902 --> 01:09:22,164
You all right?

850
01:09:28,409 --> 01:09:29,842
Thanks for coming.

851
01:09:35,616 --> 01:09:36,844
I ran.

852
01:09:38,619 --> 01:09:40,416
He came after me and I ran.

853
01:09:43,624 --> 01:09:44,852
Maybe you weren't ready yet.

854
01:09:44,926 --> 01:09:47,588
That's the point. You have to be ready.

855
01:09:48,496 --> 01:09:49,986
You know what it is?

856
01:09:51,733 --> 01:09:53,997
I never believed this day would come.

857
01:09:54,702 --> 01:09:57,432
I thought God would make it up to me.
I'd be good...

858
01:09:57,505 --> 01:10:00,030
...and God would show me
an angel instead.

859
01:10:02,844 --> 01:10:04,334
Do they know who you are?

860
01:10:10,418 --> 01:10:12,181
We shouldn't be seen together.

861
01:10:13,087 --> 01:10:14,247
Not anymore.

862
01:10:20,862 --> 01:10:22,454
Wipe your tear.

863
01:10:36,310 --> 01:10:38,073
Wanted to see me, Lieutenant?

864
01:10:38,479 --> 01:10:39,776
How you doing?

865
01:10:40,381 --> 01:10:41,370
Fine.

866
01:10:41,482 --> 01:10:43,609
Murders not getting you wound up?

867
01:10:45,052 --> 01:10:48,954
Bag the chocolates. You ain't got
to talk to me sideways. What's up?

868
01:10:50,491 --> 01:10:53,085
Where were you
when Muskavich and Noons were killed?

869
01:10:54,562 --> 01:10:55,859
Where was I?

870
01:10:56,330 --> 01:10:57,820
Am I a suspect?

871
01:10:58,866 --> 01:11:00,060
Sit down.

872
01:11:04,105 --> 01:11:05,595
Not to me, you're not.

873
01:11:05,673 --> 01:11:06,662
But...

874
01:11:07,241 --> 01:11:11,143
Lieutenant, you know...
What is it, the phone records again?

875
01:11:12,113 --> 01:11:13,603
What do they think?

876
01:11:13,714 --> 01:11:17,411
I committed murder, then called home,
then ran home and answered my phone?

877
01:11:17,485 --> 01:11:19,146
No, it's something else.

878
01:11:19,954 --> 01:11:21,285
Your prints.

879
01:11:22,156 --> 01:11:23,248
My prints?

880
01:11:23,925 --> 01:11:24,949
On what?

881
01:11:25,226 --> 01:11:27,592
On that fucking little coin of yours.

882
01:11:28,296 --> 01:11:30,161
- Where?
- Noons' place.

883
01:11:40,508 --> 01:11:41,770
Shit.

884
01:11:43,778 --> 01:11:45,211
This is a frame-up.

885
01:11:45,613 --> 01:11:46,409
Is it?

886
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:48,243
Anybody could have got those coins.

887
01:11:48,349 --> 01:11:51,375
They could have got them
when I'm at the store or something.

888
01:11:51,452 --> 01:11:53,443
They could've taken them off my desk.

889
01:11:53,554 --> 01:11:55,613
We always said it could be a cop.

890
01:11:57,592 --> 01:11:59,184
We did always say that.

891
01:11:59,827 --> 01:12:01,624
I'm not stupid, you know.

892
01:12:02,296 --> 01:12:04,526
I know you know more than you're saying.

893
01:12:05,066 --> 01:12:06,226
So tell me.

894
01:12:09,570 --> 01:12:11,197
You don't really want to know.

895
01:12:11,606 --> 01:12:14,939
You'd have to be there.
I was there and I don't even want to know.

896
01:12:15,009 --> 01:12:16,203
Try me.

897
01:12:22,350 --> 01:12:23,977
Remember Robert Milano?

898
01:12:24,485 --> 01:12:25,679
Listen to me.

899
01:12:25,786 --> 01:12:28,380
This is exactly what happened to him.

900
01:12:30,358 --> 01:12:31,689
He was framed.

901
01:12:35,396 --> 01:12:37,159
I'll give you some advice.

902
01:12:38,499 --> 01:12:40,660
Let go of it for a couple of hours.

903
01:12:40,968 --> 01:12:42,230
Go home.

904
01:12:42,803 --> 01:12:44,202
See your family.

905
01:12:44,705 --> 01:12:46,195
Take a load off.

906
01:12:54,048 --> 01:12:55,606
The hell with Stanton.

907
01:12:56,250 --> 01:12:57,945
The hell with all of them.

908
01:12:58,386 --> 01:13:00,911
Nobody likes to get
the shit kicked out of them.

909
01:13:01,289 --> 01:13:03,757
Nobody likes to get hit from every angle.

910
01:13:03,824 --> 01:13:07,089
But evil just keeps on coming.
You know what I mean?

911
01:13:07,595 --> 01:13:09,756
You saw it before, but now...

912
01:13:10,364 --> 01:13:13,595
...it's in your face, laughing at you.

913
01:13:16,637 --> 01:13:18,468
- Hi, Unc.
- Hey, Sam.

914
01:13:20,074 --> 01:13:21,234
How you doing?

915
01:13:21,309 --> 01:13:22,571
Hi, Mr. Hobbes.

916
01:13:24,512 --> 01:13:26,173
You're home early today.

917
01:13:27,081 --> 01:13:28,412
For a change.

918
01:13:57,078 --> 01:13:59,137
- Did you move my address book?
- What?

919
01:13:59,213 --> 01:14:00,237
No.

920
01:14:01,349 --> 01:14:02,509
What?

921
01:14:08,990 --> 01:14:10,582
What's wrong with your eye?

922
01:14:15,596 --> 01:14:17,029
Who hit you in the eye?

923
01:14:18,165 --> 01:14:19,189
I fell.

924
01:14:19,767 --> 01:14:20,859
You fell?

925
01:14:22,236 --> 01:14:23,999
I fell, or something.

926
01:14:25,239 --> 01:14:27,366
People don't fall down and get a black eye.

927
01:14:27,441 --> 01:14:28,931
- No?
- No.

928
01:14:31,479 --> 01:14:33,140
All right, it's okay.

929
01:14:33,247 --> 01:14:34,339
It's okay.

930
01:14:35,916 --> 01:14:37,213
What happened?

931
01:14:38,753 --> 01:14:40,050
Sammy hit me.

932
01:14:40,287 --> 01:14:41,276
What?

933
01:14:41,355 --> 01:14:44,222
It was an accident though.
He didn't mean to.

934
01:14:44,859 --> 01:14:46,588
He didn't mean to.

935
01:14:48,462 --> 01:14:50,453
It was an accident. It was an accident!

936
01:14:50,531 --> 01:14:52,123
John... John!

937
01:14:52,366 --> 01:14:53,424
Sam?

938
01:14:54,902 --> 01:14:56,460
Where's Toby?

939
01:14:56,937 --> 01:14:58,632
Outside, I guess.

940
01:14:59,607 --> 01:15:01,336
Okay, go back in the house.

941
01:15:08,783 --> 01:15:10,546
- Toby?
- Hey, Hobbes.

942
01:15:16,891 --> 01:15:18,756
Leave my family alone, you hear me?

943
01:15:19,693 --> 01:15:20,785
Go back in the house.

944
01:15:20,861 --> 01:15:23,227
- What's going on?
- Go back in the house!

945
01:15:28,803 --> 01:15:30,930
- You leave my family alone.
- Why?

946
01:15:31,372 --> 01:15:34,808
You come after me.
Now I come after you and yours.

947
01:15:59,867 --> 01:16:01,528
Toby, you all right?

948
01:16:02,203 --> 01:16:03,602
Go right home. Go.

949
01:16:03,671 --> 01:16:05,104
- I will.
- Run.

950
01:16:28,195 --> 01:16:30,288
What's the matter, pal?
Afraid to fight me?

951
01:16:32,333 --> 01:16:33,857
Come on, Hobbes. Come on out.

952
01:16:35,870 --> 01:16:37,098
Come on, Hobbes.

953
01:16:38,572 --> 01:16:39,732
Put the gun down.

954
01:16:41,842 --> 01:16:43,139
I knew you'd come out.

955
01:16:43,210 --> 01:16:44,802
Put the gun on the ground!

956
01:16:45,212 --> 01:16:46,645
I know you, Hobbes.

957
01:16:46,780 --> 01:16:48,372
Set the gun down, sir!

958
01:16:53,687 --> 01:16:55,348
Put the gun down!

959
01:18:04,658 --> 01:18:05,818
"Yes, it is

960
01:18:06,961 --> 01:18:08,485
"Time

961
01:18:09,763 --> 01:18:11,890
"Is on my side"

962
01:18:12,366 --> 01:18:13,560
Hey, pal.

963
01:18:15,002 --> 01:18:16,333
Wake up, Hobbes.

964
01:18:16,537 --> 01:18:18,266
I'm not that easy to kill.

965
01:18:18,539 --> 01:18:22,771
When my host dies and I move as spirit,
no man can resist me.

966
01:18:24,245 --> 01:18:27,408
What are you going to do, arrest me?
What'll you tell Stanton?

967
01:18:27,481 --> 01:18:29,346
I'd love to hear that one.

968
01:18:29,717 --> 01:18:31,184
It's me you want, isn't it?

969
01:18:32,052 --> 01:18:33,815
Why don't you just kill me?

970
01:18:34,221 --> 01:18:35,916
But I'm still having fun.

971
01:18:36,857 --> 01:18:38,722
Aren't you still having fun?

972
01:19:29,843 --> 01:19:32,175
He was standing in the street,
yelling at him.

973
01:19:32,246 --> 01:19:34,840
Shooting at him.
Finally, when the officer...

974
01:19:36,150 --> 01:19:37,549
I guess that's it.

975
01:19:45,159 --> 01:19:47,753
There's no question
that the dead man shot first.

976
01:19:47,828 --> 01:19:51,423
No question at all.
My wife saw it too, if you want to ask her.

977
01:19:53,534 --> 01:19:54,933
A schoolteacher.

978
01:19:57,705 --> 01:19:59,263
What am I going to say?

979
01:19:59,340 --> 01:20:00,898
What am I going to do?

980
01:20:01,375 --> 01:20:05,106
We know that he fired first.
Witnesses corroborate.

981
01:20:05,279 --> 01:20:09,306
But his gun was filled with blanks.
He got the gun out of a stolen car.

982
01:20:09,416 --> 01:20:11,043
- It was a setup.
- A setup?

983
01:20:11,118 --> 01:20:12,449
That's right. A setup.

984
01:20:12,786 --> 01:20:14,686
He sets it up for you to kill him?

985
01:20:14,755 --> 01:20:15,983
Committing suicide by...

986
01:20:16,056 --> 01:20:17,114
Excuse me.

987
01:20:19,593 --> 01:20:21,527
What the hell are you doing out here?

988
01:20:21,862 --> 01:20:24,797
You take Sam home,
lock every door, every window...

989
01:20:24,965 --> 01:20:27,559
You don't let anybody in. Can you do that?

990
01:20:28,035 --> 01:20:30,367
Can you remember that? All right, do it.

991
01:20:30,437 --> 01:20:31,927
- Johnny?
- Yeah.

992
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:34,407
Are you mad at me or something?

993
01:20:35,642 --> 01:20:37,371
No, Art. Never. Just...

994
01:20:38,846 --> 01:20:40,279
Do what I told you.

995
01:20:44,952 --> 01:20:47,477
Hate to see the mighty fall,
you know what I mean?

996
01:20:48,288 --> 01:20:50,756
Now it's letters. Fuck you, Lou.

997
01:20:51,892 --> 01:20:53,689
I told you, it's a cult.

998
01:20:54,027 --> 01:20:57,929
Some weird, psycho,
Aramaic-Satanist reincarnation cult.

999
01:20:58,465 --> 01:21:00,365
He's got A-P-O written on his chest.

1000
01:21:01,435 --> 01:21:03,494
It's trying to send some kind of message.

1001
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:08,499
The killer's sending a message?

1002
01:21:09,977 --> 01:21:11,410
Hobbes...

1003
01:21:12,780 --> 01:21:14,748
This time, you are the killer.

1004
01:21:16,383 --> 01:21:17,372
Yeah, sort of.

1005
01:21:17,451 --> 01:21:18,918
No fucking sort of.

1006
01:21:19,253 --> 01:21:21,517
No breaks. No benefit of the doubt.

1007
01:21:22,022 --> 01:21:24,855
We're going back to the precinct. Now.

1008
01:21:36,503 --> 01:21:38,994
Tonight, another shocking murder
in the city.

1009
01:21:39,173 --> 01:21:43,667
A well-respected schoolteacher
opened fire on an off-duty police officer.

1010
01:21:43,877 --> 01:21:45,037
The officer...

1011
01:21:45,279 --> 01:21:48,271
...John Hobbes, was forced to return fire.

1012
01:21:48,749 --> 01:21:50,376
Our report now, from the scene.

1013
01:21:51,185 --> 01:21:54,677
We're on the scene
of a most unusual homicide tonight.

1014
01:21:55,155 --> 01:21:56,452
Close the door.

1015
01:21:56,623 --> 01:21:59,820
Detective Hobbes shot and killed
a high-school math teacher.

1016
01:21:59,893 --> 01:22:02,157
The police have not yet identified him.

1017
01:22:02,229 --> 01:22:05,323
According to witnesses,
the man started shooting at Hobbes...

1018
01:22:05,399 --> 01:22:07,390
...who was off duty at the time.

1019
01:22:09,269 --> 01:22:11,567
Talked to the schoolteacher's wife.

1020
01:22:12,372 --> 01:22:13,896
He got married four months ago.

1021
01:22:13,974 --> 01:22:16,135
She's pregnant. He just got a raise.

1022
01:22:16,910 --> 01:22:19,105
So much for suicide by cop!

1023
01:22:24,985 --> 01:22:26,816
The shooting team needs your gun.

1024
01:22:27,921 --> 01:22:30,253
I'll get the hearing as soon as I can.

1025
01:22:31,592 --> 01:22:33,492
People want the world to make sense.

1026
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:38,088
If the only way I can get the world
to make sense for me is to arrest you...

1027
01:22:38,765 --> 01:22:40,255
...then I'll have to do it.

1028
01:22:44,571 --> 01:22:45,765
Get the fuck out of here.

1029
01:23:29,550 --> 01:23:31,575
- It was a clean shoot.
- Yeah, I know.

1030
01:23:31,852 --> 01:23:33,581
It doesn't help, but I know.

1031
01:23:35,322 --> 01:23:36,414
Coffee?

1032
01:23:36,723 --> 01:23:37,951
No, thanks.

1033
01:23:38,525 --> 01:23:42,894
Want to talk? From where I sit, we're
dealing with shit that ain't in the manual.

1034
01:23:46,300 --> 01:23:49,531
Where do they buy coffee with dirt in it?
Tell me that.

1035
01:23:54,341 --> 01:23:56,275
What's the point of life?

1036
01:23:57,611 --> 01:23:59,169
- The point?
- Yeah.

1037
01:24:01,882 --> 01:24:03,474
- Of life.
- Yeah.

1038
01:24:06,753 --> 01:24:08,277
The point... You want a cigarette?

1039
01:24:08,355 --> 01:24:09,515
No, thanks.

1040
01:24:13,193 --> 01:24:15,218
The point of life is we catch bad guys.

1041
01:24:15,862 --> 01:24:17,762
That's what I used to think.

1042
01:24:19,766 --> 01:24:21,256
It's not good enough.

1043
01:24:21,468 --> 01:24:23,493
You'll shoot me for talking like this but...

1044
01:24:25,038 --> 01:24:27,598
It's two o'clock in the morning.
You can talk any way you want.

1045
01:24:30,544 --> 01:24:32,842
What are we doing here,
you know what I'm saying?

1046
01:24:33,447 --> 01:24:34,812
Why do we even exist?

1047
01:24:34,881 --> 01:24:35,870
Us.

1048
01:24:37,985 --> 01:24:39,714
Maybe it's God, Hobbes.

1049
01:24:40,787 --> 01:24:42,152
Yeah, it could be.

1050
01:24:45,192 --> 01:24:47,717
I have a hard time believing that we're...

1051
01:24:48,528 --> 01:24:50,462
...part of some huge...

1052
01:24:51,298 --> 01:24:55,166
...moral experiment, you know,
conducted by a greater being than us.

1053
01:24:55,535 --> 01:24:59,335
If there's a greater being than we are,
why does he give a shit about us?

1054
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:03,207
There's five billion of us.
We're like ants. Do we care...

1055
01:25:03,543 --> 01:25:05,841
...what ants do from a moral standpoint?

1056
01:25:06,013 --> 01:25:07,071
Ants?

1057
01:25:08,148 --> 01:25:11,640
I'm following you,
but at the same time I'm losing you.

1058
01:25:12,119 --> 01:25:13,984
Are you heading someplace here?

1059
01:25:14,054 --> 01:25:15,646
That's my point.

1060
01:25:16,156 --> 01:25:17,817
Are we headed someplace?

1061
01:25:18,558 --> 01:25:20,321
If we don't figure it out...

1062
01:25:22,929 --> 01:25:24,829
Maybe if you figure it out...

1063
01:25:26,566 --> 01:25:27,658
...you die.

1064
01:25:27,801 --> 01:25:30,736
Heart attack, stroke.
You figure out what's what...

1065
01:25:31,605 --> 01:25:34,802
...you don't get to hang around anymore.
You get promoted.

1066
01:25:36,910 --> 01:25:38,571
Meanwhile, Delores...

1067
01:25:39,980 --> 01:25:42,039
...says we're put here to do one thing.

1068
01:25:42,182 --> 01:25:43,308
One thing?

1069
01:25:44,251 --> 01:25:45,309
What's that?

1070
01:25:45,385 --> 01:25:49,082
It's different. It's different for everybody.
Hers is lasagna.

1071
01:25:49,489 --> 01:25:50,683
Lasagna?

1072
01:25:52,159 --> 01:25:53,956
And just one thing, not two or...?

1073
01:25:54,127 --> 01:25:56,857
Maybe two, I don't know.
It's just her opinion.

1074
01:25:57,698 --> 01:25:59,029
But it's like...

1075
01:26:00,701 --> 01:26:02,464
...when a moment comes...

1076
01:26:03,937 --> 01:26:05,928
...we either do the right thing...

1077
01:26:06,873 --> 01:26:07,771
...or wrong.

1078
01:26:09,843 --> 01:26:11,606
When do you know
when your moment comes?

1079
01:26:22,923 --> 01:26:24,481
So, like this could be it for me?

1080
01:26:24,558 --> 01:26:26,458
That's the beauty. You never know.

1081
01:26:29,696 --> 01:26:30,890
- Hello?
- John?

1082
01:26:31,164 --> 01:26:32,495
Is that you?

1083
01:26:34,501 --> 01:26:37,334
Hi. I just wanted to see if you were okay.

1084
01:26:38,438 --> 01:26:40,929
I'll call you back. I'll call you later.

1085
01:26:48,582 --> 01:26:51,210
That was the killer.
We'll arrange things later.

1086
01:27:03,330 --> 01:27:04,592
I'm going home.

1087
01:27:06,266 --> 01:27:07,756
Yeah, fuck it.

1088
01:27:21,982 --> 01:27:23,415
I killed someone.

1089
01:27:23,750 --> 01:27:25,843
He got me to kill an innocent man.

1090
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:27,982
I know.

1091
01:27:28,321 --> 01:27:30,050
What do they want, Gretta?

1092
01:27:30,791 --> 01:27:32,622
Just tell me what they want.

1093
01:27:32,692 --> 01:27:34,091
The demons?

1094
01:27:34,561 --> 01:27:36,552
They want the fall of civilization.

1095
01:27:36,630 --> 01:27:39,121
The fall of Babylon, as they put it.

1096
01:27:39,633 --> 01:27:41,362
- The whole thing?
- Yeah.

1097
01:27:42,636 --> 01:27:45,002
They're doing a good job, aren't they?

1098
01:27:45,372 --> 01:27:47,738
You know, after I shot the teacher...

1099
01:27:48,475 --> 01:27:50,238
...Azazel moved to someone else.

1100
01:27:50,310 --> 01:27:52,710
Are you sure? After death?

1101
01:27:53,046 --> 01:27:55,640
I'm positive. After death. Yeah, I saw it.

1102
01:27:55,816 --> 01:27:56,942
Listen to this.

1103
01:27:57,017 --> 01:27:59,884
I was looking through
one of your father's books...

1104
01:28:00,387 --> 01:28:04,824
...and it says "outside"...
I guess that means outside the body.

1105
01:28:06,026 --> 01:28:09,325
Outside, they can survive
for one breath only.

1106
01:28:10,063 --> 01:28:13,726
A Hebrew text says the breath
can carry them for 500 cubits.

1107
01:28:14,067 --> 01:28:15,728
I never knew what it meant.

1108
01:28:15,802 --> 01:28:18,430
A cubit, that's a distance
or something, right?

1109
01:28:18,505 --> 01:28:20,530
From your elbow to your fingertip.

1110
01:28:20,607 --> 01:28:24,600
So 500 cubits would be what?
About a sixth of a mile?

1111
01:28:24,811 --> 01:28:26,904
Yeah, well, you're right then.

1112
01:28:28,248 --> 01:28:30,341
They are limited in certain ways.

1113
01:28:32,752 --> 01:28:34,310
What are you thinking?

1114
01:28:35,355 --> 01:28:36,583
I don't know.

1115
01:28:39,326 --> 01:28:41,419
I don't know. You okay?

1116
01:28:42,562 --> 01:28:43,586
Yeah.

1117
01:28:44,197 --> 01:28:45,562
All right. Well, then...

1118
01:28:46,533 --> 01:28:48,330
...maybe I'll check on you tomorrow.

1119
01:28:51,338 --> 01:28:52,498
Good night.

1120
01:28:52,572 --> 01:28:53,664
Good night.

1121
01:29:17,530 --> 01:29:18,724
Good morning, Sam.

1122
01:29:20,300 --> 01:29:21,528
Good morning, Sam.

1123
01:29:21,601 --> 01:29:23,034
Oh, hi, Uncle John.

1124
01:29:23,103 --> 01:29:24,161
Oh, hi.

1125
01:29:24,437 --> 01:29:27,463
- Thanks for tucking me in last night.
- You're welcome.

1126
01:29:30,076 --> 01:29:32,306
We sent Michael Aaron to the scene...

1127
01:29:32,479 --> 01:29:36,677
...where he'll be ready with a live report
shortly. We'll be right back.

1128
01:30:29,469 --> 01:30:31,369
Were you asleep when I tucked you in?

1129
01:30:32,138 --> 01:30:35,904
I don't know.
All I remember was somebody tickling me.

1130
01:30:36,142 --> 01:30:37,507
Tickling my chest.

1131
01:30:43,683 --> 01:30:45,207
Why'd you write that?

1132
01:30:47,887 --> 01:30:49,878
- Where's your father?
- In the bedroom.

1133
01:30:49,956 --> 01:30:51,321
He's a sleepyhead.

1134
01:30:56,763 --> 01:30:59,823
If you've watched the national news
just last week...

1135
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,434
...you might have seen
a similar case in Boston...

1136
01:31:02,502 --> 01:31:05,164
...of a decorated cop accused of murder.

1137
01:33:22,242 --> 01:33:23,072
Hello?

1138
01:33:23,543 --> 01:33:24,874
You see the news?

1139
01:33:25,378 --> 01:33:28,643
The cop was shooting first.
And he kept on shooting.

1140
01:33:30,049 --> 01:33:31,607
Lou's coming to get you.

1141
01:33:31,684 --> 01:33:33,845
He's bringing you down
for more conversation.

1142
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:35,217
- Lou?
- No.

1143
01:33:35,555 --> 01:33:37,853
- They get him yet?
- No. Not yet.

1144
01:33:39,792 --> 01:33:41,316
I gotta go.

1145
01:34:18,998 --> 01:34:21,728
Here. Put these clothes on.
Get dressed right away.

1146
01:34:21,801 --> 01:34:23,860
- Why?
- Just do as I tell you, please.

1147
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:34,938
You ready?

1148
01:34:35,048 --> 01:34:37,380
Almost. What's going on here?

1149
01:34:37,550 --> 01:34:40,986
We're just going to play
a little trick on somebody.

1150
01:34:41,387 --> 01:34:42,376
Cool.

1151
01:34:47,460 --> 01:34:49,291
We're going out the window.

1152
01:34:52,565 --> 01:34:53,964
What about my dad?

1153
01:34:55,868 --> 01:34:58,496
He's sleeping. He's still sleeping.

1154
01:35:46,085 --> 01:35:48,849
- Excuse me, Sister. How you doing?
- Good.

1155
01:35:49,255 --> 01:35:50,244
Good.

1156
01:35:51,591 --> 01:35:54,185
Does "apocalypse" mean anything to you?

1157
01:35:54,927 --> 01:35:56,121
Sure it does.

1158
01:35:56,296 --> 01:35:59,197
Apocalypse was
the Greek word for revelation.

1159
01:35:59,732 --> 01:36:01,063
Revelation?

1160
01:36:02,101 --> 01:36:03,864
You mean like the book of the Bible?

1161
01:36:04,637 --> 01:36:05,729
Revelation.

1162
01:36:05,905 --> 01:36:07,304
All right. Thank you.

1163
01:36:38,037 --> 01:36:39,504
Pack of cigarettes.

1164
01:36:39,939 --> 01:36:41,600
- Any special kind?
- No, any kind.

1165
01:36:42,675 --> 01:36:44,472
Okay, out of five.

1166
01:36:47,447 --> 01:36:48,778
Detective Hobbes?

1167
01:36:49,582 --> 01:36:51,174
Sir, you forgot your change.

1168
01:36:51,250 --> 01:36:52,774
Detective Hobbes.

1169
01:36:53,186 --> 01:36:54,744
I want to talk to you.

1170
01:36:58,725 --> 01:37:02,024
Go, Sam. Run! Down the stairs,
down the stairs! Go!

1171
01:37:02,462 --> 01:37:03,929
All units in the area...

1172
01:37:43,503 --> 01:37:45,403
Why don't you close that coat up?

1173
01:37:57,917 --> 01:37:59,009
Cigarettes?

1174
01:37:59,519 --> 01:38:02,249
I thought you quit.
I thought they were bad for you.

1175
01:38:02,355 --> 01:38:04,414
I did quit and they are bad for you.

1176
01:38:08,060 --> 01:38:09,755
You know what's going on?

1177
01:38:14,834 --> 01:38:18,326
The police think
that I did some bad things.

1178
01:38:19,906 --> 01:38:22,033
- You are the police.
- Not anymore.

1179
01:38:23,509 --> 01:38:25,067
Why do they think you did that?

1180
01:38:25,144 --> 01:38:26,270
Because...

1181
01:38:27,680 --> 01:38:29,614
Because somebody...

1182
01:38:30,583 --> 01:38:32,050
...made it look like I did.

1183
01:38:32,985 --> 01:38:34,850
I once saw that on a show.

1184
01:38:44,797 --> 01:38:46,765
I want to talk to you about something.

1185
01:38:48,401 --> 01:38:49,663
About your dad.

1186
01:38:53,873 --> 01:38:55,500
He's not asleep, is he?

1187
01:38:59,445 --> 01:39:01,174
No, son. He's not asleep.

1188
01:39:03,449 --> 01:39:04,746
Did it hurt?

1189
01:39:08,354 --> 01:39:09,685
I don't think so.

1190
01:39:11,557 --> 01:39:14,048
- Do you think he's gonna go to heaven?
- Yes.

1191
01:39:14,827 --> 01:39:15,987
Yes, I do.

1192
01:39:16,562 --> 01:39:18,928
Anybody deserves to go to heaven,
it's your dad.

1193
01:39:22,502 --> 01:39:23,992
I think so, too.

1194
01:39:55,334 --> 01:39:57,131
We got no place else to go.

1195
01:39:57,370 --> 01:39:59,031
This is my nephew, Sam.

1196
01:40:00,973 --> 01:40:02,838
Okay. Hi, Sam.

1197
01:40:03,009 --> 01:40:04,840
Nice to meet you. I'm Gretta.

1198
01:40:07,880 --> 01:40:09,541
You're in your pajamas.

1199
01:40:09,982 --> 01:40:13,042
I wasn't expecting company,
but I'm glad you're here.

1200
01:40:16,122 --> 01:40:20,149
Why don't you go over there
by the fireplace and get warm.

1201
01:40:21,127 --> 01:40:22,822
Azazel wrote on his chest.

1202
01:40:22,962 --> 01:40:24,156
Unless I do something...

1203
01:40:26,933 --> 01:40:28,560
I'll get you a coffee.

1204
01:40:28,634 --> 01:40:29,692
Thank you.

1205
01:41:32,965 --> 01:41:35,695
I think I got my mind
around this thing now, but let me...

1206
01:41:35,901 --> 01:41:37,892
...let me run this by you, okay?

1207
01:41:38,938 --> 01:41:40,963
After the host body dies...

1208
01:41:41,841 --> 01:41:45,299
...the demon can survive
for one breath or 500 cubits, right?

1209
01:41:45,478 --> 01:41:46,809
At the same time...

1210
01:41:46,879 --> 01:41:50,713
...Azazel says to me
when he moves as spirit no man can resist.

1211
01:41:50,783 --> 01:41:54,412
So someone he can't get into by touch,
he can still get into by spirit.

1212
01:41:54,487 --> 01:41:58,389
Because if, when he's in spirit form...

1213
01:41:58,958 --> 01:42:03,156
...he's fighting for his life,
he's going to be that much more powerful.

1214
01:42:06,832 --> 01:42:08,993
Please tell me what you're going to do.

1215
01:42:09,335 --> 01:42:10,825
Whatever I do...

1216
01:42:11,237 --> 01:42:15,503
...I have to make sure
that you and Sam are safe.

1217
01:42:16,742 --> 01:42:18,437
Will you take him somewhere...

1218
01:42:18,511 --> 01:42:20,172
...nobody knows about?

1219
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:22,240
Even me.

1220
01:42:37,596 --> 01:42:38,858
Listen...

1221
01:42:41,701 --> 01:42:42,793
I gotta go.

1222
01:42:44,203 --> 01:42:46,694
You're gonna stay with Gretta for a while.

1223
01:42:47,039 --> 01:42:48,768
Maybe for a long while.

1224
01:42:50,543 --> 01:42:52,534
And I want you to remember this:

1225
01:42:52,611 --> 01:42:54,875
Whatever people say about me...

1226
01:42:56,549 --> 01:42:58,278
...or whatever I do...

1227
01:42:59,719 --> 01:43:02,984
...I just want you to remember
that I'm doing it for you.

1228
01:43:03,889 --> 01:43:05,516
Because I love you.

1229
01:43:06,559 --> 01:43:07,890
You understand?

1230
01:43:12,398 --> 01:43:14,298
I'm gonna go back to sleep...

1231
01:43:15,234 --> 01:43:19,534
...and when I wake up
everything is gonna be just the way it was.

1232
01:43:56,041 --> 01:43:57,099
Thank you.

1233
01:43:59,678 --> 01:44:01,236
You know what this means, right?

1234
01:44:03,349 --> 01:44:04,611
I'm ready.

1235
01:44:44,023 --> 01:44:45,615
Hey, Jonesy, how you doing?

1236
01:44:45,691 --> 01:44:46,749
Look, I'm worried, man.

1237
01:44:47,960 --> 01:44:49,723
What are you gonna do?

1238
01:44:50,162 --> 01:44:51,993
I'm going nowhere.

1239
01:44:52,731 --> 01:44:54,722
I'm taking a long drive...

1240
01:44:55,734 --> 01:44:57,167
...where nobody will find me...

1241
01:44:57,870 --> 01:45:00,498
...and sit by the water and think.

1242
01:45:01,073 --> 01:45:02,904
I gotta ask you something.

1243
01:45:03,275 --> 01:45:04,640
Yeah, shoot.

1244
01:45:05,110 --> 01:45:07,101
We've been partners a long time.

1245
01:45:07,346 --> 01:45:10,110
Twelve plus, Jonesy. Twelve plus.

1246
01:45:10,749 --> 01:45:13,843
So is there anything you gotta tell me?

1247
01:45:15,087 --> 01:45:18,352
Yeah, remember what we were
talking about the other night?

1248
01:45:19,258 --> 01:45:21,089
When the moment comes...

1249
01:45:21,560 --> 01:45:22,925
...you know it.

1250
01:45:24,864 --> 01:45:26,263
Be careful, okay?

1251
01:45:27,032 --> 01:45:28,590
I'll see you, partner.

1252
01:45:28,934 --> 01:45:30,196
Yeah, you, too.

1253
01:45:31,103 --> 01:45:32,297
Be good.

1254
01:46:02,835 --> 01:46:05,395
You're probably wondering:
What am I doing?

1255
01:46:06,839 --> 01:46:09,307
This is where things get a little tricky.

1256
01:46:09,742 --> 01:46:11,733
It's just him and me now.

1257
01:46:12,311 --> 01:46:14,404
Hobbes versus Azazel.

1258
01:46:16,815 --> 01:46:18,305
I thought I had him.

1259
01:46:18,751 --> 01:46:20,651
But he thought he had me, too.

1260
01:48:16,068 --> 01:48:17,365
Come on out.

1261
01:48:17,970 --> 01:48:19,767
I know you're here.

1262
01:48:21,106 --> 01:48:22,698
I knew you'd come.

1263
01:48:33,952 --> 01:48:35,852
Haven't you done enough?

1264
01:48:39,324 --> 01:48:41,554
You made me kill an innocent man. You...

1265
01:48:45,097 --> 01:48:46,894
...murdered my brother!

1266
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,195
Come out, you son of a bitch!

1267
01:48:51,070 --> 01:48:53,334
How much more fun can you have!

1268
01:48:57,876 --> 01:48:59,741
Jesus, Hobbes.

1269
01:49:01,346 --> 01:49:03,906
What are you talking about?

1270
01:49:06,151 --> 01:49:08,016
I didn't do any of that.

1271
01:49:09,555 --> 01:49:13,651
Me, I'm the poor schmo
they sent up here to bring you in.

1272
01:49:15,894 --> 01:49:17,521
So it's you now.

1273
01:49:17,863 --> 01:49:19,057
It's me.

1274
01:49:19,198 --> 01:49:21,098
Who'd you expect it'd be?

1275
01:49:22,301 --> 01:49:24,235
Now drop your gun, Hobbes.

1276
01:49:25,003 --> 01:49:26,834
I know you got one.

1277
01:49:27,439 --> 01:49:28,701
Or what?

1278
01:49:29,241 --> 01:49:30,572
You'll shoot me?

1279
01:49:32,111 --> 01:49:33,806
Where is the fun in that?

1280
01:49:34,346 --> 01:49:35,677
Fuck you, huh?

1281
01:49:36,248 --> 01:49:38,182
You're making me do this.

1282
01:49:38,617 --> 01:49:40,881
Now drop the goddamn gun.

1283
01:49:41,019 --> 01:49:42,680
Do what he says, Hobbes.

1284
01:49:47,526 --> 01:49:48,720
Jonesy.

1285
01:50:00,939 --> 01:50:02,930
Who else is out here, huh?

1286
01:50:03,041 --> 01:50:04,702
Lou?! Tiff, come on out!

1287
01:50:04,776 --> 01:50:06,573
No, it's just the two of us.

1288
01:50:10,215 --> 01:50:11,546
The gun, Hobbes.

1289
01:50:38,177 --> 01:50:40,338
Jonesy, you know I didn't do this.

1290
01:50:41,180 --> 01:50:43,444
You know I didn't do any of it.

1291
01:50:43,782 --> 01:50:45,249
I know that, Hobbes.

1292
01:50:45,317 --> 01:50:48,946
We both want to believe you,
but we gotta bring you in.

1293
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:03,331
Stan...

1294
01:51:04,403 --> 01:51:05,870
I don't know if I can do this.

1295
01:51:07,739 --> 01:51:09,570
What the fuck you talking...?

1296
01:51:10,242 --> 01:51:12,767
Say Hobbes disappears into the woods...

1297
01:51:13,312 --> 01:51:17,043
We drive his car into the lake.
End of story. What's wrong with that?

1298
01:51:17,115 --> 01:51:20,175
We bring the son of a bitch in.
That's why we're up here.

1299
01:51:20,252 --> 01:51:21,583
He did it, fine.

1300
01:51:21,687 --> 01:51:23,552
He didn't do it, even better.

1301
01:51:23,689 --> 01:51:27,557
But it's not our job to decide.
Now drop the goddamn gun.

1302
01:51:32,030 --> 01:51:33,361
Jonesy.

1303
01:51:35,834 --> 01:51:37,665
Put the goddamn gun down.

1304
01:51:47,946 --> 01:51:49,140
Okay.

1305
01:52:04,930 --> 01:52:06,022
Thank you.

1306
01:52:11,470 --> 01:52:12,869
I'm sorry, Stan.

1307
01:52:13,505 --> 01:52:17,271
Been on the force so many years you think
you've seen it all, but you haven't.

1308
01:52:17,342 --> 01:52:19,207
Life always gives you one more surprise.

1309
01:52:19,278 --> 01:52:20,472
One more.

1310
01:52:26,952 --> 01:52:28,647
Sometimes it's a big one.

1311
01:52:29,655 --> 01:52:30,679
Azazel.

1312
01:52:31,957 --> 01:52:33,652
I'm your partner, man.

1313
01:52:33,992 --> 01:52:35,391
You're free. Run.

1314
01:52:37,229 --> 01:52:38,526
Keep thinking, Hobbes.

1315
01:52:43,969 --> 01:52:45,436
How about that?!

1316
01:52:46,605 --> 01:52:49,073
Jonesy's fucked. He just killed his boss.

1317
01:52:51,476 --> 01:52:53,034
Jonesy's fucked!

1318
01:52:53,178 --> 01:52:54,577
You're fucked!

1319
01:52:54,980 --> 01:52:56,447
One at a time, huh?!

1320
01:52:56,915 --> 01:52:59,076
That's how we do it. One by one.

1321
01:53:00,619 --> 01:53:02,814
Olly-olly-oxen-free!

1322
01:53:04,756 --> 01:53:06,519
"Time

1323
01:53:08,060 --> 01:53:10,290
"Is on my side

1324
01:53:10,796 --> 01:53:12,730
"Yes, it is

1325
01:53:13,198 --> 01:53:14,893
"Time

1326
01:53:16,001 --> 01:53:17,468
"Is on my side"

1327
01:53:17,569 --> 01:53:19,400
You like the Stones, Hobbes?

1328
01:53:19,838 --> 01:53:22,830
I bet you didn't, you big Monkee fan pussy.

1329
01:53:28,347 --> 01:53:29,644
Time's up!

1330
01:53:31,149 --> 01:53:32,878
See the deal?!

1331
01:53:33,952 --> 01:53:35,749
If I kill you...

1332
01:53:38,190 --> 01:53:39,885
...it's just the final...

1333
01:53:40,192 --> 01:53:41,853
...pathetic chapter...

1334
01:53:42,294 --> 01:53:44,694
...in the life of a disgraced hero.

1335
01:53:46,231 --> 01:53:48,927
Just one more piece of shit human scum.

1336
01:53:51,002 --> 01:53:52,264
But...

1337
01:53:52,371 --> 01:53:53,736
...turn it around.

1338
01:53:55,340 --> 01:53:56,705
If I die...

1339
01:54:01,380 --> 01:54:03,041
...I enter you...

1340
01:54:04,015 --> 01:54:06,245
...put 20 more murders on your tab...

1341
01:54:07,119 --> 01:54:08,711
...before you go down.

1342
01:54:10,822 --> 01:54:13,120
Maybe your nephew or that...

1343
01:54:14,926 --> 01:54:16,894
...chippy you were talking to.

1344
01:54:18,663 --> 01:54:21,223
How do you want to do this?
I die, you die?

1345
01:54:21,400 --> 01:54:23,391
What's maximum fun? Can you guess...

1346
01:54:25,537 --> 01:54:27,368
...what maximum fun is?

1347
01:54:28,673 --> 01:54:30,038
Sure you can.

1348
01:54:31,943 --> 01:54:34,070
Now that I've played you
from the outside...

1349
01:54:34,513 --> 01:54:36,378
...maximum fun is...

1350
01:54:36,948 --> 01:54:38,745
...I become you.

1351
01:55:11,950 --> 01:55:14,851
You got me, Hobbes. You got me good.

1352
01:55:17,022 --> 01:55:18,853
But I gotta ask you something.

1353
01:55:19,724 --> 01:55:21,954
You wouldn't let me kill myself.
Why is that?

1354
01:55:22,527 --> 01:55:23,960
Because I need more time.

1355
01:55:24,396 --> 01:55:25,988
Time for what, asshole?

1356
01:55:28,066 --> 01:55:30,432
Five hundred cubits.
That's a long way, Azazel.

1357
01:55:31,436 --> 01:55:33,336
If Jonesy dies too fast...

1358
01:55:33,472 --> 01:55:35,303
...as powerful as you are...

1359
01:55:36,575 --> 01:55:38,440
...I might never get away from you.

1360
01:55:38,610 --> 01:55:40,635
Oh, he's catching on.

1361
01:55:41,580 --> 01:55:43,878
What? You think you're going to win?

1362
01:55:45,217 --> 01:55:46,514
God willing.

1363
01:55:53,291 --> 01:55:54,815
You never know.

1364
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:03,763
Let me ask you something.

1365
01:56:08,740 --> 01:56:10,435
Why do you think...

1366
01:56:11,343 --> 01:56:12,776
...Milano...

1367
01:56:13,278 --> 01:56:15,269
...came all the way out here...

1368
01:56:15,680 --> 01:56:17,147
...in the middle of nowhere?

1369
01:56:17,215 --> 01:56:19,183
To die, the little chickenshit.

1370
01:56:20,919 --> 01:56:22,250
I don't think so.

1371
01:56:24,022 --> 01:56:26,183
I think that he wanted to do...

1372
01:56:26,791 --> 01:56:28,486
...what I'm going to do.

1373
01:56:28,994 --> 01:56:31,827
- Only he couldn't pull it off.
- Pull what off?

1374
01:56:31,997 --> 01:56:33,589
Oh, come on, Azazel.

1375
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:36,797
Open your eyes.

1376
01:56:38,637 --> 01:56:40,195
Look around sometime.

1377
01:56:41,106 --> 01:56:44,007
Here we are, in this beautiful place...

1378
01:56:45,043 --> 01:56:48,012
...not another human being
around for miles.

1379
01:56:48,813 --> 01:56:50,303
It's just you and me.

1380
01:56:58,990 --> 01:57:01,550
What is this? You don't smoke anymore.

1381
01:57:07,132 --> 01:57:08,724
That's right. I don't.

1382
01:57:10,035 --> 01:57:11,229
You know why?

1383
01:57:14,406 --> 01:57:16,067
Because cigarettes kill.

1384
01:57:18,743 --> 01:57:21,143
Especially cigarettes laced with poison.

1385
01:57:23,748 --> 01:57:24,908
Bullshit.

1386
01:57:26,851 --> 01:57:29,581
Same poison that you used
to kill my brother.

1387
01:57:33,792 --> 01:57:34,986
Fuck you.

1388
01:57:36,361 --> 01:57:38,056
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1389
01:57:38,496 --> 01:57:39,861
Isn't it so sweet?

1390
01:57:40,765 --> 01:57:42,426
We die together...

1391
01:57:42,667 --> 01:57:44,157
...just you and me.

1392
01:57:51,576 --> 01:57:53,203
"Time

1393
01:57:55,180 --> 01:57:56,670
"Is on my side

1394
01:57:59,551 --> 01:58:00,984
"Yes, it is"

1395
01:58:01,186 --> 01:58:03,017
Fuck you, motherfucker!

1396
01:58:12,964 --> 01:58:14,329
I'm sorry, Jonesy.

1397
01:58:28,046 --> 01:58:29,206
I'm sorry.

1398
01:59:33,678 --> 01:59:36,545
So, like I said at the start...

1399
01:59:36,848 --> 01:59:38,213
...I was beaten...

1400
01:59:38,383 --> 01:59:41,011
...outsmarted, poisoned...

1401
01:59:41,119 --> 01:59:44,555
...by Detective John Hobbes.

1402
01:59:55,366 --> 01:59:59,632
Can you imagine what it feels like
to be alive for thousands of years...

1403
01:59:59,904 --> 02:00:02,737
...and realize you're actually going to die...

1404
02:00:02,907 --> 02:00:07,469
...because some self-righteous cop decided
he was going to save the fucking world?

1405
02:00:10,281 --> 02:00:12,146
Yes, a demon can die...

1406
02:00:12,650 --> 02:00:16,017
...and Hobbes figured out
how to beat me at my own game.

1407
02:00:16,421 --> 02:00:17,683
So what?

1408
02:00:19,257 --> 02:00:21,589
The war isn't over, I promise you.

1409
02:00:22,727 --> 02:00:24,319
Not by a long shot.

1410
02:00:42,680 --> 02:00:44,773
You forgot something, didn't you?

1411
02:00:46,818 --> 02:00:49,309
At the beginning I said
I was going to tell you...

1412
02:00:49,387 --> 02:00:52,515
...about the time I almost died.

1413
02:00:59,764 --> 02:01:01,288
See you around.

1414
02:00:59,764 --> 02:01:01,288
See you around.
