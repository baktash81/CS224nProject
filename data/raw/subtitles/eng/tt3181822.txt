1
00:00:58,025 --> 00:01:00,369
I wanna come home, Claire.
Let me come home.

2
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:02,502
Please.
Just get out.

3
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:04,540
Get out!

4
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,877
Don't tell me Dad's not coming back.
Don't tell me that.

5
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,610
Kevin, wait. Kevin?

6
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:25,285
Claire.

7
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:27,058
I love you like a sister,
but you have got to

8
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,622
get those divorce
papers signed

9
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:30,030
and move on.

10
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:32,862
It's been nine months.

11
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,530
What? Are you having
second thoughts?

12
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:36,471
I'm having dinner.

13
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:37,906
With Garrett?

14
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:39,977
oh, you pussy!

15
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:41,705
It's for Kevin's birthday.

16
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:45,215
Honestly, Vicky, sometimes I
think you're rooting against us.

17
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:46,307
Who's "us"?

18
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:47,783
You and me,
or you and him,

19
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:49,114
because I kinda
thought that was done.

20
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,555
He's the father of my kid.

21
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,421
Who cheats
with the secretary

22
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,551
every time he goes
to the home office.

23
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:56,954
Brings a whole new meaning

24
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,290
to "the San Francisco Treat."

25
00:01:58,385 --> 00:01:59,420
Not funny.

26
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:02,329
He said she smelt like chocolate
chip cookies.

27
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:04,265
Goodbye. I'm just
quoting his email.

28
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:07,305
You don't have to! Okay?

29
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:11,139
Because it's
burned in my mind.

30
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:12,574
Forever.

31
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:19,977
And for your information, he doesn't
go to San Francisco anymore.

32
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:24,779
So, stop bringing it up.
It's not fair.

33
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:26,586
Ta-da!
Make a wish.

34
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:27,785
Happy birthday!

35
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:30,653
You made that?
Of course!

36
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:32,355
Come on. I've been
waiting all day.

37
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:33,760
I want you to see this.

38
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:36,525
Okay.
I'll help you.

39
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:38,000
One, two, three!

40
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:39,965
Ta-da!

41
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:42,769
Oh' my G“! Dam
Huh?

42
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,035
It's like a high-powered

43
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:46,634
gaming tower
with an arctic cooler.

44
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,701
And you made this?

45
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:49,940
Three weekends in a row.
Triple processor.

46
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,176
Dad, thank you so much.

47
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,945
Let's do cake.

48
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:58,149
What are you guys
doing for Labor Day?

49
00:02:58,211 --> 00:02:59,781
I don't know. Why?

50
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,689
I thought we'd go camping
like the old days.

51
00:03:01,815 --> 00:03:04,022
Mom, too? Yeah, of course.
That's what I was thinking.

52
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:05,824
Oh, it will be a lot of fun.
We could catch fish,

53
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:07,126
and, Mom,
you could cook it.

54
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,530
Yeah, that sounds
like a lot of fun.

55
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:09,965
Please?

56
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,367
Look at you, you got schmutz everywhere.
Go clean up.

57
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:14,735
Okay. All right,
be rig ht back.

58
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:16,466
Come on, what do you say?

59
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:17,835
Um...

60
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,834
When were you
thinking of going?

61
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:22,570
I get back from
a business trip

62
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,148
the Thursday
before Labor Day.

63
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:25,814
Business trip?

64
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,317
Yep. Get back
Thursday night,

65
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:28,512
we'll leave, three days.

66
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:29,645
Where?

67
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,814
That old cabin we used to
go to at Mammoth Lakes.

68
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,880
That sounds great!

69
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:38,188
No, I meant where
is your business trip?

70
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:42,326
Let me guess. San Francisco?

71
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:44,393
It's work.
It's not what you think.

72
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:46,030
Does she still work there?

73
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:47,695
Claire, it doesn't matter.

74
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:49,502
No, I guess
it doesn't matter.

75
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:51,903
Mom?
Yeah?

76
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:53,409
So, you coming or not?

77
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,672
Mmm. You know what?

78
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,181
That's the weekend
before school starts.

79
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,775
So, you know, you guys should
just keep it a guy trip.

80
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:03,252
You'll have a blast.

81
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:04,788
Okay
Okay

82
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:36,377
Kevin!
Honey, we gotta go.

83
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:39,321
Kevin!

84
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:40,755
I know.

85
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:44,893
Mom, the door is jammed.

86
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,589
Mom, look,
can we just forget it?

87
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,929
Because I don't wanna
see another doctor, okay?

88
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:50,662
He's not gonna tell you
anything any different.

89
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:53,067
He is the best allergist
in the Valley, okay?

90
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,298
We're going.
You know what?

91
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,497
I'll lift the door,
you pull the cord.

92
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:59,577
Okay. Okay.

93
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:02,672
Okay, you ready, Mom?

94
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,742
Just pull it up! It's too heavy.

95
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,285
It's too heavy.
Pull it up, baby.

96
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,013
I got n.

97
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:12,521
I can fix that
for you if you want.

98
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:15,151
And you are?

99
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,091
My nephew.

100
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,788
Oh, hey, Mr. Sandborn.

101
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:21,833
Noah. I'm staying
next door with my uncle.

102
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:22,992
Claire.

103
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:24,659
He's hereto help me

104
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:27,329
when I get the, uh'
bone marrow transport.

105
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:28,462
Right.

106
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:30,472
"Transplant," Uncle Bob.
"Transplant."

107
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,668
Oh, yeah.

108
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:34,109
He's got a real knack
for fixing things.

109
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,169
I can, uh, lake a
look at this real quick.

110
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:37,946
Hey, how you doing?
I'm Noah.

111
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,642
Kevin. Yeah. Um...

112
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,278
I don't know
what the issue is.

113
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,116
It might be
off the track, but...

114
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,019
Nah. Actually,
it's the clutch.

115
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:47,352
We can get another one at the
hardware store if you want.

116
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:48,619
You wanna go? Come on.

117
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,663
Well, you know, we actually
had somewhere to be,

118
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:54,028
but now that
we're gonna be late...

119
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,121
Mom?

120
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,331
Okay

121
00:05:58,391 --> 00:05:59,893
Go ahead.
Cool.

122
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:02,166
All right. It was nice meeting you.
You, too.

123
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:03,230
Uncle Bob'?
Are you gonna be okay?

124
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,707
Yeah, sure, I'm fine.

125
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:06,141
Look at me.

126
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,577
Hey. Love you.
MR. SANDBORN: Love you, too.

127
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:10,804
His parents died last year.

128
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:14,314
I'm all he's got now
in the way of family.

129
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,812
He seems like a nice boy.

130
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,322
Yeah, he is.

131
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,881
You up for some coffee?

132
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:22,756
Yeah, sure. Sure.
Come on.

133
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,652
So, the entire time,
it was the clutch.

134
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:26,823
Mm-hmm.

135
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,999
How old are you,
anyway?

136
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,659
Almost 20.

137
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:31,896
But you're not
from around here.

138
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:34,097
No. San Bernardino.

139
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:37,107
My uncle, actually,
my great-uncle, uh,

140
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:39,006
he needed help,
I needed a change,

141
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,443
so I figured I'd go
back to school here.

142
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:42,945
You mean college?

143
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:45,376
There was this, uh...

144
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:46,678
Accident.

145
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,515
So, I lost some time.

146
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,248
So, I'm gonna finish up
at Monroe High.

147
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,423
That's where I go. My mom
teaches there, actually.

148
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:56,690
She seems way too cool
to be a teacher.

149
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:57,784
She is cool.

150
00:06:57,951 --> 00:06:59,123
For a mom.

151
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,930
Okay. We got everything.

152
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:04,764
Good to go?
Yeah, let's go.

153
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:06,235
Okay

154
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:07,636
Here you go, sir.
Thank you.

155
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:10,230
Whoa.

156
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,534
Can you, uh, pay for this?

157
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,540
What?
Uh...

158
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,444
Look,
that's Allie Callahan, okay?

159
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,482
She's the most
beautiful girl in school

160
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:20,983
and I just can't think when I'm around her.
So, just, can you...

161
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:22,553
I don't know.
I hate to tell you this,

162
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,213
but she's already seen you.

163
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:25,483
Just go on
and talk to her.

164
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:26,613
And say what?

165
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:30,119
Just tell her,

166
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:32,628
"Here are some garage parts.
How much?"

167
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,630
Go!
Wow. Very funny. Yeah.

168
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:35,825
Come on.
Thank you.

169
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,164
You want me to fail.

170
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:42,228
Hi.
Hi, Kevin.

171
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,798
Hi, Allie. Um, I didn't
know you worked here.

172
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:46,668
My dad's making
my brother and me

173
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,076
do split shifts
to earn gas money.

174
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,512
It could be worse.

175
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:52,583
If you didn't have a brother,
you'd be working full time.

176
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,913
Noah Sandborn.

177
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,817
Allie. Nice to meet you.

178
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:56,979
Nice to meet you, too.

179
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:58,488
I'm friends
with Kevin here.

180
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:00,255
I'm gonna go look around.

181
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,519
Okay, sure.

182
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:04,523
So, you're having
a good day?

183
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:05,755
Yeah.
Great.

184
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,492
How about you?
Actually...

185
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:12,764
Hey, check it out.

186
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,431
LOOK who it is! Whiz!

187
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:16,666
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

188
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:17,833
Okay, okay!

189
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:20,002
Jason! Guys!
FORREST: Did you pee-pee?

190
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,636
Oh, what is this, huh? Come on.

191
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:22,941
Is this your EpiPen?

192
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,539
Your little
penis purse?

193
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:27,117
You guys, stop it!
Get out of the store!

194
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:29,016
The kid still pisses the bed.
All three of you, get out!

195
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:31,487
Okay, all right,
fine, fine.

196
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:34,455
See you later, Whizzy. Stay away
from liquids. 

197
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:37,490
Hey, Noah,
are you ready to go?

198
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:40,861
Uh, Allie, how much
is this gonna be?

199
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:42,831
I'll ring n up.

200
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:45,728
Clutch is in.
We're all good.

201
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,236
You thirsty?

202
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:49,368
Yeah.

203
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:52,238
Thanks for fixing the door.
And for including him.

204
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,570
Hey, there was this kid
at the hardware store

205
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:57,204
giving him a hard time.

206
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,847
Jason Zimmer?

207
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,377
Um, skater kid, red hair,

208
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:03,647
permanently dumb look
on his face?

209
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:07,321
That would be the one. Kept
on calling him "The Whiz.“

210
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:13,362
He actually had an incident

211
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,058
a couple of years ago
on a playground

212
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:18,568
where he got stung by a bee,
and his throat swelled up

213
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:21,229
and he panicked

214
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:23,338
and lost control.

215
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,875
Whiz.
Whiz.

216
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,369
on, man.

217
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:29,673
Kids can be cruel. Especially
kids like Jason Zimmer.

218
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:33,347
But, please,
don't tell him I told you.

219
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,510
He'd be mortified.

220
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:37,218
You can trust me.

221
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:42,588
Anyways, uh, you're all set.

222
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:47,754
This is very exciting. Very
exciting moment.

223
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:52,870
It works!

224
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:56,601
Thank you.

225
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,809
I'm gonna take off
this cover real quick.

226
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:44,911
Put it over there.
On the ground?

227
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:46,682
Uh, wherever. Just set
it down, doesn't matter.

228
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:47,814
Set it down'?
Yeah.

229
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:49,518
All right, now this
bad boy right here

230
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:51,186
is the alternator.
You know what this does?

231
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:53,093
No.
It charges the battery.

232
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,632
So, I'm gonna
do one piece of it,

233
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:56,427
you're gonna do the other, all right?
All right.

234
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:58,025
All right?
Yeah.

235
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,669
You're actually
going the opposite way.

236
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:02,762
Yeah.

237
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:03,967
All right, we're gonna
check out the alternator.

238
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,476
You're loosening it up
rather than tightening it.

239
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,313
How's that?

240
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:12,640
It's in there. You wanna
finish it off, Noah?

241
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:14,207
I'll just do it in there.

242
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,681
Okay.

243
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,883
Yeah, this one
needs two...

244
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:24,853
Make sure it's
actually in there.

245
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:26,453
To the right?

246
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:52,881
Okay,
I'm changing the subject.

247
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:56,059
Um, how long will your
uncle be in the hospital?

248
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:57,651
Um, I don't know.

249
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:00,259
It's all about
the transplant taking.

250
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,558
Well, until he's better, you
can come over for dinner here

251
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:04,999
anytime, okay?

252
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,765
I don't want you eating
by yourself. I mean it.

253
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,770
Thanks, but I don't
wanna impose.

254
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,675
Oh, I do. Especially if
she's making the guacamole.

255
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,404
You are not an imposition.

256
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:14,910
Are you saying I am?
Mmm.

257
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:16,537
Well, in that case,
l wouldn't mind

258
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:17,843
imposing on your
literature class.

259
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:21,085
Oh, no, dude,
you don't wanna do that.

260
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:22,414
They call her
"The Crusher."

261
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:23,714
Is that what they call me?

262
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:24,777
Yes.
Yeah.

263
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:26,221
You know what? Carry your own plate.

264
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:27,518
Clean up all the dishes.

265
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:31,386
Now he's really
worried about it.

266
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:34,626
Strange kid.

267
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:35,927
Why?

268
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:38,032
Can't put my finger on it.

269
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,430
Don't try so hard.

270
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,204
Okay. He's interested
in literature?

271
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:46,938
In the classics.

272
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:49,536
Back in San Bernardino,
we were studying the Odyssey.

273
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:51,712
You want me to help
you outwith that?

274
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,944
Sure. Here you go.

275
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,781
You know, I'm teaching
Homer next semester.

276
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,149
Really? He's my favorite.

277
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,480
You're kidding, right?

278
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:00,216
Second that.

279
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,123
Dude, you gotta
read the Iliad.

280
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:04,592
Achilles is this
total badass.

281
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:05,957
Hot-tempered, full of pride,

282
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:08,089
completely consumed
by his emotions.

283
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,426
You know what he
called Agamemnon?

284
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:10,593
Who?

285
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,166
"A pitiful excuse
for a king."

286
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,906
To his face.

287
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:17,573
He killed this guy, Hector.

288
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,938
But instead of hiding out
like a pussy, he...

289
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:21,239
Dragged his dead body around
for everybody to see.

290
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,747
Yes! He stood by his
actions, right or wrong.

291
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,579
Well, because to him
they were justified.

292
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,243
Do you have any idea
what they're talking about?

293
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:30,015
No.
No.

294
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:35,123
Homer's a genius,
my man.

295
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:39,254
Just like Shakespeare,
Byron, Zeppelin, Dylan.

296
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:40,489
Ugh.

297
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:42,130
Poets.

298
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:44,124
Poets.

299
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:48,967
Poets.

300
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:00,281
I'll have him
back Sunday afternoon!

301
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,149
Bye, Mom, I love you!

302
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,704
Oh, hey, Noah,
come on in.

303
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:27,368
You know,
Kevin already left.

304
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:30,710
Actually, I, uh, picked
something up for you.

305
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,551
Oh, my God,
this is a first edition?

306
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:42,182
I can't accept this, this
must have cost a fortune!

307
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:45,058
It was a buck at a garage sale.
One man's trash.“

308
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:49,394
Noah, I can't.
Honestly...

309
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:50,490
Claire, please!

310
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,194
I've been eating here
every single night.

311
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:53,669
It would mean a lot to me.

312
00:14:58,331 --> 00:14:59,503
Thank you.

313
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:05,447
Those yours?
Oh, no.

314
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:07,708
They were a gift
from Vicky.

315
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,542
Why?

316
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:13,248
Those kind of shoes are for
women trying to be sexy.

317
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:15,522
You don't need to try.

318
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:21,222
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have, uh...

319
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,624
No. No, it's okay.

320
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:51,846
Where are you?

321
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:53,184
Almost there.

322
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,519
Well, hurry up!

323
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:55,684
Vicky, I can't do this!

324
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:57,158
I haven't had a date
in 18 years,

325
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:59,162
I don't even know
what to do anymore!

326
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:01,730
Three things.
One, laugh a lot.

327
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:03,892
Two, take off
your wedding ring.

328
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,867
Three, give him head.
What?

329
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,336
Kidding!
Just get here, pronto!

330
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:14,201
And the closer
I get to this car,

331
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,803
the smell is getting stronger
and stronger.

332
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,074
And I walk up to
the guy's window,

333
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:20,548
rolls down the window,

334
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,211
I look and on
the passenger seat is

335
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:24,678
his dead dog!

336
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:26,320
You did not tell me that.

337
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:29,724
So, Ethan tells me you teach.

338
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:30,885
English, is it?

339
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:33,224
The classics.
Wow.

340
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,925
What does that mean?

341
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:37,558
Oh. No, he just
means as a compliment,

342
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:39,568
like, "Wow, you teach
the classics."

343
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:43,098
It's fancy.

344
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:45,197
I mean, I don't know

345
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:46,709
how many kids nowadays
are going to use

346
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:49,110
what they learn
from classics.

347
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:51,681
No offense.

348
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,047
Oh, none taken.
lam a vice principal

349
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:56,017
and I just want to see
these kids employed.

350
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,247
Shall we order?

351
00:17:57,777 --> 00:17:59,757
Silly me,
I just want them educated.

352
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:01,523
I'm fine with education,

353
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,458
but we gotta
get them working.

354
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:06,792
Practical skills.
That's where the money is.

355
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,526
Ah! Money!
That's the goal, then.

356
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:12,202
Oh. Ethan,
how's your mom?

357
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:13,595
Gallstones.

358
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:15,536
Oh, gallstones.
Mm-hmm.

359
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,597
Are those the ones you pass'?
Or are those the other stones?

360
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:18,903
Yeah,
she's getting better.

361
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:22,037
You know, money's fine, except
when it's motivated by greed.

362
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:26,448
You're a little firecracker when
you get riled up, aren't you?

363
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:27,745
I think it stopped raining.

364
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:29,218
Firecracker?

365
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:31,585
Is that how you regard
women with an opinion?

366
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:34,214
Only when they
disagree with mine.

367
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:41,960
Pleasure to meet you, Benny.

368
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:43,727
No, Claire,
stay, stay!

369
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,663
J. K. Rowling.

370
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:51,067
I'm sorry?

371
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,302
Billionaire.

372
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:53,934
Classics major.

373
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:57,975
She's a lot of laughs.

374
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:01,240
You gotta get to know her.

375
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:02,368
Hello?
Question.

376
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:06,746
I tried to defrost
a chicken in the microwave.

377
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:09,581
And some of it's
kind of cooked,

378
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:11,382
some of it's kind of not.

379
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:12,581
Do you think
it's still cool to

380
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,351
eat the cooked part?

381
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:17,019
No! Do not eat that!

382
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:19,893
Then, please, come over
and bail me out. Um...

383
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:21,929
Um... Uh...

384
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:24,059
Okay.

385
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:25,897
Perfect. Okay.

386
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:27,197
Yes.

387
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:28,429
See you soon.

388
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:30,097
Okay

389
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:40,676
I mean,
that date was awful.

390
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,383
Like that chicken.

391
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:45,580
I'm sorry I couldn't salvage
it more, but... You did fine.

392
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:46,782
The damage was done.

393
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:49,860
Yeah. I'm glad
I had you next door.

394
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:54,923
What?

395
00:20:57,189 --> 00:21:00,363
God, you're beautiful.
You know that?

396
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,303
Oh, no, I'm...

397
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:04,203
Amazing.

398
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:08,307
And sweet,
natural and sexy.

399
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:12,882
So sexy.

400
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,417
Noah!

401
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:16,285
Kiss me, Claire.
Just...

402
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,377
I can't.
Just once.

403
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:20,821
Please.
I have to go.

404
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,061
Tonight, in the window...

405
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:26,719
You were watching me.

406
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:30,056
I can't do this!

407
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:32,629
Noah!

408
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:34,295
I want to watch you now.

409
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:37,237
This can't happen.
We can't.

410
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,570
It's wrong!

411
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:45,746
It doesn't feel wrong,
does it?

412
00:21:53,913 --> 00:21:55,324
Wait.
It feels so...

413
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:57,257
Oh, my God, stop.

414
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,590
...nice.

415
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:05,097
Soft.

416
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,763
Please, please stop.

417
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:17,174
Noah, please!

418
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,944
Stop.

419
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,351
No judgments.

420
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:27,956
No rules.

421
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,355
Justus.

422
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:33,953
Oh, my God.

423
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,226
A woman like you

424
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:38,029
should be cherished.

425
00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:39,803
Loved.

426
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:45,209
Let me love you, Claire.

427
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:41,861
You are perfect

428
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:44,558
in every way.

429
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:58,839
oh, my God!

430
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:13,016
Hey! Where are you going?

431
00:25:13,312 --> 00:25:14,620
Home.

432
00:25:15,381 --> 00:25:16,382
I gotta get home.

433
00:25:16,482 --> 00:25:17,620
No, you don't.

434
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:19,959
Kevin doesn't get home till later.
Have some coffee.

435
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:21,154
I can't. This...

436
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,528
Was incredible.

437
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:29,363
Hey, you're having second
thoughts, it's normal.

438
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:31,031
This isn't normal, okay?

439
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,542
Nothing about this
is normal.

440
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:35,009
Where's my coat?

441
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,208
Would you just stop
for one minute'?

442
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:40,408
Look, Noah,
I don't want you to think

443
00:25:40,506 --> 00:25:42,144
that any of this
was your fault, okay?

444
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,880
I'm the adult, I'm the one
that should've known...

445
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:47,219
Stop, stop! Just stop!

446
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:48,882
What we did wasn't wrong.
No matter what you say,

447
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:50,153
it wasn't wrong!

448
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,990
I wasn't thinking
clearly, okay?

449
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:54,759
I got swept up in the moment.
I was vulnerable

450
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:57,993
and you're very sweet.
No.

451
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:00,333
And it was flattering, but I...
No.

452
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,568
It was more than that.

453
00:26:08,167 --> 00:26:09,510
God damn it!

454
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:17,848
Noah, look,

455
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:19,547
it wasn't more
than that, okay.

456
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:21,090
I was feeling vulnerable.

457
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:24,389
How can you say that?
Last night was so perfect.

458
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,452
Because it's true.

459
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:28,360
And in time, you're
going to see it, too.

460
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:36,137
Just leave.

461
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:38,374
Go! A's You okay?

462
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:04,490
Mom, we caught seven trout.

463
00:27:05,257 --> 00:27:06,736
Wow!

464
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:10,301
Yeah, he was, uh,
pretty amazing.

465
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:12,136
Uh, Mom, can Dad
stay for dinner?

466
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:14,910
Um...
Please?

467
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:16,446
Dad?

468
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:21,406
Please?
Sure.

469
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:26,817
I saw this video
on YouTube,

470
00:27:26,912 --> 00:27:28,983
where this, just like, big,
you know, mountain dude

471
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:31,652
who lives all alone in
this old shack in Montana.

472
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,252
And he cooks all
his food on a shovel.

473
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:35,787
No, you didn't.
We did.

474
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:38,300
I mean, we wrap it up
in tinfoil first...

475
00:27:38,357 --> 00:27:39,768
And eat off the shovel?

476
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:41,771
Yeah, well, the
foil-covered shovel.

477
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:43,670
It was a great meal.
It was delicious.

478
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:45,673
Yeah, it was, like, one of the
best meals I've ever had.

479
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:47,001
Oh! Thank you!

480
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:48,169
No. No offense, Mom.

481
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:51,441
You know what I mean.
I don't mean it like that.

482
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:53,446
This was great.

483
00:27:55,274 --> 00:27:56,878
What do you
think she made?

484
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:58,215
I bet you it's cookies.

485
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:13,827
I'll get ii.

486
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:15,064
You want any coffee?

487
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,639
Yeah,
I'll have some if you are!

488
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,803
Noah! What's up?

489
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:20,866
Hey, man,
you're back.

490
00:28:20,966 --> 00:28:22,172
How was the trip?

491
00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:24,544
Hey, Dad,
this is, uh, Noah.

492
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:25,979
Remember, I've been
talking about him a lot?

493
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:27,346
Hey, nice to meet you!

494
00:28:27,406 --> 00:28:29,716
I feel like I know you,
he talks about you so much.

495
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:32,880
Told me about the alternator
you put in the truck.

496
00:28:32,978 --> 00:28:35,254
Oh, actually,
Kevin helped out, too, so...

497
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:36,553
Yeah?
Yeah, I did.

498
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:37,683
Yeah. It was so cool.

499
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:39,023
I had no idea
you could do that yourself.

500
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:40,154
That's what
friends are for.

501
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:41,220
Hey, Mrs. Peterson.

502
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,492
Hey, Noah.

503
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,589
Wow, looks perfect.

504
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:45,100
You tell them what
happened this weekend?

505
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,261
What happened?

506
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:49,339
Oh, there was a big
thunderstorm up here.

507
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,839
You guys didn't
get it up there?

508
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:52,876
No, beautiful,
dry as a bone at the lake.

509
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:55,002
Well, it got
pretty wet here.

510
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,101
Wow.

511
00:28:57,169 --> 00:28:59,706
You know what, big day tomorrow.
First day of school.

512
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:00,943
It's getting kind of late.

513
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,109
But it's, like, 8:30.

514
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:04,847
No, no, no. Actually, I gotta get going.
It's a big day tomorrow.

515
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:06,920
I'll walk outwith you,
Mr. Peterson.

516
00:29:07,012 --> 00:29:08,719
Oh, I'm going to stay
around awhile, thanks.

517
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,225
Well, you know, I'll
walk out with you, Noah.

518
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,293
Yeah, come on.

519
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:14,261
Uh, do you want to take
a cookie for the road?

520
00:29:14,353 --> 00:29:15,696
I love your
mother's cookies.

521
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:16,755
They're great, right?

522
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,236
Nice to meet you.
Yeah. You, too, pal.

523
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:24,535
Nice kid.

524
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,447
You know, we need
to figure out

525
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:35,643
what we're doing here, Garrett.

526
00:29:35,741 --> 00:29:37,049
What do you mean?

527
00:29:39,044 --> 00:29:42,116
I mean, we're in limbo here

528
00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:45,559
and maybe, you know,
it's just time to move on.

529
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:46,994
I'm not seeing her
anymore.

530
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:49,622
But you might as well be, because
I'm always going to think you are

531
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:51,166
and I don't want
to live that way.

532
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:53,099
And you shouldn't want
to live that way, either.

533
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:55,798
Hey, it wasn't about her.
It was about us.

534
00:29:56,595 --> 00:29:58,734
Okay? We were broken.

535
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:01,400
We both checked out.

536
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:03,770
I'm not saying what I did
was right, it wasn't.

537
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:05,143
It was...

538
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:07,148
It was stupid.

539
00:30:07,673 --> 00:30:10,176
Smart people do dumb things.
They make mistakes.

540
00:30:11,076 --> 00:30:13,283
Haven't you ever
made a mistake?

541
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:15,649
Don't throw
our marriage away

542
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:17,192
because I made a mistake.

543
00:30:18,684 --> 00:30:20,527
Don't file. Not yet.

544
00:30:23,255 --> 00:30:25,496
Just take...
Take some time.

545
00:30:32,097 --> 00:30:33,940
All right.

546
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:38,003
Come on.

547
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:04,200
Welcome, everybody,

548
00:31:04,296 --> 00:31:05,969
to the start of
a brand-new year.

549
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:08,701
This year,
we are studying

550
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,713
Homer's Iliad
and its themes.

551
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:14,907
The first one we'll be studying
is the wrath of Achilles.

552
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:16,908
Mrs. Peterson.

553
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:20,415
Principal Warren,
what a nice surprise.

554
00:31:20,512 --> 00:31:22,014
Good news.
I've approved your request

555
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,991
for Noah Sandborn
to join your class.

556
00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:31,396
"No man or woman born,
coward or brave,

557
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,601
"can shun his destiny!"

558
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:38,007
I think it was Achilles
who said that, right?

559
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:42,674
Wait!

560
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,013
Ed?

561
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:46,580
Wait!

562
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:48,241
Wait a second.

563
00:31:48,607 --> 00:31:50,883
This is a class
for AP juniors,

564
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:53,183
Noah Sandborn
is a transfer senior, so...

565
00:31:53,445 --> 00:31:55,516
I'm confused.

566
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,457
Your transfer request
said, yeah,

567
00:31:57,549 --> 00:31:59,392
that he'd be an asset
to the class.

568
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:05,769
This was your email.

569
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:08,129
That's right. Thank you.

570
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:10,604
Have a great year.

571
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,461
Hey!

572
00:32:42,828 --> 00:32:44,569
Stop following me!

573
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,631
I'm not following you, Claire.

574
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:47,937
I live next door.

575
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:05,989
Kevin!

576
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:07,358
Yeah?

577
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:09,591
Did you send an email
from my account

578
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:10,997
to Principal Warren?

579
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,601
No, why?

580
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:16,465
Because somebody did.

581
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:21,978
It sounds like
you've been hacked.

582
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,773
You should really
change your password.

583
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,781
You know, I'd be happy to help
you outwith that, if you want.

584
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,145
No, thanks.

585
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:30,347
Hey, you ready to go?

586
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:31,648
Yeah!

587
00:33:32,444 --> 00:33:33,445
Kevin!

588
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:36,692
Noah, can you give us
a second, please?

589
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:41,492
You can wait
for him outside.

590
00:33:42,454 --> 00:33:43,865
Yeah, I'll be
down in a minute.

591
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:45,059
Oh, sure, yeah.

592
00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:48,399
Mom, that was really rude.
Why'd you do that?

593
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:49,972
He's here way too much.

594
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,234
You're the one who
told him he could be

595
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:52,535
and he's coming
to dinner tonight.

596
00:33:52,631 --> 00:33:54,702
No, your dad's
coming to dinner tonight.

597
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,142
So, why can't
he come, too?

598
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:58,981
I want it to just be
the three of us, okay?

599
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:02,243
Okay, yeah.
Okay.

600
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,184
All right.
I'll see you later, then.

601
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:10,422
My Uncle Bob was
a tail gunner in Korea,

602
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:12,859
and a sergeant in Vietnam.

603
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:14,829
Tough old dude.

604
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:17,830
Now he's laying
in Valley Memorial,

605
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,335
hoping the transplant takes.

606
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:22,429
Here, you got that?

607
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:23,938
Thanks.

608
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:30,074
Your dad seems to be
around a lot now, huh?

609
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:31,946
Yeah, I guess.

610
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,510
Like a dinner
and a camping trip

611
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:38,521
can just make you forget about
how he walked out on you.

612
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:45,121
Yeah, it's so predictable.

613
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:46,559
A guy hits middle age,

614
00:34:46,618 --> 00:34:48,620
and suddenly
staring death in the face.

615
00:34:48,787 --> 00:34:50,027
You know,
tire around the waist,

616
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,192
hair in the drain,

617
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:52,758
cock that just
won't stand up anymore.

618
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:54,063
He wants to
feel alive again.

619
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:55,195
He wants to
feel that rush,

620
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,701
you know, he felt
when he was our age.

621
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:03,037
So, he picks up
a younger woman and poof!

622
00:35:04,636 --> 00:35:06,138
Whole new life.

623
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:09,711
Go ahead and aim.

624
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:18,928
Almost.
Little better, right?

625
00:35:18,984 --> 00:35:20,986
Yeah. Here,
switch with me real quick.

626
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:24,928
Then the guilt sets in.

627
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:27,766
Because he basically just left
the first kid in the dust.

628
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:29,933
So, he tries to bribe him.

629
00:35:30,562 --> 00:35:32,098
With things.

630
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:36,308
Like computers.

631
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:46,145
Wow.

632
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:49,990
You follow me?

633
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:55,495
So, what's up?
How's school?

634
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:57,699
It is what it is.

635
00:35:57,789 --> 00:35:59,632
Tell him about
your computer class.

636
00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:01,830
He's learning how to
write his own software.

637
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:03,166
Like father, like son.

638
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:06,265
That's cool. We can
do some stuff together.

639
00:36:07,766 --> 00:36:09,712
I dropped it.
What?

640
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:12,945
I dropped it.
It was boring.

641
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:15,880
Going out for boxing now.

642
00:36:16,141 --> 00:36:18,621
You're going out for boxing?
You don't like boxing!

643
00:36:19,144 --> 00:36:20,623
How would you know?

644
00:36:21,046 --> 00:36:22,354
How would you know?

645
00:36:22,447 --> 00:36:24,449
Seriously, how would you know what
I like and what I don't like?

646
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:25,688
Am I missing something here?

647
00:36:25,784 --> 00:36:26,888
Yeah!

648
00:36:26,985 --> 00:36:28,965
Okay. You've been missing it
for nine months, Dad!

649
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,363
You just can't
come back in here

650
00:36:30,455 --> 00:36:31,991
and expect to pick up,
like nothing happened!

651
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,498
All right, Kevin,
that's enough!

652
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:36,004
No! Mom, he's gotta
hear this! Okay.

653
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:38,007
Life's been happening, Dad.

654
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:42,709
You know what, Mom,
I got homework to do.

655
00:36:42,801 --> 00:36:45,975
Kevin, wait. At least
finish your dinner!

656
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,880
Let him go.

657
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:49,315
He just probably
needs some space.

658
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:02,427
Here we go.
Yeah, yeah.

659
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:07,062
Hey, uh, how was
dinner with your dad?

660
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,696
Let's just take a break,
all right'?

661
00:37:10,762 --> 00:37:12,708
No, keep going!

662
00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:14,368
Come on, talk to me.
Dinner?

663
00:37:16,935 --> 00:37:18,608
God, I was a jerk, okay?

664
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:20,876
I feel really bad about it.

665
00:37:20,939 --> 00:37:23,078
No! No! Dude' that's good.

666
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:25,085
It means he knows
you're onto his bullshit.

667
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:27,952
We just have to hope that
your mom doesn't fall for it.

668
00:37:28,046 --> 00:37:29,957
Can't let her, uh,
be his meantime girl.

669
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:32,388
What's that?

670
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,726
You know, someone he
screws in the meantime.

671
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:38,693
Hey, uh, come on.

672
00:37:39,524 --> 00:37:41,367
Someone he screws
in the meantime?

673
00:37:43,895 --> 00:37:45,465
Yeah. Put your body
into it, there we go!

674
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:47,372
Kev! Take it easy, Kev!

675
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:48,906
Calm down!

676
00:37:49,067 --> 00:37:51,479
Easy' easy! Kev!

677
00:37:51,903 --> 00:37:53,211
Hey! Hey! Hey!

678
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,773
Kev! Kev!

679
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:56,976
What do I do?
What do I do?

680
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:58,410
God damn it!

681
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,887
Where's your pen?
Where's your pen?

682
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:12,733
Shit!

683
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:18,802
Kev. Kev, I got it!
What do I do with it?

684
00:38:18,897 --> 00:38:20,137
Oh, my God!

685
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:22,976
Where do I put this?

686
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:24,803
BOY: Shove it in the leg!

687
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:30,909
Is it working?

688
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,818
You good?

689
00:38:35,947 --> 00:38:37,153
Oh, my...

690
00:38:37,582 --> 00:38:39,755
Are you all right?

691
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:41,525
Oh, my God.

692
00:38:44,956 --> 00:38:46,458
You're not dying
on me today, okay.

693
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:48,501
God! Get over here!

694
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:04,384
Garrett's coming on
a little strong,

695
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:06,113
don't you think?

696
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:08,118
What makes you think they're
from Garrett?

697
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:12,450
Did you read my card?

698
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,154
Would I read your card?

699
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:22,629
"Please give me
another chance"

700
00:39:23,962 --> 00:39:25,407
What? It's a thin envelope.

701
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:26,667
Ugh.

702
00:39:27,165 --> 00:39:29,145
Tell me you're not going to.

703
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:30,974
I'm thinking about it.

704
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,538
Oh, no. No, no, no.
Oh, I know! I know.

705
00:39:33,638 --> 00:39:34,981
Let's tell him
to take his cookies

706
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,245
and shove 'em
right up his ass.

707
00:39:36,341 --> 00:39:38,912
You know what? Enough
with the cookie jokes.

708
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:41,513
We've all done things in our lives
that we wish we wouldn't have.

709
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:44,754
You know what?
Maybe you should start

710
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:46,590
worrying about yourself
for a change.

711
00:39:47,018 --> 00:39:49,225
Ifs way more fun
worrying about you.

712
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:52,694
Make him grovel
just a little bit, I swear...

713
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:54,259
Hey!
Hey!

714
00:39:55,093 --> 00:39:56,367
Um... 

715
00:39:56,594 --> 00:39:58,665
Uh, did I catch you
at a bad time?

716
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:01,074
No, never. They're
beautiful, Garrett.

717
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:03,076
What is?
The flowers!

718
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:04,840
Flowers? What flowers?

719
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,912
Claire? Hello?

720
00:40:09,007 --> 00:40:10,850
You know what, I'm going
to call you back.

721
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:42,211
I need to talk to you.

722
00:40:44,409 --> 00:40:46,980
I'm busy with
physical education.

723
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,250
I believe you're familiar
with that subject, right?

724
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:50,651
Noah!

725
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:56,661
Those flowers?
What were you thinking?

726
00:40:57,055 --> 00:40:58,227
They were
a peace offering.

727
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:01,134
Do you know what
that looks like?

728
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,135
A student sending
a teacher flowers?

729
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:04,570
That's why I didn't
sign the card.

730
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,075
And you hacked my email?

731
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:09,142
You said I could be
in your class.

732
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:11,406
And you're trying to turn
Kevin against his father!

733
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,948
You can't blame me

734
00:41:13,004 --> 00:41:15,280
for the trouble your cheating
ex-husband has brought upon himself.

735
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,614
Stop it!

736
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:20,654
You're welcome, by the way.
For saving your son'?

737
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,920
Thank you.

738
00:41:27,085 --> 00:41:28,621
You know what,
you're right,

739
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:29,858
I should have thanked you.

740
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:32,628
Everything okay,
Claire?

741
00:41:32,757 --> 00:41:33,997
Yes, Mike.

742
00:41:34,092 --> 00:41:35,662
Everything's fine.
Thanks.

743
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:41,605
Look, I just want us
to start over, Noah, okay?

744
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:43,009
Can we do that, please?

745
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:48,112
Yeah. I can if you can.

746
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:51,352
So, deal?

747
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:53,485
You can trust me, Claire.

748
00:41:54,145 --> 00:41:55,146
Okay?

749
00:41:57,215 --> 00:41:58,956
Okay.

750
00:42:13,064 --> 00:42:15,044
Allie'! Hey.

751
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,543
Hi, Kev.
Need something?

752
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:21,708
Yeah, um, I need four three-eighth
hex head bolts, nuts and washers.

753
00:42:21,806 --> 00:42:25,185
And I need an air filter
for a 201 <i>2 Silverado Z71.

754
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:27,152
And I need you to go
to a movie with me.

755
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,222
I'm kind of busy with work.

756
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:32,521
And now that school's started...
Um...

757
00:42:33,184 --> 00:42:34,561
Okay.

758
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:36,487
Um...

759
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:38,328
Well, I guess
I'll see you around, then.

760
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:40,832
But I don't have
a date to the Fall Fling.

761
00:42:44,662 --> 00:42:46,266
Uh, me neither.

762
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:49,336
That's! be really great.

763
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,347
Like, really, really, um...

764
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,742
Great?

765
00:42:53,838 --> 00:42:55,215
Yeah, great.

766
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:56,712
Great.

767
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:59,013
Okay. Well, um,
I'll see you around.

768
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:00,556
Okay, cool.
Okay.

769
00:43:20,465 --> 00:43:22,467
I think I like
the first one better.

770
00:43:22,567 --> 00:43:23,944
You do?
Yeah.

771
00:43:24,035 --> 00:43:28,040
Then the soldier says, "No, no,
buddy, she didn't have a head."

772
00:43:30,475 --> 00:43:31,954
Oh, God.
It's stupid.

773
00:43:32,043 --> 00:43:33,954
It is stupid.

774
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:49,964
I'm not ready.

775
00:43:50,061 --> 00:43:51,131
What?

776
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:53,803
There's someone else?

777
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:56,605
No! But we were apart.

778
00:43:56,734 --> 00:43:58,680
Hey, no, no. I don't wanna know.
Look, it was nothing.

779
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:01,079
It just made me
realize how lost I was.

780
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:03,244
Me too, Claire.
We gotta...

781
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:04,843
Listen, we gotta
have a clean slate.

782
00:44:04,942 --> 00:44:06,012
Okay.

783
00:44:06,844 --> 00:44:09,017
But until I get
my head straight,

784
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:11,593
I'm not ready to
just jump back in,

785
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,595
and I need you
to know that.

786
00:44:15,286 --> 00:44:16,594
All right.

787
00:44:17,088 --> 00:44:18,533
All right.

788
00:44:18,689 --> 00:44:21,169
It's honest. Okay?

789
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:23,535
No guarantees, I get it.

790
00:44:23,628 --> 00:44:25,005
Okay.

791
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:28,337
Um...

792
00:44:29,367 --> 00:44:31,711
I think I had one too many.

793
00:44:32,537 --> 00:44:34,380
Can I crash on the couch?

794
00:44:36,307 --> 00:44:38,480
Okay.

795
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:54,396
I just want you to know,
I'm not giving up on us.

796
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:59,030
Well, I want you know
that I'm not asking you to.

797
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:09,939
Kevin! Let's go!

798
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:19,477
What a fucking whore
you are!

799
00:46:19,577 --> 00:46:20,817
"Deal," you said.
"Let's make a deal."

800
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:22,288
You trying to
play me, Claire?

801
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:23,825
Is that what this is?
Of course not.

802
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:25,052
Bullshit!

803
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:26,151
What?

804
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:28,093
Why are you doing this? Because
you're a fucking liar!

805
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:29,130
What is wrong with you?

806
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:30,221
I'm seeing things
clearly now.

807
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:32,962
You have to stop! Hey,
Noah, what's going on?

808
00:46:33,824 --> 00:46:35,394
Game on.

809
00:46:36,127 --> 00:46:37,572
Mom, what just happened?

810
00:46:37,662 --> 00:46:39,437
Honey, I need you to stay
away from Noah, okay?

811
00:46:39,497 --> 00:46:40,999
He's a bad influence.

812
00:46:41,098 --> 00:46:42,236
What are you talking about?

813
00:46:42,667 --> 00:46:44,305
You're just going to have
to trust me on this one.

814
00:46:44,402 --> 00:46:46,507
No, I'm not going
to trust you! Okay.

815
00:46:46,604 --> 00:46:48,413
'Cause you're not taking away
the one good friend I have.

816
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:49,780
He is not your friend!

817
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,513
Bullshit!
Mom, he's my friend!

818
00:46:51,609 --> 00:46:54,180
Excuse me? Watch your
mouth and get in the car!

819
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:56,155
You know, he said you'd do this.
What?

820
00:46:56,247 --> 00:46:57,487
He said you'd do this,
and if you did,

821
00:46:57,581 --> 00:46:58,821
then it was Dad
talking and not you.

822
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:00,623
He's been right all along!
This is crazy!

823
00:47:00,685 --> 00:47:02,528
Noah, wait!

824
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:05,601
Kevin! I'm asking you
to get in the car.

825
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:09,862
See you at school.

826
00:47:14,765 --> 00:47:16,176
Hey! Whoa!

827
00:47:16,267 --> 00:47:17,940
Excuse me.
Hello.

828
00:47:18,536 --> 00:47:20,447
Move! Move!

829
00:47:33,951 --> 00:47:34,952
Hey, Peterson!

830
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:38,456
Your movie was on Turner
Classics last night.

831
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,365
The Wiz.

832
00:47:41,225 --> 00:47:43,796
It's like the black version
of The Wizard of Oz.

833
00:47:45,129 --> 00:47:47,405
The Wizards of Waverly Place
are on tomorrow.

834
00:47:47,498 --> 00:47:48,499
Fuck you, Zimmer!

835
00:47:48,566 --> 00:47:49,977
Want some of this?
Yeah, fuck you!

836
00:47:57,575 --> 00:48:00,385
Stop it! Noah, stop it! Stop it!

837
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,046
Get off!

838
00:48:04,982 --> 00:48:06,723
Get up! Get the fuck up!

839
00:48:09,487 --> 00:48:10,488
Noah, stop!

840
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:14,927
Fuck you!

841
00:48:17,261 --> 00:48:18,672
So, I was looking
at your files.

842
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:19,764
Why?

843
00:48:19,864 --> 00:48:22,105
I'm a vice principal.
It's my job.

844
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:23,334
Whatever.

845
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:25,438
So, what a surprise
I found when we didn't

846
00:48:25,536 --> 00:48:27,072
have your transcripts
from your old school,

847
00:48:27,171 --> 00:48:29,447
so I called them.
Know what they told me?

848
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:31,178
To mind your own business?
No!

849
00:48:31,776 --> 00:48:34,120
That you were kicked out
for disorderly conduct.

850
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:37,916
Jason Zimmer's skull is fractured.
You could have killed him!

851
00:48:38,048 --> 00:48:39,083
Okay

852
00:48:39,183 --> 00:48:40,719
I'm not done.
lam.

853
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:43,457
I'm not! Sit down!

854
00:48:43,621 --> 00:48:45,692
I said sit down!

855
00:48:50,227 --> 00:48:51,535
You know what I see?

856
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:55,039
I see a pattern of disturbing behavior.
Poor impulse control.

857
00:48:55,132 --> 00:48:56,304
You know what I see?

858
00:48:57,735 --> 00:48:59,772
A pathetic old woman
who's trying to look

859
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:00,940
and act like
something she's not.

860
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:02,278
Something she'll never be.

861
00:49:03,641 --> 00:49:05,143
Because all she really is

862
00:49:06,577 --> 00:49:11,890
is a dried up,
dirty, fucking cunt.

863
00:49:18,222 --> 00:49:20,168
You're gone'
you're expelled!

864
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:30,169
Kevin, you don't want
to keep her waiting.

865
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:31,575
Come on,
you're going to be late!

866
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,012
Mom, we're going
to get there too early,

867
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:34,605
nobody's even
going to be there.

868
00:49:37,107 --> 00:49:38,347
Okay, how do I look?

869
00:49:41,245 --> 00:49:42,849
Like the handsomest man
on Earth.

870
00:49:42,947 --> 00:49:44,153
Mom, come on,
please, stop.

871
00:49:44,248 --> 00:49:45,192
Seriously, come on,

872
00:49:45,282 --> 00:49:46,352
tonight has gotta be
perfect, all right?

873
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:48,691
Because Allie Callahan's the
most beautiful girl in school

874
00:49:48,786 --> 00:49:50,527
and I just never thought she'd
actually go out with me.

875
00:49:50,621 --> 00:49:51,793
Okay, please, stop.

876
00:49:52,122 --> 00:49:54,796
Well, she obviously knows
quality when she sees it.

877
00:49:55,793 --> 00:49:56,794
Mmm.

878
00:50:01,098 --> 00:50:02,475
She'll love it! Come on!

879
00:50:04,702 --> 00:50:05,874
BOY: Hey!

880
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,323
Hi, Kev.
You look amazing.

881
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,849
Thanks, Allie. Uh, you
look really great, loo.

882
00:50:20,117 --> 00:50:21,221
Thanks.

883
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,022
Uh, this is...
That's for you.

884
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:25,225
Thank you.

885
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:26,993
Mrs. Peterson?
Yes?

886
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:28,636
Um, some of the guys
said there's water

887
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,069
running out of
the boys' bathroom.

888
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,867
Oh, okay. Um...

889
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:34,400
You guys go. Have fun.

890
00:50:34,498 --> 00:50:36,068
Okay

891
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:37,906
I'll check it out.
Okay.

892
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:43,641
So, do you like the flower? Yeah.
I love it, thank you so much.

893
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:48,254
Anybody in there?

894
00:50:50,014 --> 00:50:51,152
Ugh.

895
00:51:17,575 --> 00:51:19,020
We need to talk.

896
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:24,890
Your behavior has been
completely unacceptable.

897
00:51:24,949 --> 00:51:26,087
My behavior?

898
00:51:26,183 --> 00:51:28,129
And I'm not going
to stand for it.

899
00:51:28,953 --> 00:51:30,455
Just let me go.

900
00:51:30,554 --> 00:51:32,591
So, what, your shit-head
husband comes crawling back

901
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:34,363
and you're just
done with me?

902
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:35,870
Suddenly,
I'm nothing to you?

903
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:38,930
Like what we had
never even happened.

904
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:41,475
It was one night, and it was a mistake!
We had nothing!

905
00:51:41,565 --> 00:51:44,910
Hey, hey! Yes, we did.

906
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:50,380
And you loved it.

907
00:51:51,976 --> 00:51:53,080
Just like this.

908
00:51:53,143 --> 00:51:54,213
No.

909
00:51:56,413 --> 00:51:57,448
No.

910
00:51:59,883 --> 00:52:01,624
Just like this.
Don't.

911
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:11,802
You think you can scare me

912
00:52:11,895 --> 00:52:14,000
with some graffiti
on the wall?

913
00:52:14,999 --> 00:52:16,342
Think again!

914
00:52:16,567 --> 00:52:19,013
It's going to be
your word against mine!

915
00:52:19,103 --> 00:52:20,776
And who do you think
they're going to believe?

916
00:52:20,838 --> 00:52:22,818
Stay away from me!

917
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:25,685
And stay away from my son!

918
00:53:33,977 --> 00:53:35,251
Sorry, guys.

919
00:53:35,345 --> 00:53:36,881
Good morning!

920
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:46,326
Um...

921
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:47,867
Give me one second, okay?

922
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:35,748
What's going on?

923
00:54:35,906 --> 00:54:37,579
She locked us out.

924
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:49,727
Mrs. Peterson,
open this door!

925
00:54:55,259 --> 00:54:56,397
Mrs. Peterson!

926
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:02,807
Open this door now!

927
00:55:17,748 --> 00:55:19,659
Mrs. Peterson,
I'm coming in!

928
00:55:33,764 --> 00:55:34,765
Come on in.

929
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:35,867
What the devil's going on?

930
00:55:35,966 --> 00:55:37,036
The bell rang
five minutes ago.

931
00:55:37,134 --> 00:55:38,204
Oh, I'm sorry, Ed.

932
00:55:38,302 --> 00:55:39,372
Take a seat. Come on.

933
00:55:39,469 --> 00:55:41,107
Why was your
door locked, Claire?

934
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,980
Oh, I just had
a personal call.

935
00:55:45,309 --> 00:55:47,380
You guys take
your seat, okay?

936
00:55:47,945 --> 00:55:49,185
All right.

937
00:55:49,279 --> 00:55:51,953
You know what, give Mrs.
Peterson and I a second.

938
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:02,667
I'm concerned, Claire.
Very concerned.

939
00:56:02,726 --> 00:56:05,673
Your behavior lately has
raised a lot of eyebrows.

940
00:56:06,296 --> 00:56:08,037
Mike Avenido
reported an incident

941
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:10,338
in the gym with you
and Noah Sandborn.

942
00:56:10,901 --> 00:56:13,472
Oh. Yeah, I remember that.

943
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:17,208
Thai was when I was reprimanding
him for skipping class.

944
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:19,344
Mike said that you
got physical with him,

945
00:56:19,409 --> 00:56:21,411
that you put
your hands on him.

946
00:56:21,678 --> 00:56:23,487
Now, you know what
our policy is regarding

947
00:56:23,547 --> 00:56:25,254
the use of physical force
on students.

948
00:56:25,349 --> 00:56:27,727
Well, I would hardly say
I was using physical force!

949
00:56:27,818 --> 00:56:31,095
I'm not questioning
your integrity here, okay?

950
00:56:31,188 --> 00:56:33,691
But I'm questioning
your behavior.

951
00:56:34,825 --> 00:56:35,997
Get it together.

952
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:38,032
Please.

953
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:47,842
Hey, Kev!

954
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:55,512
What?

955
00:56:55,579 --> 00:56:57,388
I told your mom
I'd pick you up today.

956
00:56:58,348 --> 00:57:01,591
Because I think it's time for
you to drive this bad boy.

957
00:57:13,764 --> 00:57:15,539
I'm not used to you driving.

958
00:57:15,732 --> 00:57:17,712
Yeah, well,
I've been doing it awhile.

959
00:57:17,868 --> 00:57:18,903
I guess.

960
00:57:21,538 --> 00:57:22,949
Come on, buddy,
slow down.

961
00:57:24,574 --> 00:57:26,110
You like to drive fast,
isn't that right?

962
00:57:26,877 --> 00:57:28,982
I mean, why else
get a car like this?

963
00:57:29,079 --> 00:57:30,422
Unless you're trying
to be something

964
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,925
that you're just
completely not.

965
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:38,096
Kevin, slow down!

966
00:57:38,221 --> 00:57:39,666
Do you have any idea
what that was like

967
00:57:39,756 --> 00:57:40,996
when you were gone?

968
00:57:41,091 --> 00:57:43,628
You didn't
see her, Dad, okay.

969
00:57:43,727 --> 00:57:44,967
She wasn't Mom anymore.

970
00:57:45,062 --> 00:57:47,008
She was just
completely torn apart,

971
00:57:47,097 --> 00:57:48,508
and I had to
sit back and watch

972
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:50,077
and there was nothing
that I could do about it!

973
00:57:53,103 --> 00:57:54,741
Kevin!

974
00:57:54,905 --> 00:57:56,111
Slow this car down!

975
00:57:58,909 --> 00:57:59,910
Oh, no!

976
00:58:01,111 --> 00:58:02,112
Oh.

977
00:58:02,245 --> 00:58:03,747
What's wrong?
What's going on?

978
00:58:03,914 --> 00:58:04,984
It's not braking!

979
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:06,786
Hit the brakes! 
It's not working!

980
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:08,293
Downshift!

981
00:58:08,752 --> 00:58:10,425
Downshift, downshift!

982
00:58:10,754 --> 00:58:12,825
There's no clutch! What do
you mean there's no clutch?

983
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:15,095
Look out!
Here comes a car!

984
00:58:15,258 --> 00:58:16,259
Lookout! Watch out!

985
00:58:17,427 --> 00:58:18,929
Oh, fuck!

986
00:58:19,096 --> 00:58:21,269
Okay. All right, here goes.
Straight, straight.

987
00:58:21,365 --> 00:58:23,777
Here comes another one, Kevin.
Stay right here!

988
00:58:23,934 --> 00:58:25,641
Kevin, look out!
Look out!

989
00:58:27,938 --> 00:58:29,144
Nothing's working, Dad!

990
00:58:30,107 --> 00:58:31,484
GARRETT:
We gotta get off the road!

991
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:33,120
Emergency brake, punch it!

992
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:34,687
Punch it!

993
00:58:36,113 --> 00:58:37,183
Oh, shit!

994
00:58:44,654 --> 00:58:45,962
I'm so sorry!

995
00:58:46,289 --> 00:58:49,361
Are you all right? It's okay.

996
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:52,235
It's okay, son.
It's okay.

997
00:59:21,825 --> 00:59:23,202
Kevin!

998
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:27,931
Garrett'?

999
00:59:28,165 --> 00:59:29,269
Hey, we're in here
watching TV.

1000
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:34,212
What happened to your car?

1001
00:59:34,504 --> 00:59:36,745
Oh, nothing. I had a
little fender bender.

1002
00:59:36,873 --> 00:59:38,181
We're all right.

1003
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:39,580
Yeah.

1004
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:41,416
They look, uh,
fine to me.

1005
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:44,520
Hey, Mrs. Peterson.

1006
00:59:45,348 --> 00:59:46,918
We're watching
the Detroit Grand Prix.

1007
00:59:47,017 --> 00:59:48,189
Come on in
and get a slice.

1008
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:50,864
Yeah, there's
plenty of room.

1009
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:54,569
I gotta unpack
the groceries.

1010
00:59:56,026 --> 00:59:58,028
I'm gonna get something
else to munch on.

1011
01:00:00,464 --> 01:00:01,602
Look at these clowns.

1012
01:00:01,698 --> 01:00:02,938
Do you have any chips?

1013
01:00:03,934 --> 01:00:05,379
You took pictures!

1014
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:07,711
A video, actually.
Capture the moment.

1015
01:00:07,871 --> 01:00:10,112
Come over tonight.

1016
01:00:10,207 --> 01:00:11,982
After they're asleep.
Say, 2:00?

1017
01:00:12,075 --> 01:00:13,645
Go fuck yourself!

1018
01:00:13,743 --> 01:00:15,552
I'd rather fuck you.

1019
01:00:16,413 --> 01:00:18,393
You're fucking crazy!

1020
01:00:19,716 --> 01:00:21,662
Who should I
show it to first?

1021
01:00:21,751 --> 01:00:22,957
Garrett'?

1022
01:00:23,887 --> 01:00:25,628
Or maybe... Kevin!

1023
01:00:25,722 --> 01:00:27,224
No!
Yeah?

1024
01:00:28,592 --> 01:00:29,798
Do you want a soda?

1025
01:00:30,427 --> 01:00:32,134
That sounds good.
Thanks!

1026
01:00:32,229 --> 01:00:33,731
Hey, I'll take another
cold one, please!

1027
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:35,401
Yeah, anything
for you, Garrett.

1028
01:00:38,768 --> 01:00:40,270
I'll leave the light on.

1029
01:00:51,781 --> 01:00:52,919
Noah?

1030
01:01:01,258 --> 01:01:02,794
Hey, you're early.

1031
01:01:03,026 --> 01:01:04,198
Where's the damn video?

1032
01:01:04,928 --> 01:01:06,271
Why are you so angry?

1033
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:08,002
What you did in my
classroom today?

1034
01:01:08,098 --> 01:01:09,475
You've been avoiding me.

1035
01:01:09,533 --> 01:01:11,774
What do you think? This is some
kind of game we're playing here?

1036
01:01:11,968 --> 01:01:13,276
This is real life!

1037
01:01:13,837 --> 01:01:15,441
That is my home!

1038
01:01:15,605 --> 01:01:16,948
Okay. You're doing things
in front of my kid,

1039
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:18,315
in front of my husband?

1040
01:01:19,609 --> 01:01:22,351
Your husband. Your fucking
cheating, lying husband?

1041
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:25,959
Okay. What's your plan?

1042
01:01:26,616 --> 01:01:28,357
What do you think? What do you
think, we're going to date?

1043
01:01:29,319 --> 01:01:31,890
We're going to go on
family vacations together?

1044
01:01:31,988 --> 01:01:34,662
What do you think
is going to happen here?

1045
01:01:34,724 --> 01:01:37,068
Here? Nothing.

1046
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,367
But it's a big world
out there, Claire.

1047
01:01:39,462 --> 01:01:40,805
Oh, my God, this is crazy!

1048
01:01:40,864 --> 01:01:42,502
No, no, no,
wait, wait, wait!

1049
01:01:43,967 --> 01:01:44,968
Wait.

1050
01:01:50,874 --> 01:01:55,323
You see that video,
and the proof of our love

1051
01:01:56,313 --> 01:02:00,819
as a threat to this life,
but I see it as a promise.

1052
01:02:00,884 --> 01:02:02,886
For a better one.

1053
01:02:02,986 --> 01:02:06,160
And none of this will
ever see the light of day.

1054
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:17,837
If you let me show you
what's possible.

1055
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:22,876
Because, Claire,

1056
01:02:24,341 --> 01:02:26,844
I will never

1057
01:02:27,010 --> 01:02:29,513
ever gonna let you go.

1058
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:36,859
Fucking crazy!

1059
01:02:54,871 --> 01:02:56,782
Oh, Claire.

1060
01:02:57,707 --> 01:03:00,085
Okay,
why didn't you tell me?

1061
01:03:01,578 --> 01:03:04,081
I thought that
I could handle it.

1062
01:03:04,147 --> 01:03:06,718
I thought that it was gonna
just blow over, I don't know.

1063
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:08,888
I didn't think he was going
to turn into a stalker!

1064
01:03:08,985 --> 01:03:11,795
Okay, okay. Look, we can look
at this picture and we see,

1065
01:03:11,888 --> 01:03:14,300
we know that
he's a psychopath,

1066
01:03:14,391 --> 01:03:16,803
but it's not the way the rest
of the world's going to see it.

1067
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,233
And there's a video.

1068
01:03:21,898 --> 01:03:22,899
What?

1069
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:25,446
There's a video,
and if it gets out,

1070
01:03:26,269 --> 01:03:28,249
you know I'm going to
lose my son,

1071
01:03:28,305 --> 01:03:32,253
my husband,
my job, my life.

1072
01:03:32,342 --> 01:03:34,652
Everything that I've ever worked for.
Okay, Claire, listen to me.

1073
01:03:34,778 --> 01:03:37,088
Claire, that's not going to happen.
Do you know why?

1074
01:03:37,414 --> 01:03:39,917
I'm not gonna let that
happen, and neither are you.

1075
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:42,753
No one is going
to see that video.

1076
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:44,821
It won't see
the light of day.

1077
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:16,121
What?
Claire, he saw me.

1078
01:05:16,212 --> 01:05:18,283
Get the hell out of there,
he's coming back there!

1079
01:05:18,381 --> 01:05:20,793
Wait. I haven't even found
the video or the files yet.

1080
01:05:20,884 --> 01:05:23,728
Get the hell out of there,
you got five minutes max!

1081
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:05,517
Mrs. Peterson!
Mr. Sand born!

1082
01:08:05,682 --> 01:08:08,526
You scared the living daylights
out of me. I'm sorry.

1083
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:10,856
What in the world
are you doing here?

1084
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:12,260
Sorry.

1085
01:08:15,391 --> 01:08:16,734
Tell me that you're home,

1086
01:08:16,793 --> 01:08:17,931
and that all the doors
are locked.

1087
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:19,368
Yes.

1088
01:08:19,462 --> 01:08:22,932
And I found the computer
and I deleted all the files.

1089
01:08:23,032 --> 01:08:24,705
Good. Good.

1090
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:26,872
But I found something else
even creepier.

1091
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:29,109
I'm not surprised.
He's a freak!

1092
01:08:29,205 --> 01:08:31,583
Does Ethan know any cops
in San Bernardino?

1093
01:08:31,641 --> 01:08:32,949
Oh, I'm sure he does.

1094
01:08:33,042 --> 01:08:34,316
If we're not having
dinner with his mother,

1095
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:35,821
we 're having dinner
with cops.

1096
01:08:35,912 --> 01:08:37,050
Why?

1097
01:08:37,547 --> 01:08:39,049
Just a hunch.

1098
01:08:40,216 --> 01:08:42,457
I might have to go
there later. I'll call him.

1099
01:08:42,552 --> 01:08:44,088
He went to Laughlin
with his mother

1100
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:45,961
for her birthday.
Welcome to my world.

1101
01:08:46,055 --> 01:08:47,398
But listen...

1102
01:08:48,224 --> 01:08:49,635
What?
He's here!

1103
01:08:49,726 --> 01:08:50,966
Get out of there! Run!

1104
01:08:52,061 --> 01:08:53,404
Claire! Claire!

1105
01:08:54,063 --> 01:08:55,064
I'm gonna call the cops!

1106
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:59,079
Talk to me, Claire! I'm dying!
He's trying to force the lock.

1107
01:08:59,235 --> 01:09:00,236
What?

1108
01:09:00,403 --> 01:09:01,939
Oh, God!

1109
01:09:03,573 --> 01:09:04,779
Run, hide!

1110
01:09:09,012 --> 01:09:10,923
Hey, Mom,
what's with the knife?

1111
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:12,150
It's Kevin.

1112
01:09:12,415 --> 01:09:13,416
Oh, my God!

1113
01:09:13,583 --> 01:09:14,618
Oh.
I'm going crazy.

1114
01:09:14,784 --> 01:09:18,027
You guys have to spend the
night with me, out here, okay?

1115
01:09:18,121 --> 01:09:19,998
Oh, God.
I love you very much.

1116
01:09:20,323 --> 01:09:22,098
I'll talk to you later.

1117
01:09:35,338 --> 01:09:37,682
Ethan, uh, said you wanted to
take a look at the Sandborn case.

1118
01:09:37,774 --> 01:09:38,809
Yes.

1119
01:09:38,875 --> 01:09:40,149
Sad. I remember it.

1120
01:09:41,110 --> 01:09:44,114
They were on a back road
outside San Bernardino.

1121
01:09:44,947 --> 01:09:47,894
Tire marks indicated the driver
had lost control of the car.

1122
01:10:00,496 --> 01:10:02,635
The crash killed both
passengers instantly.

1123
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:04,542
And it was ruled
an accident?

1124
01:10:04,634 --> 01:10:06,545
Bodies were destroyed,
so there was no toxicology.

1125
01:10:06,636 --> 01:10:08,513
But we assumed
the driver was drunk.

1126
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:10,241
Why was that?

1127
01:10:10,473 --> 01:10:12,544
Well, he had
a long history of DUl's.

1128
01:10:12,709 --> 01:10:16,316
Or his brakes went out. I mean,
they could have been tampered with.

1129
01:10:16,479 --> 01:10:19,323
Well, Mrs. Peterson,
even if his brakes went out,

1130
01:10:19,382 --> 01:10:21,760
there was no indication
of malfeasance.

1131
01:10:21,851 --> 01:10:23,831
Sometimes,
breaks malfunction.

1132
01:10:23,986 --> 01:10:26,159
Sometimes, people drive
while intoxicated.

1133
01:10:26,322 --> 01:10:27,596
This is the Sandborn car.

1134
01:10:35,164 --> 01:10:36,871
If you don't need
anything else...

1135
01:10:38,668 --> 01:10:41,171
One more question,
Detective. Um...

1136
01:10:43,206 --> 01:10:45,516
Was this a 2006 minivan?

1137
01:10:45,675 --> 01:10:49,179
Well, yeah.
That's exactly what it is.

1138
01:10:49,345 --> 01:10:52,918
Is there something else I
need to know, Mrs. Peterson?

1139
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:57,090
No.

1140
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:01,864
Thank you.

1141
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:20,215
Hey, Noah.
Are you home?

1142
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:21,380
Yeah, what's up?

1143
01:11:21,444 --> 01:11:22,787
You got plans tonight?

1144
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:24,950
Well, I'm supposed to go
to that car show with my dad.

1145
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:26,890
Well, I'm over here
working on Vicky's tractor.

1146
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:28,053
You're at Vicky's?

1147
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:29,892
Yeah, I'm at her ranch.
You know where it's at?

1148
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:32,057
Yeah, no, I think
I know where that is.

1149
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:33,225
Is everything all right?

1150
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:35,166
Can you and your dad swing by
and give me a hand?

1151
01:11:35,258 --> 01:11:36,566
Yeah, okay. Let me ask.

1152
01:11:36,626 --> 01:11:37,832
Just get over here.

1153
01:11:37,927 --> 01:11:39,770
Okay, catch you later. Bye.

1154
01:11:43,666 --> 01:11:46,078
Let me just start off
by saying I'm sorry.

1155
01:11:46,936 --> 01:11:50,907
No, really, lam very,

1156
01:11:51,841 --> 01:11:54,685
very sorry,
Vice Principal Lansing.

1157
01:11:55,812 --> 01:11:58,986
See,
I've got a bit of a temper.

1158
01:11:59,615 --> 01:12:01,322
There's no denying that

1159
01:12:02,752 --> 01:12:04,629
And sometimes,

1160
01:12:04,954 --> 01:12:06,831
it gets the best of me.

1161
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:10,437
Like, when I feel
like I'm being bullied.

1162
01:12:10,793 --> 01:12:13,171
And no one likes
to be bullied, Vicky.

1163
01:12:13,863 --> 01:12:15,706
Can I call you Vicky?

1164
01:12:16,432 --> 01:12:18,378
I mean, given that
I'm in your house,

1165
01:12:18,467 --> 01:12:20,105
and it's after hours,

1166
01:12:20,703 --> 01:12:22,705
calling you Vice Principal
just feels,

1167
01:12:23,139 --> 01:12:26,120
I don't know, wrong.

1168
01:12:30,546 --> 01:12:32,617
See, my guess, Vicky,

1169
01:12:32,882 --> 01:12:35,829
is that, uh, you don't
like to be bullied.

1170
01:12:36,519 --> 01:12:38,362
I mean, who would?

1171
01:12:40,456 --> 01:12:42,732
But that's what you were
doing to me today.

1172
01:12:44,293 --> 01:12:45,795
You and Claire.

1173
01:12:46,128 --> 01:12:47,402
Now, the two of you,

1174
01:12:47,864 --> 01:12:50,868
with your little secrets.

1175
01:12:52,902 --> 01:12:54,575
You were playing a joke.

1176
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:56,980
A silly little game.

1177
01:12:57,673 --> 01:13:00,517
Trying to make me think
that you were her'

1178
01:13:02,178 --> 01:13:04,385
so she could do what?

1179
01:13:09,685 --> 01:13:11,858
Something sneaky?

1180
01:13:13,356 --> 01:13:15,358
Something...

1181
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:19,703
She's hiding from me?

1182
01:13:20,563 --> 01:13:22,201
What was it, Vicky?

1183
01:13:27,169 --> 01:13:28,512
No, no, no.

1184
01:13:29,538 --> 01:13:30,949
Let me.

1185
01:13:35,011 --> 01:13:36,081
Vicky!

1186
01:13:36,178 --> 01:13:38,124
Listen, lam pretty sure

1187
01:13:38,214 --> 01:13:40,854
that Noah tampered with the
brakes on his parents' car

1188
01:13:40,917 --> 01:13:42,191
and that's why they crashed.

1189
01:13:43,019 --> 01:13:45,693
And I'm pretty sure he did
the same thing to Garrett's.

1190
01:13:45,755 --> 01:13:48,099
Claire, <i>I need you.

1191
01:13:48,190 --> 01:13:50,466
I need to talk.
Can you come over?

1192
01:14:46,449 --> 01:14:49,521
Vicky! Are you upstairs?

1193
01:15:02,298 --> 01:15:03,504
Vicky?

1194
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:11,875
Vicky.

1195
01:15:32,795 --> 01:15:34,297
on, my God!

1196
01:15:38,501 --> 01:15:41,004
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1197
01:16:02,324 --> 01:16:03,826
911. What's your emergency?

1198
01:16:04,026 --> 01:16:05,664
Out!

1199
01:16:06,429 --> 01:16:08,670
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1200
01:16:12,701 --> 01:16:14,112
You killed Vicky!

1201
01:16:14,203 --> 01:16:17,514
For you. For you, okay? She
wasn't your friend, Claire!

1202
01:16:17,673 --> 01:16:19,243
Hey, hey, hey!

1203
01:16:19,708 --> 01:16:22,188
When I love somebody,
I protect them.

1204
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:24,224
That's what heroes do.

1205
01:16:24,513 --> 01:16:27,255
No heroes kill their
mothers and fathers!

1206
01:16:27,550 --> 01:16:31,760
I would never ever
hurt my mother.

1207
01:16:32,188 --> 01:16:33,895
I loved my mother,

1208
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:35,535
but she killed herself.

1209
01:16:38,461 --> 01:16:41,203
My cheating father
and his whore

1210
01:16:41,363 --> 01:16:42,808
got what they deserved.

1211
01:16:42,898 --> 01:16:44,036
But, hey.

1212
01:16:45,034 --> 01:16:47,446
I protect people I love.

1213
01:16:47,536 --> 01:16:49,914
This is all for you.

1214
01:16:49,972 --> 01:16:51,144
Okay?

1215
01:16:53,876 --> 01:16:54,877
No!

1216
01:16:56,912 --> 01:16:58,448
Now, let's go.

1217
01:17:13,596 --> 01:17:14,666
Garrett!

1218
01:17:15,798 --> 01:17:16,902
Garrett!

1219
01:17:19,168 --> 01:17:21,842
Oh, my God!
What did you do to him?

1220
01:17:22,271 --> 01:17:25,150
Well, he ran into
a 14-inch crescent wrench.

1221
01:17:25,341 --> 01:17:26,479
Mom!

1222
01:17:27,143 --> 01:17:28,281
Kevin!

1223
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:31,416
Noah, you hurt my mom,
I swear to God...

1224
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:32,481
Really, Kevin?

1225
01:17:32,581 --> 01:17:34,288
I would never
hurt your mother.

1226
01:17:35,451 --> 01:17:36,452
I love your mother.

1227
01:17:36,919 --> 01:17:38,921
Just steady your breathing, baby!

1228
01:17:39,421 --> 01:17:41,264
And honestly,
I'd hoped you'd see me

1229
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:43,030
as a mentor
who cared about you

1230
01:17:43,125 --> 01:17:47,505
more than your
cheating father ever did.

1231
01:17:48,797 --> 01:17:49,969
Tell him, Claire.

1232
01:17:50,132 --> 01:17:51,167
Do you need your shot?

1233
01:17:51,267 --> 01:17:52,439
Mom.

1234
01:17:52,701 --> 01:17:54,647
You know,
it's destiny, Claire.

1235
01:17:54,703 --> 01:17:56,444
And you can't
interfere with destiny.

1236
01:17:56,772 --> 01:17:57,842
Mom.

1237
01:18:05,281 --> 01:18:07,158
We're meant to be.

1238
01:18:07,283 --> 01:18:08,819
And Garrett

1239
01:18:10,619 --> 01:18:12,121
needs to know that

1240
01:18:12,188 --> 01:18:14,327
Wake up! Hey, wake up!

1241
01:18:22,164 --> 01:18:23,336
It's gonna be okay.

1242
01:18:24,667 --> 01:18:26,840
You know, I was going
to take Kevin with us.

1243
01:18:28,404 --> 01:18:31,078
Seems like he's got too
much of his father in him.

1244
01:18:31,173 --> 01:18:32,311
No, he needs to go.

1245
01:18:32,675 --> 01:18:33,813
No! No, no, no.

1246
01:18:35,511 --> 01:18:37,149
No, he's not like
his father at all.

1247
01:18:39,848 --> 01:18:42,829
Noah' you've taught him.
You've changed him.

1248
01:18:49,858 --> 01:18:51,235
All right.

1249
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:52,868
All right, then, uh...

1250
01:18:53,996 --> 01:18:56,033
He'll come with us.
Yes.

1251
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,673
Form our own family.

1252
01:19:14,183 --> 01:19:15,184
Mom! Mom!

1253
01:19:32,568 --> 01:19:33,706
Please, Noah!

1254
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:35,612
Please, just stop this!
Let me help you.

1255
01:19:35,704 --> 01:19:37,274
There's still time.

1256
01:19:37,373 --> 01:19:40,411
There's no time.
This is our time!

1257
01:19:40,476 --> 01:19:42,547
You'll never be lovelier
than you are right now!

1258
01:19:42,945 --> 01:19:45,926
We will never be here again!

1259
01:20:05,234 --> 01:20:06,235
What are you doing?

1260
01:20:06,602 --> 01:20:09,310
Building a funeral pyre.
What does it look like?

1261
01:20:12,908 --> 01:20:14,410
You can't do this!

1262
01:20:14,943 --> 01:20:16,251
No!
Stop!

1263
01:20:19,481 --> 01:20:20,789
I'm sick and tired
of everyone

1264
01:20:20,849 --> 01:20:22,658
going back and forth!

1265
01:20:22,751 --> 01:20:24,355
So, it's time to
make a choice, my love!

1266
01:20:25,087 --> 01:20:28,091
You either live with me
or you die with them.

1267
01:20:28,157 --> 01:20:30,137
No! No!

1268
01:20:58,821 --> 01:21:00,300
Take Kev
and get out of here!

1269
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:06,837
No! No!

1270
01:21:08,564 --> 01:21:11,135
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1271
01:21:12,468 --> 01:21:15,005
Oh, my God!
Stay with me, Garrett!

1272
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:18,375
Garrett, stay with me!
Stay with me!

1273
01:21:18,474 --> 01:21:21,148
All right.
Let's go, Claire.

1274
01:21:22,978 --> 01:21:26,721
You'll see.
You and me. Off-grid.

1275
01:21:28,317 --> 01:21:30,354
There is nothing
I wouldn't do for you.

1276
01:21:35,824 --> 01:21:37,667
You can trust me.

1277
01:21:38,427 --> 01:21:39,428
But, Noah,

1278
01:21:40,562 --> 01:21:41,734
you can't trust me!

1279
01:22:01,049 --> 01:22:03,188
Die, you piece of fucking shit!
No!

1280
01:22:24,907 --> 01:22:25,908
Ahhh!

1281
01:22:54,570 --> 01:22:58,313
Sorry, buddy,
but sometimes even heroes

1282
01:22:58,407 --> 01:22:59,750
have to make tough choices.

1283
01:22:59,808 --> 01:23:00,809
Noah!

1284
01:23:02,077 --> 01:23:03,750
Noah! Noah!

1285
01:23:05,581 --> 01:23:07,083
You're no hero!

1286
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:40,851
I'm here.
I'm right here.

1287
01:23:42,784 --> 01:23:44,627
All right, guys, lift on three.
One, two, three.

1288
01:23:44,786 --> 01:23:46,959
Me and Kevin
are right here, sweetie.

1289
01:23:54,129 --> 01:23:55,631
We got him now, ma'am.

1290
01:23:55,697 --> 01:23:57,734
Don't you worry.
He's gonna be fine.

1291
01:23:57,833 --> 01:24:00,837
Just hang in there.
Hang in there.

1292
01:24:02,137 --> 01:24:03,343
You're gonna be okay.

1293
01:24:06,475 --> 01:24:08,148
You're going to be okay.

1294
01:24:09,645 --> 01:24:11,522
And then we're
gonna go home.

1295
01:24:14,249 --> 01:24:16,229
You hear me?
We're going home.
