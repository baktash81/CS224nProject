1
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:01,402
What kind of pies
do you have?

2
00:01:01,445 --> 00:01:02,737
Well, we got um...

3
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,159
Apple, pecan, cherry, key lime.

4
00:01:07,241 --> 00:01:09,118
And which do you recommend?

5
00:01:09,201 --> 00:01:11,829
Well, key lime's great, but...

6
00:01:11,913 --> 00:01:13,748
it's an acquired...
acquired taste.

7
00:01:13,832 --> 00:01:16,751
Well I ain't had
key lime pie in ten years.

8
00:01:16,792 --> 00:01:19,379
When you had it did you like it?

9
00:01:19,462 --> 00:01:20,963
No, but that don't mean much.

10
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:23,340
I was a completely
different person back then.

11
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:26,761
Let's give that key lime pie
a day in court...

12
00:01:26,803 --> 00:01:31,140
And a big ol' glass
of nonfat milk, if you please.

13
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:33,477
Should I make that two pieces?

14
00:01:33,559 --> 00:01:35,936
No, no, Rosie.

15
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:40,900
My name's not Rosie.
It's Mabel!

16
00:01:40,983 --> 00:01:42,985
Whatever.

17
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:45,946
"It must have hurt your pride"

18
00:01:49,658 --> 00:01:54,246
"To have to stand
beneath my window"

19
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:57,542
"With your bugle and your drum"

20
00:02:00,379 --> 00:02:04,256
"And me, I'm up there waitin'

21
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,427
"For the miracle"

22
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:10,596
"For the miracle to come"

23
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:22,650
"I don't believe you'd like it"

24
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,195
"You wouldn't like it here"

25
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,913
"There ain't no entertainment"

26
00:02:34,995 --> 00:02:38,749
"And the judgments are severe"

27
00:02:42,086 --> 00:02:45,047
Goddamn, this son-of-a-bitch
is runnin' hot!

28
00:02:45,089 --> 00:02:48,092
Y'all go on inside.
I'm gonna check it out.

29
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:49,428
All right, I'll get a
cold one for ya.

30
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:57,351
Good God almighty,
what the hell is that?

31
00:03:02,566 --> 00:03:05,610
That?
A bitch out of hell, son.

32
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:07,445
Take a run at her, kiddo.

33
00:03:11,032 --> 00:03:13,618
- Miller, Mabel.
- Right, comin' up.

34
00:03:13,701 --> 00:03:14,827
Hey, Mabel.

35
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:20,249
"The way you love me
got to suit my style"

36
00:03:20,332 --> 00:03:22,543
"Or little baby,
I will say goodbye"

37
00:03:22,626 --> 00:03:25,588
That's some sweet
piece of meat, ain't it?

38
00:03:25,671 --> 00:03:26,839
Her name's...

39
00:03:29,216 --> 00:03:30,385
...Mallory.

40
00:03:30,468 --> 00:03:32,053
Mallory, whatever.
Who gives a shit?

41
00:03:32,137 --> 00:03:34,138
I call it pussy!

42
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,700
Hell's bells,
don't stop now, darlin'...

43
00:03:54,785 --> 00:03:56,703
I'm just gettin' started!

44
00:03:56,786 --> 00:03:59,246
Hey, I think
she's sweet on you.

45
00:04:01,957 --> 00:04:06,128
Are you flirtin' with me?

46
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:07,838
Beep, beep.

47
00:04:15,846 --> 00:04:18,933
You want a piece of it, darling?!

48
00:04:18,974 --> 00:04:21,352
Your move, fucker!
Go!

49
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:33,572
Yeah!
This stupid...

50
00:04:38,703 --> 00:04:41,080
Shit...

51
00:04:41,164 --> 00:04:42,666
...list!

52
00:04:45,668 --> 00:04:48,629
Shit!
You son-of-a-bitch...

53
00:04:48,713 --> 00:04:50,172
It's not polite to point.

54
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:00,182
Just because my woman's
mopping up the floor...

55
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:02,977
...with your buddy,
is no reason to join in.

56
00:05:15,698 --> 00:05:19,577
How sexy am I now?
Huh... flirty boy?!

57
00:05:19,661 --> 00:05:21,580
How sexy am I now?!

58
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,304
Damn!

59
00:05:38,388 --> 00:05:42,224
"You made my shit list!"

60
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,395
Why're they always
fuckin' with me?

61
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,646
Honey!
Come on, he's dead.

62
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:50,649
I just wanna dance.
Fucker!

63
00:05:55,739 --> 00:05:59,117
No!
There's no escaping here!

64
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:02,328
Who's the lucky one?

65
00:06:02,371 --> 00:06:04,830
Eenie, meenie...
minie, moe...

66
00:06:04,914 --> 00:06:07,583
Catch a redneck
by his toe.

67
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:11,003
If he hollers
let him go!

68
00:06:11,087 --> 00:06:13,923
Eanie, meanie, minie, moe...

69
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:17,260
My mama told me...

70
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:20,388
...to pick the best one,

71
00:06:20,471 --> 00:06:23,849
...and you are it!

72
00:06:34,236 --> 00:06:35,861
Woo!

73
00:06:38,155 --> 00:06:40,158
When people ask you
who done this,

74
00:06:40,241 --> 00:06:42,952
you tell 'em
Mickey and Mallory Knox did it.

75
00:06:42,994 --> 00:06:44,120
All right?
Say it!

76
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:47,374
Mickey and Mallory Knox did it.

77
00:06:47,456 --> 00:06:49,959
Mickey and Mallory Knox.

78
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,503
I love you, Mickey.

79
00:06:52,586 --> 00:06:54,631
I love you, Mallory!

80
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:32,877
Stars are coming out.

81
00:07:32,961 --> 00:07:35,963
Look up in the brassy sky...

82
00:07:36,048 --> 00:07:38,675
and there they are
like loony pocket change.

83
00:07:38,717 --> 00:07:41,260
You bet on something you wish
you had 10,000 to bet on,

84
00:07:41,344 --> 00:07:43,429
something where the odds are good.

85
00:07:43,512 --> 00:07:47,016
Betting all those stars
won't mean shit...

86
00:08:22,885 --> 00:08:25,930
I saw 'em getting out of the car,
...going into a door.

87
00:08:26,014 --> 00:08:30,267
One of the cops looks at me,
and I say, "No!"

88
00:09:14,895 --> 00:09:17,148
The whole world's
comin' to an end, Mal.

89
00:09:20,568 --> 00:09:24,572
That's the angels, Mickey.

90
00:09:24,655 --> 00:09:27,366
They're comin' down for us
from heaven.

91
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:32,413
And I see you ridin'
a big red horse.

92
00:09:32,496 --> 00:09:35,458
And you're drivin' the horses,
whippin' 'em.

93
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:38,335
And they're spittin' and frothin'
all at the mouth.

94
00:09:39,588 --> 00:09:41,589
And they're comin' right at us.

95
00:09:43,633 --> 00:09:46,303
And I see the future.

96
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:48,013
There's no death,

97
00:09:48,095 --> 00:09:50,598
'cause you and I,
we're angels.

98
00:09:57,772 --> 00:09:59,899
That is poetry.

99
00:10:03,778 --> 00:10:05,571
I love you, Mal.

100
00:10:06,947 --> 00:10:09,492
I know you do, baby.

101
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:12,536
I've loved you
since the day we met.

102
00:10:21,212 --> 00:10:22,838
Hi, Dad,
how was work?

103
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:25,175
What work?
I'm unemployed.

104
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:27,760
Where the
have you been, huh?

105
00:10:27,844 --> 00:10:29,720
Well, you look nice, Mallory.

106
00:10:29,804 --> 00:10:33,641
Yuck, you look like

107
00:10:33,724 --> 00:10:36,352
Thanks, Mom.
Well, I'm gonna go now.

108
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:39,355
I'll be back at midnight, okay?

109
00:10:39,397 --> 00:10:42,066
What're you wearing,
a broomstick and a trash bag?

110
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:44,277
Why don't you put
some meat on you?

111
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,570
A few pounds lighter,
you'll be Miss Ethiopia.

112
00:10:46,654 --> 00:10:49,032
Where the hell
do you think you're goin'?

113
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:52,077
I'm going to the
John Lee Hooker concert with Donna.

114
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:54,162
I told you that yesterday.

115
00:10:54,203 --> 00:10:57,164
First off, you don't tell me anything!
You ask my permission.

116
00:10:57,207 --> 00:10:59,542
Second, you're not going out
in that whorehouse dress.

117
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:02,170
You'll end up peddlin' your ass,
you stupid bitch.

118
00:11:02,253 --> 00:11:04,755
And third,
you're not going out at all.

119
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,090
You didn't mow the yard.

120
00:11:06,174 --> 00:11:08,677
That piece of shit lawn mower
is fucked!

121
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:11,220
That's how you talk
in front of your mother?!

122
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:14,515
You stupid bitch!
You watch your language

123
00:11:14,599 --> 00:11:17,811
or I'll kick the shit out of you...
like I do her.

124
00:11:18,894 --> 00:11:21,064
So if your ass is in this house...

125
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:23,065
...it's my ass.

126
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:26,360
So you move it upstairs
and take a shower.

127
00:11:26,403 --> 00:11:29,030
And you make sure
it's a good shower,

128
00:11:29,113 --> 00:11:32,366
'cause I'm comin' up after
to see how clean you are.

129
00:11:34,036 --> 00:11:35,579
Mommy!

130
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:44,587
Don't you think you were
a little hard on her, Ed?

131
00:11:45,796 --> 00:11:48,632
I'll show her a little tenderness...
after I eat.

132
00:11:51,093 --> 00:11:54,722
When I get up there
she won't see my face for an hour.

133
00:11:54,806 --> 00:11:58,100
Darling, I think you should
speak nicely in front of Kevin.

134
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,603
Don't think.
You're a idiot!

135
00:12:00,644 --> 00:12:03,898
What am I, the bad guy?

136
00:12:03,982 --> 00:12:05,859
Did I ask you to
my friends?

137
00:12:05,941 --> 00:12:08,027
And don't tell me
what to do!

138
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,863
If it wasn't for me,
you'd still be slingin' hash

139
00:12:09,905 --> 00:12:11,864
...in that shithouse
and fuckin' your boss!

140
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:16,410
Oh, that must be Donna!
I'll tell her the bad news.

141
00:12:16,494 --> 00:12:18,455
Don't let your
macaroni get cold, Ed.

142
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:32,594
- Yes?
- Delivery for Ed Wilson.

143
00:12:33,677 --> 00:12:35,513
What on earth is it?

144
00:12:35,597 --> 00:12:38,057
It's beef, lady
50 pounds of beef.

145
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:41,852
Well you wait right here.
I have to have a word with my husband.

146
00:12:50,945 --> 00:12:53,698
Who're you?

147
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,866
Mickey. Who're you?

148
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,160
I'm Mallory.

149
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:00,329
You oughta change
your name to beautiful.

150
00:13:05,501 --> 00:13:08,170
You a big...
meat eater, Mallory?

151
00:13:10,965 --> 00:13:13,176
I could be.

152
00:13:13,218 --> 00:13:16,303
You always dress like that,
or you just...

153
00:13:16,387 --> 00:13:18,348
...waitin' for me?

154
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:22,017
Why would I be dressed like this
for somebody I don't know?

155
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:24,646
Maybe something inside
told you to.

156
00:13:24,729 --> 00:13:27,440
You know, like fate.

157
00:13:27,524 --> 00:13:29,942
You believe in fate, Mallory?

158
00:13:30,026 --> 00:13:31,486
Maybe.

159
00:13:31,569 --> 00:13:33,529
You don't look too happy.

160
00:13:33,571 --> 00:13:36,532
Wanna go for a ride?
Talk about it?

161
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:43,831
Now, Ed, you promised your doctor,
no more meat.

162
00:13:43,874 --> 00:13:45,834
I eat what I want, so what?

163
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:48,502
This food here,
you pray after you eat.

164
00:13:48,586 --> 00:13:51,964
It's just that I don't want you
to clog up your arteries

165
00:13:52,048 --> 00:13:55,259
...and just keel over at the table.

166
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:57,846
Now don't cry!
It turns me off!

167
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:01,808
I haven't cried in 15 years
and you still haven't touched me.

168
00:14:01,891 --> 00:14:03,518
Yeah, how 'bout him?

169
00:14:03,601 --> 00:14:06,312
You were drunk and thought
you were in Mallory's room!

170
00:14:06,396 --> 00:14:08,064
That's why we have Kevin.

171
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:10,524
What?!
You mean Mallory's my mom?!

172
00:14:10,566 --> 00:14:12,152
I'm sending the meat back, Ed.

173
00:14:12,193 --> 00:14:14,528
And I don't care
what you do to me!

174
00:14:14,613 --> 00:14:16,572
You know what I'll do to you...

175
00:14:16,614 --> 00:14:19,159
- Ed, look!
- What does it say?

176
00:14:19,241 --> 00:14:22,996
"Out with the meat man.
Back before dawn. Love, Mallory."

177
00:14:23,037 --> 00:14:24,830
Oh, that stupid bitch.

178
00:14:24,915 --> 00:14:26,374
Ed, they stole your car.

179
00:14:26,457 --> 00:14:28,959
My car?
Oh, that meat man cocksucker!

180
00:14:29,043 --> 00:14:31,253
I broke her in
and he grabbed her.

181
00:14:31,295 --> 00:14:34,215
I'll fix his ass too.
Call the cops! Come on!

182
00:14:46,602 --> 00:14:49,730
Everything I see,
I see you, Mal.

183
00:14:49,814 --> 00:14:53,067
I know, baby,
I'm goin' crazy too.

184
00:14:55,111 --> 00:14:57,405
Even ugliness looks beautiful...
...'cause of you.

185
00:14:57,446 --> 00:15:00,825
Even though I'm in here,
I visit you every night.

186
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,666
Listen, Mickey...

187
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,919
...my daddy,
he's gonna move us away...

188
00:15:12,003 --> 00:15:14,255
so that you
can't never find me.

189
00:15:14,338 --> 00:15:16,174
And I'm scared.

190
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:18,384
He can't keep me away from you.

191
00:15:20,469 --> 00:15:22,763
He said if you ever show up...

192
00:15:22,847 --> 00:15:24,557
...he's gonna kill you.

193
00:15:26,183 --> 00:15:28,936
Kill me?
When's this supposed to happen?

194
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,813
Can I help you?!

195
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:33,983
He won't leave me alone.

196
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:37,611
He keeps fuckin' touchin' me,
and I can't take it.

197
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:40,656
I have to go.

198
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,909
'Cause if he finds out I'm gone,
he's gonna beat me.

199
00:15:43,993 --> 00:15:47,456
I just wanted to tell you
I love you and I miss you...

200
00:15:47,538 --> 00:15:49,665
...and don't forget about me.

201
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:53,669
- You won't forget about me?
- I won't forget about you.

202
00:15:53,754 --> 00:15:57,131
It's cool.
No matter where he takes you...

203
00:15:57,173 --> 00:15:59,092
...Timbuktu,
it don't matter.

204
00:15:59,175 --> 00:16:02,636
'Cause we're fate.
You know?

205
00:16:02,721 --> 00:16:05,223
Nobody can stop fate.
Nobody can.

206
00:16:07,349 --> 00:16:09,935
One of these nights soon...

207
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:13,064
...I'm gonna be comin' for you.

208
00:16:14,899 --> 00:16:16,776
Gotta go.

209
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:25,701
I love you.

210
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:59,694
Tornado! Tornado!

211
00:16:59,736 --> 00:17:01,696
Move!, move!, move!, move!

212
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:04,908
All right you guys,
get on the goddamn bus! Now!

213
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,581
Get on the fuckin' bus!

214
00:17:16,252 --> 00:17:17,420
Hey?!...

215
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:28,431
Stop or I'll shoot!

216
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:07,511
...break his arms.

217
00:18:07,595 --> 00:18:11,433
There's no action here.
What am I watchin', two fuckin' fags?!

218
00:18:11,515 --> 00:18:14,060
Kill him!
Kill the fuckin' indian!

219
00:18:16,103 --> 00:18:18,189
Where the fuck
do you think you're going?

220
00:18:18,272 --> 00:18:21,275
- I'm going out!
- You ain't going nowhere!

221
00:18:25,154 --> 00:18:27,698
Hey Dick... Mickey's back.

222
00:18:27,782 --> 00:18:30,618
Well, just the prick
I wanna see.

223
00:18:35,998 --> 00:18:37,333
All right, fuck face!

224
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:40,711
Now I'm gonna take your eye out
and show it to you.

225
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:53,140
You been fuckin'
the wrong woman!

226
00:18:57,186 --> 00:19:00,731
You stupid bitch!
You stupid fuckin' bitch!

227
00:19:04,193 --> 00:19:07,196
"You will shut up!
You will eat your food!"

228
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:10,533
"You will listen to me!
Are you clean?!"

229
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,910
"Are you sloppy and wet?!"

230
00:19:12,993 --> 00:19:16,498
"You stupid bitch!"

231
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:20,167
He's dead! He's dead!

232
00:19:20,251 --> 00:19:23,171
Now where's the old bag?

233
00:19:23,254 --> 00:19:26,090
He's dead. He's dead!

234
00:19:31,555 --> 00:19:33,389
Hi, Mom.

235
00:19:47,278 --> 00:19:49,572
You never did nothin'.

236
00:19:58,956 --> 00:19:59,915
Wait!

237
00:20:02,418 --> 00:20:04,171
You're free, Kevin.

238
00:20:11,011 --> 00:20:14,473
Wherever we go,
or whatever happens, Mickey...

239
00:20:14,555 --> 00:20:16,849
when I look up at the stars...

240
00:20:16,891 --> 00:20:20,269
I'll know you're
lookin' up at the same ones.

241
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:22,897
Same ones, baby.

242
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,901
You make every day
feel like kindergarten.

243
00:20:28,611 --> 00:20:30,196
All right!

244
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,907
I think we should get
a whole bunch of stuff,

245
00:20:32,991 --> 00:20:35,619
because I need
a whole new wardrobe,

246
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:37,578
'cause I'm a new woman now, huh?

247
00:20:37,661 --> 00:20:39,623
A- All right,
All right, honey.

248
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:41,582
I'm a new woman!

249
00:20:41,624 --> 00:20:43,417
She's a new woman!

250
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:10,027
Past is behind us, Mal.

251
00:21:10,111 --> 00:21:13,031
It's time to grow up.

252
00:21:13,114 --> 00:21:16,076
We got the road to hell
in front of us.

253
00:21:18,869 --> 00:21:20,997
- Mal?
- Yes?

254
00:21:22,832 --> 00:21:24,417
Will you marry me?

255
00:21:26,378 --> 00:21:28,672
Of course I'll marry you.

256
00:21:28,713 --> 00:21:31,841
I've been waitin' for you
to say that for so long.

257
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,512
Well, where are we
gonna get married?

258
00:21:35,553 --> 00:21:37,597
Right here, Mal.
This is our church.

259
00:21:41,059 --> 00:21:42,978
I got the perfect thing.

260
00:21:56,073 --> 00:21:57,451
Give me your hand.

261
00:21:58,994 --> 00:22:00,995
That's not what I had in mind.

262
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:03,915
Fuck you!
Ow!

263
00:22:04,999 --> 00:22:07,335
Okay, put 'em together.

264
00:22:07,418 --> 00:22:09,671
It's very romantic, baby.

265
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:14,717
We'll be livin'
in all the oceans now.

266
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:28,647
God...
before you and this river...

267
00:22:28,732 --> 00:22:31,859
...and this mountain,
and everything we don't know about.

268
00:22:34,028 --> 00:22:38,283
Mickey, do you take Mallory
to be your lawful wedded wife,

269
00:22:38,366 --> 00:22:41,160
...to have and hold
and treat right until you die?

270
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,499
I do.

271
00:22:48,501 --> 00:22:51,588
Oh, baby.

272
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:55,299
Mallory, do you take Mickey
to be your...

273
00:23:01,139 --> 00:23:04,184
I ain't gonna murder anybody
on our wedding day.

274
00:23:04,225 --> 00:23:07,687
Fuck you!
God!

275
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:10,981
I do.

276
00:23:11,066 --> 00:23:13,902
For all eternity
until you and I die,

277
00:23:13,984 --> 00:23:17,531
...and die and die again...

278
00:23:17,613 --> 00:23:20,908
...'til death do us part.
Yes!

279
00:23:22,034 --> 00:23:26,498
By the power vested in me,
as God of my world...

280
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:29,625
I pronounce us husband and wife.

281
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:48,437
After that, there was no stopping
Mickey and Mallory.

282
00:23:48,477 --> 00:23:51,772
They tore up the countryside with
a vengeance right out of the bible.

283
00:24:17,215 --> 00:24:19,926
Tonight, I'm standing on
Highway 666.

284
00:24:20,009 --> 00:24:24,346
Running through towns like
Cortez, Shiprock, Sheep Springs...

285
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,891
...and ending in Gallup, New Mexico.

286
00:24:26,975 --> 00:24:29,935
To some, a beautiful stretch
of the American landscape...

287
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:33,522
...but to Mickey and Mallory Knox,
who are still at large,

288
00:24:33,606 --> 00:24:38,152
it is a candy lane
of murder and mayhem.

289
00:24:38,236 --> 00:24:40,906
Patrolman Gerald Nash...

290
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:44,910
was just the first
of 12 peace officers...

291
00:24:44,992 --> 00:24:49,622
that Mickey and Mallory murdered during
their reign of terror. A DRAMATIZATION

292
00:24:49,705 --> 00:24:52,792
Gerald and his partner...
Dale Wrigley,

293
00:24:52,876 --> 00:24:55,795
were parked at this donut shop,

294
00:24:55,878 --> 00:24:58,172
Alfie's Donuts, when...

295
00:24:58,256 --> 00:24:59,840
This 1970 Dodge Challenger

296
00:24:59,882 --> 00:25:02,676
pulled up across the street
from the donut shop.

297
00:25:02,718 --> 00:25:05,680
Gerald, only three weeks
out of the academy,

298
00:25:05,721 --> 00:25:09,101
come walkin' out with coffee...

299
00:25:09,183 --> 00:25:10,811
...and my bear claw.

300
00:25:10,893 --> 00:25:12,311
Hey you.

301
00:25:12,354 --> 00:25:13,562
Driver asked him a question.

302
00:25:13,646 --> 00:25:15,731
How the hell
do you get to Farmington?

303
00:25:15,815 --> 00:25:17,817
Looked like he was
giving street directions.

304
00:25:17,901 --> 00:25:21,697
Head on out on 324.
Take it over to 66

305
00:25:21,779 --> 00:25:23,656
and Farmington's up about 65 miles.

306
00:25:23,739 --> 00:25:25,867
Quick ride.
You folks goin' there?

307
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:28,912
When he finished
they waved him thanks...

308
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:30,996
then up come that shotgun.

309
00:25:40,631 --> 00:25:43,427
You cop killin' cocksuckers!

310
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:57,440
In the ensuing chase
a tragic murder occurred.

311
00:25:57,481 --> 00:26:00,651
American bronze medalist
marathon bicyclist...

312
00:26:00,735 --> 00:26:02,653
Brian Smith...

313
00:26:05,865 --> 00:26:08,284
I always wanted to
take a shot at one of 'em.

314
00:26:08,367 --> 00:26:10,871
They're not so easy to hit.

315
00:26:10,953 --> 00:26:12,998
We raped and pillaged
the first show.

316
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,207
We changed the order so
it wouldn't be so obvious.

317
00:26:15,292 --> 00:26:17,753
It needs a new intro
in my opinion.

318
00:26:17,835 --> 00:26:19,170
Who is this guy?

319
00:26:19,253 --> 00:26:21,255
You can't cannibalize yourself
all the time.

320
00:26:21,338 --> 00:26:24,843
- Repetition works, Davey.
- You're gonna wind up with shit.

321
00:26:24,925 --> 00:26:27,846
Do you think those nitwits
out there in zombie land

322
00:26:27,928 --> 00:26:29,513
...remember anything?

323
00:26:29,598 --> 00:26:31,432
This is junk food for the brains.

324
00:26:31,475 --> 00:26:33,350
It's filler, fodder.
Whatever.

325
00:26:33,393 --> 00:26:35,603
Look, just build
it to the interview, okay?

326
00:26:35,687 --> 00:26:40,650
Keep saying that word,
"Live Interview with Wayne Gale!"

327
00:26:40,691 --> 00:26:42,860
Anticipation, Davey,
that's what it's all about.

328
00:26:42,902 --> 00:26:45,571
What do you think of
Mickey and Mallory, huh?

329
00:26:45,654 --> 00:26:47,866
They're hot.
Totally hot.

330
00:26:49,618 --> 00:26:51,703
I love Mickey and Mallory.

331
00:26:51,744 --> 00:26:53,704
They're so cool.

332
00:27:00,795 --> 00:27:03,131
Mickey and Mallory are the best
thing to happen to mass murder

333
00:27:03,214 --> 00:27:04,299
...since Manson.

334
00:27:04,382 --> 00:27:05,634
But way cooler.

335
00:27:05,716 --> 00:27:07,344
Take all the great figures
from the states:

336
00:27:07,385 --> 00:27:11,597
- Elvis; Jack Kerouac;
- James Dean;

337
00:27:11,639 --> 00:27:14,683
- They are supercool.
- Mickey, c'est I'homme!

338
00:27:17,019 --> 00:27:20,022
Jim Morrison; Jack Nicholson;
- add a bloody pail of nitrate

339
00:27:20,107 --> 00:27:22,858
and you got Mickey and Mallory.

340
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,778
I'm not saying I believe
in mass murder or that shit,

341
00:27:25,862 --> 00:27:30,409
- Don't get us wrong.
- We respect human life and all.

342
00:27:30,491 --> 00:27:34,120
But, if I was a mass murderer,
I'd be Mickey and Mallory.

343
00:27:44,255 --> 00:27:48,968
"I'm back in baby's arms"

344
00:27:49,051 --> 00:27:52,723
"I miss those lovin' arms"

345
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:58,185
I haven't seen a cop
for ten minutes.

346
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:03,524
Is there such a thing
as a cop-less town?

347
00:28:03,608 --> 00:28:07,695
That would be paradise,
wouldn't it? Shangri La.

348
00:28:07,779 --> 00:28:11,866
- You wanna get us a hostage?
- No.

349
00:28:11,949 --> 00:28:15,829
What about her?
You from here?

350
00:28:15,911 --> 00:28:19,540
What about her?
Too heavy? Too fat?

351
00:28:21,834 --> 00:28:23,878
What's the matter?

352
00:28:23,961 --> 00:28:27,173
Do you think I'm still sexy?

353
00:28:32,763 --> 00:28:35,931
Oh, man, we might have to
find us a motel here soon.

354
00:28:36,016 --> 00:28:38,350
Soon as I see one
that looks nice

355
00:28:38,392 --> 00:28:41,645
I'm gonna put my little
honey bunny bride down on the bed,

356
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:43,564
tie her up.

357
00:28:52,114 --> 00:28:56,118
"Now I'm back where I belong"

358
00:28:56,202 --> 00:28:58,705
"And in my baby's arms
I'm gonna stay"

359
00:29:00,457 --> 00:29:03,376
Offering a present
in the form of a flower.

360
00:29:06,295 --> 00:29:09,882
Wanna go out and
get something to eat?

361
00:29:09,966 --> 00:29:13,636
No... we'll stay in.
We got plenty of action here.

362
00:29:18,808 --> 00:29:21,060
You know what I've been
thinking about, baby?

363
00:29:25,064 --> 00:29:27,317
Course I know.
You been thinkin' bout...

364
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:31,487
rollin' around in that big
sunflower patch outside of Tulsa.

365
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:33,615
How'd you know?

366
00:29:33,698 --> 00:29:36,701
...and you been thinkin' about
cuttin' your hair short.

367
00:29:39,286 --> 00:29:41,706
And you been thinkin' about us,

368
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:45,292
settlin' down on a boat,
in the middle of a big lake

369
00:29:45,376 --> 00:29:50,006
...with a dog and a jukebox
and a 26' Sony Trinitron.

370
00:29:51,507 --> 00:29:54,885
Baby, I love it
when you can read my mind.

371
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:57,596
I bet I know
what you been thinkin' about.

372
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,725
Yeah, I been thinkin' about...

373
00:29:59,807 --> 00:30:03,310
why they're makin'
all these stupid fuckin' movies.

374
00:30:03,395 --> 00:30:06,313
Doesn't anybody
out there in Hollywood

375
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:09,400
believe in kissin' anymore? Hm?

376
00:30:12,069 --> 00:30:14,239
Love you baby.

377
00:30:16,615 --> 00:30:20,328
I love your knee.
I love your thigh.

378
00:30:22,163 --> 00:30:24,081
Love your stomach.
I love your finger.

379
00:30:24,166 --> 00:30:28,127
"There ain't no entertainment"

380
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:31,088
- Where is it?!
- Goddamn it, Mickey!

381
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:36,802
I just took it off so I wouldn't
snag my hair when I washed it.

382
00:30:36,844 --> 00:30:38,679
Okay, baby, look.

383
00:30:38,763 --> 00:30:41,725
Even if that ring pulls out
every hair on your head,

384
00:30:41,766 --> 00:30:43,684
...it stays on.

385
00:30:43,726 --> 00:30:46,812
If it tears out my eyeballs,
it never comes off.

386
00:30:46,896 --> 00:30:50,733
Every great thing we do
starts with these.

387
00:30:50,816 --> 00:30:55,030
All right.
Since you put it that way.

388
00:30:55,112 --> 00:30:58,449
The impulse for sexual
reproduction is strong and unique.

389
00:31:04,748 --> 00:31:08,794
"I know you really love me"

390
00:31:08,876 --> 00:31:11,587
"But you see my hands"

391
00:31:15,258 --> 00:31:16,760
Why are you lookin' at her?

392
00:31:16,842 --> 00:31:20,972
"I know it must have hurt you"

393
00:31:21,055 --> 00:31:24,100
"It must have hurt your pride"

394
00:31:24,183 --> 00:31:26,060
I'm goin' for a ride.

395
00:31:26,102 --> 00:31:28,270
Uh... baby, hold on.

396
00:31:28,312 --> 00:31:31,108
I thought we could just
throw her into the mix.

397
00:31:33,317 --> 00:31:37,739
Shut up!
Quit being so fucking cute!

398
00:31:37,781 --> 00:31:40,826
You can be cute
all by yourself, little Mickey!

399
00:31:40,908 --> 00:31:44,412
You're so fuckin' pretty!
You go fuck her!

400
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,625
Maybe I just will!

401
00:32:20,115 --> 00:32:22,658
We gonna have some fun?!

402
00:32:22,742 --> 00:32:24,160
No!

403
00:33:16,546 --> 00:33:18,923
Fill her up.

404
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:23,844
- Can I look at that car?
- Go ahead.

405
00:33:48,911 --> 00:33:51,872
That'll be, uh...
17 bucks, lady.

406
00:33:53,666 --> 00:33:55,710
That's a nice 'Vette.

407
00:33:55,793 --> 00:33:59,130
Wait a second.
Don't I know you?

408
00:34:01,132 --> 00:34:03,093
I don't think so.

409
00:34:09,558 --> 00:34:12,101
Do you want to touch me?

410
00:34:12,184 --> 00:34:14,186
Yeah.

411
00:34:20,526 --> 00:34:22,820
Tell me you want me.

412
00:34:22,904 --> 00:34:24,488
I want you.

413
00:34:26,533 --> 00:34:29,285
Tell me I'm beautiful.

414
00:34:29,368 --> 00:34:31,037
Boy, you are beautiful.

415
00:34:31,121 --> 00:34:32,329
Am I beautiful?

416
00:34:32,413 --> 00:34:35,416
You're so fucking beautiful
I can't stand it.

417
00:34:36,251 --> 00:34:38,962
Am I sexy?

418
00:34:39,045 --> 00:34:41,547
Yes, you're sexy.

419
00:34:59,774 --> 00:35:02,276
Go down.

420
00:35:14,998 --> 00:35:18,960
Holy shit.
You're Mallory Knox, ain't ya?

421
00:35:35,936 --> 00:35:39,564
That's the worst fucking head
I ever got in my life!

422
00:35:39,606 --> 00:35:42,442
Next time, don't be
so fuckin' eager!

423
00:35:47,781 --> 00:35:49,657
It's called, "Scagnetti"
on Scagnetti."

424
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,909
It's probably at your local bookstore.

425
00:35:51,993 --> 00:35:54,412
- Why don't you go buy it?
- I WILL.

426
00:35:55,038 --> 00:35:57,540
An author too, huh?

427
00:35:57,623 --> 00:35:59,960
My wife could never wear these.

428
00:36:00,001 --> 00:36:02,503
Now, that is a perfect ass.

429
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,258
It's nice.

430
00:36:06,299 --> 00:36:10,803
There's her arm...
her head.

431
00:36:16,308 --> 00:36:19,311
Dry saliva drops here.
See 'em?

432
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:30,781
That's my type of girl.
I like her.

433
00:36:30,866 --> 00:36:33,117
Let's see what we
got here, Scooter.

434
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,119
Give it up.

435
00:36:39,123 --> 00:36:43,127
Mallory Knox,
meet Jack Scagnetti.

436
00:36:48,966 --> 00:36:52,637
Exactly, where do you
expect us to be goin'?

437
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,764
Where exactly are we
supposed to be?

438
00:36:54,847 --> 00:36:57,266
What town is it that's out here?

439
00:37:00,603 --> 00:37:03,606
Oh, fuck,
it's the fuckin' cheese.

440
00:37:06,776 --> 00:37:09,237
Quit lookin' in the rear view.
Sit back.

441
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:12,740
Put the lighter on the floor.

442
00:37:12,824 --> 00:37:15,034
Where's the bag?

443
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:19,789
Mal... would you relax?

444
00:37:30,716 --> 00:37:34,053
Make a left up here.
I think there's a town.

445
00:37:34,136 --> 00:37:36,055
All I see is desert.

446
00:37:38,891 --> 00:37:40,519
That's right, Cochise...

447
00:37:40,601 --> 00:37:42,937
go eat some more fried bread.

448
00:37:48,318 --> 00:37:50,945
Give me some 'shrooms, Mal?

449
00:37:51,028 --> 00:37:53,489
Mine ain't kickin' in yet.

450
00:38:03,208 --> 00:38:06,586
Turn left?
To what, stupid bitch?

451
00:38:07,837 --> 00:38:10,215
"Aw, you stupid bitch."

452
00:38:10,297 --> 00:38:13,844
"You stupid bitch?"
"You stupid bitch!"

453
00:38:13,926 --> 00:38:17,972
Mickey, that's what
my father used to call me.

454
00:38:18,056 --> 00:38:20,850
Thought you'd be
more creative than that.

455
00:38:20,892 --> 00:38:23,352
You're losin' it, Mickey!
You're losin' it!

456
00:38:25,187 --> 00:38:28,150
Snakes and birds!
Ain't nothin' out here.

457
00:38:28,232 --> 00:38:31,194
I'd go down on a lawman
for a gallon of gas.

458
00:38:32,278 --> 00:38:35,198
Let me tell you something.
This is the 1990's, all right?

459
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:38,159
In this day and age,
a man has to have choices.

460
00:38:38,242 --> 00:38:40,995
A man has to have
a little bit of variety.

461
00:38:41,037 --> 00:38:42,913
What're you talkin' about,
"variety"?

462
00:38:42,955 --> 00:38:46,417
Hostages? You wanna fuck
some other women now?

463
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:48,127
Is that what you're talkin' about?

464
00:38:48,211 --> 00:38:50,088
Why'd you pick me up?

465
00:38:50,171 --> 00:38:53,883
Why'd you take me out of my house
and kill my parents with me?

466
00:38:53,966 --> 00:38:55,844
Ain't you committed to me?

467
00:38:55,926 --> 00:38:57,970
Where are we fuckin' goin'?

468
00:38:58,054 --> 00:39:01,223
Just relax, all right?
It's me, your lover, not some demon,

469
00:39:01,307 --> 00:39:02,851
not your father, all right?
Relax.

470
00:39:02,933 --> 00:39:04,810
No, you're not my fuckin' lover.

471
00:39:04,894 --> 00:39:07,188
You're not my fuckin'-
You been lovin' me?

472
00:39:07,272 --> 00:39:09,524
You been fuckin' lovin' me, huh?

473
00:39:09,607 --> 00:39:11,901
You've been lovin' me
real fuckin' true!

474
00:39:41,514 --> 00:39:44,016
Hey... listen,

475
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:47,269
we got tobacco,
lots of tobacco, if...

476
00:39:47,353 --> 00:39:49,271
You got any gas we can buy?

477
00:39:49,355 --> 00:39:51,273
I don't think he speaks English.

478
00:39:51,357 --> 00:39:53,777
Push comes to shove,
we can snatch that donkey

479
00:39:53,819 --> 00:39:55,611
and ride on outta here.

480
00:39:58,198 --> 00:40:00,032
Come on in.

481
00:40:05,454 --> 00:40:07,039
Come on in.

482
00:40:09,291 --> 00:40:12,586
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!

483
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:15,840
That a friendly snake?

484
00:40:15,924 --> 00:40:18,092
That's a rattlesnake.

485
00:40:20,761 --> 00:40:23,848
My name is Mal-lo-ry.

486
00:40:24,516 --> 00:40:27,601
This is Mick-ey.

487
00:40:27,685 --> 00:40:29,729
How...

488
00:40:29,813 --> 00:40:31,480
you doin'...?

489
00:40:40,157 --> 00:40:41,949
We're not from here.

490
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:59,133
It's kinda like "The Twilight Zone"
or something.

491
00:41:01,511 --> 00:41:03,888
Is that your wife?

492
00:41:15,691 --> 00:41:17,568
Oh.

493
00:41:26,243 --> 00:41:28,329
Washington...

494
00:41:31,833 --> 00:41:33,919
Oh, he died?

495
00:41:33,959 --> 00:41:35,837
That was your baby, huh?

496
00:41:45,638 --> 00:41:47,723
Feel the demons here, Mal?

497
00:41:47,807 --> 00:41:50,102
I think we're the demons.

498
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,361
Who you out there fuckin'?

499
00:44:04,443 --> 00:44:06,445
- Your father.
- Bitch!

500
00:44:52,491 --> 00:44:54,493
I said, shut up!

501
00:44:54,536 --> 00:44:56,246
Come here, you peckerhead.

502
00:44:56,328 --> 00:44:57,913
Don't... don't hit me!

503
00:45:02,043 --> 00:45:04,795
Mom...?

504
00:45:04,879 --> 00:45:07,048
I hate you,
you little asshole!

505
00:45:23,397 --> 00:45:25,483
This is so bad!

506
00:45:25,566 --> 00:45:28,736
- What did you do, Mickey?
- I didn't mean it!

507
00:45:48,882 --> 00:45:51,760
Bad, bad, bad...!

508
00:45:53,386 --> 00:45:55,137
Bad, bad!

509
00:46:04,647 --> 00:46:07,192
Okay... get it together, now.

510
00:46:12,988 --> 00:46:14,740
Come on-!

511
00:46:25,877 --> 00:46:28,421
Come on, Mal!

512
00:46:28,504 --> 00:46:29,922
Mal...?

513
00:46:30,005 --> 00:46:31,841
Let's go!

514
00:46:31,882 --> 00:46:33,551
Come on!

515
00:46:34,885 --> 00:46:38,305
Why?
Why did you do that?

516
00:46:40,307 --> 00:46:43,102
It was an accident.
This whole fuckin' thing is crazy.

517
00:46:43,185 --> 00:46:45,479
There are no accidents, Mickey.

518
00:46:45,563 --> 00:46:48,065
I'm human, Mal,
and I made a mistake,

519
00:46:48,107 --> 00:46:50,694
- and you gotta understand...
- You are sick!

520
00:46:50,776 --> 00:46:52,611
You killed life!

521
00:46:52,653 --> 00:46:53,905
He fed us!

522
00:46:53,988 --> 00:46:56,408
He took us in there!

523
00:46:56,449 --> 00:46:58,200
Mal, that is a harsh indictment.

524
00:46:58,285 --> 00:46:59,785
Mal... whoa-!
Hold it, hold it!

525
00:47:00,661 --> 00:47:02,246
Leave me alone!
I'm going!

526
00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:04,290
No, Mal! Hang on!

527
00:47:05,833 --> 00:47:07,543
I got bit!

528
00:47:09,253 --> 00:47:10,546
- Hold on, Mal!
- Oh, shit!

529
00:47:13,507 --> 00:47:16,093
- Go on, Mal!
- I think there's more!

530
00:47:16,177 --> 00:47:18,138
I know, hang on, hang on!

531
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:23,101
Stay right there, Mal!

532
00:47:24,143 --> 00:47:26,020
There's more!

533
00:47:28,022 --> 00:47:30,232
Hop on, Mal.

534
00:47:31,651 --> 00:47:32,943
Oh-!

535
00:47:40,743 --> 00:47:44,538
Know something?
Badasses don't die, Mal.

536
00:47:57,385 --> 00:47:59,804
It's okay...

537
00:47:59,845 --> 00:48:01,472
Just dreamin' and shit.

538
00:48:01,555 --> 00:48:03,725
It's just a dream, Mal.

539
00:48:08,979 --> 00:48:11,232
My name's Pinky.

540
00:48:11,316 --> 00:48:12,983
Oh, yeah,
I remember, now.

541
00:48:13,068 --> 00:48:16,654
My brother gave me this name
when I was six or so.

542
00:48:16,737 --> 00:48:19,699
He said, "Well, you're about as big
as my little pinky."

543
00:48:23,537 --> 00:48:26,039
I really don't like
these cheap motels.

544
00:48:26,122 --> 00:48:28,875
Give me the creeps.

545
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:32,628
Say, are you a real cop?

546
00:48:32,713 --> 00:48:34,130
I'm a real cop.

547
00:48:34,171 --> 00:48:36,173
You're not gonna hurt me,
are you?

548
00:48:36,215 --> 00:48:38,342
I never hurt anybody
in my whole life.

549
00:48:38,427 --> 00:48:39,885
I'm the law, okay?

550
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:42,346
I'm your protector.

551
00:48:42,431 --> 00:48:45,057
Come on over here.
Come here.

552
00:48:45,141 --> 00:48:47,936
Come on over here.
Take off them shoes.

553
00:48:48,769 --> 00:48:51,398
You're real pretty.

554
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,441
Step up on the bed.

555
00:48:56,777 --> 00:48:58,988
That's nice.
Move around.

556
00:49:02,324 --> 00:49:04,452
Take off your bra.

557
00:49:05,619 --> 00:49:07,956
Mmm... that's nice.

558
00:49:09,457 --> 00:49:12,793
Come here. Come on down here
and gimme a kiss.

559
00:49:12,877 --> 00:49:15,422
Give big Jack a kiss.

560
00:49:15,504 --> 00:49:18,675
- You like me?
- Yes.

561
00:49:18,758 --> 00:49:22,219
Pinky...
you ever been strangled?

562
00:49:22,304 --> 00:49:24,138
Hey, just kidding with you.

563
00:49:24,221 --> 00:49:26,850
Come on,
I'm just kidding with you.

564
00:49:26,932 --> 00:49:29,101
Come here.
Give me a kiss.

565
00:49:35,566 --> 00:49:39,403
I'm just kiddin'.
I'm just kiddin'.

566
00:49:44,993 --> 00:49:47,620
Come here.
I'm just kiddin', okay?

567
00:49:52,626 --> 00:49:54,210
AAAAAHHHH!

568
00:49:59,674 --> 00:50:01,801
Fuckin' bitch!

569
00:50:03,095 --> 00:50:07,556
Mickey!
I'm coming to get you.

570
00:50:41,882 --> 00:50:43,885
I'm not gonna make it.

571
00:50:43,968 --> 00:50:45,678
I feel so cold.

572
00:50:45,761 --> 00:50:48,515
You're gonna make it, Mal.
Get mad.

573
00:50:48,597 --> 00:50:52,310
Just go get the stuff...
go get the stuff then.

574
00:50:52,393 --> 00:50:54,187
All right.

575
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:01,278
Once they were average citizens.

576
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,947
Living drab
nothing-ever-happens lives.

577
00:51:04,030 --> 00:51:09,118
But then these sweethearts
began a cross country murder spree

578
00:51:09,201 --> 00:51:13,581
which has lasted
only three terrifying weeks,

579
00:51:13,665 --> 00:51:18,253
but has left 48
known bodies in its wake,

580
00:51:18,335 --> 00:51:21,213
including Mallory's own...

581
00:51:21,298 --> 00:51:23,550
...mum and dad.

582
00:51:25,176 --> 00:51:26,677
Oh, shit.

583
00:51:26,761 --> 00:51:29,930
- All needlessly...
- Excuse me.

584
00:51:30,014 --> 00:51:33,392
Aloha.

585
00:51:33,434 --> 00:51:36,812
Uh... chief?

586
00:51:36,896 --> 00:51:40,066
Rattlesnake took a chunk
out of us a ways back...

587
00:51:40,107 --> 00:51:43,069
and me and my wife
are pretty sick.

588
00:51:43,110 --> 00:51:46,322
Could be dying,
you never can tell about these things.

589
00:51:46,405 --> 00:51:51,369
So, how's about you
ungluing your ass from that boob tube.

590
00:51:51,452 --> 00:51:55,331
and getting us
some snake juice... pronto.

591
00:52:04,507 --> 00:52:06,550
Found it yet?

592
00:52:10,763 --> 00:52:13,141
They stormed in with shotguns...

593
00:52:13,224 --> 00:52:14,851
and after liberating the establishment

594
00:52:14,934 --> 00:52:17,395
of all the firearms they could carry,

595
00:52:17,478 --> 00:52:21,023
and various personal
idiosyncratic knickknacks...

596
00:52:21,065 --> 00:52:24,527
they killed every customer
in the place without hesitation.

597
00:52:26,237 --> 00:52:28,240
"Come on... money!
Faster! Faster!"

598
00:52:28,322 --> 00:52:31,909
But they always leave
one clerk alive...

599
00:52:31,992 --> 00:52:36,539
...to tell the tale
of Mickey... and Mallory.

600
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:42,628
I'll be damned.
Mal?!

601
00:52:50,554 --> 00:52:52,513
Mal!

602
00:52:52,596 --> 00:52:53,974
Mal, cops!

603
00:52:54,056 --> 00:52:56,476
Hurry! I'll meet you
out front with the car.

604
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:59,645
Go get the car!
I'll get the snake-bite juice!

605
00:53:17,163 --> 00:53:19,040
No, please!

606
00:53:23,128 --> 00:53:26,130
Well, that was sweet.
Snake juice.

607
00:53:35,097 --> 00:53:37,349
We don't carry it.
Hospital.

608
00:53:37,434 --> 00:53:40,811
Yahembey?
This shit keep you hard?

609
00:53:42,355 --> 00:53:45,691
I'm the only clerk left.

610
00:53:45,775 --> 00:53:48,611
- You're forgettin' something.
- W-What's that?

611
00:53:50,488 --> 00:53:54,700
If I don't kill you...
what is there to talk about?

612
00:53:54,785 --> 00:53:57,079
- Fuckin' squid.
- No!

613
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,046
Mal?!

614
00:54:18,974 --> 00:54:20,976
I forgive you, baby.

615
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,361
All right, get off of him!

616
00:54:32,446 --> 00:54:33,948
Mal!

617
00:54:41,122 --> 00:54:45,919
Fuck you!

618
00:54:47,712 --> 00:54:49,505
What a stupid bitch!

619
00:54:51,633 --> 00:54:53,509
Shut the fuck up!

620
00:54:55,761 --> 00:54:57,263
Kill 'em all!,
kill 'em all!

621
00:54:57,347 --> 00:55:00,809
Hey you bonehead sissy,
this is Jack Scagnetti, Knox!

622
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:02,852
Now you put that gun down!

623
00:55:02,935 --> 00:55:05,062
Fuck you, Scagnetti!

624
00:55:05,146 --> 00:55:07,440
Now!
I'll cut her tits off!

625
00:55:07,523 --> 00:55:10,026
Go ahead, Scagnetti!
I'll get her some silicon implants.

626
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:12,528
I swear to God,
I'll cut her fuckin' tits off,

627
00:55:12,821 --> 00:55:13,904
right here...
...right now!

628
00:55:13,988 --> 00:55:15,906
Go ahead!
You ain't got the balls.

629
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:18,242
Don't give up!
He ain't gonna do it!

630
00:55:18,326 --> 00:55:19,870
Shut the fuck up!

631
00:55:23,205 --> 00:55:25,249
Watch this!

632
00:55:25,332 --> 00:55:26,752
Hey, you like that?!

633
00:55:26,834 --> 00:55:27,793
Oh, God!
Okay!

634
00:55:27,878 --> 00:55:29,920
- Hey, put that gun down!
- Don't cut her!

635
00:55:30,004 --> 00:55:32,131
Put your hands
where I can see them,

636
00:55:32,173 --> 00:55:34,091
and step out in the light.

637
00:55:34,176 --> 00:55:35,801
Kill 'em all!
Kill 'em all!

638
00:55:35,843 --> 00:55:38,888
All right!
I'm coming out!

639
00:55:42,099 --> 00:55:44,602
Put your hands
where I can see 'em!

640
00:55:44,685 --> 00:55:47,396
Now step out in the light.
Come on.

641
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:51,817
Yeah, come on out here.
Step outside, big shot.

642
00:55:51,902 --> 00:55:53,944
All right!

643
00:55:54,029 --> 00:55:57,656
Someone come get this bitch.

644
00:55:57,740 --> 00:56:00,701
Come on...
get the big bad wolf.

645
00:56:02,788 --> 00:56:04,664
Come on, come on,
give me that.

646
00:56:08,167 --> 00:56:10,086
- You're in my light, motherfucker!
Shove over!

647
00:56:12,213 --> 00:56:13,881
Oh, God, my eye!

648
00:56:13,964 --> 00:56:15,591
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

649
00:56:15,633 --> 00:56:18,053
Don't kill him!
I'm going to fuck with him!

650
00:56:18,094 --> 00:56:19,595
No! Do not kill him!

651
00:56:19,678 --> 00:56:22,139
One camera
all you can muster, Jack? Huh?

652
00:56:22,224 --> 00:56:24,850
You ain't that big a star yet,
cocksucker.

653
00:56:24,893 --> 00:56:27,520
You're on, you and me,
one on one, let's go.

654
00:56:27,603 --> 00:56:30,314
Fuck you! Yeah!
Bring it, bring it, bring it.

655
00:56:30,399 --> 00:56:32,483
Fry this cop killer!

656
00:56:41,534 --> 00:56:43,536
How's that feel, big shot?

657
00:56:46,747 --> 00:56:48,290
Fuck you!

658
00:56:50,209 --> 00:56:52,128
Make that motherfucker dance!

659
00:56:54,797 --> 00:56:58,509
Hey, Mickey.
Want a drink?

660
00:56:58,592 --> 00:57:00,594
- Fuck you!
- Just jokin'.

661
00:57:03,264 --> 00:57:05,892
Where's my baby?
Where is she?

662
00:57:10,063 --> 00:57:12,106
Let her go... let her go.

663
00:57:12,148 --> 00:57:15,359
You okay, babe?
Yeah, you're all right.

664
00:57:15,444 --> 00:57:17,653
"These boots were made for walkin"'

665
00:57:17,738 --> 00:57:20,740
"And that's just what they'll do"

666
00:57:20,823 --> 00:57:22,783
"One of these days these boots"

667
00:57:22,868 --> 00:57:25,370
"Are gonna walk all over you"

668
00:57:28,873 --> 00:57:32,334
Hey, no pictures!
Clear the area!

669
00:58:09,581 --> 00:58:11,791
- Always wanted to meet you, Scagnetti.
- Oh?

670
00:58:11,875 --> 00:58:14,753
I really respect you.
You know what?

671
00:58:14,835 --> 00:58:16,212
I even bought your book.

672
00:58:16,295 --> 00:58:18,672
- And I read the whole goddamn thing.
- Oh, yeah?

673
00:58:18,757 --> 00:58:20,716
How 'bout an autograph?

674
00:58:23,219 --> 00:58:26,305
Warden...

675
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:28,683
...Jack Scagnetti.

676
00:58:28,766 --> 00:58:32,019
Dwight McClusky.
Welcome to hell.

677
00:58:32,061 --> 00:58:33,438
Great to meet you warden.

678
00:58:33,479 --> 00:58:35,940
So how the hell
are my two favorite assholes?

679
00:58:36,023 --> 00:58:38,360
We got them two ratfucks
back up in there.

680
00:58:38,442 --> 00:58:40,862
- I guess you'll want to see 'em.
- Why not?

681
00:58:40,903 --> 00:58:42,863
- I seen you on TV.
- Oh, yeah?

682
00:58:42,905 --> 00:58:44,491
I even read your
goddamned book.

683
00:58:44,573 --> 00:58:45,700
- I'm impressed.
- Oh.

684
00:58:45,741 --> 00:58:47,284
Surprised Hollywood
ain't found you yet.

685
00:58:47,327 --> 00:58:49,495
Your story would make
a lot better movie

686
00:58:49,578 --> 00:58:50,746
than that "Serpico" shit.

687
00:58:50,830 --> 00:58:52,124
I'll tell you something, Scagnetti...

688
00:58:52,206 --> 00:58:54,333
in all my days
in the penal business-

689
00:58:54,418 --> 00:58:57,002
and that ain't
no small amount of days, right boys?

690
00:58:57,087 --> 00:58:57,795
- Oh, no.
- Nope.

691
00:58:57,878 --> 00:59:00,005
Mickey and Mallory Knox
are, without a doubt,

692
00:59:00,089 --> 00:59:02,008
the most twisted,
depraved pair of shitfucks...

693
00:59:02,091 --> 00:59:05,052
it's ever been my displeasure
to lay my goddamn eyes on.

694
00:59:05,095 --> 00:59:06,721
I'm telling you,
these goddamn motherfuckers...

695
00:59:06,805 --> 00:59:08,890
are a walking reminder
of how fucked up

696
00:59:08,973 --> 00:59:10,016
...this system really is.

697
00:59:10,099 --> 00:59:12,852
Don't get me started, okay?
Don't get me started.

698
00:59:12,894 --> 00:59:14,980
Dwight.
You call me Dwight.

699
00:59:15,062 --> 00:59:17,148
They killed a shitload
of inmates and guards?

700
00:59:17,231 --> 00:59:18,899
Three inmates, five guards,
one shrink...

701
00:59:18,984 --> 00:59:20,276
...all in one year's time.

702
00:59:20,318 --> 00:59:22,111
Open that goddamned gate.

703
00:59:22,194 --> 00:59:23,654
- Psychiatrist?
- Yeah.

704
00:59:23,738 --> 00:59:25,866
Miss Mallory,
strangled his ass...

705
00:59:25,906 --> 00:59:28,409
when he made mistake of asking
what her parents were like.

706
00:59:28,492 --> 00:59:30,786
She done it all
on tranquillizers.

707
00:59:34,957 --> 00:59:37,209
Ain't love grand?
Ain't that the truth?

708
00:59:37,294 --> 00:59:39,963
it's like that other big lie...

709
00:59:40,046 --> 00:59:42,590
"Love makes the world go 'round."

710
00:59:43,007 --> 00:59:44,633
I need to talk to you
about something...

711
00:59:44,717 --> 00:59:48,095
How's a fella like you get to be
a specialist in psychos, anyway?

712
00:59:48,137 --> 00:59:50,890
I'd recommend
having your mother killed by one.

713
00:59:50,973 --> 00:59:53,684
After that happened,
I developed an interest.

714
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:56,812
I spent the first part
of my life in Texas.

715
00:59:56,896 --> 00:59:59,148
You don't have an accent.

716
00:59:59,232 --> 01:00:00,858
I don't wanna talk
like those assholes.

717
01:00:00,942 --> 01:00:02,401
My mother was from Texas.

718
01:00:02,486 --> 01:00:04,780
The ones who beat
the shit out of me.

719
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:08,074
When I was eight
we went to play in the park.

720
01:00:08,157 --> 01:00:11,453
The same day Charles Whitman
started shooting strangers

721
01:00:11,535 --> 01:00:14,413
from the top of
the University of Texas.

722
01:00:14,455 --> 01:00:16,457
- And you was with her?
- Sure was.

723
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:18,919
The thing is,
I didn't hear any of the shots.

724
01:00:21,045 --> 01:00:22,755
One minute
I'm with my mother...

725
01:00:25,299 --> 01:00:26,842
and all of a sudden,
chest explodes.

726
01:00:26,927 --> 01:00:28,386
She hits the ground.

727
01:00:28,469 --> 01:00:31,055
Her forearm flies off,
her hip explodes,

728
01:00:31,138 --> 01:00:34,309
and I'm not hearing
any of these shots.

729
01:00:34,392 --> 01:00:36,978
Boom!
Chest explodes.

730
01:00:48,406 --> 01:00:51,158
I spent all goddamned day
lying on the grass,

731
01:00:51,242 --> 01:00:53,369
being eaten alive
by fuckin' ant's, thinking...

732
01:00:53,412 --> 01:00:54,913
"What happened to my mom?"

733
01:00:54,995 --> 01:00:57,456
And since then
I've had a strong opinion

734
01:00:57,498 --> 01:01:00,627
about the psychopathic fringe
thriving in America's fast food culture.

735
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:03,170
I tend not to exhibit
the self discipline,

736
01:01:03,212 --> 01:01:04,714
becoming of a police officer.

737
01:01:04,797 --> 01:01:05,381
You got it right, Jack.

738
01:01:05,464 --> 01:01:08,342
You don't mind do you,
if I call you Jack?

739
01:01:12,179 --> 01:01:14,223
We got an army of
shrinks in here...

740
01:01:14,306 --> 01:01:17,227
that talks about mania and
schizophrenia and multiphrenia...

741
01:01:17,309 --> 01:01:19,146
...and obsessions.
it makes me sick.

742
01:01:19,228 --> 01:01:21,397
it's all pride.
it's arrogance... it's bullshit.

743
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:23,607
Mickey and Mallory Knox

744
01:01:23,649 --> 01:01:26,527
are not the sickest
I've ever seen.

745
01:01:26,570 --> 01:01:30,823
Tonight's movie will be
"Escape from the Planet of the Apes".

746
01:01:36,579 --> 01:01:39,206
So, why me, Dwight?
What's this really about?

747
01:01:39,290 --> 01:01:40,917
Can you feel it, Jack?

748
01:01:40,958 --> 01:01:43,127
- Silence in the air?
- Yeah.

749
01:01:43,210 --> 01:01:45,921
it's the one thing
you don't want in prison, Jack.

750
01:01:45,963 --> 01:01:47,882
- Silence.
- Uh-huh.

751
01:01:47,966 --> 01:01:49,216
You boys all right?

752
01:01:49,301 --> 01:01:51,135
What the fuck
is you lookin' at?

753
01:01:51,218 --> 01:01:52,219
You boys all right?

754
01:01:52,303 --> 01:01:54,680
I said, what the fuck
is you lookin' at?

755
01:01:58,601 --> 01:02:00,394
Drop it!
Drop it!

756
01:02:00,478 --> 01:02:01,688
Try this on, big boy!

757
01:02:01,771 --> 01:02:04,106
Try it on there,
you son-of-a-bitch.

758
01:02:04,191 --> 01:02:06,567
Now come on up here! Boy!

759
01:02:06,651 --> 01:02:08,528
Now sit your ass up here.

760
01:02:10,905 --> 01:02:13,199
Stick his ass
in F block for a month!

761
01:02:13,282 --> 01:02:15,659
Then bring him to see me!

762
01:02:15,743 --> 01:02:20,081
Jesus Christ, Dwight,
you could be on American Gladiators.

763
01:02:20,165 --> 01:02:22,333
30 minutes a day,
shake and roll it.

764
01:02:22,375 --> 01:02:23,834
Somebody goes for you...

765
01:02:23,876 --> 01:02:27,214
you go straight for
their throat, right?

766
01:02:27,255 --> 01:02:30,383
Mickey and Mallory got
the whole prison worked up.

767
01:02:30,467 --> 01:02:33,345
- Like sharks to chum bait.
- Smell of blood drives 'em nuts.

768
01:02:33,427 --> 01:02:35,513
80*/* of these assholes
are violent offenders.

769
01:02:35,554 --> 01:02:37,349
We're over 200*/* capacity.

770
01:02:37,431 --> 01:02:39,517
This ain't a prison anymore,
it's a time bomb.

771
01:02:41,435 --> 01:02:42,353
Fry the pricks.

772
01:02:42,436 --> 01:02:44,189
Every time we do
they kill somebody new,

773
01:02:44,271 --> 01:02:46,900
and we gotta start
all over again.

774
01:02:46,941 --> 01:02:49,652
Sounds like a hemorrhoid
you can't get rid of, Dwight.

775
01:02:49,736 --> 01:02:52,863
That's why we're sending them
for testing to Nystrom with you.

776
01:02:52,947 --> 01:02:54,073
Lobotomy Bay?

777
01:02:54,156 --> 01:02:57,410
Vegetable land.
Home of the criminally insane.

778
01:02:57,993 --> 01:03:00,705
- That hasn't been done in years.
- We got a stage one ruling.

779
01:03:00,789 --> 01:03:02,957
it won't stick with these asshole
do-good shrinks around,

780
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:05,710
but it'll get 'em under your control
for a couple of hours.

781
01:03:05,752 --> 01:03:06,128
Then what?

782
01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:08,671
You're a celebrated law man.
Public loves you.

783
01:03:08,754 --> 01:03:11,883
15 years on the force.
Best-seller out in paperback.

784
01:03:11,966 --> 01:03:15,428
A modern day Pat Garrett with a
deadly axe to grind with maniacs.

785
01:03:15,470 --> 01:03:17,389
That is why
you have been chosen

786
01:03:17,430 --> 01:03:18,973
to delver Mr. and Mrs. Knox.

787
01:03:19,056 --> 01:03:22,184
We, the Prison Board, know
once you get 'em on the road...

788
01:03:22,226 --> 01:03:24,311
- if anything should happen...
- An accident.

789
01:03:24,395 --> 01:03:25,896
- Fire.
- Escape attempt, anything.

790
01:03:25,981 --> 01:03:27,773
Jack "Super Cop" Scagnetti
will be there,

791
01:03:27,858 --> 01:03:29,985
to look out for his
public's best interest.

792
01:03:30,026 --> 01:03:31,569
I'm getting the picture here, Dwight.

793
01:03:31,652 --> 01:03:33,196
'Course, nobody
in their right minds

794
01:03:33,279 --> 01:03:34,822
will cry for these
two pigfuckers...

795
01:03:34,906 --> 01:03:37,116
if they happen to take
a little lead.

796
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:38,535
A lot of lead, Jack.

797
01:03:38,617 --> 01:03:41,204
You write the script.
Call it anything you want to.

798
01:03:41,246 --> 01:03:41,997
"Showdown in Mojave"

799
01:03:42,038 --> 01:03:43,831
"The Extermination
of Mickey and Mallory Knox'

800
01:03:43,915 --> 01:03:45,208
I don't give a shit.

801
01:03:45,291 --> 01:03:47,043
I'm giving you
my two best men,

802
01:03:47,127 --> 01:03:48,044
Kavanaugh and Wurlitzer.

803
01:03:48,086 --> 01:03:51,380
We got a special disliking'
for these punkolas!

804
01:03:53,966 --> 01:03:55,843
Have we found our man?

805
01:03:57,262 --> 01:03:59,805
You know her,
you love her.

806
01:03:59,889 --> 01:04:02,058
You cannot
fucking live without her...

807
01:04:02,099 --> 01:04:05,144
Mallory Knox.

808
01:04:05,228 --> 01:04:08,189
"...One in my heart"

809
01:04:08,230 --> 01:04:10,900
"I guess I was born"

810
01:04:10,984 --> 01:04:14,695
"Naturally born"

811
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:17,406
"Born bad"

812
01:04:19,408 --> 01:04:22,203
Hey, Knox. Somebody out here
that wants to meet you.

813
01:04:22,286 --> 01:04:23,747
"Born bad"

814
01:04:23,829 --> 01:04:27,416
"it's such a sin"

815
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:30,961
"I guess I was born"

816
01:04:31,045 --> 01:04:34,131
"Naturally born"

817
01:04:34,173 --> 01:04:37,134
"Born bad"

818
01:04:44,392 --> 01:04:45,310
Jesus Christ!

819
01:04:45,393 --> 01:04:47,979
Don't worry about it.
She does this all the time.

820
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:50,649
She ain't changed a bit, huh?

821
01:04:50,731 --> 01:04:51,983
So, where's the other half?

822
01:04:52,066 --> 01:04:54,653
We got his stinking' ass
in the deepest, darkest cell

823
01:04:54,735 --> 01:04:55,736
...in the whole dungeon.

824
01:04:55,821 --> 01:04:57,405
You can't see him right now.

825
01:04:57,489 --> 01:04:59,825
- He's got a special visitor.
- Oh, yeah, who's that?

826
01:04:59,907 --> 01:05:00,742
Wayne Gale.

827
01:05:00,825 --> 01:05:03,369
Wayne Gale?
The TV scumbag?

828
01:05:03,452 --> 01:05:06,123
We call them medla, Jack.
Don't you like the media?

829
01:05:06,163 --> 01:05:09,291
A worm in my bloodstool's
got more attraction to me than that.

830
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:11,168
The guy lives
to fuck cops over.

831
01:05:11,253 --> 01:05:13,087
Can't say no to the media, Jack.

832
01:05:13,130 --> 01:05:15,089
You want this job?

833
01:05:15,172 --> 01:05:16,591
You come say hello.

834
01:05:20,845 --> 01:05:22,388
I have a television show.

835
01:05:22,472 --> 01:05:24,640
And every couple of weeks we do-

836
01:05:24,682 --> 01:05:26,267
it's our thing about
"Current America"-

837
01:05:26,350 --> 01:05:28,979
we do a profile
on a different serial killer.

838
01:05:29,061 --> 01:05:31,147
Technically, mass murderer.

839
01:05:31,230 --> 01:05:32,523
Well, whatever you want.

840
01:05:32,565 --> 01:05:35,026
Anyway, the episode we did
on Mickey and Mallory,

841
01:05:35,110 --> 01:05:36,902
was one of our
most popular ones.

842
01:05:36,987 --> 01:05:38,905
Ever do one on
John Wayne Gacy?

843
01:05:38,946 --> 01:05:39,947
Uh, yeah.

844
01:05:40,032 --> 01:05:41,323
Who got the higher rating?

845
01:05:41,407 --> 01:05:42,742
You blew him away.

846
01:05:42,783 --> 01:05:45,536
What about that crazy motherfucker,
Ted Bundy?

847
01:05:45,619 --> 01:05:48,956
Oh, that crazy guy?
You got the larger Nieison share.

848
01:05:48,999 --> 01:05:52,168
You're big.
You're huge.

849
01:05:52,209 --> 01:05:55,337
What about Manson?

850
01:05:55,421 --> 01:05:57,966
Manson beat you.

851
01:05:58,049 --> 01:06:00,217
Well, it's pretty hard
to beat the king.

852
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:03,846
Yeah. Anyway,
Julle, my producer and I...

853
01:06:03,929 --> 01:06:07,391
We've waited a long time
to do a follow up episode on you.

854
01:06:07,476 --> 01:06:09,394
And that time has definitely come.

855
01:06:13,522 --> 01:06:16,818
I feel it's apparent to anyone
who's hip to what's going on,

856
01:06:16,901 --> 01:06:19,028
that these prison boys
have thrown the Constitution...

857
01:06:19,112 --> 01:06:21,197
...straight out the fucking window.

858
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:24,076
You and Mallory may be killers,
but nuts? insane?!

859
01:06:24,158 --> 01:06:25,743
Today they wipe clean your mind,

860
01:06:25,827 --> 01:06:27,787
because they feel
your actions are dangerous.

861
01:06:27,828 --> 01:06:29,580
Tomorrow, they might
clean my mind...

862
01:06:29,663 --> 01:06:31,333
or dump me into
fucking syndication,

863
01:06:31,415 --> 01:06:33,751
because they feel
what I say is dangerous.

864
01:06:33,835 --> 01:06:35,586
Where does it all end?!

865
01:06:35,669 --> 01:06:39,090
Now, I have interviews
with the Prison Board,

866
01:06:39,174 --> 01:06:41,217
and the psychiatrist,
Emil Reingold,

867
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:43,762
and with that warden,
Dwight McClusky,

868
01:06:43,844 --> 01:06:46,263
and I'll tell you, Mickey,
they look bad.

869
01:06:46,347 --> 01:06:49,225
Now, if you give an exclusive
to Wayne Gale,

870
01:06:49,308 --> 01:06:51,977
we are talking
a event here,

871
01:06:52,061 --> 01:06:54,313
some promos on the Super Bowl.

872
01:06:54,398 --> 01:06:56,900
The network will cream for it.
Oh, my God!

873
01:06:56,982 --> 01:06:59,985
What a great idea, Julle!

874
01:07:00,069 --> 01:07:02,072
We are about
nothing less...

875
01:07:02,154 --> 01:07:04,949
...than television history.

876
01:07:05,032 --> 01:07:07,451
The first sit-down,
in-depth interview

877
01:07:07,493 --> 01:07:10,204
with the most charismatic
serial killer ever,

878
01:07:10,247 --> 01:07:13,709
one day before he's being
shipped away to a mental hospital...

879
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:16,712
...for the rest of his life.

880
01:07:16,794 --> 01:07:19,338
This is Wallace and Noriega.

881
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:24,553
This is Elton John confessing
his bisexuality to Rolling Stone.

882
01:07:24,635 --> 01:07:26,804
This is the Maysles Brothers
at Altamont.

883
01:07:26,887 --> 01:07:29,557
This is the fucking
Nixon/Frost interviews.

884
01:07:30,891 --> 01:07:32,810
What do you say, mate?

885
01:07:32,893 --> 01:07:36,398
Why in the hell are you lettln'
this scumbag do this, Dwight?

886
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:39,443
Oh, relax. if I don't,
we'll be excoriated in the press.

887
01:07:39,483 --> 01:07:42,611
if I do, it'll be weeks
before they can clear it.

888
01:07:42,695 --> 01:07:43,696
Legal, appeals.

889
01:07:43,780 --> 01:07:47,034
M&M are gonna be toast
before that ever happens. Rlght, Jack?

890
01:07:47,075 --> 01:07:50,453
Nobody's gonna give a flylng fuck
about two dead losers.

891
01:07:50,536 --> 01:07:52,621
What do you say?

892
01:07:52,705 --> 01:07:53,956
Time, motherfucker.

893
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:55,291
Hey, hey...
come on!

894
01:07:57,084 --> 01:07:58,295
Hey, come on!

895
01:07:58,377 --> 01:08:00,921
Leave him alone,
he's a human being, for Christ sake!

896
01:08:00,964 --> 01:08:04,258
Wait a minute...
just let him answer me.

897
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:06,678
Time's running' out, mate.
What's the answer?

898
01:08:09,096 --> 01:08:10,891
I say, go for it.

899
01:08:15,062 --> 01:08:17,229
in any case, he says yes.

900
01:08:17,313 --> 01:08:20,858
I thought he would, but
we're gonna keep contact to a minimum.

901
01:08:20,941 --> 01:08:23,444
Okay... you just give me a large room,

902
01:08:23,527 --> 01:08:26,030
I'll take it from there, okay?
We're stealth journalists.

903
01:08:26,114 --> 01:08:28,741
if I was you, I'd worry more
about the promos

904
01:08:28,825 --> 01:08:30,744
that start hittin'
the air next week.

905
01:08:30,826 --> 01:08:33,913
You'll be a national face, Warden,
a hero to the public.

906
01:08:33,996 --> 01:08:35,414
- No...
- it's true. Who knows...?

907
01:08:35,499 --> 01:08:37,541
you could even
launch a new career here.

908
01:08:37,625 --> 01:08:41,253
Julle, my producer, is gonna fax you
in the morning with the details.

909
01:08:41,337 --> 01:08:43,422
I've gotta get back
to the Rotten Apple.

910
01:08:43,507 --> 01:08:46,551
I'm doing a benefit tonight
for the homeless transsexual veterans.

911
01:08:49,012 --> 01:08:50,846
"Dearest Mallory:

912
01:08:50,931 --> 01:08:53,225
You once told me
I had no feelings.

913
01:08:53,265 --> 01:08:55,976
You were right,
and you were wrong.

914
01:08:56,061 --> 01:09:00,273
I got more feelings now
than I ever had before.

915
01:09:00,356 --> 01:09:04,568
I've been reading a lot,
and doing yoga with this guy...

916
01:09:04,610 --> 01:09:06,696
but, he pissed me off.

917
01:09:08,572 --> 01:09:11,075
He's not around anymore.

918
01:09:11,159 --> 01:09:16,038
At night, I pretend
you're lying next to me.

919
01:09:16,123 --> 01:09:19,041
I lie in my cell...

920
01:09:19,083 --> 01:09:22,294
I imagine kissing you,
not making love,

921
01:09:22,379 --> 01:09:26,549
just kissing for hours
and hours on end.

922
01:09:27,591 --> 01:09:30,636
I remember everything
about our time.

923
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:34,140
I remember every secret
you ever shared.

924
01:09:34,224 --> 01:09:36,642
I remember every single time
you laughed...

925
01:09:38,853 --> 01:09:41,772
and your dancing,
oh, my God, your dancing.

926
01:09:43,899 --> 01:09:46,861
I lie on my bed
and go over every day,

927
01:09:46,944 --> 01:09:50,281
every minute of our happiness.

928
01:09:50,364 --> 01:09:52,534
I take it all as it comes,

929
01:09:52,616 --> 01:09:56,871
and I live that day again.

930
01:09:56,954 --> 01:10:00,499
That way, when I get
to our first kiss,

931
01:10:00,583 --> 01:10:03,544
they're not just memories.

932
01:10:03,627 --> 01:10:06,338
I feel that joy again."

933
01:10:07,882 --> 01:10:09,258
Dr. Reingold, are they insane?

934
01:10:12,678 --> 01:10:14,305
insane?

935
01:10:16,432 --> 01:10:17,893
...No.

936
01:10:18,392 --> 01:10:20,686
Psychotic... yes.

937
01:10:20,771 --> 01:10:24,315
it's right after the Super Bowl.
We've got 'em in their homes,

938
01:10:24,358 --> 01:10:27,943
the game has just sucked,
and they want to see this guy, Mickey.

939
01:10:28,028 --> 01:10:29,111
What's he like...?

940
01:10:29,154 --> 01:10:31,073
A country numb with violence...

941
01:10:31,155 --> 01:10:33,533
These guys want to tear
their wives' heads off!

942
01:10:33,616 --> 01:10:35,701
Yeah, but some of them...

943
01:10:35,785 --> 01:10:39,081
Mickey and Mallory
know the difference

944
01:10:39,163 --> 01:10:41,708
between right and wrong.

945
01:10:43,292 --> 01:10:45,503
They just don't give a damn.

946
01:10:45,586 --> 01:10:49,048
This will be the most talked about
event in television history!

947
01:10:49,131 --> 01:10:52,343
...they were sexually abused
as children, Dr. Reingold?

948
01:10:52,385 --> 01:10:54,513
I can't imagine.

949
01:10:54,553 --> 01:10:57,264
I don't think... that it's...

950
01:10:57,349 --> 01:11:00,267
I would say... no.

951
01:11:00,309 --> 01:11:03,771
When you suggested that I marry
your daughter after I got her pregnant,

952
01:11:03,855 --> 01:11:05,439
that's exactly what I did.

953
01:11:05,523 --> 01:11:07,608
Now, you listen to me...

954
01:11:07,693 --> 01:11:09,403
if you blow this,

955
01:11:09,443 --> 01:11:11,987
CBS will be eating your lunch
next season,

956
01:11:12,072 --> 01:11:15,157
and I'll be there with them,
'cause I'm out of here!

957
01:11:15,241 --> 01:11:17,660
I'm out!

958
01:11:17,743 --> 01:11:20,664
...Mallory Knox has said
that she does want to kill you.

959
01:11:20,705 --> 01:11:26,669
I never really believe
what women say to me.

960
01:11:26,753 --> 01:11:29,714
Margaret, darling, I don't know
what you think you found,

961
01:11:29,798 --> 01:11:31,883
but it's not
what you think it is.

962
01:11:31,966 --> 01:11:33,884
Just tell me who Ming is.

963
01:11:33,969 --> 01:11:35,594
"Ming"?
There's no "Ming".

964
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:37,263
That's a fuckin' restaurant!

965
01:11:37,346 --> 01:11:39,557
What do you mean
going through my drawers?

966
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:41,226
I don't go through your drawers.

967
01:11:41,308 --> 01:11:44,520
Davey, this looks like it was cut
with a fuckin' meat cleaver.

968
01:11:44,603 --> 01:11:46,023
And where's my close ups?

969
01:11:46,063 --> 01:11:47,690
Now, listen...
less of the shrink,

970
01:11:47,773 --> 01:11:49,567
keep the teens,
keep the longhairs...

971
01:11:49,651 --> 01:11:51,777
I love the cop
at the doughnut shop,

972
01:11:51,819 --> 01:11:53,447
and I love McClusky.

973
01:11:53,529 --> 01:11:56,741
Cut in on him in the middle
of that horrific fuckin' laugh.

974
01:11:56,824 --> 01:11:59,201
Freeze frame on him.
Don't even let him answer.

975
01:11:59,285 --> 01:12:01,079
Then, cut to me at the trial.

976
01:12:01,162 --> 01:12:02,747
"Their subsequent trial...

977
01:12:02,830 --> 01:12:05,791
turned into a sick,
pathetic circus.

978
01:12:05,875 --> 01:12:10,337
The nation caught Mickey
and Mallory fire."

979
01:12:10,422 --> 01:12:13,300
Mike Griffin is who these
misguided should be revering.

980
01:12:13,382 --> 01:12:16,385
Mike Jerome Griffin was killed
in the line of duty...

981
01:12:16,427 --> 01:12:19,680
by these suckling,
degenerate bags!

982
01:12:21,766 --> 01:12:24,018
We Want Mickey!
We Want Mallory!

983
01:12:25,770 --> 01:12:28,230
What do you think
of this turnout, Mallory?

984
01:12:28,315 --> 01:12:30,691
I've never had more fun in my life!

985
01:12:32,401 --> 01:12:34,613
Scumbag!

986
01:12:37,448 --> 01:12:41,035
Ming... Ming, first of all,
slow down. Speak English.

987
01:12:41,119 --> 01:12:43,496
Okay? You're paranoid.

988
01:12:43,580 --> 01:12:45,373
Nah, she's not on to us.

989
01:12:45,456 --> 01:12:48,626
I don't give a fuck
what the I Ching says!

990
01:12:48,709 --> 01:12:51,670
Just don't put anything
down on paper. Ever.

991
01:12:51,754 --> 01:12:54,423
if she calls back, you say,
"Hello, Ming Dynasty Restaurant...

992
01:12:54,466 --> 01:12:56,385
Number Five,
may I take your order?"

993
01:12:56,467 --> 01:12:58,886
What do you have to say
to your fans?

994
01:12:58,886 --> 01:13:01,306
You ain't seen nothin' yet.

995
01:13:09,980 --> 01:13:13,067
How the hell did you let
this show go live, Dwight?

996
01:13:13,151 --> 01:13:15,361
Couldn't help it,
just got out of hand.

997
01:13:15,403 --> 01:13:18,364
Doesn't change a thing, though.
Gonna move them in the morning,

998
01:13:18,406 --> 01:13:21,283
just a little bit
ahead of schedule, that's all.

999
01:13:21,325 --> 01:13:24,204
You know, Dwight, when I do
these two ratfucking douche bags,

1000
01:13:24,246 --> 01:13:26,707
I'll go right up there
with Jack Ruby, huh?

1001
01:13:26,789 --> 01:13:28,290
World famous, huh?

1002
01:13:28,374 --> 01:13:30,376
Hall of Fame.

1003
01:13:30,793 --> 01:13:33,713
You'll be bigger, Jack.
Lee Harvey Oswald was a pussy.

1004
01:13:33,796 --> 01:13:36,924
Oswald might have been a pussy,
but he was a great shot.

1005
01:13:37,008 --> 01:13:39,760
Do you hear it, Jack?

1006
01:13:39,802 --> 01:13:42,471
- Hear what?
- it's dead quiet.

1007
01:13:42,556 --> 01:13:44,641
it's dangerous
when it's dead quiet.

1008
01:14:33,898 --> 01:14:35,150
A- hem-

1009
01:14:35,192 --> 01:14:36,359
Okay.

1010
01:14:36,442 --> 01:14:39,695
Testing, one-two-three...
Wayne, don't blow this.

1011
01:14:39,779 --> 01:14:43,115
Hey, how goes it, brother?

1012
01:14:43,657 --> 01:14:46,660
Doing some hard time, huh?
What'd they get you for?

1013
01:14:46,744 --> 01:14:48,287
Murder.

1014
01:14:48,330 --> 01:14:52,083
Yeah, that's a rough one, there.
I'm with you.

1015
01:15:18,819 --> 01:15:20,737
Show time.

1016
01:15:20,778 --> 01:15:23,948
And Dallas, your Cowboys
are the Super Bowl Champions...

1017
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:26,492
Rlght after the game,
stay tuned for a special

1018
01:15:26,575 --> 01:15:29,412
"American Maniacs",
on W-A-T-C-H.

1019
01:15:29,496 --> 01:15:32,289
Mickey Knox is the most
dangerous man in America,

1020
01:15:32,374 --> 01:15:35,210
but Wayne Gale isn't afraid
to meet him, one on one,

1021
01:15:35,292 --> 01:15:37,129
to learn what 48 people died for.

1022
01:15:37,211 --> 01:15:40,840
is this man insane? Or does he belong
where he sent so many others-

1023
01:15:41,550 --> 01:15:43,175
...in the grave?

1024
01:15:43,802 --> 01:15:45,721
Mickey Knox,
thank you for this time.

1025
01:15:45,803 --> 01:15:49,014
I've got a few questions
to start with, if you don't mind?

1026
01:15:49,098 --> 01:15:51,684
Ahem-Well, that's really
nice, Wayne.

1027
01:15:51,767 --> 01:15:56,313
Mickey Knox, when did you
start thinking about killing?

1028
01:15:56,398 --> 01:16:01,945
Birth. I was thrown into a flaming
pit of scum forgotten by God.

1029
01:16:05,281 --> 01:16:06,991
What do you mean by that?

1030
01:16:07,075 --> 01:16:10,745
I mean, I came from violence,
it was in my blood.

1031
01:16:10,828 --> 01:16:13,080
My dad had it,
his dad had it.

1032
01:16:13,165 --> 01:16:15,791
- it's just my fate.
- Do you believe in fate, boy?

1033
01:16:15,834 --> 01:16:18,336
- My fate.
- No one is born evil, Mickey...

1034
01:16:18,419 --> 01:16:20,463
it's something you learn.

1035
01:16:20,546 --> 01:16:23,215
What about your father?
How did he die?

1036
01:16:26,761 --> 01:16:30,264
You were only 10 years old,
and there's a lot of speculation...

1037
01:16:31,348 --> 01:16:34,810
I didn't kill my father,
and I don't wanna talk about that shit.

1038
01:16:34,852 --> 01:16:37,271
Hey, hey...!
Watch it, watch it-

1039
01:16:37,355 --> 01:16:38,940
it's all right, it's okay...

1040
01:16:39,023 --> 01:16:40,733
it's okay.

1041
01:16:41,777 --> 01:16:43,944
Go on to something else, okay?

1042
01:16:44,028 --> 01:16:45,614
Please, let's do.

1043
01:16:45,696 --> 01:16:48,867
So, tell me, how can you look
at an ordinary person,

1044
01:16:48,949 --> 01:16:50,369
an innocent guy with kids,

1045
01:16:50,409 --> 01:16:52,871
and then, shoot him to death?

1046
01:16:52,953 --> 01:16:55,956
I mean, how can you
bring yourself to do that?

1047
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:58,377
innocent? Who's innocent,
Wayne? You?

1048
01:16:58,459 --> 01:17:01,587
I'm innocent, yes, I am.
Of murder, definitely.

1049
01:17:01,670 --> 01:17:05,091
it's just murder, man.
All of God's creatures do it,

1050
01:17:05,132 --> 01:17:08,135
some form or another,
I mean, you look in the forest...

1051
01:17:08,219 --> 01:17:10,137
you got species
killing other species.

1052
01:17:10,180 --> 01:17:13,266
Our is killin' all the species
including' the forest,

1053
01:17:13,349 --> 01:17:16,560
and we just call it
"industry", not murder.

1054
01:17:16,644 --> 01:17:21,023
But I know a lot of people
who deserve to die.

1055
01:17:23,109 --> 01:17:25,821
Why do they deserve to die?

1056
01:17:25,903 --> 01:17:28,907
I think everybody got
something in their past,

1057
01:17:28,989 --> 01:17:32,243
some sin, some awful,
secret thing.

1058
01:17:32,284 --> 01:17:34,996
A lot of people walking around
out there, already dead.

1059
01:17:35,079 --> 01:17:37,457
Just need to be
put out of their misery.

1060
01:17:39,417 --> 01:17:41,711
That's where I come in.
Fate's messenger.

1061
01:17:42,796 --> 01:17:45,882
"Except a corn of wheat
falleth to the ground and die,

1062
01:17:45,965 --> 01:17:51,262
it abideth alone. But if it die,
it bringeth forth much fruit."

1063
01:17:51,345 --> 01:17:56,100
Oh, the theory that "everyone
meets a serial killer halfway" thing?

1064
01:17:56,184 --> 01:17:57,560
Is that what you're saying?

1065
01:17:57,643 --> 01:18:00,604
The wolf don't know why he's a wolf,
the deer don't know why he's a deer.

1066
01:18:00,688 --> 01:18:02,274
God just made it that way.

1067
01:18:02,356 --> 01:18:04,151
You're saying the world itself
is predatory,

1068
01:18:04,233 --> 01:18:06,527
that when a mountain lion
takes down an elk,

1069
01:18:06,610 --> 01:18:08,404
it's because it's the
elk's time to go.

1070
01:18:08,487 --> 01:18:11,699
And all the b.s. liberal agenda
about saving the animal herds...

1071
01:18:11,783 --> 01:18:15,661
only serves to overpopulate
the balance of nature.

1072
01:18:15,745 --> 01:18:17,872
Maybe you're right, Mickey.
I don't think so,

1073
01:18:17,955 --> 01:18:19,957
but maybe you're right.
Corporate predators...

1074
01:18:20,041 --> 01:18:22,461
environmental predators,
nuclear predators.

1075
01:18:22,543 --> 01:18:25,463
Life is a hunt.
I've seen it. I was there.

1076
01:18:25,547 --> 01:18:27,757
When the
hit the fan at Grenada,

1077
01:18:27,841 --> 01:18:30,801
I saw it all go down at Grenada.

1078
01:18:34,930 --> 01:18:38,017
So tell me, Mickey,
any regrets?

1079
01:18:38,101 --> 01:18:42,563
Three weeks, 50 people killed.
Not too cool, Mickey.

1080
01:18:42,646 --> 01:18:45,649
52, but I don't spend
a lot of time with regret.

1081
01:18:45,734 --> 01:18:47,526
That's a wasted emotion.

1082
01:18:47,610 --> 01:18:50,113
Seriously, you must have
some regret. Rack your brain.

1083
01:18:50,196 --> 01:18:52,824
Well, I wish that indian
hadn't got killed.

1084
01:18:52,865 --> 01:18:55,785
Bad, bad, bad
bad, bad!

1085
01:18:57,788 --> 01:19:00,248
One of your last victims.

1086
01:19:00,331 --> 01:19:03,502
Man had a rattlesnake
sitting' in the corner.

1087
01:19:03,584 --> 01:19:05,669
A rattlesnake?

1088
01:19:05,754 --> 01:19:09,007
Could pick it up, pet it.

1089
01:19:09,048 --> 01:19:10,591
He saw it.

1090
01:19:10,674 --> 01:19:12,343
He saw what?

1091
01:19:12,927 --> 01:19:15,054
The demon.
He saw the demon.

1092
01:19:15,138 --> 01:19:16,972
The demon?

1093
01:19:17,056 --> 01:19:18,474
What demon?

1094
01:19:18,516 --> 01:19:20,309
Everybody got the demon
in here, okay?

1095
01:19:20,393 --> 01:19:24,772
The demon lives in here.
it feeds on your hate.

1096
01:19:24,856 --> 01:19:26,566
Cuts, kills, rapes...

1097
01:19:26,649 --> 01:19:30,277
it uses your weakness, your fears.
Only the vicious survive.

1098
01:19:30,362 --> 01:19:31,779
All right, you tell 'em.

1099
01:19:31,821 --> 01:19:35,574
We're told we're no good pieces of shit
from the time we could breathe.

1100
01:19:35,658 --> 01:19:37,743
After a while,
you kind of become bad.

1101
01:19:39,412 --> 01:19:42,164
After the indian
we were gonna quit killin'.

1102
01:19:42,248 --> 01:19:44,417
The old man
took it out of us.

1103
01:19:44,459 --> 01:19:48,254
- What happened?
- it was just a mistake, you know...

1104
01:19:48,296 --> 01:19:51,590
Man was tryin' to help us,
you know, pet us.

1105
01:19:51,674 --> 01:19:54,635
Same dream I've had
since I was a kid, I guess.

1106
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:59,598
I was just runnin' with the animals
in the darkness.

1107
01:19:59,682 --> 01:20:03,602
Mr. Rabbit, bloody fangs,

1108
01:20:03,686 --> 01:20:07,023
Christmas hat...

1109
01:20:07,106 --> 01:20:09,860
little, uh...

1110
01:20:09,942 --> 01:20:12,696
madness going on and I don't know,
we're just runnin'...

1111
01:20:12,778 --> 01:20:14,739
and I'm just...

1112
01:20:14,823 --> 01:20:19,745
I'm Mr. Rabbit. I'm eating'
every other animal in the forest.

1113
01:20:19,827 --> 01:20:24,248
Death, just-death
kinda becomes what you are.

1114
01:20:24,290 --> 01:20:26,793
After a while,
you begin to like it.

1115
01:20:26,876 --> 01:20:32,716
You know about realization?
I mean, all this, is just illusion.

1116
01:20:34,341 --> 01:20:37,928
Mr. Rabbit says,
"the moment of realization...

1117
01:20:38,012 --> 01:20:41,474
the moment of realization...
is worth...

1118
01:20:41,557 --> 01:20:44,894
a thousand prayers."

1119
01:20:44,977 --> 01:20:46,438
You're crazy, mate.

1120
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:49,023
I don't think I'm any crazier
than you are.

1121
01:20:49,107 --> 01:20:51,985
I'm extremes, dark and light.
You know that.

1122
01:20:52,068 --> 01:20:55,822
I'm light with Mal.
Mal... Mal.

1123
01:20:57,532 --> 01:21:00,369
That's your shadow on the wall,
you know.

1124
01:21:02,161 --> 01:21:03,246
You can't get rid of your shadow,
can you, Wayne?

1125
01:21:15,383 --> 01:21:19,762
Now, you know, the only thing
that kills a demon?

1126
01:21:19,804 --> 01:21:21,222
Love.

1127
01:21:22,682 --> 01:21:24,642
That's why I know
Mallory's my salvation.

1128
01:21:24,725 --> 01:21:26,644
She was teaching me
how to love.

1129
01:21:26,686 --> 01:21:28,896
I forgive you, baby.

1130
01:21:28,980 --> 01:21:32,900
Yeah, it was just like...
being in the Garden of Eden.

1131
01:21:35,070 --> 01:21:38,614
"Only love...
can kill the demon."

1132
01:21:38,699 --> 01:21:40,574
Hold that thought.

1133
01:21:58,217 --> 01:22:01,137
Are these guys
in your eye line? I'm sorry, man.

1134
01:22:01,221 --> 01:22:03,724
You want some powder?
Do you want some powder?

1135
01:22:20,156 --> 01:22:24,452
Rise and shine, Mallory.
Turn around and face the wall.

1136
01:22:24,535 --> 01:22:27,204
Relax, fellas.
We wanna have a little talk, is all.

1137
01:22:27,288 --> 01:22:29,415
Mr. Scagnetti, don't get close to her.
She'll kill you.

1138
01:22:29,498 --> 01:22:31,459
One way or the other,
she'll kill you.

1139
01:22:31,543 --> 01:22:34,628
Relax. Read my book, okay?
I've met women who were crocodiles,

1140
01:22:34,670 --> 01:22:35,880
but this little lady...

1141
01:22:35,963 --> 01:22:38,425
I think she's got
a sweet streak for me.

1142
01:22:38,507 --> 01:22:40,510
Here, y'all take that.
it's okay. Come on.

1143
01:22:40,593 --> 01:22:42,928
- Sir, we're not allowed.
- That's okay. Come on.

1144
01:22:43,013 --> 01:22:45,098
it's okay, guys.

1145
01:22:47,308 --> 01:22:49,644
Smoke?

1146
01:22:49,727 --> 01:22:52,356
I know you smoke.

1147
01:22:52,438 --> 01:22:54,441
I'm not here to hurt you, Mallory.

1148
01:22:54,523 --> 01:22:56,400
I want to be
your friend, okay?

1149
01:22:57,652 --> 01:23:00,571
if I ever met a girl
who needs a friend...

1150
01:23:00,613 --> 01:23:02,198
it's you.

1151
01:23:03,532 --> 01:23:06,036
You're a very pretty girl.

1152
01:23:06,118 --> 01:23:08,621
Remember the last time
you got fucked? Huh?

1153
01:23:09,372 --> 01:23:10,832
Remember?

1154
01:23:10,915 --> 01:23:13,502
What I want you to do
is close your eyes...

1155
01:23:13,542 --> 01:23:17,004
and remember the last time
ol' Mickey gave you the high hard one.

1156
01:23:17,088 --> 01:23:18,339
Thinking' about it?

1157
01:23:20,342 --> 01:23:22,927
Don't forget it,
'cause it's never gonna happen again.

1158
01:23:23,011 --> 01:23:25,347
When they get through with
all that electroshock shit

1159
01:23:25,429 --> 01:23:27,348
they got lined up
for that cocksucker,

1160
01:23:27,390 --> 01:23:30,268
ol' Mickey
ain't gonna be worth a shit.

1161
01:23:51,330 --> 01:23:54,166
- And was it really worth it?
- Was what worth it?

1162
01:23:54,250 --> 01:23:57,044
Was massacring all those people
worth being separated

1163
01:23:57,128 --> 01:24:00,215
from your love
for the rest of your life?

1164
01:24:00,256 --> 01:24:04,677
You mean, was an instant of my purity
worth a lifetime of your lies?

1165
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:07,596
Please explain, where is the purity
that you couldn't live without

1166
01:24:07,681 --> 01:24:10,975
in the 52 people
who are no longer on this planet,

1167
01:24:11,058 --> 01:24:12,935
because they met you and Mallory!?

1168
01:24:13,019 --> 01:24:16,231
What's so pure about that?
How do you do it?

1169
01:24:16,313 --> 01:24:20,484
You'll never understand. You and me,
we're not even the same species.

1170
01:24:20,568 --> 01:24:23,113
I used to be you,
then I evolved.

1171
01:24:23,195 --> 01:24:25,239
From where you're standing,
you're a man.

1172
01:24:25,322 --> 01:24:28,576
From where I'm standing,
you're an ape.

1173
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:31,121
You're not even an ape,
you're a media person.

1174
01:24:32,371 --> 01:24:35,833
Media's like the weather,
only its man made weather.

1175
01:24:35,916 --> 01:24:38,461
Murder? it's pure.

1176
01:24:38,545 --> 01:24:40,880
You're the one
that made it impure.

1177
01:24:40,963 --> 01:24:44,259
You're buyin' and sellin' fear.

1178
01:24:44,341 --> 01:24:47,970
You say, "why?"
I say, "why bother?"

1179
01:24:49,138 --> 01:24:53,392
Are you done? Great.
Now let's cut the b.s. and get real.

1180
01:24:53,476 --> 01:24:55,978
Why this purity that you feel
about killing?

1181
01:24:56,062 --> 01:24:58,814
Why, for Christ sake, why?
Don't lie to me!

1182
01:24:58,898 --> 01:25:02,944
I guess, Wayne, you gotta hold
that ol' shotgun in your hand...

1183
01:25:03,027 --> 01:25:06,697
and it becomes clear,
like it did for me the first time.

1184
01:25:06,739 --> 01:25:10,117
That's when I realized
my one true calling in life.

1185
01:25:10,159 --> 01:25:11,786
And what's that, Mickey?

1186
01:25:12,578 --> 01:25:14,538
Shit, man...

1187
01:25:14,581 --> 01:25:17,084
I'm a natural born killer.

1188
01:25:18,334 --> 01:25:21,170
And... commercial. Two minutes, guys.

1189
01:25:21,212 --> 01:25:22,422
Did you get that?

1190
01:25:22,505 --> 01:25:24,465
All right, Mickey!

1191
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:38,605
Great. Great, man.

1192
01:25:40,481 --> 01:25:41,274
Hello, Wurlitzer here.

1193
01:25:41,316 --> 01:25:43,526
We got a riot in B wing.

1194
01:25:43,610 --> 01:25:44,568
Oh, shit.

1195
01:25:44,652 --> 01:25:46,779
Thanks.

1196
01:25:47,363 --> 01:25:50,783
Every fuckin' moron
in the world just saw that, mate.

1197
01:25:50,826 --> 01:25:54,328
Warden, we got a riot
going on and it's out of control.

1198
01:25:54,412 --> 01:25:57,790
- We need help.
- God Almighty, shitfire! Where at?

1199
01:25:57,874 --> 01:25:59,375
in the rec room, B wing.

1200
01:25:59,458 --> 01:26:01,085
We're outmanned already.
We need help.

1201
01:26:01,168 --> 01:26:04,548
All right. You mobilize the men,
I'm on my way.

1202
01:26:05,631 --> 01:26:09,635
Mr. Gale, close them cameras down.
We got a riot in B wing.

1203
01:26:09,677 --> 01:26:12,096
Just a sec, we have to finish.
We're live-!

1204
01:26:12,180 --> 01:26:15,058
You sure as hell are finished!
They got guns, hostages, explosives.

1205
01:26:15,141 --> 01:26:17,184
Close that camera down, now!
Turn 'em off!

1206
01:26:17,268 --> 01:26:19,729
We'll never get this chance again!
We'll be famous!

1207
01:26:19,770 --> 01:26:23,315
You stay here and shut up.
I gotta find out what's going on

1208
01:26:23,357 --> 01:26:25,484
before I can let you
film anywhere.

1209
01:26:26,444 --> 01:26:29,573
The whole world is watching!
We'll never get this chance again!

1210
01:26:29,655 --> 01:26:33,368
This asshole is trying to tell me
what I'm gonna do in my jail!

1211
01:26:33,451 --> 01:26:36,120
Fuck him! This fuck don't know
what he's dealing with,

1212
01:26:36,204 --> 01:26:39,415
but we do. Keep your fingers
on the triggers of your shotguns,

1213
01:26:39,498 --> 01:26:41,208
and follow me.

1214
01:27:04,441 --> 01:27:06,943
This is a tough room.
All right, one more.

1215
01:27:09,237 --> 01:27:10,780
Mother says to Sister,

1216
01:27:10,821 --> 01:27:15,911
"You can go out with Bobby,
but you got to take little Johnny."

1217
01:27:15,993 --> 01:27:18,245
Sister goes, "Okay."

1218
01:27:19,873 --> 01:27:21,832
So they go, they come back,

1219
01:27:21,916 --> 01:27:24,377
Mother grabs little Johnny aside,
says, "All right, now...

1220
01:27:24,418 --> 01:27:27,130
what happened?"
Little Johnny can't talk.

1221
01:27:29,298 --> 01:27:31,551
Mother says,
"They went to the drive-in,

1222
01:27:31,592 --> 01:27:33,761
I know that, what happened then?"

1223
01:27:33,804 --> 01:27:35,054
Little Johnny goes...

1224
01:27:36,931 --> 01:27:40,310
"Oh, they were kissing'!
What else?"

1225
01:27:40,393 --> 01:27:42,895
You heard this one?

1226
01:27:42,979 --> 01:27:44,397
"What else?"

1227
01:27:44,438 --> 01:27:46,107
Little Johnny goes...

1228
01:27:49,026 --> 01:27:51,862
"He felt her up?

1229
01:27:51,947 --> 01:27:53,073
Well..."

1230
01:27:53,155 --> 01:27:55,282
Little Johnny goes...

1231
01:27:56,535 --> 01:27:58,578
"They took off their clothes?"

1232
01:27:58,661 --> 01:28:00,914
"Well, what else?"

1233
01:28:00,955 --> 01:28:02,665
Little Johnny goes...

1234
01:28:03,416 --> 01:28:06,502
"They did that?
What the hell were you doin'?"

1235
01:28:06,586 --> 01:28:08,212
Little Johnny goes...

1236
01:28:09,588 --> 01:28:12,049
"Little Johnny, no!"

1237
01:28:13,634 --> 01:28:15,136
Oh... shit!

1238
01:28:38,534 --> 01:28:40,579
Drop it!

1239
01:28:40,661 --> 01:28:42,997
The gun, goddamn it!

1240
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:45,917
Smart move.
Okay, empty the shells.

1241
01:28:47,627 --> 01:28:49,086
Hurry it up!

1242
01:28:51,672 --> 01:28:53,508
Everybody, raise your hands!

1243
01:28:53,591 --> 01:28:55,718
You think you're gettin'
out of here, boy?

1244
01:28:55,802 --> 01:28:59,013
They're gonna mop you up.
They're gonna put you in a bucket.

1245
01:29:01,265 --> 01:29:04,143
Kavanaugh, you're the law.
I'm the law breaker.

1246
01:29:04,227 --> 01:29:06,395
Oh, you motherfucker!

1247
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:09,398
Wayne, where are you?

1248
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:11,942
Hey, I'm all right, man.
I'm okay, I'm okay.

1249
01:29:12,027 --> 01:29:14,737
All right, new friend.
Get your camera.

1250
01:29:14,820 --> 01:29:15,780
Where's Roger?

1251
01:29:15,864 --> 01:29:16,906
I'm right here.

1252
01:29:16,990 --> 01:29:19,784
- Where's Scotty?
- He's hit. I think he's dead.

1253
01:29:19,868 --> 01:29:21,452
Aw, shit.

1254
01:29:21,536 --> 01:29:23,621
Put the shells on the table!

1255
01:29:25,247 --> 01:29:26,832
Drop your belt!

1256
01:29:26,917 --> 01:29:29,335
Hands behind your head!

1257
01:29:29,418 --> 01:29:32,255
- Got that camera going yet?
- They're both shot to shit.

1258
01:29:32,338 --> 01:29:34,716
- Well, that's too bad for you-
- N-no, wait!

1259
01:29:34,716 --> 01:29:37,843
I got a shoulder pack
with remote Beta on it.

1260
01:29:37,927 --> 01:29:39,595
- I can get an image off of that.
- Very innovative.

1261
01:29:39,637 --> 01:29:41,430
Put it on your shoulder.
Let's go.

1262
01:29:41,514 --> 01:29:43,475
We're gonna play "Follow the Leader'.
Everybody follow me out.

1263
01:29:43,557 --> 01:29:47,144
One big, happy family.
Shooting everything I do.

1264
01:29:47,228 --> 01:29:49,939
Kavanaugh, get up!

1265
01:29:50,022 --> 01:29:53,275
Take me to Mallory's cell,
and you hope she's in one place.

1266
01:29:53,359 --> 01:29:57,363
Everybody, get behind Kavanaugh.
Press up against his back.

1267
01:29:57,446 --> 01:30:00,616
Let's go! Young lady,
you want to come along with us?

1268
01:30:01,158 --> 01:30:04,496
Come on, darlin', get up.
Go, go, go! Come on.

1269
01:30:04,578 --> 01:30:06,872
You got the keys?

1270
01:30:06,957 --> 01:30:08,249
Come on, hustle it!

1271
01:30:15,589 --> 01:30:18,009
Stay with me!

1272
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:24,891
Come on, assholes!

1273
01:30:46,912 --> 01:30:49,415
That's my camera,
you motherfucker!

1274
01:30:49,499 --> 01:30:51,292
Come on, stick together!

1275
01:30:53,961 --> 01:30:57,548
Oh, now I remember you.

1276
01:30:57,631 --> 01:30:59,717
You're Jack.

1277
01:31:04,597 --> 01:31:07,809
I'm not really as bad
as they say I am.

1278
01:31:07,850 --> 01:31:10,812
I'm actually a really nice person.

1279
01:31:14,274 --> 01:31:16,151
Yeah, I know.

1280
01:31:16,233 --> 01:31:18,445
I've done some pretty
bad things myself.

1281
01:31:19,153 --> 01:31:21,030
I killed somebody.

1282
01:31:27,245 --> 01:31:29,331
No shit.

1283
01:31:30,915 --> 01:31:32,500
Anyway...

1284
01:31:32,584 --> 01:31:35,127
You know what I think about?

1285
01:31:35,211 --> 01:31:38,465
Sex.

1286
01:31:38,547 --> 01:31:40,633
Fuckin'.

1287
01:31:44,470 --> 01:31:49,475
I think about hands on my tits.

1288
01:31:49,559 --> 01:31:52,520
And I think about flesh...

1289
01:31:52,604 --> 01:31:55,940
flesh...
and sweat.

1290
01:31:57,150 --> 01:31:59,861
My mind drives me crazy.

1291
01:32:02,155 --> 01:32:04,323
Sit down.

1292
01:32:09,537 --> 01:32:11,914
What do you want me to do?

1293
01:32:11,997 --> 01:32:15,960
I want you to kiss me
and squeeze my nipple.

1294
01:32:16,044 --> 01:32:19,630
Oh, you're so specific.

1295
01:32:19,715 --> 01:32:21,216
Squeeze it-

1296
01:32:21,298 --> 01:32:23,301
You like a little bit of pain?

1297
01:32:23,384 --> 01:32:25,886
Harder... ow!

1298
01:32:40,443 --> 01:32:42,946
How sexy am I now, fucker?

1299
01:32:43,863 --> 01:32:45,407
You stupid dick!

1300
01:32:45,489 --> 01:32:48,576
Aw, shit! Shit!
Carl, what happened?

1301
01:32:48,660 --> 01:32:50,911
You whore!

1302
01:32:50,995 --> 01:32:53,956
You want a sexy little whore?!

1303
01:32:55,458 --> 01:32:57,419
I'm trying, I'm trying!

1304
01:33:08,722 --> 01:33:11,933
Fucking bitch broke my fucking nose!
Give me that gun!

1305
01:33:13,225 --> 01:33:15,227
I'll kill you!
I'll fuckin' kill you!

1306
01:33:15,311 --> 01:33:18,231
- Whoa! No gun! Put it away!
- Give me your fucking mace!

1307
01:33:18,314 --> 01:33:21,025
You fucking whore!
So, you wanna play, bitch?

1308
01:33:21,109 --> 01:33:23,195
You want some? How about this?

1309
01:33:26,448 --> 01:33:28,158
Get down!

1310
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:30,035
I told you I liked you!

1311
01:33:44,341 --> 01:33:46,717
And now, a special report
from Channel Six News.

1312
01:33:46,759 --> 01:33:48,677
We're on the air...!
Are we on?

1313
01:33:48,762 --> 01:33:51,305
Good afternoon, I'm Antonia Chavez...

1314
01:33:51,390 --> 01:33:53,641
this is a WATCH special report.

1315
01:33:53,725 --> 01:33:57,478
I'm being told that we're taking
you live to Batongo Penitentiary,

1316
01:33:57,561 --> 01:34:00,648
where Wayne Gale continues
his interrupted interview

1317
01:34:00,732 --> 01:34:02,942
in the middle of a full scale riot.

1318
01:34:03,026 --> 01:34:05,653
Wayne, can you hear me?
Wayne, tell us what's happening.

1319
01:34:05,737 --> 01:34:08,198
Are you safe?

1320
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:11,492
This is Wayne Gale,
resuming live from Batongovllle,

1321
01:34:11,534 --> 01:34:14,370
where you can tell by the blood
and carnage around me,

1322
01:34:14,453 --> 01:34:16,247
that the final chapter
in the book...

1323
01:34:16,330 --> 01:34:18,709
called, "Mickey and Mallory",
has yet to be written!

1324
01:34:18,749 --> 01:34:22,211
Are you in danger, Wayne?
Can you tell us, are you in danger?

1325
01:34:22,295 --> 01:34:25,965
War has broken out here
unlike anything I've ever seen!

1326
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:29,720
Batongo will stand alongside-

1327
01:34:29,802 --> 01:34:31,220
What's happening, Wayne?

1328
01:34:31,263 --> 01:34:33,055
Batongo... Batongo...

1329
01:34:33,139 --> 01:34:36,183
Batongo, Batongo!
in Batongovllle!

1330
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:40,605
I thought you liked me!

1331
01:34:40,688 --> 01:34:43,232
Hey, Jack...
Mickey's back!

1332
01:34:53,492 --> 01:34:55,369
Drop the shotgun!

1333
01:34:57,621 --> 01:34:59,999
Looks like we got us
a Mexican standoff.

1334
01:35:00,083 --> 01:35:02,501
We've had this date
from the beginning, huh, Mickey?

1335
01:35:02,585 --> 01:35:04,170
Now, slide that shotgun over here.

1336
01:35:04,211 --> 01:35:07,381
Put your hands behind your head
and your forehead on the floor!

1337
01:35:07,423 --> 01:35:08,842
Or-what? You'll wound me?

1338
01:35:08,924 --> 01:35:11,552
I could blow you in half,
and you know it.

1339
01:35:11,635 --> 01:35:14,096
I never wounded anything in my life!

1340
01:35:14,138 --> 01:35:16,599
I got you locked
right between the eyes, Mickey!

1341
01:35:16,683 --> 01:35:19,393
I've had you locked
from the jump, you phony!

1342
01:35:19,477 --> 01:35:21,687
You got me locked,
you take your shot.

1343
01:35:30,071 --> 01:35:33,075
Okay, Jack. You win.

1344
01:35:47,254 --> 01:35:49,423
Oh, baby!

1345
01:35:50,425 --> 01:35:52,009
Ladles and gentlemen, this kiss...

1346
01:35:52,051 --> 01:35:53,928
...has been a year in the coming.

1347
01:35:54,012 --> 01:35:56,890
They're doing something everyone said
they would never do again.

1348
01:35:56,931 --> 01:36:00,685
At this moment, they are
the only two people on earth.

1349
01:36:19,037 --> 01:36:20,996
Shut up, Jack!

1350
01:36:30,506 --> 01:36:32,091
You're losing your touch, Jack.

1351
01:36:32,175 --> 01:36:34,261
I was out of shells.

1352
01:36:42,893 --> 01:36:44,603
You still like me now, Jack?

1353
01:36:46,230 --> 01:36:47,773
Die!

1354
01:36:56,157 --> 01:36:57,951
- What's this?
- The list of prisoners!

1355
01:36:58,034 --> 01:37:00,286
What the fuck do I want that for?
I asked for a list of hostages!

1356
01:37:00,369 --> 01:37:02,289
Hostages?
How am I supposed to know?

1357
01:37:02,371 --> 01:37:04,874
Just get it.
Do I have to do everything?

1358
01:37:04,915 --> 01:37:06,293
I'm working on it!

1359
01:37:12,923 --> 01:37:15,551
All right... Jesus Christ.

1360
01:37:15,635 --> 01:37:17,803
What are those guys right there?

1361
01:37:17,887 --> 01:37:20,264
Track it, track it!
Close one, two, three again.

1362
01:37:20,347 --> 01:37:22,475
- Still jammed open, sir.
- Well, jam 'em shut!

1363
01:37:22,517 --> 01:37:25,937
- There's a fire at Five Six North.
- I can see the goddamn fire!

1364
01:37:26,020 --> 01:37:29,608
The psych unit looks like a zoo,
informants are being tortured-

1365
01:37:35,363 --> 01:37:38,282
Hey Mabel, come here. Look at this.

1366
01:38:40,721 --> 01:38:41,680
Warden!

1367
01:38:41,762 --> 01:38:43,765
- Yes, what is it, Natapundi?
- Napalatoni.

1368
01:38:43,848 --> 01:38:46,016
I don't care
what your fuckin' name is!

1369
01:38:46,100 --> 01:38:49,186
Mickey and Mallory Knox are loose.

1370
01:38:49,271 --> 01:38:51,731
Scagnetti's dead!

1371
01:38:51,814 --> 01:38:54,942
And-we're live
on network TV.

1372
01:38:55,027 --> 01:38:58,071
Live on network TV?!

1373
01:38:58,154 --> 01:39:01,700
Jesus Harold Christ
on a fucking rubber crutch!

1374
01:39:01,741 --> 01:39:04,869
Is this happening to me?!

1375
01:40:13,312 --> 01:40:15,815
You fucking sick motherfuckers!

1376
01:40:30,205 --> 01:40:33,082
Come on.
Yeah, come on.

1377
01:40:34,543 --> 01:40:36,210
Come on.

1378
01:40:36,294 --> 01:40:38,295
Come on, Mickey.

1379
01:40:38,380 --> 01:40:40,131
This way.

1380
01:40:50,559 --> 01:40:52,601
Who are you?

1381
01:40:52,686 --> 01:40:54,687
My name's Owen.

1382
01:40:54,771 --> 01:40:56,898
What the hell
do you want from us?

1383
01:40:56,981 --> 01:40:59,316
I want you
to take me with you.

1384
01:40:59,359 --> 01:41:01,653
Where the hell are we?

1385
01:41:01,694 --> 01:41:05,156
it's a place I come to think
when things get hectic.

1386
01:41:05,197 --> 01:41:07,200
Follow me.

1387
01:41:08,826 --> 01:41:11,620
Let's go, Kavanaugh.

1388
01:41:11,704 --> 01:41:12,830
Follow me.

1389
01:41:12,914 --> 01:41:15,499
Now we're in B wing.
Where we goin,' Owen?

1390
01:41:15,584 --> 01:41:18,420
Out... through...
down.

1391
01:41:18,502 --> 01:41:21,422
Hold up!

1392
01:41:21,465 --> 01:41:23,090
Okay, Kavanaugh...

1393
01:41:23,175 --> 01:41:25,718
Don't shoot!

1394
01:41:28,138 --> 01:41:30,514
Motherfuckers!

1395
01:41:30,598 --> 01:41:32,433
How you doin', Wayne?

1396
01:41:32,517 --> 01:41:34,227
I'm fuckin' great!

1397
01:41:34,310 --> 01:41:35,604
You got the feelin'?

1398
01:41:35,686 --> 01:41:38,356
I'm alive for the
first fuckin' time in my life.

1399
01:41:38,440 --> 01:41:40,316
Thanks to Mickey!

1400
01:41:40,399 --> 01:41:42,819
Let's kill all these motherfuckers!

1401
01:41:42,902 --> 01:41:44,278
- Gimme that.
- Why?

1402
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:45,946
You're not centered, Wayne.

1403
01:41:46,030 --> 01:41:48,533
Here, shoot with this.

1404
01:41:48,616 --> 01:41:52,828
Okay, let's go.
Kavanaugh, stop slackin' off.

1405
01:42:08,220 --> 01:42:10,346
End of the line, Knox.
Drop 'em.

1406
01:42:10,388 --> 01:42:13,183
One move, and he's dead!

1407
01:42:13,265 --> 01:42:16,644
He's already dead, dickweed!

1408
01:42:16,727 --> 01:42:18,855
You got shit!

1409
01:42:18,938 --> 01:42:20,356
Fire!

1410
01:42:24,652 --> 01:42:26,697
Back off!

1411
01:42:26,779 --> 01:42:29,031
I'll blast him!
Back off!

1412
01:42:29,115 --> 01:42:31,617
Shut up, Gale, you prick!

1413
01:42:31,701 --> 01:42:34,162
Mickey, Mallory,
just let me say-

1414
01:42:34,245 --> 01:42:36,205
Put your hand up!

1415
01:42:39,750 --> 01:42:41,962
You see?

1416
01:42:42,044 --> 01:42:43,754
Now shut up!

1417
01:42:43,839 --> 01:42:46,382
Mickey, I made a place.
Come, come!

1418
01:42:46,465 --> 01:42:48,468
Let's go, Mal!

1419
01:42:54,349 --> 01:42:57,602
60 seconds,
and I'm coming up!

1420
01:43:09,406 --> 01:43:12,075
Think, think, think...

1421
01:43:13,701 --> 01:43:15,036
Fuck.

1422
01:43:17,538 --> 01:43:21,125
Yes...?

1423
01:43:21,208 --> 01:43:22,501
Hello, Margaret.

1424
01:43:22,543 --> 01:43:25,379
How you doin', Mal?

1425
01:43:25,464 --> 01:43:27,423
I'm all right.

1426
01:43:27,507 --> 01:43:29,634
You done good, baby.

1427
01:43:29,717 --> 01:43:31,594
Thank you.

1428
01:43:31,677 --> 01:43:35,097
I want you to know...
no matter what happens,

1429
01:43:35,182 --> 01:43:37,600
I love you.

1430
01:43:49,570 --> 01:43:52,948
I love you more
than I ever loved myself.

1431
01:43:53,032 --> 01:43:55,242
I know that, Mickey.

1432
01:43:55,326 --> 01:43:57,370
I'm never comin' home.

1433
01:43:57,454 --> 01:43:59,080
Don't you get it?
I'm alive,

1434
01:43:59,163 --> 01:44:02,708
for the first fucking time
in my life, I'm alive!

1435
01:44:03,292 --> 01:44:05,670
Because I don't love you anymore.

1436
01:44:05,753 --> 01:44:07,713
I love Ming.

1437
01:44:07,798 --> 01:44:11,258
That's right, Ming is not
a fucking restaurant!

1438
01:44:11,342 --> 01:44:14,178
I don't care, take the money!
it's all yours, anyway!

1439
01:44:14,262 --> 01:44:16,390
And one more thing,
piss off, you cunt!

1440
01:44:16,430 --> 01:44:20,394
it's good to be with you, Wayne.
You do a lot of good for people.

1441
01:44:21,394 --> 01:44:23,980
The fuckin' jail is exposed,
and you're dealing with these two...

1442
01:44:24,063 --> 01:44:26,148
when we've got
more important things to do!

1443
01:44:26,232 --> 01:44:29,610
These two-these are the ones,
they die today, you hear me, Sparky?

1444
01:44:29,695 --> 01:44:33,280
I'm gonna wipe that scum
off the face of the fucking earth,

1445
01:44:33,364 --> 01:44:36,201
if it's the last
fucking thing I do!

1446
01:44:37,410 --> 01:44:39,495
You know what I say?

1447
01:44:39,578 --> 01:44:43,541
I say, to hell
with going back to our cells.

1448
01:44:43,625 --> 01:44:47,753
Let's go out there,
and run down the stairs,

1449
01:44:47,838 --> 01:44:50,756
and go out in a hall of bullets.

1450
01:44:50,798 --> 01:44:53,217
And then we'll die,

1451
01:44:53,300 --> 01:44:55,678
and then we'll really be free.

1452
01:44:56,846 --> 01:44:58,806
That's poetry.

1453
01:45:00,141 --> 01:45:02,894
But we'll do that
when all else falls.

1454
01:45:02,977 --> 01:45:04,895
I just left her.
That's right.

1455
01:45:04,980 --> 01:45:07,940
Put a bottle of Dom on ice,
and get some Ecstasy,

1456
01:45:07,982 --> 01:45:11,402
I'm gonna come over tonight,
and put a hot pepper up your arse...

1457
01:45:11,486 --> 01:45:12,737
No, you're not.

1458
01:45:12,779 --> 01:45:16,074
I love you, Ming... Ming...?

1459
01:45:16,157 --> 01:45:17,908
Ming!

1460
01:45:19,994 --> 01:45:23,414
Duncan-Duncan,
hold this.

1461
01:45:23,456 --> 01:45:24,791
Are you married?

1462
01:45:24,833 --> 01:45:27,626
I don't wanna die,
I don't wanna die-

1463
01:45:29,086 --> 01:45:31,047
That wasn't the question.
Are you married?

1464
01:45:31,089 --> 01:45:32,632
Yes, I'm married.

1465
01:45:32,715 --> 01:45:36,094
- Do you have children?
- I have a boy... and a girl-

1466
01:45:36,177 --> 01:45:39,555
- I don't wanna die...
- Mal, could you come here, please?

1467
01:45:41,515 --> 01:45:44,143
The only way we're gonna get
out that front door,

1468
01:45:44,226 --> 01:45:47,938
is if they don't wanna kill
you two more than they wanna kill us.

1469
01:45:47,980 --> 01:45:50,107
Respected Journalist!

1470
01:45:54,363 --> 01:45:56,155
Hold that.

1471
01:45:56,238 --> 01:45:59,075
Duncan-Duncan Homolka,
Wayne Gale.

1472
01:46:00,451 --> 01:46:03,372
You wanted reality?
You got it.

1473
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:08,626
My name is Wayne Gale!
I am the star of "American Maniacs",

1474
01:46:08,710 --> 01:46:10,754
watched by 40 million
people a week!

1475
01:46:10,836 --> 01:46:14,173
I am a respected journalist,
winner of the Murrow

1476
01:46:14,256 --> 01:46:17,593
and the Golden Globe Award,
to name a few!

1477
01:46:17,676 --> 01:46:20,096
I have been shot,
you are on camera!

1478
01:46:20,179 --> 01:46:23,725
We are live. if anybody tries
to fuck up our escape,

1479
01:46:23,808 --> 01:46:25,601
I will make it my life's mission,

1480
01:46:25,684 --> 01:46:27,812
to put Dwight McClusky
out of commission!

1481
01:46:27,895 --> 01:46:31,899
I will do expose after expose,
revealing the inhumanity,

1482
01:46:31,982 --> 01:46:34,069
the brutality of the conditions
that exist here.

1483
01:46:34,151 --> 01:46:36,028
You! Back up, back up!

1484
01:46:36,070 --> 01:46:40,282
My name is Wayne Gale! I am the star
of "American Maniacs"-!

1485
01:46:40,367 --> 01:46:43,661
You're all on camera!
We are live!

1486
01:46:43,703 --> 01:46:46,998
Just how far do you think
you're gonna get?

1487
01:46:47,081 --> 01:46:48,874
Rlght out the front door.

1488
01:46:48,958 --> 01:46:51,044
That will never happen.

1489
01:46:51,127 --> 01:46:53,130
it is happening.

1490
01:46:53,212 --> 01:46:56,799
My name is Wayne Gale!
I am a friend of Bill Clinton's!

1491
01:46:56,882 --> 01:46:58,718
if anybody puts me in danger-

1492
01:46:58,801 --> 01:47:01,138
You open that gate!

1493
01:47:01,178 --> 01:47:03,264
My name is Wayne Gale-!

1494
01:47:07,768 --> 01:47:09,812
I will personally hunt you down...

1495
01:47:09,854 --> 01:47:12,648
blow the head
off your fucking whore wife...

1496
01:47:12,690 --> 01:47:17,320
and plant your sick ass
into the ground all by myself!

1497
01:47:17,403 --> 01:47:20,072
Another day, perhaps,
but not today.

1498
01:48:37,400 --> 01:48:40,945
This is Wayne Gale,
unfortunately no longer live.

1499
01:48:41,029 --> 01:48:44,615
I am wounded,
all my crew is dead.

1500
01:48:44,700 --> 01:48:48,452
I have left my wife,
and my girlfriend has left me.

1501
01:48:48,536 --> 01:48:51,164
Look back up, that was good!

1502
01:48:51,247 --> 01:48:54,750
Mickey Knox's plan worked;
we walked out the front...

1503
01:48:54,834 --> 01:48:57,586
into my news van
and made our getaway.

1504
01:48:57,671 --> 01:49:00,507
When we were followed
by patrol cars,

1505
01:49:00,589 --> 01:49:03,217
Mallory shot Deputy Sheriff
Duncan Homolka,

1506
01:49:03,300 --> 01:49:05,136
and tossed his body out the back.

1507
01:49:05,219 --> 01:49:07,054
Show 'em your ear.

1508
01:49:07,138 --> 01:49:08,515
Aghh!

1509
01:49:08,515 --> 01:49:11,434
Oh, my God,
that is so gross!

1510
01:49:12,643 --> 01:49:15,146
Why helicopters were not deployed,
I don't know.

1511
01:49:15,188 --> 01:49:19,066
My only thought is, it all happened
too fast for arrangements to be made.

1512
01:49:19,150 --> 01:49:21,193
- Wayne?
- We've pulled up alongside the road...

1513
01:49:21,278 --> 01:49:24,156
to do this interview.
Tensions run high as we-

1514
01:49:24,196 --> 01:49:26,532
We ain't got all fuckin' day.

1515
01:49:26,616 --> 01:49:30,245
So without any further ado,
Mickey and Mallory.

1516
01:49:34,707 --> 01:49:39,421
So, Mallory, after Mickey's incredible
rescue, what did you think next?

1517
01:49:39,503 --> 01:49:42,173
I was just wondering'
how long it would be...

1518
01:49:42,257 --> 01:49:44,467
until me and Mickey
could be alone together,

1519
01:49:44,508 --> 01:49:46,510
and if I could wait that long.

1520
01:49:52,141 --> 01:49:56,145
So... did you have anything
to do with the riot?

1521
01:49:56,188 --> 01:49:59,608
We didn't have nothin' to do
with that riot.

1522
01:49:59,649 --> 01:50:03,445
That was...
whatchamacallem...?

1523
01:50:03,486 --> 01:50:06,030
- Faked?
- Faked.

1524
01:50:06,114 --> 01:50:09,408
They wanna say we masterminded
the whole fuckin' thing.

1525
01:50:09,492 --> 01:50:13,538
Let 'em. it's not like
it's gonna keep us up at night.

1526
01:50:13,621 --> 01:50:17,751
But the truth is, it was...

1527
01:50:17,833 --> 01:50:19,710
fate.

1528
01:50:20,169 --> 01:50:22,546
Ah, yes. Faked it was.

1529
01:50:22,630 --> 01:50:25,384
And you saw it right here,
on "American Maniacs".

1530
01:50:25,466 --> 01:50:28,302
You believe in reincarnation, Wayne?

1531
01:50:28,386 --> 01:50:30,514
Yes, I believe we've all
lived many times.

1532
01:50:30,596 --> 01:50:33,224
So, what's next for the Knoxes?

1533
01:50:33,307 --> 01:50:39,397
Well, I'm thinkin' we can lay
in a big king-size bed,

1534
01:50:39,481 --> 01:50:43,110
and sleep for about two days,

1535
01:50:43,192 --> 01:50:45,111
and I've been thinkin'
about motherhood.

1536
01:50:45,195 --> 01:50:48,448
So, I think me and Mickey
are gonna get started on that,

1537
01:50:48,531 --> 01:50:50,700
as quickly as possible.

1538
01:50:52,743 --> 01:50:54,286
Gotta go.

1539
01:50:54,371 --> 01:50:56,456
How do you two
intend to disappear?

1540
01:50:56,497 --> 01:50:59,126
You're probably the most
famous couple in America.

1541
01:50:59,208 --> 01:51:02,461
There is that underground railroad-

1542
01:51:02,546 --> 01:51:04,547
Okay, end of the interview.

1543
01:51:04,631 --> 01:51:06,758
Let me just
swing the camera around,

1544
01:51:06,841 --> 01:51:09,176
and do my wrap up,
and we're off.

1545
01:51:09,219 --> 01:51:12,264
Oh, we're gonna do
a little wrap up all right, Wayne.

1546
01:51:12,346 --> 01:51:15,892
But it won't be you in the camera,
lookin' dumb and actln' stupid.

1547
01:51:15,934 --> 01:51:18,894
instead, you're gonna be starin'
down the barrels of our shotguns,

1548
01:51:18,979 --> 01:51:22,273
and we're blowin' your brains
all over that tree back there.

1549
01:51:25,277 --> 01:51:28,904
Wait, wait! Time!
Cut, cut, cut!

1550
01:51:28,946 --> 01:51:30,615
That's a fuckin' joke, right?

1551
01:51:32,992 --> 01:51:36,370
I thought during
this whole escape thing...

1552
01:51:36,370 --> 01:51:38,040
a bond had built between us.

1553
01:51:38,122 --> 01:51:40,333
No, not really.
You're scum, Wayne.

1554
01:51:40,416 --> 01:51:43,669
You did it for ratings.
You don't give a shit about us,

1555
01:51:43,754 --> 01:51:45,672
or about anybody
except yourself.

1556
01:51:45,755 --> 01:51:47,924
That's why nobody
gave a shit about you,

1557
01:51:48,007 --> 01:51:50,468
that's why-
"helicopters were not deployed".

1558
01:51:50,509 --> 01:51:53,596
Wait a minute, you fuckin' hypocrite.
What about the indian?

1559
01:51:53,680 --> 01:51:57,183
You said you were done with killing,
you said, "Love beats the demon."

1560
01:51:57,267 --> 01:51:59,852
You said that love beats the demon!

1561
01:51:59,936 --> 01:52:03,731
I am, and it will.

1562
01:52:03,774 --> 01:52:06,234
it's just that you're
the last one, Wayne.

1563
01:52:06,317 --> 01:52:08,195
Don't fuckin' kill me.

1564
01:52:08,277 --> 01:52:11,990
This is not about you,
you egomaniac. I kinda like you.

1565
01:52:12,073 --> 01:52:16,035
But if we let you go,
we'd be just like everybody else.

1566
01:52:16,118 --> 01:52:19,956
Killin' you,
and what you represent, is...

1567
01:52:20,039 --> 01:52:21,333
a statement.

1568
01:52:21,415 --> 01:52:24,418
I'm not 100% sure
exactly what it's sayin',

1569
01:52:24,502 --> 01:52:28,173
but Frankenstein
killed Dr. Frankenstein...

1570
01:52:29,465 --> 01:52:31,300
Wayne...?

1571
01:52:32,594 --> 01:52:35,388
Have some dignity.

1572
01:52:35,471 --> 01:52:38,349
All right, so I'm a parasite.
So what?

1573
01:52:38,391 --> 01:52:41,353
Life is cruel, no one said
it was gonna be easy.

1574
01:52:41,394 --> 01:52:44,189
But don't you two kill!
You belong to us!

1575
01:52:44,271 --> 01:52:46,565
To the public,
to the media!

1576
01:52:46,607 --> 01:52:50,278
That's how it is,
and we are married, mate!

1577
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:53,406
And the point is,
what do we do next?

1578
01:52:53,489 --> 01:52:56,450
I say, we do
a Salman Rushdie-type thing.

1579
01:52:56,492 --> 01:52:58,202
Books, talk shows...

1580
01:52:58,244 --> 01:53:00,913
we lay low, we jump up,
we bob and weave,

1581
01:53:00,955 --> 01:53:03,708
we do Oprah,
we do Donahue,

1582
01:53:03,791 --> 01:53:06,752
do you have any idea
how huge we could be?

1583
01:53:06,794 --> 01:53:09,630
Let's make a little music, Colorado.

1584
01:53:09,714 --> 01:53:11,006
Wait, wait, wait!

1585
01:53:12,050 --> 01:53:16,263
Don't Mickey and Mallory leave
somebody alive to tell the tale?

1586
01:53:16,345 --> 01:53:18,973
We are...
Your camera.

1587
01:53:23,602 --> 01:53:25,104
Okay.

1588
01:54:01,682 --> 01:54:03,601
I'm gonna miss him.

1589
01:54:03,642 --> 01:54:06,479
- Come on, let's go.
- Okay, baby.

1590
01:54:19,825 --> 01:54:21,118
Can we hear him?

1591
01:54:21,202 --> 01:54:23,372
I can't hear him.
I'm not getting anything off this.

1592
01:54:23,913 --> 01:54:25,874
Oh, my God.

1593
01:54:28,667 --> 01:54:32,671
...in other news, a wedding reception
turned into a nightmare...

1594
01:54:34,673 --> 01:54:36,258
...My dad.

1595
01:54:36,343 --> 01:54:38,637
People...

1596
01:54:41,347 --> 01:54:44,518
...because it would end in sex.
That's all I thought about.

1597
01:54:49,605 --> 01:54:52,066
He punched me,
he slapped me again,

1598
01:54:55,444 --> 01:54:57,114
I just wanna say...

1599
01:54:57,155 --> 01:54:58,906
you know, can we--
