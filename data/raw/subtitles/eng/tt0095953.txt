How many times you wash out with EPA?

27
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,069
- Just one or two more days.
- Three times? You're on a roll.

28
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,957
Four cars, three times each.

29
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,191
That's zip for 12. What are you,
a mechanic or a NASA engineer?

30
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,714
I told you I'd never dealt
with Lamborghinis.

31
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,076
You assured me you could deliver
these cars with that time frame.

32
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,119
- Don't tell me that, cos I'm not listening.
- Sir, I hardly think that's necessary!

33
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,749
I'll explain that to my swing loan.
I'm into him for 200,000.

34
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,319
That's thousand. Three zeros.

35
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:32,269
I got all my money in these cars, and if
I don't get my money out, I am finished.

36
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,430
You have to understand our situation.

37
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,034
I got the sharks
snapping at my heels here.

38
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,588
They could've taken my business
11 days ago.

39
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,955
I had to hold them off
with a whip and a chair.

40
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,554
I know delivery is way overdue...

41
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,473
Fucking EPA!
The world is choking on smog,

42
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,350
and they're gonna correct the situation
by keeping my cars off the road?

43
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,475
Babbitt Collectibles.

44
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,155
Have you tried cash? How much can
one of these EPA guys earn in a week?

45
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,912
- Mr Wyatt.
- Wyatt?

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,755
About the swing loan. He doesn't get
the money by 5.30, he'll seize the cars.

47
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,957
- I'm gonna have to call you back.
- Talk to Mr Babbitt on this.

48
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,477
Tell him you watched me sign the cheque,
then you gave it to the mail girl.

49
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,835
Come on, come on. I need this!

50
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,832
I wouldn't do that, sir,
until you talk to Mr Babbitt.

51
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,155
A number for him?
No, he's on the road.

52
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,231
- He wants you to call him...
- Charlie!

53
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,039
Tell him I'm on my way to Barbados,
can he leave a number.

54
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,475
- Charlie!
- What, Lenny? I'm here. Talk to me.

55
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,111
Mr Bateman wants to back out on his car
and wants to take Mr Webb with him.

56
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,236
They found two cars at Valley Motors.

57
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:38,235
Tell him that was me on the other line.
The paperwork will be here momentarily.

58
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,278
- You paying attention?
- Yeah, I'm listening.

59
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,275
Tell them also that I'm knocking off
five grand for their patience, understand?

60
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,955
- Are you sure that you've got it?
- I've got it!

61
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,952
Mr Bateman?
That was Mr Babbitt on the other line.

62
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,600
As it happens,
the cars are passing emissions...

63
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,356
I mean, the cars have passed emissions.
We're waiting for the EPA paperwork.

64
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,558
We'll have that momentarily,
and because of your incredible patience,

65
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,758
we're going to knock off
$5,000 on each car.

66
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,914
Yes, you've been most patient.
We really appreciate your patience.

67
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,594
<i>Well, thank you. Thank you.</i>

68
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,119
- Ready for Palm Springs?
- Charlie, you still want to go?

69
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,272
We're seconds away from
closing this deal, clearing 75 grand.

70
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,033
- Not bad for a couple of phone calls.
- Not bad at all!

71
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,875
- You know where to find us, right?
- Right. I got it under control.

72
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,910
Listen, I don't wanna be
demanding you,

73
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,676
but could you possibly say ten
or 12 words before we get to the hotel?

74
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,354
Hm? Consider it foreplay.

75
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,835
Can you include me
in some of your thoughts?

76
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,639
I'm just thinking.
You know, nothing special.

77
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,554
Maybe it's something we can talk about it,
make a little conversation.

78
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,791
If there's something to talk about,
Susanna, we'd be talking.

79
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,950
What's the big to-do
about me thinking?

80
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,113
<i>I just feel, I'm going away for a few days
with someone. Call me crazy.</i>

81
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,670
- OK. You wanna talk, let's talk.
- I don't wanna talk!

82
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,912
I feel you're excluding me from what's
going on. It's not that I wanna talk.

83
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,992
One of these again.
How did we get back to one of these?

84
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,152
I don't know why
I put up with all this.

85
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,038
You wanted to go to Palm Springs,
and we're going.

86
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,671
- But I didn't want to go alone. I've been...
- Susanna, you wanna talk, let's talk!

87
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,513
- Let's talk.
- This is not talking, this is you...

88
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,759
Yeah?

89
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,833
<i>Charlie, this is Lenny. I've been
trying to contact you for a while.</i>

90
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,310
<i>I got a long-distance call from Mr Mooney,
your father's lawyer.</i>

91
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,994
<i>He's been trying to reach you.</i>

92
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,469
<i>Your father has died, Charlie.</i>

93
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,391
<i>- Charlie?
- Uh-huh?</i>

94
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,758
<i>I'm sorry. The funeral's tomorrow
in Cincinnati. He said you'd know where.</i>

95
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,310
<i>- I've got his number.
- That's not necessary. Anything else?</i>

96
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,709
<i>No, that's it.
If there's anything I can do...</i>

97
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,791
<i>All right.</i>

98
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,911
- Sorry about the weekend, hon.
- Charlie, the weekend?

99
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,635
I told you before,
we had a falling-out a long time ago.

100
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,590
My mother died when I was two.
Him and me, we just didn't get along.

101
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,194
- You're going to the funeral, no?
- Yeah.

102
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,477
- I'm coming with you.
- That's really sweet,

103
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,313
- but there's no point.
- I want to. That's the point.

104
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,995
All right. Sorry,
I forgot who I was talking to.

105
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,591
<i>...our believed neighbour, for our memory,
admiration and respect for him</i>

106
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,070
will live beyond the years
of his life on earth.

107
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,631
Let us consecrate ourselves
to follow his example of zest for life,

108
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,111
dedication to family,
and charity to all.

109
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,829
And now, with sure and certain hope
of resurrection life,

110
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,196
we commend to you
the soul of our departed friend...

111
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,233
Just have to go over the details of the will
tonight, then we're outta here.

112
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,959
I can wait in the car if you like.

113
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,875
<i>Somebody should be watering
those roses. They're dying.</i>

114
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,589
I knew this car my whole life.
Only drove it once.

115
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,037
It's a 1949 Buick Roadmaster convertible.
Only 8,000 production models made.

116
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,429
Straight Eight. Fireball Eight.

117
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:40,672
The first full year
of the Dynaflow transmission.

118
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,228
Know it by rote.

119
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,955
You were his only child.

120
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:05,068
You came along when he was,
what, 45 or something?

121
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:10,075
He probably thought he was never going
to have a son, so he had to love you.

122
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,551
I think you're exaggerating.
You were his child, his son, his blood.

123
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,712
He doesn't look like
a man who doesn't love his son.

124
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,191
What are you doing looking at this?
Put that away! You wanna hear a story?

125
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,714
- Don't get mad.
- The convertible in the garage?

126
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,837
- His baby. That and the goddamn roses.
- Buick.

127
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,835
The car was off-limits. "That's a classic,"
he'd say. "It's not for children. "

128
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:37,596
Tenth grade, I'm 16 years old, and for
once I bring home a report card full of As.

129
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,150
I go to my old man.
"Can I take the car out?"

130
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,674
Take the guys out,
sort of a victory drive.

131
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,469
He says no. I take it anyway.
I steal the keys, I sneak it out.

132
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,189
You took the car
with no permission? Why? Why then?

133
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,874
Because I... I deserved it.

134
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,236
Nothing I did was good enough
for this guy! Don't you understand?

135
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,029
We're on Columbia Parkway, four kids,
we get pulled over.

136
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,348
An accident?

137
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,749
Uh... Pulled over...
Whoo-whoo-whoo!

138
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,355
- What is "pulled over"? Police?
- Yes, police.

139
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,078
- Can I finish?
- Yes.

140
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,278
He called in to report a stolen car, not
his son took the car without permission.

141
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,952
Just stolen.

142
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,749
The other guys' dads bail them out
in an hour. He left me there two days.

143
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,719
- He left you in prison for two days?
- Two days.

144
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,469
Were you scared?

145
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,710
Yeah, I was scared.

146
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,558
- Left home. I never saw him again.
- Charlie, after a year we've been together,

147
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,949
this is the first time
I've heard this story.

148
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,669
It's strange. I mean,
how can you keep all this inside you

149
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,432
and not say anything?

150
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:47,230
When I was a kid and I got scared,
the Rain Man would come and sing to me.

151
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,639
The Rain what?

152
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,189
One of those imaginary
childhood friends.

153
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,432
- What happened to him?
- Nothing. I just grew up.

154
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,437
Not so much.

155
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,430
"And I remember, too,
the day you left home,

156
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:09,196
so full of bitterness and grandiose ideas,
so full of yourself. "

157
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:13,751
"Being raised without a mother,
your heart's hardness is understandable. "

158
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,674
"Your refusal to even pretend
that you loved or respected me,

159
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,352
all these I forgive,

160
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,399
but your failure to write, to telephone,
to re-enter my life in any way,

161
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,198
has left me without a son. "

162
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:30,070
"I wish you all I ever wanted for you.
I wish you the best. "

163
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,030
"I hereby bequeath to my son,
Charles Sanford Babbitt,

164
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,997
that certain Buick convertible,

165
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:44,437
the very car that unfortunately
brought our relationship to an end. "

166
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,354
"Also, outright title
to my prize-winning hybrid rose bushes

167
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,752
to remind him of the value of excellence,
and the possibility of perfection. "

168
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:57,595
"As for my home and all other property,
these shall be placed in trust,

169
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,878
in accordance with the terms of that
certain instrument executed herewith. "

170
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,632
What does that mean, the last part?

171
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:09,670
It means that the estate, in excess
of $3 million after expenses and taxes,

172
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,958
will go into a trust fund for a beneficiary
to be named in this document.

173
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,873
- Who? Who is that?
- I'm afraid I can't tell you that.

174
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,191
- Who controls the money? You?
- No, he's called a trustee.

175
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,794
What is that? How does that work?

176
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,997
Forgive me,
but there's nothing more I can say.

177
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,958
I'm sorry, son.
I can see you're disappointed.

178
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,032
Why should I be disappointed?
I got rose bushes, didn't I?

179
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,953
I got a used car. Whatshisname...
What'd you call him?

180
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,712
- The beneficiary.
- Right.

181
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,793
He got $3 million, but not the rose bushes!
I definitely got the rose bushes.

182
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,553
- Charles...
- I definitely got the rose bushes.

183
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:48,270
- There is no need to...
- To what? To be upset?

184
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,759
To be upset?

185
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,399
If there is a hell, sir,
my father is in it,

186
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,598
and he is looking up right now,
and he is laughing his ass off.

187
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,831
You wanna be his son for five minutes?
Did you hear that letter?

188
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,469
- Were you listening?
- Yes, sir, I was. Were you?

189
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,719
No. Could you repeat it?
Cos I can't believe my fucking ears.

190
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,874
I was looking for you.

191
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,951
How did it go?

192
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,758
I got what I expected.

193
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,595
Susanna, this could
take a few minutes.

194
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,159
Can I help you?

195
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,153
Yes, I think you can.
I have a problem with a private trust...

196
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,674
- That's a terrific suit!
- Thank you.

197
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,876
My father was Sanford Babbitt...

198
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,836
<i>Is this Wallbrook?</i>

199
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,469
Excuse me, is this Wallbrook?
Excuse me.

200
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,075
Dr Bruner is in conference.
Would you like to wait in his outer office?

201
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,072
We'll stay here. Thank you.

202
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,155
Maybe we're not supposed
to be looking around.

203
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,269
<i>Good to have you here.
Good luck to all three of you.</i>

204
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,874
<i>$20 starts you all off
on a very important match.</i>

205
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:15,590
<i>In what 1980 comedy film
did Goldie Hawn get away from it all?</i>

206
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,355
Excuse me, please.
I want to watch the TV. Please.

207
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,674
<i>For whose grandson was the
presidential retreat Camp David named?</i>

208
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,988
<i>- Lisa?
- Eisenhower.</i>

209
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:30,278
<i>For David Eisenhower. And you've got
another five. Ten-dollar lead for Lisa.</i>

210
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,875
<i>In days of yore, what would
a swashbuckler keep in his sheath?</i>

211
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,750
<i>Whatever this is,
I don't understand the point of secrecy.</i>

212
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,195
This patient is an old girlfriend
of my father's?

213
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,319
- I knew your father since you were two.
- The year my mother died.

214
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,437
I'm trustee of the fund,
but this hospital receives nothing.

215
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,988
Maybe that's something
we could discuss.

216
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:18,153
I took on this burden out of loyalty to
your father. That's where my loyalty ends.

217
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,196
And you think
I should feel that loyalty?

218
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,714
I think you feel cheated
out of your birthright

219
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,792
by a man who had
difficulty showing love.

220
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,031
I think if I were in your shoes
I'd probably feel the same.

221
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,636
I was hoping you'd help me understand
the right in what my father's done.

222
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,837
Because failing that,
I have responsibilities of my own,

223
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,559
and they have to be met,
even if that means a fight.

224
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,029
This is not your car,
it's my boyfriend's.

225
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,669
<i>My dad lets me drive slow
on the driveway. I'm an excellent driver.</i>

226
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,239
<i>Are you sure you drive this car?</i>

227
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:51,108
Course, only 28 miles on the odometer
since I drove it a week ago last Saturday.

228
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,556
- Should be more than 28 miles.
- My boyfriend is coming.

229
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,758
Course, today's Monday. I always drive
the car on Saturday, never Monday.

230
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,513
- Who is this guy?
- I don't know. He jumped into the car.

231
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,194
- He can jump out.
- I'm an excellent driver.

232
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,670
That's good. Come on!
I don't have time for this shit.

233
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,799
- Why'd you let him get in? It's not a toy.
- He says he drives this car.

234
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,836
Dad lets me drive slow
on the driveway.

235
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:18,675
Course, the seats were originally
brown leather. Now they're pitiful red.

236
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:22,036
<i>You know,
these seats were brown leather.</i>

237
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,588
- You know this car?
- I know this car.

238
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,392
How do you know this car?

239
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,438
A 1949 Buick Roadmaster Straight Eight.
Fireball Eight.

240
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,954
Only 8,095 production models.

241
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,555
Dad lets me drive slow. But not
on Monday. Definitely not on Monday.

242
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,677
- Who's your dad?
- Sanford Babbitt.

243
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,355
10961 Beechcrest Street,
Cincinnati, Ohio.

244
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,318
That's my address.
What is it with this guy? Hey!

245
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,198
- Who's your mother?
- Eleanor Babbitt.

246
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,669
Died January 5th, 1965,
after a short illness.

247
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,069
- Who the hell are you?
- Uh-oh!

248
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,755
<i>- Wait a second. Where are you going?
- 13 minutes to The People's Court.</i>

249
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,356
- Hold it. I want to ask you a question!
- "What you are witnessing is real. "

250
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,318
<i>Hey, I'm talking to you!</i>

251
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,436
Bruner, who is this guy?

252
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,715
Raymond is your brother.

253
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,389
My brother?
I don't have a brother.

254
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,998
<i>...have your dispute settled in our forum
of People's Court. Dah-dah-dah-dah.</i>

255
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,153
<i>People's Court. Dah-dah-dah-dah.
The People's Court.</i>

256
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,760
<i>"The People's Court".</i>

257
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,719
<i>Hello. I'm Doug Llewellyn,
and welcome to "The People's Court".</i>

258
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,392
- Is he crazy?
- No.

259
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,755
- Is he retarded?
- Not exactly.

260
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,035
- But he's here.
- He's an autistic savant.

261
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,031
I don't know what that means.

262
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,350
They used to be called "idiot savants".

263
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,238
They have certain deficiencies,
certain abilities.

264
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:53,029
- He's retarded.
- Autistic. Actually, high-functioning.

265
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,838
What does that mean?

266
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:59,948
There's a disability that impairs
sensory input and how it's processed.

267
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,315
English here.
You're talking over my head.

268
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,550
He has a problem
communicating and learning.

269
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,794
He can't express himself, or understand
his own emotions in a traditional way.

270
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:14,476
<i>...with the clipboard,
and after that, the dog bit him.</i>

271
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,437
<i>I yelled at my dog.
The dog lay down...</i>

272
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,909
There are dangers everywhere
for Raymond.

273
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,878
Routines, rituals -
it's all he has to protect himself.

274
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,235
Rituals. That's a good one.

275
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:30,759
It's the way he acts, sleeps, eats, uses
the bathroom, walks, talks - everything.

276
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,638
Any break from the routines,
and it's terrifying.

277
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,712
- How long has he been here?
- Let's see. I came here in 1960...

278
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,270
- No, how old is he?
- He was 18 or 20 then. I'd have to check.

279
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,670
- You've been here that long?
- That's when I started.

280
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:49,756
'65, '75, '85... I was almost three years old,
and you knew I was his brother.

281
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,111
Yes, but what's the point?

282
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,431
The fuckin' point is, why didn't
anyone tell me I had a brother?

283
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,717
What would you
have done about it?

284
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,552
I don't know.

285
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,028
Does he know
how much money he's been left?

286
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,033
No, he doesn't understand
the concept of money.

287
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,680
He doesn't understand
the concept of money?

288
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:17,153
He's just inherited $3 million,
he doesn't understand the concept?

289
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:21,028
That is fuckin' poetic,
don't you think?

290
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,996
Good old Dad.

291
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:29,596
<i>Then who's playing first? Yes.
I mean the fella's name playing first base.</i>

292
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:33,116
- Who. What are you asking me for?
- What is this? Why is he doing that?

293
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,512
Whenever he gets nervous, he does
"Who's on First?" - Abbott and Costello.

294
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,751
It's his way of dealing
with you touching his books and stuff.

295
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:44,515
- So he memorised "Who's on First"?
- Yeah. That among other things.

296
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,397
Raymond. Ted Kluzevski.

297
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,155
Kluszewski. Ted Kluszewski.
"Big Klu". First base.

298
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,710
- He played for Cincinnati.
- He was traded for Dee Fondy, 1957.

299
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,837
- Lifetime batting average 298...
- He reads, huh?

300
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,639
Reads and remembers
whatever he gets his hands on.

301
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,039
Oh! Oh!

302
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,429
Oh, Vern! V-E-R-N!

303
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,034
Course, these people
are going to be here all day.

304
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:10,557
This is an unannounced visit.
This is definitely not a weekend visit!

305
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,756
He's getting anxious.
It's OK, Ray!

306
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,638
Vern! Oh... Uh-oh. You're...

307
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,190
- This is an unannounced visit.
- He said not to touch the books.

308
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,316
- Not to touch books.
- You like Shakespeare?

309
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,549
I don't know.

310
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,631
- Did you read all this?
- I don't know.

311
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,076
<i>- Did you read Macbeth? Hamlet?
- I don't know. Vern!</i>

312
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,878
<i>- Twelfth Night?
- Stop it!</i>

313
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,279
- Yes.
- Yes?

314
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,911
You read all the stories in this book,
and you don't know if you read the book?

315
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,956
- I don't know. V-E-R-N.
- You don't know?

316
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,759
Maybe you'd better put it back.

317
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:44,913
You don't know. OK. No, Ray,
take it easy, I'm not gonna...

318
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,070
I won't touch anything else.

319
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,118
It's OK, Ray.
Come on. My main man!

320
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,431
Vern, my main man.
My main man Vern.

321
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,829
- It's OK, Ray.
- Yeah.

322
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,751
- My main man.
- Yeah, my main man.

323
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,755
Here are your cards. I'm sorry. I didn't
know where you wanted me to put them.

324
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,389
Are-are-are you taking
any prescription medication?

325
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,837
<i>He likes you.
That's just his way of showing it.</i>

326
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:14,310
- Uh-oh.
- But I touched him, he pulled away.

327
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,198
Don't take it personal.
He never touched me.

328
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,795
I'm closer to him than anybody.
I've known him for nine years.

329
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,908
It's not in him. If I left town tomorrow
and didn't say goodbye, he'd never notice.

330
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,672
<i>He wouldn't notice?</i>

331
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,594
I'm not sure, but I don't think
people are his first priority.

332
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:35,275
Hey, Ray, you want to go take a walk?
Hm? Ray?

333
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,113
Ray?
Can he hear us when he's like that?

334
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,270
You want to show your brother
your ducks?

335
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,477
<i>Course, it's 27 minutes to Jeopardy.</i>

336
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,790
Don't worry, Ray.
We'll bring you right back.

337
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,908
<i>- Practically 26 minutes to Jeopardy.
- We'll bring him right back.</i>

338
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,434
<i>I won't do it. I won't do it!</i>

339
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,991
First of all, because of this
tone of voice, this commanding...

340
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:05,232
You're upset. Just calm down.
Raymond, I'm gonna talk to Susanna.

341
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,550
- Bye, Raymond.
- Susanna! Just hold on.

342
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,916
I'll be right back.
No, just stay.

343
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,274
Just stay there.

344
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,796
No, Raymond. Raymond.
Raymond! Raymond! Just stay there.

345
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,270
Just stand still, OK?
That's... that's good.

346
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,797
I'll do it if you tell me why.
Why do I do... Ohh!

347
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,155
- What?
- Why do I have to take the car

348
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,152
and go down there
and wait for you again at the gate?

349
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:35,918
- I've been waiting for you for days. Why?
- It's for Raymond. The car disturbs him.

350
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,911
- That's why?
- That's why.

351
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,195
<i>OK, Raymond.</i>

352
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,153
What are you looking at, Ray?
The ducks are over here.

353
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,390
I don't know.

354
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,312
Listen, our father died last week.

355
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,072
- Did they tell you?
- I don't know.

356
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:07,995
You don't know if they told you,
or you don't know what dead is?

357
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,958
That means he's gone.
He's at the cemetery.

358
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,112
- You wanna go see him at the cemetery?
- I don't know.

359
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,591
- Does that mean maybe you wanna go?
- I don't know.

360
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:25,958
I live in Los Angeles. I thought
maybe you'd like to see a Dodgers game.

361
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,350
- Go... go see the Dodgers play.
- Today's an off day.

362
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,670
- We don't have to go today.
- No game scheduled.

363
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,958
I just thought maybe you'd like to
go see Fernando Valenzuela pitch.

364
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:39,077
Fernando Valenzuela's
not scheduled to pitch till Wednesday.

365
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:42,948
He's gonna pitch on Wednesday?
I'm not doing anything on Wednesday.

366
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,632
- Wednesday.
- Let's go to LA.

367
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,472
Yeah.

368
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,357
Come on, Ray.

369
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,956
Course, it's a long way to California,

370
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:55,635
and I'm definitely not supposed to be
off the grounds for more than two hours.

371
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,280
- Have to be back in two hours.
- Wait till you get there.

372
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,875
- People, crowds cheering. You'll love it.
- Have to be back in two hours.

373
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,318
Here's the presidential suite.

374
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,153
- Dinner's at 6.30pm.
- And to the left is Raymond's room.

375
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,915
- Look at this big beautiful room.
- This is definitely not my room.

376
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,833
- It's just for tonight.
- I have to go back to Wallbrook.

377
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,992
Little guy! Whoa!
This is gonna be terrific. We're brothers.

378
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,834
Dr Bruner wants us to spend time
together. We're gonna have some fun.

379
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:59,469
Course, we have tapioca pudding
for dessert.

380
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,074
We can work tapioca pudding.
I'm gonna call Lenny.

381
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,675
Course, this is not my room,
and the bed's in the wrong place.

382
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,035
- That's definitely not my bed.
- You can move it.

383
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:11,351
- Where do you want it?
- Should be near the window.

384
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,228
Course, I don't have my books.
Course, there are no bookshelves.

385
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,232
I'm definitely...
I'm going to be bookless.

386
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,029
Here's a book.
Big telephone book. Lot of words.

387
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,997
Lenny, pick up, will you?

388
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,312
I got $200,000 about to go in the
shithouse and he won't answer the phone.

389
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,073
- Six here means it's nine there.
- No, three.

390
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,354
6.30pm is dinner...

391
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,238
It's three o'clock,
and he doesn't answer the phone?

392
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,149
Orange soda.

393
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,071
Has to be in a can with a straw...

394
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:44,631
Bruner told you that you should do this?
It doesn't make sense to me.

395
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,870
I know what's good for him.

396
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,358
Uh-oh! Uh-oh! V-E-R-N!

397
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,716
Oh, God.
Go see what he's doing, will you?

398
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,120
- Ray?
- V-E-R-N!

399
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,395
- What is it?
- What's happening, homes?

400
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,391
- Uh-oh.
- Everything is fine.

401
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,711
- Charlie, let's take him home. Come on.
- No, he's OK.

402
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:25,236
Get him some dinner, he'll be OK.
What'd you say, you wanted hamburger?

403
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:29,154
- Hamburger, Ray? Huh?
- We have pepperoni pizza Monday night.

404
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,754
Pizza? You get pizza
in the institution?

405
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,876
Course, Monday night's Italian night.

406
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,111
<i>- Mitchell and Mitchell.
- Get me Stu. It's Charlie Babbitt.</i>

407
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,111
<i>I'm sorry, he's not here.</i>

408
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:44,035
<i>- Where is he? I got a legal problem.
- He's out of town until tomorrow.</i>

409
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,714
All right, I'll call him tomorrow.

410
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:50,839
We're not allowed
to watch TV during dinner.

411
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,275
- Definitely not.
- We can watch TV here.

412
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,157
- We're allowed.
- Yeah.

413
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,670
<i>Wheel... of... Fortune!</i>

414
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:04,117
Look at this studio,
filled with glamorous merchandise,

415
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,634
fabulous and exciting bonus prizes.

416
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,952
A pair of cars
for today's busy couple,

417
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,952
thousands of dollars in cash.

418
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:19,114
Over $150,000
just waiting to be won

419
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,636
as we present
our big bonanza of cash

420
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,395
<i>on... Wheel... of... Fortune!</i>

421
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,632
Room service? 321. I'd like to order
a large pizza. Pepperoni, right?

422
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,039
I don't want pepperoni.

423
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:36,318
That's right, a large pepperoni.
How long's it gonna take?

424
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,914
Bring some beer for two,
and an orange soda.

425
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,991
<i>- You got tapioca pudding?
- No, sir.</i>

426
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,436
Just bring the closest thing.
All right. Right.

427
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:48,195
Here, Ray. Take this.
Food is coming shortly.

428
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,669
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah.

429
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:57,231
Course, I'm going to be here
for a long time, a very long time.

430
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,232
Cos I'm gone for good...
gone for good from my home.

431
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,028
<i>Ohh! Ohh!</i>

432
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,518
<i>Oh! Sì! Sì!</i>

433
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,477
<i>Sì.</i>

434
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,071
<i>Ohh!</i>

435
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,831
<i>- Uhh!
- Uh-huh.</i>

436
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:31,708
- What is that?
- I think Raymond is in the room.

437
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:35,190
- What? Raymond, are you in here?
- Charlie... Charlie Babbitt.

438
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,395
Well, get out! Get out!

439
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,199
- Go!
- Stop it!

440
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,111
Uh-oh.

441
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,596
- Jesus...
- Stop it. Go in there with him.

442
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,638
Charlie, he's your brother.
He's afraid.

443
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:54,111
He doesn't understand this.
Come on. Go in there!

444
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,556
What were you doing in my room?
What were you doing in my room?

445
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,756
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

446
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,831
Course, there were noises.

447
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:09,390
Those noises are none of your business.
You understand? Huh?

448
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:14,031
Put the phone book down. Stop acting
like an idiot and go to sleep.

449
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,111
- Go to sleep!
- It's nine minutes to 11.

450
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,590
- Lights out at 11.
- Yeah? Well, new rules.

451
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,478
You don't listen to me! This is...

452
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,836
- What are you talking about?
- I asked you to apologise.

453
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:41,117
- You insulted him again!
- Am I supposed to tuck him in?

454
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,830
You're his brother. They tell you today
for the first time you have a brother.

455
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,275
I don't see in your face one reaction.

456
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,794
I'm not saying joy,
I'm saying something!

457
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:56,910
- You don't know what I'm going through.
- No, because you don't tell me anything.

458
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,356
- You just give me lies! Lies, lies!
- Lies? What lies?

459
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:04,672
This thing that Dr Bruner asked you
to bring him here, this is bullshit.

460
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,876
So why don't you tell me.
Why is he here?

461
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,590
- Because I'm pissed at my father.
- So you bring Raymond here. Why?

462
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,718
- Cos I got him, and they want him!
- This makes no sense!

463
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,316
Raymond was left all the money -
$3 million, every penny of it.

464
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,391
- So?
- So I'll keep him till I get my half!

465
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,311
I deserve that!

466
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,914
What is this? Huh? Susanna?

467
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,072
- Take it easy.
- I've had enough!

468
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,276
You've had enough?
What does that mean?

469
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,430
- I'm leaving.
- You're leaving?

470
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,034
You're leaving me now?
I need you. I need you now!

471
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:42,272
- You need nobody.
- What does that mean? What?

472
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:45,113
Just take it easy.
What is my crime here? Huh?

473
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,876
You use people!
You're using Raymond, you're using me!

474
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:53,396
- You use everybody!
- Raymond! Raymond, am I using you?

475
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,913
- Am I using you?
- Yeah.

476
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,197
Shut up! He is answering a question
from a half-hour ago!

477
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:02,159
What good is $3 million to him? It's
gonna sit there for the rest of his life.

478
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,832
I need that money!
You know I do.

479
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,152
You need it, so it's hardly like stealing!
Then what happens to Raymond?

480
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,789
He'll go back to Wallbrook, or a better
place. I'll put him in a better place.

481
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,030
What's the difference?
He'll be just the same!

482
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,190
<i>- Only you'll have his money!
- His money?</i>

483
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,477
That man was my father, too.
Where's my fucking half?

484
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:22,028
- I'm entitled to it!
- You've kidnapped this man!

485
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,271
I did not take him.
I did not take him. I took my half!

486
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,999
- You're crazy!
- It runs in the family.

487
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:32,312
You're soaking wet and you're gonna
leave in the middle of the night? Wait!

488
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,551
My father stuck it to me all my life.
What do you want from me?

489
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,631
I want out. Out!

490
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,716
- Stop it.
- Good morning!

491
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,519
- Coffee?
- Yes. That'd be good.

492
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:37,674
Sally Dibbs. Dibbs, Sally.
461-0192.

493
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,315
- How did you know my phone number?
- How'd you know that?

494
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:47,269
You said read the telephone book.
Dibbs, Sally. 461-0192.

495
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:51,148
He remembers things,
little things, sometimes.

496
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,516
Very clever, boys.
I'll be right back.

497
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,353
- How'd you do that? How'd you do that?
- I don't know.

498
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,476
- Did you memorise the whole book?
- No.

499
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,357
How far did you get?

500
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,796
"G". Gottsaken.
William Marshall Gottsaken.

501
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,350
- You memorised to "G"?
- Yeah, "G".

502
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,873
A, B, C, D, E, F, G?

503
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,110
"G". Half of "G."

504
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,552
- That's good, Ray.
- Yeah.

505
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,551
- I like that.
- Yeah.

506
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,272
- Are you hungry?
- Yeah. Tuesday we have pancakes.

507
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,510
- That sounds good.
- With maple syrup.

508
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,672
- You bet your butt.
- Bet your butt.

509
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,911
- Uh-oh. Uh-oh...
- They got pancakes.

510
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,276
- What is this, Ray?
- Course, I don't have my toothpicks.

511
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,670
You don't need them.
That was OK in the hotel with the pizza.

512
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,079
In here you eat with a fork.

513
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:44,755
- I don't have my toothpicks.
- You don't need them.

514
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:49,277
- You're gonna eat with a fork.
- I don't have my maple syrup either.

515
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:53,592
- You don't see any pancakes, do you?
- The problem is, maple syrup is not here.

516
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,389
Ray, when we order the pancakes,
they're gonna bring the maple syrup.

517
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,358
Maple syrup is supposed to be
on the table before the pancakes.

518
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,873
We haven't ordered yet.

519
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:05,270
When they bring it after,
it'll definitely be too late.

520
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:09,239
How is that going to be too late?
We haven't ordered the pancakes yet.

521
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,995
We'll be here the entire morning
with no maple syrup and no toothpicks.

522
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:16,914
I'm definitely not gonna...
not gonna have my pancakes without...

523
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,513
- Ow!
- Don't make a scene.

524
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,114
- Ow!
- Stop acting like a fucking retard.

525
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,997
Uh-oh.

526
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,510
What is this?
What are you writing?

527
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,114
What is it?
What the fuck is this?

528
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:52,157
"Serious injury list.
Charlie Babbitt. "

529
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,630
<i>"Serious injury list"?
Are you fuckin' kidding me?</i>

530
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,393
N- N-N-Number 18 in 1988.

531
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,039
"Squeezed and pulled
and hurt my neck in 1988."

532
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:06,352
Squeezed and pulled
and hurt your neck in 1988?

533
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:10,711
<i>- Dr Bruner, it's Charlie Babbitt.
- Where are you, son?</i>

534
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,590
<i>- What matters is who I'm with.
- You have to bring him back, Mr Babbitt.</i>

535
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,912
No problem whatsoever. That'll be
$1.5 million. I just want my half.

536
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,312
<i>- Raymond, don't touch that. It's dirty.
- I can't do that. You know I can't.</i>

537
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,836
<i>Just bring him back, and bring him
back now. This is where he belongs.</i>

538
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,310
I'm his brother. It's...
it's not kidnapping here, is it?

539
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,790
<i>He's always been a voluntary patient,
but that's beside the point.</i>

540
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:39,431
<i>This is where he can get the best care.
We're talking about his wellbeing.</i>

541
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,991
Let's cut through the bullshit, OK?
I'm entitled to part of my father's estate.

542
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,197
If you don't want to cut a deal,
I'll fly him to Los Angeles,

543
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:52,308
stick him in an institution out there,
and we can have a custody battle.

544
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,279
Miss? He needs toothpicks.
Can you help him? Thank you very much.

545
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:01,434
You want to battle me in the courts?
Think about that, Dr Bruner.

546
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:06,514
<i>- Or we can cut a deal right now.
- I don't think you have any idea...</i>

547
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:10,957
Toothpicks. He needs some toothpicks.
Can we just get him some toothpicks?

548
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,032
<i>And I cannot make
any money deals with you.</i>

549
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,714
Then I'll see you in court.

550
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,154
I'll have the check.
Sorry about the toothpicks.

551
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,595
82, 82, 82.

552
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,272
82 what, Ray?

553
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,669
- How much is this?
- Toothpicks.

554
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,991
It's a lot more than 82 toothpicks.

555
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,548
Course, 246 total.

556
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,392
Keep the change.

557
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,550
- How many toothpicks were in there?
- Um...

558
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,757
- 250.
- Pretty close. Let's go, Ray.

559
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,434
246.

560
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:53,070
- There's four left in the box.
- Course, I have to get my backpack.

561
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:01,950
<i>97-X, the future of rock and roll.</i>

Ray, Ray, Ray. Enough already.

569
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,678

00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,438
Lenny, I don't care what you think.
Did they say that?

573
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:44,072
You're gonna have to be more forceful.
Lenny, shut up! I am in serious trouble.

574
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,799
I can't get to these cars.
I can't get the money.

575
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,474
Do you understand that?
My loan is past due!

576
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:53,439
<i>I'll call the loan office

<i>- Listen, Charlie. Let me talk to Wyatt...
- Lenny, just listen.</i>

578

I'll be in LAX in three hours. Remember,
the Buick is in A-3, main terminal.

579
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:07,311
Make sure they pick it up.
All right. See you in a few.

Trust me. Come on.

Oh, no.

592
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,716
Ray, we're in an airport.
People fly out of airports.

593
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,189
What did you think
we were doing here?

594
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:00,308
In 1987, there were 30 airline accidents.
230 fatalities, 211 definitely passengers.

595
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,473
This plane is very safe. I've got to get
to LA, and I don't have time for this shit.

596
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,677
- L-I-I don't know.
- You don't know?

597
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,512
- No.
- Is it this airline?

598
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,272
- Yeah.
- Is it this airline?

599
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:15,592
OK. Fine. We can, uh...
There's an American plane.

600
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:20,196
American flight 625
crashed April 27th, 1976.

601
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:23,590
- We don't have to take American.
- Yeah, pick another airline.

602
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:24,908
Continental.

603
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:31,269

Flight 1713. 28 casualties.

- Very serious.

605
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:37,996
I have to get to Los Angeles. So you're
gonna get on that plane, understand?

606
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:41,834

- Yeah, get on a plane.

607

- Now, there's a... there's a Delta.
- Yeah.

But how's Delta?

609
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,990
Delta crashed August 2nd, 1985.
Lockheed L-1011.

610
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:54,277
Dallas-Fort Worth.
Terrible wind shear...

611
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:57,557
All airlines have crashed
at one time or another.

612
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:00,950
- That doesn't mean they are not safe.
- Qantas.

613
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,679
Qantas never crashed.

614
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,955

- Never crashed.

- Never crashed.

616

Qantas doesn't fly to LA
out of Cincinnati.

617
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:18,278
You've got to get to Melbourne, Australia,
to get the plane that flies to Los Angeles!

618
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:22,319
Canberra's the capital. 16.2 million
population. Very lovely beaches.

619

You and I are gonna
get on this fucking plane!

Just relax.
He was upset.

623

We're not gonna take the plane.
We're not gonna fly, OK?

624
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,950
No flying.

625
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:55,356

- No flying.

- Yeah.

627
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:02,029
We're gonna drive to Los Angeles.
We're gonna drive to LA. OK? Come on.

628
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:05,112
Ray, come on. Come on. Here.

629
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,397
- No flying.
- Just grab the fucking bag.

630
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,993
No flying.

631
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,436
You're killing me, man. I just want
you to know, you are killing me.

632
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:17,796
I gotta be in LA in three hours,
it's gonna take me three days.

633
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,677
Come on.

634
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,838
- No flying.
- No flying.

635
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:31,636
<i>- Course, I got Jeopardy at five o'clock.
- Don't start with that, Ray.</i>

636
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:34,712
<i>Got Jeopardy at five o'clock.</i>

637
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:09,479
<i>- Dispatch, this is 109.
- Go ahead, 109.</i>

638
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:13,314
See if you can get another unit up here
for point control.

639
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,594
<i>10-40.</i>

640
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,194
Uh-oh.

641
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,357
- Ray?
- Yeah, there's a...

642
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,557
- Get in the car!
- There's a lot of danger on this highway.

643
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:34,349
Just get in the car. Are you crazy?
We'll be out of this in a second.

644
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,556
That's good.
It's OK.

645
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:42,158
That's right. We'll be out of here
in a few seconds. That's good, Ray.

646
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,879
- Definitely a fatal accident.
- Uh-huh. Ray?

647
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,989
Hey! We don't need your help.
Go back to your car.

648
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:51,311
<i>Just a minute!</i>

649
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,470
Ray! Ray! Ray!

650
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,069
Ray!

651
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,477
There's nothing to see here.
Go back and get in your car.

652
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,313
- Yes, sir.
- Go back and get in your car!

653
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:08,472
Just stay there
by the side, OK, Raymond?

654
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:13,076
- Listen, Ray. Just stay there!
- Yeah. Definitely a lot of traffic.

655
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:17,631
Hell of a lot of work for $3 million.
I should just get the hell outta here.

656
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:20,314
<i>Yeah, I hear you!</i>

657
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,514
Stay in your cars, please!

658
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,109
- What's it gonna be, Ray?
- This is a very dangerous highway.

659
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:41,954
- How am I gonna get to LA?
- Course, this interstate's very dangerous.

660
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,713
- You want to get off the highway?
- Yeah.

661
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,438
Well, you gotta get in the car!

662
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:53,039
In 1986, 46,400 male drivers were
definitely involved in fatal accidents.

663
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,076
I got an idea. I got a great idea.

664
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,720
Stay in front of the car
till we get off the exit.

665
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,554
You'll get in, and we'll take
a not-so-dangerous road.

666
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:03,959
- Is that an idea?
- Yeah.

667
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:07,316
Give me five, Ray!
That's a great idea! Give me five! Yeah.

668
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:10,198
This guy's a fucking fruitcake.

669
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:20,833
I'm asking you who's on first. That's
the man's name. Whose name? Yes.

670
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:23,912
Well, go ahead and tell me. Who.
The guy on first. Who.

671
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,752
The first baseman. Who is on first.

672
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:30,277
Whose wife? Yes.
After all, the man earns it.

673
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:34,512
Who does? Absolutely.
What's the guy's name on first base?

674
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:38,036
No. What is on second base.
I'm not asking who's on second.

675
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:40,759
Who's on first.
That's what I'm trying to find out.

676
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:43,718
- Get the hell in the car!
- Yeah, get in the car.

677
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,712
Get in the car.
Course, I have to be in bed by 11.

678
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,839
Lights out at 11. Have to watch TV.

679
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:58,356
Course, now it's almost 19 minutes to 11.
I have to be in bed at 11.

680
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,670
Don't start.
We're not on the interstate.

681
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:03,672
I'm on some shit secondary road,
I gotta make up some time.

682
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:08,470
I gotta get to LA. I should have been there
this afternoon. My business needs me.

683
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:11,358
Definitely watch TV,
but you have to be in bed at 11.

684
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,432
- Forget it.
- Uh-oh. 19 minutes to 11.

685
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:30,588
This is a good one.
"We don't go out when it rains. "

686
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:35,356
I hope you appreciate this, because my
business is going down the fucking toilet.

687
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,714
I should be in LA.

688
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,918
Instead, I'm in the Honeymoon
Haven Motel, Bumblefuck, Missouri,

689
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,150
because you won't go out
when it rains.

690
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:45,231
It's mystifying.
Fuckin' mystifying.

691
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,314
What is this?
Good news, bad news?

692
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:57,233
We passed DOT but failed EPA. It all
ends up the same. I can't get my money.

693
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:01,552
I'm stuck in Cincinnati since the funeral.
So many left over details.

694
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:05,519
My family is, needless to say,
quite overwhelmed.

695
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:11,072
Well, thank you. I appreciate it.
It is a shock, to say the least.

696
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:13,549
Thank you.
Can I get an extension on that loan?

697
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:16,757
Just a couple of days
would make a world of difference.

698
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,389
"We don't go out
when it's raining. "

699
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:34,832
What? Speak up, Lenny. I bought time.
I didn't buy that kind of time.

700
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,229
- You're gonna have to... How much?
- It's 12.30.

701
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,390
- What?
- Lunch is 12.30.

702
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:42,278
- What do you want for lunch?
- Wednesday's fish sticks.

703
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:46,069
- Green lime Jell-O for dessert.
- You want another apple juice?

704
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,754
Orange soda. Oh! It's 12.31.

705
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,910
I gotta go.
He's starting to rock and moan.

706
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,116
- Definitely 12.31.
- It's OK.

707
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,749
<i>- You'd better give me that gun.
- Where is he?</i>

708
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:59,559
<i>- Where is he?
- How did you figure to frame him?</i>

709
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,279
<i>Framed? Who's been framed?</i>

710
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:06,319
Four fish sticks. There's supposed
to be eight. There's only four.

711
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,799
Eight?

712
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:08,869
There's eight.

713
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,916
Take a shower, Ray? Hm?

714
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,912
- Ray. You take a shower, right?
- Yeah.

715
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,279
It's the same thing as the rain - you get
a little wet. What do you say? Huh?

716
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:24,036
- Course, the shower's in the bathroom.
- That's the end of that conversation.

717
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:28,079
<i>- Go again.

723
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:47,349
Stu, legally, Bruner never established
a conservatorship of Raymond?

724
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:51,033
He didn't figure anyone
would contest his authority.

725
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:56,194
If that's the case, I definitely
will get custody and the $3 million.

726
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:00,478
You set up a date... you set up a date
for the custody hearing.

727
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:02,994
Stu, I want a firm date,
and I want it early.

<i>It wasn't an original record, because
the original song had two verses...</i>

Lenny, she hasn't come in?
She hasn't called?

730
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,880
If you see her or hear from her,
tell her to call me.

<i>The Air Alpha Force.

- I'm an excellent driver.

00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:44,231
- You know how to drive?
- Yeah.

736
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:46,311
- When did you drive?
- I drove the Buick

737
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,756
when my dad came to Wallbrook.

738
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:53,037
- Was Dad in the car, Ray?
- Yeah.

739
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,151
- He let you drive the Buick?
- Yeah, slow, on the driveway.

740
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,756
We'll have to let you drive sometime.

741
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:04,115
<i>Raymond!</i>

742
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:07,351
Never touch the steering wheel
when I'm driving! You hear me?

743
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,876
Yeah. Course, I don't have my underwear.

744
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,793
- What?
- I'm definitely not wearing my underwear.

745
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:17,589
- I gave you a fresh pair of mine.
- Not my underwear.

746
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,830
I told you to put them on.
Where are they?

747
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,990
They're in the pocket of my jacket.

748
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:25,789
- Where?
- Here. These... these are too tight.

749
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:28,474
- I don't want them back.
- These are not boxer shorts.

750
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:32,189
- What's the difference?
- These are Hanes 32.

751
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:34,794
My boxer shorts have my name in.
It says "Raymond".

752
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:39,954
- We'll pick you up a pair of boxer shorts.
- I get mine in Kmart, Cincinnati.

753
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:42,076
We're not going back to Cincinnati.

754
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:46,358
- 400 Oak Street.
- You don't have to go to Cincinnati.

755
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:49,637
- That's Oak and Burnett. Kmart.
- What did I say, Ray?

756
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:54,032
You hear me. I know you hear me!
You don't fool me with this shit.

757
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:57,635
- Yours are too tight.
- Ray, did you fuckin' hear what I said?

758
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:59,915
- Shut up!
- Yeah.

759
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:06,910
Cincinnati's a long way off.
We're getting further away from Kmart.

760
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,753
You don't have to go to Cincinnati
to get underwear.

761
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:13,628
- Kmart. 400 Oak Street.
- We are not going to Cincinnati.

762
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:16,188
- I get my boxer shorts at Kmart.
- Did you hear me?

763
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:18,953
I don't wanna be shortless.

764
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,034
I'm going out of my mind!
Out of my mind!

765
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:30,591
What difference does it make
where you buy underwear?

766
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:33,558
What difference does it make?
Underwear is underwear!

767
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:38,236
It is underwear wherever you buy it!
In Cincinnati or wherever!

768
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:41,039
- Kmart.
- You know what I think, Ray?

769
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:43,554
I think this autism
is a bunch of shit!

770
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:46,552
Cos you can't tell me
you're not in there somewhere!

<i>Boxer shorts.
Boxer shorts at Kmart.</i>

These are Hanes 32
Mine are boxer shorts.

773
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:59,118
You're driving me crazy. We'll have
to make a stop, find a psychiatrist.

774
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:02,909
- Cos you are driving me crazy.
- Oak and Burnett.

775
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,629
We have to buy them at Kmart.
Oak and Burnett.

776
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,996
Uh-oh! Course, your shorts
are on the highway.

777
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,196
Let's go back
to Cincinnati and Kmart.

778
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:40,714
Good luck trying to find
a shrink in this town.

779
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,317
Raymond?

780
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:53,870
Hey, you! Dipshit! Move it!

781
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:01,394
You ain't gonna move, I'll move you.
Hey, buddy! Hey, you!

782
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:04,119
- You're gonna get run over.
- Whoa! Whoa! Hey!

783
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:08,034
You're gonna get hurt.
Hey, you hear me? Hey! Hey!

784
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:11,192
- Move it!
- Hey! It's all right! It's all right!

785
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:14,590
I'm sorry. He's from out of town.
Raymond, come on.

786
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:17,433
- It's all right.
- Got to get to Kmart.

787
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,556
Raymond, Raymond, Raymond.
Come on.

788
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:21,471
Kmart. 400 Oak Street.

789
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:23,755
- It said "Don't Walk. "
- Yes, it's broken.

790
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:31,994
I have to get to Kmart.
400 Oak and Burnett. Oak and Burnett.

791
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:36,833
He said "Young man, go West. Go West. "

792
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:41,550
This is the way our country developed,
from the East Coast to the West Coast.

793
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:43,790
During that period of time...

794
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:50,637
...there was initiated
what is known as the pony express.

795
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:54,269
I'm sure all of you
have read something about it.

796
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:56,920
I may not have the days exactly right,
or the years,

797
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,471
but I'm more or less familiar
with the history of the United States,

798
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:04,393
- and I'd love to tell you the story...
- He's artistic?

799
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:08,632
- No. He's autistic.
- I'm not familiar with that.

800
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:11,712
What is the exact nature
of the problem?

801
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:15,190
Well, he lives in a world of his own.

802
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:18,636
I'm sorry, but what's wrong with him?

803
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:22,918
- It was a problem getting mail...
- Raymond, do "What's on First?"

804
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,992
Who's on first.
What's on second.

805
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:31,109
They set up a national programme,

806
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:37,196
where a pony express would ride
for approximately 20 miles...

807
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:42,549
<i>What am I supposed to do?
There's gotta be something I can do.</i>

808
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:49,079
I'm not a psychiatrist, but I do know
his brain doesn't work like other people.

809
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:53,119
If he's getting on your nerves, just take
a break. Spend some time away from him.

810
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,668
- Sure. I'll just send him back.
- Sorry?

811
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:57,716
Nothing. It's just an... inside joke.

812
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:01,998
You're telling me I just have to deal
with this stuff? I just got to deal with it.

813
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,753
<i>Yeah, that's about it.</i>

814
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:09,231
Out of curiosity,
does he have any special abilities?

815
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:12,869
He's got a pretty good memory.
He counts toothpicks.

816
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,633
- Huh?
- They spilled a box of toothpicks,

817
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:20,430
and he took one look at 'em
and counted them in seconds.

818
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:23,034
- Ray! Raymond!
- Yeah.

819
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:26,590
- Are you good with numbers?
- Yeah.

820
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:28,591
I want to try something here.

821
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:32,195
- Kmart, 400 Oak Street.
- I told you, after this. After this.

822
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:34,555
- Ray, can we try something?
- Yeah.

823
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:39,589
Do you know how much
312... times... 123 is?

824
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:42,238
38,376.

825
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,835
- He's right.
- What?

826
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:46,194
He's right.

827
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:50,798
Ray, how much is 4,343

828
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,917
times 1,234?

829
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,956
5,359,262.

830
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:58,759
- He's a genius.
- That's right.

831
00:59:58,840 --> 00:59:59,670
He's a genius.

832
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:04,038
Ray, do you know how much
the square root of 2,130 is?

833
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:09,314
46.15192304.

834
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:12,633
<i>- 2304.
- That's amazing.</i>

835
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:16,395
That is amazing. He should work
for NASA or something.

836
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:20,789
If you had a dollar,
and you spent 50 cents,

837
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,713
how much money
would you have left?

838
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:27,879
About 70.

839
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:30,713
- 70 cents?
- So much for the NASA idea.

840
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:33,792
- Kmart. Should go to Kmart.
- After this, Ray.

841
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,950
- Ray.
- 400 Oak Street.

842
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:38,793
Ray, do you know
how much a candy bar costs?

843
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,950
- About $100.
- $100, huh?

844
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:43,508
- Yeah.
- How about a new compact car?

845
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:45,477
About $100.

846
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:50,109
In his case, he's pretty well-off.
He's very high-functioning.

847
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:54,398
Most autistics, they can't speak
and they can't communicate.

848
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,436
- Ray!
- Yeah.

849
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:59,034
- Do you know what "autistic" is?
- Yeah.

850
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:01,873
- You know that word?
- Yeah.

851
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:04,349
Are you autistic?

852
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:06,873
I don't think so.

853
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:10,348
No, definitely not.

854
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:18,310
Lenny, shut up.
Let me see if I understand this.

855
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:21,870
- Very small here.
- It's $10,000 additional for each car?

856
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:25,748
- Course, it's very crowded.
- Ray, please. One little second.

857
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:27,239
Huh? What?

858
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:31,598
They want to take out the manifold
to put in a fuel injection system? Now?

859
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,193
That is nonsense!

860
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:36,829
What are you doing?
Just leave this on!
