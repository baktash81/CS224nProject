1
00:00:56,986 --> 00:01:00,280
In Virginia, high school
football is a way of life.

2
00:01:00,364 --> 00:01:02,324
It's bigger than Christmas Day.

3
00:01:02,408 --> 00:01:04,659
My daddy coached in Alexandria.

4
00:01:04,744 --> 00:01:07,037
He worked so hard my mama left him,

5
00:01:07,121 --> 00:01:08,747
but I stayed with Coach.

6
00:01:08,831 --> 00:01:10,916
He needed me on that field.

7
00:01:13,252 --> 00:01:15,462
Up until 1971 in Alexandria,

8
00:01:15,546 --> 00:01:17,339
there was no race-mixing.

9
00:01:17,423 --> 00:01:19,758
Then the school board,
forced us to integrate.

10
00:01:19,842 --> 00:01:22,677
They combined the white school
and the black school into one,

11
00:01:22,762 --> 00:01:25,514
called T.C. Williams High School.

12
00:01:34,941 --> 00:01:38,235
Murderer! Murderer!

13
00:01:38,528 --> 00:01:40,320
That summer,
a black teenager was killed

14
00:01:40,404 --> 00:01:41,988
by a white store owner.

15
00:01:42,073 --> 00:01:44,491
And the city
was on the verge of exploding.

16
00:01:49,288 --> 00:01:50,831
You've caused enough damage!

17
00:01:50,915 --> 00:01:52,541
- This is my store!
- Back off!

18
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:55,460
Go left! Go left! Left!

19
00:01:57,296 --> 00:01:59,798
Come on, Kirk, don't let Ray
back you down like that!

20
00:01:59,882 --> 00:02:01,716
You're twice his size!

21
00:02:01,801 --> 00:02:03,510
What are they doing?

22
00:02:03,594 --> 00:02:05,804
If they keep playing like that,
we'll lose every game!

23
00:02:05,888 --> 00:02:07,556
I didn't think that was so bad.

24
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,770
Looks good, Gerry.
I see you been working.

25
00:02:13,855 --> 00:02:16,022
Thanks. Thanks a lot, Coach.

26
00:02:16,566 --> 00:02:18,400
Listen, with the schools
integrating and all,

27
00:02:18,484 --> 00:02:19,734
some of the guys are
worried about losing

28
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:21,069
their starting positions.

29
00:02:21,154 --> 00:02:23,405
Well, that's something we're
just gonna have to figure out,

30
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:24,948
but you don't worry about that now.

31
00:02:25,032 --> 00:02:27,492
You just keep at it. All right?

32
00:02:27,577 --> 00:02:28,785
Yes, Coach.

33
00:02:29,203 --> 00:02:31,997
Hey, guys!

34
00:02:32,081 --> 00:02:33,707
It's coming down!

35
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:35,500
It's coming down at the store!

36
00:02:35,585 --> 00:02:38,753
They want to burn the place up
'cause that colored kid got shot.

37
00:02:38,838 --> 00:02:40,839
Come on, man, let's go.

38
00:02:41,966 --> 00:02:43,967
Hey. Hey!

39
00:02:45,845 --> 00:02:46,887
Coach?

40
00:02:46,971 --> 00:02:49,973
You just get Sheryl
to the school now, Herb.

41
00:03:00,526 --> 00:03:01,943
Get in the truck.

42
00:03:02,028 --> 00:03:04,529
Gerry, Alan, Ray,

43
00:03:04,614 --> 00:03:06,573
if you ever want to play for me again,

44
00:03:06,657 --> 00:03:08,742
get in the truck, now.

45
00:03:09,035 --> 00:03:11,953
You boys are gonna cool off,
come with me to my office,

46
00:03:12,038 --> 00:03:13,455
help me finish packing my things.

47
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:15,624
Gerry, son, your heart's
in the right place,

48
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:18,043
but you ought to know better
than to embarrass the coach like that.

49
00:03:18,127 --> 00:03:19,961
BERTIER: Hell, why don't you just
kick them all off the team?

50
00:03:20,046 --> 00:03:22,422
I don't want to play with
any of those black animals.

51
00:03:22,506 --> 00:03:23,882
I see him.

52
00:03:24,425 --> 00:03:25,884
Who are you?

53
00:03:25,968 --> 00:03:28,136
I'm Herman Boone.
I'm the new assistant coach.

54
00:03:28,221 --> 00:03:29,846
Well, from the looks of things,

55
00:03:29,931 --> 00:03:32,933
I'd say we got all the help
we need around here.

56
00:03:33,017 --> 00:03:36,686
Why ain't you outside there
with all your little friends, hollering?

57
00:03:40,399 --> 00:03:43,485
This was the time
that was arranged for me

58
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:45,654
to meet with Coach Yoast.

59
00:03:45,738 --> 00:03:47,405
I never miss an appointment.

60
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:50,659
Well, maybe you
just better reschedule.

61
00:03:50,743 --> 00:03:52,661
Coach Boone,
the school board made the decision

62
00:03:52,745 --> 00:03:55,038
to put you on my staff.
I did not hire you.

63
00:03:55,122 --> 00:03:57,749
Well, I came up here to coach at G.W.

64
00:03:58,501 --> 00:04:00,877
I didn't ask the schools to redistrict.

65
00:04:01,128 --> 00:04:02,796
I didn't ask to be assigned to your staff.

66
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,173
So I guess we're both in a situation
we don't want to be in.

67
00:04:05,258 --> 00:04:07,467
But I can guarantee you this, Coach.

68
00:04:07,885 --> 00:04:09,552
I come to win.

69
00:04:09,637 --> 00:04:12,555
Win? Coach Yoast here
has been nominated

70
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,016
to the Virginia High School
Hall of Fame.

71
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:17,852
Fifteen winning seasons.

72
00:04:17,937 --> 00:04:20,063
I won a couple of titles
down in North Carolina.

73
00:04:20,147 --> 00:04:22,440
That's AA ball.

74
00:04:22,525 --> 00:04:24,442
This here's Virginia. We play AAA.

75
00:04:24,527 --> 00:04:26,861
What an opportunity for me, then.

76
00:04:27,697 --> 00:04:29,114
To learn

77
00:04:29,824 --> 00:04:31,366
from the best.

78
00:04:36,163 --> 00:04:38,039
Are those people the movers?

79
00:04:38,124 --> 00:04:40,583
No. Looks like
they're moving in here.

80
00:04:40,668 --> 00:04:42,752
Lord,
how many of them are there?

81
00:04:42,837 --> 00:04:45,880
It only takes one.
Then we're gonna be overrun by 'em.

82
00:04:46,674 --> 00:04:48,675
NICKY: Mommy, where are you
taking my teddy bear?

83
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:51,386
That. Come on, y'all.

84
00:04:52,096 --> 00:04:53,888
Where is everybody?

85
00:04:54,223 --> 00:04:56,057
Nicky, yes.

86
00:04:56,142 --> 00:04:58,810
Look there,
here comes some more of 'em.

87
00:04:59,228 --> 00:05:02,063
That's Dr. Day,
that Negro from the school board.

88
00:05:02,148 --> 00:05:03,857
What's he doing here?

89
00:05:03,941 --> 00:05:06,151
The school board has decided
that Negro, Herman Boone,

90
00:05:06,235 --> 00:05:07,902
is gonna be the head coach at T.C.

91
00:05:07,987 --> 00:05:10,071
It's not fair! My daddy's head coach!

92
00:05:10,156 --> 00:05:11,698
This is gonna be his Hall of Fame year!

93
00:05:11,782 --> 00:05:15,160
And no one is trying to take away
your daddy's future place in the Hall.

94
00:05:15,244 --> 00:05:18,079
You can't just walk in here
and take my daddy's job away!

95
00:05:18,164 --> 00:05:20,790
That is enough, Sheryl. That's enough.

96
00:05:25,463 --> 00:05:26,671
Sheryl!

97
00:05:29,967 --> 00:05:32,844
It's all right, Bill. I feel the same way.

98
00:05:33,554 --> 00:05:37,349
It's those agitators and race-mixers
I feel like taking a swat at.

99
00:05:37,433 --> 00:05:40,143
Troublemakers in the Berg are ready
to put a torch to the city.

100
00:05:40,227 --> 00:05:42,687
You want us to burn up like Watts?

101
00:05:43,564 --> 00:05:45,607
Every head coach in the system
is white.

102
00:05:45,691 --> 00:05:47,108
We had to give them something.

103
00:05:47,193 --> 00:05:49,986
It's the world we live in,
God help us all.

104
00:05:50,529 --> 00:05:53,907
I left North Carolina
because I was passed over

105
00:05:53,991 --> 00:05:56,117
for a job that I had rightfully earned.

106
00:05:56,202 --> 00:05:57,660
Gave it to a white coach down there.

107
00:05:57,745 --> 00:05:59,537
Couldn't even tie up
his own football cleats.

108
00:05:59,622 --> 00:06:01,623
Now you are asking me

109
00:06:01,707 --> 00:06:03,291
to do the same thing to this man?

110
00:06:03,376 --> 00:06:04,959
I can't do that.

111
00:06:05,044 --> 00:06:06,252
Herman?

112
00:06:08,214 --> 00:06:11,800
Folks in Carolina say
you marched with Dr. King.

113
00:06:12,301 --> 00:06:14,969
Say you stood toe-to-toe with the Klan.

114
00:06:15,054 --> 00:06:16,137
Said you're a race man.

115
00:06:16,222 --> 00:06:18,473
That's right. I'm also a family man.

116
00:06:19,266 --> 00:06:20,433
Coach Boone,

117
00:06:20,518 --> 00:06:23,520
black folks have never had anything
in this city to call their own,

118
00:06:23,604 --> 00:06:25,355
except humiliation and despair.

119
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:26,648
Dr. Day, excuse me.

120
00:06:26,732 --> 00:06:29,567
Herman, I think you'd
better look outside.

121
00:06:45,668 --> 00:06:48,336
So, you see, we need you,
Coach Boone.

122
00:06:48,504 --> 00:06:50,505
Come on, meet the people.

123
00:06:50,923 --> 00:06:53,341
Coach Boone, I'm Charles Campbell.

124
00:06:53,426 --> 00:06:55,176
This here is my boy Julius.

125
00:06:55,261 --> 00:06:57,011
He can be the finest defensive end

126
00:06:57,096 --> 00:06:58,847
in the whole state if you push him to it.

127
00:06:58,931 --> 00:07:00,432
I've heard a lot about you.

128
00:07:00,516 --> 00:07:02,058
You're like an answer to our prayers.

129
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,893
Now, wait a minute.
I'm not an answer to your prayers.

130
00:07:03,978 --> 00:07:07,981
I'm not a savior or Jesus Christ,

131
00:07:08,065 --> 00:07:09,691
Martin Luther King,
or the Easter Bunny.

132
00:07:09,775 --> 00:07:11,818
I'm a football coach, that's all.

133
00:07:11,902 --> 00:07:14,404
- Just a football coach.
- You're our coach.

134
00:07:14,655 --> 00:07:16,114
You're our coach!

135
00:07:16,198 --> 00:07:17,740
Coach Boone!

136
00:07:22,204 --> 00:07:25,331
Boone! Boone! Boone!

137
00:07:36,719 --> 00:07:38,386
What do you want?

138
00:07:40,306 --> 00:07:41,639
Is Coach Yoast here?

139
00:07:41,724 --> 00:07:43,057
We're busy

140
00:07:43,142 --> 00:07:45,560
interviewing for head coaching jobs.

141
00:07:45,644 --> 00:07:48,730
Gotten 11 offers and
certainly no time for you.

142
00:07:59,241 --> 00:08:02,285
Well, come on in.
I've got an office out back.

143
00:08:04,288 --> 00:08:06,247
Look, I can't even
spell diplomacy,

144
00:08:06,332 --> 00:08:08,416
and I'm sorry about
the way things went down,

145
00:08:08,501 --> 00:08:12,962
but make no mistake, I am qualified
to be this school's head coach.

146
00:08:13,047 --> 00:08:16,174
Sure. You've been in, what,
4 or 5 programs in the past 10 years?

147
00:08:16,258 --> 00:08:17,842
With 4 or 5 championships.

148
00:08:17,927 --> 00:08:19,427
This isn't about me.

149
00:08:19,678 --> 00:08:21,596
I'm worried about my boys.

150
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,432
Well, I ain't gonna cook 'em
and eat 'em.

151
00:08:24,725 --> 00:08:27,685
The best player will play.
Color won't matter.

152
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:30,271
From the looks of our
little situation we got us here,

153
00:08:30,356 --> 00:08:32,357
I'd say it's about all that does.

154
00:08:32,441 --> 00:08:33,983
Yeah, you're right.

155
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:36,778
We're in a tough spot, Coach,
you, me, the whole city.

156
00:08:36,862 --> 00:08:39,072
I think it would go a long way
to smooth things over

157
00:08:39,156 --> 00:08:41,449
if you would stay, work on the staff,

158
00:08:41,534 --> 00:08:44,702
be a defensive coordinator,
assistant head coach.

159
00:08:45,621 --> 00:08:47,163
Work under you?

160
00:08:47,957 --> 00:08:50,166
If that's the way you see it.

161
00:08:53,045 --> 00:08:54,754
Good night, Coach.

162
00:09:00,344 --> 00:09:03,304
It's been a rare privilege
to have lived here as long as I have

163
00:09:03,389 --> 00:09:05,139
coaching your boys.

164
00:09:05,224 --> 00:09:06,975
I'll be taking the year off...

165
00:09:07,059 --> 00:09:08,476
No.

166
00:09:08,561 --> 00:09:10,812
...after which I'll be moving to Loudoun,

167
00:09:11,647 --> 00:09:14,899
taking the head coaching job
at Loudoun High.

168
00:09:15,317 --> 00:09:18,695
- I say boycott T.C. Williams!
- Tell 'em, Fred!

169
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:21,114
Our boys aren't playing
for some Coach Coon!

170
00:09:21,198 --> 00:09:23,241
Coach, he stole your job.

171
00:09:24,034 --> 00:09:25,368
I'm not playing for him.

172
00:09:25,452 --> 00:09:27,620
I started a petition,
and I'm sitting this season out.

173
00:09:27,705 --> 00:09:30,665
Only place you're going to sit
is right back in that chair, Gerry.

174
00:09:30,749 --> 00:09:32,000
I appreciate it, though.

175
00:09:32,084 --> 00:09:35,169
Boycott T.C.!
Boycott the school!

176
00:09:35,254 --> 00:09:37,338
Stop this, Fred.
You know that none of these boys

177
00:09:37,423 --> 00:09:40,008
can afford to go to some other district
just to play ball.

178
00:09:40,092 --> 00:09:43,344
They sit this one out,
they put their futures on the line.

179
00:09:43,429 --> 00:09:45,680
Coach, I'm out, too.

180
00:09:45,764 --> 00:09:47,682
- I ain't playing for no thief.
- Don't do this.

181
00:09:47,766 --> 00:09:51,269
Don't make this any harder
for me than it already is.

182
00:09:51,353 --> 00:09:52,437
Coach, if you go, I go.

183
00:09:52,521 --> 00:09:54,397
I only play for you,
Coach Yoast!

184
00:09:54,481 --> 00:09:56,691
Don't go, Coach.
You can't leave us.

185
00:09:56,775 --> 00:09:59,736
Coach Yoast! Coach Yoast!
Coach Yoast!

186
00:10:06,243 --> 00:10:08,328
We'll be all right, Coach.

187
00:10:09,622 --> 00:10:11,831
I've coached most of these boys
since they were your age.

188
00:10:11,915 --> 00:10:13,458
I've seen them grow up
in front of my eyes,

189
00:10:13,542 --> 00:10:15,793
almost like they were my own kids.

190
00:10:15,878 --> 00:10:17,045
Almost.

191
00:10:18,672 --> 00:10:20,840
This is a heck of a time
to be abandoning them

192
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:23,301
to look out for themselves, ain't it?

193
00:10:23,719 --> 00:10:25,720
So, what are you gonna do?

194
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,475
We gonna play some ball, y'all!

195
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:32,977
Black inside, black inside, black inside.

196
00:10:35,022 --> 00:10:38,691
Yo, Petey, how many yards you figure
you gonna get this season, bro?

197
00:10:38,776 --> 00:10:40,109
You know, I ain't one to brag, big Blue,

198
00:10:40,194 --> 00:10:42,737
but I figure on at least a thousand.

199
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,447
But I ain't one to brag.

200
00:10:44,531 --> 00:10:46,741
Didn't I tell you all them white boys
weren't gonna play for no brother?

201
00:10:46,825 --> 00:10:47,950
Well, who needs 'em, baby?

202
00:10:48,035 --> 00:10:52,205
From now on the Titans is gonna be
powered by soul power, bro.

203
00:10:52,373 --> 00:10:56,292
He said soul power

204
00:10:57,503 --> 00:10:58,753
- JULIUS: Shut up.
- You shut up.

205
00:11:09,598 --> 00:11:11,349
Put your hand down.

206
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,394
You're smiling.

207
00:11:14,478 --> 00:11:15,895
- Yes.
- "Yes, sir."

208
00:11:15,979 --> 00:11:18,147
- Yes, sir.
- Why are you smiling?

209
00:11:18,232 --> 00:11:20,608
'Cause I love football. Football's fun.

210
00:11:20,693 --> 00:11:22,610
- "Fun, sir." It's fun?
- Fun, sir.

211
00:11:22,695 --> 00:11:23,903
- Yes.
- You sure?

212
00:11:23,987 --> 00:11:25,154
- I think...
- Now you're thinkin'.

213
00:11:25,239 --> 00:11:26,948
First you smile, then you think.

214
00:11:27,032 --> 00:11:29,409
You think football is still fun?

215
00:11:29,618 --> 00:11:30,660
- Yes.
- "Sir."

216
00:11:30,744 --> 00:11:33,121
- Yes... No, sir.
- No?

217
00:11:33,205 --> 00:11:35,456
- It was fun.
- Not anymore, though, is it?

218
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:36,999
- Is it?
- Not right now.

219
00:11:37,084 --> 00:11:39,711
It's not fun anymore.
Not even a little bit.

220
00:11:40,212 --> 00:11:41,295
- No.
- Make up your mind.

221
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,923
Think, since you're thinking.
Go on, think. Is it fun?

222
00:11:44,007 --> 00:11:46,050
- No, sir.
- No? Absolutely not?

223
00:11:46,135 --> 00:11:47,176
Zero fun, sir.

224
00:11:47,261 --> 00:11:49,929
All right, listen up. I'm Coach Boone.

225
00:11:50,013 --> 00:11:52,640
I'm gonna tell you all about how much

226
00:11:53,142 --> 00:11:55,727
"fun" you're gonna have this season.

227
00:11:55,811 --> 00:11:58,771
We leave for camp,
Gettysburg College,

228
00:11:58,856 --> 00:12:01,816
August 15th, 7:29 a.m.

229
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,735
If you report at 7:30,

230
00:12:03,819 --> 00:12:05,820
you will not be playing
football this season,

231
00:12:05,904 --> 00:12:06,988
you will be watching.

232
00:12:07,072 --> 00:12:09,407
You will wear a jacket, shirt, and tie.

233
00:12:09,491 --> 00:12:10,742
If you don't have one, buy one.

234
00:12:10,826 --> 00:12:13,536
Can't afford one,
then borrow one from your old man.

235
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,204
If you don't have an old man,

236
00:12:15,289 --> 00:12:18,082
then find a drunk, trade him for his.

237
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,042
'Cause I can guarantee you
there isn't a bum on the street

238
00:12:20,127 --> 00:12:21,836
that looks as raggedy and ridiculous

239
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,504
as what I'm looking at right now.

240
00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:25,423
This is no democracy.

241
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,301
It is a dictatorship.

242
00:12:28,427 --> 00:12:29,969
I am the law.

243
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:33,723
If you survive camp,
you will be on the team.

244
00:12:35,809 --> 00:12:37,351
If you survive.

245
00:12:39,188 --> 00:12:41,731
- Check 'em in, Coach.
- Checking 'em in.

246
00:12:41,857 --> 00:12:44,233
I'm Coach Hinds,
your offensive line coach.

247
00:12:44,318 --> 00:12:46,652
Yell out your name and position
starting from the right.

248
00:12:46,737 --> 00:12:48,571
Petey Jones, running back.

249
00:12:48,697 --> 00:12:50,448
The running back, y'all.

250
00:12:50,532 --> 00:12:52,825
Whatever, Petey! Get outta here!

251
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:56,329
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Jerry Harris, quarterback.

252
00:12:56,413 --> 00:12:59,415
Hallelujah! Hallelujah, Rev!

253
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,793
- Rev?
- It's just a nickname.

254
00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:06,047
And who in the name
of heaven might you be?

255
00:13:06,131 --> 00:13:09,342
Louie Lastik, offensive lineman.

256
00:13:09,426 --> 00:13:11,594
Naval family,
just moved here from Bayonne.

257
00:13:11,678 --> 00:13:13,721
Someone said football,
so I come running.

258
00:13:13,806 --> 00:13:15,890
What's going on, everybody?

259
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:29,237
With him calling the shots,
ain't none of us

260
00:13:29,321 --> 00:13:30,988
gonna see nothin'
but the bench this year.

261
00:13:31,073 --> 00:13:33,574
He ain't calling the shots. You'll play.

262
00:13:42,042 --> 00:13:44,919
You have just disrupted
my first team meeting

263
00:13:45,003 --> 00:13:46,546
in an unacceptable fashion.

264
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:49,382
This is my team now.
Either you're with that or you're not.

265
00:13:49,466 --> 00:13:52,593
- I'm here, ain't I? Let's talk football.
- Let's talk football.

266
00:13:52,678 --> 00:13:56,264
- I run the defense...
- As a part of my team strategy.

267
00:13:57,516 --> 00:13:59,517
Now, I have never seen
an assistant coach's name

268
00:13:59,601 --> 00:14:01,269
in the newspaper for losing a game.

269
00:14:01,353 --> 00:14:04,438
I want a job for Coach Tyrell.
He's been with me for 10 years.

270
00:14:04,523 --> 00:14:06,148
I won't leave him out in the cold.

271
00:14:06,233 --> 00:14:08,276
You don't get me without him.

272
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,444
You're overcooking my grits, Coach.

273
00:14:11,738 --> 00:14:16,576
All right. I will allow Coach Tyrell

274
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:20,246
to coach the special team,
but I will have my eye on him.

275
00:14:20,706 --> 00:14:21,956
And you.

276
00:14:28,046 --> 00:14:30,339
Good morning, good morning,
good morning, Coaches. How are you?

277
00:14:30,424 --> 00:14:33,009
- Good morning to you.
- Looks good today, doesn't it?

278
00:14:33,093 --> 00:14:35,803
Just wanted to let you know
what the offense is doing.

279
00:14:35,888 --> 00:14:38,347
Awful skinny playbook, ain't it?

280
00:14:38,432 --> 00:14:41,559
I run six plays, split veer.
It's like Novocain.

281
00:14:41,643 --> 00:14:44,979
Just give it time, always works.
See you on the bus.

282
00:14:45,772 --> 00:14:47,982
Be patient, Bill. Your time will come.

283
00:14:48,066 --> 00:14:50,526
- Herman, here we go.
- Here we go.

284
00:14:54,323 --> 00:14:57,241
- How can I help you boys?
- I'm Gerry Bertier,

285
00:14:57,951 --> 00:15:00,745
the only All-American
you got on this team.

286
00:15:00,829 --> 00:15:02,496
You want any of us to play for you,

287
00:15:02,581 --> 00:15:05,333
you reserve half the open positions
for Hammond players.

288
00:15:05,417 --> 00:15:07,001
Half the offense, half the special teams.

289
00:15:07,085 --> 00:15:08,669
We don't need any of your people
on defense.

290
00:15:08,754 --> 00:15:10,212
We're already set.

291
00:15:10,881 --> 00:15:13,007
Don't need none of my people?

292
00:15:13,091 --> 00:15:15,176
What did you say
your name was? Jerry?

293
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,302
Gerry.

294
00:15:16,386 --> 00:15:18,012
No, you must have said Jerry,
like Lewis,

295
00:15:18,096 --> 00:15:20,765
which would make you
Dean Martin, right?

296
00:15:21,975 --> 00:15:24,769
Ladies and gentlemen,
I got an announcement to make.

297
00:15:24,853 --> 00:15:27,772
We got Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin

298
00:15:27,856 --> 00:15:29,690
going to camp with us here this year.

299
00:15:29,775 --> 00:15:31,317
Jerry tells the jokes,

300
00:15:31,401 --> 00:15:33,945
Dean sings the songs and gets the girl.

301
00:15:34,029 --> 00:15:36,197
Let's give them a round of applause.

302
00:15:42,996 --> 00:15:45,039
Where's your folks, Gerry?

303
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,208
Your parents, are they here?

304
00:15:47,292 --> 00:15:48,876
Where are they?

305
00:15:49,753 --> 00:15:52,213
- That's my mother.
- That's your mama?

306
00:15:52,422 --> 00:15:54,090
Very nice. How are you?

307
00:15:54,174 --> 00:15:56,175
Take a good look at her.

308
00:15:56,843 --> 00:16:00,638
'Cause once you get on that bus,
you ain't got no mama no more.

309
00:16:00,722 --> 00:16:03,182
You got your brothers on the team,

310
00:16:03,266 --> 00:16:04,266
and you got your daddy.

311
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,852
Now, you know who your daddy is,
don't you?

312
00:16:07,562 --> 00:16:10,064
Gerry, if you want to play
on this football team,

313
00:16:10,148 --> 00:16:13,234
you answer me when I ask you
who is your daddy.

314
00:16:15,696 --> 00:16:17,697
Who's your daddy, Gerry?

315
00:16:18,073 --> 00:16:19,740
Who's your daddy?

316
00:16:22,244 --> 00:16:23,619
You.

317
00:16:23,912 --> 00:16:25,454
And whose team is this?

318
00:16:25,539 --> 00:16:28,958
Is this your team,
or is this your daddy's team?

319
00:16:30,168 --> 00:16:31,836
Yours.

320
00:16:32,921 --> 00:16:34,505
Get on the bus.

321
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:38,634
Put your jacket on first
and get on the bus.

322
00:16:42,597 --> 00:16:43,681
Dean?

323
00:16:46,226 --> 00:16:47,935
Fix that tie, son.

324
00:17:00,532 --> 00:17:02,825
All right, listen up,
I want everybody off the bus.

325
00:17:02,909 --> 00:17:05,411
Let's go. Follow me. Everybody.
Let's go right now.

326
00:17:05,495 --> 00:17:06,620
Why we got to get off the bus?

327
00:17:06,705 --> 00:17:08,748
What are they doing, man?

328
00:17:09,624 --> 00:17:11,751
All right, everybody, off the bus.

329
00:17:11,835 --> 00:17:13,753
Listen up, I don't care,
if you're black, green,

330
00:17:13,837 --> 00:17:15,212
blue, white, or orange,

331
00:17:15,297 --> 00:17:18,132
I want all of my defensive
players on this side,

332
00:17:18,216 --> 00:17:20,718
all players going out
for offense over here.

333
00:17:20,802 --> 00:17:24,221
Right now. Let's move! Let's move!
Let's move! Let's move!

334
00:17:24,306 --> 00:17:27,558
You and you, offensive bus.
Sit together.

335
00:17:27,642 --> 00:17:30,394
You and you, defensive bus.
Sit together.

336
00:17:30,479 --> 00:17:31,812
Get comfortable, too.

337
00:17:31,897 --> 00:17:34,273
Because the person that
I have you sitting next to

338
00:17:34,357 --> 00:17:36,984
is the same one you'll be rooming with

339
00:17:37,069 --> 00:17:39,153
for the duration of this camp.

340
00:17:44,201 --> 00:17:45,659
'Cause, baby

341
00:17:45,744 --> 00:17:49,163
There ain't no mountain high enough

342
00:17:49,664 --> 00:17:53,292
Ain't no valley low enough

343
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,127
Blue, shut up.

344
00:17:56,046 --> 00:17:57,963
I don't want to see
your smilin' and shufflin',

345
00:17:58,048 --> 00:18:00,841
and hear all your minstrel show
singing on this bus.

346
00:18:00,926 --> 00:18:02,093
You, too.

347
00:18:03,428 --> 00:18:04,970
Got that right.

348
00:18:06,973 --> 00:18:08,808
You can shut up, too.

349
00:18:28,912 --> 00:18:30,287
That's my bed.

350
00:18:36,503 --> 00:18:37,586
And that's his bed.

351
00:18:43,635 --> 00:18:47,221
I ain't lookin' at that
for two weeks, man. Take it down.

352
00:18:48,723 --> 00:18:51,142
You can close your eyes
for two weeks, all I care.

353
00:18:51,226 --> 00:18:53,227
Why don't you look at your wall
and I'll look at mine?

354
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,645
I'll look wherever I want to,

355
00:18:54,729 --> 00:18:57,064
and I don't want to be
looking at that for two weeks.

356
00:18:57,149 --> 00:18:59,567
Then you better use your
X-ray vision, Superman,

357
00:18:59,651 --> 00:19:02,736
and look right through it,
'cause it ain't coming down.

358
00:19:12,122 --> 00:19:13,414
Fight!

359
00:19:13,874 --> 00:19:15,082
Fight?

360
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:16,125
Fight!

361
00:19:16,751 --> 00:19:17,751
Follow me!

362
00:19:17,836 --> 00:19:18,919
Come on! Come on!

363
00:19:19,004 --> 00:19:20,212
All right, wait up!

364
00:19:20,297 --> 00:19:22,590
Get off me! Get off me!

365
00:19:22,674 --> 00:19:24,592
Get him off!

366
00:19:24,676 --> 00:19:25,843
Get off of me!

367
00:19:25,927 --> 00:19:27,928
Bunch of tough guys, huh?

368
00:19:29,598 --> 00:19:31,599
You look like a bunch
of fifth-grade sissies

369
00:19:31,683 --> 00:19:33,350
after a cat fight.

370
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:38,147
You got anger. That's good.
You're gonna need it, son.

371
00:19:38,231 --> 00:19:40,733
You got aggression. That's even better.
You're gonna need that, too.

372
00:19:40,817 --> 00:19:43,652
But any little two-year-old child
can throw a fit.

373
00:19:44,404 --> 00:19:47,448
Football is about controlling that anger.

374
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:51,035
Harnessing that aggression
into a team effort

375
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:52,995
to achieve perfection!

376
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,623
Some coaches, they cut a player

377
00:19:55,707 --> 00:19:58,209
if they think he's not up to snuff.

378
00:19:59,294 --> 00:20:01,629
When they think he's hurting the team.

379
00:20:01,713 --> 00:20:05,925
This is a public school program.
I will never, ever cut a player

380
00:20:06,009 --> 00:20:09,803
who comes out to play for me.
But when you put that uniform on,

381
00:20:09,971 --> 00:20:12,890
that Titan uniform,
you better come to work.

382
00:20:14,643 --> 00:20:16,518
We will be perfect

383
00:20:17,979 --> 00:20:19,438
in every aspect of the game.

384
00:20:19,522 --> 00:20:21,315
You drop a pass, you run a mile.

385
00:20:21,399 --> 00:20:23,817
You miss a blocking assignment,
you run a mile.

386
00:20:23,902 --> 00:20:25,361
You fumble the football,

387
00:20:25,445 --> 00:20:30,282
and I will break my foot off
in your John Brown hindparts.

388
00:20:30,659 --> 00:20:31,951
And then you will run a mile.

389
00:20:32,035 --> 00:20:33,410
Perfection!

390
00:20:36,915 --> 00:20:38,207
Let's go to work.

391
00:20:41,169 --> 00:20:42,628
Move! Move those feet!

392
00:20:42,712 --> 00:20:43,879
Get up, boy! Get up! Get up!

393
00:20:43,964 --> 00:20:45,881
Get up! Get up! Get up!

394
00:20:47,676 --> 00:20:49,510
Keep that head up!
Keep those heads up!

395
00:20:49,594 --> 00:20:51,470
Keep those feet moving!

396
00:20:51,554 --> 00:20:53,472
Everything we gonna do
is changing.

397
00:20:53,556 --> 00:20:54,640
We are change.

398
00:20:54,724 --> 00:20:56,433
We're gonna change the way we run.

399
00:20:56,518 --> 00:20:58,852
We're gonna change the way we eat.

400
00:20:58,937 --> 00:21:00,646
We're gonna change
the way we block.

401
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:02,773
We're gonna change
the way we tackle.

402
00:21:02,857 --> 00:21:04,400
We're gonna change the way we win.

403
00:21:04,484 --> 00:21:06,652
Defense is desire!

404
00:21:06,736 --> 00:21:08,362
Fire and desire.

405
00:21:08,446 --> 00:21:09,780
Defense! Come on!

406
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,952
Get up. Get outta here. Go run. Go.

407
00:21:21,668 --> 00:21:23,585
Keep those legs movin'!
Keep those legs apart!

408
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:25,170
Keep moving, keep moving.

409
00:21:25,255 --> 00:21:27,214
Keep that ball with you till
you get out of the briar patch.

410
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:29,550
Show me, son! Show me, 'Bama!

411
00:21:29,634 --> 00:21:30,759
Show me, 'Bama!

412
00:21:30,844 --> 00:21:32,761
Jump on that ball carrier
like a starving man

413
00:21:32,846 --> 00:21:34,638
on a Christmas ham.

414
00:21:35,724 --> 00:21:36,724
Hut!

415
00:21:39,728 --> 00:21:41,020
Fumble! Fumble!

416
00:21:41,104 --> 00:21:43,397
What is wrong with you?
Why are you fumbling my football?

417
00:21:43,481 --> 00:21:44,732
- My blockers were bad.
- Your blockers?

418
00:21:44,816 --> 00:21:47,192
Your blockers ain't got nothing
to do with you holding the ball!

419
00:21:47,277 --> 00:21:50,321
Did your blockers fumble the football,
or did you fumble the football?

420
00:21:50,405 --> 00:21:52,990
- I did, sir.
- All right. How many feet are in a mile?

421
00:21:53,074 --> 00:21:54,867
How many feet are in a mile?

422
00:21:54,993 --> 00:21:57,536
Five thousand two hundred
and eighty feet!

423
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:00,789
You pick this ball up,
you run every one of them!

424
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:04,251
You're killing me, Petey!
You're killing me!

425
00:22:15,013 --> 00:22:16,805
What you doing, man?

426
00:22:18,224 --> 00:22:19,767
Eating lunch.

427
00:22:20,769 --> 00:22:23,604
I see you eating lunch.
But why you eating over here?

428
00:22:23,688 --> 00:22:26,690
Why don't you go on over there
and eat with your people?

429
00:22:26,775 --> 00:22:29,735
I don't have any people.
I'm with everybody, Julius.

430
00:22:29,819 --> 00:22:32,237
He's just a light-skinned brother.

431
00:22:32,322 --> 00:22:34,323
Yeah, and I'm a dark-skinned cracker.

432
00:22:35,867 --> 00:22:38,202
Come on, Julius,
he's just another blessed child

433
00:22:38,286 --> 00:22:40,162
in God's loving family.

434
00:22:42,999 --> 00:22:45,000
Come on, Blue, let me...

435
00:22:48,421 --> 00:22:51,131
Lord, we come before you today

436
00:22:51,758 --> 00:22:55,052
and ask you to soften
big Julius Campbell's heart.

437
00:22:55,804 --> 00:22:57,638
Look at that traitor.

438
00:22:57,931 --> 00:23:00,140
And Rev? He better be praying

439
00:23:00,225 --> 00:23:02,309
I block for his black behind.

440
00:23:02,394 --> 00:23:06,021
Yeah, but, Ray, if you don't block
you're not gonna start.

441
00:23:06,314 --> 00:23:07,689
I'll start.

442
00:23:08,817 --> 00:23:10,526
I'll just bide my time.

443
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:13,404
I got some plays
we won the city title with last year.

444
00:23:13,488 --> 00:23:16,240
Got some trick plays,
some stuff that might

445
00:23:16,324 --> 00:23:19,243
fire up the boys'
imaginations a little bit.

446
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,537
Trick plays?

447
00:23:21,621 --> 00:23:23,705
I think unless the boys
start having a little fun,

448
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:25,999
they're not gonna put points
up on that board for you.

449
00:23:26,084 --> 00:23:29,503
You worry about your defense.
Let me worry about the offense.

450
00:23:29,754 --> 00:23:31,130
All right.

451
00:23:32,882 --> 00:23:34,133
Lastik!

452
00:23:39,848 --> 00:23:43,976
I want you to tell me something
about one of your black teammates.

453
00:23:44,227 --> 00:23:47,020
Sir, yes, sir! I'm rooming with Blue, sir,

454
00:23:47,105 --> 00:23:49,898
and I noticed he wears those
leopard-spotted underwears,

455
00:23:49,983 --> 00:23:51,275
bikini-style, sir!

456
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:54,319
Okay, maybe somebody
who's not your roommate.

457
00:23:54,404 --> 00:23:56,447
Sir, I eat lunch with Rev.

458
00:23:56,531 --> 00:23:58,490
That's Jerry Harris, sir!

459
00:23:58,575 --> 00:24:00,534
People call him Rev
'cause he's always praying,

460
00:24:00,618 --> 00:24:03,245
and he won't abide a foul tongue, sir!

461
00:24:03,621 --> 00:24:05,622
And what is the Rev gonna do
after high school?

462
00:24:05,707 --> 00:24:07,207
I don't know.

463
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:09,376
Go to college and all that, I guess.

464
00:24:09,461 --> 00:24:10,961
What about you?
You gonna go to college?

465
00:24:11,045 --> 00:24:14,006
Oh, not me, Coach.
I ain't a brainiac like Rev.

466
00:24:14,132 --> 00:24:15,466
Think you got a future in football?

467
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:18,510
Heck, no.
I just figure if I got to be in school

468
00:24:18,595 --> 00:24:20,387
I might as well
hit some people while I'm at it.

469
00:24:20,472 --> 00:24:22,222
All right, I like that.

470
00:24:22,307 --> 00:24:24,600
A self-aware man, I like that.

471
00:24:25,894 --> 00:24:26,935
But if you don't go to college,

472
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,729
it's not gonna be because
you're not qualified.

473
00:24:28,813 --> 00:24:30,564
So I want you to bring me
your test scores

474
00:24:30,648 --> 00:24:33,609
at the end of every week, and
we'll go over them together, okay?

475
00:24:33,693 --> 00:24:35,235
- Okay.
- We'll keep that between you and me.

476
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,403
Okay.

477
00:24:37,739 --> 00:24:39,740
So, what kind of music
does the Rev like?

478
00:24:39,824 --> 00:24:41,909
LOUIE: Me and Rev both
dig on The Temptations.

479
00:24:41,993 --> 00:24:42,951
Oh, yeah?

480
00:24:43,036 --> 00:24:45,078
I know you want to leave me

481
00:24:45,163 --> 00:24:49,124
But I refuse to let you go

482
00:24:49,209 --> 00:24:50,751
If I got to pray

483
00:24:50,835 --> 00:24:52,878
Plead for your sympathy

484
00:24:53,004 --> 00:24:54,463
I don't mind

485
00:24:54,547 --> 00:24:57,049
'Cause you mean that much to me

486
00:24:57,133 --> 00:24:58,884
Ain't too proud to beg

487
00:24:58,968 --> 00:25:01,178
Okay, all right. Stop begging.

488
00:25:01,471 --> 00:25:02,930
Anybody else?

489
00:25:06,184 --> 00:25:07,726
No volunteers?

490
00:25:10,939 --> 00:25:12,272
Campbell?

491
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:16,860
Bertier?

492
00:25:18,488 --> 00:25:19,780
No, huh?

493
00:25:23,409 --> 00:25:26,870
Each one of you
will spend time every day

494
00:25:28,206 --> 00:25:30,791
with a teammate of a different race.

495
00:25:30,917 --> 00:25:33,293
You will learn about him and his family,

496
00:25:33,378 --> 00:25:34,920
his likes, his dislikes.

497
00:25:35,004 --> 00:25:37,047
You will report back to me

498
00:25:37,966 --> 00:25:40,676
until you meet every one
of your teammates.

499
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,887
Until that time,
we go to three-a-day practices.

500
00:25:44,305 --> 00:25:47,182
You continue to ignore each other,
we'll go to four-a-day practices.

501
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:51,645
Now, is there any part of this
you don't understand?

502
00:25:51,729 --> 00:25:54,439
Let's see. What's your daddy's name?

503
00:25:54,566 --> 00:25:56,733
I mean, you do have a daddy, right?

504
00:25:56,818 --> 00:25:59,444
I have a father and his name is Eric.

505
00:25:59,904 --> 00:26:01,572
And what's he do?

506
00:26:01,698 --> 00:26:03,907
Wait, he does have a job, right?

507
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,916
Huh? Yes! This one.

508
00:26:13,001 --> 00:26:15,544
I don't even have to ask, but I will.

509
00:26:16,212 --> 00:26:18,046
What do you think of this one?

510
00:26:18,131 --> 00:26:20,090
Does the term
"cruel and unusual punishment"

511
00:26:20,174 --> 00:26:21,425
mean anything to you?

512
00:26:22,594 --> 00:26:24,511
Two minutes to go in the game.

513
00:26:24,596 --> 00:26:26,513
The other team is out there,
they're tired.

514
00:26:26,598 --> 00:26:30,183
Fourth quarter. Fourth quarter.
Fourth quarter.

515
00:26:30,268 --> 00:26:32,352
LOUIE: Nobody from my family
ever went to no college.

516
00:26:32,437 --> 00:26:34,688
- I'll tutor you, Louie.
- I'm white trash!

517
00:26:34,772 --> 00:26:39,151
I ain't gonna get no C-plus grades!
I'm just down-home, no-good,

518
00:26:39,235 --> 00:26:42,029
never-going-to-no-college
white trash, man! All right?

519
00:26:42,113 --> 00:26:43,614
Would you hurry up
and get off the phone?

520
00:26:43,698 --> 00:26:46,575
- I got to call my girl, too, man!
- Say it right now.

521
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:50,120
Oh, don't do this right now.

522
00:26:50,204 --> 00:26:51,872
Hey, man, what is this, Wild Kingdom?

523
00:26:51,956 --> 00:26:53,081
Shut up, y'all!

524
00:26:53,166 --> 00:26:54,791
Mating habits of the mountain gorillas?

525
00:26:54,876 --> 00:26:57,210
Gerry, you say it,
or I'm not hanging up the phone.

526
00:26:57,295 --> 00:26:58,962
Say it right now.

527
00:27:00,882 --> 00:27:02,549
I love you, sugar.

528
00:27:02,634 --> 00:27:03,634
"I love you, sugar!"

529
00:27:06,846 --> 00:27:08,221
- Let's go!
- Watch it! Watch it!

530
00:27:08,306 --> 00:27:10,641
Set! Hut!

531
00:27:13,561 --> 00:27:15,646
Get him! Get him! Get him!

532
00:27:16,564 --> 00:27:17,939
What are y'all doing?

533
00:27:18,024 --> 00:27:20,817
44 stack! You're supposed
to know your jobs!

534
00:27:20,902 --> 00:27:23,028
Campbell, you're playing selfish,
show-off football.

535
00:27:23,112 --> 00:27:25,781
- Hold your man down.
- Don't you single me out like that.

536
00:27:25,865 --> 00:27:27,324
What, you think
I'm stupid or something?

537
00:27:27,408 --> 00:27:30,744
Listen, I'm the team captain,
and I don't need you up in my face...

538
00:27:31,954 --> 00:27:33,789
We're here to play football, y'all.
Let's play football.

539
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:38,126
- Doc?
- I got it.

540
00:27:38,503 --> 00:27:42,255
Y'all didn't come out here to practice!
'Cause champions pay the price!

541
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,299
Lookin' like a bunch of bums out here!

542
00:27:44,384 --> 00:27:47,636
Let's go. Who's a coward?
Cowards won't block.

543
00:27:48,388 --> 00:27:50,222
Cowards won't tackle.

544
00:27:51,099 --> 00:27:52,891
Cowards won't go after fumbles.

545
00:27:52,975 --> 00:27:55,310
Coach, we need a water break.
We been out here all day.

546
00:27:56,729 --> 00:27:58,397
What did you say?

547
00:27:59,232 --> 00:28:01,817
- I said we need a water break.
- You need a water break.

548
00:28:01,901 --> 00:28:04,861
Water is for cowards.
Water makes you weak.

549
00:28:05,029 --> 00:28:07,280
Water is for washing blood
off that uniform,

550
00:28:07,365 --> 00:28:09,366
and you don't get
no blood on my uniform.

551
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:12,119
Boy, you must be outside your mind!

552
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:14,746
We are going to do up-downs

553
00:28:14,831 --> 00:28:18,458
until Blue is no longer tired and thirsty.

554
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,012
Coach!

555
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:38,353
There's a fine line
between tough and crazy,

556
00:28:38,438 --> 00:28:40,480
and you're flirting with it.

557
00:28:47,822 --> 00:28:49,948
All right, get some water.

558
00:28:51,993 --> 00:28:53,535
I'll take that.

559
00:28:54,829 --> 00:28:56,538
Hey, wait your turn, boy.

560
00:28:56,622 --> 00:28:58,623
Who you calling a boy, cracker?

561
00:29:01,085 --> 00:29:02,669
Quit it, jerks!

562
00:29:03,045 --> 00:29:05,964
Come on! You're all acting
like a bunch of sissies!

563
00:29:06,048 --> 00:29:07,257
Quit it!

564
00:29:16,017 --> 00:29:20,020
All right, man, listen.
I'm Gerry, you're Julius.

565
00:29:20,271 --> 00:29:23,273
Let's get some particulars
and just get this over with, all right?

566
00:29:23,357 --> 00:29:24,900
- Particulars?
- Yeah.

567
00:29:24,984 --> 00:29:26,067
No matter what I tell you,

568
00:29:26,152 --> 00:29:27,736
you ain't never gonna know
nothing about me.

569
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:30,822
Listen, I ain't runnin'
any more of these three-a-days, okay?

570
00:29:30,907 --> 00:29:32,407
What I got to say,
you really don't want to hear

571
00:29:32,492 --> 00:29:35,494
'cause honesty ain't too high
on your people's priority list.

572
00:29:35,578 --> 00:29:37,454
Honesty? You want honesty?

573
00:29:37,914 --> 00:29:40,874
All right, honestly,
I think you're nothing.

574
00:29:41,667 --> 00:29:44,085
Nothing but a pure waste
of God-given talent.

575
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:46,254
You don't listen to nobody, man.

576
00:29:46,339 --> 00:29:48,215
Not even Doc or Boone!

577
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:50,592
Shiver push on the line
every time, man.

578
00:29:50,927 --> 00:29:52,928
You blow right past 'em!

579
00:29:53,012 --> 00:29:55,514
Push 'em! Pull 'em! Do something!

580
00:29:56,182 --> 00:29:58,058
You can't run over
everybody in this league,

581
00:29:58,142 --> 00:30:00,519
and every time you do,
you leave one of your teammates

582
00:30:00,603 --> 00:30:02,854
hanging out to dry, me in particular!

583
00:30:02,939 --> 00:30:05,482
Why should I give a hoot
about you? Huh?

584
00:30:06,025 --> 00:30:08,068
Or anybody else out there?

585
00:30:08,194 --> 00:30:09,861
You want to talk about a waste,
you the captain, right?

586
00:30:09,946 --> 00:30:10,987
Right.

587
00:30:11,072 --> 00:30:12,405
Captain's supposed to be
the leader, right?

588
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:13,698
- You got a job?
- I have a job.

589
00:30:13,783 --> 00:30:15,826
- You been doing your job?
- I've been doing my job.

590
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,828
Then why don't you tell
your white buddies

591
00:30:17,912 --> 00:30:19,788
to block for Rev better?
'Cause they have not blocked

592
00:30:19,872 --> 00:30:22,874
for him worth a plugged nickel,
and you know it!

593
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:25,377
Nobody plays! Yourself included!

594
00:30:26,754 --> 00:30:29,339
I'm supposed to wear
myself out for the team?

595
00:30:29,423 --> 00:30:30,757
What team?

596
00:30:31,634 --> 00:30:34,177
No. No, what I'm gonna do is,

597
00:30:34,262 --> 00:30:35,929
I'm gonna look out for myself,

598
00:30:36,013 --> 00:30:37,931
and I'm gonna get mine.

599
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,350
See, man?

600
00:30:40,601 --> 00:30:43,353
That's the worst attitude I ever heard.

601
00:30:44,814 --> 00:30:47,482
Attitude reflects leadership, Captain.

602
00:30:56,993 --> 00:31:01,538
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go!

603
00:31:01,706 --> 00:31:03,331
Wake up, gentlemen, it's late.

604
00:31:03,416 --> 00:31:05,542
It's 3:00 a.m. in the morning.

605
00:31:06,043 --> 00:31:07,752
All right, listen up.

606
00:31:07,837 --> 00:31:11,464
You will follow Doc, myself,
and the other coaches.

607
00:31:11,549 --> 00:31:13,466
We're gonna take a little run
through the woods.

608
00:31:13,551 --> 00:31:15,552
If you get lost along the way,

609
00:31:15,636 --> 00:31:17,637
don't bother coming back to camp.

610
00:31:17,722 --> 00:31:20,181
Just hitchhike your hindparts on home.

611
00:31:20,266 --> 00:31:21,266
Any questions?

612
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:23,059
Coach, this is a high school
football team.

613
00:31:23,144 --> 00:31:25,395
We're not in the marines here.

614
00:31:26,981 --> 00:31:28,315
Let's go.

615
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:30,483
Let's go.

616
00:32:05,853 --> 00:32:07,020
- Oh, no, no.
- Shoot!

617
00:32:07,104 --> 00:32:09,522
Come on, baby. Can't take no rest.

618
00:32:25,081 --> 00:32:27,415
Anybody know what this place is?

619
00:32:31,087 --> 00:32:32,879
This is Gettysburg.

620
00:32:33,422 --> 00:32:36,716
This is where they fought
the Battle of Gettysburg.

621
00:32:37,385 --> 00:32:42,097
Fifty thousand men died right here
on this field,

622
00:32:42,807 --> 00:32:44,808
fighting the same fight

623
00:32:46,185 --> 00:32:48,895
that we're still fighting
amongst ourselves

624
00:32:50,231 --> 00:32:51,439
today.

625
00:32:52,274 --> 00:32:54,401
This green field right here

626
00:32:54,527 --> 00:32:55,860
was painted red.

627
00:32:55,945 --> 00:32:59,114
Bubbling with the blood of young boys.

628
00:33:00,825 --> 00:33:02,075
Smoke

629
00:33:04,704 --> 00:33:07,831
and hot lead
pouring right through their bodies.

630
00:33:11,085 --> 00:33:13,211
Listen to their souls, men.

631
00:33:13,337 --> 00:33:16,840
"I killed my brother with
malice in my heart."

632
00:33:17,675 --> 00:33:21,594
"Hatred destroyed my family."

633
00:33:24,598 --> 00:33:26,099
You listen

634
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:31,062
and you take a lesson from the dead.

635
00:33:33,649 --> 00:33:35,859
If we don't come together,

636
00:33:37,111 --> 00:33:39,779
right now, on this hallowed ground,

637
00:33:40,781 --> 00:33:43,116
then we, too, will be destroyed.

638
00:33:45,703 --> 00:33:47,495
Just like they were.

639
00:33:48,664 --> 00:33:51,207
I don't care if you like each other or not,

640
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:53,626
but you will respect each other.

641
00:33:53,711 --> 00:33:55,128
And maybe...

642
00:33:55,546 --> 00:33:57,714
I don't know, maybe we'll

643
00:34:00,259 --> 00:34:02,552
learn to play this game like men.

644
00:34:02,636 --> 00:34:03,762
Hut!

645
00:34:05,973 --> 00:34:07,474
Here we go!

646
00:34:11,145 --> 00:34:12,520
All right.

647
00:34:13,147 --> 00:34:15,315
We'll be out here all night,
until we get this thing right.

648
00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:17,108
- Let's go.
- BERTIER: Let's go, team, pick it up!

649
00:34:17,193 --> 00:34:19,819
- On the ball, Rev.
- BERTIER: Come on, everybody.

650
00:34:19,987 --> 00:34:21,946
- Get it right!
- BERTIER: Ready!

651
00:34:24,116 --> 00:34:25,200
Set!

652
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,411
- Check Blue!
- There it is.

653
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,622
Let's go! Hut!

654
00:34:33,542 --> 00:34:34,667
Go! Go!

655
00:34:38,714 --> 00:34:40,090
What was that, Ray?

656
00:34:40,174 --> 00:34:41,716
Whatever it is, it ain't blockin'!

657
00:34:41,801 --> 00:34:42,926
Give me a break, Gerry.

658
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:44,677
You want a break? I'll give you a break!

659
00:34:44,762 --> 00:34:46,387
Wait a minute, wait, wait.
Let them handle this.

660
00:34:46,472 --> 00:34:47,889
If they get to Rev once, just one time,

661
00:34:47,973 --> 00:34:49,349
I swear to God,
I'm gonna hit you so hard,

662
00:34:49,433 --> 00:34:50,767
by the time you come to,

663
00:34:50,851 --> 00:34:52,352
ooh, boy,
you're gonna need a new haircut.

664
00:34:52,436 --> 00:34:54,145
You understand me?

665
00:34:55,815 --> 00:34:57,565
BERTIER: Let's play, fellas!

666
00:34:58,984 --> 00:35:01,194
On the ball. Let's run it again.

667
00:35:03,989 --> 00:35:05,865
Ready!

668
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:07,200
All right.

669
00:35:07,284 --> 00:35:08,868
Set!

670
00:35:10,204 --> 00:35:11,287
Hut!

671
00:35:17,795 --> 00:35:19,212
Get off me!

672
00:35:20,464 --> 00:35:22,382
You all right, big Petey? You all right?

673
00:35:22,466 --> 00:35:24,008
You really stuck him, Campbell.

674
00:35:24,093 --> 00:35:26,344
Yeah, I love me a little contact, Petey!

675
00:35:26,428 --> 00:35:28,096
This is left side!

676
00:35:32,393 --> 00:35:36,104
- Strong side!
- Left side!

677
00:35:36,188 --> 00:35:37,272
Strong side!

678
00:35:37,356 --> 00:35:38,398
Left side!

679
00:35:38,482 --> 00:35:39,858
- Strong side!
- Left side!

680
00:35:39,942 --> 00:35:41,067
Strong side!

681
00:35:49,535 --> 00:35:51,119
BERTIER: What wins games?
- Defense!

682
00:35:51,203 --> 00:35:52,745
- What wins games?
- Defense!

683
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:55,081
BERTIER: What wins games?
- Defense!

684
00:36:10,472 --> 00:36:11,931
Hey, fellas.

685
00:36:12,099 --> 00:36:13,224
Look at that fruitcake.

686
00:36:14,435 --> 00:36:16,060
Gerry, just keep your mouth shut

687
00:36:16,145 --> 00:36:17,395
and get back on that field.

688
00:36:17,479 --> 00:36:19,731
Coach Boone, I'm Colonel Bass.

689
00:36:19,815 --> 00:36:21,691
I just got transferred here
from Huntington Beach, California.

690
00:36:21,775 --> 00:36:23,610
This is my son Ronnie,
and he's a quarterback.

691
00:36:23,694 --> 00:36:26,029
How you doing, Ronnie?
This is Coach Yoast.

692
00:36:26,113 --> 00:36:27,155
My pleasure.

693
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:29,073
We're pretty set
at the quarterback, Colonel,

694
00:36:29,158 --> 00:36:31,117
but, if the boy's any good,

695
00:36:31,202 --> 00:36:33,411
you may want to check out
Wilson or Hamilton.

696
00:36:33,495 --> 00:36:35,747
Well, I met Coach Taber.

697
00:36:35,831 --> 00:36:37,624
He won't let blacks play on his team.

698
00:36:37,708 --> 00:36:40,251
The way I see it,
if these boys can fight a war together,

699
00:36:40,336 --> 00:36:42,086
they can play football together.

700
00:36:42,171 --> 00:36:43,755
Now, he's a pretty good runner.

701
00:36:52,181 --> 00:36:53,806
Yeah, a fruitcake, huh?

702
00:36:55,434 --> 00:36:57,894
I think we can find
a place for your boy.

703
00:36:58,562 --> 00:37:00,688
With one or two conditions.

704
00:37:03,234 --> 00:37:04,776
Hey, Sunshine.

705
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:11,282
Sunshine.

706
00:37:11,367 --> 00:37:12,617
Hey, man, all that rubbin'

707
00:37:12,701 --> 00:37:13,826
ain't gonna make them golden locks

708
00:37:13,911 --> 00:37:16,412
grow back no faster now.
You know that, huh?

709
00:37:17,623 --> 00:37:21,125
Sunshine, Sunshine, Sunshine

710
00:37:21,669 --> 00:37:23,336
- Sunshine?
- Sunshine.

711
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:25,797
Yeah. Choke it up, huh?

712
00:37:26,048 --> 00:37:28,091
That's cool. I can dig it.

713
00:37:29,718 --> 00:37:32,679
SUNSHINE: Come on, now.
Don't leave me hangin', bro. Come on.

714
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:34,847
Hey, he got a little soul power.

715
00:37:34,932 --> 00:37:36,474
Look at this man here.

716
00:37:36,558 --> 00:37:39,060
He called me "bro"!

717
00:37:39,353 --> 00:37:40,436
Hey, but, hey,

718
00:37:40,521 --> 00:37:42,188
I liked him better
with the long hair, bro.

719
00:37:42,273 --> 00:37:44,565
Reminded me of Bertier's mama.

720
00:37:46,235 --> 00:37:47,735
What? What?

721
00:37:47,987 --> 00:37:49,696
Now, how do you know
what Bertier's mama looks like?

722
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:52,448
Brother, don't you know,
me and Bertier's mama

723
00:37:52,574 --> 00:37:55,201
went out on the town last night, bro?

724
00:37:55,744 --> 00:37:58,037
- What are you say...
- Hold up, hold up. Listen, now, Blue.

725
00:37:58,122 --> 00:37:59,789
Why are you talking about
Bertier's mama like that?

726
00:37:59,873 --> 00:38:01,582
See, now,
you making me angry, man.

727
00:38:01,667 --> 00:38:03,376
Look like I ain't gonna
be able to take your mama

728
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,544
to the prom no more.

729
00:38:05,754 --> 00:38:07,046
What you laughin' at, Jerry Buck?

730
00:38:07,131 --> 00:38:09,799
You need to tell your mama
to shave them old legs of hers, bro.

731
00:38:09,883 --> 00:38:11,217
And, Julius, when she's done,

732
00:38:11,302 --> 00:38:12,885
maybe your mama
can borrow the razor

733
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:16,139
and shave that old nasty back of hers.

734
00:38:17,224 --> 00:38:18,558
Wait, wait, wait.

735
00:38:18,642 --> 00:38:21,477
You mad because
she lookin' like a wolfman, bro.

736
00:38:21,895 --> 00:38:24,230
Hey, hey. Lastik, man,
what happened to you?

737
00:38:24,315 --> 00:38:26,649
Man, I just gave your
mama a piggyback ride,

738
00:38:26,734 --> 00:38:29,694
and she weighs twice as much as I do.

739
00:38:31,196 --> 00:38:32,864
That ain't funny.

740
00:38:33,365 --> 00:38:35,116
That's a mama joke.

741
00:38:40,831 --> 00:38:43,541
Listen, baby

742
00:38:43,667 --> 00:38:45,460
Ain't no mountain high

743
00:38:45,544 --> 00:38:47,420
Ain't no valley low

744
00:38:47,504 --> 00:38:50,798
Ain't no river wide enough, baby

745
00:38:50,883 --> 00:38:53,343
If you need me, call me

746
00:38:53,427 --> 00:38:55,136
No matter where you are

747
00:38:55,262 --> 00:38:57,055
No matter how far

748
00:38:57,139 --> 00:38:58,681
No, no, darlin'

749
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:00,600
Just call my name

750
00:39:00,684 --> 00:39:02,602
I'll be there
in a hurry

751
00:39:02,686 --> 00:39:04,354
You don't have
to worry

752
00:39:04,563 --> 00:39:05,730
'Cause, baby, there

753
00:39:05,814 --> 00:39:07,190
Ain't no mountain
high enough

754
00:39:07,274 --> 00:39:08,816
So, Julius,
I was thinking that we...

755
00:39:08,901 --> 00:39:10,651
He's in the shower.

756
00:39:13,113 --> 00:39:14,739
What do you want, man?

757
00:39:15,074 --> 00:39:16,908
You know what I want.

758
00:39:31,465 --> 00:39:32,965
Hey, Bertier!

759
00:39:33,926 --> 00:39:35,093
Get off! Get off!

760
00:39:35,177 --> 00:39:37,261
You have no idea
who you messed with, man!

761
00:39:37,346 --> 00:39:39,305
There's too much male bonding
going on in here for me.

762
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:40,973
I'm out. You dig?

763
00:39:41,058 --> 00:39:42,141
BERTIER: All right!

764
00:39:42,226 --> 00:39:43,643
What is going on here?

765
00:39:46,021 --> 00:39:47,438
He kissed me, man!

766
00:39:52,486 --> 00:39:55,780
Ain't no mountain high enough

767
00:39:56,156 --> 00:39:59,367
Ain't no valley low enough

768
00:39:59,868 --> 00:40:03,121
Ain't no river wide enough

769
00:40:03,288 --> 00:40:06,207
To keep me from getting to you

770
00:40:06,291 --> 00:40:07,917
- Ronnie Bass.
- Yes, sir.

771
00:40:08,001 --> 00:40:10,670
I like that haircut. Get in there and
show me what you got. Option eleven.

772
00:40:10,754 --> 00:40:11,963
Let's go, baby.
Rookie quarterback.

773
00:40:12,047 --> 00:40:13,965
Side field, come on.

774
00:40:14,049 --> 00:40:15,258
BERTIER: Left! Left!

775
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:18,678
Set! Hut!

776
00:40:20,806 --> 00:40:22,348
Ball! Ball! Ball!

777
00:40:22,683 --> 00:40:24,016
Hard step.

778
00:40:25,102 --> 00:40:26,686
Read the tackle.

779
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:28,020
- Got to see the pitch, all right?
- Yes, sir.

780
00:40:28,105 --> 00:40:30,857
Now, you can throw it a mile,
but you can't pitch it three yards.

781
00:40:30,941 --> 00:40:32,942
Gotta see it. If you don't read it,
you weave 'em.

782
00:40:33,026 --> 00:40:34,360
- Rev!
- Yes, sir!

783
00:40:35,821 --> 00:40:37,780
- Show him how.
- Yes, sir.

784
00:40:41,493 --> 00:40:43,327
JULIUS: You want this milk, Bertier?

785
00:40:43,412 --> 00:40:45,621
Yeah, I'll take your milk.

786
00:40:45,706 --> 00:40:50,168
- Hey, can you slide a bit, Gerry?
- Hey, Ray, this is the defensive table.

787
00:40:54,173 --> 00:40:56,549
- Hi, Petey.
- What's up, man?

788
00:40:56,633 --> 00:40:58,301
Hey, Sunshine.

789
00:40:59,386 --> 00:41:03,556
It's not like I care or nothing,
but being your roommate and all,

790
00:41:03,807 --> 00:41:05,516
you was just messing
with Bertier, right?

791
00:41:05,601 --> 00:41:07,685
You was just messing
with his mind, right?

792
00:41:07,769 --> 00:41:09,061
You're not really...

793
00:41:09,146 --> 00:41:11,564
What are you talking about, Petey?

794
00:41:11,648 --> 00:41:13,483
Look, man, it don't matter to me,
you know?

795
00:41:13,567 --> 00:41:16,444
If, you know, if...
I just got to know, you know?

796
00:41:16,653 --> 00:41:19,405
If it don't matter, what's the big deal?

797
00:41:20,073 --> 00:41:22,909
- I got to know.
- Know what?

798
00:41:22,993 --> 00:41:25,495
You know what I got to know?
Don't mess with my mind!

799
00:41:25,579 --> 00:41:28,998
Looks like Coach been keeping Petey
out in the sun for too long, bro.

800
00:41:29,082 --> 00:41:33,002
- Coach.
- Hey, sweetie. Sit down.

801
00:41:33,086 --> 00:41:35,338
- Have my dessert.
- Coach Boone?

802
00:41:36,632 --> 00:41:38,591
You did a good job up here.

803
00:41:38,675 --> 00:41:41,427
You ran a tough camp,
from what I can see.

804
00:41:41,762 --> 00:41:45,264
Well, I'm very happy to have
the approval of a five-year-old.

805
00:41:45,349 --> 00:41:48,100
I'm nine and a half,
thank you very much.

806
00:41:48,936 --> 00:41:52,021
Why don't you get this little girl some
pretty dolls or something, Coach?

807
00:41:52,105 --> 00:41:54,148
I tried. She loves football.

808
00:41:54,233 --> 00:41:55,608
What are you?

809
00:41:55,692 --> 00:41:58,486
Mobile! Agile! Hostile!

810
00:41:58,987 --> 00:42:00,238
What is pain?

811
00:42:00,322 --> 00:42:01,822
French bread!

812
00:42:01,907 --> 00:42:04,325
- What is fatigue?
- Army clothes!

813
00:42:05,118 --> 00:42:08,621
- Will you ever quit?
- No!

814
00:42:08,705 --> 00:42:11,123
We want some more!
We want some more!

815
00:42:11,208 --> 00:42:12,625
We want some more!

816
00:42:12,751 --> 00:42:14,043
Turn in!

817
00:42:23,178 --> 00:42:25,471
Let me ask you something,
Mr. Campbell.

818
00:42:25,722 --> 00:42:27,723
What kind of power you got?

819
00:42:27,808 --> 00:42:30,309
Oh, man, you know
I got some soul power.

820
00:42:30,394 --> 00:42:31,811
What kind of power you got?

821
00:42:31,895 --> 00:42:34,146
What kind of question is that?
I got soul power!

822
00:42:34,231 --> 00:42:35,648
- Yes, you do!
- Right on!

823
00:42:35,732 --> 00:42:37,650
Let me ask you something
now, Mr. Bertier.

824
00:42:37,734 --> 00:42:39,860
- How strong are you?
- I'm too strong!

825
00:42:39,945 --> 00:42:41,821
- What?
- I'm too strong!

826
00:42:41,905 --> 00:42:44,031
- How strong?
- Too strong!

827
00:42:44,116 --> 00:42:45,491
I want a victory!

828
00:42:45,576 --> 00:42:46,659
Oh, I want a victory!

829
00:42:46,743 --> 00:42:47,743
I want a victory!

830
00:42:47,828 --> 00:42:48,953
No, I want a victory!

831
00:42:49,037 --> 00:42:50,162
You all want a victory?

832
00:42:50,247 --> 00:42:51,330
Yeah!

833
00:42:51,415 --> 00:42:52,540
You all want a victory?

834
00:42:52,624 --> 00:42:53,749
Yeah!

835
00:42:59,673 --> 00:43:01,841
Goodbye

836
00:43:01,925 --> 00:43:03,509
Na na na na

837
00:43:03,594 --> 00:43:05,553
Hey, hey, hey

838
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:06,804
Goodbye

839
00:43:06,972 --> 00:43:09,307
Let me hear you!

840
00:43:09,391 --> 00:43:11,058
Up in the front!
Up in the front!

841
00:43:11,143 --> 00:43:12,184
Whole school!

842
00:43:12,269 --> 00:43:13,352
Hey, hey, hey

843
00:43:13,437 --> 00:43:15,855
What'd they do up there,
brainwash 'em?

844
00:43:15,981 --> 00:43:18,232
They must be high
on something.

845
00:43:22,571 --> 00:43:24,614
- Hey, Mom.
- Welcome home.

846
00:43:25,032 --> 00:43:26,198
Dad.

847
00:43:27,701 --> 00:43:30,286
- How you doing, sweetheart?
- I missed you so much.

848
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:32,496
Hey, man. Look, are we cool?

849
00:43:32,873 --> 00:43:34,665
Yeah, we're cool, man.

850
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:36,334
- Mrs. Boone, nice to meet you.
- You, too.

851
00:43:36,418 --> 00:43:38,169
Yeah, this is little Karen.

852
00:43:38,253 --> 00:43:40,504
This is Nicky. Nicky, that's Sheryl.

853
00:43:40,589 --> 00:43:42,632
Why do you dress so weird?

854
00:43:44,843 --> 00:43:46,552
Look who's talking.

855
00:43:48,722 --> 00:43:50,890
Well, we're just all getting along,
aren't we?

856
00:43:50,974 --> 00:43:52,558
We don't want you!

857
00:43:54,227 --> 00:43:55,561
Get out!

858
00:43:57,731 --> 00:44:00,024
We don't want them here!

859
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:12,912
LOUIE: What you doing
in my school, boy?

860
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:15,039
Man, this stuff is messed up.

861
00:44:15,123 --> 00:44:16,749
Yeah, anything serious happen,

862
00:44:16,833 --> 00:44:18,084
they shut the school down,

863
00:44:18,168 --> 00:44:19,752
and our season go down the drain.

864
00:44:19,836 --> 00:44:21,504
This here's real messed up.

865
00:44:21,588 --> 00:44:24,590
But there are a lot
of pretty women here.

866
00:44:25,384 --> 00:44:26,425
BERTIER: Hey.

867
00:44:27,552 --> 00:44:29,303
Look at 'em, Gerry.

868
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:31,639
They hate us.

869
00:44:31,765 --> 00:44:35,267
Nah. Just a bad day.
Things'll cool down.

870
00:44:35,936 --> 00:44:38,312
No, Gerry.
They're always gonna hate us.

871
00:44:39,981 --> 00:44:42,441
We don't need you here,
either, hippie boy.

872
00:44:42,609 --> 00:44:44,485
You hear what he said?

873
00:44:46,154 --> 00:44:48,280
- Hey, man.
- Hey, Julius.

874
00:44:48,365 --> 00:44:50,616
Man, it's crazy out here, man.

875
00:44:50,701 --> 00:44:52,576
Yeah, well, what did you expect?

876
00:44:52,661 --> 00:44:55,871
I don't know.
I ain't quite expect it to be like this.

877
00:44:55,956 --> 00:44:59,417
Sorry. Julius, this is Emma.

878
00:45:08,635 --> 00:45:10,428
Camp over now, huh?

879
00:45:11,471 --> 00:45:13,222
Back to the real world, Bertier.

880
00:45:14,266 --> 00:45:16,642
This is what they're integrating us for?

881
00:45:16,727 --> 00:45:19,812
We'd have been better off
staying where we were.

882
00:45:33,243 --> 00:45:35,870
Yeah, this is my sanctuary right here.

883
00:45:38,582 --> 00:45:41,125
All this hatred and turmoil
swirling around us,

884
00:45:41,209 --> 00:45:43,502
but this... This is always right.

885
00:45:44,129 --> 00:45:45,379
Struggle.

886
00:45:46,006 --> 00:45:47,339
Survival.

887
00:45:48,216 --> 00:45:50,009
Victory and defeat.

888
00:45:54,222 --> 00:45:56,182
It's just a game, Doc, but...

889
00:45:58,518 --> 00:45:59,852
I love it.

890
00:46:01,855 --> 00:46:05,357
Coach, I'm afraid I've put you
into a no-win situation.

891
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:08,319
I just found out the board
didn't even think

892
00:46:08,403 --> 00:46:09,862
you'd make it out of camp.

893
00:46:09,946 --> 00:46:11,363
And now that you have,

894
00:46:11,448 --> 00:46:13,282
I've learned that
at the first sign of trouble...

895
00:46:13,366 --> 00:46:14,867
Trouble? What kind of trouble?

896
00:46:14,951 --> 00:46:16,452
Lose a game,

897
00:46:17,204 --> 00:46:18,871
they'll fire you

898
00:46:19,122 --> 00:46:21,373
and turn it back over
to Yoast.

899
00:46:21,666 --> 00:46:23,667
One game,
just like that?

900
00:46:24,336 --> 00:46:26,170
What about my family?

901
00:46:26,296 --> 00:46:27,338
We just got here.

902
00:46:27,422 --> 00:46:28,672
They just expect me
to pick up and move?

903
00:46:28,757 --> 00:46:30,007
What about my girls?

904
00:46:30,091 --> 00:46:32,009
I don't know what to say, I...

905
00:46:33,887 --> 00:46:35,554
I'm sorry, Coach.

906
00:46:35,639 --> 00:46:39,391
Pump, pump,
pump it up!

907
00:46:39,476 --> 00:46:41,644
Pump that Titan spirit up!

908
00:46:41,728 --> 00:46:42,853
Look at 'em.

909
00:46:42,938 --> 00:46:47,441
They come here to watch the game,
and they still don't want no part of us.

910
00:46:59,412 --> 00:47:02,623
Give us more.
Do your stuff, let's go!

911
00:47:11,424 --> 00:47:13,509
All right, everybody on their feet.
On your feet, on your feet.

912
00:47:13,593 --> 00:47:15,219
Let's go, let's go.

913
00:47:16,638 --> 00:47:17,930
Listen up.

914
00:47:18,014 --> 00:47:20,266
I'm not gonna talk
to you tonight about

915
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:22,101
winning and losing.

916
00:47:22,769 --> 00:47:24,728
You're already winners,

917
00:47:25,355 --> 00:47:28,315
'cause you didn't
kill each other up at camp.

918
00:47:28,942 --> 00:47:30,985
Tonight, we got Hayfield.

919
00:47:32,112 --> 00:47:35,739
Like all the other schools
in this conference, they're all white.

920
00:47:36,241 --> 00:47:38,784
They don't have to worry about race.

921
00:47:38,869 --> 00:47:40,035
We do.

922
00:47:41,663 --> 00:47:43,914
But we're better for it, men.

923
00:47:44,791 --> 00:47:47,710
Let me tell you something.
You don't let anything,

924
00:47:47,794 --> 00:47:49,128
nothing,

925
00:47:50,422 --> 00:47:53,132
come between us.
Nothing tears us apart.

926
00:47:53,383 --> 00:47:54,466
Greek mythology,

927
00:47:54,551 --> 00:47:57,386
the titans were greater
even than the gods.

928
00:47:57,804 --> 00:48:00,222
They ruled their universe
with absolute power.

929
00:48:00,307 --> 00:48:02,057
Well, that football field
out there tonight,

930
00:48:02,142 --> 00:48:03,976
that's our universe.

931
00:48:04,477 --> 00:48:05,811
Let's rule it like titans.

932
00:48:06,646 --> 00:48:07,855
Got it!

933
00:48:14,613 --> 00:48:15,821
So the Titans defense

934
00:48:15,906 --> 00:48:17,531
takes the field for the first time

935
00:48:17,616 --> 00:48:18,908
against the Hayfield Hawks,

936
00:48:18,992 --> 00:48:21,076
Ied by quarterback Daniel Cullum

937
00:48:21,161 --> 00:48:23,537
on the Hawks' 32-yard line.

938
00:48:26,416 --> 00:48:29,668
We're moving like molasses out there,
for crying out loud!

939
00:48:29,753 --> 00:48:31,295
I mean, come on!

940
00:48:34,507 --> 00:48:36,091
Mama.

941
00:48:36,468 --> 00:48:39,845
- Are all white girls that crazy?
- What?

942
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:42,348
You guys can do better than that...

943
00:48:43,141 --> 00:48:44,183
Yeah!

944
00:48:44,267 --> 00:48:46,143
Huddle up. Fellas, huddle up.

945
00:48:46,227 --> 00:48:47,686
Bosley? Where's Alan?

946
00:48:47,771 --> 00:48:49,647
Alan, you've got to stick your man!

947
00:48:49,731 --> 00:48:51,065
They're gonna score on us
all night if you don't...

948
00:48:51,149 --> 00:48:52,650
He's too fast, Gerry.
I can't stick with him.

949
00:48:52,734 --> 00:48:54,401
Let's go, let's go!

950
00:48:54,486 --> 00:48:56,070
22! Hut!

951
00:49:01,868 --> 00:49:03,535
Touchdown, Hawks!

952
00:49:09,459 --> 00:49:12,503
- Shape up that defense, Yoast.
- You just worry about your offense.

953
00:49:12,587 --> 00:49:14,046
Hey, they score again, I'm taking over.

954
00:49:19,719 --> 00:49:21,095
Ready!

955
00:49:21,179 --> 00:49:22,513
That's it!

956
00:49:22,597 --> 00:49:23,764
Watch him! Watch him!

957
00:49:23,848 --> 00:49:24,848
Set!

958
00:49:26,059 --> 00:49:27,351
Hut! Hut!

959
00:49:33,566 --> 00:49:35,067
Petey, get over here!
What are you doing, son?

960
00:49:35,151 --> 00:49:37,152
You missed the block by a mile.

961
00:49:37,404 --> 00:49:39,530
You didn't even have the
football to fumble this time.

962
00:49:39,614 --> 00:49:41,156
There's no excuse! No excuse!

963
00:49:41,241 --> 00:49:43,325
You want to play football or not?

964
00:49:43,451 --> 00:49:47,037
Do you want to play football...
Boy, get over there on the bench.

965
00:49:49,207 --> 00:49:50,874
Herb, take over for me.

966
00:49:50,959 --> 00:49:52,126
You got it.

967
00:49:53,253 --> 00:49:55,254
Petey! You all right?

968
00:49:56,464 --> 00:49:59,174
I was a two-year starter at G.W.

969
00:49:59,259 --> 00:50:00,592
All this yelling he's doing,

970
00:50:00,677 --> 00:50:02,344
it don't do nothing
but make me play worse.

971
00:50:02,429 --> 00:50:03,595
I can't play for this man.

972
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,639
You come play linebacker for me.

973
00:50:05,724 --> 00:50:07,725
23's killing us.
I want you to get out there,

974
00:50:07,809 --> 00:50:09,935
I want you to cover him for me.

975
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:11,770
- You want me to go in now?
- Yeah.

976
00:50:11,855 --> 00:50:13,731
I can't! I...

977
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:15,983
I haven't practiced with the defense.
I can't.

978
00:50:16,067 --> 00:50:17,735
That doesn't matter.
I just want you to get out there.

979
00:50:17,819 --> 00:50:19,486
I want you to cover 23.
That's all you have to do.

980
00:50:19,571 --> 00:50:22,740
We'll talk about the rest of it
when we put this one away.

981
00:50:22,824 --> 00:50:24,825
You think Yoast is trying to
let them score on purpose?

982
00:50:24,909 --> 00:50:25,909
What?

983
00:50:25,994 --> 00:50:28,162
- Do you?
- Oh, come on, Herman.

984
00:50:28,788 --> 00:50:30,080
Okay, let's go.

985
00:50:32,876 --> 00:50:35,127
What is Petey doing in there?

986
00:50:37,881 --> 00:50:40,924
HINDS: Looks like Yoast
is trying him out on defense.

987
00:50:41,718 --> 00:50:43,844
He's taking Alan out. Yoast!

988
00:50:44,804 --> 00:50:46,346
Herman, Herman, Herman.

989
00:50:46,431 --> 00:50:48,223
Come on. Let's see.
Let's see what happens.

990
00:50:48,308 --> 00:50:49,475
- It might be all right.
- Yoast!

991
00:50:49,559 --> 00:50:52,061
It's okay. You're okay.
You're okay. Okay.

992
00:50:52,145 --> 00:50:53,771
Don't you take out my son!

993
00:50:53,855 --> 00:50:56,315
He's getting beat like
he stole something, Mr. Bosley.

994
00:50:56,399 --> 00:50:57,983
You just stay out of it, girl!

995
00:50:58,068 --> 00:50:59,693
He's just getting beat,
that's all I'm saying.

996
00:50:59,778 --> 00:51:00,861
Yoast!

997
00:51:02,072 --> 00:51:04,448
Set! 22! Hut! Hut!

998
00:51:12,749 --> 00:51:14,416
HINDS: Yeah!

999
00:51:14,501 --> 00:51:15,667
Down!

1000
00:51:19,214 --> 00:51:21,090
Hut! Hut, hut!

1001
00:51:35,063 --> 00:51:36,230
Go, defense.

1002
00:51:38,983 --> 00:51:39,983
Set!

1003
00:51:40,068 --> 00:51:41,151
Hut!

1004
00:51:54,374 --> 00:51:56,125
Yeah!

1005
00:51:59,337 --> 00:52:01,964
Touchdown!
Game, Titans!

1006
00:52:02,382 --> 00:52:03,882
Yeah!

1007
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:06,718
The Titans are here, y'all,
and we ain't going nowhere.

1008
00:52:06,803 --> 00:52:08,387
Yo, you got to be loud
all the time, man?

1009
00:52:08,471 --> 00:52:09,721
Virginia can hear you, baby.

1010
00:52:09,806 --> 00:52:11,265
I think they all heard you fumble, man.

1011
00:52:11,349 --> 00:52:13,767
First of all, the hand.
Second of all, who won the game?

1012
00:52:13,852 --> 00:52:14,977
My dad is...

1013
00:52:15,061 --> 00:52:16,478
Don't worry about it. It's not your fault.

1014
00:52:16,563 --> 00:52:18,188
They like to show off,

1015
00:52:18,273 --> 00:52:19,356
and that's what they do.

1016
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,316
Wait, wait, wait. "They"?

1017
00:52:21,401 --> 00:52:23,068
- Yeah. What?
- I heard you say "they."

1018
00:52:23,153 --> 00:52:25,070
Yeah, they. Them. Them over there.

1019
00:52:25,155 --> 00:52:26,947
But what you mean by "they"...
You talking about Pete...

1020
00:52:27,031 --> 00:52:28,448
JULIUS: You're you, and they are them.

1021
00:52:29,826 --> 00:52:30,993
Gerry.

1022
00:52:32,036 --> 00:52:34,079
Hey, Gerry. Hop in, buddy.

1023
00:52:36,124 --> 00:52:39,585
We're heading over to the hill, Gerry.
Everyone's gonna be there.

1024
00:52:39,669 --> 00:52:41,253
Why don't you hang out
down here with us?

1025
00:52:41,337 --> 00:52:42,880
We're... You know...

1026
00:52:43,506 --> 00:52:45,257
What are you trying to do, Gerry?

1027
00:52:45,341 --> 00:52:47,926
Listen, when
something unexpected comes,

1028
00:52:48,011 --> 00:52:50,012
you just got to pick it up and run with it.

1029
00:52:50,096 --> 00:52:54,057
I'm not running in the same
direction as you are, Gerry.

1030
00:52:54,142 --> 00:52:55,601
Come with us.

1031
00:52:56,769 --> 00:53:00,022
Look, standing up
for what you believe in,

1032
00:53:00,148 --> 00:53:02,065
it's all well and good, but...

1033
00:53:03,067 --> 00:53:06,612
you got your priorities
real mixed up this time.

1034
00:53:07,197 --> 00:53:09,323
Are you coming or not, man?

1035
00:53:23,963 --> 00:53:25,631
Petey Jones.

1036
00:53:25,715 --> 00:53:26,673
Come on, man.

1037
00:53:26,758 --> 00:53:27,799
No, man.

1038
00:53:27,884 --> 00:53:30,135
What, man? It's on me, man.
We party on. Let's go.

1039
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:32,304
Look... Look here, man, all right?

1040
00:53:32,388 --> 00:53:34,556
This here's Virginia. All right?

1041
00:53:34,641 --> 00:53:37,059
They got problems with, you know...

1042
00:53:37,143 --> 00:53:38,518
They don't want us in there, man.

1043
00:53:38,603 --> 00:53:40,479
Oh, man, that's history, bro.
It's on me. Come on.

1044
00:53:53,201 --> 00:53:55,244
We're full tonight, boys.

1045
00:53:55,703 --> 00:53:58,121
What? There's tables
all over the place, man.

1046
00:53:58,206 --> 00:53:59,414
What are you talking about?

1047
00:53:59,499 --> 00:54:01,625
Well, this is my establishment.

1048
00:54:01,709 --> 00:54:04,795
I reserve the right
to refuse service to anybody.

1049
00:54:04,879 --> 00:54:07,506
Yeah, that means you, too, hippie boy.

1050
00:54:07,632 --> 00:54:09,091
Now, y'all want something to eat,

1051
00:54:09,175 --> 00:54:12,052
you can take these boys out back
and pick it up from the kitchen.

1052
00:54:12,136 --> 00:54:13,804
What'd I tell you, man?

1053
00:54:13,888 --> 00:54:15,138
Yo, come on, Petey, man!

1054
00:54:15,223 --> 00:54:16,265
Petey, I didn't know, man.

1055
00:54:16,349 --> 00:54:18,684
I told you!
What you mean you didn't know?

1056
00:54:18,768 --> 00:54:19,935
You think I was playing with you?

1057
00:54:20,019 --> 00:54:21,103
Man, he didn't know, Petey.

1058
00:54:21,187 --> 00:54:23,355
Blue, he don't want to know.

1059
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:25,565
You pull some crap like that,

1060
00:54:25,650 --> 00:54:26,692
you better be able to back it up.

1061
00:54:26,776 --> 00:54:28,026
Man, let's go, man.

1062
00:54:28,111 --> 00:54:30,862
- Why don't you cool out? Cool out!
- Let's go, Rev.

1063
00:54:31,114 --> 00:54:34,241
- Man, let's go, man.
- What happened?

1064
00:54:34,325 --> 00:54:36,410
This man
acting a fool tonight, man.

1065
00:54:36,494 --> 00:54:37,494
JULIUS: Petey.

1066
00:54:37,578 --> 00:54:38,996
Man, don't even talk
to that man, man.

1067
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:40,998
He acting all crazy and stuff, man.

1068
00:54:41,082 --> 00:54:42,249
It don't even make no sense.

1069
00:54:42,333 --> 00:54:43,333
JULIUS: Petey.

1070
00:54:43,418 --> 00:54:44,918
He know the man's
from out of town.

1071
00:54:46,587 --> 00:54:49,715
Five times.
Five times, player of the week.

1072
00:54:49,799 --> 00:54:52,009
He's not some walk-on scrub, Yoast.

1073
00:54:52,093 --> 00:54:53,802
The boy's a player. He's a star.

1074
00:54:53,886 --> 00:54:56,179
And he busted his butt for you.

1075
00:54:56,347 --> 00:54:57,723
This is all your doing, you blacks.

1076
00:54:57,807 --> 00:54:59,349
That is enough.

1077
00:54:59,934 --> 00:55:01,393
It's my call.

1078
00:55:01,519 --> 00:55:02,894
Now listen.

1079
00:55:03,396 --> 00:55:05,314
You just go on home now, Fred,

1080
00:55:05,398 --> 00:55:08,275
before you do something
that you're going to regret.

1081
00:55:15,408 --> 00:55:16,658
Yeah, well...

1082
00:55:16,743 --> 00:55:19,036
I guess we won't be seeing
much of him, huh?

1083
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:21,830
I will. He's on the
deacon board with me.

1084
00:55:24,334 --> 00:55:26,543
All right, listen, about Petey...

1085
00:55:26,627 --> 00:55:28,003
No thanks required, Coach.

1086
00:55:30,048 --> 00:55:31,256
Thanks?

1087
00:55:32,425 --> 00:55:33,842
You challenged my authority

1088
00:55:33,926 --> 00:55:36,511
in front of the entire
football team, Coach.

1089
00:55:36,596 --> 00:55:38,347
Now, you think you're
doing these boys a favor

1090
00:55:38,431 --> 00:55:41,016
taking them aside every time
I come down on them,

1091
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:43,602
protecting them from big bad Boone.

1092
00:55:44,896 --> 00:55:47,481
You're cutting my legs from under me.

1093
00:55:48,066 --> 00:55:49,566
Some of the boys
just don't respond well

1094
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:50,817
to public criticism.

1095
00:55:50,902 --> 00:55:53,904
I tell them what they need to know,
but I don't humiliate them

1096
00:55:53,988 --> 00:55:55,781
in front of the team.

1097
00:55:56,866 --> 00:55:58,367
Which boys are you talking about?

1098
00:56:00,286 --> 00:56:01,453
Which ones you talking about?

1099
00:56:01,537 --> 00:56:04,790
I come down on Bertier.
I don't see you coddle him.

1100
00:56:05,625 --> 00:56:06,750
Come down on Sunshine.

1101
00:56:06,834 --> 00:56:09,753
Don't see you grab his hand,
take him off to the side.

1102
00:56:09,837 --> 00:56:12,214
Which boys are you talking about?

1103
00:56:14,050 --> 00:56:16,635
Now, I may be a mean cuss,
but I'm the same mean cuss

1104
00:56:16,719 --> 00:56:19,805
with everybody out there
on that football field.

1105
00:56:20,181 --> 00:56:22,557
The world don't give a damn
about how sensitive these kids are,

1106
00:56:22,642 --> 00:56:24,976
especially the young black kids.

1107
00:56:26,354 --> 00:56:29,815
You ain't doing these kids a favor
by patronizing them.

1108
00:56:31,609 --> 00:56:33,485
You're crippling them.

1109
00:56:33,653 --> 00:56:35,946
You're crippling them for life.

1110
00:56:45,164 --> 00:56:46,998
Gerry, what are you doing?

1111
00:56:47,083 --> 00:56:49,126
I'm going down to the Berg.

1112
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:50,710
- The Berg?
- Yep.

1113
00:56:51,587 --> 00:56:53,171
What are you doing at the Berg?

1114
00:56:53,256 --> 00:56:55,340
I'm going to play
basketball with Julius.

1115
00:56:55,425 --> 00:56:56,675
Then we're going to
come back here for dinner.

1116
00:56:56,759 --> 00:56:58,927
Gerry, if your father was still alive...

1117
00:56:59,011 --> 00:57:00,387
Ma, would...

1118
00:57:00,513 --> 00:57:02,848
Just give him a chance.
Just get to know him.

1119
00:57:02,932 --> 00:57:04,307
Listen to him for two seconds.

1120
00:57:04,392 --> 00:57:06,560
I don't want to get to know him.

1121
00:57:08,729 --> 00:57:10,772
You are coming to church
with your mother.

1122
00:57:13,443 --> 00:57:15,193
Right, right, right!

1123
00:57:15,528 --> 00:57:17,070
He's mine! Hut!

1124
00:57:23,703 --> 00:57:24,870
You blew your assignment!

1125
00:57:24,954 --> 00:57:26,913
Man, I'm covering for you.
Don't get in my face.

1126
00:57:26,998 --> 00:57:28,707
Cool out. Cool out.

1127
00:57:29,083 --> 00:57:31,042
Where you at?

1128
00:57:31,127 --> 00:57:32,252
What planet you on tonight?

1129
00:57:32,336 --> 00:57:33,962
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1130
00:57:34,839 --> 00:57:36,965
I mean, it's fine, man.
I knew you was going to stand me up.

1131
00:57:37,049 --> 00:57:39,092
I figured you weren't going to make it
out to the Berg, no way.

1132
00:57:39,177 --> 00:57:41,219
I knew you was all talk,
but now you making us look bad

1133
00:57:41,304 --> 00:57:43,889
- out there on the field.
- Don't talk to me, man.

1134
00:57:43,973 --> 00:57:47,559
- You ain't got nothing to say to me.
- Why the clouds, Sunshine?

1135
00:57:47,643 --> 00:57:49,853
I can't make that pitch, Petey.

1136
00:57:50,062 --> 00:57:53,982
You ain't gonna never play anyway,
unless we're up by 50 points.

1137
00:57:54,066 --> 00:57:55,609
And seeing as how
we ain't never gonna be

1138
00:57:55,693 --> 00:57:58,236
up by no 50 points,
you might as well just sit back, relax,

1139
00:57:58,321 --> 00:57:59,488
and enjoy the bench.

1140
00:58:00,072 --> 00:58:03,742
- How's it going, yo?
- Man, I didn't sign up to play like this.

1141
00:58:03,826 --> 00:58:05,702
These guys we're playing got no heart.

1142
00:58:05,786 --> 00:58:08,747
We play like this against Groveton,
we're going down.

1143
00:58:08,831 --> 00:58:11,291
Okay, Offense.
Offense, let's go.

1144
00:58:13,711 --> 00:58:14,920
Hut!

1145
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:21,092
Touchdown, Titans!

1146
00:58:21,177 --> 00:58:22,802
Game, Titans!

1147
00:58:31,437 --> 00:58:32,979
How you doing, Coach?

1148
00:58:33,064 --> 00:58:34,523
Good morning.

1149
00:58:35,107 --> 00:58:37,150
- Where's your dad?
- He's in his office.

1150
00:58:37,235 --> 00:58:38,693
Nicky, you all right?

1151
00:58:38,778 --> 00:58:40,904
- Yes, Daddy.
- Okay.

1152
00:58:41,364 --> 00:58:42,906
What you doing?

1153
00:58:43,282 --> 00:58:45,033
Shooting some hoops.

1154
00:58:45,743 --> 00:58:47,202
Want to play?

1155
00:58:53,501 --> 00:58:55,293
I just did my nails.

1156
00:58:56,754 --> 00:58:58,630
How you doing? Tyrell.

1157
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:00,674
Coach, if you don't need me,

1158
00:59:00,758 --> 00:59:02,300
I'm going to...

1159
00:59:02,635 --> 00:59:03,885
I'm going to wait out back.

1160
00:59:03,970 --> 00:59:05,554
All right, Herb.

1161
00:59:06,430 --> 00:59:08,765
Coach Boone,
to what do I owe this surprise?

1162
00:59:08,849 --> 00:59:10,225
Have a seat.

1163
00:59:11,477 --> 00:59:12,811
I'll get straight to it.

1164
00:59:12,895 --> 00:59:14,771
We won't survive another game

1165
00:59:14,855 --> 00:59:16,022
like the one we played last Friday,

1166
00:59:16,107 --> 00:59:19,067
so I spoke to Mr. Vernon,
the math teacher,

1167
00:59:19,151 --> 00:59:21,778
asked him to look at
the game film from Groveton,

1168
00:59:21,862 --> 00:59:23,655
who we got next week.

1169
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:26,741
I asked him to analyze it for me.

1170
00:59:26,826 --> 00:59:29,452
Every coach has certain tendencies.

1171
00:59:30,454 --> 00:59:32,539
All of them except Ed Henry.

1172
00:59:33,082 --> 00:59:34,541
The only time we'd be seeing Ed Henry

1173
00:59:34,625 --> 00:59:36,835
is at the State Championship.

1174
00:59:43,342 --> 00:59:45,176
Well, gosh, this is...

1175
00:59:45,803 --> 00:59:47,679
This is great stuff.

1176
00:59:47,805 --> 00:59:49,806
Every quarter broken down,

1177
00:59:50,182 --> 00:59:51,850
how many times
they run each play. I mean...

1178
00:59:51,934 --> 00:59:53,685
You like that, huh?

1179
00:59:55,229 --> 00:59:57,230
We'll be very tough
defensively with this.

1180
00:59:57,315 --> 00:59:58,690
I think so.

1181
01:00:00,026 --> 01:00:01,776
I brought Nicky by.

1182
01:00:01,861 --> 01:00:03,361
She was asking me about Sheryl.

1183
01:00:03,446 --> 01:00:06,906
I'm getting ready to take her over
to some of her friends' house.

1184
01:00:06,991 --> 01:00:08,783
Anytime you want to
bring her by the house,

1185
01:00:08,868 --> 01:00:11,369
we'd be more than happy to have her.

1186
01:00:26,844 --> 01:00:28,345
GIRL 1: He's so cute.

1187
01:00:29,347 --> 01:00:31,598
GIRL 2: He's in my third period class.

1188
01:00:34,101 --> 01:00:36,728
What y'all staring
at old Sunshine for?

1189
01:00:37,063 --> 01:00:38,897
I'm the one dominating on the field.

1190
01:00:38,981 --> 01:00:41,775
- He ain't played a minute all year.
- Who cares about the field?

1191
01:00:41,859 --> 01:00:43,818
Well, I don't want to be
the one to break your heart,

1192
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:45,695
but Sunshine's from California.

1193
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:47,614
Yeah. A California dreamboat.

1194
01:00:47,698 --> 01:00:48,740
No.

1195
01:00:49,075 --> 01:00:51,576
Sunshine is from California.

1196
01:00:51,661 --> 01:00:53,370
He's a Californian...

1197
01:00:53,746 --> 01:00:55,580
You talking to my girl?

1198
01:00:55,665 --> 01:00:57,582
I don't see any livestock around here,

1199
01:00:57,667 --> 01:01:00,001
so I don't know what you talking 'bout.

1200
01:01:03,464 --> 01:01:05,006
It's a fight!
GIRL: Guys, stop it!

1201
01:01:05,091 --> 01:01:06,716
Get off me. Get off me.

1202
01:01:06,801 --> 01:01:07,842
Hey!

1203
01:01:09,261 --> 01:01:10,553
You want some?

1204
01:01:10,805 --> 01:01:12,097
Hey, hey, break it up.

1205
01:01:12,181 --> 01:01:13,181
Break...

1206
01:01:13,265 --> 01:01:15,266
Get your hands off me, man!

1207
01:01:15,601 --> 01:01:17,310
Hey, get off me!

1208
01:01:17,395 --> 01:01:18,645
Come here, man.

1209
01:01:20,356 --> 01:01:22,899
Petey, get these girls out of here.

1210
01:01:22,983 --> 01:01:24,567
Get out of here!

1211
01:01:24,985 --> 01:01:26,444
- Uncle Tom! Traitor!
- Uncle Tom!

1212
01:01:26,529 --> 01:01:28,655
I know you didn't call me
no Uncle Tom.

1213
01:01:28,739 --> 01:01:30,573
Y'all better back off me now, man.

1214
01:01:30,658 --> 01:01:32,200
Go! Move!

1215
01:01:32,284 --> 01:01:35,370
Looks like you went to the zoo
and made some new friends, Bertier.

1216
01:01:35,454 --> 01:01:37,330
BERTIER: Oh, big smart guy, huh?

1217
01:01:49,301 --> 01:01:50,677
Marie has asked about Sheryl.

1218
01:01:50,761 --> 01:01:52,220
Wanted to know if she could
come over and spend the night.

1219
01:01:52,304 --> 01:01:53,972
I told her I'd run it by you,
see what you thought.

1220
01:01:54,056 --> 01:01:55,140
Yeah.

1221
01:01:55,641 --> 01:01:58,351
She's over at the Boones' tonight.
I was going to swing by

1222
01:01:58,436 --> 01:01:59,894
on my way home and pick her up.

1223
01:01:59,979 --> 01:02:01,980
Over at the Boones', huh?

1224
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:03,523
Yeah.

1225
01:02:06,819 --> 01:02:09,070
So that's the way it is, huh?

1226
01:02:09,447 --> 01:02:10,739
Yeah, you haven't changed a bit.

1227
01:02:10,823 --> 01:02:12,490
You was the one trying
to please everybody,

1228
01:02:12,575 --> 01:02:14,159
be the nice guy.

1229
01:02:15,035 --> 01:02:17,871
Sooner or later,
a man's got to pick sides.

1230
01:02:18,497 --> 01:02:21,082
As for me, well, I'm...
I'm not going to put myself

1231
01:02:21,167 --> 01:02:22,500
through the rest of the season
with that uppity...

1232
01:02:22,585 --> 01:02:23,668
Hey!

1233
01:02:23,753 --> 01:02:25,503
I brought you here.

1234
01:02:25,796 --> 01:02:27,505
I want you with me,

1235
01:02:28,424 --> 01:02:30,175
but you got to do what you got to do.

1236
01:02:35,347 --> 01:02:38,183
That's all you can say to me
after all we've been through?

1237
01:02:38,267 --> 01:02:40,059
- "Do what you got to do"?
- Hey, Herb...

1238
01:02:40,144 --> 01:02:41,686
You go to hell.

1239
01:02:52,114 --> 01:02:55,033
That veer's getting better.
I'll admit that.

1240
01:02:55,201 --> 01:02:56,868
But you're still weak on the left side.

1241
01:02:56,952 --> 01:02:58,453
We're not weak on the left side.

1242
01:02:58,537 --> 01:03:00,705
We just got to work harder
on the left side, that's all.

1243
01:03:00,790 --> 01:03:02,540
- That's not the problem.
- What is the problem?

1244
01:03:02,625 --> 01:03:04,584
You think it is, but it ain't.
It's your pass reads.

1245
01:03:04,668 --> 01:03:06,211
It's not... It's a run anyway.

1246
01:03:06,295 --> 01:03:08,046
It's not a pass. The veer is a run.
Not a pass.

1247
01:03:08,130 --> 01:03:09,714
All right, you two, that's enough of that.

1248
01:03:09,799 --> 01:03:12,550
Sheryl, don't you want
to play with Nicky?

1249
01:03:13,928 --> 01:03:15,929
I hate playing with dolls.

1250
01:03:16,222 --> 01:03:18,556
I'm not playing. I'm accessorizing.

1251
01:03:18,641 --> 01:03:20,183
Yeah, why don't you go accessorize?

1252
01:03:20,267 --> 01:03:22,977
Don't you want to go accessorize with...

1253
01:03:24,563 --> 01:03:26,231
Hey, Coach Coon!

1254
01:03:29,109 --> 01:03:31,110
In the back. In the back.

1255
01:03:32,571 --> 01:03:33,738
NICKY: Mommy!

1256
01:03:55,803 --> 01:03:57,428
Where's Coach, man?

1257
01:03:57,513 --> 01:03:58,596
What do he want with us now?

1258
01:03:58,681 --> 01:04:00,098
Coaches ain't called
this meeting tonight.

1259
01:04:00,182 --> 01:04:02,767
- We did.
- We outta here.

1260
01:04:02,852 --> 01:04:04,102
JULIUS: How y'all gonna walk out
on your teammate?

1261
01:04:04,186 --> 01:04:06,354
He say he got something to say.
Y'all got to listen to him.

1262
01:04:06,438 --> 01:04:07,730
Turn around, turn around.

1263
01:04:07,815 --> 01:04:09,107
Where you going? Turn around.

1264
01:04:09,191 --> 01:04:11,526
Coach Boone brought us this far, y'all,

1265
01:04:11,610 --> 01:04:14,153
but he ain't going to be
there for us forever, man.

1266
01:04:14,238 --> 01:04:16,447
So what? We won a few games.

1267
01:04:16,824 --> 01:04:19,534
And y'all fools think that's something?

1268
01:04:19,910 --> 01:04:21,703
Man, that ain't nothing, y'all.

1269
01:04:21,787 --> 01:04:23,246
And you know what else?

1270
01:04:23,330 --> 01:04:25,123
We ain't nothing, either.

1271
01:04:25,207 --> 01:04:27,750
Yeah, we came together in camp. Cool.

1272
01:04:28,627 --> 01:04:31,170
But then we're right back here,
and the world tells us

1273
01:04:31,255 --> 01:04:33,172
that they don't want us to be together.

1274
01:04:33,257 --> 01:04:36,718
We fall apart like we ain't a damn bit
of nothing, man.

1275
01:04:37,136 --> 01:04:39,429
And y'all think
we done won something?

1276
01:04:39,513 --> 01:04:41,931
Man, we ain't won nothing, y'all...

1277
01:04:42,224 --> 01:04:43,474
Nothing.

1278
01:04:43,934 --> 01:04:46,144
Rev, what's that you're always
telling me when I get sick

1279
01:04:46,228 --> 01:04:49,105
of trying to keep up
with my grades and stuff?

1280
01:04:49,189 --> 01:04:51,316
Even youths

1281
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:54,235
Grow tired and weary

1282
01:04:54,653 --> 01:04:57,155
Even young men stumble and fall

1283
01:04:57,323 --> 01:04:59,616
But those who trust in the Lord

1284
01:04:59,783 --> 01:05:02,368
Will renew their strength

1285
01:05:02,995 --> 01:05:04,287
Say amen.

1286
01:05:04,371 --> 01:05:06,205
Amen. That's what I'm talking about.

1287
01:05:06,290 --> 01:05:08,166
Amen... amen, right?

1288
01:05:08,459 --> 01:05:09,834
That's right, Rev.

1289
01:05:09,919 --> 01:05:12,837
They will soar on wings like eagles

1290
01:05:12,922 --> 01:05:14,797
Oh, Iike eagles, y'all

1291
01:05:14,882 --> 01:05:16,966
Like eagles, y'all

1292
01:05:17,051 --> 01:05:18,343
They will walk

1293
01:05:18,427 --> 01:05:20,178
And not grow faint

1294
01:05:20,930 --> 01:05:22,847
Yeah. Can I get an amen?

1295
01:05:24,183 --> 01:05:25,266
Yeah!

1296
01:05:26,602 --> 01:05:29,270
Yeah.

1297
01:05:30,689 --> 01:05:33,858
We're playing Groveton
Friday night, y'all.

1298
01:05:34,693 --> 01:05:36,986
You all gonna play like
you ain't got no heart?

1299
01:05:37,071 --> 01:05:38,071
No!

1300
01:05:38,238 --> 01:05:43,201
- Do you all want a victory?
- Yeah!

1301
01:05:43,285 --> 01:05:44,535
Turn in!

1302
01:05:48,832 --> 01:05:49,999
Yeah!

1303
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:54,712
Like I said,
we will not be intimidated.

1304
01:05:54,797 --> 01:05:56,381
We're going to play football games.

1305
01:05:56,465 --> 01:05:58,925
Hatred, violence will not intimidate us.

1306
01:05:59,510 --> 01:06:00,802
Is that why you need
the state troopers, Coach?

1307
01:06:00,886 --> 01:06:03,471
Look, I don't need no
John Brown state troopers.

1308
01:06:03,555 --> 01:06:05,723
And you can tell whoever
threw this brick through my window

1309
01:06:05,808 --> 01:06:08,601
they can come visit me anytime.
I'll be at home.

1310
01:06:08,686 --> 01:06:09,894
I think it's time you stopped

1311
01:06:09,979 --> 01:06:11,938
antagonizing everybody and
learned a little humility.

1312
01:06:12,022 --> 01:06:13,064
Humility, huh?

1313
01:06:13,148 --> 01:06:15,358
You know, if you could
just keep your mouth shut

1314
01:06:15,442 --> 01:06:17,235
and if you didn't brag so much...

1315
01:06:17,319 --> 01:06:18,778
I see. So you're blaming me

1316
01:06:18,862 --> 01:06:20,071
for what happened last night?

1317
01:06:20,155 --> 01:06:22,490
No. I am talking about
setting a good example

1318
01:06:22,574 --> 01:06:24,575
for our boys and for the community.

1319
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:26,577
I don't scratch my head unless it itches,

1320
01:06:26,662 --> 01:06:28,246
and I don't dance unless
I hear some music.

1321
01:06:28,330 --> 01:06:30,581
I will not be intimidated.
That's just the way it is.

1322
01:06:30,666 --> 01:06:32,458
If you want to carry
your sinful pride with you

1323
01:06:32,543 --> 01:06:34,002
to your grave, that's your business.

1324
01:06:34,086 --> 01:06:35,878
But when your sins
endanger my little girl,

1325
01:06:35,963 --> 01:06:37,547
it becomes mine.

1326
01:06:37,923 --> 01:06:39,173
My sins?

1327
01:06:39,842 --> 01:06:43,386
You think my sins had something to do
with what happened last night?

1328
01:06:43,470 --> 01:06:44,887
I'm sorry about what
happened to your daughter,

1329
01:06:44,972 --> 01:06:46,347
I really am,

1330
01:06:46,432 --> 01:06:47,724
but maybe you got a small taste

1331
01:06:47,808 --> 01:06:49,767
of what my girls go through.

1332
01:06:51,437 --> 01:06:53,563
Welcome to my life, Yoast.

1333
01:07:02,364 --> 01:07:03,781
What's going on?

1334
01:07:03,866 --> 01:07:05,033
Coach.

1335
01:07:08,162 --> 01:07:10,496
We wanted to let you know
we was going to warm up a little

1336
01:07:10,581 --> 01:07:12,123
different tonight.

1337
01:07:12,207 --> 01:07:14,459
This is the first
true test of the season

1338
01:07:14,543 --> 01:07:16,627
for the undefeated
T.C. Williams Titans,

1339
01:07:16,712 --> 01:07:18,629
'cause tonight,
they're going up against

1340
01:07:18,714 --> 01:07:20,840
the undefeated Groveton Lions.

1341
01:07:21,967 --> 01:07:24,135
Their all-state noseguard, Kip Tyler,

1342
01:07:24,219 --> 01:07:26,888
is as mean as a copperhead snake.

1343
01:07:28,057 --> 01:07:30,099
And here come the Titans.

1344
01:07:31,226 --> 01:07:33,811
They're playing in front
of a capacity crowd

1345
01:07:33,896 --> 01:07:36,189
for the first time this season.

1346
01:07:37,441 --> 01:07:38,649
Hoo, ha, we feel

1347
01:07:38,734 --> 01:07:40,318
Hoo, ha, real good

1348
01:07:40,402 --> 01:07:42,278
Hoo, ha, we feel

1349
01:07:42,362 --> 01:07:43,988
Hoo, ha, real good

1350
01:07:44,073 --> 01:07:45,990
Hoo, ha, we feel

1351
01:07:46,075 --> 01:07:47,617
Hoo, ha, real good

1352
01:07:47,701 --> 01:07:49,619
Hoo, ha, we feel

1353
01:07:49,703 --> 01:07:51,329
Hoo, ha, real good

1354
01:07:51,413 --> 01:07:53,289
Hoo, ha, we feel

1355
01:07:54,208 --> 01:07:56,542
Julius Campbell
is playing strong-side linebacker.

1356
01:07:56,627 --> 01:07:58,294
- Sheryl.
- He's so good. He's got All-American...

1357
01:07:58,378 --> 01:07:59,545
Sheryl.

1358
01:07:59,922 --> 01:08:02,131
- And Gerry Bertier...
- Sheryl.

1359
01:08:02,758 --> 01:08:05,551
I do not care.

1360
01:08:06,053 --> 01:08:07,470
Five, six!

1361
01:08:08,013 --> 01:08:10,014
Five, six, seven, eight!

1362
01:08:10,099 --> 01:08:14,018
Everywhere we go

1363
01:08:14,103 --> 01:08:17,939
People wanna know

1364
01:08:18,023 --> 01:08:21,776
Who we are

1365
01:08:21,860 --> 01:08:26,114
So we tell them

1366
01:08:26,198 --> 01:08:29,992
We are the Titans

1367
01:08:30,077 --> 01:08:34,247
The mighty, mighty Titans

1368
01:08:38,168 --> 01:08:40,878
Who do they think they are,
the Beatles?

1369
01:08:42,047 --> 01:08:44,590
All right, quit gawking. Warm up.

1370
01:08:45,050 --> 01:08:46,551
- Tyler.
- Coach?

1371
01:08:47,219 --> 01:08:48,928
Shut 'em up. Hard.

1372
01:08:53,851 --> 01:08:55,143
Ready!

1373
01:08:56,395 --> 01:08:58,146
Omaha, Budds, Omaha.

1374
01:08:58,564 --> 01:09:00,565
- Set!
- Omaha!

1375
01:09:01,733 --> 01:09:02,942
Hike!

1376
01:09:07,239 --> 01:09:08,990
Song's over, Sambo.

1377
01:09:18,417 --> 01:09:20,918
Let's go, baby. Let's go, let's go.

1378
01:09:23,255 --> 01:09:25,381
- What happened, Lastik?
- I audibled.

1379
01:09:25,465 --> 01:09:27,133
Rev, I swear to God I audibled.

1380
01:09:27,217 --> 01:09:29,218
- I didn't hear it.
- All right, fellas, coming through.

1381
01:09:29,303 --> 01:09:30,386
Swear to God.

1382
01:09:30,470 --> 01:09:31,971
Let's take a look at that, son.

1383
01:09:33,932 --> 01:09:35,224
Well, he broke a bone in the wrist.

1384
01:09:35,309 --> 01:09:36,559
He won't be throwing
anymore this season.

1385
01:09:38,228 --> 01:09:39,604
You got one minute, Coach.

1386
01:09:39,688 --> 01:09:42,231
Take the other time-out, Coach.

1387
01:09:43,901 --> 01:09:45,318
- Ronnie Bass!
- Coach.

1388
01:09:45,402 --> 01:09:46,944
Rev's going back in, right?

1389
01:09:47,029 --> 01:09:48,487
Not at quarterback, son.

1390
01:09:48,572 --> 01:09:51,532
- I can't make that pitch, Coach.
- Yes, you can.

1391
01:09:52,117 --> 01:09:53,618
When I was 15 years old,

1392
01:09:53,702 --> 01:09:55,077
I lost my mother and my father

1393
01:09:55,162 --> 01:09:57,705
in the same month, Ronnie.
The same month.

1394
01:09:57,789 --> 01:09:59,790
12 brothers and sisters.
I was the youngest one,

1395
01:09:59,875 --> 01:10:01,500
but they were all looking up to me.

1396
01:10:01,585 --> 01:10:03,669
Now, I wasn't ready yet,
either, but they needed me.

1397
01:10:03,754 --> 01:10:05,963
Your team needs you tonight.

1398
01:10:06,048 --> 01:10:07,840
You're the colonel. You're going to
command your troops tonight.

1399
01:10:07,925 --> 01:10:08,966
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

1400
01:10:09,051 --> 01:10:11,469
Twins right, 48, zero read.

1401
01:10:11,553 --> 01:10:17,475
Let's go.

1402
01:10:17,643 --> 01:10:19,685
What's the matter? Haven't you ever
seen a football injury before,

1403
01:10:19,770 --> 01:10:22,021
you wimps?
Let's go. Show some life in those legs.

1404
01:10:22,105 --> 01:10:24,148
I got it. It's going
to be all right.

1405
01:10:24,233 --> 01:10:25,816
Budds, you release this time.

1406
01:10:25,901 --> 01:10:28,152
- Louie, let him through, all right?
- What?

1407
01:10:28,237 --> 01:10:30,655
Just let him through.
Trust me.

1408
01:10:30,739 --> 01:10:32,698
You had 12 brothers and sisters?

1409
01:10:32,783 --> 01:10:35,243
- Eight.
- Yeah. Twelve sounds better.

1410
01:10:39,581 --> 01:10:40,748
Ready!

1411
01:10:42,167 --> 01:10:43,334
Set!

1412
01:10:43,418 --> 01:10:45,753
Blue, 21!

1413
01:10:45,837 --> 01:10:47,004
Hut!

1414
01:10:59,518 --> 01:11:00,893
Ref! Unnecessary roughness!

1415
01:11:00,978 --> 01:11:02,103
That's a penalty!

1416
01:11:02,187 --> 01:11:05,189
On the quarterback?
Are you kidding me, Coach?

1417
01:11:10,362 --> 01:11:12,029
Did you see that, man?

1418
01:11:12,114 --> 01:11:13,864
That's a bad white boy, man.

1419
01:11:13,949 --> 01:11:15,032
Hike!

1420
01:11:21,123 --> 01:11:22,873
We've got ourselves
a football player.

1421
01:11:22,958 --> 01:11:30,423
Hut!

1422
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:51,736
All right, listen up,
listen up, listen up.

1423
01:11:52,195 --> 01:11:54,572
Listen up, listen up.
Listen up.

1424
01:11:56,575 --> 01:11:57,992
Game ball.

1425
01:11:59,661 --> 01:12:01,287
Ronnie Bass.

1426
01:12:04,333 --> 01:12:06,375
Hey, this ball right here...
Hey, this ball right here

1427
01:12:06,460 --> 01:12:08,085
goes to the real king
right here.

1428
01:12:08,170 --> 01:12:10,921
- Thanks for teaching me the veer, Rev.
- Aw, come on.

1429
01:12:11,006 --> 01:12:12,131
Rev!

1430
01:12:12,215 --> 01:12:16,594
Rev! Rev! Rev!

1431
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:19,305
Come on.

1432
01:12:19,389 --> 01:12:20,556
Coach?

1433
01:12:21,266 --> 01:12:23,642
Can I speak with you in private?

1434
01:12:24,019 --> 01:12:25,102
Sure.

1435
01:12:27,522 --> 01:12:29,565
What's on your mind, son?

1436
01:12:30,692 --> 01:12:32,985
I want Ray off the team, Coach.

1437
01:12:34,529 --> 01:12:37,156
- You know my policy, Gerry.
- Yes, I do,

1438
01:12:37,741 --> 01:12:38,824
and I respect it,

1439
01:12:38,909 --> 01:12:41,827
but I know that Ray missed
that block on purpose.

1440
01:12:43,330 --> 01:12:46,123
Sometimes you just got
to cut a man loose.

1441
01:12:49,086 --> 01:12:51,045
Well, you're the captain.

1442
01:12:52,005 --> 01:12:55,299
You make a decision,
but you support your decision.

1443
01:12:56,218 --> 01:12:59,136
We're going to
remember this for a long time.

1444
01:12:59,388 --> 01:13:02,306
Hey, guys, wait up.
I want to catch a ride with you.

1445
01:13:02,933 --> 01:13:04,016
Ray?

1446
01:13:05,769 --> 01:13:07,478
Oh, man, not a word.

1447
01:13:08,146 --> 01:13:09,480
You're out.

1448
01:13:09,648 --> 01:13:10,731
What?

1449
01:13:11,316 --> 01:13:13,275
I'm not going to let you
play for this team anymore.

1450
01:13:16,196 --> 01:13:18,072
Oh, yeah, Jerry Lewis?

1451
01:13:19,032 --> 01:13:23,035
Going to go and tell Coach Coon
what to do, just like last time?

1452
01:13:23,412 --> 01:13:25,204
But, then, that's right.

1453
01:13:25,288 --> 01:13:27,581
He is your daddy now, isn't he?

1454
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:30,251
Boone don't cut anybody.

1455
01:13:30,335 --> 01:13:31,919
Remember, Gerry?

1456
01:13:32,963 --> 01:13:34,505
I had you cut, Ray.

1457
01:13:35,841 --> 01:13:39,468
You're willing to just throw away
our friendship for them?

1458
01:13:42,347 --> 01:13:44,014
You can keep them.

1459
01:13:57,487 --> 01:13:58,612
Hi.

1460
01:14:13,211 --> 01:14:14,503
Officer?

1461
01:14:17,090 --> 01:14:19,884
Heck of a game you boys
played last night.

1462
01:14:20,552 --> 01:14:21,760
Thanks.

1463
01:14:21,845 --> 01:14:23,554
Thank you, Officer.

1464
01:14:23,722 --> 01:14:26,056
Best defense I've seen
in 20 years.

1465
01:14:27,767 --> 01:14:30,895
Tell that coach of yours
to keep up the good work.

1466
01:14:30,979 --> 01:14:33,063
Oh, yeah. I'll do that.

1467
01:14:42,532 --> 01:14:43,908
BERTIER: Yo, man,
your taxi had a siren.

1468
01:14:43,992 --> 01:14:45,409
Superman!

1469
01:14:45,494 --> 01:14:47,244
Hey, man, what's going on?

1470
01:14:47,329 --> 01:14:49,121
Doing all right.

1471
01:15:15,482 --> 01:15:17,441
This song
goes out to the undefeated Titans.

1472
01:15:17,526 --> 01:15:20,611
This city is alive with school spirit.
Go get 'em, Titans!

1473
01:16:19,754 --> 01:16:21,255
We are here tonight to honor men

1474
01:16:21,339 --> 01:16:23,340
that are teaching our young people

1475
01:16:23,425 --> 01:16:25,634
leadership on and off the field

1476
01:16:26,011 --> 01:16:28,137
and high moral standards as well.

1477
01:16:28,221 --> 01:16:29,263
Ladies and gentlemen,

1478
01:16:29,347 --> 01:16:33,100
let me introduce to you
the 1971 Hall of Fame nominees.

1479
01:16:35,562 --> 01:16:37,146
Come on, Daddy.

1480
01:16:41,484 --> 01:16:42,568
When we played Jefferson,

1481
01:16:42,652 --> 01:16:45,029
we were down by four
with 10 seconds left.

1482
01:16:45,113 --> 01:16:46,905
So we blitzed the safety
from the weak side...

1483
01:16:46,990 --> 01:16:48,032
Wow.

1484
01:16:48,658 --> 01:16:51,660
Heck of a season
the Titans are having, Coach.

1485
01:16:52,162 --> 01:16:53,871
Too bad it's got to end.

1486
01:16:53,955 --> 01:16:56,081
Oh, we're still in it, Lyle.

1487
01:16:56,416 --> 01:16:58,167
Taber's boys are pretty good,

1488
01:16:58,251 --> 01:17:00,210
but I think we'll take 'em in the regional.

1489
01:17:00,295 --> 01:17:03,255
Well, not if we have anything
to say about it.

1490
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:05,674
You just leave this to us, Bill.

1491
01:17:05,759 --> 01:17:08,844
Boone's out, and you're
head coach again.

1492
01:17:09,971 --> 01:17:12,723
And all roads lead to the Hall of Fame.

1493
01:17:13,183 --> 01:17:14,308
Coach Taber?

1494
01:17:14,392 --> 01:17:15,809
What do you think
of the Titans, Coach?

1495
01:17:15,894 --> 01:17:17,227
Think you have a chance
against that defense

1496
01:17:17,312 --> 01:17:19,563
they have over there at T.C.?

1497
01:17:19,689 --> 01:17:22,107
Ton, Billy, Ray,
come on over here.

1498
01:17:22,192 --> 01:17:24,902
Boys. These are
my All-American tackles.

1499
01:17:25,612 --> 01:17:27,071
Prize bulls who don't do nothing

1500
01:17:27,155 --> 01:17:29,239
but knock the chocolate out of folks.

1501
01:17:29,324 --> 01:17:32,534
Is it true you're not gonna
trade films with Coach Boone?

1502
01:17:32,661 --> 01:17:35,663
I'm not gonna do anything
to help that monkey.

1503
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:39,958
Well,

1504
01:17:40,919 --> 01:17:43,087
what are we going to do about this?

1505
01:17:44,172 --> 01:17:46,840
We're gonna get ready for Saturday.
See you out there on the field.

1506
01:17:49,469 --> 01:17:50,552
Hut!

1507
01:17:56,976 --> 01:17:58,894
Hey, Mr. Official.

1508
01:17:59,396 --> 01:18:00,604
Mr. Official, can I talk
to you for a second?

1509
01:18:00,689 --> 01:18:04,274
Back off, Coach,
if you want to stay in this game.

1510
01:18:04,609 --> 01:18:05,651
Hut!

1511
01:18:09,531 --> 01:18:11,782
I've got holding on 78 white.

1512
01:18:11,866 --> 01:18:14,952
Are you trying to cheat
my boys out of the game?

1513
01:18:15,036 --> 01:18:16,704
15 more yards.

1514
01:18:16,788 --> 01:18:18,080
Let 'em play, Ref, let 'em play.

1515
01:18:18,164 --> 01:18:20,457
Let 'em play! Let the boys play!

1516
01:18:21,251 --> 01:18:22,501
- Cheater!
- Coach, come on.

1517
01:18:22,585 --> 01:18:24,253
Cheater!
HINDS: Coach.

1518
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:33,345
Go, go, go, go!

1519
01:18:37,892 --> 01:18:40,477
Oh, come on! What was that?

1520
01:18:42,230 --> 01:18:45,733
What are you, blind?
That wasn't a hold.

1521
01:18:45,817 --> 01:18:48,444
Oh, come on, that was such a bad call.

1522
01:18:51,990 --> 01:18:53,157
Titus!

1523
01:18:57,787 --> 01:18:59,705
Give him a piece of your mind!

1524
01:19:04,252 --> 01:19:05,753
I know all about it, Titus.

1525
01:19:05,837 --> 01:19:07,129
What are you talking about, Bill?

1526
01:19:07,213 --> 01:19:09,173
You call this game fair,

1527
01:19:09,466 --> 01:19:11,341
or I'll go to the papers.

1528
01:19:11,426 --> 01:19:13,802
I don't care if I go down with you,

1529
01:19:13,887 --> 01:19:18,974
but before God, I swear I'll see
every last one of you thrown in jail.

1530
01:19:19,184 --> 01:19:21,810
- You dig your own grave.
- Okay.

1531
01:19:22,812 --> 01:19:24,354
Defense! On me!

1532
01:19:25,482 --> 01:19:27,816
Okay, Petey, don't you drift
to the strong side.

1533
01:19:27,901 --> 01:19:29,568
Coach, they're calling a holding
penalty on me every time.

1534
01:19:29,652 --> 01:19:31,528
Did I ask for your excuses?

1535
01:19:31,613 --> 01:19:34,156
You want to act like a star,
you better give me a star effort,

1536
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:35,741
do you hear me?

1537
01:19:38,203 --> 01:19:39,661
Forget about him!

1538
01:19:39,746 --> 01:19:42,039
Alan, you're in!

1539
01:19:42,123 --> 01:19:44,249
Come on! All right.

1540
01:19:44,334 --> 01:19:48,045
Now, I don't want them to gain
another yard.

1541
01:19:48,546 --> 01:19:51,131
You blitz all night!

1542
01:19:51,216 --> 01:19:52,800
If they cross the line of scrimmage,

1543
01:19:52,884 --> 01:19:54,760
I'm gonna take
every last one of you out.

1544
01:19:54,844 --> 01:19:56,428
You make sure

1545
01:19:56,805 --> 01:19:59,681
they remember forever

1546
01:20:00,391 --> 01:20:02,726
the night they played the Titans.

1547
01:20:04,938 --> 01:20:06,230
Leave no doubt!

1548
01:20:08,399 --> 01:20:11,401
Set! Come on, y'all! Swing it left!

1549
01:20:11,528 --> 01:20:13,570
All right! All right! All right!

1550
01:20:13,655 --> 01:20:15,072
Set! Hut!

1551
01:20:24,499 --> 01:20:26,500
You better make yourself
comfortable down there.

1552
01:20:26,584 --> 01:20:28,210
Real comfortable.

1553
01:20:56,447 --> 01:20:57,865
You did good!

1554
01:20:57,949 --> 01:21:00,951
- That one was for you, Coach.
- All right, baby. All right.

1555
01:21:01,035 --> 01:21:03,245
You brought us here, Coach.

1556
01:21:03,329 --> 01:21:06,456
Run it up, Herman!
Leave no doubt!

1557
01:21:10,336 --> 01:21:11,628
Set! Hut!

1558
01:21:19,512 --> 01:21:20,596
Hut hut!

1559
01:21:33,818 --> 01:21:35,152
Good game.

1560
01:21:35,695 --> 01:21:36,820
Yeah.

1561
01:21:38,323 --> 01:21:39,448
Good game.

1562
01:21:39,532 --> 01:21:41,158
Coach. Coach.

1563
01:21:42,827 --> 01:21:44,661
I took a straw poll.

1564
01:21:45,663 --> 01:21:48,373
You just lost yourself the Hall of Fame.

1565
01:21:55,173 --> 01:21:56,798
BERTIER: Good game, y'all.

1566
01:21:57,884 --> 01:21:59,676
Hey, good job, 43.

1567
01:21:59,802 --> 01:22:01,053
Good job. Good job, men.

1568
01:22:01,137 --> 01:22:02,304
Hey, way to stick.

1569
01:22:02,388 --> 01:22:03,639
Good job.

1570
01:22:03,932 --> 01:22:05,599
Good game, Coach.

1571
01:22:09,062 --> 01:22:10,228
Coach.

1572
01:22:19,989 --> 01:22:21,156
Yeah!

1573
01:22:31,292 --> 01:22:32,501
Titans!

1574
01:22:32,961 --> 01:22:34,169
Yeah!

1575
01:22:35,713 --> 01:22:39,716
Petey! What happened out there, man?
Come on, talk to me, Petey.

1576
01:22:40,885 --> 01:22:43,053
- Petey!
- I'm so proud of you.

1577
01:22:43,805 --> 01:22:46,056
Hey, Julius. Julius.

1578
01:22:47,266 --> 01:22:48,266
Come here, man.

1579
01:22:48,351 --> 01:22:50,394
- Don't move.
- Go on. It's okay.

1580
01:22:50,478 --> 01:22:51,645
- Man.
- What's up, man?

1581
01:22:51,729 --> 01:22:52,980
Let's get out of here.

1582
01:22:53,064 --> 01:22:54,398
Let's go paint the town or something.

1583
01:22:54,482 --> 01:22:55,732
Let's go. Let's go.

1584
01:22:55,817 --> 01:22:57,192
I got to hang with my girl tonight.

1585
01:22:57,276 --> 01:22:59,069
- I got to hang with her tonight.
- All right, all right.

1586
01:22:59,153 --> 01:23:00,737
Where you going?

1587
01:23:01,322 --> 01:23:02,781
I don't know.

1588
01:23:03,074 --> 01:23:05,242
I don't know, but I'm gonna go.
All right?

1589
01:23:05,326 --> 01:23:06,952
- You gonna go?
- Yeah, man.

1590
01:23:07,036 --> 01:23:08,537
I want to go, man, but you
know what I mean, man.

1591
01:23:08,621 --> 01:23:10,372
I know. I'll see ya.

1592
01:23:23,302 --> 01:23:26,763
Looks like you weren't the one
with the mixed-up priorities, huh?

1593
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:28,056
Emma...

1594
01:23:28,766 --> 01:23:32,602
I think it's gonna take me a little longer
than you might like.

1595
01:23:32,812 --> 01:23:34,146
But, um...

1596
01:23:36,065 --> 01:23:38,984
I just wanted you to know
that I'm gonna try.

1597
01:23:42,947 --> 01:23:44,573
Goodbye, Gerry.

1598
01:23:47,285 --> 01:23:48,410
Emma?

1599
01:23:49,287 --> 01:23:50,954
Make me a promise?

1600
01:23:51,748 --> 01:23:55,792
You'll be there to root for us
when we play Marshall for the title?

1601
01:24:04,010 --> 01:24:05,719
I know how much it meant to you.

1602
01:24:08,306 --> 01:24:10,140
I ain't gonna lie.

1603
01:24:11,517 --> 01:24:14,019
I wanted the Hall of Fame real bad.

1604
01:24:14,395 --> 01:24:16,354
Just plain old jealousy.

1605
01:24:17,190 --> 01:24:18,899
As old as Cain and Abel.

1606
01:24:18,983 --> 01:24:20,484
You know what?

1607
01:24:20,610 --> 01:24:22,235
I wanted it, too.

1608
01:24:23,071 --> 01:24:27,199
But there's always next year
or the year after that.

1609
01:24:27,283 --> 01:24:29,534
As long as it takes for them to wise up.

1610
01:24:29,619 --> 01:24:31,745
Wouldn't want it now anyway.

1611
01:24:31,913 --> 01:24:33,789
Bunch of old rednecks.

1612
01:24:40,004 --> 01:24:42,589
Let's knock 'em dead at state, Coach.

1613
01:24:42,799 --> 01:24:45,425
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

1614
01:24:45,510 --> 01:24:47,928
Daddy! You're home!

1615
01:24:48,513 --> 01:24:50,055
My girls!

1616
01:24:50,139 --> 01:24:51,890
Give me a kiss.

1617
01:24:53,017 --> 01:24:54,810
- Congratulations, Herman.
- All right.

1618
01:24:54,894 --> 01:24:56,770
What'd I tell you, baby, huh?

1619
01:24:56,854 --> 01:24:59,481
Yeah, we can't get too
far ahead of ourselves.

1620
01:24:59,565 --> 01:25:03,151
We still got to get
Ed Henry and Marshall.

1621
01:25:03,236 --> 01:25:04,528
We got all these...

1622
01:25:04,612 --> 01:25:07,906
You've done a good job,
Coach Boone! Congratulations!

1623
01:25:16,374 --> 01:25:18,458
Well, I'll be John Brown.

1624
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:22,963
We cleaned up the kitchen, Daddy,
so you could get right to work.

1625
01:25:23,631 --> 01:25:24,881
You did?

1626
01:25:24,966 --> 01:25:27,050
Well, I got news for you.

1627
01:25:27,552 --> 01:25:28,927
I ain't workin' tonight.

1628
01:25:29,011 --> 01:25:30,887
Tonight, we're gonna celebrate.
We're gonna let these people know

1629
01:25:30,972 --> 01:25:32,764
- who's gonna win State. Right?
- Right!

1630
01:25:32,849 --> 01:25:35,100
- Right?
- Right!

1631
01:25:36,394 --> 01:25:39,604
Everybody!
NICKY: We're gonna win State!

1632
01:25:40,398 --> 01:25:46,570
We're gonna win State!

1633
01:26:05,923 --> 01:26:09,259
- Hey, Gerry! You, man!
- No, you! No, you, you!

1634
01:26:09,343 --> 01:26:10,677
You! Yeah!

1635
01:26:19,645 --> 01:26:22,189
Oh, shoot! Gerry! Are you okay?

1636
01:26:45,213 --> 01:26:46,796
How you doin', son?

1637
01:26:46,881 --> 01:26:48,298
He ain't all right? He all right?

1638
01:26:48,382 --> 01:26:49,466
He's, uh...

1639
01:26:49,550 --> 01:26:51,092
How's he doing?

1640
01:26:53,512 --> 01:26:55,639
Not too good. Not too good.

1641
01:26:56,474 --> 01:26:58,058
How well is he doing?

1642
01:26:58,142 --> 01:27:01,811
How bad is it?

1643
01:27:01,896 --> 01:27:04,397
He's paralyzed from the waist down.

1644
01:27:04,649 --> 01:27:07,692
Don't say that to me.
Don't say that to me.

1645
01:27:12,865 --> 01:27:14,658
Sorry, Mrs. Bertier.

1646
01:27:15,743 --> 01:27:17,953
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1647
01:27:20,414 --> 01:27:23,458
He doesn't want to see
anybody but you, Julius.

1648
01:27:23,542 --> 01:27:24,542
Yes, ma'am.

1649
01:27:24,627 --> 01:27:28,004
- You be strong.
- Yes, ma'am.

1650
01:27:28,089 --> 01:27:31,216
Those tears are not gonna
make my boy walk again.

1651
01:27:42,561 --> 01:27:44,229
Only kin's allowed in here.

1652
01:27:44,313 --> 01:27:46,690
Alice, are you blind?

1653
01:27:47,858 --> 01:27:50,485
Don't you see the family resemblance?

1654
01:27:51,904 --> 01:27:53,571
That's my brother.

1655
01:27:55,992 --> 01:27:57,325
All right.

1656
01:28:10,506 --> 01:28:11,756
Oh, man.

1657
01:28:13,342 --> 01:28:16,553
Well, you think I look banged up,
you should see my Camaro.

1658
01:28:16,637 --> 01:28:17,595
Man,

1659
01:28:19,098 --> 01:28:20,932
I sure am sorry, man.

1660
01:28:21,559 --> 01:28:24,019
I should have been there with you.

1661
01:28:24,228 --> 01:28:26,313
What are you talking about?

1662
01:28:27,565 --> 01:28:30,608
You would've been in the bed
right next to me.

1663
01:28:30,860 --> 01:28:32,986
You can't be hurt like this.

1664
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:38,116
You're Superman.

1665
01:28:44,957 --> 01:28:47,083
I was afraid of you, Julius.

1666
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:52,255
I only saw what I was afraid of.

1667
01:28:54,133 --> 01:28:57,052
And now I know
I was only hating my brother.

1668
01:28:59,347 --> 01:29:01,431
I'll tell you what, though.

1669
01:29:02,808 --> 01:29:04,934
When all this is over,

1670
01:29:05,853 --> 01:29:09,147
me and you are gonna move out
to the same neighborhood together.

1671
01:29:09,231 --> 01:29:10,815
Okay? And,

1672
01:29:11,984 --> 01:29:14,694
and we'll get old, and we'll get fat.

1673
01:29:15,905 --> 01:29:18,698
And there ain't gonna be
all this black-white between us.

1674
01:29:26,165 --> 01:29:27,457
Left side.

1675
01:29:29,085 --> 01:29:30,460
Strong side.

1676
01:29:38,594 --> 01:29:40,637
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1677
01:29:42,890 --> 01:29:44,599
The Marshall film.

1678
01:29:45,184 --> 01:29:46,559
Well, that's good.

1679
01:29:46,644 --> 01:29:50,647
We're gonna have to be real sharp
on the offensive and defensive sides

1680
01:29:50,731 --> 01:29:52,315
of the football.

1681
01:29:52,900 --> 01:29:55,068
Figure we give the kids
a couple of extra practices this week,

1682
01:29:55,152 --> 01:29:57,278
make sure they stay focused.

1683
01:29:58,489 --> 01:30:00,198
Got a press conference
today at 12 noon.

1684
01:30:00,282 --> 01:30:01,908
Press conference?

1685
01:30:02,535 --> 01:30:05,745
Listen, what we do here
amongst ourselves is one thing,

1686
01:30:05,830 --> 01:30:08,832
but we are not gonna parade around
talking about football at a time like this.

1687
01:30:08,916 --> 01:30:11,084
Hold on. I'm not talking about parading.

1688
01:30:11,168 --> 01:30:12,502
I'm talking about going out there,

1689
01:30:12,586 --> 01:30:14,921
presenting a strong, united front.

1690
01:30:15,005 --> 01:30:16,714
Now, I'm hurting

1691
01:30:17,675 --> 01:30:21,219
just like you are, Yoast,
but the season is not over yet.

1692
01:30:22,346 --> 01:30:24,639
I did... We did not come this far

1693
01:30:24,849 --> 01:30:27,183
to just break down
and lose now.

1694
01:30:27,268 --> 01:30:30,395
Everything's not always
about winning and losing.

1695
01:30:31,230 --> 01:30:32,689
I'm a winner.

1696
01:30:34,108 --> 01:30:35,733
I'm going to win.

1697
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:38,862
Is this even about football anymore?

1698
01:30:39,572 --> 01:30:41,531
Or is it just about you?

1699
01:30:42,783 --> 01:30:44,284
Coach Boone.

1700
01:30:44,577 --> 01:30:46,786
Coach, you lost Bertier.

1701
01:30:47,204 --> 01:30:48,872
Is your defense in trouble?

1702
01:30:48,956 --> 01:30:51,499
You cannot replace a Gerry Bertier.

1703
01:30:53,544 --> 01:30:55,670
As a player or person.

1704
01:31:01,302 --> 01:31:03,011
I don't know, Mama.

1705
01:31:07,850 --> 01:31:10,894
Maybe Yoast was right.
Maybe I pushed 'em too hard.

1706
01:31:10,978 --> 01:31:12,854
Gerry had an accident.

1707
01:31:14,940 --> 01:31:16,983
Sometimes life's just hard.

1708
01:31:17,985 --> 01:31:19,777
For no reason at all.

1709
01:31:19,904 --> 01:31:22,739
You think I was blinded
by my own ambition?

1710
01:31:25,409 --> 01:31:29,078
Whatever kind of ambition it took
to do what you did around here,

1711
01:31:30,831 --> 01:31:33,833
this world could use
a lot more of it, Herman.

1712
01:31:45,095 --> 01:31:46,429
BERTIER: Hey, Coach.

1713
01:31:46,514 --> 01:31:47,889
Hey, Coach.

1714
01:31:55,105 --> 01:31:56,523
This for me?

1715
01:31:58,234 --> 01:32:00,193
I want you to be my eyes
out there, all right?

1716
01:32:02,279 --> 01:32:05,448
Any of these guys slack off,
you just let me know.

1717
01:32:06,242 --> 01:32:07,784
You bet I will.

1718
01:32:10,371 --> 01:32:13,289
- How you doing, Gerry?
- I'm all right, Coach.

1719
01:32:13,374 --> 01:32:15,792
I was just talking to these guys
about Marshall, trying to get 'em...

1720
01:32:15,876 --> 01:32:18,253
You don't need to talk
about football right now, Gerry.

1721
01:32:18,337 --> 01:32:21,089
I think this is a good time for reflection

1722
01:32:21,173 --> 01:32:23,591
- and for prayer...
- Coach...

1723
01:32:23,676 --> 01:32:24,926
I'm hurt.

1724
01:32:25,469 --> 01:32:26,928
I ain't dead.

1725
01:32:27,930 --> 01:32:31,140
No, you're not.

1726
01:32:32,893 --> 01:32:35,395
You know, I've been, uh, reading up

1727
01:32:35,688 --> 01:32:37,313
on the activities that they got for people

1728
01:32:37,398 --> 01:32:39,315
in wheelchairs and such.

1729
01:32:40,317 --> 01:32:41,985
They got Olympics.

1730
01:32:45,573 --> 01:32:47,156
This is the granddaddy

1731
01:32:47,241 --> 01:32:49,367
of state high school football
championships.

1732
01:32:49,451 --> 01:32:51,077
The Virginia AAA.

1733
01:32:51,287 --> 01:32:54,247
It just doesn't get any better.

1734
01:32:54,331 --> 01:32:56,207
We have
Coach Herman Boone's Titans

1735
01:32:56,292 --> 01:32:58,459
versus the legend, Ed Henry,

1736
01:32:58,627 --> 01:33:02,255
with over 250 wins in 30 years.

1737
01:33:04,508 --> 01:33:05,675
- Amen.
- Amen.

1738
01:33:10,180 --> 01:33:11,514
Let's go!

1739
01:33:12,349 --> 01:33:14,392
Lastik, what's the matter?

1740
01:33:15,227 --> 01:33:16,686
I'm eligible.

1741
01:33:18,689 --> 01:33:22,025
Well, I'm glad to hear that, son,
but I'm already married.

1742
01:33:22,818 --> 01:33:25,612
I got a C-plus average, Coach.

1743
01:33:27,031 --> 01:33:28,865
I'm going to college.

1744
01:33:29,325 --> 01:33:31,117
All right, fantastic.

1745
01:33:31,493 --> 01:33:33,244
Coach? Coach?

1746
01:33:34,079 --> 01:33:36,039
I just want to say I'm sorry.

1747
01:33:36,123 --> 01:33:38,374
You abandoned your team
in their moment of need, Petey.

1748
01:33:38,459 --> 01:33:40,877
- "Sorry" won't make up for that.
- Yeah, I know, but...

1749
01:33:40,961 --> 01:33:44,339
Listen, I want to play for you.
I want to play for the Championship.

1750
01:33:44,423 --> 01:33:47,675
You can play for me next year.
You sit on that bench.

1751
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:49,802
Show me you can support
your teammates.

1752
01:33:49,887 --> 01:33:52,180
You'll start again as a senior.

1753
01:33:59,521 --> 01:34:02,398
Entering the stadium now
is Jean Bertier.

1754
01:34:02,483 --> 01:34:07,111
Now, she's the mother of injured
AII-American Iinebacker, Gerry Bertier.

1755
01:34:07,196 --> 01:34:10,406
And the Titan fans
are really giving her a warm reception.

1756
01:34:22,086 --> 01:34:23,711
Gerry! Gerry! Gerry!

1757
01:34:23,796 --> 01:34:34,806
Gerry! Gerry! Gerry!

1758
01:34:37,267 --> 01:34:40,019
And here come
the Titans, entering the stadium

1759
01:34:40,104 --> 01:34:42,438
in what's become
their own unique style.

1760
01:34:42,523 --> 01:34:45,108
We feel, hoo, hah
Real good

1761
01:34:45,192 --> 01:34:47,026
Hoo, hah, we feel

1762
01:34:47,111 --> 01:34:48,611
Hoo, hah, real good

1763
01:34:48,696 --> 01:34:50,446
Hoo, hah, we feel

1764
01:34:50,531 --> 01:34:52,281
Hoo, hah, real good

1765
01:34:52,366 --> 01:34:54,242
Hoo, hah, we feel

1766
01:34:54,326 --> 01:34:55,952
Hoo, hah, real good

1767
01:34:56,328 --> 01:34:57,745
Hoo, hah, we feel

1768
01:34:58,247 --> 01:34:59,997
Hoo, hah, real good

1769
01:35:06,755 --> 01:35:08,464
Julius Campbell?

1770
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:12,260
Hi, I'm Emma Hoyt.

1771
01:35:13,721 --> 01:35:15,513
Oh. Oh, I guess we never met, huh?

1772
01:35:15,597 --> 01:35:17,432
Excuse me, young lady.
You can't be here right now.

1773
01:35:17,516 --> 01:35:20,184
You gonna have
to get back to your seat.

1774
01:35:22,521 --> 01:35:24,313
Well, now we've met.

1775
01:35:25,149 --> 01:35:27,316
Yeah. It's nice to meet you.

1776
01:35:27,651 --> 01:35:29,152
Good luck, Julius.

1777
01:35:29,236 --> 01:35:30,403
2! 21!

1778
01:35:30,487 --> 01:35:32,822
- Wait!
- What the hell's going on?

1779
01:35:32,990 --> 01:35:34,240
Shotgun.

1780
01:35:34,575 --> 01:35:36,159
Who do they think they are,
the New York Jets?

1781
01:35:37,161 --> 01:35:38,578
Switch! Switch!
Get 9!

1782
01:35:38,662 --> 01:35:40,163
Get 9! Bosley, move!

1783
01:35:40,247 --> 01:35:44,167
Move it up! Line up!
Get Bosley! Get 9! Get 9!

1784
01:35:45,794 --> 01:35:47,128
All right, let's go!

1785
01:35:47,212 --> 01:35:48,421
Hut hut!

1786
01:35:54,344 --> 01:35:56,929
- Real good.
- Keep it up. Shotgun rush.

1787
01:35:57,014 --> 01:35:59,182
Cover 3! Go to cover 3! Pass!

1788
01:36:00,058 --> 01:36:01,184
Hut!

1789
01:36:10,527 --> 01:36:11,986
Put some pressure on that Q.B.

1790
01:36:12,070 --> 01:36:13,321
They got all day to throw, Coach.

1791
01:36:13,405 --> 01:36:15,823
You just worry about your offense.

1792
01:36:17,201 --> 01:36:19,243
Let's go! Swing it! Swing it!

1793
01:36:19,328 --> 01:36:20,369
Set!

1794
01:36:20,454 --> 01:36:22,538
- Get set! Get set!
- Hut!

1795
01:36:22,623 --> 01:36:23,956
Yeah!

1796
01:36:30,172 --> 01:36:31,214
No!

1797
01:36:31,298 --> 01:36:32,715
What's wrong, Gerry?

1798
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:34,300
Do not come in here!

1799
01:36:36,595 --> 01:36:38,221
They got receivers
everywhere out there.

1800
01:36:38,305 --> 01:36:39,972
It's like watching
Monday Night Football.

1801
01:36:40,057 --> 01:36:42,058
Good hustle, good hustle, good hustle.

1802
01:36:42,142 --> 01:36:43,434
Just give him a little cushion.
Just give him a little cushion.

1803
01:36:43,519 --> 01:36:45,520
And when they throw that ball,
you stick him.

1804
01:36:45,604 --> 01:36:47,230
- Ready?
- Break!

1805
01:36:49,775 --> 01:36:50,983
Ready?

1806
01:36:51,401 --> 01:36:54,403
Red, 57!

1807
01:36:54,905 --> 01:36:57,240
Hut! Hut hut!

1808
01:37:02,621 --> 01:37:06,916
Titans star quarterback
Ronnie Bass gains six yards.

1809
01:37:07,751 --> 01:37:09,418
What you think?
You think we got a chance?

1810
01:37:09,503 --> 01:37:11,212
Got to give me some way
to disguise that coverage.

1811
01:37:11,296 --> 01:37:13,089
Let's start thinking about it. Let's go.

1812
01:37:13,173 --> 01:37:14,298
SUNSHINE: Ready!

1813
01:37:15,050 --> 01:37:17,093
Set! Hut!

1814
01:37:27,104 --> 01:37:29,981
They're a mile ahead of us.
He's a mile ahead of you, Coach.

1815
01:37:30,065 --> 01:37:32,859
If your defense would stop somebody,
we'd get the ball a little more.

1816
01:37:32,943 --> 01:37:34,652
Well, the Titans
gave 'em a scare,

1817
01:37:34,736 --> 01:37:37,363
but Ed Henry looks
supremely confident.

1818
01:37:37,447 --> 01:37:39,532
T.C. Williams goes in at the half

1819
01:37:39,616 --> 01:37:41,450
trailing 7-0.

1820
01:37:41,535 --> 01:37:42,660
Coach!

1821
01:37:43,078 --> 01:37:44,287
Sweetheart.

1822
01:37:44,371 --> 01:37:45,580
You better get back to your seat.

1823
01:37:45,664 --> 01:37:46,956
- I can't, Coach.
- What?

1824
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:49,458
Ed Henry's got Boone's number,
sure as shooting.

1825
01:37:49,543 --> 01:37:52,670
And you ain't doing nothing
against that shotgun.

1826
01:37:53,630 --> 01:37:56,507
Look, Coach,
now ain't the time to be proud.

1827
01:37:56,842 --> 01:37:59,260
All right. We're in a fight.

1828
01:38:00,762 --> 01:38:03,306
You boys are doing all that you can do.

1829
01:38:03,390 --> 01:38:05,182
Anybody can see that.

1830
01:38:06,268 --> 01:38:07,977
Win or lose,

1831
01:38:09,438 --> 01:38:11,564
we gonna walk out
of this stadium tonight

1832
01:38:11,648 --> 01:38:13,649
with our heads held high.

1833
01:38:15,152 --> 01:38:16,611
Do your best.

1834
01:38:16,695 --> 01:38:18,696
That's all anybody can ask for.

1835
01:38:18,780 --> 01:38:20,072
No, it ain't, Coach.

1836
01:38:20,157 --> 01:38:23,534
With all due respect,
you demanded more of us.

1837
01:38:23,619 --> 01:38:25,786
You demanded perfection.

1838
01:38:27,831 --> 01:38:30,166
Now, I ain't saying that
I'm perfect, 'cause I'm not.

1839
01:38:30,250 --> 01:38:33,002
And I ain't gonna never be.
None of us are.

1840
01:38:33,086 --> 01:38:36,714
But we have won every single
game we have played till now.

1841
01:38:37,090 --> 01:38:39,050
So this team is perfect.

1842
01:38:40,510 --> 01:38:43,512
We stepped out on that field
that way tonight.

1843
01:38:44,932 --> 01:38:46,974
And, if it's all the same
to you, Coach Boone,

1844
01:38:47,059 --> 01:38:49,352
- that's how we want to leave it.
- Yeah.

1845
01:38:50,646 --> 01:38:53,356
I hope you boys have learned
as much from me this year

1846
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:55,399
as I've learned from you.

1847
01:38:55,734 --> 01:38:59,070
You've taught this city
how to trust the soul of a man

1848
01:38:59,154 --> 01:39:00,863
rather than the look of him.

1849
01:39:00,948 --> 01:39:03,950
And I guess it's about time
I joined the club.

1850
01:39:04,242 --> 01:39:06,744
Herman! I sure could use your help.

1851
01:39:07,204 --> 01:39:09,038
Ed Henry's kicking my ass out there.

1852
01:39:09,539 --> 01:39:11,832
Listen up.
This is our time now.

1853
01:39:11,917 --> 01:39:13,834
Second half is our time!

1854
01:39:13,919 --> 01:39:15,670
We gonna make some changes
on defense.

1855
01:39:15,754 --> 01:39:17,046
They're spreading us out too far.

1856
01:39:17,130 --> 01:39:21,342
We gonna put Sunshine, Alan,
Glascoe, Davis.

1857
01:39:21,426 --> 01:39:24,053
You gonna play both ways,
rest of the game.

1858
01:39:24,137 --> 01:39:27,139
I don't want a receiver
to get across that line of scrimmage.

1859
01:39:27,224 --> 01:39:29,517
Coach Yoast will tell you
where you're playing, all right?

1860
01:39:29,601 --> 01:39:31,352
Let's go. It's our time. Everybody in.

1861
01:39:31,436 --> 01:39:33,396
Our time! Our time! Our time!

1862
01:39:33,480 --> 01:39:34,897
Titans on three. One, two, three!

1863
01:39:34,982 --> 01:39:36,190
Titans!

1864
01:39:36,274 --> 01:39:38,734
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

1865
01:39:39,194 --> 01:39:40,403
All right, Julius.

1866
01:39:40,487 --> 01:39:43,239
We're gonna go 52 Monster.
I know that's all you need to know.

1867
01:39:43,323 --> 01:39:45,449
All right, we're going zone, Alan.
I need...

1868
01:39:45,534 --> 01:39:46,951
Sir, I could play with Roosevelt.

1869
01:39:47,035 --> 01:39:49,453
But I cannot play with these guys.

1870
01:39:49,997 --> 01:39:52,206
No, I tell you what.
I didn't warm the bench all year

1871
01:39:52,290 --> 01:39:54,083
so I could watch us
go down on my account.

1872
01:39:54,167 --> 01:39:56,210
Put Petey in. He's better.

1873
01:39:57,754 --> 01:40:01,257
You want him to take your spot,
you go give it to him.

1874
01:40:02,634 --> 01:40:03,968
Thank you.

1875
01:40:18,775 --> 01:40:20,401
All right, Petey!

1876
01:40:20,610 --> 01:40:22,611
All right! That was beautiful!

1877
01:40:22,779 --> 01:40:24,280
Offense, let's go.

1878
01:40:44,384 --> 01:40:46,802
All right, Defense? Get out there!

1879
01:40:46,887 --> 01:40:48,262
Let's go! Let's stop 'em!

1880
01:40:48,346 --> 01:40:51,640
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1881
01:41:00,609 --> 01:41:03,194
O-2 inside veer. O-2 inside veer.

1882
01:41:15,832 --> 01:41:18,667
A field goal
attempt for T.C. Williams.

1883
01:41:18,752 --> 01:41:20,002
It's good!

1884
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:26,509
So they trail Marshall 7-3,

1885
01:41:26,593 --> 01:41:28,677
heading into the fourth quarter.

1886
01:41:28,762 --> 01:41:31,347
Ref! He's lining up offsides!
Look, 48's offsides!

1887
01:41:31,431 --> 01:41:33,182
Freeze right, 99 Z go.

1888
01:41:33,266 --> 01:41:34,892
Ref, I know you can see him!
You got eyes!

1889
01:41:34,976 --> 01:41:36,769
Gun right, 84, X-flat.

1890
01:41:36,853 --> 01:41:38,896
And tell Tommy to watch
the free safety. Go.

1891
01:41:38,980 --> 01:41:41,649
Get right in there, Blue.
You know what I'm talking about.

1892
01:41:41,733 --> 01:41:42,858
You can't be afraid.

1893
01:41:42,943 --> 01:41:46,195
He's offsides! He's lining up offsides!

1894
01:41:46,655 --> 01:41:48,364
Got to hold them here, Defense!

1895
01:41:48,448 --> 01:41:49,865
Hold 'em right here!

1896
01:41:49,950 --> 01:41:52,660
Pass! Pass!

1897
01:41:52,744 --> 01:41:55,079
Let's go, Offense. Let's go.

1898
01:41:58,667 --> 01:42:01,752
Titans trail Marshall 7-3.

1899
01:42:01,878 --> 01:42:03,337
AII Marshall has to do

1900
01:42:03,421 --> 01:42:04,421
is hold on to the ball,

1901
01:42:04,506 --> 01:42:06,257
and they will be the state champions.

1902
01:42:06,341 --> 01:42:08,259
Watch 'em on the weak side!

1903
01:42:08,343 --> 01:42:10,219
On the weak side!

1904
01:42:24,025 --> 01:42:26,235
Hold on to that ball, Petey!

1905
01:42:27,279 --> 01:42:29,196
Hold the ball! Hold the ball!

1906
01:42:29,322 --> 01:42:31,031
Hold on to that ball!

1907
01:42:31,116 --> 01:42:33,409
Hold on to that ball, Petey!

1908
01:42:34,786 --> 01:42:36,203
All right! All right!

1909
01:42:37,414 --> 01:42:39,123
All right, Petey!

1910
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:43,586
- Coach.
- Get a time-out! Time-out!

1911
01:42:43,670 --> 01:42:45,379
Coach, they're slanting to
our strong side every time.

1912
01:42:45,463 --> 01:42:47,089
You got to catch 'em in that slant
and let 'em over-pursue.

1913
01:42:47,174 --> 01:42:48,299
He's onto your game.

1914
01:42:48,383 --> 01:42:51,760
You got to throw something
at him he's not ready for.

1915
01:42:52,429 --> 01:42:54,722
- Rev! Where's Rev?
- Yes, sir.

1916
01:42:54,806 --> 01:42:57,057
- All right, listen, you ready to run?
- Yes, sir.

1917
01:42:57,142 --> 01:42:58,809
Fake 23 blast

1918
01:42:59,728 --> 01:43:01,228
with a backside George reverse.

1919
01:43:01,313 --> 01:43:03,105
You got that? Fake 23 blast

1920
01:43:03,231 --> 01:43:04,773
with a backside George reverse.

1921
01:43:04,858 --> 01:43:06,108
Like your life depended upon it.

1922
01:43:06,193 --> 01:43:08,068
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go get 'em!

1923
01:43:08,153 --> 01:43:11,780
The Titans take the field

1924
01:43:11,865 --> 01:43:13,866
with time to run one final play
for the State Championship.

1925
01:43:13,950 --> 01:43:15,784
I thought he was injured.

1926
01:43:15,869 --> 01:43:17,161
I guess not.

1927
01:43:17,245 --> 01:43:19,205
Why are they bringing in a Q.B.?

1928
01:43:19,289 --> 01:43:21,040
The Titans have 75 yards

1929
01:43:21,124 --> 01:43:22,625
to get to the end zone.

1930
01:43:22,709 --> 01:43:24,960
Oh, my gosh. I can't watch this.

1931
01:43:25,045 --> 01:43:28,339
- I can't watch this. No.
- What? What? Sheryl, what's wrong?

1932
01:43:28,423 --> 01:43:29,882
- No, I can't watch it.
- Sheryl!

1933
01:43:29,966 --> 01:43:32,760
No, it's too bad. Not now. Not now.

1934
01:43:36,264 --> 01:43:38,641
They're gonna throw it deep.
Cover deep!

1935
01:43:38,725 --> 01:43:41,060
Watch the deep pass! Cover it deep!

1936
01:43:41,144 --> 01:43:43,979
Ready! Set! Hut!

1937
01:44:25,605 --> 01:44:26,939
Well, that's it, boys.

1938
01:44:27,023 --> 01:44:28,357
That's it.

1939
01:44:28,900 --> 01:44:29,984
Good season.

1940
01:44:30,068 --> 01:44:31,610
It's all right.

1941
01:44:32,696 --> 01:44:34,071
Yes! Yes!

1942
01:44:34,489 --> 01:44:35,698
Come on.

1943
01:44:38,535 --> 01:44:40,286
- Congratulations, Coach.
- All right. Thank you, Coach.

1944
01:44:40,370 --> 01:44:42,663
You did a good job.
Played a fine game.

1945
01:44:43,206 --> 01:44:44,832
I know football,

1946
01:44:45,375 --> 01:44:47,543
but what you did with those boys...

1947
01:44:47,627 --> 01:44:50,421
You were the right man
for the job, Coach!

1948
01:44:51,172 --> 01:44:53,590
You're a Hall of Famer in my book.

1949
01:44:58,388 --> 01:44:59,388
Yeah!

1950
01:45:19,075 --> 01:45:21,618
The Titans danced their way
into history.

1951
01:45:21,703 --> 01:45:23,996
13 and 0, the perfect season.

1952
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:25,914
State Champions and first runner-up

1953
01:45:25,999 --> 01:45:27,833
for the National Championship.

1954
01:45:27,917 --> 01:45:30,794
Second-best high school team
in the country.

1955
01:45:30,879 --> 01:45:33,088
Gerry Bertier won a gold medal
for the shot put

1956
01:45:33,173 --> 01:45:34,465
in the Wheelchair Games.

1957
01:45:34,549 --> 01:45:36,216
Daddy coached him.

1958
01:45:36,926 --> 01:45:38,927
10 years Iater, Gerry died.

1959
01:45:39,429 --> 01:45:42,097
And that's what brought us
back here today.

1960
01:45:42,182 --> 01:45:44,808
Gerry is gone, but his spirit Iives on.

1961
01:45:46,353 --> 01:45:49,229
People say that it can't work,
black and white.

1962
01:45:49,314 --> 01:45:51,815
Well, here we make it work every day.

1963
01:45:51,941 --> 01:45:54,360
We have our disagreements,
of course.

1964
01:45:54,444 --> 01:45:56,320
But before we reach for hate,

1965
01:45:56,404 --> 01:45:59,698
always, always we remember
the Titans.

1966
01:46:12,754 --> 01:46:14,630
Goodbye

1967
01:46:17,133 --> 01:46:18,884
Na na na na

1968
01:46:24,182 --> 01:46:26,600
Hey, hey, hey

1969
01:46:28,269 --> 01:46:29,478
Goodbye
