<i>Pup Star</i> is going on world tour!

34
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:06,710
It is my absolute pleasure
to introduce our newest judge:

35
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:10,547
the one, the only Tiny!

36
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:18,680
Tiny, welcome back.

37
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:22,059
Oh, my goodness.
It's so great to be back, Jimmy.

38
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:25,437
Tell us,
how did this whole judge thing come about?

39
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:29,650
Did you ask them? Did they ask?
Did you take someone hostage?

40
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,943
- What happened here?
- You know, Jimmy,

41
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:36,281
there are so many amazing pups
around the world who deserve this chance.

42
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:40,160
I realized that even though
I loved being your <i>Pup Star</i> champion,

43
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:43,747
I was ready to help other dogs
fulfill their dreams.

44
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,583
She is quite a pup, huh?

45
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:49,336
What's next, Bark's back?

46
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,962

48
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:03,266
Our rehabilitation engineers
work around the clock

49
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,019
to turn wayward dogs into model citizens.

<i>Canine Correctional Magazine</i> voted us
two paws, making us number one

It's a ruse.

My ball therapy program reduces
inmate stress through exercise.

57
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:36,842
Now, I must warn you.

58
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,928
This prisoner may be
the single most evil dog

59
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:42,222
in the history of the world, ever.

60
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,390
His name...

61
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,142
is Bark.

62
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,687
You probably recognize him
from TV's <i>Pup Star.</i>

63
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:53,567
Now, this is the newest
behavior modification device.

64
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:57,070
It's used only
on the most hard-core cases.

65
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:58,822
Allow me to demonstrate.

66
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:04,369
Who's the cutest
and most talented Pup Star of all time?

[growls]

68
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,747

[electricity buzzing,
then groaning]

70
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,084
Tiny. It's Tiny.

71
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,628
She's amazing. Everyone loves her.

72
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,131
The results speak for themselves,

73
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,717
Bark is almost completely reformed.

74
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,012
Very interesting, warden,

75
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,764
but let's cut to the chase.

76
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:26,767
Where has the rest
of the taxpayers' money gone?

77
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:31,104
Anyhoo. Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm very busy. I have dogs to save.

78
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,107
- Butch.
- Right this way, folks.

79
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:36,026
Thank you.

80
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,907
[Butch] This facility was based
on a paw print by Frank Lloyd Bite.

81
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,369
All clear! Show's over.

82
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:48,997
[dogs chattering indistinctly]

83
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:54,377
Sorry, Bark.
I had to convince them it was real.

84
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,713
- I think they bought it.
- Get this off.

85
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:00,509
Here. Okay, there you go.

86
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:01,968
Now you put it on.

87
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,893
- There.
- The remote. Hand it over.

88
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:10,811
Fine.

91
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:24,074
You're right,
this new therapy is fantastic.

92
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:25,617
Now turn on the TV.

93
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,748
<i>This is the year to be on</i> Pup Star.

94
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:35,252
We all know you're leaving tomorrow
on a four-month tour,

95
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:39,005
so we thought a special send-off
was in order. What do think?

96
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:42,884
Oh, here comes another
of your hilarious pranks, Jimmy.

Gramps. What are you doing here,
you old scoundrel?

103
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:05,448
Wanted to pop in and wish
me number one grandson bon voyage.

104
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,659
You mind your P's and Q's, lad.

105
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:11,788
I will, Gramps. I promise.
Promise. Wish I could bring you with me.

106
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,832
Me, travel? Ho-ho.

107
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:18,128
Not blooming likely. I'll be at the pub
watching the Pup Star World Tour

108
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,839

Love you, nipper.

109

You look pretty, Mama.

I hear you're gonna be a jet-setter
around the globe.

132

Oh, so, now I'm embarrassing you.

137
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:38,541
I carry you for nearly 68 days,

Yes, Jimmy. They're right over there.

142
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:57,602
By my girl Lou, there's my dad Steven,
my nanny Ida, and Shep, my manager.

143
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:01,314
But, come on, now,
your crew wouldn't be complete without...

My tail, that's what.

148
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:12,701
Scraps,
how's the recording session going?

149
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,327
I'm crushing it.

150
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:17,205
Of course,
Scrappy will be defending her title.

151
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,542
I'm glad I'm not competing against her.

152
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,753

It's opportunity.

157
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:42,105
Judges! What's got you excited
about the tour?

158
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,566
Think of all the wardrobe possibilities.

159
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:48,194
I've had my stylist
working overtime for this.

160
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:50,530
My fans won't be disappointed.

161

So long, America.

163
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,459
I'm most excited to land, okay?

164
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:06,379
As far as I'm concerned,
dogs should keep four paws on the ground.

165
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,757
Wake me up when we get to New Delhi.

166
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:12,635
Simon! Are audiences really ready
for international talent?

167
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:17,015
Tour's already happening. A little late
for silly questions, isn't it?

168
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:22,520
Well, see you in four months, I guess.

169
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:24,147
Here goes nothing.

170
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,650
Maybe having your best friend
with you will help, huh?

171
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:31,071
- Wait, are you saying...?
- Surprise road trip?
