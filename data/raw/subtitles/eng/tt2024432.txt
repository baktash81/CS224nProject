00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,166
Hello? This is
Sandy Patterson.

2
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,446
<i>Yes, Mr. Patterson.</i>

3
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,041
<i>I'm Janine from the
Fraud Protection Department</i>

4
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,088
<i>of Identi-vault
Credit Monitoring Service.</i>

5
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,083
<i>We're calling today
because, unfortunately,</i>

6
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,528
<i>it appears that someone has
attempted to steal your identity.</i>

7
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,641
Are you kidding me?

8
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,446
<i>Gosh, I wish I were. We did
catch this in time, however.</i>

9
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,727
<i>But I do suggest
you taking advantage</i>

10
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,007
<i>of our free total
protection plan,</i>

11
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,921
<i>which safeguards your credit
rating against theft and fraud.</i>

12
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,890
Yes, please.
If it's free, absolutely.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,810
<i>Just terrific.
I went for this plan myself.</i>

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,570
<i>Mr. Patterson,
I'm gonna need to</i>

15
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,210
<i>verify some
information from you.</i>

16
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,364
I'm gonna need your
full name, date of birth,

17
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,126
and Social Security
number, please.

18
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,884
<i>Sure, understood.
Here it comes.</i>

19
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,407
What can I get for you?

20
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,641
I'm gonna have a melon ball.

21
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,842
And some tequila.
And let's start a tab.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,729
You got it.

23
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,006
And keep it open.

24
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,330
My friends can't make it.

25
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,525
Here I am, stuck with all these
premium tequila shots, so...

26
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,728
That's what we're drinking.

27
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,041
No.

28
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,287
My name's Sandy.

29
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,407
Hi, Sandy.

30
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,369
Okay. Cheers.

31
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,681
Mmm!

32
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,686
Let's get another round.

33
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,765
Chug! Chug! Chug!

34
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,129
Another round on me!

35
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,730
Sandy! Sandy! Sandy!

36
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,887
Who the hell is she?

37
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,610
Who cares?
She's buying free drinks.

38
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,281
Let's go!

39
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,247
When I say "Sandy,"
you say "Patterson."

40
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,289
- Sandy!
- Patterson!

41
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,089
Sandy!
Patterson!

42
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,924
Who wants another drink?

43
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,764
We do!

44
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,970
Enough. No more.

45
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,724
Ma'am, get down.

46
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,327
Who here wants to see me
swing on that chandelier?

47
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,928
No, no, no.
You can't be up there.

48
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,441
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

49
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,002
Uh, yeah, yeah, you can hear me,
because you're answering me.

50
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,481
Whoa, I didn't hear that either.

51
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,724
Here we go, bitches!

52
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,763
Ma'am, you've gotta get down.

53
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,241
Oh, shit.

54
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,005
Whoo-hoo!

55
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,290
Sandy! Sandy! Sandy!

56
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,807
It's over.
Shaw's over, okay?

57
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,486
You, you're out of here.
You're done, come on.

58
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,449
No. You're out of here.

59
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,047
Go back behind the bar and start
making more drinks for my friends.

60
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,487
These aren't
your friends, okay?

61
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,450
They like you because
you're buying them drinks.

62
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,602
People like you
don't have friends.

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,527
I think we're really hitting it off.
Don't you?

64
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,681
Sandy Patterson.

65
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,086
That's me.

66
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,084
You're under arrest for assault
and public intoxication.

67
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,844
I don't think that's accurate.

68
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,571
Blow into this.

69
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,165
Oh, my pleasure.

70
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,681
How did I do?

71
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,569
Huh. Look at that.

72
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,927
Happy birthday,
Sandy Patterson.

73
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,686
Shit.

74
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,243
All right, cheese!
There it is.

75
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,810
Happy birthday,
Sandy Patterson.

76
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,001
Happy birthday, Daddy.

77
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,440
Thank you.
Thank you all for coming.

78
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,082
Make a wish.
Here we go.

79
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,681
Bravo!

80
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,603
That's great. One lungful.

81
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,886
I made you this, Daddy.

82
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,008
Thank you. Look at that.

83
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,366
Did you see that, Mommy?
I did.

84
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,881
Looks very expensive.
Did you steal it?

85
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,680
This looks very expensive.

86
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,326
Little thief! You know what
happens to thieves? Huh?

87
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,290
Let me tell you what happens to a thief.
This is your punishment.

88
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,442
Be careful!
Just the face!

89
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,604
There it is. That's what you get!

90
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,685
Do you see?
Don't steal things.

91
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,167
All right, let's get a knife,
I want to start on this.

92
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,921
Come on, not on your birthday.

93
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,324
After rent, utilities, gas and
phone, we saved a little this month.

94
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,527
Ooh! How much?

95
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,926
<i>$14.03.</i>

96
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,685
Half of that's mine, you know.

97
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,164
You're welcome.
Invest it wisely.

98
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,402
What about your bonus?

99
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,449
They got canceled again.

100
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,480
It's the financial industry, I can't
exactly argue things are going well.

101
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,763
You're gonna get promoted.
Mmm-hmm.

102
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,841
You're going to.
It's fine, we're fine.

103
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,565
I know.
We are pregnant, though.

104
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,449
I'm pregnant.

105
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,362
Look at me. We're fine.

106
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,683
Until braces and
college and weddings.

107
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,327
Maybe this one's a boy
and we can send him to work.

108
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,528
Like, in a mine.

109
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,170
Yeah. It's a reasonable plan.

110
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,807
Oh!

111
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,009
I have one more present
for you to unwrap.

112
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,327
Oh!

113
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,122
Why don't we... Let's go, let's go.
Let's go to a room.

114
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,881
I rented a room in the back.

115
00:06:48,774 --> 00:06:50,264
Patterson.
Hi, good morning.

116
00:06:50,454 --> 00:06:51,235
Good morning.

117
00:06:51,294 --> 00:06:54,367
Hey. Did I ask you to pay for
the Westfield sweep account

118
00:06:54,391 --> 00:06:55,186
under the holding corp?

119
00:06:55,202 --> 00:06:56,203
Yeah.

120
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:57,283
Shit. It was supposed to...

121
00:06:57,362 --> 00:06:58,852
Supposed to be
under the subsidiary,

122
00:06:58,922 --> 00:07:00,333
so you could roll over
the qualified plan.

123
00:07:00,402 --> 00:07:01,927
I did it both ways.
I had a feeling.

124
00:07:02,082 --> 00:07:03,766
I knew you would.

125
00:07:03,922 --> 00:07:04,969
I'll e-mail it to you.

126
00:07:05,042 --> 00:07:06,123
You're the best, Patterson.

127
00:07:06,202 --> 00:07:07,283
Sandy.
Yeah?

128
00:07:07,082 --> 00:07:08,846
Cornish wants you
in his office.

129
00:07:15,482 --> 00:07:17,530
Hey, cheese dick.
Cheese dick? Me?

130
00:07:17,642 --> 00:07:18,609
I wanna talk to you.

131
00:07:18,722 --> 00:07:19,769
You got a minute?
Yeah, sorry.

132
00:07:19,842 --> 00:07:21,253
What have you been up to?

133
00:07:21,402 --> 00:07:22,847
Oh, I just got here, actually.
Just starting...

134
00:07:23,002 --> 00:07:24,686
I got the thing.
Oh, you got the thing.

135
00:07:24,922 --> 00:07:27,368
Uh-huh. Well, we could go...

136
00:07:28,042 --> 00:07:29,771
Okay, well, we'll meet then.

137
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,490
You process all the
in-house accounts, right?

138
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,607
I do.

139
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,968
I need you to cut some
bonus checks for me.

140
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,562
Bonus checks!
We have not...

141
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,846
Oh, that's great.

142
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,285
We have not had
them for 3 years,

143
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,566
I heard we weren't
getting them again.

144
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,005
Yeah, it's not a
company-wide bonus, though.

145
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,407
It's only on the partner level.
It's for retention.

146
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,481
Not for us.

147
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,846
The checks are being
cut to the people

148
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,160
on that list,
who are all partners,

149
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,925
but the retention program is to
keep the entire company healthy.

150
00:07:52,926 --> 00:07:54,052
Well, this is great news.

151
00:07:54,326 --> 00:07:56,806
I don't understand the tone of your voice.
You're acting like it's a...

152
00:07:56,966 --> 00:07:58,297
No, I was just so excited

153
00:07:58,406 --> 00:07:59,692
because we haven't had the
bonuses for 3 years.

154
00:07:59,766 --> 00:08:01,814
The company's doing well, I
thought maybe this was the day.

155
00:08:01,966 --> 00:08:03,726
Okay. Just because Harry
Cornish gets a bonus

156
00:08:03,766 --> 00:08:05,416
doesn't necessarily
mean that Peterson...

157
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:06,766
What's your
first name, Peterson?

158
00:08:07,006 --> 00:08:08,770
It's Sandy Patterson.

159
00:08:08,926 --> 00:08:10,007
Was that rough?

160
00:08:10,126 --> 00:08:12,777
The first name is...
No, it's Sandy Koufax.

161
00:08:12,846 --> 00:08:14,177
Oh, right.

162
00:08:14,326 --> 00:08:15,976
My dad was a big ball fan.

163
00:08:16,086 --> 00:08:17,975
Let me go cut these checks.

164
00:08:19,126 --> 00:08:20,127
You watch baseball?

165
00:08:20,206 --> 00:08:21,886
It just sounded funny,
the way you said it.

166
00:08:22,806 --> 00:08:24,846
I'll leave that one alone,
it's your dad.

167
00:08:25,086 --> 00:08:26,087
Oh, yeah. No.

168
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,168
Seriously, though, what is
it exactly that you do?

169
00:08:28,326 --> 00:08:29,726
I manage the
in-house accounts, sir.

170
00:08:29,766 --> 00:08:31,689
So, essentially,
you do what the program

171
00:08:31,766 --> 00:08:33,655
that my wife uses,
called Quicken, does.

172
00:08:34,006 --> 00:08:35,417
Well...
You put numbers in boxes.

173
00:08:35,606 --> 00:08:37,176
You could train a baboon
to do it, if you had to.

174
00:08:37,326 --> 00:08:39,772
The fact of the matter is,
the economy is changing.

175
00:08:39,926 --> 00:08:41,086
People like me are important.

176
00:08:41,126 --> 00:08:43,606
We bring the money in and pay
people like you with it.

177
00:08:43,846 --> 00:08:44,847
You understand?

178
00:08:45,206 --> 00:08:46,651
You know what? I'm gonna get you
a copy of The Fountainhead.

179
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:49,457
You're gonna read it, you're gonna
understand why this is good for everybody.

180
00:09:12,713 --> 00:09:13,714
Man.

181
00:09:20,528 --> 00:09:21,609
Sandy Patterson.

182
00:09:21,768 --> 00:09:24,578
<i>Hello, Sandy, I'm Jeanette
from Lady's Choice Salon.</i>

183
00:09:24,728 --> 00:09:27,359
<i>I'm calling to confirm your
appointment for this Friday at 3:00.</i>

184
00:09:27,368 --> 00:09:28,729
Sorry, you've got
the wrong number.

185
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:32,131
<i>Oh, is this
Sandy Bigelow Patterson?</i>

186
00:09:32,288 --> 00:09:33,972
Yeah. But...

187
00:09:35,688 --> 00:09:37,531
"407." Where is that?

188
00:09:37,688 --> 00:09:39,372
<i>Winter Park, Florida.</i>

189
00:09:39,528 --> 00:09:42,418
Okay. You've got Denver, here.
How did you dial this number?

190
00:09:42,568 --> 00:09:46,050
<i>Well, you didn't leave one when you made
the appointment, so we googled you.</i>

191
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:47,653
I see. Well,
you've got the wrong...

192
00:09:48,099 --> 00:09:48,700
Sorry, buddy.

193
00:09:49,196 --> 00:09:52,040
Can you meet me in the parking garage?
Level 7B.

194
00:09:52,047 --> 00:09:54,049
Sure.
Thanks.

195
00:10:00,037 --> 00:10:02,278
Hey. He's here.

196
00:10:06,617 --> 00:10:08,737
What's this? What's going on?
Is everything all right?

197
00:10:08,777 --> 00:10:09,858
You like getting fucked?

198
00:10:13,217 --> 00:10:15,299
Because that is what's
happening upstairs.

199
00:10:15,457 --> 00:10:17,858
Aren't you sick of
getting fucked by Cornish?

200
00:10:18,057 --> 00:10:20,298
Yeah, I'm a little sore.

201
00:10:20,697 --> 00:10:22,984
We don't like it either.
That's why we're leaving.

202
00:10:23,537 --> 00:10:27,337
We're starting our own firm.
We're taking all our clients.

203
00:10:28,057 --> 00:10:29,024
Come with us.

204
00:10:29,097 --> 00:10:30,303
Come with you?

205
00:10:30,377 --> 00:10:32,948
Sandy, you're the best
at what you do.

206
00:10:33,097 --> 00:10:35,987
You'd be a VP. You'll
have your own office.

207
00:10:36,137 --> 00:10:37,741
What are you making right now?

208
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:40,258
I make 50.

209
00:10:40,457 --> 00:10:41,743
How about 250?

210
00:11:02,171 --> 00:11:03,411
What?

211
00:11:19,851 --> 00:11:22,582
Oh! Boy, that's nice.

212
00:11:22,731 --> 00:11:26,781
That looks good, that looks good.
I lost my wedding ring. Shh!

213
00:11:27,331 --> 00:11:29,538
15 years of marriage.
Can you believe that?

214
00:11:29,971 --> 00:11:32,212
May I see your ID?
Mmm-hmm.

215
00:11:32,371 --> 00:11:33,372
Yes, you can.

216
00:11:34,211 --> 00:11:36,532
Sandy Bigelow Patterson.

217
00:11:37,091 --> 00:11:39,458
We just got married
back in St. Paul.

218
00:11:39,611 --> 00:11:41,375
Yeah. Howard's a surgeon.

219
00:11:41,531 --> 00:11:43,181
So, he fixes smiles.

220
00:11:49,651 --> 00:11:53,542
Yeah, he's kind of
the big guy for teeth.

221
00:11:54,371 --> 00:11:56,260
My friends took me out
for my birthday.

222
00:11:56,451 --> 00:11:59,102
They made a big deal
out of me turning 30.

223
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:02,653
I was like,
"30, what? No way."

224
00:12:02,771 --> 00:12:05,456
I mean, I hit it pretty hard
in my 20's, so...

225
00:12:05,611 --> 00:12:07,659
Do you like to hit it hard?

226
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:09,939
I bet you do.
I bet you can hit that

227
00:12:10,691 --> 00:12:11,692
so hard.

228
00:12:17,331 --> 00:12:19,095
There we go, okay.

229
00:12:19,251 --> 00:12:20,491
Let's get them off it.

230
00:12:27,011 --> 00:12:29,059
Ma'am? Ma'am.

231
00:12:30,931 --> 00:12:32,012
What the fuck?

232
00:12:32,771 --> 00:12:34,899
Ma'am, your card was declined.

233
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:36,781
Oh, yeah.

234
00:12:37,571 --> 00:12:38,572
Here, use this one.

235
00:12:39,211 --> 00:12:40,212
That one's done.

236
00:12:45,497 --> 00:12:46,498
Great.

237
00:13:24,147 --> 00:13:25,114
Hi. Good morning.

238
00:13:25,187 --> 00:13:27,872
Something wrong with pump 5.
It's not taking my card.

239
00:13:29,547 --> 00:13:30,787
Thanks.

240
00:13:34,507 --> 00:13:37,397
You don't pay your bills, man.
I gotta cut the card.

241
00:13:37,507 --> 00:13:39,509
"Cut the card."
No, I absolutely pay my bills.

242
00:13:39,587 --> 00:13:41,157
Run it one more time. Nothing
wrong with that card.

243
00:13:41,227 --> 00:13:42,388
That's not what
it says right here.

244
00:13:42,547 --> 00:13:43,958
I don't care what the screen says.
Maybe it's broken.

245
00:13:44,107 --> 00:13:45,871
I'll go somewhere else.
You're not cutting that card.

246
00:13:46,027 --> 00:13:47,517
Cutting the card?
That's ridiculous.

247
00:13:47,667 --> 00:13:49,396
Tell you what,
I'll go somewhere else.

248
00:13:49,547 --> 00:13:50,594
You go somewhere else?

249
00:13:50,667 --> 00:13:53,352
Look, that's my <i>papi.</i>
He owns this store.

250
00:13:53,507 --> 00:13:54,872
He says cut the card.
<i>Senor.</i>

251
00:13:55,027 --> 00:13:57,029
If you don't pay your bills...
My bills are paid.

252
00:13:57,187 --> 00:13:58,791
Oh, your bills are paid.
I gotta cut the card.

253
00:13:58,947 --> 00:14:00,073
Do not cut that card.

254
00:14:00,187 --> 00:14:02,269
I'm gonna cut the card.
I just cut the card.

255
00:14:04,027 --> 00:14:06,109
Go pay your bills, Randy.
It's Sandy.

256
00:14:06,267 --> 00:14:07,268
Sandy?

257
00:14:11,707 --> 00:14:13,709
How's my credit exceeded?

258
00:14:13,867 --> 00:14:18,907
<i>Well, Mr. Patterson,
your balance is $12,243.67.</i>

259
00:14:19,107 --> 00:14:23,874
That's absurd. I use the
card for gas and for coffee.

260
00:14:24,067 --> 00:14:28,231
<i>I'm showing $4,345 from
Great Beyond Water Sports.</i>

261
00:14:28,387 --> 00:14:30,594
Well, I'll stop you there, because
I've never heard of that place.

262
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:34,155
"Great Beyond Water Sports"?
Nope, I've never been there.

263
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:36,469
And that was this morning?
I just left the house.

264
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,829
Except for the gas station
that I went to,

265
00:14:38,907 --> 00:14:41,069
where my card
got chopped in half

266
00:14:41,227 --> 00:14:43,912
by an angry man in
a glass box, okay?

267
00:14:44,067 --> 00:14:47,230
So, first things first, I need
a fresh card in the mail.

268
00:14:47,427 --> 00:14:50,431
And Loretta, I need you on
the stick to unscrew me.

269
00:14:50,587 --> 00:14:53,511
This is clearly on your end.
This is not me.

270
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:55,590
Or I'll fix it.
Where's the surf shop?

271
00:14:55,747 --> 00:14:57,749
<i>Well, sir, it's in
Winter Park, Florida.</i>

272
00:14:57,907 --> 00:15:01,798
Florida? I'm in Colorado,
you know, so...

273
00:15:05,027 --> 00:15:06,597
- Damn it.
<i>- Excuse me?</i>

274
00:15:06,747 --> 00:15:08,715
Unbelievable. I gotta call you back.

275
00:15:08,787 --> 00:15:09,948
<i>Driver.</i>
Sorry!

276
00:15:10,027 --> 00:15:12,268
<i>Pull the vehicle to
the side of the road.</i>

277
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:17,833
<i>NCIC
says 10-29F, use caution.</i>

278
00:15:24,867 --> 00:15:26,631
Step out of the vehicle,
Mr. Patterson.

279
00:15:27,467 --> 00:15:30,277
Okay, coming out of the
vehicle for hands-free?

280
00:15:30,467 --> 00:15:32,310
That seems just
a little bit excessive.

281
00:15:32,387 --> 00:15:33,434
Mr. Patterson,
you're under arrest.

282
00:15:33,507 --> 00:15:34,508
Under arrest?

283
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:35,714
You have the right
to remain silent.

284
00:15:35,787 --> 00:15:36,834
Hey, wait a second.

285
00:15:36,987 --> 00:15:40,355
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

286
00:15:40,947 --> 00:15:43,791
The arresting officer ran
your license through the NCIC.

287
00:15:43,947 --> 00:15:46,632
You were booked for felony assault
2 weeks ago in Florida.

288
00:15:46,787 --> 00:15:49,313
What? No, I wasn't.
What are you talking about?

289
00:15:49,467 --> 00:15:51,435
I've never even been to Florida.
You've never been to Florida?

290
00:15:51,507 --> 00:15:53,874
No, sir. This whole morning...

291
00:15:54,467 --> 00:15:57,471
Well, hang on a second.
Was it Winter Park, Florida?

292
00:15:57,547 --> 00:15:58,548
See, that's good.

293
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:00,317
We're dropping the whole
"there's been a mistake" thing.

294
00:16:00,467 --> 00:16:01,878
I got it now. Listen...

295
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:03,438
The problem is,
Mr. Patterson,

296
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:06,232
is that you missed your court
date 3 days ago in Florida.

297
00:16:06,307 --> 00:16:07,467
Officer, let me just explain.

298
00:16:07,507 --> 00:16:10,590
And the judge has issued a
warrant for your arrest.

299
00:16:11,347 --> 00:16:12,348
Yeah...
So what we're gonna do

300
00:16:12,507 --> 00:16:14,157
is we're gonna go ahead and
ship you back down to Florida.

301
00:16:14,227 --> 00:16:15,308
You can work on your tan.

302
00:16:15,387 --> 00:16:16,434
Sir. Yeah, listen.
You're not listening.

303
00:16:16,507 --> 00:16:17,554
Sit down.
Sorry.

304
00:16:17,707 --> 00:16:19,232
There's a person
that has my same name

305
00:16:19,307 --> 00:16:20,752
that is doing
things in Florida.

306
00:16:20,907 --> 00:16:24,832
This guy is making salon appointments,
he's buying beach equipment.

307
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:26,597
He's maxing out my credit card.

308
00:16:26,747 --> 00:16:30,638
Are you Sandy Bigelow
Patterson, born May 18th, 1974?

309
00:16:30,707 --> 00:16:31,754
That is you, correct?

310
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:33,392
Yeah, but it's not
me doing this stuff.

311
00:16:33,547 --> 00:16:35,868
I've never even been to the state.
I'm here with you guys.

312
00:16:36,027 --> 00:16:38,268
I'm in Colorado.
How can I be in Florida?

313
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:42,747
Call Winter Park PD.
Pull the mug shot.

314
00:16:45,867 --> 00:16:47,631
Okay, uncuff him.

315
00:16:47,787 --> 00:16:50,472
Uncuff me. That's great.

316
00:16:50,627 --> 00:16:52,231
Can I see?

317
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:54,748
Whoa.

318
00:16:55,387 --> 00:16:56,388
Is that a woman?

319
00:16:56,587 --> 00:16:59,238
If I had to guess, it's the
woman that stole your identity,

320
00:16:59,387 --> 00:17:02,311
obviously taking advantage of the
fact that you have a female name.

321
00:17:02,387 --> 00:17:04,196
Oh, it's not female,
it's unisex.

322
00:17:04,547 --> 00:17:07,067
When you say "stole my identity,"
do you mean credit card fraud?

323
00:17:07,107 --> 00:17:08,313
Oh, no, no, it's a lot
worse than that.

324
00:17:08,387 --> 00:17:09,752
See, what happens is,
they get a hold of

325
00:17:09,827 --> 00:17:11,158
your name, your birthday,
Social Security.

326
00:17:11,227 --> 00:17:12,911
And then they run up debt,

327
00:17:13,067 --> 00:17:14,557
get arrested,
commit crimes as you.

328
00:17:14,707 --> 00:17:16,197
What do you do now? You
go down, you go get her?

329
00:17:16,387 --> 00:17:19,436
Oh, no, we don't go get anyone.
Let me walk you out.

330
00:17:19,587 --> 00:17:22,909
See, we're Denver PD. All we
do is open and close the case.

331
00:17:23,067 --> 00:17:24,910
Now, if she buys
something on Amazon,

332
00:17:24,987 --> 00:17:26,796
then Seattle PD
would investigate.

333
00:17:26,947 --> 00:17:29,791
Your mobile company's in Ohio,
then Cleveland PD handles that.

334
00:17:29,947 --> 00:17:31,631
Then so on and so forth
for every single theft.

335
00:17:31,787 --> 00:17:33,869
Well, hang on. How long
does all this take?

336
00:17:34,027 --> 00:17:35,836
About 6 months to a year.

337
00:17:35,907 --> 00:17:36,908
A Year?

338
00:17:37,067 --> 00:17:38,148
Yeah. So why don't
you go ahead

339
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:40,269
and just leave your contact
information with this gentleman here?

340
00:17:40,347 --> 00:17:42,475
You might want to hold on to this
mug shot in case you may need it.

341
00:17:42,547 --> 00:17:43,514
Great. Okay.

342
00:17:43,587 --> 00:17:45,157
Listen, I'm gonna
need this solved

343
00:17:45,227 --> 00:17:46,672
a whole lot quicker
than a year, Detective.

344
00:17:46,747 --> 00:17:49,388
Okay, listen, I understand that
this is really frustrating for you,

345
00:17:49,427 --> 00:17:51,714
but our percentage rate in solving
these cases is pretty high.

346
00:17:51,787 --> 00:17:52,834
Yeah? How many?

347
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:54,187
About 5 to 10 percent.

348
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:56,354
That's garbage.

349
00:17:56,507 --> 00:17:58,589
We'll be in touch
with you, Sandy.

350
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:19,490
Patterson?
Sorry.

351
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:22,410
I had a hell of a morning.

352
00:18:22,479 --> 00:18:23,526
Listen to this.
Can you explain this to me?

353
00:18:23,947 --> 00:18:24,648
What do you got?

354
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,624
These are emails I received from
a couple of prospective clients.

355
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,681
No, no, no.

356
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,524
You defaulted on
6 credit cards?

357
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,602
No, I didn't, actually.
You did.

358
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,801
No. You have 9
other delinquencies.

359
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,120
This is what my morning's
been all about.

360
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,567
Your credit score's a 240.
A 240!

361
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,405
There are homeless people with
better numbers than that, Sandy.

362
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,608
Dude, you have a warrant
out for your arrest.

363
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,250
This is
a financial institution.

364
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,449
How am I supposed to give you
access to $5 billion in funds?

365
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,965
My identity's been stolen.

366
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,841
I was at the police
station all morning.

367
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,201
Don't worry about it, though.

368
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,691
I'm gonna get on the phone,
I'm going to clean it up.

369
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,967
They can run my credit tomorrow
and it's gonna be fine, okay?

370
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,246
What the fuck is this?

371
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,085
Those are cops!
That's my guy.

372
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,083
This is the detective
that's handling my case.

373
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,369
Hi. I was just filling my
boss in on our situation.

374
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,604
Did you find her? Do you
have some good news?

375
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,762
No, I'm sorry, we don't
have any good news.

376
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,366
Soon after you left, we got
a call from Orlando Metro.

377
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,571
They just busted a narcotics
dealer named Paolo Gordon.

378
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,405
Your name and your credit
cards turned up in connection

379
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,811
with the investigation.

380
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,166
Ah! This...

381
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,521
One of my colleagues spoke to your
former employer, Mr. Harold Cornish.

382
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,567
Yeah.

383
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,086
And he said that, in fact,
you are a drug dealer.

384
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,371
That's...
He's a fucking liar.

385
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,171
I've got a warrant
to search the premises.

386
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,924
For drugs.
Oh.

387
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,205
And guns.

388
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,760
This is a waste of time.
I understand.

389
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,366
It's not me, it's the
woman in the picture.

390
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,085
Just doing my job.
I need to put that out.

391
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,730
Okay.

392
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,803
Okay, guys, let's...

393
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,000
Okay, we're done.

394
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,725
You can let your
employees back in now.

395
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,841
Thank you.

396
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,843
So, no Oxy?
No, no Oxy.

397
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,047
Did you find my weapons?

398
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,403
I'm not an idiot,
Mr. Patterson, okay?

399
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,244
I know almost certainly
it's the woman in Florida.

400
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,441
Yeah.

401
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,568
But until we know for sure
that you didn't do this,

402
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,846
it's an open investigation.

403
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,331
For narcotics.

404
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,161
Let me walk you out.

405
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,040
We're gonna have to
talk about our options.

406
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,329
I think we got to let you go.

407
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,164
I know where she is. Hey!

408
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,284
I know exactly where she's
gonna be tomorrow afternoon.

409
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,442
If I tell you, you can tell the
Winter Park Police Department,

410
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,682
they can grab her,
and we're done.

411
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,882
No, no, it doesn't work like that.
Why not?

412
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,281
Well, they'd have to bring her
up on local charges first.

413
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,527
And it would pretty much be about a
year before we get a shot at her.

414
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,763
I mean, she'd have to be standing
right here to do you any good.

415
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,849
That's the new
standard of police work?

416
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,127
I mean, the criminal's got to be
standing right in front of you?

417
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,964
Have a good day.
Hang on, hang on.

418
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,202
If they won't bring her here,
what if I bring her here?

419
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,486
What if, somehow,
I get her here,

420
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,607
and I put her right
in front of you,

421
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,961
she gives you a full statement
and owns up to everything?

422
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,730
Then we'd be done, wouldn't we?

423
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,405
Oh, I wouldn't recommend that,
Mr. Patterson.

424
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,130
You see, criminals
generally just don't

425
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,730
volunteer confessions
to policemen.

426
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,167
All right, what about this?

427
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,561
What about if I ask
her to talk to you?

428
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,724
Because she cost me my job
and I want to get my job back,

429
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,486
and in return,
I don't press any charges.

430
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,086
She doesn't have to worry about me.
There's no cops.

431
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,321
But there are cops.

432
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,528
You're down the hall, you're
listening to a thing. I'm wearing...

433
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,125
What?
That's ridiculous.

434
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,800
No, no, no, this sort of thing
tends to work pretty well. Right?

435
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,325
And we do have enough
for an eavesdrop warrant.

436
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,880
No, no. Sandy, I need somebody
here doing the work right now.

437
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,088
I'm the best at what I do.
Those are your words.

438
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,480
I'm just looking for
a little bit of time.

439
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,041
We don't have time. I'm supposed
to put everything on hold?

440
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,121
We have clients!

441
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,567
Listen, I gave up everything because I
believe in you. Just believe in me.

442
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,325
Come on, you know me.
Come on, Daniel.

443
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,889
I'll give you one week.
Really?

444
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,961
But that's it.

445
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,441
That's all I need. Thank you.

446
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,681
One week, Patterson!

447
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,286
I'm calling to confirm my wife's
appointment for tomorrow at 3:00.

448
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,522
Thank you. She ended up
making the appointment.

449
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,445
I didn't realize that she's
gonna be in the area.

450
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,207
Anyway, I need your address
because she lost it.

451
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,442
Okay. Got it. Thank you.

452
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,642
She'll see you tomorrow
at 3:00. Bye-bye.

453
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,486
Okay. I've got cash for the plane
ticket, I've got my sock money.

454
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,483
Did you call the cab?
Don't do this.

455
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,484
Don't start this again. Trish, I
need you to just hang in there.

456
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,165
This is not who we are.

457
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,725
You're not Batman.
Do not unpack this.

458
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,484
Please, I can't
refold all this stuff.

459
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,369
Do you even know
how to use those?

460
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,522
It's just in case.
It is my only option.

461
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,729
It is our only option.

462
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,640
Let me see the picture
of her again.

463
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,646
Make you feel
better to see that?

464
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,721
Uh-huh.

465
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,161
Yeah. She's not dangerous.

466
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,410
That number right
there is her height.

467
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,762
It's hobbit height.

468
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,011
I'm going after Bilbo.

469
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,122
Yeah, I can do this,
I really can.

470
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,009
But I can't do it
without your support.

471
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,002
Okay? Please trust me.

472
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,241
Thank you.

473
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,364
If all goes well, I'll be right
back here tomorrow night.

474
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,761
Also, I borrowed
your anxiety pills

475
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,365
because I might have to
coax her onto the airplane.

476
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,010
Oh, good.
Okay, that's fine

477
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,681
'cause why would I
need those right now?

478
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,727
I'll call you
when I land, okay?

479
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,921
Goodbye, you guys.

480
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,042
Daddy, the TV's broken.

481
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,408
Oh. Well, you know.
Come here.

482
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:39,042
Some things are broken,
but only for a few days.

483
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,600
That's why I have
to go on this trip

484
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,085
to pretty much the worst
place in America.

485
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,924
But Daddy's gonna
fix these problems.

486
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,208
When I get back,
it's all gonna be perfect.

487
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,567
I promise, okay? Come here.

488
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,563
It's too late for TV anyway,
you guys are going to bed.

489
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,406
Do some drawing,
and then PJs. Goodbye.

490
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,200
Go get this bitch.

491
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,966
Roger.

492
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,726
Ooh!

493
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,687
Okay.

494
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,921
Okay.

495
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,806
My neck.
Oh, man, I taste blood.

496
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,805
Oh, jeez.

497
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,086
You got an injury.

498
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,282
Oh, my neck. My neck got it.
Sorry about that.

499
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,249
I didn't assume you were
gonna come to a full stop

500
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,441
in the middle of the highway.

501
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,484
Oh, a mama badger and a
baby crossing the road.

502
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,606
A badger, huh?

503
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,091
Yeah. Oh, my God.

504
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,881
My fibromyalgia's just
shooting down my spine.

505
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,724
Jeez Louise.

506
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,968
No, this is totally my fault.
You got your license on you?

507
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,565
Why don't we swap information?

508
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,489
We can get the insurance
companies involved.

509
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,966
I guess that's
what it comes to.

510
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:57,841
I hate to tell you, but that's
a custom paint job. Thank you.

511
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,687
You know,
if it's okay with you,

512
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,367
I'm okay and I'm cool
with just doing cash.

513
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:10,242
Yeah, cash would be a lot easier,
wouldn't it, Sandy Bigelow Patterson?

514
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,287
Yeah.

515
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,885
Bigelow is such a rare name.

516
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,883
Well, it's a family name,
you know.

517
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,850
It goes back to the Mayflower.

518
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,121
Is that right?

519
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,611
Yeah. Jeremiah Bigelow.

520
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,003
Maybe you've heard of him.
Pretty prominent bear hunter.

521
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,810
Sounds brave.
Kind of a big deal.

522
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,442
Here's my license
with my name right there.

523
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,365
Sandy Bigelow Patterson.

524
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,321
Gotcha.

525
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,002
Ow! Not my hair, you fuck!

526
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,164
You're not going anywhere.

527
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,771
Get out of the car!

528
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,042
Ow! Keep it!

529
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,725
Took the lift out of the crown!

530
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,128
I fucking just had it done!

531
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,610
No, no, no!

532
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,201
What, are you crazy?

533
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,285
What are you doing?

534
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,840
You're looking for these? You're
not gonna find them, stupid.

535
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,884
See you, Sandy!

536
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,404
Oh, come on.

537
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,327
Hi.

538
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,607
<i>Hey, it's me.
Is this a bad time?</i>

539
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,728
No, great time.
What's going on, honey?

540
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,009
<i>We just got a call from a debt
collector from Fiat Automotive.</i>

541
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,122
<i>They said we're behind
on some payments.</i>

542
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:49,086
A call from a...
From a debt collector, huh?

543
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,049
<i>I guess she
bought herself a car.</i>

544
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,202
Well, honey, that is just...

545
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,248
You sound really weird.
Are you sure you're okay?

546
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,245
Yeah, I'm good.

547
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,090
Okay.

548
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:15,570
Let's see what kind of crap you
have in your bag, Sandy Patterson.

549
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,650
Here you go. Thanks.

550
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,688
Ooh! Nice.

551
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,650
Ding-dong!
Shit.

552
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,040
Put it down.

553
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,648
Now, we're gonna have a little chat.
Okay.

554
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:03,361
Okay? We can do it the hard way,
or we can do it the easy way.

555
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,770
I'd like to pick the easy way.

556
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,560
Get over here and
give me your wrists.

557
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,369
Okay.

558
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,200
Now, I have a plan...

559
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,122
Shit! I'm a lady,
you fucking animal.

560
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,964
Give me your wrist.
Stop fighting me.

561
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,611
Yeah, I'll fight it. You like that?
You like that?

562
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,728
How about that?
You like hitting girls?

563
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,370
Sandy? This isn't cute, Sandy!

564
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,527
Stay down!

565
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,046
Oh, shit!

566
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,887
Shit.

567
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,846
Shit, shit. Ow!

568
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,927
Ha!

569
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,607
Stay down.

570
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,444
You threw like a fucking girl.

571
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,529
Now, once you hear my plan,
you're gonna wanna come with me.

572
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,444
I'm not going
anywhere with you!

573
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,170
Fuck you, Sandy. Damn it. Stop
right there and listen to me.

574
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:49,006
No, go home to your shitty wife
and your fucking dumb-ass kids.

575
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,127
Stop right there!

576
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,925
Why did you do that?

577
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,161
You did that.

578
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,640
Well, that was not
the easy way.

579
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,246
I loved that guitar.
I'm gonna sue you.

580
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,640
You're gonna sue me?

581
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,690
Really, you're gonna sue me?
Enjoy the empty accounts.

582
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,330
I'll be taking my car keys.

583
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,324
And what are these?

584
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,441
These are future victims?

585
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,806
Put my shit down.

586
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,961
They can thank me later.

587
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,769
Is that how you buy all this crap?
What do you need this for?

588
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,841
You're sick.

589
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:22,051
This stuff is things I use for my
charity that I help children with.

590
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,207
For the what?

591
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,964
For my children's charity,
you dick.

592
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,401
Oh, that makes sense.
I apologize.

593
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,170
Now, you're coming with me.
Give me your wrist.

594
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,765
What's your name, by the way?

595
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,724
Julia.
Julia?

596
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,089
Diana!
Open the fucking door!

597
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,124
Shit!

598
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,287
Who's that?

599
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,886
Just changing my clothes.
I'll be right out!

600
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:44,726
Don't lie to me. Those credit
cards you sold Paolo were shit.

601
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,609
No, no, no,
it's a misunderstanding.

602
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,604
It will be so funny when I
explain it to you guys.

603
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,330
You're coming with us, now!

604
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,607
Just give me the car keys.

605
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,170
No, you're not
taking the car again.

606
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,966
Shit!

607
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,882
Go, go, go!

608
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,969
What? What the...

609
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,167
You little bitch.

610
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,924
You just make friends
wherever you go, huh?

611
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,003
Who were those people?
Don't worry about it.

612
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,763
And what the hell is that?
Is that a bobby pin?

613
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,081
Yep, sure as shit is.

614
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,526
You're wasting your time.
That's not coming off.

615
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,841
Yeah, we'll see about that.

616
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,650
How about you just apologize
for getting me shot at?

617
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,881
I'm not gonna
apologize for that

618
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:41,011
because you should not
have broken into my home.

619
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,680
So, it's a little
lesson for you, Sandy.

620
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,251
Pull over.
I'm not pulling over.

621
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,925
We're going to an airport

622
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,287
and we're taking the first
flight to Denver, Diana.

623
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,727
Why don't you pull over
before I kick your ass again?

624
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,291
As soon as I explain it, you're
gonna come with me. All right?

625
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,320
I'll tell you what, why don't we find
a bar, we calm down a little bit...

626
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,807
I buy you a drink, I talk, you listen?
Does that sound fair?

627
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,769
That sounds fair, Sandy.

628
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,285
You'll behave yourself
if we find a bar?

629
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,726
Oh, totally.
Great.

630
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,881
Yeah, I'll behave myself

631
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,803
because you will
have probably dosed me

632
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,689
with a shitload of
Trish Patterson's Xanax.

633
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,966
Hey, when did you get those?

634
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,282
I had two hands down your
pants, and you didn't notice,

635
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,283
so you should deal with that.

636
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,766
Fucking dead below the waist.

637
00:32:16,136 --> 00:32:17,183
You're disgusting.

638
00:32:17,456 --> 00:32:18,787
Just pull the car over.

639
00:32:18,856 --> 00:32:19,896
Is that what you want?
Yes.

640
00:32:20,016 --> 00:32:21,216
Jesus Christ, yes.

641
00:32:21,216 --> 00:32:24,538
Here you go. You're sure? Right
in the middle of the highway.

642
00:32:24,616 --> 00:32:25,663
Yeah, right in the middle
of the highway.

643
00:32:25,736 --> 00:32:26,783
Really?

644
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:30,939
All right. I'll tell you what, then.
I'll just call the police

645
00:32:31,016 --> 00:32:32,666
and I'll tell them that
there's a criminal

646
00:32:32,736 --> 00:32:34,340
out here with a known warrant

647
00:32:34,416 --> 00:32:35,941
just hanging around
the highway.

648
00:32:36,176 --> 00:32:37,860
I got a lot of evidence
they'd like to see.

649
00:32:38,936 --> 00:32:40,267
You got nothing.

650
00:32:40,856 --> 00:32:43,985
Hey! I'm calling
the police right now.

651
00:32:44,136 --> 00:32:46,218
Good luck, pal.
I'll be long gone.

652
00:32:46,376 --> 00:32:48,105
It's ringing.

653
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,626
What are you, a fucking Kenyan?

654
00:32:54,416 --> 00:32:56,987
Listen, I just need
you to talk to my boss.

655
00:32:57,136 --> 00:32:58,501
That's it. And I won't
press charges, okay?

656
00:32:58,656 --> 00:33:00,067
I'm losing my job
because of you.

657
00:33:00,136 --> 00:33:01,262
Your job?
That's right.

658
00:33:01,336 --> 00:33:02,497
I didn't fire you.

659
00:33:02,656 --> 00:33:04,499
Effectively, you did.
I don't think I did.

660
00:33:04,656 --> 00:33:07,016
And I don't wanna go to Colorado
and meet your anxious wife.

661
00:33:07,136 --> 00:33:08,581
You're right, she is anxious.
She's very anxious.

662
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:09,783
You wanna know why?

663
00:33:09,976 --> 00:33:12,263
Because we have 2 daughters
and a third on the way.

664
00:33:12,416 --> 00:33:13,656
We live in a very,
very small apartment,

665
00:33:13,856 --> 00:33:16,097
about half the size of that
house I bet you stole.

666
00:33:16,256 --> 00:33:17,577
Hey, I worked hard
for that house.

667
00:33:17,872 --> 00:33:18,919
Enough, all right?

668
00:33:19,032 --> 00:33:22,400
This is a free trip, okay?
It's on me, all right?

669
00:33:22,472 --> 00:33:23,678
No cops.

670
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:25,436
All you need to do is talk
to my boss, that's it.

671
00:33:25,672 --> 00:33:27,959
And then we're done. That's all.
It's very simple.

672
00:33:28,112 --> 00:33:29,398
Come on, it's in Denver.
You're gonna love it.

673
00:33:29,472 --> 00:33:30,758
There's nobody
shooting at you there.

674
00:33:30,832 --> 00:33:32,312
You stay here,
they're gonna find you.

675
00:33:34,352 --> 00:33:35,478
Hey, hey, hey!

676
00:33:38,432 --> 00:33:39,957
Come on.

677
00:33:40,112 --> 00:33:41,921
This is ridiculous.

678
00:33:43,992 --> 00:33:44,993
Shit.

679
00:33:45,072 --> 00:33:46,073
You blow a tire?

680
00:33:47,152 --> 00:33:48,677
Yeah, I blew a fucking tire.

681
00:33:48,832 --> 00:33:50,193
Why don't you
rest that in the car?

682
00:33:50,792 --> 00:33:52,203
Put the air on.

683
00:33:52,952 --> 00:33:54,317
I won't talk to the cops.

684
00:33:54,472 --> 00:33:56,361
Right, no cops.
I said that.

685
00:33:56,472 --> 00:33:57,473
And don't lie to me.

686
00:33:57,592 --> 00:33:59,321
I'm not.
I'm not lying, I swear.

687
00:33:59,472 --> 00:34:00,917
Yeah? You swear
on your kids?

688
00:34:02,592 --> 00:34:04,356
Yeah, swear on your kids.

689
00:34:04,512 --> 00:34:07,118
Yes, I swear on my kids.

690
00:34:10,672 --> 00:34:12,117
Shotgun.

691
00:34:13,198 --> 00:34:14,404
I'll need the keys.

692
00:34:14,478 --> 00:34:15,639
Here you go.

693
00:34:15,798 --> 00:34:17,482
Thank you.

694
00:34:30,478 --> 00:34:32,526
- Yeah?
<i>- Did you get her?</i>

695
00:34:32,598 --> 00:34:33,599
Almost.

696
00:34:33,678 --> 00:34:34,725
<i>Almost?</i>

697
00:34:34,878 --> 00:34:38,724
Okay, then I almost won't kill
you when I get out of here.

698
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:42,405
She's a nobody who sells
credit cards she already used.

699
00:34:42,558 --> 00:34:43,798
We'll get the money back.

700
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:45,523
<i>It is beyond that, Marisol.</i>

701
00:34:45,678 --> 00:34:49,683
Now, this nobody of yours is
causing me a big problem.

702
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:51,920
<i>She's become a liability.</i>

703
00:34:52,078 --> 00:34:54,160
One of her cards
tipped off the cops.

704
00:34:54,878 --> 00:34:58,564
She gotta go. You get
Julian and you get it done.

705
00:34:59,398 --> 00:35:02,083
Okay, but she's with some guy.

706
00:35:02,238 --> 00:35:05,526
You kill her, you kill him,
you kill anyone you need to.

707
00:35:05,878 --> 00:35:07,039
Okay.

708
00:35:07,198 --> 00:35:08,927
Speed this
shit up, we gotta go.

709
00:35:09,918 --> 00:35:11,761
- I don't work for you.
- Oh, yes, you do.

710
00:35:12,198 --> 00:35:13,563
Hank!

711
00:35:14,678 --> 00:35:16,043
You got it, Paolo.

712
00:35:17,598 --> 00:35:19,965
So, I was wondering,

713
00:35:20,158 --> 00:35:22,684
how is it that we're
getting on that plane?

714
00:35:23,198 --> 00:35:26,486
I already have my ticket,
and I brought cash for yours.

715
00:35:26,638 --> 00:35:29,403
Are we both going to show our
Sandy Bigelow Patterson,

716
00:35:29,558 --> 00:35:31,879
same birthday, everything,
at the same time?

717
00:35:31,958 --> 00:35:35,087
Let the airline just have a
field day with that, or...

718
00:35:35,438 --> 00:35:36,724
Yeah, that's what I thought.

719
00:35:37,918 --> 00:35:39,249
Son of a bitch!

720
00:35:43,038 --> 00:35:44,642
Well, we're driving now.
We're driving, then.

721
00:35:44,798 --> 00:35:46,163
Okay.

722
00:35:47,718 --> 00:35:50,119
Oh! I can't believe
I missed that.

723
00:35:51,918 --> 00:35:53,647
You've gotta feel so dumb.

724
00:35:53,798 --> 00:35:55,368
Please don't.

725
00:35:56,278 --> 00:35:58,246
Think we just need
a little music.

726
00:36:31,438 --> 00:36:32,769
Dude, I can hit this.

727
00:36:49,798 --> 00:36:51,562
Hello? Yeah?
What do you got?

728
00:36:51,718 --> 00:36:54,039
<i>Got a runner.
Pays 50 K.</i>

729
00:36:54,198 --> 00:36:55,802
50 K?
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

730
00:36:56,038 --> 00:36:57,119
You got a name?

731
00:36:57,198 --> 00:36:59,599
<i>Sandy Patterson. She
skipped a few court dates.</i>

732
00:36:59,798 --> 00:37:00,845
Any leads?

733
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:02,204
<i>Yeah, she just
swiped a credit card</i>

734
00:37:02,278 --> 00:37:04,724
<i>at a place near you
called Lady's Choice.</i>

735
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:18,729
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
We're closed.

736
00:37:18,878 --> 00:37:21,722
Do you know a Sandy Patterson?
A customer?

737
00:37:21,878 --> 00:37:24,722
Used a credit card here
earlier today around 4:00?

738
00:37:24,878 --> 00:37:26,118
You her boyfriend or something?

739
00:37:26,238 --> 00:37:27,239
Oh, no, no.

740
00:37:28,678 --> 00:37:31,727
No. I'm a skiptracer.
A collector.

741
00:37:32,078 --> 00:37:33,921
Like a bounty hunter.

742
00:37:34,078 --> 00:37:38,083
I find people that owe money and I
bring them back to where they belong.

743
00:37:38,238 --> 00:37:40,161
Oh, this Sandy, she owe a lot?

744
00:37:40,318 --> 00:37:43,003
Yeah, well, they don't
send me for a little.

745
00:37:43,398 --> 00:37:47,084
No, she jumped bail and I've
been hired to bring her back.

746
00:37:47,758 --> 00:37:49,044
I would like to help you out,

747
00:37:49,198 --> 00:37:51,599
but I ain't supposed to share
client information, so...

748
00:37:51,758 --> 00:37:54,045
Of course, I understand.

749
00:37:56,598 --> 00:37:57,884
This is a nice place.

750
00:37:58,038 --> 00:37:59,005
Yeah.

751
00:38:07,598 --> 00:38:09,407
I hear this stuff's
pretty flammable.

752
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:17,167
Be a shame if your place of
employment burned to shit.

753
00:38:18,558 --> 00:38:20,799
You want to show me where
that appointment book is?

754
00:38:21,998 --> 00:38:22,999
There you go.

755
00:38:24,404 --> 00:38:26,466
Yeah, not what I was planning,

756
00:38:26,524 --> 00:38:29,494
but I will be home on Sunday
or Monday by the latest.

757
00:38:29,804 --> 00:38:32,205
It is what it is, I guess.
How are the girls?

758
00:38:33,564 --> 00:38:35,214
Okay. I love you, too.

759
00:38:35,364 --> 00:38:37,970
I'll call you later. Bye.

760
00:38:40,364 --> 00:38:42,935
How long have you
guys been together?

761
00:38:44,164 --> 00:38:45,609
I'm not going to
talk about myself.

762
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:49,604
Or my family. You're never going
to know anything about me.

763
00:38:49,804 --> 00:38:52,648
There's nothing wrong
with being a simple guy.

764
00:38:52,804 --> 00:38:54,010
I'm just a simple gal.

765
00:38:54,964 --> 00:38:58,173
From Wisconsin. You know?
I'm a cheesehead.

766
00:38:58,324 --> 00:38:59,371
Fascinating.

767
00:38:59,484 --> 00:39:00,485
I'm from Morganville.

768
00:39:00,644 --> 00:39:03,215
It's a little, tiny town,
but charming.

769
00:39:03,404 --> 00:39:04,451
I don't care.

770
00:39:04,524 --> 00:39:06,891
Mom's 70. Still working.

771
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:09,615
Dad retired about, I guess, two and a...

772
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,892
I want to say two and a half years.
Two, two and a half...

773
00:39:12,044 --> 00:39:13,933
Jesus Christ.
Two and a half years ago.

774
00:39:14,124 --> 00:39:16,126
He was a principal
at a middle school.

775
00:39:16,284 --> 00:39:17,365
They sound so normal.

776
00:39:17,524 --> 00:39:19,526
How'd they have a criminal
asshole for a daughter

777
00:39:19,604 --> 00:39:21,049
who just goes around
wrecking people's lives?

778
00:39:21,124 --> 00:39:22,250
How'd that work out?

779
00:39:22,249 --> 00:39:25,378
We're kind of in the midst of a
pivotal moment here, you know?

780
00:39:25,569 --> 00:39:26,570
This is...

781
00:39:27,369 --> 00:39:29,975
I think we might want
to take stock of this.

782
00:39:30,449 --> 00:39:33,312
We're kind of bonding.

783
00:39:33,335 --> 00:39:35,463
I mean... I just want to
be up front and say

784
00:39:35,615 --> 00:39:37,026
that I visually enjoy you.

785
00:39:37,495 --> 00:39:38,621
Hmm.

786
00:39:39,699 --> 00:39:44,421
And I've always, you know,
really liked tall men.

787
00:39:45,539 --> 00:39:48,702
What are you talking...
I'm average height.

788
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:50,059
Not to me, stretch.

789
00:39:51,179 --> 00:39:52,180
Great.

790
00:39:52,499 --> 00:39:54,866
Look at that.
See that? "Adventure."

791
00:39:55,019 --> 00:39:56,703
I love that.

792
00:39:56,859 --> 00:39:57,940
When are we going to pull over?

793
00:39:58,019 --> 00:39:59,066
We're not.

794
00:39:59,299 --> 00:40:02,965
You know, they say driving tired is
more dangerous than driving drunk

795
00:40:03,019 --> 00:40:05,499
and that's a statistical fact.

796
00:40:06,659 --> 00:40:07,306
I doubt it.

797
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,650
Fine... all I'm saying is
I drive drunk all the time.

798
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,219
Never had a problem. I slept-drove
once and I smashed right into a

799
00:40:15,219 --> 00:40:17,220
Taco Bell/Pizza Hut combo.
I slammed that thing

800
00:40:17,971 --> 00:40:19,548
split it right down the middle.

801
00:40:23,043 --> 00:40:24,488
Welcome to the Colonnade.

802
00:40:24,643 --> 00:40:25,849
How y'all doing?

803
00:40:26,003 --> 00:40:28,051
Good.
We're famished, though.

804
00:40:28,203 --> 00:40:30,490
We just drove all
the way from Gibson, so.

805
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,935
All right y'all take a booth.

806
00:40:32,935 --> 00:40:34,699
Oh! This is nice.

807
00:40:35,415 --> 00:40:38,498
It's a nice... nice comfy booth.

808
00:40:38,755 --> 00:40:40,166
Soft.

809
00:40:42,324 --> 00:40:45,089
Now, I have allotted
us each $8 per meal,

810
00:40:46,785 --> 00:40:49,470
so it looks like
you can get one of the...

811
00:40:50,065 --> 00:40:51,794
One of the salads
or a soup or...

812
00:40:52,025 --> 00:40:53,026
Sorry, I'm quick.

813
00:40:53,185 --> 00:40:55,552
The tomato soup for me,
please. That'll do it.

814
00:40:55,705 --> 00:40:58,390
I'm going to take a full
slab of the baby backs,

815
00:40:58,705 --> 00:41:01,356
and I'm going to take that
with mashed taters,

816
00:41:01,505 --> 00:41:05,476
hushpuppies and I'm going
to have a sweet tea.

817
00:41:05,665 --> 00:41:06,746
The fuck you are.

818
00:41:07,385 --> 00:41:09,547
I don't know what that means.

819
00:41:09,905 --> 00:41:11,509
I asked you to eat less food.

820
00:41:13,985 --> 00:41:15,146
What is wrong with you?

821
00:41:15,505 --> 00:41:16,995
This is a beautiful woman.

822
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:18,386
You let her eat.

823
00:41:19,585 --> 00:41:21,394
No, he's right.

824
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:24,992
You know, I've put on a little bit
of weight because of all the stress.

825
00:41:25,185 --> 00:41:27,108
Walter is a fireman.

826
00:41:27,265 --> 00:41:29,916
Yeah. It's okay, it's okay.

827
00:41:30,105 --> 00:41:32,790
He was in a pretty intense...

828
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:33,946
She doesn't care.

829
00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:37,916
...accident last year, and
he injured his male parts.

830
00:41:38,505 --> 00:41:40,553
Oh. They're just
shredded down there.

831
00:41:40,705 --> 00:41:42,150
And now he can't work.

832
00:41:42,305 --> 00:41:44,114
He wants to fight fires,

833
00:41:45,185 --> 00:41:46,789
and he wants to
pee standing up.

834
00:41:47,265 --> 00:41:50,951
Don't you want to pee standing up?
I know you do, but he can't.

835
00:41:51,025 --> 00:41:52,151
Just bring two soups.

836
00:41:52,225 --> 00:41:56,071
And he can't lay with me
like a husband should,

837
00:41:56,145 --> 00:41:57,556
on account of the injury.

838
00:41:57,625 --> 00:41:58,785
And I don't even need him to,

839
00:41:58,905 --> 00:42:02,148
but he gets mad at me,
and takes his anger out on me.

840
00:42:02,345 --> 00:42:03,870
And then I feel
bad about myself

841
00:42:03,945 --> 00:42:05,515
and I feel ugly,
and then I eat.

842
00:42:05,665 --> 00:42:08,032
Lord knows, I know I eat.
I know I do.

843
00:42:08,225 --> 00:42:11,707
No, no. You just wait
right here, sweetheart, okay?

844
00:42:11,865 --> 00:42:13,071
Okay.

845
00:42:13,265 --> 00:42:14,425
I'm going to wait right here.

846
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:15,546
<i>God.</i>

847
00:42:15,705 --> 00:42:16,786
You're breaking the rules.

848
00:42:16,905 --> 00:42:18,270
You understand that?
You're breaking the rules.

849
00:42:18,425 --> 00:42:20,189
Society can't function
without rules.

850
00:42:20,265 --> 00:42:21,391
Ah.

851
00:42:21,465 --> 00:42:22,512
You follow the rules, right?

852
00:42:22,585 --> 00:42:23,632
I sure do.

853
00:42:23,865 --> 00:42:25,469
Oh, yeah, how's that
working out for you?

854
00:42:26,425 --> 00:42:28,553
Yeah. Hold on just a minute.

855
00:42:31,545 --> 00:42:35,755
This is from the buffet,
and it is on the house.

856
00:42:35,905 --> 00:42:37,066
That's so sweet.

857
00:42:39,225 --> 00:42:40,511
Enjoy your soup.

858
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,876
And if you have to pee, the
ladies' room is right back there.

859
00:42:45,345 --> 00:42:47,951
God bless you. God bless you.
All right. Okay, okay.

860
00:42:52,185 --> 00:42:53,596
You know what a sociopath is?

861
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:55,909
Do they like ribs?

862
00:42:58,185 --> 00:43:01,155
Hey, how you doing? I need
one room, two beds, please.

863
00:43:01,225 --> 00:43:02,226
Oh, sorry.

864
00:43:02,305 --> 00:43:04,467
We only have
single beds left tonight.

865
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:05,911
Are you kidding me?
Nope.

866
00:43:06,065 --> 00:43:08,113
We don't really mind.
I mean, it's an inconvenience,

867
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:11,473
but my husband can't really
digest stuff anyway

868
00:43:11,585 --> 00:43:14,270
because of his intestinal surgery,
so just comp us the mini-bar.

869
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,665
He can digest Pringles.

870
00:43:15,825 --> 00:43:17,987
Right, that's right. I'm Walt.
This is the wife, Myra.

871
00:43:18,145 --> 00:43:20,671
She's a functional idiot.
Wears diapers like a chimp.

872
00:43:20,725 --> 00:43:22,250
I'm running her
down to Disneyland.

873
00:43:22,325 --> 00:43:23,770
She loves the noise
and the sugar.

874
00:43:23,845 --> 00:43:24,892
He's just tired from the drive.

875
00:43:24,965 --> 00:43:26,535
We're going to have to figure
out the mattress thing

876
00:43:26,605 --> 00:43:27,970
because even though
I can't have sex with her

877
00:43:28,165 --> 00:43:29,849
due to my cock and balls
getting shot off

878
00:43:29,925 --> 00:43:31,165
in an apparent
warehouse fire...

879
00:43:31,205 --> 00:43:32,172
Oh, shit.

880
00:43:32,245 --> 00:43:33,765
I wouldn't share
a bed with her anyway.

881
00:43:33,845 --> 00:43:36,291
I'd much rather sleep on the floor.
Do you want to know why?

882
00:43:36,445 --> 00:43:37,446
Because you got no dick?

883
00:43:37,605 --> 00:43:40,495
Close. It's because
she repulses me.

884
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,413
She's the worst
person I've ever met.

885
00:43:43,845 --> 00:43:46,132
Screw you. You got a bar?

886
00:43:46,285 --> 00:43:48,014
Yeah, the Foxhole.
It's across the lot.

887
00:43:48,165 --> 00:43:50,247
Thank you. You're not
going to the Foxhole.

888
00:43:50,405 --> 00:43:53,170
Hey. I don't need to go to Denver.
You need me to go to Denver.

889
00:43:53,325 --> 00:43:55,248
No splitting up.

890
00:43:55,445 --> 00:43:56,526
Do you still want the room?

891
00:43:56,605 --> 00:43:58,414
Yeah, I do, real quick.

892
00:43:58,485 --> 00:43:59,646
Fucking chimp on the loose.

893
00:43:59,805 --> 00:44:01,967
It's not my business, I'm
really sorry about your dick,

894
00:44:02,285 --> 00:44:06,085
but you got to treat your lady
better, or somebody else is gonna.

895
00:44:06,725 --> 00:44:09,125
Appreciate it. Are we on the set
of your talk show right now?

896
00:44:09,765 --> 00:44:11,608
Do you know what?
Being nice is a choice.

897
00:44:11,765 --> 00:44:13,005
Can I just get the fucking key?

898
00:44:13,525 --> 00:44:15,254
Uh... Oh!
Are you in a hurry?

899
00:44:15,885 --> 00:44:17,250
Oh, no.

900
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:19,169
I have to go get
this magnetized,

901
00:44:19,245 --> 00:44:20,974
because it wasn't
magnetized properly.

902
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:22,446
This might take a while.

903
00:44:24,025 --> 00:44:25,390
Can I have a double melon ball?

904
00:44:29,825 --> 00:44:30,986
Thanks.

905
00:44:32,625 --> 00:44:33,865
Is that a melon ball?

906
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:35,552
Yep.

907
00:44:38,345 --> 00:44:39,631
Do you like milkshakes?

908
00:44:39,905 --> 00:44:41,270
I'm just trying
to have a drink.

909
00:44:41,425 --> 00:44:45,066
Sorry, that probably sounded like
a dumb pickup line, I apologize.

910
00:44:50,745 --> 00:44:52,509
I don't like milkshakes,
I love them.

911
00:44:55,145 --> 00:44:56,271
You're going to
flip out over these.

912
00:44:56,425 --> 00:44:58,473
Stu, mix us up
two grasshoppers.

913
00:44:59,425 --> 00:45:00,506
Oh!

914
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:04,031
I'm Big Chuck.

915
00:45:04,185 --> 00:45:05,425
Yes, you are.

916
00:45:06,265 --> 00:45:07,232
I'm Margie.

917
00:45:07,345 --> 00:45:09,347
Pleasure to make your acquaintance.
You, too.

918
00:45:09,985 --> 00:45:12,465
I love a man
that wears jewelry.

919
00:45:12,625 --> 00:45:14,275
Thank you very much.

920
00:45:15,265 --> 00:45:17,950
I like my turquoise
like I like my women,

921
00:45:18,105 --> 00:45:19,948
American and top-grade.
Oh!

922
00:45:20,545 --> 00:45:21,706
100%.

923
00:45:21,785 --> 00:45:23,389
100%.

924
00:45:23,785 --> 00:45:25,116
To you.

925
00:45:35,869 --> 00:45:38,349
Release it. Let it burn.

926
00:45:38,759 --> 00:45:40,443
Mmm!
Mmm mmm mmm.

927
00:45:42,625 --> 00:45:43,626
Down it goes.

928
00:45:48,305 --> 00:45:49,352
Hey.

929
00:45:49,425 --> 00:45:51,666
You're here five minutes, you
already made a friend, huh?

930
00:45:51,985 --> 00:45:53,350
This must be Walter.

931
00:45:53,425 --> 00:45:54,426
- Walter.
- Hello.

932
00:45:54,505 --> 00:45:56,587
Howdy, Walt. I'm Big Chuck.
Hi, there.

933
00:45:56,745 --> 00:45:59,988
I got to tell you, this little
Margie is quite a lady.

934
00:46:00,145 --> 00:46:02,147
- Oh, "Margie"?
- Sit your ass down.

935
00:46:02,305 --> 00:46:04,831
Drinks are on me. Stu's going to set you up.
I wish I could.

936
00:46:04,985 --> 00:46:06,987
Stu, let's get Walt a round.
His dick's broken.

937
00:46:07,145 --> 00:46:10,149
It's much, much too late.
Never mind, Stu. I got to...

938
00:46:10,305 --> 00:46:12,467
Honey, I got to
get you out of here.

939
00:46:12,665 --> 00:46:16,306
Here's the thing,
I don't want to go.

940
00:46:16,505 --> 00:46:17,506
But it's super late.

941
00:46:17,665 --> 00:46:19,986
We got to get all the way
to St. Louis tomorrow, so...

942
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:22,035
I think we got a good one.

943
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:23,397
What is that?

944
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:24,995
I think we got a good one.

945
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:27,875
Listen, I'm going to
tell you what's going on.

946
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:32,200
Walt likes to watch.

947
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:34,195
Walt's a watcher.

948
00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:36,951
Oh!

949
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:37,837
No.

950
00:46:37,891 --> 00:46:39,097
He likes to watch
me with other men.

951
00:46:40,282 --> 00:46:40,855
He does?

952
00:46:40,855 --> 00:46:42,186
Yeah, that's how
he gets aroused.

953
00:46:42,335 --> 00:46:43,780
You got a little
bone-bone now, huh?

954
00:46:43,975 --> 00:46:45,943
I'd really like to go, though.

955
00:46:46,095 --> 00:46:48,462
Here we go. It's time to go.
He said so.

956
00:46:48,655 --> 00:46:49,736
Yeah.

957
00:46:49,815 --> 00:46:51,465
And I'm going to go
out on the dance floor

958
00:46:51,535 --> 00:46:52,582
and we're going
to dance real slow.

959
00:46:52,655 --> 00:46:53,622
No, no, no.

960
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:57,142
And we're going to dance real
close, and you can stay and watch.

961
00:46:57,215 --> 00:46:59,582
Or you can go.
That's your choice.

962
00:46:59,735 --> 00:47:01,155
I can't go.
You know I can't go.

963
00:47:01,155 --> 00:47:02,316
Thanks for your help, pal.

964
00:47:02,635 --> 00:47:05,559
Well, well.
We got us a watcher.

965
00:47:05,795 --> 00:47:08,366
Ohhh! We got a watcher!

966
00:47:10,115 --> 00:47:11,276
Honey, look.

967
00:47:19,273 --> 00:47:21,275
Walt!

968
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,261
Thanks for the walk home.

969
00:47:42,411 --> 00:47:45,779
We made it, but as you can see,
l am getting ready for bed.

970
00:47:45,971 --> 00:47:49,737
Please say your goodnights. No,
no, meaning, "Leave, please."

971
00:47:50,411 --> 00:47:51,651
Don't shut the door.
Leave it...

972
00:47:53,011 --> 00:47:54,251
Now what do I do?

973
00:47:54,411 --> 00:47:56,778
Oh, now, this is
his favorite part.

974
00:47:56,971 --> 00:47:57,972
Okay.

975
00:47:58,091 --> 00:47:59,581
He likes to be
humiliated verbally.

976
00:47:59,651 --> 00:48:00,777
No, I don't.

977
00:48:00,931 --> 00:48:02,899
You little sissy boy. Huh?

978
00:48:02,971 --> 00:48:04,097
It's enough of this.

979
00:48:04,171 --> 00:48:06,742
Sissy boy, huh?
You hard now?

980
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:08,252
I'm inverted.

981
00:48:08,371 --> 00:48:11,739
Now it's time to give him
the Big Chuck show.

982
00:48:16,411 --> 00:48:19,255
No need for the show.
Put it back on.

983
00:48:34,251 --> 00:48:36,299
Mmm-mmm.
I've had enough show.

984
00:48:37,731 --> 00:48:40,052
Oh! Shake it,
shake it, shake it!

985
00:48:42,771 --> 00:48:45,217
Ohhh! Look at him
peeking over here.

986
00:48:45,371 --> 00:48:46,975
I can't let her
out of my sight.

987
00:48:47,131 --> 00:48:49,452
He's not going anywhere. You
are right in his sweet spot.

988
00:48:49,651 --> 00:48:50,857
Now what do I do?

989
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:53,696
I want you to
take him physically.

990
00:48:53,851 --> 00:48:56,138
Let's not cross a line.
Hey, Chas.

991
00:48:56,291 --> 00:48:57,941
Relax, Walt.
Friend.

992
00:48:58,011 --> 00:48:59,536
Big Chuck likes to share.

993
00:48:59,691 --> 00:49:00,817
I don't want
anything you've got.

994
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:04,612
Why don't you and me share?

995
00:49:04,891 --> 00:49:05,938
Okay. God damn it.

996
00:49:06,091 --> 00:49:07,297
I'm sleeping in the bathroom.

997
00:49:08,491 --> 00:49:10,573
Oh! Here it comes.

998
00:49:10,731 --> 00:49:13,018
There it was, right there.
Uh-oh!

999
00:49:13,851 --> 00:49:16,138
Looks like it's
just me and you now.

1000
00:49:18,731 --> 00:49:23,498
It sure is. I'm going to
make tonight so special.

1001
00:49:23,811 --> 00:49:25,859
Backing up. Oh, no!

1002
00:49:27,217 --> 00:49:29,140
You know what?

1003
00:49:29,568 --> 00:49:31,775
I'm going to swim in there.

1004
00:49:33,848 --> 00:49:38,172
I'm going to make you one of
my special famous cocktails.

1005
00:49:38,328 --> 00:49:41,298
Well, I hope that cocktail
has a punch.

1006
00:49:41,448 --> 00:49:43,416
Oh, you know what?
You're going to love it.

1007
00:49:43,568 --> 00:49:45,169
I'm going to love it
because you made it.

1008
00:49:50,248 --> 00:49:52,535
It's going to be so good.

1009
00:50:05,288 --> 00:50:07,370
I don't know if I can do this.

1010
00:50:11,488 --> 00:50:12,978
Yeah, that's okay.

1011
00:50:14,128 --> 00:50:17,257
I wasn't really in
the mood for it anyway.

1012
00:50:17,408 --> 00:50:18,853
No, I'm sorry.

1013
00:50:19,008 --> 00:50:20,169
It's not a big deal.

1014
00:50:20,248 --> 00:50:23,172
It's just that I ain't been with
another woman since my wife passed.

1015
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:29,730
And I'm sorry, because here you
are, and you're so beautiful.

1016
00:50:31,728 --> 00:50:33,776
And you're so colorful.

1017
00:50:36,448 --> 00:50:38,496
You look
like Dorothy from <i>The Oz.</i>

1018
00:50:39,048 --> 00:50:40,413
Flowers.

1019
00:50:41,728 --> 00:50:44,095
And I do, I appreciate y'all

1020
00:50:45,168 --> 00:50:49,571
inviting me up here to your super
fucking weird sexual tryst,

1021
00:50:52,408 --> 00:50:53,409
but I'm scared.

1022
00:50:54,768 --> 00:50:56,338
Oh, Big Chuck.

1023
00:50:56,808 --> 00:50:58,173
I do like you.

1024
00:50:59,128 --> 00:51:00,698
I really do.

1025
00:51:06,008 --> 00:51:07,931
Margie.

1026
00:51:08,488 --> 00:51:09,649
Yes?

1027
00:51:10,408 --> 00:51:12,376
I do want to make love to you.

1028
00:51:14,648 --> 00:51:16,537
Oh, my God. Take me.

1029
00:51:22,888 --> 00:51:23,889
Oh, God!

1030
00:51:24,048 --> 00:51:26,016
Call me Big Papa Huge Time.
Big Papa Huge Time!

1031
00:51:26,653 --> 00:51:28,576
Call me Big Papa Huge Time.

1032
00:51:28,653 --> 00:51:30,223
Big Papa Huge Time!

1033
00:51:32,161 --> 00:51:33,359
Shut up!

1034
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:34,684
- Oh!
- Oh, God!

1035
00:51:34,684 --> 00:51:35,731
Feel the thunder, baby!

1036
00:51:35,844 --> 00:51:37,369
Get on top!

1037
00:51:39,004 --> 00:51:40,847
Fuck me!

1038
00:51:41,044 --> 00:51:42,330
Break my hip!
I'll break it.

1039
00:51:42,444 --> 00:51:43,684
Break my fucking hip!

1040
00:51:43,884 --> 00:51:47,331
Rub it clockwise!
Clockwise, clockwise!

1041
00:51:47,644 --> 00:51:49,373
What do you say?
I say, "Mama."

1042
00:51:49,524 --> 00:51:51,686
Stick them both in. Pull them taut.

1043
00:51:51,844 --> 00:51:53,812
How many is that?
What the hell is that?

1044
00:51:54,004 --> 00:51:55,005
Come on!

1045
00:51:55,084 --> 00:51:56,370
Stop! Foxhole! Foxhole!

1046
00:51:56,884 --> 00:51:58,488
The safe word's "foxhole,"
God damn it!

1047
00:52:06,324 --> 00:52:07,689
Here it comes!

1048
00:52:08,124 --> 00:52:09,125
Mmm.

1049
00:52:09,324 --> 00:52:12,134
Big Chuck will be ready for
round two in just a minute.

1050
00:52:12,244 --> 00:52:15,373
I'll tell
you, Walt's a lucky guy.

1051
00:52:16,044 --> 00:52:17,887
You are such a good person.

1052
00:52:43,844 --> 00:52:44,845
Diana?

1053
00:52:52,804 --> 00:52:53,805
Diana!

1054
00:53:38,284 --> 00:53:40,013
<i>Hello? Daddy?</i>

1055
00:53:41,004 --> 00:53:43,371
<i>Daddy. Hello?</i>

1056
00:53:44,484 --> 00:53:45,565
<i>Are you there?</i>

1057
00:53:55,404 --> 00:53:56,929
Fuck.

1058
00:54:16,684 --> 00:54:18,846
I was just checking our ice.

1059
00:54:39,724 --> 00:54:40,725
Morning.

1060
00:54:42,044 --> 00:54:46,891
I just have flashes of
hearing an elephant and...

1061
00:54:47,044 --> 00:54:49,206
Oh, God.
I'm just real sore.

1062
00:54:49,364 --> 00:54:51,332
I'll bet you're just torn to shit.
Get in the car.

1063
00:54:51,644 --> 00:54:52,884
I think he really ripped it.

1064
00:54:53,044 --> 00:54:54,205
You might have to look.

1065
00:54:54,364 --> 00:54:56,366
I'm going to return the
card key to the front desk.

1066
00:54:56,484 --> 00:54:58,213
I'm going to be watching. If you
take a step out of the car,

1067
00:54:58,284 --> 00:54:59,695
I'm going to kill you. I'm serious.
Get in the car.

1068
00:54:59,764 --> 00:55:01,971
I got to have the keys.
I got to put the air on.

1069
00:55:02,124 --> 00:55:03,614
Never going to happen.
Swing a leg.

1070
00:55:03,764 --> 00:55:05,164
Can you get me
some Strawberry Quik?

1071
00:55:05,204 --> 00:55:06,808
Because I gotta
balance my electrolytes.

1072
00:55:06,964 --> 00:55:07,965
If they've got it.

1073
00:55:08,604 --> 00:55:10,413
Strawberry Quik.

1074
00:55:14,404 --> 00:55:17,055
Hey. Good morning.
I'm checking out of 192.

1075
00:55:18,724 --> 00:55:19,771
Did you enjoy your stay, sir?

1076
00:55:19,844 --> 00:55:20,845
No.

1077
00:55:21,044 --> 00:55:22,250
That's good.

1078
00:55:22,404 --> 00:55:24,213
Do you sell Strawberry Quik?

1079
00:55:24,364 --> 00:55:25,934
Yes. You want some?

1080
00:55:26,404 --> 00:55:27,405
Not today.

1081
00:55:30,404 --> 00:55:32,008
This coffee over here free?

1082
00:55:32,164 --> 00:55:33,768
Yeah.
Super.

1083
00:55:33,924 --> 00:55:38,054
Creamer used to be 50 cents, but
everyone was stealing it anyway.

1084
00:55:38,764 --> 00:55:40,254
Okay.

1085
00:55:54,924 --> 00:55:58,451
The interstate is just south of here, right?
Is there a gas...

1086
00:55:58,764 --> 00:56:01,290
You fucking dick!

1087
00:56:02,964 --> 00:56:04,853
No, no! God! Ow!

1088
00:56:06,044 --> 00:56:08,126
No! Shit!

1089
00:56:11,124 --> 00:56:12,535
Hey!

1090
00:56:12,804 --> 00:56:13,851
Hey!

1091
00:56:14,804 --> 00:56:15,805
Hey!

1092
00:56:31,724 --> 00:56:33,089
- Hey.
<i>- Hey, there.</i>

1093
00:56:33,204 --> 00:56:34,205
Got her.

1094
00:56:36,604 --> 00:56:37,651
See you in an hour?

1095
00:56:37,724 --> 00:56:39,169
<i>Yeah, why don't you bring
her to the Atlanta office?</i>

1096
00:56:39,324 --> 00:56:40,485
<i>It's right off the 75...</i>

1097
00:56:40,644 --> 00:56:42,806
Excuse me, sir.
Did you take my friend?

1098
00:56:43,004 --> 00:56:44,335
I gotta go. No.

1099
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:45,770
Come on, I saw you take her.

1100
00:56:45,964 --> 00:56:47,773
Well, then don't
ask me, shithead.

1101
00:56:48,844 --> 00:56:50,324
Sandy! Get me out
of this fucking van!

1102
00:56:50,444 --> 00:56:51,650
I got it.

1103
00:56:51,844 --> 00:56:53,414
Hey! Can you pull over, pal?
I need her.

1104
00:56:53,804 --> 00:56:55,408
Your girlfriend's
in a lot of trouble.

1105
00:56:55,564 --> 00:56:57,134
She's not my girlfriend.
Watch out.

1106
00:57:05,244 --> 00:57:06,814
Hey! You get back there!

1107
00:57:09,164 --> 00:57:10,370
Hey, buddy.

1108
00:57:10,524 --> 00:57:12,288
That's not Sandy Patterson.

1109
00:57:12,444 --> 00:57:13,934
Yes, it is.
No, you got the wrong guy.

1110
00:57:14,084 --> 00:57:15,688
It's me, I'm Sandy Patterson.

1111
00:57:15,844 --> 00:57:17,334
No, Sandy's a girl's name.

1112
00:57:17,484 --> 00:57:18,849
It's not, it's unisex!

1113
00:57:19,004 --> 00:57:20,449
What, like a hermaphrodite?

1114
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:22,049
Sandy!

1115
00:57:22,204 --> 00:57:23,285
Fuck you, tranny!

1116
00:57:23,444 --> 00:57:25,492
Get me out of this van.

1117
00:57:27,644 --> 00:57:28,645
Hey, hey, hey!

1118
00:57:31,884 --> 00:57:33,045
Shit.

1119
00:57:47,684 --> 00:57:50,733
Hey, hey, I got her first.
Pull over.

1120
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:52,932
You can't have her!
Shit!

1121
00:58:00,244 --> 00:58:01,689
Shit.

1122
00:58:03,724 --> 00:58:04,725
Motherfucker.

1123
00:58:30,284 --> 00:58:31,934
Listen, God damn it!

1124
00:58:32,084 --> 00:58:33,290
Ram him.
Do what?

1125
00:58:33,444 --> 00:58:35,048
Ram the quarter panel.

1126
00:58:35,244 --> 00:58:37,133
I don't have collision on this!

1127
00:58:37,324 --> 00:58:38,485
I don't give a shit!
Ram him!

1128
00:58:38,644 --> 00:58:39,645
I'm not doing it.

1129
00:58:43,604 --> 00:58:45,129
You son of a bitch.

1130
00:58:47,764 --> 00:58:48,970
Get in the back!
No!

1131
00:58:49,124 --> 00:58:51,286
Get off of me, you asshole!

1132
00:58:56,084 --> 00:58:57,085
Shit.

1133
00:58:57,164 --> 00:58:58,495
Did you punch him in the neck?

1134
00:58:58,684 --> 00:59:00,129
I can't get him off the wheel.

1135
00:59:00,284 --> 00:59:01,445
Pull over to the side.

1136
00:59:01,644 --> 00:59:03,931
I can't get him
off the wheel. Ram him.

1137
00:59:04,084 --> 00:59:05,654
I'm not comfortable with it!

1138
00:59:05,804 --> 00:59:07,533
I don't give a shit!
Ram that panel!

1139
00:59:14,084 --> 00:59:15,085
Shit.

1140
00:59:16,284 --> 00:59:18,969
Hit it harder,
you fucking vagina!

1141
01:00:02,244 --> 01:00:03,291
I'm going to be sick.

1142
01:00:03,364 --> 01:00:04,490
You Okay?

1143
01:00:05,524 --> 01:00:07,208
Are you all right?
You're bleeding.

1144
01:00:07,364 --> 01:00:08,525
Are you okay?
Oh, shit.

1145
01:00:08,684 --> 01:00:09,890
That was so violent.
Tell me you're all right.

1146
01:00:10,084 --> 01:00:11,085
I am all right. Yeah.

1147
01:00:11,244 --> 01:00:12,370
Okay. All right, okay.

1148
01:00:12,484 --> 01:00:13,485
Oh, God.

1149
01:00:13,684 --> 01:00:16,164
Okay. All right. This guy
does not look great.

1150
01:00:16,244 --> 01:00:17,245
Hey!

1151
01:00:17,604 --> 01:00:18,810
Oh, God.

1152
01:00:19,204 --> 01:00:20,535
Maybe he's just...

1153
01:00:20,724 --> 01:00:21,805
That doesn't look good.

1154
01:00:21,884 --> 01:00:24,046
I can't believe I did that.

1155
01:00:24,524 --> 01:00:28,529
You did it. You did it.
God, you did it too hard.

1156
01:00:28,604 --> 01:00:31,414
I tried a small one
on the first one.

1157
01:00:31,604 --> 01:00:32,765
And you said...
What did you call me?

1158
01:00:32,924 --> 01:00:34,892
I called you names, okay?

1159
01:00:35,724 --> 01:00:38,648
Your rental car doesn't
even have a scratch on it.

1160
01:00:39,204 --> 01:00:41,047
Yeah, that's great news.
The car is fine.

1161
01:00:41,244 --> 01:00:42,405
What's more important...

1162
01:00:54,004 --> 01:00:56,450
God. My glasses
were in there.

1163
01:01:07,244 --> 01:01:08,973
Well, you've come
to the right man.

1164
01:01:09,124 --> 01:01:11,775
Anybody looking to buy or
sell anything around here,

1165
01:01:11,924 --> 01:01:13,255
they come through me.

1166
01:01:13,444 --> 01:01:15,173
All right.
How much is this one?

1167
01:01:15,844 --> 01:01:17,528
That one is 350,000.

1168
01:01:17,684 --> 01:01:18,765
350?

1169
01:01:18,924 --> 01:01:22,292
I can get this for 100,000,
easy, at a short sale.

1170
01:01:22,444 --> 01:01:25,926
Well, I'm impressed. Clearly, you
both have done your research.

1171
01:01:26,084 --> 01:01:27,734
So, I'm also sure that you know

1172
01:01:27,804 --> 01:01:29,454
that this is
a traditional community.

1173
01:01:29,924 --> 01:01:31,926
What this means?
"Traditional"?

1174
01:01:32,124 --> 01:01:34,013
It means no homosexuals.

1175
01:01:34,164 --> 01:01:36,690
It means no foreigners.

1176
01:01:36,884 --> 01:01:38,693
It means no blacks.

1177
01:01:38,964 --> 01:01:40,614
We are two of those things.

1178
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:44,368
Hey, you two of these things.

1179
01:01:44,524 --> 01:01:47,528
I mean, around these parts,
you're basically black.

1180
01:01:48,164 --> 01:01:50,644
And a foreigner.
I'm just black.

1181
01:01:50,804 --> 01:01:52,454
Now, understand, me myself?

1182
01:01:52,644 --> 01:01:54,806
I am not a judgmental man.

1183
01:01:54,964 --> 01:01:57,968
But you should know that the
buyers and the sellers here,

1184
01:01:58,124 --> 01:01:59,410
their values are more...

1185
01:01:59,564 --> 01:02:00,565
Traditional.

1186
01:02:01,204 --> 01:02:02,330
Bingo, sister.

1187
01:02:02,404 --> 01:02:05,328
Traditional, like meeting
whores at hotel bars?

1188
01:02:08,084 --> 01:02:09,051
Who are you?

1189
01:02:09,164 --> 01:02:11,770
Your whore,
she's in a rental car.

1190
01:02:11,844 --> 01:02:14,734
We called up our friends in the
company, they look up the Lo-yack.

1191
01:02:15,004 --> 01:02:16,005
The what?

1192
01:02:16,084 --> 01:02:18,735
LoJack. Foreigners,
they can't say J's.

1193
01:02:19,004 --> 01:02:20,484
And they say it's at a hotel.

1194
01:02:20,524 --> 01:02:22,208
The people at the hotel
gave us a story

1195
01:02:22,364 --> 01:02:26,050
about you and another man and her,
all sexing together in a pile.

1196
01:02:26,724 --> 01:02:28,055
It's disgusting.

1197
01:02:28,204 --> 01:02:30,775
But to answer your question, the
Lo-yack is an excellent product.

1198
01:02:30,924 --> 01:02:32,574
It makes our work much easy.

1199
01:02:33,324 --> 01:02:34,325
What kind of work?

1200
01:02:35,524 --> 01:02:37,447
This our work.

1201
01:02:37,524 --> 01:02:38,605
Oh.

1202
01:02:38,684 --> 01:02:41,051
Very traditional.
Know what I'm saying, Chuck?

1203
01:02:41,204 --> 01:02:45,732
Now, who is she with,
and where is she going?

1204
01:02:46,164 --> 01:02:47,893
It's not a true allergy,

1205
01:02:48,044 --> 01:02:50,809
but there's definitely
a sensitivity.

1206
01:02:52,164 --> 01:02:53,495
I need that other roll of tape.

1207
01:02:53,644 --> 01:02:55,885
What are you doing?
Is he still... Tape?

1208
01:02:56,084 --> 01:02:58,371
I need the other roll of tape.

1209
01:02:58,524 --> 01:03:00,253
You're taping him?

1210
01:03:00,404 --> 01:03:03,135
Oh, Jesus, it's here.
Yes, I'm taping him.

1211
01:03:04,484 --> 01:03:06,691
No, no. Oh, no!

1212
01:03:06,804 --> 01:03:08,533
God damn it!

1213
01:03:11,804 --> 01:03:13,249
I told you it
was going to overheat.

1214
01:03:13,324 --> 01:03:14,804
I said you better
coast down the hill.

1215
01:03:14,884 --> 01:03:18,331
How am I supposed to propel down
the fucking highway in neutral?

1216
01:03:18,524 --> 01:03:20,014
I said I could show you.

1217
01:03:24,844 --> 01:03:28,735
I'm going to give you a juice.
It's fruit punch.

1218
01:03:30,404 --> 01:03:32,005
Yeah, that's nice and juicy.

1219
01:03:32,964 --> 01:03:35,171
These are nice,
I'll tell you that.

1220
01:03:35,324 --> 01:03:37,008
God, you keep yourself up.

1221
01:03:37,484 --> 01:03:39,134
That's just...

1222
01:03:39,204 --> 01:03:42,174
Oh, God, your beard
smells like sandwiches.

1223
01:03:42,244 --> 01:03:43,245
That's nice.

1224
01:03:54,964 --> 01:03:57,934
Okay, listen, the...

1225
01:03:58,004 --> 01:03:59,130
Say goodbye to
your art project.

1226
01:03:59,204 --> 01:04:00,444
The bus station's
down the road.

1227
01:04:00,484 --> 01:04:02,054
- We can walk it. Let's go.
- Coming.

1228
01:04:02,204 --> 01:04:03,774
Wherever you are,

1229
01:04:05,204 --> 01:04:08,413
you better believe I'm going
to find you, or die trying.

1230
01:04:09,644 --> 01:04:10,930
All right.

1231
01:04:11,084 --> 01:04:15,408
I get it, scary, survival,
end-of-days guy.

1232
01:04:15,564 --> 01:04:17,885
You should be nicer.
I gave you juice.

1233
01:04:28,204 --> 01:04:29,808
No, it was a van that crashed.

1234
01:04:29,964 --> 01:04:32,444
A couple of people
got in, drove away.

1235
01:04:32,604 --> 01:04:36,370
Kind of an average fella,
short gal, somewhat wide.

1236
01:04:36,524 --> 01:04:39,175
Took off north
on the 520 right there.

1237
01:04:43,844 --> 01:04:46,575
Yeah, I'm fine. We're
still on course, honey.

1238
01:04:47,604 --> 01:04:50,050
I don't know. Where Yoda lives.

1239
01:04:50,244 --> 01:04:52,611
"These are not the droids
you're looking for."

1240
01:04:52,684 --> 01:04:53,765
Remember...
Tell her that.

1241
01:04:55,204 --> 01:04:57,571
I know it. Honey, you're
breaking up a little bit.

1242
01:04:58,204 --> 01:04:59,933
Honey? Hello?

1243
01:05:00,564 --> 01:05:01,725
Shit.

1244
01:05:01,884 --> 01:05:03,773
How's everything going at home?

1245
01:05:03,964 --> 01:05:05,534
I don't know.
We didn't get that far.

1246
01:05:05,684 --> 01:05:07,686
Because I'm out here.

1247
01:05:08,204 --> 01:05:13,210
I guess I should thank you
for saving me back there.

1248
01:05:13,564 --> 01:05:14,565
You're a good friend.

1249
01:05:14,684 --> 01:05:15,731
I'm not your friend.

1250
01:05:15,804 --> 01:05:17,966
I am not your friend,
we're not hanging out.

1251
01:05:18,044 --> 01:05:21,253
I heard you yell to that guy,
"Did you take my friend?"

1252
01:05:21,404 --> 01:05:23,930
Yeah, that's a saying. You haven't
heard that saying before?

1253
01:05:24,084 --> 01:05:26,405
Besides, friends don't steal
friends' identities, do they?

1254
01:05:28,044 --> 01:05:29,205
You're diabolical.

1255
01:05:29,404 --> 01:05:30,690
Well, thanks.

1256
01:05:30,844 --> 01:05:32,044
That's not a compliment.

1257
01:05:32,084 --> 01:05:33,245
I know.

1258
01:05:35,084 --> 01:05:37,769
Here we go.
Here we go.

1259
01:05:38,284 --> 01:05:39,968
Aw, come on!

1260
01:05:40,284 --> 01:05:41,285
You're doing great.

1261
01:05:41,444 --> 01:05:43,245
You are going to have to
hide on the next one.

1262
01:05:43,284 --> 01:05:44,615
It's clearly you.

1263
01:05:44,764 --> 01:05:45,970
Oh, it's me.

1264
01:05:46,124 --> 01:05:49,333
I have never been passed up
when I got this thing out.

1265
01:05:49,404 --> 01:05:51,764
I don't doubt that you do
real well on the side of the road.

1266
01:05:51,804 --> 01:05:53,135
But I don't know why
you're not trusting this.

1267
01:05:53,284 --> 01:05:54,285
Stop for one second.

1268
01:05:54,364 --> 01:05:56,810
It is only two miles
straight through there.

1269
01:05:56,884 --> 01:05:58,693
Two miles through the woods?

1270
01:05:59,484 --> 01:06:01,452
Yeah. Are you allergic
to woods or something?

1271
01:06:01,644 --> 01:06:03,408
Come on, you want to go
10 more miles on this road?

1272
01:06:03,604 --> 01:06:04,605
Get some more blisters?

1273
01:06:04,764 --> 01:06:06,846
Come on, that's a shortcut.

1274
01:06:09,404 --> 01:06:11,691
Yes? There's a yes. Finally.

1275
01:06:12,484 --> 01:06:14,373
I knew you were probably wrong.

1276
01:06:14,524 --> 01:06:15,885
I knew your phone
was going to die.

1277
01:06:16,124 --> 01:06:17,364
I should've said something.

1278
01:06:17,524 --> 01:06:19,686
You knew it. What are you?
You're like a psychic, huh?

1279
01:06:19,844 --> 01:06:21,653
Well, you know what? I am.

1280
01:06:21,844 --> 01:06:23,364
I'm not going to
get into it, but I am.

1281
01:06:23,404 --> 01:06:26,055
Really? On top of everything
else, you're a psychic.

1282
01:06:26,204 --> 01:06:27,854
That's amazing.

1283
01:06:28,044 --> 01:06:29,694
Pick a number between 1 and 10.

1284
01:06:33,164 --> 01:06:34,529
Four.
Four.

1285
01:06:37,204 --> 01:06:38,535
I know, it was a gift.

1286
01:06:38,724 --> 01:06:41,091
Your gifts abound.
That's amazing.

1287
01:06:41,244 --> 01:06:42,928
I think so, too.

1288
01:06:43,484 --> 01:06:46,169
Then why don't you rest
your talents, Megamind.

1289
01:06:46,324 --> 01:06:47,974
The sun is going to
be up in a few hours,

1290
01:06:48,044 --> 01:06:50,172
and we'll take it
the rest of the way.

1291
01:06:54,724 --> 01:06:56,567
Hey, hey, hey. Spread out.

1292
01:06:56,724 --> 01:06:58,453
You've got the whole forest,
what are you doing?

1293
01:06:58,604 --> 01:07:00,845
It's cold. This is what
they do on Survivor.

1294
01:07:01,004 --> 01:07:03,371
When they want to get punched?
Get off of me.

1295
01:07:07,524 --> 01:07:09,288
Do you usually listen to music

1296
01:07:10,404 --> 01:07:11,530
before you go to bed?

1297
01:07:11,684 --> 01:07:13,971
No, just a lot of silence.

1298
01:07:17,524 --> 01:07:18,810
Oh, my God.

1299
01:07:23,844 --> 01:07:26,324
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1300
01:07:27,524 --> 01:07:28,810
You're like a four-year-old.

1301
01:07:30,684 --> 01:07:34,245
You know, this light is very
flattering on your chin.

1302
01:07:37,764 --> 01:07:39,653
Oh, my God. Diana.

1303
01:07:39,804 --> 01:07:42,330
I'm serious, get your hand off. Please,
I don't want to play footsies.

1304
01:07:42,484 --> 01:07:43,610
I'm not doing anything.

1305
01:07:43,844 --> 01:07:46,848
Snake! Snake! Snake!
Oh, my God!

1306
01:07:47,044 --> 01:07:48,045
Shit.

1307
01:07:48,204 --> 01:07:49,808
Get away from me!

1308
01:07:52,484 --> 01:07:53,485
Throw him! Throw him!

1309
01:07:57,804 --> 01:07:59,044
Oh, God, it was so close to me.

1310
01:08:00,324 --> 01:08:01,894
Thanks for the help.
You're welcome.

1311
01:08:02,044 --> 01:08:03,375
This is no longer
our sleeping spot.

1312
01:08:03,444 --> 01:08:04,730
There's probably
a fucking ton of them.

1313
01:08:04,884 --> 01:08:06,807
They're not
pack animals, Sandy.

1314
01:08:06,964 --> 01:08:08,728
I know they're not
pack animals, okay?

1315
01:08:08,884 --> 01:08:10,485
But have you ever heard of a snake nest?

1316
01:08:10,524 --> 01:08:11,685
Oh, shit.

1317
01:08:11,844 --> 01:08:14,005
Just the mere thought of that
is going to keep me up...

1318
01:08:14,364 --> 01:08:15,570
Oh, God.

1319
01:08:15,844 --> 01:08:16,845
Don't move.

1320
01:08:17,004 --> 01:08:18,369
Not a problem.
I'm not moving.

1321
01:08:18,524 --> 01:08:20,174
Shit, it's huge!

1322
01:08:20,364 --> 01:08:21,854
No shit. Get him off me.

1323
01:08:22,004 --> 01:08:24,211
Okay. I got it.

1324
01:08:25,004 --> 01:08:26,204
What's the plan with the fire?

1325
01:08:26,244 --> 01:08:27,370
What are you
doing with the fire?

1326
01:08:27,444 --> 01:08:28,491
Get away from me
with that thing.

1327
01:08:28,564 --> 01:08:30,726
I saw it on a television show.
Snakes hate fire.

1328
01:08:30,804 --> 01:08:33,205
Unless that was about spiders.
I don't know.

1329
01:08:33,364 --> 01:08:35,014
You're going to burn me, and
you're going to piss him off.

1330
01:08:35,084 --> 01:08:37,530
Get away from me.
Be quiet and stay still.

1331
01:08:37,604 --> 01:08:38,884
Get away from me
with that thing.

1332
01:08:39,484 --> 01:08:41,054
Oh, God!

1333
01:08:41,604 --> 01:08:42,730
That's not helping.

1334
01:08:42,884 --> 01:08:45,251
It just keeps looking at me.

1335
01:08:46,004 --> 01:08:47,051
Oh, he's tightening.

1336
01:08:50,244 --> 01:08:51,894
Turn your face away.

1337
01:08:51,964 --> 01:08:53,011
Okay.

1338
01:08:53,084 --> 01:08:55,212
It's almost over.

1339
01:08:58,404 --> 01:08:59,894
Trouble.
He's got the neck.

1340
01:09:05,524 --> 01:09:07,014
God! Don't let it
come near me.

1341
01:09:07,124 --> 01:09:08,171
That hurts!

1342
01:09:09,884 --> 01:09:12,251
That hurt. That hurts!

1343
01:09:12,404 --> 01:09:13,565
Oh, God.

1344
01:09:32,404 --> 01:09:33,405
Okay.

1345
01:09:33,524 --> 01:09:35,572
Okay. Go slow, fella.

1346
01:09:35,724 --> 01:09:38,455
Just go slow. Easy.

1347
01:09:40,804 --> 01:09:42,294
Where are we?
What is this?

1348
01:09:42,444 --> 01:09:44,924
Bus station, middle of nowhere.

1349
01:09:45,924 --> 01:09:47,005
Whose pants are these?

1350
01:09:47,204 --> 01:09:48,808
I got them out of
the lost and found.

1351
01:09:49,644 --> 01:09:50,770
It's a good fit, huh?

1352
01:09:51,044 --> 01:09:53,331
Yeah. Okay.
Better get on a bus.

1353
01:09:54,164 --> 01:09:57,964
We're not getting on any bus
for three days, not to Denver.

1354
01:09:58,044 --> 01:09:59,045
What?

1355
01:09:59,124 --> 01:10:01,491
There's not a bus from here
to Denver for three days.

1356
01:10:02,444 --> 01:10:04,970
Hey. When's
the next bus to Denver?

1357
01:10:05,964 --> 01:10:07,170
Wednesday.

1358
01:10:09,444 --> 01:10:11,970
Fuck! That's too late.

1359
01:10:17,164 --> 01:10:20,850
Phone's gone, wallet's gone
because the pants are gone.

1360
01:10:30,804 --> 01:10:32,374
We're done. I'm done.

1361
01:10:34,484 --> 01:10:37,328
I lose, you win.
You're a great thief.

1362
01:10:38,364 --> 01:10:40,173
I got nothing left.

1363
01:10:42,324 --> 01:10:46,568
I got no money, I got no time,
I got no job, I got no chance.

1364
01:10:53,004 --> 01:10:57,009
I've got these weird pants on,
out in the middle of nowhere.

1365
01:11:00,164 --> 01:11:01,609
How did we get here anyway?

1366
01:11:03,004 --> 01:11:04,449
I carried you.

1367
01:11:04,524 --> 01:11:05,525
You what?

1368
01:11:06,524 --> 01:11:08,765
I carried you.
It's not a big deal.

1369
01:11:09,244 --> 01:11:11,451
You were unconscious.

1370
01:11:11,604 --> 01:11:13,015
We were like, a half mile
from the main road.

1371
01:11:13,204 --> 01:11:14,251
Jesus Christ.

1372
01:11:14,324 --> 01:11:17,294
So, I just I scooped you up
and flagged down a truck

1373
01:11:17,524 --> 01:11:20,095
and he gave us a ride here,
dropped us off.

1374
01:11:21,724 --> 01:11:24,250
You carried me a half mile.
That's, uh...

1375
01:11:24,404 --> 01:11:27,169
Probably not even that far.

1376
01:11:27,244 --> 01:11:29,770
You get these shoes the same
place you got the pants?

1377
01:11:29,924 --> 01:11:32,370
No. Yeah.

1378
01:11:33,044 --> 01:11:35,164
The clerk said an EMT took
them off a dead hobo, so...

1379
01:11:35,724 --> 01:11:36,771
Come on.

1380
01:11:36,844 --> 01:11:38,084
He's not going
to need them back, so...

1381
01:11:38,364 --> 01:11:40,207
A guy died in these?

1382
01:11:40,364 --> 01:11:41,411
Because you needed shoes.

1383
01:11:41,524 --> 01:11:42,935
What is the matter with you?

1384
01:11:45,044 --> 01:11:46,648
My socks, though...

1385
01:11:46,804 --> 01:11:48,249
They're your socks,
they're not dead guy socks.

1386
01:11:48,404 --> 01:11:50,645
I've got money in here. I've got money.
I got sock money.

1387
01:11:50,724 --> 01:11:51,725
We don't have...

1388
01:11:52,884 --> 01:11:54,454
What the hell?
Hey.

1389
01:11:54,604 --> 01:11:57,289
Why are we living like animals if
you've got money in your socks?

1390
01:11:57,484 --> 01:11:59,725
I've got $300 and I need to
be in Denver by Tuesday.

1391
01:12:00,289 --> 01:12:02,656
You can get a pretty cheap car
over there at Andrew's.

1392
01:12:02,809 --> 01:12:04,698
Tell him Carl sent you.
He's a good man, Andrew.

1393
01:12:04,849 --> 01:12:06,135
He was with my
sister for a bit.

1394
01:12:06,249 --> 01:12:07,296
Oh, yeah?

1395
01:12:08,329 --> 01:12:11,811
You got a beautiful yard here, Andrew.
Here's 200 of the finest.

1396
01:12:11,969 --> 01:12:13,414
Keys? Thank you.

1397
01:12:13,649 --> 01:12:15,936
Ooh! And it's got satellite.

1398
01:12:16,129 --> 01:12:19,338
I'm glad we're not
buying that one. Jesus.

1399
01:12:42,569 --> 01:12:44,059
Morning.

1400
01:12:44,889 --> 01:12:46,015
Morning.

1401
01:12:46,529 --> 01:12:49,453
I'm supposed to be
meeting some friends here.

1402
01:12:49,609 --> 01:12:52,453
Was there a man and a lady
come through here?

1403
01:12:52,609 --> 01:12:54,373
Both answer to the name Sandy.

1404
01:12:55,369 --> 01:12:56,416
Well,

1405
01:12:56,489 --> 01:12:58,218
we get tons of
people through here.

1406
01:13:04,289 --> 01:13:05,973
Ahhh!
I've had a shitty day

1407
01:13:06,049 --> 01:13:09,053
and you got a face that
looks like a dog's asshole.

1408
01:13:09,209 --> 01:13:10,290
Were they here or not?

1409
01:13:10,369 --> 01:13:12,770
They came through earlier.
I sent them to get a car.

1410
01:13:12,889 --> 01:13:13,936
Where?

1411
01:13:14,009 --> 01:13:15,340
Andrew's Auto Salvage.

1412
01:13:15,569 --> 01:13:16,775
Write it down.

1413
01:13:24,849 --> 01:13:26,419
I wasn't here.

1414
01:13:35,809 --> 01:13:36,970
Thank you.

1415
01:13:37,309 --> 01:13:40,518
Consider that a warning.
We need her more than you do.

1416
01:13:40,909 --> 01:13:42,593
Better luck next time, old man.

1417
01:13:42,749 --> 01:13:44,035
Fuck you.

1418
01:13:45,469 --> 01:13:46,709
Shh!

1419
01:14:00,909 --> 01:14:02,479
That's what I always
thought, but then I thought,

1420
01:14:02,629 --> 01:14:03,835
"You know what?
I'm going to do it."

1421
01:14:03,909 --> 01:14:05,718
"I'm going to wallpaper the
garage." And I found...

1422
01:14:05,789 --> 01:14:07,917
First I thought, "Well, is
that going to be crazy?"

1423
01:14:08,029 --> 01:14:09,440
But it's not really that crazy,

1424
01:14:09,509 --> 01:14:11,352
because I found something
kind of thematically on point.

1425
01:14:11,509 --> 01:14:13,591
You wouldn't rather just listen to this?
That's a good song.

1426
01:14:13,749 --> 01:14:17,037
Oh, it is a good song. I like that.
It's got tires on it.

1427
01:14:17,189 --> 01:14:20,193
It's wallpaper with tires,
which I thought was...

1428
01:14:20,269 --> 01:14:21,270
Ow!

1429
01:14:21,349 --> 01:14:22,999
You okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.

1430
01:14:23,149 --> 01:14:26,198
I think it would be so cute.
It's red and...

1431
01:14:26,589 --> 01:14:28,034
God damn it!

1432
01:14:28,189 --> 01:14:30,078
It was one of those badgers. Oh.

1433
01:14:51,789 --> 01:14:53,951
How great is the ride
on this Caprice, huh?

1434
01:14:54,189 --> 01:14:55,873
You know this is
the last tank, right?

1435
01:14:55,949 --> 01:14:57,553
This is not going
to get us to Denver.

1436
01:14:57,869 --> 01:14:59,553
You know, I could help us out.

1437
01:15:00,749 --> 01:15:02,274
How? Did you find
some sock money?

1438
01:15:02,469 --> 01:15:05,996
No, I didn't find sock money. But
I've got my credit card burner.

1439
01:15:06,149 --> 01:15:08,311
I can get a card, fill this
tank up in 15 minutes.

1440
01:15:08,469 --> 01:15:11,120
I told you, this trip
will not turn me into you.

1441
01:15:11,269 --> 01:15:13,271
I am not saying
that we have to go out

1442
01:15:13,349 --> 01:15:15,272
and steal from orphans
and baby puppies.

1443
01:15:15,469 --> 01:15:16,994
No one deserves
to get stolen from.

1444
01:15:17,149 --> 01:15:18,913
I don't know why you don't get that.
Just drop it.

1445
01:15:19,369 --> 01:15:21,451
I get it,
I just find it bizarre

1446
01:15:21,569 --> 01:15:23,617
that you don't have
any kind of shit list.

1447
01:15:23,689 --> 01:15:24,850
I find it pretty
hard to believe

1448
01:15:24,929 --> 01:15:26,010
that you can't come
up with one person

1449
01:15:26,209 --> 01:15:29,133
that deserves the wrath
of Sandy Patterson.

1450
01:15:34,009 --> 01:15:35,499
My old boss, Harold Cornish,

1451
01:15:35,649 --> 01:15:38,619
is a partner here at this
major financial institution.

1452
01:15:38,689 --> 01:15:41,009
They have got a branch here in St.
Louis. Here is the plan.

1453
01:15:41,369 --> 01:15:43,889
<i>We're gonna go inside, we're gonna
get his financial information</i>

1454
01:15:43,929 --> 01:15:45,613
<i>for your little
credit card toy.</i>

1455
01:15:45,769 --> 01:15:47,817
<i>Social Security numbers, bank
account numbers, routing numbers,</i>

1456
01:15:48,009 --> 01:15:50,455
<i>it's all stored on hard copies
in there, in the Record</i> Room.

1457
01:15:50,609 --> 01:15:51,974
<i>We just need a little
code to get in there.</i>

1458
01:15:52,129 --> 01:15:54,211
<i>Yeah, but we can't get in
there with you looking like that.</i>

1459
01:15:54,369 --> 01:15:56,940
<i>That's a great point.
There is a way around that.</i>

1460
01:15:57,049 --> 01:15:59,211
Oh!

1461
01:15:59,889 --> 01:16:01,050
Are you okay?

1462
01:16:01,889 --> 01:16:02,890
What is it? What is it?

1463
01:16:03,009 --> 01:16:05,580
My fibromyalgia. Oh, God,
my leg is cramping up.

1464
01:16:05,649 --> 01:16:06,980
What can I do? What can I do?
Oh, God. Rub it.

1465
01:16:07,129 --> 01:16:08,210
Rub it?
Rub it! Rub it!

1466
01:16:08,289 --> 01:16:09,415
Rub it! It's cramping.

1467
01:16:11,129 --> 01:16:12,130
Oh!

1468
01:16:12,969 --> 01:16:13,970
Up?

1469
01:16:14,049 --> 01:16:16,290
Higher, higher, higher.

1470
01:16:16,409 --> 01:16:17,490
Higher.
A little higher.

1471
01:16:17,569 --> 01:16:18,730
Oh, God, it's in my glutes.

1472
01:16:23,969 --> 01:16:25,095
Get in there!

1473
01:16:25,249 --> 01:16:26,489
How is this helping you?

1474
01:16:26,649 --> 01:16:29,300
On, God!

1475
01:16:33,729 --> 01:16:35,618
God, get in there!
All right, get off me.

1476
01:16:35,689 --> 01:16:36,736
Get off me.

1477
01:16:46,529 --> 01:16:48,770
I thought it was gonna
be a couple of offices.

1478
01:16:48,929 --> 01:16:50,454
No. Come on.

1479
01:16:52,449 --> 01:16:53,530
Who is this guy?

1480
01:16:53,929 --> 01:16:57,456
That's Accounts Processing. That's
the "me" of this branch. Come on.

1481
01:16:57,609 --> 01:16:58,940
Oh. That shouldn't
be any problem.

1482
01:16:59,089 --> 01:17:00,729
No offense, but just
keep your mouth shut.

1483
01:17:00,849 --> 01:17:02,772
This will be over in a minute.

1484
01:17:02,929 --> 01:17:05,580
Hi. Good morning.

1485
01:17:05,729 --> 01:17:10,132
Tina... Van Westengarden.
How are you?

1486
01:17:11,289 --> 01:17:13,417
I'm fine. Can I help you?

1487
01:17:13,609 --> 01:17:17,136
I'm here with my boss, Harold Cornish.
We're in from Denver.

1488
01:17:17,289 --> 01:17:18,859
Oh. I'm familiar
with the name.

1489
01:17:19,009 --> 01:17:20,249
I'm sure you are.

1490
01:17:20,409 --> 01:17:22,289
We're gonna need to get
into your Accounts Room.

1491
01:17:22,889 --> 01:17:24,289
Do you have
an authorization letter?

1492
01:17:31,009 --> 01:17:33,091
I'm gonna be
real honest with you.

1493
01:17:33,249 --> 01:17:34,580
I fucked up.

1494
01:17:35,209 --> 01:17:39,294
I just kind of completely blanked
on that authorization letter.

1495
01:17:39,449 --> 01:17:42,453
He basically runs me 24-7.
He's...

1496
01:17:42,609 --> 01:17:45,260
Cornish is... He's a handful.
I mean...

1497
01:17:45,409 --> 01:17:47,298
Honestly, he's an asshole.

1498
01:17:47,650 --> 01:17:48,731
Just a sec.

1499
01:17:49,958 --> 01:17:51,079
How are we doing over there?

1500
01:17:51,278 --> 01:17:52,848
We doing good?
You calling security?

1501
01:17:52,998 --> 01:17:55,285
You better not be calling security.
Hang up the phone right now.

1502
01:17:55,478 --> 01:17:56,525
I wasn't calling security.

1503
01:17:56,638 --> 01:17:58,003
Yes, you were. Hang it up.

1504
01:17:58,238 --> 01:17:59,683
Right now.

1505
01:18:00,678 --> 01:18:03,319
I'm sorry, but you're not allowed
back there without authorization.

1506
01:18:03,758 --> 01:18:05,328
I'm not... You're not allowed
back there without authorization.

1507
01:18:05,478 --> 01:18:06,799
I can do whatever
the hell I want.

1508
01:18:07,278 --> 01:18:09,440
I don't have to tell
you that we suspect

1509
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:11,008
that there are some
people at this branch

1510
01:18:11,078 --> 01:18:12,718
that are doing some
very, very bad things.

1511
01:18:12,798 --> 01:18:14,368
And I don't have to tell you
that I've been sent here

1512
01:18:14,438 --> 01:18:17,638
to look very quietly
at some records.

1513
01:18:17,638 --> 01:18:21,643
Mr. Cornish, I don't mean any
offense, but we have rules.

1514
01:18:21,798 --> 01:18:23,448
I know you have rules.

1515
01:18:23,598 --> 01:18:25,168
Like never backdate a 5590

1516
01:18:25,278 --> 01:18:29,408
or don't stamp a 33-B transfer
without telling a client first.

1517
01:18:29,758 --> 01:18:31,886
I bet you do that one
twice a month, don't you?

1518
01:18:33,158 --> 01:18:35,001
Tanya, can you give
us a minute, please?

1519
01:18:35,158 --> 01:18:37,320
It's Tina, but...

1520
01:18:37,478 --> 01:18:39,003
See what I mean?
What did I say?

1521
01:18:39,198 --> 01:18:40,438
Nothing. You said that.

1522
01:18:41,718 --> 01:18:43,482
I have you at a disadvantage.

1523
01:18:43,598 --> 01:18:45,965
You don't know me,
but I know you, Ken.

1524
01:18:46,118 --> 01:18:49,964
I know that you
make $49,395 a year.

1525
01:18:51,038 --> 01:18:54,008
I know that you work very hard for
that wife and child right there.

1526
01:18:54,358 --> 01:18:55,959
I know that you're
real good at your job,

1527
01:18:55,998 --> 01:18:57,523
that you take care
of this company

1528
01:18:57,598 --> 01:19:00,249
and you do things that
they'll never know about,

1529
01:19:00,318 --> 01:19:01,524
that they'll never appreciate.

1530
01:19:01,598 --> 01:19:03,407
So, you're very proud, right?

1531
01:19:04,078 --> 01:19:05,318
But you're scared.

1532
01:19:05,758 --> 01:19:07,886
You're scared because
you're dispensable.

1533
01:19:08,038 --> 01:19:11,406
You're scared because you know
that, more than likely, one day,

1534
01:19:11,558 --> 01:19:14,926
you're gonna be replaced by
somebody younger, somebody cheaper,

1535
01:19:15,118 --> 01:19:16,165
maybe even by an app.

1536
01:19:17,286 --> 01:19:18,617
Here's what we can do, though.

1537
01:19:18,806 --> 01:19:22,208
You can help me today and someday
I might be able to help you.

1538
01:19:25,113 --> 01:19:26,194
9488.

1539
01:19:46,353 --> 01:19:47,684
Got it.

1540
01:19:54,473 --> 01:19:55,804
Let me see it.

1541
01:19:55,993 --> 01:19:57,677
This is it. Right there.

1542
01:19:59,273 --> 01:20:00,399
We got it.

1543
01:20:00,473 --> 01:20:01,884
All right. That's what I need.

1544
01:20:17,433 --> 01:20:19,003
Shit.

1545
01:20:25,553 --> 01:20:26,884
Got it.

1546
01:20:28,193 --> 01:20:29,797
Got it.
Wow.

1547
01:20:46,713 --> 01:20:48,078
Okay, great. Good job.

1548
01:20:48,233 --> 01:20:50,679
Let's put this baby to use, get some
gasoline and hit the road again.

1549
01:20:50,873 --> 01:20:53,240
Wait, wait, wait.
Hit the road? No, no.

1550
01:20:53,393 --> 01:20:56,715
I am exhausted. I need to sleep
for at least a couple of hours.

1551
01:20:56,873 --> 01:20:59,240
I need something to eat
that doesn't come out of a bag

1552
01:20:59,473 --> 01:21:02,238
and I need to put at least some
of my parts into a shower.

1553
01:21:02,613 --> 01:21:03,614
I bet you're a real mess.

1554
01:21:04,053 --> 01:21:05,543
Do we get you
a Motel 6, or something?

1555
01:21:06,293 --> 01:21:08,899
Motel 6? No, no, no.

1556
01:21:09,653 --> 01:21:11,655
Mr. Cornish, we go
wherever we want.

1557
01:21:13,333 --> 01:21:15,495
Come on. Let's go.

1558
01:21:23,733 --> 01:21:24,814
I need a room, please.

1559
01:21:24,893 --> 01:21:25,974
How about a suite?

1560
01:21:26,053 --> 01:21:28,055
Thank you, Mr. Cornish.

1561
01:21:28,253 --> 01:21:29,379
Yes, hello.

1562
01:21:43,093 --> 01:21:46,017
God, they're real. They're real.
Yeah.

1563
01:22:13,293 --> 01:22:15,944
Just get there!
Get there! Get there!

1564
01:22:20,453 --> 01:22:21,614
I miss you.

1565
01:22:21,693 --> 01:22:23,263
<i>I miss you, too, sweetheart.</i>

1566
01:22:23,453 --> 01:22:25,535
We're just gonna
rest for a little bit,

1567
01:22:25,613 --> 01:22:27,695
and then one last
haul to get home.

1568
01:22:27,893 --> 01:22:28,940
<i>Thank God.</i>

1569
01:22:29,093 --> 01:22:30,060
Have you talked to Daniel?

1570
01:22:30,133 --> 01:22:32,818
Yeah, spoke to Daniel.
Everything's gonna be fine.

1571
01:22:33,133 --> 01:22:35,659
Oh! This place has
a shopping arcade.

1572
01:22:36,133 --> 01:22:37,942
Reservation's at 8:00, okay?

1573
01:22:38,093 --> 01:22:39,299
And no jewelry.

1574
01:22:39,613 --> 01:22:41,138
I'll get cash for tips.

1575
01:22:41,333 --> 01:22:43,381
<i>Is that her?</i>
Yeah, that's her.

1576
01:22:43,693 --> 01:22:45,457
Okay. Drive safely, will you?

1577
01:22:45,613 --> 01:22:47,581
Okay. I'll see you soon.

1578
01:22:52,881 --> 01:22:54,883
Oh, that's a nice match.

1579
01:22:55,041 --> 01:22:56,930
Now, that is a nice match.

1580
01:23:04,721 --> 01:23:06,166
Oh, that's nice.

1581
01:23:09,321 --> 01:23:12,165
No, dear. More is not more.

1582
01:23:15,401 --> 01:23:17,324
Oh, that's better. Okay.

1583
01:23:19,001 --> 01:23:20,127
She is the best.

1584
01:23:44,681 --> 01:23:45,842
Um...

1585
01:23:46,201 --> 01:23:49,045
Maybe you could help me.

1586
01:23:50,521 --> 01:23:52,285
Oh, honey.

1587
01:23:53,281 --> 01:23:54,407
We'll take care of you.

1588
01:23:54,481 --> 01:23:56,623
I've done a lot of
the groundwork for you.

1589
01:23:56,623 --> 01:23:57,289
Really!

1590
01:23:57,289 --> 01:23:58,814
It's really more
of a touch-up.

1591
01:24:01,609 --> 01:24:03,134
Okay.

1592
01:24:27,689 --> 01:24:28,850
Diana.

1593
01:24:29,809 --> 01:24:30,890
What?

1594
01:24:31,049 --> 01:24:32,210
You look beautiful.

1595
01:24:33,009 --> 01:24:34,010
It's just all...

1596
01:24:34,809 --> 01:24:36,891
It's all tricks and stuff.

1597
01:24:37,809 --> 01:24:40,210
Not tricks, that's you.

1598
01:24:42,249 --> 01:24:43,375
I said no jewelry.

1599
01:24:44,209 --> 01:24:45,335
Oh, God, were you serious?

1600
01:24:45,409 --> 01:24:46,456
Yeah.

1601
01:24:46,649 --> 01:24:48,413
Oh, God. You've gotta
work on your tone.

1602
01:24:48,609 --> 01:24:50,418
It was my tone?
It's vague.

1603
01:24:52,369 --> 01:24:54,736
It's not just the top, it's
the Lucite, too.

1604
01:24:54,929 --> 01:24:55,976
This is great.

1605
01:24:56,129 --> 01:24:58,291
I'd like to make a toast.
To you. Oh.

1606
01:24:58,449 --> 01:25:00,372
I thought I was the enemy.

1607
01:25:02,249 --> 01:25:05,219
You are, but I gotta admit,
you taught me something.

1608
01:25:05,929 --> 01:25:07,770
Well, you taught me a few things.
You taught me

1609
01:25:08,129 --> 01:25:12,293
about getting what you want, and
you taught me about confidence.

1610
01:25:12,489 --> 01:25:14,298
Maybe a little bit too much
about confidence.

1611
01:25:14,489 --> 01:25:16,571
Did you see me with that
poor Ken Talbott today?

1612
01:25:16,729 --> 01:25:18,094
Yeah, you were
pretty hard on him.

1613
01:25:18,169 --> 01:25:19,170
I know.

1614
01:25:19,929 --> 01:25:21,419
But people have been hard
on me my whole life,

1615
01:25:21,569 --> 01:25:23,059
and I just don't want to feel
like the chump anymore.

1616
01:25:23,249 --> 01:25:24,580
And you showed me that.

1617
01:25:24,729 --> 01:25:26,094
Did I?
Yeah.

1618
01:25:26,249 --> 01:25:28,729
You also completely
messed up my life,

1619
01:25:28,809 --> 01:25:30,174
but I guess it needed
a little messing up,

1620
01:25:30,249 --> 01:25:31,689
needed a little bit
more Diana in it.

1621
01:25:31,809 --> 01:25:32,935
Well.

1622
01:25:33,089 --> 01:25:34,295
Or whatever your real name is.

1623
01:25:35,609 --> 01:25:36,610
That is my real name.

1624
01:25:36,689 --> 01:25:37,690
That's not. Come on.

1625
01:25:37,929 --> 01:25:39,090
It is.
We're friends now.

1626
01:25:39,169 --> 01:25:40,500
That's my name, I don't
know what to tell you.

1627
01:25:40,569 --> 01:25:43,254
Will you tell me your real name?
Finally, please?

1628
01:25:44,529 --> 01:25:45,530
What does it matter?

1629
01:25:45,649 --> 01:25:46,855
Exactly. What does it matter?

1630
01:25:46,929 --> 01:25:48,135
Fine, it's Marla.

1631
01:25:48,249 --> 01:25:49,933
Why are you lying to me?
Just tell me your name.

1632
01:25:50,089 --> 01:25:51,056
I don't wanna tell you.

1633
01:25:51,169 --> 01:25:52,694
Don't get pissed off. I'm
not getting pissed off.

1634
01:25:52,769 --> 01:25:54,100
Just drop it.

1635
01:25:54,249 --> 01:25:56,172
This is weird. Why won't
you tell me your name?

1636
01:25:56,369 --> 01:25:57,416
It can't be worse than Sandy.

1637
01:25:57,489 --> 01:25:58,615
Because I don't know it.

1638
01:25:58,769 --> 01:26:00,771
Come on.
I don't know it.

1639
01:26:01,169 --> 01:26:02,170
You don't know it.

1640
01:26:02,289 --> 01:26:03,620
I don't know it.

1641
01:26:04,609 --> 01:26:05,849
Really?

1642
01:26:06,449 --> 01:26:09,658
What about your family? What
about Morganville, Wisconsin?

1643
01:26:09,769 --> 01:26:11,370
Are you telling me
that was all bullshit?

1644
01:26:11,609 --> 01:26:15,170
No. There's
a great little town.

1645
01:26:15,329 --> 01:26:17,331
It's Morganville,
it's in Wisconsin.

1646
01:26:17,489 --> 01:26:21,255
And there's a really nice little
police station in the center of town

1647
01:26:21,329 --> 01:26:24,458
where people that don't want
their babies can leave them.

1648
01:26:26,169 --> 01:26:27,614
So, what name is
it that you want?

1649
01:26:27,689 --> 01:26:30,209
Because I had six of them by the
time I was through foster care.

1650
01:26:31,409 --> 01:26:32,615
That's a...

1651
01:26:32,689 --> 01:26:36,819
That's a tough
life road to go...

1652
01:26:36,969 --> 01:26:40,337
I mean, no one who could have
helped you out maybe, early on,

1653
01:26:40,489 --> 01:26:41,810
and put you down
a different path?

1654
01:26:41,969 --> 01:26:42,970
No.

1655
01:26:43,689 --> 01:26:46,340
No, there's been no one, ever,

1656
01:26:47,329 --> 01:26:49,491
to put me down
a different path.

1657
01:26:50,489 --> 01:26:51,650
To do anything for me.

1658
01:26:51,729 --> 01:26:54,414
There's never been anybody.
It's just been me.

1659
01:26:55,409 --> 01:26:57,730
So, I don't give
a shit about people,

1660
01:26:57,809 --> 01:26:59,857
and people don't give a shit about me.
And that's just how it is.

1661
01:27:00,009 --> 01:27:01,170
I give a shit about you.

1662
01:27:01,249 --> 01:27:03,172
You don't give a shit about me.

1663
01:27:03,649 --> 01:27:05,253
You just want me
to clean up my mess.

1664
01:27:05,329 --> 01:27:06,854
You don't give a shit about me.

1665
01:27:07,009 --> 01:27:08,340
And I know it.

1666
01:27:09,409 --> 01:27:12,094
I have been on my own
all my life.

1667
01:27:13,089 --> 01:27:15,535
Nobody even knows I'm here.
Nobody ever knows where I am.

1668
01:27:15,689 --> 01:27:17,612
Because there is nobody.

1669
01:27:20,009 --> 01:27:21,818
I got sick,
I took care of myself.

1670
01:27:21,889 --> 01:27:23,698
I needed shit for school,
I got it.

1671
01:27:24,929 --> 01:27:26,010
You're so stupid.

1672
01:27:26,089 --> 01:27:29,138
Do you think your
fucking fancy suit

1673
01:27:29,209 --> 01:27:31,655
and acting like an asshole is
gonna make your daughters happy?

1674
01:27:31,729 --> 01:27:32,776
You think that's
what they want?

1675
01:27:32,849 --> 01:27:35,773
They want some big man
treating people like shit?

1676
01:27:37,049 --> 01:27:40,132
I would have done anything
to have somebody like you.

1677
01:27:40,969 --> 01:27:43,700
Just to actually be there
and care about me.

1678
01:27:43,889 --> 01:27:45,891
Just to fucking be there.

1679
01:27:45,969 --> 01:27:49,132
You're such an asshole,
you're trying to be more like me.

1680
01:27:49,289 --> 01:27:51,053
Nice choice, Sandy.

1681
01:28:00,049 --> 01:28:02,734
Nice, I'm never gonna be able
to duplicate this makeup.

1682
01:28:02,889 --> 01:28:04,050
Here.

1683
01:28:04,209 --> 01:28:05,574
I don't want it.
I don't want it.

1684
01:28:06,169 --> 01:28:07,250
I'm sorry.

1685
01:28:07,609 --> 01:28:11,330
I'm sorry I gave you some
lame dumpster baby story.

1686
01:28:11,489 --> 01:28:12,490
I was just lying.

1687
01:28:12,729 --> 01:28:14,538
That's what I do, I lie.

1688
01:28:19,729 --> 01:28:21,254
Mr. Cornish.

1689
01:28:22,169 --> 01:28:25,093
You are a fraud, a thief,

1690
01:28:25,249 --> 01:28:27,456
and an asshole,
whoever you are.

1691
01:28:27,609 --> 01:28:29,293
You're both under arrest
for credit fraud.

1692
01:28:29,449 --> 01:28:31,292
Stand up. Hands where
I can see them.

1693
01:28:31,569 --> 01:28:33,890
- He didn't do anything. He's just trying to get me...
- Save it.

1694
01:28:33,969 --> 01:28:35,689
Put your hands in front of you.

1695
01:28:38,769 --> 01:28:40,612
Okay. Come on, let's go.

1696
01:29:09,969 --> 01:29:10,970
It's them.

1697
01:29:22,889 --> 01:29:24,812
See you around.

1698
01:29:36,449 --> 01:29:37,450
Yeah.

1699
01:29:37,569 --> 01:29:39,810
She got arrested.
What the hell do we do?

1700
01:29:40,489 --> 01:29:45,290
<i>Follow her to the station, you
bail her out and you kill her.</i>

1701
01:29:47,409 --> 01:29:48,456
Ahhh!

1702
01:29:48,529 --> 01:29:49,530
Damn it!

1703
01:29:49,689 --> 01:29:50,895
Burns, don't it?

1704
01:29:51,049 --> 01:29:52,858
You! What you do that for?

1705
01:29:53,369 --> 01:29:54,780
You shot me first.

1706
01:29:54,969 --> 01:29:57,939
I didn't shoot you.
This bitch shot you.

1707
01:29:58,729 --> 01:29:59,890
Good point.

1708
01:30:04,089 --> 01:30:05,739
You know what?
You're crazy!

1709
01:30:06,049 --> 01:30:09,735
Yep, diagnosis and everything.

1710
01:30:10,529 --> 01:30:11,974
Let's go for a ride.

1711
01:30:14,129 --> 01:30:15,699
Hey, man,
this is some bullshit.

1712
01:30:15,849 --> 01:30:18,216
If you wanna kill me, you
could just kill me right now.

1713
01:30:18,369 --> 01:30:19,849
Gotta get in this
motherfucking trunk.

1714
01:30:20,929 --> 01:30:23,330
I'm gonna get in this
motherfucking trunk for now.

1715
01:30:23,489 --> 01:30:24,570
How did you find us?

1716
01:30:24,729 --> 01:30:26,618
Same way you found them.

1717
01:30:26,769 --> 01:30:29,340
Car had satellite radio,
tracked the GPS.

1718
01:30:30,569 --> 01:30:33,254
What if we work together?
We split the cash.

1719
01:30:35,009 --> 01:30:37,171
This ain't about
the money anymore.

1720
01:30:37,329 --> 01:30:40,219
They wrecked my van,
this is personal.

1721
01:30:42,449 --> 01:30:43,860
Around, please.

1722
01:31:19,969 --> 01:31:22,700
Hey, you guys have got
a pretty sweet ride, here.

1723
01:31:22,849 --> 01:31:25,011
What is this?
An '08 or '09 Crown Vic?

1724
01:31:26,089 --> 01:31:27,215
'08.

1725
01:31:27,369 --> 01:31:30,134
Ah! '08.
All right, I thought so.

1726
01:31:30,889 --> 01:31:33,415
What is this, like
250 ponies under the hood?

1727
01:31:33,569 --> 01:31:35,412
You can feel that, right?

1728
01:31:35,569 --> 01:31:37,249
I need you to close your eyes.

1729
01:31:37,369 --> 01:31:39,178
What?
And slide right.

1730
01:31:39,529 --> 01:31:41,213
What the fuck?

1731
01:31:42,809 --> 01:31:44,538
Hey! Pull over, pull over!

1732
01:31:45,569 --> 01:31:46,570
Jesus Christ!

1733
01:31:52,449 --> 01:31:54,690
Are you out of your mind?
This is a terrible idea.

1734
01:31:55,289 --> 01:31:56,256
Hey! It's stuck.

1735
01:31:56,329 --> 01:31:57,740
Are you insane?
What are we doing?

1736
01:31:57,809 --> 01:31:59,049
We're getting away.

1737
01:31:59,209 --> 01:32:01,132
All units, we need backup!
We need backup!

1738
01:32:02,449 --> 01:32:04,929
Put down your weapon!
Get out of your vehicle!

1739
01:32:05,289 --> 01:32:07,610
We can't go this way.

1740
01:32:07,769 --> 01:32:08,975
Shit.
What now, huh?

1741
01:32:16,649 --> 01:32:17,696
Shit.

1742
01:32:21,329 --> 01:32:22,490
There.

1743
01:32:48,769 --> 01:32:50,851
Diana. Hey.

1744
01:32:51,809 --> 01:32:53,095
Diana.

1745
01:32:53,769 --> 01:32:55,055
Diana!

1746
01:33:07,809 --> 01:33:09,573
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go!

1747
01:33:10,449 --> 01:33:12,816
Get up, you fucking baby.

1748
01:33:17,369 --> 01:33:18,859
Don't move!

1749
01:33:20,609 --> 01:33:22,338
Keep your hands up.
Put them on the wheel.

1750
01:33:23,569 --> 01:33:24,934
Get out.

1751
01:33:28,169 --> 01:33:29,853
Slow down. I got
punched in the throat.

1752
01:33:30,009 --> 01:33:32,979
I got hit by a fucking car.
Did you see that?

1753
01:33:38,209 --> 01:33:39,449
What have you got in the trunk?

1754
01:33:39,769 --> 01:33:41,809
I don't know anything about
the people in the trunk.

1755
01:33:44,289 --> 01:33:45,415
Let me see your hands.

1756
01:33:45,489 --> 01:33:47,457
My hands? He shot me!

1757
01:33:47,529 --> 01:33:48,735
They shot me first.

1758
01:33:48,809 --> 01:33:50,049
We're all going downtown.

1759
01:33:50,569 --> 01:33:52,617
For what? I'm in a trunk.

1760
01:33:52,769 --> 01:33:54,612
How about you do your little
handcuff trick for me?

1761
01:33:54,769 --> 01:33:56,612
Just wait till we
get back to the car.

1762
01:33:56,769 --> 01:33:58,009
Oh, come on,
just take them off!

1763
01:33:58,169 --> 01:34:00,297
Shut up and give me a minute.

1764
01:34:03,169 --> 01:34:05,456
You should be dead.
You got hit by a car.

1765
01:34:05,649 --> 01:34:07,253
I mean, are you even human?

1766
01:34:07,409 --> 01:34:09,138
It just looked bad.

1767
01:34:09,289 --> 01:34:10,893
It sure did.

1768
01:34:12,809 --> 01:34:13,810
You know, the...

1769
01:34:14,009 --> 01:34:16,774
Part of the trick is
to just relax your legs.

1770
01:34:16,929 --> 01:34:18,533
Better chance of
catching a roll.

1771
01:34:18,689 --> 01:34:21,260
I read it on wikiHow.

1772
01:34:21,409 --> 01:34:24,777
You can make light of it, but
what you did saved my life.

1773
01:34:24,929 --> 01:34:26,852
And thank you.

1774
01:34:27,169 --> 01:34:30,218
You were only in that spot
because of me, so...

1775
01:34:31,169 --> 01:34:32,853
Fair is fair.

1776
01:35:10,980 --> 01:35:11,981
No, no, no, no.

1777
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:31,201
Hello?

1778
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:32,930
Dad!
Daddy!

1779
01:35:33,080 --> 01:35:34,411
Hi.

1780
01:35:34,680 --> 01:35:35,681
Mmm!

1781
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:40,325
Hi.

1782
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:47,526
Hmm.

1783
01:35:49,120 --> 01:35:51,930
Diana, Trish, Jessie, Franny.

1784
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:54,441
- Meet Diana.
- Hi.

1785
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:55,961
Oh.

1786
01:35:56,640 --> 01:35:57,500
Hi.

1787
01:35:57,700 --> 01:35:59,111
Nice to meet you.

1788
01:35:59,260 --> 01:36:00,671
Nice to meet you, too.

1789
01:36:00,820 --> 01:36:03,585
Diana's gonna be staying
with us just for tonight,

1790
01:36:03,660 --> 01:36:05,469
and I'm going to take her into
work with me in the morning.

1791
01:36:05,540 --> 01:36:07,110
If that's okay.

1792
01:36:07,460 --> 01:36:09,622
It's kind of mandatory.

1793
01:36:24,893 --> 01:36:26,895
You've got some
food on your face.

1794
01:36:27,653 --> 01:36:28,779
Where?

1795
01:36:28,853 --> 01:36:30,821
Up here, like, in this area.

1796
01:36:31,013 --> 01:36:32,822
No, you have food on your face.

1797
01:36:33,013 --> 01:36:34,424
No, I don't have food
on my face. Where?

1798
01:36:34,573 --> 01:36:35,574
There!

1799
01:36:35,933 --> 01:36:37,503
- Here?
- No!

1800
01:36:38,693 --> 01:36:40,377
I would know.
It's not over here.

1801
01:36:40,493 --> 01:36:42,257
- That's my clean cheek.
- Now you have three places.

1802
01:36:42,413 --> 01:36:44,177
Here, here and here.

1803
01:36:44,333 --> 01:36:47,496
You guys are driving me crazy,
because nothing's here.

1804
01:36:48,253 --> 01:36:49,414
Nothing's here.

1805
01:36:53,773 --> 01:36:54,854
See?

1806
01:36:54,933 --> 01:36:56,378
Babe, babe, please.

1807
01:36:57,093 --> 01:36:58,618
Oh! That's a lot.

1808
01:37:06,533 --> 01:37:08,023
Would you like
some help with that?

1809
01:37:08,773 --> 01:37:11,094
That's okay.
I'm almost done.

1810
01:37:14,773 --> 01:37:15,774
I, uh...

1811
01:37:16,453 --> 01:37:18,979
I know you're
probably wondering

1812
01:37:20,773 --> 01:37:25,142
what happened on our whole
trip and the open road.

1813
01:37:25,293 --> 01:37:30,823
And I just wanted to put your mind
at ease that nothing happened

1814
01:37:30,973 --> 01:37:33,499
between the two of us.

1815
01:37:35,109 --> 01:37:38,192
I put it out there,
but he did not pick it up.

1816
01:37:41,863 --> 01:37:43,388
And, you know, there's...

1817
01:37:43,783 --> 01:37:45,751
It's surprising.
'Cause I...

1818
01:37:45,903 --> 01:37:48,952
I don't know if you've heard
of the Bermuda Triangle,

1819
01:37:49,903 --> 01:37:52,304
which is kind of in here.

1820
01:37:54,143 --> 01:37:56,464
And it's... You know...

1821
01:37:57,103 --> 01:38:00,312
Once you go in, it's real
hard to come back out.

1822
01:38:01,263 --> 01:38:02,310
You know?

1823
01:38:02,383 --> 01:38:04,192
Because some people
don't want to.

1824
01:38:04,943 --> 01:38:08,584
Some people just get lost
in there, emotionally.

1825
01:38:09,503 --> 01:38:13,428
I just wanted you to know that
he was a perfect gentleman.

1826
01:38:14,703 --> 01:38:17,946
And he did not lay a finger,

1827
01:38:18,583 --> 01:38:19,584
you know,

1828
01:38:20,023 --> 01:38:22,230
on, or in, me.

1829
01:38:25,143 --> 01:38:26,474
Okay.

1830
01:38:30,423 --> 01:38:31,584
You know, I, uh...

1831
01:38:33,023 --> 01:38:34,787
He really loves you.

1832
01:38:37,543 --> 01:38:39,068
Thank you.

1833
01:38:41,303 --> 01:38:42,793
Okay.

1834
01:39:00,103 --> 01:39:02,151
She'd go away for, like,

1835
01:39:03,023 --> 01:39:04,354
10 years.

1836
01:39:05,303 --> 01:39:07,226
I mean, she's not a bad person.

1837
01:39:13,703 --> 01:39:16,513
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I'm such a chump.

1838
01:39:19,623 --> 01:39:21,193
You're not a chump.

1839
01:39:24,023 --> 01:39:25,752
If I didn't turn her in...

1840
01:39:26,343 --> 01:39:27,344
I mean...

1841
01:39:31,183 --> 01:39:32,628
We'd survive.

1842
01:40:18,303 --> 01:40:19,748
Diana.

1843
01:40:21,343 --> 01:40:23,186
I'm going in alone.

1844
01:40:30,623 --> 01:40:32,113
Where's Diana?

1845
01:40:33,183 --> 01:40:35,106
She said she had to go.

1846
01:40:38,383 --> 01:40:39,714
How long ago did she leave?

1847
01:40:40,223 --> 01:40:43,033
After she did our hair
and our makeup.

1848
01:41:12,223 --> 01:41:13,907
Well, as a shareholder
of the fund...

1849
01:41:14,903 --> 01:41:17,144
Couldn't make it happen.

1850
01:41:18,583 --> 01:41:21,826
And to be honest, it wouldn't
have happened anyway.

1851
01:41:23,143 --> 01:41:24,668
It just wasn't meant to be.

1852
01:41:25,303 --> 01:41:26,748
Patterson.

1853
01:41:43,263 --> 01:41:44,424
Hi.

1854
01:41:44,623 --> 01:41:46,113
Hi, Sandy.
Okay.

1855
01:41:46,263 --> 01:41:47,310
What's going on?

1856
01:41:47,383 --> 01:41:50,024
That completes the statement process.
You've been read your rights.

1857
01:41:50,063 --> 01:41:51,872
This officer's gonna
take you into custody.

1858
01:41:53,463 --> 01:41:55,113
Mr. Patterson.

1859
01:41:55,943 --> 01:41:57,945
You are no longer a focus
in this investigation.

1860
01:41:58,863 --> 01:42:01,912
And she took responsibility for
everything that happened in St. Louis.

1861
01:42:02,063 --> 01:42:03,503
I'd be happy to
provide your employer

1862
01:42:03,543 --> 01:42:04,874
with a letter
making that clear.

1863
01:42:06,543 --> 01:42:07,704
You got your good name back.

1864
01:42:08,543 --> 01:42:10,307
Congratulations.
Thanks.

1865
01:42:12,303 --> 01:42:15,591
Could I have just one
second with her, please?

1866
01:42:16,783 --> 01:42:18,308
Sure. Let's go.

1867
01:42:19,823 --> 01:42:21,029
Thanks.

1868
01:42:23,463 --> 01:42:25,023
I don't understand.

1869
01:42:25,023 --> 01:42:28,345
Well, if I pop out of these that
quickly, he'll get all emasculated.

1870
01:42:30,023 --> 01:42:31,627
And there was
a pretty good chance

1871
01:42:31,703 --> 01:42:34,274
that this thing was gonna
end with cops, right?

1872
01:42:34,823 --> 01:42:37,588
I just didn't think
I'd still be here.

1873
01:42:38,343 --> 01:42:41,711
I just thought I'd take
advantage of a free ride,

1874
01:42:42,063 --> 01:42:44,430
and when I felt
like it, skip out.

1875
01:42:47,023 --> 01:42:48,513
I just didn't do that.

1876
01:42:48,783 --> 01:42:50,353
How come you snuck
away this morning?

1877
01:42:50,623 --> 01:42:52,625
Because I knew you weren't
gonna turn me in.

1878
01:42:55,103 --> 01:42:56,912
And this was the right thing.

1879
01:43:00,783 --> 01:43:02,114
I gotta go.

1880
01:43:03,063 --> 01:43:04,303
Thank you.

1881
01:43:05,743 --> 01:43:07,666
I really loved our trip.

1882
01:43:23,543 --> 01:43:24,544
Congratulations.

1883
01:43:24,623 --> 01:43:25,829
Thanks.

1884
01:43:26,543 --> 01:43:28,750
This is you. Come on.

1885
01:43:34,063 --> 01:43:38,352
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1886
01:43:38,983 --> 01:43:43,750
<i>Happy birthday, dear Daddy</i>

1887
01:43:43,903 --> 01:43:45,393
Come on, girls.

1888
01:43:45,543 --> 01:43:49,070
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1889
01:43:49,143 --> 01:43:52,590
<i>Happy birthday to me</i>

1890
01:43:52,743 --> 01:43:54,233
Okay, big breath, big wish.

1891
01:43:54,303 --> 01:43:55,793
Everybody together.
Close together.

1892
01:43:56,903 --> 01:43:59,144
Yay for Daddy!

1893
01:43:59,823 --> 01:44:01,234
Does Mommy want one more?
Yes.

1894
01:44:01,423 --> 01:44:04,267
Honey, honey, honey, please. Are
you kidding me? Mmm mmm mmm.

1895
01:44:04,423 --> 01:44:07,552
You know what? Actually,
we'll take this to go.

1896
01:44:07,703 --> 01:44:10,513
We gotta go. It's very late.
Let's go.

1897
01:44:10,743 --> 01:44:12,586
I can't believe
how beautiful she is.

1898
01:44:13,343 --> 01:44:16,074
I mean, to me, she still... She
really does look like a Diana.

1899
01:44:16,143 --> 01:44:17,224
Let it go.

1900
01:44:17,703 --> 01:44:19,114
I'm letting it go, but...

1901
01:44:19,263 --> 01:44:20,947
Sorry.

1902
01:44:21,103 --> 01:44:22,184
Are you kidding me?

1903
01:44:22,263 --> 01:44:24,072
You are pulling these
out of your pocket. No.

1904
01:44:24,223 --> 01:44:26,794
I will shiv you in the yard. I
will shiv you in the yard, I will.

1905
01:44:27,263 --> 01:44:29,914
<i>All right,
visitation's over in five minutes.</i>

1906
01:44:29,983 --> 01:44:31,269
All right, break it down
for us real quick.

1907
01:44:31,623 --> 01:44:33,273
Okay. Here we go.

1908
01:44:33,703 --> 01:44:34,704
Math, A.

1909
01:44:34,783 --> 01:44:35,784
Typical.

1910
01:44:35,863 --> 01:44:37,194
Accounting, B.

1911
01:44:37,263 --> 01:44:38,344
Nice.

1912
01:44:38,463 --> 01:44:39,749
And Econ?

1913
01:44:39,903 --> 01:44:41,871
Well, you know.
What happened?

1914
01:44:42,023 --> 01:44:43,787
You guys have been studying
for weeks, haven't you?

1915
01:44:43,943 --> 01:44:45,593
I know, but I just got this.

1916
01:44:45,983 --> 01:44:47,109
Oh!

1917
01:44:47,943 --> 01:44:49,308
Nice going.

1918
01:44:49,463 --> 01:44:50,544
I know. I know.

1919
01:44:50,703 --> 01:44:51,863
I'm putting this in the file.

1920
01:44:51,943 --> 01:44:55,425
Oh, come on, it's not like
somebody's gonna hire an ex-con.

1921
01:44:55,703 --> 01:44:58,434
I'm actually starting
a first step program,

1922
01:44:58,583 --> 01:44:59,994
and I have a few years
to figure it out.

1923
01:45:00,063 --> 01:45:01,553
Three, with good behavior.

1924
01:45:01,703 --> 01:45:03,705
And how is that going,
by the way?

1925
01:45:03,823 --> 01:45:04,904
Great. Great.

1926
01:45:04,983 --> 01:45:06,064
Decent, you know.
Good.

1927
01:45:06,143 --> 01:45:09,511
Some of these dykes are still really
getting up into my sweet junk,

1928
01:45:09,583 --> 01:45:11,153
but I don't let them.

1929
01:45:11,303 --> 01:45:13,465
Girls, "sweet junk" is just...

1930
01:45:13,663 --> 01:45:16,587
Dessert. She's having
a problem in the mess hall.

1931
01:45:16,663 --> 01:45:17,664
We should probably get going.

1932
01:45:17,743 --> 01:45:20,189
The lesson there,
if you listen,

1933
01:45:20,463 --> 01:45:22,465
is that if you're in the woods,

1934
01:45:22,543 --> 01:45:26,832
maybe a boyish female bear
with corn rows

1935
01:45:27,183 --> 01:45:32,030
comes at you this way, meaning
this way, and you just deflect.

1936
01:45:32,783 --> 01:45:36,788
It is always nice to see
you, and we'll wait out...

1937
01:45:36,943 --> 01:45:38,024
Girls, let's get going.

1938
01:45:38,143 --> 01:45:40,669
What are you gonna do? Not let
them in, right? Come here.

1939
01:45:40,823 --> 01:45:42,313
Bye, Diana.

1940
01:45:42,463 --> 01:45:44,192
Stay beautiful, okay?

1941
01:45:46,503 --> 01:45:47,629
Okay, I'll see you
in a couple months?

1942
01:45:47,863 --> 01:45:49,467
Okay. Love you.

1943
01:45:49,623 --> 01:45:51,068
Love you, too.

1944
01:45:52,183 --> 01:45:53,514
I got you something.

1945
01:45:54,063 --> 01:45:55,747
Ooh! I pulled some
strings with Reilly,

1946
01:45:55,903 --> 01:45:59,305
and we ran your fingerprints through
the Wisconsin state database,

1947
01:45:59,503 --> 01:46:01,028
and we got that.

1948
01:46:07,183 --> 01:46:08,309
My name.

1949
01:46:10,703 --> 01:46:11,943
Dawn Budgie.

1950
01:46:13,863 --> 01:46:16,230
That's a terrible fucking name.

1951
01:46:16,863 --> 01:46:18,353
It's a really bad name.

1952
01:46:19,863 --> 01:46:23,072
It's not as great as I
was hoping, but it's you.

1953
01:46:23,703 --> 01:46:25,228
Thanks, Sandy.

1954
01:46:28,703 --> 01:46:30,831
But I already know who I am.

1955
01:46:38,743 --> 01:46:40,552
Yep. Thanks.

1956
01:47:03,383 --> 01:47:05,226
Back in your cage, bitch.

1957
01:47:07,183 --> 01:47:08,867
Shit!

1958
01:47:09,663 --> 01:47:11,028
Budgie?

1959
01:47:14,543 --> 01:47:15,749
Sorry.

1960
01:51:10,583 --> 01:51:12,312
<i>No, Sandy's a girl's name.</i>

1961
01:51:12,383 --> 01:51:13,908
<i>It's not, it's unisex!</i>
