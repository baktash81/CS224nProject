1
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,029
¶ Fuckin' posers

2
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,159
¶ Yeah

3
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,554
¶ Fuckin' posers

4
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,831
¶ It's almost over now,
it's almost over now

5
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,591
¶ For you fuckin' posers

6
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,319
¶ Yeah

7
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,715
¶ It's almost over now,
it's almost over now

8
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,834
¶ You think the way you live's OK

9
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,875
¶ You think posing will save the day

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,755
¶ You think we don't see
that you're running

11
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,395
¶ Better call your boys
cos I'm coming... ¶

12
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,077
I don't think your mammy'd be
too pleased about that now.

13
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,394
What a beautiful fuckin' day.

14
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,840
- Who the fuck are you?
- Aidan McBride, Sergeant.

15
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,394
- Don't know you.
- Just transferred from Dublin.

16
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,878
Big city boy, huh?
And me just a lowly country nobody.

17
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,036
- Lonely?
- Huh?

18
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,913
- Lonely country nobody?
- Lowly. Lowly.

19
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,917
Lowly. I thought you said "lonely".

20
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,996
Not too sharp on the uptake, are you?

21
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,030
You'll go far in this outfit.
Fuckin' latte's my drink.

22
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,550
They told me cappuccino.

23
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,432
What the fuck is he doing here?

24
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,955
- He's the scene-of-crime photographer.
- Are you soft in the head or what?

25
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,919
Get out, Mick,
or I'll tell your mammy about you.

26
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,511
I got what I need anyways, Gerry.
It's all good clean fun, huh?

27
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,396
I'm worried about that young lad.

28
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,034
He's an interest in the photographic arts
I can only describe as unhealthy.

29
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,116
He looks like Brendan Foley.

30
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,391
I knew his father.
He ran off with me second cousin.

31
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,592
When I say "ran off", he was
in a wheelchair, the old fella.

32
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,756
He was a what, er,
what do you call it?

33
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,519
- Er, paraplegic?
- Spastic, yeah.

34
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,995
Wheeled off.

35
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,680
Brendan Foley. I'll get onto this.

36
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:59,950
I said he looked like Brendan Foley.
I didn't say he was Brendan Foley.

37
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,829
Should you, er,
should you be removing those?

38
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,511
From the Bible, looks like. I knew
there'd be a fuckin' religious angle.

39
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,075
Aye, he was a good-looking lad.
Lovely lips.

40
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,436
The significance of the pot plant
has me somewhat perplexed.

41
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:30,032
- Maybe its genus is a clue.
- Oh, genus, huh? Fancy.

42
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:39,311
- What the hell are you doing?
- I have the gift. Nobody tell you?

43
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,112
Clairvoyant, like.

44
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,471
Never interfered with a corpse before,
no? It's great gas.

45
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,068
- I don't think you should...
- I'm only messing.

46
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,589
- Lighten up!
- I don't think it was appropriate.

47
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,998
Fuck off to America with your
"appropriate" fuckin' Barack Obama.

48
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,588
I was just saying.

49
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,678
- Is there any money in the house?
- What? No.

50
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,518
I mean, I haven't checked.

51
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,835
You haven't checked
if there's any money?

52
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,032
What sort of a fucking guard are you,
anyways?

53
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,991
Five and a half...

54
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,997
Five and a half.

55
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,636
Now what the fuck would that mean?

56
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,274
There's a film called "8½".

57
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,913
Fellini.

58
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,877
There's another film called "Se 7 en".

59
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,753
Are you going to list
a load of film titles with numbers?

60
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,519
I can do that.
That's your idea of police work?

61
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:36,509
Maybe this is the killer's
five and a half... halfth victim.

62
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,039
Go on.

63
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,514
Maybe he's killed four people before
now, and he's maimed another lad.

64
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,393
Cut off his legs maybe,
which'd be the half.

65
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,080
So this'd be victim number
five and a half.

66
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,873
Interesting theory.

67
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,755
So what you're saying is, we may well
have a serial killer on our hands.

68
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,836
It's a distinct possibility.

69
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,434
Well, that'd be a first for Galway.

70
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,671
Rabbit.

71
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,394
Sergeant Gerry Boyle. Cop shop.

72
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,115
Hi, little piggy. I've got information
about that murder last night.

73
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,195
What murder?

74
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,039
How many fucking murders
have you had in the last 24 hours?

75
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,991
That's for us to know
and you to find out.

76
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,115
That doesn't make any sense.

77
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,391
Have you any information or are you
sitting there playing with yourself?

78
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,556
What's your name? Boyle?

79
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,911
Sergeant Gerry Boyle,
the last of the independents.

80
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:08,956
The murder in Lettermore.
The one with... occult overtones.

81
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,957
Occult overtones, yeah.

82
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,355
Do you know what I mean
when I say "occult"?

83
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,638
Aleister Crowley.

84
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,514
Anton La Vey.

85
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,314
- Simon Magus, that kind of thing.
- Well done.

86
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,193
Round of applause.
Red roses for the blue meanie.

87
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,756
Anyways, it was Billy Devaney
did for him.

88
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,952
He's into all that black magic.
That's "magik" with a K.

89
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,951
Yeah, he told me last night
when he was locked.

90
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,389
Little Billy Devaney
wouldn't hurt a fly.

91
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,159
He didn't hurt a fly.
He put a bullet in your man's brain.

92
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,077
Good point. Could I have your name?

93
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,078
Yeah, Bozo the fucking clown!

94
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:54,232
Bozo... the... fucking... clown.

95
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,957
I didn't know the circus was in town.

96
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,676
Little Billy Devaney a serial killer?

97
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,954
Sure, he's a lovely little lad.

98
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,790
Fuckin' Andy Murray.

99
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,037
You won't be playing tennis again
for a long time, boy.

100
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,594
I was playing squash.

101
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,554
No squash courts where you're
headed, Ted Bundy of the West.

102
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,437
- Now...
- What are you, Italian?

103
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,599
No, I am not fuckin' Italian! Why does
everybody keep saying that?

104
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,075
- Cos you look Italian.
- I fuckin' don't.

105
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,430
Yes, you do.
Doesn't he look Italian?

106
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,074
You've been cautioned
under the Bestiality Act.

107
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,111
Man, that was fuckin' years ago.

108
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,470
I thought that had been
forgotten about.

109
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,636
Same thing happened to Polanski.

110
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,115
What was it?
A sheep or something?

111
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,800
It was a llama.

112
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,279
I didn't know it was illegal
to interfere with a llama. Did you?

113
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:59,632
I would have assumed so, Billy.
I mean, what would its parents think?

114
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,915
William Montmorency Devaney,

115
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,397
where were you at approximately nine
in the pm last night? Thereabouts.

116
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,069
I was approximately in Hanley's
battering Joey Brennan about the head

117
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,191
until he lapsed into unconsciousness.

118
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,997
Why were you bat...?

119
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,078
- Why were you battering him?
- I was provoked, like.

120
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,395
Look, we're having a few jars, right,

121
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,592
when he brings up yet a-fucking-gain
this 200 euros I owe him.

122
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,075
He's had me computer
that I lent him for a year.

123
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,476
I says, "Give me my fuckin' computer,
I'll give you your euros".

124
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,716
Then suddenly, right out of nowhere,

125
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,910
he rears up at me
screaming for his money.

126
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,873
I grab hold of the nearest thing
that came into me hands.

127
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,434
This antique blunderbuss
me granddaddy got me...

128
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,676
Antique what?

129
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,552
Blunderbuss.

130
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,476
I was, er, showing it off, like,
and then the next thing you know,

131
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,398
I was battering him around
the fuckin' head with it.

132
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,751
I mean, that is vicious, like,
I'll admit.

133
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,996
What are you talking about?

134
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,671
You shot him in the head. You stuffed
pages from the Bible into his mouth.

135
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,076
You put a pot plant on his body
and painted "5½" on the wall.

136
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,919
Sweet Jesus on a stick,
you have me under false pretences.

137
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,952
Now, look, I thought this was
about Joey Brennan. Huh?

138
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,834
- What the fuck?
- The murder in the holiday home.

139
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,952
Jesus, lads, this was about 9:00pm,
wasn't it?

140
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,436
Aren't I telling ye I was in Hanley's?
I have about 20 witnesses.

141
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,235
Joey Brennan was fuckin' alive when
I left him, so you can't get me on that!

142
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,432
Wasn't he roaring at me
with his fuckin' broken lip?

143
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,710
You said he lapsed
into unconsciousness.

144
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:57,197
Yes, he lapsed into unconsciousness
and after that he fuckin' woke up.

145
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,749
- And that's the whole story?
- That is the whole story.

146
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,592
- Has he made a complaint?
- No, he hasn't.

147
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,915
He's made a fuckin' nuisance call,
it looks like.

148
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,952
Haul in this Joey Brennan,
see what he has to say.

149
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,913
See if we can charge him
with wasting police time.

150
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,110
Then get round
to this gobshite's house,

151
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,198
and charge his grandda
with illegal possession of a firearm.

152
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,436
- No, come on.
- I'm on it, Sarge.

153
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:33,718
"I'm on it, Sarge".
He thinks he's in fuckin' Detroit.

154
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,752
So, your mother...
Six to eight weeks is the prognosis.

155
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,714
- That's what they told me.
- That is how long she has, then.

156
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,389
- She looks fine. Healthy.
- Hmm.

157
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,398
It's not what is on the outside
that counts,

158
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:59,593
it's what is on the inside...
eating away at you.

159
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,551
I just want her to be comfortable.

160
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,036
That's all.

161
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,590
- What are you reading?
- Oh.

162
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,391
Never got into the Russians.

163
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,517
They take too long
getting to the feckin' point.

164
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,471
Not even Dostoyevsky, no?

165
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,751
Come on, he was the main offender.

166
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,756
Gogol was good.

167
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,038
He went doolally in the end, though.
God love him.

168
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,595
How are you settling in?

169
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,915
Oh, all right, I suppose.

170
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,831
They're all so fuckin' boring.

171
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,798
Who?

172
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,751
The inmates.

173
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,598
Including me.

174
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,035
I suppose they've a right
to be gloomy.

175
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,596
There's no need to make such
a fuckin' song and dance about it!

176
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,560
'You're gonna die, copper'.

177
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,829
- 'Come on, copper'.
- Little early for a drink.

178
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,077
You're still on duty.

179
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,751
- You've been gone all afternoon.
- 'Flesh wound. Flesh wound'.

180
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,314
Are you going to make
declarative statements

181
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,192
or fuckin' tell me something?

182
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,878
The murder over in Lettermore,
the victim's a John Doe.

183
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,831
He's a John Doe, is he?

184
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,793
- Yeah. It means...
- I know what it fuckin' means. Go on.

185
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,592
'Good shot! '

186
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,918
The name and address he gave
are false. We sent off his prints.

187
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,794
Anything else?
You're boring the hole off me.

188
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,631
You got a call from Galway.

189
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,231
You're to head in tonight to attend a
briefing from a fella over from the FBI.

190
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,238
Special Agent Wendell Everett.

191
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,632
So what?

192
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,591
Maybe it's about the murder.

193
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,191
Maybe he's got a psychological profile
on the killer or something.

194
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,197
It's drug smuggling.

195
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,073
Or they've had another sighting
of Whitey Bulger

196
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,031
at some fuckin' museum.

197
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:51,358
Yeah, well, drug smuggling...
I mean, that's pretty exciting.

198
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,634
Yeah, it's fuckin' exciting.

199
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,672
If you think standing
on the fuckin' pier at Rossaveal

200
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,598
in the pouring fuckin' rain
for hours on end

201
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,711
waiting on a fuckin' ship

202
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,752
that's never gonna fuckin' arrive
is fuckin' exciting.

203
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,632
Now go get me a pint.

204
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,228
'Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Good shot. Oh, oh, oh, oh! '

205
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,279
The vessel
we are looking for is a 60-foot ship

206
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,356
called the "Annabel Lee".

207
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,995
We lost it three weeks ago
when it left the Dominican Republic.

208
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,317
The DEA believe it to have
somewhere in the vicinity

209
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,318
of $500 million worth
of cocaine on board.

210
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,273
- It may well...
- Er, that's half a billion, lads.

211
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,236
Half a billion.

212
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,798
Er, thank you, Inspector Stanton.
Yes, that's half a billion.

213
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,477
Slide.

214
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,398
The men we believe to be involved
in the trafficking

215
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,353
are Francis Sheehy-Skeffington
out of Dublin.

216
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,995
Next.
Liam O'Leary also out of Dublin.

217
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,315
Next.
Clive Cornell out of London.

218
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,196
Next. And James McCormick
out of Limerick.

219
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,153
Now, these men
are highly dangerous and if...

220
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,353
And if you do make a si...

221
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,198
Yes, Sergeant?

222
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,959
I thought only black lads
were drug dealers.

223
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,999
I'm sorry, what?

224
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,032
I thought only black lads
were drug dealers. And Mexicans.

225
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,957
They have a word for them.

226
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:39,119
There's a word for you too, sir,
but I'm not gonna go into that now.

227
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,475
Anyway, as I was saying, these men
are highly dangerous. And if...

228
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,431
Mules! Drug mules!

229
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,077
That's enough of your guff, Boyle.
Apologise to the man.

230
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,838
Huh? Apologise for what?

231
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,475
- Er, you know for what.
- For your racist slurs for one thing.

232
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,239
I'm Irish, sure.
Racism's part of my culture.

233
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,191
Enough. You're showing us up.

234
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,754
- Fucking knacker.
- Fuck off back to Dublin.

235
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,189
- I'll rip your fuckin' head off, Boyle!
- Relax.

236
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,639
Sit down!

237
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,510
Now, now, lads, come on,
not in front of the American.

238
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,839
- He's just messing, Agent Everett.
- Deliberately disrupting my lecture.

239
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,272
Ah, I'm only having a bit of fun, like.
Don't mean anything by it.

240
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,756
Half a billion dollars' worth of cocaine
is a subject for levity?

241
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,792
- Street value.
- Excuse me?

242
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,798
Street value. You always announce
a seizure of drugs

243
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,150
worth a street value
of ten million dollars

244
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,590
or 20 million dollars
or half a billion dollars.

245
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,871
I do wonder what street it is
you're buying your cocaine on,

246
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,231
because it's not the same street
as I'm buying my cocaine on.

247
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,750
That's enough. We've had enough
of your wisecracks for one day.

248
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,839
If you continue on in this vein, you can
consider yourself under suspension.

249
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,793
- Oh, I doubt that.
- You doubt that?

250
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,878
You got balls talking
to your superior officer like that.

251
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,149
If we were in Atlanta...

252
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,033
- We're not, though.
- If we were in Atlanta...

253
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,435
- Galway.
- you'd be ticketing jaywalkers.

254
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,915
- Galway!
- That's it. Consider yourself...

255
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,156
You're not hunting four men,
only three.

256
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,748
- How's that?
- McCormick is dead.

257
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,519
- What makes you think that?
- Well, I hope he's dead.

258
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,200
They've put him into
the fuckin' morgue anyways.

259
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,799
- Schopenhauer.
- I'd say Nietzsche.

260
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,673
Nietzsche! You haven't fucking
read any Nietzsche.

261
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:57,237
- I have, too. Erm, "The Antichrist".
- Quote me something, then.

262
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,955
- "What does not kill me"...
- Fuck's sake. Every child knows that.

263
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,798
- Bertrand Russell.
- Bertrand Russell. Are you listening?

264
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,480
Fuckin' English.
Everything has to be fuckin' English.

265
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,752
Name your favourite philosopher,
lo and behold, he's fuckin' English.

266
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,029
- He's Welsh.
- Huh?

267
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,390
Bertrand Russell was Welsh.

268
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,511
- Bertrand Russell was Welsh?
- Yeah.

269
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,076
You know, I never knew that.

270
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,873
Didn't think anybody interesting
was Welsh.

271
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,434
- Dylan Thomas.
- Like I said.

272
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,788
Ah. "You will not get the crowd
to cry hosanna

273
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:38,833
"until you ride into town on an ass".
Nietzsche.

274
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,599
- Yeah, that's a good one.
- Good quote. Nice one.

275
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,955
Oh, fuck it.

276
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,479
The guards.

277
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,074
- We weren't speeding.
- I know.

278
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,829
- One of the back lights out there?
- No, you're fine there.

279
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,758
Well, what did you
fuckin' stop us for, then?

280
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,598
Excuse me?

281
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:44,510
What did you fucking stop us for, then,
you stupid fucking cunt?

282
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,231
Get out, the lot of you.

283
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,990
- Nice friend you got.
- These English, what can you do?

284
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,350
- IDs, please.
- From Dublin, are you?

285
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,233
- IDs, please.
- Your name? I know a lot of guards.

286
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,828
- You know a lot of guards?
- He's a very friendly fella.

287
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,033
- No harm in it. What's the name?
- Get this over with, for fuck's sake.

288
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,356
- What's the name?
- McBride.

289
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,278
McBride.
We know all about you, McBride.

290
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,836
- Do we know about McBride, Liam?
- We do, Francis.

291
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,155
Should we be using our real names,
though?

292
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,794
- What does it matter now, Liam?
- You're right.

293
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:32,629
- We know all about you, McBride.
- You know nothing about me.

294
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:36,355
- Stop, McBride. It's no use.
- Stop, McBride!

295
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,629
Turn around, now, there's a good lad.

296
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,151
Nah. I'll take it as it comes,
if it's all the same to you.

297
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,272
- Show you up for the cowards you are.
- Suit yourself!

298
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,917
- He took that very well.
- He was very philosophical about it.

299
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,758
- Are we going now?
- We have to dump the body.

300
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,791
- I don't do manual labour.
- Come on.

301
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:06,390
No. When I applied for the post
of international drug trafficker,

302
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:10,035
it said nothing about "must have
experience of heavy lifting".

303
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,598
Into the west.

304
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,030
Been to Ireland before, Wendell?

305
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,037
Can't say that I have, no.

306
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,549
Where are you from, originally?

307
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,069
Originally, Wisconsin.

308
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,839
Oh. Whereabouts in Wisconsin?

309
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,359
Kenosha.

310
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,994
Kenosha, Wisconsin.

311
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,112
So how would you wind up
in Tennessee?

312
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,629
How did you know
I was in Tennessee?

313
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,512
Wasn't that where you were stationed

314
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,518
when you caught Tyrell Lee Dobbs,
the Knoxville Ripper?

315
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,756
You been doing your research on me?

316
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,509
Ah, I'm sure you did the same
with me.

317
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,598
Sorry, I didn't really have the time.

318
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,870
Ah, sure, you're a busy man,
I know that.

319
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:11,036
- D'you know where I'd like to go?
- No. Where would you like to go?

320
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,277
- Tupelo. Birthplace of the King.
- Mississippi.

321
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,277
My wife's from Jackson.

322
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,879
- How long have you been married?
- Eight years.

323
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,151
- Any kids?
- Two boys.

324
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:29,070
Stokely's five years old.
Huey just turned three months old.

325
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,714
- I got a picture of him.
- I don't want to see it.

326
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,235
Excuse me?

327
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:37,716
I don't want to see it.
Babies all look the same.

328
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,389
The only time a baby doesn't look like
every other baby

329
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,192
is when it's a really ugly baby.

330
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:47,393
So, unless it's a photo of a really
ugly baby, I don't want to see it.

331
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,399
- Well, that's pretty fuckin' rude.
- Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.

332
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,351
Oh, it is.

333
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,153
I'd like to have a family someday.

334
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,748
Too busy whoring around
and getting fucked up now.

335
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,348
I don't think
you should be telling me this stuff.

336
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:06,235
You know, I've been reading...
where they're smuggling the cocaine

337
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,191
out of Colombia in little submarines.

338
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,788
Submarines they've built themselves,
like.

339
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,469
Yeah, sounds insane, but it is true.
You are correct.

340
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,954
Crafty little beggars.
You have to admire their enterprise.

341
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,719
- No, Sergeant. You don't.
- You do.

342
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,349
You ever been to the States?

343
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,277
Yeah, once. Disney World.

344
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,275
What, when you were a kid
with your family?

345
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,834
No, this was last year.

346
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,428
- You went with a girlfriend?
- No, God, no.

347
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,917
You went to Disney World
by yourself?

348
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,031
Yeah. Great gas it was.

349
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,596
Had me picture taken with Goofy.
He's my favourite, Goofy.

350
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,034
I can't tell if you're really
motherfucking dumb

351
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,116
or really motherfucking smart.

352
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,158
'Put your fingers to your ears
when you want me to stop! '

353
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,516
Sergeant Boyle?

354
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,108
There's been a mix-up.
You've the wrong night.

355
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,233
I'm sorry?

356
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:48,069
- You're from the agency?
- No. My husband is missing.

357
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,475
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
Come in, come in.

358
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,477
I'll just slip into something
a little less comfortable.

359
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,597
Nice mug of tea.

360
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,509
Now...

361
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,429
So your husband is missing,
you were saying?

362
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,676
- I didn't get your name.
- Gabriela.

363
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,872
Gerry. So?

364
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,798
My husband is missing, yeah.
I think so, yes.

365
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,357
- Name?
- Aidan McBride.

366
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,836
Aidan McBride.
Not the guard, Aidan McBride?

367
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,679
Yes. He started working here today.

368
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,438
- How long has he been missing?
- Since tonight.

369
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:39,269
That's no time at all, sure.
He might be on the tear somewhere.

370
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:43,439
- He does not drink.
- He doesn't drink?

371
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,836
He called me at eight o'clock.
He said he was on his way home.

372
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,520
I've tried his cellphone, but it's dead.

373
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,037
Ah, there's been no accidents
on the road as far as I know.

374
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,991
I'm only after getting in meself.

375
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,635
- Would it be to do with your work?
- Ah, no.

376
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,672
Do you mean, has he gone
undercover with the Mob?

377
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:07,920
Ah, no. You'd have to head down
to Limerick for that sort of excitement.

378
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,111
- How long have you been married?
- Three years.

379
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,755
- Where are you from? Romania?
- Croatia.

380
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,838
Ah, Croatia.
Good footballers, the Croatians.

381
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,428
They used to be, anyway.

382
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,233
Listen, I'm sure
there's an innocent explanation.

383
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,998
If you still haven't heard anything
by tomorrow evening,

384
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,591
that'll be 24 hours, and I can put out
a county-wide alarm.

385
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,272
What did they used to call
those things? On the telly?

386
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,756
- I'm sorry?
- APB.

387
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,440
"I'm putting out an APB".

388
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,074
You never hear that any more, do ye?

389
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,149
- Thank you again.
- Good luck.

390
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,112
I'll see ya.

391
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,791
Bit chilly out, huh?

392
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,556
Looked pretty impressive out there,
Sergeant.

393
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,830
I was fourth in the Olympics.

394
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,190
Bullshit.

395
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,915
Yeah, Seoul '88. Lovely people,
the South Koreans. Lovely food.

396
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,113
Bullshit.

397
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,674
No, 1500-metres freestyle.

398
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,791
I thought I was odds on
for the bronze.

399
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:38,390
The two Germans I was prepared for,
but fuckin' Salnikov.

400
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:42,115
Supposed to be over the hill. Russians
never know when they're beaten.

401
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,470
"The Monster in the Waves",
they called him.

402
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,556
You were fourth in the Olympics?

403
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:50,639
You don't get anything for fourth.
It's a cruel world.

404
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,272
So, Kenosha, Wisconsin,
you were saying.

405
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,831
Did you grow up in the Projects?

406
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,235
- What?
- Did you grow up in the Projects?

407
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,351
Or do they not have Projects
in Kenosha?

408
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,552
No, I did not grow up in the Projects.

409
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,240
It might surprise you to learn,
Sergeant Boyle,

410
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,635
that I come from
a very privileged background.

411
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,513
And by "privileged",
I mean prep schools, Yale.

412
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,474
I was a Rhodes Scholar. Bet you don't
even know what a Rhodes Scholar is.

413
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,353
- I do know what a Rhodes Scholar is.
- Enlighten me.

414
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,038
Kris Kristofferson.

415
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,878
Yeah, Kris Kristofferson
was a Rhodes Scholar.

416
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,797
You are correct.

417
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,272
Privileged background, huh?

418
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:42,029
Summer in the Hamptons,
skiing in Aspen. That kind of thing.

419
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:46,358
Skiing, yeah?
I thought black people couldn't ski.

420
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,671
Or is that swimming?

421
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,189
Ho. Ho.

422
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,590
So what do you have planned
for your day?

423
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:06,271
Well, we obviously don't know
who killed McCormick or why.

424
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,358
There was no useful forensic
evidence at the crime scene,

425
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,358
so I thought we might start
by canvassing the neighbourhood

426
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,438
where the body was discovered,
see if anybody heard something.

427
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,597
We also must consider the fact
that McCormick was probably

428
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,712
reconnoitring drop-off points
all along the coast.

429
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,229
- Sergeant.
- What?

430
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,470
Sorry, you lost me at "we".

431
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,558
We. You and I.

432
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,913
It's my day off. Did I not tell ya?

433
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,917
It's your day off?

434
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,393
I've had it booked for a good while.
You can ask Stanton.

435
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:45,479
We're investigating a murder,
trafficking of half a million dollars'...

436
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,749
Billion.

437
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,189
...half a billion dollars' worth
of cocaine,

438
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,151
and you're telling me it's your day off?

439
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,670
I'm sure 24 hours
won't make any difference.

440
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,157
24 hours won't make any difference?

441
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:01,114
They say it does on these cop shows,
but it doesn't. Not in my experience.

442
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,835
Ah, why do you keep repeating
everything I say?

443
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:27,195
How are you? Special Agent Everett,
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

444
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,038
Could I ask you a few questions?

445
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:37,630
Oh, you don't... You don't speak
any English, huh?

446
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,275
And you don't speak any English?

447
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,911
I just wanna show you a few pictures,

448
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:55,797
see if you've seen any of these men
in the last few days. This gentleman?

449
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,549
I'm sorry.
Is there anyone else here that I...?

450
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,478
So where are you taking us
to have your wicked way?

451
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,034
- I've a room booked at the G.
- Oh, fancy.

452
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:23,948
- No expense spared.
- Are we not too official for the G?

453
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,672
Whether you are or you aren't,

454
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,076
they'll have Sergeant Gerry Boyle
to deal with if they don't like it.

455
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,078
- He's power mad.
- They say power corrupts.

456
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,909
And I'm corrupted absolutely.
You'll find that out soon enough.

457
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,038
- Are you the FBI man?
- Yes, I am.

458
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:56,675
- Behavioural Science Unit?
- Er, no.

459
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,110
Actually I'm investigating
the smuggling of narcotics.

460
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,071
Ah, drugs.

461
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,196
Hurry up, Aoife.
I'm tumescent.

462
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,595
You're not in bad shape
for an auld lad.

463
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,792
- So me mother's telling me.
- Sergeant!

464
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,832
You're not that old, Sergeant.
Don't listen to her.

465
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,598
Ah, I'm old enough to be your father.

466
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,633
You think about that while you're
fucking us, if that's what turns you on.

467
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:28,116
Oh, Sinead, you're one sick puppy.
I think I'm in love.

468
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,911
What's the craic?

469
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:35,874
- Just a little memento. Looky.
- You can put it in your archive.

470
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,118
- I know what I'd put in your archive.
- The man's obsessed.

471
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,434
Ha, Wonderbra.

472
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:44,154
Now it can be revealed.
I have very small breasts.

473
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,350
That's OK. I have a very small penis.

474
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,596
Sergeant!

475
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,790
How you doing, sir?

476
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,479
Special Agent Wendell Everett of...

477
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,953
Sir?

478
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,034
Sir?

479
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,752
Seen this guy?

480
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,517
What about this one?

481
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,799
No? You don't speak English
either, huh?

482
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,111
This is the life.

483
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,879
Are we to assume
you're satisfied with the service?

484
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,992
I'm totally drained, sure.
I've no jism left.

485
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,634
Be giving us a good review
at the agency now.

486
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,910
Oh, five stars.

487
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,510
- Only wish I'd brought me handcuffs.
- There's always next time.

488
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:39,474
- You'd be into a bit of bondage?
- Only for you, Sergeant.

489
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,397
Only for you.

490
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,675
Ah, for fuck's sake.

491
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,158
I do not understand.

492
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,636
Just because his car is here,
why does it mean he killed himself?

493
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,637
It's a suicide hot spot.

494
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,320
A lot of the locals have
drowned themselves here.

495
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,671
That's why we have to put up
with these prima donnas.

496
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,519
I do not think
Aidan committed suicide.

497
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:45,712
Neither do I, to be honest with ye.
Didn't seem intelligent enough.

498
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:50,391
Course, if it's not suicide,
then it's foul play.

499
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,918
Foul play?

500
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,235
Murder. Malice aforethought.

501
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:01,954
But I cannot think who would have
wanted to do something bad to Aidan.

502
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,071
He's a guard.

503
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,431
Somebody somewhere probably
had a grudge against him.

504
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,233
It's a better theory than suicide,
in my view.

505
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:17,479
Is there anything you can tell me
that might have a bearing on all this?

506
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,871
- Anything personal?
- He's gay.

507
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,956
He's gay. You know,
when one man puts his...

508
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,719
I'm familiar with
the mechanics of it, yeah.

509
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,477
I just didn't realise.

510
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:39,917
Do you think he met someone there
who would do something bad to him?

511
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,476
Like, you know, what do you say?

512
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,832
- Like a rent boy or something?
- Yeah, a rent boy.

513
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:55,429
No, there's not much call for rent boys
around here, as far as I know.

514
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,391
Maybe in town.

515
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,672
Why'd you marry him?

516
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,791
For the visa, I suppose?

517
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,311
It's just between you and me.

518
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,715
Yes. I get a visa and he looks...

519
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,558
- Respectable.
- Yes, respectable.

520
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,799
Wendell.

521
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,309
Hmm, nice outfit.
Do you juggle as well?

522
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,590
Fuck you, Sergeant.

523
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,757
Hot whiskey, John-Joe, please.
And a cold one while I'm waiting.

524
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,756
- Yourself?
- Er, Guinness.

525
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,836
Two Guinnesses as well, John-Joe.

526
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,033
Like the fat man said, if you have
to be careful not to drink too much,

527
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:03,358
it's because you're not to be trusted
when you do. Any luck?

528
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:07,268
Not a damn thing.
Man, these people out here are...

529
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,710
- I know. It's like Compton, huh?
- Exactly.

530
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:14,594
They're not too keen on talking
to the law, that's for damn sure.

531
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,679
- Most don't even speak English.
- They speak English well enough.

532
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,270
This is a Gaelic-speaking region.
Did they not teach you that at Langley?

533
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,109
No, they did not teach me that
at Langley.

534
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:30,870
For the simple fact that Langley's
the CIA, you idiot, not the FBI.

535
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,516
You didn't know people in the west of
Ireland speak Gaelic and I'm the idiot?

536
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,039
Whatever.

537
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,755
- How was your day off?
- Energetic.

538
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,553
Something's come up.
I'm not talking about my cock.

539
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,877
One of my men's gone missing.
McBride.

540
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,788
I spotted his car in a known suicide
spot. He was on duty at the time.

541
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,673
- Any sign of foul play?
- Not as far as we know.

542
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,155
But you don't think it's suicide.
What, then?

543
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,477
First McCormick gets murdered,
now a guard disappears.

544
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,397
It's too much of a coincidence.

545
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,875
Could be he stumbled
onto something and got...?

546
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,309
- Whacked?
- Whacked, yeah.

547
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,916
His first day on the job in Connemara,
too. Talk about bad luck.

548
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,231
Yeah. But, er, where do we start?

549
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:24,196
I say we start with these two lads
and we take it from there.

550
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,309
<i>Slànte.</i>

551
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,280
That's Gaelic.

552
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,516
What's the first case you ever solved?

553
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,952
- Stealing an ostrich.
- What?

554
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:57,271
Guy stole an ostrich,
transported it across state lines.

555
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,119
Had something to do with the eggs
or something.

556
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,949
It's more original than dealing crack,
anyway. You ever have crack?

557
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,837
- Do you think I'd tell you if I had?
- I've had it.

558
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,549
Yet again, I don't think you should be
telling me these kinds of things.

559
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,752
They say if you have one hit
you're hooked, but that's shite.

560
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,438
It's propaganda for kids.

561
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,269
You certainly are an unconventional
police officer, Sergeant Boyle.

562
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,472
- Thank you.
- That was not meant as a compliment.

563
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,319
Ah, now, you're only messing,
I know that.

564
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,759
What's so fascinating?

565
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,631
Hmm.

566
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,957
I had what I thought was a crank call

567
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,674
saying the person responsible
for McCormick's death

568
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,677
was this lad Billy Devaney.

569
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,199
Oh.

570
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,756
- Which one's Devaney? The Italian?
- Yeah.

571
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,838
Devaney's alibi is that
he was in Hanley's on the night

572
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,632
battering Joey Brennan there.

573
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,797
- So?
- So I was thinking...

574
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:08,389
Maybe whoever made the crank call
was there on the night, saw Billy...

575
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:11,478
Saw Billy Devaney assaulting Brennan

576
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,876
and decided to throw him in the frame
for McCormick too.

577
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,677
Exactly.

578
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:25,553
Jesus, he gave him a hell of a clout.
Christ, he's strong for a little lad.

579
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,830
Whoa. Freeze it, freeze it.

580
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,399
- No, no, go back.
- Fuck.

581
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,919
Give it...

582
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:40,352
Goddamn, that's Sheehy and Cornell.

583
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,277
Look at it. They're here.

584
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:11,074
Like a donkey fucking
a hippopotamus, it's party time.

585
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,869
What?

586
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,152
Like a donkey fucking
a hippopotamus, it's party time.

587
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,551
- What the fuck are you on about?
- Sheehy said...

588
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,109
He was taking the piss,
for fuck's sake.

589
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,554
That's nice. Is that real leather?

590
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,471
Why, what am I, fucking cheap?

591
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,397
It's all there, yeah?

592
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:43,350
- Excuse me?
- It's all there?

593
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:46,153
No, it's not. I've skimmed
a couple of grand off the top.

594
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:49,113
- What?
- Course it's fucking all there.

595
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:53,028
This is the pay-off, yeah?
We pay you off,

596
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,789
you and your pals keep your
fucking noses out of our business.

597
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,480
That's the dynamic of this situation.

598
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:04,239
Why the fuck would I then cheat you
out your money? Eh?

599
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:07,397
Why would I do that?
That doesn't make any sense.

600
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:11,877
That'd defeat the entire purpose
of the fucking interaction. Fuck me!

601
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:20,278
Somebody got out of bed
the wrong side this morning.

602
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,755
Fuckin' Brits.

603
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,510
The big city boys.

604
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:36,314
But these are the three main ports?

605
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,510
Barna, Spiddal, Rossaveal.

606
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,949
OK, let's get three teams
in each of those places.

607
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,640
And I wanna move up and down
the coast, point by point.

608
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,910
Big map. People pointing.

609
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,837
Must be important.

610
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,917
I wanna move the teams up and down
the coast, point by point.

611
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,632
We'll do it in about 48 hours.

612
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,557
All happening now, huh?

613
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,352
Excuse me a moment.

614
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,070
Sorry, I didn't mean to insult...

615
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,794
Don't you ever fuckin' grab me
like that again.

616
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,309
Don't you ever speak to me
like that again.

617
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,954
You have your fuckin' zombies
around you now.

618
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:17,878
Mobile phones, computers.
Very fuckin' sophisticated.

619
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,356
We're working on a vitally important
case. What I need from you...

620
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:25,553
What do you need from me, Wendell,
apart from a cup of fuckin' coffee?

621
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,353
Boyle, some mad lad
wants to talk to ya.

622
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:32,109
His cat's probably stuck up a tree
or something.

623
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,996
You should probably take that.

624
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,872
So, logistically,
what we're gonna need is...

625
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,430
- Where is it?
- Beyond.

626
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:15,911
They didn't hide it very well. Sloppy.

627
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:20,312
Well, they were probably out here
after dark.

628
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:22,874
Be a lonely old job up here at night.

629
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,232
Yeah, probably ghosts up here
and everything. Poltergeists.

630
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,795
I don't know about the poltergeists.
There's nothing to peg around.

631
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,514
- What were you doing up here?
- Heroin.

632
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:38,997
You'll get a belt, Eugene,
if you carry on with that craic.

633
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:40,951
Give us a hand here.

634
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:55,311
- What?
- You've taken something.

635
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,237
- I have not.
- You've taken something.

636
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:59,078
You didn't even act surprised.

637
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,589
This is like the Birmingham Six
all over again!

638
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:04,473
Hand it over, you little shit.
Don't make me frisk ya.

639
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:07,831
You're trippin', nigga! If you frisk me,
I'll have you up on charges!

640
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,837
You want me to batter the hell
out of you?

641
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:12,030
Cos I will, boy. No questions asked.

642
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,476
What in hell are you doing?

643
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,317
- It's tiny.
- It's a Derringer.

644
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:29,319
John Wilkes Booth used one
to assassinate Abraham Lincoln.

645
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,476
Wouldn't think it'd do much damage.

646
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:35,673
They get the job done. But I can't see
what use they'd be to the 'RA.

647
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:38,712
Maybe they're for killing
little Protestants.

648
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:41,274
Killing little Protestants.
That's funny.

649
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,350
I fucking hate bent coppers.

650
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:49,678
- Did they try something?
- No, they didn't try something.

651
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,519
What's the problem, then?

652
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:56,315
I'm fucking tired of the kind
of people we have to deal with.

653
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:59,238
What d'ye expect?
We're drug traffickers.

654
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:04,948
Dalai Lama's hardly gonna be
looking for a piece of the action.

655
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,191
It's dispiriting, though, innit?

656
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:13,031
What's the point?

657
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,229
It's all so fucking meaningless.

658
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:18,794
- The money?
- The money, yeah.

659
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,710
How much money do you need
to be happy?

660
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:24,752
- The whores?
- The whores, yeah.

661
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,919
I'm at that stage where I'm looking
for a more meaningful relationship.

662
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,349
I'm with you there.

663
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:35,873
Monogamous.

664
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,913
There's one guard
Stanton couldn't vouch for.

665
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,792
Says he's too unpredictable.

666
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,798
Don't tell me. Let me guess. Boyle.

667
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,151
Yeah, that's him.

668
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:55,711
I like sharks.

669
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,951
They're soothing.

670
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,631
He was no use.

671
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,993
Sure, what have you got to confess,
at your age?

672
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,998
What's my age got to do with it?

673
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,588
Sure, Pol Pot was in his 70s
when he died.

674
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:28,518
I think Pol Pot's shenanigans
were a little more malicious

675
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,631
than anything you might've got up to.

676
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,796
Shows what you know.

677
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:35,992
Really? You took part in a sex orgy
or something, did ya?

678
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:38,839
- One of them bacchanals?
- Get away.

679
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,918
Or bust a cap in the ass of a homey?

680
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:48,757
So how are things
in the world of law enforcement?

681
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:53,715
- We've had a lad over from the FBI.
- Oh. The Behavioural Science Unit?

682
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,956
Drugs.

683
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:57,911
- Ah, sure.
- Yeah.

684
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:03,674
- What kind of drugs?
- Cocaine.

685
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:07,110
Cocaine?
I could do with some cocaine.

686
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,595
They say it gives you
great get-up-and-go.

687
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,438
Oh, it perks you up, all right.

688
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:14,950
Helps you get off with the lasses, too.
They're mad for the stuff.

689
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:17,799
- Who could blame them?
- True enough.

690
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,115
- What about amyl nitrate?
- What?

691
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:24,836
- What does amyl nitrate do for you?
- Am I a fucking drugs aficionado?

692
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,554
What's with the sudden interest?

693
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:31,275
I don't know.
I... I feel I've missed out.

694
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:35,550
- You missed out on amyl nitrate?
- Well, generally, I'm saying.

695
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,399
Ah, sure, we all fucking
missed out generally.

696
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,829
You're not alone there.

697
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:46,838
What's going on in that tiny little
brain of yours? Come on, tell me.

698
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:58,034
I was just thinking I haven't...
listened to music in a long time.

699
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:01,197
Live music, you know?
Like a ceilidh band.

700
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,833
If that's all,
I can sort something out for tonight.

701
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:08,157
- You will?
- Bound to be something good on.

702
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,474
It's not as if
you're that hard to please.

703
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,159
Yeah, that's what they said to me
at the orgy.

704
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:33,193
- You've been in the wars, huh?
- Yeah.

705
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:36,437
- Who did that to ya?
- Just a fella.

706
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:39,233
Just a fella. Not a very nice fella.

707
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,076
There are no nice fellas.

708
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,714
Oh, I wouldn't be too sure
about that, now.

709
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,556
That's a very pessimistic world-view.

710
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:56,440
Two more of them, please, Yuyang.
Chocolate.

711
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:00,870
What brings you back to Galway,
Aoife? Nothing good, I'm betting.

712
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,070
It's about those pictures.

713
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:06,076
- What pictures?
- The ones from the G.

714
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,355
What about them?

715
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:18,314
I'm to tell you to keep your head down,
if you know what's good for you.

716
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,908
And if I don't keep me head down,
what then?

717
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,472
Are we making any headway?

718
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:35,911
- Sheehy.
- Sergeant Boyle.

719
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:39,149
So it was a set-up from the start?

720
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,953
- How'd you work that?
- No, it was just a random thing.

721
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:45,117
Heard there was a guard in Galway
with a penchant for whores.

722
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:50,155
Decided to take advantage of it.
Totally opportunistic on my part.

723
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:52,510
This song really freaks me out, man.

724
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:55,313
What did they throw off
the fucking Tallahatchie Bridge?

725
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,989
- I always thought it was a baby.
- Yeah?

726
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:01,714
Could be a gun.
Well, could be any fuckin' thing.

727
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:04,798
Bobbie Gentry said
she didn't know what it was.

728
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:06,672
Supposed to be mysterious, like.

729
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,711
It gives me the fuckin' creeps.

730
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:11,798
You know what gives me the creeps?
Cunts who beat up women.

731
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:15,913
Ah, that wasn't me, now. It was one
of me overenthusiastic minions.

732
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:19,316
- Cornell or O'Leary?
- You're very well informed, Sergeant.

733
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:23,149
- I keep abreast of current events.
- Good man yourself.

734
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,669
No, I'm not a fan of violence
against women

735
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:28,598
and I'm not a fan of blackmail either.

736
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:31,188
So, er, as an added incentive...

737
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:35,159
- Now...
- What's the point in paying me off?

738
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:38,078
You'll have to pay off
every other guard on the west coast.

739
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:45,991
- The lot of them?
- Enough as makes no odds.

740
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:48,680
- Even Wendell?
- Who's... Oh, the Yank?

741
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:52,156
No, I decided that discretion
was the better part of valour there.

742
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:56,558
You know what the Americans are like
with their fuckin' ideals.

743
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:01,399
I'll say this now, so as we're clear.
This is a one-time-only offer.

744
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:06,071
Cross me on this and you're finished.
And this is not just about me.

745
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:09,795
You can't just arrest me and it's over.
There are men behind the men.

746
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,510
Do you understand?

747
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,110
I understand, Sheehy.

748
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:29,439
I understand.

749
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:32,954
Good.

750
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,590
Goodbye, amigos.

751
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:42,796
Are you all right?

752
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:46,196
That milkshake's after giving me
a fuckin' milkshake headache.

753
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,515
Oh, I hate them.

754
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:56,833
- What are you gonna do?
- I'll be alright. It'll go in a minute.

755
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:02,432
¶ And drop them into the muddy
water off the Tallahatchie Bridge ¶

756
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:09,348
You know when you about someone
being liquidated by the Mob?

757
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:12,677
- Hmm.
- What does that actually mean?

758
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:16,591
Means they've been killed.
I mean, what else would it mean?

759
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:21,555
I know that. But does it mean they've
actually been turned into liquid?

760
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,352
Turned into liquid.

761
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:33,632
No. Just... killed.

762
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:38,236
Suppose turning someone into liquid
would be too time-consuming, huh?

763
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:40,078
Take ages.

764
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:47,308
Ah. Mrs McBride.

765
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,635
- You've found him?
- No, I'm sorry.

766
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,069
We just wanted to ask you
a few more questions.

767
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,112
- Please.
- I thought Sergeant Boyle was...

768
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:57,595
- He's been relieved of those duties.
- Why?

769
00:56:57,720 --> 00:57:01,235
- There was a jurisdictional issue.
- He's not right in the head.

770
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:05,478
I don't think we need to involve
Mrs McBride in that discussion, do you?

771
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:08,068
Right you are.
You know more than me.

772
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:13,557
I'm sorry. We were wondering if there
was any reason you could think of

773
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,433
that your husband might have
chosen to disappear.

774
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:19,996
- No. I told Sergeant Boyle all I know.
- No, I understand.

775
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:23,795
- Was he on the take?
- I... I don't understand...

776
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,753
McBride. Was he taking money
from people? Gangsters?

777
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,871
- Whoa!
- He is a good man. Why would he...?

778
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,117
- No, no. Of course he's a good man.
- Ah, sure, we're all good men.

779
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,800
The fact remains,
he shows up in the west

780
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:37,514
at the exact same time
a bunch of drug smugglers

781
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:40,313
are landing half a billion dollars'
worth of cocaine

782
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:42,396
and then he suddenly goes missing?

783
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:45,034
- Hmm, sounds fishy to me.
- Inspector Stanton!

784
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:47,913
- You're saying he is a criminal?
- No, we're not...

785
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:50,349
Many a blind eye be turned
for that money.

786
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,198
- He is from Dublin after all.
- Oh!

787
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:55,232
I thought you wanted to find
my husband, but you insult him?

788
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:59,148
Mrs McBride, I would like to sincerely
apologise for the insensitivity...

789
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:03,068
I will only speak to Sergeant Boyle.
Please do not come to my work again.

790
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,679
- Mrs Mc...
- Good day to you.

791
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,677
Mrs McBride, if I could...

792
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:11,519
Hmm! Touchy, huh?

793
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,870
They're like that, the Romanians.

794
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:34,237
- Sergeant.
- Colum.

795
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,032
D'you want one of these?

796
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:41,196
- What are they?
- I dunno.

797
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:44,437
Libyan lad gave them to me.
All different colours, look.

798
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:46,676
I'll pass, Colum.

799
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:50,909
I'll have one of the purple ones.
They make you feel frisky.

800
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:55,118
Right. We'll have a little look-see
for ourselves.

801
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:00,672
- Who found 'em?
- Young lad.

802
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:06,034
- We won't have any trouble there?
- No, he's a good lad.

803
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:10,039
He's a bit cracked, anyways, so, like,
even if he did say something...

804
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:14,676
- Is that the lot, yeah?
- Yeah. What's the problem?

805
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:17,473
There's supposed to be
two of those Kalashnikovs

806
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,556
and two Glocks, and a Derringer.

807
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:22,478
- What's a Derringer?
- It's like a baby gun.

808
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:28,232
One of the gay lads used to like
secreting it on his person, you know.

809
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:32,319
- There were gay lads in the IRA?
- There are one or two, like.

810
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:35,477
It was the only way we could
successfully infiltrate the Ml5.

811
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,593
What?

812
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:43,915
I mean, an AK-47,
a Glock and a Derringer.

813
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:45,837
That's a lot to go missing, like.

814
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,830
Have you any idea
what happened to them?

815
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,996
- Maybe the mice ate them.
- Huh?

816
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:56,111
Maybe the mice ate them.

817
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:59,676
I can't be after putting that in
me report. "Maybe the mice ate them".

818
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:02,473
- No?
- Not really, no.

819
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,112
Why don't you put in your report

820
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:07,754
that Sergeant Boyle
went out of his fuckin' way

821
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:11,668
to do you boys a fuckin' favour,
and he got really fuckin' annoyed

822
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:16,191
when you started asking him stupid
questions about missing fuckin' guns,

823
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:20,313
and trying to fuckin' catch him out
as if he was some fuckin' gobshite?

824
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:23,193
- No need for that.
- You have your explosives, don't ya?

825
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:27,199
It's not as if you lads were ever keen
on getting in close for a scrap, now.

826
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:29,834
Blowing up Australians by mistake
from a distance

827
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:32,030
was more your modus operandi.

828
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:35,311
There's no need for that.
I'm after upsetting you.

829
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:38,432
I apologise.
Now can we leave it at that?

830
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:43,314
I accept your apology, Colum.

831
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:47,115
You boys owe me one, though.
For going out of me way.

832
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:49,913
I'll have to put it
to the high command.

833
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:53,396
- Is there still a high command?
- There is, yeah.

834
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:56,717
Well, I can't ask fairer than that.

835
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,232
Ta.

836
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,671
The boot's at the other end, Colum.

837
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,757
Jesus.

838
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:14,798
I'm always doing that.

839
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:25,237
Nothing.

840
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:29,035
Tomorrow night, so. We're good to go.

841
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,316
- I fuckin' hate that.
- What?

842
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:35,715
Americanisms.

843
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,671
"Good to go".

844
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:45,630
What about the guard?

845
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:48,194
I don't know.
That's an anomaly.

846
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:50,436
Is that the right word?
I don't think it is.

847
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:52,630
Why? The guard, I mean.

848
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:56,639
The blackmail didn't bother
him and he didn't take the money.

849
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:00,150
- I'm impressed.
- I was, too, I have to say.

850
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:02,157
Yeah, good luck to him.

851
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:06,751
It's not often you come across
that kind of integrity in our business.

852
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,314
- Still...
- Yeah, we can't have that.

853
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,035
We'll have to make sure
he's out of harm's way.

854
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:15,914
- Why's it always me, though?
- Cos you're a psychopath.

855
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:19,669
I'm a sociopath, not a psychopath.
They explained that to me in Mountjoy.

856
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:24,476
- What's the difference?
- Dunno. It's a tricky one.

857
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:38,470
So... what did Dr Oleyuwo
say to you?

858
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,751
Sure, what could he say?

859
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:45,714
He won't be happy.
Me out gallivanting.

860
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:48,434
I told him I'd have him deported
if he made trouble.

861
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:50,994
Oh, you're a terror.

862
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:01,276
You OK?

863
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:03,755
Thanks for taking me out, Gerry.

864
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:05,836
You're a good boy.
Always a good boy.

865
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:07,712
Oh, stop it.

866
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:11,469
No, you never gave me
a moment's grief.

867
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:14,876
Ah, now stop. Now we both know
that's not true.

868
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:24,391
Let's pretend that it is.

869
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:34,077
Lovely music, huh?

870
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,916
We checked the dispensary.

871
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:53,192
There was nothing missing,
as far as we could tell.

872
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:57,628
She probably
saved 'em up herself.

873
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:01,433
She was always crafty like that.

874
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:04,518
She did not leave a note.

875
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,790
She didn't have
to leave a note.

876
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:11,790
What needed to be said?

877
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:22,591
She was a proud woman.

878
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:26,111
She was a brave woman.

879
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:29,591
She was my mother.

880
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:47,719
Thank you.

881
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:16,189
I was sorry to hear about your mother.

882
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:22,313
You know,
I lost my father a few years ago.

883
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:27,591
Didn't really hit me at the time.
It was only later that I...

884
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:35,712
It's tough, all right.

885
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,279
Yeah.

886
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:42,191
Yeah, it is.

887
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:51,397
So what's happening?

888
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,511
With the investigation?

889
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:58,430
Oh. Well, reliable intelligence
says they're down in Cork now.

890
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:01,028
- Who's down in Cork?
- Cornell, Sheehy and O'Leary.

891
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:04,152
- Where's this intelligence from?
- Garda sources.

892
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:06,111
- Garda sources?
- Yeah.

893
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:08,310
The Naval Service
will stand down here.

894
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:10,510
We'll concentrate the operation
in Cork.

895
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:14,030
- So you're moving on?
- Yeah.

896
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:16,799
There's another agent
in place down there already.

897
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:18,751
I'll be heading out tonight.

898
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:26,753
I wanna thank you for all your help.
Really. It's much appreciated.

899
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:35,594
Well...

900
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:44,151
Take care of yourself, now, Wendell.

901
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:48,637
I will.

902
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:51,790
- Good luck.
- I'll see you.

903
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:21,953
¶ I make a date for golf...

904
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:42,311
¶ Everything happens to me

905
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:48,032
¶ At first my heart thought...

906
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:52,312
No, leave it. I like Chet Baker.

907
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:57,517
You should get a dog.
Or a parrot, maybe.

908
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,995
Something to raise the alarm,
you know.

909
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:02,031
Ned Kelly had a peacock.

910
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:04,196
I've always wanted a giraffe.

911
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:06,629
A giraffe?

912
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:09,715
That wouldn't work. I mean...

913
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:12,676
You'd have to put in a cupola
or somethin'.

914
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:15,750
Be too expensive.

915
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:19,479
Sit yourself down there now.

916
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:30,792
Thought you lads were
supposed to be down in Cork.

917
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:34,071
It's called misinformation
in the intelligence community.

918
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:37,397
- Disinformation.
- Disinformation, then, smartarse.

919
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:40,796
- You're down at Rossaveal, so?
- Close. Spiddal.

920
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:47,073
You know, I don't know whether
to kill you or just tie you up,

921
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:49,839
make sure you don't do anythin' silly.

922
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:52,269
D'you have any rope and, er,

923
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:55,551
what d'you call it?
Erm, masking tape?

924
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:57,716
There might be some
down in the shed below.

925
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:02,675
Ah, sure. Can't be traipsing round
out there at this hour of the night.

926
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:06,030
You couldn't just let me be, no?

927
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:13,399
Why d'you kill McCormick,
if you don't mind me asking?

928
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:17,229
- We thought he was an FBI informer.
- Thought he was an FBI informer?

929
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:22,115
- Turns out he wasn't.
- Unlucky for Mr McCormick.

930
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:25,152
Better to be safe than sorry,
though, huh?

931
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:28,033
Right enough. Can't be too careful
in your line of work.

932
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:31,630
It's a hard life.
Not a lot of people understand.

933
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:37,039
I'm on tablets, like,
for the stress. Lithium.

934
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:40,874
You want to be careful with that stuff.

935
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:44,516
You all right there?

936
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:47,916
I think I might have picked up
a little something I shouldn't have.

937
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:50,156
Got a little fungi from Dingle, huh?

938
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:54,714
I was with two lasses.
Got a bit carried away, like.

939
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:58,719
Ran out of the old prophylactics
but decided to chance it?

940
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:00,876
We've all been there.

941
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,639
- Where were these girls from?
- Dublin.

942
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:06,433
Sure, Dublin.
You've only yourself to blame.

943
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:19,193
Be nice if we had some dips.
While you're making up your mind.

944
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:23,154
Yeah. Some nachos. Guacamole.

945
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:27,831
- I mean, we might be here a while.
- Nah, we won't be here that long.

946
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:30,190
This'll all be over soon.

947
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:36,229
- What was the deal with McCormick?
- Just to confuse you lads.

948
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:39,039
Why "5½", though?

949
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:41,071
Fuck knows. I was locked, sure.

950
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,592
Oh, Christ.

951
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,916
They're eating you alive, the beggars.

952
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:51,429
And McBride? You did for him, too?

953
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:53,790
Now that was pure happenstance.
Hmm.

954
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:57,595
He pulled us over for no reason.
Should've minded his own business.

955
01:10:57,720 --> 01:11:01,429
- What did you do with the body?
- Dumped it in the sea.

956
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:04,518
Little fishes will have
eaten him away by now.

957
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:08,792
Not bad, huh?
Getting away with two murders?

958
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:12,910
You haven't got away with them yet.

959
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,914
I admire your confidence, Sergeant.

960
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:21,678
I admire yours.

961
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:27,279
Fuck.

962
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:33,399
I think... I think you've done for me.

963
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,317
I think I have, yeah.

964
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:41,431
Are the lights growing dim?

965
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:45,838
- Don't mock me.
- It's good enough for ye.

966
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:49,437
There were so many...

967
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:56,518
There were so many things...
I wanted to do.

968
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:01,829
Like what, for fuck's sake?
Running with the bulls at Pamplona?

969
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:09,117
Special Agent Wendell Everett.

970
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:12,152
- It's Gerry Boyle, Wendell.
- Hey, Sergeant, what's up?

971
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:15,590
- Where are ye?
- I'm almost into Galway now.

972
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:20,191
You gotta get back. They're landing
at Spiddal tonight. Cork is a decoy.

973
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:25,036
Look, I know that you've had a lot
of fun batting around the American.

974
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:29,358
No, it's not a joke.
I'm after running into O'Leary.

975
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:33,632
- You ran into O'Leary?
- Well, he ran into me. I shot him.

976
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:35,751
- You shot him?
- In self-defence.

977
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:39,634
- Is he dead?
- Hang on.

978
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:51,080
- He is now, yeah.
- No.

979
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:54,397
No, it can't be right. It's Cork.
They're coming into Cork.

980
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:57,789
Well, you know best. I'll see ya.

981
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:03,312
Idiot.

982
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:31,158
- He's dead?
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure of it.

983
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:34,636
- Did he kill himself?
- No.

984
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:38,150
- He was murdered.
- He was murdered?

985
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:41,875
Yeah, they shot him, I think,
and threw him into the sea.

986
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,594
I finished off
one of the lads that did it.

987
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:47,188
I have to go down now
and sort out the others.

988
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:51,154
- What are you talking about?
- No, I just... I just wanted to say

989
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:55,592
I'm sorry I didn't get to know you
better. You're a lovely woman.

990
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:59,791
See ya.

991
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:03,514
Gerry?

992
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:07,358
Gerry!

993
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:52,113
He's taking his time,
for fuck's sake.

994
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:56,119
Yeah. Thought he'd got over
his predilection for torture.

995
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:02,470
I'm not sure you ever get over
something like that.

996
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:05,592
- How do you mean?
- It's not like it's a hobby, is it?

997
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:08,712
It's more of a psychological hang-up.

998
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,358
I suppose.

999
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:24,678
God, those hookers'll be
the death of me.

1000
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:33,435
Don't fuckin' drop any of those.

1001
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:37,914
Where the fuck
did you find those three?

1002
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:42,352
Oh, I put an ad in the paper saying,
"Henchmen wanted".

1003
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:11,153
- What did I tell you?
- I'm here, aren't I?

1004
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:13,316
Good man yourself.

1005
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:17,672
- OK, I called for backup. So...
- Why?

1006
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:21,315
Why? Cos if we don't have backup
we're both gonna die, that's why.

1007
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:23,476
Nobody will come.
It's just you and me.

1008
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:27,832
- What the hell are you talking about?
- You know what I'm talking about.

1009
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:30,076
But they wouldn't just...

1010
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:32,236
I mean, they're not just gonna...

1011
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:34,999
Half a billion, Wendell.
That's half a billion.

1012
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,231
It's just you and me.

1013
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:43,079
- Shit.
- That's right.

1014
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:48,515
I suppose that's what accounts
for this monstrosity right here.

1015
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:50,278
- That's for you.
- What?

1016
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:53,676
Come on, you can't shoot
a Kalashnikov in the middle of Ireland.

1017
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:55,756
Be an international fucking incident.

1018
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:58,678
You have to. I'll need covering fire.

1019
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:00,677
Covering fire for what?

1020
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:03,272
I'm going to arrest those lads

1021
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:06,153
for the murders of James McCormick
and Aidan McBride

1022
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:09,033
and on the lesser charge
of smuggling cocaine.

1023
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:11,435
- Yes, Wendell?
- Point I'd like to make.

1024
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:14,358
It's fucking suicide.

1025
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:19,838
I know. Even if I get away with it,
the big boys'll be after me.

1026
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:21,678
I'll have no fuckin' peace.

1027
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:24,917
It's all right for you. You can go
to the States. Where can I go?

1028
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:28,589
That's the trouble with the Irish,
Wendell. They never forget.

1029
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:31,188
But I'm still going to go down there,
anyways.

1030
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:35,029
Now, I know what you're thinking.

1031
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:38,072
You're thinking, those men
are armed and dangerous.

1032
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:39,519
You being an FBI agent,

1033
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:42,598
you're more used to shooting
at unarmed women and children.

1034
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:44,711
Fuck you, Sergeant!

1035
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:49,311
Are you gonna help me or not?

1036
01:18:57,480 --> 01:19:00,074
- Have you ever been shot before?
- Yeah.

1037
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:03,676
Does it hurt?

1038
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:06,553
Does it hu...?
No, it doesn't hurt! It's kind...

1039
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:08,989
Yeah, it hurts!
What the fuck do you think?

1040
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:11,839
You got any more ammo
for this thing or what?

1041
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:15,229
They say that the shock
counteracts the pain.

1042
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:17,794
- Who are "they"?
- I don't know. I'm just saying.

1043
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:20,070
It hurts, all right?

1044
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:22,191
It fuckin' hurts like hell, man.

1045
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:24,550
- Oh, shit.
- That's right.

1046
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:30,234
Right.

1047
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:37,357
How many times have you been shot?

1048
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:40,597
- Three times.
- Three times? Jesus.

1049
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:43,280
You must be getting used to it
by now, then, huh?

1050
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:48,359
- Anybody you want me to call if you...
- Nah. I don't have anybody.

1051
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:51,677
Just pin a medal to me body, like
those lads coming home from Iraq.

1052
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:55,349
- Fuck you again, Sergeant.
- Thanks for coming to help, Wendell.

1053
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:57,277
I appreciate it.

1054
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,916
See ya.

1055
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:35,715
- Oh, you gotta be fucking joking.
- It's the guard!

1056
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,990
I'm here for Sheehy and Cornell!

1057
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:40,634
The rest of you can go,
if you've a mind to!

1058
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:44,712
I'll take that as a no.

1059
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:53,995
Let's get the fuck out of here, Clive!

1060
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:58,716
Are you kidding me? This is better
than fuckin' Christmas!

1061
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:00,193
What?

1062
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:18,315
Come on, move it out!

1063
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:22,559
Ah, fuck.

1064
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:37,074
Good shot.

1065
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:51,553
Flesh wound.

1066
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:09,316
Wait, wait, I give up! Me hole!

1067
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:22,675
- Aargh!
- Oh!

1068
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:35,879
Boyle!

1069
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:52,038
Boyle!

1070
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:15,559
Lucky shot.

1071
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:19,150
Ah, now, don't be a sore loser.

1072
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:22,158
Although it's not every day
you lose half a billion dollars.

1073
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:24,032
Two hundred million it was.

1074
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:28,350
They're always fuckin' overestimating.
Didn't I fuckin' know well?

1075
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:32,234
You don't know anything
about anything, you stupid little man.

1076
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:34,828
Ah, I think I did all right for meself.

1077
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:37,997
I did for you,
Francis Sheehy-Skeffington.

1078
01:23:38,120 --> 01:23:39,678
And your pals.

1079
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:42,155
Who was up there
firing that fuckin' cannon?

1080
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:44,430
The FBI lad.

1081
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:48,314
Probably hasn't had this much fun
since they burnt those kids at Waco.

1082
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:52,992
- Fuckin' O'Leary.
- He wasn't the sharpest all right.

1083
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:54,997
And the Englishman
wasn't much better.

1084
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:56,997
Colombians are more reliable.

1085
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:05,511
I'm not gonna beg you to help me,
if that's what you want.

1086
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:07,437
I know how to die.

1087
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:10,552
Good for you, Sheehy.

1088
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:15,477
Good for you. I'll see ya.

1089
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:18,712
Boyle!

1090
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:20,879
Boyle!

1091
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,991
Boyle!

1092
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:26,072
Boyle!

1093
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:29,957
Fuck.

1094
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:47,830
- You from the press?
- Oh, God, no.

1095
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:54,399
- Asshole.
- That's a good one now.

1096
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:56,238
Moody.

1097
01:24:56,360 --> 01:24:58,715
You can use it
for the cover of your book.

1098
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:00,239
What book?

1099
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:04,319
You yokes are always writing books
about your fuckin' experiences.

1100
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:08,115
Probably sell it to the movies, then.
A fish-out-of-water story, huh?

1101
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:09,673
Lots of action, bit of humour.

1102
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:12,951
Throw in some young ones getting
their kit off and you're well away.

1103
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:15,719
- Need a happy ending to sell it.
- Happy ending?

1104
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:19,196
Didn't you foil a multimillion-dollar
drug-trafficking operation

1105
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:23,279
and knock off a trio of drug barons
to boot? What's unhappy about that?

1106
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:28,991
- Lost a good man.
- I wouldn't be sure about that, now.

1107
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:31,315
They never recovered a body,
did they?

1108
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:35,031
It's a big sea out there.

1109
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:40,399
He's dead.
Either burned up or drowned.

1110
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:43,630
But he was
a really good swimmer.

1111
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:49,032
I'm sorry, son, that was just bullshit.
He was never in the Olympics.

1112
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:53,517
Well, maybe so. Sure,
it's easy enough to look up, anyways.

1113
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:16,194
You know, I can't tell
if you're really motherfucking dumb

1114
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,197
or really motherfucking smart.

1115
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:33,750
¶ All my bags are packed,
I'm ready to go

1116
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:37,156
¶ I'm standing here outside your door

1117
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:39,748
¶ I hate to wake you up

1118
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:44,192
¶ To say goodbye

1119
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:45,958
¶ But the dawn is breaking

1120
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:47,752
¶ It's early morn

1121
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:51,350
¶ The taxi's waiting,
he's blowing his horn

1122
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:57,669
¶ Already I'm so lonesome I could die

1123
01:26:57,800 --> 01:27:01,588
¶ So kiss me and smile for me

1124
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:05,315
¶ Tell me that you'll wait for me

1125
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:11,549
¶ Hold me like you'll never let me go

1126
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:16,071
¶ Cos I'm leaving on a jet plane

1127
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:20,751
¶ Don't know when I'll be back again

1128
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:28,070
¶ Oh, babe, I hate to go

1129
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:32,797
¶ There's so many times
I've let you down

1130
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:36,833
¶ So many times I've played around

1131
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,439
¶ I tell you now

1132
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:43,111
¶ They don't mean a thing

1133
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:46,710
¶ Every place I go I'll think of you

1134
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:49,718
¶ Every song I sing, I'll sing for you

1135
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:52,070
¶ When I come back

1136
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:56,751
¶ I'll bring your wedding ring

1137
01:27:56,880 --> 01:28:00,759
¶ So kiss me and smile for me

1138
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:04,236
¶ Tell me that you'll wait for me

1139
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:10,674
¶ Hold me like you'll never let me go

1140
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:15,237
¶ Cos I'm leaving on a jet plane

1141
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:19,433
¶ Don't know when I'll be back again

1142
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:26,272
¶ Oh, babe, I hate to go

1143
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:32,669
¶ Now the time has come
to leave you

1144
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:36,076
¶ One more time let me kiss you

1145
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:42,833
¶ Then close your eyes
and I'll be on my way

1146
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:46,157
¶ Dream about the days to come

1147
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:49,556
¶ When I won't have to leave alone

1148
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:56,870
¶ About the times I won't have to say

1149
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:00,834
¶ Kiss me and smile for me

1150
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:03,713
¶ Tell me that you'll wait for me

1151
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:10,234
¶ Hold me like you'll never let me go

1152
01:29:10,360 --> 01:29:14,797
¶ Cos I'm leaving on a jet plane

1153
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:18,356
¶ Don't know when I'll be back again

1154
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:24,029
¶ Oh, babe, I hate to go

1155
01:29:24,160 --> 01:29:28,676
¶ I'm leaving on a jet plane

1156
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:33,316
