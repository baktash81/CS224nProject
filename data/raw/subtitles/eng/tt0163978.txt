1
00:00:38,061 --> 00:00:40,147
My name is Richard.

2
00:00:42,316 --> 00:00:44,401
So what else do
you need to know?

3
00:00:44,484 --> 00:00:47,029
Stuff about my family
or where I'm from?

4
00:00:47,696 --> 00:00:49,781
None of that matters.

5
00:00:51,325 --> 00:00:54,745
Not once you cross the ocean
and cut yourself loose...

6
00:00:54,828 --> 00:00:58,999
...looking for something more beautiful,
something more exciting...

7
00:00:59,082 --> 00:01:02,127
...and yes, I admit,
something more dangerous.

8
00:01:03,462 --> 00:01:06,340
So after 18 hours in
the back of an airplane...

9
00:01:06,423 --> 00:01:11,011
...three dumb movies, two plastic meals,
six beers and absolutely no sleep...

10
00:01:11,094 --> 00:01:13,055
...I finally touch down...

11
00:01:13,138 --> 00:01:15,641
- Hey, you! How about you?
- ..in Bangkok.

12
00:01:15,766 --> 00:01:18,560
Do you want to go to the waterfall?
Floating market!

13
00:01:18,644 --> 00:01:20,771
1,500 THB. Cheap for you!
Come on! Hey!

14
00:01:21,355 --> 00:01:23,440
Hey! Do you need
somewhere to stay?

15
00:01:23,523 --> 00:01:26,401
- I'll find my own place, thanks.
- What you want, man?

16
00:01:26,485 --> 00:01:28,820
And this is it. Bangkok.

17
00:01:28,904 --> 00:01:30,989
Good-time city.

18
00:01:31,073 --> 00:01:33,158
Gateway to Southeast Asia.

19
00:01:33,241 --> 00:01:38,121
Where dollars and Deutschmarks get turned
into counterfeit watches and genuine scars.

20
00:01:38,205 --> 00:01:40,707
Good time! Boy! Girl!
Fucking! No problem!

21
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:44,836
- This is where the hungry come to feed.
- You wanna drink snake blood?

22
00:01:45,712 --> 00:01:47,881
Wait a minute.
Did you say snake blood?

23
00:01:47,964 --> 00:01:50,050
Oh, yeah!

24
00:01:51,051 --> 00:01:53,637
- No, thanks.
- What is wrong with snake blood?

25
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,724
- I just... don't like the idea.
- Maybe you're scared.

26
00:01:57,808 --> 00:02:00,644
- Afraid of something new.
- I just don't like the idea.

27
00:02:00,727 --> 00:02:02,562
Like every tourist!

28
00:02:02,688 --> 00:02:04,773
You want it all be safe.

29
00:02:04,856 --> 00:02:06,942
Just like America!

30
00:02:09,903 --> 00:02:11,905
So never refuse an invitation.

31
00:02:13,532 --> 00:02:16,660
Never resist the unfamiliar.

32
00:02:32,384 --> 00:02:34,469
Never fail to be polite.

33
00:02:34,553 --> 00:02:36,513
Gentlemen...

34
00:02:36,596 --> 00:02:38,682
...that was excellent.

35
00:02:38,765 --> 00:02:40,851
And never outstay your welcome.

36
00:02:42,561 --> 00:02:46,022
Just keep your mind open
and suck in the experience.

37
00:02:46,898 --> 00:02:48,984
And if it hurts...

38
00:02:49,067 --> 00:02:51,153
...it's probably worth it.

39
00:02:52,821 --> 00:02:54,072
Hey.

40
00:02:54,156 --> 00:02:56,241
- Good evening.
- Hi.

41
00:02:56,324 --> 00:02:58,618
- Can I get a room, please?
- Yes.

42
00:03:15,552 --> 00:03:18,722
The only downer is,
everyone's got the same idea.

43
00:03:18,805 --> 00:03:20,932
We all travel thousands of miles...

44
00:03:20,974 --> 00:03:25,228
...just to watch TV and check into
somewhere with all the comforts of home.

45
00:03:26,313 --> 00:03:28,398
And you gotta ask yourself...

46
00:03:28,481 --> 00:03:32,402
We'll have this place cleaned up
in a jiffy, so don't you worry!

47
00:03:32,485 --> 00:03:34,571
...what is the point of that?

48
00:04:14,736 --> 00:04:16,821
- Et voila!
- Thank you.

49
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,199
Bonsoir.

50
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,910
Bonsoir.

51
00:04:22,577 --> 00:04:24,704
Good night.

52
00:04:25,622 --> 00:04:27,916
And as for traveling alone...

53
00:04:27,999 --> 00:04:29,793
...fuck it!

54
00:04:29,876 --> 00:04:33,463
If that's the way it has to be,
then that's the way it is.

55
00:04:58,196 --> 00:05:01,491
Everybody happy?!

56
00:05:03,785 --> 00:05:05,954
Everybody having a good time, eh?

57
00:05:06,037 --> 00:05:08,123
Fuck you! Fuck you!

58
00:05:08,206 --> 00:05:10,291
Please shut up, OK?

59
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,460
Bastard parasites!

60
00:05:12,544 --> 00:05:14,129
Viruses!

61
00:05:14,963 --> 00:05:17,090
That's fuckin' great! Cancers!

62
00:05:17,132 --> 00:05:19,217
Bastard cancers!

63
00:05:26,933 --> 00:05:31,646
A big, chunky Charlie that's eatin'
up the whole fuckin' world!

64
00:05:35,734 --> 00:05:37,819
Hey!

65
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:40,405
Hey, you!

66
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,247
- You got anything to smoke?
- No, I don't have anything to smoke!

67
00:05:51,332 --> 00:05:53,418
That's no problem, pal, cos, er...

68
00:05:53,501 --> 00:05:56,546
...I've got loads of the fuckin' stuff.

69
00:06:13,062 --> 00:06:15,231
Do ya understand what I'm sayin'?

70
00:06:15,315 --> 00:06:16,900
Yeah.

71
00:06:17,609 --> 00:06:19,277
No, you don't.

72
00:06:20,862 --> 00:06:23,072
No, you're right. I don't.

73
00:06:26,075 --> 00:06:28,161
Ahh, that's better!

74
00:06:32,582 --> 00:06:34,667
Thanks.

75
00:06:35,752 --> 00:06:37,921
It was the beach.
You understand?

76
00:06:39,172 --> 00:06:42,133
The beach. It was too...

77
00:06:42,717 --> 00:06:47,847
...beautiful. Too much input, too much...
sensation. I try to keep it under control...

78
00:06:47,931 --> 00:06:52,101
...but it just keeps spilling out
and spilling out and spilling out.

79
00:06:53,937 --> 00:06:56,022
You see, erm...

80
00:06:56,105 --> 00:06:58,191
...she's on an island.

81
00:06:59,651 --> 00:07:02,445
And the island is... is perfect.

82
00:07:02,528 --> 00:07:05,740
I mean... I mean,
real perfection here.

83
00:07:05,823 --> 00:07:09,285
I'm not just talking about...
"Oh, that's nice."

84
00:07:10,828 --> 00:07:12,914
It's the real fuckin' deal, OK?

85
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,168
It's perfect.

86
00:07:17,293 --> 00:07:20,088
See, it's like a... a lagoon.

87
00:07:20,171 --> 00:07:22,257
Ya know, a tidal... lagoon.

88
00:07:22,382 --> 00:07:24,425
See, it's sealed in by cliffs.

89
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:27,470
Totally fuckin' secret, totally fuckin'...

90
00:07:27,553 --> 00:07:29,639
...forbidden.

91
00:07:29,722 --> 00:07:31,683
And nobody can ever, ever...

92
00:07:31,766 --> 00:07:33,851
...ever, ever go there. Ever.

93
00:07:35,728 --> 00:07:37,647
But a few people went...

94
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:39,983
...once upon a time.

95
00:07:40,066 --> 00:07:43,152
Men and women with ideals.
You understand?

96
00:07:43,236 --> 00:07:47,615
I'm not just talking about the usual...
travelin' fuckin' wanks.

97
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,785
Do you believe in that place?

98
00:07:51,703 --> 00:07:53,746
No.

99
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:57,250
But I guess you're gonna tell
me that I should, right?

100
00:08:02,422 --> 00:08:05,550
It does not fuckin' matter
what I think any more.

101
00:08:05,633 --> 00:08:07,719
It's up to you.

102
00:08:09,178 --> 00:08:11,347
Ideals, eh?

103
00:08:11,431 --> 00:08:13,641
We were just fuckin' parasites!

104
00:08:13,725 --> 00:08:16,227
The big, chunky Charlie!

105
00:08:21,107 --> 00:08:23,192
See, I was the one...

106
00:08:23,276 --> 00:08:27,280
...that was trying to find the cure.
Procurer of the cure.

107
00:08:28,781 --> 00:08:31,117
I said to them
"You've got to leave."

108
00:08:31,701 --> 00:08:34,662
"You've got to leave this place."

109
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:38,499
But they would not listen.

110
00:08:42,462 --> 00:08:45,256
No offense an' all, but...

111
00:08:46,382 --> 00:08:49,010
...you're fucked in the head, right?

112
00:09:03,274 --> 00:09:05,359
Here, Richard.

113
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,948
It's been nice knowin' you, man.

114
00:09:12,867 --> 00:09:14,952
Yeah. You, too.

115
00:09:41,145 --> 00:09:43,856
Be careful! Electric... Electricity!

116
00:09:45,691 --> 00:09:49,070
- Ma'am! Ma'am!
- Chill, man!

117
00:09:49,153 --> 00:09:51,280
No worry!

118
00:09:58,663 --> 00:10:00,456
Hey! Man.

119
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,625
There is a letter for you.

120
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,585
A what?

121
00:10:04,669 --> 00:10:06,546
Letter on your door.

122
00:10:29,777 --> 00:10:31,862
No fuckin' way!

123
00:10:34,532 --> 00:10:36,075
Do you...

124
00:10:52,967 --> 00:10:55,052
Hello?

125
00:11:29,336 --> 00:11:31,422
You hope...

126
00:11:32,089 --> 00:11:34,008
...and you dream...

127
00:11:35,468 --> 00:11:39,013
...but you never believe that
something's gonna happen for you.

128
00:11:40,598 --> 00:11:42,683
Not like it does in the movies.

129
00:11:45,895 --> 00:11:47,980
And when it actually does...

130
00:11:49,857 --> 00:11:51,942
...you want it to feel different.

131
00:11:54,653 --> 00:11:57,156
More visceral.

132
00:11:57,239 --> 00:11:59,700
More real.

133
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,752
I was waiting for it to hit me.

134
00:12:13,297 --> 00:12:15,382
But it just wouldn't happen.

135
00:12:16,175 --> 00:12:18,260
The name of Mr. Daffy Duck.

136
00:12:18,344 --> 00:12:20,429
Never Never Land.

137
00:12:20,513 --> 00:12:22,598
Gonna fuck up all the paperwork.

138
00:12:23,265 --> 00:12:28,521
The police were pissed because he was
traveling under a false passport.

139
00:12:28,604 --> 00:12:30,689
Go ahead, sign the statement.

140
00:12:39,031 --> 00:12:40,991
It's OK.

141
00:12:41,116 --> 00:12:45,371
It just say he cut his wrists;
already dead when you found him.

142
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:49,750
But they didn't ask me
about the map, so...

143
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,418
No problem.

144
00:12:51,502 --> 00:12:54,505
...I didn't tell 'em.

145
00:12:58,467 --> 00:13:00,553
You have a nice day.

146
00:13:07,226 --> 00:13:08,936
Good luck!

147
00:13:09,019 --> 00:13:11,105
Excuse me.

148
00:13:15,734 --> 00:13:17,820
Look... I mean...

149
00:13:19,405 --> 00:13:22,116
...this island may not actually even exist.

150
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:24,952
Even if it does, I don't know
if we can get there or not.

151
00:13:25,035 --> 00:13:27,955
I just wondered if you
wanted to come with me.

152
00:13:27,997 --> 00:13:30,082
That's all.

153
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:45,180
Hey! You wanna take a hike?

154
00:13:45,973 --> 00:13:48,058
Uh... a-a trip, a journey?

155
00:13:48,684 --> 00:13:50,769
With y-your girlfriend and me?

156
00:13:50,853 --> 00:13:53,147
I mean, the two of you
and me. Together.

157
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,816
- I-I'm talking about the secret isla-...
- Hi.

158
00:13:55,899 --> 00:13:57,234
Hi.

159
00:14:01,155 --> 00:14:04,950
I just feel like everyone tries
to do something different, but...

160
00:14:05,034 --> 00:14:07,453
...you always wind up doing the same thing.

161
00:14:10,998 --> 00:14:15,377
I realised that I had absolutely no idea
of how I was gonna get there.

162
00:14:17,588 --> 00:14:19,214
But Etienne...

163
00:14:19,298 --> 00:14:22,801
I mean, I have to hand it
to the guy. He was great.

164
00:14:22,926 --> 00:14:25,596
I mean, he organized
the whole thing; tickets...

165
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:28,015
...timetables, the whole damn trip.

166
00:14:28,098 --> 00:14:32,227
Bangkok to Surat Thani.
Surat Thani to Na Thon.

167
00:14:32,311 --> 00:14:34,396
Na Thon to Chaweng.

168
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,815
500 miles in 24 hours...

169
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:39,401
...at less than 400 baht.

170
00:14:40,235 --> 00:14:42,571
Trust me,
that's a very good deal.

171
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:50,329
We were headed for the great unknown.

172
00:14:50,412 --> 00:14:54,500
But to get there, we had to
follow the regular tourist trail.

It's arranged. Tomorrow
morning. 1800 baht.

181
00:15:28,617 --> 00:15:30,494
Ah, great man! Nice work!

182
00:15:30,577 --> 00:15:33,580
There is one problem.
He will not take us to the island.

183
00:15:33,664 --> 00:15:37,292
It's in the national park and
it's forbidden to go there. But...

184
00:15:38,043 --> 00:15:41,421
...we are allowed to travel to
this one to stay for one night.

185
00:15:41,505 --> 00:15:43,715
Yeah... No, see,
that's the wrong one.

186
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:45,884
Yeah, I know that.

187
00:15:45,968 --> 00:15:48,303
Right. But how do we get
from there to there?

188
00:15:48,387 --> 00:15:51,181
- We swim.
- We swim?

189
00:15:51,265 --> 00:15:54,893
Yeah. We leave our rucksacks
on this island and then we swim.

190
00:15:54,977 --> 00:15:59,106
- You can swim, can't you, Richard?
- Of course I can swim.

191
00:15:59,189 --> 00:16:02,651
- So no problem.
- So h-how far is it, though?

192
00:16:02,734 --> 00:16:04,903
I don't know.
One or two kilometers.

193
00:16:04,987 --> 00:16:09,116
- Cool. Cool... Not far at all
- Stop it, Richard. It will be worth it.

194
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,202
An adventure. And just...
the three of us.

195
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:21,628
Uh-oh.

196
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:25,632
"Can you swim?"

197
00:16:25,716 --> 00:16:30,512
"I can swim! Oh, yeah! I am French and
I have the beautiful girlfriend, too! Huh!"

198
00:16:33,473 --> 00:16:35,559
Great

199
00:16:35,642 --> 00:16:38,228
- Goddammit!
- Locked out, huh?

200
00:16:39,855 --> 00:16:41,940
Yeah.

201
00:16:43,442 --> 00:16:45,485
- Lost your key?
- Uh-huh.

202
00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:49,114
- Bummer!
- Yeah, bummer!

203
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:54,077
So, uh... you wanna
grab a beer or somethin'?

204
00:17:00,876 --> 00:17:04,796
- You're better off without her.
- Sammy, how the fuck would you know?!

205
00:17:04,838 --> 00:17:06,923
You've never even met her!

206
00:17:07,007 --> 00:17:10,510
I'm just tryin' to help the guy
through the dark times.

207
00:17:10,594 --> 00:17:13,305
- It's not a problem.
- You see, Zeph?

208
00:17:13,388 --> 00:17:16,683
- It's not a problem.
- Change the fuckin' subject.

209
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:22,272
All right. Let's talk about how you spend
an hour in front of the mirror every day.

210
00:17:22,356 --> 00:17:26,693
Oh, that's nice You know this guy?
He likes to wipe his ass with tree leaves.

211
00:17:26,777 --> 00:17:30,197
He thinks he's some sort of
jungle commando.

212
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,032
- Whatever.
- I swear to God!

213
00:17:32,115 --> 00:17:34,201
- Whatever.
- Damn!

214
00:17:34,326 --> 00:17:36,161
I presume...

215
00:17:36,244 --> 00:17:39,456
...you know the story
of the Kentucky fried mouse.

216
00:17:39,498 --> 00:17:41,208
Yeah.

217
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:43,377
Woman bites into a chicken leg...

218
00:17:43,502 --> 00:17:45,796
...and it turns out to be,
uh... a mouse.

219
00:17:45,879 --> 00:17:47,214
Right?

220
00:17:47,297 --> 00:17:49,382
It's an urban myth.

221
00:17:50,425 --> 00:17:54,805
Exactly. It always happened to a
friend of a friend of someone else.

222
00:17:54,888 --> 00:17:56,681
- So?
- So...

223
00:17:56,765 --> 00:18:01,144
...I guess there's this urban myth
goin' around here at the moment.

224
00:18:01,228 --> 00:18:02,938
It's about a beach.

225
00:18:04,648 --> 00:18:06,733
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh.

226
00:18:06,817 --> 00:18:10,237
And this beach is...
perfect, man.

227
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,405
It's on an island, right?

228
00:18:12,906 --> 00:18:15,158
Hidden from the sea.

229
00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:17,994
Now, imagine. You got...

230
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,704
...pure white sand.

231
00:18:19,788 --> 00:18:21,873
Crystal-clear water.

232
00:18:21,957 --> 00:18:25,043
- Palm trees.
- Yeah, with coconuts and shit!

233
00:18:25,127 --> 00:18:27,504
Yo, tell him the best part, dawg.

234
00:18:27,587 --> 00:18:28,630
Plus...

235
00:18:28,713 --> 00:18:30,799
...enough dope, Richard...

236
00:18:30,882 --> 00:18:33,635
...to smoke all day,
every day...

237
00:18:33,718 --> 00:18:37,013
- ...for the rest of your goddamn life!
- Yeah! Mad weed!

238
00:18:39,057 --> 00:18:44,688
Only a few people know exactly where
it is, and they keep it absolutely secret.

239
00:18:44,771 --> 00:18:47,816
No one's actually ever
met any of these people.

240
00:18:47,899 --> 00:18:50,402
Exactly. It's a
Kentucky fried mouse!

241
00:18:50,485 --> 00:18:51,528
Hm!

242
00:18:51,611 --> 00:18:54,406
Although, if I had a key
to a place like that...

243
00:18:54,489 --> 00:19:00,036
...I'd keep it to myself cos... you don't
want every fuckin' asshole in Thailand...

244
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,955
...turnin' up! Boo-boo!

245
00:19:01,997 --> 00:19:04,249
Yeah, yeah.

246
00:19:04,332 --> 00:19:06,918
So whaddaya think
about that story, Richard?

247
00:19:10,255 --> 00:19:12,132
It's good.

248
00:19:12,173 --> 00:19:14,259
It's a good story.

249
00:19:14,342 --> 00:19:17,012
Hey, you!
I got your key!

250
00:19:19,723 --> 00:19:22,350
Now, I know it wasn't
a part of the plan...

251
00:19:22,434 --> 00:19:25,562
...but I made a decision
to leave a copy of the map.

252
00:19:26,396 --> 00:19:29,774
I'm not gonna say it was
the best decision I ever made.

253
00:19:30,775 --> 00:19:35,322
I told myself that spreading news
is a part of a traveler's nature.

254
00:19:36,406 --> 00:19:38,867
But if I was being completely honest...

255
00:19:39,951 --> 00:19:42,120
...I was just like everybody else:

256
00:19:42,954 --> 00:19:45,373
...shit-scared of the great unknown.

257
00:19:46,124 --> 00:19:49,252
Desperate to take a little
piece of home with me.

258
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:05,060
- Richard?
- Are you ready?

259
00:20:05,101 --> 00:20:07,187
Yeah, yeah. I'm coming.

260
00:20:09,356 --> 00:20:11,441
Let's go.

261
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:56,236
Feel dead

262
00:20:56,528 --> 00:20:58,363
Feel dead

263
00:20:58,905 --> 00:21:00,615
Feel dead

264
00:21:01,032 --> 00:21:03,284
Feel dead

265
00:21:03,368 --> 00:21:06,496
Happy

266
00:21:10,959 --> 00:21:12,418
Francoise?

267
00:21:12,502 --> 00:21:15,130
Chut! Etienne will be
angry if I wake him.

268
00:21:15,213 --> 00:21:18,591
He thinks I waste time,
taking photographs of the sky.

269
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,595
Oh...

270
00:21:28,351 --> 00:21:31,479
- I think so, too.
- Yeah?

271
00:21:31,604 --> 00:21:33,690
Have a look.

272
00:21:35,984 --> 00:21:38,945
One night, I will get the
perfect photograph.

273
00:21:49,455 --> 00:21:50,790
Hi!

274
00:21:50,874 --> 00:21:53,001
Whoa!

275
00:22:06,222 --> 00:22:08,308
You realise that...

276
00:22:08,349 --> 00:22:10,435
...in the eternity of space...

277
00:22:12,562 --> 00:22:15,815
...there's probably a
planet out there, right...

278
00:22:16,316 --> 00:22:18,443
...just like this one...

279
00:22:18,484 --> 00:22:20,236
...where another you...

280
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,031
...is photographing back down towards us.

281
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:28,536
I mean, essentially, you are photographing
yourself in a parallel universe.

282
00:22:28,661 --> 00:22:30,705
Incredible.

283
00:22:31,873 --> 00:22:33,958
Yeah...

284
00:22:34,042 --> 00:22:36,628
There are infinite worlds
out there, ya know?

285
00:22:36,711 --> 00:22:39,130
Where anything you want to happen...

286
00:22:39,213 --> 00:22:40,924
...does happen.

287
00:22:41,007 --> 00:22:43,092
Richard, do you know something?

288
00:22:43,176 --> 00:22:44,177
Hm?

289
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:47,180
This is just the kind of
pretentious bullshit...

290
00:22:47,263 --> 00:22:51,184
...Americans always say to French girls...
so they can sleep with them.

291
00:22:54,228 --> 00:22:56,314
God! Sorry.

292
00:22:56,397 --> 00:22:58,566
I thought I was doin' pretty good.

293
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:01,152
It's just the sky,
Richard. Let's try.

294
00:23:01,611 --> 00:23:03,696
Yeah.

295
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,865
Idiot.

296
00:23:09,869 --> 00:23:12,580
Un, deux, trois...

297
00:23:12,664 --> 00:23:13,623
...quatre.

298
00:23:13,706 --> 00:23:17,043
When you develop
an infatuation for someone...

299
00:23:17,126 --> 00:23:21,673
...you always find a reason to believe
that this is exactly the person for you.

300
00:23:21,756 --> 00:23:24,008
It doesn't need to be a good reason.

301
00:23:24,092 --> 00:23:27,345
Taking photographs of the night sky,
for example.

302
00:23:27,428 --> 00:23:29,514
Now, in the long run...

303
00:23:29,597 --> 00:23:34,477
...that's just the kind of dumb, irritating
habit that would cause you to split up.

304
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,854
But in the haze of infatuation...

305
00:23:37,563 --> 00:23:41,442
...it's just what you've been
searching for all these years.

306
00:23:47,782 --> 00:23:50,493
- One kilometer.
- Two.

307
00:23:50,576 --> 00:23:54,497
- Richard?
- I don't know. I'm American.

308
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:57,792
- So?
- We think in miles, not kilometers.

309
00:23:57,875 --> 00:24:00,378
OK. So how many miles
do you think it is?

310
00:24:01,462 --> 00:24:05,133
I don't know.
But it looks like a long way away.

311
00:24:05,216 --> 00:24:07,885
If it's too far,
we're gonna drown.

312
00:24:12,515 --> 00:24:15,017
But if we don't try,
we'll never know, right?

313
00:24:16,102 --> 00:24:17,854
Right.

314
00:24:21,899 --> 00:24:24,152
So let's go!

315
00:24:31,826 --> 00:24:33,494
Whoo!

316
00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:01,731
- Are you guys all right?
- Yeah, we're OK.

317
00:25:01,814 --> 00:25:03,900
I think we're about halfway.

318
00:25:07,862 --> 00:25:10,615
Oh, fuck! Richard!

319
00:25:11,324 --> 00:25:13,409
- Fuck!
- What?

320
00:25:13,492 --> 00:25:15,244
I saw a fin!

321
00:25:15,328 --> 00:25:18,331
- Tsk! What? Are you joking?
- No, no, no!

322
00:25:18,414 --> 00:25:20,041
A fin!

323
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:22,543
OK, a shark fin?

324
00:25:22,627 --> 00:25:26,589
I don't know. Just a fin.
Over there, about 100 metres.

325
00:25:28,925 --> 00:25:32,011
- Well, was it big?
- Yes.

326
00:25:34,013 --> 00:25:36,307
What the fuck do you expect
me to do about it?!

327
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:38,976
Nothing! I just thought
you should know.

328
00:25:39,101 --> 00:25:41,312
To be honest, I'd rather
you hadn't told me!

329
00:25:41,395 --> 00:25:42,731
OK, I'm sorry.

330
00:25:42,732 --> 00:25:45,266
Well, it's a bit fuckin'
late now, isn't it?!

331
00:25:56,577 --> 00:25:59,956
Francoise! Francoise! She's gone!

332
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:01,666
Oh, my God!

333
00:26:01,749 --> 00:26:06,671
- Oh, my God! OK, what happened?
- She just went under the water!

334
00:26:06,754 --> 00:26:08,839
She was pulled under!

335
00:26:10,675 --> 00:26:12,134
Francoise!

336
00:26:12,218 --> 00:26:14,970
Francoise! I don't see her!

337
00:26:15,763 --> 00:26:17,682
Oh, fuck! It's her bag!

338
00:26:17,765 --> 00:26:21,435
OK. Was there a shark?
Did you see a shark, Etienne?

339
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:23,521
I don't know!

340
00:26:23,604 --> 00:26:25,356
I don't know!

341
00:26:25,439 --> 00:26:27,358
Fuck!

342
00:26:27,942 --> 00:26:29,068
Don't fuck me!

343
00:26:36,242 --> 00:26:38,452
Fuck you!

344
00:26:40,705 --> 00:26:42,707
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

345
00:26:44,959 --> 00:26:47,628
Oh, you Europeans, you're so funny

346
00:26:47,712 --> 00:26:50,715
You have such a
playful sense of humor

347
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:53,968
No wonder your comedy
has conquered the world

348
00:26:54,051 --> 00:26:56,762
- What about Moliere?
- Who?

349
00:26:57,304 --> 00:26:58,973
Oh, fuck off!

350
00:27:55,237 --> 00:27:56,947
- Agh!
- Come on.

351
00:28:12,254 --> 00:28:14,340
Wow!

352
00:28:23,766 --> 00:28:26,977
Now, this is what
I call a lot of dope!

353
00:28:32,191 --> 00:28:34,235
Oh, putain!

354
00:28:40,491 --> 00:28:42,576
T'as dupapiera rouler?

355
00:28:51,585 --> 00:28:54,088
Hey! Tch, tch, tch!

356
00:30:00,446 --> 00:30:02,531
OK... OK...

357
00:30:03,282 --> 00:30:06,827
We're gonna go this way.
OK? Shut up. Shut up.

358
00:31:34,748 --> 00:31:36,833
Argh! Agh!

359
00:31:50,055 --> 00:31:52,140
Sure, we should've turned back.

360
00:31:52,933 --> 00:31:55,018
But I wasn't going to.

361
00:31:55,102 --> 00:31:57,187
Not now.

362
00:31:57,271 --> 00:31:59,856
I just kept telling them we'd get there.

363
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,483
"Trust me...

364
00:32:01,566 --> 00:32:03,986
...it's paradise."

365
00:32:04,027 --> 00:32:07,197
if we take this down,
it should lead us all the way.

366
00:32:08,782 --> 00:32:10,867
Come on!

367
00:32:43,775 --> 00:32:45,861
Oh, God!

368
00:32:54,453 --> 00:32:57,372
Putain de merde!

369
00:33:03,128 --> 00:33:05,213
Well?

370
00:33:05,297 --> 00:33:08,925
- Well what?
- How do we get down?

371
00:33:09,009 --> 00:33:12,512
How am I supposed to know?
Do I have to decide everything?

372
00:33:12,596 --> 00:33:15,724
- We'll jump.
- Fuck! You wanted to be in command!

373
00:33:15,807 --> 00:33:19,770
I only took command because
you lost your nerve, French boy!

374
00:33:19,853 --> 00:33:22,272
Yeah. And look where
you've taken us!

375
00:33:23,565 --> 00:33:25,650
- We'll jump.
- If you're not happy...

376
00:33:25,734 --> 00:33:28,153
...you can just take over.
All right, sir?!

377
00:33:28,236 --> 00:33:30,238
All right, I will.

378
00:33:30,322 --> 00:33:33,742
- There. We climb down there.
- We can jump.

379
00:33:33,825 --> 00:33:36,912
Francoise! Look...
We're not gonna jump!

380
00:33:36,995 --> 00:33:40,123
All right? So just can it!
And as for climbing down there...

381
00:33:40,207 --> 00:33:41,500
...that is just...

382
00:33:41,583 --> 00:33:44,377
...an asshole suggestion!

383
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:50,926
- Calling me an asshole?
- Yeah. And that's just the start of it.

384
00:33:50,967 --> 00:33:53,762
- All right, fuckface, let's do it!
- Motherfucker!

385
00:33:54,471 --> 00:33:55,722
Francoise!

386
00:33:59,601 --> 00:34:02,437
- Shit!
- Francoise!

387
00:34:07,817 --> 00:34:10,237
Come on, guys! It's OK!

388
00:34:10,278 --> 00:34:13,573
It's not dangerous! Come on!

389
00:34:13,657 --> 00:34:16,117
Drop the bags down! Come on!

390
00:34:16,201 --> 00:34:19,120
All right. So we'll jump.

391
00:34:19,204 --> 00:34:21,748
Oh, fuck!

392
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:34,678
Whoa!

393
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,763
Whoo-hoo!

394
00:34:36,805 --> 00:34:39,057
Did you see that? Shit!

395
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:41,226
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

396
00:34:41,309 --> 00:34:42,602
Yes!

397
00:34:42,686 --> 00:34:44,771
Whoo-hoo!

398
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:58,159
Oh, my God!

399
00:34:59,911 --> 00:35:02,831
Congratulations!

400
00:35:02,914 --> 00:35:06,668
Took me the best part of an hour
to work up the balls to do that.

401
00:35:08,753 --> 00:35:13,591
Mind you, I was on my own, so you have to
make allowances. Ya know what I mean?

402
00:35:15,093 --> 00:35:17,804
I think maybe you'd
better meet up with Sal.

403
00:35:17,887 --> 00:35:20,807
Jesus Christ! We're fuckin' here!

404
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:23,101
Do ya realise that?

405
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:28,815
Don't you go anywhere!

406
00:35:35,447 --> 00:35:37,115
All right.

407
00:35:37,198 --> 00:35:39,284
You're doin' well.

408
00:35:40,201 --> 00:35:43,705
- Ciao! Sonja! A que si?
- Hi.

409
00:35:49,461 --> 00:35:51,546
Noisy kitchen!

410
00:35:51,629 --> 00:35:53,506
How are ya doin'?

411
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:56,509
- What's for dinner?
- One guess. Fish.

412
00:35:56,593 --> 00:35:58,636
I don't know what we expected.

413
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,348
People living in a cave,
maybe even a few guys in tents.

414
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,683
Gregorio!

415
00:36:03,767 --> 00:36:05,769
But nothing like this.

416
00:36:05,852 --> 00:36:07,896
- How are you, Keaty?
- Don't smoke 'em!

417
00:36:07,979 --> 00:36:10,648
It was like we arrived
into a lost world.

418
00:36:10,732 --> 00:36:14,935
A full-scale community of travelers;
not just passing through,

419
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,058
but actually living here.

420
00:36:20,492 --> 00:36:22,619
I suddenly became aware...

421
00:36:23,369 --> 00:36:25,455
...that we weren't even invited.

422
00:36:31,878 --> 00:36:34,547
- The guy who drew it?
- Daffy.

423
00:36:35,215 --> 00:36:37,717
Yeah... Yeah. He's dead.

424
00:36:37,801 --> 00:36:40,011
What? No way!

425
00:36:40,094 --> 00:36:43,973
Yeah. He cut his wrists open in a
hotel room on the Khao San Road.

426
00:36:44,057 --> 00:36:47,143
- You have seen this?!
- Well, I came afterwards.

427
00:36:49,646 --> 00:36:52,565
Well, that's sad news.

428
00:36:53,525 --> 00:36:56,569
He was... one of the founders
of our community.

429
00:36:56,653 --> 00:36:58,321
Oh.

430
00:36:58,363 --> 00:37:00,448
But he became depressed.

431
00:37:00,532 --> 00:37:03,034
Crazy.

432
00:37:04,285 --> 00:37:09,290
The police didn't know what to do with
the body, so I guess they'll incinerate him.

433
00:37:13,962 --> 00:37:17,090
Do you think he gave a
map to anybody else?

434
00:37:17,173 --> 00:37:19,425
I-I... No, I don't think so.

435
00:37:20,343 --> 00:37:23,054
And you. Have you
shown this map to anybody?

436
00:37:23,137 --> 00:37:24,180
No.

437
00:37:24,889 --> 00:37:25,932
No.

438
00:37:26,891 --> 00:37:28,434
No.

439
00:37:30,395 --> 00:37:31,646
Good.

440
00:37:33,982 --> 00:37:36,985
We value our secrecy.

441
00:37:41,114 --> 00:37:43,533
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

442
00:38:01,884 --> 00:38:03,970
You hear that? You hear that?

443
00:38:07,181 --> 00:38:09,267
Look at this guy.

444
00:38:44,969 --> 00:38:47,180
Oh, c'est magnifique.

445
00:39:05,573 --> 00:39:07,867
Oh, it's so fucking beautiful, man!

446
00:39:40,483 --> 00:39:43,361
- Neighbours!
- Hey! I've got your oils, man.

447
00:39:45,696 --> 00:39:47,782
I want to give you something.

448
00:39:47,865 --> 00:39:51,452
Listen up, everybody.

449
00:39:51,536 --> 00:39:53,454
OK.

450
00:39:53,496 --> 00:39:57,083
Tomorrow, I will travel
for many miles on a bicycle.

451
00:39:58,084 --> 00:39:59,126
Um...

452
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:00,253
Vicki.

453
00:40:00,336 --> 00:40:02,255
Uh... Uh...

454
00:40:02,338 --> 00:40:04,674
Uh... Sutra cuputovati...

455
00:40:04,715 --> 00:40:06,676
...mnogo milja biciklom.

456
00:40:06,759 --> 00:40:09,220
Great! Very good. Helene?

457
00:40:09,303 --> 00:40:11,389
Very good!

458
00:40:11,472 --> 00:40:16,227
Sutra cuputovati...
mnogo milja biciklom.

459
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:17,645
Very good.

460
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:20,898
Right. It's far too easy, though.

461
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:24,110
- Oh, please!
- Yes! OK.

462
00:40:24,652 --> 00:40:28,739
Sutra cuputovatimnogo milja
biciklom. Da posetim svoju tatu...

463
00:40:28,823 --> 00:40:34,203
...koji cuva koze na planini.
There's more, ya know!

464
00:40:34,245 --> 00:40:37,415
- You always know everything!
- Richard!

465
00:40:40,751 --> 00:40:42,336
Sutra...

466
00:40:42,378 --> 00:40:43,921
...cu...

467
00:40:44,005 --> 00:40:45,464
...putovati...

468
00:40:45,548 --> 00:40:47,633
...mnogo milja biciklom.

469
00:40:47,717 --> 00:40:49,135
Yes! Richard!

470
00:40:49,218 --> 00:40:51,137
Represented, man!

471
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:54,765
Sutra cuputovati
mnogo milja biciklom.

472
00:40:55,766 --> 00:40:57,310
This became our world.

473
00:40:58,269 --> 00:41:00,646
And these people, our family.

474
00:41:02,148 --> 00:41:05,735
Back home was just one more
place we didn't think about.

475
00:41:06,277 --> 00:41:08,070
I settled in.

476
00:41:08,154 --> 00:41:10,031
I found my vocation:

477
00:41:10,114 --> 00:41:12,199
...the pursuit...

478
00:41:12,283 --> 00:41:13,909
...of pleasure.

479
00:41:28,174 --> 00:41:30,217
Sal was the leader.

480
00:41:30,301 --> 00:41:34,430
But it wasn't a big deal. I mean,
there wasn't any ideology or shit like that.

481
00:41:34,513 --> 00:41:38,601
It was just a beach resort...
for people who don't like beach resorts.

482
00:41:38,684 --> 00:41:40,311
...some of us build.

483
00:41:40,394 --> 00:41:43,439
Even paradise takes a little shaping.

484
00:41:47,651 --> 00:41:49,779
For years, they kept this place a secret.

485
00:41:49,862 --> 00:41:54,241
They didn't need to tell anyone.
They were practically self-sufficient.

486
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:58,300
The only thing they had to do
was sail back once in a while

487
00:41:58,301 --> 00:42:01,001
to trade a little marijuana
and buy some rice.

488
00:42:02,917 --> 00:42:06,712
We grow our own, so no stealing
from the farmers on the other side.

489
00:42:06,837 --> 00:42:09,215
And do they know that
you're living here?

490
00:42:09,298 --> 00:42:13,761
Oh, yeah. But they keep to their side
and we don't trespass on their turf.

491
00:42:13,886 --> 00:42:18,808
A couple of years ago, they said that we
could stay, but nobody else should come.

492
00:42:18,891 --> 00:42:22,061
- Which kind of suits us as well.
- So you was lucky, ya know.

493
00:42:22,144 --> 00:42:23,562
Very lucky.

494
00:42:23,646 --> 00:42:26,398
There was Keaty, who only
cared about two things.

495
00:42:26,482 --> 00:42:28,567
Thank you, Lord...

496
00:42:28,651 --> 00:42:31,529
...for the twin pillars of civilization:

497
00:42:32,488 --> 00:42:33,989
...Christianity...

498
00:42:34,073 --> 00:42:36,826
...and cricket.

499
00:42:40,121 --> 00:42:41,622
There were the Swedes:

500
00:42:41,705 --> 00:42:43,791
...Christo, Sten and Karl.

501
00:42:43,874 --> 00:42:45,960
We like fishing.

502
00:42:47,795 --> 00:42:50,548
- And in the winter, we like skiing.
- Yeah!

503
00:42:52,133 --> 00:42:54,802
Of course, in Thailand,
there is no skiing.

504
00:42:54,885 --> 00:42:57,388
We wait, OK?

505
00:42:57,471 --> 00:42:59,807
We wait for the fish to come.

506
00:43:04,311 --> 00:43:05,729
Get it?

507
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:08,649
- Shit! No way!
- Whoo!

508
00:43:08,732 --> 00:43:11,986
And I said to thee "I shall provide!"

509
00:43:12,027 --> 00:43:13,737
Yeah!

510
00:43:17,116 --> 00:43:18,909
- Stop it.
- What?

511
00:43:23,873 --> 00:43:26,667
Our resident chef was
known as Unhygenix.

512
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:28,335
Let's cook!

513
00:43:28,419 --> 00:43:30,671
On account of his obsession with soap.

514
00:43:30,754 --> 00:43:32,840
Fish, fish, fish!

515
00:43:37,636 --> 00:43:39,722
Still I smell of fish!

516
00:43:39,805 --> 00:43:44,685
There was a range of sporting
and leisure activities to suit all tastes.

517
00:43:44,768 --> 00:43:46,854
Etienne is good at soccer.

518
00:43:46,937 --> 00:43:49,899
Ya know, I could do
that if I wanted to.

519
00:43:49,982 --> 00:43:52,860
- I just don't want to.
- What are you talking about?

520
00:43:53,944 --> 00:43:57,364
- Making conversation.
- Do you have a girlfriend?

521
00:43:58,032 --> 00:44:00,117
- Here?
- Anywhere.

522
00:44:01,535 --> 00:44:03,996
No. Why?

523
00:44:04,788 --> 00:44:06,999
Just making conversation.

524
00:44:08,334 --> 00:44:10,419
Whoo!

525
00:44:13,569 --> 00:44:16,596
Right arm over wicket.
Three balls remaining.

526
00:44:16,758 --> 00:44:18,739
Is there anyone who
still doesn't understand?

527
00:44:27,436 --> 00:44:32,608
The only person I didn't like was Sal's
boyfriend, Bugs; our on-island carpenter.

528
00:44:32,691 --> 00:44:34,777
Hey, Richard!
Can you do this?

529
00:44:35,736 --> 00:44:37,863
Can you make anything?

530
00:44:39,698 --> 00:44:42,201
A man should have a
talent in his hands.

531
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:45,621
Here we go, people!

532
00:44:45,704 --> 00:44:47,456
Surprise!

533
00:44:47,539 --> 00:44:50,292
So every community
has its rituals.

534
00:44:50,376 --> 00:44:54,797
The last one to arrive
tattoos the next.

535
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,924
It fuckin' hurts, OK?

536
00:44:57,007 --> 00:44:59,593
What did he say?

537
00:45:02,346 --> 00:45:03,430
Agh!

538
00:45:05,766 --> 00:45:08,143
Andy, bring yours closer.

539
00:45:08,227 --> 00:45:10,312
Come on, Richard!

540
00:45:15,526 --> 00:45:17,736
Ohhhh, God!

541
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:21,907
Ohh, God!

542
00:45:22,449 --> 00:45:24,535
Ohh, Jesus!

543
00:45:25,244 --> 00:45:28,414
That fuckin' hurt!

544
00:45:31,959 --> 00:45:34,920
All in all,
this really was paradise.

545
00:45:35,003 --> 00:45:37,089
Except for one thing.

546
00:45:38,132 --> 00:45:40,217
Desire is desire...

547
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:42,261
...wherever you go.

548
00:45:42,344 --> 00:45:44,429
The sun will not bleach it...

549
00:45:44,513 --> 00:45:47,015
...nor the tide wash it away.

550
00:45:48,642 --> 00:45:50,769
Francoise.

551
00:46:25,721 --> 00:46:27,764
She's just teasin' ya.

552
00:46:27,848 --> 00:46:30,350
What are you talking about?

553
00:46:30,475 --> 00:46:32,477
You don't speak French.

554
00:46:32,603 --> 00:46:34,688
He speaks French.

555
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:37,149
In fact, even better than that, four:

556
00:46:37,232 --> 00:46:39,318
...he is French.

557
00:46:39,943 --> 00:46:44,531
He's much better at football,
sorry, soccer, than you.

558
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,910
You're a bit strange, Rich.

559
00:46:47,993 --> 00:46:51,914
Some girls like that in a man, but not
the sort of girls you wanna be with.

560
00:46:51,997 --> 00:46:55,542
- Is that right?
- Come on, your last girlfriend chucked ya.

561
00:46:55,626 --> 00:46:58,879
- It was not my fault!
- Look at your thumbs, man!

562
00:46:59,004 --> 00:47:01,757
- They're well-defined.
- What does that mean?

563
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,926
You play a lot of video games!

564
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,721
That is a powerful index of incompatibility.

565
00:47:08,305 --> 00:47:11,683
Why do I get the feeling you're
trying to tell me something?

566
00:47:11,767 --> 00:47:15,312
You haven't a hope, not a bleedin'
chicken's chance in Thailand.

567
00:47:15,395 --> 00:47:17,773
- Know what I mean?
- Thank you.

568
00:47:18,607 --> 00:47:21,443
So, enjoy the beach
and cut the bullshit.

569
00:47:21,526 --> 00:47:24,738
- Thank you very much.
- It's my pleasure!

570
00:47:25,906 --> 00:47:27,991
No, you cannot... No!

571
00:47:28,075 --> 00:47:30,577
No! No, leave me!

572
00:47:30,661 --> 00:47:32,663
- Leave me!
- Hey! That's my bed!

573
00:47:32,704 --> 00:47:35,749
- I can deal with it!
- I don't want you to deal with it!

574
00:47:35,791 --> 00:47:37,793
It won't take a minute.

575
00:47:37,834 --> 00:47:40,796
Really, no! No,
I must go to mainland!

576
00:47:41,505 --> 00:47:44,591
I'm sick. I've got to. Sal!

577
00:47:44,675 --> 00:47:48,345
What's this? You want to go
to the mainland to see a dentist?

578
00:47:48,428 --> 00:47:51,223
- Yes.
- It's out of the question.

579
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:55,435
Come on!

580
00:47:55,519 --> 00:47:57,604
It'll be fun.

581
00:47:57,688 --> 00:47:59,231
Be brave.

582
00:47:59,314 --> 00:48:01,400
How's it going, Richard?

583
00:48:02,442 --> 00:48:04,236
Fine. Fine.

584
00:48:04,277 --> 00:48:06,738
- Are you OK with this?
- Yeah.

585
00:48:07,989 --> 00:48:10,367
I mean, we have a
secret here, right?

586
00:48:10,409 --> 00:48:14,079
Sometimes people need to take
a little pain to keep it that way.

587
00:48:15,122 --> 00:48:16,748
Excellent.

588
00:48:16,832 --> 00:48:18,917
Excellent attitude.

589
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,586
No problem.

590
00:48:21,628 --> 00:48:24,548
Oh, shit!

591
00:48:28,218 --> 00:48:31,763
Good work!

592
00:48:31,847 --> 00:48:34,766
Kill the pain, boy.

593
00:48:39,938 --> 00:48:42,274
Take a drink.

594
00:48:54,536 --> 00:48:56,621
Richard.

595
00:48:56,705 --> 00:48:58,123
Yeah?

596
00:48:58,206 --> 00:49:00,542
Would you like to come
to the beach with me?

597
00:49:06,464 --> 00:49:08,133
Sure. Yeah.

598
00:49:19,477 --> 00:49:21,605
Are you happy, Richard?

599
00:49:22,147 --> 00:49:24,065
Happy?

600
00:49:24,149 --> 00:49:25,275
Yeah.

601
00:49:25,358 --> 00:49:27,444
Yeah... Yeah, I-I guess.

602
00:49:27,527 --> 00:49:30,197
I mean, the beach, ya know,
it's just perfect.

603
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:32,365
Do you think that I ignore you?

604
00:49:35,911 --> 00:49:37,329
No.

605
00:49:37,412 --> 00:49:39,289
But I do.

606
00:49:39,372 --> 00:49:41,195
It's because I'm with Etienne.

607
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:43,883
It's difficult for me to
spend time with you.

608
00:49:51,301 --> 00:49:55,889
I don't suppose that there's any...
you know, special reason that you should.

609
00:49:57,807 --> 00:50:00,810
- Spend time with me, that is.
- Of course there is.

610
00:50:00,894 --> 00:50:02,479
I like you.

611
00:50:02,562 --> 00:50:04,022
A lot.

612
00:50:04,105 --> 00:50:06,942
Have you... Have you
told this to Etienne? Or...

613
00:50:07,025 --> 00:50:08,068
No.

614
00:50:08,151 --> 00:50:10,487
It's our secret.

615
00:50:11,529 --> 00:50:12,697
OK.

616
00:50:13,698 --> 00:50:16,868
Look! There! The plankton. Shrimps.

617
00:50:16,952 --> 00:50:19,079
When they're disturbed, they glow.

618
00:50:19,162 --> 00:50:21,247
Come on!

619
00:50:21,915 --> 00:50:26,294

That night, we promised ourselves,
and we honestly believed...

629
00:51:34,571 --> 00:51:36,656
...that no one would ever know.

630
00:51:38,867 --> 00:51:41,661
- I wanna talk.
- About what?

631
00:51:42,328 --> 00:51:44,414
About you and Francoise.

632
00:51:44,497 --> 00:51:47,792
Whaddaya mean...
me and Francoise?

633
00:51:50,628 --> 00:51:52,714
I mean, Richard...

634
00:51:53,923 --> 00:51:56,342
- ..that I want her to be happy.
- Yeah.

635
00:51:56,426 --> 00:51:58,511
I mean, of course.

636
00:51:58,553 --> 00:52:00,847
- We all do, right?
- Shut up!

637
00:52:01,973 --> 00:52:04,142
Please shut the fuck up.

638
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:11,316
And if happy is with you...

639
00:52:11,399 --> 00:52:14,068
...then I will not stand in her way.

640
00:52:16,946 --> 00:52:19,032
Etienne, man, I...

641
00:52:19,115 --> 00:52:23,703
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Fuck you, Richard! I know!

642
00:52:23,828 --> 00:52:25,788
OK? I know!

643
00:52:25,914 --> 00:52:27,957
Everybody knows!

644
00:52:39,177 --> 00:52:41,846
The problem is seeing the fish.

645
00:52:42,555 --> 00:52:45,016
With the heavy rain
and the bad light...

646
00:52:45,099 --> 00:52:47,810
...it's very difficult to catch them.

647
00:52:47,894 --> 00:52:50,438
It can last for days.

648
00:52:51,105 --> 00:52:53,149
Sometimes...

649
00:52:53,233 --> 00:52:55,318
...we get really hungry.

650
00:53:03,368 --> 00:53:05,328
Gimme that.

651
00:53:07,789 --> 00:53:09,582
Richard!

652
00:53:34,315 --> 00:53:36,401
Richard! Richard!

653
00:53:37,068 --> 00:53:39,320
Come out!

654
00:53:40,571 --> 00:53:42,657
I can't hear you!

655
00:53:47,745 --> 00:53:50,039
And you can't hear me.

656
00:53:51,624 --> 00:53:54,168
- Shark!
- Come!

657
00:54:16,232 --> 00:54:17,191
Shark!

658
00:54:23,322 --> 00:54:25,783
Ohh!

659
00:54:30,747 --> 00:54:33,458
All right, all right.

660
00:54:33,541 --> 00:54:35,626
All right, all right, all right!

661
00:54:37,128 --> 00:54:38,379
Shh!

662
00:54:39,881 --> 00:54:44,051
Now before I start, there's just a couple
of things you have to remember.

663
00:54:45,845 --> 00:54:48,181
You have to remain calm.

664
00:54:48,264 --> 00:54:50,349
Right?

665
00:54:51,517 --> 00:54:54,729
You have to show no fear.

666
00:54:54,812 --> 00:54:57,440
- Teach it, teach it.
- Because the sharks...

667
00:54:57,565 --> 00:55:00,485
You see, the sharks,
they can sense that fear.

668
00:55:01,277 --> 00:55:03,821
Just as easily as
they can sense blood.

669
00:55:05,198 --> 00:55:07,283
And so it went for me.

670
00:55:07,366 --> 00:55:09,452
Just as I knew it would.

671
00:55:09,535 --> 00:55:11,621
Just as nature had ordained.

672
00:55:11,704 --> 00:55:14,248
Its... jaw wide open.

673
00:55:15,291 --> 00:55:21,839
Row upon row of these razor-sharp teeth
glinting underwater like... jagged diamonds.

674
00:55:21,923 --> 00:55:26,219
It's tail fin sweeping back and
forth as it surged in for the kill.

675
00:55:27,470 --> 00:55:28,930
I swear to God...

676
00:55:29,013 --> 00:55:31,557
...my whole life
flashed before my eyes.

677
00:55:33,351 --> 00:55:34,977
Really.

678
00:55:35,061 --> 00:55:37,939
I had nothing left to offer
except for pure reflex.

679
00:55:38,022 --> 00:55:39,607
Pure reflex...

680
00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:43,778
...and mankind's basic drive
for survival that somehow...

681
00:55:43,861 --> 00:55:47,907
...shouts "No! I will not die today!"

682
00:55:47,990 --> 00:55:50,660
- Yes!
- Whoo!

683
00:55:52,495 --> 00:55:55,623
At that instant, I knew
it was either the shark or me.

684
00:55:55,706 --> 00:55:57,917
The shark knew it.

685
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,086
I knew it.

686
00:56:01,545 --> 00:56:03,339
But jeez... God!

687
00:56:03,422 --> 00:56:08,010
It's nothin' personal, right? It's just
the way the world works. It's nature.

688
00:56:10,972 --> 00:56:13,099
But... if I remember correctly...

689
00:56:15,726 --> 00:56:18,229
...in that last glimmer of its eyes...

690
00:56:20,731 --> 00:56:22,942
...there was a moment between us...

691
00:56:26,946 --> 00:56:29,365
...where it said "Hey, Richard, man."

692
00:56:30,574 --> 00:56:32,118
"Enjoy your dinner."

693
00:56:45,965 --> 00:56:49,510
Strange thing, killing a shark,
isn't it, Richard?

694
00:56:52,346 --> 00:56:54,432
It's just a big fish, Bugs.

695
00:56:54,515 --> 00:56:56,517
Just a big fish?

696
00:56:56,600 --> 00:57:01,439
Yeah, maybe! Maybe when it's just a baby
and it hasn't really learned to kill yet.

697
00:57:01,522 --> 00:57:03,607
Then maybe it's just a big fish.

698
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:08,738
But when it's a great white angry mother
with the taste of blood on its tongue...

699
00:57:08,821 --> 00:57:11,032
...now that's a different story.

700
00:57:19,290 --> 00:57:21,459
Oh, God! Jeez...

701
00:57:21,542 --> 00:57:23,627
I'm sorry, Bugs.
Is it just me?

702
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:26,547
Or does this wet weather
make everyone so damn tired?

703
00:57:26,630 --> 00:57:30,885
Maybe we can hear your very different
and, I'm sure, very interesting story...

704
00:57:30,968 --> 00:57:33,888
...some other time, huh?

705
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,893
Very interesting, Keaty!

706
00:57:38,976 --> 00:57:41,896
Verlo interesantno.

707
00:57:46,567 --> 00:57:49,487
Molto interessante!

708
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:53,032
- Good night, young lovers.
- Shut up!

709
00:57:53,115 --> 00:57:56,952
For a while, we were untouchable
in our happiness.

710
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:02,958
All right! Everybody!

711
00:58:03,042 --> 00:58:06,045
Quiet!

712
00:58:06,086 --> 00:58:10,800
We have a situation. It's not a disaster.
But as some of you may have heard...

713
00:58:10,883 --> 00:58:15,137
...a couple of sacks of rice have
become contaminated by a fungus.

714
00:58:15,221 --> 00:58:17,515
- Yeah.
- It's cos we keep it in that shack.

715
00:58:17,598 --> 00:58:20,351
- How many more times must this happen?
- Rice run!

716
00:58:20,392 --> 00:58:22,311
Which means that...

717
00:58:22,394 --> 00:58:25,606
...someone will have to come
to Ko Pha-Ngan to buy more rice.

718
00:58:29,401 --> 00:58:31,820
So don't all volunteer at once

719
00:58:39,578 --> 00:58:41,080
Richard.

720
00:58:41,163 --> 00:58:42,289
Yeah?

721
00:58:43,123 --> 00:58:45,876
Are you gonna come
to Ko Pha-Ngan with me?

722
00:58:46,919 --> 00:58:50,089
- I don't know. I mean...
- I'll go with you.

723
00:58:50,172 --> 00:58:52,550
Don't worry, Bugs.
Richard's gonna come.

724
00:58:52,633 --> 00:58:54,426
Am I?

725
00:58:54,510 --> 00:58:57,972
- Who thinks Richard should come?
- Absolutely.

726
00:58:58,806 --> 00:59:01,767
All right. Then I'll go
to Ko Pha-Ngan with you.

727
00:59:05,437 --> 00:59:07,565
So, Richard...

728
00:59:07,648 --> 00:59:11,193
...I want toothpaste and...
and a toothbrush, yeah?

729
00:59:11,277 --> 00:59:12,278
Right.

730
00:59:12,361 --> 00:59:15,572
Uh... a new pair of swim
trunks and a new hat.

731
00:59:16,865 --> 00:59:18,826
Richard...

732
00:59:18,909 --> 00:59:23,038
100 aspirin, 100 paracetamol,
six packs of tampons.

733
00:59:23,122 --> 00:59:27,418
...and four AA batteries... and 20 condoms.
Make it 40 condoms.

734
00:59:27,501 --> 00:59:29,545
And a bottle of vodka.

735
00:59:29,586 --> 00:59:32,089
- Six bars of chocolate.
- Uh... Fuck!

736
00:59:32,172 --> 00:59:34,675
Four boxes of tampons.
Assorted sizes.

737
00:59:34,717 --> 00:59:37,469
Smell it. It's a part of me.

738
00:59:37,594 --> 00:59:39,888
I am becoming a fish, Richard.

739
00:59:39,972 --> 00:59:43,309
Ordinary soap for ordinary
people is a waste of time.

740
00:59:43,392 --> 00:59:46,770
I need something toxic,
something industrial. OK?

741
00:59:46,854 --> 00:59:47,813
OK.

742
00:59:47,896 --> 00:59:50,024
A tin of beef curry. Yummy.

743
00:59:50,107 --> 00:59:53,777
- Yummy.
- As many AAA batteries as you can find.

744
00:59:53,902 --> 00:59:55,988
And a copy of...

745
00:59:56,071 --> 00:59:58,198
...The Daily Telegraph.

746
00:59:58,282 --> 01:00:00,868
It's just for the cricket, ya know.

747
01:00:00,951 --> 01:00:02,036
Oh.

748
01:00:02,119 --> 01:00:04,836
Please, fill this bag
with a soft bog roll.

749
01:00:05,079 --> 01:00:06,473
Soft bog roll?

750
01:00:06,523 --> 01:00:09,877
Jasmine tea, Tiger balm, lip balm,
tea tree oil, bath oil...

751
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:12,046
A big box of bleach.

752
01:00:12,129 --> 01:00:14,798
...hair conditioner, skin conditioner...

753
01:00:14,882 --> 01:00:17,342
- Anything based on sugar.
- 12 packs of Rizla.

754
01:00:17,426 --> 01:00:19,136
Cumin, saffron, cinnamon.

755
01:00:19,219 --> 01:00:21,847
...antiperspirant and make-up remover.

756
01:00:27,895 --> 01:00:30,939
Whaddaya want?

757
01:00:31,732 --> 01:00:34,401
Oh-hoh! Ow! Oh... OK...

758
01:00:34,485 --> 01:00:38,072
When you get to Ko Pha-Ngan,
keep your hands to yourself...

759
01:00:38,155 --> 01:00:40,532
...and your dick in your pants.

760
01:00:40,616 --> 01:00:42,701
Agh...

761
01:00:50,292 --> 01:00:52,377
Oh! Shit!

762
01:00:52,461 --> 01:00:54,129
Oh, shit!

763
01:00:54,213 --> 01:00:58,175
I'd been looking forward to
air conditioning and cold beer...

764
01:00:58,217 --> 01:01:00,177
...but when we got to Ko Pha-Ngan...

765
01:01:01,386 --> 01:01:03,472
...I just wanted to leave again.

766
01:01:03,555 --> 01:01:08,685
In one moment, I understood more clearly
than ever why we were so special...

767
01:01:08,769 --> 01:01:10,979
...why we kept our secret.

768
01:01:11,063 --> 01:01:12,856
Because if we didn't...

769
01:01:13,982 --> 01:01:16,610
...sooner or later,
they'd turn it into this.

770
01:01:23,575 --> 01:01:25,702
Cancers.

771
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:29,081
Parasites.

772
01:01:32,209 --> 01:01:34,920
Eating up the whole fuckin' world.

773
01:01:45,806 --> 01:01:48,850
A couple of months.
Maybe... maybe a year, even.

774
01:01:50,227 --> 01:01:52,312
Yeah, really.

775
01:01:53,105 --> 01:01:55,190
What?

776
01:01:55,232 --> 01:01:58,569
L-I like it out here, you know.
Things are different.

777
01:01:58,652 --> 01:02:00,737
I said, things are different!

778
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,073
Yeah.

779
01:02:03,156 --> 01:02:06,326
No, I'll call again.
I'll call again. I promise.

780
01:02:06,910 --> 01:02:07,995
OK?

781
01:02:08,078 --> 01:02:10,163
I miss you, too.

782
01:02:10,247 --> 01:02:11,832
All right.

783
01:02:11,915 --> 01:02:13,000
OK.

784
01:02:13,083 --> 01:02:15,168
All right. Bye!

785
01:02:22,718 --> 01:02:24,803
Bye...

786
01:02:24,886 --> 01:02:27,764
How does it feel to be
back in the real world?

787
01:02:27,806 --> 01:02:31,226
- It's not like I remembered it.
- It gets worse every time.

788
01:02:34,146 --> 01:02:36,106
It is Richard! Damn!

789
01:02:36,189 --> 01:02:38,275
God! How are ya doin', man?

790
01:02:38,358 --> 01:02:40,027
Damn!

791
01:02:40,110 --> 01:02:42,154
Aw, Sammy, come on over, man!

792
01:02:42,237 --> 01:02:46,033
- Ricardo! What's up, bro?
- Girls, I want you to meet the man!

793
01:02:46,116 --> 01:02:48,827
- The man!
- Hilda und Eva, das ist Richard.

794
01:02:48,910 --> 01:02:51,246
- Hello.
- The man with the map.

795
01:02:51,330 --> 01:02:54,207
- Der Mensch mit der Wanderkarte?
- Ja!

796
01:02:54,291 --> 01:02:56,960
They're gonna come with us, bro'.

797
01:02:57,044 --> 01:02:59,588
Sorry it's been so long,
but you know...

798
01:02:59,671 --> 01:03:03,008
Uh, listen, guys,
I... I made a mistake.

799
01:03:03,091 --> 01:03:04,926
What are you talking about, man?

800
01:03:05,010 --> 01:03:07,012
No, listen to me.
There's no beach.

801
01:03:07,095 --> 01:03:10,057
- I can't believe we're seeing you, dude!
- No beach?

802
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:12,809
Yeah. No, seriously, the map thing?
It was fake.

803
01:03:12,893 --> 01:03:15,812
- It was a story.
- Right

804
01:03:15,896 --> 01:03:18,899
No! It's... it's a myth.
Really. It doesn't exist.

805
01:03:18,982 --> 01:03:21,568
- C'mon...
- The map was a fake. Understand?

806
01:03:21,693 --> 01:03:24,279
You wouldn't be holding
out on us, would ya?

807
01:03:24,362 --> 01:03:27,908
Let me guess.
It's a fuckin' paradise!

808
01:03:27,949 --> 01:03:30,744
Aw, man! What are you
talkin' about? Yo, Zeph.

809
01:03:30,869 --> 01:03:32,176
I think he's just tryin' to...

810
01:03:32,177 --> 01:03:35,157
I'm tellin' ya to forget it,
all right, asshole?!

811
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:40,837
That's the last time
I buy you a fuckin' beer!

812
01:03:43,882 --> 01:03:46,676
So you told them
where you were going?

813
01:03:47,677 --> 01:03:49,763
Yeah.

814
01:03:49,846 --> 01:03:52,224
And they saw the map?

815
01:03:55,310 --> 01:03:57,395
- Mm-hm.
- Do they have a copy?

816
01:03:57,437 --> 01:03:59,147
No.

817
01:04:08,782 --> 01:04:10,826
OK.

818
01:04:10,909 --> 01:04:12,994
Well, we can relax for a bit.

819
01:04:15,163 --> 01:04:18,875
I doubt they have it in them to
get there anyway. But, Richard...

820
01:04:18,959 --> 01:04:21,253
...I don't think we should tell anybody.

821
01:04:21,336 --> 01:04:24,589
OK? I think we should
keep it between you and I.

822
01:04:25,632 --> 01:04:27,300
Thanks.

823
01:04:27,384 --> 01:04:29,469
Don't mention it.

824
01:04:29,553 --> 01:04:31,388
Phew!

825
01:04:36,309 --> 01:04:38,562
Well, I'm going to go and play...

826
01:04:38,645 --> 01:04:41,189
...a couple of games
of pool with Sumet.

827
01:04:41,231 --> 01:04:42,440
Sumet!

828
01:04:42,524 --> 01:04:44,609
Snook?

829
01:04:44,693 --> 01:04:47,153
So why don't you go...

830
01:04:47,237 --> 01:04:49,823
...and warm the bed?

831
01:05:16,099 --> 01:05:18,518
Come on! Mm!

832
01:05:31,615 --> 01:05:33,700
Sal?

833
01:05:35,535 --> 01:05:37,621
- Sal?
- Mm-hm?

834
01:05:40,874 --> 01:05:42,959
I just have a question.

835
01:05:44,127 --> 01:05:46,254
It was very nice.

836
01:05:46,338 --> 01:05:48,423
No. That's not it.

837
01:05:50,884 --> 01:05:52,969
It's about Bugs.

838
01:05:57,766 --> 01:05:59,476
OK...

839
01:06:00,518 --> 01:06:02,604
It's like this.

840
01:06:02,687 --> 01:06:04,731
Bugs is my boyfriend.

841
01:06:05,607 --> 01:06:07,359
My partner.

842
01:06:07,442 --> 01:06:08,735
OK?

843
01:06:08,777 --> 01:06:11,905
And you... are someone
I just had sex with.

844
01:06:14,115 --> 01:06:17,577
- All right?
- That... that's fine.

845
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:20,747
- That's absolutely fine.
- Good.

846
01:06:20,872 --> 01:06:25,418
Now get some sleep. I may wish to
have sex again before we eat breakfast.

847
01:06:49,025 --> 01:06:51,111
It was a deal.

848
01:06:51,194 --> 01:06:54,239
She wouldn't tell anyone
about the map.

849
01:06:54,322 --> 01:06:58,076
I had paid for her silence
and bought my ticket back.

850
01:06:59,077 --> 01:07:02,330
But I didn't even wanna
think about the real price.

851
01:07:12,715 --> 01:07:15,135
All right, Rich, we're ready!

852
01:07:17,011 --> 01:07:19,389
OK.

853
01:07:23,309 --> 01:07:25,854
- Got it, Keaty?
- Yeah! No probs!

854
01:07:43,413 --> 01:07:46,916
- Richard!
- Problem solved. Here's the bleach.

855
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,878
We got the make-up remover.
I have two of 'em.

856
01:07:49,961 --> 01:07:51,254
Oh...

857
01:07:51,337 --> 01:07:54,299
- Extra! Extra!
- Oh, Richard, man, I love you!

858
01:07:55,008 --> 01:07:57,093
Man, this is gonna last me...

859
01:07:57,176 --> 01:07:59,262
Oh, great! You're lovely.

860
01:07:59,345 --> 01:08:01,514
- Did you get batteries?
- Right here.

861
01:08:01,598 --> 01:08:02,682
Yes!

862
01:08:02,765 --> 01:08:07,645
- I can see my baby! Whoo-hoo!
- Sten, that's all for you. Christo...

863
01:08:07,770 --> 01:08:10,148
Hey, Ricardo!

864
01:08:10,231 --> 01:08:12,317
- Grazie!
- One tin of beef curry?

865
01:08:24,078 --> 01:08:26,831
One... disposable camera.

866
01:08:28,291 --> 01:08:33,087
It's not as good as the one you left behind,
but... what the hell, right?

867
01:08:33,212 --> 01:08:35,423
No, it doesn't matter. I like it.

868
01:08:37,967 --> 01:08:39,677
What's wrong?

869
01:08:39,761 --> 01:08:42,263
- How was it?
- The rice run? Fine.

870
01:08:42,388 --> 01:08:43,931
No problem.

871
01:08:44,015 --> 01:08:46,100
I mean, being with Sal.

872
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:49,979
Fine. I mean...
We got along OK.

873
01:08:53,608 --> 01:08:55,860
Some people say she's
attracted to you.

874
01:08:57,195 --> 01:09:00,323
Shit! I... I really wouldn't
have noticed that.

875
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:04,118
- Nothing happened?
- No! Of course not!

876
01:09:05,953 --> 01:09:07,997
You promise?

877
01:09:08,081 --> 01:09:10,541
I was so happy to be back...

878
01:09:10,625 --> 01:09:13,419
...that I couldn't bear
to spoil the moment.

879
01:09:13,503 --> 01:09:15,588
Yes.

880
01:09:15,672 --> 01:09:17,757
Yes, I promise.

881
01:09:32,855 --> 01:09:34,941
I missed you.

882
01:09:36,734 --> 01:09:39,570
OK, come on, everybody!
Come on, please!

883
01:09:40,530 --> 01:09:42,573
Come on... please.

884
01:09:43,199 --> 01:09:45,284
All together. Close together.

885
01:09:45,368 --> 01:09:47,453
Please!

886
01:09:48,830 --> 01:09:50,915
OK, close together.

887
01:09:50,998 --> 01:09:53,209
OK. Stand back a little bit.

888
01:09:53,292 --> 01:09:55,378
OK...

889
01:09:55,878 --> 01:09:59,006
So, one... two... three!

890
01:10:01,801 --> 01:10:04,595
So I started just where I left off.

891
01:10:04,679 --> 01:10:08,099
It was almost like my trip
to Ko Pha-Ngan never happened.

892
01:10:09,225 --> 01:10:11,310
Almost.

893
01:10:16,232 --> 01:10:19,443
- Agh!
- You'll be all right!

894
01:10:23,990 --> 01:10:26,492
Argh!

895
01:10:28,119 --> 01:10:30,413
Tsk!

896
01:10:38,838 --> 01:10:40,965
Shark!

897
01:10:41,841 --> 01:10:43,676
Shark!

898
01:11:00,985 --> 01:11:03,529
Shaaark!

899
01:11:09,785 --> 01:11:13,456
- He's dead.
- Shut up! He's fuckin' not dead!

900
01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:47,865
My... my...

901
01:11:47,907 --> 01:11:49,992
My leg!

902
01:11:50,785 --> 01:11:52,870
My leg!

903
01:12:02,463 --> 01:12:05,966
We can take you to a hospital,
all right? We can do that.

904
01:12:06,092 --> 01:12:10,179
But when you're there, you mustn't
tell anybody where this happened.

905
01:12:10,262 --> 01:12:12,306
We have to keep our secret.

906
01:12:12,390 --> 01:12:15,393
- Lakaren maste komma hit!
- What's he saying?

907
01:12:15,434 --> 01:12:18,813
He says that we are to
bring help here for him.

908
01:12:18,896 --> 01:12:20,981
He won't go near the water.

909
01:12:21,065 --> 01:12:25,236
I understand that, but we can't
bring anybody here. We can't do that.

910
01:12:25,361 --> 01:12:28,739
- Bring help! You've gotta bring help!
- We can't, Christo!

911
01:12:28,823 --> 01:12:32,243
You have to go. Or you stay
here and take your chances.

912
01:12:35,496 --> 01:12:39,625
- Anyone disagree?
- Karl... varharhantmed Sten?

913
01:12:39,708 --> 01:12:42,002
What is he saying?

914
01:12:42,086 --> 01:12:44,964
He wants to know what
happened to his friend.

915
01:12:51,095 --> 01:12:55,474
We are gathered here today
to say a last respect to Sten.

916
01:12:56,976 --> 01:12:59,061
May God take your soul.

917
01:13:00,062 --> 01:13:03,357
And you will rest forever in peace, mate.

918
01:13:07,027 --> 01:13:08,654
We'll miss ya.

919
01:13:12,283 --> 01:13:14,743
Jag alskar dig,
from Christo and me.

920
01:13:17,997 --> 01:13:20,040
Riposati in pace...

921
01:13:20,124 --> 01:13:22,126

Argh!

936
01:14:48,671 --> 01:14:52,299
After the funeral,
we all tried to get back to normal.

937
01:14:52,383 --> 01:14:55,386
But it just didn't seem right.

938
01:14:55,469 --> 01:14:57,012
"...no steady job."

939
01:14:57,137 --> 01:15:01,308
Pretty soon it became clear
the problem was Christo.

940
01:15:01,350 --> 01:15:02,518
Shut up!

941
01:15:04,436 --> 01:15:08,482
You see, in a shark attack,
or any other major tragedy, I guess...

942
01:15:08,565 --> 01:15:11,985
...the important thing is
to get eaten and die...

943
01:15:12,069 --> 01:15:15,656
...in which case there's a funeral
and somebody makes a speech...

944
01:15:15,739 --> 01:15:18,492
...and everybody says
what a good guy you were.

945
01:15:18,575 --> 01:15:20,661
Or get better...

946
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:23,205
...in which case everyone
can forget about it.

947
01:15:23,288 --> 01:15:26,834
- I can't take this.
- Christo, please!

948
01:15:26,917 --> 01:15:31,422
"..Every two or three autumns."

949
01:15:31,505 --> 01:15:33,966
Great atmosphere

950
01:15:35,134 --> 01:15:38,137
Get better or die.

951
01:15:38,220 --> 01:15:41,932
It's the hanging around in between
that really pisses people off.

952
01:15:42,015 --> 01:15:45,144
Listen to me.
You can't do this.

953
01:15:45,185 --> 01:15:47,271
This is disgusting!

954
01:15:47,354 --> 01:15:49,356
Take him back!

955
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:52,735
- OK, just here.
- Fucking animals!

956
01:15:55,195 --> 01:15:57,740
What are you doing this for? Huh?

957
01:15:57,823 --> 01:15:59,992
Tell me!

958
01:16:00,075 --> 01:16:02,327
How can you do this?

959
01:16:07,541 --> 01:16:09,585
Richard!

960
01:16:11,879 --> 01:16:13,964
Fucking bastards!

961
01:16:15,799 --> 01:16:17,718
Bastards!

962
01:16:17,801 --> 01:16:22,931
It would be a lot easier to condemn our
behaviour if it hadn't been so effective.

963
01:16:23,015 --> 01:16:25,058
But out of sight...

964
01:16:25,142 --> 01:16:27,227
...really was out of mind.

965
01:16:27,311 --> 01:16:29,396
Once he was gone...

966
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:31,565
...we felt a whole lot better.

967
01:16:33,025 --> 01:16:36,153
On the beach,
it's easy to turn your back...

968
01:16:36,236 --> 01:16:38,739
...but not always so easy to forget.

969
01:17:19,863 --> 01:17:24,993
Pay them in dollars, fuck their daughters,
and turn it into Wonderland, Richard!

970
01:17:27,162 --> 01:17:29,581
Richard. Come with me.

971
01:17:41,426 --> 01:17:44,304
Is that, or is that not...

972
01:17:45,472 --> 01:17:47,557
...a map she's holding?

973
01:17:49,393 --> 01:17:50,852
And did you...

974
01:17:50,936 --> 01:17:53,021
...or did you not...

975
01:17:54,064 --> 01:17:55,649
...make that copy?

976
01:17:57,776 --> 01:18:00,654
You know,
the lying doesn't bother me.

977
01:18:01,530 --> 01:18:03,365
But that map...

978
01:18:03,490 --> 01:18:04,950
...is trouble!

979
01:18:05,033 --> 01:18:08,787
The farmers, right?
You remember, those men with guns?

980
01:18:08,870 --> 01:18:10,956
They said to us, they told us...

981
01:18:11,039 --> 01:18:12,916
..."No more people."

982
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:16,878
And now it looks like we're
handing out fucking tour guides!

983
01:18:18,922 --> 01:18:20,966
Sal. I mean...

984
01:18:21,967 --> 01:18:25,595
We could explain, right?
I mean, we could tell 'em it was Daffy.

985
01:18:26,513 --> 01:18:28,598
We could explain?!

986
01:18:32,728 --> 01:18:35,856
I want you up here every day
until those people come.

987
01:18:35,939 --> 01:18:38,400
- Here?
- Yes, here.

988
01:18:38,483 --> 01:18:40,527
I want you to get the map back.

989
01:18:40,610 --> 01:18:43,280
OK? Whatever happens,
you get the map back.

990
01:18:43,363 --> 01:18:44,698
W-Wait! Sal!

991
01:18:44,781 --> 01:18:47,701
- Sal, they could be there for weeks!
- That's right.

992
01:18:47,784 --> 01:18:52,122
- And you'll be here, waiting for them.
- What am I supposed to do when they come?

993
01:18:52,205 --> 01:18:53,832
Get the map!

994
01:18:53,915 --> 01:18:58,336
You drew it! You handed it out!
Now you get it back and turn them away!

995
01:19:00,672 --> 01:19:03,091
Sal! Sal!

996
01:19:06,094 --> 01:19:08,764
Are you gonna tell
'em what else I did?

997
01:19:16,813 --> 01:19:19,399
Now this was truly a pain in the ass.

998
01:19:19,483 --> 01:19:23,111
I didn't want these people to
come here anymore than Sal did.

999
01:19:23,195 --> 01:19:25,739
But what exactly did
she expect me to do?

1000
01:19:25,822 --> 01:19:28,992
Chase them away? Threaten them?
I mean, with what?

1001
01:19:29,075 --> 01:19:33,205
By the time these kids go there,
I'd probably have starved to death.

1002
01:19:35,373 --> 01:19:36,625
Sal?

1003
01:19:36,708 --> 01:19:39,961
- Sal, is that you? Get that light outta...
- You're a pig!

1004
01:19:40,045 --> 01:19:43,340
Dammit! What the fuck was that for?
There's nothing I can do!

1005
01:19:43,423 --> 01:19:46,343
- I have to stay up here!
- Not that, OK?

1006
01:19:47,177 --> 01:19:50,138
- What is it, then?
- You and Sal in Ko Pha-Ngan.

1007
01:19:52,974 --> 01:19:54,226
Oh, that.

1008
01:19:54,309 --> 01:19:57,062
Yeah, that!
She has told everyone!

1009
01:19:57,145 --> 01:19:59,231
And me, I'm the last one to find out!

1010
01:19:59,314 --> 01:20:02,067
At least she believes in honesty.
Not like you.

1011
01:20:05,904 --> 01:20:07,989
I mean, Francoise, I...

1012
01:20:08,073 --> 01:20:10,200
What... what can I say?

1013
01:20:11,159 --> 01:20:13,662
Nothing. There's nothing you can say.

1014
01:20:19,292 --> 01:20:21,044
Thank you

1015
01:20:21,127 --> 01:20:24,005
Thank you for making
my life just perfect

1016
01:20:25,924 --> 01:20:27,509
Super

1017
01:20:28,093 --> 01:20:30,178
God...

1018
01:20:30,262 --> 01:20:32,305
...dammit!

1019
01:20:32,806 --> 01:20:34,891
Shit!

1020
01:20:36,351 --> 01:20:38,436
You are such an idiot!

1021
01:20:42,065 --> 01:20:45,694
Even though I knew it would happen...
I was crushed.

1022
01:20:46,611 --> 01:20:48,697
And I guess I deserved it.

1023
01:20:48,780 --> 01:20:51,908
I coulda given her all
the excuses she wanted...

1024
01:20:51,992 --> 01:20:54,452
...but it wouldn't have
made any difference.

1025
01:20:55,203 --> 01:20:57,289
Great Great

1026
01:20:59,958 --> 01:21:02,919
At first, I thought I
was gonna die up here...

1027
01:21:03,003 --> 01:21:05,422
...that my entire world was gonna end.

1028
01:21:11,052 --> 01:21:13,138
But it didn't.

1029
01:21:23,690 --> 01:21:24,838
In fact...

1030
01:21:25,350 --> 01:21:29,485
pretty soon, I found that there were
plenty of other things to keep me occupied.

1031
01:21:30,071 --> 01:21:32,198
And before I knew it...

1032
01:21:32,282 --> 01:21:34,951
...I found that love, like grief...

1033
01:21:35,618 --> 01:21:37,704
...tends to fade away...

1034
01:21:37,787 --> 01:21:40,832
...and be replaced by
something more exciting.

1035
01:21:46,254 --> 01:21:49,758
And life up on the hill turned
out to be a big improvement.

1036
01:21:49,841 --> 01:21:52,343
I mean, up here,
I could do what ever I wanted.

1037
01:21:52,427 --> 01:21:54,778
There was no fishing duty,
no gardening shit,

1038
01:21:54,779 --> 01:21:57,768
no hassle from Bugs or
Etienne or Francoise.

1039
01:21:58,349 --> 01:22:00,435
I was playing my own game now.

1040
01:22:01,227 --> 01:22:03,938
And I had absolutely
no reason to go back.

1041
01:22:51,152 --> 01:22:53,404
OK, so I was just foolin' around.

1042
01:22:56,282 --> 01:23:01,246
But the longer I stayed away from
the community... the less I missed them.

1043
01:23:12,549 --> 01:23:14,634
And I found new players.

1044
01:23:15,969 --> 01:23:18,304
Even if they didn't know it yet.

1045
01:24:10,398 --> 01:24:12,483
This forest was my territory.

1046
01:24:17,071 --> 01:24:19,657
Retrieving the map...
my mission.

1047
01:24:23,828 --> 01:24:25,913
And these...

1048
01:24:25,997 --> 01:24:28,082
...my defenders.

1049
01:24:30,835 --> 01:24:33,337
I was the only one
with the overview...

1050
01:24:34,589 --> 01:24:37,508
...of how it all fitted together.

1051
01:24:40,011 --> 01:24:42,096
The island.

1052
01:24:44,098 --> 01:24:46,184
Me.

1053
01:24:47,602 --> 01:24:49,687
Them.

1054
01:24:51,481 --> 01:24:53,566
The invaders.

1055
01:25:00,114 --> 01:25:02,742
All connected.

1056
01:25:03,576 --> 01:25:05,661
All playing the same game.

1057
01:25:09,999 --> 01:25:12,126
And at the centre of it all...

1058
01:25:12,210 --> 01:25:13,711
...one man:

1059
01:25:18,091 --> 01:25:19,425
...Daffy.

1060
01:25:38,820 --> 01:25:40,863
Inside!

1061
01:25:44,492 --> 01:25:47,328
Take a look, Richard!

1062
01:25:47,411 --> 01:25:49,205
Viruses, Richard!

1063
01:25:49,288 --> 01:25:50,665
Cancers!

1064
01:25:50,748 --> 01:25:54,919
The big, chunky Charlie's eating
up the whole world! Out there!

1065
01:25:56,295 --> 01:25:59,715
Down on the beach! Down on
the street! Pay them in dollars...

1066
01:25:59,799 --> 01:26:03,094
...and fuck their daughters!

1067
01:26:04,136 --> 01:26:05,805
It starts with four!

1068
01:26:05,888 --> 01:26:08,516
Four! But they multiply!
They multiply!

1069
01:26:08,599 --> 01:26:11,060
It's time to stop them!

1070
01:26:13,980 --> 01:26:15,606
Year zero, kiddo!

1071
01:26:17,233 --> 01:26:19,360
Year zero!

1072
01:26:19,777 --> 01:26:21,862
Are you with me
or against me?

1073
01:26:22,405 --> 01:26:24,490
I'm with ya all the way, Daffy!

1074
01:26:26,993 --> 01:26:30,746
Ye-ea-ah! Yeah! Yeah!

1075
01:26:46,721 --> 01:26:48,180
Richard?

1076
01:26:48,264 --> 01:26:49,599
Yeah...

1077
01:26:49,682 --> 01:26:51,767
Where you been, man?!

1078
01:26:53,561 --> 01:26:56,147
What are you doing,
sitting in the dark?

1079
01:26:56,772 --> 01:26:59,108
Improving my night vision.

1080
01:26:59,191 --> 01:27:01,277
What for, mate?

1081
01:27:02,403 --> 01:27:04,488
You know who I think about a lot?

1082
01:27:06,365 --> 01:27:08,451
I have no idea.

1083
01:27:12,496 --> 01:27:14,040
Daffy.

1084
01:27:14,999 --> 01:27:16,834
Daffy?

1085
01:27:16,917 --> 01:27:18,419
Uh-huh.

1086
01:27:22,381 --> 01:27:24,508
I admire him.

1087
01:27:25,634 --> 01:27:28,012
You hardly knew him.

1088
01:27:28,804 --> 01:27:30,848
True...

1089
01:27:32,558 --> 01:27:34,685
But he had a certain style.

1090
01:27:40,316 --> 01:27:42,985
Come here!

1091
01:27:43,069 --> 01:27:45,071
Fucking come here!

1092
01:27:45,613 --> 01:27:48,449
Yes! They're talking about you.

1093
01:27:52,912 --> 01:27:56,874
- You're moaning, that's all.
- I'm not moaning.

1094
01:27:56,957 --> 01:28:01,128
- I need to find out what his problem is.
- Do you think I like the guy?

1095
01:28:01,253 --> 01:28:05,299
- What does he do all day?
- He does no work in garden.

1096
01:28:05,382 --> 01:28:07,927
But he steals our food.
I'm sure of it.

1097
01:28:08,010 --> 01:28:09,887
You hear what they're saying?

1098
01:28:09,970 --> 01:28:12,890
Idle, sponging, useless prick!

1099
01:28:13,891 --> 01:28:16,519
Now, get your fucking act together.

1100
01:28:16,602 --> 01:28:19,730
You can't run around in the
dark not talking to nobody.

1101
01:28:19,772 --> 01:28:23,400
What do you think you're playing at, man?
What's happened to you?

1102
01:28:23,484 --> 01:28:26,737
You was all right. Just a couple
of weeks ago, you was fine.

1103
01:28:26,821 --> 01:28:28,739
And now, what the fuck is going on?

1104
01:28:28,823 --> 01:28:30,908
Look at you!

1105
01:28:30,950 --> 01:28:33,035
And you're talking about Daffy?!

1106
01:28:33,119 --> 01:28:37,039
Daffy was a nutter, right? He went
out there and he lost it. He's gone!

1107
01:28:37,081 --> 01:28:39,166
Richard!

1108
01:28:39,708 --> 01:28:41,794
Richard!

1109
01:28:41,919 --> 01:28:44,046
Do you hear what
I'm saying to you?

1110
01:28:45,047 --> 01:28:47,716
Don't lose it like him.
Do ya understand?

1111
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:50,511
Don't go there! Stay with us.
Come back, Rich!

1112
01:28:50,594 --> 01:28:54,139
These are good people. They don't
talk about people all the time.

1113
01:28:54,223 --> 01:28:57,518
They're talking about you
because you're fucked up!

1114
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:06,485
...too much sensation.

1115
01:29:12,449 --> 01:29:14,535
...got outta control.

1116
01:29:22,084 --> 01:29:26,714
And now it looks like we're
handing out fucking tour guides!

1117
01:29:44,273 --> 01:29:46,358
Mushroom, Richard?

1118
01:29:48,444 --> 01:29:50,529
No, thank you, Daffy.

1119
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:54,408
I don't need any help to
see the writing on the wall.

1120
01:29:54,450 --> 01:29:58,037
- I'm very glad to hear that, Richard.
- Gotta keep my head clear.

1121
01:29:58,120 --> 01:30:00,706
- Getting closer, any day now.
- Year zero?

1122
01:30:00,789 --> 01:30:02,875
That's the spirit, kiddo.

1123
01:30:03,959 --> 01:30:06,045
You know somethin'?

1124
01:30:06,629 --> 01:30:08,714
You led the way, Daffy.

1125
01:30:09,798 --> 01:30:12,217
You showed me the truth.

1126
01:30:15,179 --> 01:30:19,141
But it doesn't matter what I think
any more. It's up to you now.

1127
01:30:20,100 --> 01:30:22,102
I won't let you down.

1128
01:30:22,186 --> 01:30:23,979
Hey, Richard.

1129
01:30:24,063 --> 01:30:26,148
No offense but, erm...

1130
01:30:26,231 --> 01:30:28,400
...you're fucked in the head, man.

1131
01:30:36,241 --> 01:30:39,411
It's been really nice
knowing you, Daffy.

1132
01:30:50,756 --> 01:30:54,718
We're on patrol in the Delta.
Search and destroy.

1133
01:30:56,470 --> 01:30:58,555
We're not making any contact.

1134
01:31:06,855 --> 01:31:11,735
- This lieutenant, he says to me...
- Get out there and draw their fire!

1135
01:31:11,819 --> 01:31:17,116
- It's never gonna happen, sir.
- Are you refusing an order, son?

1136
01:31:17,199 --> 01:31:22,204
- It looks that way, sir.
- "It looks that way, sir"?!

1137
01:31:23,997 --> 01:31:26,875
Then my M-16 just went off, man.

1138
01:31:26,959 --> 01:31:29,336
It just went off!

1139
01:31:29,419 --> 01:31:31,505
It just went off.

1140
01:33:41,176 --> 01:33:43,303
Let's go!

1141
01:33:43,387 --> 01:33:45,555
Come back, Sam!

1142
01:34:04,616 --> 01:34:07,536
There's no other explanation!
We're in dope heaven!

1143
01:34:12,290 --> 01:34:15,752
♪ I smoke two joints in the morning, ♪
♪ I smoke two joints at night ♪

1144

1148
01:34:41,945 --> 01:34:44,197
- Hi.
- Oh, shit!

1149
01:34:45,323 --> 01:34:47,450
We're Americans.

1150
01:34:48,910 --> 01:34:50,328
Tourists.

1151
01:34:50,412 --> 01:34:53,707
- American.
- We, uh... we... we had a... a map.

1152
01:34:53,790 --> 01:34:56,501
And we... we came here...

1153
01:34:56,626 --> 01:35:01,840
...but we made a mistake. We made a mistake.
And... and we're sorry. We'll go now.

1154
01:35:07,929 --> 01:35:10,056
- Come on...
- We go now.

1155
01:35:15,270 --> 01:35:17,355
Um...

1156
01:35:17,439 --> 01:35:20,358
- We... we just wanna go.
- Give 'em somethin'.

1157
01:35:20,442 --> 01:35:22,527
- Give 'em some money.
- Well...

1158
01:35:22,611 --> 01:35:26,197
Look! American dollars.
I got American dollars. You want...

1159
01:35:26,281 --> 01:35:28,366
...American dol... money?

1160
01:35:28,408 --> 01:35:30,493
Here...

1161
01:35:31,411 --> 01:35:33,288
- You can have them!
- Hey, hey, hey!

1162
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:35,707
Um...

1163
01:35:35,790 --> 01:35:38,877
I've... I've got my watch. It plays a tune.

1164
01:36:01,024 --> 01:36:03,109
No! No!

1165
01:38:17,535 --> 01:38:19,996
This is our sixth year!

1166
01:38:25,251 --> 01:38:27,337
I want to look ahead.

1167
01:38:28,671 --> 01:38:30,757
Because I see...

1168
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:33,801
...that beyond any problems
that we might have had...

1169
01:38:33,885 --> 01:38:35,261
Right?

1170
01:38:35,345 --> 01:38:38,306
...beyond any problems
that we might have...

1171
01:38:40,266 --> 01:38:44,187
...that we have so much
here to inspire us.

1172
01:38:45,230 --> 01:38:47,982
And I'm not just talking
about the island.

1173
01:38:50,068 --> 01:38:52,111
I'm talking about you.

1174
01:38:53,571 --> 01:38:55,823
You are what makes this place work.

1175
01:38:58,076 --> 01:39:00,161
And it does.

1176
01:39:02,246 --> 01:39:05,500
I tried to remember
the person I used to be.

1177
01:39:05,583 --> 01:39:07,669
But I just couldn't do it.

1178
01:39:07,752 --> 01:39:10,463
To the island!

1179
01:39:10,546 --> 01:39:12,215
To you!

1180
01:39:12,298 --> 01:39:14,384
And so long as I stayed here...

1181
01:39:14,467 --> 01:39:16,511
And to the future!

1182
01:39:17,512 --> 01:39:19,597
...I'd never find him again.

1183
01:39:37,198 --> 01:39:40,993
Come with me! I've gotta talk to you!
Listen! I've got to talk to you!

1184
01:39:41,077 --> 01:39:42,745
- Stop!
- Mais ca ne va pas, ou quoi!

1185
01:39:42,829 --> 01:39:44,455
- Listen!
- Mais tu me laches?!

1186
01:39:44,539 --> 01:39:46,779
I've gotta talk to you!
Stop! Francoise, listen!

1187
01:39:46,999 --> 01:39:49,180
I've gotta talk to you. Stop...

1188
01:39:49,627 --> 01:39:52,088
Dammit! Stop! Stop it!

1189
01:39:52,171 --> 01:39:54,424
Stop it! Stop it! Stop!

1190
01:39:54,507 --> 01:39:56,843
I'm not gonna hurt you! All right?

1191
01:39:56,926 --> 01:39:59,804
It's just me. It's just me - Richard.

1192
01:40:00,471 --> 01:40:02,306
Remember?

1193
01:40:02,348 --> 01:40:05,393
The guy... who can't play soccer?

1194
01:40:05,476 --> 01:40:07,603
The guy without a girlfriend?

1195
01:40:10,148 --> 01:40:11,899
I remember.

1196
01:40:12,984 --> 01:40:15,069
I've just been away for a while.

1197
01:40:15,862 --> 01:40:17,947
That's all.

1198
01:40:18,030 --> 01:40:20,116
That's all.

1199
01:40:21,075 --> 01:40:24,662
- Ils ont tue quatre personnes.
- Le crois pas.

1200
01:40:24,746 --> 01:40:25,779
Il est tare.

1201
01:40:25,779 --> 01:40:28,259
Dis pas n'importe quoipour
qu'on s'en aille!

1202
01:40:28,309 --> 01:40:30,543
- Tu crois quej'ai envie de resterici?!
- Listen!

1203
01:40:30,668 --> 01:40:35,298
Etienne, I've really fucked up! Four people
are dead. I don't know what else they'll do!

1204
01:40:35,381 --> 01:40:38,843
But we have to leave now!
That's it! Just the three of us.

1205
01:40:38,926 --> 01:40:41,846
- Just like before.
- Richard...

1206
01:40:44,223 --> 01:40:46,309
...I can't leave him.

1207
01:40:47,268 --> 01:40:50,354
- Then we'll take him with us.
- But... look at him.

1208
01:40:50,438 --> 01:40:51,731
Look at him.

1209
01:40:51,814 --> 01:40:53,900
We can't move him.

1210
01:40:53,983 --> 01:40:56,110
It's gangrene.

1211
01:40:56,194 --> 01:40:58,237
It's spreading.

1212
01:40:58,321 --> 01:40:59,780
He's gonna die.

1213
01:41:10,416 --> 01:41:12,502
Wait for me at the boat.

1214
01:41:26,474 --> 01:41:28,601
Viens, mon ange. On y va.

1215
01:41:58,256 --> 01:42:02,718
Christo had suffered because
we wouldn't let anything spoil our fun.

1216
01:42:05,346 --> 01:42:07,431
In the perfect beach resort...

1217
01:42:07,515 --> 01:42:11,352
...nothing is allowed to interrupt
the pursuit of pleasure.

1218
01:42:12,561 --> 01:42:14,647
Not even dying.

1219
01:43:27,178 --> 01:43:30,222
Do you think I want to hurt you?

1220
01:43:30,306 --> 01:43:32,808
I'm a farmer, that's all.

1221
01:43:33,976 --> 01:43:36,061
Understand?

1222
01:43:36,145 --> 01:43:38,189
I work.

1223
01:43:39,523 --> 01:43:41,609
I send the money to my family.

1224
01:43:44,570 --> 01:43:47,323
If too many people
come to this island...

1225
01:43:48,407 --> 01:43:50,493
...it's trouble for me!

1226
01:43:51,619 --> 01:43:53,996
I can't work...

1227
01:43:54,079 --> 01:43:55,831
...I can't send the money...

1228
01:43:55,915 --> 01:43:58,792
...and my family don't eat!

1229
01:44:01,003 --> 01:44:03,088
I said no more people.

1230
01:44:04,757 --> 01:44:06,842
But more people come.

1231
01:44:09,678 --> 01:44:11,764
And you...

1232
01:44:12,515 --> 01:44:14,642
You give them the map!

1233
01:44:19,813 --> 01:44:21,023
Now...

1234
01:44:21,106 --> 01:44:23,817
...you all go home.

1235
01:44:23,901 --> 01:44:27,780
Forget this island.
Forget about Thailand!

1236
01:44:27,905 --> 01:44:31,033
- Understand? Huh?
- Yeah.

1237
01:44:31,116 --> 01:44:33,327
- You understand?!
- Yeah.

1238
01:44:33,410 --> 01:44:35,496
No.

1239
01:44:35,579 --> 01:44:36,789
What?!

1240
01:44:36,872 --> 01:44:38,874
No.

1241
01:44:40,334 --> 01:44:42,419
We're not leaving.

1242
01:44:43,504 --> 01:44:45,839
This is our home, too.

1243
01:44:45,923 --> 01:44:48,342
This is our house!

1244
01:44:48,425 --> 01:44:51,971
We built it with our own hands!
And we are not leaving!

1245
01:44:53,097 --> 01:44:55,766
Come on, Sal. Sal.

1246
01:44:55,849 --> 01:44:58,978
I... I think you're making
a big mistake here.

1247
01:44:59,061 --> 01:45:00,521
Really.

1248
01:45:01,855 --> 01:45:05,567
- If he says that we should leave...
- Richard, shut up!

1249
01:45:07,611 --> 01:45:10,114
This is all your fault anyway.

1250
01:45:11,824 --> 01:45:13,909
Who copied the map, Richard?

1251
01:45:27,548 --> 01:45:29,633
You are the clever boy.

1252
01:45:30,884 --> 01:45:32,928
The one who sneak around!

1253
01:45:33,053 --> 01:45:36,598
- No, let him go!
- Steal from us! Play with our guns!

1254
01:45:36,682 --> 01:45:39,268
And you bring people here!

1255
01:46:05,711 --> 01:46:09,006
If you want to stay...

1256
01:46:13,635 --> 01:46:15,721
if you want to stay!

1257
01:46:28,901 --> 01:46:30,986
No! No!

1258
01:46:31,111 --> 01:46:32,446
No!

1259
01:46:33,155 --> 01:46:35,240
Sal... Sal!

1260
01:46:37,576 --> 01:46:39,661
- Sal...
- Fuck! Sal, no!

1261
01:46:39,745 --> 01:46:41,663
Sal... Listen.

1262
01:46:41,747 --> 01:46:44,374
- Don't be crazy, OK?
- You can't!

1263
01:46:44,458 --> 01:46:46,585
Don't be crazy, Sal. Put the gun down.

1264
01:46:46,627 --> 01:46:49,546
You let us down, Richard.
You brought us trouble.

1265
01:46:50,589 --> 01:46:54,718
- You can't, Sal! For fuck's sake!
- No, make her stop! Make her stop!

1266
01:46:56,637 --> 01:46:57,638
No!

1267
01:46:57,721 --> 01:47:01,433
- Someone help! Keaty! Someone help me!
- Let go! Get outside!

1268
01:47:01,517 --> 01:47:03,477
Help me!

1269
01:47:03,560 --> 01:47:05,562
Help me! Help me!

1270
01:47:05,687 --> 01:47:09,441
You fucking bastards! Argh!

1271
01:47:09,525 --> 01:47:10,984
No! Bugs!

1272
01:47:11,068 --> 01:47:13,111
Come on, Sal! Do it, Sal!

1273
01:47:13,195 --> 01:47:15,155
Go on, Sal!

1274
01:47:15,239 --> 01:47:18,700
You can't do it.
You can't do it, Sal.

1275
01:47:18,784 --> 01:47:21,537
- Shut up!
- Cos if you pull that trigger...

1276
01:47:21,620 --> 01:47:22,529
If you pull that trigger,

1277
01:47:22,530 --> 01:47:25,832
- it's all fuckin' over and you know it!
- Come on.

1278
01:47:25,882 --> 01:47:27,143
Cos this time...

1279
01:47:27,793 --> 01:47:31,585
this time it's not like Christo rotting out
in the woods where no one could see!

1280
01:47:31,635 --> 01:47:34,800
It's not like the four people
that I saw killed today!

1281
01:47:34,883 --> 01:47:36,969
This time...

1282
01:47:37,678 --> 01:47:39,888
...everyone has to watch, Sal.

1283
01:47:40,681 --> 01:47:45,519
Everyone has to see what it takes
to keep our little "paradise" a secret.

1284
01:47:46,687 --> 01:47:48,730
- C'mon, everyone! Watch!
- Shut up!

1285
01:47:48,772 --> 01:47:51,650
Everyone watch Sal do this!
Go on, Sal, do it.

1286
01:47:51,733 --> 01:47:53,902
Come on! Come on, do it! Yeah!

1287
01:47:53,986 --> 01:47:58,156
Let 'em see the blood this time, huh? Huh?
Let's see if they can take it.

1288
01:47:58,240 --> 01:47:59,449
God!

1289
01:48:04,580 --> 01:48:06,873
They can take it.

1290
01:48:40,240 --> 01:48:42,159
No! No...

1291
01:48:42,242 --> 01:48:44,244
No! No!

1292
01:48:50,792 --> 01:48:52,878
C'mon, hold on to me.

1293
01:49:07,309 --> 01:49:09,394
Game over.

1294
01:49:11,021 --> 01:49:13,106
But she was never gonna leave.

1295
01:49:14,107 --> 01:49:17,486
She believed in it all
way too much to ever change.

1296
01:49:18,361 --> 01:49:20,697
