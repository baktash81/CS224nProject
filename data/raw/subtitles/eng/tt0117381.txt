1
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,605
First day of law school,
my professor says two things.

2
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:24,816
First, "From now on, when
your mother says she loves you,"

3
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,778
- "get a second opinion."
- And?

4
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:32,199
"You want justice, go to a whorehouse.
Wanna get fucked, go to court."

5
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:33,992
Naomi!

6
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:35,744
Let's say you have a client
you know is guilty.

7
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:40,040
No. Neither our justice system
nor I care about that.

8
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:42,835
Every defendant,
regardless of what he's done,

9
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,379
has the right to the best defence
his attorney can provide.

10
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:50,926
- Where were you with the truth?
- Truth? How do you mean?

11
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:52,970
Naomi!

12
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:56,056
I'm not sure how many ways
there are to mean it.

13
00:00:56,265 --> 00:00:59,184
- You think there's only one?
- You're late.

14
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:04,523
- There's only one that matters.
- Marty, hold still.

15
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:09,486
My version of it. The one I create
in the minds of the twelve jurors.

16
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:14,074
If you want, you can call it
something else. The illusion of truth.

17
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:16,994
- If you want. It's up to you.
- OK.

18
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,041
Jack, you need more?
Tomorrow afternoon?

19
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,587
- Yeah.
- I'll have my secretary set it up.

20
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,172
OK.

21
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,970
- This is a cover story, right?
- Yeah.

22
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:35,804
Yeah. OK, bye.

23
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:45,976
St. Michael's Boys Choir, thank you.
A very talented group.

24
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:49,605
Right now, we're gonna have
a brief photo session

25
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:52,191
while we have the boys here
with His Excellency.

26
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:57,863
I'll be back in a few minutes. Bear with
us, enjoy your dessert and thank you.

27
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:13,337
Mangia, mangia.

28
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,641
Thanks. Marty!
What an unexpected surprise.

29
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:28,310
I'm here to help our friendly prosecutor
off the hook.

30
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:31,438
- Excuse me.
- What's it gonna cost?

31
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:34,566
A lot less than the alternative.

32
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:37,986
Tomorrow. My office. 9:30.

33
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,783
- Is this on? Yes, it is.
- Nice to see you again.

34
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:47,788
We have come to the heart of
the matter. Why we're here tonight.

35
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,749
It's the fifth straight year
it's been my privilege

36
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:55,337
to serve as master of ceremony
for the Chicago Bar Association...

37
00:04:55,546 --> 00:05:00,217
- I'm afraid you'll have to put that out.
- It's a bar for Christ's sake.

38
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:09,518
I thought you quit.

39
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,854
I cut down.

40
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:16,441
You look beautiful. Cut your hair?

41
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,527
Yeah, a few months ago.

42
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:23,323
Wanna dance?

43
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:27,411
- There isn't any music.
- I'm sure there is.

44
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,425
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen...

45
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,970
All you have to do is turn around.

46
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:47,139
I thought you liked it better like this.

47
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,975
That way you don't have
to look at the person.

48
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:51,727
Mean.

49
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:55,480
Look at me.

50
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,905
Come on. Let's go find a bar
you can still smoke in.

51
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:06,867
Thanks for the invite, but I don't like
one-night stands all that much.

52
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:10,704
We saw each other for months.

53
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:16,376
It was a one-night stand, Marty.
It just lasted six months.

54
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:33,185
Well, I must say I haven't seen
this many lawyers and politicians

55
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:37,564
gathered together in one place
since confession this morning.

56
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,912
There is no way the People
will tolerate a monetary award

57
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,040
to a cockroach
who deserves twenty-to-life.

58
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:59,211
He may be your client, but Joey Pinero
was a hard-case felon.

59
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:03,757
- Dealing, racketeering, money...
- Did you say "alleged", Yancy?

60
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:06,176
Did you hear him say "alleged"?

61
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:08,679
Mr Pinero has never
been convicted of anything.

62
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:12,516
The cops left him bleeding in the snow.
A miracle he survived.

63
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:17,062
Having said that,
I'm not opposed to a settlement.

64
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:21,275
1 ,500,000 and Pinero leaves the state.

65
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,949
You can't limit a citizen's right
to live where he wants to.

66
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,534
Legally, that's unenforceable.

67
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:33,704
Enforceable or just
a gentleman's agreement,

68
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,914
Mr Pinero will know what we want.

69
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:43,130
Get the answer you're looking for,
don't sit around and chat. A pleasure.

70
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:45,924
You're worse
than the thugs you represent.

71
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,969
- That's enough, Bud. It's over.
- I have to run this by him.

72
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:53,640
You're on a 40% commission. I'm sure
your recommendation will prevail.

73
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:56,393
Thank you, John.

74
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:56,995
Oh, Jesus.

75
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,270
- Hey, Mr Vail.
- How are you doing?

76
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:15,199
Buena.

77
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:19,453
Nice tune.

78
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:24,166
- Traeme dos tequilas por aqui.
- Bien, m'hijito.

79
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:28,295
So, what did they say?

80
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:33,842
A take-it-or-leave-it offer of 1 ,500,000.
From Shaughnessy himself.

81
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,471
What do you think?

82
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:44,019
We should take it. Unless you wanna
spend two years in appellate court.

83
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:47,814
- No, fuck that. Close it.
- Done.

84
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:52,569
- OK.
- Gracias.

85
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:55,155
- Salud.
- Salud.

86
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:00,869
- Mia?
- Your shot.

87
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:05,249
There's one more little thing.

88
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,794
They want you to leave the state.

89
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,925
- They want you to disappear.
- Disappear?

90
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,219
That's good. Same bullshit, right?

91
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:20,764
What? What are you talking about?

92
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:25,727
I keep getting these offers
from these guys, Marty.

93
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:27,437
What offers?

94
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:32,359
A couple of months ago
a cop walks in here. He says,

95
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:37,322
"You testify against Alderman
Martinez, and we'll owe you, Joey."

96
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:41,493
Say he did you favours,
say he's on your payroll.

97
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:45,330
So I tell him to go fuck himself.
Martinez is a good man.

98
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:46,915
He's the one holding out

99
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:50,294
while the others try to turn South River
into high-rent condos.

100
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:54,131
- Why didn't you tell me this before?
- Why?

101
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,175
'Cause this shit happens every day.

102
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,468
I didn't think
it had anything to do with this.

103
00:11:58,677 --> 00:12:01,138
- You don't.
- I've spent a lot of money here.

104
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:03,390
- They spent more.
- I built a clinic here.

105
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:05,058
These people depend on me.

106
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:08,353
I don't give a shit.
Send them cheques from California.

107
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:16,653
Chucho, hazme el favor,
scame el CD.

108
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:21,783
I respect your advice, Marty,
but I can't take it.

109
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:26,830
- I'll take the money, but I ain't going.
- I don't like it, Joey.

110
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:30,959
Chucho, dame.
So, what are they gonna do? Kill me?

111
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:33,462
They've tried once.

112
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,673
How are they gonna kill
a man who never sleeps?

113
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:39,510
- Get the money.
- You're too much.

114
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:44,014
That song you liked, fourth cut.

115
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,808
Very nice, thank you.

116
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:10,165
Police'll have their hands full...

117
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:14,211
- Captain, can you tell us anything?
- I don't know anything.

118
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,547
Captain Stenner, what's going on?

119
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:20,926
I haven't seen anything yet. As soon
as I've been inside, I'll tell you.

120
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:43,991
You should be home in bed, Abel.
It's going around.

121
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:46,326
I'll consider that, Harvey.

122
00:13:50,289 --> 00:13:53,667
Christ. What a mess, huh?.

123
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:16,190
- Sam, you got all you need?
- Roll him over.

124
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:29,995
Hey, stop!

125
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:32,998
Four fingers severed.

126
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:39,713
A symbol, B 32.1 56,
is carved into the chest.

127
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:48,805
Body temperature is still warm...

128
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:51,683
Captain, we've got
a live one on the run.

129
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:16,166
A passing train has separated
the suspect...

130
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,544
You want to know what I hate?

131
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:23,632
When they go on and on about what
big whores defence attorneys are.

132
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:26,218
We're the bad guys? You know why?

133
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:29,346
We sit next to some creep,
we start to look creepy.

134
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:33,225
They assume they're guilty,
like we know it or something.

135
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:38,105
You don't know, you don't ask,
you don't care. You do the damn job.

136
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:41,316
It's not like they're your friends
for Christ's sake.

137
00:15:42,568 --> 00:15:45,195
Well, some are your friends, but...

138
00:15:55,414 --> 00:15:57,916
Why did you leave
the State Attorney's office?

139
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,835
Dead-end job.

140
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:06,675
You can either run for office
or end up a judge.

141
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:09,511
Why become an umpire
when you can play ball?

142
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,432
...around St. Michael's
and the Archbishop's mansion...

143
00:16:31,617 --> 00:16:34,244
Over here! He's over here!

144
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:43,962
We will of course stay with this story
as it continues to unfold.

145
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:48,592
What we do know is that
approx. 1 1:08 this morning...

146
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,720
So when did you know you had them?

147
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:55,849
What? Sorry?

148
00:16:56,058 --> 00:17:00,979
When during the Pinero trial did you
say to yourself, "I've got them"?

149
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:03,190
The day I took the case. Excuse me.

150
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:07,402
The shocking murder of one
of Chicago's most beloved figures,

151
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:11,281
Archbishop Richard Rushman,
has left the cityjust numb.

152
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,450
I understand we have Andy live.

153
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:17,746
We havejust learned the police
have arrested a 19-year-old man

154
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:21,708
identified as Aaron Stampler.
According to Captain Stenner...

155
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:25,921
We have to reschedule.
Call my office, OK? I'm sorry.

156
00:17:33,512 --> 00:17:37,140
- Law offices of Martin Vail.
- You got the news on by any chance?

157
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:39,893
Call Sullivan in Judge Trutter's office.

158
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:42,479
Find out where he is,
and call me at the Alibi.

159
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:44,398
- A lot ofguys'll want this one.
- OK.

160
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:50,028
The police have taken the first steps,
acting with speed, with the arrest.

161
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:15,596
- Are you taking the Stampler case?
- I'm sorry, I can't talk right now.

162
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:24,479
- State Attorney left yet?
- Yeah, Yancy no less.

163
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:26,273
- PD?
- Come and gone.

164
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:28,233
Lock up!

165
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:31,820
- Give my best to your brother.
- Yeah, sure.

166
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:35,407
I'd like to see him alone if I could.

167
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:38,785
- All right, but I'll have to lock you in.
- Understood.

168
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:09,066
You know who I am?

169
00:19:10,943 --> 00:19:13,737
No, no, sir. No, I don't.

170
00:19:13,946 --> 00:19:18,617
My name is Martin Vail.
I'm what you call a big-shot attorney.

171
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:23,914
-I don't... I don't have no money.
- I didn't think you did.

172
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:26,667
I'm willing to take
your case pro bono,

173
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:30,712
which means you get all of
my expertise and hard work for free.

174
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:36,885
Or you can get the 40,000-a-year
court-appointed public defender,

175
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:41,139
who will almost certainly
escort you to death row. Your choice.

176
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:47,187
No, sir. I'd surely be grateful
for anything you can do.

177
00:19:47,396 --> 00:19:49,356
You're welcome.

178
00:19:49,565 --> 00:19:52,901
Now, your full name is...?

179
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:56,238
My... Aaron Luke Sta...

180
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:59,825
Stampler.

181
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:02,286
Stampler.

182
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:07,082
- You from Kentucky, Aaron?
- Yes, sir. I'm from Creekside.

183
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:11,003
- Does it say that there?
- No.

184
00:20:12,504 --> 00:20:15,591
How long have you been
here in Chicago?

185
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:20,220
Two years next month, I think.

186
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:24,141
- Have you been arrested?
- No, sir.

187
00:20:27,728 --> 00:20:30,439
How do you know the Archbishop?

188
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:38,197
I was begging on the street,
up on the Wacker Drive.

189
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:44,453
Bishop Rushman came by
in his Cadillac.

190
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:48,123
He saw me and he stopped.

191
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,376
He took me into Savior House.

192
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:54,087
I work as an altar boy.

193
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:56,715
And I sing in his choir.

194
00:20:56,924 --> 00:20:59,885
How long were you there, Aaron,
Savior House?

195
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:01,762
A year. Year and a half.

196
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:06,099
You're supposed to leave
when you're 1 8, but...

197
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:11,605
But Bishop Rushman let me stay on
way past my 1 9th birthday.

198
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:14,900
That was nice of him.

199
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:20,447
Yes. Yes, it was.

200
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:26,119
Aaron, did you have any reason
to dislike the Archbishop?

201
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:29,540
Dislike? No, no, sir.

202
00:21:29,748 --> 00:21:32,918
He was like a father to me.

203
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:35,128
Yeah, but you...

204
00:21:36,755 --> 00:21:39,633
How am I gonna say this?

205
00:21:39,842 --> 00:21:42,970
Were you in the room
when he was murdered?

206
00:21:45,556 --> 00:21:48,684
How can you explain that?

207
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:52,020
There was someone else
in that room, Mr Vail.

208
00:21:54,273 --> 00:21:56,066
- There was a third person?
- Yes, sir.

209
00:21:56,275 --> 00:21:58,777
- Did you tell the police this?
- Yes, I did.

210
00:21:58,986 --> 00:22:02,531
- But they didn't believe me.
- All right. You tell me now.

211
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:06,785
I was returning a book

212
00:22:06,994 --> 00:22:09,580
to Bishop Rushman's library.

213
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:15,586
I heard a noise,
so I went back into his bedroom.

214
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:20,924
Bishop Rushman
was lying on the floor.

215
00:22:21,842 --> 00:22:25,512
There was blood all over everýthing.

216
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:30,434
Then I saw the shadow.
I saw a person

217
00:22:30,642 --> 00:22:33,562
Ieaning over Bishop Rushman.

218
00:22:34,646 --> 00:22:39,109
He looked up, and he came at me.
And that's when I lost time.

219
00:22:40,903 --> 00:22:43,822
What does that mean? Lost time?

220
00:22:44,031 --> 00:22:47,367
I bla... I blacked out.

221
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:50,871
It happens to me sometimes.

222
00:22:52,581 --> 00:22:55,083
I have...

223
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:58,378
..spells. I have spells.

224
00:22:58,587 --> 00:23:00,881
I lose time.

225
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:04,843
I can't remember nothing.

226
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:13,560
Why did you run from the police,
Aaron, if you didn't do anything wrong?

227
00:23:13,769 --> 00:23:19,566
Well, when I woke up,
I was covered in blood.

228
00:23:19,775 --> 00:23:21,777
I didn't know what to do.

229
00:23:21,985 --> 00:23:25,364
I got scared,
I heard sirens, so I ran.

230
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:28,742
Look, I know how it looks, Mr Vail,
but I swear...

231
00:23:28,951 --> 00:23:32,663
I don't need you to convince me.
Just answer my questions.

232
00:23:32,871 --> 00:23:37,459
- I didn't do this. You got to believe me.
- No, I don't. I don't care.

233
00:23:37,668 --> 00:23:42,130
I am your attorney, which means
I'm your mother, your father,

234
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:45,050
your best friend and your priest.

235
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,804
I don't want you talking
to anyone but me.

236
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:52,516
Not the cops, the press,
the guys in the cells, nobody,

237
00:23:52,724 --> 00:23:54,810
without my permission.
You understand?

238
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:58,272
- Yeah?
- Yes. Yes, I do.

239
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,693
All right. Now the important stuff.
What's your suit size?

240
00:24:04,945 --> 00:24:08,448
- My what?
- Suit size. What are you? A 38"?

241
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:17,249
- I don't know.
- Well, a 38" Iong.

242
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:23,839
The police flushed Stampler from
his hiding place behind the Cathedral.

243
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:27,509
They chased him through
the train yard, almost losing him

244
00:24:27,718 --> 00:24:32,389
as he scrambled over tracks before
an oncoming train separated them.

245
00:24:32,598 --> 00:24:35,934
Prominent local criminal
defence attorney Martin Vail

246
00:24:36,143 --> 00:24:38,937
is believed to have visited Stampler
at the Maxwell Street ...

247
00:24:39,146 --> 00:24:42,816
After a brief chase across the rail yard
behind St. Michael's Cathedral,

248
00:24:43,025 --> 00:24:46,403
Stampler was apprehended
in a hole beneath train tracks...

249
00:24:46,612 --> 00:24:50,741
- Are you defending this man?
- I'm sorry...

250
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:53,619
Thank you very much. Thank you.

251
00:24:54,453 --> 00:24:56,622
We've taken the first step
in the process.

252
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,957
I can now take your questions.

253
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:03,337
Shaughnessy, what about the
altar boy group Stampler was part of?

254
00:25:03,545 --> 00:25:04,880
Not much at this time.

255
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:07,341
Could other altar boys be involved?

256
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:10,344
We have no reason to suspect
anyone other than Stampler.

257
00:25:10,552 --> 00:25:14,431
He had access to the Archbishop's
quarters. He was caught as he fled.

258
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,809
The blood-soaked Aaron Stampler
was chased under McCormick Place,

259
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:21,772
but not before he was almost killed
by a passing train.

260
00:25:23,357 --> 00:25:27,194
He's gonna call you
as soon as he gets here. Thank you.

261
00:25:27,402 --> 00:25:29,780
- Naomi!
- Yeah.

262
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:31,782
Sorry, I'm late.
We have a new client.

263
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:34,868
- I was afraid you were gonna say that.
- Who?

264
00:25:35,077 --> 00:25:38,747
You know what they're calling him?
The Butcher Boy of St. Mike's.

265
00:25:38,956 --> 00:25:41,416
- I like that.
- You'll be hearing it a lot.

266
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:44,044
Is the kid who chopped up
the Archbishop our client?

267
00:25:44,253 --> 00:25:48,966
You have to get "allegedly" into your
vocabulary if you want to be a lawyer.

268
00:25:49,174 --> 00:25:51,093
- Coffee, Tommy?
- No, thanks.

269
00:25:51,301 --> 00:25:55,931
He admits he was in the room when
the killing occurred, but he didn't see it.

270
00:25:56,139 --> 00:25:59,643
- Can I stop you right there?
- No. He was returning a book.

271
00:25:59,852 --> 00:26:02,646
He heard loud noises in the bedroom.

272
00:26:02,855 --> 00:26:07,734
He went in. He sees a figure in
the shadows, kneeling over the body.

273
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:10,529
He blacks out. Next thing he knows,

274
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:13,073
sirens are screaming,
he's covered in blood.

275
00:26:13,282 --> 00:26:17,286
The cops find him in a train tunnel.
He's got the Archbishop's ring on him.

276
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:20,789
- He stole the Archbishop's ring?
- No, it was in his pocket.

277
00:26:25,252 --> 00:26:27,337
Is that it?

278
00:26:29,673 --> 00:26:31,383
Yep.

279
00:26:32,885 --> 00:26:34,261
That's...

280
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:39,349
That's the worst bullshit story
I've heard in my entire life.

281
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:41,977
Now it's our bullshit story.

282
00:26:42,186 --> 00:26:44,813
OK. Let's get to work.

283
00:26:45,022 --> 00:26:49,568
The name of the game is "motive".
The Prosecution doesn't have one.

284
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:53,363
We have to prove that someone
else could have committed the crime,

285
00:26:53,572 --> 00:26:55,365
then we can establish
reasonable doubt.

286
00:26:55,574 --> 00:26:58,285
I want to know everýthing I can
about this guy.

287
00:26:58,493 --> 00:27:02,206
Go to Database,
go to Hall of Records, IRS files.

288
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:06,335
- Even so-called charities.
- So-called? He was a priest.

289
00:27:08,337 --> 00:27:15,219
Naomi, write this down. B 32.1 56. It
was carved into the Archbishop's chest.

290
00:27:15,427 --> 00:27:17,763
- Allegedly.
- No, that was a fact.

291
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:20,682
- But I appreciate the effort.
- Thanks.

292
00:27:21,308 --> 00:27:26,021
I also need case histories on murder
by stabbing, mutilation and religion.

293
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:29,274
- Also I'm gonna need a psychiatrist.
- You're telling me.

294
00:27:29,483 --> 00:27:33,153
Not the kind who lives
in a witness box. I need a real one.

295
00:27:33,362 --> 00:27:37,366
- And an expert on amnesia.
- What does he look like in person?

296
00:27:37,574 --> 00:27:39,409
The Butcher Boy?

297
00:27:41,453 --> 00:27:44,331
- Like a boy scout.
- A boy scout...

298
00:27:45,415 --> 00:27:48,043
..with a merit badge in carving.

299
00:27:48,627 --> 00:27:51,672
The Archbishop was
a close friend of Mr Shaughnessy.

300
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,550
He asked me who my best man was.

301
00:27:54,758 --> 00:27:57,135
- I said you.
- Thank you.

302
00:27:58,303 --> 00:28:00,514
I trust if I'm to prosecute this case,

303
00:28:00,722 --> 00:28:03,851
I'll get the authority
which comes with it.

304
00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:06,311
You're the one trying the case.

305
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,898
But let's establish one thing
at the outset. I want the death penalty.

306
00:28:11,942 --> 00:28:16,488
I'd like to go over the case before we
determine whether or not to seek that.

307
00:28:16,697 --> 00:28:21,618
I'm open to anything you have to say,
but in my mind there's no debate.

308
00:28:22,786 --> 00:28:25,539
Did the boy they picked up
say anything?

309
00:28:25,747 --> 00:28:28,333
Yeah, he didn't do it.

310
00:28:28,542 --> 00:28:32,004
- It's a slam dunk, Janet.
- Excuse me.

311
00:28:32,212 --> 00:28:35,382
I appreciate your faith in me.
I don't mean to be argumentative.

312
00:28:35,591 --> 00:28:39,511
- It's what we pay you for.
- Open and shut, you don't need me.

313
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,807
The PD'll plead no contest and throw
the kid on the mercy of the court.

314
00:28:44,516 --> 00:28:46,768
There's not a public defender.

315
00:28:46,977 --> 00:28:51,231
He's got a lawyer? Already? Who?

316
00:28:55,152 --> 00:28:57,196
Hey, I'm Martin Vail.

317
00:28:57,404 --> 00:29:01,950
I'm defending Aaron Stampler.
I need to inspect the murder site.

318
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,411
Oh, the Butcher Boy, huh?

319
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,915
Thank you, yes. I forgot his real name.

320
00:29:13,462 --> 00:29:16,381
What's the matter, Marty?
Lost your faith?

321
00:29:17,341 --> 00:29:18,759
Looking for a little religion?

322
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:23,055
Tell me, counsellor. Which one of us
is the true headline chaser here?

323
00:29:23,263 --> 00:29:27,267
- Unlike you, I was assigned.
- Yeah? And you're up to it?

324
00:29:27,476 --> 00:29:31,605
Sold the book rights, or will you wait?
Wanna see some pictures?

325
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,944
They're kind of cute.

326
00:29:42,032 --> 00:29:46,620
I think you'll agree they clearly show
the heinous nature of the crime.

327
00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:54,419
Small piece of advice. Don't use
the word "heinous" in the courtroom.

328
00:29:54,628 --> 00:29:56,630
Half the jury won't know
what you mean.

329
00:29:56,839 --> 00:30:00,676
Small piece of advice. I'm not
sitting second chair to you any more.

330
00:30:00,884 --> 00:30:04,346
In case you hadn't noticed,
I graduated.

331
00:30:07,516 --> 00:30:11,103
- I had no reason to leave.
- You had every reason to leave.

332
00:30:11,311 --> 00:30:15,941
- How can you still work for them?
- You expect me to trot out after you?

333
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:18,485
Quit just because you did?

334
00:30:18,694 --> 00:30:23,907
I don't need a Mercedes. I don't need
to see my face on the evening news.

335
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:32,541
You knew I was coming here,
didn't you?

336
00:30:32,749 --> 00:30:36,336
You knew I would defend him.
That's why you took the case.

337
00:30:36,545 --> 00:30:42,217
Oh, please. What's the matter, Marty?
Are you nervous?

338
00:30:43,886 --> 00:30:47,973
Been a while since you rubbed up
against a woman with a brain?

339
00:30:50,225 --> 00:30:53,270
What's the matter? You tired,
you haven't been sleeping well?

340
00:30:53,478 --> 00:30:57,107
You're the one with the score to settle.
I sleep great at night.

341
00:31:56,291 --> 00:31:58,502
Cook County Dept. of Corrections
Div. IX Maximum Security Dormitory

342
00:32:05,092 --> 00:32:06,426
Thanks.

343
00:32:08,011 --> 00:32:12,391
- Hey. Where is he?
- Over here.

344
00:32:30,993 --> 00:32:33,996
We'll be sitting at a table
with two of my associates.

345
00:32:34,204 --> 00:32:37,499
Once the charges are read,
the judge'll ask how you plead.

346
00:32:37,708 --> 00:32:40,169
- Not guilty.
- No.

347
00:32:40,377 --> 00:32:42,087
But I'm not guilty, Mr Vail.

348
00:32:42,296 --> 00:32:45,507
It doesn't matter.
Keep your mouth shut.

349
00:32:45,716 --> 00:32:49,553
- Are you gonna say I'm not guilty?
- I'll say whatever I say. Don't worry.

350
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:51,388
- But...
- This is what I mean.

351
00:32:51,597 --> 00:32:57,436
This can't go on in the courtroom. Get
used to it. I speak, you do not speak.

352
00:32:57,644 --> 00:33:01,273
- Your job is to sit and look innocent.
- I am innocent.

353
00:33:02,482 --> 00:33:05,819
That's it! That's how I want you to look.

354
00:33:06,028 --> 00:33:08,530
Can you remember that?
Look in the mirror if you have to.

355
00:33:08,739 --> 00:33:11,825
I don't have to.
This is how I always look.

356
00:33:12,034 --> 00:33:15,746
Then you're way ahead
of the game already, aren't you?

357
00:33:15,954 --> 00:33:17,497
Don't smile.

358
00:33:19,958 --> 00:33:21,752
Don't.

359
00:33:30,135 --> 00:33:35,307
- Mr Vail, can we have a statement?
- We're gonna find out what happened.

360
00:33:35,516 --> 00:33:37,601
The only pressure is to find the truth.

361
00:33:38,644 --> 00:33:42,397
You've talked to the police. I told you
not to. They get everýthing wrong.

362
00:33:42,606 --> 00:33:45,817
How will you explain
his blood-soaked clothes?

363
00:33:46,026 --> 00:33:49,696
I won't explain anything now.
I've just been retained in this case.

364
00:33:49,905 --> 00:33:53,534
Significant facts are in dispute here
and continue to be so.

365
00:33:53,742 --> 00:33:57,621
You're a master at putting the victim
on trial to help your client.

366
00:33:57,829 --> 00:33:59,873
That'll be very difficult in this case.

367
00:34:00,082 --> 00:34:02,584
The victim in this case is my client.

368
00:34:02,793 --> 00:34:05,796
We have two victims here,
no suspects. Thank you.

369
00:34:06,004 --> 00:34:08,507
- You worried about his safety?
- No. Thank you.

370
00:34:24,106 --> 00:34:26,900
I don't think there's any question
about the verdict.

371
00:34:33,448 --> 00:34:35,826
All rise.

372
00:34:36,034 --> 00:34:37,661
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

373
00:34:39,288 --> 00:34:40,622
Bailiff.

374
00:34:40,831 --> 00:34:43,125
The State versus Aaron Stampler.

375
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:47,921
- Is every... Sit down. Everyone here?
- Yes, Your Honour.

376
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:49,840
Madame Prosecutor.

377
00:34:50,048 --> 00:34:54,595
The State charges Aaron Stampler
with murder in the first degree.

378
00:34:54,803 --> 00:34:56,388
How does your client plead?

379
00:34:56,597 --> 00:34:59,016
If it pleases the Court,
I need time to make

380
00:34:59,224 --> 00:35:02,186
a psychiatric evaluation before
charges are brought against us.

381
00:35:02,394 --> 00:35:04,646
The State has enough evidence
to warrant the allegations.

382
00:35:04,855 --> 00:35:08,400
I agree. Motion denied.
Mr Stampler.

383
00:35:09,818 --> 00:35:13,113
- Do you understand the charges?
- Yes.

384
00:35:13,322 --> 00:35:18,285
I direct my client not to answer that.
His response might incriminate him.

385
00:35:18,493 --> 00:35:21,413
He is taking the Fifth on whether
or not he understands the charges?

386
00:35:21,622 --> 00:35:24,708
Yes. Until we have a complete
psychological evaluation,

387
00:35:24,917 --> 00:35:28,795
he will be taking the Fifth on any
and all questions posed to him.

388
00:35:29,004 --> 00:35:31,673
The State versus Appleby.

389
00:35:31,882 --> 00:35:33,884
For your review on precedent.
Thank you.

390
00:35:51,527 --> 00:35:54,571
No, I can't do that. No.

391
00:35:57,366 --> 00:35:58,992
What do you want?

392
00:35:59,201 --> 00:36:02,996
I'm looking for the room a kid named
Aaron Stampler stayed in.

393
00:36:04,915 --> 00:36:08,001
- Are you the police?
- I'm his uncle.

394
00:37:14,443 --> 00:37:16,528
Well, hey.

395
00:37:24,828 --> 00:37:27,539
- This is Alex's.
- Who's Alex?

396
00:37:27,748 --> 00:37:30,209
He's one of the other altar boys.

397
00:37:30,459 --> 00:37:33,378
An altar boy.
An altar boy was wearing this?

398
00:37:35,214 --> 00:37:37,883
Well, not at mass.

399
00:37:39,176 --> 00:37:43,347
This altar boy attacked a colleague
of mine and hurt him pretty bad.

400
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:51,104
What do you think he was doing
in your room?

401
00:37:53,899 --> 00:37:59,404
I can't... I don't know.
I don't have nothing.

402
00:37:59,613 --> 00:38:04,201
- You know where to find him?
- Who? Alex?

403
00:38:04,451 --> 00:38:08,205
- No, I don't know where he is.
- You don't?

404
00:38:08,872 --> 00:38:11,500
- Who's Linda?
- L-Linda?

405
00:38:22,761 --> 00:38:25,848
Is she your girlfriend?

406
00:38:26,098 --> 00:38:28,433
Where is she? I'd like to talk to her.

407
00:38:28,684 --> 00:38:30,644
I don't know where she is.

408
00:38:30,894 --> 00:38:33,397
I get this feeling
you're not telling me something.

409
00:38:33,647 --> 00:38:35,983
- I'm telling you the truth.
- I don't think so.

410
00:38:36,608 --> 00:38:40,696
Are you surprised
that Alex attacked my friend?

411
00:38:40,946 --> 00:38:43,866
No. No, he has a temper.

412
00:38:44,116 --> 00:38:46,410
Yeah, I'd say so.

413
00:38:47,744 --> 00:38:50,747
Do you think it could be Alex

414
00:38:50,956 --> 00:38:55,085
who was that figure you saw
at the Archbishop's room?

415
00:38:55,335 --> 00:38:58,714
I... Alex? I couldn't be sure.

416
00:38:58,964 --> 00:39:01,800
- But it could be him.
- I don't know.

417
00:39:02,009 --> 00:39:04,428
You don't understand.
The State wants you dead.

418
00:39:04,678 --> 00:39:06,763
You don't help me,
that's what they'll get.

419
00:39:11,101 --> 00:39:14,188
I'm trying. I can't remember.

420
00:39:14,438 --> 00:39:17,733
I don't understand. Why would Alex
wanna do such a thing?

421
00:39:17,983 --> 00:39:20,986
For his own reasons.
Maybe someone hired him.

422
00:39:22,988 --> 00:39:26,158
- Hired by who?
- Forget it.

423
00:39:28,994 --> 00:39:31,663
Do you think he's capable of doing it?

424
00:39:32,247 --> 00:39:34,541
I don't know.

425
00:39:36,001 --> 00:39:38,670
I don't know who's capable
of such a thing.

426
00:39:45,344 --> 00:39:46,929
- Oh, thanks.
- Sure.

427
00:39:48,388 --> 00:39:52,601
He claims there was someone else
in the room, and he can't remember.

428
00:39:54,144 --> 00:39:58,982
You want me to look into this amnesia
question and see what he knows?

429
00:39:59,233 --> 00:40:01,902
What if he knows he did it?

430
00:40:02,152 --> 00:40:03,987
Major causes of amnesia are:

431
00:40:04,238 --> 00:40:08,951
substance abuse, seizures,
head injuries and malingering.

432
00:40:11,328 --> 00:40:13,997
I think the kid is telling the truth.

433
00:40:15,749 --> 00:40:19,795
OK. Then let's get something straight.

434
00:40:20,045 --> 00:40:24,842
I'm happy to go in and analyse him,
in fact I'm looking forward to it,

435
00:40:25,092 --> 00:40:28,345
but I won't go in there
to validate a story. Understood?

436
00:40:28,554 --> 00:40:32,057
You do your job,
I do mine, yatta, yatta.

437
00:40:32,307 --> 00:40:34,101
If I think it's necessary,

438
00:40:34,351 --> 00:40:37,646
I'd wanna get an MRl, EEG
and Neuropsych testing.

439
00:40:37,896 --> 00:40:41,525
- Yes, doctor. Good night.
- Good night.

440
00:40:46,989 --> 00:40:49,157
I'll be recording our meetings
for Mr Vail.

441
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:55,247
So it isn't as confidential as it would be
if you were consulting with the doctor.

442
00:40:55,497 --> 00:40:58,959
He may even call me as a witness.
If you have any questions...

443
00:40:59,209 --> 00:41:03,839
- ...you should raise them to him now.
- No, ma'am. I understand.

444
00:41:04,047 --> 00:41:08,927
Good. So, OK. I think we'll be fine.

445
00:41:09,178 --> 00:41:11,263
- I'll see you later.
- OK.

446
00:41:12,222 --> 00:41:13,515
Bye.

447
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:26,028
Vail told me there's time surrounding
the death you don't remember.

448
00:41:26,278 --> 00:41:28,238
- Is that right?
- Yes.

449
00:41:28,447 --> 00:41:31,992
I lost the time.

450
00:41:32,242 --> 00:41:34,995
I mean I blacked out.

451
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:39,666
- Have you had blackouts before?
- Yes, I have.

452
00:41:39,917 --> 00:41:43,629
When's the first time
you remember them happening?

453
00:41:45,881 --> 00:41:49,927
They started when I was about twelve.

454
00:41:50,177 --> 00:41:52,471
Were your parents aware
of what was happening to you?

455
00:41:52,721 --> 00:41:57,643
N-no. My m-m-mother was dead.

456
00:41:59,061 --> 00:42:01,188
And your father?

457
00:42:03,398 --> 00:42:08,195
No, no. He was not a nice man.

458
00:42:08,403 --> 00:42:11,323
- Did you seek treatment?
- Did I what?

459
00:42:12,574 --> 00:42:15,577
- Did you see a doctor for them?
- Oh.

460
00:42:17,371 --> 00:42:19,164
No.

461
00:42:19,414 --> 00:42:23,710
You don't go to a doctor in Creekside
unless your leg's broken.

462
00:42:32,177 --> 00:42:35,764
- Hey. Can I talk to you?
- Talk.

463
00:42:36,014 --> 00:42:38,767
Excuse us. I'll bring her right back.

464
00:42:39,351 --> 00:42:40,978
How dare you?

465
00:42:41,228 --> 00:42:44,231
Am I a chess piece you can
move around? I was having lunch.

466
00:42:44,481 --> 00:42:47,734
When are we getting all the discovery?

467
00:42:47,985 --> 00:42:50,362
- What do you want?
- I want to know when.

468
00:42:50,612 --> 00:42:52,823
- I've got motions to file.
- No, you don't.

469
00:42:53,073 --> 00:42:55,826
You're looking to make a deal.

470
00:42:57,286 --> 00:43:01,415
I have no authority to deal from
my client. What's your excuse?

471
00:43:01,665 --> 00:43:05,002
If we needed to make a deal,
I have all the authority I want.

472
00:43:05,252 --> 00:43:10,215
Bullshit! Shaughnessy wants the
whole shot. He's using you to get it.

473
00:43:10,465 --> 00:43:13,218
Deal this down
to murder with no death penalty.

474
00:43:13,468 --> 00:43:16,388
Deal down?
We have a fucking great case.

475
00:43:17,806 --> 00:43:23,395
Great case? Lack of prior record, no
eye witness, no confession, no motive.

476
00:43:23,604 --> 00:43:29,610
Hard evidence. I assume you're not
going with insanity, which is a shame.

477
00:43:29,818 --> 00:43:32,487
My shrinks would have torn him apart.

478
00:43:33,822 --> 00:43:36,575
Your pleading the Fifth
on the charges was brilliant.

479
00:43:36,783 --> 00:43:39,870
It was good, wasn't it? I liked it.

480
00:43:41,205 --> 00:43:45,417
You lose this case, you take the fall,
not Shaughnessy.

481
00:43:46,835 --> 00:43:50,339
- Talk to me.
- We're going to trial, Marty.

482
00:43:52,508 --> 00:43:56,970
All right. All it takes is one.
One juror who doesn't believe he did it.

483
00:43:57,221 --> 00:44:00,140
One juror with a kid
who looks into that face...

484
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:02,935
That face is great. You prepping him
to take the stand?

485
00:44:03,185 --> 00:44:05,938
That stutter is p-p-priceless.

486
00:44:09,024 --> 00:44:10,901
Oh, Marty.

487
00:44:11,151 --> 00:44:13,987
Don't tell me you think he didn't do it.

488
00:44:14,196 --> 00:44:17,199
Has little Aaron Stampler
gotten to you?

489
00:44:17,449 --> 00:44:21,828
We're not just talking about jail here,
but ending someone's life.

490
00:44:22,037 --> 00:44:25,290
If you're wrong and Shaughnessy's
made you do this, can you live with it?

491
00:44:25,541 --> 00:44:27,668
I'll live.

492
00:44:29,837 --> 00:44:31,880
See you in court.

493
00:44:34,591 --> 00:44:37,052
We stipulate
that murder was done here.

494
00:44:37,302 --> 00:44:39,680
So these photos
have no probative value.

495
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:42,766
This is not just murder,
it's mutilation and torture.

496
00:44:43,016 --> 00:44:46,353
The Prosecution wants to show them
to the jury for shock appeal.

497
00:44:46,562 --> 00:44:50,607
Not true. They clearly identify
the heinous nature of the crime,

498
00:44:50,858 --> 00:44:54,736
and they connect the defendant, found
covered in blood, to the crime scene.

499
00:44:54,987 --> 00:44:57,030
- Prejudicial.
- I beg to differ.

500
00:44:57,239 --> 00:45:00,409
Counsel, please!
The photos are in, Mr Vail.

501
00:45:00,659 --> 00:45:03,662
Would you like a recess
to carry on with this in private?

502
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:05,747
I'm sorry, Your Honour,
but this is too much.

503
00:45:05,998 --> 00:45:08,834
Next thing, he'll be objecting
if we bring in the murder weapon.

504
00:45:12,212 --> 00:45:15,465
Now that she brings it up...

505
00:45:19,469 --> 00:45:21,930
This is a public building.

506
00:45:27,853 --> 00:45:30,147
Excuse me, Mr Vail.

507
00:45:31,565 --> 00:45:34,568
Would you sign this for me?

508
00:45:36,945 --> 00:45:39,698
Tell me about Linda.
Mr Vail said she was your girlfriend.

509
00:45:41,575 --> 00:45:43,118
Yes, she was.

510
00:45:43,368 --> 00:45:45,662
How did you meet?

511
00:45:45,913 --> 00:45:49,166
Well, we were both
at the Savior House.

512
00:45:49,374 --> 00:45:54,254
I was an altar boy. She was doing
work for Bishop Rushman.

513
00:45:55,547 --> 00:46:00,177
- What was the relationship like?
- Me and Linda?

514
00:46:00,385 --> 00:46:04,139
She is real cultural,
real cultural and very smart.

515
00:46:04,348 --> 00:46:06,308
We had a nice time together.

516
00:46:10,312 --> 00:46:11,897
We might get married.

517
00:46:14,441 --> 00:46:16,735
Were you sleeping together?

518
00:46:20,614 --> 00:46:24,034
- Well, that's private.
- I know. I have to ask the question.

519
00:46:24,952 --> 00:46:27,704
Were you having
a sexual relationship, Aaron?

520
00:46:30,415 --> 00:46:32,709
Yes, we were.

521
00:46:32,918 --> 00:46:35,212
Were you sleeping with anyone else
at the time?

522
00:46:36,547 --> 00:46:38,423
No.

523
00:46:38,674 --> 00:46:40,884
Was she?

524
00:46:48,851 --> 00:46:51,645
Has she been to see you, Aaron?

525
00:46:59,027 --> 00:47:02,781
- Well, no, but...
- And that upsets you.

526
00:47:05,826 --> 00:47:09,746
No. No, the thing is she went away.

527
00:47:10,831 --> 00:47:13,375
She went away for a while.

528
00:47:13,584 --> 00:47:17,880
She left before this happened.
I don't even think...

529
00:47:18,088 --> 00:47:20,132
I don't even think she knows about it.

530
00:47:33,687 --> 00:47:35,731
- Yo, boss.
- Hey. Got something for me?

531
00:47:35,981 --> 00:47:37,774
Yeah.

532
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:41,987
There's nothing catalogued downtown
under the numbers B 321 56.

533
00:47:42,196 --> 00:47:48,619
But I don't think the B is a B. It's an 8.
I think the knife slipped. 8321 56.

534
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:52,164
Thomas Jefferson.
I don't think he did it.

535
00:47:52,414 --> 00:47:58,045
This won't help. Rushman's charities
and his foundation's investments.

536
00:47:58,253 --> 00:48:00,631
Nothing startling,
except how many there are.

537
00:48:03,967 --> 00:48:05,844
Wait a minute here.

538
00:48:06,094 --> 00:48:09,264
What was he doing
with the South River deal? Pull that up.

539
00:48:10,891 --> 00:48:12,392
LOADING FILE

540
00:48:13,185 --> 00:48:15,020
Yeah. The investors.

541
00:48:17,606 --> 00:48:19,983
Shaughnessy?

542
00:48:20,192 --> 00:48:22,569
That's Joey Pinero's neighbourhood.

543
00:48:23,111 --> 00:48:26,365
See this lot here?
This all used to be houses.

544
00:48:26,573 --> 00:48:32,746
In fact, there was a house in the corner
where I kissed my first girlfriend.

545
00:48:32,955 --> 00:48:34,831
Got her pregnant, too.

546
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,334
- Hell of a kiss, Joey.
- Oh, yeah.

547
00:48:37,584 --> 00:48:42,130
The neighbourhood will end up
high-rent condos if they get their way.

548
00:48:42,339 --> 00:48:45,133
That's why I'll buy back the lot
with the settlement you got me.

549
00:48:45,843 --> 00:48:47,928
You heard about the money, right?

550
00:48:48,136 --> 00:48:50,097
- Who hasn't?
- Marty's the best, man.

551
00:48:50,347 --> 00:48:52,391
Just doing my job.

552
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:54,810
1 ,500,000. He's just doing his job.

553
00:48:55,018 --> 00:48:59,815
Alderman, Joey tells me a cop came
around, wanting him to set you up.

554
00:49:02,067 --> 00:49:04,111
It's typical.

555
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:07,531
Can't buy me,
so they try to buy a brother.

556
00:49:07,739 --> 00:49:11,660
Most people assume this land we're
walking on belongs to the railroad.

557
00:49:11,869 --> 00:49:15,455
But it doesn't. It belongs to the Church.

558
00:49:15,664 --> 00:49:17,249
The Church?

559
00:49:19,543 --> 00:49:21,920
- So that's the Rushman Foundation.
- That's right.

560
00:49:22,171 --> 00:49:27,843
- With a bunch of rich developers.
- Including John Shaughnessy.

561
00:49:28,051 --> 00:49:33,891
They bought up land and buildings
around the Church property

562
00:49:34,099 --> 00:49:38,020
and tore them down.
Our neighbourhood would disappear.

563
00:49:38,228 --> 00:49:42,399
I went to the Archbishop and said,
"What are you doing to these people?"

564
00:49:42,608 --> 00:49:46,778
"They're poor. They're getting
kicked out of their homes."

565
00:49:46,987 --> 00:49:49,615
- "And they're Catholic."
- Fucking A.

566
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:53,744
He listened. I couldn't believe it.

567
00:49:53,994 --> 00:49:56,288
He told them to stop developing
around the Church property.

568
00:49:56,538 --> 00:50:01,752
The partners hold buildings they can't
demolish and land they can't build on.

569
00:50:02,002 --> 00:50:04,922
Shaughnessy loses millions.

570
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:07,925
- If I need you to, will you testify?
- Who? Me?

571
00:50:08,133 --> 00:50:10,511
Oh, yeah. Easy.

572
00:50:10,761 --> 00:50:13,931
Just change out of this suit, put on
a Brooks Brothers with loafers and...

573
00:50:14,139 --> 00:50:16,808
No, Joey. Not you.

574
00:50:18,852 --> 00:50:21,104
Sure.

575
00:50:21,313 --> 00:50:23,357
I'll testify.

576
00:50:25,943 --> 00:50:29,696
You know what people think?
That this great city runs itself.

577
00:50:29,905 --> 00:50:34,576
They think it gets up, goes to work and
climbs into bed at night, like we do.

578
00:50:34,785 --> 00:50:37,955
Unaware of what it takes to make sure
it doesn't break down.

579
00:50:38,163 --> 00:50:41,667
Crime, fires, riots.

580
00:50:41,917 --> 00:50:46,713
The water pipes bursting under
the city. What a mess that was.

581
00:50:46,964 --> 00:50:50,008
And the Water Commissioner
calls the contractor who built it?

582
00:50:50,217 --> 00:50:53,554
No, he calls me. They all call me.

583
00:50:56,598 --> 00:50:58,642
Goddamn, this is terrific.

584
00:50:59,601 --> 00:51:04,815
They call me because I keep
the peace. That's my job.

585
00:51:06,483 --> 00:51:09,361
This city doesn't burn
because I won't permit it.

586
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:11,446
I'm the great negotiator.

587
00:51:11,655 --> 00:51:14,992
You think people get that?
The truth is I don't care.

588
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,661
The dumb bastards don't even vote.

589
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:21,373
They just eat, sleep, watch TV
and occasionally fuck their wives.

590
00:51:22,958 --> 00:51:25,711
Guess we should all thank you.

591
00:51:25,919 --> 00:51:27,588
You're welcome.

592
00:51:28,797 --> 00:51:31,258
John, you need some new material.

593
00:51:31,466 --> 00:51:35,679
I've heard this great-city speech
ten times already.

594
00:51:37,848 --> 00:51:40,392
Your boy Pinero is not honouring
his side of the deal.

595
00:51:41,727 --> 00:51:45,647
- Is that what this dinner is about?
- In part.

596
00:51:45,898 --> 00:51:50,485
I told him what the deal is.
He's a grown up. What else?

597
00:51:52,112 --> 00:51:55,699
Your assistant's been digging around
in the Archbishop's finances.

598
00:51:57,409 --> 00:51:59,620
Yeah, well.

599
00:52:06,126 --> 00:52:11,548
How much did you lose when he
pulled the plug from South River?

600
00:52:11,757 --> 00:52:14,051
Let me tell you something.

601
00:52:14,259 --> 00:52:18,013
It's a mistake to stick your thumb in
the eyes of the city's most powerful.

602
00:52:18,222 --> 00:52:21,433
It's not their eyes I'm aiming for.

603
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,563
Do not fuck with me, Marty.

604
00:52:41,036 --> 00:52:43,830
The pipes are bursting again, John.

605
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:04,017
In the most anticipated murder trial
in recent Chicago history,

606
00:53:04,226 --> 00:53:08,272
former State Attorney Prosecutor
Martin Vail will lead...

607
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:17,364
Richard Rushman was a man of God.

608
00:53:17,614 --> 00:53:21,201
He spent his life giving
to the people of Chicago.

609
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:25,455
He was a beacon ofinspiration,
not only as a spiritual leader...

610
00:53:25,664 --> 00:53:28,625
...deliver his opening statement
tomorrow...

611
00:53:28,834 --> 00:53:33,505
My name is Martin Vail. The reason
I'm here, and the reason you're here,

612
00:53:33,714 --> 00:53:36,967
is to make sure
the whole truth is known.

613
00:53:37,176 --> 00:53:38,844
We can learn the truth

614
00:53:39,052 --> 00:53:41,889
by talking about what the Prosecution
does not want you to hear.

615
00:53:42,097 --> 00:53:46,476
Do not be fooled by the defendant's
innocent appearance and demeanour.

616
00:53:46,685 --> 00:53:50,772
Aaron Stampler sat injudgment
ofArchbishop Rushman

617
00:53:50,981 --> 00:53:53,650
and determined
that not only should he die,

618
00:53:53,859 --> 00:53:56,111
but he should die the most brutal...

619
00:53:56,320 --> 00:54:00,657
We all saw Aaron being arrested
minutes after the Archbishop's death.

620
00:54:00,866 --> 00:54:06,788
But why? Because he was convenient
and the police were under pressure...

621
00:54:06,997 --> 00:54:11,752
The evidence will show that Aaron
Stampler stalked, ambushed

622
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:14,129
and savagely murdered
this great man.

623
00:54:14,338 --> 00:54:16,215
The Prosecution doesn't want you
to hear about

624
00:54:16,423 --> 00:54:19,927
the other altar boys who have
mysteriously disappeared.

625
00:54:20,135 --> 00:54:22,471
At the close of evidence,
you will learn

626
00:54:22,679 --> 00:54:24,765
that Aaron Stampler
had everything he needed

627
00:54:24,973 --> 00:54:27,643
for the perfect assassination.
Using this knife...

628
00:54:29,186 --> 00:54:34,441
..Aaron Stampler repeatedly stabbed
at the Archbishop's chest,

629
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:37,194
his genitals and his eyes.

630
00:54:37,402 --> 00:54:39,696
They don't want you to hear
that the Archbishop

631
00:54:39,905 --> 00:54:42,533
invested on behalf
of the Roman Catholic Church.

632
00:54:42,741 --> 00:54:47,454
Investments resulting in huge losses
for some very powerful people.

633
00:54:48,163 --> 00:54:53,919
They don't want you to hear about the
20 death threats he received this year.

634
00:54:54,127 --> 00:54:58,632
And they really don't want you
to hear about their theory of motive.

635
00:54:58,841 --> 00:55:00,425
Why is that? Very simple.

636
00:55:03,178 --> 00:55:05,180
They don't have one.

637
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:12,813
Inspector Woodside, explain to the
court where the sneakers came from.

638
00:55:13,021 --> 00:55:16,316
They were taken off the defendant
when he was apprehended.

639
00:55:16,525 --> 00:55:19,528
What was the result
of the blood-stain analysis?

640
00:55:19,736 --> 00:55:22,239
They proved to be human blood

641
00:55:22,447 --> 00:55:26,034
matching the blood type and DNA
characteristics of the Archbishop.

642
00:55:26,243 --> 00:55:28,954
What did the bloody footprints
surrounding the body tell you?

643
00:55:29,162 --> 00:55:33,917
The killer left a pattern of footprints
around the area of the struggle,

644
00:55:34,126 --> 00:55:37,129
as indicated by the spread of blood
through the room.

645
00:55:37,337 --> 00:55:42,134
Yes or no, inspector. Could there have
been a third person in the quarters?

646
00:55:42,342 --> 00:55:45,888
- There's no evidence to suggest that.
- No evidence proves there wasn't.

647
00:55:46,096 --> 00:55:47,598
No.

648
00:55:47,806 --> 00:55:49,641
What happened after the struggle?

649
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:53,437
Our analysis suggests
the killer was startled and ran

650
00:55:53,645 --> 00:55:55,439
from the bedroom and down the stairs.

651
00:55:55,647 --> 00:56:01,612
Is it possible, inspector...
that the real killer, the third person,

652
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:06,325
who maybe was smart enough not
to tramp a whole freeway of blood

653
00:56:06,533 --> 00:56:08,202
through the whole place,

654
00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:12,122
couldn't this third person have placed
the defendant's prints on the knife...

655
00:56:12,331 --> 00:56:15,876
- ...while he was passed out?
- Anything is possible.

656
00:56:16,084 --> 00:56:19,546
Clearly the victim suffered
a great number of stab wounds.

657
00:56:19,755 --> 00:56:21,423
Yes, he did. 78.

658
00:56:21,632 --> 00:56:25,969
He tried to defend himself, that
explains cuts on hands and forearms.

659
00:56:26,178 --> 00:56:28,972
Doctor, isn't it a fact
that you can't be sure

660
00:56:29,181 --> 00:56:34,770
whether more than one person inflicted
these 78 stab and incised wounds?

661
00:56:34,978 --> 00:56:37,856
It could have been more than one,
but I doubt it.

662
00:56:38,065 --> 00:56:40,692
From your analysis
of the knife wounds,

663
00:56:40,901 --> 00:56:44,112
do you have an opinion whether
the killer was left or right-handed?

664
00:56:44,321 --> 00:56:46,907
The wounds to the throat
and most of the chest wounds

665
00:56:47,115 --> 00:56:51,495
were made from an angle that strongly
suggests a left-handed person.

666
00:56:51,703 --> 00:56:54,873
- Is the defendant left-handed?
- Yes, he is.

667
00:56:55,082 --> 00:57:01,046
It's possible a right-handed person
could have used his left hand.

668
00:57:01,255 --> 00:57:02,714
Yes, I suppose that's possible.

669
00:57:02,923 --> 00:57:08,470
Then it's reasonable to assume there
was a third person at the crime scene.

670
00:57:08,679 --> 00:57:11,723
Reasonable, no. But it is possible.

671
00:57:11,932 --> 00:57:15,477
...then following opening statements
it was a day ofstrong testimony

672
00:57:15,686 --> 00:57:17,604
from the Prosecution's first witnesses,

673
00:57:17,813 --> 00:57:22,484
Forensics ChiefHarvey Woodside
and Medical Examiner Emile Weil.

674
00:57:22,693 --> 00:57:25,696
It was also tough cross-examination
of Woodside and Weil

675
00:57:25,904 --> 00:57:28,407
by Stampler defence attorney
Martin Vail.

676
00:57:30,617 --> 00:57:33,829
Captain Stenner, thank you
for the time you've given us.

677
00:57:33,996 --> 00:57:39,626
But finally, I'd like to turn your attention
to the symbol carved into the chest.

678
00:57:39,835 --> 00:57:43,172
Would you please tell the jury
about that, captain?

679
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:46,300
Yes, the letter and the numbers

680
00:57:46,508 --> 00:57:50,596
B 32.1 56 were carved
into the Archbishop's chest.

681
00:57:50,804 --> 00:57:54,975
Have you been able to find
an identical reference anywhere?

682
00:57:55,184 --> 00:57:56,727
I believe so, yes.

683
00:57:56,935 --> 00:58:02,816
The symbol B 32.1 56 is actually
catalogue code for a book

684
00:58:03,025 --> 00:58:06,987
discovered in a private reading room
located in the church basement.

685
00:58:07,196 --> 00:58:12,784
That particular number, the B 32 part,
refers to a book, The Scarlet Letter,

686
00:58:12,993 --> 00:58:14,828
by Nathaniel Hawthorne.

687
00:58:15,037 --> 00:58:18,665
When we opened the book
to page 1 56,

688
00:58:18,874 --> 00:58:21,502
we discovered an underlined passage.

689
00:58:22,878 --> 00:58:27,174
Could you please read
this underlined passage to the court?

690
00:58:29,301 --> 00:58:32,137
"No man, for any considerable period,"

691
00:58:32,346 --> 00:58:35,807
"can wear one face to himself
and another to the multitude"

692
00:58:36,016 --> 00:58:41,188
"without finally getting bewildered
as to which may be the true."

693
00:58:41,396 --> 00:58:43,774
Thank you.

694
00:58:46,985 --> 00:58:48,820
What does that passage mean to you?

695
00:58:49,029 --> 00:58:51,657
Objection. He's a policeman,
not an English professor.

696
00:58:51,865 --> 00:58:54,618
His interpretation will be
speculative and irrelevant.

697
00:58:54,826 --> 00:58:58,372
She didn't ask for an expert opinion.
Witness can answer.

698
00:58:59,873 --> 00:59:01,792
Well, to me it's simple.

699
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,463
The killer thought his victim was
two-faced, dishonest in some way.

700
00:59:06,672 --> 00:59:08,340
In your experience, captain,

701
00:59:08,549 --> 00:59:12,052
do killers ever intentionally
leave clues to their motive?

702
00:59:12,261 --> 00:59:15,597
Not often, but it happens.

703
00:59:20,978 --> 00:59:22,604
Thanks.

704
00:59:22,813 --> 00:59:24,356
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah, sure.

705
00:59:25,482 --> 00:59:27,860
Did you underline that book?

706
00:59:28,068 --> 00:59:30,571
- What?
- Did you underline that book?

707
00:59:30,779 --> 00:59:33,156
- No, Mr Vail.
- No?

708
00:59:33,365 --> 00:59:37,494
No, Mr Vail. I never even opened
The Scarlet Letter.

709
00:59:37,703 --> 00:59:40,581
I don't like Hawthorne.

710
00:59:40,789 --> 00:59:43,584
We had that one about the house with
the seven somethings in high school,

711
00:59:43,792 --> 00:59:47,004
I couldn't even get past page 1 0.

712
00:59:48,172 --> 00:59:52,384
I wasn't the only one
using Bishop Rushman's library.

713
00:59:52,593 --> 00:59:54,845
Everybody borrowed books
from Bishop Rushman.

714
00:59:55,053 --> 00:59:58,390
He encouraged it. Altar boys, staff,
everyone was in there.

715
00:59:58,599 --> 01:00:00,392
Guard.

716
01:00:10,402 --> 01:00:12,821
You don't give up, do you?

717
01:00:17,034 --> 01:00:20,913
- You didn't know anything about that?
- No.

718
01:00:21,121 --> 01:00:23,874
- What about the impact...?
- I can't talk right now.

719
01:00:24,082 --> 01:00:26,543
My office will call you, right? OK, bye.

720
01:00:26,752 --> 01:00:28,170
- Thanks.
- See you.

721
01:00:30,631 --> 01:00:32,174
Bye.

722
01:00:38,305 --> 01:00:40,766
What the fuck happened in there?

723
01:00:40,974 --> 01:00:43,769
I guess that 8 was a B after all.

724
01:00:45,354 --> 01:00:49,816
You think this is funny?
We're losing this case.

725
01:00:50,025 --> 01:00:51,818
What happened?
How could you've missed that?

726
01:00:52,027 --> 01:00:54,821
There are 50 of them,
plus the entire Chicago PD.

727
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:57,533
How was I to know he had
a reading room in the basement?

728
01:00:57,741 --> 01:00:59,159
- It's your job.
- You want my job?!

729
01:00:59,368 --> 01:01:02,287
- No, I want you to do your job!
- Marty, come on.

730
01:01:03,914 --> 01:01:06,834
I'm working on a third-man defence.
Figured that out yet?

731
01:01:07,042 --> 01:01:12,047
I don't have a third man. Why?
Because you can't fucking find him!

732
01:01:12,256 --> 01:01:17,135
- Is it that hard to find one indigent kid?
- Maybe we already got the kid.

733
01:01:17,344 --> 01:01:20,848
We have to at least consider
the possibility that he did it.

734
01:01:21,056 --> 01:01:23,976
The evidence points towards him,
and you refuse to look at it.

735
01:01:24,184 --> 01:01:27,563
I'm not refusing to look at anything!
I don't think he did it!

736
01:01:28,647 --> 01:01:31,775
We're up there in a couple of days,
and we got dick!

737
01:01:31,984 --> 01:01:34,778
- Do your fucking jobs!
- Fuck!

738
01:01:49,585 --> 01:01:53,422
It must have been hard to come
to Chicago. You didn't know anybody.

739
01:01:55,048 --> 01:01:56,383
Nobody.

740
01:01:57,634 --> 01:01:59,720
Did you have any money?

741
01:01:59,928 --> 01:02:02,723
No, nothing.

742
01:02:03,974 --> 01:02:08,520
I wanna talk more about
your girlfriend, Linda. Can we, Aaron?

743
01:02:10,355 --> 01:02:12,357
- No.
- Why not?

744
01:02:16,987 --> 01:02:18,614
Aaron.

745
01:02:23,827 --> 01:02:26,455
Oh, I'm sorry.

746
01:02:28,665 --> 01:02:31,752
D-d-do you think
we can do this later?

747
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:37,591
- No, I wanna stay with this a while.
- I'm just a li-li-little tired.

748
01:02:37,799 --> 01:02:41,178
I know. Why does talking about
Linda Forbes upset you?

749
01:02:41,386 --> 01:02:44,890
It d-d... It doesn't.

750
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:49,436
I just don't want
to talk about it right now.

751
01:02:49,645 --> 01:02:55,150
- Why not? Are you all right?
- No, my head hurts.

752
01:02:56,693 --> 01:02:58,695
OK, I'm sorry. Let me just fix this.

753
01:03:04,368 --> 01:03:08,121
- You know what I can do with this?
- No, how the fuck should I know?

754
01:03:11,834 --> 01:03:13,752
Jesus Christ.

755
01:03:22,678 --> 01:03:24,346
Aaron?

756
01:03:33,522 --> 01:03:37,234
What? What were you saying?

757
01:06:30,782 --> 01:06:33,744
What do you want? I'll kill you!

758
01:06:33,952 --> 01:06:36,330
I don't think so, Alex. Drop it.

759
01:06:36,997 --> 01:06:38,540
Drop it.

760
01:06:43,045 --> 01:06:46,048
- Remember me, huh?!
- My name is Martin Vail.

761
01:06:46,256 --> 01:06:48,425
I don't give a fuck!
You have no right!

762
01:06:48,634 --> 01:06:53,096
Every fucking right! I'm Aaron
Stampler's attorney, you little shit!

763
01:06:53,305 --> 01:06:56,767
Now! What do you know
about the Archbishop's murder?

764
01:06:59,394 --> 01:07:02,356
- Nothing.
- Where do you think you're going?

765
01:07:02,564 --> 01:07:05,692
Bullshit! Don't fuck with us.

766
01:07:05,901 --> 01:07:08,654
I swear I know nothing.

767
01:07:08,862 --> 01:07:11,448
What were you doing at Aaron's
house? What were you looking for?

768
01:07:13,784 --> 01:07:16,620
- A tape.
- A tape? A videotape?

769
01:07:16,828 --> 01:07:18,872
- Yeah.
- Of what?

770
01:07:23,126 --> 01:07:26,713
- Sex stuff.
- Sex stuff?

771
01:07:26,922 --> 01:07:29,925
Do I have to draw a picture for you?

772
01:07:30,133 --> 01:07:31,510
Who?

773
01:07:31,718 --> 01:07:33,804
Who?!

774
01:07:34,012 --> 01:07:35,889
Me, Linda.

775
01:07:39,059 --> 01:07:43,021
- And Aaron?
- He shot it, too, for the Archbishop.

776
01:07:44,106 --> 01:07:45,440
Are you telling...

777
01:07:45,649 --> 01:07:50,779
Are you telling me that Archbishop
Rushman is involved with sex stuff?

778
01:07:50,988 --> 01:07:53,740
Yeah, he called it "purging the devil".

779
01:07:53,949 --> 01:07:57,202
He'd say a sermon for ten minutes,
and then he would tell us what to do.

780
01:07:57,411 --> 01:07:59,580
I don't give a fuck what you believe!

781
01:08:00,038 --> 01:08:04,459
Hey, hey, hey. What were you
going to do with the tape?

782
01:08:04,668 --> 01:08:07,880
Trash it. I was gonna throw it away.

783
01:08:08,088 --> 01:08:09,798
One. Just one tape.

784
01:08:10,007 --> 01:08:12,467
One tape.
He'd keep recording over and over.

785
01:08:12,676 --> 01:08:14,803
- Why did you think Aaron had this?
- I don't know.

786
01:08:15,012 --> 01:08:18,098
I thought he got it,
and he went back and killed him.

787
01:08:18,307 --> 01:08:21,560
- He did kill him, right?
- No, he didn't.

788
01:08:23,937 --> 01:08:25,689
Where's this girl? Where's Linda?

789
01:08:32,070 --> 01:08:35,115
She freaked out!
She panicked. She split.

790
01:08:35,324 --> 01:08:37,784
And I'm not expecting any postcards.

791
01:08:43,415 --> 01:08:45,459
Look at me.

792
01:08:56,386 --> 01:09:00,057
Get him out of here, Tommy.

793
01:09:00,265 --> 01:09:02,643
- Where to?
- A warm bunk and three meals a day.

794
01:09:02,851 --> 01:09:07,105
- You can't arrest me! You're no cop!
- I used to be. Does that work for you?

795
01:09:35,008 --> 01:09:38,053
- Look who's here.
- Finish it. It's a good article.

796
01:09:38,262 --> 01:09:40,639
You know the rules.
Don't disturb anything,

797
01:09:40,848 --> 01:09:43,225
don't remove anything or it's my ass.

798
01:09:43,433 --> 01:09:46,270
Yeah, mine too. I won't touch anything.

799
01:10:46,163 --> 01:10:47,831
Excuse me.

800
01:10:57,466 --> 01:10:59,551
...preach the gospel to every...

801
01:11:05,265 --> 01:11:07,100
Hello.

802
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:10,521
- What are you watching?
- Wait a minute.

803
01:11:10,729 --> 01:11:12,814
Go to her.

804
01:11:13,023 --> 01:11:16,193
Good. Now help her.

805
01:11:18,695 --> 01:11:21,740
That's it, Aaron. Good.

806
01:11:21,949 --> 01:11:24,576
Linda, help out.

807
01:11:24,785 --> 01:11:27,788
Good. Take offher blouse, Aaron.

808
01:11:29,915 --> 01:11:34,545
That's it. Now help him, Linda.

809
01:11:34,753 --> 01:11:38,215
Isn't that sweet, Linda? Good.

810
01:11:38,423 --> 01:11:41,510
That's it.
Now, take him in your mouth.

811
01:11:41,718 --> 01:11:43,846
Here's motive.

812
01:11:44,763 --> 01:11:46,765
Take her from behind.

813
01:11:46,974 --> 01:11:50,519
- Aaron, take her from behind.
- Jesus Christ.

814
01:11:54,648 --> 01:11:56,275
Thanks.

815
01:12:05,701 --> 01:12:08,495
- I wanna talk to you alone.
- We should discuss...

816
01:12:08,704 --> 01:12:11,331
I need to be alone with my client.

817
01:12:22,968 --> 01:12:25,387
Do you trust me?

818
01:12:27,264 --> 01:12:29,558
Yes, yes, of course I do.

819
01:12:29,766 --> 01:12:32,269
Good. Because I don't trust you.

820
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:40,444
I'll lay it all out for you.

821
01:12:43,113 --> 01:12:47,951
I'm losing this case because
my fucking client is lying to me.

822
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:51,705
- I never, never lied...
- Bullshit!

823
01:12:53,248 --> 01:12:56,001
No more bullshit. No more games.

824
01:12:57,419 --> 01:12:59,213
Everybody thinks you did this,
everybody.

825
01:12:59,421 --> 01:13:01,882
Only I believe you,
and I'm that close.

826
01:13:02,090 --> 01:13:05,969
So I want it all out.
Right now, right here.

827
01:13:07,638 --> 01:13:09,890
Did you underline that book?

828
01:13:10,599 --> 01:13:13,602
Hey, hey, look at me.
Did you underline that book?

829
01:13:13,810 --> 01:13:17,564
- N-n-no, I didn't.
- I don't believe you.

830
01:13:18,148 --> 01:13:20,067
- That's bullshit.
- I told...

831
01:13:20,275 --> 01:13:23,403
I don't believe you! I saw the tape!

832
01:13:24,905 --> 01:13:28,408
I saw the tape. I know what he did
to you. I wanna hear it from you.

833
01:13:28,617 --> 01:13:30,327
No! No!

834
01:13:30,536 --> 01:13:33,455
Don't do this.
I want you to tell me the truth.

835
01:13:33,664 --> 01:13:36,166
- You fucking killed him! You did it!
- No!

836
01:13:36,375 --> 01:13:39,378
You're so full of shit! You did it!
Tell me the truth. Don't lie.

837
01:13:39,586 --> 01:13:41,296
You little fuck! You killed him!

838
01:13:41,505 --> 01:13:44,091
- You son of a bitch! You killed him!
- No!

839
01:13:44,591 --> 01:13:46,260
What do you want from me now?

840
01:13:46,468 --> 01:13:49,805
Quit crying! I can't understand
a word you're saying.

841
01:13:50,013 --> 01:13:51,974
You little sissy! You make me sick!

842
01:13:56,270 --> 01:13:59,106
- Look here. Who the fuck are you?
- Who the fuck are you?

843
01:13:59,314 --> 01:14:02,526
This is my cell! Who the fuck are you?

844
01:14:05,904 --> 01:14:09,533
I got you now. You're the lawyer.

845
01:14:11,076 --> 01:14:14,621
You're a lawyer, ain't you? With
your fancy suit. I heard about you.

846
01:14:15,873 --> 01:14:19,418
My, my, you sure fucked
this one up, counsellor.

847
01:14:19,626 --> 01:14:23,714
Sounds like they're gonna shoot Aaron
so full of poison it'll come out his eyes!

848
01:14:25,299 --> 01:14:27,926
- Where is Aaron?
- He's crying in a corner somewhere.

849
01:14:28,135 --> 01:14:31,263
You scared him off!
You got to deal with me now, boy.

850
01:14:32,139 --> 01:14:34,975
I ought to give you
a beating on principle. Look at me.

851
01:14:35,184 --> 01:14:40,147
You pull that tough-guy shit on Aaron
again, I'll kick your ass to Sunday!

852
01:14:40,355 --> 01:14:43,483
- Do you understand me?
- I understand you.

853
01:14:43,692 --> 01:14:47,237
Aaron gets in trouble, he calls you.
You're the man.

854
01:14:47,446 --> 01:14:49,448
Aaron couldn't kick his own ass.

855
01:14:49,656 --> 01:14:52,492
You seen him with the "da-da-da".

856
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:54,912
Yeah.

857
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:56,997
Jesus Christ, he can't handle anything.

858
01:14:57,206 --> 01:15:00,709
He sure couldn't handle
all that preacher's blood.

859
01:15:00,918 --> 01:15:03,420
If he'd done like I told him,
we wouldn't be in this mess.

860
01:15:03,629 --> 01:15:05,964
But he got scared and "da".

861
01:15:06,173 --> 01:15:09,635
Ran off and got himself caught,
the stupid little shit.

862
01:15:09,843 --> 01:15:12,930
So Aaron did kill Rushman.

863
01:15:13,138 --> 01:15:15,974
Hell no! Jesus Christ,
where did they find you?

864
01:15:16,183 --> 01:15:21,480
Haven't you listened to me?
Aaron doesn't have guts to do nothing.

865
01:15:21,688 --> 01:15:23,315
It was me, boy.

866
01:15:25,150 --> 01:15:27,819
- It was you.
- Yes, it was.

867
01:15:28,862 --> 01:15:32,991
He came crying to me like always,
stuttering and whining.

868
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:37,746
"I ca-can't take it no more, Roy.
You g-got to help me."

869
01:15:37,955 --> 01:15:39,915
"Please, please, Roy."

870
01:15:40,123 --> 01:15:45,420
I said, "Shut your mouth! Grow up.
Be a man. Take care of yourself."

871
01:15:48,882 --> 01:15:51,385
So your name is Roy?

872
01:15:51,593 --> 01:15:55,639
Oh, Jesus, I'm sorry. Yeah.
What is it? Marty?

873
01:15:55,848 --> 01:15:58,016
Marty, I'm dying for a smoke.
Do you have a cigarette?

874
01:15:58,225 --> 01:16:01,186
- No, I quit.
- Fuck that.

875
01:16:02,604 --> 01:16:04,690
Can't live without them.
Got to be a butt here.

876
01:16:04,898 --> 01:16:06,483
Roy.

877
01:16:07,484 --> 01:16:10,946
Roy, tell me about Linda.

878
01:16:12,781 --> 01:16:15,617
Linda?
Who the fuck cares about Linda?

879
01:16:15,826 --> 01:16:18,370
I care about Linda.
I'd like to know about her.

880
01:16:18,579 --> 01:16:22,749
That little tramp. Everybody
had a piece of her, you know.

881
01:16:22,958 --> 01:16:26,837
She had Aaron wrapped up so tight,
he thought she was his girlfriend.

882
01:16:27,045 --> 01:16:28,630
She broke his heart.

883
01:16:28,839 --> 01:16:33,927
So that's why you had to kill Rushman.
Because of the sex stuff.

884
01:16:36,763 --> 01:16:39,141
You've seen the tape.

885
01:16:41,351 --> 01:16:43,145
Answer me, you son of a bitch!

886
01:16:44,104 --> 01:16:49,568
Do you think I'm playing with you?
I will break your fucking neck!

887
01:16:49,776 --> 01:16:53,197
- I'll ask again. Have you seen it?
- Of course I saw the tape.

888
01:16:53,405 --> 01:16:58,035
Dammit, I told him, "Get that tape.
It's motive, you asshole!"

889
01:16:58,243 --> 01:17:01,663
This'll fuck everýthing up.
Don't you show that to anyone!

890
01:17:01,872 --> 01:17:03,832
- Do you understand me?!
- Yeah.

891
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:06,126
- Aaron.
- Damn!

892
01:17:49,545 --> 01:17:51,547
Mist...

893
01:17:51,755 --> 01:17:53,423
Mister Vail?

894
01:17:59,638 --> 01:18:02,641
Yeah, I'm right here, Aaron.

895
01:18:26,540 --> 01:18:30,002
He did it. The little fuck did it.

896
01:18:32,629 --> 01:18:34,548
How could I have missed that?

897
01:18:34,756 --> 01:18:37,718
- Am I gonna need stitches?
- No.

898
01:18:40,387 --> 01:18:44,725
He didn't do it. Aaron has no idea
what just happened in there.

899
01:18:44,933 --> 01:18:46,852
I kept seeing the signs. The big ones.

900
01:18:47,060 --> 01:18:51,231
Abusive background, these repeated
blackouts, the ellipses in thought.

901
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:54,401
He's ambidextrous. I tried to tell you.

902
01:18:54,610 --> 01:19:00,282
You may be thrilled by all this,
but I'm fucked. I don't have a case.

903
01:19:00,490 --> 01:19:05,704
Textbook multiple personality disorder.
Put me on the stand. I'll testify.

904
01:19:05,913 --> 01:19:07,623
He's insane.

905
01:19:08,373 --> 01:19:13,587
I can't. I can't change plea
in the middle of a trial.

906
01:19:14,463 --> 01:19:20,427
The judge would never allow it.
Insanity is the hardest thing to prove.

907
01:19:20,636 --> 01:19:23,055
OK.

908
01:19:23,263 --> 01:19:25,974
My professional opinion.

909
01:19:26,183 --> 01:19:29,311
This is not a criminal
we're dealing with. He's a sick kid.

910
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:32,856
He's sitting in a cell,
and that's not where he belongs.

911
01:19:40,030 --> 01:19:41,740
You got an aspirin?

912
01:20:40,299 --> 01:20:43,260
Come on, Connerman, ask it.

913
01:20:43,468 --> 01:20:45,345
Ask what?

914
01:20:47,097 --> 01:20:50,559
The question
you wanted to ask me before.

915
01:20:50,767 --> 01:20:52,978
I don't understand, Mr Vail.

916
01:20:53,187 --> 01:20:57,524
"How can you defend someone
if you know they did it?"

917
01:20:57,733 --> 01:21:02,362
"How can you defend these
fucking scumbags?" Isn't that it?

918
01:21:02,571 --> 01:21:04,823
All those fucking coy questions,
all that bullshit.

919
01:21:05,032 --> 01:21:08,243
Bottom line is:
"How can you do what you do?"

920
01:21:14,041 --> 01:21:17,211
You think it's the money, don't you?

921
01:21:18,921 --> 01:21:23,592
The money's nice.
The money's very, very nice, Jack.

922
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:27,513
The first thing I ask a new client is:

923
01:21:27,721 --> 01:21:29,806
"You been saving up for a rainy day?"

924
01:21:30,015 --> 01:21:33,894
"Guess what? It's raining."

925
01:21:36,063 --> 01:21:39,066
You think it's because I want to see
my face on magazine covers?

926
01:21:40,776 --> 01:21:46,949
My 1 5 seconds on TV? I love it.
I fucking love that shit. I really do.

927
01:21:47,157 --> 01:21:49,409
But guess what?

928
01:21:49,618 --> 01:21:51,453
It's not it.

929
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:57,835
- You go to Las Vegas?
- Yeah.

930
01:21:58,043 --> 01:22:01,338
I don't go to Vegas.
Why don't I go to Vegas?

931
01:22:01,547 --> 01:22:03,966
Marty, it's late.
I think we should just get up and...

932
01:22:04,174 --> 01:22:08,303
Why gamble with money when you
can gamble with people's lives?

933
01:22:11,431 --> 01:22:13,475
That was a joke.

934
01:22:15,978 --> 01:22:18,939
All right, I'll tell you.

935
01:22:23,443 --> 01:22:28,407
I believe in the notion that people
are innocent until proven guilty.

936
01:22:28,615 --> 01:22:32,244
I believe in that notion
because I choose to believe

937
01:22:32,452 --> 01:22:35,831
in the basic goodness of people.

938
01:22:36,039 --> 01:22:41,003
I choose to believe that not all crimes
are committed by bad people.

939
01:22:41,211 --> 01:22:44,131
And I try to understand

940
01:22:44,339 --> 01:22:48,343
that some very good people
do some very bad things.

941
01:23:04,234 --> 01:23:07,321
You know when I was working
for Shaughnessy,

942
01:23:07,529 --> 01:23:11,200
I did something very, very bad.

943
01:23:11,408 --> 01:23:15,829
Illegal. I was a prosecutor then.

944
01:23:16,038 --> 01:23:20,792
This thing I did. I was very upset by it
and decided to leave.

945
01:23:21,001 --> 01:23:25,047
So I left.
I became a defending attorney.

946
01:23:25,255 --> 01:23:29,176
The irony being that everyone
assumed I was lying anyhow.

947
01:23:29,384 --> 01:23:32,679
I made myself this little promise that...

948
01:23:35,390 --> 01:23:38,977
...l would reserve my lies
for other than my public life.

949
01:23:51,698 --> 01:23:55,035
You print any of this,
I'll sue your fucking ass.

950
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:24,439
- All right, so I made a little mistake.
- No shit.

951
01:24:25,858 --> 01:24:28,986
What do you want? A new suit?
I'll buy you a new suit.

952
01:24:29,194 --> 01:24:32,698
You made a mistake?
You told us the third man did it.

953
01:24:32,906 --> 01:24:36,076
You got your third man.
And a fourth man and a fifth man...

954
01:24:36,285 --> 01:24:38,662
What are you going to do, Marty?

955
01:24:38,871 --> 01:24:41,582
I don't know. I really fucked up here.

956
01:24:42,457 --> 01:24:44,418
You were right.

957
01:24:44,626 --> 01:24:49,423
- So how are you gonna get him off?
- I don't know.

958
01:24:51,049 --> 01:24:54,845
What I know is that Aaron did
not commit first-degree murder.

959
01:24:55,053 --> 01:24:58,098
- He stabbed him a billion times...
- Not Aaron.

960
01:24:58,307 --> 01:25:03,103
To convict someone of a capital crime
the State must prove intent.

961
01:25:03,312 --> 01:25:07,232
- Roy had intent, Aaron didn't.
- Then you have to plead insanity...

962
01:25:07,441 --> 01:25:10,736
...which we can't do mid-trial,
unless you plan a career change.

963
01:25:10,944 --> 01:25:13,363
I could've been mistaken,
but I wasn't wrong.

964
01:25:13,572 --> 01:25:16,992
Aaron is innocent.
It's Roy who is guilty.

965
01:25:17,201 --> 01:25:19,119
He doesn't need a lawyer,
he needs an exorcist.

966
01:25:19,328 --> 01:25:22,414
You're full of shit.
You weren't there. You didn't see it.

967
01:25:22,623 --> 01:25:27,586
He's one sick boy who's been fucked
around by his father, by his priest.

968
01:25:27,794 --> 01:25:32,549
It's our job to make sure the jury
believes he doesn't deserve to die.

969
01:25:32,758 --> 01:25:35,469
- OK.
- OK. How do we do it?

970
01:25:37,304 --> 01:25:40,432
By somehow introducing
this whole abuse thing.

971
01:25:46,897 --> 01:25:51,026
- The tape.
- That's crazy. That gives him motive.

972
01:25:51,235 --> 01:25:54,446
No, it looks like that, but it's...

973
01:25:54,655 --> 01:25:58,575
No, actually,
it turns this whole thing around.

974
01:25:58,784 --> 01:26:02,955
It gives concrete documentation
of what Rushman did to this kid.

975
01:26:03,163 --> 01:26:05,374
But we can't put it in. You know that.

976
01:26:07,251 --> 01:26:09,336
But we're not going to.

977
01:26:16,176 --> 01:26:18,345
Oh, fuck!

978
01:26:25,853 --> 01:26:28,730
- OK.
- Good.

979
01:27:04,474 --> 01:27:07,978
What the hell are you doing?
You know damn well who it is.

980
01:27:08,187 --> 01:27:10,439
- Barleycorn's, Marty. Now.
- Janet?

981
01:27:10,647 --> 01:27:13,108
Cute porno. Part of your collection?

982
01:27:27,581 --> 01:27:28,916
Hey.

983
01:27:30,417 --> 01:27:33,504
Where did you get it? Steal it?

984
01:27:33,712 --> 01:27:35,714
- From the crime scene?
- I don't know anything...

985
01:27:35,923 --> 01:27:38,175
- You are such a liar.
- Think about it.

986
01:27:38,383 --> 01:27:41,929
If it contains that,
I wouldn't give it to you. It's motive.

987
01:27:42,137 --> 01:27:43,555
You had to give it to me.

988
01:27:43,764 --> 01:27:48,101
If you introduced it, the jury'd despise
you for dishonouring the bishop.

989
01:27:48,310 --> 01:27:52,606
If you get me to show it, motive or
no motive, I'm the one who looks bad,

990
01:27:52,814 --> 01:27:57,110
and you gain sympathy
for your poor, little, abused boy.

991
01:27:57,986 --> 01:27:59,696
- You think so?
- I hate you.

992
01:28:02,741 --> 01:28:04,076
Don't use it.

993
01:28:06,203 --> 01:28:08,997
I have no intention of using it.

994
01:28:10,749 --> 01:28:13,794
- The usual, Stu.
- You got it.

995
01:28:19,216 --> 01:28:22,219
- You're up to even more than that.
- I'm not up to anything.

996
01:28:22,427 --> 01:28:26,598
You're opening a door for me with
a tiger on the other end, and I don't...

997
01:28:26,807 --> 01:28:29,643
You know who you'd really upset?
Shaughnessy.

998
01:28:29,852 --> 01:28:31,645
- Fuck him.
- Fuck him?

999
01:28:31,854 --> 01:28:34,273
Fuck you.

1000
01:28:37,192 --> 01:28:39,444
Thanks a lot.

1001
01:28:41,738 --> 01:28:45,534
- If this is not your motive, what is?
- I have motive.

1002
01:28:46,285 --> 01:28:47,995
Yeah, what is it?

1003
01:28:49,538 --> 01:28:52,332
I'm really gonna tell you.

1004
01:28:52,541 --> 01:28:55,085
Better tell the jury soon.
Time's running out.

1005
01:28:55,294 --> 01:28:56,795
Here you go.

1006
01:28:59,089 --> 01:29:01,884
You think you've got me, huh?

1007
01:29:03,385 --> 01:29:09,558
You think because you know me as
well as you do, you know how I think.

1008
01:29:09,766 --> 01:29:12,686
Well, I know how you think.

1009
01:29:18,192 --> 01:29:20,527
You know what I'm thinking?

1010
01:29:26,074 --> 01:29:28,577
What happened to your face?

1011
01:29:28,785 --> 01:29:32,998
I... I bumped it
in a medicine cabinet.

1012
01:29:38,086 --> 01:29:41,465
No, that was a girl on her way out.

1013
01:29:46,970 --> 01:29:50,766
- We should come back here later.
- They close in ten minutes.

1014
01:29:50,974 --> 01:29:52,976
No, after.

1015
01:29:53,185 --> 01:29:55,312
After the trial.

1016
01:29:56,522 --> 01:29:58,732
When we got nothing to lose.

1017
01:30:02,569 --> 01:30:05,864
How can your timing
be so good in a courtroom

1018
01:30:06,073 --> 01:30:08,534
and so bad in real life?

1019
01:30:11,453 --> 01:30:16,208
I'll think about it later.
I hate you too much right now.

1020
01:30:27,219 --> 01:30:29,680
You got a visitor.

1021
01:30:30,347 --> 01:30:32,432
Here she comes.

1022
01:30:34,393 --> 01:30:36,770
Talk to you later.

1023
01:30:36,979 --> 01:30:38,981
Janet.

1024
01:30:39,189 --> 01:30:41,149
Morning.

1025
01:30:44,570 --> 01:30:47,030
So where's the tape?

1026
01:30:47,239 --> 01:30:49,908
There's some pretty ugly stuff
on that tape.

1027
01:30:50,117 --> 01:30:53,453
- Yes, there is.
- Who would've thought?

1028
01:30:55,455 --> 01:30:59,585
- Where did it come from?
- Landed on my front door. No note.

1029
01:30:59,793 --> 01:31:01,795
- Vail?
- Who else?

1030
01:31:02,004 --> 01:31:04,506
Clever prick.

1031
01:31:04,715 --> 01:31:06,967
What do you think he's up to?

1032
01:31:07,176 --> 01:31:09,386
- I honestly don't know.
- Cut the crap.

1033
01:31:09,595 --> 01:31:12,222
You know him well.
You were balling him.

1034
01:31:14,725 --> 01:31:16,685
- Where is it?
- At home.

1035
01:31:20,063 --> 01:31:22,399
I have some advice for you.

1036
01:31:22,608 --> 01:31:26,403
If you have aspirations beyond
this particular office,

1037
01:31:26,612 --> 01:31:30,282
pick up your handbag,
go home and destroy this tape

1038
01:31:30,490 --> 01:31:33,327
you should've destroyed, like I did.

1039
01:31:34,912 --> 01:31:36,872
You don't think Vail has a copy?

1040
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:40,042
You don't think there's an original?

1041
01:31:43,420 --> 01:31:46,340
Stampler is on trial,
not the Catholic church.

1042
01:31:46,548 --> 01:31:50,260
If you haven't found another motive
to hang him on, God help you.

1043
01:32:01,230 --> 01:32:03,899
All rise.

1044
01:32:04,983 --> 01:32:07,528
Please, sit down.

1045
01:32:11,865 --> 01:32:14,117
Madame Prosecutor.

1046
01:32:19,790 --> 01:32:21,583
Miss Venable.

1047
01:32:23,001 --> 01:32:26,296
The State calls Thomas Goodman.

1048
01:32:26,505 --> 01:32:27,840
Objection, Your Honour.

1049
01:32:28,048 --> 01:32:31,760
Prosecution knows Mr Goodman
is my investigator in this case,

1050
01:32:31,969 --> 01:32:34,847
and under the Work Product Rule
he can't be compelled to testify.

1051
01:32:35,055 --> 01:32:37,432
- Permission to approach the bench?
- Granted.

1052
01:32:44,606 --> 01:32:48,569
I have important evidence
which the witness can authenticate.

1053
01:32:48,777 --> 01:32:54,199
That's Mr Vail's privilege. If he doesn't
want Goodman to testify, he won't.

1054
01:32:54,408 --> 01:32:57,035
Make a decision, Mr Vail.

1055
01:32:59,830 --> 01:33:03,000
- You ever been to my apartment?
- No.

1056
01:33:03,208 --> 01:33:06,628
- By that I mean my apartment building.
- Allegedly.

1057
01:33:06,837 --> 01:33:11,425
I'm sorry. You have or you haven't.
"Allegedly" doesn't figure into it.

1058
01:33:12,259 --> 01:33:15,554
I have...been there, yes.

1059
01:33:15,762 --> 01:33:19,183
- Why did you go there?
- I was delivering something.

1060
01:33:19,391 --> 01:33:21,685
For whom?

1061
01:33:23,061 --> 01:33:24,313
Martin Vail.

1062
01:33:24,521 --> 01:33:28,650
Mr Vail sent you
to deliver something to me.

1063
01:33:28,859 --> 01:33:31,361
- Yes.
- What was it?

1064
01:33:32,863 --> 01:33:34,198
A video tape.

1065
01:33:34,406 --> 01:33:37,576
Could this be the tape
you delivered for Mr Vail?

1066
01:33:37,784 --> 01:33:39,620
I have a feeling it is, yes.

1067
01:33:39,828 --> 01:33:42,956
The People place
this video tape in evidence.

1068
01:33:43,207 --> 01:33:44,791
So ordered. Please index.

1069
01:33:45,042 --> 01:33:49,087
Where did Mr Vail get this tape,
if it is the same one?

1070
01:33:49,338 --> 01:33:53,133
He took it from the closet
of Archbishop Rushman.

1071
01:33:53,342 --> 01:33:55,052
- Stole it.
- Borrowed it.

1072
01:33:55,260 --> 01:33:58,847
Once I made the transfer for him,
I returned it.

1073
01:33:59,056 --> 01:34:01,517
Can you describe what's on the tape?

1074
01:34:01,725 --> 01:34:06,605
There was a sermon
by Archbishop Rushman, a rehearsal,

1075
01:34:06,813 --> 01:34:08,565
followed by...

1076
01:34:11,485 --> 01:34:15,531
- ..a kind of home movie.
- A home movie? Of what?

1077
01:34:15,781 --> 01:34:17,157
- Some altar boys.
- And?

1078
01:34:18,742 --> 01:34:20,244
- A girl.
- Doing what?

1079
01:34:23,247 --> 01:34:26,375
An altar boy lesson of some kind?

1080
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:30,087
Having sex.

1081
01:34:31,171 --> 01:34:32,965
Quiet.

1082
01:34:33,215 --> 01:34:36,176
A porno movie.

1083
01:34:36,426 --> 01:34:37,719
- Mm, yes.
- Yes. Now.

1084
01:34:37,970 --> 01:34:42,975
How is it that this tape, this porno tape,

1085
01:34:43,225 --> 01:34:47,020
was in the Archbishop's closet
in order for Vail to find it there?

1086
01:34:47,271 --> 01:34:51,149
- He was the...director.
- Who was?

1087
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:54,987
- Archbishop Rushman.
- Quiet!

1088
01:34:56,947 --> 01:35:01,952
And was the defendant one of
the altar boys performing in the movie?

1089
01:35:03,620 --> 01:35:08,166
- Yes, he was.
- Was his girlfriend, Linda Forbes?

1090
01:35:09,334 --> 01:35:10,669
Yes, she was.

1091
01:35:10,919 --> 01:35:14,548
Did it appear to you
that the defendant was enjoying

1092
01:35:14,798 --> 01:35:17,467
performing in this film
with his girlfriend?

1093
01:35:17,676 --> 01:35:19,803
No, he does not.

1094
01:35:20,721 --> 01:35:24,558
I will not ask you if you
think we've uncovered motive here.

1095
01:35:24,808 --> 01:35:29,438
We will decide that for ourselves
once we've all seen the video tape.

1096
01:35:30,314 --> 01:35:32,983
No further questions.

1097
01:35:34,151 --> 01:35:37,613
Does Defence wish to cross?

1098
01:35:39,948 --> 01:35:42,409
- No, Your Honour.
- Court's in recess.

1099
01:35:42,659 --> 01:35:46,413
Bailiff, please set up for the tape.
Mr Goodman, you're excused.

1100
01:35:50,959 --> 01:35:53,545
Thanks for the advice.

1101
01:35:59,092 --> 01:36:02,596
- Mr Vail said she was your girlfriend.
- Yes, she was.

1102
01:36:02,846 --> 01:36:07,643
- How did you meet?
- We were both at the Savior House.

1103
01:36:07,893 --> 01:36:10,312
I was an altar boy,

1104
01:36:10,562 --> 01:36:15,692
and she was working
for Bishop Rushman.

1105
01:36:15,943 --> 01:36:18,111
Doing what?

1106
01:36:23,742 --> 01:36:26,703
Were you sleeping
with anyone else at the time?

1107
01:36:26,954 --> 01:36:29,498
- No, no.
- Was she?

1108
01:36:31,875 --> 01:36:34,253
N-n-no.

1109
01:36:35,921 --> 01:36:38,382
Has she been to see you, Aaron?

1110
01:36:38,632 --> 01:36:42,010
Yeah. Yeah, I'm still here.

1111
01:36:44,429 --> 01:36:45,973
What?

1112
01:37:29,766 --> 01:37:33,020
Mr Vail, are you prepared to proceed
with your first witness?

1113
01:37:46,033 --> 01:37:49,411
Yes, Your Honour.
The Defence calls John Shaughnessy.

1114
01:37:54,875 --> 01:37:57,628
The People object. Mr Shaughnessy
has never been identified as...

1115
01:37:57,878 --> 01:38:01,423
- Your Honour, may I approach?
- Yes, you may.

1116
01:38:05,052 --> 01:38:09,556
My client is on trial for his life. He
maintains there was a third person.

1117
01:38:09,806 --> 01:38:12,267
Can Mr Shaughnessy confirm that?

1118
01:38:12,518 --> 01:38:15,854
The US Constitution
takes precedence here,

1119
01:38:16,104 --> 01:38:19,024
permitting calling any witness
to prove innocence.

1120
01:38:19,233 --> 01:38:23,862
That's stated in the Sixth Amendment
and profound in Brady vs. Maryland.

1121
01:38:25,989 --> 01:38:31,495
Mr Shaughnessy, you sit on the board
of the Rushman Foundation?

1122
01:38:31,703 --> 01:38:33,705
I am an honorary board member.

1123
01:38:33,956 --> 01:38:37,125
Explain the nature
and purpose of this foundation.

1124
01:38:37,334 --> 01:38:39,461
It was founded by the late Archbishop.

1125
01:38:39,711 --> 01:38:44,091
Its purpose is to invest in projects
for the greater good of the community.

1126
01:38:44,299 --> 01:38:47,135
The greater good of the community,
OK.

1127
01:38:47,386 --> 01:38:51,139
Would that be true
in the case of the now bankrupt...

1128
01:38:51,390 --> 01:38:54,726
- ...South River Housing Development?
- Yes.

1129
01:38:54,977 --> 01:38:59,189
Could you tell the court why the South
River project was abandoned?

1130
01:38:59,439 --> 01:39:02,192
There was a difference of opinion
as to the costs.

1131
01:39:02,442 --> 01:39:05,112
Wasn't there also
a difference of opinion

1132
01:39:05,320 --> 01:39:08,407
between the investors
and the late Archbishop?

1133
01:39:08,657 --> 01:39:11,994
- I don't recall.
- You don't...

1134
01:39:13,120 --> 01:39:15,956
What kind of money
are we talking about?

1135
01:39:18,667 --> 01:39:25,299
How much money was invested
in this failed South River enterprise?

1136
01:39:29,303 --> 01:39:32,306
- 60 million dollars.
- Quiet.

1137
01:39:32,556 --> 01:39:34,516
60 million dollars!

1138
01:39:36,393 --> 01:39:38,687
Wow, that's a lot of money.

1139
01:39:39,688 --> 01:39:42,691
You and the Archbishop
have been friends for 20 years?

1140
01:39:42,900 --> 01:39:46,069
- You knew each other well.
- That's right.

1141
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:50,365
- Did that tape's content surprise you?
- Yes, of course.

1142
01:39:50,574 --> 01:39:54,203
You've never heard any allegations
against the Archbishop?

1143
01:39:54,453 --> 01:39:55,913
Not that I recall, no.

1144
01:39:56,121 --> 01:39:59,291
Especially since you were State's
Attorney for the last 1 5 years,

1145
01:39:59,541 --> 01:40:03,921
you've supervised all prosecutions
in Cook County during that time,

1146
01:40:04,171 --> 01:40:07,174
especially the prosecutions
of prominent figures.

1147
01:40:07,424 --> 01:40:11,011
I also have a staff of
a thousand of the best prosecutors...

1148
01:40:11,220 --> 01:40:15,516
As State's Attorney
it was up to you, ultimately, to decide...

1149
01:40:15,724 --> 01:40:18,477
- ...who would be indicted.
- Yes.

1150
01:40:21,313 --> 01:40:23,524
Let me just take you back now.

1151
01:40:23,732 --> 01:40:28,111
Let's go back to June 1 985.

1152
01:40:29,321 --> 01:40:32,407
Do you recall any allegations
of sexual misconduct...

1153
01:40:32,658 --> 01:40:36,370
- ...against the Archbishop then?
- I don't recall that, no.

1154
01:40:36,620 --> 01:40:40,999
Do you recall a young man
by the name of Michael O'Donnell

1155
01:40:41,250 --> 01:40:45,629
who came to the felony review unit
at your office?

1156
01:40:49,633 --> 01:40:52,886
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1157
01:40:53,095 --> 01:40:59,810
That's confusing because a document
from the Chicago Metropolitan Police

1158
01:41:00,060 --> 01:41:06,066
says that Michael O'Donnell spoke
to the supervisor for two weeks,

1159
01:41:06,316 --> 01:41:10,696
explaining sexual abuse he suffered
at the hands of Archbishop Rushman.

1160
01:41:12,406 --> 01:41:17,578
Isn't it also true, Mr State's Attorney,
that you then decided that your friend

1161
01:41:17,828 --> 01:41:21,874
was not going to stand trial
for any of it?

1162
01:41:22,082 --> 01:41:23,876
He owed you big time, John.

1163
01:41:24,084 --> 01:41:27,337
You must have been pissed off
when he pulled out of South River.

1164
01:41:28,338 --> 01:41:32,634
He just said, "I can't take it any more"?
He said, "No!"

1165
01:41:32,843 --> 01:41:36,805
You and your investors
had 60 million reasons to kill him!

1166
01:41:37,055 --> 01:41:40,309
- You little cocksucker!
- That's it. Witness dismissed.

1167
01:41:40,559 --> 01:41:44,146
- Vail, in my chambers now.
- That's for Joey Pinero, shithead.

1168
01:41:49,359 --> 01:41:51,945
Start looking for a job.

1169
01:42:00,996 --> 01:42:05,959
You think you can use my courtroom to
wage vendettas and settle old scores,

1170
01:42:06,168 --> 01:42:08,128
you are sorely mistaken.

1171
01:42:08,378 --> 01:42:11,548
I'm striking Shaughnessy's testimony
from the record as irrelevant,

1172
01:42:11,798 --> 01:42:15,052
and I'm holding you in contempt
to the tune of 1 0,000 dollars.

1173
01:42:15,302 --> 01:42:19,056
You're saying that I can't get
a fair trial in your courtroom?

1174
01:42:19,264 --> 01:42:22,434
Be very careful, Mr Vail.
You're on dangerous ground.

1175
01:42:22,643 --> 01:42:25,020
You want the cheque
made out to you?

1176
01:42:25,270 --> 01:42:27,814
You want me to take you off this case?

1177
01:42:28,065 --> 01:42:31,318
You're making a mockery of
my courtroom, and I won't allow it.

1178
01:42:31,568 --> 01:42:37,241
I suggest you start representing your
client and stop representing yourself.

1179
01:42:46,166 --> 01:42:49,753
- Can we do this later?
- No, I want to stay with this.

1180
01:42:51,004 --> 01:42:55,300
- I'm feeling very, very tired.
- Yeah, I know.

1181
01:42:55,551 --> 01:42:57,678
Why does talking
about Linda Forbes upset you?

1182
01:42:57,928 --> 01:42:59,888
It doesn't. Ijust...

1183
01:43:02,182 --> 01:43:04,935
- OK.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1184
01:43:08,522 --> 01:43:13,068
- You know what I can do with this?
- How the fuck should I know!

1185
01:43:21,910 --> 01:43:26,039
Dr Arrington, how much time
have you spent with Aaron Stampler?

1186
01:43:26,248 --> 01:43:30,377
- Around 60 hours.
- What did you find in your evaluation?

1187
01:43:30,586 --> 01:43:34,339
Mr Stampler suffers from
an acute disassociative condition.

1188
01:43:34,548 --> 01:43:38,552
- Multiple personality disorder.
- Objection, Your Honour.

1189
01:43:38,760 --> 01:43:41,138
She's only stating
what she's personally observed.

1190
01:43:41,346 --> 01:43:43,473
- Your Honour.
- Counsellors.

1191
01:43:45,392 --> 01:43:48,729
- I know what you're doing.
- Excuse us for a minute?

1192
01:43:50,731 --> 01:43:53,358
If he wants to question
his client's sanity...

1193
01:43:53,567 --> 01:43:56,111
I'm trying to establish
a medical basis for amnesia.

1194
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:59,489
That's not what he's doing.
He's saying he's crazy.

1195
01:43:59,698 --> 01:44:02,701
- Are you?
- No, I am not.

1196
01:44:02,910 --> 01:44:07,122
I'll allow you to proceed
with this witness if you're very careful.

1197
01:44:07,372 --> 01:44:10,542
Absolutely. Yes.

1198
01:44:10,751 --> 01:44:12,544
Write down that he said that.

1199
01:44:13,545 --> 01:44:16,548
All right, where were we?

1200
01:44:20,260 --> 01:44:23,347
Now, could Aaron Stampler

1201
01:44:23,597 --> 01:44:28,310
have been present during the murder
of Archbishop Rushman...

1202
01:44:28,519 --> 01:44:30,479
- ...and not remember it?
- Yes, he could.

1203
01:44:30,687 --> 01:44:33,065
Could you explain that, please?

1204
01:44:33,273 --> 01:44:37,736
Stampler's state was such that his
body could be present at a homicide,

1205
01:44:37,986 --> 01:44:40,822
and yet his mind
would be unable to recall it.

1206
01:44:41,031 --> 01:44:44,451
- How would this be possible?
- This neurological mechanism...

1207
01:44:44,660 --> 01:44:48,247
...began with the early abuse
suffered at the hands of his father.

1208
01:44:48,455 --> 01:44:53,836
In defence Aaron's psyche splintered
into two separate personalities.

1209
01:44:54,044 --> 01:44:56,672
- Your Honour.
- I didn't say it. I did not say it...

1210
01:44:56,880 --> 01:45:00,467
You've been warned twice.
You wanna pursue this?

1211
01:45:00,676 --> 01:45:05,055
And I suggest you think long and hard
before answering.

1212
01:45:06,765 --> 01:45:09,309
Your Honour, just one last question.

1213
01:45:14,231 --> 01:45:16,775
All right, Dr Arrington...

1214
01:45:17,776 --> 01:45:22,739
...in your opinion is Aaron Stampler
capable of murder?

1215
01:45:22,948 --> 01:45:26,869
No, he's far too traumatised to
express normal anger and frustration.

1216
01:45:27,119 --> 01:45:28,996
He keeps his emotions repressed,

1217
01:45:29,246 --> 01:45:31,623
which is why he created Roy,
who is capable...

1218
01:45:31,832 --> 01:45:34,209
- Objection.
- That's enough, Mr Vail.

1219
01:45:34,459 --> 01:45:38,505
The jury will disregard this witness'
last statement, as will the court.

1220
01:45:38,714 --> 01:45:42,718
- Prosecutor, do you wish to cross?
- You bet I do.

1221
01:45:44,261 --> 01:45:47,764
Since you brought it up,
against the instructions of the court,

1222
01:45:48,015 --> 01:45:52,811
is multiple personality disorder
your primary area of expertise?

1223
01:45:53,020 --> 01:45:54,813
It's not my primary field, no.

1224
01:45:55,022 --> 01:45:58,942
Is forensic psychiatry
your primary area of expertise?

1225
01:45:59,193 --> 01:46:02,029
- No, I'm a neuropsychologist.
- I see.

1226
01:46:02,237 --> 01:46:08,327
So you have no forensic experience
and you're more of an academic?

1227
01:46:10,037 --> 01:46:13,207
Then you will forgive
this rather academic question.

1228
01:46:13,832 --> 01:46:16,835
I'm driving, somebody cuts me off.

1229
01:46:17,044 --> 01:46:20,297
I feel like killing this guy,
but I don't. Now do l?

1230
01:46:20,506 --> 01:46:22,633
- I would hope not.
- That's right.

1231
01:46:22,841 --> 01:46:26,345
Things happen to us.
People wrong us.

1232
01:46:26,595 --> 01:46:31,058
But we don't all invent psychopaths
to do our dirty work for us, doctor?

1233
01:46:31,266 --> 01:46:34,186
I'm not suggesting
you have multiple personalities.

1234
01:46:34,394 --> 01:46:36,772
- I'm saying Mr Stampler does.
- Yes, I know. We heard.

1235
01:46:39,316 --> 01:46:44,738
You have also testified that you have
met this... What was his name again?

1236
01:46:44,947 --> 01:46:46,573
- Roy.
- Roy what?

1237
01:46:47,115 --> 01:46:49,159
- He didn't give a last name.
- I see.

1238
01:46:49,368 --> 01:46:53,539
Did this Roy tell you
that he had murdered the Archbishop?

1239
01:46:53,747 --> 01:46:56,208
Mr Vail was with him, I was outside,

1240
01:46:56,416 --> 01:46:59,503
but soon after I was in the room
and saw both Roy

1241
01:46:59,711 --> 01:47:02,631
and his transformation back to Aaron.

1242
01:47:02,840 --> 01:47:07,970
Did you happen to tape
this appearance of Aaron...?

1243
01:47:09,721 --> 01:47:14,101
Oh, I'm sorry.
I just cannot get used to this name.

1244
01:47:14,309 --> 01:47:17,062
- Roy.
- Did you?

1245
01:47:18,438 --> 01:47:20,899
- No, the tape was off.
- Off?

1246
01:47:23,527 --> 01:47:28,574
So you have no record whatsoever
of his appearance.

1247
01:47:28,824 --> 01:47:30,701
- No.
- No.

1248
01:47:32,494 --> 01:47:36,248
- Does Aaron know right from wrong?
- Yes, he does.

1249
01:47:36,498 --> 01:47:39,459
- If Aaron butchered the Archbishop...
- Objection.

1250
01:47:39,668 --> 01:47:43,672
...would he know
if Aaron murdered the Archbishop?

1251
01:47:43,881 --> 01:47:48,343
- Would he know he'd broken the law?
- Yes, he would. But it wasn't Aaron...

1252
01:47:48,552 --> 01:47:52,306
Oh, yes, I know, doctor. It was Roy.

1253
01:47:55,601 --> 01:47:58,687
That's all.
No further questions, Your Honour.

1254
01:47:58,896 --> 01:48:00,647
Witness may step down.

1255
01:48:00,856 --> 01:48:05,485
If you'd like to re-open your case
and call the State's psychiatrist...

1256
01:48:05,694 --> 01:48:08,530
- ...l will certainly agree to it.
- No, l...

1257
01:48:08,739 --> 01:48:12,868
I don't think that's necessary.
I think we all get the picture here.

1258
01:48:13,076 --> 01:48:16,455
Mr Vail, are you ready to proceed?

1259
01:48:19,374 --> 01:48:20,876
Would you like a recess?

1260
01:49:26,316 --> 01:49:27,734
Roy?

1261
01:49:29,236 --> 01:49:31,113
Aaron.

1262
01:49:33,991 --> 01:49:38,370
Could you tell us a little about
your relationship with the Archbishop?

1263
01:49:38,579 --> 01:49:43,166
Well, he was like a father to me.
I loved him very much.

1264
01:49:43,375 --> 01:49:45,544
Why did you love him?

1265
01:49:45,752 --> 01:49:47,462
- Why?
- Aha.

1266
01:49:48,547 --> 01:49:51,842
Well, he...he s-saved my life.

1267
01:49:52,634 --> 01:49:57,598
He was the only person who ever
treated me like I was worth anything.

1268
01:49:57,806 --> 01:50:00,184
Stop your whining, little girl. Be a man.

1269
01:50:04,354 --> 01:50:08,567
We've all seen that tape
that you were in, Aaron.

1270
01:50:08,775 --> 01:50:12,863
How did that make you feel? Did it
change your feelings about Rushman?

1271
01:50:13,071 --> 01:50:14,990
No.

1272
01:50:15,199 --> 01:50:18,035
He was a wonderful man.

1273
01:50:18,243 --> 01:50:22,831
So you didn't feel anger towards him
for forcing you to perform in that tape?

1274
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:26,460
No, he did everýthing for me.

1275
01:50:26,668 --> 01:50:30,172
There was nothing else
I could do for him, and he needed it.

1276
01:50:30,380 --> 01:50:33,091
Do you know someone named Roy?

1277
01:50:35,594 --> 01:50:37,513
No, I don't.

1278
01:50:37,721 --> 01:50:42,726
You heard Dr Arrington's testimony
about what she and I saw at the jail.

1279
01:50:42,935 --> 01:50:46,021
There are strange things going on.
Do you remember?

1280
01:50:46,230 --> 01:50:50,317
I heard what she said,
but I don't remember any of that.

1281
01:50:50,526 --> 01:50:53,946
Did you kill Archbishop Rushman?

1282
01:50:54,905 --> 01:50:57,282
No, sir, I did not.

1283
01:51:02,829 --> 01:51:04,623
Thank you.

1284
01:51:06,792 --> 01:51:08,961
Your witness.

1285
01:51:15,551 --> 01:51:18,762
Mr Stampler,
would you like some water?

1286
01:51:22,432 --> 01:51:25,686
- N-no, ma'am.
- You sure?

1287
01:51:26,562 --> 01:51:28,939
Ye-yes, ma'am.

1288
01:51:36,697 --> 01:51:40,075
Mr Stampler, did you believe
that the Archbishop wore masks?

1289
01:51:43,954 --> 01:51:45,747
I'm sorry, what did you say?

1290
01:51:45,956 --> 01:51:51,128
Do you think he acted one way
in public and another way in private?

1291
01:51:51,336 --> 01:51:53,881
N-no, I don't think that.

1292
01:51:54,089 --> 01:51:56,925
Isn't that why you underlined
the Hawthorne passage?

1293
01:51:59,136 --> 01:52:00,929
Mr Stampler?

1294
01:52:03,223 --> 01:52:05,350
No, I did not underline that book.

1295
01:52:05,559 --> 01:52:08,437
- You didn't underline it?
- No, ma'am.

1296
01:52:08,645 --> 01:52:11,857
And you didn't carve the numbers
of that passage into his chest?

1297
01:52:12,065 --> 01:52:15,903
No, ma'am, I did not.
I told you l...

1298
01:52:16,111 --> 01:52:18,572
You loved him.

1299
01:52:18,780 --> 01:52:21,408
You loved him like a father.

1300
01:52:21,617 --> 01:52:24,578
Even though
he made you and your girlfriend

1301
01:52:24,786 --> 01:52:28,916
perform demeaning sexual acts
for his own gratification.

1302
01:52:29,124 --> 01:52:31,543
No, you don't understand. He...

1303
01:52:31,752 --> 01:52:36,548
There was no other way for him
to cast out his demons. He...

1304
01:52:36,757 --> 01:52:40,552
He needed to get off, Aaron.
That's what he was doing.

1305
01:52:40,761 --> 01:52:44,389
That's what he needed you for.
To perform like a circus animal.

1306
01:52:44,598 --> 01:52:47,100
- That was your function in his life.
- N-no.

1307
01:52:47,309 --> 01:52:51,396
Oh, Mr Stampler, I'm gonna ask
you straight because I am tired.

1308
01:52:51,605 --> 01:52:55,108
I've had enough of this sordidness,
and I wanna go home.

1309
01:52:55,317 --> 01:52:59,488
And I wanna wash my hands,
and I wanna forget all about you

1310
01:52:59,696 --> 01:53:01,490
and Archbishop Rushman.

1311
01:53:01,698 --> 01:53:05,077
Did the Archbishop force you
and your girlfriend and others

1312
01:53:05,285 --> 01:53:09,331
to perform sexual acts
while he watched? Yes or no?

1313
01:53:12,251 --> 01:53:15,003
- Yes, he did, but...
- Yes. Yes, he forced you.

1314
01:53:15,212 --> 01:53:19,258
He forced you using a threat
of expulsion from Savior House

1315
01:53:19,466 --> 01:53:24,054
and a life on the street with no heat
and no water and no food.

1316
01:53:24,263 --> 01:53:27,558
He put you in front of a camera!
He made you take off your clothes!

1317
01:53:27,766 --> 01:53:30,936
And you don't think
that's another side?

1318
01:53:31,144 --> 01:53:32,980
Another face of a man
that we all thought...

1319
01:53:33,188 --> 01:53:37,109
- No! No.
- Someone did that to me, I'd kill him.

1320
01:53:37,985 --> 01:53:41,238
I would stab him 78 times
with a butcher knife!

1321
01:53:41,446 --> 01:53:43,866
I would chop off his fingers!
I would slash his throat open!

1322
01:53:44,074 --> 01:53:49,580
I would carve numbers into his chest!
I would gouge out his eyes! I swear.

1323
01:53:51,373 --> 01:53:53,458
But that's me.

1324
01:54:01,925 --> 01:54:05,137
- No further questions.
- Where the hell are you going?

1325
01:54:05,345 --> 01:54:07,848
Look at me
when I'm talking to you, bitch!

1326
01:54:08,432 --> 01:54:10,017
Fuck you, lady! Come here!

1327
01:54:10,225 --> 01:54:11,852
Order! Bailiff! Order!

1328
01:54:14,771 --> 01:54:16,899
Let's play rough! Come on. Back off!

1329
01:54:17,900 --> 01:54:22,613
- Roy!
- Keep coming, and I'll break her neck!

1330
01:54:22,821 --> 01:54:25,782
- Come here and talk.
- Fuck you, Marty! I'm walking out!

1331
01:54:31,788 --> 01:54:34,708
No! No! Don't you... !

1332
01:54:42,508 --> 01:54:44,176
You OK?

1333
01:55:11,954 --> 01:55:15,457
Don't even think of lighting
that cigarette, Miss Venable.

1334
01:55:20,838 --> 01:55:23,257
- How's your neck?
- I'll live.

1335
01:55:23,465 --> 01:55:25,092
I could call a doctor.

1336
01:55:25,801 --> 01:55:30,597
Mr Shaughnessy just called
to inform me there will be no mistrial.

1337
01:55:30,806 --> 01:55:33,267
- As if that was his right.
- I can't believe...

1338
01:55:33,475 --> 01:55:35,561
...that scumbag has the balls to call.

1339
01:55:35,769 --> 01:55:37,354
No thanks.

1340
01:55:37,563 --> 01:55:43,026
What matters to me is what you have
to say. Your case has been damaged.

1341
01:55:43,902 --> 01:55:46,572
In fairness to the Prosecution
I would declare a mistrial,

1342
01:55:46,780 --> 01:55:51,034
regardless of what Shaughnessy
and Vail think, if that's what you want.

1343
01:55:51,243 --> 01:55:54,288
The Prosecution doesn't wanna try
this case again even if it could.

1344
01:55:54,496 --> 01:55:57,291
Which it can't. At least not by me.

1345
01:55:57,499 --> 01:56:00,335
I think I can guarantee you
there's no one

1346
01:56:00,544 --> 01:56:05,382
in the DA's office who will.
So...it's up to you.

1347
01:56:05,591 --> 01:56:08,760
I'm gonna dismiss the jury
in favour of a bench trial

1348
01:56:08,969 --> 01:56:12,931
and a blind plea of not guilty
by reason of insanity. Yes?

1349
01:56:13,140 --> 01:56:16,977
The defendant will be remanded
to Elgin for a 30-day evaluation period.

1350
01:56:17,186 --> 01:56:19,229
Let them decide
the term of his commitment.

1351
01:56:19,438 --> 01:56:22,691
- Do you have a problem with that?
- He'll be out in a month.

1352
01:56:22,900 --> 01:56:26,028
Take it up with the Legislature,
Miss Venable.

1353
01:56:28,572 --> 01:56:30,532
I'm going home.

1354
01:56:35,621 --> 01:56:39,166
- Your Honour.
- No, I won't refund your contempt fine.

1355
01:56:39,374 --> 01:56:43,462
Next time you wanna get a client off
on insanity, you plead that way,

1356
01:56:43,670 --> 01:56:45,506
or I'll have you disbarred.

1357
01:57:14,826 --> 01:57:19,122
- You OK?
- Am I OK? Do I seem OK?

1358
01:57:19,331 --> 01:57:22,918
I get attacked by this sick twist,
I've lost the case, I'm out of a job.

1359
01:57:23,126 --> 01:57:30,092
No, I'm not OK. But hey, you won,
justice was done. Who cares, right?

1360
01:57:31,468 --> 01:57:33,262
Congratulations.

1361
01:57:39,476 --> 01:57:41,103
You knew, didn't you?

1362
01:57:41,311 --> 01:57:44,189
You knew if I went after him,
he'd wig out.

1363
01:57:44,398 --> 01:57:47,985
I knew he'd come out
if he was threatened.

1364
01:57:48,193 --> 01:57:51,655
Who better to do that than me?

1365
01:57:51,864 --> 01:57:53,657
You used me.

1366
01:57:57,494 --> 01:58:01,039
Yeah, I did. I had no choice.

1367
01:58:02,291 --> 01:58:05,794
What did I use that was so terrible?

1368
01:58:06,003 --> 01:58:09,840
I knew you'd do your job. I knew
you'd stand up to Shaughnessy.

1369
01:58:10,048 --> 01:58:12,759
I knew you'd try to win the case.
What's wrong with that?

1370
01:58:12,968 --> 01:58:17,598
- I lost my fucking job!
- Good, you should've left years ago.

1371
01:58:17,806 --> 01:58:21,560
- You always say what's right for me.
- I'm arrogant.

1372
01:58:23,353 --> 01:58:24,855
I'm very...

1373
01:58:26,565 --> 01:58:29,234
...very arrogant.

1374
01:58:39,286 --> 01:58:41,496
- You wanna dance?
- No.

1375
01:58:42,831 --> 01:58:44,875
- Sure?
- Yeah.

1376
01:58:47,377 --> 01:58:50,339
All you have to do is turn around.

1377
01:58:55,469 --> 01:58:57,387
No.

1378
01:58:58,514 --> 01:58:59,848
No.

1379
01:59:09,274 --> 01:59:12,361
I have to see my client.

1380
01:59:54,903 --> 01:59:57,739
- I'd like a minute alone with him.
- You sure?

1381
02:00:10,919 --> 02:00:12,504
You OK?

1382
02:00:16,049 --> 02:00:19,094
My head hurts.

1383
02:00:19,303 --> 02:00:22,598
You don't remember
what just happened?

1384
02:00:25,184 --> 02:00:26,768
No?

1385
02:00:26,977 --> 02:00:29,938
I lo-lost time again.

1386
02:00:31,190 --> 02:00:34,484
Well, I got some good news.

1387
02:00:34,693 --> 02:00:36,612
They've agreed to stop the trial.

1388
02:00:36,820 --> 02:00:41,909
They'll be sending you to a hospital...
to get the help you need.

1389
02:00:43,535 --> 02:00:48,707
There's a very good chance
you can get out someday soon.

1390
02:00:51,418 --> 02:00:53,086
Yeah.

1391
02:00:57,382 --> 02:00:59,676
I c-can't believe it.

1392
02:00:59,885 --> 02:01:04,097
- I d-don't know what to say, Mr Vail.
- That's all right.

1393
02:01:04,306 --> 02:01:09,686
I knew the minute you came into my
cell that everýthing would be OK.

1394
02:01:09,895 --> 02:01:13,357
You s-saved my life.

1395
02:01:20,113 --> 02:01:22,241
I got to go.

1396
02:01:23,659 --> 02:01:28,872
- When will I see you again?
- That's up to the courts now.

1397
02:01:29,957 --> 02:01:34,336
I don't want you to worry.
I'm gonna stay on top of this, OK?

1398
02:01:40,843 --> 02:01:43,178
Thank you.

1399
02:01:43,387 --> 02:01:47,516
- Give me a call if you need to.
- I will.

1400
02:01:50,853 --> 02:01:52,855
- Mr Vail?
- Yeah.

1401
02:01:54,857 --> 02:01:59,319
Will you t-tell Miss Venable I'm sorry?

1402
02:02:00,571 --> 02:02:03,490
Tell her I hope her neck is OK.

1403
02:02:04,783 --> 02:02:06,535
Yeah.

1404
02:02:22,926 --> 02:02:26,513
- What did you just say?
- What?

1405
02:02:27,806 --> 02:02:31,351
You told me you don't remember.
You black out.

1406
02:02:34,354 --> 02:02:36,607
So how do you know about her neck?

1407
02:02:52,080 --> 02:02:55,334
Well, good for you, Marty.

1408
02:02:57,085 --> 02:02:58,795
I was gonna let it go.

1409
02:02:59,004 --> 02:03:02,090
You were looking so happy just now.
I was thinking...

1410
02:03:03,675 --> 02:03:06,053
To tell you the truth,
I'm glad you figured it.

1411
02:03:06,261 --> 02:03:09,640
'Cause I have been dying to tell you.

1412
02:03:09,848 --> 02:03:12,351
I just didn't know
who you'd wanna hear it from.

1413
02:03:12,559 --> 02:03:14,603
Aaron or Roy, Roy or Aaron.

1414
02:03:15,395 --> 02:03:21,693
Well, I'll let you in on a client-
attorney-privilege type of secret.

1415
02:03:21,902 --> 02:03:26,240
It don't matter who you hear it from.
It's the same story.

1416
02:03:30,369 --> 02:03:33,372
I j-j-just...

1417
02:03:33,580 --> 02:03:37,084
had to kill Linda, Mr Vail.

1418
02:03:37,292 --> 02:03:40,796
That cunt just got what she deserved.

1419
02:03:43,215 --> 02:03:47,261
But...cutting up
that son of a bitch Rushman...

1420
02:03:49,096 --> 02:03:52,015
...that was just a fucking work of art.

1421
02:04:00,399 --> 02:04:02,609
You're good. You are really good.

1422
02:04:03,652 --> 02:04:07,531
Yeah, I did get caught, though, didn't l?

1423
02:04:10,617 --> 02:04:14,162
So there never...
there never was a Roy?

1424
02:04:16,081 --> 02:04:22,671
Jesus Christ, Marty. If that's what
you think, I'm disappointed in you.

1425
02:04:24,631 --> 02:04:29,428
There never was an Aaron, counsellor.

1426
02:04:37,561 --> 02:04:40,272
Come on, I thought you had it
figured there at the end.

1427
02:04:40,480 --> 02:04:43,692
The way you put me on the stand
like that, that was brilliant.

1428
02:04:43,901 --> 02:04:47,321
The whole "act-like-a-man" thing.
I knew what you wanted.

1429
02:04:47,529 --> 02:04:50,073
It was like we were dancing, Marty!

1430
02:04:50,282 --> 02:04:52,492
- Guard.
- Don't be like that, Marty.

1431
02:04:53,911 --> 02:04:59,082
We did it, man. We fucking did it.
We're a great team, you and me.

1432
02:04:59,291 --> 02:05:01,418
You think I could've
done this without you?

1433
02:05:01,627 --> 02:05:06,798
You're feeling angry because you
started to care about old Aaron, but...

1434
02:05:08,050 --> 02:05:10,010
...love hurts, Marty. What can I say?

1435
02:05:11,136 --> 02:05:14,515
I'mjust kidding, bud!
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings!

1436
02:05:14,723 --> 02:05:17,267
What else was I supposed to do?!

1437
02:05:17,476 --> 02:05:22,356
You'll thank me down the road, 'cause
this'll toughen you up, Martin Vail!

1438
02:05:22,564 --> 02:05:26,151
You hear me? That's a promise!
