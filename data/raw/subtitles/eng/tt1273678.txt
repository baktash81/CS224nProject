1
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,820
Mom! Jethro's eating my underwear!

3
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:06,160
Mom before she starts
there isn't a shred of evidence

4
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,710
-to support her allegations.
-Gillian your son is a psycho.

5
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:14,550
-He booby-trapped my hair dryer.
-Nice hypothesis but you can't prove it.

6
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,380
-Yeah but l can hurt you.
-Mom! Mom! She needs to be medicated.

7
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,850
-Come on Jethro.
-Come here.

8
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,970
l hate this family. Come here.

9
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,560
Jethro you're getting a time out.

10
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:45,160
Come on guys. Backpack.

11
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,040
-What? lt's in style.
-lt's inappropriate. Go put on some jeans.

12
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,510
And spit out the gum.

13
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,090
So what color do you want to wear today?

14
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,720
Red? Blue? Purple?

15
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,890
Pink Momma pink.

16
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,560
-Farren.
-What? You said jeans.

17
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,610
l meant in your size.

18
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,780
Come on guys. Come on.
We don't want to be late. There you go.

19
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,830
Come on sweetie.

20
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,120
-No!
-Get out!

21
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,300
No fighting.

22
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,930
Allow me.

23
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,440
-Hi.
-Hi.

24
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,440
-Are we still on for dinner?
-l'll be there.

25
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,020
We have an audience.

26
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,940
-Yuck. l'm going to vomit.
-He is such a loser.

27
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,990
l like Bob. He's nice.

28
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:06,160
He's a boring pen importer.
He does the same routine every day.

29
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,160
-He's like a robot.
-That's 'cause he is a robot.

30
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:14,120
A cyborg sent from the future
to destroy humanity. Starting with us.

31
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,800
Well it's been three months.
Happy anniversary.

32
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,470
What is it?

33
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,350
l have to tell you about my job.

34
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,070
This might shock you

35
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:43,990
but you should know everything
before this relationship goes further.

36
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,660
-Don't Bob.
-What?

37
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,200
l'm very happy when l'm with you.

38
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,160
No one has ever made me laugh like you do

39
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,330
and if l were a single woman
l could see a real future for us.

40
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,420
But l'm a package deal.

41
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,920
What do you mean?

42
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,760
My kids are my priority and.. .
How can l put this gently?

43
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,930
-They hate me.
-Yeah.

44
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,350
-l can make them like me.
-See?

45
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,850
You can't make kids like you
not mine or anyone's.

46
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,860
My kids have been through a lot and.. .

47
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:26,200
l don't think we should take the next step
until they warm up to you.

48
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,030
Doesn't your happiness count?

49
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,660
Excuse me.

50
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,790
Sorry l gotta go. Emergency at work.

51
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:43,010
-No ink?
-lt's much bigger.

52
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:46,720
Sorry really.
l will explain everything tomorrow.

53
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,220
Okay. l'll see you tomorrow.

54
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,200
-What took you so long to get here?
-Six minutes.

55
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,910
-You stop for a latte?
-l get it. You're.. .

56
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,330
-What's the expression? Chopping my bust.
-Close enough.

57
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,670
Poldark and a couple other Russkys
just went in the refinery.

58
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:25,590
Then l was right. He's planning something.

59
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,090
Maybe they just want to fill up
their gas tanks for free.

60
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,430
-l couldn't blame them.
-No that man's so crooked

61
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,930
he could eat nails and poop corkscrews.

62
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,560
You're the world's foremost authority
on Poldark.

63
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,970
What do you think he's up to?

64
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,640
lf his mission is to sabotage
the world's oil reserves

65
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:41,810
why would he care about
some two-bit refinery like this one?

66
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:45,110
l'll make sure you get a chance to ask him.

67
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,840
How the heck are you going to get in there?
A jet pack?

68
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,800
lt's in the shop.

69
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,110
Wait for my signal.

70
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:32,780
Yuri.

71
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,990
-What's this?
-C-4.

72
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:40,410
When we are done here l want you
to blow this place to smithereens.

73
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:21,040
Hurry up. l don't have all day.
There is no overtime here.

74
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,400
Bob Ho.

75
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,750
l would love to chat but l gotta go.

76
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,800
-Up there. Go go go go.
-Move it.

77
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,880
-Move.
-Hold it. Stay where you are.

78
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,510
That was fun. A good aerobic workout.

79
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,760
We should do this again sometime.

80
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,640
Okay Poldark let's go.

81
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,600
{\i1}We have suspect in custody.{\i0}

82
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,480
Did you see the look
on Poldark's face man?

83
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,400
Brilliant work Bob. Unbelievable.

84
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:20,410
l really hate to see you go home.
You're the best agent l've ever had.

85
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,040
Hey you know l'm standing right here.

86
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,040
Maybe l can get your government
to loan you to me just a little bit longer.

87
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,960
No. This was my last assignment.
l'm retiring.

88
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:36,050
-Don't tell me because of Gillian.
-l want a normal life. l want to get married.

89
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,340
Oh heck man. Don't get married.

90
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,680
Just find some woman
that you're going to hate in five years

91
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,720
and give her your house.

92
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,480
Keep the watch.
A memento compliments of the ClA.

93
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,400
So Gillian? ls that the woman
that lives next door to your cover house?

94
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,400
-Yeah they've been stepping out.
-l could never give up this life for a woman.

95
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:56,650
We're spies man.

96
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,360
Every little boy wants to be a spy.
lt's the life.

97
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:02,120
All the hours you spend
sitting alone in a little room like this

98
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,540
eating cold take-out food
in the back of a surveillance van

99
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,160
getting shot at all the time

100
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,830
learning how to pee in a bottle
in a moving vehicle.

101
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:13,130
-You're doing the right thing.
-Only problem is that her kids hate me.

102
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:16,590
You the man.

103
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:19,260
Really gonna miss you Ho.
Good luck with those kids.

104
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,930
l've brought down dictators.
How tough can three kids be?

105
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,470
-Come on Ringo come on.
-Here kitty kitty kitty.

106
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,520
-Ringo!
-Don't worry. Come on. Come on.

107
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,690
-Come on. Right here.
-Come on Ringo.

108
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:33,270
-Come on Ringo.
-Ringo.

109
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,610
Hi kids.

110
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,570
l'm sorry about running out last night.

111
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,870
-lt's all right. lt's your job.
-No it was rude.

112
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:48,580
l promise it will never happen again.

113
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,540
Mom what about Ringo?

114
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:57,090
We've tried everything sweetheart.
He'll come down when he's ready.

115
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,590
You want to see
what l've been working on?

116
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,970
Sure.

117
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,310
Ringo Ringo! Come on kitty.
lt's not that far.

118
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,100
Please please please Ringo.

119
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,980
There you go.

120
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,710
-So what do you think?
-Well.. .

121
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,840
lt's a work-in-progress.

122
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,260
Sadly l didn't have any time
to work on it today.

123
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,680
Cat was on the roof
satellite's broken again.

124
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,970
l spent two hours on hold
trying to get a repairman out here

125
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,230
and l can't stop thinking about last night.

126
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:55,690
So are we okay?

127
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,070
l understand.

128
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:02,360
lf a man marries you
he marries all four of you.

129
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,410
Don't forget the pig the cat and the turtle.

130
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,830
So do you really like it?

131
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,410
lt frightens me.

132
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:18,040
Sometimes l think l found
the last honest man left in the world.

133
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,560
l brought you all cookies.

134
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,350
-Yes?
-ls it true? You're going to marry Bob?

135
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,570
-What? Whoa! Calm down.
-You can't do this Gillian.

136
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,190
You're like so far above him.

137
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,240
What she means is he's boring. He's a geek.

138
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,320
He's a very nice man
who treats me very well.

139
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:51,200
-He's a pen importer.
-He's a cyborg.

140
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:55,210
You all don't know him like l do.

141
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:58,380
He's very passionate about the world
and about my art.

142
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,920
He likes to talk about history
science and politics.

143
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,800
l see what you mean about
him not being boring.

144
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:11,970
What you all call boring l call dependable.

145
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:15,390
For once l'd like a man who goes to work
every day at the same time

146
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,640
and who comes home every single night.

147
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:22,360
A man who doesn't lie or cheat
or leave his family the first time some.. .

148
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,950
My happiness counts too.

149
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,420
l hate it when old people have feelings.

150
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,300
We gotta deep-six Bob.

151
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,230
-What's the story here?
-They hit Poldark's prison transport caravan

152
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:04,150
-at the edge of town.
-Tell me he didn't get away.

153
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:07,240
He's as gone as rum cake at an AA meeting.

154
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,780
l'm telling you
this whole thing was a setup.

155
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,570
They knew he was coming.

156
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,120
Are you saying
there's a mole in the agency?

157
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,040
l'm not saying anything except he got away.

158
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,890
Welcome back.

159
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:53,450
Tatiana
you can't imagine what it's like in there.

160
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:58,450
The oppressive darkness and the torture
of empty days stretching for years.

161
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,580
-Prison is hell.
-You were in there for four hours.

162
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,290
Enough tearful reunion.

163
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,340
l need a new batch of the formula
as soon as possible.

164
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:15,100
We'll run another test in two days.

165
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:20,680
l need a change of clothes.
Something current and fashionable.

166
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,310
And something to eat
that does not come with a toy.

167
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:03,060
{\i1}The Sea Hag's made Olive into a zombie.{\i0}

168
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,790
Honey we're getting ready
to carve pumpkins downstairs.

169
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,750
-You want to join us?
-Absolutely!

170
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,010
'Cause l'm a loser and l have no life.

171
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:37,510
Did l mention we're going
to toast the pumpkin seeds?

172
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:41,220
Come on. l want you to join the family.

173
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,180
And l want some privacy.

174
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,440
-Don't get fresh with me.
-l'll use whatever tone of voice

175
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,440
-l want to use with you.
-Farren l want you downstairs.. .

176
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,110
No l'm not going to come downstairs
right now. Get out.

177
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,280
Farren this is my house.
You will listen to me.

178
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,610
You don't own me. Get out.
l said get out Gillian. Get out!

179
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,280
Downstairs in five minutes.

180
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,450
l hate this house. l hate this family. Get out!

181
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,210
{\i1}Me spinach!{\i0}

182
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,550
No she won't hear me. l'm on the roof.

183
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:20,140
lt's like the only place
l can get any privacy in this loony bin.

184
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,350
l can't let Gillian marry this guy.

185
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:27,480
No it's not that.
l mean you're right he is a total drone

186
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,650
but that's not the issue.

187
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,690
What's going to happen
when my dad comes back?

188
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,610
He won't just leave me here alone.
He'll be back.

189
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:39,820
And if she's married what happens then?
l don't know.

190
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,590
Mom lan's feeding Jethro bacon.

191
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,630
-Okay that's just wrong.
-Why is it wrong?

192
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:13,820
-Ho Bob Ho.
-Hey. So how's it going with those kids?

193
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,070
l'm taking Gillian and the children
on a picnic.

194
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:18,110
l'm going to force those kids to like me.

195
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,450
Force them? You know you might as well
try scratching your ear with your elbow.

196
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:26,040
Guess what? Poldark escaped.

197
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:34,130
{\i1}-No longer my problem.
-Yeah l know but we recovered a file.{\i0}

198
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,920
lt seems to be an entry portal to a website.

199
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:40,090
{\i1}We can't crack it.
l thought maybe you could take a look at it.{\i0}

200
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:44,100
Hey if you can figure it out great.
lf you can't no harm no foul.

201
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,890
As a favor to you.
Send it to my home computer.

202
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,520
{\i1}Already did.{\i0}

203
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:56,150
While l'm thinking about it they suspect
there may be a mole at the agency.

204
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,610
{\i1}-They suspect me?
-No.{\i0}

205
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:02,410
You know Glaze thinks
you're the sharpest barb on the wire.

206
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,700
l have no idea what that means.

207
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:07,410
Hey listen man have fun on your picnic.

208
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:11,080
Just shoot me back
when you check out that file. Thanks.

209
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:31,560
Puzzle encryption.
Let's see what you've got.

210
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:49,660
-ls it noon already?
-No. l have bad news.

211
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,540
-My father is in the hospital.
-That's terrible.

212
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,170
He plays senior softball
and he slid into third.

213
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,260
-Now he's having his hip replaced.
-That's terrible.

214
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:05,260
l have to leave the kids
and fly to Denver to take care of Dad.

215
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:09,010
-That's great.
-What are you talking about?

216
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,470
Let me watch the kids.

217
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,810
lt would give us a chance
to get to know each other.

218
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:18,400
No Bob. You? Them? l don't know.

219
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:21,900
My aunt's flying in from San Antonio.
She's very good with the kids.

220
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:25,860
-She was in the military.
-Gillian this could be just what we need.

221
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:28,370
You really think you can handle
that kind of pressure?

222
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,580
The driving the schoolwork
and then there's Halloween.

223
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,210
Getting their costumes
finishing decorating the house?

224
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:37,380
No problem. Halloween is my favorite.

225
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:40,840
You have nothing to worry about.
They will be perfectly safe with me.

226
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,680
lt's not them l'm worried about.

227
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:49,930
-You can't be serious.
-lsn't there any other option?

228
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,020
Foster care? Juvenile hall?

229
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,390
Okay. You'll be fine.

230
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,860
Love you guys.

231
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:03,360
-l'm going to miss you.
-Yeah as proven by this total abandonment.

232
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:07,030
You'll survive. l'll buy you something
from the hospital gift shop.

233
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,700
-Bye.
-Bye. Love you.

234
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,910
-See you later.
-Bye.

235
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:18,540
So is this exciting or what?

236
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:26,050
Well l'll just pack a few things
and we'll go to your house okay?

237
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,230
A Flowbee. l knew he cut his own hair.

238
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,820
Nothing telling in his DVD collection.

239
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:46,740
Standard action movies
mainstream comedies

240
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,660
no sci-fi and nothing above PG-13.

241
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,200
Hey his computer. Let's check it out.

242
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,830
Good idea.
There's got to be some dirt on there.

243
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,170
Fashion Armageddon.

244
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:06,590
l haven't forgotten Colton.
l will look at the file.

245
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,220
But this is important. What is Halloween?

246
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,850
Farren do you realize what this is?

247
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,770
lt's got you all worked up.
Let me guess a Klingon dictionary?

248
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:23,360
You have me confused
with an entirely different class of geek.

249
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,940
Stockholm GBH.

250
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:28,400
Grievous Bodily Harm live in Stockholm.

251
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:31,780
This is one of the rarest bootleg concerts
in the world.

252
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:35,450
-Why does Bob have it?
-Who cares? l'm gonna download it.

253
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:40,330
This is my ticket to Coolsville.

254
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,890
This is what you bring me to wear?

255
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,220
You said you wanted current.

256
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,810
l look like the Fresh Prince of Belarus.

257
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:00,850
Send someone out
to get me something elegant.

258
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,440
What is this program you found?

259
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,610
l went on to download the formula

260
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:08,860
and found the site being accessed
by a third party.

261
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:11,450
lf the United States or China
has the formula

262
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:12,990
they can develop an antibody for it.

263
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:15,490
l'm tracing the lSP
but it's heavily encrypted.

264
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,790
lt will take me a while to track it down.

265
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:20,540
Find whoever downloaded my formula.

266
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,580
-Retrieve it.
-And?

267
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,130
-Kill them.
-Thank you.

268
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,310
-What's up with you?
-l'm gonna kill you.

269
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,390
What? l'm gonna kill you.

270
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,390
Don't hurt me! Don't hurt me!
She's hurting me!

271
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,480
Hey hey hey.

272
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,190
Hey stop!

273
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:50,690
-What's going on here?
-She threw a stink bomb in my room.

274
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,200
What? That's so not true.

275
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:56,240
So what you're saying l threw
a stink bomb in my own room

276
00:24:56,450 --> 00:25:00,040
just to get you in trouble? Sad. So sad.

277
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,830
Hey hey hey.

278
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,170
Farren l'm very disappointed in you.

279
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,460
You two should be in bed by now.

280
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:12,170
Well if we finish our homework in time
Gillian lets us stay up till midnight.

281
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:18,220
She also likes us to watch Adult Swim.
lt's kind of a tradition.

282
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,930
l didn't really think this one through.

283
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,860
Nora let's get ready for bed.

284
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,240
l don't want to go to bed.

285
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,750
Only my mommy can dress me.

286
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:46,500
Nora.

287
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,260
Here l come.

288
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:56,390
Hey! Come back. l'll get you.

289
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,100
Come back!

290
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,600
l got you. No come back!

291
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,440
Nora.

292
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,530
Come on. Nora.

293
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,740
-Only my mommy can dress me.
-Come on Nora.

294
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:19,070
Only my mommy can dress me!

295
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,200
Only mommy can dress me!

296
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,750
You.

297
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:34,130
Can your mommy do that? Sleep.

298
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,410
Get out!

299
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:12,960
-Hello?
-You're alive. That's a good sign.

300
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:17,470
-How are the kids?
-We had a great night. Easy as pie.

301
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:21,090
Really? You're with my kids right?

302
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,350
Bob the other night at dinner

303
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:29,310
you were gonna say something
about your job and l cut you off.

304
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:32,110
You want to tell me now?

305
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,730
lt can wait until you get back.

306
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,280
-l really think this was a good idea.
-l'm sure the worst is behind us.

307
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,220
Just a second.

308
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,580
l got it.

309
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,910
Fire!

310
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,960
Big mistake.

311
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:45,470
Everything will be fine. Oatmeal's ready.

312
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,100
-Shotgun.
-lt's not your day.

313
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,690
You sure your mother
lets you go to school like that?

314
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,030
Duh Bob.

315
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,320
''Duh Bob.' '

316
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:15,380
-Bye.
-Well you guys have a nice day.

317
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,220
-Hi.
-That is so cute.

318
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,760
So what do you do all day?

319
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:29,060
Nothing. l'm four.

320
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,270
-You're full of it.
-Yeah full of it.

321
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,860
l'm telling you l downloaded it yesterday.

322
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,320
Really? 'Cause if you really had
that'd be pretty cool.

323
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,070
-Yeah pretty cool.
-Let's hear it then.

324
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:54,460
You trying to pop our ears?
That's nothing but a bunch of static.

325
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,040
-l don't get it.
-l get it.

326
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:59,130
You're a pathetic little nerd and a liar.
Let's get him.

327
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:02,260
Wedgie!

328
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:05,340
Put me down! Put me down!
Put me down! Put me down!

329
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,300
Okay you asked for it.

330
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:14,060
No! You guys are gonna hear from me
and my lawyer.

331
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,020
You'll pay for this
each and every one of you.

332
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:28,070
So tell me more about Halloween.

333
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:31,790
lt's the best. You get candy.

334
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:36,830
Everyone pretends to be someone else
and nobody knows who you really are.

335
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:40,040
Sounds familiar. Nora.. .

336
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:45,130
So what do you want to be?
A Frankenstein? A zombie?

337
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,930
Sweetie do you want to be a princess?

338
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:51,680
Yes.

339
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,190
Okay princess.

340
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,110
Nora?

341
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:13,200
Not fairy. Princess. Princess.

342
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,750
Princess.

343
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,090
Pink.

344
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,340
Pink.

345
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:46,440
-Princess.
-lt's too big.

346
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:50,610
Too big? Okay.

347
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:06,840
Nora? Nora.

348
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,720
Nora.

349
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,430
Nora.

350
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:22,940
Nora.

351
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,360
Nora!

352
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,660
Nora. l'm sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

353
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,460
Nora!

354
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:07,940
Nora. Please don't wander off again.

355
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,360
l'm sorry Bob.

356
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:13,610
Let's go pay for your costume.

357
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,120
Yo it's Ho.

358
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:24,670
Just hold him till l get there.

359
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:35,890
Can l just say before we begin that
only in the current distressed condition

360
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:38,390
of the American public school system

361
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:42,270
could l be deposited headfirst
into a garbage can

362
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:46,230
and yet l'm the one who winds up
receiving disciplinary action?

363
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:49,270
Who exactly are you?

364
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:52,240
l'm his mother's.. .

365
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,160
-Neighbor.
-Neighbor.

366
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,990
l'm watching them for a few days.

367
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,200
Well this is not the first time
lan has been in trouble.

368
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:03,160
He gets in fights. He lies.

369
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:04,250
Hey l don't lie.

370
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:08,630
You told everyone you invited
Selena Gomez to the spring dance.

371
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,840
Her appearance fee was an obstacle.

372
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,510
You said you spent New Year's Eve
at the Playboy Mansion.

373
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:16,930
Hey pay-per-view high-def.
l felt like l was there.

374
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,810
l'm telling you lying is a dangerous game.

375
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:28,520
Bob you sell pens. What do you.. .

376
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,940
-Oh no. That's them.
-Who?

377
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:33,990
The future felons who
put me in the trash can.

378
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:37,490
Hey geek-boy
we got detention because of you.

379
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:40,490
-Yeah because of you.
-You're gonna pay for that.

380
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:44,000
-Gentlemen we don't want trouble.
-Who's this? Your mom?

381
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:49,250
You wish. He's my bodyguard.
l hired him. You better watch out.

382
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,460
-That true?
-No. He's joking.

383
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:55,050
-l'm their babysitter.
-What are you gonna do?

384
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:58,470
Ask you politely to allow us to pass.

385
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:13,980
How humiliating.
Why didn't you do something?

386
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:17,530
Why did you tell them
l was your bodyguard?

387
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,370
You're right.
l guess it was too big a stretch.

388
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:37,170
Hey. How you doing? l'm lan.

389
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:41,090
lf l told you you had a beautiful body
would you hold it against me?

390
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:48,350
-At least you're not shy.
-l wanted to talk to her in the worst way.

391
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,400
Mission accomplished.

392
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,940
Come here.

393
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:59,780
You look so pretty.

394
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:05,450
Farren l didn't know you did gymnastics.

395
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,370
Why would you?
You don't know anything about me.

396
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:12,790
You come over to hang out with Gillian
and you never even talk to us.

397
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,130
Come on let's go.

398
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,800
The woman's got a point.

399
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:30,390
l don't know who you are sending out
to buy my clothes but l want them killed.

400
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:36,440
-You could go yourself.
-l'm the most wanted man in America.

401
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:40,240
l cannot exactly browse
the racks of JCPenneys.

402
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:44,740
Just give me something that will blend in.
Something extremely American.

403
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:48,000
Sir we are ready to run the test.

404
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,650
Magnificent.

405
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:31,790
She must have plastic in her shoes.
lt will eat any petroleum product.

406
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,920
We're working on that.

407
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:43,760
What happened to the bacteria?

408
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:47,390
They live as long as they feed.
Once the oil is gone they disappear.

409
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:49,470
Just like my Jimmy Choos.

410
00:37:58,650 --> 00:37:59,820
Come in.

411
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:06,570
Listen about today.. .

412
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:09,990
You could have stood up for me you know.
l have to face those guys.

413
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,700
So face them.

414
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:13,960
Unless you want
to spend the rest of your life

415
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,120
with your head in the trash can.

416
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:20,000
Thanks for the advice Bob.
All my problems are solved.

417
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:30,310
They assign this in middle school?

418
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:32,680
No that's my pleasure reading.

419
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,810
You're smart.

420
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:42,400
You have a lot going for you.
Why do you make things up?

421
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:45,530
Girls aren't exactly
impressed by astrophysics.

422
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,740
Given the resources
l could design build and launch a rocket

423
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:53,660
that would accurately circumscribe
an orbit of the moon.

424
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:58,540
But other guys can you know
throw a ball through a hoop.

425
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,510
l don't want you to get in trouble.

426
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:05,670
l'll make you a deal.

427
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,050
lf you try to tell the truth from now on

428
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:10,100
l won't tell your mother about today.

429
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,470
Really?

430
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,560
Dude that's almost cool.

431
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,520
You mean for a guy who sells pens?

432
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:25,150
Come on kids time for bed.

433
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:28,740
Come on one more spoonful.

434
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:57,310
Nora.

435
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:17,120
This one l learned it in China
when l was young.

436
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:06,920
lt's me. l need your help.

437
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:21,940
l had to make up
one heck of a yarn to get all this stuff.

438
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,310
What did you tell them?

439
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,480
Well let's just say if l don't find some
weapons-grade uranium by dawn

440
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:29,530
l'm in trouble.
What do you need all this for?

441
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:31,990
To get the kids ready for school.

442
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,950
Well it's like my mom always used to say
when she was stationed over in East Berlin.

443
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:39,950
She'd say ''Spying is easy.
Parenting is hard.' ' Good luck.

444
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:56,720
Bring it on.

445
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:01,390
Farren you've been in there all morning!
Let me in!

446
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:04,650
Farren let me in.

447
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,400
Farren let me in.

448
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,820
{\i1}Farren you've been in there all morning!
Let me in!{\i0}

449
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:15,070
{\i1}Farren.{\i0}

450
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:16,990
Hey!

451
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,950
l guess it's my turn.

452
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:25,330
{\i1}And Farren please put on a longer skirt.{\i0}

453
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,010
This means war.

454
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:49,650
Nora?

455
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:05,910
Nora.

456
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:09,670
Stay with Bob.

457
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:20,470
Come on Nora.

458
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,460
-Where is he?
-Hiding.

459
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:56,340
He's probably going to trick us
into opening the door.

460
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:58,300
Help me put this away?

461
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:13,070
lan. You know the rules.

462
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:15,780
No soda upstairs.

463
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:17,530
What? How did you.. .

464
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:42,140
Breakfast is served.

465
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:45,100
Wow!

466
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,560
Nora time for bed.

467
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,610
Night-night.

468
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:08,580
lt's a school night. You should be asleep.

469
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:10,660
How'd you find me?

470
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:12,330
Call it a hunch.

471
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:29,850
Why do you call your mother
Gillian instead of Mom?

472
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:31,560
She's not my mom.

473
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,150
What do you mean?

474
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:36,610
My father was married before

475
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:38,730
and my real mom died when l was little.

476
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:40,570
Gillian is just my stepmother.

477
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:43,660
And lan and Nora
are just my half brother and sister.

478
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:46,120
l'm like the freak of the family.

479
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,580
lt must have hurt your feelings when he left.

480
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:51,460
He'll be back for me.

481
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,500
l know he's not
the greatest dad in the world

482
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:57,210
but he loves me
and he's not going to leave me here alone.

483
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:04,470
Anyway

484
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:07,640
you should not climb the roof like this.
lt's not safe.

485
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,020
Please don't tell me l can't come up here.

486
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:12,310
lt's like the only place l can chill.

487
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:15,810
Actually l was going to
offer to build you a railing.

488
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:19,730
Are you trying to bribe me into liking you?

489
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,900
l just want you to be safe.

490
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:29,450
Mind if l chill with you?

491
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,830
lt's a free country.

492
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,380
Look at the star.

493
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:01,690
Good news. We got an address.

494
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:08,910
Good. Take some men.
Get that download back.

495
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,200
Tatiana.

496
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,000
No survivors.

497
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:20,290
Hey boss. You like?

498
00:47:26,590 --> 00:47:27,720
No like?

499
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:38,020
May l make a couple
of fashion suggestions?

500
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:42,820
Women don't like the shirt tucked in.
Mess up your hair.

501
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:47,400
-You know about fashion?
-No but l know women.

502
00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:52,910
Wear it like this.
lt's cool l saw it in a movie.

503
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:57,750
{\i1}What movie? Octopussy? This isn't 1985.{\i0}

504
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:01,040
-l almost forgot.
-What's this?

505
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:04,760
-lggy Pop and David Bowie in Shanghai.
-What?

506
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:08,340
This is only about the hardest concert
to find in the world.

507
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:11,600
l guarantee no one else
in the school district has it.

508
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:15,310
-You downloaded this for me?
-Don't worry l paid for it.

509
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:18,850
-How'd you even know about it?
-Easy. l was there.

510
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:31,870
Bob you're getting too efficient.
We're half an hour early.

511
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:33,450
You're welcome.

512
00:48:35,910 --> 00:48:37,500
Have a great day.

513
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,340
-Hey cool look Aaron.
-Thanks. lt's lan.

514
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,130
Whatever.

515
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:14,950
Have a great day.

516
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:19,870
Look the talk on the roof the other night
doesn't mean we're friends.

517
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,290
God forbid.

518
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:45,440
We're here. There is nobody around.

519
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:50,490
{\i1}l found the computer but the file was
downloaded to an external storage device.{\i0}

520
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:52,450
l can't find that.

521
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:57,870
l think l just figured out who lives here.

522
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,660
{\i1}Agent Ho.{\i0}

523
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:15,510
-Hello.
-You must stop shooting things Antosha.

524
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:19,100
l said it would be bad
if the ClA or Chinese had it.

525
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:23,890
But he's both. Find him but keep him alive.

526
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:27,560
l need to know who else he's shown this to.

527
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:36,660
Listen up. Now. Everyone in here.

528
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:43,040
We must locate Chinese lntelligence agent
Bob Ho.

529
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:49,420
He is very tricky. The best at what he does.
He won't be easy to find.

530
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,130
-Ms. Creel.
-Not now.

531
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:56,010
lmagine you are Chinese highly trained
and you want to disappear.

532
00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:59,010
l see him climbing with
a bunch of skulls on a rope.

533
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:03,310
Okay he's not Conan the Barbarian.
Good try though.

534
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:05,190
No l see him. There.

535
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:11,820
Go. Go!

536
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,950
Don't kill him yet. We need information.

537
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:33,670
Go Bob go! Go Bob go! Go Bob go!

538
00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:36,970
Come here sweetheart. Get back here.

539
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:41,600
Come here!

540
00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:51,440
Let go!

541
00:51:54,490 --> 00:51:57,030
-Get the bad lady Bob.
-Let go!

542
00:51:57,910 --> 00:52:00,070
-Can you hold my turtle?
-Not now.

543
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,130
Yay Bob!

544
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:11,920
That's it.

545
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:13,800
You will pay for that

546
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,840
-little American princess.
-Bob help!

547
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,360
Again again again.

548
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:37,690
Okay.

549
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:46,830
-Why did you pull us out of school?
-Who cares? We're out.

550
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:48,870
Why are you in the front seat anyway?
lt's my day.

551
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
-No it isn't. lt's my day.
-No it's not your day. You're the liar.

552
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:55,250
-No today is my day.
-No today is my day.

553
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,840
-You're a liar.
-No. No. No.

554
00:52:57,970 --> 00:53:00,840
-All right quiet!
-l'm still hungry.

555
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,770
lt doesn't look like
they have chicken tenders here.

556
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,980
Wait inside. l have to make a call.

557
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:27,660
{\i1}-This is Firefly.
-This is Bob Ho. l need help.{\i0}

558
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:33,040
Yeah so l get pretty good grades
at this university.

559
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:36,880
l'm top of the class.
l don't like to brag but you know.

560
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,010
-Bob this is Larry.
-Pleased to meet you sir.

561
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,800
-Let's get some food.
-He goes to the university.

562
00:53:42,930 --> 00:53:45,010
He's a poet. lsn't it cool?

563
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:53,900
lt's rad. lt's awesome. lt's jiggy for shizzy.
lt's the bomb.

564
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:57,270
-Let's go.
-Hey!

565
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:01,490
How embarrassing.

566
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:04,820
You know most people don't like me
when they first meet me.

567
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,330
But Larry did.

568
00:54:08,830 --> 00:54:12,410
l have two words for you Larry. Thirteen.

569
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:31,310
l have to go.

570
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:37,270
All right Nora. Come on.
You two stay at the table.

571
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:42,360
No no no.

572
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,280
l can't go in there.

573
00:54:56,290 --> 00:54:57,790
Boys are pigs.

574
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:03,590
Careful.

575
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:16,850
And the lion jumped on me
and l killed him with my bare hands

576
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:18,650
and l saved the colonel's life.

577
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:20,690
-You're brave.
-Thanks.

578
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:26,700
How about this Bob? The whole restaurant
and the waitress sat Larry here.

579
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:29,780
-lsn't it great?
-lt's like it's fate or something.

580
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:32,120
Really sir we're just goofing around.

581
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:34,910
-Hey Nora. Knock knock.
-Who's there?

582
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:37,710
-lrish stew.
-lrish stew who?

583
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:40,420
lrish stew in the name of the law.

584
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:46,720
Larry was telling me all about
the university. lt sounds great.

585
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:49,800
-l'd be glad to give you a tour sometime.
-When pigs fly.

586
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:51,720
lt's not up to you. You're not my dad.

587
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:55,850
No but l know that your mother
hasn't completely lost her mind.

588
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:57,440
lt's just a tour Bob.

589
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:00,480
lt's not like he's asking me out on a date
or anything.

590
00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:01,770
Are you?

591
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:05,190
No it's just a friendly offer.

592
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,450
Even if it was a date
you still couldn't stop me.

593
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:16,790
-What's your major Larry?
-English Lit.

594
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:19,420
Would you pass the soy sauce?

595
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:23,380
That way l get a background in the classics.

596
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:32,800
-You speak Russian Larry?
-What's going on?

597
00:56:51,990 --> 00:56:55,910
-This is going to be painful.
-You're right about that.

598
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:01,000
Go go go.

599
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:11,130
Maybe you'll write a poem about this.

600
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,980
Goodbye Larry.

601
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:40,000
Fine. He's too old for me.

602
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:44,130
Bob l don't want to be a princess anymore.
l want to be a cyborg.

603
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,670
How did he find us so fast?
lt doesn't make sense.

604
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:50,590
-Bob what's going on?
-Please quiet l'm trying to think.

605
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,010
What do you mean you're trying to think?

606
00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:54,970
-You just threw a man out the window.. .
-Who is he? What is.. .

607
00:57:55,050 --> 00:57:57,390
All right all right fine. Fine.

608
00:57:58,350 --> 00:58:03,150
l am international spy on loan to the ClA
from the Chinese lntelligence Service.

609
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:07,730
Someone wants me dead
and ''Larry'' was a Russian operative okay?

610
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:10,030
Fine. Don't tell us.

611
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:12,910
Cool.

612
00:58:18,330 --> 00:58:20,250
Why would he come alone?

613
00:58:21,910 --> 00:58:23,210
Stay here.

614
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:28,460
-Where are the kids?
-lnside.

615
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:31,590
Nothing else matters
until these kids are safe. Nothing.

616
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:35,140
Of course. Colton set up that safe house
for them like you requested.

617
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:38,810
-Hey got that file on you?
-What file?

618
00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:42,060
The one Colton linked you to
from Poldark's computer your download.

619
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:45,190
l didn't download it.
l never even got it open.

620
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:48,650
Don't BS me Bob. lt's classified material.
l need all copies.

621
00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:50,690
Why would you think l downloaded it?

622
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:53,990
Unless someone told you l had
someone who wanted it back.

623
00:58:54,110 --> 00:58:56,200
Let's not make this thing
harder than it has to be Bob.

624
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:57,950
Give me the file.

625
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:00,620
You're a career officer. Why do this?

626
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:03,410
l want out. Same as you.
We're both leaving for love.

627
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:06,920
Only l love money
and Anton Poldark is match.com. The file.

628
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:12,920
Wait. Take it easy.

629
00:59:19,930 --> 00:59:20,890
Good work.

630
00:59:21,310 --> 00:59:22,270
No.

631
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:31,780
Can l just say you are by far
the coolest guy my mom has ever dated.

632
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:36,570
At least now l know how
that kid Larry found us so fast.

633
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:38,240
-How?
-The watch.

634
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:42,790
Glaze told me to keep the watch.
lt must have a tracking device.

635
00:59:43,870 --> 00:59:49,330
-Wow. You really are a spy.
-Gillian is totally going to freak.

636
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,230
What are you doing?

637
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:17,570
There's iron in these rocks.
lt will hide the signal. Watch please.

638
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:20,820
You realize if l told anyone at school
this story

639
01:00:20,910 --> 01:00:23,660
l'd get detention for a year for lying.

640
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,460
{\i1}-Yes.
-Hey partner. Where're you at?{\i0}

641
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:38,840
-Why do you ask?
-l needed to pick up that file l sent you.

642
01:00:38,970 --> 01:00:41,180
{\i1}You know
the one l wanted you to open for me.{\i0}

643
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,560
{\i1}Bob you there?{\i0}

644
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:49,850
Colton l never thought
you would have sold out to Poldark.

645
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:54,530
Hey that's crazy man. Something's wrong.
We need to get together and talk.

646
01:00:55,530 --> 01:00:59,240
-Nice try.
-Bob? Bob?

647
01:01:06,450 --> 01:01:11,380
-We'll be safe here. l promise.
-This is your plan? Hide out in a hotel?

648
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:15,210
Doesn't look like they have
chicken tenders here either.

649
01:01:31,690 --> 01:01:35,360
This is awesome.
Can we order room service?

650
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,940
-Are you crazy? l'm going home.
-No.

651
01:01:38,530 --> 01:01:41,780
-The only place you're safe is with me.
-Safe with you?

652
01:01:41,910 --> 01:01:45,370
-Everybody's trying to kill you.
-l know. lsn't it cool?

653
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:50,160
Hey Bob if you want to marry my mom
l'll personally write the invitations.

654
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:21,110
Love you Bob.

655
01:02:35,830 --> 01:02:37,460
Be realistic Bob.

656
01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:43,970
{\i1}-Hello.
-Hi Gillian.{\i0}

657
01:02:44,090 --> 01:02:45,800
{\i1}Hi sweetheart.{\i0}

658
01:02:45,930 --> 01:02:48,390
Yeah Grandpa just fell asleep.
l was gonna call you guys.

659
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:51,560
l have to tell you something.

660
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:54,940
l know this is going to hurt you
but l have to tell you.

661
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:57,560
{\i1}-Are you all right?
-l'm fine.{\i0}

662
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,940
{\i1}-lt's about Bob.
-What about him?{\i0}

663
01:03:01,030 --> 01:03:04,610
He's not who you think he is.
He's a spy a Chinese spy.

664
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:08,080
And these terrorists are trying to kill him
and now the ClA's after him too and they.. .

665
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:11,620
Farren l know you don't like Bob
but come on.

666
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:14,290
{\i1}l'd expect this from lan but not from you.{\i0}

667
01:03:14,370 --> 01:03:18,460
What? No it's true. He's going
to get us all killed. Don't you even care?

668
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:21,840
{\i1}Farren this conversation is over.
Put Bob on.{\i0}

669
01:03:29,850 --> 01:03:30,970
Hi Gillian.

670
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:34,350
Bob l am so sorry.
l don't know what's gotten into her.

671
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,400
{\i1}-lt's true.
-What is?{\i0}

672
01:03:40,190 --> 01:03:42,360
Everything she said is all true.

673
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:45,320
Whatever this is it isn't funny.

674
01:03:45,610 --> 01:03:47,240
The kids are safe l promise.

675
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:50,200
l'll give them to you
as soon as you get back.

676
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:54,750
You're either telling me the truth
or l've left my kids with a nut job.

677
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:59,330
Either way you should come and get them.

678
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:21,520
So you got any other cool spy stuff
besides the watch?

679
01:04:28,450 --> 01:04:31,580
Don't touch. lt's very sharp.

680
01:04:32,450 --> 01:04:34,240
Cool. What else?

681
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:46,420
Cool.

682
01:05:02,770 --> 01:05:04,270
Sorry mister.

683
01:05:06,150 --> 01:05:07,740
Airport. Step on it.

684
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:32,890
-Bob? Are you awake?
-Are you kidding?

685
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:38,520
-Does he always snore like that?
-Can't you hear him next door?

686
01:05:38,890 --> 01:05:41,310
l always thought it was the pig.

687
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:47,400
lt's over with you and Gillian isn't it?

688
01:05:49,530 --> 01:05:51,410
Yes Farren it's over.

689
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:56,740
-You win.
-Then why don't l feel like l won?

690
01:05:57,490 --> 01:06:01,040
lf you really loved her
you wouldn't give up this easily.

691
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:07,130
lt's because l love her and the three of you
that l have to walk away.

692
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:10,420
lt's more important that you're safe.

693
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:15,640
l thought l could put my other life
behind me but l can't.

694
01:06:16,510 --> 01:06:20,180
Be glad.
You're lucky you're not joining this family.

695
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:27,650
You've no idea what it's like to live in
a place where you totally don't belong.

696
01:06:27,730 --> 01:06:30,820
Don't be so sure. l was an orphan.

697
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:36,240
l was raised in a group home.
l never knew my parents but l had a family.

698
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:40,160
l had dozens of brothers and sisters there.

699
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:44,670
And l wasn't related to any of them
but l loved them all.

700
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:49,840
Family isn't whose blood you carry.

701
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:53,840
lt's who you love and who loves you.

702
01:07:03,730 --> 01:07:05,190
-Gillian!
-Mom!

703
01:07:12,110 --> 01:07:16,030
Gillian l'm really sorry about everything.

704
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:25,870
Tell me the truth. Are you really a spy?

705
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:32,170
Yes l am. l was going to tell you at dinner
but you stopped me.

706
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:36,890
l don't care. You put my children in danger.

707
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:39,350
Just go.

708
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:49,900
Bob when are we going to see you again?

709
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:53,570
You're not.

710
01:08:03,870 --> 01:08:08,420
Please don't go away.
Who's gonna sing me China songs?

711
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:22,010
-You'll be safe. l promise.
-Stay away from my children.

712
01:09:11,610 --> 01:09:15,400
{\i1}Dear Mom l am very sorry
but l cannot stay here.{\i0}

713
01:09:15,530 --> 01:09:18,700
{\i1}My destiny is to be a spy like Bob.{\i0}

714
01:09:23,530 --> 01:09:28,540
{\i1}l am going with him.
Best wishes your son lan.{\i0}

715
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:13,920
Ho's signal just popped back up.
We got him.

716
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:17,630
Let's roll.

717
01:10:42,570 --> 01:10:45,450
Bob! Bob!

718
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:48,580
-lan.
-You left your watch.

719
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:51,250
What are you doing here? Let's go.

720
01:10:52,410 --> 01:10:54,880
What do you mean? We just got here.

721
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:10,180
Bob Ho. What a coincidence. Tie them up.

722
01:11:17,650 --> 01:11:20,400
-What are you doing here lan?
-l'm coming with you.

723
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:21,940
l want to be a spy too.

724
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:26,780
ls this the bad guy?
l thought he'd be better dressed.

725
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:32,250
-How did you find me?
-l found one of your tracking devices

726
01:11:32,330 --> 01:11:34,960
and put it in your pocket
when l hugged you goodbye.

727
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:37,210
-l'm impressed.
-Thanks.

728
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:40,840
-Can we go back to business?
-Would it help to mention l'm retired?

729
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:43,220
Retired men don't download secrets.

730
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:46,090
-l never downloaded anything.
-He's lying.

731
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:50,310
Who are you going to believe?
Me or the traitor?

732
01:11:50,970 --> 01:11:54,310
Someone has been a very naughty boy.

733
01:11:55,230 --> 01:11:59,060
He's got cameras and microphones
mounted all over the place.

734
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:02,320
Good plan filming us together.

735
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:06,110
-How could you turn against your country?
-lt's simple.

736
01:12:06,910 --> 01:12:08,700
l'm gonna be a billionaire.

737
01:12:08,780 --> 01:12:13,500
That file that you didn't download?
lt's a formula for a Growth Bacteria Hybrid.

738
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:17,540
This stuff literally eats oil.
Can you imagine?

739
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:21,920
Overnight
all the world's oil supplies go poof.

740
01:12:22,050 --> 01:12:25,720
All except for Russia's.
lt'll be priceless right comrade?

741
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:28,340
How did you get Colt to go along with you?

742
01:12:28,430 --> 01:12:31,180
Colt? That hillbilly's not part of this.

743
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:32,930
He doesn't know what goes on
in the real world.

744
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:35,020
He still thinks wrestling is real.

745
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:37,850
Let the boy go.
He has nothing to do with this.

746
01:12:37,940 --> 01:12:41,520
Mr. Chit-Chat just laid out our whole plan.

747
01:12:45,650 --> 01:12:47,740
We cannot let him go.

748
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:52,080
-He will tell.
-Trust me no one would believe him.

749
01:12:52,700 --> 01:12:54,540
He's right about that.

750
01:12:56,790 --> 01:13:00,500
Hey boss. Look at what l found
sneaking around outside.

751
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:03,590
-Farren?
-Hi everybody.

752
01:13:04,340 --> 01:13:06,340
Please have a seat.

753
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:09,300
This can't be happening.

754
01:13:10,590 --> 01:13:15,100
Poldark let the children go
and l will find this GBH file for you.

755
01:13:15,470 --> 01:13:18,560
GBH? Like Stockholm GBH?

756
01:13:19,190 --> 01:13:22,400
-How do you know that?
-No freaking way.

757
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:25,440
You're telling me all of this is
because he downloaded a bootleg concert?

758
01:13:25,570 --> 01:13:27,030
You did what?

759
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:29,950
You downloaded it?

760
01:13:30,070 --> 01:13:32,990
Wow these companies take piracy
way too seriously.

761
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:36,250
You were messing with my computer?
That's private.

762
01:13:36,330 --> 01:13:38,210
l just wanted to seem cool.

763
01:13:38,330 --> 01:13:41,000
You don't need to. You are cool.

764
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:45,300
-You're one of the coolest kids l know.
-Really? Thanks.

765
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:48,920
Hey over here. Man with a gun.

766
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:52,550
Wait a minute.
l am one of the only kids you know.

767
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:57,220
-Where is the file?
-lt's on my iPod on my desk at home.

768
01:13:58,270 --> 01:14:03,360
Now see you want to be a spy.
Never tell the truth to the bad guy.

769
01:14:03,810 --> 01:14:05,860
Sorry l'm new at this.

770
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:10,490
Tatiana take some men to the kid's house
and find the iPod.

771
01:14:11,410 --> 01:14:13,450
What if the family is home?

772
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:17,870
Ever since you dyed your hair blonde.. .
Kill them.

773
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,540
-No don't!
-Go bring me that iPod.

774
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,460
Come on go. Go.

775
01:14:36,470 --> 01:14:38,680
Now as for you.. .

776
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:13,090
Awesome!

777
01:15:28,570 --> 01:15:30,150
Farren let's go.

778
01:15:31,570 --> 01:15:35,200
-l call dibs on the front.
-Then l pick the radio station.

779
01:15:38,830 --> 01:15:40,200
Okay. Ready?

780
01:15:42,290 --> 01:15:43,750
Okay hold on.

781
01:15:45,580 --> 01:15:47,750
-Hello?
-Gillian listen to me.

782
01:15:48,590 --> 01:15:49,920
Goodbye Bob.

783
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:00,890
Gillian wait. Don't hang up.

784
01:16:04,430 --> 01:16:07,440
Hang on.
We've got to get there before they do.

785
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:16,950
ls there anyone at the agency
you can still trust? Someone you can call?

786
01:16:17,070 --> 01:16:20,620
Sure but they tore out my cameras.
l have no proof of anything.

787
01:16:20,740 --> 01:16:25,830
Except that as it happens l recorded
that entire conversation on my cell phone.

788
01:16:27,790 --> 01:16:29,290
Way to go dork.

789
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:36,630
Colt.. . Just listen.
l'm going to play you something.

790
01:16:38,470 --> 01:16:42,720
{\i1}That file that you didn't download?
lt's a formula for a Growth Bacteria Hybrid.{\i0}

791
01:16:42,810 --> 01:16:45,140
{\i1}This stuff literally eats oil.{\i0}

792
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:50,940
What is this?

793
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:53,360
-lt's Halloween.
-lt's Halloween.

794
01:17:02,950 --> 01:17:05,120
-Happy Halloween.
-Bob!

795
01:17:08,830 --> 01:17:11,380
What are you all doing?
l thought you were upstairs.

796
01:17:11,790 --> 01:17:14,130
-Everybody inside.
-Bob we need to talk.

797
01:17:14,210 --> 01:17:17,220
Mom this isn't a joke. Do whatever he says.

798
01:17:18,340 --> 01:17:19,680
-Okay.
-Come on.

799
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:22,300
-Get your iPod.
-His iPod?

800
01:17:22,390 --> 01:17:24,470
-l demand an explanation.
-They're coming.

801
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:25,970
-Who?
-The Russians.

802
01:17:26,060 --> 01:17:27,020
Russians?

803
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:46,080
l saw them outside. They're coming.

804
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:48,660
-Russians?
-Yes Gillian Russians.

805
01:17:48,750 --> 01:17:49,830
Let's try and keep up.

806
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:56,710
lt's too late. Everybody upstairs.
Understand me?

807
01:17:57,970 --> 01:17:59,300
Stay there.

808
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:04,510
Where's my stuff?

809
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:07,180
-Here take some of this stuff.
-What is all this?

810
01:18:07,270 --> 01:18:08,560
Protection.

811
01:18:10,390 --> 01:18:13,360
Why do you have a lighter?
l don't want you playing with fire.

812
01:18:21,410 --> 01:18:23,870
Okay maybe just this once. Let's go.

813
01:18:23,950 --> 01:18:25,240
Trick or treat.

814
01:18:54,810 --> 01:18:58,230
Hurry. Close it. Close it quick. Okay.

815
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,420
-l forgot Chuckle.
-Nora! Nora!

816
01:19:20,460 --> 01:19:21,970
What are you supposed to be?

817
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:26,260
A cyborg
sent from the future to blast you away.

818
01:19:34,980 --> 01:19:36,940
Mommy that man can fly.

819
01:20:02,210 --> 01:20:05,880
l can't believe you did this to my family
endangered my kids.

820
01:20:06,010 --> 01:20:08,350
l didn't mean to. l love your kids.

821
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:11,010
l want to marry you all four of you.

822
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,180
And l wanted to marry you.

823
01:20:13,310 --> 01:20:15,940
But our wedding gifts would have
to be opened by the bomb squad.

824
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:18,980
All right Ho. Enough games.

825
01:20:27,070 --> 01:20:30,950
l finally found a normal guy l thought
someone who likes to.. .

826
01:20:32,740 --> 01:20:34,910
Can we talk about this later?

827
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:58,020
-He switched belts.
-Get him.

828
01:21:08,490 --> 01:21:10,450
Give me the iPod kid.

829
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:18,830
-Come on let's TP the little geek's house.
-Yeah TP.

830
01:21:30,550 --> 01:21:31,850
Hey guys.

831
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:34,890
Gotta go.

832
01:21:35,430 --> 01:21:37,640
Maybe we should just stick
to stealing candy from little kids.

833
01:21:37,770 --> 01:21:39,600
Yeah real little kids.

834
01:21:45,110 --> 01:21:48,950
-This is going to be fun.
-Hey Larry. Knock knock.

835
01:21:50,990 --> 01:21:51,950
Yes!

836
01:22:09,630 --> 01:22:12,680
Come on guys get in the room
and lock the door. Hurry. Lock it.

837
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:36,120
lrish stew in the name of the law.

838
01:22:37,490 --> 01:22:40,160
Sorry your retirement was so short Bob.

839
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,000
-You can kill me. Let the family go.

This young man might make
a heck of a spy someday.

855
01:24:04,750 --> 01:24:07,920
How quickly can you give me
orange jumpsuit?

856

Wait.

867
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:05,600
l know he lied but he did it to protect us.

868
01:25:05,730 --> 01:25:09,610
This whole time all he ever wanted to do
was protect us Mom.

869
01:25:11,230 --> 01:25:12,610
And Mom

870
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:21,070

Never.

872
01:25:23,620 --> 01:25:26,370
l never thought l'd say this

873
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:28,580
but l agree with Farren.

874
01:25:33,250 --> 01:25:35,340
l suppose you have something to say too.

875
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:37,840
l want Bob to be my daddy.

876
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:55,400
Do you Gillian take Bob

My name really isn't Bob.

882

No that man's so crooked

888
01:27:10,430 --> 01:27:12,310
Maybe he just wanted
to fill up his gas tanks for free.

889
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:13,400
l can't blame him.

890
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:17,110
