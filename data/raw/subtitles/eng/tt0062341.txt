10
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,140
This is why I called you, Tarzan.

11
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,540
This is what I wanted you to see.

12
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,690
Ugly looking thing.

13
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,210
Ugly and terrifying.

14
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,290
Those claws are poisonous.

15
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:47,130
It is the symbol of Barcuna.

16
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:53,660
Barcuna leads a deadly cult dedicated
to the killer instinct of the jaguar.

17
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:58,030
This killer cult was once destroyed
3 centuries ago.

18
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,740
But now this terrible thing has returned
with all its monstrous effects.

19
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:09,940
The first signs were found in the jungle
beyond Marakeet and Caliba.

20
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,320
And now it's growing.

21
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:16,730
A lightning circle of death
and destruction.

22
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,790
Barcuna marches through the jungle
attacking and burning every village,

23
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:28,300
and with each attack his power grows
with new recruits for his cult.

24
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:33,040
Afterwards only a few dead are found.

25
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,740
The rest are taken as slaves.

26
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:40,100
Where he takes these people and why
he wants to enslave them, we do not know.

27
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:45,370
Investigators we have sent into the area
have never returned.

28
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,760
You are the only man I know,
who can track down this terror.

29
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,560
The one man who can find Barcuna
and crush him.

30
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:07,160
Come, old friend.
Let's discuss it further as we walk.

31
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,320
Hello, Cheetah.

32
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:27,850
Hey, you put on some weight.

33
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,930
You're enjoying the treatment here.

34
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,740
He has become our number one attraction.

35
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,020
-- The children love him.
-- Glad to see you, too.

36
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:39,690
We can never thank you enough for
donating him and the other animals.

37
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,970
Good, Cheetah.

38
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,440
Thank you.

39
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:48,420
Come. You have more old friends to visit.

40
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,610
Jungle tribes are difficult to enslave,
Professor.

41
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,960
How does this Barcuna keep a hold on them?

42
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,590
By preying on their primitive beliefs.

43
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:06,440
Yes, Tarzan. Here we are, surrounded
by the fruits of man's progress.

44
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:11,380
A modern civilization capable
of sending men out into space.

45
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:17,320
And yet, out there in the jungle people
still live as their ancestors did.

46
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:19,410
Say, Professor!

47
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,200
-- There's Baron!
-- Yes.

48
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:28,440
Tarzan, I leave you with your friends
for a while.

49
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,250
I know how much they mean to you.

50
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,410
All right, Professor. I won't be long.

51
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,970
Hey, Baron.

52
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,220
Baron! Don't you recognize your old pal?

53
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,380
Easy, boy. Yeah.

54
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,690
You see, Cheetah?

55
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,070
Baron!

56
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,050
Give us a little more speed, Pepe.

57
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:03,040
Yes, sir, captain Sam.

58
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,680
When you get to those sand posts,
stay on the right side of them.

59
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:14,080
The dock is just around the bank. We'll
tie up there and let the motor cool off.

60
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,530
Don't rush me.

61
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,820
I didn't say anything.

62
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,160
Yeah, but I know what you're thinking.

63
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:29,150
I knock 3 kings, 3 jacks,

64
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,780
7, 8, 9 hearts, and I go down with 9.

65
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:35,320
Oh, let me see...

66
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,420
Three 5s, three aces,

67
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:43,450
a king, a jack, a 10 of hearts,

68
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,120
and I've got 2!

69
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:47,510
2?

70
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,680
That's right. I win 7 points.

71
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,180
Deal the cards.

72
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,690
-- You didn't mark to score.
-- "You didn't mark to score?"

73
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,260
What's the matter?
You think I'd cheat a little kid?

74
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:07,080
Well, every time you win, you mark
the score, and every time I win,
you give excuses.

75
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,300
All right, all right.

76
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:15,580
Now satisfied? Now, deal the cards,
you juvenile delinquent!

77
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,700
Come on, come on, deal.

78
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:20,410
Uh-uh, uh-uh, keep your hands
where I can see them.

79
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:24,490
What's the matter?
You think I'd cheat my old captain?

80
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:34,650
Now, how many times have I told you, huh?

81
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:38,540
This is a captain's hat.
It belongs on the captain's head.

82
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:39,880
Do you understand?

83
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,000
You promised him his own cap.

84
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,340
Not until he gets a promotion.

85
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,630
You also promised him a promotion.

86
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:49,040
That's when he gets his own cap.
Now, come on. Let's play cards.

87
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:26,330
All right, all right, misdeal.

88
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,910
That kibitz is on my hand.

89
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,820
Boy, oh boy. That's life for you.

90
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,870
Work my fingers to the bone,
and what do I end up with?

91
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:40,260
A 10 year old card shop and a fugitive
from Bana Mambeli.

92
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:45,570
Hey, let's forget the game.
I'm sure the motor's cooled off by now.

93
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:49,000
Hey, wait a minute. I'm beating you.

94
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:51,150
Hey, now, when you're gonna learn, huh?

95
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:54,670
What's more important, a little card game
or business? Now what?

96
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,950
Come on, you put out the fire,
and I'll get the boat ready to...

97
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,840
Pepe?

98
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,320
Pepe... Pepe, get in the boat.

99
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:10,100
-- What is it, captain Sam?
-- Nice and easy, now.

100
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:12,290
Had natural bad view.

101
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:45,420
Stop! You! No move!

102
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,080
Go on! Shoot! Kill!

103
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:52,290
I know it's a gun,
and I know it can kill.

104
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,530
-- Who are you?
-- I'm called Tarzan.

105
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,690
Yeah, well, I'm captain Sam Bishop.

106
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,490
This is my first mate, Pepe.

107
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,090
I saw your boat from up in the trees,
Captain.

108
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,510
I heard the shots and I got here
as quick as I could.

109
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,090
It's a good thing you did. His gun jammed.

110
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,850
Oh, he-he. It can happen to anybody.

111
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,520
Captain, If I were you, I'd take the boy
and go back down river.

112
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,540
Oh, I can't do that.

113
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,650
It'll be dangerous for you to go further.

114
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,420
Oh, me and Pepe have been to some tight
places before.

115
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,650
See, mister, that boat there is mine, and

116
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,550
we're delivering some medical supplies
to a doctor up in Caliba.

117
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:32,490
I'm getting paid $200 for the job,
and for $200, mister,

118
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:34,800
I don't go back for anything.

119
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,000
Captain, if you don't mind, I'd like
to go up river with you.

120
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:45,410
I'm going in that direction,
and I might be of some help,
if you have any more trouble.

121
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,440
Okay.

122
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:51,480
To show you that captain Sam Bishop
is a man who shows appreciation...

123
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,610
...for you there's no charge.

124
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,550
Captain Bishop! A lion!

125
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:46,760
It's all right.

126
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,340
His name's Baron. He's my friend.

127
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,860
He is your friend?
I'd hate to meet your enemy!

128
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,480
Oh, Baron won't bother anyone
as long as I'm around.

129
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:58,480
You mean, he travels with you? On my boat?

130
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,940
He'll be of no trouble. You have my word.

131
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:03,160
All right, your word. What about his?

132
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:07,840
Okay, okay. Don't be so...
I take your word, too.

133
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,690
But he stays tied up in the cabin, okay?

134
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,580
All right, captain.

135
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,860
I don't get it. You mean,
you travel with a chimp and a lion?

136
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,610
I have my reasons.

137
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,170
Chief Barcuna, I have news
from the great city.

138
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:06,830
The professor in the city
has been destroyed.

139
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,840
But there was another man,
a man from Africa.

140
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:15,560
He is now moving through the jungle,
looking for you.

141
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:18,100
Let him come.

142
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:44,450
Wow! I think I can hunt them
by a mile!

143
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:47,260
Aim is just as important as distance, Pepe.

144
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,380
But you go ahead and practice a while.

145
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,870
All right, Pepe, play time's over.
Your turn behind the wheel.

146
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,200
Be careful with those mud banks, okay?

147
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,200
Keep on the right.

148
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:16,350
That's a nice pussy.
I'm your friend, pussy.

149
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,250
Pussy, pussy, pussy...

150
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,810
Hey, are you sure you got him tied up?

151
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,850
I'm sure, but I'll check.

152
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,300
Are you gonna be staying in Caliba,
Tarzan?

153
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:43,860
No, I'll be going deeper into the jungle,
captain. Into the Marakeet country.

154
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,380
Marakeet?

155
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,000
Pretty rough country up there.

156
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:50,820
Now, why would you be going way up there?

157
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,970
You haven't heard some talks about
some hidden treasure, have you?

158
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:58,260
No treasure. Just something I have to do
for an old friend.

159
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,620
Oh.

160
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:04,690
Pepe! Keep in the middle of the river,
away from those mud banks!

161
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:02,640
You know the penalty for escaping.

162
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,120
-- Take him to the pit!
-- No!

163
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,980
How long has the boy been with you,
captain?

164
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,690
Oh, a couple of years.

165
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:55,300
What happened to his parents?

166
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:56,960
He's an orphan.

167
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,120
Well, he must have somebody.

168
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,730
As a matter of fact,
the boy is a Marakeet.

169
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:06,170
Those nice people beat him with the sticks
and chased him out of their village.

170
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:10,080
It seems that they think that an orphan
brings bad magic.

171
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:13,120
I found him wandering around
the river banks. Been with me ever since.

172
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:15,860
Don't you think he'd be better off
at the mission, captain?

173
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:18,620
Now, what's a mission gonna do for him?

174
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:21,550
Proper care. Peace and upbringing.

175
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:25,010
Peace and upbringing?
What kind of talk is that?

176
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,500
You're not one of those social workers,
are you?

177
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:31,910
Now, look. That kid has plenty
of fresh air, a good place to sleep,
and 3 meals a day.

178
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,490
Now, what else does a kid need?

179
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:36,160
Nothing, but I've just noticed that
the boy is very bright.

180
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:38,030
At the mission he'd get a good education.

181
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,090
Education? Look, I've been teaching him
everything I know.

182
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:42,520
All right.

183
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,980
But I still think you worry
about him a little.

184
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:48,660
Me worry about him? What for?
He's not my kid.

185
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,930
Now, where's my cap?

186
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,330
Now, how many times do I have
to tell you, huh?

187
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:09,730
You keep your hairy paws off of my cap.

188
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:13,310
Now, here. Swab the deck.
Everybody works on my boat.

189
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,690
We'll find a spot up the river
we can spend the night.

190
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:37,890
I think it'd be best if we travel
through the night, captain.

191
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,240
Those medical supplies are marked "urgent".

192
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:41,970
Yeah, I guess you're right.

193
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:45,700
We'll have to stop for an hour or so,
and give the motor a chance to cool.

194
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,480
This old boat ain't as young
as it used to be.

195
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:51,100
Neither are you, captain Sam.

196
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,080
Hear me!

197
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:22,460
I am Barcuna!

198
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:27,580
I am the one ruler of all the jungle!

199
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:33,170
Barcuna's blood is the blood of the jaguar.

200
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:37,980
I have the power to destroy my enemies.

201
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:45,060
I, Barcuna, have cursed the people
of Marakeet, and they will all die.

202
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,670
Those who defy me face death.

203
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,570
Here you go, Cheetah.

204
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,520
Now, that's where you've made
your big mistake of the day.

205
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,750
I take your queen of hearts,

206
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:43,580
and I give you 9 of spades.

207
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:47,320
And I take your 9 of spades, and I...

208
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:50,540
Captain, what's the name
of this game again?

209
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,760
Come on, you know the name
of the game -- "gin".

210
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:55,870
Well, that's what I've got -- "gin".

211
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:57,280
Gin?

212
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:01,530
Four 9-s, three 6-s, and three jacks.

213
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,460
I'm stuck with 7 points.

214
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:07,330
What's the matter, kid? Don't you trust me?

215
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,970
Sure, but sometimes you don't count
so good.

216
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:13,680
Where did you learn how to talk like that,
"sometimes you don't count so good"?

217
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,040
It's "sometimes you don't count so well."

218
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:19,440
Okay, but I want to see what you've got
anyways.

219
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:24,020
7? You've got 37!

220
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:26,900
Oh, come on. How could I have 37? I...

221
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,030
I...

222
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,860
I thought that's queen, match the king.

223
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,140
A diamond and a club?

224
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,970
Don't be so smart, anyone can make
a little simple mistake.

225
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:45,170
Captain...

226
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:47,770
You're not mad at me, are you?

227
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,840
No, I'm not mad at you.

228
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:52,840
You're a good kid.

229
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:57,130
But who likes kids?
Come on, deal the cards.

230
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:02,170
Let's deal from the top of the deck, huh?

231
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:18,440
They came...

232
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,540
attacked the village...

233
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,560
Barcuna...

234
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:25,920
drove my people out.

235
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:29,260
Slaves...

236
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,800
...digging holes in mountain...

237
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:36,500
to take out shiny stones...

238
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,000
Slaves...

239
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,860
White people...

240
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:08,690
I'll bury him.

241
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:21,420
Now, what was that he said about
shiny stones?

242
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,190
I bet he was talking about diamonds.

243
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:27,450
Yes, sir. Pepe, I had that Tarzan
figured out, all right?

244
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,530
I know he's after something.

245
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:31,370
Well, kid.

246
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,250
The day Tarzan finds those stones,

247
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:36,830
we'll be standing there right
alongside of him for our share.

248
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,980
After all, we're not charging him
for the trip, are we?

249
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,440
Come on, kid.

250
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:18,250
Too bad people don't behave like that.

251
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,360
Well, Tarzan, we'll be there in a couple
of hours.

252
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:29,720
Caliba is just up there, on those hills.

253
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:34,570
The approach is around the bend
of the river, about two miles up.

254
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,670
Okay, Peringa. Bye-bye.

255
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:16,680
Uhu.

256
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,730
Sit down, Panyo.

257
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,850
Now...

258
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:42,590
Stop it! Stop it!

259
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:43,890
Leave them alone!

260
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:57,060
Tell your people that the jungle
belongs to Barcuna.

261
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:40,880
Hey, captain! Look at that smoke!

262
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,960
Oh, my gosh! It's Caliba!

263
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,850
I wonder if the doctor's all right.

264
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:53,180
I'll meet you there.

265
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,670
Full speed ahead, Pepe!

266
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,340
You're doctor Phillips?

267
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:04,610
-- You come from Caliba?
-- Yes.

268
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:06,860
We saw the smoke from the boat.

269
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:08,240
We?

270
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:10,430
Captain Bishop's boat.

271
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,050
You were traveling with captain Bishop?

272
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,640
Yes.

273
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:18,110
What happened back there?

274
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,530
It was horrible. They came so suddently,
they...

275
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:22,660
They herded the people off like animals.

276
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:24,240
Do you know who they are?

277
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:27,740
One of the men, the leader,
called himself Barcuna.

278
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:30,720
Let me take you back to the boat.

279
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:04,840
Why don't we go into jungle
and find Tarzan?

280
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:09,480
No, we'll wait right here.

281
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:11,530
But what if he is in trouble?

282
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:14,830
Oh, look, Pepe. I'm trying to teach you
all the angles.

283
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:17,920
Don't you see? We go into the jungle
that way...

284
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:20,770
Tarzan sneaks back this way,
and he steals the boat.

285
00:45:20,930 --> 00:45:22,960
But why would he do a thing like that?

286
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,410
The diamonds, kid. The diamonds.

287
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,760
He doesn't want us around, you get it?

288
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:29,390
O-oh.

289
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,040
Now, here's the plan.

290
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:33,550
As soon as Tarzan comes back,
we go find the doc,

291
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:36,350
deliver the medical supplies,
and collect our $200.

292
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:40,770
And I tell Tarzan that we're gonna visit
your sick uncle at Marakeet.

293
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:43,600
And we invite him to come along with us,
free of charge,

294
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:45,920
then we can keep an eye on him
all the time.

295
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,150
Hey...

296
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:49,360
What's an uncle?

297
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,620
What's an uncle? Let me see...

298
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,610
Did your father ever have a brother?

299
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,820
I don't think so.

300
00:45:55,850 --> 00:45:58,410
Well, if he had a brother,
that would be your uncle.

301
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:01,680
Well, I don't have an uncle,
and that would be lying to Tarzan.

302
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:06,170
Ah. Pepe, we're not lying to Tarzan,
we're just telling him part of the truth.

303
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:08,090
What part is the truth?

304
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:10,120
You had a father, didn't you?

305
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:12,510
Yeah.

306
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,510
See what I mean?

307
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:18,140
Now, we're gonna stay right here and wait
for Tarzan, if it takes them up to sundays.

308
00:46:18,290 --> 00:46:20,580
He ain't get to those diamonds before us.

309
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:23,120
Captain Sam...

310
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,080
Oh, there you are.

311
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:33,340
Pepe, get the motor started.

312
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:41,370
Eh, doctor Phillips, Tarzan.
We were just talking about you.

313
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:42,450
I'm glad you waited.

314
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:44,660
Oh, I ain't the kind of guy that runs out
of a friend.

315
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:47,070
You might have run into some trouble,
and needed my help.

316
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:48,880
Doc, I'm glad to see you're okay.

317
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:52,670
No, thanks to you. You'd do a week ago.
Where are my supplies?

318
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:56,770
Ah, you don't have to worry.
Safe and sound aboard my boat.

319
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:59,400
All right, Pepe. Get ready to shove off.

320
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:09,210
Your boat looks like Noah's Ark!

321
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:15,200
One of Tarzan's pets.
He takes a little getting used to.

322
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,430
He won't bother you, doctor.
You can go on board.

323
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:24,170
-- What happened in Caliba?
-- It was burnt to the ground.

324
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,850
Why don't you take Dr. Phillips
and go back to Masalva?

325
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:28,760
I'm not going to Masalva.

326
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,210
I heard about the epidemic in Marakeet,
that's why I sent for the vaccine.

327
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:34,420
You saw what happened at Caliba?

328
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:36,400
It's too dangerous.

329
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,400
Because I'm a woman?

330
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:40,670
It's not safe for a man or a woman.

331
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,420
-- But you're going up there, aren't you?
-- Yes, I'm going.

332
00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:46,830
I want you to take the boy and
doctor Phillips, and go back to Masalva.

333
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:48,680
I'll take the medicine with me.

334
00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:49,870
Then what?

335
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:53,650
I suppose you diagnose for diseases,
give the injections, and then

336
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:55,820
arrange the stop of spreading of it.

337
00:47:56,050 --> 00:47:58,650
Oh, no. I'm going to Marakeet.

338
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:01,730
Look, doctor. It just isn't safe.

339
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,970
But you're a big girl, so you do
what you want.

340
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:07,660
I didn't come to this jungle to be safe.

341
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:10,640
You can argue forever, but I'm going
to Marakeet.

342
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:14,780
And you, captain Bishop,
are taking me there.

343
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:23,130
Now, what you're gonna do with a woman
like that?

344
00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:25,020
You could refuse to take her.

345
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,960
Oh, I couldn't do that, Tarzan.
It's kinda like a mission of mercy.

346
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,890
And if it's dangerous as you say it is,
you can't either. Stick with us.

347
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:35,620
You know, lend a hand, in case
anything happens.

348
00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:39,400
Yes, captain.

349
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:52,440
Pepe! Come on! Come on, let's go.

350
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:55,730
We gotta get ready to shove off.
Come on, come on!

351
00:48:55,950 --> 00:48:59,820
Hey, kid. Everything is working out
just fine.

352
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:05,420
Now, you keep thinking about those big,
huge, shiny stones.

353
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:58,110
Tarzan?

354
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:01,560
Can I pet the lion?

355
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:03,710
Sure, Pepe. Go ahead.

356
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:27,330
See? He likes you.

357
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:29,880
Animals sense when people are friendly.

358
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,800
Did he ever eat anyone up?

359
00:50:43,050 --> 00:50:44,640
I don't think so.

360
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:47,210
You know, I found Baron
when he was that big.

361
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,640
He was smaller than you, Pepe.

362
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:53,080
Just wandering around all by himself.

363
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,040
I looked for his mother,
and I never could find her.

364
00:50:56,110 --> 00:50:58,690
Hey, he was an orpan like me!

365
00:50:58,990 --> 00:51:00,540
That's right, Pepe.

366
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,170
You've got Tarzan,
and I've got captain Sam.

367
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:24,860
Tarzan, look!

368
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:29,900
Go and tell captain Sam, Pepe.

369
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:34,450
Captain Sam, we're being attacked!

370
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:37,960
Pepe, take the wheel.
All right, chimp, my gun, fast!

371
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,930
They look like the same kind of Indians
that attacked us before.

372
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:52,370
No, captain. Take the boat to the shore,
and wait for me.

373
00:51:55,010 --> 00:51:56,560
Let me shove, Pepe!

374
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:59,840
Keep turning that wheel, boy!
I gotta get some speed up.

375
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:02,090
Come on. Come on.

376
00:54:57,620 --> 00:54:58,890
Captain?

377
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:02,090
Oh, it's you.

378
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:05,880
I never thought I'd be seeing you again.
You're all right?

379
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,320
Yeah, I'm okay.

380
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:08,810
Where's the doctor and Pepe?

381
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:12,440
Oh, I found a cave about a hundred
yards up. I hid them there.

382
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:15,460
Figured, they'd be safe there
for the night, than aboard the ship.

383
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:16,510
Good idea.

384
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:18,840
Tarzan, wait. What's going on?

385
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,270
Listen, I've been traveling this river
for the last 15 years.

386
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:24,250
Every single tribe knows me and my boat
"The Jewel of the Andes".

387
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:26,060
Never had any trouble before.

388
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:29,790
Now, suddently, in the last few days
I've been attacked twice. What gives?

389
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,520
-- Have you heard of Barcuna?
-- Barcuna?

390
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:36,490
He's the leader of an ancient killer cult
that sprung up again recently.

391
00:55:36,650 --> 00:55:38,590
And they're operating in this area.

392
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:41,110
Killer cult around here?
But what'd they want with me?

393
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:42,850
It's not you, captain. It's me.

394
00:55:42,890 --> 00:55:46,160
-- Then we can be attacked again.
-- There is that chance.

395
00:55:46,270 --> 00:55:49,640
But why don't you check on the doctor
and Pepe? I'll meet you there.

396
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:01,010
-- Now, what are you doing?
-- I've got to turn Baron loose.

397
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:04,350
-- You're turning that lion loose, why?
-- I have to, he's hungry.

398
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:08,680
All right, all right. At least wait
until I get into the cave.

399
00:57:36,930 --> 00:57:38,160
Captain.

400
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,770
It'll be best if you all stay here
in the cave.

401
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:43,870
Baron will be here soon, and I wanna
take a look around.

402
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:50,680
I've got a hunch we haven't seen the last
of those Barcuna characters.

403
00:57:51,570 --> 00:57:53,820
Got you a bit worried to, hasn't he?

404
00:57:53,850 --> 00:57:57,330
My only concern is to get to Marakeet
on time to help those people.

405
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:01,380
Another attack like this afternoon,
and you don't have to worry about
going anyplace.

406
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:03,180
Hey, you know what, doc?

407
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:06,780
First thing tomorrow morning I'm taking
the boat back to Masalva.

408
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:08,240
But you can't!

409
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:10,820
Oh, no? You just watch.

410
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:13,780
I insist that you take me to Marakeet.

411
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:16,380
Oh, doc. You can do all the insisting
you want.

412
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,570
We go back in the morning.

413
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,740
All right, captain Bishop.

414
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:27,060
Name your price, I'll pay it.

415
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:29,300
Sorry, doc.

416
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:32,530
You know, for once in my life
I ain't aiming for a buck.

417
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:35,840
The only reason I came this far
is because I heard talks of diamonds.

418
00:58:36,030 --> 00:58:38,380
Now even that doesn't interest me.

419
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:42,830
Now look, doc. All I've got in the world
is me, the kid, and that boat out there.

420
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:44,840
And I aim to hold on all three.

421
00:58:44,890 --> 00:58:47,220
And what about those people in Marakeet?

422
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:49,140
Some of them may be dying!

423
00:58:49,210 --> 00:58:52,260
Epidemic spreads fast, captain.
I can help them.

424
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,810
Now, how can you help them?

425
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:55,660
Even if you've got there at all
in one piece,

426
00:58:55,670 --> 00:58:58,740
do you think those people let you
stick them with that needle?

427
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:00,740
I can try.

428
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:04,030
Oh no, doc. You come back to Masalva
with us.

429
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:05,920
You'll be saving your own neck.

430
00:59:06,010 --> 00:59:07,790
Captain Sam?

431
00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:09,460
Yes, kid.

432
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:13,420
If we find those diamonds, we'll be rich!

433
00:59:13,570 --> 00:59:15,130
Oh, they are too big, kid.

434
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:19,230
But you always said we'll be rich.
Maybe this is our chance!

435
00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:22,000
Oh, look, Pepe.

436
00:59:22,090 --> 00:59:26,100
I've been talking about hitting it bigger
ever since I was a little guy like you
back in New York.

437
00:59:26,110 --> 00:59:28,880
And I'm gonna do it someday, too.
You just watch.

438
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:30,990
But now is not the time.

439
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:33,530
We just got too much going against us.

440
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:34,830
Oh.

441
00:59:34,930 --> 00:59:39,100
Captain. Can't you see he really
wants you to go on?

442
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:41,700
Those are his people.
He wants to help them.

443
00:59:41,710 --> 00:59:44,340
Help them? Oh, you must be kidding, doc.

444
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:48,240
After the way they treated him?
Why, they threw him like a dirty old rag!

445
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:50,160
Ain't that the truth, kid?

446
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:59,220
Sure. Who cares about those people?

447
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:02,040
I was only thinking about the diamonds.

448
01:00:02,370 --> 01:00:04,000
Now you see what I mean, doc?

449
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:06,190
Those people don't mean anything to him.

450
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:07,770
Yes.

451
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:09,770
I do see.

452
01:03:37,890 --> 01:03:39,850
Now, what happened to you?

453
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:41,780
We had a little more trouble.

454
01:03:41,790 --> 01:03:43,260
There, you see? More trouble.

455
01:03:43,270 --> 01:03:46,530
Ann... It'll be safe if you go back
with him.

456
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:48,010
What about you?

457
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:52,140
-- I have to go on.
-- So have I.

458
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:55,600
An epidemic can be just as deadly
as Barcuna.

459
01:03:55,730 --> 01:03:58,740
All right. We'll go to Marakeet
through the jungle.

460
01:03:58,810 --> 01:04:00,380
Are you two out of your mind?

461
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:02,880
I'm offering you a ticket back. Free!

462
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:06,680
And you keep insisting on risking
your lives for people you don't even know.

463
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:08,580
It don't make sense!

464
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:11,380
All right, captain.
You've made your decision.

465
01:04:11,530 --> 01:04:13,530
Okay, okay. That's fine with me.

466
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:16,180
You two go your way, me and the kid
will go ours.

467
01:04:20,210 --> 01:04:22,660
Bunch of suckers, that's all they are.

468
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:24,910
They only want to help.

469
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:28,160
Oh, fine. They'll go play that tambourine
someplace else.

470
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:30,330
And you shut up and go to sleep.

471
01:04:33,220 --> 01:04:37,360
Oh, cover yourself.
You'll catch a cold away from the fire.

472
01:04:43,010 --> 01:04:46,400
Hey, level with me, kid.
What do you really want to do?

473
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:53,340
I wanna stay with you, captain Sam.

474
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:57,200
Me and you.

475
01:04:57,810 --> 01:05:00,190
We gotta stick together.

476
01:05:02,050 --> 01:05:04,590
Yeah. Yeah, sure, kid.

477
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:08,060
You and me, right down to the wire.

478
01:05:12,030 --> 01:05:15,790
All right, all right. Till we all get
ouselves killed, we go to Marakeet.

479
01:05:42,930 --> 01:05:44,040
Here.

480
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:03,100
It's been a long time since
I've seen you, Pepe.

481
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:07,280
I thought that you should be
in mission school by now.

482
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:10,910
I have to stay with captain Sam,
Dr. Phillips.

483
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:12,830
He needs me.

484
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:16,620
Of course, he does. You save him paying
someone a regular wage.

485
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:21,450
Captain Sam says I'm learning to trade,
and that's better than getting paid.

486
01:06:21,550 --> 01:06:24,920
Aha. That sounds like good old captain Sam.

487
01:06:24,990 --> 01:06:26,890
Business is business.

488
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:29,470
Now you sound just like him.

489
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:34,280
What's that?

490
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:36,280
Haven't you ever seen one of these before?

491
01:06:36,290 --> 01:06:37,620
No.

492
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:40,370
This helps make sick people better.

493
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:42,260
-- How?
-- "How?"

494
01:06:42,380 --> 01:06:45,720
By injecting the medicine into
the sick person's arm.

495
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:47,500
Like this.

496
01:06:48,130 --> 01:06:51,770
You mean, you stick that big silver dart
into people?

497
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:54,590
Uhu. Only to help them, Pepe.

498
01:06:54,650 --> 01:06:57,090
You'll see what I mean when we get
to Marakeet.

499
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:01,010
-- Dr. Phillips.
-- Hm?

500
01:07:01,290 --> 01:07:03,580
Do you know the jungle people in Marakeet?

501
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:06,050
No, I've never been that far north.

502
01:07:07,710 --> 01:07:11,420
They will not let you use
the silver dart, Dr. Phillips.

503
01:07:11,730 --> 01:07:13,330
I was born up there.

504
01:07:13,410 --> 01:07:16,730
And I know the people.
They will not let you.

505
01:07:19,450 --> 01:07:20,620
Pepe.

506
01:07:21,050 --> 01:07:22,520
If you were sick,

507
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:25,190
and I told you this would make you better,

508
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,200
wouldn't you want me to help you?

509
01:07:30,010 --> 01:07:32,980
No. It is bad magic.

510
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:35,400
Oh, Pepe...

511
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:42,100
Your turn at the wheel, captain Sam!

512
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:50,450
Okay, Pepe, you go and rest.

513
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:53,050
Captain Sam, can I go pet the lion?

514
01:07:54,770 --> 01:07:58,330
Okay. But you make sure Tarzan
stands alongside of you.

515
01:07:58,370 --> 01:08:01,290
Are you kidding?
He'll be standing in front of me.

516
01:08:07,070 --> 01:08:09,050
Oh, he is a bright kid, ain't he, doc?

517
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:12,350
Well, I wish he blew some of his
native superstitions.

518
01:08:13,810 --> 01:08:17,250
You know, he was actually terrified
of a hypodermic needle just now?

519
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:19,540
Well, what do you expect?
The boy's from the jungle.

520
01:08:19,570 --> 01:08:21,230
But I've been personally teaching him.

521
01:08:21,310 --> 01:08:23,850
Oh, you've been teaching him, all right.

522
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:26,010
Captain Bishop.

523
01:08:26,190 --> 01:08:28,240
You make Fagan look like a saint.

524
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:30,600
Oh, doc. Now, what kind of talk is that?

525
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:34,270
Here I am, taking you clear out of my way,
and that's the thanks I get.

526
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:36,090
Who's Fagan?

527
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:21,930
You haven't told me yet, how much more
you're going to charge for taking me
to Marakeet.

528
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:24,610
Not one red cent.

529
01:09:26,290 --> 01:09:30,160
Oh, look, doc. I wanna help those poor
sick people out as much as anybody.

530
01:09:30,210 --> 01:09:34,700
You know, old captain Sam Bishop might
have strayed once or twice, but I still
got a heart.

531
01:09:35,470 --> 01:09:37,720
Medically speaking, perhaps.

532
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:41,370
Oh, come on, doc. What's eating you today?

533
01:09:41,570 --> 01:09:44,650
I just don't think you'd do anything
without putting a price tag on it.

534
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:47,220
But I said, I ain't charging you.
Now, isn't that enough?

535
01:09:47,260 --> 01:09:49,700
No. I know you too well.

536
01:09:49,810 --> 01:09:52,670
Oh, doc. Now, what I'm gonna do with you?

537
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:05,530
There she is, doc.
That's Marakeet up ahead.

538
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:46,820
That doesn't look like a truly
welcoming committee, does it?

539
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:48,270
No.

540
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:51,780
I have come to see your chief, Manlo.

541
01:11:24,770 --> 01:11:26,880
-- You are Manlo?
-- Yes.

542
01:11:27,150 --> 01:11:30,520
This is Dr. Phillips.
She brings medicine for your people.

543
01:11:30,580 --> 01:11:33,000
No medicine can help my people.

544
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:35,570
That's not true! I can help them.

545
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:37,980
Your child is sick?

546
01:11:38,020 --> 01:11:42,920
Not sick. Barcuna has put a curse
of the living dead upon my people.

547
01:11:43,050 --> 01:11:44,000
Barcuna?

548
01:11:44,030 --> 01:11:47,030
The Marakeets cannot fight his curse.

549
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:50,170
Already half of my people are dead.

550
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:53,340
It's not Barcuna, Manlo. It's a sickness.

551
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:54,670
And the doctor can help.

552
01:11:54,700 --> 01:11:57,330
It is the curse of Barcuna!

553
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:00,430
By morning my people will be destroyed.

554
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:03,250
Is this how a great chief leads
his people?

555
01:12:03,490 --> 01:12:06,890
Will you allow your village to die
without even trying to save it?

556
01:12:07,870 --> 01:12:10,570
I think I can help your child
and your people.

557
01:12:10,830 --> 01:12:12,510
Please let me try.

558
01:12:12,610 --> 01:12:15,440
This medicine... Where is it?

559
01:12:36,770 --> 01:12:40,450
It is the silver dart! Bad magic!

560
01:12:40,690 --> 01:12:42,900
Medicine, Manlo. Not magic.

561
01:12:43,070 --> 01:12:47,410
Hey look. I'm not playing here or
anything like that, I just want to help.

562
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:50,520
Perhaps if I...
If I let the doctor inject me...

563
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:55,040
Maybe good for white man, bad for Indian.

564
01:13:02,180 --> 01:13:05,100
Pepe, these are your people.

565
01:13:05,780 --> 01:13:08,580
Would you take the medicine
so they won't be afraid?

566
01:13:10,170 --> 01:13:11,400
No.

567
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:15,100
-- Not the silver dart.
-- Pepe, it won't hurt you, I promise.

568
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:16,970
Trust me, all right?

569
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:19,840
I trust you, Tarzan.

570
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:22,060
I'll do anything you want.

571
01:13:22,370 --> 01:13:24,380
-- But...
-- Pepe.

572
01:13:24,490 --> 01:13:26,300
These people will die.

573
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:31,310
Hey, come on, kid. That's a breeze.
There's nothing to it.

574
01:13:31,730 --> 01:13:33,160
Now, let's see.

575
01:13:33,260 --> 01:13:36,980
The job ought to be worth about eh... $20?

576
01:13:46,750 --> 01:13:49,010
Ought to be worth at least 25?

577
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:51,210
That's what I said, 25.

578
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:53,050
Come on, Pepe.

579
01:14:02,270 --> 01:14:05,360
Manlo, the boy is a Marakeet.

580
01:14:05,610 --> 01:14:09,490
He's willing to take the medicine to show
it won't hurt your people.

581
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:48,510
There.

582
01:14:49,130 --> 01:14:50,720
All over.

583
01:14:53,950 --> 01:14:56,890
-- You mean, you've finished?
-- Yes.

584
01:15:04,030 --> 01:15:07,170
It was a breeze. Nothing to it.

585
01:15:09,780 --> 01:15:12,330
Give the medicine to my people.

586
01:15:12,610 --> 01:15:14,820
We'll need the rest of the vaccine
from the boat.

587
01:15:14,830 --> 01:15:16,510
All right.

588
01:15:17,290 --> 01:15:19,130
"Some kid", huh?

589
01:15:19,330 --> 01:15:21,390
Must be his upbringing.

590
01:15:34,730 --> 01:15:36,800
Stack these up for the doc.

591
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,360
And these.

592
01:15:48,510 --> 01:15:51,720
Your people will show improvement
by morning.

593
01:15:55,940 --> 01:15:57,240
Manlo.

594
01:15:57,770 --> 01:15:59,980
Where will I find Barcuna?

595
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:01,820
Barcuna?

596
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:05,960
Go past the mountains, he will be there.

597
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:08,350
As soon as the sun is high.

598
01:16:08,770 --> 01:16:11,010
Destroy him, Tarzan.

599
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:16,170
Hear me,

600
01:17:16,450 --> 01:17:20,720
the spirit of the jaguar's pits!

601
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:23,950
The jungle belongs to me!

602
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:27,330
Those who obey me, live.

603
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:31,170
All others die.

604
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:34,730
You have seen me fight

605
01:17:34,830 --> 01:17:39,850
the people of Marakeet with the curse
of the living dead.

606
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:43,380
And today I will destroy them.

607
01:17:43,390 --> 01:17:46,530
No! Do not fear Barcuna!

608
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:48,440
His magic is false.

609
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:51,530
He has lied to you in order
to enslave you.

610
01:17:51,740 --> 01:17:54,440
His only strength is your fear.

611
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:58,200
There is no more curse upon the Marakeets!

612
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:01,330
The curse of Barcuna is broken.

613
01:18:02,090 --> 01:18:05,840
Barcuna's only strength is your own fear!

614
01:18:05,950 --> 01:18:07,970
You dare challenge Barcuna?

615
01:18:08,330 --> 01:18:11,920
Yes, I challenge Barcuna.

616
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:14,190
Man to man.

617
01:18:15,330 --> 01:18:17,660
Clear the ramps!

618
01:24:51,140 --> 01:24:52,130
Pepe.

619
01:24:52,270 --> 01:24:54,160
You sure you won't come back with us?

620
01:24:54,250 --> 01:24:58,250
No, captain. I want to stay here
a few days and help these people
to get started.

621
01:24:58,350 --> 01:25:00,830
Are we going to see you back in Masalva,
ain't we?

622
01:25:00,890 --> 01:25:01,940
"Ain't we?"

623
01:25:02,010 --> 01:25:04,030
Now, where did you ever learn to talk
like that?

624
01:25:04,110 --> 01:25:07,150
As soon as we get back to Masalva,
you start school.

625
01:25:07,260 --> 01:25:09,000
Oh, come on, captain.

626
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:11,420
Just because it kind of ill formed a little.

627
01:25:11,470 --> 01:25:13,800
School, mister, and that's an order.

628
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:16,660
I don't want no kid around me
that don't talk good.

629
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:19,440
You be a good boy, Pepe, and do
what the captain says.

630
01:25:19,550 --> 01:25:20,970
Yep.

631
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:23,860
-- Good bye.
-- Good bye, Tarzan.

632
01:25:23,950 --> 01:25:28,510
And you remember, anytime you wanna ride
on my little old boat, you just give me
a haley, do you hear?

633
01:25:29,010 --> 01:25:30,320
No charge?

634
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:34,250
Come on, Pepe.

635
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:38,530
Thank you for all your help.

636
01:25:39,240 --> 01:25:41,980
This is enough thanks for both of us, Ann.

637
01:25:42,430 --> 01:25:44,160
-- Good bye.
-- Good bye.

638
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:51,490
Bye!

639
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:04,530
-- Bye.
-- Bye.

640
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:57,800
THE END.
